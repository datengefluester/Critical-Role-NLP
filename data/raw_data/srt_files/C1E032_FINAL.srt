1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,274
MATT: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, a show where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice

2
00:00:03,302 --> 00:00:07,902
actors play Dungeons and Dragons. So sorry for the
tech delay. We had a few technical errors, but

3
00:00:07,902 --> 00:00:11,593
we've pushed through them. Let's go ahead and get
this show on the road. First, with your

4
00:00:11,593 --> 00:00:12,574
announcements.

5
00:00:12,574 --> 00:00:17,009
ZAC: Yeah, three really quick announcements.
Number one is tomorrow we're going to be starting

6
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:22,094
early for some special programming because you
guys tweeted at us and told us that you wanted us

7
00:00:22,094 --> 00:00:27,878
to, so Erika and Josephine are going to be playing
Tomb Raider at 1PM tomorrow; that's not on our

8
00:00:27,878 --> 00:00:31,506
schedule, but you guys wanted us to do it, and
Amy's going to come out and join them, because

9
00:00:31,506 --> 00:00:35,199
Amy's really excited about the game, too. So,
those wonderful ladies will be playing that at

10
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:38,061
1:00, and then we have Taliesin joining us for
Group Hug tomorrow.

11
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:39,582
(cheering)

12
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:43,025
ZAC: Sure you guys heard Hector yelling at you in
that nice little ad that we had, and the last

13
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:47,138
announcement that I have is that we will be a
sub-only chat tonight. This is not something

14
00:00:47,138 --> 00:00:51,542
that... we tried holding off as long we possibly
could, but we've had a lot of requests from people

15
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:56,196
to try it. So we're going to try it out tonight,
see how it goes; if it goes well, we might end up

16
00:00:56,196 --> 00:00:59,902
staying with it. But we really didn't want to,
because we wanted to keep this as open as

17
00:00:59,902 --> 00:01:03,688
possible. But we've been getting a lot of requests
to, so we're going to give it a shot and see how

18
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,005
that goes, and just wanted to let you guys know
that was up.

19
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:06,943
MATT: Thank you.

20
00:01:06,943 --> 00:01:07,946
ZAC: All I got!

21
00:01:07,946 --> 00:01:11,335
MATT: So I guess the show was a grand experiment
and now tonight's chat room will be a grand

22
00:01:11,335 --> 00:01:14,139
experiment; we'll see how things pan out. So
definitely let us know how that works for you guys

23
00:01:14,139 --> 00:01:19,199
after the show. We'll pass that feedback on or let
Zac know, so... Anyway, welcome to our crazy show.

24
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:25,832
We have some announcements to give at the top of
this, too. First, well I guess first I could say,

25
00:01:25,874 --> 00:01:31,887
tonight we have a special guest Skyping in from
New York as she finished shooting early. We have

26
00:01:31,887 --> 00:01:33,853
Ashley Johnson will be joining us tonight as
Pike.

27
00:01:33,853 --> 00:01:36,372
(cheering)

28
00:01:36,372 --> 00:01:39,454
MATT: She's almost to scale as Pike right now.
It's fun.

29
00:01:39,454 --> 00:01:40,525
(laughter)

30
00:01:40,525 --> 00:01:41,785
ASHLEY: Yes.

31
00:01:41,785 --> 00:01:44,013
MARISHA: How's the weather in New York?

32
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:53,025
ASHLEY: Oh, you know, it's just really cold and
rainy, but it's good. It's good. I've missed you

33
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:54,490
guys so bad.

34
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,237
LAURA: We missed you, Ashley.

35
00:01:56,237 --> 00:01:57,567
MARISHA and LIAM: We missed you, too.

36
00:01:57,567 --> 00:01:58,878
ASHLEY: So much!

37
00:01:58,878 --> 00:01:59,942
(laughter)

38
00:01:59,942 --> 00:02:02,838
MATT: I'm so glad you could join us tonight. You
guys are in for a treat, watching how a dungeon

39
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:06,289
master incorporates a character suddenly in the
middle of a story.

40
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:07,637
(laughter)

41
00:02:07,637 --> 00:02:09,022
SAM: Or fails at it.

42
00:02:09,022 --> 00:02:10,816
MATT: Or fails at it; we'll see.

43
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:15,400
ASHLEY: He told me five minutes ago, and he told
me what was going on, and I was like, "I'm back,

44
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,842
"can I play?" He said, "Yeah you can play. Let me
plan real quick."

45
00:02:18,842 --> 00:02:22,206
MATT: Yeah. So. Appreciate your understanding of
the delay.

46
00:02:22,206 --> 00:02:24,593
LIAM: If you can survive the Extra Life game...

47
00:02:24,593 --> 00:02:28,866
MATT: Yeah, that's true. Maintaining a narrative,
that's the hard part.

48
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:31,181
MARISHA: Never can forget.

49
00:02:31,181 --> 00:02:32,827
MATT: It's true.

50
00:02:32,827 --> 00:02:36,156
MARISHA: Never forget. The Deck of Many Things.

51
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,881
MATT: The Deck of Many Things ruins everything. Oh
my god. All right, so, next announcement, as part

52
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:44,797
of our Spotify playlists being put up on the
website. Each person has been creating Spotify

53
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:48,161
playlists around their character. This week
Keyleth went live on the website.

54
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:49,860
(cheering)

55
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,879
MATT: Had good feedback on it so far?

56
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,024
MARISHA: Yeah!

57
00:02:53,024 --> 00:02:54,163
TALIESIN: I like it.

58
00:02:54,163 --> 00:02:59,957
MARISHA: Yeah. Go listen to it. It's like what
Laura said last week; it's like weird because it's

59
00:02:59,957 --> 00:03:03,204
kind of like a vulnerable soft spot, but yeah.

60
00:03:03,204 --> 00:03:04,596
TALIESIN: I like it.

61
00:03:04,596 --> 00:03:06,561
MARISHA: Journey songs. Go check them out.

62
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,844
LAURA: Goodness.

63
00:03:07,844 --> 00:03:09,780
TRAVIS: Where do they go to do that? At the Geek
and Sundry website?

64
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,429
MARISHA: Geek and Sundry website.

65
00:03:11,429 --> 00:03:15,489
TALIESIN: Or you can, if you follow Geek and Sundry
on Spotify, you can find all of our Spotify

66
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:18,112
playlists on there.

67
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:22,191
MARISHA: Right. But you should go to Geek and
Sundry's website because we each wrote little

68
00:03:22,191 --> 00:03:23,476
descriptions.

69
00:03:23,476 --> 00:03:24,618
LAURA: Thanks, Taliesin.

70
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:26,215
TALIESIN: I'm here to ruin everything.

71
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:28,222
MATT: And we've had people spoil themselves.

72
00:03:28,222 --> 00:03:32,432
TALIESIN: Yeah, you should read our
notes. We have liner notes.

73
00:03:32,484 --> 00:03:35,839
MARISHA: And we also each picked out some of our
favorite fan arts that we've gotten.

74
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:37,575
LAURA: Yeah, we picked those ones out.

75
00:03:37,575 --> 00:03:40,174
MATT: Travis is abandoning us; he had to go.

76
00:03:40,174 --> 00:03:42,747
LAURA: He's done; he's out. Travis is creating his
playlist right now.

77
00:03:42,747 --> 00:03:49,124
MATT: Travis is like, "No!" We lost a Grog, gained
an Ashley. I'm okay with that. All right, cool, so

78
00:03:49,124 --> 00:03:58,806
next up, Wyrmwood has their Critical Role stuff
for you guys who want to buy really awesome, nice

79
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:01,197
and pricey upper-tier geek stuff.

80
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:04,593
LAURA: There are some affordable ones. There's
definitely affordable options on there as well.

81
00:04:04,593 --> 00:04:05,820
It's not all pretty expensive.

82
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,165
MARISHA: And it's Christmas coming up, man.

83
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:12,661
LIAM: It's a wide spectrum. Their website is
Wyrmwood Gaming, and the code that will get you

84
00:04:12,661 --> 00:04:16,624
free shipping on an order is CritRole. CritRole,
all one word.

85
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:24,425
MATT: Awesome. Couple other things. Also, we
tonight are putting-- we don't have Pike's because

86
00:04:24,425 --> 00:04:30,098
that was a kind of surprise, but we have new art
by our official artist Kit Buss for all the

87
00:04:30,098 --> 00:04:31,570
character portraits we'll be using tonight.

88
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,190
SAM: They're really good.

89
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,924
MARISHA: They're up? They're below us?

90
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:36,449
LAURA: So you can see them?

91
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:37,488
MATT: You can see them.

92
00:04:37,488 --> 00:04:40,572
LAURA: I'm so excited! I'm looking down at it
right now.

93
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,175
MATT: Thank you so much Kit.

94
00:04:42,175 --> 00:04:43,846
TALIESIN: I have sideburns!

95
00:04:43,846 --> 00:04:45,168
MARISHA: We look hot.

96
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:46,431
SAM: Pink and proud.

97
00:04:46,431 --> 00:04:49,040
TALIESIN: I'm a little scruffy. I've seen some
shit.

98
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,717
MARISHA: Yeah, Grog has a beard. Look at Grog and
his beard over there.

99
00:04:51,717 --> 00:04:53,779
LAURA: Grog looks good with a beard.

100
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:55,239
MARISHA: It's over there.

101
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:57,458
TALIESIN: It's down and to our left.

102
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:01,440
MARISHA: Yeah, they have it in order as to what
we're sitting.

103
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,745
LAURA: Oh really? I can't see it.

104
00:05:02,745 --> 00:05:04,061
SAM: Well it's not there, either.

105
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:05,174
TALIESIN: It's underneath the tables.

106
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:06,575
LAURA: Oh, right. That's Ashley. What am I doing?

107
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:09,704
SAM: All screens have our show on them.

108
00:05:09,704 --> 00:05:17,474
MATT: (laughs) Everything. We take over. Great.
Next announcement is for all you waiting for the

109
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:21,213
Critmas episode; I know that they divided the
recent upload into two different parts, the

110
00:05:21,213 --> 00:05:25,920
Critmas being its own kind of individual upload.
I've been told that goes up tomorrow. So, those of

111
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,667
you who are, "Where has the episode?" It'll be up
there tomorrow for you to watch. And you get to

112
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:34,805
see all the amazing things that a bunch of fans
made and sent out and all the lovey-dovey awesome

113
00:05:34,805 --> 00:05:39,409
connection stuff that we stayed here until
midnight last week having fun with, so check it

114
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:47,152
out tomorrow. It's a lot of fun. All right, also,
let's see, reminder we have awesome t-shirts

115
00:05:47,152 --> 00:05:53,623
online like the one that Travis is wearing--
it's been one of those days-- Taliesin is also

116
00:05:53,729 --> 00:06:00,038
wearing it. And the newer one that Laura is
wearing. Those are available. We also have the

117
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:07,039
keychains and the necklaces, too, so those are
cool; those are up. Games that came out this week?

118
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,247
Fallout 4 came out this week, as I'm sure many of
you are aware.

119
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:15,725
MARISHA: And we've all been playing it. Foaming at
mouth!

120
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:17,061
MATT: Exactly.

121
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:23,219
SAM: Who's in it? Matt, you're in it. Is it just
Matt? Is that it? Who else is in it?

122
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:24,869
MARISHA: Yeah, who else is in it? Anyone else?

123
00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:26,340
LIAM, LAURA, SAM, and TALIESIN: I'm not in it.

124
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,402
MARISHA: Just Matt?

125
00:06:27,402 --> 00:06:28,204
LAURA: Are you in it?

126
00:06:28,204 --> 00:06:29,292
TRAVIS: I'm the dog.

127
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:30,434
(laughter)

128
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:33,078
LIAM: I did enough voices for Fallout: New Vegas.

129
00:06:33,078 --> 00:06:36,645
SAM: Yeah, I was all over New Vegas, as well, so
they cut me out.

130
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:39,944
MARISHA: We recently found you, though.

131
00:06:39,944 --> 00:06:41,538
MATT: Yeah, in the game.

132
00:06:41,538 --> 00:06:47,785
MARISHA: And what's funny was, his character,
McCreedy, he starts bitching at you for picking up

133
00:06:47,785 --> 00:06:56,464
a lot of junk, which Matt does to me in real life.
Yeah, Matt was like, "Do I really?" And I was

134
00:06:56,464 --> 00:06:59,332
getting it from two fronts. I'm like, "God damn
it."

135
00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:01,730
LAURA: I'm a straight-up hoarder in Fallout.

136
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:07,436
MARISHA: I'm a hoarder. I need more toy cars. I
don't have enough screws!

137
00:07:07,436 --> 00:07:08,989
LAURA: I need screws!

138
00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:10,385
MARISHA: Screws are fucking hard to come by.

139
00:07:10,385 --> 00:07:15,460
LAURA: Because that's the only way you can upgrade
your guns!

140
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,114
SAM: (shushing noises)

141
00:07:17,114 --> 00:07:19,827
LIAM: This is the entertainment you subscribed
for.

142
00:07:19,827 --> 00:07:22,203
(laughter)

143
00:07:22,203 --> 00:07:24,801
ZAC: I don't have to do this on this show almost
ever, but let's go, guys. Come on.

144
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:28,243
MATT: So anyway, I play McCreedy and Z-114.

145
00:07:28,243 --> 00:07:31,684
TALIESIN: BlizzCon, oh yeah.

146
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:32,843
MATT: Oh yeah, I'm getting there.

147
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:34,142
TALIESIN: Okay, you're getting there.

148
00:07:34,142 --> 00:07:37,904
MATT: Also, a bunch of us went to BlizzCon this
past weekend, which had a lot of fun, fun panels

149
00:07:37,904 --> 00:07:40,854
and stuff, and we met a whole bunch of Critters
that were there as well.

150
00:07:40,854 --> 00:07:42,378
TALIESIN: So many Critters.

151
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,139
MATT: It was really cool. We had kind of an
impromptu signing for a while, and we had a bunch

152
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:51,136
of very positive conversations with a bunch of you
cool people, so those who came out and said hello:

153
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,168
hello! It was great meeting you all.

154
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:54,428
MARISHA: Thanks for seeing us.

155
00:07:54,428 --> 00:07:55,541
TALIESIN: Nice to see you.

156
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,859
MATT: We had a good time. It was fun, and Liam was
all over BlizzCon.

157
00:07:58,859 --> 00:08:02,146
LIAM: Yes, I was prom queen at BlizzCon this
year.

158
00:08:02,146 --> 00:08:09,526
MATT: (laughs) It was pretty rad. All right,
couple last things. Oh, today, a few of us went

159
00:08:09,526 --> 00:08:14,250
with other fantastic hosts on our Twitch channel
network to the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles

160
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:20,483
and handed over our donation from the Extra
Life charity we've been doing for the past month

161
00:08:20,562 --> 00:08:25,975
or so that you guys made happen. It was incredible
to see the outreach everyone put into it, and we

162
00:08:25,975 --> 00:08:32,855
ended up handing over pretty much $115,000 dollars
to the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles.

163
00:08:32,855 --> 00:08:34,966
LAURA: Congratulations, you guys!

164
00:08:34,966 --> 00:08:37,486
MATT: Congratulations, you guys.

165
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:39,117
It's a wonderful facility.

166
00:08:39,188 --> 00:08:40,488
MARISHA: And the hospital was amazing.

167
00:08:40,488 --> 00:08:41,412
TALIESIN: Yeah.

168
00:08:41,412 --> 00:08:42,653
MARISHA: It's a good hospital.

169
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:46,057
LIAM: Yeah, it's such a great tour. They have so
many creative things that I've never seen in

170
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:50,807
hospitals-- I got kids-- or would've thought they
had a room for teenagers; it was cool and had

171
00:08:50,807 --> 00:08:53,040
teenage stuff in it. It was awesome.

172
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,392
MARISHA: Oh yeah; they have a giveaway library,
where they give a book to a kid every day.

173
00:08:56,392 --> 00:08:57,932
TALIESIN: With little toadstools.

174
00:08:57,932 --> 00:08:59,745
LIAM: Give out 32,000 books a year.

175
00:08:59,745 --> 00:09:00,649
MARISHA: Yeah.

176
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:02,414
LIAM: Not lend, give books to kids.

177
00:09:02,414 --> 00:09:03,518
SAM: That's a lot!

178
00:09:03,518 --> 00:09:07,901
MARISHA: So we're actually going to be talking
about that later, but they apparently have a book

179
00:09:07,901 --> 00:09:12,834
wishlist, so we're going to be getting that from
them and sharing it to you guys because these

180
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:14,550
people need books.

181
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,023
ASHLEY: Wait, what the heck? How much money?

182
00:09:17,096 --> 00:09:18,493
(laughter)

183
00:09:18,493 --> 00:09:20,849
MATT: $115,000.

184
00:09:20,849 --> 00:09:27,688
ASHLEY: What? I saw the check on my iPad, and I
thought it said 15. I was like, "Wow, that's so

185
00:09:27,725 --> 00:09:31,273
"much money. Holy crap!" There's an extra one in
front of that.

186
00:09:31,273 --> 00:09:33,055
(laughter)

187
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:39,176
MATT: That's you guys. You guys are incredible.
And last but not least, we have an announcement,

188
00:09:39,176 --> 00:09:41,907
do you guys want to handle this one?

189
00:09:41,907 --> 00:09:44,800
TALIESIN: Oh god. Yeah! I forgot about that!

190
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,727
MARISHA: Yeah, high five! We're high-fiving and no
one knows about what we're high-fiving over. So we

191
00:09:50,727 --> 00:09:56,482
have a fun new announcement for everybody. Aren't
you excited?

192
00:09:56,482 --> 00:09:57,899
SAM: I'm ready to announce it.

193
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,019
MARISHA: You're so ready.

194
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:00,087
SAM: What is it?

195
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:04,472
MARISHA: Okay, so, Critical Role is finally
getting a weekly comic strip.

196
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:05,743
SAM: Is that true?

197
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:06,790
MARISHA: Yes!

198
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,528
SAM: I'm famous!

199
00:10:08,528 --> 00:10:09,835
MARISHA: Yes!

200
00:10:09,835 --> 00:10:11,902
(laughter)

201
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:12,735
SAM: I did it!

202
00:10:12,735 --> 00:10:13,701
TALIESIN: You've made it.

203
00:10:13,701 --> 00:10:14,863
SAM: I did it!

204
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:19,428
MARISHA: We're getting a comic, you guys. It's
starting off as a comic strip. So it is going to

205
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:20,334
be coming--

206
00:10:20,334 --> 00:10:21,483
SAM: In newspapers everywhere?

207
00:10:21,483 --> 00:10:28,736
MARISHA: In newspapers everywhere online if the
website is named GeekandSundry.com. So,

208
00:10:28,736 --> 00:10:34,486
everywhere. Yes, and so it's going to be starting
next Wednesday. They're going to be releasing

209
00:10:34,612 --> 00:10:35,803
weekly on Wednesdays.

210
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:36,759
SAM: I love it.

211
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:39,099
TALIESIN: We've got work to do.

212
00:10:39,099 --> 00:10:40,315
MARISHA: I know.

213
00:10:40,315 --> 00:10:41,569
TALIESIN: I know; it's crazy.

214
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:47,744
MARISHA: The first run that we're going to do--
they're going to be semi-episodic, I guess, like

215
00:10:47,744 --> 00:10:49,623
loose story line little vignettes.

216
00:10:49,623 --> 00:10:53,289
TALIESIN: Like a comic strip. Like a Doonesbury, so
you get little segments that all lead up into a

217
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:54,714
larger thing.

218
00:10:54,714 --> 00:11:02,148
MARISHA: And the first storyline is going to be
our Winter's Crest festival. So it'll be thematic.

219
00:11:02,148 --> 00:11:09,659
It will go all the way up until Christmas, and our
first artist is the amazing Wendy Green,

220
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:11,015
wendydoodles.

221
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:13,039
(cheering)

222
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,576
MARISHA: So we're going to be switching out
artists as we go through different story arcs, and

223
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:18,801
Wendy's our first one.

224
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:24,333
TALIESIN: She's going to be telling the story of
our very first winter festival, which is-- should

225
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:28,007
we tell them is also mixed with other events in
Critical Role history?

226
00:11:28,007 --> 00:11:29,835
MARISHA: Yes. You'll see

227
00:11:29,835 --> 00:11:31,482
TALIESIN: You'll see. It be fabulous.

228
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,611
TRAVIS: Much to come.

229
00:11:32,611 --> 00:11:34,242
LAURA and MARISHA: Much to come.

230
00:11:34,242 --> 00:11:35,815
MARISHA: But definitely go check that out
because--

231
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:36,892
SAM: Not yet, though.

232
00:11:36,892 --> 00:11:38,460
MARISHA: Not yet, next week.

233
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,025
LAURA: It's up next week? Holy moly.

234
00:11:41,025 --> 00:11:44,864
MARISHA: Next week. The first one goes out on
Wednesday. So the more people who go and look at

235
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:47,071
it, the more we may get later.

236
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:52,163
TALIESIN: Go check it out because the more people
who check it out, the more likely they are to say,

237
00:11:52,163 --> 00:11:54,545
"This deserves to be an entire comic book."

238
00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:58,804
SAM: Big dreams, Taliesin, big dreams.

239
00:11:58,804 --> 00:12:03,750
TALIESIN: With animation and craziness and
hyperlinks and all sorts of things.

240
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,396
MATT: Yeah, we want to make more content for
everyone, so if you like the content, then go look

241
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:10,915
at the content that shows that we could possibly
do more content.

242
00:12:10,915 --> 00:12:12,461
LIAM: We enjoy doing this.

243
00:12:12,461 --> 00:12:15,814
MARISHA: Yes. We want to see how far this ship
will sail.

244
00:12:15,814 --> 00:12:19,554
MATT: So yeah. I think that's all our
announcements.

245
00:12:19,554 --> 00:12:21,703
ASHLEY: Maybe it'll ship to New York?

246
00:12:21,703 --> 00:12:23,538
(laughter)

247
00:12:23,538 --> 00:12:26,099
ASHLEY: Hey, I had to try.

248
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:27,973
(laughter)

249
00:12:27,973 --> 00:12:30,499
LIAM: It's so good to have you here.

250
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,290
MATT: I know, I'm so glad you could be here, Ashley.

251
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,535
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, I wish were there in person.

252
00:12:34,605 --> 00:12:35,462
LAURA: Me, too.

253
00:12:35,462 --> 00:12:36,591
ASHLEY: But soon.

254
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:38,945
MATT: Yep. Have you got your dice and your
character sheets ready?

255
00:12:38,945 --> 00:12:40,910
LIAM: You got your gear, Johnson?

256
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,853
MATT: You ready?

257
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:46,540
ASHLEY: I got all my gear. I'm so nervous and so
excited. I feel like I don't know how to play

258
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,735
anymore!

259
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:49,379
TALIESIN: It's like falling off a bicycle; it's
easy.

260
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:50,424
ASHLEY: Yeah.

261
00:12:50,424 --> 00:12:54,431
MATT: So, with that, let's go ahead and kick back
into the mood of the current venture into

262
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:55,475
Whitestone.

263
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:58,384
LAURA: Oh no.

264
00:12:58,384 --> 00:13:00,022
TRAVIS: Make the beat drop.

265
00:13:00,022 --> 00:13:01,333
MATT: Now.

266
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,858
SAM: Okay, here we go.

267
00:13:02,858 --> 00:13:08,433
MATT: The party of Vox Machina, having traveled
across Tal'Dorei to the city of Whitestone to seek

268
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:14,382
a pair of seemingly vicious and evil individuals
known as Lord and Lady Briarwood, members of the

269
00:13:14,382 --> 00:13:20,232
past that Percy's family fell to oh so many years
ago, leaving what he thought was the sole survivor

270
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:28,007
to the de Rolo family. Upon coming to Whitestone,
finding its people downtrodden and oppressed by

271
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:33,009
the Briarwood rule as well as the cutthroats
and mercenaries that they had brought along with

272
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:40,229
them when they took the city, now given lordship
and plots of land and rule over this entire town.

273
00:13:40,229 --> 00:13:48,137
The word began to spread of possible new rebellion
as you charged through the town, leaving burned

274
00:13:48,137 --> 00:13:55,981
marks, burned houses, and very slaughtered people
in the process. Very bad people. As these murmurs

275
00:13:55,981 --> 00:14:00,944
continue to roll and coalesce, you spoke to a
number of individuals in the city that were

276
00:14:00,944 --> 00:14:07,002
involved in previous failed rebellions and seemed
to build up what may be the last chance for

277
00:14:07,002 --> 00:14:11,695
Whitestone. As part of this information was
revealed that Percy's thought-dead sister

278
00:14:11,695 --> 00:14:18,578
Cassandra still existed within the castle and had
been what people thought the only living de Rolo

279
00:14:18,578 --> 00:14:21,226
and bastion of hope in the city. Now there were
two.

280
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:28,304
Upon triggering the initiation of this, the party
split, Scanlan Shorthalt running to one of the

281
00:14:28,304 --> 00:14:33,549
nobles while the rest of the party went to the
other to set a diversion at the same time.

282
00:14:33,549 --> 00:14:39,631
(laughs) It may not have worked out as intended,
but it definitely worked, as we had an epic bard

283
00:14:39,631 --> 00:14:46,822
versus goliath rainstorm rooftop showdown. The
rest of the party made their way into Count

284
00:14:46,822 --> 00:14:56,300
Tylieri's home, destroyed his vampiric self, and
got some information out of the guards before

285
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,260
escaping into the town, which has now gone into
chaos.

286
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:04,388
Many of townsfolk have become the militia that
they've been preparing to be. Armored with

287
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:08,843
whatever they can find, they've managed to take down a
number of the large, hulking zombie giant

288
00:15:08,843 --> 00:15:13,342
guardians throughout the city. Many lives were
lost in the process, and the battle is ongoing. As

289
00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:16,948
you rushed towards the center of the town to check
in on the Sun Tree, finding all the previous

290
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:23,540
bodies that resembled members of Vox Machina cut
from its boughs, you saw swarming in towards the

291
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:29,153
center of the city a large horde of skeletal
undead, clattering forth into the dark.

292
00:15:29,153 --> 00:15:33,876
As the sun has now set over the horizon, the rain
beginning to pour heavily into the center of the

293
00:15:33,876 --> 00:15:41,015
town. There was efforts meant to keep the army at
bay as you all rushed towards the west to escape

294
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,958
the immediate fray, and that was where we left off
last session.

295
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,507
SAM: Shit.

296
00:15:47,507 --> 00:15:49,099
TRAVIS: We fucking run.

297
00:15:49,099 --> 00:15:51,998
LAURA: Are we still running? Are we still running
away?

298
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:54,317
SAM: We just got to the tree line, right?

299
00:15:54,317 --> 00:15:55,764
MATT: You guys haven't gotten to the tree line
yet, no.

300
00:15:55,764 --> 00:15:56,674
SAM: Oh, Jesus.

301
00:15:56,674 --> 00:15:57,734
TALIESIN: We are still running.

302
00:15:57,734 --> 00:15:58,780
LAURA: We're heading out of town.

303
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,945
TRAVIS: There's a shit-load of skeletons behind
us.

304
00:15:59,945 --> 00:16:01,631
LAURA: Are they right behind us? I'm still riding
Trinket?

305
00:16:01,631 --> 00:16:06,627
MATT: At this time, you are on Trinket. The rest
of you are running through the muddy streets. Your

306
00:16:06,627 --> 00:16:09,380
feet are slick against the ground, and you have to
catch yourself every now and then from not

307
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,717
tumbling forward.

308
00:16:10,717 --> 00:16:12,321
TRAVIS: Dust of Tracelessness?

309
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:15,136
LAURA: Are the skeletons still behind us? Can we
see them?

310
00:16:15,136 --> 00:16:21,975
MATT: As you glance over, they're just now
starting to pour from the town square itself, and

311
00:16:21,975 --> 00:16:28,953
it was hard to see the exact number, but from your
perspective in the darkened kind of just

312
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:32,170
post-sunset light, you didn't see the end of it.

313
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,075
TALIESIN: Whoa, triple digits.

314
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:38,916
MATT: Possibly. From what you can tell in the
middle of the chaos from rushing. There was a zombie

315
00:16:38,984 --> 00:16:43,959
giant behind you that did manage to finish off
some of the villagers before coming after you. In

316
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:48,989
your haste in escape with the help of a few of you
individuals who managed to tear it down,

317
00:16:48,989 --> 00:16:52,138
slaughtering it as it gave chase through the city
street.

318
00:16:52,138 --> 00:16:58,753
As you guys are now looking behind and seeing this
undead horde pouring into the central road that

319
00:16:58,753 --> 00:17:04,904
you're traveling along, you hear a voice ring out
from the other direction, toward where you guys

320
00:17:04,904 --> 00:17:10,920
are running. For a second, it's hard to make out
what it is, but the voice is suddenly readily

321
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,483
familiar; it says, "There! Run! Aid them!"

322
00:17:15,483 --> 00:17:19,496
And as you guys glance away from the army and back
towards the path where you were traveling, you see

323
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:26,213
what looks to be about ten armed villagers,
various pieces of armor, some nicer than others,

324
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:31,213
some have seen some use over time, but
nevertheless serviceable and functional. You see

325
00:17:31,213 --> 00:17:38,374
at the front of them, Brother Yennan. Sorry,
Keeper Yennan is at the front of them armored up,

326
00:17:38,374 --> 00:17:43,162
shield at his side, holding aloft the holy symbol
of Erathis in his hand, and they're all just

327
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,992
running towards you guys (heavy footfalls).

328
00:17:45,992 --> 00:17:48,143
MARISHA: We can't leave.

329
00:17:48,143 --> 00:17:52,341
LAURA: Can I trail behind on Trinket and try to
cast Conjure Barrage at the incoming skeletons?

330
00:17:52,341 --> 00:17:57,095
MATT: You'd probably have to slow down to do that,
because you're a good, like, probably 50, 60 feet

331
00:17:57,095 --> 00:18:01,437
away from them, if not a little further. You guys
are moving faster than them, so, that even the

332
00:18:01,437 --> 00:18:03,511
chase, they're not very quick entities.

333
00:18:03,511 --> 00:18:06,602
LIAM: So we're 50 or 60 feet away from the
skeletons, and how far are we away from the

334
00:18:06,602 --> 00:18:08,104
villagers that are coming in the other direction?

335
00:18:08,104 --> 00:18:10,110
MATT: They're about a hundred feet from you and
closing.

336
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,738
TRAVIS: I would advise bringing them with us
instead of stopping.

337
00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:16,627
LAURA: But all the villagers that aren't in armor
are still in town.

338
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:18,684
TRAVIS: Shit happens.

339
00:18:18,684 --> 00:18:21,580
MARISHA: I'm running back. I'm going back towards
the skeletons.

340
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:26,966
LAURA: I was carrying you. You're on Trinket with
me, aren't you? Can he carry both of us?

341
00:18:26,966 --> 00:18:28,487
LIAM: No, I was pulling her by the arm.

342
00:18:28,487 --> 00:18:31,661
MARISHA: I break from Vax's grasp and start
running back

343
00:18:31,661 --> 00:18:35,198
MATT: Go ahead and make-- this is technically
breaking a grapple.

344
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:40,374
LAURA: I do want to trail back a little on Trinket
and try to cast Conjure Barrage as we're running.

345
00:18:40,374 --> 00:18:45,538
MATT: Okay, so, so Trinket begins to turn around.
You're fighting. It would be either acrobatics or

346
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:47,816
athletics versus your athletics.

347
00:18:47,816 --> 00:18:52,572
MARISHA: Athletics. Ooh, I rolled an 18.

348
00:18:52,572 --> 00:18:54,065
SAM: Five!

349
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:58,573
MATT: With that, the slick rain across her forearm
(swish) she squeaks her arm out from your grasp,

350
00:18:58,573 --> 00:19:03,078
and with that moment, you feel her disappear as
she rushes back towards this undead onslaught.

351
00:19:03,078 --> 00:19:04,428
SAM: You never could keep a lady.

352
00:19:04,428 --> 00:19:05,705
(laughter)

353
00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:07,674
LIAM: I immediately pivot around and follow.

354
00:19:07,674 --> 00:19:08,761
TALIESIN: Ditto.

355
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:12,753
MARISHA: I start conjuring up a 4th-level Flaming
Sphere.

356
00:19:12,753 --> 00:19:16,971
MATT: Keep in mind you still have Call Lightning
coming, so you would be losing the Call Lightning

357
00:19:16,971 --> 00:19:18,191
at this time.

358
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,288
MARISHA: Flaming Sphere.

359
00:19:19,288 --> 00:19:22,387
MATT: Okay. So with that, the darkened clouds that
had gathered begin to slowly disperse as you begin

360
00:19:22,387 --> 00:19:27,856
to focus, running forward. As you are charging,
using the momentum, the air around you begins to

361
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:33,582
slowly grow and ignite before a ball of flame
bursts into your peripheral, and you can control

362
00:19:33,582 --> 00:19:34,821
it at will.

363
00:19:34,821 --> 00:19:37,791
MARISHA: Okay, how far away is the horde?

364
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:42,867
MATT: At this point now, they're about 30 feet
away. Since you went right back towards them as

365
00:19:42,867 --> 00:19:44,127
opposed to running away.

366
00:19:44,127 --> 00:19:45,476
LAURA: Am I in front of her?

367
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:50,625
MATT: You're now, because you gave chase shortly
after she ran off, so you guys are about tandem.

368
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:57,853
MARISHA: Okay, here's my question. Are they
funneling down one main street? How wide is that

369
00:19:57,853 --> 00:19:58,675
street?

370
00:19:58,675 --> 00:19:59,915
MATT: About 20 feet.

371
00:19:59,915 --> 00:20:04,371
MARISHA: Okay, with my flaming sphere hovering
above me, I'm going to throw up a wall of stone.

372
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:09,684
LAURA: Okay wait, not before I shoot my Conjure
Barrage, because I said I wanted to fucking do it

373
00:20:09,684 --> 00:20:10,802
before you did that.

374
00:20:10,802 --> 00:20:12,322
MARISHA: Conjure a barrage first.

375
00:20:12,322 --> 00:20:13,539
MATT: All right, so Conjure Barrage.

376
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:15,138
LAURA: (laughs) Don't fucking block my arrows.

377
00:20:15,138 --> 00:20:16,883
MATT: What, what's the distance on Conjure
Barrage?

378
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,955
LAURA: I think it's a 60-foot cone.

379
00:20:18,955 --> 00:20:23,953
MATT: Okay, then yeah, you can definitely attempt
that. Okay. So, as you create this sphere, and

380
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:26,557
it's rolling to your side as you begin to
concentrate and look over your shoulder, and you

381
00:20:26,557 --> 00:20:31,586
see Trinket (heavy steps) running up, with just
mud slung as each one of his claws begins digging

382
00:20:31,586 --> 00:20:36,875
into the earth, pulling him forward. (bear roars)
On his back, you see Vex pull out an arrow, pull

383
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:40,442
back, and concentrate. The arrow itself seems to
split and shatter in her hand, almost like the

384
00:20:40,442 --> 00:20:46,158
wood itself divides into five or six different
shards. As you release the arrow, it bursts into a

385
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:52,763
funneling cloud of sharp wooden splinters that
fires out from the front of you. What's the DC on

386
00:20:52,763 --> 00:20:55,422
that spell?

387
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,321
LAURA: It would be 15.

388
00:20:57,321 --> 00:20:59,330
MATT: 15 DC, and is that dex?

389
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,072
LAURA: Dexterity, yeah.

390
00:21:01,072 --> 00:21:03,506
MATT: Dexterity. All righty.

391
00:21:03,506 --> 00:21:09,440
LIAM: He's just got to roll for a hundred
skeletons.

392
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,830
LAURA: I know, no problem.

393
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,318
MATT: The ones that are in range would be about 12
at that point.

394
00:21:14,318 --> 00:21:16,675
MARISHA: (scoffs) Only 12.

395
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:25,776
MATT: Okay. Given the average of rolls there, the
explosion of splinters just shoots outward, just

396
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:31,315
completely disintegrating the first row of about
five or six of them. About five or six past them

397
00:21:31,315 --> 00:21:36,300
get a bunch of splinter in their bone, their rib
cages shatter open, and they (skeletal gargle) try

398
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,747
and move forward before they collapse in on their
own structure and (clatter) scatter into the mud.

399
00:21:39,747 --> 00:21:42,705
Let's say you destroyed ten of them.

400
00:21:42,705 --> 00:21:43,714
LAURA: Okay.

401
00:21:43,714 --> 00:21:47,462
MATT: You can still see about 50 or 60 slow
pushing towards you at this point in time.

402
00:21:47,462 --> 00:21:48,782
Keyleth.

403
00:21:48,782 --> 00:21:51,993
MARISHA: Okay, I throw up a wall of stone. Am I
near the Sun Tree again?

404
00:21:51,993 --> 00:21:54,878
LAURA: We've left the Sun Tree.

405
00:21:54,878 --> 00:21:58,513
MATT: You guys left the Sun Tree, and you've gone
westward, it would be from your perspective.

406
00:21:58,513 --> 00:22:01,917
Westward across the city, towards the treeline.

407
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:03,691
SAM: And now we're doubling back.

408
00:22:03,691 --> 00:22:07,434
MATT: You're now doubling back. At this point,
however, the undead horde has filtered into the

409
00:22:07,434 --> 00:22:10,371
town square and is currently between you and the
Sun Tree.

410
00:22:10,425 --> 00:22:16,715
MARISHA: Okay, so what I'm going to do is, I want
to conjure it from underneath me, so as I see them

411
00:22:16,715 --> 00:22:21,822
filtering up, I want to pop it up right from
underneath me to where I'm on top of it.

412
00:22:21,822 --> 00:22:28,600
MATT: Okay, and the width of it's going to cover
the entire street? Okay. (swoosh) The wall of

413
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,446
stone lifts you up at its maximum height. What's
the maximum height of that spell?

414
00:22:32,446 --> 00:22:38,729
TRAVIS: Keep that cast hand feeling firm.

415
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:40,661
MARISHA: Ten feet.

416
00:22:40,661 --> 00:22:43,527
LAURA: The hand went down, the spell went away.

417
00:22:43,527 --> 00:22:45,331
MARISHA: Ten foot by ten foot panels.

418
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:50,951
MATT: Can you repeat that? I lost my phone for my
app, so I'm going to use this book here.

419
00:22:50,951 --> 00:22:52,285
So, ten feet?

420
00:22:52,285 --> 00:22:53,187
MARISHA: Ten feet.

421
00:22:53,187 --> 00:22:58,573
MATT: All right so, (whoosh) you're lifted ten
feet up into the air. You can now see, about to

422
00:22:58,573 --> 00:23:04,127
crash into the wall, what looks 70 or so skeletons
just (crashing noise) scraping into it. You guys

423
00:23:04,127 --> 00:23:08,723
can all of a sudden hear through the rainfall in
the distance this scratching of metal shields and

424
00:23:08,723 --> 00:23:13,133
blades and bones scraping at the stone wall, and
(skeletal hissing) hissing and clattering.

425
00:23:13,133 --> 00:23:19,704
MARISHA: So I'm going to take the fire sphere, and
just start funneling it right down and start

426
00:23:19,704 --> 00:23:21,808
cleaning house.

427
00:23:21,808 --> 00:23:23,574
MATT: Okay.

428
00:23:23,574 --> 00:23:24,851
LAURA: Beyond the wall?

429
00:23:24,851 --> 00:23:28,601
MARISHA: Just yeah, right into the thick mess of
them.

430
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:35,897
MATT: Okay. The flaming sphere begins to move over
the wall. You've done your action, and you begin

431
00:23:35,897 --> 00:23:39,751
to push that forward, because the sphere moving
through you would get to about your space. So next

432
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,954
turn we'll get to that. You guys have caught up to
the wall now. The rest of you have turned around

433
00:23:43,954 --> 00:23:44,764
with her.

434
00:23:44,764 --> 00:23:48,378
SAM: Yeah, I ran for a few more feet, and then I
looked around and no one else was running with me,

435
00:23:48,378 --> 00:23:53,330
so I turned around and restarted running back with
my little gnome legs. (panting)

436
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,003
MATT: Okay. Percy.

437
00:23:55,003 --> 00:23:56,731
TALIESIN: I'm climbing the wall.

438
00:23:56,731 --> 00:23:58,231
LIAM: Climbing the wall.

439
00:23:58,231 --> 00:24:02,864
MATT: Okay. You guys get up on top of the wall.
It's about four or five feet thick; it's a little

440
00:24:02,864 --> 00:24:05,172
precarious, but not too much to really bother you
guys.

441
00:24:05,172 --> 00:24:10,369
You get to the top and you look over and you see
this sea of thrashing about skeletal entities,

442
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:16,829
some looking fresher than others, and all intent
on trying to find some way-- and you start to see

443
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:19,923
some of them starting to climb up over each other
to get to the height of the wall.

444
00:24:19,923 --> 00:24:24,445
TALIESIN: I'm just going to hold and anybody who
gets too close-- I'm just going to take a shot at

445
00:24:24,445 --> 00:24:26,089
anything that gets too close.

446
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,318
MATT: Okay.

447
00:24:27,318 --> 00:24:29,481
TRAVIS: Can you see any giants from up there?

448
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:31,706
TALIESIN: Can I see any giants from up there?

449
00:24:31,706 --> 00:24:33,684
MATT: Make a perception check.

450
00:24:33,684 --> 00:24:39,943
SAM: While he's doing that, I'm yelling at Grog,
"Grog! Throw me up over the wall!

451
00:24:39,943 --> 00:24:41,988
"At least to the top!"

452
00:24:41,988 --> 00:24:45,161
TALIESIN: I rolled a perception of ten.

453
00:24:45,161 --> 00:24:50,853
MATT: The rainfall is too thick. Right now, your
vision is so obscured that even beyond 50, 60 feet

454
00:24:50,853 --> 00:24:52,783
it starts getting a little hard to make out
details.

455
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,110
TRAVIS: Are you sure?

456
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:59,806
LIAM: I turn back towards the villagers, who are
probably running up at this point and yell, "Fire!

457
00:24:59,806 --> 00:25:01,848
"Bring fire!"

458
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:07,327
MATT: The Keeper says, "Fire won't help, but I
can."

459
00:25:07,327 --> 00:25:08,947
SAM and LAURA: Oh.

460
00:25:08,947 --> 00:25:09,839
TALIESIN: Whoa.

461
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:13,701
MATT: "And so can she." As he looks over his
shoulder, you can see the villagers are parting,

462
00:25:13,701 --> 00:25:20,596
and there is, running behind them, this form of a
small humanoid armored entity, but glowing. Her

463
00:25:20,596 --> 00:25:28,154
actual form is comprised of glowing, radiant
energy, like an actual avatar of Sarenrae in the

464
00:25:28,154 --> 00:25:33,731
form of a tiny gnome cleric, just charging through
the rain, each droplet of rain that hits her body

465
00:25:33,731 --> 00:25:37,771
(sizzling) just immediately evaporates on impact,
and she comes charging towards you guys.

466
00:25:37,771 --> 00:25:40,864
TALIESIN: I'm reaching down to help her up on the
top of the wall.

467
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:45,741
MARISHA: Oh my God. Keyleth thinks she died.
Keyleth thinks she's dead.

468
00:25:45,741 --> 00:25:50,731
LIAM: I'm grabbing Percy's arm and lowering him
down lower because she's short.

469
00:25:50,731 --> 00:25:57,596
MATT: All right, as you guys reach down and she
runs up, Keeper Yennan reaches up and grabs on the

470
00:25:57,596 --> 00:26:01,456
arm as well as she gets up and the two of them
together lift up on top, and as you grab her arm,

471
00:26:01,456 --> 00:26:06,116
it's strange. It's warm to the touch, warmer than
a natural arm, and it doesn't have full physical

472
00:26:06,116 --> 00:26:10,894
essence to it. It's almost like she's partially an
apparition of her physical self. There is

473
00:26:10,894 --> 00:26:15,100
purchase. There is an actual form to it, but it
doesn't feel fully solid.

474
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,277
SAM: She's lost weight!

475
00:26:17,277 --> 00:26:19,535
(laughter)

476
00:26:19,535 --> 00:26:21,334
TALIESIN: You look so thin!

477
00:26:21,334 --> 00:26:25,866
MATT: With that, you lift her up, and she's
lighter than you recall, and almost like a gentle

478
00:26:25,866 --> 00:26:29,086
feather of herself, she (light footfall) lands
onto her toes on the top of the wall.

479
00:26:29,086 --> 00:26:30,679
LIAM: She was light already.

480
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:31,589
MATT: I know.

481
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:32,431
LAURA: Pike?!

482
00:26:32,431 --> 00:26:33,378
ASHLEY: Hi!

483
00:26:33,378 --> 00:26:34,466
LAURA: Hi!

484
00:26:34,466 --> 00:26:36,268
MARISHA: Pike, did we die?

485
00:26:36,268 --> 00:26:38,222
ASHLEY: No, you're still alive.

486
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:41,862
LIAM: How did you get here? What are you doing
here? How did you get here?

487
00:26:41,862 --> 00:26:45,184
ASHLEY: Oh gosh. It's a long story. I don't know
if we can talk about it right now.

488
00:26:45,184 --> 00:26:46,954
(laughter)

489
00:26:46,954 --> 00:26:50,102
ASHLEY: Do we need to fight anything right now?

490
00:26:50,102 --> 00:26:51,967
LAURA: There are lots of skeletons!

491
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:57,733
MATT: Yeah. As you look down before you, and there
is a horde of skeletons that are right now about

492
00:26:57,733 --> 00:27:00,834
to crush the wall. You see two right now that are
lashing out. One reaches for your leg.

493
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:02,325
TALIESIN: I'm taking a shot.

494
00:27:02,325 --> 00:27:03,743
MATT: Okay, go for it.

495
00:27:03,743 --> 00:27:05,203
ASHLEY: Let's talk later.

496
00:27:05,203 --> 00:27:09,920
LAURA: Can I have Trinket lift me? Stand up on his
hind legs, and up against the wall

497
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,804
so I can climb up?

498
00:27:10,804 --> 00:27:11,978
TALIESIN: I Percy'd.

499
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:13,201
SAM: You broke the gun?

500
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:15,067
MARISHA: No, he critted.

501
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:17,235
TALIESIN: I didn't Wheaton, come on. I Percy'd.

502
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,122
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll damage.

503
00:27:19,122 --> 00:27:20,392
TALIESIN: That's a 20.

504
00:27:20,392 --> 00:27:23,299
MATT: Whoever sent in that d20.

505
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:25,747
SAM: It's weighted.

506
00:27:25,747 --> 00:27:33,954
TALIESIN: It must be. Oh, it's hollow! Nine. 15
points of damage.

507
00:27:33,954 --> 00:27:39,194
MATT: With the rocketing (blast) sound, the
Pepperbox fires, and the skeleton in front of you

508
00:27:39,194 --> 00:27:43,475
just explodes into splinters of bone, just...
being scattered amongst the crowd of skeletons

509
00:27:43,475 --> 00:27:46,922
behind it. However, the moment that that one is
gone, another one seems to already be crawling

510
00:27:46,922 --> 00:27:48,103
into its place.

511
00:27:48,103 --> 00:27:50,258
TALIESIN: Whatever you're going to do, do it!
I'm firing again.

512
00:27:50,311 --> 00:27:51,643
MATT: Okay, fire again.

513
00:27:51,643 --> 00:27:53,937
TALIESIN: 24.

514
00:27:53,937 --> 00:27:55,736
MATT: What is it, 24?

515
00:27:55,736 --> 00:27:58,024
TALIESIN: 24. 11 points of damage.

516
00:27:58,024 --> 00:28:02,306
MATT: 11 points of damage? (gunshot) It fires and
blasts off most of the skull on the skeleton, and

517
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:05,015
you can see its jaw hangs open, but it still
(skeletal hiss).

518
00:28:05,015 --> 00:28:14,090
TALIESIN: Firing one more time at it! That hit.
15, 27. Seven points of damage.

519
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:18,271
MATT: Okay, that one you clearly destroy the top
of its skull. The rest of it just crumples into

520
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:23,483
the pile and disperses amongst the chaos. The
horde, though, is now as almost like a wave.

521
00:28:23,483 --> 00:28:26,974
There's so much of it that's pushing up against
the wall and beginning to swell up to reach the

522
00:28:26,974 --> 00:28:32,465
top of the ten-foot wall. The flaming sphere rolls
over the top and slams down into the front of the

523
00:28:32,465 --> 00:28:35,126
group. As it hits and impacts, go ahead and roll
the damage.

524
00:28:35,126 --> 00:28:39,398
MARISHA: I cast it at 4th-level, so it's doing 5d6
right now.

525
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:41,047
MATT: All righty. And what's the--

526
00:28:41,047 --> 00:28:46,642
MARISHA: They have to make dexterity saving
throws.

527
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,190
MATT: Okay.

528
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:51,704
MARISHA: Oh, really?!

529
00:28:51,704 --> 00:28:52,922
TALIESIN: Wow.

530
00:28:52,922 --> 00:28:59,460
MATT: One, three, nine, 20. One. I'm doing general
rolls for this. It pushes through ten of them.

531
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:06,398
Seven of them are destroyed, the bone cinders and
burns, and then crumples into itself. A few of

532
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:09,792
them manage to push out of the way, kind of
(growls) watching as it rolls past. You can hear

533
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:14,203
this constant pattering of rain evaporating
against the flaming sphere (sizzling) as it pushes

534
00:29:14,203 --> 00:29:20,535
through, the mud boiling, left in its wake. As
that's happening, you get up to the top. Trinket

535
00:29:20,535 --> 00:29:21,785
pushes you up on the top.

536
00:29:21,785 --> 00:29:25,754
LAURA: Yeah. I want to shoot Lightning Arrow down
into the core of it that I can see, just a big

537
00:29:25,754 --> 00:29:26,874
group of them.

538
00:29:26,874 --> 00:29:28,672
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

539
00:29:28,672 --> 00:29:30,018
LAURA: Okay.

540
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,557
SAM: I want to go up there. Pike's up there!

541
00:29:33,557 --> 00:29:35,249
LAURA: 16?

542
00:29:35,249 --> 00:29:37,739
MATT: 16? 16 definitely hits, yeah.

543
00:29:37,739 --> 00:29:57,744
LAURA: Okay. And then that's-- sorry, 2d8. I can't
add. 4d8. There we go. 19.

544
00:29:57,744 --> 00:29:59,128
MATT: 19 damage?

545
00:29:59,128 --> 00:30:00,024
LAURA: Yeah.

546
00:30:00,024 --> 00:30:03,790
MATT: Okay, so the first one takes full damage,
(impact noise) explodes as the lightning arcs

547
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:08,173
through the air, the arrow hitting the central
skeleton. You see the light actually burst into

548
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:12,992
the back of its skull, causing this blueish-green
glow to shoot out of its eyes and mouth as it

549
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,236
explodes and detonates.

550
00:30:14,236 --> 00:30:15,645
LAURA: Everything within ten feet.

551
00:30:15,645 --> 00:30:18,904
MATT: Exactly. Ten feet total? That would be...
wow.

552
00:30:18,904 --> 00:30:20,348
TALIESIN: 16.

553
00:30:20,348 --> 00:30:28,176
MATT: Yeah. (laughs) General saves on this. I'm
rolling for shit.

554
00:30:28,176 --> 00:30:29,761
TALIESIN: Yeah, you are!

555
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:39,221
MATT: All right, so with that (blast) the shock
wave blasts outward, and you see skeletons being

556
00:30:39,221 --> 00:30:44,999
thrown-- pieces of skeletons. Arms and weapons and
pieces of shield and armor being flung in the air.

557
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:50,730
As you see 12 of them immediately disintegrate and
explode around it. In that moment, though, the

558
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:55,092
horde pushes again and fills that gap almost
instantly. You do see the end of it now, at this

559
00:30:55,092 --> 00:31:01,032
point. It looks to be probably a total of 65 left
in this section. Roll a perception check.

560
00:31:01,032 --> 00:31:09,814
LAURA: Aw, that looked like it was going to be
awesome. 11.

561
00:31:09,814 --> 00:31:13,311
MATT: 11? Okay. Don't worry about it.

562
00:31:13,311 --> 00:31:19,387
TRAVIS: I look at Scanlan and I say, go get her,
and I grab Scanlan by the back, and I throw him up

563
00:31:19,387 --> 00:31:20,414
onto the wall.

564
00:31:20,414 --> 00:31:21,557
MATT: All right.

565
00:31:21,557 --> 00:31:22,683
MARISHA: Cheerleader boost.

566
00:31:22,683 --> 00:31:26,110
MATT: That's easy enough for a ten-foot wall, oh,
and for a gnome, so with that, Scanlan leaps up,

567
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,688
and you land next to Pike.

568
00:31:27,688 --> 00:31:37,165
SAM: Hi, baby! It's been so long. Man, you look
good. Aw, man, I'm so distracted by your beauty.

569
00:31:37,165 --> 00:31:39,933
Hey, let's kick some ass together, shall we?

570
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:41,732
ASHLEY: Kick some ass! Come on, let's go!

571
00:31:41,732 --> 00:31:45,224
MATT: And with that, both Scanlan and Pike, what
do you guys want to do?

572
00:31:45,224 --> 00:31:47,050
SAM: Ladies first.

573
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:50,708
ASHLEY: Can I jump off of the wall?

574
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,270
MATT: You can.

575
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,781
LAURA: Into the group?!

576
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:55,286
MATT: You can, yeah.

577
00:31:55,286 --> 00:32:03,848
ASHLEY: Yeah. I can? Okay. I want to try... I want
to see what happens if I cast Turn Undead.

578
00:32:03,848 --> 00:32:06,250
MATT: Or Destroy Undead. You have access to both.

579
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:10,237
ASHLEY: Oh man. Okay.

580
00:32:10,237 --> 00:32:12,452
MATT: It's a 30-foot radius.

581
00:32:12,452 --> 00:32:15,857
ASHLEY: Let's do it. I want to see it. I want to
see what it does.

582
00:32:15,857 --> 00:32:18,825
MATT: All right, so I need you to go ahead and
make an athletics check to see how far you can

583
00:32:18,825 --> 00:32:21,027
jump, if you don't mind.

584
00:32:21,027 --> 00:32:23,288
ASHLEY: What check was it?

585
00:32:23,288 --> 00:32:25,174
MATT, LAURA, AND TRAVIS: Athletics.

586
00:32:25,174 --> 00:32:29,105
MARISHA: This is going to be so badass. So
badass.

587
00:32:29,105 --> 00:32:31,152
LAURA: Don't jinx it. Don't jinx it.

588
00:32:31,152 --> 00:32:33,373
ASHLEY: What do I roll, again?

589
00:32:33,373 --> 00:32:34,806
MATT: Rolling athletics.

590
00:32:34,806 --> 00:32:36,943
LAURA: A 20 and then add your athletics.

591
00:32:36,943 --> 00:32:43,210
ASHLEY: I rolled a seven.

592
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:45,796
MATT: (laughs) And what's your athletics?

593
00:32:45,796 --> 00:32:50,107
LIAM: Can I pick her up by the armor and throw
her?

594
00:32:50,107 --> 00:32:57,239
MATT: (laughs) It's a little late for that,
unfortunately. What's your total?

595
00:32:57,239 --> 00:33:00,384
ASHLEY: Okay, hold on.

596
00:33:00,384 --> 00:33:02,787
MATT: Okay, just get in the swing of it, first.

597
00:33:02,787 --> 00:33:07,100
ASHLEY: I'm so sorry, you guys. I roll a 20? And I
rolled a ten. I rolled a ten. Hold on.

598
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,334
MATT: It's all good.

599
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:09,704
ASHLEY: Natural 20!

600
00:33:09,704 --> 00:33:10,851
LAURA: Oh!

601
00:33:10,851 --> 00:33:12,266
SAM: Hey, what is she rolling, huh?

602
00:33:12,266 --> 00:33:15,148
MARISHA: She accidentally rolled a d10, so she was
re-rolling for a d20,

603
00:33:15,148 --> 00:33:16,977
and she rolled a natural 20.

604
00:33:16,977 --> 00:33:19,341
MATT: That's pretty fantastic.

605
00:33:19,341 --> 00:33:20,596
TALIESIN: Thank you for the translation.

606
00:33:20,596 --> 00:33:22,027
MARISHA: Yes. Oh yay!

607
00:33:22,027 --> 00:33:33,928
MATT: Okay, then. Given that circumstance, you in
this sunny, radiant form, you reach back and leap

608
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:37,320
into the air, and for a split second you see with
a flash of light, almost like these momentary

609
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:44,160
feather angel wings, burst out of the shoulders of
Pike that (whoosh) flap once and then disperse

610
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:51,777
into sparkling feathers that vanish under the
rain. As Pike leaps out, landing 35 feet in the

611
00:33:51,777 --> 00:33:56,637
center of this on top of a skeleton. You slide
down its body as its shield pushes you off to the

612
00:33:56,637 --> 00:34:00,702
ground, and you land on your feet, and as far as
you can tell from your eye-line, all you see are

613
00:34:00,702 --> 00:34:06,023
chattering skulls and blades around you for all
visual perspectives and a little bit of the

614
00:34:06,023 --> 00:34:11,113
skyline above you, a little bit of the clouded
night sky. So Pike, are you going to use your

615
00:34:11,113 --> 00:34:13,570
action to Destroy Undead?

616
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,869
ASHLEY: Yeah!

617
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:18,159
(laughter)

618
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,085
MATT: Okay. Wow.

619
00:34:22,085 --> 00:34:24,331
MARISHA: Come on, Pike.

620
00:34:24,331 --> 00:34:26,205
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

621
00:34:26,205 --> 00:34:31,344
MATT: What's your spell DC? Be on your spell
page.

622
00:34:31,344 --> 00:34:34,721
ASHLEY: It is 16.

623
00:34:34,721 --> 00:34:39,231
MATT: 16? Good to know. That's wisdom. They're
minus one wisdom.

624
00:34:39,231 --> 00:34:49,121
MARISHA: There's, like, 80 skeletons he has to
roll for.

625
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:52,105
LAURA: Yeah, he's rolling a gajillion times,
Ashley.

626
00:34:52,105 --> 00:34:53,201
TALIESIN: Roll.

627
00:34:53,201 --> 00:34:55,419
LAURA: Oh, goodness.

628
00:34:55,419 --> 00:34:57,268
ASHLEY: I just keep hearing a thud.

629
00:34:57,268 --> 00:34:58,112
LAURA: Yeah.

630
00:34:58,112 --> 00:34:59,429
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

631
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:00,634
ASHLEY: Thunk.

632
00:35:00,634 --> 00:35:03,152
LIAM: It's going to be like a knife through
butter.

633
00:35:03,152 --> 00:35:04,962
LAURA: I can't believe he's rolling this many
times.

634
00:35:04,962 --> 00:35:06,571
MARISHA: I know.

635
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:09,562
(laughter)

636
00:35:09,562 --> 00:35:15,826
MATT: Okay. So, as you see all the skeletons begin
to reach for you, and their blades come pulling

637
00:35:15,826 --> 00:35:22,682
down towards your armor, you curl into a ball,
clutch your holy symbol of Sarenrae, and through

638
00:35:22,743 --> 00:35:27,124
the connection that has allowed you to be here in
this moment, you feel this welling of radiant

639
00:35:27,124 --> 00:35:34,110
energy just burst out from you in this shock wave
of glowing radiant force just (explosion noise)

640
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:44,952
blast outward. For that entire blast wave radius,
which would be the entirety of this road leading

641
00:35:44,952 --> 00:35:52,935
back for about 60 feet, you end up turning to ash
roughly 36 of these skeletons.

642
00:35:52,935 --> 00:35:54,611
ALL: Whoa!

643
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,078
ASHLEY: What?!

644
00:35:56,078 --> 00:35:57,933
(laughter)

645
00:35:57,933 --> 00:36:03,373
MATT: Just (explosion noise) the rain itself is
disintegrated by the sudden wave of heat, and

646
00:36:03,373 --> 00:36:08,526
there is just a cloud of ash that turns to mud
immediately against the rain and slams against the

647
00:36:08,526 --> 00:36:13,899
nearby buildings, slowly dripping down the sides.
Pieces of metal armor just go slamming to the

648
00:36:13,899 --> 00:36:17,836
ground, rolling (clanking) into piles and piles of
currently unused weapons.

649
00:36:17,836 --> 00:36:20,273
LAURA: Our jaws are just--

650
00:36:20,273 --> 00:36:21,880
LIAM: Yeah.

651
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,924
MATT: As you look up, you can see the remainder of
the horde, which you're looking at probably about

652
00:36:24,924 --> 00:36:30,585
at this point 20 or so skeletons still pushing
forward at this point, just mindlessly rushing

653
00:36:30,585 --> 00:36:33,485
towards the closest thing they can see, which is
this glowing beacon of a gnome in the center of

654
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:34,682
the street.

655
00:36:34,682 --> 00:36:36,065
LAURA: Oh my god.

656
00:36:36,065 --> 00:36:38,746
MATT: All right, so Scanlan, what do you want to
do?

657
00:36:38,746 --> 00:36:43,113
SAM: By the way, can I just say, that's my
girlfriend who just did that.

658
00:36:43,113 --> 00:36:45,460
(laughter)

659
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:53,015
SAM: I have to go to her aid. How close are the
skeletons that are approaching her right now?

660
00:36:53,015 --> 00:36:58,826
MATT: They're going to be acting after this, so
they're about 30 feet away from her, so just

661
00:36:58,826 --> 00:37:00,784
outside of the radius of her spell.

662
00:37:00,784 --> 00:37:05,554
SAM: Okay. I'm going to-- she jumped 35 feet out
there?

663
00:37:05,554 --> 00:37:06,759
MATT: She did, yes.

664
00:37:06,759 --> 00:37:08,046
SAM: Can I do that?

665
00:37:08,046 --> 00:37:09,146
MATT: If you want to try.

666
00:37:09,146 --> 00:37:10,163
MARISHA: She rolled a natural 20.

667
00:37:10,163 --> 00:37:11,432
LAURA: She rolled a natural 20.

668
00:37:11,432 --> 00:37:12,769
SAM: Jesus, that was hot.

669
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:15,152
ASHLEY: I can't believe I rolled a natural 20 on
my first roll.

670
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:16,506
LAURA: That is amazing.

671
00:37:16,506 --> 00:37:17,618
ASHLEY: So happy, you guys.

672
00:37:17,618 --> 00:37:19,032
SAM: Man.

673
00:37:19,032 --> 00:37:20,923
ASHLEY: It won't happen for the rest of the game.

674
00:37:20,923 --> 00:37:23,189
SAM: Yeah, I'm going to try to jump to her.

675
00:37:23,189 --> 00:37:24,732
(laughter)

676
00:37:24,732 --> 00:37:25,905
MATT: Okay.

677
00:37:25,905 --> 00:37:27,255
ASHLEY: Do it! Do it!

678
00:37:27,255 --> 00:37:29,955
SAM: Got to limber up first, stretch out the
calves.

679
00:37:29,955 --> 00:37:31,436
TALIESIN: This is going to go so poorly.

680
00:37:31,436 --> 00:37:33,897
LIAM: Natural 20 for love.

681
00:37:33,897 --> 00:37:37,504
SAM: For love? Yeah, four.

682
00:37:37,504 --> 00:37:40,851
(laughter)

683
00:37:40,851 --> 00:37:42,977
SAM: Is this acrobatics or athletics?

684
00:37:42,977 --> 00:37:44,078
MATT: It's athletics.

685
00:37:44,078 --> 00:37:46,225
SAM: Ooh, that's a nine.

686
00:37:46,225 --> 00:37:55,207
MATT: The wall itself is slick, and as you push
down, you lose your traction on the front. It

687
00:37:55,207 --> 00:38:01,718
doesn't cause you to fall, per se, but you manage
to get ten feet off the actual wall, landing

688
00:38:01,718 --> 00:38:07,161
(boof) with a thud in the dirt, and Pike still 25
feet away from you.

689
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:09,828
SAM: Okay, do I still have a move, or is that my
move?

690
00:38:09,828 --> 00:38:12,075
MATT: I'm going to say that's going to be your
move.

691
00:38:12,075 --> 00:38:17,475
SAM: Okay, shit. (laughs) How many are in my line
of sight?

692
00:38:17,475 --> 00:38:25,418
MATT: The 20 or so that are left are currently 55
feet from you and beyond.

693
00:38:25,418 --> 00:38:28,489
SAM: And are they clumped together by any chance?

694
00:38:28,489 --> 00:38:30,040
MATT: They are; they're very clumped together.

695
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,011
SAM: Oh, great.

696
00:38:31,011 --> 00:38:32,809
MATT: All their friends just turned to ash, and
they're now starting to climb over the armor to

697
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:34,297
find their way towards Pike.

698
00:38:34,297 --> 00:38:37,779
SAM: Okay, then I'm going to cast Lightning Bolt
on them. Will I hit Pike?

699
00:38:37,779 --> 00:38:39,474
Is she in my line of fire?

700
00:38:39,474 --> 00:38:42,038
MATT: Not if you angle it towards the edge.

701
00:38:42,038 --> 00:38:43,663
SAM: I will angle it, then.

702
00:38:43,663 --> 00:38:45,470
(laughter)

703
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,001
MATT: All right.

704
00:38:47,001 --> 00:38:50,816
SAM: Oh, and also, Lightning Bolt comes out of my
body?

705
00:38:50,816 --> 00:38:52,125
MATT: Out of your body in a straight line.

706
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:54,431
SAM: Can it come from my cock region?

707
00:38:54,431 --> 00:38:55,865
MATT: If you would like to.

708
00:38:55,865 --> 00:39:01,436
SAM: I would like it to just spew forth out of my
gonads, just at them.

709
00:39:01,436 --> 00:39:03,778
LAURA: Of course you do.

710
00:39:03,778 --> 00:39:07,693
SAM: I'm trying to impress Pike! I've got a
lightning dick!

711
00:39:07,693 --> 00:39:14,364
MATT: An arcane display of virility, if ever there
was one. Scanlan does a singular, classic, ancient

712
00:39:14,364 --> 00:39:20,623
technique, the arcane thrust, and with such
(boosh) a bolt of energy goes firing out just

713
00:39:20,623 --> 00:39:27,154
barely arcing around Pike's form and slamming into
a row of skeletons. Go ahead and roll your 8d6,

714
00:39:27,154 --> 00:39:31,415
and what's the DC on your spell? I will say
because you're doing the thrust, you do not get

715
00:39:31,415 --> 00:39:32,745
the cone on this one.

716
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,964
SAM: Oh, well it's not a-- it's 17.

717
00:39:34,964 --> 00:39:35,993
MATT: 17.

718
00:39:35,993 --> 00:39:37,644
LAURA: (laughs) He just put the cone down in a
lower place.

719
00:39:37,644 --> 00:39:39,601
LIAM: There's no 1d6 for cube damage.

720
00:39:39,601 --> 00:39:41,224
(laughter)

721
00:39:41,224 --> 00:39:42,576
MATT: Not for skeletons.

722
00:39:42,576 --> 00:39:52,817
SAM: (counts quietly) No wait, that's 14, 16, 20,
22!

723
00:39:52,817 --> 00:40:01,319
MATT: 22? All right, so the bolt (electric spark)
arcs through and slams into seven of them. What

724
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:03,371
was the total damage there you said?

725
00:40:03,371 --> 00:40:04,175
SAM: I'm sorry?

726
00:40:04,175 --> 00:40:05,599
MATT: The total damage was?

727
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,219
SAM: 22.

728
00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:11,628
MATT: 22. Okay, yeah. So two of them survive. You
can see their kind of burnt, charred forms, and

729
00:40:11,628 --> 00:40:15,502
one of them's missing an arm now, and the armor
itself is still (electricity noise) arcing little

730
00:40:15,502 --> 00:40:20,524
bits of energy. Five of them, however, just
explode into black, burning bone chips.

731
00:40:20,524 --> 00:40:22,953
LAURA: Bone chips.

732
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:26,960
MATT: At which point you can now see, bolts of
lightning are (lightning strike) coming down from

733
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,419
the storm in the distance, too, as the
thunderstorm itself is reaching more of a fervored

734
00:40:31,419 --> 00:40:39,659
pace, the rain itself getting harder and harder on
you guys. So, with that, you can see looking over

735
00:40:39,735 --> 00:40:46,521
your shoulder on the other side of this wall
another bit of skeletal horde is starting to come

736
00:40:46,521 --> 00:40:49,152
down one of the nearby intersections, and it's
starting to come around

737
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,531
the other side of you guys.

738
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,862
LAURA: Oh, we're getting trapped.

739
00:40:51,862 --> 00:40:53,546
TRAVIS: Oh, shock. We should have fucking run.

740
00:40:53,546 --> 00:40:59,514
MATT: You do see, however, that the ten villagers
and Keeper Yennan are currently rushing towards

741
00:40:59,514 --> 00:41:04,717
that group to hold them at bay and Keeper looks
back over his shoulder and says, "You! Don't

742
00:41:04,717 --> 00:41:11,211
"worry! We've got this! You do what you must. It
has begun. Finish it!" And goes charging forward,

743
00:41:11,211 --> 00:41:16,502
holding his shield forward, rushing towards the
group of skeletons. The skeletons, however-- you

744
00:41:16,502 --> 00:41:18,764
have to do something at this point.

745
00:41:18,764 --> 00:41:20,112
LIAM: I'm going to hold my turn.

746
00:41:20,112 --> 00:41:26,279
MATT: Hold your turn? Okay. The remaining 13 or so
skeletons use their full movement to get up, only

747
00:41:26,279 --> 00:41:32,486
three of which can actually get into combat range
with Pike, since their speed is only 30. That

748
00:41:32,486 --> 00:41:34,682
radius really messed them up, man.

749
00:41:34,682 --> 00:41:35,720
ASHLEY: Yeah!

750
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,894
MATT: Glad you could make it tonight.

751
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:37,943
(laughter)

752
00:41:37,943 --> 00:41:39,592
LIAM: Are they closing in on Pike?

753
00:41:39,592 --> 00:41:40,525
MATT: They are, yes.

754
00:41:40,525 --> 00:41:42,340
LIAM: Oh, then I'm going to leap off the wall and
run towards Pike.

755
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,935
MATT: Okay, so you'll get there simultaneously;
you'll be doing your action simultaneously. So,

756
00:41:45,935 --> 00:41:53,399
you run off the wall (running steps) and make it
up, not a problem at all with speed. Pike, as you

757
00:41:53,399 --> 00:41:58,473
see the rest of the skeletons zoning in on you,
Vax suddenly just rushes to your side, daggers at

758
00:41:58,473 --> 00:42:08,292
the ready. Three skeletons are going to take
swipes at Pike. That is a 17? Nope? Oh, it's a

759
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:15,610
seven. Oh, skeletons. And that is a 12. Yeah.
Two of them try and swipe, and you just knock it

760
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:19,713
out of the way with your shield. A third one does
hit you in the front of the chest, but the armor

761
00:42:19,713 --> 00:42:23,202
deflects it entirely, and the blade actually sinks
a little bit into your form, but the radiant

762
00:42:23,326 --> 00:42:27,396
energy that holds your position there just pushes
it off, and the blade itself seems to almost dull

763
00:42:27,396 --> 00:42:28,884
from the impact.

764
00:42:28,884 --> 00:42:30,654
TALIESIN: Up yours, Harryhausen!

765
00:42:30,654 --> 00:42:32,228
MATT: You're up.

766
00:42:32,228 --> 00:42:34,559
LIAM: How many skeletons are in range right now?

767
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:39,957
MATT: Well, the final seven that are currently
there are within range if you wish to attack any

768
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:42,987
of them. There are three that are currently in
melee with her.

769
00:42:42,987 --> 00:42:47,405
LIAM: I'm going to take my blades and spin around,
pommel out, and I'm going to start punching. I

770
00:42:47,405 --> 00:42:52,381
have no idea if this will do anything. There is a
symbol of Sarenrae sewn into this glove right

771
00:42:52,381 --> 00:42:55,671
here. I'm just going to start-- I don't have the
Boots of Haste on, so I can

772
00:42:55,671 --> 00:42:57,589
just take two swings at--

773
00:42:57,589 --> 00:42:58,686
SAM: Punching?

774
00:42:58,686 --> 00:43:02,811
LIAM: Yeah. Two skeletons. One skeleton. Whatever
skeleton is closest to Pike.

775
00:43:02,811 --> 00:43:04,678
MATT: There's a skeleton right next to both you
and Pike.

776
00:43:04,678 --> 00:43:07,076
LIAM: Yeah, all right. He's getting it in the
dusty jaw.

777
00:43:07,076 --> 00:43:08,264
MATT: Go for it.

778
00:43:08,264 --> 00:43:12,235
LIAM: All right, I have no idea how to do this.
I've never done anything without a dagger. That's

779
00:43:12,235 --> 00:43:16,760
not good. I don't know what to add to this.

780
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,066
LAURA: You still get sneak attack if you're in
back of them.

781
00:43:19,066 --> 00:43:20,818
LIAM: That's true, but I have to hit.

782
00:43:20,818 --> 00:43:22,162
(laughter)

783
00:43:22,162 --> 00:43:29,304
MATT: So, if you're just physically punching, this
is strength-based. So roll a d20. Add your

784
00:43:29,304 --> 00:43:32,543
strength modifier and your proficiency-- although
it's unarmed strike, so I don't know if you're

785
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:33,585
proficient with unarmed strikes...

786
00:43:33,585 --> 00:43:35,433
LIAM: No, that's fine. so the first one misses
entirely.

787
00:43:35,433 --> 00:43:36,324
MATT: Okay.

788
00:43:36,324 --> 00:43:42,295
LIAM: And the second one is-- oh, this is probably
fine for skeletons. 12, 13, 14.

789
00:43:42,295 --> 00:43:44,442
MATT: What did you roll on the dice?

790
00:43:44,442 --> 00:43:45,832
LIAM: 11.

791
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,032
MATT: Yeah, you hit.

792
00:43:47,032 --> 00:43:50,411
LIAM: Okay, that's the right hand with the
symbol.

793
00:43:50,411 --> 00:43:54,410
MATT: The symbol of Sarenrae, okay. Go ahead and
roll 1d2 plus your strength modifier damage.

794
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,822
LAURA: 1d2? There's no 1d2.

795
00:43:56,822 --> 00:43:59,815
MATT: Roll a d4 and divide it by two.

796
00:43:59,815 --> 00:44:02,462
LIAM: It's a one, so it's a one.

797
00:44:02,462 --> 00:44:03,732
MATT: What's your modifier for strength?

798
00:44:03,732 --> 00:44:05,089
LIAM: Two, so it's a three.

799
00:44:05,089 --> 00:44:09,841
MATT: So you do three points of Vax fist damage
right to the skull (crushing sound).

800
00:44:09,841 --> 00:44:11,959
SAM: She killed 36 of them!

801
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:19,005
MATT: It hurts at impact, and you feel like the
bone wobbled as the skull (bone ratchety noise)

802
00:44:19,005 --> 00:44:21,473
back towards you.

803
00:44:21,651 --> 00:44:26,458
LIAM: This symbol does nothing for me. I'm here to
soak up damage for you, Pike. Let them hit me in

804
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:27,598
the face.

805
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:28,936
TALIESIN: It looks great.

806
00:44:28,936 --> 00:44:30,681
MARISHA: Good craftsmanship.

807
00:44:30,681 --> 00:44:32,382
MATT: But well done, that was a fun round.

808
00:44:32,382 --> 00:44:34,869
LIAM: That was a test. It's better now than
against Sylas Briarwood.

809
00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:36,426
MATT: (laughs) True enough.

810
00:44:36,426 --> 00:44:38,787
TRAVIS: Can I make it around the wall?

811
00:44:38,787 --> 00:44:43,741
MATT: If you want to make an athletics check to
leap up and use that to jump off, you-- mister

812
00:44:43,741 --> 00:44:47,862
athletic movement and high speed.

813
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:49,120
TRAVIS: 19?

814
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,496
MATT: Rolled a 19?

815
00:44:50,496 --> 00:44:51,644
TRAVIS: 12 and seven.

816
00:44:51,644 --> 00:44:54,852
MATT: I'll say you leap up on the wall, use that
as kind of a stepping point, and jump as far as

817
00:44:54,852 --> 00:45:01,244
you can. You get 20 feet forward beyond the wall
(heavy landing) land with your hammer to your

818
00:45:01,244 --> 00:45:08,509
side, (flames ignite), flames flickering off the
edge of it. You still have-- I'd give you 20 more

819
00:45:08,509 --> 00:45:11,058
feet of movement at this point because you're a
crazy-fast barbarian.

820
00:45:11,058 --> 00:45:12,462
TRAVIS: Can I reach them?

821
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:15,336
MATT: You'd be able to reach two of them, right on
the other side of Pike.

822
00:45:15,336 --> 00:45:19,220
TRAVIS: "Tee time!" And I rush up with the war
hammer and swing.

823
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,568
MATT: Okay, go for it.

824
00:45:20,568 --> 00:45:21,681
MARISHA: Tea time?

825
00:45:21,681 --> 00:45:25,253
LAURA: Tee time. I was picturing tea; he probably
meant golf.

826
00:45:25,304 --> 00:45:26,702
TRAVIS: Like Happy Gilmore.

827
00:45:26,702 --> 00:45:29,241
TALIESIN: Fist full of crumpets.

828
00:45:29,241 --> 00:45:31,494
TRAVIS: Tea time. That's a 26.

829
00:45:31,494 --> 00:45:37,450
MATT: 26, that definitely hits. Roll for damage on
the first one.

830
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:39,033
TRAVIS: Okay, I don't know...

831
00:45:39,033 --> 00:45:41,196
TALIESIN: Mister Cobblemitts, I do declare.

832
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:43,748
SAM: Get your doilies out.

833
00:45:43,748 --> 00:45:47,844
TRAVIS: Okay, 11. 12?

834
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:52,884
MATT: 12 damage? How much is the war hammer? Of
that? Not the fire damage.

835
00:45:52,884 --> 00:45:54,132
TRAVIS: Oh, just 11.

836
00:45:54,132 --> 00:46:01,100
MATT: 11? Okay. As you smack into it, you can see the
bones themselves are brittle by nature, but the

837
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:09,378
solid slamming force of a thick piece of honed
metal into the side of this bone-brittle creature

838
00:46:09,378 --> 00:46:14,394
just sends it shattering to the side. You get the
feeling that these entities are particularly

839
00:46:14,394 --> 00:46:19,743
fragile against bludgeoning weapons. So your first
strike just scatters one of the skeletons across

840
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:23,102
the ground. You have one more in your reach if you
want to go for your second attack.

841
00:46:23,102 --> 00:46:24,017
TRAVIS: Yeah.

842
00:46:24,017 --> 00:46:26,430
MATT: Okay.

843
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:27,745
TRAVIS: 20.

844
00:46:27,745 --> 00:46:30,911
MATT: 20. Go ahead and roll damage on that one.

845
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:40,359
TRAVIS: (laughs) 16. 22.

846
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:44,028
MATT: (explosion noise) The second one just
explodes up into the air. You can see one of its

847
00:46:44,028 --> 00:46:46,775
shields goes flying off and lands on one of the
roofs, almost like Walter White's pizza.

848
00:46:46,775 --> 00:46:48,119
MARISHA: I dodge a femur.

849
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:52,258
ASHLEY: I give Grog an air-high-five.

850
00:46:52,258 --> 00:46:57,916
MATT: As great weapon master, I believe if you
kill something, you also can use a bonus action to

851
00:46:57,916 --> 00:47:03,634
get a third attack. Outside of your frenzied rage.
So, I mean, nothing's in-- right now in melee range

852
00:47:03,706 --> 00:47:06,192
for you, but if you wanted to throw your hammer,
you could.

853
00:47:06,192 --> 00:47:07,638
TRAVIS: I'm also not raging.

854
00:47:07,638 --> 00:47:11,038
MATT: Correct. I'm saying, as part of great weapon
master, you can not rage, kill something, and then

855
00:47:11,038 --> 00:47:12,551
get a free attack with your weapon.

856
00:47:12,551 --> 00:47:14,480
TRAVIS: Well let's throw some shit, then.

857
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,402
MATT: (laughs) So with the Chain of Returning
attached to your hammer, you go ahead and

858
00:47:17,402 --> 00:47:21,384
(propeller noise) send it swinging towards one of
the further skeletons.

859
00:47:21,384 --> 00:47:22,784
TRAVIS: 25.

860
00:47:22,784 --> 00:47:25,144
MATT: 25 definitely hits. Go ahead and roll
damage.

861
00:47:25,144 --> 00:47:34,144
TRAVIS: Ten... 14.

862
00:47:34,144 --> 00:47:39,465
MATT: 14, doubled due to the bludgeoning
vulnerability on the initial impact. The hammer

863
00:47:39,465 --> 00:47:45,867
slams into its rib cage, causing it to cave
inward. Its entire upper body just falls into

864
00:47:45,867 --> 00:47:51,045
itself as the hammer, not meeting any resistance,
goes beyond and (impact) splotches into the mud.

865
00:47:51,045 --> 00:47:54,305
Go ahead and make your athletics check to try and
pull the hammer back.

866
00:47:54,305 --> 00:47:56,632
LIAM: Like you're attacking ribbon candy.

867
00:47:56,632 --> 00:47:58,083
MATT: Kind of, technically.

868
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,066
TRAVIS: 13.

869
00:47:59,066 --> 00:48:04,414
MATT: 13. You just (sucking noise) pull it out
with a sickening sound (thunk) catch it in the

870
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:08,608
air, the blood dripping-- the mud dripping off of
it, but you see it burning away as the flames

871
00:48:08,608 --> 00:48:11,594
begin to burst through the actual mud.

872
00:48:11,594 --> 00:48:12,890
LAURA: You're licking the mud off?

873
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,907
TRAVIS: Yeah. Never know a place until you lick
the mud.

874
00:48:15,907 --> 00:48:19,224
MATT: Burns some of the taste buds as the searing
hot edge of of the hammer reaches your tongue.

875
00:48:19,224 --> 00:48:21,498
TRAVIS: (pained noises)

876
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:33,360
MATT: All right, that ends that round. There are
now currently four skeletons on this side. We'll

877
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,537
say for the sake of brevity, you manage to, in the
next round or so, just destroy them, the flaming

878
00:48:36,537 --> 00:48:42,379
sphere itself can just bash through them. So
you're on two sides of the wall. The rain's

879
00:48:42,379 --> 00:48:46,290
pouring so heavily (lightning crash). There's a
flash in the distance of lightning. I want

880
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,105
everyone to roll perception.

881
00:48:48,105 --> 00:48:49,608
TRAVIS: Now I know what we're looking for.

882
00:48:49,608 --> 00:48:51,050
TALIESIN: Have to have a conversation soon.

883
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:53,198
MARISHA: Have to have a conversation. Oh, fuck.

884
00:48:53,198 --> 00:48:53,843
SAM: 16.

885
00:48:53,843 --> 00:48:54,856
TRAVIS: Two.

886
00:48:54,856 --> 00:48:56,129
LIAM: 20.

887
00:48:56,129 --> 00:48:57,001
TALIESIN: 17.

888
00:48:57,001 --> 00:48:58,060
LAURA: 19.

889
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,218
MARISHA: One.

890
00:48:59,218 --> 00:49:04,203
MATT: So you got 20? You see in the flash of
lightning in the distance. You can see just barely

891
00:49:04,203 --> 00:49:11,578
on the other side of the town square what looks
like the outline of a giant currently slamming

892
00:49:11,578 --> 00:49:15,720
into something, and out of the corner of your eye,
you see a second one to the south side of the

893
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:21,396
city. There are still a few of these giant
sentinels out there. They don't look too terribly

894
00:49:21,396 --> 00:49:23,582
close, but they're still on the rampage.

895
00:49:23,582 --> 00:49:24,946
LAURA: Should get out of here.

896
00:49:24,946 --> 00:49:26,186
SAM: Or kill them.

897
00:49:26,186 --> 00:49:27,084
TRAVIS: Or kill them.

898
00:49:27,084 --> 00:49:28,554
LAURA: That's a lot of giants to take on.

899
00:49:28,554 --> 00:49:29,574
SAM: There's two.

900
00:49:29,574 --> 00:49:36,121
LIAM: We need to go kill those giants right now.
We have a holy gnome right now. I don't know how

901
00:49:36,121 --> 00:49:40,975
you came to us Pike. We need to go to them, and
then we need to go to the Briarwoods now. Now.

902
00:49:40,975 --> 00:49:45,347
LAURA: I'm out of spells! We can't go to the
Briarwoods now. I am out of spells.

903
00:49:45,347 --> 00:49:47,039
LIAM: Granted, we're going to the giants now.

904
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:48,612
MARISHA: I don't think we have a choice.

905
00:49:48,612 --> 00:49:49,552
LIAM: Giants now.

906
00:49:49,552 --> 00:49:51,497
SAM: Giants. Let's go get the giants.

907
00:49:51,551 --> 00:49:54,487
TALIESIN: Yennan! Can you hold until morning?

908
00:49:54,487 --> 00:50:00,105
MATT: As you're shouting this over, he is
currently about 40 feet away right now, slamming

909
00:50:00,105 --> 00:50:03,605
into a front line of skeletons, grabbing his own
holy symbol, and you see another similar burst of

910
00:50:03,605 --> 00:50:09,284
energy to the one that Pike let out earlier.
(explosion) That same dull, bass-y impact sound.

911
00:50:09,284 --> 00:50:13,446
You feel a shudder in the ground beneath you as a
series of more skeletons are immediately

912
00:50:13,446 --> 00:50:20,506
disintegrated in his proximity. Looks over his
shoulder. "Until morning? Why wait until morning?

913
00:50:20,506 --> 00:50:22,129
"We're fighting now!"

914
00:50:22,129 --> 00:50:23,902
TALIESIN: We'll do what we can.

915
00:50:23,902 --> 00:50:25,695
SAM: Hold that thought.

916
00:50:25,695 --> 00:50:29,214
TRAVIS: I'll go.

917
00:50:29,214 --> 00:50:30,818
LIAM: Giants, now.

918
00:50:30,818 --> 00:50:32,321
SAM: Giants, yes.

919
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:34,016
LAURA: I can shoot an arrow.

920
00:50:34,016 --> 00:50:39,352
LIAM: Better than the Briarwoods plus giants;
let's go get those giants right now.

921
00:50:39,352 --> 00:50:42,837
SAM: Are the two giants together or are they
coming from opposite sides?

922
00:50:42,837 --> 00:50:45,332
LIAM: No, there's one over there, and there's one
off in that direction.

923
00:50:45,332 --> 00:50:46,879
MATT: One to the east, one to the south.

924
00:50:46,879 --> 00:50:47,872
SAM: Let's split the party.

925
00:50:47,872 --> 00:50:51,238
MARISHA: Split the party! I say we do it; fuck it,
let's split the party.

926
00:50:51,238 --> 00:50:53,756
One take east, one take west.

927
00:50:53,756 --> 00:50:57,076
LIAM: All right, weight it more heavily to the
group that does not have Pike.

928
00:50:57,076 --> 00:50:58,573
LAURA: Yeah.

929
00:50:58,573 --> 00:51:00,633
MATT: Okay. Who's taking whom?

930
00:51:00,633 --> 00:51:01,892
SAM: Oh, I'm with Pike.

931
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,923
(laughter)

932
00:51:03,923 --> 00:51:12,487
MARISHA: Spellcasters should split up. I'll go
without-- what did you just say?

933
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:18,135
LAURA: I said Percy, you, me, and Vax go on one,
and then these three go on another.

934
00:51:18,135 --> 00:51:19,351
ALL: Yes.

935
00:51:19,351 --> 00:51:22,359
TRAVIS: I'll take the gnomes on my shoulders.

936
00:51:22,359 --> 00:51:23,926
(laughter)

937
00:51:23,926 --> 00:51:26,181
LIAM: Ah, it's adorable.

938
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:27,969
TALIESIN: Give you a big hug.

939
00:51:28,022 --> 00:51:31,004
MATT: All right, so we have Grog and the two
gnomes, and the rest of you?

940
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,702
MARISHA: Hey, we started something; we can't
stop.

941
00:51:32,702 --> 00:51:33,891
MATT: Who's going which direction?

942
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:35,831
TRAVIS: Grog and the two gnomes will run south.

943
00:51:35,831 --> 00:51:37,218
LIAM: Are they to the south and west?

944
00:51:37,218 --> 00:51:38,944
MATT: Currently to the south and east.

945
00:51:38,944 --> 00:51:41,130
LAURA: Why are we splitting? This is the stupidest!

946
00:51:41,186 --> 00:51:44,477
SAM: Everything we've done in this fight is the
stupidest. Let's go.

947
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:45,446
MARISHA: Let's go!

948
00:51:45,446 --> 00:51:47,931
SAM: All right, big and smalls are going south.

949
00:51:47,931 --> 00:51:49,299
TALIESIN: We meet to the west!

950
00:51:49,299 --> 00:51:50,363
MARISHA: We'll go east.

951
00:51:50,363 --> 00:51:53,804
TALIESIN: We're going east, but we meet to the
west when we're finished.

952
00:51:53,804 --> 00:51:54,982
TRAVIS: The treeline.

953
00:51:54,982 --> 00:51:57,347
TALIESIN: Listen to your ears.

954
00:51:57,347 --> 00:51:59,755
MARISHA: Although remember, the signal's a little
weak.

955
00:51:59,755 --> 00:52:03,301
TALIESIN: Once we get back to the western wall,
we'll be able to hear each other.

956
00:52:03,301 --> 00:52:04,295
MATT: All right.

957
00:52:04,295 --> 00:52:05,644
TALIESIN: Oh god.

958
00:52:05,644 --> 00:52:13,002
MATT: Grog and gnomes, you guys are going to the
south, all right. As you guys dart off, making

959
00:52:13,002 --> 00:52:19,521
your way around the still very ominous and creepy
Sun Tree to your left, you can see all the various

960
00:52:19,521 --> 00:52:24,213
muddy prints of all the scraping skeletons that
came through here, and in the distance you can

961
00:52:24,213 --> 00:52:30,072
still hear echoing shouts, combat shouts, commands
being sent throughout. There's still very much an

962
00:52:30,072 --> 00:52:34,778
aggressive presence of the resistance in this
city. You have no idea whether or not it's on the

963
00:52:34,778 --> 00:52:40,168
winning or losing side at this moment, but it is
still active. You guys divide at this point.

964
00:52:40,168 --> 00:52:44,296
Starting with you guys. Grog, holding both the
gnomes, and you can feel Pike is lighter than

965
00:52:44,296 --> 00:52:47,127
normal, and you know her weight quite well, as
you're used to putting her up on your shoulders

966
00:52:47,127 --> 00:52:55,383
from growing up with her, and in recent years. But
there's also this strange kind of vibration to her

967
00:52:55,383 --> 00:52:58,734
body, like it's not physically there, but yet it
does feel like there is physical presence.

968
00:52:58,734 --> 00:53:03,350
As you're rushing through the rain, acknowledging
this, you make your way to the bottom of the

969
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:08,523
square. Charging through, you almost slip at one
point and catch yourself, head past one street, a

970
00:53:08,523 --> 00:53:13,086
second street, and to the left as you glance off,
you can see there is another patch of skeletons

971
00:53:13,086 --> 00:53:19,957
and currently about five villagers that are just
trying to tear through them. You see a couple of

972
00:53:19,957 --> 00:53:24,295
bodies of villagers that have recently been
killed. There's one that's actually still

973
00:53:24,295 --> 00:53:27,574
partially alive on the ground. It's like dragging
itself through the mud in your direction, like

974
00:53:27,574 --> 00:53:33,834
(gasping, grunting) Rain pouring down, there's a
big trail of mud and blood currently behind him as

975
00:53:33,834 --> 00:53:38,757
he's making his way towards you guys. (gasp)
"Help!" What are you doing, Grog?

976
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:40,964
TRAVIS: Pike, do you want to help him?

977
00:53:40,964 --> 00:53:44,120
ASHLEY: What did you say it was?

978
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,575
LIAM: There's a person wounded, pulling themselves
through the mud, saying, "Help me."

979
00:53:47,575 --> 00:53:52,447
ASHLEY: Yeah, I do. I always want to help
somebody. I don't know; what do you think?

980
00:53:52,447 --> 00:53:54,281
SAM: Yeah, let's do it. Let's help him.

981
00:53:54,281 --> 00:53:55,186
ASHLEY: Okay.

982
00:53:55,186 --> 00:53:56,649
TRAVIS: All right, we stop and let Pike down.

983
00:53:56,649 --> 00:53:59,389
MATT: Okay, so you rush up to this guy. As you get
up to him, you see his face is half-covered in

984
00:53:59,389 --> 00:54:04,039
blood; his side is very heavily wounded. It looks
like he took some sort of a spear wound that then

985
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:08,973
tore through his midsection. He has been bleeding
out pretty heavily at this point and probably

986
00:54:08,973 --> 00:54:13,146
doesn't have much longer to him. As you bring Pike
down below him, Pike, what are you going to do?

987
00:54:13,146 --> 00:54:14,885
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll Cure Wounds.

988
00:54:14,885 --> 00:54:16,432
MATT: What level?

989
00:54:16,432 --> 00:54:18,130
ASHLEY: I'll do 3rd.

990
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:21,037
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and roll for that.

991
00:54:21,037 --> 00:54:22,247
SAM: She's the best.

992
00:54:22,247 --> 00:54:24,138
(laughter)

993
00:54:24,138 --> 00:54:27,850
SAM: Look at her, Grog. She's helping an innocent
bystander. She didn't have to!

994
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:29,997
TRAVIS: Going to step on his throat after she's
done.

995
00:54:30,064 --> 00:54:32,445
SAM: She just is a people person!

996
00:54:32,445 --> 00:54:35,535
MATT: All right, 3d8 plus five.

997
00:54:35,535 --> 00:54:40,979
ASHLEY: (garbled) 23.

998
00:54:41,051 --> 00:54:42,423
TRAVIS: 23?

999
00:54:42,423 --> 00:54:47,657
MATT: 23? Okay, so as you reach forward, he looks
up at you like he's seeing an angel walk towards

1000
00:54:47,727 --> 00:54:53,704
him and looks scared. He's like, "No, not yet. Not
yet!" And as you reach forward and touch the sides

1001
00:54:53,704 --> 00:55:00,213
of his face with your smile of mercy and
understanding, your warm hands touch the sides of

1002
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:05,079
his head, and the energy of Sarenrae's blessing
pours through his body. You can see the insides of

1003
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:08,757
his armor begin to give this soft glow from where
the wounds are as they close up. You can see the

1004
00:55:08,757 --> 00:55:13,238
large gash in his side begin to stitch itself up
magically, and at that point he takes a deep

1005
00:55:13,238 --> 00:55:17,389
breath for a second and kind of turns over and is
now in sitting position, breathing heavily,

1006
00:55:17,389 --> 00:55:24,851
looking around himself, confused. "You... you're
an angel. A bloody right angel."

1007
00:55:24,851 --> 00:55:27,866
ASHLEY: No, I'm not, I--

1008
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:32,893
MATT: He reaches out for you with his hand
forward. "Thank you."

1009
00:55:32,893 --> 00:55:34,891
ASHLEY: I help him up.

1010
00:55:34,891 --> 00:55:38,552
MATT: He gets up and he still seems sore and
bruised and there's still wounds across his body,

1011
00:55:38,552 --> 00:55:48,310
but he's no longer on the path to terminal loss of
his life. He stands up. "Okay. Okay. Thank you."

1012
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:49,810
TRAVIS: Run. Now.

1013
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:54,635
MATT: "Oh, I intend to." And he reaches over in
the mud and finds his sword, wipes it off from the

1014
00:55:54,635 --> 00:55:58,320
side, (war cry) turns around and rushes back in to
the rest of his allies.

1015
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,517
TRAVIS: I like him!

1016
00:55:59,517 --> 00:56:01,097
SAM: He's a good guy.

1017
00:56:01,097 --> 00:56:03,770
TRAVIS: I pick Pike back up, put her on my
shoulder, and we keep running.

1018
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:06,464
MATT: Okay, you guys go charging back into the
storm from the south side.

1019
00:56:06,464 --> 00:56:07,738
(Skype sound)

1020
00:56:07,738 --> 00:56:09,015
ALL: Oh no!

1021
00:56:09,015 --> 00:56:10,142
MATT: We've lost Pike!

1022
00:56:10,142 --> 00:56:11,337
LAURA: Oh no!

1023
00:56:11,337 --> 00:56:12,641
SAM: It's okay, it's okay.

1024
00:56:12,641 --> 00:56:13,912
LIAM: Keep telling the story.

1025
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,082
MARISHA: Oh god!

1026
00:56:15,082 --> 00:56:20,816
MATT: Technology. As you guys continue running
forward, you go past two city streets. The whole

1027
00:56:20,816 --> 00:56:23,766
city's dark now, it's closed down in
preparation for what this evening is going to

1028
00:56:23,825 --> 00:56:33,769
entail. So you go past these two streets to the
left. Immediately, you hear the familiar sound of

1029
00:56:33,769 --> 00:56:38,773
a large, heavy mass slamming into the ground, and
as soon as you turn the corner you can see there

1030
00:56:38,773 --> 00:56:46,511
are three people left in this one resistance
brigade. There is a pile of wounded and/or killed

1031
00:56:46,511 --> 00:56:51,465
soldiers around its feet, and it looks like it's
been nearly untouched. This one apparently got the

1032
00:56:51,465 --> 00:56:54,431
drop on them or at least they weren't fully
prepared for what they were up against, and it's

1033
00:56:54,431 --> 00:56:58,225
just swinging this giant club in the air around
towards them. They're all kind of keeping their

1034
00:56:58,225 --> 00:57:01,884
distance, not knowing if they should run or keep
fighting. As you just turn around the corner, I

1035
00:57:01,884 --> 00:57:04,293
want you guys to roll initiative.

1036
00:57:04,293 --> 00:57:05,974
SAM: Initiative, Ashley, initiative.

1037
00:57:05,974 --> 00:57:10,978
ASHLEY: Okay. Wait, I cut out right when you said,
was that guy bad?

1038
00:57:10,978 --> 00:57:12,975
SAM: No, he was a good guy. You did good, kid.

1039
00:57:12,975 --> 00:57:14,109
ASHLEY: Okay.

1040
00:57:14,109 --> 00:57:16,405
MARISHA: He picked up a sword and went running
back into battle.

1041
00:57:16,405 --> 00:57:17,754
LIAM: Back to the fight.

1042
00:57:17,754 --> 00:57:18,820
ASHLEY: Okay, good.

1043
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:19,844
TRAVIS: Boss.

1044
00:57:19,844 --> 00:57:21,301
SAM: 16 for me.

1045
00:57:21,301 --> 00:57:22,863
TRAVIS: Yes! Me too.

1046
00:57:22,863 --> 00:57:24,267
MATT: Fantastic.

1047
00:57:24,267 --> 00:57:25,638
SAM: We'll go last.

1048
00:57:25,638 --> 00:57:27,731
LIAM: Ooh, he's got houses.

1049
00:57:27,731 --> 00:57:34,716
LAURA: Oh, wow. This one is very, very rolly. What
did you get for initiative, Ashley?

1050
00:57:34,716 --> 00:57:36,369
ASHLEY: I got a six.

1051
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:37,401
LAURA: Aw.

1052
00:57:37,401 --> 00:57:39,448
SAM: She said six?

1053
00:57:39,448 --> 00:57:40,320
LAURA: Yeah.

1054
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,614
SAM: Aw.

1055
00:57:41,614 --> 00:57:42,976
MATT: Should be fine there.

1056
00:57:42,976 --> 00:57:44,443
MARISHA: Fine, fuck it.

1057
00:57:44,443 --> 00:57:45,784
LIAM: Oh, look at that!

1058
00:57:45,784 --> 00:57:51,461
LAURA: Whoa, he's huge! Grog is almost as big as
him. Almost.

1059
00:57:51,461 --> 00:57:56,297
MARISHA: You ready for this, Grog?

1060
00:57:56,297 --> 00:58:01,273
MATT: She is turned this way right now. They're
all keeping their distance at this point. All

1061
00:58:01,273 --> 00:58:04,475
right. So. Initiatives for that. Oh. All right.

1062
00:58:04,475 --> 00:58:06,734
LIAM: Blood of the giant, you can do this.

1063
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:08,854
MARISHA: Oh man, I'm so excited.

1064
00:58:08,904 --> 00:58:10,396
LAURA: Horrified.

1065
00:58:10,396 --> 00:58:12,272
MARISHA: Yeah, me too, a little horrified.

1066
00:58:12,272 --> 00:58:13,849
MATT: All right, so. Initiatives are?

1067
00:58:13,849 --> 00:58:15,155
SAM AND TRAVIS: 16.

1068
00:58:15,155 --> 00:58:16,708
SAM: Six for her.

1069
00:58:16,708 --> 00:58:17,978
MATT: All righty.

1070
00:58:17,978 --> 00:58:19,742
MARISHA: Does Trinket-- where's Trinket?

1071
00:58:19,742 --> 00:58:20,947
LAURA: I'm riding Trinket.

1072
00:58:20,947 --> 00:58:22,192
MARISHA: Oh, we're riding Trinket.

1073
00:58:22,192 --> 00:58:23,228
LAURA: I'm riding Trinket.

1074
00:58:23,228 --> 00:58:25,418
MARISHA: You're riding Trinket, okay.

1075
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:29,372
MATT: All right. Grog and Scanlan, you guys are up
first.

1076
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:41,930
SAM: I'll go first. I'm not going to do much, but
I will take out my Wand of Magic Missiles, because

1077
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:52,411
I've got to use everything I got. And I will
shoot, fuck it, six missiles, I'll use six of the

1078
00:58:52,411 --> 00:58:55,962
slots. So it's three plus another five.

1079
00:58:55,962 --> 00:58:58,013
MATT: Okay, and how many total do you have on
there?

1080
00:58:58,013 --> 00:59:02,082
SAM: Every day it recharges and I rolled and it's
back up to seven.

1081
00:59:02,082 --> 00:59:06,266
MATT: Okay, got you. So seven is the max you can
hold for that. Okay. So you're using the last of

1082
00:59:06,266 --> 00:59:07,768
yours for this, this is the last.

1083
00:59:07,768 --> 00:59:09,473
SAM: I am using six of the seven.

1084
00:59:09,473 --> 00:59:12,737
MATT: Okay, got you. Okay. Got you. Then go ahead
and roll for that.

1085
00:59:12,737 --> 00:59:14,718
TRAVIS: Put the stank on this guy.

1086
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:19,389
SAM: What do I do? 11. I don't-- what am I adding
to this?

1087
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:23,164
MATT: Well, for Magic Missile, you keep
firing--

1088
00:59:23,164 --> 00:59:25,164
MARISHA: It just happens.

1089
00:59:25,164 --> 00:59:28,190
MATT: Yeah, you don't have to roll, they all hit
automatically, that's the good thing about Magic

1090
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:35,638
Missile, it just hits. All right, so you create
three darts, so it's 3d4 plus three, and then if

1091
00:59:35,698 --> 00:59:37,953
you're casting it at 6th-level, you said?

1092
00:59:37,953 --> 00:59:39,228
SAM: Yeah.

1093
00:59:39,228 --> 00:59:47,461
MATT: All right. That'll be an additional five
darts. 8d4 plus eight.

1094
00:59:47,461 --> 01:00:04,360
SAM: Okay. Three, five, eight, 12. 14, 15, 17. 17
plus eight. 25.

1095
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:10,454
MATT: 25 points of damage to the giant. As you
jump off Grog's shoulder, pull out your wand, it

1096
01:00:10,527 --> 01:00:15,379
all of a sudden glows for a second, and from that
point like a swarming anime missile storm, these

1097
01:00:15,379 --> 01:00:23,508
unerringly hitting arcane missiles slamming into
the sides of the giant. (growls) You can see bits

1098
01:00:23,508 --> 01:00:29,062
of its flesh unfolding and spilling off to the
side, exposing some bone underneath, as all of a

1099
01:00:29,062 --> 01:00:34,352
sudden its attention shifts, looking over its
shoulder at the three of you. As it begins to

1100
01:00:34,352 --> 01:00:39,454
right itself, preparing being flanked on each
side, a little bit of undead intelligence within

1101
01:00:39,454 --> 01:00:42,747
its brain knowing how to defend itself. (growls)

1102
01:00:42,747 --> 01:00:48,659
SAM: As my movement, I'm going to-- where am I?

1103
01:00:48,659 --> 01:00:50,699
MATT: You're right here, on the side of Grog.

1104
01:00:50,699 --> 01:00:57,032
SAM: I'm going to move just in that thing. Where's
the laser?

1105
01:00:57,032 --> 01:00:58,563
TALIESIN: Oh, the thingie?

1106
01:00:58,563 --> 01:01:01,044
SAM: I don't know. I'm going to move to my left
into that little alcove there.

1107
01:01:01,044 --> 01:01:04,901
MATT: Okay, so you're kind of hiding around the
wall of the one of the buildings, and as you dart

1108
01:01:04,901 --> 01:01:07,532
to the side, kind of glancing around the corner.

1109
01:01:07,532 --> 01:01:09,860
SAM: And I'll sing a song of inspiration for
Grog.

1110
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:11,271
MATT: All righty.

1111
01:01:11,271 --> 01:01:18,770
SAM: (sings) Well now Whitestone's got problems,
and now we really can't solve them, unless we make

1112
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:24,152
really deep cuts, so baby show me that Grog
blood!

1113
01:01:24,152 --> 01:01:27,192
(laughter)

1114
01:01:27,192 --> 01:01:29,603
MATT: Take your d10 inspiration.

1115
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:31,173
TRAVIS: Wow.

1116
01:01:31,173 --> 01:01:34,400
MATT: Grog, you're up. Hearing this beat in the
back of your head as Scanlan's

1117
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,753
stomping his foot--

1118
01:01:35,753 --> 01:01:37,393
TRAVIS: This is my jam!

1119
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:40,776
(laughter)

1120
01:01:40,776 --> 01:01:45,418
TRAVIS: I go into a frenzied rage and I rush the
stone giant from behind.

1121
01:01:45,418 --> 01:01:50,374
And I take aim at his right--

1122
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:52,124
MATT: You guys are almost in the same position,
there.

1123
01:01:52,124 --> 01:01:54,398
TRAVIS: At his right leg, yeah--

1124
01:01:54,398 --> 01:01:56,011
MATT: Oh, you're spooning.

1125
01:01:56,011 --> 01:01:57,448
TRAVIS: I aim at the back of his right knee.

1126
01:01:57,448 --> 01:01:58,913
MATT: Go for it.

1127
01:01:58,913 --> 01:02:00,901
TRAVIS: 17?

1128
01:02:00,901 --> 01:02:02,047
MATT: That hits.

1129
01:02:02,047 --> 01:02:03,844
TRAVIS: Should I roll damage first? Or all three.

1130
01:02:03,844 --> 01:02:06,549
MATT: There's no other current combat target, so
you can roll all three, it's fine.

1131
01:02:06,549 --> 01:02:09,150
TRAVIS: 26?

1132
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:10,283
MATT: Hits.

1133
01:02:10,283 --> 01:02:13,614
TRAVIS: 24, sorry. And 19.

1134
01:02:13,614 --> 01:02:18,122
MATT: Hits. He's very slow-moving and a very large
target, he's very easy to hit, thankfully. So as

1135
01:02:18,122 --> 01:02:20,773
you rush up, first, what you got?

1136
01:02:20,773 --> 01:02:24,091
TRAVIS: 22 for the first one.

1137
01:02:24,091 --> 01:02:25,378
MATT: 22, nice.

1138
01:02:25,378 --> 01:02:29,660
TRAVIS: 13 for the second one.

1139
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:30,915
MATT: Nice.

1140
01:02:30,915 --> 01:02:35,195
TRAVIS: 15 for the third one.

1141
01:02:35,195 --> 01:02:41,531
MATT: Nice! (whack) You slam the hammer into the
side of one of its calves. It buckles for a second

1142
01:02:41,531 --> 01:02:45,579
and you can see the muscle itself kind of snap and
a piece of bone is now jutting out of the side of

1143
01:02:45,579 --> 01:02:46,622
its leg.

1144
01:02:46,622 --> 01:02:48,545
TRAVIS: (singing) Now we got Grog's blood.

1145
01:02:48,545 --> 01:02:50,082
(laughter)

1146
01:02:50,082 --> 01:02:52,451
MATT: With that, you swing the hammer around and
slam it into the bone, actually jamming it deeper

1147
01:02:52,451 --> 01:02:53,459
into its leg.

1148
01:02:53,459 --> 01:02:54,944
(all yell)

1149
01:02:54,944 --> 01:02:56,725
TRAVIS: Yes, yes!

1150
01:02:56,725 --> 01:03:00,061
MATT: As you pull back, these slow flames kind of
burning the outside, you can see the flesh

1151
01:03:00,061 --> 01:03:04,624
sizzling with the impact of the burning hammer.
Swing it once in your hand, whack! Onto the other

1152
01:03:04,624 --> 01:03:09,830
side, this time the actual leg bursts out that
side and it falls almost a little bit, it's sort

1153
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:15,733
of walking on this stump of a leg now, you pretty
much destroyed the bottom half of its middle of

1154
01:03:15,733 --> 01:03:21,019
its calf to its foot, it's just slumping over, the
toe's still kind of wiggling on its own. It's now

1155
01:03:21,076 --> 01:03:30,582
half on part of its leg as at this point it kind
of rotates in place towards you now, using one

1156
01:03:30,582 --> 01:03:34,593
hand to get around as it brings this club up.
Looking up into its face now, as you haven't

1157
01:03:34,593 --> 01:03:39,166
really had a close-up on this, it's strange to
see, you see there are similar features, you've

1158
01:03:39,166 --> 01:03:43,291
encountered stone giants this up close and this
personal, there is where your brethren, your blood

1159
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:50,555
comes from. However, half of its face is torn off
by some sort of large claw mark. Where there would

1160
01:03:50,555 --> 01:03:57,032
be an eye is just this sunken socket and there are
these streaks of dried blood that long before the

1161
01:03:57,032 --> 01:04:01,910
rainstorm came are just smeared across the face,
and part of its jaw is broken open and you can see

1162
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:07,999
jagged broken teeth underneath, its tongue lolls out the
side and it just (undead groan) reaches up with

1163
01:04:07,999 --> 01:04:12,891
its club to come on down. (laughs) All right, so
the first, it's going to come down and strike you

1164
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:19,755
with this giant club-like piece of heavy wood and
metal. That's a natural 20.

1165
01:04:19,755 --> 01:04:24,890
LAURA: His face as he said it.

1166
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:27,783
MATT: That's an 18 plus nine, so it's--

1167
01:04:27,783 --> 01:04:29,791
TRAVIS: 27, halved.

1168
01:04:29,791 --> 01:04:32,135
MATT: Well no, that's to hit.

1169
01:04:32,135 --> 01:04:33,985
TRAVIS: Oh, the hit. Got you.

1170
01:04:33,985 --> 01:04:46,103
MATT: All right, so. First strike comes at you for
16 points of bludgeoning damage, halved to eight.

1171
01:04:46,103 --> 01:04:55,877
The other one comes to you at 14 points of
bludgeoning damage, halved to seven. It looks

1172
01:04:55,877 --> 01:05:01,106
very, very angry and very frustrated with the
current circumstance. But you take each blow to

1173
01:05:01,106 --> 01:05:05,952
the chest, showing off that strength you normally
would do to something of your kin and ilk, even

1174
01:05:05,952 --> 01:05:14,128
though it's not really living, old habits are hard
to break. Finishing its turn, three resistance

1175
01:05:14,128 --> 01:05:18,674
members rush into its side, as it's now turned to
face you with its broken leg. Rushing in, strike

1176
01:05:18,674 --> 01:05:26,418
it. Hits, hits, hits. All have short swords out
and they're just stabbing it in the side of its

1177
01:05:26,418 --> 01:05:34,728
body now that they have this opening and this
distraction in the current moment. Five, five,

1178
01:05:34,728 --> 01:05:38,561
five, which is 21 points of slashing damage.

1179
01:05:38,561 --> 01:05:40,038
TRAVIS: Damn.

1180
01:05:40,038 --> 01:05:43,292
MATT: From all three of them just stabbing it with
a blade in the side. That ends its turn, bringing

1181
01:05:43,292 --> 01:05:44,866
it to the top, Pike, you're up.

1182
01:05:44,866 --> 01:05:46,260
LAURA: Go Pike!

1183
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:48,322
ASHLEY: Wait, I rolled a six!

1184
01:05:48,322 --> 01:05:49,960
MATT: Yeah. Now it's your turn.

1185
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,072
ASHLEY: It's already my turn?

1186
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:53,005
MATT: Yep, everyone else went. It's your turn.

1187
01:05:53,005 --> 01:05:55,928
ASHLEY: Okay. So I'm going to Guiding Bolt.

1188
01:05:55,928 --> 01:05:57,367
MATT: Okay.

1189
01:05:57,367 --> 01:06:01,963
ASHLEY: That guy. Or wait, is anybody-- where are
you at?

1190
01:06:01,963 --> 01:06:06,390
SAM: He's right there, but go ahead. Go ahead,
Pike.

1191
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:07,882
ASHLEY: All right.

1192
01:06:07,882 --> 01:06:08,893
SAM: Light him up.

1193
01:06:08,893 --> 01:06:09,947
MATT: You got this.

1194
01:06:09,947 --> 01:06:13,068
LIAM: Friendly fire just turns Grog on.

1195
01:06:13,068 --> 01:06:14,876
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm just getting a warm-up right
now.

1196
01:06:14,876 --> 01:06:18,918
MATT: So go ahead and make a ranged spell attack.
Roll a d20 and add your spell attack modifier.

1197
01:06:18,918 --> 01:06:21,757
SAM: Most of his damage comes from behind.

1198
01:06:21,757 --> 01:06:26,482
ASHLEY: 17.

1199
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:28,553
MATT: Okay, are you casting it at 1st level or a
higher level?

1200
01:06:28,553 --> 01:06:33,057
ASHLEY: I'll cast it at a four.

1201
01:06:33,057 --> 01:06:35,245
MATT: Okay. All right. And what'd you roll?

1202
01:06:35,245 --> 01:06:36,484
TRAVIS: 17.

1203
01:06:36,484 --> 01:06:40,984
MATT: 17 definitely hits, so go ahead and roll 7d6
radiant damage.

1204
01:06:40,984 --> 01:06:42,336
MARISHA: What?

1205
01:06:42,336 --> 01:06:43,954
SAM: Wait, what?

1206
01:06:43,954 --> 01:06:46,372
LAURA: How did we not have Pike with us this whole
time?

1207
01:06:46,372 --> 01:06:48,046
MATT: 7d6 radiant damage.

1208
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:51,981
TRAVIS: Vaporize this motherfucker. (laughs) Cross
the streams!

1209
01:06:51,981 --> 01:06:54,019
(laughter)

1210
01:06:54,019 --> 01:06:56,317
SAM: Oh no, Grog, that means you're going to get
that much damage.

1211
01:06:56,317 --> 01:06:58,240
TRAVIS: But I'm a good person.

1212
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,014
MARISHA: Yeah, it's radiant, it should do more
against him.

1213
01:07:01,014 --> 01:07:03,987
MATT: Actually, this is a single-target spell,
there's no radius to this.

1214
01:07:03,987 --> 01:07:06,350
MARISHA: Single attack. All right.

1215
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:10,163
MATT: What's your total damage?

1216
01:07:10,163 --> 01:07:11,836
ASHLEY: 24.

1217
01:07:11,836 --> 01:07:13,239
MATT: 24 points of radiant damage.

1218
01:07:13,239 --> 01:07:14,197
ASHLEY: Yes.

1219
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:19,575
MATT: Okay. So as you stand there for a second,
you pull your holy symbol up, kind of putting your

1220
01:07:19,575 --> 01:07:24,151
shield to the side, and as you release your hand
out in front of you, this beam of divine energy

1221
01:07:24,151 --> 01:07:29,767
streaks out, slamming into the zombie giant. As it
hits, it continues to burn like a stream into its

1222
01:07:29,767 --> 01:07:35,342
body, searing the flesh in a path as it does. As
it impacts, it leaves this glowing, pulsing divine

1223
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:40,071
symbol across its chest of Sarenrae. The next
attack against it has advantage.

1224
01:07:40,071 --> 01:07:42,752
SAM: From Pike or from everybody?

1225
01:07:42,752 --> 01:07:46,147
MATT: No, the next person to attack it gets
advantage.

1226
01:07:46,147 --> 01:07:47,624
TRAVIS: Did I take any damage?

1227
01:07:47,624 --> 01:07:51,925
MATT: No, no, she was very precise with her impact
on the giant. All right, do you want to move on

1228
01:07:51,925 --> 01:07:55,549
your turn at all, Pike? Stay where you are, or do
you want to move close to it?

1229
01:07:55,549 --> 01:07:56,987
ASHLEY: Where am I, sorry?

1230
01:07:56,987 --> 01:07:58,656
LAURA: Oh, can you not see? You're far away.

1231
01:07:58,656 --> 01:08:00,889
ASHLEY: I can't see very well. I'll stay.

1232
01:08:00,889 --> 01:08:04,670
MATT: Okay, you'll stay where you are. Okay, you
keep your distance from it, let Grog do his thing.

1233
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:08,221
Okay, that brings us to the top of the round.
Grog, Scanlan, you guys are up again.

1234
01:08:08,221 --> 01:08:09,955
TRAVIS: Would you like to go?

1235
01:08:09,955 --> 01:08:12,640
SAM: Next attack has advantage, I defer to you.
I'll hold my roll.

1236
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:17,231
TRAVIS: Sweet. If he's starting to lean down, I
want to take his head and turn it

1237
01:08:17,231 --> 01:08:18,753
into a tee-ball target.

1238
01:08:18,753 --> 01:08:20,222
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

1239
01:08:20,222 --> 01:08:22,073
MARISHA: Don't forget about your weapon master
thing.

1240
01:08:22,073 --> 01:08:23,511
TRAVIS: Yeah, but then he gets advantage.

1241
01:08:23,511 --> 01:08:26,751
MATT: The thing is, you can use the minus five to
hit plus ten to damage.

1242
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,936
MARISHA: Yeah, that one.

1243
01:08:27,936 --> 01:08:29,495
MATT: It's what he's been doing.

1244
01:08:29,495 --> 01:08:37,201
TRAVIS: I didn't do it on the last one. Let's do
it! Why not? Okay. We'll do great weapon master.

1245
01:08:37,201 --> 01:08:40,733
We'll use it on that one.

1246
01:08:40,733 --> 01:08:44,004
SAM: Oh, you have advantage too.

1247
01:08:44,004 --> 01:08:45,667
LAURA: Yeah, you have advantage.

1248
01:08:45,667 --> 01:08:48,880
TRAVIS: That's even worse.

1249
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,474
MATT: There you go.

1250
01:08:50,474 --> 01:08:52,972
LAURA: No, that was better.

1251
01:08:52,972 --> 01:08:56,526
TRAVIS: 16?

1252
01:08:56,526 --> 01:08:58,201
MATT: 16 hits.

1253
01:08:58,201 --> 01:08:59,587
TRAVIS: Oh good, okay.

1254
01:08:59,587 --> 01:09:02,183
MATT: Once again, big target, not very hard to
hit, just has a lot of hit points.

1255
01:09:02,183 --> 01:09:03,512
TRAVIS: 16 again.

1256
01:09:03,512 --> 01:09:04,814
MATT: 16 also hits.

1257
01:09:04,814 --> 01:09:07,301
TRAVIS: That'll work. 26.

1258
01:09:07,301 --> 01:09:08,720
MATT: All right. All three hit.

1259
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:11,813
TALIESIN: Kill it with fire.

1260
01:09:11,813 --> 01:09:21,996
TRAVIS: Kill it with fire. Sorry. Ten, 11, 21--

1261
01:09:21,996 --> 01:09:23,758
LAURA: Plus another ten for great weapon--

1262
01:09:23,758 --> 01:09:25,727
TRAVIS: I did it, yeah. That was 11 plus ten.

1263
01:09:25,727 --> 01:09:26,989
MATT: Okay.

1264
01:09:26,989 --> 01:09:34,824
TRAVIS: 15, so 25.

1265
01:09:34,824 --> 01:09:36,429
MATT: 25, all righty.

1266
01:09:36,429 --> 01:09:38,221
LIAM: Can these actors do addition?

1267
01:09:38,221 --> 01:09:39,855
MARISHA: I know. (laughs)

1268
01:09:39,855 --> 01:09:43,579
TRAVIS: 18, 23, 33.

1269
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:45,295
MATT: 33 points of damage.

1270
01:09:45,295 --> 01:09:46,800
MARISHA: Holy shit. Nice!

1271
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:50,436
MATT: All right. So as you swing the hammer
upward, (whack) it hits along the side of its

1272
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:53,811
skull and you can see its skull
actually cave in and crack a bit, bone and flesh

1273
01:09:53,884 --> 01:10:01,295
scraped away. Where it cracks, you can see a bit
of black brain mass begin to leak through. Using

1274
01:10:01,295 --> 01:10:04,421
that, you spin the hammer around and hit it again
the same place, (whack) finding the weak point,

1275
01:10:04,421 --> 01:10:08,256
this time. Just the anger to smash through.
(impact sound) It caves inward, and you can see

1276
01:10:08,256 --> 01:10:15,111
bits of bone jam into its one semi-functioning
eye. Its head now loosely pushed in on one side.

1277
01:10:15,111 --> 01:10:19,584
The jaw hangs a little bit loose. The third
strike, you come down, (whack) hit it from the

1278
01:10:19,584 --> 01:10:22,202
other side. The jaw dislodges and goes flying
off.

1279
01:10:22,202 --> 01:10:23,405
TRAVIS: Dibs!

1280
01:10:23,405 --> 01:10:25,655
(laughter)

1281
01:10:25,655 --> 01:10:28,037
MATT: But it's still standing.

1282
01:10:28,107 --> 01:10:29,582
LAURA: Without a head?!

1283
01:10:29,582 --> 01:10:33,652
MATT: His head's still there. His jaw is
dislodged. The lower half of his jaw is missing.

1284
01:10:33,652 --> 01:10:37,620
It's just this open part. His tongue dangling
loosely out of the bottom. Part of its head caved

1285
01:10:37,681 --> 01:10:40,742
inward, just (deep zombie groan).

1286
01:10:40,742 --> 01:10:43,376
TRAVIS: Shove my hand up your skull and work you
like a sock puppet!

1287
01:10:43,376 --> 01:10:46,327
(laughter)

1288
01:10:46,327 --> 01:10:47,712
MATT: Are you going to stay where you are, Grog?

1289
01:10:47,712 --> 01:10:48,501
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1290
01:10:48,501 --> 01:10:49,657
MATT: All right. Scanlan, you're up.

1291
01:10:49,657 --> 01:10:51,061
SAM: How far can I move?

1292
01:10:51,061 --> 01:10:53,087
MATT: You can move 25 feet, so five squares.

1293
01:10:53,087 --> 01:10:54,248
SAM: 25? That's it?

1294
01:10:54,248 --> 01:10:56,737
MATT: You're a little gnome, dude. You have little
legs.

1295
01:10:56,737 --> 01:11:03,152
SAM: Can I get next to Grog? Can I get near Grog?
Can I get at an angle where I won't hit Grog with

1296
01:11:03,152 --> 01:11:04,406
lightning?

1297
01:11:04,406 --> 01:11:07,421
MATT: You can, but at pretty much every angle,
you're going to hit somebody

1298
01:11:07,421 --> 01:11:08,226
aside from the giant.

1299
01:11:08,226 --> 01:11:09,724
SAM: Oh, I don't care about those guys.

1300
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:11,156
(laughter)

1301
01:11:11,156 --> 01:11:18,829
SAM: I guess I should. Pike's with me. I've got to
do this right. Damn it! (groans) If only you

1302
01:11:18,829 --> 01:11:21,570
weren't here, Pike. Pike, don't look!

1303
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:22,749
MATT: What are you doing?

1304
01:11:22,749 --> 01:11:25,240
LIAM: You shoot it at an angle up at his head. Up
into the sky.

1305
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:30,642
SAM: All right. I will try to hit him with a
Lightning Bolt, but miss as many people as

1306
01:11:30,642 --> 01:11:31,346
possible.

1307
01:11:31,346 --> 01:11:36,303
MATT: He's tall. He's down a little bit because of
the impact that Grog gave, but at a higher angle,

1308
01:11:36,303 --> 01:11:38,189
you could probably hit him without hitting the
other guy.

1309
01:11:38,189 --> 01:11:42,261
SAM: Okay. I will angle up. This time, I would
like the lightning to come from my ass.

1310
01:11:42,261 --> 01:11:45,901
MATT: You're William Wallace-ing it.

1311
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:51,184
SAM: Yes. And I'll just lightning him at normal
lightning damage.

1312
01:11:51,184 --> 01:11:57,663
MATT: All right, so 8d6 damage. Does not make its
saving throw with a three.

1313
01:11:57,663 --> 01:11:59,793
LAURA: How can you even aim like that, Scanlan?

1314
01:11:59,793 --> 01:12:03,496
SAM: Oh, I have practiced aiming things with my
ass in this campaign.

1315
01:12:03,496 --> 01:12:05,912
MATT: Very true. Sadly.

1316
01:12:05,912 --> 01:12:14,512
SAM: (counts quietly) 28.

1317
01:12:14,512 --> 01:12:22,899
MATT: 28 points of damage. All right. (lightning
crash) The bolt of lightning shoots off into the

1318
01:12:22,899 --> 01:12:28,050
sky, arcing through its body. You can see where
part of its neck muscle was torn, it fuses into

1319
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:33,891
its shoulder from the impact of the bolt. (moans)
Almost falls over from the blast. However, it

1320
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:37,937
catches itself and (grunts) gets right back up.
It's looking pretty rough, but it's still keeping

1321
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:39,745
itself there, yeah.

1322
01:12:39,745 --> 01:12:42,228
SAM: What? I just farted lightning on him!

1323
01:12:42,228 --> 01:12:45,506
MATT: That ends your turn?

1324
01:12:45,506 --> 01:12:53,348
SAM: I'll inspire Pike. I'll turn to her and I'll
say, (sings) I wish they all could be cleric

1325
01:12:53,348 --> 01:12:55,063
gnomian girls.

1326
01:12:55,063 --> 01:12:57,469
(laughter)

1327
01:12:57,469 --> 01:13:02,119
MATT: All right, Pike. You get a d10 inspiration
dice from Scanlan, a voice you've longed to hear

1328
01:13:02,119 --> 01:13:06,986
for some time, as your friendship has been so far
away. Take your 1d10.

1329
01:13:06,986 --> 01:13:08,574
LAURA: Hear that, Scanlan? Friendship.

1330
01:13:08,574 --> 01:13:10,906
SAM: Friendship? Aw, man.

1331
01:13:10,906 --> 01:13:16,099
MATT: All right, so on the zombie giant's turn, it
recovers from the bolt of lightning, looking at

1332
01:13:16,099 --> 01:13:20,853
this large target in front of it, it sees this
tiny little morsel and you see it brings up its

1333
01:13:20,853 --> 01:13:28,138
leg that's partially destroyed and (heavy
footsteps) begins to move forward just to there,

1334
01:13:28,138 --> 01:13:33,580
to get you within range. It's going to move a
little closer. It gets two attacks of opportunity

1335
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:35,044
from the guards behind it.

1336
01:13:35,044 --> 01:13:35,859
SAM: Two?

1337
01:13:35,859 --> 01:13:37,342
TALIESIN: I was about to say, the guard is there.

1338
01:13:37,342 --> 01:13:38,617
LAURA: Against it. Against it.

1339
01:13:38,617 --> 01:13:44,321
MATT: That somehow actually misses with a two.
That does hit, though, so it takes-- oh, nice--

1340
01:13:44,321 --> 01:13:50,306
eight points of slashing damage from one of the
guards that, as it runs by, just swings out and

1341
01:13:50,306 --> 01:13:54,869
slashes across its thigh. As it comes up towards
you, it (zombie groan), its tongue dangling out,

1342
01:13:54,869 --> 01:14:00,803
this horrible gurgling sound coming out of what is
now technically its open throat. As it brings its

1343
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:02,067
club upward--

1344
01:14:02,067 --> 01:14:10,468
SAM: As my reaction, I bring up my shawm-- it's a
horn-- and I blow the note. The note is like Dumb

1345
01:14:10,468 --> 01:14:18,130
and Dumber, the sound he makes? (off-key horn
noise) That most annoying sound. (off-key horn

1346
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:21,285
noise) And mash all my fingers down.

1347
01:14:21,285 --> 01:14:23,597
MATT: Okay. Is this your--

1348
01:14:23,597 --> 01:14:26,976
SAM: This is my trying to-- Cutting Words!

1349
01:14:26,976 --> 01:14:33,517
MATT: Cutting Words? Okay. All right, well it
rolled a 21 to hit. For Cutting Words, you roll a

1350
01:14:33,517 --> 01:14:37,516
d10 and subtract that from the attack roll,
right?

1351
01:14:37,516 --> 01:14:38,470
SAM: What is this?

1352
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:39,683
TALIESIN AND MARISHA: That is a ten.

1353
01:14:39,683 --> 01:14:41,375
MARISHA: Big money, no whammies.

1354
01:14:41,375 --> 01:14:42,313
SAM: One.

1355
01:14:42,313 --> 01:14:43,120
MARISHA: Fuck!

1356
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,200
(laughter)

1357
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,510
MATT: So, 20. Does that hit?

1358
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:46,265
SAM: That hits.

1359
01:14:46,265 --> 01:14:48,541
MATT: All right, so (off-key horn noise, ping).

1360
01:14:48,541 --> 01:14:49,920
(laughter)

1361
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,177
MATT: (laughing) Horrible shrieking sound.

1362
01:14:52,177 --> 01:14:58,081
SAM: Oh, my shawm!

1363
01:14:58,081 --> 01:15:03,585
MATT: You take 20 points of bludgeoning damage
from the first strike and your shawm is bent and

1364
01:15:03,585 --> 01:15:09,191
(weak horn noise) not quite-- you'll probably have
to buy a new one or get that repaired. You almost

1365
01:15:09,267 --> 01:15:14,131
lost a tooth in the process. As you're like,
(groans) from the impact, you pull back and you

1366
01:15:14,201 --> 01:15:18,203
can feel already, the pulsing of the blood from
the veins that have burst. It brings up its club

1367
01:15:18,203 --> 01:15:20,115
one more time. (roars)

1368
01:15:20,115 --> 01:15:21,870
SAM: Oh, god.

1369
01:15:21,870 --> 01:15:26,087
MATT: That is going to be a 13.

1370
01:15:26,087 --> 01:15:27,517
SAM: That misses!

1371
01:15:27,517 --> 01:15:29,485
(laughter)

1372
01:15:29,485 --> 01:15:32,081
MATT: This time as it brings its club up, you see
the arc, and you--

1373
01:15:32,081 --> 01:15:34,632
SAM: I'm ducking down to work on the shawm.

1374
01:15:34,632 --> 01:15:36,338
(laughter)

1375
01:15:36,338 --> 01:15:39,109
MATT: (whoosh) The swing is completely out of your
view.

1376
01:15:39,109 --> 01:15:41,675
(laughter)

1377
01:15:41,675 --> 01:15:51,858
MATT: All right, that ends its turn. The guards
are going to rush forward, now. They technically

1378
01:15:51,858 --> 01:15:56,197
have advantage on it because they're flanking with
you. A two and a three. Guys, you're killing me.

1379
01:15:56,197 --> 01:16:07,740
Four and a six. The six actually still hits. Six
and a 20. There we go. And a critical, so miss and

1380
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:08,881
then a hit and a critical.

1381
01:16:08,881 --> 01:16:10,186
TRAVIS: Nice natural 20.

1382
01:16:10,186 --> 01:16:15,248
MATT: So that's seven points of slashing damage
from the first one, and then the critical. Ooh,

1383
01:16:15,248 --> 01:16:19,585
nice. And a six on that one, so that's 12, 14
points of slashing damage from the other guy. So

1384
01:16:19,585 --> 01:16:22,419
both of the guards rush up. One of them misses
entirely. One jams the blade to the hilt in the

1385
01:16:22,419 --> 01:16:27,745
middle of its body and pulls out. The last one
actually jumps up onto its back and takes the

1386
01:16:27,819 --> 01:16:32,832
sword and slams it into its spine and drags it
down. A really decent wound for anything not this

1387
01:16:32,832 --> 01:16:37,017
big. On this size, it's a little gash, still, but
it left a nice sizable wound and it opens up and

1388
01:16:37,017 --> 01:16:41,795
this horrible smell comes reeking out. The guy
almost vomits as he backs up, just (groans). The

1389
01:16:41,795 --> 01:16:46,949
rot escaping from the wound. That ends their turn.
Pike, you're up.

1390
01:16:46,949 --> 01:16:48,838
TRAVIS: Put some hurt on this undead bastard.

1391
01:16:48,838 --> 01:16:50,814
ASHLEY: Okay. Where are you at, Scanlan?

1392
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:54,597
SAM: You mean physically or mentally? Because I'm
in love with you.

1393
01:16:54,597 --> 01:16:56,691
(laughter)

1394
01:16:56,691 --> 01:16:59,637
SAM: But I'm right next to Grog. Grog and I are
right in front of the giant.

1395
01:16:59,637 --> 01:17:01,644
ASHLEY: Health-wise, where are you at?

1396
01:17:01,644 --> 01:17:03,438
SAM: Oh, I'm fine. Don't worry about me, baby.

1397
01:17:03,438 --> 01:17:11,581
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to go up to the giant,
where the open wound is, where that guy just broke

1398
01:17:11,581 --> 01:17:15,013
it open. I have Sprinter's Boots, if I can't get
all the way up to it.

1399
01:17:15,013 --> 01:17:16,601
MATT: Yeah, you'll have to use those to get up to
him.

1400
01:17:16,601 --> 01:17:18,352
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll use Sprinter's Boots.

1401
01:17:18,352 --> 01:17:19,393
MATT: All right.

1402
01:17:19,393 --> 01:17:24,918
ASHLEY: I'm going to use my mace, and I'm going to
start ripping where that wound is.

1403
01:17:24,918 --> 01:17:27,630
MATT: Actually, the open wound would be around
here, but with Sprinter's Boots you can get there

1404
01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:32,061
just fine, yeah. So you actually get around. All
right, and you're technically flanking with Grog,

1405
01:17:32,061 --> 01:17:34,193
so you have advantage on these attacks.

1406
01:17:34,193 --> 01:17:36,046
MARISHA: Nice.

1407
01:17:36,046 --> 01:17:36,957
MATT: So go for it.

1408
01:17:36,957 --> 01:17:38,893
ASHLEY: Okay, so I roll--

1409
01:17:38,893 --> 01:17:44,815
MATT: Roll to attack twice and take the higher of
the two. I know you've been filming for a while.

1410
01:17:44,815 --> 01:17:47,373
ASHLEY: Roll the d20 twice?

1411
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:50,451
LIAM: Roll two times, take the higher of the two.

1412
01:17:50,451 --> 01:17:51,367
ASHLEY: 17.

1413
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:53,311
MATT: Okay, that's the higher of the two?

1414
01:17:53,311 --> 01:17:55,170
ASHLEY: That's the higher of the two. I had a
seven and a 17.

1415
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:59,726
MATT: Yeah, that definitely hits. Roll for the
second attack because you can use your bonus

1416
01:17:59,726 --> 01:18:01,802
action to strike because you're a war cleric.

1417
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:03,773
ASHLEY: Nine.

1418
01:18:03,773 --> 01:18:05,537
MATT: A total of nine?

1419
01:18:05,537 --> 01:18:06,964
LAURA: Did you add it to anything?

1420
01:18:06,964 --> 01:18:09,060
ASHLEY: Wait, am I supposed to add something?

1421
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:12,970
MATT: Add your attack bonus. Next to your weapon
on your character sheet.

1422
01:18:12,970 --> 01:18:14,171
ASHLEY: Shit. Sorry, guys!

1423
01:18:14,171 --> 01:18:16,603
MATT: It's okay! You're out of practice, girl.
It's all good. You've been too busy being in

1424
01:18:16,603 --> 01:18:17,712
someone's Blindspot.

1425
01:18:17,712 --> 01:18:20,373
LAURA: You're busy being in the lab.

1426
01:18:20,373 --> 01:18:21,459
ASHLEY: Oh, 17 again!

1427
01:18:21,459 --> 01:18:24,194
MATT: 17 again. There you go. Both hit. Go ahead
and roll the damage for the mace plus,

1428
01:18:24,194 --> 01:18:25,768
if I recall...

1429
01:18:25,768 --> 01:18:32,717
ASHLEY: I think it's 1d6 plus three. Plus seven if
it's an attack hit.

1430
01:18:32,717 --> 01:18:37,448
MATT: 1d6 plus three, yep. You also have a Mace of
Disruption, don't you?

1431
01:18:37,448 --> 01:18:39,022
LIAM: Disruption. I think so, yeah.

1432
01:18:39,022 --> 01:18:42,230
MATT: What was the effect on that one? Do you have
the item with you?

1433
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:47,710
ASHLEY: I do. Shit. No, I don't have the papers.

1434
01:18:47,710 --> 01:18:50,629
SAM: Stolen on the subway on the way home from
work.

1435
01:18:50,629 --> 01:18:53,325
ASHLEY: Guys, someone took it from me.

1436
01:18:53,325 --> 01:18:58,257
MATT: You also add an additional 1d8 damage to the
first strike.

1437
01:18:58,257 --> 01:19:01,313
LIAM: 2d6 radiant damage. DC 15 wisdom save.

1438
01:19:01,313 --> 01:19:05,780
MATT: It's not going to make that. It didn't make
that.

1439
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:07,021
(laughter)

1440
01:19:07,021 --> 01:19:09,310
LIAM: It's now frightened of Pike until the end of
her next turn.

1441
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:10,251
SAM: Ooh.

1442
01:19:10,251 --> 01:19:18,872
MATT: Awesome. All right, so you're rolling 1d6
plus three, plus another 1d8, and how much did you

1443
01:19:18,872 --> 01:19:19,895
say for that?

1444
01:19:19,895 --> 01:19:21,098
LIAM: 2d6 radiant damage.

1445
01:19:21,098 --> 01:19:29,172
MATT: Okay. So 3d6 plus three, and then an
additional 1d8 for each strike.

1446
01:19:29,172 --> 01:19:30,631
SAM: Wait, what?

1447
01:19:30,631 --> 01:19:32,502
ASHLEY: Wait, so one more time?

1448
01:19:32,502 --> 01:19:33,950
SAM: Why is she so goddamn powerful?

1449
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:34,789
MATT: Undead, man.

1450
01:19:34,789 --> 01:19:35,817
LIAM: Cleric vs undead.

1451
01:19:35,817 --> 01:19:37,536
ASHLEY: You said 3d6?

1452
01:19:37,536 --> 01:19:40,978
MATT: 3d6 plus three, plus an additional 1d8
radiant damage.

1453
01:19:40,978 --> 01:19:42,387
MARISHA: For every roll.

1454
01:19:42,387 --> 01:19:43,924
MATT: For both attacks, yeah.

1455
01:19:43,924 --> 01:19:44,961
MARISHA: For both attacks.

1456
01:19:44,961 --> 01:19:46,127
LAURA: Per attack.

1457
01:19:46,127 --> 01:19:47,009
ASHLEY: Fuck.

1458
01:19:47,009 --> 01:19:48,073
LAURA: This is the best.

1459
01:19:48,073 --> 01:19:48,984
ASHLEY: Okay.

1460
01:19:48,984 --> 01:19:49,987
MATT: Undead.

1461
01:19:49,987 --> 01:19:52,622
LIAM: We needed her from the get-go.

1462
01:19:52,622 --> 01:19:58,282
SAM: Matt, while she's rolling, can you describe
her hair at this moment? Is it whipping around? Is

1463
01:19:58,282 --> 01:20:02,693
it in her face? Is it covering her eyes in a sexy,
sweaty way?

1464
01:20:02,693 --> 01:20:04,532
TALIESIN: Matted with jam.

1465
01:20:04,532 --> 01:20:05,903
SAM: He's ignoring me.

1466
01:20:05,903 --> 01:20:13,380
ASHLEY: Can I use my d10? An additional d10 from
Scanlan, for the inspiration?

1467
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:15,809
MATT: Not for damage. That was just to hit.

1468
01:20:15,809 --> 01:20:19,224
ASHLEY: I'm getting carried away. Okay. 23.

1469
01:20:19,224 --> 01:20:21,012
MATT: 23 on the first hit?

1470
01:20:21,012 --> 01:20:23,782
ASHLEY: Oh, shit. I forgot the second hit!

1471
01:20:23,782 --> 01:20:24,569
MATT: Yeah.

1472
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:25,747
ASHLEY: Sorry!

1473
01:20:25,747 --> 01:20:28,064
MARISHA: 23 on the first hit.

1474
01:20:28,064 --> 01:20:29,906
ASHLEY: Sorry, guys watching. Sorry.

1475
01:20:29,906 --> 01:20:31,400
LIAM: Bring the holy retribution.

1476
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:35,835
MARISHA: They'll understand.

1477
01:20:35,835 --> 01:20:38,429
LAURA: Oh, I've missed Pike so much.

1478
01:20:38,429 --> 01:20:39,510
MARISHA: Me, too.

1479
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:41,019
ASHLEY: Oh, I've missed you, too.

1480
01:20:41,019 --> 01:20:42,769
MARISHA: I like your headphones, too, by the way.

1481
01:20:42,769 --> 01:20:44,183
LIAM: Kill, kill, kill.

1482
01:20:44,183 --> 01:20:48,915
ASHLEY: 21.

1483
01:20:48,915 --> 01:20:50,619
LAURA: Yay!

1484
01:20:50,619 --> 01:20:52,152
LIAM: All right, 44.

1485
01:20:52,152 --> 01:20:57,206
MATT: All right. The Mace of Disruption actually
has a different effect. It's not about a

1486
01:20:57,206 --> 01:21:02,599
frightened thing. If it has 25 hit points or fewer
after taking this damage, it has to make a DC 15

1487
01:21:02,599 --> 01:21:05,212
wisdom saving throw, which it fails.

1488
01:21:05,212 --> 01:21:06,617
SAM: Which means?

1489
01:21:06,617 --> 01:21:13,008
MATT: So, as you rush up along the side of it,
your Sprinter's Boots carrying you, this blur of

1490
01:21:13,008 --> 01:21:18,501
divine gnomish energy. You see, through her
somewhat shimmering, radiant form, the hair itself

1491
01:21:18,501 --> 01:21:23,411
glistens against the rain. It almost doesn't even
touch. Somehow immaculate in the middle of combat.

1492
01:21:23,411 --> 01:21:29,273
You find it slow motion in your head, and for that
brief moment, you remember how much it hurt to see

1493
01:21:29,273 --> 01:21:34,251
her go and how happy you are to have her here.
However, you, in the middle of your battle trance,

1494
01:21:34,251 --> 01:21:38,126
Pike, rush up, shield ahead. You take the mace
and, seeing the open wound, slam the mace in there

1495
01:21:38,182 --> 01:21:44,267
once (wham). As you hit, the actual undead flesh
burns away from the impact, leaving this ashy

1496
01:21:44,267 --> 01:21:51,294
swath of missing flesh in its body. The creature
gives out this weird, gurgly bellow (roar). Using

1497
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:54,143
that moment, as it rears back, how do you want to
do this?

1498
01:21:54,266 --> 01:21:57,024
(cheering)

1499
01:21:57,024 --> 01:22:03,143
MARISHA: She's gone. She ran away. She took her
headphones off and did a lap.

1500
01:22:03,143 --> 01:22:05,919
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm back. Oh my gosh.

1501
01:22:05,919 --> 01:22:11,511
MATT: The magical power of this is essentially
destroying the creature, so describe this however

1502
01:22:11,511 --> 01:22:14,240
you want to, in your radiant cleric form.

1503
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:22,053
ASHLEY: Okay, I want him to just explode with a
radiant glow.

1504
01:22:22,053 --> 01:22:30,243
MATT: Okay. As he reaches back, you see this
foothold on its knee as it's trying to keep itself

1505
01:22:30,243 --> 01:22:35,493
aloft. You leap up, using your Sprinter's Boots,
onto one of its knees. Jump in the air, dropping

1506
01:22:35,493 --> 01:22:41,231
your shield and two hands on your mace, you leap
in the air, slam it downward. As the mace impacts

1507
01:22:41,231 --> 01:22:46,767
on the front of its chest, there's this brief
moment of pause as it cracks into its flesh. Its

1508
01:22:46,767 --> 01:22:51,302
head looks down at you, and there's a burst of
divine energy as his entire torso (explosion) rips

1509
01:22:51,302 --> 01:22:56,533
open. What would be organs within that exposed,
however, are all also turned to ash as the body

1510
01:22:56,533 --> 01:23:05,558
(death rattle) dissipates and disintegrates,
falling into a puddle of liquid, messy, muddy ash

1511
01:23:05,558 --> 01:23:11,120
and bits and pieces of remaining giant there. As
Pike lands on the ground, 3-point landing, mace in

1512
01:23:11,177 --> 01:23:16,004
one hand. Walks over and picks up her shield and
looks over her shoulder at Grog and Scanlan.

1513
01:23:16,004 --> 01:23:17,694
SAM: Can I faint?

1514
01:23:17,694 --> 01:23:18,824
MATT: Yeah.

1515
01:23:18,824 --> 01:23:20,126
(laughter)

1516
01:23:20,126 --> 01:23:21,660
SAM: Oh.

1517
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:24,931
TRAVIS: He's always doing that. Welcome back,
Pike.

1518
01:23:24,931 --> 01:23:30,177
ASHLEY: (laughs) Oh boy. What the heck?

1519
01:23:30,177 --> 01:23:36,320
MATT: The three soldiers who are now there,
looking dumbfounded at this moment, step forward

1520
01:23:36,393 --> 01:23:41,415
and-- you look like fighters, except you have this
glowing, divine entity amongst the three of you.

1521
01:23:41,415 --> 01:23:48,352
He steps forward. "If I might ask, who are you,
and how did you do that?"

1522
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:54,323
TRAVIS: We're the deliverers of this town. Go.
Spread the word. It all comes down tonight.

1523
01:23:54,323 --> 01:23:55,747
MATT: "You're with the de Rolos?"

1524
01:23:55,747 --> 01:23:57,449
SAM and LAURA: (quietly) Not tonight!

1525
01:23:57,449 --> 01:23:59,770
TRAVIS: Tonight, tomorrow, tit for tat. Whatever.

1526
01:23:59,770 --> 01:24:00,947
MATT: You're not there.

1527
01:24:00,947 --> 01:24:02,134
LAURA: He is! He's there!

1528
01:24:02,134 --> 01:24:04,763
SAM: I'm just waking up. "What? What's going on?"

1529
01:24:04,763 --> 01:24:08,201
TRAVIS: It goes down in the next--

1530
01:24:08,201 --> 01:24:09,573
SAM: 24 hours.

1531
01:24:09,573 --> 01:24:14,954
TRAVIS: Don't put a timeline on it. These things--
it takes a little time.

1532
01:24:14,954 --> 01:24:18,130
MATT: "You're with the de Rolos?"

1533
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:20,992
TRAVIS: Aye, with the de Rolos.

1534
01:24:21,103 --> 01:24:23,769
MATT: "Then let it be done. Thank you for the
save. We're going to gather our wounded and

1535
01:24:23,769 --> 01:24:25,454
"prepare for the next attack."

1536
01:24:25,454 --> 01:24:29,149
SAM: Prepare. Wait for our signal. Spread the
word.

1537
01:24:29,149 --> 01:24:34,799
MATT: "All right. Men! Come!" And the three of
them rush off. They gather up a few of their

1538
01:24:34,799 --> 01:24:38,932
friends who are further down the road, all
groaning and wounded, getting up and putting their

1539
01:24:38,989 --> 01:24:45,169
arms over their friends' necks. Gathering the dead
and pulling them off the middle of the road. You

1540
01:24:45,169 --> 01:24:49,298
notice as they're pulling them off the road, each
one of their dead friends, they're actually

1541
01:24:49,298 --> 01:24:52,513
pulling out torches and lighting fire to their
corpses.

1542
01:24:52,513 --> 01:24:54,678
TRAVIS: Yeah, they don't want them to come back.

1543
01:24:54,678 --> 01:25:00,004
SAM: Should we loot? Should we loot them, first?
(laughs) That would be in poor taste.

1544
01:25:00,004 --> 01:25:01,526
MATT: So what are you guys doing?

1545
01:25:01,526 --> 01:25:03,109
TALIESIN: Check the body for secrets.

1546
01:25:03,109 --> 01:25:05,720
TRAVIS: Do we want to stay, or do we want to head
back towards the other three?

1547
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:11,217
SAM: We should start heading back. We probably
won't get there in time. Wait, Percy said to meet

1548
01:25:11,217 --> 01:25:12,361
in the west.

1549
01:25:12,361 --> 01:25:16,350
TRAVIS: That's right. We should head to the west,
to the wall. To the city wall.

1550
01:25:16,350 --> 01:25:18,942
SAM: We'll head west to our appointed meeting
spot.

1551
01:25:18,942 --> 01:25:20,950
LAURA: Wild, wild west.

1552
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:22,175
MARISHA: Vaguely west.

1553
01:25:22,175 --> 01:25:28,385
SAM: As we go, I'm looking at clotheslines for any
sort of beret type of a hat.

1554
01:25:28,385 --> 01:25:30,218
(laughter)

1555
01:25:30,218 --> 01:25:32,693
MATT: Roll perception.

1556
01:25:32,693 --> 01:25:36,002
TRAVIS: Can we roll hit dice at any time during
the day?

1557
01:25:36,002 --> 01:25:37,535
MATT: Only during a short rest.

1558
01:25:37,535 --> 01:25:39,559
TRAVIS: Got it.

1559
01:25:39,559 --> 01:25:40,889
SAM: 13.

1560
01:25:40,889 --> 01:25:43,543
MATT: 13. Not in this weather. Not in this city.

1561
01:25:43,543 --> 01:25:45,550
SAM: A yarmulke? Anything?

1562
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:48,606
MATT: Nope. Whitestone? Not really a beret kind of
people.

1563
01:25:48,606 --> 01:25:56,179
SAM: I'm a little thing. I have a little head.
Maybe it could be just a shoulder pad.

1564
01:25:56,179 --> 01:26:05,550
MATT: Like a sock. Sure! There's also no laundry
left out during the middle of a rainstorm.

1565
01:26:05,550 --> 01:26:07,475
SAM: All right, fine.

1566
01:26:07,475 --> 01:26:09,635
TRAVIS: Maybe they're terribly irresponsible.

1567
01:26:09,635 --> 01:26:14,025
MATT: It could be. Unfortunately, at this moment,
no. You are unable to see any sort of a beret or

1568
01:26:14,082 --> 01:26:18,723
could-be-fashioned-into-a-beret-type clothing
piece.

1569
01:26:18,723 --> 01:26:23,072
TRAVIS: No Dust of Tracelessness this time as we
head to the western wall.

1570
01:26:23,244 --> 01:26:24,403
MATT: Oh, Grog's getting bold!

1571
01:26:24,403 --> 01:26:26,384
TRAVIS: We're getting bold!

1572
01:26:26,384 --> 01:26:30,780
MATT: All right, so as you guys go rushing towards
the western side of the city to meet up with the

1573
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:36,515
rest of the group, the rest of you, rushing past
the center of the town square, you go running

1574
01:26:36,515 --> 01:26:44,292
through the rain to the far side. You can now see
the form that you originally saw, Vax. One of

1575
01:26:44,292 --> 01:26:48,229
these giants has been pushed back. As you get all
the way to the eastern side, you're actually

1576
01:26:48,229 --> 01:26:54,356
outside the city now; you're pushing into the
forest on the outskirts. On the raised hill

1577
01:26:54,356 --> 01:27:03,214
amongst this part of the town, just outside the
wall, there is the temple of Pelor in the center

1578
01:27:03,214 --> 01:27:04,862
of the large graveyard.

1579
01:27:04,862 --> 01:27:08,772
You can see that this zombie giant has been pushed
back. You can just barely see the crest of him

1580
01:27:08,772 --> 01:27:14,636
currently slamming some sort of large metallic
weapon around, right over the treeline, as you

1581
01:27:14,636 --> 01:27:18,178
approach the outside gate of the graveyard
itself.

1582
01:27:18,178 --> 01:27:19,416
LIAM: I'm going stealth.

1583
01:27:19,416 --> 01:27:20,855
LAURA: I Hunter's Mark him.

1584
01:27:20,855 --> 01:27:23,191
MATT: Okay. What's the range on Hunter's Mark?

1585
01:27:23,191 --> 01:27:28,897
LAURA: That's a good question. It doesn't say.

1586
01:27:28,897 --> 01:27:31,061
LAURA AND TRAVIS: 90 feet.

1587
01:27:31,061 --> 01:27:33,048
MATT: 90 feet. You're probably going to have to
get a little bit closer.

1588
01:27:33,048 --> 01:27:35,001
LAURA: Okay, I Hunter's Mark him as soon as I
can.

1589
01:27:35,001 --> 01:27:38,430
MATT: Okay, good to know. You guys all going
stealth right now, or are you all rushing in?

1590
01:27:38,430 --> 01:27:40,950
LAURA: I'm just going to rush in.

1591
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:43,721
MARISHA: Yeah, let's run. I'm just running.
Keyleth's running.

1592
01:27:43,721 --> 01:27:48,304
MATT: Okay. The gates are slammed open; part of
the metal's bent inward, like whatever was pushing

1593
01:27:48,304 --> 01:27:51,058
the giant back at this point had slammed through
the gate.

1594
01:27:51,058 --> 01:27:53,006
TALIESIN: Hey, Vax?

1595
01:27:53,006 --> 01:27:54,639
LIAM: I'm gone, man.

1596
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:55,583
TALIESIN: Oh, you're gone.

1597
01:27:55,583 --> 01:27:57,024
LIAM: Well, I rolled a 23. Am I stealthed?

1598
01:27:57,024 --> 01:27:59,127
MATT: You feel pretty stealthy.

1599
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:05,649
TALIESIN: You have an earring, though. If he's on
his ass, you have a

1600
01:28:05,649 --> 01:28:07,969
better chance of hitting him, correct?

1601
01:28:07,969 --> 01:28:09,245
LIAM: Yeah, that sounds good.

1602
01:28:09,245 --> 01:28:10,524
TALIESIN: Good to know.

1603
01:28:10,524 --> 01:28:16,327
MATT: All right, so as you guys all rush into the
center here, looking about, you can see, this

1604
01:28:16,327 --> 01:28:24,837
hefty graveyard that you visited about two days
ago: all of the graves are open. All of them are

1605
01:28:24,837 --> 01:28:30,673
excavated and open, and you're starting to see
where they're pulling a lot of these undead from.

1606
01:28:30,673 --> 01:28:32,998
TRAVIS: That's just rude.

1607
01:28:32,998 --> 01:28:38,971
MATT: However, many of them being armored and
armed means it wasn't a direct transition. They

1608
01:28:38,971 --> 01:28:42,896
were probably pulled from here and given
weapons elsewhere. But that's the first thought

1609
01:28:42,967 --> 01:28:44,897
that catches your attention as you rush in here.

1610
01:28:44,897 --> 01:28:52,955
Rain pouring down, the clapping of thunder in the
distance. You can see, there are six of these

1611
01:28:52,955 --> 01:29:00,073
soldiers that are currently hacking away at this
one giant that's being pushed up towards the edge

1612
01:29:00,073 --> 01:29:03,868
of the temple right now. It looks like it's
cornered, but it's lashing out like a wild animal.

1613
01:29:03,868 --> 01:29:06,063
Roll initiative, folks.

1614
01:29:06,063 --> 01:29:07,088
SAM: Initiative, initiative.

1615
01:29:07,088 --> 01:29:13,510
MARISHA: Damn it! It's the second one I've rolled
in a row.

1616
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:18,540
TALIESIN: I am a monster. I am a monster!

1617
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:20,287
LAURA: I've got to retire this one for a while.

1618
01:29:20,287 --> 01:29:21,828
TRAVIS: You literally are a monster.

1619
01:29:21,828 --> 01:29:23,790
TALIESIN: I have really high initiative.

1620
01:29:23,790 --> 01:29:27,621
LAURA: Did I already Hunter's Mark him now?

1621
01:29:27,621 --> 01:29:28,952
MATT: You can now, yes.

1622
01:29:28,952 --> 01:29:35,368
LIAM: And Matt? As we ran, I wanted to split off
from the group and go up along the side.

1623
01:29:35,368 --> 01:29:39,077
MATT: Along the side this way? Okay, so you'll be
over here.

1624
01:29:39,077 --> 01:29:43,584
LAURA: I leap off Trinket as we get close.

1625
01:29:43,584 --> 01:29:59,172
MATT: Oh. (chuckles) All right, so 20 to 25?
Anybody? 20 to 15?

1626
01:29:59,172 --> 01:29:59,996
LIAM: 19.

1627
01:29:59,996 --> 01:30:01,415
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm sorry. 26.

1628
01:30:01,415 --> 01:30:03,312
TRAVIS: "Oh, I'm sorry. 26."

1629
01:30:03,312 --> 01:30:05,176
LAURA: "I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention.
26."

1630
01:30:05,247 --> 01:30:07,548
SAM: "Oh, I was reading a book. Sorry."

1631
01:30:07,548 --> 01:30:09,982
TRAVIS: Come on, Shadow Turd.

1632
01:30:09,982 --> 01:30:12,567
TALIESIN: This is going to be hilarious.

1633
01:30:12,567 --> 01:30:13,933
LIAM: That's what they call me.

1634
01:30:13,933 --> 01:30:16,189
TALIESIN: I'm going to do something I've never
done before.

1635
01:30:16,189 --> 01:30:18,202
MATT: That brings us to-- Keyleth, what did you
get?

1636
01:30:18,202 --> 01:30:20,721
LAURA: Oh no! Ten.

1637
01:30:20,721 --> 01:30:22,039
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm distracted.

1638
01:30:22,039 --> 01:30:34,125
MATT: All right. The image of this whole thing--
even though it looks like it's currently

1639
01:30:34,125 --> 01:30:40,966
surrounded, its giant form, barely damaged at this
point, is still a very ominous thing that strikes

1640
01:30:40,966 --> 01:30:46,321
a bit of fear in your heart, causing you to hold
back on your initial assault. And also worrying

1641
01:30:46,321 --> 01:30:50,246
about not knowing how the rest of your party is
doing. Percy, you start this off right now.

1642
01:30:50,246 --> 01:30:51,658
TALIESIN: Pull out Bad News.

1643
01:30:51,658 --> 01:30:53,315
MATT: Okay.

1644
01:30:53,315 --> 01:30:59,355
TALIESIN: I'm going to take aim, and I'm going to
wait for it to raise its club hand up. It's

1645
01:30:59,355 --> 01:31:00,969
holding a club?

1646
01:31:00,969 --> 01:31:04,708
MATT: Actually, from this view, you can see it's
actually a very large morningstar.

1647
01:31:04,708 --> 01:31:10,983
TALIESIN: It's a very large morningstar? Drop
that. I'm going to have him drop the morningstar.

1648
01:31:10,983 --> 01:31:12,560
Aimed shot.

1649
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:13,915
MATT: All right.

1650
01:31:13,915 --> 01:31:17,809
MARISHA: Come on, Percy roll! He's got shitty AC.

1651
01:31:17,809 --> 01:31:19,694
TALIESIN: Thankfully, it's got shitty AC. 16?

1652
01:31:19,694 --> 01:31:21,131
MATT: 16 does hit.

1653
01:31:21,131 --> 01:31:22,318
TALIESIN: Drop it.

1654
01:31:22,318 --> 01:31:29,029
MATT: All right, so as you get down to the ground,
(gunshot blast) the echoing explosive shot fired

1655
01:31:29,029 --> 01:31:34,232
from the Bad News slams up as it lifts its morningstar
in the air. Two of its fingers get blown

1656
01:31:34,283 --> 01:31:39,125
off its hand, and the morningstar tumbles (boof)
onto the ground, nearly crushing one of the guards

1657
01:31:39,125 --> 01:31:43,999
nearby, who barely manages to sidestep as it
(boof, boof) lands on its side right outside the

1658
01:31:43,999 --> 01:31:48,055
temple of Pelor. Well done.

1659
01:31:48,055 --> 01:31:51,537
TALIESIN: Next shot, I'm taking a sharpshooter
shot. I'm reloading.

1660
01:31:51,610 --> 01:31:53,120
MATT: Yep, reload with your second attack.

1661
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:54,555
TALIESIN: Taking a sharpshooter shot.

1662
01:31:54,555 --> 01:31:56,232
MATT: All right.

1663
01:31:56,232 --> 01:32:02,863
TALIESIN: 15?

1664
01:32:02,863 --> 01:32:04,131
MATT: 15 hits.

1665
01:32:04,131 --> 01:32:11,543
TALIESIN: And this is also an aimed shot. Sorry, I
spent another grit. So sorry for not saying that.

1666
01:32:11,543 --> 01:32:23,279
I'll do my damage and then tell you. It was an
aimed shot to the legs, so that's-- oh my god. 16,

1667
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:34,377
26, 32 points of damage, and it needs to make a
constitution saving throw.

1668
01:32:34,377 --> 01:32:36,594
MATT: Okay. What's the DC on it?

1669
01:32:36,594 --> 01:32:43,570
TALIESIN: Oh my god, this is insane. DC equals
eight plus your proficiency modifier plus your

1670
01:32:43,570 --> 01:32:45,138
dexterity modifier?

1671
01:32:45,138 --> 01:32:46,299
MATT: Yeah.

1672
01:32:46,299 --> 01:32:49,432
TALIESIN: Proficiency modifier is four, dexterity
modifier is--

1673
01:32:49,432 --> 01:32:50,848
MATT: So, 18.

1674
01:32:50,848 --> 01:32:51,860
TALIESIN: Yeah, 18.

1675
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:55,651
MATT: All right. It rolled a 16 and has a plus
four modifier on constitution,

1676
01:32:55,651 --> 01:32:56,844
so it makes the save.

1677
01:32:56,844 --> 01:32:58,219
TALIESIN AND MARISHA: Damn it.

1678
01:32:58,219 --> 01:32:59,410
MATT: Sorry.

1679
01:32:59,410 --> 01:33:02,445
TALIESIN: That's okay. I still did a ton of
damage.

1680
01:33:02,445 --> 01:33:07,862
MATT: Yeah. (explosion) The blast took a chunk of
its physical form. Splatters against the side of

1681
01:33:07,862 --> 01:33:14,643
the temple. That ending your turn. It, having no
hand at its disposal, it glances over with this

1682
01:33:14,643 --> 01:33:22,244
slow turning head. (groans) Reaches over and grabs
a big piece of the stone rubble that was destroyed

1683
01:33:22,244 --> 01:33:28,811
from the corner of the temple. Picks it up over
its head (grunts) and lobs it at you across the

1684
01:33:28,811 --> 01:33:31,097
way. (whoosh, whoosh, whoosh)

1685
01:33:31,097 --> 01:33:32,481
MARISHA: (groans)

1686
01:33:32,481 --> 01:33:34,507
MATT: That's going to be a 21 to hit.

1687
01:33:34,507 --> 01:33:35,736
TALIESIN: Oh, that hits.

1688
01:33:35,736 --> 01:33:44,143
MATT: That hits? You take 28 points of bludgeoning
damage and have to make a strength saving throw.

1689
01:33:44,143 --> 01:33:48,238
TALIESIN: Just strength saving throw?

1690
01:33:48,238 --> 01:33:50,395
MATT: Yep.

1691
01:33:50,395 --> 01:33:52,249
TALIESIN: No, I rolled a one.

1692
01:33:52,249 --> 01:33:53,651
MARISHA: Fuck!

1693
01:33:53,651 --> 01:33:59,266
MATT: So it slams into you and knocks you off your
feet, prone from the sheer impact. It rests on

1694
01:33:59,266 --> 01:34:07,748
part of your arm and you have to (grunts) work
hard to push it off. That will end its turn.

1695
01:34:07,748 --> 01:34:09,498
TALIESIN: How much damage did it do to me?

1696
01:34:09,498 --> 01:34:10,418
MATT: 28.

1697
01:34:10,418 --> 01:34:11,381
TALIESIN: 28?

1698
01:34:11,381 --> 01:34:15,700
MATT: 28 points of bludgeoning damage. That ends
its go. Vax, you're up.

1699
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:20,338
LIAM: I'm watching everything unfold. I see my
sister roll up. I hold.

1700
01:34:20,338 --> 01:34:22,881
MATT: Okay. Vex?

1701
01:34:22,881 --> 01:34:29,767
LAURA: I say, brother. You remember that giant a
few years back?

1702
01:34:29,767 --> 01:34:31,600
LIAM: I remember that giant.

1703
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:38,540
LAURA: You're up. And I shoot two arrows for my
two attacks. One into his thigh and one into his

1704
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:40,776
breast, right here.

1705
01:34:40,776 --> 01:34:43,043
MATT: Okay, go for it. Roll for two attacks.

1706
01:34:43,092 --> 01:34:44,732
LIAM: Ooh.

1707
01:34:44,732 --> 01:34:47,566
LAURA: I don't know which ones to go with!

1708
01:34:47,566 --> 01:34:48,992
SAM: They both fail.

1709
01:34:48,992 --> 01:34:51,478
LAURA: They both hit. They're both 24s.

1710
01:34:51,478 --> 01:34:52,586
MATT: Both 24s?

1711
01:34:52,586 --> 01:34:53,677
LIAM: Identical.

1712
01:34:53,677 --> 01:34:56,106
MATT: Both hit, yeah. Roll damage for each.

1713
01:34:56,106 --> 01:35:00,818
LAURA: All right. That's so crazy!

1714
01:35:00,818 --> 01:35:02,006
TRAVIS: Same thing.

1715
01:35:02,006 --> 01:35:12,050
LAURA: Yeah. Plus 14 is... 26? 26, 27, 28, 29, 30,
plus Hunter's Mark for both.

1716
01:35:12,050 --> 01:35:13,908
MATT: 2d6 on top of that.

1717
01:35:13,908 --> 01:35:17,407
LAURA: 33, 37 points of damage.

1718
01:35:17,407 --> 01:35:22,923
MATT: 37 points of damage. (arrows flying and
landing) It slams into the knee itself, pushing

1719
01:35:22,923 --> 01:35:30,332
out the kneecap a little bit from the side of its
softened flesh. The other one (boof) sticks and

1720
01:35:30,332 --> 01:35:34,389
disappears into its torso. You don't even see the
impact. It pushes through the flesh and vanishes

1721
01:35:34,389 --> 01:35:36,030
into its very large--

1722
01:35:36,030 --> 01:35:38,768
LAURA: Wait, the whole arrow goes in? I wanted to
leave some of it out.

1723
01:35:38,768 --> 01:35:48,752
MATT: Okay. We'll say for the piece of impact
here. Okay, roll a strength check.

1724
01:35:48,752 --> 01:35:51,582
TALIESIN: I believe in you.

1725
01:35:51,582 --> 01:35:55,617
MATT: This is control over your strength on this
one.

1726
01:35:55,617 --> 01:35:58,502
LAURA: 21.

1727
01:35:58,502 --> 01:36:00,270
MATT: 21? What did you roll?

1728
01:36:00,270 --> 01:36:01,631
LAURA AND LIAM: 19.

1729
01:36:01,631 --> 01:36:02,827
MATT: What's your strength?

1730
01:36:02,827 --> 01:36:06,940
LAURA: Oh, that's saving throw. Wait. Wait, yeah!
Oh, damn it. 17.

1731
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:09,918
MATT: 17. I was going to say, you have minus two
strength. I know that.

1732
01:36:09,918 --> 01:36:10,981
LAURA: Sorry.

1733
01:36:10,981 --> 01:36:15,641
MATT: It's okay. That's still enough. Gauging,
pulling back on what little bit of focus you have

1734
01:36:15,641 --> 01:36:19,633
as far as restraining. You're good at aim;
restraining is something you have difficulty with.

1735
01:36:19,633 --> 01:36:25,582
But you release the arrow, hitting at a very
defined mark, shattering part of its rib there in

1736
01:36:25,582 --> 01:36:28,949
the front, and the arrow sticking out by about a
good six inches or so.

1737
01:36:28,949 --> 01:36:30,157
MARISHA: Nice.

1738
01:36:30,157 --> 01:36:33,394
LIAM: I start running. Am I within 30 feet? It's
hard to tell from here.

1739
01:36:33,394 --> 01:36:35,395
MATT: You are not.

1740
01:36:35,395 --> 01:36:39,557
LIAM: All right, so I hit one ankle against the
other on my boots and everything slows down around

1741
01:36:39,557 --> 01:36:43,019
me a little bit, and I double my speed and run
towards it.

1742
01:36:43,019 --> 01:36:44,666
MATT: Did you use your Boots of Haste at the end
of last session?

1743
01:36:44,666 --> 01:36:46,284
LIAM: I don't know.

1744
01:36:46,284 --> 01:36:50,547
SAM: It's been a long day. We've had three
sessions.

1745
01:36:50,547 --> 01:36:52,150
MATT: I feel like you used it.

1746
01:36:52,150 --> 01:36:57,617
LIAM: If there's doubt, then I can't do it. All
right, I still run at it.

1747
01:36:57,617 --> 01:37:02,242
MATT: You could use a bonus action to dash, don't
forget, as a rogue.

1748
01:37:02,242 --> 01:37:09,098
LIAM: That's what I do. He's surrounded by people,
right? So, I'm going to run up to him and I'm

1749
01:37:09,098 --> 01:37:12,725
going to start swinging up the arrows on his chest
and get up to his head.

1750
01:37:12,725 --> 01:37:19,018
MATT: Okay. So you run up, planting a foot on its
thigh, leap in the air, grab onto the arrow that

1751
01:37:19,018 --> 01:37:24,323
Vex left in its chest, whip upward, and while
you're in the air towards its face, go ahead and

1752
01:37:24,395 --> 01:37:25,462
make your attack.

1753
01:37:25,462 --> 01:37:26,885
TALIESIN: Yeah, Legolas.

1754
01:37:26,885 --> 01:37:29,215
MATT: You only get one attack because you used
your bonus action to dash.

1755
01:37:29,215 --> 01:37:33,399
LIAM: Yeah. Never mind. Nine is a 20.

1756
01:37:33,399 --> 01:37:37,013
MATT: You do have advantage on this, if you wish
to roll. You technically have him flanked with the

1757
01:37:37,013 --> 01:37:38,412
other guy.

1758
01:37:38,412 --> 01:37:40,553
LIAM: That's a 26.

1759
01:37:40,553 --> 01:37:41,927
MATT: That hits, definitely.

1760
01:37:41,927 --> 01:37:48,110
LIAM: Yeah, because he's surrounded. All right, so
I'm up on his shoulders at this point. One plus

1761
01:37:48,110 --> 01:37:59,252
seven is eight, plus ten, 11, 16, that's 21, 23.

1762
01:37:59,252 --> 01:38:01,105
MATT: 23 points of damage?

1763
01:38:01,105 --> 01:38:02,766
LIAM: Yeah, with Flametongue.

1764
01:38:02,766 --> 01:38:08,070
MATT: All righty. So as you leap into the air, you
bring the blade, slam into the center of its face,

1765
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:13,140
over one of the eyebrows. It slams into the skull,
and using your weight, you tear down, dragging the

1766
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:18,994
blade across its face. The bone is brittle
underneath its flesh, and it hacks part of its

1767
01:38:18,994 --> 01:38:24,638
face open. The bone and teeth immediately become
visible. Its jaw clenches and actually clamps onto

1768
01:38:24,638 --> 01:38:28,775
your blade as it reaches the bottom of its face
and you catch yourself there for a second, the

1769
01:38:28,775 --> 01:38:33,070
horrible scent of its rotting flesh hitting your
body. You manage to take your foot up, push off,

1770
01:38:33,070 --> 01:38:38,953
pulling the blade out from under its toothy grasp,
and you land on the ground right beside it. Big

1771
01:38:38,953 --> 01:38:42,193
old jagged gash in the side of its face.

1772
01:38:42,193 --> 01:38:43,475
LIAM: Right.

1773
01:38:43,475 --> 01:38:44,324
MATT: Cool.

1774
01:38:44,324 --> 01:38:45,420
LIAM: That's it.

1775
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:48,389
MATT: All right. Now the rest of the guards are
going to go.

1776
01:38:48,389 --> 01:38:50,261
TRAVIS: Guards.

1777
01:38:50,261 --> 01:38:51,990
TALIESIN: Guards.

1778
01:38:51,990 --> 01:38:55,972
MATT: Oh, natural 20. These are the resistance
members.

1779
01:38:55,972 --> 01:38:59,059
TRAVIS: I haven't had a natural 20 in the game.

1780
01:38:59,059 --> 01:39:00,623
LAURA: Ever?

1781
01:39:00,623 --> 01:39:03,325
TRAVIS: In a long time. Except when I head-butted
a fomorian.

1782
01:39:03,325 --> 01:39:06,842
TALIESIN: Would you like to borrow my die and see
if it does anything?

1783
01:39:06,842 --> 01:39:08,216
TRAVIS: No, you keep your Golden Snitch.

1784
01:39:08,216 --> 01:39:09,674
LAURA: I think it's just you.

1785
01:39:09,674 --> 01:39:12,288
SAM: Keep your cheated die all for yourself,
there.

1786
01:39:12,288 --> 01:39:14,575
TRAVIS: Harry Potter.

1787
01:39:14,575 --> 01:39:17,186
MATT: 21 points of damage for the non-criticals.

1788
01:39:17,186 --> 01:39:18,696
TALIESIN: It's hollow.

1789
01:39:18,696 --> 01:39:23,554
LAURA: What is he doing? What's happening over
there?

1790
01:39:23,554 --> 01:39:27,559
MATT: So, all the guards now seeing this opening
and these sudden heroes rushing in to attack it

1791
01:39:27,559 --> 01:39:32,406
use this opening. Some have shortswords, some have
spears. They start jamming them into its sides,

1792
01:39:32,406 --> 01:39:37,494
beginning to take chunks out of it and basically
scraping away its form, its mass that is keeping

1793
01:39:37,494 --> 01:39:40,252
it aloft through this necromantic enchantment.

1794
01:39:40,252 --> 01:39:43,002
That ends their turn. Keyleth, you're up.

1795
01:39:43,002 --> 01:39:45,842
MARISHA: Okay, so you're on him.

1796
01:39:45,842 --> 01:39:47,396
LIAM: I'm not.

1797
01:39:47,396 --> 01:39:50,829
MATT: Landed beside him now, after he pulled the
blade out of its face.

1798
01:39:50,829 --> 01:39:52,881
LIAM: I'm right below his undead dinger.

1799
01:39:52,881 --> 01:39:54,354
MARISHA: But there's a ton of people surrounding
him.

1800
01:39:54,354 --> 01:39:55,491
MATT: Correct.

1801
01:39:55,491 --> 01:39:56,970
SAM: So light him up.

1802
01:39:56,970 --> 01:40:03,171
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to kill everybody if I
start bringing down bolts of lightning. So I'm

1803
01:40:03,171 --> 01:40:10,178
going to move up a little bit, to where I'm within
30 feet of him. Over here or something?

1804
01:40:10,249 --> 01:40:13,361
MATT: That'll put you just at 30 feet.

1805
01:40:13,361 --> 01:40:15,062
MARISHA: Can I see Vax?

1806
01:40:15,062 --> 01:40:18,926
MATT: Yeah, you can barely see Vax. Vax is hard to
see, period, but you can

1807
01:40:18,926 --> 01:40:20,730
barely see Vax at this point.

1808
01:40:20,730 --> 01:40:21,556
MARISHA: Okay.

1809
01:40:21,556 --> 01:40:23,256
LAURA: It's night. He's in black.

1810
01:40:23,256 --> 01:40:27,687
MARISHA: So, looking at the giant and realizing
that if I bring lightning down, I'll just start

1811
01:40:27,687 --> 01:40:35,606
electrocuting everybody around, I meditate for a
second and go super calm and start casting Heat

1812
01:40:35,606 --> 01:40:38,959
Metal, and I start meditating on Vax's daggers.

1813
01:40:38,959 --> 01:40:41,621
MATT: Okay.

1814
01:40:41,621 --> 01:40:47,628
MARISHA: So your daggers are going to do an extra
2d8 damage. And he's up against a wall, correct?

1815
01:40:47,628 --> 01:40:51,984
MATT: He's currently up against the edge of the
temple, yes.

1816
01:40:51,984 --> 01:40:59,114
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to use my bonus. I'm
running fucking low on spells. Fuck, I don't want to

1817
01:40:59,114 --> 01:41:03,425
do it. I'm going to do my bonus action to cast
Grasping Vine.

1818
01:41:03,478 --> 01:41:08,809
MATT: Just so you're aware, Heat Metal does 2d8
damage to him for holding onto it. It doesn't do

1819
01:41:08,809 --> 01:41:09,948
additional damage.

1820
01:41:09,948 --> 01:41:11,385
LIAM: I say we move forward.

1821
01:41:11,385 --> 01:41:12,371
MATT: Okay.

1822
01:41:12,371 --> 01:41:13,640
LAURA: You're going to just take it?

1823
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:16,327
LIAM: It's done. She cast it. Let's go on.

1824
01:41:16,327 --> 01:41:17,788
MATT: Just letting you know for future reference.

1825
01:41:17,788 --> 01:41:22,434
MARISHA: Okay. It's because it worked that way in
Pathfinder. I used to do that with Grog's axe all

1826
01:41:22,434 --> 01:41:23,684
the time.

1827
01:41:23,684 --> 01:41:25,496
SAM: Stupid Pathfinder.

1828
01:41:25,496 --> 01:41:27,085
LAURA: But you also had to touch his axe.

1829
01:41:27,085 --> 01:41:30,839
MATT: So Vax, you immediately take 2d8 points of
fire damage.

1830
01:41:30,839 --> 01:41:32,404
LIAM: Yes sir.

1831
01:41:32,404 --> 01:41:35,817
MATT: And you have to make a constitution saving
throw vs her DC, or you drop

1832
01:41:35,817 --> 01:41:37,198
both of your daggers.

1833
01:41:37,198 --> 01:41:41,223
LIAM: (weak laughter) Okay.

1834
01:41:41,223 --> 01:41:42,713
SAM: It's fun.

1835
01:41:42,713 --> 01:41:43,859
MARISHA: Thanks, Sam.

1836
01:41:43,859 --> 01:41:45,181
TRAVIS: I'm laughing.

1837
01:41:45,181 --> 01:41:46,332
LIAM: What am I doing?

1838
01:41:46,332 --> 01:41:49,589
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw. What's the
DC on your spells?

1839
01:41:49,589 --> 01:41:53,607
MARISHA: My spell save DC? 18.

1840
01:41:53,607 --> 01:41:56,372
LIAM: Fuck a duck, that's hot!

1841
01:41:56,438 --> 01:41:59,718
MATT: Both daggers just drop to the ground. As
they both slam into the mud, (sizzling sound).

1842
01:41:59,718 --> 01:42:06,232
MARISHA: I'm like, yeah. We're going to hurt this
motherfucker so bad.

1843
01:42:06,298 --> 01:42:09,395
MATT: She's not even watching. She's just
concentrating on it.

1844
01:42:09,395 --> 01:42:12,281
And then with your bonus action?

1845
01:42:12,281 --> 01:42:17,125
MARISHA: Bonus action, I'm going to wrap him up
with a Grasping Vine and try to restrain him.

1846
01:42:17,193 --> 01:42:19,488
MATT: Okay, so you open your eyes.

1847
01:42:19,488 --> 01:42:23,604
MARISHA: I'm like, man, I'm such a fucking badass
right now. What am I doing?

1848
01:42:23,604 --> 01:42:25,730
MATT: So you're going to restrain him with a
Grasping Vine.

1849
01:42:25,730 --> 01:42:28,337
MARISHA: Yeah. I think he has to save against it.

1850
01:42:28,337 --> 01:42:34,383
MATT: Yeah, make a dexterity saving throw or be
pulled. It doesn't restrain, it just pulls them

1851
01:42:34,383 --> 01:42:39,830
towards the vine. Since he's already against the
wall, you can pull him away or toward.

1852
01:42:39,830 --> 01:42:41,903
SAM: Nothing you do does what you want it to do.

1853
01:42:41,903 --> 01:42:43,376
MARISHA: Fucking fail.

1854
01:42:43,376 --> 01:42:45,904
MATT: Read the spells! The information's right
there!

1855
01:42:45,904 --> 01:42:47,823
SAM: So you're pulling him towards you?

1856
01:42:47,823 --> 01:42:49,830
LAURA: You can pull him towards the ground, can't
you?

1857
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:52,926
MARISHA: Yeah, can I pull him towards the center
of the earth?

1858
01:42:52,926 --> 01:42:56,348
MATT: Because of his-- sure.

1859
01:42:56,348 --> 01:42:58,833
SAM: That's a no.

1860
01:42:58,833 --> 01:43:04,837
MATT: All right. He fails on the DC. That's a
total of ten. We'll say for the time being, he is

1861
01:43:04,837 --> 01:43:06,440
considered grappled.

1862
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:08,140
SAM: Nice!

1863
01:43:08,140 --> 01:43:09,951
MATT: You did something.

1864
01:43:09,951 --> 01:43:11,213
MARISHA: Thanks, man.

1865
01:43:11,213 --> 01:43:12,317
MATT: You're welcome.

1866
01:43:12,317 --> 01:43:14,996
MARISHA: Man, I'm so cool right now. I'm
concentrating so hard!

1867
01:43:14,996 --> 01:43:18,236
MATT: You finish concentrating, you release the
Grasping Vine, it pulls a little hard to the

1868
01:43:18,236 --> 01:43:23,313
ground. You see its form go (groans). It doesn't
look very happy, and you see Vax going, (gasps).

1869
01:43:23,313 --> 01:43:27,908
There are these little cylinders of steam rising
up from the ground where his daggers are currently

1870
01:43:27,908 --> 01:43:29,123
(sizzling noise).

1871
01:43:29,123 --> 01:43:31,600
MARISHA: And she's like, well, deal with it! It's
going to be awesome!

1872
01:43:31,822 --> 01:43:34,786
MATT: That ends your turn. We're back to the top
of the round. Percy, you're up.

1873
01:43:34,786 --> 01:43:41,594
TALIESIN: I'm pinned and annoyed. I'm shooting him
in the face.

1874
01:43:41,594 --> 01:43:45,477
MATT: Okay, so you're prone.

1875
01:43:45,477 --> 01:43:46,832
TALIESIN: Am I prone?

1876
01:43:46,832 --> 01:43:48,691
MATT: You're prone. The boulder knocked you
prone.

1877
01:43:48,691 --> 01:43:50,541
TALIESIN: Okay, can I use my movement to get up?

1878
01:43:50,541 --> 01:43:52,562
MATT: You can. You get up and use half of your
movement.

1879
01:43:52,562 --> 01:44:02,154
TALIESIN: (grunts) I get up, shake it off, pull up
for another shot. Shooting at his face. I'm

1880
01:44:02,154 --> 01:44:03,487
reloading, shooting at his face.

1881
01:44:03,487 --> 01:44:05,246
MATT: You're reloading and then shooting.

1882
01:44:05,246 --> 01:44:06,478
TRAVIS: Bad News or Pepperbox?

1883
01:44:06,478 --> 01:44:12,179
TALIESIN: Bad News. I'm doing the same thing I was
doing before, so that's eight plus seven.

1884
01:44:12,179 --> 01:44:14,512
15 to hit?

1885
01:44:14,512 --> 01:44:15,804
MATT: 15 does hit.

1886
01:44:15,804 --> 01:44:25,523
TALIESIN: 15 hits, so that's... ugh. That's 20
points of damage.

1887
01:44:25,523 --> 01:44:26,914
MATT: All righty.

1888
01:44:26,914 --> 01:44:31,436
TALIESIN: And now he has disadvantage on his
attacks for the next round.

1889
01:44:31,436 --> 01:44:33,367
MATT: Okay, so this is the headshot?

1890
01:44:33,367 --> 01:44:34,194
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1891
01:44:34,194 --> 01:44:35,096
MATT: Okay.

1892
01:44:35,096 --> 01:44:42,222
TALIESIN: And just because I'm feeling like a
jerk, I'm burning an action surge. Forget it.

1893
01:44:42,222 --> 01:44:45,977
Reloading-- oh, I've actually--

1894
01:44:45,977 --> 01:44:47,799
MATT: You've already used your action surge for
the day.

1895
01:44:47,799 --> 01:44:49,390
TALIESIN: No, it's a short rest.

1896
01:44:49,390 --> 01:44:51,299
MATT: Oh, it is a short rest? Yeah, go for it.

1897
01:44:51,299 --> 01:45:02,220
TALIESIN: I checked. I'm being good. That's 11.
That hits. I'm out of grit points.

1898
01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:04,272
MARISHA: Kill something.

1899
01:45:04,272 --> 01:45:06,946
TALIESIN: 32 points of damage.

1900
01:45:06,946 --> 01:45:08,025
MATT: All right.

1901
01:45:08,025 --> 01:45:09,981
TALIESIN: Reload, fire again.

1902
01:45:09,981 --> 01:45:14,716
That also hits.

1903
01:45:14,771 --> 01:45:23,046
MATT: His AC is eight, by the way. It's a big
heaping pile of hit points. It's not hard to hit.

1904
01:45:23,046 --> 01:45:26,426
TRAVIS: Pile of undead goo.

1905
01:45:26,426 --> 01:45:29,563
MATT: You've attacked it enough that you gather
it's pretty easy to hit.

1906
01:45:29,563 --> 01:45:32,027
TRAVIS: Yeah, there was a 12 and I was like, what?

1907
01:45:32,027 --> 01:45:41,317
TALIESIN: 14, 24, 30 points of damage. And now I'm
going to use my bonus action to heal.

1908
01:45:41,383 --> 01:45:43,400
MATT: All righty. Go for it.

1909
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:53,753
TALIESIN: Heal myself. That's 19 points healed.

1910
01:45:53,753 --> 01:46:02,732
MATT: All right. Now the giant, pieces missing out
of its body, looks around and it reaches down and

1911
01:46:02,732 --> 01:46:10,371
grabs-- yeah, it's going to use one of its attacks
and grab the morningstar, and with

1912
01:46:10,422 --> 01:46:13,890
its second act it's going to swing over towards
you, Vax. You just slammed into

1913
01:46:13,890 --> 01:46:15,109
its face with the dagger.

1914
01:46:15,109 --> 01:46:16,050
TALIESIN: Disadvantage.

1915
01:46:16,050 --> 01:46:17,317
MATT: Yes.

1916
01:46:17,317 --> 01:46:18,524
MARISHA: And he's grappled.

1917
01:46:18,524 --> 01:46:25,830
MATT: An 11 and a one. Grappling just prevents
movement, but yeah, he goes in and swings wide and

1918
01:46:25,830 --> 01:46:30,202
you just duck out of the way, dodge off to the
side. (boosh) It slams and gets stuck in the mud

1919
01:46:30,202 --> 01:46:34,093
and there's a (sucking noise) horrible sucking
sound as it has to pull it out of the ground with

1920
01:46:34,093 --> 01:46:38,423
all of its might. That ends its turn. This giant's
in a bad place. You're up.

1921
01:46:38,423 --> 01:46:40,092
LIAM: What position is it in?

1922
01:46:40,092 --> 01:46:44,387
MATT: It's currently kneeled forward, just pulling
its morningstar out of the mud.

1923
01:46:44,387 --> 01:46:50,554
LIAM: (pants) I reach down and I grab the
scalding-hot daggers again, and I lift them up,

1924
01:46:50,554 --> 01:46:54,137
and lunge and sink into its ribs.

1925
01:46:54,137 --> 01:47:00,491
MATT: Okay. You take 2d8 points of fire damage.
Roll it, Keyleth.

1926
01:47:00,491 --> 01:47:09,586
MARISHA: So does he, right? Because that's kind of
badass. Seven points of damage.

1927
01:47:09,586 --> 01:47:15,551
LIAM: Oh, you roll? Seven or eight, yeah.

1928
01:47:15,551 --> 01:47:23,150
MATT: You pick up the daggers, take the damage,
lift them up to go in for the attack.

1929
01:47:23,150 --> 01:47:24,899
Roll for the attack.

1930
01:47:24,899 --> 01:47:34,350
LIAM: The first one hits. That's a 30. And the
second one is 17. And he's still surrounded, so

1931
01:47:34,350 --> 01:47:45,651
the first one is going to sneak attack his ass.
Two plus three, nine, ten, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17.

1932
01:47:45,651 --> 01:47:47,167
MATT: All right.

1933
01:47:47,167 --> 01:47:51,618
LIAM: 17. On the second attack, Flametongue gets
seven.

1934
01:47:51,618 --> 01:47:53,272
MATT: Seven, okay.

1935
01:47:53,272 --> 01:47:54,998
LAURA: Plus 2d8 for your fire damage.

1936
01:47:54,998 --> 01:47:57,073
LIAM: Oh, plus 2d8 for the fire damage.

1937
01:47:57,073 --> 01:47:59,192
MARISHA: Does he also get the fire damage?

1938
01:47:59,192 --> 01:48:03,026
LIAM: That's a yeah. If I get burned, he gets
burned, right?

1939
01:48:03,026 --> 01:48:08,431
MATT: I'll allow it. That's not usually how the
spell works. I'll allow it for this circumstance.

1940
01:48:08,431 --> 01:48:11,418
Since you're taking the damage to do the attack,
I'll let it happen.

1941
01:48:11,418 --> 01:48:12,724
LIAM: All right. 14.

1942
01:48:12,724 --> 01:48:22,775
MATT: Okay. So, as you're holding the daggers with
the searing pain, you reach up, slash both daggers

1943
01:48:22,775 --> 01:48:27,592
down into the front of its body and you drag
across, you can see its chest breaks open and it

1944
01:48:27,592 --> 01:48:37,696
(groans) stumbles backward, the air expiring from
its throat. (roars) It pushes up against it,

1945
01:48:37,696 --> 01:48:42,543
holding onto that shred of undeath that it
currently has in its body, not falling to your

1946
01:48:42,543 --> 01:48:46,807
measly blows. That ends your turn. Do you want to
move at all?

1947
01:48:46,807 --> 01:48:49,045
LIAM: I didn't move. Can I use a bonus action, at
this point?

1948
01:48:49,045 --> 01:48:50,837
MATT: You used a bonus action for your second
attack.

1949
01:48:50,837 --> 01:48:51,959
LIAM: Second attack? Okay.

1950
01:48:51,959 --> 01:48:54,372
MATT: Yeah, because you're not hasted. All right,
go for it, Vex.

1951
01:48:54,372 --> 01:48:59,592
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to shoot him two times
through my Blazing Bowstring, which I still have

1952
01:48:59,592 --> 01:49:00,795
one left of.

1953
01:49:00,795 --> 01:49:03,571
MATT: First strike will be the Blazing Bowstring?

1954
01:49:03,571 --> 01:49:04,512
LAURA: Yeah.

1955
01:49:04,512 --> 01:49:05,789
MATT: Okay.

1956
01:49:05,789 --> 01:49:10,395
LAURA: That hits. Second one hits, too.

1957
01:49:10,395 --> 01:49:11,787
MATT: All right.

1958
01:49:11,787 --> 01:49:18,270
LAURA: Okay! What's the Blazing Bowstring, again?
1d10, okay.

1959
01:49:18,270 --> 01:49:19,624
LIAM: You've got a lot of papers in there.

1960
01:49:19,624 --> 01:49:30,673
LAURA: I know. I do have a lot of little papers.
Six plus seven is 13, 14, 15, plus fire damage.

1961
01:49:30,673 --> 01:49:37,634
21, plus Hunter's Mark. 22 for the first hit.

1962
01:49:37,634 --> 01:49:39,045
MATT: Hold on.

1963
01:49:39,045 --> 01:49:41,303
LIAM: Get it.

1964
01:49:41,303 --> 01:49:42,524
MATT: How do you want to do this?

1965
01:49:42,524 --> 01:49:44,434
(cheering)

1966
01:49:44,434 --> 01:49:48,604
LAURA: Oh, that feels so good. As he's bent over,
I want to--

1967
01:49:48,604 --> 01:49:49,835
LIAM: You're wearing the shirt, even.

1968
01:49:49,835 --> 01:49:55,028
LAURA: I know! I'm wearing the shirt! As he's bent
over and I just saw my brother attack him with

1969
01:49:55,028 --> 01:50:00,429
fire, I hit him with fire again, straight through
the eyeball that's remaining, through the back of

1970
01:50:00,429 --> 01:50:01,440
his head.

1971
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:04,909
MATT: Okay, so as you release the arrow itself,
you can feel the warmth licking the side of your

1972
01:50:04,909 --> 01:50:09,629
face as the arrow heats up. Release it. It shoots
through the air like a tracer dart, just (arrow

1973
01:50:09,629 --> 01:50:14,639
whizzing). The giant, which is currently reaching
back-- it has a palm out like it's going to try to

1974
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:21,095
palm Vax after the attack. As it reaches up,
(groans) it just (arrow whizzing) into the back of

1975
01:50:21,206 --> 01:50:25,915
the eye, and as it sinks inside its head, (thud)
there's this dull thud sound, like the fire burst

1976
01:50:25,915 --> 01:50:32,007
on the inside of its head. Its other eye
(explosion) plumps out and hangs out the side as

1977
01:50:32,059 --> 01:50:40,664
fire darts out from that open socket. Its jaw goes
slack, and it begins to lurch forward towards you

1978
01:50:40,664 --> 01:50:46,326
and the guy next to it. Both of you guys step back
out of the way as it (moans, thuds) onto the muddy

1979
01:50:46,326 --> 01:50:48,459
ground in front of you.

1980
01:50:48,459 --> 01:50:50,174
LAURA: (pants)

1981
01:50:50,174 --> 01:50:51,671
MATT: Everyone takes a breath for a second.

1982
01:50:51,671 --> 01:50:53,466
LIAM: I start sticking my hands in a puddle.

1983
01:50:53,466 --> 01:50:58,031
LAURA: I run up with Trinket to the guards.

1984
01:50:58,031 --> 01:51:05,377
MARISHA: I go up to start seeing if I can salvage
anything from this giant.

1985
01:51:05,377 --> 01:51:06,679
LIAM: Like my hands?

1986
01:51:06,679 --> 01:51:10,253
MARISHA: Do I see Vax with his hands in the mud?

1987
01:51:10,253 --> 01:51:12,232
MATT: Yes, you see him currently putting out his
hands.

1988
01:51:12,232 --> 01:51:13,871
MARISHA: What did-- what?

1989
01:51:13,871 --> 01:51:15,270
LIAM: Could you fix these?

1990
01:51:15,337 --> 01:51:19,160
MARISHA: Oh. Did it work, though? I'm sorry.

1991
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:21,685
LIAM: Yeah, it worked, it's good, but they sting a
little bit.

1992
01:51:21,685 --> 01:51:26,614
MARISHA: Okay. I put my hands in his hands and
cast Cure Wounds.

1993
01:51:26,678 --> 01:51:27,876
MATT: Okay.

1994
01:51:27,876 --> 01:51:30,382
MARISHA: I'm going to use it from my ring. My
spell-slot ring.

1995
01:51:30,382 --> 01:51:31,665
MATT: What level?

1996
01:51:31,665 --> 01:51:33,403
MARISHA: I'll do level two.

1997
01:51:33,403 --> 01:51:35,682
MATT: Level two? Okay, so 2d8 plus six.

1998
01:51:35,682 --> 01:51:41,683
MARISHA: 12.

1999
01:51:41,683 --> 01:51:43,493
MATT: So you heal 12 hit points.

2000
01:51:43,493 --> 01:51:45,835
LIAM: I heal. I also hold her hands for a second.

2001
01:51:45,835 --> 01:51:48,003
LAURA: I walk through and bust through their
hands.

2002
01:51:48,003 --> 01:51:49,797
TRAVIS: There you go.

2003
01:51:49,797 --> 01:51:51,953
LAURA: I want to talk to the guards.

2004
01:51:51,953 --> 01:51:56,217
MATT: The guards who currently are checking to
make sure it's dead. They're stabbing its body.

2005
01:51:56,267 --> 01:51:59,990
TALIESIN: Putting the guns away and walking over
to the guards, as well.

2006
01:51:59,990 --> 01:52:07,218
MATT: Okay. You notice, they look like guards at
first glance because the armor they're wearing is

2007
01:52:07,218 --> 01:52:12,521
the same type of armor that the guards you've
encountered here wear, but they're all, underneath

2008
01:52:12,570 --> 01:52:17,872
the armor, wearing rags, farmer's clothing,
whatever's available. It's still uniform armor and

2009
01:52:17,872 --> 01:52:20,440
weapon design to anyone who's worked in
Whitestone.

2010
01:52:20,440 --> 01:52:22,032
SAM: Are any of them in berets?

2011
01:52:22,032 --> 01:52:23,647
MATT: You don't know because you're not there.

2012
01:52:23,647 --> 01:52:24,907
SAM: Damn it!

2013
01:52:24,907 --> 01:52:26,307
LIAM: Are they unsullied?

2014
01:52:26,307 --> 01:52:28,122
MATT: (laughs)

2015
01:52:28,122 --> 01:52:31,786
LAURA: I put my hand on one of their shoulders and
say, you showed great bravery here.

2016
01:52:31,837 --> 01:52:36,713
MATT: "Thank you. Thank you for coming and
helping. That got a little hairy there, for a

2017
01:52:36,713 --> 01:52:43,910
"minute. We didn't lose any of our men, thankfully,
and that's thanks to you." He reaches up for a

2018
01:52:43,910 --> 01:52:51,987
second and wipes this black blood stuck to his
chin from the fight. "So. What's next?"

2019
01:52:51,987 --> 01:52:56,299
LAURA: Now we rest up. You heal, and you get ready
to attack tomorrow.

2020
01:52:56,299 --> 01:52:59,035
MATT: "All right. What time?"

2021
01:52:59,035 --> 01:53:01,234
TALIESIN: Tomorrow at dawn, we take the castle.

2022
01:53:01,234 --> 01:53:05,041
MATT: "All right. Men."

2023
01:53:05,041 --> 01:53:06,529
TALIESIN: Spread the word.

2024
01:53:06,529 --> 01:53:07,843
LAURA: Dawn.

2025
01:53:07,843 --> 01:53:13,935
MATT: "Dawn. Dawn it is." Sheathes his weapon. The
other men stand up, and one of them makes one

2026
01:53:13,935 --> 01:53:19,282
final stab into the body of the zombie, like,
"Yeah. Take that." They begin to walk

2027
01:53:19,282 --> 01:53:20,919
back towards town.

2028
01:53:20,919 --> 01:53:26,123
MARISHA: Before he runs off, I tell him, "Tell
everyone to look for the sign of

2029
01:53:26,123 --> 01:53:27,961
"Pelor in the sky."

2030
01:53:27,961 --> 01:53:34,899
MATT: One of them goes, "Pelor. Right." Three of
them run back to the doorway of the temple, and

2031
01:53:34,899 --> 01:53:38,791
they all stop for a second and give a silent
prayer to themselves, and then join the rest of

2032
01:53:38,791 --> 01:53:40,989
their crew as they go walking back towards the
city.

2033
01:53:40,989 --> 01:53:43,345
MARISHA: What time is it right now?

2034
01:53:43,345 --> 01:53:44,808
MATT: Right now? It's hard to tell.

2035
01:53:44,808 --> 01:53:46,912
LAURA: Hopefully, it's a while until dawn.

2036
01:53:46,912 --> 01:53:48,821
MATT: It's about two hours past sunset.

2037
01:53:48,821 --> 01:53:50,366
LAURA: Oh, good. We've got time! That's good.

2038
01:53:50,366 --> 01:53:56,654
LIAM: I pull out my Flametongue dagger and just
look in two or three graves. I don't know if

2039
01:53:56,654 --> 01:53:58,314
there's anything in there.

2040
01:53:58,314 --> 01:54:00,342
SAM: Are you trying to grave rob right now?

2041
01:54:00,342 --> 01:54:02,400
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2042
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:07,547
LIAM: They're empty, man. That is a 15.

2043
01:54:07,547 --> 01:54:09,611
TALIESIN: You're literally going to steal from my
great-grandfather?

2044
01:54:09,611 --> 01:54:10,998
LIAM: I'm just looking.

2045
01:54:10,998 --> 01:54:12,313
TALIESIN: All right.

2046
01:54:12,313 --> 01:54:16,567
MATT: Glancing about, you notice that the coffins
are still there at the bottom, but they're all

2047
01:54:16,567 --> 01:54:24,409
open. The lids are off, and they're empty
entirely. Whatever body is gone. Best you can

2048
01:54:24,409 --> 01:54:31,150
glance about, the most that you can find, most of
them are just laid to rest. One of them seems to

2049
01:54:31,150 --> 01:54:36,824
be laid to rest with what looks to be a nice
ornamental dagger of some kind that's left to

2050
01:54:36,824 --> 01:54:38,450
their side.

2051
01:54:38,450 --> 01:54:39,954
TRAVIS: Fucking do it.

2052
01:54:39,954 --> 01:54:41,392
LAURA AND LIAM: (laugh)

2053
01:54:41,392 --> 01:54:42,505
MARISHA: It could be cursed.

2054
01:54:42,505 --> 01:54:44,024
TRAVIS: Do whatever you want. I'm not here.

2055
01:54:44,024 --> 01:54:45,689
LIAM: Are you giving me morality lessons?

2056
01:54:45,689 --> 01:54:46,810
TRAVIS: I'm not even here.

2057
01:54:46,810 --> 01:54:49,242
TALIESIN: I'm going to check my family grave. The
family crypt.

2058
01:54:49,242 --> 01:54:52,050
MATT: There actually is an undercroft in your
castle.

2059
01:54:52,050 --> 01:54:53,499
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right!

2060
01:54:53,499 --> 01:54:56,154
LIAM: I want to drop down. I'm going to take a
look at that, yeah.

2061
01:54:56,154 --> 01:54:58,242
LAURA: You're going to go get the dagger?

2062
01:54:58,242 --> 01:54:59,354
LIAM: I'm going to look at it.

2063
01:54:59,354 --> 01:55:00,500
LAURA: That ornamental dagger?

2064
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:02,241
MATT: So you leap down into the grave...

2065
01:55:02,241 --> 01:55:03,545
LIAM: Tell me more about that dagger?

2066
01:55:03,545 --> 01:55:08,083
MATT: From what you can see from up there, it just
looks like a fairly nice dagger, it has a little

2067
01:55:08,083 --> 01:55:11,903
like gold sheen to it, and looks like there's gems
encrusted in it from this distance.

2068
01:55:11,903 --> 01:55:13,109
LAURA: All right, go get it.

2069
01:55:13,109 --> 01:55:14,465
(laughter)

2070
01:55:14,465 --> 01:55:15,909
LAURA: It looks shiny.

2071
01:55:15,909 --> 01:55:19,611
MATT: So you leap down into the grave, drop, your
feet hitting against the wooden bottom of the

2072
01:55:19,611 --> 01:55:26,575
coffin. Smells musty and it's been rained in
heavily, so it's not as bad as it could be. It

2073
01:55:26,652 --> 01:55:33,317
looks to be a pretty dagger. You reach for it and
pick it up and look at it, it's lightweight, it's

2074
01:55:33,317 --> 01:55:35,298
ornamental, it's not actually more of a
functional--

2075
01:55:35,298 --> 01:55:37,097
LIAM: I want to make an arcana check.

2076
01:55:37,097 --> 01:55:38,296
LAURA: It's ornamental.

2077
01:55:38,296 --> 01:55:39,601
LIAM: I just want to make an arcana check.

2078
01:55:39,601 --> 01:55:40,493
MATT: Go for it, go for it.

2079
01:55:40,493 --> 01:55:41,435
LIAM: It's a 20.

2080
01:55:41,435 --> 01:55:42,325
MATT: Natural 20?

2081
01:55:42,325 --> 01:55:43,453
LIAM: No. 20.

2082
01:55:43,453 --> 01:55:47,146
MATT: Okay. Take a look at it, there doesn't
appear to be enough of a rune structure even on

2083
01:55:47,146 --> 01:55:55,248
this dagger to give it like a formal enchantment.
It looks ritualistic and ornamental. It's probably

2084
01:55:55,248 --> 01:55:58,344
worth a pretty penny, but it is not a--

2085
01:55:58,344 --> 01:56:00,036
LIAM: I put it down and I pat it and I--

2086
01:56:00,036 --> 01:56:02,446
MATT: Climb back up out of the grave.

2087
01:56:02,446 --> 01:56:03,991
LAURA: He doesn't know!

2088
01:56:03,991 --> 01:56:07,771
MARISHA: Can I salvage anything from the stone
giant?

2089
01:56:07,771 --> 01:56:09,503
LIAM: Tourist, I'm a tourist.

2090
01:56:09,503 --> 01:56:14,901
MATT: Go ahead and make a wisdom check, just roll
a d20, add your six to it.

2091
01:56:14,901 --> 01:56:16,037
MARISHA: Just a wisdom check?

2092
01:56:16,037 --> 01:56:17,335
MATT: Yep.

2093
01:56:17,335 --> 01:56:18,899
MARISHA: 12 total.

2094
01:56:18,899 --> 01:56:22,769
MATT: 12. Looking over the body, this entity and
anything that would be functional on the stone

2095
01:56:22,769 --> 01:56:28,931
giant's body is far rotted and necrosis has taken
hold on a lot of the body parts. Nothing here

2096
01:56:28,931 --> 01:56:32,598
would be of use in any way, shape, or form. Plus
stone giants don't really have any magical

2097
01:56:32,598 --> 01:56:38,735
components to their body, they're just larger
humanoids. What small trophies you could take from

2098
01:56:38,735 --> 01:56:44,130
it, you could sell here and there for a little bit
of change, are also rotted and corroded by its

2099
01:56:44,390 --> 01:56:46,757
undead form that it wouldn't be worth it.

2100
01:56:46,809 --> 01:56:48,954
LIAM: Their teeth are good for 1d8s, though.

2101
01:56:48,954 --> 01:56:51,691
MATT: (laughs) This is true. All right, so what's
the plan?

2102
01:56:51,691 --> 01:56:53,403
LAURA: We should head west.

2103
01:56:53,403 --> 01:56:54,862
MARISHA: Head west, meet up.

2104
01:56:54,862 --> 01:56:56,135
MATT: All right. So you guys--

2105
01:56:56,135 --> 01:56:59,391
LAURA: I take the little bit of Dust of
Tracelessness that we had taken from Grog and I

2106
01:56:59,391 --> 01:57:02,801
try to sprinkle it on our tracks as we go and
cover up our tracks.

2107
01:57:02,801 --> 01:57:06,177
MATT: Okay. As you pull the dust out of your
pouch, you look at it, and it's turned to just

2108
01:57:06,177 --> 01:57:13,532
sand. It seems that the Dust of Tracelessness is
effective when only pulled and used directly out

2109
01:57:13,532 --> 01:57:14,819
of its pouch--

2110
01:57:14,819 --> 01:57:17,394
TRAVIS: By its designated flower girl.

2111
01:57:17,394 --> 01:57:21,677
MATT: If taken out remotely and left on its own
for a while, it becomes magically inert.

2112
01:57:21,833 --> 01:57:25,383
LAURA: Well then, I use my ranger skills to try to
make it look like our tracks are hidden.

2113
01:57:25,383 --> 01:57:30,151
TALIESIN: I know the city well enough to take us
through a relatively--

2114
01:57:30,151 --> 01:57:34,990
MATT: Yes. This is one of those few circumstances
where Percy's almost more helpful than you are as

2115
01:57:34,990 --> 01:57:40,035
far as making your way through. The two of you
together? Very helpful. You guys have been making

2116
01:57:40,035 --> 01:57:45,484
your way through the city, making westward to meet
up with the rest of the party against the wall on

2117
01:57:45,484 --> 01:57:48,287
the western side of Whitestone. And with that,
we're going to go ahead and take a quick bathroom

2118
01:57:48,287 --> 01:57:53,852
break, bring in some snacks. So hang tight, guys,
we'll be back here in just a minute.

2119
01:57:53,852 --> 01:57:55,814
LAURA: I love you, Pike!

2120
01:57:55,892 --> 02:13:20,587
[break]

2121
02:13:20,666 --> 02:13:26,195
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. So. Picking up where
we left off, eventually, the longest-traveling

2122
02:13:26,195 --> 02:13:32,211
group would be the one that went all the way to
the Zenith, the temple of Pelor. Eventually, the

2123
02:13:32,211 --> 02:13:38,785
rain still heavily coming down, you guys keeping
warm and out of the way to the far, far western

2124
02:13:38,785 --> 02:13:45,352
wall, kind of keeping behind a bush. The rest of
the party arrives, the gnomes and goliath

2125
02:13:45,352 --> 02:13:48,422
barbarian waiting for you as you approach.

2126
02:13:48,422 --> 02:13:51,004
(laughter)

2127
02:13:51,004 --> 02:13:53,772
LIAM: Taking your pee break now.

2128
02:13:53,772 --> 02:14:00,663
MATT: So. The rest of you guys gather, what are
you doing? What's your plan?

2129
02:14:00,735 --> 02:14:03,314
TRAVIS: We're against the wall? Should we stay in
the treeline?

2130
02:14:03,390 --> 02:14:04,659
LAURA: We need to hide.

2131
02:14:04,659 --> 02:14:06,397
SAM: How is everyone? Did you defeat your giant?

2132
02:14:06,397 --> 02:14:07,434
LAURA: Totally did.

2133
02:14:07,434 --> 02:14:12,407
SAM: You know who defeated ours? Pike, because
she's the fucking bomb.

2134
02:14:12,407 --> 02:14:14,883
MARISHA: Pike, we've missed you so much.

2135
02:14:14,883 --> 02:14:18,233
SAM: Pike, come here and give me a hug! I give her
a hug. What happens?

2136
02:14:18,233 --> 02:14:24,288
MATT: Okay. (laughs) You go and hug her, and it's
one of those things where because her form, it

2137
02:14:24,288 --> 02:14:29,662
feels like you're grabbing almost a warm,
energetic gelatin in a way, like her form isn't

2138
02:14:29,662 --> 02:14:30,980
purely physical.

2139
02:14:30,980 --> 02:14:34,034
SAM: Just how I remember you! Warm gelatin.

2140
02:14:34,034 --> 02:14:39,733
MATT: And there is this hot wind that wraps around
her and her hair is drifting a little bit. There's

2141
02:14:39,733 --> 02:14:43,285
something, her physical form is very strange
here.

2142
02:14:43,285 --> 02:14:45,950
MARISHA: How did you get here, Pike? How did you
know?

2143
02:14:45,950 --> 02:14:52,704
ASHLEY: Well, as you guys know, I've been working
at the temple and it's been very hard work.

2144
02:14:52,704 --> 02:15:06,704
(laughs) And I, I just, I think about you all
constantly, and every day, I felt a heaviness, and

2145
02:15:06,704 --> 02:15:16,705
I've had these visions of terrible things, and I
felt a disturbance in the Force.

2146
02:15:16,705 --> 02:15:19,136
(laughter)

2147
02:15:19,136 --> 02:15:23,428
ASHLEY: But today, it became too much.

2148
02:15:23,428 --> 02:15:31,469
MATT: You had received a letter from Allura, from
Emon, if you recall.

2149
02:15:31,469 --> 02:15:33,733
ASHLEY: I received a letter!

2150
02:15:33,733 --> 02:15:35,652
(laughter)

2151
02:15:35,652 --> 02:15:44,595
ASHLEY: I received a letter from Allura, and I
felt that you guys-- are you guys making a

2152
02:15:44,595 --> 02:15:49,749
decision or something here in Whitestone?

2153
02:15:49,749 --> 02:16:01,385
SAM: Many decisions. We've decided to take down
this horrible foe, and Percy's been grappling with

2154
02:16:01,385 --> 02:16:03,543
a lot of decisions as we've gone.

2155
02:16:03,543 --> 02:16:05,220
LAURA: Pike, maybe you could help him.

2156
02:16:05,220 --> 02:16:10,189
MARISHA: Yeah, can you take a look at him, Pike? I
believe it's out of my realm of understanding.

2157
02:16:10,189 --> 02:16:16,277
TRAVIS: Actually, Percy's just fine. Maybe she
looks at him after the Briarwoods.

2158
02:16:16,277 --> 02:16:21,463
TALIESIN: Well...

2159
02:16:21,485 --> 02:16:23,426
MARISHA: There was a long pause.

2160
02:16:23,483 --> 02:16:25,152
ASHLEY: That was a very long pause.

2161
02:16:25,152 --> 02:16:27,216
TRAVIS: Percy, how are you feeling?

2162
02:16:27,216 --> 02:16:36,311
TALIESIN: Honestly, if Pike weren't here, I'd say
fine, but... (sighs) How do you think I am, Pike?

2163
02:16:36,311 --> 02:16:45,495
ASHLEY: Well, most of my... my heaviness and
visions were about you.

2164
02:16:45,495 --> 02:16:47,758
TALIESIN: (sighs)

2165
02:16:47,758 --> 02:17:02,891
ASHLEY: I've been in deep prayer and meditation,
and I know you guys were in a very dark place, and

2166
02:17:02,891 --> 02:17:13,752
I prayed that Sarenrae would send me to you. And
so here I am, sort of as an avatar, but I'm here,

2167
02:17:13,752 --> 02:17:22,047
and I want to help in any way that I can. I just
know something's off, and I don't quite know what

2168
02:17:22,047 --> 02:17:23,540
that is yet.

2169
02:17:23,540 --> 02:17:29,213
MATT: Her form shimmers for a second, almost like
the energy that keeps her corporeal in this

2170
02:17:29,213 --> 02:17:34,960
location for a moment flickers, and then she is
restored to her form. You get the sense that--

2171
02:17:34,960 --> 02:17:37,052
MARISHA: This isn't going to last long.

2172
02:17:37,052 --> 02:17:42,775
MATT: That she's not actually physically here.
This divine projection is a channeling of

2173
02:17:42,775 --> 02:17:44,970
Sarenrae's power keeping her here for the moment.

2174
02:17:44,970 --> 02:17:47,479
LAURA: Damn, Sarenrae is really freaking
powerful.

2175
02:17:47,479 --> 02:17:52,644
MARISHA: Yeah, I have a feeling she's probably
using a lot of energy to do this, too. Pike, do

2176
02:17:52,644 --> 02:17:56,609
you know how much longer you can stay in this
form, that you can stay with us?

2177
02:17:56,609 --> 02:18:04,782
ASHLEY: I don't know. This is the first time that
I've ever done this, so I'm hoping that it will

2178
02:18:04,782 --> 02:18:08,577
last a long time, at least to see you through.

2179
02:18:08,577 --> 02:18:09,772
TRAVIS: Oh, us, too.

2180
02:18:09,772 --> 02:18:11,445
LAURA: Us, too.

2181
02:18:11,445 --> 02:18:13,150
ASHLEY: (fake crying)

2182
02:18:13,150 --> 02:18:16,347
TRAVIS: Hey, Pike. Do you want to take Percy's
temperature?

2183
02:18:16,347 --> 02:18:18,851
LAURA: Should we find a place to hide first?

2184
02:18:18,851 --> 02:18:22,346
ASHLEY: Yeah. We're still in the open, right?

2185
02:18:22,346 --> 02:18:28,987
TALIESIN: There's a secret entrance to the castle
to the west, in the woods. I think perhaps if we

2186
02:18:28,987 --> 02:18:30,785
made our way there, we could--

2187
02:18:30,785 --> 02:18:32,092
MARISHA: Get inside?

2188
02:18:32,092 --> 02:18:37,836
TALIESIN: Camp out, perhaps. It would be a roof
over our heads if we got there, and we could take

2189
02:18:37,836 --> 02:18:39,224
care of anyone--

2190
02:18:39,224 --> 02:18:41,456
SAM: Percy's thinking very clearly. He's fine.

2191
02:18:41,513 --> 02:18:43,260
LAURA: He's rubbing his eyes a lot.

2192
02:18:43,260 --> 02:18:45,729
MARISHA: He's had this weird cough for a couple of
days now.

2193
02:18:45,729 --> 02:18:47,381
SAM: He's allergic to cats or something.

2194
02:18:47,381 --> 02:18:49,349
TALIESIN: I'm not allergic to cats.

2195
02:18:49,349 --> 02:18:53,684
LAURA: Pike, he has black smoke coming out of his
body all the time.

2196
02:18:53,684 --> 02:18:55,968
SAM: I have lightning coming out of my ass.

2197
02:18:55,968 --> 02:18:57,832
LAURA: Yeah, well, you choose to do that.

2198
02:18:57,832 --> 02:19:01,846
TALIESIN: Let's make our way to somewhere quiet.

2199
02:19:01,846 --> 02:19:09,142
MARISHA: We'll have her look at you there. I do a
Gust to do that air umbrella thing

2200
02:19:09,142 --> 02:19:10,339
around all of us.

2201
02:19:10,339 --> 02:19:11,524
MATT: That really terrible one that doesn't work
well?

2202
02:19:11,524 --> 02:19:15,067
MARISHA: Yeah, the really terrible one. I'm doing
that to help keep us shielded from the rain.

2203
02:19:15,067 --> 02:19:19,793
MATT: Okay. Are you guys coasting within the
city's walls, or are you moving outside of the

2204
02:19:19,793 --> 02:19:20,938
city's walls?

2205
02:19:21,004 --> 02:19:22,386
LAURA: Outside of the city.

2206
02:19:22,386 --> 02:19:24,180
MATT: Okay. So you find your way a little bit
southward--

2207
02:19:24,180 --> 02:19:25,127
LAURA: Stealthing.

2208
02:19:25,127 --> 02:19:28,852
MATT: Stealthing, to make your way outside of the
city, into the forest surrounding the outskirts of

2209
02:19:28,852 --> 02:19:34,036
Whitestone. Make a stealth check, guys. This is
without the plus ten bonus because you don't have

2210
02:19:34,036 --> 02:19:34,983
any more spells.

2211
02:19:34,983 --> 02:19:36,376
LAURA: I don't.

2212
02:19:36,376 --> 02:19:41,482
TRAVIS: Yeah! Oh. Really? I get plus two to
stealth?

2213
02:19:41,482 --> 02:19:44,849
MATT: Grog?

2214
02:19:44,849 --> 02:19:45,783
TRAVIS: 18.

2215
02:19:45,783 --> 02:19:46,994
LAURA: Ooh. 20.

2216
02:19:46,994 --> 02:19:47,831
LIAM: 23.

2217
02:19:47,831 --> 02:19:48,605
SAM: 12.

2218
02:19:48,605 --> 02:19:49,352
MARISHA: 17.

2219
02:19:49,352 --> 02:19:50,719
TALIESIN: 15 with disadvantage.

2220
02:19:50,719 --> 02:19:51,477
MATT: Okay.

2221
02:19:51,477 --> 02:19:52,381
SAM: And Pike?

2222
02:19:52,381 --> 02:19:54,976
LAURA: Pike, what did you roll for stealth? She's
an apparition!

2223
02:19:54,976 --> 02:19:56,673
ASHLEY: I rolled a ten.

2224
02:19:56,673 --> 02:19:58,407
MATT: You rolled a ten?

2225
02:19:58,407 --> 02:19:59,349
LAURA: Clang!

2226
02:19:59,349 --> 02:20:00,455
ASHLEY: Ten.

2227
02:20:00,455 --> 02:20:01,296
MATT: Okay.

2228
02:20:01,296 --> 02:20:02,785
TALIESIN: Clang, clang, clang.

2229
02:20:02,785 --> 02:20:08,059
MATT: All right. As you guys move into the forest,
the boughs of the trees do help offset some of the

2230
02:20:08,059 --> 02:20:11,759
rain, but there is still some rain making it
through, and there is a heavy drip through the

2231
02:20:11,759 --> 02:20:18,548
leaves you start pushing through. You make your
way out, I'd say a good five minutes to the west

2232
02:20:18,608 --> 02:20:25,481
of the city before you start heading northward,
both Percy and Vex taking lead on this. You, being

2233
02:20:25,481 --> 02:20:28,233
the natural stalker. You, knowing these lands
quite well.

2234
02:20:28,233 --> 02:20:37,976
As Percy presses along, coughing and keeping his
eyes peeled, you press on for about 30 minutes to

2235
02:20:37,976 --> 02:20:46,089
the north. The rain begins to subside a little
bit, and you can hear the occasional (cracking

2236
02:20:46,089 --> 02:20:55,196
noise) sound of these strange growling, cat-like
noises. You know that some of the indigenous

2237
02:20:55,196 --> 02:20:56,779
creatures of the Sierras--

2238
02:20:56,779 --> 02:20:58,463
TALIESIN: Do I know what this sound is?

2239
02:20:58,463 --> 02:21:02,789
MATT: You've heard this before. It's nothing
terribly dangerous. They're just natural cat-like

2240
02:21:02,789 --> 02:21:08,038
creatures that live in the trees. Ocelot-like.
They're indigenous to this region; that's them

2241
02:21:08,038 --> 02:21:15,757
communicating. It's initially off-setting, but you
keep pushing forward. I would have both of you

2242
02:21:15,757 --> 02:21:17,886
guys make survival checks.

2243
02:21:17,886 --> 02:21:19,648
LAURA: (whispering) Survival checks?

2244
02:21:19,648 --> 02:21:21,636
TALIESIN: I don't think I've ever rolled that
before.

2245
02:21:21,636 --> 02:21:23,238
MARISHA: Come on, city boy.

2246
02:21:23,238 --> 02:21:25,127
LAURA: Oh! I have advantage.

2247
02:21:25,127 --> 02:21:27,665
MATT: That's true. And you would have advantage,
actually, because you know this area.

2248
02:21:27,665 --> 02:21:29,279
LAURA: Really? Did that just happen?

2249
02:21:29,279 --> 02:21:31,220
LIAM: Wow. She rolled two threes in a row.

2250
02:21:31,220 --> 02:21:34,268
LAURA: I've got to retire it. It's so beautiful,
and I keep trying it.

2251
02:21:34,268 --> 02:21:37,113
TRAVIS: It's certainly the die, and not you in any
way.

2252
02:21:37,113 --> 02:21:40,433
LAURA: It's just been punishing me, as of late.

2253
02:21:40,433 --> 02:21:41,411
TALIESIN: 14.

2254
02:21:41,411 --> 02:21:42,318
MATT: 14? Okay.

2255
02:21:42,318 --> 02:21:43,367
LAURA: Ten.

2256
02:21:43,367 --> 02:21:48,202
MATT: The two of you, working together on this--
it takes you an hour or so before you eventually

2257
02:21:48,202 --> 02:21:53,747
get further enough north and out of the outskirts
of Whitestone where you begin to see the rising

2258
02:21:53,747 --> 02:22:00,866
platform, the small central forest mesa that the
castle Whitestone is built upon. You can see,

2259
02:22:00,866 --> 02:22:07,069
through the heavy cloud cover, what little bit of torch
light is visible from some of the castle interior

2260
02:22:07,069 --> 02:22:13,599
in the distance. It's this ominous dark shape
outlined against the cloud cover above you.

2261
02:22:13,599 --> 02:22:21,959
LIAM: On that walk, while they're leading the way,
I quietly walk alongside Pike and fill her in on

2262
02:22:21,959 --> 02:22:28,061
everything I have seen happen with Percival: the
smoke coming out of him, the darker turn in his

2263
02:22:28,061 --> 02:22:33,167
personality, the way that he branded that man.
Everything that I am worried about.

2264
02:22:33,167 --> 02:22:34,320
SAM: The cough.

2265
02:22:34,320 --> 02:22:37,753
LIAM: The cough. Everything, so that she's filled
in on his darker turn.

2266
02:22:37,753 --> 02:22:39,923
MATT: Okay. Did you get that, Ashley?

2267
02:22:39,923 --> 02:22:41,116
ASHLEY: I did.

2268
02:22:41,116 --> 02:22:48,332
MATT: So, pressing on, eventually catching the
edge of that mountain. That, to you, is the

2269
02:22:48,332 --> 02:22:52,183
inclination; you know this area very well,
spending most of your time living around this

2270
02:22:52,183 --> 02:22:57,461
castle. You gesture for the rest of the group to
follow you up towards the edge of this central

2271
02:22:57,461 --> 02:23:02,255
mountain platform that the castle's upon.
Eventually, coasting along the side-- I want you

2272
02:23:02,255 --> 02:23:04,739
to make an investigation check, Percy.

2273
02:23:04,739 --> 02:23:09,450
TALIESIN: 16?

2274
02:23:09,450 --> 02:23:17,581
MATT: 16? Okay. Pushing forward, you spend a good
20 minutes walking back and forth. You're pretty

2275
02:23:17,581 --> 02:23:25,535
sure that this is where the entrance is, and
looking along this area, you make your way to the

2276
02:23:25,535 --> 02:23:33,769
northern side of this mountain. No entrance seems
to be appearing to you. There's no opening.

2277
02:23:33,769 --> 02:23:39,758
There's no doorway. It was a cavern exit that was
loosely hidden by a series of bushes that were

2278
02:23:39,758 --> 02:23:41,215
clustered around it.

2279
02:23:41,215 --> 02:23:42,745
TALIESIN: It should be around here.

2280
02:23:42,745 --> 02:23:46,729
LAURA: Can I start taking a look around and 
see if I see anything?

2281
02:23:46,729 --> 02:23:48,274
LIAM: All of us, yeah.

2282
02:23:48,336 --> 02:23:52,944
TRAVIS: We should be very careful. These two are
good at using their brain muscles. Could be an

2283
02:23:52,944 --> 02:23:54,311
ambush.

2284
02:23:54,311 --> 02:23:57,371
LIAM: 26 on perception.

2285
02:23:57,371 --> 02:24:01,023
LAURA: That's way better than mine. 17.

2286
02:24:01,023 --> 02:24:07,271
MATT: Okay. About ten minutes of you guys
searching as you travel southward among this...

2287
02:24:07,271 --> 02:24:15,996
okay. You guys watch along the wall, and nothing
seems to be catching your eye. You notice that

2288
02:24:15,996 --> 02:24:23,335
there's a portion of the mountainside that is
looser rock. Everything here is solid, long-eroded

2289
02:24:23,335 --> 02:24:30,035
through weather and time. There is one section
that appears to have more of a crumbly, loose rock

2290
02:24:30,035 --> 02:24:32,448
that forms the lower portion of the wall.

2291
02:24:32,448 --> 02:24:33,708
LIAM: Big guy, come here.

2292
02:24:33,708 --> 02:24:34,775
TRAVIS: What?

2293
02:24:34,775 --> 02:24:40,661
LIAM: This is new. These haven't been here long.
I'm not very strong; do you

2294
02:24:40,661 --> 02:24:41,997
want to start hucking rocks?

2295
02:24:41,997 --> 02:24:43,720
TRAVIS: Wait, say that again?

2296
02:24:43,720 --> 02:24:49,697
LIAM: I am extremely fast and nimble and could
totally fuck you up, but I can't lift that much,

2297
02:24:49,697 --> 02:24:54,315
including door jambs. Could you help me move these
rocks?

2298
02:24:54,315 --> 02:24:57,270
TRAVIS: I suppose. I go and I start moving
rocks.

2299
02:24:57,495 --> 02:24:59,200
LIAM: You look very handsome in that beard.

2300
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:01,424
MATT: Okay. Make an athletics check.

2301
02:25:01,424 --> 02:25:04,022
MARISHA: (laughs) Oh shit.

2302
02:25:04,022 --> 02:25:08,610
TRAVIS: Never forget. 18.

2303
02:25:08,610 --> 02:25:14,428
MATT: 18, okay. You go over and start pulling the
rocks away. A lot of the ones at the very surface

2304
02:25:14,428 --> 02:25:18,515
are pretty small and you're pushing them aside and
rolling off. Eventually, you start getting to the

2305
02:25:18,515 --> 02:25:24,384
base of this area and you can see now, there are a
cluster of bushes that have long died and are

2306
02:25:24,434 --> 02:25:26,029
crushed under these rocks.

2307
02:25:26,029 --> 02:25:28,087
TALIESIN: Does this look familiar to me?

2308
02:25:28,087 --> 02:25:32,341
MATT: This would be similar to the placement of
where the bushes were that originally obscured the

2309
02:25:32,341 --> 02:25:34,101
crawlspace that led into this tunnel.

2310
02:25:34,101 --> 02:25:36,267
TALIESIN: I think this might be it.

2311
02:25:36,267 --> 02:25:37,879
LAURA: Well, what happened here?

2312
02:25:37,879 --> 02:25:39,409
SAM: Did they blow it?

2313
02:25:39,409 --> 02:25:42,111
LAURA: Does it look like a cave-in, like somebody
did it on purpose?

2314
02:25:42,111 --> 02:25:46,216
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see if this is
natural or man-done?

2315
02:25:46,216 --> 02:25:47,646
MATT: Sure. Go for it.

2316
02:25:47,646 --> 02:25:48,826
SAM: "Man-done."

2317
02:25:48,826 --> 02:25:54,138
MARISHA: I think that's a 21.

2318
02:25:54,138 --> 02:25:55,203
MATT: 21?

2319
02:25:55,203 --> 02:25:56,237
MARISHA: Yeah, 21.

2320
02:25:56,237 --> 02:26:02,448
MATT: Inspecting this, the pattern in which it
fell was very localized, which leads you to

2321
02:26:02,448 --> 02:26:03,578
believe--

2322
02:26:03,578 --> 02:26:05,265
MARISHA: I think this was blasted down.

2323
02:26:05,265 --> 02:26:09,779
MATT: Yeah, this was blasted or was intentionally
done to demolish this exit as opposed to a natural

2324
02:26:09,779 --> 02:26:13,887
fall. At this point in time, you've pulled through
a few of the larger rocks, and you roll them over

2325
02:26:13,887 --> 02:26:15,749
and you do reveal a small tunnel.

2326
02:26:15,749 --> 02:26:17,719
TRAVIS: Hey, look! I found a hole.

2327
02:26:17,719 --> 02:26:20,096
MARISHA: Good work, Grog.

2328
02:26:20,096 --> 02:26:22,929
MATT: About 15 minutes of pushing this stuff out
of the way before you eventually find it, and it's

2329
02:26:22,929 --> 02:26:24,475
probably a good ten feet inward.

2330
02:26:24,475 --> 02:26:26,020
SAM: Can we get in it?

2331
02:26:26,020 --> 02:26:28,885
MATT: It's tight, but you can start moving in
there.

2332
02:26:28,885 --> 02:26:30,596
LIAM: Scanlan, squish in there.

2333
02:26:30,596 --> 02:26:33,361
SAM: Well, we have two gnomes with us.

2334
02:26:33,361 --> 02:26:36,273
LIAM: She'll light up the hole.

2335
02:26:36,273 --> 02:26:39,577
SAM: I hope so.

2336
02:26:39,577 --> 02:26:41,521
(laughter)

2337
02:26:41,521 --> 02:26:51,127
SAM: I will shimmy in, just to see what's down
there.

2338
02:26:51,127 --> 02:27:00,964
MATT: Okay. You make your way into this lower
tunnel. A bit sharp in there. Black as night; no

2339
02:27:00,964 --> 02:27:08,938
light source. The ground itself is very dry, which
is a nice change from the rather wet exterior

2340
02:27:08,988 --> 02:27:19,140
awaiting you outside. It generally smells musty
and seems disused. And very dark.

2341
02:27:19,140 --> 02:27:23,236
LIAM: I lean down and say, does it look like
somewhere that we can rest for the night?

2342
02:27:23,236 --> 02:27:25,801
SAM: Oi! I can't see anything.

2343
02:27:25,801 --> 02:27:27,311
(laughter)

2344
02:27:27,311 --> 02:27:29,797
SAM: You got a torch up there, or something?

2345
02:27:29,797 --> 02:27:35,837
LIAM: I flip my Flametongue dagger over backwards
and hand it to him through this little hole.

2346
02:27:35,837 --> 02:27:37,468
MATT: Okay. You take the dagger.

2347
02:27:37,468 --> 02:27:40,140
SAM: This feels so cool. It's like a shortsword
for me!

2348
02:27:40,140 --> 02:27:41,960
(laughter)

2349
02:27:41,960 --> 02:27:45,490
MATT: With the flickering light along the blade,
it lights up the area. The tunnel widens up to

2350
02:27:45,490 --> 02:27:53,984
roughly eight to ten feet wide and seems to curl
forward before disappearing around a gradual edge

2351
02:27:53,984 --> 02:27:59,169
about 50 feet ahead of you. It's about six feet
tall, so the taller of you folk are going to have

2352
02:27:59,169 --> 02:28:04,531
to crouch in, but it's about six feet tall, about
eight to ten feet wide, and that continues to curl

2353
02:28:04,531 --> 02:28:07,328
deeper in towards the mountain.

2354
02:28:07,328 --> 02:28:12,518
SAM: No one down here, but I don't know how far
this thing goes, and I don't know how well it's

2355
02:28:12,518 --> 02:28:14,045
guarded.

2356
02:28:14,045 --> 02:28:15,582
TRAVIS: Are there trees around us?

2357
02:28:15,582 --> 02:28:20,808
MATT: Yeah. No more than maybe five feet off this
mountain line, the forest grows immediately

2358
02:28:20,808 --> 02:28:21,981
dense.

2359
02:28:21,981 --> 02:28:24,410
MARISHA: If they've blasted in the entrance, I
have a feeling--

2360
02:28:24,410 --> 02:28:26,088
TALIESIN: I don't think they're expecting anyone
from here.

2361
02:28:26,088 --> 02:28:27,340
MARISHA: They're not expecting people.

2362
02:28:27,340 --> 02:28:31,067
LIAM: This was taken care of, in their minds. I
say we squeeze Grog and Trinket in here.

2363
02:28:31,067 --> 02:28:32,478
SAM: And camp in the tunnel?

2364
02:28:32,478 --> 02:28:35,346
LIAM: Yeah. I'll go ahead a bit and take a quick
peeky-poo.

2365
02:28:35,346 --> 02:28:38,207
TRAVIS: You don't think they'll patrol this area?

2366
02:28:38,207 --> 02:28:39,286
LIAM: No.

2367
02:28:39,286 --> 02:28:41,861
LAURA: Does it seem like there's cobwebs? Does it
seem dusty and disused?

2368
02:28:41,861 --> 02:28:43,885
MATT: If you crawl inside to look...

2369
02:28:43,885 --> 02:28:45,591
MARISHA: Are we inside? Let's all crawl in.

2370
02:28:45,591 --> 02:28:50,272
MATT: As you guys all may your way inside,
glancing about-- make an investigation check.

2371
02:28:50,272 --> 02:28:51,677
MARISHA: I light up my hands.

2372
02:28:51,677 --> 02:28:59,988
SAM: I put Vax's dagger in my back pocket. Cover
it up with my shirt.

2373
02:28:59,988 --> 02:29:01,921
MATT: Okay. Make a sleight-of-hand check.

2374
02:29:01,921 --> 02:29:03,276
LAURA: 20.

2375
02:29:03,276 --> 02:29:07,197
MATT: Okay. Yeah, there's been no footsteps in
here for quite some time.

2376
02:29:07,197 --> 02:29:08,641
SAM: Seven.

2377
02:29:08,641 --> 02:29:13,429
LAURA: This has definitely been disused. Disused?
Is that a good word?

2378
02:29:13,429 --> 02:29:14,712
TALIESIN: Abandoned.

2379
02:29:14,712 --> 02:29:16,244
LAURA: "Abandoned" is a better word.

2380
02:29:16,244 --> 02:29:19,269
MATT: As she's saying this, you look over and
Scanlan almost looks at you directly and goes

2381
02:29:19,269 --> 02:29:23,989
like-- He grabs your wrist and stops you.

2382
02:29:23,989 --> 02:29:27,720
LIAM: I use the other hand and I tweak his nose as
hard as I can.

2383
02:29:27,720 --> 02:29:29,386
SAM: Not in front of Pike!

2384
02:29:29,386 --> 02:29:31,940
(laughter)

2385
02:29:31,940 --> 02:29:34,089
MATT: Dagger's retrieved.

2386
02:29:34,089 --> 02:29:40,186
TALIESIN: Pike, can you take a look at this cough
before we take a rest?

2387
02:29:40,186 --> 02:29:41,873
MARISHA: Yeah, take a look at him, Pike.

2388
02:29:41,873 --> 02:29:42,970
TRAVIS: Are we in the tunnel?

2389
02:29:42,970 --> 02:29:44,233
MATT: You're in the tunnel right now.

2390
02:29:44,233 --> 02:29:49,719
TRAVIS: I grab some of the boulders and cover up
the way we came in. Or just a boulder, and move it

2391
02:29:49,719 --> 02:29:51,660
to the mouth of it. Or is it too big?

2392
02:29:51,660 --> 02:29:55,629
MATT: You can move a few. There's no boulders
quite large enough to fully close it off. You can

2393
02:29:55,629 --> 02:29:57,398
do it; it will take you a little bit of time, but
you can do it.

2394
02:29:57,398 --> 02:29:59,123
TRAVIS: Yeah, just to cover it up a little.

2395
02:29:59,123 --> 02:30:00,420
MATT: Okay.

2396
02:30:00,420 --> 02:30:03,751
ASHLEY: Are there two openings? The one that we
came in, and then the rest of the tunnel?

2397
02:30:03,796 --> 02:30:07,440
MATT: The tunnel continues and curves out of
sight, about 50 feet in.

2398
02:30:07,440 --> 02:30:09,539
LAURA: But we blocked up the one we came through.

2399
02:30:09,539 --> 02:30:13,764
TRAVIS: Oh, Keyleth? Can you make a fucking bush
grow in front of this thing?

2400
02:30:13,764 --> 02:30:17,135
LAURA: Or can you put up a wall to where we don't
have to worry?

2401
02:30:17,135 --> 02:30:21,087
TRAVIS: So if whoever was going by with those dogs
while we were up in the trees the first night we

2402
02:30:21,087 --> 02:30:23,658
got here comes by and sees a hole in the wall...

2403
02:30:23,658 --> 02:30:26,194
MARISHA: Okay.

2404
02:30:26,194 --> 02:30:28,038
TALIESIN: How many spells do you have left?

2405
02:30:28,038 --> 02:30:31,824
MARISHA: (sighs) That's the question. It depends
on if we're going to decide to--

2406
02:30:31,824 --> 02:30:33,587
TALIESIN: I think we should take a rest.

2407
02:30:33,587 --> 02:30:34,827
LAURA: We have to rest, yes.

2408
02:30:34,827 --> 02:30:36,111
MARISHA: I'll think about it.

2409
02:30:36,111 --> 02:30:36,981
LAURA: Okay.

2410
02:30:36,981 --> 02:30:38,198
MATT: Okay.

2411
02:30:38,198 --> 02:30:44,566
ASHLEY: Could I put a Guardian of Faith above us
before we make our--

2412
02:30:44,566 --> 02:30:46,429
SAM: Of course you can.

2413
02:30:46,429 --> 02:30:47,927
MATT: Let's see how long that lasts for.

2414
02:30:47,927 --> 02:30:48,917
TRAVIS: A what?

2415
02:30:48,917 --> 02:30:51,101
LAURA: A what?

2416
02:30:51,173 --> 02:30:52,846
MATT: Yeah, it lasts for eight hours.

2417
02:30:52,846 --> 02:30:55,144
LIAM: We came to a land of evil without--

2418
02:30:55,144 --> 02:30:56,178
MATT: Yes, you can.

2419
02:30:56,178 --> 02:30:58,131
LAURA: I can't believe we came without Pike,
ever.

2420
02:30:58,131 --> 02:30:59,320
ASHLEY: I'm sorry.

2421
02:30:59,320 --> 02:31:01,134
LAURA: Pike, stay with us forever.

2422
02:31:01,134 --> 02:31:02,777
ASHLEY: Okay.

2423
02:31:02,777 --> 02:31:04,885
LIAM: Or at least through next week.

2424
02:31:04,885 --> 02:31:10,946
MATT: All right, so as you guys are having this
conversation, Pike grabs her holy symbol for a

2425
02:31:10,946 --> 02:31:16,219
second, closes her eyes, and focuses, and the
energy around her, that slightly drifting,

2426
02:31:16,219 --> 02:31:23,070
ethereal divine energy, seems to shift away from
her for a second and then coalesce into what looks

2427
02:31:23,101 --> 02:31:30,810
like a floating, ghostly, armored entity that
apparates in the air beside her. Her form once

2428
02:31:31,027 --> 02:31:35,874
again becomes whole, and she looks towards it and
gives it a nod, and the armored entity seems to

2429
02:31:35,874 --> 02:31:41,359
acknowledge with a strange head nod and then turns
towards the inner side of the tunnel and begins

2430
02:31:41,359 --> 02:31:44,547
patrolling a small section of the tunnel on its
own.

2431
02:31:44,547 --> 02:31:46,512
LAURA: Wow. Well, there you go.

2432
02:31:46,512 --> 02:31:47,568
ASHLEY: Okay.

2433
02:31:47,568 --> 02:31:50,699
LIAM: I think to myself, oh, that is badass.

2434
02:31:50,758 --> 02:31:52,602
(laughter)

2435
02:31:52,602 --> 02:31:58,020
LAURA: I smack her on her little gelatin back and
say, good work, Pike.

2436
02:31:58,020 --> 02:32:08,592
ASHLEY: (laughs) I go over to Percy. Percy, how
are you?

2437
02:32:08,592 --> 02:32:19,594
TALIESIN: I don't know. I've had a cough, and
I'm... complicated.

2438
02:32:19,594 --> 02:32:25,732
MARISHA: I did a check on him, Pike. His cough
doesn't seem to be anything natural or

2439
02:32:25,732 --> 02:32:33,499
disease-related, so it's nothing like a fever. Not
a real one, anyway.

2440
02:32:33,499 --> 02:32:40,768
ASHLEY: Oh boy. Okay. Can I do any extra check
on him?

2441
02:32:40,768 --> 02:32:42,188
TRAVIS: Yep. Drop your pants.

2442
02:32:42,188 --> 02:32:45,133
MATT: You can make a medicine check on him.

2443
02:32:45,133 --> 02:32:47,791
LIAM: You're getting the radiant digit.

2444
02:32:47,791 --> 02:32:50,337
ASHLEY: Did anybody already do a medicine check?

2445
02:32:50,337 --> 02:32:53,037
MATT: You haven't made one.

2446
02:32:53,037 --> 02:32:55,072
ASHLEY: All right. I'll give it a go.

2447
02:32:55,072 --> 02:32:59,172
MARISHA: (quietly) Come on, Pike.

2448
02:32:59,172 --> 02:33:02,196
ASHLEY: 17.

2449
02:33:02,196 --> 02:33:07,837
MATT: 17? Okay. You take a moment to inspect
Percy, looking at his features, checking his

2450
02:33:07,837 --> 02:33:16,984
pulse, and generally getting a sense of his life
force in general. His eyes are sunken, his jowls

2451
02:33:16,984 --> 02:33:24,474
are shadowed. From what you recall of Percy, he
was always a seemingly-healthy, if on the thin and

2452
02:33:24,474 --> 02:33:30,841
pale side, individual. Doubly more so than you've
ever seen him. There is an unrest to his energy,

2453
02:33:30,841 --> 02:33:39,153
and there is no physical, natural illness or
discernible disease, but there is something

2454
02:33:39,153 --> 02:33:42,481
unsettling about his presence that you've never
sensed before.

2455
02:33:42,481 --> 02:33:56,770
ASHLEY: (sighs) Okay. Lesser Restoration, would
that do anything in this situation?

2456
02:33:56,770 --> 02:33:58,403
LAURA: What about Greater Restoration?

2457
02:33:58,403 --> 02:34:00,542
MATT: You can try it. Lesser or Greater
Restoration.

2458
02:34:00,542 --> 02:34:05,022
MARISHA: If you have a Greater Restoration, Pike--
I don't have it on me.

2459
02:34:05,022 --> 02:34:10,863
ASHLEY: Okay. I can try it. Can I try it?

2460
02:34:10,863 --> 02:34:12,100
MATT: Yeah, if you want to.

2461
02:34:12,100 --> 02:34:14,053
ASHLEY: Okay.

2462
02:34:14,053 --> 02:34:16,243
MATT: So what are you casting? Lesser or Greater
Restoration?

2463
02:34:16,243 --> 02:34:19,262
ASHLEY: I'll do Greater. Do you mind, Percy?

2464
02:34:19,262 --> 02:34:21,341
TALIESIN: No. (sighs) No.

2465
02:34:21,341 --> 02:34:25,686
MATT: Okay, so Pike reaches up. You grab his face
again, and you close your eyes and concentrate.

2466
02:34:25,686 --> 02:34:33,874
Her hands begin to glow with an extremely bright
vibrance, even moreso than her gently luminescent

2467
02:34:33,874 --> 02:34:38,250
form right now. It's almost like there's a
blowtorch of radiant energy right around his jaw.

2468
02:34:38,250 --> 02:34:43,081
The rest of her form almost seems to put so much
energy into it that her legs begin to dissipate

2469
02:34:43,081 --> 02:34:47,769
and vanish, almost like she's putting all of her
energy into this moment, the rest of her body

2470
02:34:47,769 --> 02:34:49,928
fading into the grasp.

2471
02:34:49,928 --> 02:34:54,577
You feel this warmth wash through your entire
body, and for a brief moment, for the first time

2472
02:34:54,577 --> 02:34:59,576
in a number of weeks, there's a moment of serenity
to you. Your eyes instinctually close, and for a

2473
02:34:59,576 --> 02:35:04,716
second, you feel like you're standing next to Pike
in a void of darkness.

2474
02:35:04,716 --> 02:35:12,168
As that warmth hits, Pike, you sense something
there. You sense a seed of darkness. There's

2475
02:35:12,168 --> 02:35:20,106
something in him that you can almost reach out and
grasp, and in that imaginative space, you do. You

2476
02:35:20,106 --> 02:35:25,173
thrust your hand out and grab onto it, and it's
taut, and it's fighting, but you pull and wrest

2477
02:35:25,236 --> 02:35:31,231
it forth, and as you do, you feel it burn and
dissipate. At which point, both of you guys open

2478
02:35:31,231 --> 02:35:36,687
your eyes, breathe in succession with each other.
The energy fades from your hands and your form

2479
02:35:36,687 --> 02:35:41,053
goes back to its full, radiant physicality.

2480
02:35:41,053 --> 02:35:42,799
You can remove a corruption point from yourself.

2481
02:35:42,799 --> 02:35:43,740
SAM: Ooh!

2482
02:35:43,740 --> 02:35:44,933
LAURA: Yay!

2483
02:35:44,933 --> 02:35:46,028
MARISHA: A corruption point?

2484
02:35:46,028 --> 02:35:46,926
MATT: Yes.

2485
02:35:46,926 --> 02:35:48,177
SAM: He had two.

2486
02:35:48,177 --> 02:35:49,556
LAURA: Okay.

2487
02:35:49,556 --> 02:35:53,295
MATT: He's still looking a little sickly, but
definitely improved.

2488
02:35:53,295 --> 02:35:54,927
TALIESIN: Did I heal, as well?

2489
02:35:54,927 --> 02:35:56,893
MATT: No, you just lose a corruption point.

2490
02:35:56,893 --> 02:36:01,963
MARISHA: So does that get rid of one of his weird
ailments?

2491
02:36:01,963 --> 02:36:03,434
SAM: He still coughs.

2492
02:36:03,434 --> 02:36:05,122
TALIESIN: I do feel better.

2493
02:36:05,122 --> 02:36:06,729
MATT: The cough is still there.

2494
02:36:06,729 --> 02:36:14,154
LIAM: I watched all of that, and when I saw him
lean back into the earthen wall, I quietly back up

2495
02:36:14,154 --> 02:36:20,082
and I'm going to go down the tunnel, like 50 feet,
and see--

2496
02:36:20,082 --> 02:36:21,483
MATT: Roll a stealth check.

2497
02:36:21,483 --> 02:36:23,703
SAM: Pike, that was incredible.

2498
02:36:23,703 --> 02:36:25,926
LIAM: 23.

2499
02:36:25,926 --> 02:36:29,749
ASHLEY: What is a corruption point?

2500
02:36:29,749 --> 02:36:35,282
MATT: You have no idea what a corruption point is,
but you removed some point of corruption

2501
02:36:35,282 --> 02:36:36,777
in his body.

2502
02:36:36,858 --> 02:36:40,083
TRAVIS: Can you do me next? My neck has been
hurting for weeks.

2503
02:36:40,083 --> 02:36:41,811
ASHLEY: (laughs)

2504
02:36:41,811 --> 02:36:44,870
LAURA: I do that to Grog. How's that feel? How's
that feel, big guy?

2505
02:36:44,870 --> 02:36:46,798
TRAVIS: Oh, it's much better.

2506
02:36:46,798 --> 02:36:51,573
MATT: Almost like a small seed of sentient tumor,
you removed from him.

2507
02:36:51,573 --> 02:36:55,085
TALIESIN: Should I randomize which corruption
point vanishes?

2508
02:36:55,085 --> 02:36:56,757
MATT: It's a compounding thing.

2509
02:36:56,757 --> 02:36:57,830
TALIESIN: Oh, it's compounding.

2510
02:36:57,830 --> 02:36:59,246
MATT: Yeah. They're not specific.

2511
02:36:59,246 --> 02:37:01,339
ASHLEY: How many do you have?

2512
02:37:01,339 --> 02:37:05,651
MATT: You don't know. You have no idea.

2513
02:37:05,651 --> 02:37:08,139
ASHLEY: Sorry. I'm asking too many questions.

2514
02:37:08,139 --> 02:37:09,968
MATT: Yeah. How dare you? No, it's fine.

2515
02:37:09,968 --> 02:37:11,869
ASHLEY: How do you feel, Percy?

2516
02:37:11,869 --> 02:37:16,216
TALIESIN: I feel better. I feel more like myself.
(coughs)

2517
02:37:16,216 --> 02:37:18,319
LAURA: But he's still coughing.

2518
02:37:18,319 --> 02:37:23,367
TALIESIN: I'm still coughing, but I feel much
better. Thank you.

2519
02:37:23,367 --> 02:37:26,147
MARISHA: What did you just do to him, Pike?

2520
02:37:26,147 --> 02:37:33,376
ASHLEY: I just tried to find out what this is.
This is going to sound like a very weird question,

2521
02:37:33,376 --> 02:37:37,965
but does part of you want to hold onto some of
this?

2522
02:37:37,965 --> 02:37:48,460
TALIESIN: It could be. I'm not quite finished yet.
We'll see where we are tomorrow.

2523
02:37:48,513 --> 02:37:50,664
ASHLEY: Okay.

2524
02:37:50,664 --> 02:37:56,842
MATT: While this is happening, Vax has vanished
ahead into the tunnel on his own. You guys look

2525
02:37:56,842 --> 02:37:59,380
around and realize that he's nowhere to be seen.

2526
02:37:59,380 --> 02:38:00,962
TRAVIS: Fuck him. I go to sleep.

2527
02:38:00,962 --> 02:38:03,761
(laughter)

2528
02:38:03,761 --> 02:38:11,077
MATT: Okay. Vax, pushing ahead. Thankfully, in the
darkness, you have a little bit of vision, limited

2529
02:38:11,077 --> 02:38:12,214
as it is.

2530
02:38:12,214 --> 02:38:13,625
LIAM: From the glowing gnome?

2531
02:38:13,625 --> 02:38:18,881
MATT: Make a perception check. As you turn around
the corner, you lose the light source.

2532
02:38:18,881 --> 02:38:20,646
LIAM: 20.

2533
02:38:20,646 --> 02:38:26,285
MATT: Okay. You continue around the edge, and the
tunnel evens out for a bit and then goes straight,

2534
02:38:26,285 --> 02:38:31,371
and then curves again to the left. Following that,
it curves again to the right. You can keep going,

2535
02:38:31,371 --> 02:38:34,468
or you can head back. You've traversed about 60 or
70 feet in this tunnel.

2536
02:38:34,468 --> 02:38:37,158
LIAM: 60 or 70 feet? I'm going to go another 60 or
70 feet.

2537
02:38:37,158 --> 02:38:38,265
SAM: Yeah!

2538
02:38:38,265 --> 02:38:41,265
LAURA: Where the fuck are you?

2539
02:38:41,265 --> 02:38:47,603
MATT: You keep pushing towards this tunnel and
turn to the right. You travel a bit further

2540
02:38:47,603 --> 02:38:54,765
forward, and as the tunnel makes another sharp
right turn, you see all of a sudden where the dirt

2541
02:38:54,765 --> 02:39:00,672
stops and there is solid, smooth stonework: a
broken portion of what looks like the back side of

2542
02:39:00,672 --> 02:39:07,387
a wall of some kind. You see nothing beyond it. It
looks like there is a piece of stone something

2543
02:39:07,387 --> 02:39:10,774
pressed against it, and looks like some other
things are stacked, basically covering this

2544
02:39:10,774 --> 02:39:12,506
entrance.

2545
02:39:12,506 --> 02:39:18,266
LIAM: I would like to just sit down on the ground
and close my eyes and listen for a full minute and

2546
02:39:18,266 --> 02:39:19,987
see if I hear anything.

2547
02:39:19,987 --> 02:39:22,605
MATT: Make a perception check.

2548
02:39:22,605 --> 02:39:25,034
LIAM: 21.

2549
02:39:25,034 --> 02:39:33,879
MATT: 21. You take a minute, close your eyes, and
take in all audio you can. Stillness. Quiet.

2550
02:39:33,879 --> 02:39:35,525
Nothing.

2551
02:39:35,525 --> 02:39:44,190
LIAM: Pretty good. I quietly walk all the way
back, and walk behind the group, and I go, goosh!

2552
02:39:44,190 --> 02:39:45,734
Look at that.

2553
02:39:45,734 --> 02:39:51,015
LAURA: I swear to Pelor, if you would have gotten
us killed...

2554
02:39:51,015 --> 02:39:52,714
MARISHA: Where did you go just then?

2555
02:39:52,714 --> 02:39:54,795
LIAM: I was like ten feet around the corner.

2556
02:39:54,795 --> 02:39:57,030
SAM: He was right here the whole time.

2557
02:39:57,030 --> 02:40:00,602
TALIESIN: I'm going to take care of a little
business outside, and then we'll seal up the

2558
02:40:00,602 --> 02:40:01,381
opening.

2559
02:40:01,381 --> 02:40:02,846
SAM: Excuse me? What are you doing outside?

2560
02:40:02,846 --> 02:40:04,741
TALIESIN: I'm going to charge the Diplomacy
glove.

2561
02:40:04,741 --> 02:40:06,533
MATT: It's already sealed. Grog already sealed
it.

2562
02:40:06,533 --> 02:40:07,687
TALIESIN: Grog already sealed it?

2563
02:40:07,687 --> 02:40:09,694
MATT: Yeah. He pulled rocks into it and closed the
exit.

2564
02:40:09,694 --> 02:40:12,694
LAURA: I glare at Vax and I lay down to go to
sleep.

2565
02:40:12,694 --> 02:40:14,094
SAM: Can we do it here?

2566
02:40:14,094 --> 02:40:16,203
TALIESIN: We can't do it in here because it would
make too much noise.

2567
02:40:16,203 --> 02:40:18,901
MARISHA: This room won't fit my storm cloud.

2568
02:40:18,901 --> 02:40:22,582
SAM: Wait. Pike, do you have any sort of Cone of
Silence, or anything? Do you have a Cone of

2569
02:40:22,582 --> 02:40:23,570
Silence?

2570
02:40:23,570 --> 02:40:24,842
MARISHA: Why?

2571
02:40:24,842 --> 02:40:26,165
SAM: He's going to make noise.

2572
02:40:26,165 --> 02:40:27,445
MARISHA: No, it's not going to work.

2573
02:40:27,445 --> 02:40:32,742
LIAM: I've got this. I pick up two small,
roundish, oval-shaped stones from the ground, and

2574
02:40:32,813 --> 02:40:37,930
I slide them into Grog's nostrils, plugging them
up.

2575
02:40:37,930 --> 02:40:45,467
MATT: Make a sleight-of-hand check. Grog? What's
your passive perception?

2576
02:40:45,467 --> 02:40:47,984
TRAVIS: Oh, ten.

2577
02:40:47,984 --> 02:40:48,982
MATT: Okay.

2578
02:40:48,982 --> 02:40:51,494
SAM: Where's passive perception?

2579
02:40:51,494 --> 02:40:53,651
LAURA: It's under all your other attributes.

2580
02:40:53,651 --> 02:40:54,710
LIAM: 14.

2581
02:40:54,710 --> 02:41:01,811
MATT: Okay. As you step away, there's a (snort) as
your nostrils are stopped up now, and the airflow

2582
02:41:01,811 --> 02:41:06,565
is impeded partially from the way you're used to.
You begin breathing heavily through the mouth in

2583
02:41:06,619 --> 02:41:07,680
reaction.

2584
02:41:07,680 --> 02:41:11,986
TRAVIS: (loud snoring)

2585
02:41:11,986 --> 02:41:17,841
LAURA: I wake up to the terrible-- Ugh! What is
that? Grog!

2586
02:41:17,841 --> 02:41:22,321
TRAVIS: And I cough, and the stones shoot out of
my nose back at Vax.

2587
02:41:22,321 --> 02:41:24,744
(laughter)

2588
02:41:24,744 --> 02:41:25,998
TRAVIS: With a high velocity.

2589
02:41:25,998 --> 02:41:27,488
LIAM: I'm removing one hit point from my--

2590
02:41:27,488 --> 02:41:30,197
MATT: Yeah. One beans you in the side of the
temple.

2591
02:41:30,197 --> 02:41:32,951
TRAVIS: Covered in Grog "boge."

2592
02:41:32,951 --> 02:41:34,953
(laughter)

2593
02:41:34,953 --> 02:41:36,696
TALIESIN: I'm sleeping.

2594
02:41:36,696 --> 02:41:40,859
LAURA: And the guardian that Pike conjured is
guarding us?

2595
02:41:40,859 --> 02:41:44,553
MATT: Is there, just keeping ever vigil for the
next eight hours.

2596
02:41:44,553 --> 02:41:45,630
ASHLEY: Chilling.

2597
02:41:45,630 --> 02:41:46,949
LAURA: Let's fucking rest!

2598
02:41:46,949 --> 02:41:48,402
MARISHA: Who's still awake?

2599
02:41:48,402 --> 02:41:52,685
TRAVIS: Be careful when you go to sleep. Shit
falls in your nose.

2600
02:41:52,685 --> 02:41:55,540
MATT: Are you guys taking shifts, or are you
leaving it to the guardian?

2601
02:41:55,540 --> 02:41:56,446
TRAVIS: Leave it to the guardian.

2602
02:41:56,446 --> 02:41:57,532
SAM: The guardian's got this.

2603
02:41:57,532 --> 02:42:02,978
MARISHA: I look at Vax before we go to sleep, and
I say, not going to pull any more jenga moments,

2604
02:42:02,978 --> 02:42:04,241
are you?

2605
02:42:04,241 --> 02:42:06,747
LIAM: No. No, I'm not.

2606
02:42:06,747 --> 02:42:14,277
MARISHA: You sure? Because you just did that
secret walkaround there. We notice when you sneak

2607
02:42:14,277 --> 02:42:16,146
off. You do know that, right?

2608
02:42:16,146 --> 02:42:19,278
LIAM: No. My rolls are too high; you really don't
notice.

2609
02:42:19,278 --> 02:42:21,457
(laughter)

2610
02:42:21,457 --> 02:42:22,979
TRAVIS: This is true.

2611
02:42:22,979 --> 02:42:24,852
LIAM: But I'm not going anywhere.

2612
02:42:24,852 --> 02:42:35,412
MARISHA: Okay. Hey. I was the only one who didn't
give you shit for that. Just keep that in mind.

2613
02:42:35,412 --> 02:42:37,902
TRAVIS: I did. You can fuck off and get yourself
killed.

2614
02:42:37,902 --> 02:42:39,636
LAURA: You're asleep.

2615
02:42:39,636 --> 02:42:40,832
TRAVIS: (snores)

2616
02:42:40,832 --> 02:42:43,019
(laughter)

2617
02:42:43,145 --> 02:42:51,561
LIAM: I'm going to go sit down by Percy, and what
I'd like to do is watch everybody nod off, and in

2618
02:42:51,561 --> 02:42:54,503
20 minutes, nudge him awake.

2619
02:42:54,503 --> 02:42:56,192
TALIESIN: (groans)

2620
02:42:56,192 --> 02:43:01,230
LIAM: Hi.

2621
02:43:01,230 --> 02:43:05,791
TALIESIN: Yes?

2622
02:43:05,791 --> 02:43:09,053
LIAM: I want you to get some sleep, but I want to
talk for a minute.

2623
02:43:09,053 --> 02:43:11,318
TALIESIN: I don't know if I can do both of those
things, but okay.

2624
02:43:11,318 --> 02:43:14,657
LIAM: That's all right. We can separate them. This
thing.

2625
02:43:14,657 --> 02:43:17,008
TALIESIN: Yes?

2626
02:43:17,008 --> 02:43:26,471
LIAM: What do you really know about it? How do we
know that this thing isn't whispering in Sylas's

2627
02:43:26,471 --> 02:43:30,241
ear? What do you really know about this thing?

2628
02:43:30,241 --> 02:43:39,580
TALIESIN: I don't know anything about this thing,
except that this last time... this last time was

2629
02:43:39,580 --> 02:43:54,721
different than the first time. This last time
didn't... (sighs) This last time, I felt more like

2630
02:43:54,789 --> 02:44:08,289
me, and less like I was being drawn somewhere. I
wasn't entirely me, but it's hard to describe. I

2631
02:44:08,289 --> 02:44:21,672
felt like I had contained it, a bit. I feel like,
maybe, maybe I can keep it under check.

2632
02:44:21,672 --> 02:44:24,171
I don't know.

2633
02:44:24,171 --> 02:44:35,145
LIAM: I want to tell you something. We're almost
like family now, and I've seen you do many great

2634
02:44:35,145 --> 02:44:46,861
things, and you have earned my trust, but if you
hurt my sister... If you hurt anyone else in this

2635
02:44:46,913 --> 02:44:49,578
group inadvertently--

2636
02:44:49,578 --> 02:44:52,110
TALIESIN: I would expect no less.

2637
02:44:52,110 --> 02:44:58,564
LIAM: All right, then.

2638
02:44:58,564 --> 02:45:02,644
TALIESIN: Vax? I have a sister!

2639
02:45:02,644 --> 02:45:06,328
LIAM: It's pretty cool, isn't it?

2640
02:45:06,328 --> 02:45:10,608
TALIESIN: I'm hoping.

2641
02:45:10,608 --> 02:45:16,195
LIAM: Well, hold onto that.

2642
02:45:16,195 --> 02:45:18,275
TALIESIN: I shall.

2643
02:45:18,275 --> 02:45:20,902
TRAVIS: I let out a little sleep fart.

2644
02:45:20,902 --> 02:45:26,487
LIAM: Can I borrow just a pinch of your black
powder?

2645
02:45:26,487 --> 02:45:28,365
TALIESIN: No, I'm running really low. No.

2646
02:45:28,365 --> 02:45:30,159
LIAM: Just a finger dab?

2647
02:45:30,159 --> 02:45:33,591
TALIESIN: No. Oh, god. Yes.

2648
02:45:33,591 --> 02:45:43,410
LIAM: I lick my pinky and I put it in, and I
slowly draw a big ballsack on Grog's forehead.

2649
02:45:43,410 --> 02:45:45,467
MATT: Roll a sleight-of-hand check.

2650
02:45:45,467 --> 02:45:46,620
LIAM: Sure.

2651
02:45:46,620 --> 02:45:48,543
TALIESIN: I'm going to sleep before this happens.

2652
02:45:48,543 --> 02:45:50,096
LIAM: That's a 23.

2653
02:45:50,096 --> 02:45:52,763
MATT: Grog, roll a perception check, just for the
hell of it.

2654
02:45:52,763 --> 02:45:56,536
TRAVIS: 18?

2655
02:45:56,536 --> 02:46:01,354
MATT: Deftly blended in with the tattoos, unless
those who are aware, there are strange new series

2656
02:46:01,410 --> 02:46:04,618
of markings across Grog's face that he may not
notice for quite some time.

2657
02:46:04,835 --> 02:46:07,121
LIAM: I did do little hairs on them, as well.

2658
02:46:07,121 --> 02:46:08,497
MATT: Oh, how detailed.

2659
02:46:08,497 --> 02:46:11,739
LIAM: Well, it grows here, so it grows there.

2660
02:46:11,739 --> 02:46:14,919
MATT: You don't know. (laughs)

2661
02:46:14,919 --> 02:46:17,215
LIAM: I don't know. Or do I?

2662
02:46:17,215 --> 02:46:20,436
MATT: Oh! All right. You guys go to sleep?

2663
02:46:20,436 --> 02:46:24,796
LIAM: He goes to sleep. I'm going to do my duty
with Keyleth for a watch.

2664
02:46:24,796 --> 02:46:26,608
LAURA: No, Keyleth went to sleep.

2665
02:46:26,608 --> 02:46:28,074
LIAM: I thought we were both staying up.

2666
02:46:28,074 --> 02:46:29,416
MATT: You look back over at Keyleth, and she's
asleep.

2667
02:46:29,416 --> 02:46:30,980
LIAM: All right. I'll watch everybody.

2668
02:46:30,980 --> 02:46:33,328
MATT: Are you going to sleep at all?

2669
02:46:33,328 --> 02:46:35,177
LIAM: I'll stay up for two hours.

2670
02:46:35,177 --> 02:46:42,918
MATT: You stay up for the two hours. There doesn't
seem to be much incident whatsoever. There's that

2671
02:46:42,918 --> 02:46:46,499
gentle draft coming through from some of the
cracks in the stones that were set up to block the

2672
02:46:46,499 --> 02:46:51,475
entryway. It was not a perfect hole, of course,
just enough to not arouse suspicion. There is cold

2673
02:46:51,475 --> 02:46:55,859
air seeping through. You can hear the rain muffled
in the distance, and there's a little bit of a

2674
02:46:55,859 --> 02:47:00,157
leak coming through from where the stones were set
up to block the entrance. Eventually, sleep comes

2675
02:47:00,211 --> 02:47:07,725
to you. It is a strange lulling sound. Everyone
sleeps, relatively comfortably for being in the

2676
02:47:07,775 --> 02:47:10,077
middle of a stone tunnel.

2677
02:47:10,077 --> 02:47:21,978
You have dreams again. Dreams, images, flashes.
Flashes of your family hanging from the Sun Tree.

2678
02:47:21,978 --> 02:47:31,753
It never happened, but your mind creates the image
for you. You see flashes of your sister screaming

2679
02:47:31,753 --> 02:47:39,783
out to you as the arrows take her in the chest.
You see a flash of what looks like a skull, a

2680
02:47:39,783 --> 02:47:45,381
skull face. The skull brings itself to where you
focus on one of its ocular sockets, and blood

2681
02:47:45,381 --> 02:47:51,255
begins to pour from the socket. Flash to black. A
familiar voice rings out again:

2682
02:47:51,255 --> 02:48:01,424
"Do not forget our deal."

2683
02:48:01,424 --> 02:48:05,887
Cold morning air comes to you as you all slowly
come to consciousness. Uncomfortable, kinks in

2684
02:48:05,887 --> 02:48:11,294
your back. It's not the best place to sleep, but
the bare minimum of the long rest is achieved

2685
02:48:11,294 --> 02:48:15,597
throughout the evening. As you all eventually come
to and check and make sure everyone's okay, you

2686
02:48:15,597 --> 02:48:18,304
awake, a little unnerved.

2687
02:48:18,304 --> 02:48:19,837
SAM: I look around for Pike.

2688
02:48:19,837 --> 02:48:21,083
LAURA: Is she still here?

2689
02:48:21,083 --> 02:48:25,991
MATT: Pike is just waking up. She's still there.
Her image, you can see, in her sleeping state, is

2690
02:48:25,991 --> 02:48:31,227
diminished. When she comes to consciousness, it
almost flares up again. Her presence here is

2691
02:48:31,227 --> 02:48:37,667
purely a force of will, and that connection is a
very tenuous one.

2692
02:48:37,667 --> 02:48:42,697
I would like everyone to make a constitution
check.

2693
02:48:42,697 --> 02:48:44,122
LAURA: Constitution?

2694
02:48:44,122 --> 02:48:46,481
MARISHA: Corruption, man.

2695
02:48:46,481 --> 02:48:49,146
LAURA: Yeah, you're right. I'm going to go sparkle
stone.

2696
02:48:49,146 --> 02:48:52,587
LIAM: Natural 20.

2697
02:48:52,587 --> 02:48:57,915
MARISHA: Son of a fuck. Natural one. My third of
the evening.

2698
02:48:57,915 --> 02:48:59,153
SAM: Five.

2699
02:48:59,153 --> 02:49:00,346
MATT: Five.

2700
02:49:00,346 --> 02:49:01,572
TRAVIS: 17.

2701
02:49:01,572 --> 02:49:02,414
LAURA: 16.

2702
02:49:02,414 --> 02:49:03,414
LIAM: 20.

2703
02:49:03,414 --> 02:49:04,359
TALIESIN: 22.

2704
02:49:04,359 --> 02:49:05,545
MATT: All righty.

2705
02:49:05,545 --> 02:49:07,233
LAURA: You rolled a one, Keyleth?

2706
02:49:07,233 --> 02:49:09,807
MARISHA: I had bad dreams.

2707
02:49:09,807 --> 02:49:19,118
MATT: The DC on this is not as high. Everyone but
Keyleth passed. Keyleth, as you wake up, there's a

2708
02:49:19,118 --> 02:49:27,462
general cold sensation within your body, and you
feel like there's really no way to keep warm, no

2709
02:49:27,462 --> 02:49:31,295
matter how hard you try and bundle up. You even
use a bit of Druidcraft to create a bit of

2710
02:49:31,295 --> 02:49:35,382
sparkling warm fire that you use to keep your
hands set, and the cold doesn't seem to go away.

2711
02:49:35,382 --> 02:49:40,477
MARISHA: I keep my hands aflame and kind of rub
myself.

2712
02:49:40,477 --> 02:49:49,587
MATT: Okay. Your hands are shaking unnaturally,
and there's a general chatter to your teeth. You

2713
02:49:49,587 --> 02:49:53,411
have disadvantage on any dexterity ability
checks.

2714
02:49:53,411 --> 02:49:57,356
MARISHA: Glad I don't use a bow.

2715
02:49:57,356 --> 02:50:01,773
MATT: Skill checks. Wouldn't affect attacks. I
will say it doesn't really affect initiative, per

2716
02:50:01,773 --> 02:50:06,430
se, but if you were to try to do any delicate
handwork, you would have disadvantage.

2717
02:50:06,430 --> 02:50:15,313
LAURA: Should we, before we get this shit going,
have a feast? A big fucking feast?

2718
02:50:15,313 --> 02:50:16,524
SAM: We should have a feast.

2719
02:50:16,524 --> 02:50:17,867
MARISHA: That sounds good, yeah.

2720
02:50:17,867 --> 02:50:20,186
LAURA: We still have a couple of feasts left.

2721
02:50:20,186 --> 02:50:27,106
MARISHA: I will say, if we choose to feast, I will
not be able to Sunbeam.

2722
02:50:27,106 --> 02:50:30,054
SAM: Well, that is a problem.

2723
02:50:30,054 --> 02:50:32,159
LAURA: Should we have feasted last night?

2724
02:50:32,159 --> 02:50:35,296
MARISHA: I couldn't. I burned my Sunbeam. We
couldn't have done it.

2725
02:50:35,296 --> 02:50:39,597
SAM: Pike can't help in any way?

2726
02:50:39,650 --> 02:50:42,069
MARISHA: I don't know if Pike--

2727
02:50:42,069 --> 02:50:44,676
ASHLEY: I don't have that ability.

2728
02:50:44,676 --> 02:50:50,213
MARISHA: Does she have access to sixth-level spells?
We haven't leveled Pike up in a while.

2729
02:50:50,213 --> 02:50:54,093
ASHLEY: I don't know if I've--

2730
02:50:54,093 --> 02:50:57,979
MATT: You've gained a modicum of experience while
you were away from the party, just at a slower

2731
02:50:57,979 --> 02:51:01,953
rate, so you are at a lower level than the rest of
the party. Not by a terrible amount, but you'd be

2732
02:51:01,953 --> 02:51:04,001
level 11 by now, probably.

2733
02:51:04,001 --> 02:51:05,901
MARISHA: So she would have a sixth-level spell.

2734
02:51:05,901 --> 02:51:07,363
LAURA: So she has Feast.

2735
02:51:07,363 --> 02:51:09,267
MARISHA: It depends on if clerics have it.

2736
02:51:09,267 --> 02:51:11,685
MATT: Clerics do have access to Heroes' Feast.

2737
02:51:11,685 --> 02:51:14,436
ASHLEY: Let me check.

2738
02:51:14,436 --> 02:51:17,519
MARISHA: But that would also mean Pike burning her
6th-level spell slot.

2739
02:51:17,573 --> 02:51:24,065
MATT: Correct. So you would have one 6th-level
spell. If you wanted to, you could prepare that as

2740
02:51:24,065 --> 02:51:27,764
your prepared 6th-level spell for the day. That is
your choice, Pike.

2741
02:51:27,764 --> 02:51:31,993
LAURA: We get saves on all wisdom throws, which
might come in handy when we're fighting against

2742
02:51:31,993 --> 02:51:33,875
things that control our minds.

2743
02:51:33,875 --> 02:51:37,240
ASHLEY: Oh dang. I haven't even looked through
these yet.

2744
02:51:37,240 --> 02:51:44,823
LIAM: While the fancy people are talking, I walk
over to Grog and say, big man. You've got mud or

2745
02:51:44,823 --> 02:51:48,491
something on your face. Come here. And I take my
hand and I wipe across his forehead and smear out

2746
02:51:48,491 --> 02:51:49,585
what I did.

2747
02:51:49,585 --> 02:51:51,222
TRAVIS: Don't fucking touch me!

2748
02:51:51,222 --> 02:51:52,173
LIAM: Sorry.

2749
02:51:52,173 --> 02:51:53,733
(laughter)

2750
02:51:53,733 --> 02:51:57,021
TRAVIS: You're all cuddly in the morning and shit.
God, get it together.

2751
02:51:57,021 --> 02:51:58,357
LIAM: Sorry.

2752
02:51:58,357 --> 02:52:03,141
TRAVIS: I lean over to Vex and I go, how do I
look?

2753
02:52:03,213 --> 02:52:05,038
LAURA: You look lovely, dear.

2754
02:52:05,038 --> 02:52:06,612
TRAVIS: Damn right.

2755
02:52:06,612 --> 02:52:14,644
SAM: I have questions for us, while Pike is
looking up her spells. First question is: how on

2756
02:52:14,644 --> 02:52:20,864
earth are we supposed to send a signal to the rest
of the town when we're in a tunnel?

2757
02:52:20,887 --> 02:52:22,229
LAURA: We can open it up.

2758
02:52:22,229 --> 02:52:23,181
SAM: From where?

2759
02:52:23,181 --> 02:52:24,166
LAURA: From here.

2760
02:52:24,166 --> 02:52:27,017
TALIESIN: Once we're inside the castle, we'll be
able to--

2761
02:52:27,017 --> 02:52:29,393
MARISHA: I can Skywrite again.

2762
02:52:29,393 --> 02:52:33,061
LAURA: You could Skywrite right now, as soon as we
decide to start moving.

2763
02:52:33,061 --> 02:52:34,730
MARISHA: I just need to move the boulders a bit.

2764
02:52:34,730 --> 02:52:39,347
LAURA: Yeah. Open the rocks up. People start
attacking the castle; we come from the other side,

2765
02:52:39,347 --> 02:52:40,667
from within.

2766
02:52:40,667 --> 02:52:46,276
SAM: Is that our plan? We're going to say,
"Rebels, go," wait a while, and then attack?

2767
02:52:46,408 --> 02:52:48,126
TALIESIN: Not even wait a while. We'll go in.

2768
02:52:48,126 --> 02:52:49,612
LAURA: Go in at the same time.

2769
02:52:49,612 --> 02:52:51,967
LIAM: We throw the signal to the sky and go up
this tunnel.

2770
02:52:52,019 --> 02:52:53,935
SAM: Shouldn't we wait a little?

2771
02:52:53,935 --> 02:52:57,914
LAURA: Wait like five minutes to let them rabble up
and start running.

2772
02:52:57,914 --> 02:53:00,033
SAM: Remember, last time I was supposed to create
a diversion...

2773
02:53:00,033 --> 02:53:02,659
LAURA: Yeah, but then you took down a whole
house.

2774
02:53:02,711 --> 02:53:04,354
TALIESIN: Well, we had a Grog.

2775
02:53:04,354 --> 02:53:11,419
SAM: Believe me, I was amazing, but maybe we
should incite the rebellion, wait a half hour, and

2776
02:53:11,419 --> 02:53:12,654
then go.

2777
02:53:12,654 --> 02:53:20,481
TALIESIN: Let's see if we can keep civilian
casualties to a reasonably small amount.

2778
02:53:20,481 --> 02:53:23,182
MARISHA: We're the most capable people in this
town right now.

2779
02:53:23,182 --> 02:53:28,700
SAM: Well, that's another question. We are. Does
one of us need to go out there and lead the

2780
02:53:28,700 --> 02:53:29,609
rebels?

2781
02:53:29,609 --> 02:53:30,672
LAURA AND TALIESIN: No.

2782
02:53:30,672 --> 02:53:31,388
TALIESIN: We're fine.

2783
02:53:31,388 --> 02:53:32,476
SAM: What do you mean, no?

2784
02:53:32,476 --> 02:53:35,553
MARISHA: They've got Yennan. He's awesome. He was
a badass cleric.

2785
02:53:35,553 --> 02:53:36,940
SAM: If he survived the night.

2786
02:53:36,940 --> 02:53:43,081
TRAVIS: What if they don't take the rebels
seriously because we're not with them? Maybe one

2787
02:53:43,081 --> 02:53:44,432
of us should go.

2788
02:53:44,432 --> 02:53:46,183
SAM: Maybe Pike should.

2789
02:53:46,183 --> 02:53:48,391
TALIESIN: I think it's going to take all of us to
defeat the Briarwoods.

2790
02:53:48,391 --> 02:53:50,111
LAURA: I think we all need to go together.

2791
02:53:50,111 --> 02:53:54,131
TALIESIN: Once the Briarwoods are gone, I think a
lot of this will get a lot easier.

2792
02:53:54,131 --> 02:53:55,455
TRAVIS: We could meet in the middle.

2793
02:53:55,455 --> 02:54:02,965
SAM: I'm just saying, if Pike is fading on us, it
might be best to send her out to lead the rebels.

2794
02:54:02,965 --> 02:54:06,381
LAURA: No, she's not fading on us, you dick! She's
coming with us.

2795
02:54:06,381 --> 02:54:13,532
LIAM: Scanlan, we're going to make a leap of faith
that Pike can stay.

2796
02:54:13,532 --> 02:54:24,237
SAM: And if, in the horribly unfortunate scenario
where she can't. Pike, can you leave us anything?

2797
02:54:24,237 --> 02:54:26,247
LAURA: A Heroes' Fucking Feast.

2798
02:54:26,247 --> 02:54:32,005
SAM: A potion. A spell. A prayer. A symbol. A
"siggle." Anything?

2799
02:54:32,058 --> 02:54:34,109
MATT: A sigil.

2800
02:54:34,109 --> 02:54:37,793
SAM: Oh. Oh, a sigil. I said it wrong.

2801
02:54:37,793 --> 02:54:40,193
LIAM: Oh, prepare to be GIF'd, Mercer.

2802
02:54:40,193 --> 02:54:42,341
MATT: (laughs) Yeah.

2803
02:54:42,341 --> 02:54:54,140
ASHLEY: Wow. There's some amazing-- just a side
note, there's one called Heal that can heal a

2804
02:54:54,140 --> 02:54:57,124
person 70 hit points.

2805
02:54:57,124 --> 02:54:57,865
MATT: True.

2806
02:54:57,865 --> 02:54:58,935
ASHLEY: Just like that.

2807
02:54:58,935 --> 02:54:59,857
LAURA: That's pretty awesome.

2808
02:54:59,857 --> 02:55:02,682
MATT: So, Heroes' Feast, Heal. You've got to pick
one.

2809
02:55:02,682 --> 02:55:03,965
LAURA: Heroes' Feast!

2810
02:55:03,965 --> 02:55:05,755
SAM: Heroes' Feast raises all of our hit points
higher.

2811
02:55:05,755 --> 02:55:07,524
LIAM: Way to humble-brag, Pike.

2812
02:55:07,524 --> 02:55:09,767
LAURA: It makes us more badass.

2813
02:55:09,767 --> 02:55:12,974
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's do the Heroes' Feast, then.

2814
02:55:12,974 --> 02:55:15,707
MARISHA: We're going to eat up? Fuck yeah.

2815
02:55:15,707 --> 02:55:22,124
MATT: All right, so mark off your other thousand gold
chalice that you had purchased beforehand. I think

2816
02:55:22,178 --> 02:55:23,363
you're out now, aren't you?

2817
02:55:23,363 --> 02:55:24,811
MARISHA: Yes, I believe we need to go shopping.

2818
02:55:24,811 --> 02:55:26,564
LAURA: You needed one more. You had one more, I
thought.

2819
02:55:26,564 --> 02:55:29,802
MATT: She has one more. It's being used right now.
She'd purchased two before you left.

2820
02:55:29,802 --> 02:55:35,354
MARISHA: Pike, you wouldn't happen to have a
thousand gold-worth chalice on you, would you?

2821
02:55:35,354 --> 02:55:36,770
LIAM: Only astrally.

2822
02:55:36,770 --> 02:55:37,693
MARISHA: Never mind.

2823
02:55:37,693 --> 02:55:39,287
MATT: I would think probably not.

2824
02:55:39,287 --> 02:55:40,627
MARISHA: Don't worry about it.

2825
02:55:40,627 --> 02:55:45,430
MATT: You hand over the chalice to Pike. Pike, you
take the chalice and you set it down before you.

2826
02:55:45,430 --> 02:55:50,959
You mark a symbol in the dirt in the center of
this tunnel in the shape of a giant rectangular

2827
02:55:50,959 --> 02:55:57,289
table. You take your holy symbol, remove it from
your neck, and thrust it into the ground at the

2828
02:55:57,289 --> 02:56:02,384
head of the table. With that, dust kicks up as
seemingly out of nowhere, this giant table and

2829
02:56:02,384 --> 02:56:04,435
feast just (fwoosh) rises.

2830
02:56:04,435 --> 02:56:08,349
LAURA: Oh my god, is it a holy feast? Do we all do
holy damage now?

2831
02:56:08,400 --> 02:56:11,482
MATT: No, but holy shit, it's delicious.

2832
02:56:11,482 --> 02:56:13,403
TRAVIS: (laughing) "Holy shit, it's delicious."

2833
02:56:13,403 --> 02:56:14,814
(laughter)

2834
02:56:14,814 --> 02:56:16,280
MATT: It is very good.

2835
02:56:16,280 --> 02:56:17,883
LIAM: Best line of the night!

2836
02:56:17,883 --> 02:56:23,517
MATT: Benches around and available. You all sit
around it and dig into the most delightful

2837
02:56:23,517 --> 02:56:28,912
mid-tunnel, cold sub-castle breakfast you've ever
had.

2838
02:56:28,912 --> 02:56:30,394
LIAM: Ice cream.

2839
02:56:30,394 --> 02:56:32,148
LAURA: Give me that pencil.

2840
02:56:32,148 --> 02:56:37,291
MATT: So you guys all, for the next 24 hours, have
advantage on wisdom saving throws, and I believe

2841
02:56:37,291 --> 02:56:39,886
it's 2d6? Is that what it was, Marisha?

2842
02:56:39,886 --> 02:56:41,780
MARISHA: 2d10 or 2d8.

2843
02:56:41,780 --> 02:56:43,571
MATT: I'll look it up right here.

2844
02:56:43,571 --> 02:56:44,838
TALIESIN: Wisdom advantage.

2845
02:56:44,838 --> 02:56:46,326
LAURA: I think it's 2d12.

2846
02:56:46,326 --> 02:56:47,264
MARISHA: 2d12?

2847
02:56:47,264 --> 02:56:52,305
MATT: Heroes' Feast. Nope, 2d10. Everyone, roll
2d10 and add that temporary hit points to your HP

2848
02:56:52,305 --> 02:56:57,296
value. That includes you, too, Pike. So roll 2d10
and that's temporary hit points on top of your

2849
02:56:57,296 --> 02:57:01,943
regular hit points. Meaning once those go away,
they cannot be healed back.

2850
02:57:01,943 --> 02:57:04,304
LIAM: Still not cracking a hundred.

2851
02:57:04,304 --> 02:57:08,929
TALIESIN: Nice!

2852
02:57:08,929 --> 02:57:12,056
SAM: And advantage on wisdom saves.

2853
02:57:12,056 --> 02:57:14,444
MARISHA: And we're immune to fear.

2854
02:57:14,444 --> 02:57:15,397
MATT: Yep.

2855
02:57:15,397 --> 02:57:16,710
SAM: Seriously?

2856
02:57:16,710 --> 02:57:18,728
MARISHA: And poison, I think.

2857
02:57:18,728 --> 02:57:20,544
MATT: Yep. You're immune to poison.

2858
02:57:20,544 --> 02:57:23,833
MARISHA: Immune to fear, immune to poison, and
immune to what else?

2859
02:57:23,891 --> 02:57:28,962
MATT: And you get advantage on all wisdom saving
throws. Heroes' Feast, motherfucker!

2860
02:57:28,962 --> 02:57:31,829
LIAM: Immune to fear, and what was it?

2861
02:57:31,829 --> 02:57:37,020
MATT: Immune to fear and poison. Oh, such a good
spell. Very expensive, but damn

2862
02:57:37,020 --> 02:57:38,503
if it hasn't been clutch.

2863
02:57:38,503 --> 02:57:47,047
MARISHA: I'm going to move out some rocks. Just
enough where I can peek out. Are we ready to go?

2864
02:57:47,047 --> 02:57:49,186
SAM: Go? Go where? What?

2865
02:57:49,186 --> 02:57:50,441
LAURA: To do this!

2866
02:57:50,441 --> 02:57:53,350
MARISHA: I'm just going to start this. We can talk
as we go.

2867
02:57:53,350 --> 02:57:54,799
SAM: You've got to go outside first.

2868
02:57:54,799 --> 02:57:56,182
MARISHA: I'm going outside.

2869
02:57:56,182 --> 02:57:57,097
SAM: Okay.

2870
02:57:57,097 --> 02:58:01,356
MARISHA: I'm going outside. Is it still rainy?

2871
02:58:01,356 --> 02:58:04,681
MATT: It is not raining, currently. The sky is
still cloudy and dark.

2872
02:58:04,681 --> 02:58:05,726
MARISHA: Still cloudy?

2873
02:58:05,726 --> 02:58:06,731
MATT: Yeah.

2874
02:58:06,731 --> 02:58:13,523
MARISHA: Okay, so I take the clouds and I darken
them and do a giant de Rolo crest that expands

2875
02:58:13,523 --> 02:58:14,835
over the whole city.

2876
02:58:14,835 --> 02:58:17,747
MATT: Okay, so with Grog's help, you move some of
the rocks out of the way. You get a visual of the

2877
02:58:17,747 --> 02:58:24,916
sky. You lean out, focus, cast your Skywrite
spell-- mark that spell off-- and as you coalesce

2878
02:58:24,916 --> 02:58:30,420
the clouds to be extremely dark and to form the de
Rolo crest symbol in the sky. As that happens, you

2879
02:58:30,420 --> 02:58:35,578
begin to see, about two minutes later, little
beacon lights begin to ignite across the city:

2880
02:58:35,578 --> 02:58:44,383
lanterns and torches being lit. It looks like, as
it is probably an hour past dawn, that the

2881
02:58:44,383 --> 02:58:50,793
surviving remainder of the Whitestone rebellion is
raring itself to attack.

2882
02:58:50,793 --> 02:58:54,839
LAURA: We should have sung "One Day More."

2883
02:58:54,839 --> 02:59:04,348
SAM: Well, we still can. (laughs) Before we do
this, I love you all, and I wish us all the best

2884
02:59:04,348 --> 02:59:10,709
of luck today. I especially love Pike, and I'm so
happy she's with us for this. If some of us don't

2885
02:59:10,709 --> 02:59:17,894
return, I think that the glory of what we're doing
today, and the justice of what we're doing today,

2886
02:59:17,894 --> 02:59:22,002
has been worth it, and Percy, I hope you get some
sort of redemption in all of this.

2887
02:59:22,002 --> 02:59:23,882
TALIESIN: (sighs)

2888
02:59:23,882 --> 02:59:25,292
MARISHA: To the de Rolos.

2889
02:59:25,292 --> 02:59:26,771
SAM: To the de Rolos.

2890
02:59:26,771 --> 02:59:27,647
MARISHA: To Whitestone.

2891
02:59:27,647 --> 02:59:28,937
TALIESIN: To Whitestone.

2892
02:59:28,937 --> 02:59:30,069
LAURA: To Vox Machina.

2893
02:59:30,069 --> 02:59:31,726
MARISHA: To Vox Machina.

2894
02:59:31,726 --> 02:59:37,436
MATT: You may raise your glass and drink if you'd
like, Ashley.

2895
02:59:37,436 --> 02:59:39,630
ASHLEY: Oh, thanks!

2896
02:59:39,630 --> 02:59:42,387
MATT: There we go. (laughs)

2897
02:59:42,387 --> 02:59:45,667
MARISHA: Do that Ben and Jerry's pint.

2898
02:59:45,667 --> 02:59:48,540
(laughter)

2899
02:59:48,540 --> 02:59:53,289
MATT: As you guys finish your drink, the Heroes'
Feast slowly sinks back into the dirt, leaving the

2900
02:59:53,289 --> 03:00:00,537
empty tunnel before you. The slight cold sound of
drifting wind through the now freshly barricaded

2901
03:00:00,537 --> 03:00:06,341
rock exit of the secret passageway begins to reach
your ears. What do you wish to do?

2902
03:00:06,416 --> 03:00:09,580
TRAVIS: Do we want to check the wall?

2903
03:00:09,580 --> 03:00:13,500
LIAM: I'm taking point. I want to check out that
wall that I sat right in front of.

2904
03:00:13,500 --> 03:00:15,518
SAM: Let's all go down the tunnel.

2905
03:00:15,518 --> 03:00:16,582
LIAM: Yep. Come on, everyone.

2906
03:00:16,582 --> 03:00:18,303
MARISHA: I light up my hands for light.

2907
03:00:18,303 --> 03:00:19,278
MATT: Okay.

2908
03:00:19,278 --> 03:00:21,352
LAURA: Very quietly down the tunnel.

2909
03:00:21,352 --> 03:00:25,597
MATT: Using the veritable torchlight from
Keyleth's burning hands, you guys press down the

2910
03:00:25,597 --> 03:00:33,993
hallway, Vax taking point. Eventually, you get to
the end of the hallway. There's a portion of the

2911
03:00:33,993 --> 03:00:39,863
stone wall that has been chiseled out. It's not
very smooth; it's rough in the way it was

2912
03:00:39,863 --> 03:00:48,878
constructed, but there is definitely about a
foot-thick wall that would go to the right and

2913
03:00:48,937 --> 03:00:53,596
left of you in the dirt that has been chiseled and
broken through to reveal this passageway that you

2914
03:00:53,596 --> 03:00:55,068
guys are traversing.

2915
03:00:55,068 --> 03:00:59,264
Immediately on the other side of this opening, now
that you have a better look at it, it looks to be

2916
03:00:59,264 --> 03:01:03,404
some sort of stone sculpture or statue of some
kind.

2917
03:01:03,404 --> 03:01:04,944
ASHLEY: (sneezes)

2918
03:01:04,944 --> 03:01:06,004
LAURA AND MATT: Bless you.

2919
03:01:06,004 --> 03:01:11,495
MATT: You see what looks to be the back side of
some armored soldier, but it's all carved from

2920
03:01:11,495 --> 03:01:18,251
some sort of marble. At a closer look, too, Percy,
you see it's carved from the white stone that is

2921
03:01:18,251 --> 03:01:20,192
actually mined in this--

2922
03:01:20,192 --> 03:01:22,053
TALIESIN: Do I recognize this part of the
passage?

2923
03:01:22,053 --> 03:01:28,895
MATT: You do. This statue is one of the large
things used to hide this exit, and it is normally

2924
03:01:28,895 --> 03:01:34,132
shoved out of the way. There are a few other boxes
immediately adjacent to it, and from what little

2925
03:01:34,132 --> 03:01:38,319
bit you can glance past it, it looks like this
section is used for storage of some kind and is

2926
03:01:38,319 --> 03:01:43,203
filled with whatever random crates and whatever
needed to be placed down here to keep it out of

2927
03:01:43,203 --> 03:01:44,166
the way.

2928
03:01:44,166 --> 03:01:46,539
TRAVIS: Can someone check to make sure that it's
just a statue?

2929
03:01:46,539 --> 03:01:51,957
MARISHA: Can I do an arcana check to see?

2930
03:01:51,957 --> 03:01:53,066
MATT: Sure.

2931
03:01:53,066 --> 03:01:54,807
MARISHA: If it's magical? Magic trap?

2932
03:01:54,807 --> 03:01:58,796
LIAM: I'm going to perception it. 20 on
perception.

2933
03:01:58,871 --> 03:02:03,146
MARISHA: Natural 20. Making up for those fucking
ones.

2934
03:02:03,146 --> 03:02:09,500
MATT: There you go. As you step up and inspect the
back of the statue, the stonework is very well

2935
03:02:09,500 --> 03:02:18,034
done, and there is a very, very faint magical
essence to this statue. It's so miniscule, and the

2936
03:02:18,034 --> 03:02:24,282
only reason you're able to pick it up is you're so
fine-tuned to seeking out that presence. It

2937
03:02:24,282 --> 03:02:27,958
doesn't have a specific form; it doesn't have a
specific school of magic applied to it. It just

2938
03:02:27,958 --> 03:02:30,641
has a general, faint magical aura.

2939
03:02:30,641 --> 03:02:32,305
MARISHA: Is it carved out of the rock?

2940
03:02:32,305 --> 03:02:33,940
MATT: It's carved out of the white stone.

2941
03:02:33,940 --> 03:02:35,994
MARISHA: Got you. But it's not magically trapped?

2942
03:02:35,994 --> 03:02:39,725
MATT: Correct. It doesn't appear to have any sort of
strong magical presence for a specific purpose.

2943
03:02:39,725 --> 03:02:41,895
MARISHA: And if we touch it, we're not going to be
possessed or something.

2944
03:02:41,895 --> 03:02:43,178
MATT: You don't think so.

2945
03:02:43,178 --> 03:02:44,718
MARISHA: I don't think so.

2946
03:02:44,718 --> 03:02:54,139
LIAM: I silently signal to everyone, and I slowly
stealth around the statue to check out the room.

2947
03:02:54,139 --> 03:02:59,099
MATT: Okay. It's all pressed against the wall. The
widest gap is about that wide. You're going to

2948
03:02:59,099 --> 03:03:03,509
have to push or shove things out of the way. All
the crates are pushed up against it, blocking the

2949
03:03:03,509 --> 03:03:04,490
whole exit.

2950
03:03:04,490 --> 03:03:08,316
LAURA: Is it too big for you? Do you need maybe
somebody stronger?

2951
03:03:08,316 --> 03:03:12,486
LIAM: I reach out past my sister and pat him on
the shoulder.

2952
03:03:12,486 --> 03:03:13,604
TRAVIS: Yes?

2953
03:03:13,604 --> 03:03:15,396
LAURA: (whispering) I think you're up.

2954
03:03:15,396 --> 03:03:16,577
TRAVIS: Where? Up where?

2955
03:03:16,577 --> 03:03:18,639
LAURA: I think you need to move the fucking
statue.

2956
03:03:18,639 --> 03:03:19,883
TRAVIS: Oh!

2957
03:03:19,883 --> 03:03:21,661
LAURA: Quietly.

2958
03:03:21,661 --> 03:03:28,037
TRAVIS: (whispering) Oh. And I gently start to
push the statue out of the way.

2959
03:03:28,037 --> 03:03:31,249
MATT: Make a strength check.

2960
03:03:31,249 --> 03:03:33,162
LAURA: Oh no! Really?

2961
03:03:33,162 --> 03:03:35,075
TRAVIS: That's a one.

2962
03:03:35,075 --> 03:03:36,329
MATT: Natural one?

2963
03:03:36,329 --> 03:03:37,935
MARISHA: I'm sorry.

2964
03:03:37,935 --> 03:03:43,408
MATT: Grog cracks his fingers and grins, stepping
up. Goes to push the statue, and then pop!

2965
03:03:43,408 --> 03:03:47,401
Something in your lower back gives, and (groans).

2966
03:03:47,401 --> 03:03:49,582
LIAM: Peacock a little more for us, please.

2967
03:03:49,582 --> 03:03:53,801
MATT: The air escapes your lungs, and it's been a
long time since this injury has crept up, but you

2968
03:03:53,801 --> 03:03:56,167
threw your back out a little.

2969
03:03:56,167 --> 03:04:02,117
TRAVIS: I slide down and go, you know, I'm so
tired of (groans) taking all the glory. Why don't

2970
03:04:02,187 --> 03:04:03,622
you guys--

2971
03:04:03,622 --> 03:04:06,040
LAURA: Trinket? Trinket tries to--

2972
03:04:06,040 --> 03:04:09,832
MATT: Trinket, who, at this point in time, by the
way guys, takes up a large portion of the

2973
03:04:09,832 --> 03:04:10,805
tunnel--

2974
03:04:10,805 --> 03:04:12,515
LAURA: Yeah, he wants to get the fuck out of
here.

2975
03:04:12,515 --> 03:04:17,174
MATT: Pushes past you guys and turns around and
puts his rump against it and starts backing up

2976
03:04:17,174 --> 03:04:19,496
into it. (moans) Go ahead and roll a d20.

2977
03:04:19,496 --> 03:04:21,875
TALIESIN: Please defeat this door.

2978
03:04:21,875 --> 03:04:23,631
MARISHA: Fucking doors!

2979
03:04:23,631 --> 03:04:25,763
LIAM: (whispering) Can you please fix Grog's
back?

2980
03:04:25,763 --> 03:04:27,183
TALIESIN: Doors of Whitestone.

2981
03:04:27,183 --> 03:04:29,222
LAURA: Doors of fucking Whitestone! Oh god.

2982
03:04:29,222 --> 03:04:31,045
MATT: Add two to the roll.

2983
03:04:31,045 --> 03:04:32,695
LAURA: Only two?!

2984
03:04:32,695 --> 03:04:34,307
MATT: Yeah.

2985
03:04:34,307 --> 03:04:36,886
LAURA: I don't add his full strength? It doesn't
fucking matter, because I rolled a three.

2986
03:04:36,886 --> 03:04:38,803
MARISHA: Doors.

2987
03:04:38,803 --> 03:04:42,708
MATT: (laughing) Perpetually defeated by
passageways and entrances.

2988
03:04:42,708 --> 03:04:44,053
TALIESIN: Curse you, doors!

2989
03:04:44,053 --> 03:04:46,045
SAM: I've got this, guys.

2990
03:04:46,045 --> 03:04:51,158
LIAM: Wait, before we use-- listen. This could
potentially be humiliating for all of us. Before

2991
03:04:51,158 --> 03:04:59,339
we expend any of our arcane abilities, please let
us all at least try and fail before you take out

2992
03:04:59,339 --> 03:05:00,430
the Hand.

2993
03:05:00,430 --> 03:05:01,578
TALIESIN: Let's all push.

2994
03:05:01,578 --> 03:05:02,913
LAURA: As much as we can.

2995
03:05:02,913 --> 03:05:04,223
SAM: Wait, why are we pushing this thing?

2996
03:05:04,223 --> 03:05:10,693
LIAM: Let's do the one and a half elf push, shall
we? You, you, and me.

2997
03:05:10,693 --> 03:05:11,936
LAURA: And Percy.

2998
03:05:11,936 --> 03:05:13,160
TALIESIN: I'll join.

2999
03:05:13,160 --> 03:05:15,313
SAM: I will push, as well.

3000
03:05:15,313 --> 03:05:16,777
LIAM: All the average-shaped people.

3001
03:05:16,777 --> 03:05:18,759
LAURA: I'm rolling my giant foam dice for this.

3002
03:05:18,759 --> 03:05:22,096
MATT: All right. Everyone but Grog can help in
this. Grog, you're out for this one.

3003
03:05:22,096 --> 03:05:24,110
SAM: I'm helping.

3004
03:05:24,110 --> 03:05:25,558
MARISHA: He's helping.

3005
03:05:25,558 --> 03:05:27,091
SAM: I am not helping.

3006
03:05:27,091 --> 03:05:28,568
MARISHA: Ooh, I rolled a 19!

3007
03:05:28,568 --> 03:05:30,489
LIAM: One, eight.

3008
03:05:30,489 --> 03:05:32,276
SAM: 11.

3009
03:05:32,276 --> 03:05:33,828
MARISHA: Wait, is this just a strength check?

3010
03:05:33,828 --> 03:05:35,031
MATT: Yeah, adding your strength.

3011
03:05:35,031 --> 03:05:36,813
MARISHA: Straight strength?

3012
03:05:36,813 --> 03:05:37,842
LAURA: One.

3013
03:05:37,842 --> 03:05:39,391
MARISHA: 21.

3014
03:05:39,391 --> 03:05:40,607
TALIESIN: 12.

3015
03:05:40,607 --> 03:05:42,515
MARISHA: (grunts)

3016
03:05:42,515 --> 03:05:46,509
MATT: As you give it a good solid try, the force
of you guys combined; there is just a lot of

3017
03:05:46,509 --> 03:05:50,343
weight pressed up against this statue with the
crates on the other side. This storage room is

3018
03:05:50,343 --> 03:05:54,939
very full, and you find Vox Machina, for all of
its journeys, battles, victories, and celebratory

3019
03:05:54,939 --> 03:06:02,816
events, bested by a room of clutter. Pike, did you
want to give it a shot?

3020
03:06:02,816 --> 03:06:04,503
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3021
03:06:04,503 --> 03:06:07,102
MARISHA: I turn around and I'm still pushing.

3022
03:06:07,102 --> 03:06:09,025
SAM: Wait, Pike's going to do this?

3023
03:06:09,025 --> 03:06:11,527
MATT: Okay, Pike. Roll a d20 and add your strength
modifier.

3024
03:06:11,527 --> 03:06:13,031
LIAM: Come on, Pike.

3025
03:06:13,031 --> 03:06:15,956
SAM: Doors, man.

3026
03:06:15,956 --> 03:06:17,240
MARISHA: Charge at it.

3027
03:06:17,240 --> 03:06:19,884
LAURA: This is like the lid of a jar; everybody's
loosened it up, and Pike's going to--

3028
03:06:19,884 --> 03:06:20,898
SAM: What?

3029
03:06:20,898 --> 03:06:22,149
ASHLEY: 19.

3030
03:06:22,149 --> 03:06:23,584
MATT: Plus your strength modifier?

3031
03:06:23,584 --> 03:06:26,437
ASHLEY: I rolled an 18 and my strength modifier is
one.

3032
03:06:26,437 --> 03:06:31,376
MATT: All right. As you guys all take a moment to
have this discussion, Pike steps forward, her hair

3033
03:06:31,376 --> 03:06:34,123
drifting behind her, buoyant in the air.

3034
03:06:34,123 --> 03:06:36,051
LIAM: Somebody draw it. Please draw it.

3035
03:06:36,051 --> 03:06:43,205
MATT: She steps up and centers herself. Sets her
shield to the side, puts her mace down, closes her

3036
03:06:43,215 --> 03:06:47,551
eyes, puts her hands on the statue and just
(grunts) begins to shove and push. As she does,

3037
03:06:47,551 --> 03:06:49,615
you guys hear (stone scraping noise).

3038
03:06:49,615 --> 03:06:50,667
LAURA: Seriously?

3039
03:06:50,667 --> 03:06:52,064
TALIESIN: I could have done that.

3040
03:06:52,064 --> 03:06:56,272
MATT: The crates begin to push and move out of the
way, and she pushes the statue a good six feet

3041
03:06:56,272 --> 03:07:00,598
ahead, pushing some of it out of the way, leaving
a little bit of opening and a visual walkway into

3042
03:07:00,598 --> 03:07:02,772
this basement area.

3043
03:07:02,772 --> 03:07:03,865
LAURA: Look at that.

3044
03:07:03,865 --> 03:07:05,662
MARISHA: It must be nice to have the strength of
Sarenrae.

3045
03:07:05,662 --> 03:07:07,599
LAURA: Pike, you saved the day. Again.

3046
03:07:07,599 --> 03:07:11,386
SAM: Mrs. Shorthalt, you are amazing.

3047
03:07:11,386 --> 03:07:14,323
ASHLEY: Whoa, Scanlan.

3048
03:07:14,323 --> 03:07:15,876
TALIESIN: Well, fine.

3049
03:07:15,876 --> 03:07:19,177
MATT: Trinket gives a (grumpy grunt).

3050
03:07:19,177 --> 03:07:22,675
SAM: Pike, will you carry me over the threshold?

3051
03:07:22,675 --> 03:07:24,752
(laughter)

3052
03:07:24,752 --> 03:07:31,048
LIAM: Wait! I fistbump Pike, pop my hood up, and
then quietly go into the room.

3053
03:07:31,048 --> 03:07:31,987
LAURA: Not yet!

3054
03:07:31,987 --> 03:07:33,281
LIAM: Yeah! I'm the best person to do this.

3055
03:07:33,281 --> 03:07:35,042
TRAVIS: Can I have Trinket step on my lower back,
please?

3056
03:07:35,042 --> 03:07:36,932
LAURA: Trinket's really good at that.

3057
03:07:36,932 --> 03:07:41,334
MATT: Trinket is really good at massages. Trinket
begins going, (grunts) stepping on you (cracking)

3058
03:07:41,334 --> 03:07:42,313
and you hear--

3059
03:07:42,313 --> 03:07:44,453
TRAVIS: (groans) Thank god.

3060
03:07:44,453 --> 03:07:46,961
MATT: I'm going to have you roll a stealth
check--

3061
03:07:46,961 --> 03:07:47,993
LIAM: 29 for stealth.

3062
03:07:47,993 --> 03:07:48,958
MATT: With disadvantage.

3063
03:07:48,958 --> 03:07:49,995
LIAM: Disadvantage?

3064
03:07:49,995 --> 03:07:52,437
MATT: Because of Grog's moaning at the massage.

3065
03:07:52,437 --> 03:07:56,233
LIAM: That's fine. That balances out, and my first
roll was a 29 total.

3066
03:07:56,233 --> 03:08:05,593
MATT: (laughs) Okay. All right. You disappear in.
It's very dark in here; there's one sconce that

3067
03:08:05,593 --> 03:08:10,073
appears to be giving a bit of flickering light
across the way. As you step out of this chamber

3068
03:08:10,073 --> 03:08:17,883
into what looks to be two paths that go to the
right and the left and then curve and disappear.

3069
03:08:17,938 --> 03:08:27,330
Right across from you appears to be a central room
or space. You can make a little bit of visual

3070
03:08:27,330 --> 03:08:34,558
around you, but best you can see is there are a
series of bars. Like cells, arranged across some

3071
03:08:34,558 --> 03:08:37,731
of the walls here. You appear to have stumbled
upon the subterranean

3072
03:08:37,731 --> 03:08:40,125
Whitestone dungeon or prison.

3073
03:08:40,125 --> 03:08:43,927
LIAM: Can you help me understand the makeup of it
again? You said two passages-- one to the left,

3074
03:08:43,927 --> 03:08:47,335
one to the right-- and a chamber directly ahead,
between them?

3075
03:08:47,335 --> 03:08:48,469
MATT: Correct.

3076
03:08:48,469 --> 03:08:51,165
LIAM: I know we've got two paths, but he said
there's a room, as well.

3077
03:08:51,165 --> 03:08:53,032
MATT: Here, this will be a good perspective for
you.

3078
03:08:53,032 --> 03:08:55,527
SAM: Oh, you just happen to have the room drawn?

3079
03:08:55,527 --> 03:08:57,374
MATT: That's where you guys came through.

3080
03:08:57,374 --> 03:08:58,418
LIAM: Yeah?

3081
03:08:58,418 --> 03:08:59,738
MATT: And see this path here?

3082
03:08:59,738 --> 03:09:00,566
LAURA: Yeah.

3083
03:09:00,566 --> 03:09:02,905
MATT: And here. And there are cells on this side.

3084
03:09:02,905 --> 03:09:07,899
MARISHA: Is there anything good in the storage
room that we're in?

3085
03:09:07,899 --> 03:09:09,625
MATT: Oh, you're in the storage room?

3086
03:09:09,625 --> 03:09:10,554
MARISHA: Yeah.

3087
03:09:10,554 --> 03:09:11,747
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3088
03:09:11,747 --> 03:09:13,135
LAURA: Yeah, I start opening up crates.

3089
03:09:13,135 --> 03:09:14,207
MATT: Okay.

3090
03:09:14,207 --> 03:09:21,149
MARISHA: That's not great. Eight.

3091
03:09:21,149 --> 03:09:27,678
MATT: There's a lot of broken building materials.

3092
03:09:27,678 --> 03:09:28,790
LAURA: 18.

3093
03:09:28,790 --> 03:09:34,176
MATT: 18? Okay. Looking around, you see there's
work materials. There's pickaxes, there's

3094
03:09:34,176 --> 03:09:42,320
crowbars, there's things that are used in various
tool-based means throughout the uses of a castle.

3095
03:09:42,320 --> 03:09:49,552
Most of them are for grounds repair and things
like that; nothing particularly interests you.

3096
03:09:49,552 --> 03:09:55,350
There are a few crates that have residual
whitestone in them, but it appears that most of it

3097
03:09:55,350 --> 03:09:57,172
has been used or taken elsewhere.

3098
03:09:57,172 --> 03:09:58,582
LAURA: Like whitestone dust?

3099
03:09:58,582 --> 03:10:00,377
MATT: Like dust and small rocks here and there.

3100
03:10:00,377 --> 03:10:02,486
LAURA: Can I gather some up in a bag?

3101
03:10:02,486 --> 03:10:03,565
MATT: Sure.

3102
03:10:03,565 --> 03:10:05,175
MARISHA: Yeah, I pick up a few pieces too.

3103
03:10:05,175 --> 03:10:09,294
MATT: Okay. You, seeing both of those paths--

3104
03:10:09,294 --> 03:10:12,302
LIAM: So both paths, and there's a room closer to
me, right?

3105
03:10:12,431 --> 03:10:15,668
MATT: Yeah, around the way to your left, you see
that's the source of a little bit of sconce

3106
03:10:15,668 --> 03:10:16,751
torchlight.

3107
03:10:16,751 --> 03:10:22,604
LIAM: All right. Into my little earring, I say,
(whispers) I'm not doing anything fucking

3108
03:10:22,604 --> 03:10:30,506
crazy, I'm just going to go ahead. This is the
only thing I can do. And I move quietly into the

3109
03:10:30,506 --> 03:10:32,499
close chamber.

3110
03:10:32,499 --> 03:10:37,130
MATT: Okay, as you're moving forward, you hear
behind you the sound of crates shifting, lids

3111
03:10:37,130 --> 03:10:45,941
moving, because searching through a room of large
clutter and crates makes noise. You take a few

3112
03:10:45,941 --> 03:10:51,623
steps and that happens and you're like, and you
hear echoing from around a corner a voice go,

3113
03:10:51,623 --> 03:10:59,074
"Hello? Is someone there?" This really crackly dry
voice.

3114
03:10:59,074 --> 03:11:03,914
LIAM: I stop moving entirely and I just wait.

3115
03:11:03,914 --> 03:11:08,544
MATT: "Hello?"

3116
03:11:08,544 --> 03:11:13,316
(laughter)

3117
03:11:13,316 --> 03:11:14,951
MATT: Silence.

3118
03:11:14,951 --> 03:11:19,304
LIAM: And can I hear anything besides that?
There's nothing else I hear

3119
03:11:19,304 --> 03:11:21,042
besides that in this room?

3120
03:11:21,042 --> 03:11:22,772
MATT: From what you can tell, no.

3121
03:11:22,772 --> 03:11:24,324
LIAM: There's no dim light or anything?

3122
03:11:24,324 --> 03:11:27,977
MATT: The only dim light is coming from around
that corner, from the source of where that sound

3123
03:11:27,977 --> 03:11:28,873
seemed to come.

3124
03:11:28,873 --> 03:11:32,513
LIAM: Okay. I should be able to see, then, if
there's dim light. Up to 60 feet.

3125
03:11:32,513 --> 03:11:37,506
MATT: Right. Nothing immediately in your visual
perspective. If you go all the way to the edge, you

3126
03:11:37,569 --> 03:11:39,359
can look past the corner if you want.

3127
03:11:39,359 --> 03:11:47,252
LIAM: Okay. I slowly back up away from that and
creep up the hall and stop at the corner before it

3128
03:11:47,252 --> 03:11:49,775
turns and I just lean my head out and I listen.

3129
03:11:49,775 --> 03:11:52,656
MATT: Okay. Perception check.

3130
03:11:52,656 --> 03:11:58,582
LIAM: 27.

3131
03:11:58,582 --> 03:12:03,777
MATT: Okay. Listening for a second, you hear what
sounds like some shifting, like a body shifting

3132
03:12:03,777 --> 03:12:12,050
over some sort of low crumbling. Sounds almost
like grasses or hay or some sort of soft bedding

3133
03:12:12,050 --> 03:12:21,102
is being shifted a little bit. You hear a clink of
metal of some kind, you're not sure quite what the

3134
03:12:21,102 --> 03:12:27,446
source is, and a couple of other small shifting
and grinding sounds of metal. Comes to a halt.

3135
03:12:27,446 --> 03:12:34,392
LIAM: Got it. So I tiptoe all the way back to
everybody and say, listen. Stop doing that.

3136
03:12:34,392 --> 03:12:43,461
Stop. There's two passageways up the way. I think
we're in some sort of dungeon--

3137
03:12:43,461 --> 03:12:45,215
TALIESIN: I could probably confirm this.

3138
03:12:45,215 --> 03:12:49,298
MATT: Very much so. This is where you woke up,
where Cassandra pulled you--

3139
03:12:49,298 --> 03:12:51,676
TALIESIN: This is absolutely the dungeon.

3140
03:12:51,676 --> 03:13:02,427
LIAM: I had surmised as much. There's possibly an
old person in one, and then sounds of something,

3141
03:13:02,427 --> 03:13:07,866
so both of the chambers are occupied. I came back
to confer with you instead of going off on my own

3142
03:13:07,866 --> 03:13:09,029
because that gets me in trouble.

3143
03:13:09,029 --> 03:13:10,827
LAURA: Hey, thank you so much.

3144
03:13:10,827 --> 03:13:12,494
LIAM: One time only.

3145
03:13:12,494 --> 03:13:14,219
SAM: Let's go talk to the old prisoner.

3146
03:13:14,219 --> 03:13:16,194
LIAM: What do you want to do?

3147
03:13:16,194 --> 03:13:17,601
MARISHA: Are we sure they're prisoners?

3148
03:13:17,601 --> 03:13:20,453
LIAM: Do you want to talk to the possibly old
person with the crazy eyes thing?

3149
03:13:20,453 --> 03:13:22,752
TRAVIS: Shouldn't we ask Percy what he wants to
do?

3150
03:13:22,752 --> 03:13:27,636
MATT: You right now are staring off into space,
because you recall the last time you were here you

3151
03:13:27,636 --> 03:13:33,970
woke up in a cell next to a cell that contained a
pile of bodies of previously related members of

3152
03:13:33,970 --> 03:13:36,261
your family before Cassandra ushered you out.

3153
03:13:36,261 --> 03:13:37,915
TALIESIN: I would like to start making my way in
that direction.

3154
03:13:37,915 --> 03:13:41,328
MATT: Okay. So as you guys are having this
conversation, Percy just starts walking--

3155
03:13:41,328 --> 03:13:44,597
LIAM: Percy, you probably want to take out one of
those contraptions of yours.

3156
03:13:44,597 --> 03:13:47,042
LAURA: Wait, before he goes I cast Pass Without a
Trace on everyone.

3157
03:13:47,042 --> 03:13:51,068
MATT: Okay. Everyone who wishes to be stealthy can
be stealthy.

3158
03:13:51,068 --> 03:13:52,900
LIAM: I'm rolling along with Percival.

3159
03:13:52,900 --> 03:13:54,349
TALIESIN: I'm being stealthy.

3160
03:13:54,349 --> 03:13:55,879
MATT: Okay. Everyone roll stealth.

3161
03:13:55,879 --> 03:13:57,528
ASHLEY: Me too, I'm super stealthy.

3162
03:13:57,528 --> 03:14:00,688
MATT: We'll keep with your consistent roll,
currently.

3163
03:14:00,688 --> 03:14:02,761
SAM: 15.

3164
03:14:02,761 --> 03:14:03,998
MATT: Okay. With plus ten?

3165
03:14:03,998 --> 03:14:05,300
SAM: That's with plus ten.

3166
03:14:05,300 --> 03:14:06,721
LIAM: It's 30 this time.

3167
03:14:06,721 --> 03:14:07,704
MATT: All right.

3168
03:14:07,704 --> 03:14:08,903
MARISHA: 21.

3169
03:14:08,903 --> 03:14:11,863
LAURA: Add ten! Because I cast Pass Without a
Trace.

3170
03:14:11,863 --> 03:14:12,994
TALIESIN: 21.

3171
03:14:12,994 --> 03:14:20,983
LIAM: Oh, 40 this time. Only with her.

3172
03:14:20,983 --> 03:14:24,856
MATT: Only it would be like (whoosh) what'd you
get, Grog?

3173
03:14:24,856 --> 03:14:26,080
TRAVIS: 26.

3174
03:14:26,080 --> 03:14:32,759
MATT: Okay. You guys all move as a group forward.
Pike, what'd you get? Yeah, roll your stealth,

3175
03:14:32,759 --> 03:14:34,353
girl. Plus ten to it.

3176
03:14:34,353 --> 03:14:36,284
ASHLEY: (laughs) I have three.

3177
03:14:36,284 --> 03:14:38,077
LAURA: But plus ten!

3178
03:14:38,077 --> 03:14:40,152
LIAM: Can I give her seven of mine?

3179
03:14:40,152 --> 03:14:45,250
MATT: No. You guys push down the left hallway or
the right one?

3180
03:14:45,250 --> 03:14:49,629
TALIESIN: I'm heading towards whichever cell had
been mine.

3181
03:14:49,629 --> 03:14:56,638
MATT: The cell that would've been yours would be
kind of on the opposite side of the room from you,

3182
03:14:56,638 --> 03:15:00,325
on the other side. The fastest way would be taking
the left path towards the light source.

3183
03:15:00,325 --> 03:15:01,737
TALIESIN: The left path.

3184
03:15:01,737 --> 03:15:03,831
MATT: Okay. So you guys head that direction, kind
of following Percy--

3185
03:15:03,831 --> 03:15:05,380
SAM: That's not the direction of the voice.

3186
03:15:05,380 --> 03:15:06,220
LAURA: Yes, it is.

3187
03:15:06,220 --> 03:15:07,266
SAM: Oh, it is?

3188
03:15:07,266 --> 03:15:13,053
MATT: Yeah. You move towards the light. You guys
turn around the corner and look. Not in the cell

3189
03:15:13,053 --> 03:15:16,530
you were in, but across the way, because there are
six cells, three on each side of the hallway

3190
03:15:16,530 --> 03:15:25,441
facing each other, and on the far cell on the
outside-wall side of it, you see there's a torch

3191
03:15:25,441 --> 03:15:31,019
sconce that is lit and just slowly crackling. It's
almost reached ember period, like it's about to be

3192
03:15:31,019 --> 03:15:38,082
changed out, probably. And inside you see, sitting
just squat on the ground, in a cell by herself,

3193
03:15:38,082 --> 03:15:48,411
this woman facing away, back up against the bars
and that's all you can see.

3194
03:15:48,411 --> 03:15:52,357
LIAM: Drawing a blade just in case.

3195
03:15:52,357 --> 03:15:57,364
LAURA: As I approach I put my finger over my mouth
and look at her. Can she see us?

3196
03:15:57,364 --> 03:15:58,676
LIAM: Looking away.

3197
03:15:58,676 --> 03:16:01,071
MATT: She's facing away from you guys, her back is
up against the bars. She's kinda--

3198
03:16:01,071 --> 03:16:02,951
SAM: Psst. Oi. Hello.

3199
03:16:02,951 --> 03:16:04,485
TALIESIN: Shh.

3200
03:16:04,485 --> 03:16:09,067
MATT: Turns her head and looks over, and it's the
first time you see her face. Much older woman,

3201
03:16:09,067 --> 03:16:17,897
probably in her early seventies or so, but
seventies living in a not very-- seventy years in

3202
03:16:17,897 --> 03:16:28,612
a hard life, so very deep, sunken wrinkles. The
skin is very weathered. Her hair is mostly

3203
03:16:28,612 --> 03:16:33,503
whitish-gray with a little bit of you can see
remaining reds and browns in it, at some point she

3204
03:16:33,503 --> 03:16:39,383
might've had much brighter-colored hair. Her
clothing is pretty ragged, and she leans over and

3205
03:16:39,383 --> 03:16:42,123
looks to you guys, squinting her eyes in the
darkness.

3206
03:16:42,123 --> 03:16:44,967
SAM: If you want to get out of here, don't speak
loudly.

3207
03:16:44,967 --> 03:16:48,994
MATT: "All right. Who is this?"

3208
03:16:48,994 --> 03:16:50,866
LAURA: Who are you?

3209
03:16:50,866 --> 03:16:52,361
SAM: We're here to help.

3210
03:16:52,361 --> 03:16:55,085
MATT: She's still kind of looking out into the
darkness. She can't see you guys really. She just

3211
03:16:55,085 --> 03:16:56,144
hears your voices.

3212
03:16:56,144 --> 03:16:59,344
LAURA: Who are you?

3213
03:16:59,344 --> 03:17:05,999
MATT: "Who are you?" She's being very guarded
right now and very spooked.

3214
03:17:05,999 --> 03:17:12,065
LIAM: In the darkness, I hand, stupidly, my
Flametongue dagger to Scanlan again and push him

3215
03:17:12,065 --> 03:17:13,765
forward with it.

3216
03:17:13,765 --> 03:17:21,609
SAM: I hold it up to my face. I grin a big grin to
her and I say, hello. We're friends. We're here

3217
03:17:21,688 --> 03:17:25,190
to bust you out of this place. Will you tell us
who you are?

3218
03:17:25,190 --> 03:17:28,999
MATT: "I'm Gloria. Gloria Cyn."

3219
03:17:28,999 --> 03:17:31,053
SAM: Gloria Cyn?

3220
03:17:31,053 --> 03:17:34,972
MATT: "How'd you find your way in here?"

3221
03:17:34,972 --> 03:17:38,886
SAM: We are ninjas.

3222
03:17:38,886 --> 03:17:47,920
MATT: She looks very confused at you. "Are you
friend or foe? Do you work with the Briarwoods?"

3223
03:17:47,920 --> 03:17:53,124
SAM: No, we are against the Briarwoods and all
they stand for. We're here to save you, the prisoners,

3224
03:17:53,124 --> 03:17:55,944
the village. Everyone we can.

3225
03:17:56,023 --> 03:17:58,512
MATT: Do all of you step forward at this point, or
is it just you?

3226
03:17:58,512 --> 03:18:01,434
LIAM: Just him. Mr. High Charisma.

3227
03:18:01,434 --> 03:18:08,298
SAM: I am not alone. I have friends with me. Some
of whom look quite scary, so don't be alarmed if a

3228
03:18:08,368 --> 03:18:10,355
bear stands right behind me.

3229
03:18:10,527 --> 03:18:11,289
MATT: "A bear?"

3230
03:18:11,289 --> 03:18:12,656
SAM: It's a good bear. It's the best kind of
bear.

3231
03:18:12,656 --> 03:18:14,109
LAURA: He's the cutest.

3232
03:18:14,109 --> 03:18:15,463
MATT: "Who is that?"

3233
03:18:15,463 --> 03:18:19,339
SAM: That's my friend Vex. Vex, come forward.

3234
03:18:19,339 --> 03:18:24,355
LAURA: I walk up a little bit behind Scanlan and I
insight check her to see what

3235
03:18:24,355 --> 03:18:25,594
the fuck is going on.

3236
03:18:25,594 --> 03:18:27,472
MATT: Okay, roll insight.

3237
03:18:27,472 --> 03:18:37,555
LAURA: I don't know, they've all been betraying
me! Don't you. Oh, that's good! 24.

3238
03:18:37,555 --> 03:18:49,433
MATT: 24, okay. I mean, she's in a cell in a
dungeon and looks to be fairly spooked but also

3239
03:18:49,433 --> 03:18:55,469
guarded. Not much to read beyond the fact that
she's an old woman in a dungeon.

3240
03:18:55,469 --> 03:18:57,265
TRAVIS: No?

3241
03:18:57,265 --> 03:19:02,337
MATT: I mean, she's definitely staying guarded in
the circumstance, but you're not picking up any

3242
03:19:02,337 --> 03:19:04,106
sort of strange animosity.

3243
03:19:04,106 --> 03:19:06,211
SAM: Why have you been locked up?

3244
03:19:06,211 --> 03:19:14,489
MATT: And all these voices are coming out of the
darkness, she's like, "I came up from Dryna to ask

3245
03:19:14,489 --> 03:19:22,547
"why the waters are growing brackish. Fish float
downstream, dead, and taste of ash these days.

3246
03:19:22,547 --> 03:19:30,572
"Delilah laughed and threw me in here, saying I'm a
fair better offering than a fisherman. That's the

3247
03:19:30,572 --> 03:19:34,982
"last I know. I've been here for over a week."

3248
03:19:34,982 --> 03:19:36,505
LAURA: A week, that's it?

3249
03:19:36,505 --> 03:19:43,328
TALIESIN: I would say it's almost safer for her
down here for now.

3250
03:19:43,328 --> 03:19:45,348
LAURA: Yeah. So here's the thing.

3251
03:19:45,348 --> 03:19:47,296
SAM: We're great with old people.

3252
03:19:47,296 --> 03:19:50,881
TRAVIS: They don't take prisoners.

3253
03:19:50,881 --> 03:19:53,053
LAURA: There's a lot of violence that's going to
happen.

3254
03:19:53,053 --> 03:19:54,611
SAM: We should unlock that, maybe we should unlock
this cage.

3255
03:19:54,611 --> 03:19:55,558
TALIESIN: No.

3256
03:19:55,558 --> 03:19:56,942
LAURA: No. We should keep her in here for now.

3257
03:19:56,942 --> 03:20:00,078
TRAVIS: Yeah, they don't take prisoners, they
don't take prisoners. Why isn't she fucking dead?

3258
03:20:00,078 --> 03:20:01,030
Or undead?

3259
03:20:01,030 --> 03:20:02,401
SAM: She can run out the tunnel that we came in.

3260
03:20:02,401 --> 03:20:04,409
MARISHA: Yeah, why don't we unlock her and just
let her book for it?

3261
03:20:04,409 --> 03:20:10,969
LIAM: Wait. If we destroy the Briarwoods, it will
be no trouble to come down here and let anyone out

3262
03:20:10,969 --> 03:20:16,582
who's down here. If she's who she says she is, we
don't know.

3263
03:20:16,582 --> 03:20:23,621
SAM: Madam. Good madam. When you were brought into
the castle, can you tell us anything about where

3264
03:20:23,621 --> 03:20:28,778
you were brought? Were you brought before the
queen-- she is a queen, right?

3265
03:20:28,778 --> 03:20:30,027
LAURA: No, she's a lady.

3266
03:20:30,027 --> 03:20:34,727
SAM: Lady. Were you brought before the Lady, and
if so, in what room? Where was it? How big was it?

3267
03:20:34,727 --> 03:20:36,361
How many guards were in there?

3268
03:20:36,361 --> 03:20:49,750
MATT: "They brought me into the main grand throne
chamber to speak with the lord and lady. They

3269
03:20:49,750 --> 03:20:56,048
"ushered me through the halls and we waited about
an hour for them to arrive. Apparently they were

3270
03:20:56,048 --> 03:21:03,611
"busy elsewhere. There was a brief discussion. They
laughed at me and threw me in here."

3271
03:21:03,611 --> 03:21:11,884
SAM: You have beautiful eyes. Did those eyes see
anything in that grand throne room? Entrances or

3272
03:21:11,884 --> 03:21:14,729
exits? Large windows? Anything?

3273
03:21:14,729 --> 03:21:18,539
TALIESIN: I know all of them. I did live here.

3274
03:21:18,539 --> 03:21:27,186
SAM: Oh, fuck. Never mind, Matt. "Were there any
guards? Many guards? Lots of guards?"

3275
03:21:27,186 --> 03:21:37,545
MATT: "There were many guards. I'd heard of dark
things happening in this castle, but when I was

3276
03:21:37,545 --> 03:21:45,862
"escorted through, I saw things in the courtyard,
shambling things, things that should not be alive.

3277
03:21:45,862 --> 03:21:58,785
"Tens, dozens. I did not feel right at that moment,
and then, well, my fate was brought into this

3278
03:21:58,785 --> 03:22:02,852
"terrible cell." She kind of looks about.

3279
03:22:02,852 --> 03:22:05,501
LAURA: Has anybody been coming down and feeding
you?

3280
03:22:05,501 --> 03:22:07,850
MATT: "Every now and then."

3281
03:22:07,850 --> 03:22:09,761
LAURA: Not on a regular basis?

3282
03:22:09,761 --> 03:22:14,073
MATT: "Every day or so they bring enough to
subsist on."

3283
03:22:14,073 --> 03:22:22,619
SAM: As she's talking, I'm going to see if there's
any sort of arcana or magical incantation on her,

3284
03:22:22,619 --> 03:22:25,486
or any sort of possession. Is that something I can
check for?

3285
03:22:25,486 --> 03:22:27,334
MATT: Do you have the Detect Magic spell?

3286
03:22:27,334 --> 03:22:28,226
SAM: No.

3287
03:22:28,226 --> 03:22:29,561
MARISHA: I do.

3288
03:22:29,561 --> 03:22:31,793
SAM: Can I just do an arcana check, or is that
not--

3289
03:22:31,793 --> 03:22:33,317
MATT: I mean, what are you--

3290
03:22:33,317 --> 03:22:34,225
SAM: I don't know.

3291
03:22:34,225 --> 03:22:39,291
MATT: Arcana's more inspecting a close area to see
if there is the nature of an arcane enchantment or

3292
03:22:39,291 --> 03:22:41,299
something on it, you don't actually like sense
it.

3293
03:22:41,299 --> 03:22:45,262
SAM: All right. Then I do nothing. I sing a little
song.

3294
03:22:45,262 --> 03:22:46,933
MATT: What are you doing, Keyleth?

3295
03:22:46,933 --> 03:22:49,305
MARISHA: Nothing.

3296
03:22:49,305 --> 03:22:50,919
LAURA: Can't detect magic?

3297
03:22:50,919 --> 03:22:52,691
MARISHA: I can dispel magic.

3298
03:22:52,691 --> 03:22:53,937
LAURA: Try it.

3299
03:22:53,937 --> 03:22:55,494
TALIESIN: No, because that's a spell.

3300
03:22:55,494 --> 03:22:56,996
MARISHA: It's a spell. It's a 3rd-level spell.

3301
03:22:56,996 --> 03:22:59,505
SAM: She's fine. Let's leave her.

3302
03:22:59,505 --> 03:23:00,865
MARISHA: I mean, I can do it.

3303
03:23:00,865 --> 03:23:03,170
TRAVIS: Why is she not dead? Why is she not
undead?

3304
03:23:03,170 --> 03:23:05,598
TALIESIN: They were going to feed her to
something.

3305
03:23:05,598 --> 03:23:07,337
MARISHA: Yeah, they were going to eat her.

3306
03:23:07,337 --> 03:23:09,009
SAM: Let's feed her to Trinket and go on.

3307
03:23:09,009 --> 03:23:14,268
LIAM: They're not much, but I have rations and a
waterskin. I toss them through

3308
03:23:14,268 --> 03:23:15,791
the bars of her cell.

3309
03:23:15,791 --> 03:23:18,850
MATT: She grabs them as soon as they come through
the cell and grasps them to herself.

3310
03:23:18,850 --> 03:23:20,202
TALIESIN: We'll be back.

3311
03:23:20,202 --> 03:23:21,721
MATT: "You're very kind."

3312
03:23:21,721 --> 03:23:24,502
MARISHA: Do you know if anyone else is in the
dungeon down here with you?

3313
03:23:24,502 --> 03:23:30,448
MATT: "I have not seen or heard anyone else.
Occasional wails, soft, mournful moans, but I stay

3314
03:23:30,448 --> 03:23:32,639
"quiet. I stay very still."

3315
03:23:32,639 --> 03:23:34,966
LAURA: Hide in the corner. Stay quiet.

3316
03:23:34,966 --> 03:23:36,072
MATT: "Would you please let me out?"

3317
03:23:36,072 --> 03:23:39,346
TRAVIS: No, you're fucking staying in that cell,
and if things go bad upstairs it won't matter if

3318
03:23:39,346 --> 03:23:41,091
you're in there or not.

3319
03:23:41,091 --> 03:23:42,870
SAM: If you please.

3320
03:23:42,870 --> 03:23:46,764
TALIESIN: There are things upstairs that we can't
protect you from that

3321
03:23:46,764 --> 03:23:48,637
we are going to deal with first.

3322
03:23:48,637 --> 03:23:52,477
LIAM: And there are creatures on the road and in
the woods and quite frankly you're safer right

3323
03:23:52,477 --> 03:23:56,249
now. If we do what we have come here to do, we
will come back for you.

3324
03:23:56,249 --> 03:23:59,204
TALIESIN: There is war outside right now.

3325
03:23:59,204 --> 03:24:00,539
LAURA: Don't you worry.

3326
03:24:00,539 --> 03:24:02,979
MATT: "If there is war, then that's the time to
leave, when there is distraction."

3327
03:24:02,979 --> 03:24:05,869
SAM: Can you raise a blade? Can you fight?

3328
03:24:05,869 --> 03:24:11,851
MATT: "I can run. I made it up here north, didn't
I? I've lived in these lands for quite some time,

3329
03:24:11,851 --> 03:24:12,895
"I know how to survive."

3330
03:24:12,895 --> 03:24:17,464
LIAM: We can come back for her.

3331
03:24:17,464 --> 03:24:21,481
MATT: "Please. Please don't leave me. I don't know
what's going on."

3332
03:24:21,481 --> 03:24:23,612
LAURA: This is awful.

3333
03:24:23,685 --> 03:24:25,555
TRAVIS: Is it? Leave her.

3334
03:24:25,555 --> 03:24:35,254
MARISHA: Vax, you're the only one who can pick
the lock. We don't have keys. I'm assuming she's

3335
03:24:35,254 --> 03:24:36,666
locked in there, right?

3336
03:24:36,666 --> 03:24:37,857
MATT: You can check the cell door.

3337
03:24:37,857 --> 03:24:43,917
SAM: Let's leave her. Ma'am, you must believe me
when we say you are much safer here than above.

3338
03:24:43,917 --> 03:24:50,022
LIAM: Her fate is intertwined with our own. If she
leaves, she has a very good chance of being

3339
03:24:50,022 --> 03:24:54,604
killed. If we go forward and succeed, we come back
and she lives. If we go forward and she dies,

3340
03:24:54,604 --> 03:24:58,764
she's where she is. This is the best place for
her.

3341
03:24:58,764 --> 03:25:04,627
MATT: "At least take the fate into my own hands. I
don't mean any wrong here, but I have no reason to

3342
03:25:04,627 --> 03:25:09,547
"really trust you, either. How can I show my trust,
how can I--"

3343
03:25:09,547 --> 03:25:11,999
LAURA: You can be quiet.

3344
03:25:11,999 --> 03:25:18,577
MATT: "I can be quiet. Do not leave me here to
waste and die. What if you don't succeed? What if

3345
03:25:18,577 --> 03:25:23,509
"you fall in whatever folly you're making away into
this castle for and I waste away down here myself?

3346
03:25:23,509 --> 03:25:24,422
"Please."

3347
03:25:24,422 --> 03:25:27,531
LIAM: I've just given you food and water. We'll be
back within 24 hours. Come on. We're going.

3348
03:25:27,531 --> 03:25:29,199
TRAVIS: Hold up.

3349
03:25:29,199 --> 03:25:30,292
MATT: "Please."

3350
03:25:30,292 --> 03:25:38,281
SAM: Ma'am. Here. I'm giving you a magical whip.
It will protect you against anyone who comes down

3351
03:25:38,281 --> 03:25:44,287
here. Just hold it up and it will chase away any
demons.

3352
03:25:44,287 --> 03:25:46,519
MATT: You're the only one who's out of the light
now?

3353
03:25:46,519 --> 03:25:47,326
SAM: Yeah.

3354
03:25:47,326 --> 03:25:48,999
LIAM: He was the first one out of the light.

3355
03:25:48,999 --> 03:25:51,850
MATT: Right, but everyone else is still in the
shadow, all these voices coming at her.

3356
03:25:51,850 --> 03:25:56,557
LAURA: She can see me because I went down towards
Scanlan.

3357
03:25:56,557 --> 03:26:00,960
MATT: Okay. She steps a little closer to you as
you're holding the whip out, and she grabs your

3358
03:26:00,960 --> 03:26:08,060
hand with her left hand and kind of pulls it in
and goes, "Please. Don't leave me here. I can fend

3359
03:26:08,060 --> 03:26:10,724
"for my own. Just don't leave me here."

3360
03:26:10,724 --> 03:26:22,106
TRAVIS: I step forward now behind Scanlan. Super
fucking intimidating. If things go well upstairs,

3361
03:26:22,125 --> 03:26:29,539
we'll be back. If when we leave, you make a peep,
you won't ever again.

3362
03:26:29,539 --> 03:26:31,994
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

3363
03:26:31,994 --> 03:26:33,294
TALIESIN: Damn, Grog.

3364
03:26:33,294 --> 03:26:35,146
LIAM: Roll intimidation.

3365
03:26:35,146 --> 03:26:36,633
TRAVIS: 14.

3366
03:26:36,633 --> 03:26:43,155
MATT: She shrinks back. She still hasn't looked
away from you, and she kind of looks at you for a

3367
03:26:43,155 --> 03:26:52,897
second and (heavy sigh) sits down, frustrated, at
the bottom of the cell and just, "Then go. Leave

3368
03:26:52,897 --> 03:26:55,744
"me. Useless."

3369
03:26:55,744 --> 03:26:58,669
TALIESIN: (whispering) Let's check the other
side.

3370
03:26:58,669 --> 03:27:00,371
LIAM: Eat that lembas bread.

3371
03:27:00,371 --> 03:27:02,522
SAM: I take the whip back.

3372
03:27:02,522 --> 03:27:05,142
(laughter)

3373
03:27:05,142 --> 03:27:06,930
TRAVIS: Was it a magical whip or just a rope?

3374
03:27:06,930 --> 03:27:08,544
LAURA: No, it was just his whip.

3375
03:27:08,544 --> 03:27:12,261
TALIESIN: Let's check the other side.

3376
03:27:12,261 --> 03:27:13,726
MATT: Anything else you want to do?

3377
03:27:13,726 --> 03:27:18,228
LIAM: No no no, there's something, I don't know
what, I couldn't make out what I was hearing, it

3378
03:27:18,228 --> 03:27:20,819
sounded like hay or grass moving, so I don't want
to mess with that.

3379
03:27:20,819 --> 03:27:21,786
MARISHA: Someone's sleeping.

3380
03:27:21,786 --> 03:27:24,030
TRAVIS: I think it was the straw on the bottom of
her cell, right?

3381
03:27:24,030 --> 03:27:32,696
LIAM: No, that was her passage. There's another
passage to presumably another set of cells. So I

3382
03:27:32,696 --> 03:27:37,152
will skip along quietly 20 feet ahead of you all.
Try to see.

3383
03:27:37,152 --> 03:27:39,024
SAM: Old people love us.

3384
03:27:39,024 --> 03:27:41,386
LAURA: We're the worst.

3385
03:27:41,386 --> 03:27:45,110
MATT: You skitter around the corner. Go ahead and
make a perception check.

3386
03:27:45,110 --> 03:27:46,374
LIAM: 21.

3387
03:27:46,374 --> 03:27:50,497
MATT: Okay. Looking about the cells, they all
appear to be empty. You do catch a couple of rats

3388
03:27:50,497 --> 03:27:56,053
skittering through some of the brush. Nothing
that really is the source of that

3389
03:27:56,053 --> 03:27:57,311
scraping metal sound.

3390
03:27:57,372 --> 03:27:58,588
LIAM: This is the second room?

3391
03:27:58,588 --> 03:28:01,181
MATT: You go around the way and there's another
set of cells.

3392
03:28:01,181 --> 03:28:02,489
LIAM: Yeah.

3393
03:28:02,544 --> 03:28:03,910
MATT: Nobody else in the other cells.

3394
03:28:03,910 --> 03:28:05,412
LIAM: This is where I heard something before.

3395
03:28:05,412 --> 03:28:08,757
MATT: You heard it echoing around the other
hallway, so it could be amorphously from the same

3396
03:28:08,757 --> 03:28:12,045
source that she came from, or near the cell.

3397
03:28:12,045 --> 03:28:16,482
LIAM: And my perception. Vex, come up here and
look around.

3398
03:28:16,552 --> 03:28:18,087
LAURA: I sneak up.

3399
03:28:18,087 --> 03:28:19,849
LIAM: I don't see anything, but I feel like
something's here.

3400
03:28:19,849 --> 03:28:21,411
LAURA: Can we sense anything?

3401
03:28:21,411 --> 03:28:23,421
SAM: By the way, how long has this all taken?

3402
03:28:23,421 --> 03:28:27,399
MATT: Since you left the symbol up there?

3403
03:28:27,399 --> 03:28:31,145
SAM: The tunnel, left the lady, the tunnel. Since
we've incited the rebellion.

3404
03:28:31,145 --> 03:28:32,522
MATT: 20 minutes.

3405
03:28:32,522 --> 03:28:35,399
SAM: Jesus. We've got to start cooking, guys.

3406
03:28:35,399 --> 03:28:39,749
LIAM: Pike, do you, is there anything here, do you
sense anything in this room?

3407
03:28:39,749 --> 03:28:43,763
ASHLEY: (sighs) No, I feel weird about this old
woman.

3408
03:28:43,763 --> 03:28:45,741
TRAVIS: Yeah. Me, too.

3409
03:28:45,741 --> 03:28:51,651
LIAM: All right, so there was dungeon and dungeon,
set of cells and set of cells, but you said--

3410
03:28:51,651 --> 03:28:55,242
MATT: Yeah, there is, past her cells, a--

3411
03:28:55,242 --> 03:28:56,851
TALIESIN: Yay, map.

3412
03:28:56,851 --> 03:29:00,329
LAURA: We're not getting to see it yet.

3413
03:29:00,329 --> 03:29:03,222
MATT: Now that you've been through this whole
thing, you can see now--

3414
03:29:03,222 --> 03:29:04,448
LAURA: Ta-da!

3415
03:29:04,448 --> 03:29:07,213
TALIESIN: Let's memorize where we're all going to
die.

3416
03:29:07,213 --> 03:29:12,127
MATT: She's in this cell over here. You've come
around here and you can see there are two cells

3417
03:29:12,127 --> 03:29:17,317
this way, a cell this way, and then these sets of
cells. There is a stairway that curves upward--

3418
03:29:17,378 --> 03:29:19,085
MARISHA: Yeah, which one was the old lady in?

3419
03:29:19,085 --> 03:29:20,791
MATT: This one right there.

3420
03:29:20,791 --> 03:29:22,639
LAURA: I think we should let her out.

3421
03:29:22,639 --> 03:29:24,995
ASHLEY: Did you guys give her something to eat?

3422
03:29:24,995 --> 03:29:26,834
LAURA: Yeah, we gave her food and water.

3423
03:29:26,834 --> 03:29:28,148
LIAM: I gave her food and water.

3424
03:29:28,148 --> 03:29:29,433
ASHLEY: Did she eat it?

3425
03:29:29,433 --> 03:29:30,962
LIAM: She scrabbled at it.

3426
03:29:30,962 --> 03:29:33,196
MATT: She brought it to her, but she didn't eat it
immediately, no.

3427
03:29:33,196 --> 03:29:35,703
TRAVIS: Because she's not hungry, because she
hasn't been in there for a while.

3428
03:29:35,703 --> 03:29:36,989
ASHLEY: We didn't see her eat it?

3429
03:29:36,989 --> 03:29:37,831
LAURA: No.

3430
03:29:37,831 --> 03:29:39,480
MARISHA: Is there, do we see anyone else in any of
the cells?

3431
03:29:39,480 --> 03:29:40,259
MATT: No.

3432
03:29:40,259 --> 03:29:43,473
LIAM: At this point, I grab my sister and I say,
Come on, we're going to check the cells. And we

3433
03:29:43,473 --> 03:29:45,122
look at every single one of them.

3434
03:29:45,122 --> 03:29:49,582
MATT: Okay, you go through every cell. There is
nobody living in them. You do see a few of the

3435
03:29:49,582 --> 03:29:55,832
cells have long-decomposed corpses. Piles of
bones, mostly picked clean by the rats or whatever

3436
03:29:55,832 --> 03:30:02,056
creatures live in here. But from your best
knowledge of decomposition through your

3437
03:30:02,056 --> 03:30:07,535
experiences, nothing fresher than like the past
year, maybe.

3438
03:30:07,619 --> 03:30:12,633
TRAVIS: I walk back up to the old woman. Not
hungry or thirsty, I take it?

3439
03:30:12,715 --> 03:30:14,628
ASHLEY: I'm going to go with Grog.

3440
03:30:14,628 --> 03:30:19,448
MATT: (laughs) Okay. She goes, "I was fed naught
but this morning, I have to make this last."

3441
03:30:19,448 --> 03:30:21,303
TRAVIS: Keep you well-fed here, do they?

3442
03:30:21,303 --> 03:30:25,802
MATT: "No. But if you eat it all at once, you have
nothing to keep you over until the next time."

3443
03:30:25,802 --> 03:30:31,842
TRAVIS: Yeah, have a little nibble.

3444
03:30:31,842 --> 03:30:34,728
MATT: She gives you a strange look.

3445
03:30:34,728 --> 03:30:36,992
TRAVIS: Have a little nibble.

3446
03:30:37,046 --> 03:30:39,740
MATT: Takes some of the rations and breaks it off.

3447
03:30:39,740 --> 03:30:42,055
TRAVIS: It's good.

3448
03:30:42,055 --> 03:30:49,414
MATT: "It's not the finest of stone fish, but
it'll do."

3449
03:30:49,414 --> 03:30:52,702
SAM: Cooking with Grog!

3450
03:30:52,702 --> 03:30:55,188
(laughter)

3451
03:30:55,188 --> 03:30:56,502
TALIESIN: Old people love us.

3452
03:30:56,502 --> 03:30:58,260
LAURA: Yeah, we're just the worst to old people.

3453
03:30:58,260 --> 03:31:00,576
MATT: "Why are you so spiteful, giant man?"

3454
03:31:00,576 --> 03:31:03,682
TRAVIS: Because I don't trust you, old woman.

3455
03:31:03,682 --> 03:31:14,935
ASHLEY: Can I quietly prick a little hole into my
palm, just so I can start bleeding a little bit?

3456
03:31:14,935 --> 03:31:16,450
Just very tiny?

3457
03:31:16,450 --> 03:31:20,319
MATT: Could I ask what for?

3458
03:31:20,319 --> 03:31:21,851
ASHLEY: What was that?

3459
03:31:21,851 --> 03:31:23,142
MATT: Could I ask what for?

3460
03:31:23,142 --> 03:31:24,549
TRAVIS: That's a great idea.

3461
03:31:24,549 --> 03:31:30,894
MATT: Unfortunately, your form here is
incorporeal, there is no blood flow from your

3462
03:31:30,894 --> 03:31:32,224
current body.

3463
03:31:32,224 --> 03:31:35,237
ASHLEY: Fuck. I just want to see if she's a
vampire.

3464
03:31:35,461 --> 03:31:36,530
LIAM: In Vasselheim there is.

3465
03:31:36,530 --> 03:31:37,886
MATT: Back in Vasselheim there is, yes.

3466
03:31:37,886 --> 03:31:39,146
ASHLEY: All right, Grog, maybe?

3467
03:31:39,146 --> 03:31:41,292
LIAM: Grog, do you get any ideas watching her do
that?

3468
03:31:41,292 --> 03:31:47,787
TRAVIS: Yeah, I fucking bite into the meat of my
hand because I see what she's trying to do.

3469
03:31:47,787 --> 03:31:48,727
MATT: Okay.

3470
03:31:48,727 --> 03:31:49,882
TRAVIS: Just (chomp).

3471
03:31:49,882 --> 03:31:52,347
MATT: "What's wrong with you?"

3472
03:31:52,347 --> 03:31:59,816
TRAVIS: Drip a little. Oh no. Some nice type AB.
Right here. On tap.

3473
03:31:59,892 --> 03:32:04,141
MATT: She turns her head curiously and looks
disgusted and disturbed by this display.

3474
03:32:04,141 --> 03:32:05,169
TRAVIS: No?

3475
03:32:05,169 --> 03:32:06,432
MATT: Very confused.

3476
03:32:06,432 --> 03:32:12,863
TRAVIS: Clean blood. Feel yourself tempted?

3477
03:32:12,863 --> 03:32:17,351
MATT: "I know not which madness has taken you."

3478
03:32:17,433 --> 03:32:19,194
LAURA: Let's get the fuck out of here.

3479
03:32:19,330 --> 03:32:20,424
LIAM: We're making asses of ourselves.

3480
03:32:20,424 --> 03:32:25,250
MATT: "Please. Please, I implore you, just open
these gates. Let me fare for my own fate."

3481
03:32:25,250 --> 03:32:30,983
LIAM: Yes, the answer to that is no. We'll be
back, I'm going to go creep up the stairs.

3482
03:32:30,983 --> 03:32:32,548
MATT: "She. You. You, please."

3483
03:32:32,619 --> 03:32:35,355
LAURA: I can't pick a lock. I mean, I can try.

3484
03:32:35,355 --> 03:32:38,460
LIAM: I'm moving towards those stairs.

3485
03:32:38,460 --> 03:32:41,035
MATT: Okay, Vax walks towards the stairs. The rest
of you guys?

3486
03:32:41,090 --> 03:32:42,920
SAM: Doors and old people.

3487
03:32:42,920 --> 03:32:49,761
LAURA: I'm going to act like I'm trying to pick
the lock and help her. But I'm going to not try

3488
03:32:49,761 --> 03:32:57,489
very hard. I'm putting on a show for her. Oh,
this is a really difficult lock.

3489
03:32:57,489 --> 03:33:00,731
MATT: Okay, as you're going for the lock, she
rushes up and helps you with it and is holding,

3490
03:33:00,731 --> 03:33:03,839
like, "Yes, yes, please, just like that. All
right."

3491
03:33:03,839 --> 03:33:05,507
LAURA: And then what?

3492
03:33:05,507 --> 03:33:08,408
MATT: "You turn it this way. You don't have the
proper tools for this--"

3493
03:33:08,408 --> 03:33:12,827
LAURA: I snap the thing into the lock. Oh no. I
knew I shouldn't have done that.

3494
03:33:12,827 --> 03:33:14,613
MATT: "Foolish girl!"

3495
03:33:14,613 --> 03:33:21,107
LAURA: I just don't know what I'm doing, but I
will be back with someone who does.

3496
03:33:21,107 --> 03:33:22,587
MATT: Make a perception check.

3497
03:33:22,587 --> 03:33:23,634
SAM: Perception?

3498
03:33:23,634 --> 03:33:24,545
MARISHA: Perception?

3499
03:33:24,545 --> 03:33:26,916
SAM: Oh shit, because she's going to turn into
something.

3500
03:33:26,970 --> 03:33:30,764
LAURA: Oh, that's really good. 26.

3501
03:33:30,764 --> 03:33:38,939
MATT: 26. When she went up and grabbed the lock
with you, her hands grabbed the lock. You only

3502
03:33:38,939 --> 03:33:43,459
felt one hand.

3503
03:33:43,459 --> 03:33:47,510
MARISHA: Oh my god, it's Ripley! Oh my god, it's
Ripley! Sorry.

3504
03:33:47,510 --> 03:33:49,176
MATT: You're not there.

3505
03:33:49,176 --> 03:33:54,268
MARISHA: I'm saying that as Marisha. Not as
Keyleth. Saying that as a person.

3506
03:33:54,268 --> 03:33:55,625
MATT: The worst.

3507
03:33:55,625 --> 03:33:56,864
MARISHA: I'm sorry.

3508
03:33:56,864 --> 03:33:58,211
MATT: But anyway.

3509
03:33:58,211 --> 03:34:02,151
LIAM: Shush, you don't know anything, shut up.

3510
03:34:02,151 --> 03:34:04,291
MATT: We are going to leave it there--

3511
03:34:04,291 --> 03:34:06,782
(shouting)

3512
03:34:06,782 --> 03:34:09,433
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

3513
03:34:09,433 --> 03:34:11,368
ASHLEY: Wait, who's Ripley?

3514
03:34:11,368 --> 03:34:14,199
(laughter)

3515
03:34:14,199 --> 03:34:16,405
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

3516
03:34:16,405 --> 03:34:18,982
LIAM: They mostly come out at night. Mostly.

3517
03:34:18,982 --> 03:34:22,101
LAURA: Ashley, we're going to have to tell you so
much.

3518
03:34:22,101 --> 03:34:23,311
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

3519
03:34:23,311 --> 03:34:25,418
ASHLEY: I'll try to catch up, too.

3520
03:34:25,418 --> 03:34:31,027
MATT: So now Whitestone Castle has been
infiltrated, the real path to the seeming end is

3521
03:34:31,027 --> 03:34:35,624
on. We will continue this next week Thursday.

3522
03:34:35,624 --> 03:34:37,364
ASHLEY: Wait, we're stopping?

3523
03:34:37,364 --> 03:34:38,604
MATT: Yeah, we're stopping.

3524
03:34:38,604 --> 03:34:39,722
SAM: You've got to go to sleep.

3525
03:34:39,722 --> 03:34:41,291
LAURA: You've got to get picked up in like an
hour.

3526
03:34:41,291 --> 03:34:42,985
MATT: When do you have to be on set, Ashley?

3527
03:34:42,985 --> 03:34:46,938
ASHLEY: My pick up is at 5AM.

3528
03:34:46,938 --> 03:34:48,545
MARISHA: Oh my god, Ashley.

3529
03:34:48,545 --> 03:34:50,536
TALIESIN: So what time is it there right now?

3530
03:34:50,536 --> 03:34:52,205
MARISHA: It's one, no, 2AM there.

3531
03:34:52,205 --> 03:34:54,669
ASHLEY: It's almost 2AM.

3532
03:34:54,669 --> 03:34:55,590
LAURA: Ashley!

3533
03:34:55,590 --> 03:35:01,372
MATT: Ashley... See that's, that's a true friend
player right there, guys.

3534
03:35:01,372 --> 03:35:02,861
MARISHA: It's just pick-ups, right?

3535
03:35:02,861 --> 03:35:06,843
MATT: I know. Well thank you, Ashley, for joining
us. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it.

3536
03:35:06,843 --> 03:35:07,753
ASHLEY: Ah, shit.

3537
03:35:07,753 --> 03:35:08,643
LAURA: Ashley, we love you.

3538
03:35:08,643 --> 03:35:09,547
TALIESIN: Love you so much.

3539
03:35:09,547 --> 03:35:11,018
ASHLEY: All right, I love you guys so much.

3540
03:35:11,018 --> 03:35:12,556
MARISHA: We love you, Ashley, please come back
next week.
