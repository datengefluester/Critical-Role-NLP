1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,065
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,065 --> 00:00:07,083
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons, or are a little late on the

3
00:00:07,083 --> 00:00:12,853
draw when shouting the phrase out, Travis
Willingham. (laughs) Anyway, before we get into

4
00:00:12,853 --> 00:00:19,190
tonight's episode, let's go ahead and jump into
our announcements. Let's see here, we've got a new

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,299
game called Injustice 2 that just came out.

6
00:00:21,299 --> 00:00:22,764
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Yeah!

7
00:00:22,764 --> 00:00:25,846
LAURA: Wait a minute. What is this Injustice 2 you
speak of?

8
00:00:25,846 --> 00:00:31,076
TRAVIS: Is that the shapes and pie-making game
that you play in the kitchen bakery?

9
00:00:31,076 --> 00:00:32,557
MARISHA: It's like Cooking Mama.

10
00:00:32,557 --> 00:00:37,128
LAURA: I watched a video today of you and you
fighting, which was pretty exciting.

11
00:00:37,128 --> 00:00:39,098
MATT: Yeah, we have all the Flashes covered, I
think.

12
00:00:39,098 --> 00:00:41,569
TALIESIN: All of the Flashes are on this show.

13
00:00:41,569 --> 00:00:43,165
LAURA: That's crazy.

14
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:44,227
MATT: So who do you guys play?

15
00:00:44,227 --> 00:00:45,681
TALIESIN: I play Barry Allen.

16
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:47,808
LIAM: I play Reverse-Flash. What's his name?

17
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:49,584
TALIESIN: Eobard Thawne.

18
00:00:49,584 --> 00:00:50,798
LIAM: Right.

19
00:00:50,798 --> 00:00:52,194
LAURA: I play Supergirl!

20
00:00:52,235 --> 00:00:55,538
TRAVIS: I play Tim Garrick.

21
00:00:55,538 --> 00:00:57,274
TALIESIN: Jay Garrick.

22
00:00:57,274 --> 00:01:02,266
TRAVIS: Jay Garrick. I wear a tin pail for a
helmet.

23
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:03,788
MATT: It's pretty slick.

24
00:01:03,788 --> 00:01:08,640
TRAVIS: The one Flash I don't know, really.

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,932
MATT: Next Halloween, man. Just saying. I'd love a
picture of you wearing that hat.

26
00:01:13,932 --> 00:01:15,411
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

27
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:16,619
ASHLEY: Yes, please.

28
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,219
MATT: Please. It'll be great. And I play Deadshot.
Yeah, check it out, it looks really good. They had

29
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:25,148
us all do really intense facial motion capture
which is even funnier, considering that my

30
00:01:25,148 --> 00:01:27,493
character wears a mask the whole time.

31
00:01:27,493 --> 00:01:29,028
TRAVIS: Did they really make you do that?

32
00:01:29,028 --> 00:01:30,092
MATT and TALIESIN: Yeah.

33
00:01:30,092 --> 00:01:31,212
TRAVIS: With a mask?

34
00:01:31,212 --> 00:01:32,789
MATT: Well, not with a mask on my face, but yeah.

35
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:34,470
TALIESIN: That would've been even better.

36
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,253
MATT: I assume there'll be a DLC costume where he
doesn't have a mask, or they just did it to fuck

37
00:01:39,253 --> 00:01:41,886
with me, which I respect either way.

38
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:44,830
TRAVIS: They're in the booth, going (whispers)
we're not getting any of this!

39
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,129
TALIESIN: Don't tell him! Let it roll.

40
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:51,671
TRAVIS: Just draw a dick-butt on his forehead;
it's fine.

41
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:54,629
LAURA: Those bright lights are headache-inducing,
yeah.

42
00:01:54,683 --> 00:02:01,360
MATT: So check it out. It's out now, it's fun!
What I've seen of it looks actually really cool.

43
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,226
TALIESIN: I've played a little; it's fun.

44
00:02:03,226 --> 00:02:08,035
MATT: They got their RPG in my fighting game,
and that's right up my alley. All right, also,

45
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:15,730
because it's coming up real fast, reminder,
MomoCon, May 25th to the 28th. MoMocon! Taliesin,

46
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,162
Marisha, myself, and Brian W. Foster are going to
be there for a Talks Machina panel, as well as

47
00:02:20,162 --> 00:02:22,888
other events throughout the weekend, so look
forward to seeing you there in Atlanta, Georgia,

48
00:02:22,888 --> 00:02:28,691
weekend after this one. Also, I will be at A-Kon
once again, June 8th to the 11th in Fort Worth,

49
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:35,507
Texas. Come say hello to me there. And then,
remember that Talks Machina is live on Tuesdays at

50
00:02:35,507 --> 00:02:42,451
7PM Pacific Time here on Twitch and Alpha. The
submission email has changed, so to submit your

51
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:50,893
gif and/or fanart of the week, use
submit@talksmachina.com. So that is submit,

52
00:02:50,893 --> 00:02:59,044
submit! One submit, not two, that's just my
psychosis. Submit@talksmachina.com. Yes. Anything

53
00:02:59,044 --> 00:03:02,769
else anyone wants to talk about, are we good? Move
on to the game for the night.

54
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:11,179
LAURA: Oh! Farpoint came out. So if you have
PlayStation Virtual Reality System, then you can

55
00:03:11,179 --> 00:03:15,387
get Farpoint, and I play Dr. Eva Tyson on it, and
it's actually a really freaking cool game.

56
00:03:15,387 --> 00:03:18,576
TRAVIS: It's fun, you shoot things with a gun. Do
you have to get the gun for it?

57
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:21,191
LAURA: You shoot things with a gun, and it was a
really cool script and stuff.

58
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:23,213
I liked the story a lot.

59
00:03:23,213 --> 00:03:24,965
LIAM: That's not how guns work.

60
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:26,784
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Are we talking about next
week?

61
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:28,133
MATT: Oh, yeah, we should say that, too.

62
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:29,291
MARISHA: That's a big one.

63
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:34,102
MATT: That wasn't on the list. So yeah. So we're
missing two cast members next week.

64
00:03:34,102 --> 00:03:37,164
TRAVIS: Guess who's not here.

65
00:03:37,164 --> 00:03:42,129
MATT: What? That's terrible.

66
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:44,922
ASHLEY: Hey!

67
00:03:44,922 --> 00:03:49,687
MATT: But given the circumstance, instead, we're
going to have a non-numbered episode next week,

68
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:54,220
instead it looks like we're going to throw in for
a new, higher-level battle royale for those who

69
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,406
will be here to see how some of these high-level
abilities function.

70
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:02,980
MARISHA: You won't be there to put my face in lava
this time! I'll just have myself to do that.

71
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,142
ASHLEY: I know, you guys, I won't be there, so.

72
00:04:05,142 --> 00:04:07,259
TRAVIS: Will Friedle won the first one, she won
the last one.

73
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:08,456
LAURA: I've never done it.

74
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,715
SAM: I've never done it, either.

75
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:11,614
LAURA: Oh no. And you're doing it as Tary?

76
00:04:11,614 --> 00:04:13,431
MATT: It's up to you; you get to choose.

77
00:04:13,431 --> 00:04:16,108
MARISHA: Are you going to bring back Scanlan?

78
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:20,384
SAM: All right, Taryon's going to die in like five
seconds.

79
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:22,168
(laughter)

80
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:25,083
TALIESIN: So if we loot Tary's body, do we get all
of his stuff?

81
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,039
MATT: It's not in canon.

82
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:27,516
TALIESIN: No, even not in canon, in the game.

83
00:04:27,516 --> 00:04:30,509
MATT: Oh, if you go to his body after he's dead,
you can grab any of his shit to use it.

84
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:32,809
TALIESIN: You are a loot drop, oh my god.

85
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:35,410
MATT: As long as it's not attunement, you can use
it.

86
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,996
LAURA: Is the helmet attuned? It is, isn't it?

87
00:04:37,996 --> 00:04:39,230
MATT: I believe it is, yes.

88
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,273
SAM: Probably, yeah.

89
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:42,602
LAURA: Too bad. But we can just steal all of his
jewels just for the sake of it.

90
00:04:42,602 --> 00:04:44,861
MATT: There you go. In the alternate universe
version, you are just decked out.

91
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:46,434
SAM: Do I get Doty in the fight?

92
00:04:46,434 --> 00:04:47,234
MATT: Yeah.

93
00:04:47,234 --> 00:04:48,630
SAM: Okay. That helps.

94
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,942
MATT: And you'll be leveled up to their level.

95
00:04:49,942 --> 00:04:51,974
SAM: And I'll be leveled up to their level?

96
00:04:51,974 --> 00:04:53,218
MATT: For the battle royale, yeah.

97
00:04:53,218 --> 00:04:54,948
TALIESIN: Yeah, we level up for that.

98
00:04:54,948 --> 00:05:01,569
MATT: Anyway, that'll be next week. That pushes
our hundredth episode to June 8th. And it looks

99
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:04,464
like we're confirmed for June 1st for our next
guest, I believe.

100
00:05:04,464 --> 00:05:09,583
SAM: Yes. Yes, we are. We are confirmed for that.
Are we announcing that?

101
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,022
MATT: Yeah, sure. Yeah.

102
00:05:11,022 --> 00:05:16,922
SAM: Oh, well, yeah, on June 1st, our next guest,
Jon Heder AKA Napoleon Dynamite, is going to come

103
00:05:16,922 --> 00:05:22,041
play with us and roll some dice. Yeah.

104
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,330
MARISHA: My mother has never been so proud of me.

105
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,274
LAURA: So, did we already say that because next
week is a battle royale,

106
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:29,707
that means our hundredth episode--

107
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:30,748
MATT: Is pushed to the 8th, yes.

108
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:32,697
LAURA: Okay, you already said that? Was I busy
rolling dice and talking?

109
00:05:32,697 --> 00:05:40,504
MATT: You were. But thank you, Laura. Good looking
out. I appreciate that. So yeah, I think that's

110
00:05:40,504 --> 00:05:44,850
all the major news, and given that, let's go ahead
and dive in to

111
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,163
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

112
00:05:48,163 --> 00:07:16,291
[dramatic music]

113
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:26,944
MATT: Hello and welcome back, everybody. So last
time where we left off, Vox Machina, upon working

114
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:33,891
on their bakery, the Slayer's Cake in Whitestone,
made a possible new hire who turned out to be a

115
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:42,425
drow bounty hunter named K'rynn, who was sent here
to acquire Taryon Darrington and bring him back

116
00:07:42,425 --> 00:07:50,833
home to the city of Deastok In Wildmount. You guys
all, through a series of high-level magic scrying

117
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:57,618
and transportation, managed to cut off this
specific bounty hunter on the outskirts of the

118
00:07:57,618 --> 00:08:05,120
city, and in doing so made an agreement to not
slay her where she stood, and instead possibly

119
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:12,389
make a transaction down the road. You guys then
made your way into the city of Deastok to the

120
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:23,072
Darrington Estate and were led up into the study
of Howaardt Darrington, father of Taryon, in which

121
00:08:23,072 --> 00:08:29,437
you all discussed the reasons of why he was
brought back, the current financial state of the

122
00:08:29,437 --> 00:08:42,141
family, and the intent to resolve and remedy
long-standing sins of the father, through you

123
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:47,271
standing up and doing your family duty, from his
perspective. We left off as you guys had just

124
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:53,798
finished that conversation. You've exited his study
and were about to go about your business. Coming

125
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:59,812
off the tension of the conversation, you closed
behind you with a clack the heavy wooden doors of

126
00:08:59,812 --> 00:09:09,654
Howaardt's study. There you have Bertholt, who's
standing off to the side, the dragonborn servant

127
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:17,944
of the Darrington family, waiting patiently, and you
all at this moment are at your own disposal. What

128
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,484
do you wish to do?

129
00:09:19,484 --> 00:09:30,550
SAM: Just before we move: the names that Dad had
told us about to maybe parlay with in the Myriad?

130
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,916
LAURA: Korshad.

131
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:33,103
SAM: Korshad?

132
00:09:33,103 --> 00:09:35,045
MATT: Korshad, yes.

133
00:09:35,045 --> 00:09:40,625
TRAVIS: And how much was the debt? It was
260,000?

134
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,073
SAM: 230,000!

135
00:09:42,073 --> 00:09:44,505
MATT: 230,000 gold debt.

136
00:09:44,505 --> 00:09:47,329
SAM: But wait, wasn't there some other name, the
little--

137
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:49,449
TRAVIS: Lydia!

138
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:58,131
MATT: Lydia was who you are to be betrothed to,
and the location was the Grumpy Lily.

139
00:09:58,169 --> 00:10:04,829
MARISHA: I was questioning myself, I was like
there was no way something

140
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:06,630
was called the Grumpy Lily.

141
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,731
MATT: Had a stroke while taking notes in D&D.
Grumpy Lily!

142
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,825
LAURA: The Many is who we want to speak to.

143
00:10:11,825 --> 00:10:19,593
TALIESIN: Just as something that happened, during
that whole family conversation I was scanning the

144
00:10:19,593 --> 00:10:24,475
room and the bookshelves for anything interesting,
anything out of sorts, anything out of place.

145
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:27,537
MATT: Make a retroactive perception check.

146
00:10:27,537 --> 00:10:29,763
SAM: A retroactive perception check!

147
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:34,939
TALIESIN: I didn't want to-- yeah, I didn't see
shit. I just rolled a three; that's nothing.

148
00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:36,944
MATT: Rightly so!

149
00:10:36,944 --> 00:10:41,972
SAM: Retrograde! You know they always say that
retrograde perception is 20/20?

150
00:10:41,972 --> 00:10:43,166
MATT: What?

151
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:46,944
TALIESIN: I appreciate what you were going for
there.

152
00:10:46,944 --> 00:11:02,110
SAM: Anyway, I would love to ask Bertholt if he
knows the location of my sister.

153
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:10,495
MATT: "Well, if you are looking for Maryanne,
she's probably in her chambers."

154
00:11:10,552 --> 00:11:18,221
SAM: All right, well, I mean I guess we can <i>all</i>
walk to her room and knock on the door. It's a

155
00:11:18,221 --> 00:11:19,613
little weird, right?

156
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:22,193
LIAM: You want to go talk to her and touch base
with her first?

157
00:11:22,193 --> 00:11:23,702
You can introduce us to her after.

158
00:11:23,702 --> 00:11:31,048
SAM: Sure. I'll lead them back downstairs to that
main room that was all awful and terrible, right?

159
00:11:31,048 --> 00:11:34,796
MATT: Well, it was just dark and cold and empty.

160
00:11:34,796 --> 00:11:42,943
SAM: So I'll lead them down there. This was our
playroom, maybe you should just wait here and I'll

161
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:45,397
go talk to sis. I'll be right back.

162
00:11:45,397 --> 00:11:46,895
LAURA: All right.

163
00:11:46,895 --> 00:11:49,163
TRAVIS: Is there like furniture to sit on, or is
it barren?

164
00:11:49,163 --> 00:11:53,655
MATT: No, no. There's furniture, and a lot of the
furniture here is really well made, dark woods,

165
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:57,708
fine deep red and maroon fabrics. A lot of it has
dust on it.

166
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,539
TALIESIN: Plastic covers? No plastic covers?

167
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:04,018
MATT: No plastic covers. But some of the
furniture here is for use and some of it is here just

168
00:12:04,018 --> 00:12:06,736
as part of the decor, and it's very easy to see
which ones are which.

169
00:12:06,798 --> 00:12:09,243
LAURA: I'm definitely going to sit on the ones
that are just for decor.

170
00:12:09,243 --> 00:12:10,951
MATT: Okay, they're really uncomfortable.

171
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,452
LAURA: Cool. Going to rub my butt all over it.

172
00:12:13,452 --> 00:12:22,998
MATT: You leave a little butt-print in the dust.
Perfect. At which point, Bertholt acknowledges

173
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:30,336
that you guys will be staying. "Could I get
anything for you? Perhaps teas, juice, water?"

174
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:33,009
TRAVIS: What is this bullshit, no ale?

175
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:35,617
LAURA: Do you have fermented juice?

176
00:12:35,617 --> 00:12:41,959
MATT: "I'll fetch the wine." And he hobbles off to
acquire some means of imbibement.

177
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:46,689
TRAVIS: Should we pay him? We just found out he's
dead fucking broke.

178
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:50,016
LAURA: I'd rather not.

179
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:51,773
TRAVIS: Okay.

180
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:54,254
(laughter)

181
00:12:54,254 --> 00:13:00,587
MATT: Okay. You make your way back to the second
floor and off to the far western end of the

182
00:13:00,587 --> 00:13:08,524
estate, to what you recall being Maryanne's
chambers. So as you enter her room, which has

183
00:13:08,524 --> 00:13:18,824
become her own study, as you recall last time
seeing her, her room was becoming more and more of a

184
00:13:18,824 --> 00:13:26,865
functional office, and as you knock and push the
door open like a familiar brother does, not

185
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:34,709
wishing for any patience on her end, necessarily,
you can see the interiors. The bed's there for function.

186
00:13:34,764 --> 00:13:41,433
Most if it is, I wouldn't say a replica, but it very
much resembles the decor and mood of your father's

187
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:51,213
study. You see her currently sitting at a desk in
the corner. Her blonde hair is tied back in a

188
00:13:51,213 --> 00:13:57,494
tied braid that runs down her back. She wears a
coat and pants and seems to be dressed a little

189
00:13:57,494 --> 00:14:02,771
formally or businesslike for being casually at
home. You haven't really seen her dress like this

190
00:14:02,771 --> 00:14:10,862
before, at least not in a casual circumstance. As
you glance over past the doorway she looks up from

191
00:14:10,862 --> 00:14:16,929
her papers and goes, "Brother!"

192
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:19,749
SAM: Hello, sister.

193
00:14:19,749 --> 00:14:25,581
MATT: "Brother, what--" She closes the book. You
can see she's been looking over ledgers and

194
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:30,684
catalogues. Looks like she's been doing a fair
amount of work here at the desk and stands up in a

195
00:14:30,684 --> 00:14:35,740
very formal way and begins to step towards you.
"When have you arrived?"

196
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,774
SAM: Just today. Father kidnapped me and brought
me home.

197
00:14:39,774 --> 00:14:45,031
MATT: "Kidnapped?"

198
00:14:45,031 --> 00:14:52,542
SAM: Well, I'm not a kid, but still works.
Abducted. Abducted me and brought me home. Paid

199
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:54,183
someone to do it.

200
00:14:54,183 --> 00:14:55,258
MATT: "Right."

201
00:14:55,258 --> 00:15:05,448
SAM: Yes. Anyway, it's good to see you. Your room
is coming along quite nicely. It seems like you're

202
00:15:05,448 --> 00:15:07,551
running the show now, is that true?

203
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:14,037
MATT: "No, not quite, but the responsibilities
have definitely been mounting. You look well. How

204
00:15:14,037 --> 00:15:18,885
"have the wind-tossed roads of Exandria
treated you this past year?"

205
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:26,002
SAM: Well, I have had many adventures and close
calls, but I won't bore you with those details.

206
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:33,686
It's been an interesting year abroad, and I would
say I'm glad to be back, but for the abduction

207
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:40,889
part and also the fact that I've now learned 
that we are destitute? Is that true?

208
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:45,133
MATT: "We're on the path to destitution, yes."

209
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:49,191
SAM: So it's true; he wasn't just trying to guilt
me.

210
00:15:49,191 --> 00:16:00,128
MATT: "Probably both, to be honest. We're in a
relatively dire situation compared to our previous

211
00:16:00,128 --> 00:16:08,699
"long-standing lifestyle choices. We're trying to
fix this mess."

212
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:13,397
SAM: And what would have been your plan had I not
arrived today?

213
00:16:13,397 --> 00:16:21,126
MATT: "Well, you were part of the plan. We're
trying to figure this out the best we can and

214
00:16:21,126 --> 00:16:36,665
"given the circumstances, we feel this is probably
one of the most viable and least dangerous or risky

215
00:16:36,665 --> 00:16:40,589
"endeavors in which we can right the family's
trajectory."

216
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:44,548
SAM: By marrying me to some lady I've never met?

217
00:16:44,548 --> 00:16:48,560
MATT: "Oh, you're welcome to meet her. I've met
her. I helped to arrange this."

218
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,623
SAM: What is she like?

219
00:16:50,623 --> 00:16:56,474
MATT: "She's very nice. She's very pretty, a bit
bookish, which once again would befit you rather

220
00:16:56,474 --> 00:17:05,860
"well, but let's be honest. This is a
political marriage. You do what you want. I mean,

221
00:17:06,053 --> 00:17:12,540
"there isn't a politician or a lord of this land
that hasn't in some way, shape, or form made their

222
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:18,980
"own life outside of the family." At that point,
you noticed she gets a bit dark and seems to speak

223
00:17:19,027 --> 00:17:21,241
with this bit of sarcasm.

224
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:31,423
SAM: And father's businesses, are they being run
the same way? With the same attention to detail?

225
00:17:31,423 --> 00:17:43,944
MATT: "There's been no necessary change to the way
business has been done. Other than the transition

226
00:17:43,944 --> 00:17:49,313
"of some responsibilities, of course." And she
gives a slight nod. She's getting a little

227
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:52,354
uncomfortable as this conversation continues.

228
00:17:52,354 --> 00:18:03,344
SAM: Listen, I'm sorry to pop in like this and
challenge your judgment, but me marrying this

229
00:18:03,344 --> 00:18:09,221
person would solve our problems long-term?
Somehow?

230
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:21,566
MATT: "Marrying into this family, the Truscan lot,
would enable us the resources and connections to

231
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:30,908
"reacquire the deeds to our land, to reacquire the
business elements that we've been in this

232
00:18:30,908 --> 00:18:37,046
"unnecessary partnership with for some time, and
would enable us to once again reclaim complete

233
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:42,443
"rulership of our family-controlled lands."

234
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:44,893
SAM: Do we not own anything anymore?

235
00:18:44,893 --> 00:18:51,876
MATT: "It is a partnership that is quickly
sliding into the behest of the Myriad."

236
00:18:51,941 --> 00:18:57,410
SAM: So what is ours now? Anything? Our personal
belongings? This home?

237
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:06,788
MATT: "We still own everything, in partnership.
Own solely on our own? Some of the furniture."

238
00:19:06,788 --> 00:19:20,681
SAM: And again, if I do this, what's to say we're
not just going to drive up another debt again?

239
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:30,609
Doesn't seem like father or you have been very
good at keeping us in the black.

240
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:36,309
MATT: "I have only been recently brought into this
unfortunate circumstance, brother. And you can

241
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:41,596
"trust in knowing that in my studies and my time
spent here, working with father, being very clear,

242
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:44,443
"and very thorough with the mistakes he's made
in the past,

243
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,678
"I will not be doomed to repeat them."

244
00:19:46,678 --> 00:19:53,614
SAM: So you and he are two peas in a pod, yes?

245
00:19:53,614 --> 00:20:01,857
MATT: "Well, he's certainly in need of retiring
based on the stress he's put upon himself. It would

246
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:07,100
"not be long until I will take over the
responsibilities."

247
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:17,132
SAM: Well, I may poke around and see if there's
another way I could help. But before I do, is this

248
00:20:17,187 --> 00:20:23,220
fun for you? Do you like running this business, or
almost running it?

249
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:28,394
MATT: "It's certainly a better challenge than many
other daughters of lords

250
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,334
"are given in their time."

251
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:32,985
SAM: Do you have any friends?

252
00:20:32,985 --> 00:20:43,187
MATT: "Friends come, when the money and power's
in place. You know this."

253
00:20:43,227 --> 00:20:44,986
SAM: I do.

254
00:20:44,986 --> 00:20:49,151
MATT: "It's the way the land works."

255
00:20:49,151 --> 00:21:01,171
SAM: Well, I'll leave you to your work, and-- love
the decorations. I'm considering the offer and

256
00:21:01,171 --> 00:21:06,171
I'll have an answer for you by tomorrow morning.

257
00:21:06,171 --> 00:21:12,857
MATT: "Wonderful." As you begin to make any sort
of exit, she catches you and goes, "Brother,

258
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:22,618
"your arrival here is a great boon to us. You have
the power to change the fate of this family.

259
00:21:22,618 --> 00:21:30,030
"Consider the respect you have for the people who
have worked their entire lives to provide for you

260
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:40,302
"what you have been given. Mother and Father 
sacrificed so much for us. Consider weighing one's

261
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:45,802
"selfish interest versus the importance of a
bloodline. That is all I ask."

262
00:21:45,802 --> 00:21:51,379
SAM: All right. I'll consider it. With all my
intellect.

263
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:57,343
MATT: "Well, it's good to see you." She steps
forward and gives you a half-hug.

264
00:21:57,398 --> 00:21:59,307
It's like--

265
00:21:59,307 --> 00:22:07,983
SAM: A pat. The back pat. Good day.

266
00:22:07,997 --> 00:22:13,800
MATT: "Good day." She straightens her coat and 
sits back behind her desk

267
00:22:13,803 --> 00:22:16,002
and waits for you to leave.

268
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:26,803
SAM: All right. I'll shimmy out. (sighs) All
right, I'll rejoin my friends downstairs. Well--

269
00:22:26,866 --> 00:22:28,229
LAURA: How did it go?

270
00:22:28,229 --> 00:22:29,704
LIAM: Well, yourself.

271
00:22:29,704 --> 00:22:38,696
SAM: As expected. Things are about the same
between me and Maryanne.

272
00:22:38,696 --> 00:22:40,430
LAURA: Is she still a raging bitch?

273
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,481
SAM: No, she's not raging.

274
00:22:42,481 --> 00:22:45,884
ASHLEY: I just think it's rather rude that she
doesn't want to come down here and meet us.

275
00:22:45,884 --> 00:22:47,531
SAM: She has her work and her--

276
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:49,236
LIAM: Oh, she's not coming down?

277
00:22:49,236 --> 00:22:50,530
SAM: No.

278
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,985
LIAM: That's weird.

279
00:22:51,985 --> 00:22:57,499
SAM: I mean, I don't know, she's busy. I guess.

280
00:22:57,499 --> 00:22:58,883
LIAM: Okay.

281
00:22:58,883 --> 00:23:04,324
SAM: They're not guest people. They're not dinner
party family.

282
00:23:04,324 --> 00:23:05,748
LIAM: We picked up on that.

283
00:23:05,748 --> 00:23:13,094
LAURA: Not even for people who could help them with
their name?

284
00:23:13,148 --> 00:23:20,366
MARISHA: Did you mention us or anything else?

285
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:22,795
SAM: Nope. It didn't come up.

286
00:23:22,795 --> 00:23:27,019
LIAM: Did they have any idea what a heavy hitter
you are now? The type of people you roll with?

287
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:31,363
SAM: They said, how have I been? But they don't
really give a shit either way.

288
00:23:31,363 --> 00:23:34,522
MARISHA: So you didn't even offer up the
information?

289
00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:39,631
SAM: If they are not interested in me, why should
I be interested in them knowing about me?

290
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:41,263
LAURA: That's a very good point.

291
00:23:41,263 --> 00:23:47,867
LIAM: Let's back it up. What are you thinking?
Where's your head at? How can we help you?

292
00:23:47,867 --> 00:23:58,759
SAM: I don't know what to do. There's this woman;
she's apparently nice and I could go for it and

293
00:23:58,766 --> 00:24:03,810
marry her, and then it seems like all my family
problems would be okay.

294
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,147
ASHLEY: Forever?

295
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:10,215
MARISHA: There's no such thing as family problems
being okay for forever.

296
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:11,959
TRAVIS: Really?

297
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:20,156
SAM: I don't know. I'm sort of curious about talking
to the people who are in this contract with my

298
00:24:20,214 --> 00:24:28,610
father and seeing if there's any way to wiggle out
of it a little bit, but I don't know how to solve

299
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:39,115
everything right now. I also don't know-- I feel a
duty, a responsibility to this family, because

300
00:24:39,115 --> 00:24:40,622
they are my family.

301
00:24:40,622 --> 00:24:42,334
MARISHA: Grog!

302
00:24:42,334 --> 00:24:51,053
TRAVIS: You feel a doodie? The privy is over there!
Or over there! Or the front yard beckons.

303
00:24:51,204 --> 00:24:53,877
TALIESIN: He may have opened a bottle of wine.

304
00:24:53,918 --> 00:24:56,463
TRAVIS: I'm lost for the rest of this
conversation.

305
00:24:56,522 --> 00:25:01,532
LAURA: No, we're not drunk, we may have just had a 
little bit of wine, just a small amount.

306
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,216
TRAVIS: I carved my name into the floor.

307
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:14,583
SAM: Part of me wants to-- oh god. Part of me
wants to turn around and go back with you to

308
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:20,384
Whitestone and forget that the Darringtons exist,
but I don't think I can't do that. I am a

309
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:29,736
Darrington and I owe it at least to my name to
try and fix what I can.

310
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:31,034
LAURA: That's your plan?

311
00:25:31,034 --> 00:25:31,892
SAM: Yes.

312
00:25:31,892 --> 00:25:34,206
LAURA: Don't sacrifice your entire life
for this, though.

313
00:25:34,247 --> 00:25:38,335
SAM: Well, I'll try not to, but it seems like a
plan B at this point.

314
00:25:38,335 --> 00:25:45,111
LIAM: Also, you had no prior knowledge to your
family's connection to the mob?

315
00:25:45,154 --> 00:25:54,146
SAM: No? It's way cooler than I thought my family
ever was. I knew my dad did shady business with

316
00:25:54,146 --> 00:26:01,845
lots of shady characters but I never knew-- I
assumed he paid off people. I assumed he had

317
00:26:01,845 --> 00:26:09,957
friends in high places and people who you'd have
to bribe to turn the other cheek, but I never knew

318
00:26:09,957 --> 00:26:24,225
that he was in business with them, owing our whole
existence to these terrible people, and I don't

319
00:26:24,225 --> 00:26:26,465
know what to make of that

320
00:26:26,465 --> 00:26:34,994
LIAM: T, I think we're all prepared to help you do
anything you want to do, but are you sure you want

321
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:39,515
to help perpetuate the family business?

322
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:45,113
SAM: Definitely not. Listen, I think there's two
steps to this: there's the short term and the long

323
00:26:45,113 --> 00:26:53,451
term. We have to solve this short-term need really
quickly. Not this whole 230,000-dollar-- I mean

324
00:26:53,451 --> 00:27:06,631
-gold debt. It's a Whitestone term, I mean a
Wildmount. Oh my god. My phone rang! I'm confused!

325
00:27:06,689 --> 00:27:18,695
Anyway, listen, couple drinks before-- no. We
have a short-term problem that we can maybe go

326
00:27:18,695 --> 00:27:24,906
alleviate a bit if we go talk to these folk at the
Laughing Ninny or whatever it's called.

327
00:27:24,906 --> 00:27:26,865
The Grumpy Lily.

328
00:27:26,865 --> 00:27:33,295
LIAM: I like the Laughing Ninny. I kinda want to go
there instead.

329
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:35,828
TALIESIN: It's a stand-up comedy club.

330
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:40,760
(laughter)

331
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:46,784
SAM: And then there's a long-term problem which
I'll have to solve on another day. There's a long-

332
00:27:46,784 --> 00:27:52,198
term problem that my family is awful and needs to
be stopped at all costs, and that's something that

333
00:27:52,242 --> 00:27:54,427
I'll have to deal with tomorrow.

334
00:27:54,427 --> 00:28:01,174
LAURA: Do the Truscans, that's who you are being
married into potentially, do they have a son?

335
00:28:01,174 --> 00:28:06,294
TALIESIN: That doesn't help! That's almost beside
the point!

336
00:28:06,294 --> 00:28:09,484
SAM: You're talking about marrying the sister?
Yeah.

337
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:11,233
TALIESIN: Oh, that's still--

338
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:13,315
LAURA: I guess it's not the same, is it?

339
00:28:13,512 --> 00:28:17,148
TALIESIN: No! Actually, it's unfortunately
the opposite.

340
00:28:17,191 --> 00:28:19,795
SAM: You're royalty. You know this!

341
00:28:19,795 --> 00:28:22,194
LAURA: Of course, I know everything about
royalty.

342
00:28:22,194 --> 00:28:23,870
SAM: Little royal girl.

343
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:34,996
MARISHA: What exactly is your duty that you are
feeling inclined towards? Damn it, Grog!

344
00:28:34,996 --> 00:28:36,518
TALIESIN: Lilah? Is it Lilah?

345
00:28:36,518 --> 00:28:37,602
ALL: Lydia.

346
00:28:37,602 --> 00:28:42,611
TALIESIN: Perhaps we should talk to this Lydia as
well, because she is obviously in a position of

347
00:28:42,665 --> 00:28:44,776
being told what she is going to do with herself.

348
00:28:44,776 --> 00:28:46,890
MARISHA: Yeah! Maybe she's also a badass!

349
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,250
LIAM: At the very least, we should meet all the chess
pieces on the board, right?

350
00:28:50,292 --> 00:28:55,544
SAM: I mean, she lives in another part of the
kingdom, right, Matthew Mercer?

351
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:58,249
MARISHA: That's not a problem.

352
00:28:58,249 --> 00:29:04,514
SAM: Oh yes, that's true. But there's the in-town
people we can meet first.

353
00:29:04,514 --> 00:29:07,494
LAURA: Sure. Let's talk to the mob!

354
00:29:07,494 --> 00:29:12,735
SAM: Yes, of course! You'll come with me? Because
I can't talk to the mob by myself.

355
00:29:12,735 --> 00:29:14,037
LAURA: Tary, of course we will!

356
00:29:14,037 --> 00:29:16,144
TRAVIS: Wait, when you said we need to stop your
family at all costs,

357
00:29:16,144 --> 00:29:17,560
are you talking about killing them?

358
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,418
SAM: No, I'm not talking about killing them.

359
00:29:19,418 --> 00:29:24,198
MARISHA: Yeah, but Grog does bring up a point that
I was trying to make before he started laughing

360
00:29:24,198 --> 00:29:37,894
when I said "duty." (giggles) But what, are you
committed to keeping your family around? You said

361
00:29:37,894 --> 00:29:43,263
you were compelled and you felt like you had a duty
but then you immediately started talking about--

362
00:29:43,263 --> 00:29:46,209
TALIESIN: Stop it, Travis! God, I can't--

363
00:29:46,265 --> 00:29:50,948
MARISHA: Tearing your family apart? And stopping
them?

364
00:29:50,948 --> 00:30:02,697
SAM: My family is pretty bad, I've learned. But
I've also learned from young Trickfoot that even a

365
00:30:02,697 --> 00:30:14,730
rotten family is worth trying to save. And I
admire the path that she took with her family, and

366
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:26,374
I would like to at least try to push mine in the
right direction and try to make our name a little

367
00:30:26,374 --> 00:30:30,019
less shitty.

368
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:32,483
LIAM: That is a pretty big matzo ball, my friend.

369
00:30:32,483 --> 00:30:37,852
SAM: Well, that's why that's long term. In the
short term, I just want to get them safe.

370
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:46,394
MARISHA: If there's one thing I understand, it's
giving your life to a cause.

371
00:30:46,394 --> 00:30:50,202
SAM: I don't want to die, if that's what you're
saying.

372
00:30:50,202 --> 00:30:52,835
MARISHA: No.

373
00:30:52,835 --> 00:30:54,285
SAM: Dedicating.

374
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:55,204
MARISHA: Dedicating.

375
00:30:55,204 --> 00:30:56,573
SAM: Thank you.

376
00:30:56,573 --> 00:30:59,017
MARISHA: Time is a gift, I would say.

377
00:30:59,017 --> 00:31:00,050
SAM: Sure.

378
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:06,206
MARISHA: So dedicating that gift is, it's a big
thing, but I hope you believe in it.

379
00:31:06,206 --> 00:31:12,263
SAM: I don't believe in them, but I believe in the
cause right now,

380
00:31:12,263 --> 00:31:15,083
and we'll see how far that takes us.

381
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16,848
MARISHA: We believe in you.

382
00:31:16,848 --> 00:31:20,113
SAM: You guys.

383
00:31:20,113 --> 00:31:23,660
TRAVIS: Can you describe to me this duty?

384
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,718
MARISHA: You don't care!

385
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:31,754
TRAVIS: I think I do now. Is it real hard?

386
00:31:31,754 --> 00:31:37,986
SAM: It's a little more nebulous than that, Grog.

387
00:31:37,986 --> 00:31:40,576
TALIESIN: We can pass on this for now.

388
00:31:40,576 --> 00:31:43,574
TRAVIS: Adjectives are not my strong suit, so.

389
00:31:43,574 --> 00:31:46,946
LAURA: You know what an adjective is! That's
impressive.

390
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:51,295
TRAVIS: Yeah. No, I got it one time at this
tavern. I had it for two nights.

391
00:31:51,295 --> 00:31:53,847
It just itched everywhere.

392
00:31:53,847 --> 00:31:56,864
SAM: Listen. When you see my duty, you'll know.

393
00:31:56,864 --> 00:32:00,001
TRAVIS: Copy that.

394
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:03,725
LIAM: It's loose. This duty is loose.

395
00:32:03,725 --> 00:32:06,204
LAURA: Should we go to the Grumpy Lily, then?

396
00:32:06,204 --> 00:32:07,410
TALIESIN: Please.

397
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,887
LAURA: This is going so well.

398
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:15,279
MATT: As you're exiting the house and Berthold's
opening the door, you hear some heavy creaking

399
00:32:15,336 --> 00:32:25,699
from the stair that leads down to the main area,
and you watch as an older woman in her early

400
00:32:25,699 --> 00:32:32,462
fifties or so with her mid-length, curly brown
hair in shades of gray, green eyes behind a small

401
00:32:32,462 --> 00:32:40,742
set of reading spectacles, stoic of face, wearing
what looks to be some sort of a finely crafted

402
00:32:40,742 --> 00:32:49,497
silk robe, clutching a book under her arm, comes
down the steps and looks down and goes, "Taryon?"

403
00:32:49,497 --> 00:32:51,630
SAM: Mama?

404
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:56,492
MATT: "Taryon, my boy!" And she sets the book down
and walks up, puts her hands out as she says,

405
00:32:56,492 --> 00:33:05,965
"Oh," takes you at the sides of the face and pulls
you in for (kisses). "Oh, terribly sorry. I

406
00:33:05,965 --> 00:33:07,734
"didn't realize that we had guests."

407
00:33:07,734 --> 00:33:15,591
SAM: Oh, yes, these are my allies and my friends.
This is the team known as Vox Machina. They are a

408
00:33:15,591 --> 00:33:19,885
fearless band of adventurers and they have taken
me in as their own.

409
00:33:19,885 --> 00:33:22,248
MATT: "Look at you, so rugged!"

410
00:33:22,248 --> 00:33:25,795
SAM: Well. Yes, I am, a bit!

411
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,941
MATT: "So you've had some adventures with my boy,
have you?

412
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:30,727
ALL: We have.

413
00:33:30,727 --> 00:33:36,210
MATT: "That's wonderful. Have you spoken with your
father?"

414
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:46,900
SAM: Yes, I've spoken to Father, and Sister, and
it's good to know they're healthy. And it's lovely

415
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:52,026
to see you, as well. Have you been happy at all,
this last year?

416
00:33:52,026 --> 00:34:01,701
MATT: "I--" And she reaches back and takes the
book off the step and goes, "I've been making my

417
00:34:01,701 --> 00:34:04,140
"way through your library."

418
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,263
SAM: Oh! Oh, my books, in my room.

419
00:34:07,263 --> 00:34:13,667
MATT: "Yes! Well, I've had a lot of time to
myself. Been a bit under the weather for some

420
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:17,123
"time, and these have kept me fine company."

421
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:26,844
SAM: Oh. That's lovely. I hope you've enjoyed them
as much as I did. What's your favorite one?

422
00:34:26,844 --> 00:34:40,018
MATT: "Well, not this piece of trash." And she
sets it down. "There's one. What was it called?

423
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:45,817
"The River's Dawn. It was a brilliant--"

424
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,745
SAM: Before the River's Dawn, yes.

425
00:34:47,745 --> 00:35:00,165
MATT: "Before the River's Dawn! That one, yes. It
was a continuation of the creation myth of

426
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:06,703
"Wildmount, but it turned into the spirits of the
gods, these two fauns, and they fell in love but

427
00:35:06,703 --> 00:35:10,807
"could not be together because the dawn had to rise
and the sun would shine.

428
00:35:10,807 --> 00:35:12,931
"It was very, very beautiful!"

429
00:35:12,931 --> 00:35:15,547
SAM: Yes, yes! No it was, but also heartbreaking
at the same time.

430
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:17,881
MATT: "Very much so. It reminded me of you."

431
00:35:17,881 --> 00:35:22,859
SAM: Yes. That's one of my favorites, as well.

432
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:27,801
MATT: "Well. I didn't break the binding too much,
I hope."

433
00:35:27,801 --> 00:35:30,401
SAM: I'll fix it if you did. It's all right.

434
00:35:30,401 --> 00:35:31,556
MATT: "All right."

435
00:35:31,556 --> 00:35:40,637
SAM: Well, that's wonderful to hear. I'm glad
you've been entertaining yourself. I know living

436
00:35:40,637 --> 00:35:45,842
with Papa can be very hard, and it's been very
hard on you all these years.

437
00:35:45,842 --> 00:35:58,932
MATT: "If you would excuse us for just a moment,
please. Just a few moments." And she points

438
00:35:58,932 --> 00:36:00,345
towards the door.

439
00:36:00,345 --> 00:36:01,567
SAM: I told you they were like this.

440
00:36:01,567 --> 00:36:03,970
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, we're going out the front door.
Front yard.

441
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,346
MARISHA: Bottle of wine!

442
00:36:06,346 --> 00:36:10,307
MATT: Berthold is leading you out of the main area,
out the front door.

443
00:36:10,307 --> 00:36:11,528
TRAVIS: Yeah, front door!

444
00:36:11,528 --> 00:36:13,525
LAURA: Out the house, like get out?

445
00:36:13,525 --> 00:36:15,014
MATT: You guys were on your way out.

446
00:36:15,014 --> 00:36:16,486
SAM: Just wait on the fucking porch!

447
00:36:16,486 --> 00:36:19,166
LIAM: We got it.

448
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:21,223
LAURA: Fine.

449
00:36:21,223 --> 00:36:31,931
MATT: As soon as she has some privacy with you,
she goes, "My boy, if you could indulge me in some

450
00:36:31,931 --> 00:36:45,713
"strange honesty, I'm rather intrigued at this
idea. I don't wish to undermine anything that

451
00:36:45,713 --> 00:36:54,427
"we've built as a family. I've lived a privileged
life for a very long time, far longer than you and

452
00:36:54,427 --> 00:37:07,258
"your sister have. I've lived within this house,
removed from the world. I do as responsibility

453
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:19,952
"asks of me, my wedded duties as both a wife and a
mother, and I do so without complaint. I have

454
00:37:20,002 --> 00:37:26,806
"always seen you fight these same circumstances
bravely, and I find vicarious joy in your escape

455
00:37:26,806 --> 00:37:43,440
"from this place this past year. These books are a
reminder of that same bravery. I know Howaardt has

456
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:59,140
"said many things, and he may be right. But there's
a little part of me that welcomes a little change

457
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:09,729
"in scenery and lifestyle. Maybe that's what the
family needs. I don't know. Perhaps I'm foolhardy.

458
00:38:09,729 --> 00:38:10,720
"I know not."

459
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:21,822
SAM: No, you're right to think this way. This year
has been eye-opening for me, and I know that you

460
00:38:21,822 --> 00:38:31,563
care for Papa, and you are a diligent and faithful
wife. But I know how hard it must have been to

461
00:38:31,563 --> 00:38:40,718
live this life for so many years and I wonder what
it would be like if you hadn't been with him, what

462
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:43,802
kind of person you would be.

463
00:38:43,802 --> 00:38:49,002
MATT: "Looking at you, looking at your sister, I
wouldn't change it for the world."

464
00:38:49,002 --> 00:38:59,385
SAM: Well, things are going to have to change at
some point, right?

465
00:38:59,385 --> 00:39:14,811
MATT: "One way or another. I just-- (sighs) I just
want you to make choices for yourself. I want you

466
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:30,115
"to do what you think is right, that you could live
with. Duty and blood is one thing, but... Anyway,

467
00:39:30,115 --> 00:39:32,527
"I'm talking out of turn."

468
00:39:32,527 --> 00:39:36,754
SAM: No. Thank you. Thank you for that.

469
00:39:36,754 --> 00:39:42,915
MATT: "Could you not tell Howaardt we've had this
conversation?"

470
00:39:42,915 --> 00:39:56,454
SAM: Mum's the word. All right. I'll be back, and
maybe we'll have time to talk more books later.

471
00:39:56,454 --> 00:39:58,251
MATT: "I would like that very much."

472
00:39:58,251 --> 00:40:00,702
SAM: Good evening.

473
00:40:00,702 --> 00:40:08,750
MATT: "Good evening." As you leave, she's like,
"Oh! The other one I was trying to remember was

474
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:13,827
"The Mountain Range of Gold. It was a wonderful
three-part series--"

475
00:40:13,827 --> 00:40:16,852
SAM: When you think he's dead, but he's not, and
he comes back?

476
00:40:16,852 --> 00:40:19,703
MATT: "Well, the second book, you get halfway
through it before he even turns

477
00:40:19,703 --> 00:40:20,721
"and reveals himself!"

478
00:40:20,721 --> 00:40:24,595
SAM: I know! Well, you never see the body in the
first one, so that should have been a tip-off.

479
00:40:24,595 --> 00:40:29,572
MATT: "And then the white robes and everything!
His renewed power, it's incredible! Anyway, I'm

480
00:40:29,572 --> 00:40:34,533
"sorry, you have your friends waiting on you. Good
night, Taryon."

481
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:36,096
SAM: Yes.

482
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,903
LIAM: I want to adopt her.

483
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:39,508
MARISHA: She's awesome!

484
00:40:39,508 --> 00:40:44,152
MATT: So as you step out to greet the rest of your
friends?

485
00:40:44,152 --> 00:40:49,848
SAM: All right, let's go to the Jumping Jimmy, or
whatever it's called.

486
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:51,290
LAURA: How's your mother?

487
00:40:51,290 --> 00:41:04,215
SAM: She's better. I mean, she's had a tough time.
That was the longest conversation I've had with

488
00:41:04,215 --> 00:41:06,562
her in many years.

489
00:41:06,562 --> 00:41:08,404
LAURA: Wow.

490
00:41:08,404 --> 00:41:12,030
ASHLEY: She said she's under the weather. What's
wrong?

491
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:18,289
SAM: I think everybody's super stressed out and
heartsick about everything that's happening, and

492
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:30,372
living under a tyrant of a father is not healthy.
You should have seen me when I lived here. I was

493
00:41:30,372 --> 00:41:37,703
not nearly as dashing or as charming as I am now.
It took me spreading my wings and flying before I

494
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:44,855
found my sense of humor. My hair looks better, my
eyes look better.

495
00:41:44,855 --> 00:41:47,834
MARISHA: I thought you said that was because of
the aloe vera.

496
00:41:47,834 --> 00:41:50,116
SAM: Well, yes. We didn't have any at home.

497
00:41:50,116 --> 00:41:56,254
MARISHA: Right, yeah. Salt air is better for you.

498
00:41:56,254 --> 00:42:04,428
SAM: I mean, life needs aloe to live. Is something
I always say.

499
00:42:04,428 --> 00:42:09,163
TALIESIN: That's true.

500
00:42:09,163 --> 00:42:12,113
LIAM: I've heard you say that two or three times.

501
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:17,336
SAM: Moisturizing products in general. Life needs
moisturizing products to live.

502
00:42:17,336 --> 00:42:20,002
TALIESIN: Life needs moisture to live.

503
00:42:20,002 --> 00:42:23,804
ASHLEY: I know my beauty regimen's changed.

504
00:42:23,804 --> 00:42:27,492
MARISHA: Life needs moisture to live. It's way
smarter-sounding.

505
00:42:27,492 --> 00:42:31,642
TALIESIN: All right, gauntlet dropped.

506
00:42:31,642 --> 00:42:36,502
LAURA: All right, to the Laughing Ninny it is.

507
00:42:36,502 --> 00:42:41,177
MATT: All right. Who's leading this charge?
Probably you, Taryon.

508
00:42:41,177 --> 00:42:42,972
SAM: I know the place.

509
00:42:42,972 --> 00:42:44,765
LIAM: You are in charge while we're here.

510
00:42:44,765 --> 00:42:48,025
MATT: You've never been to this place. You've
heard of it, but you'd never be seen dead in a

511
00:42:48,025 --> 00:42:54,806
place like this before. You lead your way in. At
this point, because when you arrived the sun was

512
00:42:54,806 --> 00:43:02,397
still in the sky, but it was deep in the sky, so
by now it's post-dusk. You now see the massive

513
00:43:02,397 --> 00:43:10,475
stone and wood structures of Deastok are dark
against the ever-dark sky with the windows now

514
00:43:10,475 --> 00:43:18,327
aglow, this warm yellows and orange of the candle
and lantern-lit interiors. You can see there are

515
00:43:18,327 --> 00:43:21,671
hanging lanterns that are put out there, and you
can see a number of individuals who seem to work

516
00:43:21,671 --> 00:43:27,281
for the city, who go and place these lanterns up in
each of these poles, are now finishing their job

517
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:33,504
and are returning to the evening. Following these
lamps, along the street, the cobblestones are

518
00:43:33,504 --> 00:43:41,049
still really well kept for as old as this town
seems to be. For a city that isn't a major

519
00:43:41,049 --> 00:43:48,707
metropolis within a kingdom, and what your
experience has been in Tal'Dorei, a fair amount of

520
00:43:48,707 --> 00:43:56,468
money still makes it way through this city.
Eventually, you find your way fairly far north

521
00:43:56,468 --> 00:44:02,106
into the city until you come across the exterior
of the Grumpy Lily. Asking a few questions to

522
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:07,725
guide you to which building it is, it's much smaller
than you expected. You see what appears to be a

523
00:44:07,725 --> 00:44:18,413
single-story pub with one window, one door, no
more than maybe 30 feet on any given side. It is

524
00:44:18,413 --> 00:44:26,874
lit from the inside, though it's dimly lit. As you
approach and push past the somewhat ajar entryway,

525
00:44:26,874 --> 00:44:36,383
you see before you what appears to be three
tables. Three singular, stained, brown tables. One

526
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:41,876
lone patron sits at the center table, an elderly
man inspecting a small, clay sculpture that he's

527
00:44:41,876 --> 00:44:48,619
enraptured by, and a single barkeep to your right
that seems to notice your entry. A healthy, pale

528
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:54,127
woman of brunette hair in her forties, dressed in
a simple gray blouse. As soon as you enter and

529
00:44:54,127 --> 00:45:00,760
take in the atmosphere, she goes, "Slow day,
folks! Happy to have the business!

530
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,854
"What can I get you?"

531
00:45:02,854 --> 00:45:05,559
LIAM: Jeez, Grog, I don't even know if you're
going to fit in here.

532
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:07,862
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's really tiny.

533
00:45:07,862 --> 00:45:10,593
MATT: Your head does reach the ceiling.

534
00:45:10,593 --> 00:45:11,696
TRAVIS: Shit.

535
00:45:11,696 --> 00:45:13,795
LAURA: Just dive in then?

536
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:16,801
SAM: Should we get anything to drink first? Or
just dive in?

537
00:45:16,801 --> 00:45:19,446
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's like how you have to buy
something to use the restroom.

538
00:45:19,446 --> 00:45:28,777
MARISHA: Do you have a shiraz? I was just
wondering if you had any imports. Do you have a

539
00:45:28,777 --> 00:45:29,746
red wine?

540
00:45:29,746 --> 00:45:35,728
MATT: "Yes! That I can get for you, dear. Don't
worry. Red wine we can do definitely." She walks

541
00:45:35,728 --> 00:45:41,340
over and slams her hand on the side of the bar and
what you thought was once the patron now appears

542
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:47,153
to be the one barman there. "Wait! What! Oh. I
missed the conversation."

543
00:45:47,153 --> 00:45:49,096
TRAVIS: Oh the guy with the sculpture?

544
00:45:49,096 --> 00:45:52,587
MATT: Yeah. "Red wine, for our guests."

545
00:45:52,587 --> 00:45:58,590
"Oh." He stands up and begrudgingly walks over.
You see his back is hunched forward and he's

546
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,828
(pained grunting). Leaves the room for a second.

547
00:46:01,828 --> 00:46:04,321
"Well, sit down, find a place wherever you like."

548
00:46:04,321 --> 00:46:09,093
SAM: Put two tables together, I guess?

549
00:46:09,093 --> 00:46:10,686
LAURA: All three, really.

550
00:46:10,686 --> 00:46:12,512
MARISHA: Let's just take them all.

551
00:46:12,512 --> 00:46:17,124
TRAVIS: Wait, this is the meeting place of a dark
group, right? A shady group? Shouldn't we check

552
00:46:17,124 --> 00:46:19,311
this area for anything shady?

553
00:46:19,311 --> 00:46:25,097
TALIESIN: Is there shade in this establishment?

554
00:46:25,097 --> 00:46:27,611
MATT: It's dimly lit, so there's plenty of
shadows.

555
00:46:27,611 --> 00:46:36,094
LIAM: It's a five-by-five square. Do we see
anything amiss? Oh, that's terrible. 24.

556
00:46:36,094 --> 00:46:43,548
MATT: Nothing seems amiss. It seems like a shitty
pub. It's the definition of a

557
00:46:43,548 --> 00:46:45,581
poorly attended dive.

558
00:46:45,581 --> 00:46:51,774
LAURA: Does it look like there's any seams in the
ground that would be a trapdoor or anything?

559
00:46:51,834 --> 00:46:55,704
MATT: You can make an investigation check if you
want to.

560
00:46:55,704 --> 00:46:58,762
LAURA: 17.

561
00:46:58,762 --> 00:47:05,238
MATT: You begin to look around the floor and keep
perspective around the area. No. You see some

562
00:47:05,238 --> 00:47:09,753
stains, you see some crumbs, and at one point you
look over in the corner and you see what appears

563
00:47:09,753 --> 00:47:13,122
to be a piece of stale bread that's been left
under one of the tables and there are three rats

564
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:16,694
currently eating it. As soon as you lean in, they
all stop and look at you and scatter.

565
00:47:16,694 --> 00:47:18,411
LAURA: Oh, you can keep going.

566
00:47:18,411 --> 00:47:21,970
TALIESIN: Could be worse. They could not be afraid
of you.

567
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:23,130
LAURA: That's true.

568
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:26,027
MATT: (laughs) They just give you the fuck-you
look and keep eating their bread.

569
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:31,365
TALIESIN: That's when you know you've really found
the right bar. The rats were like: "We reserved

570
00:47:31,365 --> 00:47:36,020
"this table two weeks ago. You have to make a phone
call."

571
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:41,152
MATT: The elderly barman walks in now and he's got
two bottles of red wine and he's shuffling.

572
00:47:41,152 --> 00:47:49,990
(grunts, clinks) "I'll get your cups." Turns
around and starts shuffling back.

573
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:52,866
LAURA: (laughing) Do you need any help?

574
00:47:52,866 --> 00:47:55,811
MARISHA: I mean we have-- Oh, it's fine.

575
00:47:55,811 --> 00:47:57,695
TALIESIN: Just let it happen.

576
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:01,875
SAM: Okay. Who do you think we proposition here?
The old man?

577
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:02,845
LIAM: That guy.

578
00:48:02,845 --> 00:48:05,576
SAM: That guy? Really? What makes you say that?

579
00:48:05,576 --> 00:48:07,326
TALIESIN: Shifty eyes.

580
00:48:07,326 --> 00:48:09,401
LIAM: Shifty yeah, may be an act, even.

581
00:48:09,401 --> 00:48:11,649
SAM: He's just old I thought. No?

582
00:48:11,649 --> 00:48:13,169
LAURA: Nobody's just old.

583
00:48:13,169 --> 00:48:15,019
LIAM: He's many things.

584
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:16,950
MARISHA: That's true, look at Pike's grandpa.

585
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:18,466
LIAM: Look at Pike.

586
00:48:18,466 --> 00:48:20,321
ASHLEY: Look at me.

587
00:48:20,321 --> 00:48:25,302
LIAM: How old are you, again?

588
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:27,841
ASHLEY: 142.

589
00:48:27,841 --> 00:48:29,144
LIAM: I said goddamn.

590
00:48:29,144 --> 00:48:30,525
SAM: Is that true?

591
00:48:30,525 --> 00:48:31,663
ASHLEY: No.

592
00:48:31,663 --> 00:48:32,523
SAM: Oh.

593
00:48:32,523 --> 00:48:36,574
(laughter)

594
00:48:36,574 --> 00:48:41,388
SAM: Oh. Well, because you could be.

595
00:48:41,388 --> 00:48:44,624
ASHLEY: I forgot my birthday. I don't know how old
I am.

596
00:48:44,624 --> 00:48:46,358
SAM: Is it in the hundreds?

597
00:48:46,358 --> 00:48:50,672
ASHLEY: No. I think it's in the 30s.

598
00:48:50,672 --> 00:48:53,356
SAM: Oh, okay.

599
00:48:53,356 --> 00:48:54,849
ASHLEY: Right?

600
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:56,480
MATT: Whatever you want.

601
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,151
ASHLEY: Yeah.

602
00:48:58,151 --> 00:48:59,782
LIAM: You ain't no baby.

603
00:48:59,782 --> 00:49:08,258
MATT: The gentleman shuffles back now with a bunch
of cups. His hands wrung through all the various

604
00:49:08,258 --> 00:49:10,500
handles. (grunts, clicks)

605
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,329
LAURA: Impressive.

606
00:49:13,387 --> 00:49:19,926
MATT: (grunts) "Two gold for both bottles."

607
00:49:19,926 --> 00:49:22,099
LAURA: I give him two gold.

608
00:49:22,099 --> 00:49:24,216
MATT: "Thank you."

609
00:49:24,216 --> 00:49:25,418
LAURA: You're welcome.

610
00:49:25,418 --> 00:49:30,305
SAM: In my earring, I say to Vex: I'm clamming up,
you do it.

611
00:49:30,305 --> 00:49:31,749
LAURA: Sir?

612
00:49:31,749 --> 00:49:36,704
MATT: You see him walking and he goes like
(sighs).

613
00:49:36,704 --> 00:49:42,464
LAURA: On your way to the back, could you tell the
Many we'd like to speak to them?

614
00:49:42,464 --> 00:49:52,092
MATT: He slowly turns his head over to the
bartender, the woman. "What was that?"

615
00:49:52,092 --> 00:49:55,493
LAURA: Oh, just a conversation with the Many.

616
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:58,475
MATT: "What about them?"

617
00:49:58,475 --> 00:50:02,775
LIAM: I dip my thumb into some wine and I use
thieves' cant and write "discuss"

618
00:50:02,775 --> 00:50:05,023
in wine on the bar.

619
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:14,992
MATT: (click) She gives a click noise to the old
man, who goes (groan, thump) Are you going to take

620
00:50:15,035 --> 00:50:16,625
your bottles or what?

621
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:18,295
LAURA: No, yeah, we'll definitely keep those.

622
00:50:18,295 --> 00:50:20,225
MATT: "All right, pick them up. Follow me."

623
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:24,669
TALIESIN: Oh, we're going to get to see the real
bar.

624
00:50:24,669 --> 00:50:30,773
MATT: He turns around and shuffles out. It's like
following a bad, slow NPC in World of Warcraft.

625
00:50:30,773 --> 00:50:37,425
You're like, just go fucking faster! His pace is
terrible. Yeah, it's awful.

626
00:50:37,425 --> 00:50:39,383
LAURA: Running ahead, turning around.

627
00:50:39,383 --> 00:50:41,440
MATT: Exactly, just waiting.

628
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,319
TRAVIS: Over here, adventurer!

629
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:52,680
MATT: Eventually, he takes you out of the small
pub, past the unused kitchen, which has another

630
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:58,583
series of stale bread clumps on the side, down to
what looks to be a broom closet. He gets there to

631
00:50:58,583 --> 00:51:01,305
the edge of the broom closet and pulls out a key
ring.

632
00:51:01,305 --> 00:51:04,915
LAURA: I want to pay attention to what key he's
taking.

633
00:51:04,915 --> 00:51:09,864
MARISHA: Can I take the bread crumbs from the
corner and throw it down

634
00:51:09,864 --> 00:51:11,451
so the rats could have it?

635
00:51:11,451 --> 00:51:15,834
MATT: Sure. So you walk over to the kitchen and
grab some of the bread crumbs and throw them down

636
00:51:15,834 --> 00:51:20,529
on the ground and you wait there, because there's
no rats present. And you're like, bread crumbs.

637
00:51:20,529 --> 00:51:27,532
They scatter a little further out. You turn around
and the minute you turn, in the air you hear

638
00:51:27,532 --> 00:51:32,235
(skittering) and look over, and there's like seven
rats that just scurried out of the shadows and are

639
00:51:32,235 --> 00:51:35,681
just going at these crumbs immediately.

640
00:51:35,681 --> 00:51:38,011
TRAVIS: I kill all of them.

641
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:40,338
LAURA: Sploosh!

642
00:51:40,338 --> 00:51:49,909
LIAM: I nudge my sister and say, all mine.

643
00:51:49,909 --> 00:51:52,530
LAURA: Yes. That she is.

644
00:51:52,530 --> 00:52:00,981
MATT: He pulls one key and unlocks the small
closet. You paid attention? (creak) Opens this

645
00:52:00,981 --> 00:52:07,411
rickety wooden door, and goes (grunt) and walks
past, and he's behind the door, expectantly

646
00:52:07,411 --> 00:52:13,197
waiting. You guys glance into the space, and you
can see there's what looks to be a low torchlight

647
00:52:13,197 --> 00:52:18,263
about every ten feet down a wooden stairway that
descends about 30, 40 feet.

648
00:52:18,263 --> 00:52:25,689
LIAM: Traps, people hiding, anything that seems
out of place or dangerous.

649
00:52:25,689 --> 00:52:27,893
MATT: Traps, or people hiding?

650
00:52:27,893 --> 00:52:29,019
LIAM: Traps.

651
00:52:29,019 --> 00:52:30,494
LAURA: I'll look for people hiding.

652
00:52:30,494 --> 00:52:35,064
MATT: Perception check, investigation check.

653
00:52:35,064 --> 00:52:39,605
LAURA: 24.

654
00:52:39,605 --> 00:52:41,199
LIAM: 24.

655
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,069
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Twinsies!

656
00:52:44,069 --> 00:52:52,116
MATT: Look at that. That's disgusting. All right,
so you guys make your way down. No traps in the

657
00:52:52,116 --> 00:52:54,942
stair descent, but you make your way to the bottom
of the stairs without issue. You don't see

658
00:52:54,942 --> 00:52:59,240
anything necessarily fishy. You do see these
torches have been burning for a little bit, a

659
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:02,929
couple hours, and are probably needing to be
re-upped pretty soon. You guys eventually make

660
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:05,574
your way down, and as soon as the last of you--
who's following up the rear in this, by the way?

661
00:53:05,574 --> 00:53:06,844
What's the marching order?

662
00:53:06,844 --> 00:53:09,368
SAM: I'll go toward the front with the twins?

663
00:53:09,368 --> 00:53:13,828
MATT: The hallway here is about big enough for you
to go single file.

664
00:53:13,828 --> 00:53:16,417
LAURA: Okay. You'll hang behind me, Tary?

665
00:53:16,417 --> 00:53:17,613
ASHLEY: I'm in front of Grog.

666
00:53:17,613 --> 00:53:19,521
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll hang with Grog and Pike.

667
00:53:19,521 --> 00:53:21,006
TALIESIN: I'm in the center, as well.

668
00:53:21,006 --> 00:53:22,369
TRAVIS: I'm in the back.

669
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:25,723
MATT: Okay, so Grog's in the very back. Keyleth,
Percy.

670
00:53:25,723 --> 00:53:30,016
LAURA: Pike is with Grog.

671
00:53:30,016 --> 00:53:35,610
MATT: Yeah, Pike's with Grog. So we'll say, Grog
in the back, then Pike, then Keyleth, then Percy,

672
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:37,821
then Taryon?

673
00:53:37,821 --> 00:53:39,064
LAURA: Yeah.

674
00:53:39,064 --> 00:53:45,771
MATT: And Vex and Vax. And you have Trinket in
your necklace, I assume? Okay. All right, so you

675
00:53:45,771 --> 00:53:51,226
guys descend down the stairway. As soon as, Grog,
you make your way in, it's tiny. You have to

676
00:53:51,226 --> 00:53:58,350
(straining) squeeze in and duck low and even just
walking through the pathway, your shoulders are

677
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:02,042
rubbing against the sides of the wall, and your
head occasionally (bang, bang).

678
00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:03,852
LAURA: It's like you in Japan, baby!

679
00:54:03,852 --> 00:54:08,717
TRAVIS: I know. Taking a shower, I broke like two
shower heads.

680
00:54:08,717 --> 00:54:12,530
Just turning around, I was like (crash).

681
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:17,683
LIAM: The beds, was that like lying down on a
saltine for you?

682
00:54:17,683 --> 00:54:20,743
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. My heels were just over like
the--

683
00:54:20,743 --> 00:54:25,316
LAURA: We went into McDonald's and his head hit
the ceiling!

684
00:54:25,316 --> 00:54:26,622
MATT: You are a kaiju!

685
00:54:26,622 --> 00:54:34,054
ASHLEY: A kaiju from the deep! A level seven!

686
00:54:34,054 --> 00:54:38,760
MARISHA: Okay, wait, before we go any further.

687
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:39,976
MATT: Okay.

688
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:41,879
MARISHA: Wait.

689
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:48,303
TRAVIS: Oh my god. Holy shit. Before we go any
further, wait.

690
00:54:48,303 --> 00:54:52,267
MARISHA: Do I have to be doing a short rest to do
the Inspiring Leader thing?

691
00:54:52,267 --> 00:54:53,940
MATT: It's ten minutes, it takes to do.

692
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,091
MARISHA: Oh, never mind.

693
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:56,971
LAURA: Well, no, we could stand here for ten
minutes!

694
00:54:56,971 --> 00:54:59,876
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, please. Fucking say some words!

695
00:54:59,876 --> 00:55:03,475
MARISHA: I'm new to the being an inspiring leader
thing.

696
00:55:03,475 --> 00:55:06,832
MATT: Yeah, it's ten minutes, before you know
you're going to go into something,

697
00:55:06,832 --> 00:55:08,244
you stop and do this.

698
00:55:08,244 --> 00:55:09,781
MARISHA: I should've done that at the bar.

699
00:55:09,781 --> 00:55:12,036
LIAM: Wouldn't that be cool if you were just
pep-talking us all the way down here?

700
00:55:12,036 --> 00:55:13,143
SAM: Start it now.

701
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,593
LAURA: Yeah, start it now! Just do it while we're
walking!

702
00:55:15,593 --> 00:55:21,833
MARISHA: Okay, okay. As we walk I'll be like: You
know what, guys? I've had a lot of time to think

703
00:55:21,888 --> 00:55:24,343
over the year that we've been away--

704
00:55:24,343 --> 00:55:26,921
MATT: The door closes behind Grog and you hear it
lock.

705
00:55:26,921 --> 00:55:38,448
MARISHA: And I feel like we've grown so much as
people, and you guys are family. You're a family

706
00:55:38,448 --> 00:55:47,708
to me. And I go on for a while. Do you guys
remember that time in Stillben? When we very first

707
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:54,047
met, and we all didn't really like each other, and
Grog, I don't think you

708
00:55:54,047 --> 00:55:55,769
understood me for a while.

709
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,228
TRAVIS: Still don't.

710
00:55:57,228 --> 00:56:01,233
MARISHA: Yeah, that's fine. That's fair. Hey Grog,
do you remember that one time--

711
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:05,680
MATT: This is great, by the way, because at the
bottom of the stairs it only goes for about 15

712
00:56:05,721 --> 00:56:08,994
more feet before there's a door. There's a man on
a stool who's just sitting there going--

713
00:56:08,994 --> 00:56:13,283
LIAM: She'll just be another minute.

714
00:56:13,283 --> 00:56:17,319
TRAVIS: I'm about to find out what the inside of a
Bag of Holding feels like, I swear.

715
00:56:17,319 --> 00:56:22,204
MATT: He's not stopping you.

716
00:56:22,204 --> 00:56:31,219
MARISHA: Do you remember that time-- I think it
was the first time I made you laugh, and I turned

717
00:56:31,219 --> 00:56:35,104
into an earth elemental, and then pretended to do
an "I'm going down the stairs"

718
00:56:35,104 --> 00:56:36,873
thing through the floor?

719
00:56:36,873 --> 00:56:37,929
TRAVIS: Oh yeah!

720
00:56:37,929 --> 00:56:44,111
MARISHA: Yeah, I just remembered that the other
day, and I just love you guys so much, you know?

721
00:56:44,111 --> 00:56:46,345
TALIESIN: I don't feel included in this.

722
00:56:46,345 --> 00:56:50,543
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't think you were around yet.
But I love you so much!

723
00:56:50,543 --> 00:56:52,205
TALIESIN: Okay, now I feel better. That's all.

724
00:56:52,205 --> 00:56:54,302
SAM: Any change in our bodies or anything?

725
00:56:54,302 --> 00:57:01,572
LIAM: She's going for ten in-game, real-time
minutes.

726
00:57:01,572 --> 00:57:11,329
MATT: As you guys are all in the hallway, Grog at
the back, you can't move forward, because

727
00:57:11,329 --> 00:57:20,095
everyone's stopped, and you're just like-- (groan)
All of you who wish to can take 17 temporary hit

728
00:57:20,158 --> 00:57:22,745
points. That's by the inspiring leader feat.

729
00:57:22,745 --> 00:57:25,472
MARISHA: Oh yeah, you want to mock until you
realize you get your hit points!

730
00:57:25,472 --> 00:57:31,650
MATT: It is your choice as to whether or not you
felt inspired by that and take them.

731
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:38,180
MARISHA: And I love you guys. I love you guys so
much.

732
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,270
MATT: Grog's too uncomfortable to take them.

733
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:43,177
TRAVIS: No, I just start weeping silently in the
back.

734
00:57:43,177 --> 00:57:45,738
LIAM: I mean, let's be honest, he wouldn't even
feel the difference.

735
00:57:45,738 --> 00:57:48,399
MATT: That's true, yeah. That's what Grog needs,
is temporary hit points.

736
00:57:48,399 --> 00:57:50,474
LIAM: Grog would just go (sneezes).

737
00:57:50,474 --> 00:57:53,182
MARISHA: Not showing your sensitivity?

738
00:57:53,182 --> 00:57:58,950
LAURA: Thanks. Thanks, Keyleth. That felt good.
That was a nice trip down memory lane.

739
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:00,254
ASHLEY: I feel inspired.

740
00:58:00,254 --> 00:58:03,129
LAURA: Oh, hey! How's it going there?

741
00:58:03,129 --> 00:58:07,978
MATT: You see this guy, he's tough and surly,
looks like a balding man who's just like made of

742
00:58:07,978 --> 00:58:12,893
muscle and anger. He's sitting there with one eye
open, one a little squinted, he's just--

743
00:58:12,893 --> 00:58:15,739
LAURA: Do you feel inspired? No.

744
00:58:15,739 --> 00:58:17,735
LIAM: Not the warm and fuzzy type, are you?

745
00:58:17,735 --> 00:58:20,971
MATT: He doesn't seem to respond. You do hear like
a series of muffled voices and what sounds like a

746
00:58:20,971 --> 00:58:24,460
faint beat of some kind from the other side of the
wall, just muffled.

747
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:31,470
TALIESIN: Is the password, "I am what I am," not
sure? Too strange a reference; never mind.

748
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:35,230
MATT: He begins to reach over for what looks to be
a small lever that's hidden on the side.

749
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:36,976
LAURA: We're here to speak to the Many.

750
00:58:36,976 --> 00:58:44,128
MATT: Stops. (grunts)

751
00:58:44,128 --> 00:58:49,406
SAM: We're in.

752
00:58:49,406 --> 00:58:51,477
LAURA: We're going to just go on in, then.

753
00:58:51,477 --> 00:58:53,507
SAM: That word just gets us in.

754
00:58:53,507 --> 00:59:05,419
MATT: So. As you guys enter this doorway, as it
pushes open, you're immediately hit with a wall of

755
00:59:05,419 --> 00:59:15,406
voices and laughter and conversation, interweaving
in multiple languages. This is far more lively

756
00:59:15,406 --> 00:59:22,036
than you expected it would be, it's a large tavern
hall. It's almost two stories tall, but it's open.

757
00:59:22,036 --> 00:59:26,742
There's a central, circular chandelier that hangs
over with what looks to be flickering candles in a

758
00:59:26,742 --> 00:59:31,471
circle around it. You can see elements of what are
almost like a second floor, but it's more like a

759
00:59:31,471 --> 00:59:36,531
slight balcony outcropping. You don't see any
doorways, it's just a level platform above, and

760
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:40,559
there before you, you see what has to be three or
four dozen people scattered across a number of

761
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:47,389
tables, all in various forms of dress and many of
them are drinking, some of them are playing games

762
00:59:47,389 --> 00:59:56,355
of chance, some of them are in deep conversation.
You can see, the music-- though this is a bad

763
00:59:56,355 --> 01:00:00,849
example, but it's what I have-- it's not a full
band, per se. It looks like there's a set of three

764
01:00:00,849 --> 01:00:06,125
percussionists in the far corner that are all in
the process of weaving this rhythmic beat that

765
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:10,907
shifts and changes. Some of them are on more of a
hand drum, some of them are more small percussion

766
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:14,791
instruments. It's interesting. It's not the usual
bar atmosphere you're used to.

767
01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:17,542
It has almost a weird--

768
01:00:17,542 --> 01:00:22,443
SAM: Would you say more like Blue Man Group or
more like a subway bucket drummer?

769
01:00:22,515 --> 01:00:27,457
MATT: I'd say it's in between the two, actually.
Take a little Blue Man Group and a little bit of

770
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:33,126
subway bucket drummer. It's right in between
there. You guys step into the chamber and take in

771
01:00:33,126 --> 01:00:39,361
the atmosphere a bit. Whether that be with smiles,
awe, or confusion and care.

772
01:00:39,361 --> 01:00:41,643
TALIESIN: That's exactly what I said, the real
bar.

773
01:00:41,643 --> 01:00:43,527
ASHLEY: I like this.

774
01:00:43,527 --> 01:00:45,736
LIAM: This is like old times.

775
01:00:45,736 --> 01:00:53,208
MATT: As soon as you begin having this
conversation and taking in the atmosphere, one of

776
01:00:53,208 --> 01:00:58,032
four bar hands sees you approach. You see a jagged
smile of a hairless man with ruddy skin that

777
01:00:58,032 --> 01:01:05,058
immediately comes up to you. "Aye, friends! New
faces are few and far between here in Deastok.

778
01:01:05,058 --> 01:01:09,762
"Welcome to our little slice of the family. What
can I get you?"

779
01:01:09,762 --> 01:01:14,987
SAM: Well, we brought bottles. That's rude, isn't
it?

780
01:01:14,987 --> 01:01:17,119
LAURA: The good stuff is down here.

781
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:19,217
MATT: "I don't know where you got that shit but
put that away.

782
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:22,191
"We'll get you right fucked up, eh?"

783
01:01:22,191 --> 01:01:24,144
MARISHA: Do you have a shiraz?

784
01:01:24,144 --> 01:01:26,405
MATT: "I'll see what I can muster."

785
01:01:26,405 --> 01:01:29,872
MARISHA: I like these people!

786
01:01:29,872 --> 01:01:39,670
MATT: "Slim pickings for room here. It's a bit
early in the evening. That's when it's the

787
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:44,546
"busiest. Just find some space, sit down. Folks
don't want you to sit by them?

788
01:01:44,546 --> 01:01:46,326
"Don't fucking sit by them."

789
01:01:46,326 --> 01:01:53,242
LAURA: Thank you. Do we see room for a large
group?

790
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:56,680
MATT: You see two tables that have room for half
of a large group.

791
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:59,098
LAURA: All right. Split up?

792
01:01:59,098 --> 01:02:02,520
SAM: Why don't we ask them nicely if they would
like to move?

793
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,035
LAURA: No, let's not do that.

794
01:02:04,035 --> 01:02:06,523
TRAVIS: Yeah, no. You do that. Go by yourself.

795
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:08,070
SAM: No?

796
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:10,219
TALIESIN: No. This is special.

797
01:02:10,219 --> 01:02:12,583
TRAVIS: How about the talkers go to one table?

798
01:02:12,583 --> 01:02:17,235
MARISHA: And then the defenders go to another in
case shit goes bad. I like that.

799
01:02:17,235 --> 01:02:21,096
TRAVIS: The Defenders' Table. Yeah, so I'm going to
the talkers' table.

800
01:02:21,096 --> 01:02:23,279
LAURA: Yeah, obviously.

801
01:02:23,279 --> 01:02:28,950
MARISHA: Vex, Tary, I feel like you guys are good
talkers.

802
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:29,988
LAURA: Right.

803
01:02:29,988 --> 01:02:31,753
TALIESIN: I'll join you.

804
01:02:31,753 --> 01:02:34,884
LIAM: I'm actually going to wander the room.

805
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:38,146
MARISHA: I'll sit with Grog and Pike.

806
01:02:38,146 --> 01:02:39,189
TRAVIS: Yeah.

807
01:02:39,189 --> 01:02:40,899
ASHLEY: Yeah, Shiraz time.

808
01:02:40,899 --> 01:02:42,584
LAURA: All right.

809
01:02:42,584 --> 01:02:49,735
SAM: What's our play here? Do we just keep saying
the word "many" as many times as we can and see

810
01:02:49,735 --> 01:02:50,692
how far it goes?

811
01:02:50,692 --> 01:02:53,713
LAURA: This is about as in as we get with the
Many.

812
01:02:53,713 --> 01:02:57,554
SAM: This is it? So now we ask for her by name? Or
him by name? Korshad?

813
01:02:57,554 --> 01:03:03,091
LAURA: Yeah. He or she may not reveal themselves
too quickly.

814
01:03:03,091 --> 01:03:04,298
SAM: All right.

815
01:03:04,298 --> 01:03:06,116
TALIESIN: We could buy Korshad a drink.

816
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:07,907
LAURA: That is a beautiful idea.

817
01:03:07,907 --> 01:03:09,277
TALIESIN: Thank you.

818
01:03:09,277 --> 01:03:12,187
LAURA: Care of one Taryon Darrington.

819
01:03:12,187 --> 01:03:15,567
SAM: Of course. I have just enough for a nice
drink.

820
01:03:15,567 --> 01:03:22,086
LAURA: Oh, we'll cover the drink, darling. Party
funds cover the drink. It's just in your name.

821
01:03:22,086 --> 01:03:25,937
SAM: Oh. Oh, okay. All right. All right. I'm slow
to catch on sometimes.

822
01:03:25,937 --> 01:03:29,368
LAURA: Can we grab a barmaid?

823
01:03:29,368 --> 01:03:42,517
MATT: You split between the two tables. One of the
tables appears to be three guys who are in a card

824
01:03:42,517 --> 01:03:48,240
game. As soon as you sit down they (grunts) and
then keep talking amongst themselves more about

825
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:53,442
taking bets, bluffing each other, giving shit
about their home lives, stuff like that. The other

826
01:03:53,442 --> 01:04:02,868
table has four quiet individuals that are, look to
be elvish lineage. Either half-elf or full elf;

827
01:04:02,868 --> 01:04:08,594
it's hard to tell. They're wearing these hoods
that show the ears from underneath but then seem

828
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:12,625
to block a lot of the features of their face and
guard a lot of the forehead. This silk hood that

829
01:04:12,625 --> 01:04:15,451
drips down past the nose on the sides.

830
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:20,311
LAURA: Do we recognize any semblance of that
garb?

831
01:04:20,311 --> 01:04:22,215
MATT: Make a history check.

832
01:04:22,215 --> 01:04:24,307
SAM: History check.

833
01:04:24,307 --> 01:04:30,639
LAURA: Well, my history is shit, but 19.

834
01:04:30,639 --> 01:04:45,245
MATT: 19. You haven't seen this kind of dress, but
you've heard of it. It seems to be of Wildmount

835
01:04:45,245 --> 01:04:52,018
but the eastern side of Wildmount, not a part of
the Dwendalian Empire. This more stems from

836
01:04:52,018 --> 01:05:00,978
Zorhaus, which is the other kingdom on the
continent. It's actually in a tense existence

837
01:05:00,978 --> 01:05:03,939
along the border of the Dwendalian Empire.

838
01:05:03,939 --> 01:05:07,438
LAURA: You said it was to the east?

839
01:05:07,438 --> 01:05:09,269
MATT: Zorhaus, I'm pretty sure that's what it's
called.

840
01:05:09,269 --> 01:05:11,190
LAURA: It is now.

841
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:14,711
MATT: It is! It's whatever it's called in the
campaign guide.

842
01:05:14,711 --> 01:05:19,507
LAURA: Oh! Oh man, that's right. Now you have to
stick to what you wrote. That's crazy.

843
01:05:19,507 --> 01:05:26,131
MATT: I know, I'll just have to look it up again.
But anyway. As soon as you sit down at the table

844
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:32,209
the four individuals look at each other and then
get up from the table and then walk off to find

845
01:05:32,209 --> 01:05:33,594
another place.

846
01:05:33,594 --> 01:05:41,486
LAURA: Maybe some of us don't smell very good in
this group. I'm not one of them, though.

847
01:05:41,486 --> 01:05:42,837
I smell amazing.

848
01:05:42,837 --> 01:05:48,425
LIAM: I smell fucking fantastic, and I'm over
there. I am going to laze about the musicians and

849
01:05:48,425 --> 01:05:51,838
listen to the musicians and wait for them to
finish a set.

850
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:52,913
MATT: Okay.

851
01:05:52,913 --> 01:05:56,769
LAURA: I guess all of us can sit at the table
because of the people--

852
01:05:56,769 --> 01:06:02,918
MATT: All of you guys can sit at the table now
that you've forced them off their own space. The

853
01:06:02,918 --> 01:06:09,125
guys playing the card game seemed to pay no mind.
As you sit around the table, the barhand that met

854
01:06:09,246 --> 01:06:14,555
you here approaches and once more goes, "All
right, looks like you've found a place to sit,

855
01:06:14,555 --> 01:06:20,257
"what can I get you? Got you that shiraz you were
asking for, eh." He goes ahead and he pulls up

856
01:06:20,257 --> 01:06:28,036
what looks to be a dark green bottle, already uncorked
and he brings over a hefty metallic goblet or

857
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:36,977
tankard and then pours it in there. It appears to
be something akin to a shiraz, I suppose. Fills it

858
01:06:36,977 --> 01:06:42,977
to the top, slides it forward. "All right. Drinks
for anyone else, eh?"

859
01:06:42,977 --> 01:06:47,779
TRAVIS: Yeah, you got any pies or meat or both?

860
01:06:47,779 --> 01:06:49,454
TALIESIN: To drink.

861
01:06:49,454 --> 01:06:52,857
TRAVIS: Do they not have food?

862
01:06:52,857 --> 01:06:54,427
LAURA: No, probably.

863
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:57,930
MATT: "I can get you a meat pie, if that's what
you're asking. I don't recommend you drink it,

864
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:01,937
"though you could probably squeeze water from a
stone, so wouldn't surprise me if you could."

865
01:07:01,937 --> 01:07:04,113
TRAVIS: Yeah, meat pie and an ale, please.

866
01:07:04,113 --> 01:07:07,103
MATT: "All right, coming on up. Anyone else?"

867
01:07:07,103 --> 01:07:08,358
LAURA: Whiskey?

868
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:09,892
TALIESIN: Same.

869
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:13,224
MATT: "It can be done. So whiskey. And you, little
one?"

870
01:07:13,224 --> 01:07:18,216
ASHLEY: Well, you said you have things that will
fuck you up right,

871
01:07:18,216 --> 01:07:20,477
so what would that be considered?

872
01:07:20,477 --> 01:07:26,199
MATT: "Oh, I mean no offense, lady, but you're a
bit small-sized--"

873
01:07:26,199 --> 01:07:28,623
ALL: Whoa!

874
01:07:28,623 --> 01:07:35,022
MATT: "I mean that respectfully! Look, I'm just
looking out for my patrons here. I don't want to

875
01:07:35,022 --> 01:07:38,929
"go ahead and send someone to the local temple."

876
01:07:38,929 --> 01:07:41,684
LAURA: She can drink most people under the table.

877
01:07:41,684 --> 01:07:42,951
ASHLEY: Bring it!

878
01:07:42,951 --> 01:07:45,580
MATT: "All right. I'll take your word for it,
then."

879
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:47,979
SAM: I'll have another shiraz.

880
01:07:47,979 --> 01:07:49,863
MATT: "Another shiraz."

881
01:07:49,863 --> 01:07:54,161
LIAM: Over the earring: Pickle, will you get me
one of those, as well, and don't drink it before I

882
01:07:54,161 --> 01:07:55,211
come back?

883
01:07:55,211 --> 01:07:57,926
ASHLEY: As a matter of fact, I want two of
whatever that is.

884
01:07:57,926 --> 01:08:03,824
MATT: "All right, coming up." And he leaves the
table.

885
01:08:03,824 --> 01:08:08,825
TALIESIN: Did you order the drink for when he
comes back?

886
01:08:08,825 --> 01:08:17,822
SAM: Oh the other drink? Oh fuck. Wait, before he
goes, pardon me. I have one more order to make. I

887
01:08:17,822 --> 01:08:27,071
would like to buy a drink for Korshad, courtesy of
Taryon Darrington.

888
01:08:27,071 --> 01:08:30,390
And I'll slip him a gold piece.

889
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:33,024
TRAVIS: I thought you were about to shake his hand
with two fingers.

890
01:08:33,024 --> 01:08:38,085
SAM: There is a coin between the two fingers.

891
01:08:38,085 --> 01:08:42,089
MATT: "Korshad, you say?"

892
01:08:42,089 --> 01:08:43,690
SAM: Yes.

893
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:44,905
MATT: "All right."

894
01:08:44,905 --> 01:08:47,622
LAURA: I nudge him under the table.

895
01:08:47,622 --> 01:08:49,899
MATT: "You want what he likes, it's going to cost
you more than that."

896
01:08:49,899 --> 01:08:51,624
LAURA: What does he like?

897
01:08:51,624 --> 01:08:59,480
SAM: Whatever it is, here is another four and keep
another one for yourself.

898
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:06,001
MATT: "Thank you very much. That'll put you up to
yours, though. We will go ahead and settle your

899
01:09:06,001 --> 01:09:12,541
"bills at the end of the drinks. But all right,
Korshad it is."

900
01:09:12,541 --> 01:09:17,248
TALIESIN: What table did the bartender look at
when he said that?

901
01:09:17,248 --> 01:09:19,170
MATT: Make a perception check.

902
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:22,322
LAURA: Oh, I was planning on totally watching
that, too.

903
01:09:22,322 --> 01:09:26,369
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's a safe 13.

904
01:09:26,369 --> 01:09:28,303
LAURA: Should I roll, too?

905
01:09:28,303 --> 01:09:31,603
MATT: Well, you said you were looking, too, so
roll a perception, yeah.

906
01:09:31,603 --> 01:09:37,963
LAURA: Well yeah, okay. 30.

907
01:09:37,963 --> 01:09:47,676
MATT: 30, okay. You gather the direction that he
glanced. It was a cursory look, more to see if the

908
01:09:47,733 --> 01:09:54,327
individual in question was still in the room or
not. But you got the direction of it, and you know

909
01:09:54,327 --> 01:10:02,026
exactly where he was looking-- three tables and
that way there. He leaves for a bit, and the

910
01:10:02,026 --> 01:10:10,041
laughter is still rising and falling throughout
the room. The musicians in the corner, which are

911
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:17,433
two younger human boys and what appears to be a
female goliath, who has the heavier drum in the

912
01:10:17,433 --> 01:10:25,333
center, who is like the mid-piece, the big (heavy
drum noises). The two guys, one of them has a

913
01:10:25,333 --> 01:10:32,165
small set of lap drums, (light drum noises) the
faster beats. And the guy to the left of her--

914
01:10:32,165 --> 01:10:37,479
they could be brothers; you're not too sure, their
features are similar but different enough, the

915
01:10:37,522 --> 01:10:43,982
ages seem off. The guy on the left has a series of
small wooden blocks and what looks to be some sort

916
01:10:43,982 --> 01:10:48,062
of contraption that has three or four different
small percussion instruments that are all fixed to

917
01:10:48,062 --> 01:10:52,873
it and so he is leaping between them all. For
being just percussion, that variety is still

918
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:58,447
making a cool melody. You're still able to find
certain notes and certain blends where it still is

919
01:10:58,447 --> 01:11:03,875
a very different and unique atmosphere. They
manage to bring to this crescendo the piece that

920
01:11:03,875 --> 01:11:08,627
you entered on, and it finishes. There is no
real-- there is occasionally a couple of claps here

921
01:11:08,627 --> 01:11:10,519
and most everyone is busy about their own shit.

922
01:11:10,567 --> 01:11:13,482
LIAM: All right, I clap. Excuse me, players?

923
01:11:13,482 --> 01:11:18,824
MATT: As they're both looking over to grab a drink
to stop and the younger guy with a scruffy chin

924
01:11:18,824 --> 01:11:23,058
and this mop of hair that's a little wild glances
over to you: "Yeah?"

925
01:11:23,058 --> 01:11:28,499
LIAM: That was a really unique piece you guys just
did there. Thank you.

926
01:11:28,499 --> 01:11:30,939
MATT: "You're welcome."

927
01:11:30,939 --> 01:11:37,547
LIAM: You know, I have only ever heard music like
that one time, and it wasn't here. It wasn't in

928
01:11:37,547 --> 01:11:46,830
this city, it was actually in Emon. What was his
name? Dranzel. It was a musician named Dranzel--

929
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:54,134
this is a long shot, but you haven't come across a
Dr. Dranzel in your travels? I've always wanted to

930
01:11:54,134 --> 01:11:55,456
hear him play again.

931
01:11:55,456 --> 01:11:57,951
MATT: "Can't say I have, sir. My apologies."

932
01:11:58,026 --> 01:11:59,318
LIAM: Oh, shit.

933
01:11:59,318 --> 01:12:06,637
MATT: "Sorry. You guys ever heard of Dr. Dranzel?"
And the other guy goes, "Nope."

934
01:12:06,637 --> 01:12:08,627
LIAM: Orcish. Stylish hats.

935
01:12:08,627 --> 01:12:14,488
MATT: The goliath woman is sitting there and she is
just staring off across the room and goes, "No."

936
01:12:14,488 --> 01:12:18,505
(laughter)

937
01:12:18,505 --> 01:12:20,564
MATT: "Sorry, friend."

938
01:12:20,564 --> 01:12:26,691
LAURA: I'm keeping an eye on the side of the room
that he glanced in, looking for anybody going and

939
01:12:26,691 --> 01:12:28,515
delivering drinks to the people.

940
01:12:28,515 --> 01:12:33,768
MATT: Okay. You watch the gentleman who has been
getting you guys drinks, and he is in the process

941
01:12:33,768 --> 01:12:41,584
of getting all of your various drink orders and
pouring what you have requested, and he does come

942
01:12:41,584 --> 01:12:49,142
to a point where he gets this one fine jewel
goblet that he has specifically set off to the

943
01:12:49,142 --> 01:12:54,981
side and he takes it and washes it and takes care
to clean it entirely and dry it off, and once it's

944
01:12:54,981 --> 01:12:59,577
set there he reaches underneath, counting a few
bottles and pulls one drink, uncorks it and there

945
01:12:59,577 --> 01:13:07,457
is this thick dark brown glass jug and as he
uncorks it he pours it into there, glances over,

946
01:13:07,457 --> 01:13:11,513
grabs another thing, seems to be mixing it with
something else. He is being very careful with the

947
01:13:11,513 --> 01:13:19,124
actual amounts he is pouring. He finishes that,
takes a piece of what looks like an orange,

948
01:13:19,124 --> 01:13:28,999
crushes it in the inside and leaves the rind and
takes it and swishes it for a second. (sighs) And

949
01:13:29,056 --> 01:13:34,637
walks over to a table across the entire hall,
where you saw him glance before.

950
01:13:34,682 --> 01:13:36,807
SAM: One sex on the beach!

951
01:13:36,807 --> 01:13:40,090
(laughter)

952
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:49,142
MATT: He walks over to a table where you see what
appear to be about five different patrons at the

953
01:13:49,142 --> 01:13:57,164
table. Most of them wealthily dressed. Two of them
appear to be older mercantile or business owners,

954
01:13:57,164 --> 01:14:03,410
they wear the jewelry on their hands very
extravagantly and displaying both wealth and

955
01:14:03,410 --> 01:14:14,509
prestige to an ostentatious way that you know most
high-end guild workers or owners tend to display.

956
01:14:14,509 --> 01:14:17,994
You are very familiar with caste systems that have
emerged in a lot of these central metropolitan

957
01:14:17,994 --> 01:14:25,539
areas, and so you can very easily pick up some of
those themes. Two of them appear as a contrast

958
01:14:25,539 --> 01:14:31,462
very simply dressed. No jewelry. You can't make
out any details in this distance and there is one

959
01:14:31,462 --> 01:14:36,553
man who he hands the drink to, he sets it down in
front of him and slides it forward. The man you

960
01:14:36,553 --> 01:14:42,121
see there, he has deep brown skin, marked, there
appear to be a number of tattoos that curl up his

961
01:14:42,121 --> 01:14:49,111
arms and up the side of his neck and touch his ears
on each side. He's wearing light, billowing

962
01:14:49,111 --> 01:14:56,817
clothes of silver and maroon silks that end about
the elbow and are just hanging beneath, leaving

963
01:14:56,817 --> 01:15:01,123
the rest of his arm completely visible where you
can see the tattoo continues up the forearm and

964
01:15:01,123 --> 01:15:06,871
grasps the back of the hand, almost like he has a
gauntlet on that is just his skin. You see around

965
01:15:06,871 --> 01:15:14,188
him a series of gold and silver bracelets and
rings that adorn his fingers. His face is framed

966
01:15:14,188 --> 01:15:22,730
by a lion's mane of black and gray dreadlocked
hair. Because of your perception check, at this

967
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:27,898
distance and your ranger-like eyes, you can see
what you perceive to be a visible scar on his

968
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:34,562
throat from ear to ear. He's currently
mid-conversation with the patrons at the table,

969
01:15:34,562 --> 01:15:40,340
leaned back in his chair in a comfortable setting
and as soon as the drink-- huh?

970
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:42,406
LAURA: Can I read his lips?

971
01:15:42,406 --> 01:15:49,857
MATT: Sure. Well, the drink arrives and gets
pushed forward and you read the barkeep's lips as

972
01:15:49,857 --> 01:15:58,674
he says, "This drink is a gift to you from patrons
on the other side of the place." And this

973
01:15:58,674 --> 01:16:04,610
individual, who you assume at this point is
probably Korshad, gives a look and goes, (grunts).

974
01:16:04,610 --> 01:16:10,409
And he points over, right over to your table
across the room. You watch as Korshad

975
01:16:10,451 --> 01:16:22,768
sits up, glances over your direction, sees you
looking at him directly. Takes the drink, scoots

976
01:16:22,768 --> 01:16:27,710
it over next to his side, and folds his fingers
and goes back into listening to the conversation

977
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:35,501
of the other patrons. And the barkeep who is
standing there is, "Right." And then goes back to

978
01:16:35,501 --> 01:16:40,540
the bar, gathers the rest of your drinks and
brings them slowly over to your table and passes

979
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:46,777
them out. "All right, got a second shiraz, for you
there, sir. We've got a whiskey, and a whiskey. We

980
01:16:46,777 --> 01:16:54,771
"got an ale and a meat pie for you. And you,
well--" (laughs) He brings up these two mugs.

981
01:16:54,771 --> 01:17:00,204
They're simple ceramic mugs that are dark and
handcrafted, and he sloshes them up to you and as

982
01:17:00,204 --> 01:17:07,048
you see inside, most ale has a good liquidy
content. This has a very syrupy thick texture to

983
01:17:07,048 --> 01:17:12,827
it. He slides both forward and goes, "I don't
expect you to drink both those back to back."

984
01:17:12,827 --> 01:17:22,257
ASHLEY: Well, that's not up for you to decide, my
friend. I get on my earring. Hey, String Bean,

985
01:17:22,257 --> 01:17:23,960
your drink is here.

986
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:31,928
LIAM: Yeah, and Sarenrae will know if you drink it
before I get back, so just hold onto it for me.

987
01:17:31,928 --> 01:17:34,122
ASHLEY: Well, I can't make any promises.

988
01:17:34,122 --> 01:17:38,389
MATT: And he leans forward and goes, "This here is
the Change-Bringer's Nectar.

989
01:17:38,389 --> 01:17:40,456
"You sip this, slowly."

990
01:17:40,456 --> 01:17:42,964
LAURA: The Change-Bringer's Nectar?

991
01:17:42,964 --> 01:17:52,526
MARISHA: Write that shit down. Can Keyleth get up
and walk past the diplomats' table

992
01:17:52,526 --> 01:17:54,989
and run my hands--

993
01:17:54,989 --> 01:17:56,875
MATT: Well, you guys are all at the same table
now.

994
01:17:56,875 --> 01:17:58,099
MARISHA: Oh, we're at the same table now?

995
01:17:58,099 --> 01:18:00,321
MATT: Yeah, one table got up as soon as you sat
down.

996
01:18:00,321 --> 01:18:08,645
MARISHA: Oh, so we scootched together? Okay, then
I'm just going to lean into Vex and give her an

997
01:18:08,645 --> 01:18:10,850
Enhance Ability on her charisma.

998
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:13,953
LAURA: Ooh! I'll take that.

999
01:18:13,953 --> 01:18:15,550
MATT: Okay.

1000
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:19,350
MARISHA: You get advantage--

1001
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:21,054
LAURA: On charisma checks?

1002
01:18:21,054 --> 01:18:22,767
MARISHA: Yeah. On checks.

1003
01:18:22,767 --> 01:18:27,890
LAURA: I like it.

1004
01:18:27,890 --> 01:18:30,750
MARISHA: Her cleavage gets a little nicer.

1005
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:33,716
LAURA: It can't get any nicer than it already is.

1006
01:18:33,716 --> 01:18:35,193
TALIESIN: Very fair.

1007
01:18:35,193 --> 01:18:37,348
LIAM: All said out loud.

1008
01:18:37,348 --> 01:18:46,323
TALIESIN: Pike, which one of those two is Vax's?
Which one of those two belongs to Vax?

1009
01:18:46,323 --> 01:18:47,480
ASHLEY: This one.

1010
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:49,521
TALIESIN: Oh that one? I'm taking a sip of it.

1011
01:18:49,521 --> 01:18:51,499
ASHLEY: Take a sip. It's very thick.

1012
01:18:51,499 --> 01:18:59,440
MATT: It's very thick, and it's sweeter than you
expected, but it has a definite burn that grows

1013
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:09,444
and grows after drinking it. It's syrupy, but
because of its syrupy texture, as it goes down it

1014
01:19:09,444 --> 01:19:13,072
also coats and numbs everything as it touches.

1015
01:19:13,072 --> 01:19:15,615
LIAM: Percy, I saw that. You have to buy me a
whole other drink.

1016
01:19:15,615 --> 01:19:20,432
TALIESIN: That's fine. I put my whiskey in its
place and take the whole cup.

1017
01:19:20,432 --> 01:19:27,111
LIAM: No motherfucker, that's not what I said! I
want to drink that one and the one after it! Oh,

1018
01:19:27,111 --> 01:19:30,365
you don't want to start with me, Fredrickstein.

1019
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:32,904
TRAVIS: Are you sipping it?

1020
01:19:32,904 --> 01:19:39,710
ASHLEY: I'm sipping it. I'm doing as the locals
do. Enjoying it how he told me.

1021
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:42,449
MATT: And you get the sense it's probably a good
thing.

1022
01:19:42,449 --> 01:19:44,578
ASHLEY: It burns!

1023
01:19:44,578 --> 01:19:53,101
MATT: It's almost like maple syrup Everclear.

1024
01:19:53,101 --> 01:19:54,719
ASHLEY: Ugh!

1025
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:56,204
LAURA: Gross!

1026
01:19:56,204 --> 01:19:59,927
TRAVIS: How's my meat pie?

1027
01:19:59,927 --> 01:20:01,539
MATT: Meat pie's pretty good!

1028
01:20:01,539 --> 01:20:03,150
TRAVIS: This is pretty good!

1029
01:20:03,150 --> 01:20:06,880
LAURA: That makes me want an empanada right now.

1030
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:09,400
LIAM: Role-playing, guys.

1031
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:13,634
MATT: Sadly, no empanadas in Deastok.

1032
01:20:13,634 --> 01:20:19,985
SAM: Why isn't he coming over here? Should we send
another drink? Maybe two this time.

1033
01:20:19,985 --> 01:20:21,636
LAURA: He's in the middle of a conversation right
now.

1034
01:20:21,636 --> 01:20:23,053
TALIESIN: He has to sit and enjoy his drink.

1035
01:20:23,053 --> 01:20:24,398
LAURA: Let him take some time.

1036
01:20:24,398 --> 01:20:28,605
ASHLEY: (slurring words) Should we sent him a
Change-Bringer's Nectar? Oh no!

1037
01:20:28,605 --> 01:20:32,071
LAURA: Oh no, Pike!

1038
01:20:32,071 --> 01:20:36,399
ASHLEY: (still slurring) I only had like three
drinks. Three sips.

1039
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:37,976
TRAVIS: Keep going.

1040
01:20:37,976 --> 01:20:41,105
LAURA: Just tiny sips.

1041
01:20:41,105 --> 01:20:43,266
ASHLEY: They were so small.

1042
01:20:43,266 --> 01:20:45,625
LAURA: Drink some, maybe some water, too, in
between each sip.

1043
01:20:45,625 --> 01:20:48,441
ASHLEY: Okay. Maybe some meat pie.

1044
01:20:48,441 --> 01:20:50,802
TALIESIN: That's whiskey. That's supposed to be--
never mind. Go ahead.

1045
01:20:50,802 --> 01:20:58,606
MARISHA: Hey, who's the Change-Bringer? Does
anyone know? I feel like this drink is inspired.

1046
01:20:58,606 --> 01:21:02,057
Can I do a check to see?

1047
01:21:02,057 --> 01:21:03,288
MATT: Make a religion check.

1048
01:21:03,288 --> 01:21:06,902
MARISHA: Aw, I'm not good at this. Pike, you know
gods!

1049
01:21:06,902 --> 01:21:11,611
ASHLEY: Let me see if I know. Will I know the
Change-Bringer?

1050
01:21:11,611 --> 01:21:17,384
MARISHA: Oh, please. I have no idea. I definitely
have zero idea.

1051
01:21:17,384 --> 01:21:26,424
ASHLEY: I'm going to see if I can think of it.
14.

1052
01:21:26,424 --> 01:21:32,013
MATT: It's really not that hard. The
Change-Bringer is Avandra. Avandra, one of the

1053
01:21:32,013 --> 01:21:33,227
gods of the pantheon.

1054
01:21:33,227 --> 01:21:35,520
MARISHA: Oh. Yeah, of course we knew that.

1055
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:47,618
MATT: The Change-Bringer is the deity that looks
over luck, looks over adventure, travel, the open

1056
01:21:47,618 --> 01:21:56,759
road. That's as much as you can glean from your
passing knowledge of the deity. Since you are not

1057
01:21:56,759 --> 01:22:00,742
a woman of faith, obviously, you don't know
much beyond that.

1058
01:22:00,742 --> 01:22:02,450
MARISHA: It just sounded fancy.

1059
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:04,223
ASHLEY: It sounded so fancy.

1060
01:22:04,223 --> 01:22:11,875
MATT: She's also known as "she who makes the
path."

1061
01:22:11,875 --> 01:22:14,933
LAURA: Hey, Tary.

1062
01:22:14,933 --> 01:22:17,209
SAM: Yes? Is it time? Should I go over there?

1063
01:22:17,209 --> 01:22:20,815
LAURA: Just calm down. This is mainly what I'm
trying to tell you right now.

1064
01:22:20,815 --> 01:22:22,561
Stop being so weird.

1065
01:22:22,561 --> 01:22:24,938
ASHLEY: Do you want a sip of Change-Bringer's
Nectar?

1066
01:22:24,938 --> 01:22:26,785
LAURA: It might actually help you just a little
bit.

1067
01:22:26,785 --> 01:22:31,525
TALIESIN: Do what we do any time there's trouble.
Sit down, pay attention,

1068
01:22:31,525 --> 01:22:33,041
and do everything she says.

1069
01:22:33,041 --> 01:22:37,044
LAURA: And don't look sneaky.

1070
01:22:37,044 --> 01:22:39,803
TALIESIN: Have a sip of this. It'll help.

1071
01:22:39,803 --> 01:22:42,863
LAURA: Yeah, seriously. Just have a little sip. A
little sip,

1072
01:22:42,863 --> 01:22:45,129
it's always good to relax your nerves.

1073
01:22:45,129 --> 01:22:46,236
SAM: All right.

1074
01:22:46,236 --> 01:22:47,441
ASHLEY: Loosey-goosey.

1075
01:22:47,441 --> 01:22:49,754
SAM: I'll take my helm and cock it to the side.

1076
01:22:49,754 --> 01:22:53,286
LAURA: Yeah, jauntily. That's good, yeah.

1077
01:22:53,286 --> 01:22:55,830
TALIESIN: Okay, now I feel like I'm on a
listing ship.

1078
01:22:55,872 --> 01:23:04,841
TRAVIS: What's your confident face look like? More
tongue. Little further. Yep. Little higher eyebrow

1079
01:23:04,924 --> 01:23:06,332
on the right side.

1080
01:23:06,332 --> 01:23:09,625
LAURA: Okay, maybe stop. I'm just afraid he's
going to look over here at any moment. I'm keeping

1081
01:23:09,625 --> 01:23:18,462
an eye on good old Korshad, and seeing if he looks
over here. I also want to see if I can catch his

1082
01:23:18,462 --> 01:23:22,148
lips and see what he's talking about over on the
side there.

1083
01:23:22,148 --> 01:23:26,886
LIAM: And I would like to look around the room and
make sure that other people aren't watching us, or

1084
01:23:26,886 --> 01:23:29,477
if so, where in the bar they are.

1085
01:23:29,477 --> 01:23:30,751
MATT: Make a perception check.

1086
01:23:30,751 --> 01:23:33,142
TRAVIS: And I would like to make my way over to
the goliath woman.

1087
01:23:33,142 --> 01:23:42,692
MATT: Okay. So as you begin walking in that
direction, Vex. Couple things. One, you notice

1088
01:23:42,736 --> 01:23:47,660
that Korshad, while he seems to be mostly being
talked at or at least just listening to a

1089
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:51,064
conversation, when he does speak, he leans in and
does this.

1090
01:23:51,064 --> 01:23:52,774
LAURA: Of course he fucking does.

1091
01:23:52,774 --> 01:23:59,042
MATT: You get the sense he's a very guarded man
and this is not his first rodeo. He speaks through

1092
01:23:59,042 --> 01:24:00,149
his fingers.

1093
01:24:00,149 --> 01:24:03,164
LAURA: I do, too!

1094
01:24:03,164 --> 01:24:10,334
MATT: But he doesn't appear to look over at your
table again. He seems to have acknowledged the

1095
01:24:10,334 --> 01:24:16,260
drink, is enjoying it slowly, and is back
enthralled by the conversation at his table. What

1096
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:17,446
did you roll?

1097
01:24:17,446 --> 01:24:18,231
LIAM: 25.

1098
01:24:18,231 --> 01:24:20,281
MATT: 25. And what did you say you were going to
do?

1099
01:24:20,281 --> 01:24:21,431
MARISHA: Mimic Vex.

1100
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:24,098
MATT: Okay. You both cover your mouths.

1101
01:24:24,098 --> 01:24:25,493
LAURA: What are you doing?

1102
01:24:25,493 --> 01:24:26,886
MARISHA: I'm following your lead.

1103
01:24:26,886 --> 01:24:28,947
LAURA: You don't have to do that.

1104
01:24:28,947 --> 01:24:32,892
TALIESIN: Does this one still work? We can do this
one.

1105
01:24:32,892 --> 01:24:34,548
LAURA: Yeah, that one's good. Just this.

1106
01:24:34,548 --> 01:24:36,357
ASHLEY: Is this good?

1107
01:24:36,357 --> 01:24:44,431
LAURA: That's it, Pike. Pike's got it. He's
definitely going to come over and talk to us now,

1108
01:24:44,431 --> 01:24:46,668
I can feel it. We're so cool.

1109
01:24:46,668 --> 01:24:50,397
TALIESIN: This is a lot of drink that I seem to
have taken on.

1110
01:24:50,397 --> 01:24:57,943
MATT: Vax. Glancing about the chamber, remember I
said there was a secondary platform, that didn't

1111
01:24:57,943 --> 01:25:02,834
have any doorways to rooms, but there was just the
upper walkway across the room both ways? There are

1112
01:25:02,834 --> 01:25:05,970
about six figures on each one.

1113
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:07,443
LIAM: Six on each one?

1114
01:25:07,443 --> 01:25:15,241
MATT: They're all sitting there, wearing leather
armor, mostly covered by a cloak. You glance up

1115
01:25:15,241 --> 01:25:19,150
and you can see underneath at least two of the
cloaks what appear to be the shape or outline of a

1116
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:21,197
crossbow at the ready.

1117
01:25:21,197 --> 01:25:24,576
TALIESIN: 12 of them? 12 men?

1118
01:25:24,576 --> 01:25:36,728
LIAM: I relay to the group quietly, yes. Packing.
12 or so above us all, so no sudden movements.

1119
01:25:36,728 --> 01:25:42,230
MATT: The music picks up again, Grog, as you're
walking over. The next piece is occurring and you

1120
01:25:42,230 --> 01:25:48,351
can see now that while the previous one had a
frenetic tribal beat, this one has more of a

1121
01:25:48,351 --> 01:25:55,708
scattered, if I could say percussion jazz sense.
It tends to have multiple changes. Yeah, if you

1122
01:25:55,708 --> 01:26:05,293
could. If you haven't heard the jazz timpani
before, it's fantastic. It's more of an

1123
01:26:05,293 --> 01:26:08,033
improvisational piece. You can see where they're
each building off of each other, and then one will

1124
01:26:08,033 --> 01:26:11,957
make a change and the others will shift with it.
You don't notice this, because you really don't

1125
01:26:11,957 --> 01:26:18,385
care, but anybody who had musical interests would
be able to pick up on this. But you walk up and

1126
01:26:18,385 --> 01:26:26,548
you see the goliath woman. Most of the goliath
women you've come across, their lifestyle leads to

1127
01:26:26,548 --> 01:26:37,314
either very short-kept or very tightly bound hair,
as the coarse hair of the goliaths tends to mat up

1128
01:26:37,314 --> 01:26:43,615
very thickly when living in the wild as your tribe
did. This goliath female's hair is really well

1129
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:52,444
kept, actually. It's almost shining, which catches
you off guard entirely. She's not tattooed and

1130
01:26:52,444 --> 01:26:58,070
appears to be in a trance as she's in the process
of drumming away, not even looking at the two of

1131
01:26:58,070 --> 01:27:02,102
her compatriots or any patron. She's spacing out
and is currently enraptured

1132
01:27:02,102 --> 01:27:03,817
by the music she's creating.

1133
01:27:03,817 --> 01:27:07,141
TRAVIS: Are there any weapons around her feet or
where she's sitting or playing?

1134
01:27:07,141 --> 01:27:10,698
MATT: Make a perception check.

1135
01:27:10,698 --> 01:27:12,185
TRAVIS: Three.

1136
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:18,826
MATT: She has very nice boots. And as a man who
has made boots in the past, you can acknowledge,

1137
01:27:18,826 --> 01:27:20,994
those are very well-made boots.

1138
01:27:20,994 --> 01:27:23,817
TRAVIS: Me Grog!

1139
01:27:23,817 --> 01:27:33,596
LIAM: I just love the alacrity that Travis goes to
two, three. It's so good.

1140
01:27:33,596 --> 01:27:37,036
TRAVIS: You play good!

1141
01:27:37,036 --> 01:27:42,579
MATT: The head slowly turns and the eyes focus for
a second in the dim, snow-blind looking pupils,

1142
01:27:42,579 --> 01:27:44,356
and gives you a nod.

1143
01:27:44,356 --> 01:27:47,877
TRAVIS: Nice hair.

1144
01:27:47,877 --> 01:27:50,969
MATT: Head turns a little to the side.

1145
01:27:50,969 --> 01:27:58,235
TRAVIS: I'll be-- if you--

1146
01:27:58,235 --> 01:28:01,233
ASHLEY: Tell her she has nice boots, Grog.

1147
01:28:01,233 --> 01:28:02,269
TRAVIS: What?

1148
01:28:02,269 --> 01:28:04,781
ASHLEY: Tell her she has nice boots.

1149
01:28:04,781 --> 01:28:05,974
TRAVIS: Nice boobs!

1150
01:28:05,974 --> 01:28:14,043
MATT: (bang) Big drum hit, and her part of the
song comes to a halt. The two other bits of music

1151
01:28:14,043 --> 01:28:18,039
alter but continue the beats, and she just--

1152
01:28:18,039 --> 01:28:32,984
TRAVIS: Boots. Nice boots. Bidet. And I go back to
the group.

1153
01:28:32,984 --> 01:28:39,455
MATT: As you walk back to the group, a little
dejected, Vax, since you're the one who's paying

1154
01:28:39,455 --> 01:28:43,195
attention the most at this point, you notice as
the goliath gets this small grin on the side of

1155
01:28:43,195 --> 01:28:46,180
her face and continues to go back to the drums.

1156
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:48,203
LAURA: You charmed her!

1157
01:28:48,203 --> 01:28:49,662
MARISHA: Look at you!

1158
01:28:49,662 --> 01:28:52,153
LIAM: Nice work, de Bergerac!

1159
01:28:52,153 --> 01:28:54,969
MATT: But Grog doesn't see it.

1160
01:28:54,969 --> 01:28:57,459
ASHLEY: I'll be your Cyrano!

1161
01:28:57,459 --> 01:29:02,675
MATT: All right. So what's the next order of
business, guys?

1162
01:29:02,675 --> 01:29:05,467
TALIESIN: Is that conversation breaking up?

1163
01:29:05,467 --> 01:29:10,138
LAURA: That's what I planned on doing, is waiting
out that conversation. I in no way want to

1164
01:29:10,138 --> 01:29:11,263
interrupt it.

1165
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:17,188
MATT: About 20 additional minutes go by. Another
round is bought at the table, with Korshad still

1166
01:29:17,188 --> 01:29:22,492
slowly, very carefully sipping the drink that you
guys bought for him. Doesn't appear to be slowing,

1167
01:29:22,492 --> 01:29:25,603
doesn't appear to be breaking. You can keep
waiting if you want.

1168
01:29:25,603 --> 01:29:28,306
LAURA: I want to get one of those fancy drinks for
myself and see what it is.

1169
01:29:28,306 --> 01:29:30,783
SAM: You mean the Korshad drink?

1170
01:29:30,783 --> 01:29:32,892
LAURA: I want one of the Korshad drinks.

1171
01:29:32,892 --> 01:29:35,327
MATT: One of the Korshad drinks, okay.

1172
01:29:35,327 --> 01:29:39,558
TALIESIN: I would assume you've already had this
stuff at this point. We've been sharing a cup

1173
01:29:39,558 --> 01:29:41,992
around. This is too much for a human being to
handle.

1174
01:29:41,992 --> 01:29:45,505
MATT: Do you go to the bar?

1175
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:53,787
LAURA: I'll go up to the bar. We don't know his
name, do we? The bartender's name?

1176
01:29:53,787 --> 01:29:57,304
MATT: You haven't asked him yet, no. There are a
few barhands that walk around, but the one you've

1177
01:29:57,304 --> 01:30:00,391
been going with, you can go ahead and catch his
eye as you go through the area.

1178
01:30:00,391 --> 01:30:02,678
"Hey, do you need something?"

1179
01:30:02,678 --> 01:30:04,497
LAURA: Of course, darling. I didn't catch your
name.

1180
01:30:04,497 --> 01:30:05,541
MATT: "Oh! Wence."

1181
01:30:05,541 --> 01:30:11,485
LAURA: Wence, thank you so much. Could I grab
another of those fabulous five-gold drinks there,

1182
01:30:11,485 --> 01:30:13,198
that you brought to our friend?

1183
01:30:13,198 --> 01:30:17,674
MATT: "Oh, you want Schlond's Embrace. Okay. If
you're sure about that."

1184
01:30:17,674 --> 01:30:19,753
LAURA: I don't know, what is it?

1185
01:30:19,753 --> 01:30:28,284
MATT: "It's an acquired taste. It's made from a
very long-distilled, 40-year processing of a heavy

1186
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:36,697
"mint leaf, and that, when it's been very thickly
fermented, is mixed in with this very sour port

1187
01:30:36,697 --> 01:30:42,867
"base that's been repeatedly funneled and sifted
until it's become almost thick in its own right.

1188
01:30:42,867 --> 01:30:49,965
"That's mixed together with a few other sugars and a
bit of a special fruit. Honestly, I think it

1189
01:30:49,965 --> 01:30:52,881
"tastes pretty shitty, but it's what he likes."

1190
01:30:52,881 --> 01:30:54,323
LAURA: I'm going to give it a go.

1191
01:30:54,323 --> 01:31:00,996
MATT: "All right then! Five gold." He goes and
makes the drink for you again.

1192
01:31:00,996 --> 01:31:06,473
LAURA: Slowly but surely marking little amounts
off this party fund, y'all.

1193
01:31:06,473 --> 01:31:08,766
MARISHA: Need to make some more money.

1194
01:31:08,766 --> 01:31:15,053
MATT: However, he does not bring it in the same
glass. He brings it in a regular glass. You get

1195
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:27,863
the sense that the glass that was filled was his
own. But it's delivered and it's different. It

1196
01:31:27,863 --> 01:31:34,567
almost has a weird, mushroomy flavor to it. The
fermentations involved in the processing of this

1197
01:31:34,567 --> 01:31:42,621
is not the type of alcohol you'd expect. It's a
little musty. But it's functional, and it has an

1198
01:31:42,621 --> 01:31:46,417
aftertaste that comes to a very strong mint, like
a wintergreen afterwards.

1199
01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:48,964
It's a very strange mixture.

1200
01:31:48,964 --> 01:31:51,141
LAURA: It's like brushing your teeth, only you get
drunk.

1201
01:31:51,141 --> 01:31:56,038
MATT: Yeah, kind of. In fact, elements of it taste
like having orange juice

1202
01:31:56,038 --> 01:31:57,413
after brushing your teeth.

1203
01:31:57,413 --> 01:31:58,598
LAURA: Foul.

1204
01:31:58,598 --> 01:32:01,421
MATT: Yeah. It's a little rough at times.

1205
01:32:01,421 --> 01:32:06,207
MARISHA: What are you learning about the man by
what he drinks?

1206
01:32:06,207 --> 01:32:08,702
LAURA: I'm learning that he probably has minty
fresh breath.

1207
01:32:08,702 --> 01:32:09,865
MARISHA: Oh, really?

1208
01:32:09,865 --> 01:32:12,553
ASHLEY: Maybe you should cheers him from afar so
he can see you're drinking it.

1209
01:32:12,553 --> 01:32:14,551
LAURA: Yeah, but mine's in an ugly cup.

1210
01:32:14,551 --> 01:32:18,052
MARISHA: They didn't give you the same cup?

1211
01:32:18,052 --> 01:32:22,557
TRAVIS: I have nice cups. Do you want a
jewel-encrusted chalice?

1212
01:32:22,557 --> 01:32:23,700
LAURA: Do you have one?

1213
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:25,050
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1214
01:32:25,050 --> 01:32:26,382
LAURA: Pull it out.

1215
01:32:26,382 --> 01:32:29,961
TRAVIS: I'm like fucking Bed, Bath, and Beyond in
this bitch. Jewel-encrusted chalice.

1216
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:33,951
LAURA: Do you really have a jewel-encrusted-- you
do, in your fucking Bag of Holding?

1217
01:32:33,951 --> 01:32:35,987
TRAVIS: Not anymore, it's getting marked off now.

1218
01:32:35,987 --> 01:32:40,183
LAURA: Sweet. I'm going to clean that shit out,
pour it in.

1219
01:32:40,183 --> 01:32:43,301
TALIESIN: The interior of that bag looks like the
Pirates of the Caribbean ride.

1220
01:32:43,301 --> 01:32:45,362
It's a little weird in there.

1221
01:32:45,362 --> 01:32:54,893
MATT: It is a silver and pewter chalice that
contains a number of multi-colored gems embedded

1222
01:32:54,893 --> 01:32:57,098
along the sides, going to the base.

1223
01:32:57,098 --> 01:32:58,784
LAURA: This is gorgeous.

1224
01:32:58,784 --> 01:33:01,234
MATT: Lil' Jon would be proud. It's beautiful.

1225
01:33:01,234 --> 01:33:03,561
LAURA: Taryon. You drink out of this one.

1226
01:33:03,561 --> 01:33:05,146
SAM: That drink?

1227
01:33:05,146 --> 01:33:07,869
LAURA: Yeah, you're the one that bought him the
drink. Look like you're drinking it, too.

1228
01:33:07,869 --> 01:33:10,306
SAM: All right. Pinky out.

1229
01:33:10,306 --> 01:33:17,100
LAURA: How is it? Do you like it?

1230
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:19,299
SAM: I love it. (whispers) It's terrible.

1231
01:33:19,299 --> 01:33:20,597
LAURA: I know.

1232
01:33:20,597 --> 01:33:31,854
SAM: I'll just laugh, way too loud. (laughs) And
then she said to me, that's not armor!

1233
01:33:31,910 --> 01:33:39,225
MATT: Another 20 or so minutes pass in the
tavern.

1234
01:33:39,225 --> 01:33:45,488
MATT: Some folks have entered since then, some
have left. The patrons that are here don't seem to

1235
01:33:45,488 --> 01:33:49,798
be-- there isn't a lot of switching in and out.
Seems like most of the folks here come here fairly

1236
01:33:49,798 --> 01:33:56,062
often at the end of the day, whether to go about
their business or to unwind. But no one seems to

1237
01:33:56,062 --> 01:34:00,150
be approaching you, no one's crossing your path.

1238
01:34:00,150 --> 01:34:02,424
MARISHA: I'm so bored.

1239
01:34:02,424 --> 01:34:05,360
LAURA: Can I go over and talk to Wence one more
time?

1240
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:09,984
MATT: Sure. You catch his attention. He comes back
to the table as you step up and start in his

1241
01:34:09,984 --> 01:34:12,494
direction, he goes, "Hey. Another round, eh?"

1242
01:34:12,494 --> 01:34:18,265
LAURA: Actually, no. I give him five gold.

1243
01:34:18,265 --> 01:34:22,296
MATT: "All right. You want another one?"

1244
01:34:22,296 --> 01:34:30,352
LAURA: No, I'd rather not. No, I was just
wondering, do you know how long Korshad usually

1245
01:34:30,352 --> 01:34:32,637
hangs out here every night?

1246
01:34:32,637 --> 01:34:39,273
MATT: "Varies. Easily probably another hour or
so."

1247
01:34:39,273 --> 01:34:42,895
LAURA: Always with the same company, or different
people?

1248
01:34:42,895 --> 01:34:48,869
MATT: "Varies. They've been here most of the
afternoon."

1249
01:34:48,869 --> 01:34:59,844
LAURA: Oh, wow. Would you mind going over to him
and just letting him know that the gentleman who

1250
01:34:59,844 --> 01:35:04,705
bought him the drink would love a moment of his
time.

1251
01:35:04,705 --> 01:35:06,727
MATT: "Oh, all right."

1252
01:35:06,727 --> 01:35:09,481
LAURA: Taryon Darrington. He needs to know the
name.

1253
01:35:09,481 --> 01:35:18,834
MATT: "Okay. I will." He looks at the gold and
goes, "All right. I will."

1254
01:35:18,834 --> 01:35:22,967
LAURA: No rush. But make sure it happens.

1255
01:35:22,967 --> 01:35:30,094
MATT: You see he noticeably gets a little nervous.
Walks over. Do you go back to your table to join

1256
01:35:30,094 --> 01:35:36,176
your compatriots? Okay. As you're watching, he
actually has to psych himself up. He approaches

1257
01:35:36,176 --> 01:35:40,129
and then turns around and stops for a second, and
goes up to the table again and stops himself and

1258
01:35:40,129 --> 01:35:46,856
gets the gumption up this time and goes to the
table. And you see him talking to Korshad, who at

1259
01:35:46,856 --> 01:35:53,989
this point has his hand on the tip of the drink,
glances up at him. Looks over at the table again.

1260
01:35:53,989 --> 01:36:00,053
LAURA: I walk over and put my hand on Taryon's
shoulder and keep eye-contact with Korshad.

1261
01:36:00,053 --> 01:36:09,397
MATT: You see a smile creep slowly across
Korshad's face. Puts his hand up and immediately

1262
01:36:09,397 --> 01:36:13,278
you can watch as Wence, who's in the middle of
talking and expressing this goes, "Yes." And

1263
01:36:13,278 --> 01:36:18,582
quickly darts away. Korshad gives a point to the
rest of the guys and you watch his lips say,

1264
01:36:18,582 --> 01:36:21,868
"Excuse me a moment." He stands up.

1265
01:36:21,868 --> 01:36:24,926
SAM: Make some room. Grog, leave!

1266
01:36:24,926 --> 01:36:27,461
MARISHA: I scoot with Grog.

1267
01:36:27,461 --> 01:36:30,667
TRAVIS: We get up. I get up.

1268
01:36:30,667 --> 01:36:36,013
MARISHA: I get up with Grog, too. Oh, I have to
pee. Do you want to go pee?

1269
01:36:36,013 --> 01:36:41,787
MATT: As Korshad's walking across the room, Vax,
you do watch as all the individuals that are on

1270
01:36:41,787 --> 01:36:50,472
the upper platform all watch him go through the
room and are now seeing the table and where they

1271
01:36:50,472 --> 01:36:55,836
are standing. The attention is very strongly on
what is about to transpire.

1272
01:36:55,836 --> 01:36:57,527
LIAM: So far just eyes, though?

1273
01:36:57,527 --> 01:37:01,177
MARISHA: Yeah, I start paying attention to the
room as well, with Grog.

1274
01:37:01,177 --> 01:37:05,487
LIAM: Grand Poobah, here.

1275
01:37:05,487 --> 01:37:07,962
LAURA: You said that over the earring?

1276
01:37:07,962 --> 01:37:09,197
LIAM: That was Liam.

1277
01:37:09,197 --> 01:37:10,405
LAURA: Okay.

1278
01:37:10,405 --> 01:37:14,926
MATT: Korshad walks his way over to the table and
you can see, as he walks through, occasionally

1279
01:37:14,926 --> 01:37:21,909
somebody at a nearby table will stop and watch him
him. Very quickly to you, you get the sense that

1280
01:37:21,909 --> 01:37:24,984
he's definitely one of the more powerful figures
that seems to come in and out of this

1281
01:37:24,984 --> 01:37:31,318
establishment. He approaches the edge of the
table, still holding the cup from the upper lip.

1282
01:37:31,318 --> 01:37:35,304
There's like a lip at the very edge that he keeps
clasped with his fingers as it drifts there in

1283
01:37:35,304 --> 01:37:39,534
front of him, and he occasionally sips from it
that way as he walks towards you. Comes up to the

1284
01:37:39,534 --> 01:37:43,766
edge of the table. "Do you mind if I sit here?"

1285
01:37:43,766 --> 01:37:45,639
LAURA: Oh please, join us.

1286
01:37:45,639 --> 01:37:51,457
MATT: He sits down and places the cup on the
table. (muffled) "So."

1287
01:37:51,457 --> 01:37:57,427
(laughter)

1288
01:37:57,427 --> 01:38:01,201
MATT: "My man Wence tells me that you are
requesting my presence."

1289
01:38:01,201 --> 01:38:07,741
LAURA: Yes. For the sake of this. I'm going to
move my hands but just know my hands are here the

1290
01:38:07,805 --> 01:38:09,321
whole time. Okay?

1291
01:38:09,321 --> 01:38:10,273
MATT: Okay.

1292
01:38:10,273 --> 01:38:11,814
(laughter)

1293
01:38:11,814 --> 01:38:18,019
LAURA: I'm sure you're familiar with Taryon here.

1294
01:38:18,019 --> 01:38:21,778
SAM: Taryon Darrington, of the Darrington family.

1295
01:38:21,778 --> 01:38:23,795
MATT: I have not had the pleasure, but I know of
you.

1296
01:38:23,795 --> 01:38:27,865
LAURA: And you are familiar with his father as
well?

1297
01:38:27,865 --> 01:38:29,554
MATT: "Quite."

1298
01:38:29,554 --> 01:38:38,342
LAURA: We've heard tell of recent situations with
his family and you.

1299
01:38:38,342 --> 01:38:45,000
MATT: "And?"

1300
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:53,458
LAURA: And we were hoping we could come to an
agreement.

1301
01:38:53,458 --> 01:38:56,145
MATT: "What agreement do you have proposed?"

1302
01:38:56,145 --> 01:39:00,176
LAURA: Well, I don't know if you've heard of Vox
Machina?

1303
01:39:00,176 --> 01:39:12,735
MATT: "We trade in a great many things. Information
being one. And I am well aware of who you are."

1304
01:39:12,735 --> 01:39:20,013
LAURA: And I'm well aware that someone like you
could find a good use for someone like us.

1305
01:39:20,013 --> 01:39:22,084
MATT: "Are you offering your services?"

1306
01:39:22,084 --> 01:39:26,219
LAURA: Potentially. If it could help clear the
Darrington name.

1307
01:39:26,219 --> 01:39:40,325
MATT: (sighs) "You are not wrong. I, myself, am
the keeper of the deeds. I consider the Darrington

1308
01:39:40,325 --> 01:39:52,482
"estate a long-growing loan that is now ripening.
You see, our community here thrives on a principle

1309
01:39:52,482 --> 01:40:03,449
"that other syndicates in Exandria lack. Patience.
I have been letting this stew for a very, very

1310
01:40:03,449 --> 01:40:13,359
"long time, so if you wish to make any sort of dent
in this debt,

1311
01:40:13,359 --> 01:40:19,069
"your task will have to be equally monumental."

1312
01:40:19,069 --> 01:40:27,407
SAM: Well, I can make magical items, if there's
something that you need made or enchanted. We have

1313
01:40:27,407 --> 01:40:32,574
other members of the group that do different
things. We have a fine tinkerer, if you need

1314
01:40:32,574 --> 01:40:40,858
something made for you. Vex here is an excellent
shot. She could put on an archery show or

1315
01:40:40,858 --> 01:40:50,115
something, if that would be something worthwhile
to you. You know, if that will help ease the debt.

1316
01:40:50,115 --> 01:40:54,089
I know my family owes you quite a bit of money.

1317
01:40:54,089 --> 01:40:59,737
LAURA: 230,000 gold. If we're hearing correctly.

1318
01:40:59,737 --> 01:41:02,866
MATT: "You are correct. For the time being."

1319
01:41:02,866 --> 01:41:13,409
SAM: And might I inquire, as it is my family's
debt: what is the timetable on that? Will you be

1320
01:41:13,409 --> 01:41:17,195
coming to collect anytime soon?

1321
01:41:17,195 --> 01:41:29,873
MATT: "I have given your father a date of six
months to pay this debt. If it is not paid, then

1322
01:41:29,873 --> 01:41:39,023
"the deeds, as agreed upon many years ago,
transition to my name entirely. I am not going to

1323
01:41:39,023 --> 01:41:42,950
"kick your family to the street; I am not a
terrible man.

1324
01:41:42,950 --> 01:41:47,387
"But I will be possessing all of your belongings."

1325
01:41:47,387 --> 01:41:50,486
SAM: Will they be in any physical danger?

1326
01:41:50,486 --> 01:41:54,342
MATT: "No. Not unless they put up a fight."

1327
01:41:54,342 --> 01:42:05,314
SAM: Well, I don't know much about you, but I
assume you would much rather have the cash than have to

1328
01:42:05,355 --> 01:42:07,531
own property and manage it.

1329
01:42:07,531 --> 01:42:09,405
MATT: "Both have their uses."

1330
01:42:09,405 --> 01:42:11,638
SAM: All right.

1331
01:42:11,638 --> 01:42:15,326
LAURA: So would the Darringtons simply work for
you?

1332
01:42:15,326 --> 01:42:26,969
MATT: "The family, I will happily give them time to
find whatever place they can afford to live or

1333
01:42:26,969 --> 01:42:34,032
"leave the city entirely. It is not my business.
However, I will be taking over the farms, I will

1334
01:42:34,032 --> 01:42:40,325
"be taking over the business, I will be taking over
the estate. Most of the assets within, they will

1335
01:42:40,325 --> 01:42:43,098
"become property of the Myriad."

1336
01:42:43,098 --> 01:42:48,857
TALIESIN: Well, there. That's where I think we could
come to an arrangement. We're not particularly

1337
01:42:48,857 --> 01:42:58,867
invested in the power structure here. We're here
for sentimental reasons. The estate and just

1338
01:42:58,867 --> 01:43:05,274
enough property to maintain a modest
comfortability. We don't really care what happens

1339
01:43:05,274 --> 01:43:07,874
to the fortune so long as your family's taken
care of.

1340
01:43:07,874 --> 01:43:10,644
SAM: Yes, I guess.

1341
01:43:10,644 --> 01:43:13,895
TALIESIN: You keep your house, you keep your
things, you keep a little bit

1342
01:43:13,895 --> 01:43:16,216
of property to manage.

1343
01:43:16,216 --> 01:43:18,063
SAM: Sure.

1344
01:43:18,063 --> 01:43:31,932
TALIESIN: What do you think? I mean, they did make
this bed. I'm suggesting to you that maybe it is

1345
01:43:31,932 --> 01:43:38,061
not your job to save your family's power and allow
them to keep going as the way they have. But just

1346
01:43:38,061 --> 01:43:45,506
to give them enough that even if they-- that they
can continue with reasonable means. Maybe not

1347
01:43:45,506 --> 01:43:49,942
necessarily living the life that they were living
before but living far more comfortably.

1348
01:43:49,942 --> 01:43:55,169
SAM: Even that would be a step up, but it seems
like we would have to do something in order just

1349
01:43:55,169 --> 01:43:56,530
to earn that much.

1350
01:43:56,530 --> 01:44:01,237
TALIESIN: Oh, I imagine so. It's just, there's a
difference between saving everything and saving

1351
01:44:01,237 --> 01:44:03,397
enough to keep them comfortable.

1352
01:44:03,397 --> 01:44:10,617
MATT: "If I am to understand you correctly, you
are willing to offer your service to us?"

1353
01:44:10,617 --> 01:44:11,889
TALIESIN: Possibly.

1354
01:44:11,889 --> 01:44:21,011
MATT: "And in exchange, we would still be taking
the land-based assets from the Darrington name,

1355
01:44:21,011 --> 01:44:27,565
"other than the estate and enough means to live
comfortably."

1356
01:44:27,565 --> 01:44:34,944
TALIESIN: And enough income property for them to
be relatively comfortable. Reasonably comfortable.

1357
01:44:34,944 --> 01:44:39,911
I'm sure we can take a look at the assets and come
to a very, very reasonable arrangement. And you,

1358
01:44:39,911 --> 01:44:45,355
in turn-- well, we could have a discussion about
what that would be worth to you. I have no

1359
01:44:45,355 --> 01:44:50,930
interest in making an arrangement that doesn't
please you. We're only here, again, for

1360
01:44:50,930 --> 01:44:54,130
sentimental reasons. We are not invested beyond
that.

1361
01:44:54,130 --> 01:44:56,882
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1362
01:44:56,882 --> 01:45:03,216
TALIESIN: Please, god. You've been terrible today.
15.

1363
01:45:03,216 --> 01:45:15,238
MATT: He goes, "Comfortable living is a relative
thing. To maintain my comfort of living, well,

1364
01:45:15,238 --> 01:45:22,215
"your estate is but a drop in the bucket. But, and
I mean no offense--" as he looks about the rest of

1365
01:45:22,215 --> 01:45:29,916
you-- "Comfortable living for some of you, well,
that could be as much as my drink would cost."

1366
01:45:29,916 --> 01:45:41,489
SAM: My family would require their main property
and all residential rental property.

1367
01:45:41,489 --> 01:45:48,486
MATT: "That is not a deal. The residential and the
farm territory is to become mine. I would leave

1368
01:45:48,486 --> 01:45:59,438
"for them your estate and enough gold to live a
comparably comfortable lifestyle than living on

1369
01:45:59,438 --> 01:46:05,120
"the street for years to come. They could then
strike out on their own, start a new fortune if

1370
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:10,483
"they wish. Perhaps land barony was not their
strong suit. You seem to have found other

1371
01:46:10,483 --> 01:46:14,031
"pursuits, maybe you could lead them in a new
path."

1372
01:46:14,031 --> 01:46:17,391
LAURA: And past that point, they would be in no
debt to you?

1373
01:46:17,391 --> 01:46:25,962
MATT: "Past that point, and a task done in our
favor by the famed Vox Machina. Maybe."

1374
01:46:25,962 --> 01:46:38,439
SAM: Would they get to maintain possession of
their personal property? Artwork, statues?

1375
01:46:38,439 --> 01:46:44,494
MATT: "Everything that remains within the estate
home itself would be yours to keep.

1376
01:46:44,494 --> 01:46:49,182
"The rest is mine."

1377
01:46:49,182 --> 01:46:51,678
SAM: And what is this task?

1378
01:46:51,678 --> 01:47:03,837
MATT: "Roughly 120 miles east of here lies a
sinkhole. It has swallowed the core of the

1379
01:47:03,837 --> 01:47:13,070
"platinum mines of Herethis a few months back. Now,
those mines are a very lucrative point of business

1380
01:47:13,070 --> 01:47:23,094
"for my employers. And every time we've sent scouts
to inspect the source of this erosion, none have

1381
01:47:23,094 --> 01:47:34,754
"returned. Many very capable and proven men,
unheard again. One of our greatest diviners has

1382
01:47:34,754 --> 01:47:49,230
"since spoken of a powerful force within this mine.
Ancient. Birthed improperly. But now seems to grow

1383
01:47:49,230 --> 01:47:57,998
"more and more mad. We're at a loss, so we've put
out a contract or two, but nothing has taken a

1384
01:47:57,998 --> 01:48:10,019
"bite yet. If you were to go to this mine, find
this entity that has ruined our mining operation

1385
01:48:10,019 --> 01:48:15,249
"there, return with proof of its demise, and we
confirm its destruction,

1386
01:48:15,249 --> 01:48:19,169
"I will consider our task complete."

1387
01:48:19,169 --> 01:48:29,840
TALIESIN: We'll also need some operating capital
for this. It sounds dangerous, so we will take the

1388
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:38,404
job, but we will need to also charge a very
reasonable fee, I think, on top of this.

1389
01:48:38,404 --> 01:48:42,973
MATT: "That is entirely understood. And we will
keep track of each fee, and we will deduct it from

1390
01:48:42,973 --> 01:48:46,741
"the materials in the Darrington estate."

1391
01:48:46,741 --> 01:48:53,976
LAURA: If we take care of this for you, it does
seem like a monumental task.

1392
01:48:53,976 --> 01:49:01,070
MATT: "It may not be. But it would seem to be
something of your skill set."

1393
01:49:01,070 --> 01:49:11,215
LAURA: From what we've learned, ancient beings
tend to be quite powerful. We would ask that you

1394
01:49:11,215 --> 01:49:23,009
don't slander the Darrington name. That when they
stay in their estate, everyone believes they are

1395
01:49:23,009 --> 01:49:26,650
still the Darringtons as they have always been.

1396
01:49:26,650 --> 01:49:33,543
MATT: "I would agree to that. I have no interests
in your family's public image. I believe that

1397
01:49:33,543 --> 01:49:37,021
"damage has been done well enough on your own."

1398
01:49:37,021 --> 01:49:41,202
SAM: Yes. Are you sure you don't have a cloak I
could just enchant

1399
01:49:41,202 --> 01:49:43,478
and then we could call it square?

1400
01:49:43,478 --> 01:49:50,632
MATT: (chuckling) He takes another sip from his
drink. "When all this is said and done, Taryon,

1401
01:49:50,632 --> 01:49:55,998
"we'll be in contact. I think there is much
business we could do in the future."

1402
01:49:55,998 --> 01:50:01,451
SAM: All right. I suppose we have no choice.

1403
01:50:01,451 --> 01:50:02,928
TALIESIN: We do.

1404
01:50:02,928 --> 01:50:05,128
LAURA: There's always a choice, dear.

1405
01:50:05,128 --> 01:50:08,981
MARISHA: You could marry the girl or we could go
kill an ancient being.

1406
01:50:08,981 --> 01:50:11,334
TALIESIN: I'm feeling pretty good about this one.

1407
01:50:11,334 --> 01:50:12,331
MARISHA: Yeah!

1408
01:50:12,331 --> 01:50:14,373
SAM: All right.

1409
01:50:14,373 --> 01:50:21,943
LAURA: Do we need to decide at this moment?

1410
01:50:21,943 --> 01:50:24,143
SAM: Seems like we do.

1411
01:50:24,143 --> 01:50:28,139
TALIESIN: We will also need all of the information
you have on this creature in the mines, and

1412
01:50:28,139 --> 01:50:30,721
if you have anybody who has access to that--

1413
01:50:30,721 --> 01:50:33,287
LAURA: The diviner would be wonderful to speak
to.

1414
01:50:33,287 --> 01:50:36,389
MATT: "The information I have given you is
what the diviner has found."

1415
01:50:36,432 --> 01:50:45,828
SAM: I'm not going to ask you all to risk your
lives for my shitty family, so I will pursue this

1416
01:50:45,828 --> 01:50:47,931
matter on my own if I have to.

1417
01:50:47,931 --> 01:50:49,611
LAURA: Good. Yeah. You're going to go by
yourself.

1418
01:50:49,611 --> 01:50:55,802
SAM: Well, I would hire a couple of people to come
with me, but if you'd like to accompany me, I'd be

1419
01:50:55,802 --> 01:50:57,729
okay with that too.

1420
01:50:57,729 --> 01:51:00,150
TRAVIS: We could watch you do it. That'd be pretty
funny.

1421
01:51:00,150 --> 01:51:04,663
SAM: Well, I mean, you've taught me a lot, so
maybe I could do it.

1422
01:51:04,663 --> 01:51:06,433
LAURA: I think you're good.

1423
01:51:06,433 --> 01:51:10,381
ASHLEY: You won't find anybody as good as us.

1424
01:51:10,381 --> 01:51:11,849
SAM: Of course not.

1425
01:51:11,849 --> 01:51:17,625
MARISHA: You are very skilled in hiring talented
mercenaries. That might be your strongest suit.

1426
01:51:17,625 --> 01:51:20,619
SAM: I am one for two on that count.

1427
01:51:20,619 --> 01:51:25,472
TALIESIN: And we do have another mercenary at our
beck, if we need. That's actually very fair.

1428
01:51:25,472 --> 01:51:27,202
You're already one up.

1429
01:51:27,202 --> 01:51:31,346
SAM: Should we vote on it then? Grog, do you want
to go kill something big and scary?

1430
01:51:31,346 --> 01:51:32,348
TRAVIS: Yes.

1431
01:51:32,348 --> 01:51:34,738
SAM: Pike, are you drunk?

1432
01:51:34,738 --> 01:51:46,537
ASHLEY: I think you should marry whoever you want.
So that's what I think we should do. Yes. Yea. I

1433
01:51:46,537 --> 01:51:47,926
vote yea.

1434
01:51:47,926 --> 01:51:49,005
SAM: Twinsies?

1435
01:51:49,015 --> 01:51:50,605
LAURA: Always have your back, dear.

1436
01:51:50,605 --> 01:52:00,415
SAM: Oh, Vax isn't here. Hey Vax. You want to go
help me save my family by risking our lives in

1437
01:52:00,485 --> 01:52:02,531
almost certain death?

1438
01:52:02,531 --> 01:52:04,803
LIAM: What does that entail?

1439
01:52:04,803 --> 01:52:07,826
SAM: I'll take that as a yes. Keyleth?

1440
01:52:07,826 --> 01:52:12,178
MARISHA: Vax says yes, and so do I! Aye!

1441
01:52:12,178 --> 01:52:14,772
SAM: Science bro?

1442
01:52:14,772 --> 01:52:19,984
TALIESIN: Vex says yes, and I am so in the mood to
kill something.

1443
01:52:19,984 --> 01:52:23,061
(laughter)

1444
01:52:23,061 --> 01:52:28,866
MARISHA: I think we've all risked our lives for each
other at one point and another, so it's your turn,

1445
01:52:28,929 --> 01:52:31,372
Tary. Welcome to the family.

1446
01:52:31,372 --> 01:52:34,461
TALIESIN: Cheers. This stuff burns.

1447
01:52:34,461 --> 01:52:42,332
MATT: And this whole conversation he's had his
mouth covered, he takes his fingers away from his

1448
01:52:42,332 --> 01:52:53,029
mouth and he takes the drink. "Do we have an
accord?" Picks his drink up and clinks it. "Return

1449
01:52:53,029 --> 01:52:57,289
"when the deed is done." Slaps the table and stands
up and walks back. And at this point, that you

1450
01:52:57,289 --> 01:53:06,467
notice, the tables nearby, everyone's been just
quietly watching in on this. As soon as he leaves

1451
01:53:06,617 --> 01:53:09,408
they go back to their business and drinking.

1452
01:53:09,408 --> 01:53:13,412
TALIESIN: Everyone, on the count of three, we're
going to stand up very quickly.

1453
01:53:13,412 --> 01:53:14,884
MARISHA: Okay.

1454
01:53:14,884 --> 01:53:18,574
SAM: Why? Okay.

1455
01:53:18,574 --> 01:53:20,862
LIAM: Wait! No, I'm just fucking with you.

1456
01:53:20,862 --> 01:53:22,643
LAURA: Three! Let's go!

1457
01:53:22,643 --> 01:53:30,671
MATT: As you do that, about half the folks get
startled by it. The music's still going.

1458
01:53:30,671 --> 01:53:35,058
LAURA: On the way out, can I grab Wence again, one
last time?

1459
01:53:35,058 --> 01:53:37,017
MATT: "Hey."

1460
01:53:37,017 --> 01:53:40,779
LAURA: Most of the people here, are they local
patrons or do they come from all over?

1461
01:53:40,779 --> 01:53:48,734
MATT: "Most of them are local and come from all
over."

1462
01:53:48,734 --> 01:53:50,705
LAURA: Great. Thank you.

1463
01:53:50,705 --> 01:53:52,073
MATT: "Sorry."

1464
01:53:52,073 --> 01:53:53,688
LAURA: It's all I needed.

1465
01:53:53,688 --> 01:53:55,498
MATT: "I just serve the drinks, miss."

1466
01:53:55,498 --> 01:53:59,173
TRAVIS: Can I make my way back over to the
players?

1467
01:53:59,173 --> 01:54:03,517
MATT: Okay. She's sitting there. (drumming)

1468
01:54:03,517 --> 01:54:06,624
TRAVIS: Can I have your name?

1469
01:54:06,624 --> 01:54:10,242
MATT: (drumming)

1470
01:54:10,242 --> 01:54:14,517
TRAVIS: (louder) Can I have your name?

1471
01:54:14,517 --> 01:54:22,149
MATT: As she's still drumming her head slowly
turns around and she goes, "Camilla." (drumming)

1472
01:54:22,149 --> 01:54:24,633
TRAVIS: Thank you, and I leave.

1473
01:54:24,633 --> 01:54:31,363
MATT: (laughs) All right. With that, we're going
to take a break. Try and get back here in a minute

1474
01:54:31,363 --> 01:54:34,612
guys, see this next bit of interesting fun.

1475
01:54:34,612 --> 01:54:36,127
MARISHA: To Camilla!

1476
01:54:36,127 --> 01:54:44,911
MATT: All right guys, so we have tonight's Wyrmwood
giveaway: this awesome butternut wood and leather

1477
01:54:44,911 --> 01:54:53,672
dice tray. Giveaway from our friends at Wyrmwood.
Come on over, jump into the Twitch chat to

1478
01:54:53,672 --> 01:55:00,324
enter for the possibility to win this, the word
for the night is Myriad. That is M-Y-R-I-A-D. If

1479
01:55:00,324 --> 01:55:02,096
you don't know, look it up on Google.

1480
01:55:02,096 --> 01:55:03,923
MARISHA: You'll win it if you spell it right.

1481
01:55:03,923 --> 01:55:09,566
MATT: Exactly. Butternut up or shut up with your
Myriad spelling. All right guys, be back here in a

1482
01:55:09,612 --> 01:55:12,002
few minutes. See you in a second.

1483
01:55:12,002 --> 02:12:12,940
[break]

1484
02:12:13,002 --> 02:12:17,223
MATT: Hello, everyone. Welcome back to Critical
Role. Which, timing works out interesting

1485
02:12:17,223 --> 02:12:21,859
sometimes. Yeah, welcome back to the game. We had
our break. Going to go ahead and jump in here.

1486
02:12:21,859 --> 02:12:25,359
LIAM: I feel cheated. I didn't hear any of that.

1487
02:12:25,359 --> 02:12:26,424
SAM: (belches)

1488
02:12:26,424 --> 02:12:27,473
LAURA: Nice.

1489
02:12:27,473 --> 02:12:28,518
SAM: Thanks.

1490
02:12:28,518 --> 02:12:35,980
MATT: As you guys have found your way out of what
seems to be this strange subterranean bar beneath

1491
02:12:35,980 --> 02:12:46,640
the Grumpy Lily, you've agreed to, at least for
the time being, to make your way east to this

1492
02:12:46,640 --> 02:12:54,795
mine, which currently seems to be under the--
what's it called? The Platinum Mines of

1493
02:12:54,795 --> 02:13:04,162
Herethis. Herethis. Which you, Taryon, you
understand. Herethis is a region, a regional

1494
02:13:04,162 --> 02:13:12,104
forest area over there. The Herethis Wood. About
120 miles east. You guys decide: What's your best

1495
02:13:12,104 --> 02:13:15,230
means of travel? How do you intend to get there?

1496
02:13:15,230 --> 02:13:20,965
SAM: We have to misty there, right? Because you
don't know any trees in the area?

1497
02:13:20,965 --> 02:13:24,420
MARISHA: I could scry on the area if I knew enough
about it.

1498
02:13:24,420 --> 02:13:27,690
TALIESIN: If we misty there we could also camp for
the night.

1499
02:13:27,690 --> 02:13:30,830
LAURA: Yeah, we need to camp because we need to
rest and get our shit back.

1500
02:13:30,830 --> 02:13:33,180
MARISHA: That's fine. It's 120 miles.

1501
02:13:33,180 --> 02:13:37,365
MATT: It's not terribly far, as the mist flies.

1502
02:13:37,427 --> 02:13:40,599
MARISHA: Yep. I'm pretty fresh.

1503
02:13:40,641 --> 02:13:44,660
TALIESIN: We can misty there, camp for the night.

1504
02:13:44,660 --> 02:13:47,222
TRAVIS: (repeatedly, getting deeper) Yeah.

1505
02:13:47,222 --> 02:13:49,025
(laughter)

1506
02:13:49,025 --> 02:13:50,565
TRAVIS: Character voice.

1507
02:13:50,565 --> 02:13:52,706
MATT: Well, I'll go ahead and by the way, because
I totally forgot. We do have a winner in the

1508
02:13:52,706 --> 02:13:58,898
chatroom. Besolis8926, you won the giveaway.

1509
02:13:58,898 --> 02:14:01,532
LIAM: You got the Nutter Butter box!

1510
02:14:01,532 --> 02:14:05,713
MATT: Yeah, Denova will contact you for your
information to get it shipped to you, so

1511
02:14:05,713 --> 02:14:10,896
congratulations. All right, so. What are you
thinking about for travel? You're just doing the

1512
02:14:10,896 --> 02:14:12,933
Wind Walk?

1513
02:14:12,933 --> 02:14:17,970
MARISHA: All right, before we leave, is there any
type of research we should potentially do?

1514
02:14:17,970 --> 02:14:19,346
TRAVIS: Nope. Headlong.

1515
02:14:19,346 --> 02:14:21,599
(laughter)

1516
02:14:21,599 --> 02:14:25,691
SAM: I don't know what we'd be researching. The
guy who sent us on the mission doesn't even know

1517
02:14:25,691 --> 02:14:26,695
what it is.

1518
02:14:26,695 --> 02:14:30,854
LIAM: It's not even nearby, so it's not like we
could ask people what the mine is like. It's 120

1519
02:14:30,854 --> 02:14:31,960
miles away.

1520
02:14:31,960 --> 02:14:33,003
TRAVIS: Yep.

1521
02:14:33,003 --> 02:14:34,555
LIAM: The mines of "hear this."

1522
02:14:34,555 --> 02:14:36,068
LAURA: Herethis.

1523
02:14:36,068 --> 02:14:38,806
TRAVIS: This is right up our alley. Like this is
literally what we've

1524
02:14:38,806 --> 02:14:40,295
been training for our whole lives.

1525
02:14:40,295 --> 02:14:44,093
MARISHA: I mean, just in case there's maybe some
ancient deity that rules over the forest of

1526
02:14:44,093 --> 02:14:49,340
Herethis and some sort of goddess? Fuck it, let's
go.

1527
02:14:49,340 --> 02:14:52,759
LAURA: I mean, do we know anything? Have we ever
heard about the woods of Herethis or the Platinum

1528
02:14:52,759 --> 02:14:54,186
Mines of Herethis?

1529
02:14:54,186 --> 02:15:00,048
MATT: You guys haven't. You have. They're woods
that lead into this small rocky-- it's almost too

1530
02:15:00,048 --> 02:15:05,352
small to be a mountain range and more just large,
rocky hills. But there's no historical

1531
02:15:05,352 --> 02:15:12,026
significance to the location that you know of. Go
ahead and make a history check.

1532
02:15:12,026 --> 02:15:13,657
TRAVIS: Roll high.

1533
02:15:13,657 --> 02:15:15,702
TALIESIN: That'll do.

1534
02:15:15,702 --> 02:15:18,278
SAM: Oh yeah! 21.

1535
02:15:18,278 --> 02:15:29,932
MATT: 21. You do know a number of the large-scale
battles that took place towards the end of the Age

1536
02:15:29,932 --> 02:15:36,964
of Arcanum took place on Wildmount. In fact,
Zorhaus, the other kingdom that we were discussing

1537
02:15:36,964 --> 02:15:45,186
before is largely a badlands, barren landscape
because that was where the final battle between

1538
02:15:45,186 --> 02:15:53,325
the Betrayer Gods and the Prime Deities took
place. And the sheer volume of, the sheer

1539
02:15:53,325 --> 02:15:59,778
intensity of that battle laid waste to the
landscape there, so you have the Dwendalian Empire

1540
02:15:59,778 --> 02:16:07,328
and the whole western side of Wildmount, which is
fairly lush and functional, then towards the

1541
02:16:07,328 --> 02:16:12,295
Zorhaus Kingdom is, and that whole eastern side of
the continent, a lot of it is just barren,

1542
02:16:12,295 --> 02:16:24,732
cracked, destroyed. But you do know that Herethis,
the name, at least, stems from a hero that fell in

1543
02:16:24,732 --> 02:16:33,260
a battle long ago. You can't recall the specific
details of it, but there is some significance to

1544
02:16:33,260 --> 02:16:37,275
the title or at least the location there to
something ancient and old. May have to deal with

1545
02:16:37,275 --> 02:16:46,761
this time period of entities battling gods. That's
the best you can make out. The mines are well

1546
02:16:46,761 --> 02:16:52,704
known. The Platinum Mines are well known. They're
not well attended. They're not a public space, and

1547
02:16:52,704 --> 02:17:01,181
they're definitely under the control of a number
of companies that are shadow corporations under

1548
02:17:01,181 --> 02:17:06,287
the control of the Myriad. You can see where the
connection and the necessity for it to be reopened

1549
02:17:06,287 --> 02:17:11,847
again is important. Platinum is not a very common
metal.

1550
02:17:11,847 --> 02:17:16,860
TRAVIS: Anything we should be worried about?

1551
02:17:16,860 --> 02:17:19,051
SAM: Gods attacking us.

1552
02:17:19,051 --> 02:17:20,262
TRAVIS: Nope.

1553
02:17:20,262 --> 02:17:22,329
MARISHA: Trial run.

1554
02:17:22,329 --> 02:17:29,086
LAURA: Oh man. No, but really, that's where the
battles took place, huh? So this ancient being

1555
02:17:29,086 --> 02:17:31,336
could be from, potentially--

1556
02:17:31,336 --> 02:17:32,614
SAM: Or it could not.

1557
02:17:32,614 --> 02:17:35,383
TALIESIN: Whatever it is, it's not leaving the
mine.

1558
02:17:35,383 --> 02:17:40,879
LIAM: We're running off on a lark, but we've raked
ourselves in the faces before.

1559
02:17:40,879 --> 02:17:42,889
LAURA: Yeah! If we die, we die.

1560
02:17:42,889 --> 02:17:44,737
SAM: Oh god, I don't want to die.

1561
02:17:44,737 --> 02:17:46,538
TALIESIN: Well, no one wants to die.

1562
02:17:46,538 --> 02:17:48,146
MARISHA: Well, once again--

1563
02:17:48,146 --> 02:17:51,995
LAURA: Don't say it, Keyleth. Do not fucking say
it.

1564
02:17:51,995 --> 02:17:54,721
TRAVIS: Don't incant that shit again.

1565
02:17:54,721 --> 02:17:57,802
LAURA: Don't say it about all of us and doom us to
your fate.

1566
02:17:57,802 --> 02:17:59,360
TRAVIS: Goldfish.

1567
02:17:59,360 --> 02:18:00,501
MARISHA: Duty.

1568
02:18:00,501 --> 02:18:02,602
(laughter)

1569
02:18:02,602 --> 02:18:03,708
TRAVIS: Better.

1570
02:18:03,708 --> 02:18:10,712
SAM: Before we go, was there something you wanted
to tell the drow woman?

1571
02:18:10,712 --> 02:18:14,806
LAURA: Oh shit.

1572
02:18:14,806 --> 02:18:24,292
LIAM: If we're talking about what we were talking
about before, I don't think it's a good idea.

1573
02:18:24,292 --> 02:18:26,604
TRAVIS: Why?

1574
02:18:26,604 --> 02:18:38,004
LIAM: If you want to go and find him, us, and say hi,
that's a different story.

1575
02:18:38,004 --> 02:18:45,315
LAURA: I would like to point out that this same
person you are so adamantly protecting from our

1576
02:18:45,315 --> 02:18:51,214
scrying or our spying or our finding is the same
person who shit in the middle of a temple so that

1577
02:18:51,214 --> 02:18:52,803
he could watch Pike.

1578
02:18:52,803 --> 02:18:58,190
LIAM: Well, A) he did that, not us, and B) we were
all very much friends and happy with each other

1579
02:18:58,190 --> 02:19:07,334
when he did that, and he is not happy with us.
It's not exactly the same thing, dear. But if you

1580
02:19:07,334 --> 02:19:14,044
want to go with me and find him and check
in and say hello, I'd be very happy to do that

1581
02:19:14,044 --> 02:19:22,148
with you. But to send the woman who threw our
friend, drugged, over the back of a horse, and

1582
02:19:22,148 --> 02:19:29,096
took him off to his family? I don't really want to
send her after Scanlan, to look in on him or

1583
02:19:29,096 --> 02:19:35,440
follow him or watch him or anything him. It didn't
sound like his father wanted him dragged back on

1584
02:19:35,440 --> 02:19:39,324
the back of a horse, and it happened anyway. She
doesn't seem very trustworthy to me. Yeah, she's

1585
02:19:39,324 --> 02:19:40,950
cool. So what?

1586
02:19:40,950 --> 02:19:49,576
LAURA: I just realized I have the other half of
the stone. The traveling stone.

1587
02:19:49,576 --> 02:19:52,465
MARISHA: That we gave Scanlan.

1588
02:19:52,465 --> 02:19:55,105
LAURA: I could pop in on him anytime I want.

1589
02:19:55,105 --> 02:19:57,094
TALIESIN: Or he could pop in on you anytime.

1590
02:19:57,094 --> 02:19:58,585
MARISHA: But he hasn't.

1591
02:19:58,585 --> 02:20:00,052
TRAVIS: If he has it, still.

1592
02:20:00,052 --> 02:20:02,969
MARISHA: Yeah, maybe he threw it into the ocean
for all we know.

1593
02:20:02,969 --> 02:20:05,441
TRAVIS: Ooh, that would suck because then we'd be
in the ocean.

1594
02:20:05,441 --> 02:20:08,262
LAURA: That would be really, really shit if he did
that.

1595
02:20:08,262 --> 02:20:10,413
MARISHA: It would be a massively dickish move.

1596
02:20:10,413 --> 02:20:12,070
LIAM: That was very smart, Grog.

1597
02:20:12,070 --> 02:20:14,009
TRAVIS: Hey.

1598
02:20:14,009 --> 02:20:17,155
TALIESIN: Wow, that happened.

1599
02:20:17,155 --> 02:20:19,833
TRAVIS: In your face.

1600
02:20:19,833 --> 02:20:26,949
LIAM: Oh. Anyway, my point still stands. Once we
wrap up here if you want to go

1601
02:20:26,949 --> 02:20:28,614
find him I will go with you.

1602
02:20:28,614 --> 02:20:32,561
MARISHA: And do what? Convince him to come back?

1603
02:20:32,561 --> 02:20:33,865
LIAM: No.

1604
02:20:33,865 --> 02:20:36,130
MARISHA: See if he's okay? Ask him how his year's
been?

1605
02:20:36,130 --> 02:20:37,741
LIAM: Yeah.

1606
02:20:37,741 --> 02:20:46,042
TRAVIS: What about just a location and she has to
stay unseen? You know, I know Keyleth can scry and

1607
02:20:46,042 --> 02:20:47,107
stuff but--

1608
02:20:47,107 --> 02:20:49,819
TALIESIN: We could make her walk first into the
mines.

1609
02:20:49,819 --> 02:20:54,467
MARISHA: Yeah, you didn't want me to even scry on
him and now we're talking about just popping in on

1610
02:20:54,467 --> 02:20:57,851
him? I feel like there's a weird crossing of the
lines.

1611
02:20:57,851 --> 02:21:00,441
TRAVIS: Yeah, but that was a year ago. I'm over that
sentiment.

1612
02:21:00,490 --> 02:21:02,447
MARISHA: Oh man, Grog.

1613
02:21:02,447 --> 02:21:03,907
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yep.

1614
02:21:03,907 --> 02:21:08,443
MARISHA: You guilted me very hard on that. You
made me feel kind of shitty.

1615
02:21:08,443 --> 02:21:10,591
TRAVIS: This is Grog evolved.

1616
02:21:10,591 --> 02:21:15,766
MARISHA: No, you kind of got it right. Just go
with it.

1617
02:21:15,766 --> 02:21:17,480
TALIESIN and LAURA: Exalted?

1618
02:21:17,480 --> 02:21:19,733
TRAVIS: Absorbed. Yep.

1619
02:21:19,733 --> 02:21:21,484
LIAM: You done been woked.

1620
02:21:21,484 --> 02:21:23,093
TRAVIS: Woked.

1621
02:21:23,093 --> 02:21:27,373
LIAM: So woked.

1622
02:21:27,373 --> 02:21:35,129
LAURA: No, but seriously. What are we doing? I
don't think we use that mercenary to walk into a

1623
02:21:35,129 --> 02:21:37,840
mine. I'm not sending her to her death.

1624
02:21:37,840 --> 02:21:41,800
TALIESIN: I am perfectly content to hold onto that
chit for as long as we need.

1625
02:21:41,800 --> 02:21:46,215
LIAM: Save that for a rainy day. We don't need to
punch that ticket now.

1626
02:21:46,215 --> 02:21:51,890
SAM: Should we at least ask her to stay in town?
For a to-be-determined mission later?

1627
02:21:51,890 --> 02:21:54,464
TRAVIS: Well, I think she needs to keep up her
employment, right?

1628
02:21:54,464 --> 02:21:58,960
SAM: We can give her a little money to keep
around, a retainer.

1629
02:21:58,960 --> 02:22:01,736
LAURA: No.

1630
02:22:01,736 --> 02:22:04,643
SAM: I can give her a little money. I might need
her.

1631
02:22:04,643 --> 02:22:09,704
TALIESIN: She was employed. She's reachable
through employment. We can just find out how to

1632
02:22:09,704 --> 02:22:10,688
reach her.

1633
02:22:10,688 --> 02:22:12,232
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, that one!

1634
02:22:12,232 --> 02:22:13,545
SAM: She might be gone.

1635
02:22:13,545 --> 02:22:18,296
TALIESIN: You have to be able to hire her. I'm
sure there's a system.

1636
02:22:18,296 --> 02:22:23,171
SAM: We have no idea how she was hired in the
first place.

1637
02:22:23,171 --> 02:22:24,898
LAURA: We go ask her how to hire her.

1638
02:22:24,898 --> 02:22:26,790
SAM: All right, well then let's do that.

1639
02:22:26,790 --> 02:22:30,346
MARISHA: And no one has heard from him at all over
the course of the year?

1640
02:22:30,346 --> 02:22:31,305
TRAVIS: Who?

1641
02:22:31,305 --> 02:22:33,551
LAURA: Oh. Well, he writes me all the time, but
outside of that.

1642
02:22:33,551 --> 02:22:36,486
TRAVIS: What? Really?! Scanlan does?!

1643
02:22:36,486 --> 02:22:37,940
MARISHA: She's messing with you.

1644
02:22:37,940 --> 02:22:41,547
TRAVIS: That was very mean.

1645
02:22:41,547 --> 02:22:44,512
TALIESIN: You promised you'd keep that secret.

1646
02:22:44,512 --> 02:22:46,220
LIAM: She has a mean streak.

1647
02:22:46,220 --> 02:22:50,202
LAURA: (laughs) I have so many secrets to keep,
dear. So many.

1648
02:22:50,202 --> 02:22:55,999
TRAVIS: I'm mad for an (stutters) a long time.

1649
02:22:55,999 --> 02:22:59,652
LIAM: I know one of them. When she farts it sounds
like a duck.

1650
02:22:59,652 --> 02:23:01,586
LAURA: It really does.

1651
02:23:01,586 --> 02:23:03,031
MARISHA: That's kind of cute.

1652
02:23:03,031 --> 02:23:06,940
LAURA: We go find-- (laughs)

1653
02:23:06,940 --> 02:23:11,527
TALIESIN: You're going to fart awkwardly and we're
going to yell "imposter!"

1654
02:23:11,527 --> 02:23:19,025
MATT: All right, so you find K'rynn. She let you know
that she was just around the corner from where the

1655
02:23:19,310 --> 02:23:28,826
estate was and let you know where to find her, and
it's like an open tent/lounge area. She's just

1656
02:23:28,987 --> 02:23:33,082
currently drinking water and eating a little bit
of dried meat, and as you approach, she stands up.

1657
02:23:33,082 --> 02:23:37,497
She still has her illusion on. She still has her
pale skin. You get the sense that drow in general

1658
02:23:37,497 --> 02:23:42,927
are not-- they don't have the easiest time walking
through large societal establishments.

1659
02:23:42,927 --> 02:23:48,721
"You returned. So what did you need?"

1660
02:23:48,721 --> 02:23:56,619
SAM: We have no mission at this moment, but we may
call on you shortly after we return.

1661
02:23:56,619 --> 02:23:58,286
MATT: "Very well."

1662
02:23:58,286 --> 02:24:00,911
SAM: Can we find you here or will you be gone?

1663
02:24:00,911 --> 02:24:03,400
MATT: "I have no interest in staying in this city
in particular.

1664
02:24:03,400 --> 02:24:06,639
"I generally prefer to stay around Vashlow."

1665
02:24:06,639 --> 02:24:08,590
SAM: Where's that?

1666
02:24:08,590 --> 02:24:14,673
MATT: "Vashlow? It's to the west of here. About 25
miles southeast of Port Demali."

1667
02:24:14,673 --> 02:24:17,048
TRAVIS: Port Demali.

1668
02:24:17,048 --> 02:24:22,959
MATT: "If you wish to contact me, you can send a
missive to Vashlow, or if you have access to a

1669
02:24:22,959 --> 02:24:27,903
"practitioner of the arcane arts, perhaps a Sending
would be sufficient."

1670
02:24:27,903 --> 02:24:29,424
SAM: Sending, okay.

1671
02:24:29,424 --> 02:24:30,743
LAURA: Definitely.

1672
02:24:30,743 --> 02:24:43,667
SAM: All right. Well, stand by. We'll call you.
Thank you for your time, and we'll be in touch.

1673
02:24:43,667 --> 02:24:48,968
MATT: "Very well. It was just business."

1674
02:24:48,968 --> 02:24:51,340
SAM: Sorry about your horse.

1675
02:24:51,340 --> 02:24:59,490
MATT: "Eh. Fair trade." She gets up and gathers
her little satchel over the side of her shoulder.

1676
02:24:59,490 --> 02:25:05,879
"Until we meet again." She nods and then walks out
into the darkness of the night.

1677
02:25:05,879 --> 02:25:10,895
LAURA: Never to be heard from again because we'll
forget that we have that connection.

1678
02:25:10,895 --> 02:25:12,565
(laughter)

1679
02:25:12,565 --> 02:25:19,427
MATT: All right, so what are you guys doing?

1680
02:25:19,427 --> 02:25:23,838
SAM: Let's Misty Step. Let's Wind Walk.

1681
02:25:23,838 --> 02:25:26,770
LAURA: Misty Step tonight and then that way we can
recover everything?

1682
02:25:26,770 --> 02:25:28,021
TALIESIN: In the morning.

1683
02:25:28,021 --> 02:25:29,525
MARISHA: Yeah, what time is it?

1684
02:25:29,525 --> 02:25:30,931
MATT: You're in the evening now.

1685
02:25:30,931 --> 02:25:32,215
LAURA: Let's Misty Step there--

1686
02:25:32,215 --> 02:25:34,682
MATT: Misty Step is a very different spell.

1687
02:25:34,682 --> 02:25:36,162
LAURA: Oh, sorry.

1688
02:25:36,162 --> 02:25:38,321
LIAM: We go 30 feet.

1689
02:25:38,321 --> 02:25:40,627
(laughter)

1690
02:25:40,627 --> 02:25:46,581
SAM: We're going to be windtalkers.

1691
02:25:46,581 --> 02:25:52,874
MATT: Yes. All right, so you guys go ahead and
transform into your misty forms via the Wind Walk

1692
02:25:52,874 --> 02:26:02,080
spell and begin making your way to the east,
towards the Herethis Wood. Travel is pretty rapid.

1693
02:26:02,080 --> 02:26:09,749
It's a clear sky. The moon's still pretty-- it's
only been a few days since the last full moon when

1694
02:26:09,749 --> 02:26:16,613
you guys had the ritual up at the top of the
mountains with the Trickfoots, so it's very easy

1695
02:26:16,613 --> 02:26:23,177
to see the details, especially those of keen
vision. Rather rapidly, you find yourselves to the

1696
02:26:23,177 --> 02:26:28,668
outskirts of the Herethis Forest, and after doing
a couple passes overhead, you can see there is a

1697
02:26:28,668 --> 02:26:33,761
portion of the forest that is open, and there you
can see there are a couple of stone towers set up.

1698
02:26:33,761 --> 02:26:42,109
There appear to be large ropes and cables fastened
at the edges of what looks to be a large circular

1699
02:26:42,109 --> 02:26:50,218
ravine, some sort of an entry port, a very large
hole in the ground. And as you approach and get

1700
02:26:50,218 --> 02:26:56,693
close you can see that, while there are two standing
towers, there appear to be remnants of two other

1701
02:26:56,693 --> 02:27:01,348
towers that have fallen in, and looking at some of
the cables and the way that some of the equipment

1702
02:27:01,348 --> 02:27:07,414
is set up, it appears that this sinkhole that he
spoke of that consumed a portion of this entryway,

1703
02:27:07,414 --> 02:27:12,506
whether it be a quake or something, a lot of the
structure that was placed around the outside of

1704
02:27:12,506 --> 02:27:19,698
the mine has fallen in, and is precariously being
held either dangling over the inside by cable work

1705
02:27:19,698 --> 02:27:25,427
or has crumpled somewhere at the bottom of this
abyssal hole you see before you.

1706
02:27:25,427 --> 02:27:31,061
MARISHA: What do you mean by--

1707
02:27:31,061 --> 02:27:35,571
MATT: When I say abyssal hole, that's just a
descriptive way of saying it is pitch black from

1708
02:27:35,571 --> 02:27:37,657
this distance. You cannot see anything past the
top.

1709
02:27:37,657 --> 02:27:43,247
SAM: And it's connected to the Abyssal Plane.

1710
02:27:43,247 --> 02:27:48,587
MATT: It is actually a doorway to the Abyss. Hey
guys! Orcus tonight!

1711
02:27:48,587 --> 02:27:51,518
MARISHA: Finale!

1712
02:27:51,518 --> 02:27:55,772
TRAVIS: Do we have any glow sticks that we could
throw in and watch fall?

1713
02:27:55,772 --> 02:27:58,925
TALIESIN: Yes, we actually do.

1714
02:27:58,925 --> 02:28:03,892
MATT: Have you guys transitioned back to your
physical forms to have this conversation?

1715
02:28:03,892 --> 02:28:06,356
MARISHA: Yeah. Well, we can float down.

1716
02:28:06,356 --> 02:28:12,385
TALIESIN: If we're doing our little circle, I
would say that a little bit of a distance.

1717
02:28:12,385 --> 02:28:14,406
LAURA: Yeah, I don't want to camp right next to
the--

1718
02:28:14,406 --> 02:28:17,709
TALIESIN: About half a mile away.

1719
02:28:17,709 --> 02:28:20,979
LIAM: I'm looking for cooties around the outside.

1720
02:28:20,979 --> 02:28:23,516
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

1721
02:28:23,516 --> 02:28:24,820
LIAM: Cooties.

1722
02:28:24,820 --> 02:28:27,055
LAURA: Did you get it?

1723
02:28:27,055 --> 02:28:29,179
ASHLEY: No, it's right here.

1724
02:28:29,179 --> 02:28:31,003
LIAM: Dang it. 24.

1725
02:28:31,003 --> 02:28:45,734
MATT: 24. Okay, you start coasting over the edge, and
you can see there are broken carts and crates. You

1726
02:28:45,734 --> 02:28:55,781
can see the remains of what seem to be a couple of
humanoid bodies, mostly picked away to the point

1727
02:28:55,781 --> 02:29:00,843
where there's just slightly pinkish bone from
whatever dried bits of muscle or blood that

1728
02:29:00,843 --> 02:29:05,082
remain, the rest of the flesh and organs pulled
from or dissolved. You're not sure.

1729
02:29:05,082 --> 02:29:08,761
LAURA: I think a Cure Wounds, a light Cure Wounds
would probably help.

1730
02:29:08,761 --> 02:29:10,837
SAM: Dead talk?

1731
02:29:10,837 --> 02:29:13,397
TALIESIN: They don't talk back, but yeah.

1732
02:29:13,397 --> 02:29:15,378
SAM: Let's do that.

1733
02:29:15,378 --> 02:29:17,739
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, you can do that!

1734
02:29:17,739 --> 02:29:21,209
ASHLEY: We can talk to the dead. I have it.

1735
02:29:21,209 --> 02:29:26,970
LAURA: We'll land a little bit away.

1736
02:29:26,970 --> 02:29:29,858
TRAVIS: We didn't land yet, right?

1737
02:29:29,858 --> 02:29:31,337
LAURA: Let's land a little bit away.

1738
02:29:31,337 --> 02:29:33,299
LIAM: Getting some Baldur's Gate vibes here, man.

1739
02:29:33,299 --> 02:29:38,919
MATT: So you land about half a mile out, and you
guys transition back to your physical forms. Vax

1740
02:29:38,919 --> 02:29:41,363
shares the information and what he spotted.

1741
02:29:41,363 --> 02:29:43,940
LAURA: Were the bodies on top or were the bodies
down below?

1742
02:29:43,940 --> 02:29:45,110
LIAM: On the edges, right?

1743
02:29:45,110 --> 02:29:46,875
MATT: They were on the edges.

1744
02:29:46,875 --> 02:29:51,873
MARISHA: And when you mean seared, like acid? Or
like heat?

1745
02:29:51,873 --> 02:29:56,923
MATT: Like white and pink bone. Like just whatever
flesh was on there has been picked off.

1746
02:29:56,923 --> 02:29:59,567
ASHLEY: Like something was eating them?

1747
02:29:59,567 --> 02:30:01,254
TALIESIN: Can we speak to dead?

1748
02:30:01,254 --> 02:30:02,906
LAURA: Pike can do that.

1749
02:30:02,906 --> 02:30:10,177
TALIESIN: Why don't you two misty there, somebody
start setting up camp for tonight.

1750
02:30:10,177 --> 02:30:12,413
LAURA: I'll go with Pike and we can stealth in.

1751
02:30:12,413 --> 02:30:13,839
MARISHA: I'll start setting up camp.

1752
02:30:13,839 --> 02:30:17,103
TALIESIN: You can still misty. We're still
misty-able. You can fly in, talk to them,

1753
02:30:17,103 --> 02:30:18,401
and fly back out.

1754
02:30:18,401 --> 02:30:19,796
LAURA: She can't talk to them as mist.

1755
02:30:19,796 --> 02:30:21,140
TALIESIN: I mean, land and then--

1756
02:30:21,140 --> 02:30:25,425
LAURA: Oh, okay. I'll cast Pass Without a Trace,
anyways, so we'll be stealthy going in.

1757
02:30:25,425 --> 02:30:26,711
So I do that.

1758
02:30:26,711 --> 02:30:28,854
MATT: All right, so. Is it just you, Pike? Who's
going with you?

1759
02:30:28,854 --> 02:30:29,957
LAURA: And me.

1760
02:30:29,957 --> 02:30:31,883
LIAM: I'm already standing by the bodies, yeah.

1761
02:30:31,883 --> 02:30:33,305
MATT: All right, so you go back to the bodies with
them?

1762
02:30:33,305 --> 02:30:34,545
LAURA: Okay, you're still out there?

1763
02:30:34,545 --> 02:30:35,886
LIAM: No, I--

1764
02:30:35,886 --> 02:30:39,705
MATT: All right, so the three of you are turning
back to mist and making your way back toward the

1765
02:30:39,705 --> 02:30:40,975
entrance.

1766
02:30:40,975 --> 02:30:43,118
TALIESIN: I'm going to set up the tents.

1767
02:30:43,118 --> 02:30:51,750
MATT: Okay. You guys land near the edge of this
crumpled rock and you see where the ground itself

1768
02:30:51,829 --> 02:30:58,304
has curled in and collapsed inward, and there are a
number of cables or ropes that go across and

1769
02:30:58,346 --> 02:31:03,045
various large structures, the stone towers that
sit at the edge of this opening. You can see

1770
02:31:03,045 --> 02:31:07,904
there's tension on these ropes and either the
rope's going to snap at some point as the weather

1771
02:31:07,904 --> 02:31:13,125
gets harsher over here, or the rock is going to
crumble in if the ground keeps eroding. You're not

1772
02:31:13,125 --> 02:31:19,330
sure if it's done, or if it's a slow crawling
thing. There before you, you see a body. You can

1773
02:31:19,330 --> 02:31:27,719
see elements of clothing, torn and dried, crusted
with old blood. You see a boot that's left off to

1774
02:31:27,719 --> 02:31:31,967
the side. The foot's been removed, but it looks
like the edge of it's been torn and ripped a bit.

1775
02:31:31,967 --> 02:31:34,511
The skeleton's been picked clean.

1776
02:31:34,511 --> 02:31:37,966
ASHLEY: Okay. We only see the one body?

1777
02:31:37,966 --> 02:31:41,881
MATT: There are three bodies around the whole
exterior, but you've landed next to one.

1778
02:31:41,881 --> 02:31:44,965
LIAM: When you said picked clean, do they look
like they've been chewed upon?

1779
02:31:44,965 --> 02:31:47,036
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1780
02:31:47,036 --> 02:31:49,869
LIAM: It's fine. 18.

1781
02:31:49,869 --> 02:31:57,485
MATT: Looking at the bones, you can see signs of
what appear to be scratches or grooves across the

1782
02:31:57,485 --> 02:32:09,321
bones... It's interesting. A lot of the bones have
a very smooth texture to them. You're used to

1783
02:32:09,321 --> 02:32:14,688
seeing very porous, but it looks like elements of
the bones have melted slightly.

1784
02:32:14,688 --> 02:32:15,860
LAURA: Oh, gods.

1785
02:32:15,860 --> 02:32:22,457
LIAM: Slimes, jellies. All right.

1786
02:32:22,457 --> 02:32:28,241
LAURA: I'm going to get my broom ready. And while
Pike is doing her ritual I'm just going to keep a

1787
02:32:28,241 --> 02:32:32,099
hand on her, that if anything happens then I can
just take off with her in tow.

1788
02:32:32,099 --> 02:32:37,500
MATT: Okay. Pike, you're casting Speak with Dead?

1789
02:32:37,500 --> 02:32:39,635
ASHLEY: Yes.

1790
02:32:39,635 --> 02:32:44,977
MATT: All right. It's easy enough for you to cast
it. It's quick. Ritual complete, you go ahead and you

1791
02:32:44,977 --> 02:32:46,792
burn some incense.

1792
02:32:46,977 --> 02:32:49,804
ASHLEY: Okay, I get three questions.

1793
02:32:49,804 --> 02:32:58,647
MATT: And at which point, the skeleton, which is
face down on the ground by the way, the skull

1794
02:32:58,647 --> 02:33:07,078
(bone creaking) creaks up and looks over. Like,
turns around and faces you as it reaches. It curls

1795
02:33:07,078 --> 02:33:11,011
upward, almost in like an upward dog--

1796
02:33:11,011 --> 02:33:13,028
LAURA: Like downward dog? Oh. What's that called?

1797
02:33:13,028 --> 02:33:16,550
MATT: Cobra position, but the head's turned
completely around and curled up.

1798
02:33:16,550 --> 02:33:20,818
LIAM: Oh, I get down close to it and go (groans) and
I flip it over.

1799
02:33:20,863 --> 02:33:24,366
MATT: (rattling thud) It flips over on its back
and the head (bone creaking) turns back

1800
02:33:24,366 --> 02:33:25,542
around to its right.

1801
02:33:25,542 --> 02:33:26,808
LIAM: Sorry.

1802
02:33:26,808 --> 02:33:28,152
MATT: You get five questions.

1803
02:33:28,152 --> 02:33:29,226
ASHLEY: Five questions.

1804
02:33:29,226 --> 02:33:30,526
MARISHA: Five?

1805
02:33:30,526 --> 02:33:35,851
ASHLEY: Good day, sir. It's not a good day for
you. Sorry.

1806
02:33:35,851 --> 02:33:37,221
TRAVIS: Wow.

1807
02:33:37,221 --> 02:33:39,391
LAURA: It's okay. Good start.

1808
02:33:39,391 --> 02:33:42,617
ASHLEY: What happened to you?

1809
02:33:42,617 --> 02:34:04,776
MATT: (raspy, strained) "Something in the mines we
found. It hatched. Or woke. And its anger shook

1810
02:34:04,776 --> 02:34:18,807
"the halls. I tried to run, but the skittering
beasts got me first."

1811
02:34:18,807 --> 02:34:21,532
LAURA: Skittering beasts?

1812
02:34:21,532 --> 02:34:23,116
TRAVIS: Godzilla.

1813
02:34:23,116 --> 02:34:25,030
LIAM: That's more than one.

1814
02:34:25,030 --> 02:34:27,585
LAURA: (whispering) What did the skitterers look
like?

1815
02:34:27,585 --> 02:34:35,688
ASHLEY: What did the skittering beasts look like?

1816
02:34:35,688 --> 02:34:37,498
LAURA: Oh, in my drink?

1817
02:34:37,498 --> 02:34:39,160
LIAM: It flew away.

1818
02:34:39,160 --> 02:34:41,310
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a dick.

1819
02:34:41,310 --> 02:34:57,155
MATT: (raspy, strained) "Large. Hard carapaces.
Pincers. Many legs."

1820
02:34:57,155 --> 02:34:59,560
ASHLEY: (whispering) It's like spiders.

1821
02:34:59,560 --> 02:35:01,680
TRAVIS: Umber hulk?

1822
02:35:01,680 --> 02:35:04,172
LIAM: Umber hulk with many legs.

1823
02:35:04,172 --> 02:35:09,915
MARISHA: That could be a glabrezu, which fucking
killed you the first time. They have pincers.

1824
02:35:09,915 --> 02:35:11,642
LAURA: Yeah, but that's really big.

1825
02:35:11,642 --> 02:35:14,485
MARISHA: I don't know. Skittering beasts?

1826
02:35:14,485 --> 02:35:16,356
ASHLEY: Is there anyone else alive?

1827
02:35:16,356 --> 02:35:19,777
LIAM: Did anything work against it?

1828
02:35:19,777 --> 02:35:27,635
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah that's a good question. (louder)
Was there anything that you guys could tell of

1829
02:35:27,635 --> 02:35:33,254
your knowledge-- did anything seem to damage it or
work against it?

1830
02:35:33,254 --> 02:35:43,598
MATT: (grunts) He seems confused about what you're
referring to. The skittering creature or the--

1831
02:35:43,598 --> 02:35:46,029
ASHLEY: Oh. The skittering creature or the big
thing?

1832
02:35:46,029 --> 02:35:47,736
LAURA: The skittering creatures?

1833
02:35:47,736 --> 02:35:52,831
ASHLEY: Both, because we still have--

1834
02:35:52,831 --> 02:35:54,726
LIAM: Against them

1835
02:35:54,726 --> 02:35:59,894
ASHLEY: Against them! Against the skittering
creatures

1836
02:35:59,894 --> 02:36:08,267
MATT: "The skittering creatures, we just ran. I
didn't look to see."

1837
02:36:08,267 --> 02:36:12,942
LAURA: That's already three questions.

1838
02:36:12,942 --> 02:36:22,380
ASHLEY: Okay. Oh god, this is not--

1839
02:36:22,380 --> 02:36:32,065
(whispering)

1840
02:36:32,065 --> 02:36:43,735
ASHLEY: How big were the creatures?

1841
02:36:43,735 --> 02:37:06,418
MATT: "They were rather large, maybe eight foot
end to end. They burrow, they spit. But they were

1842
02:37:06,418 --> 02:37:10,353
"awoken by the smaller one."

1843
02:37:10,353 --> 02:37:12,999
ASHLEY: Wait, he said they spit?

1844
02:37:12,999 --> 02:37:20,128
LAURA: I didn't hear, something about his spit.
What did he say?

1845
02:37:20,128 --> 02:37:25,284
MATT: You gather, what he said was--

1846
02:37:25,284 --> 02:37:30,478
(laughing)

1847
02:37:30,478 --> 02:37:44,127
MATT: No, the skitterers bite, they spit. But they
were awakened by the smaller one.

1848
02:37:44,127 --> 02:37:46,687
MARISHA: The smaller one?

1849
02:37:46,687 --> 02:37:49,885
LAURA: What's the smaller one?!

1850
02:37:49,885 --> 02:37:53,645
LIAM: What can you tell us of the smaller one?

1851
02:37:53,645 --> 02:37:55,785
SAM: They spit. Maybe acid, probably.

1852
02:37:55,785 --> 02:38:01,780
LIAM: Yeah, they're smooth, that means they were
just like (slurping noises).

1853
02:38:01,780 --> 02:38:07,563
ASHLEY: Is there anything that you can tell us
about the smaller one?

1854
02:38:07,563 --> 02:38:25,967
MATT: "It was like a baby, and it cried out and
everything fell around us. I barely made it out,

1855
02:38:25,967 --> 02:38:37,630
"but the skitterers found me." (deep exhale) The
enchantment leaves that embodied the skull, falls

1856
02:38:37,630 --> 02:38:39,860
to rest, the bones now motionless.

1857
02:38:39,860 --> 02:38:43,129
SAM: So it can emit a cry that shakes everything.

1858
02:38:43,129 --> 02:38:44,824
ASHLEY: A baby, like a baby?

1859
02:38:44,824 --> 02:38:46,405
LIAM: Mandrake?

1860
02:38:46,405 --> 02:38:48,174
MATT: I would say, Marisha--

1861
02:38:48,174 --> 02:38:54,418
MARISHA: Does it sound like anything we have
encountered? A nature check?

1862
02:38:54,489 --> 02:38:57,209
MATT: We'll say a nature check for both you and
Vex.

1863
02:38:57,209 --> 02:39:00,383
MARISHA: Would I have an advantage with my little
book?

1864
02:39:00,383 --> 02:39:05,442
MATT: Not for this in particular.

1865
02:39:05,442 --> 02:39:07,836
LIAM: It will be like the creature back in
Stillben?

1866
02:39:07,836 --> 02:39:09,835
LAURA: Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.

1867
02:39:09,835 --> 02:39:13,199
LIAM: And we have heard tales of mandrakes, and
they scream.

1868
02:39:13,274 --> 02:39:17,367
LAURA: Yeah, did the pincers sound like something
we have fought though, before?

1869
02:39:17,367 --> 02:39:20,918
MATT: No, it's not something you've encountered before,
necessarily.

1870
02:39:21,117 --> 02:39:22,872
MARISHA: 19?

1871
02:39:22,872 --> 02:39:26,440
MATT: 19, okay. And Vex?

1872
02:39:26,440 --> 02:39:27,640
LAURA: Nature check?

1873
02:39:27,640 --> 02:39:28,683
MATT: Yeah.

1874
02:39:28,683 --> 02:39:33,123
LAURA: Do I get advantage because I'm standing in
the woods? Six!

1875
02:39:33,123 --> 02:39:37,768
TALIESIN: You know you're standing in the woods.

1876
02:39:37,768 --> 02:39:44,325
MATT: You have heard of a creature that does exist
in subterranean and sometimes forested areas,

1877
02:39:44,325 --> 02:39:48,436
referred to as an ankheg.

1878
02:39:48,436 --> 02:39:50,832
MARISHA: An ankheg?

1879
02:39:50,832 --> 02:39:58,953
MATT: An ankheg. They generally tend to snatch
cattle and beasts of burden in the night. They are

1880
02:39:58,953 --> 02:40:08,833
large and insect-like. They spit an acidic fluid.
Some of the things this corpse has described makes

1881
02:40:08,833 --> 02:40:10,288
you think of that.

1882
02:40:10,288 --> 02:40:15,259
LIAM: Isn't that what our bug juice is made out
of?

1883
02:40:15,259 --> 02:40:20,990
MATT: You bug juice is made of sandkheg, which is
a desert-based variant of that creature.

1884
02:40:20,990 --> 02:40:27,316
LAURA: Oh. I wonder if we could sprinkle it around
us and they won't bother us because we'll smell

1885
02:40:27,316 --> 02:40:28,912
like their brethren.

1886
02:40:28,912 --> 02:40:31,221
TRAVIS: I ain't wasting that shit!

1887
02:40:31,221 --> 02:40:33,617
LAURA: Hey, man, it's an idea.

1888
02:40:33,617 --> 02:40:35,505
MARISHA: So they snatch cattle--

1889
02:40:35,505 --> 02:40:38,450
SAM: So we should all be cows.

1890
02:40:38,450 --> 02:40:42,388
MARISHA: Oh my god, you guys. Perfect
opportunity!

1891
02:40:42,388 --> 02:40:44,958
LIAM and MARISHA: Throwback Thursday!

1892
02:40:44,958 --> 02:40:49,645
MATT: If only the person who could cast the spell
was in your party anymore. He's elsewhere in the

1893
02:40:49,645 --> 02:40:50,864
world right now.

1894
02:40:50,864 --> 02:40:52,245
LIAM: That asshole.

1895
02:40:52,245 --> 02:40:54,490
SAM: We just talked to him. He was the dead body.

1896
02:40:54,490 --> 02:40:57,487
(groaning)

1897
02:40:57,487 --> 02:40:59,743
MATT: All right, so what are you guys doing?

1898
02:40:59,743 --> 02:41:05,795
SAM: Well, we're going to rest for the night, and
then go in at first light.

1899
02:41:05,795 --> 02:41:08,437
LAURA: Yes, we definitely should have a Heroes'
Feast.

1900
02:41:08,437 --> 02:41:12,136
MARISHA: Yeah, let's have a Heroes' Feast, which--
okay, hang on, let me check here.

1901
02:41:12,136 --> 02:41:13,600
TRAVIS: We don't need it.

1902
02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:15,553
MARISHA: I can do a Heroes' Feast.

1903
02:41:15,553 --> 02:41:18,798
TALIESIN: Protection from acid would probably be
very--

1904
02:41:18,798 --> 02:41:26,034
MARISHA: Okay, but my Wind Walk-- I already Wind
Walked, so I can do a Heroes' Feast at a higher

1905
02:41:26,034 --> 02:41:37,433
level. I also want to do a 5th-level Commune with
Nature.

1906
02:41:37,433 --> 02:41:46,193
MATT: Okay. 5th-level Commune with Nature.

1907
02:41:46,193 --> 02:41:49,595
MARISHA: What should I ask? What should I ask that
we don't already know?

1908
02:41:49,595 --> 02:41:52,824
SAM: I mean, is there any nature down there? It's
a mine. It's all rocks.

1909
02:41:52,824 --> 02:41:58,656
MARISHA: Well, I can see in a two-, three-mile
radius.

1910
02:41:58,656 --> 02:42:00,209
TRAVIS: How deep does the hole go?

1911
02:42:00,209 --> 02:42:01,688
MARISHA: I was thinking that.

1912
02:42:01,688 --> 02:42:06,742
MATT: Instantly gain knowledge of up to three
facts of your choice about any of the following

1913
02:42:06,742 --> 02:42:12,347
subjects as they relate to the area: terrain;
bodies of water; prevalent plants, minerals,

1914
02:42:12,347 --> 02:42:19,902
animals, or peoples; powerful celestials, fey,
fiends, elementals, or undead; influence from

1915
02:42:19,902 --> 02:42:21,664
other planes of existence; or buildings.

1916
02:42:21,664 --> 02:42:22,513
MARISHA: Okay.

1917
02:42:22,513 --> 02:42:23,891
MATT: Choose three of those.

1918
02:42:23,891 --> 02:42:27,694
MARISHA: First and foremost, influences from other
planes of existence.

1919
02:42:27,694 --> 02:42:35,145
MATT: Okay, so as you focus and Commune with
Nature, the plants speak to you in this series of

1920
02:42:35,145 --> 02:42:43,116
images and thoughts that essentially get the idea
across to you that there is something planar

1921
02:42:43,116 --> 02:42:48,617
involved here, but it's very old and long-dormant,
recently awoken.

1922
02:42:48,617 --> 02:42:58,125
MARISHA: Okay. Planar, long dormant.

1923
02:42:58,125 --> 02:42:59,991
TALIESIN: Recently awoken.

1924
02:42:59,991 --> 02:43:09,041
TRAVIS: If it's a fucking baby ancient dragon I'm
going to be stoked.

1925
02:43:09,041 --> 02:43:11,424
MARISHA: Okay, so something planar.

1926
02:43:11,424 --> 02:43:14,640
LIAM: Didn't Drez Vina send us to a fetal thing?

1927
02:43:14,640 --> 02:43:16,834
MARISHA: Yeah, that was our first fight.

1928
02:43:16,834 --> 02:43:19,063
SAM: Oh, we can't do how deep is the mine? No?

1929
02:43:19,063 --> 02:43:25,766
MARISHA: No, I can, it's a terrain question, so
terrain. Yeah. How deep does this mine go?

1930
02:43:25,766 --> 02:43:29,367
LAURA: Maybe you can ask where the thing is in the
mine.

1931
02:43:29,367 --> 02:43:34,029
MARISHA: Is. I think I can, right? Can I sense the
location of where--?

1932
02:43:34,029 --> 02:43:35,927
MATT: You can ask whereabouts this thing is.

1933
02:43:35,927 --> 02:43:37,103
MARISHA: Yeah.

1934
02:43:37,103 --> 02:43:42,850
MATT: Nature tells you this sinkhole goes down for
about a quarter-mile,

1935
02:43:42,850 --> 02:43:46,861
and it lies at the very bottom.

1936
02:43:46,861 --> 02:43:50,410
LAURA: It's just straight down at the bottom of
it?

1937
02:43:50,410 --> 02:43:52,221
TRAVIS: That's 400 meters, y'all.

1938
02:43:52,221 --> 02:43:57,277
ASHLEY: So it's like this and then the little baby
thing at the bottom?

1939
02:43:57,277 --> 02:44:00,281
MATT: Apparently, yeah. The whole ground just
collapsed inward.

1940
02:44:00,281 --> 02:44:04,927
MARISHA: 400 meters and the entity lies at the
bottom.

1941
02:44:04,927 --> 02:44:08,246
SAM: We can just jump. We're like gods.

1942
02:44:08,246 --> 02:44:09,260
MARISHA: Yeah, we're gods!

1943
02:44:09,260 --> 02:44:10,498
TALIESIN: We're golden gods.

1944
02:44:10,498 --> 02:44:13,339
MARISHA: It's only a little bit more than 1000
feet.

1945
02:44:13,339 --> 02:44:18,110
LAURA: Yeah, then you might survive that one? Only
if you turn into a goldfish and fall onto the

1946
02:44:18,157 --> 02:44:19,597
ground. It's fine.

1947
02:44:19,597 --> 02:44:23,422
MARISHA: Now I know Looney Tune physics doesn't
work in this world.

1948
02:44:23,422 --> 02:44:26,098
LIAM: Always go earth elemental.

1949
02:44:26,098 --> 02:44:29,422
LAURA and MARISHA: Always Keyteor.

1950
02:44:29,496 --> 02:44:31,516
SAM: So what's our last question?

1951
02:44:31,516 --> 02:44:35,218
TRAVIS: Something from another plane. We know it's
400 meters down.

1952
02:44:35,218 --> 02:44:36,659
MARISHA: It lies at the bottom.

1953
02:44:36,659 --> 02:44:38,880
TALIESIN: How many of these creatures are there?

1954
02:44:38,880 --> 02:44:42,409
TRAVIS: Of the crawly ones?

1955
02:44:42,409 --> 02:44:48,520
MARISHA: Ankhegs. Can I get a sense of how many
and whereabouts the ankhegs are?

1956
02:44:48,520 --> 02:44:50,729
MATT: One of the two.

1957
02:44:50,729 --> 02:44:55,376
LAURA: What are ankhegs? Are they fiends?

1958
02:44:55,376 --> 02:44:58,971
LIAM: They're beasts, probably. They're big bugs.

1959
02:44:58,971 --> 02:45:01,322
LAURA: Aberrations?

1960
02:45:01,322 --> 02:45:02,847
MARISHA: How many?

1961
02:45:02,847 --> 02:45:04,674
TRAVIS: Yeah, because if there's hundreds, then--

1962
02:45:04,674 --> 02:45:05,839
MARISHA: That's a problem.

1963
02:45:05,839 --> 02:45:08,411
TALIESIN: Then this is a stealth mission.

1964
02:45:08,411 --> 02:45:11,814
MATT: They are monstrosities, and that's what they
look like right there.

1965
02:45:11,814 --> 02:45:14,923
ALL: Oh!

1966
02:45:14,923 --> 02:45:17,135
TALIESIN: I love Starship Troopers. I'm excited.

1967
02:45:17,135 --> 02:45:22,024
LAURA: We're about to fight some big, armored
vaginas.

1968
02:45:22,024 --> 02:45:29,901
MARISHA: About how many? Do I know about how many
there are? Sensing their skittering movements

1969
02:45:29,901 --> 02:45:31,416
under the surface.

1970
02:45:31,416 --> 02:45:41,132
MATT: Using the nature's essence to let you know:
somewhere in the neighborhood of about close to a

1971
02:45:41,132 --> 02:45:45,743
hundred. Throughout the network of caves--

1972
02:45:45,743 --> 02:45:48,384
MARISHA: Because this is a three-mile radius,
right?

1973
02:45:48,384 --> 02:45:53,218
MATT: Yeah, so this is spread out amongst what
would essentially be a subterranean anthill of

1974
02:45:53,218 --> 02:45:54,677
these ankhegs.

1975
02:45:54,677 --> 02:45:56,737
MARISHA: There's a lot.

1976
02:45:56,737 --> 02:46:06,431
TRAVIS: We're going to need a fast exit. He wants
us to take care of what the problem was.

1977
02:46:06,431 --> 02:46:16,222
SAM: We've just got to kill the big boss. One
little baby big boss. The boss baby.

1978
02:46:16,222 --> 02:46:28,030
LAURA: Did we understand correctly that it's the
baby that cried out is the big monster?

1979
02:46:28,030 --> 02:46:29,373
The big boss?

1980
02:46:29,373 --> 02:46:31,417
MATT: It seems to be the source of where all this
started.

1981
02:46:31,489 --> 02:46:34,370
LAURA: Okay. And that's the thing that woke up the
skitterers?

1982
02:46:34,370 --> 02:46:38,259
MATT: Or at least brought them to start attacking
the surface.

1983
02:46:38,259 --> 02:46:41,494
LAURA: Okay. I just wanted to make sure it wasn't
like, there's a big boss and then there's

1984
02:46:41,494 --> 02:46:44,055
skitterers and then there's also little babies
that cry out.

1985
02:46:44,055 --> 02:46:46,150
MATT: You don't know. This is all the information
you have.

1986
02:46:46,150 --> 02:46:50,058
ASHLEY: But do we know why the baby woke up? What
woke the baby?

1987
02:46:50,058 --> 02:46:52,200
LAURA: No, we don't know what woke up the baby.

1988
02:46:52,200 --> 02:46:53,366
ASHLEY: We didn't ask that? Okay.

1989
02:46:53,366 --> 02:46:55,271
LAURA: Maybe we should talk to another dead
person.

1990
02:46:55,271 --> 02:46:57,401
TRAVIS: Nah.

1991
02:46:57,401 --> 02:46:59,207
SAM and TALIESIN: I don't think they'll know.

1992
02:46:59,207 --> 02:47:01,838
LAURA: They're not miners.

1993
02:47:01,838 --> 02:47:07,336
ASHLEY: They did something in the mine that awoke
it. And we can redo it.

1994
02:47:07,336 --> 02:47:11,554
TALIESIN: I think anybody who was there who saw it
probably died at the center of it.

1995
02:47:11,554 --> 02:47:22,633
LIAM: Sorry, we're trying to remember the very
first game of D&D we ever played and Keyleth,

1996
02:47:22,633 --> 02:47:24,555
twins, Grog were there.

1997
02:47:24,555 --> 02:47:34,274
MATT: Yeah, that's right. That was what was
essentially a dead or stillborn deity. A demigod,

1998
02:47:34,274 --> 02:47:36,438
essentially, in its own pocket plane.

1999
02:47:36,438 --> 02:47:39,120
MARISHA: So does it have anything to do with
this?

2000
02:47:39,120 --> 02:47:40,784
MATT: Roll a religion check.

2001
02:47:40,784 --> 02:47:45,526
MARISHA: No. I'm bad at this! (groans)

2002
02:47:45,526 --> 02:47:47,352
LIAM: I'm religious!

2003
02:47:47,352 --> 02:47:51,638
MATT: Yeah, if you want to, whoever's having this
conversation you can make a religion check.

2004
02:47:51,638 --> 02:47:53,313
LIAM: Luck of the day. Yes!

2005
02:47:53,313 --> 02:47:55,959
LAURA: Natural 20.

2006
02:47:55,959 --> 02:47:56,814
MARISHA: Are you serious?

2007
02:47:56,814 --> 02:48:00,299
LAURA: No, I haven't rolled. I'm trying to make
myself roll it.

2008
02:48:00,299 --> 02:48:01,983
LIAM: I got a 19.

2009
02:48:01,983 --> 02:48:04,101
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my god I rolled a natural 20!

2010
02:48:04,101 --> 02:48:05,138
MARISHA: Shut up!

2011
02:48:05,138 --> 02:48:06,498
TRAVIS: She really did.

2012
02:48:06,498 --> 02:48:11,557
LAURA: It's like <i>Run Lola, Run</i> where she's doing
the roulette thing and she's like--

2013
02:48:11,557 --> 02:48:24,650
MATT: Okay. You recall a while back that you
battled with that entity, you-- what was it

2014
02:48:24,650 --> 02:48:26,097
called? Crysa-Thul.

2015
02:48:26,097 --> 02:48:29,989
LAURA: How?

2016
02:48:29,989 --> 02:48:40,515
MATT: (sighs) This is all I do with my free time,
guys. Make up shit for fun. But that was not tiny.

2017
02:48:40,515 --> 02:48:45,291
That was a very large entity. Like, to the point
where you remember there was a 20-foot-wide well

2018
02:48:45,291 --> 02:48:52,436
and a giant fleshy baby arm that slapped out and
crawled it out Akira-style. Everyone kept saying

2019
02:48:52,436 --> 02:49:00,254
small on this one, so you don't know if-- maybe
related in some way? But you're not entirely

2020
02:49:00,254 --> 02:49:03,903
certain. It doesn't appear to be the same kind of
thing, necessarily.

2021
02:49:03,903 --> 02:49:05,962
Not by the descriptor you've heard.

2022
02:49:05,962 --> 02:49:08,844
LIAM: Corpse called it a small one, right?

2023
02:49:08,844 --> 02:49:10,320
MATT: It called it a small one.

2024
02:49:10,320 --> 02:49:15,308
TRAVIS: We're good. We've still got to camp for
the night, right?

2025
02:49:15,308 --> 02:49:21,207
LAURA: Yeah. We're camping. But we should camp in
the trees, y'all. Not in the ground, in case the

2026
02:49:21,207 --> 02:49:22,330
things come up out.

2027
02:49:22,330 --> 02:49:27,391
MATT: Yeah, the thick forest of Herethis surrounds
the mine.

2028
02:49:27,391 --> 02:49:29,112
LAURA: Oh man.

2029
02:49:29,112 --> 02:49:34,531
MARISHA: Can I Druidcraft some web hammocks?

2030
02:49:34,531 --> 02:49:39,016
TALIESIN: I mean you can, I mean we've gone to all
this trouble, but if we want to add to it. I mean,

2031
02:49:39,016 --> 02:49:40,521
this is just what we've been doing.

2032
02:49:40,521 --> 02:49:42,634
MARISHA: Look, I really like elaborate tree
houses.

2033
02:49:42,634 --> 02:49:44,587
TALIESIN: No, I understand. I respect the art
form.

2034
02:49:44,587 --> 02:49:47,124
MARISHA: I can have a rope bridge here.

2035
02:49:47,124 --> 02:49:48,458
LIAM: Hammock bed.

2036
02:49:48,458 --> 02:49:53,200
MATT: We'll say Druidcraft, which is a very
localized and cantrip-based magic, you could, over

2037
02:49:53,200 --> 02:49:55,609
the next couple hours craft a single web hammock.

2038
02:49:55,609 --> 02:49:57,163
(groaning)

2039
02:49:57,163 --> 02:49:59,002
MATT: It's a cantrip, yo!

2040
02:49:59,002 --> 02:50:04,663
MARISHA: I'll pass. We'll just sleep with the ones
we have or whatever

2041
02:50:04,663 --> 02:50:06,197
LIAM: A third-grade diorama.

2042
02:50:06,197 --> 02:50:14,513
MATT: Yeah. This is what it would look like if you
were to build to scale. Okay. So you guys find a

2043
02:50:14,513 --> 02:50:18,748
place in the trees? Who's helming finding that
spot? All right. Go ahead and roll an

2044
02:50:18,748 --> 02:50:20,703
investigation check.

2045
02:50:20,703 --> 02:50:26,404
LAURA: 15?

2046
02:50:26,404 --> 02:50:27,552
MATT: Okay.

2047
02:50:27,552 --> 02:50:31,957
LAURA: Oh wait! I honestly don't know anymore what
my favored terrain does for me.

2048
02:50:31,957 --> 02:50:35,769
MATT: No, this is exactly where to use it because
forest is your favored terrain. This is exactly

2049
02:50:35,769 --> 02:50:37,798
the kind of thing it would help with.

2050
02:50:37,798 --> 02:50:42,547
LAURA: I always feel like I'm bullshitting it now.
What am I rolling? Investigation?

2051
02:50:42,547 --> 02:50:43,592
MATT: Yes.

2052
02:50:43,592 --> 02:50:44,598
LAURA: 24.

2053
02:50:44,598 --> 02:50:50,537
MATT: 24. You find one massive tree. The trees
here can get pretty big, and there's one thick

2054
02:50:50,537 --> 02:50:55,349
tree that the branches are pretty easy to climb,
and up top it branches out and all the various

2055
02:50:55,349 --> 02:51:02,038
branches that make up the canopy. It's almost like
this little bowl at the very top, just underneath

2056
02:51:02,038 --> 02:51:07,448
where the heavy foliage descends, and it's a
perfect place for you guys to make a camp higher

2057
02:51:07,448 --> 02:51:08,618
up off the ground.

2058
02:51:08,618 --> 02:51:10,648
LAURA: Hey, this is a place! Let's do it here!

2059
02:51:10,648 --> 02:51:13,218
TALIESIN: I'll unload everything.

2060
02:51:13,218 --> 02:51:17,458
MATT: All right, you guys make camp. Who's making
first watch?

2061
02:51:17,458 --> 02:51:18,740
TRAVIS: Me!

2062
02:51:18,740 --> 02:51:19,822
LAURA: All right.

2063
02:51:19,822 --> 02:51:20,912
LIAM: Me, too.

2064
02:51:20,912 --> 02:51:22,441
ASHLEY: Oh! Heroes' Feast.

2065
02:51:22,441 --> 02:51:23,707
LAURA and MARISHA: Heroes' Feast.

2066
02:51:23,707 --> 02:51:31,785
MATT: All right. We'll say as a note, this the
last of the chalices you have prepared. If you

2067
02:51:31,785 --> 02:51:35,806
want to do any more Heroes' Feasts, you'll have to
specifically go and purchase the chalices or go

2068
02:51:35,806 --> 02:51:37,804
look for it in town.

2069
02:51:37,804 --> 02:51:39,224
LIAM: Let's do it!

2070
02:51:39,224 --> 02:51:41,774
MARISHA: Is this including or not including the
chalice that

2071
02:51:41,774 --> 02:51:45,001
Grog gave to Vex earlier to drink out of?

2072
02:51:45,001 --> 02:51:49,894
MATT: That chalice, while it looks quite
delightful, is not worth a thousand gold pieces.

2073
02:51:49,894 --> 02:51:51,571
TALIESIN: It's from Medieval Times.

2074
02:51:51,571 --> 02:51:53,092
MATT: (laughs) It's a little gaudy.

2075
02:51:53,092 --> 02:51:54,893
MARISHA: It's got Michael's. Michael's crafts.

2076
02:51:54,893 --> 02:52:01,540
MATT: Yeah, every time you drink from it you get
glitter on your hands and you're like, shit.

2077
02:52:01,613 --> 02:52:08,341
MARISHA: How do you turn it off? Cover it in
blankets.

2078
02:52:08,341 --> 02:52:10,151
LAURA: Yay, Heroes' Feast.

2079
02:52:10,151 --> 02:52:11,738
SAM: We're immune to fear?

2080
02:52:11,738 --> 02:52:13,983
MATT: You're immune to fear, immune to poison,
and--

2081
02:52:13,983 --> 02:52:15,559
LAURA: Advantage on wisdom.

2082
02:52:15,559 --> 02:52:17,926
MATT: Marisha, you want to go ahead and roll the
additional hit points for Heroes' Feast?

2083
02:52:17,926 --> 02:52:19,295
MARISHA: Yeah 2d10, yeah?

2084
02:52:19,295 --> 02:52:20,775
MATT: 2d10, I believe.

2085
02:52:20,775 --> 02:52:23,496
LAURA: We're losing our 17?

2086
02:52:23,496 --> 02:52:25,357
LIAM: Lose our 17 from the speech?

2087
02:52:25,357 --> 02:52:26,216
MATT: You do.

2088
02:52:26,216 --> 02:52:28,154
TRAVIS: That's why I didn't take them.

2089
02:52:28,154 --> 02:52:33,107
MARISHA: (gasps) Ooh! Wait, yeah! Ooh, that's
amazing! It's a nine and a ten!

2090
02:52:33,107 --> 02:52:36,129
MATT: So 19 additional hit points to all of you
guys.

2091
02:52:36,129 --> 02:52:40,875
LAURA: If you give us a speech, how long does that
last?

2092
02:52:40,875 --> 02:52:45,041
MATT: Temporary hit points last until they go down
or you take a long rest, I believe.

2093
02:52:45,041 --> 02:52:46,630
Let me double check.

2094
02:52:46,630 --> 02:52:48,305
MARISHA: But this is going to be a long rest?

2095
02:52:48,305 --> 02:52:51,224
LAURA: Oh wait, but does that mean we lose our
temporary hit points on the Heroes' Feast?

2096
02:52:51,224 --> 02:52:56,281
MATT: Well, no. They're different. The Heroes'
Feast is in addition to your maximum hit points.

2097
02:52:56,281 --> 02:53:03,623
Temporary hit points are different. Technically,
those two stack. You're about to lose the

2098
02:53:03,623 --> 02:53:04,669
temporary hit points.

2099
02:53:04,669 --> 02:53:07,042
MARISHA: But then at the top of the morning, I can
give us another speech.

2100
02:53:07,042 --> 02:53:08,495
MATT: Should you be so inclined, yeah.

2101
02:53:08,495 --> 02:53:09,513
LAURA: Tight.

2102
02:53:09,513 --> 02:53:10,985
MARISHA: Do I have to do it?

2103
02:53:10,985 --> 02:53:12,327
TRAVIS: No, you don't. You don't.

2104
02:53:12,327 --> 02:53:17,711
MARISHA: Fuck you, Travis. Fuck you.

2105
02:53:17,711 --> 02:53:21,449
MATT: You can give the essence of a speech.

2106
02:53:21,449 --> 02:53:26,408
MARISHA: Right, I can do an interpretive dance.

2107
02:53:26,408 --> 02:53:28,220
TRAVIS: That's better.

2108
02:53:28,220 --> 02:53:31,087
TALIESIN: Only if you actually do the interpretive
dance.

2109
02:53:31,087 --> 02:53:32,946
ASHLEY: Wait, 19 extra?

2110
02:53:32,946 --> 02:53:35,060
LAURA: He's giving you a look.

2111
02:53:35,060 --> 02:53:44,139
MARISHA: A laser light show. With fireflies. It's
like in a Disney Imagineer show.

2112
02:53:44,139 --> 02:53:45,816
MATT: It's a speech.

2113
02:53:45,816 --> 02:53:48,166
MARISHA: All right, well, it's a speech.

2114
02:53:48,166 --> 02:53:54,591
MATT: You can give the essence of it, but the idea
here is just you honing

2115
02:53:54,591 --> 02:53:56,310
your public speaking skills.

2116
02:53:56,310 --> 02:53:58,343
LAURA: You're going to get better at it, Keyleth.

2117
02:53:58,343 --> 02:54:00,633
LIAM: It's like public debate in high school.

2118
02:54:00,633 --> 02:54:01,911
SAM: Toastmasters.

2119
02:54:01,911 --> 02:54:04,304
TALIESIN: I love Toastmasters.

2120
02:54:04,304 --> 02:54:14,529
MATT: Temporary hit points. They last until
they're depleted or you finish a long rest. Yes, I

2121
02:54:14,529 --> 02:54:16,009
was correct. Cool.

2122
02:54:16,009 --> 02:54:17,355
MARISHA: So in the top of the morning.

2123
02:54:17,355 --> 02:54:19,126
LAURA and MARISHA: Top o' the mornin'!

2124
02:54:19,126 --> 02:54:24,626
MATT: All right. We'll say for the purpose of
brevity, because even at your guys' level if you

2125
02:54:24,626 --> 02:54:31,416
did encounter anything in this forest that was
indigenous, you'd splatter it in a round. But you

2126
02:54:31,416 --> 02:54:34,939
don't have any issues. Nothing really sees you up
in the branches. You occasionally get caught off

2127
02:54:34,939 --> 02:54:42,665
guard by the sound of a nearby (hooting). It's an
owl in the trees. But nothing seems to bother you

2128
02:54:42,665 --> 02:54:47,849
during your evening slumber. You complete your
long rest. You still maintain your benefits from

2129
02:54:47,849 --> 02:54:50,741
the Heroes' Feast, and as morning comes, Keyleth
gives a rousing speech.

2130
02:54:50,741 --> 02:54:55,476
SAM: Just give us a topic.

2131
02:54:55,476 --> 02:54:59,311
MATT: You can just describe the topics you talk
about. You don't have to give the actual speech.

2132
02:54:59,311 --> 02:55:11,198
MARISHA: That's great, because one can only
bullshit so much in a four-hour fucking game. I

2133
02:55:11,198 --> 02:55:20,202
talk about the smell of our breakfast. It's bacon
in the morning. And taste and smell the fleshy

2134
02:55:20,202 --> 02:55:22,417
essence of the pork.

2135
02:55:22,417 --> 02:55:25,053
TALIESIN: Is bacon what we're fighting for?

2136
02:55:25,053 --> 02:55:37,800
MARISHA: No, bacon is definitely worth fighting
for. Bacon is worth fighting for, and when we kill

2137
02:55:37,800 --> 02:55:47,368
that celestial baby we will have the godliest
bacon one could ever imagine.

2138
02:55:47,368 --> 02:55:49,174
SAM: I do like bacon.

2139
02:55:49,174 --> 02:55:54,264
TALIESIN: This is the most Burning Man thing
that's ever happened on this show.

2140
02:55:54,264 --> 02:55:58,196
I'm flashing back.

2141
02:55:58,196 --> 02:56:02,127
MATT: Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest.

2142
02:56:02,127 --> 02:56:05,372
TALIESIN: Bacon. Speech.

2143
02:56:05,372 --> 02:56:08,318
MATT: All right, guys. There you go. Take your 17
temporary hit points.

2144
02:56:08,318 --> 02:56:13,250
MARISHA: She's not a great talker and has never
been one. Just want to point that out. You guys

2145
02:56:13,250 --> 02:56:14,591
all know this.

2146
02:56:14,591 --> 02:56:16,120
MATT: No, it's just her level.

2147
02:56:16,120 --> 02:56:18,954
LAURA: Just add that to the 19 then?

2148
02:56:18,954 --> 02:56:22,192
MATT: No, because the 17, once the 17 goes it's
gone.

2149
02:56:22,192 --> 02:56:23,541
LAURA: But the 19 we can heal to?

2150
02:56:23,541 --> 02:56:26,572
MATT: It's still your maximum. You can heal to it,
yeah. That is the difference.

2151
02:56:26,572 --> 02:56:33,808
TALIESIN: I always imagine occasionally Keyleth
gives a speech that's like what's-his-name from

2152
02:56:33,808 --> 02:56:35,210
Animal House.

2153
02:56:35,210 --> 02:56:41,414
SAM: Matthew, I'm going to prepare some spells
that I'm going to inject into various coins.

2154
02:56:41,414 --> 02:56:42,826
MATT: Yes, what are you doing?

2155
02:56:42,826 --> 02:56:49,012
SAM: I'm going to drop another 300 gold and give
Vex another Revivify.

2156
02:56:49,012 --> 02:56:50,677
MATT: Okay.

2157
02:56:50,677 --> 02:56:55,595
SAM: Grog, you're already a good jumper, right?

2158
02:56:55,595 --> 02:56:56,936
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2159
02:56:56,936 --> 02:56:59,031
SAM: How far can you jump?

2160
02:56:59,031 --> 02:57:02,661
TRAVIS: You gave me a Fly coin.

2161
02:57:02,661 --> 02:57:08,699
SAM: No, that's gone forever. That's gone. It
doesn't last forever. It lasts a couple hours.

2162
02:57:08,699 --> 02:57:16,631
TRAVIS: Well, that's bullshit. Yeah, I can jump 15
feet vertically or 20 feet horizontally. So not

2163
02:57:16,631 --> 02:57:18,664
great. Like three squares.

2164
02:57:18,664 --> 02:57:23,712
SAM: I'll give you a Jump coin, so that will
triple your jump.

2165
02:57:23,712 --> 02:57:28,328
TRAVIS: Will you sing "Jump" from Van Halen?

2166
02:57:28,328 --> 02:57:35,931
SAM: Sure. When you do it. Let's see here. Who
needs things?

2167
02:57:35,931 --> 02:57:39,628
ASHLEY: (singing) Jump! For my love.

2168
02:57:39,628 --> 02:57:43,106
SAM: Oh no, you guys all cast things now, right?

2169
02:57:43,106 --> 02:57:45,009
TALIESIN: Not really, why?

2170
02:57:45,009 --> 02:57:50,363
LIAM: T., give me something! Show me some magic.
Give me a doodad.

2171
02:57:50,363 --> 02:57:52,036
SAM: Can you turn invisible?

2172
02:57:52,036 --> 02:57:54,056
LIAM: I used to be able to, but I--

2173
02:57:54,056 --> 02:57:55,452
SAM: You gave away your ring.

2174
02:57:55,452 --> 02:58:02,100
LAURA: Kerr bear. Oh no, it wasn't Kerr bear. It
was Tova.

2175
02:58:02,100 --> 02:58:04,792
SAM: I'll give you a Blur coin.

2176
02:58:04,792 --> 02:58:07,677
LAURA: Don't you already have that with your--

2177
02:58:07,677 --> 02:58:10,123
LIAM: That cloak that I gave away?

2178
02:58:10,123 --> 02:58:11,611
LAURA: Oh yeah, that one.

2179
02:58:11,611 --> 02:58:12,920
MARISHA: That's the one that Kerr bear took.

2180
02:58:12,920 --> 02:58:14,360
LIAM and LAURA: That's right.

2181
02:58:14,360 --> 02:58:17,681
MATT: Yeah. (laughs) The inventory of the items
you've lost to guests.

2182
02:58:17,681 --> 02:58:19,410
LIAM: Lost? Gave away.

2183
02:58:19,410 --> 02:58:20,939
MATT: Lost and gave away.

2184
02:58:20,939 --> 02:58:26,390
SAM: I'll give good old Percival a Cure Wounds
coin.

2185
02:58:26,390 --> 02:58:27,955
MATT: What level?

2186
02:58:27,955 --> 02:58:29,627
SAM: Just one.

2187
02:58:29,627 --> 02:58:30,893
MATT: Level one. You got it.

2188
02:58:30,893 --> 02:58:33,914
TALIESIN: Yeah. It will hopefully not come in
handy.

2189
02:58:33,914 --> 02:58:41,334
SAM: And also I'm going to change my Robe of Many
Things to my new Robe of Many Things.

2190
02:58:41,334 --> 02:58:43,331
MATT: Okay.

2191
02:58:43,331 --> 02:58:44,732
SAM: And that's it.

2192
02:58:44,732 --> 02:58:46,793
TALIESIN: A Vest of Several Items now.

2193
02:58:46,793 --> 02:58:52,775
MATT: (laughs) The Kigurumi of Useful Trinkets.

2194
02:58:52,775 --> 02:58:56,843
LAURA: Oh, hey. Well, no. Maybe would this be a
bad idea?

2195
02:58:56,843 --> 02:58:59,933
To shoot an Oracle Arrow down into the bottom?

2196
02:58:59,933 --> 02:59:08,375
TALIESIN: I think that's been working out very
well for us. It is pitch black down there,

2197
02:59:08,375 --> 02:59:09,762
though, isn't it?

2198
02:59:09,762 --> 02:59:16,897
LAURA: Well. We have this method that we used to
do. Light the arrow on fire, and then send it

2199
02:59:16,897 --> 02:59:20,033
down. So I can see by the light of the fire on
it.

2200
02:59:20,033 --> 02:59:21,862
LIAM: Would that make your actual eyeballs burn?

2201
02:59:21,862 --> 02:59:23,052
LAURA: I don't think so.

2202
02:59:23,052 --> 02:59:29,125
SAM: Oh! And I'm going to do one more thing. I'm
going to pull out a healing draught bottle, and

2203
02:59:29,125 --> 02:59:31,833
give it to-- no, you can heal things.

2204
02:59:31,833 --> 02:59:34,672
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm all right.

2205
02:59:34,672 --> 02:59:35,870
SAM: You don't need to heal.

2206
02:59:35,870 --> 02:59:37,935
TRAVIS: Other people, I normally do.

2207
02:59:37,935 --> 02:59:39,304
SAM: I give it to Vax.

2208
02:59:39,304 --> 02:59:42,108
TRAVIS: I turn into Nurse Betty almost in every
fight. What are you talking about?

2209
02:59:42,108 --> 02:59:43,861
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's actually true.

2210
02:59:43,861 --> 02:59:46,164
LAURA: That's true, he does. He does heal people a
lot.

2211
02:59:46,164 --> 02:59:49,016
TRAVIS: But that's cool, you give it to somebody
that, you know--

2212
02:59:49,016 --> 02:59:51,879
LIAM: Well, he can give it to me. I've got 50
things I can do a turn.

2213
02:59:51,879 --> 02:59:53,618
It was what kind of potion?

2214
02:59:53,618 --> 02:59:57,120
SAM: A healing draught. It's not a potion; it's a
bottle of healing shit.

2215
02:59:57,120 --> 02:59:58,425
LIAM: Oh shit.

2216
02:59:58,425 --> 02:59:59,617
SAM: It's 8d8.

2217
02:59:59,617 --> 03:00:01,805
ASHLEY and LIAM: 8d8?!

2218
03:00:01,805 --> 03:00:07,628
LIAM: I will never give this up. Ever. Thank you.
Thank you, Taryon.

2219
03:00:07,628 --> 03:00:09,441
SAM: Sure.

2220
03:00:09,441 --> 03:00:14,956
TALIESIN: I think that that's a really good idea,
shooting an arrow down there.

2221
03:00:15,043 --> 03:00:18,976
LIAM: I'm going to set the Deathwalker's Ward to
necrotic.

2222
03:00:18,976 --> 03:00:26,376
MARISHA: I'll light my hands on fire so that Vex
can light her arrows on fire.

2223
03:00:26,376 --> 03:00:30,532
TALIESIN: So when we're ready we've got something
to light the--

2224
03:00:30,532 --> 03:00:36,447
LAURA: Wait, should I cast Pass Without a Trace on
us? No, I'm going to do the Oracle Arrow first.

2225
03:00:36,447 --> 03:00:39,658
Oh. What if we wake it up when I shoot it down and
things come out?

2226
03:00:39,658 --> 03:00:42,344
LIAM: Well, that is a very real possibility.

2227
03:00:42,344 --> 03:00:45,156
TALIESIN: Well, then they'll be easier to kill up
here than they will be down there.

2228
03:00:45,156 --> 03:00:50,145
MARISHA: They'll be 400 meters down. I could
theoretically drop some awesome Fireballs on their

2229
03:00:50,221 --> 03:00:51,268
face, potentially.

2230
03:00:51,268 --> 03:00:55,770
LAURA: I like this idea. I'm going to cast Pass
Without a Trace on all of us, just to be safe. So

2231
03:00:55,770 --> 03:01:00,610
we can stealth and be quiet. Yeah, but they'll
just keep falling, won't they?

2232
03:01:00,610 --> 03:01:02,664
MARISHA: I don't know.

2233
03:01:02,664 --> 03:01:04,241
LAURA: How does that work?

2234
03:01:04,241 --> 03:01:05,987
MARISHA: That's a weird magic question.

2235
03:01:05,987 --> 03:01:07,727
TALIESIN: This is why magic freaks me out.

2236
03:01:07,727 --> 03:01:09,360
MATT: What's the question?

2237
03:01:09,360 --> 03:01:14,550
MARISHA: If I drop a Fireball, how long it'll
go--

2238
03:01:14,550 --> 03:01:16,673
LIAM: Does gravity continue to carry it down?

2239
03:01:16,673 --> 03:01:18,419
MATT: Drop a what? A Fireball?

2240
03:01:18,419 --> 03:01:22,478
TALIESIN: Fire a Fireball into the abyss. Will it
just eventually stop?

2241
03:01:22,478 --> 03:01:24,172
MARISHA: Will it keep going?

2242
03:01:24,172 --> 03:01:31,271
MATT: Well, a Fireball is a small bead of magic
energy that has a range. So if it reaches the end

2243
03:01:31,271 --> 03:01:32,778
of the range, it has no effect.

2244
03:01:32,778 --> 03:01:35,122
TALIESIN: This is why magic's weird.

2245
03:01:35,122 --> 03:01:37,022
MARISHA: But I could Keyteor to the bottom.

2246
03:01:37,022 --> 03:01:38,175
MATT: You could.

2247
03:01:38,175 --> 03:01:40,577
TRAVIS: We're just spoiled for choice.

2248
03:01:40,577 --> 03:01:43,031
MATT: You take half bludgeoning damage when you
impact.

2249
03:01:43,031 --> 03:01:44,656
MARISHA: Yep, advantages to both.

2250
03:01:44,656 --> 03:01:47,031
LIAM: Dropping a great height did not go well for
you.

2251
03:01:47,031 --> 03:01:51,375
TRAVIS: Keyleth, did you roll 17 or 19 on your--

2252
03:01:51,375 --> 03:01:55,418
MARISHA: I rolled 19, but then you get an
additional 17 because

2253
03:01:55,418 --> 03:01:59,417
my weird speech about bacon.

2254
03:01:59,417 --> 03:02:04,224
MATT: Bacon points. 17 bacon points.

2255
03:02:04,224 --> 03:02:07,653
LAURA: It will make the most glorious bacon!

2256
03:02:07,653 --> 03:02:10,616
MATT: To be fair, I've eaten some bacon in my time
that's given me some temporary hit points.

2257
03:02:10,616 --> 03:02:12,520
Just saying.

2258
03:02:12,520 --> 03:02:16,379
MARISHA: Look, it was inspired, okay?

2259
03:02:16,379 --> 03:02:17,736
MATT: Oh, completely.

2260
03:02:17,736 --> 03:02:19,074
MARISHA: I'm not wrong.

2261
03:02:19,074 --> 03:02:21,569
LIAM: We will not go bacon-less into the night.

2262
03:02:21,569 --> 03:02:24,652
MARISHA: Bacon has saved many a people.

2263
03:02:24,652 --> 03:02:33,218
LAURA: All right. I'm setting my arrow on fire,
and I'm shooting it down into the pit.

2264
03:02:33,218 --> 03:02:40,438
MATT: Okay. Oracle Arrow. You fire it. It's a big
pit. The radius of a small flame on an arrow

2265
03:02:40,438 --> 03:02:47,661
doesn't seem to light up the walls. It's not
bright enough, so it just descends and descends,

2266
03:02:47,661 --> 03:02:55,785
and the wood is catching and burning, and
eventually it hits the stony, earthy floor at the

2267
03:02:55,785 --> 03:03:01,231
bottom (arrow impact) and it clatters and breaks a
little bit. It's burning pretty heavily, and you

2268
03:03:01,231 --> 03:03:06,498
glance around the space inside and you can see
what looks like some broken mining equipment on

2269
03:03:06,498 --> 03:03:12,474
the ground, jutting out in places. You see what
appears to be some sort of stony platform that is

2270
03:03:12,474 --> 03:03:23,260
carved, but mildly forgotten or eroded steps, and
the rest of the arrow burns up

2271
03:03:23,260 --> 03:03:25,358
and you lose your vision.

2272
03:03:25,358 --> 03:03:27,918
LAURA: That was helpful. Super helpful.

2273
03:03:27,918 --> 03:03:33,320
TALIESIN: Worth it. It was worth it. It didn't
cost us anything.

2274
03:03:33,320 --> 03:03:37,519
LAURA: That's true. I didn't see the great baby
beast down at the bottom.

2275
03:03:37,519 --> 03:03:40,583
TALIESIN: And that's information we didn't have.
And now we know.

2276
03:03:40,583 --> 03:03:43,173
Great baby beast is not at the bottom--

2277
03:03:43,173 --> 03:03:45,523
LAURA: Potentially. In that small circle.

2278
03:03:45,523 --> 03:03:47,449
TALIESIN: It's not at the bottom of the topless
pit.

2279
03:03:47,449 --> 03:03:58,360
LAURA: Okay, so we could take the flying carpet down. A
couple of people could fly. We can take the flying

2280
03:03:58,360 --> 03:03:59,685
carpet down.

2281
03:03:59,685 --> 03:04:01,785
TALIESIN: Two flyers, plus the carpet.

2282
03:04:01,785 --> 03:04:06,079
TRAVIS: The circumference of this thing is
massive. The diameter.

2283
03:04:06,079 --> 03:04:09,540
MATT: Well, the diameter of the actual hole is
maybe about--

2284
03:04:09,540 --> 03:04:14,381
TRAVIS: Football field?

2285
03:04:14,381 --> 03:04:21,767
MATT: Not quite that big. I'd say it's about 150,
200 feet across?

2286
03:04:21,767 --> 03:04:24,800
TRAVIS: Stay away from the walls.

2287
03:04:24,800 --> 03:04:29,934
LAURA: You think? The skitterers are going to come
out of the walls?

2288
03:04:29,934 --> 03:04:32,787
TRAVIS: Yeah, do not come anywhere near the
walls.

2289
03:04:32,787 --> 03:04:38,842
SAM: When we descend, do we want light to be able
to see? Or we don't want things to see us?

2290
03:04:38,842 --> 03:04:42,488
LIAM: Good chance they can see in the dark.

2291
03:04:42,488 --> 03:04:46,351
TALIESIN: Let's have the flashlights ready, but
not activated.

2292
03:04:46,351 --> 03:04:48,483
MARISHA: I mean, I have a few Daylight spells.

2293
03:04:48,531 --> 03:04:53,255
LAURA: It may be good to blind them if they dwell
under the surface.

2294
03:04:53,255 --> 03:04:58,393
TRAVIS: You know, if we're not in a rush--
(deeper) if we're not in a rush, it might just be

2295
03:04:58,393 --> 03:05:02,626
nice to send a little mini nuke down into the hole
and see what comes out.

2296
03:05:02,626 --> 03:05:03,995
TALIESIN: Did your voice just crack?

2297
03:05:03,995 --> 03:05:05,702
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, it's like reverse puberty.

2298
03:05:05,702 --> 03:05:07,326
TALIESIN: Becoming a man? Okay.

2299
03:05:07,326 --> 03:05:14,402
MARISHA: I'm down with that mini nuke. It extends
a lot of our magical ranges, unless I want to

2300
03:05:14,402 --> 03:05:16,251
Keyteor down.

2301
03:05:16,251 --> 03:05:21,531
TALIESIN: I think it's better, especially-- have
we seen a tree that we can port to in case of an

2302
03:05:21,531 --> 03:05:23,974
emergency? Or some sort of object that we can port
to?

2303
03:05:23,974 --> 03:05:26,246
MARISHA: There are definitely a lot of trees,
yeah.

2304
03:05:26,246 --> 03:05:29,102
TALIESIN: But there will not be a tree down
there.

2305
03:05:29,102 --> 03:05:30,366
LAURA and MATT: No.

2306
03:05:30,366 --> 03:05:33,569
TALIESIN: Do we have an escape route if we need
it?

2307
03:05:33,569 --> 03:05:41,395
LAURA: We have a flying carpet, two brooms, a set
of wings. Up and out.

2308
03:05:41,395 --> 03:05:43,143
TALIESIN: Well, all right.

2309
03:05:43,143 --> 03:05:46,208
TRAVIS: Just a reminder that I can't ride the
carpet.

2310
03:05:46,208 --> 03:05:48,122
LAURA: Yes, you can.

2311
03:05:48,122 --> 03:05:49,300
LIAM: It's a big one.

2312
03:05:49,300 --> 03:05:50,774
TRAVIS: Is it? Is it bigger than the first one?

2313
03:05:50,774 --> 03:05:52,581
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's bigger than the first one.

2314
03:05:52,581 --> 03:05:54,123
TRAVIS: So I can get on there with everybody
else?

2315
03:05:54,123 --> 03:06:00,348
LAURA: The only people we need to get on it are
Percy and Pike. Everybody else can fly. Unless

2316
03:06:00,348 --> 03:06:01,662
Keyleth is out of--

2317
03:06:01,662 --> 03:06:04,125
MARISHA: Well, I can Polymorph him.

2318
03:06:04,125 --> 03:06:08,452
TALIESIN: How much weight can the carpet take?

2319
03:06:08,452 --> 03:06:12,804
ASHLEY: I mean, you could technically just go on
it alone and I could--

2320
03:06:12,804 --> 03:06:14,040
LAURA: Hop on the broom.

2321
03:06:14,040 --> 03:06:15,738
LIAM: We are versatile as shit.

2322
03:06:15,738 --> 03:06:17,710
ASHLEY: Hop on Vax's back.

2323
03:06:17,710 --> 03:06:20,922
MATT: Okay, the flying carpet, the one that you
have? 800 pound capacity.

2324
03:06:20,922 --> 03:06:22,055
TRAVIS: Okay.

2325
03:06:22,055 --> 03:06:23,351
SAM: It's you, right?

2326
03:06:23,351 --> 03:06:25,834
TALIESIN: You're 300 pounds, right?

2327
03:06:25,834 --> 03:06:30,886
TRAVIS: No, I'm... it's arguable. I'm definitely
over 300.

2328
03:06:30,886 --> 03:06:37,539
TALIESIN: Okay, so three of us on that carpet: one
big one, one little one, and a medium.

2329
03:06:37,539 --> 03:06:39,603
MATT: You can fit Grog and one other person.

2330
03:06:39,603 --> 03:06:41,213
TRAVIS: He's a big bastard.

2331
03:06:41,213 --> 03:06:42,748
SAM: We can take someone on a broom.

2332
03:06:42,748 --> 03:06:43,863
LAURA: Yeah.

2333
03:06:43,927 --> 03:06:45,149
TALIESIN: I'll join you on the broom.

2334
03:06:45,149 --> 03:06:46,364
LAURA: All right.

2335
03:06:46,364 --> 03:06:49,666
MATT: I think you could probably fit Grog, Percy,
and Pike.

2336
03:06:49,666 --> 03:06:51,864
TALIESIN: Yeah, okay then. That solves it.

2337
03:06:51,864 --> 03:06:55,702
SAM: Well, then let's descend slowly and quietly?
Is that what we're doing?

2338
03:06:55,702 --> 03:07:00,932
MARISHA: Hang on. Before we go, there's a few
things I want to do. Let me double-check-- I don't

2339
03:07:00,932 --> 03:07:02,434
want to be a dumbass.

2340
03:07:02,434 --> 03:07:05,088
TALIESIN: No, this is very clever. I see what
you're going for.

2341
03:07:05,088 --> 03:07:14,188
MARISHA: Hang on. Wait. I might need the book.
Okay, one of the things I want to do is I want to

2342
03:07:14,188 --> 03:07:21,181
use my staff to create an air elemental? So I want
to take a minute to use my

2343
03:07:21,181 --> 03:07:26,633
Spire to conjure an air elemental.

2344
03:07:26,633 --> 03:07:31,675
MATT: Conjure an air elemental.

2345
03:07:31,675 --> 03:07:39,079
SAM: By the way, can I just remind everyone, this
whole year I've had one half of a communications

2346
03:07:39,079 --> 03:07:42,706
bracelet and someone's been watching us the whole
time.

2347
03:07:42,706 --> 03:07:43,791
TRAVIS: What?

2348
03:07:43,791 --> 03:07:45,185
SAM: Remember that thing I found?

2349
03:07:45,185 --> 03:07:47,182
LAURA: Because you got that down in the fucking
Nine Hells, right?

2350
03:07:47,182 --> 03:07:50,015
SAM: Yeah. Someone's watching us. For a year.

2351
03:07:50,015 --> 03:07:51,913
TALIESIN: Oh my god, they're right there.

2352
03:07:51,913 --> 03:07:53,112
LAURA: That is so crazy.

2353
03:07:53,112 --> 03:07:54,216
MARISHA: What?

2354
03:07:54,216 --> 03:07:59,960
TRAVIS: Yeah, watching you make fucking blondies.
All right, this channel's boring.

2355
03:07:59,960 --> 03:08:01,689
TALIESIN: The blondie channel.

2356
03:08:01,689 --> 03:08:03,952
TRAVIS: He's making armor. Ugh.

2357
03:08:03,952 --> 03:08:06,283
LIAM: (guttural, growly) I want a blondie so bad!

2358
03:08:06,283 --> 03:08:15,571
MARISHA: I'm going to conjure an air elemental,
and then I'm going to go over to Grog and I'm

2359
03:08:15,571 --> 03:08:27,416
going to give him a big hug and say, for the next
hour, no one can keep a hold of you. And I'm going

2360
03:08:27,416 --> 03:08:29,767
to give him Freedom of Movement.

2361
03:08:29,767 --> 03:08:31,733
TRAVIS: What is that?

2362
03:08:31,733 --> 03:08:37,279
TALIESIN: Target should now spend five feet of
movement to automatically escape from non-magical

2363
03:08:37,279 --> 03:08:40,454
restraints such as manacles or creatures that have
grapple.

2364
03:08:40,454 --> 03:08:41,864
MARISHA: You can't be grappled.

2365
03:08:41,864 --> 03:08:44,171
TRAVIS: So I just spend five feet of my movement?

2366
03:08:44,171 --> 03:08:51,615
MARISHA: You're also unaffected by difficult
terrain. And spells and other magical effects can

2367
03:08:51,615 --> 03:08:56,784
neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the
target to be paralyzed or restrained.

2368
03:08:56,784 --> 03:08:58,544
TALIESIN: You are parkour.

2369
03:08:58,544 --> 03:08:59,836
MARISHA: You're parkour.

2370
03:08:59,836 --> 03:09:01,482
TRAVIS: I'm Chevy Chase in Christmas Vacation.

2371
03:09:01,482 --> 03:09:04,673
MARISHA: Because I feel like you've been
restrained a lot.

2372
03:09:04,673 --> 03:09:07,682
MATT: As you finish the conjuration with the staff
and slam it into the ground at the edge of the

2373
03:09:07,682 --> 03:09:13,817
entranceway, you watch as a nearby cloud starts to
swirl and descend, and you hear this cracking

2374
03:09:13,817 --> 03:09:20,174
sound as the planar shift between your plane and
the Elemental Plane of Air briefly hiccups open

2375
03:09:20,174 --> 03:09:24,722
and then summons forth an air elemental that
(whoosh) rushes down under your control. It is

2376
03:09:24,722 --> 03:09:26,224
concentration. Keep that in mind.

2377
03:09:26,224 --> 03:09:27,412
MARISHA: Yes.

2378
03:09:27,412 --> 03:09:28,699
MATT: All righty.

2379
03:09:28,699 --> 03:09:29,944
TALIESIN: Let's go.

2380
03:09:29,944 --> 03:09:31,134
TRAVIS: Do it.

2381
03:09:31,134 --> 03:09:37,479
MATT: So. Two brooms of flying, magic carpet,
wings.

2382
03:09:37,479 --> 03:09:40,926
LAURA and TALIESIN: (singing) And a partridge in a
pear tree.

2383
03:09:40,926 --> 03:09:42,903
MATT: And you are...

2384
03:09:42,903 --> 03:09:49,469
MARISHA: I know. I'm wondering if I should ahead
and go elemental, but I can't cast. Can I get on

2385
03:09:49,469 --> 03:09:51,139
the carpet? Is there room?

2386
03:09:51,139 --> 03:09:52,511
MATT: The carpet's full.

2387
03:09:52,511 --> 03:09:54,941
TALIESIN: I'll hop on the broom. You hop on the
carpet.

2388
03:09:54,941 --> 03:09:57,987
MATT: Okay, we can do that. All right, so you guys
slowly begin to descend down

2389
03:09:57,987 --> 03:10:01,780
this heavy, open tunnel.

2390
03:10:01,780 --> 03:10:04,420
LAURA: This is just the stupidest. We're sticking
to the middle.

2391
03:10:04,420 --> 03:10:07,466
MARISHA: Did you cast Pass Without a Trace?

2392
03:10:07,466 --> 03:10:11,890
MATT: Yes. So I would like all you guys to make a
stealth check, please.

2393
03:10:11,953 --> 03:10:13,980
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

2394
03:10:13,980 --> 03:10:19,222
LAURA: Oh shit! Flying carpet! Ooh, shit, and add
ten, y'all.

2395
03:10:19,222 --> 03:10:20,719
TALIESIN: 27.

2396
03:10:20,719 --> 03:10:22,014
SAM: 21.

2397
03:10:22,014 --> 03:10:24,529
LIAM: I rolled a two, but it's a 37.

2398
03:10:24,529 --> 03:10:26,291
ASHLEY: That's ridiculous.

2399
03:10:26,291 --> 03:10:27,800
LAURA: 39.

2400
03:10:27,800 --> 03:10:30,287
LIAM: Built into the rules, man!

2401
03:10:30,287 --> 03:10:34,810
MATT: Yep, reliable rogues, man. That's what
rogues are good at.

2402
03:10:34,810 --> 03:10:36,678
MARISHA: 37.

2403
03:10:36,678 --> 03:10:38,225
ASHLEY: 28!

2404
03:10:38,225 --> 03:10:39,324
TRAVIS: 30.

2405
03:10:39,324 --> 03:10:45,075
MATT: 30, okay! As you guys all descend, you get
about halfway down the tunnel, and you can hear

2406
03:10:45,075 --> 03:10:51,072
this occasional echo (clicking). And for those of
you that have Darkvision, you look off to the side

2407
03:10:51,072 --> 03:10:58,506
and you see there are these small openings, these
tunnels in the sides, and occasionally you see a

2408
03:10:58,506 --> 03:11:05,395
large insect-like creature skitter out (clicking)
and then into another hole. None seem to see or

2409
03:11:05,395 --> 03:11:11,052
notice your presence. You continue delving deeper
and deeper and deeper. Looking up above, you can

2410
03:11:11,052 --> 03:11:23,342
see the slowly vanishing circle of daylight above
you, and as you continue further and further down,

2411
03:11:23,342 --> 03:11:31,223
those of you with Darkvision, you begin to see a
floor begin to approach.

2412
03:11:31,223 --> 03:11:33,309
SAM: Don't land?

2413
03:11:33,309 --> 03:11:34,940
LAURA: Don't land.

2414
03:11:34,940 --> 03:11:36,322
SAM: Do we need light?

2415
03:11:36,322 --> 03:11:41,511
TRAVIS: No, not yet. I halt the carpet 20 feet off
the ground.

2416
03:11:41,511 --> 03:11:43,139
MATT: Okay. You halt the carpet.

2417
03:11:43,139 --> 03:11:47,000
LAURA: And we're whispering. We're whispering, but
we're not whispering so that people can hear.

2418
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:49,720
We're definitely whispering over--

2419
03:11:49,720 --> 03:11:55,707
ASHLEY: Can we see any little creature in the
middle of anything?

2420
03:11:55,707 --> 03:11:57,957
MATT: Make a perception check.

2421
03:11:57,957 --> 03:12:00,098
LAURA: Can I look, too?

2422
03:12:00,098 --> 03:12:07,402
SAM: I have some sort of a cloak over my helm,
since it emits light always.

2423
03:12:07,402 --> 03:12:14,709
MATT: Okay. It doesn't block all the light because
it's the Helm of Brilliance. As you guys are being

2424
03:12:14,709 --> 03:12:20,015
somewhat stealthy going down here, Taryon is still
a slight beacon of fire. His helmet just emits a

2425
03:12:20,015 --> 03:12:21,669
glow at all times.

2426
03:12:21,669 --> 03:12:27,479
TRAVIS: Cool. Because insects don't love lights in
the dark.

2427
03:12:27,479 --> 03:12:29,576
MARISHA: I know.

2428
03:12:29,576 --> 03:12:31,691
ASHLEY: 25 for perception.

2429
03:12:31,691 --> 03:12:32,856
LAURA: 22.

2430
03:12:32,856 --> 03:12:39,096
MATT: Okay. You glance about and you can see this
opening at the bottom. There's some warping to the

2431
03:12:39,096 --> 03:12:44,409
earth here. It's one large chamber that's almost
peanut-shaped, it pinches in the center and closes

2432
03:12:44,453 --> 03:12:49,964
around, and there's a small tunnel that leads off
and then closes at the end. It appears to be what

2433
03:12:49,964 --> 03:12:53,835
may have been some sort of mine shaft that has
then collapsed on the opposite side, but the

2434
03:12:53,835 --> 03:13:03,283
center here looks like there's some fallen barrels
and chest pieces, and there are pieces of rods and

2435
03:13:03,283 --> 03:13:09,849
rope and cords strewn about. And there's this
ancient stone platform that rises up in the

2436
03:13:09,849 --> 03:13:15,835
center, and what appears to be some sort of a
small recess in the stonework there. It looks like

2437
03:13:15,835 --> 03:13:20,856
it's the size of a football carved downward.

2438
03:13:20,856 --> 03:13:28,074
SAM: I was wrong. It only emits light when there's
undead around.

2439
03:13:28,074 --> 03:13:29,357
MATT: Oh.

2440
03:13:29,357 --> 03:13:33,275
LAURA: Is it emitting light? Is it like an orc?

2441
03:13:33,275 --> 03:13:35,263
MATT: It is currently not emitting light.

2442
03:13:35,263 --> 03:13:37,672
LAURA: Should we just nuke it? Should we just nuke
that thing?

2443
03:13:37,672 --> 03:13:41,586
TRAVIS: The ancient platform? No, don't do that.

2444
03:13:41,586 --> 03:13:44,020
LAURA: Oh, it was like a coffin. Does it look like
a coffin?

2445
03:13:44,020 --> 03:13:47,330
MATT: You could probably get closer.

2446
03:13:47,330 --> 03:13:48,770
TALIESIN: Let's get a little closer.

2447
03:13:48,770 --> 03:13:50,089
LAURA: A teeny bit.

2448
03:13:50,089 --> 03:13:53,495
MATT: Okay. Because you're a ways from it and you
have no light down here. Even with your

2449
03:13:53,495 --> 03:14:03,685
Darkvision, you can make out some details. The
closer you get, you see a number of small carvings

2450
03:14:03,685 --> 03:14:07,980
in what looks like some sort of language that I
don't believe you understand.

2451
03:14:07,980 --> 03:14:09,314
TALIESIN: Celestial?

2452
03:14:09,314 --> 03:14:11,571
MATT: You don't see it. It's pitch-black for you,
Mr. Human.

2453
03:14:11,571 --> 03:14:13,053
LAURA: Abyssal? Draconic?

2454
03:14:13,128 --> 03:14:14,040
MATT: Nope.

2455
03:14:14,040 --> 03:14:15,069
MARISHA: Primordial?

2456
03:14:15,069 --> 03:14:16,397
MATT: Nope.

2457
03:14:16,397 --> 03:14:18,265
TRAVIS: Common.

2458
03:14:18,265 --> 03:14:20,638
MATT: Nope!

2459
03:14:20,638 --> 03:14:22,781
TALIESIN: That would be amazing.

2460
03:14:22,781 --> 03:14:24,608
ASHLEY: Dwarvish. Gnomish.

2461
03:14:24,608 --> 03:14:25,776
MATT: Nope.

2462
03:14:25,776 --> 03:14:26,760
TRAVIS: Giant?

2463
03:14:26,760 --> 03:14:28,911
LAURA: Yeah, they're human. They can't see shit.

2464
03:14:28,911 --> 03:14:32,860
MATT: The humans are sitting there in pitch black,
seeing this tiny little bead of light above and

2465
03:14:32,860 --> 03:14:36,527
just hoping that someone's going to give them some
indicator.

2466
03:14:36,527 --> 03:14:48,624
LAURA: Should we cast some light down here?

2467
03:14:48,624 --> 03:14:54,955
SAM: Sure. We said that we had prepared our
flashlights before, didn't we?

2468
03:14:54,955 --> 03:14:59,928
TALIESIN: Oh, we have that low-light version! We
have the red-light version of it.

2469
03:14:59,928 --> 03:15:03,220
SAM: Yes, we do. I'm going to mark off two of
these.

2470
03:15:03,283 --> 03:15:06,313
LIAM: I can get around very fast. Why don't I go
look?

2471
03:15:06,313 --> 03:15:08,674
SAM: You want to borrow a flashlight?

2472
03:15:08,674 --> 03:15:10,421
LIAM: I have a flashlight.

2473
03:15:10,421 --> 03:15:13,018
TALIESIN: You don't speak Celestial.

2474
03:15:13,018 --> 03:15:14,664
MARISHA: I can also just cast Daylight, by the
by.

2475
03:15:14,732 --> 03:15:18,033
SAM: Well, that's what we have going in our
flashlights, are Daylight spells.

2476
03:15:18,033 --> 03:15:20,836
TALIESIN: Except they're lensed and contained.

2477
03:15:20,836 --> 03:15:23,129
MATT: It's contained, but it's still a single
beam.

2478
03:15:23,129 --> 03:15:25,145
TALIESIN: A beam of red light.

2479
03:15:25,145 --> 03:15:29,669
MATT: So you go ahead and get close on the broom.

2480
03:15:29,669 --> 03:15:32,819
TALIESIN: And just start to see if I can make out
what it is.

2481
03:15:32,819 --> 03:15:39,287
MATT: Right. You open up the hood of the light,
and it immediately beams this stark red beam down

2482
03:15:39,287 --> 03:15:41,496
on this portion, and you look at it. It is
Celestial.

2483
03:15:41,496 --> 03:15:43,261
TALIESIN: What does it say?

2484
03:15:43,261 --> 03:15:57,940
MATT: It appears to be runes of gestation and
protection. It speaks of a seed, a guardian for

2485
03:15:57,940 --> 03:16:00,994
ages to come: Symphior.

2486
03:16:00,994 --> 03:16:03,276
ALL: Symphior.

2487
03:16:03,276 --> 03:16:12,849
TALIESIN: It's an incubator. This isn't a coffin.
It hatched.

2488
03:16:12,849 --> 03:16:17,431
ASHLEY: So this is the opening of-- this is where
it was.

2489
03:16:17,431 --> 03:16:19,581
LIAM: Is it a guard cherub?

2490
03:16:19,581 --> 03:16:26,202
MATT: You notice as this pale white light begins
to slowly appear a little ways ahead of you in the

2491
03:16:26,202 --> 03:16:29,877
other side of the chamber. This light is emanating
from some--

2492
03:16:29,877 --> 03:16:33,293
TALIESIN: I snuff. The second.

2493
03:16:33,293 --> 03:16:35,229
LAURA: And we back away from the thing.

2494
03:16:35,229 --> 03:16:40,811
MATT: You guys begin to drift back on the carpet,
and you see this beacon of light hovering maybe

2495
03:16:40,811 --> 03:16:46,643
ten feet up off the ground, about the same height
that you guys were to the platform. And you see

2496
03:16:46,643 --> 03:16:57,146
there what appears to be a cherub. It's a baby, or
an infant, but it appears to be withered and gray,

2497
03:16:57,146 --> 03:17:02,542
and its arms and legs hang limply, and it has
these small, white angel-like wings, but the

2498
03:17:02,542 --> 03:17:09,221
feathers are tattered and broken in places, and
the head's lolled back, and as the glow grows from

2499
03:17:09,221 --> 03:17:18,840
it, it goes (wheezes, screams) and gives out this
heinous scream that echoes throughout the whole

2500
03:17:18,840 --> 03:17:22,759
hall. You can't help but instinctually grab your
ears. I would like you all to make a wisdom saving

2501
03:17:22,759 --> 03:17:23,950
throw, please.

2502
03:17:23,950 --> 03:17:26,125
LAURA: Advantage on!

2503
03:17:26,125 --> 03:17:32,544
MATT: Which, actually, you are immune to fear, so
it does not affect you. However, it shakes the

2504
03:17:32,544 --> 03:17:38,867
interior and you watch as small stones (thud)
hitting the ground around you. You guys, looking

2505
03:17:38,867 --> 03:17:44,958
up above, you can see that this scream is
affecting the structure a little bit. I need you

2506
03:17:44,958 --> 03:17:47,142
all to roll initiative.

2507
03:17:47,142 --> 03:17:51,290
MARISHA: Oh, that's good!

2508
03:17:51,290 --> 03:17:54,862
SAM: Oh, that sucks.

2509
03:17:54,862 --> 03:17:56,658
LAURA: Oh shit.

2510
03:17:56,658 --> 03:18:00,115
MATT: So we have, up here by the platform.

2511
03:18:00,115 --> 03:18:10,637
LIAM: I rolled a 20 on the wisdom save we didn't
need to make, and threw it away, and thought,

2512
03:18:10,637 --> 03:18:13,498
"well, I wanted to keep it," and then I rolled
again and I got another natural 20.

2513
03:18:13,498 --> 03:18:15,026
MARISHA: Oh shit.

2514
03:18:15,026 --> 03:18:17,087
SAM: Whoa, look at that! There's a map.

2515
03:18:17,087 --> 03:18:23,974
LAURA: Wow, it's cool-looking! Oh shit, we're
right by the baby.

2516
03:18:23,974 --> 03:18:25,439
LIAM: Where's the baby?

2517
03:18:25,439 --> 03:18:27,534
MATT: There it is.

2518
03:18:27,534 --> 03:18:29,119
LAURA: Oh, that's the baby?

2519
03:18:29,119 --> 03:18:30,684
MATT: It's very tiny.

2520
03:18:30,684 --> 03:18:36,568
LAURA: Oh, it's a mean baby. I feel like it could
be saved, because it's--

2521
03:18:36,568 --> 03:18:40,803
LIAM: When you say saved, do you mean killed?

2522
03:18:40,803 --> 03:18:43,486
LAURA: I feel bad because it's a baby.

2523
03:18:43,486 --> 03:18:50,121
MATT: All right. Initiatives. 25 to 20, anybody?

2524
03:18:50,121 --> 03:18:51,668
LIAM: 25.

2525
03:18:51,668 --> 03:18:53,174
MARISHA: Holy shit.

2526
03:18:53,174 --> 03:18:54,518
MATT: Who rolled what?

2527
03:18:54,518 --> 03:18:55,543
TALIESIN: 30.

2528
03:18:55,543 --> 03:18:56,899
MATT: Jesus Christ, Percy.

2529
03:18:56,899 --> 03:18:58,051
LIAM: So what did you roll?

2530
03:18:58,051 --> 03:19:00,647
TALIESIN: I rolled a 19, and my initiative is 11.

2531
03:19:00,647 --> 03:19:01,877
ASHLEY: Jeez.

2532
03:19:01,877 --> 03:19:03,413
LIAM: Wow.

2533
03:19:03,413 --> 03:19:08,785
TALIESIN: I am going to debate hard how dumb I'm
about to be.

2534
03:19:08,785 --> 03:19:11,426
LIAM: The dumbest.

2535
03:19:11,426 --> 03:19:15,526
MATT: All right. So 20 to 15.

2536
03:19:15,526 --> 03:19:16,727
ASHLEY: 20.

2537
03:19:16,727 --> 03:19:18,506
MARISHA: 19.

2538
03:19:18,506 --> 03:19:20,302
ASHLEY: What did you get?

2539
03:19:20,302 --> 03:19:21,594
LIAM: 25.

2540
03:19:21,594 --> 03:19:23,427
ASHLEY: You got a 25, okay.

2541
03:19:23,427 --> 03:19:24,890
MATT: All right. 15 to 10?

2542
03:19:24,890 --> 03:19:26,084
LAURA: 12.

2543
03:19:26,084 --> 03:19:28,429
MATT: Ten to five.

2544
03:19:28,429 --> 03:19:29,878
SAM: Oh yeah.

2545
03:19:29,878 --> 03:19:30,896
TRAVIS: Eight.

2546
03:19:30,896 --> 03:19:31,946
SAM: Six.

2547
03:19:31,946 --> 03:19:38,549
MATT: All righty. All right, guys, we're going to
keep this coming at everyone fast, because we're

2548
03:19:38,549 --> 03:19:43,890
going to make this happen. All right, first and
foremost, as this creature emerges and you guys

2549
03:19:43,890 --> 03:19:47,231
are in your respective places, Percival, you're up
first.

2550
03:19:47,231 --> 03:19:48,707
TALIESIN: Where am I?

2551
03:19:48,707 --> 03:19:51,494
MATT: You're up here near the top of the platform,
where you saw the recess.

2552
03:19:51,494 --> 03:19:54,681
TALIESIN: Goddamn it! Okay, so I'm far away from
that little bugger, aren't I?

2553
03:19:54,681 --> 03:19:59,180
MATT: Yeah, it appeared on the opposite side of
this double chamber. It's all up from there.

2554
03:19:59,180 --> 03:20:03,988
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to hop off the broom.

2555
03:20:03,988 --> 03:20:06,224
MATT: Okay. So you hop off of there.

2556
03:20:06,224 --> 03:20:09,827
TALIESIN: Actually, no. You're going to move
towards it, I assume?

2557
03:20:09,827 --> 03:20:12,772
LAURA: I'm so far below you in the initiative,
though.

2558
03:20:12,772 --> 03:20:14,183
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fair.

2559
03:20:14,183 --> 03:20:20,816
SAM: It's glowing, right, so we can see it even if
we don't turn on flashlights and things?

2560
03:20:20,816 --> 03:20:24,598
MATT: You can see it, yes, but you cannot see the
terrain around you.

2561
03:20:24,598 --> 03:20:26,575
TRAVIS: I'm sure we're going to try and talk to
it, right?

2562
03:20:26,575 --> 03:20:29,909
SAM: Yeah. Maybe it knows my family's name.

2563
03:20:29,909 --> 03:20:32,978
MATT: So Percival, what are you doing?

2564
03:20:32,978 --> 03:20:46,163
TALIESIN: I'm going to hop off the broom, activate
my boots and activate my gloves, and start running

2565
03:20:46,163 --> 03:20:55,600
through that little choke point, and I'm going to
get as close to and possibly on the wall of that

2566
03:20:55,600 --> 03:20:58,591
choke point as humanly possible. The other side of
the choke point.

2567
03:20:58,591 --> 03:21:01,744
MATT: Oh, this side? You can get about there. You
don't quite get to the wall.

2568
03:21:01,744 --> 03:21:03,697
TALIESIN: Okay. I can get about there?

2569
03:21:03,697 --> 03:21:06,431
MATT: You can get further, but currently the
creature is out of your view.

2570
03:21:06,431 --> 03:21:12,677
TALIESIN: That's fine. That's as far as I can get
right now. That will be just fine. The gloves are

2571
03:21:12,677 --> 03:21:15,890
charged, the boots are on, and I'm heading towards
the wall.

2572
03:21:15,890 --> 03:21:17,128
MATT: Okay. That's your turn?

2573
03:21:17,128 --> 03:21:18,229
TALIESIN: Yep.

2574
03:21:18,229 --> 03:21:19,539
MATT: All right. Vax?

2575
03:21:19,539 --> 03:21:25,822
LIAM: Okay. Boots on, I'm going to arc over to ten
feet away from the baby.

2576
03:21:25,822 --> 03:21:28,485
MATT: All right. About there?

2577
03:21:28,485 --> 03:21:33,318
LIAM: Yeah. Where I am, is it straight up, or am I
covered over here?

2578
03:21:33,318 --> 03:21:38,286
MATT: It's straight up. Where you see the walls
are right now, even this is collapsed about here.

2579
03:21:38,286 --> 03:21:45,536
In fact, I'd say, to keep it easier, I'll say
that's a collapsed entrance there. But this is all

2580
03:21:45,536 --> 03:21:49,921
a straight-up hole in the ground. It slowly
funnels as it gets to the bottom.

2581
03:21:49,921 --> 03:21:51,466
LAURA: Whoa.

2582
03:21:51,466 --> 03:22:02,409
LIAM: All right. So action, action, bonus action.
I'm going to cast Vow of Enmity on it.

2583
03:22:02,409 --> 03:22:04,099
MATT: All righty.

2584
03:22:04,099 --> 03:22:06,605
LIAM: Then I'm going to throw Whisper at it.

2585
03:22:06,605 --> 03:22:08,178
MATT: All righty.

2586
03:22:08,178 --> 03:22:12,526
LIAM: That is a 33 to hit.

2587
03:22:12,526 --> 03:22:13,720
MATT: That hits.

2588
03:22:13,720 --> 03:22:16,362
LIAM: I'm going to cast Divine Smite on it.

2589
03:22:16,362 --> 03:22:19,948
LAURA: Good job! Kill that celestial baby!

2590
03:22:19,948 --> 03:22:22,477
LIAM: There's a lot of dice here.

2591
03:22:22,477 --> 03:22:24,503
LAURA: Get all the bacon!

2592
03:22:24,503 --> 03:22:34,125
LIAM: This is ten, plus psychic damage is 11.
That's not very good. 11 plus Divine Smite is 12,

2593
03:22:34,125 --> 03:22:50,273
19, plus sneak attack damage. 19, 21, 26, 28, 29,
34, 36, 38. And there's nothing extra because it's

2594
03:22:50,273 --> 03:22:52,332
celestial, not a fiend.

2595
03:22:52,332 --> 03:22:53,483
MATT: Correct.

2596
03:22:53,483 --> 03:22:58,456
LIAM: All right. So that was bonus action, action,
I'm going to use my action to then just fly away

2597
03:22:58,456 --> 03:23:04,419
from the fucking thing, a hundred feet away
diagonally up into the tunnel where I can still

2598
03:23:04,419 --> 03:23:06,531
see it, hopefully. I'm hasted.

2599
03:23:06,531 --> 03:23:08,044
MATT: Right.

2600
03:23:08,044 --> 03:23:15,661
LIAM: Movement was to get there. Bonus action for
Vow of Enmity. Action to attack, and then my

2601
03:23:15,661 --> 03:23:18,551
hasted action I can use for dash, hide,
disengage.

2602
03:23:18,551 --> 03:23:20,590
MATT: Correct. Dash is your full movement, which
is--

2603
03:23:20,590 --> 03:23:28,442
LIAM: 60 normally, 120 feet hasted. I didn't make
these rules or these items. (whoosh)

2604
03:23:28,442 --> 03:23:30,664
MATT: Cool.

2605
03:23:30,664 --> 03:23:40,658
LIAM: Diagonally up. I'll fly by my sister, how's
that?

2606
03:23:40,658 --> 03:23:47,549
MATT: You fly by your sister? Okay. No worries.
That ends your turn. All right. Pike, you're up.

2607
03:23:47,549 --> 03:23:50,704
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to cast Beacon of Hope.

2608
03:23:50,871 --> 03:23:55,560
MATT: Actually, sorry. Before the end of your
turn, it's going to go ahead and use a legendary

2609
03:23:55,560 --> 03:23:58,086
action to use a terrain shift.

2610
03:23:58,086 --> 03:24:01,698
TRAVIS: But it's just a baby!

2611
03:24:01,698 --> 03:24:05,213
LAURA: Oh no! We're in its lair!

2612
03:24:05,213 --> 03:24:12,050
MATT: Yep. As you stab the creature, it (gasps).
There's a horrible sucking sound as you dart back.

2613
03:24:12,050 --> 03:24:17,122
It looks over in your direction. The wings flutter
once and it brings its arms up, and as it does and

2614
03:24:17,122 --> 03:24:21,875
you land next to your sister, you feel the air
around you begin to freeze in cold. This energy's

2615
03:24:21,875 --> 03:24:27,283
just (crackling). You feel ice crystals condense
around, and both of you feel the air in your lungs

2616
03:24:27,283 --> 03:24:30,366
suddenly begin to freeze up. I need both of you
guys to make constitution saving throws.

2617
03:24:30,366 --> 03:24:37,471
LAURA: Thanks for coming right next to me on that
one. Goddamn it.

2618
03:24:37,471 --> 03:24:38,642
LIAM: Natural 20.

2619
03:24:38,642 --> 03:24:39,840
MATT: Nice!

2620
03:24:39,840 --> 03:24:41,227
LAURA: What am I doing, a constitution?

2621
03:24:41,227 --> 03:24:42,911
MATT: Constitution saving throw.

2622
03:24:42,911 --> 03:24:44,131
LAURA: Nine.

2623
03:24:44,131 --> 03:24:55,708
MATT: All righty. 19 points of cold damage to you,
Vex, and that is nine points of cold damage to

2624
03:24:55,708 --> 03:25:05,037
you, Vax. And while you manage to pull out of this
space of condensed cold, Vax, your sister,

2625
03:25:05,037 --> 03:25:11,722
however, becomes stunned for one round as your
body is frozen and locked in place.

2626
03:25:11,722 --> 03:25:14,964
SAM: Do we see any of this happen?

2627
03:25:14,964 --> 03:25:19,146
MATT: You watch the air coalesce into this frozen
area, and while the broom is still holding you

2628
03:25:19,146 --> 03:25:25,385
aloft, thankfully, you are standing there in place
and the ice falls, clatters, and slams into the

2629
03:25:25,385 --> 03:25:29,543
ground below you, sounding like the shattering of
a hundred pieces of crystal across the stonework.

2630
03:25:29,543 --> 03:25:31,472
Pike, now it's your turn.

2631
03:25:31,472 --> 03:25:40,749
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to cast Beacon of Hope.
And for my bonus action, I'm going to pull out a

2632
03:25:40,749 --> 03:25:44,962
spiritual weapon of a giant big greatsword.

2633
03:25:44,962 --> 03:25:47,077
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2634
03:25:47,077 --> 03:25:51,714
LAURA: A giant baby rattle that's directly in
front of it.

2635
03:25:51,714 --> 03:25:54,050
TRAVIS: Don't fight, play with this.

2636
03:25:54,050 --> 03:25:58,703
MATT: It's a level two spiritual weapon. Where are
you putting the spiritual weapon?

2637
03:25:58,703 --> 03:26:00,692
ASHLEY: Right in front of the baby!

2638
03:26:00,692 --> 03:26:03,654
MATT: All right. I believe you get to make an
attack with it, then, if you do.

2639
03:26:03,654 --> 03:26:04,345
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2640
03:26:04,414 --> 03:26:06,286
MATT: All right. So.

2641
03:26:06,286 --> 03:26:10,808
ASHLEY: Oh, but I don't know if I want to hurt the
baby. Did you do any damage?

2642
03:26:10,808 --> 03:26:12,037
LIAM: Yeah.

2643
03:26:12,037 --> 03:26:15,671
MATT: Once again, roll for attack on that.

2644
03:26:15,671 --> 03:26:18,892
ASHLEY: Oh, that's not very good.

2645
03:26:18,892 --> 03:26:23,853
MATT: So you roll a d20 and add your spell attack
modifier.

2646
03:26:23,853 --> 03:26:25,371
ASHLEY: 13.

2647
03:26:25,371 --> 03:26:30,515
MATT: 13. (whoosh) It swings, and the creature
flaps out of the way and avoids the blow.

2648
03:26:30,515 --> 03:26:32,596
ASHLEY: Stupid piece of dice crap.

2649
03:26:32,596 --> 03:26:34,030
MATT: Are you going to move or stay where you
are?

2650
03:26:34,030 --> 03:26:39,079
LAURA: Oh yeah! I'm resistant to cold, Travis just
reminded me! I have cold resistance because of my

2651
03:26:39,079 --> 03:26:40,189
Vorugal armor.

2652
03:26:40,189 --> 03:26:41,364
MATT: You do.

2653
03:26:41,364 --> 03:26:42,874
LAURA: Does that mean I roll again for--

2654
03:26:42,874 --> 03:26:45,111
MATT: No, you take half the damage, but you're
still stunned.

2655
03:26:45,111 --> 03:26:49,437
LAURA: Oh, okay. So that was 17?

2656
03:26:49,437 --> 03:26:52,200
MATT: You would take nine damage instead of the
19.

2657
03:26:52,200 --> 03:26:54,241
LIAM: Nine instead of 18 is what you would've
taken for it.

2658
03:26:54,241 --> 03:26:55,686
LAURA: Okay, so add nine back.

2659
03:26:55,686 --> 03:26:58,395
MATT: So do you want to move with your turn?

2660
03:26:58,395 --> 03:26:59,966
ASHLEY: No, I'm going to stay.

2661
03:26:59,966 --> 03:27:01,041
MATT: Okay.

2662
03:27:01,041 --> 03:27:05,792
ASHLEY: I'm going to stay. Because we're on the
carpet, right? Grog, Percy, and I on the carpet?

2663
03:27:05,792 --> 03:27:07,047
TALIESIN: I'm not on the carpet.

2664
03:27:07,047 --> 03:27:09,855
ASHLEY: You're not on the carpet anymore? Oh, the
three of us. I'm going to stay on the carpet.

2665
03:27:09,855 --> 03:27:11,848
TALIESIN: You can move the carpet forward,
though.

2666
03:27:11,848 --> 03:27:13,514
LAURA: Did Beacon of Hope get everybody?

2667
03:27:13,514 --> 03:27:28,351
MATT: Beacon of Hope. The range on that is 30
feet. 30-foot range gets everybody

2668
03:27:28,351 --> 03:27:30,572
except for the elemental.

2669
03:27:30,572 --> 03:27:31,998
MARISHA: That's cool.

2670
03:27:31,998 --> 03:27:33,729
TALIESIN: What do we get?

2671
03:27:33,729 --> 03:27:38,121
MATT: Beacon of Hope, you have advantage on Wisdom
saving throws, death saving throws, and you regain

2672
03:27:38,170 --> 03:27:41,046
the max number of hit points possible from any
healing.

2673
03:27:41,046 --> 03:27:42,522
MARISHA: Sick.

2674
03:27:42,522 --> 03:27:45,064
MATT: All righty. That end your turn?

2675
03:27:45,064 --> 03:27:46,432
ASHLEY: Yes.

2676
03:27:46,432 --> 03:27:51,334
LAURA: Death saving throw is huge. And healing is
huge.

2677
03:27:51,334 --> 03:27:59,525
MATT: At the end of your turn, the creature goes
(raspy breathing) and you watch as the ground

2678
03:27:59,525 --> 03:28:09,848
right beneath the carpet explodes. It peels back
as molten lava suddenly begins to spill up in a

2679
03:28:09,848 --> 03:28:13,825
column beneath you, splattering up and to the back
and over the top of the carpet. I need everybody

2680
03:28:13,825 --> 03:28:19,768
in this cluster, this ten-foot-by-ten-foot
section, to make a dexterity saving throw.

2681
03:28:19,768 --> 03:28:32,773
SAM: Not good, but maybe I'm lucky. Oh, am I not
in that? Where am I?

2682
03:28:32,773 --> 03:28:34,801
TALIESIN: You're over on the corner.

2683
03:28:34,801 --> 03:28:36,627
SAM: I have no idea where I am.

2684
03:28:36,627 --> 03:28:40,082
LAURA: You're next to the big white thing.

2685
03:28:40,082 --> 03:28:41,319
SAM: I am?

2686
03:28:41,319 --> 03:28:43,286
MATT: So Grog, Pike, and Keyleth.

2687
03:28:43,286 --> 03:28:44,720
SAM: Oh, well then, never mind.

2688
03:28:44,720 --> 03:28:46,294
TRAVIS: Danger sense 18.

2689
03:28:46,294 --> 03:28:48,051
MATT: Danger sense 18.

2690
03:28:48,051 --> 03:28:49,176
MARISHA: 17.

2691
03:28:49,176 --> 03:28:50,387
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

2692
03:28:50,387 --> 03:28:52,173
MATT: Natural 20 plus, what's your--

2693
03:28:52,173 --> 03:28:54,557
ASHLEY: One! 21!

2694
03:28:54,557 --> 03:28:56,958
MATT: Pike's the only one who made it.

2695
03:28:56,958 --> 03:28:59,249
ASHLEY: What?

2696
03:28:59,249 --> 03:29:06,258
MATT: Pike, you suffer 21 points of fire damage,
halved because of your armor, so you only take

2697
03:29:06,258 --> 03:29:09,717
ten. Ten points of fire damage.

2698
03:29:09,717 --> 03:29:10,815
ASHLEY: Okay.

2699
03:29:10,815 --> 03:29:13,523
MATT: I need you to go ahead and make a
concentration check on Beacon of Hope.

2700
03:29:13,523 --> 03:29:17,318
LAURA: You got this. You got this, Pike.

2701
03:29:17,318 --> 03:29:19,292
MATT: Just roll a constitution saving throw.

2702
03:29:19,292 --> 03:29:20,798
TRAVIS: Fucking molten lava!

2703
03:29:20,798 --> 03:29:24,678
MATT: Keyleth and Grog, you guys both take 42
points of fire damage.

2704
03:29:24,678 --> 03:29:29,195
TRAVIS: Oh, it was nice being over 250 for a
little while.

2705
03:29:29,195 --> 03:29:30,817
ASHLEY: Fucking fuck.

2706
03:29:30,817 --> 03:29:50,048
MATT: The ground below you right now is currently
in flames, and you guys have to stick around that

2707
03:29:50,048 --> 03:29:57,787
space there. The open ground is billowing flame
and lava now, and the area around that platform is

2708
03:29:57,787 --> 03:30:01,212
searing hot. So what did you roll?

2709
03:30:01,212 --> 03:30:02,386
ASHLEY: Five.

2710
03:30:02,386 --> 03:30:03,864
MATT: A five with your--

2711
03:30:03,864 --> 03:30:05,736
ASHLEY: Yes.

2712
03:30:05,736 --> 03:30:09,437
MATT: Yeah. You lose Beacon of Hope. Sorry.

2713
03:30:09,437 --> 03:30:16,470
LAURA: What is it? You have to get above half of
the damage you took, is that what it is?

2714
03:30:16,499 --> 03:30:19,556
MATT: You have to get above half the damage you
took or ten, whichever is higher.

2715
03:30:19,556 --> 03:30:20,888
LAURA: Oh.

2716
03:30:20,888 --> 03:30:23,361
TRAVIS: Do we stay on the carpet or are we knocked
off?

2717
03:30:23,361 --> 03:30:29,532
MATT: You guys can choose to stay on the carpet.
You pull out of the way, and now the area is just

2718
03:30:29,532 --> 03:30:32,874
billowing with lava and flame. Keyleth, it's your
turn.

2719
03:30:32,874 --> 03:30:37,455
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to take and control my
air elemental and send him over.

2720
03:30:37,455 --> 03:30:40,895
MATT: All right. You took how much damage? 42?

2721
03:30:40,895 --> 03:30:42,061
MARISHA: 42.

2722
03:30:42,061 --> 03:30:45,270
MATT: Make a concentration check. Constitution
saving throw.

2723
03:30:45,270 --> 03:30:48,565
MARISHA: So I have to get over-- I have advantage
on these.

2724
03:30:48,565 --> 03:30:51,635
MATT: Yes. You have to get over a 21.

2725
03:30:51,635 --> 03:30:53,632
SAM: Over a 21!

2726
03:30:53,632 --> 03:30:57,003
MATT: A 21 or over.

2727
03:30:57,003 --> 03:31:00,192
MARISHA: What's 17 plus four?

2728
03:31:00,192 --> 03:31:01,361
SAM: 21.

2729
03:31:01,361 --> 03:31:03,519
MATT: 21. You just maintain concentration.

2730
03:31:03,519 --> 03:31:06,844
LAURA: Good roll!

2731
03:31:06,844 --> 03:31:18,005
MARISHA: Thank you, Gil! All right. So (boom) I
send him over with my staff.

2732
03:31:18,005 --> 03:31:22,624
It has 90-feet fly speed.

2733
03:31:22,624 --> 03:31:27,513
MATT: 90-feet flying speed? Yeah, he gets over
there easy. Plops on over.

2734
03:31:27,513 --> 03:31:36,179
MARISHA: And he's going to go ahead and do a
Whirlwind. The creatures in his space have to make

2735
03:31:36,179 --> 03:31:39,238
a DC 13 strength saving throw.

2736
03:31:39,238 --> 03:31:46,643
MATT: Okay. Nope. This is not a very strong
creature.

2737
03:31:46,643 --> 03:31:51,588
MARISHA: That's what I hoped. They take 3d8 plus
two bludgeoning damage.

2738
03:31:51,588 --> 03:31:54,189
MATT: Go ahead and roll the damage on that, yeah.

2739
03:31:54,189 --> 03:32:08,290
MARISHA: Oh, that's nasty. 12 plus seven is 19
plus two, so 21. And they are flung up to 20 feet

2740
03:32:08,290 --> 03:32:11,656
away from the elemental in a random direction and
knocked prone.

2741
03:32:11,656 --> 03:32:16,582
MATT: Random direction, I'll roll for that. Okay.
That's going to fling him 20 feet into the five,

2742
03:32:16,582 --> 03:32:20,654
ten, 15, 20 into the wall right there, and prone.

2743
03:32:20,654 --> 03:32:22,566
MARISHA: And are knocked prone.

2744
03:32:22,566 --> 03:32:24,143
LIAM: Stupid baby.

2745
03:32:24,143 --> 03:32:27,171
MARISHA: Do I still have line of sight?

2746
03:32:27,171 --> 03:32:30,860
MATT: To it right now, no. You would have to get
off the carpet to go.

2747
03:32:30,860 --> 03:32:38,843
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to get off the carpet and
walk over just to where I have line of sight.

2748
03:32:38,843 --> 03:32:50,348
MATT: Okay. At the top of your turn, by the way,
you suffer eight points of fire damage by the

2749
03:32:50,348 --> 03:32:52,102
proximity to the flaming platform there.

2750
03:32:52,102 --> 03:32:57,535
MARISHA: Even though my mantle allows me to ignore
the penalties of dangerous weather effects?

2751
03:32:57,535 --> 03:33:02,593
MATT: It's not so much a weather effect. It's more
that there's a heaping column of molten rock.

2752
03:33:02,593 --> 03:33:05,059
TRAVIS: Your old friend, molten lava.

2753
03:33:05,059 --> 03:33:14,258
MATT: Eight points of fire damage. And I need you
to make another concentration check.

2754
03:33:14,258 --> 03:33:16,695
SAM: Oh no, another concentration check!

2755
03:33:16,695 --> 03:33:19,853
MARISHA: I'm a warcaster, though, man! Because
that's eight, so I just have

2756
03:33:19,853 --> 03:33:21,215
to get over a ten, right?

2757
03:33:21,215 --> 03:33:22,447
MATT: Yeah.

2758
03:33:22,447 --> 03:33:26,397
LAURA: What is this considered, Underdark, or a
dungeon?

2759
03:33:26,397 --> 03:33:28,732
MARISHA: Rolled a 13.

2760
03:33:28,732 --> 03:33:35,854
MATT: This is considered subterranean, not
Underdark. Cavern. All right, so you've done that.

2761
03:33:35,854 --> 03:33:38,269
What do you want to do, Keyleth? You're over
here.

2762
03:33:38,269 --> 03:33:40,498
MARISHA: Okay. Can I move over to where I have
line of sight?

2763
03:33:40,498 --> 03:33:43,083
MATT: Yeah, so you leap over and you get line of
sight on him right there.

2764
03:33:43,083 --> 03:33:44,944
MARISHA: Okay, can I do Blight?

2765
03:33:44,944 --> 03:33:48,746
MATT: Sure. What's the DC on that?

2766
03:33:48,746 --> 03:33:53,595
MARISHA: I think my spell level, so 20.

2767
03:33:53,595 --> 03:33:55,578
MATT: And it's a constitution saving throw, I
believe?

2768
03:33:55,578 --> 03:33:57,097
MARISHA: 8d8.

2769
03:33:57,097 --> 03:34:00,800
MATT: Six plus ten, so it's a 16.

2770
03:34:00,800 --> 03:34:03,086
MARISHA: No, fail.

2771
03:34:03,086 --> 03:34:05,829
MATT: Yeah. So roll your 8d8 necrotic damage.

2772
03:34:05,829 --> 03:34:07,639
LAURA: Get it!

2773
03:34:07,639 --> 03:34:12,399
MATT: Yeah, no. Even with advantage on the save,
it rolled a six and a four.

2774
03:34:12,399 --> 03:34:21,891
MARISHA: One, two, three, four. Give me two more.
One more, and another.

2775
03:34:21,891 --> 03:34:24,192
TALIESIN: I don't know if I have another.

2776
03:34:24,192 --> 03:34:27,177
MARISHA: Give me a d8. Okay.

2777
03:34:27,177 --> 03:34:33,009
TALIESIN: And you reroll ones, right?

2778
03:34:33,009 --> 03:34:53,279
MARISHA: No, on elementals. Four, five, nine, 14,
plus eight is 22, plus four is 26, plus two is 28.

2779
03:34:53,279 --> 03:34:56,366
28 Blight damage.

2780
03:34:56,366 --> 03:35:01,282
MATT: Nice. As you reach, it's on the ground. It's
trying to get back up, and its wings are flapping,

2781
03:35:01,282 --> 03:35:06,289
and all of a sudden you watch as its gray,
withered skin turns dark black on one half of its

2782
03:35:06,289 --> 03:35:12,324
body and it (screech) shrieks out and gives
another scream (hoarse scream) from the ground,

2783
03:35:12,324 --> 03:35:21,883
and the area quakes again, and you feel the ground
shimmy a bit. The ground beneath you, as its last

2784
03:35:21,883 --> 03:35:27,289
legendary action, begins to give way. Keyleth, I
need you to make a dexterity saving throw.

2785
03:35:27,289 --> 03:35:31,550
MARISHA: Fucking lava!

2786
03:35:31,550 --> 03:35:35,516
TALIESIN: Didn't you move? Wait, no, you moved,
didn't you?

2787
03:35:35,516 --> 03:35:37,240
MATT: Yeah, this is a different area.

2788
03:35:37,240 --> 03:35:42,984
MARISHA: That's not bad. 19. No, 18?

2789
03:35:42,984 --> 03:35:48,204
MATT: Nope. So as you finish casting this and you
hear it scream, you cover your ears, and suddenly

2790
03:35:48,204 --> 03:35:52,251
the ground moves out beneath you. You watch as the
actual floor (whoosh).

2791
03:35:52,251 --> 03:35:54,983
MARISHA: I turn to everyone behind me and I go,
aw, fuck!

2792
03:35:54,983 --> 03:36:02,242
MATT: As you watch Keyleth plummet into a pit
below. You take eight points of bludgeoning damage

2793
03:36:02,242 --> 03:36:05,873
and the ground (whoosh) covers over her.

2794
03:36:05,873 --> 03:36:08,803
MARISHA: It's fine.

2795
03:36:08,803 --> 03:36:15,084
MATT: Keyleth vanishes. The ground seems to
swallow her up. Keyleth, the entire pit collapses

2796
03:36:15,084 --> 03:36:18,761
in on you, and you're currently restrained
underground, and you cannot breathe.

2797
03:36:18,761 --> 03:36:20,043
MARISHA: All right.

2798
03:36:20,043 --> 03:36:22,385
TALIESIN: That's fixable.

2799
03:36:22,385 --> 03:36:25,057
SAM: But can you cast things while you can't
move?

2800
03:36:25,057 --> 03:36:27,589
MATT: I need you to make another concentration
check.

2801
03:36:27,589 --> 03:36:29,200
MARISHA: On my elemental?

2802
03:36:29,200 --> 03:36:30,602
MATT: Yes.

2803
03:36:30,602 --> 03:36:37,119
MARISHA: Yeah, 13 plus my constitution, right?

2804
03:36:37,119 --> 03:36:38,248
MATT: Yeah.

2805
03:36:38,248 --> 03:36:39,740
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm good.

2806
03:36:39,740 --> 03:36:42,070
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn, Keyleth?

2807
03:36:42,070 --> 03:36:44,571
TRAVIS: Matt, can you point to where the cherub
is?

2808
03:36:44,571 --> 03:36:54,786
MATT: I am, because it's his turn. The cherub
creature, this Symphior, begins to fly up off the

2809
03:36:54,786 --> 03:37:01,284
ground and make its way back in this direction,
out into the open once more.

2810
03:37:01,284 --> 03:37:05,329
LIAM: Keeps everyone from getting a good night's
sleep.

2811
03:37:05,329 --> 03:37:07,713
LAURA: He needs a nap.

2812
03:37:07,713 --> 03:37:13,034
ASHLEY: He has a dirty diaper. He's mad.

2813
03:37:13,034 --> 03:37:16,080
LIAM: It's been a thousand years!

2814
03:37:16,080 --> 03:37:28,043
MATT: As it floats upward, it looks over towards
where-- let's see, because all it sees is you two.

2815
03:37:28,043 --> 03:37:34,053
You both are still in the flames right there. It's
not worried about the fire at the moment. It sees

2816
03:37:34,053 --> 03:37:41,243
you, Taryon, and goes (hoarse wheezing) and lifts
its hands up. I need you to go ahead and make a

2817
03:37:41,243 --> 03:37:43,744
dexterity saving throw.

2818
03:37:43,744 --> 03:37:50,591
SAM: I'm feeling lucky. Natural 20! Plus one.

2819
03:37:50,591 --> 03:38:02,981
MATT: That's great. So you only suffer 11 points
of piercing damage.

2820
03:38:02,981 --> 03:38:04,741
SAM: Hey, that's not bad.

2821
03:38:04,741 --> 03:38:08,394
MATT: As you leap out of the way, you watch as the
ground suddenly turns into a series of earthlike

2822
03:38:08,394 --> 03:38:14,000
spikes underneath, and some pierce you and scratch
you and you roll out of the way. You barely move

2823
03:38:14,000 --> 03:38:21,244
off to the side, where now you see this giant,
jutting series of spike-like pillars forcing up

2824
03:38:21,244 --> 03:38:27,395
from the ground. All right, that's going to end
that attack, and it's going to use the rest of its

2825
03:38:27,395 --> 03:38:36,647
movement to move back (whoosh) over to there in
the corner. That brings us back to Vex.

2826
03:38:36,647 --> 03:38:38,138
It's your turn now.

2827
03:38:38,138 --> 03:38:39,758
LAURA: Yeah, I'm frozen.

2828
03:38:39,758 --> 03:38:42,087
MATT: Yeah, so you're stunned, and that's your
turn.

2829
03:38:42,087 --> 03:38:43,285
LAURA: Yay.

2830
03:38:43,285 --> 03:38:48,189
MATT: You eventually break the ice off at the end
of your turn, and you're breathing heavily and

2831
03:38:48,189 --> 03:38:52,966
trying to get the feeling back in your skin.
That's your go. Grog, you're up.

2832
03:38:52,966 --> 03:38:55,278
TRAVIS: What does it take to activate the coin?

2833
03:38:55,278 --> 03:38:57,081
SAM: You have to slap it on yourself.

2834
03:38:57,081 --> 03:38:58,521
MATT: It's an action.

2835
03:38:58,521 --> 03:39:01,066
TRAVIS: Yeah? Just an action?

2836
03:39:01,066 --> 03:39:02,447
MATT: Which spell do you have?

2837
03:39:02,447 --> 03:39:03,947
TRAVIS: It's the Jump coin, three times my--

2838
03:39:03,947 --> 03:39:05,345
MATT: What's the casting time of Jump?

2839
03:39:05,345 --> 03:39:06,358
SAM: It's touch.

2840
03:39:06,358 --> 03:39:08,179
MATT: What's the casting <i>time</i> of Jump?

2841
03:39:08,179 --> 03:39:12,098
SAM: It lasts a minute. It's instantaneous. You
just touch, right?

2842
03:39:12,098 --> 03:39:13,725
TALIESIN: No, is it a bonus action?

2843
03:39:13,725 --> 03:39:16,714
MATT: So that would be your action to use it on
yourself.

2844
03:39:16,714 --> 03:39:26,801
TRAVIS: Oh, damn. It's that whole shit, yo. All
right. (grunts) I'm going to jump! And I would

2845
03:39:26,801 --> 03:39:37,723
like to rage as my bonus action. And with my new
Jump coin, I would like to jump with my Boots of

2846
03:39:37,723 --> 03:39:44,886
Feral Leaping. It's three times my horizontal jump
speed, which is 20 feet, so 60 feet.

2847
03:39:44,886 --> 03:39:47,463
MATT: Okay. You also take seven points of fire
damage at the start of your turn, because you're

2848
03:39:47,463 --> 03:39:48,476
by this flame.

2849
03:39:48,476 --> 03:39:55,384
TRAVIS: Oh, got it. Nice, that's fine. And can I
jump towards the baby? Actually just to the right

2850
03:39:55,384 --> 03:40:01,011
of the-- just over here.

2851
03:40:01,011 --> 03:40:02,559
MATT: Over to this side there?

2852
03:40:02,559 --> 03:40:03,723
TRAVIS: Yeah, right there.

2853
03:40:03,723 --> 03:40:07,800
MATT: Okay, yeah. You run (whoosh, thud) land next
to it.

2854
03:40:07,800 --> 03:40:11,942
TRAVIS: Nice. Do I have any movement left?

2855
03:40:11,942 --> 03:40:16,094
MATT: With the run and the jump, you have maybe
ten feet.

2856
03:40:16,094 --> 03:40:17,695
TRAVIS: Okay. I want to get right up on him.

2857
03:40:17,695 --> 03:40:20,600
MATT: Yeah, you're right up on him.

2858
03:40:20,600 --> 03:40:27,859
TRAVIS: Never mind. I'm good. Rage, jump, no more
action. Titanstone Knuckles? Next round. Okay.

2859
03:40:27,859 --> 03:40:29,396
MATT: You have an action, still.

2860
03:40:29,396 --> 03:40:30,434
TRAVIS: Oh, I do?

2861
03:40:30,434 --> 03:40:35,394
MATT: Well, no, because you said it's a bonus
action to do the leap? What's it say on that? Just

2862
03:40:35,456 --> 03:40:40,291
to do the leap, right? It was the run. You still
have an action.

2863
03:40:40,291 --> 03:40:41,623
TRAVIS: I want to hit him.

2864
03:40:41,623 --> 03:40:43,013
MATT: Go for it.

2865
03:40:43,013 --> 03:40:45,562
TRAVIS: Great weapon master, reckless attack.

2866
03:40:45,562 --> 03:40:46,858
MATT: Okay!

2867
03:40:46,858 --> 03:40:56,084
TRAVIS: That's a 26.

2868
03:40:56,084 --> 03:40:58,386
MATT: 26 with the minus five? Yeah, that hits.

2869
03:40:58,386 --> 03:41:12,239
TRAVIS: Nice. 12. Where are you? I should have
gotten this beforehand. Nice! Plus ten. 37.

2870
03:41:12,239 --> 03:41:17,098
MATT: All righty. That's your first strike.

2871
03:41:17,098 --> 03:41:19,244
TRAVIS: Oh, I get another one!

2872
03:41:19,244 --> 03:41:21,262
MATT: You have extra attack, man!

2873
03:41:21,262 --> 03:41:27,901
TRAVIS: 11, 24.

2874
03:41:27,901 --> 03:41:36,483
MATT: 24 does not hit. It's a tiny size. It's hard
to swing at, and as your axe almost catches it, it

2875
03:41:36,483 --> 03:41:38,056
(whoosh) out of the way.

2876
03:41:38,056 --> 03:41:42,148
TRAVIS: Okay. Good to know. I whiff. That's it. I
just have the two.

2877
03:41:42,148 --> 03:41:50,313
MATT: Yep, that's your turn. At the end of your
turn, because it's reset back to its ground, it's

2878
03:41:50,313 --> 03:41:55,547
going to go ahead and look to you in front of it
and go (hoarse breathing).

2879
03:41:55,547 --> 03:41:56,947
Make a dexterity check.

2880
03:41:56,947 --> 03:41:59,345
TRAVIS: Okay. Saving throw or just dexterity?

2881
03:41:59,345 --> 03:42:00,784
MATT: Dexterity saving throw, sorry.

2882
03:42:00,784 --> 03:42:05,743
TRAVIS: I get two of those. That's better. 19.

2883
03:42:05,743 --> 03:42:12,485
MATT: The ground crumbles beneath you and you
suddenly (whoosh) fall below. You are raging. It

2884
03:42:12,485 --> 03:42:18,028
would've been 12 points of bludgeoning damage, but
it becomes six. But you are suddenly buried and

2885
03:42:18,028 --> 03:42:20,848
restrained underground.

2886
03:42:20,848 --> 03:42:23,760
LIAM: Got that slick stuff on you? Crisco oil?

2887
03:42:23,760 --> 03:42:25,941
TRAVIS: But that's my next turn. That happens on
my turn.

2888
03:42:25,941 --> 03:42:28,694
TALIESIN: Yeah, you burn five feet of movement to
get out of it.

2889
03:42:28,694 --> 03:42:30,713
TRAVIS: Can I get out of it if I'm buried in soil,
though?

2890
03:42:30,713 --> 03:42:34,712
MATT: Freedom of Movement. I'll say it doesn't
have--

2891
03:42:34,712 --> 03:42:38,291
MARISHA: That's why I cast it on him, man.

2892
03:42:38,291 --> 03:42:40,670
TALIESIN: You parkour around the rocks as they try
and--

2893
03:42:40,670 --> 03:42:48,587
MATT: Well, he's buried in the ground, regardless.
That's the effect. He didn't avoid the burying. So

2894
03:42:48,587 --> 03:42:53,402
I guess you'd just, if you want to use your action
to try to escape, you do so.

2895
03:42:53,402 --> 03:42:56,829
LAURA: You could enlarge, maybe. You can enlarge
and come up out of it.

2896
03:42:56,829 --> 03:43:04,296
MATT: All right. That ends that go. Taryon, you're
up.

2897
03:43:04,296 --> 03:43:12,414
SAM: Me? Oh god. All right. I don't have anything
I can do. I will click my Boots of Speed, making

2898
03:43:12,414 --> 03:43:22,348
me faster, and then I will move. Full movement of
60 feet towards him-- or her.

2899
03:43:22,348 --> 03:43:24,952
We don't know, do we?

2900
03:43:24,952 --> 03:43:28,787
LAURA: Is it wearing a diaper, or is its dangly
bits hanging out?

2901
03:43:28,787 --> 03:43:30,580
LIAM: Is a peeper hanging out?

2902
03:43:30,580 --> 03:43:32,044
SAM: Is it naked?

2903
03:43:32,044 --> 03:43:37,573
MATT: You've got a pretty close look, if you
wanted to take a moment to inspect.

2904
03:43:37,573 --> 03:43:43,441
LIAM: It's a boy!

2905
03:43:43,488 --> 03:43:46,179
SAM: We're trying to kill this thing, yeah?

2906
03:43:46,261 --> 03:43:48,323
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2907
03:43:48,323 --> 03:43:56,568
SAM: I guess I'll punch a baby. It's going to
miss, though. That's a slippery baby, right?

2908
03:43:56,568 --> 03:44:05,292
MATT: At 60 feet of movement, you're not quite
within melee range of it.

2909
03:44:05,292 --> 03:44:07,766
SAM: No, I was going to use my Ring of the Ram.

2910
03:44:07,766 --> 03:44:09,166
MATT: Oh, that'll do.

2911
03:44:09,166 --> 03:44:13,011
SAM: But I'm probably not going to hit, because
it's got an amazing AC.

2912
03:44:13,011 --> 03:44:14,390
LIAM: Got any Luck left?

2913
03:44:14,393 --> 03:44:15,891
SAM: Yeah, I do.

2914
03:44:15,891 --> 03:44:17,610
TALIESIN: See what happens.

2915
03:44:17,610 --> 03:44:19,364
LIAM: Got to do something.

2916
03:44:19,364 --> 03:44:28,796
SAM: Is this going to be a long fight? I'll do all
three charges of the Ring of the Ram,

2917
03:44:28,796 --> 03:44:30,475
and punch a baby.

2918
03:44:30,475 --> 03:44:32,756
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.

2919
03:44:32,756 --> 03:44:42,583
SAM: Eight. Not good enough, I'll use Luck. 13
plus nine? 22.

2920
03:44:42,583 --> 03:44:49,785
ASHLEY: Wait! Can I War God's Blessing?

2921
03:44:49,785 --> 03:44:51,464
MATT: What's the range on War God's Blessing?

2922
03:44:51,464 --> 03:44:53,650
ASHLEY: Let's see. 30 feet?

2923
03:44:53,650 --> 03:44:57,259
MATT: No, he's out of range for that,
unfortunately. Sorry!

2924
03:44:57,259 --> 03:44:58,852
LIAM: I wanted that baby to be punched so bad.

2925
03:44:58,852 --> 03:45:05,383
MATT: As you (ring firing), it (whoosh) out of the
way and the fist goes by. Slamming into the wall.

2926
03:45:05,383 --> 03:45:07,438
(crash)

2927
03:45:07,438 --> 03:45:09,163
TALIESIN: One day, it's going to be epic.

2928
03:45:09,163 --> 03:45:12,908
SAM: It worked once.

2929
03:45:12,908 --> 03:45:15,444
MATT: It got you a kill. The marid.

2930
03:45:15,444 --> 03:45:17,415
LIAM: That little baby just Zatoichi-ed out of the
way.

2931
03:45:17,415 --> 03:45:20,079
MATT: Yeah, so you're just like, (ring firing). No
effect. It dodges out of the way. And now you can

2932
03:45:20,079 --> 03:45:25,094
see its weird, lifeless white eyes turn towards
you once more.

2933
03:45:25,094 --> 03:45:26,633
SAM: Oh, great.

2934
03:45:26,633 --> 03:45:28,194
MATT: That end your turn?

2935
03:45:28,194 --> 03:45:29,214
SAM: Yep.

2936
03:45:29,214 --> 03:45:45,500
MATT: All righty. Let's see here. It's going to go
ahead and use another ability now. As it sees that

2937
03:45:45,500 --> 03:45:51,029
you're closed in, it glances over, and you watch
as suddenly, a bunch of stonework just

2938
03:45:51,073 --> 03:45:57,503
(rushing noise) up in the center of the area, as now--

2939
03:45:57,503 --> 03:46:01,977
MARISHA: Oh, fuck. One of these guys. What? A
wall?

2940
03:46:01,977 --> 03:46:07,407
MATT: A giant stone wall suddenly shoots up above
to about 40 feet.

2941
03:46:07,407 --> 03:46:13,773
SAM: We got this, guys. Don't worry. Me and Grog
got it. Me and buried-Grog and buried-Keyleth,

2942
03:46:13,773 --> 03:46:14,846
we got this.

2943
03:46:14,846 --> 03:46:16,671
MARISHA: Wait, you're buried, too?

2944
03:46:16,671 --> 03:46:18,500
SAM: No, you are and Grog is.

2945
03:46:18,500 --> 03:46:21,605
MARISHA: I'm under the wall, right?

2946
03:46:21,605 --> 03:46:26,778
MATT: You're underneath right over here. You're on
the outskirts of the wall.

2947
03:46:26,778 --> 03:46:28,334
SAM: It's just me and the baby right now?

2948
03:46:28,334 --> 03:46:32,342
MATT: Yeah, you and the baby, and an air
elemental, and a giant sword that's swinging.

2949
03:46:32,342 --> 03:46:33,787
MARISHA: Yeah, my air elemental is there.

2950
03:46:33,787 --> 03:46:35,578
SAM: Oh, great. I'm fine, then.

2951
03:46:35,578 --> 03:46:41,274
MATT: But you lose vision entirely, Pike. Just
(rushing noise) wall's in front of you. Percy,

2952
03:46:41,274 --> 03:46:42,128
you're up.

2953
03:46:42,128 --> 03:46:44,025
TALIESIN: So is the wall hitting the roof?

2954
03:46:44,025 --> 03:46:47,164
MATT: No, the wall would have to go way high. It's
about 40 feet up.

2955
03:46:47,164 --> 03:46:49,811
TALIESIN: I'm going to run up to the top of that
wall.

2956
03:46:49,811 --> 03:46:53,566
MATT: Your movement will not get you to the top.
Because you only move 30 feet.

2957
03:46:53,566 --> 03:46:55,748
TALIESIN: How far will my movement get me?

2958
03:46:55,748 --> 03:46:57,237
MATT: It'll get you about there.

2959
03:46:57,237 --> 03:47:01,101
ASHLEY: Parkour!

2960
03:47:01,101 --> 03:47:04,207
TRAVIS: Like some unmotivated Spider-Man.

2961
03:47:04,207 --> 03:47:09,003
TALIESIN: In that case-- oh fuck, I've got nothing
I can do.

2962
03:47:09,003 --> 03:47:12,565
MATT: I'll put you right there to remind us, but
you're almost at the top of the wall

2963
03:47:12,565 --> 03:47:13,687
at your full movement.

2964
03:47:13,687 --> 03:47:16,837
TALIESIN: Well, then I will burn my action to dash
up.

2965
03:47:16,837 --> 03:47:19,805
MATT: Okay. You get to the top of the wall, there,
and you can now see it.

2966
03:47:19,805 --> 03:47:24,770
TALIESIN: And I assume I can get part of the way
down the wall as well with my action?

2967
03:47:24,770 --> 03:47:26,605
MATT: You can get partway down the wall, yeah.

2968
03:47:26,605 --> 03:47:29,475
TALIESIN: Yeah, so I just want to start making my
way, I'm going Spider-man.

2969
03:47:29,475 --> 03:47:34,412
MATT: So you get about, I'll say, there on the
opposite side.

2970
03:47:34,412 --> 03:47:36,683
TALIESIN: That was definitely irritating.

2971
03:47:36,683 --> 03:47:38,156
MATT: That's your turn, Percy?

2972
03:47:38,156 --> 03:47:45,462
TALIESIN: That, and I'm going to cast Hex on that
little baby. And he has disadvantage on, let's

2973
03:47:45,462 --> 03:47:51,590
make it his wisdom checks.

2974
03:47:51,590 --> 03:48:07,506
MATT: Okay. All right. At the end of your turn,
Percy. Let's see, it's going to

2975
03:48:07,506 --> 03:48:09,545
go ahead and use--

2976
03:48:09,545 --> 03:48:13,961
TALIESIN: That's a lot of actions, this creature.

2977
03:48:13,961 --> 03:48:21,939
MATT: It's legendary actions. It manipulates the
area around it. Because you are currently standing

2978
03:48:21,939 --> 03:48:27,200
on the side there. No, you know what, it's going
to hold off. It's not going to do anything.

2979
03:48:27,200 --> 03:48:28,528
Vax, you're up.

2980
03:48:28,528 --> 03:48:30,571
TALIESIN: I haven't actually technically attacked
it.

2981
03:48:30,571 --> 03:48:36,375
LIAM: I know what I want to do. You tell me what I
can do. First thing I want to do is cast Bless

2982
03:48:36,375 --> 03:48:42,096
on-- I grab Vex, cast Bless on us and Pike, I have
a range of 30 feet on it.

2983
03:48:42,096 --> 03:48:43,573
MATT: Okay.

2984
03:48:43,573 --> 03:48:52,861
LIAM: Is that bonus? No, I don't want to do that.
I don't want to do that. I fly straight at Pike

2985
03:48:52,861 --> 03:48:54,838
and I'm going to lift her up.

2986
03:48:54,838 --> 03:49:02,777
MATT: Okay, you immediately take eight points of
fire damage by getting close to the flames to grab

2987
03:49:02,777 --> 03:49:04,361
her. It's like (fire noises).

2988
03:49:04,361 --> 03:49:09,639
LIAM: Sure. And then is it an action to grab and
an action to lift and carry over?

2989
03:49:09,639 --> 03:49:15,298
MATT: I'd say it would be an action to grab her
enough, and you're going to move

2990
03:49:15,298 --> 03:49:16,660
at half speed with her.

2991
03:49:16,660 --> 03:49:18,547
LIAM: Which is still a ton at this point.

2992
03:49:18,547 --> 03:49:19,885
MATT: Yeah.

2993
03:49:19,885 --> 03:49:23,399
LIAM: And that's all I need is the action to grab
her and movement to go over?

2994
03:49:23,399 --> 03:49:29,686
MATT: Action, and your movement there was about
there, I'd say you'll get your action and your

2995
03:49:29,686 --> 03:49:32,238
movement will get you to up above the wall.

2996
03:49:32,238 --> 03:49:41,022
LIAM: Okay. Action and movement will. All right,
then I will leave her on top of the wall, and I

2997
03:49:41,022 --> 03:49:49,841
will use my bonus action to fly within range of
baby, and I should have one action left, yeah?

2998
03:49:49,841 --> 03:49:52,944
Action, action, bonus action, hasted.

2999
03:49:52,944 --> 03:49:58,689
MATT: Right. Hold on, no. You used an action to
pick up Pike. You brought her up there, you moved,

3000
03:49:58,689 --> 03:50:08,879
you have another action and a bonus action. You
have an action and a bonus action. But the extra

3001
03:50:08,879 --> 03:50:11,773
action that you have is from your haste, which
means it can be used for either

3002
03:50:11,773 --> 03:50:13,172
a melee attack or ranged.

3003
03:50:13,172 --> 03:50:18,071
LIAM: Great. So the bonus action I will use to
dash towards baby. And my final, hasted attack

3004
03:50:18,071 --> 03:50:25,008
action, I will stay 30 feet away from the baby,
though, in the air, and I will throw Whisper with

3005
03:50:25,008 --> 03:50:27,310
my last, hasted action.

3006
03:50:27,310 --> 03:50:31,501
MATT: Okay. There you go. Put you down there.

3007
03:50:31,501 --> 03:50:33,931
LIAM: And that's a 25, which hits, yeah?

3008
03:50:33,931 --> 03:50:36,731
MATT: That hits. That just hits, yeah.

3009
03:50:36,731 --> 03:50:42,303
LIAM: One, and can I dump Smite into this?

3010
03:50:42,303 --> 03:50:44,060
MATT: If you'd like to, yeah.

3011
03:50:44,060 --> 03:50:54,065
LIAM: I would like to. There's nine plus psychic
damage is 16 plus-- 20, 26, and here comes the

3012
03:50:54,065 --> 03:51:05,049
sneak attack damage, 26, 27, 29, 30, 33, 37, 43,
47.

3013
03:51:05,049 --> 03:51:13,930
MATT: 47? Nice. As you swipe down to (whoosh)
fling Whisper out, it slams right into the chest

3014
03:51:13,930 --> 03:51:17,853
of the creature and it impales it off the back
side and there's the burst of divine energy

3015
03:51:17,853 --> 03:51:22,195
inside, but you see the divine energy matches its
own, and what looks like a blow that would've

3016
03:51:22,195 --> 03:51:29,982
killed the creature, it's like, (raspy inhale).
Turns back towards you, and gives another scream

3017
03:51:29,982 --> 03:51:34,224
as the dagger returns to you. End of your turn?

3018
03:51:34,224 --> 03:51:35,576
LIAM: That's the end of my turn.

3019
03:51:35,576 --> 03:51:40,372
MATT: All right, at the end of your turn, it's
going to use its last legendary action. It's going

3020
03:51:40,372 --> 03:51:44,372
to use another cold snap. You feel the air around
you, familiar, (whoosh) condense, and the ice

3021
03:51:44,372 --> 03:51:48,102
cling to you. The air in your lungs freezes solid,
it seems. Go ahead and roll a

3022
03:51:48,102 --> 03:51:50,217
constitution saving throw.

3023
03:51:50,217 --> 03:51:55,513
LIAM: Going to use another Luck. 25.

3024
03:51:55,513 --> 03:52:01,037
MATT: 25 will succeed, all right. So you shrug off
the stunned effect, but you do still suffer the

3025
03:52:01,037 --> 03:52:20,619
halved damage. 13 points of cold damage. All
righty. Pike, you're up. Top of your turn, you

3026
03:52:20,619 --> 03:52:24,131
suffer no damage, because you got out of the fire.
You're at the top of the wall now.

3027
03:52:24,131 --> 03:52:35,227
ASHLEY: All right. If I climb down there, it's an
athletics thing?

3028
03:52:35,227 --> 03:52:36,827
MATT: Yes.

3029
03:52:36,827 --> 03:52:40,026
ASHLEY: Oh, okay. I'll climb down.

3030
03:52:40,026 --> 03:52:43,888
MATT: Roll an athletics check. It's 40 feet down.
So that's going to be a long climb.

3031
03:52:43,888 --> 03:52:45,674
ASHLEY: Okay.

3032
03:52:45,674 --> 03:52:49,850
LAURA: Oh no.

3033
03:52:49,850 --> 03:52:52,799
TRAVIS: Oh, is it really? Is it fucking really?

3034
03:52:52,799 --> 03:52:55,328
MATT: It's a natural one?

3035
03:52:55,328 --> 03:52:57,622
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3036
03:52:57,622 --> 03:53:01,942
TRAVIS: Who put her on the top of a 40 foot wall?

3037
03:53:01,942 --> 03:53:04,033
LAURA: Just picked her up and dropped her there.

3038
03:53:04,033 --> 03:53:05,487
ASHLEY: Wait!

3039
03:53:05,487 --> 03:53:07,342
LIAM: She can see and cast spells!

3040
03:53:07,342 --> 03:53:09,174
ASHLEY: I have Feather Fall with my shield.

3041
03:53:09,174 --> 03:53:15,336
MATT: You do. So you use your reaction to cast
Feather Fall on yourself as you stumble off the

3042
03:53:15,336 --> 03:53:25,866
side, and as you plummet about 20 or so of the 40
feet (whoosh, soft impact) and you land unscathed

3043
03:53:25,866 --> 03:53:27,299
on the ground.

3044
03:53:27,299 --> 03:53:29,429
ASHLEY: Okay. Is that just my action?

3045
03:53:29,429 --> 03:53:31,827
MATT: That's your reaction to do that. With the
shield.

3046
03:53:31,827 --> 03:53:36,109
ASHLEY: Okay. How close am I to the baby? Can I
get to the baby?

3047
03:53:36,109 --> 03:53:41,037
MATT: Not physically. It's over here and you're at
the base of the wall.

3048
03:53:41,037 --> 03:53:42,729
LIAM: It's like 50 feet.

3049
03:53:42,729 --> 03:53:43,744
ASHLEY: All right.

3050
03:53:43,744 --> 03:53:45,342
MATT: You can get within range to it.

3051
03:53:45,342 --> 03:53:49,825
ASHLEY: So you know what? I'm going to (sings)
Guiding Bolt the baby!

3052
03:53:49,825 --> 03:53:51,981
MATT: Okay, what level?

3053
03:53:51,981 --> 03:53:58,125
ASHLEY: Let's do five. 5th-level.

3054
03:53:58,125 --> 03:54:02,548
MATT: Oh, shit, okay. Go ahead and roll for an
attack on that. Wait, is Guiding Bolt an attack?

3055
03:54:02,548 --> 03:54:08,051
No, is it a saving throw? I think it's a saving
throw, isn't it? I always forget that. No, it's a

3056
03:54:08,051 --> 03:54:11,948
ranged spell attack, so you have to roll to hit
it. Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your spell

3057
03:54:11,948 --> 03:54:13,619
attack modifier.

3058
03:54:13,619 --> 03:54:22,284
ASHLEY: It's not enough I don't think. 19? I will
use Guided Strike.

3059
03:54:22,284 --> 03:54:26,632
MATT: Because you can do that! Guided Strike, you
get to add that to your own attack?

3060
03:54:26,632 --> 03:54:27,996
ASHLEY: Yep.

3061
03:54:27,996 --> 03:54:30,803
TRAVIS: Channel Divinity.

3062
03:54:30,803 --> 03:54:43,284
MATT: (laughs) Still checking it. Guided Strike.
Yeah, plus ten to the roll. That'll do it. 29,

3063
03:54:43,284 --> 03:54:45,893
boom. Go ahead and roll damage on that.

3064
03:54:45,893 --> 03:54:48,904
ASHLEY: How many sixes? Let's see.

3065
03:54:48,904 --> 03:54:52,677
MATT: Well it's four levels above that, so it's
8d6 radiant damage.

3066
03:54:52,677 --> 03:55:06,858
ASHLEY: I'll get five, six, seven, eight. Okay, so
we've got six, 12. Help me out here, guys.

3067
03:55:06,858 --> 03:55:09,444
18. Oh, wow.

3068
03:55:09,444 --> 03:55:11,376
LAURA: You rolled a lot of sixes!

3069
03:55:11,376 --> 03:55:12,906
ASHLEY: Whoa!

3070
03:55:12,906 --> 03:55:19,428
TRAVIS: She rolled six sixes.

3071
03:55:19,428 --> 03:55:21,837
MATT: Six sixes?

3072
03:55:21,837 --> 03:55:23,928
MARISHA: What do you mean?

3073
03:55:23,928 --> 03:55:25,789
LIAM: She rolled a ton of sixes.

3074
03:55:25,789 --> 03:55:27,297
ASHLEY: 42.

3075
03:55:27,297 --> 03:55:31,362
MATT: 42 points?

3076
03:55:31,362 --> 03:55:35,997
TRAVIS: I'm looking at them.

3077
03:55:35,997 --> 03:55:37,704
LAURA: They're all sixes.

3078
03:55:37,704 --> 03:55:42,706
ASHLEY: We choose to kill this celestial baby not
because it is easy, but because it is hard!

3079
03:55:42,706 --> 03:55:50,245
MATT: So as you land gently on the ground after
plummeting head over heels. (thuds, fire blast)

3080
03:55:50,245 --> 03:55:55,437
Holding your holy symbol before you, you watch as
this beam of condensed divine energy rockets

3081
03:55:55,437 --> 03:56:03,943
across, and this tiny, floating, withered planar
baby (fire blast) gets blasted. You watch as the

3082
03:56:03,943 --> 03:56:08,328
wings get pushed back. It's holding itself in
place, but you see the dark shadow outline as the

3083
03:56:08,328 --> 03:56:14,033
energy is blasting through it. As it hits, its
wings recoil, and it's still floating there, but

3084
03:56:14,033 --> 03:56:17,746
you can see this sparkly outline of divine energy,
because the next attack on it has advantage.

3085
03:56:17,746 --> 03:56:20,331
ASHLEY: Do I still have a bonus action?

3086
03:56:20,331 --> 03:56:23,192
MATT: You do. Your sword's still up.

3087
03:56:23,192 --> 03:56:25,639
ASHLEY: I'll use the spiritual weapon.

3088
03:56:25,639 --> 03:56:28,767
MATT: Spiritual weapon, you can move 20 feet as a
bonus action. It moves up and takes a swipe. Go

3089
03:56:28,767 --> 03:56:30,718
ahead and roll an attack.

3090
03:56:30,718 --> 03:56:33,961
ASHLEY: Oh crap, my boots are stuck together. How
is this happening? Okay.

3091
03:56:33,961 --> 03:56:37,192
Yeah, the hook on the top there.

3092
03:56:37,192 --> 03:56:40,189
LAURA: That's how she fell off the wall.

3093
03:56:40,189 --> 03:56:47,401
ASHLEY: Ooh. That's a 29.

3094
03:56:47,401 --> 03:56:55,629
MATT: 29 hits! Yeah, so go ahead and roll the
damage for the spiritual weapon, which is 1d8 plus

3095
03:56:55,629 --> 03:56:59,090
five, I think, for you. Whatever your wisdom
modifier is.

3096
03:56:59,090 --> 03:57:05,870
ASHLEY: Sorry, guys. I don't know what I'm doing.
Oh, that's not a lot. Seven.

3097
03:57:05,870 --> 03:57:11,106
MATT: Seven points of damage. It all helps. All
righty. Keyleth, you're up.

3098
03:57:11,106 --> 03:57:13,350
MARISHA: I'm underground, right?

3099
03:57:13,350 --> 03:57:18,314
MATT: You're underground, you are restrained, you
are blind. You cannot see anything.

3100
03:57:18,314 --> 03:57:21,428
MARISHA: (growls) I'm going to go earth
elemental.

3101
03:57:21,428 --> 03:57:22,933
MATT: Okay!

3102
03:57:22,933 --> 03:57:27,356
TALIESIN: I'm amazed he didn't already have it out
of the bag.

3103
03:57:27,356 --> 03:57:41,664
MATT: And with that ability, you get an
earthglide, and this is a non-issue for you. All

3104
03:57:41,664 --> 03:57:52,268
righty, Keyleth. So you are an earth elemental.

3105
03:57:52,268 --> 03:57:54,157
TRAVIS: Damn!

3106
03:57:54,157 --> 03:57:57,644
MARISHA: Do I have enough movement to earthglide
to them?

3107
03:57:57,644 --> 03:57:59,010
MATT: What's your speed?

3108
03:57:59,010 --> 03:58:00,719
MARISHA: I think 60, earthglide?

3109
03:58:00,719 --> 03:58:05,329
MATT: 60, earthglide? Yeah, totally. You're moving
into melee with the baby?

3110
03:58:05,329 --> 03:58:13,322
MARISHA: Okay, can I come up from underground,
grab them, and then beat them into the ground?

3111
03:58:13,322 --> 03:58:15,683
MATT: Sure. Go ahead and roll a slam attack.

3112
03:58:15,683 --> 03:58:17,278
TALIESIN: Puny god!

3113
03:58:17,278 --> 03:58:22,842
MATT: Make two slam attacks, so roll twice. It's
plus eight to attack each time.

3114
03:58:22,842 --> 03:58:31,227
MARISHA: That's cocked. Natural 20 on that one,
and a four on a second one, which is 12.

3115
03:58:31,227 --> 03:58:32,654
MATT: Yeah, that misses.

3116
03:58:32,654 --> 03:58:34,936
MARISHA; Okay, but that one is a natural 20.

3117
03:58:34,936 --> 03:58:38,887
MATT: As you reach up out of the ground from
underneath, (impact noise) your fingers clasp

3118
03:58:38,887 --> 03:58:45,996
around the celestial baby and (whack) slam it into
the ground as hard as you can. Go ahead and roll

3119
03:58:45,996 --> 03:58:51,665
damage on that. 2d8 plus five, so roll the 2d8.

3120
03:58:51,665 --> 03:58:54,085
MARISHA: And then you double the 2d8.

3121
03:58:54,085 --> 03:59:00,117
MATT: You double whatever you rol for the 2d8 and
then add plus five. Crit that baby. It's our next

3122
03:59:00,191 --> 03:59:02,099
t-shirt: Crit that baby!

3123
03:59:02,099 --> 03:59:08,791
MARISHA: Six doubled, which is 12, plus five
doubled, which is ten, so that's 22.

3124
03:59:08,791 --> 03:59:10,985
MATT: The bonus isn't doubled. Just the dice.

3125
03:59:10,985 --> 03:59:16,273
MARISHA: I know. Just the dice is 22, plus five.
So 27.

3126
03:59:16,273 --> 03:59:23,169
MATT: That's great. 27 points of damage. (wham)
Slamming onto the ground. As your hand retracts

3127
03:59:23,169 --> 03:59:29,729
up, you can see the wings are-- as it starts to
fly up, it (gasps).

3128
03:59:29,729 --> 03:59:34,572
MARISHA: And I just want to hold onto it and be
like, yo! Yo, air elemental! And then let my air

3129
03:59:34,572 --> 03:59:38,684
elemental come over and do its thing. Double slam
attack.

3130
03:59:38,684 --> 03:59:39,876
MATT: Go for it.

3131
03:59:39,876 --> 03:59:48,760
MARISHA: Slam attack. No, I'm going to do a multi
attack. Two slam attacks. So 2d8 plus eight, once

3132
03:59:48,760 --> 03:59:54,192
again. That's an 18 and a 17. Plus eight.

3133
03:59:54,192 --> 03:59:55,818
MATT: 18 and 17 plus eight?

3134
03:59:55,818 --> 03:59:58,261
MARISHA: Yeah, so 26 and 25.

3135
03:59:58,261 --> 04:00:00,486
MATT: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

3136
04:00:00,486 --> 04:00:17,515
MARISHA: Which is 3d8 plus two. So the first one,
oh! Six, seven, eight, plus seven, which is 15.

3137
04:00:17,515 --> 04:00:29,893
For the first one, 15 plus two. 17. And then the
second one is eight, plus two fives, which is 18

3138
04:00:29,893 --> 04:00:31,971
plus two, so 20.

3139
04:00:31,971 --> 04:00:33,332
MATT: Nice.

3140
04:00:33,332 --> 04:00:35,973
TALIESIN: And he gets flung in a random
direction?

3141
04:00:35,973 --> 04:00:44,679
MATT: No, this was just hitting it. (impacts) All
righty. That's the end of your turn? All right. As

3142
04:00:44,679 --> 04:00:51,561
it comes back to the entity's turn, it's looking
really, really rough. And as part of that, it's

3143
04:00:51,561 --> 04:01:02,037
going to reach into itself. Its hands push into
its torso, and as it screams, (raspy scream) it

3144
04:01:02,037 --> 04:01:05,910
gives out this horrible scream as it tears some of
its chest open, and from the inside, where you

3145
04:01:05,910 --> 04:01:12,212
imagine it would be a ribcage, it's this
impossibly bright light that echoes out in a

3146
04:01:12,212 --> 04:01:18,997
shockwave, affecting everybody except for Vex,
actually. I need everybody else to make a

3147
04:01:18,997 --> 04:01:20,786
constitution saving throw.

3148
04:01:20,786 --> 04:01:21,829
TALIESIN: All of us?

3149
04:01:21,829 --> 04:01:23,047
MATT: Yes.

3150
04:01:23,047 --> 04:01:26,582
SAM: Oh boy. That don't look good.

3151
04:01:26,582 --> 04:01:29,091
TALIESIN: We don't have advantage on this, do we?

3152
04:01:29,091 --> 04:01:30,179
MATT: Nope!

3153
04:01:30,179 --> 04:01:33,774
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn a Resolve.

3154
04:01:33,774 --> 04:01:44,464
MARISHA: Constitution: that's part of my physical
stats as being an elemental, correct? It's con,

3155
04:01:44,464 --> 04:01:48,311
strength, and dex. Never mind. Yeah.

3156
04:01:48,311 --> 04:01:53,737
MATT: So?

3157
04:01:53,737 --> 04:01:54,868
SAM: 22.

3158
04:01:54,868 --> 04:01:56,422
MATT: 22. That succeeds.

3159
04:01:56,422 --> 04:01:57,700
TALIESIN: 17.

3160
04:01:57,700 --> 04:01:59,162
MARISHA: 15.

3161
04:01:59,162 --> 04:02:00,170
LIAM: 24.

3162
04:02:00,170 --> 04:02:04,676
MATT: That succeeds. Pike?

3163
04:02:04,676 --> 04:02:06,498
ASHLEY: 11.

3164
04:02:06,498 --> 04:02:07,462
MATT: Okay.

3165
04:02:07,462 --> 04:02:08,411
TRAVIS: 25.

3166
04:02:08,411 --> 04:02:14,282
MATT: Succeeds. Everyone who succeeds, you suffer
48 points of radiant damage.

3167
04:02:14,282 --> 04:02:15,890
SAM: Radiant damage?

3168
04:02:15,890 --> 04:02:16,935
MATT: Yes.

3169
04:02:16,935 --> 04:02:21,852
LIAM: 48 on a success. Whoa.

3170
04:02:21,852 --> 04:02:25,272
MATT: If you failed, you took 96 points of radiant
damage.

3171
04:02:25,272 --> 04:02:31,824
TALIESIN: Wait, that's magical. I have advantage.
The cloak wouldn't--

3172
04:02:31,824 --> 04:02:34,464
MATT: The cloak doesn't say a spell effect?

3173
04:02:34,464 --> 04:02:39,139
TALIESIN: Against spells and other magical
effects.

3174
04:02:39,139 --> 04:02:45,000
MATT: Technically, because it's not a leveled
spell, it's just a radiant blast, it would not

3175
04:02:45,000 --> 04:02:45,807
affect it.

3176
04:02:45,807 --> 04:02:47,450
TALIESIN: It wouldn't have given me advantage on
that save?

3177
04:02:47,450 --> 04:02:48,515
MATT: No, it wouldn't.

3178
04:02:48,515 --> 04:02:51,521
ASHLEY: 96, you said?

3179
04:02:51,521 --> 04:03:00,426
MATT: 96 points of radiant damage. So Keyleth, I
need you-- your elemental has gone berserk.

3180
04:03:00,426 --> 04:03:02,042
MARISHA: There's no way.

3181
04:03:02,042 --> 04:03:04,187
MATT: Aside of rolling a 20. Go for it. Just try.

3182
04:03:04,187 --> 04:03:11,464
MARISHA: Unless I roll a nat 20? They just do
their own thing if you fail.

3183
04:03:11,464 --> 04:03:15,040
TRAVIS: What do you got to roll, a 20? Percy,
bless that shit.

3184
04:03:15,040 --> 04:03:19,154
MATT: Even so, I'm letting you have this
opportunity.

3185
04:03:19,154 --> 04:03:22,562
MARISHA: I rolled a 19.

3186
04:03:22,562 --> 04:03:29,161
MATT: Nope. So as the Conjure Elemental spell
fails, the control of your elemental shifts, and

3187
04:03:29,161 --> 04:03:32,411
now it's aggressively turning its attention
towards you and the rest of your party.

3188
04:03:32,411 --> 04:03:36,277
MARISHA: Can I not fade it after this? Oh, I can
drop concentration on it

3189
04:03:36,277 --> 04:03:39,011
and then it will go away, right?

3190
04:03:39,011 --> 04:03:41,074
MATT: No. That's not how this works.

3191
04:03:41,074 --> 04:03:42,561
TRAVIS: Did you just put--

3192
04:03:42,561 --> 04:03:44,045
LIAM: A new enemy on the map.

3193
04:03:44,045 --> 04:03:46,608
SAM: A new opponent enters.

3194
04:03:46,608 --> 04:03:51,682
MARISHA: To be fair, didn't it also get affected
by the blast?

3195
04:03:51,682 --> 04:03:59,941
MATT: Yeah, actually. Roll a constitution saving
throw for the air elemental. It's a plus two.

3196
04:03:59,941 --> 04:04:08,059
MARISHA: I rolled a 13, plus two, so 15.

3197
04:04:08,059 --> 04:04:12,737
MATT: The air elemental is actually destroyed. To
your advantage, strangely.

3198
04:04:12,737 --> 04:04:17,518
MARISHA: It only has 90 hit points, so it's fine,
guys! It's fine.

3199
04:04:17,518 --> 04:04:27,327
MATT: All right, so the entity looks like it's
barely hanging on, and you see parts of its

3200
04:04:27,327 --> 04:04:32,265
internal body falling out from where it tore its
chest open. It's going to use a bonus action to

3201
04:04:32,265 --> 04:04:42,102
Misty Step out of this vicinity over to here. It's
going to use its movement to fly high up, almost

3202
04:04:42,102 --> 04:04:52,334
trying to escape the cavern now. It's up in that
region right there. We'll say, here. On top of

3203
04:04:52,334 --> 04:04:55,159
this. Turn that away.

3204
04:04:55,159 --> 04:04:57,542
LAURA: Oh, look how teeny! I can finally see it.

3205
04:04:57,542 --> 04:04:59,152
ASHLEY: Above a fountain.

3206
04:04:59,152 --> 04:05:00,997
LIAM: It's a faerie dragon.

3207
04:05:00,997 --> 04:05:02,203
LAURA: It's so teeny.

3208
04:05:02,203 --> 04:05:03,973
MATT: All righty. Vex, you're up.

3209
04:05:03,973 --> 04:05:10,985
LAURA: I guess I'll fly up so I can see over the
wall. I have no idea what's going on.

3210
04:05:10,985 --> 04:05:15,210
MATT: You fly up and you see everyone below is
wrecked, the ground is charred with some sort of a

3211
04:05:15,210 --> 04:05:22,732
radiant blast. You watched it flash over the wall
itself, like a small, rapid recreation of the

3212
04:05:22,732 --> 04:05:27,563
intro of Akira. (boom) This big, arcing ball of
white energy.

3213
04:05:27,563 --> 04:05:31,630
LAURA: Wow. Can I Hunter's Mark the baby?

3214
04:05:31,630 --> 04:05:32,699
MATT: Sure.

3215
04:05:32,699 --> 04:05:51,501
LAURA: And then I'm going to try to shoot the baby
with my Blazing Bowstring. That would be a 30. And

3216
04:05:51,501 --> 04:05:53,466
I'm going to make it a bramble shot.

3217
04:05:53,466 --> 04:05:54,838
MATT: Okay.

3218
04:05:54,838 --> 04:05:58,636
LIAM: Ball of vines in the air.

3219
04:05:58,636 --> 04:06:00,499
LAURA: DC of 17.

3220
04:06:00,499 --> 04:06:02,647
MATT: Strength?

3221
04:06:02,647 --> 04:06:03,814
LAURA: Yeah.

3222
04:06:03,814 --> 04:06:05,651
MATT: I actually rolled a natural 17.

3223
04:06:05,651 --> 04:06:07,645
LAURA: Motherfucker. Okay, well.

3224
04:06:07,645 --> 04:06:09,018
MATT: But it still takes the damage.

3225
04:06:09,018 --> 04:06:27,523
LAURA: Still 4d8 extra. Well. 17, plus five is 22,
plus eight is 30, plus two is 32, plus 1d6

3226
04:06:27,523 --> 04:06:37,740
lightning damage... 35, plus 1d6 for Hunter's Mark
is 40.

3227
04:06:37,740 --> 04:06:44,166
MATT: 40, nice! So as it hits, you watch as the
brambles try and wrap around it, but it actually

3228
04:06:44,166 --> 04:06:45,396
flies free.

3229
04:06:45,396 --> 04:06:50,580
LAURA: Oh wait! Plus the blazing bowstring,
another two fire damage.

3230
04:06:50,580 --> 04:06:58,714
MATT: 42 total. You can see more of it's just
falling out of its small, decomposing torso, and

3231
04:06:58,714 --> 04:07:03,637
it's trying to fly upward now, towards the light.
It's on the edge.

3232
04:07:03,637 --> 04:07:06,154
LAURA: I want to try to do the same thing again.

3233
04:07:06,154 --> 04:07:07,470
MATT: Okay, go for it.

3234
04:07:07,470 --> 04:07:13,873
LAURA: With a Blazing Bowstring again. 28.

3235
04:07:13,873 --> 04:07:15,310
MATT: 28 hits. Roll damage.

3236
04:07:15,310 --> 04:07:25,661
LAURA: Okay, bramble shot again, because I get
two, motherfucker! That's ten for my Blazing

3237
04:07:25,661 --> 04:07:56,114
Bowstring. Oh, Jesus H. Macy. 19, plus five is 24,
plus eight is 32, 36. Oh my god, 34. 38,

3238
04:07:56,114 --> 04:08:01,204
plus ten is 48.

3239
04:08:01,204 --> 04:08:02,596
MATT: How do you want to do this?

3240
04:08:02,596 --> 04:08:04,615
(cheering)

3241
04:08:04,615 --> 04:08:08,491
TRAVIS: Frozen no more! Freeze me at your peril!

3242
04:08:08,491 --> 04:08:14,827
LAURA: Be free, little angel baby. We shall feast
tonight! That's so gross.

3243
04:08:14,827 --> 04:08:18,845
And I just shoot the baby.

3244
04:08:18,845 --> 04:08:27,780
MATT: All right. As you pull back as it's
fluttering up, you take aim and release, and as

3245
04:08:27,780 --> 04:08:34,234
the arrow strikes it, you can see, the same way
the dagger hit the baby, it hits it, and throws

3246
04:08:34,234 --> 04:08:38,795
it, the sheer force of the arrow against the wall,
and pins it there like it's stapled to the rock.

3247
04:08:38,795 --> 04:08:46,087
As it reaches over to try and pull the arrow out,
and it begins to, suddenly the arrow (whoosh)

3248
04:08:46,087 --> 04:08:50,683
breaks into a bunch of bramble vines that begin to
wrap around it, and you watch as the tiny baby arm

3249
04:08:50,683 --> 04:08:57,595
and wing try and reach out (choking) as it
constricts and twists and slowly constrains it

3250
04:08:57,595 --> 04:09:05,429
until you see it (crack) pop and go limp on the
inside of the vines. And as the vines unfurl, what

3251
04:09:05,429 --> 04:09:14,804
was physically there is slowly dissipating into a
glitter-like powder. The body dissipating and

3252
04:09:14,804 --> 04:09:16,046
falling apart.

3253
04:09:16,046 --> 04:09:17,858
LAURA: I mean, it was an evil baby, right?

3254
04:09:17,858 --> 04:09:19,109
TRAVIS: Yeah, nobody likes glitter.

3255
04:09:19,109 --> 04:09:20,952
MARISHA: Yeah, glitter gets everywhere.

3256
04:09:20,952 --> 04:09:25,501
LAURA: Should we get out of here?

3257
04:09:25,501 --> 04:09:27,923
TRAVIS: (muffled) I don't mean to be rude!

3258
04:09:27,923 --> 04:09:33,203
MARISHA: I run over to Grog. I'm still an
elemental, yeah? I am still an elemental.

3259
04:09:33,203 --> 04:09:34,502
Where is he?

3260
04:09:34,502 --> 04:09:35,866
MATT: You don't know, actually.

3261
04:09:35,866 --> 04:09:39,249
SAM: I saw it. I'll point down.

3262
04:09:39,249 --> 04:09:41,767
MARISHA: You point. I earthglide and I find him.

3263
04:09:41,767 --> 04:09:42,896
MATT: Okay.

3264
04:09:42,896 --> 04:09:47,003
MARISHA: And I can do double damage to structures.
Can I beat him out?

3265
04:09:47,003 --> 04:09:51,173
MATT: I'd say you could probably, over time, yeah.
You have enough constitution to be fine.

3266
04:09:51,173 --> 04:09:53,490
MARISHA: I don't want to kill him by suffocating.

3267
04:09:53,490 --> 04:09:57,086
MATT: No, he's fine. He can hold his breath for
six minutes. He's got a really high constitution,

3268
04:09:57,086 --> 04:10:03,606
so you're fine. You slowly pummel the rock out
from his way and pull Grog out from the interior

3269
04:10:03,606 --> 04:10:05,123
of the stone floor.

3270
04:10:05,123 --> 04:10:08,886
TALIESIN: Yeah, we should head out and bug bomb
the place.

3271
04:10:08,886 --> 04:10:10,270
TRAVIS: Don't we need proof?

3272
04:10:10,270 --> 04:10:11,574
TALIESIN: Grab the body. Let's go.

3273
04:10:11,574 --> 04:10:13,001
SAM: There's no body!

3274
04:10:13,001 --> 04:10:19,725
MARISHA: I go over to the glitter and I get some
of my potion bottles from my alchemy to--

3275
04:10:19,725 --> 04:10:25,234
Oh, I'm actually good at this. I try and
harvest some, sweep some glitter.

3276
04:10:25,234 --> 04:10:29,397
MATT: Okay. So you gather some glitter in.

3277
04:10:29,463 --> 04:10:33,745
TALIESIN: Really quick, just look around, is there
anything of value to grab before we run?

3278
04:10:33,745 --> 04:10:35,576
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3279
04:10:35,576 --> 04:10:36,987
SAM: I'll look, too.

3280
04:10:36,987 --> 04:10:42,603
LAURA: While she's doing that, can I just look
over the ground and see

3281
04:10:42,653 --> 04:10:45,185
if there's any platinum deposits?

3282
04:10:45,185 --> 04:10:48,399
SAM: We could do a quick mining.

3283
04:10:48,399 --> 04:10:51,804
MATT: I mean, there are a number of visible edges
of veins.

3284
04:10:51,804 --> 04:10:54,862
LIAM: Is there 230,000 gold worth?

3285
04:10:54,862 --> 04:10:58,127
SAM: Probably. We could stay here for a couple
months.

3286
04:10:58,127 --> 04:11:06,213
MATT: In this whole mine, there's a lot of
platinum, but you have to mine it. And as you guys

3287
04:11:06,213 --> 04:11:18,773
are having this moment, you begin to hear the loud
sound of hundreds of large insect-like creatures

3288
04:11:18,773 --> 04:11:21,015
climbing their way down the walls.

3289
04:11:21,015 --> 04:11:23,494
LAURA: Oh god. Get to the middle and get in the
air.

3290
04:11:23,494 --> 04:11:27,776
MARISHA: Okay, so I get everybody in the middle.
Is everyone ready?

3291
04:11:27,776 --> 04:11:29,026
TRAVIS: I need help.

3292
04:11:29,026 --> 04:11:30,493
TALIESIN: We pulled you out.

3293
04:11:30,493 --> 04:11:32,267
MARISHA: What do you mean, you need help?

3294
04:11:32,267 --> 04:11:34,063
TRAVIS: I'm on the other side of the 40-foot wall
from the carpet.

3295
04:11:34,063 --> 04:11:40,006
MARISHA: I go (boom) and I pull Grog through.

3296
04:11:40,006 --> 04:11:44,505
LAURA: No, the carpet. We just got to get the
carpet. I can go down and grab the carpet.

3297
04:11:44,505 --> 04:11:49,596
MARISHA: Oh, the carpet. I take a few minutes as
my earth elemental self to beast through...

3298
04:11:49,596 --> 04:11:51,293
LAURA: We don't have a few minutes.

3299
04:11:51,293 --> 04:11:53,064
MARISHA: I can do double damage to structures.

3300
04:11:53,064 --> 04:11:56,591
LAURA: You don't have to do that. I can go get the
carpet. I'm right there.

3301
04:11:56,591 --> 04:11:58,340
MARISHA: Oh, okay. Go get the carpet.

3302
04:11:58,340 --> 04:12:02,050
MATT: Okay. So you rush over and grab the carpet.
And you guys begin to make

3303
04:12:02,050 --> 04:12:03,685
your way back up through.

3304
04:12:03,685 --> 04:12:05,405
LAURA: Are we bamfing out or are we flying up?

3305
04:12:05,405 --> 04:12:09,277
TALIESIN: I think we're flying up and if we see
anything we'll just take shots at anything that's

3306
04:12:09,277 --> 04:12:13,812
rolling around, if anything is visible. Let's just
do damage on our way out.

3307
04:12:13,812 --> 04:12:17,053
MARISHA: Oh, we're doing damage as we fly out.

3308
04:12:17,053 --> 04:12:18,441
LIAM: Or we could Tree Stride out?

3309
04:12:18,441 --> 04:12:20,449
TALIESIN: We can't Tree Stride. There's no trees.

3310
04:12:20,449 --> 04:12:24,423
LAURA: Or we can Plane Shift.

3311
04:12:24,423 --> 04:12:28,787
MATT: There is a small tree growing out of the
side of the wall from where you killed the

3312
04:12:28,787 --> 04:12:31,791
creature, but it's not large enough for that
spell.

3313
04:12:31,791 --> 04:12:33,959
LAURA: But still really cool!

3314
04:12:33,959 --> 04:12:37,299
MATT: Yeah, it grows and twists out, like a bonsai
curves upward.

3315
04:12:37,299 --> 04:12:40,737
LAURA: I hope that it slowly becomes a forest
underground.

3316
04:12:40,737 --> 04:12:43,576
TRAVIS: They're going to chop it down as they mine
the platinum.

3317
04:12:43,576 --> 04:12:47,669
MATT: All right, so you guys are coasting up
through the shaft?

3318
04:12:47,669 --> 04:12:49,855
MARISHA: Oh, are we just riding up?

3319
04:12:49,855 --> 04:12:51,962
TRAVIS: Straight up.

3320
04:12:51,962 --> 04:12:53,734
MARISHA: Broom and carpet? Broom and carpet.

3321
04:12:53,734 --> 04:13:00,031
MATT: Okay. You guys begin heading up through the
center column of this opening. As you're moving

3322
04:13:00,031 --> 04:13:04,294
up, are you staying in the darkness?

3323
04:13:04,294 --> 04:13:08,049
LAURA: Can you Daylight or something, like up and
out?

3324
04:13:08,049 --> 04:13:10,173
MARISHA: I can. Do we need to?

3325
04:13:10,173 --> 04:13:14,027
TALIESIN: You know, at this point, it might be.

3326
04:13:14,027 --> 04:13:18,542
MARISHA: On the top of my spire I cast Daylight.

3327
04:13:18,542 --> 04:13:26,018
MATT: Okay. So (boom) this light now emerges from
this area, and as you can see now through this

3328
04:13:26,018 --> 04:13:39,098
cavern around you, there's about a dozen or so of
these large ankheg creatures, about every 30 feet

3329
04:13:39,098 --> 04:13:46,734
or so, 40 feet up. You're in the center of-- you
look up and you can see easily the hundred that

3330
04:13:46,734 --> 04:13:50,950
you saw earlier have all been drawn to the surface
by the screams of this creature. And as you begin

3331
04:13:50,950 --> 04:13:55,125
rocketing up with this Daylight spell, you watch
as some of them start hanging upward in your

3332
04:13:55,125 --> 04:13:58,503
direction. You start hearing this sound, (hiss).

3333
04:13:58,503 --> 04:14:02,910
MARISHA: Are they attracted to the Daylight?

3334
04:14:02,910 --> 04:14:10,513
MATT: They're apparently attracted to your
presence. It is a line shot. I'm going to go ahead

3335
04:14:10,513 --> 04:14:19,042
and have, let's see here. Percy and Vex, I need
you guys to both make a

3336
04:14:19,042 --> 04:14:21,355
constitution saving throw.

3337
04:14:21,355 --> 04:14:35,527
TRAVIS: Oh shit. Oh god, we did not-- pretty sure
you said that last time, before you turned into

3338
04:14:35,527 --> 04:14:36,941
Chef Boyardee.

3339
04:14:36,941 --> 04:14:39,346
MATT: Sorry, sorry, not constitution. Dexterity,
my apologies.

3340
04:14:39,346 --> 04:14:42,288
LAURA: Dexterity saving throw? That is so much
better.

3341
04:14:42,288 --> 04:14:45,859
TALIESIN: Should I reroll? Yeah, I'll reroll.

3342
04:14:45,859 --> 04:14:48,048
LAURA: Should you reroll?

3343
04:14:48,048 --> 04:14:49,757
MATT: Yeah, roll again; it's fine.

3344
04:14:49,757 --> 04:14:51,854
LAURA: 27.

3345
04:14:51,854 --> 04:14:53,635
TALIESIN: 18.

3346
04:14:53,635 --> 04:14:57,798
MATT: Yeah, you both make it. So you both suffer
eight points of acid damage.

3347
04:14:57,798 --> 04:15:06,789
TALIESIN: I want to start taking shots as high up
as I can see,

3348
04:15:06,789 --> 04:15:08,980
I want to start taking shots at these things.

3349
04:15:08,980 --> 04:15:10,823
LAURA: Yeah, I'll do the same thing.

3350
04:15:10,823 --> 04:15:17,318
MATT: There are over a hundred. And they take more
than a few shots to go. We'll say you start

3351
04:15:17,389 --> 04:15:21,272
picking them off, a few as you go, but you watch
them fall past you. There's just such a mass

3352
04:15:21,272 --> 04:15:28,054
number of them. As you guys get up another 40 or
so feet, (spray sound) again. From three different

3353
04:15:28,054 --> 04:15:34,350
ones. All right, I need Taryon, Percival, and Vex
again to make dexterity saving throws.

3354
04:15:34,350 --> 04:15:35,713
SAM: Natural 20!

3355
04:15:35,713 --> 04:15:37,585
MATT and TRAVIS: Nice!

3356
04:15:37,585 --> 04:15:41,290
TALIESIN: I'll live with that. 17.

3357
04:15:41,290 --> 04:15:42,651
MATT: Okay.

3358
04:15:42,651 --> 04:15:44,865
LAURA: 23.

3359
04:15:44,865 --> 04:15:47,369
MATT: Okay, six points of acid damage to the three
of you.

3360
04:15:47,369 --> 04:15:49,792
SAM: Halved to three for me.

3361
04:15:49,792 --> 04:15:55,802
MATT: You make your way up even further. You're
about halfway up this tunnel at this point and now

3362
04:15:55,802 --> 04:16:06,964
you're getting to the heavy cluster of these
creatures. At this point, a large cluster of them

3363
04:16:06,964 --> 04:16:22,898
begin to spray all across. I need all of you guys
to make two dexterity saving throws. Anybody get

3364
04:16:22,898 --> 04:16:24,587
lower than a 13?

3365
04:16:24,587 --> 04:16:25,528
TALIESIN: Nope.

3366
04:16:25,528 --> 04:16:27,312
ASHLEY and TRAVIS: I did.

3367
04:16:27,312 --> 04:16:28,428
MATT: For one?

3368
04:16:28,428 --> 04:16:29,854
TRAVIS: For the second one.

3369
04:16:29,854 --> 04:16:31,170
MARISHA: Lower than a 13?

3370
04:16:31,170 --> 04:16:39,759
MATT: Yeah. That would be all of you except for
Pike and Grog take a total of 14 points of acid

3371
04:16:39,759 --> 04:16:49,743
damage. Both of you guys, for the purposes of
this, take 21 points of acid damage.

3372
04:16:49,743 --> 04:16:52,448
SAM: You okay there, Pikey-pants?

3373
04:16:52,448 --> 04:16:54,692
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm fine!

3374
04:16:54,692 --> 04:16:55,899
TRAVIS: I'm okay.

3375
04:16:55,899 --> 04:17:00,767
MATT: As you're shooting and you hear the gunfire
(gunshots) going off, you fire the arrows. More

3376
04:17:00,767 --> 04:17:04,591
and more of these ankhegs are falling and
crumbling off. You hear the (screeching) as they

3377
04:17:04,642 --> 04:17:08,519
streak past you, plummeting into the darkness
below. Even more so, throwing streams out.

3378
04:17:08,519 --> 04:17:11,072
However, their numbers are starting to thin
because you've gone past the thick part of it.

3379
04:17:11,072 --> 04:17:27,383
Vax, Pike, and Grog. The three of you guys roll
dexterity saving throws, please.

3380
04:17:27,383 --> 04:17:34,780
TRAVIS: 12.

3381
04:17:34,780 --> 04:17:35,775
LIAM: 19.

3382
04:17:35,775 --> 04:17:36,764
ASHLEY: 18.

3383
04:17:36,764 --> 04:17:37,762
TRAVIS: 12.

3384
04:17:37,762 --> 04:17:42,640
MATT: All right. Six points of acid damage, six points
of acid damage, 12 points of acid damage.

3385
04:17:42,706 --> 04:17:46,736
LAURA: How much further do we have to go up?!

3386
04:17:46,736 --> 04:17:53,271
MATT: You guys, with the brooms and the carpet,
it's not super fast. Putting up there again. You

3387
04:17:53,271 --> 04:17:54,780
get about three-quarters of the way up.

3388
04:17:54,780 --> 04:17:56,033
SAM: What is Pike riding on?

3389
04:17:56,033 --> 04:17:57,437
MATT: She's on the carpet.

3390
04:17:57,437 --> 04:17:59,196
ASHLEY: I'm on the carpet. I'm okay.

3391
04:17:59,196 --> 04:18:00,885
LAURA: You should heal yourself!

3392
04:18:00,885 --> 04:18:01,841
ASHLEY: I know.

3393
04:18:01,841 --> 04:18:04,686
MARISHA: Can I do a Wind Wall to protect us from
around us?

3394
04:18:04,686 --> 04:18:10,066
MATT: Wind Wall is stationary. It might help with
one round of the spray.

3395
04:18:10,066 --> 04:18:12,525
MARISHA: Are we doing one more round?

3396
04:18:12,525 --> 04:18:15,650
MATT: You'll find out. You don't know.

3397
04:18:15,650 --> 04:18:21,070
MARISHA: If we are, I will prep my Wind Wall spell
to encompass us for one more round.

3398
04:18:21,070 --> 04:18:25,315
MATT: Okay. As you guys are heading upward, now
you're about three-quarters of the way out. The

3399
04:18:25,315 --> 04:18:29,216
numbers are thinning a little bit. They start
spraying once more. You go ahead and create a Wind

3400
04:18:29,216 --> 04:18:36,013
Wall that you've been preparing. As you watch,
these jets of extremely acidic burning liquid

3401
04:18:36,013 --> 04:18:41,912
shoot toward you, suddenly a column of wind gets
conjured upward from the darkness and deflects the

3402
04:18:41,912 --> 04:18:47,340
spray into a mist that is thrown back against the
wall harmlessly. You're almost to the exit, and

3403
04:18:47,340 --> 04:18:57,779
you see a handful more towards the very top of
this cavern. Keyleth, Percy, and Pike. Make a

3404
04:18:57,779 --> 04:18:59,580
dexterity saving throw, if you can.

3405
04:18:59,580 --> 04:19:01,447
SAM: Pikey.

3406
04:19:01,447 --> 04:19:04,566
MARISHA: I'm good. 21.

3407
04:19:04,566 --> 04:19:07,734
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn a reroll. It's the end
of my resolves!

3408
04:19:07,734 --> 04:19:10,687
ASHLEY: Oh! Natural 20.

3409
04:19:10,687 --> 04:19:12,960
TALIESIN: Ten.

3410
04:19:12,960 --> 04:19:18,884
MATT: Okay, so eight points of acid damage. 16.
Keyleth?

3411
04:19:18,884 --> 04:19:21,135
MARISHA: 21.

3412
04:19:21,135 --> 04:19:27,148
MATT: All right. That's eight points of acid
damage. You took the--

3413
04:19:27,148 --> 04:19:29,441
ASHLEY: Eight.

3414
04:19:29,441 --> 04:19:34,730
MATT: The eight, yeah. As you guys just crest out
of the top of the dark column below, you can watch

3415
04:19:34,730 --> 04:19:39,888
as the creatures are starting to skitter out from
the edges, but you are far above and a few of them

3416
04:19:39,888 --> 04:19:45,346
are spraying, but you're above the range and it's
coasting over and disappearing below. You've now

3417
04:19:45,346 --> 04:19:49,517
emerged into the night sky, the moonlight above
you. You're all fairly beaten.

3418
04:19:49,517 --> 04:19:54,287
TALIESIN: Is there anything we can throw down
there to really piss them off?

3419
04:19:54,287 --> 04:20:00,027
SAM: I'll drop a bead of Firewall.

3420
04:20:00,027 --> 04:20:02,577
MARISHA: Yeah, and I can drop a Fireball on
there.

3421
04:20:02,577 --> 04:20:04,891
SAM: I'm sorry, a Wall of Fire.

3422
04:20:04,891 --> 04:20:07,380
MATT: You're going to throw a Wall of Fire on the
edge of it?

3423
04:20:07,380 --> 04:20:08,317
SAM: Yeah.

3424
04:20:08,317 --> 04:20:14,135
MARISHA: Yeah, and I'll throw a Fireball. Burn the
place down. Extermination.

3425
04:20:14,135 --> 04:20:15,911
TALIESIN: Bug bomb.

3426
04:20:15,911 --> 04:20:17,646
TRAVIS: I spit in the hole.

3427
04:20:17,646 --> 04:20:23,608
ASHLEY: I was going to see if I could put a Blade
Barrier on top of the hole, so once the fire's in

3428
04:20:23,678 --> 04:20:25,360
there, they can't get out.

3429
04:20:25,360 --> 04:20:27,403
MATT: What's the radius on Blade Barrier?

3430
04:20:27,403 --> 04:20:36,137
ASHLEY: 90 feet.

3431
04:20:36,137 --> 04:20:41,423
MATT: Okay, we'll say as you come out the top, you
throw down the Blade Barrier-- what's the radius

3432
04:20:41,423 --> 04:20:42,382
of it, though?

3433
04:20:42,382 --> 04:20:44,313
ASHLEY: I don't think it says.

3434
04:20:44,313 --> 04:20:45,485
MATT: I'll pull it up real fast.

3435
04:20:45,485 --> 04:20:47,481
ASHLEY: Oh, it does say.

3436
04:20:47,519 --> 04:20:54,617
LAURA: 60 feet in diameter. No! You can make a
straight wall of 100 feet or 60 feet in diameter.

3437
04:20:54,617 --> 04:20:56,296
ASHLEY: Yeah, ringed wall up to 60 feet.

3438
04:20:56,296 --> 04:21:01,012
MATT: Okay, so you can make a wall around the one
side of it. Not the whole thing.

3439
04:21:01,012 --> 04:21:02,251
SAM: Wall of Fire around the other?

3440
04:21:02,251 --> 04:21:11,759
MATT: You don't get to get the whole radius, but
between the Wall of Fire and the bladed wall, you

3441
04:21:11,759 --> 04:21:20,329
blast the opening there. You coast away, watching
and hearing as dozens of ankhegs that are climbing

3442
04:21:20,329 --> 04:21:28,659
up to the top begin to (screeching). Eventually,
they all begin to burrow back into the rock and

3443
04:21:28,659 --> 04:21:34,152
stone and vanish. The ones on the surface begin to
burrow below. And a calm stillness comes over the

3444
04:21:34,152 --> 04:21:39,335
exterior of the mines. As you all coast up,
hundreds of feet in the air over the forest,

3445
04:21:39,335 --> 04:21:44,837
licking your wounds. So you removed the glitter
and you removed--

3446
04:21:44,837 --> 04:21:46,217
LAURA: The little coffin.

3447
04:21:46,217 --> 04:21:49,768
MATT: The little stone placard. You had to wedge
it out, but you got it up there.

3448
04:21:49,768 --> 04:21:50,727
LAURA: Okay.

3449
04:21:50,727 --> 04:21:52,552
MATT: And that's where we'll call it for the
night.

3450
04:21:52,552 --> 04:21:53,740
TRAVIS: Nice!

3451
04:21:53,740 --> 04:21:55,753
MARISHA: That was awesome!

3452
04:21:55,753 --> 04:21:59,984
TALIESIN: I'm at 57 hit points. Yay.

3453
04:21:59,984 --> 04:22:02,534
TRAVIS: Add 100 to that and that's somewhere
Grog.

3454
04:22:02,534 --> 04:22:06,279
TALIESIN: Where were you at? I feared for you,
man.

3455
04:22:06,279 --> 04:22:07,424
ASHLEY: 11.

3456
04:22:07,424 --> 04:22:08,595
LAURA: Oh my god!

3457
04:22:08,595 --> 04:22:12,586
TRAVIS: That cherub was a bitch.

3458
04:22:12,586 --> 04:22:18,130
MATT: Aw man. That was also created by the chat.

3459
04:22:18,130 --> 04:22:19,439
TRAVIS: Was it?!

3460
04:22:19,439 --> 04:22:22,030
LAURA: The baby was created by the chat?!

3461
04:22:22,030 --> 04:22:23,658
TRAVIS: Why you do this to us, chat?

3462
04:22:23,658 --> 04:22:27,016
TALIESIN: Why you make us kill a baby? That was
great.

3463
04:22:27,016 --> 04:22:29,176
LAURA: That was a really cool villain.

3464
04:22:29,232 --> 04:22:31,393
MATT: That was a tiny celestial.

3465
04:22:31,393 --> 04:22:33,209
LIAM: Like beating up a Kewpie doll.

3466
04:22:33,209 --> 04:22:39,478
MATT: Was the prospect of doing something that
attacks via the terrain instead of--

3467
04:22:39,478 --> 04:22:41,125
ASHLEY: Was he an evil baby?

3468
04:22:41,125 --> 04:22:43,555
LAURA: Yeah, was it evil? Or could we have saved
it?

3469
04:22:43,555 --> 04:22:52,663
MATT: The actual title for it is Symphior the
Withered Planetar. It was essentially a celestial

3470
04:22:52,663 --> 04:22:57,011
seed that was placed to eventually emerge as a
guardian in a future time, almost a Ragnarok-type

3471
04:22:57,011 --> 04:23:04,304
circumstance. But the land around it became
corrupted as it gestated or was held in stasis,

3472
04:23:04,304 --> 04:23:10,549
and then was awoken prematurely. And as such,
became this horrible monstrous version of what it

3473
04:23:10,549 --> 04:23:25,504
was supposed to be. It was neutral, but it was
dangerous. It seemed pretty far gone. Thank you

3474
04:23:25,504 --> 04:23:29,842
guys so much. We'll be back next week with the
battle royale. That'll be fun.

3475
04:23:29,842 --> 04:23:31,276
TRAVIS: Everybody kill Keyleth.

3476
04:23:31,276 --> 04:23:34,434
LAURA: Yeah. Go for Keyleth to begin with. Try to
kill her.

3477
04:23:34,434 --> 04:23:37,477
MARISHA: I am going to be looking at <i>all</i> of my
spells.

3478
04:23:37,477 --> 04:23:39,791
TALIESIN: These two have to be the first to go
down.

3479
04:23:39,791 --> 04:23:42,356
MARISHA: What? Why?

3480
04:23:42,356 --> 04:23:44,182
TALIESIN: Because loot drop.

3481
04:23:44,182 --> 04:23:53,051
TRAVIS: Yeah, we've got to get Hunger Games with
this shit. Defend the cornucopia of loot!

3482
04:23:53,100 --> 04:23:55,540
MARISHA: I'm going for the machete!

3483
04:23:55,540 --> 04:23:57,888
SAM: But Vex, you're my best friend!
