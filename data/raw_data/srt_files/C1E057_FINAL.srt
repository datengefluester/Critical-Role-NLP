1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,990
MATT: Welcome to tonight's episode 
of Critical Role,

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:04,000
where a bunch of us 
nerdy-ass voice actors

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
battle traffic from E3 
to get here

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,490
in time to roll dice 
and play Dungeons and Dragons.

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,000
TRAVIS: Yeah, we do.
SAM: Video games!

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,790
MARISHA: All the video games.

7
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,650
MATT: Thank you for being patient 
and waiting for us

8
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,000
with a couple of tech issues

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and generally battling
living in Los Angeles and having a car.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,990
Anyway, before we kick the night off, 
real fast,

11
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,000
I just want to take a moment 
to acknowledge--

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,500
and I feel 
it's important to acknowledge

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,700
there's been a lot of difficulty

14
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,510
and a lot of terrible things 
happening in the world

15
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,000
and in our country in particular 
this past week or so.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,930
And us as Critical Role 
and this community around,

17
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,210
I'm sure many of you agree,

18
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,000
we just wanted 
to take a moment to express

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
that we stand with the families

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,370
of those that are currently dealing 
with this difficulty,

21
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,790
who have lost those,

22
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,000
and stand with the community
that this was aimed at.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,960
And everybody who has come together 
as part of this,

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,000
we are in full support of this whole 
wonderful gathering of people

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
in light of this darkness,

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and I think it's 
not just myself when I say

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,170
that everything 
this community stands for

28
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,000
is to perpetually spread love,

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
community, positivity, 
acceptance,

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and everything in between.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,580
So we just wanted 
to bring that to you guys

32
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,000
and let you know that we're thinking 
about you all out there.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And we have a wonderful community
of Critters out there as well.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,650
If anyone needs any help,
assistance, or guidance,

35
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,030
or even just a happy word
to pick them up during this rough time,

36
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,450
we're all there for you.

37
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,940
So, anyway. 
(blows kiss, sighs)

38
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:47,680
Then, to kick off this evening
of announcements and such,

39
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,370
we are kicking into the second day

40
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:55,230
of our renewed 
Loot Crate sponsorship.

41
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,920
(cheering)

42
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,710
MATT: We wanted to reinforce
that their current theme is Dystopia,

43
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,520
which is an awesome theme box
that deals with all sorts of things

44
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,900
of post-apocalypse and dystopian-type
films, games, the whole thing.

45
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,160
They have Fallout, 
RoboCop, BioShock,

46
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,450
a whole bunch 
of really, really cool things,

47
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,000
so if you guys want to go 
to lootcrate.com/criticalrole,

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,680
We also have the Dystopia DX,
which is their big collector's box--

51
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,540
TRAVIS: So awesome.

52
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,000
MATT: which we showed last week.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
LAURA: Oh, is that 
what this one was from?

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
MARISHA: Yeah, your sweet shirt.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,590
ASHLEY: I love that shirt.
LAURA: Yeah, Skeletor!

56
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,000

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If you guys have a chance 
to check it out,

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
go see if it's 
something you'd be interested in,

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and make sure you put in

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
to go ahead and get 
your subscription discount,

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
which is fantastic.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
TRAVIS: Yeah.

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,670
MATT: We're happy to present that
(funny accent) and are happy

65
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,580
that they like our show enough 
to come and sponsor,

66
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,000
which is awesome.

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,320
(normal voice) So check that out.

68
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,010
You have until 
the 19th at 9pm Pacific

69
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,000
to subscribe 
and receive the Dystopia theme,

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
otherwise it switches over 
to the next theme,

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
so if you're gonna get 
under the wire for that one,

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
(funny accent) do it soon.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's like a-- yeah! We have a--

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
TRAVIS: Weâ€™re giving out crates
in a chat room thing, don't we?

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
MATT: You think so?

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,680
TRAVIS: Yeah.
SAM: Giving out crates?

77
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,000
LAURA: We are?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

78

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,350
LAURA: (gasps) That's exciting!

80
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,070
ASHLEY: It's going to be one at the break?
It's going to be a giveaway at the break?

81
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,960
MATT: Oh, snap.

82
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,260
ASHLEY: I'm just going 
to start making stuff up.

83
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,000
TRAVIS: Is that-- 
did you just point and--

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
ASHLEY: Point, shoot.

85
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,680
SAM: Loot Crate has donated
two Loot Crate DX boxes

86
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,680
to give away to you.

87
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,000
We will be doing this at the break

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,360
and at the end of the night, 
random in chat.

89
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,500
You must be active!

90
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,050
Stay tuned for that! 
Exclamation point!

91
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,000
MARISHA: I'm so glad 
someone wrote that down for us!

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,570
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm so glad

93
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,000
they wrote out 
the exclamation point.

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
TRAVIS: I'm in the chat right now.

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
LAURA: (laughing) Yeah.
TRAVIS: Totally.

96
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
SAM: Remind you, gotta stay active.

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
MARISHA: You're active? Stay active.

98
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
MATT: Stay active, Travis.

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
In the game! (snaps fingers) 
Eyes up here, Grog.

100
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
(laughter)

101
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
MATT: All right, 
so the next couple of things

102
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
we want to mention 
to you guys real fast:

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We have, it started up today,

104
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,490
a Critical Role t-shirt contest 
that went up.

105
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,000
LAURA: Yeah!

106
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
MATT: We're doing this with Woobox.

107
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,760
The link should be in the chat room
for you guys to check out,

108
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,500
but we have currently,

109
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,000
until June 24th at midnight, 
the cut-off date,

110
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
but if anyone wants 
to submit any designs,

111
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
all the rules for the contest 
are there.

112
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
When all those designs 
have been submitted,

113
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,790
we ourselves, 
the cast of Critical Role,

114
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,000
are going to pore through 
and pick our favorite.

115
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,570
LAURA: Top three.

116
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,000
MATT: Top three?
LAURA: Yes.

117
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
TRAVIS: Top three faves.

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,700
MATT: (funny accent) And we will have 
designs incoming forward

119
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,700
for official Critical Role 
shirt stuffs, which is nice.

120
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,670
TRAVIS: (similar accent) Critter.

121
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,000
LAURA: (similar accent) Critter, 
it's a Critter shirt.

122
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
MARISHA: Critter shirt.

123
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,500
TRAVIS: (similar accent) Critter 
community t-shirt.

124
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,000
SAM: Are they all going to be like
Boaty McBoatface or something?

125
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
(laughter)

126
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
LAURA: What's Boaty McBoatface?

127
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
SAM: Boaty McBoatface is 
like an online "name our boat."

128
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,610
(all say Boaty McBoatface)

129
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,510
MATT: Say Boaty McBoatface 
so we can get into this,

130
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,800
and I'll be happy.

131
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,000
(laughter)

132
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
TRAVIS: Do your worst.
Show us your best. Yes!

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,750
MARISHA: All right, 
who did we send to Alaska?

134
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,050
Who was that? Was that Flo Rida?

135
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:10,000
MATT: No. Oh, Alaska? That was...
Redman. Bulldog.

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
MARISHA: Bulldog!

137
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
TALIESIN: Pitbull.
MARISHA: Pitbull! Pitbull!

138
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,890
MATT: I mess up his name 
intentionally all the time.

139
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,000
TRAVIS: Bullman?
TALIESIN: (groans)

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,300
MARISHA: (laughing) Pitbull.
ASHLEY: Bulldog. Shih tzu.

141
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,660
MARISHA: He played in, 
like, a Wal-Mart in Anchorage.

142
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,400
LAURA: But it was like 
a joke for publicity, right?

143
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,000
MATT: He went ahead and did it!

144
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,350
The online poll 
for his next performance,

145
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,050
the internet trolled him and made it
to this far Alaska performance.

146
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,820
MARISHA: A Wal-Mart in Anchorage,
or something like that.

147
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,790
LAURA: And he did it

148
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,900
MATT: And he did it! I was like,
"respect to you, man. Well done."

149
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,760
MARISHA: Yeah, respect.
Like 50 people showed up.

150
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,000
LAURA: That's awesome!
MARISHA: And got a private--

151
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
LAURA: Concert.
MARISHA: Yeah.

152
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
TALIESIN: You know what,
I've done a con in Anchorage.

153
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,620
It's nice. I like it.

154
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,820
TRAVIS: Yeah, man. Anchorage moose.
TALIESIN: They've got moose.

155
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,740
LAURA: Can we talk about our next thing
because I'm so excited about it.

156
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,800
SAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: What's the next thing?

157
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,000
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Do we get to show it, or no?

158
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
LAURA: YES.
TALIESIN: Oh, yes, that!

159
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
LIAM: (frustrated noises)

160
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,480
LAURA: Wait, okay, 
so Liam gets to say it.

161
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,000
MATT: So, you are technically DM.

162
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
LIAM: So some of you 
might remember us

163
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
talking about Joe Madureira

164
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,030
and his Kickstarter game, 
Darksiders Night War,

165
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,000
which he successfully Kickstarted.

166
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,360
We talked about it a bunch 
on this show--

167
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,000
MATT: Battle War, you mean?
LIAM: Hm?

168
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
MATT: Darksiders was--

169
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
LIAM: Excuse me. Battle Chasers.
LAURA: Battle Chasers.

170
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
LIAM: Excuse me, 
I was going to be here

171
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,500
for a half hour and settle down

172
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,000
and go over my talking points.

173
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
LIAM: Battle Chasers.
SAM: You're wearing the shirt.

174
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
LIAM: Battle Chasers. 
I'm wearing the damn shirt.

175
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
(laughter)

176
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
LIAM: Sorry. 
Hour and a half in L.A. traffic.

177
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Anyway.

178
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,710
He successfully Kickstarted,
they're working on it,

179
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,000
I just saw him at E3,
I saw him a couple of days ago.

180
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,500
If you don't know Joe's work,

181
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,850
he is a comic book artist rock star.

182
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,270
He has worked on X-men,

183
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,000
he's worked on Avenging Spider-Man,

184
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Inhumans, Ultimates 3,

185
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and his own comic, Battle Chasers,

186
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
which I fell in love with 
when I was a teenager.

187
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,500
He does gorgeous artwork.

188
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,000
He's only gotten better with time.

189
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
SAM: Pitbull Chasers.
MARISHA: (laughs)

190
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
LIAM: Pitbull Chasers, Flo Rida,
and Joe collaborating together.

191
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Anyway, that game's coming out.

192
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You should check it out, 
this is it.

193
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But I bring that up because
while Joe is a busy, busy guy,

194
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
he somehow found the time-- 
I'm so excited--

195
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
to create an exclusive art piece 
for Critical Role.

196
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
ASHLEY: Can we bring it in?

197
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
MARISHA: So gorgeous.
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

198
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
(noises of awe)

199
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,500
LIAM: Look at that business. 
So right now--

200
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,050
LAURA: It's blocking my face, 
but I want to see it.

201
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,000
MARISHA: Well, we've seen it tiny.

202
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
LIAM: Guys, if you go over 
to the Geek and Sundry shop

203
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
right now,
this is on pre-order, so--

204
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,500
I'm going over my script--

205
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,000
signed versions of this

206
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,630
will be available for pre-order 
for 2 weeks only.

207
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,740
TRAVIS: Yeah, limited 2-week run, y'all.
Get it.

208
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,970
LIAM: 2-week pre-order.
And then unsigned for 3 weeks.

209
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,000
LAURA: 3 weeks.

210
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,050
LIAM: So this is now or never.
ASHLEY: It's so badass!

211
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,000
MARISHA: Now or never
and then it goes away forever.

212
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
LAURA: Forever!

213
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
LIAM: And it's too gorgeous, too. 
Oh my lord.

214
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
MARISHA: It's so gorgeous.

215
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
ASHLEY: I wonder if we should show
a close-up or something.

216
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,590
LAURA: So yeah, keep in mind
when you order it on pre-order

217
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,000
that you have to wait
for it to be fully pre-ordered

218
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,466
before we can send it out.

219
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:57,050
I don't know if that was on camera
because I'm above the poster.

220
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,500
(laughter)

221
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,000
ASHLEY: It's so sexy.
MARISHA: You're so sexy.

222
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,500
LIAM: It's all right. 
Vex is on the paper, so.

223
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,000
LAURA: That's right.

224
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
MARISHA: Pike in that 
three-point landing!

225
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,500
LAURA: Oh no, don't take it away.

226
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,000
ASHLEY: (singing) Goodbye, my love!

227
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
TRAVIS: There's an image 
on the website, right?

228
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,500
MARISHA: And they are 
movie-poster size.

229
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,000
They are that size.

230
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,230
LAURA: Yeah, they're that full-on--

231
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,500
LIAM: They're 24 x 36. Gorgeous.
MARISHA: 24 x 36.

232
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,000
SAM: And there's a place to click

233
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,500
on the page where you are
right now watching this.

234
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,180
MATT: Those are my eyes. 
I'm on a poster!

235
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,780
MARISHA: If you scroll down, 
there'll be a button.

236
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,000
LIAM: Scroll down 
to the bottom of the page,

237
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
there's a button for that.

238
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
MARISHA: Scroll down, 
there's a button.

239
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
LIAM: Thank you, Joe. 
Thank you. It's gorgeous.

240
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,500
LAURA AND MARISHA: Thank you, Joe!
MATT: Thank you, Joe. It's amazing.

241
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
ASHLEY: Thanks, Joe!
TALIESIN: That's amazing.

242
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,000
LAURA: It's beautiful.
ASHLEY: I love it so much.

243
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,840
MATT: It is getting framed
and becoming a centerpiece of our home.

244
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,000
LIAM: And Battle Chasers Night War.

245
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You should check it out today.

246
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
(laughter)

247
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
MATT: All righty.

248
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,550
SAM: Signed, by the way, 
signed by us, not by the artist.

249
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,000
LIAM: Us. By us.
MARISHA: Yeah, by us.

250
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,790
TALIESIN: You could find him.
Hunt him down if you wanted to.

251
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,800
MARISHA: Yes. (laughs)

252
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,000
MATT: (in a funny accent) 
Taliesin, you are going to be

253
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,430
somewhere this weekend, 
are you not?

254
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,010
TALIESIN: Oh, god, I am.
As soon as we're done here,

255
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,000
I go home and pack 
and get on an airplane.

256
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I will be at Amazing Comic Con
in Vegas all weekend.

257
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
TRAVIS: You bastard.

258
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,500
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
Sleep is never gonna happen.

259
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,000
LAURA, ASHLEY, AND MARISHA: No.
TALIESIN: Never.

260
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
ASHLEY: What is that.
TRAVIS: Sleep.

261
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
TALIESIN: You can meet me, 
slightly deranged,

262
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
all weekend at Amazing Comic Con

263
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,500
with a bunch of other 
Street Fighter kids,

264
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,000
and it's going to be a great time,

265
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,500
and be right next to the Library Bards.

266
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,000
Bonnie Gordon, yeah yeah.

267
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
MATT: Yes, yes.
TALIESIN: Yeah, be hanging with them.

268
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, Library Bards. Nice.

269
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
MATT: Glorious.
TALIESIN: Good times.

270
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,500
MATT: And if I recall,

271
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,000
there was also 
a recent announcement

272
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
of a cool Telltale game 
that went up this week.

273
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,060
LAURA: Oh, man! 
Batman the Telltale series!

274
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,000
TRAVIS: It's sweet.
They announced the Batman cast

275
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and Laura is playing 
Catwoman Selina Kyle.

276
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah, man.

277
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
TRAVIS: I play District Attorney

278
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,880
LAURA AND TRAVIS: Harvey Dent.

279
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,320
ASHLEY: Ohhh.
LAURA: It's pretty exciting.

280
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,000
TRAVIS: We're gonna 
turn Gotham around.

281
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
LAURA: And at E3 today,
we went and checked out the demo

282
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
and it's pretty frickin' cool.

283
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
ASHLEY: It's so good.

284
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I saw it yesterday and today

285
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
because I just couldn't not 
watch it again.

286
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
TRAVIS: It's gonna be fun.

287
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
MATT: All righty,

288
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
anyone else have anything
they want to talk about?

289
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
(southern drawl) Or shall we dive into

290
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
the rest of tonight's story?

291
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
TRAVIS: Let's dive into the story.
MARISHA: Let's dive.

292
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
MATT: (southern drawl) All righty.

293
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Let's go ahead and bring it down

294
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
as we all prepare ourselves 
to begin to kick off

295
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

296
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
(spooky ethereal music)

297
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
(heavy breathing)

298
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
(roaring)

299
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:42,000
(dramatic music)

300
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
(gun firing)

301
00:10:47,000 --> 00:11:41,000
(dramatic music)

302
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
(crackling flames)

303
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
MATT: Welcome back.

304
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,050
So, picking up 
where we last left off last week.

305
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,050
Vox Machina,
the growing troop of heroic misfits,

306
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,950
having recently felled

307
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,000
their first recent member
of the Chroma Conclave,

308
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Umbrasyl the Hope Devourer,

309
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
as well as destroying

310
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
the current incursion
of the Herd of Storms

311
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
in the city of Westruun.

312
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You met with 
the remaining people of the town

313
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,170
and began to decide a plan 
for its continued existence

314
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,990
and the recovery of those
that were displaced

315
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,000
in these recent conflicts.

316
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Part of this process was meeting
an individual named Kerrek,

317
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,030
who was a blacksmith
who had been in the town for a while,

318
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,000
who unwittingly 
became part of this discussion--

319
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,270
MARISHA: My best friend.

320
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,000
MATT: (laughs)

321
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,020
Grog had spoken with 
the remnants of the Herd of Storms

322
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,000
that had essentially 
been disbanding from the name

323
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,160
and moving west 
to join with the Rivermaw,

324
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,000
which had stepped off 
from the herd not too long ago.

325
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You guys had a hot springs episode 
in the mansion.

326
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
SAM: (laughs)

327
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,690
MATT: Scanlan, 
you had made your way back to Kymal,

328
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,980
in which you, along with the aid 
of a few of your friends,

329
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,710
figured out a plan in which the people 
who had been displaced

330
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,000
could eventually return to Westruun,

331
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,530
and also found Kaylie 
and spoke with her,

332
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:15,100
had your somewhat-tearful 
reunion there.

333
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,910
You guys began to construct
a subterranean portion of Westruun

334
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,000
that would be protected
from future dragon incursion,

335
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,100
renovating and restructuring

336
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,240
within the sewer system 
beneath the city.

337
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,710
After this process was complete,

338
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,000
you decided the next level 
of your trek,

339
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
the next direction you would travel

340
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,030
would be towards the far western,
northwestern continent of Othanzia.

341
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,020
Specifically, the city of Vasselheim
that you all know so well.

342
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,880
All of you guys stepping through
a tree portal presented by Keyleth,

343
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,720
you immediately step out 
into the snowy exterior

344
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,310
of what seems like the outside
of the Quad Roads in Vasselheim.

345
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:58,000
And now, we see what 
your next plan of action is.

346
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,090
What do you guys want to do?

347
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,000
SAM: (sighs) Light a fire.

348
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
LAURA: What time is it? (laughs)

349
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
MARISHA: Yeah, what time is it?

350
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,580
MATT: It's hard to tell right now
with the cloud cover so thick in the sky,

351
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,580
but you envision at this point in time,

352
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,550
it's probably mid-afternoon or so.

353
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,350
The general omniscient glow 
through the clouds,

354
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,670
kind of diffused light,

355
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,010
but based on the time that you--

356
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:25,000
where you were 
and how far you traveled,

357
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,230
you gather it's probably 
early to mid-afternoon.

358
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
SAM: Well, you're the one 
who brought us here, Vax.

359
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,030
Where would you like to go?

360
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:37,630
LIAM: I need to go 
to the temple of the Raven Queen.

361
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,000
SAM: We'll come with you.
LAURA: Let's go.

362
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
TALIESIN: I know where that is.

363
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,500
LIAM: I know that you all 
have a lot of errands to do.

364
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,500
I don't need everyone to come.

365
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,000
TRAVIS: We have a lot of errands to do?

366
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
LIAM: I thought so. You mentioned...

367
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
LAURA: My only errand 
is to keep my eyes on you.

368
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,670
TALIESIN: I have some errands,
if that makes anybody feel better.

369
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,000
I have some errands to run.

370
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,020
TRAVIS: Do you need any help
with your errands?

371
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,200
TALIESIN: Sure. Actually, yes.
I would love some help with my errands.

372
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,000
LAURA: Don't let him shop, Percy.
Do not let him shop.

373
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,260
TALIESIN: That shouldn't be a problem.

374
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,030
TRAVIS: I don't know what that means,
but I'm sure I take great offense.

375
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,000
LAURA: (laughs)

376
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
TALIESIN: You're getting smarter.

377
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,550
TRAVIS: How effin' dare you.

378
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,760
LAURA: That eagle form 
really made a difference.

379
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,760
TRAVIS: I spit out a feather. 
(pthh)

380
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
MATT: So. Who's off to where?

381
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,070
LAURA: Where is this 
Raven Queen's temple?

382
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,750
LIAM: (sighs) 
We've not been here many times.

383
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,170
Are we surrounded by people?

384
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,560
Are there people walking about?

385
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,930
MATT: It is quite a busy time 
in the afternoon.

386
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,610
There is actually a bit 
of hustle and bustle.

387
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,080
Looking around,

388
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,000
just a quick glance 
at your vicinity in Vasselheim,

389
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
you can see a lot of the bastions 
are out in force.

390
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,590
Many of them are in process 
of helping construct

391
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,960
what looks like 
reinforced dragon-headed ballistae.

392
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,040
Some of the ones you had seen
towards the outside walls of the city.

393
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,000
There are more being installed
upon the inner walls,

394
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and the ones in the distance

395
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
appear to be
under some form of construction.

396
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,350
TALIESIN: We have rooms.

397
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,000
Why don't we go claim our rooms

398
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
and I'm sure they can lead us
to everywhere we need to go.

399
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
LIAM: That makes sense.

400
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,500
MARISHA: Want to go check in
at the Slayer's Take?

401
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,000
TALIESIN: And we can meet back there
when everything is done.

402
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
MARISHA: All right.

403
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
LAURA: Do you need 
to check in at your temple,

404
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,500
or should we pretend 
you're not here

405
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,320
so they don't try 
to make you stay?

406
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,000
ASHLEY: Let's just pretend 
for a little bit.

407
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: Okay.

408
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,530
ASHLEY: And then I'll check in later.

409
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:25,000
There's no rush to get there.

410
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,750
At least, that I know of right now.

411
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,000
SAM: God will wait 
for a long time.

412
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
TRAVIS: All right. 
To the Slayer's Take, then?

413
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
LAURA: Let's do it.

414
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
TALIESIN: To the Slayer's Take.

415
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,040
MATT: All right. You guys continue 
further south into the Quad Roads

416
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,010
until eventually you find yourselves
at the Slayer's Take guildhall.

417
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,280
The door is partially ajar already.

418
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,000
It appears that somebody 
had left it open,

419
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
but it is warm on the inside.

420
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,500
You can see a fireplace hearth

421
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,000
on the far back and to the right

422
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
is already kind of filling the area

423
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
with this subtle musty smoke smell,

424
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
and the crackling of wood 
in the distance

425
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
is a very welcoming sensation

426
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
from the cold exterior 
of the city streets.

427
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
As you enter,

428
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,550
you do not see anybody
at the front desk at the moment,

429
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,732
but you do see a few other
random individuals of the guild

430
00:17:07,732 --> 00:17:09,175
that have taken certain tables.

431
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:10,566
Some are eating, 
and some are in the process

432
00:17:10,566 --> 00:17:12,740
of playing cards or passing the time.

433
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,990
It seems to be 
a relatively casual day

434
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,990
here at the Slayer's Take.

435
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:21,900
But your rooms are still available,
best as you need.

436
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,460
Anything you specifically require 
in this place?

437
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,400
LAURA: Can I grab one of the people 
that are here and ask him,

438
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,000
What's all 
the hustle about outside?

439
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I see them installing more.

440
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,540
MATT: Okay. You go ahead and--

441
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,000
one of the guys closest to you,

442
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
you've met him briefly in passing,
his name is Loran.

443
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
He has a completely bald head

444
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
with a single stripe tattoo 
down the center.

445
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
He has a very, very pointed long chin.

446
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Human, but he's probably
been busted in the face a few times.

447
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You can see there's just scars

448
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
and what appears to be bone structure

449
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
that may have been reformed at times
due to blunt trauma.

450
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
But he's just sitting there,
sharpening his weapons,

451
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,020
just kind of doing good upon his own self,
being prepared for anything.

452
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,500
But as you come over 
to ask him the question,

453
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,000
he looks up to you and goes,

454
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
"Word's gone 
around the town recently

455
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
"that there's some wandering 
dragon horde

456
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
"tearing through Tal'Dorei,

457
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
"so they're just upping security 
around these places, just in case."

458
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
LAURA: Smart.

459
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,330
MATT: "I hope so. 
Hope they make their way here."

460
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:29,000
LAURA: Nobody's sighted the dragons, 
though, over here?

461
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
MATT: "Not to my knowledge, but

462
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
"(chuckles) I'd love to get my hand 
on some of them scales."

463
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
(blade scrapes)

464
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
MARISHA: What's your name?

465
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,160
MATT: "Loran."

466
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,500
MARISHA and SAM: What?

467
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:47,000
MARISHA: Oran? What?

468
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,050
MATT: "Loran."

469
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,000
MARISHA: Loran.

470
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
MATT: Because... that's what I remember.

471
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,680
LIAM: Thought so.

472
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,200
(laughter)

473
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,000
LIAM: It took over 50 episodes 
for that to happen.

474
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,000
LAURA: I'm sorry, 
what was the question?

475
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,500
MATT: Well, when you don't take notes

476
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,980
when I give you 
a character's name originally,

477
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,860
and they come back around 
and it's weird

478
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,970
when you suddenly take damage
and your character starts hemorrhaging.

479
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,580
LAURA: Oh no. Loran.
Loran was his name.

480
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,670
LIAM: I was just eating an apple.
Why am I dying?

481
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,980
MATT: (laughs)

482
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,340
TRAVIS: Veiled threat.

483
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,150
ASHLEY: I'm just sitting by the fire, so.

484
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,520
LAURA: Slayer's Take.

485
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,700
MARISHA: So we have seen 
this guy before?

486
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,000
MATT: Some of you 
may have seen him in passing.

487
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,890
You haven't really 
had a conversation with him.

488
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,000
He just exists within the guild.

489
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
There's many members
that you've come across in the past.

490
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,500
MARISHA: Sure, that exist.
TRAVIS: Probably a dragon.

491
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,000
LAURA: Pointy chin. Got it.

492
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
ASHLEY: Stripe on his head.

493
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
TRAVIS: Nothing wrong with those.

494
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,440
LIAM: How are the people doing?

495
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,730
Is there a sense of worry,
or do you guys feel pretty secure?

496
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,000
MATT: "As far as this town is concerned,

497
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
"it takes a lot more than a couple dragons
to drop these walls.

498
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,900
"It's the reason it's been around 
for a long time,

499
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,690
"and I'd like to see them try."

500
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:03,000
MARISHA: Have you ever
encountered a dragon personally, Loran?

501
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
MATT: "I mean, I've come across
a few small ilk in my days."

502
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Sure. Yeah. Yep.

503
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
SAM: (laughs) Are you hazing Loran?

504
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,910
MARISHA: Nope.

505
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:15,500
LAURA: Keyleth is proud of herself

506
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,000
because we've just killed our third,
actually.

507
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
MATT: "Oh, that's fantastic. 
I love to hear it.

508
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
"You half-elves are a humble bunch."

509
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,430
(laughter)

510
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:30,120
TRAVIS: Fire! Put the flames out!

511
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,000
MARISHA: Yeah, Team Half-Elf. Yeah!

512
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
TRAVIS: Such a good burn.

513
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
LAURA: Liam, I don't want 
to ask Matt this,

514
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,050
but the chick 
that runs the Slayer's Take,

515
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,000
her name's Vanessa?

516
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
ALL: Vanessa.

517
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
SAM: Cyndrian.

518
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
LIAM: And her husband Merkin.

519
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
SAM: Mertin.

520
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
MATT: (laughs)

521
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
LAURA: Are Vanessa 
and Merkin around?

522
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
SAM: Mertin.

523
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
LAURA: Mertin.

524
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,760
SAM: Merkin is a different thing.

525
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,480
MATT: (laughs) Yeah, 
a very different thing.

526
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,168
I guess it depends on 
if he shaved recently.

527
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,820
He looks toward the back room,
where her main office is, and he goes,

528
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,860
"You're welcome to go ahead
and knock on the door

529
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,570
"if you're feeling frisky."

530
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:09,530
LAURA: Should we try to sell Vanessa
some of our dragon bits?

531
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,000
TRAVIS: We should sell to a merchant?

532
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,620
LAURA: Well, they tend to be in the--

533
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,000
TALIESIN: They may have a buyer.

534
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

535
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,500
TRAVIS: Love that you 
asked me that question.

536
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,000
LAURA: I know, right?
What was I thinking?

537
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
TRAVIS: I don't know. (laughs)

538
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,500
TALIESIN: Keep a few of the scales, obviously.

539
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,000
TRAVIS: We can tell 
what my place in the party is.

540
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,500
LAURA: Of course. Grog, come with me.

541
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,000
MARISHA: Oh, wait, keep the teeth.
Keep enough teeth for us.

542
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
TALIESIN: We'll talk 
about the cold bag for now

543
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
and see if there's anything else
they want to talk about.

544
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
MARISHA: I have an idea for teeth.

545
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
LAURA: Can I go find Vanessa?

546
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
MATT: You go 
and knock on the door. (knocks)

547
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
There's a brief pause. 
Knock again. (knocks)

548
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,400
LAURA: (sing-song) Vanessa?
Vox Machina here-- oh, hi.

549
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,000
MATT: The door (whoosh) swings open.
You have to duck backwards.

550
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It (thump) slams onto
the other side of the wall there,

551
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
knocking a few knick-knacks
that were on a nearby shelf over.

552
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And Vanessa swings out.

553
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
"What? Who's calling-- ah.
It has been some time.

554
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
"How nice of you to come and visit.

555
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
"May I... be of service to you?"

556
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
LAURA: Oh, well, we were wondering
if we could be of service to you.

557
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,410
We happen to have acquired
a great many dragon bits

558
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,000
and we thought you might be in need of

559
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
buying them for your sellers-- buyers.

560
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Your people.

561
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
SAM: Fencing them.

562
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
LAURA: Fence-- you know.

563
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
TALIESIN: I really thought 
you'd be better at this.

564
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
MATT: "There is no fencing."

565
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,610
LAURA: No fencing, no. No, you're--

566
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,000
MATT: "We run a legitimate business."

567
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
LAURA: Legal buyers.

568
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
MATT: "Good. 
As was I hoping to hear this.

569
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,730
"Let me check my ledger."

570
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,000
She turns around 
and goes back to her desk.

571
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,040
Her tail flicks behind her as she steps 
over to her table, leans over.

572
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,000
"(muttering) Ah!"

573
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,290
Pulls one of the books. (blows)
Starts thumbing through it.

574
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:45,000
(mutters) "What color dragon?"

575
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
LAURA: Black.

576
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
MATT: "Chromatic."

577
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,290
SAM: (quietly) Ancient.

578
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,740
LAURA: Ancient black dragon.

579
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:58,000
MARISHA: Yeah, you might have heard 
about him. Umbrasyl... (chuckles)

580
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:04,000
SAM: You're super salty today.

581
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,710
TRAVIS: Tone it down two notches.

582
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,936
MATT: "There is currently
no contract for a black dragon.

583
00:23:10,936 --> 00:23:17,064
"I do have one up for a bronze 
or perhaps a white, but..."

584
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:19,460
LAURA: Oh, white! 
Do we have any white bits left?

585
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,750
TRAVIS: Yeah.

586
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,000
ASHLEY: We should have white 
from back in the day.

587
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
LAURA: What, do you want scales or...

588
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
MATT: "Specifically hide.
If there is white dragonhide?"

589
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
TRAVIS: We have 60 pounds of--

590
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
LAURA: That was the dragon
we killed for you before,

591
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,190
because we didn't bring the--

592
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,500
TALIESIN: No, it was before that one.

593
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,240
LAURA: No, but we killed one with Zahra.
We killed a white dragon.

594
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,110
MATT: "That was 
for a different contract.

595
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,000
"This is for a newer one I came by."

596
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
LAURA: We've killed four dragons?!
Four fucking dragons. Go us.

597
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,460
MARISHA: Yes, we have. Yes.

598
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,720
TRAVIS: Excuse us 
while we reminisce, apparently.

599
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,770
MATT: "(deadpan) Yes, it is amazing.

600
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:53,730
"The things you've accomplished.
I am blown away.

601
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:57,080
"But in light of your capabilities,

602
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,000
"I do not require anything black dragon.

603
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
"However, if a contract comes in,
I know who to call.

604
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,760
"Hold onto that,
because that would save you a trip."

605
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,960
LAURA and MARISHA: All right.

606
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,110
TALIESIN: We do have
some white scales left over, don't we?

607
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,090
LAURA: Yes, I think so.

608
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,610
TRAVIS: Yeah, we do.
We have 60 pounds of scales.

609
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,000
MATT: "Is this hide or scales?"

610
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
TRAVIS: Just scales. 
No hide, unfortunately.

611
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,010
MATT: "Well, I could definitely do

612
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,000
"a bit of business for you there.

613
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,420
"The hide would fetch more, but--
60 pounds, you said?"

614
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,000
TRAVIS: Yeah. 64, to be exact.

615
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,020
LAURA: Of white dragon scales.
MATT: "64 of white dragon scales, okay."

616
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:32,230
MATT: "I would be willing to continue
at least part of this contract

617
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:39,000
"for this applicant for...
let's say... 4,500 gold pieces."

618
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
LAURA: 5,000 gold pieces, 
I think is a fair price.

619
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
MATT: "This is not about bartering.

620
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
"This is what the contract says, my dear.

621
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
"This is beyond 
a situation of conversation.

622
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
"The paperwork is already signed."

623
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,230
LAURA: What if we gave you 
less dragon scales?

624
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:59,970
Would you have said less money?

625
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,000
SAM: That's typically how it works.

626
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,400
TALIESIN and MARISHA: (laugh)

627
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,530
MATT: "Vex'ahlia. My dear.

628
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:18,000
"My delightful little 
dragon-hating half-elf.

629
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
"We've been good to you.

630
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,070
"We've done many great things for you.
You've done great things for us.

631
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,380
"This is a fantastic arrangement."

632
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,000
(thud) She slams the book shut 
and sets it down.

633
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,490
"But you have signed on with us,

634
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:32,000
"and the deal is to fulfill contracts

635
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,500
"as they are signed, as they are written,

636
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,000
"as they are agreed upon by the person.

637
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,500
"If you wish not to accept this contract,

638
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,910
"we can just wait 
until somebody else picks it up

639
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,490
"and goes out and fulfills this need

640
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:42,000
"at the price 
at which they are requesting for this.

641
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
"You're welcome to keep the scales."

642
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
LAURA: I think we'll keep them

643
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
and we'll sell them to other vendors, then.

644
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,940
SAM: Haven't we had them for years?

645
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,760
TALIESIN: I have a thing 
I'm thinking about.

646
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,710
MATT: "See? Then it's easy 
for you to get rid of them.

647
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:55,440
"If they've been a problem for you,
then I'm sure this would be easy."

648
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,520
SAM: Where are we going to sell these?
The world's on fire!

649
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,000
MARISHA: Okay, hang on. 
We know it's here.

650
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,770
There aren't that many
white dragons walking around--

651
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,230
TALIESIN: Certainly not anymore.

652
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,000
MARISHA: Certainly not anymore.
We know it's here.

653
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Why don't we sleep on it. 
Think about it.

654
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
If we're ever in a pinch for money,
we can come back.

655
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
TRAVIS: Yeah. Sounds good.

656
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
LAURA: Vanessa, you're so kind.

657
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,720
TRAVIS: Besides, I've been working
on that dragon immunity potion.

658
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,340
LAURA: I'm so sorry.

659
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,660
MATT: "That is all right. Goodbye."

660
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,770
And she shoos you out.

661
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:27,000
MARISHA: Oh, wait, Vanessa. Wait.

662
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
MATT: "Yes, other female half-elf?"

663
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,420
MARISHA: That's me.
Where's the temple of the Raven Queen?

664
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:37,000
MATT: "Oh, you're looking for 
the Duskmeadow. Raven's Crest."

665
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,330
She points loosely outward,

666
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:43,460
kind of southeast of the direction
of the Slayer's Take guildhall.

667
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,000
"It's kind of hard to miss.
It's giant, black, ominous.

668
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,890
"(chuckles) You'll see it."

669
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:51,000
And she bops your nose
a little bit with her finger.

670
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
"Now, please. Out of my office.
I have work to get done."

671
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,770
LAURA: Thank you, Vanessa.
MARISHA: Okay, bye.

672
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,000
SAM: Thank you. 
Kord's strength to you.

673
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,220
MATT: "That does nothing for me."

674
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,000
(slamming) Slams the door shut.

675
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
LAURA: They were worth a lot more

676
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,500
than what she was offering, 
just for the record.

677
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,500
They are worth so much more.

678
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,000
SAM: To whom? 
We haven't ever sold them

679
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
or come across anyone 
who wanted them before.

680
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
TALIESIN: This is no reason
to get rid of something for wholesale.

681
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,516
LAURA: Well, we've not really tried.

682
00:27:10,516 --> 00:27:12,000
That doesn't mean 
we should just give them away.

683
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,660
SAM: We also are almost full

684
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,520
in our Bag of Holding, 
might I remind you,

685
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,570
and 64 pounds
would free up quite some--

686
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,000
LAURA: It's not 64 pounds.

687
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,350
SAM: It's 64 pounds.
TRAVIS: It's 64.

688
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,560
LAURA: Oh, it was 64 pounds. (groans)
MATT: (laughs)

689
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,000
TRAVIS: Like I just told you.
ASHLEY: 64 pounds of scales.

690
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,500
TRAVIS: But I could 
get rid of some other stuff.

691
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,000
LAURA: Well, they're worth 
like 20,000 gold.

692
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,500
SAM: To whom?

693
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,000
LAURA: You don't care.

694
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
TRAVIS: We also have 15 cases
of expensive-ass bottles of wine.

695
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
TALIESIN: I'm just going 
to point out, since--

696
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
LIAM, LAURA, AND MARISHA: 
We should drink those.

697
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,500
TALIESIN: We should drink those, 
first of all.

698
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,000
That is the only thing that makes sense.

699
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And I feel-- and I apologize
if it seems like I say this a lot,

700
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,850
but I do have a castle
that we can drop things at,

701
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:56,000
and we can leave them there,
perhaps get back to them at a later date.

702
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
MARISHA: To be fair, Percy, 
you do a lot to remind us

703
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
to try not to forget that you're titled.

704
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
SAM: To be fair, have we ever

705
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
gone back for something before, ever,

706
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,500
in our entire travels?

707
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,000
TALIESIN: Yes.
SAM: What?

708
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
LIAM: We needn't stay here long.

709
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I don't think what I'm here for
is going to take too long.

710
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,580
I hope.
We could go to Whitestone next.

711
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,300
TALIESIN: Yes, drop everything off,

712
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:24,000
create a little nest of what we need.

713
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
LAURA: All right. 
Let's go find your queen.

714
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
TRAVIS: (quietly) 
There is some gross shit in this bag.

715
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,650
(laughter)

716
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,000
TALIESIN: You found the troll dick, 
didn't you?

717
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
LAURA: What do you have in there?

718
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
TRAVIS: There are six basilisk eggs.

719
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
LAURA: Are they still good?
MARISHA: Those are probably bad.

720
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
TALIESIN: Oh, I bet those
have gone really bad.

721
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
TRAVIS: I reach into the Bag of Holding
and think about one basilisk egg.

722
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
LIAM: I'm sure they smell like Grog.

723
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
MATT: You pull out a basilisk egg.

724
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
TALIESIN: Do they just turn to stone?

725
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
MATT: It's roughly that size.
It's a dull grayish-blue hint.

726
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
LIAM: Sulfuric?
TRAVIS: Can I get the smell?

727
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,020
MATT: It has a somewhat, very vague 
sulfurous scent on the outside of the egg.

728
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,000
TRAVIS: I'll put it back in the bag.

729
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
ASHLEY: Oh, Vanessa!

730
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
LAURA: We could make stink-bombs with it.

731
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
MARISHA AND TALIESIN: Ooh.
LIAM: Yeah, we could.

732
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,500
MARISHA: Good idea. I like that.

733
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,000
TRAVIS: All right. So what's next?

734
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
LAURA: We go see the Raven Queen.

735
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
You go see the Raven Queen
and we wait outside.

736
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,500
LIAM: I didn't say anything.
LAURA: Uselessly.

737
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,000
LIAM: I didn't say anything!

738
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
TALIESIN: Is it in the direction 
where I have to go?

739
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
MATT: Where are you heading?

740
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,500
TALIESIN: I need to resupply everything.

741
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,000
MATT: That's the opposite direction.
TALIESIN: Okay.

742
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
MATT: You're heading 
to the Braving Grounds.

743
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
They're heading to the Duskmeadow.

744
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
TRAVIS: Oh! I like the sound of that. 
I'll go with you.

745
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
TALIESIN: Yes, you will.

746
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
SAM: I'll come with you, as well.

747
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,220
TRAVIS: Yeah, three! Who else?

748
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,000
Any other takers
while Vax goes and gets a tattoo?

749
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
MATT: (laughs)

750
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,550
LIAM: Another tattoo?

751
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:36,000
TRAVIS: Well, I thought that--
is that not what you're doing?

752
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
LAURA: That's what he's doing, Grog.
LIAM: It is. I'm getting a tattoo.

753
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,500
ASHLEY: Close. Something like that.

754
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,000
LIAM: It will say "Phillip the Brave".

755
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
TRAVIS: (gasps)
LIAM: Across the small of my back.

756
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
TRAVIS: Phillip. Full name, Phillip.

757
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
TALIESIN: This is out of--

758
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I don't know if this is going to be
any help or anything,

759
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
by the way, Vax, but just in case.

760
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I'm going to reach in

761
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
and pull out the mask 
and hand it to Vax.

762
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,230
Just in case.

763
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,816
LIAM: (slowly) I don't know.

764
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,000
Thank you.

765
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,350
MARISHA: Percy?

766
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,680
TALIESIN: Yes?

767
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,000
MARISHA: Do you still have 
that raven's skull I gave you?

768
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
TALIESIN: I do. We'll talk about that.
MARISHA: All right.

769
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,780
TALIESIN: But I've found in moments

770
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,000
when I was feeling less than brave

771
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
that pretending to be
somebody else on occasion,

772
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
even afterwards, can be helpful.

773
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
LIAM: Is there anything left 
inside of this?

774
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,500
TALIESIN: Just some spit.

775
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,750
LIAM: That's wonderful.
LAURA: (laughs)

776
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,000
TALIESIN: And something that smells nice 
in the front that will help.

777
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,590
It helps cleanse the air.

778
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,570
LIAM: All right, Percival.

779
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:49,870
TALIESIN: I don't know why. 
I'm feeling... what would be the word?

780
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,510
Superstitious.

781
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,250
MARISHA: Oh, I was 
going to say "giving."

782
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,380
LAURA: She's ornery today.
MARISHA: Sorry. Angry.

783
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,310
TALIESIN: You know, 
I kind of like it.

784
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:07,000
LIAM: You know. Enough chit-chat.
Let's get this shit done.

785
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
MATT AND TRAVIS: All right.

786
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
MATT: So you three 
are going to the Braving Grounds.

787
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
You four are going to the Duskmeadow.

788
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
LAURA: We are.

789
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
MATT: Okay. All right, so.

790
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,750
You three are making your way
towards the Braving Grounds.

791
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,810
Following suit after Percival,

792
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:25,000
you make your way up
not quite to the Trial Forge,

793
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
which is where you had 
your last discussion

794
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
and brief showdown 
with Earthbreaker Groon.

795
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,160
Still seeing the large statue of Kord

796
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,410
looming over the entirety of the realm.

797
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:40,000
You can still see the large columns
of dark smoke and soot

798
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
coming out of the various forges,
the various mining encampments,

799
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,320
and a lot of the folks there

800
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,000
that are working on different pieces 
of iron and metal.

801
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You, I assume, make your way
to a very familiar abode. (laughs)

802
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
TALIESIN: Of all the options of the world
that you've given me...

803
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
MATT: All right.

804
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
(laughter)

805
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
TALIESIN: This is really your fault 
as much as it's mine.

806
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
MATT: You come up to the outside 
of a familiar hovel.

807
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,100
Previously damaged,
missing part of its roof.

808
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,000
The roof is mostly repaired.

809
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,660
You actually see two individuals 
are over the top of it,

810
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,000
hammering pieces of wood into it.

811
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,720
Not a very fine job, 
but definitely enough patchwork

812
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,530
to keep the rain and snow 
from pouring in.

813
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,500
The door is partially open 
as you approach.

814
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
TALIESIN: (sighs heavily)

815
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
SAM: You might be blown up 
if you go in there.

816
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
TALIESIN: I know.

817
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
TRAVIS: Should we wait outside?

818
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
TALIESIN: Let's just all be ginger.

819
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
(louder) Hello? Victor, are you home?

820
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
It's Percy.

821
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
MATT: Silence.

822
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
SAM: Want me to go in 
and investigate?

823
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
TALIESIN: Hold on. 
(louder) Hello, you up there? Hello?

824
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,590
MATT: (hammering noises)

825
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,000
"What?"

826
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
TALIESIN: Where is the owner 
of this domicile?

827
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
MATT: "I don't know. 
I haven't seen him."

828
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
TALIESIN: How long has he been gone for?

829
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
MATT: "(mutters) 
(louder) Couple of hours."

830
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,740
SAM: Oh, good. Not dead, then.
TRAVIS: He's dead.

831
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:27,000
(laughter)

832
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
TALIESIN: Do you have any idea
where he's been off to?

833
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
MATT: "I haven't seen him leave."

834
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
(hammering noises)

835
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,800
TALIESIN: Well, I'm going to pop in
and check really quickly,

836
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,860
just letting you know.

837
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,260
MATT: "Your funeral."

838
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,000
(hammering noises)

839
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,920
TALIESIN: I gingerly open the door.
Can I check for traps?

840
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,000
TRAVIS: Attaboy.

841
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
MATT: You may. 
Make an investigation check.

842
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're standing right here.

843
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
TALIESIN: Oh, yay, that's not that bad.

844
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Investigation? I never use that.
11. No, 12. 12.

845
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,360
MATT: 12, okay.

846
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,600
(creak) You move the door open
and kind of search the ground

847
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,000
and the area before it
and the actual frame of the door itself.

848
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,060
No traps.

849
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,170
TALIESIN: All right.

850
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:16,000
MATT: Glancing inside, though,
you can see a little bit of light.

851
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,500
It looks like there's
a hooded lantern across the way

852
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,000
and just a little bit of light is flickering

853
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
and it's kind of 
going against the wall nearest to you,

854
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,389
to your right, as you enter.

855
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:28,000
The same familiar smell of fresh earth,

856
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
really, really, really dry dust

857
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:39,000
and a very familiar smell
of explosive black powder material.

858
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
TALIESIN: Oh, dear.

859
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
SAM: Is Victor in there?

860
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
TALIESIN: No, I don't see anybody in here.

861
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
SAM: Well, should we just

862
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,659
purchase what you need
via the honor system

863
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,210
and leave some coin behind?

864
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:54,770
TALIESIN: He's not necessarily
always a believer in coin.

865
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,750
Sometimes he just wants some trade.

866
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:00,000
Also, I need to talk to him 
about some personal issues.

867
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,440
MATT: (thud) You see off to the side,

868
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,260
what you didn't initially notice 
as you entered,

869
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:09,020
what appears to be a wooden trapdoor
in the far corner that (thud).

870
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,030
TALIESIN: Oh, sweet gods of Pelor!

871
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:14,430
MATT: (repeated thuds)

872
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:17,000
And you notice 
that apparently something--

873
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
a large sack 
of some heavy material

874
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,560
has rolled off a nearby table

875
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,000
and is now currently 
holding the door down.

876
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
TALIESIN: Okay.

877
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
MATT: You hear a muffled,
"I'm inside!"

878
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,500
TALIESIN: I'm going to go 
try and lift it.

879
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,000
TALIESIN: (grunts)

880
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
MATT: You lift it up, 
set it off to the side. (boosh)

881
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,600
"(coughing) What's going on?
You trying to kill me?"

882
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:45,000
TALIESIN: (laughs) No! Hello, Victor.
I was just to give you money.

883
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
You were stuck--
you had gotten stuck down--

884
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,280
what is down there?

885
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,710
MATT: "This is my mining building."

886
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,590
SAM: Your mine?

887
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,000
TALIESIN: His Mayan building.

888
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,370
Can you not 
understand simple English?

889
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:58,478
MATT: "Don't put things 
on top of the door.

890
00:35:58,478 --> 00:36:00,328
"It makes it hard to get out!"

891
00:36:00,328 --> 00:36:02,260
SAM: (whispering) 
Something's happened to him.

892
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,850
TALIESIN: Are you all right?

893
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:06,000
MATT: "I'm okay!"

894
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
TALIESIN: Are you sure?

895
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
MATT: "No, I've been locked 
down here for hours!"

896
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
ASHLEY: Oh no.

897
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,420
TALIESIN: Grog, Scanlan?

898
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:19,000
(stutters) Come on in, he's fine.

899
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
MATT: "Help me out!"

900
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
MATT: He raises his hands up.

901
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,930
You can see now,
where once was two, now is none.

902
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:29,000
(sounds of dismay)

903
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,630
MATT: (grunts)

904
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,000
LIAM: You have to build him a hand.
TALIESIN: I know.

905
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
MATT: (grunts)
"I can't wait all day, here!"

906
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
SAM: Grog, can you get him out,
can you lift him up?

907
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
TALIESIN: Grog, can you lift the poor--
TRAVIS: All right, yeah.

908
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,270
TRAVIS: I grab the stump
and I pick him up into the air.

909
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,000
MATT: (screams)

910
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,580
TRAVIS: I shake him a little bit.

911
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,730
TALIESIN: I need him mostly intact.

912
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,930
TRAVIS: Oh. So on the ground?

913
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,800
TALIESIN: Treat him slightly better
than you would treat

914
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,333
a member of your own family.

915
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:58,016
MATT: "Don't shake me too hard."

916
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:00,000
TALIESIN: More than slightly better. 
Much better.

917
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
LAURA: Oh, don't shake him too hard--
I'm not there.

918
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,053
TRAVIS: Oh. Gas.

919
00:37:04,053 --> 00:37:05,293
MATT: "Sure."

920
00:37:05,293 --> 00:37:07,000
TRAVIS: I put him gently 
back on the ground.

921
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
MATT: "Thank you."

922
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,580
He pats you on the head 
with his nub.

923
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,700
SAM: Ugh.

924
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,070
MATT: Goes over. You can see 
he's kind of bandaged.

925
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:17,030
He goes over and then pulls the ladder up
that he didn't use, closes the--

926
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:21,000
TRAVIS: (laughing) The ladder 
he didn't use?

927
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,220
MATT: "Okay. So. What do you want?"

928
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,200
TALIESIN: Well, I was hoping to buy

929
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,650
a little bit more black powder 
from you, if possible,

930
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,000
and I'm curious if you had 
anything else for sale,

931
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,830
and I wanted to ask you 
a couple of questions,

932
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:38,000
just about other customers again.

933
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,560
MATT: "That's a lot."
TALIESIN: I know.

934
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,620
MATT: "I have powder."

935
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,730
TALIESIN: You do.

936
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:47,000
MATT: "I can sell you more powder.
Question one: yes. How much?"

937
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
TALIESIN: One question?

938
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
LIAM: First question.

939
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
TALIESIN: First question.

940
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Has a one-armed lady, 
a one-handed lady,

941
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
a doctor come by to purchase--

942
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,405
MATT: "Not a lady. 
I am an honorable man!"

943
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,980
TRAVIS: Don't insult him.
TALIESIN: I know.

944
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:10,000
TALIESIN: And I would never 
insult your honor

945
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
or preferences of any kind.

946
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,188
MATT: "Are you saying I'm pretty?"

947
00:38:16,188 --> 00:38:19,000
TALIESIN: Victor, I think you know 
how I feel about that,

948
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
but you're 
a very attractive man, and--

949
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
MATT: "Your friend's hitting on me."
TRAVIS: I know it.

950
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,500
MATT: "I'm taken."

951
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,000
TRAVIS: He's taken.

952
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
TALIESIN: Are you dating right now?

953
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
MATT: "No, I'm just taken."

954
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
TALIESIN: Okay.

955
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,394
(laughs) I can't. 
I'm sorry. I'm good.

956
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,840
MATT: "(shouting) How much?"

957
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,500
TALIESIN: Well, I was going to offer,

958
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,000
I was originally going to offer 
some gold if you like,

959
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,046
but if you'd like,
I could make you a tool

960
00:38:45,046 --> 00:38:48,000
you could use 
with your current predicament.

961
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Some sort of simple
clawing mechanism

962
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
for grasping, lifting,
not getting caught in your mine.

963
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
MATT: "Maybe. Maybe.
Maybe a trade? Maybe a claw?"

964
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
TALIESIN: I love trade. 
Trade is brilliant.

965
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,325
MATT: "Build and bring.
Build and bring, and we trade."

966
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
TALIESIN: I would ask one other thing,
if I am to do this for you.

967
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,500
MATT: "Oh, so many questions!

968
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,000
"Does he have questions, too?
Does he have questions, too?!"

969
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,500
SAM: I do 
have a question, actually.

970
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,000
TALIESIN: You have a question?
SAM: Yes, I do.

971
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
TRAVIS: I don't, no. 
I don't have any questions. None.

972
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
MATT: (sighs) "I like him. 
What's your question?"

973
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,500
SAM: I'm just looking 
for a hat shop.

974
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,000
Is there a hat shop around here?

975
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
MATT: (considering noise)

976
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And he starts pulling around
from a pile of oiled rags and shit

977
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
and he pulls up
what looks like a small burlap sack

978
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
that's torn somewhat at the opening.

979
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
"Hat."

980
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
SAM: Oh, god. Ugh.
All right, thank you. Thank you.

981
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
MATT: "My pleasure. 
Happy to help." (chuckles)

982
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
SAM: Okay.

983
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
TALIESIN: That was everything
I could have hoped for, and more.

984
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
MATT: "Don't get near the fire."

985
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
TALIESIN: Really, don't.
SAM: Thank you.

986
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
TALIESIN: Has Dr. Ripley--
has a woman come by to buy black powder,

987
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,500
one hand, one mechanical hand,

988
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,000
one normal hand? Mechanical hand?

989
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
MATT: "Is that the one
you're saying you can make?"

990
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
TALIESIN: I'm going 
to make you something,

991
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,700
nice and useful claw piece, yes.

992
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,000
MATT: "So you're saying 
that this woman

993
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
"made a better hand 
than you can make?"

994
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,500
TALIESIN: No, I can make 
a better hand.

995
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,780
MATT: "Then make me a better hand!
Why would you give me a lesser hand?!"

996
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,080
TALIESIN: You're going to need to give me
quite a bit of black powder for that.

997
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,000
And more questions.

998
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
TRAVIS: Ooh.
MATT: "Really?"

999
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
(laughter)

1000
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,700
MATT: "I've had a bad day."

1001
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,260
TALIESIN: Is that recent?
SAM: That happened today?

1002
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,000
TALIESIN: It doesn't look that recent.

1003
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,500
MATT: (ripping sounds)

1004
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,000
He starts unwrapping the wound.

1005
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
TALIESIN: Oh, that's recent.
That's wet. That's very wet.

1006
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,340
MATT: It's pretty recent.

1007
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,974
TALIESIN: I can work with that.
I can work with that.

1008
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,640
I'm going to go construct you something

1009
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:48,020
that will be perfect for your needs.
I have a great idea.

1010
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:53,000
I will need another hogshead and a half 
of black powder

1011
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
and a little information
about another customer

1012
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
and then I will leave you 
to your work. Is that fair?

1013
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,500
MATT: "Fair!"

1014
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,430
He turns around, rushes over,
and grabs the same phantom hogshead

1015
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,650
that he has lying around his place.

1016
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:08,000
TALIESIN: He eats a lot of pork.

1017
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,650
MATT: Before he fills it with powder,
he goes over to Scanlan and goes,

1018
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:14,500
"(hums) Too big."

1019
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,000
TRAVIS: Good hat.

1020
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
MATT: Fills it with black powder,
carefully brings it over,

1021
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
holding it under his arm.

1022
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,660
(grunts)

1023
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:25,000
TALIESIN: Thank you. (grunts)

1024
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I will put this 
in something reasonable.

1025
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,680
I'll be back 
in just a little bit with--

1026
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,730
actually, do you have a glove
that you used to wear,

1027
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,940
or anything like that? 
Do you have something?

1028
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,000
MATT: "Yes!"

1029
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,810
He pulls out the glove 
that was on the hand,

1030
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:44,000
(laughing) and you can see
that it's blown apart,

1031
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,360
hand burned to cinders--

1032
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,960
TALIESIN: I can 
take measurements from that.

1033
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,880
MATT: It's more a sleeve 
with a charcoaled edge.

1034
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,000
TALIESIN: I'm going to be busy. 
Can you cast the--

1035
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
SAM: No, but Keyleth can,

1036
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
and I think that would save you 
a lot of time.

1037
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
MARISHA: I'm not here.
TALIESIN: She's not here.

1038
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
SAM: No, but we can go get her 
and come back.

1039
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,680
TALIESIN: To?
SAM: To just fix his hand.

1040
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,500
TALIESIN: I don't think 
she can just fix his hand.

1041
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,670
SAM: Someone can restore something.
Maybe Pike can.

1042
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:12,000
MARISHA: I can. 
Not today, but I can over time.

1043
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
TRAVIS: Want me to give it a try?

1044
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,670
TALIESIN: While I'm tempted-- 
would you just--

1045
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,333
I feel like I made a deal.

1046
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:21,000
I'm just going to have to see to it.

1047
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,190
SAM: I think he would prefer
a real hand than a claw hand.

1048
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,470
TALIESIN: Would you prefer 
a real hand or a claw hand?

1049
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:28,000
MATT: "Depends. 
How cool is the claw hand?"

1050
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,630
TRAVIS AND SAM: (laugh)

1051
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,410
TALIESIN: That's what I thought.

1052
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:35,000
SAM: I would much rather 
you spend time

1053
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
on projects for us 
than projects for him.

1054
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,500
TALIESIN: This is projects for us.

1055
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,590
TRAVIS: I vote for the claw. 
It's pretty cool.

1056
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,500
TALIESIN: And believe me, I would like--

1057
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,000
MATT: "Cooler than that lady's hand?"

1058
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,500
TALIESIN: Keeping him happy is pertinent.

1059
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,000
I can make this myself, 
it's just very difficult.

1060
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
SAM: We have party members
who can regrow his hand.

1061
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,510
TRAVIS: Hey, Percy.
TALIESIN: Yes?

1062
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:53,170
TRAVIS: He wants the claw to be cooler 
than that lady's claw hand.

1063
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,000
TALIESIN: That's very easy to do.
She has no aesthetics whatsoever.

1064
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,570
TRAVIS: All right. 
Then eff the old original hand.

1065
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,320
Let's give him 
a reasonable claw, yeah?

1066
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,500
TALIESIN: Don't worry about it.
SAM: All right.

1067
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,000
TALIESIN: It'll be fine.

1068
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,500
And if you can't do the mansion,

1069
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,000
I know where I can 
go get some work done.

1070
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,130
SAM: Oh, you want me to make--
we have the Slayer's Take.

1071
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:11,000
They have a workshop, don't they?

1072
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
TALIESIN: If not, I know
where I can work on something.

1073
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I will be back.

1074
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,840
I will not leave town
before I've delivered to you something--

1075
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,000
MATT: "(squawks)"

1076
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,770
He takes the hogshead.

1077
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:20,500
TALIESIN: Oh! Absolutely fair.

1078
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,000
MATT: "Trade when you bring hand."

1079
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,500
TALIESIN: Yes, of course.

1080
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:30,000
MATT: "Then I deliver with new hand.
Then all is well."

1081
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1082
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,650
MATT: "No more questions!"

1083
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:36,000
TALIESIN: No. That's fine.
We'll be back! It'll be good.

1084
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
MATT: "You're small."

1085
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
SAM: I need a big hat.

1086
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,710
MATT: "Can't help you, sorry."

1087
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:44,730
SAM: All right.

1088
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,630
TALIESIN: Are we going to go 
find a hat shop, then?

1089
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:49,000
SAM: Maybe, if we pass one.

1090
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
TALIESIN: All right. 
We will be back. Stay safe.

1091
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
MATT: "Okay. 
Don't touch the door, please!"

1092
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,430
TALIESIN: Yes. No. Just. 
We'll be back. Bye!

1093
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:04,060
TALIESIN: I'm going to go find
a workshop to work on something.

1094
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:07,000
TRAVIS: I like you. 
We'll see you later.

1095
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
MATT: "(chuckles) Heâ€™s big."

1096
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
TRAVIS: (chuckles)

1097
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
TALIESIN: And I'm just right.
It's... a thing.

1098
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
MATT: "I'm undecided about you."

1099
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,430
TALIESIN: You're not alone.

1100
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:22,000
I'm going to go see
if the Slayer's Take has--

1101
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,440
SAM: We're going to leave.

1102
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,930
TALIESIN: I cannot handle 
any more of that. That was brutal.

1103
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,000
SAM: Too good.

1104
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,220
TRAVIS: I feel like 
youâ€™re just on a higher level.

1105
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:33,000
ASHLEY: Right?
LAURA: So much.

1106
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,800
LAURA: I just thought you were
going to make him not there

1107
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,500
so you didn't have to do it.

1108
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,000
MATT: No no no.

1109
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,310
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah yeah.
He's just not home. Sorry, guys.

1110
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,000
ASHLEY: Oh, I love him.

1111
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,500
MARISHA: Victor's on vacation.

1112
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,410
TALIESIN: So, I'm going to go 
see if there's--

1113
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:48,000
if there's not a blacksmithing,

1114
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
if there's not somewhere I can do

1115
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
a bit of basic smithing work 
and technical work,

1116
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,560
then I'm going to go 
find that blacksmith from last time.

1117
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,940
MATT: There's basic materials to do

1118
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,500
essentially weapon repairs, 
armor repairs,

1119
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,000
minor armor construction
within the Slayer's Take.

1120
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,500
If you want something 
that's going to be

1121
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,580
a little more to the level 
of what you're doing,

1122
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,000
you may have to actually 
rent out a facility.

1123
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
TALIESIN: Well, I'm going to go find
that young chap from before.

1124
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
MATT: Okay. Yeah, easy enough to do.

1125
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
If you want to rent the forge 
for the day

1126
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
to craft whatever it is 
you're looking to craft,

1127
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,530
he's charging you 
50 gold for the day.

1128
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:23,000
TALIESIN: 50 gold for the day?

1129
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Can I use all of his tools
and just my own materials?

1130
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
MATT: You have to supply 
your own material, but he'll let you rent.

1131
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
TALIESIN: I'm going to run and find Vax,
get my stuff, and go to work.

1132
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,520
MATT: Okay. You guys.

1133
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,650
You four make your way
over towards the Duskmeadow.

1134
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:42,000
LAURA: Trinket's out.

1135
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
MATT: Trinket's out? (whoosh)

1136
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,810
(bear moans)

1137
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,000
LAURA: Come on, Trinket.

1138
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,650
MATT: (grunts)

1139
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:51,700
He rolls his head against you,
licks the side of your face,

1140
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:55,000
happy to be out 
of that stuffy little necklace.

1141
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
You make your way towards the Duskmeadow,
which you've seen before.

1142
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,240
It's a very comparatively...

1143
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,300
glum-looking area of the town,

1144
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,760
hence the name that accompanies it,

1145
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,000
but this is the area 
of the city that contains

1146
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:18,000
the Raven's Crest,
the Amaranthine Oubliette.

1147
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,000
It also contains 
the entire town's catacombs.

1148
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,480
This is where, 
since this town's existence,

1149
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,160
all of the dead are interred

1150
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:34,000
perpetually deeper and deeper and deeper
beneath this part of the city.

1151
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,620
Also one of
the oldest libraries of the city

1152
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,800
is kept here as well.

1153
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,660
As you approach the outskirts--
and you can see a very fine line

1154
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,800
between this area and the Birth Heart,

1155
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,000
which is the Melora section of the city.

1156
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
There is a very, very wide river divide
between the two of them

1157
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
and it's like night and day, 
back and back.

1158
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Very, very, very directly 
between the two of them.

1159
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
You can see on Melora's side
there's just stalks and stalks of corn

1160
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,000
and other vegetation 
that's being grown for food.

1161
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
There's almost like a lush forest
that curls around the outside of it

1162
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
that doesn't match 
the rest of the indigenous trees

1163
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
you've seen in this area of Othanzia.

1164
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,000
The entire Birth Heart area,
where this temple to Melora is,

1165
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
is just this

1166
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,790
plucked-out-of-nowhere section 
placed into it.

1167
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:28,190
And then you move over
to the Duskmeadow

1168
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:34,460
and it's just... like the color 
has left the vicinity.

1169
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,000
And there you see in the center
of this part of the town,

1170
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:43,530
this large, looming,
ominous obsidian and gold structure.

1171
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:47,500
It's like a giant black stone aerie.

1172
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,990
It has no intricacies 
from this distance that you can see.

1173
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:57,000
It's almost like a giant square building
that is just devoid of light,

1174
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
with little glimmers of gold
when the light catches it at moments.

1175
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,000
It's hard to miss

1176
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,710
and definitely stands as a centerpiece 
to this section of Vasselheim.

1177
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,240
LIAM: The whole walk over,

1178
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,840
I've been talking a lot,
mostly to Trinket.

1179
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,600
You know, scratching him 
behind the ears, saying,

1180
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:18,130
"Buddy, you've been 
trapped in there a while.

1181
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,710
"It's good to see you out."

1182
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:21,000
MATT: "(moans, snuffles)"

1183
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,550
LIAM: Come hug your uncle. Come.
LAURA: He doesn't mind it.

1184
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:26,000
LIAM: I'm sure he doesn't.
I'm just happy to see him.

1185
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
MATT: He presses his nose 
under yours

1186
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,050
and lifts your chin up
and you bite your lip a little

1187
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:32,000
from the sudden impact 
from this very large bear,

1188
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
but it's all with love.

1189
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
LIAM: Yeah. It's cold. You're sure 
you don't want to go back in?

1190
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,910
Nah, you don't want to go back in. 
I know.

1191
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:41,000
MARISHA: (whispering) Hey, Pike.

1192
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
LIAM: Just nervous talking 
the whole way there.

1193
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
MARISHA: (whispering) 
I think Vax is talking to himself.

1194
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
ASHLEY: (whispering) 
He's very nervous right now.

1195
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,710
ASHLEY: This is a big deal.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1196
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:55,000
ASHLEY: This temple is very...
it's lovely.

1197
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
MARISHA: It's gorgeous. 
It's very intimidating.

1198
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,020
Do you know anything about this?
You've lived here for a while, Pike.

1199
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,000
ASHLEY: I've never been by.

1200
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
MARISHA: Never been in?
ASHLEY: I've never been in, no.

1201
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
MATT: You do know from your time here
and what little you've heard

1202
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
that part of the purpose 
of this vicinity

1203
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,500
is not just to inter the dead
within part of these catacombs.

1204
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:22,000
The library here 
is kind of a loose partnership

1205
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,500
between the people worshipers of her
and those who follow Ioun.

1206
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:31,000
It is a center for knowledge and history
kept within the city.

1207
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,540
But you'll see throughout the town
and the landscaped outer wall

1208
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,740
that surrounds this entire portion 
of Vasselheim,

1209
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:45,020
there are repetitive glyphs
that line this entire area.

1210
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:48,840
And from what you've heard,
at the very least, most of these glyphs,

1211
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,000
which you see 
across the corners of roadways,

1212
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,820
and many of which surround
the entrance to the catacombs,

1213
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:02,620
it is a perpetual enchantment that is 
to seal any sort of possible undeath.

1214
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:05,380
There once was 
a terrible scourge of undeath

1215
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:08,000
in this part of the landscape, 
long ago,

1216
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
that corresponded with a battle 
hundreds of years ago,

1217
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,500
and since then, the reinforcement 
has been put in place

1218
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,000
to prevent that 
from happening again.

1219
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
So the downside is

1220
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,780
that the power of these glyphs 
that prevent undeath

1221
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:23,000
also prevent any actual vegetation
from existing in this area as well.

1222
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,680
So all the ground 
that you've come across:

1223
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,410
no grass, no natural vegetation.

1224
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:33,000
It's just dirt and ash and dust.

1225
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,970
MARISHA: Can we recognize the language
in which the runes come from?

1226
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:43,390
MATT: The magic itself 
is divine in nature,

1227
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:46,000
but it's based in the same
very, very base Draconic glyphs

1228
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
that a lot of arcane magic 
is based on.

1229
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,160
It's very-- it's <i>old</i> magic.

1230
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,100
ASHLEY: (laughs) It's old.

1231
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:58,010
MATT: Yeah. It's based 
in some sort of divine ritual.

1232
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,500
MARISHA: What did you say 
the name was

1233
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,000
of the Raven Queen's temple, again?

1234
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
MATT: The temple itself 
is referred to as Raven's Crest.

1235
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,340
MARISHA: Raven's Crest?

1236
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:07,500
MATT: Raven's Crest, yes.

1237
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,960
MARISHA: Okay.

1238
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,330
ASHLEY: How are you feeling, Vax?

1239
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:13,740
LIAM: I'm all right.

1240
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,880
I'm just going to talk 
to my sister for a minute.

1241
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,000
ASHLEY: Okay.

1242
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,000
LIAM: You know, 
I know you want to--

1243
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I know you.
I know you want to be here.

1244
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
LAURA: I know you don't 
want me to come.

1245
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
LIAM: I don't. 
I really don't.

1246
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,000
LAURA: I know. 
And I won't, if you're sure.

1247
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,130
I put you in this place 
and I feel terrible about it

1248
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:42,170
and I know you're extremely nervous.

1249
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:45,070
Trinket can sense it, too.
He's very in tune with those emotions.

1250
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:46,650
And I just--

1251
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:48,850
LIAM: Listen to me.

1252
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:52,620
You did not 
put me in this place.

1253
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:55,500
No one put me in this place.

1254
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,040
LIAM: And everything's going to be fine.
LAURA: Everything will be fine!

1255
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:02,890
LIAM: And I tug her sleeves
and make them a little more orderly

1256
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:07,580
and I move a bit of hair out of her face
and I do a button that's not done.

1257
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,000
LAURA: (laughs)

1258
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,730
LIAM: Everything's going to be fine.
LAURA: I wanted it unbuttoned, actually.

1259
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:16,020
LIAM: That's all right. Just wait here
I'll be out in a bit, all right?

1260
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:18,000
LAURA: Yes.
LIAM: Everything's fine.

1261
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,020
LAURA: I know. Everything's fine.
LIAM: Yeah.

1262
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,000
LAURA: You don't need 
to be nervous, either.

1263
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,500
LIAM: I'm not.

1264
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:28,000
LAURA: I will be here waiting for you
when you come out.

1265
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
LIAM: I know. I'll see you--

1266
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
LAURA: I love you.

1267
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
LIAM: You know I love you, too.

1268
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
LAURA: I'm proud of you, you know.

1269
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
She's just going to love you so much.

1270
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And who knows,

1271
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,500
you might have a new girlfriend 
when you come out.

1272
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,000
(laughs nervously, sighs)

1273
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,020
I've heard other people 
have dated gods before.

1274
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:49,000
I've heard it's done.
That Cashew guy. Anyway.

1275
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,500
LIAM: You're going 
to wait here for me, right?

1276
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,500
LAURA: I'll be right here.

1277
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,000
LIAM: And then I drop the smile

1278
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
as I walk off towards the other two.

1279
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
MATT: Okay.

1280
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Which, as you turn and look,

1281
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
when you originally approached

1282
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
the stairs that lead up to the entrance 
of this large structure,

1283
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
it was just empty, doors closed.

1284
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
There was no guard post 
on the outside.

1285
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
It was just these two looming,
almost dark glass-type doors

1286
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,050
about 12 feet tall
and about 8 feet wide on each side

1287
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:16,120
that are just locked shut.

1288
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,000
As soon as you turn 
to walk towards them,

1289
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
the doors open and you see a figure 
standing there at the door,

1290
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,500
just looking directly at you.

1291
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,750
Or at least you assume 
is looking right at you.

1292
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,000
It's hard to see.

1293
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
This individual, 
somewhat lithe in physicality,

1294
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
is wearing long, dark robes

1295
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
and their face is shrouded
in opaque black cloth,

1296
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
like a death shroud
that just blocks the entire face.

1297
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
You can see 
the hint of a jawline, a nose.

1298
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
It looks to be a person
of some background in there,

1299
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
but they're just standing there,
watching you.

1300
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,910
And as soon as you react 
to their appearance,

1301
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:52,880
the hand just beckons quietly.

1302
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,110
LIAM: Were you expecting me?

1303
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:01,000
All right.

1304
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,440
I've brought a couple of friends.
Is that permissible here?

1305
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:11,310
They'll keep quiet.

1306
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,550
MARISHA: I turn to Vex.

1307
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:16,000
LAURA: Keep him safe.

1308
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,990
MARISHA: I swear to you.

1309
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:21,840
We're all coming out of here alive.

1310
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,440
LAURA: I know.

1311
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,000
MARISHA: But if like an hour passes 
and we don't,

1312
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
maybe come in?

1313
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,500
But we're all 
coming out of here alive,

1314
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,500
so don't worry about it.

1315
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,640
It's fine.

1316
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,000
ASHLEY: And I squeeze her hand.

1317
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I'll make sure 
he gets out okay. I promise.

1318
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
LAURA: All right.
ASHLEY: Okay. Please be safe.

1319
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,630
LAURA: It'll be fine.
ASHLEY: It'll be fine. Yes.

1320
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:45,470
LAURA: I'll just be right here.
Waiting here with Trinket.

1321
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:46,500
ASHLEY: Okay.

1322
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,030
LAURA: Just calmly leaning 
against a wall. No big deal.

1323
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:50,000
ASHLEY: Okay.

1324
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,650
MARISHA: We've faced 
way more terrifying things

1325
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:58,000
than a few albeit creepy 
men in robes.

1326
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,530
LAURA: I don't even think she's that bad.

1327
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:01,159
She's not going to be bad.

1328
00:55:01,159 --> 00:55:02,237
LIAM: Guys.
LAURA: Just go.

1329
00:55:02,237 --> 00:55:04,250
ASHLEY: Okay. We'll go. 
We'll go in with you.

1330
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:05,570
MATT: All right.

1331
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:09,750
As you step up to the stairs,
the figure leads you all inside,

1332
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:13,840
and as you step into the main center
of this initial walkway chamber,

1333
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,800
the figure doesn't enter with you.

1334
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,510
It just closes the door behind you.

1335
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:18,670
(echoing thud)

1336
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:21,000
You can feel
the hint of vibration of impact

1337
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
as the doors close shut.

1338
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
MARISHA: It's dark?

1339
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,470
MATT: It's lowly-lit on the inside,
and it's interesting.

1340
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:28,000
From the outside, it looks like

1341
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
a black, solid,
impossible-to-see-through building.

1342
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
From the inside, 
you can actually look out

1343
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,370
and the entire building

1344
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:40,000
is made of this glass,
this somewhat-warped, dark glass.

1345
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,850
And you can see almost
the entirety of the outside

1346
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:44,960
from your position.

1347
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,830
The doors are held aloft into it.

1348
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:48,720
It's like a one-way 
type enchantment,

1349
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:53,300
or the construct, the material itself,
is somewhat translucent from this side.

1350
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:57,670
MARISHA: Like an interrogation room?
Like one-way mirror type of thing?

1351
00:55:57,670 --> 00:56:00,190
MATT: Kind of. Or like a very,
very dark pair of sunglasses,

1352
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:05,000
but made of naturally-formed rock, almost.

1353
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,900
LIAM: Noticing that, I turn

1354
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,890
and just sort of look at my sister
for 5 or 10 more seconds.

1355
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:16,130
MATT: She doesn't see you
and she just stands there quietly,

1356
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:19,000
looking around, 
inspecting the vicinity.

1357
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Pets Trinket a little.

1358
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
LIAM: (hesitantly) Let's do this.

1359
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,690
SAM: (chuckles)

1360
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:31,000
ASHLEY: Do I feel anything, 
being in here?

1361
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,670
MATT: You just feel 
a natural tremble

1362
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:37,000
stepping into a place 
of powerful divine influence

1363
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,430
that is not 
the warm comfort of Sarenrae,

1364
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,000
which has protected you before.

1365
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Now, you understand the way
many deities work in these lands,

1366
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
and your place in it,
and Sarenrae's place in it,

1367
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
and you know enough 
about the Raven Queen

1368
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
to know that this is not 
an unwelcome place, per se.

1369
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Go ahead and roll a religion check.

1370
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
ASHLEY: 23.

1371
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,000
MATT: 23. 
You understand the Raven Queen

1372
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,520
has also not always been

1373
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:19,000
the one who holds sway

1374
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
over the domain of death,
the domain of winter,

1375
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
the domain of fate.

1376
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Once mortal,
the Raven Queen ascended

1377
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,330
as, essentially, a follower
and a partner

1378
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:34,210
to the previous god of death,

1379
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:37,000
which his name
has been erased from the books.

1380
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:44,000
This mortal ascended many,
many years ago, pre-Second Spark,

1381
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
and has since taken what was once

1382
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
a tyrannical position of death
and afterlife and souls

1383
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
and took it instead
as the natural transition that it is.

1384
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
However, 
due to a lack of respect,

1385
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,000
or at least, a lack of, 
for lack of a better term,

1386
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,330
belief or trust from the other gods,

1387
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:13,000
she only gained dominion
over the actual moment of transition,

1388
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
not of the actual souls 
of the afterlife.

1389
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
That influence was given to others.

1390
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
But the Raven Queen represents

1391
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
one of the most feared elements of life,

1392
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,500
which is the end of it,

1393
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:33,000
but you also know 
that that is a natural thing.

1394
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Your personal belief is up to you.

1395
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
The sense you get here is that...

1396
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,280
being an individual 
that worships life,

1397
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:47,000
that worships redemption,
that worships second chances,

1398
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
you can't help
but swallow a little hard

1399
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
at the idea of a god that's purpose
is to make sure

1400
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,010
that if you're destined 
to have once chance,

1401
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:56,510
it stays one chance.

1402
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:58,230
ASHLEY: Okay.

1403
00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:00,500
MATT: As you begin 
to walk down this hall,

1404
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,000
ever so slow as it is,

1405
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,190
each footfall deafening 
in the clack.

1406
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:08,000
(clicking footsteps)

1407
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
The hallway leads on
for another hundred feet or so

1408
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:16,000
before the glass,
somewhat translucent material

1409
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
shifts into the next chamber,

1410
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,500
into an almost

1411
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:23,000
deep gray and ivory ice-like interior.

1412
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
The dark,
coal-black exterior you've seen

1413
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
now transitions into what feels like

1414
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,180
a very finely-carved 
piece of architecture

1415
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:33,630
from ice and bone.

1416
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:38,700
MARISHA: Do I get the sense
as a druid, as an Ashari,

1417
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:42,000
that we've switched into another plane?

1418
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,420
MATT: Go ahead and roll an arcana check,

1419
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:51,000
as this is not so much
a nature-based thing, yeah.

1420
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
MARISHA: Oh! I rolled a 19. 
(laughs) 21.

1421
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
LIAM: Oh dear, oh my.
LAURA: Oh gosh, oh jeez.

1422
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,720
MARISHA: Oh goodness gracious.

1423
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,000
MATT: From your understanding

1424
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,500
of transitional magic between planes,

1425
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,000
there has been
no actual shift between planes,

1426
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
it's just the material itself

1427
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,000
is different upon the interior
of this building.

1428
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,500
As soon as you enter this place,

1429
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,000
you do see another figure
walking towards you.

1430
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Similar long, dark robes.

1431
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
However, the veil 
has been pulled back,

1432
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,230
and you see before you 
what looks to be

1433
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:29,000
an older elven woman with very, 
very bright silver hair

1434
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,000
that just kind of falls long,
past her shoulders,

1435
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,000
down to her back about mid-waist,
or down to the bottom of her waist.

1436
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
With a smile.

1437
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:45,000
You can see as she walks towards you,
a very welcoming grin.

1438
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
As she approaches,
she pays very little mind to you three,

1439
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,500
but directly to you, says,

1440
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,000
LAURA: (whispers) I'm not there.

1441
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
MATT: "You walk with Her sight on you.

1442
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
"You are ever welcome here."

1443
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:00,460
LIAM: I've come

1444
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:07,000
to understand
my place in Her sight.

1445
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,020
MATT: "Then I think, perhaps, 
you are here for communion.

1446
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:19,000
"Come. Our most sacred chamber.
The communion pool awaits.

1447
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,350
"Only you may have entry,
unfortunately."

1448
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,600
LIAM: Right.

1449
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,010
LIAM: I plant a kiss on the cheek 
of each of the women.

1450
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
MARISHA: Do you need anything
before you go in?

1451
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Any enhancement of any kind?

1452
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
LIAM: Just cross 
your fingers for me, okay?

1453
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
MARISHA: Okay.

1454
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,750
I just kind of squeeze his hand.

1455
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,000
ASHLEY: Same.

1456
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Be careful.

1457
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
MARISHA: We're right out here
on the other side of this door.

1458
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:09,000
If anything terrible happens,
you have the earpiece.

1459
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
No one will stop Pike and I
from getting through there

1460
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
if something terrible goes wrong.

1461
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,500
Rules be damned.

1462
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:24,000
LIAM: I made my bed. Now I gotta lie in it.

1463
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I'll see you soon.

1464
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,590
I follow.

1465
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:33,060
MATT: "Come, champion. 
The Lady of Fates awaits."

1466
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:36,000
And she turns around
and leads you 30 more feet

1467
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
to what looks to be
an ascending staircase

1468
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,760
that just enters
up and out of the sight of you two.

1469
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:47,780
ASHLEY: We'll just hang out, yeah?

1470
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:50,000
MARISHA: I guess we'll wait, yeah.

1471
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
MATT: You ascend
a few feet behind her,

1472
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
about 40 or so feet,

1473
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
until it comes
to a single large doorway

1474
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
of deep, deep dark oak wood

1475
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
with what looks to be
a dark iron ring in the center.

1476
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,930
As she steps up to it, she takes it 
and (thud) knocks on it twice.

1477
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:17,170
(deep creak) It just shifts open
and leads into a central chamber now

1478
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:22,000
that looks about a hundred feet high,

1479
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,540
and it is a large steepled dome

1480
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:28,000
of what looks to be nothing
but stained glass.

1481
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
It's awe-inspiring.

1482
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
It's beautiful: the colors,
the light as it peeks through.

1483
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
The source of light,
diffused as it is by the clouds,

1484
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,500
is sourceless in here.

1485
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,000
It seems like there are beams of light
coming from all directions

1486
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,500
and all the colors
are just strewn across the floor

1487
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:47,630
in what looks like this
perpetually-shifting kaleidoscope

1488
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:54,390
of dots of reds and blues and purples
and yellows and pinks and whites.

1489
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:59,000
You can see, across the room,
there are three other figures

1490
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,840
that are all dressed
in the same dark robes,

1491
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:05,000
the veils over their heads,
of varying size.

1492
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
You can't make out
what their racial background is, per se,

1493
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,500
but they are all stationed
around the center of the room,

1494
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,000
in which lies, from what you can see,

1495
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:21,000
a very, very large round pool
of some sort of deep crimson liquid.

1496
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
LIAM: I have come to pay a debt,

1497
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:37,580
and I do so gladly
and without question.

1498
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,910
What would you have of me?

1499
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
MATT: "You came to speak with the Lady.

1500
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
"Well, the way is before you."

1501
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,050
She gestures to the pool.

1502
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
LIAM: I walk slow and straight in.

1503
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,610
MATT: You step into it. (squelch)

1504
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:02,000
It comes up to your ankles,
to your knees.

1505
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
And what catches you first
is that the liquid is very thick.

1506
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
It is viscous in a familiar way.

1507
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
This is most definitively
a pool of blood.

1508
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,000
And it is cold. It is ice-cold.

1509
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
As you step in, you can feel that
as it begins to seep into your boots

1510
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,600
and begins to find its way
into the crevices of your outfit

1511
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:27,000
as you get down into your waist,
it's just chilling.

1512
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
You can't help but to stand up straight
as you step further in,

1513
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
not quite sure of how deep it gets.

1514
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
And it gets deeper. And deeper.

1515
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Up past your chest,
up past your shoulders,

1516
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,940
and you're not even
halfway into the center of the pool

1517
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:43,000
before it's going past your nose.

1518
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,790
LIAM: I keep going.

1519
01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:49,000
MATT: You take your last breath, hold it,

1520
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
and submerge yourself in the pool.

1521
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,750
Darkness around you,
the cold sensation.

1522
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:59,850
Nothing...

1523
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:03,060
Nothing...

1524
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:07,590
Nothing...

1525
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:12,150
LIAM: I open my mouth and inhale.

1526
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:16,590
MATT: As you do, 
you feel the blood fill your lungs

1527
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:21,000
and immediately your lungs begin to seize
with the lack of oxygen.

1528
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
You instinctually begin
to reach up for the water and pull,

1529
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
but you can't rise.

1530
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
You can't get up.

1531
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,940
And at that point, the cold, piercing pain
of the liquid in your lungs

1532
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:36,000
becomes warm.

1533
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
All the liquid around you
becomes warm.

1534
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,050
And in the darkness,
where you cannot see,

1535
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:45,790
you calm, as suddenly your breathing
is no longer difficult.

1536
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:48,360
It's natural. It's like air.

1537
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:57,420
And it's reminiscent
of being in the womb,

1538
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,640
of the moment of birth
you'd forgotten so long ago,

1539
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:03,000
that you're just surrounded
in darkness and comfort.

1540
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,790
And piercing the center
of this darkness before you,

1541
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:07,470
you see
a very faint bead of white light

1542
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:12,000
just begin to spark
and grow, and grow,

1543
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
and as that light widens out,
it becomes a face.

1544
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
A porcelain face.

1545
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:24,000
A nose, lips, a chin,
empty dark sockets,

1546
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,690
long dark hair
that goes to crimson and surrounds you.

1547
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,690
You see a small hand
reach up behind

1548
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:36,000
and lift you from your legs.

1549
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,880
And for what you thought
was only a few feet of liquid,

1550
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,000
you look around you
and it is an endless space,

1551
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
a space you've been before,

1552
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,000
a space that you once visited
in your sleep, in your dreams.

1553
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,500
You look down below and you can see

1554
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:54,910
the infinite skein of threads
that you were once given inspection to.

1555
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:59,000
As you look down, you see the very palm
of the Raven Queen

1556
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
holding you aloft in this space

1557
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
as the mask
pulls in close to you with a smile.

1558
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,500
The lips don't move,

1559
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:09,000
but you hear a voice
from all directions in your head.

1560
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,210
A comforting voice.
A welcoming voice.

1561
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
"My champion.

1562
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,580
"Vax'ildan.
You've come to me at last."

1563
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:27,410
LIAM: This was always
supposed to happen, wasn't it?

1564
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
MATT: "There is destiny,

1565
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
"but you still guide your path
where it must go.

1566
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
"Especially you, fate-touched.

1567
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:44,020
"You're one of the few 
that bends threads near and around you.

1568
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:47,000
"That's why you're 
so interesting to me."

1569
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,000
LIAM: (haltingly)
I give myself willingly to you

1570
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,569
for the bargain that was struck,

1571
01:09:04,569 --> 01:09:08,000
although I question
if the bargain

1572
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,000
was just the surface reason
for this to happen.

1573
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:19,740
MATT: "When one such as your...

1574
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:25,430
"unique essence walks these realms,

1575
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:29,000
"do not think I am
the only one to take interest.

1576
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,689
"And do not think you are
the only one, either.

1577
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
"But I was there
to seize the opportunity when it arose,

1578
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,000
"and as such, you are now mine.

1579
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:46,000
"And I know that you hate me.
I know that you fear me.

1580
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
"Most do.

1581
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,390
"But only because they are
without understanding.

1582
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:57,000
"Without death, life has no meaning.

1583
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,590
"Finality drives change,

1584
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:01,840
"innovation,

1585
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:04,030
"greatness.

"It is the end that I bring

1587
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:13,000
"that drives all of your gracious creations
of this land

1588
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,470
"to make the world better than we did,
than those before me did."

1589
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
LIAM: I would learn your ways.

1590
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I will learn your purpose.

1591
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
And I will serve.

1592
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,450
MATT: "Then understand
the wholeness of what it is you serve

1593
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:39,000
"and what you represent, champion.

1594
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
"Even after death, the soul is carried
to another purpose,

1595
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,560
"but it is that transition
where it is at its most vulnerable.

1596
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:55,000
"It is my charge, my gift--
your gift, now--

1597
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,550
"to safeguard that beautiful moment.

1598
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
"There are those that find
the immortal soul

1599
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:09,580
"one of the most pure
and powerful means

1600
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:14,950
"of energy, of sourced power,
in this world.

1601
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
"That is an abomination.

1602
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,000
"There are those
that wish to halt the process

1603
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,590
"and live eternally
in some form of undeath or the other.

1604
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:30,000
"That is an abomination.

1605
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
"There is also a difference

1606
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,000
"between bending your thread 
around destiny, fate-touched,

1607
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
"and perverting the thread entirely,

1608
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
"for death is sacred.

1609
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
"But not all deaths are destined,
in that moment.

1610
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
"Some destinies require one
to endure beyond the moment.

1611
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,000
"To meet that moment many times
before the final death is to come.

1612
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
"We must guide these moments
across this web."

1613
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
And as she sweeps her hand out.

1614
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,270
Where she holds you in one palm,
another hand reaches out,

1615
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:08,000
and the entire web of threads
just glows below you

1616
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
in this curling wave
out into infinity, into the horizons,

1617
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
endless, to each side of you and beyond.

1618
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,000
"So, to bend destiny, 
to bend these fates,

1619
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
"is within our sphere of influence.

1620
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
"It's those that find a way
to cheat this destiny,

1621
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
"halt the progression,

1622
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,000
"corrupt their thread to the point
it sickens those around them.

1623
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
"Undeath, wayward necromancy.

1624
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,000
"Perversion
of the sanctity of the cycle,

1625
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
"of our very domain, is an atrocity

1626
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:51,000
"and must be stopped 
and stamped out.

1627
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,000
"That is our cause.

1628
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,640
"Your cause, now.

1629
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,160
"Do you still accept this gift?"

1630
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,630
LIAM: (whispering) I do.

1631
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,780
MATT: "You, Vax'ildan.
I've had my eye on you for some time."

1632
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,000
And the smile curls
into this much wider smile.

1633
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:25,000
To the point it seems 
somewhat perturbing.

1634
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:31,000
"Your dual nature:
rushing prematurely towards your end,

1635
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
"wantonly throwing your life
before the flames,

1636
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
"only to pull away
in those last moments.

1637
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
"Instinct.

1638
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:45,000
"You test your path constantly,
without knowing

1639
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,850
"you've been preparing 
for this mantle your entire life.

1640
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
"My beautiful champion."

1641
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
The smile subsides.

1642
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:05,000
The face goes stone.
Lack of expression. Blank.

1643
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
The hand pulls back
and you now can see

1644
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
the full immensity of her size.

1645
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,770
Her body infinitely long, 
looking down

1646
01:14:12,770 --> 01:14:15,000
before it disappears 
into darkness.

1647
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
And as you look up,

1648
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,500
suddenly the mask
is there before you,

1649
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:22,000
but normal, human-sized.

1650
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
You're no longer in her hand.

1651
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,870
You're standing on a floor,

1652
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:29,810
a floor of the same white,
ice-bone type substance

1653
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:35,000
that the interior of Raven's Crest
seems to be built from.

1654
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
And for a brief moment,
you see before you

1655
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,000
the woman before the god,
the ascended mortal,

1656
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
no larger than you.

1657
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
From the hair
that topples down the sides,

1658
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,990
the hand reaches up
and grabs the mask and pulls it away.

1659
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:57,000
Beneath the mask you see

1660
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,430
a very beautiful, 
very sad-looking woman.

1661
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:07,000
But her eyes 
are cold and red in the iris.

1662
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,850
Her skin flawless and smooth.
White, pale, sunless.

1663
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:15,000
Her brows thinned and furrowed.

1664
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
She steps forward
and touches the side of your face.

1665
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,720
"There are those
who will be frightened of you.

1666
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,890
"But know what we do

1667
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:35,160
"is one of the most important gifts 
of all."

1668
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
And she grabs your head, 
pulls you down,

1669
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,940
and kisses you on the forehead.

1670
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:46,000
At which point, suddenly your lungs 
fill once again with searing white pain.

1671
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
You find yourself scrambling about,

1672
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,760
instinctually spilling out liquid
all around you,

1673
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,500
and you finally (coughs) come out 
on top of the communion pool.

1674
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,500
Your eyes open and you can see 
just red crimson pouring in your vision.

1675
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:03,000
You rub it out
and you're in the chamber alone.

1676
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Eyes wide, swimming around,

1677
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,000
you can see the figures on the side
come to the edges.

1678
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,610
They all bow.

1679
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,000
The figure that led you in

1680
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
stands at the mouth of this pool
where you entered.

1681
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,500
She's smiling.
She has her hand extended.

1682
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,000
LIAM: I take it.

1683
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,500
MATT: She lifts you out of the pool.

1684
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,000
One of the other figures runs up

1685
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,700
and takes
one of the dark robes that they have

1686
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,200
and pulls it off around them,

1687
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:37,000
revealing just a simple
dark blue and black outfit beneath.

1688
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Still wearing the veil,
but wraps the dark robe around you

1689
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,000
as the liquid is now
back to its freezing cold sensation.

1690
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Your teeth are chattering.

1691
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
They lead you back
to the door you entered,

1692
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,500
down the stairs,
and into the central chamber

1693
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:56,000
where both Keyleth and Pike await.

1694
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
You guys turn and see,
descending the stairs,

1695
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,470
being flanked, essentially,

1696
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:05,000
by two of the members
of the Raven's Crest,

1697
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,000
both of the shoulders
with the dark robe wrapped around

1698
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:14,000
a very cold and somewhat
freaked-out looking Vax'ildan,

1699
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,620
who has smeared red across his face.

1700
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:21,000
His hair is thick
with viscous crimson liquid.

1701
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,370
ASHLEY: I run over.
You okay?

1702
01:17:24,370 --> 01:17:28,030
MARISHA: I stand
at the bottom of the stairs and I watch.

1703
01:17:28,030 --> 01:17:31,000
LIAM: (hoarsely)
I got answers in there,

1704
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,770
but they led to more questions.

1705
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:37,000
What am I to do
with those questions?

1706
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
MATT: The woman
who had led you in there

1707
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
smiles and says,

1708
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
"That is the nature of death.

1709
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
"We can't have all the answers,
my friend.

1710
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
"It is the pursuit of those answers
that drives us.

1711
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:54,000
"Do you trust Her?"

1712
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,560
LIAM: I do.

1713
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:02,000
MATT: "Then perhaps
you'll find those answers one day."

1714
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:08,860
LIAM: Thank you.

1715
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,300
MATT: "Thank you."

1716
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,500
They pull the robe off

1717
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:18,470
and they all head
back up into the chamber,

1718
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:21,000
leaving you all there
in the room alone.

1719
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,090
MARISHA: I walk over.

1720
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,270
ASHLEY: (whispering)
I'm just going to stay where he is.

1721
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,540
LIAM: I'm shell-shocked.

1722
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:42,710
MARISHA: You look well.

1723
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
LIAM: It's going to be good.

1724
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:53,000
MARISHA: What did she say to you?
Did she speak to you at all?

1725
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,530
LIAM: (whispering) Yeah.

1726
01:18:59,530 --> 01:19:01,480
MARISHA: (shocked laugh)

1727
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,300
LIAM: Do you speak?

1728
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
ASHLEY: Yes?
LIAM: To her?

1729
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,750
ASHLEY: Sometimes.

1730
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,560
LIAM: Do you understand?

1731
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,000
ASHLEY: I don't think
any of us can fully understand.

1732
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,000
I think, if we did,
then we would be gods.

1733
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,350
MARISHA: Do you believe?

1734
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:50,160
LIAM: Yeah. Yeah. I do.

1735
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:56,850
I don't know what...
I don't know why, but...

1736
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,000
this was fate.

1737
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
MARISHA: Is that what she told you,
that this was fate?

1738
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
LIAM: No.

1739
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
I know it here.

1740
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,320
MARISHA: Why?

1741
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:29,820
LIAM: Everything has led to it.

1742
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:35,990
You and I wouldn't be standing here
if my sister hadn't stolen a broom.

1743
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:39,850
Where's the sense in that?

1744
01:20:39,850 --> 01:20:41,850
What else is it?

1745
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:53,000
I teleported into the stomach of a dragon
with a gnome

1746
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
and I am still standing here.

1747
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
If it is not fate, what is it?

1748
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
MARISHA: I don't know.

1749
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:12,700
As someone
who is constantly questioning mine,

1750
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:15,160
I don't think
I'm the right person to ask.

1751
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
But I do know one thing--

1752
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
and I grab his hands--

1753
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:31,000
you were amazing
and talented and special

1754
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
way before she found you.

1755
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:41,000
If anything,
we can call her a god.

1756
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,000
We can also call her
a great opportunist.

1757
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,420
She didn't give you
anything special.

1758
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,760
The Vax that I see before me right now

1759
01:21:56,760 --> 01:22:01,000
is no different than the Vax
that I saw before me ten minutes ago.

1760
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,500
I'm not saying

1761
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:15,000
that what you experienced
wasn't real and true.

1762
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,780
I believe you whole-heartedly.

1763
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
LIAM: This is real.

1764
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
This was meant to be.

1765
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,000
And I am on board.

1766
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,800
MARISHA: Is it what was meant to be
or what you just really wanted?

1767
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:42,000
And it found you?

1768
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:46,890
LIAM: (disbelieving laughter)

1769
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:49,890
It is not what I wanted.

1770
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Thank you. Thank you.

1771
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,270
I need to see my sister.

1772
01:23:06,770 --> 01:23:09,000
And I head off towards the exit.

1773
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,000
MATT: You guys make your way
to the outside of Raven's Crest.

1774
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,500
The doors open once again.

1775
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:16,000
The figure that let you in
is waiting for you, opens the door.

1776
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,500
As you see the doors open--

1777
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:20,000
LAURA: I jump up immediately.
I've bitten off all my fingernails.

1778
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
MATT: (laughs) Rushing down the stairs,
you see Pike, Keyleth,

1779
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,000
and your brother

1780
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,410
in a little better spirits
than when he first entered,

1781
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:31,000
if a little damper and redder.

1782
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,500
LAURA: Is that blood?
Is that blood all over you?

1783
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,000
Did she hurt you?

1784
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
LIAM: It was really weird, 
but it's fine.

1785
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I told you I'd be fine, 
and I'm fine.

1786
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
LAURA: I get out a rag
and I start wiping everything off.

1787
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
(laughs) You're alive, though.

1788
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
LIAM: (laughs) Yeah,
doesn't make any sense, does it.

1789
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,500
LAURA: (laughing) Oh my god,
are you stronger now?

1790
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,000
Are you so strong?

1791
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
LIAM: I think I might be
a bit weaker, actually.

1792
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
LAURA: Oh, I don't believe it.
LIAM: I have the jelly-legs.

1793
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,500
LAURA: (laughs) Do you want
to ride Trinket for a while?

1794
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,000
LIAM: Could I?
LAURA: Yes!

1795
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,000
LIAM: He's going to get sticky.
LAURA: No, he loves the taste of blood.

1796
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,360
MATT: (sad moaning)

1797
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,500
LAURA: (laughs) Oh, Trinket.

1798
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,000
MATT: Trinket comes over

1799
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,860
and begrudgingly lowers himself
so you can climb on.

1800
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:11,500
LIAM: No, don't lick.
Don't lick.

1801
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:14,000
LAURA: He's very light.
Scrawny, scrawny, scrawny.

1802
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
LIAM: But don't lick, Trink, please.

1803
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,390
MATT: (grunts)

1804
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:20,000
ASHLEY: Just one kiss?
One little lick?

1805
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
LAURA: (laughs)

1806
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
LIAM: Later, buddy. Later.

1807
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,000
LIAM: I climb on top.

1808
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,000
LAURA: Aren't you glad
you got out of the Pokeball for this?

1809
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,990
LIAM: I give a quick look
back at my friends.

1810
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
and then I take a nap on Trinket.

1811
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,230
MATT: Okay.

1812
01:24:44,230 --> 01:24:48,000
LAURA: So everything's good, then.
He's good? Everything's fine?

1813
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,000
ASHLEY: I think so... I mean, it's--
it was very different,

1814
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
but that doesn't mean it's wrong.

1815
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
LAURA: He talked to her?
MARISHA: He talked to her.

1816
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,500
LAURA: Were you there?
ASHLEY: No.

1817
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,000
MARISHA: They didn't let us 
in the room.

1818
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,140
LAURA: Oh. Well, I'll find out.

1819
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:04,450
MARISHA: We stood outside.

1820
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:07,910
He didn't talk much about it.
Maybe you can find out more.

1821
01:25:07,910 --> 01:25:12,000
All he said was
that he knows that this was fate.

1822
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
LAURA: Well, good.
He has a purpose.

1823
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,670
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1824
01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:18,750
MARISHA: Oh. Yeah.
Well, that's one way of looking at it.

1825
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:19,800
LIAM: (snores)

1826
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,500
LAURA: I keep him steady
and I walk next to him.

1827
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:22,500
MATT: Okay.

1828
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,000
You guys eventually make your way
back to the Slayer's Take.

1829
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
The three of you guys...

1830
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,500
what are you doing
while this is transpiring?

1831
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,000
TRAVIS: Eating my mechanical pencil.

1832
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
(laughter)

1833
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
TALIESIN: I've sent him
with a shopping list.

1834
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,500
MATT: Okay.

1835
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,000
What have they been sent to acquire?

1836
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,370
TALIESIN: I'm going to need
a cheap gauntlet, some saddling straps,

1837
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:45,000
three tankards, a pick-axe,
and two clocks.

1838
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,000
MATT: All right.
How much gold do you give him?

1839
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,220
LAURA: You've got--

1840
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:54,000
TALIESIN: That's right, I've got.

1841
01:25:57,580 --> 01:26:02,000
SAM: Four gold.
TALIESIN: (snorts) I give--

1842
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
LAURA: You've also got
a five-pound bag of gems, don't forget.

1843
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
TALIESIN: I do. I give him--

1844
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,150
MARISHA: (giggles)

1845
01:26:09,150 --> 01:26:11,000
TALIESIN: This is what happens.
MARISHA: Is that Riegel?

1846
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,500
TALIESIN: That was Riegel.
MARISHA: (giggles)

1847
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,430
TALIESIN: Don't read that.
That's not necessary.

1848
01:26:14,430 --> 01:26:17,000
SAM: (singing) I drew a dick
on his picture.

1849
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
(laughter)

1850
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:23,000
TALIESIN: And I need
that man's dick to finish the arm.

1851
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
MATT: That'll go over well.

1852
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
TALIESIN: Despite the dick on my page,

1853
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:33,000
I'm going to give Scanlan 100 gold
to take with Grog

1854
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:37,000
to find some junk items
that they can put together.

1855
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,250
SAM: I'm going with Grog to shop?
All right, sure.

1856
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:40,770
TALIESIN: If you're down.

1857
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:43,000
SAM: Yeah. I'll do it.
Yeah, we'll go for all that stuff.

1858
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Do we find success?

1859
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
MATT: I want you guys
to go ahead and roll--

1860
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,650
actually, for you, just roll
a general charisma check

1861
01:26:50,650 --> 01:26:53,000
to ask around and get people
to give you the proper information.

1862
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,500
TALIESIN: I love you.

1863
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,000
SAM: What is this, just charisma?

1864
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,500
MATT: You just add
your charisma modifier.

1865
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,000
SAM: 18.
MATT: 18?

1866
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,790
MATT: Yeah, within a very brief period
of talking to the right people

1867
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:06,000
and smiling and getting folks
to listen back to you,

1868
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
eventually you're given information

1869
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:13,000
on where each piece of that list
is able to be found.

1870
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
They're not too crazy items.

1871
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,000
There's a lot in general stores,
general armor--

1872
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
TALIESIN: I don't even need
an articulated gauntlet.

1873
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,500
It just needs to be a clamp.

1874
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:24,000
MATT: Yeah, just a basic
clamp gauntlet.

1875
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,000
SAM: Do we also find a hat store?

1876
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,150
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'd better.
LAURA: You want another beret?

1877
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:31,020
MATT: Not in the Braving Grounds,

1878
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:34,500
but you can definitely find one
on your journey in the Quad Roads.

1879
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,000
SAM: If I can take

1880
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,500
an extra side journey
to find a hat shop,

1881
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,000
that would be great.

1882
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,500
MATT: Do you go with him?

1883
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:43,000
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah.

1884
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
SAM: It's just hats, Grog.
We're just getting hats.

1885
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
MATT: You guys make your way
to the busy streets of the Quadroads.

1886
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,500
Eventually, asking around,

1887
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,000
you find yourself 
across from what is called

1888
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
the Sore Socket Haberdashery.

1889
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,380
SAM: The Sore Socket?
MATT: Sore Socket Haberdashery.

1890
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:55,630
TRAVIS: I love it.
SAM: I love it.

1891
01:27:55,630 --> 01:27:57,580
MATT: And the picture outside

1892
01:27:57,580 --> 01:28:01,000
has a caricature of a guy,
smiling, with a giant black eye.

1893
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
SAM: (laughs)

1894
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
MATT: You walk inside and it's like

1895
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:10,000
a small, localized bar--
not a tavern by any means,

1896
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,500
but it has like
one small set-up in there

1897
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:13,000
for just general beer,

1898
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
and just loads and loads of hats.

1899
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Leathers, cloth,
all kinds of silly circumstances.

1900
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
You see some nice fancy hats
with big feather plumes.

1901
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,620
You see joking hats
that have multiple colors

1902
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:28,000
and what looks to be
bells hanging from them.

1903
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
As you step into the room,

1904
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,040
you see two other random individuals
that are looking around, shopping,

1905
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:34,000
and at the far end,

1906
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,500
you see coming through
a big thing of curtains

1907
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:38,000
what looks to be

1908
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,000
a rather rotund woman
in her late 40s or so.

1909
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Big curls in her dark brown hair

1910
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,620
and maybe a little too much makeup
on her face, who goes,

1911
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:47,500
"Darlings, what are you looking for?

1912
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,530
"What can I get you?
Are you looking for hats?"

1913
01:28:49,530 --> 01:28:51,000
SAM: Oh, man.

1914
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
MATT: "I assume
you're looking for hats."

1915
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
SAM: Wow. Yeah,
we've come to the right place.

1916
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
TRAVIS: The guys
are missing out on this one.

1917
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,500
(laughter)

1918
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:03,730
SAM: Hi, ma'am.
My name's Scanlan. This is Grog.

1919
01:29:03,730 --> 01:29:06,000
We're just-- I needed one hat,

1920
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,190
but you have
such a fantastic selection,

1921
01:29:08,190 --> 01:29:09,520
maybe we'll pick up a few.

1922
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:13,000
SAM: How much money
do I have left over from his hundo?

1923
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:17,000
MATT: After all those materials,
I'd say probably,

1924
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
asking around
and your high charisma,

1925
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
you probably have about 60.

1926
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,500
TRAVIS: Bro, we got money.

1927
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:24,000
SAM: Let's get some hats!

1928
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,000
MATT: "My name is Deidre, dear,
so nice to meet you."

1929
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,000
SAM: It's lovely to meet you.
MATT: "You're so adorable."

1930
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,500
SAM: We've heard so much 
about this store.

1931
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,000
MATT: "Really?"
SAM: Yes, far and wide.

1932
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,000
MATT: "Oh ho,
I can guarantee you, it's all true.

1933
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,000
"And you, you're so big,
you're so strapping."

1934
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
TRAVIS: I am.
MATT: "And that beard!"

1935
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
MATT: She kind of tousles
the beard with her fingers.

1936
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
MATT: "(giggles)"
TRAVIS: (giggles) Oh, stop it.

1937
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
LAURA: Little food bits fall out.

1938
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,500
SAM: I'm here to buy
just one quick thing in particular,

1939
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,000
then we'll be on our way.

1940
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
I just want a very tall hat.

1941
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Just very tall black hat 
with a point.

1942
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,760
MATT: "Tall.
Proportionally tall or regular?"

1943
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:03,000
SAM: Like a big triangle hat.

1944
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
MATT: "Hmm."

1945
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,000
SAM: With a wide brim.
Like a wide black hat just like this.

1946
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
MARISHA AND TRAVIS: (laugh)

1947
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
MATT: She thinks for a second.

1948
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
"I don't carry anything like that--"

1949
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,500
SAM: All right, well,
it was worth--

1950
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:20,000
MATT: "But I can make you something

1951
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,500
"if you don't mind waiting a bit."

1952
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,620
SAM: I could come back for it
another day, perhaps.

1953
01:30:23,620 --> 01:30:26,000
MATT: "Oh, but at least
let me measure your head, sweetie."

1954
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
SAM: It's not for me.

1955
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,000
MATT: "Do you know the size 
of who it's intended for?"

1956
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,720
SAM: Well, her head's
a little bigger than mine.

1957
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,000
MATT: "I'll make it adjustable!

1958
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
"You have to pay
half in advance, a custom order."

1959
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
SAM: Sure, how much?

1960
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
MATT: "That will be 10 gold now,

1961
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
"and an additional 10
upon retrieval."

1962
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,500
SAM: More than worth it.
I'll take it.

1963
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:52,000
MATT: "All right."

1964
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,500
SAM: And also,
can you get something for him

1965
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:55,470
that would really 
accentuate his features?

1966
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:57,270
TRAVIS: Me? What?
SAM: Yes, you need a hat.

1967
01:30:57,270 --> 01:31:00,500
TRAVIS: Oh, this streamlined.
This is how the look goes.

1968
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:02,000
SAM: But if it rains, Grog.

1969
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,000
TRAVIS: But that's part of it.
My muscles ripple in the moisture.

1970
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
MATT: "Nothing to block the muscles,
no, not at all,

1971
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
"but I have to say,
with a fine, smooth head,

1972
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,000
"it does need a little decoration,
if you don't mind me saying."

1973
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,500
TRAVIS: Oh. You think so?
MATT: "(chuckles) You!"

1974
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:18,000
SAM: Something
in a yarmulke, perhaps?

1975
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,500
MATT: "I was thinking--"

1976
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,000
And she whips out what looks like

1977
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,000
this fancy engraved leather cap
with two straps on the side

1978
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,500
and just (shoomf) right over your head.

1979
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:28,410
It kind of folds everything in,

1980
01:31:28,410 --> 01:31:30,000
the straps just go very long
and dangle there.

1981
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,500
LAURA AND ASHLEY: (laugh)
MARISHA: Yes! Yes!

1982
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:33,000
MATT: She takes them
and snaps them underneath

1983
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
to where these two little danglies
are dangling from under the chin.

1984
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,500
And it just has
these really intricate flower patterns

1985
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:40,500
punched into the leather all around.

1986
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,500
SAM: I love it, Grog.
I think you look great.

1987
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:44,000
TRAVIS: (stutters)
SAM: We don't have a mirror here?

1988
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,500
MATT: "I think it speaks
of the seasons."

1989
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,000
TRAVIS: Is it over my ears?

1990
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
MARISHA: Is it like one of those
old-school leather helmets?

1991
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,500
MATT: It looks almost
like the old football helmets.

1992
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:53,000
MARISHA: Oh, football!
Yeah. Okay! Cool.

1993
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,500
TRAVIS: I mean, I don't know,
does it do anything?

1994
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:57,380
MATT: "It looks masculine.
You wouldn't believe.

1995
01:31:57,380 --> 01:31:58,500
"Here, let me show you!"

1996
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:00,000
And she brings up a small mirror.

1997
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,500
TRAVIS: (screams)
(everyone else laughs)

1998
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:03,000
MATT: "Exactly.

1999
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
"Men will fear you
walking down the road."

2000
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,500
TRAVIS: No, please, more like--

2001
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:09,930
a bit more like war,
death, battlefield.

2002
01:32:09,930 --> 01:32:12,500
More aggressive.
This is a bit more like sheep-herder.

2003
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:16,000
TRAVIS: Here you go.
MATT: "Well, all right."

2004
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
MATT: "Death. Battle. Aggressive."
SAM: Maybe something with spikes?

2005
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:22,000
MATT: "Spikes. Spikes...
let me see what I can do."

2006
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
MARISHA, LAURA, AND ASHLEY: (laugh)

2007
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
MATT: And she runs off down the way,
gets into a bag

2008
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,000
and you start hearing things going
(tink, thud) something rolls over--

2009
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
"Ah, shit!"

2010
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Eventually she comes out.

2011
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,000
"This is less of a hat
and more of a half-helmet,

2012
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,730
"but maybe it'll do."

2013
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:41,020
And she pulls forth

2014
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:43,000
what looks like
this very wide metal brim,

2015
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,000
almost in a swish shape
to a point in the front.

2016
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,500
TRAVIS: (laughing) Conquistador's helmet?

2017
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:51,030
MATT: Yeah, it kind of looks
like a conquistador's helmet.

2018
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:53,000
But it's only the front,

2019
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,500
so it's almost like
a rhinoceros horn

2020
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,000
that sticks up to a point.

2021
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,500
MARISHA: Yes.
LAURA: Oh my god.

2022
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,000
MATT: And the rest buckles
to the back of the head,

2023
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
so it's a giant metallic groove
for the front.

2024
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,500
TRAVIS: I'll take it.
I don't even care if it fits.

2025
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,000
LIAM AND MARISHA: (laugh)

2026
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,590
MATT: "Oh, that's what I like to hear."

2027
01:33:06,590 --> 01:33:08,000
TRAVIS: How much is it?

2028
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,500
MATT: "This will be 50 gold."
LAURA: (gasps)

2029
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:12,000
TRAVIS: Is the point very sharp?

2030
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
MATT: "Try it yourself."

2031
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
TRAVIS: And I reach up
and I... hit it with my finger.

2032
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,500
MATT: It's all right.
It can be sharpened.

2033
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:20,000
It's more for decor.

2034
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
It's not meant
to slice somebody in half.

2035
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,000
TRAVIS: Yeah, it could be sharpened?

2036
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
MATT: "Well, I mean, what are you 
intending to do with this hat? (titters)"

2037
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,000
TRAVIS: Nothing, just look sharp.

2038
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
(groaning)

2039
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,000
MATT: "I can do that for you,
my big muscley man."

2040
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,840
LIAM: That is the very ceiling
of intelligence of his.

2041
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,050
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

2042
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:46,000
TRAVIS: Oh, see that sweet jam 
I just dropped there.

2043
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,500
SAM: I did, that was a good line.
TRAVIS: Write that in a notebook somewhere.

2044
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:52,000
TALIESIN: We'll be cleaning that
off the floor for ages.

2045
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
MATT: So after about five minutes or so,

2046
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,500
she grinds down
with what materials she has

2047
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:58,000
to a little more--

2048
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,540
it does mess with some of the polish
on the very tip of the metal,

2049
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:02,790
but it does come to a more solid point.

2050
01:34:02,790 --> 01:34:05,000
"Be careful with that."

2051
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,500
TRAVIS: So is it one piece
or is there a strap on the back

2052
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,000
or it just goes (foonk)?

2053
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
MATT: It goes on and then straps tight 
in the back to fit your head.

2054
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
TRAVIS: Beautiful.

2055
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,500
LAURA: It's basically like a unicorn?
MATT: Kind of.

2056
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:16,000
TRAVIS: Rhino.

2057
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
MATT: It's like a big old rhino horn
that curls upward to a point there.

2058
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
LIAM: Wow. Wow.
MATT: It looks a little ridiculous.

2059
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
MARISHA: I'm so excited for the art!

2060
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,000
TRAVIS: What do you think? Hold on.
What do you think?

2061
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
SAM: Wow.

2062
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,000
I mean, your silhouette
is magnificent. Imposing.

2063
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,500
LIAM: Is this
your variant fighting costume?

2064
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,000
ASHLEY: Oh, boy.
TRAVIS: Am I fearsome?

2065
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,500
SAM: You are. You are.

2066
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:37,000
We should go
to a silhouette artist after this

2067
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
and get something drawn for this.

2068
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
TRAVIS: They have those?
SAM: They do, they cut it out.

2069
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,940
TRAVIS: Milady, you are
a master of your trade.

2070
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:44,000
ASHLEY: Oh, boy.

2071
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
MATT: "Well. So they tell me."

2072
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:50,000
SAM: Our mom only gave us
60 gold to spend.

2073
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Could you give us both hats for 60?
We're brothers.

2074
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,660
(laughter)

2075
01:34:57,660 --> 01:35:01,000
SAM: Something 
went wrong with him at birth.

2076
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,710
MATT: Make a deception check
with disadvantage.

2077
01:35:03,710 --> 01:35:04,920
SAM: With disadvantage?!

2078
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:08,000
MATT: Yes.
LIAM: Doesn't matter.

2079
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,580
SAM: Well, would a 1 be bad?

2080
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:12,000
(laughter)

2081
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,500
MATT: Deidre goes,

2082
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:17,280
"(laughs) You silly, tiny man--

2083
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:20,000
"No, seriously. We have a price 
agreed upon. Pay it."

2084
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, I got it.
I got 50 gold of my own.

2085
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,660
SAM: All right. 20 from me, 
50 from him. We'll take them both.

2086
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:28,000
MATT: "Ooh, all up front? All right.
It'll be ready for you shortly."

2087
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,500
She takes the coin.

2088
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:31,160
"Thank you for the patronage.

2089
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:33,000
"Return here in about...
ooh, an hour,

2090
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,500
"and the hat
shall be prepared for you, sir--

2091
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:37,000
"what's your name?"

2092
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
SAM: My name's Scanlan Shorthalt.

2093
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,000
MATT: "Scanlan Shorthalt.
All right, come soon."

2094
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
SAM: See you soon.

2095
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
TRAVIS: Can I hit my head
on the doorway on the way out?

2096
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
MATT: (shoomp)
LAURA AND MARISHA: (laugh)

2097
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
MATT: (creak) You have to
kind of pull it out.

2098
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,500
Yeah. You leave a nice big groove.

2099
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:55,000
TRAVIS: It is nice, right?
MATT: Yeah.

2100
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,800
TRAVIS: Okay, good.

2101
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:00,500
MATT: (laughs) All right,
eventually you all gather again

2102
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:06,000
back at the hall of the Slayer's Take.

2103
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
You guys have just settled in

2104
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,190
and are free to continue
any discussion you like

2105
01:36:13,190 --> 01:36:19,000
as you see Scanlan and Grog come in.

2106
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,620
Say, you've since retrieved your hat

2107
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:26,000
with your various
wonderfully-crafted accoutrements.

2108
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
TRAVIS: 'Sup, bitches.
LAURA: Wow.

2109
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,500
SAM: Look at that.
ASHLEY: Whoa.

2110
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:32,000
TRAVIS: What happened?
SAM: Look at that.

2111
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
ASHLEY: (gasps) Ohh...
TRAVIS: I know, right? Wait for it.

2112
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
LIAM: (laughs)

2113
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:41,000
LAURA: Whoa. Grog, you're so monstrous.
ASHLEY: What? Grog, that is so scary.

2114
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,500
MARISHA: That's like
another 12 inches to you.

2115
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:44,000
TRAVIS: I know.
MARISHA: You look so tall.

2116
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,000
TRAVIS: It, like, changes
my whole battle strategy.

2117
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,450
I'm now literally
the point of the spear.

2118
01:36:49,450 --> 01:36:54,050
ASHLEY: (gasps) You're so scary.
TALIESIN: How have we lived with this idiot?

2119
01:36:54,050 --> 01:36:57,100
TRAVIS: (laughs) I'm a sea monster!
ASHLEY: (roars)

2120
01:36:57,100 --> 01:37:00,160
TRAVIS: I'm like
the most wicked narwhal of all time!

2121
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:02,600
Give me a pool! (laughs)

2122
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:05,000
ASHLEY: Can I try it on?
TRAVIS: Yeah, you want to?

2123
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
TRAVIS: (laughing)
I put it on Pike's head.

2124
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,830
ASHLEY: Whoa, it's so heavy.

2125
01:37:08,830 --> 01:37:11,790
(all but Taliesin laugh)
TALIESIN: What is the world coming to?

2126
01:37:11,790 --> 01:37:13,220
TRAVIS: Is it as tall as she is?

2127
01:37:13,220 --> 01:37:16,000
MATT: You can see
the bottom of her mouth.

2128
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
ASHLEY: Oh, Grog.

2129
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, look.

2130
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Wait, turn around 180 degrees
and then run as fast as you can.

2131
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, go!
Go! Go! Go, Pike! Go, go!

2132
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
LAURA: (clapping) Go, Pike!
Go, Pike! Go, Pike!

2133
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

2134
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:33,310
TALIESIN: (groans)
EVERYONE ELSE: (laughs)

2135
01:37:36,510 --> 01:37:38,000
ASHLEY: 9.

2136
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
MATT: 9. You go running
straight out of the door--

2137
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,500
LAURA: No!

2138
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:43,620
MATT: You guys are like,
"Oh. No, Pike!"

2139
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:46,000
She's already out the door,
over the stairs

2140
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
(repeated thuds),
outside of the hall.

2141
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,500
(sounds of dismay)

2142
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,500
TRAVIS and LAURA: Oh no!

2143
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,000
ASHLEY: I'm okay!

2144
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,500
MATT: You guys rush out to go catch her

2145
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:57,130
and the helmet is actually
embedded partway into the ground

2146
01:37:57,130 --> 01:37:58,770
and she's kind of--

2147
01:37:58,770 --> 01:38:00,000
MARISHA: Yeah!

2148
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,000
MATT: And she's just laughing.

2149
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
ASHLEY: (laughing) Grog,
get me out of this helmet.

2150
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
TRAVIS: I pick her up by the feet.

2151
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,470
TRAVIS: That was excellent. (giggles)

2152
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:13,850
ASHLEY: As he's holding me up like that
I try to stab him with it.

2153
01:38:15,710 --> 01:38:19,000
TRAVIS: I yank it off of her head
and put her back on the ground.

2154
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,230
LIAM: Vax has been
laughing hysterically,

2155
01:38:21,230 --> 01:38:24,000
giggle fits,
clutching his ribs the entire time.

2156
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,000
And then is there
any of the staff here?

2157
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Anyone that's here? Anyone else?

2158
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:33,000
MATT: You haven't seen Mertin.
Vanessa doesn't seem to have left.

2159
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,500
LIAM: What about underlings?

2160
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:36,000
MATT: I mean, there are

2161
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,500
a few individuals here
that are part of the guildhall.

2162
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:41,000
The hierarchy here
is more like the few that run it,

2163
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
and then everyone else
comes and goes as they please.

2164
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,580
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, come here, you.
Do you have a tub?

2165
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:48,660
Do you have a bath? Look at me.
Do you have a bath? I need a bath.

2166
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:50,000
MATT: "You look pretty rough."

2167
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
LIAM: Yeah?

2168
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,500
MATT: "Yeah. We could--

2169
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:54,720
"we got a washroom in the back,
if you need it."

2170
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:58,000
LIAM: Is it hot?
I feel like I need it to be hot.

2171
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
MATT: "You get what you get. 
It's water, buddy."

2172
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,500
LIAM: Okay.
That's perfect, thank you.

2173
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:03,000
Grog, put that hat on again.

2174
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:08,000
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, hold on. (foomp)
LIAM: (laughs hysterically)

2175
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,500
LIAM: All the way down the hall
to take a bath.

2176
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:11,000
SAM: It's crazy. Did you guys
get him drunk or something?

2177
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,500
TALIESIN: I don't know
what you people did, but...

2178
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:14,000
ASHLEY: Well, he just...

2179
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,500
TRAVIS: People respond to fear differently.

2180
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:17,000
SAM: I guess so.
LAURA: He's gone insane.

2181
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,500
MARISHA: He might have saw
the face of a god.

2182
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:21,920
SAM: Whatever.
TRAVIS: He did?

2183
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:23,470
MARISHA: Yeah.

2184
01:39:23,470 --> 01:39:25,500
ASHLEY: Yeah. The head of--

2185
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:28,000
TRAVIS: By the way,
why is he covered in bloodbath?

2186
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
ASHLEY: I think that was part of the--

2187
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
MARISHA: Ritual? Communion?

2188
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
ASHLEY: Getting to know his new god.

2189
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
TRAVIS: Did he kill a lot of people?

2190
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,500
ASHLEY: Maybe he had to. I don't know.

2191
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:40,000
TRAVIS: He did?
LAURA: So many, Grog.

2192
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,500
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
LAURA: Yeah. It was a giant battle.

2193
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:44,300
TRAVIS: Like, how many on two hands?

2194
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:47,140
LAURA: Like at least this many.

2195
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:51,000
TRAVIS: That's a legendary amount.
LAURA: That's more than six.

2196
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,200
LAURA: I know.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2197
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:55,000
LIAM: Somewhere deep in the building,
far away:

2198
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:00,000
LIAM: This is not hot!

2199
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
MATT: The gruff individual chuckles.

2200
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,000
"Heh. It never is."

2201
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,000
I need you to make a tinkering check.

2202
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
TALIESIN: Okay.

2203
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,000
I'm sitting with my tea and my tools,
trying to ignore these people.

2204
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,060
LAURA: Can I heat water up
in the fireplace?

2205
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:16,620
MATT: Yeah, yeah,
it'll take you a little while.

2206
01:40:16,620 --> 01:40:19,000
TALIESIN: Please don't explode.

2207
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
SAM: When I delivered
the materials to him--

2208
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
TALIESIN: Oh, Jesus H. Fucking Christ.
MARISHA: Oh no, Taliesin...

2209
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
SAM: Could I have inspired him at all,
when I delivered the materials?

2210
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,500
TALIESIN: Please.
MATT: Sure.

2211
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:30,000
SAM: All right.
MARISHA: Please inspire.

2212
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,320
SAM: I will inspire--
oh my god, it's not even worth it.

2213
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:36,750
TALIESIN: (muffled) Please inspire.
Do it. Do it, you bloody gnome!

2214
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:38,460
SAM: Okay.
So when I delivered everything,

2215
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:42,000
I just sang him a little song
to inspire him. And I sang,

2216
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,000
SAM: (singing) 
Percy's gun, won't you come

2217
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,630
and kill up all the dragons?

2218
01:40:49,630 --> 01:40:55,500
(others join in) Percy's gun,
won't you come, won't you come?

2219
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:57,000
ASHLEY AND LIAM: Percy's gun!

2220
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
(laughter)

2221
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
MATT: Oh my god.
All right, take your d10.

2222
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,500
LAURA: Ten! Ten! Ten!
LIAM: Do it! Do it!

2223
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:04,000
MARISHA: Oh my god, it's a 10!
TALIESIN: Better!

2224
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,500
SAM: That was a 10.
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2225
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:07,000
MARISHA: I get excited. Sorry.
LIAM: Pretty good song.

2226
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,500
TALIESIN: Proficiency,
tinkering, plus the--

2227
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:11,000
MATT: Well, your proficiency
is what you get with the roll

2228
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
and then it's your dex bonus.

2229
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:17,000
TALIESIN: Okay, so proficiency,
dex, okay, thank you, god.

2230
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
TALIESIN: (muttering) That's 11...
LIAM: (hums Black Hole Sun)

2231
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
TALIESIN: 23.
MATT: 23. What did you roll naturally?

2232
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,500
SAM: A 2.
TALIESIN: 2.

2233
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:24,000
LIAM: (laughs)
LAURA: Whoa.

2234
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,860
SAM: Plus 10.
MATT: Ah.

2235
01:41:25,860 --> 01:41:27,000
TALIESIN AND MARISHA: Plus 10.

2236
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
TALIESIN: Made it 12.
MATT: Wow. All righty.

2237
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
TALIESIN: It's not complicated,
but I've got a good design,

2238
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,000
and it has two nifty things.

2239
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,500
MATT: What are the nifty things?

2240
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:37,000
SAM: Fingers.

2241
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,500
TALIESIN: It doesn't actually
have fingers.

2242
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:42,000
It's a mitt piece, strap-on,

2243
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
it can lock the thumb
and lock the hand

2244
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
so you can open it, lock,
close it, lock.

2245
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
It's got little flip-locks.

2246
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,000
MATT: Mm-hm.

2247
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
TALIESIN: You can detach the hand

2248
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,690
and put a pick spike on
for mining. Like a mining punch.

2249
01:41:54,690 --> 01:41:56,320
LIAM: Is it like Young Frankenstein?

2250
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:58,000
(mechanical sound effects)

2251
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,500
TALIESIN: It's more Dustin Hoffman "Hook",
but, you know.

2252
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:04,000
MARISHA: Oh, sure.
LAURA: Oh, that's nice.

2253
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,500
MARISHA: I was thinking
Go-Go-Gadget Finger.

2254
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:07,000
TALIESIN: Because it's got
the click, pull, click.

2255
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:10,000
MATT: Right.

2256
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,500
TALIESIN: I can do it
with all these things.

2257
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:13,000
I can graph it. So.

2258
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
MATT: (laughs)

2259
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
TALIESIN: Reasonable.
It's not pretty.

2260
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,500
MATT: It takes you a few hours

2261
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:19,000
and gets you into
the early parts of the evening,

2262
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:25,000
but you do manage
to go ahead and complete it.

2263
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,000
You manage to get it finished up

2264
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,000
and you're pretty proud of your work,
actually, and you feel--

2265
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,450
the whistle you're still doing
as you do the final bits,

2266
01:42:33,450 --> 01:42:35,000
you realize is the song
that Scanlan sang for you,

2267
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,500
just looping in your head.

2268
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:38,000
It happened to push you
through your work

2269
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,500
and get your final piece completed.

2270
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:42,320
TALIESIN: I also carved
a little message inside

2271
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:45,000
that will not matter
unless it actually becomes pertinent.

2272
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,000
MATT: Okay.

2273
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,780
TALIESIN: You don't get to know
until you ask offscreen.

2274
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:50,970
SAM: You don't know.
LAURA: (laughs) Ohhh.

2275
01:42:50,970 --> 01:42:52,170
MATT: Okay. I'm excited. Okay.

2276
01:42:52,170 --> 01:42:53,820
MARISHA: That's right, DM.
TRAVIS: That never happens.

2277
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:58,100
MATT: (laughs) Try me. Okay.
Do you go and deliver it?

2278
01:42:58,100 --> 01:42:59,920
TALIESIN: I do go and deliver it.

2279
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:03,000
MATT: Okay.
As the sun begins to set in Vasselheim,

2280
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,910
you make your way back over
to the Braving Grounds,

2281
01:43:05,910 --> 01:43:11,000
which as you look across, too,
as the night goes dark,

2282
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,420
the Braving Grounds itself
has a whole different life to it.

2283
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:18,020
There are so many forges
and smelters going that there's--

2284
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:20,200
most buildings have
this bright orange glow

2285
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:22,190
through the ceiling
and these various openings

2286
01:43:22,190 --> 01:43:25,000
where fumes and smoke and exhaust
are sent up

2287
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:29,000
from the various
production constructs and such.

2288
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,000
It has this very luminescent look
in comparison to a lot of the city.

2289
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,190
It's very interesting.

2290
01:43:33,190 --> 01:43:36,000
It reminds you of the deep,
deep portions of Kraghammer,

2291
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:41,000
where most of
the actual fire and melted rock

2292
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:45,000
was being smelted
and gathered and heated.

2293
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
So you make your way to the hovel.

2294
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:50,410
The roof workers are no longer there,
and the door is closed.

2295
01:43:53,380 --> 01:43:58,000
TALIESIN: (knocks) Victor?
I've got your hand.

2296
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:02,000
MATT: "(muffled) I'm sleeping."

2297
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
TALIESIN: Do you want your hand?

2298
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
MATT: "(muffled) You want me to sleep?"

2299
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,270
TALIESIN: I don't see why
they're mutually exclusive.

2300
01:44:10,270 --> 01:44:12,000
MARISHA: (laughs)

2301
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
MATT: You hear (scraping sound)
a bunch of different locks fiddling.

2302
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
(series of clicks) (fwoosh)

2303
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
And the door opens
and you see Victor,

2304
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
clean-faced for the first time
you've really seen him before,

2305
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
and he has a nightcap

2306
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,500
which sort of (foomf)
in front of his face,

2307
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:25,000
with a little puffball at the end.

2308
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,000
He's like,

2309
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,010
"I told you.
I was trying-- oh! Hey.

2310
01:44:29,010 --> 01:44:32,000
"(hesitantly) Percival?"

2311
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,590
TALIESIN: Yes, that's quite good.
I love your hat.

2312
01:44:34,590 --> 01:44:36,500
MATT: "Thank you.
It's comfy to sleep in."

2313
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:38,330
TALIESIN: It looks it.
MATT: "Did you bring my hand?"

2314
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:40,860
TALIESIN: I did. I grabbed your hand
and I will show you.

2315
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:42,190
It is very special.

2316
01:44:42,190 --> 01:44:43,500
MATT: "Come in! Come in! (grunts)"

2317
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:45,000
And opens the door.

2318
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,500
You see he's wearing
this long nightgown

2319
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:48,000
that is covered in patches
and tears in it.

2320
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Most of it
has been turned black through soot,

2321
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
but the cap is perfect.
Perfect condition.

2322
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,500
TALIESIN: I have a special
set of pajamas myself, so I understand.

2323
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:57,000
MATT: "They are comfortable."

2324
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:01,000
As he walks in,
still bandaged on the arm,

2325
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
you can see there's

2326
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:06,000
a small kettle of tea
set by the small fireplace right there.

2327
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,530
It's a tiny little table
and a tiny little stool

2328
01:45:08,530 --> 01:45:11,000
that he's just kind of
sitting on right there.

2329
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,490
And he goes
and he reaches over for the kettle.

2330
01:45:13,490 --> 01:45:15,370
"(groans)"

2331
01:45:17,690 --> 01:45:19,640
Tries to pick up the cup
and just pours the tea into it.

2332
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:20,650
TALIESIN: (alarmed stuttering)

2333
01:45:20,650 --> 01:45:23,900
TALIESIN: I'm going to stop
and attach and begin strapping this.

2334
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:25,000
MATT: "(confused stuttering)"

2335
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
TALIESIN: Let me show you. 
It attaches like this.

2336
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,000
MATT: "Ooh."

2337
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
TALIESIN: Here are the two switches.
(clicking)

2338
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:34,000
And for your mine.

2339
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
MATT: "Eh? Oh."

2340
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,500
TALIESIN: I grab,
hit the button, twist, pull.

2341
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:39,680
MATT: "Oh? Eh? I just got that!"

2342
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:43,000
TALIESIN: And I get the spike
and attach it.

2343
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,000
MATT: "Oh."

2344
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
TALIESIN: Remove it,
put the hand back on.

2345
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Tea?

2346
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,990
MATT: (chuckle, click)

2347
01:45:52,990 --> 01:45:58,000
(excited laughter) "Tea?"

2348
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,000
TALIESIN: Sure. Why not?
Always say yes.

2349
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:04,000
MARISHA: (laughs)

2350
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,500
MATT: "Need another cup. (grunts)"

2351
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,000
He stands up and goes over,

2352
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,500
still holding the kettle
and splashing everywhere,

2353
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:11,000
and he's flipping through cabinets
and knocking pieces of glass out.

2354
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
"Ah! Found it."

2355
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Pulls out another little ceramic cup

2356
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:22,000
and pours the tea in,
sets it down. (chink, click)

2357
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
"(cackles)"

2358
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,000
SAM: (laughs)

2359
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:30,000
MATT: "To new hands!"
TALIESIN: To new hands.

2360
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
SAM: That's a great toast.

2361
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,000
MATT: It is pungent. It is bitter.

2362
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,000
MATT: It has been steeped way too long.
ASHLEY: Gunpowder tea.

2363
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,000
MATT: But it definitely
cleans out the sinuses.

2364
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,290
And there is a hint of gunpowder
to the flavoring.

2365
01:46:44,290 --> 01:46:46,500
You get the sense
that pretty much everything in this room

2366
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:48,000
is marinated in some way,
shape, or form

2367
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,500
to be flammable.

2368
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:52,000
TALIESIN: (hoarsely) Victor.

2369
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
(laughter)

2370
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
MATT: "It can put hair on your balls."

2371
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:00,000
TALIESIN: Ohhh, probably.

2372
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Has a woman been by
to buy black powder?

2373
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:09,000
(coughs) Has a woman been by?

2374
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:12,500
MATT: "Not in, uh, weeks, maybe."

2375
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:14,000
TALIESIN: Weeks?

2376
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,500
MATT: "Did you make her hand, too?"

2377
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:20,000
TALIESIN: I did not.
Do you know where she goes?

2378
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,470
MATT: "No. She paid well, though."

2379
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:24,000
TALIESIN: Did she? What did she pay?

2380
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,000
MATT: "Are you guys in a club now?
How many people want black powder?

2381
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
"Tell me! Tell them!
Bring them more.

2382
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,500
"I could use money."

2383
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:36,000
(others laugh)

2384
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:44,000
TALIESIN: How much black powder
did she buy, Victor?

2385
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:50,000
MATT: "Uh... (mutters to himself)"
(click, click)

2386
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
TALIESIN: Only counts to two.
I'm so sorry.

2387
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,000
(laughter)

2388
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:00,970
MATT: "Maybe... 12 hogsheads worth?"

2389
01:48:00,970 --> 01:48:02,780
ASHLEY: Whoa.
TRAVIS AND MARISHA: Oh, shit.

2390
01:48:02,780 --> 01:48:07,000
TALIESIN: Really?
And how often does she come by?

2391
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
MATT: "She only come by once."

2392
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:12,000
TALIESIN: Okay. (sighs)

2393
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Thank you. I'm so pleased.

2394
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,310
I may stop by one last time
before I leave town,

2395
01:48:20,310 --> 01:48:22,000
just to say goodbye. Thank you.

2396
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
MATT: "Please do! I have more tea.

2397
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:30,000
"Many different flavors.
This is, I call, dark roast."

2398
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:34,000
TALIESIN: It...
certainly scalded something.

2399
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Thank you. That was very lovely
and that was very charming

2400
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
and I unfortunately have business in the--

2401
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
MATT: "I want to try the other one
before you go."

2402
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
TALIESIN: One more
and then I must go, thank you.

2403
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,000
MATT: "(click, creak)
Come on, need this, too."

2404
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:52,000
TALIESIN: Yes, of course.
MATT: "(creak, click) (cackles)"

2405
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,000
TALIESIN: (uncertain laughter)

2406
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:59,000
MATT: (thunk) He sticks it 
into the wooden stool and the table.

2407
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Kind of breaks the wood
and snaps it.

2408
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,000
"Oh. (cackles)"

2409
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,000
TALIESIN: Remember
that it's attached to bone.

2410
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:12,000
You can still break your arm,
so be gentle.

2411
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,500
MATT: "Yes. Thank you!"

2412
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:15,000
TALIESIN: Thank you. Good night!
Have a lovely evening.

2413
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,260
MATT: "Good night!"
SAM: Aah.

2414
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:20,500
TALIESIN: Good night.
Aah. Pleasure, as always.

2415
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:22,000
Thank you.

2416
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,000
MATT: "(slurps)"

2417
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,500
TALIESIN: I leave
in a little bit of a panic.

2418
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:27,000
MATT: You leave
and he's just sitting there

2419
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
staring
at this long chisel point, going,

2420
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:33,000
"(quiet cackling)"

2421
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,680
SAM: His ring.
MARISHA: (laughs)

2422
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:38,000
MATT: The door
slowly closes behind you.

2423
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,500
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LIAM: A fighter is born.

2424
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:41,560
MARISHA: Yes, yeah,
just give him an anime weapon.

2425
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:45,000
TALIESIN: Yeah, okay.
We're sticking around for a day?

2426
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,500
SAM: I assume so. I don't know.

2427
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:49,000
We're going to spend the night,
at least.

2428
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:52,000
TALIESIN: I'm going to take
a long walk before I come back

2429
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
and I'm going to walk by
the Raven Queen temple

2430
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:58,000
and just... peek inside.

2431
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:02,000
MATT: Okay.
You make your way past the Quad Roads.

2432
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:06,330
At this point at night
the whole clientele has shifted.

2433
01:50:06,330 --> 01:50:09,300
Most people coming here--
you hear laughter, you hear music.

2434
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:15,000
The Quad Roads is the New Orleans 
of the town, comparatively.

2435
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
It's still nowhere near as rambunctious
as many places you've been,

2436
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
but for what seems during the day

2437
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:23,000
to be a rather dour
and serious business type city,

2438
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
the Quad Roads
is where the celebration of humanity hits

2439
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,500
when the evening hours hit.

2440
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:28,000
So you come by

2441
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
and there's some taverns
that are open.

2442
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:34,000
You see, to a certain extent,

2443
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:38,000
what even appears to be
an adult entertainment district.

2444
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
LAURA: (laughs sarcastically)

2445
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,500
MATT: You make your way beyond--

2446
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:43,400
LIAM: (clears throat)
Ring-a-ding-ding.

2447
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:46,000
MATT: It's the oldest profession.

2448
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,000
You make your way all the way
to the outskirts of the Duskmeadow,

2449
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
and there, amongst the

2450
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:55,000
just barely peeking
through the cloudline starlight,

2451
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:00,000
the looming dark structure
that is Raven's Crest.

2452
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,000
TALIESIN: I'm just going to
gently open the door

2453
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,470
and peek inside
and see if anybody's inside.

2454
01:51:05,470 --> 01:51:12,000
MATT: Okay. You go ahead
and push the door open. (creak)

2455
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,240
Doesn't appear to be anybody there.

2456
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:24,000
TALIESIN: I walk in just for a moment
and take a look around.

2457
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:28,000
MATT: Okay. You walk in.
(clicking footsteps)

2458
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:33,000
At this dark hour, looking around,
the obsidian-type walls

2459
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
are translucent glass
on the other side,

2460
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,500
though you can barely make out
through the material

2461
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:38,000
the details of the outside world,

2462
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,290
due to the lack of light
across the cityscape.

2463
01:51:40,290 --> 01:51:41,700
Especially here in Duskmeadow,

2464
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:46,000
in which the magical lantern light
that illuminates the city streets

2465
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,940
are relatively sparse
on this side of Vasselheim.

2466
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:55,000
You take a few more steps in,
(clicking footsteps)

2467
01:51:55,000 --> 01:52:00,000
footsteps echoing across the long,
thin, dark material of the floors.

2468
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
(creak, thud)

2469
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
LAURA: (gasps)
MATT: Door closes behind you.

2470
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:08,000
TRAVIS: (quietly) What would--
why would you do this?

2471
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,000
LIAM: Said the T. rex.

2472
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
TALIESIN: I'm going to
gently look around

2473
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:18,000
and slowly back up
and see if I can see anyone.

2474
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:24,000
TALIESIN: Hello? Hello?

2475
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:28,000
MATT: (echoing) Hello...
hello... hello.

2476
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
TALIESIN: What do I have to pay
to fix this?

2477
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:46,213
MATT: (echoing) This...
this... this... this.

2478
01:52:52,453 --> 01:52:53,786
TALIESIN: I leave.

2479
01:52:53,786 --> 01:52:55,750
MATT: (thump-crash)
You hear the sound

2480
01:52:55,750 --> 01:52:58,000
of some sort of low,
distant hit and a rumble,

2481
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:02,500
and you see a distant light appear
in a chamber just beyond the walkway,

2482
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:04,000
just faint enough to illuminate

2483
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,000
and give the presence
of some sort of life or movement

2484
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,000
about a hundred or so feet ahead of you.

2485
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
TALIESIN: I walk briskly towards it.

2486
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,500
MATT: You enter the next chamber,

2487
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:21,000
where you see the interior
of this structure

2488
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:26,500
is ivory-white bone and glass,
with a blue hint,

2489
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:28,000
very much resembling the interior

2490
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:34,000
of a very naturally,
beautifully-carved ice cavern.

2491
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,500
There is a stairway that ascends,

2492
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:37,000
as well as other hallways
that lead out

2493
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
from the central nerve center

2494
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:43,000
of the lower floor
of the main structure.

2495
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:46,000
As you walk into this central chamber,

2496
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,000
you see, ever so faintly,
at the very top of the stairs,

2497
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:53,000
a pair of feet (footsteps)
walk and disappear up the stairs.

2498
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
TALIESIN: I'm going to 
charge after them.

2499
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,960
MATT: Okay. You go running
up the stairway. (thud thud)

2500
01:53:56,960 --> 01:54:00,000
You get to the top, and you can see
at the very top of the stairs

2501
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:04,210
a dark wooden door
with a dark iron rim

2502
01:54:04,210 --> 01:54:05,480
and what appears to be

2503
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:09,610
a large hanger or handle
or knocker bolted to it

2504
01:54:09,610 --> 01:54:12,000
and it (thud) just closes

2505
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:17,000
as you come underneath
the top of the archway and up the stairs.

2506
01:54:23,780 --> 01:54:25,000
TALIESIN: I knock.

2507
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:29,000
MATT: (doosh) Once?

2508
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
TALIESIN: Three times.

2509
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
MATT: (doosh doosh)
With each hit,

2510
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:36,000
you can hear the reverberation
of the echo of the knock

2511
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,000
through a much larger chamber beyond.

2512
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:44,000
As soon as you release
the actual door knocker,

2513
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:50,000
the door (thump-crash, creak)

2514
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:55,000
just creaks open ever so slightly
into a very, very dark chamber.

2515
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:59,000
You can see very, very little in here,
other than the basic outline

2516
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:03,000
of what looks to be
a little bit of floor,

2517
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,500
some sort of a smooth,
glassy surface

2518
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:07,000
that refracts
just a little bit of light

2519
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
that makes it through
what looks to be

2520
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:14,000
some sort of broken-up
glass dome-type structure above you.

2521
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:17,850
You can't make out much beyond that.
It's very dark in here.

2522
01:55:19,890 --> 01:55:26,260
TALIESIN: Hello? Please. (sighs)

2523
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:30,000
Something terrible has happened.

2524
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,500
I don't understand how these games work.

2525
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:36,000
I need help to fix something.

2526
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Something terrible has happened!

2527
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,500
You obviously
care little for this world.

2528
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:56,000
I start to back out.

2529
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,560
MATT: As you step out of the room,
you hear a whisper

2530
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:03,000
come from beyond the chamber,
within the darkness. It says,

2531
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:07,000
"Is it yourself
you wish to fix or something more?"

2532
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:13,640
TALIESIN: I don't think I can be fixed.

2533
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:16,000
There is something broken in the world.

2534
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
MATT: "Then come. Let us talk."

2535
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,760
TALIESIN: ...I don't understand
how these things work.

2536
01:56:27,760 --> 01:56:33,000
I'm so sorry. 
Where do you wish me to go?

2537
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,500
MATT: "Have faith."

2538
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:37,000
TALIESIN: (disbelieving laugh)

2539
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:40,000
MATT: "Step in. Join me."

2540
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:47,000
TALIESIN: (sighs) ...I strip.

2541
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
TRAVIS: (gasps)

2542
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
TALIESIN: And put it aside.

2543
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,000
SAM: Put "it" aside?

2544
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,500
TALIESIN: Put my clothes
in the corner.

2545
01:56:53,500 --> 01:56:55,000
SAM: Oh.
You're gonna jump her, eh?

2546
01:56:55,000 --> 01:57:00,000
TALIESIN: You're filthy.
And I go into the pool.

2547
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
MATT: All right.

2548
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:06,500
As you step into the chamber,
freezing cold as your toes--

2549
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:08,000
TALIESIN: We're cold people.

2550
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,480
MATT: Your legs, your whole body
eventually finds itself

2551
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:18,000
stepping into this thick,
freezing liquid.

2552
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
You hear the whisper in your ears

2553
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
just as your head
reaches the level of the blood,

2554
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,520
that says,

2555
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:31,760
"Come. Come to me with your questions."

2556
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Just as your head goes
beneath the surface.

2557
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,000
TALIESIN: (sighs) We're doing this.

2558
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:45,000
MATT: You're underneath
and in darkness,

2559
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
feeling around the thick material,

2560
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,000
kind of just
swishing your fingers around,

2561
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,500
but amongst the liquid,

2562
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:55,000
you still hear the whisper again
in your ear:

2563
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:59,000
"Come. Bring your questions."

2564
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:04,000
TALIESIN: And I swim down
until it's uncomfortable.

2565
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:08,740
MATT: You swim downward
and you touch the bottom of the pool.

2566
01:58:08,740 --> 01:58:13,880
You reach a somewhat concave,

2567
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:16,630
smooth floor to the pool.

2568
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
TALIESIN: I'm going to
head to the surface.

2569
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,500
I don't know what's...

2570
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:26,000
MATT: You head to the surface.

2571
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
There's no surface.
It just keeps going.

2572
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:32,000
TALIESIN: (sighs)
I do not do well with this.

2573
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:35,000
MATT: You do not.
You begin to panic.

2574
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,500
TALIESIN: Yes, I do.

2575
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:38,000
MATT: You begin to reach around

2576
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:39,500
and try to swim up
and find the surface,

2577
01:58:39,500 --> 01:58:40,500
but it just keeps going.

2578
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:42,000
The liquid's thick
and it's hard to pull through,

2579
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,500
and you can't open your eyes,
and you can't see anything,

2580
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:45,000
and the iron-like flavor

2581
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:48,000
is starting to find its way
to the inside of your mouth

2582
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:52,000
as it's seeping through your nose
and your ears.

2583
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:55,000
You begin to panic even further
as the cold is starting to take

2584
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
and you feel your muscles
beginning to shake and seize

2585
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
from the onset of hypothermia.

2586
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
You begin to head
to the bottom of the pool again,

2587
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,620
and this time,
you crack your head on the bottom

2588
01:59:03,620 --> 01:59:06,420
in the middle of your stupor,
and you reach up and scream in pain.

2589
01:59:06,420 --> 01:59:10,010
As you do, the blood fills your lungs
and you begin to feel yourself drown.

2590
01:59:10,010 --> 01:59:11,500
You begin to shake and convulse

2591
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:13,000
as you begin to try to find a way
to force it out of your body

2592
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
and you can't.

2593
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,000
And at that moment,

2594
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:19,000
where all of a sudden
you realize that this is it.

2595
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,700
This is the end.

2596
01:59:20,700 --> 01:59:24,460
This is how the tale of Percival
comes to an end.

2597
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:29,000
The sensation goes warm again.

2598
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:33,000
And it's like all that cold energy
goes away,

2599
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:37,000
and you're now swimming in water,
then air,

2600
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:42,000
and the pain subsides,
and you're breathing normally.

2601
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:46,000
But you still stand in darkness,
and you hear these distant footsteps.

2602
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:50,000
(clicking footsteps) Sourceless.

2603
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:54,000
No light, just shadow.

2604
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,500
And you look around 
over your shoulder

2605
01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:57,000
and then right behind you,
you see immediately

2606
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
a white porcelain face,

2607
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:04,000
the head is just standing there
amongst the shadow.

2608
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
TALIESIN: (takes deep breaths)
Do you know what I've done?

2609
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:12,000
MATT: "I've watched."

2610
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:20,000
TALIESIN: I have questions.

2611
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
MATT: "Then ask them."

2612
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:31,450
TALIESIN: First is, can we stop it?

2613
02:00:31,450 --> 02:00:35,000
Can we stop what's been released?

2614
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Is there something I can do?

2615
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:40,000
MATT: "Many things
are released in this world.

2616
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:44,980
"Many terrible, many wonderful.
Many things.

2617
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
"Ask the right questions."

2618
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,550
TALIESIN: Did it choose me
because I was broken,

2619
02:00:57,550 --> 02:00:58,980
or did it break me?

2620
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:04,960
MATT: The mask, which has not shown
any expression at this point,

2621
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:09,000
pulls back a little bit from you
and almost seems to grow in size.

2622
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
It's strange;

2623
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:14,000
the proportion seems to stay the same,
but suddenly your vision shifts

2624
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,000
and you realize, no,

2625
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:19,000
it's farther away from you
and is just suddenly immense,

2626
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
like your visual focus just changes

2627
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
and your whole perspective
suddenly causes you

2628
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:26,000
to lose sense of scale and balance.

2629
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:30,000
The voice comes in,
this time louder:

2630
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:34,000
"You were always broken, Percival.

2631
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:40,000
"And you were preyed upon,
just as it preys upon others,

2632
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:43,000
"and will continue to do so
until finally destroyed."

2633
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:50,000
TALIESIN: Can it be fixed?

2634
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
MATT: "Perhaps.

2635
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:58,000
"Your deeds will guide your path
to salvation or damnation.

2636
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,000
"The choice is yours.
You skirt that line still."

2637
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:06,000
TALIESIN: But the first deed is so...

2638
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:12,000
there's so much,
and I don't think any of them see it.

2639
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:19,000
I want it to die
before anybody sees it.

2640
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Can you help?

2641
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,520
MATT: "I've already helped, Percival.

2642
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
"Do not think the path
that you and your allies walk

2643
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:31,000
"goes unseen.

2644
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:37,000
"There are many of those in this world
that represent the will of us,

2645
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:40,000
"just as there are those
who represent the will

2646
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:44,000
"of those that combat us
and always have.

2647
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:50,000
"There are a great many deeds
ahead of you.

2648
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:53,000
"It's your choice to take them.

2649
02:02:53,000 --> 02:03:00,000
"Just know:
should you not watch yourself,

2650
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,000
"you may not find yourself
on our side."

2651
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,000
TALIESIN: I know.

2652
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:15,460
There is nowhere 
I can look for healing?

2653
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:18,840
Other than deeds?

2654
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,560
I like to fix things.

2655
02:03:26,580 --> 02:03:29,530
MATT: "All life is inherently 
broken from the start, Percival.

2656
02:03:29,530 --> 02:03:32,110
"Take solace in that.

2657
02:03:32,110 --> 02:03:35,000
"There is no perfection in life.

2658
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:38,290
"Otherwise, what would be 
the purpose of death?

2659
02:03:39,980 --> 02:03:43,000
"It's to try to find ways
to better yourself before the end

2660
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,110
"that gives us purpose.

2661
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:52,180
"You are all broken,
but also understand,"

2662
02:03:52,180 --> 02:03:57,000
At this point, her voice 
gets very deep and very resonant.

2663
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:00,000
"Mortals can achieve great things.

2664
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,000
"I did."

2665
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
And the mask pulls back
into the shadows

2666
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,500
and suddenly (gasp, cough)

2667
02:04:07,500 --> 02:04:10,170
you begin coughing,
finding your way to the surface,

2668
02:04:10,170 --> 02:04:13,000
pouring blood out of your mouth
and coughing

2669
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
and eventually you find your way over,
breathing heavily,

2670
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:18,000
to the side of the pool and (grunt)
pull yourself onto the side.

2671
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,500
(cough) Cough the rest of it up.

2672
02:04:19,500 --> 02:04:22,090
A little bit of moonlight peeks through,
and you can see

2673
02:04:22,090 --> 02:04:26,000
the beams refracting through
the purples and reds and blues

2674
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,930
and just hints of specks of light

2675
02:04:29,930 --> 02:04:31,540
that just shimmer
across the surface

2676
02:04:31,540 --> 02:04:33,450
of this dark,
glass-like floor.

2677
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:42,000
TALIESIN: I'm going to take my sword

2678
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:46,000
and I'm going to very carefully
scrape my body clean of the blood,

2679
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:49,000
as much as I can,

2680
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:52,000
and I'm going to take
the back of my shirt

2681
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:56,000
and clean my hair off
as much as I can.

2682
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:00,000
I'm going to take
a vial of the blood in the pool.

2683
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:03,000
One tiny bit.

2684
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:04,440
MATT: You do so.

2685
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:07,220
TALIESIN: I'm going to
put my clothes back on...

2686
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:16,000
and I'm going to cast Hex on myself
for my walk home

2687
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:19,000
and banish it
before I come in the door.

2688
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:25,000
MATT: Okay. All righty.

2689
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:29,000
So, as Percival finally wanders in,

2690
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,000
is there anything else
anyone wants to achieve

2691
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,000
before the evening's done?

2692
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:32,500
SAM: I'd like to go to the Raven Queen.

2693
02:05:32,500 --> 02:05:37,000
(laughter)

2694
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:38,000
SAM: No.

2695
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:39,000
LIAM: Are we next morning,

2696
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,500
or we're still evening,
at this point?

2697
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:42,000
MATT: We're still evening 
at the moment,

2698
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,500
if there's anything else
you wish to achieve. Otherwise--

2699
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:44,500
LAURA: I've been slowly heating water

2700
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:46,000
and giving it to Vax
to put in his bath.

2701
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:47,140
MATT: You do manage

2702
02:05:47,140 --> 02:05:50,220
to draw a comfortable bath
for your brother and wash him clean.

2703
02:05:50,220 --> 02:05:52,030
LAURA: I don't wash him!

2704
02:05:52,030 --> 02:05:54,000
I just give him the fucking water.

2705
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:55,500
MATT: You aid him in washing 
himself clean. So you specify.

2706
02:05:55,500 --> 02:05:59,000
LIAM: Thanks, man.

2707
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,500
TRAVIS: Do we see Percy
when he comes in?

2708
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:03,000
MATT: It's going to be late.

2709
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:04,500
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk quiet and late

2710
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:06,000
and go tinker
on a little thing for a minute

2711
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
until I pass out.

2712
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
MATT: Okay.
You do notice Percy enter.

2713
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Looks a little frazzled,
but doesn't seem to--

2714
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:15,530
LAURA: Do I see any of the blood?
Passive perception?

2715
02:06:15,530 --> 02:06:17,000
LIAM: You're in 
the tubby town, though.

2716
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:18,790
MATT: Make a perception check.

2717
02:06:18,790 --> 02:06:22,330
I want you to make 
a dexterity check.

2718
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
MARISHA AND TALIESIN: (groan)

2719
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
LIAM: Sorry, Taliesin.

2720
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
SAM: You've got him.

2721
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:32,740
LIAM: Rolled high.
LAURA: 32.

2722
02:06:32,740 --> 02:06:34,120
TALIESIN: 32?!

2723
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:36,730
Oh my god, what the--
I couldn't have rolled that.

2724
02:06:36,730 --> 02:06:38,300
Like, that would've been 
a natural 20,

2725
02:06:38,300 --> 02:06:40,000
would have been 
the only way around that.

2726
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:43,000
MATT: You see, just faintly 
behind one of his ears

2727
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:47,000
and at the edge of his collar
on his coat,

2728
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:54,000
just a bit of familiar crimson,
and a look of...

2729
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
a distant stare that is familiar.

2730
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:03,660
MATT: All right.

2731
02:07:03,660 --> 02:07:05,500
Do you all wish to rest
for the evening?

2732
02:07:05,500 --> 02:07:09,000
SAM: No, I would like
to take 12 hours to read my book.

2733
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
MATT: Okay, so the first 12 hours 
are completed,

2734
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,000
but you do not sleep?

2735
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,000
SAM: No.

2736
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
LIAM: It's a page-turner.

2737
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
SAM: Lots of centerfolds.

2738
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,420
(laughter)

2739
02:07:19,420 --> 02:07:21,500
TRAVIS: Don't be stingy,
share those with me.

2740
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:23,000
MATT: Written by John Cleese.
It's a wonderful piece.

2741
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:26,000
LAURA: I also spend
a lot of time that night reading,

2742
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
but I'm reading
the book about the Raven Queen.

2743
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,700
MATT: Okay.

2744
02:07:29,700 --> 02:07:32,200
LAURA: Pretty much
have it memorized at this point.

2745
02:07:32,200 --> 02:07:35,000
MATT: Yeah, fair enough. All right.

2746
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,110
You guys all find yourself to rest,
except for Scanlan,

2747
02:07:37,110 --> 02:07:38,500
who takes
a point of exhaustion

2748
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:40,000
for going through the night
without sleep.

2749
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:41,000
SAM: I don't know what that is,
but someone will tell me.

2750
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:42,000
TRAVIS: You'll find out.

2751
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
MATT: Yeah. Basically,
it means any ability checks,

2752
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
any skill checks
until you get a full night's rest

2753
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,410
are at disadvantage, yeah.

2754
02:07:48,410 --> 02:07:50,870
All right, as you find yourselves to rest,
most of you

2755
02:07:50,870 --> 02:07:53,000
the morning light comes, 
greeting you to a new day,

2756
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,000
and we're going to go ahead
and take a break.

2757
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,500
We'll be back here
in a few minutes, guys.

2758
02:07:55,500 --> 02:07:59,000

2762
02:08:06,870 --> 02:08:09,000
MARISHA: And get your Joe Mad poster!
MATT: Joe Mad poster!

2763
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,000
MARISHA: Right now, pre-order.

2764
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,000
SAM: Wait, there's a giveaway
at the break, I think.

2765
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:12,000
LAURA: Oh, there's
a Loot Crate giveaway.

2766
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,000
MARISHA: Oh, and giveaway!

2767
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:16,000
MATT: For the DX boxes,
so be active in the chat.

2768
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
LIAM: And please go check out
the Joe Mad poster.

2769
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:19,000
LAURA: It's so sick.

2770
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
LIAM: Also check out
Battle Chasers Night War.

2771
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,310
It's a beautiful-looking game.
I played it today.

2772
02:08:23,310 --> 02:08:26,000
LAURA: Also, give your friend a hug.
Love each other.

2773
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah, and a high-five.

2774
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:31,000
SAM: Bathe in blood.
We'll see you soon.

2775
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:38,120
[Critical Role resumes at 2:22:43]

2776
02:22:43,940 --> 02:22:47,000
MATT: Welcome back, guys.
So, as we return to the game,

2777
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:50,000
the morning comes to you all
in Vasselheim

2778
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:53,000
as you awake
in the Slayer's Take guildhall.

2779
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:56,000
A brisk morning, but not too cold.

2780
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:59,000
The clouds are actually
a little more separate this morning.

2781
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
You get brief moments of blue;

2782
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
it looks like the weather
is a little clearer

2783
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
than you're used to seeing
in this vicinity.

2784
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:08,220
But the day is yours.
What do you guys wish to do?

2785
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
LIAM: What do we need
to accomplish here in town?

2786
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:13,500
Is there anything
we need to finish,

2787
02:23:13,500 --> 02:23:16,560
or do we want
to pick our next destination?

2788
02:23:16,560 --> 02:23:18,500
SAM: Do they sell 
potions and things here in town--

2789
02:23:18,500 --> 02:23:20,960
SAM: No, they don't.
TALIESIN: No, very specifically they don't.

2790
02:23:20,960 --> 02:23:22,540
SAM: Then let's
get the hell out of here.

2791
02:23:22,540 --> 02:23:24,070
There's nothing for us here.

2792
02:23:24,070 --> 02:23:26,000
TRAVIS: What about the Feywild?
SAM: Oh, yeah.

2793
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:27,500
MARISHA: We did talk
about the Feywild.

2794
02:23:27,500 --> 02:23:29,000
TALIESIN: Let's drop off our--

2795
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:30,500
LAURA: Don't tease me about the Feywild.

2796
02:23:30,500 --> 02:23:32,000
TRAVIS: Wait, don't you have
to pick up something?

2797
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
TALIESIN: Oh, I already picked it up.
TRAVIS: Not you, you.

2798
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
SAM: Me?
TALIESIN: Oh, you have a hat.

2799
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:37,500
SAM: I thought we waited for the hat.

2800
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:39,000
MATT: Yeah, he picked up the hat.

2801
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, balls, ass.
All right.

2802
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:44,000
SAM: There's the Feywild.

2803
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
There's dropping stuff off
at Whitestone.

2804
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:50,000
There's Marquet,
which something is there in Marquet?

2805
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:51,500
LAURA: Is one of the Vestiges there?

2806
02:23:51,500 --> 02:23:54,000
SAM: I don't know,
everyone just keeps talking about it.

2807
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
TRAVIS: Really?

2808
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:59,000
SAM: Wait, weren't we 
going to go to--

2809
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:02,000
MARISHA: One of the Vestiges
is in Marquet.

2810
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,290
LAURA: Which one?

2811
02:24:04,290 --> 02:24:09,000
MARISHA: Hang on. Cabal's Ruin,
which is a magic-devouring cloak--

2812
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:13,000
TRAVIS: Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Are we alone in this room?

2813
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:17,000
MATT: You guys are right now
having breakfast in the guildhall.

2814
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:20,000
There's maybe two
other individuals in the room.

2815
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
One of them is
drunkenly asleep and snoring.

2816
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
The other appears to be
going about their business.

2817
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:25,500
TRAVIS: I'm just saying.

2818
02:24:25,500 --> 02:24:29,000
MARISHA: (whispering)
Okay, I'll speak quietly.

2819
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:33,000
There's apparently
a magic-devouring cloak

2820
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:39,000
who is being worn by the--

2821
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:42,000
it's in Ank'Harel.
It's being worn by...

2822
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
LAURA: It's a cloak
that devours magic?

2823
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:47,000
MARISHA: A merchant warrior
with a missing eye.

2824
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
SAM: And there's one
in the bottom of the sea somewhere.

2825
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:53,170
LAURA: And there's a really beautiful 
strong bow in the Feywild.

2826
02:24:53,170 --> 02:24:55,620
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go to the Feywild!
We at least know that place.

2827
02:24:55,620 --> 02:25:01,000
TALIESIN: I say we drop everything--
we take a pit stop in Whitestone

2828
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,430
and head towards the Feywild.

2829
02:25:03,430 --> 02:25:06,050
MARISHA: So, technically,

2830
02:25:06,050 --> 02:25:09,000
we don't even have
to head towards the Feywild.

2831
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:10,500
Do you guys remember

2832
02:25:10,500 --> 02:25:16,000
how I kind of did that thing
with Grog's evil sword

2833
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:19,000
and kind of
banished it away for forever?

2834
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
TRAVIS: Are we bringing it back?
MARISHA: No.

2835
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:22,500
LAURA: Yeah, to the Dread Emperor's.
MARISHA: Right.

2836
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:25,000
LIAM: Not a good idea, Grog.

2837
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:26,500
MARISHA: No, we're not
bringing it back.

2838
02:25:26,500 --> 02:25:30,000
I can do that with the rest of us.

2839
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
LAURA: You can banish us
to the Dread Emperor's island?

2840
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:33,500
MARISHA: No, it's not like
a banishment.

2841
02:25:33,500 --> 02:25:36,110
I can Plane Shift us
wherever we want to go,

2842
02:25:36,110 --> 02:25:38,000
to an alternate plane.

2843
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:39,500
LAURA: To the Feywild?

2844
02:25:39,500 --> 02:25:41,000
So we don't even
have to find an entrance?

2845
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
MARISHA: Yeah, we just hold hands
and think about it really hard.

2846
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:44,500
TRAVIS: No way.

2847
02:25:44,500 --> 02:25:47,000
MARISHA: Yeah.
It's druid magic. It's great.

2848
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:48,500
LIAM: And you put us

2849
02:25:48,500 --> 02:25:51,000
in a safe spot 
somewhere in there, somehow?

2850
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:52,500
MARISHA: I can take us

2851
02:25:52,500 --> 02:25:57,000
to where we've been before,
to where it's familiar.

2852
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:58,500
LIAM: Have we been there before?
I don't know.

2853
02:25:58,500 --> 02:26:00,000
MARISHA: Very briefly.
TALIESIN: Yes.

2854
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
LAURA: Is it somewhere
that you have to have been,

2855
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:05,000
or can it be somewhere
that we have been.

2856
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:12,000
MARISHA: It is somewhere
I am familiar with, I believe,

2857
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:16,000
through means that I am familiar...

2858
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
LAURA: Syngorn is in the Feywild.

2859
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:19,500
SAM: Normally?

2860
02:26:19,500 --> 02:26:21,610
LIAM: No, not normally.

2861
02:26:21,610 --> 02:26:23,500
LAURA: They transferred 
the entire city there.

2862
02:26:23,500 --> 02:26:25,000
LIAM: I know, but you're saying
we've been there,

2863
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:26,500
but they just did that recently.

2864
02:26:26,500 --> 02:26:28,000
SAM: Grog's been to the Feywild.

2865
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:29,500
MATT: You can specify a target

2866
02:26:29,500 --> 02:26:31,000
MARISHA: In general terms.
MATT: In general terms.

2867
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:34,200
MARISHA: Such as "City of Brass
on the Elemental Plane of Fire."

2868
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:35,710
SAM: Oh, is that
where we're going?

2869
02:26:35,710 --> 02:26:36,860
MARISHA: No.

2870
02:26:36,860 --> 02:26:40,480
SAM: Oh. Sounds like fun.
TALIESIN: It does, actually.

2871
02:26:40,480 --> 02:26:43,000
MARISHA: If you guys want to go
to the Plane of Fire,

2872
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
that's like,
a hike and a jump through a hole.

2873
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:46,500
TALIESIN: Ah.

2874
02:26:46,500 --> 02:26:49,000
TRAVIS: No, no, not the Plane of Fire.
Just the Feywild.

2875
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:53,240
MARISHA: All right.
Yeah, I can get us there.

2876
02:26:53,240 --> 02:26:54,400
SAM: To the Feywild.

2877
02:26:54,400 --> 02:26:57,000
How big is the Feywild?
Is it like a football field?

2878
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
MARISHA: It's very big.
LAURA: It's a whole other plane.

2879
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:00,500
SAM: Well, how do--

2880
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:02,180
do we know where we're going
in the Feywild?

2881
02:27:02,180 --> 02:27:04,500
MARISHA: I imagine we'll figure it out
once we get there.

2882
02:27:04,500 --> 02:27:06,660
TALIESIN: Do I know anything
about the Feywild?

2883
02:27:06,660 --> 02:27:09,300
MATT: You have
no knowledge of the Feywild.

2884
02:27:09,300 --> 02:27:11,650
ASHLEY: Would I know anything else?
MARISHA: What about me?

2885
02:27:11,650 --> 02:27:13,780
LAURA: Would we have learned 
something about it in Syngorn?

2886
02:27:13,780 --> 02:27:16,500
MATT: You have
a general idea of it, somewhat--

2887
02:27:16,500 --> 02:27:18,000
MARISHA: Team Half-Elf, yeah.

2888
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:19,500
MATT: Somewhat,
just through your learning.

2889
02:27:19,500 --> 02:27:21,000
You never actually visited there.

2890
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:24,000
The Feywild is a near plane,

2891
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:28,210
a plane that overlaps
this Prime Material Plane.

2892
02:27:28,210 --> 02:27:32,000
It's a version
of the world you live in right now

2893
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
that is shifted and changed

2894
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:41,000
in a place where time,
distance is relative and shifts.

2895
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Nature grows rampant and in cases

2896
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:50,000
is hard to really expect its direction.

2897
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Things and entities exist there

2898
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:58,000
that prefer to trick and lose wanderers.

2899
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:02,000
It's a very strange place
where some believe

2900
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:06,000
elves initially come from
or craft from there, at least.

2901
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:07,500
LIAM: Do the two of us know enough

2902
02:28:07,500 --> 02:28:10,620
that were you to jump
from the same place here,

2903
02:28:10,620 --> 02:28:14,000
would you necessarily end up
in the same spot in the Feywild?

2904
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:15,500
MATT: You have no idea.

2905
02:28:15,500 --> 02:28:17,000
LIAM: We don't know. All right.

2906
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:18,500
MATT: You don't know anything
about the transition to the Feywild.

2907
02:28:18,500 --> 02:28:21,000
You just know that certain doors open
at certain times,

2908
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:24,000
especially with full moons
in certain locations,

2909
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
the classic toadstool rings,

2910
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:30,630
areas where the moonlight
in the realms

2911
02:28:30,630 --> 02:28:33,680
can be a little thinner
and the barrier doors do open,

2912
02:28:33,680 --> 02:28:37,700
and those are where creatures
can transition out or through.

2913
02:28:37,700 --> 02:28:43,000
You do know it's a place of fey magic,

2914
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:48,000
it's tricky, it's difficult to follow.

2915
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
SAM: Terrible.
LAURA: It sounds awful.

2916
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:55,650
MATT: Very, like, Oberon and Titania.
Weird. Interesting.

2917
02:28:55,650 --> 02:29:00,000
MARISHA: Question.
MATT: Yes?

2918
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:04,000
MARISHA: Hmm, okay.
SAM: Good question.

2919
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:08,000
MARISHA: It says
the Wrath of the Fey Warden

2920
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:11,000
is what we're looking for, the bow,
and that it now acts

2921
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:17,000
as the heart of a cancerous tree,
corrupting the verdant land.

2922
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Is there something I can do,
maybe try and...

2923
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:26,000
TRAVIS: Hold on, is our stream up?
Are we offline right now?

2924
02:29:27,660 --> 02:29:29,960
LUCAS: (muffled, from offscreen)
I'm checking. Just wait.

2925
02:29:30,780 --> 02:29:33,000
ASHLEY: Hold, please.

2926
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,940
LUCAS: It says we're still online.
Hang on.

2927
02:29:35,940 --> 02:29:39,000
LIAM: Loot Crate. Check out Loot Crate.
SAM: No one can see it.

2928
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
LAURA: No, it says it's offline.

2929
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:42,500
LIAM: Refresh it.
MARISHA: It says offline?

2930
02:29:42,500 --> 02:29:44,170
LIAM: Quit the program
and go back in.

2931
02:29:44,170 --> 02:29:46,000
TRAVIS: The chat is saying it's off.

2932
02:29:47,480 --> 02:29:50,000
LUCAS: No, we're still online.
LAURA: Okay.

2933
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:51,810
LIAM: Tell them to quit and re-login.
SAM: It's back. It's back.

2934
02:29:51,810 --> 02:29:53,400
LUCAS: I'm not sure what happened.

2935
02:29:53,400 --> 02:29:55,140
I'm not sure it even 
dropped frames on my end.

2936
02:29:55,140 --> 02:29:56,920
LIAM: Whoa, we were
in the Feywild for a second there.

2937
02:29:56,920 --> 02:29:59,000
ASHLEY: Oh, it was crazy.
MATT: You guys missed six episodes.

2938
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
(exaggerated sounds of relief)

2939
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
MATT: Everything turned out okay.

2940
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:06,360
LAURA: Yay! And we got the warden thing.
LIAM: Dragons are dead.

2941
02:30:06,360 --> 02:30:09,000
MARISHA: Guys, I'm so glad
we won DND. We beat it.

2942
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,230
LAURA: Yeah, that was the best.

2943
02:30:12,200 --> 02:30:14,200
TALIESIN: Roll the credits scroll.

2944
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:20,570
MARISHA: Can I maybe sense a sick tree?

2945
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,030
You know what?
Let's go to Whitestone.

2946
02:30:25,030 --> 02:30:27,110
Let's go to Whitestone
and drop some stuff off.

2947
02:30:27,110 --> 02:30:29,000
LAURA: You know,
because the more I think about it,

2948
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:32,000
I mean, we almost just
died many times

2949
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:33,500
and the last time we tried
to get a Vestige

2950
02:30:33,500 --> 02:30:35,000
it almost killed us,
and maybe we just need

2951
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
a little bit
more preparation, maybe?

2952
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:42,000
TALIESIN: Let's empty our bags,
let's prepare ourselves.

2953
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,540
There are certainly stories
in the woods of Whitestone

2954
02:30:44,540 --> 02:30:45,970
of strange happenings,

2955
02:30:45,970 --> 02:30:48,750
so I'm sure
there's probably some connection

2956
02:30:48,750 --> 02:30:51,000
to the Feywild,
and we'll see what happens.

2957
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:52,500
LAURA: Make sure Whitestone 
is actually

2958
02:30:52,500 --> 02:30:55,000
preparing something underground
just like Westruun.

2959
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
TALIESIN: Well, we have something.

2960
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
MARISHA: Yes, they have
something underground already.

2961
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:03,000
LAURA: Exactly, but there's
a spinning orb of death there.

2962
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:04,500
TALIESIN: Which, to be fair,

2963
02:31:04,500 --> 02:31:06,000
is probably going
to keep a dragon away.

2964
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
LIAM: But I also think

2965
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
we've earned more
than a single day of rest.

2966
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
TALIESIN: Yes.

2967
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
LIAM: Let's go to Whitestone.
TALIESIN: Let's go to Whitestone.

2968
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
MARISHA: All right.
ASHLEY: Where's the sea?

2969
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
SAM: The Ozmit Sea?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2970
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:22,000
MATT: The Ozmit Sea is
to the east of you, east-southeast,

2971
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:25,000
and that is a wide gulf that separates--

2972
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
from your perspective, looking at me,

2973
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:33,000
there's Othanzia, Ozmit Sea,
and there's Tal'Dorei right here.

2974
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
LAURA: Oh, okay.

2975
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:36,220
LIAM: (sneezes)

2976
02:31:36,220 --> 02:31:37,770
TALIESIN AND MARISHA: Bless you.
LAURA: Bless you.

2977
02:31:37,770 --> 02:31:43,000
MARISHA: The Water Ashari
live in the Ozmit Sea.

2978
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
LAURA: Are they like mermaids?

2979
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
MARISHA: No, I think they've got an island.

2980
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
ASHLEY: It's also the sea that I sailed.

2981
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:50,200
MARISHA: Really?
LAURA: (gasps)

2982
02:31:50,200 --> 02:31:51,460
SAM: Ohhh.
TALIESIN: Really?

2983
02:31:51,460 --> 02:31:53,500
LAURA: In your roving pirate days.

2984
02:31:53,500 --> 02:31:55,160
ASHLEY: I know it well.

2985
02:31:55,160 --> 02:31:57,500
MARISHA: How familiar are you 
with the sea?

2986
02:31:57,500 --> 02:32:00,000
ASHLEY: I'm pretty familiar with it.

2987
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:01,680
TRAVIS: What if we go there?

2988
02:32:01,680 --> 02:32:03,120
SAM: We could.

2989
02:32:03,120 --> 02:32:05,000
LAURA: Wait, could I see 
the list of Vestiges?

2990
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:08,000
SAM: The one in the bottom of the sea
is called Whisper, right?

2991
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:09,610
LAURA: Whisper?

2992
02:32:09,610 --> 02:32:15,000
MARISHA: A blade forged from metal
pulled from the Far Realm,

2993
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
it was the center of many dark rituals.

2994
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
SAM: It now lies
at the bottom of the Ozmit Sea,

2995
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:22,000
sunken with the lost ship,
The Shrew.

2996
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
LAURA: (sing-song) The Shrew?
ASHLEY: (deep voice) The Shrew.

2997
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:27,000
SAM: A storm three hundred years ago
near an island of glass.

2998
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
Anyone know about the island of glass?

2999
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:30,500
LAURA: Have you heard
about an island of glass?

3000
02:32:30,500 --> 02:32:32,300
MARISHA: Have I heard
about an island of glass?

3001
02:32:32,300 --> 02:32:33,990
Have Pike or I heard
of an island of glass?

3002
02:32:33,990 --> 02:32:36,320
MATT: I'll have both of you guys
make history checks.

3003
02:32:36,320 --> 02:32:37,430
MARISHA: All right.

3004
02:32:39,660 --> 02:32:41,390
I rolled a natural 1.

3005
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:46,000
MATT: You barely know
what glass is right now.

3006
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
MARISHA: Guys, water isn't glass,
that's stupid.

3007
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
TALIESIN: I would have
a theory as to what it was.

3008
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:51,500
TRAVIS: She rolled a 20.

3009
02:32:51,500 --> 02:32:54,520
MARISHA: You rolled a 20? Oh, go Pike!
ASHLEY: Not a natural 20. Total.

3010
02:32:54,520 --> 02:32:56,000
MATT: Explain.

3011
02:32:56,000 --> 02:33:02,000
TALIESIN: Should I roll to figure out
that this is probably an active volcano?

3012
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

3013
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:05,700
TALIESIN: I'm down.

3014
02:33:05,700 --> 02:33:07,390
LIAM: Come on, man.

3015
02:33:07,390 --> 02:33:09,500
TALIESIN: No! Wow.

3016
02:33:09,500 --> 02:33:11,420
SAM: Onesies.
MARISHA: Team ones. Whoo.

3017
02:33:11,420 --> 02:33:13,190
MATT: Natural 1?
TALIESIN: Natural 1.

3018
02:33:13,190 --> 02:33:14,470
LIAM: Snitch.

3019
02:33:14,470 --> 02:33:15,950
MATT: Doesn't quite come to you,
but what it could be.

3020
02:33:15,950 --> 02:33:18,000
The idea of a volcano
possibly comes to mind, but--

3021
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:19,500
TALIESIN: I'm distracted.

3022
02:33:19,500 --> 02:33:21,000
MATT: Yeah.

3023
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:24,000
You have not been there,
you haven't seen it,

3024
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
but some of your crewmates
while you were traveling

3025
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:32,000
aboard your ship
for that five, six-month period,

3026
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:35,000
a couple of them did mention something
about on the sea,

3027
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:39,000
a mirage-like island
that glistens in the distance,

3028
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,730
but they said to avoid it,
said it was dangerous.

3029
02:33:41,730 --> 02:33:44,060
SAM: Did they say where it was?

3030
02:33:44,060 --> 02:33:45,500
MATT: No.
SAM: Damn it.

3031
02:33:45,500 --> 02:33:47,500
ASHLEY: Heard many tales of The Shrew.

3032
02:33:47,500 --> 02:33:48,950
LAURA: Yeah?
ASHLEY: Yeah, the ship lost at sea.

3033
02:33:48,950 --> 02:33:52,000
MATT: You know of The Shrew,
you definitely know of The Shrew.

3034
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:53,500
ASHLEY: All sailors know of The Shrew.

3035
02:33:53,500 --> 02:33:57,000
MARISHA: What's the story of The Shrew?
SAM: Come on, sailor.

3036
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:01,000
ASHLEY: There was a storm
three hundred years ago.

3037
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:04,000
LAURA: Near an island of glass?
ASHLEY: Near an island of glass.

3038
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:05,500
MARISHA: It was really bad.

3039
02:34:05,500 --> 02:34:07,000
ASHLEY: And The Shrew
just didn't sail on.

3040
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
SAM: It was tamed.
ASHLEY: It was tamed.

3041
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
LAURA: (laughs) I was waiting for it to--

3042
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:12,500
MATT: Come around again?
Yeah, it was good.

3043
02:34:12,500 --> 02:34:14,000
LAURA: Come around, yep.
TALIESIN: Taming of the Shrew fits, yeah.

3044
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,500
ASHLEY: Good tale,
but we'll get there one day.

3045
02:34:16,500 --> 02:34:18,000
MATT: What's the plan?

3046
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:19,500
LIAM: Whitestone.
SAM: Yes, Whitestone.

3047
02:34:19,500 --> 02:34:21,860
TRAVIS: Can I make 
one other suggestion?

3048
02:34:21,860 --> 02:34:23,360
Emon...

3049
02:34:23,360 --> 02:34:25,360
go take Thordak right now.

3050
02:34:25,360 --> 02:34:28,010
SAM: Good call...
TRAVIS: Yeah, one taker?

3051
02:34:28,010 --> 02:34:30,420
MARISHA: You know what, Grog?
LAURA: It's a good plan, Grog.

3052
02:34:30,420 --> 02:34:31,830
LIAM: It's cheeky.

3053
02:34:31,830 --> 02:34:34,000
MARISHA: We will put that
in our back pocket

3054
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:35,870
and we will think about it.

3055
02:34:35,870 --> 02:34:38,010
LIAM: That helmet
is really something else.

3056
02:34:38,010 --> 02:34:40,500
LAURA: You could really do 
something terrible to him with that thing.

3057
02:34:40,500 --> 02:34:43,000
TRAVIS: I'm just saying,
I think we have an edge now.

3058
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
LAURA: I think you're probably right.
SAM: (chuckle) Attaboy.

3059
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:48,500
LIAM: That's technically true, yes.
TALIESIN: You do... have a point.

3060
02:34:48,500 --> 02:34:50,700
LAURA: But let's make sure 
that Whitestone is safe

3061
02:34:50,700 --> 02:34:52,020
before we do such a thing.

3062
02:34:52,020 --> 02:34:54,570
SAM: Percy, we are in a place
that has an airship dock.

3063
02:34:54,570 --> 02:34:56,000
TALIESIN: That is true.

3064
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:57,500
SAM: We could go steal an airship.

3065
02:34:57,500 --> 02:34:59,000
TALIESIN: We could go steal an airship!

3066
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
LAURA: We don't need an airship.
MARISHA: We don't need an airship.

3067
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:02,500
LAURA: We have an instant ability
to transport anywhere.

3068
02:35:02,500 --> 02:35:04,460
SAM: It would be so cool, though.

3069
02:35:04,460 --> 02:35:06,340
TALIESIN: Then we wouldn't
have to go to Whitestone.

3070
02:35:06,340 --> 02:35:08,000
It would hold all of our things.

3071
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:09,500
LAURA AND MARISHA: 
When we kill all the dragons...

3072
02:35:09,500 --> 02:35:11,000
TALIESIN: We could hold 
all of our things on the airship,

3073
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:12,660
and I could have cannonades...

3074
02:35:12,660 --> 02:35:15,000
LAURA: That will be the first thing we do
when Thordak dies

3075
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:16,500
is we jump on an airship.

3076
02:35:16,500 --> 02:35:17,500
ASHLEY: Party on the airship.

3077
02:35:17,500 --> 02:35:19,320
MARISHA: We'll buy it
with all of the gold

3078
02:35:19,320 --> 02:35:20,720
that we've stolen
from all the dragons.

3079
02:35:20,720 --> 02:35:21,930
It'll be great.

3080
02:35:21,930 --> 02:35:24,500
TALIESIN: We won't need the airship
if the dragons are dead.

3081
02:35:24,500 --> 02:35:26,790
LAURA: All the fun has gone out of it.
TRAVIS: What are we doing?

3082
02:35:26,790 --> 02:35:28,510
LAURA: We're going to Whitestone.
MARISHA: We're going to Whitestone.

3083
02:35:28,510 --> 02:35:29,720
MARISHA: (piercing spell noise)

3084
02:35:29,720 --> 02:35:32,000
SAM: Before we leave, do you want 
to sell these stupid white dragon scales?

3085
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:32,920
TALIESIN: No.
SAM: All right, let's go.

3086
02:35:32,920 --> 02:35:34,010
LIAM: Let's go to Whitestone.

3087
02:35:34,010 --> 02:35:35,650
MARISHA: (repeats piercing spell noise) 
Through a tree!

3088
02:35:35,650 --> 02:35:38,000
MATT: All right, as you guys walk 
outside of the Slayer's Take guildhall,

3089
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,470
you find the nearest tree,
which you've used before to traverse.

3090
02:35:40,470 --> 02:35:43,290
As you all step through the portal,
Percy and Scanlan

3091
02:35:43,290 --> 02:35:46,000
look over their shoulder
at the distant skyport

3092
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:50,000
and see the one airship docked there
and think, "One day..."

3093
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,280
LIAM: So handsome.

3094
02:35:52,280 --> 02:35:56,000
SAM: Someday, it will be ours.
TALIESIN: You'll make a fine sailor.

3095
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:59,000
SAM: Passenger.
LIAM: Swabby.

3096
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:03,540
MATT: You jump through
and emerge out the other side.

3097
02:36:03,540 --> 02:36:07,000
As you step out of the portal,
you find yourself

3098
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:10,000
jumping out of the center
of the Sun Tree.

3099
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
MARISHA: Can I do something?
SAM: Nope.

3100
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
MATT: What do you want to do?

3101
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:18,950
MARISHA: While I'm in the tree,
can I do something?

3102
02:36:18,950 --> 02:36:20,960
TRAVIS: Like kill us all?

3103
02:36:20,960 --> 02:36:24,000
No no no. Say they go first.
"Go, go, go, go."

3104
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
And I kind of start teleporting
through the tree

3105
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:31,000
and while I'm in the Sun Tree
I just want to be like,

3106
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:34,000
"Hey, boo."

3107
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
LAURA: (laughs)

3108
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
MARISHA: "I missed you.

3109
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:42,000
"Have you heard of this whole
cancerous tree situation

3110
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:43,630
"in the Feywild?"

3111
02:36:43,630 --> 02:36:45,500
SAM: (whispering) You're talking to a tree?

3112
02:36:45,500 --> 02:36:47,000
MARISHA: Shh, no.
I'm in the middle of the tree.

3113
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:48,500
I'm in the tree.

3114
02:36:48,500 --> 02:36:50,390
LAURA: You're stuck in the tree?

3115
02:36:50,390 --> 02:36:53,000
MATT: As you finish this thought,
you hear this sound emerge

3116
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:56,570
(vacuum sealing sound)
and realize it's the sound

3117
02:36:56,570 --> 02:36:58,500
of the whole portal you've made
closing behind you

3118
02:36:58,500 --> 02:37:00,000
because it only lasts for six seconds

3119
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:01,500
and you should probably
get the hell out of the tree.

3120
02:37:01,500 --> 02:37:03,000
MARISHA: Aww. I step out of the tree.

3121
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:04,190
ASHLEY: Good try.

3122
02:37:04,190 --> 02:37:06,000
MATT: As you step out, a voice goes,

3123
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:07,500
"Hey, boo, sorry.(kiss noise)"

3124
02:37:07,500 --> 02:37:09,000
(laughter)

3125
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:12,000
MATT: And it closes behind you.

3126
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,720
MARISHA: I'll talk to him later.

3127
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
MATT: You guys emerge.

3128
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:23,000
Due to the time differences,
you land here in Whitestone,

3129
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:29,000
looking at where the sun is in the sky,
it's early afternoon,

3130
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:33,000
as opposed to the morning
where you guys just stepped away from.

3131
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:36,000
There are people in the streets,
and you see a few,

3132
02:37:37,570 --> 02:37:40,000
a little bit of life
has returned to this town square,

3133
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
though still, by comparison--

3134
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:45,000
there are folks now
that are bringing in actual,

3135
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:49,000
healthy, looks to be fruits
from nearby trees.

3136
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:50,500
There's a little bit of trade going on.

3137
02:37:50,500 --> 02:37:52,000
This is the first real chance you've had

3138
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:56,000
to see a little bit of Whitestone
coming to life again.

3139
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:59,000
As you emerge from the tree,
a few individuals nearby

3140
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:04,000
stop and look and smile and wave,
recognizing you as you approach.

3141
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
LAURA: Are there any leaves
on the Sun Tree yet?

3142
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:10,530
MATT: Actually, no, there are not.
There are no leaves on the Sun Tree.

3143
02:38:10,530 --> 02:38:12,470
SAM: (quietly) Because it's winter.

3144
02:38:12,470 --> 02:38:14,060
LAURA: Whatever.

3145
02:38:14,060 --> 02:38:16,000
TRAVIS: We should check
with the border patrol.

3146
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,500
SAM: There's a border patrol?

3147
02:38:18,500 --> 02:38:20,000
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: A wolf.

3148
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:21,500
SAM: Oh, the wolf.

3149
02:38:21,500 --> 02:38:24,000
TRAVIS: (whistles) I whistle
as loud as I can.

3150
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:27,040
MATT: Okay.
SAM: What's his name?

3151
02:38:27,040 --> 02:38:30,000
MARISHA: I don't know.
Let me find it.

3152
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,130
SAM: Oh, boy. Harold?

3153
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
LAURA: I just want to go find Zahra

3154
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
and give her a hug and say hello
and see how she's doing

3155
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:41,000
while he's talking.

3156
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:45,000
MATT: You whistle as loud as you can
for a little bit. Nothing.

3157
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:49,000
TRAVIS: Must be off doing something
(belches) important.

3158
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:50,340
TALIESIN: Quite.

3159
02:38:50,340 --> 02:38:53,000
MATT: You head off and, asking around,

3160
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:57,000
you find Zahra is actually
up in Castle Whitestone right now,

3161
02:38:57,000 --> 02:39:00,000
just poring through
one of the studies of books,

3162
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:01,500
and is just currently
reading and reading on her own.

3163
02:39:01,500 --> 02:39:03,000
As you eventually ask around
and find your way there,

3164
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
entering the room, you see her

3165
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
with a small set of spectacles
at the end of her nose.

3166
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
She takes them off and,

3167
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
"My darling Vex'ahlia!"

3168
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:12,500
And comes up
and just gives you a big hug

3169
02:39:12,500 --> 02:39:14,450
and picks you up and sets you down.

3170
02:39:14,450 --> 02:39:16,640
"I'm so glad to see 
you're all right."

3171
02:39:16,640 --> 02:39:19,140
LAURA: Dear, the dragon arrow 
you gave me? Killed him.

3172
02:39:19,140 --> 02:39:21,500
Well, I didn't kill him,
actually, with it,

3173
02:39:21,500 --> 02:39:23,000
but I did a lot of damage.

3174
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:26,000
MATT: "You killed a dragon?"
LAURA: Umbrasyl. Dead. One down.

3175
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:30,000
MATT: "I knew you would."

3176
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:31,500
LAURA: Where's Cashew?

3177
02:39:31,500 --> 02:39:34,000
MATT: "I don't know.
He's testy these days.

3178
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:35,500
"I'm sure he's around."

3179
02:39:35,500 --> 02:39:38,000
LAURA: I know his name 
is fucking Kashaw.

3180
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:41,000
So he's not there.

3181
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
MATT: "Probably down
in the city somewhere.

3182
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:47,000
"He's helping where he can.
You know broody types."

3183
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
LAURA: I do know broody types.

3184
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:50,500
MATT: Yes, you do.

3185
02:39:50,500 --> 02:39:52,000
LAURA: What are you reading?

3186
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
MATT: "Oh, I'm just learning
about the history of Whitestone

3187
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
"and I'm very intrigued
as to the actual properties

3188
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:59,000
"of this stone 
the entire town is built on.

3189
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:03,000
"There's a lot of really,
really interesting things

3190
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:06,000
"that can be done with the materials
in these mountains."

3191
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
LAURA: I'm sure you have ideas.
MATT: "I do."

3192
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
LAURA: I sit down next to her and ask,
just catching up,

3193
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:14,000
and see if they've spotted any dragons.

3194
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
MATT: You guys continue your conversation,
catching up,

3195
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
letting her know how things happened,
and vice versa.

3196
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
You don't get any info
that any dragons have come by.

3197
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:25,000
Apparently, there have been
a few other arcane practitioners

3198
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:30,000
that have been helping set up
some sort of barrier to help,

3199
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:34,000
essentially,
dissuade attention towards the city.

3200
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:37,000
The idea of keeping this place
as far off the map as possible,

3201
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:40,000
should any prying eyes
find their way there.

3202
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:43,000
It's in the process
of being set up right now.

3203
02:40:44,400 --> 02:40:50,000
LAURA: Zahra, how long did it take you
to make that arrow?

3204
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:55,000
MATT: "A few weeks."

3205
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:58,000
LAURA: If I were to give you
some more money,

3206
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
do you think you could do it again?

3207
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:09,000
MATT: "Probably, based on what--
(sighs) if I'm able to use

3208
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:13,000
"some of the resources
here within the castle, maybe."

3209
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:16,000
LAURA: I'll talk to Percy,
but I'm sure, if it's for a good cause...

3210
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
MATT: "All right, perhaps I can."

3211
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:19,500
LAURA: All right. 
I'll come find you, dear.

3212
02:41:19,500 --> 02:41:21,000
MATT: "Wondrous."

3213
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
What else are you guys 
trying to achieve here?

3214
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,500
LIAM: I am trying to find Shaun Gilmore.

3215
02:41:28,500 --> 02:41:30,490
LAURA: That's his first name?
SAM: Shaun Gilmore?

3216
02:41:30,490 --> 02:41:31,920
MATT AND MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah, Shaun.

3217
02:41:31,920 --> 02:41:34,240
LAURA: Shaun? 
How did you know that?

3218
02:41:34,240 --> 02:41:35,500
MARISHA: He told us.

3219
02:41:35,500 --> 02:41:37,000
MATT: He told you guys that
a long time ago.

3220
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,500
LAURA: I fucking know, I remember.
MATT: (laughs)

3221
02:41:39,500 --> 02:41:41,000
TALIESIN: Tattooed
at the small of his back.

3222
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,060
MARISHA: Yeah, he's got a tramp stamp.
ASHLEY: Tramp stamp.

3223
02:41:43,060 --> 02:41:47,400
SAM: Can I accompany Vax on this trip?
LIAM: Sure, come on.

3224
02:41:47,400 --> 02:41:50,000
SAM: I want to see Gilmore.

3225
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
LIAM: Let's start
asking around town for him.

3226
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:55,000
MATT: You start asking around.

3227
02:41:55,000 --> 02:42:01,000
You come across
a few folks you recognize,

3228
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:05,000
you find a few of the guards
who helped you

3229
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:08,000
with the initial reconstruction
of this city and such

3230
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
and asking around.

3231
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
One of the nearby guards
takes his helmet off and is like,

3232
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:13,500
"First off, I am so excited

3233
02:42:13,500 --> 02:42:16,000
"that you guys are back.
I'm so glad you're all safe.

3234
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:19,000
"I heard that you were
off to do some dangerous things."

3235
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
LIAM: You heard right.

3236
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:25,000
MATT: "Well, great,
I'm glad that you've survived.

3237
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
"Looking for Mr. Gilmore,

3238
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:32,000
"he's actually down with the Realmseer.

3239
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:35,000
"They're inspecting
the ziggurat underneath the city,

3240
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:38,540
"so you could head down there
if you wanted to find him."

3241
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
LIAM: Thank you.

3242
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:45,000
I'm not terribly familiar
with Whitestone,

3243
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:46,500
could you point us
in the right direction?

3244
02:42:46,500 --> 02:42:48,000
MATT: "It's under the castle."

3245
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:49,500
LIAM: The castle.
MATT: "Yes."

3246
02:42:49,500 --> 02:42:51,000
LIAM: Can't miss that.

3247
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:52,940
SAM: Yeah, we've been there before.
Yeah, let's go.

3248
02:42:52,940 --> 02:42:54,110
LIAM: Let's go.

3249
02:42:54,110 --> 02:42:55,320
MATT: He puts his helmet back on.

3250
02:42:55,320 --> 02:42:57,400
"Thank you again 
for all that you do."

3251
02:42:57,400 --> 02:43:01,000
He clicks his heels together
and continues walking through the city.

3252
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
LIAM: All right, yeah.

3253
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
SAM: I guess we'll head
down to the ziggurat.

3254
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:06,500
LIAM: Let's do it.

3255
02:43:06,500 --> 02:43:08,000
MATT: Everyone else going with?

3256
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah, let's go.
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah.

3257
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:11,500
LAURA: We taking a trip?
TALIESIN: Sure.

3258
02:43:11,500 --> 02:43:13,960
MARISHA: Oh, are we all
going down to the ziggurat?

3259
02:43:13,960 --> 02:43:15,460
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Nothing else to do.

3260
02:43:15,460 --> 02:43:16,620
MARISHA: Sure.

3261
02:43:16,620 --> 02:43:17,690
MATT: All right. You make your way

3262
02:43:17,690 --> 02:43:20,080
down to the basement area
of Whitestone Castle,

3263
02:43:20,080 --> 02:43:21,930
into the family catacombs,

3264
02:43:21,930 --> 02:43:24,880
which have been cleaned up
and you can see

3265
02:43:24,880 --> 02:43:30,000
Cassandra has put a little bit of care
into restoring it to what it was before.

3266
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:33,560
The tunnel that was carved in
has been given a little more support,

3267
02:43:33,560 --> 02:43:37,000
and as you're making your way
down a familiar tunnel,

3268
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:42,000
the same tunnel where you had
the showdown with Orthax,

3269
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,850
you hear a few voices 
from up ahead.

3270
02:43:44,850 --> 02:43:46,020
Two familiar voices.

3271
02:43:46,020 --> 02:43:50,510
You hear the echo of some older,
gruff, elderly gentleman

3272
02:43:50,510 --> 02:43:54,000
and a little more rambunctious
familiar voice.

3273
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:57,000
As they turn the corner,
you see them deep in conversation.

3274
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
It's the Realmseer himself
hunched forward

3275
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:04,000
with his white hair
and balding top, turns around,

3276
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:07,250
"And it's a great mystery to me

3277
02:44:07,250 --> 02:44:11,940
"that they can put a--
Oh, look! They've returned.

3278
02:44:11,940 --> 02:44:14,000
"Vox Machina themselves."

3279
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:19,510
Gilmore, at this point,
opens his arms, standing and healthy.

3280
02:44:19,510 --> 02:44:21,500
"My god, I've been waiting for you."

3281
02:44:21,500 --> 02:44:23,000
LAURA: (laughs)
ASHLEY AND MARISHA: Aww.

3282
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:26,000
MATT: "And all of you
so graciously clean!"

3283
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:27,500
LAURA: You look so healthy, Gilmore!
ASHLEY: Very healthy.

3284
02:44:27,500 --> 02:44:29,000
MATT: "Well, I have you
to thank for that.

3285
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
"Still a ways to go."

3286
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:35,000
LIAM: But in two or three weeks,
it's not bad. You're looking well.

3287
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
MATT: "Well, you all have Kima
to thank for that.

3288
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:41,000
"She's been quite attentive
to my needs."

3289
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
MARISHA: How is Whitestone finding you?

3290
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,480
MATT: "Curious place, this Whitestone.

3291
02:44:47,480 --> 02:44:50,910
"Well, the company's interesting."

3292
02:44:50,910 --> 02:44:52,000
MARISHA: Sure.

3293
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:53,500
MATT: The Realmseer laughs. He's like,

3294
02:44:53,500 --> 02:44:57,000
"(chuckles) So I've heard."

3295
02:44:57,000 --> 02:45:00,000
"We've spent a little bit of time

3296
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
"looking at this strange oddity
beneath the city,

3297
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:05,000
"and I'm not going to lie to you,
it's really confusing.

3298
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:10,000
"I've a few theories on it,
as does the Arcanist,

3299
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:11,500
"but we're still comparing notes

3300
02:45:11,500 --> 02:45:14,000
"and we don't want
to jump to any conclusions,

3301
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:18,000
"as tests have been inconclusive
and rather dangerous so far.

3302
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:22,000
"However, before anything else
goes underway, I believe there's

3303
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:26,000
"a very important bit of business
that we must attend to."

3304
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
SAM: Business?
What business, Gilmore?

3305
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:32,000
MATT: And he walks straight up to Grog
and just gives you a big hug.

3306
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
SAM: Aww.
LAURA: Oh?

3307
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:35,500
MATT: And pats you on the shoulder
and is like,

3308
02:45:35,500 --> 02:45:37,000
"(chuckling) You big lug."

3309
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
TRAVIS: You... Gilmore.

3310
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
(laughter)

3311
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
MATT: Walks over to you, Pike,
and kneels down and gives you

3312
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
a little pinch on the cheek
and is like,

3313
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,670
"Looking as spry
and smiley as ever, I see."

3314
02:45:47,670 --> 02:45:49,060
ASHLEY: Hello, Shaun.

3315
02:45:49,060 --> 02:45:51,570
(more laughter)

3316
02:45:51,570 --> 02:45:53,340
ASHLEY: I give him a kiss
on the cheek.

3317
02:45:53,340 --> 02:45:57,030
MATT: "Ooh."
ASHLEY: (laughs) "Ooh."

3318
02:45:57,030 --> 02:45:59,000
MATT: He turns to you.

3319
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:02,000
"Vex'ahlia, look at you.
I hear, if my words say correct,

3320
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:05,000
"that you folks are
a recent dragon-slaying bunch, hmm?"

3321
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:08,450
LAURA: That we are.
MATT: "(chuckles) Good to know."

3322
02:46:08,450 --> 02:46:10,400
MATT: Skips over you.

3323
02:46:10,400 --> 02:46:12,100
LAURA: Oh.
ASHLEY: Save the best for last.

3324
02:46:12,100 --> 02:46:15,000
MATT: And goes to Scanlan
and goes to ruffle your hair, and goes,

3325
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:18,500
"And you, you,
my little bardish friend."

3326
02:46:18,500 --> 02:46:20,000
SAM: Little?

3327
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:21,500
MATT: "No, you're actually
physically little."

3328
02:46:21,500 --> 02:46:24,000
SAM: Oh, I know.
MATT: "You are a tinier person."

3329
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:25,500
MATT: "Embrace it!
It's what makes you different."

3330
02:46:25,500 --> 02:46:30,000
SAM: That's true, I suppose.
I suppose. Yes, absolutely.

3331
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:33,000
We've been spreading the good word
about you and your works.

3332
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:37,000
MATT: "So I've heard
from all sorts of interesting folk.

3333
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:40,000
"I only hope one day
to wear clothes as fine as you."

3334
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:44,000
SAM: Oh! That's a nice compliment.

3335
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:45,500
MATT: "Percival."
TALIESIN: Good patron.

3336
02:46:45,500 --> 02:46:47,000
MATT: "Thank you
for taking me into your home."

3337
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:50,000
TALIESIN: You do nothing
but brighten these halls.

3338
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:55,350
MATT: "I'm...
happy to keep things lit. (sighs)"

3339
02:46:55,350 --> 02:46:58,570
At which point,
he goes to look towards you.

3340
02:46:58,570 --> 02:47:00,500
The Realmseer's sitting there
tapping his arm; he's like,

3341
02:47:00,500 --> 02:47:05,000
"Right, get on with it,
we've got work to be done."

3342
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:09,000
And, "Shh. You be quiet.
These people have saved my life.

3343
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:13,000
"Keyleth. Sweet Ashari princess."

3344
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,490
MARISHA: Hi, Gilmore.

3345
02:47:15,490 --> 02:47:19,000
MATT: "You've grown.
I can see it in your eyes."

3346
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
He gives you a big hug.

3347
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:24,000
MARISHA: I give him a hug back.

3348
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:25,580
MATT: "Vax."

3349
02:47:25,580 --> 02:47:27,510
LAURA: (giggles)

3350
02:47:27,510 --> 02:47:34,000
MATT: "Vax'ildan.
Light of my eye. Smiling boy."

3351
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:37,000
(laughter)

3352
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,570
MATT: And he walks up
and puts his hands across your shoulders

3353
02:47:39,570 --> 02:47:41,000
and kind of cups your face.

3354
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
"I've missed you most of all."

3355
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:46,000
And pulls you in for a big hug
and lifts you up off the ground.

3356
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:47,240
LIAM: Oh, hey, you.

3357
02:47:47,240 --> 02:47:48,710
LAURA: You're strong enough to--
be careful of your wound, Gilmore!

3358
02:47:48,710 --> 02:47:50,230
MATT: As he sets you down, heâ€™s like,

3359
02:47:50,230 --> 02:47:52,400
"Ooh, I shouldn't have done that.
My apologies."

3360
02:47:52,400 --> 02:47:54,000
LIAM: I pat him on the ribs.

3361
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
MATT: "Don't touch that.
It's still very tender."

3362
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
LIAM: It's fantastic to see you.

3363
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:01,470
You're a sight for sore eyes, yourself.
We're very happy to see you.

3364
02:48:01,470 --> 02:48:05,000
MATT: "My sight is sore,
so this works out well.

3365
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:09,000
"But please, these tunnels are dank
and not becoming of us.

3366
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
"Dinner should be happening soon

3367
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
"and you should join us,
now that you've returned, please."

3368
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:17,000
MARISHA: Oh, before dinner,
I think we were all just curious

3369
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:22,000
on the state of the... ziggurat,
as we were calling it.

3370
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
LAURA: The orb.
MATT: "Let's talk over dinner."

3371
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:25,500
MARISHA: Spinning orb of death,
is what we call it.

3372
02:48:25,500 --> 02:48:28,000
MATT: "Let's talk over dinner."
MARISHA: All right, yeah, sure.

3373
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
TRAVIS: Wait, you said
you were doing tests on it, right?

3374
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
Did you throw things at it?
Did it blow up?

3375
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:35,000
MATT: "That is part of the test.
Nothing blew up. Things did go away."

3376
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
TRAVIS: They went away?

3377
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:38,500
LAURA: They get sucked in, Grog.

3378
02:48:38,500 --> 02:48:40,000
MATT: "We'll talk over dinner.

3379
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
"I hate to have this discussion
without Allura here.

3380
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,810
"I think this would only
behoove the conversation

3381
02:48:44,810 --> 02:48:46,000
"if we're all present."

3382
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:47,500
TALIESIN: An excellent argument.

3383
02:48:47,500 --> 02:48:50,000
LAURA: We have some delicious
and very expensive wine.

3384
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:51,500
MATT: "(chuckling) Well!"

3385
02:48:51,500 --> 02:48:53,000
ASHLEY: Expensive-ass wine.
LIAM: Yeah.

3386
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
LAURA: Expensive-ass wine
we could bust out with dinner.

3387
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:59,000
MATT: "Color me intrigued."

3388
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,030
LAURA: Oh, I haven't got to wink
in a really long time, you guys.

3389
02:49:01,030 --> 02:49:02,180
It felt so good.

3390
02:49:02,180 --> 02:49:04,220
MARISHA: Back to your old self.
LIAM: Hard life.

3391
02:49:04,220 --> 02:49:06,980
MATT: "It was a good wink.
Finest in the land.

3392
02:49:06,980 --> 02:49:09,800
"Well, come to the surface, then!
This place is dreary."

3393
02:49:09,800 --> 02:49:11,000
TALIESIN: Yes.

3394
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
MATT: "You, too, Eskil."

3395
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:16,000
MATT: "Aye.

3396
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:20,750
"Too many smiles
in this area. I like it. It's jovial.

3397
02:49:20,750 --> 02:49:23,000
"Don't see that
around these places too often.

3398
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,730
"It's good to see all of you.
Come, now, yes, let's move!"

3399
02:49:25,730 --> 02:49:28,000
MATT: You all eventually make your way
back to the surface, to Whitestone.

3400
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,530
MARISHA: I go to Vex and Pike and go,

3401
02:49:30,530 --> 02:49:33,990
"Is this a good opportunity
for us to break out our formal wear?"

3402
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,470
ASHLEY: (gasps) Yes!
LAURA: Definitely, dear.

3403
02:49:36,470 --> 02:49:38,500
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Oh, jeez.

3404
02:49:38,500 --> 02:49:41,020
TALIESIN: I genuinely have no idea
what you're talking about.

3405
02:49:41,020 --> 02:49:43,240
MARISHA: The ladies take, 
like, 20 minutes.

3406
02:49:43,240 --> 02:49:46,520
TRAVIS: Let's be honest, it's 2 hours.
TALIESIN: 40 minutes.

3407
02:49:46,520 --> 02:49:50,000
TRAVIS: Fucking 20 minutes, my ass.

3408
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,180
On what plane are you 
right now? (laughs)

3409
02:49:52,180 --> 02:49:54,000
LAURA: (laughs)

3410
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:55,500
MARISHA: Not the Feywild. 
But maybe soon.

3411
02:49:55,500 --> 02:49:57,000
ASHLEY: There's magic involved.

3412
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
TALIESIN: Same plane as the break room.
5 minutes is 15. (laughs)

3413
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:02,000
MARISHA: (laughing) Yes, yes, yeah.

3414
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:07,000
TRAVIS: "I'll be 20 minutes."
The next day...

3415
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
LIAM: On the way out,
as we're all walking out,

3416
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:10,500
I walk along with Gilmore
and I give him

3417
02:50:10,500 --> 02:50:13,000
just a gentle shoulder.
Shoulder to shoulder. And say,

3418
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:18,000
"It's really good
to see you on your feet.

3419
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:22,000
"It's the best smile I've had in ages."

3420
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:26,000
MATT: "You and me both."

3421
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:27,500
LAURA: While we're getting ready,

3422
02:50:27,500 --> 02:50:31,000
I would like to talk to Pike

3423
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:34,000
about a certain proposal that happened.

3424
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
None of us have addressed it.

3425
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
ASHLEY: I know, because I just--

3426
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
LAURA: What happened?
ASHLEY: What should I do?

3427
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
LAURA: What did you tell him?
Did you tell him yes, did you tell him no?

3428
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:43,500
ASHLEY: I'm just so--

3429
02:50:43,500 --> 02:50:45,000
MARISHA: Hang on,
what exactly did he say, by the way?

3430
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
ASHLEY: I just said we'll circle back.

3431
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
LAURA: We'll circle back?
MARISHA: Circle back.

3432
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:50,500
LAURA: (laughing) How did he take that?

3433
02:50:50,500 --> 02:50:54,000
ASHLEY: I think he was fine with it.
He just understands that I just--

3434
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
MARISHA: Treat proposals
like we do our dungeons?

3435
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
(laughs) We circle back.

3436
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
ASHLEY: Isn't that the only way
to just treat all things?

3437
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
I guess, I don't know.
I don't know.

3438
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:05,000
MARISHA: (giggles)
LAURA: How do you feel about him, Pike?

3439
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:09,000
ASHLEY: I just don't know.
I just feel so confused.

3440
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
MARISHA: I understand that.

3441
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:14,000
ASHLEY: He wears you down a little.

3442
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
LIAM: (cracks up)

3443
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:19,020
ASHLEY: And there's 
something there, for him.

3444
02:51:19,020 --> 02:51:23,000
MARISHA: I don't know if that's
a good reason to say yes, though.

3445
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
ASHLEY: Oh, I don't know. 
He's just very charming.

3446
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:26,500
MARISHA AND LAURA: He is very charming.

3447
02:51:26,500 --> 02:51:29,000
LAURA: And I noticed,
he's becoming more charming.

3448
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
ASHLEY: Yes, I know!

3449
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:32,500
MARISHA: Yeah, what is with that?
I didn't know that was possible.

3450
02:51:32,500 --> 02:51:34,000
ASHLEY: How? I feel like
he goes to sleep

3451
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:35,500
and then the next morning 
he's like--

3452
02:51:35,500 --> 02:51:37,000
ASHLEY AND LAURA: Even more charming!

3453
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:38,000
LAURA: I don't understand it.

3454
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:39,500
ASHLEY: Why is that?
MARISHA: I don't know.

3455
02:51:39,500 --> 02:51:41,000
LAURA: Like, every once in a while
I look at him and I go:

3456
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:42,500
MARISHA: Yeah, no,
and then I feel really--

3457
02:51:42,500 --> 02:51:43,500
LAURA: No, but he's small,

3458
02:51:43,500 --> 02:51:44,500
but at the same time,
I'm kind of interested.

3459
02:51:44,500 --> 02:51:46,000
MARISHA: Right! And you kind of
think about it for a second

3460
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:47,000
and you entertain it,

3461
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:48,740
and then you feel really gross
about yourself.

3462
02:51:48,740 --> 02:51:50,000
LAURA: You feel like-- yeah!
ASHLEY: Yes! Yes.

3463
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:54,000
LAURA: But if you're actually interested,
then it's not gross at all.

3464
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,660
MARISHA: No! Of course it's not gross
if you're actually interested.

3465
02:51:56,660 --> 02:51:59,000
ASHLEY: I know. I just. (groans)

3466
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
I've had feelings for someone
for a long time,

3467
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
but maybe they're slowly fading.
I don't know.

3468
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:06,000
LAURA: Wait.
MARISHA: Wait, what?

3469
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:10,000
ASHLEY: I have. I don't know
if I feel comfortable talking about it.

3470
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:11,500
But it's fine.

3471
02:52:11,500 --> 02:52:13,360
LAURA: We don't want to push you, Pike,
but you know, it's just us girls here.

3472
02:52:13,360 --> 02:52:18,000
MARISHA: I know! And we've been through
so many uncomfortable things together.

3473
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:19,150
ASHLEY: (groans)

3474
02:52:19,150 --> 02:52:21,000
MARISHA: Most of life
is so uncomfortable.

3475
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:24,000
Be comfortable right now.

3476
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
ASHLEY: I just. I don't know.

3477
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:30,000
It's still something
that I need to think about.

3478
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000
LAURA: All right.
MARISHA: We understand.

3479
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:33,500
ASHLEY: I'm just.

3480
02:52:33,500 --> 02:52:35,000
LAURA: You pray
to your Sarenrae about it.

3481
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
ASHLEY: Okay. (laughs)

3482
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:40,000
You do look lovely, though,
in your dress.

3483
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
LAURA: You look beautiful.
MARISHA: You look so cute.

3484
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
LAURA, ASHLEY, AND MARISHA: (laugh)

3485
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:45,500
ASHLEY: Thanks.
ASHLEY: I do a twirl.

3486
02:52:45,500 --> 02:52:47,000
(more laughter)

3487
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:50,000
MARISHA: I do a little air cantrip
to make the skirt poof out.

3488
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:53,000
ASHLEY: Ooh.
LAURA: I tug up my dress.

3489
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:57,000
MARISHA: Hey, do you guys mind
tying me up a bit?

3490
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
LAURA: Of course!
MARISHA: Nice and tight. (grunts)

3491
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:00,500
LAURA: Can you breathe?

3492
02:53:00,500 --> 02:53:01,890
MARISHA: (strained)
No, but that means it's right.

3493
02:53:01,890 --> 02:53:03,280
LAURA: All right.
MARISHA: All right, I'm good.

3494
02:53:03,280 --> 02:53:05,160
TALIESIN: I assume there's clean clothes 
for everybody in their quarters?

3495
02:53:05,160 --> 02:53:06,500
MATT: Yeah, it's all good.

3496
02:53:06,500 --> 02:53:08,000
TRAVIS: I'm wearing the same shit.

3497
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
(laughter)

3498
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:13,390
SAM: And the big hat?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3499
02:53:13,390 --> 02:53:16,500
MATT: (laughing) To dinner. (shoonk)

3500
02:53:16,500 --> 02:53:20,000
TRAVIS: (laughing) Yeah.
I paid money for this thing.

3501
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:23,020
TALIESIN: And I'm going to arrange
for our stuff to be stowed in the vault.

3502
02:53:23,020 --> 02:53:26,000
MATT: Okay. Not a worry.

3503
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:29,000
All right, so as the sun sets,

3504
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:33,000
you find your way down
to the proper dinner table.

3505
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:36,700
Gilmore is there, Eskil is there,
Cassandra is there...

3506
02:53:36,700 --> 02:53:39,000
MARISHA: We look fabulous.
MATT: You guys look fantastic.

3507
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:42,000
SAM: They do.
MARISHA: Yes. We do.

3508
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
MATT: Fine outfits have been provided
for the men,

3509
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
if they wish to wear them,
as well. Some do not.

3510
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:47,500
TALIESIN: Oh, I am dressed.
LIAM: I'm dressed, yeah.

3511
02:53:47,500 --> 02:53:49,000
SAM: Oh, I'll dress up.
I'll dress up for dinner.

3512
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:50,500
MATT: All righty.
As you guys sit down,

3513
02:53:50,500 --> 02:53:52,000
pleasantries are exchanged--

3514
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:53,500
(yawns) Pardon me.

3515
02:53:53,500 --> 02:53:55,970
You catch up a bit with Cassandra.
Partway through--

3516
02:53:55,970 --> 02:53:57,500
LAURA: Aw, Matt.

3517
02:53:57,500 --> 02:53:59,000
MATT: What?

3518
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:00,500
LIAM: E3, y'all.

3519
02:54:00,500 --> 02:54:05,000
TALIESIN: Sit down, have a beer, 
watch our game.

3520
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
MARISHA: (laughs) 2 pm.

3521
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
MATT: Within the next 15 minutes or so,

3522
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
before food is brought to the table,

3523
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:14,420
Allura finally enters
in a very, very nice dress, and says,

3524
02:54:14,420 --> 02:54:17,140
"It is so good
to see you all are safe."

3525
02:54:17,140 --> 02:54:18,880
MARISHA: Allura!
ASHLEY: Hello.

3526
02:54:18,880 --> 02:54:20,120
LAURA: I give her a hug.

3527
02:54:20,120 --> 02:54:21,940
MATT: She then gives you a big,
wonderful hug.

3528
02:54:21,940 --> 02:54:23,500
LAURA: How's Kima?
We haven't seen her yet.

3529
02:54:23,500 --> 02:54:24,490
MATT: "Well..."

3530
02:54:24,490 --> 02:54:26,180
She looks over this way
and Kima walks in,

3531
02:54:26,180 --> 02:54:27,590
for the first time you've seen her

3532
02:54:27,590 --> 02:54:30,000
really out of armor
since you first saw her.

3533
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:33,000
Her hair is also in similar braids
to her side

3534
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,740
and she herself is wearing
a golden dress,

3535
02:54:35,740 --> 02:54:38,000
though she's kind of like...

3536
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:39,500
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know the feeling.

3537
02:54:39,500 --> 02:54:41,000
(laughter)

3538
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
MATT: She comes in.

3539
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
MARISHA: Kima.
MATT: "Hello."

3540
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:46,500
ASHLEY: Oh, you look lovely.

3541
02:54:46,500 --> 02:54:49,000
MARISHA: Keyleth goes over
and gives her a hug.

3542
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:50,500
MATT: She gives you a hug and goes,

3543
02:54:50,500 --> 02:54:55,000
"It's good to see you guys.
I'm glad you're all right...

3544
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,500
"This feels weird. Does this feel weird?
This feels weird."

3545
02:54:57,500 --> 02:55:00,000
MARISHA: It's only for a few hours.
Don't worry about it.

3546
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:01,500
TRAVIS: What are you wearing?

3547
02:55:01,500 --> 02:55:03,000
MATT: "That's what I'm saying!
Do I have to wear--

3548
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
"he's not wearing anything.
Do I have to wear--"

3549
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:06,500
LAURA: You don't have to wear a dress, Kima.

3550
02:55:06,500 --> 02:55:09,500
MATT: "You don't have to wear it, Kima.
It was just a suggestion."

3551
02:55:09,500 --> 02:55:11,000
LAURA: (chuckles)

3552
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:12,500
MATT: "I'm going to go change.
I'll be right back."

3553
02:55:12,500 --> 02:55:13,500
TRAVIS: Yeah, go change.

3554
02:55:13,500 --> 02:55:15,900
MATT: She darts off for a bit
and Allura smiles and facepalms a bit.

3555
02:55:15,900 --> 02:55:17,140
SAM: You two are at the kiddie table.

3556
02:55:17,140 --> 02:55:18,950
(laughter)

3557
02:55:18,950 --> 02:55:22,000
LIAM: You ought to let her
try that helmet on later.

3558
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:23,500
SAM: Show some class, man.

3559
02:55:23,500 --> 02:55:25,000
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3560
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:26,500
MATT: You guys catch up a bit
as Allura speaks

3561
02:55:26,500 --> 02:55:32,000
about her and Drake's escape
from Westruun.

3562
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:36,000
Kima eventually comes back,
wearing ratty clothing.

3563
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:40,000
Shirt, pants, the general wear
she'd pick up throughout the city.

3564
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:44,000
And is still carrying
her small maul at her side.

3565
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:45,500
It's like her little comfort blanket.
(thud) Next to the table.

3566
02:55:45,500 --> 02:55:48,000
TRAVIS: Yeah. That's better.

3567
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:51,000
MATT: She scoots up next to Allura.

3568
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
Gilmore snaps his fingers

3569
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:57,000
and wine begins to pour
from the servants. Cassandra says,

3570
02:55:57,000 --> 02:56:00,000
"Well, thank you all for coming.

3571
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:04,000
"I believe there is much
to get underway here. This,"a

3572
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:09,000
MATT: And she gestures
towards Gilmore and Allura; they nod.

3573
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:13,000
Eskil raises his hand a moment.

3574
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:17,000
MATT: "So, while you've been gone.

3575
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,000
"Allura, you've been
doing this research for a bit."

3576
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:23,000
"Thank you, thank you.
So, we've been trying

3577
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:30,000
"to ascertain the nature
of the ziggurat beneath the city.

3578
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:33,000
"The ziggurat itself is built over

3579
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:37,000
"what appears to be
an ancient temple of Ioun.

3580
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
"The glass substance,

3581
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:43,000
"the diluted whitestone
that has been reformed into glass,

3582
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:47,000
"is used as a very strong arcane current.

3583
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:50,000
"A lot of energy was being placed
in this location,

3584
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:52,000
"as there is an actual,
what appears to be

3585
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:57,810
"an arcane leyline, a nexus point,

3586
02:56:57,810 --> 02:57:02,000
"near and above Whitestone,
hence the Sun Tree's placement."

3587
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:05,000
TALIESIN: Yes, of course.

3588
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:08,000
MATT: "And why it flourishes
so well in this region.

3589
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:12,000
"But everything within
a certain vicinity of this temple,

3590
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:19,000

3591
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:25,000
"Doesn't vanish, it's not cancelled,
it's taken. Devoured.

3592
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:30,580
"Everything placed within
that small little globule of darkness

3593
02:57:30,580 --> 02:57:34,000
"is taken somewhere as well.

3594
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,000
"Now, at first, we thought
maybe it was just destroying,

3595
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:39,000
"but the arcane energy we feel,

3596
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:43,000
"the flow of it,
it's drawing it somewhere.

3597
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:47,000
"Meaning that this is not
what I had feared to be

3598
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:50,000
"a sphere of annihilation,
an object of complete destruction.

3599
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,490
"Instead it feels like it's a siphon.

3600
02:57:55,000 --> 02:58:01,000
"Now, a siphon. Siphons are very old.
Siphons were used in the First War.

3601
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:04,000
"They were used as a means

3602
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:07,740
"of transferring extremely powerful...

3603
02:58:11,430 --> 02:58:14,000
"raw magical powers.

3604
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:17,000
"They were placed strategically
throughout the world's crust

3605
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,600
"at these various nexus points

3606
02:58:19,600 --> 02:58:23,000
"as a means of creating
extremely powerful relics.

3607
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:26,000
"The ones that you seek, the ones
that made the Vestiges themselves,

3608
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:31,000
"were crafted through the use
of some of these siphons,

3609
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:32,500
"but they have been lost and,
many thought,

3610
02:58:32,500 --> 02:58:37,000
"destroyed for a very long time,
or at least inert.

3611
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:40,000
"I have reason to believe
that this may be one.

3612
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:41,500
"And it may be active.

3613
02:58:41,500 --> 02:58:44,000
"As to where the other side lies,
I do not know.

3614
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:47,000
"Because each siphon has two points."

3615
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:50,000
TALIESIN: So it's fair to assume
that at the other end of this

3616
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:55,000
is something old, something trapped,
something hungry.

3617
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:56,500
MATT: "Perhaps."

3618
02:58:56,500 --> 02:58:59,000
LAURA: Would it be in this plane
or another?

3619
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:00,500
MATT: "I have no idea.

3620
02:59:00,500 --> 02:59:02,000
"Everything we've attempted
to put through it

3621
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:05,000
"that had any sort
of magical connection,

3622
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:08,000
"whether it be
through inter-planal scrying,

3623
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:10,000
"anything that would bring us
to the other side of this,

3624
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:14,000
"is crushed, consumed,
and transferred as part of it.

3625
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:15,500
"None of our rituals 
or enchantments

3626
02:59:15,500 --> 02:59:19,000
"will let us see through this
spinning marble, as you call it."

3627
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:21,000
LAURA: You haven't
put any blood through it, though?

3628
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:22,500
TALIESIN: Let's not.

3629
02:59:22,500 --> 02:59:24,000
LAURA: No, I'm hoping 
that hasn't happened.

3630
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:28,000
MARISHA: So nothing survives 
the transfer.

3631
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:33,000
It is destroyed into its...
purest components, it sounds.

3632
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:34,530
MATT: "Seemingly, yes."

3633
02:59:34,530 --> 02:59:36,000
LIAM: Or is it? Don't know?

3634
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:40,000
Is it that you have no idea
what happened to things put through?

3635
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:41,500
MATT: "We're still delving into it,

3636
02:59:41,500 --> 02:59:43,000
"and it may be a little while
before we figure this out,

3637
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:46,000
"but this is the best I can ascertain
with my knowledge at my disposal.

3638
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:51,690
"And the Realmseer and Gilmore
can back up this research.

3639
02:59:51,690 --> 02:59:53,500
"We've all worked together
these past weeks

3640
02:59:53,500 --> 02:59:57,000
"and we're all kind of
coming to the same conclusion."

3641
02:59:57,000 --> 03:00:01,000
She gestures to Gilmore.
Gilmore says,

3642
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:04,000
"I've only been
on this case personally

3643
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:06,990
"for a few days

3644
03:00:06,990 --> 03:00:12,000
"of rising health standards
in my body

3645
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:16,000
"and I've thrown everything
I can at it, honestly,

3646
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:19,000
"and it's all just come to nothing.
Gone. (pthbbt)"

3647
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:22,000
TALIESIN: This is disappointing.

3648
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:26,000
MATT: "You're telling me."
TRAVIS: What about a person?

3649
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:29,000
MATT: "(laughing) I'm not
sending a person through there."

3650
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:33,970
MARISHA: To be fair, Grog,
I might have tried that, a little.

3651
03:00:33,970 --> 03:00:36,000
SAM: What?
TALIESIN: Yes, that's right.

3652
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:41,000
MARISHA: I sort of stuck my hand
in the spinning ball of death

3653
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:45,000
and let's just say

3654
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,000
I'm glad I'm still here
standing with you all.

3655
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:48,810
LAURA: Was it sucking you in?

3656
03:00:48,810 --> 03:00:52,040
MARISHA: It did a considerable 
amount of damage to my hand

3657
03:00:52,040 --> 03:00:56,000
and definitely felt
like it was sucking me in

3658
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:59,700
and I had to resist pretty hard.

3659
03:00:59,700 --> 03:01:01,500
But it seems like anything
that goes in that sphere

3660
03:01:01,500 --> 03:01:06,550
doesn't come out the other end intact.

3661
03:01:06,550 --> 03:01:09,000
LAURA: Gilmore-- any of you, Allura--

3662
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:16,000
have you experienced
any kind of draw toward the orb?

3663
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:20,000
Do you feel different,
having been around it for very long?

3664
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:24,000
MATT: Gilmore cocks a curious eye
to the Realmseer.

3665
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:25,500
The Realmseer thinks
and scratches his chin,

3666
03:01:25,500 --> 03:01:27,000
looks to Allura.

3667
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:30,210
Allura looks down at the table
with her arms crossed,

3668
03:01:30,210 --> 03:01:32,000
looks to Kima.

3669
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:35,000
Kima's finishing her big drink.

3670
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:38,020
"I stay away from it.
It creeps the hell out of me."

3671
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:45,000
"Not to my knowledge.
Do you think we should be worried?"

3672
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:46,500
LAURA: Well, I don't know.

3673
03:01:46,500 --> 03:01:51,000
I mean, it is a very strong relic
that we don't know how it works.

3674
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:53,000
MATT: "The difficulty
in our research

3675
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:56,000
"is most of our means of inspection
are, well,"

3676
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:59,000
LAURA: Up close and personal.
MATT: "Of arcane nature."

3677
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:00,500
TALIESIN: I was hoping
that perhaps we could talk

3678
03:02:00,500 --> 03:02:04,000
about some engineering possibilities
of finding ways

3679
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:07,000
that science can measure what it is
where magic cannot.

3680
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:09,000
Something safe.

3681
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:11,000
SAM: (scoffs) Science, Percy?

3682
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:15,000
TALIESIN: In this sense, as it stands.

3683
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:17,000
MATT: "We're open
to all possible suggestions.

3684
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:20,000
"We're kind of at the end of our rope
for the time being.

3685
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:25,000
"We may send a few of us
across the way to, well,

3686
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:28,000
"a few different places
for more information.

3687
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:30,000
"May do a bit
of traveling ourselves, it seems."

3688
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:33,000
TALIESIN: I'll sketch something
with my copious free time.

3689
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:36,000
MATT: "Hm. Please do."

3690
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:39,000
SAM: No dragons
have buzzed by here in our absence?

3691
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:41,000
MATT: They kind of
look to themselves.

3692
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:43,000
"None yet,
but we've been very careful.

3693
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:47,000
"We're in the process of installing
some semblance of,

3694
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:51,000
"(sighs) for lack of a better term,
sort of a screen.

3697
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:00,500
"The last thing we need

3698
03:03:00,500 --> 03:03:02,000
"is any of these dragons
finding their way up north

3699

"where you've kept all of us
and the refugees safe,

3700

to piss any of them off,

that maybe they're

3702
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:13,000
"not really looking
behind this curtain of cloud."

3703
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:16,000
TALIESIN: Any fortifications
would be helpful.

3704
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:20,570
LAURA: Don't dragons sort of
see past those things?

3705
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:25,000
MATT: "We're doing our best
to try and meet those standards."

3706
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:30,000
TALIESIN: I have another request
in that direction that might help.

3707
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:33,000
If there was a way
to spread the word in this city

3708
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:38,000
and amongst those who travel,
to not speak of us.

3709
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:44,000
We should probably not be hailed
in this city at all.

3710
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:46,000
Our names should be stricken
from any record of it.

3711
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:48,000
MATT: Allura leans forward 
on the table.

3712
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:50,000
"No, I see. You're right.

3713
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:52,000
"There is merit in that,
though it will be difficult.

3714
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:53,500
"Many here look up to you.

3715
03:03:53,500 --> 03:03:56,000
"They see you as the salvation
of this city.

3716
03:03:56,000 --> 03:04:00,000
"But I believe we can go about
and speak with them

3717
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:03,840
"and help instill the idea
that it's for the better good

3718
03:04:03,840 --> 03:04:08,000
"that you are not mentioned."

3719
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:10,000
TALIESIN: Best to be nameless,
at this point.

3720
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:13,000
MARISHA: It's for their own safety.
TALIESIN: It's for everybody's.

3721
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:15,000
LAURA: We-who-must-not-be-named.
SAM: The Unmentionables.

3722
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:17,000
TALIESIN: (cracks up)
You're a terrible person.

3723
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:18,500
LAURA: (gasps) I love it.

3724
03:04:18,500 --> 03:04:21,000
MARISHA: Yeah. My choice is
The Unmentionables. I like it.

3725
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:24,000
MATT: Allura says,
"I did find some research

3726
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:27,000
"on some of these Vestiges
you are seeking."

3727
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:29,000
TALIESIN: Oh!

"swallowed by a terrible tree."

3732
03:04:39,500 --> 03:04:42,000
LAURA: Yes, the Warden.

3733
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:45,000
MATT: "Is that the name of it?"
LAURA: The Wrath of the Fey Warden.

3734
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:46,500
MATT: "So you've found
some information yourself?"

3735
03:04:46,500 --> 03:04:48,000
LAURA: Just the name.

3736
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:51,920
SAM: And that it's
in the Feywild, but nothing more.

MATT: "(sighs) This tree that holds it,
it's a tree seeded by the betrayal

to have terrible thoughts.

What else has been banished
to the Fire Plane?

TRAVIS: The djinn?

3861
03:11:31,000 --> 03:11:32,500
TALIESIN: Well, I say this

3862
03:11:32,500 --> 03:11:36,000
because if I were to slowly
open the portal to the Fire Plane

3863
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:39,000
and power it and make it bigger
and bigger and bigger,

3864
03:11:39,000 --> 03:11:42,000
eventually it would be
a hole into that dimension

3865
03:11:42,000 --> 03:11:44,000
that's big enough
for a dragon to fit through,

3866
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:47,000
but still not big enough for me,

3867
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:49,830
so I need to keep eating,
to make it bigger.

LAURA: (gasps)

3869
03:11:52,220 --> 03:11:56,000
TALIESIN: And maybe they might
be looking for what's down there

3870
03:11:56,000 --> 03:12:00,000
so they can feed it
and make a bigger hole.

3871
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:03,000
Just a thought. It may be nothing.

3872
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:07,020
LAURA: You think there's something
bigger than Thordak in the Fire Plane?

It's a terrible thought.

something bigger than Thordak,

3875
03:12:13,000 --> 03:12:16,000
probably in the Fire Plane,

3876
03:12:16,000 --> 03:12:20,000
but the Fire Ashari closed the portal.

3877
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:22,000
TALIESIN: That may
not have been the portal.

3878

MARISHA: That was the portal

3879

that Thordak came out of.
It ripped apart my entire--

3880

TALIESIN: That may just be
where he escaped.

3881

That power may still be flowing.

3882

MARISHA: Well, Allura, how did you
lock him in the Fire Plane to begin with?

is that they cannot be removed.

"to find one of these in the plane

MARISHA: All right. So, that's all good.

3921
03:14:53,000 --> 03:14:56,000
But he did escape.

3922
03:14:56,000 --> 03:14:59,000
LAURA: Could he still
potentially have it inside of him?

3923
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:02,000
MARISHA: Exactly!
That was my question!

3924
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:06,260
SAM: Well, she asked it,
so, technically, it's hers.

3925
03:15:06,260 --> 03:15:10,630
MATT: She turns and you can see Gilmore's
sitting at the table like this.

"I got a very good close
at that dragon.

plenty of wine tonight; don't judge me."

ASHLEY: Expensive-ass wine.

3930
03:15:24,500 --> 03:15:26,000
TALIESIN: It's the best wine.

3931
03:15:26,000 --> 03:15:27,500
MATT: "It is very expensive,
fine wine."

3932
03:15:27,500 --> 03:15:29,000
TRAVIS: Mattâ€™s Vineyard is the best.

3933
03:15:29,000 --> 03:15:31,320
MATT: "Thank you, Grog,
it's wondrous."

3934
03:15:31,320 --> 03:15:34,000
MARISHA: (laughs)

3935
03:15:34,000 --> 03:15:37,670
MATT: "But his mass,

that within his torso

TALIESIN: Look how clever
food makes all of us.

3942
03:16:04,000 --> 03:16:06,000
MATT: He looks over to Allura. 
Allura nods.

3943
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:08,000
"Well, if that is the case,
then it's, I think,

3944

"there's very much a chance

3945

"that he did escape
with the heart-stone intact."

3946
03:16:14,000 --> 03:16:17,000
TRAVIS: I have a question.

3947
03:16:17,000 --> 03:16:19,000
We've got one of the Vestiges

3948
03:16:19,000 --> 03:16:24,000
in these Titanstone Knuckles,
made from the heart-stone.

3949
03:16:24,000 --> 03:16:27,000
If I left the plane with these,

3950
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:30,120
are they gonna blow everybody up?

3951
03:16:30,120 --> 03:16:35,000
MATT: "An intact heart-stone
is the true source of power.

3952
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:38,610
"Those have been carved from one,
an inert one, or, at least,

3953

"they carry but a smidgen of the power.

3954

"I think you're safe, Grog."

3955
03:16:42,000 --> 03:16:45,000
TRAVIS: Oh, thank god.
ASHLEY: Phew.

3956
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:47,000
LAURA: Which one?

3957
03:16:47,000 --> 03:16:50,500
TRAVIS: Kord.
LAURA: Oh, Kord. I got it. (chuckles)

3958
03:16:50,500 --> 03:16:51,970
MATT: Allura leans in again.

3959
03:16:51,970 --> 03:16:57,000
"I have been keeping an eye on Emon
from this distance, as well.

"It seems that Thordak's very essence

"twists the land with elemental magic."

3962

TRAVIS: (whispering) Oh, shit.

MATT: "My distant views of the city

"have shown the center of the town

beneath the city itself."

TALIESIN: (whispering) Fuck.
LAURA: Oh, fuck.

3967

TRAVIS: Wait, why is he
digging and burrowing?

3968

LIAM: He's reshaping the land
as he sees fit.

3969
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:22,500
TRAVIS: Or is he looking for something?
LAURA: Because he's a dick.

3970

TRAVIS: Is he not
looking for something?

3971

TALIESIN: He might be
looking for something,

3972

or might be making--

3973
03:17:27,500 --> 03:17:29,000
MARISHA: So these heart-stones

3974
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:33,310
embrace the essence 
of where they reside?

3975

MATT: "Their essence
is created where they reside."

3976

MARISHA: And he has the heart-stone
of the Fire Elemental Plane

3977
03:17:42,860 --> 03:17:45,000
living inside of him.

3978
03:17:45,000 --> 03:17:51,000
MATT: "A heart-stone. There are many."
MARISHA: A heart-stone. Right.

3979
03:17:51,000 --> 03:17:52,500
LAURA: I'm confused.

3980
03:17:52,500 --> 03:17:54,000
TRAVIS: I need more wine.

3981
03:17:54,000 --> 03:17:55,500
Do you think he was
just making himself at home,

3982
03:17:55,500 --> 03:17:58,000
or do you think he was
looking for something?

3983
03:17:58,000 --> 03:18:00,500
MATT: "I don't know.
He seems pretty lax.

LAURA: Take over everything.

MATT: "Now they settle
into the divided territories

"to be content with just Emon.

3992

in his terrible design is."

3994
03:18:24,500 --> 03:18:26,000
MARISHA: So you're thinking

3995
03:18:26,000 --> 03:18:29,000
the Chroma Conclave
was simply a temporary alliance?

3996

MATT: "There are very few

"permanent alliances 
between chromatic dragons."

LAURA: Well, that's good.
MARISHA: We can use this.

3999
03:18:37,550 --> 03:18:40,000
LAURA: Maybe they won't take vengeance.

4000
03:18:40,000 --> 03:18:42,000
ASHLEY: Maybe we can get one of them
on our side.

4001
03:18:42,000 --> 03:18:44,000
TALIESIN: We can only be so hopeful
that they tear each other apart.

4002
03:18:44,000 --> 03:18:49,000
LAURA: Maybe the white one will want
to help kill Thordak with us.

4003
03:18:49,000 --> 03:18:53,000
MARISHA: Turning them against each other
is not a bad idea.

4004
03:18:53,000 --> 03:18:56,000
TALIESIN: Our best hope, at this point,
is just to amass power.

4005
03:18:56,000 --> 03:18:57,500
We are not strong enough.

4006
03:18:57,500 --> 03:18:59,000
LAURA: No.

4007
03:18:59,000 --> 03:19:01,000
TALIESIN: But we will get stronger.

4008
03:19:01,000 --> 03:19:05,500
LAURA: Does the heart-stone make him
even stronger than he already was?

4009

MATT: "I don't know,

4010

when we sealed him."

LAURA: Shit.
TRAVIS: Seize.

4012

MARISHA: So we can take-- yeah.

4013

LAURA: If we can pry it
out of his body,

4014
03:19:17,000 --> 03:19:18,500
we could shrink him down.

4015

Perfect plan.

4016
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:22,000
SAM: Then we could go
inside a dragon again.

4017

LAURA: We can go in another dragon.

one after the other.

TRAVIS: You seen any dragons
on the outskirts of the town?

4020

Have there been any flyovers
or close calls within, say,

4021
03:19:30,000 --> 03:19:34,500
50 to 100 miles or so?
Any reports?

TALIESIN: Unless they know
what's underneath the castle,

4029

there's nothing of value here.

4030

LIAM: Do we know where Vorugal
has taken up roost? No one knows?

MATT: "No. I've tried to scry,

protected against that now."

means of protection for Whitestone.

Do you have a defense planned?
A warning system?

4035
03:20:10,000 --> 03:20:12,500
MATT: "We're just getting now
to that point.

4036
03:20:12,500 --> 03:20:16,000
"It may be a few weeks
before we're ready to go.

4037
03:20:16,000 --> 03:20:18,000
"It's a lot to build
and it's a very big space to protect,

4038
03:20:18,000 --> 03:20:23,000
"but me and Drake
are working on some ideas. (sighs)"

4039
03:20:23,000 --> 03:20:25,870
MARISHA: Do you know exactly how
these heart-stones are forged?

4040
03:20:25,870 --> 03:20:30,000
MATT: "They're not forged.
They existed.

4041
03:20:30,000 --> 03:20:32,000
"They were the hearts
of the primordial titans

4042
03:20:32,000 --> 03:20:35,000
"that existed on this world
before the gods even came here."

4043
03:20:35,000 --> 03:20:37,000
MARISHA: Oh, that's right.
LAURA: Wow.

4044
03:20:37,000 --> 03:20:40,120
MATT: "They were the true denizens
of this world, before any of us."

4045
03:20:44,000 --> 03:20:48,000
SAM: This is an awesome dinner,
by the way. Super good.

4046
03:20:48,000 --> 03:20:51,000
LAURA: So good.
TALIESIN: I love game meat.

4047
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:55,000
MATT: "I'm sorry,
it's been a very tense time."

4048
03:20:55,000 --> 03:20:58,000
LAURA: This wine is pretty good.
ASHLEY: It's very good.

4049
03:20:58,000 --> 03:21:01,000
MATT: "Perhaps rest is in order
for all of us.

4050
03:21:01,000 --> 03:21:03,580
"It's been a lot. I'm so sorry.
It's good to see all of you."

4051
03:21:03,580 --> 03:21:05,220
TRAVIS: You, as well.
LAURA: You've done so much.

4052
03:21:05,220 --> 03:21:08,000
MATT: Allura brightens up a little bit.
You can see that she feels guilty

4053
03:21:08,000 --> 03:21:10,000
that she just did
this information dump and is like,

4054
03:21:10,000 --> 03:21:13,000
"(sighs) It's good
to see all of you."

4055
03:21:13,000 --> 03:21:15,000
MARISHA: It was good to see you.

4056
03:21:15,000 --> 03:21:17,000
MATT: "(sighs) Well,
let us rest for the evening."

4057
03:21:17,000 --> 03:21:19,500
Drinks the last of her wine,
stands up.

4058
03:21:19,500 --> 03:21:21,000
"We'll talk on the morrow."

4059
03:21:21,000 --> 03:21:23,000
She gets up. "Kima?"

4060
03:21:23,000 --> 03:21:25,000
"I'm coming, let me finish."

4061
03:21:25,000 --> 03:21:27,000
LAURA AND MARISHA: (laugh)

4062
03:21:27,000 --> 03:21:29,000
MATT: "No, seriously,
it's good to see you all.

4063
03:21:29,000 --> 03:21:30,500
"I'm glad you're all right."

4064
03:21:30,500 --> 03:21:32,150
LAURA: You should have been with us.

4065
03:21:32,150 --> 03:21:34,590
MATT: "I should've been with you.
I didn't know you left!"

4066
03:21:34,590 --> 03:21:36,500
LAURA: Sorry, Kima. We're dicks.

4067
03:21:36,500 --> 03:21:38,000
MATT: "Is Westruun okay?"

4068
03:21:38,000 --> 03:21:40,790
LAURA: It's... better.

4069
03:21:40,790 --> 03:21:43,000
MARISHA: (whispering)
It's not great, though.

4070
03:21:43,000 --> 03:21:46,000
LAURA: It's getting better.
TALIESIN: It lives. It lives.

4071
03:21:46,000 --> 03:21:48,500
SAM: That's true.
MARISHA: It stands.

4072
03:21:48,500 --> 03:21:50,420
MATT: "Does my house still stand?"

4073
03:21:50,420 --> 03:21:53,000
(hesitant noises)

4074
03:21:53,000 --> 03:21:56,500
SAM: What's a house, really,
but a bunch of bricks.

4075
03:21:56,500 --> 03:21:58,000
MATT: "Oh, it's fine."

4076
03:21:58,000 --> 03:22:00,410
MARISHA: Home is
where you make it, Kima.

4077
03:22:00,410 --> 03:22:03,560
MATT: "Object impermanence.
(glug glug)

4078
03:22:03,560 --> 03:22:06,500
"Next time you're going there,
you tell me."

4079
03:22:06,500 --> 03:22:08,000
LAURA: Oh, yes. We will.

4080
03:22:08,000 --> 03:22:10,000
TALIESIN: We will be returning.

4081
03:22:10,000 --> 03:22:13,000
TRAVIS: On one condition.
Don't wear any more dresses.

4082
03:22:13,000 --> 03:22:15,000
LAURA: (laughs)

4083
03:22:15,000 --> 03:22:18,220
MATT: "You saying
I wasn't pretty, Grog?"

4084
03:22:18,220 --> 03:22:21,090
TRAVIS: I like you
in your armor better.

4085
03:22:21,090 --> 03:22:23,000
MATT: "That's why I missed you."

4086
03:22:23,000 --> 03:22:25,000
She reaches out
and smacks your cheek.

4087
03:22:25,000 --> 03:22:27,000
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4088
03:22:27,000 --> 03:22:29,000
(laughter)

4089
03:22:29,000 --> 03:22:32,000
MATT: "All right, kiddies,
sleep it is."

4090
03:22:32,000 --> 03:22:35,000
Kima gets up and joins Allura,
and they both leave.

4091
03:22:35,000 --> 03:22:40,000
Gilmore stands up,
Realmseer stands up.

4092
03:22:40,000 --> 03:22:46,000
"All right, everyone.
Rest well. See you in the morning.

4093
03:22:46,000 --> 03:22:48,970
"And, ah, glad you're all safe."

4094
03:22:48,970 --> 03:22:52,670
LIAM: Good night, Shaun.
MATT: "Good night, everyone."

4095
03:22:52,670 --> 03:22:54,350
ASHLEY: Good night, Gilmore.
MATT: "Sleep well."

4096
03:22:54,350 --> 03:22:57,000
MATT: They all leave.

4097
03:22:57,000 --> 03:22:59,000
SAM: So we rest here
for a night or two

4098
03:22:59,000 --> 03:23:01,000
and then, to the Feywild?

4099
03:23:01,000 --> 03:23:02,500
TRAVIS: Yeah, Feywild.

4100
03:23:02,500 --> 03:23:04,000
SAM: Or to the--

4101
03:23:04,000 --> 03:23:10,500
TRAVIS: We even have a geographic--
demographic location to like--

4102
03:23:10,500 --> 03:23:12,000
SAM: True.
MARISHA: We do.

4103
03:23:12,000 --> 03:23:14,470
TALIESIN: I feel like 
the Feywild calls to us.

4104
03:23:14,470 --> 03:23:17,000
LIAM: What do you say
we go get you a new bow?

4105
03:23:17,000 --> 03:23:19,500
LAURA: We could go get me a new bow.
There's also the ocean.

4106
03:23:19,500 --> 03:23:20,500
SAM: Yeah.

4107
03:23:20,500 --> 03:23:23,160
LIAM: Nah. Let's get you a bow.
MARISHA: Let's go get you a bow.

4108
03:23:23,160 --> 03:23:25,190
ASHLEY: I'm going
to pour another glass of wine.

4109
03:23:25,190 --> 03:23:27,000
TALIESIN: Ocean next.

4110
03:23:27,000 --> 03:23:30,000
SAM: Pike could go off
to get the ocean one herself.

4111
03:23:30,000 --> 03:23:33,000
LAURA: No! You're crazy.
LIAM: That's a shitty idea.

4112
03:23:33,000 --> 03:23:35,000
MATT: (laughs)

4113
03:23:35,000 --> 03:23:37,500
TRAVIS: I think you've had
too much to drink, Scanlan.

4114
03:23:37,500 --> 03:23:39,420
LAURA: Or the two of you together.

4115
03:23:39,420 --> 03:23:42,490
SAM: Yeah, I like the ocean.
I don't really like the ocean.

4116
03:23:42,490 --> 03:23:44,500
(laughter)

4117
03:23:44,500 --> 03:23:46,000
MATT: You guys all going to rest?

4118
03:23:46,000 --> 03:23:47,500
MARISHA: I have one thing I'd like to do.

4119
03:23:47,500 --> 03:23:49,000
MATT: Okay, what do you want to do?

4120
03:23:49,000 --> 03:23:51,000
MARISHA: I want to go back

4121
03:23:51,000 --> 03:23:53,500
to our little cave that we dug out
under where the Sun Tree is.

4122
03:23:53,500 --> 03:23:55,000
Is that still there?

4123
03:23:55,000 --> 03:23:56,500
MATT: Yeah, it's still there.

4124
03:23:56,500 --> 03:23:58,000
MARISHA: I want to go there,

4125
03:23:58,000 --> 03:24:01,000
and I want to kind of sit down
and meditate for a second.

4126
03:24:01,000 --> 03:24:07,000
And I want to cast Speak With Plants

4127
03:24:07,000 --> 03:24:11,000
and have a little chat
with the Sun Tree.

4128
03:24:11,000 --> 03:24:14,000
MATT: Okay. (laughs)
You cast the spell,

4129
03:24:14,000 --> 03:24:16,000
you reach out
and touch the roots of the tree,

4130
03:24:16,000 --> 03:24:18,230
the roots of which have more color
than they did before.

4131
03:24:18,230 --> 03:24:22,000
The dull gray has become
more of a full brown.

4132
03:24:22,000 --> 03:24:26,000
The earth here smells of fresh,
damp earth.

4133
03:24:26,000 --> 03:24:28,900
The tree, while still
in the winter phase,

4134
03:24:28,900 --> 03:24:34,000
is definitely teeming with life,
to where it once didn't.

4135
03:24:34,000 --> 03:24:36,000
MARISHA: I reach out
and I touch the roots.

4136
03:24:36,000 --> 03:24:41,000
Can I just kind of feel,
sense the arcane ley-lines

4137
03:24:41,000 --> 03:24:46,000
that Allura was talking about
that the tree's in the center of?

4138
03:24:46,000 --> 03:24:51,000
MATT: Mmm... not really.

4139
03:24:51,000 --> 03:24:56,550
In speaking to the tree,
you can ask questions,

4140
03:24:56,550 --> 03:25:00,000
but you're not quite--

4141
03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:02,000
you find yourself unable
to tune into that

4142
03:25:02,000 --> 03:25:06,000
or tap into that source of magic.

4143
03:25:06,000 --> 03:25:08,000
At this place, at least.

4144
03:25:08,000 --> 03:25:12,530
MARISHA: Okay. So I just reach out,
touch the tree, and say,

4145
03:25:12,530 --> 03:25:17,780
"Hey, old friend.

4146
03:25:17,780 --> 03:25:22,000
"How are you feeling? Doing better?"

4147
03:25:22,000 --> 03:25:25,080
MATT: "Hey, bud. Much better."

4148
03:25:25,080 --> 03:25:27,000
(laughter)

4149
03:25:27,000 --> 03:25:29,000
MARISHA: You're pretty cool, Sun Tree.

4150
03:25:29,000 --> 03:25:30,500
MATT: "Sun Tree, A-OK."

4151
03:25:30,500 --> 03:25:37,000
(laughter)

4152
03:25:37,000 --> 03:25:39,000
MARISHA: Hey, Sun Tree?

4153
03:25:39,000 --> 03:25:44,000
MATT: "Yeah?"

4154
03:25:44,000 --> 03:25:47,000
MARISHA: I was just wondering
if you knew--

4155
03:25:47,000 --> 03:25:49,000
if you could tell me anything
about this

4156
03:25:49,000 --> 03:25:51,000
terrible cancerous tree
in the Feywild,

4157
03:25:51,000 --> 03:25:52,500
if you knew anything about it?

4158
03:25:52,500 --> 03:25:54,000
He might be like
your brother or something.

4159
03:25:54,000 --> 03:25:55,500
MATT: "Tree cancer? What?"

4160
03:25:55,500 --> 03:25:57,000
MARISHA: No! No, okay.

4161
03:25:57,000 --> 03:26:01,000
There's this tree in the Feywild
and it might have

4162
03:26:01,000 --> 03:26:05,000
a man living in it
called Fenthras.

4163
03:26:05,000 --> 03:26:06,500
TRAVIS: (quietly) The bow.

4164
03:26:06,500 --> 03:26:08,630
MARISHA: No, sorry,
that's the name of the bow,

4165
03:26:08,630 --> 03:26:14,000
the bow is in it, named Fenthras,
and it might be a really sick tree.

4166
03:26:14,000 --> 03:26:17,020
Can you tell me where there's
a really sick tree, maybe in the Feywild?

4167
03:26:17,020 --> 03:26:19,000
MATT: "That sounds sad, but no.

4168
03:26:19,000 --> 03:26:21,000
"I don't know
a tree like that, sorry.

4169
03:26:21,000 --> 03:26:23,000
"I've been here in Whitestone
since day one."

4170
03:26:23,000 --> 03:26:26,000
(laughter)

4171
03:26:26,000 --> 03:26:30,000
LIAM: Want to play hacky sack?
TALIESIN: Born and raised.

4172
03:26:30,000 --> 03:26:32,810
MATT: So I graduated from Berkeley
and made my way to Whitestone.

4173
03:26:32,810 --> 03:26:34,000
(laughter)

4174
03:26:34,000 --> 03:26:35,960
TRAVIS: My twigs smoke the doob.

4175
03:26:35,960 --> 03:26:38,000
SAM: "Barkeley."
MARISHA: "Barkeley!"

4176
03:26:38,000 --> 03:26:39,500
ASHLEY: Put a pair of Birkenstocks
on its branches.

4177
03:26:39,500 --> 03:26:41,000
TRAVIS: "Birkenstalks."
MATT: (groans)

4178
03:26:41,000 --> 03:26:42,820
LAURA: "Birkenstalks?" I like it.

4179
03:26:42,820 --> 03:26:44,380
MARISHA: Hey, Sun Tree?

4180
03:26:44,380 --> 03:26:46,220
MATT: "Yeah?"

4181
03:26:49,000 --> 03:26:51,000
MARISHA: You apparently kind of live

4182
03:26:51,000 --> 03:26:55,000
in the middle of all these
arcane ley-lines of the world.

4183
03:26:55,000 --> 03:26:57,500
MATT: "Yeah."
TALIESIN: (cracks up)

4184
03:26:57,500 --> 03:26:59,000
MARISHA: How far do those stretch?

4185
03:26:59,000 --> 03:27:03,000
MATT: "Long way, Kiki.

4186
03:27:03,000 --> 03:27:07,000
"Long way."

4187
03:27:07,000 --> 03:27:10,000
(laughter)

4188
03:27:10,000 --> 03:27:12,500
MARISHA: Can you kind of give me
a rough idea?

4189
03:27:12,500 --> 03:27:14,830
Do they go
to the other side of the world?

4190
03:27:14,830 --> 03:27:18,000
Can you stretch all over the world?

4191
03:27:18,000 --> 03:27:22,000
MATT: "Nah, just right here.
Pelor put me here for a reason."

4192
03:27:22,000 --> 03:27:25,000
MARISHA: Who? Pelor?
MATT: "Yeah."

4193
03:27:25,000 --> 03:27:27,000
MARISHA: Right.

4194
03:27:27,000 --> 03:27:31,100
So you're not a natural tree,
you're a tree from the gods?

4195
03:27:32,550 --> 03:27:33,880
MATT: "Sure."

4196
03:27:35,000 --> 03:27:38,000
MARISHA: All right.

4197
03:27:38,000 --> 03:27:40,740
Well, anyway,
you're really awesome, Sun Tree.

4198
03:27:40,740 --> 03:27:42,670
MATT: "Speak for yourself, Kiki."

4199
03:27:42,670 --> 03:27:46,000
MARISHA: Yeah, you're so cool.

4200
03:27:46,000 --> 03:27:48,000
Okay, so it was good talking to you.

4201
03:27:48,000 --> 03:27:49,980
MATT: "You, too."

4202
03:27:51,170 --> 03:27:54,000
MARISHA: I'll walk through you soon.
Okay, bye.

4203
03:27:54,000 --> 03:27:56,000
MATT: (laughs)

4204
03:27:56,000 --> 03:27:57,500
MARISHA: And then I leave.
MATT: All right.

4205
03:27:57,500 --> 03:28:00,830
LAURA: I want to make a once-over on Vax
and make sure that--

4206
03:28:00,830 --> 03:28:02,800
So you did,
you got all the blood off, then?

4207
03:28:02,800 --> 03:28:04,200
LIAM: What are you doing?
Yeah, I took a bath.

4208
03:28:04,200 --> 03:28:05,500
LAURA: I mean,
we got all cleaned up for tonight.

4209
03:28:05,500 --> 03:28:07,000
I just want to make sure
you didn't ruin it

4210
03:28:07,000 --> 03:28:09,000
by keeping some of the blood
in your freaking hair.

4211
03:28:09,000 --> 03:28:11,440
LIAM: Don't I look all right?
I'm fine! What's your problem?

4212
03:28:11,440 --> 03:28:13,830
LAURA: Nothing! Just making sure
you're doing all right.

4213
03:28:13,830 --> 03:28:15,000
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: All the blood's gone.

4214
03:28:15,000 --> 03:28:17,000
LIAM: Yeah. It's all gone.
LAURA: You're great.

4215
03:28:17,000 --> 03:28:19,000
LIAM: I'm doing much better.
LAURA: Good.

4216
03:28:19,000 --> 03:28:22,000
LIAM: Much better.

4217
03:28:22,000 --> 03:28:23,500
You ready for the Feywild?

4218
03:28:23,500 --> 03:28:28,000
LAURA: Fuck, no, not ready,
but we can do it.

4219
03:28:28,000 --> 03:28:29,420
LIAM: Oh.

4220
03:28:32,000 --> 03:28:34,000
TALIESIN: Stupid to settle.
MARISHA: (snorts)

4221
03:28:34,000 --> 03:28:35,500
LAURA: I walk over to Percy.

4222
03:28:35,500 --> 03:28:37,000
TALIESIN: I was about
to walk out the door,

4223
03:28:37,000 --> 03:28:39,000
but if you're walking--

4224
03:28:39,000 --> 03:28:42,000
LAURA: Before you leave,
I whisper in your ear,

4225
03:28:42,000 --> 03:28:44,000
"You still have
a little blood behind your ear."

4226
03:28:44,000 --> 03:28:45,000
TRAVIS: (gasps)

4227
03:28:45,000 --> 03:28:47,630
TALIESIN: Do you want 
to take a walk with me?

4228
03:28:47,630 --> 03:28:53,000
LAURA: (sighs) Sure.

4229
03:28:53,000 --> 03:28:55,000
TALIESIN: We take a very quiet walk
around Whitestone.

4230
03:28:55,000 --> 03:28:56,500
I want to pass all of the temples

4231
03:28:56,500 --> 03:29:01,000
that are either
still standing or destroyed.

4232
03:29:01,000 --> 03:29:03,000
I just want to take a temple tour.

4233
03:29:03,000 --> 03:29:05,980
Not stopping, not talking,
I just want to see what they look like.

4234
03:29:05,980 --> 03:29:10,000
Pelor looks good.
The one in the cemetery?

4235
03:29:10,000 --> 03:29:12,000
MATT: The one in the cemetery
is still under construction.

4236
03:29:12,000 --> 03:29:14,000
That one needs a little more work.

4237
03:29:14,000 --> 03:29:16,000
TALIESIN: While in the cemetery--

4238
03:29:16,000 --> 03:29:19,000
I assume that it's still a mess.

4239
03:29:19,000 --> 03:29:21,000
MATT: Most of the graves
have been refilled,

4240
03:29:21,000 --> 03:29:23,000
the corpses have been brought back.

4241
03:29:23,000 --> 03:29:27,000
Most of the dead that were brought forth
from the previous owners

4242
03:29:27,000 --> 03:29:28,500
have been returned.

4243
03:29:28,500 --> 03:29:30,000
That was one of the first
orders of business

4244
03:29:30,000 --> 03:29:32,000
that people who live here did,

4245
03:29:32,000 --> 03:29:34,000
was to return their families
to the earth.

4246
03:29:34,000 --> 03:29:37,400
TALIESIN: There were
a couple of lords' crypts in there.

4247
03:29:37,400 --> 03:29:41,000
Was there an Anders family crypt, 
at one point?

4248
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:43,000
MATT: There would have been, yeah.

4249
03:29:43,000 --> 03:29:45,000
TALIESIN: Cool. All right.

4250
03:29:45,000 --> 03:29:47,460
I'm going to walk back to the castle,

4251
03:29:47,460 --> 03:29:50,000
with you in tow,
and I'm going to find Zahra.

4252
03:29:50,000 --> 03:29:53,000
MATT: Okay.

4253
03:29:53,000 --> 03:29:56,000
LAURA: Are you going to tell me
why you went and saw the Raven Queen?

4254
03:29:56,000 --> 03:29:57,500
TALIESIN: Yes. Come.

4255
03:29:57,500 --> 03:29:59,000
MATT: All right.

4256
03:29:59,000 --> 03:30:02,510
You come back to the study
where you originally found Zahra.

4257
03:30:02,510 --> 03:30:05,010
She's still there poring over books,
but is now half-asleep.

4258
03:30:05,010 --> 03:30:07,000
She has a little candle
that's starting to flicker out

4259
03:30:07,000 --> 03:30:10,000
and she has her feet up on the desk
and her tail's kind of curled up

4260
03:30:10,000 --> 03:30:13,000
and she's falling asleep
into the book as you walk in.

4261
03:30:13,000 --> 03:30:15,000
LAURA: (whispering) Dear--
MATT: "What?"

4262
03:30:15,000 --> 03:30:18,000
LAURA: We all need sleep sometimes, hon.

4263
03:30:18,000 --> 03:30:22,000
MATT: "Sleep's for the boring."

4264
03:30:22,000 --> 03:30:23,500
TALIESIN: I have a task for you,

4265
03:30:23,500 --> 03:30:30,000
if you have the time and energy
for something a bit quiet, but necessary.

4266
03:30:30,000 --> 03:30:32,000
MATT: "What do you ask, Percy?"

4267
03:30:32,000 --> 03:30:33,500
TALIESIN: I'm going to have
the deeds

4268
03:30:33,500 --> 03:30:38,000
to the Anders family crypt
transferred to your name.

4269
03:30:38,000 --> 03:30:40,000
I want you to clean it out.

4270
03:30:40,000 --> 03:30:43,000
Throw the bodies wherever;
he has disgraced himself.

4271
03:30:43,000 --> 03:30:46,000
Clean them.

4272
03:30:46,000 --> 03:30:48,000
And if you can,
if you can find people who can do it,

4273
03:30:48,000 --> 03:30:50,000
I want to very quietly,
in that crypt,

4274
03:30:50,000 --> 03:30:55,380
create a small shrine
to the Raven Queen.

4275
03:30:57,000 --> 03:30:58,500
This will help.

4276
03:30:58,500 --> 03:31:02,000
And I bring out
the vial of blood from the pit.

4277
03:31:02,000 --> 03:31:05,000
Perhaps they will know
what to do with that.

4278
03:31:05,000 --> 03:31:06,000
MATT: "Intriguing."

4279
03:31:06,000 --> 03:31:08,000
TALIESIN: But I would like her
to have a quiet mark in this city.

4280
03:31:08,000 --> 03:31:09,910
LAURA: Is this for you,
or for my brother?

4281
03:31:12,000 --> 03:31:16,000
TALIESIN: ...It's for your brother,
so that he can help us.

4282
03:31:16,000 --> 03:31:21,000
We're apparently all in this together.

4283
03:31:21,000 --> 03:31:23,560
LAURA: I give Percy a kiss on the cheek.

4284
03:31:23,560 --> 03:31:29,000
TALIESIN: Oh. Thank you.
MATT: "All right."

4285
03:31:29,000 --> 03:31:31,000
TALIESIN: We need all the help we can get.

4286
03:31:31,000 --> 03:31:34,000
MATT: "Very well.
I'm sure it can be done.

4287
03:31:34,000 --> 03:31:36,000
"I never owned a crypt before.
I'm excited."

4288
03:31:36,000 --> 03:31:38,000
LAURA: It's exciting. (laughs)

4289
03:31:38,000 --> 03:31:40,000
MATT: She takes the vial
and puts it on the table.

4290
03:31:40,000 --> 03:31:41,480
LAURA: I think it suits you.

4291
03:31:41,480 --> 03:31:45,000
TALIESIN: Tell anyone you'd like
where I went. It's not a secret.

4292
03:31:45,000 --> 03:31:47,510
I just wasn't ready to...

4293
03:31:50,000 --> 03:31:53,000
I don't think your brother--

4294
03:31:53,000 --> 03:31:55,000
I would hate for him
to think I'm competing.

4295
03:31:55,000 --> 03:31:57,500
I just had some questions.

4296
03:31:57,500 --> 03:31:59,000
LAURA: I won't tell anyone, Percy.

4297
03:31:59,000 --> 03:32:00,500
TALIESIN: Thank you.

4298
03:32:00,500 --> 03:32:02,000
LAURA: Your business is yours.

4299
03:32:02,000 --> 03:32:04,000
And mine, because I noticed. 
(chuckles)

4300
03:32:04,000 --> 03:32:05,000
MARISHA: (snorts)

4301
03:32:05,000 --> 03:32:09,000
TALIESIN: Thank you for noticing,
and... I'm trying hard

4302
03:32:09,000 --> 03:32:12,000
not to make it my business.

4303
03:32:12,000 --> 03:32:15,000
It's hard to remember sometimes.

4304
03:32:15,000 --> 03:32:18,000
TALIESIN: (sighs)
LAURA: (quietly) We're all family.

4305
03:32:18,000 --> 03:32:23,000
TALIESIN: That's awful, isn't it. 
(sighs)

4306
03:32:23,000 --> 03:32:25,000
I'm going to go to my room--

4307
03:32:25,000 --> 03:32:27,000
LAURA: Oh! Percy!
TALIESIN: Yes?

4308
03:32:27,000 --> 03:32:28,000
LAURA: Sorry.

4309
03:32:28,000 --> 03:32:30,000
If Zahra wanted to make
some dragon arrows,

4310
03:32:30,000 --> 03:32:33,000
could she use stuff here
in the castle?

4311
03:32:33,000 --> 03:32:35,390
TALIESIN: I'll talk to my sister
on the way out.

4312
03:32:35,390 --> 03:32:37,000
I'll write her a letter
and see if they can--

4313
03:32:37,000 --> 03:32:39,000
they may have to delve
into our materials for it,

4314
03:32:39,000 --> 03:32:41,000
but I think we're good.

4315
03:32:41,000 --> 03:32:42,000
LAURA: Yes.

4316
03:32:42,000 --> 03:32:45,000
TALIESIN: We'll talk about
using our materials for such a thing,

4317
03:32:45,000 --> 03:32:48,000
and I will talk to her about that.

4318
03:32:48,000 --> 03:32:50,000
LAURA: All right.

4319
03:32:50,000 --> 03:32:52,000
TALIESIN: I'm going to do
my little thing and if it works, great,

4320
03:32:52,000 --> 03:32:55,000
and if not,
we'll speak not of it for a while.

4321
03:32:55,000 --> 03:32:57,490
MATT: Okay. Go ahead
and make your tinkering check.

4322
03:33:00,000 --> 03:33:04,000
TALIESIN: Better! 30.

4323
03:33:04,000 --> 03:33:06,000
MATT: That'll do.

4324
03:33:06,000 --> 03:33:08,000
TALIESIN: I craft a brooch.

4325
03:33:08,000 --> 03:33:11,000
It's not even a brooch,
it's a clasp.

4326
03:33:11,000 --> 03:33:15,000
I had built these pieces of it
earlier on in the game.

4327
03:33:15,000 --> 03:33:17,000
For the last three weeks
I've been working on this.

4328
03:33:17,000 --> 03:33:20,000
I've taken the raven skull
that you gave me

4329
03:33:20,000 --> 03:33:22,000
and made a mold

4330
03:33:22,000 --> 03:33:25,000
and poured melted silver
into a bird skull,

4331
03:33:25,000 --> 03:33:26,500
a silver bird skull.

4332
03:33:26,500 --> 03:33:29,000
Taken a ruby and set it behind it,

4333
03:33:29,000 --> 03:33:33,000
built it into a clasp
that does not reflect,

4334
03:33:33,000 --> 03:33:38,000
and in it,
put a sachet of-- satchel...

4335
03:33:38,000 --> 03:33:40,000
MARISHA and LAURA: Sachet.

4336
03:33:40,000 --> 03:33:44,000
TALIESIN: Thank you. My brain? Coffee.

4337
03:33:44,000 --> 03:33:47,310
Of myrrh and--

4338
03:33:47,310 --> 03:33:49,000
SAM: Frankincense?

4339
03:33:49,000 --> 03:33:55,000
TALIESIN: (snorts and laughs)
Myrrh, sandalwood, opium,

4340
03:33:55,000 --> 03:33:58,000
and dragon's blood.

4341
03:33:58,000 --> 03:34:01,000
Not real dragon's blood,
but dragon's blood--

4342
03:34:01,000 --> 03:34:02,000
SAM: True blood.

4343
03:34:02,000 --> 03:34:04,000
TALIESIN: Sap. It's a sap.
It's a tree sap.

4344
03:34:04,000 --> 03:34:06,000
Put the whole thing together.

4345
03:34:06,000 --> 03:34:08,000
LIAM: You've had opium
this whole time and you never...

4346
03:34:08,000 --> 03:34:11,000
TALIESIN: It's not, it's just poppy.

4347
03:34:11,000 --> 03:34:12,500
LAURA: What does it do?

4348
03:34:12,500 --> 03:34:16,000
TALIESIN: You will find out
when I present it.

4349
03:34:16,000 --> 03:34:18,000
MATT: All right.
Everyone else going to rest?

4350
03:34:18,000 --> 03:34:21,000
TRAVIS: No.
I ran out of dinner super fast

4351
03:34:21,000 --> 03:34:23,000
and I ran outside of Vax's room

4352
03:34:23,000 --> 03:34:27,000
and I took the jug
and I whispered into it, "oil,"

4353
03:34:27,000 --> 03:34:30,000
and I poured one quart of oil

4354
03:34:30,000 --> 03:34:32,000
on the ground outside of his door.

4355
03:34:32,000 --> 03:34:34,000
Looked around real quick.

4356
03:34:34,000 --> 03:34:35,500
Is there anyone in the hallway?

4357
03:34:35,500 --> 03:34:37,440
MATT: Make a perception check.

4358
03:34:41,000 --> 03:34:42,500
TRAVIS: 10.

4359
03:34:42,500 --> 03:34:44,500
MATT: Looks clear.

4360
03:34:44,500 --> 03:34:45,490
TRAVIS: (giggles)

4361
03:34:45,490 --> 03:34:46,826
And I run away.

4362
03:34:46,826 --> 03:34:48,163
(laughter)

4363
03:34:48,163 --> 03:34:49,270
MATT: All righty.

4364
03:34:49,270 --> 03:34:51,500
LIAM: That was super awesome
and I can't wait to see the outcome,

4365
03:34:51,500 --> 03:34:53,000
but before that happens,

4366
03:34:53,000 --> 03:34:56,450
I was standing right here
when these two walked off,

4367
03:34:56,450 --> 03:35:03,000
so I am waiting in the exact same spot
for my sister to return.

4368
03:35:03,000 --> 03:35:04,500
MATT: A lot of time passes.
LIAM: It's fine.

4369
03:35:04,500 --> 03:35:06,000
MATT: A few hours pass
before she returns,

4370
03:35:06,000 --> 03:35:08,310
but she eventually does.

4371
03:35:08,310 --> 03:35:11,000
LAURA: Are you still here?
You should go to bed.

4372
03:35:11,000 --> 03:35:14,000
LIAM: I will.
I took a little bit of a nap.

4373
03:35:14,000 --> 03:35:16,000
LAURA: In the dining hall?

4374
03:35:16,000 --> 03:35:18,000
LIAM: Yeah.

4375
03:35:18,000 --> 03:35:19,740
LAURA: What?

4376
03:35:23,000 --> 03:35:25,960
LIAM: You're a grown-ass woman,
and you're twice as strong as I am.

4377
03:35:25,960 --> 03:35:26,830
LAURA: I know.

4378
03:35:26,830 --> 03:35:29,980
LIAM: So your business is your business.

4379
03:35:29,980 --> 03:35:34,460
Just... both eyes open, yeah?

4380
03:35:34,460 --> 03:35:40,590
LAURA: Always. (chuckles)
I'm very perceptive.

4381
03:35:42,000 --> 03:35:44,000
LAURA: (cackles)
LIAM: Don't do that to me.

4382
03:35:44,000 --> 03:35:45,960
TALIESIN: That's two.
Two winks! Ah hah hah.

4383
03:35:45,960 --> 03:35:48,490
LIAM: Please don't ever
do that to me again.

4384
03:35:48,490 --> 03:35:51,000
LAURA: I love you so much.

4385
03:35:51,000 --> 03:35:55,020
LIAM: And if you do, you will 
never use that wink on me again.

4386
03:35:55,020 --> 03:35:57,000
It is not for me.

4387
03:35:57,000 --> 03:35:58,560
LAURA: All right.

4388
03:35:58,560 --> 03:36:04,000
LIAM: Just... he's charming,
but both eyes open, please.

4389
03:36:04,000 --> 03:36:05,500
LAURA: I don't know
what you are talking about.

4390
03:36:05,500 --> 03:36:06,740
LIAM: Yeah, the fuck you don't.

4391
03:36:06,740 --> 03:36:10,020
I'm going to go to my room now
and see if I splat on the floor.

4392
03:36:10,020 --> 03:36:14,000
MATT: All right, make a perception check.

4393
03:36:14,000 --> 03:36:16,000
TRAVIS: Come on, big money, no whammies.

4394
03:36:16,000 --> 03:36:19,000
(laughter)

4395
03:36:19,000 --> 03:36:22,600
LAURA: Ohhh.
LIAM: Sorry, buddy, it's a 31.

4396
03:36:22,600 --> 03:36:25,000
MATT: As you approach the door,
you look down

4397
03:36:25,000 --> 03:36:28,000
and see a smear of dark,
reflective oil

4398
03:36:28,000 --> 03:36:33,000
across the walkway about two feet 
leading up to your room.

4399
03:36:33,000 --> 03:36:36,000
You guys have a cluster of rooms
in this long hallway,

4400
03:36:36,000 --> 03:36:38,000
and it arcs around like an L.

4401
03:36:38,000 --> 03:36:39,500
So you guys are in this big L

4402
03:36:39,500 --> 03:36:42,000
of all your rooms scattered throughout.

4403
03:36:42,000 --> 03:36:44,000
LIAM: How thick is it? Is it viscous?

4404
03:36:44,000 --> 03:36:48,000
MATT: Yeah, it's pretty slippery.
LIAM: Put my hand in it. Does that stay?

4405
03:36:48,000 --> 03:36:51,000
MATT: The hand stays for a minute, then--
LIAM: Goes away.

4406
03:36:51,000 --> 03:36:53,710
MATT: Yeah, it's pretty thick.
LIAM: All right.

4407
03:36:56,000 --> 03:36:59,000
MATT: Also has a fume to it.

4408
03:36:59,000 --> 03:37:00,000
LIAM: Okay.

4409
03:37:00,000 --> 03:37:02,000
I'm going to scrape
a bunch of it up just into my hand,

4410
03:37:02,000 --> 03:37:05,000
so I have a big handful of it,

4411
03:37:05,000 --> 03:37:08,000
and I'm just going
to go to Grog's room,

4412
03:37:08,000 --> 03:37:11,000
and I'm going to slowly,
just at the door, take time to write,

4413
03:37:11,000 --> 03:37:16,000
Grog smells

4414
03:37:16,000 --> 03:37:22,200
like farts and--

4415
03:37:22,200 --> 03:37:25,000
LAURA: I walk by him
as he's doing this and say,

4416
03:37:25,000 --> 03:37:27,000
You know he can't read, right?

4417
03:37:27,000 --> 03:37:29,000
MARISHA: (laughs)

4418
03:37:29,000 --> 03:37:31,000
LIAM: I picked specifically small words!

4419
03:37:31,000 --> 03:37:33,000
(laughter)

4420
03:37:33,000 --> 03:37:34,500
LIAM: Poo.

4421
03:37:34,500 --> 03:37:36,000
TALIESIN: Oh, he can read that.

4422
03:37:36,000 --> 03:37:37,000
LIAM: And I draw--

4423
03:37:37,000 --> 03:37:41,980
No. I'll tell you what I do.
Pull down my breeches

4424
03:37:41,980 --> 03:37:44,500
and I put the oil on my butt
and I go (squelch).

4425
03:37:44,500 --> 03:37:46,000
(laughter)

4426
03:37:46,000 --> 03:37:48,000
LIAM: A little signature.

4427
03:37:48,000 --> 03:37:51,050
MATT: All right. Well done.

4428
03:37:53,000 --> 03:37:55,000
TALIESIN: Preschoolers run amok
in my gentle abode.

4429
03:37:55,000 --> 03:37:59,000
LIAM: Get busy living
or get busy dying. Butt-print.

4430
03:37:59,000 --> 03:38:00,490
MATT: All right.
You guys all get into bed.

4431
03:38:00,490 --> 03:38:02,060
Anything else you want to get done?

4432
03:38:02,060 --> 03:38:04,600
SAM: I just told Pike
she looked real pretty tonight

4433
03:38:04,600 --> 03:38:06,950
and I go back to my reading.

4434
03:38:06,950 --> 03:38:08,000
MATT: Okay.

4435
03:38:08,000 --> 03:38:12,000
You guys all find yourselves
back to your respective rooms,

4436
03:38:12,000 --> 03:38:13,500
resting for the night.

4437
03:38:13,500 --> 03:38:17,180
Some doors
adorned differently than others.

4438
03:38:20,000 --> 03:38:22,000
Partway into the evening's resting,

4439
03:38:22,000 --> 03:38:27,000
we'll say the wee hours of the morning,
post-midnight or so,

4440
03:38:27,000 --> 03:38:31,570
your door opens slightly, Vax.

4441
03:38:34,000 --> 03:38:38,450
You hear a little
(knocking sound) on your door.

4442
03:38:39,440 --> 03:38:41,100
LIAM: Yes?

4443
03:38:41,100 --> 03:38:45,440
MATT: You look over and you see Gilmore
pop his head in with a soft smile.

4444
03:38:46,910 --> 03:38:51,600
"I'm sorry if I'm waking you up."

4445
03:38:52,880 --> 03:38:54,210
LIAM: It's all right.

4446
03:38:54,210 --> 03:38:55,460
MATT: "Here."

4447
03:38:55,460 --> 03:38:58,600
And he produces what looks like
a folded pile of material

4448
03:38:58,600 --> 03:39:01,330
and throws it
on the foot of your bed and goes,

4449
03:39:01,330 --> 03:39:04,590
"Come, Vax, I made you a gift.

4450
03:39:04,590 --> 03:39:08,030
"Put it on, come walk with me awhile.
We have a lot to talk about."

4451
03:39:08,030 --> 03:39:10,000
LIAM: I open it up.

4452
03:39:10,000 --> 03:39:15,000
MATT: It's a very well-crafted silk robe
of dark blue and black.

4453
03:39:15,000 --> 03:39:17,890
Beaded, nice against the skin.
It's really, really nice.

4454
03:39:17,890 --> 03:39:19,420
LIAM: (quietly) Give me a minute.

4455
03:39:19,420 --> 03:39:21,500
(louder) There's a wooden screen
in the room.

4456
03:39:21,500 --> 03:39:25,160
I go behind it
and wipe any oil left off my butt.

4457
03:39:25,160 --> 03:39:27,640
(laughter)

4458
03:39:27,640 --> 03:39:29,590
MATT: That's fantastic.

4459
03:39:29,590 --> 03:39:33,380
LIAM: Everything looks all right.
And I put it on.

4460
03:39:33,380 --> 03:39:37,030
MATT: All right. 
He waits for you patiently in the hallway.

4461
03:39:39,036 --> 03:39:45,013
So he begins walking along.
Puts his arm out to you.

4462
03:39:45,013 --> 03:39:46,220
LIAM: Take it.

4463
03:39:46,220 --> 03:39:49,500
MATT: You take his arm.
You guys walk up along the hallway.

4464
03:39:49,500 --> 03:39:53,350
He leads you to a staircase
that leads up further, and he goes,

4465
03:39:56,700 --> 03:39:59,500
"I know a lot has happened
these recent months.

4466
03:39:59,500 --> 03:40:01,680
"I've been watching from afar,

4467
03:40:01,680 --> 03:40:06,000
"keeping tabs on your journey
best that I can.

4468
03:40:06,000 --> 03:40:09,000
"But I still know so little."

4469
03:40:09,000 --> 03:40:11,000
You ascend the lengthy staircase

4470
03:40:11,000 --> 03:40:13,000
and you make your way
to the higher floor.

4471
03:40:13,000 --> 03:40:15,000
You eventually open
an intricate door

4472
03:40:15,000 --> 03:40:18,450
and walk out
onto a wide balcony on that tower

4473
03:40:18,450 --> 03:40:22,000
that overlooks the grounds
and the castle before you.

4474
03:40:22,000 --> 03:40:26,000
Beautiful moonlight, the night air.

4475
03:40:26,000 --> 03:40:29,000
You see the moon is nearly full
and the white light illuminates

4476
03:40:29,000 --> 03:40:33,000
the densely-forested countryside
surrounding the castle.

4477
03:40:33,000 --> 03:40:34,500
He closes the door

4478
03:40:34,500 --> 03:40:38,000
and walks up to you
at the edge of the balcony,

4479
03:40:38,000 --> 03:40:41,140
looking over it all,
elbows on the edge.

4480
03:40:43,820 --> 03:40:47,000
"Some time has passed, Vax.

4481
03:40:47,000 --> 03:40:50,630
"And much of the world
moves on to newer, greater threats.

4482
03:40:52,670 --> 03:40:55,430
"But true pain never really heals."

4483
03:40:59,320 --> 03:41:02,020
He turns to you

4484
03:41:02,020 --> 03:41:08,000
and steps up to you,
looking you close in the face.

4485
03:41:08,000 --> 03:41:14,000
"You hurt me deeply.
And continue to hurt.

4486
03:41:14,000 --> 03:41:20,350
"Agony, for weeks, months.

4487
03:41:20,350 --> 03:41:24,260
"Pain I had never experienced.

4488
03:41:24,260 --> 03:41:26,390
"(deepening to a growl)
It's all I can think about."

4489
03:41:26,390 --> 03:41:28,000
LIAM: Can I make an insight check?

4490
03:41:28,000 --> 03:41:31,000
MATT: You would, if you had time.

4491
03:41:31,000 --> 03:41:34,690
MARISHA: Oh my god!
LAURA: (gasps) I knew it. I knew it.

4492
03:41:34,690 --> 03:41:36,160
MARISHA: No!

4493
03:41:38,710 --> 03:41:41,700
MATT: The pain hits you suddenly,
before anything else does,

4494
03:41:41,700 --> 03:41:44,540
as you're lost in that face
and the sudden feeling,

4495
03:41:44,540 --> 03:41:48,080
the sensation 
of terror and horror.

4496
03:41:51,000 --> 03:41:56,050
You suffer 18 points

4497
03:41:56,880 --> 03:41:58,930
of piercing damage,

4498
03:42:01,000 --> 03:42:04,000
and I need you to make
a constitution saving throw.

4499
03:42:04,000 --> 03:42:06,610
LIAM: Oh, that's my specialty.

4500
03:42:08,650 --> 03:42:11,000
TALIESIN: (whispering) We don't know
what the hell this is.

4501
03:42:11,000 --> 03:42:13,840
LIAM: Constitution save?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

4502
03:42:13,840 --> 03:42:16,070
LIAM: 11.

4503
03:42:16,070 --> 03:42:18,000
MATT: You feel the poison--

4504
03:42:18,000 --> 03:42:20,640
LIAM: I'll use luck.
MATT: Roll again.

4505
03:42:23,000 --> 03:42:24,500
LIAM: 18.

4506
03:42:24,500 --> 03:42:28,000
MATT: You feel what should be
a pulse of poison hit your system

4507
03:42:28,000 --> 03:42:31,340
and you manage to fight it off
as suddenly you look down

4508
03:42:31,340 --> 03:42:36,000
and there is Gilmore
holding a blade thrust into your stomach,

4509
03:42:36,000 --> 03:42:41,000
your robes now beginning to fill
with crimson red around the wound.

4510
03:42:41,000 --> 03:42:46,890
It's at that moment you see him
pull you in and stare into your face

4511
03:42:46,890 --> 03:42:49,350
with a very low growl,

4512
03:42:49,350 --> 03:42:53,000
"It's all I think about."

4513
03:42:53,000 --> 03:42:55,000
And you watch
as a flicker to his form happens

4514
03:42:55,000 --> 03:42:58,000
and you see for a second
there's a flash: not skin, but fur.

4515
03:42:58,000 --> 03:43:00,000
You see teeth, you see whiskers,

4516
03:43:00,000 --> 03:43:03,410
and the hand holding the dagger
is facing the other direction.

4517
03:43:05,000 --> 03:43:06,500
That's where
we're going to end tonight's session.

4518
03:43:06,500 --> 03:43:08,500
(shocked exclamations)

4519
03:43:08,500 --> 03:43:11,000
MARISHA: Nooo!

4520
03:43:11,000 --> 03:43:13,000
LAURA: The rakshasa?
MARISHA: Is it a rakshasa?

4521
03:43:13,000 --> 03:43:16,000
MATT: (laughs)
LAURA: Oh my god.

4522
03:43:16,000 --> 03:43:18,000
TRAVIS: Ohhhh.

4523
03:43:18,000 --> 03:43:21,000
MATT: We'll be back next week.

4524
03:43:21,000 --> 03:43:22,500
LIAM: That fucked 
with my head, Matt.

4525
03:43:22,500 --> 03:43:25,000
LIAM: What are you doing?
TALIESIN: Wow.

4526
03:43:25,000 --> 03:43:26,700
MATT: What a rakshasa does.
SAM: Good job, man.

4527
03:43:26,700 --> 03:43:28,500
LAURA: Oh my god.
MARISHA: What the fuck?!

4528
03:43:28,500 --> 03:43:29,500
TALIESIN: Wow.

4529
03:43:29,500 --> 03:43:31,500
MARISHA: Has he been a rakshasa 
the whole time?

4530
03:43:31,500 --> 03:43:33,000
Wait, is it the rakshasa 
who's different?

4531
03:43:33,000 --> 03:43:35,000
Is it not Gilmore? 
So many questions!

4532
03:43:35,000 --> 03:43:38,000
LIAM AND MATT: (laugh)

4533
03:43:38,000 --> 03:43:42,500
MATT: Perhaps this will be revealed
next week as we kick in

4534
03:43:42,500 --> 03:43:44,000
at this very moment.

4535
03:43:44,000 --> 03:43:45,500
LAURA: Oh my god.

4536
03:43:45,500 --> 03:43:48,000
Why does it always leave off
when he's about to get killed?

4537
03:43:48,000 --> 03:43:49,500
MARISHA: Right!
Why is it always you?

4538
03:43:49,500 --> 03:43:51,630
SAM: Because he's always
almost about to die.

4539
03:43:51,630 --> 03:43:53,000
LIAM: This one did die!

4540
03:43:53,000 --> 03:43:54,500
TALIESIN: Because he runs
into all the rooms first

4541
03:43:54,500 --> 03:43:56,000
and he makes out with everybody.

4542
03:43:56,000 --> 03:43:58,000
LAURA: Because you do. That's the thing.
TALIESIN: That's why it happens.

4543
03:43:58,000 --> 03:44:01,000
TALIESIN: He runs into the rooms first
and he puts his tongue exciting places.

4544
03:44:01,000 --> 03:44:02,000
MARISHA AND LAURA: (laugh)

4545
03:44:02,000 --> 03:44:03,500
MATT: You also happened
to lean in real close--

4546
03:44:03,500 --> 03:44:05,000
TALIESIN: I'm not yelling at you, man.
I'm envious.

4547
03:44:05,000 --> 03:44:06,500
MATT: And whisper in the ear
of the rakshasa

4548
03:44:06,500 --> 03:44:08,000
as he slowly slit its throat
across the floor.

4549
03:44:08,000 --> 03:44:10,000
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right,
you did do that.

4550
03:44:10,000 --> 03:44:12,000
LAURA: Oh, so what did you do?
What did you do?

4551
03:44:12,000 --> 03:44:13,500
LIAM: I slit its throat, yeah.
MATT: Yeah.

4552
03:44:13,500 --> 03:44:15,000
LIAM: It's all right.
MARISHA: Hang on, wait.

4553
03:44:15,000 --> 03:44:17,110
MATT: It just wants to come back
and show you the same love.

4554
03:44:17,110 --> 03:44:18,570
MARISHA: Oh, wait,

4555
03:44:18,570 --> 03:44:22,010
did you get the final blow
in the rakshasa in the Slayer's Take?

4556
03:44:22,010 --> 03:44:23,500
LIAM: Yes, I did.
Yeah, I cut his throat.

4557
03:44:23,500 --> 03:44:25,000
LAURA: And you said
something shitty to him.

4558
03:44:25,000 --> 03:44:27,550
LIAM: He threatened my family
and I said,

4559
03:44:27,550 --> 03:44:29,000
"Say something 
about my sister again,"

4560
03:44:29,000 --> 03:44:30,500
and I slit his throat.

4561
03:44:30,500 --> 03:44:32,000
LAURA: Oh, nice!
MATT: Oh, boy.

4562
03:44:32,000 --> 03:44:33,570
TALIESIN: It's about to drop.

4563
03:44:33,570 --> 03:44:38,060
MARISHA: But he was dead.
What the fuck is going on?!

4564
03:44:38,060 --> 03:44:40,430
LAURA: Was he? Did you chop him up?

4565
03:44:40,430 --> 03:44:43,620
MARISHA: No, because I'm not a psycho.

4566
03:44:43,620 --> 03:44:45,000
SAM: This is exciting.

4567
03:44:45,000 --> 03:44:47,000
MATT: This will be interesting
next week when we kick in.

4568
03:44:47,000 --> 03:44:49,000
TALIESIN: There's a fine line
between psycho and practical.

4569
03:44:49,010 --> 03:44:52,000
MARISHA: I can see
chopping someone's body up

4570
03:44:52,000 --> 03:44:53,500
might be psycho.

4571
03:44:53,500 --> 03:44:55,000
TALIESIN: It's not psycho

4572
03:44:55,000 --> 03:44:57,000
if you drive a very small car
with not a lot of trunk space.

4573
03:44:57,000 --> 03:44:58,000
TRAVIS: Nicely done, Matt.
LAURA: Nice, Matt.

4574
03:44:58,000 --> 03:45:00,000
MATT: Guys, great game tonight.
LAURA: Thanks, guys.

4575
03:45:00,000 --> 03:45:03,000
TRAVIS: That Raven Queen, whoo.
LIAM: Whoo.

4576
03:45:03,000 --> 03:45:04,500
LAURA: That can be
the name of the episode:

4577
03:45:04,500 --> 03:45:07,000
Yas Queen.

4578
03:45:07,000 --> 03:45:09,000
(laughter)

4579
03:45:09,000 --> 03:45:10,000
MATT: Awesome.

4580
03:45:10,000 --> 03:45:12,000
Well, guys, we're going to go ahead
and get home and rest.

4581
03:45:12,000 --> 03:45:13,500
Hope you enjoyed tonight's episode.

4582
03:45:13,500 --> 03:45:16,000
TALIESIN: Is there going to be 
one more giveaway?

4583
03:45:16,000 --> 03:45:17,000
MATT: Is there?

4584
03:45:17,000 --> 03:45:18,500
LAURA: Are we doing another giveaway?

4585
03:45:18,500 --> 03:45:20,520
LIAM: There were two Loot Crates, one--

4586
03:45:20,520 --> 03:45:22,590
LUCAS: We'll do a giveaway 
afterwards.

4587
03:45:22,590 --> 03:45:25,020
MATT: Okay, we'll do 
a giveaway afterwards. Perfect.

4588
03:45:25,020 --> 03:45:27,620
One more DX Loot Crate box
coming your way.

4589
03:45:27,620 --> 03:45:30,000
LAURA: Thanks, Loot Crate!

4590
03:45:30,000 --> 03:45:32,000
LIAM: Thanks, Joe Madureira,
for the art!

4591
03:45:32,000 --> 03:45:34,000
LAURA: Thanks, Joe!
ASHLEY: Get your posters!

4592
03:45:34,000 --> 03:45:35,500
TALIESIN: It's so cool.

4593
03:45:35,500 --> 03:45:38,000
LAURA: Thanks, Critters, 
for being awesome!

4594
03:45:38,000 --> 03:45:40,000
MATT: Hope you guys got to enjoy

4595
03:45:40,000 --> 03:45:43,000
our silly E3 couple hours
we did earlier on GameSpot.

4596
03:45:43,000 --> 03:45:45,000
I'm sure that'll go up soon, anyway.

4597
03:45:45,000 --> 03:45:48,000
But anyway, guys,
we'll see you next week.

4598
03:45:48,000 --> 03:45:52,000
Until then, rest well and,
is it Thursday yet? See you then.
