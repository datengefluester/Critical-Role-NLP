00:00:00,244 --> 00:00:03,094
MATT: Hello everyone! Welcome to Critical Role tonight!

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,479
We have some interesting adventurous points
to go over.

3
00:00:05,479 --> 00:00:08,467
We're also coming off International Tabletop Day,

4
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:09,952
which we had a great time.

5
00:00:09,952 --> 00:00:11,699
Met a lot of the wonderful fans, one of which

6
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:13,701
had created their own t-shirt of our group

7
00:00:13,701 --> 00:00:15,367
and inspired us to do the same!

8
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:17,692
So you'll see a bunch of us wearing our fantastic,

9
00:00:17,692 --> 00:00:20,499
full assortment of Critical Role party member t-shirts tonight.

10
00:00:20,499 --> 00:00:23,470
Just for fun.

11
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,160
In the meantime, let’s go ahead and get this started,

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,937
as we all have the chance to warm up with

13
00:00:27,937 --> 00:00:30,761
character backgrounds and maybe a little surprise.

14
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:32,847
So be back here in a few minutes, guys!

15
00:00:35,137 --> 00:00:40,402
(drumming battle music)

16
00:01:05,952 --> 00:01:11,239
(drumming battle music continues)

17
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:44,740
ASHLEY: Pike grew up in the outskirts of town,

18
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,174
near the Bramblewood.

19
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:48,511
Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes

20
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:50,672
with quite an unfavorable reputation.

21
00:01:50,672 --> 00:01:54,126
Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them

22
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:56,919
with the curse of the last name Trickfoot.

23
00:01:56,919 --> 00:02:00,065
Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption,

24
00:02:00,065 --> 00:02:02,935
had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather,

25
00:02:02,935 --> 00:02:05,437
Wilhand, who left his family at a young age

26
00:02:05,437 --> 00:02:06,713
after a dream.

27
00:02:06,713 --> 00:02:09,136
A dream that changed the course

28
00:02:09,136 --> 00:02:10,927
of the Trickfoot family.

29
00:02:10,927 --> 00:02:12,822
Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae

30
00:02:12,822 --> 00:02:15,252
and pledged from then on that him and his family

31
00:02:15,252 --> 00:02:18,218
would live a life of service and devotion.

32
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:22,435
As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal.

33
00:02:22,435 --> 00:02:26,422
Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers,

34
00:02:26,422 --> 00:02:29,305
she felt she had a purpose in making things whole

35
00:02:29,305 --> 00:02:30,831
that had once been broken.

36
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:33,582
She studied and learned the ways to heal

37
00:02:33,582 --> 00:02:35,070
through divine magic.

38
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,884
She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple,

39
00:02:37,884 --> 00:02:40,757
until one day, Wilhand was captured

40
00:02:40,757 --> 00:02:43,744
and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians.

41
00:02:43,744 --> 00:02:45,951
One of the goliaths took a stand

42
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:47,589
against the murder of the innocent gnome

43
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:50,946
and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead,

44
00:02:50,946 --> 00:02:53,013
abandoned by his herd.

45
00:02:54,093 --> 00:02:55,819
Wilhand went to Pike for help.

46
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:58,133
She prayed and healed this barbarian

47
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:01,443
as best she could, bringing him back to life.

48
00:03:01,443 --> 00:03:04,537
When he awoke, she discovered his name

49
00:03:04,537 --> 00:03:06,682
was Grog Strongjaw.

50
00:03:06,682 --> 00:03:09,854
After that, they were best of friends,

51
00:03:09,854 --> 00:03:11,483
a rather unlikely pair.

52
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,590
Little did she know that in a few years' time

53
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,403
Grog would soon return the favor

54
00:03:17,403 --> 00:03:20,054
and bring her back from the clutches of death.

55
00:03:23,374 --> 00:03:24,627
After being killed in battle,

56
00:03:24,627 --> 00:03:26,183
Pike felt angry.

57
00:03:26,183 --> 00:03:27,806
She wanted to be stronger

58
00:03:27,806 --> 00:03:29,495
so that it would never happen again.

59
00:03:29,495 --> 00:03:31,893
She spent four months at sea

60
00:03:31,893 --> 00:03:33,811
training with the men and women

61
00:03:33,811 --> 00:03:35,542
aboard a ship called the Broken Howl.

62
00:03:35,542 --> 00:03:39,131
Gripping her holy symbol in one hand,

63
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:40,910
and her morningstar in the other,

64
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,145
this time, Pike is ready.

65
00:03:45,595 --> 00:03:48,730
TRAVIS: Right, Listen up! If you have ale,

66
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,580
then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw!

67
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,724
A goliath of towering height and size,

68
00:03:55,724 --> 00:03:59,768
this barbarian has an appetite for the two great

69
00:03:59,768 --> 00:04:05,438
loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (chuckle)

70
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:06,540
(record scratch)

71
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,753
Wait.

72
00:04:07,753 --> 00:04:09,563
Easily the brains of the group,

73
00:04:09,563 --> 00:04:12,682
Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge

74
00:04:12,682 --> 00:04:16,730
of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things!

75
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,679
...also ale.

76
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:22,651
In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe,

77
00:04:22,651 --> 00:04:25,804
Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks

78
00:04:25,804 --> 00:04:27,882
of his family's wandering herd.

79
00:04:27,882 --> 00:04:33,262
But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods,

80
00:04:33,262 --> 00:04:36,773
he objected to the killing such an innocent life.

81
00:04:36,773 --> 00:04:41,699
A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this...

82
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,283
well this terrified little thing.

83
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:48,180
And his disobedience cost him dearly.

84
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,302
(weapon crack)

85
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:51,806
Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader,

86
00:04:51,806 --> 00:04:53,248
his uncle Kevdak,

87
00:04:53,248 --> 00:04:56,739
Grog was abandoned and left to die.

88
00:04:56,739 --> 00:05:00,414
Exiled from his herd, it was then that

89
00:05:00,414 --> 00:05:03,540
the relative of the very gnome he fought to save,

90
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,626
saved him.

91
00:05:05,626 --> 00:05:09,081
It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike,

92
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:12,868
that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge.

93
00:05:12,868 --> 00:05:16,934
And they have remained close friends ever since.

94
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:18,162
(brawling sounds)

95
00:05:18,162 --> 00:05:20,322
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging

96
00:05:20,322 --> 00:05:22,901
entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha!

97
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:26,380
...or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house,

98
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,309
where you pay for...

99
00:05:28,309 --> 00:05:29,553
lady favors.

100
00:05:29,553 --> 00:05:31,471
Also ale!

101
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:34,925
MARISHA: A first Impression of Keyleth would

102
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:36,334
leave you with little information

103
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:37,800
on the half-elven druid.

104
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,601
You might even think that her social awkwardness

105
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:43,356
due to her sheltered upbringing is kinda sweet.

106
00:05:43,356 --> 00:05:44,316
(chuckle)

107
00:05:44,316 --> 00:05:47,508
Of course, it would be unwise underestimate her

108
00:05:47,508 --> 00:05:49,056
based on first impressions.

109
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:50,314
(thunder crack)

110
00:05:50,314 --> 00:05:52,826
Under that unintimidating petite frame is a

111
00:05:52,826 --> 00:05:55,328
vicious beast waiting to be unleashed,

112
00:05:55,328 --> 00:05:57,707
whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of

113
00:05:57,707 --> 00:06:01,060
champions pee their pants, literally!

114
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,291
(soft chuckle)

115
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,655
Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people,

116
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,908
Keyleth was raised with a deep love

117
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,265
of nature and the elemental magics.

118
00:06:09,265 --> 00:06:11,975
It is her people’s inherent duty to protect the

119
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:14,092
delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

120
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:17,568
where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm.

121
00:06:17,568 --> 00:06:20,795
Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack

122
00:06:20,795 --> 00:06:23,407
for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities.

123
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:26,187
Well, if you consider kittens and

124
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:28,496
flying squirrels to be little beasts.

125
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:30,340
Which, I do.

126
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,363
(clears throat)

127
00:06:31,363 --> 00:06:34,282
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe,

128
00:06:34,282 --> 00:06:35,892
her father, Kohren,

129
00:06:35,892 --> 00:06:38,368
realized her true prodigious abilities and

130
00:06:38,368 --> 00:06:42,042
she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster.

131
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:45,569
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and

132
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:48,072
replaced with endless spell memorization,

133
00:06:48,072 --> 00:06:49,700
teachings from ancient traditions,

134
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,132
and exceedingly high expectations.

135
00:06:52,132 --> 00:06:55,436
Every druid leader to be must embark on a journey

136
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:57,027
to seek out the sister tribes

137
00:06:57,027 --> 00:06:59,391
in order to introduce and establish respect

138
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:01,221
amongst the fellow headmasters.

139
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:05,322
They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey.

140
00:07:05,322 --> 00:07:08,733
When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path

141
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:10,674
to truly discovering herself.

142
00:07:10,674 --> 00:07:13,967
Not knowing when, or if she will ever return.

143
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,854
As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben,

144
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:19,160
she meditated on the task ahead.

145
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,159
Part of the Aramente is proving yourself

146
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:24,347
a strong warrior, a valiant protector,

147
00:07:24,347 --> 00:07:26,910
and a wise and compassionate leader.

148
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,962
With this knowledge, one thought plays

149
00:07:29,962 --> 00:07:31,345
in repeat in her mind:

150
00:07:31,345 --> 00:07:34,468
Is she even worthy?

151
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:39,146
TALIESIN: Percy was the third child of 7 children,

152
00:07:39,146 --> 00:07:41,188
born to a noble family who lived far to the

153
00:07:41,188 --> 00:07:44,182
north in the ancient castle of Whitestone.

154
00:07:44,182 --> 00:07:46,648
With so many siblings to share the burdens of

155
00:07:46,648 --> 00:07:49,040
lordship, Percy turned his attention to the

156
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,101
sciences, engineering, and naturalism.

157
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:54,694
One day, a mysterious couple,

158
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:57,423
named Lord and Lady Briarwood, came to court.

159
00:07:57,423 --> 00:08:00,133
During a feast held in their honor,

160
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:02,384
the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle,

161
00:08:02,384 --> 00:08:06,118
killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way.

162
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,550
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon,

163
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,924
only to be freed by his younger sister.

164
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:14,431
Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods’ men.

165
00:08:14,431 --> 00:08:17,333
As they ran, Percy’s sister took

166
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,417
several arrows to the chest and fell.

167
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:22,321
Percy kept running, eventually jumping into

168
00:08:22,321 --> 00:08:25,504
a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom.

169
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:28,938
He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat.

170
00:08:28,938 --> 00:08:31,243
He barely remembered the next two years, as he

171
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:34,625
slowly made his way as far south as possible.

172
00:08:34,635 --> 00:08:37,169
Then one night, Percy had a dream.

173
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:39,865
A roaring cloud of smoke offered him

174
00:08:39,865 --> 00:08:42,794
vengeance against those who destroyed his family.

175
00:08:42,794 --> 00:08:47,165
When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun.

176
00:08:47,165 --> 00:08:49,585
(sound of a gun cocking and firing)

177
00:08:50,165 --> 00:08:53,692
SAM: Oh, you haven’t heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?

178
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:55,504
Well, gird your loins, ladies,

179
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:57,466
because he has his eye on you.

180
00:08:57,466 --> 00:09:00,517
A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly

181
00:09:00,517 --> 00:09:03,472
handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs

182
00:09:03,472 --> 00:09:06,602
almost as much as he sings his own praises.

183
00:09:06,602 --> 00:09:10,080
Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless

184
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,803
charm and soaring tenor voice to

185
00:09:11,803 --> 00:09:14,322
croon for coin and support his single mother.

186
00:09:14,322 --> 00:09:17,381
One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter,

187
00:09:17,381 --> 00:09:21,349
and joined Dr. Dranzel’s Spectacular Traveling Troupe

188
00:09:21,349 --> 00:09:23,378
where he learned the ways of the world,

189
00:09:23,378 --> 00:09:27,395
and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire.

190
00:09:27,395 --> 00:09:29,960
A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite

191
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,655
come to terms with the violent death

192
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,921
of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion.

193
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:38,091
While his years on the road provided many, shall we say,

194
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:41,350
educational experiences with the opposite sex,

195
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,951
deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing

196
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:46,163
he’s never known: the true love

197
00:09:46,163 --> 00:09:47,876
of a fellow gnome.

198
00:09:47,876 --> 00:09:51,730
Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first,

199
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,051
performer second, and fighter distant third.

200
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:57,438
On the battlefield, he’ll support his allies,

201
00:09:57,438 --> 00:10:00,419
but rarely draws blood unless it’s to protect

202
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:04,365
fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh,

203
00:10:04,365 --> 00:10:08,220
a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts

204
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,948
and makes the females swoon.

205
00:10:14,308 --> 00:10:15,907
ORION: Greetings and salutations.

206
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,901
I am Tiberius Stormwind.

207
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:19,846
I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

208
00:10:19,846 --> 00:10:21,861
located in the heart of Draconia,

209
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:24,397
born from a politically respected family.

210
00:10:24,397 --> 00:10:27,620
At the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer’s Rite,

211
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,146
showing prodigy-like control of my magic.

212
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:32,790
The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at

213
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,186
how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training.

214
00:10:36,186 --> 00:10:38,971
At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member

215
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,750
of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the

216
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,800
next few years, I almost went mad from the

217
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,809
malaise of being a guild member,

218
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:47,799
as it’s rather boring.

219
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:50,378
However, one day I happened upon a chamber,

220
00:10:50,378 --> 00:10:52,591
unused for quite some time.

221
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:55,026
In the room were stacks of books and maps

222
00:10:55,026 --> 00:10:56,879
of the surrounding cities and areas

223
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,375
around the known world.

224
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,482
For months I would frequent the chamber, and learned

225
00:11:00,482 --> 00:11:02,256
of artifacts from legend.

226
00:11:02,256 --> 00:11:05,061
After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts

227
00:11:05,061 --> 00:11:06,480
that caught my eye.

228
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,034
I brought these findings to the high council and was told that

229
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:11,730
all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon

230
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:15,398
was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries,

231
00:11:15,398 --> 00:11:17,745
and hence were lost forever.

232
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:20,697
I found those answers to be unacceptable.

233
00:11:20,697 --> 00:11:22,698
A year later I devised a ruse and managed to

234
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:25,237
convince the city council to lend support

235
00:11:25,237 --> 00:11:27,303
in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace

236
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:29,455
and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms.

237
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,035
Going from town to town and making friends and allies,

238
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:34,118
in and for the name of Draconia.

239
00:11:34,118 --> 00:11:35,578
Being a red dragonborn,

240
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:38,512
I had quite the task on my hands in that respect,

241
00:11:38,512 --> 00:11:41,276
but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore

242
00:11:41,276 --> 00:11:43,329
the world and find these artifacts,

243
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:46,124
as I felt the truth was out there.

244
00:11:46,124 --> 00:11:47,938
Some may describe me as buffoonish,

245
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:49,866
but I say poppycock to all that.

246
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:53,402
I am much sharper than most give me credit for.

247
00:11:53,402 --> 00:11:55,754
I just don’t pay attention to things sometimes.

248
00:11:55,754 --> 00:11:59,222
I’ve also been known to be rather cunning, loyal,

249
00:11:59,222 --> 00:12:03,240
happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous.

250
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,255
I can’t help but show my true scales every now and then.

251
00:12:06,255 --> 00:12:09,567
But overall, I think I’m quite friendly for a Dragonborn.

252
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:13,702
LIAM: Never entirely welcome in the company of

253
00:12:13,702 --> 00:12:15,492
elves or men, Vax'ildan learned

254
00:12:15,492 --> 00:12:18,438
at a young age to skip past formality,

255
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:21,870
preferring instead to invite himself in your door.

256
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,268
Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia,

257
00:12:24,268 --> 00:12:27,101
Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven

258
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:30,166
royalty and human peasantry.

259
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,000
Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins

260
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,546
were eventually sent off to their father

261
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,766
in the elven capital of Singorn.

262
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:39,802
But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed,

263
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:42,992
and their time in the capital didn’t last.

264
00:12:42,992 --> 00:12:46,045
The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on

265
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:47,770
the open road.

266
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,749
After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to

267
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:52,995
return to their mother, and journeyed

268
00:12:52,995 --> 00:12:55,122
back to the lands of their youth.

269
00:12:55,122 --> 00:12:57,485
But instead of finding their childhood home,

270
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,537
they returned to a pile of rubble.

271
00:13:00,537 --> 00:13:03,830
Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash.

272
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,787
Pressing the townspeople for answers,

273
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,148
they learned of the day the dragon came.

274
00:13:09,158 --> 00:13:12,418
(dragon roaring)

275
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:15,955
With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister

276
00:13:15,955 --> 00:13:19,027
set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei.

277
00:13:19,027 --> 00:13:24,118
An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life’s

278
00:13:24,118 --> 00:13:26,925
challenges in his own particular way,

279
00:13:26,925 --> 00:13:29,743
often by sidestepping them entirely.

280
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:32,493
And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn’t enough,

281
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:34,853
(ringing weapons SFX)

282
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:37,652
the way of blades the elves schooled him in

283
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:39,872
more than makes up the difference.

284
00:13:40,772 --> 00:13:42,749
LAURA: Like so many half-elves,

285
00:13:42,749 --> 00:13:45,737
Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering

286
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:50,017
the cool reception of a people who don’t fully accept her.

287
00:13:50,017 --> 00:13:54,098
Born of a human mother, and an elven father 
who only later in life

288
00:13:54,098 --> 00:13:56,639
took an interest in their existence,

289
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,792
Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly

290
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:03,080
realized the only people they could truly rely on

291
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,524
in this world were each other.

292
00:14:06,524 --> 00:14:09,633
It was at the age of 10 when the two were taken from their mother,

293
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:11,832
and brought to live in Singorn,

294
00:14:11,832 --> 00:14:15,991
the isolated elven city for which their father 
was an ambassador.

295
00:14:15,991 --> 00:14:19,680
He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance,

296
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,574
and after too many years of disdainful looks,

297
00:14:22,574 --> 00:14:26,109
the pair decided to leave his indifference behind,

298
00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:28,955
and set out on their own.

299
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:32,814
Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and

300
00:14:32,814 --> 00:14:34,470
learning the ways of the thief,

301
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,720
while Vex kept to the woods.

302
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,442
She preferred the isolation.

303
00:14:40,442 --> 00:14:44,313
Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track,

304
00:14:44,313 --> 00:14:46,865
to spy and to shoot.

305
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:49,264
And through a series of fateful events,

306
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:52,977
earned herself a companion in the form of a bear -

307
00:14:52,994 --> 00:14:55,254
her own stolen Trinket -

308
00:14:55,254 --> 00:14:59,194
to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely.

309
00:14:59,194 --> 00:15:03,905
Also he is adorable, and gives expert massages.

310
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,676
MATT: Welcome back, everyone! The new intro tonight,

311
00:15:07,676 --> 00:15:09,951
which I think we're all pretty damn proud of,

312
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:13,342
was put together by our fantastic overlord, Zac.

313
00:15:13,342 --> 00:15:19,460
(all cheering)

314
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,095
MATT: It put him to work for quite some time,

315
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:24,038
also the mixing and sound effects done by

316
00:15:24,038 --> 00:15:25,976
the amazing Alex Neat and the music you heard

317
00:15:25,976 --> 00:15:29,360
was composed by the amazingly talented 
Jason Charles Miller.

318
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,658
So if you don't know Jason you should look him up.

319
00:15:32,658 --> 00:15:34,593
He's done stuff for The Guild and many other web shows.

320
00:15:34,593 --> 00:15:36,965
Also a fantastic musician on his own with his own stuff.

321
00:15:36,965 --> 00:15:38,152
He is the lead singer of Godhead.

322
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:39,813
He's just a good guy.

323
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:43,950
Also a voice actor, look him up if you have any time.

324
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,009
Good people, and he lent his talents to our intro

325
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:47,687
so we really appreciate that, buddy.

326
00:15:49,857 --> 00:15:52,672
Also we had a great time at Tabletop Day.

327
00:15:52,672 --> 00:15:54,453
Got to meet some of our fans.

328
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,942
Got to take some pictures.

329
00:15:55,942 --> 00:15:56,821
Bunch of cool folks.

330
00:15:56,821 --> 00:15:58,616
Some of us got to go on the stream

331
00:15:58,616 --> 00:15:59,889
at certain points in the day.

332
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:01,133
All around a good time!

333
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:02,468
So those of you that got a chance to come,

334
00:16:02,468 --> 00:16:04,085
thank you so much!

335
00:16:04,085 --> 00:16:05,926
And a fan created, as I mentioned before,

336
00:16:05,926 --> 00:16:07,240
this awesome t-shirt with the roster,

337
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,832
so we were all really inspired to go ahead

338
00:16:08,832 --> 00:16:11,608
and make some of our own.

339
00:16:11,608 --> 00:16:17,256
Got the party showing off their Critical Role positive.

340
00:16:17,256 --> 00:16:19,372
MARISHA: So one of the things

341
00:16:19,372 --> 00:16:21,186
we were actually talking about doing,

342
00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:29,656
so we'd like to give a shout out to the person who made this,

343
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,572
big shout out to @RuzGofDi.

344
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:33,448
Thank you! For doing this.

345
00:16:33,448 --> 00:16:38,058
A lot of people have been asking for shirts.

346
00:16:38,058 --> 00:16:41,371
I don't know if you guys maybe would be into that or not.

347
00:16:41,371 --> 00:16:43,614
So we thought maybe we would wear these,

348
00:16:43,614 --> 00:16:45,294
see what you guys thought.

349
00:16:45,294 --> 00:16:47,878
But if you guys are into it,

350
00:16:47,878 --> 00:16:50,405
we thought about doing a limited run of these

351
00:16:50,405 --> 00:16:56,436
and making this the first of our fan-designed t shirts.

352
00:16:56,436 --> 00:16:57,839
SAM: First of many.

353
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,419
MARISHA: First of many.

354
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:02,794
Every once in awhile we'll have fans submit designs

355
00:17:02,794 --> 00:17:05,006
and then we'll pick a winner.

356
00:17:05,006 --> 00:17:06,863
Each one will be a limited run.

357
00:17:06,863 --> 00:17:09,819
So if you guys will like this, let us know,

358
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:12,001
and maybe we'll make it happen.

359
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:14,441
SAM: I'm wearing one right now in my underpants,

360
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:16,270
which we will be selling next week.

361
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,148
MARISHA: Yes, and there might be some stills 
of that to order.

362
00:17:20,148 --> 00:17:22,333
ORION: I'm going to wear mine next game.

363
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,137
TALIESIN: Next game.

364
00:17:23,137 --> 00:17:26,655
MATT: I guess some people are into the idea,

365
00:17:26,655 --> 00:17:28,209
let the chat know.

366
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:29,938
People seem to be, and we'll be putting more designs out,

367
00:17:29,938 --> 00:17:33,275
getting some shirt possibilities to you guys in the near future.

368
00:17:33,275 --> 00:17:35,903
MARISHA: Let us know in the chat guys.

369
00:17:35,903 --> 00:17:39,340
LIAM: Wait wait wait, I've got some thing.

370
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:44,259
I just gave everyone in the party rupees, treasure!

371
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:46,083
MARISHA: Rupees!

372
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,150
LIAM: These were sent to me by Tim West

373
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,925
who has a great new company called Fantasy Coin HQ.

374
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:55,067
If you go to fantasycoinhq.com he makes -

375
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:57,603
Matt's holding up a dwarven coin at the moment -

376
00:17:57,603 --> 00:18:00,973
they make gems, they make fantasy coins, nerd coins.

377
00:18:00,973 --> 00:18:02,987
SAM: Are we doing free ads now for people?

378
00:18:02,987 --> 00:18:04,231
LIAM: This is just a thank you!

379
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:05,526
MATT: This is a thank you.

380
00:18:05,526 --> 00:18:06,684
LIAM: Check it out.

381
00:18:06,684 --> 00:18:10,840
Or if you just hit a really tall tuft of grass with a sword,

382
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,318
these will pop out of it so you don't have to order them.

383
00:18:13,318 --> 00:18:14,800
Just mow your lawn.

384
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,365
MARISHA: They’re hefty, too.

385
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:22,239
ORION: If these were rupees, this is what they would feel like.

386
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:24,836
MARISHA: I kind of want to throw them at people

387
00:18:24,836 --> 00:18:26,266
across the room!

388
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:29,162
ORION: I want to trade them, put them in a pouch.

389
00:18:29,162 --> 00:18:32,499
MATT: Also guys, as a note, we have,

390
00:18:32,499 --> 00:18:34,877
available tonight for the person,

391
00:18:34,877 --> 00:18:36,600
for people who have managed to get themselves

392
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,746
to 2,150 subscribers tonight,

393
00:18:38,746 --> 00:18:40,800
we will send out another promo kit

394
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,360
to one of you folks in the chat

395
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,011
with another signed picture of our Critical Role cast.

396
00:18:45,011 --> 00:18:47,527
So be sure to see if we can get the subscribers

397
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,010
to climb up as well,

398
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,543
so keep an eye out for that in the evening

399
00:18:50,543 --> 00:18:52,440
so we can give out one of those before the night is over.

400
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,555
That would be awesome.

401
00:18:54,555 --> 00:18:55,874
SAM: Let's do this!

402
00:18:55,874 --> 00:18:58,846
MATT: Let's kick into the game proper, guys!

403
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:02,736
Let's get some proper music playing, 
because that's what I do.

404
00:19:02,736 --> 00:19:05,198
ORION: That’s what I baby do right.

405
00:19:05,198 --> 00:19:08,115
SAM: (Beatboxing)

406
00:19:08,115 --> 00:19:12,944
MATT: So last we left off, music's not playing here.

407
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,286
I need music!

408
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,437
SAM: Doesn't matter.
MATT: The music's important to me!

409
00:19:16,437 --> 00:19:18,793
The party had been travelling

410
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:20,915
into the dwarven city of Kraghammer

411
00:19:20,915 --> 00:19:22,959
at the behest of arcanist Allura Vysoren

412
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:26,491
in search of a halfling paladin,

413
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:29,216
a very revered folk hero named Lady Kima of Vord

414
00:19:29,216 --> 00:19:31,122
who had gone missing following a vision quest

415
00:19:31,122 --> 00:19:33,550
somewhere beneath the dwarven city of Kraghammer,

416
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,759
supposedly for some great evil that was germinating there,

417
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,568
festering and growing.

418
00:19:37,568 --> 00:19:39,600
After you guys traversed through the dwarven city,

419
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,396
you began to find your way down into the mines.

420
00:19:42,396 --> 00:19:45,710
The mythril mines of Greyspine beneath the dwarven town.

421
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:49,366
After a few fateful encounters, the return of your gnome cleric.

422
00:19:50,076 --> 00:19:52,766
ASHLEY: Hey, that's me!

423
00:19:52,766 --> 00:19:55,850
MATT: Grog having his proverbial brains blown out

424
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,498
by an intellect devourer.

425
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:03,076
The party then decided to make friends with a mind flayer,

426
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,967
an illithid that had been cast out from its people

427
00:20:04,967 --> 00:20:09,354
seeking vengeance and possible return to its people.

428
00:20:09,354 --> 00:20:10,878
Upon making this alliance,

429
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:13,490
they made an attack on the dwarven, or the duergar,

430
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,895
war camp that is threatening to rise up

431
00:20:15,895 --> 00:20:17,363
and attack Kraghammer

432
00:20:17,363 --> 00:20:19,436
from deep within the mountains themselves.

433
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:21,070
The attack was successful.

434
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,234
The general was killed, interrogated,

435
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:23,998
and some interesting information was gleaned from him

436
00:20:23,998 --> 00:20:26,282
before his brain was sucked out from his head

437
00:20:26,282 --> 00:20:28,945
by Clarota, the mindflayer friend.

438
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:32,680
However, this attack also announced to the local war camp

439
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,134
of your presence and in the process of attempting 
to escape,

440
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:39,270
the druid was damaged and lost her eagle form

441
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,956
and thus began a freefall of many party members.

442
00:20:41,956 --> 00:20:44,255
A haphazard attempt to use the magic carpet

443
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:47,421
far over its weight limit led most of the party

444
00:20:47,421 --> 00:20:50,205
to come crash landing and nearly killing everyone.

445
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:52,406
Managed to escape,

446
00:20:52,406 --> 00:20:56,025
walled themselves in thanks to 
Keyleth’s stone wall spell.

447
00:20:56,025 --> 00:20:58,239
And after staying the evening in one 
of the deeper tunnels,

448
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:01,785
and barely avoiding a roving band of duergar there,

449
00:21:01,785 --> 00:21:03,788
you managed to find yourselves in battle with 2 ogres

450
00:21:03,788 --> 00:21:07,843
carrying some sort of strange, mutated, 
black pudding ooze

451
00:21:07,843 --> 00:21:09,283
contained in a glass container.

452
00:21:09,283 --> 00:21:10,997
The glass container being shattered, of course,

453
00:21:10,997 --> 00:21:13,869
by an explosive arrow created by Percy and fired by Vex.

454
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:14,894
LAURA: Go us!

455
00:21:14,894 --> 00:21:16,773
MATT: At the very start of the battle,

456
00:21:16,773 --> 00:21:18,475
led into a very rough battle

457
00:21:18,475 --> 00:21:19,855
with this strange mutating ooze

458
00:21:19,855 --> 00:21:21,690
that kept splitting and splitting,

459
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,923
until through some good teamwork,

460
00:21:24,923 --> 00:21:26,959
crafty use of telekinesis and a nearby lava pool,

461
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:29,972
and general high damage rolls,

462
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:31,512
you guys managed to survive the encounter.

463
00:21:31,512 --> 00:21:32,204
TRAVIS: Barely.

464
00:21:32,204 --> 00:21:33,954
MATT: Making your way to the bottom of this tunnel,

465
00:21:33,954 --> 00:21:36,884
you found yourself looping back around

466
00:21:36,884 --> 00:21:38,335
to the large crevice

467
00:21:38,335 --> 00:21:39,869
where the giant waterfall had fallen in before,

468
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:41,403
where you had met Clarota.

469
00:21:41,403 --> 00:21:43,228
Which allowed you to retrieve your bear Trinket.

470
00:21:43,228 --> 00:21:45,504
LAURA: Yeah! Trinket!

471
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:48,271
MATT: We pick up as you guys begin to step down

472
00:21:48,271 --> 00:21:50,889
into the lower tunnels,

473
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:53,169
the ones that are partially coated

474
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:56,083
with a series of magma pools and falls

475
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,913
that are trickling out of the rockside.

476
00:21:58,913 --> 00:22:00,319
All right everyone.

477
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:09,537
SAM: I was just so out of it last time.

478
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:10,952
Have we rested?

479
00:22:10,952 --> 00:22:12,631
Are we in some need of rest?

480
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,162
LAURA: We should probably rest.

481
00:22:14,162 --> 00:22:15,448
SAM: What are we around?

482
00:22:15,448 --> 00:22:16,612
What's near us?

483
00:22:16,612 --> 00:22:17,974
Is this just a tunnel?

484
00:22:17,974 --> 00:22:19,686
Is there any sort of shelter, caves?

485
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:22,528
LAURA: We're by that lake with the giant monster.

486
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:24,340
LIAM: We circled all the way back around.

487
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,415
SAM: Oh shit.

488
00:22:25,415 --> 00:22:26,514
LAURA: And went down to that place

489
00:22:26,514 --> 00:22:27,786
that you told us not to go in the first place?

490
00:22:27,786 --> 00:22:29,487
Yeah, that's where we ended up.

491
00:22:29,487 --> 00:22:31,155
SAM: How was that for you?

492
00:22:31,155 --> 00:22:32,941
(all laugh)

493
00:22:34,081 --> 00:22:35,592
MATT: So essentially there was--

494
00:22:35,592 --> 00:22:37,496
SAM: We're back in the camp.

495
00:22:37,496 --> 00:22:38,553
MATT: You're under the camp.

496
00:22:38,553 --> 00:22:41,269
You're where the giant chasm leads down into the waterfall.

497
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:42,707
There is a pool of water at the bottom

498
00:22:42,707 --> 00:22:44,312
where the aboleth was in the water.

499
00:22:44,312 --> 00:22:45,559
LIAM: We just barely survived the chat room

500
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:47,229
and now we need to rest.

501
00:22:47,229 --> 00:22:49,937
TRAVIS: (chuckles) The chatroom.

502
00:22:49,937 --> 00:22:51,742
Take it easy on us, all right?

503
00:22:51,742 --> 00:22:53,645
MATT: You guys also just woke up about 2, 3 hours ago.

504
00:22:53,645 --> 00:22:56,347
LAURA: Right, so we don't really -

505
00:22:56,347 --> 00:22:57,620
oh, we can take hit points.

506
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,270
MATT: You guys can take a short rest

507
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,329
and use your hit dice to heal up.

508
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:02,907
You didn't take any damage last game.

509
00:23:02,907 --> 00:23:04,077
Thankfully you stayed out of the fray.

510
00:23:04,077 --> 00:23:04,989
SAM: So I'm okay.

511
00:23:04,989 --> 00:23:06,146
That's all I need to know.

512
00:23:08,066 --> 00:23:11,979
MATT: You did use one of your Dominate spells.

513
00:23:11,979 --> 00:23:12,985
SAM: Okay.

514
00:23:12,985 --> 00:23:14,457
MATT: Only thing of note.

515
00:23:15,777 --> 00:23:17,036
So the rest of you who need to heal up

516
00:23:17,036 --> 00:23:18,533
can use this time to take a short rest

517
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:20,327
and use your hit dice to heal up on your own.

518
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:23,485
TRAVIS: I'm ready.

519
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,658
Who we fighting next?

520
00:23:24,658 --> 00:23:26,228
SAM: Anyone need some healing?

521
00:23:26,228 --> 00:23:27,678
Are we all okay? Are we all good?

522
00:23:27,678 --> 00:23:28,732
ASHLEY: I think we're all good.

523
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:31,261
Where's everybody at in terms of...

524
00:23:31,261 --> 00:23:33,833
ORION: Well, I'm fine.

525
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:36,149
LAURA: On a personal level, or?

526
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:38,581
ASHLEY: You mean like in life, or?

527
00:23:40,517 --> 00:23:43,160
SAM: As we survey the area,

528
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,907
how many tunnels we looking at?

529
00:23:44,907 --> 00:23:46,520
What's our options here?

530
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,372
MATT: So,

531
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:50,460
(all laugh)

532
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,732
TRAVIS: He's back, he's back.

533
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:54,480
ORION: Would you calm down?

534
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,120
MATT: Let me pull out this visual aid for you.

535
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,866
This is the tunnel sequence

536
00:24:00,866 --> 00:24:02,831
you guys have traversed down to the main area

537
00:24:02,831 --> 00:24:04,466
where the goblin encampment was.

538
00:24:04,466 --> 00:24:06,354
This is the large bridge that went across the giant chasm

539
00:24:06,354 --> 00:24:08,251
to where the duergar war camp was.

540
00:24:08,251 --> 00:24:11,981
This is the giant drop-off at the waterfall.

541
00:24:11,981 --> 00:24:13,870
You guys are currently in this section

542
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,228
about to go deeper into this tunnel

543
00:24:15,228 --> 00:24:17,768
where a series of small magma trickles are pouring

544
00:24:17,768 --> 00:24:19,533
out of the rock.

545
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:22,579
SAM: So we never went up to the war camp and through it.

546
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:23,706
MATT: You did.

547
00:24:23,706 --> 00:24:25,136
SAM: Oh we did!

548
00:24:25,136 --> 00:24:27,120
LIAM: We crashed down by the tunnel, we fled.

549
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,868
We sealed up the way behind us, ran in.

550
00:24:30,868 --> 00:24:33,961
SAM: Got it. So we should keep going?

551
00:24:33,961 --> 00:24:35,340
We should just keep going.

552
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,304
Magma? Follow the magma.

553
00:24:37,304 --> 00:24:38,736
LIAM: Well I recommend.

554
00:24:38,736 --> 00:24:41,551
We don't want to go up and through the camp again?

555
00:24:41,551 --> 00:24:42,974
LAURA: No no no, we're going into the cavern.

556
00:24:42,974 --> 00:24:44,347
LIAM: So we're going to backtrack the way we came

557
00:24:44,347 --> 00:24:46,325
to that war camp road, yes?

558
00:24:46,325 --> 00:24:48,839
LAURA: No, we're going into the tunnel.

559
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,889
SAM: Did you see the visual aid?

560
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,562
ORION: Yes, we are going into the lava tunnel.

561
00:24:52,562 --> 00:24:54,005
LAURA: No no no, in through the tunnel.

562
00:24:54,005 --> 00:24:55,600
LIAM: I’ll just follow. I thought I understood.

563
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,271
MATT: (laughs) It’s been a week.

564
00:24:57,271 --> 00:24:58,561
SAM: I mean there might be something to be gleaned

565
00:24:58,561 --> 00:25:00,165
from going back to the war camp.

566
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,430
LAURA: That tunnel.

567
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,531
LIAM: We went out of there.

568
00:25:02,531 --> 00:25:03,386
LAURA: No no no no no.

569
00:25:03,386 --> 00:25:04,900
MATT: You guys came through here,

570
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,284
you traveled across over the war camp,

571
00:25:06,284 --> 00:25:08,664
went back here and tunneled below.

572
00:25:08,664 --> 00:25:10,422
LAURA: And popped this out right there.

573
00:25:10,422 --> 00:25:11,652
So now we're going into this.

574
00:25:11,652 --> 00:25:13,184
MATT: Correct. Maps.

575
00:25:13,184 --> 00:25:17,012
LIAM: And just to make sure that my memory is on point--

576
00:25:17,012 --> 00:25:18,101
TRAVIS: It's not.

577
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:20,146
LIAM: --Before we circled back around,

578
00:25:20,146 --> 00:25:22,572
we hit a fork in the road where we could have gone up

579
00:25:22,572 --> 00:25:23,603
and we could have gone down.

580
00:25:23,603 --> 00:25:24,694
MATT: Correct.

581
00:25:24,694 --> 00:25:25,935
LIAM: So that's behind us.

582
00:25:25,935 --> 00:25:28,545
LAURA: That's behind us, we're going down down down.

583
00:25:28,545 --> 00:25:29,595
LIAM: Cheers.

584
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:33,165
MATT: Cheers indeed, huzzah. All right.

585
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:34,304
LAURA: Shall we?

586
00:25:35,484 --> 00:25:37,030
ASHLEY: We shall!

587
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:40,113
SAM: Is Clarence with us still?

588
00:25:40,113 --> 00:25:42,583
MATT: Clarota is indeed with you.

589
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:46,541
Clarota took a large black iron duergar bolt

590
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:49,541
to the chest earlier and is mostly recovered

591
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:52,376
but is still even more hunched than usual.

592
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:53,665
LAURA: Does he need healing?

593
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:55,204
ASHLEY: He also ate those brains.

594
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:56,394
MATT: The brains helped him--

595
00:25:56,394 --> 00:25:57,609
ASHLEY: Helped him a little bit?

596
00:25:57,609 --> 00:25:59,671
MATT: --keep healthy, but he's still a little wounded

597
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:01,204
but he's taking his time to rest up.

598
00:26:01,204 --> 00:26:02,662
He seems to be okay.

599
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:04,915
Not as worse for wear as he was before.

600
00:26:04,915 --> 00:26:09,072
A slight wheeze that's always to him still present.

601
00:26:09,072 --> 00:26:12,024
ASHLEY: He's just always a little weezy.

602
00:26:12,024 --> 00:26:14,102
LAURA &amp; LIAM: (meh meh meh sounds)

603
00:26:14,102 --> 00:26:16,052
MATT: Sounds just like that.

604
00:26:16,052 --> 00:26:21,461
So, as you guys begin to push down into this lower chasm,

605
00:26:21,461 --> 00:26:25,110
the temperature of the air itself

606
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:29,048
grows steadily warmer and warmer with a drier heat.

607
00:26:29,048 --> 00:26:30,351
ORION: This feels nice.

608
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:31,945
MATT: You find yourselves, especially those of you

609
00:26:31,945 --> 00:26:33,155
with thick armor--

610
00:26:33,155 --> 00:26:34,875
ASHLEY: Oh, it's so hot!

611
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:36,994
MATT: --You find that sweat beads begin to 
trickle down the side of your face--

612
00:26:36,994 --> 00:26:37,930
ASHLEY: I'm sweating!

613
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,005
MARISHA: You're all glisteny!

614
00:26:39,005 --> 00:26:41,280
MATT: --And begin to pool and gather
in parts of your chestplate.

615
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,210
SAM: Pike, if you'd like me to hold your armor

616
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,276
or do you want me to take it off for a little while?

617
00:26:45,276 --> 00:26:47,238
ASHLEY: No, I'll keep it on just for safety.

618
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:49,260
SAM: Let it hang out a little bit?

619
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,215
LIAM: Do you even lift, bro?

620
00:26:52,215 --> 00:26:54,675
SAM: Just saying, you might feel more comfortable

621
00:26:54,675 --> 00:26:57,610
with a loose fitting sort of cloak?

622
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:58,914
LAURA: Scanlan, stop being creepy!

623
00:26:58,914 --> 00:27:01,241
SAM: I'm not creepy! I'm just trying to be mindful!

624
00:27:01,241 --> 00:27:02,595
ASHLEY: No, it's fine Scanlan.

625
00:27:02,595 --> 00:27:04,807
TRAVIS: Very considerate of you, a gentleman's offer.

626
00:27:04,807 --> 00:27:06,660
ASHLEY: Yeah, it’s okay. I'll keep it on.

627
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,270
SAM: I'll just have to use my imagination.

628
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,397
MARISHA: A gentleman's offer, yes.

629
00:27:10,397 --> 00:27:12,547
That's what we'll call it from now on.

630
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,258
TRAVIS: What permission?

631
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:15,538
SAM: Onward.

632
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:17,555
MATT: Pressing further down, the air itself that once

633
00:27:17,555 --> 00:27:19,713
had a kind of a hint of that sulfur smell,

634
00:27:19,713 --> 00:27:21,835
is now becoming stronger and stronger as you step

635
00:27:21,835 --> 00:27:23,992
deeper and deeper into this cavernous tunnel.

636
00:27:23,992 --> 00:27:27,921
It rests about 30 feet to 40 feet at width and about

637
00:27:27,921 --> 00:27:32,493
25, 30 feet up and it varies to come pinched tighter

638
00:27:32,493 --> 00:27:34,756
or wider at moments, but it continues to be

639
00:27:34,756 --> 00:27:39,156
a steady downward climb in a continuous direction.

640
00:27:39,156 --> 00:27:41,210
The small trickles, some of them pool

641
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:47,271
and gather into these small, magma cups if you will.

642
00:27:47,271 --> 00:27:51,098
Molten hot magma, I knew it was coming.

643
00:27:51,098 --> 00:27:54,028
ORION: (murmurs) I was just wondering if it would happen.

644
00:27:54,028 --> 00:27:56,392
MATT: Ooh, that's minus 200 experience points.

645
00:27:56,392 --> 00:27:57,993
(all laugh)

646
00:27:57,993 --> 00:28:01,315
ORION: I feel a bit weaker now.

647
00:28:04,885 --> 00:28:09,563
MATT: You get about 20 or 30 minutes deeper into this 
tunnel

648
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:13,603
before the sweltering heat gets noticeably warmer

649
00:28:13,603 --> 00:28:17,046
and as you crest a slight incline and decline

650
00:28:17,046 --> 00:28:19,611
over a small hill portion of this tunnel,

651
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:21,883
you can see now a large portion of the rock has

652
00:28:21,883 --> 00:28:26,496
collapsed on the left side and a gargantuan pool of magma

653
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,898
is pooling into the tunnel, essentially covering

654
00:28:29,898 --> 00:28:31,715
half of the tunnel you are traversing down.

655
00:28:31,715 --> 00:28:35,527
It can be walked on the side of safely at about 2 or 3

656
00:28:35,527 --> 00:28:38,605
at shoulder width, but you only have about 
a 15 foot width here

657
00:28:38,605 --> 00:28:43,444
and the rest of it is just extremely bright, hot, molten rock.

658
00:28:43,444 --> 00:28:44,850
LAURA: Does it hurt us to get near it?

659
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,604
MATT: No, but it's uncomfortable and something

660
00:28:46,604 --> 00:28:48,190
to be very aware of and to watch your step.

661
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,193
ORION: I feel great!

662
00:28:49,193 --> 00:28:50,004
MATT: You feel great.

663
00:28:50,004 --> 00:28:52,328
LIAM: I would just like to point out that we're 9 adults playing

664
00:28:52,328 --> 00:28:54,298
don't touch the hot lava at the moment.

665
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:56,277
(all laugh)

666
00:28:58,177 --> 00:29:01,246
SAM: Keyleth, you don't have any way of -

667
00:29:01,246 --> 00:29:03,292
say it gets hotter than this?

668
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:06,009
You don't have any way of getting some water out here?

669
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:09,378
ORION: Ooh! I do! And I pull out an empty bottle.

670
00:29:09,378 --> 00:29:13,887
LAURA: Oh? Oh?

671
00:29:13,887 --> 00:29:17,303
LIAM: Tiberius, I've seen that bottle a lot. What does it do?

672
00:29:17,303 --> 00:29:20,718
ORION: Oh! Um well, uh. I pull out two bottles.

673
00:29:21,454 --> 00:29:24,044
This one - they're both empty bottles -

674
00:29:24,044 --> 00:29:27,314
but this one is an air bottle and this one is a water bottle.

675
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:30,675
LIAM: Oh! Thank you! That clears that up!

676
00:29:30,675 --> 00:29:34,025
(all laugh)

677
00:29:34,025 --> 00:29:36,822
TRAVIS: Even I feel dumber right now.

678
00:29:36,822 --> 00:29:38,280
(all laugh)

679
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,013
SAM: Your intelligence is now 4.

680
00:29:40,013 --> 00:29:40,875
(all laugh)

681
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,163
TRAVIS: 4...3 and a half.

682
00:29:42,163 --> 00:29:43,874
LIAM: Does it make a lot of water?

683
00:29:43,874 --> 00:29:49,056
ORION: Oh! This, if we ever need air--

684
00:29:49,056 --> 00:29:52,108
SAM: I think that's the water one that you just pulled out.

685
00:29:52,108 --> 00:29:54,597
ORION: I take it out (wind SFX).

686
00:29:54,597 --> 00:29:56,473
I control a small gust.

687
00:29:56,473 --> 00:29:58,805
LAURA: Yes, but what about water?

688
00:30:00,819 --> 00:30:01,702
Oh my.

689
00:30:02,442 --> 00:30:05,319
ORION: This, if we need water -

690
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:07,181
And I do a small stream.

691
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:09,661
MATT: Okay. So a little bit of water just begins to pour perpetually,

692
00:30:09,661 --> 00:30:11,930
and without seeming end due to the size of the bottle.

693
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,280
SAM: It's like a piss stream!

694
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,383
LAURA: Oh, nice!

695
00:30:14,383 --> 00:30:15,814
ORION: So, if you want to just squirt -

696
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:19,510
and I do a small, little squirt-blasts on Scanlan.

697
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,235
SAM: Ahh!

698
00:30:22,725 --> 00:30:25,003
LAURA: Oh, okay. Lovely.

699
00:30:25,003 --> 00:30:26,471
LIAM: Is that unlimited?

700
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:27,975
ORION: Well, of course it is!

701
00:30:27,975 --> 00:30:29,929
Why would I carry a non-magical item on me?

702
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:31,505
That's ridiculous.

703
00:30:31,505 --> 00:30:33,264
ASHLEY: Just a water bottle.

704
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:36,745
ORION: So yes, Scanlan, we're fine.

705
00:30:36,745 --> 00:30:38,541
SAM: That's good to know.

706
00:30:38,541 --> 00:30:40,007
LAURA: So, should we try to cross this little path here?

707
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:41,388
ASHLEY: That sounds cool!

708
00:30:41,388 --> 00:30:42,424
SAM: That's really cool.

709
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:43,963
LAURA: Can I use my tracking to see any of those duergar?

710
00:30:43,963 --> 00:30:46,983
To see if any of them have passed through the area;

711
00:30:46,983 --> 00:30:48,802
if there's a large group of them ahead of us?

712
00:30:48,802 --> 00:30:49,845
MATT: Sure.

713
00:30:49,845 --> 00:30:53,014
LAURA: I can use my tracking and my favored terrain

714
00:30:53,014 --> 00:30:55,040
to see how many within 6 miles,

715
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,763
if there's a large group of them.

716
00:30:56,763 --> 00:30:58,160
MATT: Yes you can. All right.

717
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,313
Go ahead and roll for your tracking check on that.

718
00:31:01,313 --> 00:31:02,287
LIAM: First roll.

719
00:31:02,287 --> 00:31:03,647
MATT: I believe it's survival.

720
00:31:03,647 --> 00:31:05,120
LAURA: Ooh! Here we go!

721
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,764
TRAVIS: Do it for the Star Wars trailer.

722
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:07,667
MARISHA: Roll. Roll. Roll.

723
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:09,029
MATT: This is with advantage, I believe,

724
00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:10,267
because it's your favored terrain, correct?

725
00:31:10,267 --> 00:31:11,500
LAURA: Oh, okay.

726
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,638
MARISHA: (singing) Your favored terrain!

727
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:14,512
LAURA: Okay, that's better.

728
00:31:14,512 --> 00:31:15,648
Is that it?

729
00:31:15,648 --> 00:31:16,460
LIAM: Survival.

730
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,350
LAURA: 21?

731
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,926
MATT: 21! All right.

732
00:31:19,926 --> 00:31:22,222
You take a moment,

733
00:31:22,222 --> 00:31:25,338
and about 30 to 40 feet, you go through

734
00:31:25,338 --> 00:31:26,732
and inspect the way the terrain's been pushed

735
00:31:26,732 --> 00:31:27,682
and the dirt has been shoved aside.

736
00:31:27,682 --> 00:31:30,230
Tracking footprints and scuff marks on the rock

737
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,491
and the walls nearby, seeing if any of the flows

738
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:35,111
have been interrupted recently, and you ascertain

739
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:38,557
that there is actually a pretty continuous patrol through here.

740
00:31:38,557 --> 00:31:41,766
About once every 4 to 8 hours up and down this tunnel

741
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:45,271
that contain anywhere from 5 to 10 or more duergar,

742
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:46,959
sometimes other, larger creatures.

743
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:49,114
You find footprints that resemble maybe the ogres

744
00:31:49,114 --> 00:31:52,245
you mentioned earlier, possible troll footprints,

745
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:55,182
but you're not familiar with that entity.

746
00:31:55,182 --> 00:31:59,322
You also notice some of the walls have what looks like

747
00:31:59,322 --> 00:32:01,483
small, localized cave-ins, almost as if something

748
00:32:01,483 --> 00:32:03,550
had burrowed through at one time or another.

749
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,499
TRAVIS: Awesome. Great.

750
00:32:05,499 --> 00:32:07,005
MATT: Large, large creatures. So, there's also things

751
00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:09,584
that exist outside of the tunnel system.

752
00:32:09,584 --> 00:32:10,739
ASHLEY: Like Tremors?

753
00:32:10,739 --> 00:32:12,202
LAURA: So, as quickly as possible, we should get 
through these tunnels, I assume?

754
00:32:12,202 --> 00:32:13,360
MATT: Probably a good idea.

755
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,388
As a note though, you said within 6 miles?

756
00:32:14,388 --> 00:32:15,373
LAURA: Yes.

757
00:32:15,373 --> 00:32:16,798
SAM: 6 miles?!

758
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:19,477
MATT: As you continue tracking down this tunnel -

759
00:32:19,477 --> 00:32:23,099
and it takes you a good 3 or 4 hours to finally reach a point

760
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:25,779
where the tunnel begins to widen up -

761
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:30,997
you assess that, maybe 3 miles up,

762
00:32:30,997 --> 00:32:33,960
there is a localized town.

763
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,865
Or, at least, a population of duergar amassed 
in a central place.

764
00:32:38,865 --> 00:32:41,252
LIAM: Check out the brain on Brad!

765
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:43,045
LAURA: So 3 to 4 miles up, you said,

766
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:44,338
from where we are at this point?

767
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:47,243
MATT: Yeah. From where you began.

768
00:32:47,243 --> 00:32:48,603
TRAVIS: Should we be stealthing?

769
00:32:48,603 --> 00:32:49,795
LAURA: We should probably start stealthing 
at this point, yes.

770
00:32:49,795 --> 00:32:50,995
LIAM: Yes. I was about to say I'd like to move

771
00:32:50,995 --> 00:32:53,622
ahead of the group a bit and start sneaking along.

772
00:32:53,622 --> 00:32:54,747
MATT: Let's do that! Go ahead and roll stealth.

773
00:32:54,747 --> 00:32:57,262
LIAM: Do I have advantage like my sister had for--

774
00:32:57,262 --> 00:32:58,811
MATT: You do not.

775
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,083
LIAM: No. All right, well--

776
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:01,013
LAURA: Should we all try to stealth?

777
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:02,056
LIAM: 26 for me.

778
00:33:02,056 --> 00:33:03,663
MATT: This would be a group stealth check.

779
00:33:03,663 --> 00:33:05,608
LIAM: 26. I've tiptoed away.

780
00:33:09,746 --> 00:33:10,456
SAM: 19.

781
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:12,039
MARISHA: 15.

782
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:13,217
TALIESIN: 7.

783
00:33:13,217 --> 00:33:14,109
TRAVIS: 17.

784
00:33:14,109 --> 00:33:15,156
ASHLEY: 7.

785
00:33:15,156 --> 00:33:16,215
LAURA: 20.

786
00:33:16,215 --> 00:33:16,866
LIAM: 26.

787
00:33:16,866 --> 00:33:17,809
MATT: All right.

788
00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:18,980
ASHLEY: (laughs)

789
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,552
MATT: Picking up on the shortcomings of a handful of members

790
00:33:21,552 --> 00:33:24,479
of your group, you do manage to maintain what you feel is

791
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:30,102
a fairly stealthy advance deeper into this tunnel system.

792
00:33:30,102 --> 00:33:32,772
About an hour and a half of perpetual travel,

793
00:33:32,772 --> 00:33:35,414
as the tunnel slowly widens further and further,

794
00:33:35,414 --> 00:33:39,349
with every quarter mile or so, you eventually

795
00:33:39,349 --> 00:33:42,115
get to a point where the tunnel shoots open

796
00:33:42,115 --> 00:33:45,542
into a gargantuan cavern.

797
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:48,964
A chamber nearly a mile and a half across

798
00:33:48,964 --> 00:33:50,264
from this visual point.

799
00:33:50,264 --> 00:33:51,580
ASHLEY: (quietly)...of secrets?

800
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,349
MATT: It is extremely tall, with hundreds of very jagged

801
00:33:55,349 --> 00:33:57,737
stalagmites hanging from the ceiling,

802
00:33:57,737 --> 00:34:01,796
and rock formations that rise and fall at different points

803
00:34:01,796 --> 00:34:04,032
of the topography. This entire tunnel is built

804
00:34:04,032 --> 00:34:05,817
in this strange, large, natural,

805
00:34:05,817 --> 00:34:07,794
downward curve that disappears out of sight

806
00:34:07,794 --> 00:34:10,463
about a mile ahead and to the left.

807
00:34:10,463 --> 00:34:13,828
But this huge tunnel is lit with what looks like maybe

808
00:34:13,828 --> 00:34:19,594
2 to 3 dozen various small lava falls that are pouring

809
00:34:19,594 --> 00:34:25,009
down the sides of this giant cavern's structure.

810
00:34:25,009 --> 00:34:28,363
You also see some small pockets of that red glow stone

811
00:34:28,363 --> 00:34:33,568
that a lot of these Dwarven tunnels tend to use 
as a light source.

812
00:34:33,568 --> 00:34:38,237
You also, as you begin to step into this, carefully -

813
00:34:38,237 --> 00:34:42,427
you, taking point on this, both the twins; you notice -

814
00:34:42,427 --> 00:34:45,531
on the far end of this cavern…

815
00:34:50,098 --> 00:34:52,809
Well, first off, the entire landscape is rough and craggy,

816
00:34:52,809 --> 00:34:55,079
with large, black, obsidian spikes

817
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:56,780
just jutting out of the ground at various points.

818
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,829
Whether it be seismically created or otherwise,

819
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:01,370
it's a very unwelcoming atmosphere.

820
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:03,334
And that sulfurous smell is extremely strong.

821
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,032
Even though you’ve gotten used to it as far as you can

822
00:35:05,032 --> 00:35:07,311
for this travel, it’s still a very pungent odor

823
00:35:07,311 --> 00:35:09,037
and you find that it’s going to be very difficult for you

824
00:35:09,037 --> 00:35:12,556
to make out any other scent in this location right now

825
00:35:12,556 --> 00:35:14,450
other than that horrible mixture of chemicals that probably

826
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:17,118
isn’t very healthy to be breathing at the moment.

827
00:35:19,446 --> 00:35:21,882
What you see across the chamber, your eyes focus

828
00:35:21,882 --> 00:35:25,558
on a small cluster of buildings, it looks, of a similar construct

829
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:28,648
as the barracks that you saw at the war camp.

830
00:35:30,117 --> 00:35:32,274
You can probably surmise somewhere in the neighborhood

831
00:35:32,274 --> 00:35:33,893
of about 20 to 25 of these structures,

832
00:35:33,893 --> 00:35:36,992
all localized in this one area

833
00:35:36,992 --> 00:35:38,903
that is punctuated with -

834
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:42,439
you can count about 7 of these black obsidian spires

835
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:45,701
that rise out at different points around like watchtowers.

836
00:35:45,701 --> 00:35:46,780
LIAM: Still natural?

837
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,171
MATT: No, these are constructed.

838
00:35:48,171 --> 00:35:50,855
These are very smooth and have that

839
00:35:50,855 --> 00:35:52,467
rigid Dwarvish construction

840
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:58,767
with a jagged edge to each one of the leveled lips 
of these towers.

841
00:35:58,767 --> 00:36:02,066
The one that you can see closest to you, 
which is about a quarter mile off,

842
00:36:02,066 --> 00:36:04,076
you can just barely make out what looks like a couple of duergar

843
00:36:04,076 --> 00:36:06,282
walking across one of the upper levels

844
00:36:06,282 --> 00:36:08,991
and what looks like some sort of ballista and/or

845
00:36:08,991 --> 00:36:11,495
anti-personnel weapon that is put--

846
00:36:11,495 --> 00:36:12,797
LAURA: This is where Kima’s being held.

847
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:14,720
SAM: How do you know that?

848
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,010
LAURA: She had a vision.

849
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,644
ORION: Plus, it’s a really big thing.

850
00:36:17,644 --> 00:36:18,857
SAM: That’s true.

851
00:36:18,857 --> 00:36:21,512
MATT: These giant bolt-throwers currently reside on 
each one of these,

852
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:25,602
and then in the center of this cluster of buildings,

853
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:30,040
you see standing a gargantuan ebony fortress.

854
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,329
Serrated stonework marks the top of each wall

855
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:34,296
and more of these giant bolt-throwers

856
00:36:34,296 --> 00:36:36,100
are mounted across the parapets.

857
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,397
A massive magma fall descends from the rocky ceiling,

858
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:42,108
right above the stronghold, onto the roof

859
00:36:42,108 --> 00:36:46,579
and is forked onto each side and then continues to flow down,

860
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:50,145
buttressing each side of the stronghold almost as 
a defense mechanism,

861
00:36:50,145 --> 00:36:52,781
like they built it intentionally underneath this magma fall.

862
00:36:52,781 --> 00:36:53,634
SAM: Wow.

863
00:36:53,634 --> 00:36:55,446
LAURA: Oh, that’s where the trapdoor is!

864
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:56,712
SAM: What? Trapdoor?

865
00:36:56,712 --> 00:36:57,875
TRAVIS: There’s a trapdoor.

866
00:36:57,875 --> 00:36:58,736
LAURA: Yeah.

867
00:36:58,736 --> 00:36:59,570
MARISHA: Wait...under the magma?

868
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,370
LAURA: You missed a lot, Scanlan.
MARISHA: Oh, right.

869
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,181
SAM: I was with you the whole time.

870
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:04,531
ORION: Yes, but you were never paying attention.

871
00:37:04,531 --> 00:37:06,137
SAM: I was drunk.

872
00:37:06,137 --> 00:37:07,538
ORION: You got that new magazine and you’ve

873
00:37:07,538 --> 00:37:09,694
been staring at it a long time.

874
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,163
SAM: Well, it’s hot gnomes.

875
00:37:11,163 --> 00:37:15,684
LIAM: Vax creeps back to Pike and ushers her up to the front.

876
00:37:15,684 --> 00:37:20,739
Do you recall any of the details from your vision, 
from your dreams?

877
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,718
ASHLEY: I’ve definitely been here in my vision.

878
00:37:23,718 --> 00:37:25,936
(all laugh)

879
00:37:25,936 --> 00:37:28,286
ASHLEY: I do remember that much.

880
00:37:28,286 --> 00:37:31,704
All of this looks familiar,

881
00:37:31,704 --> 00:37:34,186
and I think we’re in the right place.

882
00:37:34,186 --> 00:37:35,439
LAURA: Sweet.

883
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:38,621
ORION: Very good. That’s all important.

884
00:37:38,621 --> 00:37:41,480
ASHLEY: Do we know what else is around?

885
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,391
What was the building again? With the--

886
00:37:43,391 --> 00:37:44,450
SAM: It’s a fortress.

887
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,734
MATT: The giant building you see is called Emberhold.

888
00:37:46,734 --> 00:37:48,314
That’s what it’s been referred to as.

889
00:37:48,314 --> 00:37:49,709
SAM: And it’s not a temple?

890
00:37:49,709 --> 00:37:50,909
MATT: It’s not a temple, it is a fortress.

891
00:37:50,909 --> 00:37:53,373
The temple of where apparently K'Varn

892
00:37:53,373 --> 00:37:54,958
as far as you know exists

893
00:37:54,958 --> 00:37:59,985
is further below in the fungal forest that

894
00:37:59,985 --> 00:38:01,666
surrounds this ancient city ruin

895
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:04,867
that has been repurposed by the illithids

896
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:06,997
that Clarota actually came from.

897
00:38:06,997 --> 00:38:11,973
LAURA: Oh, yes! And we know here, because the general

898
00:38:11,973 --> 00:38:15,668
that we mind melded - Clarota read his brain.

899
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,097
SAM: Yeah, I was there!

900
00:38:17,097 --> 00:38:18,888
LAURA: I know. It’s just you were drunk, so I’m reiterating it.

901
00:38:18,888 --> 00:38:20,153
(all laugh)

902
00:38:20,153 --> 00:38:21,477
SAM: Yeah yeah, good, thank you for that.

903
00:38:21,477 --> 00:38:23,391
ORION: Just making sure.

904
00:38:23,391 --> 00:38:25,262
TALIESIN: You had this very vivid look the whole time.

905
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:26,730
LAURA: So remember, Scanlan, that the general said

906
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,061
that on the left side of the fortress--

907
00:38:28,061 --> 00:38:29,203
SAM: Of the fortress.

908
00:38:29,203 --> 00:38:30,408
LAURA: --is how we can get into the trapdoor.

909
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,294
SAM: How we can get into the trapdoor, exactly.

910
00:38:32,294 --> 00:38:33,341
LIAM: By the smaller--

911
00:38:33,341 --> 00:38:35,077
SAM: Smaller--

912
00:38:35,077 --> 00:38:36,724
LIAM: --of two lava flows.
LAURA: By the smaller of two lava flows.

913
00:38:36,724 --> 00:38:37,626
SAM: --of two...what?

914
00:38:37,626 --> 00:38:39,161
LAURA: Lava flows.

915
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:40,329
ASHLEY: So what we’re looking at is the fortress?

916
00:38:40,329 --> 00:38:41,359
LAURA: Yes.

917
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:42,560
MATT: You’re looking at Emberhold itself,

918
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,845
the center of the duergar society and from what you’ve gleaned

919
00:38:44,845 --> 00:38:47,286
from two different duergar that you’ve interrogated,

920
00:38:47,286 --> 00:38:50,018
supposedly where Lady Kima has been held should she still--

921
00:38:50,018 --> 00:38:51,491
LAURA: by King Murghol?

922
00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:53,382
MATT: --By King Murghol.

923
00:38:53,382 --> 00:38:58,585
Murghol and Queen Ulara.

924
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:06,865
LIAM: From our vantage point can we see the two lava flows

925
00:39:06,865 --> 00:39:09,522
that we were warned about?

926
00:39:09,522 --> 00:39:10,959
MATT: It is way too far away.

927
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:12,810
That stronghold is probably a good mile and a half away 
from you right now.

928
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,581
LAURA: So, there is a lot of cover as we go near it

929
00:39:15,581 --> 00:39:16,833
because of all the…?

930
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:18,751
MATT: There is a lot of cover, yes, but it’s a lot 
of open area with cover,

931
00:39:18,751 --> 00:39:21,016
so it’s one of those you’re just going to have to be careful 
as you move through.

932
00:39:21,016 --> 00:39:21,883
SAM: Percy.

933
00:39:21,883 --> 00:39:23,374
LAURA: It’s pretty dark here, right?

934
00:39:23,374 --> 00:39:24,710
TALIESIN: Yes?

935
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,199
SAM: How long would it take you to make a nuclear weapon?

936
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,866
MATT: Yes, it’s pretty dark here, the only reason 
you can see much is because of the low light vision.

937
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,480
TALIESIN: A very long time. If I start it right now..

938
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,977
MATT: Even at this radius, things you could see nearby,

939
00:39:30,977 --> 00:39:32,605
a light source would be very helpful in making sure

940
00:39:32,605 --> 00:39:34,785
that you can see details and not fall in anything you 
don’t want to,

941
00:39:34,785 --> 00:39:37,841
but it also makes you very visible to anything else out there,

942
00:39:37,841 --> 00:39:38,980
so you have to decide.

943
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:43,223
LIAM: Between the lava and the red stones, the twins can see, 
correct?

944
00:39:43,223 --> 00:39:44,449
Because of the dim light.

945
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:46,336
MATT: You can see near, but these are things 
that are a mile away.

946
00:39:46,336 --> 00:39:47,332
LAURA: But nothing at a distance.

947
00:39:47,332 --> 00:39:48,008
LIAM: Right, right, right.

948
00:39:48,008 --> 00:39:49,325
MATT: It’s way too far away.

949
00:39:49,325 --> 00:39:52,811
The reason you can make out this small city and Emberhold itself

950
00:39:52,811 --> 00:39:55,657
is because there are clusters of the red glowstone

951
00:39:55,657 --> 00:39:58,434
used within that city and the giant magma fall

952
00:39:58,434 --> 00:40:01,245
that currently envelops the sides of the stronghold,

953
00:40:01,245 --> 00:40:03,921
making it very, very visible and easy to pick out

954
00:40:03,921 --> 00:40:06,047
against the rest of the cavern.

955
00:40:06,047 --> 00:40:07,327
ASHLEY: So this is a whole little city down here.

956
00:40:07,327 --> 00:40:08,192
LIAM: Yes.

957
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,169
MATT: About a mile off, yeah.

958
00:40:09,169 --> 00:40:10,537
LAURA: So we should keep to the left and head

959
00:40:10,537 --> 00:40:11,580
down that direction and try to--

960
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,141
MARISHA: I'm actually gonna go ahead and cast

961
00:40:13,141 --> 00:40:15,007
Pass Without A Trace.

962
00:40:15,007 --> 00:40:16,260
MATT: Okay.

963
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,673
SAM: (whispering) What does that do?

964
00:40:17,673 --> 00:40:19,573
MARISHA: (whispering) It makes us really stealthy.

965
00:40:19,573 --> 00:40:20,920
SAM: Oh, cool!

966
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,000
ORION: It's the thing that saved our butts last time.

967
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,029
LIAM: It quiets your parts.

968
00:40:24,029 --> 00:40:25,086
MATT: You've seen this before.

969
00:40:25,086 --> 00:40:27,143
As she finishes her incantation, you feel the darkness

970
00:40:27,143 --> 00:40:29,136
of the shadows around you begin to coalesce

971
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:30,822
and almost stick to you.

972
00:40:30,822 --> 00:40:32,382
Although there's no substance, for a moment you almost

973
00:40:32,382 --> 00:40:34,100
find yourself repulsed by it, until you realize

974
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,825
that it's probably an advantageous circumstance.

975
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:40,032
But you find yourself now much easier to slip 
into the surrounding shadows.

976
00:40:40,032 --> 00:40:41,325
MARISHA: They're nice shadows.

977
00:40:41,325 --> 00:40:42,704
TRAVIS: And I'm doing my flower girl routine

978
00:40:42,704 --> 00:40:44,617
with the dust of tracelessness.

979
00:40:44,617 --> 00:40:48,961
Just over here, over there, put a little on Pike.

980
00:40:48,961 --> 00:40:51,970
TALIESIN: We don't really need - Well...

981
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:54,506
TRAVIS: What? We've got a really large amount.

982
00:40:54,506 --> 00:40:55,812
ORION: You never know, Percy, he does it all the time.

983
00:40:55,812 --> 00:40:56,824
We don't know how many times it's saved us.

984
00:40:56,824 --> 00:40:58,037
MARISHA: (laughing) We've got a really large amount.

985
00:40:58,037 --> 00:40:59,202
TALIESIN: I suppose that's fair.

986
00:40:59,202 --> 00:41:00,891
SAM: What's our angle here, gents?

987
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,603
LIAM: We need to get closer up.

988
00:41:02,603 --> 00:41:05,545
We need to find this trap door, because it's suicide 
going in the front.

989
00:41:05,545 --> 00:41:07,447
LAURA: Right. And Lady Kima's being held here.

990
00:41:07,447 --> 00:41:09,160
SAM: So there's an entrance to this trap door that

991
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,582
possibly is on the outskirts of the city?

992
00:41:11,582 --> 00:41:12,354
LIAM &amp; LAURA: Yes.

993
00:41:12,354 --> 00:41:13,560
SAM: So we need to find it.

994
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,827
LAURA: Yes, it's on the left.

995
00:41:14,827 --> 00:41:16,080
SAM: Oh, it's on the left?

996
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,465
LAURA: Yes, so we're heading left and going--

997
00:41:17,465 --> 00:41:18,601
SAM: Let's do it!

998
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,295
LIAM: The twins will creep - continue ahead.

999
00:41:21,295 --> 00:41:23,513
ASHLEY: Yeah, you guys real stealthy, so--

1000
00:41:23,513 --> 00:41:25,057
TRAVIS: Yeah, keep creeping, keep creeping.

1001
00:41:25,057 --> 00:41:26,249
ASHLEY: --Probably smart that you're moving ahead.

1002
00:41:26,249 --> 00:41:27,829
MATT: Okay.

1003
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:30,036
ORION: I'll take point on the group that's following.

1004
00:41:30,036 --> 00:41:31,031
MATT: All right.

1005
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:32,919
LAURA: You guys take care of Trinket as I'm ahead of you.

1006
00:41:32,919 --> 00:41:34,342
ASHLEY: Come on, Trinket.

1007
00:41:34,342 --> 00:41:35,948
TRAVIS: (growling sounds) Me and Trinket are telling jokes

1008
00:41:35,948 --> 00:41:37,319
in the back of the group.

1009
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:38,785
SAM: Quietly.

1010
00:41:38,785 --> 00:41:40,861
MARISHA: Classic Trinket.

1011
00:41:40,861 --> 00:41:45,065
MATT: All right. You guys continue staying off the main path

1012
00:41:45,065 --> 00:41:47,661
and you can see there is about a 20-foot natural formation

1013
00:41:47,661 --> 00:41:52,094
of a walkway or at least where most of the patrols

1014
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:56,430
and any sort of duergar foot travel is localized.

1015
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,881
You can see where that natural road has been created 
over time.

1016
00:41:58,881 --> 00:42:01,005
You avoid that path and steer off to the left,

1017
00:42:01,005 --> 00:42:03,331
dodging between the various bits of terrain.

1018
00:42:03,331 --> 00:42:07,525
And it's a very rocky and difficult terrain

1019
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,662
should you not be with your ranger,

1020
00:42:09,662 --> 00:42:11,751
who has the Underdark as her favored terrain.

1021
00:42:11,751 --> 00:42:13,455
LAURA: Oh, I'll go back, then. Should I?

1022
00:42:13,455 --> 00:42:14,975
Or is it okay because we're all together?

1023
00:42:14,975 --> 00:42:16,863
MATT: It's okay because you guys are in theory together.

1024
00:42:16,863 --> 00:42:18,393
I'm going to say essentially you're just marking places

1025
00:42:18,393 --> 00:42:20,636
where the terrain would be dangerous, to watch your step

1026
00:42:20,636 --> 00:42:24,479
and to be wary of any locations that might be unsafe

1027
00:42:24,479 --> 00:42:26,742
for load bearing, anything like that.

1028
00:42:26,742 --> 00:42:29,503
TRAVIS: Yeah, I saw that look.

1029
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,766
You calling me load bearing?

1030
00:42:31,766 --> 00:42:32,825
(all laugh)

1031
00:42:32,825 --> 00:42:34,133
MATT: Yes!

1032
00:42:34,133 --> 00:42:37,414
TRAVIS: That's honest.

1033
00:42:37,414 --> 00:42:44,764
MATT: Specific. As you guys begin to curve around the left,

1034
00:42:44,764 --> 00:42:46,697
everyone roll a perception check real fast.

1035
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,506
SAM: Oh, snap.

1036
00:42:48,506 --> 00:42:52,007
TRAVIS: Prepare for a natural... lap.

1037
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:55,725
ORION: With our proficiency bonus?

1038
00:42:55,725 --> 00:42:58,245
MATT: Only if you're proficient with perception.

1039
00:42:58,245 --> 00:43:00,490
SAM: I can't read the dice.

1040
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:02,043
It's either a 6 or a 9. No idea.

1041
00:43:02,043 --> 00:43:02,809
ORION: 15.

1042
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:03,851
MATT: Is there a dot on the bottom?

1043
00:43:03,851 --> 00:43:04,688
SAM: Oh, that's the bottom?

1044
00:43:04,688 --> 00:43:05,558
MATT: Yeah.

1045
00:43:05,558 --> 00:43:07,033
SAM: It's a 6!

1046
00:43:07,033 --> 00:43:09,104
(all laugh)

1047
00:43:09,104 --> 00:43:10,710
ASHLEY: Oh, Scanlan!

1048
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:11,607
MARISHA: 16.

1049
00:43:11,607 --> 00:43:12,449
ORION: 15.

1050
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:13,146
TALIESIN: 24.

1051
00:43:13,146 --> 00:43:13,861
TRAVIS: 9.

1052
00:43:13,861 --> 00:43:14,588
ASHLEY: 19.

1053
00:43:14,588 --> 00:43:15,298
LAURA: 20.

1054
00:43:15,298 --> 00:43:16,144
LIAM: 25.

1055
00:43:16,144 --> 00:43:21,505
MATT: All right. Both Percy and Vax simultaneously

1056
00:43:21,505 --> 00:43:24,380
put their arms out to hold everyone back as you instinctively--

1057
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,242
LIAM: Dtdtdt!

1058
00:43:27,242 --> 00:43:32,050
MATT: --You hear a slight distant clanking of metal and voices.

1059
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:34,403
Low, kind of conversational voices.

1060
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,344
Too far for you to listen at this point.

1061
00:43:36,344 --> 00:43:38,275
But you guys immediately stop everyone.

1062
00:43:38,275 --> 00:43:41,871
And you can just see, over maybe a good 70, 80 feet

1063
00:43:41,871 --> 00:43:45,303
from your distance, heading up the path you guys 
had just began to skirt around,

1064
00:43:45,303 --> 00:43:48,312
a small, what looks like a roving patrol of duergar.

1065
00:43:48,312 --> 00:43:49,885
Probably the ones that go up and down the tunnel.

1066
00:43:49,885 --> 00:43:51,948
LAURA: I can ambush them!

1067
00:43:51,948 --> 00:43:52,963
SAM: Ambush them?

1068
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:53,861
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1069
00:43:53,861 --> 00:43:55,021
TALIESIN: (whispering) Let them pass.

1070
00:43:55,021 --> 00:43:56,322
SAM: Why don't we create a distraction and get rid of them?

1071
00:43:56,322 --> 00:43:58,102
LAURA: Well, okay, but I can - (whispering) I can be really quiet.

1072
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:00,514
I can do Hide In Plain Sight now.

1073
00:44:00,514 --> 00:44:02,251
So, I could completely hide myself standing there.

1074
00:44:02,251 --> 00:44:03,823
SAM: How many are there? Are you gonna kill--

1075
00:44:03,823 --> 00:44:05,163
MATT: No one's seen them, you can just hear them.

1076
00:44:05,163 --> 00:44:06,255
No one's gone to check.

1077
00:44:06,255 --> 00:44:07,335
LAURA: Oh! Can I look?

1078
00:44:07,335 --> 00:44:08,332
LIAM: Yes, let's go look.

1079
00:44:08,332 --> 00:44:09,151
MATT: You can.

1080
00:44:09,151 --> 00:44:09,982
LAURA: Okay, let's look.

1081
00:44:09,982 --> 00:44:10,924
LIAM: Let's go catch one.

1082
00:44:10,924 --> 00:44:12,094
MARISHA: (quietly) Can we not just hide?

1083
00:44:12,094 --> 00:44:13,874
MATT: Just the two of you?

1084
00:44:13,874 --> 00:44:16,616
ORION: How far away are we from them?

1085
00:44:16,616 --> 00:44:17,934
Like, in distance?

1086
00:44:17,934 --> 00:44:21,930
MATT: Right now? You're guessing about 80 to 70 feet, 
but closing fast.

1087
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:25,546
Not closing directly on you, because they're doing 
a slightly different path.

1088
00:44:25,546 --> 00:44:26,567
LAURA: (whispering) Everybody stay quiet.

1089
00:44:26,567 --> 00:44:27,841
TALIESIN: They're taking the path that we're not on, right?

1090
00:44:27,841 --> 00:44:28,789
MATT: Correct.

1091
00:44:28,789 --> 00:44:30,232
TALIESIN: So, if we hide--

1092
00:44:30,232 --> 00:44:31,299
LAURA: They won't find us.

1093
00:44:31,299 --> 00:44:32,237
TALIESIN: --They won't find us.

1094
00:44:32,237 --> 00:44:33,140
LAURA: Potentially.

1095
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,605
ORION: And they can just pass.

1096
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:35,865
LAURA: But I want to hear what they're saying.

1097
00:44:35,865 --> 00:44:37,969
MATT: Okay, so all of you guys, who's--

1098
00:44:37,969 --> 00:44:41,596
MARISHA: We'll all hide. I go ahead and cast

1099
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:44,198
Guidance on Vax.

1100
00:44:44,198 --> 00:44:45,491
LAURA: What does that mean?

1101
00:44:45,491 --> 00:44:46,207
LIAM: Vex.

1102
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,218
MATT: Is that a concentration spell?

1103
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:48,327
LAURA: I'm Vex, he's Vax.

1104
00:44:48,327 --> 00:44:49,252
We look alike, it's understandable.

1105
00:44:49,252 --> 00:44:51,532
MATT: Just checking if it’s concentration or not,

1106
00:44:51,532 --> 00:44:54,669
because that will definitely break your other spell.

1107
00:44:54,669 --> 00:44:55,992
I'll pull it up here real fast.

1108
00:44:55,992 --> 00:44:57,014
LAURA: Oh, no, then don't. Keep Pass Without A Trace.

1109
00:44:57,014 --> 00:44:58,601
TRAVIS: Well, we could just get this party started right here,
if we want to.

1110
00:44:58,601 --> 00:44:59,701
MARISHA: Let me see, it might just be--

1111
00:44:59,701 --> 00:45:01,107
MATT: Guidance is concentration.

1112
00:45:01,107 --> 00:45:02,545
MARISHA: No, sorry, you don't have my guidance.

1113
00:45:02,545 --> 00:45:04,091
LAURA: That's okay, that’s okay.

1114
00:45:04,091 --> 00:45:05,664
MARISHA: No guidance here.

1115
00:45:05,664 --> 00:45:06,938
LIAM: Why don't we go just up ahead and scout?

1116
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:08,919
LAURA: Just a little bit ahead and see what we can see.

1117
00:45:08,919 --> 00:45:12,028
MATT: Okay. So, the two of you kind of work up.

1118
00:45:18,107 --> 00:45:20,305
As the rest of you are holding back,

1119
00:45:20,305 --> 00:45:22,863
the twins slink between the various rock formations

1120
00:45:22,863 --> 00:45:25,739
and strange, jagged spires that are currently

1121
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:27,950
peppering this entire underground landscape.

1122
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:29,824
You get up to a point where you're maybe 10 feet

1123
00:45:29,824 --> 00:45:33,400
from the road and with your backs against the rock,

1124
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:38,182
you can begin to see the roving band slowly move around.

1125
00:45:38,182 --> 00:45:39,734
SAM: (whispering) Band?

1126
00:45:39,734 --> 00:45:42,824
MATT: The band of duergar.

1127
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:45,960
You count, at quick glance, roughly 12 to 15.

1128
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,459
MARISHA: Oh, yeah...

1129
00:45:47,459 --> 00:45:50,278
MATT: Armed with hammers, halberds, um...

1130
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:55,219
Both of you guys roll a perception check right now.

1131
00:45:55,988 --> 00:45:57,478
LIAM: Perception check.

1132
00:45:57,478 --> 00:45:59,032
MATT: Perception check. Specific for this one.

1133
00:46:01,243 --> 00:46:02,494
LIAM: 26.

1134
00:46:02,494 --> 00:46:03,563
LAURA: 17.

1135
00:46:03,563 --> 00:46:06,388
MATT: You make out that one of them holds no weapons.

1136
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,938
Instead is dressed in--

1137
00:46:07,938 --> 00:46:09,540
LAURA: Wait, no! I get advantage on perception,

1138
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,761
because I'm in my favored terrain.

1139
00:46:10,761 --> 00:46:11,779
MATT: There you go.

1140
00:46:11,779 --> 00:46:12,872
LIAM: I already perceived it.

1141
00:46:12,872 --> 00:46:14,251
LAURA: Oh, yeah, never mind, okay.

1142
00:46:14,251 --> 00:46:15,399
(all laugh)

1143
00:46:15,399 --> 00:46:17,189
MATT: You can also perceive, I suppose.

1144
00:46:17,189 --> 00:46:18,708
ORION: (whispering) I already perceived it.

1145
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:21,158
MATT: One of the duergar walking alongside is

1146
00:46:21,158 --> 00:46:24,537
completely bald on top with this extremely long,

1147
00:46:24,537 --> 00:46:29,900
well sculpted, black goatee beard that streams down.

1148
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,313
Thick black and red trimmed robes.

1149
00:46:32,313 --> 00:46:37,903
Carries no weapons and looks extremely dangerous.

1150
00:46:37,903 --> 00:46:40,092
However, as you're listening to the conversation,

1151
00:46:40,092 --> 00:46:42,933
you specifically, being able to understand 
Undercommon--

1152
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:44,478
LAURA: Yes.

1153
00:46:44,478 --> 00:46:46,970
LIAM: What is he saying?

1154
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,394
LAURA: Hold on.

1155
00:46:48,394 --> 00:46:50,157
MATT: --You pick up bits and pieces as they begin to pass by.

1156
00:46:50,157 --> 00:46:52,225
You hold your breath, hoping nobody notices you,

1157
00:46:52,225 --> 00:46:53,507
and so far so good.

1158
00:46:53,507 --> 00:46:57,570
They begin to walk slowly past the rock you guys are against.

1159
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:00,460
You overhear one of them say:

1160
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:04,673
“Well, keep your eyes peeled, eh. That thing is still out there.”

1161
00:47:04,673 --> 00:47:06,464
And the other one slaps him and says:

1162
00:47:06,464 --> 00:47:09,509
“Horek says that it ate a whole scouting party in seconds.”

1163
00:47:09,509 --> 00:47:10,928
Another one goes:

1164
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:13,085
“Listening to Horek was your first mistake.

1165
00:47:13,085 --> 00:47:15,227
“Shut up and keep walking.”

1166
00:47:15,227 --> 00:47:17,932
And they all keep pushing. At which point, the same

1167
00:47:17,932 --> 00:47:20,673
scared one from before says:

1168
00:47:20,673 --> 00:47:22,942
“I mean, if that one went crazy, well,

1169
00:47:22,942 --> 00:47:25,131
“can't the other ones crack, too?

1170
00:47:25,131 --> 00:47:31,029
“I don't know if I feel safe around any of K'varn's pets 
anymore at this rate.”

1171
00:47:31,029 --> 00:47:33,729
And by that point, they begin to slowly move past

1172
00:47:33,729 --> 00:47:35,159
and their voices begin to fade,

1173
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:37,107
as they continue up the path you guys just traversed down.

1174
00:47:37,107 --> 00:47:38,626
LAURA: (gasps)

1175
00:47:38,626 --> 00:47:39,930
MATT: Up to the lava tunnels.

1176
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:41,141
LAURA: Oh shit.

1177
00:47:41,141 --> 00:47:42,909
TRAVIS: Good thing I was clearing our footprints.

1178
00:47:42,909 --> 00:47:46,978
(all laugh)

1179
00:47:46,978 --> 00:47:48,518
MATT: It's actually a very good thing.

1180
00:47:48,518 --> 00:47:49,657
SAM: It's a win for Grog.

1181
00:47:49,657 --> 00:47:50,470
TRAVIS: (high-pitched voice) Is it?

1182
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:51,438
Did I do something good?

1183
00:47:51,438 --> 00:47:52,446
LIAM: Good job, dummy.

1184
00:47:52,446 --> 00:47:53,464
MARISHA: (laughing) Did I do something good?

1185
00:47:53,464 --> 00:47:54,377
MATT: You guys have, like,

1186
00:47:54,377 --> 00:47:58,099
bear tracks and a giant goliath, like, what-- (laughs)

1187
00:47:58,099 --> 00:48:00,913
ORION: These are amazing.

1188
00:48:00,913 --> 00:48:02,129
MARISHA: What are they?

1189
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,375
LAURA: Fried banana.

1190
00:48:03,375 --> 00:48:05,137
MARISHA: Oh! That's fun.

1191
00:48:05,137 --> 00:48:06,567
MATT: Fried bananas? Toss me one of those.

1192
00:48:06,567 --> 00:48:07,730
Is that from the chat?

1193
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:08,837
SAM: You're working. You don't have time to eat.

1194
00:48:08,837 --> 00:48:10,165
ZAC: (off screen) Yes, the chat room.

1195
00:48:10,165 --> 00:48:11,367
MATT &amp; LAURA: Thank you, chatroom.

1196
00:48:11,367 --> 00:48:12,538
MARISHA: Thank you.
ORION: Thanks so much.

1197
00:48:12,538 --> 00:48:13,903
MATT: I know it's not a piece of pizza, guys,

1198
00:48:13,903 --> 00:48:15,247
but I'll do what I can.

1199
00:48:15,247 --> 00:48:16,041
(all laugh)

1200
00:48:16,041 --> 00:48:17,358
SAM: Next time, sushi. Sushi.

1201
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:22,629
ZAC: (off screen) Instajur and somebody who didn't 
put their name on it.

1202
00:48:22,629 --> 00:48:23,573
MATT: (disappointed) Oh.

1203
00:48:23,573 --> 00:48:25,451
ORION: Instajur and mystery guy, thanks!

1204
00:48:25,451 --> 00:48:26,954
ZAC: Coleson sent the pizza.

1205
00:48:26,954 --> 00:48:29,760
ALL: Thank you!

1206
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,518
ASHLEY: Oh my god, that's so good.

1207
00:48:31,518 --> 00:48:33,167
MATT: The sound of the duergar walking eventually fades

1208
00:48:33,167 --> 00:48:34,668
and you feel pretty confident that

1209
00:48:34,668 --> 00:48:37,149
you're safe to return to the rest of the party.

1210
00:48:37,149 --> 00:48:39,204
LAURA: Okay. So, we walk back.

1211
00:48:39,204 --> 00:48:41,923
So, apparently, number one, big party,

1212
00:48:41,923 --> 00:48:44,470
we don't want to fight them if we don't have to.

1213
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:47,573
Secondly, there's some weirdo creature that's gotten loose

1214
00:48:47,573 --> 00:48:51,803
and is very, very bad and it's killed multiple duergar already.

1215
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,087
LIAM: Quickly.

1216
00:48:53,087 --> 00:48:55,146
LAURA: That might be the thing--

1217
00:48:55,146 --> 00:48:56,644
SAM: No indication of what kind of a creature it was?

1218
00:48:56,644 --> 00:48:58,676
LAURA: No, but it might be the thing we already killed.

1219
00:48:58,676 --> 00:49:01,059
It could've been the thing with the plate that 
showed up in the camp, I don't know.

1220
00:49:01,059 --> 00:49:02,114
SAM: The thing with the plate?

1221
00:49:02,114 --> 00:49:03,603
ASHLEY: The thing in the red rider wagon.
TRAVIS: The bullet, the bullet.

1222
00:49:03,603 --> 00:49:04,525
LAURA: The big thing.

1223
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:05,702
TRAVIS: Bulette.
MARISHA: Bulé.

1224
00:49:05,702 --> 00:49:06,952
SAM: Oh!
LAURA: It could've been that, I'm not sure.

1225
00:49:06,952 --> 00:49:08,213
TRAVIS: It's a French dog.

1226
00:49:08,213 --> 00:49:09,487
MARISHA: It’s French, yeah.

1227
00:49:09,487 --> 00:49:11,165
LAURA: Regardless, we should be very careful, 
traveling forward.

1228
00:49:11,165 --> 00:49:12,651
TALIESIN: I've seen your sheet, you don't speak French.

1229
00:49:12,651 --> 00:49:13,647
SAM: We could use that to our advantage.

1230
00:49:13,647 --> 00:49:15,309
ORION: We could! We could.

1231
00:49:15,309 --> 00:49:17,438
We could scare them off quite easily.

1232
00:49:17,438 --> 00:49:18,873
MARISHA: I had a grandmother who did, okay?

1233
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:21,487
LAURA: I like the way you think. All right.

1234
00:49:21,487 --> 00:49:22,855
ORION: I can make funny sounds.

1235
00:49:22,855 --> 00:49:24,065
LAURA: Should we keep moving forward

1236
00:49:24,065 --> 00:49:25,238
at a very stealthy sort of pace?

1237
00:49:25,238 --> 00:49:26,356
ORION: Waka waka.

1238
00:49:26,356 --> 00:49:27,748
MATT: Certainly.

1239
00:49:27,748 --> 00:49:28,931
TALIESIN: The stealthy mix.

1240
00:49:28,931 --> 00:49:30,806
MATT: You guys push forward, keeping that wide,

1241
00:49:30,806 --> 00:49:34,288
kind of left curve, which adds a fair amount of time

1242
00:49:34,288 --> 00:49:37,191
to your travel, as you're being careful and moving

1243
00:49:37,191 --> 00:49:43,114
at a very very heavy, circular arc around the duergar city.

1244
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:45,973
SAM: I'm looking for doors and stuff as we go.
I don't know why.

1245
00:49:45,973 --> 00:49:48,413
MATT: Sure! Looking for doors!

1246
00:49:48,413 --> 00:49:50,306
SAM: Well, there's a trap door somewhere, right?

1247
00:49:50,306 --> 00:49:52,136
ORION: (old man voice) There’s doors in them there caves.

1248
00:49:52,136 --> 00:49:53,341
MATT: Good thinking.

1249
00:49:53,341 --> 00:49:54,783
LIAM: That'll be the fortress, maybe, but--

1250
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:57,012
LAURA: Possibly. Could be farther. Can we see

1251
00:49:57,012 --> 00:50:00,123
the molten things that he was talking about?

1252
00:50:00,123 --> 00:50:01,353
The lava flows?

1253
00:50:01,353 --> 00:50:02,601
MATT: Still too far away.

1254
00:50:02,601 --> 00:50:04,219
LAURA: Still too far away.

1255
00:50:04,219 --> 00:50:05,499
MATT: As you begin to make your way around,

1256
00:50:05,499 --> 00:50:06,887
you're just starting to get to the point where you can see

1257
00:50:06,887 --> 00:50:08,966
the front of the fortress. And you can see where

1258
00:50:08,966 --> 00:50:14,100
the magma fall splits and just coalesces around 
each side of the stronghold.

1259
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,398
Almost like a blanket waterfall on each side.

1260
00:50:16,398 --> 00:50:20,113
It does split up at certain points, you can begin to start 
making it out.

1261
00:50:20,113 --> 00:50:22,467
TALIESIN: Where does the magma runoff lead to?

1262
00:50:22,467 --> 00:50:24,390
Does it just pour out? Does it fill a moat?

1263
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:26,232
MATT: It's hard to tell from this distance, unfortunately.

1264
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:28,926
You'd have to get closer up to see.

1265
00:50:28,926 --> 00:50:31,275
About an hour of travel around the side--

1266
00:50:31,275 --> 00:50:32,455
LAURA: Oh wow.

1267
00:50:32,455 --> 00:50:33,574
LIAM: I’m so bored.

1268
00:50:33,574 --> 00:50:36,095
LAURA: (laughs) Don't say that.

1269
00:50:36,095 --> 00:50:38,319
MATT: (laughs) That can be fixed, Liam.

1270
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:39,659
(all laugh)

1271
00:50:39,659 --> 00:50:41,088
TALIESIN: If only there were a way to just speed up

1272
00:50:41,088 --> 00:50:41,977
this exposition somehow.

1273
00:50:41,977 --> 00:50:43,529
TRAVIS: Of all the things.
MATT: Indeed.

1274
00:50:43,529 --> 00:50:46,166
TALIESIN: Life isn't like that.

1275
00:50:46,983 --> 00:50:48,637
ORION: Wow, Percy!

1276
00:50:48,637 --> 00:50:49,544
TALIESIN: Sorry.

1277
00:50:49,544 --> 00:50:51,254
(all laugh)

1278
00:50:51,254 --> 00:50:52,651
LAURA: (whispering) Be quiet.

1279
00:50:52,651 --> 00:50:56,704
MATT: It's at this point, immediately catching your eye, Vex,

1280
00:50:56,704 --> 00:51:03,614
one of the nearby obsidian spires is a different 
color than the rest.

1281
00:51:03,614 --> 00:51:06,814
The rest are like a deep black, glass shiny color.

1282
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:09,224
This one is a dull crimson.

1283
00:51:09,224 --> 00:51:12,121
LAURA: Ooh! We should go towards that one.

1284
00:51:12,121 --> 00:51:14,133
SAM: Because it's a different color?

1285
00:51:14,133 --> 00:51:15,748
LIAM: Let's go check it out.

1286
00:51:15,748 --> 00:51:17,199
MARISHA: Wait, what was the first color?

1287
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,538
I was still laughing at Percy. What?

1288
00:51:19,538 --> 00:51:21,633
LIAM: Just eat your banana, the twins 
will go check it out.

1289
00:51:21,633 --> 00:51:23,312
MATT: Black obsidian, this was red--

1290
00:51:23,312 --> 00:51:24,656
MARISHA: (laughing) Red, okay.

1291
00:51:24,656 --> 00:51:26,144
MATT: --crimson, ruddy, anyway.

1292
00:51:26,144 --> 00:51:27,268
TALIESIN: Do you not know anything?

1293
00:51:27,268 --> 00:51:28,322
LIAM: The twins are gonna go have a peek.

1294
00:51:28,322 --> 00:51:28,962
MATT: Okay.

1295
00:51:28,962 --> 00:51:30,140
SAM: I'm coming with.

1296
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,831
MATT: Scanlan comes with. Go ahead and roll a stealth check.

1297
00:51:31,831 --> 00:51:33,118
SAM: Oh boy. (laughs)

1298
00:51:33,118 --> 00:51:34,045
TALIESIN: I'm not coming with.

1299
00:51:34,045 --> 00:51:35,379
SAM: Not my strong suit.

1300
00:51:35,379 --> 00:51:36,469
TRAVIS: Don't fuck it up.

1301
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:37,751
LAURA: No, Scanlan, what did you do?

1302
00:51:37,751 --> 00:51:38,799
LIAM: You dick!

1303
00:51:38,799 --> 00:51:39,700
TRAVIS: Did you?

1304
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:40,657
MARISHA: What did you do?

1305
00:51:40,657 --> 00:51:42,038
(all laugh)

1306
00:51:42,038 --> 00:51:43,282
ORION: You can change your mind.

1307
00:51:43,282 --> 00:51:44,292
ASHLEY: Wait, wait, I go and--

1308
00:51:44,292 --> 00:51:45,745
SAM: I've got advantage, don't I?

1309
00:51:45,745 --> 00:51:47,741
ASHLEY: --I grab Scanlan and I kiss him on the cheek

1310
00:51:47,741 --> 00:51:48,839
and make him stay.

1311
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51,999
(all gasp and exclaim)

1312
00:51:51,999 --> 00:51:53,763
ORION: What?!

1313
00:51:53,763 --> 00:51:56,143
TALIESIN: Way to take one for the team.

1314
00:51:56,143 --> 00:51:57,442
ORION: Oh no.

1315
00:51:57,442 --> 00:51:58,334
TRAVIS: I don't know.

1316
00:51:58,334 --> 00:52:00,017
LIAM: You just stopped him from farting into his flute.

1317
00:52:00,017 --> 00:52:01,933
ASHLEY: Persuasion? That would be...

1318
00:52:01,933 --> 00:52:03,307
ORION: Ladies and gentlemen, this is a huge moment.

1319
00:52:03,307 --> 00:52:05,441
MARISHA: Can you roll a persuasion against a critical fail?

1320
00:52:05,441 --> 00:52:07,808
Can you? Can you persuade a crit fail?

1321
00:52:07,808 --> 00:52:09,224
LAURA: Can you persuade the DM?

1322
00:52:09,224 --> 00:52:10,335
ASHLEY: Wait, is it a fail?

1323
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:11,377
MARISHA: (laughing) Can you persuade the DM?

1324
00:52:11,377 --> 00:52:12,327
ASHLEY: It is a 1?

1325
00:52:12,327 --> 00:52:13,095
MATT: Okay, so it was a 1--

1326
00:52:13,095 --> 00:52:14,265
SAM: It was a 1.
LIAM: That's a 1 face.

1327
00:52:14,265 --> 00:52:15,208
(all laugh)

1328
00:52:15,208 --> 00:52:16,661
LIAM: That's a 1 face.

1329
00:52:18,878 --> 00:52:21,607
MATT: I will say, Pike, roll a perception check.

1330
00:52:25,087 --> 00:52:26,462
ORION: d20!

1331
00:52:26,462 --> 00:52:28,259
LAURA: Come on, come on, d20.

1332
00:52:28,259 --> 00:52:30,161
ASHLEY: Perception?

1333
00:52:30,161 --> 00:52:32,081
LIAM: Yes, d20. Uh, that's a half a d20.

1334
00:52:32,081 --> 00:52:33,262
ASHLEY: 14?

1335
00:52:33,262 --> 00:52:34,703
LAURA: (soft, high voice) No, no... yes, 14.

1336
00:52:34,703 --> 00:52:37,720
(all laugh)

1337
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:38,967
SAM: I don't know.

1338
00:52:38,967 --> 00:52:40,136
LAURA: I'll stop.

1339
00:52:40,136 --> 00:52:42,938
MATT: Unfortunately, you're not quite perceptive enough

1340
00:52:42,938 --> 00:52:45,583
to notice Scanlan's not quite so quiet walking away,

1341
00:52:45,583 --> 00:52:46,990
as you're distracted by the surroundings

1342
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:49,070
and the circumstance locally.

1343
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:51,861
You continue up with the twins,

1344
00:52:51,861 --> 00:52:54,859
absentmindedly humming to yourself.

1345
00:52:54,859 --> 00:52:56,944
SAM: (sings softly)

1346
00:52:56,944 --> 00:52:59,174
MATT: The twins, being used to your humming,

1347
00:52:59,174 --> 00:53:02,494
for some reason it doesn't connect.

1348
00:53:02,494 --> 00:53:04,888
You make your way up to the spire.

1349
00:53:04,888 --> 00:53:07,446
At about 15, 20 feet out, you notice

1350
00:53:07,446 --> 00:53:10,923
the coloration is different, because it is completely coated

1351
00:53:10,923 --> 00:53:14,462
in what looks like dried blood of some kind.

1352
00:53:14,462 --> 00:53:15,666
LIAM: Fuck.

1353
00:53:15,666 --> 00:53:16,704
LAURA: (gasps) Oh god.

1354
00:53:16,704 --> 00:53:18,432
MATT: And immediately to the right of it, along the ground--

1355
00:53:18,432 --> 00:53:19,835
ORION: So grossed out.

1356
00:53:19,835 --> 00:53:21,742
MATT: --currently your vision is obscured by another,

1357
00:53:21,742 --> 00:53:26,122
large kind of twisted stalactite, but there appears to be

1358
00:53:26,122 --> 00:53:30,197
an arm and a whole bunch more dried blood 
across the ground, just out of view.

1359
00:53:30,197 --> 00:53:31,642
LAURA: (gasps) Stop! Can we stop? Can we stop?

1360
00:53:31,642 --> 00:53:32,853
MATT: You can stop.

1361
00:53:32,853 --> 00:53:34,152
MARISHA: An arm?

1362
00:53:34,152 --> 00:53:35,366
LAURA: Scanlan. Shh.

1363
00:53:35,366 --> 00:53:36,375
SAM: What? What?

1364
00:53:36,375 --> 00:53:37,322
LAURA: (whispering) You're singing.

1365
00:53:37,322 --> 00:53:38,804
SAM: I was singing? (whispering) I was singing?

1366
00:53:38,804 --> 00:53:41,544
I didn't even know! It's a force of habit!

1367
00:53:41,544 --> 00:53:45,659
LIAM: I'm going to see if I can see anything in the area

1368
00:53:45,659 --> 00:53:48,419
that has done this recently.

1369
00:53:48,419 --> 00:53:50,569
LAURA: Is the arm attached to whatever did--

1370
00:53:50,569 --> 00:53:51,739
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1371
00:53:51,739 --> 00:53:53,048
LIAM: Investigation check?

1372
00:53:53,048 --> 00:53:54,754
LAURA: --Is the arm part of a dead thing or is it alive?

1373
00:53:54,754 --> 00:53:56,415
MATT: It's on the ground.

1374
00:53:56,415 --> 00:53:58,465
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure whatever it is, it's dead.

1375
00:53:58,465 --> 00:53:59,176
LIAM: 7.

1376
00:53:59,176 --> 00:54:00,107
MATT: 7?

1377
00:54:00,107 --> 00:54:01,680
LAURA: Can I check it out as well? I mean, I'm there, 
I might as well.

1378
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,983
MATT: You can also attempt to make an investigation check.

1379
00:54:02,983 --> 00:54:04,003
LIAM: Clever. There you go.

1380
00:54:04,003 --> 00:54:06,095
LAURA: Wait, I'm doing advantage, too, just in case.

1381
00:54:06,095 --> 00:54:07,595
Okay, that one's better.

1382
00:54:07,595 --> 00:54:09,023
LIAM: Oh, I can get advantage?

1383
00:54:09,023 --> 00:54:10,471
SAM: You get advantage on investigation?

1384
00:54:10,471 --> 00:54:12,234
LAURA: No, I got it because I'm fucking 
in my favored terrain.

1385
00:54:12,234 --> 00:54:13,049
(all laugh)

1386
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:13,883
LAURA: 21.

1387
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:15,872
MARISHA: You walk up in this terrain.

1388
00:54:15,872 --> 00:54:19,215
MATT: The state of the blood that you see around

1389
00:54:19,215 --> 00:54:24,347
seems to indicate that this has transpired over some time.

1390
00:54:24,347 --> 00:54:27,619
You're guessing probably within a few days, if not a week,

1391
00:54:27,619 --> 00:54:29,278
since this happened.

1392
00:54:29,278 --> 00:54:30,477
LIAM: I'm picking up one of the arms--

1393
00:54:30,477 --> 00:54:31,414
LAURA: (Gasps)

1394
00:54:31,414 --> 00:54:32,502
LIAM: --to bring back to the group.

1395
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:35,003
MATT: Okay, so as you walk up towards the arm to grab it,

1396
00:54:35,003 --> 00:54:36,796
you have more of a view of what's happened.

1397
00:54:36,796 --> 00:54:39,057
And what you see before you are definitely remnants

1398
00:54:39,057 --> 00:54:41,895
of some battle long past.

1399
00:54:41,895 --> 00:54:43,660
LAURA: This is the skelly pile.

1400
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,554
MATT: Against these rocky formations there's 
dried blood everywhere.

1401
00:54:45,554 --> 00:54:46,520
LIAM: Not pretty.

1402
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,024
MATT: This terrible bloodbath, whatever this event was,

1403
00:54:49,024 --> 00:54:51,717
it was probably a horrible thing to see.

1404
00:54:51,717 --> 00:54:54,201
There are pieces of duergar flung about.

1405
00:54:54,201 --> 00:54:57,088
And I say pieces - the only reason you know duergar

1406
00:54:57,088 --> 00:54:59,855
were there is because occasionally you see 
part of a head, or part of a foot.

1407
00:54:59,855 --> 00:55:02,441
And you recognize the ashy skin from the areas

1408
00:55:02,441 --> 00:55:05,219
that aren't currently caked with its own gore.

1409
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:07,558
LIAM: (gagging sounds)

1410
00:55:08,381 --> 00:55:12,548
MATT: From what you can tell, because of 
your investigation check,

1411
00:55:14,631 --> 00:55:17,084
the remains are torn apart by no blade.

1412
00:55:17,084 --> 00:55:22,686
There's no cuts, there's no clean wounds.

1413
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:25,212
They're either pulled apart by force--

1414
00:55:25,212 --> 00:55:26,549
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1415
00:55:26,549 --> 00:55:28,968
MATT: --like, arms and limbs were wrenched from the body

1416
00:55:28,968 --> 00:55:30,435
just out of sheer power.

1417
00:55:30,435 --> 00:55:31,839
TRAVIS: Like a Wookiee.

1418
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:35,208
MATT: Or there appears to be some sort of gnawing,

1419
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:38,073
some chewing, like toothy fangs, sharp teeth

1420
00:55:38,073 --> 00:55:41,143
have partially eaten portions of these bodies.

1421
00:55:41,143 --> 00:55:43,062
LIAM: This is the work of a beaver.

1422
00:55:43,062 --> 00:55:44,555
LAURA: Yes, definitely, a very large beaver.

1423
00:55:44,555 --> 00:55:46,026
ORION: A busy beaver.

1424
00:55:46,026 --> 00:55:47,462
SAM: I think it's suicide.

1425
00:55:47,462 --> 00:55:49,759
(all laugh)

1426
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:52,384
LAURA: Based on tracking and everything and insight,

1427
00:55:52,384 --> 00:55:56,376
can we tell if that creature is anywhere nearby? 
Or if it's gone?

1428
00:55:56,376 --> 00:55:57,714
ORION: I think it might be foul play, actually.

1429
00:55:57,714 --> 00:55:59,067
MATT: From what you can tell--

1430
00:55:59,067 --> 00:56:00,278
LIAM: It happened in the past.

1431
00:56:00,278 --> 00:56:02,347
MATT: --Yeah, it happened quite some time ago.

1432
00:56:02,347 --> 00:56:05,338
Looking at the tracks, you can see duergar feet,

1433
00:56:05,338 --> 00:56:07,830
you can see other creatures that resemble

1434
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:11,612
those hook horrors that you encountered earlier 
during the lava pool.

1435
00:56:11,612 --> 00:56:14,342
However, there's a series of tracks that you haven't seen.

1436
00:56:14,342 --> 00:56:19,986
Well, there is very erratic footsteps that look human size,

1437
00:56:19,996 --> 00:56:23,057
but they seem to be placed randomly,

1438
00:56:23,057 --> 00:56:25,111
like one foot here, one foot here, one foot here.

1439
00:56:25,111 --> 00:56:28,965
LAURA: (gasps) It's that big creature that - it was like
one of those things that that thing put together, like--

1440
00:56:28,965 --> 00:56:32,555
MATT: And you see what seem like strange strikes

1441
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,308
through the sand, like someone had been dragged

1442
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:38,319
very quickly in a very localized spot, scattered all about.

1443
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:40,698
LIAM: It's a human centipede.

1444
00:56:40,698 --> 00:56:42,572
SAM: It is. It's a human centipede.

1445
00:56:42,572 --> 00:56:44,867
MATT: It's a very strange pattern that you can't

1446
00:56:44,867 --> 00:56:47,455
really grasp what kind of creature would make it.

1447
00:56:47,455 --> 00:56:50,771
LAURA: And it seems like it was here recently,
or a while ago?

1448
00:56:50,771 --> 00:56:53,165
MATT: Best you can tell, the last time it was here was

1449
00:56:53,165 --> 00:56:57,221
about two or three days ago, to feast on more of the remains.

1450
00:56:57,221 --> 00:56:58,730
LIAM: Human? Human footprints?

1451
00:56:58,730 --> 00:56:59,818
LAURA: Should we get out of here?

1452
00:56:59,818 --> 00:57:00,735
MATT: Human sized.

1453
00:57:00,735 --> 00:57:01,600
LIAM: Human sized.

1454
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,674
TRAVIS: Or set a trap.

1455
00:57:02,674 --> 00:57:04,143
LAURA: We could try to set a trap, or we could

1456
00:57:04,143 --> 00:57:08,270
look and see if we can loot anything?

1457
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:09,892
Is there anything to loot?

1458
00:57:09,892 --> 00:57:11,639
Does it look like anything shiny?

1459
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:14,097
MATT: Any semblance of armor that belonged to any

1460
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:20,252
of these individuals is in such tatters that it's unusable.

1461
00:57:20,252 --> 00:57:24,033
You do manage to find, across some of the body parts,

1462
00:57:24,033 --> 00:57:27,670
a couple of blood-soaked gold coin purses.

1463
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:28,655
LAURA: Okay.

1464
00:57:28,655 --> 00:57:31,071
MARISHA: Take it.
LAURA: I like gold.

1465
00:57:31,071 --> 00:57:33,002
MATT: One of them contains a handful of gems.

1466
00:57:33,002 --> 00:57:34,081
LAURA: Ooh!

1467
00:57:34,081 --> 00:57:35,661
MARISHA: Gems.

1468
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:38,925
MATT: Yes, those right there. So you can mark that down,

1469
00:57:38,925 --> 00:57:42,424
until you get a chance to appraise them.

1470
00:57:42,424 --> 00:57:45,166
LIAM: I don't think we want to tangle with this.

1471
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:47,414
What are we trying to prove? 
Let's just keep trucking.

1472
00:57:47,414 --> 00:57:49,585
SAM: I'm really bad at stealthing, we should go.

1473
00:57:49,585 --> 00:57:51,463
(all laugh)

1474
00:57:51,463 --> 00:57:52,823
SAM: We should leave.

1475
00:57:52,823 --> 00:57:55,251
LIAM: Also, put the accordion back 
in the bag, all right?

1476
00:57:55,251 --> 00:58:00,911
SAM: Was I doing that? It's force of habit,
I don't - it's like breathing.

1477
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:02,387
LIAM: Yeah, we're going to go back to the group,

1478
00:58:02,387 --> 00:58:03,832
I'm going to bring the arm.

1479
00:58:03,832 --> 00:58:05,265
TRAVIS: I take out the cask of ale and pour

1480
00:58:05,265 --> 00:58:08,868
a little tankard of ale, just because I'm bored.

1481
00:58:08,868 --> 00:58:10,037
ASHLEY: Have a sip sip.

1482
00:58:10,037 --> 00:58:11,881
MATT: Good man. Well done. It's very tasty.

1483
00:58:11,881 --> 00:58:15,047
TRAVIS: Would anyone else like a sip? Keyleth?

1484
00:58:15,047 --> 00:58:17,477
MATT: Having been underground for what probably amounts

1485
00:58:17,477 --> 00:58:20,288
now to four or five days, that little 
taste of ale on your lips

1486
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:22,865
is a very welcoming and very refreshing sensation.

1487
00:58:22,865 --> 00:58:25,056
TRAVIS: It's good shit, right?

1488
00:58:25,056 --> 00:58:26,862
ASHLEY: Oh, delicious. Oh no, I'm drunk!
Just kidding.

1489
00:58:26,862 --> 00:58:28,494
(all laugh)

1490
00:58:28,494 --> 00:58:30,837
ASHLEY: That was fast! Just kidding.

1491
00:58:30,837 --> 00:58:31,925
LIAM: When we get back to the group,

1492
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,249
I'm going to toss the arm to Grog.

1493
00:58:33,249 --> 00:58:35,029
MATT: Grog, you instinctively reach up and catch it.

1494
00:58:35,029 --> 00:58:36,211
You look down and see what looks like

1495
00:58:36,211 --> 00:58:38,141
a duergar arm that has been very heavily mangled.

1496
00:58:38,141 --> 00:58:39,771
TRAVIS: Oh! Thanks for the hand!

1497
00:58:39,771 --> 00:58:42,239
(all laugh)

1498
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:43,596
LIAM: It's a back scratcher.

1499
00:58:43,596 --> 00:58:44,859
ORION: That was clever, Grog!

1500
00:58:44,859 --> 00:58:46,049
LAURA: Well, we killed a lot of duergar this time.

1501
00:58:46,049 --> 00:58:47,515
TRAVIS: Don't negative anything. It was a good joke.

1502
00:58:47,515 --> 00:58:48,453
(all laugh)

1503
00:58:48,453 --> 00:58:50,645
MATT: It was a good joke. I considered it, but no.

1504
00:58:50,645 --> 00:58:51,714
TRAVIS: Have mercy!

1505
00:58:51,714 --> 00:58:53,615
ORION: That was a good joke.

1506
00:58:53,615 --> 00:58:56,420
LAURA: There's a big centipede-y 
human, creepy creature

1507
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:57,945
that's killed a lot of things and we should probably

1508
00:58:57,945 --> 00:58:59,994
avoid that at all costs.

1509
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,337
ORION: I would agree with that.

1510
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:02,641
LIAM: If we have to, we will, but--

1511
00:59:02,641 --> 00:59:03,975
TALIESIN: That seems fair.

1512
00:59:03,975 --> 00:59:07,059
LAURA: Can we avoid that and still 
head left of the keep?

1513
00:59:07,059 --> 00:59:08,551
MATT: You haven't seen a creature.

1514
00:59:08,551 --> 00:59:10,245
SAM: Wait, we didn't make it into the -

1515
00:59:10,245 --> 00:59:12,176
was there a structure that we could have entered?

1516
00:59:12,176 --> 00:59:13,295
LAURA: That's where we're going.

1517
00:59:13,295 --> 00:59:14,742
LIAM &amp; MATT: You're heading towards that structure.

1518
00:59:14,742 --> 00:59:15,973
SAM: Okay. But I mean, where we just were?

1519
00:59:15,973 --> 00:59:17,040
ORION: The magma fortress.

1520
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,243
MATT: Where you just were? No, there's just all these

1521
00:59:18,243 --> 00:59:19,774
giant rocky spires jutting out of the ground.

1522
00:59:19,774 --> 00:59:21,025
LIAM: Spike coated in dried blood.

1523
00:59:21,025 --> 00:59:22,195
SAM: They didn't have doors in them?

1524
00:59:22,195 --> 00:59:23,427
LAURA: Should we probably have looked for like a nest?

1525
00:59:23,427 --> 00:59:24,262
MATT: There were no doors.

1526
00:59:24,262 --> 00:59:25,241
SAM: Okay, good. I'm looking for a door!

1527
00:59:25,241 --> 00:59:26,561
LIAM: No, we should just keep going.

1528
00:59:26,561 --> 00:59:27,811
If we're going to run into it, we're going to run into it.

1529
00:59:27,811 --> 00:59:28,566
Let's not find it.

1530
00:59:28,566 --> 00:59:29,688
LAURA: Yeah.

1531
00:59:29,688 --> 00:59:31,177
MATT: It appears like there was, at one point in time,

1532
00:59:31,177 --> 00:59:32,381
some very intense seismic activity in this area that

1533
00:59:32,381 --> 00:59:33,694
created this cavern, and whatever is the source

1534
00:59:33,694 --> 00:59:37,280
of a lot of this perpetually flowing, molten rock.

1535
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,980
That's why the entire terrain here is so dangerous and uninviting,

1536
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:45,726
is because of the sheer force that went into its creation.

1537
00:59:45,726 --> 00:59:46,653
SAM: Okay.

1538
00:59:46,653 --> 00:59:48,513
LAURA: So we should just keep freaking being careful

1539
00:59:48,513 --> 00:59:49,752
and keep going towards the giant thing.

1540
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:50,715
SAM: Okay. Let's go.

1541
00:59:50,715 --> 00:59:51,630
ASHLEY: Keep trucking on.

1542
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:53,949
SAM: Pike, I have this weird feeling,

1543
00:59:53,949 --> 00:59:56,528
like you wanted to make out with me.

1544
00:59:56,528 --> 00:59:59,325
Is that something that happened? 
Am I dreaming?

1545
00:59:59,325 --> 01:00:02,189
ASHLEY: Well, you just, you know, you weren't
paying attention.

1546
01:00:02,189 --> 01:00:03,372
SAM: Really?

1547
01:00:03,372 --> 01:00:04,903
LAURA: And that makes you want to 
make out with him?

1548
01:00:04,903 --> 01:00:07,922
ASHLEY: No, I think you were moving 
along to try to go stealth

1549
01:00:07,922 --> 01:00:11,482
and sometimes you should just stay 
put and see what happens.

1550
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:13,476
(all laugh)

1551
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:16,209
ORION: Well said, cleric!

1552
01:00:16,209 --> 01:00:19,068
LIAM: That was the most adorable diss in history.

1553
01:00:19,068 --> 01:00:21,083
(all laugh)

1554
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:22,124
TALIESIN: That was cold.

1555
01:00:22,124 --> 01:00:23,287
SAM: All right.

1556
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:24,298
ORION: Yet inviting.

1557
01:00:24,298 --> 01:00:26,126
TRAVIS: It's all right, Scanlan. 
We'll go pay for it later.

1558
01:00:26,126 --> 01:00:28,428
(all laugh)

1559
01:00:28,428 --> 01:00:30,623
MATT: A small hit to Scanlan's morale,

1560
01:00:30,623 --> 01:00:33,415
but the party marches on.

1561
01:00:33,415 --> 01:00:35,340
LIAM: You lose an inspiration die.

1562
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,256
(all laugh)

1563
01:00:36,256 --> 01:00:38,731
TRAVIS: Disadvantage on whatever roll.

1564
01:00:40,291 --> 01:00:41,701
SAM: I deserved it, I deserved it.

1565
01:00:41,701 --> 01:00:43,737
LIAM: Okay, twins in front, here we go.

1566
01:00:43,737 --> 01:00:44,654
LAURA: Let's keep going.

1567
01:00:44,654 --> 01:00:46,755
MATT: Twins in front. You guys 
continue to push forward.

1568
01:00:46,755 --> 01:00:48,763
For the sake of the length of this journey,

1569
01:00:48,763 --> 01:00:50,134
I'm going to have the party go ahead and

1570
01:00:50,134 --> 01:00:52,510
roll a communal stealth check once more.

1571
01:00:53,893 --> 01:00:55,395
MARISHA: I still have Pass Without A Trace up.

1572
01:00:55,395 --> 01:00:56,704
TALIESIN: Oh, for the love of god.

1573
01:00:56,704 --> 01:00:58,181
MARISHA: Which gives everyone a plus 10.

1574
01:00:58,181 --> 01:00:59,595
LAURA: Oh, really?!

1575
01:00:59,595 --> 01:01:00,691
MATT: Yes.

1576
01:01:00,691 --> 01:01:01,767
LIAM: Percy! Don't bang the guns together.

1577
01:01:01,767 --> 01:01:03,148
TALIESIN: Yeah, that happened too.

1578
01:01:03,148 --> 01:01:04,006
ORION: 24.

1579
01:01:04,006 --> 01:01:04,733
MATT: 24?

1580
01:01:04,733 --> 01:01:05,478
SAM: 19.

1581
01:01:05,478 --> 01:01:06,306
LIAM: We all have plus 10?

1582
01:01:06,306 --> 01:01:06,937
MATT: Yes.

1583
01:01:06,937 --> 01:01:07,634
LAURA: And this is plus 10, already?

1584
01:01:07,634 --> 01:01:08,389
SAM: Yes.

1585
01:01:08,389 --> 01:01:09,437
TALIESIN: I rolled a 1.

1586
01:01:09,437 --> 01:01:10,205
MATT: Okay.

1587
01:01:10,205 --> 01:01:11,928
(all groan)

1588
01:01:11,928 --> 01:01:12,658
LAURA: Oh, Percy!

1589
01:01:12,658 --> 01:01:13,813
SAM: I kiss Percy!

1590
01:01:13,813 --> 01:01:15,069
(all laugh)

1591
01:01:15,069 --> 01:01:16,799
TALIESIN: What?! Ah!

1592
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:19,399
SAM: I don’t know! I thought it might help.

1593
01:01:19,399 --> 01:01:21,527
ORION: You have to use the tongue, Scanlan.

1594
01:01:21,527 --> 01:01:22,895
MARISHA: 23.

1595
01:01:22,895 --> 01:01:24,404
SAM: Is that bubblegum?

1596
01:01:24,404 --> 01:01:25,186
MATT: Okay. Grog?

1597
01:01:25,186 --> 01:01:25,838
TRAVIS: 26.

1598
01:01:25,838 --> 01:01:26,790
ASHLEY: 3.

1599
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:28,121
TALIESIN: I have a habit.

1600
01:01:28,121 --> 01:01:29,030
LAURA: (gasps) You have a plus 10.

1601
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:29,972
ASHLEY: Oh! I get to do plus 10 bonus to that?
MATT: Yes.

1602
01:01:29,972 --> 01:01:30,972
ASHLEY: 13!

1603
01:01:30,972 --> 01:01:31,933
MATT: All right, so that's three failures.

1604
01:01:31,933 --> 01:01:32,874
LAURA: 30.

1605
01:01:32,874 --> 01:01:33,611
MARISHA: Three failures?

1606
01:01:33,611 --> 01:01:34,335
LIAM: 32.

1607
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,296
MATT: Okay, good.

1608
01:01:35,296 --> 01:01:36,167
TALIESIN: (relieved) Ah!

1609
01:01:36,167 --> 01:01:37,465
MATT: More than half you guys succeeded.

1610
01:01:37,465 --> 01:01:39,636
That bit is key. A one is two failures.

1611
01:01:39,636 --> 01:01:41,118
LAURA: Oh no!

1612
01:01:41,118 --> 01:01:42,328
ASHLEY: I'm not stealthy, man.

1613
01:01:42,328 --> 01:01:43,466
MARISHA: A one is two failures?

1614
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,572
MATT: A one is considered two failures for this challenge.

1615
01:01:45,572 --> 01:01:46,823
Pushing forward--

1616
01:01:46,823 --> 01:01:47,699
TALIESIN: Now you roll well.

1617
01:01:47,699 --> 01:01:49,385
MATT: --you manage to stop Percy and find out

1618
01:01:49,385 --> 01:01:53,083
the root of this audio problem.

1619
01:01:53,083 --> 01:01:54,778
Pushing forward, you manage to make your way

1620
01:01:54,778 --> 01:01:59,604
about a quarter mile on the outskirts of this cluster of buildings.

1621
01:01:59,604 --> 01:02:03,995
Curving far left, you're just managing to keep out of the city proper

1622
01:02:03,995 --> 01:02:07,927
and move straight towards the very back wall of this cavern,

1623
01:02:07,927 --> 01:02:13,083
which is buttressed against - 
what this fortress is built against.

1624
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:17,290
So you're circumventing the city to go 
straight to this fortress.

1625
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:23,398
As you're moving, about a quarter mile 
from the stronghold,

1626
01:02:23,398 --> 01:02:29,429
Vex, you pick up a strange person

1627
01:02:29,429 --> 01:02:32,894
standing maybe about 50, 60 feet ahead of you.

1628
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:35,733
LAURA: Just a person?

1629
01:02:35,733 --> 01:02:38,306
MATT: Just a person, it looks like.

1630
01:02:38,306 --> 01:02:40,495
LAURA &amp; ORION: (worried laughter)

1631
01:02:40,495 --> 01:02:42,421
LAURA: Can they see us? Does it look like they
can see us?

1632
01:02:42,421 --> 01:02:44,258
MATT: You take a moment, keeping an eye out,

1633
01:02:44,258 --> 01:02:48,244
and the person isn't moving. Just standing right there.

1634
01:02:48,244 --> 01:02:51,535
LAURA: (whispering) So. There's a person standing right there.

1635
01:02:51,535 --> 01:02:52,986
MARISHA: (whispering) What?

1636
01:02:52,986 --> 01:02:54,597
LAURA: (whispering) A person. He's just standing there.

1637
01:02:54,597 --> 01:02:56,414
MATT: It's too dark to make out any details, unfortunately.

1638
01:02:56,414 --> 01:02:58,291
LAURA: No. Hmm.

1639
01:02:58,291 --> 01:02:59,742
SAM: Could be good, could be bad. 
We have no idea.

1640
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:03,581
LIAM: Can I see him now that she's 
pointed him out to me?

1641
01:03:03,581 --> 01:03:04,584
SAM: I can hold him. Might piss him off.

1642
01:03:04,584 --> 01:03:05,668
TRAVIS: At least do the hold.

1643
01:03:05,668 --> 01:03:06,556
MATT: You can see it.

1644
01:03:06,556 --> 01:03:07,900
And there is a humanoid, standing on its own.

1645
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,888
LIAM: It doesn't seem to be moving, though.

1646
01:03:09,888 --> 01:03:11,825
LAURA: Maybe it's a scarecrow?
LIAM: Maybe it's a statue.

1647
01:03:11,825 --> 01:03:12,755
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I mean.

1648
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:13,690
TRAVIS: A statue?

1649
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:14,495
SAM: Want me to go check it out?

1650
01:03:14,495 --> 01:03:15,529
LIAM: No! I don’t!

1651
01:03:15,529 --> 01:03:16,609
LAURA: Can't you go invisible?

1652
01:03:16,609 --> 01:03:17,977
SAM: Yes, I can go invisible.

1653
01:03:17,977 --> 01:03:19,825
LAURA: Go invisible and check it out.

1654
01:03:19,825 --> 01:03:24,517
SAM: I polymorph and turn into a fly and I buzz over.

1655
01:03:24,517 --> 01:03:26,033
MARISHA: Oh, yay! That's fun.

1656
01:03:26,033 --> 01:03:27,837
LIAM: Good job, gnome nuts.

1657
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:30,623
LAURA: Oh no, if he's magic, he's going to know.

1658
01:03:30,623 --> 01:03:34,468
SAM: It's all right. I've got magic, too.

1659
01:03:36,588 --> 01:03:39,887
MATT: You approach this individual and 
notice it is unmoving

1660
01:03:39,887 --> 01:03:42,701
and is of a singular, solid color.

1661
01:03:42,701 --> 01:03:44,121
LAURA: (whispering) It's a statue.

1662
01:03:44,121 --> 01:03:48,417
MATT: What looks to be what is an illithid 
or a mind flayer

1663
01:03:48,417 --> 01:03:52,899
is currently locked in some sort of reactionary position,

1664
01:03:52,899 --> 01:03:54,568
but is completely turned to stone.

1665
01:03:54,568 --> 01:03:55,825
LAURA: Oh no!

1666
01:03:55,825 --> 01:03:56,813
MARISHA: Oh shit.

1667
01:03:56,813 --> 01:03:58,170
SAM: Like a Medusa type of a thing?

1668
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:01,880
LIAM: We faced basilisks once and they did this to Vex'ahlia.

1669
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,271
TRAVIS: We've got basilisk eggs.

1670
01:04:03,271 --> 01:04:04,740
MARISHA: There's a lot of things that can do this, 
actually, to be fair.

1671
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,379
LAURA: We do have basilisk eggs in the bag of holding.

1672
01:04:06,379 --> 01:04:07,825
TRAVIS: Yeah, we’ve got eight of them.

1673
01:04:07,825 --> 01:04:11,038
Maybe we should crack one on statue guy.

1674
01:04:11,038 --> 01:04:16,164
SAM: I buzz back to the group. (buzzing)

1675
01:04:16,164 --> 01:04:18,179
LAURA: Oh, what's that? Oh, it's Scanlan.

1676
01:04:18,179 --> 01:04:20,183
SAM: I kind of fuck with Tiberius's ear a little bit.

1677
01:04:20,183 --> 01:04:21,289
(all laugh)

1678
01:04:21,289 --> 01:04:22,697
ORION: Oh, Scanlan, stop it!

1679
01:04:22,697 --> 01:04:23,994
SAM: And I turn back.

1680
01:04:23,994 --> 01:04:25,029
(all laugh)

1681
01:04:25,029 --> 01:04:26,279
TRAVIS: Well, what did you see?

1682
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:27,193
LAURA: What was it?

1683
01:04:27,193 --> 01:04:28,864
SAM: A crazy statue of a crazy illithid.

1684
01:04:28,864 --> 01:04:30,655
LIAM: That's crazy.

1685
01:04:30,655 --> 01:04:32,568
LAURA: Can we look at Clarota and say:

1686
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:34,897
“Do you know anything about this?”

1687
01:04:34,897 --> 01:04:37,200
MATT: Clarota kind of thinks for a second and goes:

1688
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:42,458
(breathy, raspy voice) “As far as I've noticed, occasionally

1689
01:04:42,458 --> 01:04:50,235
“these patrols do walk with a lizard creature that 
has this ability.

1690
01:04:50,235 --> 01:04:55,874
“It's generally used as a threatening device

1691
01:04:55,874 --> 01:04:59,992
“or a guardian amongst the city.”

1692
01:04:59,992 --> 01:05:02,027
MARISHA: Oh! So the duergar--

1693
01:05:02,027 --> 01:05:03,540
LAURA: Have basilisks.

1694
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:06,524
MARISHA: --have this as, like, their pets?

1695
01:05:06,524 --> 01:05:08,999
MATT: “A trained beast, yes.”

1696
01:05:08,999 --> 01:05:13,167
LIAM: Why do you suppose they used it 
on one of their own?

1697
01:05:13,167 --> 01:05:16,634
MATT: “I can only imagine maybe this transpired

1698
01:05:16,634 --> 01:05:22,475
“before the union and is left as a warning.”

1699
01:05:22,475 --> 01:05:24,210
LIAM: So it's a duergar pet?

1700
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:26,086
LAURA: Do we remember how to take care of basilisks?

1701
01:05:26,086 --> 01:05:27,837
Like, do we not look at them, is that how they don't--

1702
01:05:27,837 --> 01:05:29,865
LIAM: Don't look at them. That's correct.

1703
01:05:29,865 --> 01:05:31,722
LAURA: Don't look them in the eye?
Or don't look at their face?

1704
01:05:31,722 --> 01:05:33,011
LIAM: Yes, that's it. It's a vision thing.

1705
01:05:33,011 --> 01:05:34,689
LAURA: Yes?
TALIESIN: Yes, I believe it's vision based.

1706
01:05:34,689 --> 01:05:35,572
LAURA: Okay.

1707
01:05:35,572 --> 01:05:37,335
MATT: This would be a nature check.

1708
01:05:37,335 --> 01:05:38,537
TALIESIN: Double check.

1709
01:05:38,537 --> 01:05:39,860
MATT: For anyone who wishes to make one.

1710
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:41,242
MARISHA: I'll do that.

1711
01:05:41,242 --> 01:05:42,210
TRAVIS: Me too.

1712
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:43,059
(all laugh)

1713
01:05:43,059 --> 01:05:44,161
TALIESIN: 23. Natural 20.

1714
01:05:44,161 --> 01:05:45,286
LAURA: Oh, well, never mind. He's got it.

1715
01:05:45,286 --> 01:05:46,572
ORION: Very good, yay!

1716
01:05:46,572 --> 01:05:48,033
MARISHA: Oh, well, I'll stop there.

1717
01:05:48,033 --> 01:05:49,226
TRAVIS: Just go ahead and dunk on everybody, 
why don't you?

1718
01:05:49,226 --> 01:05:50,275
MATT: Natural 20.

1719
01:05:54,205 --> 01:05:57,829
Essentially it is a sight-based circumstance.

1720
01:05:57,829 --> 01:06:01,345
TALIESIN: It's entirely visual. They have to catch your gaze

1721
01:06:01,345 --> 01:06:04,345
and then that is how they can turn you into stone.

1722
01:06:04,345 --> 01:06:07,146
Otherwise, as long as you don't catch
their gaze, you'll be fine.

1723
01:06:07,146 --> 01:06:08,242
LAURA: All right.

1724
01:06:08,242 --> 01:06:09,602
LIAM: All right. It's a good thing we've all been watching

1725
01:06:09,602 --> 01:06:10,761
Daredevil last week.

1726
01:06:10,761 --> 01:06:12,405
TRAVIS: So, look them in the eye? Got it.

1727
01:06:12,405 --> 01:06:13,351
(all laugh)

1728
01:06:13,351 --> 01:06:14,608
TALIESIN: Yes! Very helpful.

1729
01:06:14,608 --> 01:06:16,146
TRAVIS: Let's go.

1730
01:06:16,146 --> 01:06:18,807
MARISHA: Poor basilisks. Can never make eye contact.

1731
01:06:18,807 --> 01:06:19,882
SAM: We're going on?

1732
01:06:19,882 --> 01:06:20,765
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1733
01:06:20,765 --> 01:06:21,729
LAURA: Yeah, let's keep going.

1734
01:06:21,729 --> 01:06:25,040
MATT: As you guys push forward, Clarota lags 
behind a little bit to inspect the statue.

1735
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,496
Kind of looks it over for a second--

1736
01:06:26,496 --> 01:06:28,458
LAURA: Did you know him?

1737
01:06:28,458 --> 01:06:30,331
MATT: (low, breathy voice) “Uh…”

1738
01:06:30,331 --> 01:06:31,651
SAM: Dave.

1739
01:06:31,651 --> 01:06:33,709
MATT: (laughing) Goddamn it!

1740
01:06:33,709 --> 01:06:35,464
(all laugh)

1741
01:06:35,464 --> 01:06:39,098
ORION: I don't think his name was Dave, Scanlan.

1742
01:06:39,098 --> 01:06:40,836
MATT: He takes a moment to look over and you can see

1743
01:06:40,836 --> 01:06:43,381
his eyes close slightly for a second.

1744
01:06:43,381 --> 01:06:46,130
(raspy, breathy voice) “Aye, we've met.

1745
01:06:46,130 --> 01:06:51,871
“Not the kindest of my people, but, nevertheless,

1746
01:06:51,871 --> 01:06:55,710
“should all this pass, I would like to, maybe,

1747
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:59,386
“release him from this stony prison.”

1748
01:06:59,386 --> 01:07:01,513
LAURA: So you know how to do that?

1749
01:07:01,513 --> 01:07:04,408
MATT: “I know not, but it can be done. I've seen it.”

1750
01:07:04,408 --> 01:07:05,501
LAURA: Didn't we do that?

1751
01:07:05,501 --> 01:07:06,255
ORION: Yes.

1752
01:07:06,255 --> 01:07:07,683
LAURA: Didn't we have to do that?

1753
01:07:07,683 --> 01:07:10,147
LIAM: We sprinkled some of its blood on your eyes,

1754
01:07:10,147 --> 01:07:11,591
if I remember correctly.

1755
01:07:11,591 --> 01:07:12,464
ORION: Yes!

1756
01:07:12,464 --> 01:07:13,388
LAURA: I turned to stone?

1757
01:07:13,388 --> 01:07:14,347
MATT: You did.

1758
01:07:14,347 --> 01:07:15,680
LIAM: You did. I was very sad.

1759
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,196
ORION: Yes, that's correct. 
We used the blood of the creature.

1760
01:07:17,196 --> 01:07:18,862
LAURA: I remember, I remember. 
Yeah, I remember that.

1761
01:07:18,862 --> 01:07:20,819
MATT: Essentially, there is a liquid that can be

1762
01:07:20,819 --> 01:07:24,173
distilled from the basilisk blood.

1763
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:25,532
LAURA: Okay.

1764
01:07:25,532 --> 01:07:27,542
TRAVIS: We don't have any more of that.

1765
01:07:27,542 --> 01:07:28,727
MATT: You do not.

1766
01:07:28,727 --> 01:07:29,999
LAURA: Okay. So we'll be careful.

1767
01:07:29,999 --> 01:07:31,064
TRAVIS: Dragon blood for fucking days.

1768
01:07:31,064 --> 01:07:32,275
LIAM: We also don't know if it's a basilisk.

1769
01:07:32,275 --> 01:07:34,058
SAM: Should we move this statue off to a safe place,

1770
01:07:34,058 --> 01:07:35,393
inside or anything?

1771
01:07:35,393 --> 01:07:36,467
LAURA: Nah, fuck it.
SAM: It's fine here, it's fine.

1772
01:07:36,467 --> 01:07:37,435
LIAM: No, it's heavy.

1773
01:07:37,435 --> 01:07:38,448
LAURA: Let's just keep going.

1774
01:07:38,448 --> 01:07:39,545
MARISHA: It's been there for a while.

1775
01:07:39,545 --> 01:07:40,800
TALIESIN: Let's not give anybody any indication 
we've been here.

1776
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:41,831
LAURA: It's got bat poo on it, let's keep going.

1777
01:07:41,831 --> 01:07:42,920
SAM: Okay.

1778
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:47,092
MATT: As you guys press forward, about another 20 or so

1779
01:07:47,092 --> 01:07:52,597
minutes, you now have a much better view 
of the left side of Emberhold proper.

1780
01:07:52,597 --> 01:07:55,679
And you can see the large magma fall

1781
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:59,772
that is pouring over the top of the fortress's second story

1782
01:07:59,772 --> 01:08:01,329
and completely encompasses that side.

1783
01:08:01,329 --> 01:08:04,358
It splits and divides towards the center -

1784
01:08:04,358 --> 01:08:06,858
a larger fall towards the front of the fortress

1785
01:08:06,858 --> 01:08:08,645
and a thinner one towards the very back.

1786
01:08:08,645 --> 01:08:10,304
LAURA: (whispering) Thin one! Thin one!

1787
01:08:10,304 --> 01:08:11,674
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go towards the door.

1788
01:08:11,674 --> 01:08:12,866
LIAM: All right, creeping back.

1789
01:08:12,866 --> 01:08:14,137
LAURA: Yeah! Creepy, creepy, creepy towards the thin one.

1790
01:08:14,137 --> 01:08:15,177
LIAM: The creeps are creeping.

1791
01:08:15,177 --> 01:08:16,143
MATT: Okay.

1792
01:08:16,143 --> 01:08:17,481
LIAM: We're in stealth, still, or...?

1793
01:08:17,481 --> 01:08:18,482
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're all stealthed.

1794
01:08:18,482 --> 01:08:19,290
MATT: For you, it'd be stealth.

1795
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:20,334
Yeah, you guys are all stealthed still.

1796
01:08:20,334 --> 01:08:21,018
LAURA: Okay.

1797
01:08:21,018 --> 01:08:21,635
MARISHA: We're rolling again?

1798
01:08:21,635 --> 01:08:22,289
LIAM: 26.

1799
01:08:22,289 --> 01:08:24,815
LAURA: You don't to need check it again, 
he didn't tell us to.

1800
01:08:24,815 --> 01:08:26,640
LIAM: Oh. Well, I said I wanted to go back and look.

1801
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:27,478
LAURA: Oh.

1802
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:30,164
MATT: So you move ahead of the rest of the group

1803
01:08:30,164 --> 01:08:32,480
and head to the front of this stream.

1804
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:37,857
And you can see the smooth wall with molten rock

1805
01:08:37,857 --> 01:08:39,579
pouring down the side, and you can see where

1806
01:08:39,579 --> 01:08:43,843
portions of the stone have been 
gradually worn and melted

1807
01:08:43,843 --> 01:08:46,376
by just the contact, but then built upon by

1808
01:08:46,376 --> 01:08:51,270
more and more cooled rock. 
This is a very weird clustered

1809
01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:54,486
framing of cooled rock around this fall.

1810
01:08:54,486 --> 01:08:57,842
You see no doorway, as the actual magma is pressing

1811
01:08:57,842 --> 01:09:00,851
directly against the side of the stronghold.

1812
01:09:00,851 --> 01:09:03,171
LIAM: Right, I want to see if I can tell if anything -

1813
01:09:03,171 --> 01:09:07,071
I know this all looks natural, but perhaps 
something is fashioned to look such.

1814
01:09:07,071 --> 01:09:08,621
I want to see if I can figure that out.

1815
01:09:08,621 --> 01:09:11,438
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an investigate check.

1816
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:15,207
LIAM: Uh, lalalala. 18.

1817
01:09:15,207 --> 01:09:19,929
MATT: 18? Best that you can find, looking around,

1818
01:09:21,889 --> 01:09:26,211
you cannot see anything before you, any sort of mechanism,

1819
01:09:26,211 --> 01:09:29,539
any sort of any button, any sort of lever, or additional doorway.

1820
01:09:29,539 --> 01:09:33,791
It's just a solid wall, with the two magma flows.

1821
01:09:33,791 --> 01:09:35,966
LIAM: All right. I double back for the Underdark expert

1822
01:09:35,966 --> 01:09:37,527
and I bring my sister up.

1823
01:09:37,527 --> 01:09:39,297
LAURA: Right, right, right. Can I come up and look and

1824
01:09:39,297 --> 01:09:41,739
see if I can see any tracking?

1825
01:09:41,739 --> 01:09:44,186
If there's any footprints around a certain area around this.

1826
01:09:44,186 --> 01:09:45,890
LIAM: See if you can find a false door or something.

1827
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:46,908
LAURA: Yeah.

1828
01:09:46,908 --> 01:09:48,597
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make an investigate check.

1829
01:09:48,597 --> 01:09:50,684
LIAM: Do it. Do it.

1830
01:09:50,684 --> 01:09:52,121
MARISHA: Wait, I thought it was behind--

1831
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:53,098
LIAM: No!

1832
01:09:53,098 --> 01:09:54,197
LAURA: It's okay, no, no, no! I get an advantage.

1833
01:09:54,197 --> 01:09:54,797
LIAM: It was a 1.

1834
01:09:54,797 --> 01:09:55,555
LAURA: Shush.

1835
01:09:55,555 --> 01:09:56,921
LIAM: All right. That's not a 1.

1836
01:09:56,921 --> 01:09:58,031
MARISHA: (laughs)
LAURA: Is it investigation?

1837
01:09:58,031 --> 01:09:58,843
LIAM: Yes.

1838
01:09:58,843 --> 01:10:00,505
LAURA: 22.

1839
01:10:00,505 --> 01:10:06,573
MATT: Okay. Looking at this, the side of this fortress,

1840
01:10:06,573 --> 01:10:12,554
you can see what amounts to a very, very slight raise

1841
01:10:12,554 --> 01:10:16,674
in the smooth flow of magma. It seems to pour down

1842
01:10:16,674 --> 01:10:20,203
most of the stronghold and then slightly bulge out,

1843
01:10:20,203 --> 01:10:22,274
and then it pools, and you can now have a better,

1844
01:10:22,274 --> 01:10:24,068
closer so you see where it runs off to.

1845
01:10:24,068 --> 01:10:26,212
It continues into a stream following the edge

1846
01:10:26,212 --> 01:10:28,893
of the giant cavern wall that's curving down

1847
01:10:28,893 --> 01:10:33,209
and to the left into a far deeper cavern.

1848
01:10:33,209 --> 01:10:35,970
You can see the entire cavern, almost like a giant U.

1849
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:38,393
It's open, and the entire thing banks around it and goes

1850
01:10:38,393 --> 01:10:41,411
deeper still. You guys have made it to the far back wall.

1851
01:10:41,411 --> 01:10:43,587
LAURA: (gasps, sighs)

1852
01:10:43,587 --> 01:10:47,038
MATT: Ah, the chicken has arrived.

1853
01:10:47,038 --> 01:10:48,485
SAM: (laughs) Metaphorically...

1854
01:10:48,485 --> 01:10:50,246
MATT: Metaphorically, and actually.

1855
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,058
But from what you can see

1856
01:10:52,058 --> 01:10:54,489
there is a slight raise beneath the magma.

1857
01:10:54,489 --> 01:10:56,982
LAURA: Okay. Does it look like it's safe to bring

1858
01:10:56,982 --> 01:11:02,101
everybody up here or does it seem like 
anything's around that could see us?

1859
01:11:02,101 --> 01:11:03,654
Anything looking from above?

1860
01:11:03,654 --> 01:11:06,108
MATT: You glance up and you can see there are two duergar

1861
01:11:06,108 --> 01:11:09,560
perched up on the edge of the first floor, right on the parapet.

1862
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:12,472
You can see there's all this jagged, obsidian stone,

1863
01:11:12,472 --> 01:11:17,173
almost teeth, sticking out of the very top edge of the wall.

1864
01:11:17,173 --> 01:11:19,591
And you see the patrols just walking, keeping an eye out.

1865
01:11:19,591 --> 01:11:22,477
They have crossbows on their arms.

1866
01:11:22,477 --> 01:11:24,830
A couple of others just have javelins at the side.

1867
01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:26,571
And they're just doing slow patrols.

1868
01:11:26,571 --> 01:11:27,927
LAURA: Okay.

1869
01:11:27,927 --> 01:11:30,203
SAM: We need to 007--

1870
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:31,527
LAURA: We're going to have to be super--

1871
01:11:31,527 --> 01:11:32,949
SAM: We're going to have to 007 sniper them out.

1872
01:11:32,949 --> 01:11:33,639
LAURA: Yeah.

1873
01:11:33,639 --> 01:11:35,287
MARISHA: I can handle this, I think.

1874
01:11:35,287 --> 01:11:36,698
LAURA: You can?

1875
01:11:36,698 --> 01:11:39,064
MARISHA: I think I can get us into that trap door.

1876
01:11:39,064 --> 01:11:40,888
SAM: I think you're right.

1877
01:11:40,888 --> 01:11:42,456
LAURA: Do you have something that can 
pull it towards you?

1878
01:11:42,456 --> 01:11:44,191
SAM: No no no, can you redirect the magma flow around

1879
01:11:44,191 --> 01:11:47,910
that bulge with your - can't you, move rocks or--

1880
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:48,943
MARISHA: I can.

1881
01:11:48,943 --> 01:11:51,263
SAM: So you can create a like a little lip for it to go around?

1882
01:11:51,263 --> 01:11:52,490
LAURA: Ooh...

1883
01:11:52,490 --> 01:11:55,259
MARISHA: I was thinking I could either do - 
that's not a bad idea, or I could -

1884
01:11:55,259 --> 01:11:58,049
That's actually not a bad idea.

1885
01:11:58,049 --> 01:12:00,274
(all laugh)

1886
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:02,592
MATT: (singing) That's fucking teamwork.

1887
01:12:02,592 --> 01:12:03,822
(all laugh)

1888
01:12:03,822 --> 01:12:06,030
MARISHA: Or I could, or I was thinking I could cool off

1889
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:09,217
the magma and we could break it.

1890
01:12:09,217 --> 01:12:13,102
LAURA: Oh yeah, maybe you can move 
it away, and then cool it.

1891
01:12:13,102 --> 01:12:14,476
LIAM: That sounds kind of noisy.

1892
01:12:14,476 --> 01:12:15,600
MARISHA: Well...

1893
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,342
SAM: First we’ve got to take care of the guys on the roof.

1894
01:12:17,342 --> 01:12:20,002
Are they back with us, or are they still stealthing in front?

1895
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,028
MATT: They're still stealthing in front, and you guys have

1896
01:12:22,028 --> 01:12:23,335
come back to the group?

1897
01:12:23,335 --> 01:12:24,421
LAURA: Yeah, I guess we came back to the group

1898
01:12:24,421 --> 01:12:26,077
and told them about what's going on.

1899
01:12:26,077 --> 01:12:30,697
SAM: Okay. We can - me and Pike - can take out 
the guys on the roof.

1900
01:12:30,697 --> 01:12:31,863
LAURA: Oh really?

1901
01:12:31,863 --> 01:12:33,228
TRAVIS: Yeah! Do it!
ASHLEY: You want to give it a go?

1902
01:12:33,228 --> 01:12:34,301
LAURA: Wait, but he's got sneak attack.

1903
01:12:34,301 --> 01:12:36,404
LIAM: Yeah, I'm thinking that Keyleth should--

1904
01:12:36,404 --> 01:12:37,805
LAURA: Yeah but we could--

1905
01:12:37,805 --> 01:12:38,809
SAM: Yeah, but they're a good 200 feet up.

1906
01:12:38,809 --> 01:12:39,729
LIAM: --bird out and drop me.

1907
01:12:39,729 --> 01:12:41,588
LAURA: If Keyleth can bird up or you could go over 
on the flying carpet or something.

1908
01:12:41,588 --> 01:12:43,249
SAM: I can take Pike and we can do it.

1909
01:12:43,249 --> 01:12:44,544
LAURA: Oh my god.

1910
01:12:44,544 --> 01:12:45,692
(all laugh)

1911
01:12:45,692 --> 01:12:46,894
MARISHA: Are they are they unable to be shot out?

1912
01:12:46,894 --> 01:12:48,000
Can you not arrow them out?

1913
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,314
LAURA: I can try to arrow them out too.

1914
01:12:49,314 --> 01:12:50,363
MARISHA: How high are they?

1915
01:12:50,363 --> 01:12:52,276
LIAM: She can get a hit or two, but 
the chances that she

1916
01:12:52,276 --> 01:12:54,224
could take them both out at once...

1917
01:12:54,224 --> 01:12:56,782
LAURA: Maybe you should go up and I'll 
arrow one and you...

1918
01:12:56,782 --> 01:12:58,778
TRAVIS: Why don't you let the little 
people have some fun?

1919
01:12:58,778 --> 01:13:00,817
MARISHA: I'm just afraid if you go up there, that you're 
going to alarm yourself to other people.

1920
01:13:00,817 --> 01:13:05,613
TALIESIN: How loud is it down there? 
Is the lava flow making noise?

1921
01:13:05,613 --> 01:13:08,923
MATT: Very subtle pops and hisses, but other 
than that it's pretty quiet.

1922
01:13:08,923 --> 01:13:11,016
TALIESIN: Not like the roaring sound of a waterfall.

1923
01:13:11,016 --> 01:13:14,147
MATT: No, no, it's a slow gradual pour.

1924
01:13:14,898 --> 01:13:17,839
TALIESIN: Does anybody have a "mute" spell
of some kind?

1925
01:13:17,839 --> 01:13:20,859
SAM: Mute, as in silence noise, or a person?

1926
01:13:20,859 --> 01:13:22,549
LAURA: I mean, Pass Without Trace, there's silence?

1927
01:13:22,549 --> 01:13:23,666
TALIESIN: Yes, as in silence noise.

1928
01:13:23,666 --> 01:13:24,790
ASHLEY: Wait!

1929
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:25,951
SAM: No, not me.

1930
01:13:25,951 --> 01:13:26,909
TALIESIN: Damn it.

1931
01:13:26,909 --> 01:13:27,629
ASHLEY: I have - okay wait.

1932
01:13:27,629 --> 01:13:29,868
MATT: David Norris? Thank you David Norris 
for the chicken!

1933
01:13:29,868 --> 01:13:31,066
ALL: Thank you David Norris!

1934
01:13:31,066 --> 01:13:31,827
LAURA: The chicken is delicious!

1935
01:13:31,827 --> 01:13:32,677
ORION: I love chicken.

1936
01:13:32,677 --> 01:13:33,885
LIAM: Dave, the illithids have it. Thank you, Dave.

1937
01:13:33,885 --> 01:13:39,393
LAURA: I'm just not going to let you see me eat it.

1938
01:13:39,393 --> 01:13:42,318
LIAM: Oh my god, her mouth opens up and 
tentacles come out and -

1939
01:13:42,318 --> 01:13:44,317
ORION: It's really scary.

1940
01:13:47,911 --> 01:13:49,407
MARISHA: Sorry, what are we doing?

1941
01:13:49,407 --> 01:13:52,223
MATT: It's a good question. What are you doing?

1942
01:13:52,223 --> 01:13:54,221
SAM: We gotta take out the fuckers on the roof.

1943
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:55,232
LAURA: Right.

1944
01:13:55,232 --> 01:13:56,855
SAM: Do you want to try to shoot them out?

1945
01:13:56,855 --> 01:13:59,181
Or do you want me to take Pike and fuck their shit up?

1946
01:13:59,181 --> 01:14:00,176
TRAVIS: Do that.

1947
01:14:00,176 --> 01:14:01,359
LAURA: I mean, if you can flip them off the roof

1948
01:14:01,359 --> 01:14:02,391
that would be awesome.

1949
01:14:02,391 --> 01:14:04,365
SAM: That's what we're going to do.
LAURA: Okay, then do it.

1950
01:14:04,365 --> 01:14:06,581
LIAM: Wait, can we see anyone else?
ASHLEY: We're just going to fling them off of the roof?

1951
01:14:06,581 --> 01:14:07,830
LIAM: Can I see duergar from any other perch?

1952
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:08,817
TRAVIS: Yep, pressure's on!

1953
01:14:08,817 --> 01:14:10,599
MATT: From your current position, you're up 
against the wall, no.

1954
01:14:10,599 --> 01:14:12,129
LIAM: No? All right.

1955
01:14:12,129 --> 01:14:14,214
MATT: You can back away and take up 
more of a case on it if you want.

1956
01:14:14,214 --> 01:14:15,794
MARISHA: I mean if I took eagle form I could drop you

1957
01:14:15,794 --> 01:14:18,229
and then I could just pick one up with my eagle talons 
and in the lava they go.

1958
01:14:18,229 --> 01:14:20,655
LIAM: This seems dangerous and reckless.

1959
01:14:20,655 --> 01:14:22,737
MARISHA: It does seem very dangerous and reckless.

1960
01:14:22,737 --> 01:14:24,106
LIAM: Let's do it?

1961
01:14:24,106 --> 01:14:25,270
ASHLEY: What if it brings attention?

1962
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:26,738
LIAM: Who gives a shit?

1963
01:14:26,738 --> 01:14:28,237
MARISHA: I'm keeping my Pass Without A Trace up.

1964
01:14:28,237 --> 01:14:29,913
LAURA: We'll just have to be fast. Be really speedy.

1965
01:14:29,913 --> 01:14:31,980
ORION: Can they see down to where we are? 
Does it just keep going?

1966
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:33,292
MARISHA: I'm going with you guys.

1967
01:14:33,292 --> 01:14:35,315
TRAVIS: It's been over an hour, we've 
killed nothing, we'll kill these fucks!

1968
01:14:35,315 --> 01:14:37,107
MATT: So far only the two of them have really 
approached the stronghold and you guys

1969
01:14:37,107 --> 01:14:38,904
have stayed back behind the elevations.

1970
01:14:38,904 --> 01:14:40,701
TRAVIS: I'm a vampire. I need blood.

1971
01:14:40,701 --> 01:14:42,703
MATT: So you can all try, in theory, if you want 
to just stealth past them.

1972
01:14:42,703 --> 01:14:44,043
MARISHA: Wait, what?

1973
01:14:44,043 --> 01:14:44,978
SAM: Here's my plan.

1974
01:14:44,978 --> 01:14:45,823
LAURA: Okay!

1975
01:14:45,823 --> 01:14:46,834
ORION: We're not with them.

1976
01:14:46,834 --> 01:14:48,029
MARISHA: Yeah we are, we are.

1977
01:14:48,029 --> 01:14:50,074
SAM: I take Pike up there. We knock those 
fuckers off, super easy.

1978
01:14:50,074 --> 01:14:50,820
TRAVIS: Yep.

1979
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:53,030
SAM: Grog runs out and brains them the second 
they hit the ground.

1980
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,758
TRAVIS: I approve of this plan.

1981
01:14:54,758 --> 01:14:56,440
LIAM: Or fall in the lava. You just gotta shove them.

1982
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:57,894
LAURA: Yeah, they'll fall in the lava pit, 
just shove them off the side.

1983
01:14:57,894 --> 01:14:59,171
SAM: Maybe. I don't know where they're going to fall.

1984
01:14:59,171 --> 01:15:00,481
LAURA: Well, just do it.

1985
01:15:00,481 --> 01:15:02,544
MARISHA: Well, if they miss they miss 
the lava pit, we've got Grog.

1986
01:15:02,544 --> 01:15:04,222
ORION: Can I just say right now--

1987
01:15:04,222 --> 01:15:06,270
LAURA: Just be ready to let us know if you need help.

1988
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:08,421
ORION: --I'm going to be reading this book.

1989
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:09,925
MARISHA: Eagle form.

1990
01:15:09,925 --> 01:15:13,512
LIAM: I'm hanging by Keyleth in case shit goes south.
LAURA: Oh my god this is so stupid.

1991
01:15:13,512 --> 01:15:14,773
LIAM: Then we're going up, right?

1992
01:15:14,773 --> 01:15:15,971
MARISHA: Jump on my back.

1993
01:15:15,971 --> 01:15:17,055
SAM: What you got, Pike?

1994
01:15:17,055 --> 01:15:18,059
LIAM: Yeah, girl.

1995
01:15:18,059 --> 01:15:19,310
LAURA: Give me the flying carpet just in case 
I need to fly.

1996
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:20,314
MARISHA: Or I can give you a ride.

1997
01:15:20,314 --> 01:15:21,866
SAM: I can get you up there. What can you do 
when we're up there?

1998
01:15:21,866 --> 01:15:23,272
ASHLEY: There's something I've been wanting to do.

1999
01:15:23,272 --> 01:15:24,060
SAM: Yeah!

2000
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:25,145
TRAVIS: What do you say?

2001
01:15:25,145 --> 01:15:26,121
ORION: Oh my word, this is fascinating!

2002
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:27,145
LAURA: We're doing it!

2003
01:15:27,145 --> 01:15:28,388
TRAVIS: But what do you say to get the magic carpet?

2004
01:15:28,388 --> 01:15:30,440
LAURA: Please can I have the magic carpet?

2005
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:34,745
SAM: I'm going to just look at the guard's 
pattern of movement.

2006
01:15:34,745 --> 01:15:38,062
Are they staying in position, or are they walking around?

2007
01:15:38,062 --> 01:15:39,982
Are they talking to each other at all?

2008
01:15:39,982 --> 01:15:41,212
TRAVIS: Ooh, good question.

2009
01:15:41,212 --> 01:15:44,284
MATT: As you watch, you take a moment, still from 
the far back position,

2010
01:15:44,284 --> 01:15:48,535
watch the two up there come together; 
they chat for a second,

2011
01:15:48,535 --> 01:15:50,219
then a third one appears.

2012
01:15:50,219 --> 01:15:51,143
SAM: Oh shit.

2013
01:15:51,143 --> 01:15:52,682
MATT: Then one of them rotates out

2014
01:15:52,682 --> 01:15:53,991
for the one that just arrived.

2015
01:15:53,991 --> 01:15:55,264
ASHLEY: They were switching shifts.

2016
01:15:55,264 --> 01:15:56,566
MATT: They both just sit there, keeping an eye.

2017
01:15:56,566 --> 01:15:57,374
One of them cleans his bow.

2018
01:15:57,374 --> 01:15:58,404
SAM: Are they close to each other?

2019
01:15:58,404 --> 01:15:59,795
MATT: They're about twenty feet from each other

2020
01:15:59,795 --> 01:16:01,295
along the top of the parapet.

2021
01:16:01,295 --> 01:16:02,940
TRAVIS: There's three? There's three, not two?

2022
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:04,001
SAM: You said twenty feet?

2023
01:16:04,001 --> 01:16:04,725
MATT: Twenty feet, yes.

2024
01:16:04,725 --> 01:16:06,183
TRAVIS: There's three up there?

2025
01:16:06,183 --> 01:16:07,250
TALIESIN: Now there's three.

2026
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:08,127
MATT: Two.

2027
01:16:08,127 --> 01:16:09,820
SAM: No no, one came to swap out the other.

2028
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:11,436
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

2029
01:16:11,436 --> 01:16:13,042
TRAVIS: I’m just saying, I have been known to climb

2030
01:16:13,042 --> 01:16:16,248
a few things in my time, if you need an extra.

2031
01:16:16,248 --> 01:16:18,801
ASHLEY: All right, let's do it.

2032
01:16:18,801 --> 01:16:20,842
MARISHA: Are you coming too, Pike?

2033
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:26,549
ASHLEY: Yeah! I'm a-coming up there 
to kill some - some things.

2034
01:16:26,549 --> 01:16:29,359
(all laugh)

2035
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:31,001
TRAVIS: Do you have any climbing gear or anything?

2036
01:16:31,001 --> 01:16:34,506
ASHLEY: I have a grappling hook.

2037
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:35,886
LIAM: The ocean has changed you.

2038
01:16:35,886 --> 01:16:37,413
LAURA: Oh my god. This is stupid.

2039
01:16:37,413 --> 01:16:40,288
SAM: Okay, they're standing twenty feet apart?

2040
01:16:40,288 --> 01:16:41,397
MATT: Yeah.

2041
01:16:41,397 --> 01:16:43,018
TALIESIN: I'm going to watch this all 
go down with Bad News.

2042
01:16:43,018 --> 01:16:44,198
SAM: Radius? 15 feet?

2043
01:16:44,198 --> 01:16:45,239
LAURA: Yeah, me and you get ready to shoot.

2044
01:16:45,239 --> 01:16:46,922
TALIESIN: I'm waiting in case--

2045
01:16:46,922 --> 01:16:48,274
SAM: Is the range a radius?

2046
01:16:48,274 --> 01:16:49,714
MARISHA: So wait, who's all going?

2047
01:16:49,714 --> 01:16:50,613
TRAVIS: Just those two.

2048
01:16:50,613 --> 01:16:51,675
MATT: No, range is how far away from you they are,

2049
01:16:51,675 --> 01:16:52,692
and the radius is for the point of the spell.

2050
01:16:52,692 --> 01:16:54,171
SAM: No, I mean a range of a spell, is how far from me?

2051
01:16:54,171 --> 01:16:55,477
MARISHA: Just those two?
TRAVIS: Scanlan and Pike.

2052
01:16:55,477 --> 01:16:56,496
LAURA: And you're going to bring them up if you can.

2053
01:16:56,496 --> 01:16:57,249
MATT: Yes.

2054
01:16:57,249 --> 01:16:58,383
SAM: Got it. We're good.

2055
01:16:58,383 --> 01:16:59,539
LIAM: Are they carpeting up? How are you going up?

2056
01:16:59,539 --> 01:17:00,301
MARISHA: Are you guys going to fly on me?

2057
01:17:00,301 --> 01:17:01,538
LAURA: They'll fly on Keyleth.

2058
01:17:01,538 --> 01:17:02,966
LIAM: Scanlan, how are you guys going up? 
Eagle? Carpet?

2059
01:17:02,966 --> 01:17:04,424
SAM: No.

2060
01:17:04,424 --> 01:17:05,323
LAURA: Eagle.

2061
01:17:05,323 --> 01:17:06,187
LIAM: What?

2062
01:17:06,187 --> 01:17:07,278
TRAVIS: You're climbing that shit, aren't you?

2063
01:17:07,278 --> 01:17:08,722
SAM: I can get there like that. We're good.

2064
01:17:08,722 --> 01:17:09,616
TRAVIS: Cliffhanger. Beautiful.

2065
01:17:09,616 --> 01:17:10,551
LIAM: Do it, Tom Cruise.

2066
01:17:10,551 --> 01:17:11,909
LAURA: All right, do it. Mission Impossible.

2067
01:17:11,909 --> 01:17:13,809
SAM: All right. You ready? Do you know what you're 
going to do up there?

2068
01:17:13,809 --> 01:17:16,041
ASHLEY: Not really, but let's just wing it!

2069
01:17:16,041 --> 01:17:18,815
SAM: I'm going to try to knock them 
both off in one blow,

2070
01:17:18,815 --> 01:17:21,055
but if I miss, you gotta take one.

2071
01:17:21,055 --> 01:17:22,117
LAURA: You can charge them off if you want.

2072
01:17:22,117 --> 01:17:23,365
ASHLEY: Okay. all right. I can take one 
if you can take one.

2073
01:17:23,365 --> 01:17:24,327
TRAVIS: You’ve got a morningstar.

2074
01:17:24,327 --> 01:17:25,089
SAM: Okay.

2075
01:17:25,089 --> 01:17:26,057
ASHLEY: All right.

2076
01:17:26,057 --> 01:17:26,848
TRAVIS: Morningstar to the taint.

2077
01:17:26,848 --> 01:17:27,642
SAM: Grog, you ready to kill?

2078
01:17:27,642 --> 01:17:28,386
TRAVIS: Yeah, oh yeah!

2079
01:17:28,386 --> 01:17:30,284
LAURA: Be really quiet while you're fighting, 
try to take them out before they--

2080
01:17:30,284 --> 01:17:31,374
TALIESIN: This is awesome and nothing 
is going to go wrong.

2081
01:17:31,374 --> 01:17:32,928
MARISHA: Why are we using the gnomes 
to throw people over?

2082
01:17:32,928 --> 01:17:34,358
ORION: I can't believe how they wrote this.

2083
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:35,786
SAM: We’re little people! You know why?

2084
01:17:35,786 --> 01:17:38,053
Because I need someone with me 
and I can only take her,

2085
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:42,429
because that's the only other one who will fit 
through the Dimension Door with me.

2086
01:17:42,429 --> 01:17:43,664
LAURA: Go!

2087
01:17:43,664 --> 01:17:44,645
ASHLEY: The Dimension Door?

2088
01:17:44,645 --> 01:17:46,362
SAM: Yes, we're going to go through a Dimension Door.

2089
01:17:46,362 --> 01:17:49,030
I can take one person of my height or smaller.

2090
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:50,160
MATT: All right.

2091
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,157
SAM: So I will take Pike.

2092
01:17:51,157 --> 01:17:52,167
LIAM: Portal, motherfucker!

2093
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:55,183
MATT: You reach over and hold on to Pike gently, 
give her a little wink. And suddenly--

2094
01:17:55,183 --> 01:17:57,798
SAM: We're going to try to appear between the two of them.

2095
01:17:57,798 --> 01:18:00,443
Exactly between the two of them.

2096
01:18:00,443 --> 01:18:05,475
MATT: Okay. You feel the sudden rush of air and 
the surrounding atmosphere of you goes from

2097
01:18:05,475 --> 01:18:09,664
that uncomfortable warmth to a sudden freezing cold 
as your vision goes black and all you can see

2098
01:18:09,664 --> 01:18:14,556
is Scanlan looking at you with this heightened grin 
as he's muttering these arcane incantations under his breath.

2099
01:18:14,556 --> 01:18:18,953
An instant later, you guys are both standing at the top 
of the wall, with both of the duergar,

2100
01:18:18,953 --> 01:18:23,819
one kind of facing away, one looking really surprised 
at the fact that you guys both appeared there.

2101
01:18:23,819 --> 01:18:25,344
You have a surprise round. What are you doing?

2102
01:18:25,344 --> 01:18:28,180
SAM: I cast Thunderwave and blast out from where

2103
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:31,558
I'm standing between them, 15 feet in either direction.

2104
01:18:31,558 --> 01:18:32,823
LAURA: (whispering) That's so loud!

2105
01:18:32,823 --> 01:18:33,744
MARISHA: Isn't that loud?

2106
01:18:33,744 --> 01:18:35,165
SAM: So, 10 feet and 10 feet away from me.

2107
01:18:35,165 --> 01:18:36,770
MATT: Okay. What's your save?

2108
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:38,548
SAM: Uh, 19.

2109
01:18:38,548 --> 01:18:39,796
LIAM: But a quiet Thunderwave, right?

2110
01:18:39,796 --> 01:18:40,728
MATT: 19, all right.

2111
01:18:40,728 --> 01:18:41,685
LAURA: A really quiet Thunderwave.

2112
01:18:41,685 --> 01:18:42,957
ORION: Thunderclap is loud. Thunderwave is different.

2113
01:18:42,957 --> 01:18:44,287
LAURA: Oh, okay.

2114
01:18:44,287 --> 01:18:47,900
MARISHA: But I'm pretty sure it's still thunder.

2115
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:51,625
MATT: Thunderwave, looking it up real fast just to 
make sure of the situation.

2116
01:18:51,625 --> 01:18:52,746
TRAVIS: I like this plan.

2117
01:18:52,746 --> 01:18:54,106
ORION: Thunder makes a noise right?

2118
01:18:54,106 --> 01:18:55,514
LIAM: (singing) This is a triumph.

2119
01:18:55,514 --> 01:18:56,910
ASHLEY: (singing) I'm making a note here.

2120
01:18:56,910 --> 01:18:58,431
SEVERAL: (singing) Huge success.

2121
01:18:58,431 --> 01:18:59,844
(all laugh)

2122
01:18:59,844 --> 01:19:01,079
MATT: Here we go.

2123
01:19:01,079 --> 01:19:02,276
SAM: I don't think it's loud.

2124
01:19:02,276 --> 01:19:04,062
LIAM: We're total fake geeks, all of us.

2125
01:19:04,062 --> 01:19:05,085
(all laugh)

2126
01:19:05,085 --> 01:19:06,288
TALIESIN: Such fake geeks.

2127
01:19:06,288 --> 01:19:09,744
SAM: Oh no - well, it's a wave of thunderous force,

2128
01:19:09,744 --> 01:19:12,435
but it doesn't say sound.
It just says thunderous force.

2129
01:19:12,435 --> 01:19:15,661
MATT: I would say thunderous force isn't 
a thunderclap,but it will make some noise.

2130
01:19:15,661 --> 01:19:16,475
SAM: Okay, fine.

2131
01:19:16,475 --> 01:19:17,744
MATT: So keep that in mind.

2132
01:19:17,744 --> 01:19:19,585
LAURA: Keyleth, fly up and cast Pass Without Trace 
on them.

2133
01:19:19,585 --> 01:19:22,639
MATT: So, as you guys appear, you release Pike, 
you bring your arms up and slam your arms

2134
01:19:22,639 --> 01:19:28,730
in a downward motion. As you do, there is 
a dull flash of light and a (boom noise)

2135
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:30,715
burst sound emanates from you.

2136
01:19:30,715 --> 01:19:31,966
ORION: I say, “Ooh, light.”

2137
01:19:31,966 --> 01:19:34,673
MATT: Both of the duergar, the one who sees you,

2138
01:19:34,673 --> 01:19:36,346
who is bringing us his crossbow to fire,

2139
01:19:36,346 --> 01:19:39,469
gets impacted and blown off the side of the wall.

2140
01:19:39,469 --> 01:19:42,106
The one facing away gets blown up towards,

2141
01:19:42,106 --> 01:19:44,559
slams into the side of the wall, right at the edge,

2142
01:19:44,559 --> 01:19:47,594
and then topples over the side, both plummeting over.

2143
01:19:47,594 --> 01:19:49,138
LIAM: Wilhelm scream!

2144
01:19:49,138 --> 01:19:50,609
ASHLEY: Oh!

2145
01:19:50,609 --> 01:19:52,463
MATT: Brief Wilhelm scream. You're standing there, 
you watch this happen.

2146
01:19:52,463 --> 01:19:54,246
ASHLEY: I didn't have to do anything, Scanlan!

2147
01:19:54,246 --> 01:19:55,596
SAM: Make out with me!

2148
01:19:55,596 --> 01:19:57,617
(all laugh)

2149
01:19:57,617 --> 01:20:01,228
SAM: We’re alone, it’s super romantic. 
I just killed two fuckers!

2150
01:20:01,228 --> 01:20:03,874
Come on! It’s now or never, baby!

2151
01:20:03,874 --> 01:20:05,072
TRAVIS: (singing) I think we’re alone now!

2152
01:20:05,072 --> 01:20:07,041
ASHLEY &amp; TRAVIS: (singing) Doesn’t seem to be anyone around!

2153
01:20:07,041 --> 01:20:08,874
(all laugh)

2154
01:20:08,874 --> 01:20:10,841
ASHLEY: Well, let’s just wait until we’re out of danger.

2155
01:20:10,841 --> 01:20:12,532
MARISHA: Yeah, it’s getting real romantic real quick, Scanlan.

2156
01:20:12,532 --> 01:20:13,606
SAM: Wait? 
ASHLEY: But that was really hot!

2157
01:20:13,606 --> 01:20:14,663
SAM: It was really hot, right? Come on!
ASHLEY: It was.

2158
01:20:14,663 --> 01:20:16,163
SAM: Just a little something something?

2159
01:20:16,163 --> 01:20:17,036
ASHLEY: Let’s just--

2160
01:20:17,036 --> 01:20:17,927
MARISHA: So sexy.

2161
01:20:17,927 --> 01:20:21,714
MATT: As this is happening, both of the duergar come 
plummeting off the side of the wall.

2162
01:20:21,714 --> 01:20:22,966
LIAM: Friendzoned.

2163
01:20:22,966 --> 01:20:28,936
MATT: One manages to kind of loosely break his fall 
but the full 25 foot fall - he takes--

2164
01:20:28,936 --> 01:20:30,109
LAURA: Get ready.

2165
01:20:30,109 --> 01:20:31,057
LIAM: Come on, Grog.

2166
01:20:31,057 --> 01:20:32,016
TRAVIS: I rage!

2167
01:20:32,016 --> 01:20:33,143
(all laugh)

2168
01:20:33,143 --> 01:20:38,823
MATT: There’s one that lands just to the side of the 
magma pool that’s forming.

2169
01:20:38,823 --> 01:20:43,442
He took some damage and is like (pained gasps) 
trying to get back up. He fell hard on one arm.

2170
01:20:43,442 --> 01:20:48,316
The other one that’s further away from the magma, 
the one that saw you, managed to reduce his damage

2171
01:20:48,316 --> 01:20:50,626
a little bit because it was aware at least you were there.

2172
01:20:50,626 --> 01:20:51,981
SAM: We have to kill these fuckers.

2173
01:20:51,981 --> 01:20:54,791
MATT: Looks like it took some damage, but not too much. 
It’s maybe 10 feet from you.

2174
01:20:54,791 --> 01:20:57,097
TRAVIS: (eager laugh)

2175
01:20:57,097 --> 01:21:01,311
MATT: As he’s trying to get back up, he looks up and sees you
charging towards him, Grog, raging.

2176
01:21:01,311 --> 01:21:02,739
Go ahead and make your two attacks.

2177
01:21:02,739 --> 01:21:03,617
LAURA: Yes!

2178
01:21:03,617 --> 01:21:08,677
TRAVIS: (roars) 19.

2179
01:21:08,677 --> 01:21:10,370
MATT: 19 hits.

2180
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:12,418
TRAVIS: Nice. And 19 again!

2181
01:21:12,418 --> 01:21:13,994
MATT: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

2182
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:16,613
LIAM: I’m going to get some duergar!

2183
01:21:18,743 --> 01:21:22,387
TRAVIS: 17 and 19.

2184
01:21:22,387 --> 01:21:25,144
MATT: So as he gets up, (grunt) he goes back for 
his warhammer.

2185
01:21:25,144 --> 01:21:27,652
Before he gets a chance to, you cleave off one arm

2186
01:21:27,652 --> 01:21:30,555
and send the axe right into the center of his torso,

2187
01:21:30,555 --> 01:21:32,087
silencing him in an instant.

2188
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:34,997
He slightly spreads at the wound. (choking sound)

2189
01:21:34,997 --> 01:21:37,738
This gurgling sound, and you just have to kick him 
off the edge of your axe.

2190
01:21:37,738 --> 01:21:40,927
TRAVIS: I tilt him towards the pillar to spray 
the pillar with his gore.

2191
01:21:40,927 --> 01:21:42,896
Look, I can make one too! Ha ha!

2192
01:21:42,896 --> 01:21:44,498
(all laugh)

2193
01:21:44,498 --> 01:21:49,583
MARISHA: I run across to the other one and Thorn Whip 
him from across the lava pool.

2194
01:21:49,583 --> 01:21:53,219
MATT: You have to jump over the lava to do that because 
he’s on the side you guys are on.

2195
01:21:53,219 --> 01:21:55,904
MARISHA: Oh. Well then, is there anyone on the other side?

2196
01:21:55,904 --> 01:21:57,782
ASHLEY: Is he already dying, or no? He’s in the lava?

2197
01:21:57,782 --> 01:21:58,923
MARISHA: He’s on the same side as me?

2198
01:21:58,923 --> 01:22:00,379
MATT: He’s on the same side as you.
SAM: He’s hurt.

2199
01:22:00,379 --> 01:22:02,001
LAURA: We run up and kick him into the lava!
MARISHA: Is he standing up or...yeah!

2200
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:03,766
MATT: He’s in the process of standing up, yeah.
LAURA: Can we just run up and kick him into the lava?

2201
01:22:03,766 --> 01:22:05,446
MARISHA: Yeah, can I just run and push?

2202
01:22:05,446 --> 01:22:07,363
MATT: (laughs) Okay, all right, so…

2203
01:22:07,363 --> 01:22:08,835
LIAM: I use pushing attack!

2204
01:22:08,835 --> 01:22:10,250
TRAVIS: (grunts) Hunh!
MARISHA: (grunts) Hunh!

2205
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:11,547
SAM: (high voice) I’m sorry!

2206
01:22:11,547 --> 01:22:12,691
MARISHA: (laughing) Yes, exactly!

2207
01:22:12,691 --> 01:22:13,589
(all laugh)

2208
01:22:13,589 --> 01:22:14,886
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll athletics.

2209
01:22:14,886 --> 01:22:16,103
MARISHA: This is the meanest thing I’ve ever done!

2210
01:22:16,103 --> 01:22:17,248
LIAM &amp; MATT: (laugh)

2211
01:22:17,248 --> 01:22:19,128
LAURA: No, no, remember you killed that kid one time.

2212
01:22:19,128 --> 01:22:21,491
MARISHA: Oh, thanks for bringing that up, Vax!

2213
01:22:21,491 --> 01:22:22,532
(all laugh)

2214
01:22:22,532 --> 01:22:23,941
LAURA: I’m Vex, he’s Vax!

2215
01:22:23,941 --> 01:22:25,505
TRAVIS: That’s some dark shit! That’s some dark shit!

2216
01:22:25,505 --> 01:22:27,826
MARISHA: Oh, I thought it was Vex and Vax. 
Every time I get confused.

2217
01:22:27,826 --> 01:22:29,409
MATT: (laughing) It’s a long story!

2218
01:22:29,409 --> 01:22:30,686
ASHLEY: Oh my god. Remember you killed 
that kid one time?

2219
01:22:30,686 --> 01:22:33,103
LIAM: Two and a half years in and Keyleth 
has just learned our names.

2220
01:22:33,103 --> 01:22:35,091
MARISHA: I get them confused.

2221
01:22:35,091 --> 01:22:36,588
SAM: I do too. All the time.

2222
01:22:36,588 --> 01:22:37,677
SEVERAL: All the time.

2223
01:22:37,677 --> 01:22:38,846
MARISHA: See, no one else has any idea!

2224
01:22:38,846 --> 01:22:39,891
ORION: I have your names written down!

2225
01:22:39,891 --> 01:22:41,895
LIAM: I’m Vex, okay? It’s simple!

2226
01:22:41,895 --> 01:22:43,086
SAM: No, no! That is not true!

2227
01:22:43,086 --> 01:22:44,419
LAURA: No, no, don’t do that. He’s lying.

2228
01:22:44,419 --> 01:22:46,218
MARISHA: (laughing) Two years, and I just don’t.

2229
01:22:46,218 --> 01:22:49,610
MATT: So, as the terrible blood spray occurs across the

2230
01:22:49,610 --> 01:22:52,276
nearby pillar on Grog’s side, the other duergar is getting up

2231
01:22:52,276 --> 01:22:57,120
with his crossbow, trying to get it ready. 
You rush forward.

2232
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:58,628
Go ahead and roll athletics.

2233
01:22:58,628 --> 01:22:59,906
MARISHA: Oh!

2234
01:22:59,906 --> 01:23:00,746
ASHLEY: Come on!

2235
01:23:00,746 --> 01:23:01,755
LAURA: Oh no!

2236
01:23:01,755 --> 01:23:03,608
ORION: As she does this, I notice 
everything, and I sit down.

2237
01:23:03,608 --> 01:23:05,197
MARISHA: This is for that kid!

2238
01:23:05,197 --> 01:23:06,253
ORION: And turn to the next chapter in my book.

2239
01:23:06,253 --> 01:23:07,068
MATT: Okay.

2240
01:23:07,068 --> 01:23:08,486
LIAM: (singing) He had it coming, he had it coming.

2241
01:23:08,486 --> 01:23:10,512
ASHLEY: This is quite a good read!

2242
01:23:10,512 --> 01:23:12,891
MARISHA: It could be worse. 14.

2243
01:23:12,891 --> 01:23:15,051
MATT: That’s okay. He rolled a 1.

2244
01:23:15,051 --> 01:23:17,152
LAURA: Ooh! Yes!

2245
01:23:17,152 --> 01:23:18,649
MATT: So, as the duergar is getting up, he goes - (grunt)

2246
01:23:18,649 --> 01:23:19,850
You just run up and - boom!

2247
01:23:19,850 --> 01:23:23,034
And he falls back - (hissing SFX) (screams)

2248
01:23:23,034 --> 01:23:29,375
- and starts giving a horrible, painful scream as he’s 
essentially flailing in the magma, melting.

2249
01:23:29,375 --> 01:23:30,680
ASHLEY: Someone shoot him in the mouth.

2250
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:38,974
MARISHA: I say, shh! Shh! Shh! And I wind down 
to push him under the lava!

2251
01:23:38,974 --> 01:23:41,147
ASHLEY: Oh, this is brutal!

2252
01:23:41,147 --> 01:23:42,651
ORION: That’s not what it’s called.

2253
01:23:42,651 --> 01:23:45,745
MATT: Okay. So, as he’s screaming your Wind Wall shoves 
him further under the magma as he’s screaming,

2254
01:23:45,745 --> 01:23:49,219
cooling the magma around him as the rock (cracking SFX) 
cracks around him, turning into black rock--

2255
01:23:49,219 --> 01:23:50,489
MARISHA: I’m sorry! I’m sorry!

2256
01:23:50,489 --> 01:23:53,921
MATT: --his face still visible over the surface, 
going (choking SFX)

2257
01:23:53,921 --> 01:23:57,408
in this horrible, almost Han-in-carbonite type of look 
at the top of the magma pool.

2258
01:23:57,408 --> 01:23:58,449
LAURA: Keyleth!

2259
01:23:58,449 --> 01:24:00,012
LIAM: You just one-upped Grog, man.

2260
01:24:00,012 --> 01:24:01,527
TRAVIS: That was awesome!

2261
01:24:01,527 --> 01:24:06,519
MATT: As fresh magma now begins to pool over the cool, 
covering his face, you step away.

2262
01:24:06,519 --> 01:24:08,012
SAM: Piss on the body!

2263
01:24:08,012 --> 01:24:10,136
TRAVIS: I never knew you were an artist.

2264
01:24:10,136 --> 01:24:12,196
MARISHA: (laughs nervously)

2265
01:24:12,196 --> 01:24:16,717
MATT: However, the subtle sound of the Thunderwave 
and then the horrible screams of pain,

2266
01:24:16,717 --> 01:24:20,146
you can hear footsteps coming toward the wall edge 
where both you and Pike are currently on.

2267
01:24:20,146 --> 01:24:21,335
What are you going to do?

2268
01:24:21,335 --> 01:24:22,650
LAURA: Run! Or can you turn yourselves into duergar?

2269
01:24:22,650 --> 01:24:23,618
SAM: Is there a door or something?

2270
01:24:23,618 --> 01:24:24,922
MATT: Not from your current position, no.

2271
01:24:24,922 --> 01:24:29,594
You’re just on a five foot ledge of the second story.

2272
01:24:29,594 --> 01:24:33,480
SAM: Of the fortress. Oh, it’s not a standalone 
tower. It’s part of a larger wall.

2273
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:36,160
ASHLEY: How far of a jump down is it?

2274
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:37,699
MATT: It’s about 25 feet.

2275
01:24:37,699 --> 01:24:39,372
LAURA: What, am I too excited about it?

2276
01:24:39,372 --> 01:24:41,873
Turn yourself into a duergar! Make it seem 
like everything’s okay!

2277
01:24:41,873 --> 01:24:43,243
ASHLEY: Should we call Grog?

2278
01:24:43,243 --> 01:24:44,310
SAM: No, I’ll do the same thing to get us down.

2279
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:45,158
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, Dimension Door!

2280
01:24:45,158 --> 01:24:46,080
SAM: Unless you want to stay and fight.

2281
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:46,887
MATT: You’ve got 20 seconds.

2282
01:24:46,887 --> 01:24:47,882
MARISHA: Wait, what’s happening?

2283
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:48,998
ASHLEY: We could try to stay and fight?

2284
01:24:48,998 --> 01:24:49,970
LIAM: Turn into a duergar! (cawing sounds)

2285
01:24:49,970 --> 01:24:52,991
LAURA: Turn into a duergar! Act like you’re a duergar! 
Say everything’s okay!

2286
01:24:52,991 --> 01:24:54,169
ASHLEY: Turn into a duergar?

2287
01:24:54,169 --> 01:24:55,160
SAM: Should we get out of here?

2288
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,091
ASHLEY: Yeah, let’s get out.

2289
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:57,146
SAM: Okay, we’re going to Dimension Door out.

2290
01:24:57,146 --> 01:25:00,812
MATT: Okay. So you grab her, (magic SFX) 
back down to the bottom.

2291
01:25:00,812 --> 01:25:01,913
TRAVIS: Cast that shit.

2292
01:25:01,913 --> 01:25:05,166
MATT: They reappear at the bottom.

2293
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:06,738
ORION: Are you done?

2294
01:25:06,738 --> 01:25:14,433
MARISHA: Okay, I cast Wall of Stone, but right 
over top of where I see that lip.

2295
01:25:14,433 --> 01:25:19,984
But I don't want to bring it out far. Just like, halfsies.

2296
01:25:19,984 --> 01:25:21,458
SAM: (laughs) Just the tip.

2297
01:25:21,458 --> 01:25:22,786
MARISHA: Just the tip.

2298
01:25:22,786 --> 01:25:23,957
ASHLEY: Does it stop the magma?

2299
01:25:23,957 --> 01:25:25,360
MATT: As you guys appear at the bottom--

2300
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,028
MARISHA: So it goes like magma flow, here's the wall, 
I want it to go - (grinding noise)

2301
01:25:28,028 --> 01:25:32,389
MATT: --you guys hear footprints along the wall. 
They don't seem to have seen you yet.

2302
01:25:32,389 --> 01:25:36,344
At which point there's this (grinding and thump sounds)
sound of shifting rock.

2303
01:25:36,344 --> 01:25:42,936
A giant stone wall juts out the side of the fortress 
right where the lava pool was pouring over the side.

2304
01:25:42,936 --> 01:25:48,179
As it does, the lava pools on top of the wall 
and is offset, leaving a small gap

2305
01:25:48,179 --> 01:25:50,164
where you guys can try to squeeze through.

2306
01:25:50,164 --> 01:25:54,507
You can see, right underneath where it was, 
there is a stone doorway.

2307
01:25:54,507 --> 01:25:58,793
It does not appear to have a handle or anything, 
it's just a stone door.

2308
01:25:58,793 --> 01:26:00,334
SAM: How do we get in?

2309
01:26:00,334 --> 01:26:01,637
LIAM: Tiberius, fly up there quick.

2310
01:26:01,637 --> 01:26:02,707
ORION: What?

2311
01:26:02,707 --> 01:26:04,532
LIAM: Stop eating chicken and fly up to that door.

2312
01:26:04,532 --> 01:26:05,729
ORION: Oh.

2313
01:26:05,729 --> 01:26:08,541
ASHLEY: Where did you get that chicken?

2314
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:10,211
ORION: What's going on?

2315
01:26:10,211 --> 01:26:13,282
LIAM: There's a magic doorway up there, I don't see 
any handles or anything.

2316
01:26:13,282 --> 01:26:15,335
MATT: It's right underneath the lava.

2317
01:26:15,335 --> 01:26:16,518
LIAM: Oh, it’s on the ground?

2318
01:26:16,518 --> 01:26:19,200
MATT: Basically she put the stone
wall out. It pours off.

2319
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:20,577
ORION: It's right there! What are you talking about?

2320
01:26:20,577 --> 01:26:22,323
LIAM: I walk up to it and take a look.

2321
01:26:22,323 --> 01:26:24,449
LAURA: Oh yeah, that was good. Maybe Grog can push it!

2322
01:26:24,449 --> 01:26:25,902
ORION: I'm going to do an Arcana check.

2323
01:26:25,902 --> 01:26:26,923
LIAM: Do I have advantage?

2324
01:26:26,923 --> 01:26:27,891
MATT: Uh, no.

2325
01:26:27,891 --> 01:26:28,999
LAURA: Can Grog push it?

2326
01:26:28,999 --> 01:26:29,928
LIAM: All right, take a look, dude.

2327
01:26:29,928 --> 01:26:30,694
TRAVIS: No, he's doing an arcana check.

2328
01:26:30,694 --> 01:26:32,065
SAM: Grog, just kill it!

2329
01:26:32,065 --> 01:26:33,533
MARISHA: (laughing) Go kill it, just punch the door!

2330
01:26:33,533 --> 01:26:34,839
ORION: 22.

2331
01:26:34,839 --> 01:26:39,479
MATT: 22? As you guys are inspecting this, 
in the time you've taken to do this,

2332
01:26:39,479 --> 01:26:45,239
both the duergar up on top have seen you, 
and are both taking shots at you.

2333
01:26:45,239 --> 01:26:47,113
SAM: Oh shit.

2334
01:26:47,113 --> 01:26:49,356
TALIESIN: I was waiting for that anyways 
so, I'm going to--

2335
01:26:49,356 --> 01:26:50,868
MARISHA: He was waiting.

2336
01:26:50,868 --> 01:26:54,478
MATT: As they appear on the top, you guys who have 
your arrow and gun at the ready,

2337
01:26:54,478 --> 01:26:56,386
both take a shot then they get a retribution shot.

2338
01:26:56,386 --> 01:26:57,455
LIAM: Keyleth!

2339
01:26:57,455 --> 01:26:58,269
MARISHA: What?

2340
01:26:58,269 --> 01:26:59,017
LIAM: Let's go up!

2341
01:26:59,017 --> 01:26:59,615
MARISHA: Go up?

2342
01:26:59,615 --> 01:27:00,754
LIAM: Up to them, quick.

2343
01:27:00,754 --> 01:27:02,071
MARISHA: I want see how they fare.

2344
01:27:02,071 --> 01:27:03,386
LIAM: That’s going to be about 6 seconds.

2345
01:27:03,386 --> 01:27:05,427
MATT: The door is not magical. It is a
mechanism of some kind.

2346
01:27:05,427 --> 01:27:06,817
LAURA: 65. Oh, 65? (laughter) Shit.

2347
01:27:06,817 --> 01:27:07,958
SAM: I rolled a 65.

2348
01:27:07,958 --> 01:27:09,098
LIAM: 65? Holy shit you're a deity!

2349
01:27:09,098 --> 01:27:10,546
LAURA: I'm amazing!

2350
01:27:12,099 --> 01:27:15,556
ORION: Vax. Pay attention, the door mechanical, 
it is not magical. That's how we open it.

2351
01:27:15,556 --> 01:27:16,413
LAURA: 25.

2352
01:27:16,413 --> 01:27:19,484
MATT: 25. Percy? And you get 2 attacks each. 
So - (zipping SFX)

2353
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:22,915
TALIESIN: I hit a 23.

2354
01:27:22,915 --> 01:27:24,767
MATT: 23 hits. Go ahead and roll second attack.

2355
01:27:24,767 --> 01:27:27,568
TALIESIN: Okay, roll damage.

2356
01:27:27,568 --> 01:27:29,331
MATT: Well, roll both attacks first.

2357
01:27:29,331 --> 01:27:30,571
LAURA: 18 for the second one.

2358
01:27:30,571 --> 01:27:31,582
MATT: Hits as well.

2359
01:27:31,582 --> 01:27:33,361
TALIESIN: I have to reload with my second attack.

2360
01:27:33,361 --> 01:27:35,617
MATT: Oh right. Is this with the Bad News?

2361
01:27:35,617 --> 01:27:36,825
TALIESIN: I've got the big gun out.

2362
01:27:36,825 --> 01:27:39,182
MATT: You’ve got the Bad News out. Okay then, 
yeah. So you fire and then reload.

2363
01:27:39,182 --> 01:27:42,913
Go ahead and roll damage.

2364
01:27:42,913 --> 01:27:45,392
LAURA: I'm using my fire bow.

2365
01:27:45,392 --> 01:27:48,696
MATT: You're using the fire bowstring. As you nock 
your first arrow, (swoosh sound) it bursts into flame

2366
01:27:48,696 --> 01:27:50,336
as it hits your fingers.

2367
01:27:50,336 --> 01:27:51,324
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

2368
01:27:51,324 --> 01:27:53,030
MARISHA: (dejected groan)

2369
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:54,303
TALIESIN: 7 damage.

2370
01:27:54,303 --> 01:27:55,826
MATT: 7 damage? Okay.

2371
01:27:55,826 --> 01:27:57,540
TALIESIN: I'm so embarrassed.

2372
01:27:57,540 --> 01:27:58,953
MATT: I'm sorry.

2373
01:27:58,953 --> 01:28:00,403
LIAM: (gunshot sound) You got me right in the ear.

2374
01:28:00,403 --> 01:28:01,643
LAURA: 20 damage on the first attack.

2375
01:28:01,643 --> 01:28:03,252
MATT: Okay.

2376
01:28:05,196 --> 01:28:06,836
MARISHA: Come on, Vex.

2377
01:28:06,836 --> 01:28:08,632
LAURA: 13 on the second.

2378
01:28:08,632 --> 01:28:16,033
MATT: Okay, as both are going up with their crossbows 
ready to go, first one, Bad News - (gunshot sound) -

2379
01:28:16,033 --> 01:28:19,170
with a cacophonous echoing gunshot 
that within this cavern,

2380
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:22,247
definitely carries some sound to it.

2381
01:28:22,247 --> 01:28:28,431
And to some degree, suprise may be a 
little harder to find going forward.

2382
01:28:28,431 --> 01:28:32,210
TALIESIN: They were ready to start shooting at us.

2383
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:36,399
MATT: However, the shot hits the guy in the shoulder,
knocks him off balance for a second.

2384
01:28:36,399 --> 01:28:39,747
Not enough of a wound to prevent his next action.

2385
01:28:39,747 --> 01:28:43,097
You, however, place one arrow into 
the other guy’s shoulder.

2386
01:28:43,097 --> 01:28:49,095
He's dropped the crossbow. As he goes to reach for his 
other weapon, the other one just,

2387
01:28:49,095 --> 01:28:51,821
right at the bottom of his throat, out the back of his head,
and he just drops below the wall.

2388
01:28:51,821 --> 01:28:53,301
ASHLEY: Awesome.

2389
01:28:53,301 --> 01:28:57,175
MATT: The other one does get a crossbow 
shot off at you, Percy.

2390
01:28:57,175 --> 01:29:00,292
That is a 23 versus armor class.

2391
01:29:00,292 --> 01:29:01,821
TALIESIN: That hits.

2392
01:29:01,835 --> 01:29:04,256
MATT: You take 9 points of piercing damage.

2393
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:07,516
As the bolt just streaks you across 
the front of your torso.

2394
01:29:07,516 --> 01:29:09,695
Passes through, thankfully, but you do feel there is

2395
01:29:09,695 --> 01:29:12,006
a wound that’s slowly turning warmer

2396
01:29:12,006 --> 01:29:13,159
beneath your armor.

2397
01:29:13,159 --> 01:29:15,283
LAURA: Can I shoot at the other one?

2398
01:29:15,283 --> 01:29:16,411
MATT: That's been the round.

2399
01:29:16,411 --> 01:29:18,577
Now, you guys have been inspecting the door.

2400
01:29:18,577 --> 01:29:21,789
The door is not magical. There is some sort of contraption 
that opens it from the inside.

2401
01:29:21,789 --> 01:29:25,497
LIAM: I’m getting my picks out, seeing if I 
can figure out some way to--

2402
01:29:25,497 --> 01:29:29,369
MATT: Go ahead and make a check with your thieves’ tools.

2403
01:29:31,194 --> 01:29:32,504
LIAM: 29.

2404
01:29:32,504 --> 01:29:36,846
MATT: A 29. You take a second and you find that the contraption

2405
01:29:36,846 --> 01:29:40,652
that holds this door in place definitely is on the other side. 
It's a series of winches and a chain pull.

2406
01:29:40,652 --> 01:29:45,368
You find that there is one slight gap where you manage 
to hook one of the chains, pull it out ever so slightly,

2407
01:29:45,368 --> 01:29:47,768
and you know with a strong yank from a strong person,

2408
01:29:47,768 --> 01:29:51,168
you could probably pull it out from the outside.

2409
01:29:51,168 --> 01:29:53,175
ORION: Grog!
TRAVIS: Sounds like we need a strong person.

2410
01:29:53,175 --> 01:29:54,822
LIAM: So this is the part where I ask Grog over to pull.

2411
01:29:54,822 --> 01:29:56,064
Grog, grab this--

2412
01:29:56,064 --> 01:29:57,672
ASHLEY: I'll do it! I'll do it.

2413
01:29:57,672 --> 01:29:59,693
(all laugh)

2414
01:29:59,693 --> 01:30:03,180
TRAVIS: Yeah, me and Pike are on this.

2415
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:04,599
ASHLEY: I'll assist.

2416
01:30:04,599 --> 01:30:07,909
MATT: Grog, you reach over and grab the chain, and Pike 
grabs onto the back of you and you both pull.

2417
01:30:07,909 --> 01:30:09,987
TRAVIS: Give it a good heave-ho.

2418
01:30:09,987 --> 01:30:12,242
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength 
check with advantage.

2419
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:16,556
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, 23.

2420
01:30:16,556 --> 01:30:21,827
MATT: 23. As you pull, you hear the grinding of this chain 
against the stone, (cracking SFX)

2421
01:30:21,827 --> 01:30:24,874
and you can see the actual door begin to 
rise upward this way.

2422
01:30:24,874 --> 01:30:27,298
SAM: It's a Delorean.

2423
01:30:27,298 --> 01:30:31,372
MATT: Essentially. When it opens up, it moves 
the magma out of the way.

2424
01:30:31,372 --> 01:30:34,317
That's how this construct is used as an exit.
It's what I mentioned before.

2425
01:30:34,317 --> 01:30:40,069
This is supposed to be an exit for the royal individuals 
of the stronghold.

2426
01:30:40,069 --> 01:30:44,326
It only opens part way, however, because the stone wall 
currently blocks the rest of its movement.

2427
01:30:44,326 --> 01:30:46,788
However, you can still move through it.

2428
01:30:46,788 --> 01:30:49,183
LIAM: We can't leave this duergar behind though, 
we gotta take him out.

2429
01:30:49,183 --> 01:30:52,462
MATT: Yes, there is one duergar still there.

2430
01:30:52,462 --> 01:30:56,095
So that's been all of your guys' actions. We're bringing
it back. Pike, you haven't gone yet.

2431
01:30:56,095 --> 01:30:57,964
ASHLEY: Okay.

2432
01:30:57,964 --> 01:31:03,250
MATT: Keyleth you've gone, so the only one left to 
take an action is--

2433
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:05,201
MARISHA: Tiberius, have you gone?

2434
01:31:05,201 --> 01:31:07,197
MATT: Yeah, he checked the doorway.

2435
01:31:07,197 --> 01:31:08,233
MARISHA: Oh right.

2436
01:31:08,233 --> 01:31:09,609
ASHLEY: Where's he at?

2437
01:31:09,609 --> 01:31:11,284
MATT: He's up on top of the wall, about 25 feet from you.

2438
01:31:11,284 --> 01:31:19,791
ASHLEY: I want to create a spiritual weapon, 
like a poisonous lasso, and (whiff SFX)

2439
01:31:19,791 --> 01:31:21,675
and then put him down into the lava.

2440
01:31:21,675 --> 01:31:24,300
MATT: Huh. Sure.

2441
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:26,410
(all laugh)

2442
01:31:26,410 --> 01:31:28,565
SAM: A lariat of truth?

2443
01:31:28,565 --> 01:31:30,123
TRAVIS: That's awesome.

2444
01:31:30,123 --> 01:31:31,464
TALIESIN: Well, all right then.

2445
01:31:31,464 --> 01:31:38,118
MATT: So using your spiritual weapon, you take a moment, 
you grasp your Sarenrae holy symbol around your neck,

2446
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:44,886
and as you pull your hand away from the symbol you see 
this glowing celestial rope extends out of nowhere.

2447
01:31:44,886 --> 01:31:49,857
You begin to spin your fingers, and on its own, 
it begins to swirl and swirl.

2448
01:31:49,857 --> 01:31:55,828
You then throw your hand forward and on its own, 
it cascades upward toward the edge of the wall.

2449
01:31:55,828 --> 01:31:58,204
Go ahead and roll an attack roll.

2450
01:31:58,204 --> 01:32:00,588
ASHLEY: An attack roll? Which is?

2451
01:32:00,588 --> 01:32:02,947
MATT: Using your spell modifier as the attack bonus.

2452
01:32:09,719 --> 01:32:11,558
ASHLEY: 10.

2453
01:32:11,558 --> 01:32:14,168
SAM: Ooh. That ain't gonna do it.

2454
01:32:14,168 --> 01:32:16,476
MATT: Total of 10?

2455
01:32:16,476 --> 01:32:18,557
ASHLEY: I think so.

2456
01:32:18,557 --> 01:32:19,774
(all laugh)

2457
01:32:19,774 --> 01:32:21,140
MATT: What'd you roll?

2458
01:32:21,140 --> 01:32:24,450
ASHLEY: I rolled a 2, and then I have a plus 8.

2459
01:32:24,450 --> 01:32:26,544
MATT: Okay.

2460
01:32:26,544 --> 01:32:29,795
SAM: That ain't no good.

2461
01:32:29,795 --> 01:32:31,564
LIAM: It was a good idea though.

2462
01:32:31,564 --> 01:32:33,135
LAURA: It was such a good idea.

2463
01:32:33,135 --> 01:32:36,530
MATT: The celestial lasso, which you don't get the feeling
poison is something you could really muster

2464
01:32:36,530 --> 01:32:38,803
based on your deity's central good--

2465
01:32:38,803 --> 01:32:42,369
ASHLEY: I was just kidding! I was just getting 
a little crazy with ideas.

2466
01:32:42,369 --> 01:32:48,706
MATT: I like it. However, as it heads over the wall, 
you see it does not find purchase on the duergar.

2467
01:32:48,706 --> 01:32:50,592
It instead finds purchase on part of the wall.

2468
01:32:50,592 --> 01:32:51,689
ASHLEY: Fuck.

2469
01:32:51,689 --> 01:32:53,385
TRAVIS: Poisoning the wall effectively.

2470
01:32:53,385 --> 01:32:56,139
MATT: Yes, it is now a poisoned property.

2471
01:32:56,139 --> 01:32:58,340
ASHLEY: (laughs) Poisoning that wall, effectively. 
Gosh dang it. That would have been cool.

2472
01:32:58,340 --> 01:32:59,746
MATT: That would have been cool, unfortunate bad roll.

2473
01:32:59,746 --> 01:33:00,989
TRAVIS: It was going to be pretty cool.

2474
01:33:00,989 --> 01:33:02,119
LIAM: Remember it for the future though.

2475
01:33:02,119 --> 01:33:03,492
MATT: That brings us to the top of the round order.

2476
01:33:03,492 --> 01:33:06,866
I believe at the top we have--

2477
01:33:06,866 --> 01:33:08,153
SAM: Mister Me?

2478
01:33:08,153 --> 01:33:09,229
MATT: Yes, Scanlan.

2479
01:33:09,229 --> 01:33:14,513
SAM: Okay. Boy, oh boy.

2480
01:33:17,443 --> 01:33:21,266
We're still trying to get that fucker up on the roof right?

2481
01:33:21,266 --> 01:33:22,629
LIAM: Yes, he's going to run and tell people.

2482
01:33:22,629 --> 01:33:25,170
SAM: I've got almost nothing. So I'll just -

2483
01:33:29,309 --> 01:33:34,036
can I summon an Unseen Servant to push him?

2484
01:33:34,036 --> 01:33:36,696
(all laugh)

2485
01:33:36,696 --> 01:33:39,524
MARISHA: Oh yeah, that's a good idea.

2486
01:33:39,524 --> 01:33:41,341
MATT: We can give it a shot.

2487
01:33:41,341 --> 01:33:43,768
TRAVIS: Roll high. Roll really high.

2488
01:33:43,768 --> 01:33:45,672
SAM: I don't have any ranged weapons.

2489
01:33:45,672 --> 01:33:47,168
LAURA: Natural 20!

2490
01:33:47,168 --> 01:33:49,556
MATT: So you conjure Unseen Servant.
Mark off your spell use.

2491
01:33:49,556 --> 01:33:52,076
ORION: I look up and go, “Ooh, It's Monty's cousin.”

2492
01:33:52,076 --> 01:33:56,668
MATT: You see a slight shimmer of ethereal energy 
behind the duergar.

2493
01:33:56,668 --> 01:34:01,146
It's going to attempt to shove him. 
It isn't, unfortunately, on its own, extremely strong.

2494
01:34:01,146 --> 01:34:05,786
It's mainly meant as an aide. However, it is possible. 
Go ahead and make an athletics check.

2495
01:34:05,786 --> 01:34:08,198
Not your athletics, just make a d20 roll.

2496
01:34:08,198 --> 01:34:09,990
SAM: Just a normal athletics.

2497
01:34:09,990 --> 01:34:11,114
LIAM: Come on, 20.

2498
01:34:11,114 --> 01:34:12,580
SAM: Yeah, I mean it's a 5, so.

2499
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:14,396
(all laugh)

2500
01:34:14,396 --> 01:34:17,027
ASHLEY: What's your athletics? We're 
really rolling well tonight.

2501
01:34:17,027 --> 01:34:22,326
MATT: You hear a (ting) sound as the duergar's
armor is given a hefty slap,

2502
01:34:22,326 --> 01:34:24,201
but no apparent force is placed upon its body.

2503
01:34:24,201 --> 01:34:25,779
ORION: A hefty slap.

2504
01:34:25,779 --> 01:34:27,185
SAM: Thank you, Jarvis!

2505
01:34:27,185 --> 01:34:28,837
(all laugh)

2506
01:34:28,837 --> 01:34:30,773
SAM: But is he confused?

2507
01:34:30,773 --> 01:34:35,693
MATT: A little bit, but not enough to not be loading 
his crossbow for a second shot.

2508
01:34:35,693 --> 01:34:37,268
SAM: Damn it!

2509
01:34:37,268 --> 01:34:38,946
MATT: Good thinking on that point.

2510
01:34:38,946 --> 01:34:42,641
MARISHA: We're a party of 7 people just like, 
“Aw, damn it, you!"

2511
01:34:42,641 --> 01:34:46,710
TALIESIN: Like a cat in a tree, just - (beckoning whistle)

2512
01:34:46,710 --> 01:34:52,482
SAM: And I'm going to just give a little 
inspiration to Vax. That's Laura, obviously.

2513
01:34:52,482 --> 01:34:54,264
(all laugh)

2514
01:34:54,264 --> 01:34:55,514
LAURA: Yes, thank you.

2515
01:34:55,514 --> 01:34:57,537
MARISHA: It inverted. That's what I always get mixed.

2516
01:34:57,537 --> 01:34:59,624
MATT: All right, a d8 inspiration die to you as Scanlan
hums a little tune under his breath.

2517
01:34:59,624 --> 01:35:00,970
LAURA: Nice.

2518
01:35:00,970 --> 01:35:03,653
SAM: (hums Dueling Banjos)
MATT: You're up.

2519
01:35:03,653 --> 01:35:05,622
LAURA: Oh! I attack him.

2520
01:35:05,622 --> 01:35:06,950
MATT: All right.

2521
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:08,139
MARISHA: Pew pew.

2522
01:35:08,139 --> 01:35:09,398
ASHLEY: Pew pew!

2523
01:35:10,127 --> 01:35:11,139
LAURA: It's good.

2524
01:35:11,139 --> 01:35:12,188
LIAM: It's a 1.

2525
01:35:12,188 --> 01:35:13,707
MARISHA: Damn it! What is wrong with us?

2526
01:35:13,707 --> 01:35:15,271
TRAVIS: What in the hot and holy shit is happening right now?

2527
01:35:15,271 --> 01:35:16,290
ASHLEY: What are we doing?
MATT: That's your first attack?

2528
01:35:16,290 --> 01:35:18,422
LAURA: My first attack is a serious fail. 
My second attack, though, is a 25.

2529
01:35:18,422 --> 01:35:19,404
MATT: That hits.

2530
01:35:19,404 --> 01:35:20,405
MARISHA: That's pretty cool.

2531
01:35:20,405 --> 01:35:23,367
MATT: So the first one you pull back, and as you pull back 
the actual arrow snaps.

2532
01:35:23,367 --> 01:35:24,935
LIAM: You almost shot me!

2533
01:35:24,935 --> 01:35:26,777
LAURA: Ow, that hurt my arm so bad.

2534
01:35:26,777 --> 01:35:28,246
MATT: Yeah, you're gonna have a little rash there 
probably tomorrow.

2535
01:35:28,246 --> 01:35:30,816
LAURA: Great. 8.

2536
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:32,307
MATT: 8 damage, all right.

2537
01:35:32,307 --> 01:35:35,169
Your second arrow manages to find its mark.

2538
01:35:35,169 --> 01:35:42,788
As it sticks pretty close to where the first arrow hit, 
or where he was shot from the Bad News.

2539
01:35:42,788 --> 01:35:48,700
The duergar just shrugs it off angrily, and aims 
his crossbow from once on Percy, now onto you.

2540
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:49,998
LAURA: (nervously) Haha.

2541
01:35:49,998 --> 01:35:51,698
MATT: It's getting its shot at you.

2542
01:35:51,698 --> 01:35:54,007
That is a 17 versus armor class.

2543
01:35:54,007 --> 01:35:54,915
LAURA: Nope.

2544
01:35:54,915 --> 01:35:55,818
MATT: Nope?

2545
01:35:55,818 --> 01:35:56,812
LAURA: Nope.

2546
01:35:56,812 --> 01:36:02,072
MATT: You manage to just dodge out of the way. 
You hear it whiz past your ear.

2547
01:36:02,072 --> 01:36:04,455
That brings us to Percy.

2548
01:36:04,455 --> 01:36:06,102
TALIESIN: I'll take one more shot at him.

2549
01:36:06,102 --> 01:36:07,335
LIAM: Redemption, Percy.

2550
01:36:07,335 --> 01:36:08,464
TRAVIS: Come on, buddy.

2551
01:36:08,464 --> 01:36:09,422
SAM: Kill this guy.

2552
01:36:09,422 --> 01:36:10,412
ASHLEY: Get it.

2553
01:36:10,412 --> 01:36:11,944
SAM: He's lasted longer than most of the people we fight.

2554
01:36:11,944 --> 01:36:13,515
MARISHA: (laughing) Yeah he has.

2555
01:36:13,515 --> 01:36:14,758
TALIESIN: 18?

2556
01:36:14,758 --> 01:36:17,391
MATT: 18 hits.

2557
01:36:17,391 --> 01:36:19,114
TALIESIN: Come on die.

2558
01:36:19,114 --> 01:36:20,299
TRAVIS: Come on, Percy.

2559
01:36:20,299 --> 01:36:21,359
LIAM: Right in the belly button.

2560
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:23,210
MARISHA: Oh, that's nice. That's pretty.

2561
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:26,558
TALIESIN: That's 25 points of damage.

2562
01:36:26,558 --> 01:36:27,782
TRAVIS: Thank you!

2563
01:36:27,782 --> 01:36:29,005
LAURA: Yes!

2564
01:36:29,005 --> 01:36:35,421
MATT: With a second (click), you pull out one of your custom made,
nasty looking bullets, load it back into Bad News.

2565
01:36:35,421 --> 01:36:39,959
You pull it back, aim up, and fire. And once again, 
you guys are seeing this weapon up close again.

2566
01:36:39,959 --> 01:36:44,867
With each fire, it takes all of his physical body to not get 
blown off his feet with each time it fires.

2567
01:36:44,867 --> 01:36:46,794
LAURA: That's badass, Percy.

2568
01:36:46,794 --> 01:36:52,600
MATT: (thunder crack) A plume of white and ash-like smoke 
comes shooting out the side of the weapon.

2569
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:56,380
Nearby, you almost have to close your ears instinctually
from the loudness of the shot.

2570
01:36:56,380 --> 01:36:58,355
However, the duergar at the top of the wall,

2571
01:36:58,355 --> 01:37:02,882
you see where his head once was just (wet impact SFX) 
across the wall behind it.

2572
01:37:02,882 --> 01:37:04,539
ASHLEY: I love Bad News.

2573
01:37:04,539 --> 01:37:05,633
TALIESIN: Let's move quickly.

2574
01:37:05,633 --> 01:37:06,488
LAURA: Let's get in the door.

2575
01:37:06,488 --> 01:37:07,429
SAM: I think they heard us.

2576
01:37:07,429 --> 01:37:08,610
ORION: I go in the door.

2577
01:37:08,610 --> 01:37:10,078
TALIESIN: Going in the door.

2578
01:37:10,078 --> 01:37:11,787
LAURA: We all go in the door.

2579
01:37:11,787 --> 01:37:14,645
MATT: All of you have made your way into the doorway.

2580
01:37:14,645 --> 01:37:16,377
LAURA: Can Trinket fit? Trinket can fit.

2581
01:37:16,377 --> 01:37:18,875
MATT: Trinket can fit with you, yes.

2582
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:20,139
LIAM: Just barely.

2583
01:37:20,139 --> 01:37:21,667
ASHLEY: Just bear-ly.

2584
01:37:21,667 --> 01:37:22,859
LIAM: It's like Winnie the Pooh, in the--

2585
01:37:22,859 --> 01:37:25,081
LAURA: If Grog can fit, Trinket can fit.

2586
01:37:27,071 --> 01:37:28,979
TALIESIN: It’s the one you don’t suit.

2587
01:37:28,979 --> 01:37:31,919
TRAVIS: Oh no, we can't see anything.

2588
01:37:33,629 --> 01:37:38,826
MATT: You guys make your way into this tiny little room--

2589
01:37:38,826 --> 01:37:40,474
ALL: Whoa!

2590
01:37:40,474 --> 01:37:43,757
MATT: You're all very crammed in, to get anywhere.

2591
01:37:43,757 --> 01:37:46,109
LAURA: Into this (high voice) teeny-tiny little room.

2592
01:37:46,109 --> 01:37:48,339
LIAM: Feels like an intermission room.

2593
01:37:48,339 --> 01:37:52,547
LAURA: Oh. A bathroom break room?

2594
01:37:52,547 --> 01:37:56,029
LIAM: Yes. We could all relieve ourselves in this room.

2595
01:37:59,037 --> 01:38:02,921
MATT: You guys all slowly push into this storage room.

2596
01:38:02,921 --> 01:38:06,326
It's very musty. It hasn't seen use in quite a while.

2597
01:38:06,326 --> 01:38:10,145
In fact, you can see a little bit of mold is growing 
on the side of one of the barrels in the corner.

2598
01:38:10,145 --> 01:38:11,789
ORION: Ooh, dank.

2599
01:38:11,789 --> 01:38:15,478
MATT: There is a doorway that is closed on 
the opposite side of this wall,

2600
01:38:15,478 --> 01:38:19,295
and from what you can see, there is a stairway 
that curves upwards to the second floor.

2601
01:38:19,295 --> 01:38:21,017
LAURA: Ooh!

2602
01:38:21,017 --> 01:38:23,564
SAM: Guys, I'm sensing a lot of purple and brown 
construction paper here.

2603
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:25,677
(all laugh)

2604
01:38:25,677 --> 01:38:27,580
ORION: I am as well, Scanlan.

2605
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:28,899
LIAM: That's your favored terrain, right?

2606
01:38:28,899 --> 01:38:29,981
SAM: It is.

2607
01:38:29,981 --> 01:38:33,171
(all laugh)

2608
01:38:34,283 --> 01:38:36,864
LAURA: Can we take an intermission break at this moment?

2609
01:38:36,864 --> 01:38:38,642
MATT: I think as you guys just entered the stronghold,

2610
01:38:38,642 --> 01:38:40,639
we'll take this as an intermission break.

2611
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:45,175
So take a little over 10 minutes. We'll watch the rest of the 
videos here again, and we'll return

2612
01:38:45,175 --> 01:38:49,114
as the party has just entered the Emberhold itself.

2613
01:38:49,114 --> 01:38:50,597
LAURA: All right. Oh wait, quick announcement.

2614
01:38:50,597 --> 01:38:52,160
ZAC: A couple quick announcements.

2615
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:53,390
LIAM: Zac matches the construction paper.

2616
01:38:53,390 --> 01:38:54,162
LAURA: What?!

2617
01:38:54,162 --> 01:38:55,036
MARISHA: You do!

2618
01:38:55,036 --> 01:38:56,626
(all laugh)

2619
01:38:56,626 --> 01:38:58,137
ZAC: You can't see me!

2620
01:38:58,137 --> 01:38:59,749
So guys before we go on intermission,

2621
01:38:59,749 --> 01:39:01,984
I wanted to bring up one more time 826LA

2622
01:39:01,984 --> 01:39:07,055
which is the charity that Critical Role is supporting.

2623
01:39:07,055 --> 01:39:08,512
Do you want to give a brief--

2624
01:39:08,512 --> 01:39:13,854
MARISHA: Yeah. A portion of our proceeds, or whatever 
our donations are, go to 826LA.

2625
01:39:13,854 --> 01:39:16,166
They are an after-school tutoring program that help

2626
01:39:16,166 --> 01:39:18,448
children between the ages of 5 and 18,

2627
01:39:18,448 --> 01:39:21,084
mainly with literacy and creative writing and they have

2628
01:39:21,084 --> 01:39:25,489
this awesome program where it's a young authors thing.

2629
01:39:25,489 --> 01:39:29,262
You can buy all their books and their stories, and 
you should totally check them out.

2630
01:39:29,262 --> 01:39:30,217
ZAC: Sweet!

2631
01:39:30,217 --> 01:39:31,165
MATT: Fantastic.

2632
01:39:31,165 --> 01:39:33,452
ZAC: So guys, we can spam you with that link in the chatroom

2633
01:39:33,452 --> 01:39:36,031
if you want to support a charity for Critical Role.

2634
01:39:36,031 --> 01:39:39,801
We also still have a giveaway at 2150 subs,

2635
01:39:39,801 --> 01:39:42,803
which is a picture of the entire Critical Role cast

2636
01:39:42,803 --> 01:39:46,046
they've all signed, and it's really cool.

2637
01:39:46,046 --> 01:39:48,115
We'll show that to you guys again later, but we'll go ahead

2638
01:39:48,115 --> 01:39:50,644
and roll those videos for you guys again.

2639
01:39:50,644 --> 01:39:53,320
MATT: See if we can squeeze the intro 
again, that would be best.

2640
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:55,994
All right, cool guys, we'll see you again in a little bit.

2641
01:39:56,874 --> 01:39:58,784
ASHLEY: Pike grew up in the outskirts of town,

2642
01:39:58,784 --> 01:40:00,252
near the Bramblewood.

2643
01:40:00,252 --> 01:40:02,081
Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes

2644
01:40:02,081 --> 01:40:04,949
with quite an unfavorable reputation.

2645
01:40:04,949 --> 01:40:08,006
Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them

2646
01:40:08,006 --> 01:40:10,914
with the curse of the last name Trickfoot.

2647
01:40:10,914 --> 01:40:13,972
Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption,

2648
01:40:13,972 --> 01:40:16,465
had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather,

2649
01:40:16,465 --> 01:40:19,052
Wilhand, who left his family at a young age

2650
01:40:19,052 --> 01:40:21,087
after a dream.

2651
01:40:21,087 --> 01:40:22,951
A dream that changed the course

2652
01:40:22,951 --> 01:40:24,387
of the Trickfoot family.

2653
01:40:24,387 --> 01:40:26,806
Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae

2654
01:40:26,806 --> 01:40:28,962
and pledged from then on that him and his family

2655
01:40:28,962 --> 01:40:31,987
would live a life of service and devotion.

2656
01:40:31,987 --> 01:40:36,033
As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal.

2657
01:40:36,033 --> 01:40:40,371
Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers,

2658
01:40:40,371 --> 01:40:43,176
she felt she had a purpose in making things whole

2659
01:40:43,176 --> 01:40:45,164
that had once been broken.

2660
01:40:45,164 --> 01:40:47,194
She studied and learned the ways to heal

2661
01:40:47,194 --> 01:40:48,677
through divine magic.

2662
01:40:48,677 --> 01:40:51,824
She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple,

2663
01:40:51,824 --> 01:40:54,417
until one day, Wilhand was captured

2664
01:40:54,417 --> 01:40:57,758
and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians.

2665
01:40:57,758 --> 01:40:59,515
One of the goliaths took a stand

2666
01:40:59,515 --> 01:41:01,570
against the murder of the innocent gnome

2667
01:41:01,570 --> 01:41:05,298
and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead,

2668
01:41:05,298 --> 01:41:07,492
abandoned by his herd.

2669
01:41:07,492 --> 01:41:09,770
Wilhand went to Pike for help.

2670
01:41:09,770 --> 01:41:11,705
She prayed and healed this barbarian

2671
01:41:11,705 --> 01:41:15,377
as best she could, bringing him back to life.

2672
01:41:15,377 --> 01:41:18,612
When he awoke, she discovered his name

2673
01:41:18,612 --> 01:41:21,120
was Grog Strongjaw.

2674
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:23,476
After that, they were best of friends,

2675
01:41:23,476 --> 01:41:25,765
a rather unlikely pair.

2676
01:41:25,765 --> 01:41:28,760
Little did she know that in a few years' time

2677
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:30,866
Grog would soon return the favor

2678
01:41:30,866 --> 01:41:33,835
and bring her back from the clutches of death.

2679
01:41:33,835 --> 01:41:36,835
(roar) (wet smack sounds)

2680
01:41:36,835 --> 01:41:38,566
After being killed in battle,

2681
01:41:38,566 --> 01:41:40,006
Pike felt angry.

2682
01:41:40,006 --> 01:41:41,388
She wanted to be stronger

2683
01:41:41,388 --> 01:41:43,569
so that it would never happen again.

2684
01:41:43,569 --> 01:41:45,392
She spent four months at sea

2685
01:41:45,392 --> 01:41:46,865
training with the men and women

2686
01:41:46,865 --> 01:41:49,948
aboard a ship called the Broken Howl.

2687
01:41:49,948 --> 01:41:52,506
Gripping her holy symbol in one hand,

2688
01:41:52,506 --> 01:41:54,676
and her morningstar in the other,

2689
01:41:54,676 --> 01:41:56,759
this time, Pike is ready.

2690
01:41:58,958 --> 01:42:01,934
TRAVIS: Right, Listen up! If you have ale,

2691
01:42:01,934 --> 01:42:05,968
then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw!

2692
01:42:05,968 --> 01:42:09,711
A goliath of towering height and size,

2693
01:42:09,711 --> 01:42:13,342
this barbarian has an appetite for the two great

2694
01:42:13,342 --> 01:42:18,758
loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (chuckle)

2695
01:42:18,758 --> 01:42:19,835
(record scratch)

2696
01:42:19,835 --> 01:42:20,667
Wait.

2697
01:42:20,667 --> 01:42:23,440
Easily the brains of the group,

2698
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:26,407
Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge

2699
01:42:26,407 --> 01:42:30,500
of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things!

2700
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:32,556
...also ale.

2701
01:42:32,556 --> 01:42:36,552
In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe,

2702
01:42:36,552 --> 01:42:39,493
Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks

2703
01:42:39,493 --> 01:42:42,235
of his family's wandering herd.

2704
01:42:42,235 --> 01:42:46,525
But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods,

2705
01:42:46,525 --> 01:42:50,721
he objected to the killing such an innocent life.

2706
01:42:50,721 --> 01:42:55,616
A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this...

2707
01:42:55,616 --> 01:42:58,551
well this terrified little thing.

2708
01:42:58,551 --> 01:43:01,602
And his disobedience cost him dearly.

2709
01:43:01,602 --> 01:43:02,876
(weapon crack)

2710
01:43:02,876 --> 01:43:05,722
Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader,

2711
01:43:05,722 --> 01:43:07,050
his uncle Kevdak,

2712
01:43:07,050 --> 01:43:10,704
Grog was abandoned and left to die.

2713
01:43:10,704 --> 01:43:13,808
Exiled from his herd, it was then that

2714
01:43:13,808 --> 01:43:17,217
the relative of the very gnome he fought to save

2715
01:43:17,217 --> 01:43:19,364
saved him.

2716
01:43:19,364 --> 01:43:22,915
It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike

2717
01:43:22,915 --> 01:43:26,775
that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge.

2718
01:43:26,775 --> 01:43:30,431
And they have remained close friends ever since.

2719
01:43:30,431 --> 01:43:32,182
(brawling sounds)

2720
01:43:32,182 --> 01:43:34,227
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging

2721
01:43:34,227 --> 01:43:36,525
entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha!

2722
01:43:36,525 --> 01:43:39,400
...or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house,

2723
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:41,653
where you pay for...

2724
01:43:41,653 --> 01:43:43,322
lady favors.

2725
01:43:43,322 --> 01:43:45,153
Also ale!

2726
01:43:46,571 --> 01:43:48,422
MARISHA: A first Impression of Keyleth would

2727
01:43:48,422 --> 01:43:49,908
leave you with little information

2728
01:43:49,908 --> 01:43:51,797
on the half-elven druid.

2729
01:43:51,797 --> 01:43:54,029
You might even think that her social awkwardness

2730
01:43:54,029 --> 01:43:56,601
due to her sheltered upbringing is kinda sweet.

2731
01:43:56,601 --> 01:43:57,726
(chuckle)

2732
01:43:57,726 --> 01:44:01,210
Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her

2733
01:44:01,210 --> 01:44:02,798
based on first impressions.

2734
01:44:02,798 --> 01:44:03,992
(thunder crack)

2735
01:44:03,992 --> 01:44:06,629
Under that unintimidating petite frame is a

2736
01:44:06,629 --> 01:44:09,261
vicious beast waiting to be unleashed,

2737
01:44:09,261 --> 01:44:11,517
whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of

2738
01:44:11,517 --> 01:44:14,937
champions pee their pants, literally!

2739
01:44:14,937 --> 01:44:16,159
(soft chuckle)

2740
01:44:16,159 --> 01:44:18,347
Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people,

2741
01:44:18,347 --> 01:44:20,445
Keyleth was raised with a deep love

2742
01:44:20,445 --> 01:44:23,234
of nature and the elemental magics.

2743
01:44:23,234 --> 01:44:26,008
It is her people’s inherent duty to protect the

2744
01:44:26,008 --> 01:44:27,740
delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

2745
01:44:27,740 --> 01:44:31,725
where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm.

2746
01:44:31,725 --> 01:44:34,321
Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack

2747
01:44:34,321 --> 01:44:37,102
for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities.

2748
01:44:37,102 --> 01:44:39,454
Well, if you consider kittens and

2749
01:44:39,454 --> 01:44:42,219
flying squirrels to be little beasts.

2750
01:44:42,219 --> 01:44:43,569
Which, I do.

2751
01:44:43,569 --> 01:44:44,828
(clears throat)

2752
01:44:44,828 --> 01:44:47,883
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe,

2753
01:44:47,883 --> 01:44:49,489
her father, Kohren,

2754
01:44:49,489 --> 01:44:51,697
realized her true prodigious abilities and

2755
01:44:51,697 --> 01:44:56,033
she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster.

2756
01:44:56,033 --> 01:44:59,225
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and

2757
01:44:59,225 --> 01:45:01,720
replaced with endless spell memorization,

2758
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:03,415
teachings from ancient traditions,

2759
01:45:03,415 --> 01:45:06,245
and exceedingly high expectations.

2760
01:45:06,245 --> 01:45:08,953
Every druid leader-to-be must embark on journey

2761
01:45:08,953 --> 01:45:10,390
to seek out the sister tribes

2762
01:45:10,390 --> 01:45:12,679
in order to introduce and establish respect

2763
01:45:12,679 --> 01:45:14,987
amongst the fellow headmasters.

2764
01:45:14,987 --> 01:45:19,258
They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey.

2765
01:45:19,258 --> 01:45:22,120
When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path

2766
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:24,284
to truly discovering herself.

2767
01:45:24,284 --> 01:45:27,639
Not knowing when, or if she will ever return.

2768
01:45:27,639 --> 01:45:30,320
As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben,

2769
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:33,028
she meditated on the task ahead.

2770
01:45:33,028 --> 01:45:35,703
Part of the Aramente is proving yourself

2771
01:45:35,703 --> 01:45:38,370
a strong warrior, a valiant protector,

2772
01:45:38,370 --> 01:45:40,889
and a wise and compassionate leader.

2773
01:45:40,889 --> 01:45:43,309
With this knowledge, one thought plays

2774
01:45:43,309 --> 01:45:45,511
in repeat in her mind:

2775
01:45:45,511 --> 01:45:48,178
Is she even worthy?

2776
01:45:50,603 --> 01:45:52,767
TALIESIN: Percy was the third child of 7 children,

2777
01:45:52,767 --> 01:45:54,814
born to a noble family who lived far to the

2778
01:45:54,814 --> 01:45:58,117
north in the ancient castle of Whitestone.

2779
01:45:58,117 --> 01:46:00,331
With so many siblings to share the burdens of

2780
01:46:00,331 --> 01:46:02,402
lordship, Percy turned his attention to the

2781
01:46:02,402 --> 01:46:06,113
sciences, engineering, and naturalism.

2782
01:46:06,113 --> 01:46:08,350
One day, a mysterious couple

2783
01:46:08,350 --> 01:46:11,165
named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court.

2784
01:46:11,165 --> 01:46:13,069
During a feast held in their honor,

2785
01:46:13,069 --> 01:46:15,995
the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle,

2786
01:46:15,995 --> 01:46:20,192
killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way.

2787
01:46:20,192 --> 01:46:22,307
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon,

2788
01:46:22,307 --> 01:46:24,770
only to be freed by his younger sister.

2789
01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:28,452
Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods’ men.

2790
01:46:28,452 --> 01:46:30,754
As they ran, Percy’s sister took

2791
01:46:30,754 --> 01:46:33,595
several arrows to the chest and fell.

2792
01:46:33,595 --> 01:46:35,895
Percy kept running, eventually jumping into

2793
01:46:35,895 --> 01:46:39,612
a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom.

2794
01:46:39,612 --> 01:46:42,459
He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat.

2795
01:46:42,459 --> 01:46:44,515
He barely remembered the next two years, as he

2796
01:46:44,515 --> 01:46:48,461
slowly made his way as far south as possible.

2797
01:46:48,461 --> 01:46:51,283
Then one night, Percy had a dream.

2798
01:46:51,283 --> 01:46:53,604
A roaring cloud of smoke offered him

2799
01:46:53,604 --> 01:46:56,898
vengeance against those who destroyed his family.

2800
01:46:56,898 --> 01:47:01,299
When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun.

2801
01:47:01,299 --> 01:47:03,749
(click sound) (gunshot)

2802
01:47:04,324 --> 01:47:07,302
SAM: Oh, you haven’t heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?

2803
01:47:07,302 --> 01:47:08,815
Well, gird your loins, ladies,

2804
01:47:08,815 --> 01:47:11,023
because he has his eye on you.

2805
01:47:11,023 --> 01:47:13,615
A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly

2806
01:47:13,615 --> 01:47:17,292
handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs

2807
01:47:17,292 --> 01:47:20,320
almost as much as he sings his own praises.

2808
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:23,337
Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless

2809
01:47:23,337 --> 01:47:25,242
charm and soaring tenor voice to

2810
01:47:25,242 --> 01:47:28,113
croon for coin and support his single mother.

2811
01:47:28,113 --> 01:47:31,081
One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter

2812
01:47:31,081 --> 01:47:35,110
and joined Dr. Dranzel’s Spectacular Traveling Troupe

2813
01:47:35,110 --> 01:47:37,341
where he learned the ways of the world,

2814
01:47:37,341 --> 01:47:40,868
and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire.

2815
01:47:40,868 --> 01:47:43,463
A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite

2816
01:47:43,463 --> 01:47:44,864
come to terms with the violent

2817
01:47:44,864 --> 01:47:48,207
death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion.

2818
01:47:48,207 --> 01:47:51,304
While his years on the road provided many, shall we say,

2819
01:47:51,304 --> 01:47:54,714
educational experiences with the opposite sex,

2820
01:47:54,714 --> 01:47:57,486
deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing

2821
01:47:57,486 --> 01:47:59,829
he’s never known: the true love

2822
01:47:59,829 --> 01:48:01,839
of a fellow gnome.

2823
01:48:01,839 --> 01:48:05,330
Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first,

2824
01:48:05,330 --> 01:48:08,726
performer second, and fighter distant third.

2825
01:48:08,726 --> 01:48:10,890
On the battlefield, he’ll support his allies,

2826
01:48:10,890 --> 01:48:14,051
but rarely draws blood unless it’s to protect

2827
01:48:14,051 --> 01:48:17,925
fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh,

2828
01:48:17,925 --> 01:48:21,626
a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts

2829
01:48:21,626 --> 01:48:24,374
and makes the females swoon.

2830
01:48:26,744 --> 01:48:29,060
ORION: Greetings and salutations.

2831
01:48:29,060 --> 01:48:31,248
I am Tiberius Stormwind.

2832
01:48:31,248 --> 01:48:33,523
I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

2833
01:48:33,523 --> 01:48:35,721
located in the heart of Draconia,

2834
01:48:35,721 --> 01:48:38,028
born from a politically respected family.

2835
01:48:38,028 --> 01:48:41,387
At the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer’s Rite,

2836
01:48:41,387 --> 01:48:43,677
showing prodigy-like control of my magic.

2837
01:48:43,677 --> 01:48:46,417
The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at

2838
01:48:46,417 --> 01:48:49,874
how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training.

2839
01:48:49,874 --> 01:48:52,436
At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member

2840
01:48:52,436 --> 01:48:55,178
of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the

2841
01:48:55,178 --> 01:48:56,956
next few years, I almost went mad from the

2842
01:48:56,956 --> 01:48:58,940
malaise of being a guild member,

2843
01:48:58,940 --> 01:49:01,400
as it’s rather boring.

2844
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:04,010
However, one day I happened upon a chamber,

2845
01:49:04,010 --> 01:49:05,997
unused for quite some time.

2846
01:49:05,997 --> 01:49:08,445
In the room were stacks of books and maps

2847
01:49:08,445 --> 01:49:09,963
of the surrounding cities and areas

2848
01:49:09,963 --> 01:49:11,381
around the known world.

2849
01:49:11,381 --> 01:49:13,752
For months I would frequent the chamber, and learned

2850
01:49:13,752 --> 01:49:15,728
of artifacts from legend.

2851
01:49:15,728 --> 01:49:18,639
After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts

2852
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:20,022
that caught my eye.

2853
01:49:20,022 --> 01:49:22,202
I brought these findings to the high council and was told that

2854
01:49:22,202 --> 01:49:25,499
all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon

2855
01:49:25,499 --> 01:49:29,113
was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries,

2856
01:49:29,113 --> 01:49:31,276
and hence were lost forever.

2857
01:49:31,276 --> 01:49:34,038
I found those answers to be unacceptable.

2858
01:49:34,038 --> 01:49:36,351
A year later I devised a ruse and managed to

2859
01:49:36,351 --> 01:49:38,303
convince the city council to lend support

2860
01:49:38,303 --> 01:49:40,360
in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace

2861
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:42,937
and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms.

2862
01:49:42,937 --> 01:49:45,455
Going from town to town and making friends and allies,

2863
01:49:45,455 --> 01:49:47,358
in and for the name of Draconia.

2864
01:49:47,358 --> 01:49:49,309
Being a red dragonborn,

2865
01:49:49,309 --> 01:49:52,299
I had quite the task on my hands in that respect,

2866
01:49:52,299 --> 01:49:54,975
but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore

2867
01:49:54,975 --> 01:49:56,988
the world and find these artifacts,

2868
01:49:56,988 --> 01:49:59,659
as I felt the truth was out there.

2869
01:49:59,659 --> 01:50:01,620
Some may describe me as buffoonish,

2870
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:03,620
but I say poppycock to all that.

2871
01:50:03,620 --> 01:50:06,602
I am much sharper than most give me credit for.

2872
01:50:06,602 --> 01:50:09,703
I just don’t pay attention to things sometimes.

2873
01:50:09,703 --> 01:50:12,903
I’ve also been known to be rather cunning, loyal,

2874
01:50:12,903 --> 01:50:16,787
happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous.

2875
01:50:16,787 --> 01:50:20,071
I can’t help but show my true scales every now and then.

2876
01:50:20,071 --> 01:50:23,053
But overall, I think I’m quite friendly for a Dragonborn.

2877
01:50:24,984 --> 01:50:26,850
LIAM: Never entirely welcome in the company of

2878
01:50:26,850 --> 01:50:29,011
elves or men, Vax'ildan learned

2879
01:50:29,011 --> 01:50:32,133
at a young age to skip past formality,

2880
01:50:32,133 --> 01:50:35,483
preferring instead to invite himself in your door.

2881
01:50:35,483 --> 01:50:37,871
Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia,

2882
01:50:37,871 --> 01:50:40,447
Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven

2883
01:50:40,447 --> 01:50:43,395
royalty and human peasantry.

2884
01:50:43,395 --> 01:50:45,969
Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins

2885
01:50:45,969 --> 01:50:47,972
were eventually sent off to their father

2886
01:50:47,972 --> 01:50:50,102
in the elven capital of Singorn.

2887
01:50:50,102 --> 01:50:53,802
But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed,

2888
01:50:53,802 --> 01:50:56,229
and their time in the capital didn’t last.

2889
01:50:56,229 --> 01:50:59,253
The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on

2890
01:50:59,253 --> 01:51:00,713
the open road.

2891
01:51:00,713 --> 01:51:04,228
After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to

2892
01:51:04,228 --> 01:51:06,355
return to their mother, and journeyed

2893
01:51:06,355 --> 01:51:08,445
back to the lands of their youth.

2894
01:51:08,445 --> 01:51:11,061
But instead of finding their childhood home,

2895
01:51:11,061 --> 01:51:13,839
they returned to a pile of rubble.

2896
01:51:13,839 --> 01:51:17,597
Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash.

2897
01:51:17,597 --> 01:51:20,408
Pressing the townspeople for answers,

2898
01:51:20,408 --> 01:51:23,187
they learned of the day the dragon came.

2899
01:51:23,187 --> 01:51:26,121
(dragon roaring)

2900
01:51:26,121 --> 01:51:29,353
With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister

2901
01:51:29,353 --> 01:51:33,329
set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei.

2902
01:51:33,329 --> 01:51:37,135
An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life’s

2903
01:51:37,135 --> 01:51:40,544
challenges in his own particular way,

2904
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:43,178
often by sidestepping them entirely.

2905
01:51:43,178 --> 01:51:47,016
And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn’t enough,

2906
01:51:47,016 --> 01:51:48,556
(ringing weapons SFX)

2907
01:51:48,556 --> 01:51:51,214
the way of blades the elves schooled him in

2908
01:51:51,214 --> 01:51:53,156
more than makes up the difference.

2909
01:51:54,391 --> 01:51:56,197
LAURA: Like so many half-elves,

2910
01:51:56,197 --> 01:51:58,427
Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering

2911
01:51:58,427 --> 01:52:03,332
the cool reception of a people who don’t fully accept her.

2912
01:52:03,332 --> 01:52:07,411
Born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life

2913
01:52:07,411 --> 01:52:09,973
took an interest in their existence,

2914
01:52:09,973 --> 01:52:13,391
Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly

2915
01:52:13,391 --> 01:52:16,688
realized the only people they could truly rely on

2916
01:52:16,688 --> 01:52:19,784
in this world were each other.

2917
01:52:19,784 --> 01:52:23,342
It was at the age of 10 when the two were taken from their mother

2918
01:52:23,342 --> 01:52:25,279
and brought to live in Singorn,

2919
01:52:25,279 --> 01:52:29,312
the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador.

2920
01:52:29,312 --> 01:52:33,642
He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance,

2921
01:52:33,642 --> 01:52:36,446
and after too many years of disdainful looks,

2922
01:52:36,446 --> 01:52:40,018
the pair decided to leave his indifference behind,

2923
01:52:40,018 --> 01:52:42,247
and set out on their own.

2924
01:52:42,247 --> 01:52:46,153
Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and

2925
01:52:46,153 --> 01:52:48,206
learning the ways of the thief,

2926
01:52:48,206 --> 01:52:51,358
while Vex kept to the woods.

2927
01:52:51,358 --> 01:52:53,581
She preferred the isolation.

2928
01:52:53,581 --> 01:52:57,759
Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track,

2929
01:52:57,759 --> 01:53:00,208
to spy and to shoot.

2930
01:53:00,208 --> 01:53:02,552
And through a series of fateful events,

2931
01:53:02,552 --> 01:53:06,597
earned herself a companion in the form of a bear -

2932
01:53:06,597 --> 01:53:09,000
her own stolen Trinket -

2933
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:13,011
to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely.

2934
01:53:13,011 --> 01:53:17,662
Also he is adorable, and gives expert massages.

2935
01:53:19,795 --> 01:53:25,070
(drumming battle music)

2936
01:53:48,907 --> 01:53:54,059
(drumming battle music continues)

2937
01:54:27,204 --> 01:54:28,563
ORION: Still alive!

2938
01:54:28,563 --> 01:54:29,907
MATT: (laughs) Welcome back, guys.

2939
01:54:29,907 --> 01:54:31,936
Welcome back to Critical Role.

2940
01:54:31,936 --> 01:54:33,612
And we have Orion -- .

2941
01:54:33,612 --> 01:54:34,694
LIAM: Holy hell.

2942
01:54:34,694 --> 01:54:35,777
TALIESIN: Ow.

2943
01:54:35,777 --> 01:54:36,776
MARISHA: Are you okay?

2944
01:54:36,776 --> 01:54:37,698
TALIESIN: I'm fine.

2945
01:54:37,698 --> 01:54:39,445
MATT: 2d6 damage to Tiberius.

2946
01:54:39,445 --> 01:54:41,330
So, guys, for those who are keeping up:

2947
01:54:41,330 --> 01:54:42,813
two things, real fast.

2948
01:54:42,813 --> 01:54:47,280
We want to thank Jacqueline Lassiter for the 
awesome food she sent for us.

2949
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:49,558
ALL: (words of acclamation and thanks)

2950
01:54:49,558 --> 01:54:50,669
MATT: Seriously, thank you.

2951
01:54:50,669 --> 01:54:52,420
A delightful, necessary treat after this game time.

2952
01:54:52,420 --> 01:54:54,009
So, thank you, thank you, thank you.

2953
01:54:54,009 --> 01:54:58,199
Also for the 2,150-subscriber mark, we're giving away

2954
01:54:58,199 --> 01:55:00,587
this autographed photo of the cast.

2955
01:55:00,587 --> 01:55:01,994
LAURA: Autographed photo.

2956
01:55:01,994 --> 01:55:03,571
MATT: We'll send out to you.

2957
01:55:03,571 --> 01:55:04,913
LIAM: It's so handsome.

2958
01:55:04,913 --> 01:55:06,065
MARISHA: Who is it going to?

2959
01:55:06,065 --> 01:55:07,928
MATT: Some lucky person in the chatroom 
once we hit 2,150.

2960
01:55:07,928 --> 01:55:09,120
MARISHA: Oh. We don't know yet.

2961
01:55:09,120 --> 01:55:11,017
MATT: Whenever that happens, that will be going to you.

2962
01:55:11,017 --> 01:55:13,310
So, yes, returning to the game--

2963
01:55:13,310 --> 01:55:15,871
SAM: Also, we've got these t-shirts. You should want them.

2964
01:55:15,871 --> 01:55:17,680
(Laura and Marisha laugh)

2965
01:55:17,680 --> 01:55:19,143
MATT: We're going to now look into--

2966
01:55:19,143 --> 01:55:20,098
MARISHA: Yes, let us know if you want them.

2967
01:55:20,098 --> 01:55:21,053
LAURA: We're going to look into that.

2968
01:55:21,053 --> 01:55:22,144
MATT: We're going to look into possibly finding a way

2969
01:55:22,144 --> 01:55:23,818
to get these shirts to you guys in the next couple weeks.

2970
01:55:23,818 --> 01:55:24,974
MARISHA: Only if you want them, though.

2971
01:55:24,974 --> 01:55:26,743
This is going to be a lot of work.

2972
01:55:26,743 --> 01:55:28,706
We don't want to do it unless you really want them.

2973
01:55:28,706 --> 01:55:29,458
ORION: We hate doing work.

2974
01:55:29,458 --> 01:55:30,268
TRAVIS: We're voice actors.

2975
01:55:30,268 --> 01:55:31,270
TALIESIN: We're not here to work.

2976
01:55:31,270 --> 01:55:34,717
SAM: Where are we? We were just going in a door.

2977
01:55:34,717 --> 01:55:36,463
MATT: Indeed. You guys--

2978
01:55:36,463 --> 01:55:37,878
LIAM: Come on. Yes, they want them.

2979
01:55:37,878 --> 01:55:41,431
MATT: Cool. I guess that feedback is good.

2980
01:55:41,431 --> 01:55:45,515
The party had just managed to not-quite-so-stealthily

2981
01:55:45,515 --> 01:55:49,409
pry their way into the hidden entrance to the outside

2982
01:55:49,409 --> 01:55:52,081
of the duergar stronghold of Emberhold.

2983
01:55:52,081 --> 01:55:56,493
They found themselves crammed into a very tiny,

2984
01:55:56,493 --> 01:55:58,970
essentially a storage room,

2985
01:55:58,970 --> 01:56:02,111
with a stairway leading up and a closed doorway

2986
01:56:02,111 --> 01:56:04,453
leading further into the stronghold.

2987
01:56:04,453 --> 01:56:07,112
So, what is your preference?

2988
01:56:07,112 --> 01:56:10,087
LAURA: I think we should go through the door, 
instead of going up.

2989
01:56:10,087 --> 01:56:11,192
LIAM: I agree.

2990
01:56:11,192 --> 01:56:12,717
LAURA: Because any prisoners are probably

2991
01:56:12,717 --> 01:56:14,593
going to be kept at a low level.

2992
01:56:14,593 --> 01:56:16,579
TALIESIN: Can we quietly open the door?

2993
01:56:16,579 --> 01:56:18,044
MATT: Yeah, once inside.

2994
01:56:18,044 --> 01:56:20,057
LAURA: Can we very stealthily try to open -

2995
01:56:20,057 --> 01:56:21,857
oh, check for traps!

2996
01:56:21,857 --> 01:56:25,799
LIAM: Yes, I'm going to sniff the door a bit.

2997
01:56:25,799 --> 01:56:28,058
MATT: All right.

2998
01:56:28,058 --> 01:56:30,172
LAURA: (sniffing SFX)

2999
01:56:30,172 --> 01:56:31,374
LIAM: Yeah, that's a 20.

3000
01:56:31,374 --> 01:56:38,375
MATT: 20? Best you can tell, the door itself is locked,

3001
01:56:38,375 --> 01:56:40,349
but is not trapped.

3002
01:56:40,349 --> 01:56:42,644
LIAM: Okay, well - (clinking SFX)

3003
01:56:42,644 --> 01:56:44,375
Okay, thieves’ tools out.

3004
01:56:44,375 --> 01:56:45,768
Oh, that's an easy 30.

3005
01:56:45,768 --> 01:56:46,916
SAM: 30?!

3006
01:56:46,916 --> 01:56:48,018
MATT: A 30!

3007
01:56:48,018 --> 01:56:49,106
LIAM: 30.

3008
01:56:49,106 --> 01:56:50,356
SAM: Jesus.
MARISHA: God damn.

3009
01:56:50,356 --> 01:56:52,202
MATT: Which is good because it's a very, very intricate lock.

3010
01:56:52,202 --> 01:56:55,983
There is a specific key, a single key that 
is designed for this lock,

3011
01:56:55,983 --> 01:56:59,878
that you gather is probably held by King Murghol himself.

3012
01:56:59,878 --> 01:57:01,571
ASHLEY: King Myrtle?

3013
01:57:01,571 --> 01:57:03,010
LAURA: Mairgil. Mare - Mairgil?

3014
01:57:03,010 --> 01:57:04,010
MATT: Mur-ghol.

3015
01:57:04,010 --> 01:57:04,803
MARISHA: Marigold.

3016
01:57:04,803 --> 01:57:05,893
SEVERAL: Murghol.

3017
01:57:05,893 --> 01:57:07,560
SAM: And his queen, Durarara.

3018
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:09,454
MATT: (laughs)

3019
01:57:09,454 --> 01:57:12,339
MARISHA: Is that how you pronounce 
her name? Doo-gara-gar?

3020
01:57:12,339 --> 01:57:13,782
LIAM: It's, uh, Ermahgerd?

3021
01:57:13,782 --> 01:57:16,299
ALL: Ermahgerd.

3022
01:57:16,299 --> 01:57:17,533
LAURA: Ulara is her name.

3023
01:57:17,533 --> 01:57:18,565
ORION: Kuma.

3024
01:57:18,565 --> 01:57:19,592
LAURA: Queen Ulara.

3025
01:57:19,592 --> 01:57:20,471
SAM: Ulara. Uhura.

3026
01:57:20,471 --> 01:57:21,419
MATT: Yes. Uhura.

3027
01:57:21,419 --> 01:57:22,235
MARISHA: Uhura.

3028
01:57:22,235 --> 01:57:23,027
TALIESIN: Kana.

3029
01:57:23,027 --> 01:57:23,623
MATT: Kumar.

3030
01:57:23,623 --> 01:57:24,873
MARISHA: I don't know! What is her name?

3031
01:57:24,873 --> 01:57:25,750
Seriously, what is her name, now?

3032
01:57:25,750 --> 01:57:26,432
LAURA: It's Ulara! Ulara.

3033
01:57:26,432 --> 01:57:27,141
SAM: Ulara.

3034
01:57:27,141 --> 01:57:27,901
MARISHA: What is -- ?

3035
01:57:27,901 --> 01:57:28,571
SEVERAL: Ulara.

3036
01:57:28,571 --> 01:57:29,744
MARISHA: Ulara. (giggles)

3037
01:57:29,744 --> 01:57:30,601
MATT: Shh.

3038
01:57:30,601 --> 01:57:32,129
TALIESIN: Maybe not.

3039
01:57:32,129 --> 01:57:35,627
MARISHA: Uladra. Right?

3040
01:57:35,627 --> 01:57:37,210
LIAM: I'm picking a lock.

3041
01:57:37,210 --> 01:57:39,111
LAURA: Shh. He's picking a lock. Be very quiet.

3042
01:57:39,111 --> 01:57:40,261
LIAM: (clicking SFX)

3043
01:57:40,261 --> 01:57:42,693
MATT: However, you do manage to find a series

3044
01:57:42,693 --> 01:57:44,475
of intricate, strangely-constructed dwarven tumblers

3045
01:57:44,475 --> 01:57:48,118
on the inside that each have a very strange, 
rigid structure -- (laughs)

3046
01:57:48,118 --> 01:57:49,928
LIAM: ‘Ey!

3047
01:57:49,928 --> 01:57:52,091
MATT: Please do that every time you pick a lock.

3048
01:57:52,091 --> 01:57:54,176
You manage to get the right sequence,

3049
01:57:54,176 --> 01:57:56,910
and with a slight - (clicking SFX) - clicking sound,

3050
01:57:56,910 --> 01:58:00,113
(squeak SFX) the door opens slightly on the inside.

3051
01:58:00,113 --> 01:58:01,692
LAURA: Yes.

3052
01:58:01,692 --> 01:58:02,976
LIAM: It was pretty easy.

3053
01:58:02,976 --> 01:58:05,711
MATT: Leading into what you can see is a hallway,

3054
01:58:07,375 --> 01:58:12,055
that continues further down to about there.

3055
01:58:12,055 --> 01:58:13,628
LIAM: Where is the door?

3056
01:58:13,628 --> 01:58:15,127
Where is the door that I just picked?

3057
01:58:15,127 --> 01:58:16,217
MATT: The door that you picked, if you wanted

3058
01:58:16,217 --> 01:58:17,740
to walk through is right there.

3059
01:58:17,740 --> 01:58:18,882
LIAM: It's naturally there.

3060
01:58:18,882 --> 01:58:21,614
LAURA: So that other stuff is upstairs.

3061
01:58:22,918 --> 01:58:24,510
MATT: All of this is on the floor that you're on.

3062
01:58:24,510 --> 01:58:26,420
LAURA: Oh! Okay.

3063
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:32,008
LIAM: I'm going to take six or seven 
quiet steps forward, stealthily.

3064
01:58:35,170 --> 01:58:36,673
19 stealth.

3065
01:58:36,673 --> 01:58:37,888
MATT: All right.

3066
01:58:37,888 --> 01:58:42,571
ORION: As he does this, I'm going to pull out my Ioun stone

3067
01:58:42,571 --> 01:58:44,566
from my pouch, and let it-- (whirling SFX)

3068
01:58:44,566 --> 01:58:45,877
MATT: All right, cool.

3069
01:58:45,877 --> 01:58:47,062
TRAVIS: We're all trapped in that room together, right?

3070
01:58:47,062 --> 01:58:47,973
MATT: You are. Correct.

3071
01:58:47,973 --> 01:58:49,162
TRAVIS: I fart.

3072
01:58:49,162 --> 01:58:50,533
(all laugh)

3073
01:58:50,533 --> 01:58:53,721
ORION: Oh! Grog! Prestidigitation, and I (whoosh SFX)

3074
01:58:53,721 --> 01:58:55,273
make a quick wind-gust--

3075
01:58:55,273 --> 01:58:56,276
MATT: Okay.

3076
01:58:56,276 --> 01:58:57,685
LIAM: Just circulate it around the room, will you?

3077
01:58:57,685 --> 01:58:58,843
ORION: I blew it away!

3078
01:58:58,843 --> 01:59:01,672
I could blow it right up your nose, Vax! (fluttering SFX)

3079
01:59:01,672 --> 01:59:03,945
TRAVIS: I'm closer to you now than I've ever been before.

3080
01:59:03,945 --> 01:59:05,305
LAURA: I throw up in my mouth just a little bit.

3081
01:59:05,305 --> 01:59:06,478
TALIESIN: Go around the corner and tell us what you see.

3082
01:59:06,478 --> 01:59:07,288
MATT: Just a little bit.

3083
01:59:07,288 --> 01:59:08,339
ORION: Oh. I'm sorry.

3084
01:59:08,339 --> 01:59:09,154
MATT: (laughs)

3085
01:59:09,154 --> 01:59:10,525
TALIESIN: Take a very quiet peek around the corner.

3086
01:59:10,525 --> 01:59:12,053
LIAM: All right, I'm having a peeky-poo.

3087
01:59:12,053 --> 01:59:13,177
TALIESIN: Quietly.

3088
01:59:13,177 --> 01:59:16,916
MATT: As you peek through, you can get a general idea

3089
01:59:16,916 --> 01:59:26,424
of what looks to be some sort of an empty storage room.

3090
01:59:26,424 --> 01:59:28,720
A lot of materials have been moved out of it.

3091
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:31,748
It looks like the remnants of stone,

3092
01:59:31,748 --> 01:59:33,889
things that were used for construction that once were

3093
01:59:33,889 --> 01:59:35,699
in this room that have been pulled out to build things.

3094
01:59:35,699 --> 01:59:37,545
Possibly moved as part of the war camp to start building

3095
01:59:37,545 --> 01:59:40,708
some of the siege weapons that you saw above.

3096
01:59:40,708 --> 01:59:43,027
LIAM: Do I hear anything?

3097
01:59:43,027 --> 01:59:45,119
MATT: Not currently. Roll a perception check.

3098
01:59:45,119 --> 01:59:47,325
LIAM: Yes.

3099
01:59:47,325 --> 01:59:49,015
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

3100
01:59:49,015 --> 01:59:50,823
LIAM: That's pretty good. 27.

3101
01:59:50,823 --> 01:59:53,967
MATT: Listening, you hear footsteps above.

3102
01:59:53,967 --> 01:59:57,018
You hear very, very faintly through the stonework about

3103
01:59:57,018 --> 02:00:00,652
20 feet above you - (thumping SFX) -

3104
02:00:00,682 --> 02:00:03,147
some footsteps moving above.

3105
02:00:03,147 --> 02:00:06,821
Apparently there is some level of alert on the second floor.

3106
02:00:06,821 --> 02:00:08,883
LAURA: Oh, shit. We should move fast.

3107
02:00:08,883 --> 02:00:09,970
MARISHA: Hmm. I wonder why.

3108
02:00:09,970 --> 02:00:10,855
LIAM: Go figure.

3109
02:00:10,855 --> 02:00:11,724
LAURA: We should get out of the room.

3110
02:00:11,724 --> 02:00:12,710
ORION: Yes, Percy, I wonder why.

3111
02:00:12,710 --> 02:00:13,792
LAURA: We start getting out of the room.

3112
02:00:13,792 --> 02:00:15,569
TALIESIN: It’s a wonder, looking outside.

3113
02:00:15,569 --> 02:00:17,039
LIAM: I go back to the door and just be like--

3114
02:00:17,039 --> 02:00:18,579
LAURA: (whispering) Come on. Hurry!

3115
02:00:18,579 --> 02:00:22,543
LIAM: So, I want to go further - no 
doorway, as of yet. Correct?

3116
02:00:22,543 --> 02:00:23,813
MATT: No doorway here.

3117
02:00:23,813 --> 02:00:24,867
LIAM: If I go this way--

3118
02:00:24,867 --> 02:00:26,371
LAURA: They're going to start coming down 
these fricking stairs in this room.

3119
02:00:26,371 --> 02:00:28,061
MATT: This way? It ends. The hallway 
comes to an end, with a wall.

3120
02:00:28,061 --> 02:00:30,868
LIAM: Well then, I'm going to peek into 
this door here. This open door.

3121
02:00:30,868 --> 02:00:32,064
MATT: Here?

3122
02:00:32,064 --> 02:00:33,830
LIAM: No. What's right by the figure?

3123
02:00:33,830 --> 02:00:35,626
MATT: This is the one you just looked into that had 
this empty room that--

3124
02:00:35,626 --> 02:00:37,808
LIAM: Thank you, thank you. So, down the one hall.

3125
02:00:37,808 --> 02:00:39,938
MATT: Down the one hall.

3126
02:00:39,938 --> 02:00:42,273
Look past here there is a stairway that descends downward.

3127
02:00:42,273 --> 02:00:43,779
LIAM: Down.

3128
02:00:43,779 --> 02:00:45,719
MATT: Looking down - pardon me.

3129
02:00:49,980 --> 02:00:54,635
Looking down this hallway, you see what resembles -

3130
02:00:54,635 --> 02:00:57,476
there's a door to your left that's closed currently,

3131
02:00:57,476 --> 02:00:59,815
and it splits off into two directions, right and left.

3132
02:00:59,815 --> 02:01:01,248
LIAM: Right, I don't even tell anyone.

3133
02:01:01,248 --> 02:01:02,989
I just start to slink down the steps.

3134
02:01:02,989 --> 02:01:04,026
MATT: Okay.

3135
02:01:04,026 --> 02:01:05,206
LAURA: Did he go down?

3136
02:01:05,206 --> 02:01:06,477
LIAM: Yes.

3137
02:01:06,477 --> 02:01:07,693
LAURA: Oh, geez Louise.

3138
02:01:07,693 --> 02:01:09,441
MATT: Okay.

3139
02:01:11,988 --> 02:01:14,026
Put Clarota there.

3140
02:01:15,828 --> 02:01:18,009
You continue down the stairway, and as you 
slowly move around,

3141
02:01:18,009 --> 02:01:19,935
you can see down towards the bottom

3142
02:01:19,935 --> 02:01:24,068
a very faint bit of reddish glow-stone light

3143
02:01:24,068 --> 02:01:26,029
and a hallway that splits right and left.

3144
02:01:26,029 --> 02:01:27,620
Laura: (whispering) We should go downstairs.

3145
02:01:27,620 --> 02:01:29,170
LIAM: Right and left? I go to the right.

3146
02:01:29,170 --> 02:01:30,264
MATT: Okay.

3147
02:01:30,264 --> 02:01:31,668
TRAVIS: Why don’t we just go left?

3148
02:01:31,668 --> 02:01:32,793
LAURA: We're getting bored.

3149
02:01:32,793 --> 02:01:33,810
MATT: As you look past the right - you guys

3150
02:01:33,810 --> 02:01:34,734
are all waiting in the room?

3151
02:01:34,734 --> 02:01:35,467
LIAM: You should just storm in.

3152
02:01:35,467 --> 02:01:36,137
LAURA: I get out.

3153
02:01:36,137 --> 02:01:37,050
LIAM: Start banging your weapons together.

3154
02:01:37,050 --> 02:01:38,566
LAURA: No! I come out, because you're taking too long.

3155
02:01:38,566 --> 02:01:39,421
MARISHA: (laughs)

3156
02:01:39,421 --> 02:01:40,311
MATT: Anyone else?

3157
02:01:40,311 --> 02:01:41,321
ORION: I saunter about.

3158
02:01:41,321 --> 02:01:43,025
(all laugh)

3159
02:01:43,025 --> 02:01:44,469
ASHLEY: I'll head on out there.

3160
02:01:44,469 --> 02:01:45,897
SAM: I go where Pike goes.

3161
02:01:45,897 --> 02:01:48,000
MARISHA: We're just losing all attention span?

3162
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,098
Is that what's going on? We're just wandering off.

3163
02:01:50,098 --> 02:01:50,977
LAURA: No no no.

3164
02:01:50,977 --> 02:01:52,658
I said we stay in the area, but I wanted to check

3165
02:01:52,658 --> 02:01:54,517
on my brother because I feel like he's taking awhile.

3166
02:01:54,517 --> 02:01:55,567
MATT: All right.

3167
02:01:55,567 --> 02:01:57,940
LAURA: And he was just gonna check the doors.

3168
02:01:57,940 --> 02:02:00,864
MATT: As you move and glance over, you can see

3169
02:02:00,864 --> 02:02:04,805
there are two duergar stationed on each 
side of the split hallways.

3170
02:02:04,805 --> 02:02:07,976
One is a closed doorway to your right, and to the left

3171
02:02:07,976 --> 02:02:11,091
there's an open doorway that leads into a room.

3172
02:02:11,091 --> 02:02:13,017
LIAM: And that's when I went to the right?

3173
02:02:13,017 --> 02:02:15,503
MATT: Well, as soon as you went into where the division was,

3174
02:02:15,503 --> 02:02:17,795
you turned to the right and there were duergar there,

3175
02:02:17,795 --> 02:02:19,325
and a duergar on the left.

3176
02:02:19,325 --> 02:02:21,526
LIAM: I'm going to turn my chin over to the left,

3177
02:02:21,526 --> 02:02:22,797
and see what I see down there.

3178
02:02:22,797 --> 02:02:24,318
MATT: There's a second duergar that is currently

3179
02:02:24,318 --> 02:02:27,219
sitting in armor, weapon to its side.

3180
02:02:27,219 --> 02:02:28,801
Just occasionally glancing in.

3181
02:02:28,801 --> 02:02:30,805
You can hear, every now and then,

3182
02:02:30,805 --> 02:02:35,998
sounds like a moan or a slight whispering gurgle,

3183
02:02:35,998 --> 02:02:37,712
and the duergar will lean in -

3184
02:02:37,712 --> 02:02:40,035
“Hey, shut up in there! 'Kay?!”

3185
02:02:40,035 --> 02:02:43,330
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to go kill this guy.

3186
02:02:43,330 --> 02:02:44,828
LAURA: You don't want to tell us what you found?

3187
02:02:44,828 --> 02:02:46,119
ORION: As I notice him going up, I'm going to -

3188
02:02:46,119 --> 02:02:48,715
(click) Vax, what are you doing?

3189
02:02:48,715 --> 02:02:51,642
LIAM: (softly) Uh, I'm killing someone. Hold, please.

3190
02:02:51,642 --> 02:02:53,879
(all laughing)

3191
02:02:53,879 --> 02:02:56,336
SAM: (humming a Muzak version of "The Girl from Ipanema")

3192
02:02:56,336 --> 02:02:57,889
ORION: Uh, guys, Vax is going to go kill something.

3193
02:02:57,889 --> 02:02:59,935
MARISHA: It's okay. Let him do it by himself.

3194
02:02:59,935 --> 02:03:01,369
It's what he does best.

3195
02:03:01,369 --> 02:03:02,780
LIAM: I'm going to sneak up on this duergar.

3196
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:03,876
MATT: Make a stealth check.

3197
02:03:03,876 --> 02:03:05,064
ORION: I worry.

3198
02:03:05,064 --> 02:03:06,640
MARISHA: I know. It's okay.

3199
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:07,756
LIAM: 19?

3200
02:03:07,756 --> 02:03:10,814
MATT: 19? Let me go ahead and--

3201
02:03:10,814 --> 02:03:13,262
LAURA: Oh, no! Look at this.

3202
02:03:13,262 --> 02:03:14,991
MATT: This'll be an interesting--

3203
02:03:14,991 --> 02:03:16,792
LIAM: Like a magician, you just whip it out, Matt.

3204
02:03:16,792 --> 02:03:18,325
MATT: That's what I'm doing.

3205
02:03:18,325 --> 02:03:19,827
Trying, at least.

3206
02:03:19,827 --> 02:03:21,257
There we go.

3207
02:03:21,257 --> 02:03:22,984
TRAVIS: Do you want an extra hand?

3208
02:03:22,984 --> 02:03:24,969
TALIESIN: If Mr. Wizard can do it, you can do it.

3209
02:03:24,969 --> 02:03:26,566
SAM: Watch out!

3210
02:03:26,566 --> 02:03:28,028
LAURA It's that book.

3211
02:03:28,028 --> 02:03:29,936
MATT: Oh, it is the book, isn't it?

3212
02:03:29,936 --> 02:03:31,926
Stupid book.

3213
02:03:43,068 --> 02:03:49,164
As you've made your way here,

3214
02:03:50,922 --> 02:03:52,737
Vex [sic] you look to the right.

3215
02:03:52,737 --> 02:03:57,951
There's the duergar here to the left 
that's shouting into this room here.

3216
02:03:58,926 --> 02:04:00,230
SAM: Do something!

3217
02:04:00,230 --> 02:04:01,613
MATT: You missed entirely what I was telling you.

3218
02:04:01,613 --> 02:04:02,574
TRAVIS: Will you fucking do something, please?

3219
02:04:02,574 --> 02:04:03,879
LIAM: He's right there on the side.

3220
02:04:03,879 --> 02:04:05,954
There's one over there, there's one over there.

3221
02:04:05,954 --> 02:04:08,986
There's two. Oh, shit.

3222
02:04:12,617 --> 02:04:14,701
Well, we all come slamming down in here.

3223
02:04:14,701 --> 02:04:15,680
SAM: Yeah!

3224
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:17,179
TRAVIS: No, you're down there.

3225
02:04:17,179 --> 02:04:22,445
LIAM: So I sneak back up and I put 
a hand on my sister's shoulder,

3226
02:04:22,445 --> 02:04:25,604
and I give her a little come along motion.

3227
02:04:25,604 --> 02:04:28,217
And tell everyone else--

3228
02:04:28,217 --> 02:04:29,702
SAM: Don't you need some Grog?

3229
02:04:29,702 --> 02:04:33,809
LIAM: --I mouth "Kima" at everybody, 
and then pull my sister down.

3230
02:04:33,809 --> 02:04:35,513
MATT: As you're doing this, you hear footsteps

3231
02:04:35,513 --> 02:04:37,173
across the way echoing through the hallway,

3232
02:04:37,173 --> 02:04:39,936
what sounds like a number of other foot patters

3233
02:04:39,936 --> 02:04:41,109
heading through the halls--

3234
02:04:41,109 --> 02:04:42,468
LAURA: (gasps) We should just go down.

3235
02:04:42,468 --> 02:04:44,216
MATT: --towards the front of the stronghold.

3236
02:04:44,216 --> 02:04:46,150
LIAM: I'm just pulling Vex down.

3237
02:04:46,150 --> 02:04:48,664
ORION: The front? Oh, the front of the front.

3238
02:04:48,664 --> 02:04:50,287
Not where we're at, right?

3239
02:04:50,287 --> 02:04:53,449
MATT: Vex and Vax both disappear off to the side, down a hallway.

3240
02:04:53,449 --> 02:04:56,719
MARISHA: Before they leave I just tap their shoulders

3241
02:04:56,719 --> 02:05:00,363
and meditate and grant them Guidance.

3242
02:05:00,363 --> 02:05:01,593
MATT: Okay, you can give one of them

3243
02:05:01,593 --> 02:05:02,745
Guidance because it's concentration.

3244
02:05:02,745 --> 02:05:03,920
MARISHA: Uh, Vex.

3245
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:05,373
MATT: Okay.

3246
02:05:05,373 --> 02:05:06,235
LAURA: That's me.

3247
02:05:06,235 --> 02:05:07,097
MATT: Yes.

3248
02:05:07,097 --> 02:05:07,959
MARISHA: Fuck.

3249
02:05:07,959 --> 02:05:09,838
LAURA: Did you mean to give it to him?

3250
02:05:09,838 --> 02:05:11,233
MARISHA: Yes.

3251
02:05:11,233 --> 02:05:16,088
(everyone laughs)

3252
02:05:16,088 --> 02:05:17,116
ORION: Brava.

3253
02:05:17,116 --> 02:05:19,510
MATT: All right, who gets guidance?

3254
02:05:19,510 --> 02:05:21,900
SAM: The man one.

3255
02:05:21,900 --> 02:05:23,273
MATT: Vax.

3256
02:05:23,273 --> 02:05:24,540
MARISHA: Vax.

3257
02:05:24,540 --> 02:05:32,307
LIAM: So I pull my poison blade out and 
I pull the keen dagger out.

3258
02:05:32,307 --> 02:05:33,966
Okay, and I take the keen dagger -

3259
02:05:33,966 --> 02:05:35,367
so the one on the left is by the door and the one

3260
02:05:35,367 --> 02:05:36,614
that muttered through the doorway, right?

3261
02:05:36,614 --> 02:05:37,509
MATT: The one right here.

3262
02:05:37,509 --> 02:05:39,935
LIAM: So I give a little fwip, toss in my hand

3263
02:05:39,935 --> 02:05:42,273
and throw it right at his neck.

3264
02:05:42,273 --> 02:05:45,008
LAURA: At the same time I reach out and I go (arrow SFX).

3265
02:05:45,008 --> 02:05:48,626
LIAM: And the other one, the poison one, toward the other.

3266
02:05:48,626 --> 02:05:50,327
MATT: Okay and you are?

3267
02:05:50,327 --> 02:05:51,861
LAURA: And I was going to shoot at the other one.

3268
02:05:51,861 --> 02:05:54,278
MATT: Go ahead and roll for this guy here.

3269
02:05:54,278 --> 02:05:57,865
LIAM: That guy.

3270
02:05:57,865 --> 02:06:00,865
That is a 17 for me.

3271
02:06:00,865 --> 02:06:02,286
MATT: 17 hits.

3272
02:06:02,286 --> 02:06:03,289
LAURA: 27.

3273
02:06:03,289 --> 02:06:04,384
MATT: 27, all right.

3274
02:06:04,384 --> 02:06:06,765
LIAM: And then on the other guy, or should 
I just go ahead and attack?

3275
02:06:06,765 --> 02:06:08,914
MATT: Go ahead and attack both.

3276
02:06:08,914 --> 02:06:10,552
LIAM: 17. So that’s--

3277
02:06:10,552 --> 02:06:11,949
LAURA: And 25 on the same.

3278
02:06:11,949 --> 02:06:14,066
MATT: Both arrows on the guy on the right?

3279
02:06:14,066 --> 02:06:15,579
LAURA: Let’s do both, one on each.

3280
02:06:15,579 --> 02:06:17,490
MATT: Each? (shooting SFX) You both - (impact SFX) - ?

3281
02:06:17,490 --> 02:06:18,390
LAURA: Yeah!

3282
02:06:18,390 --> 02:06:22,490
MATT: Okay, cool. Damage on the one on the left?

3283
02:06:22,490 --> 02:06:25,389
Which is sneak attack because he didn’t know you were there.

3284
02:06:28,391 --> 02:06:35,111
LIAM: So, 46 with the keen dagger on the guard at the door.

3285
02:06:35,111 --> 02:06:36,363
TALIESIN: Damn.

3286
02:06:36,363 --> 02:06:38,648
LAURA: So I was really useful!

3287
02:06:38,648 --> 02:06:41,056
MATT: The guy on the left, as he’s leaning back,

3288
02:06:41,056 --> 02:06:42,919
he’s getting angry with whoever is in that room.

3289
02:06:42,919 --> 02:06:44,887
As he turns back to take his post again,

3290
02:06:44,887 --> 02:06:49,023
(swoosh SFX) (gurgling) he just gurgles, 
slumps to the ground.

3291
02:06:49,023 --> 02:06:52,409
As he’s slumping, an arrow goes (impact sound)
into his stomach.

3292
02:06:52,409 --> 02:06:53,733
(everyone laughs)

3293
02:06:53,733 --> 02:06:55,608
LIAM: It’s like a punctuation.

3294
02:06:55,608 --> 02:06:57,206
LAURA &amp; MATT: Yeah.

3295
02:06:57,206 --> 02:06:59,327
MATT: Roll damage for the second attack.

3296
02:06:59,327 --> 02:07:00,975
LIAM: The poison dagger goes (thunk sound).

3297
02:07:00,975 --> 02:07:02,223
Well, I didn’t roll to hit him.

3298
02:07:02,223 --> 02:07:03,275
MATT: And you are using the poison effect on him?

3299
02:07:03,275 --> 02:07:04,411
LIAM: Yes.

3300
02:07:04,411 --> 02:07:05,580
LAURA: 15 on the other guy for me.

3301
02:07:05,580 --> 02:07:07,327
LIAM: That is a 19.

3302
02:07:07,327 --> 02:07:09,708
MATT: Okay, that hits. Now roll damage.

3303
02:07:09,708 --> 02:07:11,864
LIAM: This doesn’t get sneak attack?

3304
02:07:11,864 --> 02:07:12,948
MATT: No.

3305
02:07:12,948 --> 02:07:14,834
LIAM: Because I already used that.

3306
02:07:14,834 --> 02:07:17,610
I made some noise hitting the first guy.

3307
02:07:17,610 --> 02:07:20,469
7 plus the poison.

3308
02:07:20,469 --> 02:07:23,336
MATT: What is the poison damage?

3309
02:07:23,336 --> 02:07:26,369
LIAM: The poison is DC 15.

3310
02:07:26,369 --> 02:07:29,287
MATT: He does not make the save, 
even though he’s a duergar.

3311
02:07:29,287 --> 02:07:31,990
LAURA: I go running back up since 
I’ve already shot my arrows.

3312
02:07:31,990 --> 02:07:33,344
MATT: Let me check one thing real fast.

3313
02:07:33,344 --> 02:07:34,822
LAURA: And I figured you’ve got this.

3314
02:07:34,822 --> 02:07:36,654
MATT: Check one thing.

3315
02:07:36,654 --> 02:07:39,154
ASHLEY: He could just clear this whole place by himself.

3316
02:07:39,154 --> 02:07:40,493
LIAM: 9 points of poison on him.

3317
02:07:40,493 --> 02:07:45,239
MATT: Okay. So, an arrow (impact SFX) into his chest

3318
02:07:45,239 --> 02:07:48,006
just as the poison blade makes contact.

3319
02:07:48,006 --> 02:07:51,683
You can see him (gurgling SFX) double over for a second,

3320
02:07:51,683 --> 02:07:55,189
but the hardy duergar once-dwarven form

3321
02:07:55,189 --> 02:07:57,956
seems to shrug off a lot of the poison’s impact.

3322
02:07:57,956 --> 02:07:59,316
LAURA: Oh, shit!

3323
02:07:59,316 --> 02:08:02,529
MATT: He is still dribbling a very heavy 
amount of deep crimson

3324
02:08:02,529 --> 02:08:05,236
from his mouth, but he still (gasps) looks over

3325
02:08:05,236 --> 02:08:07,279
and sees you both in the hallway

3326
02:08:07,279 --> 02:08:10,069
and goes to reach for his warhammer

3327
02:08:10,069 --> 02:08:11,859
and turn around towards the door behind him.

3328
02:08:11,859 --> 02:08:15,316
LAURA: Can I throw an arrow at him?

3329
02:08:15,316 --> 02:08:16,817
LIAM: Do we roll for initiative at this point?

3330
02:08:16,817 --> 02:08:18,962
MATT: You guys roll for initiative to see who goes first.

3331
02:08:20,476 --> 02:08:22,439
SAM: I turn to Pike and say,

3332
02:08:22,439 --> 02:08:25,153
“What the fuck is going on? Where are they?”

3333
02:08:25,153 --> 02:08:26,972
ORION: I don’t know, but this book, Scanlan, is incredible.

3334
02:08:26,972 --> 02:08:28,158
SAM: I’m sure it is.

3335
02:08:28,158 --> 02:08:30,052
ORION: It’s all about this, er, an ice thing--

3336
02:08:30,052 --> 02:08:31,278
SAM: I read non-fiction.

3337
02:08:31,278 --> 02:08:32,658
ORION: --and these other things.

3338
02:08:32,658 --> 02:08:33,729
ASHLEY: Let’s head down there. I’m going 
to head down there.

3339
02:08:33,729 --> 02:08:34,574
LIAM: Careful, clanky.

3340
02:08:34,574 --> 02:08:35,496
ASHLEY: Oh.

3341
02:08:35,496 --> 02:08:37,573
MATT: So the rest of you are heading down there?

3342
02:08:37,573 --> 02:08:38,912
TRAVIS: I follow Pike down there.

3343
02:08:38,912 --> 02:08:40,055
SAM: I’m going, too.

3344
02:08:40,055 --> 02:08:41,160
LAURA: There are so many prisoners down this way.

3345
02:08:41,160 --> 02:08:42,098
MATT: Everyone else roll stealth checks.

3346
02:08:42,098 --> 02:08:43,154
LAURA: Everybody fucking come down.

3347
02:08:43,154 --> 02:08:43,883
MARISHA: Are we going down?

3348
02:08:43,883 --> 02:08:45,154
MATT: Stealth checks everyone.

3349
02:08:45,154 --> 02:08:46,230
You guys both beat him on initiative.

3350
02:08:46,230 --> 02:08:46,968
LAURA: Yes.

3351
02:08:46,968 --> 02:08:51,241
MATT: Roll attacks, both of you, just roll the dice.

3352
02:08:51,241 --> 02:08:52,352
SAM: Roll the dice.

3353
02:08:52,352 --> 02:08:53,563
ORION: Roll the dice.

3354
02:08:53,563 --> 02:08:54,873
ASHLEY: 19.

3355
02:08:54,873 --> 02:08:55,886
LIAM: 28.

3356
02:08:55,886 --> 02:08:57,351
ASHLEY: Getting a handle on my armor.

3357
02:08:57,351 --> 02:08:58,266
MATT: Okay. You don’t need to roll damage.

3358
02:08:58,266 --> 02:08:59,103
He has like, 2 hit points left.

3359
02:08:59,103 --> 02:09:01,174
You guys pepper him with additional arrows and daggers.

3360
02:09:01,174 --> 02:09:02,662
The poor guys is like:

3361
02:09:02,662 --> 02:09:04,730
“Uh, I’m gonna--” (impact SFX, gurgle)

3362
02:09:04,730 --> 02:09:07,568
He just goes down with this horrible sense of overkill,

3363
02:09:07,568 --> 02:09:10,261
his body just slumps up against the door,

3364
02:09:10,261 --> 02:09:14,298
leaning against the wooden door he was guarding.

3365
02:09:14,298 --> 02:09:15,586
LAURA: I say on my earring:

3366
02:09:15,586 --> 02:09:17,342
“I think we found the prison cells. Get down here.”

3367
02:09:17,342 --> 02:09:18,533
SAM: We’re coming.

3368
02:09:18,533 --> 02:09:19,673
ORION: I’m assuming they’re dead.

3369
02:09:19,673 --> 02:09:21,011
MATT: Both duergar.

3370
02:09:21,011 --> 02:09:22,178
LIAM: I start to loot the bodies.

3371
02:09:22,178 --> 02:09:23,082
MATT: Stealth checks?

3372
02:09:23,082 --> 02:09:23,725
ORION: 16.

3373
02:09:23,725 --> 02:09:24,360
MARISHA: 17.

3374
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:25,019
TALIESIN: 12.

3375
02:09:25,019 --> 02:09:25,631
SAM: 12.

3376
02:09:25,631 --> 02:09:26,391
TRAVIS: 20.

3377
02:09:26,391 --> 02:09:27,890
ASHLEY: 19.

3378
02:09:27,890 --> 02:09:29,883
MATT: All right, go team!

3379
02:09:29,883 --> 02:09:32,457
MARISHA: Woo! We’re stealthy bastards.

3380
02:09:32,457 --> 02:09:35,267
MATT: That was with disadvantage?

3381
02:09:35,267 --> 02:09:36,496
ASHLEY: I have to roll again?

3382
02:09:36,496 --> 02:09:37,489
LIAM: Yes.

3383
02:09:37,489 --> 02:09:38,322
LAURA: Why?

3384
02:09:38,322 --> 02:09:39,596
MATT: Because you’re in heavy plate armor.

3385
02:09:39,596 --> 02:09:40,748
MARISH &amp; LAURA: No!

3386
02:09:40,748 --> 02:09:43,234
ALL: (words of encouragement)

3387
02:09:46,684 --> 02:09:48,685
ASHLEY: (laughs)

3388
02:09:48,685 --> 02:09:50,265
LAURA: That’s not bad, that’s still not bad.

3389
02:09:50,265 --> 02:09:51,942
ASHLEY: I rolled an 8.

3390
02:09:51,942 --> 02:09:52,665
MATT: Okay.

3391
02:09:52,665 --> 02:09:53,488
LAURA: Plus what?

3392
02:09:53,488 --> 02:09:54,388
ASHLEY: Plus nothing.

3393
02:09:54,388 --> 02:09:55,769
(all laugh)

3394
02:09:55,769 --> 02:09:57,588
MATT: Okay.

3395
02:09:57,588 --> 02:10:00,560
LIAM: (clanking SFX)

3396
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:04,665
MATT: You guys, all rush down the stairs (stomping SFX)

3397
02:10:04,665 --> 02:10:06,461
the clanking of the plate armor as you're going down.

3398
02:10:06,461 --> 02:10:09,535
The rest of you wince as you notice it,

3399
02:10:09,535 --> 02:10:12,256
but you make it down anyway.

3400
02:10:12,256 --> 02:10:13,437
ASHLEY: (laughing) Oh my God.

3401
02:10:13,437 --> 02:10:14,535
TRAVIS: I should have picked you up.

3402
02:10:14,535 --> 02:10:16,096
MARISHA: I'm actually going to go ahead and throw Guidance

3403
02:10:16,096 --> 02:10:17,121
on Pike now.

3404
02:10:17,121 --> 02:10:18,280
SAM: Little late, little late.

3405
02:10:18,280 --> 02:10:19,883
TALIESIN: What does Guidance do?

3406
02:10:19,883 --> 02:10:22,973
MARISHA: It gives you a plus on your ability checks.

3407
02:10:22,973 --> 02:10:26,501
And it gives you a 1d4 plus to your--

3408
02:10:26,501 --> 02:10:27,979
(several talking at once)

3409
02:10:27,979 --> 02:10:29,404
SAM: Do they already knew [sic] we were here?

3410
02:10:29,404 --> 02:10:30,403
Now they really know.

3411
02:10:30,403 --> 02:10:34,781
MATT: So, the rest of you have made it down.

3412
02:10:34,781 --> 02:10:37,051
LIAM: Surprise!

3413
02:10:37,051 --> 02:10:38,505
MATT: In this hallway, there are 2 dead 
duergar on the ground.

3414
02:10:38,505 --> 02:10:40,250
One with a closed door and one with an open door.

3415
02:10:40,250 --> 02:10:43,682
LAURA: Well, let's go look in the 
open door. Stealthily.

3416
02:10:43,682 --> 02:10:45,212
MATT: You glance over into the open door,

3417
02:10:45,212 --> 02:10:48,758
you can see what appears to be a series of dungeon cells

3418
02:10:48,758 --> 02:10:52,498
held underneath the stronghold.

3419
02:10:52,498 --> 02:10:54,350
LIAM: Lady Kima?

3420
02:10:54,350 --> 02:10:56,713
MATT: Within these, you can see there are a number

3421
02:10:56,713 --> 02:11:00,612
of dwarven captives that are in very, very, very poor health--

3422
02:11:00,612 --> 02:11:01,935
TALIESIN: I don't care about them.

3423
02:11:01,935 --> 02:11:03,470
LAURA: We need to get them awake.

3424
02:11:03,470 --> 02:11:05,366
MATT: --that are currently lying down, unfed, gaunt.

3425
02:11:05,366 --> 02:11:06,472
SAM: Are any of them Lady Kima?

3426
02:11:06,472 --> 02:11:07,672
Because if they're not, they're about to die.

3427
02:11:07,672 --> 02:11:09,220
LAURA: No, they're regular dwarves, they're good people.

3428
02:11:09,220 --> 02:11:11,198
ORION: I go inspect them and see what's going on.

3429
02:11:11,198 --> 02:11:12,372
MATT: Okay.

3430
02:11:12,372 --> 02:11:14,551
MARISHA: I'll go in with Tiberius.

3431
02:11:14,551 --> 02:11:17,135
MATT: Okay, you guys enter.

3432
02:11:17,135 --> 02:11:21,855
As you look around, there are a series of largely

3433
02:11:21,855 --> 02:11:24,274
decomposed bodies in a few of these cells.

3434
02:11:24,274 --> 02:11:26,122
They are people who've just been left to die.

3435
02:11:26,122 --> 02:11:27,345
LAURA: Oh no.

3436
02:11:27,345 --> 02:11:30,082
MATT: One, there are these kind of strange deep underground,

3437
02:11:30,082 --> 02:11:34,040
rat-like creatures that are feeding on one of them.

3438
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:36,892
One of the dwarves is just wheezing in pain (moaning).

3439
02:11:36,892 --> 02:11:39,671
You can see his stomach is a little distended.

3440
02:11:39,671 --> 02:11:42,212
The other one is either unconscious, asleep, or dead.

3441
02:11:42,212 --> 02:11:43,732
You can't tell.

3442
02:11:43,732 --> 02:11:48,373
ASHLEY: Can I do a Mass Cure on them?

3443
02:11:48,373 --> 02:11:49,676
MATT: You can if you'd like.

3444
02:11:49,676 --> 02:11:52,115
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll do that.

3445
02:11:52,115 --> 02:11:53,125
LIAM: Yes, I was about to say.

3446
02:11:53,125 --> 02:11:54,419
I'm going to go start inspecting the other door.

3447
02:11:54,419 --> 02:11:55,539
TALIESIN: I'll go with him.

3448
02:11:55,539 --> 02:11:56,947
LAURA: Why don't you unlock the prison cells here?

3449
02:11:56,947 --> 02:11:58,162
MARISHA: Yeah, can you unlock the prison cells?

3450
02:11:58,162 --> 02:11:58,970
LIAM: Oh, sorry.

3451
02:11:58,970 --> 02:12:01,762
LAURA: Can we go in? Can we talk to them?

3452
02:12:01,762 --> 02:12:04,857
MATT: If you guys want to.

3453
02:12:04,857 --> 02:12:06,685
So you go through. It's fairly simple

3454
02:12:06,685 --> 02:12:09,714
over time for you to unlock the cells 
if you'd like, the 2 that are in there.

3455
02:12:09,714 --> 02:12:16,392
There's a difference between healing magic and nutrition.

3456
02:12:16,392 --> 02:12:21,426
You make them feel physically better for the moment,

3457
02:12:21,426 --> 02:12:23,873
but their physical form itself is failing.

3458
02:12:23,873 --> 02:12:27,215
TRAVIS: Just a thought, shouldn't we clear this mess 
before we let prisoners out?

3459
02:12:27,215 --> 02:12:28,788
MATT: They need food, they need air,

3460
02:12:28,788 --> 02:12:30,410
they need to be out of here soon.

3461
02:12:30,410 --> 02:12:31,613
They're both on the edge of death.

3462
02:12:31,613 --> 02:12:32,777
SAM: Put them in the bag of holding, Grog.

3463
02:12:32,777 --> 02:12:34,053
MARISHA: I pull out a water.

3464
02:12:34,053 --> 02:12:36,996
ORION: I go to the room, I take out my bottle of water..

3465
02:12:36,996 --> 02:12:39,931
MARISHA: I'll do the opposite one.

3466
02:12:39,931 --> 02:12:42,577
MATT: You guys hear heavy footsteps 
coming from the stairway

3467
02:12:42,577 --> 02:12:43,901
you guys just descended from.

3468
02:12:43,901 --> 02:12:46,932
TRAVIS: I go stand right next to the stairway.

3469
02:12:46,932 --> 02:12:48,557
MARISHA &amp; TALIESIN: In the cells, in the cells.

3470
02:12:48,557 --> 02:12:50,510
LIAM: I pull my sister and we flank.

3471
02:12:50,510 --> 02:12:52,290
I push her into flanking position to the door.

3472
02:12:52,290 --> 02:12:55,079
LAURA: Oh God, I nock an arrow, notch an arrow?

3473
02:12:55,079 --> 02:12:56,735
ORION: Where are they coming from?

3474
02:12:56,735 --> 02:12:59,840
LIAM: The stairs, from where we entered?

3475
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:01,963
MATT: What are you guys doing?

3476
02:13:01,963 --> 02:13:05,015
MARISHA: I jump in the cells and I pull

3477
02:13:05,015 --> 02:13:09,142
a dead, decomposing corpse over the top of me.

3478
02:13:09,142 --> 02:13:12,825
LAURA: Eww, Keyleth. All kinds of nastiness.

3479
02:13:12,825 --> 02:13:15,062
TALIESIN: I find a corner of a cell and slowly pull out my gun.

3480
02:13:15,062 --> 02:13:16,333
MARISHA: I’m going savage!

3481
02:13:16,333 --> 02:13:18,511
(all laugh)

3482
02:13:18,511 --> 02:13:21,253
TALIESIN: I should make sure all the 
doors are shut, not locked.

3483
02:13:21,253 --> 02:13:23,754
MATT: All right, all the doors are shut.

3484
02:13:23,754 --> 02:13:26,210
Pike, anything you doing?

3485
02:13:26,210 --> 02:13:28,678
ASHLEY: I'm just, you know, preparing.

3486
02:13:28,678 --> 02:13:30,093
MATT: (laughs) All right.

3487
02:13:30,093 --> 02:13:31,412
MARISHA: Just kicking it, just chilling.

3488
02:13:31,412 --> 02:13:33,643
LAURA: Do we need to move out of the way of the stairs?

3489
02:13:33,643 --> 02:13:35,375
LIAM: Vax is scooching Scanlan out of the way

3490
02:13:35,375 --> 02:13:37,230
to take that position right there.

3491
02:13:37,230 --> 02:13:39,227
TALIESIN: The bear is at the back cell.

3492
02:13:39,227 --> 02:13:40,692
LAURA: Scanlan, where are you?

3493
02:13:40,692 --> 02:13:42,994
SAM: There's voices coming from the stairs?

3494
02:13:42,994 --> 02:13:44,619
LIAM: Yeah, someone's coming.

3495
02:13:44,619 --> 02:13:45,779
SAM: But there's a bear in the stairs.

3496
02:13:45,779 --> 02:13:47,026
LAURA: Well, Trinket's coming down.

3497
02:13:47,026 --> 02:13:48,212
MARISHA: I call,

3498
02:13:48,212 --> 02:13:50,954
“Trinket, Trinket, Trinket (kissing SFX) Trinket!”

3499
02:13:50,954 --> 02:13:52,345
MATT: Trinket barely hears you from way over at the side.

3500
02:13:52,345 --> 02:13:53,702
MARISHA: (kissing SFX) Come on.

3501
02:13:53,702 --> 02:13:54,983
MATT: He's coming into this room.

3502
02:13:54,983 --> 02:13:59,905
Clarota just steps back, along the side 
of the stairs and out of view.

3503
02:14:02,195 --> 02:14:07,743
A few moments pass as the footsteps slowly trail off.

3504
02:14:09,945 --> 02:14:12,676
ORION: I leave and turn around where Vex and Vax are.

3505
02:14:12,676 --> 02:14:13,667
MARISHA: I know.

3506
02:14:13,667 --> 02:14:16,051
LAURA: What's in the other door?

3507
02:14:19,178 --> 02:14:22,824
MATT: The other door is currently locked 
from what you can tell.

3508
02:14:22,824 --> 02:14:25,079
LIAM: One moment.

3509
02:14:25,079 --> 02:14:27,359
It is now not locked, I think.

3510
02:14:27,359 --> 02:14:28,477
MATT: (chuckles)

3511
02:14:28,477 --> 02:14:29,870
LIAM: 25?

3512
02:14:29,870 --> 02:14:36,523
MATT: (clicking SFX) You push the door open 
and you see immediately,

3513
02:14:36,523 --> 02:14:43,073
the fast moving heft of some large blade towards your head.

3514
02:14:43,073 --> 02:14:44,778
SAM: Oh, snap!

3515
02:14:44,778 --> 02:14:45,944
LAURA: Oh, it's Kima.

3516
02:14:45,944 --> 02:14:47,742
LIAM: No, it's a trap ready to hit me.

3517
02:14:47,742 --> 02:14:50,536
MATT: That is 24 versus armor class.

3518
02:14:50,536 --> 02:14:51,668
LIAM: That hits.

3519
02:14:51,668 --> 02:14:53,137
MATT: That hits, all right.

3520
02:14:53,137 --> 02:14:54,618
LAURA: Oh, you didn't check for traps.
LIAM: Didn't check for traps.

3521
02:14:54,618 --> 02:14:55,771
TRAVIS: I thought you were good at this shit.

3522
02:14:55,771 --> 02:14:56,977
LIAM: I'm going to use uncanny dodge.

3523
02:14:56,977 --> 02:15:00,071
MATT: What would have been 20 points of 
slashing damage is reduced to 10.

3524
02:15:00,071 --> 02:15:03,411
So you take 10 damage as the axe (impact SFX)

3525
02:15:03,411 --> 02:15:06,335
hits you and imbeds itself in the wooden door, pulls back.

3526
02:15:06,335 --> 02:15:10,056
Now you see as a duergar wearing this nasty-looking

3527
02:15:10,056 --> 02:15:13,477
black leather tunic with a hood pulled back,

3528
02:15:13,477 --> 02:15:19,417
with a giant, gnarled, hefted greataxe,

3529
02:15:19,417 --> 02:15:22,108
words escaped me on that one,

3530
02:15:22,108 --> 02:15:24,009
has a bunch of scars on its face.

3531
02:15:24,009 --> 02:15:26,584
As it's grinning, it pulls the axe out of the doorway.

3532
02:15:26,584 --> 02:15:28,916
LIAM: Right, I spit on the ground, and yank my belt off

3533
02:15:28,916 --> 02:15:30,230
and throw it at his head.

3534
02:15:30,230 --> 02:15:31,591
LAURA: And I yell ‘hold.’

3535
02:15:31,591 --> 02:15:34,076
MATT: Okay. As you throw the belt--

3536
02:15:34,076 --> 02:15:35,451
SAM: Hold?

3537
02:15:35,451 --> 02:15:36,850
LAURA: Yeah, tell him to stop attacking.

3538
02:15:36,850 --> 02:15:37,985
LIAM: Yeah, serpent.

3539
02:15:37,985 --> 02:15:40,763
MATT: --he ducks out of the way,

3540
02:15:43,917 --> 02:15:46,799
pulls back out of the way, as the snake forms itself.

3541
02:15:46,799 --> 02:15:47,995
It goes ahead and makes its attack.

3542
02:15:47,995 --> 02:15:50,433
Go ahead and roll for snake attack against him.

3543
02:15:50,433 --> 02:15:52,098
SAM: Snake attack!

3544
02:15:52,098 --> 02:15:54,318
LIAM: Okay, 12 plus, I don't know what, 12.

3545
02:15:54,318 --> 02:15:55,802
Is my attack, his attack, snake attack?

3546
02:15:55,802 --> 02:15:56,699
MATT: Did you roll a 12 on that?

3547
02:15:56,699 --> 02:15:57,422
LIAM: Yeah.

3548
02:15:57,422 --> 02:15:58,986
MATT: Okay, that will not hit unfortunately.

3549
02:15:58,986 --> 02:15:59,808
LIAM: All right.

3550
02:15:59,808 --> 02:16:02,260
MATT: As he slaps it off himself and it (swish SFX)

3551
02:16:02,260 --> 02:16:03,711
cascades off to the side of the room.

3552
02:16:03,711 --> 02:16:05,004
ASHLEY: Is he in a cell?

3553
02:16:05,004 --> 02:16:07,561
TRAVIS: Is a base attack a straight line from him to Vax to--

3554
02:16:07,561 --> 02:16:08,857
SAM: He's protecting the cells.

3555
02:16:08,857 --> 02:16:10,184
ASHLEY: He's protecting the cells.

3556
02:16:10,184 --> 02:16:11,539
MATT: At which point he kicks the door closed again.

3557
02:16:11,539 --> 02:16:13,599
TRAVIS: Can I, in my rage, bullrush through this?

3558
02:16:13,599 --> 02:16:14,896
SAM: Yes, yes.

3559
02:16:14,896 --> 02:16:18,421
MATT: Now roll initiative, guys.

3560
02:16:18,423 --> 02:16:20,303
ORION: As he's going I immediately cast

3561
02:16:20,303 --> 02:16:22,220
Stone Skin on myself. (cracking SFX)

3562
02:16:22,220 --> 02:16:23,552
MATT: Okay.

3563
02:16:28,172 --> 02:16:30,978
LIAM: What I like is that there are 8 of us and 1 of him.

3564
02:16:30,978 --> 02:16:32,641
LAURA: Possibly, if no one else is behind that door.

3565
02:16:32,641 --> 02:16:33,630
TALIESIN: So far.

3566
02:16:33,630 --> 02:16:35,483
LAURA: He's in a room by himself.

3567
02:16:35,483 --> 02:16:37,565
LIAM: I can see the square, it's very small.

3568
02:16:39,366 --> 02:16:42,665
MATT: You've looked inside, seeing a brief bit of the room.

3569
02:16:42,665 --> 02:16:43,700
25 to 20?

3570
02:16:43,700 --> 02:16:44,571
TALIESIN: 26.

3571
02:16:44,571 --> 02:16:45,661
LIAM: 20.

3572
02:16:45,661 --> 02:16:47,077
MATT: 26, all right Percy.

3573
02:16:47,077 --> 02:16:49,728
LIAM: (shooting SFX)

3574
02:16:52,782 --> 02:16:54,382
MATT: All right. 20 to 15?

3575
02:16:54,382 --> 02:16:55,409
MARISHA: 18.

3576
02:16:55,409 --> 02:16:56,415
LAURA: 15.

3577
02:16:56,415 --> 02:16:57,665
ORION: 19.

3578
02:17:02,916 --> 02:17:04,532
MATT: 15 to 10?

3579
02:17:04,532 --> 02:17:05,945
TRAVIS: 14.

3580
02:17:05,945 --> 02:17:06,826
MATT: 14.

3581
02:17:07,877 --> 02:17:08,887
10 to 5?

3582
02:17:08,887 --> 02:17:09,885
ASHLEY: 7.

3583
02:17:12,219 --> 02:17:13,034
MATT: 5 to 1?

3584
02:17:13,034 --> 02:17:14,517
SAM: (nervously) 4.

3585
02:17:16,098 --> 02:17:17,522
MATT: All right. Percy, you're up first.

3586
02:17:17,522 --> 02:17:19,964
TALIESIN: Where am I?

3587
02:17:19,964 --> 02:17:21,539
MATT: You are way back in this cell, and you hear

3588
02:17:21,539 --> 02:17:25,177
a slam of broken wood and another slam of a door closing.

3589
02:17:25,177 --> 02:17:28,044
TALIESIN: I'm going to run to the hall.

3590
02:17:28,044 --> 02:17:29,711
MATT: Make an acrobatics check to try and move

3591
02:17:29,711 --> 02:17:31,341
through this cluster of people here.

3592
02:17:31,341 --> 02:17:32,725
TALIESIN: I can do that.

3593
02:17:34,385 --> 02:17:35,643
24.

3594
02:17:35,643 --> 02:17:39,312
MATT: 24. You leap over, vaulting off of Trinket,

3595
02:17:39,312 --> 02:17:41,520
land and move into this hallway.

3596
02:17:41,520 --> 02:17:43,122
And that's the extent of your movement.

3597
02:17:43,122 --> 02:17:47,332
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to try and take 
a shot and blow the lock.

3598
02:17:47,332 --> 02:17:49,474
MATT: Okay, with the Bad News or with your--?

3599
02:17:49,474 --> 02:17:50,597
TALIESIN: Oh no, Bad News is away.

3600
02:17:50,597 --> 02:17:52,562
This is just with the handheld,

3601
02:17:54,202 --> 02:17:56,172
shooting at the lock at the door.

3602
02:17:56,172 --> 02:17:57,744
MATT: Okay, go for it.

3603
02:17:59,358 --> 02:18:02,912
TALIESIN: Jesus H, 30.

3604
02:18:02,912 --> 02:18:04,971
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

3605
02:18:10,249 --> 02:18:11,806
TALIESIN: 9 points of damage.

3606
02:18:11,806 --> 02:18:13,222
MATT: 9 points of damage.

3607
02:18:13,222 --> 02:18:15,880
As the door slams back and you prepare yourself

3608
02:18:15,880 --> 02:18:19,087
to try and kick it open, you hear the familiar (zoom SFX)

3609
02:18:19,087 --> 02:18:20,772
of one of Percy's pepperbox bullets

3610
02:18:20,772 --> 02:18:23,137
as the actual handle of the door (impact SFX)

3611
02:18:23,137 --> 02:18:26,237
gets blown off and there's a small hole 
in the wooden door now

3612
02:18:26,237 --> 02:18:28,321
where its handle once was.

3613
02:18:28,321 --> 02:18:32,357
The door swings open a little bit 
loosely due to the impact.

3614
02:18:32,357 --> 02:18:34,056
That ends your turn.

3615
02:18:34,056 --> 02:18:35,285
TALIESIN: That ends my turn.

3616
02:18:35,285 --> 02:18:36,379
MATT: Vax, you're up.

3617
02:18:36,379 --> 02:18:38,717
LIAM: Okay. All I'm gonna do is grab the hole of the door

3618
02:18:38,717 --> 02:18:40,637
and yank it open and yell,

3619
02:18:40,637 --> 02:18:42,877
“Your turn, Grog!”

3620
02:18:42,877 --> 02:18:45,147
MARISHA: Oh! That's fun!

3621
02:18:47,205 --> 02:18:53,446
MATT: As you pull it open, the dwarf backs up

3622
02:18:53,446 --> 02:18:55,214
over what you can see now,

3623
02:18:55,214 --> 02:18:58,204
this room is completely covered in a series

3624
02:18:58,204 --> 02:19:02,746
of really nasty, hooked instruments.

3625
02:19:02,746 --> 02:19:06,506
Hot irons, you can see large pincers--

3626
02:19:06,506 --> 02:19:07,925
TRAVIS: (laughs excitedly)

3627
02:19:07,925 --> 02:19:09,341
MATT: --you can see various blades.

3628
02:19:09,341 --> 02:19:10,469
ASHLEY: Oh, it's like a torture chamber?

3629
02:19:10,469 --> 02:19:11,484
MATT: It's a torture chamber.

3630
02:19:11,484 --> 02:19:12,430
(all groan)

3631
02:19:12,430 --> 02:19:13,783
TRAVIS: It's Christmas!

3632
02:19:13,783 --> 02:19:15,203
TALIESIN: Grog is running into Toys R Us.

3633
02:19:15,203 --> 02:19:16,751
This is going to be great.

3634
02:19:16,751 --> 02:19:19,839
MATT: You see gently as he backs away

3635
02:19:19,839 --> 02:19:24,403
there is someone on this rack-like table.

3636
02:19:24,404 --> 02:19:27,910
The dwarf backs up with his axe getting ready.

3637
02:19:27,910 --> 02:19:29,491
LIAM: I use my bonus action to say,

3638
02:19:29,491 --> 02:19:31,644
“You are so fucked, dwarf.”

3639
02:19:31,644 --> 02:19:34,567
(all laugh)

3640
02:19:34,567 --> 02:19:37,506
MATT: All right, that brings us to Tiberius.

3641
02:19:37,506 --> 02:19:41,677
ORION: I like where this is going, Vax.

3642
02:19:41,677 --> 02:19:44,046
Wait, I go over there first and then I say that.

3643
02:19:44,046 --> 02:19:45,855
(all laugh)

3644
02:19:45,855 --> 02:19:46,949
MATT: Acrobatics check.

3645
02:19:46,949 --> 02:19:48,005
ORION: Acrobatics, why?

3646
02:19:48,005 --> 02:19:49,092
SAM: You gotta jump over people.

3647
02:19:49,092 --> 02:19:50,242
MATT: You've got to move through people.

3648
02:19:50,242 --> 02:19:51,633
The area is congested.

3649
02:19:51,633 --> 02:19:53,303
Small spaces, man.

3650
02:19:53,303 --> 02:19:54,935
Downside of a big party.

3651
02:19:54,935 --> 02:19:57,923
ORION: Okay. 22.

3652
02:19:57,923 --> 02:20:00,664
MATT: 22. You manage to move through, 
push the bear out of the way.

3653
02:20:00,664 --> 02:20:03,781
Move, Trinket. Get out the way!

3654
02:20:03,781 --> 02:20:05,079
ORION: (muttering) Bear!

3655
02:20:05,079 --> 02:20:06,813
MATT: You manage to make your way, 
squeeze past Percy.

3656
02:20:06,813 --> 02:20:08,680
ORION: The bear surprisingly smells really nice.

3657
02:20:08,680 --> 02:20:11,848
MATT: All right, Tiberius, what do 
you want to do now?

3658
02:20:11,848 --> 02:20:16,509
ORION: I'm going to follow suit as 
I see what Vax is doing.

3659
02:20:16,509 --> 02:20:18,735
I'm going to cast Hold Person on the dwarf.

3660
02:20:18,735 --> 02:20:20,560
MATT: You don't have visual on the 
dwarf currently, the dwarf is back--

3661
02:20:20,560 --> 02:20:22,135
ORION: What? That's absurd!

3662
02:20:22,135 --> 02:20:24,747
MATT: As you run through the hallway - 
which you don't know there's a dwarf there -

3663
02:20:24,747 --> 02:20:26,632
you rush out to the hallway after hearing 
all this commotion.

3664
02:20:26,632 --> 02:20:28,675
You look in and there's an open door into 
a room that's currently vacant.

3665
02:20:28,675 --> 02:20:31,460
You don't have enough movement to 
get close enough, unfortunately.

3666
02:20:31,460 --> 02:20:33,326
ORION: Oh well, poop.

3667
02:20:33,326 --> 02:20:35,913
I... I encourage violence.

3668
02:20:35,913 --> 02:20:38,310
(all laugh)

3669
02:20:38,310 --> 02:20:40,194
MATT: A wondrous use of an action.

3670
02:20:40,194 --> 02:20:43,249
ORION: Do it! Do it, Grog!

3671
02:20:43,249 --> 02:20:45,845
Destroy them!

3672
02:20:45,845 --> 02:20:47,304
With no regard to any of his existence.

3673
02:20:47,304 --> 02:20:48,928
MATT: Keyleth.

3674
02:20:48,928 --> 02:20:50,595
TRAVIS: (laughing) I encourage violence!

3675
02:20:50,595 --> 02:20:52,282
LIAM: That's the best line of the night! (laughs)

3676
02:20:57,041 --> 02:20:59,404
MATT: You are currently in a cell with

3677
02:20:59,404 --> 02:21:01,426
a dead body draped over you.

3678
02:21:01,426 --> 02:21:03,550
(all laughing)

3679
02:21:03,550 --> 02:21:05,475
MARISHA: It's cozy down here.

3680
02:21:05,475 --> 02:21:06,998
Okay, so with the dead body,

3681
02:21:06,998 --> 02:21:08,592
I hear what's going on -

3682
02:21:12,062 --> 02:21:14,216
we're roleplaying it up!

3683
02:21:14,216 --> 02:21:16,334
ORION: Get the body off of you.

3684
02:21:16,334 --> 02:21:18,670
MARISHA: I morph into Minxy form.

3685
02:21:18,670 --> 02:21:19,786
TRAVIS: Minxy!

3686
02:21:19,786 --> 02:21:21,566
MARISHA: And as I morph into Minxy form,

3687
02:21:21,566 --> 02:21:23,456
I take the dead body that's on top of me and

3688
02:21:23,456 --> 02:21:25,895
just pick it up with my mouth.

3689
02:21:28,225 --> 02:21:30,630
MATT: In your mouth, the body stirs.

3690
02:21:30,630 --> 02:21:32,757
It wasn't quite dead.

3691
02:21:32,757 --> 02:21:33,964
MARISHA: Oh, why?!

3692
02:21:33,964 --> 02:21:35,251
LAURA: (Gasps) Oh, Keyleth!

3693
02:21:35,251 --> 02:21:37,246
MARISHA: It was supposed to be - 
I wanted the dead one.

3694
02:21:37,246 --> 02:21:38,298
TRAVIS: Minxy says I'm sorry!

3695
02:21:38,298 --> 02:21:39,805
MARISHA: Can I drop that one and find a dead one?

3696
02:21:39,805 --> 02:21:41,274
MATT: Well, you wanted a dead one. It is now.

3697
02:21:41,274 --> 02:21:42,026
ALL: Oh!

3698
02:21:42,026 --> 02:21:43,631
MARISHA: That's fine, that's fine.

3699
02:21:43,631 --> 02:21:45,190
LIAM: Oh, murdering children again.

3700
02:21:45,190 --> 02:21:47,560
TALIESIN: Spend the entire game being the 
worst person in the world.

3701
02:21:47,560 --> 02:21:50,251
MARISHA: I know! I try so hard, you guys!

3702
02:21:50,251 --> 02:21:51,474
TRAVIS: Was it a child duergar?

3703
02:21:51,474 --> 02:21:54,830
MARISHA: I try so hard, I'm still the fucking worst!

3704
02:21:54,830 --> 02:21:59,857
MATT: So, you now have a dead, gaunt dwarf,

3705
02:21:59,857 --> 02:22:01,069
hanging from Minxy's mouth.

3706
02:22:01,069 --> 02:22:02,425
(all laugh)

3707
02:22:02,425 --> 02:22:04,986
MATT: What do you want to do?

3708
02:22:04,986 --> 02:22:06,378
SAM: Keep chewing.

3709
02:22:06,378 --> 02:22:08,943
MARISHA: Um, it was...

3710
02:22:08,943 --> 02:22:11,582
TRAVIS: Oh, go ahead, do something else.

3711
02:22:11,582 --> 02:22:14,079
TALIESIN: At least it's not gamey, it’s fresh.

3712
02:22:14,079 --> 02:22:18,701
MARISHA: Keyleth tries. Keyleth tries so hard.

3713
02:22:18,701 --> 02:22:20,385
ORION: You're not trying hard enough, damn it!

3714
02:22:20,385 --> 02:22:23,911
MARISHA: Fuck you man, all right? 
I'm having a tough day.

3715
02:22:23,911 --> 02:22:25,405
TRAVIS: You hear a little dwarf in the corner go:

3716
02:22:25,405 --> 02:22:26,189
"Mommy?"

3717
02:22:26,189 --> 02:22:27,743
MARISHA: Vex brought up the fact that I killed a kid.

3718
02:22:27,743 --> 02:22:30,553
I’m having all these memories coming back, I'm on the brink.

3719
02:22:30,553 --> 02:22:33,096
MATT: Yeah, there's some PTSD coming through.

3720
02:22:33,096 --> 02:22:36,592
MARISHA: So I've got this now-dead corpse in my mouth

3721
02:22:36,592 --> 02:22:39,679
and I come out around the corner.

3722
02:22:39,679 --> 02:22:41,274
MATT: Make an Acrobatics check.

3723
02:22:41,274 --> 02:22:42,673
Because you’re still moving through 
this clustered hallway

3724
02:22:42,673 --> 02:22:43,932
with a dead dwarf in your mouth.

3725
02:22:43,932 --> 02:22:44,884
LIAM: Holy cow!

3726
02:22:44,884 --> 02:22:46,522
MARISHA: I'm a tiger so--

3727
02:22:46,522 --> 02:22:49,493
LIAM: That was Greyspine's cousin.

3728
02:22:49,493 --> 02:22:51,726
MARISHA: Can I have an advantage?

3729
02:22:51,726 --> 02:22:54,619
Oh, I rolled a 15. Plus being a tiger?

3730
02:22:54,619 --> 02:22:58,683
MATT: You're fine. You manage to push through, 
you're leaping through.

3731
02:22:58,683 --> 02:23:01,213
MARISHA: I'm pouncy. And I come out into the hallway.

3732
02:23:01,213 --> 02:23:03,793
MATT: You actually shift Tiberius out of the way.

3733
02:23:03,793 --> 02:23:05,210
This is a very small space, you're a very big cat.

3734
02:23:05,210 --> 02:23:06,740
You're really pushing for space here.

3735
02:23:06,740 --> 02:23:08,136
MARISHA: Move!

3736
02:23:08,136 --> 02:23:11,143
MATT: It's very, very tight quarters for you, you're like - 
(struggling SFX)

3737
02:23:11,143 --> 02:23:14,263
ORION: Keyleth, as a cat, you smell less good as 
Trinket does.

3738
02:23:14,263 --> 02:23:16,074
MARISHA: It's not me, it's the dead body.

3739
02:23:16,074 --> 02:23:17,825
ORION: Oh. That's disgusting.

3740
02:23:17,825 --> 02:23:19,924
MARISHA: And I look at the dwarf.

3741
02:23:19,924 --> 02:23:21,295
MATT: You can't see him from your vantage point,

3742
02:23:21,295 --> 02:23:23,862
he's actually back out of sight.

3743
02:23:23,862 --> 02:23:25,319
ORION: I can't see him, you can't see him.

3744
02:23:25,319 --> 02:23:27,183
MARISHA: No? Can I shift to see him at all?

3745
02:23:27,183 --> 02:23:28,378
MATT: You don't know there's a dwarf there.

3746
02:23:28,378 --> 02:23:29,348
You just know there's some sort of commotion

3747
02:23:29,348 --> 02:23:30,568
going on. You move around the corner

3748
02:23:30,568 --> 02:23:31,407
and you see just an empty room.

3749
02:23:31,407 --> 02:23:32,394
LIAM: Everybody give up your turn to Grog.

3750
02:23:32,394 --> 02:23:33,421
LAURA: I know, let him go in the room.

3751
02:23:33,421 --> 02:23:34,373
ORION: Just let Grog deal with this butthole.

3752
02:23:34,373 --> 02:23:35,519
MARISHA: I look at Grog and I foam at the mouth

3753
02:23:35,519 --> 02:23:37,536
a little bit with the corpse and I--

3754
02:23:37,536 --> 02:23:38,398
SAM: Encourage violence.

3755
02:23:38,398 --> 02:23:39,607
MARISHA: --I encourage violence.

3756
02:23:39,607 --> 02:23:40,600
(all laugh)

3757
02:23:40,600 --> 02:23:43,706
MATT: All right. Vex?

3758
02:23:43,706 --> 02:23:45,008
MARISHA: Just gnawing on the dead dwarf.

3759
02:23:45,008 --> 02:23:46,718
LAURA: Oh, well, let's make this nice and easy.

3760
02:23:46,718 --> 02:23:48,430
I smack Grog on the ass and say,

3761
02:23:48,430 --> 02:23:49,538
"Go get him".

3762
02:23:49,538 --> 02:23:50,824
TRAVIS: (eager snarling)

3763
02:23:50,824 --> 02:23:51,835
MATT: All right, Grog, it's your turn.

3764
02:23:51,835 --> 02:23:53,441
TRAVIS: (eager snarling continues)

3765
02:23:53,441 --> 02:23:56,654
MARISHA: Does he get advantage because

3766
02:23:56,654 --> 02:23:58,667
we're all encouraging violence?

3767
02:23:58,667 --> 02:23:59,544
ORION: Yeah, or inspiration?

3768
02:23:59,544 --> 02:24:02,251
MATT: Oh no, you get inspiration dice for this whole set up.

3769
02:24:02,251 --> 02:24:03,610
1d8 inspiration dice.

3770
02:24:03,610 --> 02:24:04,836
SAM: You don't kill him in one shot,

3771
02:24:04,836 --> 02:24:06,596
it's very very disappointing.

3772
02:24:06,596 --> 02:24:07,925
MATT: All right, you run in.

3773
02:24:07,925 --> 02:24:09,140
TRAVIS: You said the room was full of shiny

3774
02:24:09,140 --> 02:24:10,369
pointy things on the wall, right?

3775
02:24:10,369 --> 02:24:11,085
MATT: Yes.

3776
02:24:11,085 --> 02:24:12,884
TRAVIS: I would like to bull rush the dwarf up

3777
02:24:12,884 --> 02:24:14,924
and against the wall, try and spear him

3778
02:24:14,924 --> 02:24:16,612
with all the sharp shit on the wall.

3779
02:24:16,612 --> 02:24:17,522
MATT: Okay!

3780
02:24:17,522 --> 02:24:18,986
ALL: (cheering)

3781
02:24:21,786 --> 02:24:27,969
MATT: Oh, that's nasty. Okay then, so for the-- (laughs)

3782
02:24:27,969 --> 02:24:30,098
LIAM: Instant karma's going to get you, man.

3783
02:24:30,098 --> 02:24:32,325
MATT: All right, so go ahead and make an athletics check.

3784
02:24:32,325 --> 02:24:33,783
LIAM: You hear that, Keyleth?

3785
02:24:33,783 --> 02:24:35,467
MARISHA: (growling)

3786
02:24:35,467 --> 02:24:37,186
TRAVIS: 24.

3787
02:24:37,186 --> 02:24:39,934
MATT: Yeah, against his 7.

3788
02:24:39,934 --> 02:24:44,701
You rush in and with your first attack, 
you grab him, lift him,

3789
02:24:44,701 --> 02:24:46,889
and you can see there's a series of giant meat hooks

3790
02:24:46,889 --> 02:24:48,319
hanging from the back of the wall,

3791
02:24:48,319 --> 02:24:50,560
and you just lift him up and (impaling SFX)

3792
02:24:50,560 --> 02:24:52,115
shove him down onto the hook which protrudes

3793
02:24:52,115 --> 02:24:54,678
from the front of his chest. (gurgling SFX)

3794
02:24:54,678 --> 02:24:58,838
TRAVIS: No, perfect. Tell me I get another attack.

3795
02:24:58,838 --> 02:25:00,029
MATT: You do.

3796
02:25:00,029 --> 02:25:01,490
TRAVIS: Excellent!

3797
02:25:01,490 --> 02:25:03,124
MATT: That's 12 points of damage and he's

3798
02:25:03,124 --> 02:25:07,317
currently restrained by the hook through his chest.

3799
02:25:07,317 --> 02:25:08,653
LAURA: Impaled? Oh!

3800
02:25:08,653 --> 02:25:10,293
TRAVIS: Perfect! With my second attack 
as he's screaming out

3801
02:25:10,293 --> 02:25:14,770
I reach inside, grab his lower jaw and 
pull him straight down.

3802
02:25:14,770 --> 02:25:16,400
MATT: Okay, make an attack roll.

3803
02:25:16,400 --> 02:25:19,532
LAURA: Oh no! That's so gross.

3804
02:25:19,532 --> 02:25:21,092
ASHLEY: Oh, I love this so much.

3805
02:25:21,092 --> 02:25:24,068
LIAM: Vax is using his free hand to cover his eyes.

3806
02:25:24,068 --> 02:25:25,864
SAM: Keyleth starts eating him.

3807
02:25:25,864 --> 02:25:27,252
TRAVIS: (laughing) 24.

3808
02:25:27,252 --> 02:25:29,547
MATT: (laughs) Go ahead and roll damage on this.

3809
02:25:29,547 --> 02:25:30,480
LAURA: Oh, sick.

3810
02:25:30,480 --> 02:25:31,883
TRAVIS: With a 12?

3811
02:25:31,883 --> 02:25:36,234
MATT: For flavor, roll a 12. Why not? 
You're pulling his jaw.

3812
02:25:36,234 --> 02:25:38,397
TRAVIS: Excellent! (laughing)

3813
02:25:38,397 --> 02:25:39,547
ASHLEY: He rolled really high.

3814
02:25:39,547 --> 02:25:40,928
TRAVIS: 15.

3815
02:25:40,928 --> 02:25:46,031
MATT: After you throw him onto the hook,

3816
02:25:46,031 --> 02:25:48,048
his axe clatters to the ground and he reaches up

3817
02:25:48,048 --> 02:25:50,197
with his hands to grab you and it looks like

3818
02:25:50,197 --> 02:25:52,352
he's pulling back to try and bring you in for a headbutt.

3819
02:25:52,352 --> 02:25:55,671
This angry look of burning rage in his white eyes,

3820
02:25:55,671 --> 02:25:59,121
this fucked-up duergar with all these scars on his face,

3821
02:25:59,121 --> 02:26:00,474
as he reaches up towards you,

3822
02:26:00,474 --> 02:26:04,173
you take your giant hand and jam it into his maw.

3823
02:26:04,173 --> 02:26:06,060
With this horrible (choking SFX) sound,

3824
02:26:06,060 --> 02:26:08,061
as you put all your muscle into it,

3825
02:26:08,061 --> 02:26:10,737
glaring him in the face with a terrible grin you 
(breaking SFX)

3826
02:26:10,737 --> 02:26:13,223
and yank the jaw off from the bottom of his head.

3827
02:26:13,223 --> 02:26:15,318
ALL: (cheering)

3828
02:26:15,318 --> 02:26:17,485
MATT: A spatter of blood across the front of his mouth

3829
02:26:17,485 --> 02:26:20,983
and his tongue dangling, he gives out this horrible 
(gagging scream)

3830
02:26:20,983 --> 02:26:22,817
this gurgling scream as all the blood begins

3831
02:26:22,817 --> 02:26:24,769
to pour up into his throat.

3832
02:26:24,769 --> 02:26:27,716
With that, clutching the jaw with one hand,

3833
02:26:27,716 --> 02:26:30,561
you begin to pummel him in the face over and over,

3834
02:26:30,561 --> 02:26:33,787
with his jaw, as he's watching, his head slowly cave in.

3835
02:26:33,787 --> 02:26:35,071
TRAVIS: (laughing) Yes!

3836
02:26:35,071 --> 02:26:36,442
SAM: I think he's going to make it.

3837
02:26:36,442 --> 02:26:37,639
MATT: Until eventually, he's no longer moving

3838
02:26:37,639 --> 02:26:39,861
and you throw the jaw to the ground, 
just coated with blood.

3839
02:26:39,861 --> 02:26:41,158
LIAM: You're going to pull through, buddy.

3840
02:26:41,158 --> 02:26:43,098
LAURA: Pike! I think Grog, um, I think he did his job.

3841
02:26:43,098 --> 02:26:44,108
ASHLEY: I scream out,

3842
02:26:44,108 --> 02:26:46,882
"Good job Grog! That's your best one yet!"

3843
02:26:46,882 --> 02:26:49,058
MARISHA: And they say video games are violent.

3844
02:26:49,058 --> 02:26:50,438
(all laugh)

3845
02:26:50,438 --> 02:26:51,786
LAURA: (gagging sounds)

3846
02:26:53,876 --> 02:26:55,344
MATT: As you've entered the room now--

3847
02:26:55,344 --> 02:26:56,329
ASHLEY: Wait, is he dead?

3848
02:26:56,329 --> 02:26:58,322
(all laugh)

3849
02:26:58,322 --> 02:26:59,604
MATT: Oh, he's very dead.

3850
02:26:59,604 --> 02:27:02,374
TRAVIS: We made cheese of him.

3851
02:27:02,374 --> 02:27:04,236
MATT: He lies there limply on the wall,

3852
02:27:04,236 --> 02:27:06,347
twitching every few seconds.

3853
02:27:06,347 --> 02:27:08,324
Grog, still in a rage, you look over at the other individual.

3854
02:27:08,324 --> 02:27:12,280
You can see now strapped to this wooden frame

3855
02:27:12,280 --> 02:27:15,356
is a smallish humanoid, female,

3856
02:27:15,356 --> 02:27:18,283
currently chained and being pulled on a rack.

3857
02:27:18,283 --> 02:27:20,351
You can see bunch of scars and wounds,

3858
02:27:20,351 --> 02:27:21,598
blood pouring from each one of them.

3859
02:27:21,598 --> 02:27:22,635
SAM: Is that our girl?

3860
02:27:22,635 --> 02:27:23,467
LAURA: That's our girl!

3861
02:27:23,467 --> 02:27:25,123
TALIESIN: I'm running in. 
Do I know how to disable the rack?

3862
02:27:25,123 --> 02:27:28,264
MATT: You can probably figure it out with a tinker.

3863
02:27:28,264 --> 02:27:29,791
LIAM: Pike!
TRAVIS: Is it chains or rope?

3864
02:27:29,791 --> 02:27:31,646
LAURA: Come heal her!
LIAM: We need Pike in here!

3865
02:27:31,646 --> 02:27:33,392
TRAVIS: Is it chains or rope?
SAM: I'll go!

3866
02:27:33,392 --> 02:27:35,298
MATT: It's chains holding her on.

3867
02:27:35,298 --> 02:27:37,391
TALIESIN: I'm going to undo it.

3868
02:27:37,391 --> 02:27:38,424
MATT: Okay.

3869
02:27:38,424 --> 02:27:39,738
SAM: Wait. Do we know it's her?

3870
02:27:39,738 --> 02:27:40,782
MATT: Go ahead and make a tinker check.

3871
02:27:40,782 --> 02:27:41,869
LAURA: It's her. It's gotta be her.

3872
02:27:41,869 --> 02:27:43,211
ORION: Whoever it is, we should help.

3873
02:27:43,211 --> 02:27:44,530
TALIESIN: What do I add? 
Is it proficiency bonus?

3874
02:27:44,530 --> 02:27:46,076
MATT: Proficiency bonus.

3875
02:27:46,076 --> 02:27:47,430
TALIESIN: 12.

3876
02:27:47,430 --> 02:27:48,498
MATT: 12?

3877
02:27:48,498 --> 02:27:50,978
You take a moment and you manage to find

3878
02:27:50,978 --> 02:27:51,926
where the winch to this machine is,

3879
02:27:51,926 --> 02:27:53,067
where you can go ahead and release the tension

3880
02:27:53,067 --> 02:27:54,792
and eventually the chains go a little more slack

3881
02:27:54,792 --> 02:27:59,942
and (gasps) the halfling woman takes a deep breath

3882
02:27:59,942 --> 02:28:01,224
and looks about the room a second,

3883
02:28:01,224 --> 02:28:03,117
looks like there's a bit of a haze, but through the haze

3884
02:28:03,117 --> 02:28:08,196
there's this constant anger and 
she looks down and goes:

3885
02:28:08,196 --> 02:28:11,269
“So? Are you gonna let me go?

3886
02:28:11,269 --> 02:28:13,731
“Come on! Release these chains!”

3887
02:28:13,731 --> 02:28:15,233
ASHLEY: Who is she?

3888
02:28:15,233 --> 02:28:16,591
TRAVIS: Wait, wait. Find out who she is first.

3889
02:28:16,591 --> 02:28:19,380
LAURA: Can we insight and make sure that it's 
really who she--

3890
02:28:19,380 --> 02:28:21,483
MATT: You can indeed.

3891
02:28:21,483 --> 02:28:23,581
This is an insight check.

3892
02:28:23,581 --> 02:28:26,745
LAURA: Great, I don't get any...

3893
02:28:26,745 --> 02:28:29,261
Anybody else want to roll for insight?

3894
02:28:29,261 --> 02:28:31,514
LIAM: 5, 1. Pike, roll well. The twins fucked it.

3895
02:28:31,514 --> 02:28:33,624
ASHLEY: Insight?

3896
02:28:33,636 --> 02:28:35,247
LIAM: Scanlan! Come up here!

3897
02:28:35,247 --> 02:28:36,081
SAM: Yeah, yeah, oh.

3898
02:28:36,081 --> 02:28:37,338
ASHLEY: 15! 15?

3899
02:28:37,338 --> 02:28:40,269
LIAM: She's not in her right mind.

3900
02:28:40,269 --> 02:28:41,716
MATT: It's a very small room, only a few people 
can make it in here.

3901
02:28:41,716 --> 02:28:42,841
SAM: I'm gonna take a peek at her.

3902
02:28:42,841 --> 02:28:44,150
What do I do? What do I roll?

3903
02:28:44,150 --> 02:28:45,281
LIAM: Insight to see if she's in her right mind.

3904
02:28:45,281 --> 02:28:46,349
ASHLEY: 15? 18 is better.

3905
02:28:46,349 --> 02:28:49,373
MATT: At this point, it's pretty apparent that whatever

3906
02:28:49,373 --> 02:28:53,023
this woman is, she's been here a while

3907
02:28:53,023 --> 02:28:56,205
and has been subjected to many, many horrible things

3908
02:28:56,205 --> 02:29:00,375
and still has that spark of life to her,

3909
02:29:00,375 --> 02:29:03,843
mainly out of vengeance, anger, and pain,

3910
02:29:03,843 --> 02:29:07,430
but she does not seem to be overtly aggressive 
or trying to deceive you;

3911
02:29:07,430 --> 02:29:09,571
just trying to get out of these fucking chains.

3912
02:29:09,571 --> 02:29:11,129
LAURA: Well, let's let her go.

3913
02:29:11,129 --> 02:29:12,364
ORION: I'll do an Arcana check on her.

3914
02:29:12,364 --> 02:29:14,557
MATT: What's that? Arcana check? To...?

3915
02:29:14,557 --> 02:29:20,481
ORION: See if there's like any kind of magical impurities in her.

3916
02:29:20,481 --> 02:29:21,863
TRAVIS: If she's under the Imperius Curse.

3917
02:29:21,863 --> 02:29:23,121
MATT: Best you can tell, there's none.

3918
02:29:23,121 --> 02:29:24,288
LIAM: I'm pulling out my lockpicks and

3919
02:29:24,288 --> 02:29:25,690
I'm going to start working on--

3920
02:29:25,690 --> 02:29:27,727
SAM: I'm going to heal her with a little bit of a song.

3921
02:29:27,727 --> 02:29:30,250
LIAM: And you know my lockpick snaps so...

3922
02:29:30,250 --> 02:29:31,712
just totally broken.

3923
02:29:31,712 --> 02:29:34,014
ASHLEY: How hurt is she?

3924
02:29:34,014 --> 02:29:35,432
SAM: If I may.

3925
02:29:35,432 --> 02:29:37,576
MATT: She's pretty rough.

3926
02:29:37,576 --> 02:29:40,576
As you look up, she's not clothed.

3927
02:29:40,576 --> 02:29:48,663
Her body is just a spray of scars and 
gashes and rake marks.

3928
02:29:48,663 --> 02:29:52,878
She's been tortured to an extent 
you hadn't seen in person,

3929
02:29:52,878 --> 02:29:57,493
and to still be tensing her muscles against the chains

3930
02:29:57,493 --> 02:30:00,329
and looking at you with this intensity,

3931
02:30:00,329 --> 02:30:01,980
if this is indeed Lady Kima,

3932
02:30:01,980 --> 02:30:04,518
you now see why she's made the reputation she has.

3933
02:30:04,518 --> 02:30:07,343
LIAM: Grog, the locking mechanism on this is jammed.

3934
02:30:07,343 --> 02:30:09,502
SAM: Okay. So, I step forward and I pull out my flute

3935
02:30:09,502 --> 02:30:12,329
and I sing, (singing)

3936
02:30:12,329 --> 02:30:16,391
"As long as I got my song and flute,

3937
02:30:16,391 --> 02:30:19,776
“I'm gonna give some healing to you.

3938
02:30:19,776 --> 02:30:22,395
“Love and magic in the air tonight,

3939
02:30:22,395 --> 02:30:25,168
“gonna give you some hit points.

3940
02:30:25,168 --> 02:30:27,918
“Gonna give you some hit points,

3941
02:30:27,918 --> 02:30:32,638
“gonna give you some hit points of our love.”

3942
02:30:32,638 --> 02:30:34,191
(all laugh)

3943
02:30:34,191 --> 02:30:36,169
SAM: Dadadanana, okay.

3944
02:30:36,169 --> 02:30:39,885
I roll 9 hit points.

3945
02:30:39,885 --> 02:30:44,617
MATT: The fresher wounds seal up, the 
blood flow comes to a stop.

3946
02:30:44,617 --> 02:30:47,105
You see her muscles tense for a moment -

3947
02:30:47,105 --> 02:30:49,342
her tension in her muscles relax for a minute.

3948
02:30:49,342 --> 02:30:51,247
She looks to you for a second and says,

3949
02:30:51,247 --> 02:30:55,327
“It's been a while since I've heard a song. Thank you.”

3950
02:30:55,327 --> 02:30:56,529
SAM: It was a slow jam.

3951
02:30:56,529 --> 02:30:57,788
TALIESIN: Please be careful for a moment.

3952
02:30:57,788 --> 02:30:59,641
Can someone cover her ears for just a second?

3953
02:30:59,641 --> 02:31:00,890
TRAVIS: Yeah, I got it.

3954
02:31:00,890 --> 02:31:01,975
ASHLEY: Earmuffs.

3955
02:31:01,975 --> 02:31:03,776
TALIESIN: I'm going to utility shot -

3956
02:31:03,776 --> 02:31:05,763
I'm going to put my gun against the lock,

3957
02:31:05,763 --> 02:31:09,020
somewhere where it will not harm her and just blow it.

3958
02:31:09,020 --> 02:31:12,231
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

3959
02:31:12,231 --> 02:31:15,148
You don't have to roll to hit, it's right there.

3960
02:31:17,573 --> 02:31:19,022
TALIESIN: 15.

3961
02:31:19,022 --> 02:31:21,583
Is it two locks?

3962
02:31:21,583 --> 02:31:25,020
MATT: Well, there's one chain for the legs, 
one chain for the arms.

3963
02:31:25,020 --> 02:31:29,603
TALIESIN: Okay. 15 for the leg. 10 for the arm.

3964
02:31:29,603 --> 02:31:31,393
MATT: (gunshot sound) The legs get free.

3965
02:31:31,393 --> 02:31:35,125
(gunshot sound) The chain mostly 
snaps on the top part,

3966
02:31:35,125 --> 02:31:36,563
but not quite enough.

3967
02:31:36,563 --> 02:31:37,833
It's enough for you, Grog, to-

3968
02:31:37,833 --> 02:31:39,695
TRAVIS: I got it! (snarling)

3969
02:31:39,695 --> 02:31:41,356
MATT: You reach over and bring it down,

3970
02:31:41,356 --> 02:31:42,881
with a brief moment of extreme tension

3971
02:31:42,881 --> 02:31:44,625
as the whole room watches Grog walk up with his axe

3972
02:31:44,625 --> 02:31:47,981
and swing it down towards this halfling.

3973
02:31:47,981 --> 02:31:49,600
Before you have a moment to stop,

3974
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:51,441
everyone's heart skips a beat.

3975
02:31:51,441 --> 02:31:52,953
The chain is bisected--

3976
02:31:52,953 --> 02:31:54,666
LIAM: Ease down! Ease down.

3977
02:31:54,666 --> 02:31:56,359
MATT: --at which point the halfling woman immediately

3978
02:31:56,359 --> 02:31:58,063
jumps to her feet with almost like a kip-up stand

3979
02:31:58,063 --> 02:32:02,071
and is now standing on top of the table.

3980
02:32:02,071 --> 02:32:05,700
Her arms are still bound and she - (groans)

3981
02:32:05,700 --> 02:32:07,823
You can now see where the metal was 
weakened from the axe blow.

3982
02:32:07,823 --> 02:32:09,867
She (metal snapping SFX) pulls herself free

3983
02:32:09,867 --> 02:32:11,271
from the metal binding--

3984
02:32:11,271 --> 02:32:12,500
TRAVIS: That's hot.

3985
02:32:12,500 --> 02:32:14,453
MATT: --there's a blister across her wrist,

3986
02:32:14,453 --> 02:32:17,336
from how long she's been pulling 
against these restraints.

3987
02:32:17,336 --> 02:32:19,063
But she bore through it, with a little bit of blood

3988
02:32:19,063 --> 02:32:20,775
that trickles from that wound.

3989
02:32:20,775 --> 02:32:23,963
She has freed herself and she looks 
around the rest of the group.

3990
02:32:25,609 --> 02:32:27,979
“So, I take it you're not from around here?”

3991
02:32:27,979 --> 02:32:30,832
ORION: No! Would you like some water?

3992
02:32:30,832 --> 02:32:33,359
MATT: She grabs it from you, pulls off the cork

3993
02:32:33,359 --> 02:32:35,857
and just starts chugging like she hasn't had anything

3994
02:32:35,857 --> 02:32:37,350
to drink in a long time.

3995
02:32:37,350 --> 02:32:39,079
LAURA: Lady Kima, we need to get you out of here.

3996
02:32:39,079 --> 02:32:40,845
LIAM: Allura has sent us.

3997
02:32:40,845 --> 02:32:43,830
MATT: She caps it off after a moment 
and takes a deep breath.

3998
02:32:43,830 --> 02:32:50,068
“I'd hoped she would. It was foolish of me 
to come down here so unprepared.

3999
02:32:50,068 --> 02:32:54,581
“Just knew there wasn't much time.” (chuckles)

4000
02:32:54,581 --> 02:32:57,035
LIAM: Time 'til what?

4001
02:32:57,035 --> 02:33:00,003
MATT: She looks around and says,

4002
02:33:00,003 --> 02:33:02,758
“Look, we don't- it's a story. I have no--”

4003
02:33:02,758 --> 02:33:05,101
And she kind of points to her pretty much

4004
02:33:05,101 --> 02:33:07,837
unclothed, unarmored form, and says,

4005
02:33:07,837 --> 02:33:11,212
“I need to find my implements. We need to get out of here.”

4006
02:33:11,212 --> 02:33:14,663
TRAVIS: Could I offer to you this black, 
studded leather, dwarven armor?

4007
02:33:14,663 --> 02:33:16,351
It's not leather, actually.

4008
02:33:16,351 --> 02:33:18,199
LIAM: It's magical, it'll fit you.

4009
02:33:18,199 --> 02:33:20,702
ORION: Would you care for this robe?

4010
02:33:20,702 --> 02:33:22,223
LAURA: Which sounds better?

4011
02:33:22,223 --> 02:33:24,066
MATT: What armor were you offering her?

4012
02:33:24,066 --> 02:33:25,453
TRAVIS: It's the black, dwarven armor--

4013
02:33:25,453 --> 02:33:26,915
LIAM: The armor that I found and gave to Grog.

4014
02:33:26,915 --> 02:33:28,280
It's magical.

4015
02:33:28,280 --> 02:33:29,643
MATT: Oh, the studded leather.

4016
02:33:29,643 --> 02:33:30,646
LIAM: Yes.

4017
02:33:30,646 --> 02:33:31,733
TRAVIS: It's in the bag.

4018
02:33:31,733 --> 02:33:33,128
MATT: She goes, “Sure, it works for now.”

4019
02:33:33,128 --> 02:33:34,370
She takes it from you and starts putting it on.

4020
02:33:34,370 --> 02:33:35,488
You see her wincing as she puts it on,

4021
02:33:35,488 --> 02:33:36,946
as it covers some of the wounds.

4022
02:33:36,946 --> 02:33:39,094
Her whole body is just sore, but she still pushes through it.

4023
02:33:39,094 --> 02:33:40,599
ASHLEY: I'm going to heal her a little bit more.

4024
02:33:40,599 --> 02:33:41,608
MATT: Okay.

4025
02:33:41,608 --> 02:33:42,933
ASHLEY: I'll put my hands on her.

4026
02:33:42,933 --> 02:33:44,942
I'm sorry. You're not fully healed, let me help you out.

4027
02:33:44,942 --> 02:33:46,411
TRAVIS: (quietly) Grog likes scars.

4028
02:33:46,411 --> 02:33:49,483
MATT: As you do, she takes a moment and she says -

4029
02:33:49,483 --> 02:33:50,932
You heal her and she goes,

4030
02:33:50,932 --> 02:33:51,944
“Can I-”

4031
02:33:51,944 --> 02:33:53,049
She sees your mace and goes,

4032
02:33:53,049 --> 02:33:54,144
“Can I borrow that for a second?”

4033
02:33:54,144 --> 02:33:55,146
ASHLEY: Uh...

4034
02:33:55,146 --> 02:33:56,238
MATT: “Please?”

4035
02:33:56,238 --> 02:33:57,162
ASHLEY: My mace?

4036
02:33:57,162 --> 02:33:58,346
MATT: “Your mace, please.”

4037
02:33:58,346 --> 02:33:59,865
ASHLEY: What do you need it for?

4038
02:33:59,865 --> 02:34:01,964
(all laugh)

4039
02:34:01,964 --> 02:34:03,388
TRAVIS: You can have mine.

4040
02:34:03,388 --> 02:34:04,414
MATT: “Do you trust me?”

4041
02:34:04,414 --> 02:34:06,967
ASHLEY: I don't know. This is all I have 
to protect myself.

4042
02:34:06,967 --> 02:34:09,778
MATT: “You've come this far.”

4043
02:34:09,778 --> 02:34:12,650
ORION: Grog has something for you.

4044
02:34:12,650 --> 02:34:14,274
SAM: Say yes to life, Pike.

4045
02:34:14,274 --> 02:34:16,168
ASHLEY: All right, well, I also have 
a morningstar, but this is--

4046
02:34:16,168 --> 02:34:17,506
(all laugh)

4047
02:34:17,506 --> 02:34:19,143
ASHLEY: Are you gonna give it back?

4048
02:34:19,143 --> 02:34:22,124
MATT: As you hand it out, she grabs it from your hands--

4049
02:34:22,124 --> 02:34:23,399
ASHLEY: That was rude.

4050
02:34:23,399 --> 02:34:24,747
MATT: --walks to the edge of the table--

4051
02:34:24,747 --> 02:34:25,874
ASHLEY: I don't like her.

4052
02:34:25,874 --> 02:34:29,145
MATT: --stares at the dwarf that is 
currently hooked onto the wall.

4053
02:34:29,145 --> 02:34:32,920
(angry yell) And with a yell, slams it right into his face,

4054
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:35,943
causing his head to explode against the back of the wall.

4055
02:34:35,943 --> 02:34:38,131
Slams it again and again and again,

4056
02:34:38,131 --> 02:34:41,632
and is just making hamburger of his entire body.

4057
02:34:41,632 --> 02:34:44,209
The arm sloughs off and she's just going nuts.

4058
02:34:44,209 --> 02:34:46,176
You can see her bludgeoning over and over again

4059
02:34:46,176 --> 02:34:47,963
with a spray of gore on her.

4060
02:34:47,963 --> 02:34:50,124
And there's this look of anger, frustration--

4061
02:34:50,124 --> 02:34:51,279
LAURA: She's raging.

4062
02:34:51,279 --> 02:34:53,445
MATT: --and a sick sense of joy a little bit in her eyes

4063
02:34:53,445 --> 02:34:55,881
in how she's just tearing this dwarf apart.

4064
02:34:55,881 --> 02:34:57,953
Eventually, after this frenzy, you're all taken aback,

4065
02:34:57,953 --> 02:35:00,339
and she takes a moment. (heavy breathing)

4066
02:35:00,339 --> 02:35:03,396
There is very little left recognizable of 
what once was a duergar.

4067
02:35:03,396 --> 02:35:05,680
SAM: I notice a bulge in Grog's pants.

4068
02:35:05,680 --> 02:35:07,264
(all laugh)

4069
02:35:07,264 --> 02:35:12,231
ORION: I use my Mage Hand to slowly 
pick up my bottle of water...

4070
02:35:12,231 --> 02:35:13,669
(all laugh)

4071
02:35:13,669 --> 02:35:19,302
MATT: Okay. She takes the mace she borrowed 
from you. (splatter sound)

4072
02:35:19,302 --> 02:35:20,747
ASHLEY: I'm sorry I questioned you.

4073
02:35:20,747 --> 02:35:22,398
MATT: As she begins to hand it back to you,

4074
02:35:22,398 --> 02:35:24,807
there's a slight flash of radiant energy that emanates

4075
02:35:24,807 --> 02:35:27,259
from her hand, and it burns all of the blood

4076
02:35:27,259 --> 02:35:29,907
that currently encapsulates the mace off,

4077
02:35:29,907 --> 02:35:31,688
and hands it back to you.

4078
02:35:31,688 --> 02:35:33,775
“Thank you. I needed that.”

4079
02:35:33,775 --> 02:35:36,187
ASHLEY: You're very welcome. I'm sorry I questioned you.

4080
02:35:36,187 --> 02:35:37,503
ORION: Give her something, Grog!

4081
02:35:37,503 --> 02:35:38,720
Let her use one of your things!

4082
02:35:38,720 --> 02:35:40,456
TRAVIS: That was amazing.

4083
02:35:40,456 --> 02:35:41,636
(all laugh)

4084
02:35:41,636 --> 02:35:43,424
ORION: Like, you know, give her one of your things, Grog.

4085
02:35:43,424 --> 02:35:46,010
TRAVIS: Could I, um, would you like to touch my axe?

4086
02:35:46,010 --> 02:35:47,443
(all laugh)

4087
02:35:47,443 --> 02:35:49,975
MATT: “If you want to part with it, certainly.“

4088
02:35:49,975 --> 02:35:52,403
TRAVIS: Oh, uh. (clears throat, sniffs)

4089
02:35:52,403 --> 02:35:54,152
Maybe we should get out of here.

4090
02:35:54,152 --> 02:35:56,535
(all laugh)

4091
02:35:56,535 --> 02:35:58,659
TALIESIN: Why don't we collect your things?

4092
02:35:58,659 --> 02:36:00,345
LAURA: Yeah, where are they? Do you know?

4093
02:36:00,345 --> 02:36:01,752
TALIESIN: I would assume they're being stored upstairs.

4094
02:36:01,752 --> 02:36:02,952
MATT: “I have no idea.

4095
02:36:02,952 --> 02:36:04,100
“They're either in the vault or they're in the armory.”

4096
02:36:04,100 --> 02:36:05,719
SAM: Vault or the armory?

4097
02:36:05,719 --> 02:36:07,066
Those are places that we can go?

4098
02:36:07,066 --> 02:36:08,349
LAURA: There's a vault?

4099
02:36:08,349 --> 02:36:11,232
TALIESIN: Are there stairs in the room that we're in?

4100
02:36:11,232 --> 02:36:12,457
MATT: “As far as I can tell, my--”

4101
02:36:12,457 --> 02:36:14,288
LIAM: Lady Kima, are these things absolutely necessary?

4102
02:36:14,288 --> 02:36:16,518
We have a secret entrance to this place.

4103
02:36:16,518 --> 02:36:18,272
We could leave now.

4104
02:36:18,272 --> 02:36:22,267
Are they of vital importance, the things you've lost?

4105
02:36:22,267 --> 02:36:26,048
MATT: She thinks to herself for a second, and goes,

4106
02:36:26,048 --> 02:36:28,696
“They are divine implements, gifted to me from

4107
02:36:28,696 --> 02:36:30,709
“an avatar of Bahamut directly.

4108
02:36:30,709 --> 02:36:34,259
“I feel, to leave them behind would 
be a partial failure to my quest.

4109
02:36:34,259 --> 02:36:38,062
“Not to mention, that what we may face beyond this,

4110
02:36:38,062 --> 02:36:39,725
“we'll need every bit of help we can get.”

4111
02:36:39,725 --> 02:36:40,700
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

4112
02:36:40,700 --> 02:36:41,794
LIAM: Well, that's that then.

4113
02:36:41,794 --> 02:36:42,962
ORION: You'll have a friend in us, that's for sure.

4114
02:36:42,962 --> 02:36:44,178
LAURA: Let's find the frigging vault!

4115
02:36:44,178 --> 02:36:45,872
TALIESIN: Let's go upstairs.
LIAM: Let's go to the vault! Let's go upstairs.

4116
02:36:45,872 --> 02:36:46,991
MATT: As you show the back of that card,

4117
02:36:46,991 --> 02:36:48,301
she gives you a look and smiles and says,

4118
02:36:48,301 --> 02:36:50,910
“Ah. It's good to see that your scale of color

4119
02:36:50,910 --> 02:36:52,329
“does not belie your intent.

4120
02:36:52,329 --> 02:36:57,508
“That is a face I've not seen for some time. 
I thank you.”

4121
02:36:57,508 --> 02:37:01,146
She leaps off the table.

4122
02:37:01,146 --> 02:37:04,876
“So.” (sighs) “Shall we?”

4123
02:37:07,136 --> 02:37:09,270
SAM: Do you know where the vault is?

4124
02:37:09,270 --> 02:37:10,412
MATT: “I can show you.”

4125
02:37:10,412 --> 02:37:11,363
LAURA: (whispering) Yes!

4126
02:37:11,363 --> 02:37:12,406
SAM: Lead the way!

4127
02:37:12,406 --> 02:37:13,794
MARISHA: I go up to her, still in my Minxy form,

4128
02:37:13,794 --> 02:37:18,254
and I rub on her legs.

4129
02:37:18,254 --> 02:37:20,049
TALIESIN: Have you dropped the body yet?

4130
02:37:20,049 --> 02:37:21,780
TRAVIS: I get right up behind them too, competing for space.

4131
02:37:21,780 --> 02:37:22,935
TALIESIN: Are you dragging a dead body around?

4132
02:37:22,935 --> 02:37:24,202
MARISHA: No, I dropped the body.

4133
02:37:24,202 --> 02:37:25,613
While she was talking, I took the body,

4134
02:37:25,613 --> 02:37:28,372
and I drug it back, and I buried my shame.

4135
02:37:28,372 --> 02:37:32,469
(all laugh)

4136
02:37:32,469 --> 02:37:34,269
MARISHA: So, first, I buried my shame.

4137
02:37:34,269 --> 02:37:35,773
MATT: Your shame has been sufficiently buried.

4138
02:37:35,773 --> 02:37:37,319
(laughter continues)

4139
02:37:37,319 --> 02:37:38,701
ORION: Hashtag bury your shame.

4140
02:37:38,701 --> 02:37:43,576
MARISHA: And I purr.

4141
02:37:43,576 --> 02:37:45,548
MATT: She doesn't look at you,

4142
02:37:45,548 --> 02:37:47,337
but she pats you absentmindedly as she passes you,

4143
02:37:47,337 --> 02:37:50,726
her direct intent on heading back up those stairs herself.

4144
02:37:50,726 --> 02:37:51,930
LAURA: All right.

4145
02:37:51,930 --> 02:37:53,376
SAM: Let's go, but should we unlock all the other dwarves?

4146
02:37:53,376 --> 02:37:55,035
LAURA: Yes, let's let all the other dwarves out,

4147
02:37:55,035 --> 02:37:58,140
and maybe give them some food to 
try to help them out, if we can.

4148
02:37:58,140 --> 02:38:00,871
TRAVIS: In the meantime, I have a greatsword

4149
02:38:00,871 --> 02:38:03,510
or a morningstar mace that you can have

4150
02:38:03,510 --> 02:38:06,043
until we find your items.

4151
02:38:06,043 --> 02:38:07,163
MATT: “Greatsword.”

4152
02:38:07,163 --> 02:38:09,339
TRAVIS: Greatsword it is.

4153
02:38:09,339 --> 02:38:11,952
MATT: She takes it from you, and the sword is

4154
02:38:11,952 --> 02:38:14,892
a little over a foot taller than she is.

4155
02:38:14,892 --> 02:38:16,758
Maybe a little more than that.

4156
02:38:16,758 --> 02:38:17,743
LAURA: She's really fricking buff.

4157
02:38:17,743 --> 02:38:20,253
MATT: But as you hand it to her, she 
still takes it, and you can see--

4158
02:38:20,253 --> 02:38:21,597
LIAM: She's a ripped halfling.
LAURA: That's pretty badass.

4159
02:38:21,597 --> 02:38:22,728
MATT: --she is a built halfling female.

4160
02:38:22,728 --> 02:38:25,943
She has seen some war, and she 
has survived some shit.

4161
02:38:25,943 --> 02:38:27,625
LIAM: She's the Tyler Durden of halflings.

4162
02:38:27,625 --> 02:38:28,792
(all laugh)

4163
02:38:28,792 --> 02:38:30,537
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

4164
02:38:30,537 --> 02:38:31,808
TRAVIS: As I see her grab the sword, I ask,

4165
02:38:31,808 --> 02:38:33,382
“Would you care for some ale?”

4166
02:38:33,382 --> 02:38:35,025
(all laugh)

4167
02:38:35,025 --> 02:38:37,123
MATT: She glances over her shoulder 
at you, and says,

4168
02:38:37,123 --> 02:38:39,259
“Later. We have nothing to celebrate for yet.”

4169
02:38:39,259 --> 02:38:41,093
TRAVIS: Absolutely. Plenty of time!

4170
02:38:41,093 --> 02:38:43,010
(all laugh)

4171
02:38:43,010 --> 02:38:44,530
LIAM: I think Grog is smitten!

4172
02:38:44,530 --> 02:38:46,061
LAURA: She comes to your knee.

4173
02:38:46,061 --> 02:38:47,158
LIAM: Oh my goodness!

4174
02:38:47,158 --> 02:38:49,792
LAURA: Can I run in the little prison, 
and tell the dwarves,

4175
02:38:49,792 --> 02:38:51,487
if they are conscious, to say,

4176
02:38:51,487 --> 02:38:53,806
“Don't exit from where you came.

4177
02:38:53,806 --> 02:38:55,730
“There's a secret entrance up and in a store room.

4178
02:38:55,730 --> 02:38:57,325
“Go that way, and stealth out.”

4179
02:38:57,325 --> 02:39:00,246
MATT: One of the ones that was semi-conscious--

4180
02:39:00,246 --> 02:39:01,949
LAURA: All of that, I say all of it.

4181
02:39:01,949 --> 02:39:04,588
MATT: He sits up and looks at-- (laughs)

4182
02:39:04,588 --> 02:39:05,802
That's fucked up.

4183
02:39:05,802 --> 02:39:07,937
Sits up and looks back at you and - (ragged breathing)

4184
02:39:07,937 --> 02:39:09,892
“Thank ye. Thank ye kindly.”

4185
02:39:09,892 --> 02:39:11,219
LAURA: Here's some cheese!

4186
02:39:11,219 --> 02:39:12,378
(all laugh)

4187
02:39:12,378 --> 02:39:13,842
MATT: He takes it hungrily through the bars

4188
02:39:13,842 --> 02:39:16,236
and just starts eating it, incessantly, as you leave.

4189
02:39:16,236 --> 02:39:18,117
TALIESIN: Government cheese.

4190
02:39:18,117 --> 02:39:19,479
LIAM: Is provolone all you've got?

4191
02:39:19,479 --> 02:39:22,459
MATT: Lady Kima's already up the stairs.

4192
02:39:22,459 --> 02:39:23,689
LAURA: It's Velveeta.

4193
02:39:23,689 --> 02:39:24,779
MATT: (disgusted groan) Velveeta!

4194
02:39:24,779 --> 02:39:26,227
SAM: We're following up the stairs.

4195
02:39:26,227 --> 02:39:28,263
MARISHA: (laughs) It's calories!

4196
02:39:28,263 --> 02:39:31,318
MATT: All right. Clean this off here.

4197
02:39:31,318 --> 02:39:32,430
LAURA: Oh goodness, oh goodness!

4198
02:39:32,430 --> 02:39:36,083
TALIESIN: It's going to be fun! Savage burning--

4199
02:39:36,083 --> 02:39:38,737
TRAVIS: I'm right with Minxy, competing for first place.

4200
02:39:38,737 --> 02:39:40,688
LIAM: I place a hand on Lady Kima’s shoulder--

4201
02:39:40,688 --> 02:39:42,421
MARISHA: First place, for how fucked-up we are.

4202
02:39:42,421 --> 02:39:43,478
TRAVIS: Perfection! (laughs)

4203
02:39:43,478 --> 02:39:44,669
MARISHA: Perfection! (laughs)

4204
02:39:44,669 --> 02:39:45,935
LIAM: --place a hand on Kima's shoulder and say,

4205
02:39:45,935 --> 02:39:46,954
“Please, allow me,”

4206
02:39:46,954 --> 02:39:49,272
and move several feet ahead of her
and start sneaking along.

4207
02:39:49,272 --> 02:39:52,252
MATT: As you move up to her, you notice she's standing

4208
02:39:52,252 --> 02:39:55,539
at the bottom of the stairs with a tension,

4209
02:39:55,539 --> 02:39:58,057
staring up at the top of the stairway,

4210
02:39:58,057 --> 02:39:59,729
where Clarota is looking down at her--

4211
02:39:59,729 --> 02:40:00,756
LAURA: (gasps)

4212
02:40:00,756 --> 02:40:02,166
MATT: --and backing away, and she goes--

4213
02:40:02,166 --> 02:40:03,213
ORION: Oh! Yes. Uh--

4214
02:40:03,213 --> 02:40:04,248
LAURA: Wait- Wait!

4215
02:40:04,248 --> 02:40:05,194
MATT: “Who is this filthy--”

4216
02:40:05,194 --> 02:40:06,453
TALIESIN: No no no no!

4217
02:40:06,453 --> 02:40:07,359
MARISHA: (screams)

4218
02:40:07,359 --> 02:40:08,549
ORION: I put my Mage Hand in front of her.

4219
02:40:08,549 --> 02:40:09,592
Wait, wa-wait! Hold on! It- it's fine!

4220
02:40:09,592 --> 02:40:10,911
Er, this mind flayer is with us!

4221
02:40:10,911 --> 02:40:12,763
We saved him, or he- he's our ally now; he's fine.

4222
02:40:12,763 --> 02:40:15,470
No one needs to fight.

4223
02:40:15,470 --> 02:40:20,768
He, uh, she's fine, he's fine. His name is Clarota.

4224
02:40:20,768 --> 02:40:22,540
TALIESIN: He's been an enormous help.

4225
02:40:22,540 --> 02:40:24,407
MATT: Without taking her eyes off of Clarota--

4226
02:40:24,407 --> 02:40:25,495
ORION: This is Kiva-

4227
02:40:25,495 --> 02:40:26,192
SAM: Kima.

4228
02:40:26,192 --> 02:40:27,257
ORION: Kima.

4229
02:40:27,257 --> 02:40:28,548
MATT: She looks back over - (laughs)

4230
02:40:28,548 --> 02:40:34,006
ORION: We are allies, all, yes?

4231
02:40:34,006 --> 02:40:36,707
MATT: “Are you to tell me that you've come down here

4232
02:40:36,707 --> 02:40:42,380
“and allied yourself with an entity that 
is the anathema of the Mountain?”

4233
02:40:42,380 --> 02:40:43,598
ORION: Yes!

4234
02:40:43,598 --> 02:40:45,067
TRAVIS: Uh, what was that word?

4235
02:40:45,067 --> 02:40:46,597
LIAM: I'm right at her shoulder, so I say,

4236
02:40:46,617 --> 02:40:50,579
“We understand he's dangerous, but he's gotten us this far.”

4237
02:40:50,579 --> 02:40:51,692
MATT: “And for what purpose?

4238
02:40:51,692 --> 02:40:54,325
“You think they don't have plots lined out 
for weeks and months--”

4239
02:40:54,325 --> 02:40:55,808
ORION: No, no, no! Listen, listen-

4240
02:40:55,808 --> 02:40:57,253
MATT: “--there is no trust to be had with these creatures.”

4241
02:40:57,253 --> 02:40:59,907
LIAM: He has been shit out by these creatures.

4242
02:40:59,907 --> 02:41:04,354
They do not want him or trust him. 
He is an outcast.

4243
02:41:04,354 --> 02:41:08,250
And we are working together, in this moment,

4244
02:41:08,250 --> 02:41:11,107
and without him we would not have gotten here.

4245
02:41:11,107 --> 02:41:13,042
LAURA: We see a single tear drop from Clarota's eye.

4246
02:41:13,042 --> 02:41:14,950
MATT: “And with him you will never get out.”

4247
02:41:14,950 --> 02:41:18,140
ORION: No! We have his, er, alliance.

4248
02:41:18,140 --> 02:41:21,088
There's a greater entity controlling his people,

4249
02:41:21,088 --> 02:41:26,131
which he has been outcast from, like Vax was saying!

4250
02:41:26,131 --> 02:41:27,571
MATT: “And have you not thought for a second

4251
02:41:27,571 --> 02:41:29,809
“that perhaps all of you are being 
manipulated by this creature?”

4252
02:41:29,809 --> 02:41:31,693
ASHLEY: Well, I have.

4253
02:41:31,693 --> 02:41:33,125
MATT: You can see the greatsword now flares

4254
02:41:33,125 --> 02:41:34,411
with divine energy and she goes,

4255
02:41:34,411 --> 02:41:37,285
“I will not stand here and let us ally 
ourselves with this filth!”

4256
02:41:37,285 --> 02:41:39,235
ORION: (shouting) “Lady Kima!”

4257
02:41:39,235 --> 02:41:41,742
And I blow fire breath.

4258
02:41:41,742 --> 02:41:45,901
And I use Control Flames to create a bunch of swords

4259
02:41:45,901 --> 02:41:47,826
around me with fire.

4260
02:41:47,826 --> 02:41:49,709
LAURA: Don't threaten Kima! She's better.

4261
02:41:49,709 --> 02:41:51,116
ORION: (harshly) I give you my word.

4262
02:41:51,116 --> 02:41:52,579
MATT: Her attention divided from Clarota,

4263
02:41:52,579 --> 02:41:54,043
now tends towards you.

4264
02:41:54,043 --> 02:41:58,665
ORION: Don't act me a fool, and don't 
treat me like one either!

4265
02:41:58,665 --> 02:42:01,771
None of us are half-wits as you are claiming.

4266
02:42:01,771 --> 02:42:05,580
We would not be fooled by such a creature like this.

4267
02:42:05,580 --> 02:42:08,580
The words he speaks are true. And we believe him.

4268
02:42:08,580 --> 02:42:10,487
MATT: You go ahead and make a diplomacy check.

4269
02:42:10,487 --> 02:42:12,141
Or a persuasion. Persuasion check.

4270
02:42:12,141 --> 02:42:12,853
LAURA: Oh god!

4271
02:42:12,853 --> 02:42:13,860
LIAM: Get it on, Tiberius!

4272
02:42:13,860 --> 02:42:14,760
TRAVIS: Do it.

4273
02:42:14,760 --> 02:42:15,782
LIAM: Get. It. On.

4274
02:42:15,782 --> 02:42:17,426
ORION: That's terrible.

4275
02:42:17,426 --> 02:42:19,104
LIAM: Oh. Get it off?

4276
02:42:23,654 --> 02:42:24,903
SAM: Not good.

4277
02:42:24,903 --> 02:42:26,301
LAURA: Not good?

4278
02:42:26,301 --> 02:42:27,364
SAM: Not good!

4279
02:42:27,364 --> 02:42:28,681
ORION: 12.

4280
02:42:28,681 --> 02:42:31,905
MATT: 12. Okay. She walks towards you, 
and with each step,

4281
02:42:31,905 --> 02:42:33,900
you can see the color of her eyes begins to vanish,

4282
02:42:33,900 --> 02:42:37,330
giving way to an extremely bright, burning, silver light.

4283
02:42:37,330 --> 02:42:38,877
And she says--

4284
02:42:38,877 --> 02:42:40,883
LAURA: (whispering) Oh my god, she's so cool!

4285
02:42:40,883 --> 02:42:46,149
MATT: “Listen. You come with me. Without this creature!

4286
02:42:46,149 --> 02:42:48,722
“Or you continue with it, and without me.”

4287
02:42:48,722 --> 02:42:50,287
ORION: Why you have to be like that?

4288
02:42:50,287 --> 02:42:52,437
MATT: “I will not walk beside this.

4289
02:42:52,437 --> 02:42:56,281
“I have had its people devour mine since I set foot in here.

4290
02:42:56,281 --> 02:43:01,098
“This creature, whatever its reasoning is, is not in your best interest.

4291
02:43:01,098 --> 02:43:04,617
“It will lead you into a web of your own destruction!

4292
02:43:04,617 --> 02:43:07,158
“I've seen their kind work.“

4293
02:43:07,158 --> 02:43:08,787
LIAM: Clarota!

4294
02:43:08,787 --> 02:43:10,527
ORION: Yeah, they're mostly buttholes,
but he's not a butthole!

4295
02:43:10,527 --> 02:43:11,780
(all laugh)

4296
02:43:11,780 --> 02:43:12,742
ORION: I understand that -

4297
02:43:12,742 --> 02:43:13,811
LIAM: Clarota!

4298
02:43:13,811 --> 02:43:15,144
ORION: - we had to kill a couple and 
he actually helped a lot!

4299
02:43:15,144 --> 02:43:18,674
LIAM: Speak your mind! Convince her. Fix this.

4300
02:43:18,674 --> 02:43:22,110
MATT: Clarota, at the top of the stairs, 
you can see his tendrils

4301
02:43:22,110 --> 02:43:25,732
in his mouth curl back in a sneer, 
his hands crossed before--

4302
02:43:25,732 --> 02:43:27,279
ORION: He won't even do anything!

4303
02:43:27,279 --> 02:43:28,874
MATT: --Clarota says, (gasping, breathy voice)

4304
02:43:28,874 --> 02:43:35,937
“Listen. I am not going to walk where I am not welcome.

4305
02:43:35,937 --> 02:43:38,017
“I will not wake up with this--”

4306
02:43:38,017 --> 02:43:39,890
LIAM: Giving us a Walking Dead decision.

4307
02:43:39,890 --> 02:43:45,789
MATT: “--woman's blade in my back! We made a deal.”

4308
02:43:48,483 --> 02:43:51,701
MARISHA: People with kids. You deal with this all the time.

4309
02:43:51,701 --> 02:43:53,271
LIAM: I walk between them and put hands out.

4310
02:43:53,271 --> 02:43:54,426
LAURA: Come on, roll a 20!

4311
02:43:54,426 --> 02:43:55,671
LIAM: And say,

4312
02:43:55,671 --> 02:43:57,279
“We all want the same thing.

4313
02:43:57,279 --> 02:43:58,906
“Kima. Tell us. What is it that you've come here for?

4314
02:43:58,906 --> 02:44:02,399
“What is your purpose here? 
Speak your mind, if you are true.”

4315
02:44:02,399 --> 02:44:04,244
MATT: Kima turns back towards you,

4316
02:44:04,244 --> 02:44:07,984
the same glowing flare in her eyes.

4317
02:44:07,984 --> 02:44:11,259
“I've come here to rid this mountain and this continent

4318
02:44:11,259 --> 02:44:14,677
“of the darkness that resides deep within the bowels

4319
02:44:14,677 --> 02:44:15,992
“of this thing's city!”

4320
02:44:15,992 --> 02:44:20,299
LIAM: Clarota, why have you come here.
What is it you seek?

4321
02:44:20,299 --> 02:44:24,618
MATT: Clarota settles into itself for a second.

4322
02:44:24,618 --> 02:44:32,326
“Ah, I've come to destroy this creature 
K'Varn and free my people.”

4323
02:44:32,326 --> 02:44:36,140
LIAM: Then the two of you. Get over your fucking shit.

4324
02:44:36,140 --> 02:44:37,577
(all laugh)

4325
02:44:37,577 --> 02:44:39,756
LIAM: We want the same thing here.

4326
02:44:39,756 --> 02:44:42,586
Get over yourselves. Both of you.

4327
02:44:42,586 --> 02:44:44,767
We share a common purpose.

4328
02:44:44,767 --> 02:44:47,234
We are going to end this fucking bullshit.

4329
02:44:47,234 --> 02:44:50,005
Kima, we have come here for you.

4330
02:44:50,005 --> 02:44:53,437
Pay us the respect that we have earned.

4331
02:44:53,437 --> 02:44:56,328
We have come a long way for you.

4332
02:44:56,328 --> 02:45:00,943
He is an unlikely ally, but he has gotten us to this point.

4333
02:45:00,943 --> 02:45:04,061
And together, for this moment and this moment only,

4334
02:45:04,061 --> 02:45:05,914
we can work together.

4335
02:45:05,914 --> 02:45:09,355
We don't have to be school chums or 
buddies in a week from now.

4336
02:45:09,355 --> 02:45:12,744
But right now, right here, we will work together

4337
02:45:12,744 --> 02:45:14,385
and achieve the same thing.

4338
02:45:14,385 --> 02:45:16,664
What say you, Kima?

4339
02:45:16,664 --> 02:45:18,640
MATT: She looks towards you and says,

4340
02:45:20,550 --> 02:45:23,975
“Free his people, he says.

4341
02:45:23,975 --> 02:45:27,653
“What do you think will happen once 
his people are free?

4342
02:45:27,653 --> 02:45:29,591
“Shall they let us walk out on our own?”

4343
02:45:29,591 --> 02:45:31,473
ORION: Yes! He said so!

4344
02:45:31,473 --> 02:45:35,201
And then they'll be buttholes when we leave!

4345
02:45:37,128 --> 02:45:40,580
MATT: “You know so very little of these 
dark caverns, my dragon friend.”

4346
02:45:40,580 --> 02:45:41,921
ORION: Yeah, it's our first time here!

4347
02:45:41,921 --> 02:45:45,628
MATT: “These entities I watched steal 
the very life essence

4348
02:45:45,628 --> 02:45:48,927
“of the men and women I hired and travelled with

4349
02:45:48,927 --> 02:45:51,975
“for weeks down here. I watched them capture them,

4350
02:45:51,975 --> 02:45:55,075
“and devour their very minds before me,

4351
02:45:55,075 --> 02:45:58,558
“and laugh and cackle as I fled into the shadows.”

4352
02:45:58,558 --> 02:46:01,431
LAURA: But they were under control of 
K'Varn at that point. Yeah!

4353
02:46:01,431 --> 02:46:04,934
MATT: “Oh! Understand; whether or not K'Varn

4354
02:46:04,934 --> 02:46:07,687
“controls them to give them direction,

4355
02:46:07,687 --> 02:46:14,474
“they are of that type of mindset at all points.

4356
02:46:14,474 --> 02:46:16,872
“They do not hope society will thrive.

4357
02:46:16,872 --> 02:46:20,310
“They do not want us free peoples to walk the surface.

4358
02:46:20,310 --> 02:46:23,625
“They want us for food.“

4359
02:46:23,625 --> 02:46:25,744
SAM: Lady Kima, if I may.

4360
02:46:25,744 --> 02:46:34,423
If you're intending us to choose between you, 
and our ally Clarota,

4361
02:46:34,423 --> 02:46:38,132
and we can't get you to see eye to eye with us,

4362
02:46:38,132 --> 02:46:40,278
then I'm afraid you leave us no choice but

4363
02:46:40,278 --> 02:46:43,226
to choose our own friend Clarota over you.

4364
02:46:43,226 --> 02:46:44,670
LAURA: (gasps) What?

4365
02:46:44,670 --> 02:46:46,534
SAM: We're giving you one last chance.

4366
02:46:46,534 --> 02:46:50,612
Either you are with us, or you are against us.

4367
02:46:50,612 --> 02:46:53,242
This is a threat.

4368
02:46:53,242 --> 02:46:57,156
MATT: “So you walk in here, save me from my binds,

4369
02:46:57,156 --> 02:47:02,939
“under the words of my dear, 
lifelong friend Arcanist Allura--”

4370
02:47:02,939 --> 02:47:05,556
SAM: We mean you no ill will.

4371
02:47:05,556 --> 02:47:08,446
It is you who are aggravating the situation.

4372
02:47:08,446 --> 02:47:12,910
LIAM: You could be sitting in a cell 
by yourself doing fuck-all,

4373
02:47:12,910 --> 02:47:15,614
or ending this problem now.

4374
02:47:15,614 --> 02:47:18,211
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

4375
02:47:18,211 --> 02:47:20,156
MARISHA: Everyone's giving her inspirational talks.

4376
02:47:20,156 --> 02:47:23,044
LAURA: I'm so nervous! Oh, Scanlan, come on!

4377
02:47:24,539 --> 02:47:26,138
SAM: Well, I rolled a 3...

4378
02:47:26,138 --> 02:47:27,770
LIAM: I rolled a 13.

4379
02:47:27,770 --> 02:47:29,461
SAM: But I have a plus 13!

4380
02:47:29,461 --> 02:47:31,361
So that's a 16.

4381
02:47:31,361 --> 02:47:34,972
LIAM: Plus 13? 3 plus 13? Okay.

4382
02:47:34,972 --> 02:47:37,469
ASHLEY: Plus, plus, uh... hold on.

4383
02:47:37,469 --> 02:47:38,608
(all laugh)

4384
02:47:38,608 --> 02:47:40,401
ASHLEY: Because, you didn't- where the fuck.

4385
02:47:40,401 --> 02:47:42,654
(all laugh)

4386
02:47:42,654 --> 02:47:44,372
ASHLEY: War God's Blessing!

4387
02:47:44,372 --> 02:47:45,606
MATT: Cleric flail!

4388
02:47:45,606 --> 02:47:48,381
ASHLEY: No, I can't do that, because that's when 
a person makes an attack roll.

4389
02:47:48,381 --> 02:47:49,725
(all laugh)

4390
02:47:49,725 --> 02:47:51,276
ASHLEY: Get 'em, Scanlan!

4391
02:47:51,276 --> 02:47:52,128
(all laugh)

4392
02:47:52,128 --> 02:47:54,090
TALIESIN: Can I assist?

4393
02:47:54,090 --> 02:47:56,021
LAURA: He assisted because he was talking--

4394
02:47:56,021 --> 02:47:57,563
MATT: Unfortunately, it's too late. Once the roll--

4395
02:47:57,563 --> 02:47:59,123
SAM: No, he was with me, he was with me.

4396
02:47:59,123 --> 02:48:00,210
LAURA: He assisted?

4397
02:48:00,210 --> 02:48:04,033
MATT: Right, right. And because of that, the DC 
has been considered.

4398
02:48:04,033 --> 02:48:05,848
She takes a moment and steps forward.

4399
02:48:05,848 --> 02:48:08,105
She's a few inches taller than you.

4400
02:48:08,105 --> 02:48:09,708
SAM: Of course she is! Everyone is!

4401
02:48:09,708 --> 02:48:11,695
(all laugh)

4402
02:48:11,695 --> 02:48:14,153
MATT: And she looks at you, and says,

4403
02:48:14,153 --> 02:48:16,070
“He of the pretty voice.

4404
02:48:20,130 --> 02:48:23,935
“I am grateful that all of you have come and traversed

4405
02:48:23,935 --> 02:48:28,620
“all this danger in my name, to free me

4406
02:48:28,620 --> 02:48:31,275
“from the binds that have held me.

4407
02:48:31,275 --> 02:48:35,691
“And I do wish, very much, to walk 
alongside you to this end.

4408
02:48:35,691 --> 02:48:42,149
“And I understand, it may be very well
possible that this thing

4409
02:48:42,149 --> 02:48:47,427
“has taken your minds without 
your knowledge. However--”

4410
02:48:47,427 --> 02:48:50,052
And her eyes close for a second, and 
she opens them again,

4411
02:48:50,052 --> 02:48:53,068
and that radiant spark of silver fades,

4412
02:48:53,068 --> 02:48:55,328
and her normal eye color returns.

4413
02:48:57,068 --> 02:48:59,603
“We see ourselves with little choices.

4414
02:49:04,473 --> 02:49:08,263
“And I have very little allies at this point 
to achieve my goal.”

4415
02:49:08,263 --> 02:49:09,937
LAURA: (whispering) Oh, thank god.

4416
02:49:09,937 --> 02:49:17,977
MATT: “If we are to travel together, this one 
must walk in step the entire time.

4417
02:49:17,977 --> 02:49:22,831
“One single misstep, and I will not hesitate

4418
02:49:22,831 --> 02:49:26,417
“to carve that head from your body 
in the name of Bahamut.

4419
02:49:26,417 --> 02:49:28,591
ORION: I'm sorry. Do you mean like dancing?

4420
02:49:28,591 --> 02:49:32,873
TRAVIS: I will help you do that if he missteps.

4421
02:49:32,873 --> 02:49:35,623
MATT: Clarota, hands still crossed,

4422
02:49:35,623 --> 02:49:38,235
takes a step down the stairs towards her.

4423
02:49:38,235 --> 02:49:41,852
Its tendrils in its mouth kind of-- (slurping SFX)

4424
02:49:41,852 --> 02:49:45,536
(breathy voice) “And please, understand,

4425
02:49:45,536 --> 02:49:51,163
“if you ever intend to try and cut my life short,

4426
02:49:51,163 --> 02:49:59,499
“I will also not hesitate to bore that 
beautiful mind from your skull.”

4427
02:49:59,499 --> 02:50:04,028
LIAM: Once we murder this K'Varn, 
you guys are going to laugh so hard.

4428
02:50:04,028 --> 02:50:05,872
LAURA &amp; MATT: (laugh)

4429
02:50:05,872 --> 02:50:07,035
SAM: So friends then?

4430
02:50:07,035 --> 02:50:08,166
ORION: Allies, allies.

4431
02:50:08,166 --> 02:50:09,493
TRAVIS: Allies, allies.
LAURA: Allies?

4432
02:50:09,493 --> 02:50:11,472
TALIESIN: I suppose everybody understands 
everyone now.

4433
02:50:11,472 --> 02:50:13,132
ORION: Allies. Clarota likes allies.

4434
02:50:13,132 --> 02:50:14,222
LAURA: Good times.

4435
02:50:14,222 --> 02:50:15,429
LIAM: The enemy of my enemy...

4436
02:50:15,429 --> 02:50:17,072
ORION: Is...
LAURA: Is my...

4437
02:50:17,072 --> 02:50:19,934
SAM: Has mind-sucking tentacles.

4438
02:50:19,934 --> 02:50:21,357
MATT: She looks back at the rest of you

4439
02:50:21,357 --> 02:50:23,642
and gives you all an understanding look and a nod

4440
02:50:23,642 --> 02:50:25,125
and she says,

4441
02:50:25,125 --> 02:50:30,720
“I pray that you are right. I pray that you're honest

4442
02:50:30,720 --> 02:50:35,191
“and I pray that through some strange will of the gods,

4443
02:50:35,191 --> 02:50:37,705
“this entity is telling the truth.

4444
02:50:37,705 --> 02:50:42,871
“Because if it's not, none of us will make 
it out of here alive.”

4445
02:50:42,871 --> 02:50:47,656
LIAM: We're playing a game of chess here, 
Kima, and we will win.

4446
02:50:47,656 --> 02:50:49,007
LAURA: I whisper in her ear:

4447
02:50:49,007 --> 02:50:51,936
“I would have chosen you.”

4448
02:50:51,936 --> 02:50:54,208
SAM: And I start humming 'Kumbaya'.

4449
02:50:54,208 --> 02:50:56,404
(all laughing)

4450
02:50:56,404 --> 02:50:58,582
SAM (singing softly): Kumbaya, my lord. Kumbaya.

4451
02:50:58,582 --> 02:51:00,917
ORION: I take the dagger and make a happy face of fire.

4452
02:51:00,917 --> 02:51:03,649
MATT: She doesn't notice this, as she steps 
up the stairs towards Clarota.

4453
02:51:03,649 --> 02:51:04,874
LAURA: Oh god. Okay.

4454
02:51:04,874 --> 02:51:07,172
MATT: Clarota steps back, hands up in front, this little spark

4455
02:51:07,172 --> 02:51:09,803
of arcane energy forming in his hands.

4456
02:51:09,803 --> 02:51:12,202
Clarota [sic], bringing the sword up in front of her,

4457
02:51:12,202 --> 02:51:15,106
pushes Clarota aside and continues ascending

4458
02:51:15,106 --> 02:51:17,237
back up the stairs to the first level.

4459
02:51:17,237 --> 02:51:18,444
(offscreen thump)

4460
02:51:18,444 --> 02:51:19,911
MATT: --To the first level.

4461
02:51:19,911 --> 02:51:20,877
(all laugh)

4462
02:51:20,877 --> 02:51:22,766
ORION: Killing two guards on the way.

4463
02:51:22,766 --> 02:51:25,339
MATT: Clarota puts the hands folded back together.

4464
02:51:25,339 --> 02:51:28,803
(unimpressed huff) (breathy voice) “Shall we?”

4465
02:51:28,803 --> 02:51:31,844
And walks up the stairs after her.

4466
02:51:31,844 --> 02:51:34,230
And you all begin to ascend back onto the first floor

4467
02:51:34,230 --> 02:51:36,062
and that’s where we’ll end the game for this evening.

4468
02:51:36,062 --> 02:51:37,864
(Multiple groans and exclamations)

4469
02:51:37,864 --> 02:51:39,634
MARISHA: What? No. What time is it?
I thought we just got started?

4470
02:51:39,634 --> 02:51:40,784
TRAVIS: I thought we were going to have to pick.

4471
02:51:40,784 --> 02:51:41,817
We got like ten more minutes!

4472
02:51:41,817 --> 02:51:43,002
MARISHA: Yeah, we have ten more minutes.
SAM: No, no, no. That's fine, that's fine.

4473
02:51:43,002 --> 02:51:44,429
LAURA: No, yeah, that is a good place,
or we're going to get in a battle.

4474
02:51:44,429 --> 02:51:46,521
MATT: (chuckles) Depending on where 
you guys are going next

4475
02:51:46,521 --> 02:51:49,020
it could be a bit of a lengthy encounter, so...

4476
02:51:49,020 --> 02:51:49,987
LAURA: Oh god.

4477
02:51:49,987 --> 02:51:51,785
LIAM: So the building is empty.

4478
02:51:51,785 --> 02:51:53,053
MATT: It's totally empty.

4479
02:51:53,053 --> 02:51:54,105
LAURA: Completely empty.

4480
02:51:54,105 --> 02:51:55,638
LIAM: There's ghouls everywhere.

4481
02:51:55,638 --> 02:51:57,161
MATT: There’s nobody in there.
No one has any idea that you're here.

4482
02:51:57,161 --> 02:51:58,604
TRAVIS: Wait, show of hands, if we have to pick

4483
02:51:58,604 --> 02:51:59,913
between one or the other, who's picking Kima?

4484
02:51:59,913 --> 02:52:00,791
ORION: Oh, Kima?

4485
02:52:00,791 --> 02:52:02,829
TRAVIS: Who's picking turtle-face?

4486
02:52:02,829 --> 02:52:04,234
LIAM: I don't know.

4487
02:52:04,234 --> 02:52:05,811
ORION: She's Allura's friend, right?

4488
02:52:05,811 --> 02:52:07,145
TRAVIS: We're going to throw down, this is gonna be

4489
02:52:07,145 --> 02:52:07,877
Marvel versus DC in this bitch.

4490
02:52:07,877 --> 02:52:08,797
LAURA: She's Allura's friend, she's good!

4491
02:52:08,797 --> 02:52:09,826
LIAM: Undecided, I don't know.

4492
02:52:09,826 --> 02:52:10,646
LAURA: Would you pick Kima?

4493
02:52:10,646 --> 02:52:11,773
TRAVIS: Yeah!

4494
02:52:11,773 --> 02:52:12,748
LAURA: Okay, yeah.

4495
02:52:12,748 --> 02:52:14,544
SAM: You just want her because she's badass

4496
02:52:14,544 --> 02:52:16,115
and you could hump her.

4497
02:52:16,115 --> 02:52:16,970
TRAVIS: Yeah!

4498
02:52:16,970 --> 02:52:17,727
(all laugh)

4499
02:52:17,727 --> 02:52:18,687
MATT: Oh, Grog.

4500
02:52:18,687 --> 02:52:19,880
LAURA: That would be the most awkward humping ever.

4501
02:52:19,880 --> 02:52:21,008
ORION: That's a good idea. Grog!

4502
02:52:21,008 --> 02:52:21,898
You can go hump, I can get Allura.

4503
02:52:21,898 --> 02:52:22,859
LIAM: She can hump your leg.

4504
02:52:22,859 --> 02:52:23,828
TRAVIS: Did you see her work in that room of blood?

4505
02:52:23,828 --> 02:52:25,463
TALIESIN: Only one of them is demanding that 
I become a liar.

4506
02:52:25,463 --> 02:52:27,135
MARISHA: Isn't Kima a dwarf?

4507
02:52:27,135 --> 02:52:28,548
MATT: No, Kima is a halfling.

4508
02:52:28,548 --> 02:52:29,977
LAURA: Kima is a halfling.
MARISHA: Halfling?

4509
02:52:29,977 --> 02:52:31,088
LIAM: She's a ropy, muscular, halfling.

4510
02:52:31,088 --> 02:52:33,521
ASHLEY: Wait, dang it! I wanted to 
take some torture weapons!

4511
02:52:33,521 --> 02:52:35,050
MATT: You can go back if you want to.

4512
02:52:35,050 --> 02:52:36,608
ASHLEY: Yeah, can I go back since we have ten minutes

4513
02:52:36,608 --> 02:52:37,956
and go get some torture weapons?

4514
02:52:37,956 --> 02:52:39,077
LIAM: What's it for?!

4515
02:52:39,077 --> 02:52:40,377
(all laugh)

4516
02:52:40,377 --> 02:52:41,560
MATT: This would be pretty quick, you have

4517
02:52:41,560 --> 02:52:42,855
to grab some things as everyone 
is heading up the stairs.

4518
02:52:42,855 --> 02:52:44,506
LIAM: Who's your deity? Harvey Keitel?

4519
02:52:44,506 --> 02:52:45,570
(More laughing)

4520
02:52:45,570 --> 02:52:47,048
ASHLEY: No! Just for Grog!

4521
02:52:47,048 --> 02:52:49,169
MATT: So, Pike, the war priest, however,

4522
02:52:49,169 --> 02:52:53,576
who the light of Sarenrae has guided 
her through her life,

4523
02:52:53,576 --> 02:52:57,259
once a gifted being of light and joy,

4524
02:52:57,259 --> 02:52:59,444
upon coming to the edge of death,

4525
02:52:59,444 --> 02:53:01,242
her soul taken from her form and returned,

4526
02:53:01,242 --> 02:53:03,427
going at sea and traveling with some of the more

4527
02:53:03,427 --> 02:53:05,859
rough and tumble folks of the landscape,

4528
02:53:05,859 --> 02:53:09,482
has returned now with her mind bent 
on war, vengeance--

4529
02:53:09,482 --> 02:53:10,821
TRAVIS: Yeah!

4530
02:53:10,821 --> 02:53:12,626
MATT: --and what it means to win a battle,

4531
02:53:12,626 --> 02:53:14,768
through force if necessary.

4532
02:53:14,768 --> 02:53:18,495
Watching Pike rush off and going to gather up

4533
02:53:18,495 --> 02:53:22,168
what appear to be two large, bladed hooks--

4534
02:53:22,168 --> 02:53:23,649
ASHLEY: (hissing)

4535
02:53:23,649 --> 02:53:27,156
MATT: .--a lengthy hand-razor--

4536
02:53:27,156 --> 02:53:29,315
TALIESIN: Nice.

4537
02:53:29,315 --> 02:53:32,208
ASHLEY: Okay, wait, hold on. Lengthy hand-razor...

4538
02:53:32,208 --> 02:53:33,809
MARISHA: You're going to go Sweeney Todd 
all up in this shit.

4539
02:53:33,809 --> 02:53:35,230
LAURA: (mimicking Ashley) Hold on, hold on. 
Lengthy hand-razor.

4540
02:53:35,230 --> 02:53:36,205
(More laughter)

4541
02:53:36,205 --> 02:53:37,843
LIAM: A Milli Vanilli album, and...

4542
02:53:37,843 --> 02:53:39,007
ASHLEY: Wait, what was the first one?

4543
02:53:39,007 --> 02:53:41,474
MATT: Two large, pointed hooks that are 
about two feet in length.

4544
02:53:41,474 --> 02:53:42,862
Almost like a bladed jai alai.

4545
02:53:42,862 --> 02:53:43,953
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4546
02:53:43,953 --> 02:53:49,623
MATT: And you gather a small bag of various instruments

4547
02:53:49,623 --> 02:53:50,821
that are rusty and nasty.

4548
02:53:50,821 --> 02:53:51,802
LAURA: Ew.

4549
02:53:51,802 --> 02:53:53,789
MATT: There is just some leather pouch and 
you put that in your bag.

4550
02:53:53,789 --> 02:53:56,139
It's all you have time to grab before you 
have to bolt back up to get to the rest.

4551
02:53:56,139 --> 02:53:57,314
TALIESIN: (swishing SFX)

4552
02:53:57,314 --> 02:53:58,563
MATT: And we'll pick up the next game as you guys

4553
02:53:58,563 --> 02:53:59,854
head up the stairs back into the hallway

4554
02:53:59,854 --> 02:54:03,642
you first entered in the center of the 
Emberhold duergar stronghold,

4555
02:54:03,642 --> 02:54:08,438
Lady Kima released and a very tentative alliance.

4556
02:54:08,438 --> 02:54:10,341
So, thank you guys all for watching.

4557
02:54:10,341 --> 02:54:11,604
ASHLEY: Whoo!

4558
02:54:11,604 --> 02:54:14,139
MARISHA: Pain in the ass, Lady Kima. Pain in my ass.

4559
02:54:14,139 --> 02:54:15,307
LAURA: Hey.

4560
02:54:15,307 --> 02:54:16,643
ZAC: Oh hey.

4561
02:54:16,643 --> 02:54:17,531
MATT: Hello, Zac!

4562
02:54:17,531 --> 02:54:18,912
ZAC: I was doing my little pop-ins here.

4563
02:54:18,912 --> 02:54:19,771
MATT: Yeah.

4564
02:54:19,771 --> 02:54:22,121
ZAC: So we had some donations to the charity.

4565
02:54:22,121 --> 02:54:23,240
MATT: Oh, that's awesome!

4566
02:54:23,240 --> 02:54:24,142
LAURA: Really?

4567
02:54:24,142 --> 02:54:25,041
MARISHA: Yeah!

4568
02:54:25,041 --> 02:54:26,051
MARISHA: Thanks guys.

4569
02:54:26,051 --> 02:54:28,098
ZAC: I have really terrible handwriting, so...

4570
02:54:28,098 --> 02:54:30,574
So I wrote these myself and I'm supposed to read them and...

4571
02:54:30,574 --> 02:54:31,715
MATT: Right, right, that's okay.

4572
02:54:31,715 --> 02:54:34,068
ZAC: TheConman93.

4573
02:54:34,068 --> 02:54:35,474
MATT: Conman93, thank you!

4574
02:54:35,474 --> 02:54:37,765
ZAC: ...Marilyn?

4575
02:54:37,765 --> 02:54:39,169
MATT: Marilyn, thank you!

4576
02:54:39,169 --> 02:54:41,956
ZAC: A123Junior.

4577
02:54:41,956 --> 02:54:45,210
MATT: A123Junior, appreciate it, buddy.

4578
02:54:45,210 --> 02:54:46,821
ZAC: Poltergeist123.

4579
02:54:46,821 --> 02:54:50,585
MATT: Poltergeist123, yeah. All good movies. First two.

4580
02:54:50,585 --> 02:54:53,687
ZAC: Almsnuffufin... Um, Eon? Something?

4581
02:54:53,687 --> 02:54:55,625
MATT: Yeah MisnurMenfrishunsen.

4582
02:54:55,625 --> 02:54:57,106
ZAC: AxisOfAnarchy...

4583
02:54:57,106 --> 02:54:58,039
MATT: Thank you. Nice, Axis.

4584
02:54:58,039 --> 02:54:59,499
ZAC: RuzGofDi.

4585
02:54:59,499 --> 02:55:02,125
MATT: RuzGofDi! Thank you guys so much for donating! 
Really appreciate it.

4586
02:55:02,125 --> 02:55:05,720
ZAC: Give to charity. Thank you.

4587
02:55:05,720 --> 02:55:06,926
MATT: Thank you, guys.

4588
02:55:06,926 --> 02:55:09,621
ZAC: So thank you guys for tuning in tonight

4589
02:55:09,621 --> 02:55:11,600
and for all you front page viewers.

4590
02:55:11,600 --> 02:55:16,049
We stream 6 to 7 hours 5 to 6 days a week.

4591
02:55:16,049 --> 02:55:19,338
We do a lot of varied programming, 
from comic book shows

4592
02:55:19,338 --> 02:55:23,803
to tabletop gaming to Steam group 
games, indie gaming.

4593
02:55:23,803 --> 02:55:25,554
All sorts of fun stuff.

4594
02:55:25,554 --> 02:55:28,955
Every Friday night we have live music and 
bands play and stuff.

4595
02:55:28,955 --> 02:55:30,066
LAURA: Nice!

4596
02:55:30,066 --> 02:55:31,785
ZAC: And tomorrow we're having a special party to celebrate

4597
02:55:31,785 --> 02:55:34,060
our reaching 2000 subscribers.

4598
02:55:34,060 --> 02:55:36,138
MATT: Yeah. That's awesome.

4599
02:55:36,138 --> 02:55:37,242
(Cheering and clapping)

4600
02:55:37,242 --> 02:55:38,363
ZAC: You guys are all welcome to stop by.

4601
02:55:38,363 --> 02:55:39,656
MATT: We might just do that. Awesome.

4602
02:55:39,656 --> 02:55:40,622
ZAC: It's from 7 to 9 we'll have a band playing,

4603
02:55:40,622 --> 02:55:41,763
we're gonna do some fun group games.

4604
02:55:41,763 --> 02:55:44,226
Probably play some inappropriate 
Cards Against Humanity.

4605
02:55:44,226 --> 02:55:45,727
And Super Fight and stuff like that.

4606
02:55:45,727 --> 02:55:48,138
MATT: As if there was appropriate 
Cards Against Humanity.

4607
02:55:48,138 --> 02:55:49,806
ZAC: Every time I break it out, I'm like, 
I should never do this.

4608
02:55:49,806 --> 02:55:51,143
(all laugh)

4609
02:55:51,143 --> 02:55:52,386
MATT: I know. It's part of the fun.

4610
02:55:52,386 --> 02:55:55,578
And we're every Thursday, 7 o'clock, 
7PM Pacific Standard Time.

4611
02:55:55,578 --> 02:55:58,705
Usually we run about 2 and a half, 3 hours, 
our game sessions.

4612
02:55:58,705 --> 02:56:01,527
So please come watch every Thursday. 
We love to have you guys.

4613
02:56:01,527 --> 02:56:04,713
ZAC: And for Team Hooman tomorrow 
is Ify Appreciation Day.

4614
02:56:04,713 --> 02:56:08,246
So if you guys want to get on that.

4615
02:56:08,246 --> 02:56:12,811
And for those that know Ify as sholfboys 
and not much else,

4616
02:56:12,811 --> 02:56:17,067
Ify is a really prominent figure in 
the local comedy scene

4617
02:56:17,067 --> 02:56:21,144
and he does a lot of work on shows like Key &amp; Peele,

4618
02:56:21,144 --> 02:56:23,112
Comedy Bang! Bang!, stuff like that.

4619
02:56:23,112 --> 02:56:24,342
He's a really talented dude.

4620
02:56:24,342 --> 02:56:26,678
You should look him up before you write those tweets

4621
02:56:26,678 --> 02:56:28,846
just so you know more of what he's about.

4622
02:56:28,846 --> 02:56:32,336
And we are going to throw that dropcam up 
and set up for dancing.

4623
02:56:32,336 --> 02:56:34,667
If any of you want to stay, you're welcome to.

4624
02:56:34,667 --> 02:56:36,879
If not, you're welcome to leave. 
No one is going to force you,

4625
02:56:36,879 --> 02:56:38,534
except chatroom now that I brought it up.

4626
02:56:38,534 --> 02:56:40,221
(all laugh)

4627
02:56:40,221 --> 02:56:41,281
ASHLEY: I mean, it's a good workout after all this food.

4628
02:56:41,281 --> 02:56:42,521
ZAC: You burn some calories after all that chicken, right?

4629
02:56:42,521 --> 02:56:43,355
ASHLEY: Burn some calories...

4630
02:56:43,355 --> 02:56:44,101
LAURA: Right, right.

4631
02:56:44,101 --> 02:56:44,824
MATT: Exactly.

4632
02:56:44,824 --> 02:56:46,131
ZAC: We are, I think, 20 away from a giveaway.

4633
02:56:46,131 --> 02:56:48,902
So as long as we're live, the giveaway counts.

4634
02:56:48,902 --> 02:56:49,963
TRAVIS: Is valid.

4635
02:56:49,963 --> 02:56:50,705
