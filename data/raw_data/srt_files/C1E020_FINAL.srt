00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,669
MATT: Hello, and welcome this evening to Critical
Role, everyone. A show where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,705 --> 00:00:09,600
nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons
and have a good time. Guess we can go ahead and--

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,590
we forgot to do the format this time and start
with the intro. We trying to do that going forward

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,113
because it makes more sense. But for now, let's go
ahead and jump to the intro and we'll be right

5
00:00:17,113 --> 00:00:20,276
back to describe what we have going on.

6
00:00:20,276 --> 00:01:27,176
[dramatic music]

7
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,787
MATT: Welcome back. So first and foremost, we got
a couple quick announcements to get into for this

8
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:36,926
week. For every 100 subs we get to the channel
this evening we'll be doing giveaways. The

9
00:01:36,926 --> 00:01:42,397
giveaways this week will include a signed photo of
the cast of Critical Role, as well as, for the

10
00:01:42,397 --> 00:01:48,409
first time offering, a large print poster of one
of the classic moments within our campaign drawn

11
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:53,002
by our illustrious Kit Buss, our official artist
for Critical Role. I think Zac should be showing

12
00:01:53,002 --> 00:01:55,865
you that photo that we'll be giving away, a really
nice, high-quality print of that signed by the

13
00:01:55,865 --> 00:02:03,515
cast. And we'll send that out to whoever wins the
wonderful prize for the chat room. I think we're

14
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:09,019
50 away from our first giveaway. So, you got to
get that climbing so we can give that out shortly.

15
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:15,172
Also, as we've previously, the past two weeks, had
some great guests joining our first half of the

16
00:02:15,172 --> 00:02:19,713
Vox Machina group on their adventure, this week we
have two new guests joining us for this and next

17
00:02:19,713 --> 00:02:24,251
week. If I can have a big, warm welcome to our
players this week: Wil Wheaton and Will Friedle.

18
00:02:24,251 --> 00:02:29,084
Thank you guys so much for joining us. Excited to
have you.

19
00:02:29,084 --> 00:02:30,274
MARISHA: So awesome.

20
00:02:30,274 --> 00:02:31,588
WILL: Slightly nervous.

21
00:02:31,588 --> 00:02:36,670
WIL: You're going to be great, don't worry about
it. I want to apologize in advance to Liam for

22
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,903
having to share a table with me. I'm sorry for
what's going to happen to your dice on account of

23
00:02:40,903 --> 00:02:47,767
how close we are to each other. I hope you're not
too attached to anything

24
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,589
with your character at all.

25
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:51,356
(laughter)

26
00:02:51,356 --> 00:02:56,413
WIL: I know. I'm just telling you, if there's dice
you really love, you might want to put them away.

27
00:02:56,413 --> 00:02:59,165
LIAM: I'll just kiester this one.

28
00:02:59,165 --> 00:03:05,047
MATT: That's the most comfortable way to do that.
Well, awesome guys. Thank you so much for joining

29
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:10,432
us in this. Before we jump in, let's see if we
have any announcements that anyone wants to make,

30
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:16,394
anything coming up, anything you want to talk
about. I'll start. I'll say that as of flying out

31
00:03:16,394 --> 00:03:20,058
this evening, I should say, I have a flight at
12:15 from LAX. I'll be flying out to Columbus,

32
00:03:20,058 --> 00:03:24,847
Ohio for Matsuricon this weekend. So, any of you
guys out there in the Ohio area want to come and

33
00:03:24,847 --> 00:03:29,333
visit me for the weekend, I'll be doing signings,
panels, and general hanging out with fans and

34
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:34,555
stuff. So if you're in the vicinity, come say hi.
That's my announcement. Anyone else have anything

35
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:35,668
they want to mention?

36
00:03:35,668 --> 00:03:41,188
ORION: Yeah. I recently started my own Twitch
stream. So you can follow me and watch. I play a

37
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:47,265
lot of video games, guys. It's horrible addiction
that's amazing. But it's @orionacaba on Twitch.

38
00:03:47,265 --> 00:03:50,951
MATT: You keep streaming Thursdays at 7:00, which
I think is really counterproductive.

39
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:52,591
ORION: It's weird.

40
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:57,888
WIL: When you've mastered being in two places at
once, it's silly not to take advantage of it.

41
00:03:57,888 --> 00:04:04,283
ORION: I am actually hosting Geek and Sundry on my
channel right now.

42
00:04:04,283 --> 00:04:05,633
MATT: Oh, look at you.

43
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:08,601
LIAM: Are you simultaneously brewing at home right
now?

44
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:12,669
WIL: I am. And I am also running this game in
an alternate universe.

45
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,813
LIAM: Oh. Wow.

46
00:04:14,937 --> 00:04:24,049
WIL: It's pretty great. Yeah. And Matt rolls so
bad in that game. It's really great. I am having

47
00:04:24,156 --> 00:04:29,285
dinner with my wife tomorrow so I'm looking
forward to that. We're probably going to put a

48
00:04:29,285 --> 00:04:35,617
whole chicken in the smoker in the afternoon and
then I think we're going to play some games. I'm

49
00:04:35,617 --> 00:04:38,461
introducing her to a game that I got at Gen Con
called Lanterns.

50
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:39,763
MARISHA: Lanterns?

51
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:42,039
WIL: Yeah, really fun Dom Lux game. Really like it
a lot.

52
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:43,808
MARISHA: We'll have to check that out.

53
00:04:43,808 --> 00:04:48,043
WILL: I, after four lovely years, popped the
question last week.

54
00:04:48,043 --> 00:04:49,615
MATT: Yes, you did.

55
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:51,407
WILL: And I am engaged to be married. Yes.

56
00:04:51,407 --> 00:04:53,263
(cheering)

57
00:04:53,263 --> 00:04:54,907
WILL: Thank you very much.

58
00:04:54,907 --> 00:04:58,495
MATT: I would say Susan's a very lucky girl, but
really, it's the other way around.

59
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,140
WILL: No, I'm the lucky one. I lucked out. I
really was the one who lucked out.

60
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,268
LIAM: Does she know or is this the proposal?

61
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:08,092
WILL: I was going to propose like this, but we
live in the woods and we don't get this show

62
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:13,653
there. We have no internet whatsoever. No, she
knows. She knows. She stupidly said yes, so we'll

63
00:05:13,653 --> 00:05:15,426
see what happens next.

64
00:05:15,426 --> 00:05:19,812
WIL: If you need an entree into the Society of Men
Who Married Way Above Their Stations, I can

65
00:05:19,812 --> 00:05:21,225
provide you an introduction.

66
00:05:21,225 --> 00:05:28,137
WILL: Thank you. (laughs) That's awesome. Yes,
that is absolutely what happened here, so I will

67
00:05:28,137 --> 00:05:28,938
need that.

68
00:05:28,938 --> 00:05:30,959
WIL: Yeah, they're members-only jackets.

69
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,374
MARISHA: Members-only jackets.

70
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:39,239
WIL: The sleeves are little too short on all of
the jackets, so we remember.

71
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,849
WILL: That's perfect. I like that.

72
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:42,415
MATT: A lot of suede.

73
00:05:42,415 --> 00:05:44,034
WILL and WIL: Yeah.

74
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:45,689
(laughter)

75
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:48,990
WIL: And a nylon hood zipped into the neck, for
some reason.

76
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,906
MATT: Which no one ever uses, and you forget it's
there until you're like, "What's that? Oh, right."

77
00:05:51,906 --> 00:05:53,446
Congratulations.

78
00:05:53,446 --> 00:05:56,336
WILL: Thank you. You are the first to know that
that's happened.

79
00:05:56,336 --> 00:06:02,999
MATT: There you go. Exclusive. Critical Role
exclusive. Well, fantastic. Let's go ahead and

80
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:05,352
jump into where we left off.

81
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:09,135
WIL: I thought I just heard you say you need a
pencil.

82
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,373
ORION: Yeah, I do.

83
00:06:10,373 --> 00:06:14,078
WILL: That's what happens when you're in multiple
places at once. The realities start blending.

84
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:15,797
WILL: I'll share, if you'd like.

85
00:06:15,797 --> 00:06:17,215
ORION: Thank you.

86
00:06:17,215 --> 00:06:19,640
MATT: Anyone else need a pencil? Everyone good?

87
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,229
WILL: That was a good throw and catch.

88
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:23,478
WIL: I have a mechanical pencil that looks like a
pencil pencil.

89
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:28,314
WILL: I think I have the same kind of pencil.

90
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:29,792
WIL: Yeah, it's nice.

91
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:31,897
MARISHA: We do the hand-eye coordination thing.

92
00:06:31,897 --> 00:06:38,716
MATT: All righty, guys. As it currently stands,
Vox Machina throughout its ventures found itself

93
00:06:38,716 --> 00:06:45,119
in the city of Vasselheim, as of late. They came
to seal away the Horn of Orcus they had tore from

94
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:49,345
the head of the beholder K'Varn deep in the
Underdark. Once they had completed this journey,

95
00:06:49,345 --> 00:06:56,460
they spent some time in the city trying to figure
out what can be done there, preparation for

96
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:04,498
possibly Keyleth making a venture out to one of her
Ashari tribes. During which, Grog entered a fight

97
00:07:04,498 --> 00:07:07,977
ring and lost. And the party decided to go ahead
and--

98
00:07:07,977 --> 00:07:09,427
MARISHA: Never forget.

99
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:13,747
MATT: I have a feeling Kern and Grog are going to
have a round two in the near future, depending on

100
00:07:13,747 --> 00:07:18,612
how Grog's feeling about that. Then the party saw
that there was some sort of hydra-like being that had

101
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:23,063
been harrying the walls of the outskirts of the
city of Vasselheim. Being the adventurers they

102
00:07:23,063 --> 00:07:27,227
are, they took it upon themselves to leap out into
the jungles and the forests of the Vesper

103
00:07:27,227 --> 00:07:34,797
Timberland. Found and hunted down this hydra,
fought it, and upon slaying it, discovered there

104
00:07:34,797 --> 00:07:39,067
was another group also hunting this hydra. An
actually sanctioned group. And that hunting this

105
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:41,847
hydra is considered illegal in 
Vasselheim unless you had actually been contracted to

106
00:07:41,887 --> 00:07:47,885
do so. So in breaking the laws of Vasselheim, they
could have been tried for it, but instead chose to

107
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:53,470
return to the city with this group of hunters and
be brought before their guildmaster, the

108
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:59,454
Huntmaster known as Huntmaster Vanessa Cyndrial.
Basically, they were given the choice: they could

109
00:07:59,454 --> 00:08:04,409
go to trial or they could undergo their own
personal trial to join the guild, the Slayer's

110
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:10,163
Take, which is essentially a guild that takes on
contracts to hunt various requested creatures

111
00:08:10,163 --> 00:08:16,206
down, harvest elements of their physical bodies to
then be sold or returned to these individuals and

112
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:21,120
be paid for it. If they manage to complete these
trials, they will be absolved of breaking the law

113
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,172
because they will now be within the confines of it
and will be members of the guild. So choosing

114
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:30,045
that, they were then also notified that they would
be splitting up into two different groups, much to

115
00:08:30,045 --> 00:08:32,481
the chagrin of Vex and Vax, our twins.

116
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:36,070
WILL: Split apart.

117
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,550
LIAM: Separation anxiety is a real thing.

118
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:48,795
MATT: So this group, the second adventuring group,
has gathered itself back to the Bellows' Respite

119
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:56,517
inn. Vax, you were asked to go the bar, to join
your sister, Vex, for a shot of the hardest liquor

120
00:08:56,517 --> 00:09:01,652
they had available to deal with the coming
separation. You shared a brief breakfast, shared

121
00:09:01,652 --> 00:09:09,394
your bitter, spiteful, alcoholic imbibement, and
then went your separate ways. The first group went

122
00:09:09,394 --> 00:09:14,719
initially, and it's been about an hour or so of
you guys waiting in the tavern for them to, as far

123
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:17,919
as you know, take care of their business before you
were to go to the guild yourselves. So, we have

124
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:24,974
Tiberius, Keyleth, and Vax all sitting around the
Bellows' Respite tavern lamenting what's going to

125
00:09:24,974 --> 00:09:26,458
come next.

126
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:33,499
ORION: Oh, cheer up, Vax. She'll be back soon.
I've never seen you quite so down.

127
00:09:33,499 --> 00:09:38,088
MARISHA: I've been separated from my parents for a
really long time. You get used to it.

128
00:09:38,088 --> 00:09:39,458
It's not too bad.

129
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:45,527
LIAM: It took you years to do that. I'm two
minutes in, so I'll grieve a little bit longer.

130
00:09:45,527 --> 00:09:49,633
MARISHA: Don't say the word grieve. That's
strong.

131
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:55,159
ORION: Yes, it's implying that someone has died.
And no one has. So, you know.

132
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:58,459
MARISHA: It's only a few days. It'll be good.
Separation makes the heart grow fonder and all

133
00:09:58,459 --> 00:09:59,427
that stuff.

134
00:09:59,427 --> 00:10:03,032
LIAM: It's fine. I just have a low tolerance for
bullshit, and I'd like to get past this little

135
00:10:03,032 --> 00:10:07,507
piece of shit that we're being made to swallow.

136
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:16,152
ORION: I agree. Stormwinds should not be meddling
around with these peasants. Are we in a tavern?

137
00:10:16,152 --> 00:10:18,501
MATT: You are currently in the Bellows' Respite
Tavern.

138
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:25,028
ORION: Barkeep, bring me your finest ale for my
friend here and for the lady. I'll take a water.

139
00:10:25,028 --> 00:10:32,066
MATT: The relatively jovial, ginger-bearded,
rotund human gentleman who runs the establishment

140
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:36,368
comes over to you. Looks like himself is a little
bleary-eyed and hasn't quite adjusted to the

141
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:42,213
morning light itself. "Oh okay. Certainly, I'll go
ahead and retrieve that for you. It's three? Three

142
00:10:42,262 --> 00:10:43,643
"is what I'm looking at?"

143
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,913
MARISHA: What time is it?

144
00:10:44,913 --> 00:10:47,922
MATT: Right now, I'd say it's roughly 9:00 to
10:00 in the morning.

145
00:10:47,922 --> 00:10:53,011
MARISHA: Oh sure. Let's start early. Why not?

146
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:57,810
ORION: And I flip him a couple of gold coins.

147
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,459
MATT: He tries to catch it, fumbles. Goes and pick
it up.

148
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,785
MARISHA: Don't throw. That's rude.

149
00:11:02,785 --> 00:11:11,859
MATT: Five minutes go by. Your food and drink are
brought to your table, and you continue to lament

150
00:11:11,859 --> 00:11:17,821
about the coming time. Is there anything else you
guys wish to take care of before you make

151
00:11:17,821 --> 00:11:19,892
your way to the Slayer's Take Guildhall?

152
00:11:19,892 --> 00:11:26,153
MARISHA: Well, since we're getting separated, Grog
is taking the Bag of Holding.

153
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,469
ORION: I have one; don't forget that.

154
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:33,022
MARISHA: Right, but we had a lot of stuff in that
Bag of Holding. I kept most of the stuff that I

155
00:11:33,022 --> 00:11:37,150
needed on me, but how many healing potions do we
have?

156
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:41,258
LIAM: Not a lot. That's what I'm concerned about.
We lost our meat shield and we don't have Pike. So

157
00:11:41,258 --> 00:11:45,703
I think we probably need to go and get some
potions.

158
00:11:45,703 --> 00:11:51,106
MARISHA: I can go ahead and brush up on healing
spells, as well. Make sure I come a little bit

159
00:11:51,106 --> 00:11:53,357
more well-equipped, just in case.

160
00:11:53,357 --> 00:11:57,164
ORION: I'm good on potions, but we should restock
our supply.

161
00:11:57,164 --> 00:11:58,644
LIAM: How many have you got?

162
00:11:58,644 --> 00:12:04,056
ORION: I have, let me see here, three potions of
greater healing, and three

163
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,740
regular potions of healing.

164
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,026
LIAM: Can I have one?

165
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:10,618
ORION: I suppose. If we're just going to buy more,
it doesn't matter. But just in case something

166
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:11,893
happens along the way.

167
00:12:11,893 --> 00:12:13,259
LIAM: Thank you.

168
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:15,546
MARISHA: I only have one greater healing potion
right now.

169
00:12:15,546 --> 00:12:20,558
ORION: Yes, so we'll go buy more. And then we'll
see what else they have. I would like to see if we

170
00:12:20,558 --> 00:12:26,722
can procure a couple of items, like a couple of
empty vials. I've used a lot of mine. Maybe find

171
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:31,102
some acid or whatnot at these item shops. So let's
look around and get the stuff.

172
00:12:31,102 --> 00:12:32,120
MARISHA: Okay.

173
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,312
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an investigation
check.

174
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:39,353
MARISHA: Apparently we have the flying carpet?

175
00:12:39,353 --> 00:12:41,996
LIAM: Do we have the flying carpet?

176
00:12:41,996 --> 00:12:49,152
MATT: The flying carpet is, for the most part,
kept wrapped up in Grog's Bag of Holding.

177
00:12:49,152 --> 00:12:57,263
MARISHA: Because I think Grog was checking out.
He's breaking up a little bit. But I feel like he

178
00:12:57,263 --> 00:12:59,927
just told me that we took the flying carpet.

179
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:03,142
LIAM: (imitating Grog) We took the flying carpet.
Sorry.

180
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:08,448
MARISHA: He's very far away, but I feel it's
reaching its limits.

181
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:12,020
LIAM: (imitating Grog) I would like to bogart the
flying carpet and everything in the fucking Bag.

182
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,191
MARISHA: He apparently left us with the flying
carpet?

183
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:21,877
ORION: He's saying he left with the flying carpet,
Keyleth. He left with it. We don't have it.

184
00:13:21,877 --> 00:13:27,806
MARISHA: He said, remember, you took the flying
carpet. To break RP for a second.

185
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,883
LIAM: (imitating Grog) Am I texting you that right
now?

186
00:13:29,883 --> 00:13:34,677
MARISHA: Yeah. I can't. You're cutting out. You're
cutting out, Grog.

187
00:13:34,677 --> 00:13:40,378
ORION: I held it for a time, but I only have my
Wheel of Mending in mine, as far as I know. Hold

188
00:13:40,378 --> 00:13:42,249
on, let me check.

189
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:45,311
MATT: As you reach into your Bag of Holding--

190
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:47,200
ORION: I'm thinking really hard.

191
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:53,535
MATT: Through the luck of the draw, it seems to be
that the last resting place of the flying carpet

192
00:13:53,575 --> 00:13:55,072
was within your Bag of Holding.

193
00:13:55,183 --> 00:13:57,299
ORION: Hold on. Oh here it is.

194
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:03,076
MARISHA: Oh, look at that. We have it.

195
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:05,146
ORION: Shut my mouth. I guess I was wrong.

196
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:06,428
MARISHA: Found it. We're good.

197
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:10,067
LIAM: All right, let's go to the store. I don't
really want to drag this out any longer than we

198
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:12,266
have to. And I walk out the door and start going.

199
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:14,524
MATT: Okay. What did you roll for your
investigation check, Tiberius?

200
00:14:14,524 --> 00:14:15,444
ORION: 16.

201
00:14:15,444 --> 00:14:21,074
MATT: 16? Okay. As you guys take the next 20
minutes wandering the Quad Roads district of

202
00:14:21,074 --> 00:14:27,182
Vasselheim, asking around. A lot of the shops here
offer general supplies. There are a few that are

203
00:14:27,182 --> 00:14:31,637
focused on the mining supplies as there is a large
market mining cobalt out of the center of the

204
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:38,264
mountain the city is built around. You find places
that provide clockwork for large grandfather

205
00:14:38,264 --> 00:14:44,243
clocks that are starting to be distributed in this part of
the city. You also find that there is a large

206
00:14:44,286 --> 00:14:49,931
bazaar-type market in the center of the Quad Roads
that you passed by when you first came to town.

207
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:57,469
Amongst many of these barkers, you do catch one
small tent, Tiberius, that catches your eye

208
00:14:57,469 --> 00:15:04,315
because it resembles the same purple color as one
tent you guys entered in Emon about a year or so

209
00:15:04,315 --> 00:15:07,251
ago, in which you encountered a fortune teller.

210
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:15,666
MARISHA: Oh shit! It's the Witch's Fortune. What
are you looking for?

211
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,504
LIAM: Look at those fingers fly.

212
00:15:18,504 --> 00:15:20,809
ORION: I approach.

213
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:28,169
MARISHA: Do you know her name? Remember her name?
I can probably find it. It would take a minute of

214
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:39,005
digging, through. Hang on. I've got to go back to my
old notes. I've got to go back to my old D&D

215
00:15:39,056 --> 00:15:42,092
notes. Keep doing stuff.

216
00:15:42,092 --> 00:15:46,847
MATT: So as you enter the tent, you pull the
curtains apart. There is one other individual who

217
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:51,491
seems to be just perusing the interior. But the
smell that hits you immediately is very heavy

218
00:15:51,491 --> 00:16:00,556
sage, ceremonial burning of various spices, giving
the area a mystical scent. The light itself is

219
00:16:00,556 --> 00:16:04,950
very low, just a few flickering candles and a
hooded lantern in the far corner directed outward

220
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:12,215
give a bit of ambiance to the interior of the
tent. The series of small ropes and cords made of

221
00:16:12,215 --> 00:16:25,650
hemp and silk carry trinkets and bones and various
enchanted accoutrements. And in the far back

222
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:31,582
corner, amongst the table there is indeed a very
beautiful elven woman dressed in a fine silk gown

223
00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:37,623
with a metallic headband, her dirty blonde hair
behind her ears. And she looks to be in the middle

224
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:43,755
of shuffling a deck of tarot cards. As you enter,
she looks up and gives you a look of surprise and

225
00:16:43,755 --> 00:16:46,277
then a curious look of remembrance.

226
00:16:46,277 --> 00:16:47,448
MARISHA: Am I with him?

227
00:16:47,448 --> 00:16:50,348
MATT: You're behind him and outside of the tent.
He entered. Did you guys want to go in with him?

228
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:51,491
LIAM and MARISHA: Yes.

229
00:16:51,491 --> 00:16:55,317
MATT: All right, you enter and are greeted by this
same atmosphere.

230
00:16:55,317 --> 00:16:59,458
MARISHA: (gasps) Trista!

231
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,142
MATT: She gives you a cross look.

232
00:17:02,142 --> 00:17:08,182
MARISHA: It's been so long! Fancy meeting you
here.

233
00:17:08,182 --> 00:17:13,869
MATT: She puts her finger up for a second, turns
over to the noblewoman who is currently perusing

234
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:19,322
this small shelf of books and tomes. "I'm terribly
sorry. Would you mind just giving us a moment?

235
00:17:19,322 --> 00:17:22,057
"I've some personal business to attend to."

236
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:26,412
The noble woman is like, "Oh, fine. I didn't want
to purchase anything anyway." And stomps out of

237
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:29,418
the tent. The door closes behind her.

238
00:17:29,418 --> 00:17:34,220
At which point the elven woman immediately turns.
"Trista's my sister."

239
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,905
MARISHA: You're Forsythia?

240
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:43,076
MATT: "It's good to see you again, young
half-elf." You can see now with the current

241
00:17:43,076 --> 00:17:49,192
atmosphere, the light seems to dim the interior of
the tent. And the elven woman's visage shimmers

242
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:54,804
and then fades and there sitting behind the table
you see a large, hunched forward, gnarled

243
00:17:54,804 --> 00:18:02,550
humanoid. This woman, who is definitively referred
to as a hag, is currently

244
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,626
lording over the table, long, twisted fingers
holding that same deck of cards. Looking up at you

245
00:18:07,626 --> 00:18:14,390
with a crooked nose and pointed chin. There's a
grin on her face. And looks to you and, "It has

246
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:23,334
"been some time, dragonborn. I can still see there
is a fraction of you still missing."

247
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:30,155
ORION: Yes. I still don't know what that means.
But I am actually happy to see you, milady.

248
00:18:30,155 --> 00:18:36,570
MATT: Still shuffling her cards. "So was there
anything I can help you with?"

249
00:18:36,611 --> 00:18:45,796
ORION: Yes. Yes, there is. You mentioned before,
when I asked you last, of the Boros Ring. You

250
00:18:45,796 --> 00:18:56,998
revealed that it was in the Fey, the Wild Fen. I
am also in search of the item that I did not get

251
00:18:56,998 --> 00:19:03,739
to ask you about called the Pale Stone. I wish to
know the location of that, as well.

252
00:19:03,739 --> 00:19:19,219
MATT: She gives you a keen look. "I think for the
time being, one quest is enough. Return when you've

253
00:19:19,219 --> 00:19:27,678
"procured this ring you so graciously seek, then
perhaps the rest of this will be revealed. Grow

254
00:19:27,678 --> 00:19:37,068
"greedy with fate and I fear the timeline will
swallow you up, young dragonblood." She pulls the

255
00:19:37,068 --> 00:19:40,440
cards down and just starts going over her own
reading. Each card she slams down with a heavy

256
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:50,589
thud. The room seems to almost cloud, the air
growing thicker. And there's a hint of frustration

257
00:19:50,638 --> 00:19:56,231
that she's currently being bothered and strung
out. After she takes a few moments to herself, she

258
00:19:56,231 --> 00:20:02,404
looks back you. "Is there business you seek, aside
from asking me these questions? Perhaps a bauble

259
00:20:02,404 --> 00:20:05,836
"or two. I make fine baubles."

260
00:20:05,836 --> 00:20:09,550
ORION: Since you're not in the business of
information, then we are in the business of

261
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:17,794
procuring some specific items. Potions. I'm
looking for a few empty glass vials. Perhaps some

262
00:20:17,794 --> 00:20:19,186
acid, if you have it.

263
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:24,226
MATT: She stands up. And as she stands up, you can
now see the hag, which hunched forward, sits at a

264
00:20:24,226 --> 00:20:29,403
solid five feet tall. At full height, even with
the hunch, she's now cresting the top of the tent

265
00:20:29,403 --> 00:20:37,755
at seven feet. Long, stringy, gray-black hair
framing the shoulders. The same nice goldish silk

266
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:45,652
outfit the elf appearance was wearing is there. It
looks much more world-tattered and matches the one

267
00:20:45,652 --> 00:20:49,370
currently wearing it. She reaches behind her,
still staring you intently in the face, and grabs

268
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:55,670
a small case off the wall. Sets it down before
her. Pulls back the wooden lid and inside, you can

269
00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:06,255
see there are three small glass vials. "These are
what I have to offer. Two of them will right your

270
00:21:06,255 --> 00:21:13,577
"physical form, perhaps take care of some of those
wounds someone as foolish and careless as you

271
00:21:13,577 --> 00:21:26,838
"eventually deal with. The third one is caustic in its
nature. Its application is up to you. They are

272
00:21:26,838 --> 00:21:34,706
"sold as a set, though. 300 gold pieces. Take it or
leave."

273
00:21:34,706 --> 00:21:44,152
ORION: You don't have to be all nasty about it. I
have the money. Here you go.

274
00:21:44,152 --> 00:21:50,225
MATT: She reaches over and as you hold the small
bag of coin out, her hand completely engulfs

275
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:54,185
yours. The fingers wrap around, and for a second
you feel a tug. And you are awkwardly pulled

276
00:21:54,185 --> 00:21:58,835
forward a few inches. You get closer to her face.
The breath catches your nostrils, the scent of

277
00:21:58,835 --> 00:22:05,853
swamp water and old fish. It's a moment of
intensity where you forget your surroundings for a

278
00:22:05,853 --> 00:22:11,059
brief moment. And it's just you and this entity.
And you realize, she's far older than you ever

279
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:17,531
gave her credit for. She pulls the bag of coin
from your hand and withdraws. The light seems to

280
00:22:17,531 --> 00:22:24,490
return from the peripheral of your vision. Keyleth
and Vax are there at your side. She reaches

281
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:32,329
forward and pushes the box forward toward you on
the table. "Be safe, and may fortune smile upon

282
00:22:32,329 --> 00:22:33,954
"most of you."

283
00:22:33,954 --> 00:22:43,986
ORION: Yes, I know something bad is going to
happen. I show them the box. I take it and pick it

284
00:22:43,986 --> 00:22:49,920
up. This is all she had to offer. She's not taking
questions.

285
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,461
MARISHA: You're not taking any questions right
now?

286
00:22:52,461 --> 00:22:53,942
MATT: "Not today."

287
00:22:53,942 --> 00:22:55,626
MARISHA: Not today?

288
00:22:55,626 --> 00:23:02,748
MATT: "As you know, my dealings with fate take a
lot out of me. I'm not quite ready for another

289
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:10,377
"round of tellings. You see, this city, as most
bits of civilization, are very eager to hear what

290
00:23:10,377 --> 00:23:15,723
"the future has in store for them. So I'm a bit
tapped out at the moment." And you can see a

291
00:23:15,723 --> 00:23:19,815
bit of dried blood around one of her nostrils. And
if you recall last time, the process was very

292
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:28,878
physically taxing on her. "Perhaps return in a
week or so. And if I'm not here, I'm around."

293
00:23:28,918 --> 00:23:35,822
LIAM: Old one, are you still willing to trade
today?

294
00:23:35,822 --> 00:23:40,195
MATT: "Trade?"

295
00:23:40,195 --> 00:23:48,327
LIAM: I'm wondering if you have any poisons beyond
the run-of-the-mill nightshades

296
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:52,261
this afternoon or morning?

297
00:23:52,261 --> 00:24:02,863
MATT: She stands up and reaches over, and there's
a small alchemical glassware set up on the side.

298
00:24:02,863 --> 00:24:10,587
And you see it's cracked and old and it's been
brutalized. And she pulls a very small vial of

299
00:24:10,587 --> 00:24:21,854
some dark, black, almost umbra-type liquid where
you can't even see shine in the light. It absorbs all

300
00:24:21,896 --> 00:24:30,946
the light. She puts it forward. "This would be
very unfortunate to find its way into the

301
00:24:30,946 --> 00:24:33,432
"bloodstream of an enemy, yes?"

302
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:36,354
LIAM: What do you want for it?

303
00:24:36,354 --> 00:24:47,078
MATT: "A favor. Not now, but perhaps down the
road."

304
00:24:47,078 --> 00:24:49,233
ORION: She does that, Vax. A lot.

305
00:24:49,233 --> 00:24:52,591
LIAM: Why not?

306
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:59,828
MATT: She pushes it forward with her long, crooked
fingernail, shoves the vial forward. It screeches

307
00:24:59,828 --> 00:25:06,317
across the top of the table. She withdraws her
hand. "So it is done." At that moment, there's a

308
00:25:06,317 --> 00:25:13,598
very a cold shiver down the back of your neck that
then fades. She just grins with this nasty, toothy

309
00:25:13,598 --> 00:25:20,957
grin. "Now, be on your way. I have cards to
shuffle."

310
00:25:20,957 --> 00:25:23,290
LIAM: Yoink.

311
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:32,195
MARISHA: It was so nice to see a familiar face in
such a strange place. She's lovely.

312
00:25:32,195 --> 00:25:34,752
ORION: Yes. Good day, madam.

313
00:25:34,752 --> 00:25:41,616
MATT: As you step out, she raises her hand in
front of her and her form once again shimmers and

314
00:25:41,616 --> 00:25:46,673
shifts down to that beautiful elven maiden that
greeted you as you entered. The lights tend to

315
00:25:46,673 --> 00:25:49,592
blossom a little bit and you close the tent behind
you.

316
00:25:49,592 --> 00:25:54,685
LIAM: As we're leaving, I say, that's a good look.

317
00:25:54,685 --> 00:26:02,427
MATT: Gives a slight breathy chuckle that starts
beautiful. (chuckle turns into a cackle)

318
00:26:02,464 --> 00:26:06,021
ORION: What did we actually get?

319
00:26:06,021 --> 00:26:16,924
MATT: You acquired two potions of greater healing,
and a vial of caustic liquid. You are uncertain as

320
00:26:16,924 --> 00:26:18,451
to what its properties are.

321
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,078
MARISHA: Caustic liquid.

322
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:29,586
MATT: You also don't quite know the properties of
yours, but you gather, the assurance from a

323
00:26:29,586 --> 00:26:33,758
creature of this power, that she speaks in
riddles, but not in untruths.

324
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:39,136
ORION: I'm going to give you another one of the
greater potions. So mark that down.

325
00:26:39,136 --> 00:26:44,296
LIAM: Thank you. We're right in the middle of the
bazaar. Do we want to take a quick jog around? I

326
00:26:44,296 --> 00:26:47,583
grab someone passing by and say, you, potions?
Where? Here?

327
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:51,924
MATT: The person looks down at your arm, brushes
it off, and the middle-aged gentleman goes,

328
00:26:51,924 --> 00:26:58,757
"Sir, you do realize that most of the potion
trade is controlled by the clergy?"

329
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,250
MARISHA: They're all like no magic and stuff
here.

330
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:05,069
LIAM: I did not know that. Thank you. Well, shit.

331
00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:07,811
MARISHA: Wait. Did he say that it was controlled
by the clergy?

332
00:27:07,811 --> 00:27:09,546
ORION: So we should go there.

333
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:16,925
MARISHA: Hang on. Just because it is controlled by
the clergy doesn't mean that it's legal. Doesn't

334
00:27:16,925 --> 00:27:21,322
mean that if we go knocking on their door
requesting potions that they're going to take

335
00:27:21,354 --> 00:27:25,698
kindly to that. Kind of like getting your
concealed deadly

336
00:27:25,698 --> 00:27:29,062
weapons license in certain places.

337
00:27:29,062 --> 00:27:33,382
LIAM: I grab another weirdo passing by and say,
excuse me. There's probably a temple around here.

338
00:27:33,382 --> 00:27:36,566
Can you point us in the right direction?

339
00:27:36,566 --> 00:27:42,186
MATT: The individual looks at you awkwardly and
points over. And you can see just past the

340
00:27:42,186 --> 00:27:46,752
outskirts of this bazaar, there are a number of
buildings that line the outer area of this central

341
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:53,791
portion. You can see where he is pointing, there
is a large cathedral made of almost, from this

342
00:27:53,791 --> 00:28:00,689
distance, a warbling, warped obsidian, and it is
far more ominous and obelisk-like in appearance

343
00:28:00,689 --> 00:28:05,421
than the other temples. In a district of the city
that you haven't been to yet. But it is the

344
00:28:05,421 --> 00:28:07,092
closest temple.

345
00:28:07,092 --> 00:28:11,744
WIL: Warbling Obsidian is my Black Crowes cover
band.

346
00:28:11,744 --> 00:28:17,743
LIAM: I'm getting itchy. Can we just go to the
Take please?

347
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:25,075
MARISHA: I turn and I lean into Tiberius and I
say, he's going to be cranky the entire time

348
00:28:25,075 --> 00:28:26,742
we're on this field trip, isn't he?

349
00:28:26,742 --> 00:28:28,270
ORION: Yes, and usually I'm the cranky one.

350
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:29,543
MARISHA: I know.

351
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:32,195
ORION: So let's head to the temple. Right? Yes?

352
00:28:32,195 --> 00:28:33,885
MARISHA: I guess.

353
00:28:33,885 --> 00:28:35,803
ORION: Can you turn into a horse?

354
00:28:35,803 --> 00:28:40,823
MARISHA: Yes, but that's a little forward, don't
you think?

355
00:28:40,823 --> 00:28:42,241
ORION: I'm just asking.

356
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:44,817
LIAM: Are we going to the temple or the Take?

357
00:28:44,817 --> 00:28:47,601
ORION: Oh, the Take? What would make you feel
better?

358
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:51,271
LIAM: Let's get on with it, shall we? Jesus, 
whoever that is.

359
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:57,613
ORION: That was that one carpenter we met in in
Vasselheim.

360
00:28:57,667 --> 00:29:00,891
LIAM: Oh, he was sweet. He had some good herb.

361
00:29:00,891 --> 00:29:06,134
ORION: Yes, he did. He sure knew how to-- it was
dank.

362
00:29:06,134 --> 00:29:15,397
MATT: "Dank," which is arcane terms for
"thaumaturgical." Anyway. You make your way to the

363
00:29:15,397 --> 00:29:22,552
southern outskirts of this portion of the bazaar,
which leads its way into the central building

364
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:27,766
cluster portion of the Quad Roads district to the
outside of the Slayer's Take Guildhall. You walk

365
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:33,280
up to the main doorway which has the inscription
in front. And pushing the door open, you enter

366
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:42,571
into the main foyer area, where you see the same
cast-iron chandeliers hanging from the ceiling,

367
00:29:42,571 --> 00:29:49,057
the dark wood rafters frame the entire internal
area. And there sitting at the central desk is

368
00:29:49,057 --> 00:29:58,052
Mertin, the scarred-up halfling with the
relatively joyful disposition. He looks up from

369
00:29:58,052 --> 00:30:05,175
his books. "Okay, it appears to me that we have
the other half of this adventuring group to deal

370
00:30:05,175 --> 00:30:09,513
"with. Let us hope that perhaps you have better
luck than your previous friends in what has been

371
00:30:09,513 --> 00:30:11,143
"chosen for you, eh?"

372
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,693
LIAM: They already headed out?

373
00:30:12,693 --> 00:30:16,366
MATT: "Yes, they left not more than an hour ago, I
imagine."

374
00:30:16,366 --> 00:30:19,806
MARISHA: And what were they contracted with?

375
00:30:19,806 --> 00:30:22,547
MATT: "Oh, nothing. They're going to kill a
dragon. Would you like

376
00:30:22,547 --> 00:30:23,923
"me to go get the mistress for you?"

377
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:24,855
LIAM: Excuse me?

378
00:30:24,855 --> 00:30:27,591
MATT: "I'll take that as a yes. I'll be right
back."

379
00:30:27,591 --> 00:30:29,942
And he gets up from his table and wanders off.

380
00:30:29,942 --> 00:30:38,259
ORION: They'll be fine. I'm sure of it. Scanlan
makes good decisions all the time.

381
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:48,412
MATT: As you wait a few moments, eventually
Mertin returns. But he seems, his head down, a

382
00:30:48,412 --> 00:30:52,004
little humbly, and gestures out with his hands.
And you hear the familiar footsteps of the

383
00:30:52,004 --> 00:31:00,610
Huntmaster, Vanessa Cyndrial. Her tiefling
appearance both very striking in her chiseled bone

384
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:06,121
structure in her face, her dark leather armor
itself creaking slightly with each footstep. And

385
00:31:06,121 --> 00:31:09,772
she has that very commanding yet welcoming
appearance, which you know hides a very

386
00:31:09,772 --> 00:31:20,333
hard-to-read interior. She steps forward. "Well,
are you ready to take on the other half of this

387
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:27,811
"mission? Your friends were eager. And they
traveled with some of our finer warriors. Are you

388
00:31:27,811 --> 00:31:29,892
"confident in your capabilities today?"

389
00:31:29,892 --> 00:31:34,787
ORION: Listen, don't be smug with me. None of us
what to be here or cooperate with this stupid

390
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:37,557
event just to abide your laws.

391
00:31:37,557 --> 00:31:39,556
MARISHA: Tiberius, we could be on trial.

392
00:31:39,556 --> 00:31:42,149
ORION: The answer is yes. Let's get on with it.

393
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:49,235
MATT: "You see, it is very simple. I like it,
direct and to the point. I respect that."

394
00:31:49,235 --> 00:31:51,571
ORION: Oh. Well, thank you.

395
00:31:51,571 --> 00:31:57,743
MATT: "The angry, flowery part in the middle, not so
much a fan of. All right. So," she reaches behind

396
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:04,262
and pulls out what looks like a small, rolled-up
piece of parchment. Looks at it for a second.

397
00:32:04,262 --> 00:32:10,698
"Well, you have one other hopeful for this guild
that will be joining you for this, and a leader

398
00:32:10,698 --> 00:32:15,636
"will be assigned to you on this excursion to keep an eye
on you and make sure you stay within the rules and

399
00:32:15,676 --> 00:32:18,478
"not go absconding to some other country and we
have to hunt you down."

400
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,859
LIAM: Fantastic.

401
00:32:19,859 --> 00:32:21,440
ORION: Can we use the word liaison?

402
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,984
MATT: "A liaison, if you will. Mertin, would you
get the other hopeful for this?"

403
00:32:27,984 --> 00:32:33,172
Mertin says, "Of course, my lady." He gets up, and
walks over, and knocks on a door. As you hear the

404
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:39,392
door knock on the opposite side of the room, opens
it up. And the red, tousled hair, halfling.

405
00:32:39,392 --> 00:32:44,015
"Kashaw, your group has arrived."

406
00:32:44,015 --> 00:32:50,704
WILL: Well, it's about time. I'm sick of waiting.
(sighs) He walks out and meets everybody.

407
00:32:50,704 --> 00:32:56,421
MATT: As you guys look, the door opens, and a
human male steps out into the light. If you wish to

408
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:58,404
describe yourself.

409
00:32:58,404 --> 00:33:07,689
WILL: I am Kashaw Vesh, an acolyte. Here I am,
waiting for you for so long now. Do I have to

410
00:33:07,689 --> 00:33:09,750
travel with them the entire time?

411
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:13,596
MATT: "For the remainder of this contract at
least. But once you have joined the Guild, perhaps

412
00:33:13,596 --> 00:33:15,121
"other groups will be assigned to you."

413
00:33:15,121 --> 00:33:20,190
MARISHA: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, were we late? We
didn't mean to keep you waiting. Or do you mean

414
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:28,830
like, you've been waiting for us for a long time
in the destiny, "we're here and where have you

415
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,293
been my whole life" kind of way?

416
00:33:31,293 --> 00:33:33,351
WILL: Is she always like this?

417
00:33:33,351 --> 00:33:35,421
ORION: Yes, she is.

418
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:37,544
LIAM: Not good at reading emotions.

419
00:33:37,544 --> 00:33:40,182
WILL: This is going to be fun. Yes. No, I meant
you're late.

420
00:33:40,182 --> 00:33:42,925
MARISHA: Wait. Is that what people say about me?

421
00:33:42,925 --> 00:33:44,880
LIAM: I don't.

422
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,447
MARISHA: We'll talk later.

423
00:33:46,447 --> 00:33:47,528
WILL: Who are you?

424
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:49,345
LIAM: Vax'ildan.

425
00:33:49,345 --> 00:33:51,855
ORION: I am Tiberius Stormwind.

426
00:33:51,855 --> 00:33:53,449
WILL: A dragonborn.

427
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:56,885
LIAM: What's your thing? What do you do?

428
00:33:56,885 --> 00:34:01,681
WILL: What I do is not really important. What I
want to get done, I think, is what matters. What I

429
00:34:01,681 --> 00:34:04,814
want to do is start this quest. Is that what you
called it? Quest?

430
00:34:04,814 --> 00:34:05,960
MATT: "It is a contract."

431
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,449
WILL: A contract, a job. Can we just get out
there, please, and do what we have to do?

432
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:10,682
MATT: "Very well."

433
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:13,995
LIAM: I agree. Let's hurry it up, Merkin. Shall
we?

434
00:34:13,995 --> 00:34:16,454
WILL: That wasn't your name, was it?

435
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:20,563
MATT: "It's Mertin. Mertin is the name. But it's
okay."

436
00:34:20,563 --> 00:34:24,875
LIAM: I'm not from these parts. It's my accent.
Sorry.

437
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:36,089
MATT: "I can hear accent from upbringing. It's
Syngornian use. It's fine. Mertin. Never mind." By

438
00:34:36,089 --> 00:34:40,313
the way, the human that has walked out, you can
see has shoulder-length brown hair, a leather

439
00:34:40,313 --> 00:34:46,930
cord that is tied around the center of the
forehead. Eyes two different colors. One I believe

440
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,258
is a light blue?

441
00:34:48,258 --> 00:34:53,389
WILL: It's a light blue. One is a bright yellow.
And his right arm, all the way up from where you

442
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:56,576
can see where it disappears below the armor is
covered in one-inch cuts,

443
00:34:56,576 --> 00:35:00,516
with scars all the way up.

444
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:02,375
ORION: Ah, a religious man.

445
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:03,811
WILL: Maybe.

446
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:11,119
MATT: Mertin goes over and knocks on a door, opens
it up. This individual is easy to hear from a

447
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:16,256
distance. The heavy footfalls and the grumbling
echoes through the hallways before he even

448
00:35:16,256 --> 00:35:21,516
appears. Mertin leads you into the light of the
main foyer area. "This will be the group of which

449
00:35:21,516 --> 00:35:25,481
"you will be guiding on this. I appreciate you
doing this for us. I know it's not really usually

450
00:35:25,481 --> 00:35:30,299
"what you do. But here is your team for this
contract."

451
00:35:30,299 --> 00:35:36,626
WIL: I'm sorry, where is the team?

452
00:35:36,626 --> 00:35:38,058
MATT: "This is your team."

453
00:35:38,058 --> 00:35:42,981
And Vanessa chuckles to herself. "I'm sorry. This
is what you'll be dealing with today."

454
00:35:42,981 --> 00:35:45,312
MARISHA: Hi.

455
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:48,749
ORION: Hello, I'm Tiberius Stormwind.

456
00:35:48,749 --> 00:35:51,518
MATT: "Now Thorbir, play nice."

457
00:35:51,518 --> 00:35:54,821
MARISHA: What was that?

458
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:58,382
MATT: "Thorbir. Thorbir, play nice."

459
00:35:58,382 --> 00:36:10,804
WIL: So he's a dwarf. He's a really stout dwarf.
He's got really a long, red beard that's singed off

460
00:36:10,804 --> 00:36:22,901
in the lower right corner. The bottom of the top
part of his beard is braided and clamped off with

461
00:36:22,901 --> 00:36:29,571
all these ornate things. He's got these big,
thick, ropey, white braids that come down on

462
00:36:29,571 --> 00:36:37,602
either side of his face and frame his face. And
these have these really big Dwarven runes on them.

463
00:36:37,602 --> 00:36:39,505
Do any of you speak Dwarven?

464
00:36:39,505 --> 00:36:40,454
ORION: Yes.

465
00:36:40,454 --> 00:36:41,441
MARISHA: No.

466
00:36:41,441 --> 00:36:42,355
WILL: Yes.

467
00:36:42,355 --> 00:36:50,296
WIL: All right, so for those of you who speak
Dwarven, this is a really offensive curse word in

468
00:36:50,296 --> 00:36:56,990
Dwarven. And this one is an even more offensive
curse word in Dwarven. You don't say these in

469
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:03,513
friendly company. He's got a scar that
runs down across his face. And the eye that it

470
00:37:03,568 --> 00:37:12,604
runs through is black. And his other eye is blue.
And you can see that he's got Dwarven script

471
00:37:12,604 --> 00:37:19,205
written in tattoos all the way down his right
arm.

472
00:37:19,248 --> 00:37:24,818
MATT: "So please, if you would not mind making
sure that they see their contract to fruition,

473
00:37:24,818 --> 00:37:30,306
"taking them on this as you will, showing them the
ropes of the guild, and try not get them killed."

474
00:37:30,306 --> 00:37:32,498
WIL: And for me?

475
00:37:32,498 --> 00:37:37,603
MATT: "Well, you will be rewarded as per the
contract. You will have done the guild a great

476
00:37:37,603 --> 00:37:40,477
"favor, which you know favors can go a very long
way in the guild."

477
00:37:40,477 --> 00:37:45,794
WIL: I certainly do. You don't have to tell me
about repaying favors.

478
00:37:45,794 --> 00:37:53,514
MATT: "Fair enough. Well, perhaps now would be a
good time for this jovial lot of adventurers to

479
00:37:53,514 --> 00:37:56,369
"know what it is they are to hunt down."

480
00:37:56,369 --> 00:37:58,948
WIL: Is it an actual group?

481
00:37:58,948 --> 00:38:04,760
MATT: "Well, we'll see how well you can make it
into one. Perhaps this is a test for you as well,

482
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,183
"fair dwarf."

483
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:09,253
MARISHA: I think is going to be an excellent
bonding experience.

484
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:10,815
WILL: Seriously, the whole time she is like this?

485
00:38:10,815 --> 00:38:13,316
ORION: Yes, she is. It grows on you, though.

486
00:38:13,316 --> 00:38:15,186
WILL: I'm sure it does.

487
00:38:15,186 --> 00:38:16,352
So does the plague.

488
00:38:16,352 --> 00:38:18,960
MARISHA: Everyone has such a problem with
optimism.

489
00:38:19,013 --> 00:38:27,409
MATT: She unravels it. Looks at it. "I think this
will do well for what is required. We will bind

490
00:38:27,409 --> 00:38:32,889
"this contract to you now. Feel free to take over.
If you wouldn't mind reading, half-elf."

491
00:38:32,889 --> 00:38:45,358
MARISHA: You know, public speaking is not really
my strong suit. Okay. Ordered and paid in advance

492
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:47,635
by anonymous.

493
00:38:47,635 --> 00:38:50,838
ORION: Oh, they're a fun group.

494
00:38:50,838 --> 00:38:55,689
MARISHA: This contract, binding in honor and the
elements, sets upon the agreed members of the

495
00:38:55,734 --> 00:39:00,816
Slayer's Take Guildhall, and the task of locating
and slaying the below-mentioned entity, and the

496
00:39:00,816 --> 00:39:10,123
recovery of the below-listed harvested anatomy
items. And any anatomy items not recovered or not

497
00:39:10,123 --> 00:39:15,980
in functional condition will be deducted from the
final payment and refunded to the client. Oh. This

498
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:21,333
contract is good for three days and should the
contract not be fulfilled within that time period,

499
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:26,272
all payments are null and void, this contract is
null and void, and membership of the Slayer's Take

500
00:39:26,272 --> 00:39:30,765
is revoked-- outside of the Huntmaster's willful
forgiveness.

501
00:39:30,765 --> 00:39:32,910
LIAM: Skip to the punchline.

502
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:41,901
MARISHA: The quarry has been approved for hunting
by the Holy Paramours of the Crown of Erathis. The

503
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:50,374
quarry of one rakshasa. What's a rakshasa?

504
00:39:50,374 --> 00:39:51,770
LIAM: Tiger man.

505
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:53,326
MARISHA: Tiger man?

506
00:39:53,326 --> 00:39:55,179
LIAM: Essentially.

507
00:39:55,179 --> 00:39:56,650
WILL: How do you know that?

508
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:59,915
LIAM: Storybooks in Syngorn.

509
00:39:59,915 --> 00:40:10,159
MARISHA: We need two rakshasa eyes, one rakshasa
tongue, one rakshasa heart, two rakshasa claws,

510
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:14,544
and two rakshasa canine teeth. So canine.

511
00:40:14,544 --> 00:40:17,062
ORION: Would this be an arcana or this be a
history check?

512
00:40:17,062 --> 00:40:19,182
MATT: This would be more of an arcana check.

513
00:40:19,182 --> 00:40:21,150
ORION: I'm going to do an arcana check. 18.

514
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:29,975
MATT: 18? Rakshasas were entities that originally
stemmed from the realm of the Nine Hells. They are

515
00:40:29,975 --> 00:40:41,318
devils. They are deceptive, and usually embed
themselves in elements of society where they can

516
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:50,294
grasp and take power. They love having servitude
beneath them, and they are notoriously difficult

517
00:40:50,294 --> 00:40:59,314
and slippery to find, let alone nail down and
destroy. Appearance-wise, they look like a normal

518
00:40:59,314 --> 00:41:07,655
humanoid man, but have the face of a tiger, and
the other curious element is both of their hands

519
00:41:07,655 --> 00:41:15,076
are reversed. That's as much as you can glean from
your formal training and understanding.

520
00:41:15,076 --> 00:41:18,083
LIAM: Does this cat have a name?

521
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:22,353
MATT: "Why does it matter? All we know is we can
confirm that there is one within the vicinity,

522
00:41:22,353 --> 00:41:27,005
"or huntable at the very least. The rest is
up to you to find."

523
00:41:27,005 --> 00:41:33,436
MARISHA: The quarry is where it's been last
located? Oh, okay. Yeah, you double-check it. I

524
00:41:33,436 --> 00:41:35,272
might have missed something.

525
00:41:35,272 --> 00:41:37,182
WILL: Why can't we know who the client is?

526
00:41:37,182 --> 00:41:40,967
MATT: "The client has decided they wish to remain
anonymous for this contract."

527
00:41:40,967 --> 00:41:44,434
ORION: This seems to be bothering you, Kashaw.

528
00:41:44,434 --> 00:41:48,098
WILL: Everything's been bothering me lately. She's
not helping. Do you want to read this?

529
00:41:48,098 --> 00:41:55,498
ORION: It's going to say the same thing. Which
part?

530
00:41:55,498 --> 00:42:00,912
WILL: Give me this. How far to the quarry?

531
00:42:00,912 --> 00:42:05,198
MATT: "Your quarry is the creature."

532
00:42:05,198 --> 00:42:09,123
WILL: You said it was in the vicinity. What are we
talking "in the vicinity?" Are we talking a day's

533
00:42:09,123 --> 00:42:10,936
hike? We talking an hour from here?

534
00:42:10,936 --> 00:42:14,379
MATT: "Meaning, we've been able to confirm that
there is one that is within a huntable distance

535
00:42:14,379 --> 00:42:19,865
"within the three days of the contract. However,
part of this trial is to see just how good you are

536
00:42:19,865 --> 00:42:25,876
"at finding and destroying such creatures, so that
information is for you to find, unless you do not

537
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:29,347
"feel your skills are up to par for the Slayer's
Take, in which case, you are more than welcome to

538
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:32,226
"go for the door, human."

539
00:42:32,226 --> 00:42:37,645
LIAM: And you have no further information? Are
there any grumpkins you want us to find? Do you

540
00:42:37,645 --> 00:42:42,670
expect us to go out with no information at all to
find a man with a tiger's head?

541
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:48,416
MATT: "Well, you seem like a well-traveled unit.
You seem to have done well enough to find and

542
00:42:48,416 --> 00:42:53,417
"destroy great things you spoke of as you walked
into these halls. Prove to me that you are more

543
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:58,234
"than just sell-swords. Show to me that you have
the intellect, that you have the skill sets, that

544
00:42:58,234 --> 00:43:03,669
"you have the cleverness to find the creature that
does not wish to be found."

545
00:43:03,669 --> 00:43:06,374
LIAM: Is this how things normally go around here?

546
00:43:06,374 --> 00:43:11,848
WIL: Normally, I don't waste my time with the
likes of you. Man with a tiger's head is going to

547
00:43:11,848 --> 00:43:18,541
stand out. No problem finding him. Let's stand
here and talk about this forever, or let's head

548
00:43:18,585 --> 00:43:20,975
out and get this over with.

549
00:43:20,975 --> 00:43:27,800
ORION: Well, dwarf, why don't you do your title and
lead then? And I should warn you, you are walking

550
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:35,823
with a Stormwind. You may not know my name, but I
can assure you, I alone am an army, so we are well

551
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:39,328
protected. So, lead us to find this tiger-man,
please.

552
00:43:39,328 --> 00:43:41,577
WIL: Dragonborn is a lot of talk.

553
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:45,866
WILL: If he's an army, why not just send him out?

554
00:43:45,866 --> 00:43:50,084
MARISHA: That was probably the ballsiest thing
you've ever said.

555
00:43:50,084 --> 00:43:54,822
WIL: All right, Storm?

556
00:43:54,822 --> 00:43:59,476
ORION: Wind. People call me Tibsy.

557
00:43:59,476 --> 00:44:04,402
WIL: Let's see how good you are at following. And
he heads out.

558
00:44:04,402 --> 00:44:07,268
LIAM: He's not very good. Oh, he's gone.

559
00:44:07,268 --> 00:44:11,749
MATT: As the dwarf exits, and you guys follow.
Outside of the Slayer's Take into the center of

560
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:20,314
the main Quad Roads thoroughfare, on the outskirts
of the bazaar to seek a rakshasa, wherever one may

561
00:44:20,314 --> 00:44:22,624
be found.

562
00:44:22,624 --> 00:44:25,866
MARISHA: I thought this was going to be a fun
field trip.

563
00:44:25,866 --> 00:44:28,876
ORION: Well, I mean "rakshasa" does sound fun.
Rakshasa!

564
00:44:28,876 --> 00:44:33,888
MARISHA: It does. It is a tiger person, so maybe
we can relate.

565
00:44:33,888 --> 00:44:36,070
WILL: I want to switch teams.

566
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:40,007
ORION: No, it gets better.

567
00:44:40,007 --> 00:44:45,768
LIAM: What's your name again? I'm sorry.

568
00:44:45,768 --> 00:44:49,042
WILL: I am Kashaw Vesh. Call me Brother Kash.
Everyone else does.

569
00:44:49,042 --> 00:44:52,336
LIAM: Kash. Brother Kash, are you new to the
Guild, as well?

570
00:44:52,336 --> 00:44:56,926
WILL: I'm not a member of the Guild yet. I had
something happen with someone who did something

571
00:44:56,966 --> 00:44:59,803
and now I'm here. Why don't we leave it at that,
for now?

572
00:44:59,803 --> 00:45:01,309
LIAM: That's how we got here.

573
00:45:01,309 --> 00:45:04,277
WILL: Apparently, I only have to be here for
another three days, which will be good.

574
00:45:04,277 --> 00:45:05,992
LIAM: All right.

575
00:45:05,992 --> 00:45:14,717
WIL: I'm impatient. Perception 20. Is there
anything around that indicates where, which of

576
00:45:14,717 --> 00:45:20,153
these four directions is the best direction to
go?

577
00:45:20,153 --> 00:45:28,049
MATT: Knowing the city for the while that you've
been here, you know there are places of open

578
00:45:28,049 --> 00:45:32,094
business that have a lot of traffic are also
good places to ask for if anyone has seen anything

579
00:45:32,094 --> 00:45:37,123
that might match a certain description, or an
individual that you are seeking, any strange

580
00:45:37,123 --> 00:45:42,974
behavior. And so you know that the center of the
Quad Roads where that bazaar is, is a good place

581
00:45:42,974 --> 00:45:46,644
to start requesting information as you have
currently none at your disposal.

582
00:45:46,644 --> 00:45:51,062
MARISHA: Just to get this clear, a rakshasa's not
a beast?

583
00:45:51,062 --> 00:45:53,425
MATT: It's like a man.

584
00:45:53,425 --> 00:45:55,087
WILL and ORION: It's a demon.

585
00:45:55,087 --> 00:45:57,658
MATT: It's a demon creature that looks like a
man.

586
00:45:57,658 --> 00:46:00,864
MARISHA: But it's not a beast, by definition?

587
00:46:00,864 --> 00:46:02,074
MATT: No.

588
00:46:02,074 --> 00:46:07,962
LIAM: I'm sorry. I'd like to make an insight check
on the dwarf, not to see if he is lying, but he

589
00:46:07,962 --> 00:46:11,874
could be. Can I get a gut instinct into what his
deal is?

590
00:46:11,874 --> 00:46:14,149
MATT: Go ahead and make an insight check.

591
00:46:14,149 --> 00:46:21,932
LIAM: Three, but I'm going to use my Luck to try
that again. 18 plus two is 20.

592
00:46:21,932 --> 00:46:25,819
MATT: Would you like to go ahead and roll a 20?

593
00:46:25,819 --> 00:46:31,351
WIL: Yeah, that's a two. All right.

594
00:46:31,351 --> 00:46:34,362
(laughter)

595
00:46:34,362 --> 00:46:39,176
LIAM: Just reinforce the myth, man.

596
00:46:39,176 --> 00:46:50,490
WIL: That's one better than I usually roll. I'd
say it's twice as good as I usually do.

597
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:59,792
MATT: Gruff exterior. There is definitely a
toughened past to him. He seems driven. Not

598
00:46:59,792 --> 00:47:07,157
necessarily untrustworthy, per se, but definitely
a man of little patience and currently does not

599
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:10,689
seem to be too pleased with the fact that he's
essentially babysitting, in his mind.

600
00:47:10,689 --> 00:47:12,456
LIAM: Is there a marshmallow center?

601
00:47:12,456 --> 00:47:17,861
MATT: You may find out in due time. Yet that is
too hard to read at this moment.

602
00:47:17,861 --> 00:47:24,803
WILL: If you're in the bazaar, do I have to be out
of the city to cast Locate Creature?

603
00:47:24,803 --> 00:47:28,982
MATT: You can cast that anywhere you want to. Your
magic is divine. This is your city.

604
00:47:28,982 --> 00:47:31,432
LIAM: And that's not just a descriptor, either.

605
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:40,739
WILL: Thank you. It's normally fabulous, but not
in this city. So then how do I go about casting

606
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:42,071
Locate Creature?

607
00:47:42,071 --> 00:47:43,381
MATT: You can just tell me.

608
00:47:43,381 --> 00:47:45,466
WILL: I'd like to go ahead and cast Locate
Creature.

609
00:47:45,466 --> 00:47:48,774
MATT: All right, so as you guys are having this
discussion, you're having this weird stare-off and

610
00:47:48,774 --> 00:47:53,559
considering where to go in the bazaar. You stop in
the nearby alley two buildings down from where the

611
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:57,874
Slayer's Take Guildhall is. And you begin just
taking a small dagger from your side and carving a

612
00:47:57,874 --> 00:48:07,071
circle in the ground. Throw some runes down that
are specific to your patron. Take a moment and

613
00:48:07,071 --> 00:48:16,373
concentrate on the description of this rakshasa.
Looking at the specifics of the spell to make sure

614
00:48:16,373 --> 00:48:26,264
that I don't give you misinformation... Locate
Creature. Beautiful.

615
00:48:26,264 --> 00:48:29,209
WILL: You guys have jazz hands.

616
00:48:29,209 --> 00:48:31,505
ORION and WILL: Rakshasa.

617
00:48:31,505 --> 00:48:37,537
MATT: You focus your mind for a second, and your
holy symbol begins to drift up from underneath

618
00:48:37,537 --> 00:48:42,488
your armor. You instinctively take and slap it
down underneath, and then refocus your vision,

619
00:48:42,488 --> 00:48:47,647
your eyes closed. And you can see what looks like
a pulsing energy, like a very dark flame.

620
00:48:47,647 --> 00:48:52,988
Something that itself, you can already smell the
sulfur. You can smell the lineage, the devil

621
00:48:52,988 --> 00:49:01,387
lineage that this entity is. And there is indeed
one not too terribly far from where you currently are.

622
00:49:01,387 --> 00:49:04,978
It's faint, which means that it is on the
outskirts. And you know this lasts for a good

623
00:49:04,978 --> 00:49:11,465
thousand feet or so. But it does give you a
northeastern direction. And the spell fades.

624
00:49:11,465 --> 00:49:13,742
MARISHA: Northeastern direction.

625
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:20,315
WILL: We should go northeast. It is also
unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how

626
00:49:20,315 --> 00:49:22,600
you look at it, closer than we thought.

627
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,555
LIAM: In the walls of the city?

628
00:49:24,555 --> 00:49:27,606
WILL: Not in the walls, but very close to them.

629
00:49:27,606 --> 00:49:33,045
MARISHA: Do we have any type of plan of attack?
Does anyone know how to fight these things? Any

630
00:49:33,045 --> 00:49:34,350
earthly clue?

631
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:35,398
WILL: Leader boy?

632
00:49:35,398 --> 00:49:37,085
MARISHA: Leader boy?

633
00:49:37,085 --> 00:49:39,162
WIL: I'm sorry, are you talking to me?

634
00:49:39,162 --> 00:49:41,339
ORION: Thorbir is what they meant to say.

635
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:43,281
WILL: Listen to Stormfather over here.

636
00:49:43,281 --> 00:49:47,482
MARISHA: I take my social cues from other people. I'm
sorry.

637
00:49:47,482 --> 00:49:49,910
WIL: In my experience, there has not been a
problem invented

638
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:51,863
that can't be solved with an axe.

639
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:54,435
ORION: That's true. We've seen that.

640
00:49:54,435 --> 00:49:56,300
WILL: Wonderfully helpful. Thank you.

641
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,557
WIL: You're welcome.

642
00:49:57,557 --> 00:49:59,008
LIAM: Follow the axe.

643
00:49:59,008 --> 00:50:06,167
WIL: Now what I want you to do is imagine an 
hourglass. You got that? Good picture of an hourglass

644
00:50:06,208 --> 00:50:11,693
in your heads? See all that sand draining out?
Let's get a move on.

645
00:50:11,693 --> 00:50:14,746
ORION: Okay. What am I doing with this sand?

646
00:50:14,746 --> 00:50:20,267
MARISHA: I agree with that. Are we supposed to do
something with the sand?

647
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,092
WIL: Yeah, count it.

648
00:50:22,092 --> 00:50:26,022
MARISHA: Oh, that would take so long. Can we
tag-team this?

649
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:27,787
WIL: She always like this?

650
00:50:27,787 --> 00:50:29,040
ORION: Yes.

651
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:38,014
WILL: Stormcloud's counting sand. I don't know
what she's doing over here. Northeast. How about

652
00:50:38,014 --> 00:50:42,352
let's start walking that way and see what happens? Can
we give that a shot?

653
00:50:42,352 --> 00:50:44,990
ORION: I agree. You did the fancy spell.

654
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:47,829
WILL: It's not as fancy as you might think.

655
00:50:47,829 --> 00:50:56,321
WIL: I've pulled my axe out and I'm sort of
holding it like a walking stick. And just very

656
00:50:56,321 --> 00:51:01,387
deliberately, very demonstratively walking ahead
in that direction.

657
00:51:01,387 --> 00:51:04,485
MATT: With each footfall, you know that what was
once, probably hundreds of years ago, a nice

658
00:51:04,485 --> 00:51:12,749
cobblestone roadway in the center of the city has
been slowly hit with mud, dirt, snow, sleet, and

659
00:51:12,749 --> 00:51:16,913
so each step is a slight moisture with each
footfall.

660
00:51:16,913 --> 00:51:19,510
ORION: I'm assuming there's no stables around.

661
00:51:19,598 --> 00:51:22,649
MATT: Not immediately, those are usually to the
very outside of the city.

662
00:51:22,649 --> 00:51:25,082
LIAM: Why are you jonesing for a horse?

663
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:29,931
ORION: So I don't get all dirty.

664
00:51:29,931 --> 00:51:40,468
MATT: Thorbir, leading forward in the northeastern
direction that was given by Brother Kash,

665
00:51:40,468 --> 00:51:48,471
eventually brings you around the side of the
bazaar. And you can now see why it's called the

666
00:51:48,471 --> 00:51:52,404
Quad Roads, there are two main roads that meet
right where the bazaar occurs and then they spread

667
00:51:52,404 --> 00:51:56,880
off into the other sections of the city. To the
northeastern section, from your guys' perspective,

668
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:05,253
the district begins to drift into another district
that you have not previously visited. This

669
00:52:05,253 --> 00:52:11,936
district is, you've heard it mentioned before,
known as the Duskmeadow. Now, previous sections

670
00:52:11,936 --> 00:52:17,493
you've been in have been worshipers of Bahamut,
the Platinum Dragon. There was the Braving

671
00:52:17,493 --> 00:52:23,116
Grounds, which worships Kord, the god of strength
and warfare and honor. The Quad Roads, which is

672
00:52:23,116 --> 00:52:29,733
under Erathis, the deity of civilization and
invention. The Duskmeadow falls under the watchful

673
00:52:29,733 --> 00:52:40,071
eye of the Raven Queen, the goddess of death. That
large obsidian-type structure that you were led

674
00:52:40,071 --> 00:52:45,213
to earlier is the temple that resides in the
center of this district. And you've heard mention

675
00:52:45,213 --> 00:52:49,168
before of a few of the things that exist here.
That being probably Raven's Crest, which is

676
00:52:49,298 --> 00:52:55,207
the main temple to the Raven Queen. This is also
where the Amaranthine Oubliette is located, which

677
00:52:55,207 --> 00:52:58,508
is essentially the prison of the entire city of
Vasselheim.

678
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:00,132
MARISHA: The what?

679
00:53:00,132 --> 00:53:02,114
MATT: The Amaranthine Oubliette.

680
00:53:02,114 --> 00:53:08,640
ORION: Hammertime oubliette.

681
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,697
MARISHA: Oh, there it is.

682
00:53:10,697 --> 00:53:17,927
MATT: This is also where most of the dead of the
city are interred into a series of catacombs that

683
00:53:17,927 --> 00:53:24,791
are built deep beneath this section of the city.
Far enough away from the oubliette to the point

684
00:53:24,791 --> 00:53:28,859
where isn't crossover and is enough of an escape,
because that apparently has happened in the past

685
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:33,779
history of the city. As you begin pushing towards the
edge of where the two districts meet, you can see

686
00:53:33,825 --> 00:53:41,273
that there is an area of the town that, for lack of
better term, it's a more jovial than expected

687
00:53:41,273 --> 00:53:46,386
area. There are a series of stands put up along
the side of the road. There's a lot of beggars

688
00:53:46,386 --> 00:53:50,868
sitting on the side of the street that are
currently panhandling to those who walk by. There

689
00:53:50,868 --> 00:53:57,220
are a number of taverns. You can hear music coming
from various establishments. And it seems almost

690
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:02,638
the closer you get to the death-oriented district
on the border of the Quad Roads, the more and more

691
00:54:02,638 --> 00:54:13,041
it pushes into a shadier Mardi Gras-type
experience. So you make your way towards that

692
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:17,648
dividing line there. What you would like to do?

693
00:54:17,648 --> 00:54:19,511
ORION: What say you, Thorbir?

694
00:54:19,511 --> 00:54:24,485
WIL: Let's ask around and see if anything has been
a little out the ordinary, or maybe,

695
00:54:24,485 --> 00:54:26,895
in the ordinary.

696
00:54:26,895 --> 00:54:31,175
ORION: Yes, I like that phrasing.

697
00:54:31,175 --> 00:54:37,296
WILL: Have to imagine anywhere this thing goes,
there's going to be strange deaths associated with

698
00:54:37,296 --> 00:54:39,131
it. We might as well look there.

699
00:54:39,131 --> 00:54:42,377
ORION: That's actually a good idea, as well.

700
00:54:42,377 --> 00:54:48,073
LIAM: And where we're walking, are there shops and
stands, as well, or is it residential?

701
00:54:48,073 --> 00:54:55,245
MATT: There are many that sell jewelry, many that
sell very well-made clothing, some of them party

702
00:54:55,245 --> 00:55:02,675
attire, there are some that sell exotic fruits
that have been imported in various states of ripeness.

703
00:55:02,675 --> 00:55:04,987
MARISHA: Is anyone selling any masks?

704
00:55:04,987 --> 00:55:07,347
MATT: Make a perception check.

705
00:55:07,347 --> 00:55:13,432
MARISHA: Passive or active?

706
00:55:13,432 --> 00:55:15,832
MATT: That would be an active perception check as
you're seeking it.

707
00:55:15,832 --> 00:55:17,068
MARISHA: 21.

708
00:55:17,068 --> 00:55:22,690
MATT: 21. You do glance around and there is one
cart that carries costume, party attire supplies.

709
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:25,380
It doesn't seem to have too many customers right
now, but they do have

710
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:28,271
a couple of masks that are on display.

711
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:31,663
MARISHA: Are there any masks that look like tiger
masks?

712
00:55:31,663 --> 00:55:36,498
MATT: Looking at it, there are none that are
tiger-specific, no. They seem to be molded leather

713
00:55:36,498 --> 00:55:40,541
and some more impish, goblin-y in appearance.

714
00:55:40,541 --> 00:55:44,122
MARISHA: Is there someone working the stand?

715
00:55:44,122 --> 00:55:51,313
MATT: There is, yes. You see a woman in her
forties or so, thin, with a big toothy smile. Her

716
00:55:51,313 --> 00:55:55,046
hair is pulled back into tight bun. You can see
there's little bit of her blondish hair turning to

717
00:55:55,046 --> 00:55:57,184
gray on the sides around her ears, Reed Richard-style.

718
00:55:57,184 --> 00:56:02,358
ORION: Did you say this was the Bahamut part of
town, too?

719
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:08,906
MATT: The Bahamut section is far away. That's
another section of the city. You are now on the

720
00:56:08,906 --> 00:56:14,422
line between the Duskmeadow and the Quad Roads, so
it's Erathis and the Raven Queen.

721
00:56:14,422 --> 00:56:18,689
LIAM: I'm pulling a mask off the wall. This is a
beautiful piece. Do you make them yourself?

722
00:56:18,689 --> 00:56:23,353
MATT: "I do. I do, I make them myself by hand,
hence the price."

723
00:56:23,353 --> 00:56:31,157
LIAM: They are quite beautiful. We're travelers
here. I've never seen a neighborhood like this. Is

724
00:56:31,157 --> 00:56:35,154
there a festival going on here, or is this pretty
much the basic fare of the day here?

725
00:56:35,154 --> 00:56:38,858
MATT: "This is the localized festival of the city.
If you've been around Vasselheim long enough

726
00:56:38,858 --> 00:56:44,183
"you've seen there is little interest in
celebration depending on some places. But, at

727
00:56:44,183 --> 00:56:51,032
"least on this line, some people can appreciate the
fleetness that is life and grasp it by the roots

728
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:52,740
"and make it its own before it's snuffed out."

729
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:59,031
LIAM: Here particularly, there seems to be
electricity in the air almost. It's very bustling.

730
00:56:59,031 --> 00:57:01,771
This is the norm around here?

731
00:57:01,771 --> 00:57:07,188
MATT: "Consistently. That's why I come and bring
my business here. I wouldn't do very well up

732
00:57:07,188 --> 00:57:12,476
"north, I'll tell you that. All them dragon
types--" Looks to you. "No offense. All them

733
00:57:12,535 --> 00:57:18,176
"silver dragon lovers have an issue with things as
celebratory."

734
00:57:18,176 --> 00:57:25,647
LIAM: And I pull out ten gold, and I spread them
on her desk.

735
00:57:25,647 --> 00:57:27,087
MATT: "How many masks?"

736
00:57:27,087 --> 00:57:28,354
LIAM: Oh, none.

737
00:57:28,354 --> 00:57:29,959
MARISHA: Oh, I would like one.

738
00:57:29,959 --> 00:57:31,425
MATT: "Take your pick."

739
00:57:31,425 --> 00:57:36,584
LIAM: I slide one coin away from the other nine,
and then dragging my finger across those say, is

740
00:57:36,584 --> 00:57:41,374
there anything out of the ordinary these days?

741
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:45,582
MATT: Go ahead and make a persuasion roll.

742
00:57:45,582 --> 00:57:48,421
LIAM: 15.

743
00:57:48,421 --> 00:58:01,641
MATT: 15? She gives you a look like she's trying
to read you, looks about left and right. Glances

744
00:58:01,641 --> 00:58:07,532
at you and looks a little ugh. Glances at you and
looks really taken aback, and then comes back to you

745
00:58:07,532 --> 00:58:09,745
with a escape of comfort.

746
00:58:09,745 --> 00:58:15,612
LIAM: Watching her, I pull out another five and
spread them in front of the first nine.

747
00:58:15,612 --> 00:58:24,491
MATT: "Well, I mean, some businesses here are a
bit shady, I won't lie. And there are some

748
00:58:24,491 --> 00:58:34,222
"long-standing businesses that have quarrels.
Usually, they end in small scuffles, or one

749
00:58:34,222 --> 00:58:42,834
"purchases the other and ousts them from the city.
This is one of the few areas in which the more adult pleasures can be

750
00:58:42,834 --> 00:58:48,501
"found, so there's a lot of money to be had. But
recently, there's been, at least from what I've

751
00:58:48,501 --> 00:58:55,462
"heard, a series of bodies have turned up. There
were a few found, fished out by the Bastions in

752
00:58:55,462 --> 00:59:00,050
"the water trough on the outskirts of the
Duskmeadow."

753
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:02,391
LIAM: The Bastions: what are they?

754
00:59:02,391 --> 00:59:10,376
MATT: "Bastions who are the guardians of the city.
From what I hear, they had been mauled by some

755
00:59:10,376 --> 00:59:12,101
"sort of strange beast."

756
00:59:12,101 --> 00:59:13,890
LIAM: Mauled?

757
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:17,267
MATT: "Now, beasts on the outside of the city,
that I can see. But on the inside, that is the

758
00:59:17,267 --> 00:59:19,311
"stuff of nightmares. Is it not?"

759
00:59:19,311 --> 00:59:21,818
ORION: Yes, I would agree.

760
00:59:21,818 --> 00:59:25,750
MARISHA: Have you had invaders like this before?

761
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:34,277
MATT: "I mean, death is not an uncommon occurrence
for certain areas of the city." And she gestures

762
00:59:34,277 --> 00:59:41,386
off to the distant temple. "Some people invite it,
even. But such violent death like this is usually

763
00:59:41,386 --> 00:59:46,917
"kept to the outside of the city, at least with
some sort of cause. This seems to be a murderous

764
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:51,296
"rampage that, me personally, I don't want to go
out at night without protection."

765
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:55,727
MARISHA: Is there is any indication of the cause
of death on these corpses? How do they find them?

766
00:59:55,727 --> 00:59:59,975
MATT: "I don't know. I've not investigated.
Perhaps you have to ask the Bastions yourself

767
00:59:59,975 --> 01:00:01,840
"that. Or anyone who was in the vicinity."

768
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,017
LIAM: And can you point us in the right
direction?

769
01:00:04,149 --> 01:00:10,933
MATT: She looks around, and points off. And you
can see, there isn't a whole lot of Bastion

770
01:00:10,933 --> 01:00:16,580
presence in this portion of the city, especially
since the Bastions are more of a voluntary guard.

771
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:23,282
People from the different clergies, the different
temples, train to become Bastions, and fit

772
01:00:23,282 --> 01:00:28,863
themselves with whatever their deity's armor is. You
do see there are two Bastions armored in a very

773
01:00:28,863 --> 01:00:37,032
dark, dark brown leather that carry a symbol of
what looks like a silver raven that is embroidered

774
01:00:37,032 --> 01:00:39,882
on one shoulder of a cloak that is tossed to one
side.

775
01:00:39,882 --> 01:00:41,615
LIAM: These guys are right here, essentially?

776
01:00:41,615 --> 01:00:46,926
MATT: Yeah. Oh. They're across the road about
maybe a block up. "I believe they're Bastions from

777
01:00:46,926 --> 01:00:49,082
"the Duskmeadow. Perhaps you could ask them."

778
01:00:49,082 --> 01:00:52,316
MARISHA: Does she have any masks that look like a
raven? A raven mask?

779
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:54,592
MATT: She does actually have one that looks like a
raven.

780
01:00:54,592 --> 01:00:55,887
MARISHA: I want that one.

781
01:00:55,887 --> 01:01:00,301
MATT: "Very well. A good choice. It doesn't quite
match the color of your attire, but perhaps I have

782
01:01:00,301 --> 01:01:01,931
"an outfit that could match for you?"

783
01:01:01,931 --> 01:01:02,958
MARISHA: Oh!

784
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:05,032
WILL: Oh my god, we're going clothes shopping.

785
01:01:05,032 --> 01:01:10,276
MARISHA: Do you have a little cloak as well? A
little cape?

786
01:01:10,276 --> 01:01:13,942
MATT: "Cloaks I don't, but there but there is a
cloakery about four blocks that way on your left.

787
01:01:13,942 --> 01:01:15,748
"They can probably help you there."

788
01:01:15,748 --> 01:01:16,899
MARISHA: Thank you so much.

789
01:01:16,899 --> 01:01:18,142
MATT: "Of course."

790
01:01:18,142 --> 01:01:22,162
LIAM: I notice a serpent-shaped mask on the wall.
I just pick it up and put it on and say, thank

791
01:01:22,162 --> 01:01:27,218
you, madam. Much obliged. And walk off and clap
Thorbir on the shoulder and keep walking.

792
01:01:27,218 --> 01:01:34,775
WIL: Thorbir hangs back a little bit and waits for
them to get to the door. And he looks at the shop

793
01:01:34,775 --> 01:01:42,356
keep and, do you have any masks that might fit a
little girl?

794
01:01:42,356 --> 01:01:51,449
MATT: "Yes, of course, friend dwarf." And she goes
and rummages through a small bag and pulls out a

795
01:01:51,449 --> 01:02:00,125
mask. This little purple mask that seems to have
small fake gems forming the outside, with a

796
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:05,207
couple of ribbons that dangle where it would tie around
the head. It's simple, but it's pretty.

797
01:02:05,207 --> 01:02:10,253
"Unfortunately, not many people bring children to
this side of the district. They don't sell very

798
01:02:10,253 --> 01:02:16,035
"well. But if you would like one, I would be happy
to part with for two gold?"

799
01:02:16,035 --> 01:02:20,453
WIL: One gold.

800
01:02:20,453 --> 01:02:25,350
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

801
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:26,745
WIL: 18.

802
01:02:26,745 --> 01:02:36,376
MATT: "One gold. Guess it is better to sell it
than not at all. Here you are. I must say, I won't

803
01:02:36,376 --> 01:02:45,953
"tell anyone, but purple is a pretty color on you."

804
01:02:45,953 --> 01:02:55,148
WIL: Yes, it is. He walks out.

805
01:02:55,148 --> 01:03:01,705
MATT: All right. A few moments pass as you wonder
where your dwarven leader has vanished to, he

806
01:03:01,705 --> 01:03:05,398
steps out through the front of the establishment.

807
01:03:05,398 --> 01:03:09,134
WIL: Let's go.

808
01:03:09,134 --> 01:03:16,502
ORION: Great. Do you have potions? Are you all
potioned up? Are you good on items, Thorbir?

809
01:03:16,502 --> 01:03:20,242
WIL: I'm all right. Are you all right?

810
01:03:20,242 --> 01:03:22,273
ORION: I'm just fine.

811
01:03:22,273 --> 01:03:27,640
LIAM: Well, we're in a rush, but if it's easy. How
do you come by potions in this town?

812
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,821
WIL: Do I know the answer to that?

813
01:03:29,821 --> 01:03:35,322
MATT: You do. They're either provided, from some
of your experience, by the Slayer's Take, but

814
01:03:35,322 --> 01:03:39,028
those are usually offered at the start of a
contract. The fact that they weren't offered on

815
01:03:39,028 --> 01:03:45,703
this means either they don't have any currently at
their disposal, or they felt that this contract

816
01:03:45,703 --> 01:03:53,475
probably wouldn't require it with the construct of
this group being set out. Other than that, they

817
01:03:53,475 --> 01:03:58,718
are a little hard to come by. A lot of them are
controlled by the main temples and are pretty much

818
01:03:58,718 --> 01:04:04,388
given straight to the Bastions. There aren't a
lot of individuals that are in need of them within

819
01:04:04,388 --> 01:04:09,000
the city, and those that travel out are either
members of the Slayer's Take or members of the

820
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,048
Bastion forces. So they are little hard to come
by.

821
01:04:13,048 --> 01:04:18,377
WIL: I think that if we're going to find them
anywhere, it might be around here. Might be we can

822
01:04:18,377 --> 01:04:23,716
take some through trade. Maybe some might fall off
a Bastion or two.

823
01:04:23,716 --> 01:04:27,318
ORION: Well, let's go talk to one then, shall we?

824
01:04:27,318 --> 01:04:30,735
WILL: Thought that's what we were doing. Are
going to the two Bastions over there or what?

825
01:04:30,735 --> 01:04:32,430
ORION: Yes, Kashaw.

826
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:37,599
WILL: Good. One other thing you need to know about
them: they're horribly paid, so money talks with

827
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:38,965
these people.

828
01:04:38,965 --> 01:04:40,592
ORION: Very well.

829
01:04:40,592 --> 01:04:48,601
MARISHA: As he goes ahead, I keep up my pace until
I trail behind him a little bit.

830
01:04:48,601 --> 01:04:50,806
WILL: Wonderful.

831
01:04:50,806 --> 01:04:54,502
LIAM: My hood goes up, and I'm gone.

832
01:04:54,502 --> 01:04:59,190
MATT: All right. As you guys step across the way.
It's about a block up. One of them is partially

833
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:02,662
inside the alley between two of the buildings. You
can see he has one hand up on the wall and the

834
01:05:02,662 --> 01:05:06,099
other down. One of them is relieving himself on
the side of the building, while the other is

835
01:05:06,099 --> 01:05:10,951
keeping watch, arms crossed, looking out across the
road. The one that's immediately present, or

836
01:05:10,951 --> 01:05:17,006
before you, you can see is human, a
scruffy brown beard around the edge of the chin.

837
01:05:17,006 --> 01:05:25,494
The hair itself is cut very short. A little
heavier in appearance. A little muscle, a little

838
01:05:25,494 --> 01:05:33,346
layer of winter padding, but the black leather
armor definitely gives you the appearance of

839
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:38,965
somebody who is a Bastion of the Raven Queen. As
you approach, the hooded half-elf, the dwarf

840
01:05:38,965 --> 01:05:46,367
walking with the giant axe, and the bumbling
dragonborn, the human cleric with a very angry

841
01:05:46,367 --> 01:05:53,680
disposition, and the awkward half-elf druid
stepping in pace with him. Gives you all a cursory

842
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,357
look and immediately puts a hand to his side where
you can see that there is a rapier currently

843
01:05:56,357 --> 01:06:01,009
sheathed. "Aye, you walk with purpose."

844
01:06:01,009 --> 01:06:04,395
WIL: We walk for the Guild.

845
01:06:04,395 --> 01:06:07,145
MATT: "Slayer's Take it is?"

846
01:06:07,145 --> 01:06:08,531
WIL: It is.

847
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:12,132
MATT: "What business have you on this side of
town, then? Aren't you supposed to be out past the

848
01:06:12,174 --> 01:06:13,966
"walls killing creatures and such?"

849
01:06:13,966 --> 01:06:17,583
WIL: Our business takes us where our business
takes us. Our business brings us here today.

850
01:06:17,583 --> 01:06:19,810
MATT: "All right, then what's your business?"

851
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:22,735
WIL: You might be having some trouble?

852
01:06:22,735 --> 01:06:24,927
MATT: "Aye."

853
01:06:24,927 --> 01:06:32,251
WIL: What's causing you trouble and what's going
to get us out of here might be the same thing.

854
01:06:32,251 --> 01:06:39,585
MATT: The gentleman to the left of him finishes
shaking off the rest of his alleyway journey.

855
01:06:39,585 --> 01:06:43,137
WILL: Any more than twice and you're just playing
with it, pal.

856
01:06:43,137 --> 01:06:53,384
MATT: He turns around and throws his tunic over.
"Excuse me, it's official Bastion business.

857
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:57,981
"Anyway." And he nods over to the bearded gentleman
who's standing there.

858
01:06:57,981 --> 01:07:06,657
"There are certain bits of business that are
official in this town. I don't know how honestly

859
01:07:06,657 --> 01:07:11,917
"right it is to be talking with common folk, or even the
Guild who does what it likes."

860
01:07:11,917 --> 01:07:15,698
WIL: I'm sorry, you're not talking to common
folk.

861
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,263
WILL: He wants money.

862
01:07:17,263 --> 01:07:20,003
WIL: I know what he wants.

863
01:07:20,003 --> 01:07:22,757
WILL: Well, then give to him so we can get out of
here.

864
01:07:22,757 --> 01:07:25,004
LIAM: I'm circling around.

865
01:07:25,004 --> 01:07:30,500
MATT: Make a stealth check.

866
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,719
LIAM: 31.

867
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:40,347
MATT: I'm not even going to roll. I'm going to ask
you to go ahead and you can choose if you want

868
01:07:40,347 --> 01:07:42,750
persuasion or intimidation on this. You're riding
that line.

869
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:52,281
WIL: I'm equally bad at both of them. But I think
that Thorbir wants to go intimidation. I'll give

870
01:07:52,281 --> 01:07:56,203
that a try. There it is!

871
01:07:56,203 --> 01:07:57,866
ORION: 20?

872
01:07:57,866 --> 01:08:00,586
WIL: What's the exact opposite of that?

873
01:08:00,586 --> 01:08:02,955
(laughter)

874
01:08:02,955 --> 01:08:06,585
MATT: You know, I've heard about it for so long.

875
01:08:06,585 --> 01:08:12,278
WIL: I know, right? You can't believe that it's a
real thing until you're actually there.

876
01:08:12,278 --> 01:08:16,090
LIAM: Everybody talks about spontaneous
combustion, but I'd never believed it.

877
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:24,062
WIL: It's silly. It's so silly to do this.

878
01:08:24,062 --> 01:08:25,698
MARISHA: Dice shame.

879
01:08:25,698 --> 01:08:28,397
LIAM: Naughty.

880
01:08:28,397 --> 01:08:36,626
MATT: I don't know what ancient Aztec deity's
temple you defaced when you were a child, but man.

881
01:08:36,626 --> 01:08:40,665
All right, so as you lean forward--

882
01:08:40,665 --> 01:08:42,599
WIL: Please, just let me step into a bucket.

883
01:08:42,599 --> 01:08:45,363
(laughter)

884
01:08:45,363 --> 01:08:53,436
MATT: We'll get to that. As you lean forward,
forcing your presence on this Bastion, his hand's

885
01:08:53,436 --> 01:08:58,742
still holding the edge of his rapier. He steps
forward into you, to the point where you're almost

886
01:08:58,742 --> 01:09:07,013
forehead to forehead. "Sorry, I have to lean down
to reach your level. But if you're going to go

887
01:09:07,013 --> 01:09:14,870
"about asking questions and not offering proper
compensation for information, well, then. I think

888
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:17,372
"we have no business here."

889
01:09:17,372 --> 01:09:26,929
WIL: If it's compensation you're looking for,
let's just speak plain. And I pull out four gold.

890
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:34,288
LIAM: And while he has their attention, I'm going
to check out his pockets.

891
01:09:34,288 --> 01:09:39,824
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

892
01:09:39,824 --> 01:09:47,085
LIAM: Ew, that's not good. I'm going to use Luck.
That's better. That's all right. Perception, you

893
01:09:47,085 --> 01:09:48,368
said? 28.

894
01:09:48,368 --> 01:09:53,556
MATT: 28? Taking a moment as you sneak up behind the
one he's talking to-- the two guys are shoulder to

895
01:09:53,583 --> 01:09:57,693
shoulder, squaring off with the rest of this
group. The one that had been relieving himself in

896
01:09:57,744 --> 01:10:02,581
the alleyway is a little bit closer to you. You
can see as he put his tunic right and everything,

897
01:10:02,581 --> 01:10:06,997
he jostled around and revealed a couple of small
pouches on his side. One of which, you heard

898
01:10:06,997 --> 01:10:10,518
a clinking of glass on the inside. Go ahead and make
a sleight-of-hand check.

899
01:10:10,518 --> 01:10:15,089
MARISHA: Go rogue, go.

900
01:10:15,089 --> 01:10:19,909
LIAM: Because I'm wearing a Cloak of Elvenkind,
which I know affects stealth checks but not--

901
01:10:19,909 --> 01:10:21,896
MATT: Not sleight of hand, no.

902
01:10:21,896 --> 01:10:24,276
LIAM: That's all right. 20.

903
01:10:24,276 --> 01:10:35,620
MATT: 20. All right. You reach over and find the
edge of the leather loop that attaches itself to

904
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:40,654
the side of this Bastion's belt. You tug ever
so gently to the side and the loop releases and

905
01:10:40,654 --> 01:10:55,006
you pull it off, seemingly without any noticing.
As you pull out the four gold from inside, the

906
01:10:55,006 --> 01:11:01,174
Bastion looks out and scoffs and goes, "Clearly,
pittance fee for this. What's to let me think

907
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:05,992
"that you aren't actually part of this murder
scheme? You just walk up and try and start asking

908
01:11:05,992 --> 01:11:10,543
"questions like this. First off, where did you hear
about it? Second, you look like the kind that

909
01:11:10,543 --> 01:11:14,962
"would go ahead and be mauling folks in the street,
do you not, sir dwarf? You got the eyes of one

910
01:11:14,962 --> 01:11:17,329
"who's probably done a few dark deeds."

911
01:11:17,329 --> 01:11:22,050
WIL: Oh, I have. More than you can imagine.

912
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:25,162
MATT: "Then explain to me why we shouldn't take
you in for questioning right now." And he pulls

913
01:11:25,162 --> 01:11:26,994
his rapier out.

914
01:11:26,994 --> 01:11:35,010
ORION: Hold on. Everybody calm down. Hi, I'm
Tiberius Stormwind. My friend Thorbir here

915
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,060
didn't mean to offend, of course.

916
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:45,587
MATT: The blade up toward your face. And he says,
"Look, dragon man, I was talking to the dwarf.

917
01:11:45,587 --> 01:11:53,913
"You, I have no business with at the moment. So.
You've got ten seconds before we take you in."

918
01:11:53,913 --> 01:12:08,754
WIL: I reach into my pocket and rattle my coins
around a little bit. Maybe I could buy us some

919
01:12:08,754 --> 01:12:14,749
time. And I drop ten gold out into my other hand.

920
01:12:14,749 --> 01:12:22,915
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

921
01:12:22,915 --> 01:12:24,910
WILL: One! No, it isn't.

922
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:26,551
MATT: Three.

923
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:34,339
WIL: That's funny. I rolled a three on this die.
So that's going to be a six. Guys, I think we're

924
01:12:34,339 --> 01:12:37,660
fighting the Bastions. I feel like maybe it's
going that way.

925
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:39,240
MARISHA: You rolled a one?

926
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,593
MATT: I rolled one.

927
01:12:40,593 --> 01:12:44,136
MARISHA: You all have really low self-confidence.

928
01:12:44,136 --> 01:12:50,830
MATT: As you push forward the coins, in a
semi-awkward forceful manner, the Bastion himself

929
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:56,365
also seems to be caught off-guard, and looks down,
and looks about. Realizing that now it looks like

930
01:12:56,365 --> 01:13:02,812
you are visibly out in the open, paying money to
the Bastions. He looks back. "People don't stand

931
01:13:02,812 --> 01:13:07,231
"out in public and do it!" And he pulls you all off
into the alleyway to the side of the complex. Out

932
01:13:07,231 --> 01:13:12,425
of the middle of the area into the shade between
the buildings. He reaches over and takes the coins

933
01:13:12,425 --> 01:13:22,367
from your hand and hurries them into a pocket.
"All right, look. I'll tell you what we know. But

934
01:13:22,367 --> 01:13:25,387
"if you're going to be messing around with this
investigation, I ask that you don't let anyone

935
01:13:25,387 --> 01:13:30,804
"know that you spoke with us. This is all on your
own. And if you do say anything, we'll deny it and

936
01:13:30,804 --> 01:13:35,415
"we'll make sure to put you in the Oubliette
yourself for this. All right?"

937
01:13:35,415 --> 01:13:36,612
ORION: Fair enough.

938
01:13:36,612 --> 01:13:38,609
WIL and WILL: All right.

939
01:13:38,609 --> 01:13:46,067
MATT: "Now, we have found a series of bodies over
the past few years, scattered about. A few months at

940
01:13:46,067 --> 01:13:53,370
"a time between. All with a similar pattern of death
to them. We found large portions, the meaty

941
01:13:53,370 --> 01:14:00,121
"portions of the body had been torn away, some of
them apparently eaten. There are marks that are

942
01:14:00,121 --> 01:14:06,910
"indicative of some sort of beast ravaging the
corpses, but no signs of a beast coming or going.

943
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:10,681
"And we've had many of our finest trackers looking
for any sort of sign of a creature that may have

944
01:14:10,681 --> 01:14:15,754
"found its way into the city. They've been in the
rooftops, the gutters, perhaps even the sewers. No

945
01:14:15,754 --> 01:14:20,852
"sign of any such creature traveling amongst any of
these scenes.

946
01:14:20,852 --> 01:14:27,786
"Now, all of the bodies have been found wrapped up
and discarded in the canals. A lot of them

947
01:14:27,786 --> 01:14:35,326
"surrounding the Abundant Terrace." Looks at the
rest of you. "That's where Melora's eye is

948
01:14:35,326 --> 01:14:45,182
"watchful. What's really got us confused of late
is, the most recent murder that we found was a

949
01:14:45,182 --> 01:14:50,802
"very powerful merchant lord from Ank'harel, one
that's been in this city for no more than a month.

950
01:14:50,802 --> 01:14:56,317
"He's well-known in these parts as bringing in a lot
of business. His caravans come through via

951
01:14:56,317 --> 01:15:03,000
"various skyships. And he brings with himself an
influx of much-needed mercantile in the city."

952
01:15:03,003 --> 01:15:04,835
MARISHA: What's his name?

953
01:15:04,835 --> 01:15:08,128
MATT: "I'm not allowed to say."

954
01:15:08,128 --> 01:15:11,225
WILL: You're not allowed to say?

955
01:15:11,225 --> 01:15:15,415
MATT: "The merchant's name is Tyrell."

956
01:15:15,415 --> 01:15:17,214
MARISHA: What?

957
01:15:17,214 --> 01:15:24,644
MATT: "Tyrell. Lord Tyrell. If you say any of this
to any of our people, I swear I'll make your life

958
01:15:24,644 --> 01:15:29,129
"the hardest it's been in months. And from the
looks of you, you've had a very hard few months.

959
01:15:29,129 --> 01:15:39,851
"Lord Tyrell's body was found, but apparently
during the murder. We have one beggar that

960
01:15:39,851 --> 01:15:45,203
"apparently caught sight of this the murderer. 
As best as we can tell, it was some sort of

961
01:15:45,203 --> 01:15:50,975
"lycanthrope. The beggar was babbling, but it
seemed there was some sort of wolf-like creature.

962
01:15:50,975 --> 01:15:56,572
"It was seen bipedal walking a man, but tore this
man right through the throat, most of his chest.

963
01:15:56,572 --> 01:16:06,260
"But when spotted, didn't run, just vanished.
Disappeared. No longer in his sight. No tracks

964
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:16,469
"left behind. Just gone. Didn't know if it was
angry poltergeist, ghost. But the last place he

965
01:16:16,469 --> 01:16:24,385
"was staying is at a recent establishment, only
been here a couple of years. Referred to as

966
01:16:24,385 --> 01:16:31,640
"the Velvet Cabaret. The Velvet Cabaret 
is a very high-end place."

967
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:32,983
WILL: I know it well.

968
01:16:32,983 --> 01:16:35,300
MATT: "You do?" He gives you a look of--

969
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:38,310
WILL: I've heard about it from somewhere else.

970
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:40,456
ORION: Scanlan? Have you been talking to Scanlan?

971
01:16:40,456 --> 01:16:43,876
WILL: Don't know who that is, Stormshadow.

972
01:16:43,876 --> 01:16:47,407
ORION: He likes whores. Okay. It's weird.

973
01:16:47,407 --> 01:16:54,068
MATT: "The fact that that the lord had been
staying at the Velvet Cabaret for some time, and

974
01:16:54,068 --> 01:16:59,307
"we were feeling pretty close to possibly finding
the source of these murders. Our bastion force

975
01:16:59,307 --> 01:17:06,855
"from the Duskmeadow worked with the Quadroads and
we actually raided it. Found nothing. Nothing but

976
01:17:06,855 --> 01:17:13,368
"the patrons, no sign of any sort of foul play. We
were forced to leave empty handed. That's all

977
01:17:13,368 --> 01:17:16,105
"we've got."

978
01:17:16,105 --> 01:17:18,685
WILL: I have a question about the bodies. Have you
seen them?

979
01:17:18,685 --> 01:17:21,396
MATT: "I've only seen the most recent. The rest,
I've just heard of."

980
01:17:21,396 --> 01:17:25,633
WILL: Anything similar with them? Are they all
men? Are they all women? Are they children?

981
01:17:25,633 --> 01:17:34,527
MATT: "No children. Most of them seem to be well
off to do folk. Dressed well."

982
01:17:34,527 --> 01:17:39,729
WILL: Wealthy men and women? And you say you've
searched everywhere, including the catacombs?

983
01:17:39,729 --> 01:17:44,771
MATT: "Most. Catacombs themselves are sealed off.
We've asked around, and there's been no sign of

984
01:17:44,771 --> 01:17:48,572
"movement in or out. And gods forbid, anyone stays
in those places.

"That's a nasty place to be staying."

986
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,009
WILL: It is, indeed.

987
01:17:52,009 --> 01:17:58,997
ORION: Is there a way that the bastions could
organize some kind of gathering of sorts? Perhaps

988
01:17:58,997 --> 01:18:04,088
a mandatory town meeting, where all would have 
to gather for maybe

989
01:18:04,088 --> 01:18:06,843
an announcement or something official?

990
01:18:06,843 --> 01:18:11,882
MATT: "All the bastions? That's near impossible.
The city's scattered politically enough as it

991
01:18:11,882 --> 01:18:19,095
"is. People can be rallying whenever there's some
sort of force coming against the city. But when it

992
01:18:19,095 --> 01:18:24,294
"comes to nothing for any particular reason, just
the investigators take care of it themselves."

993
01:18:24,294 --> 01:18:28,202
WIL: He serves the Raven Queen, right? He's got
the Raven Queen patch on him?

994
01:18:28,202 --> 01:18:29,223
MATT: Yeah.

995
01:18:29,223 --> 01:18:38,397
WIL: This part of town, death isn't the worst
thing in the world. Lots of planes other than

996
01:18:38,397 --> 01:18:45,252
ours, might be you're a little bit closer than
some of the rest of us are; we're underneath the

997
01:18:45,252 --> 01:18:54,290
mountain. You wouldn't happen to know about anyone
performing any rituals or maybe opening up lines

998
01:18:54,290 --> 01:19:01,512
of communication that may have been made and
disturbed?

999
01:19:01,512 --> 01:19:07,392
MATT: "I certainly hope not. These sort of
communion rituals are sanctified and held within

1000
01:19:07,392 --> 01:19:14,779
"the actual temple to the Raven Queen itself. If
anyone is doing any sort of business, there is a

unsanctioned,

"I can guarantee we'll know about it."

1003
01:19:27,415 --> 01:19:32,343
ORION: May we seek audience with this Raven
Queen?

1004
01:19:32,343 --> 01:19:35,740
MARISHA: I mean, she's a goddess.

1005
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:37,609
ORION: Oh. She's not here?

1006
01:19:37,609 --> 01:19:40,988
MARISHA: She's not a queen. She's a goddess.

1007
01:19:40,988 --> 01:19:44,556
MATT: You can see the two the two bastions are
looking at each other with expression of

1008
01:19:44,556 --> 01:19:46,373
"Really?"

1009
01:19:46,373 --> 01:19:48,787
ORION: We're new around here.

1010
01:19:48,787 --> 01:19:51,657
MATT: "Listen, we've talked long enough. We got to
get back to our posts."

1011
01:19:51,657 --> 01:19:56,153
MARISHA: Oh, wait. You mentioned investigators?

1012
01:19:56,153 --> 01:20:00,680
MATT: "There are different people assigned to
investigate. We were part of the team that was

1013
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:03,828
"sent as part of the investigation raid on the
Velvet Cabaret."

1014
01:20:03,828 --> 01:20:09,771
MARISHA: It's not a group of people. It's just,
"you're an investigator today" kind of thing?

1015
01:20:09,771 --> 01:20:12,043
MATT: "That's part of what we do as Bastions,
aye."

1016
01:20:12,043 --> 01:20:15,159
MARISHA: Gotcha. Is there anyone else that is part
of the investigation team that you think would be

1017
01:20:15,159 --> 01:20:16,746
good to talk to?

1018
01:20:16,746 --> 01:20:19,190
MATT: "They wouldn't have any more information
than we do, no."

1019
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:21,211
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check on him?

1020
01:20:21,211 --> 01:20:23,776
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

1021
01:20:23,776 --> 01:20:27,580
MARISHA: 23.

1022
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:33,328
MATT: He seems forthright enough. He seems
impatient and a little flustered with the fact

1023
01:20:33,328 --> 01:20:35,959
that you've been pushing these questions to him.
But he doesn't

1024
01:20:35,959 --> 01:20:38,339
seem to be covering anything necessarily.

1025
01:20:38,339 --> 01:20:41,640
WIL: Did he tell us where they found the-- I
didn't write this down.

1026
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:47,141
LIAM: And Lord Tyrell factored in how?

1027
01:20:47,141 --> 01:20:52,480
WIL: Can you tell us where you found the body of
the merchant lord?

1028
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:58,750
MATT: "The body was found in the side alley to the
Velvet Cabaret."

1029
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:03,280
WILL: You said wrapped up? Or just the ones in the
river were wrapped up?

1030
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:08,239
MATT: "The ones that were found in the river, they
were wrapped up in blankets. Whatever put them

1031
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:13,191
"aside was not some beast. There was some
intelligence to this. And they were placed

1032
01:21:13,191 --> 01:21:17,968
"deliberately, which means, I don't think there's
just one thing doing this."

1033
01:21:17,968 --> 01:21:20,280
WILL: Were the blankets the same, or were they all
different?

1034
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:30,060
MATT: "They seemed to be different. Some were just
scattered cloths. Some were tattered sheets. Some

1035
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:35,532
"were bolts of fine material. Really varied. There
was no pattern to it."

1036
01:21:35,532 --> 01:21:40,556
WILL: Was anything missing from Lord Tyrell?

1037
01:21:40,556 --> 01:21:45,859
MATT: "Nothing more than his throat, his
trachea."

1038
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:51,647
LIAM: We've pumped these guys for all they've
got.

1039
01:21:51,647 --> 01:21:56,159
WIL: You're all right. Sorry about that.

1040
01:21:56,159 --> 01:22:06,312
MATT: "It's all right, just offer more coin up
front next time. Be well. And if you hear

1041
01:22:06,312 --> 01:22:12,663
"anything, find any information, come straight to
us. Don't be getting into official business.

1042
01:22:12,663 --> 01:22:20,859
"You're sanctified as a Slayer, but don't make us
look bad." They step around you guys, back out

1043
01:22:20,859 --> 01:22:23,017
into the main street.

1044
01:22:23,017 --> 01:22:24,355
WIL: Velvet Cabaret?

1045
01:22:24,355 --> 01:22:25,910
MARISHA: Velvet Cabaret.

1046
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:27,229
WILL: It's close.

1047
01:22:27,229 --> 01:22:35,923
MARISHA: So we know that this guy-- while we walk
there, I was talking. We know that this guy is a

1048
01:22:35,923 --> 01:22:41,860
demon from the Nine Hells. So, he seems to be
targeting wealthy people. Do you think these are

1049
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:48,762
people that tried to get under his control, under
his servitude, and it didn't go his way, so he

1050
01:22:48,762 --> 01:22:50,839
ended up killing them?

1051
01:22:50,839 --> 01:22:58,732
WIL: Folk don't go into the Velvet Cabaret unless
they got a lot of coin. Someone like Lord Tyrell.

1052
01:22:58,732 --> 01:23:01,969
Do we know anything about him? Does his name ring
any bells for us at all?

1053
01:23:01,969 --> 01:23:03,247
MATT: Roll a history check.

1054
01:23:03,247 --> 01:23:12,259
WIL: Oh boy. (laughs) It happened again!

1055
01:23:12,259 --> 01:23:17,561
MATT: This is unprecedented. You are the
nega-Percy right now.

1056
01:23:17,561 --> 01:23:20,633
WIL: Just telling you. I'm just telling you.

1057
01:23:20,633 --> 01:23:22,341
MATT: This is impressive.

1058
01:23:22,341 --> 01:23:26,620
WIL: You think it isn't real. You think it's a
thing I make jokes about.

1059
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:33,255
MATT: You take a moment to conjecture where you
may have heard the name. What was the name again?

1060
01:23:33,255 --> 01:23:42,325
WIL: Oh, the guy from Battlestar Galactica. 
Oh, what was his name? Adama?

1061
01:23:42,325 --> 01:23:46,034
MATT: You want to roll a history check?

1062
01:23:46,034 --> 01:23:47,897
WILL: d20?

1063
01:23:47,897 --> 01:23:50,419
MATT: d20 and add your history modifier.

1064
01:23:50,419 --> 01:23:54,287
WILL: Add my history. 20. Total of 20.

1065
01:23:54,287 --> 01:24:00,591
MATT: Total is 20? All right. You've heard of the
city of Ank'Harel. It's a desert city from a long

1066
01:24:00,591 --> 01:24:06,212
ways away. But you aren't specifically aware of
this individual. You however, Kashaw, you know

1067
01:24:06,212 --> 01:24:16,556
that Lord Tyrell has come through this city a few
times in the past year or so. You've only been

1068
01:24:16,556 --> 01:24:22,372
here a short time yourself, but in the time that
you've been here, you've heard tales of this large

1069
01:24:22,372 --> 01:24:27,953
caravan that comes through. And it is a parade. He
usually brings with him a good 13 different carts

1070
01:24:27,953 --> 01:24:40,150
that contain all sorts of jewels and materials and
tapestries and fine silks, and it's almost a small

1071
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:46,822
party whenever this is this long walking caravan
is brought into the city. So you are aware of this

1072
01:24:46,822 --> 01:24:50,824
individual. You're surprised that the death has be
kept so hush-hush.

1073
01:24:50,824 --> 01:24:54,312
WILL: And are there rumors of about him bring in
anything else? Anything illicit? Or is it kind of

1074
01:24:54,312 --> 01:24:55,735
"what you see is what you get?"

1075
01:24:55,735 --> 01:24:59,927
MATT: As far as you know? No information that has
caught your ear per se, but the fact that he's

1076
01:24:59,927 --> 01:25:01,413
staying in this district, who knows?

1077
01:25:01,413 --> 01:25:10,140
WIL: Folks tend to stay-- Let me try that again.
Folk tend to stay with their own class. These

1078
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:18,388
victims are all wealthy folk. And they seem to
have the Velvet Cabaret in common. It's very

1079
01:25:18,388 --> 01:25:24,716
likely that we're dealing with somebody who is
rich and powerful.

1080
01:25:24,716 --> 01:25:26,866
WILL: What does a demon need money for?

1081
01:25:26,866 --> 01:25:28,636
WIL: Who says he's after money?

1082
01:25:28,636 --> 01:25:31,493
MARISHA: Seems to be after power.

1083
01:25:31,493 --> 01:25:35,992
LIAM: Tyrell was passing through. I wonder how
many people would notice him gone

1084
01:25:35,992 --> 01:25:37,992
here in Vasselheim.

1085
01:25:37,992 --> 01:25:39,322
ORION: I'm sure quite a few.

1086
01:25:39,322 --> 01:25:42,637
MARISHA: And it seems like it's no secret when he
comes to town.

1087
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:44,371
WILL: It was a party every time he showed up.

1088
01:25:44,371 --> 01:25:48,935
MARISHA: And according to the guards, these
murders have been going on for the past few years,

1089
01:25:48,935 --> 01:25:56,404
so it seems like whatever we're dealing with might
have time to plan ahead. If he's been aware of the

1090
01:25:56,404 --> 01:26:02,251
past few times that Tyrell has come through the
town and could possibly know the next time he's

1091
01:26:02,251 --> 01:26:04,242
coming through.

1092
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:10,266
ORION: And if we could pinpoint when it actually
started, we know years, but actually when, then we

1093
01:26:10,266 --> 01:26:14,887
can actually narrow it down to the establishments
and other things that were established then.

1094
01:26:14,887 --> 01:26:21,598
WIL: Would there be a place where we could inquire
as to some sort of ledger like that when this guy

1095
01:26:21,598 --> 01:26:27,765
comes in and with the intention of trying to
correlate it with when different murders have

1096
01:26:27,765 --> 01:26:34,496
happened? Actually, I take that back. Thorbir
doesn't think that deeply. That's not the thing

1097
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:40,947
that he wants to do. That sounds like a lot of
thinking and not a lot of hitting things.

1098
01:26:40,947 --> 01:26:47,162
LIAM: This killer could be hiding in plain sight 
at the Cabaret. Could be an employee there.

1099
01:26:47,162 --> 01:26:49,172
ORION: Or the owner himself.

1100
01:26:49,172 --> 01:26:55,277
MARISHA: How long ago did the bastions say that
they raided the Velvet Cabaret?

1101
01:26:55,277 --> 01:26:57,191
WILL: It was a month ago, wasn't it?

1102
01:26:57,191 --> 01:27:00,231
MATT: It was a few weeks back when the murder
occurred, yeah.

1103
01:27:00,231 --> 01:27:06,009
MARISHA: So here's my question: do you think he
would stick around after it was raided? Or do you

1104
01:27:06,009 --> 01:27:07,154
think he'd move on?

1105
01:27:07,154 --> 01:27:09,174
LIAM: The thing is vanishing upon sight.

1106
01:27:09,174 --> 01:27:13,982
WILL: And gotten away with it for the last two or
three years. I don't think he cares much anymore.

1107
01:27:13,982 --> 01:27:20,518
LIAM: My question is: we have three days,
Cabaret's the only lead we have. How do we draw

1108
01:27:20,518 --> 01:27:23,191
this person, he or she, out?

1109
01:27:23,191 --> 01:27:26,778
MARISHA: I believe it is three days.

1110
01:27:26,778 --> 01:27:30,080
LIAM: We have three days to collar it.

1111
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:35,777
MATT: You have three days to complete the
contract, meaning slaying the entity you're

1112
01:27:35,777 --> 01:27:37,124
contracted to.

1113
01:27:37,124 --> 01:27:39,802
WILL: I was going to say that you look like a man
who knows wealth.

1114
01:27:39,802 --> 01:27:40,986
ORION: Yes.

1115
01:27:40,986 --> 01:27:42,955
LIAM: I've spent time with wealth.

1116
01:27:42,955 --> 01:27:48,841
WILL: Well, I never have, so I would think maybe
if you were a merchant coming into

1117
01:27:48,841 --> 01:27:51,869
town, very wealthy, looking for some adult
entertainment,

1118
01:27:51,869 --> 01:27:56,133
might be a way to bring him out the forefront.

1119
01:27:56,133 --> 01:28:03,204
ORION: Oh, I agree. I cast Alter Self on myself
and turn myself into an elf.

1120
01:28:03,204 --> 01:28:04,609
You're half-elf right?

1121
01:28:04,609 --> 01:28:05,721
LIAM: Half-elves.

1122
01:28:05,721 --> 01:28:13,427
ORION: I'll turn into a half-elf, akin to a
high-born half elf.

1123
01:28:13,427 --> 01:28:18,057
MATT: All right, fair enough. Even in comparison
to Vax, your attire is very nice.

1124
01:28:18,057 --> 01:28:20,367
MARISHA: Does this mean that I should go change
clothes?

1125
01:28:20,367 --> 01:28:22,845
WILL: You were going to go shopping.

1126
01:28:22,845 --> 01:28:23,748
MARISHA: I was.

1127
01:28:23,748 --> 01:28:26,484
ORION: You look okay.

1128
01:28:26,484 --> 01:28:27,841
MARISHA: Thank you.

1129
01:28:27,841 --> 01:28:32,285
LIAM: Let's go. I jingle what gold I have in a
pouch in front of Keyleth's face and say, let's go

1130
01:28:32,285 --> 01:28:33,934
shopping. Come on.

1131
01:28:33,934 --> 01:28:35,158
WIL: Shopping montage.

1132
01:28:35,158 --> 01:28:41,974
MATT: As you guys go out shopping for better
looking, well-to-do attire, we'll go ahead and

1133
01:28:41,974 --> 01:28:44,517
take a quick five-minute break and we'll return
here and as you guys continue to the next step of

1134
01:28:44,517 --> 01:28:49,389
your hunt for the rakshasa.

1135
01:28:49,389 --> 01:28:54,775
WIL: Oh, Tyrell! I just remembered.

1136
01:28:54,775 --> 01:29:00,980
(laughter)

1137
01:29:00,980 --> 01:29:03,557
WIL: What a silly thing to forget.

1138
01:29:03,557 --> 01:29:09,535
LIAM: As the rakshasa bears down on your head.

1139
01:29:09,535 --> 01:29:14,356
MATT: Last thing engraved on your tombstone. Yeah,
quick five-minute break. First off, before we get

1140
01:29:14,356 --> 01:29:20,754
to that, guys: A big thank you to Negihama once
again, our patron saint of ridiculous gifts, who

1141
01:29:20,754 --> 01:29:23,311
purchased these sconces to put on the wall.

1142
01:29:23,311 --> 01:29:24,753
LIAM: They're legit.

1143
01:29:24,753 --> 01:29:26,064
MARISHA: Aren't the sconces awesome?

1144
01:29:26,064 --> 01:29:27,793
MATT: They are amazing.

1145
01:29:27,793 --> 01:29:29,236
MARISHA: The LEDs change colors.

1146
01:29:29,236 --> 01:29:33,036
MATT: Reminder: every hundred subs we're
giving away a signed picture and signed full-scale

1147
01:29:33,036 --> 01:29:37,525
poster of Kit's art. And for the break, the
five-minute break we're going to take real fast,

1148
01:29:37,525 --> 01:29:41,182
we have an awesome video that was presented to us
by some of the Critters that I think you'll also

1149
01:29:41,182 --> 01:29:43,762
appreciate as well. So we'll go ahead roll that
and use the potty

1150
01:29:43,762 --> 01:29:46,556
and we'll see you guys in a few minutes.

1151
01:29:46,556 --> 01:29:55,728
[break]

1152
01:39:54,334 --> 01:39:57,188
MATT: Welcome back. I assume we'll have a Liam
here in just a moment.

1153
01:39:57,188 --> 01:39:59,274
ORION: He's just stealthing.

1154
01:39:59,274 --> 01:40:02,846
WILL: He's stealthing. He rolled a 28 
and disappeared.

1155
01:40:02,846 --> 01:40:12,617
WIL: I was talking Liam's ear off during the break
about how much I love the dynamic among the three

1156
01:40:12,617 --> 01:40:20,186
of you, and commiserating about how you feel
really naked and exposed when your whole party

1157
01:40:20,186 --> 01:40:26,285
isn't together. How weird that feels to not have
everybody together at the same time. I think I

1158
01:40:26,285 --> 01:40:28,198
kept him from the bathroom.

1159
01:40:28,198 --> 01:40:34,318
MATT: Oh, gotcha. That's okay. He'll arrive. When
he comes, we'll all awkwardly stare. Yeah. When he

1160
01:40:34,318 --> 01:40:42,228
does. When he arrives we'll all just-- But in the
meantime, you managed to go back and--

1161
01:40:42,228 --> 01:40:50,511
LIAM: Stealth. Disadvantage on my next five
attacks.

1162
01:40:50,511 --> 01:40:52,599
(laughter)

1163
01:40:52,599 --> 01:40:54,649
WILL: I love the awkward stare. It was great.

1164
01:40:54,649 --> 01:40:59,336
WIL: He's actually a very generous DM if he does
that. I actually make my players roll damage when

1165
01:40:59,336 --> 01:41:01,069
they upset me.

1166
01:41:01,069 --> 01:41:03,161
MATT: Oh, that's good to know.

1167
01:41:03,161 --> 01:41:06,680
WIL: Yeah, dude, d6 damage if you annoy the GM.

1168
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:14,059
MATT: Wrath of the gods comes down upon you. All
right, so you guys taken a few minutes to acquire

1169
01:41:14,059 --> 01:41:22,214
outfits that seem a little more fitting as to the
establishment you're planning to go and enter.

1170
01:41:22,295 --> 01:41:25,584
MARISHA: Guys, we should have aliases. Can we have
aliases?

1171
01:41:25,584 --> 01:41:27,354
WIL: Yeah, I'll be Thorbir.

1172
01:41:27,354 --> 01:41:29,937
WILL: I like it. It's easy to remember.

1173
01:41:29,937 --> 01:41:38,232
MARISHA: Very easy. Oh, you know what, maybe I
could-- would it be weird if I'm Vex? That's

1174
01:41:38,232 --> 01:41:40,651
weird, isn't it?

1175
01:41:40,651 --> 01:41:42,945
LIAM: That's really weird.

1176
01:41:42,945 --> 01:41:48,707
MARISHA: Okay. What's a good elven name? What's
something common in Elven? You were around this

1177
01:41:48,707 --> 01:41:56,819
stuff. All of my people have weird tribal names.
What's good?

1178
01:41:56,819 --> 01:42:01,595
LIAM: Elivr is nice. Coralin.

1179
01:42:01,595 --> 01:42:05,509
MARISHA: Oh, Coralin. Do I look like a Coralin?

1180
01:42:05,509 --> 01:42:07,300
WILL: What does a Coralin look like?

1181
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:10,861
ORION: She does that. Just agree.

1182
01:42:10,861 --> 01:42:15,629
LIAM: I will be Scanlan Shorthalt.

1183
01:42:15,629 --> 01:42:21,049
MARISHA: (stutters) What, you can be Scanlan, but
I couldn't be Vex?

1184
01:42:21,049 --> 01:42:25,342
LIAM: No, you can't do that. I'm just saying 
it's weird.

1185
01:42:25,342 --> 01:42:28,085
MARISHA: That's double standard, Vax. I'm just
saying.

1186
01:42:28,085 --> 01:42:33,288
ORION: I think it's maybe because you're not his
sister and it would be weird because that's his

1187
01:42:33,288 --> 01:42:34,517
sister's name.

1188
01:42:34,517 --> 01:42:36,286
WILL: You have a sister?

1189
01:42:36,286 --> 01:42:38,256
LIAM: I have a twin, yes.

1190
01:42:38,256 --> 01:42:43,564
WILL: What does she look like? Oh.

1191
01:42:43,564 --> 01:42:46,177
ORION: But she's a female.

1192
01:42:46,177 --> 01:42:48,209
WILL: She sounds lovely.

1193
01:42:48,209 --> 01:42:50,128
WIL: Humans, am I right?

1194
01:42:50,128 --> 01:42:52,294
MARISHA: She's very nice.

1195
01:42:52,294 --> 01:42:55,724
WILL: That's what they say about all the ugly
girls. "She's very nice."

1196
01:42:59,604 --> 01:43:04,164
MARISHA: I feel like I'm learning so much from
you. Is that what they say?

1197
01:43:04,164 --> 01:43:07,181
ORION: Life lessons, yes.

1198
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:09,495
WILL: Velvet Cabaret?

1199
01:43:09,495 --> 01:43:12,242
LIAM: To the Cabaret.

1200
01:43:12,242 --> 01:43:16,848
WIL: I presume that I'll play the role of your
guard.

1201
01:43:16,848 --> 01:43:18,606
LIAM: Bodyguard, yes.

1202
01:43:18,606 --> 01:43:24,520
WILL: What does that make me? How about your
valet? You'll need one if you're wealthy. Would

1203
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:25,933
you have a human, though?

1204
01:43:25,933 --> 01:43:32,162
LIAM: Of course. Of course I'll have a human,
being elven.

1205
01:43:32,162 --> 01:43:35,078
ORION: Are we on our way there now?

1206
01:43:35,078 --> 01:43:40,175
LIAM: Yeah, we're walking and talking. And you're
changed into a gnome.

1207
01:43:40,175 --> 01:43:42,786
ORION: Now I change. I change, because it only
lasts a certain amount of time.

1208
01:43:42,786 --> 01:43:44,269
LIAM: Boy or girl?

1209
01:43:44,269 --> 01:43:45,984
ORION: I'm a boy.

1210
01:43:45,984 --> 01:43:49,791
WILL: So are you Lord Vax?

1211
01:43:49,791 --> 01:43:53,259
LIAM: Lord Scanlan of the Shorthalts.

1212
01:43:53,259 --> 01:43:58,953
WILL: Lord Scanlan, okay. Lord Scanlan of the--
I'm sorry, of the what?

1213
01:43:58,953 --> 01:43:59,997
LIAM: Of the Shorthalts.

1214
01:43:59,997 --> 01:44:03,194
WILL: Of the Shorthalts. Okay.

1215
01:44:03,194 --> 01:44:06,806
LIAM: We have a cobbling empire. Shoes.

1216
01:44:06,806 --> 01:44:13,401
WILL: The Shorthalts. Okay. Lord Scanlan of the
Shorthalts.

1217
01:44:13,401 --> 01:44:19,717
LIAM: We cater mostly to halflings and gnomes.
Everyone, but specifically because they're so

1218
01:44:19,717 --> 01:44:20,775
underserved.

1219
01:44:20,775 --> 01:44:23,188
WILL: You have a gnome shoe empire?

1220
01:44:23,188 --> 01:44:25,642
LIAM: Rolling in it, baby.

1221
01:44:25,642 --> 01:44:29,381
WIL: Where's your empire, human?

1222
01:44:29,381 --> 01:44:31,703
WILL: I have no empire. I'm his valet.

1223
01:44:31,703 --> 01:44:34,361
LIAM: We're wonderful partners, dear.

1224
01:44:34,361 --> 01:44:36,219
MARISHA: Am I your wife?

1225
01:44:36,219 --> 01:44:40,834
LIAM: Do you want to be? Is that weird?

1226
01:44:40,834 --> 01:44:44,055
MARISHA: No.

1227
01:44:44,055 --> 01:44:46,813
ORION: I say it's equally-- no, it's fine.

1228
01:44:46,813 --> 01:44:52,602
MARISHA: No, it's fine. Yeah, I can be your
wife. I can RP this. I mean I can pretend to be.

1229
01:44:52,602 --> 01:44:58,663
Yeah. So Coralin Shorthalt.

1230
01:44:58,663 --> 01:45:01,717
WIL: Thorbir is pulling on his beard and breathing
deeply.

1231
01:45:01,717 --> 01:45:05,177
ORION: Now I cast Alter Self.

1232
01:45:05,177 --> 01:45:09,527
MATT: All right. Cast and a flash of light. You
guys all pick up the very, very heavy smell of

1233
01:45:09,527 --> 01:45:13,179
breakfast ale emanating from the deeply breathing,
angry dwarf.

1234
01:45:13,179 --> 01:45:17,310
ORION: Wait, Vax. What was my role in this?

1235
01:45:17,310 --> 01:45:21,664
LIAM: You're an advisor. A financial advisor.

1236
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:23,217
ORION: Financial advisor. Excellent.

1237
01:45:23,217 --> 01:45:32,336
MATT: All right. You guys make your way to a
little bit further north this of this route, five

1238
01:45:32,336 --> 01:45:36,015
or six blocks until you get the outskirts of the
Velvet Cabaret, which based on the description

1239
01:45:36,015 --> 01:45:39,439
you've gotten from a few individuals you asked
around, very easy to find. The fancy house of

1240
01:45:39,439 --> 01:45:46,353
entertainment. It is a two-story building of dark
cherry wood with strips of what looks to be black

1241
01:45:46,353 --> 01:45:53,496
suede bolted in a pattern along the outside of it.
It stands out like a sore thumb against the rest

1242
01:45:53,496 --> 01:46:03,196
of the architecture, but it looks a night club. It
looks very, very gaudy, but in a way that the

1243
01:46:03,196 --> 01:46:08,582
garishness looks expensive, and so you can't
really fault it for looking the way it does.

1244
01:46:08,582 --> 01:46:11,057
WIL: It looks like cruise ship goth club.

1245
01:46:11,057 --> 01:46:13,170
MATT: I like that. I'll take that.

1246
01:46:13,170 --> 01:46:15,753
WILL: Cruise ship goth club.

1247
01:46:15,753 --> 01:46:16,921
WIL: That's a thing that exists.

1248
01:46:16,921 --> 01:46:17,950
WILL: Really?!

1249
01:46:17,950 --> 01:46:20,425
MATT: When are we going to this?

1250
01:46:20,425 --> 01:46:25,665
WIL: Every year on the Jonathan Coulton Cruise, we
gather in the cruise ship goth club.

1251
01:46:25,665 --> 01:46:27,265
WILL: Wow.

1252
01:46:27,265 --> 01:46:28,870
MATT: JoCo Cruise.

1253
01:46:28,870 --> 01:46:31,557
WILL: Too many jokes.

1254
01:46:31,557 --> 01:46:40,506
MATT: I know. As you approach the front, you can
see that there are two bouncers established at the

1255
01:46:40,506 --> 01:46:48,714
very front. To the left, you see a meaty male
dragonborn, bronze scale with painted face scars.

1256
01:46:48,714 --> 01:46:53,397
He has a very, very intense look about him. He's
thicker. He's built like a barrel. He sits with

1257
01:46:53,397 --> 01:46:58,513
his arms crossed, looking angrily out amongst the
rest of the folks outside. To the other side, you

1258
01:46:58,513 --> 01:47:05,369
recognize a burly-looking female with short hair
and some facial tattoos. The Siren, who you saw

1259
01:47:05,369 --> 01:47:11,149
battle in the Cauldron, apparently works as one of
the bouncers of the Velvet Cabaret.

1260
01:47:11,149 --> 01:47:22,987
ORION: I approach right next to Vax, as we move
up. Scanlan. In Draconic I go, greetings and

1261
01:47:22,987 --> 01:47:25,204
salutations, friend.

1262
01:47:25,204 --> 01:47:33,362
MATT: He gives you a look of confusion for a
second and leans forward and the dragonborn looks

1263
01:47:33,362 --> 01:47:41,375
very intently at you and says back in Draconic,
"Are you a member?"

1264
01:47:41,375 --> 01:47:50,867
ORION: Not yet. We are new to this place. My
master here is seeking audience with his kind. We

1265
01:47:50,999 --> 01:47:56,224
were guided to this place. This establishment has
a high reputation.

1266
01:47:56,224 --> 01:48:00,841
We wish to inquire how to get inside.

1267
01:48:00,841 --> 01:48:06,790
MATT: Looks over to the Siren. Siren glances back
and, "What's he saying?"

1268
01:48:06,790 --> 01:48:13,250
And the dragonborn glances over. And he says out
loud in Common now, at this point, "He's saying

1269
01:48:13,250 --> 01:48:18,618
"that they're looking to come in here and talk to
other elvish guys, I guess."

1270
01:48:18,618 --> 01:48:24,402
ORION: Oh, not elvish, but more people of high
society. High society here.

1271
01:48:24,402 --> 01:48:27,587
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1272
01:48:34,557 --> 01:48:36,406
ORION: 21.

1273
01:48:36,412 --> 01:48:47,127
MATT: 21. He gives a glance over. "Well, if you're
not a member, you can acquire membership, but it

1274
01:48:47,127 --> 01:48:49,747
"has to approved first by the owner."

1275
01:48:49,747 --> 01:48:56,372
ORION: May we seek audience with him to ask or
apply, or however that goes about.

1276
01:48:56,372 --> 01:49:00,528
MATT: "Let me get his assistant. Hold on just a
second. Siren."

1277
01:49:00,528 --> 01:49:05,140
She gives a look. "I'll be right back." She rolls
up her sleeves

1278
01:49:05,140 --> 01:49:07,672
and steps inside as the door opens.

1279
01:49:07,672 --> 01:49:11,225
MARISHA: As I see her, I turn and face outward.

1280
01:49:11,225 --> 01:49:14,157
WILL: You know her?

1281
01:49:14,157 --> 01:49:15,967
MARISHA: No.

1282
01:49:15,967 --> 01:49:17,168
WILL: Okay.

1283
01:49:17,171 --> 01:49:22,828
MATT: As the door opens, you can already hear 
what sounds like soft harp music coming from the

1284
01:49:22,828 --> 01:49:26,955
interior. And it's hard to actually look inside
because as you can see there are silks draped

1285
01:49:26,955 --> 01:49:30,564
crossed over and in front of the entryway, as soon
as you step in.

1286
01:49:30,564 --> 01:49:36,312
A few moments pass, eventually the Siren returns
and you are greeted at the doorway by a dwarf with

1287
01:49:36,312 --> 01:49:45,850
very well-groomed facial hair. A beard that comes
to a fine point, has a little gold ring at the

1288
01:49:45,850 --> 01:49:54,136
very bottom that kinks it at the bottom, this
little poof. With makeup on. Very rosy cheeks, and

1289
01:49:54,136 --> 01:50:00,265
you can see there is eyeliner around his eyes.
Smile to his face. Wearing these long white robes,

1290
01:50:00,265 --> 01:50:07,433
lots of jewelry. And the rest of his dark brown
hair is pulled into a dual ponytail that runs down

1291
01:50:07,799 --> 01:50:13,792
to the middle of the back. Comes to door and
immediately says, "Gracious welcome to all of you.

1292
01:50:13,792 --> 01:50:17,030
"I've been told that you're seeking possible
membership to our establishment."

1293
01:50:17,030 --> 01:50:20,397
ORION: In Dwarvish I say, that's correct.

1294
01:50:20,397 --> 01:50:28,360
MATT: "Well, fantastic, then. Don't leave possible
patrons outside." And looks off to the two

1295
01:50:28,360 --> 01:50:34,095
bouncers and they grumble and step off to the
side. "Come in. Come in. Follow me." And he steps

1296
01:50:34,095 --> 01:50:40,438
inside. As you guys walk in behind him,
immediately you're hit with the strong smell of

1297
01:50:40,438 --> 01:50:50,348
exotic incense and the cooking of meat mingling
with that. It has this smell of everything good

1298
01:50:50,348 --> 01:50:53,414
you've ever smelled mixed into one location.

1299
01:50:53,414 --> 01:50:57,114
WILL: Love the smell of these places.

1300
01:50:57,114 --> 01:51:03,932
MATT: The interior is fairly low-lit with what
looks like a series of faerie-fire lamps dangling

1301
01:51:03,932 --> 01:51:09,890
in small lattice cages. So it has this light
purplish-pink glow to the general interior. There

1302
01:51:09,890 --> 01:51:14,705
are no stools or chairs. There are tables that low
set and the floor is nearly covered with very,

1303
01:51:14,705 --> 01:51:19,315
very expensive looking pillows. All the patrons
are currently sitting cross-legged or laying

1304
01:51:19,315 --> 01:51:24,247
around the tables. And you can see the clientele
is very well dressed and very wealthy. There is

1305
01:51:24,247 --> 01:51:29,139
laughter and conversation. There's definitely has
a very, very different air. It's like stepping

1306
01:51:29,139 --> 01:51:33,211
into a whole different world from what you're used
to seeing in Vasselheim. And you get the feeling

1307
01:51:33,211 --> 01:51:37,278
that whoever created this establishment definitely
created it to provide a very different experience

1308
01:51:37,278 --> 01:51:40,735
for most people who work here, which means one, it
probably makes a really good killing to the small

1309
01:51:40,735 --> 01:51:44,104
number of clientele, number two, it probably isn't
very well liked by the people who have been living

1310
01:51:44,104 --> 01:51:50,034
here most their life. As you look around, too,
there are dice games being played, there are many

1311
01:51:50,034 --> 01:51:58,342
gold pieces being stacked up on tables. It appears
that there's definitely a lively-- what's the word

1312
01:51:58,342 --> 01:52:07,092
I'm looking for? My brain isn't working-- gambling
arrangement in this place. You notice that all the

1313
01:52:07,092 --> 01:52:15,495
guards in the inside, the bouncers, are common
sell-swords. There's no unification to their

1314
01:52:15,495 --> 01:52:18,639
adornments or any of their armor and stuff. There
are a few folks that are looking around, keeping

1315
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:23,647
the peace, arms crossed. They all definitely have
weapons visible. And they're just sitting there,

1316
01:52:23,647 --> 01:52:26,813
guarding just like the bouncers were at front of
the place.

1317
01:52:26,813 --> 01:52:28,703
WILL: How many dwarves?

1318
01:52:28,703 --> 01:52:30,374
MATT: Just the one that let you inside.

1319
01:52:30,374 --> 01:52:33,548
MARISHA: I reach over and I grab Vax's hand.

1320
01:52:33,548 --> 01:52:39,517
LIAM: I fold her arm in and walk forward.

1321
01:52:39,517 --> 01:52:40,527
MATT: All right.

1322
01:52:40,527 --> 01:52:45,801
WILL: I think, as they move forward, I would like
to pull Thorbir aside and say, maybe since we're

1323
01:52:45,801 --> 01:52:49,165
trying to get membership here, you should cover
your runes.

1324
01:52:53,945 --> 01:52:55,435
WIL: Noted.

1325
01:52:55,435 --> 01:52:57,336
WILL: Thank you.

1326
01:52:57,336 --> 01:53:08,668
WIL: I'd like to make a perception check to size
up the guards around. Ten.

1327
01:53:08,668 --> 01:53:12,558
MATT: Well, that's a step in the right direction.

1328
01:53:12,558 --> 01:53:18,118
WIL: I rolled four times as good as I usually
roll.

1329
01:53:18,118 --> 01:53:24,394
MATT: Looking about, they look armored. It's hard
to tell their skill level, based on the low light

1330
01:53:24,394 --> 01:53:30,065
in here. They seem definitely keeping an eye out,
but you can tell they've been working here a while

1331
01:53:30,065 --> 01:53:34,234
and they've grown comfortable. What you do notice,
though, is a lot of the servers that are walking

1332
01:53:34,234 --> 01:53:42,037
around are young men and women dressed in very
fine silk robes or gowns. All have these iron

1333
01:53:42,037 --> 01:53:47,704
bands around their neck, collars, that aren't
chained to anything. But it immediately gives you

1334
01:53:47,704 --> 01:53:58,785
this mental image of slavery or some sort of
servitude. It does not appear that they are

1335
01:53:58,785 --> 01:54:05,067
actually in some sort of servitude, but the
adornment they wear is almost trying to get across

1336
01:54:05,067 --> 01:54:10,410
that atmosphere, as if that's part of what you're
paying for. It sickens you a little.

1337
01:54:10,410 --> 01:54:18,172
WIL: I'm going to carry myself and I'm going to do
what I can to give off that I'm keeping an eye on

1338
01:54:18,172 --> 01:54:25,418
this guy, that I'm the guy. That's how I'm trying
to carry myself.

1339
01:54:25,418 --> 01:54:29,347
MATT: Okay. As you guys you have walked to the
center of this room now, the dwarf individual who

1340
01:54:29,347 --> 01:54:37,244
let you in turns around and with a bit of a bow.
"I would to introduce myself. My name is Hosin. I

1341
01:54:37,244 --> 01:54:43,598
"am the manager of this fine establishment, the
Velvet Cabaret. I'd like to welcome you..."

1342
01:54:43,598 --> 01:54:46,406
LIAM: Scanlan of the Shorthalts.

1343
01:54:46,406 --> 01:54:49,759
MATT: "Scanlan of the Shorthalts? Where do you
hail from? I've not heard of them."

1344
01:54:49,759 --> 01:54:54,637
LIAM: We come from Emon. I sell shoes. We sell
shoes.

1345
01:54:54,637 --> 01:54:57,104
MARISHA: Yes, Coralin Shorthalt.

1346
01:54:57,104 --> 01:54:58,598
MATT: "Coralin Shorthalt."

1347
01:54:58,598 --> 01:54:59,991
MARISHA: Yes, pleasure.

1348
01:54:59,991 --> 01:55:04,650
MATT: "Very well. Well, you have interest in
membership you say?"

1349
01:55:04,650 --> 01:55:12,263
LIAM: We do. We're hoping to sample the atmosphere
here. Is there entertainment? We heard there was

1350
01:55:12,263 --> 01:55:14,317
great entertainment.

1351
01:55:14,317 --> 01:55:18,019
MATT: "Oh yes, quite entertainment here at certain
hours, if you like. For now, we have more an

1352
01:55:18,019 --> 01:55:21,148
"atmospheric presentation." And he looks over, and
you can you see that there is small stage off to

1353
01:55:21,148 --> 01:55:28,323
the corner. There sits a very beautiful elven
woman, dressed in a gold gown that is sleeveless

1354
01:55:28,323 --> 01:55:32,806
and hugs to her form very well. You can see that
it shimmers and little bit of purple fairy light

1355
01:55:32,806 --> 01:55:36,934
that is hanging above her. And she just this
gorgeous-looking silver harp in front of her.

1356
01:55:36,934 --> 01:55:40,691
She's just plucking away. Her eyes are closed,
like she's just caught in the moment. And there's

1357
01:55:40,691 --> 01:55:45,531
group of people that are sitting around her
chatting softly, not to be overbearing to the

1358
01:55:45,531 --> 01:55:48,258
music, but to just be around that atmosphere.

1359
01:55:48,258 --> 01:55:54,139
ORION: Your wonderful employees mentioned
membership. We'd like to acquire that as well, I

1360
01:55:54,139 --> 01:55:56,717
assume, as well.

1361
01:55:56,717 --> 01:55:59,007
MATT: You're saying this to Hosin?

1362
01:55:59,007 --> 01:56:01,996
LIAM: This is Thorlaxalux, my financial advisor.

1363
01:56:01,996 --> 01:56:06,299
ORION: Thorlaxalux, at your service. I bow
gracefully.

1364
01:56:06,299 --> 01:56:09,229
MATT: Make a persuasion roll. No, deception roll.
Deception roll.

1365
01:56:09,229 --> 01:56:12,795
ORION: What is that? 16?

1366
01:56:12,795 --> 01:56:19,944
MATT: 16? All right. "The pleasure is mine. And
it's not often that come across elves that have

1367
01:56:19,944 --> 01:56:21,745
taken the time to learn the tongue of my folk."

1368
01:56:21,745 --> 01:56:24,228
ORION: I know many languages.

1369
01:56:24,228 --> 01:56:30,530
MARISHA: He's very well traveled. Very well
cultured. That's part why we hired him.

1370
01:56:30,530 --> 01:56:35,474
ORION: I was a bit of a shut-in as a child. All I
had were books on languages to read and whatnot,

1371
01:56:35,474 --> 01:56:37,445
and adventures and what have you.

1372
01:56:37,445 --> 01:56:42,904
MATT: "Well, if you are seeking membership, you
should probably speak with our patron, the owner

1373
01:56:42,904 --> 01:56:49,411
"of this establishment. He's currently in a
meeting, I believe, but step with me for a

1374
01:56:49,411 --> 01:56:52,571
"moment." And he leads you to go to the other side
of the room. And you know, all these draped orange

1375
01:56:52,571 --> 01:56:59,149
and gold silks that are constantly getting in your
way as you push through. Leads you into a doorway

1376
01:56:59,149 --> 01:57:04,702
that is covered in these silks. You push into the
hallway to the right and left. There's a door

1377
01:57:04,702 --> 01:57:07,564
across the way, and two doors down the left. And
the door at the very end is a really

1378
01:57:07,564 --> 01:57:15,009
ornate-looking door with a series of locks that
currently unlocked. Hosin walks up to it and

1379
01:57:15,009 --> 01:57:21,913
knocks gently onto it, takes a listen. "Ah, it
appears that he will be available in just a

1380
01:57:21,913 --> 01:57:25,212
"moment, if you'd like to sit tight, and you're
more than welcome to speak."

1381
01:57:25,212 --> 01:57:35,503
MARISHA: Question, Hosin. While we wait, do you
happen to have any wine or ale? Just while we

1382
01:57:35,503 --> 01:57:37,498
wait. It's been such a long travel.

1383
01:57:37,498 --> 01:57:39,383
MATT: "But of course."

1384
01:57:39,383 --> 01:57:40,780
MARISHA: Thank you. You're so kind.

1385
01:57:40,780 --> 01:57:46,620
MATT: He claps his hands, and you can see one of
the servants that you saw walking with a small

1386
01:57:46,620 --> 01:57:49,792
tray enters from the side of the hallway. "Yes?"

1387
01:57:49,792 --> 01:57:56,933
Hosin turns. "The finest wine we have available 
for the elven lass right here." The servant

1388
01:57:56,933 --> 01:58:04,292
immediately darts off, averting the eyes. A moment
passes. Returns with three glasses of wine,

1389
01:58:04,292 --> 01:58:09,655
looking over you two. Hands one to each of you.
And the servant, still averting his gaze from the

1390
01:58:09,655 --> 01:58:14,002
guests, smiles, gives a little curtsy, and then
darts back into the main room.

1391
01:58:14,002 --> 01:58:17,459
MARISHA: Cheers. Cling.

1392
01:58:17,459 --> 01:58:21,704
LIAM: I cling and hand my glass to Thorbir.

1393
01:58:27,344 --> 01:58:30,680
MARISHA: I take a sip of mine. It's very good.

1394
01:58:30,680 --> 01:58:35,546
WIL: All right. I'm sipping to keep up the charade, 
but I'm not happy about it.

1395
01:58:40,036 --> 01:58:44,704
MATT: It's definitely an elvish blend, which is
generally too sweet for your tastes, but for what

1396
01:58:44,704 --> 01:58:48,919
you were expecting, it's not too bad. Its
serviceable. Nowhere near strong enough to really

1397
01:58:48,919 --> 01:58:51,931
do anything, but it's not water.

1398
01:58:51,931 --> 01:58:57,345
WIL: So as I hand it back to you, I sort of
mutter, wine.

1399
01:58:57,345 --> 01:59:03,505
(laughter)

1400
01:59:03,505 --> 01:59:07,185
WIL: Giant dwarven air quotes.

1401
01:59:07,185 --> 01:59:13,583
MATT: The doorway at the end of the hallway opens
up suddenly, and as it does, a servant walks out

1402
01:59:13,583 --> 01:59:19,354
holding a tray that contains a bunch of
partially-eaten fruits and what looks the outer

1403
01:59:19,354 --> 01:59:27,838
gristle of some sort of cooked meat, and looks at
you all awkwardly and steps past and disappears

1404
01:59:27,838 --> 01:59:35,665
into the other room. You hear a voice come down
the hallway. "Enter! I ask you all to enter. You

1405
01:59:35,665 --> 01:59:43,364
"are to meet me. Please, come, sit, be comfortable.
Welcome to the Velvet Cabaret."

1406
01:59:43,364 --> 01:59:46,942
LIAM: Look to Thorbir and then look in the room.

1407
01:59:50,732 --> 01:59:52,787
WIL: I step into the room.

1408
01:59:52,787 --> 02:00:00,039
MATT: As you enter, Hosin lowers his head and
offers his arms at the rest of you to acquiesce.

1409
02:00:00,039 --> 02:00:08,074
Stepping into the room, you see-- once again, a
room that has a square or rectangular table in the

1410
02:00:08,074 --> 02:00:14,577
center that has a series of small platters on it
with bits of previously devoured meal, and there

1411
02:00:14,577 --> 02:00:21,321
are three small cushions on the ground that you
see would act as some sort of sitting arrangement.

1412
02:00:21,321 --> 02:00:26,887
The opposite side of the room has three large
purple cushions on which there are two women, also

1413
02:00:26,887 --> 02:00:31,021
servants, that are just lying back comfortably,
just resting, and in the center, you see a man,

1414
02:00:31,021 --> 02:00:40,126
very dark complexion, ratty looking, crimped dark
hair, very well-trimmed beard and mustache

1415
02:00:40,126 --> 02:00:49,077
ensemble, and long black and gold robes. Very,
very long sleeves and jewelry adorning every ounce

1416
02:00:49,077 --> 02:00:52,934
of his hands, his fingers, you can barely see the
actual skin beneath, there is just so much jewelry

1417
02:00:52,934 --> 02:00:58,650
adorning him. He looks up smiling with his elbows
near the edge of the table. "Have a seat. We are

1418
02:00:58,650 --> 02:01:04,261
"to talk, yes? Introduce yourselves. Guests are
always welcome, but I wish to know who it is that

1419
02:01:04,261 --> 02:01:05,952
"I am guesting for."

1420
02:01:05,952 --> 02:01:16,484
LIAM: I seat Coralin and have a seat myself. And
pretending to check out the women in the room, I

1421
02:01:16,484 --> 02:01:21,627
make a perception check. And that is a 16.

1422
02:01:21,627 --> 02:01:26,080
MATT: All right, what are trying to see?

1423
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:31,031
LIAM: Oh, if anything sets off my alarm
bells.

1424
02:01:31,031 --> 02:01:36,010
MATT: They seem to be lounging. And there isn't
like fear in their eyes or that they are being

1425
02:01:36,010 --> 02:01:39,532
mistreated per se. Almost like they're here for
atmosphere.

1426
02:01:39,532 --> 02:01:40,758
LIAM: And the room itself?

1427
02:01:40,758 --> 02:01:46,542
MATT: The room itself-- Most of the walls have
like a velvety texture to them. All the wood has

1428
02:01:46,542 --> 02:01:53,507
been covered with some sort of material that has a
comfortable almost-- Everything feels like it's a

1429
02:01:53,507 --> 02:01:59,774
lounging bedroom. And that's the aesthetic of a
lot of the interior of this location. You cannot

1430
02:01:59,774 --> 02:02:04,681
quite see the source of the light in the room. It
almost feels like there's an indirect lighting

1431
02:02:04,681 --> 02:02:08,846
accoutrement across the ceiling. Whatever the
source of lighting is, it's being spread across

1432
02:02:08,846 --> 02:02:17,421
the top. It gives this sort of dark intimate feel
to this current room at least. As he gestures out

1433
02:02:17,421 --> 02:02:22,846
to the rest of you to sit. "I fear there are only
three seats, but I assume that your accompaniment

1434
02:02:22,846 --> 02:02:31,738
"are accustomed to standing, anyway. So do not
worry. Very good. Now you say you come for

1435
02:02:31,738 --> 02:02:36,420
"membership. Membership does not come cheap.
Membership does not come to anyone. We have

1436
02:02:36,420 --> 02:02:40,519
"a certain level of clientele we wish to keep, because
in keeping this it is easy enough for us to

1437
02:02:40,519 --> 02:02:46,282
"consider it very-- how do I say?-- exquisite."

1438
02:02:46,282 --> 02:02:50,993
MARISHA: I'm sorry, before we go on, what was your
name? I don't believe I caught it.

1439
02:02:50,993 --> 02:02:53,277
MATT: "I did not catch your name either."

1440
02:02:53,277 --> 02:02:56,129
MARISHA: Oh, I'm sorry, I am Coralin. Coralin
Shorthalt.

1441
02:02:56,129 --> 02:02:57,092
MATT: "Coralin Shorthalt."

1442
02:02:57,092 --> 02:02:58,803
MARISHA: Of the Emon Shorthalts.

1443
02:02:58,948 --> 02:03:02,805
MATT: Takes your hand and leans forward, and gives
you this ginger kiss to edge of your fingers.

1444
02:03:02,805 --> 02:03:13,566
Yeah, there is a slimy-ish presence, but not too
aggressive. Just a very well-trained type of

1445
02:03:13,566 --> 02:03:15,290
dealing with guests.

1446
02:03:15,290 --> 02:03:19,532
MARISHA: I subversively wipe it on my robes.

1447
02:03:19,532 --> 02:03:26,909
MATT: "My name is Vince Cyinnor. And I am the
owner of this house of joy and pleasure."

1448
02:03:26,909 --> 02:03:36,030
LIAM: I'm the lucky man who married her. My name
is Scanlan of the Shorthalts. We're in from Emon,

1449
02:03:36,030 --> 02:03:46,007
and reputation of this establishment is well known
within all parts of the walls. We're looking to

1450
02:03:46,007 --> 02:03:50,732
possibly become members here. We hear the
entertainment is top-notch, and we hear that

1451
02:03:50,732 --> 02:04:04,009
business happens within these walls. But I'm not
convinced. I'm hoping to stay for an hour to see

1452
02:04:04,009 --> 02:04:11,680
what you have to offer. When I find I like a
place, I stay for a long time and leave a lot of

1453
02:04:11,680 --> 02:04:16,053
money. I'd just like a little taste.

1454
02:04:16,053 --> 02:04:19,496
MATT: Make a deception check.

1455
02:04:19,638 --> 02:04:30,536
LIAM: Using my last Luck of the day. That's
better. 15.

1456
02:04:30,536 --> 02:04:44,343
MATT: 15. "Hosin, if you don't mind." And the door
closes behind you guys. "Well, Scanlan Shorthalt.

1457
02:04:44,343 --> 02:04:54,966
"What, may I ask, business do you run that gives
you the liquid assets to think that you can walk

1458
02:04:54,966 --> 02:05:01,028
"and rub shoulders among such astute clientele? You
are well-dressed, I see, and well-versed in

1459
02:05:01,028 --> 02:05:10,445
"conversation. But have not heard of you before and
I have very acute ears for people of such heritage

1460
02:05:10,445 --> 02:05:11,841
"in this city."

1461
02:05:11,841 --> 02:05:20,924
LIAM: We hail from Emon. We're not very flashy. We
certainly don't do much in public in Emon. I

1462
02:05:20,924 --> 02:05:25,419
prefer to make my money and enjoy my money and I
don't believe in ostentation.

1463
02:05:25,419 --> 02:05:35,693
MATT: "Why have you come to this establishment? I
am made of ostentation, for I do not fear what

1464
02:05:35,693 --> 02:05:39,725
"people judge or think here. Do what you like."

1465
02:05:39,725 --> 02:05:45,551
LIAM: Don't get me wrong. I enjoy the form of a
beautiful woman as much as the next man.

1466
02:05:45,551 --> 02:05:49,830
MATT: "Why limit yourself?"

1467
02:05:49,830 --> 02:05:52,925
LIAM: Who said I do?

1468
02:05:52,925 --> 02:05:57,246
MATT: "Even this one here, while his appearance
may be rough, I'm certain that under certain

1469
02:05:57,246 --> 02:06:04,615
"circumstances he could be persuaded to prove his
weight in more than gold and weaponry."

1470
02:06:04,615 --> 02:06:10,489
MARISHA: Mr. Cyinnor, I think it is best that you
do not make presumptions

1471
02:06:10,489 --> 02:06:14,165
on our relationship and dealings.

1472
02:06:14,165 --> 02:06:24,444
LIAM: My wife and I are businessmen. And what we
hear is that this is where business happens.

1473
02:06:24,444 --> 02:06:30,349
MATT: "Business does happen here, yes. Quite a bit
of interesting business."

1474
02:06:30,349 --> 02:06:35,575
MARISHA: And we are very interested in all of
those interesting businesses.

1475
02:06:35,575 --> 02:06:43,569
MATT: "From what I hear, as my assistant has told me,
your business is shoes. Tell me, why would the

1476
02:06:43,569 --> 02:06:50,127
"business of shoes require such an ostentatious
location for business?"

1477
02:06:50,127 --> 02:06:56,182
LIAM: The shoes are the public face, but the well
runs deep.

1478
02:06:56,182 --> 02:07:05,399
MATT: "We get to the meat of the matter, eh? So,
shoes is but an appearance. What is your business

1479
02:07:05,399 --> 02:07:08,568
"aside from cobbling, Mr. Shorthalt?"

1480
02:07:08,568 --> 02:07:23,355
LIAM: I know my way around poison, and I hear you
have the rarest of breeds here. I have come to

1481
02:07:23,355 --> 02:07:28,670
spend some money to satisfy my clients.

1482
02:07:28,670 --> 02:07:34,755
MATT: Make a deception check.

1483
02:07:34,755 --> 02:07:36,086
LIAM: 15 again.

1484
02:07:36,086 --> 02:07:37,209
MATT: What was it?

1485
02:07:37,209 --> 02:07:38,773
LIAM: 15 again.

1486
02:07:38,773 --> 02:07:51,937
MATT: "Poisons? So you supply to what?
King-killers? Supply to sell-swords? You apply

1487
02:07:51,937 --> 02:08:00,009
"them to your own weapons? You realize this city is
very, very tight-knit when it comes to these sorts of

1488
02:08:00,009 --> 02:08:04,685
"industries. Although I know you would think possibly
to find it here, I guarantee you what we deal with

1489
02:08:04,864 --> 02:08:07,752
"here has nothing to do with slitting of throats."

1490
02:08:07,752 --> 02:08:14,844
LIAM: I'm not looking to sell. I'm looking to
buy.

1491
02:08:14,844 --> 02:08:25,015
MATT: "I will tell you one thing that I am interested
in buying. I'm interested in buying information.

1492
02:08:25,015 --> 02:08:33,561
"I'm interested in buying loyalty. I'm interested
in buying trust. Since you've walked into this

1493
02:08:33,561 --> 02:08:39,575
"room, there has been an air of something not right
about you. And through this conversation, I have

1494
02:08:39,575 --> 02:08:46,645
"come to believe that perhaps you're not telling me
the truth. Now, I will ask of you this moment,

1495
02:08:46,645 --> 02:08:54,925
"whoever you may be, Shorthalt or not, but this
entire facility is very well paid to make sure

1496
02:08:54,925 --> 02:09:00,918
"that should you try anything funny, you won't get
but two steps before the heads leave your

1497
02:09:00,918 --> 02:09:07,535
"shoulders. So let's be frank here. Who are you?
Why are you here?"

1498
02:09:07,535 --> 02:09:17,537
MARISHA: Mr. Vince, let's not play coy. I am sure
you have dealt with many a powerful client in

1499
02:09:17,537 --> 02:09:22,795
your day. And I am sure that it is not unfamiliar
to you that many powerful clients

1500
02:09:22,795 --> 02:09:27,974
have many deep secrets.

1501
02:09:27,974 --> 02:09:30,927
ORION: As she finishes that, I dispel Alter Self.

1502
02:09:30,927 --> 02:09:37,774
MATT: Okay. As your actual dragonborn appearance
restores itself, he sits back.

1503
02:09:37,774 --> 02:09:44,724
ORION: My apologies. I am Tiberius Stormwind--
yes, wind.

1504
02:09:44,724 --> 02:09:46,535
WILL: I can never get it right.

1505
02:09:46,535 --> 02:09:54,872
ORION: I merely dispelled this to show you that
earning your trust is in our best interests. I do

1506
02:09:54,872 --> 02:09:56,600
not wish to deceive.

1507
02:09:56,600 --> 02:10:00,039
MATT: "Then perhaps you should have walked in this
form when you first arrived."

1508
02:10:00,039 --> 02:10:04,550
ORION: Many people don't take kindly to a red
dragonborn by the way. I just thought it was best.

1509
02:10:04,550 --> 02:10:10,984
We're in a new town and it was standard protocol
whenever we visit a new town. My apologies.

1510
02:10:10,984 --> 02:10:17,477
MATT: "Well, one person has come clean. What about
this one? What is your business here?"

1511
02:10:17,477 --> 02:10:23,024
WILL: My business here is the same as theirs.
We're here, in the long run, to help you.

1512
02:10:23,024 --> 02:10:26,619
MATT: "What is to help me? You have not told me
what your business is."

1513
02:10:26,619 --> 02:10:32,947
LIAM: We're here to stop a murderer.

1514
02:10:32,947 --> 02:10:35,187
MATT: "Explain."

1515
02:10:35,187 --> 02:10:44,786
LIAM: Bodies have been showing up outside this
building. Multiple bodies. We're not going to get

1516
02:10:44,786 --> 02:10:49,407
into the details, but we've been sent here to stop
that from happening any further.

1517
02:10:49,407 --> 02:10:51,922
ORION: We're fairly sure you know of this.

1518
02:10:51,922 --> 02:10:55,143
LIAM: Look at this guy. Does he look like he's
fucking around?

1519
02:10:55,143 --> 02:11:00,656
WIL: He winks at him.

1520
02:11:00,656 --> 02:11:06,470
MATT: The force of the wink itself is intense
enough to the point where he physically shudders

1521
02:11:06,470 --> 02:11:09,170
and leans back a few inches.

1522
02:11:09,170 --> 02:11:16,375
LIAM: Now, you must be aware of this problem.
Can't be a surprise to you. People are starting to

1523
02:11:16,375 --> 02:11:21,589
take notice in this city. This was inevitable.

1524
02:11:21,589 --> 02:11:25,623
WILL: Do you still have Lord Tyrell's
possessions?

1525
02:11:25,623 --> 02:11:33,736
MATT: "This is about Lord Tyrell? We do have his
possessions. They have been investigated. Our

1526
02:11:33,736 --> 02:11:38,571
"establishment has already been investigated. The
Bastions were very thorough, and we have been

1527
02:11:38,571 --> 02:11:41,299
"found absolved of any sort of involvement."

1528
02:11:41,299 --> 02:11:47,699
MARISHA: We are not Bastions. And we are not here
to accuse. And we are not here to investigate your

1529
02:11:47,699 --> 02:11:49,146
establishment.

1530
02:11:49,146 --> 02:11:55,334
MATT: "Interesting. You come in here and lie. It
seems to me exactly what you're doing. Now, are

1531
02:11:55,334 --> 02:11:58,499
"you coming to ask questions? To see what
involvement we have? Answers? We've already told

1532
02:11:58,499 --> 02:12:01,133
"everything to anyone else. We have no involvement.
I don't know what you're talking about. This is

1533
02:12:01,133 --> 02:12:03,511
"ridiculous. And I may have to ask you to leave."

1534
02:12:03,511 --> 02:12:05,490
MARISHA: He's shutting down. Someone do something
quick.

1535
02:12:05,490 --> 02:12:08,421
LIAM: Insight check, insight check. Balls.

1536
02:12:08,421 --> 02:12:11,645
WIL: I will also make an insight check.

1537
02:12:11,645 --> 02:12:13,880
MARISHA: Can I do that, as well?

1538
02:12:13,880 --> 02:12:16,221
(laughter)

1539
02:12:16,221 --> 02:12:22,464
MATT: What did you get?

1540
02:12:22,464 --> 02:12:25,118
MARISHA: We're all going to die.

1541
02:12:25,118 --> 02:12:27,648
LIAM: That makes my ten look titanic.

1542
02:12:27,648 --> 02:12:31,784
WIL: I'm trying to make you look good. It's what
Thorbir does.

1543
02:12:31,784 --> 02:12:34,040
MARISHA: 19.

1544
02:12:34,040 --> 02:12:35,919
WIL: I rolled a two.

1545
02:12:35,919 --> 02:12:37,832
WILL: You're going up.

1546
02:12:37,832 --> 02:12:43,151
MATT: It's not impressive. That's mythic.

1547
02:12:43,151 --> 02:12:45,605
WIL: Statistically unlikely.

1548
02:12:45,605 --> 02:12:47,968
WILL: That's the thing. You're beating math.

1549
02:12:47,968 --> 02:12:54,133
WIL: I've been beating math for 20 years. I'm very
good.

1550
02:12:54,133 --> 02:12:57,652
MATT: Yeah. You're the singularity that ruins the
universe.

1551
02:12:57,652 --> 02:13:03,002
WIL: Somewhere in the world there's a person who
never rolls under 17. And I was placed on this

1552
02:13:03,002 --> 02:13:12,141
planet to balance the math to save you all. To
prevent the center of the planet from collapsing

1553
02:13:12,141 --> 02:13:15,099
and taking us all with it. You're welcome.

1554
02:13:15,099 --> 02:13:18,809
LIAM: She's in New Zealand. The other side of the
Earth.

1555
02:13:18,809 --> 02:13:24,324
MATT: All right. So, as you're all taking this
moment to yourself. It's hard to read. It seems

1556
02:13:24,324 --> 02:13:29,560
like he's very thorough and offended by this
circumstance. You glean that there is a

1557
02:13:29,560 --> 02:13:37,287
nervousness, and there are droplets of sweat
across his brow. And his brusqeness does show a

1558
02:13:37,287 --> 02:13:38,918
bit of fear in his eyes.

1559
02:13:38,918 --> 02:13:46,650
MARISHA: About this time, I go (fwoosh) and I cast my
wind spell. And I slam the doors behind us. And I

1560
02:13:46,854 --> 02:13:52,430
slam the shutters. And turn out all the lights.
Did you say there was candlelight? Or did you say

1561
02:13:52,430 --> 02:13:54,065
there was weird indirect lighting.

1562
02:13:54,065 --> 02:13:57,131
MATT: Yeah, indirect lighting. You don't quite
know where the source is coming from. The door was

1563
02:13:57,131 --> 02:14:03,734
already closed behind you. Hosin closed it. But as
the wind comes out, all the silks blow against the

1564
02:14:03,734 --> 02:14:10,222
wall. Pillows are lobbed to the sides. Both of the
women in there (yelps) and pull back against walls,

1565
02:14:10,340 --> 02:14:15,343
trying to keep out of the circumstance. And you
can see Vince has begun to stand up and his hair

1566
02:14:15,343 --> 02:14:17,849
blown back. "What is the meaning of this?"

1567
02:14:17,849 --> 02:14:25,356
MARISHA: Now. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.
I sometimes get a little out of control. But

1568
02:14:25,356 --> 02:14:28,630
remain calm! All right?! Jesus! Remain calm!

1569
02:14:28,630 --> 02:14:30,005
ORION: You calm down.

1570
02:14:30,005 --> 02:14:32,308
MARISHA: I'm sorry! I'm trying to remain calm,
too!

1571
02:14:32,308 --> 02:14:33,919
WILL: Doing a great job.

1572
02:14:33,919 --> 02:14:37,442
MARISHA: Thank you! Okay.

1573
02:14:37,442 --> 02:14:39,262
MATT: Persuasion check.

1574
02:14:39,262 --> 02:14:40,607
MARISHA: Damn it.

1575
02:14:40,607 --> 02:14:43,188
LIAM: Who's in this room? It's the women--

1576
02:14:43,188 --> 02:14:51,244
MATT: It's the women and Vince. Hosin closed the
door and left in the hallway.

1577
02:14:51,244 --> 02:14:52,928
LIAM: Vince is the--

1578
02:14:52,928 --> 02:14:53,940
MATT: Owner.

1579
02:14:53,940 --> 02:14:55,020
LIAM: But is he human?

1580
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:56,135
MATT: He's human.

1581
02:14:56,135 --> 02:14:59,258
ORION: I'm going to approach him and I'm going to
cast Mage Hand. I'm going to have it float right up

1582
02:14:59,258 --> 02:15:05,101
in front of me. I'm like, now, you better start
cooperating, because it seems to me that you're

1583
02:15:05,101 --> 02:15:10,269
getting very nervous. And we don't want to do
anything. Nor do we want to leave. All we want is

1584
02:15:10,269 --> 02:15:17,093
information. I guess we want to know what you want
to know, too. We want a lot of information. So

1585
02:15:17,093 --> 02:15:19,835
start talking and stop acting like a fool.

1586
02:15:19,835 --> 02:15:21,966
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

1587
02:15:21,966 --> 02:15:27,110
LIAM: He's sometimes hard to follow, but you don't
want to fuck with him.

1588
02:15:27,110 --> 02:15:28,441
ORION: 15.

1589
02:15:28,441 --> 02:15:33,095
MATT: 15? As you do this, between you standing,
he's in the process of standing up, and he was

1590
02:15:33,095 --> 02:15:39,068
reaching for something under one of the cushions.
As you do that, he glances about the room, looks

1591
02:15:39,068 --> 02:15:42,963
over to you specifically, and back to the
dragonborn, the dwarf.

1592
02:15:42,963 --> 02:15:46,778
MARISHA: And I say, and whatever weapon you were
about to brandish,

1593
02:15:46,778 --> 02:15:50,388
you'd best wise to leave it be.

1594
02:15:50,388 --> 02:15:57,579
MATT: "You realize, you may have just alerted
pretty much the entirety of my guard to this

1595
02:15:57,579 --> 02:16:00,265
"establishment. They'll be descending on this room
soon."

1596
02:16:00,265 --> 02:16:03,448
MARISHA: And you realize that this is only because
of your doing?

1597
02:16:03,448 --> 02:16:06,413
MATT: He sits down on the cushion again.

1598
02:16:06,413 --> 02:16:14,984
WIL: And Thorbir looks at him and goes, okay. And
pulls his greataxe out and leans on his greataxe.

1599
02:16:14,984 --> 02:16:17,714
ORION: I disperse the magic hand.

1600
02:16:17,714 --> 02:16:27,861
MARISHA: I say, now. Our quarrel is not with you.
We are not with the guard.

1601
02:16:27,861 --> 02:16:29,757
We are not with the Bastions.

1602
02:16:29,757 --> 02:16:31,508
ORION: More calm.

1603
02:16:31,508 --> 02:16:33,611
WILL: Yes, still doing a great job with the calm,
there.

1604
02:16:33,611 --> 02:16:42,464
MARISHA: I'm trying. I'm sorry. I get emotional.
I'm trying to remain calm, here. Okay?

1605
02:16:42,464 --> 02:16:44,367
MATT: "What do you wish to know?"

1606
02:16:44,367 --> 02:16:48,279
WILL: Once again, do you still have Lord Tyrell's
possessions?

1607
02:16:48,279 --> 02:16:53,074
MATT: "His possessions are not under my keeping,
no."

1608
02:16:53,074 --> 02:16:56,574
ORION: There we go. Thank you. Where are they?

1609
02:16:56,574 --> 02:16:58,715
MATT: "I have no idea."

1610
02:16:58,715 --> 02:17:00,235
WILL: I want to do a perception check.

1611
02:17:00,235 --> 02:17:01,283
MATT: This would be insight, yeah.

1612
02:17:01,283 --> 02:17:06,541
WILL: Insight check. Nice, where are we? Ooh, wow.
26.

1613
02:17:06,541 --> 02:17:07,779
MATT: 26.

1614
02:17:07,779 --> 02:17:09,229
WIL: What's that like?

1615
02:17:09,229 --> 02:17:13,844
WILL: That's 29 of your rolls, strangely enough.

1616
02:17:13,844 --> 02:17:20,616
(laughter)

1617
02:17:20,616 --> 02:17:27,222
MATT: Looking at you tense. He's fumbling lie
after lie right now.

1618
02:17:27,381 --> 02:17:30,266
WILL: It's just, you could easily tell.

1619
02:17:30,266 --> 02:17:35,316
MATT: Yeah. For you especially, all the signs are
there, the quivering to his voice, his eyes

1620
02:17:35,316 --> 02:17:38,391
darting from person to person. He's still
covering.

1621
02:17:38,391 --> 02:17:43,401
WILL: Okay, you're sitting in a room now with a
whole bunch of people that want to hurt you. So

1622
02:17:43,401 --> 02:17:49,183
it's obvious that you're lying. What do you know,
or this guy and this guy

1623
02:17:49,183 --> 02:17:51,398
are going to dragon and axe you.

1624
02:17:51,398 --> 02:18:02,493
MATT: "Look, what happened was unfortunate. There
are things beyond your understanding or control

1625
02:18:02,493 --> 02:18:04,244
"involved here."

1626
02:18:04,244 --> 02:18:06,884
WIL: Oh, I don't know, we can understand a lot.

1627
02:18:06,884 --> 02:18:11,813
ORION: We fought a beholder before.

1628
02:18:11,813 --> 02:18:17,197
MARISHA: Do not take us for fools who just walked
in here without a clue.

1629
02:18:17,197 --> 02:18:23,083
LIAM: I walk forward, I pull out Dagger of Venom
and I drop a little bead of black down the blade

1630
02:18:23,083 --> 02:18:32,247
and I hold it just about a centimeter under his
neck. I've all run out of patience, friend. We're

1631
02:18:32,247 --> 02:18:38,219
here to help this city and you're going to help
us. Talk.

1632
02:18:38,219 --> 02:18:41,521
MATT: Make an intimidation check with advantage
because of this whole setup here.

1633
02:18:41,521 --> 02:18:45,046
MARISHA: Dear god, so many. Come on.

1634
02:18:45,046 --> 02:18:47,771
LIAM: 20.

1635
02:18:47,771 --> 02:18:52,580
MATT: "They'll kill me if I say anything."

1636
02:18:52,580 --> 02:18:54,948
WILL: We're going to kill you now.

1637
02:18:54,948 --> 02:18:56,666
LIAM: Now or later, friend.

1638
02:18:56,666 --> 02:18:59,365
ORION: And we could protect you from them. Or it.

1639
02:18:59,365 --> 02:19:09,003
MATT: "This establishment. I am not the owner. I
am a figurehead. Something else currently pulls

1640
02:19:09,003 --> 02:19:10,910
"the strings from behind."

1641
02:19:10,910 --> 02:19:12,772
MARISHA: Something else?

1642
02:19:12,772 --> 02:19:14,461
ORION: As we said, it.

1643
02:19:14,461 --> 02:19:21,137
MATT: And he looks off, past you, just over your
shoulder.

1644
02:19:21,137 --> 02:19:22,503
LIAM: Perception check.

1645
02:19:22,503 --> 02:19:24,180
MARISHA: Oh, son of a bitch.

1646
02:19:24,180 --> 02:19:27,571
LIAM: 23.

1647
02:19:27,571 --> 02:19:32,382
MATT: You glance over your shoulder briefly and at
this point you can see the door is partially ajar,

1648
02:19:32,382 --> 02:19:38,385
and you can see in what little light there is a
dwarven face staring through the passage that then

1649
02:19:38,385 --> 02:19:41,377
slams the door shut quickly and you hear
footsteps.

1650
02:19:41,377 --> 02:19:43,089
MARISHA and WILL: Was that Hosin?

1651
02:19:43,089 --> 02:19:44,618
MATT: That was Hosin, yeah.

1652
02:19:44,618 --> 02:19:46,333
MARISHA: Fucking Hosin.

1653
02:19:46,333 --> 02:19:48,357
WILL: Thanks a lot, hoser!

1654
02:19:48,357 --> 02:19:55,605
MATT: He's shaking his head now, the blade there,
as you hear the feet running off now.

1655
02:19:55,605 --> 02:20:03,806
MARISHA: I'm going-- something tiny and fast.
What's tiny and fast?

1656
02:20:03,806 --> 02:20:06,183
LIAM: Mouse, rat.

1657
02:20:06,183 --> 02:20:11,407
MARISHA: I'm going rat, and I'm going after
Hosin.

1658
02:20:11,407 --> 02:20:18,149
MATT: All right. You guys watch as Keyleth all of
a sudden grasps the side of her armor and then her

1659
02:20:18,149 --> 02:20:21,364
form shrinks down to a tiny rat, then darts
underneath.

1660
02:20:21,364 --> 02:20:25,649
LIAM: I'm going to bap this guy in the head. I'm
going to just flip the blade and strike him across

1661
02:20:25,649 --> 02:20:27,386
the forehead.

1662
02:20:27,386 --> 02:20:32,612
ORION: As I see her do this, I open the scroll of
Polymorph. I do Polymorph on myself, and I turn

1663
02:20:32,612 --> 02:20:35,580
myself into a gadfly. And follow.

1664
02:20:35,580 --> 02:20:40,349
MATT: Okay. The scroll is consumed and gone. You
turn into a fly and follow, as well. Two of your

1665
02:20:40,349 --> 02:20:42,935
party members just shrunk and vanished and went
off as creatures.

1666
02:20:42,935 --> 02:20:44,915
You, go ahead and roll for an attack.

1667
02:20:44,915 --> 02:20:49,843
LIAM: Okay, so on a surprise, it's advantage. So
19's pretty good. I'll take the 19

1668
02:20:49,843 --> 02:20:54,787
over the two. So that's 19 plus-- 30.

1669
02:20:54,909 --> 02:20:58,045
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll sneak attack
damage on that.

1670
02:20:58,045 --> 02:21:03,164
LIAM: Okay, sneak attack damage. Is this a
surprise because he didn't know it was coming?

1671
02:21:03,164 --> 02:21:04,469
MATT: Yes, it is.

1672
02:21:04,469 --> 02:21:11,265
LIAM: It is? So because of my assassinate feat,
then this is a critical hit. So just the sneak

1673
02:21:11,265 --> 02:21:20,912
attack damage? Okay, four, eight, ten, 12, 15, 21,
42.

1674
02:21:20,912 --> 02:21:25,748
MATT: With 42? Yeah, you (whack). He's out like a
light. Lights off, face on a pillow. The two

1675
02:21:25,748 --> 02:21:31,422
women squeal in reaction. You guys, as you
rush under the door, what are you guys doing?

1676
02:21:31,433 --> 02:21:35,449
WIL: I've been leaning over to see what he was
reaching for.

1677
02:21:35,449 --> 02:21:42,586
MATT: As you glance over you can see what appears
to be a small jeweled blade that is hidden

1678
02:21:42,586 --> 02:21:46,650
underneath one of the cushions there. It's a
curved dagger that comes to a gradual point.

1679
02:21:46,650 --> 02:21:48,824
WIL: I'm going to take that.

1680
02:21:48,824 --> 02:21:52,038
MATT: Okay. So mark down jeweled dagger in your
equipment.

1681
02:21:52,038 --> 02:21:54,832
WILL: I want to search him. I want to see if he
has anything on him, in his pockets, anything.

1682
02:21:54,832 --> 02:22:02,025
MATT: Okay. As you are beginning to go through his
body, you guys have rushed beneath, and as you can

1683
02:22:02,025 --> 02:22:09,387
see, the dwarf, Hosin, is walking down the hallway
really quickly with his robes open.

1684
02:22:09,387 --> 02:22:12,635
ORION: As a gadfly, can I really quickly buzz in
front of him?

1685
02:22:12,635 --> 02:22:15,259
MATT: You pull underneath, because you had to go
underneath the door to make it into the hallway.

1686
02:22:15,259 --> 02:22:21,255
You see him, he's about 15 feet away, and as he's
walking, he's looking about very nervously. He's

1687
02:22:21,255 --> 02:22:27,314
seen one of the guards is approaching, and he
looks back over and sees the rat scurrying down

1688
02:22:27,314 --> 02:22:28,361
the hallway.

1689
02:22:28,361 --> 02:22:29,642
ORION: How far away is he from me?

1690
02:22:29,642 --> 02:22:30,849
MATT: He's about 20 feet.

1691
02:22:30,849 --> 02:22:33,531
ORION: How far away is the guard in front of him?

1692
02:22:33,531 --> 02:22:38,386
MATT: You know what, let me go ahead and pull this
up. It'll give a good indicator of the

1693
02:22:38,386 --> 02:22:39,852
circumstance here.

1694
02:22:39,852 --> 02:22:42,186
MARISHA: He does what?

1695
02:22:42,186 --> 02:22:47,735
ORION: Oh god, we have a map.

1696
02:22:47,735 --> 02:22:50,276
LIAM: Gentlemen, we need to move.

1697
02:22:50,276 --> 02:22:52,772
ORION: Okay, so he's right there.

1698
02:22:52,772 --> 02:22:55,952
LIAM: Mama Cass, what have you found?

1699
02:22:55,952 --> 02:23:03,546
MATT: All right, you guys are currently inspecting
him at the moment,

1700
02:23:03,546 --> 02:23:04,890
as you guys are rushing through.

1701
02:23:04,890 --> 02:23:07,318
ORION: Oh! So I'm within 20 feet of him,
whatever?

1702
02:23:07,318 --> 02:23:13,025
MATT: Actually no, he'd be back here. He's just
rushing past. So he's 20 to 25 feet from you.

1703
02:23:13,025 --> 02:23:23,305
ORION: Okay. Ah. I'm going to dispel Polymorph,
and I'm going to cast Silence in front of him. I'm

1704
02:23:23,305 --> 02:23:24,744
going to silence him.

1705
02:23:24,744 --> 02:23:30,823
MATT: Okay. All right, so you're using him as the
source?

1706
02:23:30,823 --> 02:23:32,085
ORION: Yes.

1707
02:23:32,085 --> 02:23:39,503
MATT: Okay. So as you un-Polymorph, he looks over
his shoulder and sees you take this form, you go

1708
02:23:39,503 --> 02:23:47,514
ahead and cast Silence, which has an opposition.
What level spell is that? 2nd-level?

1709
02:23:47,514 --> 02:23:51,153
ORION: Yes. I believe so.

1710
02:23:51,153 --> 02:24:02,952
MATT: Okay, cool. So that creates a sphere of a
20-foot radius of silence here. So he goes and he

1711
02:24:02,952 --> 02:24:09,085
does like a hand motion. Nothing happens.
Frustrated, he continues to run. I'm going to have

1712
02:24:09,085 --> 02:24:11,503
you guys roll initiative.

1713
02:24:11,503 --> 02:24:17,984
MARISHA: Fucking shit. 17.

1714
02:24:17,984 --> 02:24:19,479
MATT: 17?

1715
02:24:19,479 --> 02:24:24,781
ORION: Sorry. What is that? 17.

1716
02:24:24,781 --> 02:24:34,171
MATT: 17 and 17. All right. So you guys will both
be going first, but before we finish that, as you

1717
02:24:34,171 --> 02:24:39,146
guys are searching the body you hear all of a
sudden the sound of some sort of scuffle, a flash

1718
02:24:39,146 --> 02:24:44,168
of some sort of energy in the hallway that's
muffled between the doorway, and footsteps also

1719
02:24:44,168 --> 02:24:47,987
happening. As you're just starting to get through
his pockets you start hearing some sort of a

1720
02:24:47,987 --> 02:24:50,327
scuffle outside of the room.

1721
02:24:50,327 --> 02:24:51,670
WIL: I'm gone.

1722
02:24:51,670 --> 02:24:52,763
WILL: Me, too.

1723
02:24:52,763 --> 02:24:55,383
MATT: So I'll have you guys roll initiative, as
well.

1724
02:24:55,383 --> 02:25:03,721
WIL: Four.

1725
02:25:03,721 --> 02:25:05,626
MATT: All right.

1726
02:25:05,626 --> 02:25:13,011
LIAM: Not great. Nine.

1727
02:25:13,011 --> 02:25:15,007
WILL: 11.

1728
02:25:15,007 --> 02:25:23,999
WIL: There's 20 faces on this. So. I mean, look
right? It can happen. I know that it's possible.

1729
02:25:24,114 --> 02:25:26,297
I've done it in my life.

1730
02:25:26,297 --> 02:25:30,804
MATT: All right, so as you guys are turning, we'll
get to your turn in a moment. Tiberius and

1731
02:25:30,804 --> 02:25:32,648
Keyleth, you're up first.

1732
02:25:32,648 --> 02:25:39,135
MARISHA: Are we at the same time? I guess I'll go
ahead and cast out of my beast shape as well and

1733
02:25:39,135 --> 02:25:42,451
cast Hold Person on him as he's running away.

1734
02:25:42,451 --> 02:25:46,149
MATT: Okay. Cool. Just staying where you are? Are
you going to stay there or are you going to move?

1735
02:25:46,149 --> 02:25:47,600
MARISHA: Well, he's right there, right?

1736
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:49,215
MATT: Right there, yeah.

1737
02:25:49,215 --> 02:25:50,624
MARISHA: So I'm just going to try and hold him.

1738
02:25:50,624 --> 02:25:57,267
MATT: Okay, so you go ahead and cast Hold Person.
As the spell releases, you can see the mystical

1739
02:25:57,267 --> 02:26:02,423
shimmering cage that seems to encapsulate, seems
to shrug it off.

1740
02:26:02,423 --> 02:26:06,051
MARISHA: Because he's not a person! He's not a
person. I should've fucking done Grasping Vine.

1741
02:26:06,051 --> 02:26:07,976
Goddamn it. All right.

1742
02:26:07,976 --> 02:26:09,506
MATT: Do you want to move or are you staying where
you are?

1743
02:26:09,506 --> 02:26:11,556
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll follow after his ass.

1744
02:26:11,556 --> 02:26:15,159
MATT: All right, you can get up to pretty much
right adjacent to him if you want.

1745
02:26:15,159 --> 02:26:17,080
All right. Tiberius?

1746
02:26:17,080 --> 02:26:23,069
ORION: I'm going to cast Telekinesis and grab him
that way.

1747
02:26:23,069 --> 02:26:27,391
MATT: Okay. So from where you are you go ahead and
you create your telekinetic force, you rush out,

1748
02:26:27,391 --> 02:26:34,273
and the telekinetic force seems to have no effect
on the dwarf's form.

1749
02:26:34,273 --> 02:26:36,717
ORION: It's the rakshasa! That's him!

1750
02:26:36,717 --> 02:26:40,532
MATT: Do you move?

1751
02:26:40,532 --> 02:26:47,124
ORION: No. I yell at you, don't chase him!

1752
02:26:47,124 --> 02:26:50,251
MARISHA: And I go, what?

1753
02:26:50,251 --> 02:26:55,326
MATT: Which you don't hear, because she goes [no
audio].

1754
02:26:55,326 --> 02:26:57,392
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm in the silent bubble.

1755
02:26:57,392 --> 02:26:59,898
MATT: Yeah, there is currently no sound coming
from the center of that area.

1756
02:26:59,898 --> 02:27:01,089
ORION: But she can hear me.

1757
02:27:01,089 --> 02:27:02,060
MATT: She can hear you.

1758
02:27:02,060 --> 02:27:06,918
ORION: And I'm not that far. You heard me, the
other way! The other way! And I move in the room

1759
02:27:06,918 --> 02:27:08,353
with these guys.

1760
02:27:08,353 --> 02:27:12,251
MATT: Okay. As you guys turn, you see Tiberius
come rushing into the room.

1761
02:27:12,251 --> 02:27:17,033
ORION: The rakshasa! Nothing works on him! And I
think that's not normal!

1762
02:27:17,033 --> 02:27:18,872
LIAM: You're speaking Draconian!

1763
02:27:18,872 --> 02:27:29,260
ORION: Yes, sorry! Rakshasa. I believe the dwarf
is the rakshasa. I cast many things, and Keyleth

1764
02:27:29,260 --> 02:27:32,495
is in there, nothing hit him.

1765
02:27:32,495 --> 02:27:37,404
LIAM: You left her with him? I shove past him and
go straight through the door.

1766
02:27:37,404 --> 02:27:47,600
WIL: You ran away from the target? Ugh. I stomp
past him in my dwarfy stomps.

1767
02:27:47,600 --> 02:27:54,296
MATT: Hosin gets just out of the sphere of silence
and then angrily does a motion

1768
02:27:54,296 --> 02:27:55,952
with a hand and then--

1769
02:27:55,952 --> 02:27:58,658
(shouting)

1770
02:27:58,658 --> 02:28:00,752
MARISHA: I knew it was going to happen!

1771
02:28:00,752 --> 02:28:08,978
MATT: That'll bring us next to Brother Kash.
Kashaw. What do you want to do?

1772
02:28:08,978 --> 02:28:15,514
WILL: I want to go back eight moves and catch the
thing. I think what we're going to have to do now

1773
02:28:15,514 --> 02:28:20,716
is find out where he is. Let's Locate Creature
again, if we can.

1774
02:28:20,716 --> 02:28:26,875
MATT: Okay, this is during your turn. Is there
anything you want to do?

1775
02:28:26,875 --> 02:28:29,233
WILL: Can we locate creature, see how close he
is?

1776
02:28:29,233 --> 02:28:30,884
MATT: How long does it take to cast Locate
Creature?

1777
02:28:30,884 --> 02:28:33,055
WILL: I believe it is one action.

1778
02:28:33,055 --> 02:28:37,595
MATT: Okay, so you can do that, so you mark that
off as another casting of that spell.

1779
02:28:37,595 --> 02:28:38,719
WILL: Okay.

1780
02:28:38,719 --> 02:28:45,148
MATT: As you rush out into the hallway and see
that it's vanishing, you cast the spell for a

1781
02:28:45,148 --> 02:28:51,820
second, you can see the direction of the creature
is roughly ahead of you and you also see a door on

1782
02:28:51,820 --> 02:28:56,255
the opposite side, this right-hand door open and
close.

1783
02:28:56,255 --> 02:29:02,753
MARISHA: He goes invisible? He's not teleporting,
he's just invisible. That's a big thing.

1784
02:29:02,753 --> 02:29:05,438
WILL: Yeah, he's here. He's still here. We can't
see him.

1785
02:29:05,438 --> 02:29:08,671
MATT: You still have 15 feet of movement, if you
want to move forward.

1786
02:29:08,671 --> 02:29:10,229
WILL: Yeah, I would like to move forward.

1787
02:29:10,229 --> 02:29:14,902
MATT: Okay. So you'll get up to that point with
your turn. And you gather that that's the

1788
02:29:14,902 --> 02:29:17,745
direction of him, and that you know that's where
it's going.

1789
02:29:17,745 --> 02:29:20,984
WILL: I know where it's going, okay. So we saw the
door shut. That's where he is, let's go.

1790
02:29:20,984 --> 02:29:23,046
LIAM: Don't run blindly in there, hold on.

1791
02:29:23,046 --> 02:29:24,209
MATT: Vax, you're up.

1792
02:29:24,209 --> 02:29:32,903
LIAM: I'm going to run just up past Keyleth, I'm
going to look at her as I pass. Not bad. Keep

1793
02:29:32,903 --> 02:29:35,502
going, stop there, and now I'm going to try to
sense traps.

1794
02:29:35,502 --> 02:29:40,712
MATT: At this point, there? Okay, so you can get
up to here if you're going to use an action as

1795
02:29:40,712 --> 02:29:42,236
well to dash.

1796
02:29:42,236 --> 02:29:44,128
LIAM: If I use, that's fine, yeah.

1797
02:29:44,128 --> 02:29:48,559
MATT: Okay, as you go to talk to her no words come
out.

1798
02:29:48,559 --> 02:29:51,927
ORION: Can I see what's going on?

1799
02:29:51,927 --> 02:29:56,918
MATT: No, you're in the other room, still.
Everyone darted out and you're making your way

1800
02:29:56,918 --> 02:29:59,191
out. So go ahead and make a perception check.

1801
02:29:59,191 --> 02:30:02,120
LIAM: Okay. 21.

1802
02:30:02,120 --> 02:30:07,973
MATT: 21. Glancing about the room, there doesn't
appear to be anything that catches you as a trap.

1803
02:30:07,973 --> 02:30:14,762
This hallway is fairly often-traversed by the
clientele of this establishment, and nothing seems

1804
02:30:14,762 --> 02:30:18,132
dangerous. That would be difficult to put in the
middle of a place and still run a business.

1805
02:30:18,132 --> 02:30:27,091
LIAM: Okay. I look at Kash and Keyleth and say--
Are we out of initiative?

1806
02:30:27,091 --> 02:30:28,178
We're still in initiative.

1807
02:30:28,178 --> 02:30:29,501
MATT: We're still in initiative. Currently, for
the moment,

1808
02:30:29,501 --> 02:30:31,095
just for the sake of the pacing on this.

1809
02:30:31,095 --> 02:30:35,133
WIL: I'm going as far as I can down the hall
toward the direction of the bad guy.

1810
02:30:35,133 --> 02:30:41,476
MATT: Okay. That gets you to about there. Cool,
that ends that turn, at which point three of the

1811
02:30:41,476 --> 02:30:46,693
bouncers then start pushing through the silks. One
of them pushes his way here, this one pushes

1812
02:30:46,693 --> 02:30:55,480
aside, and they come out, weapons drawn, seeing
all of you there, and one of them goes [no audio].

1813
02:30:55,480 --> 02:31:04,256
That's their turn, but it looks like they're ready
to jump into some sort of combat circumstance.

1814
02:31:04,256 --> 02:31:07,172
That brings us to the top of the round, Tiberius,
you're up.

1815
02:31:07,172 --> 02:31:10,245
ORION: Where'd you say the guards came from?

1816
02:31:10,245 --> 02:31:14,749
MATT: They came from the main room, where the
silks are that separate the hallway from the main

1817
02:31:14,749 --> 02:31:20,978
area. And you start hearing people shouting and
some slight yelps and screams from the other

1818
02:31:20,978 --> 02:31:24,664
room.People who seem freaked out by the sudden
rise in energy.

1819
02:31:24,664 --> 02:31:26,471
ORION: What was that guy's name? Lohan?

1820
02:31:26,471 --> 02:31:27,546
WIL: Hosin?

1821
02:31:27,546 --> 02:31:28,571
ORION: Hosin?

1822
02:31:28,571 --> 02:31:31,590
WIL: The dwarf is Hosin. The other guy is Vince.

1823
02:31:31,590 --> 02:31:39,395
ORION: I just disperse Silence, and before I go
out, I turn into Hosin. Alter Self.

1824
02:31:39,395 --> 02:31:45,902
MATT: Okay, so you use your action to cast Alter
Self. You take Hosin's form, step out, closing the

1825
02:31:45,902 --> 02:31:47,559
door behind you.

1826
02:31:47,559 --> 02:31:49,610
ORION: How did he sound, again?

1827
02:31:49,610 --> 02:31:51,133
MATT: How did he sound?

1828
02:31:51,133 --> 02:31:52,525
ORION: I don't remember.

1829
02:31:52,525 --> 02:31:54,188
MARISHA: He's a dwarf.

1830
02:31:54,188 --> 02:31:57,637
WILL: He was Scottish, but fancy Scottish.

1831
02:31:57,637 --> 02:32:00,214
LIAM: He's glam rock. Glam rock.

1832
02:32:00,214 --> 02:32:02,873
ORION: Oh, right, right. What's all this noise out
here?

1833
02:32:02,873 --> 02:32:06,417
What are you bothering my friends for? Guards!

1834
02:32:06,417 --> 02:32:10,559
MATT: The guards look over confused and, "We heard
there was a--"

1835
02:32:10,559 --> 02:32:16,304
ORION: Everything's fine. These are friends. Get
on with your business. Get back on patrol. Make

1836
02:32:16,304 --> 02:32:18,823
sure nothing happens or I'll have your heads.

1837
02:32:18,823 --> 02:32:20,807
MATT: Make a deception check.

1838
02:32:20,807 --> 02:32:25,545
MARISHA: Oh, come on, Tiberius.

1839
02:32:25,545 --> 02:32:27,141
ORION: 28.

1840
02:32:27,141 --> 02:32:35,258
MATT: The guards look at each other. "All right,
but if anything happens again, there's a problem,

1841
02:32:35,258 --> 02:32:41,534
"let us know. We'll be at the ready." They sheathe
their weapons and look untrustingly to the rest of

1842
02:32:41,534 --> 02:32:44,411
your group with your weapons currently drawn and
step back--

1843
02:32:44,411 --> 02:32:45,882
ORION: Go on, get out.

1844
02:32:45,882 --> 02:32:50,273
MATT: They disappear back into the main room and
they start calming down some of the other patrons

1845
02:32:50,273 --> 02:32:53,637
who are starting to peek around them, trying to
see what's going on, the action. Some look smiling

1846
02:32:53,637 --> 02:32:57,871
and curious to see what's happening, and they're,
"Go back to your tables. It's fine; there's no

1847
02:32:57,871 --> 02:33:00,484
"problem." And they disperse the energy.

1848
02:33:00,484 --> 02:33:05,087
LIAM: Not bad, Tiberius.

1849
02:33:05,087 --> 02:33:17,142
MARISHA: With that, I continue with the charade
and loop my arm around Vax and say, shall we go

1850
02:33:17,142 --> 02:33:19,148
into that room?

1851
02:33:19,148 --> 02:33:27,119
LIAM: Just a moment, dear. Pull out the same
poisoned blade and start walking down that hall a

1852
02:33:27,119 --> 02:33:31,065
little further, and I want to see if I sense any
traps further ahead.

1853
02:33:31,065 --> 02:33:34,160
MATT: Okay, to about there? Make a perception
check.

1854
02:33:34,160 --> 02:33:36,785
LIAM: Natural 20.

1855
02:33:36,785 --> 02:33:51,977
WIL: And balance was restored to the universe. Oh
god, don't do that! Come on!

1856
02:33:51,977 --> 02:33:57,528
MATT: Put it away. Watch as the dice just like
turns to dust.

1857
02:33:57,528 --> 02:34:01,288
WIL: It's the end of Raiders.

1858
02:34:01,288 --> 02:34:06,306
MATT: Exactly. You glance about the room as you're
walking forward carefully, looking at the

1859
02:34:06,306 --> 02:34:09,877
floorboards, looking at the tapestries on the
walls, looking for anything that would be out of

1860
02:34:09,877 --> 02:34:14,174
sorts, and your eyes very keen to find anything
out of the ordinary. The room thankfully does not

1861
02:34:14,174 --> 02:34:16,702
appear to have anything specifically trapped. It
seems fairly safe.

1862
02:34:16,702 --> 02:34:20,096
LIAM: Oh. Okay. And those are doors up there?

1863
02:34:20,096 --> 02:34:21,693
MATT: Yeah. Door to the right, door to the left.

1864
02:34:21,693 --> 02:34:23,895
LIAM: Would that check include the doors
themselves?

1865
02:34:23,895 --> 02:34:27,639
MATT: I would say with a natural 20, yes. The
doors both also seem to be functional doors, not

1866
02:34:27,639 --> 02:34:29,460
designed with any sort of trap attached.

1867
02:34:29,460 --> 02:34:31,774
LIAM: All right. Pressing my ear to the door on my
left.

1868
02:34:31,774 --> 02:34:37,076
MATT: Okay. Listen to it. Perception roll.

1869
02:34:37,076 --> 02:34:39,922
LIAM: So many. Six.

1870
02:34:39,922 --> 02:34:41,547
MATT: Seems fairly quiet.

1871
02:34:41,547 --> 02:34:44,716
ORION: If we've stopped pursuing, does that take
us out of initiative?

1872
02:34:44,716 --> 02:34:47,874
MATT: You guys are not, you guys are not currently
in initiative because you're not in the thick of

1873
02:34:47,874 --> 02:34:50,296
battle. You managed to disperse the conflict.

1874
02:34:50,296 --> 02:34:52,158
LIAM: I want to do it at the other door as well.

1875
02:34:52,158 --> 02:34:54,393
MATT: All right, you step to the other door. You
guys want to do anything else while you're waiting

1876
02:34:54,393 --> 02:34:55,589
on him?

1877
02:34:55,589 --> 02:34:59,589
WIL: I'm just going to come, I want to get as
close to him as I can and I'm ready for a fight.

1878
02:34:59,589 --> 02:35:00,806
MARISHA: Yeah, I follow.

1879
02:35:00,806 --> 02:35:08,401
ORION: Thorbir. Do you have an extra sword or arm
on you? Perhaps a shortsword?

1880
02:35:08,401 --> 02:35:11,683
WIL: I give him the jeweled dagger.

1881
02:35:11,683 --> 02:35:13,513
LIAM: That one's a 19.

1882
02:35:13,513 --> 02:35:21,973
MATT: 19? Listening, you hear what sounds like a
slight (creak) sound, some sort of a scooting of

1883
02:35:21,973 --> 02:35:24,533
wood on wood, and then silence.

1884
02:35:24,533 --> 02:35:26,757
LIAM: Kick in the door. Hard as I can.

1885
02:35:26,757 --> 02:35:30,675
MATT: Okay. Make a strength roll. This would be
straight strength.

1886
02:35:30,675 --> 02:35:37,437
LIAM: Wait, that's the wrong guy. 12. 14.

1887
02:35:37,437 --> 02:35:41,446
ORION: As he's doing that, I'm going to drink a
potion of frost giant strength.

1888
02:35:41,446 --> 02:35:50,069
MATT: Okay. You slam your foot into the door. Oh,
that was the foot that you just got healed. Oh,

1889
02:35:50,069 --> 02:35:54,527
that's going to bruise. That's really going to
bruise.

1890
02:35:54,527 --> 02:35:58,016
LIAM: Keyleth-- Coralin, darling, could you come
up here please?

1891
02:35:58,016 --> 02:36:01,226
MARISHA: Yes? Did you stub your toe, darling?

1892
02:36:01,226 --> 02:36:06,050
LIAM: Yeah. I think I want to get this door open
quickly, please.

1893
02:36:06,050 --> 02:36:07,943
WIL: I'm going to hit the door with my axe.

1894
02:36:07,943 --> 02:36:14,016
MATT: Okay. Go for it and roll. What did you
roll?

1895
02:36:14,016 --> 02:36:15,894
LIAM: A one!

1896
02:36:15,894 --> 02:36:22,907
MARISHA: No way! It's a lie. If it wasn't live, no
one would believe it.

1897
02:36:22,907 --> 02:36:28,540
WIL: I rolled a one. Because it is what I do.

1898
02:36:28,540 --> 02:36:34,700
MATT: I'm going to test this theory. I'm going to
trade you, for now, and I'm going to leave you

1899
02:36:34,700 --> 02:36:39,036
with that dice and see if it has any impact
whatsoever.

1900
02:36:39,036 --> 02:36:42,612
LIAM: You have to throw it into the fire, Mr.
Frodo!

1901
02:36:42,612 --> 02:36:47,682
WIL: The curse doesn't care about which die is
rolled.

1902
02:36:47,682 --> 02:36:50,135
MATT: Which is very possible, but there needs to
be--

1903
02:36:50,135 --> 02:36:52,247
LIAM: This is like science class.

1904
02:36:52,247 --> 02:36:57,244
MARISHA: Maybe it's because that dice was in the
vicinity of Matt's hair, you'll be good.

1905
02:36:57,244 --> 02:37:03,334
MATT: All right.

1906
02:37:03,334 --> 02:37:08,271
WIL: So how much damage do I take for some
reason?

1907
02:37:08,271 --> 02:37:14,523
MATT: So as you pull back the axe, you actually
swing wildly backward, nearly hitting Vax in the

1908
02:37:14,523 --> 02:37:18,847
process. You have to dodge out of the way as the
axe embeds itself into the wood behind you.

1909
02:37:18,847 --> 02:37:23,295
WIL: Ugh. Again.

1910
02:37:23,295 --> 02:37:25,075
MATT: Axe is stuck.

1911
02:37:25,075 --> 02:37:30,380
LIAM: I slap myself on the forehead and go ugh.
Pull out thieves' pick and start on the lock.

1912
02:37:30,380 --> 02:37:38,934
MATT: Okay, you unclasp. As you do, you feel your
throat seize suddenly as the cold liquid tends to

1913
02:37:38,934 --> 02:37:47,289
freeze up what is normally a very warm and very
fire-breeding interior to your throat. And it

1914
02:37:47,289 --> 02:37:55,268
thaws slowly, and as you exhale you can see the
mist, and suddenly your muscles pulse with energy

1915
02:37:55,268 --> 02:38:00,046
and you feel like your physical form is embodied
strength far more than you've ever felt in your

1916
02:38:00,046 --> 02:38:01,680
body before.

1917
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:06,694
ORION: With his jeweled dagger, I take out my
dagger. I feel great.

1918
02:38:06,694 --> 02:38:08,452
LIAM: The freshmaker.

1919
02:38:08,452 --> 02:38:12,786
MATT: There's now the angriest dwarf right now
clutching two daggers as you get down with your

1920
02:38:12,786 --> 02:38:13,987
thieves' tools.

1921
02:38:13,987 --> 02:38:17,396
LIAM: Yeah, let's try to leave the room. That's
better. That's a 24.

1922
02:38:17,396 --> 02:38:27,453
MATT: All right. The door swings open without
issue. It's one of the easier jobs you've had.

1923
02:38:27,453 --> 02:38:29,248
LIAM: I should've done that in the first place.

1924
02:38:29,248 --> 02:38:31,984
MARISHA: Yeah! Should've beat it down and then.

1925
02:38:31,984 --> 02:38:35,850
MATT: You push open the door and find your way
into what looks like a very well-adorned bedroom.

1926
02:38:35,850 --> 02:38:41,618
There is a small table on the side where there are
some books stacked up. There's a dresser on the

1927
02:38:41,618 --> 02:38:48,729
far end that's closed. There is a canopy bed set
up. There is a small end-table on the side. And

1928
02:38:48,729 --> 02:38:55,127
the rest of the room has a nice circular rug
that's thrown across the center, and there are no

1929
02:38:55,127 --> 02:38:57,239
windows currently to this room.

1930
02:38:57,239 --> 02:39:03,050
LIAM: I turn my head to everyone and just mouth
the words-- and perception check the room.

1931
02:39:03,050 --> 02:39:06,037
MARISHA: Can I perception check, as well?

1932
02:39:06,037 --> 02:39:07,312
LIAM: 24.

1933
02:39:07,312 --> 02:39:11,795
MARISHA: Can I just look to see, I want to just
meditate and-- what did you just roll? 24?

1934
02:39:11,795 --> 02:39:12,759
LIAM: 24.

1935
02:39:12,759 --> 02:39:18,008
MARISHA: I want to see if I see any movements or
brushes of cloth or anything like that.

1936
02:39:18,008 --> 02:39:19,388
MATT: Okay.

1937
02:39:19,388 --> 02:39:22,837
MARISHA: 19. Not as good as Vax.

1938
02:39:22,837 --> 02:39:24,681
MATT: All right.

1939
02:39:24,681 --> 02:39:31,049
WIL: How long does it take me to pull the axe out
of the wall, and how far into Yakety Sax does the

1940
02:39:31,049 --> 02:39:40,088
soundtrack get while I'm up there and with the
foot and then I'm jumping on it and trying to pull

1941
02:39:40,088 --> 02:39:41,563
it down.

1942
02:39:41,563 --> 02:39:46,701
MATT: We're currently hitting the one minute 15
second mark. Haven't quite pulled it out of the

1943
02:39:46,701 --> 02:39:47,783
wood yet.

1944
02:39:47,783 --> 02:39:53,090
WIL: Okay, good. And my little legs are kicking
underneath me while I pull it down, cursing in

1945
02:39:53,090 --> 02:39:53,988
Dwarven.

1946
02:39:53,988 --> 02:39:56,944
LIAM: They call me Benny. Benny Hill.

1947
02:39:56,944 --> 02:40:01,215
MATT: Do you wish to enter the room?

1948
02:40:01,215 --> 02:40:06,590
WILL: I don't, actually. Because of all the sound,
I wish to turn my back to the room and guard the

1949
02:40:06,590 --> 02:40:08,935
hallway while everybody else is inside checking
out the room.

1950
02:40:08,935 --> 02:40:11,132
MATT: Okay, you're keeping an eye out, and you do
see that there's one of the guards just to the

1951
02:40:11,132 --> 02:40:16,184
side who's just keeping an eye looking over
carefully. You guys make a perception check,

1952
02:40:16,184 --> 02:40:20,741
looking around the room, you see there is no
movement, there are no curtains on the walls.

1953
02:40:20,741 --> 02:40:26,783
There is the rug, and most everything else in here
seems to be perfectly still. You catch what looks

1954
02:40:26,783 --> 02:40:32,476
like a little bit of movement of the canopy bed,
the material that's on top. There's a slight sway

1955
02:40:32,476 --> 02:40:37,830
to it that comes to stillness you just barely
catch with your keen half-elven eye.

1956
02:40:37,830 --> 02:40:50,012
LIAM: I would like to run up the bed and stab up.
Both hands. Clicking the Boots of Haste.

1957
02:40:50,012 --> 02:40:54,639
MATT: Okay. (bam) Click the Boots of Haste, you
run and charge up into the bed and stab upward

1958
02:40:54,639 --> 02:41:02,060
into the canopy. The material is torn asunder,
this very fine, probably imported silk is carved

1959
02:41:02,060 --> 02:41:07,513
into three separate ribbons and falls gently onto
the cushion of the bed proper, revealing the

1960
02:41:07,513 --> 02:41:09,395
hardwood ceiling above you.

1961
02:41:09,395 --> 02:41:18,960
LIAM: I'm going to check the ceiling. There's a
lot of perception. I'm all out of Luck. That's no

1962
02:41:18,960 --> 02:41:20,676
good. That's a 14.

1963
02:41:20,676 --> 02:41:24,019
MATT: 14, looking about, it's solid wood, you can
move your fingers along and you're standing on the

1964
02:41:24,019 --> 02:41:27,224
bed, you can just get it within reach, and feeling
along the board, it's all pretty solid.

1965
02:41:27,224 --> 02:41:38,303
MARISHA: I want to make myself soccer field goalie
this stuff with the door, in the door frame, just

1966
02:41:38,303 --> 02:41:43,235
really trying to see if I can see any brush of
dust or movement.

1967
02:41:43,235 --> 02:41:52,054
MATT: Okay. Keeping an eye out. You pull your axe
free. Into the hallway door in front of you. Not a

1968
02:41:52,054 --> 02:41:55,271
lot of strength. You pull it out and try the best
you can to save some grace.

1969
02:41:55,271 --> 02:42:00,071
WILL: Well done. Yeah, that was graceful.

1970
02:42:00,071 --> 02:42:02,447
LIAM: I motion Tiberius over.

1971
02:42:02,447 --> 02:42:09,225
ORION: Should I do a perception on that? Nope.

1972
02:42:09,225 --> 02:42:12,495
MATT: That ceiling looks pretty solid.

1973
02:42:12,495 --> 02:42:17,529
WILL: Can I turn, saving my back to the door, I
turn over. I do a perception check.

1974
02:42:17,529 --> 02:42:20,068
MATT: Go for it. You step over, you glance past
Keyleth.

1975
02:42:20,068 --> 02:42:21,434
WILL: Oh my god, one.

1976
02:42:21,434 --> 02:42:27,970
WIL: Stop trying to steal my thing, you guys.

1977
02:42:27,970 --> 02:42:32,513
MATT: You glance over and you're more distracted
by the fact that Keyleth is doing this awkward

1978
02:42:32,513 --> 02:42:37,596
field goal thing in the door to you for no reason,
and you forget

1979
02:42:37,596 --> 02:42:39,415
what you were in the middle of doing.

1980
02:42:39,415 --> 02:42:40,649
MARISHA: I'm trying to make myself big.

1981
02:42:40,649 --> 02:42:42,845
MATT: There appears to be no exit from the
ceiling.

1982
02:42:42,845 --> 02:42:44,097
WIL: Can I enter the room?

1983
02:42:44,097 --> 02:42:46,163
MATT: You may. You push past the confused cleric.

1984
02:42:46,163 --> 02:42:53,691
WIL: Okay, so I look around. I look at the rug. I
sigh heavily. And I pull the rug.

1985
02:42:53,691 --> 02:42:59,086
MATT: You pull the rug, revealing a wooden floor.
Plain slats.

1986
02:42:59,086 --> 02:43:01,098
MARISHA: You thought that was going to be good!

1987
02:43:01,098 --> 02:43:05,778
WILL: With a point, too!

1988
02:43:05,778 --> 02:43:13,676
MATT: You were never a fan of elves or half-elves
before, but this one's really starting to dig into

1989
02:43:13,676 --> 02:43:15,094
you a little.

1990
02:43:15,094 --> 02:43:21,354
WIL: I'll make a perception check because we could
total up all my rolls and I'd have five.

1991
02:43:21,354 --> 02:43:23,755
LIAM: Come on. Hey!

1992
02:43:23,755 --> 02:43:27,383
WIL: Look at that. That's actually better. 20.

1993
02:43:27,383 --> 02:43:32,438
MATT: 20. You pull the rug back. There's nothing
there, and you look about at the rest of the folks

1994
02:43:32,438 --> 02:43:40,394
with a heavy sigh. But the rug was on the right
track. Everyone was keeping high. Looking beneath

1995
02:43:40,394 --> 02:43:48,220
the bed, you can see what looks to be, in the
shadow, some little bit of elevated wood that

1996
02:43:48,220 --> 02:43:50,351
catches your attention.

1997
02:43:50,351 --> 02:43:58,190
WIL: I just, under the bed!

1998
02:43:58,190 --> 02:44:01,581
ORION: Oh! I'll motion over there.

1999
02:44:01,581 --> 02:44:08,062
LIAM: We're not silenced, right? So I'm yanking
off any fancy clothes I have on and I'm pulling my

2000
02:44:08,062 --> 02:44:14,285
Cloak of Elvenkind out. I'm putting it over. And I
spider under the bed and check it for traps.

2001
02:44:14,285 --> 02:44:17,519
MARISHA: I pick up his clothes and I put them in
the Bag of Holding.

2002
02:44:17,519 --> 02:44:19,657
WILL: Oh my god, she's folding the clothes. We're
in the middle of this,

2003
02:44:19,657 --> 02:44:20,881
and she's folding the clothes.

2004
02:44:20,881 --> 02:44:23,184
MARISHA: They might come in handy later.

2005
02:44:23,184 --> 02:44:25,343
LIAM: 25 for looking for traps.

2006
02:44:25,343 --> 02:44:28,799
MATT: Okay. Well, it's a good thing you rolled
high enough perception, because as you spider

2007
02:44:28,799 --> 02:44:35,521
underneath, your first hand goes underneath and
you nearly tumble and you catch yourself. There is

2008
02:44:35,521 --> 02:44:41,570
a five-foot-wide hole in the ground right beneath
this bed. And as you catch yourself, you can feel

2009
02:44:41,570 --> 02:44:47,816
a little bit of wind slowly drifting up from
underneath. There's some sort of airflow coming up

2010
02:44:47,816 --> 02:44:50,836
from underneath this bed where this hole is, and
you feel over and you can see that little bit of

2011
02:44:50,836 --> 02:44:55,300
wood that you saw looking forward is the top of a
makeshift ladder that is currently fastened to the

2012
02:44:55,300 --> 02:44:57,521
side of this tunnel that disappears beneath the
room.

2013
02:44:57,521 --> 02:44:58,908
LIAM: Is there dim light down there?

2014
02:44:58,908 --> 02:45:03,475
MATT: It is pitch black. You can see with the dim
light from your low-light vision a little ways

2015
02:45:03,475 --> 02:45:08,859
into it, about 20 or so feet from the angle you're
at, because you're not looking directly in. And

2016
02:45:08,859 --> 02:45:12,129
even just glancing over the side it continues down
for quite a while.

2017
02:45:12,129 --> 02:45:16,292
WILL: And it's big enough to fit all of us if we
wanted to go.

2018
02:45:16,292 --> 02:45:19,567
MATT: Independently, yes. One person would go
down. It would be single file, of course, because

2019
02:45:19,567 --> 02:45:21,430
it's a tight tunnel.

2020
02:45:21,430 --> 02:45:24,215
WILL: Only one way to go, right?

2021
02:45:24,215 --> 02:45:26,583
LIAM: You can see in pitch black, right?

2022
02:45:26,583 --> 02:45:29,376
WIL: I have darkvision, 60 feet.

2023
02:45:29,376 --> 02:45:31,631
LIAM: Is that dim or dark?

2024
02:45:31,631 --> 02:45:32,621
WIL: Dark.

2025
02:45:32,621 --> 02:45:38,502
MATT: Darkvision, you can see within a short
distance of pitch black and then a larger distance at

2026
02:45:38,502 --> 02:45:39,899
low light, so yeah.

2027
02:45:39,899 --> 02:45:41,253
WIL: I'll go.

2028
02:45:41,253 --> 02:45:47,699
MATT: All right. So we'll put in order here, who's
going down next? All right. And after Vax?

2029
02:45:47,699 --> 02:45:50,224
MARISHA: I'll follow my husband.

2030
02:45:50,224 --> 02:45:52,498
MATT: Keyleth. That's weird. Tiberius?

2031
02:45:52,498 --> 02:45:58,712
ORION: Before we go down, I'm going to take off my
outer-- no, I can't take off anything because

2032
02:45:58,712 --> 02:46:05,462
that's all my gear. Never mind. I don't do that,
but before we go down I cast Stoneskin on myself.

2033
02:46:05,462 --> 02:46:07,908
I cast that right now.

2034
02:46:07,908 --> 02:46:13,614
MATT: Okay. As your form shimmers for a second and
you see-- you notice this too, Kashaw-- his scales

2035
02:46:13,614 --> 02:46:18,782
almost seem to protrude into earthy spikes and
then form and solidify, almost like his body

2036
02:46:18,782 --> 02:46:20,644
becomes its own suit of armor.

2037
02:46:20,644 --> 02:46:21,852
WILL: Okay, that's cool.

2038
02:46:21,852 --> 02:46:23,839
ORION: Even though I'm still a dwarf, though.

2039
02:46:23,839 --> 02:46:27,505
WILL: I'm going to go, but I'm going to cast
Freedom of Movement

2040
02:46:27,505 --> 02:46:29,232
on myself before I go down there.

2041
02:46:29,232 --> 02:46:34,552
MATT: Okay. As you do, even with the encumbrance
of the armor you're wearing, you feel like your

2042
02:46:34,660 --> 02:46:40,636
form is a little more agile and you're ready for
anything that might try and stop your passage. You

2043
02:46:40,636 --> 02:46:47,436
guys begin making your way down, with Thorbir
leading the way. You descend for a good three to

2044
02:46:47,436 --> 02:46:52,149
four minutes, you gather probably a hundred feet
or more down, rung by rung, and there are a few

2045
02:46:52,149 --> 02:46:57,093
that you reach that are a little rickety. About a
hundred feet down, one hits your foot and snaps,

2046
02:46:57,093 --> 02:47:02,072
but you manage to catch yourself on it, but you
get the feeling this ladder is probably not meant

2047
02:47:02,072 --> 02:47:06,245
to hold someone of your heavy physical form.

2048
02:47:06,245 --> 02:47:07,854
WIL: Largesse?

2049
02:47:07,854 --> 02:47:13,322
MATT: Largesse, you could use, yes. One by one,
you make your way down until eventually you're,

2050
02:47:13,322 --> 02:47:20,761
you begin to see towards the edge of your
darkvision, floor finally begins to appear and rise

2051
02:47:20,761 --> 02:47:27,179
towards you. You step off the ladder into what
appears to be a small circular area that leads

2052
02:47:27,179 --> 02:47:34,126
into another ten-foot-by-ten-foot tunnel, ten by
15 foot up, and continues forward. This is very

2053
02:47:34,126 --> 02:47:37,147
natural carved earth, it's not smoothed stone, it
just looks like a tunnel

2054
02:47:37,147 --> 02:47:39,284
that was mined out of the floor.

2055
02:47:39,284 --> 02:47:40,447
WILL: Is it still dark?

2056
02:47:40,447 --> 02:47:42,378
MATT: It is still dark, there is no light source
currently.

2057
02:47:42,378 --> 02:47:44,053
And you all eventually make your way down.

2058
02:47:44,053 --> 02:47:46,563
WILL: Is there anything loose down there that I
can grab a hold of?

2059
02:47:46,563 --> 02:47:50,738
MATT: You can't see anything. Mr. Human, you are
in pitch-black darkness.

2060
02:47:50,738 --> 02:47:55,107
WILL: Well, that's why I'm wondering if I feel
around underneath me to try to find some kind-- do

2061
02:47:55,107 --> 02:47:57,786
I find a loose stone? Do I find a pebble? Can I
find anything to grab?

2062
02:47:57,786 --> 02:48:00,497
MATT: Reach down, yeah, you manage to find a
couple of small stones.

2063
02:48:00,497 --> 02:48:02,070
ORION: As he's milling about, Light.

2064
02:48:02,070 --> 02:48:04,496
WILL: That's what I was going to do, but he beat
me to it. Thank you.

2065
02:48:04,496 --> 02:48:11,388
MATT: So you reach down and you find a stone, you
pick it up, you begrudgingly grab your holy

2066
02:48:11,388 --> 02:48:17,046
symbol, and as you begin to recite your cantrip
incantation, a flash of white light comes gleaming

2067
02:48:17,046 --> 02:48:20,048
off the top of the dragonborn sorcerer's staff.

2068
02:48:20,048 --> 02:48:22,868
ORION: Dagger. Because I have two daggers in my
hands.

2069
02:48:22,868 --> 02:48:26,569
MATT: That's true. One of the daggers is now
glowing. The jeweled one, twice as pretty when

2070
02:48:26,569 --> 02:48:28,571
it's emanating torchlight.

2071
02:48:28,571 --> 02:48:32,279
WILL: Nice. Thanks for the warning, by the way.

2072
02:48:32,279 --> 02:48:34,637
ORION: Sorry, I usually just do it when it's
dark.

2073
02:48:34,637 --> 02:48:36,728
WIL: This tunnel goes in just one direction?

2074
02:48:36,728 --> 02:48:37,973
MATT: One direction.

2075
02:48:37,973 --> 02:48:40,079
WIL: I'm walking down the tunnel.

2076
02:48:40,079 --> 02:48:51,775
MATT: Okay. So we'll say for the sake of marching
order, who all is going in after Thorbir?

2077
02:48:51,775 --> 02:48:53,808
In what order?

2078
02:48:53,808 --> 02:48:55,350
WILL: I'll go next.

2079
02:48:55,350 --> 02:48:56,779
MATT: All right. Following Thorbir.

2080
02:48:56,779 --> 02:48:59,346
LIAM: I'll go behind Kash.

2081
02:48:59,346 --> 02:49:02,581
WILL: I don't need this at all, but I just wanted
to play with it. That's me right there.

2082
02:49:02,581 --> 02:49:08,644
ORION: I'll follow. I'll keep on Thorbir's six.

2083
02:49:08,644 --> 02:49:10,235
MATT: Okay.

2084
02:49:10,235 --> 02:49:13,597
ORION: I'll stay 15 feet behind him.

2085
02:49:13,597 --> 02:49:18,599
MATT: 15 feet behind? All right. And Keyleth, you
continue up that way. All right, so that'll be the

2086
02:49:18,599 --> 02:49:19,900
marching order.

2087
02:49:19,900 --> 02:49:26,675
WIL: So I've got my axe out. And may I make a
perception check to see what I see? To just see if

2088
02:49:26,675 --> 02:49:30,246
I can pick up footprints or motion or whatever?

2089
02:49:30,246 --> 02:49:37,148
MATT: This would be more tracking, if you're
looking for footprints, so that'd be wisdom.

2090
02:49:37,148 --> 02:49:42,102
WIL: Okay. Just a straight wisdom?

2091
02:49:42,102 --> 02:49:43,489
MATT: Survival.

2092
02:49:43,489 --> 02:49:48,977
WIL: Survival, hang on. Not my system. Eight.

2093
02:49:48,977 --> 02:49:58,235
MATT: Eight? Okay. It's hard to tell. It looks
like this area is not heavily traversed, and what

2094
02:49:58,235 --> 02:50:02,740
little sign of footprints there are scattered
enough that it's hard to make out a specific

2095
02:50:02,740 --> 02:50:05,863
print. But I mean, they have been traveled
before.

2096
02:50:05,863 --> 02:50:12,296
LIAM: I'm looking over Thorbir's head and looking
for traps as he walks from behind. 22.

2097
02:50:12,296 --> 02:50:19,661
MATT: 22? All right. As you guys are walking
forward and going through this, you get about 40

2098
02:50:19,661 --> 02:50:26,303
feet forward before you catch that there is a
slight divot, a small drop in the dirt, and one

2099
02:50:26,303 --> 02:50:32,850
looks like a section of intentionally placed plate
of some kind.

2100
02:50:32,850 --> 02:50:39,628
LIAM: Wait a tick. I'm going to go up to the edge
of it and try to inspect it and see if I can find

2101
02:50:39,628 --> 02:50:47,281
a trigger or see how it works. Six. And that is,
what is that, perception?

2102
02:50:47,281 --> 02:50:49,314
MATT: Are you checking to see how it works?

2103
02:50:49,314 --> 02:50:51,522
LIAM: I want to see if I can disarm.

2104
02:50:51,522 --> 02:50:55,861
MATT: To disarm it. Okay, that would be with your
thieves' tools. So this would be a dexterity plus

2105
02:50:55,861 --> 02:50:57,741
your thieves' tools, so plus seven.

2106
02:50:57,741 --> 02:50:59,245
LIAM: That's a 19.

2107
02:50:59,245 --> 02:51:05,274
MATT: 19? Okay. As you go to the plate, you stop
and look up at the walls to the side, and to each

2108
02:51:05,274 --> 02:51:08,860
side of the wall you can see these tiny little
holes, these little quarter-sized,

2109
02:51:08,860 --> 02:51:17,143
gold-piece-sized tunnels bored multiple places on
both sides of this wall. And you take the plate,

2110
02:51:17,143 --> 02:51:23,616
you realize this is a pressure plate-based trap,
and taking one dagger, you slightly lift it. The

2111
02:51:23,616 --> 02:51:30,764
second one, you eventually find beneath where the
trigger apparatus is, and you gingerly cut each

2112
02:51:30,764 --> 02:51:35,423
part of these spring-loaded triggers until
eventually the plate rises more and more and more

2113
02:51:35,423 --> 02:51:40,552
and you remove the last bit, the plate tips over,
and the trap itself is disarmed.

2114
02:51:40,552 --> 02:51:42,323
WILL: Nice work.

2115
02:51:42,323 --> 02:51:44,651
ORION: I mean, well done, rogue.

2116
02:51:44,651 --> 02:51:55,787
WIL: So I keep going down. I want to hit a thing.

2117
02:51:55,787 --> 02:51:58,506
MATT: All righty.

2118
02:51:58,506 --> 02:52:00,440
WIL: That's not a wall.

2119
02:52:00,440 --> 02:52:11,434
MATT: There is that. All right. Pushing forward,
continuing for another 30-40 feet, do you want to

2120
02:52:11,434 --> 02:52:12,824
check traps again?

2121
02:52:12,824 --> 02:52:14,784
LIAM: Again. 12.

2122
02:52:14,784 --> 02:52:21,045
MATT: 12? Okay. Pushing forward for a period of
time, there doesn't appear to be any change. There

2123
02:52:21,045 --> 02:52:25,784
are no more divots. You're keeping a very close
eye for the traps. And as you're walking forward

2124
02:52:25,784 --> 02:52:31,061
with your axe. As you're stepping forward you get
this weird tickle across your nose, like a spider

2125
02:52:31,061 --> 02:52:35,216
web of some kind that catches you, and you
instinctively reach up and brush it away from your

2126
02:52:35,216 --> 02:52:40,344
nose. As your finger presses against it, it's much
sturdier than a spider web. It's a metallic wire,

2127
02:52:40,344 --> 02:52:50,921
and as you push away (tink). You hear that slight
noise. Tiberius, behind you, you hear a grinding

2128
02:52:50,921 --> 02:53:00,943
of stone, and a loud slam sounds, like something
extremely heavy just dropped behind you.

2129
02:53:00,943 --> 02:53:02,590
MARISHA: Run!

2130
02:53:02,590 --> 02:53:06,859
MATT: You guys glance over your shoulder and you
see what looks to be a fairly rounded boulder--

2131
02:53:06,859 --> 02:53:12,400
ORION: I dispel Alter Self immediately so I have
longer-ass legs.

2132
02:53:12,400 --> 02:53:15,840
MATT: Well, Alter Self is gone if you're casting
Stoneskin, because that's a concentration spell.

2133
02:53:15,840 --> 02:53:20,371
Oh, that. But that only carries it for a few
rounds. It's been a longer time than that.

2134
02:53:20,371 --> 02:53:24,571
ORION: It's been 15 minutes. Time has passed.
Never mind. I don't do shit.

2135
02:53:24,571 --> 02:53:27,483
MATT: But yeah, don't worry about that. But the
stone boulder just--

2136
02:53:27,483 --> 02:53:29,338
MARISHA: Indiana Jones, motherfuckers!

2137
02:53:29,338 --> 02:53:36,500
MATT: Picking up speed with the slow decline of
this room. All of you guys, what are you doing?

2138
02:53:36,500 --> 02:53:38,409
ALL: Run!

2139
02:53:38,409 --> 02:53:40,070
MATT: You're bolting forward.

2140
02:53:40,070 --> 02:53:42,069
ORION: I cast Fly on myself and fly.

2141
02:53:42,069 --> 02:53:50,160
MATT: You cast Fly, pushing forward, and you guys
get a little speed, but you've noticed the

2142
02:53:50,160 --> 02:53:54,780
boulder's started to gather steam as it continues
down, and the pathway you guys are running is

2143
02:53:54,780 --> 02:53:58,791
going at a heavier and heavier decline as you push
forward.

2144
02:53:58,791 --> 02:54:04,666
ORION: Oh! As I'm flying, I turn around with my
ring and I cast Slow on the boulder.

2145
02:54:04,666 --> 02:54:14,727
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a-- actually, no.
This is interesting. Let me see if Slow would have

2146
02:54:14,727 --> 02:54:24,568
a direct effect on this boulder. That's something
that happens right now that I didn't consider. I

2147
02:54:24,568 --> 02:54:29,957
love when that happens. Unfortunately, it is not a
creature and actually it affects the physical

2148
02:54:29,957 --> 02:54:36,929
metabolism and muscle use of an individual. This
is just a solid structured object. As you release

2149
02:54:36,929 --> 02:54:42,097
the spell, you see the air around it poof, and
drift a little slower, and the boulder seems to

2150
02:54:42,097 --> 02:54:47,865
stutter for a moment, but continues to push
forward. That was your action.

2151
02:54:47,865 --> 02:54:49,824
ORION: Damn it.

2152
02:54:49,824 --> 02:54:54,369
LIAM: I would like to cast all of my spells in
succession for the next ten minutes.

2153
02:54:54,369 --> 02:54:59,635
MATT: I assume you're going full sprint? Okay, so
pushing forward, you all push forward, Tiberius

2154
02:54:59,635 --> 02:55:03,781
who has stopped to turn around and cast the spell
is not at a full dash, so he trails behind. The

2155
02:55:03,781 --> 02:55:05,929
boulder is currently gaining on Tiberius.

2156
02:55:05,929 --> 02:55:07,667
ORION: I Gandalf it.

2157
02:55:07,667 --> 02:55:13,210
MATT: So you turn around. You're continuing to fly
forward. So you guys just turn to push forward.

2158
02:55:13,210 --> 02:55:16,655
Tiberius, the boulder is nearly upon you now. What
are you going to do?

2159
02:55:16,655 --> 02:55:22,713
ORION: Oh! Awesome. Is it at least ten to 15 feet
away from me?

2160
02:55:22,713 --> 02:55:26,005
MATT: It is about ten to five feet away from you,
you can see it cresting--

2161
02:55:26,005 --> 02:55:32,997
ORION: Sweet. As I'm now frustrated, I cast a
5th-level spell, and I will cast my Obelisk of

2162
02:55:32,997 --> 02:55:36,613
Iron, three in a row behind me.

2163
02:55:36,613 --> 02:55:41,411
MATT: Okay. All right. You burned that spell. All
of a sudden, the room behind you, out of the

2164
02:55:41,411 --> 02:55:47,028
stone, pockets of iron ore or whatever material is
beneath the earth behind you is brought together

2165
02:55:47,028 --> 02:55:51,779
into a liquid mass and then shoots up in the
center of the hallway behind you. With each one of

2166
02:55:51,779 --> 02:55:54,713
these pillars slamming into the wall, you guys
hear these three multiple explosions behind you,

2167
02:55:54,713 --> 02:56:00,607
and for a brief second you fear the worst for
Tiberius' current status. Immediately following

2168
02:56:00,607 --> 02:56:05,943
that, you hear the impact of stone against iron,
and you see the obelisks bend with this horrible

2169
02:56:05,943 --> 02:56:07,898
creaking sound.

2170
02:56:07,898 --> 02:56:09,423
MARISHA: Keep running!

2171
02:56:09,423 --> 02:56:11,843
ORION: That should stop it right there.

2172
02:56:11,843 --> 02:56:13,324
MARISHA: I don't know.

2173
02:56:13,324 --> 02:56:16,182
MATT: The sound of the rolling has stopped.

2174
02:56:16,182 --> 02:56:20,606
MARISHA: I still don't trust it. Let's just all
get out of this hole.

2175
02:56:20,606 --> 02:56:25,899
ORION: I keep Gandalfing.

2176
02:56:25,899 --> 02:56:27,898
MARISHA: It could give way at any moment.

2177
02:56:27,898 --> 02:56:29,678
LIAM: Let's walk. Shall we walk? I think we should
walk.

2178
02:56:29,678 --> 02:56:31,259
WIL: I like to walk.

2179
02:56:31,259 --> 02:56:40,144
MATT: Okay. You guys continue moving forward, the
decline getting a little more difficult to

2180
02:56:40,144 --> 02:56:44,548
traverse as your feel yourselves now having to
feel your arms across the wall or use it for

2181
02:56:44,548 --> 02:56:49,789
balance to make sure you don't just fall. Also,
the moisture in the air begins to grow more and

2182
02:56:49,789 --> 02:56:57,287
more thick. Some source of liquid some point down
in the future has permeated what was originally

2183
02:56:57,287 --> 02:57:05,162
dusty, dry air with liquid of some kind, and the
air itself grows more and more rancid in scent. It

2184
02:57:05,162 --> 02:57:11,597
smells like refuse or rot. It's hard to describe,
and it's old. It's musky, it's terrible, and it

2185
02:57:11,597 --> 02:57:16,589
grows stronger the farther you go. As you continue
pushing forward, you also feel that the dusty

2186
02:57:16,589 --> 02:57:19,243
ground is becoming more and more mud-like.

2187
02:57:19,243 --> 02:57:22,855
WIL: Is it making my hair poof out and look
stupid?

2188
02:57:22,855 --> 02:57:27,500
MATT: A little bit, yeah. You spent all morning
treating it and it's undoing everything you did.

2189
02:57:27,500 --> 02:57:30,018
WIL: This is why I lived in the mountains.

2190
02:57:30,018 --> 02:57:35,475
WILL: Is there any light? Any light source?
There's no natural light? We're not walking

2191
02:57:35,475 --> 02:57:36,818
towards any type of light?

2192
02:57:36,818 --> 02:57:38,889
MATT: It's just a tunnel into darkness right now.

2193
02:57:38,889 --> 02:57:40,875
MARISHA: Does there appear to be any type of plant
life?

2194
02:57:40,875 --> 02:57:47,606
MATT: From what you can tell, there is no plant
life at all whatsoever. The moisture gathered on

2195
02:57:47,606 --> 02:57:53,471
the walls you can now see are dripping. The
condensation has given this tunnel more of a

2196
02:57:53,471 --> 02:57:58,109
mineral-pocketed look, and the ground is getting
more sludgy with each step.

2197
02:57:58,109 --> 02:58:01,395
WIL: I want to make a-- I'm sorry, you're not
done.

2198
02:58:01,395 --> 02:58:08,714
MARISHA: I was just going to ask: are the walls
stone or chiseled-out rock?

2199
02:58:08,714 --> 02:58:15,517
MATT: It feels like it's chiseled-out, hard earth
that has been packed and supported with either

2200
02:58:15,517 --> 02:58:21,335
small wooden things that are inset to make sure it
doesn't collapse at some point, a lot of that has

2201
02:58:21,335 --> 02:58:23,079
either fallen through.

2202
02:58:23,079 --> 02:58:25,485
WILL: So it could collapse at any time.

2203
02:58:25,485 --> 02:58:29,481
MATT: Well, if you do any severe damage to its
structure. It would probably be a bad idea.

2204
02:58:29,481 --> 02:58:31,283
MARISHA: Right, like drop a boulder down it.

2205
02:58:31,283 --> 02:58:32,830
MATT: It's not a mine shaft.

2206
02:58:32,830 --> 02:58:34,922
MARISHA: What were you going to say?

2207
02:58:34,922 --> 02:58:40,008
WIL: I would like to make a-- you tell me what
check it is. What I want to do is to look down

2208
02:58:40,008 --> 02:58:49,538
into this thick mud stuff. What I'm looking for
are tracks, and if I do well enough, I want to see

2209
02:58:49,538 --> 02:58:55,734
if I can get a sense of how fast the thing was
going. Has it slowed down because it's

2210
02:58:55,734 --> 02:58:57,623
comfortable, or is it still running?

2211
02:58:57,623 --> 02:59:00,925
MATT: Okay, make another survival check.

2212
02:59:00,925 --> 02:59:03,913
WIL: So I'm underground.

2213
02:59:03,913 --> 02:59:09,016
MATT: Actually, as a dwarf I'll give you advantage
on that, so roll again. That makes sense, this is

2214
02:59:09,016 --> 02:59:11,895
your place.

2215
02:59:11,895 --> 02:59:17,868
LIAM: Well, the higher one was four. The lower one
was a one.

2216
02:59:17,868 --> 02:59:19,908
WILL: The higher one was a four?

2217
02:59:19,908 --> 02:59:24,001
WIL: Remember what I told you about the Wheaton
dice curse? I'm sorry. Because no one will believe

2218
02:59:24,001 --> 02:59:26,887
me. No one ever believes me.

2219
02:59:26,887 --> 02:59:30,218
MARISHA: He's been taking pictures of all his
fails so everyone believes it.

2220
02:59:30,218 --> 02:59:35,992
WILL: At this point, I'd be amazed that he hasn't
helped us in any way, shape, or form, and cast a

2221
02:59:35,992 --> 02:59:37,871
perception check of my own.

2222
02:59:37,871 --> 02:59:39,023
MATT: Sure.

2223
02:59:39,023 --> 02:59:47,861
WILL: There we go. So let's see, we are at 21.

2224
02:59:47,861 --> 02:59:49,383
MATT: 21, okay.

2225
02:59:49,383 --> 02:59:52,769
WILL: You are useless. For the love of god.

2226
02:59:52,769 --> 02:59:57,041
MATT: As a pre-existing member of the Slayer's
Take and the man who was currently set to be the

2227
02:59:57,041 --> 03:00:01,938
leader of your group, you're beginning to wonder
if this guild is the kind of thing you really want

2228
03:00:01,938 --> 03:00:03,999
to be joining, at this point.

2229
03:00:03,999 --> 03:00:05,890
WIL: I haven't been in a fight yet.

2230
03:00:05,890 --> 03:00:12,884
MATT: True. But looking down you can see there are
no tracks, actually. This line has not been

2231
03:00:12,884 --> 03:00:18,939
traversed in quite some time, and the smoothness
of it says that whatever came through here did not

2232
03:00:18,939 --> 03:00:20,404
leave any footprints.

2233
03:00:20,404 --> 03:00:21,364
WILL: At all?

2234
03:00:21,364 --> 03:00:26,855
MATT: No. Also, as you guys continue, you reach a
point where, especially with your heavy armor-- go

2235
03:00:26,855 --> 03:00:29,034
ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.

2236
03:00:29,034 --> 03:00:30,488
MARISHA: Oh no.

2237
03:00:30,488 --> 03:00:31,893
LIAM: You got this.

2238
03:00:31,893 --> 03:00:34,230
WILL: Ten. So wait. 13.

2239
03:00:34,230 --> 03:00:42,341
MATT: 13? Okay. You're stepping forward, keeping
an eye out, and you look back at the group and

2240
03:00:42,341 --> 03:00:50,148
take a step and your foot slips out from under
you. (smack) You hit the slime and begin to slide

2241
03:00:50,148 --> 03:00:57,017
down the tunnel as part of the decline. You guys
watch as your cleric Goonies-style slide vanishes

2242
03:00:57,017 --> 03:00:58,393
into the darkness.

2243
03:00:58,393 --> 03:01:00,178
WILL: It's our time. It's our time down here.

2244
03:01:00,178 --> 03:01:02,535
WIL: Hey, you guys!

2245
03:01:02,535 --> 03:01:09,072
MATT: Kashaw has vanished into the darkness and
you hear, (screams).

2246
03:01:09,072 --> 03:01:11,147
WILL: (screams)

2247
03:01:11,147 --> 03:01:15,737
ORION: As I see this happening, I run over and go
like, this looks like a lot of fun!

2248
03:01:15,737 --> 03:01:17,636
MATT: As you lunge through the air, because you're
flying, still.

2249
03:01:17,636 --> 03:01:22,728
ORION: Oh. Has ten minutes passed? I thought ten
minutes? It only lasts for like ten minutes.

2250
03:01:22,728 --> 03:01:25,779
MATT: Oh, then yeah, it's faded. So you just slide
after?

2251
03:01:25,779 --> 03:01:28,519
ORION: Yeah, I go, this looks like a lot of fun.
And I go and I slide.

2252
03:01:28,519 --> 03:01:31,294
MATT: Tiberius slides after, body first across the
slime.

2253
03:01:31,294 --> 03:01:35,134
MARISHA: And then I see Tiberius go and I go,
(whoops). And I go, too.

2254
03:01:35,134 --> 03:01:40,014
MATT: All right. Three of your party have just
vanished into the darkness, hoping that fate will

2255
03:01:40,014 --> 03:01:42,396
take them to some place of pillows and feathers.

2256
03:01:42,396 --> 03:01:45,304
LIAM: I think I'd rather walk as long as I can.

2257
03:01:45,304 --> 03:01:46,995
WIL: I think I'm with you.

2258
03:01:46,995 --> 03:01:56,706
MATT: All right. You guys both make dexterity
saving throws.

2259
03:01:56,706 --> 03:02:00,594
WIL: 16.

2260
03:02:00,594 --> 03:02:02,293
LIAM: 16.

2261
03:02:02,293 --> 03:02:07,205
MATT: Wow. You manage to slowly make your way down
this tunnel, almost-- what's that?

2262
03:02:07,205 --> 03:02:09,158
ORION: My dex was 18, by the way.

2263
03:02:09,158 --> 03:02:13,119
MATT: It doesn't matter; you jumped into this. You
intentionally fell.

2264
03:02:13,119 --> 03:02:15,975
LIAM: We can't even hear you anymore. You're miles
away.

2265
03:02:15,975 --> 03:02:18,498
MATT: Yeah. You guys slowly begin to make your way
down the tunnel, as you can't even hear them

2266
03:02:18,498 --> 03:02:22,849
anymore. You guys, one after another, sliding down
the slide and grime going past you. You smell in

2267
03:02:22,849 --> 03:02:30,031
the air what smells like vegetable matter that's
been long, long falling in compost, along with

2268
03:02:30,031 --> 03:02:38,049
what smells like rancid feces mixed with mold.
It's this terrible continuously growing scent.

2269
03:02:38,049 --> 03:02:40,620
ORION: I put up my nose scales.

2270
03:02:40,620 --> 03:02:45,365
MATT: Until eventually, out of the darkness,
because you're ahead of everyone, you're outside

2271
03:02:45,365 --> 03:02:49,367
of the range of his Light spell, the slime stops
and there's just air.

2272
03:02:49,367 --> 03:02:52,276
LIAM: Hey, you guys!

2273
03:02:52,276 --> 03:03:04,614
MATT: And a few moments of this air rushing past
you as you're immediately stopped with a wet sound

2274
03:03:04,614 --> 03:03:13,816
as you impact hard into some sort of heavy spongy
matter. Thankfully, because it's spongy, you only

2275
03:03:13,816 --> 03:03:19,675
suffer four points of damage, so you can mark that
somewhere on the sheet. Mainly just from the way

2276
03:03:19,675 --> 03:03:24,456
you landed and your armor sticks into where the
plates are and just the impact was bad for your

2277
03:03:24,456 --> 03:03:30,516
body. But you're now in darkness, looking up,
sitting on what feels like you're on some sort of

2278
03:03:30,516 --> 03:03:35,293
strange compost heap. Looking up, you see in the
darkness this small light begin to appear, and you

2279
03:03:35,293 --> 03:03:37,855
see this dragonborn--

2280
03:03:37,855 --> 03:03:40,040
ORION: I'm laughing, by the way.

2281
03:03:40,040 --> 03:03:42,601
WILL: Can I try to move, since I hear him
laughing, can I try to move out of the way?

2282
03:03:42,601 --> 03:03:47,097
MATT: You roll out of the way as the two of you
scream down. With the light that now shines you

2283
03:03:47,097 --> 03:03:51,277
can see this is a cylindrical cistern of some
kind. It is a tunnel that is very tall, and you

2284
03:03:51,277 --> 03:03:55,040
both impact into the same heap.

2285
03:03:55,040 --> 03:03:57,739
LIAM: Shitter's full!

2286
03:03:57,739 --> 03:04:07,656
ORION: As we land, I look around. Oh, that was a
lot of fun. I cast Prestidigitation three times in

2287
03:04:07,656 --> 03:04:09,187
a row and clean us all up.

2288
03:04:09,187 --> 03:04:14,270
MATT: You try and clean what you can, but you guys
are like knee to nearly waist deep as you get up

2289
03:04:14,270 --> 03:04:15,357
and move around--

2290
03:04:15,357 --> 03:04:16,671
ORION: Or at least our faces.

2291
03:04:16,671 --> 03:04:18,038
MATT: Your faces are clean.

2292
03:04:18,038 --> 03:04:19,852
WILL: What a wonderful smell you've discovered.

2293
03:04:19,852 --> 03:04:25,197
MATT: And it's a terrible smell. This room is
quite honestly a mixture of long-rotting food, of

2294
03:04:25,197 --> 03:04:30,180
dried vegetation that has been discarded here for
whatever reason, a lot of it's hay and thatch that

2295
03:04:30,180 --> 03:04:36,881
has been just rotting and molding for god knows
how many years, and quite honestly, feces from

2296
03:04:36,881 --> 03:04:38,651
some indeterminate entity.

2297
03:04:38,651 --> 03:04:45,742
MARISHA: I use my Druidcraft to take out some of
my sage and light it

2298
03:04:45,742 --> 03:04:49,038
and spread some of my sage around.

2299
03:04:49,038 --> 03:04:57,457
ORION: You're making it worse. Now it's smoky and
smells. Prestidigitate it out of my face.

2300
03:04:57,457 --> 03:05:01,332
MATT: As you guys are doing this, you guys are
making your way down the tunnel. And you have a

2301
03:05:01,332 --> 03:05:08,248
ways to catch up to them, you do hear (squeaking).
You hear this, and as you look around with the

2302
03:05:08,248 --> 03:05:12,928
light you can see little bits of movement leaping
through this heap.

2303
03:05:12,928 --> 03:05:15,585
LIAM: Rat horde.

2304
03:05:15,585 --> 03:05:17,952
WILL: Rats are going to be wonderful.

2305
03:05:17,952 --> 03:05:25,271
MATT: Then suddenly, thrusting out of some of this
heap, you see a large arm or tendril, brownish-tan

2306
03:05:25,271 --> 03:05:29,212
in color just slams onto the side of it.

2307
03:05:29,212 --> 03:05:32,449
ORION: Oh shit. I go invisible.

2308
03:05:32,449 --> 03:05:36,990
WILL: You've got to help-- where the hell did he
go?

2309
03:05:36,990 --> 03:05:41,057
MATT: At which point you now see emerging from it
two of these giant tendrils, which at the end are

2310
03:05:41,057 --> 03:05:47,197
covered in these long, teeth-like spines, grasping
the sides of this stone cylinder, pulling itself

2311
03:05:47,197 --> 03:05:51,088
out of the refuse, shaking as it pulls itself
forward. You now see the body that contains it

2312
03:05:51,088 --> 03:05:56,312
with one third central tendril that rises up, what
looks like creepy eyes or nose-holes that are

2313
03:05:56,312 --> 03:06:01,923
looking around and glancing at both of you, and
you see emerging beneath that the body, this

2314
03:06:01,923 --> 03:06:09,706
large, eight- to ten-foot-thick, wide,
covered-in-slime body that is this gargantuan

2315
03:06:09,821 --> 03:06:16,669
toothy maw that opens up with a tongue that lolls
out. And that's where we're going to go ahead and

2316
03:06:16,669 --> 03:06:25,493
end today's session. We'll pick it up next week
right where we left off. You guys slowly making

2317
03:06:25,493 --> 03:06:27,716
your way down the tunnel. We'll pick up with that
next time.

2318
03:06:27,716 --> 03:06:31,056
WILL: Toothy maw is where we end it!

2319
03:06:31,056 --> 03:06:33,377
MATT: Yep. Toothy maw.

2320
03:06:33,377 --> 03:06:36,381
MARISHA: Tentacley, brown, twitchy eyeball, toothy
maw. That's all we know?

2321
03:06:36,381 --> 03:06:41,117
MATT: That's all you know. And some sort of
strange sound and other small things moving.

2322
03:06:41,117 --> 03:06:43,309
WIL: Do you give out prizes for the most ones
rolled in a night,

2323
03:06:43,309 --> 03:06:45,175
because I'm pretty sure I won that.

2324
03:06:45,175 --> 03:06:48,466
MATT: I do, and for that prize I give you a fancy
yellow d20.

2325
03:06:48,466 --> 03:06:55,588
WIL: Oh! Thank you. That's great. Does it have all
ones on it?

2326
03:06:55,588 --> 03:06:59,575
MATT: Shit. Yeah. How did that happen?

2327
03:06:59,575 --> 03:07:02,161
MARISHA: Oh, that's been your problem the whole
time.

2328
03:07:02,161 --> 03:07:05,093
LIAM: Congratulations, you've won imploding
self-esteem.

2329
03:07:05,093 --> 03:07:15,267
WIL: That stacks, right? I already have that. I
mean, it would be silly if I couldn't-- is that an

2330
03:07:15,267 --> 03:07:20,435
ongoing? Because that's a feat I took when I
started.

2331
03:07:20,435 --> 03:07:23,931
MATT: Yeah, yeah, I tried to tell you not to take
that but, you know, character flavor is

2332
03:07:23,931 --> 03:07:25,234
important.

2333
03:07:25,234 --> 03:07:28,946
WIL: Listen, it's a class feature. It's an actor's
class feature.

2334
03:07:28,946 --> 03:07:31,766
LIAM: After enough time, you can suck people into
it.

2335
03:07:31,766 --> 03:07:39,211
MATT: Well, guys, thank you so much!

2336
03:07:39,211 --> 03:07:41,412
WIL: Thanks, Matt. That was amazing.

2337
03:07:41,412 --> 03:07:44,477
MATT: That was a fun first round. Got one more
session with you guys.

2338
03:07:44,477 --> 03:07:46,504
MARISHA: Yes, and what did you think of your first
game?

2339
03:07:46,504 --> 03:07:50,576
WILL: It was incredible, nothing should be this
fun. Seriously, it was so much fun.

2340
03:07:50,576 --> 03:07:52,192
Yeah. Awesome.

2341
03:07:52,192 --> 03:07:56,442
MATT: Well guys, thank you, I'm so glad you could
join us and I'm excited for next week. And thank

2342
03:07:56,442 --> 03:08:01,549

much as we are. We can't stay too long,

2343
03:08:01,549 --> 03:08:06,822
unfortunately, I have a flight to catch very soon
to fly out to a convention in Columbus, Ohio. Zac,

business we've got to get down to with all you

2346

2347
03:08:16,123 --> 03:08:19,609
MATT: We'll have to save gifts for next week when
we're not quite in such a huge rush, so for those

2348
03:08:19,609 --> 03:08:24,582
of you who sent stuff, we'll get into those next

2381
03:11:55,722 --> 03:11:58,776
amazing charity and we love all the people at
826.

2382
03:11:58,776 --> 03:12:03,389
MARISHA: We're going to be doing a video very soon
going to 826 and telling you guys all about it.

2383
03:12:03,389 --> 03:12:05,614
But yes, they're a great charity, so yes.

2384
03:12:05,614 --> 03:12:10,167
MATT: Give to them the hefty amount that you guys
have contributed over this time towards their

2385
03:12:10,167 --> 03:12:11,727
charity. It's fascinating.

2386
03:12:11,727 --> 03:12:16,476
WILL: You guys have incredible fans. This whole
week leading up to this on Twitter and everything,

03:12:16,476 --> 03:12:18,565
you guys have amazing fans.

MARISHA: Now you guys get the fanart!

2389
03:12:20,666 --> 03:12:21,879

2390
03:12:21,879 --> 03:12:24,185
MATT: Sorry about the DDOS attack. That's how we
say hi.

2391
03:12:24,185 --> 03:12:25,784
WILL: No, seriously, it's amazing.

2392
03:12:25,784 --> 03:12:27,731
ZAC: Don't even mention things like that. Don't
mention those things.

2393
03:12:27,731 --> 03:12:32,548
WIL: It's more of a hug.

2394
03:12:32,548 --> 03:12:38,941
ZAC: Thank you everybody for helping us get to 6k.
They've already started a stupid e-mail chain

2395
03:12:38,941 --> 03:12:41,376
talking about what musical songs they're going to
sing.

2396
03:12:41,376 --> 03:12:47,586
MARISHA: That's amazing. Oh, and guys, Mary
Elizabeth came back to visit and watch.

2397
03:12:47,586 --> 03:12:52,023
So she did return.

2398
03:12:52,023 --> 03:12:54,462
MARY: Hi!

2399
03:12:54,462 --> 03:12:56,366
MARISHA: She's back!

2400
03:12:56,366 --> 03:12:58,196
MARY: And a special guest.

2401
03:12:58,196 --> 03:13:01,074
STEVE: I'm just going to troll. Hi.

2402
03:13:01,074 --> 03:13:03,297
MARISHA: Steven Blum, everybody.

2403
03:13:03,297 --> 03:13:04,859
WILL: Starscream himself is here.

2404
03:13:04,859 --> 03:13:06,900
MARISHA: Yes, he is.

2405
03:13:06,900 --> 03:13:16,118
MATT: Thank you so much for coming to watch, I
hope you enjoyed yourselves. Yeah, it's an

2406
03:13:16,118 --> 03:13:19,125
incredible time, looking forward to the session
next week. Are there any other closing comments

2407
03:13:19,125 --> 03:13:20,997
you guys want to bust out tonight?

2408
03:13:20,997 --> 03:13:22,913
MARISHA: I don't want to wait a week.

2409
03:13:22,913 --> 03:13:30,741
WIL: Really fun and really weird to be on this
side of that screen. So odd for me, and just to

2410
03:13:30,741 --> 03:13:36,530
play a character who's so different from the
characters I used to play before I DMed all the

2411
03:13:36,530 --> 03:13:42,167
time. It's weird to be a guy who just doesn't
think about stuff and like is not particularly

2412
03:13:42,167 --> 03:13:51,138
charismatic and anyway, people who have thought
about playing or want to play RPGs, when we were

2413
03:13:51,138 --> 03:13:55,786
rolling up this guy, I was so excited when I got--
what did I roll for him? Anyway he's got a minus

2414
03:13:55,786 --> 03:14:01,780
one. I rolled an eight for his charisma, and I was
so excited because I was like, well now I know

2415
03:14:01,780 --> 03:14:07,504
exactly who this guy is. I know exactly who he is
and it's going to be really fun to be him. It was

2416
03:14:07,504 --> 03:14:12,382
really great, it was really fun to come and I
found out about your game because Liam directed me

2417
03:14:12,382 --> 03:14:17,136
in a voice session. I want to be on your show so
much.

2418
03:14:17,136 --> 03:14:22,061
MATT: Well, now it is done. Dreams do come true.
Then we smash them.

2419
03:14:22,061 --> 03:14:25,185
WILL: Now roll a one and get us out of here.

2420
03:14:25,185 --> 03:14:31,219
WIL: I'll try, but since it's not going to count,
I don't know.

2421
03:14:31,219 --> 03:14:32,821
LIAM: It'll be a 20. 19.

2422
03:14:32,821 --> 03:14:36,076
(laughter)

2423
03:14:36,076 --> 03:14:42,501
MATT: Thanks so much. We'll see you next week, 7PM
on the Twitch stream. Have a wonderful week.

2424
03:14:42,501 --> 03:14:44,776
MARISHA: Bye!
