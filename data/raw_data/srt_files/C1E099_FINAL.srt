1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:04,186
MATT: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

2
00:00:04,186 --> 00:00:11,802
sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. For our
99th episode, which is crazy, that's absolute

3
00:00:11,802 --> 00:00:17,617
batshit. Makes next week the 100th, which is
crazy, even more crazy, and we'll be more crazy.

4
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:21,155
TRAVIS: You did the math wrong there. Oh no,
that's right.

5
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:27,262
MATT: Yeah, that's right. Yeah, intelligence six.
Anyway, guys, welcome! We have an awesome guest.

6
00:00:27,262 --> 00:00:28,903
Tonight Jon Heder will be joining us--

7
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:31,575
(cheering)

8
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:33,047
ASHLEY: Who is it? Who is it?

9
00:00:33,047 --> 00:00:37,274
MATT: -- at the point in the narrative in which
his character will arrive. But, before then, let's

10
00:00:37,274 --> 00:00:42,066
go ahead and get to our announcements for the
evening. First and foremost, we have a new merch

11
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:43,458
item, I believe.

12
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:44,578
LAURA: Yes, we do!

13
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,210
MATT: Laura, if you want to introduce it and
possibly--

14
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,443
LAURA: Oh, well I know some of you have been
wanting to hear more about Scanlan, and we thought

15
00:00:51,443 --> 00:00:56,135
it would be great to release a concert tee of his.
Wait, turn around,

16
00:00:56,135 --> 00:00:58,240
because it's even better on the back.

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,259
(cheering)

18
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:06,208
LAURA: And if you notice, he's got a few canceled
appearances there at the end because--

19
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,872
SAM: Because he died.

20
00:01:07,872 --> 00:01:09,569
TRAVIS: Because he's a traitorous bitch.

21
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:15,002
LAURA: Yeah, and it's pretty cool, so there's
that. And that's in the store right now!

22
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:16,148
Go check it out.

23
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:17,494
MARISHA: Oh my god, right now.

24
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,976
TRAVIS: Enter the Meat Man.

25
00:01:18,976 --> 00:01:21,505
SAM: If we can't have Scanlan, at least we've got
the shirt.

26
00:01:21,505 --> 00:01:23,330
LAURA: That's right. That's right.

27
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,628
LIAM: And good memories.

28
00:01:24,628 --> 00:01:27,128
(laughter)

29
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:30,369
LAURA: Maybe, maybe we'll see Scanlan in concert
sometime.

30
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:34,383
MARISHA: And we'll be like, "We used to hang out
with him before he was famous."

31
00:01:34,383 --> 00:01:38,535
LAURA: Yeah, before he was famous. Marisha, you've
got a little food on your mouth.

32
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:43,661
Under your lip. You got it.

33
00:01:43,661 --> 00:01:46,613
SAM: Announcements continue!

34
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:53,403
MATT: Yes, so anyway, other things. The campaign
guide, the Tal'Dorei campaign guide, info is up on

35
00:01:53,403 --> 00:01:57,403
the Green Ronin website. If you're looking for it,
they have dates of release, price points, and

36
00:01:57,403 --> 00:02:01,405
where you can find it and when. So if you go to
the Green Ronin website, Google search for Green

37
00:02:01,405 --> 00:02:05,708
Ronin, they have a section there for the front
page that has all the updates, or you can look at

38
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:10,613
@GreenRoninPub on twitter. They have the updates
there as well. I also retweeted it on my twitter

39
00:02:10,613 --> 00:02:17,072
so you can find it there. But that should answer
your questions. We've gotten a bunch today. Also,

40
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:21,479
tomorrow and Saturday, up in Seattle, the actual
folks at Dungeons & Dragons are doing the Stream

41
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:25,486
of Annihilation, in which they're having a bunch
of people from the community coming out there to

42
00:02:25,486 --> 00:02:31,036
play games together, mix it up, be crazy, and
unveil their new story setting which I'm really

43
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:36,067
excited for you guys to find out about. But as
part of that, Marisha, Taliesin, Liam, and myself

44
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:40,098
will be going up there and playing some games.
I'll be running a game on Saturday morning with

45
00:02:40,098 --> 00:02:47,066
the Guts, Girls, Glory group. And that is going to
be a lot of fun. So you should come watch. Find

46
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:51,205
the information at the official Dungeons and
Dragons twitter, and we'll look forward to seeing

47
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:54,019
you guys over the next couple of days up there as
well.

48
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:56,270
LAURA: I'll be in Las Vegas this weekend for--

49
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,513
LIAM: Gambling?

50
00:02:57,513 --> 00:02:59,640
LAURA: No, for Gears of War event.

51
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,097
ALL: Ooh!

52
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:06,417
LAURA: So if you guys play Gears of War
competitively, come out and fight and then see me

53
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:07,876
while I'm there.

54
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:10,106
TRAVIS: Are you going to play competitive Gears of
War?

55
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,123
LAURA: No, but I'm going to cheer people on,
though, real good.

56
00:03:12,123 --> 00:03:14,169
(laughter)

57
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:21,077
MATT: Well, cool, awesome! Also, next weekend, not
this, but the weekend after that, I'll be at A-Kon

58
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:23,161
June 8-11 in Fort Worth, Texas.

59
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,087
TRAVIS: I went to college there.

60
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:27,212
MATT: Yeah, Travis went to college there.

61
00:03:27,212 --> 00:03:30,911
MATT: Also, wanted to let you guys know that there is
a charity banquet event happening at the event,

62
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:35,803
which is going to be a two- to three-hour dinner,
meal provided. Hang out. I'll be a part of that.

63
00:03:35,803 --> 00:03:39,084
You can come actually talk to me in person.
One of the few guaranteed ways I'll have an

64
00:03:39,084 --> 00:03:43,746
opportunity to interface with people, so you don't
have to wait in line for it necessarily. It's an

65
00:03:43,746 --> 00:03:49,109
add-on to your con ticket, and if you're there,
the proceeds of that ticket all go to the Texas

66
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:53,541
Scottish Rite Hospital. So it's a cool event,
happy to support an awesome charity, and hopefully

67
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:58,319
get to see some of you guys there. Wednesday Club,
Taliesin, what you got coming up?

68
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,967
TALIESIN: We're talking about the Young Avengers
this next week. We just finished Wonder Woman; it

69
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:06,927
was a great time. We wore tiaras and capes and
talked.

70
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:08,097
MARISHA: Did you really?

71
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:10,545
TALIESIN: Matt wore the cape and I wore the tiara.
It was really good.

72
00:04:10,545 --> 00:04:12,089
SAM: The Young Avengers?

73
00:04:12,089 --> 00:04:13,925
TALIESIN: We're going to be talking about the
Young Avengers which are--

74
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:15,575
SAM: Kid Hulk, Kid Iron Man.

75
00:04:15,575 --> 00:04:25,165
TALIESIN: You are-- Hulkling. And Iron Lad. But
we're going to be talking about the teenage

76
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:28,891
superheroes of the Marvel U, specifically the ones
who take the Avengers name, and they're really

77
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:33,356
fun and the modern take on them is really going to
be influencing a lot of the stuff that ends up on

78
00:04:33,408 --> 00:04:36,165
TV and it's going to be a lot of fun. They're some
of my favorite books; they're badass.

79
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:40,732
MATT: Awesome, thank you, Taliesin. Check out
Wednesday Club. And of course we have Talks

80
00:04:40,732 --> 00:04:45,983
Machina live on Tuesday next week, about this
episode you're gonna see tonight, at 7PM Pacific Time here

81
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:48,916
on Twitch and Alpha, hosted by our fantastic Brian
Wayne Foster.

82
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:51,341
ALL: Brian Wayne Foster!

83
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:53,544
MATT: Yes, so check it out, then.

84
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:55,209
LAURA: I've got one.

85
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:56,362
MATT: What you got?

86
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,564
LAURA: I didn't put it on the list.

87
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:58,618
MATT: No, you didn't.

88
00:04:58,618 --> 00:05:00,325
LAURA: But it's a present for Liam O'Brien.

89
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:01,661
(cheering)

90
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:03,848
LAURA: I didn't get to give him his birthday
present last week, and now I do get to.

91
00:05:03,848 --> 00:05:05,682
LIAM: (shrieks)

92
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:07,830
MARISHA: I just remembered it was your birthday.

93
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,822
LIAM: Oh my goodness.

94
00:05:09,822 --> 00:05:11,874
LAURA: I wrapped it all pretty, open it up.

95
00:05:11,874 --> 00:05:14,702
LIAM: Okay, with a thank-you in advance and
afterwards as well.

96
00:05:14,702 --> 00:05:16,958
LAURA: Open it up!

97
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:21,861
LIAM: We'll edit this part out, right? I just
meant the unwrapping.

98
00:05:21,861 --> 00:05:23,273
SAM: It's a ring box.

99
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:24,697
TRAVIS: Please be a turd.

100
00:05:24,697 --> 00:05:27,665
LAURA: It's just a pile of blue poop.

101
00:05:27,665 --> 00:05:32,351
LIAM: Oh. Oh my god.

102
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:33,916
LAURA: Did you see it?

103
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:42,793
LIAM: Yes. Not big enough. It's a-- aw, man-- it's
beautiful.

104
00:05:42,793 --> 00:05:43,928
TRAVIS: What is it?

105
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:48,773
LIAM: It's a ring and it's got raven feathers on
it and a little black gem. And on the inside it

106
00:05:48,773 --> 00:05:50,550
says, "Do not go far from me."

107
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,294
TRAVIS: Aw! Wow, twinsies.

108
00:05:53,294 --> 00:05:56,474
LIAM: Thank you.

109
00:05:56,474 --> 00:06:00,251
LAURA: You're welcome. I don't know if it will fit
you, but you know, happy birthday.

110
00:06:00,251 --> 00:06:03,805
SAM: Is it a genuine gold-style ring?

111
00:06:03,805 --> 00:06:05,054
LAURA: Did it fit?

112
00:06:05,054 --> 00:06:06,072
LIAM: It fit.

113
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:08,348
LAURA: I guessed it! Yes!

114
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:17,549
LIAM: It is beautiful. I love it so much. Perfect.
Love it. That's a great birthday present.

115
00:06:17,549 --> 00:06:18,824
LAURA: Well, all right.

116
00:06:18,824 --> 00:06:27,577
MATT: That's really awesome. Happy birthday. Both
of you guys after the fact. Yay. All right, then.

117
00:06:27,577 --> 00:06:33,775
Unless anyone has anything else? Let's go ahead
and dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

118
00:06:33,775 --> 00:08:04,378
[dramatic music]

119
00:08:04,378 --> 00:08:11,789
MATT: Hello, and welcome back. So, where we last
left off, Vox Machina had discovered that one of

120
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:16,492
their companions, the most recent addition to their
team, Taryon Darrington, had gone missing,

121
00:08:16,492 --> 00:08:23,170
seemingly taken by a bounty hunter who had
masqueraded as a pastry chef and was retrieving

122
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:30,327
him to be returned to Wildmount within the city of
Deastok to the rest of the Darrington family. Upon

123
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:36,518
heading them off the pass and retrieving Taryon,
you all made your way to Deastok and spoke with

124
00:08:36,518 --> 00:08:41,813
the rest of the Taryon Darrington family and
discovered, it seems, that they have gone into

125
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:49,500
serious debt. There's been a long-running
agreement between the Darringtons and a criminal

126
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,814
syndicate known as the Myriad that seems to be
very prominent in Wildmount. And as the years have

127
00:08:54,814 --> 00:08:58,686
gone by, that debt has compounded and compounded
to the point where they were threatening to

128
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:04,944
take everything from the Darrington family and
toss them onto the street. Your father, Howaardt,

129
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:11,127
told you that his plan to prevent this from
happening was to marry you off to a very rich and

130
00:09:11,127 --> 00:09:19,651
powerful family up in the capital in the kingdom,
and you decided to look for other options. You

131
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:25,495
went and spoke with a gentleman named Korshad who
was within a secret bar beneath the Grumpy Lily

132
00:09:25,495 --> 00:09:32,525
tavern where a bunch of, it seems, Myriad and
other lowlives go to drink, be merry, and go about

133
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:38,895
their business in a safer environment. You seemed
to talk with him about a possibility of making

134
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:44,475
some sort of arrangement, and an accord was made
where if you went and cleansed a nearby platinum

135
00:09:44,475 --> 00:09:50,776
mine of Herethis, that had seemingly been overrun
with some sort of awoken entity that had prevented

136
00:09:50,776 --> 00:09:55,283
them from mining the platinum, and are losing a
lot of money-- if you were to destroy this

137
00:09:55,283 --> 00:10:00,368
creature or cleanse the mines of the threats to
it, they would forgive some of the debt. They

138
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:03,691
would still take the lands from the Darrington
family, but they would leave the estate, they

139
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:09,415
would leave whatever remains on that land, and
would not mess with them any further, thus ending

140
00:10:09,415 --> 00:10:14,718
the contract and still leaving a comfortable
lifestyle for the family. You agreed to this, made

141
00:10:14,718 --> 00:10:19,922
your way to the Herathis platinum mines, delved
deep into the open sinkhole that seemed to consume

142
00:10:19,922 --> 00:10:26,092
a portion of its construct, and discovered what
had awoken within, a strange, once-seeded

143
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:31,913
celestial that had been awoken too early and too
young. As such, its weird, angelic, baby-like

144
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:37,928
form had withered and twisted, and in battling the
celestial, which manipulated the terrain around

145
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:41,663
you, you managed to defeat it and destroy it
before it could escape, gathered some of its

146
00:10:41,663 --> 00:10:50,073
remaining glittery ashes, if you will, and
proceeded to fly up through the sinkhole as the

147
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:55,477
rest of the ankheg swarm that seemed to parade
through the tunnels within began to swarm up the

148
00:10:55,477 --> 00:11:01,550
sides and spit acid at you as you escaped out the
top. Into the moonlit sky looking down below,

149
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:07,057
you could see the swarm now crawling up and out of
the maw of this mine, and that's where we left

150
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:15,945
off. So as you've all just emerged out of the
central portion of the mine, taking a deep breath

151
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:20,814
as you're now suddenly out of the immediate
danger, you can look down and see the dozens of

152
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:26,919
large insectoid-like ankhegs now clambering up to
the top on the edge, some of them seemingly

153
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:33,148
shooting jets of acid too far away to make any
impact, but they are intent definitely on trying

154
00:11:33,148 --> 00:11:38,898
to either shoo you off of their territory or hit
at some sort of lucky impact.

155
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,041
What do you guys want to do?

156
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:47,727
SAM: I, Taryon Darrington, would like to call to
the rest of the gang and say:

157
00:11:47,727 --> 00:11:51,850
Wait, before we fly away, hold.

158
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,277
TALIESIN: Superman.

159
00:11:55,277 --> 00:11:59,011
SAM: Oh, okay. Thought it was some sort of power
move.

160
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:02,726
LAURA: How are we positioned, again?

161
00:12:02,726 --> 00:12:09,441
MATT: So you have the broom riders. You have
Percival on your broom. You're flying with your

162
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:12,136
wings. And everyone else is on the carpet.

163
00:12:12,136 --> 00:12:13,371
LAURA: Okay.

164
00:12:13,371 --> 00:12:21,930
SAM: I would like to just sort of shout to my
friends. Oi, can we, just before we go, could we

165
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:31,686
maybe just swoop down one more time? Just a quick
flyby. I have an idea. I feel like we need just an

166
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:37,470
insurance policy when we go talk to the Myriad
fellow. I was wondering if Kiki here could maybe

167
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,239
throw a spell down before we leave? Is that
something?

168
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:42,009
TRAVIS: You just go down by yourself, right?

169
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:43,381
LAURA: Do you have any spells left?

170
00:12:43,381 --> 00:12:45,691
MARISHA: I do still have some spells left. It
depends on what you want to do, though, and what I

171
00:12:45,691 --> 00:12:46,631
have prepared.

172
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:53,820
SAM: Well here's a question: can you make it look
like the mouth of the cave isn't there anymore?

173
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,421
Has caved in or is covered in dirt or rocks or
something?

174
00:12:58,421 --> 00:13:04,436
MARISHA: I can. I have a few options for that.

175
00:13:04,436 --> 00:13:06,564
LAURA: Why do you want that?

176
00:13:06,564 --> 00:13:15,434
SAM: As I said, I feel like when we talk to the
Myriad fellow-- oh wait, let me fly over to you.

177
00:13:15,434 --> 00:13:18,058
(laughter)

178
00:13:18,058 --> 00:13:22,825
SAM: I feel like when we talk to the Myriad
fellow, we have lost our bargaining position at

179
00:13:22,825 --> 00:13:28,818
this point, because we did what he asked. But if
we hide the mouth of the cave from him, then we

180
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:33,955
have information that he needs, like where did it
go, how do you get in, that kind of thing. I was

181
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:40,993
also hoping maybe dear Pike could leave some sort
of a trap, again as just an insurance policy.

182
00:13:40,993 --> 00:13:42,693
ASHLEY: Like a glyph situation?

183
00:13:42,693 --> 00:13:47,167
SAM: Yes, some sort of a thing that would explode
when someone comes by. But I know it's crawling

184
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:50,904
with characters down there, so I don't-- should we
wait? I don't know.

185
00:13:50,904 --> 00:13:52,535
ASHLEY: I could do such a thing.

186
00:13:52,535 --> 00:13:57,033
MARISHA: I can do a Hallucinatory Terrain, which I
could do right now because I do have it learned.

187
00:13:57,033 --> 00:14:04,532
It covers a 150-foot cube, which I don't know--
How wide is the hole?

188
00:14:04,532 --> 00:14:11,990
MATT: Is it a 150-foot cube? That would cover
pretty much the sinkhole itself. Do keep in mind

189
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,620
the agreement was to cleanse the mine, not just of
the creature but of the infestation.

190
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,741
LAURA: Oh, we have to kill all the fuckers?

191
00:14:19,741 --> 00:14:24,346
MATT: Or at least enough to the point where the
infestation is no longer an issue.

192
00:14:24,346 --> 00:14:27,934
TRAVIS: Tary, can you tinker up some Raid real
quick?

193
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:31,472
SAM: I cannot. Wait, we have to kill more of these
fuckers?

194
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:34,597
LAURA: Maybe we just get high enough that they
can't get to us with the acid, and then we just

195
00:14:34,597 --> 00:14:36,980
fire things down at them.

196
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,443
LIAM: Roughly speaking, how many of those did we
see when we came up?

197
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,832
MATT: You saw probably close to a hundred. There
were a few that you destroyed on the way up, or

198
00:14:44,832 --> 00:14:51,210
some that got wrecked. But you probably have
somewhere in the neighborhood of I'd say anywhere from

199
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:55,194
60 to 70 that are now visibly coming up the wall.
You can see in the moonlight--

200
00:14:55,236 --> 00:14:56,758
you can see the walls moving.

201
00:14:56,758 --> 00:15:02,662
MARISHA: Well, we can if we gather them in one
place. Are they attracted to anything like shiny

202
00:15:02,662 --> 00:15:04,252
things or movement?

203
00:15:04,252 --> 00:15:05,620
TRAVIS: We need bait.

204
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,594
TALIESIN: Us.

205
00:15:06,594 --> 00:15:12,684
MATT: You're not sure. They seem to have been
drawn by the sounds and the movement of the combat

206
00:15:12,684 --> 00:15:17,184
you had at the bottom of the cavern. It took them
long enough for the battle you had to get down

207
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:23,646
there, and now they're skittering back up the wall
as you guys, with your torchlight, are making your

208
00:15:23,646 --> 00:15:25,031
way up towards the bank

209
00:15:25,031 --> 00:15:27,676
TALIESIN: I might just start shooting there if
they keep coming.

210
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:31,411
LIAM: T.D., do you have anything that lets you
teleport us all?

211
00:15:31,411 --> 00:15:38,487
SAM: No. Not really. I can become invisible and
fly down there.

212
00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:43,260
TALIESIN: Do you have any good terrain modifier
something to trash them?

213
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:57,203
MARISHA: So they're attracted to movement and
sound. Percy, you have a very loud banging thing.

214
00:15:57,203 --> 00:15:58,090
TALIESIN: I do.

215
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,675
MARISHA: If we can get them all clumped together,
I can throw down a few Fireballs and Flaming

216
00:16:01,675 --> 00:16:05,918
Spheres and probably take a lot of them out. But I
need them clumped together.

217
00:16:05,918 --> 00:16:14,171
TALIESIN: What do we have that's dead in the Bag
of Holding right now? Let's just start throwing

218
00:16:14,171 --> 00:16:17,352
them down some things to eat and I'm going to
start making some noise.

219
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:18,884
MARISHA: Are they still on the walls?

220
00:16:18,884 --> 00:16:22,596
MATT: You can see a lot of them are still making
their way towards the mouth of the cavern. There's

221
00:16:22,596 --> 00:16:26,263
probably about 25 or so that are gathered around
the outside. Some of them are spreading a little

222
00:16:26,263 --> 00:16:29,883
bit out, trying to get towards where you are on
the edges of the hole. If you wanted to move

223
00:16:29,883 --> 00:16:31,688
towards the top, you might draw them towards the
edge.

224
00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:34,424
TALIESIN: Let's fly above it and I'll take a few
shots and we'll just start dropping things down.

225
00:16:34,424 --> 00:16:41,570
LIAM: One other idea. What if I go in as bait,
make a lot of noise, and as they swarm I throw

226
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:46,970
Whisper and throw it into his shoulder blades, and
then on I'm piggyback.

227
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:53,200
LAURA: No. What? Why? They're already at the top.

228
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:59,718
LIAM: Yes, but would the Fireball, where they are,
encompass them all or-- I'm just saying if they--

229
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,164
MARISHA: Not all of them, but I can get a lot of
them.

230
00:17:02,164 --> 00:17:03,619
SAM: I can also throw some Fireballs.

231
00:17:03,619 --> 00:17:05,385
MARISHA: Yeah, we can Fireball together.

232
00:17:05,385 --> 00:17:07,142
LAURA: Percy and I just fly up and we start firing
down.

233
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:09,063
TALIESIN: I'm going to start making noise and just
boom-booming.

234
00:17:09,063 --> 00:17:15,828
MARISHA: I point to a spot for Percy to see if I
can get them to gather there, and I start readying

235
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:17,110
a Fireball to launch.

236
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:20,988
MATT: Okay, so the two of you fly over to that
side, and you start making Bad News explosion

237
00:17:20,988 --> 00:17:24,678
clatter as your gargantuan firearm just (gunshot
noises).

238
00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:26,919
TALIESIN: Yeah, some shots at them as I go.

239
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:31,181
MATT: And you take one or two of them down through
repeated shots as their armor cracks and breaks

240
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:32,786
and you hear (dying noises).

241
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:35,178
TALIESIN: We'll throw some meat down there too.

242
00:17:35,178 --> 00:17:39,605
LIAM: Is the noise centered on your gun, though,
and not down below?

243
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:42,449
LAURA: Yeah, but they'll gather in the spot to get
to it.

244
00:17:42,449 --> 00:17:45,973
MATT: They watch as you fly above, and you can
start see them shooting these jets of acid in the

245
00:17:46,018 --> 00:17:50,642
arc as it begins to spray through, and you mark a
little bit to stay just out of that range as you

246
00:17:50,642 --> 00:17:55,425
continue to do so. But the noise you are making
is-- you're watching them slowly cluster up

247
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:57,102
beneath where you guys are.

248
00:17:57,102 --> 00:18:01,114
MARISHA: Okay, let me know when it looks like a
good cluster.

249
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:09,064
MATT: You got a pretty good cluster, you could
probably get about ten in one blast.

250
00:18:09,064 --> 00:18:15,029
MARISHA: Yeah, let's just throw down a big ol'
Fireball.

251
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:16,689
MATT: All righty.

252
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:21,245
MARISHA: 20-foot radius.

253
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:23,340
SAM: (sings) You shake my nerve--

254
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,650
TRAVIS: (sings) -- and you rattle my brain.

255
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,601
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: (sing) Too much love drives a
man insane.

256
00:18:28,601 --> 00:18:36,345
ALL: (sing) You broke my will, oh, what a thrill.
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!

257
00:18:36,345 --> 00:18:39,887
MATT: And with that, for the sake of brevity on
this standpoint, you wait until they begin to

258
00:18:39,887 --> 00:18:45,277
gather into one space, and with a singular
Fireball, Keyleth, you watch as (explosion) you

259
00:18:45,277 --> 00:18:51,337
send four of them screeching down, falling into
the pit from the blast, while six of them appear

260
00:18:51,337 --> 00:18:56,385
to be heavily wounded or burned to a cinder and
run off screaming, before collapsing and then

261
00:18:56,385 --> 00:19:01,998
smoldering maybe 20 feet from the pit. More swoop
up to gather into that space, now that that

262
00:19:01,998 --> 00:19:06,649
explosion has drawn their attention as well. And
you see a few stop for a second, smelling the ruin

263
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:11,532
of their companions, and you see a moment there to
shoot another Fireball as soon as they're

264
00:19:11,532 --> 00:19:16,875
gathered. (explosion) This one finishes off any of
the stragglers there and heavily damages a handful

265
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:20,836
of others. You watch now, over the period of time
of you both shooting, you taking arrows and what's

266
00:19:20,836 --> 00:19:26,326
available, over the next five to six minutes or
so, you guys cut down the numbers to about half

267
00:19:26,326 --> 00:19:31,283
what they were. And there's now just broken
wreckage of ankhegs just torn open from the

268
00:19:31,283 --> 00:19:38,678
explosion, their chitinous armor fractured and
open with the smoldering innards burning and

269
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:45,181
sizzling from the impact of the fire. They start
to slow their ascent as more and more of them

270
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:48,368
begin to die, and you watch as they all begin to
burrow back into the earth,

271
00:19:48,368 --> 00:19:51,933
scattering deeper into the ground.

272
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:56,194
MARISHA: Hey... Vax, do you still have any of
that--

273
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:57,771
LAURA: You had to think about it.

274
00:19:57,771 --> 00:20:00,283
(laughter)

275
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:05,166
MARISHA: A hundred episodes, yeah. Five years, a
hundred episodes later. Do you still have any of

276
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:09,243
that poison? That poison-- anybody have any
poison?

277
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:10,778
TRAVIS: I do!

278
00:20:10,778 --> 00:20:11,769
MARISHA: You have poison?

279
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:13,229
TRAVIS: Yep! Yep, do you want some?

280
00:20:13,229 --> 00:20:14,458
MARISHA: Well, I was thinking--

281
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:17,574
TRAVIS: You got it. I pull out the jug and I yell,
"Poison!"

282
00:20:17,574 --> 00:20:20,346
MATT: Splashes around inside.

283
00:20:20,346 --> 00:20:21,697
MARISHA: That's pretty good, Grog.

284
00:20:21,697 --> 00:20:22,924
TRAVIS: Did you want to drink it?

285
00:20:22,924 --> 00:20:25,157
MARISHA: Well, no.

286
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,129
TRAVIS: No. It's really hardcore, if you do.

287
00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:35,111
MARISHA: Ah, another time. I'll raincheck you,
bud. Do we still have any more orc or boar parts?

288
00:20:35,111 --> 00:20:39,866
TRAVIS: No, we've got an orc, like, calf, and a
foot, and it looks like a skull,

289
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:41,786
covered in like, pasta sauce.

290
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:46,705
MARISHA: Yeah, like actual Raid. Like Raid. Like
if we dip, maybe, some food in poison and throw it

291
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:50,698
down there, everyone that's left will come and
eventually eat it and die.

292
00:20:50,698 --> 00:20:55,951
LAURA: I think we have, like, 40 or 50 of them
left, right? And they're burrowed, now?

293
00:20:55,951 --> 00:21:00,726
MATT: Some of them have burrowed and some have
gotten wind of the wreckage and ruin--

294
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:04,629
LAURA: (gasps) I wonder if we could send fire into
the caves where they've burrowed?

295
00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:08,641
LIAM: Or you've created tsunamis, as well, d'you
think you could flush them out?

296
00:21:08,641 --> 00:21:14,939
MARISHA: I could-- I do still have my sixth-level
spell, I could attempt to get to a few of their

297
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:17,311
tunnels and collapse their tunnels.

298
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:20,050
SAM: Can you fill the whole tunnel with water and
drown them?

299
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,451
MARISHA: I could--

300
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:25,405
SAM: Too big. Too big.

301
00:21:25,405 --> 00:21:27,238
LAURA: What's too big?

302
00:21:27,238 --> 00:21:29,073
SAM: To fill the whole tunnel with water and drown
'em?

303
00:21:29,073 --> 00:21:30,411
LAURA: That's a lot.

304
00:21:30,411 --> 00:21:32,652
TALIESIN: We can't create chemicals, can we?

305
00:21:32,652 --> 00:21:37,128
SAM: (laughs) Your mind.

306
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:44,456
MARISHA: Hm, no, not really. I can create water,
but I don't think

307
00:21:44,456 --> 00:21:46,989
it would be enough to flush them out.

308
00:21:46,989 --> 00:21:49,170
TRAVIS: I just made this poison for, like, no
fucking reason?

309
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,427
(laughter)

310
00:21:51,427 --> 00:21:53,936
TALIESIN: We could do shots. I'm just kidding.

311
00:21:53,936 --> 00:21:56,802
MARISHA: I mean, you volunteered it very quickly.

312
00:21:56,802 --> 00:22:01,049
TRAVIS: Are we just above the hole?

313
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:02,880
MATT: You're above the hole, holding the jug--

314
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:09,209
TRAVIS: I take initiative and I take the orc leg,
dunk it in the poison, toss it, then I take the

315
00:22:09,209 --> 00:22:12,069
last-- this is the last orc piece in the bag--

316
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:15,861
MARISHA: Is that remnants of Dork, still?

317
00:22:15,861 --> 00:22:20,908
TRAVIS: I dunno. No, no. The ox is way gone, that
poor bastard.

318
00:22:20,908 --> 00:22:23,034
TALIESIN: We burned through that ages ago.

319
00:22:23,034 --> 00:22:25,954
TRAVIS: Two little orc parts, now poisoned and...

320
00:22:26,015 --> 00:22:32,271
MATT: Yeah. Two-- they're very soft. Very, like,
long-cooked lamb, just dripping off the bone,

321
00:22:32,271 --> 00:22:33,811
you're like-- throw it off there--

322
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,966
LAURA: We might have some stuff in the Bag of
Colding.

323
00:22:35,966 --> 00:22:39,043
MATT: Were they in the Bag of Colding? No. They're
definitely soft.

324
00:22:39,043 --> 00:22:43,312
MARISHA: If I do like, a Commune with Nature, and
then, because I know they're already--

325
00:22:43,312 --> 00:22:45,043
MATT: Build a commune with nature?

326
00:22:45,043 --> 00:22:48,899
MARISHA: Commune with Nature, and I--

327
00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:51,123
LIAM: Whoa. Glass houses, and all of that.

328
00:22:51,123 --> 00:22:54,343
MATT: I like the image of a spell that-- I just
like a spell that creates a hippie commune

329
00:22:54,343 --> 00:22:56,897
somewhere in your fantasy world. I think it's
pretty cool.

330
00:22:56,897 --> 00:23:01,957
MARISHA: I thought that was Conjure Fae.

331
00:23:01,957 --> 00:23:04,486
MATT: True enough. Continue, what are you doing?

332
00:23:04,486 --> 00:23:11,162
MARISHA: Can I, because I already got a map of
their tunnels. Can I then do Move Earth to, like,

333
00:23:11,162 --> 00:23:13,763
try and collapse?

334
00:23:13,763 --> 00:23:16,709
MATT: You get the sense that as burrowing
creatures, collapsing the tunnels might slow them

335
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:18,475
down, but they'll probably still dig their way
out.

336
00:23:18,475 --> 00:23:22,177
TALIESIN: What are the chances I have materials
for making explosives on me?

337
00:23:22,177 --> 00:23:26,011
MATT: I mean, enough to maybe, like--

338
00:23:26,011 --> 00:23:29,683
TALIESIN: No, but like just the materials, not the
time to make them, but just the materials. Because

339
00:23:29,683 --> 00:23:34,784
one of the materials in making TNT is diatomaceous
earth. And if it's micronized diatomaceous earth,

340
00:23:34,784 --> 00:23:36,811
that means it's actually an insecticide.

341
00:23:36,888 --> 00:23:39,302
TRAVIS: Fucking Taliesin Jaffe. What are you
talking about?

342
00:23:39,302 --> 00:23:41,526
TALIESIN: Specifically for hard-shell insects.

343
00:23:41,526 --> 00:23:43,878
ASHLEY: I have an idea! I have an idea.

344
00:23:43,878 --> 00:23:46,680
SAM: Pike has an idea!

345
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,683
MATT: You wouldn't have anywhere near enough to do
what you're trying to do.

346
00:23:48,683 --> 00:23:50,248
ASHLEY: I'm going to--

347
00:23:50,248 --> 00:23:53,047
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait!

348
00:23:53,047 --> 00:23:54,363
MATT: Pike?

349
00:23:54,363 --> 00:23:56,348
ASHLEY: I would like to cast Earthquake--

350
00:23:56,348 --> 00:23:57,666
MATT: Okay.

351
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:59,303
ASHLEY: And maybe I can wiggle it all closed.

352
00:23:59,303 --> 00:24:04,972
MATT: Okay. Okay. So you cast Earthquake, what's
the casting time on that?

353
00:24:04,972 --> 00:24:07,874
ASHLEY: It's just one action.

354
00:24:07,874 --> 00:24:14,169
MATT: Okay. So you look there and focus for a
second, close your eyes, and you guys watch as the

355
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:23,865
edges of the sinkhole begin to shift. The single
tower that was partially collapsed? Collapses into

356
00:24:23,865 --> 00:24:27,785
full bits of rock and rubble, and some of it
spills further into the tunnel as the tunnel

357
00:24:27,785 --> 00:24:34,536
begins to cave in. Basically, you fill in the rest
of the sinkhole, and the mine now drops 25, 30

358
00:24:34,536 --> 00:24:42,201
feet as the rest of the earth comes and fills it
in. Eventually, the rumbling slows and comes to a

359
00:24:42,201 --> 00:24:46,072
calm, and you see now there's a dip where the
space in the forest was-- it's like a big bowl,

360
00:24:46,072 --> 00:24:51,387
and some of the trees fall into it and get buried
in the earth and stone as it collapses inward.

361
00:24:51,387 --> 00:24:58,883
LIAM: I love that everybody was up here bickering
and Pike just went "hm."

362
00:24:58,883 --> 00:25:02,005
(laughter)

363
00:25:02,005 --> 00:25:08,146
MATT: A few moments pass, and you watch as some of
the ankhegs begin to pop out, like the collapsed

364
00:25:08,146 --> 00:25:12,455
tunnels have forced them to begin burrowing their
way to the surface to orient themselves. You watch

365
00:25:12,455 --> 00:25:20,329
as about five, ten, 20 or so of these begin to
emerge, and as they emerge they look around the

366
00:25:20,329 --> 00:25:23,871
space. And you watch them looking at each other
and sniffing the area--

367
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:26,814
ASHLEY: I'm going to Fire Storm them.

368
00:25:26,814 --> 00:25:29,490
MARISHA: You're going to Fire Storm them?

369
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:32,940
TRAVIS: Just let Pike off the leash.

370
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,488
SAM: Oh, by the way, I can create a holocaust? Is
that what you're doing?

371
00:25:37,488 --> 00:25:41,094
(laughter)

372
00:25:41,094 --> 00:25:45,448
MATT: (sings) Pike can end this world in a
holocaust, in a holocaust-- All right, so. As

373
00:25:45,448 --> 00:25:53,040
everyone's marveling over your Earthquake, little
Pike goes, "And also--" And you watch as about 30

374
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,222
or so of these creatures have now emerged, and
they're all communicating with each other, and their

375
00:25:56,222 --> 00:26:00,892
antennas are going by, and they're beginning to
look around-- and this streak, this zigzag of

376
00:26:01,056 --> 00:26:10,265
burning flame just tears across the base of this
bowl and just incinerates about 20 of them. You

377
00:26:10,265 --> 00:26:15,851
now see them immediately smoldering, turning to
ash, these blackened clusters of heavily charred

378
00:26:15,851 --> 00:26:22,335
husk, and the others that came to the surface just
scatter into the forest. You get the sense that

379
00:26:22,335 --> 00:26:28,150
the ruin you've left, the collapsing of the
tunnels and the rather large portion of their

380
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:32,862
populace that you've left destroyed, there's
probably not much of an infestation

381
00:26:32,862 --> 00:26:34,508
left here in the mines.

382
00:26:34,508 --> 00:26:35,950
TRAVIS: Yeah, not too bad, Vasquez.

383
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,576
LAURA: Did we also destroy the mine?

384
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:40,447
TALIESIN: Well, it's still there, it's just been
filled in.

385
00:26:40,447 --> 00:26:47,313
MARISHA: Plus, technically isn't the point of a
mine to, like, dig out holes?

386
00:26:47,313 --> 00:26:52,093
TALIESIN: Now they can dig extra. The
Etch-A-Sketch has been shaken.

387
00:26:52,093 --> 00:26:55,204
LIAM: There's none left? They're all gone?

388
00:26:55,204 --> 00:26:58,040
MATT: I mean, that you saw come to the surface
gathered.

389
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,130
LAURA: I think we did a good job.

390
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:02,541
LIAM: We could've smushed those and gotten so
drunk.

391
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:05,175
ASHLEY: How do you feel, Tary?

392
00:27:05,175 --> 00:27:10,812
SAM: That's pretty awesome. (laughs) Yeah, I think
mission accomplished. Let's go.

393
00:27:10,812 --> 00:27:15,605
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think we did it. Let's get the
fuck out of here.

394
00:27:15,605 --> 00:27:22,938
MATT: Okay. So. You guys make your way back
towards Deastok-- Yes. Make your way back towards

395
00:27:22,938 --> 00:27:30,292
Deastok. You still have access to your Wind Walk,
since it's not concentration, it lasts a while, so

396
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:35,189
quickly enough, with your equipment in place, you
guys can traverse rapidly back to the city in

397
00:27:35,189 --> 00:27:44,141
which you began this journey. You make your way
back to The Grumpy Lily, introduce yourself to the

398
00:27:44,141 --> 00:27:47,306
two denizens within, with the phrase, if you
recall.

399
00:27:47,306 --> 00:27:51,811
TRAVIS: Chicken and biscuits.

400
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:53,934
SAM: The Many, the Many, yes.

401
00:27:53,934 --> 00:27:58,473
MATT: The same elderly gentleman is like, "Well,
okay," and shuffles over and opens the same

402
00:27:58,473 --> 00:28:02,734
doorway that leads you through the stairs, into
the central hallway where there's that one gruff

403
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:09,295
guy on the stool, he recognizes you, nudges you
and opens the door. And you step into the tavern.

404
00:28:09,295 --> 00:28:13,771
It's not as busy as it was last time, it's 
probably about maybe two-thirds of the clientele

405
00:28:13,771 --> 00:28:18,215
there, but the music's still going, there's people
chatting, having drinks, and at a different table

406
00:28:18,215 --> 00:28:26,503
you see Korshad just sitting alone, hands still
crossed, cup half-full, still resting beneath him.

407
00:28:26,503 --> 00:28:32,336
And as soon as you enter, his eyes are trained on
you. Whether it was expectant or just sheer luck,

408
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:36,557
or his eyes are always trained on whoever enters
the door, as soon as you enter the establishment,

409
00:28:36,557 --> 00:28:41,866
you watch as his smile cracks the sides of his
mouth and his-- the edges of his eyes, the little

410
00:28:41,866 --> 00:28:45,930
crows' feet curl up a bit. And he motions you
over.

411
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,568
MARISHA: Do you think he has friends? He's always
alone.

412
00:28:48,568 --> 00:28:52,069
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to start eyeballing the room
while sis goes and talks.

413
00:28:52,069 --> 00:28:56,298
TRAVIS: Is Camilla still playing music?

414
00:28:56,298 --> 00:29:00,134
MATT: The musicians are not currently playing.

415
00:29:00,134 --> 00:29:01,736
LAURA: What time is it now?

416
00:29:01,736 --> 00:29:09,212
MATT: At this point, it's early morning. I'll say
for the purposes of the hour that you got there,

417
00:29:09,212 --> 00:29:14,919
best that I can recall, it's like 1:30 in the
morning. It's pretty late.

418
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,705
SAM: Excuse me, may we sit and talk?

419
00:29:18,705 --> 00:29:22,164
MATT: "But of course. Have a seat."

420
00:29:22,164 --> 00:29:29,691
SAM: Thank you. We have done our share of the
bargain, and we're here

421
00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:34,112
to cash in our chit, as it were.

422
00:29:34,112 --> 00:29:43,947
MATT: His head looks at you. "You did not leave
but a number of hours ago. Am I to expect that you

423
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:47,042
"have completed this task already?"

424
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:49,214
LAURA: Yeah, we're really, really good.

425
00:29:49,214 --> 00:29:52,270
MARISHA: And you should know that if you've
apparently been watching us?

426
00:29:52,270 --> 00:30:01,172
MATT: He motions his finger up towards one of the
second rows, and you watch as one of the guards

427
00:30:01,172 --> 00:30:05,051
there, the ones that you've noticed before and
kept your eyes on that have the hidden crossbows,

428
00:30:05,051 --> 00:30:09,263
knocks on the edge of a door that opens up
slightly. He whispers to somebody and a few

429
00:30:09,263 --> 00:30:16,890
moments later another guard walks up, escorting
what looks to be a young mousy woman of red-brown

430
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:21,790
skin. Her eyes, as soon as you get a glance, are
snow-blind. And you watch as the guard that's with

431
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:26,532
her is actually holding her arm and guiding her as
she walks. She has big black curls that trail down

432
00:30:26,532 --> 00:30:33,888
to her middle back and as she's led to the table
Korshad gives a little whistle. And a drink is

433
00:30:33,888 --> 00:30:39,898
brought at her place and she sits down. Looks a
little confused and nervous, but sits down and

434
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:51,300
leans into Korshad, and he turns to her and says,
"This is Duala. She will confirm your words. Duala?"

435
00:30:51,300 --> 00:31:00,540
She glances her face over past your group
and as she does, she reaches into a pouch and

436
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:06,597
brings out what looks to be a few stone runes. And
she clatters them across the table. And as soon as

437
00:31:06,597 --> 00:31:11,567
she puts her fingers out in front and spreads them
like that, the runes all magnetically (scraping)

438
00:31:11,567 --> 00:31:18,474
shift to match the placement of her fingers below.
Her snow-blind eyes now go pure white. And there's

439
00:31:18,474 --> 00:31:22,320
just a moment where you watch as her head begins
to drift back like a slow hinge.

440
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,009
MARISHA: Do I recognize this spell?

441
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:25,294
MATT: You do not.

442
00:31:25,294 --> 00:31:26,517
MARISHA: Okay.

443
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:35,233
MATT: At least not this form of casting. After a
minute or so, her eyes come back to their

444
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:44,889
snow-blind appearance, her fingers curl back in
and with a very small voice she goes, "The mine is

445
00:31:44,889 --> 00:31:57,853
"cleansed, though the mine is also collapsed."
Korshad's looking at her, and goes, "But you say

446
00:31:57,853 --> 00:32:10,951
"it is cleansed, yes. Of everything?" She gives a
nod. "It is free." He looks back to you all with a

447
00:32:10,951 --> 00:32:30,555
very sly, begrudging brow, one eye still partially
closed. "Very well. We will send men to confirm

448
00:32:30,555 --> 00:32:37,262
"the depths of this, and operations will begin. If
at any point it is discovered that this was some

449
00:32:37,262 --> 00:32:47,441
"sort of charade or the means of our agreement were
not met fully, we will be happy to make sure the

450
00:32:47,441 --> 00:32:55,129
"rest of the Darrington estate falls back squarely
under our grasp. However, for the time being and

451
00:32:55,129 --> 00:33:00,216
"if what you say is true..." He reaches under the
table and sifts through a small sack that he had

452
00:33:00,216 --> 00:33:11,490
held between his feet and ankles, pulls out a
heavy piece of parchment. "The deed to the

453
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:17,687
"Darrington estate. Signed over to one Taryon
Darrington."

454
00:33:17,687 --> 00:33:27,202
SAM: Might I make a few more requests? When last
we spoke, we spoke in vague terms. There was some

455
00:33:27,202 --> 00:33:37,575
cash talked about, and also a place for my family
to make a little bit of money or food. There's a

456
00:33:37,575 --> 00:33:45,017
farmhouse nearby our main estate. It's nothing
special, a few acres of land. I would love to keep

457
00:33:45,017 --> 00:33:49,704
that as well so that we can have a source of food
for the winters.

458
00:33:49,704 --> 00:33:55,426
MATT: Make a persuasion check, Mr. Doe-Eyed
Young'un.

459
00:33:55,426 --> 00:33:57,310
LAURA: Blink-blink!

460
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:02,827
SAM: 22.

461
00:34:02,827 --> 00:34:18,153
MATT: 22. "Hmm. You are young. Not yet spoiled by
the strange truths of the world around you. I

462
00:34:18,153 --> 00:34:25,668
"admire your optimism in the face of the unknown.
It may be your salvation or it may be your end.

463
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:29,600
"Only time will tell. I'll give you this
farmland."

464
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,313
SAM: We are most grateful.

465
00:34:32,313 --> 00:34:43,116
MATT: "But. If at any point your family comes back
to me requesting any more inches in our agreement,

466
00:34:43,116 --> 00:34:47,309
"I will happily take it back."

467
00:34:47,309 --> 00:34:54,110
SAM: Understood. I wasn't quite finished yet,
though.

468
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:59,576
MATT: He leans back in his chair, his arms now
being removed from his mouth and going to an

469
00:34:59,576 --> 00:35:01,897
expectant cross.

470
00:35:01,897 --> 00:35:08,354
SAM: What we saw down there in the platinum mines
was the 230,000 gold that we owe you times ten.

471
00:35:08,354 --> 00:35:14,381
Times 20. What we've just done for you has given
you access to as much money as you could ever

472
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:21,882
want, and I feel that's valuable. My family will
require a bit of spending money to get ourselves

473
00:35:21,882 --> 00:35:29,946
back on our feet. We are... accustomed to a
lifestyle, and we'd like to maintain it for a

474
00:35:29,946 --> 00:35:35,994
little while at least. I'd say 50,000 gold should
be about enough to last us for a year or two.

475
00:35:35,994 --> 00:35:41,631
MATT: He nods, leans forward. "Then you'd better
start saving."

476
00:35:41,631 --> 00:35:53,096
SAM: What if I sweetened the deal? We have among
us an amazing sorceress who could open that mine

477
00:35:53,096 --> 00:36:01,529
up for you with a flick of her wrist, save you
hours and hours of work. Possibly back-breaking

478
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:04,797
work that could cost the lives of many of your
men.

479
00:36:04,797 --> 00:36:09,651
MATT: "That would be a very kind gesture towards
the state you left the mine in."

480
00:36:09,651 --> 00:36:16,348
SAM: (clears throat) So that's a maybe?

481
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:25,562
MATT: "Let's call it the last thread of my
patience, young Darrington."

482
00:36:25,562 --> 00:36:27,846
SAM: So that's a hard yes.

483
00:36:27,846 --> 00:36:29,550
(laughter)

484
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:35,225
MATT: "Duala, you may return to your quarters."
"Thank you very much." She gets up and looks past

485
00:36:35,225 --> 00:36:40,181
you all with a nod, and then her guardian escorts
her back into the chamber as Korshad is just

486
00:36:40,181 --> 00:36:51,004
trained on you. "What I have given you is far more
than many in my position would. I will work hard

487
00:36:51,004 --> 00:37:01,711
"to make sure that this softness I have displayed
does not hinder my reputation. And the more you

488
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:10,590
"press, the more you may be the end of that
softness, my friend. I recommend you stick to the

489
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:18,462
"deal we've made. Be happy that I've shown any
mercy. And be on your way."

490
00:37:18,462 --> 00:37:25,828
SAM: All right. I'll make do, and we'll have to
adjust our living standards, that's all.

491
00:37:25,828 --> 00:37:32,779
MATT: "Indeed. Perhaps your father might raise a
finger or two and earn some money for himself."

492
00:37:32,779 --> 00:37:41,490
SAM: We'll see. Thank you. Bidet.

493
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:46,215
MATT: "Good evening."

494
00:37:46,215 --> 00:37:49,178
LAURA: He almost said it back.

495
00:37:49,178 --> 00:37:50,590
SAM: Almost.

496
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,286
LAURA: We're starting something.

497
00:37:52,286 --> 00:37:56,512
MATT: He takes a drink, and sips it, and gives
this motion with his hand as his eyes finally

498
00:37:56,512 --> 00:38:01,678
avert from Taryon and the rest of your group and
he looks away with a contemplative expression. As

499
00:38:01,678 --> 00:38:08,585
he does so, you watch as the guards all begin to
shift out of the crowd. And you watch as many of

500
00:38:08,585 --> 00:38:12,999
the various tavern folk that were laughing and
drinking are all quiet now,

501
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,589
looking upon the rest of you.

502
00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:17,498
TRAVIS: That's some Moriarty shit right there.

503
00:38:17,498 --> 00:38:21,646
MATT: And you get the sense that pretty much
everybody in this establishment, patron or not,

504
00:38:21,646 --> 00:38:30,537
are all keeping an eye on this. They're all part
of Korshad's guard in some way, shape or form, and

505
00:38:30,537 --> 00:38:32,189
you've been given leave.

506
00:38:32,189 --> 00:38:33,828
MARISHA: You're totally right, he has so many
friends.

507
00:38:33,828 --> 00:38:34,801
TALIESIN: I told you.

508
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:38,965
TRAVIS: Let's do this. Everyone dies. Everybody.
Let's light it up.

509
00:38:38,965 --> 00:38:46,406
MATT: You watch as Wence comes up to you, as this
is happening, and goes, "Hi. Look. You seem like

510
00:38:46,406 --> 00:38:48,830
"very nice folk. You should probably..." (clicks
tongue)

511
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:49,918
LAURA: We're leaving.

512
00:38:49,918 --> 00:38:54,649
MATT: "Okay, good. Drink for the road?" And he
gives you a little shot, to you, Vex, and goes,

513
00:38:54,649 --> 00:38:56,280
(tongue click).

514
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,555
ASHLEY: But why do we have to go? I'm just
kidding.

515
00:38:58,555 --> 00:39:00,299
(laughter)

516
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:02,674
ASHLEY: I just really like it here!

517
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:08,088
MATT: And that was the end of Vox Machina's story.
No. All right. You make your way out, back up

518
00:39:08,088 --> 00:39:16,887
through the Grumpy Lily, back onto the streets of
the deep, deep dark morning hours in Deastok. What

519
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,531
do you wish to do?

520
00:39:18,531 --> 00:39:20,729
MARISHA: Wow, that was weird, you guys. It was
weird.

521
00:39:20,729 --> 00:39:22,202
LAURA: Do we need to tell your family what we did?

522
00:39:22,202 --> 00:39:23,190
SAM: Absolutely.

523
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,576
LIAM: Break the news to dad, yeah?

524
00:39:24,576 --> 00:39:26,134
LAURA: Right now. In the morning?

525
00:39:26,134 --> 00:39:28,948
SAM: I guess maybe in the morning? They're
probably all asleep now.

526
00:39:28,948 --> 00:39:35,010
LAURA: Well, I haven't actually had the drink yet,
I was afraid it might be poisoned.

527
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,265
SAM: Yeah, maybe not.

528
00:39:37,265 --> 00:39:39,484
TALIESIN: I'm going to steal a sip of the drink.

529
00:39:39,484 --> 00:39:41,364
LAURA: (gasps) Percival!

530
00:39:41,364 --> 00:39:43,443
MATT: Make a con-- no, I'm kidding.

531
00:39:43,443 --> 00:39:45,061
(laughter)

532
00:39:45,061 --> 00:39:46,796
TALIESIN: I haven't swallowed it, I'm just going,
hmm, hmm.

533
00:39:46,796 --> 00:39:48,015
LAURA: How is he?

534
00:39:48,015 --> 00:39:50,958
MATT: It numbs a bit of the surface skin, seems
like a strong alcohol.

535
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:55,884
LAURA: You're fine? All right, fine. All right.
Congratulations, us. Maybe later.

536
00:39:55,884 --> 00:40:00,427
TRAVIS: We are a little beat up and stuff.

537
00:40:00,427 --> 00:40:04,225
LAURA: We should probably heal up. Talk to your
father in the morning.

538
00:40:04,225 --> 00:40:06,029
SAM: We'll go to my house.

539
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,392
TALIESIN: Your house!

540
00:40:07,392 --> 00:40:09,056
MARISHA: It is now your house.

541
00:40:09,056 --> 00:40:10,580
SAM: Yes, it is.

542
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,478
LIAM: Whose house? T's house.

543
00:40:12,478 --> 00:40:13,901
TALIESIN: Well done.

544
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:16,967
LAURA: It's in your name.

545
00:40:16,967 --> 00:40:19,281
MARISHA: You're a homeowner.

546
00:40:19,281 --> 00:40:21,291
SAM: I could get a second mortgage!

547
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:23,126
LAURA: You could kick your dad out!

548
00:40:23,126 --> 00:40:25,297
MARISHA: You get to pay property taxes!

549
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,751
SAM: Oh, god.

550
00:40:26,751 --> 00:40:28,206
ASHLEY: You could refinance!

551
00:40:28,206 --> 00:40:31,244
SAM: I could refinance. I hear mortgage rates are
really low right now.

552
00:40:31,244 --> 00:40:33,567
LAURA: I hear the Myriad's giving really good
deals.

553
00:40:33,567 --> 00:40:37,696
MATT: So you make your way back to the Darrington
estate?

554
00:40:37,696 --> 00:40:38,816
SAM: Yes.

555
00:40:38,816 --> 00:40:47,801
MATT: Okay. The guest quarters are cramped for the
volume of travelers you have with you, but as you

556
00:40:47,801 --> 00:40:54,431
approach and knock on the door, there's a slight
pause before your...

557
00:40:54,431 --> 00:40:56,909
SAM: Berthold?

558
00:40:56,909 --> 00:41:01,195
MATT: Yes, thank you. Berthold, the brass-skinned
dragonborn companion comes up with his nightcap on

559
00:41:01,195 --> 00:41:08,903
in front of his face, and he's got his little
lantern. He's like, "I assume you wish to stay

560
00:41:08,903 --> 00:41:16,879
"here. I'll arrange for... Come in, come in." He
rubs his eyes as he leads you inside. It's quiet

561
00:41:16,879 --> 00:41:22,136
and still, and the house is dark. No light aside
from the small lantern that Berthold has, and he

562
00:41:22,136 --> 00:41:28,032
leads you on the bottom floor to the guest
quarters, which are two separate rooms, each with

563
00:41:28,032 --> 00:41:37,054
a singular bed. You watch as he begins to grab
cushions from various chairs and display sofas

564
00:41:37,054 --> 00:41:42,416
that are covered in dust, that haven't been sat in
for a decade, at least, and is trying to arrange

565
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:46,424
them in a haphazard floor bedding scenario.

566
00:41:46,424 --> 00:41:48,833
TALIESIN: I want to see where he's going with
this.

567
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:56,403
MATT: He gets to a point where he gives up and
goes, "Oh, there. Good night." And walks away.

568
00:41:56,403 --> 00:41:59,301
LAURA: Well, we've slept in blanket forts before.

569
00:41:59,301 --> 00:42:02,019
LIAM: Not the first, not the last.

570
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,696
MARISHA: I get the big cushion!

571
00:42:04,696 --> 00:42:07,088
TALIESIN: It's got a bar in the middle.

572
00:42:07,088 --> 00:42:09,782
MARISHA: Display furniture sucks.

573
00:42:09,782 --> 00:42:13,151
MATT: You still do have your room, Taryon, if you
want to use it.

574
00:42:13,151 --> 00:42:15,805
SAM: My room? Oh, yeah, of course I'm going up
there.

575
00:42:15,805 --> 00:42:20,287
TRAVIS: Oh, really, you're going to leave us down
here? Fucking high-born piece of shit?

576
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:29,693
SAM: All right, I'll stay back down here with the
pillow fort thing. Fine. But after they go to

577
00:42:29,693 --> 00:42:34,464
sleep, I go upstairs and go back to my bed.

578
00:42:34,464 --> 00:42:37,300
MATT: Okay, then. Make a stealth check.

579
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,967
SAM: Oh, Jesus. Four.

580
00:42:39,967 --> 00:42:43,807
MATT: Half of you open an eye in the middle of the
night as you

581
00:42:43,807 --> 00:42:45,935
hear the creaking of the wood flooring.

582
00:42:45,935 --> 00:42:47,797
SAM: Just going to the bathroom!

583
00:42:47,797 --> 00:42:54,016
LIAM: By the way, do you have any beast changing
left in you?

584
00:42:54,016 --> 00:42:55,890
MARISHA: I do, yeah.

585
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:57,196
LIAM: Could you go Minxie for me?

586
00:42:57,196 --> 00:42:58,400
LAURA: Oh, kinky.

587
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,098
TRAVIS: Gross, we're all in the same room.

588
00:43:00,098 --> 00:43:01,799
MARISHA: Yes, why?

589
00:43:01,799 --> 00:43:03,376
LIAM: I want a pillow.

590
00:43:03,376 --> 00:43:05,405
MARISHA: Fine.

591
00:43:05,405 --> 00:43:08,108
TALIESIN: That is the most Brian Blessed thing
ever.

592
00:43:08,108 --> 00:43:10,320
LAURA: You could've just used Trinket.

593
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,488
MATT: Trinket farts are an issue. Then again, so
are Minxie farts.

594
00:43:14,488 --> 00:43:18,018
ASHLEY: I want to get in a circle, like a dog, on
one of the cushions.

595
00:43:18,018 --> 00:43:19,879
TALIESIN: You turn around three times.

596
00:43:19,879 --> 00:43:27,027
MATT: That's how rock gnomes sleep, they do a
little circle around the cushion.

597
00:43:27,027 --> 00:43:30,451
LIAM: I just turn into Macklemore.

598
00:43:30,451 --> 00:43:39,075
MATT: All right. So you make it to your room, left
as it was. Most of the furniture is covered in

599
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:44,756
sheets, but untouched as to where you left it the
last time you were here. There's a firm layer of

600
00:43:44,756 --> 00:43:49,057
dust across most of it, and as you step into the
room, with each step you can see the footfalls

601
00:43:49,057 --> 00:43:55,782
leaving a small trail on the floor. You have a
large shelf of books that line the right wall. You

602
00:43:55,782 --> 00:43:59,446
can see the footsteps to and from the bookshelf
where it seems like your mother has taken, here

603
00:43:59,446 --> 00:44:04,605
and there, little elements of your collection. You
see the covered outline of your workbench, which

604
00:44:04,605 --> 00:44:09,256
inhabits the far side of the chamber, and a
familiar smell of old oil and leathers immediately

605
00:44:09,256 --> 00:44:17,498
causes a flood of memories to hit you of growing
up in this space. You do see, poking out from one

606
00:44:17,498 --> 00:44:23,844
of these sheets, some of the leftover pieces from
when you constructed your first Doty, and you see

607
00:44:23,844 --> 00:44:30,051
the armored hand, partially open with some of the
gears and runes only partially put into the hand

608
00:44:30,051 --> 00:44:34,912
and then discarded and left to the side, and it
also reminds you of those years. You have this

609
00:44:34,912 --> 00:44:40,910
nostalgic wave hit you as you pull the sheet off
your bed, and dust it out, and fluff your pillow,

610
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:45,362
and for the first time in a long time, have a
night's sleep in your own chambers.

611
00:44:45,362 --> 00:44:47,850
SAM: I'll cuddle with the Doty arm.

612
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:57,152
MATT: It's very cold, but sleep does take you. You
guys finish your evening's rest. You awake. After

613
00:44:57,152 --> 00:45:01,922
the stress of the previous battle of the day, you
all tend to sleep in for the most part, plus the

614
00:45:01,922 --> 00:45:08,490
late hour of eventually getting to rest. You all
eventually come to later in the morning, closer to

615
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:16,620
noon, but as you wake up, you wake up to the smell
of food being cooked. You make your way out into

616
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:23,533
the central foyer area of the estate, and you can
see Berthold is running around the kitchen,

617
00:45:23,533 --> 00:45:26,933
desperately trying to put together whatever meal
is viable, and eventually shouts out,

618
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,185
"Breakfast is served!"

619
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:31,590
LIAM: What you got, Bertie?

620
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:38,768
MATT: "It's... dinner time! Dinner you're having--
breakfast, staying the night,

621
00:45:38,768 --> 00:45:41,109
"and the market wasn't open."

622
00:45:41,109 --> 00:45:43,069
LAURA: Potatoes!

623
00:45:43,069 --> 00:45:50,910
MATT: "Potatoes. Some bread, might be a bit stale.
I made some stew. Breakfast stew. It's just stew,

624
00:45:50,910 --> 00:46:00,196
"but you're having it for breakfast. Some
mushrooms. That's it. I am sorry."

625
00:46:00,196 --> 00:46:03,824
LIAM: A lot of carbs.

626
00:46:03,824 --> 00:46:08,108
TALIESIN: It's like Comic Con all over again.

627
00:46:08,108 --> 00:46:11,434
TRAVIS: Is this how we're supposed to eat in the
house of Darrington, Tary?

628
00:46:11,434 --> 00:46:13,969
LAURA: We just used up all of their food and they
don't have any left.

629
00:46:13,969 --> 00:46:17,610
SAM: I'm sorry. I'll talk to the help about this.

630
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:21,043
TRAVIS: Can't you pop a crystal off of that helmet
of yours and make a banquet?

631
00:46:21,043 --> 00:46:24,919
SAM: No. I could burn us all alive, though, with
one of them.

632
00:46:24,919 --> 00:46:26,354
TRAVIS: Not the same thing.

633
00:46:26,354 --> 00:46:29,826
TALIESIN: Did we ever discover whether or not the
magic jug does coffee?

634
00:46:29,826 --> 00:46:32,514
SAM: Only one way to find out.

635
00:46:32,514 --> 00:46:37,612
TRAVIS: Only one way to find out. Hold on. Be my
guest.

636
00:46:37,612 --> 00:46:38,916
LIAM: Americano.

637
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:42,128
TRAVIS: Nope.

638
00:46:42,128 --> 00:46:45,100
SAM: How about tea?

639
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,893
TALIESIN: Tea.

640
00:46:46,893 --> 00:46:48,722
TRAVIS: Nope.

641
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:55,223
MARISHA: It can make alcohol and poison, but it
can't make an English breakfast? Bullshit.

642
00:46:55,223 --> 00:46:57,394
LAURA: English breakfast ale!

643
00:46:57,394 --> 00:47:00,757
TRAVIS: Baked beans and sausages and-- ! No.

644
00:47:00,757 --> 00:47:04,821
MARISHA: Yeah, breakfast ale. That works.

645
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:13,346
MATT: As you guys complete your breakfast, you
notice that eventually Maryanne's voice begins to

646
00:47:13,346 --> 00:47:18,598
echo through the stairway. She comes down and
goes, "My word, Berthold, what are you cooking this-- "

647
00:47:18,598 --> 00:47:23,718
She comes down. You can see her hair is
curled in front of her face and pulled back and

648
00:47:23,718 --> 00:47:29,960
tied up into this tight bun in the back, and she's
just wearing this long, deep blue robe over her

649
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:40,253
casual silk blouse attire and pants. She glances
down, holding onto the railing. "Good morning."

650
00:47:40,253 --> 00:47:47,599
SAM: Good morning, sister. These are my friends,
Vox Machina.

651
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:48,691
ASHLEY: Hello.

652
00:47:48,691 --> 00:47:49,681
MATT: "Right."

653
00:47:49,681 --> 00:47:53,600
SAM: Grog, Pike, Vex, Vax, Percy, Keyleth.

654
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:58,464
MATT: "Pleasure. Brother, I wasn't aware we had
company staying."

655
00:47:58,464 --> 00:48:01,546
SAM: I travel with a group now.

656
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:04,333
MATT: "I've heard. I just didn't realize..."

657
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:09,284
SAM: I bring news, and I know it's early, but
could we have

658
00:48:09,284 --> 00:48:11,946
a little family meeting over breakfast?

659
00:48:11,946 --> 00:48:13,842
LAURA: It's super important.

660
00:48:13,842 --> 00:48:21,477
MATT: She gives you such a stink eye. "I'll go
speak to Father."

661
00:48:21,477 --> 00:48:23,270
SAM: And Mama.

662
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:26,680
MATT: "And Mama." And she heads up the stairs.

663
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,946
MARISHA: She seems nice.

664
00:48:28,946 --> 00:48:30,298
SAM: She is not.

665
00:48:30,298 --> 00:48:32,025
LAURA: I like her a lot.

666
00:48:32,025 --> 00:48:39,857
MATT: About five minutes pass, and you hear the
sound of multiple footfalls as the rest of the

667
00:48:39,857 --> 00:48:45,156
Darrington family makes their way down. First you
have Maryanne, same attire, but she's a little

668
00:48:45,156 --> 00:48:52,090
more put together. You can see now she's left the
robe behind to have more of her classic formal

669
00:48:52,090 --> 00:49:01,554
presenting-to-company outfit. Behind her you have
Mariya, your mother, who is in practically the

670
00:49:01,554 --> 00:49:05,305
same outfit she was in yesterday. She really
doesn't seem to care at this point, it's more

671
00:49:05,305 --> 00:49:06,946
about being comfortable.

672
00:49:06,946 --> 00:49:08,894
LAURA: Sweat pants!

673
00:49:08,894 --> 00:49:19,812
MATT: A few feet behind, to his own entrance,
there you see with his thick mutton chops and a

674
00:49:19,812 --> 00:49:32,973
tied-over, deep red, burgundy coat, Howaardt
Darrington. As they all enter, Mariya immediately

675
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:37,846
runs forward and goes, "Oh, I didn't realize
breakfast was going to be made!" She goes over and

676
00:49:37,846 --> 00:49:44,541
takes a little plate and starts filling it with
rolls and potatoes. She goes up and rubs your head

677
00:49:44,541 --> 00:49:48,842
a little bit and kisses you on the forehead, and
goes, "It's nice to have company."

678
00:49:48,842 --> 00:49:51,956
SAM: It's nice to be home.

679
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:53,363
LAURA: Did you want some stew?

680
00:49:53,363 --> 00:49:55,051
MATT: "Oh, yes."

681
00:49:55,051 --> 00:50:00,138
MATT: Howaardt, at this point, is sitting back
next to Maryanne, and goes (clears throat).

682
00:50:00,138 --> 00:50:02,940
LAURA: Oh, did you want some as well?

683
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:15,232
MATT: "I'm fine for now. Your sister tells me that
we are to have a family meeting."

684
00:50:15,232 --> 00:50:21,387
SAM: Yes, and with your permission, I would like
to invite my friends to stay for it as well, as it

685
00:50:21,387 --> 00:50:23,440
does concern them.

686
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,889
LIAM: Hey.

687
00:50:24,889 --> 00:50:26,242
MARISHA: Hi!

688
00:50:26,242 --> 00:50:27,528
TALIESIN: Charmed.

689
00:50:27,528 --> 00:50:29,415
MATT: "Very well."

690
00:50:29,415 --> 00:50:38,895
SAM: I bring you news, and I bring you a proposal,
and as a businessman I hope you'll listen to both.

691
00:50:38,895 --> 00:50:46,987
MATT: He seems keen at the choice of words. "Yes,
my son."

692
00:50:46,987 --> 00:50:56,396
SAM: First, the news. It's good news. First, I
will not be marrying this Lydia person. There's no

693
00:50:56,396 --> 00:51:05,900
need, and also I think we all know I would not be
happy in such a marriage, and we should all be

694
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:15,919
free to pursue whomever we love. That's beside the
point. It's not necessary, because I have made a

695
00:51:15,919 --> 00:51:26,860
deal with the Myriad. A deal that will spare us
from any danger, and clear us from all debt. We--

696
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:34,968
Well, they, really, carried out a task for the
Myriad that has absolved us of the debt that you

697
00:51:34,968 --> 00:51:38,708
ran up, and we are free and clear.

698
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:51,080
MATT: He looks to Mariya and Maryanne and softens
up. "I am... If what you say is true, then this is

699
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:59,183
"indeed a great day, and I owe each and every one
of you a great debt. We owe you a great debt."

700
00:51:59,183 --> 00:52:02,265
TALIESIN: Let's not get ahead of ourselves, but
thank you.

701
00:52:02,265 --> 00:52:09,327
SAM: Yes, they don't-- Forgive me for speaking on
your behalf. I don't think that they want to

702
00:52:09,327 --> 00:52:17,677
collect on a debt. They just did this because
we're friends. The forgiveness of debt comes with

703
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:25,495
some strings attached. We will lose most of our
property and assets, but we will maintain the

704
00:52:25,495 --> 00:52:34,494
homestead here, and all of its possessions and
artwork and belongings, we get to keep. We also

705
00:52:34,494 --> 00:52:42,426
get the nearby farmhouse and all of the land, and
we get a new lease on life, and a new beginning. I

706
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:53,530
think it's an opportunity for our family, and that
leads me to my proposal. Father, as much as I have

707
00:52:53,530 --> 00:53:01,263
respected you for keeping us safe and providing
for us, you have not given us the one thing a

708
00:53:01,263 --> 00:53:10,716
family needs, which is love. Real love. You have
made sure that we are safe, because you care about

709
00:53:10,716 --> 00:53:16,723
our blood, because it is your blood, and you care
about the fact that we bear your name, but you

710
00:53:16,723 --> 00:53:24,068
haven't given us the opportunity to be a real
family, and I believe we can be, if we start out

711
00:53:24,068 --> 00:53:34,214
new and fresh together. Here's my proposal. I will
come back and live with you, in Wildmount, and I

712
00:53:34,214 --> 00:53:47,902
will lead this family to a new chapter. Our
business model will change a bit. I propose that

713
00:53:47,902 --> 00:53:54,355
we do not engage in real estate anymore, but in
another venture.

714
00:53:54,355 --> 00:53:59,789
Forgive me, but you have sullied our name.

715
00:53:59,789 --> 00:54:05,151
MATT: Maryanne, at this point, says, "No, brother,
you have!" And you watch as Howaardt puts his hand

716
00:54:05,151 --> 00:54:11,653
out in front and dad-hands her, immediately, and
pushes her back, not stopping his gaze from you.

717
00:54:11,653 --> 00:54:18,292
His jaw clenches tight as he clears his throat and
his hands go back behind his body.

718
00:54:18,292 --> 00:54:31,787
SAM: The Darrington name is one of ill repute. We
are scoundrels, and we are land barons, and we are

719
00:54:31,787 --> 00:54:42,066
awful people, and now we are penniless awful
people. But I feel that we can fix it. What I

720
00:54:42,066 --> 00:54:52,005
propose is this: Our home will be vacated by us.
We are going to move to the farmhouse, where we

721
00:54:52,005 --> 00:54:58,288
will all live as a family. We will tend to the
farm, and we will raise crops together. Our home

722
00:54:58,288 --> 00:55:03,924
will be turned into the Darrington Fund, for
charitable giving, where people who are down on

723
00:55:03,924 --> 00:55:11,093
their luck can come and live and get back on their
feet. Now, such a fund will need donors, and you

724
00:55:11,093 --> 00:55:18,954
have many contacts in the business world. You, and
possibly sister, could run this foundation and

725
00:55:18,954 --> 00:55:23,535
spread goodness all over Wildmount, instead of
badness and evil.

726
00:55:23,535 --> 00:55:27,990
MATT: There's a flash of movement. Quicker than
you've seen your father move, he has grabbed a

727
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:33,620
chair behind him, and thrown it across the room,
smashing it against the nearby wall.

728
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:37,806
(heavy breathing)

729
00:55:37,806 --> 00:55:42,755
LIAM: I take a step forward and unsheathe a dagger
an inch and say, we're going to keep this civil

730
00:55:42,755 --> 00:55:45,265
today, aren't we?

731
00:55:45,265 --> 00:55:56,752
MATT: "You have no right to talk to me... You
stand here and shame the work that I've done, and

732
00:55:56,752 --> 00:56:05,385
"given my life to secure and give to you and your
sister, and to uphold the mistakes that my father

733
00:56:05,385 --> 00:56:14,644
"made to the best of my ability and fix them. And
you waltz in here after a year of adventuring and

734
00:56:14,644 --> 00:56:19,628
"just expect me to accept you throwing everything
I've worked for into the sewer?"

735
00:56:19,628 --> 00:56:26,612
SAM: I didn't do that, Father, you did. It's gone.
Everything is gone.

736
00:56:26,612 --> 00:56:31,072
You don't even own your own house anymore.

737
00:56:31,072 --> 00:56:34,880
MATT: "It wouldn't be that way if you would've
just married that girl."

738
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:44,201
SAM: That's not going to happen. In my year of
travel, I didn't just dilly-dally around the world

739
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:50,726
having fun. I was learning about the world and
about life and about family. I was learning from

740
00:56:50,726 --> 00:57:02,377
these fine people what it means to really be a
family, and care about each other. I learned from

741
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:11,815
Grog and Vax what it means to be a man, and to be
a father. I learned from Pike what it means to be

742
00:57:11,815 --> 00:57:19,555
a caring mother. I learned from Keyleth what a
real sister is like, one who loves you and cares

743
00:57:19,555 --> 00:57:28,559
for you. I learned from Vex what a best friend is
like. These are things you never gave us, growing

744
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:45,237
up. I even learned from Percival... the type of
man I would want to marry one day. And we never

745
00:57:45,237 --> 00:57:56,731
got that at home. And from this day forth, I'm
going to create a home, my home, that I own, that

746
00:57:56,731 --> 00:58:07,369
values and respects the opinions of each family
member. That cares for one another. Where we stick

747
00:58:07,369 --> 00:58:15,078
up for each other, and help each other through
hard times, and not just rule by decree. If you

748
00:58:15,078 --> 00:58:21,541
don't want to be a part of this, that's fine. You
can leave my house. But I want you to stay. I need

749
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:30,253
your counsel, and I need your help, and we need
you as a father. I need you and Sister to run this

750
00:58:30,253 --> 00:58:36,439
foundation for me, to repair our name and our
reputation. It could be great. It could be the

751
00:58:36,439 --> 00:58:52,427
best thing that's ever happened to us. And there's
more. I have an idea. To create something else. A

752
00:58:52,427 --> 00:59:02,339
team of adventurers, based here in Wildmount. The
Darrington Brigade, led by me, Taryon Darrington.

753
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:10,878
We will fight for justice, and win battles against
evildoers, and spread the Darrington name around

754
00:59:10,878 --> 00:59:23,058
the continent. I know I'm getting ahead of myself,
but I feel like if we embarked on this new

755
00:59:23,058 --> 00:59:33,641
adventure together, it could save our name and
repair our relationship. As a businessman, I'm

756
00:59:33,641 --> 00:59:44,039
asking you to consider it. Because your other
options are... Well, they're not great.

757
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:47,577
MATT: Make a persuasion check

758
00:59:47,577 --> 00:59:49,979
LAURA: The deal we made with the Myriad, sir...

759
00:59:49,979 --> 00:59:51,974
SAM: I'm going to use Luck.

760
00:59:51,974 --> 01:00:01,096
LAURA: No one would know that you were forced out
of your home. Everyone thinks that this was your

761
01:00:01,096 --> 01:00:03,280
choice, that you're being charitable.

762
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:07,223
SAM: I'm going to see if the fates can help me.

763
01:00:07,223 --> 01:00:09,005
TRAVIS: You're going to use it now?

764
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:10,878
LAURA: Oh my god.

765
01:00:10,878 --> 01:00:12,682
MARISHA: Cash it in!

766
01:00:12,682 --> 01:00:15,977
SAM: That's a 25.

767
01:00:15,977 --> 01:00:28,597
MATT: That's a moment to do it. You see as Mariya,
your mother, has now moved to the side of

768
01:00:28,597 --> 01:00:41,536
Howaardt, holding his arm. "Honey, there was no
other path. This is a gift." He pulls his arm from

769
01:00:41,536 --> 01:00:50,883
her and begins to walk toward you. You watch as
Maryanne has put on a shocked face, gone pale

770
01:00:50,883 --> 01:00:59,238
white, and for a moment, the facade of the adult
gives away to the child. "Father." As he walks up

771
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:09,186
to you, you watch as he brings his hand up, and
falls into his own hand, and falls to his knees on

772
01:01:09,186 --> 01:01:15,363
the ground. He's shaking, he's quaking. His fist
is clenched there, and he slams it into the

773
01:01:15,363 --> 01:01:22,197
ground, once, twice, a third time, each one a
resounding knock of him hitting bone and skin

774
01:01:22,197 --> 01:01:28,891
against wood. And he does it again, and again, and
again, all the anger and fury being focused into

775
01:01:28,891 --> 01:01:33,539
this. As he stops, you can see the blood pouring
from the side of the knuckles, and his hand is

776
01:01:33,539 --> 01:01:56,012
shaking. He stops and looks at it. (deep breath)
And for the first time-- not even the other

777
01:01:56,012 --> 01:02:03,024
evening, in which there was a sort of feigned
softness to him, that you have read through before

778
01:02:03,024 --> 01:02:15,541
and seen-- for the first time you see your father
as a broken man. He looks up at you. "I lost

779
01:02:15,541 --> 01:02:45,134
"everything. I did this to us." He looks back at
Mariya, and Maryanne, and to you. The dampness

780
01:02:45,134 --> 01:02:52,763
gathering down the side of his wrinkled cheeks,
gathering across the stubble on his chin, and

781
01:02:52,763 --> 01:03:13,442
vanishing amongst the cluster of thin, bristly
facial hair. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

782
01:03:13,442 --> 01:03:17,230
SAM: I am, too.

783
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:25,281
MATT: He looks about at this point. Now, his
focused anger has subsided, and this emotional

784
01:03:25,281 --> 01:03:31,911
moment realizing that there are strangers at the
table, and he (clears throat) "If you could please

785
01:03:31,911 --> 01:03:42,500
"give us a bit of time." His hand still clustered
there. He looks over to Berthold, who ushers you

786
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:55,847
all out front, you staying behind, Taryon. About
ten minutes or so, as you're all awkwardly waiting

787
01:03:55,847 --> 01:04:07,407
outside in the quiet. The cloudy day that
originally brought you into Deastok is breaking in

788
01:04:07,407 --> 01:04:12,339
places, you see hints of blue sky peeking through,
and a little bit of sunlight occasionally finding

789
01:04:12,339 --> 01:04:19,555
its way across the cobblestone roads of the
cityscape. You hear the occasional tweet of birds

790
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:25,545
as they jump from tree to tree. And in this
silence you really get to take in the surrounding

791
01:04:25,545 --> 01:04:31,272
beauty of this town, even as oppressive and gloomy
as your arrival may have been, and the tenseness

792
01:04:31,272 --> 01:04:44,079
of the work you had to do in this space. You allow
yourself to realize that this is a nice town. You

793
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:53,672
hear the door open once more from the front of the
estate, and there you see Maryanne, wet on the

794
01:04:53,672 --> 01:05:01,635
cheeks. "My father would like to speak to you,
if that's all right."

795
01:05:01,635 --> 01:05:02,999
TRAVIS: Yeah.

796
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:04,819
LAURA: Sure, sure.

797
01:05:04,819 --> 01:05:10,585
MATT: She steps back in and Howaardt comes back.
He is more composed than he was before. He is back

798
01:05:10,585 --> 01:05:26,736
to his presentory self. "When my son left, I was
under the impression that his fanciful ideas would

799
01:05:26,736 --> 01:05:40,081
"either break him and send him back to me to
finally listen to what I had to teach, if luck was

800
01:05:40,081 --> 01:05:50,378
"with us. If not, his fool's errand was bound to
get him killed. It is by some miracle that he

801
01:05:50,378 --> 01:06:12,105
"found you. I don't know what's in store for my
children, my wife, myself. There is a lot to

802
01:06:12,105 --> 01:06:38,346
"discuss, a lot to decide. Us as a family. And I'm
still processing all of it. I'm sorry you got

803
01:06:38,346 --> 01:06:52,906
"pulled into all of this, but I'm glad that you
gave him your friendship. And I'm sorry you had to

804
01:06:52,906 --> 01:07:08,872
"see this." He's hiding his bad hand under the good
one. "I'm sure in time I'll come to appreciate

805
01:07:08,872 --> 01:07:28,349
"this. Out of desperation and obsession, I became
my father, something I promised I would never do.

806
01:07:28,349 --> 01:07:46,237
"And I'm sorry." He looks back over his shoulder at
Tary, who's a few feet behind him. "I'm sorry."

807
01:07:46,237 --> 01:07:48,772
Then he walks back into the house and just--

808
01:07:48,772 --> 01:07:50,334
LIAM: Sir.

809
01:07:50,334 --> 01:07:54,769
MATT: He stops a little bit and looks back over
his shoulder towards you.

810
01:07:54,769 --> 01:08:00,194
LIAM: Second chances are a gift. I pray you don't
squander it.

811
01:08:00,194 --> 01:08:07,614
TALIESIN: You're not the first man to panic at the
loss of his shackles. I hope you eventually enjoy

812
01:08:07,614 --> 01:08:13,187
the freedom that you've just been given from your
legacy.

813
01:08:13,187 --> 01:08:20,000
MATT: "Legacy." He continues walking into the
house.

814
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,902
ASHLEY: Sir, may I have your hand, please?

815
01:08:23,902 --> 01:08:32,077
MATT: He stops. "I'm sorry, what?"

816
01:08:32,077 --> 01:08:39,315
ASHLEY: May I have your hand? Not in marriage, I
worded that strangely.

817
01:08:39,315 --> 01:08:41,654
Just your hand that's hurt.

818
01:08:41,654 --> 01:08:48,654
MATT: He's still clutching and hiding it. He gives
you a look of understanding of what you're asking.

819
01:08:48,654 --> 01:08:56,272
"I appreciate the offer, but this needs to heal on
its own."

820
01:08:56,272 --> 01:08:58,623
ASHLEY: Understood.

821
01:08:58,623 --> 01:09:05,700
MATT: "This pain shouldn't be fleeting." And he
walks away inside.

822
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:11,856
TRAVIS: I have a question. Is there any more
stew?

823
01:09:12,039 --> 01:09:15,441
TALIESIN: I don't know.

824
01:09:15,441 --> 01:09:19,391
TRAVIS: My stomach is making noises, I'm so
hungry.

825
01:09:19,391 --> 01:09:22,472
MARISHA: I feel like we could find better stew. No
offense.

826
01:09:22,472 --> 01:09:26,393
LAURA: So...

827
01:09:26,393 --> 01:09:42,739
SAM: Oh, yes. My place is here. I'm coming back to
Whitestone with you, I have to. I have to retrieve

828
01:09:42,739 --> 01:09:45,094
Doty and my personal belongings.

829
01:09:45,094 --> 01:09:47,433
LAURA: But we just finished your room!

830
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:54,004
SAM: Well, I'll come visit. I was thinking, for my
Darrington Brigade, I'll need lots of recruits,

831
01:09:54,004 --> 01:10:01,731
and maybe I could get some down in Whitestone. You
know, fine fighters and young trainees. I even

832
01:10:01,731 --> 01:10:08,850
have an idea for my first adventuring partner. I
think if I sold my old armor, I could afford that

833
01:10:08,850 --> 01:10:14,505
drow for a year, and she lives close by.

834
01:10:14,505 --> 01:10:20,665
TALIESIN: This is a lot.

835
01:10:20,665 --> 01:10:27,431
LIAM: I don't think that's a half-bad idea. We're
all very proud of you.

836
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:29,098
MARISHA: So proud.

837
01:10:29,098 --> 01:10:30,790
TALIESIN: It's very impressive.

838
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:37,264
MARISHA: I understand legacy and responsibility
and I think it's very admirable of you to

839
01:10:37,264 --> 01:10:41,055
recognize your place.

840
01:10:41,055 --> 01:10:51,693
SAM: I've always known that I was not fit to
travel with you all, and I know that you all love

841
01:10:51,693 --> 01:10:59,843
me, but you don't really like me that much. Oh, I
can be kind of a dick sometime.

842
01:10:59,843 --> 01:11:02,492
LAURA: I like it! I like dicks!

843
01:11:02,492 --> 01:11:07,214
MARISHA: A year ago, it was definitely true, but
now...

844
01:11:07,214 --> 01:11:08,671
TRAVIS: What about the bakery?

845
01:11:08,671 --> 01:11:12,553
SAM: Oh, the bakery! I'm really bad at baking
too.

846
01:11:12,553 --> 01:11:14,608
LAURA: No, but you're so good at selling stuff!

847
01:11:14,608 --> 01:11:16,229
SAM: Yeah, I am.

848
01:11:16,229 --> 01:11:21,823
LAURA: I feel like some people come in just to see
you and see you smile.

849
01:11:21,823 --> 01:11:24,765
MARISHA: Yeah, you're definitely the face guy!
You're the good salesman!

850
01:11:24,765 --> 01:11:26,297
SAM: Sure, sure, that makes sense.

851
01:11:26,297 --> 01:11:29,252
MARISHA: You can sell anyone on a shitty cake that
you baked!

852
01:11:29,252 --> 01:11:32,146
SAM: I'll come down and visit a lot.

853
01:11:32,146 --> 01:11:35,465
ASHLEY: What's a lot?

854
01:11:35,465 --> 01:11:42,893
SAM: You know, once every year, around Winter's
Crest. Well, I mean, it's a long way, and I can't

855
01:11:42,893 --> 01:11:44,999
Tree Stride or whatever you call it.

856
01:11:44,999 --> 01:11:46,700
MARISHA: I can come get you.

857
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:51,126
SAM: Listen, let's not do this now. I'm coming
back with you.

858
01:11:51,126 --> 01:11:53,819
I have to go get my robit. All right?

859
01:11:53,819 --> 01:12:00,247
TALIESIN: Well, don't expect us to be okay with
this. That's not going to happen.

860
01:12:00,247 --> 01:12:07,896
MARISHA: I mean, to be fair, Tary does have a
point. I also have a responsibility, and...

861
01:12:07,896 --> 01:12:09,729
SAM: You're leaving, too?

862
01:12:09,729 --> 01:12:11,878
TALIESIN: Yes. Well, technically...

863
01:12:11,878 --> 01:12:13,942
MARISHA: I'm the chief of my people.

864
01:12:13,942 --> 01:12:15,538
SAM: Oh my god, are we all breaking up?

865
01:12:15,538 --> 01:12:17,086
LAURA: What?! No!

866
01:12:17,086 --> 01:12:21,958
ASHLEY: We're not doing this now! What's
happening? What is happening?

867
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:25,627
SAM: I didn't mean to do this! I didn't know this
was going to happen!

868
01:12:25,627 --> 01:12:29,330
TALIESIN: There's no more discussion until there's
food and caffeine. This is madness.

869
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:31,201
ASHLEY: We're just hungry! We're just hungry.

870
01:12:31,201 --> 01:12:33,318
TALIESIN: This is hunger talking.

871
01:12:33,318 --> 01:12:35,837
TRAVIS: We're just feeling hangry as shit.

872
01:12:35,837 --> 01:12:38,308
ASHLEY: Everybody needs to calm down.

873
01:12:38,308 --> 01:12:39,543
TALIESIN: We need brunch.

874
01:12:39,543 --> 01:12:43,674
TRAVIS: All right. We'll get brunch back in
Whitestone, right, and get out of here?

875
01:12:43,674 --> 01:12:48,158
LAURA: Let's go to Whitestone. Let's leave. I
don't like this place anymore.

876
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:55,728
TRAVIS: Let's go, then. You don't say one word.
No, you shut up.

877
01:12:55,728 --> 01:13:00,924
SAM: I need to go say good-bye to Mama, that's it,
then I can go, all right?

878
01:13:00,924 --> 01:13:03,444
TALIESIN: She can come to Whitestone anytime.

879
01:13:03,444 --> 01:13:06,333
SAM: She literally has no money to travel.

880
01:13:06,333 --> 01:13:08,107
TALIESIN: We can make it happen.

881
01:13:08,107 --> 01:13:11,944
TRAVIS: Well, say your goodbyes.

882
01:13:11,944 --> 01:13:13,930
SAM: All right, I'll go find Mom.

883
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:20,148
MATT: She's inside right now. As you walk inside,
she's sitting at the table where everyone had

884
01:13:20,148 --> 01:13:25,015
breakfast, she's eating what was on her plate,
alone. She turns around.

885
01:13:25,015 --> 01:13:32,499
SAM: Mama, I'm sorry to spring all of this on you
and I must go back to Whitestone with my friends,

886
01:13:32,499 --> 01:13:37,261
to tie up some loose ends, but I'll be back soon.
Days, maybe a week.

887
01:13:37,261 --> 01:13:39,360
MATT: "Be back, please."

888
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,582
SAM: In the meantime, though, can you think about
something for me?

889
01:13:42,582 --> 01:13:45,173
MATT: "Of course, what do you need?"

890
01:13:45,173 --> 01:13:57,850
SAM: The charity. Papa and Sister can run it, they
have smarter business acumen than I do, but the

891
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:08,772
brigade, I was wondering if you wanted to do it
with me. You have a taste for adventure, you could

892
01:14:08,772 --> 01:14:15,972
help be our manager! Tend to us when we're
injured...

893
01:14:15,972 --> 01:14:19,525
MATT: "Taryon, I'm far too old for adventure."

894
01:14:19,525 --> 01:14:30,576
SAM: I don't think that's true!

895
01:14:30,576 --> 01:14:32,356
MATT: "As an organizer?"

896
01:14:32,356 --> 01:14:44,564
SAM: Yes, yes! Remember in Escape from Brave
Mountain? Remember the kindly old wizard who

897
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:52,485
stayed back and tended to the injured and fed them
when they were sick with that mystical plague that

898
01:14:52,485 --> 01:15:04,604
they got? You could be that old-- Yes. Think about
it. Read the book again.

899
01:15:04,604 --> 01:15:08,721
And when I come back, we'll talk.

900
01:15:08,721 --> 01:15:18,629
MATT: "All right. But if you're going out and
you're coming back, and I'm to help,

901
01:15:18,629 --> 01:15:22,172
"bring back a better outfit."

902
01:15:22,172 --> 01:15:26,338
SAM: Okay! Do you have a color in mind?

903
01:15:26,338 --> 01:15:31,534
MATT: "Royal blue."

904
01:15:31,534 --> 01:15:35,876
SAM: On it. I give her a big hug.

905
01:15:35,876 --> 01:15:39,153
MATT: She gives you a big hug. As she hugs you,
her mouth gets near your ear and she goes,

906
01:15:39,153 --> 01:15:43,736
"I'm glad you listened."

907
01:15:43,736 --> 01:15:51,402
SAM: Me too. Mama, this is going to be fun, fun,
fun!

908
01:15:51,402 --> 01:15:57,622
MATT: She sniffles a bit and pushes you away. "Now
go, go! Hurry back! Be safe!"

909
01:15:57,622 --> 01:16:00,949
SAM: Maybe! All right, let's go.

910
01:16:00,949 --> 01:16:05,134
TRAVIS: Do we assume the form of clouds?

911
01:16:05,134 --> 01:16:10,573
MARISHA: Oh, no, this is probably a Tree Stride
situation. Let's do that.

912
01:16:10,573 --> 01:16:15,860
TALIESIN: It would have been a very long cloud
stride. Is it even possible to cloud stride?

913
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:18,078
MATT: It's possible, it's just going to be a long
journey.

914
01:16:18,078 --> 01:16:19,477
LAURA: Tree Stride!

915
01:16:19,477 --> 01:16:22,736
MATT: Transport Via Plants. Tree Stride is a very
different spell.

916
01:16:22,736 --> 01:16:25,065
MARISHA: Whatever, that one. Sorry, that's the
fifth level one.

917
01:16:25,065 --> 01:16:27,282
The sixth level teleport... transport...

918
01:16:27,282 --> 01:16:30,033
MATT: I know what you mean, but I was opting for
clarification. Transport Via Plants.

919
01:16:30,033 --> 01:16:31,347
I know what you mean.

920
01:16:31,347 --> 01:16:33,399
MARISHA: It is. Tree Stride just rolls off the
tongue easier.

921
01:16:33,399 --> 01:16:34,783
MATT: I know it does.

922
01:16:34,783 --> 01:16:36,754
TALIESIN: Plant Walk. Tree Trip.

923
01:16:36,754 --> 01:16:38,689
MARISHA: Tree Uber.

924
01:16:38,689 --> 01:16:40,888
TALIESIN: Treecycle.

925
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:43,009
Leaft.

926
01:16:43,009 --> 01:16:46,297
LIAM: Sorry, pull the plug, people, wrap it up.

927
01:16:46,297 --> 01:16:54,411
MATT: You find the nearest large tree and with a
quick snap of your fingers, a flash of druidic

928
01:16:54,411 --> 01:17:00,376
energy, you watch as the tree form splits open,
revealing the doorway. On the other side, the main

929
01:17:00,376 --> 01:17:05,982
thoroughfare of Whitestone. You step through and
find yourself back in your home city.

930
01:17:05,982 --> 01:17:13,140
MARISHA: On the way out, I give the Sun Tree our
secret handshake.

931
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:14,526
TRAVIS: Like, a judo strike?

932
01:17:14,526 --> 01:17:16,223
SAM: You just killed the tree.

933
01:17:16,223 --> 01:17:20,536
LIAM: Quivering Palm the Sun Tree.

934
01:17:20,536 --> 01:17:24,179
TALIESIN: Sun Tree is still doing it the first
time, three years ago.

935
01:17:24,179 --> 01:17:27,129
MARISHA: It's so slow.

936
01:17:27,129 --> 01:17:33,493
MATT: You knock on the Sun Tree a little bit,
continue walking. First thing that catches your

937
01:17:33,493 --> 01:17:41,297
attention, the main square of Whitestone, largely
around the Sun Tree, is fairly empty except for a

938
01:17:41,297 --> 01:17:45,634
few carts. It's mostly for traversing. There's a
small garden that's in the early stages of being

939
01:17:45,634 --> 01:17:51,524
set around. As you walk into the main area, you
notice that there's a lot of carts that are

940
01:17:51,524 --> 01:17:59,414
circling the north end of it, like a small caravan
of sorts. You see a series of wagons, some horses

941
01:17:59,414 --> 01:18:05,841
that are tied off at a couple of hitching posts off
to the side, and you see what appear to be tents

942
01:18:05,841 --> 01:18:12,623
and tables with various wares for sale. Fruits,
vegetables, some exotic cloths and tapestries,

943
01:18:12,623 --> 01:18:14,877
clothing available.

944
01:18:14,877 --> 01:18:16,271
LIAM: Is this a festival?

945
01:18:16,271 --> 01:18:17,755
LAURA: Traveling salesmen?

946
01:18:17,755 --> 01:18:22,003
TALIESIN: My god, it's a shopping episode! I'm so
excited! Just appeared out of nowhere!

947
01:18:22,003 --> 01:18:25,279
SAM: Do they have something in royal blue?

948
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:29,339
TALIESIN: We're going to buy so many imaginary
things, Travis.

949
01:18:29,339 --> 01:18:31,937
MARISHA: What's happening though, really?

950
01:18:31,937 --> 01:18:33,943
TALIESIN: No, really, what is happening?

951
01:18:33,943 --> 01:18:39,095
MATT: You don't recognize any of these people,
necessarily. There's no reason, there's no

952
01:18:39,095 --> 01:18:44,621
calendar element to it. As you walk up, one of the
nearest Pale Guard is doing a walk-through.

953
01:18:44,621 --> 01:18:47,248
TALIESIN: What's this all about?

954
01:18:47,248 --> 01:18:53,340
MATT: "Percival. Now that the trade routes are
open, we're having

955
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:55,571
"more caravans to and from Emon."

956
01:18:55,571 --> 01:18:57,630
MARISHA: It's a farmer's market!

957
01:18:57,630 --> 01:19:01,511
MATT: "Essentially. We're just keeping the
peace."

958
01:19:01,511 --> 01:19:05,440
TALIESIN: It's been several years. Why you should
be even vaguely surprised by this reaction is

959
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,921
baffling to me.

960
01:19:06,921 --> 01:19:09,979
MATT: "It's baffling that you are so comfortable
with it still."

961
01:19:09,979 --> 01:19:13,528
TALIESIN: Excellent, carry on, keep shopping.

962
01:19:13,528 --> 01:19:14,996
MATT: "Of course, of course."

963
01:19:14,996 --> 01:19:17,039
TALIESIN: It's a farmer's market.

964
01:19:17,039 --> 01:19:18,277
MARISHA: Hi!

965
01:19:18,277 --> 01:19:24,295
MATT: He walks off. Do you guys want to walk
around?

966
01:19:24,295 --> 01:19:26,546
TALIESIN: There's a farmer's market!

967
01:19:26,546 --> 01:19:30,808
MARISHA: I need some fresh halibut right now!

968
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:33,639
SAM: Are they selling or are they just setting
up?

969
01:19:33,639 --> 01:19:41,618
MATT: At this time they're selling. You see some
of the populace has come out. You see delicious

970
01:19:41,618 --> 01:19:47,541
fruits, some swamp roots, there are some herbal
setups that have things that are from Stillben and

971
01:19:47,541 --> 01:19:49,548
things that are not indigenous to the Whitestone
area.

972
01:19:49,548 --> 01:19:51,579
LIAM: Are there heirloom tomatoes?

973
01:19:51,579 --> 01:19:54,337
MATT: Make an investigation check.

974
01:19:54,337 --> 01:19:56,653
LIAM: I'm going to use Luck. No I'm not, I'm
kidding.

975
01:19:56,653 --> 01:19:59,213
MATT: Best Luck use ever.

976
01:19:59,213 --> 01:20:04,063
TALIESIN: I think they're all heirloom tomatoes.
There's no such thing.

977
01:20:04,063 --> 01:20:15,614
MATT: You find some nice tomatoes. They're real
tasty-looking tomatoes. There's one oddities shop

978
01:20:15,614 --> 01:20:24,136
that has small baubles and little jewelry,
trinkets that they have for sale. There's a lot of

979
01:20:24,136 --> 01:20:29,898
dried meats. There's no fresh fish because a lot
of the fishing that's done locally doesn't travel

980
01:20:29,898 --> 01:20:31,688
very well on caravan.

981
01:20:31,688 --> 01:20:34,823
MARISHA: Is there flowers? Is there a flower
shop?

982
01:20:34,823 --> 01:20:40,577
MATT: There is no flower shop on the caravan.
There is a flower shop in Whitestone, but you

983
01:20:40,577 --> 01:20:43,498
don't really travel to bring flowers, they don't
keep very well.

984
01:20:43,498 --> 01:20:46,414
TALIESIN: I assume the castle's going to be doing
a run of this anyway,

985
01:20:46,414 --> 01:20:48,102
but I want to see the trinkets.

986
01:20:48,102 --> 01:20:56,036
MATT: You walk up and you see a number of
delightful things. You see a small rack of various

987
01:20:56,036 --> 01:21:05,414
glass vials with various-colored liquids inside.
Some of them seem to be swirling. As you walk up,

988
01:21:05,414 --> 01:21:11,705
you see this gentleman in his early 40s, this long
handlebar mustache that curls past the edges of his

989
01:21:11,705 --> 01:21:19,058
jaw, his hair is combed over to one side and
slicked down. As you approach he's like, "Oh, hi!

990
01:21:19,058 --> 01:21:32,469
"Yes, I've heard of you, you're Vox Machina! Well,
if there's a team looking for the things I have to

991
01:21:32,469 --> 01:21:34,188
"sell, it would be you!"

992
01:21:34,188 --> 01:21:36,520
SAM: He's day-drunk.

993
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:42,411
MATT: "Now." He immediately goes into his spiel.
You watch as some of the other carts nearby begin

994
01:21:42,411 --> 01:21:49,536
to roll their eyes a little bit. "So! Vox Machina.
First off, how do I do the pleasure?"

995
01:21:49,536 --> 01:21:52,787
TALIESIN: Quite impressively, actually.

996
01:21:52,787 --> 01:21:58,221
MATT: "Theobold Cans, by the way. That's my name.
Keep it in mind. Theobold Cans."

997
01:21:58,221 --> 01:22:03,873
MARISHA: Like the festival. Yeah. Just go with
it.

998
01:22:03,873 --> 01:22:08,350
TALIESIN: The Theobold festival, it's very
popular.

999
01:22:08,350 --> 01:22:14,182
MATT: "I have here acquired a few interesting
things that may help you on your journeys. Here."

1000
01:22:14,182 --> 01:22:22,330
He pulls out one of the vials and swirls it for a
second. It has an orange-ish, yellow-ish color to

1001
01:22:22,330 --> 01:22:29,761
it, and as it flows around its side, it has a
thick movement to it, like a syrup. "This liquid,

1002
01:22:29,761 --> 01:22:37,954
"upon being imbibed, will temporarily allow you to
see, read, and speak any language you like!"

1003
01:22:37,954 --> 01:22:40,641
TALIESIN: That's very impressive.

1004
01:22:40,641 --> 01:22:46,869
MATT: "Isn't it, though? So I'll put that one
aside as a possible, yes."

1005
01:22:46,869 --> 01:22:49,353
LIAM: Is that for real, that one?

1006
01:22:49,353 --> 01:22:53,543
SAM: Oh, yes, I should Identify that. I'll
Identify that.

1007
01:22:53,543 --> 01:22:56,691
MATT: You glance over and take a moment to
concentrate. Yes, it is a Potion of Tongues.

1008
01:22:56,691 --> 01:23:00,178
SAM: Okay, great. Thank you for reminding me that
I do that.

1009
01:23:00,178 --> 01:23:06,938
MATT: "Now, these, you might be interested in." He
pulls out what appears to be a set of goggles with

1010
01:23:06,938 --> 01:23:14,766
these thick crystal lenses in the front. "Now,
these, these fit over your eyes, and upon

1011
01:23:14,766 --> 01:23:23,844
"activation, they have the chance of dazzling
somebody and calling them a friend for some time.

1012
01:23:23,844 --> 01:23:41,289
"So. In the maybe pile? This is--" At this point, in the
middle of this conversation, you specifically,

1013
01:23:41,432 --> 01:23:46,801
Vex, you glance over your shoulder as you see the
crowd parting off to the side. There's a large

1014
01:23:46,801 --> 01:23:49,460
figure beelining in your direction.

1015
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:53,035
LAURA: I nudge my brother.

1016
01:23:53,035 --> 01:23:56,731
LIAM: What the hell?

1017
01:23:56,731 --> 01:23:58,614
LAURA: I head-nudge him.

1018
01:23:58,614 --> 01:24:04,694
MATT: You glance over and you see the crowd's being
parted. You see a seven-foot-tall, not quite

1019
01:24:04,694 --> 01:24:12,000
Grog-level but comparable imposing figure, coming
right towards you. You see darker olive skin,

1020
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:18,451
appears to be a set of half-plate armor, no
sleeves, just plate on the chest and on the legs.

1021
01:24:18,451 --> 01:24:26,355
You see short hair that's buzzed on the sides with
a curl of dark in the front, a Superman S curl in

1022
01:24:26,355 --> 01:24:32,952
the front. You see a big broad smile, a tusked
smile. You see orcish blood in this figure as it

1023
01:24:32,952 --> 01:24:35,425
approaches with a big sword across the back.

1024
01:24:35,425 --> 01:24:38,453
LIAM: I take an instinctive step forward, just a
half step in front of Vex.

1025
01:24:38,453 --> 01:24:42,490
TRAVIS: Maybe he'll kill us and we don't have to
shop anymore.

1026
01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:51,366
MATT: As the figure rushes up, apparently drawn by
the sound of the phrase 'Vox Machina'...

1027
01:24:51,366 --> 01:25:00,391
(cheering)

1028
01:25:00,391 --> 01:25:03,105
SAM: No one can see you.

1029
01:25:03,105 --> 01:25:06,542
LAURA: We know it's there, though!

1030
01:25:06,542 --> 01:25:11,651
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1031
01:25:11,651 --> 01:25:17,234
JON: There's an enchantment on it. It's actually
this big.

1032
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:23,880
SAM: Oh god. Oh god! Much, much bigger than
Hardwick!

1033
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:30,183
(laughter)

1034
01:25:30,235 --> 01:25:36,138
MATT: So, as you have been in the process of
specifically keeping an eye out for a group of

1035
01:25:36,138 --> 01:25:44,199
individuals, specifically looking out for the name
or any mention of Vox Machina, you've spent a

1036
01:25:44,199 --> 01:25:48,040
number of hours with no luck, frustrated. But
you've made some friends in talking around, and

1037
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:52,335
then suddenly you hear someone shout the name from
a distance. You glance over and see a cluster of

1038
01:25:52,335 --> 01:25:57,312
individuals that match the descriptions you were
given. You immediately beeline up to them. You

1039
01:25:57,312 --> 01:26:02,203
watch as two similar-looking half-elves spin and
give you the evil eye.

1040
01:26:02,203 --> 01:26:05,315
LIAM: Hey, friend.

1041
01:26:05,315 --> 01:26:06,840
JON: Hi!

1042
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:11,341
LIAM: You look like you're headed this way, did
you need something?

1043
01:26:11,341 --> 01:26:20,367
JON: Yes. I'm looking for some help.

1044
01:26:20,367 --> 01:26:23,548
LAURA: Oh, wow, yeah? What kind of help?

1045
01:26:23,548 --> 01:26:26,173
LIAM: With you so far.

1046
01:26:26,173 --> 01:26:37,502
JON: I'm with a group of these guys and we have a
bit of a problem back in our homeland.

1047
01:26:37,502 --> 01:26:39,984
LIAM: Which is where?

1048
01:26:39,984 --> 01:26:45,228
JON: I have a problem with memory.

1049
01:26:45,228 --> 01:26:48,261
LAURA: Do you remember your name?

1050
01:26:48,261 --> 01:26:51,116
TALIESIN: The phrase 'day-drinking' has already
come up today.

1051
01:26:51,116 --> 01:26:57,710
JON: Well, my name is Lionel Gayheart, but most
people call me Chod.

1052
01:26:57,710 --> 01:26:59,805
ALL: Chod.

1053
01:26:59,805 --> 01:27:04,776
JON: Although, that was my born name, but I call
myself Lionel Gayheart, it's a better name.

1054
01:27:04,776 --> 01:27:06,285
LAURA: It's a much better name.

1055
01:27:06,285 --> 01:27:09,179
LIAM: On the end is '-hard' or '-heart'?

1056
01:27:09,179 --> 01:27:10,526
JON: Gayheart.

1057
01:27:10,526 --> 01:27:12,277
LIAM: Heart.

1058
01:27:12,277 --> 01:27:13,925
TRAVIS: People call him Chode.

1059
01:27:13,925 --> 01:27:15,252
MARISHA: Chode.

1060
01:27:15,252 --> 01:27:16,573
TALIESIN: Lionel.

1061
01:27:16,573 --> 01:27:17,849
LIAM: Right.

1062
01:27:17,849 --> 01:27:26,914
JON: But, so, yeah, we've been having some
problems and we need some help.

1063
01:27:26,914 --> 01:27:29,989
TRAVIS: What kind of problems?

1064
01:27:29,989 --> 01:27:34,026
LIAM: Like opening a peanut butter jar, or how
big?

1065
01:27:34,026 --> 01:27:36,971
LAURA: Or, like, dragon kind of issue?

1066
01:27:36,971 --> 01:27:46,968
JON: Well... More like creepy guys in a big group
issue. I'm with this guy, you guys, you've heard

1067
01:27:46,968 --> 01:27:51,511
of, he's pretty big in our parts...

1068
01:27:51,511 --> 01:27:53,439
you've heard
of the Meat Man?

1069
01:27:53,439 --> 01:27:56,552
(gasping)

1070
01:27:56,552 --> 01:27:57,507
MARISHA: What?!

1071
01:27:57,507 --> 01:27:58,899
TRAVIS: Are you fucking shitting me?!

1072
01:27:58,899 --> 01:27:59,870
LAURA: You!

1073
01:27:59,870 --> 01:28:01,004
JON: You guys know him?

1074
01:28:01,004 --> 01:28:02,488
TRAVIS: Yeah, we know him.

1075
01:28:02,488 --> 01:28:04,382
JON: I thought he was just big in our parts.

1076
01:28:04,382 --> 01:28:05,652
LAURA: Where are you from?

1077
01:28:05,652 --> 01:28:07,808
TALIESIN: Is this what's happening right now?

1078
01:28:07,808 --> 01:28:09,722
MARISHA: Are we all paying attention at this
point?

1079
01:28:09,722 --> 01:28:12,681
MATT: It's hard to miss this guy show up.

1080
01:28:12,681 --> 01:28:15,160
TALIESIN: Was trying to ignore it. Now I'm
failing.

1081
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:17,356
LAURA: I'm going to throw something again at Sam.

1082
01:28:17,356 --> 01:28:22,074
LIAM: Is Shorthalt around right now? Is this a
prank? Is that was this is? Is this a joke?

1083
01:28:22,074 --> 01:28:24,485
JON: I don't know jokes.

1084
01:28:24,485 --> 01:28:26,324
LIAM: Insight check.

1085
01:28:26,324 --> 01:28:27,585
MATT: Insight check.

1086
01:28:27,585 --> 01:28:35,949
LIAM: It's fine. No, it's not fine. That's better.
14.

1087
01:28:35,949 --> 01:28:44,881
MATT: He seems pretty lost on the name Shorthalt,
but seems to be upfront with his intent.

1088
01:28:44,881 --> 01:28:48,574
MARISHA: So, wait, he does know jokes, or he does
know the Meat Man?

1089
01:28:48,574 --> 01:28:50,367
JON: I know the Meat Man.

1090
01:28:50,367 --> 01:28:51,701
MARISHA: But you don't know jokes?

1091
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:53,011
JON: I don't know jokes.

1092
01:28:53,011 --> 01:28:54,122
ASHLEY: How do you know the Mean Man?

1093
01:28:54,122 --> 01:28:58,054
MARISHA: Do you know Parchment, Boulder, Shears?
Never mind.

1094
01:28:58,054 --> 01:29:03,161
JON: The Meat Man, he's my boss.

1095
01:29:03,161 --> 01:29:04,733
TRAVIS: What? Really?

1096
01:29:04,733 --> 01:29:05,702
JON: Yeah!

1097
01:29:05,702 --> 01:29:10,346
LAURA: Wait, what does he look like? Short guy?

1098
01:29:10,346 --> 01:29:13,836
JON: No, well, he's shorter than me, but, you
know.

1099
01:29:13,836 --> 01:29:17,245
LIAM: Where on yourself does he come?

1100
01:29:17,245 --> 01:29:18,849
LAURA: Is he this size?

1101
01:29:18,849 --> 01:29:20,151
SAM: She's a gnome.

1102
01:29:20,151 --> 01:29:22,560
JON: No, no, he's bigger than that.

1103
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:23,889
LIAM: Excuse me?

1104
01:29:23,889 --> 01:29:24,909
MARISHA: What?!

1105
01:29:24,909 --> 01:29:28,279
JON: It's the Meat Man, you guys seem familiar
with him, you know what he looks like.

1106
01:29:28,279 --> 01:29:30,863
TRAVIS: Is this the Meat Man we know?

1107
01:29:30,863 --> 01:29:33,442
MATT: No, not at all!

1108
01:29:33,442 --> 01:29:35,195
MARISHA: Is he pulling a Dread Pirate Roberts?

1109
01:29:35,195 --> 01:29:37,452
TRAVIS: He's not the Meat Man that we know.

1110
01:29:37,452 --> 01:29:39,643
LAURA: Well, we don't know, maybe it is! Where are
you from?

1111
01:29:39,643 --> 01:29:41,659
MARISHA: Does he wear a beret?

1112
01:29:41,659 --> 01:29:50,380
JON: I'm from an area where-- we're from the
desert. It's like a desert area. We've traveled

1113
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:55,199
across a very, very far way. It was a long
journey.

1114
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:56,733
LAURA and MARISHA: Marquet?

1115
01:29:56,733 --> 01:29:57,656
JON: No.

1116
01:29:57,656 --> 01:29:58,871
LIAM: Did you cross the ocean to get here?

1117
01:29:58,871 --> 01:30:02,080
JON: Yes, we crossed the ocean. We were on those
wooden things that have, like--

1118
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:03,052
LAURA: The ships?

1119
01:30:03,052 --> 01:30:04,603
JON: Yeah, ships! That's it!

1120
01:30:04,603 --> 01:30:07,182
MARISHA: Ank'harel? Bigger than Marquet.
Ank'harel?

1121
01:30:07,182 --> 01:30:08,383
JON: Ank'harel!

1122
01:30:08,383 --> 01:30:10,531
MARISHA: (gasps) We're getting closer! Oh my god!

1123
01:30:10,531 --> 01:30:14,407
LIAM: Is your boss with you right now? Did he come
with you or did he send you?

1124
01:30:14,407 --> 01:30:20,358
JON: No, I'm with him, well, he said he was around
here somewhere.

1125
01:30:20,358 --> 01:30:23,705
LIAM: Shut the <i>fuck</i> up! He's here right now?

1126
01:30:23,705 --> 01:30:26,003
JON: Why, is that bad or good?

1127
01:30:26,003 --> 01:30:27,649
TRAVIS: No, real good. Real good thing.

1128
01:30:27,649 --> 01:30:29,236
JON: It's a real good thing?

1129
01:30:29,236 --> 01:30:30,965
LAURA: But will you bring us to him?

1130
01:30:30,965 --> 01:30:37,436
JON: Yeah, I need your help. We need your help!
I'm kind of his messenger,

1131
01:30:37,436 --> 01:30:39,494
I was supposed to find some--

1132
01:30:39,494 --> 01:30:42,089
TALIESIN: This is your first time being a
messenger, is it?

1133
01:30:42,089 --> 01:30:45,165
MATT: "I don't mean any offense, here, but I was
in the middle of a transaction,

1134
01:30:45,165 --> 01:30:47,762
"if you don't mind, sir?!"

1135
01:30:47,762 --> 01:30:52,749
MARISHA: We'll take the Tongues potion. How much?
Come on, give it to me.

1136
01:30:52,749 --> 01:30:56,826
MATT: "7,000 gold pieces."

1137
01:30:56,826 --> 01:30:59,523
MARISHA: What?! I don't have that much!

1138
01:30:59,523 --> 01:31:04,220
ASHLEY: What was the third one, though?

1139
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:07,312
MATT: "The third one?"

1140
01:31:07,312 --> 01:31:10,733
LAURA: The one you were about to say. We were
going to hear you say it before--

1141
01:31:10,733 --> 01:31:12,428
TALIESIN: Before you were so strangely
interrupted.

1142
01:31:12,428 --> 01:31:15,486
ASHLEY: This is very important, but...

1143
01:31:15,486 --> 01:31:16,969
TALIESIN: You didn't have it, did you?

1144
01:31:16,969 --> 01:31:18,330
MATT: "There's a ring."

1145
01:31:18,330 --> 01:31:19,540
TRAVIS: A ring?

1146
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:20,516
MATT: "A ring."

1147
01:31:20,516 --> 01:31:21,570
TRAVIS: What does it do?

1148
01:31:21,570 --> 01:31:23,392
MATT: "Allows you to move freely."

1149
01:31:23,392 --> 01:31:24,906
MARISHA: Is it under a thousand gold?

1150
01:31:24,906 --> 01:31:25,877
MATT: "No!"

1151
01:31:25,877 --> 01:31:27,366
MARISHA: Then goodbye!

1152
01:31:27,366 --> 01:31:28,829
LIAM: We're moving, we're moving.

1153
01:31:28,829 --> 01:31:30,018
MATT: "Gaaah!"

1154
01:31:30,018 --> 01:31:32,006
MARISHA: We're getting out of his store front.

1155
01:31:32,006 --> 01:31:34,570
LAURA: Wait, Chod! Chod!

1156
01:31:34,570 --> 01:31:35,844
TRAVIS: Chode.

1157
01:31:35,844 --> 01:31:37,074
TALIESIN: Lionel.

1158
01:31:37,074 --> 01:31:44,630
JON: Chod. But please call me Lionel.

1159
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:46,154
LIAM: Oh, you prefer Lionel!

1160
01:31:46,154 --> 01:31:47,278
JON: Yes, of course!

1161
01:31:47,278 --> 01:31:48,736
LAURA: Lionel's way better.

1162
01:31:48,736 --> 01:31:51,306
JON: I probably should have told you my real name.
It's Lionel.

1163
01:31:51,306 --> 01:31:58,214
MARISHA: Can we call you Lion for short? That's
fierce! I'm Keyleth.

1164
01:31:58,214 --> 01:32:01,727
JON: I might get confused if you call me Lion,
though, I'm just warning you ahead of time.

1165
01:32:01,727 --> 01:32:03,496
MARISHA: Keyleth. Nice to meet you.

1166
01:32:03,496 --> 01:32:06,412
TALIESIN: I have a feeling you're going to get
confused even if we call you Lionel. It's Percival,

1167
01:32:06,476 --> 01:32:08,411
it's a pleasure, Chod. Hello.

1168
01:32:08,411 --> 01:32:09,669
JON: Hello!

1169
01:32:09,669 --> 01:32:11,507
SAM: Taryon Darrington!

1170
01:32:11,507 --> 01:32:12,984
JON: You're a fancy lad.

1171
01:32:12,984 --> 01:32:15,566
LAURA: Vax. Vex.

1172
01:32:15,566 --> 01:32:17,378
LIAM: This is going to be difficult.

1173
01:32:17,378 --> 01:32:20,391
LAURA: Just say Vex.

1174
01:32:20,391 --> 01:32:22,900
JON: Vex? And your name's Vex, too?

1175
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:30,311
LIAM: Call her little elf girl, and you can call
me little elf boy. Could we meet your boss?

1176
01:32:30,311 --> 01:32:33,418
TRAVIS: Hold on, Pike had a question.

1177
01:32:33,418 --> 01:32:40,134
ASHLEY: Why is he your boss? What do you do? What
kind of work are you in?

1178
01:32:40,134 --> 01:32:52,193
JON: Oh, you know, we do various things. I round
up-- He likes to make sure everybody's in line

1179
01:32:52,193 --> 01:33:00,932
back in our area. Sometimes he makes me (sighs)
make sure people pay up, and--

1180
01:33:00,932 --> 01:33:02,895
LAURA: So, wait a minute, so he's like a bad guy?

1181
01:33:02,895 --> 01:33:04,041
JON: No, he's a good guy!

1182
01:33:04,041 --> 01:33:09,117
LIAM: Are you a bouncer? Is he playing music and
you're his bouncer? Do you rough up people who try

1183
01:33:09,117 --> 01:33:10,461
to cause trouble?

1184
01:33:10,461 --> 01:33:13,302
JON: Well, you know, in the nicest way possible,
sometimes.

1185
01:33:13,302 --> 01:33:15,012
LIAM: Sure, that's what I do.

1186
01:33:15,012 --> 01:33:17,026
ASHLEY: Do you know someone named Kaylie?

1187
01:33:17,026 --> 01:33:18,738
JON: Kaylie? No.

1188
01:33:18,738 --> 01:33:21,391
LAURA: But do you know a girl that looks kind of
like the Meat Man?

1189
01:33:21,391 --> 01:33:25,687
JON: I don't talk to many girls. Oh, you're a
girl! I'm sorry.

1190
01:33:25,687 --> 01:33:27,213
Well, I'm talking to you, that's awesome!

1191
01:33:27,213 --> 01:33:29,441
LAURA: Hey, that's great!

1192
01:33:29,441 --> 01:33:44,994
JON: That might be a first. I forgot, so, I wasn't
supposed to call him Meat Man. In these areas,

1193
01:33:44,994 --> 01:33:53,714
he's known as Aes Adon. I think that's what he
said.

1194
01:33:53,714 --> 01:33:58,138
LAURA: Aes Adon? But he's actually the Meat Man.

1195
01:33:58,138 --> 01:33:59,964
JON: Maybe.

1196
01:33:59,964 --> 01:34:02,296
LIAM: So we get to meet the Meat Man?

1197
01:34:02,296 --> 01:34:08,178
JON: Yeah, we need your help. But I'm just
checking you guys out first because he said I'm a

1198
01:34:08,178 --> 01:34:09,727
real good judge of character.

1199
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:13,270
LAURA: And what do you think? What do you judge on
us?

1200
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:15,421
JON: Oh, you guys seem really nice.

1201
01:34:15,421 --> 01:34:18,049
LAURA: You seem really great, too. You should
probably take us to him, then.

1202
01:34:18,049 --> 01:34:22,332
JON: Yeah! It's nice to have to, you know, go do
something with people

1203
01:34:22,332 --> 01:34:23,858
where I don't have to hurt them.

1204
01:34:23,858 --> 01:34:27,178
LAURA: Yeah! We feel the same way sometimes.

1205
01:34:27,178 --> 01:34:29,107
ASHLEY: So he didn't send you here to hurt us?

1206
01:34:29,107 --> 01:34:30,121
JON: No, no.

1207
01:34:30,121 --> 01:34:31,469
ASHLEY: Just to come.

1208
01:34:31,469 --> 01:34:34,230
JON: Yeah, well, we need to enlist your help.

1209
01:34:34,230 --> 01:34:45,162
MARISHA: Hang on a second. Will you earmuffs? He
knows what earmuffs are! That's good. Anyway, why

1210
01:34:45,312 --> 01:34:52,061
would Scanlan send a messenger? He has the gate
stone! And why him?

1211
01:34:52,061 --> 01:34:53,912
Scanlan's smarter than that, right?

1212
01:34:53,912 --> 01:34:56,939
LAURA: Maybe Scanlan's trying to play us and he
accidentally sent someone that--

1213
01:34:56,939 --> 01:34:58,196
MARISHA: Chode?

1214
01:34:58,196 --> 01:34:59,350
TALIESIN: Lionel!

1215
01:34:59,350 --> 01:35:02,948
TRAVIS: Aes Adon. I don't think it's Scanlan.

1216
01:35:02,948 --> 01:35:04,598
LAURA: It's got to be Scanlan.

1217
01:35:04,598 --> 01:35:08,064
MARISHA: Look, a lot of people could go by the
alter-ego Meat Man.

1218
01:35:08,064 --> 01:35:10,594
LAURA: What other weirdo would name themselves Meat
Man?

1219
01:35:10,632 --> 01:35:11,733
MARISHA: Good point.

1220
01:35:11,733 --> 01:35:15,571
TALIESIN: I'm also going to put out there that we
all know we're going to go do this because we're

1221
01:35:15,571 --> 01:35:19,603
desperate for anything to put off the inevitable
goodbyes that we were heading towards. So let's

1222
01:35:19,754 --> 01:35:21,827
distract ourselves for a little bit.

1223
01:35:21,827 --> 01:35:24,229
LIAM: And, fucking Scanlan!

1224
01:35:24,229 --> 01:35:25,938
TALIESIN: We'll see.

1225
01:35:25,938 --> 01:35:29,232
MARISHA: Look, he's still doing it! He does follow
directions well.

1226
01:35:29,232 --> 01:35:30,254
LAURA: Lionel!

1227
01:35:30,254 --> 01:35:31,750
TALIESIN: If I were to trick us, that's how I
would trick us.

1228
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:32,797
MARISHA: Lionel.

1229
01:35:32,797 --> 01:35:39,938
JON: What? Oh, I was having such a nice story in
my head. What is it? What do you guys want?

1230
01:35:39,938 --> 01:35:44,718
LIAM: You are very likeable. Do you have problems
talking to people? To women, even?

1231
01:35:44,718 --> 01:35:49,457
JONL No, no, I'm really good at talking to myself
sometimes. That's where I get most practice.

1232
01:35:49,457 --> 01:35:50,937
LIAM: It shows.

1233
01:35:50,937 --> 01:35:52,619
TALIESIN: Quite a bit of practice.

1234
01:35:52,619 --> 01:35:54,160
LIAM: Let's meet this chap!

1235
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:55,957
JON: Yeah, let's go meet him.

1236
01:35:55,957 --> 01:36:08,951
MATT: You watch as you're led by this lumbering
oaf of a half-orc who has a spring in his step and

1237
01:36:08,951 --> 01:36:16,171
a perpetual smile. Everyone around just can't help
but watch him as he goes. He exudes this natural

1238
01:36:16,171 --> 01:36:24,593
force of personality in spite of himself. People
are enthralled or spooked or just trying to figure

1239
01:36:24,593 --> 01:36:31,265
out what the heck this individual is that's now
talking and walking with a very confused-looking

1240
01:36:31,265 --> 01:36:38,930
Vox Machina. He leads you along to the southern
side of Whitestone, talking about his tales of

1241
01:36:38,930 --> 01:36:48,500
growing up around Ank'harel and Marquet. Any other
tales he wishes to express along the way. But,

1242
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:55,834
eventually, leads you to one of the inns in the
south side of the city. The interior is empty.

1243
01:36:55,834 --> 01:37:04,323
There is nobody in there. It is just devoid of any
people working there. You recall, because you were

1244
01:37:04,323 --> 01:37:06,610
told to pay everybody to leave.

1245
01:37:06,610 --> 01:37:14,139
JON: Yeah. But he was here, so, yeah. I don't
know, you guys, like,

1246
01:37:14,139 --> 01:37:16,263
make yourselves comfortable.

1247
01:37:16,263 --> 01:37:19,860
LIAM: This is the craziest 48 hours, I swear to
all the gods.

1248
01:37:20,009 --> 01:37:27,086
JON: It's cool. Aes Adon has the best mutton. He
keeps it normally-- I don't think I made the

1249
01:37:27,086 --> 01:37:29,960
mutton leave, so you can check the drawers.

1250
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:31,677
LAURA: I go search the drawers.

1251
01:37:31,677 --> 01:37:33,099
SAM: In drawers?

1252
01:37:33,099 --> 01:37:35,366
LAURA: Yeah! I start searching.

1253
01:37:35,366 --> 01:37:37,241
SAM: I'm not going to eat any mutton from
drawers.

1254
01:37:37,241 --> 01:37:39,189
LAURA: He gave me free rein, I'm searching this
fucking place.

1255
01:37:39,189 --> 01:37:45,475
MATT: You start pulling through the drawers. There
is a piece of mutton in there. You get the sense

1256
01:37:45,475 --> 01:37:50,882
that it wasn't stored there, more than maybe
it was half-eaten and left there for later.

1257
01:37:50,882 --> 01:37:55,481
TALIESIN: 25 perception, I don't know, I'm just
looking around.

1258
01:37:55,481 --> 01:37:57,441
LIAM: I'm looking for weirdness and traps.

1259
01:37:57,441 --> 01:37:59,984
MATT: Okay. Make investigation checks, you guys.

1260
01:37:59,984 --> 01:38:03,142
LIAM: 24.

1261
01:38:03,142 --> 01:38:04,615
TALIESIN: No.

1262
01:38:04,615 --> 01:38:06,844
LAURA: Should I be investigating, too?

1263
01:38:06,844 --> 01:38:09,777
MATT: Sure. So, what'd you get?

1264
01:38:09,777 --> 01:38:11,736
SAM: Ten.

1265
01:38:11,736 --> 01:38:12,887
MARISHA: Not good.

1266
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:14,021
LIAM: 24.

1267
01:38:14,021 --> 01:38:16,086
LAURA: 11.

1268
01:38:16,086 --> 01:38:17,129
TALIESIN: 13.

1269
01:38:17,129 --> 01:38:28,366
MATT: You find the partially eaten mutton. Vax,
you find the tavern has many drinks on tap, it has

1270
01:38:28,366 --> 01:38:32,233
a number of cups. Looks to be remnants of people
that were possibly eating or finishing a meal that

1271
01:38:32,233 --> 01:38:38,592
quickly left. The coffers for the tavern are
gone.

1272
01:38:38,592 --> 01:38:41,395
LIAM: No traces of poo anywhere?

1273
01:38:41,395 --> 01:38:43,046
MATT: No traces of poo, no.

1274
01:38:43,046 --> 01:38:46,196
LAURA: Scanlan! Scanlan, are you here?

1275
01:38:46,196 --> 01:38:51,033
MATT: You hear footsteps coming down a stairway on
the far end of the tavern.

1276
01:38:51,033 --> 01:38:52,494
JON: Who's Scanlan?

1277
01:38:52,494 --> 01:38:56,108
SAM: He's this really creepy weirdo they always
talk about.

1278
01:38:56,108 --> 01:38:59,838
JON: No, I don't think there's a Scanlan here,
no.

1279
01:38:59,838 --> 01:39:05,412
MATT: You watch as an imposing figure makes his
way down the stairs. As he turns around the

1280
01:39:05,412 --> 01:39:14,173
corner, the light comes in. You see a human man,
very, very tan skin. His body is thick with

1281
01:39:14,173 --> 01:39:20,288
muscles and is imposing by just his stance. His
shoulders are forward a little bit, his fists

1282
01:39:20,288 --> 01:39:25,547
clenched to the side. You see a dark leather vest
that is affixed to the torso and a hood attached

1283
01:39:25,547 --> 01:39:31,765
that hides elements of his appearance. But you do
see long stringy black hair that cascades out the

1284
01:39:31,765 --> 01:39:40,234
front and as he turns around, you see a very
craggy, pockmarked face adorned by a thick black

1285
01:39:40,234 --> 01:39:47,190
mustache, a deep scar that sits on his face under
one eye, and you see his one hand is rested on

1286
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:54,512
this curved, jeweled dagger that is sheathed on
one side. Turns around (thudding steps) walks over

1287
01:39:54,512 --> 01:40:02,273
to one of the far tables, pulls the chair out,
spins it around, sits in it and rests on it.

1288
01:40:02,273 --> 01:40:09,160
"Welcome, friends. You are Vox Machina, yes?"

1289
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:13,149
LIAM: Who's asking?

1290
01:40:13,149 --> 01:40:19,802
MATT: "Sit down, please. If you don't mind. You
are guests of mine right now."

1291
01:40:19,802 --> 01:40:22,184
SAM: Is this Scanlan?

1292
01:40:22,184 --> 01:40:23,465
TALIESIN: No.

1293
01:40:23,465 --> 01:40:27,914
LAURA: I want to roll a perception, I want to see
if it's an illusion, if it actually is Scanlan.

1294
01:40:27,914 --> 01:40:29,790
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1295
01:40:29,790 --> 01:40:32,884
JON: I told you, I don't--

1296
01:40:32,884 --> 01:40:36,742
MATT: "Chod! Good job." And he flicks you a gold
coin.

1297
01:40:36,742 --> 01:40:37,946
LAURA: 25.

1298
01:40:37,946 --> 01:40:39,369
MATT: 25.

1299
01:40:39,369 --> 01:40:43,297
TRAVIS: What? Oh god! Jesus! Balls!

1300
01:40:43,297 --> 01:40:44,330
SAM: Whispers!

1301
01:40:44,330 --> 01:40:45,493
LIAM: Incoming whisper!

1302
01:40:45,493 --> 01:40:51,032
SAM: The Scanlan Shorthalt t-shirts are available
on the store right now. Travis is wearing one. You

1303
01:40:51,032 --> 01:40:57,120
can see it maybe on your screen. He's doing a
little jig! Boop boop do boop boop! Boop boop! Buy

1304
01:40:57,120 --> 01:40:58,497
your shirts today.

1305
01:40:58,497 --> 01:41:00,306
LIAM: The hottest penguin I ever saw.

1306
01:41:00,477 --> 01:41:09,978
MATT: "My name is Aes Adon."

1307
01:41:09,978 --> 01:41:11,676
JON: Told you.

1308
01:41:11,676 --> 01:41:18,529
MATT: "I'm but a humble merchant from Ank'harel,
and I'm seeking to make some contacts in this

1309
01:41:18,529 --> 01:41:23,896
"rumored emerging metropolis of Whitestone. Yes?"

1310
01:41:23,896 --> 01:41:25,747
TALIESIN: Yes.

1311
01:41:25,747 --> 01:41:36,397
MATT: "Now, I have information that may be of use to
you, my compatriots have told me. And, should my

1312
01:41:36,397 --> 01:41:45,698
"gatherers and whisperers be correct, in trade I
would like to get some information from this one."

1313
01:41:45,698 --> 01:41:50,421
TALIESIN: Possibly. What is it that you want to
know?

1314
01:41:50,421 --> 01:41:56,005
MATT: "Rumors tell me of these fabled Riflemen of
Whitestone."

1315
01:41:56,005 --> 01:41:57,801
TALIESIN: Yes.

1316
01:41:57,801 --> 01:42:08,633
MATT: "While paltry mechanical imitations have
occasionally come across the markets on our side

1317
01:42:08,633 --> 01:42:16,881
"of the world, I hear that you were the designer of
these instruments of death."

1318
01:42:16,881 --> 01:42:18,025
MARISHA: Oh no.

1319
01:42:18,025 --> 01:42:19,425
TALIESIN: I am.

1320
01:42:19,425 --> 01:42:26,201
MATT: "Well, in the intent of expanding my
influence in keeping the peace where I do

1321
01:42:26,201 --> 01:42:37,134
"business, I would like to make a trade. This
important information for you to grant me access

1322
01:42:37,134 --> 01:42:39,139
"to your designs."

1323
01:42:39,139 --> 01:42:47,107
TALIESIN: What is this information? You don't even
need to tell me what it is, but that would be

1324
01:42:47,107 --> 01:42:50,993
worth quite a lot, and what you knew would have to
be worth quite a lot.

1325
01:42:50,993 --> 01:42:52,983
MARISHA: Selling the secret recipe, man.

1326
01:42:52,983 --> 01:43:11,462
MATT: "Let's say that information has come to my
attention regarding a hidden location on Marquet.

1327
01:43:11,462 --> 01:43:14,765
"A compatriot of mine, whom you've already met--"

1328
01:43:14,765 --> 01:43:17,707
JON: (heavy, repeated sniffing)

1329
01:43:17,707 --> 01:43:28,527
MATT: "-- recently returned from an expedition I
sent him on, where he stumbled upon a pyramid."

1330
01:43:28,527 --> 01:43:30,549
TRAVIS: A pyramid?

1331
01:43:30,549 --> 01:43:34,429
MATT: "Yes. Does this pique your interest?"

1332
01:43:34,429 --> 01:43:35,952
MARISHA: Oh no.

1333
01:43:35,952 --> 01:43:39,179
LIAM: Ziggurat.

1334
01:43:39,179 --> 01:43:44,865
MATT: "So, this is the information I have to
offer."

1335
01:43:44,865 --> 01:43:46,752
MARISHA: Wait, he said Marquet, though.

1336
01:43:46,752 --> 01:43:47,894
LAURA: Yeah.

1337
01:43:47,894 --> 01:43:49,565
LIAM: Another one.

1338
01:43:49,565 --> 01:43:51,353
LAURA: Did you go inside of it?

1339
01:43:51,353 --> 01:43:54,897
JON: No. No.

1340
01:43:54,897 --> 01:43:56,523
LAURA: Did you see anybody around?

1341
01:43:56,523 --> 01:43:57,948
SAM: Did you see anything about it?

1342
01:43:57,948 --> 01:43:59,008
JON: Yeah!

1343
01:43:59,008 --> 01:44:04,697
MATT: "I would request you hold that information
until we make a deal."

1344
01:44:04,697 --> 01:44:06,254
JON: Sorry, Aes. Sorry, Aes.

1345
01:44:06,254 --> 01:44:08,454
SAM: No, no, you can go ahead and tell us!

1346
01:44:08,454 --> 01:44:10,537
JON: No, he's my boss.

1347
01:44:10,537 --> 01:44:12,856
LAURA: Does it count if it's a girl that he's
talking to?

1348
01:44:12,856 --> 01:44:14,906
I mean, it's not quite the same, right?

1349
01:44:14,906 --> 01:44:19,704
MATT: "Silence! My deal is with you, Vox
Machina."

1350
01:44:19,704 --> 01:44:23,263
LIAM: You can tell us later.

1351
01:44:23,299 --> 01:44:25,092
TALIESIN: What is this worth?

1352
01:44:25,092 --> 01:44:27,182
JON: You should listen to him.

1353
01:44:27,182 --> 01:44:35,265
MARISHA: I guess it depends on what he thinks it's
worth to us. What makes you think that we want

1354
01:44:35,265 --> 01:44:37,312
this information so much?

1355
01:44:37,312 --> 01:44:46,595
MATT: "I've had a compatriot of yours stumble
through my city seeking information about,

1356
01:44:46,595 --> 01:44:57,236
"apparently, something beneath your city. The
whispers come to me. I saw a connection. From what

1357
01:44:57,236 --> 01:45:04,189
"I hear, you've put quite a bit of energy into this
darkened orb."

1358
01:45:04,189 --> 01:45:16,489
TALIESIN: Well, this leaves me with a bit of a
conundrum. Traditionally, when people come either

1359
01:45:16,489 --> 01:45:22,977
asking to see my designs or if we come across
people who have been attempting to replicate them,

1360
01:45:22,977 --> 01:45:27,874
we just simply have them executed on sight.
Traditionally.

1361
01:45:27,874 --> 01:45:30,691
MATT: "I would not recommend that."

1362
01:45:30,691 --> 01:45:33,963
TALIESIN: Well, if I were going to do it, it would
have already been done, now wouldn't it?

1363
01:45:34,018 --> 01:45:39,585
JON: Well, I don't know about that. Remember.
Enchantment.

1364
01:45:39,585 --> 01:45:44,257
MATT: "Thank you, Chod."

1365
01:45:44,257 --> 01:45:46,176
SAM: I think that was a threat.

1366
01:45:46,176 --> 01:45:49,440
TALIESIN: That was a very good threat!

1367
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:51,666
JON: Really? Was it?

1368
01:45:51,666 --> 01:45:55,672
TALIESIN: It was definitely a strong six.

1369
01:45:55,672 --> 01:46:00,368
LIAM: How'd you hear about this compatriot? How do
we know you're not selling us a song? Who was this

1370
01:46:00,368 --> 01:46:01,634
compatriot of ours?

1371
01:46:01,634 --> 01:46:03,952
LAURA: What?

1372
01:46:03,952 --> 01:46:06,830
LIAM: He said someone came through? He's talking
about this guy?

1373
01:46:06,830 --> 01:46:07,997
MATT: No.

1374
01:46:07,997 --> 01:46:10,394
JON: My name's Lionel, you guys.

1375
01:46:10,394 --> 01:46:14,769
MATT: "I did not meet this individual, but
apparently they belong

1376
01:46:14,769 --> 01:46:17,105
"on the council of your country."

1377
01:46:17,105 --> 01:46:18,303
MARISHA: What?

1378
01:46:18,303 --> 01:46:20,380
LIAM: Little bit more, please.

1379
01:46:20,380 --> 01:46:23,717
MATT: "Blonde of hair. Traverses through arcane
means."

1380
01:46:23,717 --> 01:46:26,358
MARISHA: What? What'd he say?

1381
01:46:26,358 --> 01:46:27,955
LIAM: Man or woman?

1382
01:46:27,955 --> 01:46:31,890
MATT: "Woman. Blonde of hair."

1383
01:46:31,890 --> 01:46:33,260
MARISHA: Allura.

1384
01:46:33,260 --> 01:46:34,330
TALIESIN: Well.

1385
01:46:34,330 --> 01:46:37,066
MARISHA: What is happening?

1386
01:46:37,066 --> 01:46:39,979
TRAVIS: She went to go find information about it,
that's not strange.

1387
01:46:39,979 --> 01:46:41,283
MARISHA: That's not bad, right?

1388
01:46:41,283 --> 01:46:48,005
ASHLEY: What does the Meat Man mean to you?

1389
01:46:48,005 --> 01:46:55,596
MATT: Leans back and you see he takes the dagger
out and spins it a little bit on the fingertip.

1390
01:46:55,596 --> 01:47:08,141
"The Meat Man is before you. I don't know where
you heard this title, but--"

1391
01:47:08,141 --> 01:47:18,602
(laughter)

1392
01:47:18,644 --> 01:47:21,511
JON: I told you guys, it's Aes!

1393
01:47:21,574 --> 01:47:24,340
MATT: "There will be a conversation later."

1394
01:47:24,340 --> 01:47:25,923
LAURA: Oh no!

1395
01:47:25,923 --> 01:47:33,732
MATT: "But that is a business alias of mine that
I've had for a short time."

1396
01:47:33,732 --> 01:47:36,050
ASHLEY: You don't need to get upset with him for
it.

1397
01:47:36,050 --> 01:47:41,803
MARISHA: We had a friend who we thought it
might've been him.

1398
01:47:41,803 --> 01:47:43,498
TRAVIS: Keyleth, stay on task!

1399
01:47:43,498 --> 01:47:44,907
MARISHA: Sorry.

1400
01:47:44,907 --> 01:47:46,778
MATT: "There is no other Meat Man."

1401
01:47:46,778 --> 01:47:51,725
LIAM: It's kind of a sticking point for us. You're
coming to us with one piece of information that we

1402
01:47:51,725 --> 01:47:56,257
may be interested in, but you're accidentally
tipping your hand towards something else that we

1403
01:47:56,257 --> 01:48:05,748
want to know about. We know a Meat Man, and he is
not you.

1404
01:48:05,748 --> 01:48:10,435
ASHLEY: Do you know... the Meat Man?

1405
01:48:10,435 --> 01:48:12,674
LIAM: Do you know the muffin man?

1406
01:48:12,674 --> 01:48:15,976
TALIESIN: This meeting is only happening because
we were hoping to meet our Meat Man.

1407
01:48:15,976 --> 01:48:23,782
MATT: "If you are referring to the small one, he's
been dealt with. The title is now mine."

1408
01:48:23,782 --> 01:48:25,320
TALIESIN: Dealt with.

1409
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:29,893
LIAM: Roll back a step or two. Dealt with how?

1410
01:48:29,893 --> 01:48:37,755
MATT: "Dealt with in the way that anyone who does
sloppy business: imprisoned. No longer of

1411
01:48:37,755 --> 01:48:40,477
"consequence. I was next in line."

1412
01:48:40,477 --> 01:48:47,607
MARISHA: I'm sorry, you think that the title of
Meat Man is so important that you had to kill or

1413
01:48:47,607 --> 01:48:51,038
attack a gnome who also went by Meat Man?

1414
01:48:51,038 --> 01:49:00,503
MATT: "The Meat Man I take the title from was not
killed by me. He was a great man. Small, but

1415
01:49:00,503 --> 01:49:13,415
"resolute. Confident. Handsome as they come. He
taught me everything I know. It is a shame that he

1416
01:49:13,415 --> 01:49:17,667
"has been lost in chains beneath the city, but I am
keeping up."

1417
01:49:17,667 --> 01:49:21,386
LAURA: <i>Such</i> a shame that's he's been lost.

1418
01:49:21,386 --> 01:49:24,928
MARISHA: So, you've taken on the title yourself.

1419
01:49:24,928 --> 01:49:27,164
MATT: "I have, in his memory."

1420
01:49:27,164 --> 01:49:30,055
MARISHA: And what city is he in chains beneath?

1421
01:49:30,055 --> 01:49:32,402
MATT: "Beneath Ank'harel in its deepest prisons."

1422
01:49:32,402 --> 01:49:34,628
ASHLEY: Did he tell you to take on his name?

1423
01:49:34,628 --> 01:49:41,810
MATT: "No, it was bequeathed by the others left
behind in his absence. They respect me, and as

1424
01:49:41,810 --> 01:49:45,520
"such, the Meat Man is I."

1425
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:47,923
LIAM: The name was simply meat-ed out.

1426
01:49:47,923 --> 01:49:50,264
MARISHA: He's totally Dread Pirates Roberts-ing
this shit.

1427
01:49:50,264 --> 01:49:53,830
TALIESIN: The designs of the guns are out of the
question.

1428
01:49:53,830 --> 01:49:56,796
That doesn't mean there aren't things on the table.

1429
01:49:56,796 --> 01:50:00,803
MATT: "If not the designs, perhaps a few rifles
and some ammunition.

1430
01:50:00,803 --> 01:50:04,737
"Something I can take back to my workers."

1431
01:50:04,737 --> 01:50:11,688
MARISHA: Here's a question: Why did Allura come to
you for information?

1432
01:50:11,688 --> 01:50:14,572
MATT: "Oh, she didn't come to me, but whispers
came to me

1433
01:50:14,572 --> 01:50:16,633
"that she was seeking this information."

1434
01:50:16,633 --> 01:50:21,717
MARISHA: Right. So you have ears in all the right
places.

1435
01:50:21,717 --> 01:50:23,374
MATT: "Everywhere, my dear."

1436
01:50:23,374 --> 01:50:29,982
SAM: You said workers? Are you a foreman of some
sort?

1437
01:50:29,982 --> 01:50:39,663
MATT: "You could say that. I run a business in
various goods. Some legal, and I make sure that

1438
01:50:39,663 --> 01:50:43,258
"clients get them in a very forthright manner."

1439
01:50:43,258 --> 01:50:49,158
TALIESIN: We're sadly very protective of our
copyrights, and my designs are not for

1440
01:50:49,158 --> 01:50:59,095
reproduction. Attempts at reproducing them tend to
end poorly. Many have tried; most have failed. If

1441
01:50:59,095 --> 01:51:07,879
you wanted, perhaps, a few designed, that could
have been a conversation, but so far, I'm not

1442
01:51:07,879 --> 01:51:09,526
impressed by you.

1443
01:51:09,526 --> 01:51:14,786
MATT: "Well then, we have nothing more to discuss,
then. Come, Chod."

1444
01:51:14,786 --> 01:51:16,804
JON: Okay, see you guys later!

1445
01:51:16,804 --> 01:51:25,360
LIAM: Before you leave-- prison. What was this
other Meat Man's offense? Do you know?

1446
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:26,461
JON: I don't know.

1447
01:51:26,461 --> 01:51:27,586
LIAM: You don't know anything.

1448
01:51:27,586 --> 01:51:29,507
JON: No, I don't know a lot of stuff. He doesn't
tell me.

1449
01:51:29,507 --> 01:51:30,776
LIAM: Do you like working for that guy?

1450
01:51:30,776 --> 01:51:33,249
JON: Yeah, he's great, he gives me money and food
and mutton.

1451
01:51:33,249 --> 01:51:35,402
MARISHA: What if we gave you money and food and
mutton?

1452
01:51:35,402 --> 01:51:36,794
LIAM: We have mutton.

1453
01:51:36,794 --> 01:51:38,250
MARISHA: How much money does he give you?

1454
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:44,242
JON: I like working for him. He keeps me safe.

1455
01:51:44,242 --> 01:51:46,052
SAM: What about this guy?

1456
01:51:46,052 --> 01:51:48,962
LIAM: What about this guy? For Wildmount! Your
brigade!

1457
01:51:48,962 --> 01:51:50,030
SAM: I mean...

1458
01:51:50,030 --> 01:51:51,574
LIAM: I mean, you got to start somewhere!

1459
01:51:51,574 --> 01:51:53,017
MARISHA: You could recruit him!

1460
01:51:53,017 --> 01:51:54,443
SAM: Wow. I mean--

1461
01:51:54,443 --> 01:51:56,835
LIAM: You were rough around the edges when we met
you!

1462
01:51:56,835 --> 01:51:59,047
JON: I feel like I should do earmuffs right now
again.

1463
01:51:59,047 --> 01:52:04,086
SAM: Yeah, I'm pretty sure I can do better than
this guy. I mean, he's really imposing and strong.

1464
01:52:04,086 --> 01:52:11,747
Also, guys, not to split hairs here, but his boss
is literally right there, listening to us. So

1465
01:52:11,747 --> 01:52:14,419
maybe we shouldn't be talking about recruiting his
employee.

1466
01:52:14,419 --> 01:52:17,161
MATT: "Your shiny friend has a point."

1467
01:52:17,161 --> 01:52:22,617
TALIESIN: I'm quite surprised by the brazenness.
What on earth made you think that we would sell

1468
01:52:22,617 --> 01:52:27,770
these designs to you? You obviously are paying
attention.

1469
01:52:27,770 --> 01:52:32,950
MATT: "As you hopefully know, the intent of
negotiation is to aim high."

1470
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:34,603
TALIESIN: That's fair.

1471
01:52:34,603 --> 01:52:41,663
MATT: "Then bring your expectations. So perhaps
not plans. But a few rifles, a pistol or two and

1472
01:52:41,663 --> 01:52:44,143
"some ammunition would be enough to outfit my
team."

1473
01:52:44,143 --> 01:52:46,106
LAURA: A whole team. With one pistol.

1474
01:52:46,106 --> 01:52:53,828
TALIESIN: One pistol can do a quite a bit. One
pistol can go far.

1475
01:52:53,828 --> 01:52:58,140
MARISHA: The problem is that once he has the
designs, he can replicate them.

1476
01:52:58,140 --> 01:52:59,502
LIAM: Reverse engineer.

1477
01:52:59,502 --> 01:53:02,473
LAURA: I don't think he would be able to reverse
engineer it.

1478
01:53:02,473 --> 01:53:05,743
MATT: "But I have my artisans at my disposal."

1479
01:53:05,743 --> 01:53:11,024
ASHLEY: Wait, why did you think we would want this
information?

1480
01:53:11,024 --> 01:53:19,423
MATT: "Well, if you don't, I'm happy to leave.
Make some business here, some gold and then be on

1481
01:53:19,423 --> 01:53:30,356
"my way. But I was informed that you, Vox Machina,
so widely respected, so strong, so rich, so

1482
01:53:30,356 --> 01:53:38,044
"involved in yourselves and your worldwide
endeavors, that perhaps a little more world-saving

1483
01:53:38,044 --> 01:53:42,555
"might be up your alley, but maybe I thought you
wrong."

1484
01:53:42,555 --> 01:53:45,851
TALIESIN: How's giving you one of my weapons
world-saving?

1485
01:53:45,851 --> 01:53:49,781
MATT: "Because the information I give you in
return may help save the world."

1486
01:53:49,781 --> 01:53:55,235
LIAM: You sound like you know about the stakes
involved.

1487
01:53:55,235 --> 01:53:57,436
MATT: "Just what I've been whispered."

1488
01:53:57,436 --> 01:54:03,052
MARISHA: We've met a lot of doom-seers. You sure
you can stand up to them?

1489
01:54:03,052 --> 01:54:11,478
MATT: "I grow tired of this conversation. If this
is a declination?"

1490
01:54:11,478 --> 01:54:15,060
TALIESIN: At the very least, this is a
conversation of whether or not you're ever going

1491
01:54:15,060 --> 01:54:19,032
to do business in this city again and what that
business is going to look like.

1492
01:54:19,032 --> 01:54:27,410
MATT: "Do not worry. You'll not see this face in
your precious Whitestone again." He stands up.

1493
01:54:27,410 --> 01:54:33,091
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check to see if I can
glean any more of what he knows about this

1494
01:54:33,091 --> 01:54:34,509
world-ending thing?

1495
01:54:34,509 --> 01:54:37,418
MATT: Okay. Insight check.

1496
01:54:37,418 --> 01:54:39,623
MARISHA: Natural 20.

1497
01:54:39,623 --> 01:54:41,994
SAM: Whisper!

1498
01:54:41,994 --> 01:54:43,588
TALIESIN: Earmuffs! Earmuffs!

1499
01:54:43,588 --> 01:54:45,590
LAURA: Everybody earmuffs!

1500
01:54:45,590 --> 01:54:52,350
LIAM: I mean, Tary, Grog is about as smart as a
golden retriever and he does great.

1501
01:54:52,350 --> 01:55:02,330
SAM: I know! But this guy seems like he would lose
a spelling bee to Grog. He's really dumb!

1502
01:55:02,330 --> 01:55:06,801
LAURA: Well, up until a few weeks ago, Grog
couldn't really spell, either.

1503
01:55:06,801 --> 01:55:08,292
ASHLEY: We could hold a spelling bee!

1504
01:55:08,292 --> 01:55:09,472
SAM: That's true.

1505
01:55:09,472 --> 01:55:12,010
MARISHA: Is he still walking away?

1506
01:55:12,010 --> 01:55:16,323
MATT: He's going over to the half-orc. He goes,
"Come on, we're leaving."

1507
01:55:16,323 --> 01:55:22,424
MARISHA: I look at Vex and Vax and them and I say,
we know him.

1508
01:55:22,424 --> 01:55:23,943
LAURA: Give it a moment.

1509
01:55:23,943 --> 01:55:25,481
MARISHA: There's something familiar about him.

1510
01:55:25,481 --> 01:55:27,054
LAURA: I go and I follow him.

1511
01:55:27,054 --> 01:55:28,205
MATT: Okay, he walks out.

1512
01:55:28,205 --> 01:55:29,816
MARISHA: He knows more than he's letting on.

1513
01:55:29,816 --> 01:55:30,971
MATT: "Come!"

1514
01:55:30,971 --> 01:55:38,523
JON: All right, I'm coming. You guys should really
reconsider, that's a word he just told me. I mean,

1515
01:55:38,523 --> 01:55:47,584
he sounds scary and all, but it's really awesome
stuff he has to share if you guys just shared

1516
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:51,029
back. Okay. See you.

1517
01:55:51,077 --> 01:55:53,464
LAURA: I follow him right out of the room.

1518
01:55:53,464 --> 01:55:57,513
MATT: Both of them walk out into the daylight and
you follow.

1519
01:55:57,569 --> 01:55:58,759
LAURA: Aes.

1520
01:55:58,759 --> 01:56:03,932
MATT: He turns around. "Yes?"

1521
01:56:03,932 --> 01:56:06,132
LAURA: I run up and I hug him.

1522
01:56:06,132 --> 01:56:09,140
MATT: Okay! Full-body?

1523
01:56:09,140 --> 01:56:13,834
LAURA: Just a big hug! And I go down.

1524
01:56:13,834 --> 01:56:19,275
MATT: Okay. Immediately, instinctively, he backs
up and you watch as Vex's arms pass through the

1525
01:56:19,275 --> 01:56:23,593
legs and thighs and grab onto something smaller on
the inside.

1526
01:56:23,593 --> 01:56:24,671
MARISHA: Motherfucker!

1527
01:56:24,671 --> 01:56:29,798
SAM: (as Scanlan) Stop! Stop stop stop stop stop!
Not here! Not here! Let's go somewhere else. Now.

1528
01:56:29,798 --> 01:56:31,141
Let's go.

1529
01:56:31,141 --> 01:56:34,371
TALIESIN: What?! What?! No!

1530
01:56:34,371 --> 01:56:38,511
MARISHA: Motherfucker! Motherfucker!

1531
01:56:38,511 --> 01:56:40,282
MATT: And let's go ahead and take a break!

1532
01:56:40,282 --> 01:56:42,353
(screaming)

1533
01:56:42,353 --> 01:56:45,329
TRAVIS: I'll kill you! I'm going to kill you!

1534
01:56:45,329 --> 01:56:47,824
MARISHA: Motherfucker!

1535
01:56:47,824 --> 01:56:51,478
TRAVIS: How could you?

1536
01:56:51,478 --> 01:56:53,712
MARISHA: Natural 20!

1537
01:56:53,712 --> 01:56:55,450
TALIESIN: Oh, well done, you.

1538
01:56:55,450 --> 01:56:58,623
MATT: We're going to take a quick break, be right
back here in a minute to pick this up. We're going

1539
01:56:58,623 --> 01:57:04,800
to go ahead and have a Twitch giveaway in the
chatroom for this awesome Wyrmwood complete

1540
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:11,917
system. This includes a dice tray, a dice box, a
couple of fun things. It's zebrawood, which is

1541
01:57:11,917 --> 01:57:18,908
nice. But, to win this, you have to go into the
Twitch chat. The code for this is 'bardbarian."

1542
01:57:18,908 --> 01:57:25,857
B-A-R-D-B-A-R-I-A-N. Barbarian, but with
bard-barian. Cool. So, we'll see you guys back

1543
01:57:25,857 --> 01:57:27,398
here in a few minutes.

1544
01:57:27,398 --> 01:57:29,672
TRAVIS: You! Son of a <i>bitch!</i>

1545
01:57:29,672 --> 01:57:30,861
LAURA: Oh my god!

1546
01:57:30,861 --> 02:11:39,419
[break]

1547
02:11:39,419 --> 02:11:42,339
MATT: Hello, guys! And welcome back to tonight's
episode of Critical Role!

1548
02:11:42,339 --> 02:11:44,148
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch!

1549
02:11:44,148 --> 02:11:55,769
MATT: (laughs) So picking up where we left off,
Lionel, you just watched as this half-elf girl

1550
02:11:55,769 --> 02:12:04,017
forcefully merged with part of your boss, and your
boss starts freaking out as everyone else, you all

1551
02:12:04,017 --> 02:12:08,535
spook in mid-daylight as you hear this familiar
voice come through, saying...

1552
02:12:08,535 --> 02:12:10,661
What did you say, again?

1553
02:12:10,661 --> 02:12:13,162
SAM: They were all there? I thought she just
followed me.

1554
02:12:13,162 --> 02:12:14,311
TALIESIN: We were not there.

1555
02:12:14,311 --> 02:12:16,672
MATT: Oh, it was just you. You guys were still
inside the tavern.

1556
02:12:16,672 --> 02:12:17,969
SAM: Is Lionel there, though?

1557
02:12:17,969 --> 02:12:19,188
MATT: He left with you.

1558
02:12:19,188 --> 02:12:22,406
JON: (gasps)

1559
02:12:22,406 --> 02:12:27,622
SAM: Lionel. Please. Go back inside.

1560
02:12:27,622 --> 02:12:29,416
JON: What did you do? What did you do?

1561
02:12:29,416 --> 02:12:30,924
SAM: Go back inside the tavern.

1562
02:12:30,924 --> 02:12:32,385
JON: Where's Aes? Where's Aes?

1563
02:12:32,385 --> 02:12:35,883
SAM: I am still he. Please, go back inside the
tavern.

1564
02:12:35,883 --> 02:12:38,144
JON: Okay.

1565
02:12:38,144 --> 02:12:39,893
SAM: Wait for me there.

1566
02:12:39,893 --> 02:12:42,545
JON: They were nice people anyway. All right.

1567
02:12:42,545 --> 02:12:53,228
MATT: So, Vex, you're now there, staring at the
Danny Trejo-like visage of the Meat Man.

1568
02:12:53,228 --> 02:13:01,095
SAM: I'll grab her by the hand and pull her
into... Is there a back alley or a side place or a

1569
02:13:01,095 --> 02:13:02,488
shadow anywhere?

1570
02:13:02,488 --> 02:13:07,180
MATT: There's, maybe about 15 feet off, a little
alley you could duck into, yeah.

1571
02:13:07,180 --> 02:13:09,392
SAM: Come with me.

1572
02:13:09,392 --> 02:13:10,965
LAURA: Of course.

1573
02:13:10,965 --> 02:13:17,970
SAM: When we're safely off the street, I take off
the Hat of Disguise and reveal myself.

1574
02:13:17,970 --> 02:13:20,918
LAURA: Scanlan!

1575
02:13:20,918 --> 02:13:22,186
SAM: Hi.

1576
02:13:22,186 --> 02:13:26,645
LAURA: What are you doing? I mean, I knew it was
you, but I thought you were going to reveal

1577
02:13:26,645 --> 02:13:28,333
yourself to everyone.

1578
02:13:28,333 --> 02:13:34,382
MATT: What you do notice about Scanlan...
Definitely tanner skin; that scar you saw under

1579
02:13:34,382 --> 02:13:40,453
the eye, still there on Scanlan, and the clothing
and the outfit design is much more Marquesian than

1580
02:13:40,453 --> 02:13:44,516
you recall. Definitely more Gilmore than Scanlan.

1581
02:13:44,516 --> 02:13:46,399
LAURA: Have you been there the whole time?

1582
02:13:46,399 --> 02:13:53,644
SAM: Not the whole time, but for much of it. I
didn't know if I could talk to you all.

1583
02:13:53,644 --> 02:13:56,879
LAURA: I hold his hand and just listen.

1584
02:13:56,879 --> 02:14:04,235
SAM: There's a lot to talk about, but not here. I
have appearances to keep up, I have people

1585
02:14:04,235 --> 02:14:06,229
depending on me who work for me.

1586
02:14:06,229 --> 02:14:08,577
LAURA: Are you really the Meat Man there?

1587
02:14:08,577 --> 02:14:11,675
SAM: I am many things.

1588
02:14:11,675 --> 02:14:12,761
LAURA: Darling.

1589
02:14:12,761 --> 02:14:13,911
SAM: Well, I am.

1590
02:14:13,911 --> 02:14:15,643
LAURA: Okay.

1591
02:14:15,643 --> 02:14:27,375
SAM: Yes, I am, but it's not what you would think.
I'm not a bad guy. This is not the place to talk

1592
02:14:27,375 --> 02:14:32,769
about this. Listen to me. Vex, there will be a
time to discuss this, but right now,

1593
02:14:32,769 --> 02:14:34,932
I'm casting Modify Memory on you.

1594
02:14:34,932 --> 02:14:35,855
LAURA: Don't you do it.

1595
02:14:35,855 --> 02:14:36,768
SAM: Yes.

1596
02:14:36,768 --> 02:14:39,420
LAURA: Don't you do it! I push him against the
wall. Can I break it?

1597
02:14:39,420 --> 02:14:41,039
Can I break it before he does it?

1598
02:14:41,039 --> 02:14:46,375
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw. Actually, no,
for this I'm going to have to ask you guys both to

1599
02:14:46,375 --> 02:14:49,114
roll initiative. That's what this is going to come
down to.

1600
02:14:49,114 --> 02:14:50,918
MARISHA: Come on, Vex!

1601
02:14:50,918 --> 02:14:52,647
SAM: That's not good.

1602
02:14:52,647 --> 02:14:53,763
TALIESIN: Yes!

1603
02:14:53,763 --> 02:14:55,653
LIAM: We got an actual dice roll in the game!

1604
02:14:55,653 --> 02:14:56,737
LAURA: 24.

1605
02:14:56,737 --> 02:14:57,974
SAM: Six.

1606
02:14:57,974 --> 02:15:07,038
MATT: Okay. So he begins, after saying this,
casting the spell. What do you do?

1607
02:15:07,038 --> 02:15:09,394
LAURA: No! I grab his hands and cover his mouth!

1608
02:15:09,394 --> 02:15:13,530
MATT: Okay. I'll say go ahead and make a
concentration check, so make a constitution saving

1609
02:15:13,530 --> 02:15:24,706
throw. I'm going to have you... Let's see, for
this... Just roll a d20.

1610
02:15:24,706 --> 02:15:28,032
SAM: Constitution saving throw?

1611
02:15:28,032 --> 02:15:29,034
MATT: Yes.

1612
02:15:29,034 --> 02:15:31,618
LAURA: Do I add to it?

1613
02:15:31,618 --> 02:15:33,215
MATT: Roll a d20 and add your dex modifier to it.

1614
02:15:33,215 --> 02:15:34,603
LAURA: Dex modifier or dex saving throw?

1615
02:15:34,603 --> 02:15:37,206
MATT: Dex modifier.

1616
02:15:37,206 --> 02:15:39,299
TALIESIN: No! No!

1617
02:15:39,299 --> 02:15:41,298
MARISHA: No!

1618
02:15:41,298 --> 02:15:45,053
TRAVIS: Oh, two ones! Two ones!

1619
02:15:45,053 --> 02:15:48,472
LIAM: Everybody speechless.

1620
02:15:48,472 --> 02:16:00,612
MATT: So as you go to push him into the wall, you
accidentally hit between where his foot and the

1621
02:16:00,612 --> 02:16:04,526
edge of the stone is and it causes you to stumble
forward and slam into him. You fall over. You, in

1622
02:16:04,526 --> 02:16:07,044
the process, she hits you in the side of the...

1623
02:16:07,044 --> 02:16:09,549
SAM: Do we accidentally kiss? Is that what's going
to happen here?

1624
02:16:09,549 --> 02:16:13,310
MATT: Almost, but instead, you both accidentally
end up elbowing the shit out of each other. She

1625
02:16:13,310 --> 02:16:19,281
falls over, you tumble over her and become this
tangled pile of soreness. The spell is lost.

1626
02:16:19,281 --> 02:16:20,450
SAM: Damn it!

1627
02:16:20,450 --> 02:16:28,080
MATT: However, you guys in the tavern, hear a
(flurry of blows) against the wall on the outside.

1628
02:16:28,080 --> 02:16:30,502
LIAM: I was starting to follow. I push the door
open...

1629
02:16:30,502 --> 02:16:32,351
SAM: You can't tell them! You can't tell them!

1630
02:16:32,351 --> 02:16:34,519
LIAM: Holy shit!

1631
02:16:34,519 --> 02:16:36,427
TALIESIN: I hear that and I start walking out.

1632
02:16:36,427 --> 02:16:37,628
LIAM: Holy shit!

1633
02:16:37,628 --> 02:16:39,695
LAURA: Shut up, shut up, shut up! Shush!

1634
02:16:39,695 --> 02:16:42,794
MARISHA: I bust through right behind Vax.

1635
02:16:42,794 --> 02:16:44,229
MATT: You guys all rush around to the alley.

1636
02:16:44,279 --> 02:16:45,310
MARISHA: You dick!

1637
02:16:45,369 --> 02:16:46,992
TALIESIN: Now I run.

1638
02:16:47,068 --> 02:16:50,192
MARISHA: I knew you were familiar!

1639
02:16:50,192 --> 02:16:55,310
LAURA: Everyone, shut up! Shut up, shut up. If you
need to do something, change back, do it.

1640
02:16:55,310 --> 02:16:57,748
SAM: How long does the hat take?

1641
02:16:57,748 --> 02:16:59,789
MATT: It takes an action to do the spell.

1642
02:16:59,789 --> 02:17:02,403
SAM: Okay. Hat on. (whoosh)

1643
02:17:02,403 --> 02:17:04,238
LAURA: Appearances are important.

1644
02:17:04,238 --> 02:17:06,562
ASHLEY: I make my way through. What's going on?

1645
02:17:06,562 --> 02:17:12,835
MARISHA: No one talks about Scanlan being handsome
as much as Scanlan does. That was your first

1646
02:17:12,835 --> 02:17:14,278
giveaway, mister!

1647
02:17:14,278 --> 02:17:16,429
LIAM: We're in an alley, though, off to the
side, right?

1648
02:17:16,429 --> 02:17:18,011
MATT: Yeah, you're in a dark alley.

1649
02:17:18,011 --> 02:17:20,062
LIAM: Well, then I'm giving him a big fucking
hug!

1650
02:17:20,062 --> 02:17:22,334
SAM: It's hard to do, but yes.

1651
02:17:22,334 --> 02:17:28,053
MATT: So, Lionel, everyone just charges out of the
tavern, and you hear a big commotion

1652
02:17:28,053 --> 02:17:29,893
and voices on the side.

1653
02:17:29,893 --> 02:17:37,475
JON: What's going on, you guys? What's happening?
Can I... I think they're attacking him.

1654
02:17:37,475 --> 02:17:41,072
MATT: At this point, you watch as the other one is
now grabbing him, merging.

1655
02:17:41,072 --> 02:17:45,428
JON: Yeah, it looks like they're attacking. So I
want to protect him.

1656
02:17:45,428 --> 02:17:47,102
SAM: As he should.

1657
02:17:47,102 --> 02:17:50,033
MATT: What are you going to do to protect him?

1658
02:17:50,033 --> 02:17:51,566
TALIESIN: You can go ahead and just say.

1659
02:17:51,566 --> 02:17:54,431
MATT: Are you going to scare them off, are you
going to attack them?

1660
02:17:54,431 --> 02:17:55,832
SAM: Kill them?

1661
02:17:55,832 --> 02:18:02,273
JON: Yeah. No! I want to scare them away, and...

1662
02:18:02,273 --> 02:18:05,265
MATT: Do you have an ability that does that?

1663
02:18:05,265 --> 02:18:09,661
TALIESIN: Or you can try and intimidate us, and
say something really scary, or make some noise.

1664
02:18:09,661 --> 02:18:13,325
JON: No, I want to do the Frantic Flail.

1665
02:18:13,325 --> 02:18:19,282
MATT: Okay, all right. So as you're hugging him,
you guys watch as the half-orc turns the corner,

1666
02:18:19,282 --> 02:18:26,674
spooks, and then, suddenly, you watch as something
beneath the armor glows briefly, and he starts

1667
02:18:26,674 --> 02:18:33,505
flapping his arms, going (honking) right at you. I
need you to make a wisdom saving throw.

1668
02:18:33,505 --> 02:18:35,152
TRAVIS: What?

1669
02:18:35,152 --> 02:18:37,240
JON: It'll be explained later.

1670
02:18:37,240 --> 02:18:41,197
LIAM: It's not... Does it have anything to do with
charm, or sleep, by any chance?

1671
02:18:41,197 --> 02:18:42,385
MATT: Nope.

1672
02:18:42,385 --> 02:18:46,437
LIAM: No. Okay. All right. Oh, that's fine. 20.

1673
02:18:46,437 --> 02:18:47,702
JON: Damn.

1674
02:18:47,702 --> 02:18:52,997
MATT: Okay, so it doesn't spook you off, it's just
a little weird, as this giant man is now honking

1675
02:18:52,997 --> 02:18:57,204
and waving and flapping his arms at you. He
doesn't seem to be affected by it, he just gives

1676
02:18:57,204 --> 02:18:58,570
you a strange look.

1677
02:18:58,570 --> 02:18:59,815
JON: Yeah.

1678
02:18:59,815 --> 02:19:04,021
SAM: It's okay, stand down, Lionel. I can defend
myself.

1679
02:19:04,021 --> 02:19:08,161
JON: Because you know I'm good for... That
normally works on everybody else.

1680
02:19:08,161 --> 02:19:14,144
SAM: You are my best man, and I appreciate your
concern, but these people pose no threat to us.

1681
02:19:14,144 --> 02:19:15,922
LIAM: That is a really good accent.

1682
02:19:15,922 --> 02:19:17,228
MARISHA: Yeah, you're so good at that.

1683
02:19:17,228 --> 02:19:19,028
JON: What are they talking about, accent?

1684
02:19:19,028 --> 02:19:25,957
SAM: They are beguiled by our foreign ways and
they are scared of what they do not understand.

1685
02:19:25,957 --> 02:19:27,457
LIAM: True.

1686
02:19:27,457 --> 02:19:33,948
TALIESIN: That's true. I'm going to start walking
back to the inn, and I'm going to start pouring a

1687
02:19:33,948 --> 02:19:36,677
lot of drinks and putting them on the table.

1688
02:19:36,677 --> 02:19:39,537
SAM: I do have information to share with you.

1689
02:19:39,537 --> 02:19:43,826
LIAM: We want to hear all of that information.

1690
02:19:43,826 --> 02:19:48,504
JON: You still gotta give us the designs. No?

1691
02:19:48,504 --> 02:19:49,761
LAURA: No.

1692
02:19:49,761 --> 02:19:51,074
SAM: I mean.

1693
02:19:51,074 --> 02:19:55,143
MARISHA: Why did you want the designs?

1694
02:19:55,143 --> 02:20:01,272
SAM: Percival's guns are really cool, and I've
always wanted to have some of my own, and I used

1695
02:20:01,272 --> 02:20:08,304
all of my ammunition over the year, and now I just
have this pistol. And I produce the pistol. But it

1696
02:20:08,304 --> 02:20:11,670
has no bullets! I don't know how to make any more
bullets! I need more bullets!

1697
02:20:11,670 --> 02:20:16,142
MARISHA: Are you a mafia don, Scanlan? Are you a
bad guy?

1698
02:20:16,142 --> 02:20:18,739
SAM: I'll take off the hat.

1699
02:20:18,739 --> 02:20:23,966
MATT: Okay. Lionel, you watch as your boss for the
past five months shifts

1700
02:20:23,966 --> 02:20:25,736
into this tiny little man.

1701
02:20:25,736 --> 02:20:27,531
SAM: Lionel, we'll talk about this later.

1702
02:20:27,531 --> 02:20:28,725
JON: (screams)

1703
02:20:28,725 --> 02:20:31,498
SAM: I have many forms and I am-- Did you just
piss your pants?

1704
02:20:31,498 --> 02:20:35,502
JON: I'll go stand in the corner now.

1705
02:20:35,502 --> 02:20:45,981
SAM: I have many forms and I master magic that you
will never understand, but know this: The money I

1706
02:20:45,981 --> 02:20:49,258
pay you is real, so you still work for me.

1707
02:20:49,258 --> 02:20:52,869
JON: That's true. Okay, I'm good.

1708
02:20:52,869 --> 02:20:58,366
SAM: All right. Just hang tight. I mean, you can
stay, stay here. Mop yourself up or something.

1709
02:20:58,366 --> 02:21:02,722
You're a good man. I'm sorry I do these things to
you.

1710
02:21:02,722 --> 02:21:04,190
JON: You're so tiny, though.

1711
02:21:04,190 --> 02:21:05,923
SAM: I'm strong of heart.

1712
02:21:05,923 --> 02:21:08,748
JON: You haven't been that strong, but anyway.

1713
02:21:08,748 --> 02:21:16,068
MARISHA: I pull Chod, Chard, Chode...

1714
02:21:16,068 --> 02:21:17,767
JON: Lionel.

1715
02:21:17,767 --> 02:21:27,153
MARISHA: Lionel. I pull Lionel aside. And I grab
him by the face, and I say, we need you to be

1716
02:21:27,153 --> 02:21:34,229
coherent and honest during this. And I cast
Enhance Ability and give him Owl's Wisdom.

1717
02:21:34,229 --> 02:21:35,908
MATT: Okay.

1718
02:21:35,908 --> 02:21:38,627
JON: I'll take that. I'm not going to fight back.

1719
02:21:38,627 --> 02:21:42,225
MARISHA: It increases your wisdom. You get
advantage on wisdom.

1720
02:21:42,225 --> 02:21:44,783
SAM: Yeah, but now I can't erase his fucking
memory.

1721
02:21:44,783 --> 02:21:50,462
LAURA: You've just been going crazy with that
Modify Memory, haven't you?

1722
02:21:50,462 --> 02:21:53,833
SAM: Hey, man, it's my bag of tricks, all right?

1723
02:21:53,833 --> 02:21:57,898
LIAM: So are we going to do this in an alleyway,
or are we going to go get a drink, and you tell us

1724
02:21:57,898 --> 02:21:59,670
where the fuck you've been?

1725
02:21:59,670 --> 02:22:01,858
LAURA: Should we go inside? It's an empty fucking
bar.

1726
02:22:01,858 --> 02:22:06,938
SAM: Okay. Let's go back inside the tavern, but
just know this. He doesn't drink, all right?

1727
02:22:06,938 --> 02:22:08,944
LAURA: Sure.

1728
02:22:08,944 --> 02:22:13,156
LIAM: Whatever. Come on. We want to hear what
you've been doing for a year. Come on!

1729
02:22:13,156 --> 02:22:14,231
SAM: All right.

1730
02:22:14,231 --> 02:22:15,824
JON: Thank you for remembering.

1731
02:22:15,824 --> 02:22:17,203
SAM: You're my guy.

1732
02:22:17,203 --> 02:22:20,202
MATT: You guys make your way back into the
tavern.

1733
02:22:20,202 --> 02:22:21,730
TALIESIN: It is set up.

1734
02:22:21,730 --> 02:22:24,712
MATT: You now have the delightful experience of
roleplaying two characters,

1735
02:22:24,712 --> 02:22:28,173
Sam, in the same scene.

1736
02:22:28,173 --> 02:22:29,753
LIAM: Boy, that's got to suck.

1737
02:22:29,753 --> 02:22:31,762
MATT: Welcome to my world.

1738
02:22:31,762 --> 02:22:33,418
JON: I can kill Taryon.

1739
02:22:33,418 --> 02:22:44,140
SAM: I have to go check on Doty! Look at the time!
Good-bye!

1740
02:22:44,140 --> 02:22:47,927
LAURA: Look, this is that guy we were telling you
about for so long.

1741
02:22:47,927 --> 02:22:50,329
SAM: The skeevy asshole that you always talk
about?

1742
02:22:50,329 --> 02:22:53,033
TALIESIN: Yes, the skeevy asshole, that would be
the one.

1743
02:22:53,033 --> 02:22:55,380
SAM: He's pretty handsome.

1744
02:22:55,380 --> 02:22:58,742
TALIESIN: You would say that, wouldn't you?

1745
02:22:58,742 --> 02:23:02,649
ASHLEY: I think I'll go with you, Tary.

1746
02:23:02,649 --> 02:23:04,734
LAURA: Pike...

1747
02:23:04,734 --> 02:23:06,227
ASHLEY: It's fine.

1748
02:23:06,227 --> 02:23:07,651
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'll go, too.

1749
02:23:07,651 --> 02:23:10,716
SAM: What? All right.

1750
02:23:10,716 --> 02:23:13,096
TALIESIN: I want to listen.

1751
02:23:13,096 --> 02:23:17,134
LIAM: I'm curious. Talk to us, man.

1752
02:23:17,134 --> 02:23:19,001
SAM: All right.

1753
02:23:19,001 --> 02:23:21,482
LAURA: Talk to them. Don't let them leave.

1754
02:23:21,482 --> 02:23:24,879
SAM: You all can stay. It's been a while.

1755
02:23:24,879 --> 02:23:26,506
TRAVIS: It has.

1756
02:23:26,506 --> 02:23:32,114
SAM: Yes. Yes, just stay. It's fine.

1757
02:23:32,114 --> 02:23:34,251
MARISHA: Is it, though, Scanlan?

1758
02:23:34,251 --> 02:23:38,181
TALIESIN: What would you have done if I had just
decided to open fire on you?

1759
02:23:38,181 --> 02:23:41,848
LAURA: I would've stopped you, darling. I knew it
was him right away.

1760
02:23:41,848 --> 02:23:49,790
SAM: I would've done what Scanlan would always do.
I would've won and killed you. I mean, I'm super

1761
02:23:49,790 --> 02:23:51,571
powerful and awesome.

1762
02:23:51,571 --> 02:23:56,375
TALIESIN: Yes. But really. This was not a good
plan.

1763
02:23:56,375 --> 02:24:02,280
MARISHA: Scanlan, there are some hurt feelings in
this room, and it might be time to address those.

1764
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:15,399
SAM: I know. I know. But for now, let's just catch
up. What have you guys

1765
02:24:15,399 --> 02:24:18,158
been up to for the last year?

1766
02:24:18,158 --> 02:24:22,182
LIAM: No, no, no. After you, dear. After you.

1767
02:24:22,182 --> 02:24:25,287
MARISHA: I'm chief of my people!

1768
02:24:25,287 --> 02:24:27,498
SAM: Oh, you did your Aramente!

1769
02:24:27,498 --> 02:24:32,848
MARISHA: I did! I wish you were there! I mentioned
you and everything in my speech.

1770
02:24:32,848 --> 02:24:33,913
SAM: You did?

1771
02:24:33,913 --> 02:24:35,200
MARISHA: Yeah!

1772
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:36,384
SAM: That sounds nice.

1773
02:24:36,384 --> 02:24:37,505
MARISHA: Yeah!

1774
02:24:37,505 --> 02:24:43,604
SAM: Anybody else ascend to new heights? No?

1775
02:24:43,604 --> 02:24:44,784
TALIESIN: Yes.

1776
02:24:44,784 --> 02:24:46,509
SAM: Yes?

1777
02:24:46,509 --> 02:24:53,408
TALIESIN: Yes. None of your business at the
moment. Tell us your business.

1778
02:24:53,408 --> 02:24:55,409
LIAM: Where have you been?

1779
02:24:55,409 --> 02:25:02,131
SAM: I went traveling a bit. I did what gnomes do,
I went into the forest with Kaylie.

1780
02:25:02,131 --> 02:25:11,660
ASHLEY: Oh, is that what gnomes do? They go into
the forest? I'm so sorry, please continue.

1781
02:25:11,660 --> 02:25:24,512
SAM: Forest gnomes do. And we talked, and we sang
songs, and we camped, not in the mansion, just in

1782
02:25:24,512 --> 02:25:33,630
a tent. We had some good times and bad times
together, and eventually we found our way to

1783
02:25:33,630 --> 02:25:39,275
Ank'harel, and some stuff happened, yadda yadda,
and I'm here now, you know?

1784
02:25:39,275 --> 02:25:45,784
LAURA: I try to pass my hand through Lionel's
stomach to see if he's actually Kaylie.

1785
02:25:45,784 --> 02:25:47,311
SAM: Is he?

1786
02:25:47,311 --> 02:25:56,414
JON: You feel tons of abs. It bounces off and hits
you in the face with your own hand.

1787
02:25:56,414 --> 02:25:59,173
TALIESIN: I was with you on that one.

1788
02:25:59,173 --> 02:26:01,637
LAURA: Serious, serious abs.

1789
02:26:01,637 --> 02:26:04,079
LIAM: Where's Kaylie now?

1790
02:26:04,079 --> 02:26:08,562
SAM: She's with me, yeah? No, did we leave her
back there?

1791
02:26:08,562 --> 02:26:12,917
MATT: Kaylie's in Ank'harel. Essentially, you...

1792
02:26:12,917 --> 02:26:23,988
SAM: She is... It's complicated, but right now,
she is the Meat Man. She is back in Ank'harel,

1793
02:26:23,988 --> 02:26:27,969
taking on the business while I'm off here.

1794
02:26:27,969 --> 02:26:31,096
LIAM: How are you two doing?

1795
02:26:31,096 --> 02:26:35,936
SAM: Pretty good. We're a good team. Yeah.

1796
02:26:35,936 --> 02:26:37,940
MARISHA: Does she like you now?

1797
02:26:37,940 --> 02:26:40,932
SAM: 'Like' is a strong word.

1798
02:26:40,932 --> 02:26:42,907
TALIESIN: It's really not.

1799
02:26:42,907 --> 02:26:47,366
JON: 'Love' is a stronger word. That's why people
use 'like'.

1800
02:26:47,366 --> 02:26:51,334
LIAM: There's that Owl's Wisdom right there.

1801
02:26:51,334 --> 02:26:53,805
JON: Whoa. What just happened?

1802
02:26:53,805 --> 02:26:56,161
TALIESIN: You have advantage on wisdom saving
throws.

1803
02:26:56,161 --> 02:26:59,178
JON: It's weird. It's new to me.

1804
02:26:59,178 --> 02:27:09,094
SAM: We're fine, she and I. We're a team, and
she's taught me some stuff, and I've taught her

1805
02:27:09,094 --> 02:27:12,925
some stuff, and we operate together.

1806
02:27:12,925 --> 02:27:19,646
MARISHA: And what kind of operation do you
operate?

1807
02:27:19,646 --> 02:27:32,202
SAM: We went to Ank'harel to get a little simple
revenge, and it turned into something more than

1808
02:27:32,202 --> 02:27:41,142
that, and I didn't mean to, but I guess I became
one of the

1809
02:27:41,142 --> 02:27:44,068
three largest crime bosses in Ank'harel.

1810
02:27:44,068 --> 02:27:46,162
LIAM: In a year.

1811
02:27:46,162 --> 02:27:52,418
SAM: Eight months, really. We traveled around
close to here. We were only 20 miles away for most

1812
02:27:52,418 --> 02:28:06,602
of the first couple months, and then it took us
time to get there. Don't worry, though, I'm not a

1813
02:28:06,602 --> 02:28:17,522
bad guy. I just sell things, trinkets, furniture,
art pieces, antiquities, that sort of thing.

1814
02:28:17,522 --> 02:28:19,068
LIAM: Nothing dangerous?

1815
02:28:19,068 --> 02:28:21,226
SAM: Nothing dangerous. All fake.

1816
02:28:21,226 --> 02:28:24,190
MARISHA: And to whom do you sell these things?

1817
02:28:24,190 --> 02:28:32,153
SAM: Rat bastards. People who deserve it. People
with money to burn, and people who have done wrong

1818
02:28:32,153 --> 02:28:35,608
in their lives. I take some back.

1819
02:28:35,608 --> 02:28:47,825
LIAM: Why now? Why have you come back? Not that
I'm not overjoyed to see you, but I'm curious.

1820
02:28:47,825 --> 02:28:58,073
SAM: I had information, and you had to know it.
It's important. We found another one. Lionel did.

1821
02:28:58,073 --> 02:28:59,604
The ziggurat.

1822
02:28:59,604 --> 02:29:01,259
LAURA: Did you go inside?

1823
02:29:01,259 --> 02:29:04,575
JON: Another? You didn't tell me there was more!

1824
02:29:04,575 --> 02:29:08,479
SAM: No, no, I mean, there's the one you found,
and then there's one here.

1825
02:29:08,479 --> 02:29:09,893
JON: (gasps)

1826
02:29:09,893 --> 02:29:13,090
SAM: Yes. Will you tell them what you saw?

1827
02:29:13,090 --> 02:29:18,553
JON: Well, me and my buddies, we went inside
this...

1828
02:29:18,553 --> 02:29:23,664
SAM: Can I clarify, these are all hired men of
mine. They're not his buddies. I pay them all.

1829
02:29:23,664 --> 02:29:25,359
LIAM: Could be both.

1830
02:29:25,359 --> 02:29:27,667
SAM: I mean, maybe they're friends now, but,
okay.

1831
02:29:27,667 --> 02:29:29,602
JON: Well, no, they're dead now.

1832
02:29:29,602 --> 02:29:32,436
SAM: That's fair.

1833
02:29:32,436 --> 02:29:41,863
JON: I guess, if they weren't buddies, then I
shouldn't feel bad anymore. The bad feelings will

1834
02:29:41,863 --> 02:29:56,714
go away. We went inside the mountain, following
some people that... Do I call you Aes, or?

1835
02:29:56,714 --> 02:29:58,724
SAM: That's fine.

1836
02:29:58,724 --> 02:30:01,756
JON: Okay. Aes here told us to follow some
people.

1837
02:30:01,756 --> 02:30:09,415
SAM: I had learned of someone new coming into town
and stealing some magical artifacts and leaving

1838
02:30:09,415 --> 02:30:17,035
some dead bodies, and it wasn't my organization,
and it wasn't any of the other two leading crime

1839
02:30:17,035 --> 02:30:24,067
organizations, I found out through my whispers. So
it was someone new, and I wanted to find out who

1840
02:30:24,067 --> 02:30:31,055
it was, so I sent Lionel, my best man, and his
buddies to investigate.

1841
02:30:31,055 --> 02:30:33,963
TALIESIN: There was a comma there.

1842
02:30:33,963 --> 02:30:41,664
JON: So, yeah, and he knew he could trust us
because we're awesome. We were going to go get

1843
02:30:41,664 --> 02:30:47,896
some information. So we followed them into this
big tunnel that goes into the mountain. We had to

1844
02:30:47,896 --> 02:30:55,219
go through, it took a long time and we had to
fight a lot of cool stuff along the way, but

1845
02:30:55,219 --> 02:30:57,160
nothing important to this.

1846
02:30:57,160 --> 02:31:03,165
SAM: I mean, all the details are good, just, when
you tell a story, lots of details.

1847
02:31:03,165 --> 02:31:04,699
JON: Lots of details?

1848
02:31:04,699 --> 02:31:06,708
SAM: Yeah, yeah, paints a picture.

1849
02:31:06,708 --> 02:31:08,746
JON: Well, I've never been good at stories.

1850
02:31:08,746 --> 02:31:10,560
MARISHA: You're doing great.

1851
02:31:10,560 --> 02:31:20,154
JON: But when we got to the middle, we found a big
giant pyramid. Or a ziggy-star-- what?

1852
02:31:20,154 --> 02:31:21,457
SAM: Ziggy stardust.

1853
02:31:21,457 --> 02:31:23,816
JON: Is that what you call it?

1854
02:31:23,816 --> 02:31:25,115
SAM: Ziggurat.

1855
02:31:25,115 --> 02:31:28,042
LIAM: Pyramid's good. We're with you, yeah.

1856
02:31:28,042 --> 02:31:33,567
JON: We found a pyramid, and we saw all these guys
hanging around it, and right at the top of the

1857
02:31:33,567 --> 02:31:41,570
pyramid was this big black ball. It looked like a
pearl, but it was giant. It was at the top of the

1858
02:31:41,570 --> 02:31:51,938
pyramid, and these guys, wearing these really cool
but scary hoods and robes, they were throwing

1859
02:31:51,938 --> 02:31:59,196
stuff on the black orb, and it was breaking and
absorbing the stuff. And then this one guy--

1860
02:31:59,196 --> 02:32:01,359
MARISHA: What were they throwing in?

1861
02:32:01,359 --> 02:32:05,920
JON: Oh, it was anything. Some of them threw
treasure, some of them

1862
02:32:05,920 --> 02:32:10,906
threw some real animals. Alive.

1863
02:32:10,906 --> 02:32:12,678
SAM: And a person.

1864
02:32:12,678 --> 02:32:14,198
JON: I was getting to that!

1865
02:32:14,198 --> 02:32:16,677
SAM: Sorry, sorry, I don't want to cut you off.
Keep going. Keep going.

1866
02:32:16,677 --> 02:32:20,003
JON: And then one of the guys actually jumped in
and it absorbed him.

1867
02:32:20,003 --> 02:32:23,062
LAURA: Did it look like he was in pain?

1868
02:32:23,062 --> 02:32:33,163
JON: No, it just went (sucking sound). And he was
gone. And so I had to get out of there. By then,

1869
02:32:33,163 --> 02:32:39,645
my buddies, they were dead and taken away. So I
was the only lone survivor, and that's why you can

1870
02:32:39,645 --> 02:32:44,317
count on me the most. He knew I would survive. Is
that why you sent them?

1871
02:32:44,317 --> 02:32:46,358
Because you knew only I would survive?

1872
02:32:46,358 --> 02:32:49,987
SAM: I assumed that... Yes?

1873
02:32:49,987 --> 02:32:55,298
JON: See, I'm the best. So that's what I saw.

1874
02:32:55,298 --> 02:32:58,213
LAURA: Was it a lot of guys?

1875
02:32:58,213 --> 02:33:03,148
JON: There was a whole bunch of these guys in
robes. It was really creepy.

1876
02:33:03,148 --> 02:33:05,278
SAM: And dark hoods, executioner-style.

1877
02:33:05,278 --> 02:33:12,126
JON: Yes, matching robes, and I got a really
creepy feeling when I saw it, besides being in the

1878
02:33:12,126 --> 02:33:13,487
middle of a mountain.

1879
02:33:13,487 --> 02:33:14,727
LIAM: Roughly how many?

1880
02:33:14,727 --> 02:33:16,433
JON: Oh, I don't know. I mean, it was dark.

1881
02:33:16,433 --> 02:33:17,694
LIAM: More than us?

1882
02:33:17,694 --> 02:33:18,887
JON: More than you.

1883
02:33:18,887 --> 02:33:22,096
MATT: When you were there, it would've been
about 12 or 13 of them there.

1884
02:33:22,096 --> 02:33:23,814
TALIESIN: That's a lot of matching robes.

1885
02:33:23,814 --> 02:33:28,374
LIAM: And they all looked the same? Nobody looked
a little more important than the others?

1886
02:33:28,374 --> 02:33:31,066
JON: I couldn't see their faces, I couldn't see.
They were all covered in these robes.

1887
02:33:31,066 --> 02:33:32,443
It felt like...

1888
02:33:32,443 --> 02:33:34,513
LAURA: How long ago was this?

1889
02:33:34,513 --> 02:33:38,831
JON: This was a couple months ago. I mean, you
know, I lost track of time when we

1890
02:33:38,831 --> 02:33:40,108
were on the ship.

1891
02:33:40,108 --> 02:33:41,815
SAM: It's a couple weeks.

1892
02:33:41,815 --> 02:33:46,024
(laughter)

1893
02:33:46,024 --> 02:33:51,131
JON: I was asleep for most of the ship ride. I was
pretty sick.

1894
02:33:51,131 --> 02:33:53,851
LAURA: I get sick, too. I understand.

1895
02:33:53,851 --> 02:33:57,670
SAM: It was hard to tell. His face is always
green, so we couldn't really tell.

1896
02:33:57,670 --> 02:34:03,827
JON: You guys were good. You guys gave me all the
leftover stew that you had.

1897
02:34:03,827 --> 02:34:15,054
LAURA: So, wait, and then you saw Allura there?
That's bullshit?

1898
02:34:15,054 --> 02:34:17,369
MATT: No, that was all bullshit.

1899
02:34:17,369 --> 02:34:23,769
SAM: No, I'm sorry. I lied to you.

1900
02:34:23,769 --> 02:34:28,238
LAURA: Oh. Oh, you suddenly lied to us. Wow, I
feel so shocked.

1901
02:34:28,238 --> 02:34:33,725
SAM: I didn't know. Listen, I wanted to tell you
this information, but I didn't know how to do so.

1902
02:34:33,725 --> 02:34:42,762
I still don't know what's going to happen. You all
might draw your knives and kill me right now, I

1903
02:34:42,762 --> 02:34:44,420
just wanted to get this information...

1904
02:34:44,420 --> 02:34:46,020
JON: No, they won't kill you. I promise.

1905
02:34:46,020 --> 02:34:46,987
SAM: Thank you.

1906
02:34:46,987 --> 02:34:48,680
LIAM: No one wants to kill you.

1907
02:34:48,680 --> 02:34:49,836
ASHLEY: Well, that's debatable.

1908
02:34:49,836 --> 02:34:51,682
TALIESIN: You tried to get me to give you my gun
designs?

1909
02:34:51,682 --> 02:34:53,197
SAM: Just some ammo.

1910
02:34:53,197 --> 02:34:54,942
TALIESIN: For what?

1911
02:34:54,942 --> 02:34:56,272
SAM: For my gun that I have.

1912
02:34:56,272 --> 02:34:57,520
TALIESIN: You have a gun?

1913
02:34:57,520 --> 02:34:58,467
SAM: Yeah.

1914
02:34:58,467 --> 02:34:59,622
MARISHA: He stole it from you.

1915
02:34:59,622 --> 02:35:00,870
LAURA: Remember?

1916
02:35:00,870 --> 02:35:02,520
MARISHA: No, you gave it to him!

1917
02:35:02,520 --> 02:35:04,589
TALIESIN: No, I didn't give it to him.

1918
02:35:04,589 --> 02:35:06,250
JON: Do you want it back?

1919
02:35:06,250 --> 02:35:07,604
SAM: No, please don't give it back.

1920
02:35:07,604 --> 02:35:12,755
LIAM: What's your best-case scenario here? What
did you hope would happen? You'd come and tell us

1921
02:35:12,755 --> 02:35:14,568
these things and then what happens next?

1922
02:35:14,568 --> 02:35:16,194
SAM: You would go investigate.

1923
02:35:16,194 --> 02:35:17,251
LIAM: With you?

1924
02:35:17,251 --> 02:35:21,824
SAM: No. You would go investigate and I would go
back to my job.

1925
02:35:21,824 --> 02:35:30,787
MARISHA: So you're just here to be an errand boy.
That's all you want. To help us out.

1926
02:35:30,787 --> 02:35:32,368
SAM: Yes.

1927
02:35:32,368 --> 02:35:40,344
MARISHA: You traveled to a separate hemisphere to
be a messenger.

1928
02:35:40,344 --> 02:35:42,376
JON: It was only a couple weeks.

1929
02:35:42,376 --> 02:35:44,260
ASHLEY: Can I insight-check him?

1930
02:35:44,260 --> 02:35:46,234
MATT: Sure.

1931
02:35:46,234 --> 02:35:55,052
ASHLEY: 23.

1932
02:35:55,052 --> 02:35:56,926
SAM: 37.

1933
02:35:56,926 --> 02:35:58,713
LIAM: He's back.

1934
02:35:58,713 --> 02:36:01,084
MATT: Hard to read.

1935
02:36:01,084 --> 02:36:20,618
SAM: I've thought about you all a lot, during this
year, and I owe you all an apology for leaving

1936
02:36:20,618 --> 02:36:28,766
you, and I don't know what I'll ever do to make it
up to you.

1937
02:36:28,766 --> 02:36:35,884
LAURA: We deserved it.

1938
02:36:35,884 --> 02:36:37,493
SAM: No, you didn't.

1939
02:36:37,493 --> 02:36:40,245
TALIESIN: No, we didn't.

1940
02:36:40,245 --> 02:36:51,594
SAM: There was a night. There was a night early
on, a few weeks after I left you. It was just me

1941
02:36:51,594 --> 02:37:00,383
and Kaylie by a campfire, and she was asking me
about myself and my life, and she has this thing.

1942
02:37:00,383 --> 02:37:10,188
I don't know if it's a spell or a special ability,
but she can always tell when I'm lying. She's the

1943
02:37:10,188 --> 02:37:19,022
only one. And I was trying to spin some sort of
bullshit to her about my past, and she called me

1944
02:37:19,022 --> 02:37:31,337
on it, and said, the truth. Let me hear it. And I
told her everything. I told her about all the

1945
02:37:31,337 --> 02:37:43,087
lives I had ruined, and about the women, and about
all the other Kaylies out there that I know of,

1946
02:37:43,087 --> 02:37:59,575
and the ones that I can only assume exist. And
everything. And she spat at me, and she gave me

1947
02:37:59,575 --> 02:38:13,894
this scar with her knife, and she left. And I
thought that was it. I had ruined it. But before

1948
02:38:13,894 --> 02:38:24,506
dawn, she came back, and she unrolled her bedding,
and she went to sleep, and woke up the next

1949
02:38:24,506 --> 02:38:36,186
morning, and said, what's for breakfast, Dad? And
I realized that I've been wrong, that you don't

1950
02:38:36,186 --> 02:38:47,719
leave your shit behind and keep going. You take it
with you, and the ones you surround yourself with

1951
02:38:47,719 --> 02:39:00,947
better get used to the smell. And she stayed with
me despite all my flaws. And when I left you all,

1952
02:39:00,947 --> 02:39:14,553
it was the first time that I had realized that you
were all really flawed people. Really flawed

1953
02:39:14,553 --> 02:39:29,244
people. And I left. And I did not come back. And I
was wrong, because family sticks around even if

1954
02:39:29,244 --> 02:39:36,281
you kind of hate the other person. And I didn't. I
betrayed you.

1955
02:39:36,281 --> 02:39:42,118
And I've lived with that shame for a year.

1956
02:39:42,118 --> 02:39:52,156
LIAM: Are you happier now?

1957
02:39:52,156 --> 02:40:01,940
SAM: Well, I have a purpose. I have a job. People
depend on me.

1958
02:40:01,940 --> 02:40:06,230
Strong people, like this guy. That's you.

1959
02:40:06,230 --> 02:40:07,425
JON: Me?

1960
02:40:07,425 --> 02:40:16,979
SAM: Yeah. And smart people, and Kaylie. And I'm a
pretty big shot.

1961
02:40:16,979 --> 02:40:19,646
JON: You're not so big anymore.

1962
02:40:19,646 --> 02:40:21,781
SAM: Well, it's a metaphor.

1963
02:40:21,781 --> 02:40:24,242
LAURA: You always were.

1964
02:40:24,242 --> 02:40:26,741
LIAM: That doesn't sound too bad to me.

1965
02:40:26,741 --> 02:40:38,448
MARISHA: Did you not feel like you had a purpose
when you were with Vox Machina? I'm not judging

1966
02:40:38,448 --> 02:40:41,502
you in the moment.

1967
02:40:41,502 --> 02:40:50,878
SAM: I knew I was part of something, but I always
thought I was... I've been a storyteller, but I

1968
02:40:50,878 --> 02:41:00,537
didn't think I was part of the story. And for the
last year I've been the story, and it's felt good.

1969
02:41:00,537 --> 02:41:12,437
But I'm back, and I've given you the information,
and you can tell me what you'd like me to do next.

1970
02:41:12,437 --> 02:41:25,471
MARISHA: You know, there is a point that we are
all family, but we are also all friends, and there

1971
02:41:25,471 --> 02:41:33,560
is that old saying, be careful of the friends that
drag you down. Maybe we were dragging you down.

1972
02:41:33,560 --> 02:41:54,069
TALIESIN: I'm going to put some pistol shot in a
small bag. What's Kaylie's mother's name? What is

1973
02:41:54,069 --> 02:42:03,765
it? I toss it to him. Dick. And I leave. For the
record, it's Sybil.

1974
02:42:03,765 --> 02:42:18,428
ASHLEY: I think I hear something. Do you hear
that? It sounds like small little violins that I

1975
02:42:18,428 --> 02:42:21,314
hear. Do you hear that?

1976
02:42:21,314 --> 02:42:22,877
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1977
02:42:22,877 --> 02:42:26,809
JON: I don't hear anything.

1978
02:42:26,809 --> 02:42:39,156
(laughter)

1979
02:42:39,156 --> 02:42:47,497
ASHLEY: I forgot I had to talk to Percy about
something. Bye. Good to see you.

1980
02:42:47,497 --> 02:42:56,600
MARISHA: You know, you've broken a lot of hearts,
Scanlan. I think you're still a heartbreaker. And

1981
02:42:56,600 --> 02:42:58,688
I leave with them.

1982
02:42:58,688 --> 02:43:05,086
LAURA: I think they'll come around.

1983
02:43:05,086 --> 02:43:07,253
SAM: I doubt it.

1984
02:43:07,253 --> 02:43:09,631
LIAM: No, I think she's right.

1985
02:43:09,631 --> 02:43:14,853
LAURA: I think more than anything they've just
missed you, darling.

1986
02:43:14,853 --> 02:43:27,467
LIAM: Can I tell you a secret? All this last year,
I've known we would see you again.

1987
02:43:27,467 --> 02:43:34,280
LAURA: He's full of shit. He totally said that you
were never coming back. I knew.

1988
02:43:34,280 --> 02:43:39,829
LIAM: It's good to see you again.

1989
02:43:39,829 --> 02:43:54,860
SAM: It's good to see you all. I don't really know
what to do now. I have... I really don't know what

1990
02:43:54,860 --> 02:44:07,478
to do now. And that's a new feeling for me. I have
information. We should travel back to Ank'harel so

1991
02:44:07,478 --> 02:44:09,255
I can show you.

1992
02:44:09,255 --> 02:44:10,653
LAURA: Of course.

1993
02:44:10,653 --> 02:44:22,174
SAM: And maybe then you all can decide what to do.
Whether to part ways, as friends or enemies. But I

1994
02:44:22,174 --> 02:44:29,598
can help you. I know people there, and I can get
you safe passage, fine accommodations, the best

1995
02:44:29,598 --> 02:44:37,035
food, even some realistic-looking antiques.

1996
02:44:37,035 --> 02:44:40,060
LAURA: Ooh. I like it.

1997
02:44:40,060 --> 02:44:45,411
SAM: Grog?

1998
02:44:45,411 --> 02:44:47,479
TRAVIS: I leave.

1999
02:44:47,479 --> 02:44:50,433
LIAM: Give him time.

2000
02:44:50,433 --> 02:45:03,883
LAURA: Scanlan. I think you need to talk to them.
Pike didn't get to say a word to you when you

2001
02:45:03,883 --> 02:45:06,880
left. Grog was...

2002
02:45:06,880 --> 02:45:10,521
LIAM: Grog.

2003
02:45:10,521 --> 02:45:13,606
LAURA: Grog was hurt.

2004
02:45:13,606 --> 02:45:21,959
SAM: All right. Should I go now? I should give
them some time.

2005
02:45:21,959 --> 02:45:24,919
LAURA: Maybe a little bit of breathing room, and
then, yeah.

2006
02:45:24,919 --> 02:45:26,803
SAM: Okay.

2007
02:45:26,803 --> 02:45:28,492
LIAM: Little steps.

2008
02:45:28,492 --> 02:45:34,748
SAM: Lionel. Thanks for sitting through all this.
I really appreciate it.

2009
02:45:34,748 --> 02:45:38,269
JON: I was just telling stories in my head again.

2010
02:45:38,269 --> 02:45:42,083
SAM: Oh, really? The good ones or the bad ones?

2011
02:45:42,083 --> 02:45:49,268
JON: The bad ones. They just pop in there.

2012
02:45:49,268 --> 02:45:53,624
SAM: I'm sorry. I know you've had a bit of a rough
life.

2013
02:45:53,624 --> 02:46:00,792
JON: Are you wanting me to talk about my life?

2014
02:46:00,792 --> 02:46:07,103
SAM: No, no, no, you don't have to. We're already
weird right now, so I'm cool.

2015
02:46:07,103 --> 02:46:12,793
MARISHA: Can we go to sleep now?

2016
02:46:12,793 --> 02:46:14,046
MATT: Okay.

2017
02:46:14,046 --> 02:46:15,698
SAM: It's eight AM.

2018
02:46:15,698 --> 02:46:19,391
MARISHA: Everyone's emotionally tired.

2019
02:46:19,391 --> 02:46:20,596
MATT: Right.

2020
02:46:20,596 --> 02:46:23,225
TALIESIN: So are we going to see an orb in the
morning?

2021
02:46:23,225 --> 02:46:33,297
MATT: It's midday at this point, so you guys all
go to your separate rooms and take time to

2022
02:46:33,297 --> 02:46:36,971
yourselves independently, converse amongst
individually.

2023
02:46:36,971 --> 02:46:39,407
TALIESIN: Pike, Grog, do you want a drink?

2024
02:46:39,407 --> 02:46:40,341
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2025
02:46:40,341 --> 02:46:41,258
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2026
02:46:41,258 --> 02:46:43,648
LIAM: Oh, I was just about to ask you the same
thing.

2027
02:46:43,648 --> 02:46:49,744
LAURA: Oh. Well, I mean, yeah.

2028
02:46:49,744 --> 02:46:51,902
TALIESIN: Grog, I want to go find that orb.

2029
02:46:51,902 --> 02:46:59,842
MARISHA: What? The orb in Ank'harel? Are we all
talking over our headpieces?

2030
02:46:59,842 --> 02:47:01,366
I think that's what we're doing.

2031
02:47:01,366 --> 02:47:05,143
LAURA: I'm sure Scanlan still has his. He can
probably hear us talking right now.

2032
02:47:05,143 --> 02:47:11,167
ASHLEY: Scanlan, can you hear me now? I take out
my earpiece.

2033
02:47:11,167 --> 02:47:14,381
MARISHA: He's a dick, he can hear us. I know the
range of these things.

2034
02:47:14,381 --> 02:47:17,035
TRAVIS: Yeah, I take off my earpiece, too.

2035
02:47:17,035 --> 02:47:29,006
TALIESIN: I kind of want to go work the blood out,
Scanlan or not. I like Lionel. He's funny.

2036
02:47:29,006 --> 02:47:32,818
LIAM: We're all agreed on that, at least.

2037
02:47:32,818 --> 02:47:42,108
MARISHA: Are we supposed to be angry, or sad, or
happy? I don't know what all these feelings are

2038
02:47:42,108 --> 02:47:43,324
all at once.

2039
02:47:43,324 --> 02:47:44,706
TALIESIN: You can have them all at once.

2040
02:47:44,706 --> 02:47:45,620
MARISHA: Can I?

2041
02:47:45,620 --> 02:47:46,948
TALIESIN: Yes. They're not exclusive.

2042
02:47:46,948 --> 02:47:49,990
TRAVIS: Percy. Where would someone like him stay
in Whitestone?

2043
02:47:49,990 --> 02:47:53,487
SAM: Where are you guys right now, by the way?

2044
02:47:53,487 --> 02:47:56,557
TALIESIN: We just went to the closest pub.

2045
02:47:56,557 --> 02:47:58,155
SAM: Is Lionel with them?

2046
02:47:58,155 --> 02:48:01,150
MATT: Lionel's left behind with you unless you
gave him instructions otherwise.

2047
02:48:01,150 --> 02:48:02,317
He's your bodyguard.

2048
02:48:02,317 --> 02:48:07,362
SAM: Would you like to go with them or stay with
me in my sad room?

2049
02:48:07,362 --> 02:48:11,709
JON: I'll go with them.

2050
02:48:11,709 --> 02:48:14,536
(laughter)

2051
02:48:14,536 --> 02:48:20,016
MATT: You guys sit down, you get your drinks, and
right as you're about to have this conversation,

2052
02:48:20,016 --> 02:48:27,966
Lionel just moseys up to the table. The barmaid's
like, "Um..."

2053
02:48:27,966 --> 02:48:30,756
TALIESIN: He learned a lot about his employer
today, I have no problem with him being here.

2054
02:48:30,756 --> 02:48:32,468
MARISHA: Yeah, he needs a stiff drink.

2055
02:48:32,468 --> 02:48:36,747
MATT: "Can I get you some wine, ale, beer? What
would you like?"

2056
02:48:36,747 --> 02:48:38,494
TALIESIN: Fruit juice, maybe?

2057
02:48:38,494 --> 02:48:42,024
JON: Do you have chocolate milk?

2058
02:48:42,024 --> 02:48:43,962
TALIESIN: We do have hot cocoa.

2059
02:48:43,962 --> 02:48:46,867
MATT: "I'll see what I can do." She walks away.

2060
02:48:46,867 --> 02:48:49,388
TALIESIN: Hot cocoa is doable. We've done hot
cocoa before.

2061
02:48:49,388 --> 02:48:51,398
MARISHA: And security blankets.

2062
02:48:51,398 --> 02:48:56,010
TALIESIN: It's the orange blanket wrap. Grog.

2063
02:48:56,010 --> 02:48:57,551
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

2064
02:48:57,551 --> 02:49:01,700
TALIESIN: What do you think?

2065
02:49:01,700 --> 02:49:07,378
TRAVIS: Lionel. Real strong, are you?

2066
02:49:07,378 --> 02:49:13,487
JON: I'm really strong. I don't know a lot of
things, but I think I know that.

2067
02:49:13,487 --> 02:49:18,371
TRAVIS: Aes. Does he depend on you?

2068
02:49:18,371 --> 02:49:20,204
JON: He does.

2069
02:49:20,204 --> 02:49:23,034
TRAVIS: How long have you known him?

2070
02:49:23,034 --> 02:49:31,528
JON: Probably about... Well, I'm not really good
with years, or days or months, but probably a lot

2071
02:49:31,528 --> 02:49:34,841
of days. Maybe a year.

2072
02:49:34,841 --> 02:49:39,959
TRAVIS: How strong do you think you are?

2073
02:49:39,959 --> 02:49:45,699
JON: The other day I tried to high-five a--

2074
02:49:45,699 --> 02:49:49,110
TRAVIS: I reach across the table and I just punch
him in the face.

2075
02:49:49,110 --> 02:49:50,696
MATT: All right. Roll for an attack.

2076
02:49:50,696 --> 02:49:54,745
LIAM: I love the malice radiating this way, and
the absolute lack of recognition.

2077
02:49:54,745 --> 02:49:59,076
MARISHA: It stops here. It stops at the camera
line.

2078
02:49:59,076 --> 02:50:00,873
TRAVIS: 24.

2079
02:50:00,873 --> 02:50:02,227
MATT: So what's your armor class?

2080
02:50:02,227 --> 02:50:03,319
JON: 18.

2081
02:50:03,319 --> 02:50:12,924
MATT: 18. Go ahead and roll, for this here, I'd
say a d4. Why not? Because you guys are pretty

2082
02:50:12,924 --> 02:50:15,266
beefy. A d4 and add your strength modifier.

2083
02:50:15,266 --> 02:50:18,721
TRAVIS: Nine. Ten, sorry.

2084
02:50:18,721 --> 02:50:24,035
MATT: He comes across and cold-cocks you in the
chin. You take ten points of damage from a single

2085
02:50:24,035 --> 02:50:33,226
punch. You feel a looseness to one of your back
teeth, and the white hits you, and your vision

2086
02:50:33,226 --> 02:50:39,556
clears for a second, and you look over and you see
the beefy, gray-skinned goliath, his fist still

2087
02:50:39,556 --> 02:50:43,119
extended as he pulls it back, staring right at
you.

2088
02:50:43,119 --> 02:50:45,986
JON: Whoa, that hurt!

2089
02:50:45,986 --> 02:50:53,199
TRAVIS: Yeah. This bar, there's a lot more where
that came from. All you can eat, yeah.

2090
02:50:53,199 --> 02:50:58,633
JON: Show me! That was awesome!

2091
02:50:58,633 --> 02:51:00,000
TRAVIS: Rage.

2092
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:01,933
LAURA: Oh no! Oh no.

2093
02:51:01,933 --> 02:51:03,300
TRAVIS: Total rage.

2094
02:51:03,300 --> 02:51:04,689
LIAM: We're not here.

2095
02:51:04,689 --> 02:51:05,680
LAURA: Yes, we are.

2096
02:51:05,680 --> 02:51:07,271
LIAM: I thought you and I-- I asked...

2097
02:51:07,271 --> 02:51:09,992
LAURA: I thought we all said we went.

2098
02:51:09,992 --> 02:51:13,085
LIAM: They all left, we were behind. This is the
problem when

2099
02:51:13,085 --> 02:51:15,085
everybody's thoughts are in different heads.

2100
02:51:15,085 --> 02:51:18,134
MATT: Do you guys want to be in the same bar or
not, that's my question right now.

2101
02:51:18,134 --> 02:51:21,091
LAURA: We don't have to be. Okay, then no. We're
not there, then.

2102
02:51:21,091 --> 02:51:25,095
MATT: Okay, so you're not there. This is happening
between you guys. Grog goes into a rage.

2103
02:51:25,095 --> 02:51:26,563
TRAVIS: Are we at a bar? At a table?

2104
02:51:26,563 --> 02:51:30,758
MATT: You guys are in a tavern. There's a few
people, and as soon as that punch happened, a few

2105
02:51:30,758 --> 02:51:34,524
people were like, "Ooh!" in the background, and as
soon as you stand up and go into a rage, people

2106
02:51:34,524 --> 02:51:37,166
begin to back out of the way. Tables are being
pushed to the side.

2107
02:51:37,166 --> 02:51:39,723
TALIESIN: I'm pulling gold out to pay for this.

2108
02:51:39,723 --> 02:51:46,934
JON: I think it's awesome. I'm like, I want to
fight back. But not-- it's play for me, now.

2109
02:51:46,934 --> 02:51:49,381
MATT: So then, I want you guys both to roll
initiative.

2110
02:51:49,381 --> 02:51:51,813
MARISHA: Grog, don't kill him! Grog, don't kill
him!

2111
02:51:51,813 --> 02:51:57,967
JON: What's my initiative? Oh, plus one. So what
is that, a six? That's a nine. So ten?

2112
02:51:57,967 --> 02:51:59,137
TALIESIN: Yep.

2113
02:51:59,137 --> 02:52:00,133
JON: Ten.

2114
02:52:00,133 --> 02:52:01,163
TRAVIS: 14.

2115
02:52:01,163 --> 02:52:07,669
MATT: All right, so as you get up, you're like
"All right!" And this guy-- you're used to being

2116
02:52:07,669 --> 02:52:10,620
the biggest guy in the room. He's a little bigger
than you.

2117
02:52:10,620 --> 02:52:15,145
SAM: I, Taryon Darrington, rolled a 14.

2118
02:52:15,145 --> 02:52:16,528
JON: You're not here.

2119
02:52:16,528 --> 02:52:17,767
SAM: I'm with you guys.

2120
02:52:17,767 --> 02:52:19,381
MATT: He did come with them, yeah.

2121
02:52:19,381 --> 02:52:21,052
JON: I thought you said-- Oh, Taryon.

2122
02:52:21,052 --> 02:52:27,065
SAM: I'm Taryon Darrington. I stand up and I say,
I've seen this before. He will attack brutally.

2123
02:52:27,065 --> 02:52:40,644
Drink this. And I shove a Swift Step draught in
his mouth. You can run 80 feet now every turn.

2124
02:52:40,644 --> 02:52:44,492
MATT: All right, so you can move pretty fast if
you want to.

2125
02:52:44,492 --> 02:52:50,197
MARISHA: Keyleth is just watching intently, and
more importantly watching Grog, making sure he

2126
02:52:50,197 --> 02:52:55,131
doesn't actually beat him to death. We'll stop
this if it gets bad.

2127
02:52:55,131 --> 02:52:57,582
ASHLEY: I take a seat on a bar stool and just
start drinking.

2128
02:52:57,582 --> 02:52:59,452
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're sitting next to you.

2129
02:52:59,452 --> 02:53:03,865
MATT: As you're preparing, Grog, this guy who's a
little larger than you are, and as soon as he

2130
02:53:03,865 --> 02:53:06,780
stands up you're like, "Oh!" And he's quicker than
you thought. Grog, what are you gonna do?

2131
02:53:06,780 --> 02:53:09,194
TRAVIS: Are we at a table or the bar?

2132
02:53:09,194 --> 02:53:10,512
MATT: You are, yeah.

2133
02:53:10,512 --> 02:53:12,680
TRAVIS: At a table or at the bar?

2134
02:53:12,680 --> 02:53:14,974
MATT: Oh, you were at a table within the bar.

2135
02:53:14,974 --> 02:53:20,037
TRAVIS: Magnificent. I flip up the table in my
hands and I smash it over his head.

2136
02:53:20,037 --> 02:53:22,184
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.

2137
02:53:22,184 --> 02:53:25,690
TALIESIN: That doesn't belong to you. That's
coming out of my coffer.

2138
02:53:25,690 --> 02:53:27,080
TRAVIS: 25.

2139
02:53:27,080 --> 02:53:32,131
MATT: 25, okay. That hits. Go ahead and roll
another d4.

2140
02:53:32,131 --> 02:53:34,778
JON: So I'm quick but not that quick.

2141
02:53:34,778 --> 02:53:36,693
TRAVIS: 12.

2142
02:53:36,693 --> 02:53:43,375
MATT: 12 points of bludgeoning damage to you as he
smashes the table over your head. Lionel, the wood

2143
02:53:43,375 --> 02:53:48,950
splinters and breaks around you, and you hear the
crack of the broken wood, and you can feel the

2144
02:53:48,950 --> 02:53:53,697
splinters shred across the edge of your shoulders,
causing the burst of warmth and blood begin to

2145
02:53:53,697 --> 02:53:59,410
flow to the top of your shoulders, and you're
like, "Oh, this is exhilarating." All right.

2146
02:53:59,410 --> 02:54:02,101
That's your turn? All right, Lionel, you're up.

2147
02:54:02,101 --> 02:54:04,693
JON: Okay! To fight?

2148
02:54:04,693 --> 02:54:06,290
TALIESIN: You can do anything you like.

2149
02:54:06,290 --> 02:54:09,862
JON: Yeah, I definitely want to fight back because
this is fun.

2150
02:54:09,862 --> 02:54:12,234
TALIESIN: Cool. Here to help.

2151
02:54:12,234 --> 02:54:14,890
MATT: It's a bonus action to rage if you want.

2152
02:54:14,890 --> 02:54:17,083
JON: Yeah, but I like the-- What?

2153
02:54:17,083 --> 02:54:19,030
MATT: It's a bonus action to rage, if you want to
do that.

2154
02:54:19,030 --> 02:54:24,321
JON: Yeah, I saw his rage, and I-- no, I'm going
to rage, because I want to mimic. Like, hey, I can

2155
02:54:24,321 --> 02:54:28,468
rage, too! Watch this! So do I roll that?

2156
02:54:28,468 --> 02:54:32,927
MATT: No, no. You're now raging, so now your
muscles swell, the veins bulge out, with this big

2157
02:54:32,927 --> 02:54:38,854
grin on his mouth. When Grog's raging, Grog's
angry rage. He's happy rage.

2158
02:54:38,854 --> 02:54:44,776
JON: Oh, check it out! You can see my veins go
(jingling).

2159
02:54:44,776 --> 02:54:47,443
MATT: So what do you want to do for your turn?

2160
02:54:47,443 --> 02:54:57,520
JON: I want to go and do... So I run up to him,
and I go to do the really cool thing I heard in a

2161
02:54:57,520 --> 02:55:02,619
cool story where I twist up my fist and I go
(whoosh) (pow). I've always wanted to try this,

2162
02:55:02,619 --> 02:55:05,420
and this looks like a better time than ever to try
it out.

2163
02:55:05,420 --> 02:55:10,779
MATT: So, roll for an attack and it's plus ten.
We'll say plus ten for this.

2164
02:55:10,779 --> 02:55:15,389
JON: 17.

2165
02:55:15,389 --> 02:55:20,425
MATT: What's your AC? 17? Go ahead and roll a d4
and add your strength modifier,

2166
02:55:20,425 --> 02:55:22,674
which I think is a plus five.

2167
02:55:22,674 --> 02:55:25,750
JON: And I am looking for what?

2168
02:55:25,930 --> 02:55:28,861
TALIESIN: And you add five for your strength, so
you got--

2169
02:55:28,861 --> 02:55:30,878
JON: So, eight.

2170
02:55:30,878 --> 02:55:33,494
MATT: So, eight points of bludgeoning damage. You
take four, Grog.

2171
02:55:33,494 --> 02:55:38,409
SAM: Plus three damage.

2172
02:55:38,409 --> 02:55:43,908
MATT: Oh, plus three damage on top of that! So,
eight, so 11. Sorry, you take five.

2173
02:55:43,908 --> 02:55:47,886
SAM: He takes half-damage. But you did great.

2174
02:55:47,886 --> 02:55:51,090
MATT: You're both raging. You're both taking the
lesser damage of each hit.

2175
02:55:51,090 --> 02:55:55,878
SAM: You get two attacks, but you're raging, so
you get a third attack?

2176
02:55:55,878 --> 02:56:00,092
MATT: No, Grog has that ability. He has a
different-- he's not a frenzy barbarian.

2177
02:56:00,146 --> 02:56:01,634
SAM: But he does get two attacks.

2178
02:56:01,634 --> 02:56:03,381
MATT: He does get two attacks. So you get to
attack again.

2179
02:56:03,381 --> 02:56:09,800
JON: This time, I run around him because I'm super
quick and like using this new speed I've never

2180
02:56:09,800 --> 02:56:15,969
experienced. And I jump on his back from around
and I try to choke him.

2181
02:56:15,969 --> 02:56:17,396
TALIESIN: Grapple.

2182
02:56:17,396 --> 02:56:19,449
MATT: Go ahead and roll an athletics check.

2183
02:56:19,449 --> 02:56:24,181
TALIESIN: That plus ten.

2184
02:56:24,181 --> 02:56:27,432
JON: 23.

2185
02:56:27,432 --> 02:56:31,119
MATT: You go ahead and roll an athletics or
acrobatics check to resist it.

2186
02:56:31,119 --> 02:56:33,303
SAM: Oh, shit, his is huge.

2187
02:56:33,303 --> 02:56:35,976
TRAVIS: That's not great. That's a 14.

2188
02:56:36,052 --> 02:56:42,117
MATT: 14. You leap up behind him and put your arm
up under. His jaw's like concrete, but you still

2189
02:56:42,117 --> 02:56:47,271
find the one soft part and jam your bulging
forearm up into that space and you feel the

2190
02:56:47,271 --> 02:56:49,907
windpipe (choke) close and clench in.

2191
02:56:49,907 --> 02:56:51,540
TRAVIS: (choking sounds)

2192
02:56:51,540 --> 02:56:55,415
MATT: And your really, really fast feet are now
dangling about two inches off the ground as you're

2193
02:56:55,415 --> 02:56:58,499
on his back right now. That's the end of your
turn. You're currently grappled, Grog,

2194
02:56:58,499 --> 02:57:00,490
what are you going to do?

2195
02:57:00,490 --> 02:57:03,303
TRAVIS: (choking sounds) I'm going to put it in
reverse straight towards the wall.

2196
02:57:03,303 --> 02:57:10,252
MATT: Go ahead and roll. Are you just going to
stay holding on as you're doing it?

2197
02:57:10,252 --> 02:57:15,759
JON: Yeah. Yeah. Because this is the first
piggyback he's ever had.

2198
02:57:15,759 --> 02:57:21,628
MATT: It's kind of fun for a second before you hit
the wood. Wham! I'll say, go ahead and roll a

2199
02:57:21,628 --> 02:57:27,930
strength saving throw to see if you can maintain
the hold after the slam.

2200
02:57:27,930 --> 02:57:29,133
JON: 18.

2201
02:57:29,133 --> 02:57:33,482
MATT: 18. Okay, I'd say that's enough for the
strength of the hold. So he keeps holding on after

2202
02:57:33,482 --> 02:57:35,647
the slam in the back. Anything else you're going
to do with your turn?

2203
02:57:35,647 --> 02:57:39,702
TRAVIS: My action. I take my elbow, raise it up
and drive it into his ribs.

2204
02:57:39,702 --> 02:57:41,377
MATT: Okay, roll for an attack.

2205
02:57:41,377 --> 02:57:44,808
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's a 28.

2206
02:57:44,808 --> 02:57:46,839
MATT: Yeah, so 1d4.

2207
02:57:46,839 --> 02:57:50,380
SAM: Now he has to roll damage.

2208
02:57:50,380 --> 02:57:52,370
TRAVIS: Ten.

2209
02:57:52,370 --> 02:58:01,164
MATT: So, ten damage halved to five and you have
an ability as reaction, if you remember. It's in

2210
02:58:01,164 --> 02:58:04,534
your totem abilities that you can use as a
reaction.

2211
02:58:04,534 --> 02:58:07,806
JON: Oh! Off a Duck's Back!

2212
02:58:07,806 --> 02:58:09,904
MARISHA: Off a Duck's Back?!

2213
02:58:09,904 --> 02:58:17,379
JON: The duck is my animal totem, you guys. I can
explain that later.

2214
02:58:17,379 --> 02:58:23,267
MATT: So, as you go to slam him with your elbow,
you hit, but you feel like your elbow slips off

2215
02:58:23,267 --> 02:58:28,526
his body and doesn't quite do the damage you hoped
it would. So you take two points of damage.

2216
02:58:28,526 --> 02:58:30,185
JON: Sweet!

2217
02:58:30,185 --> 02:58:32,303
TALIESIN: Covered in duck butter.

2218
02:58:32,303 --> 02:58:36,053
LIAM: It's the saxophone player from Lost Boys:
greased up!

2219
02:58:36,053 --> 02:58:41,451
TRAVIS: For my second attack, can I throw my head
back in a headbutt?

2220
02:58:41,451 --> 02:58:43,267
MATT: Go for it, roll for an attack.

2221
02:58:43,267 --> 02:58:45,323
TRAVIS: Yeah, 23.

2222
02:58:45,323 --> 02:58:48,640
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll 1d4 plus
strength.

2223
02:58:48,640 --> 02:58:50,029
TRAVIS: 11.

2224
02:58:50,029 --> 02:58:55,105
MATT: 11. So you take five points of bludgeoning
damage, because you can only use that reaction

2225
02:58:55,105 --> 02:58:56,427
once per round.

2226
02:58:56,427 --> 02:58:59,770
JON: I took five points.

2227
02:58:59,770 --> 02:59:03,227
MATT: You have to use an action to try and break
free of a grapple. So you took five, yeah. So

2228
02:59:03,227 --> 02:59:06,502
now it's back to your turn. He slammed you into
the wall, he's elbowed you twice in the stomach,

2229
02:59:06,502 --> 02:59:08,869
you've resisted some of it, you're still holding
him there.

2230
02:59:08,869 --> 02:59:10,343
JON: Okay.

2231
02:59:10,343 --> 02:59:18,305
MATT: So if you wanted to, because of one of the
feats you have, you could turn that into a pin if

2232
02:59:18,305 --> 02:59:19,509
you wanted to.

2233
02:59:19,509 --> 02:59:20,965
JON: One of the feats I have?

2234
02:59:20,965 --> 02:59:22,547
MATT: Yeah, it's on the bottom.

2235
02:59:22,547 --> 02:59:25,758
JON: Now this is turning into a wrestling match, I
like that.

2236
02:59:25,758 --> 02:59:31,802
MATT: Or you could just keep whaling on him.

2237
02:59:31,802 --> 02:59:37,925
JON: I want to take him out. Not kill. He's just
having fun.

2238
02:59:37,925 --> 02:59:42,163
MARISHA: It's going down in the Whole Foods
parking lot!

2239
02:59:42,163 --> 02:59:45,728
JON: So I'm still hanging on him.

2240
02:59:45,817 --> 02:59:49,030
MATT: Yeah, you're holding onto him by throat, he
slammed you against the wall, he's elbowed you in

2241
02:59:49,030 --> 02:59:50,516
the stomach twice.

2242
02:59:50,516 --> 02:59:55,544
JON: I'm, again, having fun, superspeed. I'm going
to, while holding onto him, crawl up his back and

2243
02:59:55,544 --> 03:00:01,133
jump over and try to land and try to do the move
where I do that and throw him.

2244
03:00:01,133 --> 03:00:02,786
ALL: Yeah!

2245
03:00:02,786 --> 03:00:09,074
JON: Yeah, against one of the pillars in the bar,
away from the innocent people.

2246
03:00:09,074 --> 03:00:21,132
MATT: Make an athletics check. And you have
advantage on this because you're raging, so you

2247
03:00:21,132 --> 03:00:23,481
roll twice and take the higher of the two.

2248
03:00:23,481 --> 03:00:24,662
JON: Oh, it's just the best?

2249
03:00:24,662 --> 03:00:27,213
TALIESIN: Roll again. Yeah, roll again, best of
two. Better!

2250
03:00:27,213 --> 03:00:29,193
JON: 22.

2251
03:00:29,193 --> 03:00:36,380
MATT: Okay, 22. Grog, I'm going to say, because
you're grappled, go ahead and roll an athletics

2252
03:00:36,380 --> 03:00:37,598
check with disadvantage.

2253
03:00:37,598 --> 03:00:39,564
TRAVIS: You got it.

2254
03:00:39,564 --> 03:00:42,993
MATT: It should be one roll, because you're
raging, you also

2255
03:00:42,993 --> 03:00:44,557
get advantage on it, technically.

2256
03:00:44,557 --> 03:00:46,019
TRAVIS: Just one roll? 24.

2257
03:00:46,019 --> 03:00:49,974
MATT: 24. You reach off, you leap over and you
grab him and you go to pull and it's like pulling

2258
03:00:49,974 --> 03:00:58,216
a pillar. Not budging. You can try again if you
want to, or do something else.

2259
03:00:58,216 --> 03:00:59,690
MARISHA: Oh, because he has a second...

2260
03:00:59,690 --> 03:01:00,985
MATT: He has a second attack, yeah.

2261
03:01:00,985 --> 03:01:12,416
JON: I tried to jump over, so now I'm just--
Actually, I did the flip but I didn't pull him, so

2262
03:01:12,416 --> 03:01:16,037
now I'm just hanging on the front of him. I'm
still holding on,

2263
03:01:16,037 --> 03:01:19,124
but now I'm in front of him, dangling.

2264
03:01:19,124 --> 03:01:21,009
MATT: He's stand-spooning you.

2265
03:01:21,009 --> 03:01:24,009
TRAVIS: What is this?

2266
03:01:24,009 --> 03:01:28,199
JON: Yeah, so now I--

2267
03:01:28,199 --> 03:01:29,933
SAM: Reverse pile-drive.

2268
03:01:29,933 --> 03:01:33,563
TALIESIN: Go for it! Don't think, act!

2269
03:01:33,563 --> 03:01:36,484
JON: Well, I want to start--

2270
03:01:36,484 --> 03:01:38,139
MARISHA: What would Chode do?

2271
03:01:38,139 --> 03:01:46,408
JON: Well, this is play for him, so I don't know,
this is not an attack, I just want to tickle him.

2272
03:01:46,408 --> 03:01:56,344
Kind of grinding on him. In a way, trying to use that
to his advantage to make him uncomfortable.

2273
03:01:56,344 --> 03:01:58,292
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

2274
03:01:58,292 --> 03:02:00,518
JON: That's an intimidation, okay.

2275
03:02:00,518 --> 03:02:02,313
MATT: Against Grog? Yeah.

2276
03:02:02,313 --> 03:02:08,676
JON: 27.

2277
03:02:08,676 --> 03:02:11,925
TALIESIN: Oh! Grog's ticklish!

2278
03:02:11,925 --> 03:02:15,107
MATT: Grog, make a wisdom saving throw.

2279
03:02:15,107 --> 03:02:19,541
TRAVIS: Minus two. Four.

2280
03:02:19,541 --> 03:02:24,093
JON: You guys get what I'm doing.

2281
03:02:24,093 --> 03:02:30,773
MATT: I'm going to say, for the purposes of this,
it catches you so off-guard and it's so unexpected

2282
03:02:30,773 --> 03:02:32,513
that you're stunned for the next round.

2283
03:02:32,513 --> 03:02:34,354
ALL: Oh!

2284
03:02:34,354 --> 03:02:39,374
MATT: As you do that, you see him walk up and he
starts pushing you away.

2285
03:02:39,374 --> 03:02:41,322
JON: Does he let go? I can let go now.

2286
03:02:41,322 --> 03:02:44,723
MATT: You can let go, yeah. He's like, "Uh, uh!"
You get a full other turn,

2287
03:02:44,723 --> 03:02:45,816
what are you going to do?

2288
03:02:45,816 --> 03:02:55,167
JON: Can I run back, and then do a (yelling) and
then I just dive in with the biggest punch I can.

2289
03:02:55,167 --> 03:02:58,057
MATT: Go for it. You back away, you leap--

2290
03:02:58,057 --> 03:03:01,790
JON: Yeah, everything I can put into it, all
force, because

2291
03:03:01,790 --> 03:03:03,592
I still want to get a good punch in there.

2292
03:03:03,592 --> 03:03:06,956
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and roll for an attack. If
you want it, you can make it reckless.

2293
03:03:06,956 --> 03:03:16,652
JON: Yeah, he's definitely reckless.

2294
03:03:16,652 --> 03:03:20,485
MATT: So roll twice and take the higher on each
attack.

2295
03:03:20,485 --> 03:03:24,078
JON: 15. What is that?

2296
03:03:24,078 --> 03:03:25,477
TALIESIN: That's a 20.

2297
03:03:25,477 --> 03:03:27,563
SAM: Oh, that crits!

2298
03:03:27,563 --> 03:03:30,632
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d4.

2299
03:03:30,632 --> 03:03:39,723
TALIESIN: He's also got Brutal Critical, so that
adds 2d6 to that, but we'll get to that.

2300
03:03:39,723 --> 03:03:46,694
MATT: Technically, it would add a d4, because he's
not using his sword. So, roll that twice and then

2301
03:03:46,694 --> 03:03:48,509
add your strength.

2302
03:03:48,509 --> 03:03:54,290
JON: 15.

2303
03:03:54,290 --> 03:03:57,044
SAM: But he's raging, so another three.

2304
03:03:57,044 --> 03:04:04,026
JON: 16.

2305
03:04:04,026 --> 03:04:06,585
MATT: 16 points of bludgeoning damage to you,
Grog. That's eight.

2306
03:04:06,585 --> 03:04:08,187
TRAVIS: Eight, got it.

2307
03:04:08,187 --> 03:04:12,660
LAURA: How are you doing, Grog? Are you still
okay? Are you bloodied yet?

2308
03:04:12,660 --> 03:04:14,862
SAM: He's down 22 hit points.

2309
03:04:14,862 --> 03:04:24,309
MATT: As your first attack, you run in. Right as
soon as he looks up, you're smiling as you come at

2310
03:04:24,309 --> 03:04:31,763
him. You watch as the beard shakes in opposition
of the jaw quiver and you feel and can taste the

2311
03:04:31,763 --> 03:04:35,641
iron welling up in the back of your tongue as you
may have bitten off a small piece of the back of

2312
03:04:35,641 --> 03:04:39,100
your tongue. As soon as you land from that punch,
he looks a little stunned. You have a second

2313
03:04:39,100 --> 03:04:40,451
attack if you want to.

2314
03:04:40,451 --> 03:04:49,487
JON: I'm going to do my Wave Kick. That's just
something he's always wanted to try, he doesn't

2315
03:04:49,487 --> 03:04:54,745
know if it'll work. It's where he does a
full-body--

2316
03:04:54,745 --> 03:04:56,934
and then his foot kicks him right in the groin.

2317
03:04:56,934 --> 03:05:00,404
MATT: Awesome. You've practiced this alone many
times, this is your first chance to actually use

2318
03:05:00,404 --> 03:05:03,497
it. So go ahead and make an attack for your Wave
Kick.

2319
03:05:03,497 --> 03:05:07,721
JON: Right in the crotch.

2320
03:05:07,721 --> 03:05:11,145
LIAM: Lionel, with his nunchucks, in the family
den.

2321
03:05:11,145 --> 03:05:13,211
MATT: Basically.

2322
03:05:13,211 --> 03:05:14,680
JON: So just an attack?

2323
03:05:14,680 --> 03:05:16,935
MATT: Well, it's reckless, so you roll twice, take
the higher.

2324
03:05:16,935 --> 03:05:19,158
TALIESIN: Roll again. Better.

2325
03:05:19,158 --> 03:05:20,604
JON: 17.

2326
03:05:20,604 --> 03:05:24,369
MATT: So go ahead and roll a d4 and add your
damage.

2327
03:05:24,369 --> 03:05:27,241
JON: One.

2328
03:05:27,241 --> 03:05:29,576
SAM: Plus five is six?

2329
03:05:29,576 --> 03:05:31,238
TALIESIN: No, you only roll the d4 once.

2330
03:05:31,238 --> 03:05:33,606
SAM: So one plus five plus three.

2331
03:05:33,606 --> 03:05:39,302
MATT: Okay, so nine. You take four points of
bludgeoning damage, Grog, and you just took a

2332
03:05:39,302 --> 03:05:46,343
swift Wave Kick to the groin, as he kind of
(whack). Little snap right to the nuts, so it's

2333
03:05:46,343 --> 03:05:56,448
not like an immediate pain, it's the tap. The dull
nausea pain, and he seems to shake a little from

2334
03:05:56,448 --> 03:06:02,071
the impact as he kinda grins and glares at you
with his angry eyes. Well done. Grog?

2335
03:06:02,071 --> 03:06:05,923
ASHLEY: (deadpan) Grog, stop, no, don't kill him.

2336
03:06:05,923 --> 03:06:13,921
TRAVIS: I'm so confused. I've never had another
male do that to my body. He shimmied on me. And

2337
03:06:13,921 --> 03:06:20,875
then he punched me. And then he kicked me in the
jellies.

2338
03:06:20,875 --> 03:06:23,386
I turn around and I leave.

2339
03:06:23,386 --> 03:06:25,964
(gasping)

2340
03:06:25,964 --> 03:06:29,250
MATT: He just walked away.

2341
03:06:29,250 --> 03:06:34,267
SAM: It's over?

2342
03:06:34,267 --> 03:06:39,078
JON: That was fun, you guys. That was fun.

2343
03:06:39,078 --> 03:06:41,687
TALIESIN: Pike, do you want to go deal with that?

2344
03:06:41,687 --> 03:06:44,610
JON: I was just having fun. Is he all right?

2345
03:06:44,610 --> 03:06:46,252
TALIESIN: He'll be fine.

2346
03:06:46,252 --> 03:06:50,580
MARISHA: I've never seen Grog walk away from a
fight. He's not fine. What are you talking about?

2347
03:06:50,580 --> 03:06:53,095
TALIESIN: I didn't say he's fine, I said he will
be fine.

2348
03:06:53,095 --> 03:06:57,531
SAM: I'm pretty sure this makes you a member of
Vox Machina now.

2349
03:06:57,531 --> 03:07:00,772
TALIESIN: Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

2350
03:07:00,772 --> 03:07:03,617
SAM: Well, that's what happened to me, they
attacked me and then I was in.

2351
03:07:03,617 --> 03:07:07,456
TALIESIN: There was chocolate milk on the way.

2352
03:07:07,456 --> 03:07:13,251
MATT: You see the woman in the back is carrying
this mug and is like, "Right."

2353
03:07:13,251 --> 03:07:15,513
SAM: He'll need a straw.

2354
03:07:15,513 --> 03:07:19,633
MATT: "Here's your chocolate milk."

2355
03:07:19,633 --> 03:07:25,540
JON: Anybody else want to fight?

2356
03:07:25,540 --> 03:07:27,453
ASHLEY: I punch him across the face.

2357
03:07:27,453 --> 03:07:29,047
(cheering)

2358
03:07:29,047 --> 03:07:31,446
MATT: You get the chocolate milk to your mouth,
before (impact sound)

2359
03:07:31,446 --> 03:07:34,003
knocks it right out of your hand.

2360
03:07:34,003 --> 03:07:37,104
TALIESIN: Were you standing on the table when this
happened? I'm so excited.

2361
03:07:37,104 --> 03:07:42,593
MATT: And you watch, the fist comes across, and
the gnome that is in an arc of movement lands on her

2362
03:07:42,593 --> 03:07:48,615
feet. You look down and you can see the
white-haired, fully armored gnome there with her

2363
03:07:48,615 --> 03:07:52,378
big gauntlets is now there below you, kind of
grinning and growling.

2364
03:07:52,378 --> 03:07:55,472
MARISHA: That was good chocolate milk!

2365
03:07:55,472 --> 03:07:57,066
TALIESIN: We'll have another.

2366
03:07:57,066 --> 03:08:00,694
JON: I'm bummed about the chocolate. You guys have
any more chocolate milk?

2367
03:08:00,694 --> 03:08:02,378
MATT: "Yeah."

2368
03:08:02,378 --> 03:08:03,553
TALIESIN: Another round.

2369
03:08:03,553 --> 03:08:05,309
MATT: "Okay." She wanders off.

2370
03:08:05,309 --> 03:08:07,184
MARISHA: Chocolate's expensive, here.

2371
03:08:07,184 --> 03:08:11,474
JON: That was awesome.

2372
03:08:11,474 --> 03:08:13,815
TALIESIN: She can take it.

2373
03:08:13,815 --> 03:08:21,499
ASHLEY: I'm pretty awesome. I finish my ale, flick
a money on the bar, and leave. Oh shit, I don't

2374
03:08:21,499 --> 03:08:24,222
have any money, because I gave it all away. Tary,
Tary?

2375
03:08:24,222 --> 03:08:25,606
TALIESIN: I'm covering, I'm covering.

2376
03:08:25,606 --> 03:08:27,614
SAM: Thank you, because I don't have much.

2377
03:08:27,614 --> 03:08:29,872
MATT: She goes, "And the table?"

2378
03:08:29,872 --> 03:08:34,770
TALIESIN: Sorry. There's a pile that's been
growing on the table of gold for the furniture.

2379
03:08:34,770 --> 03:08:38,735
MATT: "All right, thank you." Brings you another
round of chocolate milk.

2380
03:08:38,735 --> 03:08:42,904
JON: Is anybody going to hit me before I drink
this?

2381
03:08:42,904 --> 03:08:44,778
TALIESIN: No, I think that's done now.

2382
03:08:44,778 --> 03:08:49,848
JON: I'm not, like, I'm not checking. It's fine if
you do. Okay.

2383
03:08:49,848 --> 03:08:51,273
MARISHA: Just drink it first.

2384
03:08:51,273 --> 03:08:53,873
TALIESIN: I think it's chocolate milk time.

2385
03:08:53,873 --> 03:08:55,485
JON: Mmm.

2386
03:08:55,485 --> 03:09:00,349
TALIESIN: Maybe I drink too much. I'm not sure.
This is really nice.

2387
03:09:00,349 --> 03:09:11,478
JON: I just want to say, you guys, this is the
most fun I've had in a long time. Aes, or you guys

2388
03:09:11,478 --> 03:09:13,888
call him Scanlan?

2389
03:09:13,888 --> 03:09:16,143
TALIESIN: Aes is fine, Aes is fine.

2390
03:09:16,143 --> 03:09:25,526
JON: He's all I've known for the past year, you
know? He took me in when, you know, things weren't

2391
03:09:25,526 --> 03:09:33,510
going too well for me. And it's been great. He had
a really cool speech about family, I've never

2392
03:09:33,510 --> 03:09:37,603
heard him talk like that. It was kind of weird,
because he's always been this really tough guy,

2393
03:09:37,603 --> 03:09:44,299
but I don't know if you guys realize that I just
found out he lied to me for a year.

2394
03:09:44,299 --> 03:09:53,147
TALIESIN: No, we know. It's why we took you to a
bar. He's lied to us, too.

2395
03:09:53,147 --> 03:09:59,608
JON: Well, I know that he lied to you, and I just
found out that he lied to me, but it's okay.

2396
03:09:59,608 --> 03:10:01,416
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Yeah.

2397
03:10:01,416 --> 03:10:05,874
JON: Because I realise that he was always there,
and even though I worked for him, and, you know,

2398
03:10:05,874 --> 03:10:12,002
he told me what to do, and would bark orders, he
always had my back, and he was the only one who

2399
03:10:12,002 --> 03:10:19,727
took care of me. So I think you guys should, like,
be nice to him. Or--

2400
03:10:19,727 --> 03:10:23,175
TALIESIN: That's the trouble, he does always have
your back, until he doesn't.

2401
03:10:23,175 --> 03:10:25,169
MARISHA: The idiot has a point.

2402
03:10:25,169 --> 03:10:28,256
SAM: Well, let's not call names.

2403
03:10:28,256 --> 03:10:30,610
JON: What's an idiot?

2404
03:10:30,610 --> 03:10:32,443
MARISHA: Oh hey, Tary.

2405
03:10:32,443 --> 03:10:33,459
SAM: Yes.

2406
03:10:33,459 --> 03:10:34,603
MARISHA: You're still here.

2407
03:10:34,603 --> 03:10:35,928
SAM: Yes. I am.

2408
03:10:35,928 --> 03:10:38,108
TALIESIN: I get confused because of the cup.

2409
03:10:38,108 --> 03:10:39,141
MARISHA: I know.

2410
03:10:39,141 --> 03:10:44,500
SAM: Taryon Darrington, pleased to make your
acquaintance. Hi. I'm going to be leaving soon.

2411
03:10:44,500 --> 03:10:46,668
(laughter)

2412
03:10:46,668 --> 03:10:48,034
JON: Can I kick you in the nuts?

2413
03:10:48,034 --> 03:10:49,986
SAM: Uh, please don't. I'm very dainty.

2414
03:10:49,986 --> 03:10:51,008
JON: Okay.

2415
03:10:51,008 --> 03:10:52,142
TALIESIN: Extremely dainty.

2416
03:10:52,142 --> 03:10:54,348
JON: You guys seem like you all enjoy that kind of
stuff, it's awesome.

2417
03:10:54,348 --> 03:10:56,025
TALIESIN: Well, you've met the couple that do.

2418
03:10:56,025 --> 03:10:57,294
MARISHA: You're not wrong.

2419
03:10:57,294 --> 03:11:06,566
MARISHA: Only Scanlan can make Vox Machina
speechless. It's happened a few times tonight. Did

2420
03:11:06,566 --> 03:11:07,985
you notice that?

2421
03:11:07,985 --> 03:11:09,469
TALIESIN: Hadn't.

2422
03:11:09,469 --> 03:11:10,781
MARISHA: I did.

2423
03:11:10,781 --> 03:11:13,643
TALIESIN: I'm really angry.

2424
03:11:13,643 --> 03:11:15,948
MARISHA: What do we do?

2425
03:11:15,948 --> 03:11:18,955
TALIESIN: I want to go see that bloody orb.

2426
03:11:18,955 --> 03:11:20,207
MARISHA: Hey, Chode?

2427
03:11:20,207 --> 03:11:21,447
JON: Mm?

2428
03:11:21,447 --> 03:11:22,687
TALIESIN: Lionel.

2429
03:11:22,687 --> 03:11:24,328
MARISHA: Sorry.

2430
03:11:24,328 --> 03:11:26,341
TALIESIN: You're so good about this normally.

2431
03:11:26,341 --> 03:11:29,658
JON: It's all right. At least you guys are
remembering one of my names. I had to come up with

2432
03:11:29,658 --> 03:11:35,069
a couple-- I used to have ten, just to make it
easier for people to even call me a name.

2433
03:11:35,069 --> 03:11:37,006
TALIESIN: I have quite a few names myself.

2434
03:11:37,006 --> 03:11:40,091
MARISHA: Chard? Where did you come from before you
met Scanlan?

2435
03:11:40,091 --> 03:11:48,590
JON: Well, I lived in the desert. I woke up, I
don't remember much when I was a baby. I'm sure

2436
03:11:48,590 --> 03:11:51,130
you guys all remember when you were babies, but--

2437
03:11:51,130 --> 03:11:54,154
SAM: Nope. Usually not.

2438
03:11:54,154 --> 03:11:57,388
JON: I always thought that's how it was done.

2439
03:11:57,388 --> 03:12:01,070
SAM: Nope. Nobody does. So far, so good.

2440
03:12:01,070 --> 03:12:03,913
TALIESIN: Don't break him, please.

2441
03:12:03,913 --> 03:12:15,271
JON: But the only thing I knew, I was orphaned, I
didn't-- I never know my parents, 'cause I woke up

2442
03:12:15,271 --> 03:12:20,957
in a basket, in a small creek, and the only thing
that was there were ducks.

2443
03:12:20,957 --> 03:12:24,253
SAM: Wait, wait--

2444
03:12:24,253 --> 03:12:26,649
TALIESIN: No, no, no, don't say wait! Go on.

2445
03:12:26,649 --> 03:12:28,910
MARISHA: Just let him tell his story.

2446
03:12:28,910 --> 03:12:36,040
JON: And ever since then, ducks have been my
spirit animal, and I feel like they bring me

2447
03:12:36,040 --> 03:12:44,380
strength, and bring me-- make me smarter and they
give me courage. So I grew up in the desert. It

2448
03:12:44,380 --> 03:12:46,029
was a rough time, but--

2449
03:12:46,029 --> 03:12:47,999
TALIESIN: Were these desert ducks?

2450
03:12:47,999 --> 03:12:50,662
MARISHA: Yeah, how'd you know they were ducks?
Normally ducks don't live in the desert.

2451
03:12:50,662 --> 03:12:52,309
TALIESIN: These must have been very interesting
ducks.

2452
03:12:52,309 --> 03:12:53,469
LIAM: They were actually vultures.

2453
03:12:53,469 --> 03:12:54,888
(laughter)

2454
03:12:54,888 --> 03:12:56,113
LAURA: You're not there.

2455
03:12:56,113 --> 03:12:57,161
JON: What's a vult--

2456
03:12:57,161 --> 03:12:59,582
TALIESIN: Nothing-- said a voice that wasn't
there. Carry on.

2457
03:12:59,582 --> 03:13:00,859
MARISHA: They were ducks.

2458
03:13:00,859 --> 03:13:04,920
JON: It was a small pond in the middle of the
desert.

2459
03:13:04,920 --> 03:13:08,298
Some people called it an oasis or something.

2460
03:13:08,298 --> 03:13:09,890
TALIESIN: An oasis, yes.

2461
03:13:09,890 --> 03:13:13,971
JON: Now, you know, I never saw ducks again there,
so, I don't know,

2462
03:13:13,971 --> 03:13:16,462
but I'm confident they were real.

2463
03:13:16,462 --> 03:13:17,928
TALIESIN: Migratory, perhaps.

2464
03:13:17,928 --> 03:13:22,517
MARISHA: The ducks blessed you. And your birth and
your survival.

2465
03:13:22,517 --> 03:13:26,398
JON: Yeah, I just, uh--

2466
03:13:26,398 --> 03:13:29,601
MARISHA: He doesn't know what a vulture is!
(chuckles)

2467
03:13:29,601 --> 03:13:35,389
JON: I realised I was strong, and I could do
really, you know, awesome things with my body, so

2468
03:13:35,389 --> 03:13:43,554
I did-- that kind of helped me when growing up,
and then finally I came to the city of--

2469
03:13:43,554 --> 03:13:45,322
SAM: (whispers) Ank'harel.

2470
03:13:45,322 --> 03:13:46,927
JON: Ank'harel.

2471
03:13:46,927 --> 03:13:51,399
MARISHA: That's a continent, but-- oh wait, no,
the continent-- no, Marquet is the continent.

2472
03:13:51,399 --> 03:13:53,132
Ank'harel is the city, okay.

2473
03:13:53,132 --> 03:13:54,429
JON: Yeah, stupid.

2474
03:13:54,429 --> 03:13:58,356
(laughter)

2475
03:13:58,356 --> 03:14:00,841
MARISHA: That's fair. I've earned that.

2476
03:14:00,841 --> 03:14:06,337
JON: Ever since I got to the city, I started using
it, but people would abuse me, and my body for

2477
03:14:06,337 --> 03:14:18,464
its, like, abilities. So until one day, I met Aes.
He was kind, and he brought me into his family.

2478
03:14:18,464 --> 03:14:20,967
MARISHA: Family.

2479
03:14:20,967 --> 03:14:23,897
JON: A lot of talk of family, today.

2480
03:14:23,897 --> 03:14:25,920
MARISHA: He talked a lot of family to you?

2481
03:14:25,920 --> 03:14:27,125
SAM: And ducks.

2482
03:14:27,125 --> 03:14:33,331
MARISHA: And ducks. Did he talk much more about
his family to you?

2483
03:14:33,331 --> 03:14:41,296
JON: No, I didn't-- I didn't know he had a
daughter. I mean, there was this really, like,

2484
03:14:41,296 --> 03:14:47,377
killer babe in our group, I didn't-- where is he?
Where's Aes, you guys?

2485
03:14:47,377 --> 03:14:49,367
TALIESIN: Aes ain't here right now.

2486
03:14:49,367 --> 03:14:55,371
JON: Well, don't tell him, but... I always had a
thing for her, but now that I know it's his

2487
03:14:55,371 --> 03:14:56,677
daughter, yeesh.

2488
03:14:56,677 --> 03:14:59,383
TALIESIN: You're not the first.

2489
03:14:59,383 --> 03:15:05,642
JON: Yeah, that's good to know. So. But no, I
didn't know much about, you know, he didn't tell

2490
03:15:05,642 --> 03:15:11,313
me much, I didn't ask a lot of questions. Nobody's
ever asked me questions. You guys are great.

2491
03:15:11,313 --> 03:15:21,806
TALIESIN: Boy, that's not true. But that's good.
You're a fascinating creature, sir. Good man.

2492
03:15:21,806 --> 03:15:30,444
MARISHA: We like you. We like you, Chode. Lionel.
We like you, Lionel. Hey, Lion. C'mere, c'mere.

2493
03:15:30,444 --> 03:15:36,854
SAM: No.

2494
03:15:36,854 --> 03:15:40,141
MARISHA: Parchment-boulder-shears.
Parchment-boulder-shears! I'm going to teach you.

2495
03:15:40,141 --> 03:15:42,140
SAM: It's like rock-paper-scissors.

2496
03:15:42,140 --> 03:15:48,739
MARISHA: Okay, ready, ready, ready? Boulder,
parchment, or shears. Okay. Ready? On three.

2497
03:15:48,739 --> 03:15:50,867
JON and MARISHA: One, two, three.

2498
03:15:50,867 --> 03:15:52,115
JON: I punch her.

2499
03:15:52,115 --> 03:15:54,179
(laughter)

2500
03:15:54,179 --> 03:15:56,238
TALIESIN: Never mind, not disappointed.

2501
03:15:56,238 --> 03:16:04,370
MATT: As this transpires, we come over to you two,
having a drink. So you guys find a separate pub.

2502
03:16:04,370 --> 03:16:07,958
LAURA: I figured we just sat under the Sun Tree.

2503
03:16:07,958 --> 03:16:09,370
LIAM: Yeah, I've got a flask.

2504
03:16:09,370 --> 03:16:12,542
MATT: Okay, so you guys sit under the Sun Tree.
It's midafternoon.

2505
03:16:12,542 --> 03:16:20,488
LIAM: This is complicated. Real complicated.

2506
03:16:20,488 --> 03:16:27,719
LAURA: Yeah. I was so happy to see him.

2507
03:16:27,719 --> 03:16:32,556
LIAM: Me, too. Grog and Pike were not happy to see
him.

2508
03:16:32,596 --> 03:16:38,117
LAURA: No. We've got to find a way to get them
talking again.

2509
03:16:38,117 --> 03:16:53,207
LIAM: Yeah. Yeah. I think they will, but you're
right, it will take some massaging. You know, I

2510
03:16:53,207 --> 03:16:58,595
wasn't lying, I knew we would see him again.

2511
03:16:58,595 --> 03:17:05,477
LAURA: I know. Couldn't let him know that,
though.

2512
03:17:05,477 --> 03:17:13,673
LIAM: This has been nice. It's always nice.

2513
03:17:13,673 --> 03:17:17,811
LAURA: Mm-hm?

2514
03:17:17,811 --> 03:17:26,286
LIAM: I'm real happy in my setup these days,
but--

2515
03:17:26,286 --> 03:17:28,326
LAURA: With Keyleth?

2516
03:17:28,326 --> 03:17:36,048
LIAM: That was the implication, yeah. But I miss
you busting my balls on the regular.

2517
03:17:36,048 --> 03:17:42,583
LAURA: I know, right? Yeah. I miss it, too.

2518
03:17:42,583 --> 03:17:53,001
LIAM: I think-- we were about to head back, but
we've got to get this sorted out first.

2519
03:17:53,001 --> 03:17:54,544
LAURA: Yeah.

2520
03:17:54,544 --> 03:17:58,285
LIAM: What do you reckon's next? We're going to
Marquet, then?

2521
03:17:58,285 --> 03:18:00,752
LAURA: Yeah, probably Ank'harel.

2522
03:18:00,752 --> 03:18:03,175
LIAM: You all right?

2523
03:18:03,175 --> 03:18:04,787
LAURA: Yeah, I'm fine.

2524
03:18:04,787 --> 03:18:06,363
LIAM: You don't seem fine.

2525
03:18:06,363 --> 03:18:19,907
LAURA: No, I'm great. You know, it's interesting,
Scanlan being back. Makes me realize that, you

2526
03:18:19,907 --> 03:18:24,422
know, he's not the only one who keeps secrets.

2527
03:18:24,422 --> 03:18:26,954
LIAM: Mm-hm.

2528
03:18:26,954 --> 03:18:32,759
LAURA: And you can't blame someone for keeping
things to themselves, so I'm not mad at him

2529
03:18:32,759 --> 03:18:38,482
anymore for the things that he keeps to himself,
because everybody's

2530
03:18:38,482 --> 03:18:40,383
got their something, you know?

2531
03:18:40,383 --> 03:18:44,260
LIAM: Are you getting at something?

2532
03:18:44,260 --> 03:18:49,361
LAURA: No, I'm just saying, I understand where
he's coming from, and I am all right with it now.

2533
03:18:49,361 --> 03:18:53,406
I'm fine with it. With the secrets.

2534
03:18:53,406 --> 03:18:57,586
LIAM: I feel like I'm missing something.

2535
03:18:57,586 --> 03:18:59,863
LAURA: No, nothing at all.

2536
03:18:59,863 --> 03:19:09,157
LIAM: Well, I'm not mad at him. I hope Pike and
Grog can come around.

2537
03:19:09,157 --> 03:19:15,745
LAURA: I think they will. He's quite charming. I
think everyone will come around.

2538
03:19:15,745 --> 03:19:29,004
LIAM: I hope so. I feel like, you know.

2539
03:19:29,004 --> 03:19:35,696
LAURA: The Sun Tree? Pelor? Raven Queen?

2540
03:19:35,696 --> 03:19:36,732
LIAM: Yeah.

2541
03:19:36,732 --> 03:19:38,222
LAURA: Hey!

2542
03:19:38,222 --> 03:19:40,806
(laughter)

2543
03:19:40,806 --> 03:19:44,363
LIAM: I wonder if it's time.

2544
03:19:44,363 --> 03:19:49,708
LAURA: Time for what?

2545
03:19:49,708 --> 03:19:53,726
LIAM: Nothing, I'm drunk, never mind. Did you see
this ring I picked up?

2546
03:19:53,726 --> 03:19:56,460
LAURA: (laughs) Oh, did you buy that off a little
caravan?

2547
03:19:56,460 --> 03:19:59,274
LIAM: Yeah, while you guys were fucking about with
him.

2548
03:19:59,274 --> 03:20:00,641
LAURA: That's great!

2549
03:20:00,641 --> 03:20:01,771
LIAM: It's very handsome.

2550
03:20:01,771 --> 03:20:03,428
LAURA: It's really nice. It's really nice.

2551
03:20:03,428 --> 03:20:07,765
LIAM: Yeah. Well. I love you.

2552
03:20:07,765 --> 03:20:12,678
LAURA: I love you. Glad we're all here. I'm glad
we're all here!

2553
03:20:12,678 --> 03:20:16,558
LIAM: All of us. All of us. Do you want to go find
the rest?

2554
03:20:16,558 --> 03:20:17,713
LAURA: Yeah!

2555
03:20:17,713 --> 03:20:20,359
LIAM: Let's go find the rest.

2556
03:20:20,359 --> 03:20:23,115
MATT: Okay, all right.

2557
03:20:23,115 --> 03:20:25,963
MARISHA: Right as Vax walks in-- Fuck!

2558
03:20:25,963 --> 03:20:30,775
MATT: You guys begin walking back to the pub. You've
been hearing the commotion in the distance. You assume

2559
03:20:30,775 --> 03:20:33,552
that's it. You watch as Grog walks by in a huff.

2560
03:20:33,552 --> 03:20:34,699
LAURA: Grog?

2561
03:20:34,699 --> 03:20:36,702
LIAM: Big man?

2562
03:20:36,702 --> 03:20:39,211
TRAVIS: What?

2563
03:20:39,221 --> 03:20:42,428
LAURA: Are you all right?

2564
03:20:42,428 --> 03:20:48,049
TRAVIS: Cat. C-A-T. And I leave.

2565
03:20:48,049 --> 03:20:53,463
LAURA: You're so smart! Do we see Pike come out
after him?

2566
03:20:53,463 --> 03:20:56,452
MATT: You're still in the tavern?

2567
03:20:56,452 --> 03:20:57,665
ASHLEY: I left after him.

2568
03:20:57,665 --> 03:21:01,181
MATT: You did. So then you watch Pike come out in
a huff a little after him.

2569
03:21:01,181 --> 03:21:02,364
LAURA: Pike?

2570
03:21:02,364 --> 03:21:03,701
ASHLEY: Hey!

2571
03:21:03,701 --> 03:21:05,383
LAURA: What happened in there?

2572
03:21:05,383 --> 03:21:10,359
ASHLEY: Oh, nothing. Just hanging out. Just having
a drink.

2573
03:21:10,359 --> 03:21:16,583
I'm going to go take a nap, I'm very tired.

2574
03:21:16,583 --> 03:21:17,605
LAURA: Pike.

2575
03:21:17,605 --> 03:21:18,924
LIAM: Insight check.

2576
03:21:18,924 --> 03:21:22,238
LAURA: Well, we don't really need to roll an
insight check to

2577
03:21:22,238 --> 03:21:24,527
see this one's not doing so well.

2578
03:21:24,527 --> 03:21:26,462
LIAM: It was really low.

2579
03:21:26,462 --> 03:21:37,877
ASHLEY: I'm great! I'm all right. Just going to
sleep it off, I think.

2580
03:21:37,877 --> 03:21:39,630
LIAM: Yeah, too much to drink, probably.

2581
03:21:39,630 --> 03:21:44,432
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm feeling very drunk, so I'm going
to go to bed.

2582
03:21:44,432 --> 03:21:45,784
LIAM: Pickled Pickle.

2583
03:21:45,784 --> 03:21:50,383
ASHLEY: I'm a pickled Pickle, yeah. But I'll see
you guys tomorrow.

2584
03:21:50,383 --> 03:21:53,877
LAURA: Everything will be better in the morning.

2585
03:21:53,877 --> 03:21:56,389
ASHLEY: Sleep is the best medicine.

2586
03:21:56,389 --> 03:21:59,345
SAM: You are a cleric.

2587
03:21:59,345 --> 03:22:05,228
MATT: Pike wanders off. You guys make your way to
the tavern where the commotion's there. You walk

2588
03:22:05,228 --> 03:22:11,722
in just as you see Keyleth and Lionel in the
process and about to play an intense game of

2589
03:22:11,722 --> 03:22:17,044
Boulder-Parchment-Shears before Lionel just decks
Keyleth across the face.

2590
03:22:17,044 --> 03:22:25,500
MARISHA: Hey, guys! We're playing
Boulder-Parchment-Shears! And then I Alter Self my

2591
03:22:25,500 --> 03:22:33,418
fist into a rock elemental fist, a Keyteor fist,
and I go, see, look! Boulder!

2592
03:22:33,418 --> 03:22:36,735
And I backhand Lionel.

2593
03:22:36,735 --> 03:22:40,773
MATT: First off, you roll damage for her now.
That's going to be a d4 plus your...

2594
03:22:40,773 --> 03:22:45,784
TALIESIN: d4, you already hit. Just the d4.

2595
03:22:45,784 --> 03:22:48,887
MATT: I'll say you hit because she wasn't
expecting it.

2596
03:22:48,887 --> 03:22:55,256
SAM: Is he still raging?

2597
03:22:55,256 --> 03:22:59,190
MATT: He's still raging at this point. Why not?

2598
03:22:59,190 --> 03:23:02,839
JON: I'm still raging. How long does that last?

2599
03:23:02,839 --> 03:23:06,317
MATT: Actually, no, you'd have to be raging again
because you did do your whole duck speech.

2600
03:23:06,317 --> 03:23:08,400
JON: Six.

2601
03:23:08,400 --> 03:23:11,841
MATT: So you could rage and then attack.

2602
03:23:11,841 --> 03:23:17,533
JON: So I could rage-- yeah, okay, so, that was
just-- yeah, that was all right.

2603
03:23:17,533 --> 03:23:23,172
MATT: So you take six damage. Now, Keyleth, go ahead and
make an attack roll. With your earth elemental, I

2604
03:23:23,172 --> 03:23:25,426
believe it's a plus what, to hit?

2605
03:23:25,426 --> 03:23:31,760
MARISHA: Just with my fist? Sure, you want me to
use Earth elemental? I mean, yeah, yeah, totes.

2606
03:23:31,760 --> 03:23:34,352
MATT: Just the attack bonus.

2607
03:23:34,352 --> 03:23:38,969
MARISHA: 18.

2608
03:23:38,969 --> 03:23:47,909
MATT: 18? What's your armor class? You just hit.
Add your strength modifier to one. So what's your

2609
03:23:47,909 --> 03:23:49,249
strength modifier?

2610
03:23:49,249 --> 03:23:52,707
MARISHA: Just to one? Plus five. So, six, six
damage.

2611
03:23:52,707 --> 03:23:57,654
MATT: So, six damage, you take, whack! To the
chin. Her fist is a rock.

2612
03:23:57,654 --> 03:23:59,553
JON: And do I take half that or no?

2613
03:23:59,553 --> 03:24:01,670
MATT: If you started raging before that, then yes,
you would.

2614
03:24:01,670 --> 03:24:03,078
TALIESIN: But you weren't raging yet.

2615
03:24:03,078 --> 03:24:03,975
JON: Okay.

2616
03:24:03,975 --> 03:24:06,201
MATT: But you can use your reaction to-- Off a
Duck's Back.

2617
03:24:06,201 --> 03:24:07,654
JON: No, no, I don't want to.

2618
03:24:07,654 --> 03:24:12,475
MATT: So you take the five damage right to the
jaw. Whack! So now you got both sides of the jaw

2619
03:24:12,484 --> 03:24:14,550
ringing a little bit in pain.

2620
03:24:14,550 --> 03:24:21,959
MARISHA: This is the best game of
Boulder-Parchment-Shears!

2621
03:24:21,959 --> 03:24:26,461
JON: Who else wants to-- Is it just a two-player
game?

2622
03:24:26,461 --> 03:24:32,470
TALIESIN: I am walking away with my chocolate milk
and walking over to you guys. They're bonding.

2623
03:24:32,470 --> 03:24:37,944
JON: And as he's going, I sneak a bullet from
him.

2624
03:24:37,944 --> 03:24:40,427
TALIESIN: You can try. You can certainly try.

2625
03:24:40,427 --> 03:24:46,583
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for that. Roll
your sleight of hand. And Percival, I want you to

2626
03:24:46,583 --> 03:24:50,721
go ahead and roll a perception check.

2627
03:24:50,721 --> 03:24:54,433
TALIESIN: Perception is 19.

2628
03:24:54,433 --> 03:24:56,557
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll.

2629
03:24:56,557 --> 03:24:58,418
JON: So I have to get what?

2630
03:24:58,418 --> 03:25:02,549
TALIESIN: You're rolling with sleight of hand, so
add sleight of hand to whatever you roll.

2631
03:25:02,549 --> 03:25:05,021
JON: 13 plus 11. 24.

2632
03:25:05,021 --> 03:25:06,090
SAM: He beat it.

2633
03:25:06,090 --> 03:25:08,588
MATT: You pocket a little shot.

2634
03:25:08,588 --> 03:25:11,178
LAURA: Oh, shit, he beat my passive perception,
too!

2635
03:25:11,178 --> 03:25:14,437
MATT: Yeah. Nobody sees it. Nobody sees it.

2636
03:25:14,437 --> 03:25:16,044
TALIESIN: Well done.

2637
03:25:16,044 --> 03:25:20,609
MARISHA: Hey, guys, does anyone have any shears?

2638
03:25:20,609 --> 03:25:23,153
TALIESIN: Yes, and no.

2639
03:25:23,153 --> 03:25:24,780
MARISHA: Shears?

2640
03:25:24,780 --> 03:25:26,712
TALIESIN: I have them. You can't have them.

2641
03:25:26,712 --> 03:25:28,794
MATT: So Percival walks past and approaches them.

2642
03:25:28,794 --> 03:25:31,847
TALIESIN: They're bonding. He's a bit adorable.

2643
03:25:31,847 --> 03:25:34,196
LAURA: Seems nice.

2644
03:25:34,196 --> 03:25:35,440
LIAM: He's likable.

2645
03:25:35,440 --> 03:25:39,818
TALIESIN: I am angry, frustrated, and violent, and
so I'm going to try something new and drink

2646
03:25:39,818 --> 03:25:46,403
chocolate milk, and listen to you and do whatever
it is you think is best at this point. I don't

2647
03:25:46,403 --> 03:25:51,914
know what to do. What do we do? What do I do?

2648
03:25:51,914 --> 03:26:03,650
LAURA: I don't know what to do either, dear. I
think it's a matter of... Forgive.

2649
03:26:03,650 --> 03:26:08,782
TALIESIN: Well, I'm not there yet, but I know I'm
feeling emotional, and I know that's when I need

2650
03:26:08,782 --> 03:26:11,350
to shut up and listen to you.

2651
03:26:11,350 --> 03:26:20,454
LAURA: Well, it's going to take time, I think. I'm
surprisingly okay with it.

2652
03:26:20,454 --> 03:26:23,657
I'm just happy he's back.

2653
03:26:23,657 --> 03:26:29,534
TALIESIN: I'm less not-okay than I thought I'd be.
I'm worried about Grog.

2654
03:26:29,534 --> 03:26:32,337
LAURA: I'm very worried about him and Pike.

2655
03:26:32,337 --> 03:26:37,499
TALIESIN: I'm very worried about Pike. I don't
know what to do.

2656
03:26:37,499 --> 03:26:42,772
LIAM: Are they fist-fighting in the background?

2657
03:26:42,772 --> 03:26:49,306
MARISHA: I go, hey guys, hey guys! Shears! And I
grab onto his plate armor and I cast Heat Metal.

2658
03:26:49,306 --> 03:26:51,165
(sizzle)

2659
03:26:51,165 --> 03:26:56,618
MATT: Your armor suddenly begins to turn bright
orange and burn your skin. (sizzle)

2660
03:26:56,618 --> 03:26:59,742
JON: Oh! Okay, okay, that hurts, that hurts.

2661
03:26:59,742 --> 03:27:03,354
MATT: How much damage does that do, Marisha?

2662
03:27:03,354 --> 03:27:05,600
MARISHA: 2d8 damage.

2663
03:27:05,600 --> 03:27:11,398
TALIESIN: Oh, that's going to hurt. And you get to
re-roll that one, don't you?

2664
03:27:11,398 --> 03:27:16,213
MARISHA: Oh, I do. Elemental damage. Ooh, yeah.
Ten damage.

2665
03:27:16,213 --> 03:27:18,602
LIAM: Fuck him up, babe!

2666
03:27:18,602 --> 03:27:23,596
MATT: (sizzle) It sears into you, and you're like,
"Ooh, it burns! That's new! That's new!

2667
03:27:23,596 --> 03:27:24,572
"That's new pain!"

2668
03:27:24,572 --> 03:27:30,615
JON: I try to do a little bit of the Off a Duck's
Back.

2669
03:27:30,615 --> 03:27:37,234
MATT: Yeah, so you go ahead and you take five
damage. You shrink into your armor. You try and

2670
03:27:37,234 --> 03:27:38,856
minimize your torso.

2671
03:27:38,856 --> 03:27:41,336
LIAM: He's turtling.

2672
03:27:41,336 --> 03:27:47,574
TALIESIN: All right, one second. I'm going to
gently walk up behind them while this is happening

2673
03:27:47,574 --> 03:27:50,599
and I'm going to Vulcan neck pinch him with the
Diplomacy.

2674
03:27:50,599 --> 03:27:53,601
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.

2675
03:27:53,601 --> 03:27:58,112
TALIESIN: That's... Where is that? There it is.

2676
03:27:58,112 --> 03:28:02,127
JON: This is going to take a saving throw?

2677
03:28:02,127 --> 03:28:08,436
TALIESIN: 21 to hit.

2678
03:28:08,436 --> 03:28:11,725
JON: I have danger sense, so does that...?

2679
03:28:11,725 --> 03:28:13,735
MATT: Yeah, so what's the save on that?

2680
03:28:13,735 --> 03:28:15,490
JON: It just says I have advantage.

2681
03:28:15,490 --> 03:28:17,535
MATT: On dexterity saving throws.

2682
03:28:17,535 --> 03:28:19,656
JON: On dexterity saving throws. Is that a
dexterity?

2683
03:28:19,656 --> 03:28:21,554
MATT: What's it say on Diplomacy?

2684
03:28:21,554 --> 03:28:27,957
TALIESIN: It's a... I have to pull out the thing,
I didn't pull this together as much as I thought I

2685
03:28:27,957 --> 03:28:33,001
should've. It's a constitution saving throw.

2686
03:28:33,001 --> 03:28:35,541
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll a
constitution saving throw.

2687
03:28:35,541 --> 03:28:42,511
TALIESIN: Which is a d20. I'm going to roll the
damage really quickly. Oh wow, this is a lot of

2688
03:28:42,511 --> 03:28:46,219
damage. I apologize. 17 points of lightning
damage.

2689
03:28:46,219 --> 03:28:48,892
MATT: So you take 17 points of lightning damage.

2690
03:28:48,892 --> 03:28:56,839
TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw now.

2691
03:28:56,839 --> 03:28:58,169
JON: 20.

2692
03:28:58,236 --> 03:29:00,818
TALIESIN: He saves. That's a natural 20. Oh well,
that didn't work.

2693
03:29:00,818 --> 03:29:02,861
MATT: You feel this burst of electrical energy.

2694
03:29:02,861 --> 03:29:04,906
TALIESIN: That was supposed to knock you out, and
now it didn't.

2695
03:29:04,906 --> 03:29:11,287
JON: Yeah, and it's just like, ha, that tickled.
I'm going to go to bed, you guys. That was fun.

2696
03:29:11,287 --> 03:29:13,840
Anybody else want to? No? Okay, I'm going.

2697
03:29:13,840 --> 03:29:16,018
MATT: And Lionel just leaves.

2698
03:29:16,018 --> 03:29:19,752
TALIESIN: This thing never works properly. I
really have to work on that.

2699
03:29:19,752 --> 03:29:26,986
JON: That was a weak hit, by the way, if you were
trying to hit me. See you. Oh, wait, hold on. Are

2700
03:29:26,986 --> 03:29:28,694
you going to drink this chocolate milk?

2701
03:29:28,694 --> 03:29:30,536
TALIESIN: You can take it. You've earned it.

2702
03:29:30,536 --> 03:29:32,073
JON: I'll take it.

2703
03:29:32,073 --> 03:29:34,488
SAM: Just leaves the bar with the glass.

2704
03:29:34,488 --> 03:29:36,859
TALIESIN: Another gold coin goes on the table.

2705
03:29:36,859 --> 03:29:38,368
LIAM: I mean, would you stop it?

2706
03:29:38,368 --> 03:29:39,538
TALIESIN: No.

2707
03:29:39,538 --> 03:29:41,845
MATT: So the four of you now sit there in the
bar.

2708
03:29:41,845 --> 03:29:44,540
LAURA: Five of us, Tary is there.

2709
03:29:44,540 --> 03:29:46,680
MATT: Tary is there, that's right.

2710
03:29:46,680 --> 03:29:48,930
SAM: He really would be good for the brigade.

2711
03:29:48,930 --> 03:29:50,165
TALIESIN: I kind of like him.

2712
03:29:50,165 --> 03:29:51,245
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

2713
03:29:51,245 --> 03:29:54,252
TALIESIN: He's the sort of positive energy I think
your family's going to need around.

2714
03:29:54,252 --> 03:29:56,668
SAM: Absolutely. I like him a lot.

2715
03:29:56,668 --> 03:29:58,321
LAURA: Are you sure you can't stay?

2716
03:29:58,321 --> 03:30:01,469
SAM: I'm staying for a little while. I have to
find Doty.

2717
03:30:01,469 --> 03:30:03,671
TALIESIN: I understand.

2718
03:30:03,671 --> 03:30:10,709
SAM: I have to find Doty and get some stuff, and
then I've got to be on my way.

2719
03:30:10,709 --> 03:30:15,700
TALIESIN: By the way, what you said back there,
with your family, about me.

2720
03:30:15,700 --> 03:30:16,712
SAM: Yes?

2721
03:30:16,712 --> 03:30:18,300
TALIESIN: That was very flattering.

2722
03:30:18,300 --> 03:30:21,417
SAM: Well, I know you're taken, and, you know.

2723
03:30:21,417 --> 03:30:25,387
TALIESIN: Doesn't mean I can't be flattered. I'm
quite flattered. That was very flattering.

2724
03:30:25,387 --> 03:30:27,709
SAM: I meant it.

2725
03:30:27,709 --> 03:30:31,522
TALIESIN: And, you know, if things were different,
I would feel the same way.

2726
03:30:31,522 --> 03:30:33,430
If things were very different.

2727
03:30:33,430 --> 03:30:36,856
SAM: I get it. I get it. You're sort of making it
worse.

2728
03:30:36,856 --> 03:30:38,759
TALIESIN: You're quite a catch. You're quite a
catch.

2729
03:30:38,759 --> 03:30:41,815
LAURA: Can you stop flirting with each other?

2730
03:30:41,815 --> 03:30:52,946
TALIESIN: I thought it might be fun. All right.
I'm going to gather up our things and prop up the

2731
03:30:52,946 --> 03:30:58,918
table again and leave-- How much gold would be
appropriate for the damage and then some?

2732
03:30:58,918 --> 03:31:06,045
MATT: The table isn't that expensive, to be
honest. Between the drinks you guys had, a solid

2733
03:31:06,045 --> 03:31:07,756
seven or eight gold will handle it.

2734
03:31:07,756 --> 03:31:15,266
TALIESIN: I'm going to leave ten gold and be like,
I'm so sorry, but try never not to make it worth

2735
03:31:15,266 --> 03:31:17,483
your while and not be too horrible.

2736
03:31:17,483 --> 03:31:25,239
MATT: "It's nice to know that the de Rolos are as
lively as the rest of the people who live here."

2737
03:31:25,239 --> 03:31:29,581
TALIESIN: Thank you for running this
establishment. Have a good day.

2738
03:31:29,581 --> 03:31:31,755
MATT: "You, too, my lord. My lady."

2739
03:31:31,755 --> 03:31:37,451
TALIESIN: Let's go find the kids and see if we can
make them feel better.

2740
03:31:37,451 --> 03:31:40,408
LAURA: I think they were going to bed, but we can
try.

2741
03:31:40,408 --> 03:31:47,645
MARISHA: Keyleth throws her arm around Vax and
catches him up the whole way we walk. I really

2742
03:31:47,645 --> 03:31:52,715
think you would really like Chode. He's super
nice, and he likes drinking chocolate milk...

2743
03:31:52,715 --> 03:31:55,848
LIAM: I do, I like him already. He's instantly
likable.

2744
03:31:55,848 --> 03:32:00,052
MARISHA: We got to talk a lot. We talked about his
background...

2745
03:32:00,052 --> 03:32:01,884
LIAM: I was trying to...

2746
03:32:01,884 --> 03:32:05,545
MARISHA: Yeah, gosh. Where were you?

2747
03:32:05,545 --> 03:32:08,707
LIAM: I was trying to pitch him to Tary, but I
really like him. I want him to stay.

2748
03:32:08,707 --> 03:32:11,809
SAM: No, this is all good. I love how you've all
fallen in love with Chod over here. It took you

2749
03:32:11,809 --> 03:32:16,484
guys a full two weeks to even stomach me for a
day, but that's all right. It's fine.

2750
03:32:16,484 --> 03:32:19,979
TALIESIN: We not asking him to join, while we were
thinking about having you join.

2751
03:32:19,979 --> 03:32:22,772
SAM: No, he's great, though. We're instant love
with him.

2752
03:32:22,772 --> 03:32:24,685
TALIESIN: He's not Vox Machina material, though.

2753
03:32:24,685 --> 03:32:26,368
JON: Are you Taryon right now?

2754
03:32:26,368 --> 03:32:30,980
LIAM: Hey, you know, I feel like we were about to
make our exit,

2755
03:32:30,980 --> 03:32:33,076
but it's a little more complicated now, right?

2756
03:32:33,076 --> 03:32:36,767
MARISHA: Yeah.

2757
03:32:36,767 --> 03:32:38,448
LIAM: Might need to stay on a day or two.

2758
03:32:38,448 --> 03:32:39,955
TALIESIN: Are we doing this thing?

2759
03:32:39,955 --> 03:32:42,624
LAURA: Oh, we're definitely doing this. We're
going to Ank'harel.

2760
03:32:42,624 --> 03:32:43,912
LIAM: I think we got to.

2761
03:32:43,912 --> 03:32:51,100
MARISHA: The ziggurat's kind of a big deal, right?
I feel like that's warranted for extra Ashari

2762
03:32:51,100 --> 03:32:55,402
leave time, for diplomatic duty. Right?

2763
03:32:55,402 --> 03:32:57,076
TALIESIN: You said duty.

2764
03:32:57,076 --> 03:32:58,828
MARISHA: I did say duty.

2765
03:32:58,828 --> 03:33:01,696
TALIESIN: I know. I knew you would know. Never
change.

2766
03:33:01,696 --> 03:33:06,298
MARISHA: I'll let Dad know he's going to have to
watch the tribe for a few more weeks.

2767
03:33:06,298 --> 03:33:07,700
TALIESIN: I'll let Cass know.

2768
03:33:07,700 --> 03:33:13,798
MARISHA: But one of these days I will have to be
getting back. Very soon.

2769
03:33:13,798 --> 03:33:17,692
TALIESIN: Let's talk to Pike. Let's talk to Grog.
Let's see how they feel.

2770
03:33:17,692 --> 03:33:20,755
LAURA: Pike? Grog? Did you put your earrings back
on?

2771
03:33:20,755 --> 03:33:22,498
MATT: You hear nothing.

2772
03:33:22,498 --> 03:33:24,706
LAURA: Scanlan.

2773
03:33:24,706 --> 03:33:26,448
SAM: Yes?

2774
03:33:26,448 --> 03:33:33,393
LAURA: I think they're really depressed, dear.

2775
03:33:33,393 --> 03:33:37,237
TALIESIN: I think they're angry and sad.

2776
03:33:37,237 --> 03:33:39,540
SAM: What? Percy?

2777
03:33:39,540 --> 03:33:45,446
MARISHA: Oh, this is like a one-channel frequency.
We can all hear you.

2778
03:33:45,446 --> 03:33:47,246
TALIESIN: Oh, is this a party line?

2779
03:33:47,246 --> 03:33:49,154
MARISHA: Yeah, definitely. Yeah.

2780
03:33:49,154 --> 03:33:52,193
LAURA: I'm just letting you know their earrings
are off. They can't hear us.

2781
03:33:52,193 --> 03:33:54,136
TALIESIN: Or they're not talking.

2782
03:33:54,136 --> 03:33:56,291
SAM: What should I do?

2783
03:33:56,291 --> 03:33:58,154
LAURA: Say you're sorry.

2784
03:33:58,154 --> 03:34:00,046
SAM: But they can't hear me.

2785
03:34:00,046 --> 03:34:01,884
LAURA: Well, go fucking find them.

2786
03:34:01,884 --> 03:34:05,998
MARISHA: Something like this is better done in
person,

2787
03:34:05,998 --> 03:34:10,864
as opposed to over a communication device.

2788
03:34:10,864 --> 03:34:15,368
SAM: I shouldn't text my apology?

2789
03:34:15,368 --> 03:34:17,609
MARISHA: Nope, you should not.

2790
03:34:17,609 --> 03:34:21,555
TALIESIN: Boy, there's a life lesson. D&D
continued.

2791
03:34:21,555 --> 03:34:24,896
LIAM: Don't use the Message spell to drop heavy
shit!

2792
03:34:24,896 --> 03:34:27,792
TALIESIN: Eye contact, motherfuckers. Eye
contact.

2793
03:34:27,792 --> 03:34:31,949
JON: Right then I walk into wherever he is,
right?

2794
03:34:31,949 --> 03:34:33,489
MATT: Right, you go back to the tavern.

2795
03:34:33,489 --> 03:34:40,641
JON: And I walk in. Hey. Boss. I got you the
bullets.

2796
03:34:40,641 --> 03:34:42,238
SAM: You did?

2797
03:34:42,238 --> 03:34:43,445
JON: Yeah.

2798
03:34:43,445 --> 03:34:45,774
SAM: You are my best man!

2799
03:34:45,774 --> 03:34:48,714
TALIESIN: I did give him a bag of musket shot.
It's okay. Carry on.

2800
03:34:48,714 --> 03:34:53,766
JON: So, anyways. I'm going to go to bed now.

2801
03:34:53,766 --> 03:34:55,094
SAM: Sure, sure.

2802
03:34:55,094 --> 03:34:57,341
JON: It's nighttime, right?

2803
03:34:57,341 --> 03:35:01,314
SAM: Yeah, no, it is. But did I buy him a room, or
is he just sort of...?

2804
03:35:01,314 --> 03:35:03,086
JON: No, you don't have to buy me a room.

2805
03:35:03,086 --> 03:35:04,590
MATT: You bought out the inn.

2806
03:35:04,590 --> 03:35:07,060
JON: I'll just go sleep in the corner either way.

2807
03:35:07,060 --> 03:35:11,332
SAM: Okay. Yeah. If anyone tries to kill me, kill
them.

2808
03:35:11,332 --> 03:35:14,990
JON: Oh, yeah, I got it. I have danger sense.

2809
03:35:14,990 --> 03:35:16,296
SAM: Oh, you do?

2810
03:35:16,296 --> 03:35:21,195
JON: And the ducks will tell me if there's
anything wrong.

2811
03:35:21,195 --> 03:35:24,383
SAM: The ducks. Yes, I know this about you.

2812
03:35:24,383 --> 03:35:26,501
JON: I actually have Commune with Ducks.

2813
03:35:26,501 --> 03:35:30,447
TALIESIN: He does actually have Commune with
Ducks. It is on the page.

2814
03:35:30,447 --> 03:35:31,893
Staring at it right now.

2815
03:35:31,893 --> 03:35:34,000
JON: You know what, I'm going to use it right
now.

2816
03:35:34,000 --> 03:35:35,392
SAM: Do we have ducks near us?

2817
03:35:35,392 --> 03:35:37,249
TALIESIN: There are ducks in Whitestone!

2818
03:35:37,249 --> 03:35:39,989
MATT: In Whitestone, there's a lot more ducks in
this area than there are in Marquet.

2819
03:35:39,989 --> 03:35:44,052
TALIESIN: There are ducks. We have ponds in the
local park. There's a small pond in the cemetery.

2820
03:35:44,052 --> 03:35:47,402
JON: I forget I can do that wherever I go, and I
never get the chance.

2821
03:35:47,402 --> 03:35:49,277
SAM: What are you going to ask them?

2822
03:35:49,277 --> 03:35:53,256
JON: They can tell me up to three facts about the
land.

2823
03:35:53,256 --> 03:35:58,458
TALIESIN: Yes, what do the ducks of Whitestone
say?

2824
03:35:58,458 --> 03:36:00,238
MARISHA: What do the ducks say?

2825
03:36:00,238 --> 03:36:02,055
TALIESIN: (quacking)

2826
03:36:02,055 --> 03:36:07,029
MATT: As you take a moment and you kneel, and you
close your eyes, you envision the connection you

2827
03:36:07,029 --> 03:36:14,440
had as a child to the ducks along the pond of the
oasis, and as you open your eyes again, you see

2828
03:36:14,440 --> 03:36:20,872
there, waddling in through the doorway of the inn,
as the sun in the afternoon is going down to dusk,

2829
03:36:20,872 --> 03:36:28,319
this one duck (quacking).

2830
03:36:28,319 --> 03:36:34,262
JON: Hey, Brownie! What do you have to say about
this place?

2831
03:36:34,262 --> 03:36:36,398
MATT: What do you want to ask it?

2832
03:36:36,398 --> 03:36:38,278
JON: Oh, I have to ask.

2833
03:36:38,278 --> 03:36:47,892
SAM: All I hear is quacking, right? He's just
quacking at the duck?

2834
03:36:47,892 --> 03:36:49,936
MATT: You're just hearing quacking back and
forth.

2835
03:36:49,936 --> 03:37:01,367
JON: Do we get bad weather here? Do you get bad
storms here?

2836
03:37:01,367 --> 03:37:05,761
MATT: You hear through the duck's quacks, "It
rains quite often, actually.

2837
03:37:05,761 --> 03:37:09,180
"It's pretty cloudy. Great."

2838
03:37:09,180 --> 03:37:13,294
JON: Okay, so don't leave the hut without an
umbrella, okay?

2839
03:37:13,294 --> 03:37:14,843
SAM: Okay, thank you.

2840
03:37:14,843 --> 03:37:22,240
JON: And then, do we have to worry about-- Are
there any pyramids? Have you seen any pyramids

2841
03:37:22,240 --> 03:37:23,941
around the place?

2842
03:37:23,941 --> 03:37:26,279
MATT: The duck's head turns the other way, and it
says to you through quacks,

2843
03:37:26,279 --> 03:37:29,347
"Actually, there's one below the city."

2844
03:37:29,347 --> 03:37:32,331
TALIESIN: How do the ducks know that?

2845
03:37:32,331 --> 03:37:33,848
LAURA: They wander everywhere.

2846
03:37:33,848 --> 03:37:35,309
TALIESIN: How did they get down there?

2847
03:37:35,309 --> 03:37:36,608
MATT: The essence of nature.

2848
03:37:36,608 --> 03:37:39,096
MARISHA: The same reason why pigeons are in
Costco, okay?

2849
03:37:39,096 --> 03:37:44,454
JON: He said there's another pyramid under the
city.

2850
03:37:44,454 --> 03:37:46,323
SAM: The duck knew that?

2851
03:37:46,323 --> 03:37:47,167
JON: Yeah!

2852
03:37:47,167 --> 03:37:48,627
SAM: That is crazy.

2853
03:37:48,627 --> 03:37:51,013
JON: Should we go?

2854
03:37:51,013 --> 03:37:53,115
SAM: No, no, no.

2855
03:37:53,115 --> 03:37:58,811
JON: Okay... Is there anything you need to know,
master?

2856
03:37:58,811 --> 03:38:00,147
SAM: Yes.

2857
03:38:00,147 --> 03:38:03,445
JON: About this area. It's pretty limited.

2858
03:38:03,445 --> 03:38:05,815
SAM: Have Vox Machina been happy?

2859
03:38:05,815 --> 03:38:13,891
JON: Ducks, do you know if that group over there,
have they been happy? Have they been happy?

2860
03:38:13,891 --> 03:38:19,144
MATT: "They didn't look happy when they left the
tavern."

2861
03:38:19,144 --> 03:38:31,336
JON: I think we all knew that you kind of wasted
that last one. It's okay, we did it. See you,

2862
03:38:31,336 --> 03:38:33,036
Brownie! That was awesome!

2863
03:38:33,036 --> 03:38:34,592
MATT: (flapping wings)

2864
03:38:34,592 --> 03:38:38,994
JON: Can we go to another city sometime soon so I
can do that again?

2865
03:38:38,994 --> 03:38:49,588
SAM: Yes, we will definitely do that. Absolutely.
Yeah. You need to use that skill more often. You

2866
03:38:49,588 --> 03:38:52,589
know what the problem is, we don't have as many
ducks in Ank'harel.

2867
03:38:52,589 --> 03:38:56,543
JON: I know. And most of the time I just find out
if it's going to rain or not.

2868
03:38:56,543 --> 03:38:58,446
It's not that useful.

2869
03:38:58,446 --> 03:38:59,842
SAM: You've been great this whole trip.

2870
03:38:59,842 --> 03:39:00,744
JON: Thank you.

2871
03:39:00,744 --> 03:39:05,147
SAM: I'll tell you what. I'm going to buy some
ducks, and just keep them back in Ank'harel for

2872
03:39:05,147 --> 03:39:08,087
you. They can be your little birds.

2873
03:39:08,087 --> 03:39:12,417
JON: I go to hug him, but then I forget that
he's... Is he still enchanted?

2874
03:39:12,417 --> 03:39:13,754
SAM: No, I'm a little guy.

2875
03:39:13,754 --> 03:39:17,015
JON: I squeeze him hard. A little too hard,
probably.

2876
03:39:17,015 --> 03:39:18,487
SAM: Ow, ow.

2877
03:39:18,487 --> 03:39:23,001
JON: All right, I'm going to go sleep in the
corner.

2878
03:39:23,001 --> 03:39:24,382
SAM: Please do.

2879
03:39:24,382 --> 03:39:28,569
MATT: Sleeps in the corner. All right. Scanlan,
are you doing anything?

2880
03:39:28,569 --> 03:39:31,890
SAM: I mean, I was told to come apologize and find
them.

2881
03:39:31,890 --> 03:39:33,674
TRAVIS: I was told...

2882
03:39:33,674 --> 03:39:39,096
SAM: I'll go seek my friends out there in the
world.

2883
03:39:39,096 --> 03:39:40,648
MATT: All right. Where do you go?

2884
03:39:40,648 --> 03:39:45,130
SAM: Where am I going? Hello? It's me, Scanlan
Shorthalt.

2885
03:39:45,130 --> 03:39:46,831
LAURA: Where do you want to go?

2886
03:39:46,831 --> 03:39:49,151
SAM: I don't know, where is everybody?

2887
03:39:49,151 --> 03:39:55,395
LAURA: Well. Pike and Grog went back to their
rooms.

2888
03:39:55,395 --> 03:40:00,407
SAM: I don't want to disturb them. They're by
themselves, alone.

2889
03:40:00,407 --> 03:40:01,897
Should I go knock on their doors?

2890
03:40:01,897 --> 03:40:03,273
LAURA: It's up to you.

2891
03:40:03,273 --> 03:40:09,860
SAM: Okay. I'll go find-- Do I know where they're
staying?

2892
03:40:09,860 --> 03:40:13,748
MATT: You do. You've been to Whitestone Castle,
you know where the rooms are in the castle, it's

2893
03:40:13,748 --> 03:40:14,915
just been a while.

2894
03:40:14,915 --> 03:40:16,751
SAM: I'll go knock on Grog's door.

2895
03:40:16,751 --> 03:40:18,320
JON: Do you need me for anything?

2896
03:40:18,320 --> 03:40:19,481
SAM: No, you sleep it off.

2897
03:40:19,481 --> 03:40:20,405
JON: Are you sure?

2898
03:40:20,405 --> 03:40:22,052
SAM: Yeah, you've had too much chocolate milk.

2899
03:40:22,052 --> 03:40:25,303
JON: Yeah, I am feeling a little bloated down
there.

2900
03:40:25,303 --> 03:40:29,517
MATT: You make your way to the castle. You're let
in, because the guards still recognize you as a

2901
03:40:29,517 --> 03:40:32,376
member of Vox Machina. Which room do you go to
first?

2902
03:40:32,376 --> 03:40:33,357
SAM: Grog.

2903
03:40:33,357 --> 03:40:35,063
MATT: Grog. Are you in your room?

2904
03:40:35,063 --> 03:40:36,571
TRAVIS: Mm-hm.

2905
03:40:36,571 --> 03:40:37,908
MATT: (knocking)

2906
03:40:37,908 --> 03:40:39,544
TRAVIS: Pike?

2907
03:40:39,544 --> 03:40:58,208
SAM: It's me! Scan-man! Can I come in?

2908
03:40:58,208 --> 03:41:00,397
I Dimension Door into the room.

2909
03:41:00,397 --> 03:41:02,966
MATT: Scanlan (poof) appears in the center of your
chambers.

2910
03:41:03,022 --> 03:41:11,139
SAM: You okay? You didn't come to the door. Big
fella.

2911
03:41:11,139 --> 03:41:12,765
TRAVIS: I leave.

2912
03:41:12,765 --> 03:41:16,848
SAM: I let him go.

2913
03:41:16,848 --> 03:41:21,780
I take a shit on his bed -- no, I'm kidding.

2914
03:41:21,780 --> 03:41:26,364
MATT: Grog leaves the chamber and exits.

2915
03:41:26,364 --> 03:41:28,644
SAM: I'll walk over to Pike's room, then.

2916
03:41:28,644 --> 03:41:30,041
MATT: Okay. Pike, are you in your room?

2917
03:41:30,041 --> 03:41:31,361
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2918
03:41:31,361 --> 03:41:33,279
MATT: (knocking)

2919
03:41:33,279 --> 03:41:35,761
SAM: Hello? It's me, Scan-man.

2920
03:41:35,761 --> 03:41:40,711
ASHLEY: What do you want?

2921
03:41:40,711 --> 03:41:44,558
SAM: Just to talk and say hello.

2922
03:41:44,558 --> 03:41:47,313
ASHLEY: Oh, but we already said hello.

2923
03:41:47,313 --> 03:41:58,889
SAM: Just to apologize again.

2924
03:41:58,889 --> 03:42:05,948
ASHLEY: I'll open the door. Yes?

2925
03:42:06,108 --> 03:42:18,559
SAM: Hey, listen. I know that we haven't seen each
other in a while, and we left on weird terms. And

2926
03:42:18,559 --> 03:42:29,549
everything that's happened between us. But I want
you to know that I held no ill will towards you,

2927
03:42:29,549 --> 03:42:45,665
and I thank you for agreeing to my request, a
while ago, to look after Kaylie if I should fall.

2928
03:42:45,665 --> 03:42:53,814
And I'm glad it didn't come to that, but it's an
honor to know that

2929
03:42:53,814 --> 03:42:56,159
you would have even considered it.

2930
03:42:56,159 --> 03:43:06,500
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah.

2931
03:43:06,572 --> 03:43:13,621
I slap him across the face.

2932
03:43:13,621 --> 03:43:15,296
SAM: Sure, sure.

2933
03:43:15,296 --> 03:43:17,259
MATT: (echoing slap)

2934
03:43:17,259 --> 03:43:32,643
ASHLEY: Do you know... Do you remember what you
said, before you left? I mean, obviously you said

2935
03:43:32,643 --> 03:43:39,045
lots of things. But there was one thing in
particular that's always bothered me.

2936
03:43:39,045 --> 03:43:41,505
SAM: What?

2937
03:43:41,505 --> 03:44:01,158
ASHLEY: You said that you were kept alive by some
weird fucking magic. And that's what I do. And I

2938
03:44:01,158 --> 03:44:08,292
brought you back so you could be with your
daughter. So fuck you.

2939
03:44:08,292 --> 03:44:13,442
SAM: Well, that was a cheap shot.

2940
03:44:13,442 --> 03:44:22,444
ASHLEY: Sure. And you know what, I apologize for
putting you in my clothes, but the Scanlan that we

2941
03:44:22,444 --> 03:44:29,115
know would've thought that was funny. I'm sorry I
didn't know your mother, but I imagine you don't

2942
03:44:29,115 --> 03:44:31,041
know my mother's name.

2943
03:44:31,041 --> 03:44:47,436
SAM: I don't. Pike, I don't have anything to say
in my defense. I was wrong, about the whole thing.

2944
03:44:47,436 --> 03:44:58,446
I was not a good friend, and I was not a good
teammate. And I'll have to live with that. But I

2945
03:44:58,446 --> 03:45:15,297
can tell you this. I like who I am now, and I
didn't then. So maybe, someday, we'll meet, and

2946
03:45:15,297 --> 03:45:24,844
you'll get to know the new guy, but if it's not
meant to happen right now, that's okay, and I

2947
03:45:24,844 --> 03:45:31,336
understand. And I will go back to what I was doing
before.

2948
03:45:31,336 --> 03:45:33,929
ASHLEY: So you like who you are better without
us?

2949
03:45:33,929 --> 03:45:47,629
SAM: No. No, that's not what I meant. I meant, I
like who I am now that I know my daughter, and I

2950
03:45:47,629 --> 03:46:00,807
know that no matter what, I have someone out there
who's rooting for me. And no matter what happens,

2951
03:46:00,807 --> 03:46:25,148
I've got that. And I... Yeah. That's it. I don't
like what I've been doing the last year in terms

2952
03:46:25,148 --> 03:46:31,788
of, you know. I've been breaking the law a bit,
which I know you don't love.

2953
03:46:31,788 --> 03:46:36,523
ASHLEY: I don't care what you do.

2954
03:46:36,523 --> 03:46:47,625
SAM: But I'm doing things that I want to do for me
and my girl, and it's been rewarding and it's been

2955
03:46:47,625 --> 03:46:58,797
fun, and that's all that matters at this point.
I'm comfortable with the bastard that I've been,

2956
03:46:58,797 --> 03:47:11,730
because I know that the man I am now is different.
So I can't make everybody happy anymore, and I

2957
03:47:11,730 --> 03:47:18,509
think that was my problem before. I was trying to
make everyone happy, and that's not my goal

2958
03:47:18,509 --> 03:47:31,542
anymore. I'm sorry if I hurt you. I'm sorry how I
treated you when we first met, how I ogled you and

2959
03:47:31,542 --> 03:47:41,782
flirted with you relentlessly. That was
disrespectful. But what I'm most sorry for is that

2960
03:47:41,782 --> 03:47:49,016
you met me then, and not now. And that's all I can
say.

2961
03:47:49,016 --> 03:47:57,842
ASHLEY: Well. Perhaps we'll meet again in
different circumstances.

2962
03:47:57,842 --> 03:47:59,790
SAM: Okay.

2963
03:47:59,790 --> 03:48:01,546
ASHLEY: Okay.

2964
03:48:01,546 --> 03:48:03,131
SAM: Good night.

2965
03:48:03,131 --> 03:48:04,619
ASHLEY: Good night.

2966
03:48:04,619 --> 03:48:07,191
SAM: I'll leave.

2967
03:48:07,191 --> 03:48:09,957
MATT: Okay. You make your way back.

2968
03:48:09,957 --> 03:48:16,615
SAM: And I'll just phone Vex real quick and say,
hey, didn't work. I'm going to go back to

2969
03:48:16,615 --> 03:48:17,750
Ank'harel now.

2970
03:48:17,750 --> 03:48:19,230
LAURA: No, no, no, Scanlan.

2971
03:48:19,230 --> 03:48:21,294
SAM: Yeah, it's not working, it's not great, so,
nope.

2972
03:48:21,294 --> 03:48:22,819
LAURA: Scanlan, it takes time. Things take time.

2973
03:48:22,819 --> 03:48:23,890
SAM: I'm sure it does.

2974
03:48:23,890 --> 03:48:25,100
LAURA: Scanlan, where are you?

2975
03:48:25,100 --> 03:48:27,609
SAM: I'm outside Pike's room, weirdly.

2976
03:48:27,609 --> 03:48:32,057
LAURA: Shit. Stay there.

2977
03:48:32,057 --> 03:48:35,318
SAM: I mean, I think she can hear me talking
through the door.

2978
03:48:35,318 --> 03:48:37,619
LAURA: She can't, I don't think she's wearing the
earring. Unless she put it back in.

2979
03:48:37,619 --> 03:48:40,095
SAM: No, no, no, I'm really outside her door,
talking.

2980
03:48:40,095 --> 03:48:41,715
I'm sure she can hear me through the door.

2981
03:48:41,715 --> 03:48:43,020
LAURA: Oh, seriously? Right there?

2982
03:48:43,020 --> 03:48:44,547
SAM: Yeah. Yeah. Pike, can you hear me?

2983
03:48:44,547 --> 03:48:47,139
ASHLEY: Yes, I can hear you.

2984
03:48:47,139 --> 03:48:49,145
SAM: Yeah, she can totally hear everything.

2985
03:48:49,145 --> 03:48:51,794
TALIESIN: This is an open channel. We can all
hear.

2986
03:48:51,794 --> 03:48:53,412
MARISHA: Hi, Scanlan.

2987
03:48:53,412 --> 03:48:56,404
SAM: Oh, hi! Hi, Keyleth.

2988
03:48:56,404 --> 03:48:59,659
LIAM: Maybe you should just sleep on it before
leaving town, buddy.

2989
03:48:59,659 --> 03:49:03,755
LAURA: Well, no, we're coming with you. You're not
just leaving us again.

2990
03:49:03,755 --> 03:49:05,431
MARISHA: Again!

2991
03:49:05,431 --> 03:49:07,011
LAURA: You just got here.

2992
03:49:07,011 --> 03:49:10,362
LIAM: And some of us are happy to see you.

2993
03:49:10,362 --> 03:49:13,194
TALIESIN: We're going to go see the pyramid.

2994
03:49:13,194 --> 03:49:22,076
MARISHA: Yeah, you can go to Ank'harel, but we'll
be right behind you, I guess. We know who you are

2995
03:49:22,076 --> 03:49:25,322
now, Aes... Agus...

2996
03:49:25,322 --> 03:49:30,155
TALIESIN: Tary, are you in for one more adventure
before heading home?

2997
03:49:30,155 --> 03:49:37,801
SAM: That would be a sweet close to it. I met you
in Ank'harel, didn't I?

2998
03:49:37,801 --> 03:49:39,129
TALIESIN: Yes.

2999
03:49:39,129 --> 03:49:41,861
SAM: I'm down.

3000
03:49:41,861 --> 03:49:44,650
TALIESIN: Excellent.

3001
03:49:44,650 --> 03:49:49,543
MARISHA: To Ank'harel in the morning, then.
Because I'm trying to sleep, you motherfuckers.

3002
03:49:49,543 --> 03:49:53,657
TALIESIN: Take your earring off, put it on silent
if you ever want to fall asleep.

3003
03:49:53,657 --> 03:49:57,949
MARISHA: The clasp is rusted from when we were in
the water plane, I can't take it off.

3004
03:49:57,949 --> 03:49:59,757
TALIESIN: We take ours off, I'm taking mine off
now. Good night.

3005
03:49:59,757 --> 03:50:01,279
LAURA: Okay, okay, shut up everyone.

3006
03:50:01,279 --> 03:50:02,744
MARISHA: It's stuck there.

3007
03:50:02,744 --> 03:50:12,464
MATT: All right. You all eventually find
yourselves to rest for the evening. Scanlan, you

3008
03:50:12,464 --> 03:50:13,957
make your way back?

3009
03:50:13,957 --> 03:50:20,404
SAM: I'm going to leave the little rock thing that
Grog gave me right outside his door, and I'll get

3010
03:50:20,404 --> 03:50:26,847
Lionel up at first light, and I guess we'll set
off for Ank'harel.

3011
03:50:26,847 --> 03:50:28,191
LAURA: No!

3012
03:50:28,191 --> 03:50:31,235
MARISHA: We'll see him there.

3013
03:50:31,235 --> 03:50:35,871
MATT: Okay. That's a two-week journey for you.

3014
03:50:35,871 --> 03:50:38,597
SAM: I got no other way to get there.

3015
03:50:38,597 --> 03:50:40,439
MARISHA: You could come with us.

3016
03:50:40,439 --> 03:50:41,829
SAM: It was not offered.

3017
03:50:41,829 --> 03:50:45,200
LAURA: Yes, you were, we didn't tell you to go!
Scanlan, we said don't go!

3018
03:50:45,200 --> 03:50:48,872
SAM: Didn't you just say I will see you there?

3019
03:50:48,872 --> 03:50:50,784
LAURA: No! Fucking Keyleth said that!

3020
03:50:50,784 --> 03:50:54,133
MARISHA: I said if you run away we'll still find
you.

3021
03:50:54,133 --> 03:50:55,662
ASHLEY: We'll still be right behind you.

3022
03:50:55,662 --> 03:50:57,057
LAURA: We're not telling you to fucking go.

3023
03:50:57,057 --> 03:50:58,729
SAM: Wait, so you want to travel with me?

3024
03:50:58,729 --> 03:50:59,572
LAURA: Yes!

3025
03:50:59,572 --> 03:51:01,115
SAM: Oh, okay, well, then I'll stick around.

3026
03:51:01,115 --> 03:51:03,474
LIAM: All over the earring.

3027
03:51:03,474 --> 03:51:07,829
TALIESIN: You know, I miss this drama. This is the
drama I missed. This is great.

3028
03:51:07,829 --> 03:51:15,257
MATT: So we'll say at the next morning light, as
you all come to consciousness, you find there, spry

3029
03:51:15,257 --> 03:51:25,522
and waiting in the center of town, one Scanlan
Shorthalt and one Lionel Gayheart, ready to join

3030
03:51:25,522 --> 03:51:31,262
you on a trip back to Ank'harel. And that's where
we'll pick up next week.

3031
03:51:31,262 --> 03:51:35,233
TRAVIS: Did you want to say something?

3032
03:51:35,233 --> 03:51:36,081
ASHLEY: No.

3033
03:51:36,081 --> 03:51:41,028
MATT: Is there something you wanted to do?
Something you wanted to button it on? Let's do it

3034
03:51:41,028 --> 03:51:47,218
now. As you guys are gathering in the center of
the city, on your way to the Sun Tree, they stand

3035
03:51:47,218 --> 03:51:52,548
there in the light. You guys have your equipment
on you, you're prepared for whatever may come on

3036
03:51:52,548 --> 03:51:57,044
the other side of the world in the deserts of
Marquet, wherever this mountain may be.

3037
03:51:57,044 --> 03:52:01,219
ASHLEY: Oh, you're still here.

3038
03:52:01,219 --> 03:52:08,236
SAM: Yeah. You need me to find this thing, so I'll
lead you to it.

3039
03:52:08,236 --> 03:52:16,116
ASHLEY: I throw him a bag of cookies. So we opened
a bakery while you were gone. We have these.

3040
03:52:16,116 --> 03:52:20,382
They're called shorties. They're after you. So
hopefully you like them.

3041
03:52:20,382 --> 03:52:22,892
TALIESIN: Much like you, they're a bit
disappointing.

3042
03:52:22,892 --> 03:52:24,826
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3043
03:52:24,826 --> 03:52:30,723
SAM: I'll try-- Well, does it have any...

3044
03:52:30,723 --> 03:52:34,932
JON: Cookies! (nom)

3045
03:52:34,932 --> 03:52:38,727
MATT: And that's where we'll end the episode this
week.

3046
03:52:38,727 --> 03:52:42,455
TALIESIN: Well fucking done, man! Well fucking
done!

3047
03:52:42,455 --> 03:52:44,377
LAURA: Holy crap!

3048
03:52:44,377 --> 03:52:46,972
MATT: Thank you so much for playing with us this
week! That was so much fun!

3049
03:52:46,972 --> 03:52:48,755
MARISHA: Yay Chode!

3050
03:52:48,893 --> 03:52:50,810
SAM: Chod?

3051
03:52:50,810 --> 03:52:52,762
JON: She still can't get it right.

3052
03:52:52,762 --> 03:52:56,116
MATT: By the way, I forgot earlier to mention that
PseudoSomething won the thing in the Twitch chat.

3053
03:52:56,116 --> 03:53:00,013
Congratulations to you. Denoba will contact you if
they haven't already to get your information.

3054
03:53:00,013 --> 03:53:01,799
LAURA: What was under the blanket the whole time?

3055
03:53:01,799 --> 03:53:03,135
MATT: We'll have to wait 'til next week.

3056
03:53:03,135 --> 03:53:07,038
TALIESIN: Next week is what's under the blanket.
That or cake.

3057
03:53:07,038 --> 03:53:08,181
MATT: Possibly.

3058
03:53:08,181 --> 03:53:09,686
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

3059
03:53:09,686 --> 03:53:14,529
TALIESIN: Actually, I was about to say, because
he's not seen a proper battlemap, so maybe...

3060
03:53:14,529 --> 03:53:20,081
MATT: I'll show him once you guys leave, but yeah.
Dude, thank you so much for coming and playing

3061
03:53:20,081 --> 03:53:21,242
with us. Seriously.

3062
03:53:21,242 --> 03:53:22,327
LAURA: That was so much fun.

3063
03:53:22,327 --> 03:53:23,643
TALIESIN: That was amazing!

3064
03:53:23,643 --> 03:53:25,184
MARISHA: Lionel!

3065
03:53:25,184 --> 03:53:33,390
TALIESIN: Prepare for so much duck art. There's
just going to be... It's going to be like a 50's

3066
03:53:33,390 --> 03:53:35,395
study. It's going to be so much.

3067
03:53:35,395 --> 03:53:36,758
SAM: Ducks everywhere.

3068
03:53:36,758 --> 03:53:38,313
MATT: I love it.

3069
03:53:38,313 --> 03:53:39,699
TALIESIN: Mallard art.

3070
03:53:39,699 --> 03:53:44,424
LAURA: Oh my God, next week's our 100th episode!
How fucking weird is it

3071
03:53:44,424 --> 03:53:48,524
that we got the T-shirts released...

3072
03:53:48,524 --> 03:53:52,918
MATT: Oh, dude. The minute that you showed that
the T-shirts had shown up to everyone in the store

3073
03:53:52,918 --> 03:53:56,077
tonight, me and Sam were like...

3074
03:53:56,077 --> 03:53:59,945
MARISHA: Like, if people didn't think we had a
writer's room before, they definitely are now!

3075
03:53:59,945 --> 03:54:03,213
This feels like a marketing campaign!

3076
03:54:03,213 --> 03:54:08,440
TALIESIN: I didn't know about the shirts until we
showed up. That's just been in process.

3077
03:54:08,440 --> 03:54:12,571
LAURA: Yeah, we've just been working on this shirt
for a while. And it came out this week.

3078
03:54:12,571 --> 03:54:14,195
TRAVIS: We didn't plan that in any way.

3079
