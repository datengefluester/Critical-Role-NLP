1
00:00:00,093 --> 00:00:04,504
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:09,034
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around playing Dungeons
and Dragons and say inappropriate things before

3
00:00:09,034 --> 00:00:10,804
the camera starts.

4
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:12,330
TRAVIS: Every time!

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:19,954
MATT: Anyway, we have back in person our
illustrious rogue, Vax'ildan.

6
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:22,117
TRAVIS: Welcome back, baby!

7
00:00:22,117 --> 00:00:27,136
MATT: Happy to have you back. Let's get through
our announcements quickly so we can hop into the

8
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:32,457
game, because we have a lot to discuss. A lot of
things to see. A lot of places to go. First and

9
00:00:32,457 --> 00:00:39,123
foremost, if we can give an awesome shout-out to
our sponsor Loot Crate. Once again been awesome

10
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:43,727
to the show. Once again, they have their theme this
month. Sam, did you want to say a thing or two?

11
00:00:43,727 --> 00:00:45,237
SAM: The theme this month is Sam.

12
00:00:45,237 --> 00:00:47,162
(laughter)

13
00:00:47,162 --> 00:00:53,425
SAM: It's an odd theme. It's all shirts that I've
worn. No, the theme this month for Loot Crate is

14
00:00:53,425 --> 00:01:00,437
the anti-hero. That's part of the Loot Crate theme
and the Loot Wear theme. Not just the box, but the

15
00:01:00,437 --> 00:01:02,801
bag as well. But you know what I love?

16
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:04,659
ALL: What do you love, Sam?

17
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:10,180
SAM: I love toys. I love socks. I love shirts. I
love posters. I love collectibles. I love pins. I

18
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:21,499
love boxes. And I love deals. And you can get all
of those things in combination if you get a

19
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:26,357
subscription to Loot Crate. If you use
lootcrate.com/-- that's a forward slash--

20
00:01:26,357 --> 00:01:32,275
CriticalRole, you will be instantly shown a
showcase of all the Loot Crate offerings. And

21
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:39,943
you'll get three, not one, not two, a little less
than four, but $3 off a monthly subscription.

22
00:01:39,943 --> 00:01:44,815
LAURA: It's just the first month. It's just $3 off
the very first month.

23
00:01:44,815 --> 00:01:46,945
SAM: Well, that's not as good.

24
00:01:46,945 --> 00:01:50,655
(laughter)

25
00:01:50,655 --> 00:01:53,940
SAM: But let's be real, it's still pretty good.

26
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,503
TRAVIS: Where'd you get that great t-shirt you're
wearing?

27
00:01:56,503 --> 00:01:58,435
SAM: I am the best at advertising.

28
00:01:58,435 --> 00:02:01,338
(laughter)

29
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:04,549
TALIESIN: Why did you have those notes with you?

30
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:07,352
SAM: (clears throat) Goodbye, Loot Crate.

31
00:02:07,352 --> 00:02:10,908
(laughter)

32
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:14,526
SAM: $3 off the first month is great, though. It's
still great. It's still a good intro. It's

33
00:02:14,526 --> 00:02:18,283
essentially like getting-- I don't know, I'm
done.

34
00:02:18,283 --> 00:02:21,088
LAURA: It's $3 just for writing a word.

35
00:02:21,088 --> 00:02:23,551
LIAM: It gets you in, and when you're in, you
don't want to get out.

36
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:27,180
TRAVIS: And they got really good stuff. You got
your t-shirt from Loot Crate, Voltron.

37
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,110
SAM: Oh! I'm wearing a Loot Crate t-shirt right
now. It fits. It makes me look strong and

38
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,146
handsome.

39
00:02:31,146 --> 00:02:35,307
MATT: It's true. It's true. If that $3 can buy you
a six-inch sandwich at an undisclosed location

40
00:02:35,307 --> 00:02:37,870
where sandwiches can be constructed, purchased by
artisans.

41
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,083
TRAVIS: Yes!

42
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,323
MATT: Thank you so much, Sam.

43
00:02:41,323 --> 00:02:43,181
SAM: Sure, I did really good.

44
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:46,420
MATT: You did great, Sam. That was wonderful.
Taliesin, you're handling it next week.

45
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,661
TALIESIN: (groans) Okay.

46
00:02:49,661 --> 00:02:51,776
(laughter)

47
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:58,612
MATT: All right, next announcements. Two weeks
from now, the first Thursday of September, I

48
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:05,048
myself, Marisha, and Taliesin will be out of town.
We'll be in the middle of the desert. However, the

49
00:03:05,048 --> 00:03:12,281
rest of the crew here will be playing a one-shot
game, dungeon mastered by our wonderful, recently

50
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:15,569
proven skilled dungeon master here, Liam O'Brien.

51
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,372
LIAM: I'm all growed up.

52
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:24,718
MATT: Somehow in the canon world of Exandria. So
we'll see how that plays out for you guys. I'm

53
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:26,371
really excited to see what you pull together,
man.

54
00:03:26,371 --> 00:03:28,374
LIAM: I have something very delightful planned.

55
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:34,026
MATT: So that'll be fun. So look forward to that
in a couple of weeks. We'll be thinking of you

56
00:03:34,026 --> 00:03:39,678
guys while we're not here, but watch this guy be
evil. It's going to be great. Anything else anyone

57
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,015
wants to discuss?

58
00:03:41,015 --> 00:03:43,765
LIAM: I would like to announce that I am so
goddamn happy to be back in this room.

59
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,702
TRAVIS: Yeah! Back in the pilot chair.

60
00:03:46,702 --> 00:03:50,179
SAM: Wait a second, pilot chair?

61
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:52,792
MARISHA: Just don't think about it too much.

62
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:57,514
MATT: Can I also point out today that the official
World of Warcraft Twitter made a Critical Role joke?

63
00:03:57,514 --> 00:03:59,301
TALIESIN: Is that true?

64
00:03:59,301 --> 00:04:07,150
MATT: Someone sent them a piece of fanart that had
a Jaina and an Illidan talking, and the Critical

65
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:12,362
Role, or the response to me from World of
Warcraft, was: the Legion is coming towards you.

66
00:04:12,362 --> 00:04:24,250
How do you want to do this? That made me happy. So
let's dive in to tonight's episode of chaos and

67
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,509
heroic whim.

68
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:26,994
LIAM: What's going to happen?

69
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:31,136
MATT: Out here, we dive into tonight's episode of
Critical Role.

70
00:04:31,136 --> 00:05:57,544
[dramatic music]

71
00:05:57,619 --> 00:06:03,604
MATT: Welcome back. Last we left off, Vox Machina,
in their search for the Vestiges of Divergence to

72
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:08,944
gain artifacts powerful enough to rival,
hopefully, the power of the Chroma Conclave, a

73
00:06:08,944 --> 00:06:13,419
group of chromatic dragons that have been
terrorizing the countryside of Tal'Dorei. The

74
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:20,406
party has just finished their journey through the
Feywild, a strange, magically overgrown realm of

75
00:06:20,406 --> 00:06:34,277
fey creatures, illusion, and apparently, corrupt
tree-bros. After a fight with this long-mentally

76
00:06:34,277 --> 00:06:41,769
disturbed fey, heartbroken and driven to vengeance
and soiling the land around him, you defeated him

77
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:50,375
and took from him the bow, Fenthras, which you've
been seeking. Your Vestige, Vex.

78
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,155
LAURA: That's right. That's right.

79
00:06:52,155 --> 00:06:59,474
MATT: You then gathered hands and through the
magical capabilities of Keyleth, the druid of the

80
00:06:59,474 --> 00:07:08,364
Air Ashari, you managed to Plane Shift the rest of
the party back to Whitestone itself. Speaking of which--

81
00:07:08,364 --> 00:07:11,534
LAURA: Already? Already?

82
00:07:11,534 --> 00:07:15,262
MARISHA: How long have we been gone?

83
00:07:15,262 --> 00:07:27,212
MATT: All right, and I also need Scanlan, Percy,
and Grog to roll wisdom saving throws.

84
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:30,664
SAM: What did we do to deserve that?

85
00:07:30,664 --> 00:07:39,240
TALIESIN: We all deserve it. We know we do. That
was terrible. I have a thing called Resolve and I

86
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,445
have one usage of it left. May I use it?

87
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:43,377
MATT: You get to reroll a saving throw? Yeah, you
may.

88
00:07:43,377 --> 00:07:44,604
TALIESIN: Okay.

89
00:07:44,604 --> 00:07:47,799
SAM: Would this be magic, Matt?

90
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:49,771
TALIESIN: That's double.

91
00:07:49,771 --> 00:07:51,161
MARISHA: Goddamn it.

92
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:53,026
MATT: It's a magical effect.

93
00:07:53,026 --> 00:07:55,076
TRAVIS: We're in trouble.

94
00:07:55,076 --> 00:07:59,515
SAM: If it's not magic, then I have an 11.

95
00:07:59,515 --> 00:08:00,539
MATT: Okay.

96
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,006
LIAM: Guys, drama needs conflict.

97
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:03,290
TALIESIN: Eight.

98
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,836
TRAVIS: Six.

99
00:08:04,836 --> 00:08:06,347
LAURA: Oh my god!

100
00:08:06,347 --> 00:08:07,569
LIAM: Hot damn!

101
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:10,849
TALIESIN: I'm so excited.

102
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:18,632
MATT: No. As the portal shifts closed behind you,
you all step out into the center of the Whitestone

103
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:28,725
city square. You can see behind you the Sun Tree
where you guys left originally. It is midday.

104
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:34,253
Clouds are high in the sky. Little breaks where
you can see beams of sunlight coming through.

105
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:40,160
Looks like there's a darker rainstorm coming,
probably in the next half-day or so, off in the

106
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:48,281
distant northwest, and there are now townspeople
looking about at the group of you guys. Keyleth,

107
00:08:48,281 --> 00:08:59,397
Scanlan, Vex, and Vax: returning, your mind feels
a little fuzzy, but overall nothing seems to have

108
00:08:59,397 --> 00:09:08,165
affected you. You're glad to be back. Percy and
Grog, you are very confused how you got here and

109
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:17,050
not quite sure why nothing has happened since you
gathered here as friends. Yes?

110
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:22,620
TALIESIN: So do we have a straight piece of
missing time? Are we still waiting to go to the

111
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,064
Feywild?

112
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:29,732
MATT: As far as you guys know right now, you guys
are still waiting.

113
00:09:29,732 --> 00:09:36,810
MARISHA: That's <i>horrible</i> for Percy. You've
wanted to go your whole fucking life!

114
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,049
TRAVIS: All right, I'm ready to go!

115
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:41,927
TALIESIN: How long does this spell take?

116
00:09:41,927 --> 00:09:47,201
TRAVIS: Yeah, do we have to wait long, because I
have the pee. You know? Where you're like

117
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:48,657
hide-and-go-seek pee?

118
00:09:48,657 --> 00:09:50,215
TALIESIN: I did, but I feel fine now.

119
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,872
LAURA: Ready to go to the actual castle?

120
00:09:52,872 --> 00:09:54,549
TRAVIS: Feywild.

121
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:58,082
LIAM: Keyleth just brought us back. We're back.

122
00:09:58,082 --> 00:10:00,408
LAURA: We're back from the Feywild.

123
00:10:00,408 --> 00:10:02,777
TALIESIN: You're a terrible liar. (laughs)

124
00:10:02,777 --> 00:10:06,729
LIAM: That's true, but it's irrelevant. What the
fuck are you talking about?

125
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:08,368
TALIESIN: What are you talking about?

126
00:10:08,368 --> 00:10:11,629
MARISHA: Does the name Garmelie ring a bell?

127
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:15,880
LAURA: If he doesn't remember we went, does that
mean I lose my title?

128
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,296
LIAM: Maybe you can work it out?

129
00:10:18,296 --> 00:10:21,294
MARISHA: You titled Vex'ahlia.

130
00:10:21,294 --> 00:10:22,975
TALIESIN: I did what?

131
00:10:22,975 --> 00:10:24,395
LAURA: Oh no!

132
00:10:24,395 --> 00:10:31,277
SAM: You gave Vex'ahlia a title in your Whitestone
kingdom. She was the Duchess of some hut.

133
00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:34,745
TALIESIN: Can someone who can't successfully lie
to me please explain to me what's going on?

134
00:10:34,745 --> 00:10:37,561
LAURA: Baroness. Lady Vex'ahlia, Baroness of the
Third House of Whitestone, Grand Mistress of the

135
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:38,760
Grey Hunt.

136
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,250
TALIESIN: How do you know about the Grey Hunt?

137
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,206
LAURA: I don't know anything about the Grey Hunt,
but it's written down on a piece of paper you gave

138
00:10:43,206 --> 00:10:44,191
me, Percy.

139
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:45,542
TALIESIN: Is it written on a piece of paper?

140
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:47,095
MARISHA: It is written on a piece of paper.

141
00:10:47,095 --> 00:10:51,246
LAURA: That I actually threw out because I fixed
up my notes. So I don't have the piece of paper in

142
00:10:51,246 --> 00:10:52,833
this world binder.

143
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,181
TRAVIS: What a dicklord. You did not throw out the
paper.

144
00:10:55,181 --> 00:10:59,254
MARISHA: Someone wrote it down, right?

145
00:10:59,254 --> 00:11:04,086
TRAVIS: You piece of shit. Why did you throw it
away? What a fucking--

146
00:11:04,086 --> 00:11:10,674
TALIESIN: This is how I know you're lying, because
if I had written that down, you wouldn't have

147
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:12,592
thrown it away. That's ridiculous.

148
00:11:12,592 --> 00:11:14,926
LAURA: No, no, it's definitely right here.

149
00:11:14,926 --> 00:11:18,600
LIAM: Are you certain you're not trying to do
comedy right now?

150
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:28,285
TALIESIN: I feel funny. I don't know-- for the
sake of actual sanity, does she actually have the

151
00:11:28,285 --> 00:11:30,061
piece of paper that he wrote down?

152
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:31,184
SAM: Did he write something down?

153
00:11:31,184 --> 00:11:32,906
TALIESIN: I did, I wrote it down for her and
handed to her.

154
00:11:32,906 --> 00:11:34,426
LAURA: He did, and it's just, it's in my-- so I
don't have it.

155
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:36,860
MATT: You would've had it with you. You would've
definitely had it with you. And yeah, she does.

156
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,316
LAURA: I would still have it. It's just not in
this particular not-in-that-world binder.

157
00:11:41,316 --> 00:11:44,414
LIAM: It's not in this realm.

158
00:11:44,414 --> 00:11:47,204
SAM: The binder that Vex carries is much, much
better.

159
00:11:47,204 --> 00:11:49,770
TALIESIN: It's got like fur. And some like--

160
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,986
LAURA: Keeps it under her arm the whole time.

161
00:11:51,986 --> 00:11:53,503
LIAM: There are more worlds than these.

162
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:55,726
LAURA: It's got a happy kitten on it that says
"hang in there."

163
00:11:55,726 --> 00:11:57,759
LIAM: It says life-- (laughter)

164
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,627
LAURA: Life needs things to live?

165
00:12:01,627 --> 00:12:06,500
TALIESIN: I don't know what's so funny about that
either. I don't remember any of that.

166
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,543
LIAM: It grows on you so quickly, though.

167
00:12:08,543 --> 00:12:09,617
LAURA: Grog.

168
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:10,518
TRAVIS: What?

169
00:12:10,518 --> 00:12:13,789
MARISHA: Show him the paper, Vex.

170
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:19,297
LAURA: Oh, here. It's right here. Right here.
That's your handwriting, don't you see it?

171
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:21,041
MARISHA: We were committing.

172
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:29,167
TALIESIN: It's fine. I'm happy to commit to this.
Why? What hap--? What?

173
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:30,405
LAURA: Oh god.

174
00:12:30,405 --> 00:12:31,743
MARISHA: We were in Syngorn.

175
00:12:31,743 --> 00:12:37,895
SAM: Wait, I think I can help. I'm going to cast
Modify Memory on Percy.

176
00:12:37,895 --> 00:12:43,023
LAURA: And Grog's just content sitting over here
completely blank.

177
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:44,921
LIAM: Eating chicken that he found on the road.

178
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:50,861
TALIESIN: This is so exciting.

179
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:53,113
MARISHA: Little gamey?

180
00:12:53,113 --> 00:12:57,852
TALIESIN: I've never seen him laugh like that
before.

181
00:12:57,852 --> 00:13:03,588
MATT: This is-- this is a way to do it. All right.
All right.

182
00:13:03,588 --> 00:13:06,479
SAM: I can help you remember, Percy. Just look
into my eyes.

183
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:07,584
TALIESIN: I don't want to.

184
00:13:07,584 --> 00:13:09,122
SAM: Look into my eyes.

185
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:13,500
(laughter)

186
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,617
TALIESIN: Well, that's getting giffed. Okay,
yeah.

187
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:21,457
LAURA: But wait, are you just going to make up
what he remembers? No!

188
00:13:21,457 --> 00:13:24,498
MATT: Percy, I need you to make a wisdom saving
throw.

189
00:13:24,498 --> 00:13:27,550
TALIESIN: Oh, and I'm out of Resolve.

190
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:30,696
MATT: What is your spell DC? Is this with the
cone? Scanlan, is this with the cone?

191
00:13:30,696 --> 00:13:33,309
SAM: With the cone. I want this to work.

192
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:36,949
MARISHA: You're going to pull-- screaming in his
face.

193
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,992
TALIESIN: Wow, eight.

194
00:13:39,992 --> 00:13:41,215
MARISHA: What the fuck?

195
00:13:41,215 --> 00:13:49,949
MATT: Scanlan, how do you modify his memory?
Because at this level you can alter the memories

196
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:52,267
of an event that took up to seven days ago.

197
00:13:52,267 --> 00:13:53,650
TRAVIS: What level are you doing?

198
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,267
SAM: Level seven.

199
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:58,178
MATT: But you can only modify ten minutes of it.

200
00:13:58,178 --> 00:14:02,456
LIAM: Speaking as Liam, remember that this is a
man who gave an evil sword-- he gave crystal meth

201
00:14:02,456 --> 00:14:03,652
to Grog.

202
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:09,043
TALIESIN: The best crystal meth! The finest
crystal meth in Christendom.

203
00:14:09,043 --> 00:14:14,946
SAM: I can change any memory. Ah, what was it
called?

204
00:14:14,946 --> 00:14:16,238
TALIESIN: Ten minutes.

205
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:19,749
SAM: What was your title called? There's nothing
on this piece of paper!

206
00:14:19,749 --> 00:14:21,978
(laughter)

207
00:14:21,978 --> 00:14:26,001
TRAVIS: Inception.

208
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:35,855
LAURA: Lady Vex'ahlia. Baroness of the Third House
of Whitestone and the Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt.

209
00:14:35,855 --> 00:14:38,464
SAM: Jesus Christ. Baroness of what?

210
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:41,352
LAURA: Of the Third House of Whitestone.

211
00:14:41,352 --> 00:14:43,671
TALIESIN: And Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt.

212
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:46,019
LIAM: I have no patience for any of this shit.

213
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:51,897
SAM: Whitestone and Grand Mistress of the Grey
Hunt.

214
00:14:51,897 --> 00:14:56,393
LAURA: Of all the ten minutes to have him
remember, maybe that's not the one to focus on.

215
00:14:56,393 --> 00:14:58,758
TALIESIN: It's not remembering. He's going to be
making it up. I'm not actually going to remember

216
00:14:58,758 --> 00:15:00,027
it, he's going to lie.

217
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:04,972
LAURA: Make up something wonderful for him. He's
wanted to go there his entire life. Make something

218
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:05,848
magical.

219
00:15:05,848 --> 00:15:07,706
TALIESIN: You don't have time to have this
conversation. This is happening right now.

220
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:08,812
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

221
00:15:08,812 --> 00:15:11,322
TALIESIN: This isn't happening. Fuck with me. I'm
so excited.

222
00:15:11,322 --> 00:15:12,605
MATT: Scanlan.

223
00:15:12,605 --> 00:15:15,637
SAM: Oh my god. When did we leave? How many days
has it been?

224
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:21,499
MATT: It's been close to a week in the Feywild
total, all the nights you've rested.

225
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:24,163
SAM: I can only modify ten minutes of time.

226
00:15:24,163 --> 00:15:24,987
MATT: Correct.

227
00:15:24,987 --> 00:15:26,500
SAM: So I can't build the whole story up.

228
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,257
MATT: No, he'll remember ten minutes that you plug
in right now.

229
00:15:30,257 --> 00:15:33,367
TALIESIN: And by remember meaning whatever you
explain.

230
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:34,420
SAM: All right.

231
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:39,584
MATT: And remember, as truth, whatever ten minutes
he hands out. This spell is one of my favorite

232
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:40,655
spells in the game.

233
00:15:40,655 --> 00:15:41,579
TRAVIS: This is amazing.

234
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:52,083
SAM: All right, I don't know. I'm going to make
him remember that we landed in the Feywild

235
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:59,145
together as a group. It was a beautiful field
filled with naked nymphs and fey creatures that

236
00:15:59,145 --> 00:16:02,913
all came to him and gave him a wonderful full-body
massage.

237
00:16:02,913 --> 00:16:08,208
TALIESIN: Very uncomfortable, all right. But no,
that was tension. Okay, yes.

238
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:17,688
SAM: Vex saw him and he did not want anyone to
know about this moment that he had. So in a fit of

239
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:25,166
panic, he gave her something, anything, a title. A
title to make her keep her confidence. The title

240
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:32,502
was Lady Vex'ahlia, the Baroness of the Third
House of Whitestone and Grand Mistress of the Gray Hut.

241
00:16:32,502 --> 00:16:37,014
(laughter)

242
00:16:37,014 --> 00:16:39,581
LAURA: Oh no.

243
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:46,157
SAM: She agreed to keep his secret and he had a
wonderful time before his memory fades.

244
00:16:46,157 --> 00:16:59,627
TALIESIN: Oh my. Wait, that was-- we were-- but
there was-- you shouldn't, no! Yes! I did do this. Yes.

245
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:00,725
LAURA: You remember?

246
00:17:00,725 --> 00:17:05,010
TALIESIN: I do, and we will never discuss why
again, but yes, I did do this, and I'm so glad I

247
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:11,771
wrote it down correctly because that was very
embarrassing. I'll have this approved.

248
00:17:11,771 --> 00:17:13,596
LAURA: Approved?

249
00:17:13,596 --> 00:17:17,544
TALIESIN: Yes, well, I'm going to make sure I have
to-- of course inform-- Yes.

250
00:17:17,544 --> 00:17:20,153
TRAVIS: Who's yes?

251
00:17:20,153 --> 00:17:31,995
MATT: It seems the awkward curse of the Feywild
has set into a couple of your allies.

252
00:17:31,995 --> 00:17:40,623
TALIESIN: I, apparently, am missing an awful lot
of time. But this did happen. Yes, okay.

253
00:17:40,623 --> 00:17:44,264
LIAM: Well, Percival, look at this. Show him the
bow.

254
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:48,459
TALIESIN: Oh, that kind of bow.

255
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:49,851
TRAVIS: Whoa!

256
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:56,112
LAURA: Oh, Grog, it's really badass. You killed
the guy that was holding it. You.

257
00:17:56,112 --> 00:17:58,957
TRAVIS: Me? So it's mine?

258
00:17:58,957 --> 00:18:06,763
MARISHA: I pull out the piece of the petrified
crocodile. We killed this, too. This is all that's

259
00:18:06,763 --> 00:18:08,062
left of him.

260
00:18:08,062 --> 00:18:10,407
TRAVIS: What? Those are like amazing things.

261
00:18:10,407 --> 00:18:13,507
LAURA: Wait, is this normal? Would we have known
that this is normal for people to lose their

262
00:18:13,507 --> 00:18:15,687
memory when they come out of the fucking Feywild?

263
00:18:15,687 --> 00:18:16,768
MATT: No, you would have no idea.

264
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:21,212
LAURA: We wouldn't have learned any of that in our
studies. No?

265
00:18:21,212 --> 00:18:28,798
MATT: Your studies aren't extensive on the
Feywild, and the people that may know, partially,

266
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:32,525
are suffering from the circumstance.

267
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:36,003
TRAVIS: There's a petrified crocodile. What else
did you see while we were in this magical place?

268
00:18:36,003 --> 00:18:38,324
SAM: To be honest, my memory is foggy as well.

269
00:18:38,324 --> 00:18:42,416
MATT: No, a little bit. But you guys weren't heavy
studiers. You weren't the most studious children.

270
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,102
LAURA: (whispers) I was a studious child.

271
00:18:44,102 --> 00:18:45,231
MATT: For certain things.

272
00:18:45,231 --> 00:18:49,206
LAURA: I was a very studious child. He cheated off
my tests all the time. I was incredibly studious.

273
00:18:49,206 --> 00:18:59,675
MARISHA: Percy, I am so sorry. I know how badly
you wanted to go there. But here's the good news.

274
00:18:59,675 --> 00:19:03,781
Now that I've been there, we can go back at any
time.

275
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:08,121
TALIESIN: Really? You promise?

276
00:19:08,121 --> 00:19:11,018
LAURA: Grog, did this happen last time you went to
the Feywild?

277
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:12,641
TRAVIS: What?

278
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:14,722
LAURA: When you-- do you remember-- okay.

279
00:19:14,722 --> 00:19:19,411
LIAM: I really don't think we need to worry about
Grog so much. I think he's fine.

280
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:20,755
TRAVIS: Thank you.

281
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:25,918
LAURA: You killed so many things, Grog. You fought
so many people.

282
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:28,251
TALIESIN: Oh god! Did we get alcohol? Did someone
give us alcohol?

283
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:29,676
LAURA: No.

284
00:19:29,676 --> 00:19:30,555
TALIESIN: Damn.

285
00:19:30,555 --> 00:19:31,958
LIAM: But that can happen today.

286
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,162
TALIESIN: Yeah, but it won't be fairy alcohol, but
I know.

287
00:19:34,162 --> 00:19:36,591
MARISHA: Yeah, we've been, naturally, without
alcohol.

288
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:40,866
LAURA: We need to find Pike. Pike came to help
us.

289
00:19:40,866 --> 00:19:42,217
TALIESIN: How long have we been gone for?

290
00:19:42,217 --> 00:19:43,322
SAM: Pike was there.

291
00:19:43,322 --> 00:19:44,800
LAURA: Five days?

292
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,841
SAM: I don't know, it's a bit foggy, but a few
days.

293
00:19:46,841 --> 00:19:50,543
LIAM: Guys, let's just go find a wizard and some
alcohol, in whichever order.

294
00:19:50,543 --> 00:19:53,772
TALIESIN: I'm going to go file this and I'll meet
you in a moment.

295
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:57,338
LAURA: There's Gilmore, we could talk to him.
Allura? Maybe she can help.

296
00:19:57,338 --> 00:20:01,856
TALIESIN: Here. I'm going to make sure that that's
finalized with the correct spelling.

297
00:20:01,856 --> 00:20:13,906
LIAM: Jabba the Hutt. Not that grand to me. I
start walking off towards the castle.

298
00:20:13,906 --> 00:20:16,256
SAM: We're in Whitestone?

299
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,963
MATT: You're in Whitestone, currently, yes.

300
00:20:17,963 --> 00:20:18,951
LIAM: Come on!

301
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,129
SAM: All right, let's go.

302
00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:22,816
TRAVIS: We just left there.

303
00:20:22,816 --> 00:20:24,570
LIAM: Just eat your pigeon and come along, Grog.

304
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,773
TALIESIN: Strange. Suddenly, I am hungry. Are you
suddenly hungry?

305
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:29,736
TRAVIS: Yeah.

306
00:20:29,736 --> 00:20:32,444
TALIESIN: We should eat something.

307
00:20:32,444 --> 00:20:34,006
LAURA: I make sure Trinket's out of the necklace.

308
00:20:34,006 --> 00:20:37,262
MARISHA: Yes, I could use a glass of wine.

309
00:20:37,262 --> 00:20:39,949
TALIESIN: I could use a carafe of wine.

310
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:45,138
MATT: Trinket licks the side of your face. Nuzzles
you as you walk towards the castle.

311
00:20:45,138 --> 00:20:50,170
TRAVIS: Wait, if you got a bow, and there were
pixies, and you gave her something, did I get

312
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,178
anything? Did I pick up any diseases?

313
00:20:52,178 --> 00:20:53,859
LAURA: Lots of diseases.

314
00:20:53,859 --> 00:21:04,650
SAM: You fought bravely. And often. You wielded
your weapon strongly and proudly, and had many

315
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:12,569
definite physical encounters, and were never
frozen. And showed your power and defended us to

316
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:14,199
the best of your ability.

317
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:15,808
LIAM: You waded through blood, Grog.

318
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:18,001
TRAVIS: Can I insight check Scanlan?

319
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:21,062
MATT: (laughs) You can. Scanlan, make a deception
check.

320
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:23,836
TRAVIS: Six!

321
00:21:23,836 --> 00:21:26,932
SAM: Okay, good. 17.

322
00:21:26,932 --> 00:21:29,197
(laughter)

323
00:21:29,197 --> 00:21:30,541
TALIESIN: Holy Jesus.

324
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:35,628
MATT: Seems legit, and a part of you is
disappointed that you can't recall this memory.

325
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:39,403
But even just them speaking of it is almost half
of the fun, so.

326
00:21:39,403 --> 00:21:42,571
TRAVIS: That's pretty great. I like all those
things you said.

327
00:21:42,571 --> 00:21:44,671
SAM: You were great.

328
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:49,512
TRAVIS: Did I get any new weapons? I won't be able
to pull it out of the bag of holding unless I know

329
00:21:49,512 --> 00:21:50,608
what's in there.

330
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:51,756
SAM: That's true.

331
00:21:51,756 --> 00:21:53,857
TALIESIN: I'm going to check my pockets for
anything interesting.

332
00:21:53,857 --> 00:21:55,163
TRAVIS: I don't have pockets.

333
00:21:55,163 --> 00:21:58,047
LAURA: Percy, your sketchbook.

334
00:21:58,047 --> 00:22:00,432
TALIESIN: My sketchbook, yes, what about it?

335
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:02,503
LAURA: You made sketches the entire time.

336
00:22:02,503 --> 00:22:04,194
TALIESIN: Oh my god! I did!

337
00:22:04,194 --> 00:22:06,861
MATT: And you look through the pages and there are
sketches you don't remember drawing.

338
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:09,391
TRAVIS: Oh fuck! I mean, oh fuck!

339
00:22:09,391 --> 00:22:11,157
TALIESIN: This is so weird.

340
00:22:11,157 --> 00:22:14,061
MARISHA: You had a lovely time.

341
00:22:14,061 --> 00:22:16,917
TALIESIN: This'll do.

342
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:19,169
MARISHA: We can go back. We'll take a lovely
vacation.

343
00:22:19,169 --> 00:22:21,449
TALIESIN: No, no, this and liquor will do.

344
00:22:21,449 --> 00:22:26,934
LAURA: You used your lightning javelin. You--

345
00:22:26,934 --> 00:22:29,174
MATT: As you guys approach--

346
00:22:29,174 --> 00:22:32,502
LAURA: Yes! You have a little statue. You have a
little statue, Grog.

347
00:22:32,502 --> 00:22:37,343
SAM: Oh, that's right. A little statue of a dog
that might be magical.

348
00:22:37,343 --> 00:22:40,753
TRAVIS: A little statue of a dog.

349
00:22:40,753 --> 00:22:42,748
SAM: An onyx statue of a dog.

350
00:22:42,748 --> 00:22:46,696
TRAVIS: Can I reach into the bag of holding for an
onyx statue of a dog?

351
00:22:46,696 --> 00:22:52,508
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

352
00:22:52,508 --> 00:22:55,502
SAM: I've seen it, I can reach in there.

353
00:22:55,502 --> 00:22:58,844
MATT: One of you guys can reach in there and get
it if you want to. I just want to see if he can.

354
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:02,103
TRAVIS: 11.

355
00:23:02,103 --> 00:23:08,278
MATT: Unfortunately, your lack of imagination is
finding it difficult based on the words you were

356
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:12,498
given to formulate enough of a solid creative
thought.

357
00:23:12,498 --> 00:23:14,612
LAURA: It's black. Onyx means black.

358
00:23:14,612 --> 00:23:16,858
TALIESIN: Honest statue of a hog. It's an honest
statue of a hog.

359
00:23:16,858 --> 00:23:19,273
SAM: Doesn't know what onyx is. He's picturing--

360
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,554
MATT: He barely knows what a dog is at this
point.

361
00:23:21,554 --> 00:23:26,652
TRAVIS: If you want to reach in here and reach in
my bag. Oh.

362
00:23:26,652 --> 00:23:30,333
LIAM: Sam, you can do this to me too.

363
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:33,126
MATT: And there you have it. The onyx mastiff is
there before you.

364
00:23:33,126 --> 00:23:41,033
LAURA: It's an onyx mastiff. It's an onyx
statuette of mastiff. If you use an action to

365
00:23:41,033 --> 00:23:42,406
speak the command word--

366
00:23:42,406 --> 00:23:43,593
LIAM: Which we don't know--

367
00:23:43,593 --> 00:23:48,095
LAURA: I know. And throw the figurine to a point
on the ground within 60 feet of you it becomes a

368
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:50,309
living mastiff for up to six hours.

369
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:53,696
LIAM: I thought the guy told us we'd have to
figure it out. Did he whisper anything to you?

370
00:23:53,696 --> 00:23:57,797
LAURA: It was etched on the bottom and I totally
understand it.

371
00:23:57,797 --> 00:23:59,090
LIAM: Oh, you read Elvish?

372
00:23:59,090 --> 00:23:59,975
LAURA: I do.

373
00:23:59,975 --> 00:24:00,999
LIAM: You're partially elvish.

374
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:02,038
LAURA: It's right there.

375
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:02,977
SAM: So wait, it's insta-dog?

376
00:24:02,977 --> 00:24:03,799
LAURA: It's insta-dog.

377
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:06,164
SAM: And then what does it do? Can it fight?

378
00:24:06,164 --> 00:24:11,807
LAURA: It fights. It has sight and hearing checks.
It bites and it claws just like-- oh, no. It just bites.

379
00:24:11,807 --> 00:24:13,973
SAM: And what happens if it gets killed?

380
00:24:13,973 --> 00:24:15,340
LAURA: I'm looking, I'm looking.

381
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,107
TRAVIS: It has an intelligence of eight.

382
00:24:17,107 --> 00:24:18,705
SAM: What's your intelligence?

383
00:24:18,705 --> 00:24:19,749
TRAVIS: Six.

384
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:20,865
SAM: Oh my goodness.

385
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:24,794
LAURA: The creature reverts to its figurine form.
It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to zero

386
00:24:24,794 --> 00:24:29,058
hit points or if you use an action to speak the
command word again while touching it. When the

387
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:34,571
creature becomes a figurine again, its property
can't be used again for, ugh, seven days.

388
00:24:34,571 --> 00:24:36,951
TRAVIS: Get to the bottom part, come on.

389
00:24:36,951 --> 00:24:42,355
LAURA: Mastiff has an intelligence of eight
(laughs) and can speak Common. It's smarter than you.

390
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,831
SAM: Oh, it's a talking dog?

391
00:24:43,831 --> 00:24:44,877
LAURA: Yeah.

392
00:24:44,877 --> 00:24:46,418
MARISHA: I wonder if it has a name.

393
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:47,853
MATT: It can also see invisibility.

394
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,525
SAM: It can see invisibility?

395
00:24:49,525 --> 00:24:52,507
MATT: That's why it's a good guard dog if you--

396
00:24:52,507 --> 00:24:54,057
LAURA: And objects within that range.

397
00:24:54,057 --> 00:24:55,779
SAM: I like this dog.

398
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:57,617
LIAM: The only important thing on that paper.

399
00:24:57,617 --> 00:25:00,859
MARISHA: And how long does he last? He just lives
until he's done?

400
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:02,100
TALIESIN: Six hours.

401
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,057
LAURA: Sorry, I didn't mean to read all that and
make it not interesting.

402
00:25:05,057 --> 00:25:06,754
TRAVIS: If you set camp though, good sentry.

403
00:25:06,754 --> 00:25:09,773
SAM: But we need to know the magic word.

404
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:12,241
LAURA: We know it. It's good doggie.

405
00:25:12,241 --> 00:25:15,029
SAM: Oh, we know the word already?

406
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:17,148
MATT: It's part of the enchantment, yeah.

407
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:18,642
MARISHA: Good doggie.

408
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,948
SAM: Can you teach us how to say that in Elvish?

409
00:25:21,948 --> 00:25:23,503
TALIESIN: Don't teach him how to say it in
Elvish.

410
00:25:23,503 --> 00:25:26,303
LAURA: You can say it in Common. He understands
Common.

411
00:25:26,303 --> 00:25:27,710
TALIESIN: He understands Common, that's fair.

412
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:30,011
LIAM: Vel'ena. Vo'el'ena.

413
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:31,055
SAM: Vo'el'el'ena?

414
00:25:31,055 --> 00:25:32,202
LAURA: Yeah, that's it.

415
00:25:32,202 --> 00:25:33,692
SAM: Vo'el'la'la'la.

416
00:25:33,692 --> 00:25:35,687
TRAVIS: All right, we start walking back to
Whitestone.

417
00:25:35,687 --> 00:25:36,977
LAURA: Grog, I'm sorry.

418
00:25:36,977 --> 00:25:38,496
SAM: Let's get the dog out here.

419
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:40,131
TALIESIN: Let's hold off on the dog.

420
00:25:40,131 --> 00:25:44,201
MATT: As you guys make your way towards the
castle, there's a small group of figures. You see

421
00:25:44,201 --> 00:25:53,831
three armored Whitestone soldiers with one figure
following them. Different outfit, looks to be

422
00:25:53,831 --> 00:26:02,304
simple dark blues and grays. Dark skin, short dark
hair, carrying his crossbow at his side. As you

423
00:26:02,304 --> 00:26:04,242
make eyes, you immediately recognize this as
Jarett.

424
00:26:04,242 --> 00:26:05,338
MARISHA: Jarett!

425
00:26:05,338 --> 00:26:10,219
MATT: Jarett is coming down and he sees. "Aye,
friends, it has been a while. I'm so happy to see

426
00:26:10,219 --> 00:26:17,508
"that you survived. It's been a while. Is everyone
okay?"

427
00:26:17,508 --> 00:26:20,575
LIAM: How long?

428
00:26:20,575 --> 00:26:23,307
MATT: "Aye, most better part of a week."

429
00:26:23,307 --> 00:26:28,565
MARISHA: So it is like Saturday here, right? Time
runs the same?

430
00:26:28,565 --> 00:26:30,499
MATT: "Yes?"

431
00:26:30,499 --> 00:26:34,045
MARISHA: So it wasn't yesterday?

432
00:26:34,045 --> 00:26:35,925
SAM: Why did you taste the wind?

433
00:26:35,925 --> 00:26:37,713
MATT: "I don't know why. It's a strange
question."

434
00:26:37,713 --> 00:26:38,755
(laughter)

435
00:26:38,755 --> 00:26:40,002
TALIESIN: It tastes like Saturday, certainly.

436
00:26:40,002 --> 00:26:41,298
MATT: "More confused by the question, but it's
fine. All right."

437
00:26:41,298 --> 00:26:42,661
LAURA: How are things here?

438
00:26:42,661 --> 00:26:48,700
MATT: "Well, (sighs) let's just say better for the
time being." And as you look up, what you didn't

439
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:54,046
notice before when you saw the clouds is there's
this slight light blue hue to the entire sky.

440
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:55,561
TALIESIN: Excellent.

441
00:26:55,561 --> 00:27:02,874
MATT: There's this very faint shimmer to it. And
he goes, "Ah, the barrier is now up, which is

442
00:27:02,874 --> 00:27:10,057
"good. As soon as they finished that, Allura, Drake
and Kima all left to find information on the green dragon."

443
00:27:10,057 --> 00:27:11,366
LIAM: Where?

444
00:27:11,366 --> 00:27:15,369
MATT: "I did not inquire as to the location, but
they said they should be back in the next few days."

445
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:16,753
LAURA: Cassandra might know.

446
00:27:16,753 --> 00:27:17,644
TALIESIN: She will.

447
00:27:17,644 --> 00:27:18,766
MARISHA: When did they leave?

448
00:27:18,766 --> 00:27:24,304
MATT: "It's three days ago? They were hoping to
get insight on Thordak's current situation while

449
00:27:24,304 --> 00:27:29,218
"we amass as many armored folks here as possible
and continue to reach out for allies. I think that

450
00:27:29,218 --> 00:27:33,581
"is the main goal right now, is to find as many
allies as we can. It was interesting to put a

451
00:27:33,581 --> 00:27:35,122
"stake into this fight."

452
00:27:35,122 --> 00:27:36,848
LAURA: So you're leading an army?

453
00:27:36,848 --> 00:27:41,971
MATT: "Well, we're building whoever we can in this
vicinity. There's not many. At the very least,

454
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:43,740
"defend, in case this ends up falling."

455
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,188
LAURA: And what's your role in it?

456
00:27:45,188 --> 00:27:49,598
MATT: Welcome back. Slight little technical issue
there. We're going to roll back in. Little bit of

457
00:27:49,598 --> 00:27:55,715
information, step into the moment. As Jarett has
walked down the steps of Whitestone and began a

458
00:27:55,715 --> 00:28:01,309
conversation with Vox Machina about the current
situation here, he says how, "Currently, Allura,

459
00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:07,739
"Kima, and Drake are off trying to find information
on the green dragon, Raishan, and trying to

460
00:28:07,739 --> 00:28:14,230
"discover what best can be done regarding the
attack on Thordak in Emon. Here, I am doing the

461
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:20,845
"best I can to build what armed forces we have at
our disposal, and we're trying to reach out to

462
00:28:20,845 --> 00:28:27,644
"bring whatever allies are willing to put their
stakes into this battle. But yes, this is a

463
00:28:27,644 --> 00:28:32,402
"monumental task based on my own experience, and
I'm doing the best I can. But bear with me, it's--"

464
00:28:32,402 --> 00:28:34,192
LAURA: We have faith in you, Jarett.

465
00:28:34,192 --> 00:28:40,965
MATT: "Thank you, I'm glad somebody does. Asum
actually just arrived here. About two or three

466
00:28:40,965 --> 00:28:42,244
"hours ago."

467
00:28:42,244 --> 00:28:44,683
LAURA: Yes. We were wondering what happened to
him.

468
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:45,963
MARISHA: Haven't seen him in a while.

469
00:28:45,963 --> 00:28:51,622
MATT: "As were we. Last we heard from Gilmore that
he disappeared with Tofor within Emon after the attack."

470
00:28:51,622 --> 00:28:53,786
LIAM: Shaun's still in the city?

471
00:28:53,786 --> 00:28:59,352
MATT: "Shaun is still in the city. I believe he's
actually up meeting with Asum and Cassandra right

472
00:28:59,352 --> 00:29:00,906
"now in the castle."

473
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,789
TALIESIN: Let's clean up and head in that
direction, I'd imagine.

474
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:07,858
MATT: "Certainly. Well, if you need me, I'll be
around. Just--"

475
00:29:07,858 --> 00:29:09,060
MARISHA: Jarett?

476
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,957
MATT: "Yes?"

477
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:14,714
MARISHA: Has there been any eyes on the green
dragon here recently?

478
00:29:14,714 --> 00:29:19,063
MATT: "None of us have seen the dragon. None of us
know its whereabouts, and attempts to scry have

479
00:29:19,063 --> 00:29:21,652
"been balked. I do not know."

480
00:29:21,652 --> 00:29:24,919
MARISHA: Okay, thank you.

481
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:28,014
MATT: "It's all right. I believe there is
information on the whereabouts of the white."

482
00:29:28,014 --> 00:29:31,438
MARISHA: Do we know where?

483
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:34,402
MATT: "I do not know. That is more for what they
hold at the castle."

484
00:29:34,402 --> 00:29:35,978
MARISHA: Okay.

485
00:29:35,978 --> 00:29:38,278
MATT: "Yell loudly if you need me."

486
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:39,666
MARISHA: Thank you.

487
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:42,306
MATT: "It warms my heart to see you all safe."

488
00:29:42,306 --> 00:29:43,997
MARISHA: Same.

489
00:29:43,997 --> 00:29:48,643
MATT: He gives a little salute and a smile, and
continues with the other guards back towards the

490
00:29:48,643 --> 00:29:54,306
center of the city. As you guys ascend the steps
to Castle Whitestone, you enter the large gates

491
00:29:54,306 --> 00:29:59,902
that slowly creak open as you come to the familiar
interior. You can hear the voices echoing in the

492
00:29:59,902 --> 00:30:07,004
distance from the nearby-- what was once the guest
dining area of the castle has now been converted

493
00:30:07,004 --> 00:30:08,448
into a war room.

494
00:30:08,448 --> 00:30:13,434
As you approach the outside of the doors, they're
partially ajar; on the inside you can see your

495
00:30:13,434 --> 00:30:19,970
sister, Cassandra, sitting at a table. Gilmore is
leaned back, arms crossed, tugging on the end of

496
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:30,412
his chin goatee, and you see Seeker Asum currently
facing towards Cassandra. They're in

497
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:37,825
mid-conversation right now. As soon as you enter
the room: "It is good to know that you all

498
00:30:37,825 --> 00:30:39,496
"survive, as they've told me."

499
00:30:39,496 --> 00:30:41,679
MARISHA: Same to you, Asum.

500
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,291
MATT: As he turns and looks towards you, you can
see the side of his face that has all the heavy

501
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:54,335
tattoos now bears heavy acid scars that have
blended the tattoos into the scarring. It's not a

502
00:30:54,335 --> 00:30:59,536
very pretty sight, but he seems to at least be in
one piece right now. He still has his thick,

503
00:30:59,536 --> 00:31:04,789
hooded cloak around his shoulders, and where
normally he has a shaved head, some of the hair is

504
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:10,029
growing in in areas that can grow hair based on
the damage to this side of his face.

505
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:13,904
SAM: What happened to you?

506
00:31:13,904 --> 00:31:19,840
MATT: "What happened to me is I made out a lot
better than many of the people there that day.

507
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,667
"This-- I'll take this."

508
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:26,024
MARISHA: I'm so sorry.

509
00:31:26,024 --> 00:31:33,902
MATT: "It's fine. I've had worse. Trust me. Come,
sit." Cassandra sits up. "My brother." She comes

510
00:31:33,902 --> 00:31:36,218
up and gives you a big hug and holds you for a
second.

511
00:31:36,218 --> 00:31:40,938
LAURA: Pardon our appearance. And stench.

512
00:31:40,938 --> 00:31:42,668
TALIESIN: Yes.

513
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:43,875
TRAVIS: Do we smell?

514
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:46,323
LAURA: We're covered in that black messiness, I
assume.

515
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:48,619
TALIESIN: I hadn't even noticed, actually.

516
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:55,121
MATT: You do. And it is. Its scent has faded a
bit, but you all still are not in the most

517
00:31:55,121 --> 00:32:01,238
presentable means. However, the conversation's
dire tone seems to be enough where no one pays

518
00:32:01,238 --> 00:32:02,614
much mind to it.

519
00:32:02,614 --> 00:32:06,764
TALIESIN: We were successful. I will let the
others fill you in with some details, although I

520
00:32:06,764 --> 00:32:14,289
do-- and I'm going to double check, and I'm going
to find the brief letter explaining what I've set

521
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:22,224
up with Vex, although it will not have any of the
reason why, but it will have at least the nature

522
00:32:22,224 --> 00:32:30,778
of what's been done. And we have acquired, well,
Vex. Vex'ahlia, if you would.

523
00:32:30,778 --> 00:32:32,608
LAURA: Another Vestige.

524
00:32:32,608 --> 00:32:38,891
MATT: As you pull it out, they all step back.
Gilmore leans forward. "Very good."

525
00:32:38,891 --> 00:32:41,603
LAURA: I would love for you to take a look at it,
Shaun.

526
00:32:41,603 --> 00:32:46,764
MATT: "I would love to have a look at it." He
takes it. As you hand it to him, it actually curls

527
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:54,630
around the back of his hands and whips back into a
strong, tensile stance, and he-- "That's weird."

528
00:32:54,630 --> 00:33:02,256
He takes it and starts looking over it as
Cassandra looks back. "I'm glad you're all safe,

529
00:33:02,256 --> 00:33:09,720
"and apparently named. Welcome to Whitestone, Lady
Vex'ahlia."

530
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,702
LAURA: Thank you.

531
00:33:11,702 --> 00:33:16,537
MATT: She takes it, folds it. "I'll have this put
in the books immediately."

532
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:19,591
TALIESIN: I appreciate your kind generosity.

533
00:33:19,591 --> 00:33:23,988
MATT: "I will request more information soon."

534
00:33:23,988 --> 00:33:27,331
TALIESIN: We'll see, yes. That might be
complicated, but yes.

535
00:33:27,331 --> 00:33:37,425
MATT: "Anyway, have a seat. Asum, please, inform
them of what you've been telling us." As you all

536
00:33:37,425 --> 00:33:42,107
find a seat, he sits there quietly, his eyes
darting around in his head, ruminating over the

537
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:49,529
thoughts and trying to formulate his presentation.
He crosses his fingers in front of his face.

538
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:58,927
"Things are a bit of a mess within the city. None
are allowed to leave. Living under the watch of

539
00:33:58,927 --> 00:34:07,170
"the wyvern guard, hundreds of lizardmen worshipers
of Thordak have been watching the city from above. Some

540
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:12,148
"have tried to flee beyond the walls, but
ultimately end up being returned at the end of a

541
00:34:12,148 --> 00:34:19,813
"set of talons and not seen again. Thordak calls a
gathering every dusk of the surviving populace.

542
00:34:19,813 --> 00:34:27,753
"Tens of thousands forced to come and gather at the
center of the remnants of the Cloudtop District.

543
00:34:27,753 --> 00:34:37,156
"He gloats, instills fear in all that behold this,
and offers forgiveness to those who offer fealty

544
00:34:37,156 --> 00:34:46,819
"to him. All are to cheer his name, applaud his
statements, and thank him for his mercy. Those

545
00:34:46,819 --> 00:34:52,570
"that fail to do so are pulled from the crowd by
his lizardmen and devoured by the beast himself,

546
00:34:52,570 --> 00:35:02,257
"lined up to the slaughter as a show. And there is
laughter from the beast that pushed them into his

547
00:35:02,257 --> 00:35:10,552
"maw. Most of the wealth of the city is now amassed
in the ashes of the district, forming a massive

548
00:35:10,552 --> 00:35:18,437
"wall of shiny chunk and coin, like a nest around
the fucking beast. He's enslaved a number of the

"greatest sculptors of the city to begin making his
likeness in the surrounding stone. They chisel

550

showing his terrible face where it does not

551
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:43,784
"belong. A vain fucker. He's crazy, that one.
What's more dangerous than an intelligent dragon

552

"than one who's crazy? I've been keeping an eye as
best as I can. Thordak gives direct orders to his

presume, with the other members of the Conclave; I

554

"know not. I've been stuck within the city. Most
survivors stay indoors. I've been working with the

"Clasp, believe it or not, to shepherd over a
thousand people below the city streets for

556

"protection. The lesser of two evils, to be sure,
but at the very least, at the moment they have

557
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:23,117
"nothing to gain by working against us at this
juncture. Naught but six hours ago, the Cinder King

558
00:36:23,117 --> 00:36:30,208
"was roaring in anger, his cries echoing through
the streets. The people fell to their knees,

volcanic throne, and sent the majority of his army

"eastward. I used this distraction to slip into the
now-unguarded Lyceum, find a port scroll and a

"sigil for Whitestone before they returned. Came
here to see all of you alive, so that's the best

"news I've had in weeks. That's the best I have to
bring you about the current state of the city."

563
00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:07,208
MARISHA: That's our home.

564
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:10,758
MATT: "That's our home."

565
00:37:10,758 --> 00:37:15,158
TALIESIN: What is eastward?

566
00:37:15,158 --> 00:37:23,094
MATT: "Kymal. Westruun. Technically, here."

567
00:37:23,094 --> 00:37:25,904
LAURA: Did you bring any other survivors with
you?

568
00:37:25,904 --> 00:37:31,716
MATT: "I was the only one who could make it into
the Lyceum unseen. Tofor is still back there,

569
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:36,456
"fighting the good fight. She's working with Shenn.
They're trying to get as many below ground as

570
00:37:36,456 --> 00:37:38,307
"possible, and out of harm's way."

571
00:37:38,307 --> 00:37:40,612
LIAM: And Greyskull Keep?

572
00:37:40,612 --> 00:37:43,159
MATT: "I haven't seen it. I've been within the
city walls."

573
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:50,383
LAURA: Did you say Thordak's wife? Did I mishear
you?

574
00:37:50,383 --> 00:37:51,953
SAM: Wyvern guard.

575
00:37:51,953 --> 00:37:53,761
MARISHA: Wyvern. I heard wife.

576
00:37:53,761 --> 00:37:56,829
LAURA: Wife and guards is what I heard, and I was
so fucking confused.

577
00:37:56,829 --> 00:37:58,972
MATT: Sorry.

578
00:37:58,972 --> 00:38:01,382
MARISHA: Wait, his wyvern guard is often...?

579
00:38:01,382 --> 00:38:05,616
MATT: He sent a majority.

580
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:09,571
MARISHA: Oh, that's still me manufacturing shit.
Okay.

581
00:38:09,571 --> 00:38:14,362
TALIESIN: We don't know where they've been sent.
We don't know why.

582
00:38:14,362 --> 00:38:15,760
SAM: Eastward.

583
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,034
MATT: "That's all I've seen."

584
00:38:17,034 --> 00:38:18,617
TALIESIN: We need to find out where they're
going.

585
00:38:18,617 --> 00:38:21,459
MATT: "I had to use that time to get to the
Lyceum. Usually it's too heavily guarded."

586
00:38:21,459 --> 00:38:24,317
TALIESIN: No, of course. Just making a list.

587
00:38:24,317 --> 00:38:25,503
LAURA: You've done so much.

588
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:31,549
MATT: "I've done so little. There's more to be
done. But the more time that passes, whatever it

589
00:38:31,549 --> 00:38:34,580
"is they're planning, I'm sure is getting closer to
fruition."

590
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:38,413
MARISHA: Do we have any known whereabouts on the
white or the green dragon?

591
00:38:38,413 --> 00:38:46,476
MATT: He looks over and Gilmore steps forward,
sets the bow down, and says, "First and foremost,

592
00:38:46,476 --> 00:38:52,096
"this is a glorious piece. I could only hope to
eventually create something of its majesty." He

593
00:38:52,096 --> 00:39:01,266
hands it over. "A bit creepy in ways, but I think
you'll make good use of it. Once we complete the

594
00:39:01,266 --> 00:39:07,062
"barrier and put quite a bit of concentration each
day into maintaining it, of which Pike has been of

595
00:39:07,062 --> 00:39:11,086
"great aid to me, between the arcane and divine
magics, I think we found a fine balance.

596
00:39:11,086 --> 00:39:20,593
"Hopefully. But anyway, I've been putting the rest
of my energies towards trying to procure this

597
00:39:20,593 --> 00:39:28,782
"information. The green, Raishan, as I believe
you've told me, eludes my watch, my gaze. There is

598
00:39:28,782 --> 00:39:37,313
"a lot of protection around that one. I get the
sense that of those in the Conclave, she is

599
00:39:37,313 --> 00:39:39,524
"probably the most trained in my arts."

600
00:39:39,524 --> 00:39:42,811
LAURA: She's the one that released Thordak, so
that wouldn't surprise me.

601
00:39:42,811 --> 00:39:44,694
MARISHA: She's on my shit list.

602
00:39:44,694 --> 00:39:52,984
MATT: "I think she's on a lot of people's shit
lists. Mine as well. The white, however. I know

603
00:39:52,984 --> 00:40:01,629
"not its name, but I was able to look towards it. I
was able to find it sitting amongst a large pile

604
00:40:01,629 --> 00:40:10,346
"of rock and rubble. Looks like a fallen city,
crumbled and destroyed. From what I saw, there

605
00:40:10,346 --> 00:40:22,521
"were smoldering ruins, toppled landscapes of
buildings and temples, arcane crystals crashed and

606
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:29,833
"cracked, deep inside a ravine. There, the white
dragon perched, setting up this slow-rolling

607
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:33,533
"winter amongst a shivering horde of dragonborn."

608
00:40:33,533 --> 00:40:35,884
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

609
00:40:35,884 --> 00:40:37,572
MARISHA: What did he just say? What?

610
00:40:37,572 --> 00:40:40,407
LIAM: Shivering horde of dragonborn.

611
00:40:40,407 --> 00:40:42,486
TRAVIS: Amongst a horde of dragonborn.

612
00:40:42,486 --> 00:40:44,324
LAURA: Draconia?

613
00:40:44,324 --> 00:40:45,982
MATT: "What remains of it."

614
00:40:45,982 --> 00:40:49,823
LIAM: Fuck.

615
00:40:49,823 --> 00:40:52,562
MATT: "That was days ago."

616
00:40:52,562 --> 00:40:54,749
TALIESIN: That's a card we no longer have.

617
00:40:54,749 --> 00:40:57,528
MATT: "I need to be careful when doing this."

618
00:40:57,528 --> 00:41:01,400
LIAM: The city was razed?

619
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,590
MATT: "From what I could see, yes."

620
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,384
TRAVIS: Did you see any motion? Any slaves?

621
00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:14,291
MATT: "Oh, yes. There were many survivors, but
they were not in the best of states."

622
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:22,623
TRAVIS: This white dragon, does he bring weather,
or any sort of change? It's all ice and snow, yeah?

623
00:41:22,623 --> 00:41:28,728
MATT: "The very essence of each ancient wyrm, if
you will, carries with it its own element. It

624
00:41:28,728 --> 00:41:35,205
"slowly transforms the landscape around where it
takes up its new den. If it seems to sit atop the

625
00:41:35,205 --> 00:41:42,477
"remains of the once-proud Draconia, then it now
falls under the icy grasp of the beast."

626
00:41:42,477 --> 00:41:45,780
LIAM: And the will of the people there?

627
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:49,530
MATT: "I could not look that deep. My apologies."

628
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:55,035
MARISHA: Is this just with a simple Scrying spell?
Okay.

629
00:41:55,035 --> 00:41:57,931
TALIESIN: We must be careful. We cannot let
Whitestone be discovered.

630
00:41:57,931 --> 00:42:02,891
MARISHA: Yes, and as we've learned before, Scrying
can alert your position.

631
00:42:02,891 --> 00:42:07,531
MATT: At this point in time, you guys hear heavy
footsteps heading up from the lower floor of the

632
00:42:07,531 --> 00:42:15,273
castle. You hear two voices shout out, "Lady
Cassandra! Lady Cassandra!" They enter the room

633
00:42:15,273 --> 00:42:18,957
real fast. You see one man, probably in his
mid-20s or so, sweat pouring down his face, his

634
00:42:18,957 --> 00:42:25,379
eyes wide. "My lady." At that point you hear,
echoing outside of the castle, this loud,

635
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:27,494
piercing, shrieking roar.

636
00:42:27,494 --> 00:42:29,833
MARISHA: Oh my god.

637
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:32,291
MATT: (roar)

638
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:33,739
LAURA: Shit balls motherfucker.

639
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:38,395
MATT: It's distant, but even at that distance, it
is loud.

640
00:42:38,395 --> 00:42:42,152
LAURA: Gilmore, does the screen keep us hidden?

641
00:42:42,152 --> 00:42:50,198
MATT: You look back, and even in his most damaged
state, Gilmore had an essence of confidence, and

642
00:42:50,198 --> 00:42:58,532
this is a moment where you've never really seen
him so pale. "We're about to find out, aren't we?"

643
00:42:58,532 --> 00:43:00,588
TRAVIS: I'm going outside.

644
00:43:00,588 --> 00:43:01,739
LAURA: I'm going outside, too.

645
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:05,425
LIAM: I walk up to Shaun and slap my hand on his
forearm and say, what about the bow? Is there

646
00:43:05,425 --> 00:43:07,096
anything you can tell us about the bow?

647
00:43:07,096 --> 00:43:10,632
MATT: "In due time. Keep it at the ready."

648
00:43:10,632 --> 00:43:14,334
MARISHA: I turn to Cassandra. We need to get all
of the citizens underground, immediately.

649
00:43:14,334 --> 00:43:17,399
TALIESIN: We can't fit everybody.

650
00:43:17,399 --> 00:43:21,096
MATT: "We can certainly try." She turns to the
guard. "Gather everyone we can. Gather--" And

651
00:43:21,096 --> 00:43:26,132
there's another roar from outside, this time
louder still. "Go! Now!" Everyone starts rushing

652
00:43:26,132 --> 00:43:28,545
down the stairs to the outside of Whitestone
Castle.

653
00:43:28,545 --> 00:43:32,188
MARISHA: I go out and I do a Skywrite in the sky
again.

654
00:43:32,188 --> 00:43:34,161
LAURA: Wait! Skywrite?

655
00:43:34,161 --> 00:43:37,105
MARISHA: They already know we're here!

656
00:43:37,105 --> 00:43:39,854
LAURA: No, they don't! They don't necessarily.

657
00:43:39,854 --> 00:43:43,737
MARISHA: Making pictures in the clouds right above
the city. It's fine.

658
00:43:43,737 --> 00:43:46,574
SAM: Maybe not.

659
00:43:46,574 --> 00:43:50,199
LAURA: I wouldn't Skywrite anything right now,
Keyleth. That screen could keep us hidden. He

660
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:51,990
could be searching for us right now.

661
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:56,198
MARISHA: And what about the citizens?

662
00:43:56,198 --> 00:44:01,435
SAM: We'll find another way to alert them. Send
out the dog. I don't know.

663
00:44:01,435 --> 00:44:02,995
MATT: Are you guys exiting the castle now?

664
00:44:02,995 --> 00:44:04,176
LAURA: Yes.

665
00:44:04,176 --> 00:44:07,987
MARISHA: Do it by hand? We might not have that
much time.

666
00:44:07,987 --> 00:44:13,936
MATT: As you step out into the front open patio
area, just outside of the castle's main gates, you

667
00:44:13,936 --> 00:44:18,982
look up and that faint blue shimmer that encases--
and you can now see it as a dome, and it comes

668
00:44:18,982 --> 00:44:26,276
down around, just directly around the city,
closing at the very outskirts of the castle. You

669
00:44:26,276 --> 00:44:31,840
look in the distance as you see a few dark shapes
growing larger and larger.

670
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,306
MARISHA: They're coming this way!

671
00:44:33,306 --> 00:44:34,448
TALIESIN: Hold.

672
00:44:34,448 --> 00:44:36,556
MATT: I need you to make a perception check, all
of you.

673
00:44:36,556 --> 00:44:37,852
MARISHA: Fuck!

674
00:44:37,852 --> 00:44:44,784
TRAVIS: 17.

675
00:44:44,784 --> 00:44:46,385
SAM: Nine.

676
00:44:46,385 --> 00:44:47,418
MARISHA: 26.

677
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:48,190
TALIESIN: 23.

678
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:49,018
LIAM: 26.

679
00:44:49,018 --> 00:44:49,943
LAURA: 16.

680
00:44:49,943 --> 00:44:59,843
MATT: All right. Vax, Keyleth, and Percy. You guys
glance off and you can see there are a number of

681
00:44:59,843 --> 00:45:08,986
shapes. It looks to be probably two, three dozen
large winged entities flapping.

682
00:45:08,986 --> 00:45:12,860
You can't make out too much of the detail
of their form, but you can definitely see some

683
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:17,427
sort of aerial transport with large wings. At the
forefront of them, you see one far larger than the

684
00:45:17,427 --> 00:45:22,841
rest. While you can't make out the details at this
distance, the one thing you do catch is the bits

685
00:45:22,841 --> 00:45:27,965
of sunlight that peek through the clouds, hitting
the side of its hide. A bright, piercing white color.

686
00:45:27,965 --> 00:45:30,943
TRAVIS: Fucking fucked.

687
00:45:30,943 --> 00:45:38,526
MATT: You see it coasting at an angle around the
outside of the city, making its way very quickly

688
00:45:38,526 --> 00:45:40,574
towards the outskirts of the town.

689
00:45:40,574 --> 00:45:45,497
MARISHA: It's Thordak's army. Asum said himself
we're eastward. We're directly in its path.

690
00:45:45,497 --> 00:45:47,817
TALIESIN: Hold.

691
00:45:47,817 --> 00:45:50,470
MARISHA: Dragons have truesight. They already know
we're here.

692
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:52,686
SAM: Maybe they can't get through this.

693
00:45:52,686 --> 00:45:55,878
MARISHA: Any second we wait longer, more people
could die!

694
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,634
LAURA: Send out the guards.

695
00:45:57,634 --> 00:46:01,237
MATT: The guards are already running down, by the
way, based on Cassandra's orders, and are making

696
00:46:01,237 --> 00:46:05,317
their way towards the city. You can already see
people coming out of the streets and looking up,

697
00:46:05,317 --> 00:46:07,940
covering their ears. Some people are falling to
their knees and crying.

698
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:08,963
MARISHA: Percy.

699
00:46:08,963 --> 00:46:10,882
TALIESIN: Pick them up. Keep running until the
moment they can't.

700
00:46:10,882 --> 00:46:13,882
LIAM: They know we're here. This is not a
coincidence. They're not flying by. They know

701
00:46:13,882 --> 00:46:15,759
we're here. They know.

702
00:46:15,759 --> 00:46:21,929
MATT: (whoosh) You now see the dragon and the
flying horde have just come within a mile of the

703
00:46:21,929 --> 00:46:23,958
southern portion of the city.

704
00:46:23,958 --> 00:46:24,796
MARISHA: Percy!

705
00:46:24,796 --> 00:46:25,865
TALIESIN: Wait!

706
00:46:25,865 --> 00:46:26,696
LIAM: Do it.

707
00:46:26,696 --> 00:46:27,701
LAURA: No. Don't do it!

708
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:28,666
LIAM: They're coming for us!

709
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:29,841
TALIESIN: This is my home. Wait.

710
00:46:29,841 --> 00:46:31,304
TRAVIS: This is his home.

711
00:46:31,304 --> 00:46:32,607
MARISHA: Percy.

712
00:46:32,607 --> 00:46:33,808
TALIESIN: Keep moving.

713
00:46:33,808 --> 00:46:37,772
MARISHA: You have five seconds to come up with a
better fucking plan, or I am doing it.

714
00:46:37,772 --> 00:46:40,669
TALIESIN: Spread out. Keep moving. Find a
position.

715
00:46:40,669 --> 00:46:44,407
MATT: Okay. What order are you guys rushing down
in?

716
00:46:44,407 --> 00:46:47,114
LIAM: What are we looking at from our vantage
point?

717
00:46:47,114 --> 00:46:52,899
MATT: You guys are looking down at the wide,
60-foot earth path that leads down from the base

718
00:46:52,899 --> 00:46:55,707
of Castle Whitestone into the city itself.

719
00:46:55,707 --> 00:46:59,742
TALIESIN: If I'm towards the front, I'm moving
everyone towards the house where we made the

720
00:46:59,742 --> 00:47:01,714
tunnel that goes underneath the Sun Tree.

721
00:47:01,714 --> 00:47:03,353
MATT: All right, so we have Percy at the front.

722
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:04,956
TRAVIS: I'll be right behind him.

723
00:47:04,956 --> 00:47:06,286
MATT: Okay, Grog's right behind Percy.

724
00:47:06,286 --> 00:47:07,509
LAURA: I'll follow behind Grog.

725
00:47:07,509 --> 00:47:09,659
LIAM: We're up above, though? Or are we on ground
level at this point?

726
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:13,149
MATT: You guys are now on ground level. You're
above on the grade that leads down into the city itself.

727
00:47:13,149 --> 00:47:15,012
LAURA: I pull out the broom and I get on the
broom.

728
00:47:15,012 --> 00:47:16,325
MATT: Okay, so you're on the broom.

729
00:47:16,325 --> 00:47:18,267
MARISHA: It's clear they're not deviating the
path.

730
00:47:18,267 --> 00:47:22,558
LAURA: It's not clear. We could just be in their
way.

731
00:47:22,558 --> 00:47:23,854
TRAVIS: He said they're curving.

732
00:47:23,854 --> 00:47:28,493
MATT: They're now curving around the outside of
the western side of the valley.

733
00:47:28,493 --> 00:47:30,184
TALIESIN: What are you going to write? What are
you going to write?

734
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:34,485
MARISHA: I would throw up the De Rolo crest, just
like before. It's a good alert sign.

735
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:38,002
LAURA: People would just come out screaming. They
won't know where to go.

736
00:47:38,002 --> 00:47:41,736
MARISHA: Then come up with a better damn plan.

737
00:47:41,736 --> 00:47:49,994
MATT: (roar) Echoing through the valley. You watch
as the entire crowd of these entities flies around

738
00:47:49,994 --> 00:47:57,505
the west side of the city, curves past. The shadow
of the light of the sky, you can see the dark,

739
00:47:57,505 --> 00:48:04,148
heavy shadow of the dragon and the wyverns pass
over the western side of the city. You can hear

740
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:11,702
distant screams as people begin to freak out at
this. It passes over the western side of the city,

741
00:48:11,702 --> 00:48:13,727
flying right towards the castle.

742
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:15,304
MARISHA: Percy.

743
00:48:15,304 --> 00:48:27,536
MATT: Arcs past the castle, over the forest, and
the entire cluster slowly flaps down and lands at

744
00:48:27,536 --> 00:48:32,949
the southernmost beginning peak of the Alabaster
Sierras, just north of the city. The dragon

745
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:34,560
(crash noise) lands.

746
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,670
TALIESIN: Alert everyone you see.

747
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:39,859
MARISHA: They're scouting us.

748
00:48:39,859 --> 00:48:41,708
TALIESIN: Tell them to get underground. Tell them
to be silent.

749
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:43,286
LAURA: They don't see us, but they know we're
nearby.

750
00:48:43,286 --> 00:48:44,566
TRAVIS: What direction are they looking?

751
00:48:44,566 --> 00:48:47,762
MATT: Right now, they're looking in all
directions, actually.

752
00:48:47,762 --> 00:48:50,405
LAURA: We need to get everybody underground while
we can.

753
00:48:50,405 --> 00:48:52,195
LIAM: We have time. We have time.

754
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:59,158
TALIESIN: Thank you. Find everyone. Tell them,
silence. We still have the cavern we built

755
00:48:59,158 --> 00:49:01,363
underground. Start making it larger.

756
00:49:01,363 --> 00:49:02,353
MARISHA: Okay.

757
00:49:02,353 --> 00:49:03,803
TRAVIS: Shall we scatter? Spread the word?

758
00:49:03,803 --> 00:49:05,359
LAURA: Spread the word. Tell everyone to get
underground.

759
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,557
TALIESIN: Under the tree.

760
00:49:06,557 --> 00:49:10,561
MARISHA: I go to the cavern under the Sun Tree and
I start casting Move Earth and I start clearing it

761
00:49:10,561 --> 00:49:11,760
as fast as I can.

762
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,919
MATT: Okay. It's going to take you a while, but
you begin building this cavern.

763
00:49:13,919 --> 00:49:15,252
MARISHA: As fast as I can.

764
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:16,258
TALIESIN: More people.

765
00:49:16,258 --> 00:49:17,480
SAM: Where are we telling people to go?

766
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,668
TRAVIS: We're scattering.

767
00:49:18,668 --> 00:49:21,206
TALIESIN: There's the inn that was broken. It's
got an entrance. They either go there or they go

768
00:49:21,206 --> 00:49:22,496
underneath the castle.

769
00:49:22,496 --> 00:49:25,316
SAM: That can hold 30, 40 people?

770
00:49:25,316 --> 00:49:26,506
TALIESIN: She's making it bigger.

771
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:28,106
LAURA: Can we send people under the castle as
well?

772
00:49:28,106 --> 00:49:29,163
SAM: Okay, under the castle, yeah.

773
00:49:29,163 --> 00:49:35,206
MATT: You guys all begin scattering, grabbing
everyone you can. The guards are starting to

774
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:38,835
gather people, and as you get the word out, people
begin to quiet, holding their mouths. The guards

775
00:49:38,835 --> 00:49:45,673
are holding people silently. People begin ushering
en masse up towards this giant exodus from the

776
00:49:45,673 --> 00:49:51,512
city, pouring like a funnel up this walkway to the
base of Castle Whitestone. Keyleth, as you're down

777
00:49:51,512 --> 00:49:56,163
there, you're pressing. The dirt itself is slowly
molding its way into this large cavern, pressing

778
00:49:56,163 --> 00:49:59,000
downward further and further and opening, further
down and opening.

779
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,951
MARISHA: Fallout cavern style. Big, lower, bigger,
lower.

780
00:50:02,951 --> 00:50:06,847
MATT: You get about three platforms down before
the earth stops responding.

781
00:50:06,847 --> 00:50:08,696
MARISHA: What do you mean?

782
00:50:08,696 --> 00:50:09,885
TRAVIS: Fucking ziggurat!

783
00:50:09,885 --> 00:50:11,052
MARISHA: The fucking ziggurat!

784
00:50:11,052 --> 00:50:12,911
TALIESIN: Other way, other way!

785
00:50:12,911 --> 00:50:14,141
MARISHA: I go the other way!

786
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:17,636
LAURA: Don't empty out the earth too much, or it
won't support the city.

787
00:50:17,636 --> 00:50:19,619
MARISHA: Fallout style. Little pods.

788
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:23,228
MATT: All right. You start creating all these
various things, and people start ushering in. It's

789
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:27,056
getting to the point now where there's so many
people. You hear crying children, families pressed

790
00:50:27,056 --> 00:50:30,667
in, you're feeling claustrophobic and the room's
getting hotter and hotter the more bodies that are

791
00:50:30,667 --> 00:50:34,418
in there. You keep concentrating and pushing the
earth out. You can feel the sweat beads pouring

792
00:50:34,418 --> 00:50:38,357
down your face, concentrating, concentrating. You
hear the crying and sobbing, and people trying to

793
00:50:38,357 --> 00:50:44,041
comfort those that are freaking out. Every now and
then you hear a distant echoing cry, a scream of a

794
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:48,158
dragon in the distance, and everyone in the room
tenses, and the sobbing gets even louder, then

795
00:50:48,158 --> 00:50:53,707
hushed again with whispering silence. You keep
pushing and keep pushing, opening. You guys all

796
00:50:53,707 --> 00:50:58,798
begin to gather the rest as you watch, with that
final cry, the dragon and the wyverns pick up

797
00:50:58,798 --> 00:51:09,762
(whoosh) and swoop towards the center of the
valley, arcing to the west, and do a wide sweep of

798
00:51:09,762 --> 00:51:16,638
the mountain range. (flapping wings)

799
00:51:16,638 --> 00:51:18,003
LAURA: Where's Gilmore?

800
00:51:18,003 --> 00:51:21,876
MATT: Gilmore has been bringing people en masse
down to the castle. You haven't seen him for a number

801
00:51:21,876 --> 00:51:31,796
of-- probably 15, 20 minutes or so. The dragons
coast around, and begin to disappear in the

802
00:51:31,796 --> 00:51:45,665
southeastern distance where they came from. You
do, at this point, catch Gilmore, who has moved to

803
00:51:45,665 --> 00:51:50,651
the top of the castle and is currently, arms out,
concentrating, pouring all the energy he can into

804
00:51:50,651 --> 00:51:52,225
that barrier.

805
00:51:52,225 --> 00:51:55,026
TRAVIS: Looks like the spell worked.

806
00:51:55,026 --> 00:51:58,551
LIAM: Good work. Good work.

807
00:51:58,551 --> 00:52:05,013
LAURA: Gilmore. Good job.

808
00:52:05,013 --> 00:52:10,759
MATT: He eventually comes down from the top of the
castle. He is-- eye sockets are sunken. You can

809
00:52:10,759 --> 00:52:21,246
see he's pouring with sweat. "I'm going to need a
spa day. Because I'm <i>done</i>."

810
00:52:21,246 --> 00:52:24,330
LAURA: Where's Pike?

811
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:32,989
MATT: You guys find Pike. She, during this whole
period, was over by the temple of Pelor that she

812
00:52:32,989 --> 00:52:39,907
was helping right and construct. Going over and
finding out where she's been placed, you guys see

813
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:44,091
that she's shepherded in a good 200 people into
that temple, and has been keeping them divinely

814
00:52:44,091 --> 00:52:47,601
protected the whole time. As soon as you approach
the outside, the people begin to slowly disperse

815
00:52:47,601 --> 00:52:54,826
back into the city. Pike walks out, looking out to
the sky and locks eyes with you. "You're back!"

816
00:52:54,826 --> 00:52:59,905
Runs up and gives you a big hug. Jumps into your
arms at this point. You catch her, and realize how

817
00:52:59,905 --> 00:53:02,402
heavy she is with the armor on, put her back
down.

818
00:53:02,402 --> 00:53:04,809
LAURA: I drop her, because I'm fucking weak.

819
00:53:04,809 --> 00:53:09,053
MATT: "Guys! Hi!"

820
00:53:09,053 --> 00:53:11,060
LAURA: You did an amazing job with that.

821
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:19,158
MATT: "That was mostly him. I've never done
something like that before. That was-- everything

822
00:53:19,158 --> 00:53:23,230
"okay in the Feywild? I'm sorry, I lost my
connection. We had to finish this ritual."

823
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:24,614
LAURA: No, it was fine.

824
00:53:24,614 --> 00:53:27,258
MARISHA: Hi, Pike. Sorry.

825
00:53:27,258 --> 00:53:29,765
MATT: "Don't be. I'm glad you're all okay."

826
00:53:29,765 --> 00:53:32,301
SAM: Do you remember the Feywild?

827
00:53:32,301 --> 00:53:35,264
MATT: "Yeah. We were--"

828
00:53:35,264 --> 00:53:37,051
SAM: Okay. Just making sure.

829
00:53:37,051 --> 00:53:39,104
LAURA: He doesn't remember, Pike.

830
00:53:39,104 --> 00:53:40,991
MATT: "You don't remember?"

831
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:44,997
TRAVIS: Yeah. Apparently, we went to the Feywild,
and everybody remembers it but me and Percy.

832
00:53:44,997 --> 00:53:48,446
MATT: "Why is that?"

833
00:53:48,446 --> 00:53:50,210
LAURA: I don't know.

834
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:51,833
TALIESIN: It's funnier that way.

835
00:53:51,833 --> 00:53:53,857
MARISHA: Maybe you can look at his head later.

836
00:53:53,857 --> 00:53:55,855
LAURA: Maybe there's a way to cure it.

837
00:53:55,855 --> 00:53:57,606
TRAVIS: I'm just too smart.

838
00:53:57,606 --> 00:54:01,452
MATT: She walks up and takes a look at you, walks
up to Grog. Has a good look at the side of your

839
00:54:01,452 --> 00:54:03,828
head, knocks you in the temple a few times.

840
00:54:03,828 --> 00:54:05,990
TRAVIS: What do you see?

841
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:16,755
MATT: "There's nothing... physical. I'll try a
restoration." She would have, let's see here.

842
00:54:16,755 --> 00:54:19,712
SAM: Pike stats!

843
00:54:19,712 --> 00:54:22,613
TALIESIN: I was about to say, you have an Ashley
app. That's so adorable.

844
00:54:22,613 --> 00:54:24,311
TRAVIS: Don't make me any dumber.

845
00:54:24,311 --> 00:54:27,241
LAURA: Grog, that's not possible.

846
00:54:27,241 --> 00:54:32,285
MATT: Yeah, she's going to try Greater
Restoration. Let me check something here real fast.

847
00:54:32,285 --> 00:54:39,339
SAM: That was not fun.

848
00:54:39,339 --> 00:54:40,474
LAURA: No.

849
00:54:40,474 --> 00:54:44,391
MARISHA: Percy, are you sure it's okay for me to
let these people out?

850
00:54:44,391 --> 00:54:51,951
TALIESIN: Of course it's not, but yes, definitely
let them out. We'll have to make it more secure

851
00:54:51,951 --> 00:54:53,091
and safer.

852
00:54:53,091 --> 00:54:55,218
LAURA: I think it's gotten quite a bit away from
us.

853
00:54:55,218 --> 00:54:59,006
MATT: So Pike reaches up. The gauntlets begin to
glow, and as she touches each side of your

854
00:54:59,006 --> 00:55:04,636
temples, your eyes close. As some of you watch
this, Grog's eyes flash open, and where his pupils

855
00:55:04,636 --> 00:55:12,398
and the whites of his eyes were, you now see a
flash of divine golden orange light. As it fades,

856
00:55:12,398 --> 00:55:17,754
you are slammed with a series of memories that
were previously taken from you, and you recall

857
00:55:17,754 --> 00:55:19,348
every moment in the Feywild.

858
00:55:19,348 --> 00:55:22,957
TRAVIS: (surprised noises)

859
00:55:22,957 --> 00:55:30,560
SAM: I'm sorry! I'm sorry, you didn't get to kill
anything. I'm sorry.

860
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,167
LAURA: No, he did! He still killed the big bad
guy!

861
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:34,318
SAM: Oh, you did! You did, you killed the one
thing. Okay, good.

862
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:37,618
TRAVIS: I got petrified!

863
00:55:37,618 --> 00:55:39,353
LAURA: Yeah, well, stoned.

864
00:55:39,353 --> 00:55:42,109
TRAVIS: I tried diplomacy! Never again.

865
00:55:42,109 --> 00:55:44,351
SAM: Lesson learned.

866
00:55:44,351 --> 00:55:45,714
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

867
00:55:45,714 --> 00:55:47,662
LAURA: Can you only do that one time a day?

868
00:55:47,662 --> 00:55:49,428
MATT: "No, I can do it once more."

869
00:55:49,428 --> 00:55:52,760
SAM: Maybe... well...

870
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:56,441
TRAVIS: No, it's okay, yeah! Percy will
remember the nude massage.

871
00:55:56,441 --> 00:55:59,990
MATT: She walks up to Percy.

872
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:01,618
LIAM: Think of what he's losing, though.

873
00:56:01,618 --> 00:56:03,161
TALIESIN: I'm not losing it.

874
00:56:03,161 --> 00:56:04,329
LAURA: Potentially.

875
00:56:04,329 --> 00:56:06,701
TALIESIN: No, because it doesn't matter. It's
there anyway.

876
00:56:06,701 --> 00:56:08,267
SAM: Actually, I don't know. I don't know.

877
00:56:08,267 --> 00:56:14,160
MATT: Yeah, you have overlapping memories. So she
reaches up and you bend down. She takes your

878
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:22,248
glasses off. Hands them to Vex. Reaches up and
touches the sides of your temple. "Now,

879
00:56:22,248 --> 00:56:29,618
"concentrate." Close your eyes, and there's a burst
of warmth towards the front of your lobe, almost

880
00:56:29,618 --> 00:56:35,558
like someone's dipping your head into hot water.
And with that, there's a smattering of memories

881
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:40,467
that are rushing into your mind. It takes you a
moment. Your head swims, and you have to almost

882
00:56:40,467 --> 00:56:44,996
sit down. You almost stumble off your back foot as
your brain now has to reorganize those lost

883
00:56:44,996 --> 00:56:47,671
moments. Seven days now immediately restored.

884
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:49,281
TALIESIN: Seven days, ten minutes.

885
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:52,089
SAM: Greater Restoration kills Modify Memory.

886
00:56:52,089 --> 00:56:56,804
TALIESIN: Oh! But do I remember having the fake
memory? Or do I not remember having a fake

887
00:56:56,804 --> 00:56:57,703
memory?

888
00:56:57,703 --> 00:56:59,733
MATT: You would remember the spell being cast. You
remember the fake memory, but you're aware that

889
00:56:59,733 --> 00:57:00,674
it's fake.

890
00:57:00,674 --> 00:57:02,351
SAM: And that I did it?

891
00:57:02,351 --> 00:57:03,250
TALIESIN: Yes.

892
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:04,016
MATT: Oh yeah.

893
00:57:04,016 --> 00:57:05,108
SAM: Fuck.

894
00:57:05,108 --> 00:57:13,662
LIAM: Just say thank you, Percival.

895
00:57:13,662 --> 00:57:16,270
MATT: "Did it work?"

896
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:27,049
TALIESIN: I give her a big hug. I'm so tired. I'm
sorry. I'm going to sit down.

897
00:57:27,049 --> 00:57:30,816
LAURA: What?

898
00:57:30,816 --> 00:57:32,120
MATT: "Glasses?"

899
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:35,203
LAURA: Oh, but they're so fun to look through! All
right.

900
00:57:35,203 --> 00:57:36,619
TALIESIN: They'll give you a headache.

901
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,586
MATT: She takes the glasses, and as you're
resting, she takes your hand away from your head

902
00:57:38,586 --> 00:57:40,204
and puts them back on.

903
00:57:40,204 --> 00:57:43,121
MARISHA: I start slowly releasing people from the
pods.

904
00:57:43,121 --> 00:57:44,273
TALIESIN: Thank you.

905
00:57:44,273 --> 00:57:51,463
MATT: People begin to emerge, and where once there
was this air of tension, fear, and desolate

906
00:57:51,463 --> 00:57:58,510
acceptance of the end, there's laughter. There's
smiles, and even more tears as people begin to

907
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:00,446
realize they have another day to live.

908
00:58:00,446 --> 00:58:09,113
LAURA: Can we tell the people as they come out, I
know you'll want to celebrate, but please keep it

909
00:58:09,113 --> 00:58:12,087
as quiet as possible tonight. We don't know when
it could be back.

910
00:58:12,087 --> 00:58:18,354
MATT: There's a stillness and a slow understanding
and nodding. While everyone takes in the

911
00:58:18,354 --> 00:58:24,696
information, one young woman, smeared dirt on her
chin, dried tears on her cheek, steps forward and

912
00:58:24,696 --> 00:58:32,978
goes, "Thank you. Thank you." And everyone else
starts saying, "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."

913
00:58:32,978 --> 00:58:37,341
This sea of thank-yous begins to spread through
the crowd immediately in your vicinity.

914
00:58:37,341 --> 00:58:39,990
SAM: Don't thank us. Thank Shaun Gilmore.

915
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:41,671
LAURA: Gilmore and Pike. Allura.

916
00:58:41,671 --> 00:58:49,577
MATT: They all quietly go back to their silence
and begin to slowly disperse themselves throughout

917
00:58:49,577 --> 00:58:52,895
the city where they were before this incursion
happened.

918
00:58:52,895 --> 00:58:57,082
MARISHA: I go up to Percy.

919
00:58:57,082 --> 00:59:00,845
TRAVIS: I forgot that Shaun was Gilmore's first
name.

920
00:59:00,845 --> 00:59:03,410
LAURA: He was like, who's Shaun?

921
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:05,631
SAM: Intelligence of six.

922
00:59:05,631 --> 00:59:08,808
LIAM: So fucking method. Method, man.

923
00:59:08,808 --> 00:59:10,072
MATT: Keyleth.

924
00:59:10,072 --> 00:59:13,410
MARISHA: I hope you know that I would never--

925
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:21,842
TALIESIN: Shut up. Thank you.

926
00:59:21,842 --> 00:59:29,474
SAM: I hope you know that I was only trying to
improve your life with a wonderful happy memory,

927
00:59:29,474 --> 00:59:35,082
and it was mostly true.

928
00:59:35,082 --> 00:59:39,514
TALIESIN: I know where you sleep. People work
for me.

929
00:59:39,514 --> 00:59:48,216
MATT: Asum has caught up to you now as you guys
are walking back to the city. You can see him.

930
00:59:48,216 --> 00:59:55,182
He's still, eyes to the sky, not truly trusting
this quiet. He goes, "It seems we don't have any

931
00:59:55,182 --> 01:00:00,977
"time to lose. What resources do you have to fight
back? What have you learned? Please tell me you

932
01:00:00,977 --> 01:00:02,856
"have better news than I have."

933
01:00:02,856 --> 01:00:06,974
TRAVIS: Well, we've got a few of these Vestiges, so
we're a little powered up. But we're not quite

934
01:00:06,974 --> 01:00:12,746
sure what their full abilities are. It's
significant, but we think they do more, we're just

935
01:00:12,746 --> 01:00:14,321
not sure how much.

936
01:00:14,321 --> 01:00:15,671
MATT: "What more do you need?"

937
01:00:15,671 --> 01:00:18,286
LAURA: Can I fly up in the air while this
conversation's going on?

938
01:00:18,286 --> 01:00:19,236
MATT: Sure.

939
01:00:19,236 --> 01:00:20,458
SAM: Don't go too high.

940
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:21,324
LAURA: Not too high.

941
01:00:21,324 --> 01:00:22,569
SAM: We don't know where the thing is.

942
01:00:22,569 --> 01:00:24,437
LAURA: No, I know, I want to go to the very top
where I see the shimmer.

943
01:00:24,437 --> 01:00:30,167
MATT: Yeah and it's a squat shimmer, not a full
dome and it's like a very extended type dome.

944
01:00:30,167 --> 01:00:33,660
LAURA: Okay. But it's high enough, that I mean
it's higher than the castle.

945
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:38,092
MATT: It's high enough where you can get 
about 80 feet up and you start to see enough

946
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:42,463
detail in the shimmer where you're like, "Okay,
I'm getting close."

947
01:00:42,463 --> 01:00:54,468
LAURA: Okay. The direction that the dragons went.
Is this stupid? Can I shoot my Oracle Arrow in

948
01:00:54,468 --> 01:00:56,098
that direction?

949
01:00:56,098 --> 01:00:57,481
SAM: No. Absolutely not.

950
01:00:57,481 --> 01:00:58,435
LAURA: Why?

951
01:00:58,435 --> 01:01:00,795
SAM: (high-pitched) Why would you bring attention
to us?!

952
01:01:00,795 --> 01:01:02,073
LAURA: It's an arrow!

953
01:01:02,073 --> 01:01:03,490
LIAM: They're long gone.

954
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:10,201
MATT: They are gone. The time has passed. They're
miles and miles and miles and miles and miles at

955
01:01:10,201 --> 01:01:16,050
the speed they were travelling. You're a good shot,
but I don't know if you could arc an arrow that far.

956
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:21,894
LAURA: Oh well, I guess that's true. I thought it
was a ten-minute, because it's Fenthras I thought

957
01:01:21,894 --> 01:01:23,396
it was a long-ass arrow.

958
01:01:23,396 --> 01:01:24,972
TRAVIS: Can't you tell what direction the dragons
were heading?

959
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:30,619
LAURA: Oh! Wait, okay, so the Oracle Arrow, is it
like you fire it, and then it shoots somewhere and

960
01:01:30,619 --> 01:01:32,439
it sticks there and I can see through it for ten
minutes?

961
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:35,912
MATT: Correct. Or see through it as it's fired,
the minute it leaves the bow you can project your

962
01:01:35,912 --> 01:01:37,993
sight through the arrow for up to 10 minutes.

963
01:01:37,993 --> 01:01:39,245
SAM: It can't fly for infinity?

964
01:01:39,245 --> 01:01:42,807
MATT: No. It still arcs like a regular arrow.

965
01:01:42,807 --> 01:01:46,697
LAURA: That makes sense. I foresaw it just going,
because I thought it was like a special kind of

966
01:01:46,697 --> 01:01:47,580
arrow.

967
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:49,435
LIAM: It's really good for people without flying
brooms.

968
01:01:49,435 --> 01:01:56,718
LAURA: Right. Cool. Then I'm not going to use it.
Because now I understand how it works. I've

969
01:01:56,718 --> 01:01:58,246
learned something.

970
01:01:58,246 --> 01:02:02,753
TALIESIN: What direction were the wyverns
travelling, were they travelling back? Or were

971
01:02:02,753 --> 01:02:03,711
they travelling along--

972
01:02:03,711 --> 01:02:04,787
MATT: They were heading southeast.

973
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:06,720
TRAVIS: So not back, they came from the west,
right?

974
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:10,838
MATT: They swooped in from the west, from that
side.

975
01:02:10,838 --> 01:02:14,610
TALIESIN: But they originated in the west, and
they are currently travelling southeast?

976
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:19,047
MATT: Correct. However, it was Vorugal, it was the
white dragon, which from what Gilmore is saying

977
01:02:19,047 --> 01:02:22,764
has been roosting over at the top of the ruins of
Draconia.

978
01:02:22,764 --> 01:02:23,971
TALIESIN: Which is to the east.

979
01:02:23,971 --> 01:02:27,139
SAM: So this was not the group that had set off
from Emon.

980
01:02:27,139 --> 01:02:28,186
TRAVIS: To the west.

981
01:02:28,186 --> 01:02:29,933
TALIESIN: No it's-- Draconia is to the southeast.
Why do I know that?

982
01:02:29,933 --> 01:02:34,892
SAM: Here, here's the map. We're up here. This is
the group that was coming from Emon. These guys

983
01:02:34,892 --> 01:02:37,126
came from somewhere over here? Where's Draconia?

984
01:02:37,126 --> 01:02:42,184
LAURA: Can I cast Primeval Awareness and see if
it's within six miles of us right now, still? Or

985
01:02:42,184 --> 01:02:43,715
if it's farther away from that.

986
01:02:43,715 --> 01:02:46,600
MARISHA: I thought that Draconia's on a whole
another continent.

987
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,704
TALIESIN: Yeah, it is. It's over here.

988
01:02:48,704 --> 01:02:50,040
MATT: It's over on Wildemount.

989
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:54,992
LAURA: I want to see if they're just camping out
around us or if they're going away.

990
01:02:54,992 --> 01:02:56,604
TALIESIN: Are they going back?

991
01:02:56,604 --> 01:02:58,809
MATT: Using for dragons, I assume, right?

992
01:02:58,809 --> 01:03:03,474
LAURA: Yes. It's my favored enemy.

993
01:03:03,474 --> 01:03:07,270
MATT: Yeah. I would say as part of your Primeval
Awareness--

994
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:12,538
SAM: If this is the United States, we're in Maine.
Emon is LA.

995
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:19,445
MATT: Yeah. Sensing at this point, with the day of
travel and everything, you have no sense of

996
01:03:19,445 --> 01:03:21,718
dragons in that direction or anything.

997
01:03:21,718 --> 01:03:23,711
LAURA: Okay. They're further than six miles away.

998
01:03:23,711 --> 01:03:31,044
MATT: Yeah, there are minor essences in the
northern area, but nothing beyond what you've

999
01:03:31,044 --> 01:03:36,673
already sensed in the Alabaster Sierras. Nothing
on the level of strength that the draw of an

1000
01:03:36,673 --> 01:03:39,943
ancient dragon would bring on your radar.

1001
01:03:39,943 --> 01:03:40,974
LAURA: Okay.

1002
01:03:40,974 --> 01:03:49,614
TRAVIS: To answer your previous question, there
are four Vestiges left.

1003
01:03:49,614 --> 01:03:51,524
TALIESIN: That we know of.

1004
01:03:51,524 --> 01:03:59,605
LIAM: There's a dagger, there's a cloak. Armor.
There's a staff.

1005
01:03:59,605 --> 01:04:02,083
SAM: Wait, there's other objects that we
haven't--

1006
01:04:02,083 --> 01:04:03,701
MATT: "All right."

1007
01:04:03,701 --> 01:04:05,542
MARISHA: Four left. Because we have Whisper,
right?

1008
01:04:05,542 --> 01:04:07,333
LAURA: No, no, we don't have Whisper.

1009
01:04:07,333 --> 01:04:09,035
MARISHA: So there's five.

1010
01:04:09,035 --> 01:04:13,802
MATT: "Do we have any other allies, friends,
people who are sworn to aid us and--?"

1011
01:04:13,802 --> 01:04:16,076
TRAVIS: Ooh! Yeah, yeah! Your parents.

1012
01:04:16,076 --> 01:04:17,452
MARISHA: Yeah.

1013
01:04:17,452 --> 01:04:18,617
TALIESIN: That's right.

1014
01:04:18,617 --> 01:04:25,267
LAURA: Technically, the elves of Syngorn are
building an army. However, who knows if they'll

1015
01:04:25,267 --> 01:04:26,711
actually come through.

1016
01:04:26,711 --> 01:04:27,984
TALIESIN: The werewolves could be called upon.

1017
01:04:27,984 --> 01:04:30,905
MATT: "I think they would understand it would do
them well to help what is a threat to all of us."

1018
01:04:30,905 --> 01:04:32,493
TALIESIN: You would think.

1019
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:34,612
SAM: One werewolf has vowed allegiance to us.

1020
01:04:34,612 --> 01:04:36,251
LAURA: In the Feywild.

1021
01:04:36,251 --> 01:04:39,514
TRAVIS: In another plane of existence, which I
don't know if that's a problem.

1022
01:04:39,514 --> 01:04:41,215
MATT: "Not going to count on that one."

1023
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:44,451
TALIESIN: It's not as ridiculous as you think.

1024
01:04:44,451 --> 01:04:47,183
SAM: Yes. Your former pals.

1025
01:04:47,183 --> 01:04:50,290
TALIESIN: Whatever remnants of Draconia perhaps?

1026
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:56,476
MATT: "Wait. So the last time we saw the main
portion, the bulk of Emon's army from Fort Daxio was

1027
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:59,665
"sent to Syngorn before this attack happened?"

1028
01:04:59,665 --> 01:05:00,591
MARISHA: Yes.

1029
01:05:00,591 --> 01:05:02,149
MATT: "Do we have any knowledge on their
whereabouts?"

1030
01:05:02,149 --> 01:05:03,501
MARISHA: A lot are there.

1031
01:05:03,501 --> 01:05:04,942
MATT: "They're there?"

1032
01:05:04,942 --> 01:05:11,636
MARISHA: A lot of-- at least all of our guards from
Emon are in Syngorn, right?

1033
01:05:11,636 --> 01:05:13,716
LAURA: No. Our guards aren't in Syngorn.

1034
01:05:13,716 --> 01:05:15,526
MARISHA: Not our personal guards, but Emon's
guards.

1035
01:05:15,526 --> 01:05:16,900
LAURA: No.

1036
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:19,452
MATT: You did see quite a few soldiers from Emon
there.

1037
01:05:19,452 --> 01:05:21,285
LAURA: Oh we did?

1038
01:05:21,285 --> 01:05:22,148
SAM: Yes.

1039
01:05:22,148 --> 01:05:23,095
LAURA: I was distracted.

1040
01:05:23,095 --> 01:05:24,591
MATT: That's okay. You did have a lot to think
about with your dad.

1041
01:05:24,591 --> 01:05:28,986
TALIESIN: They would not answer our call but if
someone has relations with the Clasp, they are

1042
01:05:28,986 --> 01:05:31,229
always an option for manpower.

1043
01:05:31,229 --> 01:05:35,292
MATT: "Well, I have been dealing with them and
definitely-- they're not much of an army, but

1044
01:05:35,292 --> 01:05:40,081
"they're definitely good at acquiring information
and I currently have a few of them trying to find

1045
01:05:40,081 --> 01:05:42,195
"out as much as they can about Thordak."

1046
01:05:42,195 --> 01:05:49,079
MARISHA: There's also the Ashari druids, who will
definitely want to help our cause.

1047
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:50,510
TALIESIN: This is very true.

1048
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:54,460
MATT: "That is good to know. Well, any more that
come your way or any possibilities you have to

1049
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:58,841
"bring more to our cause, please, do so."

1050
01:05:58,841 --> 01:06:06,736
SAM: There's a candle-maker who might help out. I
would put him in the strong maybe category as well.

1051
01:06:06,736 --> 01:06:08,574
TALIESIN: Don't mention that Vex flies.

1052
01:06:08,574 --> 01:06:16,759
MATT: "Good, well keep tabs on those you've found
and any possibilities of others, especially those

1053
01:06:16,759 --> 01:06:23,780
"who have... I don't know, more of these Vestiges
that you speak of, or armies at their disposal.

1054
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:28,220
"Big weapons, anything. I'll take anything at this
point really."

1055
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:34,896
TALIESIN: There are options but we need to discuss
what happened today. This changes some things.

1056
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:40,149
TRAVIS: Yeah, we need more offence, less defense. I
don't know if that will work a second time.

1057
01:06:40,149 --> 01:06:51,001
TALIESIN: You're mad. We need defense. This is not
a site of a victory, this is a site of our end. We

1058
01:06:51,001 --> 01:06:53,830
need bunkers.

1059
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:59,118
LAURA: Yeah. We need to move everybody underground
the same way we did in Emon.

1060
01:06:59,118 --> 01:07:03,988
MARISHA: I can spend more time fleshing out and
reinforcing the bunkers to make them--

1061
01:07:03,988 --> 01:07:08,131
TALIESIN: I'll discuss a warning system to get
people underground.

1062
01:07:08,131 --> 01:07:12,676
SAM: But when the dragon came here just now, they
saw nothing, correct?

1063
01:07:12,676 --> 01:07:13,948
TALIESIN: We hope.

1064
01:07:13,948 --> 01:07:20,141
SAM: Is there a way that we can spread false
rumors that the city of Whitestone has been

1065
01:07:20,141 --> 01:07:22,521
magically moved to another plane or something?

1066
01:07:22,521 --> 01:07:25,839
LAURA: That's wonderful. That's smart.

1067
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:30,189
SAM: Some way of getting that word to Draconia or
I don't--

1068
01:07:30,189 --> 01:07:34,636
TALIESIN: Putting the word out that we're other
places than we are. Putting the sound--

1069
01:07:34,636 --> 01:07:36,711
MATT: Asum thinks to himself and goes--

1070
01:07:36,711 --> 01:07:38,561
LIAM: Can't we drop it into the Clasp's pipeline?

1071
01:07:38,561 --> 01:07:42,881
MATT: "I can do that. Definitely. We can find a
way to get that information. There are a number

1072
01:07:42,881 --> 01:07:49,986
"who have sworn allegiance to Thordak and, you know.
Some folks who don't see honor but the necessity

1073
01:07:49,986 --> 01:07:54,068
"to stay alive override any sort of previous
friendships."

1074
01:07:54,068 --> 01:07:58,433
TRAVIS: Best not to mention our name. I don't
think we're cool with the Clasp after our last

1075
01:07:58,433 --> 01:07:59,420
meeting.

1076
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:00,943
LAURA: Yeah, they don't like us.

1077
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:05,641
MATT: "Good to know. I'll look about planting that
information. I'll do the best I can in that

1078
01:08:05,641 --> 01:08:11,138
"regard. I've been told that you've already felled
another of the Conclave, is that correct?"

1079
01:08:11,138 --> 01:08:12,038
TRAVIS: Yes.

1080
01:08:12,038 --> 01:08:13,886
LAURA: That's true. Umbrasyl. Dead and gone.

1081
01:08:13,886 --> 01:08:15,955
MATT: "That will certainly stir some attention
from them."

1082
01:08:15,955 --> 01:08:19,115
LAURA: Yeah, and if not that, then the message left
in there.

1083
01:08:19,115 --> 01:08:20,877
TALIESIN: They know we did it.

1084
01:08:20,877 --> 01:08:26,760
TRAVIS: Strange that he had all those wyverns with
him, though. Umbrasyl had none. He was by

1085
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:27,899
himself.

1086
01:08:27,899 --> 01:08:30,930
LIAM: They don't like each other, though, this is
some sort of loose partnership.

1087
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:37,212
TRAVIS: Yeah, but didn't they say the white one
was more savage. More emotional?

1088
01:08:37,212 --> 01:08:39,201
LAURA: The white one was more vain.

1089
01:08:39,201 --> 01:08:42,103
MARISHA: Yeah, the black one, Umbrasyl is the one
that's--

1090
01:08:42,103 --> 01:08:46,135
SAM: Oh you're right, the white one is a hunter,
it's primal. Hates others. You're right.

1091
01:08:46,135 --> 01:08:52,441
TALIESIN: Maybe the army's going to head to-- no,
we could be so lucky if it was on its way to

1092
01:08:52,441 --> 01:08:53,645
attack it.

1093
01:08:53,645 --> 01:08:55,087
MARISHA: Black ones like torture, right?

1094
01:08:55,087 --> 01:08:56,672
LAURA: Yeah, they like to make people suffer.

1095
01:08:56,672 --> 01:09:00,619
TALIESIN: I feel like there should be trading
cards.

1096
01:09:00,619 --> 01:09:01,794
SAM: So the white one's like Predator?

1097
01:09:01,794 --> 01:09:03,987
LAURA: Shut up! There's notes somewhere in here!

1098
01:09:03,987 --> 01:09:11,798
MATT: "Just be warned: fell one dragon, that might
make them nervous. Fell another and that's almost

1099
01:09:11,798 --> 01:09:13,463
"certain to bring retaliation."

1100
01:09:13,463 --> 01:09:16,093
TALIESIN: We were hoping to distract them.

1101
01:09:16,093 --> 01:09:19,655
MATT: "Well, the next wyrm you decide to fell will
probably be the start of this war."

1102
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:23,043
TRAVIS: Can we ask, why would it bring
retaliation? How would they know it was us?

1103
01:09:23,043 --> 01:09:27,138
TALIESIN: We did sign the card.

1104
01:09:27,138 --> 01:09:28,299
MARISHA: We left our names.

1105
01:09:28,299 --> 01:09:29,619
LAURA: Maybe the next one we can sign as somebody
else.

1106
01:09:29,619 --> 01:09:30,892
TRAVIS: What if we don't sign it?

1107
01:09:30,892 --> 01:09:35,502
LIAM: Even if we don't, they probably are going to
get much more vindictive overall.

1108
01:09:35,502 --> 01:09:39,797
MARISHA: And just as much as we can scry on them,
they can scry on us. I'm sure they've been

1109
01:09:39,797 --> 01:09:40,989
watching us.

1110
01:09:40,989 --> 01:09:43,898
TALIESIN: I don't think they know where we are. I
think they know when we travel, I just don't think

1111
01:09:43,898 --> 01:09:45,117
they know where we are.

1112
01:09:45,117 --> 01:09:47,103
MATT: "Have any of the living ones seen you?"

1113
01:09:47,103 --> 01:09:48,532
LAURA: Have any what?

1114
01:09:48,532 --> 01:09:51,046
MATT: "Have any of the living ones seen you and
know you for who you are?"

1115
01:09:51,046 --> 01:09:54,845
TRAVIS: When we killed the first one, there were a
bunch of jewels in the wall and we saw a bunch of

1116
01:09:54,845 --> 01:09:56,072
eyeballs.

1117
01:09:56,072 --> 01:09:57,779
TALIESIN: He did not know our name, but he has
seen us.

1118
01:09:57,779 --> 01:10:00,525
LAURA: Raishan saw us, the white one saw us, all
of them saw us.

1119
01:10:00,525 --> 01:10:02,490
MATT: "Then it is very possible."

1120
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:07,517
SAM: Wait a second, you just said no one knew we
were here, none of them knew we were here.

1121
01:10:07,517 --> 01:10:08,627
TALIESIN: Here.

1122
01:10:08,627 --> 01:10:11,956
SAM: They just attacked here. And we just got back
here.

1123
01:10:11,956 --> 01:10:18,691
LAURA: Gilmore was scrying on them. It took three
days for him to get here. That's how he knew.

1124
01:10:18,691 --> 01:10:24,890
SAM: Because Gilmore was scrying on them. Got it.
Not because we have a leak.

1125
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:27,958
TALIESIN: We probably do. We should assume we have
a leak.

1126
01:10:27,958 --> 01:10:31,574
SAM: I'm going to blame Shaun.

1127
01:10:31,657 --> 01:10:34,580
TALIESIN: Is he Shaun now?

1128
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:37,924
MATT: "You're more than welcome to."

1129
01:10:37,924 --> 01:10:40,519
SAM: Sorry! (chuckles)

1130
01:10:40,519 --> 01:10:43,199
MATT: He's sitting down, wiping his brow with this
really fine scarf.

1131
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:52,096
MARISHA: Judging based on what happened in Emon,
we know that they have an insider, we just don't

1132
01:10:52,096 --> 01:10:53,469
know who yet.

1133
01:10:53,469 --> 01:10:54,749
SAM: They do? We know this?

1134
01:10:54,749 --> 01:10:57,531
TALIESIN: I would assume that there's nothing we
say that they don't know at this point.

1135
01:10:57,531 --> 01:10:59,471
LAURA: They struck during a political--

1136
01:10:59,471 --> 01:11:00,922
MARISHA: During a council meeting.

1137
01:11:00,922 --> 01:11:03,135
LAURA: Somebody has to be telling them things.

1138
01:11:03,135 --> 01:11:06,637
MARISHA: Someone probably very high up.

1139
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:09,694
LAURA: It could be Raishan taking the form of a
human again, for all we know.

1140
01:11:09,694 --> 01:11:12,472
SAM: Who was there and lived? Besides us?

1141
01:11:12,472 --> 01:11:16,607
MATT: Jarett catches up, by the way. (panting) "Is
everyone all right?"

1142
01:11:16,607 --> 01:11:21,544
LAURA: Yes. How are the citizens? Did you get
everyone in there?

1143
01:11:21,544 --> 01:11:26,670
MATT: "Everyone seems to be safe and accounted
for. There was a lot of fear, of course, but

1144
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:31,646
"elation, whatever you did." And he looks at you
and looks at Shaun. "Whatever you did, keep doing

1145
01:11:31,646 --> 01:11:32,854
"it, please."

1146
01:11:32,854 --> 01:11:35,296
TRAVIS: I insight check Jarett.

1147
01:11:35,296 --> 01:11:36,742
MATT: Make an insight check.

1148
01:11:36,742 --> 01:11:40,649
TRAVIS: Seven.

1149
01:11:40,649 --> 01:11:43,997
MATT: It's hard to read that fella. Slippery.

1150
01:11:43,997 --> 01:11:47,959
LIAM: Can I do an insight check on Asum?

1151
01:11:48,036 --> 01:11:49,333
MATT: You may.

1152
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:53,391
LAURA: What are you doing?

1153
01:11:53,391 --> 01:11:55,515
SAM: Ooh, that was a Luck.

1154
01:11:55,515 --> 01:11:57,012
LIAM: First one was good anyway.

1155
01:11:57,012 --> 01:12:00,717
LAURA: Oh, you're just hoping? First one was
really good.

1156
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:03,265
LIAM: Damn. I can choose whichever one I want.
21.

1157
01:12:03,265 --> 01:12:04,493
MATT: 21.

1158
01:12:04,493 --> 01:12:09,617
LAURA: About Jarett?! You're insighting Jarett?

1159
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:12,190
SAM: Seeker Asum.

1160
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:16,131
TALIESIN: Perhaps we should not have... assumed.

1161
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:19,334
MARISHA: Hey, Travis! How is it you're on this
side of the table?

1162
01:12:19,409 --> 01:12:22,090
TRAVIS: Well I was looking for a Loot Crate. Have
you guys seen any Loot Crates?

1163
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:25,988
SAM: Oh! Well I've got some of the great swag that
you can get in a Loot Crate. Why this shirt came

1164
01:12:25,988 --> 01:12:27,445
in one last week.

1165
01:12:27,445 --> 01:12:29,412
TRAVIS: That's incredible! How do I get one of
those?

1166
01:12:29,412 --> 01:12:35,423
SAM: You go to LootCrate.com/CriticalRole to
see your selection and then if you sign up, you

1167
01:12:35,493 --> 01:12:40,331
get three dollars off the first month, which is a
really good deal!

1168
01:12:40,331 --> 01:12:45,440
TALIESIN: Ironically when we played the game at
home this is exactly what we'd do.

1169
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,491
MATT: Totally.

1170
01:12:47,491 --> 01:12:50,303
LIAM: Sam who are you talking to? You're facing a
potted plant.

1171
01:12:50,303 --> 01:12:57,791
SAM: I'm talking to Seeker Asum! He's a big
fanboy.

1172
01:12:57,791 --> 01:13:07,943
MATT: Gilmore stands up and catches the edge of
Vax's shoulder.

1173
01:13:07,943 --> 01:13:10,293
LIAM: Hey.

1174
01:13:10,293 --> 01:13:13,547
MATT: "All right, so, what's your plan? What's the
next order of business?"

1175
01:13:13,547 --> 01:13:15,478
LAURA: Get you a drink, I think.

1176
01:13:15,478 --> 01:13:16,830
MATT: "A drink would be great."

1177
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:18,360
TALIESIN: I think we talk and drink.

1178
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:23,244
LAURA: Yes. We need to talk about barricading
underground. Making it more secure.

1179
01:13:23,244 --> 01:13:26,251
MATT: "Come. I can definitely use that right
now."

1180
01:13:26,251 --> 01:13:33,200
You guys are led into the nearest open-- it
looks to be an unused tavern, but there are

1181
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:38,305
drinks, ale and things that are at the ready.
There isn't much commerce currently happening in

1182
01:13:38,305 --> 01:13:41,901
the city, since right now everything's in survival
mode, so there's no exchange of money, you guys

1183
01:13:41,901 --> 01:13:47,951
are presented with drinks. The lanterns are lit on
the inside from other villagers that are just

1184
01:13:47,951 --> 01:13:53,147
happy to help. And the central table is set where
you all sit around and quietly have a few sips.

1185
01:13:53,147 --> 01:13:56,779
LIAM: While everyone's sitting, can I just pull
him over to a corner for a second?

1186
01:13:56,779 --> 01:13:57,939
MATT: Yeah.

1187
01:13:57,939 --> 01:13:59,722
LIAM: How are you doing, personally?

1188
01:13:59,722 --> 01:14:01,045
MATT: "Me?"

1189
01:14:01,045 --> 01:14:01,727
LIAM: Yeah.

1190
01:14:01,727 --> 01:14:04,656
MATT: "Wondrous! I'm doing great! (chuckles) I'm
exhausted."

1191
01:14:04,656 --> 01:14:07,382
LIAM: Shaun, I--

1192
01:14:07,382 --> 01:14:08,757
MATT: "I'll be fine."

1193
01:14:08,757 --> 01:14:09,649
LIAM: You sure?

1194
01:14:09,649 --> 01:14:10,646
MATT: "Yes, I'm fine."

1195
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:11,762
LIAM: All right.

1196
01:14:11,762 --> 01:14:17,259
MATT: "It's been a long time since I put my energy
and talents towards anything beyond making shiny

1197
01:14:17,259 --> 01:14:21,799
"things. Feels nice to be helping others."

1198
01:14:21,799 --> 01:14:23,529
LIAM: Well, I feel we're seeing your true
talents.

1199
01:14:23,529 --> 01:14:30,419
MATT: "I'm at my wits' end with these. Do you want
to see true talents? You should ask Allura to show

1200
01:14:30,419 --> 01:14:32,090
"you what she's capable of when she gets back."

1201
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:34,008
LIAM: She is pretty nifty.

1202
01:14:34,008 --> 01:14:37,713
MATT: (sighs heavily)

1203
01:14:37,713 --> 01:14:39,326
LIAM: Well, come on, come and have a drink.

1204
01:14:39,326 --> 01:14:43,121
MATT: And he like leans on you a bit and you both
make it back to the table. The rest of you--

1205
01:14:43,121 --> 01:14:50,649
SAM: This booze is okay, but Grog, I could really
use the finest wine I've ever had.

1206
01:14:50,649 --> 01:14:52,437
TRAVIS: Oh shit, hold on.

1207
01:14:52,437 --> 01:14:55,275
LAURA: We've got some fancy-ass bottles.

1208
01:14:55,275 --> 01:14:59,644
TRAVIS: I reach into the bag of holding and I grab
five expensive-ass bottles of wine.

1209
01:14:59,644 --> 01:15:00,826
LIAM: Holla!

1210
01:15:00,826 --> 01:15:02,821
MARISHA: Scanlan and I will share one.

1211
01:15:02,821 --> 01:15:04,250
SAM: Good idea.

1212
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:05,260
LAURA: Just one bottle between the two of you?

1213
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:07,932
SAM: We don't weigh very much.

1214
01:15:07,932 --> 01:15:09,134
MARISHA: No.

1215
01:15:09,134 --> 01:15:12,939
TALIESIN: I'm involved in this. This is exciting.

1216
01:15:12,939 --> 01:15:18,515
MATT: You guys scatter the wine amongst your
glasses. Drinks are had as you begin to discuss

1217
01:15:18,515 --> 01:15:19,627
the plan.

1218
01:15:19,627 --> 01:15:23,919
TALIESIN: Pour one for the landlord as well. He's
letting us drink our wine in his room.

1219
01:15:23,919 --> 01:15:33,210
MATT: Asum leans in. "All right. So. Vestiges.
Defenses. Allies, what's the next plan?

1220
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:34,299
"What's the next--"

1221
01:15:34,299 --> 01:15:40,568
TRAVIS: Well, I've a question. If I were to call
somewhere a City of Brass, where would you think

1222
01:15:40,568 --> 01:15:41,724
that would be?

1223
01:15:41,724 --> 01:15:56,735
MATT: Asum goes, "There are cities that use brass
in parts of construction in Wildemount, that's as far--"

1224
01:15:56,735 --> 01:16:02,904
Gilmore leans forward and goes, "No, that's
in the Elemental Plane of Fire. That's a

1225
01:16:02,904 --> 01:16:04,555
"dangerous, terrible place that you should never
go."

1226
01:16:04,555 --> 01:16:06,177
TRAVIS: We were already there once, actually.

1227
01:16:06,177 --> 01:16:10,508
TALIESIN: Terrible dangerous places you should
never go are practically our middle name.

1228
01:16:10,508 --> 01:16:13,641
LAURA: We saw Thordak there, actually.

1229
01:16:13,641 --> 01:16:15,180
MATT: "Oh! Even more of a reason not to go!"

1230
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:19,627
MARISHA: Well, he's here now, so Fire Plane's
probably safer!

1231
01:16:19,627 --> 01:16:21,702
TALIESIN: She's got a very fair point.

1232
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:23,879
LAURA: Why do you ask, Grog?

1233
01:16:23,879 --> 01:16:29,727
TRAVIS: Well, look, the Plate of the Dawnmartyr is
in a City of Brass, but I don't know where that is.

1234
01:16:29,727 --> 01:16:32,096
LAURA: I bet that sounds something Pike would
like.

1235
01:16:32,096 --> 01:16:34,979
TRAVIS: Draconia is in Wildemount?

1236
01:16:34,979 --> 01:16:36,649
MATT: "Draconia is in Wildemount, yes."

1237
01:16:36,649 --> 01:16:38,959
TRAVIS: Right. And so is the big white fuck,
right?

1238
01:16:38,959 --> 01:16:42,698
TALIESIN: Yes. Are any of the Vestiges in
Wildemount?

1239
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:44,714
TRAVIS: The City of Brass?

1240
01:16:44,714 --> 01:16:48,209
MATT: "Whereabouts are the Vestiges?"

1241
01:16:48,209 --> 01:16:51,519
LIAM: One at the bottom of the sea.

1242
01:16:51,519 --> 01:16:52,548
LAURA: One is in Marquet?

1243
01:16:52,548 --> 01:16:55,550
MARISHA: The City of Brass is in the Plane of
Fire. We've covered that.

1244
01:16:55,550 --> 01:16:58,818
SAM: It's not in Draconia? It's in the Plane of
Fire?

1245
01:16:58,818 --> 01:17:01,984
MARISHA: The city is in the Plane of Fire.

1246
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:03,527
SAM: Correct. Where's Ank'Harel?

1247
01:17:03,527 --> 01:17:09,872
MARISHA: Ank'Harel is on the continent of-- what's
it's called?

1248
01:17:09,872 --> 01:17:16,828
MATT: Gilmore chuckles to himself, "Ank'Harel.
It's been awhile." And looks at--

1249
01:17:16,828 --> 01:17:19,108
MARISHA: What's the continent? I suddenly blanked
on it. You just said it.

1250
01:17:19,108 --> 01:17:20,048
MATT: Marquet.

1251
01:17:20,048 --> 01:17:21,757
MARISHA: Marquet. It's on the continent of
Marquet.

1252
01:17:21,757 --> 01:17:29,502
MATT: Ank'Harel is also where Jarett is from,
which is where you first heard. Gilmore smiles.

1253
01:17:29,502 --> 01:17:32,913
"It's where I grew up, or nearabouts, at least."

1254
01:17:32,913 --> 01:17:34,713
SAM: Where you grew up, Gilmore?

1255
01:17:34,713 --> 01:17:36,642
MATT: "Well, not in the city, a little ways out a
bit."

1256
01:17:36,642 --> 01:17:38,027
SAM: You're Marquatian?

1257
01:17:38,027 --> 01:17:43,022
MATT: "Originally, yes, but I've been living here
most of my life. Soon as I had the opportunity to

1258
01:17:43,022 --> 01:17:50,315
"leave-- It's a free plane here in Tal'Dorei and
all the shops I can muster... until they all got

1259
01:17:50,315 --> 01:17:51,543
"destroyed."

1260
01:17:51,543 --> 01:17:52,720
LAURA: Good times.

1261
01:17:52,720 --> 01:18:00,644
MATT: "It's fine. I'd made the bottom floors too
small anyway. More space. Next time."

1262
01:18:00,644 --> 01:18:02,477
LIAM: You ever want to revisit home?

1263
01:18:02,477 --> 01:18:11,155
MATT: "Maybe. Nah. I need to stay here and
maintain this."

1264
01:18:11,155 --> 01:18:13,265
LAURA: Yes you do. If you don't mind.

1265
01:18:13,265 --> 01:18:19,058
SAM: What about the endless maze of the Abyss?
That's another place that we're supposed to go.

1266
01:18:19,058 --> 01:18:20,995
MARISHA: Also another plane of existence.

1267
01:18:20,995 --> 01:18:28,068
MATT: "I don't know much about the Abyss, but I
know that it's probably the worst place ever."

1268
01:18:28,068 --> 01:18:29,571
LAURA: Abyssal. That's where demons come from.

1269
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:30,964
TRAVIS: Worse than the Fire Plane?

1270
01:18:30,964 --> 01:18:32,067
MATT: "That's correct."

1271
01:18:32,067 --> 01:18:33,207
LAURA: That's the thing that killed Pike.

1272
01:18:33,207 --> 01:18:36,268
TRAVIS: Wait, isn't that where the rakshasa's
going to be?

1273
01:18:36,268 --> 01:18:37,845
MARISHA: That's in the Nine Hells.

1274
01:18:37,845 --> 01:18:39,057
LIAM: He's a devil.

1275
01:18:39,057 --> 01:18:41,136
TALIESIN: Ironically is somewhere else entirely.

1276
01:18:41,136 --> 01:18:50,945
LIAM: And I think we can table Meowmix for a
little bit. Somebody told us it takes a while.

1277
01:18:50,945 --> 01:18:52,859
LAURA: Months and months.

1278
01:18:52,859 --> 01:18:55,477
MARISHA: Months but we also don't want to wait
until--

1279
01:18:55,477 --> 01:18:56,400
LIAM: Not forever.

1280
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,775
TRAVIS: Who's got a map?

1281
01:18:57,775 --> 01:19:00,829
SAM: I've got a map.

1282
01:19:00,829 --> 01:19:03,750
TRAVIS: Where's the Ozmit Sea?

1283
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:07,808
TALIESIN: Before we even think of this, we should
see what we're-- I don't think we're going to

1284
01:19:07,808 --> 01:19:14,161
collect all of the Vestiges. We should see what
other Vestiges we think are going to be helpful.

1285
01:19:14,161 --> 01:19:15,868
SAM: It's like the Pacific Ocean.

1286
01:19:15,868 --> 01:19:18,897
TRAVIS: Which direction is it? Towards Draconia?

1287
01:19:18,897 --> 01:19:22,967
SAM: No. Draconia's across the Atlantic Ocean in
France.

1288
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:31,232
MARISHA: But the Ozmit Sea is where the Water
Ashari reside. And I have to go there anyway. It's

1289
01:19:31,232 --> 01:19:34,382
also where Pike is very familiar. I'm pretty sure
that's the sea that she sailed?

1290
01:19:34,382 --> 01:19:37,751
LIAM: And the Vestige there is the staff?

1291
01:19:37,751 --> 01:19:38,879
LAURA: Whisper, right?

1292
01:19:38,879 --> 01:19:39,883
SAM: Whisper, the blade.

1293
01:19:39,883 --> 01:19:40,720
MARISHA: Whisper, the blade.

1294
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:45,834
TRAVIS: Well, look, hey, so I have an idea, right.
Someone mentioned that the white dragon is very

1295
01:19:45,834 --> 01:19:51,458
vain and very savage. He's got like all those
wyverns around him. That's a little bit of a bitch

1296
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:58,234
for us. We're usually good one dragon on all of
us. You got a whole gang, worse for us. So what

1297
01:19:58,234 --> 01:20:07,455
about if we played to his vanity, and maybe sent
him knocking on one of his Conclave brother's

1298
01:20:07,455 --> 01:20:11,340
doors. Maybe start a little beef that maybe's not
there.

1299
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,784
SAM: How do we do that?

1300
01:20:13,838 --> 01:20:17,103
TRAVIS: I don't know, the idea just popped up. I'm
looking for your help and shit.

1301
01:20:17,103 --> 01:20:24,244
LIAM: He's a big picture man. Here's the detail
fellow.

1302
01:20:24,244 --> 01:20:25,992
TRAVIS: You know how tired I am right now?

1303
01:20:25,992 --> 01:20:27,220
LAURA: We're so tired.

1304
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:30,577
TALIESIN: I think that we've been thinking about
this the wrong way. I think that we've been

1305
01:20:30,577 --> 01:20:35,518
treating this as a battle. And we have to start
treating this like a war, which is a very

1306
01:20:35,518 --> 01:20:37,059
different creature.

1307
01:20:37,059 --> 01:20:38,608
SAM: Are we guerrillas?

1308
01:20:38,608 --> 01:20:42,191
TALIESIN: We are absolutely not.

1309
01:20:42,191 --> 01:20:43,504
LIAM: Beret.

1310
01:20:43,504 --> 01:20:44,612
TRAVIS: Wolverines!

1311
01:20:44,612 --> 01:20:52,685
TALIESIN: We need to reinforce this city not as a
final stand, but as a place where there might be

1312
01:20:52,685 --> 01:20:58,850
survivors. Because if they come here, there's no
battle to be fought. It's just a loss.

1313
01:20:58,850 --> 01:21:00,103
LAURA: We need to take it--

1314
01:21:00,103 --> 01:21:01,113
MARISHA: Elsewhere.

1315
01:21:01,113 --> 01:21:07,880
MATT: At this point Jarett steps out from back of
the room and says, "The more time that goes by,

1316
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:14,792
"the more chance there is that the battle, the war,
will be fought here. On our turf. The faster we

1317
01:21:14,792 --> 01:21:21,433
"move, the better chance we have of bringing it to
theirs, so let us not dilly-dally."

1318
01:21:21,433 --> 01:21:28,695
MARISHA: You mentioned about having our own mole
at one point. Our own inside man.

1319
01:21:28,695 --> 01:21:29,974
TRAVIS: Yeah. Scanlan.

1320
01:21:29,974 --> 01:21:35,667
SAM: I'm not going to volunteer myself as a slave
to the dragon.

1321
01:21:35,667 --> 01:21:38,642
TRAVIS: Keep thinking about it.

1322
01:21:38,642 --> 01:21:40,385
LIAM: You are a sexy dinosaur.

1323
01:21:40,385 --> 01:21:45,152
SAM: I'm considering it.

1324
01:21:45,152 --> 01:21:47,953
TRAVIS: You'll be the Hercules Mulligan of Vox
Machina.

1325
01:21:47,953 --> 01:21:49,569
ALL: Hercules Mulligan!

1326
01:21:49,569 --> 01:21:57,357
TALIESIN: I would like to talk to some of the
magic users about installing some sort of-- or

1327
01:21:57,357 --> 01:22:07,303
perhaps helping me install a non-magical dragon
raid signal so that the population knows to be

1328
01:22:07,303 --> 01:22:14,722
quiet, and knows to quietly go underground. In the
event of the next fly-by.

1329
01:22:14,722 --> 01:22:18,656
MATT: They all look at each other and Gilmore
nods. "That's actually, I wouldn't say

1330
01:22:18,656 --> 01:22:22,132
"rudimentary, but it's definitely within my skill
set."

1331
01:22:22,132 --> 01:22:25,325
TALIESIN: Would triggering it possibly alert them
to our existence? Does it make holding up the

1332
01:22:25,325 --> 01:22:26,547
shield--

1333
01:22:26,547 --> 01:22:28,967
MATT: "Not if I can maintain it underneath the
barrier."

1334
01:22:28,967 --> 01:22:31,722
SAM: Does the barrier block sound and visuals?

1335
01:22:31,722 --> 01:22:33,341
MATT: "It should."

1336
01:22:33,341 --> 01:22:38,801
SAM: And is there any way that we can help you
make this barrier more permanent and stronger?

1337
01:22:38,801 --> 01:22:43,157
MATT: "I don't know. This was crafted for this
reason. This isn't a long standing existing

1338
01:22:43,157 --> 01:22:49,091
"incantation. This was crafted through the minds of
Drake Thunderbrand and Allura and myself and

1339
01:22:49,091 --> 01:22:55,334
"Pike's aid. This is a new magic, it's
experimental, and to be perfectly honest, I'm very

1340
01:22:55,334 --> 01:22:57,535
"glad it succeeded because I was--"

1341
01:22:57,535 --> 01:22:59,110
LAURA: Just guessing?

1342
01:22:59,110 --> 01:23:00,870
MATT: "Essentially."

1343
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:07,243
LIAM: Also, Gilmore, as a sidebar, what about that
black ball beneath the city? Has anything been

1344
01:23:07,243 --> 01:23:08,735
learned of it?

1345
01:23:08,735 --> 01:23:10,523
MATT: "We've been a bit distracted."

1346
01:23:10,523 --> 01:23:11,779
LIAM: That's what I thought.

1347
01:23:11,779 --> 01:23:14,779
TALIESIN: I would like to put it to use.

1348
01:23:14,779 --> 01:23:16,031
LAURA: Wait, what?

1349
01:23:16,031 --> 01:23:17,129
TALIESIN: We're at war.

1350
01:23:17,129 --> 01:23:20,404
LAURA: We can't move it.

1351
01:23:20,404 --> 01:23:21,854
TALIESIN: We're not going to move it.

1352
01:23:21,854 --> 01:23:23,956
SAM: We're going inside it.

1353
01:23:23,956 --> 01:23:30,497
TALIESIN: I want to put the private council table
in the room with it.

1354
01:23:30,497 --> 01:23:32,443
SAM: In the room where it happens?

1355
01:23:32,443 --> 01:23:34,933
LAURA: So they can't scry into the room, it
cancels all magic.

1356
01:23:34,933 --> 01:23:40,883
TALIESIN: So no glamor will survive, no magic will
survive, no trick can be allowed.

1357
01:23:40,883 --> 01:23:45,506
MATT: "I love your mind, Percy. Have I told you
that? I love your mind. I love it."

1358
01:23:45,506 --> 01:23:48,750
TALIESIN: That's probably a bad sign, but thank
you.

1359
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:50,701
MATT: "We'll do that immediately. It sounds like a
grand plan."

1360
01:23:50,701 --> 01:23:53,868
Asum says, "Not a worry. We'll do that
immediately."

1361
01:23:53,868 --> 01:23:58,084
SAM: We'll just have to Seeker Asum that it
happened?

1362
01:23:58,084 --> 01:24:01,134
(laughter)

1363
01:24:01,134 --> 01:24:09,211
TALIESIN: We should move quickly. We should pick a
couple of Vestiges and move quickly, collect them.

1364
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:14,399
Start finding more allies, move quickly. But we
should not dally too long.

1365
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:20,114
MARISHA: And I agree, we might not be able to wait
to get them all before we start taking on dragons.

1366
01:24:20,114 --> 01:24:21,731
We might want to do both.

1367
01:24:21,731 --> 01:24:25,805
MATT: Jarett says, "If you're looking to go to the
Ozmit Sea, you'll probably need a ship of some

1368
01:24:25,805 --> 01:24:30,474
"kind. It's quite a far travel and that distance as
well and the docks on the west coast right now

1369
01:24:30,474 --> 01:24:32,536
"are, well they're locked down at Emon."

1370
01:24:32,536 --> 01:24:33,971
TALIESIN: Could Cabal's Ruin--

1371
01:24:33,971 --> 01:24:35,429
LAURA: How long is the travel to Marquet?

1372
01:24:35,429 --> 01:24:48,223
MATT: "Travel by boat, across the Ozmit, maybe
about a week, a week and a half. Skyship, maybe

1373
01:24:48,223 --> 01:24:49,361
"half as long."

1374
01:24:49,361 --> 01:24:50,845
SAM: Airship. Airship. Airship?!

1375
01:24:50,845 --> 01:24:58,951
MATT: Gilmore actually steps in and is like,
"Technically, I have a teleportation sigil outside

1376
01:24:58,951 --> 01:25:01,247
"the city. I could probably just get you there."

1377
01:25:01,247 --> 01:25:04,468
SAM: Wait, to go to where? Marquet?

1378
01:25:04,468 --> 01:25:07,495
LIAM: Walking is really good for the health
though.

1379
01:25:07,495 --> 01:25:10,043
MARISHA: And first level characters, which we are
not.

1380
01:25:10,043 --> 01:25:13,391
SAM: Hold on. Before we decide that Marquet is the
thing.

1381
01:25:13,391 --> 01:25:16,498
TALIESIN: It's Cabal's Ruin, correct? We're going
to search for Cabal's Ruin.

1382
01:25:16,498 --> 01:25:22,526
TRAVIS: Are we at all just forgetting the fact
that Draconia is lying in ruins?

1383
01:25:22,526 --> 01:25:25,154
TALIESIN: We don't have time.

1384
01:25:25,154 --> 01:25:30,377
LAURA: No, it's not about time. The dragon is
sitting on top of Draconia.

1385
01:25:30,377 --> 01:25:31,777
SAM: So we know where to find him to kill him.

1386
01:25:31,777 --> 01:25:35,960
LAURA: Unless we know how to take on that dragon,
we can't save anyone.

1387
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:37,625
SAM: wE've killed dragons before.

1388
01:25:37,625 --> 01:25:42,061
TALIESIN: I will feel better with one or two more
Vestiges in our pocket.

1389
01:25:42,061 --> 01:25:45,518
LIAM: By the skin of our teeth, Scanlan. By the
skin of its gut.

1390
01:25:45,518 --> 01:25:47,231
TALIESIN: We got lucky.

1391
01:25:47,231 --> 01:25:50,311
SAM: I like Grog's idea. Is there a way to explore
that any further?

1392
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:52,057
MARISHA: Pitting the dragons against each other?

1393
01:25:52,057 --> 01:25:53,116
SAM: Yes!

1394
01:25:53,116 --> 01:25:54,440
TALIESIN: I think it's a great idea worth
exploring.

1395
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:56,629
LIAM: Seeker Asum is on it. He said that he was
going to--

1396
01:25:56,629 --> 01:26:04,616
SAM: Seeker Asum is great, but we're the best in
the business. I wouldn't leave our plan A to

1397
01:26:04,616 --> 01:26:07,182
someone not us.

1398
01:26:07,182 --> 01:26:10,716
LAURA: Seeker Asum is telling people that this
city has been magicked away.

1399
01:26:10,716 --> 01:26:12,965
MATT: Asum is also still at the table.

1400
01:26:12,965 --> 01:26:14,424
MARISHA: Yeah, he's right there.

1401
01:26:14,424 --> 01:26:19,843
TALIESIN: We're drunk, we will talk about you 
in third person as much as we want.

1402
01:26:19,897 --> 01:26:23,093
LAURA: We're just reiterating the things that you
told us you were going to say.

1403
01:26:23,093 --> 01:26:24,462
MATT: "That's all right."

1404
01:26:24,462 --> 01:26:26,943
TALIESIN: We figured you would speak up if you had
issue.

1405
01:26:26,943 --> 01:26:29,116
LAURA: Plus it's really fun to say your name.

1406
01:26:29,116 --> 01:26:31,437
MATT: "Never heard it before, I assure you."

1407
01:26:31,437 --> 01:26:35,872
TRAVIS: How far away is Draconia from here? Travel
wise?

1408
01:26:35,872 --> 01:26:43,345
MATT: "Well, my usual travel to Wildemount is
across the northern channel here. I'd say you're

1409
01:26:43,345 --> 01:26:48,955
"looking at about two weeks of travel by ship
across the Lucidian Ocean."

1410
01:26:48,955 --> 01:26:55,502
MARISHA: Or we can always teleport. I can Tree
Stride. I can always Tree Stride.

1411
01:26:55,502 --> 01:26:57,352
SAM: Have you been to Draconia?

1412
01:26:57,352 --> 01:26:59,542
MARISHA: I can scry and look at a tree.

1413
01:26:59,542 --> 01:27:01,514
MATT: Tree Stride is a short distance. You mean
Transport via Plants.

1414
01:27:01,514 --> 01:27:09,470
MARISHA: Whatever. They all sound the same. I can
scry, look at a tree, and then we go through that tree.

1415
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:10,993
SAM: If there's any trees left.

1416
01:27:10,993 --> 01:27:12,435
LAURA: There's definitely at least--

1417
01:27:12,435 --> 01:27:14,540
MARISHA: I'm hoping there's a tree on that
continent.

1418
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:17,671
LIAM: Are we talking though about how scrying is a
little dangerous right now?

1419
01:27:17,671 --> 01:27:19,599
MARISHA: When you're scrying on dragon.

1420
01:27:19,599 --> 01:27:21,314
LAURA: When you're scrying on a tree.

1421
01:27:21,314 --> 01:27:24,111
MARISHA: Yeah, the tree doesn't know it's being
spied on.

1422
01:27:24,111 --> 01:27:28,485
TRAVIS: Doesn't Draconia have an army there? If
there are any survivors, anyone we can bring back

1423
01:27:28,485 --> 01:27:31,756
to Whitestone, shouldn't we be accumulating those
people?

1424
01:27:31,756 --> 01:27:36,677
TALIESIN: I think if there's a dragon sitting on
top of them, removing people from him is--

1425
01:27:36,677 --> 01:27:39,293
TRAVIS: We're sneaky, we're so sneaky!

1426
01:27:39,293 --> 01:27:40,647
LAURA: Are we sneaky?

1427
01:27:40,647 --> 01:27:42,046
TRAVIS: Yeah! Pike's not even here.

1428
01:27:42,046 --> 01:27:48,952
LAURA: You have your memories of the Feywild, do
you remember sloshing around in that black sludge?

1429
01:27:48,952 --> 01:27:50,818
Very loudly?

1430
01:27:50,818 --> 01:27:55,081
MARISHA: Do you remember us walking into the town
center to kill Kevdak? That wasn't sneaky.

1431
01:27:55,081 --> 01:27:58,468
TRAVIS: No, no that was personal.

1432
01:27:58,468 --> 01:28:00,892
TALIESIN: Grog, I think you're thinking of a
battle we can win, as opposed to a war we're

1433
01:28:00,892 --> 01:28:01,913
losing.

1434
01:28:01,913 --> 01:28:06,096
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, look I'm not trying to pick a
fight with a dragon, I'm just going to make sure

1435
01:28:06,096 --> 01:28:09,956
that dragonborn are there and we can help them.

1436
01:28:09,956 --> 01:28:12,523
TALIESIN: We can help them by killing the dragon.

1437
01:28:12,523 --> 01:28:14,075
LIAM: Yes.

1438
01:28:14,075 --> 01:28:15,228
TRAVIS: Wow.

1439
01:28:15,228 --> 01:28:16,666
TALIESIN: Vax is agreeing with me.

1440
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:21,400
MATT: "Actually that's pretty sound. If you manage
to defeat the dragon there, you'll probably gather

1441
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:25,411
"the survivors and have them join the cause against
Emon. If you have means of transporting them.

1442
01:28:25,411 --> 01:28:27,491
"Remember, once a dragon is down, it's--"

1443
01:28:27,491 --> 01:28:29,226
LAURA: It's on.

1444
01:28:29,226 --> 01:28:30,234
MATT: "It's on."

1445
01:28:30,234 --> 01:28:32,626
SAM: Grog is the best thinker.

1446
01:28:32,626 --> 01:28:38,309
MARISHA: Yeah. We pull the trigger on one, we pull
the trigger on all of them.

1447
01:28:38,309 --> 01:28:40,302
LAURA: I can't believe if we fight one that means
we have to fight--

1448
01:28:40,302 --> 01:28:43,994
TRAVIS: Well, listen. Again, I'm not trying to
kill the white dragon.

1449
01:28:43,994 --> 01:28:46,497
TALIESIN: What is the white dragon going to do--

1450
01:28:46,497 --> 01:28:49,657
TRAVIS: I want him to go pick a fight with the
other dragons.

1451
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:51,379
LAURA: How are we going to do that, though?

1452
01:28:51,379 --> 01:28:55,481
LIAM: We're working on that as a side venture.
What are we going to do there to make that

1453
01:28:55,536 --> 01:28:56,390
happen?

1454
01:28:56,390 --> 01:28:58,111
MARISHA: We can't really stroll up to it and be
like--

1455
01:28:58,111 --> 01:29:04,632
TRAVIS: You guys don't know how to pick a fight?
You honestly can't brainstorm one way to pick a fight?

1456
01:29:04,632 --> 01:29:09,602
MARISHA: We are very good at picking fights. It's
getting the dragons to pick fights on others.

1457
01:29:09,602 --> 01:29:12,994
SAM: We can probably plan a ruse.

1458
01:29:12,994 --> 01:29:14,511
LAURA: Oh, and how would you do it, Grog?

1459
01:29:14,511 --> 01:29:24,829
TRAVIS: I would talk mad shit to the white dragon
on behalf of the green dragon. I would rep the

1460
01:29:24,829 --> 01:29:26,126
green dragon.

1461
01:29:26,126 --> 01:29:28,574
LAURA: Oh my god, Grog, he will never see through
that! That's brilliant.

1462
01:29:28,574 --> 01:29:33,085
LIAM: You are really strong. That's the end of it,
I have nothing else to say.

1463
01:29:33,085 --> 01:29:39,489
TRAVIS: I'm just saying, I feel like an
opportunity's being wasted here.

1464
01:29:39,489 --> 01:29:42,094
TALIESIN: I think an opportunity's being tabled
briefly.

1465
01:29:42,094 --> 01:29:43,820
MARISHA: We've got to think about it.

1466
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:47,486
TALIESIN: I don't think this is nearly as time
sensitive.

1467
01:29:47,486 --> 01:29:49,328
TRAVIS: Fine. Someone else do the thinking.

1468
01:29:49,328 --> 01:29:54,845
MARISHA: Breeding hostility between the two is
something that could take weeks, which we don't have.

1469
01:29:54,845 --> 01:29:59,007
TALIESIN: Well, we could start it. It's also
something other people can do while we do other things.

1470
01:29:59,007 --> 01:30:01,855
LIAM: Yes. Delegate.

1471
01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:05,922
MARISHA: But how? It literally involves going to
one dragon and saying: Hey, did you hear what that

1472
01:30:05,922 --> 01:30:08,044
other dragon said about you? That's all I got.

1473
01:30:08,044 --> 01:30:16,009
TALIESIN: Well, there are other ways to do it. In
traditional warfare, you can do things like cause

1474
01:30:16,009 --> 01:30:22,396
damage to the property of one dragon and leave
scant evidence that the other dragon, or one of

1475
01:30:22,396 --> 01:30:29,754
the dragon's people, was somehow responsible. Have
a raiding, somehow get wyverns to raid near--

1476
01:30:29,754 --> 01:30:32,805
MARISHA: Wait, hang on. That first thing you
said.

1477
01:30:32,805 --> 01:30:34,993
TALIESIN: Yes. It's the easiest level.

1478
01:30:34,993 --> 01:30:40,714
MARISHA: I think I might have an idea. Okay, we
know the white dragon is vain.

1479
01:30:40,714 --> 01:30:42,841
LAURA: Right? We know that?

1480
01:30:42,841 --> 01:30:49,565
MATT: All dragons to an extent are vain. It's part
of the nature of the chromatics.

1481
01:30:49,565 --> 01:30:51,406
SAM: White dragon loves the thrill of the hunt.

1482
01:30:51,406 --> 01:30:56,842
MATT: The white dragon is the most comparably
primal. They're all in various stages of

1483
01:30:56,842 --> 01:31:01,089
hyperintelligence. The white dragon is the one
that's the most... beastlike.

1484
01:31:01,089 --> 01:31:07,394
TALIESIN: If the white dragon is a hunter, the
easiest way to incite damage is to sneak into the

1485
01:31:07,394 --> 01:31:12,811
city and start mauling and killing Draconians that
are left over, and just leaving bodies everywhere

1486
01:31:12,811 --> 01:31:14,624
that he wasn't responsible for.

1487
01:31:14,624 --> 01:31:18,409
MARISHA: What?!

1488
01:31:18,409 --> 01:31:20,996
TALIESIN: That is the sort of decisions we're
going to start having to make.

1489
01:31:20,996 --> 01:31:25,801
LAURA: What if somebody can Polymorph into a
little green dragon or something?

1490
01:31:25,801 --> 01:31:30,233
MARISHA: Yeah, you went to 11 there on let's start
continuing the genocide.

1491
01:31:30,233 --> 01:31:34,490
LAURA: Fuck shit up as a dragon and leave evidence
behind as a green dragon.

1492
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:37,791
SAM: I've seen the green dragon. Raishan?

1493
01:31:37,791 --> 01:31:39,301
MATT: You have seen the dragon.

1494
01:31:39,301 --> 01:31:40,355
SAM: How big?

1495
01:31:40,355 --> 01:31:45,699
MATT: Gargantuan. And you cannot Polymorph into
dragons. You can only transform into beasts.

1496
01:31:45,699 --> 01:31:47,188
SAM: I understand.

1497
01:31:47,188 --> 01:31:55,970
MATT: Fairly large, yeah. I'd say probably--
Raishan is the smallest of the dragons you saw,

1498
01:31:55,970 --> 01:32:01,906
but even at the smallest of them, is still a
good 30 feet to the shoulder.

1499
01:32:01,906 --> 01:32:03,781
SAM: I could do that.

1500
01:32:03,781 --> 01:32:06,757
LIAM: Gather all the papier-mâché you have in the
city.

1501
01:32:06,757 --> 01:32:10,853
SAM: I could do something pretty close to that.

1502
01:32:10,853 --> 01:32:13,629
TRAVIS: I bet you could do a lot of incredible
things.

1503
01:32:13,629 --> 01:32:16,571
SAM: Are you Tony Robbins?

1504
01:32:16,571 --> 01:32:21,700
(laughter)

1505
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:27,509
TALIESIN: I think this is a conversation that can
continue through Marquet. I don't think we're

1506
01:32:27,509 --> 01:32:29,350
going to come up with the best idea tonight.

1507
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:31,506
MARISHA: But we need to get something started.
Here's what we learned.

1508
01:32:31,506 --> 01:32:32,859
SAM: At dawn.

1509
01:32:32,859 --> 01:32:41,007
MARISHA: At dawn we drink some more. We learned
that Thordak is enslaving sculptors to build his

1510
01:32:41,007 --> 01:32:46,550
image all around Emon. What we have learned is it
seems that each of the dragons have picked a city,

1511
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:55,369
a domain. Maybe this domain was part of the
bargain to join Thordak's cause. Help me, you get

1512
01:32:55,369 --> 01:32:56,664
your own city.

1513
01:32:56,664 --> 01:32:58,619
TALIESIN: A reasonable and astute observation,
yes.

1514
01:32:58,619 --> 01:33:06,005
MARISHA: So I bet the white dragon would be real
pissed off if statues of Thordak started popping

1515
01:33:06,005 --> 01:33:07,817
up around Draconia.

1516
01:33:07,817 --> 01:33:09,210
LAURA: Or the green dragon.

1517
01:33:09,210 --> 01:33:10,630
MARISHA: Or the green dragon.

1518
01:33:10,630 --> 01:33:13,775
TRAVIS: Or maybe even statues where Umbrasyl's
nest was.

1519
01:33:13,775 --> 01:33:16,302
TALIESIN: Let's pick a dragon.

1520
01:33:16,302 --> 01:33:17,769
LAURA: Vorugal is the white dragon?

1521
01:33:17,769 --> 01:33:27,700
SAM: Raishan is the green. Here's the problem with
goading Vorugal the white to find and kill Raishan

1522
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:31,663
the green. No one knows where Raishan the green
is, including Vorugal.

1523
01:33:31,663 --> 01:33:33,397
LAURA: How do you know Vorugal doesn't know?

1524
01:33:33,397 --> 01:33:38,663
SAM: Because Raishan's the shapeshifter, and no
one knows where she is, including Gilmore, who's

1525
01:33:38,663 --> 01:33:40,744
been scrying for a week to try to find her.

1526
01:33:40,744 --> 01:33:43,173
LAURA: Yeah, but the white dragon might have some
way to communicate.

1527
01:33:43,173 --> 01:33:45,496
TRAVIS: Do we know how they communicate?

1528
01:33:45,496 --> 01:33:51,346
LIAM: Yes, we do. There were some baubles in a
wall in Krieg's secret cave.

1529
01:33:51,346 --> 01:33:54,727
LAURA: They have other balls, right?

1530
01:33:54,727 --> 01:34:01,234
TRAVIS: Gilmore, Asum, do either of you have a
theory on how they communicate?

1531
01:34:01,234 --> 01:34:10,843
MATT: Gilmore looks to Asum. "I have not been to
any of their bases. Asum, you've been watching Thordak."

1532
01:34:10,843 --> 01:34:20,200
He looks back. "Within his domain in the Cloudtop,
he has... apparently an overhead airplane."

1533
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:22,268
LAURA: It's very loud.

1534
01:34:22,268 --> 01:34:33,767
MATT: Trust me, it was strange. "He has a number
of various spies that are sworn to him that act as

1535
01:34:33,767 --> 01:34:41,157
"his network of information to and from the
Cloudtop and his throne of black glass and molten

1536
01:34:41,157 --> 01:34:51,907
"rock. He does have singular pillars placed around
that contain four orbs that he would speak into on

1537
01:34:51,907 --> 01:34:53,285
"occasion."

1538
01:34:53,285 --> 01:34:59,771
MARISHA: And didn't we see something similar in
Umbrasyl's and when we killed the blue?

1539
01:34:59,771 --> 01:35:01,850
LAURA: We saw orbs in Umbrasyl's?

1540
01:35:01,850 --> 01:35:05,573
MARISHA: Yeah, remember, it cracked and it was
like, I'm coming for you! And we were like, we

1541
01:35:05,573 --> 01:35:07,188
don't know what that means! And we ignored it.

1542
01:35:07,188 --> 01:35:08,342
LAURA: That was in Brimscythe's.

1543
01:35:08,342 --> 01:35:11,324
LIAM: Did we see that in the black?

1544
01:35:11,324 --> 01:35:13,858
TRAVIS: They were broken already.

1545
01:35:13,858 --> 01:35:15,628
MATT: Yeah. They were already shattered.

1546
01:35:15,628 --> 01:35:19,016
LAURA: He shattered them. Fuck.

1547
01:35:19,016 --> 01:35:20,694
SAM: Why did he shatter them?

1548
01:35:20,694 --> 01:35:24,899
LAURA: So that we wouldn't be able to scry on
anyone else. Or he was pissed!

1549
01:35:24,899 --> 01:35:26,858
SAM: He was pissed at the other dragons, maybe.

1550
01:35:26,858 --> 01:35:36,007
LIAM: But it's not safe to assume-- Asum, sorry--
that they're not in communication. We have to

1551
01:35:36,007 --> 01:35:39,665
assume that they are. I'm so sorry.

1552
01:35:39,665 --> 01:35:43,009
MATT: "It's all right. It's not like my childhood
friend Purvon."

1553
01:35:43,009 --> 01:35:47,367
(laughter)

1554
01:35:47,367 --> 01:35:53,865
TALIESIN: There is a thought. This is a very good
idea. You've got a very good idea.

1555
01:35:53,865 --> 01:35:55,714
SAM: What's the idea?

1556
01:35:55,714 --> 01:36:03,907
MARISHA: I said we start planting statues of
Thordak or Raishan in other dragons' territories.

1557
01:36:03,907 --> 01:36:10,582
Ultimately, though, what we need is we need
someone who knows the dragons' weaknesses. We need

1558
01:36:10,582 --> 01:36:12,514
to know what pushes their buttons.

1559
01:36:12,514 --> 01:36:15,021
SAM: We know what pushes their buttons.

1560
01:36:15,021 --> 01:36:19,714
TALIESIN: We need to know what pushes the reset
button. Why am I speaking in video game metaphor?

1561
01:36:19,714 --> 01:36:21,268
LIAM: What?

1562
01:36:21,268 --> 01:36:22,934
TALIESIN: Nothing. Drink.

1563
01:36:22,934 --> 01:36:29,127
SAM: We can throw up some statues and cause some
havoc, but if they have these orbs that

1564
01:36:29,127 --> 01:36:33,258
communicate with each other, then the white can
call Thordak and say: Hey, what's up with these

1565
01:36:33,258 --> 01:36:35,977
statues? And Thordak can say: No, it's not me.

1566
01:36:35,977 --> 01:36:46,758
TALIESIN: Not statues. Idols. Small images of the
white dragon for worship.

1567
01:36:46,758 --> 01:36:49,143
LIAM: You're gambling on jealousy.

1568
01:36:49,143 --> 01:36:57,052
TALIESIN: Start hiding them in places. If we start
seeding them, especially in Emon, as if he is

1569
01:36:57,052 --> 01:37:01,606
trying to get people to worship him in other
cities as well, silently, quietly underneath--

1570
01:37:01,606 --> 01:37:04,128
SAM: We'll make t-shirts that say Team Vorugal.

1571
01:37:04,128 --> 01:37:09,395
TALIESIN: We just have to make sure that we don't
use the stone from here.

1572
01:37:09,395 --> 01:37:13,830
MARISHA: Well, because we know that Thordak is
definitely vain.

1573
01:37:13,830 --> 01:37:19,089
TALIESIN: And this will piss him off. And if he
says what are you doing, I don't know anything

1574
01:37:19,089 --> 01:37:20,162
about this.

1575
01:37:20,162 --> 01:37:21,948
LAURA: Yeah, he would deny it. Of course he would
deny it.

1576
01:37:21,948 --> 01:37:29,245
MARISHA: And we're assuming-- sorry-- that they'll
ask instead of jumping to conclusions.

1577
01:37:29,245 --> 01:37:31,940
TALIESIN: I like it.

1578
01:37:31,940 --> 01:37:33,972
LAURA: Even if he jumps to conclusions, he would
be pissed.

1579
01:37:33,972 --> 01:37:36,211
SAM: But we know that Thordak is a total asshole--
Sorry.

1580
01:37:36,211 --> 01:37:42,388
(laughter)

1581
01:37:42,388 --> 01:37:46,776
SAM: So we know he'll be pissed off, more or
less.

1582
01:37:46,776 --> 01:37:49,866
MATT: His scarred eye twitches for a moment.

1583
01:37:49,866 --> 01:37:52,782
MARISHA: And we wonder why people hate us.

1584
01:37:52,782 --> 01:38:03,448
MATT: Asum leans into the conversation and goes,
"We have many crafters and artisans that are

1585
01:38:03,448 --> 01:38:08,149
"within the grasp of the Clasp as well, within
Emon. We can begin to have these made and

1586
01:38:08,149 --> 01:38:10,729
"scattered throughout the various offerings brought
to the center of the city."

1587
01:38:10,729 --> 01:38:12,904
TALIESIN: Little shrines, hidden in ruins.

1588
01:38:12,904 --> 01:38:14,418
MATT: "I like this."

1589
01:38:14,418 --> 01:38:17,112
MARISHA: Hashtag Team Vorugal.

1590
01:38:17,112 --> 01:38:22,877
MATT: "We can make this happen." You can make that
happen. Hashtag Team Vorugal.

1591
01:38:22,877 --> 01:38:32,050
TALIESIN: I still will admit that Cabal's Ruin is
one of the Vestiges I feel would be-- and not just

1592
01:38:32,050 --> 01:38:33,428
because I would like to use it.

1593
01:38:33,428 --> 01:38:43,256
MARISHA: Is Ank'harel and the Ozmit Sea in the
same area? Can we hit one on our way to the

1594
01:38:43,256 --> 01:38:44,136
other?

1595
01:38:44,136 --> 01:38:48,805
MATT: The Ozmit Sea is in between Tal'Dorei and--
from your perspective, it's Tal'Dorei and Marquet,

1596
01:38:48,805 --> 01:38:50,689
and the Ozmit Sea is what's in between.

1597
01:38:50,689 --> 01:38:52,235
TALIESIN: So we could do a triple.

1598
01:38:52,235 --> 01:38:56,074
MARISHA: We could do a triple. Because I have to
get to the Water Ashari at some point.

1599
01:38:56,074 --> 01:38:59,811
TALIESIN: And that's very important, because we
need them on our side.

1600
01:38:59,811 --> 01:39:01,801
SAM: Between what and what?

1601
01:39:01,801 --> 01:39:04,200
TALIESIN: Ozmit Sea, so it's over here.

1602
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:05,684
SAM: It's between what and who?

1603
01:39:05,684 --> 01:39:07,659
MATT: The Ozmit Sea is between Marquet and
Tal'Dorei.

1604
01:39:07,659 --> 01:39:09,084
SAM: Is this Tal'Dorei?

1605
01:39:09,084 --> 01:39:11,414
MARISHA: We're on Tal'Dorei.

1606
01:39:11,414 --> 01:39:16,263
SAM: So Marquet is Japan.

1607
01:39:16,263 --> 01:39:18,642
MATT: More Australia.

1608
01:39:18,642 --> 01:39:25,314
SAM: Got it. Is this world round? Can we go the
other way?

1609
01:39:25,314 --> 01:39:31,306
TALIESIN: Actually, this world is shaped like a
d20, so we're on the flat part at the five.

1610
01:39:31,306 --> 01:39:32,929
SAM: Can't go the other way?

1611
01:39:32,929 --> 01:39:35,969
MATT: You could eventually get there. It is
round.

1612
01:39:35,969 --> 01:39:45,981
LAURA: Would I know how fast dragons can actually
fly? If it's a two-week trip to get to Draconia

1613
01:39:45,981 --> 01:39:47,927
from where we are--

1614
01:39:47,927 --> 01:39:52,830
MATT: Two weeks via ship. Ocean ship.

1615
01:39:52,830 --> 01:39:55,596
LAURA: Okay. If they were flying, how fast could
they get there, potentially?

1616
01:39:55,596 --> 01:39:59,334
TRAVIS: I'm only saying, maybe it's empty, right?

1617
01:39:59,334 --> 01:40:03,247
MARISHA: What is?

1618
01:40:03,247 --> 01:40:05,014
TRAVIS: Draconia.

1619
01:40:05,014 --> 01:40:09,986
MATT: I'm going to make some mathematics here, if
you'll excuse me.

1620
01:40:09,986 --> 01:40:12,587
TRAVIS: I'm only saying, if they were just here--

1621
01:40:12,587 --> 01:40:16,053
SAM: But we could bamf there right now.

1622
01:40:16,053 --> 01:40:19,649
LAURA: Check it out and get out before they get
back.

1623
01:40:19,649 --> 01:40:22,490
TRAVIS: Get people out, do recon, whatever.

1624
01:40:22,490 --> 01:40:24,564
SAM and MARISHA: Plant some seeds.

1625
01:40:24,564 --> 01:40:31,653
LAURA: They've probably left a good amount of army
there to keep people under control. We'd have to

1626
01:40:31,653 --> 01:40:33,609
get in and out in a couple of hours.

1627
01:40:33,609 --> 01:40:35,116
SAM: And what would our mission be?

1628
01:40:35,116 --> 01:40:36,664
LIAM: Dump a couple of statues.

1629
01:40:36,664 --> 01:40:37,967
LAURA: We don't have them.

1630
01:40:37,967 --> 01:40:39,793
TALIESIN: Let other people do that.

1631
01:40:39,793 --> 01:40:46,299
SAM: Wait. What about, instead of dumping statues,
we find these orbs? We find his lair, we find his

1632
01:40:46,299 --> 01:40:54,385
orbs, and we call Thordak and we do a voice like:
Yo, Thordak! You're a dickhead! I'm going to come

1633
01:40:54,385 --> 01:40:58,810
kill you! Or we just smash them.

1634
01:40:58,810 --> 01:41:02,104
TALIESIN: I don't know why everyone's so excited
about the notion of pissing off the dragons to the

1635
01:41:02,104 --> 01:41:05,828
point at which they all come here, but it is a way
to go.

1636
01:41:05,828 --> 01:41:07,060
SAM: They don't know we're here.

1637
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:08,213
TALIESIN: They know we're here.

1638
01:41:08,213 --> 01:41:10,780
TRAVIS: I'm just pointing out an opportunity where
there is one.

1639
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:11,929
SAM: That's true.

1640
01:41:11,929 --> 01:41:13,282
MATT: A few days.

1641
01:41:13,282 --> 01:41:15,048
LAURA: It would take them a few days to get
there?

1642
01:41:15,048 --> 01:41:17,995
TRAVIS: A few days? We would have a whole fucking
day!

1643
01:41:17,995 --> 01:41:19,155
MARISHA: What time is it?

1644
01:41:19,155 --> 01:41:22,782
MATT: At this point in time, it's mid-afternoon,
evening.

1645
01:41:22,782 --> 01:41:25,616
SAM: We have to rest.

1646
01:41:25,616 --> 01:41:33,543
LIAM: Percival, even just for intelligence, even
if it was brief, even to see what is going on there.

1647
01:41:33,543 --> 01:41:39,747
TALIESIN: We have to make sure that we can get out
immediately, and we also have to agree that if

1648
01:41:39,747 --> 01:41:43,120
things start looking too iffy, we run.

1649
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:44,340
MARISHA: I have an idea.

1650
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:45,896
SAM: You have the best ideas.

1651
01:41:45,896 --> 01:41:46,777
MARISHA: Thank you.

1652
01:41:46,777 --> 01:41:47,900
SAM: Lay it on me.

1653
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:51,746
MARISHA: Can you Seeming us to all look like
lizard army members?

1654
01:41:51,746 --> 01:41:57,433
SAM: Tomorrow. And we'll look like us, except
vaguely like lizard people.

1655
01:41:57,433 --> 01:41:59,498
TRAVIS: Why not wyverns?

1656
01:41:59,498 --> 01:42:07,338
SAM: First of all, the lizard army, is that
different from wyverns? So they're just scaly

1657
01:42:07,338 --> 01:42:09,380
creepers. I can do that.

1658
01:42:09,380 --> 01:42:11,896
LAURA: Have you seen the lizard people?

1659
01:42:11,896 --> 01:42:13,700
SAM: No, but I'll see them when we get there.

1660
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:14,800
LAURA: Okay.

1661
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:19,197
MATT: You've come across a few of the lizardfolk.
They attacked you in Emon. They were on the

1662
01:42:19,197 --> 01:42:25,373
wyverns. They're humanoid. They're a little larger
than one of your half-elf companions or Percy.

1663
01:42:25,373 --> 01:42:29,256
MARISHA: We fought them on the airship, too,
right?

1664
01:42:29,256 --> 01:42:33,137
MATT: No, those were bandits. You fought wyverns.

1665
01:42:33,137 --> 01:42:36,052
SAM: We could be lizard people, for sure.

1666
01:42:36,052 --> 01:42:38,084
LAURA: Wait, what?

1667
01:42:38,084 --> 01:42:45,603
TALIESIN: We could look like lizard people, and it
would trick anybody who wasn't a dragon. And if

1668
01:42:45,603 --> 01:42:48,327
the dragon came, we would be fucked. That would be
the end. That would be game over.

1669
01:42:48,327 --> 01:42:53,702
SAM: (singing) We could be lizard people!

1670
01:42:53,702 --> 01:42:58,170
TALIESIN: I'm going to go on record as saying I do
not think this is the right move.

1671
01:42:58,170 --> 01:43:00,303
LIAM: What do you think is the right move?

1672
01:43:00,303 --> 01:43:04,359
SAM: He wants to go to Marquet to find some cloak
that may or may not help us in a week.

1673
01:43:04,359 --> 01:43:12,915
TALIESIN: Will help us. Getting three more
Vestiges, two more Vestiges, just a little bit

1674
01:43:12,915 --> 01:43:15,981
more power before starting to play chess again.

1675
01:43:15,981 --> 01:43:21,711
LAURA: Really the only point of going there
would be reconnaissance. That's it. No fighting.

1676
01:43:21,711 --> 01:43:24,083
TRAVIS: When else are we going to know for sure?

1677
01:43:24,083 --> 01:43:29,196
TALIESIN: There's an ancient dwarven saying, and
I'm trying to remember where I heard it, but it

1678
01:43:29,196 --> 01:43:35,652
goes somewhere along the lines of, it's never a
three-hour tour. That's my fear.

1679
01:43:35,652 --> 01:43:41,437
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know an ancient dwarven one that
says no risk...

1680
01:43:41,437 --> 01:43:43,124
SAM: That's it.

1681
01:43:43,124 --> 01:43:46,871
TALIESIN: Your mind is a grandfather clock, you
know that.

1682
01:43:46,871 --> 01:43:48,292
TRAVIS: Thank you.

1683
01:43:48,292 --> 01:43:51,176
TALIESIN: It's correct twice a day, easily.

1684
01:43:51,176 --> 01:43:54,889
SAM: If we go, what is our mission?

1685
01:43:54,889 --> 01:43:57,684
TALIESIN: <i>Thank</i> you.

1686
01:43:57,684 --> 01:44:01,231
MARISHA: To get as many innocents out as we can.

1687
01:44:01,231 --> 01:44:09,118
LAURA: No. That sounds wonderful, but if we get
people out, they're going to know something

1688
01:44:09,118 --> 01:44:10,277
happened.

1689
01:44:10,277 --> 01:44:15,897
MARISHA: I figured if we find good fighters once
again, and do our tree, our teleport thing--

1690
01:44:15,897 --> 01:44:18,498
SAM: We can get 13 people out. That's it.

1691
01:44:18,498 --> 01:44:21,338
MARISHA: But it could be the 13 people that could
change the tide.

1692
01:44:21,338 --> 01:44:23,833
TALIESIN: This is not going to be a fight of 13
people.

1693
01:44:23,833 --> 01:44:30,836
SAM: We had a group of 50 goliaths, and they were
all killed instantly.

1694
01:44:30,836 --> 01:44:33,993
MARISHA: That's what I'm saying.

1695
01:44:33,993 --> 01:44:38,405
LAURA: Plus, if we're lizard people, the survivors
aren't going to be wanting--

1696
01:44:38,405 --> 01:44:41,220
TALIESIN: They're going to be wondering who we
are, first off.

1697
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:42,576
LAURA: They're going to be afraid of us.

1698
01:44:42,576 --> 01:44:47,348
SAM: I would only want to go there if we had a
distinct plan to disrupt or trick or steal.

1699
01:44:47,348 --> 01:44:50,048
TRAVIS: Disrupting communications is a great
tactic.

1700
01:44:50,048 --> 01:44:52,423
TALIESIN: We're not going to be able to disrupt
communication.

1701
01:44:52,423 --> 01:44:54,833
TRAVIS: You don't think we're going to make it to
the jewels and smashy-smash?

1702
01:44:54,833 --> 01:44:55,791
TALIESIN: No.

1703
01:44:55,791 --> 01:44:57,149
MARISHA: I don't think that's a good idea.

1704
01:44:57,149 --> 01:45:04,625
SAM: And I slice the dragon's throat! And I say, I
am victorious!

1705
01:45:04,625 --> 01:45:07,948
LIAM: That sounds like a plan. Let's go.

1706
01:45:07,948 --> 01:45:13,887
MATT: So what are you guys doing?

1707
01:45:13,887 --> 01:45:18,151
TALIESIN: Tightening up. We're going to go. What
are we going for?

1708
01:45:18,151 --> 01:45:20,997
SAM: Smash the orbs.

1709
01:45:20,997 --> 01:45:27,197
MARISHA: Well, here's something else I want to put
into perspective. If I scry and teleport us to the

1710
01:45:27,197 --> 01:45:35,623
black dragon's lair, I can do one more scry, and
then I would burn my seventh level spell to get us

1711
01:45:35,623 --> 01:45:37,762
there again, and then I'd be tapped out.

1712
01:45:37,762 --> 01:45:39,790
LAURA: So we wouldn't be able to bamf out.

1713
01:45:39,790 --> 01:45:44,400
MARISHA: We wouldn't be able to bamf out that day.
We'd be staying the night.

1714
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:49,439
SAM: But I can get us a safe place to stay for the
night, no matter where we are.

1715
01:45:49,439 --> 01:45:52,785
TALIESIN: But it means this is not a one-day, this
is a three-day mission.

1716
01:45:52,785 --> 01:45:59,581
MARISHA: I could not teleport us. It depends on
how many times. I've got two teleports, so I can

1717
01:45:59,581 --> 01:46:02,504
teleport us there and teleport us out, but we'd be
doing it from here.

1718
01:46:02,504 --> 01:46:08,761
TALIESIN: We teleport to the black dragon's lair,
we sleep overnight, teleport in, teleport out. And

1719
01:46:08,761 --> 01:46:13,734
then sleep overnight, teleport either to
Whitestone or to Marquet.

1720
01:46:13,734 --> 01:46:17,288
SAM: Can you teleport today? Or are you done?

1721
01:46:17,288 --> 01:46:20,619
MATT: You can only use that once per day, though,
right?

1722
01:46:20,619 --> 01:46:37,897
MARISHA: I used Plane Shift. I didn't use
Transport Via Plants. Yes. Wait. No. I Moved

1723
01:46:37,897 --> 01:46:44,711
Earth. I can't do it today. It has to be tomorrow.
And if that's the case, it's tomorrow, then we

1724
01:46:44,711 --> 01:46:53,470
lose that two-day grace period. Unless we go right
now and sleep overnight in Draconia and start

1725
01:46:53,470 --> 01:46:54,727
first thing in the morning.

1726
01:46:54,727 --> 01:46:59,269
TALIESIN: And risk a very reasonable reason that
they would know where we are.

1727
01:46:59,269 --> 01:47:03,877
MATT: As far as I know, Plane Shift can't teleport
you on the same plane. It brings you specifically

1728
01:47:03,877 --> 01:47:05,503
to another plane of existence.

1729
01:47:05,503 --> 01:47:11,649
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm saying I cast Plane Shift from
the Feywild to here. That's all I'm saying. But I

1730
01:47:11,649 --> 01:47:13,447
used that, and that's a seventh level spell.

1731
01:47:13,447 --> 01:47:17,746
SAM: So if we go to Draconia tonight, if we want
to sleep in the mansion, we can't, because I

1732
01:47:17,746 --> 01:47:19,713
changed his memory.

1733
01:47:19,713 --> 01:47:21,955
LAURA: Oh fuck.

1734
01:47:21,955 --> 01:47:25,840
SAM: So we would have to sleep out in the open as
lizard people.

1735
01:47:25,905 --> 01:47:26,979
LAURA: Nope.

1736
01:47:26,979 --> 01:47:29,123
LIAM: Too many negatives now.

1737
01:47:29,123 --> 01:47:31,008
LAURA: This is danger zone.

1738
01:47:31,008 --> 01:47:34,960
MARISHA: We're getting a lot of cons. There's not
so many pros.

1739
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:37,642
TALIESIN: We need to sleep anyway, because we're
exhausted.

1740
01:47:37,642 --> 01:47:41,787
TRAVIS: Oh man. I can find all sorts of problems
with a situation if I look hard enough.

1741
01:47:41,787 --> 01:47:48,527
TALIESIN: That is so astute. It's 12:00. My god,
he had a thought.

1742
01:47:48,527 --> 01:47:54,613
TRAVIS: Opportunity. Honestly. There's a dragon's
perch, and he is vacated, and it will probably

1743
01:47:54,613 --> 01:47:56,745
never happen again as far as we know.

1744
01:47:56,745 --> 01:48:00,231
TALIESIN: I disagree. I think the next time they
come to attack and kill us, it will be vacated.

1745
01:48:00,231 --> 01:48:04,066
TRAVIS: Cool. While they're killing Whitestone
because we didn't take advantage of this moment,

1746
01:48:04,066 --> 01:48:05,841
then we'll go to Draconia.

1747
01:48:05,841 --> 01:48:09,034
TALIESIN: I agree. I legitimately agree.

1748
01:48:09,034 --> 01:48:13,386
LAURA: We can sleep and wake up in the morning and
teleport there.

1749
01:48:13,386 --> 01:48:17,615
TALIESIN: We do have to sleep, regardless. There's
no getting around sleep.

1750
01:48:17,615 --> 01:48:21,523
LAURA: We can't fucking go there when we haven't
slept, Grog. We'll all die.

1751
01:48:21,523 --> 01:48:23,654
TALIESIN: We can't actually get there right now.

1752
01:48:23,654 --> 01:48:26,765
MARISHA: There's also no guarantee that they're
going straight back there. Maybe they're heading

1753
01:48:26,765 --> 01:48:31,823
somewhere else. They were heading with an army to
somewhere. It's probably not a city they've

1754
01:48:31,823 --> 01:48:33,195
already conquered.

1755
01:48:33,195 --> 01:48:34,454
TALIESIN: They were heading southeast.

1756
01:48:34,454 --> 01:48:36,161
MATT: Southeast is what you saw, yes.

1757
01:48:36,161 --> 01:48:37,417
SAM: That's where they live.

1758
01:48:37,417 --> 01:48:39,877
TALIESIN: So they're probably heading back home.

1759
01:48:39,877 --> 01:48:42,888
MARISHA: Balls. Then where did they come from?
What were they doing?

1760
01:48:42,888 --> 01:48:44,964
LIAM: They were fishing.

1761
01:48:44,964 --> 01:48:52,212
TALIESIN: They thought that we might be here, and
they took a quick look around, which is why I

1762
01:48:52,212 --> 01:48:54,435
don't want to make any more noise around here.

1763
01:48:54,435 --> 01:48:56,153
SAM: Let's sleep.

1764
01:48:56,153 --> 01:48:57,743
TALIESIN: I'm going to go to the barkeep.

1765
01:48:57,743 --> 01:49:03,905
MATT: There is no barkeep here. This tavern has
been opened just for you guys to be served. There

1766
01:49:03,905 --> 01:49:07,930
is no current owner here. Most everyone who helped
you open this are yourselves and a couple of

1767
01:49:07,930 --> 01:49:09,386
civilians that were just there.

1768
01:49:09,386 --> 01:49:10,855
TALIESIN: Is there a civilian waitress?

1769
01:49:10,855 --> 01:49:14,941
MATT: There is no waitress. There are a couple
civilians outside, but as soon as you guys started

1770
01:49:14,941 --> 01:49:16,443
talking, all the civilians left the room.

1771
01:49:16,443 --> 01:49:17,615
LAURA: They're so nice.

1772
01:49:17,615 --> 01:49:19,672
TALIESIN: There's no barmaid at all?

1773
01:49:19,672 --> 01:49:21,457
LIAM: Your nobility is showing, Percival.

1774
01:49:21,457 --> 01:49:24,688
SAM: I need a young boy.

1775
01:49:24,688 --> 01:49:28,620
(laughter)

1776
01:49:28,620 --> 01:49:33,648
LIAM: These white gloves are sullied. I need a new
set of white gloves, please.

1777
01:49:33,708 --> 01:49:37,999
TALIESIN: They're shooting mittens, and you're
so uncouth.

1778
01:49:37,999 --> 01:49:41,812
SAM: I have an Unseen Servant. Do you need a
servant? I make an Unseen Servant for him.

1779
01:49:41,896 --> 01:49:44,024
MATT: There's a wisp of air.

1780
01:49:44,024 --> 01:49:46,362
SAM: Command him as you see fit.

1781
01:49:46,362 --> 01:49:51,372
TALIESIN: Never mind. This is what I get for
trying to be nice to anybody. I've learned my

1782
01:49:51,372 --> 01:49:52,240
lesson.

1783
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:53,764
SAM: I tip the Unseen Servant.

1784
01:49:53,764 --> 01:49:57,594
MATT: You toss the coin and it (clinks) to the
ground.

1785
01:49:57,594 --> 01:49:59,372
TRAVIS: I pounce on it.

1786
01:49:59,372 --> 01:50:04,431
MATT: You (soft impact) into this weird cluster of
air. It's pushing your beard hair back, and your

1787
01:50:04,431 --> 01:50:08,711
mouth is full of all that air pushing into it as
you reach into the Unseen Servant, grab the coin,

1788
01:50:08,711 --> 01:50:09,958
and pull it out.

1789
01:50:09,958 --> 01:50:11,201
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1790
01:50:11,201 --> 01:50:13,613
MATT: Well done. You got a gold.

1791
01:50:13,613 --> 01:50:17,759
TALIESIN: We'll sleep for now. We'll wake up in
the morning, and we'll either go in one direction

1792
01:50:17,759 --> 01:50:18,976
or the other.

1793
01:50:18,976 --> 01:50:21,029
LAURA: Good plan, guys. Good plan.

1794
01:50:21,029 --> 01:50:23,716
MARISHA: We came up with nothing.

1795
01:50:23,716 --> 01:50:27,960
TALIESIN: That's so not true. We came up with a
lot. We just have to sleep and then make a

1796
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:30,391
decision based on what the world looks like in the
morning.

1797
01:50:30,391 --> 01:50:33,206
LIAM: Dream about a cloak, Percival. Maybe we can
get you a cloak.

1798
01:50:33,206 --> 01:50:36,562
TALIESIN: That cloak sounds useful.

1799
01:50:36,562 --> 01:50:39,710
MARISHA: All right, let's sleep. Let's go to the
castle.

1800
01:50:39,710 --> 01:50:41,366
MATT: You guys find your way to the castle.

1801
01:50:41,366 --> 01:50:46,713
TALIESIN: As a side, I want to grab Vex for a
quick walk on the way to the castle. I want to go

1802
01:50:46,713 --> 01:50:50,961
by the cemetery. Has it been worked on, by the
way? I suppose I'll find out.

1803
01:50:50,961 --> 01:50:52,440
LIAM: You did say Vex, right?

1804
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:53,498
TALIESIN: Vax.

1805
01:50:53,498 --> 01:50:54,531
LIAM: You said Vex.

1806
01:50:54,531 --> 01:51:00,661
TALIESIN: <i>Vax.</i> I've been drinking. I've not even
been drinking, I've been pretend drinking.

1807
01:51:00,709 --> 01:51:04,208
MATT: All right. You grab him.

1808
01:51:04,208 --> 01:51:06,270
TALIESIN: I have something to show you.

1809
01:51:06,270 --> 01:51:07,338
LIAM: What is it?

1810
01:51:07,338 --> 01:51:09,363
TALIESIN: You'll like it. Well, I don't know if
you'll like it. I don't know what you like. I'm

1811
01:51:09,363 --> 01:51:17,180
going to take him to the cemetery, to the crypt.
The title I gave your sister doesn't come with

1812
01:51:17,180 --> 01:51:27,608
much, but it does come with one, at the moment,
tiny plot of land, on which a crypt sits. This was

1813
01:51:27,608 --> 01:51:35,470
the resting place of the father and grandfather
and assorted family members of the man you killed

1814
01:51:35,470 --> 01:51:37,499
the first night we came here.

1815
01:51:37,499 --> 01:51:39,738
LIAM: You want my sister to live in a mausoleum?

1816
01:51:39,738 --> 01:51:49,356
TALIESIN: No. I want something else to live in a
mausoleum. This is actually for you. Open it. I go and I

1817
01:51:49,356 --> 01:51:57,473
light the two little torches on the side. This is
very traditional, and it should open. Do you trust me?

1818
01:51:57,473 --> 01:52:00,887
LIAM: Uh...

1819
01:52:00,887 --> 01:52:03,184
TALIESIN: Good answer. I'll go in first.

1820
01:52:03,184 --> 01:52:05,448
MATT: Percy enters the building.

1821
01:52:05,448 --> 01:52:06,808
LIAM: I follow.

1822
01:52:06,808 --> 01:52:12,598
MATT: Okay. As you enter the mausoleum, the gentle
flickering of torchlight that was lit by Percy

1823
01:52:12,598 --> 01:52:17,931
shows the interior, though it is low-lit
partially, and your darkvision does catch you.

1824
01:52:17,931 --> 01:52:25,641
What was once a relatively decent mausoleum seems
to have been gutted, retrofit, and now you see

1825
01:52:25,641 --> 01:52:31,981
standing before you, is a mostly constructed
shrine to the Raven Queen.

1826
01:52:31,981 --> 01:52:42,752
TALIESIN: I figured it would be a good idea. I've
had my fill of gods, but I'm not so foolish to

1827
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:47,893
think that we do not need them still. This is here
when you need it.

1828
01:52:47,893 --> 01:52:59,204
LIAM: I am having trouble.

1829
01:52:59,204 --> 01:53:10,088
TALIESIN: Me, too. I do not want to die who I am.
I would like to live long enough to be someone

1830
01:53:10,088 --> 01:53:17,303
else. I think you understand that.

1831
01:53:17,303 --> 01:53:27,672
LIAM: I've been really angry at you.

1832
01:53:27,672 --> 01:53:31,142
TALIESIN: I've been encouraging it.

1833
01:53:31,142 --> 01:53:37,635
LIAM: I don't know if it's entirely fair, but I
can't shake it. I don't know that I'm willing to

1834
01:53:37,635 --> 01:53:39,340
let go of it yet.

1835
01:53:39,340 --> 01:53:50,204
TALIESIN: Good. I certainly do not deserve it yet.
I don't know if I ever will. But I can't think of

1836
01:53:50,204 --> 01:53:58,880
anything else to do with my time on earth right
now, other than... this. I am finished with gods.

1837
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:02,888
They will not help me. Maybe you will.

1838
01:54:02,888 --> 01:54:04,873
LIAM: Percy.

1839
01:54:04,873 --> 01:54:06,131
TALIESIN: Yes?

1840
01:54:06,131 --> 01:54:12,537
LIAM: I've always liked you. From the beginning,
I've always liked you.

1841
01:54:12,537 --> 01:54:15,430
TALIESIN: I've always liked you, too.

1842
01:54:15,430 --> 01:54:21,926
LIAM: You are intelligent and charming.

1843
01:54:21,926 --> 01:54:23,894
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1844
01:54:23,894 --> 01:54:28,337
LIAM: And good in a tight spot.

1845
01:54:28,337 --> 01:54:38,684
TALIESIN: It's the open spaces where I suffer. The
tight spots, I feel very good about. It's the open

1846
01:54:38,684 --> 01:54:41,833
spaces. This is a very tight spot.

1847
01:54:41,833 --> 01:54:48,707
LIAM: I would like to be friends with you again. I
just have a condition.

1848
01:54:48,707 --> 01:54:50,406
TALIESIN: Yes?

1849
01:54:50,406 --> 01:55:00,268
LIAM: My penchant for forgiveness with my sister's
welfare is razor thin.

1850
01:55:00,268 --> 01:55:01,952
TALIESIN: I know.

1851
01:55:01,952 --> 01:55:06,881
LIAM: If you can respect that, then we don't have
a problem.

1852
01:55:06,881 --> 01:55:13,337
TALIESIN: Do you know why I titled your sister?

1853
01:55:13,337 --> 01:55:16,757
LIAM: I have some idea.

1854
01:55:16,757 --> 01:55:27,047
TALIESIN: She thought she was missing something
that-- and I use this term loosely-- ordinary

1855
01:55:27,047 --> 01:55:37,033
people... We have a magic we use, to convince
people that we deserve the things we get, those of

1856
01:55:37,033 --> 01:55:50,780
us who were born this way. It was treating her
unfairly and limiting her ability to see her world

1857
01:55:50,780 --> 01:56:03,302
for what it was worth, and it was a simple and
easy fix. She is going to wake up one morning--

1858
01:56:03,302 --> 01:56:13,137
not yet, but soon-- and realize that money will
not make her happy, and that trying to please that

1859
01:56:13,137 --> 01:56:22,489
awful father will not make her happy. The first
step in that is realizing that he's weak, and

1860
01:56:22,489 --> 01:56:27,243
there's no better way to do that than being better
titled than your parents.

1861
01:56:27,243 --> 01:56:33,192
LIAM: I don't agree with that line of thinking.

1862
01:56:33,192 --> 01:56:38,753
TALIESIN: I know. But you are not her. And I'm not
saying it's the truth, but it is what I believe is

1863
01:56:38,753 --> 01:56:50,318
in her heart. I think perhaps that might lift. I
will never hurt her. I will never hurt anybody

1864
01:56:50,318 --> 01:56:58,278
intentionally, especially not you, any more than I
already have. In return, I ask: never take your

1865
01:56:58,278 --> 01:57:05,800
eyes off me. Never trust me. And that is the best
friend that you can be.

1866
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:11,986
LIAM: I will recommit to that same promise I
made.

1867
01:57:11,986 --> 01:57:18,152
TALIESIN: You can like me. I would love that. And
in fact, I hope that I can earn your like.

1868
01:57:18,152 --> 01:57:20,185
LIAM: I do like you.

1869
01:57:20,185 --> 01:57:21,985
TALIESIN: I just never want to earn your trust.

1870
01:57:21,985 --> 01:57:24,263
LIAM: Well, then it's your lucky day.

1871
01:57:24,263 --> 01:57:37,123
TALIESIN: A gentle title will suit your sister
well. I'm leaving.

1872
01:57:37,123 --> 01:57:49,243
MATT: Percy walks out. You're left alone in the
silence and darkness, looking at the small shrine

1873
01:57:49,243 --> 01:57:51,768
before you.

1874
01:57:51,768 --> 01:58:09,724
LIAM: I'm on board. You have me. Whatever you
will. I have something I need to take care of,

1875
01:58:09,724 --> 01:58:22,374
which you know, and I hope you will help me with
it. But I do not take your gift lightly. You have

1876
01:58:22,374 --> 01:58:30,126
me. I close the door again and head back to town.

1877
01:58:30,126 --> 01:58:39,464
MATT: Back into town. You guys quietly keep your
distance in your walk, find your way back to the

1878
01:58:39,464 --> 01:58:44,053
castle to your respective rooms, and an evening's
rest takes you all.

1879
01:58:44,053 --> 01:58:50,131
MARISHA: Do I hear Vax go to his room?

1880
01:58:50,131 --> 01:58:52,376
MATT: Are you waiting to hear Vax go to his room?

1881
01:58:52,376 --> 01:58:53,965
MARISHA: I'm waiting to hear Vax go to his room.

1882
01:58:53,965 --> 01:58:59,808
MATT: Actually, knowing Vax, you wouldn't hear
anything.

1883
01:58:59,808 --> 01:59:06,020
(laughter)

1884
01:59:06,020 --> 01:59:10,854
LIAM: 30.

1885
01:59:10,854 --> 01:59:15,194
MATT: You wait for a long time, and no sound comes
to your ears.

1886
01:59:15,194 --> 01:59:16,827
MARISHA: I go to sleep.

1887
01:59:16,827 --> 01:59:22,511
MATT: All right. And with that, as you guys rest
for the night, we're going to take a quick

1888
01:59:22,511 --> 01:59:28,306
bathroom break. We'll be back here in a few
minutes. We had a friend come and deliver a gift

1889
01:59:28,306 --> 01:59:36,032
to Laura, which you can see presented on the table
now. It is a replica that someone, Kiki Day, made

1890
01:59:36,032 --> 01:59:39,622
this awesome prop replica of Fenthras.

1891
01:59:39,622 --> 01:59:44,325
LAURA: I wish you guys could see it up close.
Obviously, we're going to send a picture on

1892
01:59:44,325 --> 01:59:49,378
Twitter so you guys can see it, but it lights up
different colors!

1893
01:59:49,378 --> 01:59:53,697
MATT: Design based on David Rodriguez's concept
art for Fenthras.

1894
01:59:53,697 --> 01:59:59,100
LAURA: It's got Elvish for "protector" and
"growth."

1895
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:01,400
MATT: That's so badass.

1896
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:05,995
LAURA: Did I say it right? Protector, not
protection? Protector is right!

1897
02:00:05,995 --> 02:00:07,903
MARISHA: Protector and growth.

1898
02:00:07,903 --> 02:00:09,707
LAURA: Say what?!

1899
02:00:09,707 --> 02:00:10,851
MATT: That is awesome.

1900
02:00:10,851 --> 02:00:12,041
LAURA: Thank you so much!

1901
02:00:12,041 --> 02:00:13,074
MATT: Thank you, Kiki!

1902
02:00:13,074 --> 02:00:14,590
LAURA: You're unbelievable.

1903
02:00:14,590 --> 02:00:15,991
TRAVIS: Should we put it down?

1904
02:00:15,991 --> 02:00:17,749
MATT: All right. There we go.

1905
02:00:17,749 --> 02:00:19,443
LAURA: Lean it up against the table.

1906
02:00:19,443 --> 02:00:26,823
MATT: So. As you guys come to consciousness the
next morning, the storm has come in now--

1907
02:00:26,823 --> 02:00:31,762
LAURA: By the way, I got terrible sleep. I
replayed everything Saundor said in my head a

1908
02:00:31,762 --> 02:00:33,765
hundred times.

1909
02:00:33,765 --> 02:00:39,217
MATT: Make a general wisdom saving throw.

1910
02:00:39,217 --> 02:00:45,272
LIAM: You're paralyzed from fear.

1911
02:00:45,272 --> 02:00:55,426
LAURA: I am terrible! Wisdom saving throw?
12.

1912
02:00:55,426 --> 02:00:59,285
MATT: 12? Okay. Your evening is hard-pressed. You
do manage to get a full night's sleep; you do not

1913
02:00:59,285 --> 02:01:06,145
suffer any exhaustion. You do manage to get rest, though
the nightmares do come in memory of your last

1914
02:01:06,202 --> 02:01:11,451
encounter at the Feywild, and Saundor's words
still swimming around in your head, finding cracks

1915
02:01:11,451 --> 02:01:20,876
in your sense of self. But you still are stalwart
against the choice you made and the friends that

1916
02:01:20,876 --> 02:01:25,659
were at your back. And as you all come to
consciousness, the sound of rain outside of the

1917
02:01:25,659 --> 02:01:30,960
castle against the exterior stone greets you with
the morning. You can smell the fresh rain in the

1918
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:38,261
air, and eventually come down to find breakfast
prepared, a meal earned.

1919
02:01:38,261 --> 02:01:39,763
TALIESIN: Not chicken.

1920
02:01:39,763 --> 02:01:47,758
MATT: Not chicken, no. This is eggs, fruits. A
classic Whitestone breakfast. Chicken <i>is</i>

1921
02:01:47,758 --> 02:01:50,655
available, but strangely untouched.

1922
02:01:50,655 --> 02:01:52,453
LAURA: Baked beans. Tell me there's baked beans!

1923
02:01:52,453 --> 02:01:54,773
TALIESIN: The thick, single-slab bacon.

1924
02:01:54,773 --> 02:01:56,116
LIAM: Blood pudding.

1925
02:01:56,116 --> 02:01:58,458
MARISHA: Basically an Irish breakfast.

1926
02:01:58,458 --> 02:02:07,699
MATT: There are a few farms here, most are in the
surrounding fields south of the city. It's good.

1927
02:02:07,699 --> 02:02:08,767
It's fresh.

1928
02:02:08,767 --> 02:02:15,066
TALIESIN: The rain is good. It will mean that
they'll have an easier time figuring out the water

1929
02:02:15,066 --> 02:02:22,170
level while they're digging out beneath the Sun
Tree and making sure that it's secure. I love this

1930
02:02:22,170 --> 02:02:23,695
weather.

1931
02:02:23,695 --> 02:02:33,654
SAM: Well? To Marquet or to Draconia? What's it
going to be? Should we vote?

1932
02:02:33,654 --> 02:02:38,331
TALIESIN: An attempt at an object of power or an
attempt at friends in power?

1933
02:02:38,331 --> 02:02:40,245
SAM: Which is which?

1934
02:02:40,245 --> 02:02:42,450
TALIESIN: Draconia has friends in power.

1935
02:02:42,450 --> 02:02:46,616
MARISHA: Speaking of friends, we should probably
check up on ours.

1936
02:02:46,616 --> 02:02:53,111
TALIESIN: (long sigh) That is true. We haven't
heard anything, but that is true.

1937
02:02:53,111 --> 02:02:57,078
MARISHA: We haven't heard anything about him.

1938
02:02:57,078 --> 02:02:59,719
LAURA: It's terrifying.

1939
02:02:59,719 --> 02:03:01,581
MARISHA: I know.

1940
02:03:01,581 --> 02:03:03,997
SAM: He's probably okay.

1941
02:03:03,997 --> 02:03:06,199
TRAVIS: Who are we talking about?

1942
02:03:06,199 --> 02:03:07,940
(laughter)

1943
02:03:07,940 --> 02:03:09,341
SAM: Jarett.

1944
02:03:09,341 --> 02:03:10,616
TRAVIS: Oh.

1945
02:03:10,616 --> 02:03:15,694
SAM: Our only friend in Draconia.

1946
02:03:15,694 --> 02:03:19,971
TALIESIN: I personally would assume that Tiberius
would either be on his way to one of the two

1947
02:03:19,971 --> 02:03:24,998
cities, if he were so inclined. And if he had
survived. And if he wasn't working in the city

1948
02:03:24,998 --> 02:03:27,276
itself to keep it functioning.

1949
02:03:27,276 --> 02:03:33,049
MARISHA: He's hard-headed enough. So all of those
things are very true.

1950
02:03:33,049 --> 02:03:38,471
TALIESIN: And again, we're at war. This is not a
battle. We do not win by going to Draconia. We do

1951
02:03:38,471 --> 02:03:44,163
not win by going to Marquet. We win months from
now.

1952
02:03:44,163 --> 02:03:48,228
MARISHA: You're starting to make less and less
sense, Percy.

1953
02:03:48,228 --> 02:03:50,180
TALIESIN: No! I'm making perfect sense.

1954
02:03:50,180 --> 02:03:52,265
LIAM: Part of the traditional Whitestone breakfast
is--

1955
02:03:52,265 --> 02:03:54,432
LAURA: A rambling de Rolo.

1956
02:03:54,432 --> 02:03:58,583
TALIESIN: Breakfast needs things to live.

1957
02:03:58,583 --> 02:04:01,259
(laughter)

1958
02:04:01,259 --> 02:04:03,286
LIAM: I think you got that backwards?

1959
02:04:03,286 --> 02:04:09,022
SAM: Whitestone continental breakfast. Two eggs,
rambling tirade.

1960
02:04:09,022 --> 02:04:14,374
(laughter)

1961
02:04:14,374 --> 02:04:17,884
LAURA: Vote, then?

1962
02:04:17,884 --> 02:04:19,180
LIAM: Vote.

1963
02:04:19,180 --> 02:04:21,589
TALIESIN: I'm all right with a vote.

1964
02:04:21,589 --> 02:04:29,982
SAM: All right, all in favor of going to Marquet
to find a Vestige that will maybe give us some

1965
02:04:29,982 --> 02:04:33,110
more power that we need to kill a dragon, say
aye!

1966
02:04:33,110 --> 02:04:35,470
TALIESIN and LIAM: Aye.

1967
02:04:35,470 --> 02:04:40,591
SAM: All in favor of going to Draconia, where we
don't really have a great plan but I think we're

1968
02:04:40,591 --> 02:04:47,134
going to go try to fuck up a dragon's lair and
maybe rescue five people and probably die as

1969
02:04:47,134 --> 02:04:48,989
lizard people, say aye.

1970
02:04:48,989 --> 02:04:51,315
LAURA, TRAVIS, and SAM: Aye.

1971
02:04:51,315 --> 02:04:52,435
MARISHA: Aye.

1972
02:04:52,435 --> 02:04:55,746
LAURA: I've changed my mind. I want to go to
Marquet now.

1973
02:04:55,746 --> 02:04:57,656
SAM: Three to three.

1974
02:04:57,656 --> 02:05:02,560
LAURA: Sorry. Oh shit! I didn't mean to fuck that
up. Trinket, what's your vote?

1975
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:05,912
TALIESIN: Hold on, let's see if Ashley texts in
the next ten minutes.

1976
02:05:05,912 --> 02:05:10,773
MATT: Three versus three. Are you going leave it
up to the dice, being a game of DND?

1977
02:05:10,773 --> 02:05:12,486
SAM: Let's do it.

1978
02:05:12,486 --> 02:05:14,833
MARISHA: Where's that coin we have?

1979
02:05:14,833 --> 02:05:17,975
TALIESIN: I have it. I have it right here. Yeah.

1980
02:05:17,975 --> 02:05:20,627
LIAM: You could also do one to ten and 11 to 20.

1981
02:05:20,627 --> 02:05:22,167
TALIESIN: One or 20. Ready?

1982
02:05:22,167 --> 02:05:23,877
SAM: Wait, we're just doing one flip?

1983
02:05:23,877 --> 02:05:24,820
LAURA: Yeah!

1984
02:05:24,820 --> 02:05:25,976
SAM: No. What?!

1985
02:05:25,976 --> 02:05:29,385
TALIESIN: Yes. It's flipped!

1986
02:05:29,385 --> 02:05:30,585
LAURA: What is what?

1987
02:05:30,585 --> 02:05:32,879
MARISHA: Okay! 20 is Marquet and a one is
Draconia.

1988
02:05:32,879 --> 02:05:33,958
SAM: What about all the other numbers?

1989
02:05:33,958 --> 02:05:35,968
TALIESIN: There's only two! It's a coin!

1990
02:05:35,968 --> 02:05:38,546
MATT: 20, Marquet. One is Draconia.

1991
02:05:38,546 --> 02:05:40,525
TALIESIN: And any other number, we stay home.

1992
02:05:40,525 --> 02:05:43,760
LAURA: What is it?

1993
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:48,542
TALIESIN: We're going to Draconia, and we're going
to see if we could find Tiberius.

1994
02:05:48,542 --> 02:05:50,534
SAM: Oh god!

1995
02:05:50,534 --> 02:05:53,875
LAURA: Let it be known, I don't think we should go
as lizard people anymore.

1996
02:05:53,875 --> 02:05:55,182
TRAVIS: Why?

1997
02:05:55,182 --> 02:05:57,863
LAURA: I think we should go as ravaged
Draconians.

1998
02:05:57,863 --> 02:06:00,597
TALIESIN: I think we should go as Draconians.

1999
02:06:00,597 --> 02:06:04,673
MARISHA: We can make ourselves look like
dragonborn with Seeming?

2000
02:06:04,673 --> 02:06:06,616
TALIESIN: I think that's a better plan.

2001
02:06:06,616 --> 02:06:10,290
LAURA: At least that way, they'll trust us.

2002
02:06:10,290 --> 02:06:18,952
TALIESIN: We don't have to teleport to the middle
of nowhere. Well, we do need to get farther away

2003
02:06:18,952 --> 02:06:22,301
from here. Is there any way to get farther away
from where we are right now before we--

2004
02:06:22,301 --> 02:06:25,217
LIAM: Can we get back to Umbrasyl's lair? I
thought that was a good idea.

2005
02:06:25,217 --> 02:06:27,511
SAM: We could go there and there and back.

2006
02:06:27,511 --> 02:06:31,956
TALIESIN: Well, as long as we commit to 24 hours
in Draconia no matter what.

2007
02:06:31,956 --> 02:06:36,566
MARISHA: We can go to Umbrasyl's lair, but it'll
take an extra day, because I can only teleport us

2008
02:06:36,566 --> 02:06:37,996
so many times.

2009
02:06:37,996 --> 02:06:41,226
TALIESIN: I think 72 hours is a perfectly
reasonable amount of time to dedicate to this

2010
02:06:41,226 --> 02:06:42,491
prospect.

2011
02:06:42,491 --> 02:06:50,622
LAURA: Pop in, scry, pop into Draconia, look around
and next day, pop out. Can we do that?

2012
02:06:50,622 --> 02:06:52,109
SAM: Yep.

2013
02:06:52,109 --> 02:06:57,305
LIAM: If we stop at Umbrasyl's lair, is there
anything we can do to run Grog out like a

2014
02:06:57,305 --> 02:07:01,099
labrador? I'm worried about him not getting enough
playtime in.

2015
02:07:01,099 --> 02:07:03,061
SAM: In Draconia?

2016
02:07:03,061 --> 02:07:08,197
LIAM: No, in the mansion. Can you bamf up anything
for him in the mansion?

2017
02:07:08,197 --> 02:07:10,556
SAM: You're talking about tonight?

2018
02:07:10,556 --> 02:07:14,963
LIAM: No. We're going to go camp somewhere for a
day, right?

2019
02:07:14,963 --> 02:07:16,748
LAURA: No, we're going to Draconia.

2020
02:07:16,748 --> 02:07:17,880
LIAM: Right now?

2021
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:21,855
SAM: Go to the black dragon lair, then go to
Draconia, then spend a night <i>there.</i>

2022
02:07:21,855 --> 02:07:25,745
LIAM: I've been travelling with these fuckers for
years, and I still don't understand magic.

2023
02:07:25,745 --> 02:07:31,082
MARISHA: Hold on a second. We have two choices if
we're going to Draconia: we can either go to

2024
02:07:31,082 --> 02:07:36,674
Umbrasyl's lair to scry from there, then teleport
there, which means we will be staying the night in

2025
02:07:36,674 --> 02:07:37,735
Draconia.

2026
02:07:37,735 --> 02:07:38,875
SAM: In Draconia?

2027
02:07:38,875 --> 02:07:40,650
TALIESIN and MARISHA: In Draconia.

2028
02:07:40,650 --> 02:07:48,918
MARISHA: Or we go to Draconia right now, blindly,
and then I'd still have a spell to get us out.

2029
02:07:48,918 --> 02:07:50,878
SAM: But they could track us back here.

2030
02:07:50,878 --> 02:07:53,449
LAURA: How can we go there blindly if you don't
know where a tree is?

2031
02:07:53,449 --> 02:07:54,665
MARISHA: Well, I'd scry.

2032
02:07:54,665 --> 02:07:57,163
SAM: And then they'd know where <i>we</i> are.

2033
02:07:57,163 --> 02:07:59,988
MARISHA: They could theoretically, if we get
caught.

2034
02:07:59,988 --> 02:08:03,245
LAURA: We would only scry on a tree. We wouldn't
scry on a dragon.

2035
02:08:03,245 --> 02:08:05,052
TALIESIN: I have a compromise.

2036
02:08:05,052 --> 02:08:11,288
SAM: Actually, can I just throw this out? The only
thing that would detect us scrying is currently

2037
02:08:11,288 --> 02:08:14,882
flying over the ocean. We can scry right now.

2038
02:08:14,882 --> 02:08:19,444
TALIESIN: Let's scry from the giant's cave outside
the city.

2039
02:08:19,444 --> 02:08:21,843
LAURA: It'll still take a couple of hours to get
there, though?

2040
02:08:21,843 --> 02:08:24,899
TALIESIN: Couple of hours to get there. It's fine.
It's nine. It's seven--

2041
02:08:24,899 --> 02:08:27,286
LAURA: It's 5:00 in the morning!

2042
02:08:27,286 --> 02:08:30,070
TALIESIN: It's 3am! Why are we awake?

2043
02:08:30,070 --> 02:08:33,018
MATT: You're still drunk somehow.

2044
02:08:33,018 --> 02:08:39,047
TALIESIN: We get far enough outside of the city so
at the very least--

2045
02:08:39,047 --> 02:08:41,763
SAM: To the giant's lair! To scry!

2046
02:08:41,763 --> 02:08:48,664
MATT: North of the city, up into the beginning
stages of the Alabaster Sierras, you find the

2047
02:08:48,664 --> 02:08:55,699
abandoned fortress that is there, embedded on the
side of the mountain wall. Keyleth, you are

2048
02:08:55,699 --> 02:08:59,062
attempting a scrying spell? What are you scrying
on?

2049
02:08:59,062 --> 02:09:04,617
MARISHA: Okay. I have the map of Draconia, let me
just see if I can scry--

2050
02:09:04,617 --> 02:09:09,970
SAM: You know what you know in Draconia? Do you
know what you <i>know</i> in Draconia? You know

2051
02:09:09,970 --> 02:09:15,183
Tiberius and you know his armor, and you know his
objects and personal effects?

2052
02:09:15,183 --> 02:09:17,331
MARISHA: No, we don't know if he's in
Draconia.

2053
02:09:17,386 --> 02:09:19,562
TALIESIN: We may end up somewhere random.

2054
02:09:19,562 --> 02:09:22,846
SAM: That's true. but what do you know what is in
Draconia?

2055
02:09:22,846 --> 02:09:25,806
MARISHA: I know of the things that Tiberius has
told us.

2056
02:09:25,806 --> 02:09:30,969
SAM: Do you know any of his friends or his family?
Have we met his family?

2057
02:09:30,969 --> 02:09:33,546
MATT: You have not met his family. You've never
been there.

2058
02:09:33,546 --> 02:09:38,983
MARISHA: I don't need to have a known location, 
right? I can just scry in a general area, yeah?

2059
02:09:38,983 --> 02:09:41,898
MATT: You need generally a creature of some kind.

2060
02:09:41,898 --> 02:09:43,971
SAM: What about his little pet?

2061
02:09:43,971 --> 02:09:46,673
LAURA: Are you not scrying on a tree?

2062
02:09:46,673 --> 02:09:48,246
LIAM: Lockheed.

2063
02:09:48,246 --> 02:09:53,582
MARISHA: Lockheed has a higher chance of being
dead than Tiberius.

2064
02:09:53,582 --> 02:09:57,545
TALIESIN: I think that's underestimating, or
overestimating-- I don't know.

2065
02:09:57,545 --> 02:09:59,507
LIAM: It's a coin flip.

2066
02:09:59,507 --> 02:10:03,129
TALIESIN: It's a coin flip, really. He's small.

2067
02:10:03,129 --> 02:10:08,584
MARISHA: Well, this could answer our question. If
I can't find anybody, then we might be going to

2068
02:10:08,584 --> 02:10:10,279
Marquet.

2069
02:10:10,279 --> 02:10:11,317
SAM: That's true.

2070
02:10:11,317 --> 02:10:12,908
TALIESIN: Go for it, then. See what happens.

2071
02:10:12,908 --> 02:10:19,420
MARISHA: I guess it's Tiberius, then? He's all I
got. It's got to be someone that I know? It

2072
02:10:19,489 --> 02:10:21,596
can't be something I've heard about?

2073
02:10:21,596 --> 02:10:26,978
MATT: It can be something you've heard about. A
person or a creature.

2074
02:10:26,978 --> 02:10:29,081
TALIESIN: A person or a creature, not a place?

2075
02:10:29,081 --> 02:10:32,003
MATT: Not necessarily, no.

2076
02:10:32,003 --> 02:10:34,230
TALIESIN: Can it be a magic object?

2077
02:10:34,230 --> 02:10:37,473
MATT: It would be a creature of some kind.

2078
02:10:37,473 --> 02:10:40,647
TRAVIS: We know about Tiberius. We know about
Kruvanis Stormwind.

2079
02:10:40,647 --> 02:10:42,704
SAM: We know of Lockheed.

2080
02:10:42,704 --> 02:10:47,575
LIAM: The Mending Wheel. A creature only? Oh shit.
Fucking magic!

2081
02:10:47,575 --> 02:10:49,432
LAURA: That's what he just said!

2082
02:10:49,432 --> 02:10:54,992
MARISHA: Are we gambling on Tiberius being
there?

2083
02:10:54,992 --> 02:10:57,117
SAM: You're going to gamble on Tiberius?

2084
02:10:57,117 --> 02:11:01,212
MARISHA: I am gambling on whoever we scry to,
because they could all be dead.

2085
02:11:01,212 --> 02:11:03,964
SAM: How many times can you scry?

2086
02:11:03,964 --> 02:11:07,430
MARISHA: Theoretically, four times.

2087
02:11:07,430 --> 02:11:10,051
LAURA: I've also got a Scrying Stone.

2088
02:11:10,051 --> 02:11:12,510
TALIESIN: Start with the stone.

2089
02:11:12,510 --> 02:11:15,594
MARISHA: That's right, you've got that goddamn
thing. Give me the stone.

2090
02:11:15,594 --> 02:11:17,918
LAURA: Here.

2091
02:11:17,918 --> 02:11:19,257
MARISHA: Thank you!

2092
02:11:19,257 --> 02:11:22,350
TALIESIN: I think we should call it rock. The
Rock.

2093
02:11:22,350 --> 02:11:23,978
MARISHA: It doesn't go away, right?

2094
02:11:23,978 --> 02:11:25,911
LAURA: No. it's a Scrying Eye. You can use it once
a day.

2095
02:11:25,911 --> 02:11:27,566
MARISHA: Yeah. Let's do this!

2096
02:11:27,566 --> 02:11:29,312
SAM: Start with Tiberius.

2097
02:11:29,312 --> 02:11:30,877
TALIESIN: Start with Tiberius. We'll work our way
down.

2098
02:11:30,877 --> 02:11:32,276
MARISHA: Start with Tiberius.

2099
02:11:32,276 --> 02:11:33,907
LAURA: I was going to bring it out!

2100
02:11:33,907 --> 02:11:35,905
TALIESIN: No, you did wonderfully.

2101
02:11:35,905 --> 02:11:37,796
LAURA: It was just sitting there.

2102
02:11:37,796 --> 02:11:43,693
MATT: You take the object. You close your eyes,
focusing on the memory and the life essence of

2103
02:11:43,693 --> 02:11:55,217
Tiberius Stormwind. You project your thoughts into
the ether. The nature energies carry you into

2104
02:11:55,217 --> 02:11:58,061
the darkness, and there is no response.

2105
02:11:58,061 --> 02:11:59,287
SAM: No response?

2106
02:11:59,287 --> 02:12:01,800
MATT: No response. The scrying spell finds no
target.

2107
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:04,871
TALIESIN: That can mean a lot of things.

2108
02:12:04,871 --> 02:12:08,943
LIAM: Yes, does that stretch across the planes?

2109
02:12:08,943 --> 02:12:11,379
SAM: Does it?

2110
02:12:11,379 --> 02:12:14,659
MATT: Generally, it's on the same plane of
existence.

2111
02:12:14,659 --> 02:12:17,941
SAM: Okay. What about his father?

2112
02:12:17,941 --> 02:12:19,872
TALIESIN: Or Lockheed?

2113
02:12:19,872 --> 02:12:22,145
SAM: Well, Lockheed would be with--

2114
02:12:22,145 --> 02:12:26,849
TALIESIN: Not necessarily. How many times have we
found stray cats?

2115
02:12:26,849 --> 02:12:30,082
LAURA: It's true. Maybe scry on Lockheed.

2116
02:12:30,082 --> 02:12:33,690
MARISHA: Can I try it? Will it expend
another spell?

2117
02:12:33,690 --> 02:12:35,608
MATT: This one will expend a spell.

2118
02:12:35,667 --> 02:12:38,720
MARISHA: It lasts for ten minutes? Oh, per spell.

2119
02:12:38,720 --> 02:12:41,410
SAM: So you're burning your own spell slot.

2120
02:12:41,410 --> 02:12:43,072
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm burning my own spells.

2121
02:12:43,072 --> 02:12:45,079
LAURA: At least you got one for free.

2122
02:12:45,079 --> 02:12:46,565
SAM: Thanks, Vex.

2123
02:12:46,565 --> 02:12:48,598
MARISHA: It makes me very nervous.

2124
02:12:48,598 --> 02:12:50,133
SAM: We should do his dad.

2125
02:12:50,133 --> 02:12:53,730
TALIESIN: That would be who I would kill if I were
taking over the city.

2126
02:12:53,730 --> 02:12:57,118
SAM: You just want to kill everybody.

2127
02:12:57,118 --> 02:12:58,313
TALIESIN: I do.

2128
02:12:58,313 --> 02:13:02,765
MARISHA: I'm going to try Lockheed. His dad could
be in a place where he's being watched.

2129
02:13:02,765 --> 02:13:09,093
MATT: Okay. So this time, you give the object back
to Vex and you sit down and create the ritual

2130
02:13:09,093 --> 02:13:13,736
space before you. You sit down in the center of
the stone floor of the fortress and you close your

2131
02:13:13,736 --> 02:13:19,994
eyes. This time, you send out your consciousness
once more. The druidic energies carry you an

2132
02:13:19,994 --> 02:13:25,938
extended distance in but a few moments, and your
vision clicks in and you see, perched against a

2133
02:13:25,938 --> 02:13:35,817
snow-covered rock in the inside of a ravine, a
shivering, small, green dragonling. Alone, and is

2134
02:13:35,817 --> 02:13:41,270
partially asleep against the stone. You can see
just past over this large, gaping ravine that is

2135
02:13:41,270 --> 02:13:48,267
the center of this portion of Wildemount, you can
see scattered rubble covered in ice and snow

2136
02:13:48,267 --> 02:13:54,367
and small distant things you can't quite make out
with your vision here occasionally moving through it.

2137
02:13:54,367 --> 02:13:56,258
SAM: Can you see any trees?

2138
02:13:56,258 --> 02:13:58,081
MARISHA: Do I find any trees?

2139
02:13:58,081 --> 02:14:03,293
MATT: Make a perception check.

2140
02:14:03,293 --> 02:14:05,840
MARISHA: 19.

2141
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:13,530
MATT: 19. There's no visible trees in the ravine.
Anything that would be living down there has

2142
02:14:13,530 --> 02:14:21,719
been-- from your vision here-- obscured by rock,
rubble, ruined floating island, and snowfall. You

2143
02:14:21,719 --> 02:14:26,896
do see growing out of the side of the rock, not
far from where Lockheed is perched is one

2144
02:14:26,896 --> 02:14:36,737
leafless, small branch of a tree that extends out.
And as you glance up, there is a very thick tree

2145
02:14:36,737 --> 02:14:40,173
that is currently jutting out the side of the
mountain.

2146
02:14:40,173 --> 02:14:42,423
MARISHA: Does it appear to be natural?

2147
02:14:42,423 --> 02:14:43,907
MATT: It does.

2148
02:14:43,907 --> 02:14:45,774
MARISHA: And large enough to fit Grog?

2149
02:14:45,774 --> 02:14:47,605
MATT: Maybe.

2150
02:14:47,605 --> 02:14:49,293
LAURA: Jutting out the side of--

2151
02:14:49,293 --> 02:14:53,258
MATT: Yeah. It's not sitting on ground, but is
currently over the ravine.

2152
02:14:53,258 --> 02:15:00,159
MARISHA: Yeah, one of those. Any other trees? Is
this the biggest or closest one?

2153
02:15:00,159 --> 02:15:02,435
MATT: That's all you can make out from this
perspective.

2154
02:15:02,435 --> 02:15:06,011
MARISHA: How big is the ravine? How deep is it?

2155
02:15:06,011 --> 02:15:11,489
MATT: From where you can tell right now, from the
perspective you can see, looking at Lockheed, it's

2156
02:15:11,489 --> 02:15:18,806
probably a good 50-foot fall before you hit a
scattering of broken rock, and eventually it

2157
02:15:18,806 --> 02:15:21,635
comes into a grade to the bottom of the ravine.

2158
02:15:21,635 --> 02:15:23,059
TRAVIS: Not great.

2159
02:15:23,059 --> 02:15:25,130
MARISHA: Not a good option.

2160
02:15:25,130 --> 02:15:28,466
MATT: You guys have fallen 50 feet and been
fine.

2161
02:15:28,466 --> 02:15:34,465
SAM: Someone has Feather Fall, right? No?

2162
02:15:34,465 --> 02:15:41,216
MARISHA: Did it look like a natural cavern or a
man-made cavern that Lockheed was in?

2163
02:15:41,216 --> 02:15:44,680
MATT: From what you can tell, it looks natural.

2164
02:15:44,680 --> 02:15:47,815
MARISHA: Like he found a little cave and is
hiding?

2165
02:15:47,815 --> 02:15:51,490
MATT: It's less of a cave and more he's perched on
this little alcove, this little outcropping of

2166
02:15:51,490 --> 02:15:53,651
rock on the side of the ravine wall.

2167
02:15:53,651 --> 02:15:55,235
MARISHA: Oh, he's on the side of the ravine.

2168
02:15:55,235 --> 02:15:56,684
MATT: On the side of the ravine.

2169
02:15:56,684 --> 02:16:04,349
LAURA: Okay, I have an idea. What if we tie a rope
on something on this side and we all go out of the

2170
02:16:04,349 --> 02:16:07,258
rope really fast and drop down?

2171
02:16:07,258 --> 02:16:08,599
TALIESIN: Grog first.

2172
02:16:08,599 --> 02:16:15,910
SAM: Should you scry one more time, for the dad?
Because best-case scenario, we're in a weird,

2173
02:16:15,910 --> 02:16:19,426
snowy ravine with no civilization around.

2174
02:16:19,426 --> 02:16:24,280
TALIESIN: We don't want to be around any
civilization. And also, that's one more spell gone.

2175
02:16:24,280 --> 02:16:28,827
MATT: You did see, distant, blurred from your
perspective, since the focus of the scry was on

2176
02:16:28,827 --> 02:16:36,470
Lockheed, you did see movement and very small
distant objects within the snow at the base of the ravine.

2177
02:16:36,470 --> 02:16:38,916
LAURA: They could potentially see us as soon as we
come out of the tree.

2178
02:16:38,916 --> 02:16:41,351
SAM: Yeah, we'll be far away.

2179
02:16:41,351 --> 02:16:44,587
MARISHA: They could be citizens, they could be
creatures? I just saw movement of figures, I

2180
02:16:44,587 --> 02:16:45,964
didn't see any details?

2181
02:16:45,964 --> 02:16:48,467
SAM: Seems like a good plan.

2182
02:16:48,467 --> 02:16:49,632
LAURA: This is risky.

2183
02:16:49,632 --> 02:16:51,060
MARISHA: This is ridiculous.

2184
02:16:51,060 --> 02:16:56,696
TALIESIN: It's true. There's only risk at this
point. Is this the risk we make or is this not the

2185
02:16:56,696 --> 02:16:58,609
risk we make. Grog?

2186
02:16:58,609 --> 02:17:02,448
TRAVIS: Oh, are we asking for Grog's opinion now?

2187
02:17:02,448 --> 02:17:04,221
TALIESIN: Only so that we can ignore it.

2188
02:17:04,221 --> 02:17:09,003
LAURA: You're the one that was most adamant about us
going there.

2189
02:17:09,068 --> 02:17:11,748
TALIESIN: With the new data, how do you feel?

2190
02:17:11,748 --> 02:17:15,100
TRAVIS: I think we should take the hint and not
go.

2191
02:17:15,100 --> 02:17:17,477
SAM: But you said--

2192
02:17:17,477 --> 02:17:22,219
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I was picturing meandering
out of a nice, beautiful tree in a forest.

2193
02:17:22,219 --> 02:17:25,002
SAM: It's a little jolt. It's a little fall. It's
fine.

2194
02:17:25,002 --> 02:17:29,998
LIAM: That's it. He created this idea and he's
backing out.

2195
02:17:29,998 --> 02:17:37,126
SAM: You told us your famous phrase: all risk!
That's what this is.

2196
02:17:37,126 --> 02:17:43,964
TRAVIS: I do hate to have my own words used
against me.

2197
02:17:43,964 --> 02:17:49,854
SAM: All risk. That's what this is! We are
doing all risk!

2198
02:17:49,854 --> 02:17:57,471
TRAVIS: I'm down to party. I'm just saying it was
a little different in my head.

2199
02:17:57,471 --> 02:18:00,403
SAM: I've never known you to be a coward, Grog.

2200
02:18:00,403 --> 02:18:06,385
TALIESIN: No! Why would you do that?!

2201
02:18:06,385 --> 02:18:07,635
LAURA: Why, Scanlan?!

2202
02:18:07,635 --> 02:18:11,375
TRAVIS: I'll go first. You hold my hand, and I'll
go first.

2203
02:18:11,375 --> 02:18:14,640
LIAM: He can play the fiddle very well.

2204
02:18:14,640 --> 02:18:16,766
TRAVIS: I'll go. Let's do it. I'm ready.

2205
02:18:16,766 --> 02:18:22,453
LAURA: Okay, before we go through, I'm going to
cast Pass Without a Trace on us so we can stealth

2206
02:18:22,453 --> 02:18:24,738
through the tree. Like that's going to work.

2207
02:18:24,738 --> 02:18:26,401
TALIESIN: No, that's a good idea.

2208
02:18:26,401 --> 02:18:30,286
LAURA: I'm going to look for something very solid.
Are there trees around us that we can go through

2209
02:18:30,286 --> 02:18:31,322
right now?

2210
02:18:31,322 --> 02:18:33,698
MATT: A short walk, you could get down to the base
of the forest.

2211
02:18:33,698 --> 02:18:38,669
LAURA: All right. I'm going to tie the rope off
onto a very sturdy thing next to a tree that

2212
02:18:38,669 --> 02:18:40,345
we're going to go through.

2213
02:18:40,345 --> 02:18:41,628
TALIESIN: We're going to rappel.

2214
02:18:41,628 --> 02:18:42,723
LAURA: Yes.

2215
02:18:42,723 --> 02:18:45,769
TRAVIS: Does the portal only close after a
couple seconds?

2216
02:18:45,826 --> 02:18:49,532
TALIESIN: Yes. Six seconds. We're all going to
hold on to the rope and we all go.

2217
02:18:49,532 --> 02:18:51,866
MATT: Six seconds for all of you to--

2218
02:18:51,866 --> 02:18:53,668
LAURA: Jump out!

2219
02:18:53,668 --> 02:18:55,898
MARISHA: Bungee-jumping out of a tree!

2220
02:18:55,898 --> 02:18:57,423
LIAM: We are fucking idiots!

2221
02:18:57,423 --> 02:18:58,620
MARISHA: This is the stupidest--

2222
02:18:58,620 --> 02:19:04,273
TALIESIN: This is a terrible plan. I want to go on
record for saying I was against this plan--

2223
02:19:04,273 --> 02:19:10,155
SAM: We can just leave really quick! She's got
another teleport, yeah. We're going to climb up to

2224
02:19:10,155 --> 02:19:11,367
the tree--

2225
02:19:11,367 --> 02:19:19,029
MARISHA: I didn't see Draconia. I saw the ravine,
and it was snowy, so we can assume it's nearby.

2226
02:19:19,029 --> 02:19:21,975
But I didn't see Draconia, did I?

2227
02:19:21,975 --> 02:19:24,248
MATT: You've never seen Draconia before.

2228
02:19:24,248 --> 02:19:26,024
MARISHA: But did I see a city in my scry?

2229
02:19:26,024 --> 02:19:27,330
MATT: You saw no city.

2230
02:19:27,330 --> 02:19:28,600
LAURA: You saw rubble.

2231
02:19:28,600 --> 02:19:31,997
MARISHA: Once again, Lockheed could have flown
miles away.

2232
02:19:31,997 --> 02:19:33,213
TALIESIN: He could have.

2233
02:19:33,213 --> 02:19:39,331
SAM: At the worst, this is a quick recon mission.
We jump back in the tree, we come back. 15

2234
02:19:39,391 --> 02:19:40,393
minutes.

2235
02:19:40,393 --> 02:19:43,171
LAURA: But there's things that were crawling
around amongst the dead.

2236
02:19:43,171 --> 02:19:45,214
SAM: They were far off in the distance!

2237
02:19:45,275 --> 02:19:50,359
TALIESIN: They weren't that far off. But to be fair,
this is what a plan is, is everything going wrong.

2238
02:19:50,359 --> 02:19:53,785
So I'm all right with doing this, if we're doing
this.

2239
02:19:53,785 --> 02:19:55,124
TRAVIS: All right, sweet. I am, too.

2240
02:19:55,124 --> 02:19:58,067
MARISHA: All right, fuck it! Let's do it.

2241
02:19:58,067 --> 02:20:05,506
MATT: All right. So you've affixed the rope at the
base of the strongest tree you can find.

2242
02:20:05,506 --> 02:20:09,925
MARISHA: Are we going to tie ourselves to each
other again, like before?

2243
02:20:09,925 --> 02:20:13,820
LAURA: No! Because that's dumb. We're going to
break our backs. I'm going to cast Pass Without a

2244
02:20:13,820 --> 02:20:16,903
Trace on everyone right now because why the fuck
not?

2245
02:20:16,903 --> 02:20:19,760
SAM: You got a fucking broom. I'm hopping on the
broom.

2246
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:21,883
LAURA: Oh yeah, I'm on the broom. And he's on the
broom.

2247
02:20:21,947 --> 02:20:24,462
TALIESIN: Vex, we're going to have the greatest
I-told-you-so if we survive this.

2248
02:20:24,462 --> 02:20:27,968
MATT: All right. We have Vex and Scanlan on the
broom.

2249
02:20:28,035 --> 02:20:30,821
TRAVIS: Should you make me some something teensy?

2250
02:20:30,821 --> 02:20:32,973
MARISHA: Oh, this is such a stupid idea...

2251
02:20:32,973 --> 02:20:36,216
TALIESIN: No, we're going to need every spell we
need in there. No, you're the weight that's going

2252
02:20:36,216 --> 02:20:37,988
to hold the rope down, you're going first.

2253
02:20:37,988 --> 02:20:39,517
MATT: Any of your spell prep?

2254
02:20:39,517 --> 02:20:43,885
LIAM: I'm going to pop my wings out and hook my
arms under Kiki's armpits.

2255
02:20:43,953 --> 02:20:45,338
MATT: Okay.

2256
02:20:45,338 --> 02:20:48,150
TALIESIN: I'm holding on the rope, because I'm an
idiot.

2257
02:20:48,150 --> 02:20:51,805
MATT: All right. Grog and Percy holding onto the
rope.

2258
02:20:51,805 --> 02:20:55,513
MARISHA: This is stupid. This is so stupid!

2259
02:20:55,513 --> 02:20:56,709
TALIESIN: I hate you all.

2260
02:20:56,709 --> 02:20:59,770
MARISHA: We've done so many fucking stupid things.
But this is really stupid.

2261
02:20:59,770 --> 02:21:06,011
MATT: Vex casts Pass Without a Trace. The shadows
reach around and embrace your forms. You become more

2262
02:21:06,011 --> 02:21:10,133
obscured the further the light is from your body.
Keyleth, what are you doing?

2263
02:21:10,201 --> 02:21:15,767
MARISHA: I cast Transport Via Plants on that big,
fatty tree!

2264
02:21:15,767 --> 02:21:20,406
MATT: Keyleth touches the edge of the tree, the
rope which is affixed to above. The trunk (portal opens).

2265
02:21:20,406 --> 02:21:21,704
MARISHA: Everyone ready?

2266
02:21:21,704 --> 02:21:23,132
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Go!

2267
02:21:23,132 --> 02:21:24,858
LAURA: I fly through stealthily.

2268
02:21:24,858 --> 02:21:26,415
MATT: You fly through stealthily.

2269
02:21:26,415 --> 02:21:30,439
LAURA: I'm trying to get down to the ground
quickly and hide behind something.

2270
02:21:30,439 --> 02:21:33,515
MATT: Right. I would like all of you guys to make
stealth checks at disadvantage.

2271
02:21:33,515 --> 02:21:37,379
TRAVIS: Yes! That's awesome.

2272
02:21:37,379 --> 02:21:39,177
MARISHA: Oh, that's not too bad.

2273
02:21:39,177 --> 02:21:41,868
TRAVIS: 17!

2274
02:21:41,868 --> 02:21:44,952
SAM: Pass Without a Trace?

2275
02:21:44,952 --> 02:21:48,776
TRAVIS: Oh. 27.

2276
02:21:48,776 --> 02:21:50,048
TALIESIN: 20.

2277
02:21:50,048 --> 02:21:50,873
SAM: 20.

2278
02:21:50,873 --> 02:21:51,675
MARISHA: 22.

2279
02:21:51,675 --> 02:21:52,537
LIAM: 35.

2280
02:21:52,537 --> 02:21:53,417
LAURA: 33.

2281
02:21:53,417 --> 02:21:54,510
TRAVIS: 27.

2282
02:21:54,510 --> 02:22:03,221
MATT: All right. As Vex and Scanlan scoot first
through the opening, you coast down, and there is

2283
02:22:03,221 --> 02:22:07,852
a cluster of rocks, but there's a light snowdust,
and you find a snowbank that you guys coast down

2284
02:22:07,852 --> 02:22:11,381
to quickly. You can decide to float above the
snowbank. What do you want to do?

2285
02:22:11,381 --> 02:22:14,290
LAURA: We get down on the ground and go under.

2286
02:22:14,290 --> 02:22:20,510
MATT: Okay, so you disappear under the snowbank. It is
freezing cold, the wet immediately falling snow

2287
02:22:20,510 --> 02:22:26,277
against your form begins to seep in. But you are
below eye-level. Vax and Keyleth? You guys just

2288
02:22:26,277 --> 02:22:28,100
dart through, you holding her.

2289
02:22:28,100 --> 02:22:32,880
LIAM: Fly through, and then once I see them hit
the ground, I'm going to dive-bomb us, and I'm

2290
02:22:32,880 --> 02:22:37,252
going to wrap us in a little wing bubble and roll
into the snow.

2291
02:22:37,252 --> 02:22:44,412
MATT: All right. As you guys come falling out the
side of the tree, you see nearby as a small,

2292
02:22:44,412 --> 02:22:53,870
green tiny dragon gets startled and flies off. You
guys go coasting, the wings expand for a second.

2293
02:22:53,870 --> 02:23:01,766
It picks up and as you hit, whipping past the 15 feet
of jagged rocks that were gathered at the

2294
02:23:01,766 --> 02:23:07,107
base of the ravine, you scoot over it, the wings
fold in around you, and you guys tumble into the

2295
02:23:07,107 --> 02:23:11,259
snow. Make an acrobatics check with disadvantage
because you're grabbing onto her and are

2296
02:23:11,259 --> 02:23:12,775
covered in wings.

2297
02:23:12,775 --> 02:23:14,228
LAURA: And you're covered in wings.

2298
02:23:14,228 --> 02:23:17,414
LIAM: I rolled a 15 and a 20. That would be a 30.

2299
02:23:17,414 --> 02:23:25,683
MATT: You don't feel the pain. And the wings do
cause a significant barrier of impact, as well as

2300
02:23:25,683 --> 02:23:30,882
the snow. As soon as you land, you go into a
classic shoulder roll and use the inertia to not

2301
02:23:30,882 --> 02:23:35,381
arise above the water. You both essentially coast
sideways, stopping within the snowbank. From an

2302
02:23:35,381 --> 02:23:40,615
overhead perspective, you can see a large swath
has been carved through. But from visual eye

2303
02:23:40,615 --> 02:23:43,786
range, at equal level, you guys still appear to be
hidden within the snow.

2304
02:23:43,853 --> 02:23:50,972
The two of you jump through and start rappelling
down, Grog at the bottom end. Bringing the rope,

2305
02:23:50,972 --> 02:23:58,445
bringing the rope down, bringing the rope down. It
slams shuts, the rope cuts at the other end as the

2306
02:23:58,445 --> 02:24:04,501
portal closes. Percy, you just make it out as
the rope gives way. It is now Grog and Percy

2307
02:24:04,501 --> 02:24:06,334
plummeting toward the ground.

2308
02:24:06,334 --> 02:24:08,958
MARISHA: I cast a Grasping Vine to grab Grog.

2309
02:24:08,958 --> 02:24:12,594
MATT: You don't have the opportunity, because this
all happens in a period of six seconds and you

2310
02:24:12,594 --> 02:24:14,683
guys just landed and coasted in the snow.

2311
02:24:14,683 --> 02:24:16,147
TRAVIS: Am I right under Percy?

2312
02:24:16,147 --> 02:24:18,452
MATT: He's about five feet ahead of you, yeah.

2313
02:24:18,452 --> 02:24:20,032
TRAVIS: (laughs)

2314
02:24:20,032 --> 02:24:23,821
TALIESIN: I'm going to let that happen.

2315
02:24:23,821 --> 02:24:27,457
MATT: You're cushioning his fall?

2316
02:24:27,457 --> 02:24:28,486
TRAVIS: Yep.

2317
02:24:28,486 --> 02:24:33,882
MATT: All right. Make an acrobatics check, just
for the hell of it.

2318
02:24:33,882 --> 02:24:37,528
LIAM: I love this game.

2319
02:24:37,528 --> 02:24:38,793
TRAVIS: 13.

2320
02:24:38,793 --> 02:24:44,238
MATT: 13. As soon as you look over your shoulder
and see the ground coming, you try and swing your

2321
02:24:44,238 --> 02:24:48,934
legs underneath to catch you, to slide across. And
you begin to. Your feet catch the rock and you

2322
02:24:48,934 --> 02:24:55,129
feel the muscles tense. Your back gets jammed a
little bit. And you catch Percy in your arms, but

2323
02:24:55,129 --> 02:25:02,265
the momentum of Percy hitting you sends you back
over, and you both tumble into the snow. You do

2324
02:25:02,265 --> 02:25:07,784
prevent Percy from taking any damage, but you do
suffer five points of fall damage.

2325
02:25:07,784 --> 02:25:10,050
LIAM: Stubbed your toe, big guy?

2326
02:25:10,050 --> 02:25:12,354
TRAVIS: I got a booby.

2327
02:25:12,354 --> 02:25:16,484
SAM: Is Lockheed within range still? Can we see
him?

2328
02:25:16,484 --> 02:25:18,586
MATT: You guys make a perception check.

2329
02:25:18,586 --> 02:25:21,429
MARISHA: Can I look, too?

2330
02:25:21,429 --> 02:25:24,116
MATT: You're just now getting
up out of the ball of wings.

2331
02:25:24,116 --> 02:25:25,256
LAURA: 25.

2332
02:25:25,256 --> 02:25:26,273
SAM: Six.

2333
02:25:26,273 --> 02:25:27,221
LAURA: 25.

2334
02:25:27,221 --> 02:25:32,373
MATT: 25. You do see Lockheed is about 50, 60 feet
up on the rock right now.

2335
02:25:32,373 --> 02:25:34,669
SAM: Where's Lockheed?

2336
02:25:34,669 --> 02:25:45,862
LAURA: Can I whisper in Draconic? Lockheed! And
whatever the word is for "Come to me."

2337
02:25:45,862 --> 02:25:49,512
MATT: Seems too far to really be within earshot of
a whisper.

2338
02:25:49,512 --> 02:25:59,014
SAM: I see her doing this. I point to him, and I
cast Message, and I say: Lockheed! We're down

2339
02:25:59,014 --> 02:26:01,646
here! Come down! It's us, your friends!

2340
02:26:01,646 --> 02:26:18,191
MATT: Lockheed (wingbeats) and then glides against
the rock. And glides lower to the rock. Glides

2341
02:26:18,191 --> 02:26:27,359
lower to the rock, and flies up-- still keeping a
cautious distance from you above the snow.

2342
02:26:27,359 --> 02:26:34,097
LIAM: Tibs. We're friends with Tibs. Tiberius. You
remember us?

2343
02:26:34,097 --> 02:26:40,821
MATT: You can see Lockheed a little closer
now. You remember him being fairly sick when he was

2344
02:26:40,821 --> 02:26:45,721
initially purchased. While the illness has passed,
he looks greatly malnourished and thin--

2345
02:26:45,721 --> 02:26:49,569
LAURA: I pull out some of my food that I give to
Trinket and try to feed it...

2346
02:26:49,569 --> 02:26:52,877
MATT: As soon as you pull out the food, Lockheed's
demeanor changes immediately. Darts up and almost

2347
02:26:52,877 --> 02:26:54,985
latches onto your hand and causes you to jump--

2348
02:26:54,985 --> 02:26:58,226
LAURA: I cast Speak With Animals. Is he an
animal?

2349
02:26:58,226 --> 02:26:59,343
MATT: Nope.

2350
02:26:59,343 --> 02:27:01,177
SAM: I have Speak With Small Beasts...

2351
02:27:01,177 --> 02:27:02,582
MATT: Not a beast.

2352
02:27:02,582 --> 02:27:03,782
SAM: Fuck you!

2353
02:27:03,782 --> 02:27:06,375
(laughter)

2354
02:27:06,375 --> 02:27:08,253
LIAM: He's a little small monster.

2355
02:27:08,253 --> 02:27:13,856
LAURA: I would have known, as a dragon expert,
that he's not a fucking animal, then. Whatever.

2356
02:27:13,856 --> 02:27:16,855
SAM: What is a monster?

2357
02:27:16,855 --> 02:27:18,786
TALIESIN: Hit your head in the fall.

2358
02:27:18,786 --> 02:27:20,869
LAURA: I didn't fall, I flew.

2359
02:27:20,869 --> 02:27:23,397
TRAVIS: Pike's a small monster.

2360
02:27:23,397 --> 02:27:28,350
SAM: Just grab him and put him in the bag of
holding!

2361
02:27:28,350 --> 02:27:37,679
MATT: At this point now, the temperature's really
set into you. You've heard stories. You're

2362
02:27:37,679 --> 02:27:52,200
familiar with the sound. The words you've heard of
Wildemount, being largely a colder continent,

2363
02:27:52,200 --> 02:27:59,239
especially to the north where the actual
civilizations of man exist. Draconia's a little

2364
02:27:59,239 --> 02:28:04,929
further to the south, but also based on the
information you have, this being taken recently as

2365
02:28:04,929 --> 02:28:14,199
the den of Vorugal, there is an almost perpetual
small snowstorm that is existing about this

2366
02:28:14,199 --> 02:28:21,770
ravine, and the wind itself is beginning to cut
through. Thankfully, you're mostly armored up. For

2367
02:28:21,770 --> 02:28:27,170
the time being, you're fine. But you can see where
this is a difficult weather pattern to perpetually

2368
02:28:27,170 --> 02:28:32,353
live in. Lockheed finishes eating vigorously and
seems to be waiting across your hand.

2369
02:28:32,353 --> 02:28:36,298
LAURA: Perch him on my shoulder and get out some
more of the little boar meat we have in the bag of

2370
02:28:36,298 --> 02:28:38,579
colding and feeding him.

2371
02:28:38,579 --> 02:28:40,585
MATT: He eats some, happily.

2372
02:28:40,585 --> 02:28:46,300
LAURA: Can I speak Draconic to him, see if he
understands any of that?

2373
02:28:46,300 --> 02:28:47,811
MATT: What do you say?

2374
02:28:47,811 --> 02:28:49,815
LIAM: Tiberius was teaching him Draconic.

2375
02:28:49,815 --> 02:28:57,153
LAURA: Yeah, I know. I say "Where is Tiberius?" in
Draconic.

2376
02:28:57,153 --> 02:29:00,120
LIAM: Where is home?

2377
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:01,773
LAURA: Where is home?

2378
02:29:01,773 --> 02:29:04,473
MATT: (croaking)

2379
02:29:04,473 --> 02:29:07,673
LIAM: Unless Tibs got further along with him, it
was one word--

2380
02:29:07,673 --> 02:29:11,396
SAM: He was teaching him "sit" and "play dead" and
stuff.

2381
02:29:11,396 --> 02:29:12,978
LIAM: One word at a time.

2382
02:29:12,978 --> 02:29:14,853
LAURA: All right. Stay.

2383
02:29:14,853 --> 02:29:22,590
MATT: And stays and digs in the talons at the top
of your leather armor shoulder, folds thed wings in

2384
02:29:22,590 --> 02:29:26,564
and just waits there, huddled up against 
your shoulder for warmth.

2385
02:29:26,564 --> 02:29:29,513
TALIESIN: I'm going to look around and see if
there's a direction in which it seems there's

2386
02:29:29,513 --> 02:29:32,169
civilization or any signs of battle or otherwise.

2387
02:29:32,238 --> 02:29:35,060
MATT: Make a perception check.

2388
02:29:35,060 --> 02:29:37,386
TALIESIN: 16.

2389
02:29:37,386 --> 02:29:43,733
MATT: 16. You bring your head above the snowline
and you can see surrounding you-- and you are in

2390
02:29:43,733 --> 02:29:49,364
the center of this giant ravine that opens up to
the sky. Not quite Grand Canyon size, but it's

2391
02:29:49,364 --> 02:29:56,202
about half the width. It's a wide gulf. And you
guys are on one side of where the ravine slowly

2392
02:29:56,202 --> 02:30:00,967
begins to coalesce, and there's various steps in
which the ravine casts down. You were already

2393
02:30:00,967 --> 02:30:03,805
towards the bottom when you landed. This could
have been a lot worse were it higher up.

2394
02:30:03,805 --> 02:30:15,121
Looking up, you see, just from this vantage point,
dozens of large stacks of broken rock and stone.

2395
02:30:15,121 --> 02:30:21,634
You see pillars that are jutting out of portions
of this. You see partially and mostly collapsed

2396
02:30:21,634 --> 02:30:28,811
buildings that themselves have been destroyed from
serious impact. You recall, during the initial

2397
02:30:28,811 --> 02:30:34,197
attack of the Conclave, that one of the things
that was seen through a vision was the fall of

2398
02:30:34,197 --> 02:30:40,820
Draconia, which were islands of stone that were
held aloft through arcane means within this

2399
02:30:40,820 --> 02:30:46,783
ravine. What you now look upon are all the fallen
remains of each of these arcane islands now

2400
02:30:46,783 --> 02:30:54,526
plummeted, crushed, and fell into the ravine and
have been sundered and destroyed. You do see

2401
02:30:54,526 --> 02:30:59,753
figures moving quickly and crawling over elements
of it, and you see a cluster of them fighting over

2402
02:30:59,753 --> 02:31:01,368
something and then disperse.

2403
02:31:01,368 --> 02:31:02,637
LIAM: How far off?

2404
02:31:02,637 --> 02:31:04,292
MATT: They're probably a good 300 feet off.

2405
02:31:04,292 --> 02:31:06,520
LAURA: Could we tell what kind of creatures they
are?

2406
02:31:06,520 --> 02:31:11,987
MATT: They appear to be humanoid, somewhat
reptilian.

2407
02:31:11,987 --> 02:31:14,958
SAM: Should I make us lizard people?

2408
02:31:14,958 --> 02:31:22,751
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see if I can
see the origin, the epicenter of the storm? Like

2409
02:31:22,751 --> 02:31:25,365
the eye of the storm? Where it's coming from?

2410
02:31:25,365 --> 02:31:26,895
TALIESIN: Clever.

2411
02:31:26,895 --> 02:31:33,170
MARISHA: 16.

2412
02:31:33,170 --> 02:31:42,756
MATT: 16. Best that you can view, the storm seems
to be slowly spiraling, and a large heavy portion

2413
02:31:42,756 --> 02:31:51,874
of the snowfall and sleet is hitting about a mile
or so towards the right side of the ravine that

2414
02:31:51,874 --> 02:31:55,157
you guys are looking at. From the wall you're at,
you have the right and the left sides of this

2415
02:31:55,157 --> 02:31:59,383
current ravine structure, seems to be that
direction, about a mile.

2416
02:31:59,383 --> 02:32:01,647
MARISHA: I think the dragon's lair is that way.

2417
02:32:01,647 --> 02:32:05,679
SAM: Can you look around for more trees that
aren't so hard to get to in case we need to make a

2418
02:32:05,679 --> 02:32:06,930
fast getaway?

2419
02:32:06,930 --> 02:32:08,233
TALIESIN: We could just keep our eyes open.

2420
02:32:08,233 --> 02:32:09,607
SAM: All right.

2421
02:32:09,607 --> 02:32:14,735
MARISHA: You said it was a mile. Can we traverse
through the bottom of the ravine to get there in

2422
02:32:14,735 --> 02:32:15,860
that direction?

2423
02:32:15,860 --> 02:32:17,117
SAM: Or is it all water?

2424
02:32:17,117 --> 02:32:18,340
MATT: No, you can.

2425
02:32:18,340 --> 02:32:24,847
TRAVIS: We're going to crack out the good old Dust
of Tracelessness since there's knee-high snow?

2426
02:32:24,847 --> 02:32:32,200
TALIESIN: Let's not be fleshy.

2427
02:32:32,200 --> 02:32:37,173
SAM: You want me to make us Draconians or lizard
people?

2428
02:32:37,173 --> 02:32:40,562
TALIESIN: If we're lizard people, Draconians will
not trust us.

2429
02:32:40,562 --> 02:32:43,844
LIAM: Yeah. We can at least pretend to cower and
be afraid of lizard men if we see them.

2430
02:32:43,844 --> 02:32:45,750
SAM: I don't think Grog can cower.

2431
02:32:45,750 --> 02:32:48,434
TRAVIS: What is the definition of this word?

2432
02:32:48,434 --> 02:32:50,591
SAM: Be a wussy.

2433
02:32:50,591 --> 02:32:52,520
TALIESIN: Shaky dance.

2434
02:32:52,520 --> 02:32:55,074
(laughter)

2435
02:32:55,074 --> 02:33:05,323
LIAM: You know when you bang your balls on a rock
or something? It's like that, you go, (groans).

2436
02:33:05,323 --> 02:33:19,483
TALIESIN: Is there anything you're not good at?
Don't think that hard. Never mind.

2437
02:33:19,483 --> 02:33:25,353
SAM: Draconians?

2438
02:33:25,353 --> 02:33:26,896
TALIESIN: Draconians.

2439
02:33:26,896 --> 02:33:32,624
SAM: I will cast Seeming on the party and make us
all Draconians.

2440
02:33:32,624 --> 02:33:38,455
MATT: What kind of Draconians? There are many
types of colors, there are those with and without tails--

2441
02:33:38,455 --> 02:33:39,927
SAM: Wasn't Tiberius a strange one?

2442
02:33:39,927 --> 02:33:41,215
LAURA: Don't do red!

2443
02:33:41,215 --> 02:33:42,482
SAM: He was a strange one, right?

2444
02:33:42,482 --> 02:33:45,074
MARISHA: He was the odd man out.

2445
02:33:45,074 --> 02:33:47,219
LIAM: They didn't take kindly to him.

2446
02:33:47,219 --> 02:33:49,851
SAM: Metallic, yeah?

2447
02:33:49,851 --> 02:33:51,246
LIAM: Bronze?

2448
02:33:51,246 --> 02:33:54,211
SAM: Like gray, silver?

2449
02:33:54,211 --> 02:33:58,798
LAURA: Maybe it's good to make us silvers and
whiteish!

2450
02:33:58,798 --> 02:34:07,606
SAM: Bronze, silver, and gold then, I guess.

2451
02:34:07,606 --> 02:34:10,225
LIAM: That's chromatic. Metallic! Bronze, silver,
gold.

2452
02:34:10,225 --> 02:34:11,906
SAM: Yeah, we'll do the Olympics.

2453
02:34:11,906 --> 02:34:15,752
MATT: With or without tail? Because you've met
both.

2454
02:34:15,752 --> 02:34:19,569
TALIESIN: They won't actually be tails. That might
actually get us in trouble.

2455
02:34:19,569 --> 02:34:21,283
SAM: Which one was Tiberius?

2456
02:34:21,283 --> 02:34:22,792
MATT: Tiberius had a tail.

2457
02:34:22,792 --> 02:34:24,420
SAM: Do most of them have a tail?

2458
02:34:24,420 --> 02:34:27,611
LAURA: Gern didn't have a tail and he was less
than-- I don't think Draconians will like us

2459
02:34:27,611 --> 02:34:28,986
without a tail.

2460
02:34:28,986 --> 02:34:31,403
SAM: We all have tails. Mine's a little longer
than the rest.

2461
02:34:31,403 --> 02:34:35,317
(laughter)

2462
02:34:35,317 --> 02:34:40,333
MATT: Keeping your normal attire, just on the top
of the Draconian form?

2463
02:34:40,333 --> 02:34:43,625
SAM: No! What do Draconians wear?

2464
02:34:43,625 --> 02:34:45,938
LAURA: Rags! Put us in rags, like we've been
living in rubble.

2465
02:34:45,938 --> 02:34:52,626
SAM: Raw silk and tattered clothes, just rags,
terrible gray things.

2466
02:34:52,626 --> 02:34:57,585
LAURA: Make us look like we've been beat up.

2467
02:34:57,585 --> 02:35:02,850
SAM: Sure. We all have a single bruise.

2468
02:35:02,850 --> 02:35:05,044
(laughter)

2469
02:35:05,044 --> 02:35:12,858
SAM: In a different place on our face. Everyone's
got one face bruise in a different place.

2470
02:35:12,858 --> 02:35:23,545
MATT: All of your forms shift into that of various
metallic dragonborn, with tails, adorned in rags,

2471
02:35:23,545 --> 02:35:26,153
dirty. What do you do?

2472
02:35:26,153 --> 02:35:28,364
LAURA: Oh shit, who all speaks Draconic here?

2473
02:35:28,364 --> 02:35:29,904
SAM: You speak Draconic!

2474
02:35:29,904 --> 02:35:33,934
(laughter)

2475
02:35:33,934 --> 02:35:39,911
SAM: We're all mutes. We're lepers and mutes, and
you are our doctor?

2476
02:35:39,911 --> 02:35:43,850
LIAM: Everybody else does fearful anime reacts the
whole time.

2477
02:35:43,850 --> 02:35:47,323
(gasping)

2478
02:35:47,323 --> 02:35:50,464
TRAVIS: (speaking in Japanese)

2479
02:35:50,464 --> 02:35:52,630
LAURA: Don't actually speak Japanese, Grog.

2480
02:35:52,630 --> 02:36:04,493
TALIESIN: We're moving towards the epicenter.

2481
02:36:04,493 --> 02:36:09,690
MATT: You guys step up out of the snow and begin
walking?

2482
02:36:09,690 --> 02:36:12,409
MARISHA: Stealthily.

2483
02:36:12,409 --> 02:36:19,799
LAURA: Okay, I'm stealthily leading us. That
direction, towards where the lair is?

2484
02:36:19,799 --> 02:36:21,691
TRAVIS: Keeping an eye out for trees.

2485
02:36:21,691 --> 02:36:25,814
LAURA: And for any of the lizard creatures coming
towards us.

2486
02:36:25,814 --> 02:36:27,465
MATT: Right now, no.

2487
02:36:27,465 --> 02:36:31,955
LAURA: Then let's quietly make our way that
direction.

2488
02:36:31,955 --> 02:36:34,412
LIAM: Remember, like you've been hit in the
balls.

2489
02:36:34,412 --> 02:36:36,503
TRAVIS: <i>Oh.</i>

2490
02:36:36,503 --> 02:36:41,799
MATT: You guys cluster up and begin stepping above
the snow, which is still about waist, knee-high

2491
02:36:41,799 --> 02:36:48,259
for some of you. Making your way to the right of
your current location, towards the center of the

2492
02:36:48,259 --> 02:36:56,602
storm that Keyleth discovered. As you guys begin
to walk, a nearby pile of rock and rubble, there

2493
02:36:56,602 --> 02:37:03,117
was that one cluster of four, five of these moving
lizard-like entities. Suddenly, one of them looks

2494
02:37:03,117 --> 02:37:07,175
at your group, looks back at the rest, and they
all stand up and look over in your direction.

2495
02:37:07,175 --> 02:37:15,766
SAM: You're our leader, friend. Do we continue?

2496
02:37:15,766 --> 02:37:18,734
MATT: They're just watching you. They're not doing
anything.

2497
02:37:18,734 --> 02:37:22,968
LAURA: Let's injuredly keep walking.

2498
02:37:22,968 --> 02:37:35,041
MATT: They go back to rummaging through. You guys
continue to walk. The ravine curves to the right,

2499
02:37:35,041 --> 02:37:41,145
or at least begins to open up further to the right
and you're met with the next large structure of

2500
02:37:41,145 --> 02:37:49,747
rubble. What you saw was the edge of an extremely
large, once-floating island, now crushed and

2501
02:37:49,747 --> 02:37:55,643
sundered across the ground. There are sheets of
ice across parts of it. You can see the better

2502
02:37:55,643 --> 02:38:02,043
part of a large palace or library that is now
caved in partially. You can see frozen books

2503
02:38:02,043 --> 02:38:07,841
scattered across portions of the stone and rock on
the ground before you. You can see a series of

2504
02:38:07,841 --> 02:38:13,006
huts have been constructed on top of this rubble,
and there are some small fires lit, little plumes

2505
02:38:13,006 --> 02:38:19,958
of smoke and probably two dozen dragonborn figures
that are currently combing through the rubble.

2506
02:38:19,958 --> 02:38:23,105
LAURA: Do we see any books that seem interesting
as we're walking through them?

2507
02:38:23,105 --> 02:38:27,320
MATT: They're underneath ice. You can try and
chisel some out, if you like.

2508
02:38:27,320 --> 02:38:29,426
LIAM: Don't have time!

2509
02:38:29,426 --> 02:38:35,904
MATT: A lot of it's covered in snow. There's some
bits you can peek through and see sheets of ice

2510
02:38:35,904 --> 02:38:37,022
and frozen books--

2511
02:38:37,022 --> 02:38:42,202
TRAVIS: Are there any frozen bodies?

2512
02:38:42,202 --> 02:38:48,054
MATT: As you begin to have a closer book as you
walk by, there are many frozen bodies. You see

2513
02:38:48,054 --> 02:38:58,797
many people, all dragonborn, some atop the rubble,
some partially crushed, some partially locked in

2514
02:38:58,797 --> 02:39:07,424
ice, some destroyed by some sort of an acidic
substance. Some of them are covered in boils, and

2515
02:39:07,424 --> 02:39:19,476
their face is locked in some sort of horrible
coughing fit. This was a very terrifying battle

2516
02:39:19,476 --> 02:39:21,216
scene that has transpired here.

2517
02:39:21,216 --> 02:39:22,856
LAURA: That means Raishan was here.

2518
02:39:22,856 --> 02:39:24,636
MARISHA: That means Thordak was here.

2519
02:39:24,636 --> 02:39:26,519
LIAM: Umbrasyl was here. Acid.

2520
02:39:26,519 --> 02:39:28,410
MARISHA: They attacked the cities as a horde.

2521
02:39:28,410 --> 02:39:30,103
MATT: There are no signs of anyone burned.

2522
02:39:30,103 --> 02:39:32,173
MARISHA: I thought you said ash.

2523
02:39:32,173 --> 02:39:38,577
LAURA: The people that are scouring through the
rubble, are those dragonborn or just the lizard

2524
02:39:38,577 --> 02:39:39,668
people?

2525
02:39:39,668 --> 02:39:42,513
MATT: Best that you can tell right now, it appears
to be dragonborn.

2526
02:39:42,513 --> 02:39:46,244
LAURA: Can we look at their behavior and see what
it looks like they're doing?

2527
02:39:46,244 --> 02:39:48,374
MATT: Make an insight check.

2528
02:39:48,374 --> 02:39:50,654
TALIESIN: I would like to join that insight
check.

2529
02:39:50,654 --> 02:39:52,739
SAM: I would not like to.

2530
02:39:52,739 --> 02:39:56,423
TALIESIN: Nine.

2531
02:39:56,423 --> 02:39:57,993
LIAM: Nine.

2532
02:39:57,993 --> 02:40:00,167
SAM: I will join that insight check.

2533
02:40:00,167 --> 02:40:01,453
MARISHA: I'll join in, too.

2534
02:40:01,453 --> 02:40:02,747
MATT: You've already said no.

2535
02:40:02,747 --> 02:40:07,013
LAURA: 13. This isn't having to do with dragons?
So it's 13.

2536
02:40:07,013 --> 02:40:15,624
MARISHA: I don't do insight checks too often, I'm
sorry. 22.

2537
02:40:15,624 --> 02:40:18,395
MATT: Did you roll or not?

2538
02:40:18,395 --> 02:40:19,773
TRAVIS: Oh, I rolled a ten.

2539
02:40:19,773 --> 02:40:26,493
MATT: Best you can tell, they're surviving.
They're scouring through the ruins, trying to find

2540
02:40:26,493 --> 02:40:31,588
anything of worth. Some of it's finding wood and
throwing it onto these little flame pyres that are

2541
02:40:31,588 --> 02:40:36,863
scattered around the ruins. You begin to look and
see that actually the sides of the ravine, there

2542
02:40:36,863 --> 02:40:47,243
are hundreds of small caverns are carved into the
rock. Not quite like a dense honeycomb style, but

2543
02:40:47,243 --> 02:40:51,161
it looks like there is an entire cave city that
lives within this ravine.

2544
02:40:51,161 --> 02:40:53,581
LIAM: And they're not frozen over?

2545
02:40:53,581 --> 02:40:56,492
MATT: Some of them are covered in snow.

2546
02:40:56,492 --> 02:41:01,116
LIAM: But snow, not blasted with ice?

2547
02:41:01,116 --> 02:41:02,832
TALIESIN: They look like they're in use?

2548
02:41:02,832 --> 02:41:15,417
MATT: Some of these dragonborn, they're coming out
of their huts. Some of them are still looking up

2549
02:41:15,417 --> 02:41:23,488
at the sky nervously. They look over and see you
guys approaching and a voice calls out, "Who goes there?"

2550
02:41:23,488 --> 02:41:32,858
LAURA: Friends. Friends of Stormwinds.

2551
02:41:32,858 --> 02:41:40,449
MATT: "Friends of Stormwind, you say? We have
friends of Stormwind. Approach."

2552
02:41:40,449 --> 02:41:43,738
LAURA: I walk up injuredly.

2553
02:41:43,738 --> 02:41:47,514
LIAM: I'm hobbling up behind.

2554
02:41:47,514 --> 02:41:49,821
TALIESIN: I'm cowering.

2555
02:41:49,821 --> 02:41:56,011
MATT: You guys cower and approach. Keyleth, Vax,
and Vex, you notice as you approach that a number

2556
02:41:56,011 --> 02:42:02,437
of the people that have all stopped and are paying
attention are beginning to move around and

2557
02:42:02,437 --> 02:42:03,978
encircle you.

2558
02:42:03,978 --> 02:42:14,585
LAURA: Pardon my friends, their tongues have been
cut out by our captors. I'm all that's left.

2559
02:42:14,585 --> 02:42:21,685
MATT: As you walk forward you can see the figure
that's talking to you, a very tall, burly,

2560
02:42:21,685 --> 02:42:34,179
bronze-scaled dragonborn, long horns that protrude
down the back in a slow curvature. No tail. In

2561
02:42:34,179 --> 02:42:38,713
fact, you now notice that every single one of the
dragonborn you've noticed here have no tail.

2562
02:42:38,713 --> 02:42:41,198
SAM: We had a 50-50 chance!

2563
02:42:41,198 --> 02:42:51,955
MATT: "Friends of Stormwind. That would make you
Sky-walkers. I see your tails. You survive the

2564
02:42:51,955 --> 02:43:01,187
"onslaught and step into the den of those you
persecuted. Well, what are your last words?"

2565
02:43:01,187 --> 02:43:03,705
SAM: This was a great plan.

2566
02:43:03,705 --> 02:43:09,280
LIAM: Drop it.

2567
02:43:09,280 --> 02:43:12,261
SAM: I don't know what's going on.

2568
02:43:12,261 --> 02:43:14,813
MARISHA: Is this all being said in Draconic?

2569
02:43:14,813 --> 02:43:17,108
SAM: It's Draconian! I don't know what's
happening.

2570
02:43:17,108 --> 02:43:27,966
LAURA: You know what, I don't know what to tell
you. Everyone with a tail's an asshole. We got

2571
02:43:27,966 --> 02:43:30,047
what was coming to us.

2572
02:43:30,047 --> 02:43:33,999
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2573
02:43:33,999 --> 02:43:40,120
TALIESIN: Wow!

2574
02:43:40,120 --> 02:43:43,172
LAURA: 19?

2575
02:43:43,172 --> 02:43:53,956
MATT: He turns his head to the side a bit. (spits)
"What skills do you have?"

2576
02:43:53,956 --> 02:43:58,361
LAURA: I can shoot.

2577
02:43:58,361 --> 02:44:02,685
MATT: "Is that all?"

2578
02:44:02,685 --> 02:44:06,122
LAURA: He makes boots.

2579
02:44:06,122 --> 02:44:08,991
MATT: "That's a skill."

2580
02:44:08,991 --> 02:44:13,844
LAURA: She's really good at stonecraft.

2581
02:44:13,844 --> 02:44:18,743
MATT: All the other dragonborn that come behind
you are now holding spears, some of them

2582
02:44:18,743 --> 02:44:23,843
rudimentary-looking pikes that are just held up
and pointed in your direction. You guys are now

2583
02:44:23,843 --> 02:44:38,803
enclosed by about two dozen dragonborn. "Here are
your choices: You die here like the scum you are--"

2584
02:44:38,803 --> 02:44:42,296
LAURA: Choice B.

2585
02:44:42,296 --> 02:44:44,944
MATT: "Then slavery it is."

2586
02:44:44,944 --> 02:44:56,482
(laughter)

2587
02:44:56,482 --> 02:45:01,699
MATT: "You will join the rest of your ilk, and you
will seek food for us. You will know what it's

2588
02:45:01,699 --> 02:45:09,537
"like to be bent beneath the knee of those who do
not deserve it. Put them in chains!"

2589
02:45:09,537 --> 02:45:14,123
LAURA: Oh, they're going to know, as soon as we're
in chains.

2590
02:45:14,123 --> 02:45:16,291
LIAM: Well, we're going to have a fight here.

2591
02:45:16,291 --> 02:45:19,440
LAURA: Oh, shall we drop Seeming? Perhaps we should
drop Seeming?

2592
02:45:19,440 --> 02:45:21,422
SAM: What? Is it going well?

2593
02:45:21,422 --> 02:45:23,514
LAURA: Wait.

2594
02:45:23,514 --> 02:45:28,395
MATT: They approach, and stop for a second. A few
of the folks who came over and went to grab for

2595
02:45:28,395 --> 02:45:30,507
chains have stopped and are holding them in their
hand.

2596
02:45:30,507 --> 02:45:38,101
LAURA: I have to tell you something. We're not
actually Draconian.

2597
02:45:38,101 --> 02:45:45,134
MATT: He leans in and gives you this very keen
look now, and takes a few steps closer. He's about

2598
02:45:45,134 --> 02:45:54,357
five feet from you now. "From where I stand, you
look pretty fucking Draconian to me."

2599
02:45:54,357 --> 02:46:01,647
LAURA: Well, we have some really good magic users
with us. Look, forgive us for making tails. We

2600
02:46:01,647 --> 02:46:07,256
don't know anything about your culture. We're
idiots! We came here because we know you're under

2601
02:46:07,256 --> 02:46:09,495
attack, and we're trying to help.

2602
02:46:09,495 --> 02:46:18,250
MATT: "And you just wander into the caves of the
Ravenites, dressed in the face of those that broke

2603
02:46:18,250 --> 02:46:19,579
"our backs?"

2604
02:46:19,579 --> 02:46:21,301
LAURA: Yep, because we're stupid!

2605
02:46:21,301 --> 02:46:24,642
MATT: Make a persuasion check with disadvantage.

2606
02:46:24,642 --> 02:46:28,658
SAM: Disadvantage. Not good.

2607
02:46:28,658 --> 02:46:32,107
LAURA: 14?

2608
02:46:32,107 --> 02:46:44,466
MATT: 14? "Bring the chains. You have ten seconds
to prove--"

2609
02:46:44,466 --> 02:46:45,944
LAURA: Drop Seeming, just drop it.

2610
02:46:45,944 --> 02:46:48,141
SAM: Really? It's one of my better spells.

2611
02:46:48,141 --> 02:46:49,410
LAURA: I know, I'm sorry!

2612
02:46:49,410 --> 02:46:52,579
SAM: All right, poof. We're back to normal.

2613
02:46:52,579 --> 02:46:58,139
MATT: All of your images fade. Everyone takes a
step back. The spears come up even further, and

2614
02:46:58,139 --> 02:46:59,537
there's a little pause.

2615
02:46:59,537 --> 02:47:01,625
MARISHA: My tail's gone! Bummer.

2616
02:47:01,625 --> 02:47:03,774
LAURA: No, believe me, you don't want the tail.

2617
02:47:03,774 --> 02:47:05,522
MARISHA: But I enjoyed it.

2618
02:47:05,522 --> 02:47:11,000
LIAM: Does this make things better or worse for
us?

2619
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,370
LAURA: I repeat him.

2620
02:47:13,370 --> 02:47:20,466
MATT: Yeah, the reactions you get from them, you
gather most of these don't speak Common and none

2621
02:47:20,466 --> 02:47:22,143
of them seem to understand what you're saying.

2622
02:47:22,143 --> 02:47:29,412
LAURA: Here's the thing. You're being attacked by
a white dragon.

2623
02:47:29,412 --> 02:47:33,368
MATT: "The white dragon came, and he tore down the
Sky-walkers."

2624
02:47:33,368 --> 02:47:35,401
LAURA: So you're happy with it?

2625
02:47:35,401 --> 02:47:40,108
MATT: "Well, it's put us in a better position."

2626
02:47:40,108 --> 02:47:48,772
LAURA: Right. But now that the Sky-walkers have
already been torn down, do you want to keep the

2627
02:47:48,772 --> 02:47:50,625
dragon in charge?

2628
02:47:50,625 --> 02:48:00,888
MATT: "We owe the dragon for the freedom that he
gave us."

2629
02:48:00,888 --> 02:48:07,597
LAURA: So you serve one.

2630
02:48:07,597 --> 02:48:10,028
MATT: "For the time."

2631
02:48:10,028 --> 02:48:15,885
LAURA: And he doesn't punish you at all? He's a
good master?

2632
02:48:15,885 --> 02:48:25,926
MATT: "Those who deserve punishment get it. But we
hunt with it. It brings us power. It promises

2633
02:48:25,926 --> 02:48:34,269
"expansion of the Ravenites, and we will no longer
live under the boot of those in this countryside

2634
02:48:34,269 --> 02:48:36,267
"and this continent."

2635
02:48:36,267 --> 02:48:38,097
LIAM: How's it going?

2636
02:48:38,097 --> 02:48:40,103
LAURA: Really bad.

2637
02:48:40,103 --> 02:48:46,658
MATT: "We have children to feed. We have families
of our own."

2638
02:48:46,658 --> 02:48:51,369
LAURA: How can we help?

2639
02:48:51,369 --> 02:48:53,702
MATT: "How can you help?"

2640
02:48:53,702 --> 02:48:56,206
LAURA: That's what we're here for.

2641
02:48:56,206 --> 02:49:03,214
MATT: "Bring us food, bring us warmth, chop some
firewood. Bring some trees. Work."

2642
02:49:03,214 --> 02:49:08,251
LAURA: Gladly. But not in chains. We do this
freely.

2643
02:49:08,251 --> 02:49:19,994
MATT: "Give us your weapons, and you can walk
freely."

2644
02:49:19,994 --> 02:49:22,842
SAM: Let's kill them all.

2645
02:49:22,842 --> 02:49:28,145
LAURA: I'm sorry, that's not happening.

2646
02:49:28,145 --> 02:49:30,985
MATT: "Then leave."

2647
02:49:30,985 --> 02:49:33,308
LAURA: That we will.

2648
02:49:33,308 --> 02:49:37,503
MATT: "What is your business here, she who wanders
in the faces of others?"

2649
02:49:37,503 --> 02:49:40,135
MARISHA: That's a cool title.

2650
02:49:40,135 --> 02:49:55,839
LAURA: Yeah, add that to the list. Our entire
landscape is under attack. Now, Vorugal has helped

2651
02:49:55,839 --> 02:50:06,180
you, but they've made many others suffer, not just
Draconians. Entire cities brought down, for

2652
02:50:06,180 --> 02:50:17,275
nothing. We're here to right the wrong and help in
any way we can.

2653
02:50:17,275 --> 02:50:24,361
MATT: "You should talk to Tooma."

2654
02:50:24,361 --> 02:50:26,426
LAURA: Tooma.

2655
02:50:26,426 --> 02:50:29,606
MARISHA: Tooma. It is not a tumor.

2656
02:50:29,606 --> 02:50:32,083
LAURA: We knew that was going to happen.

2657
02:50:32,083 --> 02:50:37,715
LIAM: Took about 1.5 seconds to fuck with Matt's
name.

2658
02:50:37,715 --> 02:50:40,860
TALIESIN: I think he <i>assumed</i>.

2659
02:50:40,860 --> 02:50:49,048
MATT: All you're doing is putting fuel on the
fire.

2660
02:50:49,048 --> 02:50:53,270
(groaning)

2661
02:50:53,270 --> 02:50:54,848
SAM: Is it Tooma?

2662
02:50:54,848 --> 02:50:56,191
MATT: Tooma. T-O-O-M-A.

2663
02:50:56,191 --> 02:50:58,610
LIAM: That's totally different.

2664
02:50:58,610 --> 02:51:03,571
LAURA: Who is Tooma?

2665
02:51:03,571 --> 02:51:19,681
MATT: "Tooma is our chieftain. I'm not to make
this decision. Come. No chains, for now." They all

2666
02:51:19,681 --> 02:51:23,478
stay with their spears still out in front, but
they nudge you forward.

2667
02:51:23,478 --> 02:51:27,373
LAURA: I explain everything that's happening in
Common as we walk. Is everyone still cool with

2668
02:51:27,373 --> 02:51:28,825
this? We're going to the chieftain.

2669
02:51:28,825 --> 02:51:30,899
SAM: Just tell us when it's time to kill
everybody.

2670
02:51:30,899 --> 02:51:32,505
LIAM: We improvise. It's what we do.

2671
02:51:32,505 --> 02:51:36,104
TALIESIN: I think this is actually going far
better than I had hoped.

2672
02:51:36,104 --> 02:51:41,823
SAM: Just remember Vex, ticking time bomb here.
We've got to get in, get out. We've got one day here.

2673
02:51:41,823 --> 02:51:44,531
TRAVIS: Are there any trees that we can see as
we're walking?

2674
02:51:44,531 --> 02:51:49,022
LAURA: They actually said they wanted us to chop
firewood, so if we can get sent on that mission,

2675
02:51:49,022 --> 02:51:50,716
we're set.

2676
02:51:50,716 --> 02:51:52,187
MATT: Make a perception check.

2677
02:51:52,187 --> 02:51:55,487
TRAVIS: Hey, 19!

2678
02:51:55,487 --> 02:52:00,960
LAURA: Are we in the mountains? No. Are we?

2679
02:52:00,960 --> 02:52:02,403
LIAM: 29.

2680
02:52:02,403 --> 02:52:04,634
MATT: You're in a ravine. Perception check was
just for Grog, as he's the only one that asked to

2681
02:52:04,634 --> 02:52:06,691
look for trees. But you rolled a 19?

2682
02:52:06,691 --> 02:52:07,689
TRAVIS: I did!

2683
02:52:07,689 --> 02:52:13,914
MATT: Looking around, occasionally poking out of
the rubble, you'll see a tree. Most of them seem

2684
02:52:13,914 --> 02:52:19,401
to have not fared so well with the cold weather
and have been snapped or broken in the process of

2685
02:52:19,401 --> 02:52:25,361
the falling rubble. You do make out, towards the
edge on the other side of the ravine, beyond this

2686
02:52:25,361 --> 02:52:31,142
giant one, you can see this one island, one larger
island of the cluster that made up Draconia, fell

2687
02:52:31,142 --> 02:52:35,202
in the center here and is broken apart. On the far
end, you can see there's a small cluster of trees,

2688
02:52:35,202 --> 02:52:39,015
the hint of green still to them, some of them
varying thickness.

2689
02:52:39,015 --> 02:52:41,903
MARISHA: I could work with that.

2690
02:52:41,903 --> 02:52:44,699
TRAVIS: Might be a long way, though.

2691
02:52:44,699 --> 02:52:51,951
LIAM: We've been here, what, ten minutes?

2692
02:52:51,951 --> 02:52:54,911
MATT: I'd say about 20.

2693
02:52:54,911 --> 02:53:00,684
SAM: So we're going to go see Tooma, or we're
going to chop down some fucking trees?

2694
02:53:00,684 --> 02:53:04,316
LAURA: We have to go. They're walking us to the
chieftain. Can't just walk away now.

2695
02:53:04,316 --> 02:53:09,205
MATT: You guys are prodded along, over the rubble,
and as you come around you can start to see, where

2696
02:53:09,205 --> 02:53:16,711
the outside of the island is broken rock, the
center of it is broken structures. Buildings,

2697
02:53:16,711 --> 02:53:24,911
homes, giant great marble halls, everything is
mostly fallen in. You still see some structures

2698
02:53:24,911 --> 02:53:31,143
standing, but at odd angles. There are sections of
buildings that still show the outer outline of

2699
02:53:31,143 --> 02:53:42,491
what once stood, but it is all a complete ruin.
You do see every now and then a few large spikes

2700
02:53:42,491 --> 02:53:48,853
of ice that are jutting out of portions, and you
see bodies that are jabbed onto the spikes and

2701
02:53:48,853 --> 02:53:50,661
left to freeze.

2702
02:53:50,661 --> 02:53:52,193
LAURA: Do they have tails?

2703
02:53:52,193 --> 02:54:07,504
MATT: They do. You move over the bulk of this
giant pile of rubble and begin to descend the

2704
02:54:07,504 --> 02:54:18,452
other side, and you can see now there is an active
village here that is half-frozen entirely. Half of

2705
02:54:18,452 --> 02:54:27,047
it seems to be abandoned; the other half of it is
completely coated in solid ice. The crowd leads

2706
02:54:27,047 --> 02:54:33,772
you past that abandoned village to a series of
tunnels against the wall, maybe 300 or 400 feet

2707
02:54:33,772 --> 02:54:43,576
past that cluster of trees that you saw. Leads you
into this tunnel, and on the inside, there are small

2708
02:54:43,576 --> 02:54:50,658
glow stones set in portions of the stone. Not
naturally forming, but essentially small natural

2709
02:54:50,658 --> 02:54:54,907
bits of torchlight just pressed into the stonework
to give some sort of a light source.

2710
02:54:54,907 --> 02:55:05,696
You're led in for about five or so minutes. and
you see other offshoot tunnels. It's like a giant

2711
02:55:05,696 --> 02:55:14,490
anthill weaved throughout this, and you can see
rudimentary furniture made of wood and stone, with

2712
02:55:14,490 --> 02:55:19,505
limestone rock, whatever's available within the
actual ravine here.

2713
02:55:19,505 --> 02:55:24,701
MARISHA: Can I get a sense on when this was
carved? If this was carved recently or if this has

2714
02:55:24,701 --> 02:55:26,397
been here a while?

2715
02:55:26,397 --> 02:55:28,514
MATT: Make a nature check.

2716
02:55:28,514 --> 02:55:32,980
MARISHA: Ooh, 27.

2717
02:55:32,980 --> 02:55:38,181
MATT: Best you can tell from looking at the rock
and knowing the amount of erosion versus the

2718
02:55:38,181 --> 02:55:51,408
curvature of it, these tunnels have been here for
a very long time. This portion opens up and you

2719
02:55:51,408 --> 02:56:03,080
can see now there is a much more refined,
village-type structure inside, maybe 30-plus small

2720
02:56:03,080 --> 02:56:08,488
homes carved from rock and stone. Built much
better than the makeshift huts that you saw

2721
02:56:08,488 --> 02:56:19,510
outside. You also see a giant pile of broken
chains to the left side of the entryway. Many of

2722
02:56:19,510 --> 02:56:26,456
them are manacles and neck vices that are just
thrown and discarded in this large pile.

2723
02:56:26,456 --> 02:56:30,983
MARISHA: Tiberius never mentioned this side of
Draconia.

2724
02:56:30,983 --> 02:56:40,543
MATT: As you are brought into the center of this
larger chamber you see two dozen Draconians that

2725
02:56:40,543 --> 02:56:44,838
are out and about just currently gathering
materials, talking and walking, and stop and see as you

2726
02:56:44,838 --> 02:56:54,076
enter and just watch as you pass by. Colors range
from metallic to chromatic, all spectrum; it's a

2727
02:56:54,076 --> 02:56:56,905
mish-mash of all walks and sizes.

2728
02:56:56,905 --> 02:57:01,936
LIAM: And the chromatic-- the red, the blue, the
green-- are we seeing tails on them?

2729
02:57:01,936 --> 02:57:03,099
MATT: Nope.

2730
02:57:03,099 --> 02:57:04,568
MARISHA: No tails.

2731
02:57:04,568 --> 02:57:06,857
LAURA: Nobody has tails down here.

2732
02:57:06,857 --> 02:57:12,164
SAM: I could make us all Draconian again without
tails.

2733
02:57:12,164 --> 02:57:14,559
LAURA: That would probably work at this point,
right?

2734
02:57:14,559 --> 02:57:20,658
MATT: You're led past a couple of these stone
structures and there is a central, open circular

2735
02:57:20,658 --> 02:57:30,487
plot between a lot of these. There's a fountain
that seems to spring a very clean source of water

2736
02:57:30,487 --> 02:57:37,223
within the center of this chamber. Beyond that,
there is a larger temple-like square structure

2737
02:57:37,223 --> 02:57:43,916
that has a slight trapezoidal appearance to it.
The entranceway is an open arch, and you can see a

2738
02:57:43,916 --> 02:57:47,047
large fire burning on the inside of it.

2739
02:57:47,047 --> 02:57:55,791
You are led around the fountain and led to the
inside. There, sitting on a large stone seat made

2740
02:57:55,791 --> 02:58:02,980
of haphazard bits of rock and stone, it looks
relatively uncomfortable, a large stone throne,

2741
02:58:02,980 --> 02:58:15,365
there is a female dragonborn. She wears long,
drab, gray robes, tattered at the edges, a hood

2742
02:58:15,365 --> 02:58:22,069
loosely pulled back and a large scarf or wrap
around her neck and shoulders. She just sits there

2743
02:58:22,069 --> 02:58:26,472
with her hands over the side, draped, and as you
walk in and your eyes adjust you can see that she

2744
02:58:26,472 --> 02:58:36,488
looks very old. As you're brought in, the rest of
your crew still pushes you in with the spears. She

2745
02:58:36,488 --> 02:58:43,810
leans forward. "Are these prisoners of ours?"

2746
02:58:43,810 --> 02:58:55,249
The dragonborn who brought you in goes, "They are,
for the time being. They say they come here

2747
02:58:55,249 --> 02:59:11,352
"because the Frigid Doom and other dragons who came
are killing their people, as well. They have come

2748
02:59:11,352 --> 02:59:24,813
"to fight the dragon, or so they claim. They walked
in under guise of our enemy. It is your wisdom to

2749
02:59:24,813 --> 02:59:30,479
"make these choices." And the larger dragonborn
bows his head and steps away, the spears pull back

2750
02:59:30,479 --> 02:59:35,287
and they step, blocking the exits that you walked
through; the entire archway now is shoulder to

2751
02:59:35,287 --> 02:59:37,755
shoulder dragonborn with spears at the ready.

2752
02:59:37,755 --> 02:59:48,637
LAURA: Tooma. We apologize for coming in the guise
of your enemies. Unfortunately, we don't know much

2753
02:59:48,637 --> 02:59:57,511
about your culture, and no one ever informed us of
what you have suffered, and we apologize.

2754
02:59:57,511 --> 03:00:03,407
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2755
03:00:03,407 --> 03:00:09,600
LAURA: 23?

2756
03:00:09,600 --> 03:00:18,283
MATT: You're saying this in Draconic, I assume?
She leans in a bit, and the firelight crackles

2757
03:00:18,283 --> 03:00:26,108
under her chin, and you can see the teeth on one
side pull out beyond the lip, and it gives her

2758
03:00:26,108 --> 03:00:40,772
this lopsided look. The tongue wipes across the
front, and she leans in toward you. "You come here

2759
03:00:40,772 --> 03:00:44,025
"to fight the Frigid Doom, you say?"

2760
03:00:44,025 --> 03:00:47,365
LAURA: Yes.

2761
03:00:47,365 --> 03:00:58,524
MATT: "I would be lying if I said it did not bring
a chance for freedom to all of us Ravenites."

2762
03:00:58,524 --> 03:01:00,922
LAURA: Much deserved.

2763
03:01:00,922 --> 03:01:17,159
MATT: "But as time progresses, I fear we shake one
bond to step into another. The dragon presented

2764
03:01:17,159 --> 03:01:27,515
"itself as our savior, but has since required an
ever-growing fealty."

2765
03:01:27,515 --> 03:01:30,078
LAURA: They do that.

2766
03:01:30,078 --> 03:01:41,671
MATT: "Without the Draconians, without the
Sky-walkers, and without the Doom, we would be

2767
03:01:41,671 --> 03:01:49,816
"free. Rebuild our culture."

2768
03:01:49,816 --> 03:01:56,074
LAURA: I want nothing more for you than that. Let
us help you.

2769
03:01:56,074 --> 03:02:05,318
MATT: Now, the rest of you hear this: "Do your
friends speak Common?"

2770
03:02:05,318 --> 03:02:07,771
TALIESIN: Oh, that's lovely.

2771
03:02:07,771 --> 03:02:08,817
MARISHA: Hi!

2772
03:02:08,817 --> 03:02:10,023
SAM: Hi, yes.

2773
03:02:10,023 --> 03:02:11,611
LAURA: Much relieved. Yes, they do.

2774
03:02:11,611 --> 03:02:12,951
SAM: Grog doesn't, but we do.

2775
03:02:12,951 --> 03:02:15,680
TRAVIS: (moans)

2776
03:02:15,680 --> 03:02:22,458
(laughter)

2777
03:02:22,458 --> 03:02:39,797
MATT: "If we are to let you go, do you promise to
slay this creature?"

2778
03:02:39,797 --> 03:02:45,006
LAURA: We will do everything in our power to watch
it die.

2779
03:02:45,006 --> 03:02:47,691
LIAM: It is our only purpose.

2780
03:02:47,691 --> 03:02:50,721
MATT: "It has been gone for days."

2781
03:02:50,721 --> 03:02:52,861
LAURA: It should be back very soon.

2782
03:02:52,861 --> 03:02:55,508
MATT: "Took most of its army with it."

2783
03:02:55,508 --> 03:02:58,295
SAM: Grog was right! He's always right!

2784
03:02:58,295 --> 03:03:06,371
TALIESIN: That was our hope, that we would be able
to come here when it was at its weakest and get a

2785
03:03:06,371 --> 03:03:07,404
sense of it.

2786
03:03:07,404 --> 03:03:10,103
SAM: Do you know where its lair is?

2787
03:03:10,103 --> 03:03:11,384
MATT: "I do."

2788
03:03:11,384 --> 03:03:14,019
SAM: Is it far?

2789
03:03:14,019 --> 03:03:18,016
MATT: "It is not far, but one hour walk."

2790
03:03:18,016 --> 03:03:19,841
LAURA: Can I roll an insight check on her?

2791
03:03:19,841 --> 03:03:21,625
MATT: You may.

2792
03:03:21,625 --> 03:03:26,199
LAURA: 19.

2793
03:03:26,199 --> 03:03:27,684
MATT: 19?

2794
03:03:27,684 --> 03:03:30,024
SAM: (gasps) Oh boy.

2795
03:03:30,024 --> 03:03:36,020
TALIESIN: Do you know what I like as much as
whispers? Loot Crate.

2796
03:03:36,020 --> 03:03:42,526
SAM: What? Taliesin. You've got to do better than
that. Try something like this: You know, Matt's an

2797
03:03:42,526 --> 03:03:47,373
asshole, but you know who's not? The good people
at Loot Crate.

2798
03:03:47,373 --> 03:03:53,286
TALIESIN: Loot Crate doesn't decide to just tell one
person about what's going on. They let everyone

2799
03:03:53,286 --> 03:03:56,846
know, not just Vex.

2800
03:03:56,846 --> 03:04:01,261
SAM: Hey, you never told us what he whispered to
you before.

2801
03:04:01,261 --> 03:04:02,903
MATT: No, he didn't.

2802
03:04:02,903 --> 03:04:04,966
LIAM: We're good.

2803
03:04:04,966 --> 03:04:06,569
SAM: Oh boy.

2804
03:04:06,569 --> 03:04:09,677
LIAM: I'm a vampire. Just deal with it.

2805
03:04:09,677 --> 03:04:17,133
MATT: "If you come here to kill this dragon, I
assume you have the means and a plan."

2806
03:04:17,133 --> 03:04:19,308
SAM: We definitely have plans.

2807
03:04:19,308 --> 03:04:21,066
MARISHA: Totally have a plan.

2808
03:04:21,066 --> 03:04:22,835
MATT: "Then let us set an ambush."

2809
03:04:22,835 --> 03:04:25,289
SAM: Ambush? Sorry?

2810
03:04:25,289 --> 03:04:26,975
MARISHA: Come again?

2811
03:04:26,975 --> 03:04:39,793
LAURA: Well, we tried to do that one other time.
While it did pay off, and its brother is dead, a

2812
03:04:39,793 --> 03:04:45,340
lot of people died in the process. A lot. Very
large, strong people.

2813
03:04:45,340 --> 03:04:52,574
MATT: "So what do you insist? We not have an
ambush, we just wait for it to land and attack head-on?"

2814
03:04:52,574 --> 03:05:04,066
SAM: We were going to use this opportunity to find
our way into its lair and find its weaknesses, and plan.

2815
03:05:04,066 --> 03:05:06,798
MARISHA: Sabotage, from the inside.

2816
03:05:06,798 --> 03:05:10,138
TALIESIN: There's more than one dragon, and they
are supporting each other.

2817
03:05:10,138 --> 03:05:15,523
MARISHA: We kill this one, it'll set off a chain
reaction that we might not be able to recover from

2818
03:05:15,523 --> 03:05:17,493
if we're not fully prepared.

2819
03:05:17,493 --> 03:05:25,455
TALIESIN: We want to make the means to make sure
that when the time comes, we can destroy them all

2820
03:05:25,455 --> 03:05:27,343
in one fell swoop.

2821
03:05:27,343 --> 03:05:32,241
LAURA: The risk here is that by destroying
Vorugal--

2822
03:05:32,241 --> 03:05:37,103
SAM: The Frigid Doom.

2823
03:05:37,103 --> 03:05:41,086
LAURA: We'll bring the wrath of the others upon
you.

2824
03:05:41,086 --> 03:05:42,745
TALIESIN: He is not the strongest.

2825
03:05:42,745 --> 03:05:47,842
LAURA: Thordak is much larger, and I don't think
he's been here.

2826
03:05:47,842 --> 03:05:55,281
MATT: "You speak with accents I do not understand.
Where do you come from?"

2827
03:05:55,281 --> 03:05:56,974
TALIESIN: Everywhere.

2828
03:05:56,974 --> 03:05:58,393
MARISHA: We're a motley crew.

2829
03:05:58,393 --> 03:06:01,483
LAURA: Lots of different places.

2830
03:06:01,483 --> 03:06:03,435
TRAVIS: Do not answer that question.

2831
03:06:03,435 --> 03:06:05,821
TALIESIN: We can answer the continent.

2832
03:06:05,821 --> 03:06:09,322
LAURA: As you can see, we're half-elves.

2833
03:06:09,322 --> 03:06:22,847
MATT: "We are to walk to the den. We are to learn
your information. Then what?"

2834
03:06:22,847 --> 03:06:29,574
TALIESIN: Set up a situation where we can monitor
you and possibly contact you when it's time, and

2835
03:06:29,574 --> 03:06:33,506
even let you know if we think the dragon's about
to leave, so that you can prepare.

2836
03:06:33,506 --> 03:06:45,846
MATT: "I have lived to see this day by not being
deceived or tricked. You speak words that are not

2837
03:06:45,846 --> 03:06:56,360
"direct. They wind. They spin. They circle. What
guarantee do I have that you will not just flee?"

2838
03:06:56,360 --> 03:07:02,845
MARISHA: To be fair, what guarantee do we have
that you won't kill us, and the ambush was meant

2839
03:07:02,845 --> 03:07:07,703
for us? I believe there is untrust on both sides.

2840
03:07:07,703 --> 03:07:15,572
MATT: At which point, she steps off of the throne,
steps on both of her feet, and when she's off the

2841
03:07:15,572 --> 03:07:22,832
throne, her imposing form becomes far less
imposing. You can see now there's a very heavy

2842
03:07:22,832 --> 03:07:31,390
hunch to her back, and as she scuffles forward,
she's an almost pitiful-looking sight, physically.

2843
03:07:31,390 --> 03:07:39,334
As she pulls forward to walk straight to you,
Keyleth, you see the somewhat clouded,

2844
03:07:39,334 --> 03:07:50,823
cataract-ridden eyes of the dragonborn female
Tooma. She comes up to you and goes, "We are a

2845
03:07:50,823 --> 03:07:59,186
"proud people, even when pressed into the dirt for
as many years as we have been. We reclaim our

2846
03:07:59,186 --> 03:08:09,252
"honor. We reclaim our place in this world. We wish
to do this as peacefully as possible, but we have

2847
03:08:09,252 --> 03:08:15,787
"been forced to scrounge and survive through this
freedom. We wish you no folly. We wish you no ill

2848
03:08:15,787 --> 03:08:21,830
"will. But we also have learned that trust needs to
be earned; it cannot be spoken and given so

2849
03:08:21,830 --> 03:08:33,944
"freely. Both ways. You are right to mistrust, as
are we of you. But that is the impasse. One must

2850
03:08:33,944 --> 03:08:37,855
"have faith, in one way or another, if there is to
be a compromise."

2851
03:08:37,855 --> 03:08:45,442
MARISHA: I think faith and trust are not mutually
exclusive. I can not trust you and still have

2852
03:08:45,442 --> 03:08:52,682
faith, and you should not feel lack of pride for
living in the dirt, or surviving. There's nothing

2853
03:08:52,682 --> 03:09:00,382
wrong with that. But I understand your urge to
want to rebuild, become the great culture that I

2854
03:09:00,382 --> 03:09:10,400
know you all are. So you should at least trust
that we have similar interests in the end.

2855
03:09:10,400 --> 03:09:15,096
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2856
03:09:15,096 --> 03:09:20,585
MARISHA: Ooh! 19!

2857
03:09:20,585 --> 03:09:22,199
SAM: Was that opal?

2858
03:09:22,199 --> 03:09:23,863
TALIESIN: Yes, it was.

2859
03:09:23,863 --> 03:09:27,126
MARISHA: Opal's back! 25.

2860
03:09:27,126 --> 03:09:35,086
MATT: 25. She reaches forward and extends a finger
that gently scrapes the bottom of the chin, not

2861
03:09:35,086 --> 03:09:40,283
too much to hurt, but to go across the skin and
pull your chin upward into the light of the fire a

2862
03:09:40,283 --> 03:09:54,368
little bit. "There is much wisdom in there for so
young a face. All right. There are not many

2863
03:09:54,368 --> 03:10:08,140
"options we have, either. Come. We will walk. And
at the very least, if you decide to flee, never return."

2864
03:10:08,140 --> 03:10:12,805
MARISHA: We can give you that word.

2865
03:10:12,805 --> 03:10:19,934
LAURA: Tooma. Are the Frigid Doom's armies around?
Will they see us?

2866
03:10:19,934 --> 03:10:29,919
MATT: "There are a handful of dregs that stayed
behind, but you tell me you wear many faces."

2867
03:10:29,919 --> 03:10:32,985
LAURA: We certainly don't want them to see ours.

2868
03:10:32,985 --> 03:10:35,583
SAM: What should we disguise ourselves as?

2869
03:10:35,583 --> 03:10:42,764
MATT: She points past, over your head, and goes,
"Tiny gnome, the faces of those that lead you here."

2870
03:10:42,764 --> 03:10:54,628
SAM: Okay, tiny is uncalled for, but I understand.
The faces of your tribe, of your clan. All right.

2871
03:10:54,628 --> 03:10:57,884
MATT: "Be glad you walk with one as wise."

2872
03:10:57,884 --> 03:11:03,226
MARISHA: Is she talking about me? That's awesome!

2873
03:11:03,226 --> 03:11:08,171
MATT: She begins to shuffle over, and you watch as
two of the dragonborn walk over and scoop her up

2874
03:11:08,171 --> 03:11:15,451
shoulder to shoulder, and she shrugs them off and
pushes them away. "I can walk myself." She begins

2875
03:11:15,451 --> 03:11:19,995
shuffling, and they separate and open. She walks
partway out as you guys stand there, and turns

2876
03:11:19,995 --> 03:11:22,526
around and beckons. "Well, come."

2877
03:11:22,526 --> 03:11:24,093
TRAVIS: We follow.

2878
03:11:24,093 --> 03:11:25,709
LAURA: Can you cast Seeming again?

2879
03:11:25,709 --> 03:11:30,089
SAM: I can do Seeming one more time. All right.

2880
03:11:30,089 --> 03:11:32,348
LAURA: Wait, if you cast Seeming, will we still be
able to get into the--

2881
03:11:32,348 --> 03:11:40,324
SAM: We've still got the mansion. Handicaps me a
bit, but I will cast Seeming again on the party

2882
03:11:40,324 --> 03:11:45,441
and do the same thing, except slightly different
colors and slightly less tail.

2883
03:11:45,441 --> 03:11:50,307
(laughter)

2884
03:11:50,307 --> 03:11:54,161
MATT: The larger dragonborn that let you in--

2885
03:11:54,161 --> 03:12:10,346
SAM: My tail nub is slightly larger than the rest.
It's a cube. It's a tail cube.

2886
03:12:10,346 --> 03:12:15,845
MATT: As the rest of the guards circle around and
begin to walk, a little bit of trepidation, but

2887
03:12:15,845 --> 03:12:23,452
going along with Tooma, the large one who let you
in goes, "Tooma. Are you certain?"

2888
03:12:23,452 --> 03:12:32,145
She turns around and goes, "Skork, there are few
things that are certain in this world. I am not

2889
03:12:32,145 --> 03:12:39,053
"long for it, but if we are not to seize the
opportunity of kinship, we miss the opportunity

2890
03:12:39,053 --> 03:12:48,618
"for survival. Is it a risk? Yes. Sometimes it's a
risk worth taking." And she keeps walking. The

2891
03:12:48,618 --> 03:12:56,352
rest of them gather behind, and the now-named
Skork gives a nod and continues walking along.

2892
03:12:56,352 --> 03:12:57,864
SAM: Have we heard of Skork?

2893
03:12:57,864 --> 03:12:59,191
MARISHA: Is that his name?

2894
03:12:59,191 --> 03:13:01,746
LAURA: He was the guy that we talked to right when
we got here.

2895
03:13:01,746 --> 03:13:09,082
MATT: Yeah. You guys are led out of the tunnel,
back into the freezing air. The wind has picked up

2896
03:13:09,082 --> 03:13:16,751
a bit, and you can now hear this low hum as it
hits certain portions of the cavern and causes low

2897
03:13:16,751 --> 03:13:23,754
vibrational whistles in the distance. The snow has
begun to fall a little heavier now, and as you

2898
03:13:23,754 --> 03:13:26,841
walk out, you can hear the crunch of your
footsteps as you're stepping through heavier and

2899
03:13:26,841 --> 03:13:28,630
heavier blankets of snow.

2900
03:13:28,630 --> 03:13:38,938
LAURA: Can I tell Tooma, as we walk out: P.S., if
that dragon comes back, we need to bolt.

2901
03:13:38,938 --> 03:13:47,980
MATT: She nods. "If that dragon comes back, we
never saw you, you never saw us."

2902
03:13:47,980 --> 03:13:49,983
LAURA: Thank you.

2903
03:13:49,983 --> 03:13:55,170
MATT: She's very slow, by the way. Your passage of
travel is about half speed as she leads the

2904
03:13:55,170 --> 03:13:57,930
charge, but everyone respectfully keeps in pace
with her.

2905
03:13:57,930 --> 03:14:03,396
SAM: Tooma, have you ever heard of a dragonborn
named Gern Blanston?

2906
03:14:03,396 --> 03:14:10,787
MATT: She thinks for a second. "That name has not
come to my mind, no."

2907
03:14:10,787 --> 03:14:14,331
SAM: Us neither.

2908
03:14:14,331 --> 03:14:28,571
MATT: Pushing on, it's gotten a little lighter in
the sky. You figure, based on your arrival, you

2909
03:14:28,571 --> 03:14:33,984
may have just come in at the cusp of dawn, and the
sun has now gotten higher in the sky. You're on

2910
03:14:33,984 --> 03:14:39,611
the entire opposite side of the planet now, so the
cycle has changed based on the location you're

2911
03:14:39,611 --> 03:14:48,791
currently in. Well, you had rested, actually. You
left in the morning. You would've gotten here--

2912
03:14:48,791 --> 03:14:53,690
actually, opposite of that. It's actually now
getting to dusk. Even though it's only been a

2913
03:14:53,690 --> 03:14:58,933
couple of hours of daylight that you've seen since
you woke up this morning, it's already beginning

2914
03:14:58,933 --> 03:15:01,368
to set, and the sky is getting darker.

2915
03:15:01,368 --> 03:15:05,039
LAURA: We lost a day, but the dragon will still
take the same amount of time.

2916
03:15:05,039 --> 03:15:06,976
LIAM: Ugh. I'm so tree-lagged, though.

2917
03:15:06,976 --> 03:15:10,617
MARISHA: I know. Always sucks going west to east.

2918
03:15:10,617 --> 03:15:20,955
MATT: You're led over a portion of the ravine,
ever so slowly, that lifts up, and then as you get

2919
03:15:20,955 --> 03:15:24,906
to the crest, it bends down into a far deeper and
wider portion of the ravine. This is now the

2920
03:15:24,906 --> 03:15:36,808
center part of this entire giant physical anomaly
that is this giant crack in the ground, and you

2921
03:15:36,808 --> 03:15:40,779
can see the bulk of the fallen city is in the
center of this area.

2922
03:15:40,779 --> 03:15:42,736
LAURA: Do we see any big trees around here?

2923
03:15:42,736 --> 03:15:50,945
MATT: You see a couple of larger trees that sprout
out from the rubble. There's ones that managed to

2924
03:15:50,945 --> 03:15:55,327
survive the impact of certain areas of stone,
though it looks like a lot of the bark has been

2925
03:15:55,327 --> 03:16:00,985
stripped, and they might not be alive that you can
see from this distance. There are smaller trees

2926
03:16:00,985 --> 03:16:05,128
towards the edge, and a few still protruding from
portions of the walls.

2927
03:16:05,128 --> 03:16:07,383
SAM: Note every tree as we walk by.

2928
03:16:07,383 --> 03:16:13,587
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm paying attention to the trees.
That's the biggest tree that's now closest to us.

2929
03:16:13,587 --> 03:16:17,709
Now <i>that's</i> the biggest tree that's now closest
to us. Now that one.

2930
03:16:17,709 --> 03:16:23,957
MATT: As you're led down into the ravine, you
reach this central structure, and you can already

2931
03:16:23,957 --> 03:16:31,130
see from this distance, as the snow falls, hitting
and covering the rocks, there are dozens and

2932
03:16:31,130 --> 03:16:39,150
dozens of those spikes of ice jutting out of the
rock, each with one or two various frozen corpses

2933
03:16:39,150 --> 03:16:47,741
impaled on them and left. At the top of this, you
can see a large cluster of ice that is in a

2934
03:16:47,741 --> 03:17:00,006
somewhat round gathering, and you can see--
actually, no, you don't see that. Sorry. A note

2935
03:17:00,006 --> 03:17:01,885
that will come into play in the future.

2936
03:17:01,885 --> 03:17:06,870
TRAVIS: Can I ask a question? The bodies on the
spikes. None of them look familiar, right?

2937
03:17:06,870 --> 03:17:14,987
MATT: You can keep watch as you go. You push
towards the center of the ravine, and upon the

2938
03:17:14,987 --> 03:17:24,282
large island of rubble, you begin to move, and it
takes a good 40, 50 minutes, an hour, to traverse,

2939
03:17:24,282 --> 03:17:29,280
a lot further than you would've expected in that
time period. Sorry, a lot less than you figured

2940
03:17:29,280 --> 03:17:36,810
you would traverse in that time, being weighed
down by Tooma's gait. However, the rubble begins

2941
03:17:36,810 --> 03:17:45,597
to subside, and you begin to see steps of ice. Not
perfect, carved steps, but elements of

2942
03:17:45,597 --> 03:17:58,435
encapsulated broken platforms of ice that act as
stairs. Vax, Vex, and Keyleth, as you guys begin

2943
03:17:58,435 --> 03:18:03,404
to move up the steps, and you especially, Vex, you
can see, with what little bit of light is

2944
03:18:03,404 --> 03:18:15,763
beginning to shine down through the ice, you can
see mounds and mounds of coins and jewel boxes and

2945
03:18:15,763 --> 03:18:30,339
many expensive knick-knacks and collections, all
below feet of solid ice, all clustered towards the

2946
03:18:30,339 --> 03:18:35,706
apex of this collapsed, ruined island.

2947
03:18:35,706 --> 03:18:45,593
LAURA: Tooma, is Vorugal having you collect all of
this?

2948
03:18:45,593 --> 03:18:58,670
MATT: "Vorugal sends us to pay the debt we owe for
being freed, yes. We scavenge. We spend our days

2949
03:18:58,670 --> 03:19:07,970
"searching for food, for the means to survive, and
finding what we can from the ruins of the broken

2950
03:19:07,970 --> 03:19:09,297
"Draconia."

2951
03:19:09,297 --> 03:19:13,213
LAURA: And when you can't find anything? What
then?

2952
03:19:13,213 --> 03:19:25,597
MATT: "These are the thoughts that consume me. It
is the reason you are still alive." Everyone make

2953
03:19:25,597 --> 03:19:27,580
a perception check.

2954
03:19:27,580 --> 03:19:38,309
SAM: Yeah, dog! 14!

2955
03:19:38,309 --> 03:19:40,190
MARISHA: 28.

2956
03:19:40,190 --> 03:19:41,595
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

2957
03:19:41,595 --> 03:19:43,989
SAM: That wasn't the golden snitch?

2958
03:19:43,989 --> 03:19:47,616
TALIESIN: No, I put the golden snitch away for the
evening.

2959
03:19:47,616 --> 03:19:50,704
LAURA: I got a natural 20 when I dropped it.
Giving up on it.

2960
03:19:50,704 --> 03:19:57,287
MATT: As you guys begin to approach, you can see
now the ice that encases the golden coins begins

2961
03:19:57,287 --> 03:20:01,757
to ripple upward, and it's getting harder and
harder to climb. You can see now, it comes to an

2962
03:20:01,757 --> 03:20:07,181
apex in this bowl-like formation, and as you get
to a point where it's harder to ascend, you can

2963
03:20:07,181 --> 03:20:12,948
see Tooma stops and sees that she can't go much
further, and she points up and goes, "That is

2964
03:20:12,948 --> 03:20:21,839
"where it sleeps. That is where we come to give
what we find. And that is where it should fall."

2965
03:20:21,839 --> 03:20:34,226
LAURA: What is its nature? Is it vain? Does it
want you to bow before it?

2966
03:20:34,226 --> 03:20:51,181
MATT: "It does not ask for kneeling. It asks for
fear and respect. It asks us to bring the most

2967
03:20:51,181 --> 03:20:54,849
"powerful creatures in the land for it to chase."

2968
03:20:54,849 --> 03:21:08,231
LAURA: Can I roll an insight check on her again?
Jesus. This is creepy. 27.

2969
03:21:08,231 --> 03:21:14,917
MATT: 27.

2970
03:21:14,917 --> 03:21:16,743
LIAM: So the box is full of loot?

2971
03:21:16,743 --> 03:21:18,690
SAM: No, it's a crate, Liam.

2972
03:21:18,690 --> 03:21:21,140
LIAM: The crate is full of boxes?

2973
03:21:21,140 --> 03:21:28,683
SAM: Yes. A crate full of boxes. Box Crate, our
best sponsor. Inside the boxes are tinier boxes.

2974
03:21:28,683 --> 03:21:31,318
LIAM: When do you get to the loot, though?

2975
03:21:31,318 --> 03:21:34,882
SAM: No, it's a Russian nesting doll of boxes and
crates.

2976
03:21:34,882 --> 03:21:36,199
LIAM: Box-box.

2977
03:21:36,199 --> 03:21:40,794
SAM: Box-box, and then inside is a box-crate, and
inside that is tiny-bag-crate.

2978
03:21:40,794 --> 03:21:44,141
LAURA: What are you guys talking about?

2979
03:21:44,141 --> 03:21:47,256
SAM: Liam! Do you want all those boxes?

2980
03:21:47,256 --> 03:21:48,971
LIAM: I need boxes.

2981
03:21:48,971 --> 03:21:57,965
SAM: You get $3 off the first box of boxes.
Crate-crate.

2982
03:21:57,965 --> 03:22:09,804
MATT: All right. So. "This is its home. This is
its shrine."

2983
03:22:09,804 --> 03:22:15,085
LAURA: Check for fucking traps before we go in
there.

2984
03:22:15,085 --> 03:22:17,450
SAM: Is it up? Is it down? Is it through?

2985
03:22:17,450 --> 03:22:23,229
MATT: The top comes into this giant bowl, this
platform of ice, and it's almost like a nest where

2986
03:22:23,229 --> 03:22:24,453
it sits.

2987
03:22:24,453 --> 03:22:25,745
TRAVIS: A big icy dog bed.

2988
03:22:25,745 --> 03:22:31,112
SAM: By the way, we've been in dragons' lairs
before, and the lairs themselves do things, right?

2989
03:22:31,112 --> 03:22:33,634
LIAM: Yes, with the dragon in them.

2990
03:22:33,634 --> 03:22:37,417
SAM: But when the dragon's not in them they don't
do anything?

2991
03:22:37,417 --> 03:22:42,126
LIAM: My sister and I are going to have a look
around. I have a question for you, though. If we

2992
03:22:42,126 --> 03:22:51,665
make a stand here today, in theory, is it worth it
to you to stand with us?

2993
03:22:51,665 --> 03:22:55,952
MATT: "If you feel confident. Otherwise, we walk
to our death prematurely."

2994
03:22:55,952 --> 03:23:01,533
LAURA: Yeah, let's not do that today. This is
reconnaissance.

2995
03:23:01,533 --> 03:23:05,320
TALIESIN: If all goes well, we will have one more
conversation.

2996
03:23:05,320 --> 03:23:10,143
LIAM: All right. I'm going to start searching the
ground for traps.

2997
03:23:10,143 --> 03:23:16,359
TALIESIN: I do have one other question: The bodies
on the spikes. How did that happen? What was that?

2998
03:23:16,359 --> 03:23:27,237
MATT: "When the islands fell, there was a great
fight of those that survived against the dragon.

2999
03:23:27,237 --> 03:23:43,923
"We did not join in, out of fear, and out of not
knowing which side would come out. Vorugal stayed

3000
03:23:43,923 --> 03:23:55,400
"behind as the other two flew. The dragon asked us
why we do not fight. We said, 'Because it is not

3001
03:23:55,400 --> 03:24:07,289
"'our place.' The dragon said, 'Well, your place is
now that of free kin.' The dragon summoned forth

3002
03:24:07,289 --> 03:24:20,803
"these spikes, and drove it through the hearts of
many of the Sky-walkers. Many of us cheered, for

3003
03:24:20,803 --> 03:24:30,884
"it was a symbol that many had wished to see for a
long time, but at the same time, the older ones of

3004
03:24:30,884 --> 03:24:45,432
"us... It was not what we wanted. It was not how we
wished to be freed. But we had no way of stopping

3005
03:24:45,432 --> 03:24:56,909
"him. As time went on, and with each surviving
Sky-walker that was found, there were no more

3006
03:24:56,909 --> 03:25:10,482
"cheers. Just the dread of knowing that maybe in
time, when all the spikes are filled, it may be us

3007
03:25:10,482 --> 03:25:12,551
"on them next."

3008
03:25:12,551 --> 03:25:15,464
TALIESIN: Thank you.

3009
03:25:15,464 --> 03:25:20,324
LIAM: 29. Looking for any traps.

3010
03:25:20,324 --> 03:25:25,593
MATT: Okay. You spend the next 15 minutes or so,
20 minutes, skirting around the outside of this

3011
03:25:25,593 --> 03:25:38,001
large frozen bowl, looking for some semblance of a
set trap. You don't recognize anything as any sort

3012
03:25:38,001 --> 03:25:43,138
of mechanism placed that would set off your
warning defense systems as a rogue.

3013
03:25:43,138 --> 03:25:53,991
LAURA: Can I stand on the top and look out from
the platform and see what is visible from the

3014
03:25:53,991 --> 03:25:57,441
platform and what areas seem hidden in the
landscape?

3015
03:25:57,441 --> 03:25:59,735
TALIESIN: I'm going to join you on that.

3016
03:25:59,735 --> 03:26:01,613
MATT: Both of you guys roll perception checks.

3017
03:26:01,613 --> 03:26:03,244
SAM: I have an idea.

3018
03:26:03,244 --> 03:26:04,664
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

3019
03:26:04,664 --> 03:26:06,343
MARISHA: Natural fucking 20.

3020
03:26:06,343 --> 03:26:09,165
LAURA: I don't even need to look. Good.

3021
03:26:09,165 --> 03:26:13,638
TALIESIN: You both saw that, right? That just
fucking happened. This is not my normal die. This

3022
03:26:13,638 --> 03:26:14,948
is something I bought at Comic Con.

3023
03:26:14,948 --> 03:26:19,742
MATT: Oh, it's not the dice anymore. We know that
you've somehow gained the favor of some Aztec

3024
03:26:19,742 --> 03:26:23,679
deity that's trying to reclaim its foothold in the
current-day pantheon through you.

3025
03:26:23,679 --> 03:26:26,169
TALIESIN: Sumerian, you asshole.

3026
03:26:26,169 --> 03:26:28,309
MATT: It would be Sumerian.

3027
03:26:28,309 --> 03:26:31,822
TALIESIN: I'm bringing a shrine to Burning Man, by
the way.

3028
03:26:31,822 --> 03:26:34,249
LAURA: Oh, this is pertaining to dragons!

3029
03:26:34,249 --> 03:26:43,764
MATT: No, this is more of an icy terrain.
Nevertheless, between the two of you keeping an

3030
03:26:43,764 --> 03:26:46,618
eye out, through this Marduk Enki-loving fool over
here--

3031
03:26:46,618 --> 03:26:50,783
TALIESIN: Bless you for knowing a Sumerian deity.

3032
03:26:50,783 --> 03:26:59,286
MATT: You look off and see that most of it, and
its design here is to be a sentry point. The

3033
03:26:59,286 --> 03:27:05,171
reason it's built over the structure is it has a
view of the entirety of this central open valley

3034
03:27:05,171 --> 03:27:12,194
in the ravine. There are nooks and crannies. There
are elements of ice that can be carved away. There

3035
03:27:12,194 --> 03:27:18,403
are small alcoves that could be out of sight,
lower beyond the ice steps and such, but there is

3036
03:27:18,403 --> 03:27:24,092
no extremely visible pockets or things that are
completely out of the visual sight from that

3037
03:27:24,092 --> 03:27:28,841
perch. It was designed specifically to be a place
to survey everything.

3038
03:27:28,841 --> 03:27:30,637
TALIESIN: Are there other perches?

3039
03:27:30,637 --> 03:27:35,956
MATT: From what you can see here? There are
outcroppings of stone and elements that jut out

3040
03:27:35,956 --> 03:27:39,982
naturally from the valley wall, but it's a wide
berth from each side.

3041
03:27:39,982 --> 03:27:46,397
TALIESIN: Does this seem like the only thing, or
would there be other sentry points, as well?

3042
03:27:46,397 --> 03:27:51,233
MATT: If flown to and held in, yeah. There are a
couple of other rock areas where the dragon would

3043
03:27:51,233 --> 03:27:52,984
be able to hold himself, but this is
definitively--

3044
03:27:52,984 --> 03:27:54,194
LIAM: Is this the highest?

3045
03:27:54,194 --> 03:27:55,633
MATT: Which one?

3046
03:27:55,633 --> 03:27:56,721
LIAM: The highest.

3047
03:27:56,721 --> 03:27:59,706
TRAVIS: The highest point.

3048
03:27:59,706 --> 03:28:01,938
TALIESIN: So we have a really good vantage right
now.

3049
03:28:01,938 --> 03:28:04,892
MATT: From here, yeah. This is the highest point
in the ravine.

3050
03:28:04,892 --> 03:28:08,853
TALIESIN: Do we see the orb? Do we see an orb?

3051
03:28:08,853 --> 03:28:11,584
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3052
03:28:11,584 --> 03:28:13,095
SAM: Can I help?

3053
03:28:13,095 --> 03:28:14,762
LAURA: We're all looking.

3054
03:28:14,762 --> 03:28:19,346
TALIESIN: There we go. See? That wasn't great.

3055
03:28:19,346 --> 03:28:20,722
SAM: 28.

3056
03:28:20,722 --> 03:28:22,058
TALIESIN: 11.

3057
03:28:22,058 --> 03:28:24,670
LIAM: 17.

3058
03:28:24,670 --> 03:28:26,001
LAURA: 16.

3059
03:28:26,001 --> 03:28:27,143
TRAVIS: Nine!

3060
03:28:27,143 --> 03:28:32,285
MATT: You guys take a while glancing about.
Nothing. Scanlan, you dart down and begin peering

3061
03:28:32,285 --> 03:28:39,535
up against the ice walls that surround it. Going
down into the actual scooping bowl of this dragon

3062
03:28:39,535 --> 03:28:45,459
nest, and looking down, you can see a little
glimmer of light that refracts at a different

3063
03:28:45,459 --> 03:28:50,915
angle than the rest of the ice. A spherical
surface is visible about two and a half feet

3064
03:28:50,915 --> 03:28:52,056
below.

3065
03:28:52,056 --> 03:29:02,805
SAM: Okay. Do we smash it? Do we use it to make a
crank call? What do we do with it? Steal it?

3066
03:29:02,805 --> 03:29:09,553
LAURA: They'll be able to scry on us for sure if
we steal it. They see us. The minute we looked

3067
03:29:09,553 --> 03:29:11,702
into Brimscythe's.

3068
03:29:11,702 --> 03:29:17,493
SAM: I could do a Vorugal voice and say: Thordak,
you're a cock!

3069
03:29:17,493 --> 03:29:19,846
TALIESIN: We don't actually know his voice.

3070
03:29:19,846 --> 03:29:27,505
SAM: I could say: Thordak, I'm in desperate need
of pay!

3071
03:29:27,505 --> 03:29:29,491
LAURA: Do you speak dragon?

3072
03:29:29,491 --> 03:29:36,759
SAM: I guess you'll have to do that. What do we
do? Do we break it so he can't communicate with

3073
03:29:36,759 --> 03:29:39,438
the outside? That way when we kill him, he can't
call for help.

3074
03:29:39,438 --> 03:29:43,100
TRAVIS: If we do, then we violate what we said we
were going to do.

3075
03:29:43,100 --> 03:29:46,777
SAM: What did we say we would to do? I have a
great idea for how to kill this fucker.

3076
03:29:46,777 --> 03:29:48,590
LAURA: You have a great idea of how to kill it?

3077
03:29:48,590 --> 03:30:00,632
SAM: Well, I have an idea. Tooma told us that they
bring animals to hunt. We could be one of those

3078
03:30:00,632 --> 03:30:03,564
animals and draw it to a certain spot.

3079
03:30:03,564 --> 03:30:05,574
TALIESIN: And draw it to a certain spot?

3080
03:30:05,574 --> 03:30:07,285
SAM: Where we kill it.

3081
03:30:07,285 --> 03:30:08,760
TALIESIN: With our...

3082
03:30:08,760 --> 03:30:14,907
SAM: With our army of fucking Draconians and our
ice thing that we've shaped into some sort of a trap.

3083
03:30:14,907 --> 03:30:18,577
TALIESIN: I get a distinct impression that it is
not impressed by ice.

3084
03:30:18,577 --> 03:30:22,751
SAM: Fire trap. Rock trap.

3085
03:30:22,751 --> 03:30:27,124
MATT: And you're saying this out loud amongst the
crew, right?

3086
03:30:27,124 --> 03:30:28,292
SAM: Just us.

3087
03:30:28,292 --> 03:30:29,335
MATT: Okay.

3088
03:30:29,335 --> 03:30:30,640
SAM: Oh shit.

3089
03:30:30,640 --> 03:30:32,853
MARISHA: The ears have walls.

3090
03:30:32,853 --> 03:30:36,860
LAURA: And also, you're right in front of the
scrying circle.

3091
03:30:36,860 --> 03:30:39,194
LIAM: It's buried by ice.

3092
03:30:39,194 --> 03:30:42,844
MARISHA: It's buried by ice, but that doesn't mean
it doesn't work.

3093
03:30:42,844 --> 03:30:45,811
MATT: As soon as you called them Draconians, there
were a few hisses from the nearby crew.

3094
03:30:45,811 --> 03:30:48,289
MARISHA: The Ravenites.

3095
03:30:48,289 --> 03:30:50,189
TALIESIN: Do they speak Common?

3096
03:30:50,189 --> 03:30:54,034
LIAM: Some of them do. We spoke to them in
Common.

3097
03:30:54,034 --> 03:30:56,201
LAURA: We spoke to Tooma in Common.

3098
03:30:56,201 --> 03:30:57,753
TALIESIN: Let's make a plan.

3099
03:30:57,753 --> 03:31:02,345
SAM: I just did. I made a plan. It's an ambush
plan.

3100
03:31:02,345 --> 03:31:05,180
TALIESIN: Okay, and then we go home and the
dragons are at war. Then what?

3101
03:31:05,180 --> 03:31:08,584
SAM: What do you mean, the dragons are at war?
There's only two more dragons at that point. We

3102
03:31:08,584 --> 03:31:09,813
killed three-fifths of them.

3103
03:31:09,813 --> 03:31:15,296
LAURA: If we attack one dragon, we start the war.
That is something we've been told over and over.

3104
03:31:15,296 --> 03:31:18,537
SAM: What does that even mean? We've already
attacked two dragons. There's been no war.

3105
03:31:18,537 --> 03:31:22,323
LAURA: Once one more is dead, they'll probably all
attack.

3106
03:31:22,323 --> 03:31:23,687
SAM: Attack what?

3107
03:31:23,687 --> 03:31:29,340
LIAM: They'll stop playing nice. They'll start
destroying.

3108
03:31:29,340 --> 03:31:31,665
SAM: We have to kill them at some point.

3109
03:31:31,665 --> 03:31:33,719
TALIESIN: Yes, and now is not that point.

3110
03:31:33,719 --> 03:31:39,535
LAURA: The greatest plan we have is what Grog came
up with, which is pitting them against each

3111
03:31:39,535 --> 03:31:40,603
other.

3112
03:31:40,603 --> 03:31:42,945
SAM: All right, so how do we use this orb to do
that right now?

3113
03:31:42,945 --> 03:31:44,839
MARISHA: Do we have to use the orb?

3114
03:31:44,839 --> 03:31:46,045
SAM: That's why we came here!

3115
03:31:46,045 --> 03:31:50,061
LAURA: We came here to find out what its lair
looked like.

3116
03:31:50,061 --> 03:31:55,139
TALIESIN: What we are going to need is we need to
sneak you in there, and we need you to take a

3117
03:31:55,139 --> 03:31:56,738
movement.

3118
03:31:56,738 --> 03:31:58,194
SAM: What does that mean?

3119
03:31:58,194 --> 03:31:59,892
LIAM: A poo, Scanlan.

3120
03:31:59,892 --> 03:32:01,948
SAM: I can't do it anymore.

3121
03:32:01,948 --> 03:32:03,923
LAURA and LIAM: What?!

3122
03:32:03,923 --> 03:32:10,062
SAM: I used my last magic poo to look at my
daughter.

3123
03:32:10,062 --> 03:32:15,576
LIAM: What a sentence! What a sentence.

3124
03:32:15,576 --> 03:32:19,055
LAURA: In every aspect, Scanlan, disgusting.

3125
03:32:19,055 --> 03:32:20,778
MATT: That's the next t-shirt.

3126
03:32:20,778 --> 03:32:25,596
TRAVIS: That's amazing. I used my last magic poo
to look at my daughter!

3127
03:32:25,596 --> 03:32:31,638
SAM: I need to know where she is. I need to know
she's okay. Gilmore can maybe make me some more

3128
03:32:31,638 --> 03:32:36,895
potion, but I haven't wanted to bother him about
it because he's busy keeping a shield around

3129
03:32:36,895 --> 03:32:37,966
Whitestone.

3130
03:32:37,966 --> 03:32:39,328
LAURA: Don't!

3131
03:32:39,328 --> 03:32:40,197
SAM: Shit.

3132
03:32:40,197 --> 03:32:42,431
LAURA: You didn't say that out loud. You did not
just say that out loud.

3133
03:32:42,431 --> 03:32:43,806
SAM: I said it in an accent.

3134
03:32:43,806 --> 03:32:45,762
MATT: That was out loud.

3135
03:32:45,762 --> 03:32:48,442
MARISHA: All right. Hang on. Let's think about
this for a minute.

3136
03:32:48,442 --> 03:32:53,004
LAURA: Can we just step away from the orb while we
talk?

3137
03:32:53,004 --> 03:32:54,356
MARISHA: Yeah, let's do that.

3138
03:32:54,356 --> 03:32:56,663
TALIESIN: We're not near the orb. We're near the
Draconians, aren't we?

3139
03:32:56,663 --> 03:32:58,790
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Ravenites.

3140
03:32:58,790 --> 03:33:04,103
MATT: They're still all gathered around the base.
They walked you here and they're basically

3141
03:33:04,103 --> 03:33:08,996
watching you set up for this ambush preparation or
gathering. They're not going to leave you to your

3142
03:33:08,996 --> 03:33:11,622
own devices. They're still not quite sure of
everything.

3143
03:33:11,622 --> 03:33:15,843
LAURA: Can we sketch what it looks like? I think
you should sketch, Percy.

3144
03:33:15,843 --> 03:33:20,941
SAM: We need to use this opportunity. We're never
going to be in this dragon's lair again! This is

3145
03:33:20,941 --> 03:33:24,193
it. Crack the thing. Set a trap. Burn it down.

3146
03:33:24,193 --> 03:33:25,792
TRAVIS: I have a suggestion.

3147
03:33:25,792 --> 03:33:27,196
SAM: Yes, Grog, you're the best.

3148
03:33:27,196 --> 03:33:34,733
TRAVIS: The white dragon is primal, right? He
likes to hunt creatures. We've got to go now. We

3149
03:33:34,733 --> 03:33:39,699
leave. We leave them alone. That way we're not in
danger, they're not in danger. We promise to come

3150
03:33:39,699 --> 03:33:45,826
back, not only with forces to help remove the
white dragon, but also with something for it to

3151
03:33:45,826 --> 03:33:49,373
hunt. That way we're not fighting it in its
fucking lair.

3152
03:33:49,373 --> 03:33:51,230
TALIESIN: We know a lot already.

3153
03:33:51,230 --> 03:33:53,118
SAM: I can pretend to be a beast.

3154
03:33:53,118 --> 03:33:57,982
TALIESIN: Scanlan, why would you bother to pretend
to be a beast? If he just finds you, he'll hunt

3155
03:33:57,982 --> 03:33:59,233
you and kill you.

3156
03:33:59,233 --> 03:34:02,695
TRAVIS: We know that there are people that will
work with us. We know what the terrain looks like.

3157
03:34:02,695 --> 03:34:06,540
We know what his lair looks like, which we don't
want to be in when we fight him. And we know how

3158
03:34:06,540 --> 03:34:09,806
to get him out of it, possibly. It's a pretty
successful trip.

3159
03:34:09,806 --> 03:34:13,848
LIAM: One possibility is we could come back with
Galdric, and he and I could play bait.

3160
03:34:13,848 --> 03:34:16,171
SAM: Galdric is the wolf, right?

3161
03:34:16,171 --> 03:34:21,110
LIAM: He's a big fucking wolf.

3162
03:34:21,110 --> 03:34:27,676
TALIESIN: We've made allies. We've got a look at
everything. We know the terrain, and we know the

3163
03:34:27,676 --> 03:34:29,079
political terrain.

3164
03:34:29,079 --> 03:34:32,115
LAURA: Maybe Urukat would want to come and fight a
dragon.

3165
03:34:32,115 --> 03:34:33,569
MARISHA: He might.

3166
03:34:33,569 --> 03:34:38,300
TALIESIN: I will also add that we can leave them
with something.

3167
03:34:38,300 --> 03:34:42,434
MARISHA: That's what I was thinking. Maybe this
isn't about destroying something. Maybe it's about

3168
03:34:42,434 --> 03:34:50,303
planting something. If we destroy anything, the
dragon's going to immediately blame the locals.

3169
03:34:50,303 --> 03:34:53,359
LAURA: What would we leave? I don't want them able
to scry on us.

3170
03:34:53,359 --> 03:34:54,841
TRAVIS: How about a little wine?

3171
03:34:54,841 --> 03:34:56,893
TALIESIN: How about a small grove of trees?

3172
03:34:56,893 --> 03:34:59,825
MARISHA: I could leave trees.

3173
03:34:59,825 --> 03:35:01,458
TRAVIS: They did want trees.

3174
03:35:01,458 --> 03:35:04,082
LAURA: I could leave trees, too.

3175
03:35:04,082 --> 03:35:12,207
MARISHA: We also have this Scrying Eye. Can I use
this remotely?

3176
03:35:12,207 --> 03:35:15,179
MATT: No, you have to have it in your hands to
utilize it.

3177
03:35:15,179 --> 03:35:17,683
TALIESIN: It's all right.

3178
03:35:17,683 --> 03:35:19,376
TRAVIS: I like the tree idea.

3179
03:35:19,376 --> 03:35:31,657
LAURA: Tooma, just in case something happens and a
big red dragon comes to pick a fight, everyone

3180
03:35:31,657 --> 03:35:33,946
hide. Get out of the way.

3181
03:35:33,946 --> 03:35:40,212
MATT: "I appreciate the advice. I can guarantee
you there would be no other course of action."

3182
03:35:40,212 --> 03:35:45,354
SAM: Can we carve in the lair "Thordak was here"
or something?

3183
03:35:45,354 --> 03:35:48,231
LIAM: They'll know it was you.

3184
03:35:48,231 --> 03:35:50,968
LAURA: I think we got the information--

3185
03:35:50,968 --> 03:35:58,105
TRAVIS: Tooma. Forgive me, I'm not the best
speaker, but we have learned from fighting these

3186
03:35:58,105 --> 03:36:04,053
dragons that if we fight them in their lair, we
are at a severe disadvantage.

3187
03:36:04,053 --> 03:36:07,045
MATT: "Then get it from its lair."

3188
03:36:07,045 --> 03:36:09,385
TRAVIS: We are of a mind on that.

3189
03:36:09,385 --> 03:36:11,902
LAURA: What kind of creatures do you offer to it
for hunt?

3190
03:36:11,902 --> 03:36:20,867
MATT: "It is growing bored with dire beasts. We've
even brought it to the ocean, where there were

3191
03:36:20,867 --> 03:36:35,247
"some great terrors beneath the sea, but it tore
them asunder. There are, northward, large

3192
03:36:35,247 --> 03:36:47,690
"segmented insect-like creatures they call the
remorhaz. That was a scuffle, but I fear the

3193
03:36:47,690 --> 03:36:49,512
"dragon grows bored."

3194
03:36:49,512 --> 03:36:53,377
SAM: Got to go find us a beast and bring it here.

3195
03:36:53,377 --> 03:36:55,692
TALIESIN: No, I've got a better idea.

3196
03:36:55,692 --> 03:36:57,929
LIAM: Spit it out.

3197
03:36:57,929 --> 03:37:09,998
TALIESIN: Once we've gathered some resources, when
we return, we prepare to attack post-hunt. Once it

3198
03:37:09,998 --> 03:37:15,824
has exhausted itself on something large and angry,
that is when we strike the dragon.

3199
03:37:15,824 --> 03:37:19,718
LAURA: How will we be able to communicate with
them, for them to let us know?

3200
03:37:19,718 --> 03:37:21,677
SAM: We'll be here the whole time.

3201
03:37:21,677 --> 03:37:28,994
TALIESIN: When we come back, we stay until it's
time. When we come back, it is to end this.

3202
03:37:28,994 --> 03:37:31,926
LIAM: For now, we leave a back-door entrance.

3203
03:37:31,926 --> 03:37:37,519
TALIESIN: With the trees, we will know how to
return quickly with a force.

3204
03:37:37,519 --> 03:37:43,083
MARISHA: This might be something we go to the
Slayer's Take for. They always have a roster of

3205
03:37:43,083 --> 03:37:44,415
big beasts.

3206
03:37:44,415 --> 03:37:52,245
TALIESIN: With a little bit of information, we
could even keep them informed of things for it to

3207
03:37:52,245 --> 03:37:58,941
kill that they may find around here, with the
Slayer's Take's help. We can keep you in supply of

3208
03:37:58,941 --> 03:38:01,077
things to amuse it.

3209
03:38:01,077 --> 03:38:07,193
MATT: "I trust you know what you say. These words
mean nothing to me."

3210
03:38:07,193 --> 03:38:16,198
TALIESIN: We are sorry that this cannot end as
quickly as would be agreeable. We can do our best

3211
03:38:16,198 --> 03:38:28,468
to help make you comfortable, and if you need some
proof of the power that we wield, we can offer a

3212
03:38:28,468 --> 03:38:41,459
token. I have a thought. But if you wish, a token
of our power.

3213
03:38:41,459 --> 03:38:55,369
MATT: "How about this. I trust you to return.
Let's set a time, so we know where the limits are.

3214
03:38:55,369 --> 03:38:59,488
"Eight days."

3215
03:38:59,488 --> 03:39:02,737
MARISHA: Wow. That's soon.

3216
03:39:02,737 --> 03:39:12,753
TALIESIN: We can send a beast before, perhaps, but
our travel is long. We may need more time. We have

3217
03:39:12,753 --> 03:39:14,498
two more continents.

3218
03:39:14,498 --> 03:39:16,581
MATT: "How much time do you need?"

3219
03:39:16,581 --> 03:39:20,369
LAURA and TALIESIN: Two weeks.

3220
03:39:20,369 --> 03:39:22,387
MATT: "Two weeks?"

3221
03:39:22,387 --> 03:39:29,723
TALIESIN: Continents. Further than you have walked
in your life. We move quickly, but there is only

3222
03:39:29,723 --> 03:39:31,982
so much that can be done.

3223
03:39:31,982 --> 03:39:44,636
MATT: "Two weeks. 14 sun cycles past. If we do not
hear from you, the Frigid Doom is known to this

3224
03:39:44,636 --> 03:39:46,613
"Whitestone you speak."

3225
03:39:46,613 --> 03:39:48,672
LAURA: Fucking shit balls, Scanlan.

3226
03:39:48,672 --> 03:39:50,587
LIAM: They're extorting us.

3227
03:39:50,587 --> 03:39:58,078
MATT: "Not extorting. Making sure you are of your
word, because otherwise you leave us here to die

3228
03:39:58,078 --> 03:40:00,556
"on promises that are fake and false."

3229
03:40:00,556 --> 03:40:02,730
LIAM: To-may-to, to-mah-to.

3230
03:40:02,730 --> 03:40:04,562
LAURA: We don't do that.

3231
03:40:04,562 --> 03:40:07,309
MATT: "Good. Then we'll see you before two weeks
is out."

3232
03:40:07,309 --> 03:40:10,178
LAURA: Yep.

3233
03:40:10,178 --> 03:40:20,739
MARISHA: I will leave you with a parting gift. I
will leave you with a grove of trees that should

3234
03:40:20,739 --> 03:40:22,370
be ever-growing and present.

3235
03:40:22,370 --> 03:40:26,808
LAURA: If you do that, he'll know something is
different.

3236
03:40:26,808 --> 03:40:27,885
MARISHA: He will.

3237
03:40:27,885 --> 03:40:31,935
TALIESIN: No. We plant one tree.

3238
03:40:31,935 --> 03:40:33,839
MARISHA: One?

3239
03:40:33,839 --> 03:40:39,357
TALIESIN: No, we have to plant some trees. Find a
place that is secret.

3240
03:40:39,357 --> 03:40:44,870
MARISHA: I can plant these trees anywhere. Just
need solid ground.

3241
03:40:44,870 --> 03:40:46,863
TRAVIS: If you can get away from the city--

3242
03:40:46,863 --> 03:40:48,607
MARISHA: I can possibly do it subterranean.

3243
03:40:48,607 --> 03:40:53,993
MATT: "There is solid ground here. Up there, above
the ravine, wherever else you need it to be."

3244
03:40:53,993 --> 03:41:01,285
MARISHA: Where does the dragon not tread? Where do
you know he will not see the trees?

3245
03:41:01,285 --> 03:41:07,307
MATT: "Probably out of the ravine. He stalks
inside quite extensively."

3246
03:41:07,307 --> 03:41:12,085
TALIESIN: Let's find a place. This will be where
we leave, anyway.

3247
03:41:12,085 --> 03:41:23,732
SAM: Tooma. I have one more question about Gern
Blanston. I raise the hand cone, and I cast

3248
03:41:23,732 --> 03:41:27,681
Modify Memory on her.

3249
03:41:27,681 --> 03:41:40,916
TRAVIS: Oh no. Oh jeez. Oh man, I love it.

3250
03:41:40,916 --> 03:41:43,400
LIAM: Look at Matt's face.

3251
03:41:43,400 --> 03:41:46,101
MATT: Okay.

3252
03:41:46,101 --> 03:41:48,515
LAURA: We're about to get attacked.

3253
03:41:48,515 --> 03:41:51,344
TALIESIN: No, we're about to run.

3254
03:41:51,344 --> 03:41:53,004
LIAM: Can I roll my initiative in advance?

3255
03:41:53,004 --> 03:41:58,823
MATT: There we go. All right, what's the DC?

3256
03:41:58,823 --> 03:42:01,099
SAM: 21.

3257
03:42:01,099 --> 03:42:04,881
MATT: What are you trying to do?

3258
03:42:04,881 --> 03:42:13,340
SAM: I'm trying to change the moment that I said
"Whitestone" into "Emon."

3259
03:42:13,340 --> 03:42:27,028
MATT: You watch as she leans in, and she shakes
her head for a minute and goes, "What was your

3260
03:42:27,028 --> 03:42:30,326
"question? I do not know these words you speak."

3261
03:42:30,326 --> 03:42:32,935
SAM: Candles. Have you ever met a candle-maker?

3262
03:42:32,935 --> 03:42:34,431
MATT: "I know not of a candle-maker."

3263
03:42:34,431 --> 03:42:38,442
TALIESIN: I do have a request on our way out.

3264
03:42:38,442 --> 03:42:39,802
MATT: "What is your request?"

3265
03:42:39,802 --> 03:42:48,603
TALIESIN: Would the dragon notice if any of these
bodies were disturbed?

3266
03:42:48,603 --> 03:43:02,308
MATT: "Many, yes. But small amounts... why? If you
wish to take what they have, they mean nothing to

3267
03:43:02,308 --> 03:43:05,836
"us. One or two turned over will make no difference
to the dragon."

3268
03:43:05,836 --> 03:43:10,614
TALIESIN: Pull that one down, then.

3269
03:43:10,614 --> 03:43:21,709
MATT: "Right." She points to it. Some of the
Ravenites come over and haul one of the corpses

3270
03:43:21,709 --> 03:43:27,197
off of the spike. It breaks off and snaps, and
they bring it and throw it to the ground and step back.

3271
03:43:27,197 --> 03:43:43,298
TALIESIN: Thank you. (sighs) It is exactly what I
expect, I would assume.

3272
03:43:43,298 --> 03:43:47,128
MATT: The robes are familiar. The scale color is
familiar.

3273
03:43:47,128 --> 03:43:51,948
TALIESIN: I look it over. I check.

3274
03:43:51,948 --> 03:44:08,052
MATT: There, locked in the moments of valiant
defense of his city, frozen and lost, the remains

3275
03:44:08,052 --> 03:44:20,904
of Tiberius Stormwind, left a hero defending his
people, defaced by Vorugal the Frigid Doom.

3276
03:44:30,059 --> 03:44:33,121
TALIESIN: Let's bring him inside, at least.

3277
03:44:33,121 --> 03:44:49,513
TRAVIS: Yeah. I go and I gather the remains.

3278
03:44:49,513 --> 03:44:53,852
MATT: They are stiff and frozen, but light enough
for you to carry.

3279
03:44:53,852 --> 03:45:02,231
LIAM: Where are we taking him?

3280
03:45:02,231 --> 03:45:10,135
TALIESIN: I don't know. The remnants of the
library, perhaps. The ground's too hard to bury.

3281
03:45:10,135 --> 03:45:18,326
MARISHA: We can't even pretend like he was our
friend.

3282
03:45:18,326 --> 03:45:22,568
TALIESIN: No. We absolutely cannot.

3283
03:45:22,568 --> 03:45:39,597
TRAVIS: I have a horrible thought. If we move him,
will the dragon know we were here?

3284
03:45:39,597 --> 03:45:42,202
SAM: Was he on one of those stakes?

3285
03:45:42,202 --> 03:45:49,973
TALIESIN: He was. No, I checked. Unless he's very
clever and very keen, and I don't think they are.

3286
03:45:49,973 --> 03:46:03,775
I think that if they knew, he would be in a more
exalted position of defacement. I think this is

3287
03:46:03,775 --> 03:46:16,129
just slaughter. Things vanish. I'm all right with
making this vanish. That's as much of a calling

3288
03:46:16,129 --> 03:46:18,438
card as I feel we need to leave.

3289
03:46:18,438 --> 03:46:20,775
TRAVIS: Where should we bring him?

3290
03:46:20,775 --> 03:46:23,759
SAM: His home doesn't really exist anymore.

3291
03:46:23,759 --> 03:46:26,792
MARISHA: His home was with us.

3292
03:46:26,792 --> 03:46:28,685
LAURA: Back to Emon.

3293
03:46:28,685 --> 03:46:30,349
TALIESIN: I have a thought.

3294
03:46:30,349 --> 03:46:35,802
LIAM: To our keep. It was very important to him.

3295
03:46:35,802 --> 03:46:37,927
SAM: This is his place.

3296
03:46:37,927 --> 03:46:42,232
TALIESIN: We're not bringing him to us. We're
leaving him here, but we're putting him somewhere

3297
03:46:42,232 --> 03:46:43,731
appropriate.

3298
03:46:43,731 --> 03:46:50,121
LIAM: We'd take him away. Can you melt ice and
snow, and we'll lay him here?

3299
03:46:50,121 --> 03:46:52,263
TALIESIN: Put him with the books.

3300
03:46:52,263 --> 03:46:54,213
LAURA: He always loved them.

3301
03:46:54,213 --> 03:47:05,219
SAM: For now, anyway. And then when we free this
place, we can find a proper tomb for him.

3302
03:47:05,219 --> 03:47:12,087
TRAVIS: We take him back to where the frozen books
lay.

3303
03:47:12,087 --> 03:47:20,000
MATT: You find the remnants of the library. As you
find a section of the stone rubble that's loose

3304
03:47:20,000 --> 03:47:25,234
enough, you pull it open, and there beneath, you
can see there are hundreds and hundreds of books,

3305
03:47:25,234 --> 03:47:34,282
many still pristine, if a little soggy from the
melted snow. You gather a lot of time was spent in

3306
03:47:34,282 --> 03:47:41,425
this library in his youth, and it's probably as
good a place as any to leave his memory for the time.

3307
03:47:41,425 --> 03:47:44,991
LAURA: Are any of the Ravenites around us, or are
we alone?

3308
03:47:44,991 --> 03:47:56,543
MATT: They're keeping their distance, but they're
watching. You get the sense that they understand

3309
03:47:56,543 --> 03:48:02,834
what's going on, but they're not taking any
offense to it.

3310
03:48:02,834 --> 03:48:07,744
TALIESIN: This will do.

3311
03:48:07,744 --> 03:48:10,427
LIAM: I start pulling books out.

3312
03:48:10,427 --> 03:48:12,653
MARISHA: I start melting ice.

3313
03:48:12,653 --> 03:48:18,279
LAURA: Is Lockheed still on my shoulder?

3314
03:48:18,279 --> 03:48:20,699
MATT: Lockheed is still on your shoulder.

3315
03:48:20,699 --> 03:48:24,544
LAURA: I bring him down so he can say goodbye.

3316
03:48:24,544 --> 03:48:36,568
MATT: As the ice melts, color comes to the body.
You can see the tattered robes that show a fierce

3317
03:48:36,568 --> 03:48:51,152
battle was fought. Regardless of this condition of
finding him, knowing him as well as you did, he

3318
03:48:51,152 --> 03:49:02,539
still probably left a hero. As you lay him down on
the books, mostly thawed now, Lockheed finds a

3319
03:49:02,539 --> 03:49:11,516
moment of recognition and immediately flutters
onto his chest and curls up, mews a bit, nibbles

3320
03:49:11,516 --> 03:49:13,737
at the chin.

3321
03:49:13,737 --> 03:49:28,703
LIAM: I'm going to sit three or four feet away
from him, facing him, and start privately thanking

3322
03:49:28,703 --> 03:49:34,689
the Raven Queen for ushering him on.

3323
03:49:34,689 --> 03:49:45,134
TRAVIS: I'm going to take a chalice out of the bag
of holding, and I begin to fill it with ale, and

3324
03:49:45,134 --> 03:49:53,544
then remember he preferred water, and I take the
alchemy jug and I pour fresh water into the

3325
03:49:53,544 --> 03:49:55,782
chalice and lay it with him.

3326
03:49:55,782 --> 03:50:01,673
MARISHA: I take and I rip off a piece of his
robes. Tuck it away.

3327
03:50:01,673 --> 03:50:04,628
TALIESIN: Can you seal it?

3328
03:50:04,628 --> 03:50:14,426
MATT: As you guys step back, the nearby stone
clatters to life.

3329
03:50:14,426 --> 03:50:20,638
LAURA: I get Lockheed out of there. I don't want
him to stay in. Do you want to come?

3330
03:50:20,638 --> 03:50:23,673
MATT: Lockheed resists and resists and doesn't
want to leave.

3331
03:50:23,673 --> 03:50:27,967
LAURA: In Draconic I say: It's all right.

3332
03:50:27,967 --> 03:50:37,903
MATT: Lockheed curls up onto his face and nibbles
a bit on the forehead, then turns back and

3333
03:50:37,903 --> 03:50:46,242
flutters up onto your shoulder. The stonework
clatters closed over the top of the rubble of the

3334
03:50:46,242 --> 03:50:47,738
library.

3335
03:50:47,738 --> 03:50:52,270
MARISHA: Keyleth drops to her knees and starts
crying.

3336
03:50:52,270 --> 03:51:07,475
MATT: Vax. In this moment of sadness, there is a
bit of warmth, as you sense, though remote as it

3337
03:51:07,475 --> 03:51:15,633
is through the Divine Gate, the Raven Queen's
assurance that his spirit has made it to the other side.

3338
03:51:15,633 --> 03:51:27,521
LAURA: I put my hand on Keyleth's shoulder. He
loved you well, princess.

3339
03:51:27,521 --> 03:51:33,591
MARISHA: He was so stupid.

3340
03:51:33,591 --> 03:51:42,144
LIAM: He meant well.

3341
03:51:42,144 --> 03:51:44,723
TALIESIN: I'm going to find Tooma. Is she behind
us?

3342
03:51:44,723 --> 03:51:47,182
MARISHA: He should have never left our side.

3343
03:51:47,182 --> 03:52:00,506
TALIESIN: Hopefully, this war will go on schedule.
But there's our promise. That's the best you're

3344
03:52:00,506 --> 03:52:04,691
going to get. I head out.

3345
03:52:04,691 --> 03:52:09,430
MARISHA: I follow Percy.

3346
03:52:09,430 --> 03:52:21,087
SAM: I turn around and say: Goodbye, old friend.
We'll come back and we'll fix this. Because this

3347
03:52:21,087 --> 03:52:33,679
is... poppycock.

3348
03:52:33,679 --> 03:52:45,176
MATT: As you gather yourselves up, here amongst
the ruins of Draconia, the last of the sky's

3349
03:52:45,176 --> 03:52:53,542
light, the sun has faded and the night has taken
its form. You hear the distant caws of the evening

3350
03:52:53,542 --> 03:53:00,843
birds as they begin to take to the skies above the
ravine. Tooma and the rest of the Ravenites give a

3351
03:53:00,843 --> 03:53:06,932
nod as you join hands. Keyleth?

3352
03:53:06,932 --> 03:53:08,887
MARISHA: Let's go home.

3353
03:53:08,887 --> 03:53:12,696
TALIESIN: Yes, let's. There's much to do.

3354
03:53:12,696 --> 03:53:15,041
MARISHA: Back to Whitestone.

3355
03:53:15,041 --> 03:53:21,475
LAURA: Were you going to leave a tree?

3356
03:53:21,475 --> 03:53:24,444
MARISHA: Yeah.

3357
03:53:24,444 --> 03:53:30,434
TALIESIN: We let them know where the grove would
be found, before we left them.

3358
03:53:30,434 --> 03:53:36,823
MARISHA: I do Plant Growth. Make a big old tree.

3359
03:53:36,823 --> 03:53:44,322
MATT: All righty. Where do you create the tree?

3360
03:53:44,322 --> 03:53:48,267
MARISHA: Wherever we decided it was best to create
the tree.

3361
03:53:48,267 --> 03:53:49,912
LAURA: Outside of the ravine.

3362
03:53:49,912 --> 03:53:52,825
TALIESIN: At the top. A little grove of trees.

3363
03:53:52,825 --> 03:54:00,564
MATT: Which, with a simple use of the broom or
wild shape, you can make your way up there, find a

3364
03:54:00,564 --> 03:54:05,327
small patch of bushes, create a single tree that
didn't exist there previously, a small sapling now

3365
03:54:05,327 --> 03:54:20,321
grown to full height. The bastion of a promise to
be kept. Keyleth returns. You take hands. You step

3366
03:54:20,321 --> 03:54:24,987
through the nearest tree as the portal opens, and
find yourself emerging from the other side of the

3367
03:54:24,987 --> 03:54:26,764
Sun Tree, back in Whitestone.

3368
03:54:26,764 --> 03:54:30,785
MARISHA: I give the Sun Tree a little pat.

3369
03:54:30,785 --> 03:54:39,367
MATT: The morning sun begins to rise.

3370
03:54:39,367 --> 03:54:48,926
TALIESIN: We'll report what we've seen. We'll try
to gain our bearings again, get sleep tonight.

3371
03:54:48,926 --> 03:55:01,753
We'll report what we've seen in the new room. No
one else. And we will never utter this city's name

3372
03:55:01,753 --> 03:55:03,614
outside these walls again.

3373
03:55:03,614 --> 03:55:08,230
SAM: Totally. Dick move.

3374
03:55:08,230 --> 03:55:16,217
MATT: You find yourselves to rest, keeping
memories fresh untill sleep takes you.

3375
03:55:16,217 --> 03:55:23,192
MARISHA: Knock on Vax's door.

3376
03:55:23,192 --> 03:55:25,425
SAM: Oh god.

3377
03:55:25,425 --> 03:55:31,987
MATT: All right. As everyone else is going to
rest, Keyleth, you find your way to Vax's door.

3378
03:55:31,987 --> 03:55:36,170
MARISHA: Can I stay with you tonight?

3379
03:55:36,170 --> 03:55:44,032
LIAM: I don't fuck anything up with words, and I
open the door.

3380
03:55:44,032 --> 03:55:45,543
SAM: What?

3381
03:55:45,543 --> 03:55:51,397
LIAM: I'm not going to fuck it up by saying
anything. I open the door.

3382
03:55:51,397 --> 03:55:53,829
MARISHA: I just go in.

3383
03:55:53,829 --> 03:56:02,876
MATT: Whether or not you are taking the time to
sleep or ruminate on the events, as it's only been

3384
03:56:02,876 --> 03:56:11,651
half a day since last you woke up, you take some
time with Lockheed. He eats a little more food and

3385
03:56:11,651 --> 03:56:18,587
leaps to the window of your room, and then takes
off over the rest of Whitestone.

3386
03:56:18,587 --> 03:56:30,833
You process this time, this moment, this memory,
and realize how much has been lost through this

3387
03:56:30,833 --> 03:56:40,334
journey, but yet how much is worth saving. How
much is worth fighting for. And then, as much as

3388
03:56:40,334 --> 03:56:48,540
you bunch of fuck-up misfits that came together as
friends years ago have come to a point of

3389
03:56:48,540 --> 03:56:52,371
understanding your true worth and what the
importance is of really standing up for the things

3390
03:56:52,371 --> 03:56:59,937
that you believe in in this world, and the people
that need protecting, and know that the next step

3391
03:56:59,937 --> 03:57:05,739
of your journey should come soon. Whether you
stand or fall, this is the fight that needs to be

3392
03:57:05,739 --> 03:57:14,682
fought. And with luck be at your side, that
terrible fucking dragon will meet its end soon

3393
03:57:14,682 --> 03:57:18,181
enough.

3394
03:57:18,181 --> 03:57:21,199
And with that we'll pick up next week on
Thursday.

3395
03:57:21,199 --> 03:57:24,955
TALIESIN: Glad we decided to take a light-hearted
game.

3396
03:57:24,955 --> 03:57:28,062
SAM: It's a fun romp after the Feywild, a fun
romp.

3397
03:57:28,062 --> 03:57:30,563
LIAM: Bar hop! Bar crawl!

3398
03:57:30,563 --> 03:57:40,537
MARISHA: I need a stiff drink.

3399
03:57:40,537 --> 03:57:45,281
MATT: I was simultaneously looking forward to and
not looking forward to the return to Draconia for

3400
03:57:45,281 --> 03:57:46,832
that reason.

3401
03:57:46,832 --> 03:57:49,695
LAURA: Man.

3402
03:57:49,695 --> 03:57:52,162
MATT: We'll pick it up next week, guys.

3403
03:57:52,162 --> 03:57:54,675
MARISHA: Yay.

3404
03:57:54,675 --> 03:58:01,163
MATT: I'm sorry. Sorry, guys. Sorry to you.

3405
03:58:01,163 --> 03:58:03,035
LAURA: Thanks, Loot Crate.

3406
03:58:03,035 --> 03:58:09,753
SAM: $3 discount.

3407
03:58:09,753 --> 03:58:13,935
TRAVIS: Pour one out for Tibs. We will be.

3408
03:58:13,935 --> 03:58:20,343
MATT: Not all narrative is bright, but it has its
purpose.

3409
03:58:20,343 --> 03:58:22,082
SAM: We're next.

3410
03:58:22,082 --> 03:58:26,226
(laughter)

3411
03:58:26,226 --> 03:58:29,871
MATT: We love you guys. Thank you for sticking
through us for an emotionally draining evening.

3412
03:58:29,871 --> 03:58:37,240
We'll be back next Thursday to see the next length
of Vox Machina's journey. Is it Thursday yet? Good night.
