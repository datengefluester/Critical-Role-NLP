1
00:00:02,345 --> 00:00:05,974
MATT: And welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

2
00:00:05,974 --> 00:00:12,649
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Tonight's
gonna be a fun one. But before we jump into it--

3
00:00:12,649 --> 00:00:15,761
LIAM: What does that mean? What does that mean?

4
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:17,379
MATT: I don't know. We ended on an interesting
note.

5
00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:18,873
MARISHA: I think I just peed a little.

6
00:00:18,873 --> 00:00:19,855
MATT: Yeah.

7
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:21,079
TRAVIS: Do y'all hear that heartbeat in your
ears?

8
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:22,069
MATT: It's weird.

9
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:22,736
MARISHA: Yeah.

10
00:00:22,736 --> 00:00:25,020
MATT: (heartbeat noise) But before we get to that,
let's go ahead and get to our opening

11
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,395
announcements. First and foremost, our glorious
returning sponsor for the evening,

12
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:31,229
our friends at Loot Crate!

13
00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:33,072
ALL: Loot Crate!

14
00:00:33,072 --> 00:00:35,887
MATT: Fantastic, awesome people. Sam, is there
something you want to talk about?

15
00:00:35,887 --> 00:00:42,289
SAM: Yeah. You know, a lot of my Loot Crate plugs
have been comedic, or cute.

16
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:43,651
Some would say clever.

17
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:44,834
TALIESIN: Debatable.

18
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:46,056
TRAVIS: I don't know if I'd go that far.

19
00:00:46,056 --> 00:00:50,020
SAM: But one thing that has been lacking is a
sense of spectacle. Of human achievement. Of

20
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,384
record breaking. So tonight I'm going to attempt
something that's never been attempted before. I'm

21
00:00:55,384 --> 00:01:00,251
going to do the Loot Crate copy read here. While
drinking an entire Coca-Cola.

22
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:01,608
LIAM: Oh no.

23
00:01:01,608 --> 00:01:08,245
SAM: And a bite-sized 100 Grand bar, Snickers bar,
Milky Way, Twix, another bite-sized Snickers bar,

24
00:01:08,295 --> 00:01:12,297
a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, and a packet of Big
League Chew.

25
00:01:12,297 --> 00:01:13,150
TRAVIS: Yes!

26
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:13,817
LIAM: Oh no.

27
00:01:13,817 --> 00:01:14,741
LAURA: What? You're going to vomit.

28
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,609
SAM: In two minutes.

29
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:16,604
LAURA: You're going to vomit, Sam.

30
00:01:16,604 --> 00:01:20,523
SAM: Also, all this stuff melted in my car.

31
00:01:20,523 --> 00:01:22,022
LIAM: Notice he's got a towel down.

32
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:23,397
MARISHA: That's actually really gross-looking.

33
00:01:23,397 --> 00:01:24,711
LAURA: Oh god! He does have a towel down.

34
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:25,791
TALIESIN: This looks unhappy.

35
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:26,692
SAM: All right. Travis?

36
00:01:26,692 --> 00:01:27,306
TRAVIS: Yeah yeah.

37
00:01:27,306 --> 00:01:28,249
SAM: You got the clock ready?

38
00:01:28,249 --> 00:01:28,738
TRAVIS: Yeah.

39
00:01:28,738 --> 00:01:33,286
SAM: Two minutes, can it be done? The answer is
no. (laughs) Ready?

40
00:01:33,286 --> 00:01:35,294
TRAVIS: Three, two, one.

41
00:01:35,294 --> 00:01:40,883
SAM: Loot Crate is a curated collection of awesome
items from the best pop culture franchises

42
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:48,255
delivered to your door every month. You get the
best and most exclusive licensed figures,

43
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:51,344
t-shirts, home goods, and more.

44
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:52,868
LAURA: Oh no.

45
00:01:52,868 --> 00:01:53,928
TRAVIS: You're doing good. You're doing good.

46
00:01:53,928 --> 00:01:54,773
LIAM: My god.

47
00:01:54,773 --> 00:01:55,607
LAURA: He's going to spew.

48
00:01:55,607 --> 00:01:56,346
MARISHA: At least it's a Mexico--

49
00:01:56,346 --> 00:01:57,749
TRAVIS: No, no, don't help him.

50
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:58,874
TALIESIN: Let it happen! Let it happen!

51
00:01:58,874 --> 00:01:59,943
SAM: Don't help me!

52
00:01:59,943 --> 00:02:01,018
MARISHA: No, we're good. It's better. It's
better.

53
00:02:01,018 --> 00:02:05,489
SAM: This week's crate theme is Primal. Featuring
awesome swag from X-Men, Overwatch and Predator.

54
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:06,731
TRAVIS: 30 seconds.

55
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:15,712
SAM: Give yourself every month or give the gift of

58
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:24,743
LAURA: Don't do it!

59
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:26,387
TALIESIN: Big League Chew! No god!

60
00:02:26,387 --> 00:02:36,427
SAM: From collectibles [inaudible]. It's like
Comic-Con in a box!

61
00:02:36,427 --> 00:02:38,949
TRAVIS: One minute.

62
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:51,421
SAM: Oh boy! How do I separate the gum from the
other stuff? Loot Crate, Loot Crate DX, Loot

63
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:56,634
Gaming, and Loot Anime. How do you want to do
this?

64
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,243
LAURA: Did you do it? Did he just do it?

65
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:00,191
TALIESIN: No, no, no.

66
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:01,537
MATT: He's still got more Coke.

67
00:03:01,537 --> 00:03:02,345
TRAVIS: The Coke's gotta go.

68
00:03:02,408 --> 00:03:03,544
TALIESIN: Gotta go!

69
00:03:03,606 --> 00:03:04,762
SAM: It can't get in.

70
00:03:04,944 --> 00:03:12,766
TRAVIS: 30 seconds left! 30 seconds left! Work it.
Work! Relax the throat.

71
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:15,666
SAM: Hold on. Not good.

72
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,271
LAURA: He's going to kill himself.

73
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:18,713
MARISHA: Don't choke.

74
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,071
SAM: Half left?!

75
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:21,093
TRAVIS: 15 seconds.

76
00:03:21,093 --> 00:03:22,439
LAURA: Sam, get that shit out of your mouth. I'm
going to throw up.

77
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,635
SAM: I can't do it! I can't do it!

78
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:24,381
TALIESIN: Don't look!

79
00:03:24,381 --> 00:03:25,309
MATT: 11!

80
00:03:25,309 --> 00:03:32,710
TRAVIS: Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Don't
stop fighting for it!

81
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,400
TALIESIN: No matter what, we're going to think
less of you, it doesn't matter anymore.

82
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,728
TRAVIS: Three! Two! One!

83
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:36,708
LIAM: Happy new year!

84
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:40,759
TRAVIS: That's it! That's it! That's it! Oh my
god, that's it.

85
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:43,950
TALIESIN: You get a participation ribbon. Well
done.

86
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:51,357
LAURA: That was so fucking gross. Samuel!

87
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:59,276
TRAVIS: Do we have an ambulance on standby?

88
00:04:00,029 --> 00:04:02,793
TALIESIN: Five years from now, your children will
be able to Google this.

89
00:04:02,793 --> 00:04:05,283
I'm just going to remind you.

90
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:11,803
MATT: If there was ever a moment in our show that
will be giffed and show up on GIPHY, that's it

91
00:04:11,803 --> 00:04:22,135
right there. Thank you, Sam. And thank you, Loot
Crate, for your fantastic sponsorship.

92
00:04:22,135 --> 00:04:24,793
LIAM: I feel like we just passed into performance
art, there.

93
00:04:24,793 --> 00:04:25,845
MATT: Yeah.

94
00:04:25,845 --> 00:04:31,959
SAM: Don't forget to use the code 'criticalrole'
for 10% off your Loot Crate monthly geek crate.

95
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:34,715
TRAVIS: That entire tooth is brown.

96
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:35,883
LAURA: I'm just going to throw up.

97
00:04:35,883 --> 00:04:38,493
TRAVIS: Your teeth are all brown!

98
00:04:38,493 --> 00:04:39,326
LAURA: It's so gross.

99
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:42,320
MATT: I feel like that's an opening act to Gaga's
next tour.

100
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,875
LIAM: Listen, real art makes you uncomfortable and
challenges you.

101
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:49,395
TRAVIS: The Super Bowl was missing that.

102
00:04:49,395 --> 00:04:51,247
MATT: Consider us challenged and uncomfortable.

103
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:53,382
MARISHA: That made my eyes water and not in a good
way.

104
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,683
TRAVIS: There's a part of the back of my head
that's cramped.

105
00:04:55,683 --> 00:04:56,732
MATT: Thank you Sam.

106
00:04:56,732 --> 00:04:58,481
TALIESIN: I'm no longer thinking about the game.
Well done. Yeah,

107
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:00,523
not even thinking a little bit about the game.

108
00:05:00,523 --> 00:05:02,225
MATT: All right.

109
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:04,130
SAM: I'll take care of this.

110
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,499
TALIESIN: Just roll it up and burn it.

111
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:06,858
MARISHA: Do you wanna handle that?

112
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:07,942
TALIESIN: You gonna finish that Coke?

113
00:05:07,942 --> 00:05:11,583
SAM: Oh, yeah.

114
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:15,073
MATT: It's the only way to be sure. All right, so
last week we mentioned this, I wanna tell you guys

115
00:05:15,073 --> 00:05:19,281

123
00:05:48,237 --> 00:05:48,906
TRAVIS: Yes!

124
00:05:48,906 --> 00:05:49,758
MATT: Check it out.

125
00:05:49,758 --> 00:05:50,932
TRAVIS: Take over the world!

126
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:56,090
MATT: Next up. Merch. Laura, do we have any
updates on that?

127
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,073
LAURA: (muffled) Aw man, I put food in my mouth!

128
00:05:58,073 --> 00:05:59,322
TRAVIS: What the fuck are you thinking? What're
you thinking?

129
00:05:59,322 --> 00:06:01,934
MATT: Quick, drink the Coke! Ten, nine, eight,
seven--

130
00:06:01,934 --> 00:06:05,195
MARISHA: I have one while she swallows.

131
00:06:05,195 --> 00:06:06,321
SAM: (belches)

132
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:09,038
MATT: Oh, god!

133
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:11,051
TRAVIS: The distance on that was incredible.

134
00:06:11,051 --> 00:06:12,565
MATT: My hair went (whoosh).

135
00:06:12,565 --> 00:06:14,577
LIAM: Hold on, Marisha. Are you okay?

136
00:06:14,577 --> 00:06:15,463
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm concerned.

137
00:06:15,463 --> 00:06:16,643
LIAM: Are you okay?

138
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:17,574
SAM: I'm fine.

139
00:06:17,574 --> 00:06:18,633
TALIESIN: Why are we not talking about this?

140
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:22,085
MARISHA: That sounded like something that happens
when you're diseased.

141
00:06:22,085 --> 00:06:24,484
TRAVIS: Yeah, I could feel your glycogen spike
from over here.

142
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:28,238
MATT: Marisha, you were saying?

143
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:36,419
MARISHA: This Saturday, it's the two-year
anniversary of the twitch stream.

144
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,158
(all cheer)

145
00:06:38,158 --> 00:06:39,774
TALIESIN: My, how time flies.

146
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:45,330
MARISHA: Yes, isn't that nice? And pleasant? And
not disgusting-looking? It's a 24-hour twitch

147
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:51,789
stream. There's gonna be a lot going on. There's
gonna be Gather Your Party, AXYB special, there's

148
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:54,705
gonna be Game the Game, and we're going to--

149
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,185
TALIESIN: Breaded Men?

150
00:06:56,185 --> 00:06:57,655
MARISHA: Bearded Men, not Breaded Men.

151
00:06:57,655 --> 00:06:59,240
TALIESIN: Oh, I saw Breaded Men, I was very
excited.

152
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:07,018
MARISHA: No, Bearded Men. And we are going to be
playing Mansions of Madness, some of us, here.

153
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:09,715
Like around one o'clock.

154
00:07:09,715 --> 00:07:13,526
MATT: And the charity stream is benefiting 826LA.

155
00:07:13,526 --> 00:07:18,469
MARISHA: Yeah. Yes. And the whole thing is gonna
be charity-related, it's all gonna go to 826LA.

156
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:19,749
MATT: Our friends there since the beginning.

157
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:20,797
MARISHA: Yeah.

158
00:07:20,797 --> 00:07:22,528
MATT: So looking forward to that.

159
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:26,317
MARISHA: Yeah, so donate, we're gonna be taking
donations, it's gonna be great.

160
00:07:26,317 --> 00:07:31,822
MATT: Exactly. And tomorrow at noon Pacific Time,
me and Darren De Paul are gonna be guesting on

161
00:07:31,822 --> 00:07:38,612
Eric's TBD RPG, the Doctor Who RPG, from noon to
3PM tomorrow Pacific, and then--

162
00:07:38,612 --> 00:07:39,817
OFF-SCREEN: High noon?

163
00:07:39,817 --> 00:07:42,980
(all groan)

164
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,977
MATT: And.

165
00:07:43,977 --> 00:07:46,446
(all laugh)

166
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:47,839
LIAM: Put him in the game so you can kill him.

167
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,000
MATT: Okay, that's a good call. And it looks like
we'll also be continuing that game on Saturday

168
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,927
before the Mansions of Madness stream, from 11-1.
So I'll be here for five hours. Again. On

169
00:07:57,927 --> 00:08:03,428
Saturday. But it's gonna be a lot of fun, looking
forward to it, I'm excited to go guest on there

170
00:08:03,428 --> 00:08:07,740
and play for a little bit, so hopefully see you
guys tomorrow and Saturday.

171
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,248
Let's see. Laura, now that you're--

172
00:08:09,248 --> 00:08:10,204
LAURA: Oh, hey!

173
00:08:10,204 --> 00:08:11,180
MATT: Hi.

174
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,092
LAURA: How's it going, guys?

175
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:12,939
MATT: Good, how're you doing?

176
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:20,269
LAURA: We have a-- don't you touch my donuts. We
have all of the normal, wonderful stuff still

177
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:24,622
available in the store. The stuff that's out of
stock, actually, has been removed so that you

178
00:08:24,622 --> 00:08:30,108
don't get confused when you're looking for things.
So we have our Gilmore shirt, we got our Strongjaw

179
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:37,675
shirt, we got a 'How do you want to do this'
shirt, with the hoodie. We got baseball caps, we

180
00:08:37,675 --> 00:08:43,839
got patches, we got vinyl stickers, which I am
still a really big fan of. They go on windshields,

181
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,912
Macbooks, whatever you want.

182
00:08:45,912 --> 00:08:46,801
TRAVIS: Pets.

183
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:48,550
LAURA: Pets! Not recommended.

184
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,624
TRAVIS: Really?

185
00:08:49,624 --> 00:08:54,256
LAURA: So yeah, check it out if you wanna wear
your Critical Role goodies.

186
00:08:54,256 --> 00:08:56,598
LIAM: You're like an Italian grandmother in
Hoboken, New Jersey right now.

187
00:08:56,598 --> 00:08:57,514
LAURA: Ey!

188
00:08:57,514 --> 00:08:59,846
TRAVIS: Bada-bing!

189
00:08:59,846 --> 00:09:01,463
LAURA: Bada-bing, bada-boom, there you go.

190
00:09:01,463 --> 00:09:05,440
MATT: Moving on. The new Signal Boost came out,
with Jason Charles Miller as the host, our friend

191
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,901
who played Garthok for his temporary run during
the initial Conclave attack.

192
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:11,230
TRAVIS: He is part of the Clasp.

193
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,386
MATT: Yes. And he is--

194
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:13,568
MARISHA: And he did our theme music.

195
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:17,540
MATT: He did our theme music for the show, here,
he's a very talented musician. And a good friend

196
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:25,362
of the show. And you can see his new run on Signal
Boost this week. New GM Tips is out today. My

197
00:09:25,362 --> 00:09:29,675
second-to-last on the run at this time. This
episode is more for the players, and deals with

198
00:09:29,675 --> 00:09:33,705
creating and running characters that are against
the normal tropes and the type that people

199
00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:37,750
generally fall into when creating a new character
in an RPG. So go check it out,

200
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,042
see if any of it seems to resonate.

201
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:45,923
TALIESIN: This is how he criticizes us now, is he
makes a little web video and sends it to all of us

202
00:09:45,923 --> 00:09:47,555
instead of talking to us.

203
00:09:47,555 --> 00:09:48,869
MARISHA: Yeah, it's very passive aggressive.

204
00:09:48,869 --> 00:09:53,087
MATT: Took you a while to figure it out, Taliesin.
But I'm glad you finally did.

205
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:55,167
TALIESIN: I'm feeling it.

206
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:57,444
MATT: Also, Wednesday Club, Taliesin?

207
00:09:57,444 --> 00:10:02,660
TALIESIN: Yes, it turns out I have to record voice
over on occasion, so Wednesday Club is not going

208
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:08,585
to be me this week and I'll be talking to comic
books to the engineer who will be mildly irritated

209
00:10:08,585 --> 00:10:14,618
with me. But instead, you guys, Matt Key is going
to be hosting and he is going to talk about

210
00:10:14,618 --> 00:10:16,647
his favorite thing in the world.

211
00:10:16,706 --> 00:10:17,611
MATT: Doctor Strange.

212
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:18,308
MARISHA: Doctor Strange.

213
00:10:18,308 --> 00:10:19,776
TALIESIN: -- his wife, and Doctor Strange, but
that's cool, too. Because him and his wife.

214
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:21,067
MARISHA: Oh yeah, oh yeah, and his wife. And
Doctor Strange.

215
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:22,502
TALIESIN: And Doctor Strange, his work wife.

216
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:23,446
MARISHA: Yeah.

217
00:10:23,446 --> 00:10:25,211
TALIESIN: It's great and fun.

218
00:10:25,211 --> 00:10:27,681
MATT: Also, don't forget we have Talks Machina
live on Tuesday nights.

219
00:10:27,681 --> 00:10:28,830
(all cheer)

220
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:35,221
MATT: 7PM here on Twitch and Alpha, hosted by our
fantastic Brian Foster. So check us out next week

221
00:10:35,221 --> 00:10:40,360
to discuss this episode when it comes up. Last two
things: one, we mentioned it on Talks Machina, but

222
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,506
one of our fantastic crew members, Amandine, who's
currently trying to legally find a way to stay in

223
00:10:45,506 --> 00:10:51,704
this country, currently put up a Fundly, the fun
folks here, part of the cast and community put

224
00:10:51,704 --> 00:11:00,912
together a Fundly, fundly.com/we-love-amandine/ to
raise money to help with her legal costs and try

225
00:11:00,912 --> 00:11:06,481
keep her here and working with us. The community
has already been incredible. If you have any

226
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:10,025
interest in help and support that, I recommend go
check it out and give what little that you can

227
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:19,149
because it all helps. And last but not least we
got a gift today in the mail from a fantastic

228
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:29,183
critter named Chris Capola who as part of an
anniversary present for me and Marisha built a

229
00:11:29,242 --> 00:11:36,616
treasure chest. Like from scratch, like cut down
the tree, trimmed, lathed...

230
00:11:36,616 --> 00:11:39,118
built a treasure chest.

231
00:11:39,289 --> 00:11:40,581
LAURA: It's amazing.

232
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:41,984
TRAVIS: That's man-made wood right there.

233
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:45,740
LAURA: We thought it was for all of us but then we
realized it was just for Matt and Marisha.

234
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,631
LIAM: It's physically beautiful but just the
process we saw outlined is--

235
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:52,236
LAURA: Phenomenal.

236
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,856
LIAM: Beautiful, beautiful gift.

237
00:11:53,856 --> 00:11:58,160
MATT: So Chris, thank you, tremendously, from all
of us, but mostly me and Marisha.

238
00:11:58,216 --> 00:12:01,724
(all laugh)

239
00:12:01,724 --> 00:12:04,650
LIAM: I'm going to take a dump in that box, at
your house, the first opportunity I get.

240
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,779
(all laugh)

241
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:07,575
LAURA: No!

242
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:16,505
MATT: That is absolutely brilliant, and undeserved
and very happy to find a very wonderful place in

243
00:12:16,585 --> 00:12:22,106
our home to fill it with awesome nerdy shit. Thank you
guys. All right, I think that's the end of our

244
00:12:22,253 --> 00:12:24,045
announcements. That being the case.

245
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:25,769
ALL: No, no, no, no!

246
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:26,480
MATT: Let's jump in--

247
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,159
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

248
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,174
MATT: -- to tonight's episode--

249
00:12:28,174 --> 00:12:29,115
ALL: No, no, no, no!

250
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,175
MATT: -- of Critical Role.

251
00:12:30,175 --> 00:12:31,393
(all cheer)

252
00:12:31,393 --> 00:14:02,812
[opening credits]

253
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:10,576
MATT: And welcome back. So, picking up where we
left off this last episode, Vox Machina had

254
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:16,557
made their way west into the Ozmit Sea, to the
islands of Anamn and to the city of Vesrah, the

255
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:23,078
final stop in Keyleth's long-running Aramente. To
prove herself leader of her people of Zephra. Here

256
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:28,957
they were given a task, as part of the Aramente,
where they had to retrieve three lodestones within the

257
00:14:28,957 --> 00:14:35,138
rift of the water elemental plane, which as of
late had been taken up residence by a kraken, an

258
00:14:35,185 --> 00:14:43,606
ancient pet of the Titans, now freed and left to
wander, to feed, grow, and apparently loom across

259
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:53,833
that boundary. The party went in and, due to an
unfortunate vomiting episode underwater, drew the

260
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,760
attention of the kraken.

261
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,407
LAURA: Did you plan that?

262
00:14:58,407 --> 00:14:59,365
SAM: What?

263
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,049
LAURA: That you were almost vomiting today, and
you vomited and ruined our lives?

264
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:06,754
SAM: I just plan to vomit every week. At least
once.

265
00:15:06,754 --> 00:15:11,041
MATT: It's for the best, I think. However, drew
the attention of the kraken, and a very, very

266
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:17,974
intense battle ensued, in which most of you
managed to escape by the skin of your teeth,

267
00:15:17,974 --> 00:15:27,231
however, in the battle, Vax did fall, his body
left cold and lifeless beneath the waters. In a

268
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:32,890
last-minute urge of leadership, Keyleth reached
out, grabbed the twins, and Planeshifted back into

269
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:42,444
the prime material plane, with Percival, Taryon,
and Grog looking to escape. You managed to be

270
00:15:42,444 --> 00:15:47,037
vomited up with, apparently, almost no hit points
left, and jumped through the portal while flicking

271
00:15:47,037 --> 00:15:49,034
off the kraken as--

272
00:15:49,034 --> 00:15:49,904
TRAVIS: Double-birds.

273
00:15:49,904 --> 00:15:50,688
LIAM: Badass.

274
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:55,424
MATT: And that was where we left off. So. Before
we get into this--

275
00:15:55,424 --> 00:15:59,688
SAM: Wait, what? There's a before?

276
00:15:59,688 --> 00:16:00,560
MATT: Vax.

277
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,515
MARISHA: Oh, no.

278
00:16:01,515 --> 00:16:02,764
LAURA: You!

279
00:16:02,764 --> 00:16:04,273
SAM: Bastard.

280
00:16:04,273 --> 00:16:11,888
MATT: As you feel the cold waters rush around you,
and your vision go dark, even as the

281
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:20,500
unconsciousness takes you, your vision narrows and
tunnels until it's just nothing. And while you

282
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:29,588
were floating before, the cold temperature begins
to become warm. It's a familiar warmth. And as

283
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:34,006
opposed to being in water, there is no resistance,
you are just in a dark space. You can look down,

284
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:40,402
and you can now see your hands. And you recall,
and you remember this. You've been here before.

285
00:16:40,402 --> 00:16:48,259
This is very reminiscent of your first journey
into the blood pool, your first true communion

286
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:53,458
with the Raven Queen. And the moment you make that
realization, as you're looking at your hands, you

287
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:57,777
watch as something dull and white arises from the
darkness below you, and you look down and see the

288
00:16:57,777 --> 00:17:04,951
massive porcelain mask of the Raven Queen emerge
from the shadows, tendrils of darkness spilling

289
00:17:04,951 --> 00:17:14,355
off the edges and the corners. As you watch the
stone face of the Raven Queen rise up to meet

290
00:17:14,355 --> 00:17:21,160
yours, what seemed immense suddenly seems small.
And as the shadow pulls away, you can see the

291
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:27,367
tumbles of jet-black hair falling past the
shoulders, the long, raven-feather-woven--

292
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:30,702
[no audio]

293
00:17:30,702 --> 00:17:37,249
MATT: -- gathers and then vanishes into the
impossible darkness behind her. The hands reach

294
00:17:37,249 --> 00:17:43,760
out and take you by the sides of the head, and you
hear the voice once again emanating, sourceless,

295
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:55,651
ringing from all around you. It says, "My
champion. It seems you've stepped to return to me.

296
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,505
"But what is your destined thread to be?"

297
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:03,998
Grog, as you come jumping through 
the portal and turn to

298
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:08,687
flick off the kraken, you watch as one of its
tendrils begins to-- one of its final tentacles

299
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:12,136
that's still there pulls through and begins to try
and grab one of the sides of

300
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:15,451
the rock lodestone pillars.

301
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:16,505
TRAVIS: Oh no!

302
00:18:16,505 --> 00:18:20,809
MATT: The other guardians, half merfolk, half
various individuals, rush forward and begin

303
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:27,530
stabbing at it, as it begins to get its beak
snapping right at the interior of this portal. You

304
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:31,970
see it starting to flex and the energy beginning
to pulse, it's almost trying and force its way

305
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:37,144
through a much smaller opening. Percival, Grog,
Taryon, what are you guys doing?

306
00:18:37,144 --> 00:18:38,997
SAM: Oh, shit. We have to do stuff?

307
00:18:38,997 --> 00:18:40,249
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

308
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:43,849
TALIESIN: I'm still underwater, aren't I?

309
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:45,852
MATT: You all are still underwater, yes.

310
00:18:45,852 --> 00:18:49,017
TRAVIS: Does this happen a lot?

311
00:18:49,017 --> 00:18:52,654
MATT: The guardians right now are just shouting
and screaming and stabbing at the tentacle.

312
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:55,588
TRAVIS: (yells) A lot of that? There's a lot of
just open-mouthed (yells)?

313
00:18:55,588 --> 00:18:59,803
MATT: Yeah, the guard's like, "Argh! Quick! Push
it back!" They're all stabbing it. The one

314
00:18:59,803 --> 00:19:02,812
tentacle finally snaps and withdraws inside.

315
00:19:02,812 --> 00:19:05,713
TRAVIS: We could just go, we could just leave,
it's just fine. It's good.

316
00:19:05,713 --> 00:19:09,786
MATT: The mouth pulls back, and now the whole body
shifts over, and you see the one giant eye from

317
00:19:09,786 --> 00:19:11,274
one side of the kraken come peering through--

318
00:19:11,274 --> 00:19:12,573
TRAVIS: Yeah, fuck that noise.

319
00:19:12,573 --> 00:19:18,628
TALIESIN: I am dragging Taryon-- and you, if I can
drag you as well-- we're walking away.

320
00:19:18,628 --> 00:19:23,949
TRAVIS: The eyeball's soft, let me throw one more
time at the eyeball. Yeah, I throw the hammer at

321
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:24,998
the eyeball.

322
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,486
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make an attack.

323
00:19:26,486 --> 00:19:28,148
TRAVIS: Okay. Reckless!

324
00:19:28,148 --> 00:19:31,627
MATT: Reckless. Okay, so you had disadvantage
underwater, so it's just one roll.

325
00:19:31,627 --> 00:19:34,834
TRAVIS: Ah, balls. 23.

326
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:35,841
MATT: That'll hit.

327
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,963
TRAVIS: Nice!

328
00:19:36,963 --> 00:19:40,057
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

329
00:19:40,057 --> 00:19:42,148
TRAVIS: I meant two-handed. Oh no, I'm throwing
it.

330
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:43,434
MATT: You're throwing it.

331
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:45,704
(music flares up)

332
00:19:45,704 --> 00:19:47,742
LAURA: There it is.

333
00:19:47,742 --> 00:19:49,089
MATT: This connector's a little wonky.

334
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:53,840
TRAVIS: 21 points of damage. I'm still enlarged,
right?

335
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,169
MATT: You are, yes.

336
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:58,202
TRAVIS: 25 points of damage.

337
00:19:58,202 --> 00:20:04,484
MATT: 25. Whack! As you release the hammer, it
goes Thor-style just head-first, piercing through

338
00:20:04,484 --> 00:20:09,908
the water, and (impact sound) into the open eye of
the kraken as it slams shut. You hear the (groan)

339
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:15,669
as it reels back and the voice pierces through the
rift towards you and most of the people in the

340
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:23,597
vicinity one more time, saying, "I'm coming soon
enough." And as it pulls back, the remainder of

341
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:27,047
the guardians go ahead and reach over, each
putting hands on the lodestones, and shift them

342
00:20:27,047 --> 00:20:32,038
slightly in place, and you watch as the rift
crackles and then doesn't slam entirely shut, but

343
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:36,816
the image you had of the water elemental plane
suddenly grows a little more opaque and difficult

344
00:20:36,873 --> 00:20:38,473
to make out the discerning details.

345
00:20:38,473 --> 00:20:40,301
TRAVIS: Did I manage to (thump sound)?

346
00:20:40,301 --> 00:20:41,245
MATT: Yeah, your hammer does return.

347
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:47,987
TRAVIS: Oh, thank god. Well, we all give something
every once in awhile.

348
00:20:47,987 --> 00:20:53,959
MATT: So, as you're carrying the-- which you
were--

349
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:55,563
SAM: He resuscitated me, I believe?

350
00:20:55,563 --> 00:20:56,262
MATT: Yes.

351
00:20:56,262 --> 00:20:57,137
SAM: I have six points.

352
00:20:57,137 --> 00:21:02,892
MATT: Yes. So, conscious, horribly beaten. It
seems that the kraken has been beaten back, and

353
00:21:02,892 --> 00:21:07,356
currently the lode-stones are utilized to keep the
rift in check. You're uncertain as to whether or

354
00:21:07,356 --> 00:21:12,261
not the threat of the kraken was an idle threat or
whatever else it has planned, but regardless,

355
00:21:12,261 --> 00:21:13,409
that's the least of your worries.

356
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:14,582
TALIESIN: Did we all hear it?

357
00:21:14,582 --> 00:21:16,004
SAM: Hear what?

358
00:21:16,004 --> 00:21:17,143
TALIESIN: The kraken.

359
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:18,498
TRAVIS: 'Cause he mind-speaks, right?

360
00:21:18,498 --> 00:21:19,320
MATT: It would've been--

361
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,251
TRAVIS: It brain-talks.

362
00:21:20,251 --> 00:21:22,251
MATT: It would've been primarily to you, Grog, and
some of the other guardians nearby.

363
00:21:22,251 --> 00:21:23,606
TALIESIN: Okay. That's good.

364
00:21:23,606 --> 00:21:30,608
TRAVIS: Well, he was not happy in the end, there.
But he recognized true power

365
00:21:30,608 --> 00:21:35,424
and he was sorry to see us go.

366
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:43,979
MATT: As soon as you've had this conversation, you
turn and look to the left and you see Durent there

367
00:21:43,979 --> 00:21:50,055
who is waiting and goes, "Where is the rest of
them? Where's the rest? Where's Keyleth?"

368
00:21:50,055 --> 00:21:55,359
TALIESIN: They-- they--

369
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:57,001
TRAVIS: They distappeared.

370
00:21:57,001 --> 00:21:58,068
TALIESIN: They went away.

371
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:00,314
LAURA: (laughs) Distappeared.

372
00:22:00,314 --> 00:22:04,924
MATT: "Well, let's hope that they know where
they're going, at the very least.

373
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:07,350
"Any idea where they went?"

374
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,449
TALIESIN: Can we breathe some air? Please?

375
00:22:10,449 --> 00:22:17,730
MATT: "Aye, aye, all right, follow me, follow me."
And he starts leading the swimming cavalcade of

376
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:22,495
individuals that are leading you up to the top of
Vesrah. Back up through the Aerie of Torrent,

377
00:22:22,495 --> 00:22:29,467
through the various tubes and tunnels of the reef
that leads towards the surface of the Ozmit Sea.

378
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:38,921
Simultaneously, Keyleth, Vex, and the lifeless
body of Vax, you apparate roughly ten feet above

379
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:44,063
the surface of the water on the outskirts of
Vesrah. Tumble a bit, and splash into the

380
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:51,663
foot-and-a-half shallow waters on the outskirts.
As you all get up for a minute and think about

381
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:59,465
your circumstance. Vex, you look down and you see
your brother, face-down in the water, floating.

382
00:22:59,465 --> 00:23:04,374
LAURA: I flip him over and look at him. Vax! Vax,
wake up!

383
00:23:04,374 --> 00:23:07,347
MARISHA: Come on. Come on. We have to get him out
of this environment. Come on.

384
00:23:07,347 --> 00:23:08,646
LAURA: Is there a cleric on the island?

385
00:23:08,646 --> 00:23:14,960
MARISHA: Yes. Before I do anything, I am going to
throw up a Sky Write above the city.

386
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,797
LAURA: I start dragging his body.

387
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:26,612
MARISHA: And it says, "Help. Cleric." That works.
They'll get the idea. Hold on to him. Get on. I am

388
00:23:26,612 --> 00:23:32,853
going to turn into my giant raven form again.

389
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:34,245
LAURA: How big is that?

390
00:23:34,245 --> 00:23:37,534
MARISHA: It's like the giant eagle form. I just
kind of modify it for style.

391
00:23:37,534 --> 00:23:38,465
LAURA: That's tight.

392
00:23:38,465 --> 00:23:43,128
MATT: Okay, so using the stats of a giant eagle
but you're going into a raven-type form.

393
00:23:43,128 --> 00:23:44,241
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

394
00:23:44,241 --> 00:23:45,263
MATT: Okay.

395
00:23:45,263 --> 00:23:46,189
MARISHA: Black feathers.

396
00:23:46,189 --> 00:23:46,957
TRAVIS: Good.

397
00:23:46,957 --> 00:23:48,013
MARISHA: All that coolness. Yeah.

398
00:23:48,013 --> 00:23:48,858
TRAVIS: It's all about branding.

399
00:23:48,858 --> 00:23:49,879
MARISHA: Yeah. A hundred percent.

400
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:50,728
TRAVIS: Yep.

401
00:23:50,728 --> 00:23:52,566
MATT: Okay. And what're you doing?

402
00:23:52,566 --> 00:23:53,448
MARISHA: Gotta be on-message.

403
00:23:53,448 --> 00:23:56,345
LAURA: Where are we going?

404
00:23:56,345 --> 00:24:01,104
MARISHA: I fly off towards the center of the city,
towards where the entrance of the portal was,

405
00:24:01,104 --> 00:24:04,534
'cause I'm assuming there would be sages and
clerics waiting there.

406
00:24:04,534 --> 00:24:06,150
MATT: Well, the portal is beneath the city.

407
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,610
MARISHA: I know but there is like a--

408
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:12,347
MATT: There is the central chamber in the middle
of the city, which is where it seemed the base of

409
00:24:12,347 --> 00:24:19,402
where the social gatherings seemed to occur. And
the centerpiece was where Uvenda and many of the

410
00:24:19,402 --> 00:24:22,622
other keepers of the city seemed to frequent.

411
00:24:22,622 --> 00:24:23,585
MARISHA: I'll head there.

412
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:27,147
MATT: Okay. So you watch as the giant raven takes
off.

413
00:24:27,147 --> 00:24:28,832
LAURA: Oh no, I'm holding onto her, right?

414
00:24:28,832 --> 00:24:29,672
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

415
00:24:29,672 --> 00:24:30,463
MATT: Okay, so you're holding onto her.

416
00:24:30,463 --> 00:24:32,571
MARISHA: She's holding onto him and we're riding
there.

417
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:35,661
MATT: Okay, I see. I got you. Okay so you climb
onto the back of the giant raven, clutching your

418
00:24:35,661 --> 00:24:43,806
brother in one arm, and as the wings pick up, you
use all the might that you have to just hold on.

419
00:24:43,806 --> 00:24:48,631
You're used to flying under your own power
usually, not somebody else's. But as the wings

420
00:24:48,631 --> 00:24:55,391
take off, the sea breeze, thankfully, is not too
heavy that day. And as you coast in, coming down,

421
00:24:55,391 --> 00:25:01,198
dodging between the various buildings heading
towards the central risen chamber. You watch as

422
00:25:01,198 --> 00:25:08,773
the upper, third-tier level of this, there's a
single chamber that is open and the outside wall

423
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:12,719
is a series of pillars that makes up the
structure. On the inside, you can see it dips down

424
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:19,705
into three different sunken platforms, and in the
center there are a handful of small statues,

425
00:25:19,705 --> 00:25:27,361
there's incense being burned, and what looks to be
a small altar of some kind. There are four figures

426
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:34,397
there inside, all dressed in similar blues and
greens, aquas and whites, most of them are just

427
00:25:34,397 --> 00:25:42,666
long robes with dangling shell-based jewelry, and
various smoothed-off stones that have been found

428
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:49,045
tossed and rounded by the elements through the
years. And in the center of the chamber, in the

429
00:25:49,045 --> 00:25:54,545
process of lighting a few of these, you're not
quite sure of the material, but they appear to be

430
00:25:54,545 --> 00:26:00,499
candles, as you see they're being lit like
candles. You see Uvenda is walking with her staff,

431
00:26:00,499 --> 00:26:07,734
taking this long burning tube, and is currently
setting them alight as you approach. As the wings

432
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:13,510
of the raven begin to prepare for landing, the
wind kicks up in front and you see some of the

433
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:18,196
other guardians put their arm up and look up
curiously. Some of them reaching back and

434
00:26:18,196 --> 00:26:23,671
preparing for whatever may be there. Uvenda's
voice however rings out across the center of this

435
00:26:23,671 --> 00:26:30,869
chamber and says, "Stop! Stop. I know this one who
approaches." And as they all slowly back up,

436
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:38,817
Uvenda stumbles upward, sets aside her small
hand-based wick to one of the servants and

437
00:26:38,817 --> 00:26:44,017
approaches the raven as you begin to slink off the
side of the bird.

438
00:26:44,017 --> 00:26:47,720
LAURA: Please! Are there any clerics here?

439
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:55,007
MATT: "We do have some here of a healing-based
nature. Yes. Has he been hurt?"

440
00:26:55,007 --> 00:26:59,406
LAURA: He's-- He's dead.

441
00:26:59,406 --> 00:27:05,672
MATT: She slowly approaches and reaches over and
puts her hand on the forehead of Vax's corpse.

442
00:27:05,672 --> 00:27:15,508
Runs her thumb along the cold skin. "Indeed. The
kraken claims another."

443
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:21,817
LAURA: No. No, he won't claim him. What can we
do?

444
00:27:24,967 --> 00:27:32,342
MATT: "The power that is at our disposal could
perhaps bring him back, though his form may be

445
00:27:32,497 --> 00:27:34,950
"different than you recall."

446
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,641
MARISHA: I drop my form.

447
00:27:37,641 --> 00:27:44,303
MATT: All right. The feathers scatter off as
Keyleth is now returned to her half-elf image.

448
00:27:44,303 --> 00:27:53,461
MARISHA: Do you have means of traveling quickly?
We have a friend who is a cleric. Can you get us

449
00:27:53,608 --> 00:28:01,327
to her there and back quickly? Or someone who can
Tree Stride me there and bring her back? I'm

450
00:28:01,327 --> 00:28:10,413
exhausted or else I would do it myself. Please?
Please?

451
00:28:10,413 --> 00:28:17,537
MATT: "I have not a means of travel, but we could
reach out to someone."

452
00:28:17,537 --> 00:28:19,586
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. Any--

453
00:28:19,586 --> 00:28:22,386
MATT: "All right." And she walks back to the
altar, and you can see where there are a series of

454
00:28:22,386 --> 00:28:26,666
these statues. There's four of them in the center
and there's one large statue in the center. And

455
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:34,430
the center statue, it looks almost like 
long-petrified reef. It's white, it's porous, it looks

456
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:41,828
like the long-dead reef. But it seems to swirl
into a tree-like shape. It's this weird merging of

457
00:28:41,828 --> 00:28:47,568
sea and forest-based imagery, and as each various
portion of the tree outstretches, you see various

458
00:28:47,568 --> 00:28:55,940
baubles are hanging from it. You see stones,
necklaces, notes. Uvenda sets her staff to the

459
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:04,124
side and her small, slightly arched form begins to
slowly crawl up the side of the tree, and it looks

460
00:29:04,124 --> 00:29:08,369
a bit physically arduous for her but nobody offers
to help. You see that this is something that she's

461
00:29:08,369 --> 00:29:12,396
done often and is part of her job as the guardian
here in Vesrah.

462
00:29:12,396 --> 00:29:18,870
MARISHA: While she does this, I come over the
earpiece and I say, Grog, Percy, quick, get back up

463
00:29:18,917 --> 00:29:20,852
to the central tower. Quick.

464
00:29:20,852 --> 00:29:23,964
LAURA: How do we even know they're alive?

465
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:26,827
MARISHA: I am trusting that they are.

466
00:29:26,827 --> 00:29:30,180
MATT: With the distance of the earpiece, you can
hear them. Yes.

467
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,890
TALIESIN: We're on our way.

468
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:35,797
MARISHA: Oh thank god. Thank god. Is everyone
still alive down there?

469
00:29:35,797 --> 00:29:38,454
TALIESIN: Barely. Yes, for the moment.

470
00:29:38,454 --> 00:29:44,597
MARISHA: Vax is down. So hurry.

471
00:29:44,597 --> 00:29:48,255
TALIESIN: We're on our way.

472
00:29:48,255 --> 00:29:53,748
MATT: As you're finishing the statement, you watch
as Uvenda is climbing down with one hand and has

473
00:29:53,748 --> 00:29:59,763
something cradled in her left arm as she's like
(grunts), almost slips for a minute and sets

474
00:29:59,763 --> 00:30:06,905
herself down back on both her feet and rubs her
lower back. "You'll get there one day."

475
00:30:06,951 --> 00:30:09,474
LAURA: Please hurry.

476
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,701
MATT: And she unfurls her arm, and you can see
there's a conch shell. A small conch shell, but a

477
00:30:12,701 --> 00:30:15,751
conch shell. And she goes,

478
00:30:15,751 --> 00:30:21,233
"Whoever you're wishing to speak to, think of 
them and whisper it into the shell."

479
00:30:25,463 --> 00:30:33,728
MARISHA: Pike. Pike, if you can hear me, we need
you, now, in Vesrah. Please, it's Vax.

480
00:30:37,358 --> 00:30:38,700
LAURA: How do we know if it worked?

481
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,441
MARISHA: Yeah? I second that statement.

482
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:51,896
MATT: "She'll hear you. It's up to her whether or
not she can act." And she hands the conch over to

483
00:30:51,896 --> 00:31:00,945
one of the assistants, takes her staff back up.
"Now, we offer the service still, should you not

484
00:31:00,945 --> 00:31:08,545
"hear anything. We are more than willing to try and
restore him to whatever form we can."

485
00:31:08,545 --> 00:31:15,523
LAURA: How much time does-- How long is too long?

486
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:20,938
MARISHA: I don't want to wait too long. Let's just
wait a little while longer and see if we hear

487
00:31:20,938 --> 00:31:29,409
anything from Pike. She's very smart. She'll hear
us.

488
00:31:30,579 --> 00:31:33,261
LAURA: I start brushing his hair off of his face.

489
00:31:33,261 --> 00:31:37,177
MARISHA: While she does that, I start gathering
the feathers and start laying them out as a bed

490
00:31:37,177 --> 00:31:40,285
around Vax, and preparing the station.

491
00:31:40,285 --> 00:31:45,183
MATT: Okay, so the scattered remnants of your
transformation, the raven feathers that were

492
00:31:45,183 --> 00:31:51,744
shunted from your form, you begin to form into a
bed-like place to set his body on. Okay. While you

493
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:57,247
guys are doing that, Durent finally breaks the
surface of the water, where you were originally

494
00:31:57,247 --> 00:32:03,035
brought down into the Aerie of Torrent. And after
you've all hit the surface and breathed out, the

495
00:32:03,035 --> 00:32:11,073
bright midday sun is coming down, the smell of sea
air hits you. You hear the distant cawing of

496
00:32:11,073 --> 00:32:16,773
various ocean shore birds. It's a welcome change
of pace from the murky depths of the water

497
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:24,517
elemental plane you've been facing for the past
few moments. As soon as you emerge, Durent steps

498
00:32:24,517 --> 00:32:32,404
up onto the sand, turns around, shakes and brushes
his hair off. "All right. Well, that's the end of

499
00:32:32,404 --> 00:32:35,129
"my watch. I don't know what to do."

500
00:32:35,129 --> 00:32:39,338
TRAVIS: Could you point us in the direction of
where your healers would be?

501
00:32:39,338 --> 00:32:45,280
MATT: "Healers?" And he points over to the large
ascending central structure in Vesrah. The one

502
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:50,936
above where you guys had dinner the night before.
"That's your best bet there. That's where Uvenda

503
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:53,695
"is, at least. She can help you more than I do. I
spend most of my time on the outskirts,

504
00:32:53,695 --> 00:32:57,318
"or down below."

505
00:32:57,318 --> 00:33:01,117
TRAVIS: Right. Thank you for watching our backs in
there, that was real hairy, but we have to be

506
00:33:01,117 --> 00:33:03,018
leaving you now.

507
00:33:03,018 --> 00:33:04,170
MATT: "Oh, understood."

508
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:06,134
TRAVIS: Yeah.

509
00:33:06,134 --> 00:33:11,376
MATT: "Hope everything's okay." And he gives you a
nod and steps over to the side and watches as you

510
00:33:11,376 --> 00:33:23,106
guys go, as he retrieves one of his Waverunner
sailing boards, and watches with a look of

511
00:33:23,106 --> 00:33:29,663
intensity and worry on his brow, as his dark
dwarven complexion vanishes in the distance. You

512
00:33:29,663 --> 00:33:34,702
guys approaching, rushing in towards the center of
the city. As you begin to approach, you watch as

513
00:33:34,702 --> 00:33:40,703
Doty, who's been waiting patiently off to the
side, comes up to you and is holding the book out,

514
00:33:40,703 --> 00:33:43,435
and starts thumbing through page after page after
page.

515
00:33:43,435 --> 00:33:49,848
SAM: Ah, yes, Doty, thank you. I'll review this
all later. How many pages did you fill?

516
00:33:49,848 --> 00:33:54,856
MATT: He goes past about 25 different pages, in
very very tiny script, that goes into detail about

517
00:33:54,856 --> 00:34:03,512
the tides going in, each person that went in and
out of the water, anything he saw in the further

518
00:34:03,512 --> 00:34:10,482
distance, various birds from the sky. He does have
a few spatterings of white bird excrement across

519
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:11,547
the top of his armor.

520
00:34:11,547 --> 00:34:14,558
SAM: Sure he does.

521
00:34:14,558 --> 00:34:17,564
MATT: He seems as proud as an automaton could.

522
00:34:17,564 --> 00:34:23,580
SAM: Very well done, Doty, thank you. We'll have
much more to write tonight, so save some energy

523
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:30,322
for that. Will you-- Will you carry me?

524
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:40,291
MATT: He sweeps you up in a full-on princess
carry, and begins running after Percival and Grog,

525
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:48,127
towards the center of Vesrah. You guys reach the
base of this. There are all the open stone

526
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:52,640
pavilions, the central gathering areas, where you
now see people starting to look up curiously,

527
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,578
coming out of their various homes and places,
noticing all this commotion happening on the top

528
00:34:56,578 --> 00:35:05,891
of the temple. You watch as there is a spattering
of dark feathers up the top. And you guys begin to

529
00:35:05,891 --> 00:35:11,292
ascend one of the two spiral staircases that
ascends to the upper level of the temple.

530
00:35:11,292 --> 00:35:15,046
Eventually you guys come to the surface, you're
immediately greeted by one of the guards who is on

531
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:19,298
guard currently with one of their spears. And upon
recognizing you, he kind of steps aside and lets

532
00:35:19,298 --> 00:35:26,008
you in, and that's where you guys watch as Keyleth
and Vex are laying Vax down onto a kind of

533
00:35:26,008 --> 00:35:28,443
makeshift bed of black feathers.

534
00:35:34,662 --> 00:35:36,902
SAM: What? Am I there?

535
00:35:36,902 --> 00:35:38,897
MATT: You're there. You're still in Doty's arms.

536
00:35:38,897 --> 00:35:49,024
SAM: Doty, down. What happened? What's going on?
Is he dead?

537
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:52,842
TRAVIS: Yeah. This is what happens when you
adventure.

538
00:35:52,842 --> 00:35:54,106
TALIESIN: Keyleth, what--

539
00:35:54,106 --> 00:35:55,791
SAM: Oh god.

540
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:59,230
MARISHA: She'll come. She'll come.

541
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,222
TRAVIS: Who?

542
00:36:00,222 --> 00:36:01,517
TALIESIN: Are there other options?

543
00:36:01,517 --> 00:36:03,135
MARISHA: I'm waiting for Pike. She'll come.

544
00:36:03,135 --> 00:36:04,563
TALIESIN: Are there other options?

545
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:05,616
MARISHA: Pike will come.

546
00:36:05,616 --> 00:36:07,287
LAURA: There are other options.

547
00:36:07,287 --> 00:36:10,103
MARISHA: But they're not good enough. Pike will
come.

548
00:36:10,103 --> 00:36:14,805
LAURA: I don't care what he looks like. I just
want him back.

549
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:21,266
MARISHA: Pike will come. I don't want to do this
without Pike. She'll come.

550
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:24,795
MATT: Uvenda at this point is starting to gather
some of the servants and they're starting to take

551
00:36:24,795 --> 00:36:32,813
down certain baubles and trinkets from the tree
branches and setting them in a vicinity around,

552
00:36:32,813 --> 00:36:39,282
and as she does so she's like, "These represent
protection of the waves." They take some small

553
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:42,584
salts and kind of scatter them around. They're
doing the best they can from a ceremonial

554
00:36:42,584 --> 00:36:53,974
standpoint to at least prepare a space. About 15
tense moments pass, as you all look out to the

555
00:36:53,974 --> 00:37:04,190
horizon, the sun now moving past its zenith and
pushing into the afternoon portion of the day. The

556
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:09,849
air is growing a little more hot. You find both
the nerves, the stress, and the temperature of the

557
00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:16,305
room, all the light from the sun being reflected
off the white stone, causing this kind of heated

558
00:37:16,305 --> 00:37:19,532
element of the interior and you instinctually
begin to sweat and it's getting slightly

559
00:37:19,532 --> 00:37:27,107
uncomfortable. There is what sounds like a distant
rumble of thunder.

560
00:37:32,804 --> 00:37:34,700
MARISHA: Where is it coming from?

561
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,136
MATT: You're not sure. It just sort of seemed
directionless.

562
00:37:38,136 --> 00:37:41,521
TALIESIN: Is anybody else startled by it?

563
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:45,760
MATT: You guys all notice each other reacting to
the sound and suddenly it happens again, but this

564
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,277
time much closer.

565
00:37:48,645 --> 00:37:50,936
MARISHA: Is this normal? What's happening?

566
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:59,499
MATT: Uvenda's looking a bit awkwardly in the--
"Normal? No. But let us be cautious." As she takes

567
00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:02,632
her staff, her little elderly gnomish form kind of
clutching it

568
00:38:02,632 --> 00:38:04,592
in front of her in a defensive standpoint.

569
00:38:04,592 --> 00:38:05,802
TRAVIS: Oh, great.

570
00:38:05,802 --> 00:38:07,186
LAURA: Don't let anything harm him.

571
00:38:07,186 --> 00:38:08,292
TRAVIS: Yeah.

572
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:12,085
TALIESIN: I'm going to run to my room and get my
things. Have we had-- we have not had anything

573
00:38:12,085 --> 00:38:14,516
vaguely resembling a short rest at this point.

574
00:38:14,516 --> 00:38:18,837
MATT: No. It all happened very rapidly. The rest
has been the 15 minutes of kind of waiting to hear

575
00:38:18,837 --> 00:38:24,604
if anything happened. As soon as you start darting
to leave, Percival, that rolling thunder sound

576
00:38:24,604 --> 00:38:30,437
hits with a small thunder crack. Right in the room
there's a flash of light, there's a spiral burst

577
00:38:30,437 --> 00:38:35,613
of what looks like a white-orange flame. And there
you see, dropped from about ten feet in the air,

578
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:41,664
the golden astral form of Pike with her extended
Sarenrae wings that slowly retract and vanish from

579
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:49,318
the form. As your gnomish friend kind of looks up,
her mostly corporeal form. Eyes wide, glancing up

580
00:38:49,318 --> 00:38:51,236
at the rest of you. Ashley, if you want to come
in.

581
00:38:51,236 --> 00:39:00,465
(all cheer)

582
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:03,145
SAM: As Pike, Ashley Johnson.

583
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:10,839
ASHLEY: Hello everybody. I wish it were better
circumstances. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

584
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:16,185
MATT: So Pike, the message came to you and you
immediately went into a frenzy. You were in the

585
00:39:16,185 --> 00:39:22,468
process of carrying a bunch of food along with
other volunteers within Emon, getting it to some

586
00:39:22,468 --> 00:39:27,752
of the folks that lost their homes. And when the
voice of Keyleth hit your ears, you immediately

587
00:39:27,752 --> 00:39:31,600
dropped what you were holding. You found somebody
to help to continue to lead this effort, and

588
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:36,285
immediately rushed off to find the nearest temple
of Sarenrae in Emon. Which still stands, slightly

589
00:39:36,285 --> 00:39:41,377
damaged, but it's still one of the buildings of
the temple district that's fine. There, you sat in

590
00:39:41,377 --> 00:39:46,375
quiet prayer for a number of minutes just
imploring to Sarenrae to offer you some sort of

591
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:52,706
guidance or way. And you felt something around you
shift, like a push, someone just kind of pushed

592
00:39:52,706 --> 00:39:59,456
you in the shoulders. And as your eyes opened, you
weren't in the temple anymore. You were above a

593
00:39:59,456 --> 00:40:05,605
floor in a brighter, sunlit, unfamiliar place. And
as you land and caught yourself, you can see-- You

594
00:40:05,605 --> 00:40:11,658
are in your astral form, much like in the
Whitestone experience. And you turn around and

595
00:40:11,658 --> 00:40:19,061
see, surrounding you in the center of this
open-air chamber in the center of this expansive

596
00:40:19,061 --> 00:40:27,358
ocean, your friends, their eyes locking to you
with a look of sudden joy and despair mingled.

597
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:36,040
MARISHA: Oh, thank Sarenrae. You heard. And I just
run up and-- I was going to give her a hug, and

598
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:43,497
then pat her astral form. I hug her.

599
00:40:43,987 --> 00:40:46,261
TRAVIS: Pike, we need your help.

600
00:40:46,261 --> 00:40:49,068
ASHLEY: Okay. What's happening?

601
00:40:51,647 --> 00:40:53,945
LAURA: (tearfully) It's Vax.

602
00:40:54,139 --> 00:40:55,995
MARISHA: Can you still do some sort of
resurrection?

603
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:56,963
ASHLEY: Yeah.

604
00:40:56,963 --> 00:40:58,490
MARISHA: From here?

605
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:03,087
ASHLEY: I think I can. I think I can, I will try.

606
00:41:04,847 --> 00:41:11,613
MARISHA: How is this going to work with him and
the Raven Queen? What do you know?

607
00:41:11,613 --> 00:41:13,664
Vex, do you know anything?

608
00:41:13,664 --> 00:41:16,395
LAURA: I know nothing.

609
00:41:16,395 --> 00:41:19,353
MARISHA: Do you know anything, Pike?

610
00:41:20,214 --> 00:41:29,168
ASHLEY: I don't know. I've never done anything
quite like this before. I mean, most of the time

611
00:41:29,168 --> 00:41:39,319
you guys have been there for resurrections, I
don't know. I don't know. We just have to try.

612
00:41:40,244 --> 00:41:41,444
MARISHA: Okay.

613
00:41:41,444 --> 00:41:46,775
TRAVIS: Is there anything on his armor? Like,
something we should be looking for? Like, a tab or

614
00:41:46,775 --> 00:41:50,240
a button or-- No?

615
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:55,349
LAURA: I look. For any sort of message from the
Raven Queen on his armor.

616
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:58,272
MATT: Make an investigation check.

617
00:42:03,133 --> 00:42:04,451
ASHLEY: That's good.

618
00:42:05,855 --> 00:42:09,537
LAURA: 20. What's five plus seven?

619
00:42:09,537 --> 00:42:10,836
LIAM: 32.

620
00:42:10,836 --> 00:42:12,107
LAURA: No! 22.

621
00:42:12,107 --> 00:42:14,019
LIAM: Oh, I thought you said 25.

622
00:42:14,019 --> 00:42:15,414
MATT: 22.

623
00:42:15,414 --> 00:42:16,225
LAURA: 22.

624
00:42:16,225 --> 00:42:23,444
MATT: I mean, most of the runic symbols and
designs on here aren't formulated in a sentence

625
00:42:23,444 --> 00:42:29,130
structure or language. You do see the roots of
them. Some of them are Draconic in root, but

626
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:36,265
they've been changed as part of the enchantment of
the armor. However, you do find a small, crumpled

627
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:38,363
note on the inside of the armor.

628
00:42:39,709 --> 00:42:40,992
LAURA: Can I pull it out?

629
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:43,857
MATT: Yeah.

630
00:42:43,857 --> 00:42:46,104
LAURA: What is it?

631
00:42:47,048 --> 00:42:48,900
MATT: It's up to you.

632
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,067
LAURA: I'm going to open it.

633
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:54,358
MATT: Okay. Do you want to tell her what's on it?

634
00:42:54,358 --> 00:42:58,928
LIAM: Oh, you want me to tell her? It just says
your name on it.

635
00:42:58,928 --> 00:43:00,612
LAURA: My-- Fuck.

636
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:03,939
LIAM: And it says, "Take these wings and fly."

637
00:43:03,939 --> 00:43:11,404
LAURA: Oh no. No. I just put it back in the
armor.

638
00:43:11,404 --> 00:43:13,356
MATT: Okay.

639
00:43:13,855 --> 00:43:16,791
LAURA: There's nothing.

640
00:43:21,008 --> 00:43:22,520
TRAVIS: Let's go get him.

641
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,627
MARISHA: Okay.

642
00:43:23,627 --> 00:43:26,108
LAURA: Can we start? He's been here for a while.
I'm sorry to

643
00:43:26,108 --> 00:43:29,025
bring you into this so quickly, Pike.

644
00:43:29,025 --> 00:43:31,939
ASHLEY: No, no, no. It's okay. I would rather be
here, and I'm glad that you guys called me.

645
00:43:31,939 --> 00:43:33,777
TRAVIS: Yeah.

646
00:43:34,798 --> 00:43:37,876
MATT: Because you're in your astral form, you
don't have the reagents with you. However,

647
00:43:37,876 --> 00:43:43,401
reagents can be provided by the party. You rummage
through, and you require a diamond of at least 500

648
00:43:43,401 --> 00:43:47,342
gold piece worth, which you have at your disposal,
so mark that off in the bag of holding.

649
00:43:47,342 --> 00:43:49,276
LAURA: I'll mark it off.

650
00:43:50,984 --> 00:43:55,137
MATT: Uvenda has already done a very good job of
preparing the space for a ritual not quite like

651
00:43:55,137 --> 00:44:01,215
the one you're used to, but a similar variation,
hers being druid-based magic. But you work with

652
00:44:01,215 --> 00:44:06,822
them over the next hour or so to take elements
they've already prepared and alter it to fit the

653
00:44:06,822 --> 00:44:14,278
ritual style that you're used to, formulating and
casting. As you finish preparation and your focus,

654
00:44:14,278 --> 00:44:20,282
clutching onto your holy symbol around your chest,
you feel the warmth of Sarenrae that brought you

655
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:26,635
here begin to swell around you. And you guys watch
as the ritual continues, Pike's form begins to

656
00:44:26,635 --> 00:44:32,473
just emit more and more light. The interior of
this temple, which is largely shaded by the roof

657
00:44:32,473 --> 00:44:39,234
of the temple, other than the sunlight coming in
from the open walls of it, the whole interior just

658
00:44:39,234 --> 00:44:47,900
begins to grow brighter from Pike's presence. As
the incantation begins to slowly drift from your

659
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:54,757
lips and the magic begins to flare, the circle
that was drawn around the body, the three parts of

660
00:44:54,816 --> 00:45:04,190
it-- The tricorner section of this glyph awaits.
Who wants to bring the first offering to the

661
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:11,520
ritual? The first attempt to bring.

662
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:26,999
LAURA: I'll do it. I kneel down next to him, and I
take the feathers from behind my ear, and I start

663
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:38,806
braiding them into his hair, and I say, you were
always better at this than I was, but you gave me

664
00:45:38,806 --> 00:45:44,997
these feathers in one of my darkest hours to
remind me of the beauty in the world, so I'm

665
00:45:44,997 --> 00:45:56,705
giving them to you now, because you take the
beauty with you. I've done this so many times.

666
00:45:56,705 --> 00:46:03,082
We've brought so many of us back, but this feels
different, right? I feel as if I'm not speaking to

667
00:46:03,144 --> 00:46:05,918
Vax, I feel as though I'm speaking directly to
Her.

668
00:46:05,918 --> 00:46:08,134
MARISHA: Speak to him.

669
00:46:08,482 --> 00:46:14,546
LAURA: No. No, he's at her side, but it's being
filtered through the Raven Queen. So these are my

670
00:46:14,546 --> 00:46:24,801
words to her. I'm here today because of a bargain
my brother made with you, so I know you like to

671
00:46:24,801 --> 00:46:42,200
make deals as much as I do. He traded his life. He
became your champion, and you spared mine, and

672
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:52,881
what a striking champion he is. Long dark hair and
a strong lithe figure soaring over the land in

673
00:46:52,881 --> 00:47:09,148
raven feathers and a dark vestige. He set pyres in
your honor. Sent soul after soul to you. It would

674
00:47:09,148 --> 00:47:27,252
be a shame to give that up, especially now. And I
remember the book that I read. Especially now as

675
00:47:27,252 --> 00:47:38,697
Orcus builds his forces against you. The demon
prince of the undead seeks to claim your throne.

676
00:47:38,697 --> 00:47:46,595
You know this as well as I. We just recently
killed one of his loyal servants in the Underdark,

677
00:47:46,595 --> 00:47:56,541
before my brother ever came into your service.
Imagine what he could do now. So this is the deal

678
00:47:56,541 --> 00:48:09,215
I make with you: you send him back, allow my
brother to come home, and we will seek out Orcus.

679
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:17,076
I will track him down, I will hunt him in whatever
pit he resides, and we will destroy your enemy

680
00:48:17,076 --> 00:48:22,962
once and for all. What say you?

681
00:48:28,051 --> 00:48:29,785
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

682
00:48:44,806 --> 00:48:46,712
LAURA: 25.

683
00:48:46,712 --> 00:48:51,663
MATT: Okay. The minute the words, what say you,
leave your lips, one third of the glyph

684
00:48:51,663 --> 00:49:01,287
(charging noise) vibrates to life. Where the golden
light of Sarenrae's power that the glyph initially

685
00:49:01,336 --> 00:49:11,469
emanates, the light, as it brightens, becomes a
purplish-blue hue. So.

686
00:49:12,626 --> 00:49:14,676
Who wishes to be the next offering?

687
00:49:16,553 --> 00:49:34,371
MARISHA: I'll go. I go up to him, and I prop up
his back and set him up against my chest and

688
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:57,738
whisper into his ear and say, I know you can hear
me. I know you're still in there, and I'm sure she

689
00:49:57,738 --> 00:50:11,537
can hear me too, but your sister is right. You've
held up to your promise, to her, and you've made a

690
00:50:11,537 --> 00:50:21,648
promise to me. We have to settle down and live
happily together, remember? You promised me.

691
00:50:21,648 --> 00:50:45,912
Vesrah. So I want to give you a little bit of
light to follow in the darkness. And I find the

692
00:50:45,912 --> 00:50:57,579
scar on his back of my handprint. And I find it
and I cast Daylight into his back, into the hand

693
00:50:57,579 --> 00:51:14,982
print and say, and besides... You know I'm in love
with you, right? (quietly) That's it.

694
00:51:16,845 --> 00:51:19,316
MATT: Roll a d20 and add your wisdom.

695
00:51:19,623 --> 00:51:33,019
MARISHA: God damn it (sniffles) Which dice? Okay.

696
00:51:37,272 --> 00:51:38,891
20 total.

697
00:51:38,938 --> 00:51:40,315
MATT: 20 total.

698
00:51:40,315 --> 00:51:46,268
MARISHA: Yeah. (whispering) Come on, come on, come
on.

699
00:51:46,268 --> 00:51:51,280
MATT: As the Daylight spell brightens, your
instinct is to close your eyes, but you push

700
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,532
against it, and you know this will temporarily
burn to your retinas but you still,

701
00:51:56,532 --> 00:51:57,960
holding that still--

702
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,418
MARISHA: I don't care.

703
00:51:59,418 --> 00:52:02,716
MATT: --whispering into him. You can feel, not
just the tears of your emotion but the instinctual

704
00:52:02,716 --> 00:52:08,336
pain of the blinding light piercing the inside of
your eyes, but you hold strong as you whisper to

705
00:52:08,336 --> 00:52:18,444
him and as the final word leaves your lips, the
second portion of the glyph grows alight and then

706
00:52:18,444 --> 00:52:26,950
transitions to that same purple-blue color. At
which point, the Daylight spell diminishes in a

707
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:33,034
way that you weren't expecting. As opposed to
being this bright, glowing, blasting beacon, it

708
00:52:33,034 --> 00:52:41,467
shrinks down to a small condensed gentle glow, and
you're afraid to move your hand.

709
00:52:41,467 --> 00:52:42,796
MARISHA: And I don't.

710
00:52:42,796 --> 00:52:46,544
MATT: Okay. There's the last offering.

711
00:52:49,117 --> 00:52:51,605
SAM: Do you think I should?

712
00:52:51,605 --> 00:52:52,840
TRAVIS: Shut the fuck up.

713
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,846
SAM: Oh, no?

714
00:52:53,846 --> 00:52:54,650
TRAVIS: Yeah.

715
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:55,724
(all laugh)

716
00:52:55,724 --> 00:52:56,822
SAM: All right.

717
00:52:56,822 --> 00:52:58,178
TALIESIN: You in?

718
00:52:58,178 --> 00:52:59,435
TRAVIS: Yeah.

719
00:52:59,435 --> 00:53:01,424
TALIESIN: All right.

720
00:53:02,193 --> 00:53:10,087
TRAVIS: I'll go, then. I go over to Vax. Is he on
a raised platform?

721
00:53:10,087 --> 00:53:16,007
MATT: No, actually, he's on the ground in a bed of
black feathers and currently is propped up against

722
00:53:16,007 --> 00:53:20,018
Keyleth's chest. She's sitting behind him so he's
leaning back against her,

723
00:53:20,018 --> 00:53:22,343
she has her hand against his back.

724
00:53:22,343 --> 00:53:37,978
TRAVIS: I'll stand over him. I told you before. No
one kills you but me. And I think back to being in

725
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:50,383
Percy's workshop at Greyskull Keep and I say, I
love you too. And I reach back

726
00:53:50,383 --> 00:53:57,661
and I slap the ever-loving fucking shit 
out of his dead face.

727
00:53:57,661 --> 00:54:00,499
(all laugh)

728
00:54:01,418 --> 00:54:02,695
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

729
00:54:02,695 --> 00:54:06,095
(all laugh)

730
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:09,094
MATT: Adding your strength.

731
00:54:09,094 --> 00:54:10,232
LIAM: Oh, jesus.

732
00:54:10,232 --> 00:54:11,221
TRAVIS: 22.

733
00:54:11,221 --> 00:54:21,730
MATT: 22, okay. (echoing cracks) Keyleth, it
knocks him out of your grasp,

734
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:24,047
the impact is so hard.

735
00:54:24,047 --> 00:54:27,272
MARISHA: I just keep my hand-- come on, you have
to be that hard?

736
00:54:27,272 --> 00:54:29,104
MATT: The body just kinda (boof) onto the side--

737
00:54:29,104 --> 00:54:30,048
LAURA: Oh!

738
00:54:30,048 --> 00:54:31,064
MATT: --you're like, oh god. You pick him back
up.

739
00:54:31,064 --> 00:54:32,148
TRAVIS: Love hurts, Keyleth.

740
00:54:32,148 --> 00:54:33,042
MARISHA: I was-- oh shit.

741
00:54:33,042 --> 00:54:34,613
SAM: I just let out a (yelps).

742
00:54:34,613 --> 00:54:38,022
(all laugh)

743
00:54:38,085 --> 00:54:46,044
MATT: The third and final portion of the circular
glyph alights, and then transitions to that

744
00:54:46,044 --> 00:54:54,858
purplish-blue glow, the entire circle complete.
Oh, I want another dice.

745
00:54:55,302 --> 00:54:56,286
LAURA: Oh god, oh god.

746
00:54:56,286 --> 00:55:00,809
MARISHA: Oh jesus.

747
00:55:00,928 --> 00:55:02,182
MARISHA: Why is he taking a picture again?

748
00:55:02,182 --> 00:55:03,195
LAURA: He always does that.

749
00:55:03,195 --> 00:55:04,949
SAM: He always takes a picture, he always takes a
picture. It's a thing.

750
00:55:04,949 --> 00:55:20,461
MARISHA: Oh, fucking hell. Oh jesus, come on.

751
00:55:21,917 --> 00:55:30,767
MATT: The glyphs go dark and so does the light of
the outside. The entire central chamber goes dark,

752
00:55:30,767 --> 00:55:42,943
the light being crushed and squeezed from the
vicinity. You watch as the air gets cold and a

753
00:55:42,943 --> 00:55:54,779
slight breeze picks up and in the darkness around
you, surrounding the lifeless body of Vax, all you

754
00:55:54,779 --> 00:56:04,490
see is your family and darkness and there is a
glowing little thread, a bead, in the sternum of

755
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:14,256
Vax's lifeless corpse and you watch as a hand
suddenly appears from out of the darkness and

756
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:20,876
reaches down and grasps the thread, and emerging
from the darkness, you all see for the first time

757
00:56:21,024 --> 00:56:31,257
the white, porcelain masked face of the Raven
Queen. As she tugs on the small bead, you watch as

758
00:56:31,257 --> 00:56:40,307
a bright, white thread begins to be drawn from the
center of his chest and as it does he lifts up

759
00:56:40,307 --> 00:56:44,962
like a puppet, just limply dangling from it. He's
lifted out of your grasp and Keyleth, you

760
00:56:44,962 --> 00:56:51,864
instinctually try and reach for him but this
spectacle is-- you find yourself unable to move,

761
00:56:51,864 --> 00:56:58,422
whether it be by some other power or just the
sheer awe of some sort of a presence here. As he's

762
00:56:58,422 --> 00:57:09,478
dangled up on this thread, she stops and holds him
there. The mask looks past all of you and without

763
00:57:09,478 --> 00:57:27,004
the mouth moving a voice fills your minds. "My
champion has learned much and has done great deeds

764
00:57:27,067 --> 00:57:30,219
"in the service of fate."

765
00:57:34,016 --> 00:57:42,315
"But there is still much to
be done before my charge is complete in him."

766
00:57:42,315 --> 00:57:48,688
She releases the thread and he drifts down onto his
feet, arms and head still limp. It slowly

767
00:57:48,688 --> 00:58:02,525
withdraws into his chest. "We shall meet again.
Come find me when the time is right and I call to

768
00:58:02,525 --> 00:58:10,076
"you to meet me beyond the divine gate." And as the
mask withdraws into shadow and her form vanishes

769
00:58:10,076 --> 00:58:16,660
into darkness, suddenly the light comes back in.
You all kinda close your eyes and blink it and the

770
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:21,915
visions gone and you see all the servants around,
still standing in the places they were just

771
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:29,170
looking intently at Vax, their eyes still wide
open and you watch as the limp, standing form

772
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:39,580
there before you, the wings of black feathers
slowly stretch out from his shoulders (crackling)

773
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:44,121
and as they reach out and stretch and open, his
head pulls back and

774
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:51,049
(heavy breath) takes a breath of living air into 
his lungs and his eyes blink open.

775
00:59:07,997 --> 00:59:09,739
TRAVIS: How do you feel?

776
00:59:11,958 --> 00:59:23,543
LIAM: Where are we? I just loop my sister's head
and then I loop Keyleth and I just pull them in.

777
00:59:23,543 --> 00:59:26,503
(gasps) Where are we?

778
00:59:26,714 --> 00:59:42,675
LAURA: Vesrah. You're alive. (laughs) Hey, that
queen, she's pretty scary looking, huh?

779
00:59:44,124 --> 00:59:52,928
MARISHA: Yeah, you're not kidding, that's pretty
intense.

780
00:59:54,777 --> 00:59:56,399
ASHLEY: Hi Vax.

781
00:59:56,399 --> 00:59:58,662
LIAM: Welcome to my last four months.

782
00:59:58,662 --> 01:00:00,137
LAURA: (laughs) Hey, Pike.

783
01:00:00,182 --> 01:00:01,741
ASHLEY: Hi, it's Pickle.

784
01:00:01,854 --> 01:00:02,856
LAURA: Pike's here.

785
01:00:02,916 --> 01:00:04,255
(shaky laughter)

786
01:00:04,317 --> 01:00:05,550
LIAM: Pike.

787
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:06,528
MARISHA: She did it again.

788
01:00:06,528 --> 01:00:07,608
LAURA: She fixed you.

789
01:00:07,608 --> 01:00:09,304
ASHLEY: No, I didn't.

790
01:00:09,563 --> 01:00:11,713
LIAM: Can I feel you?

791
01:00:13,214 --> 01:00:22,497
MATT: There is some physicality to her divine
form. Pike feels like she's there, like she can be

792
01:00:22,497 --> 01:00:29,778
held and touched, but it's like touching a warm,
soft Jello.

793
01:00:30,531 --> 01:00:35,354
ASHLEY: I go and I give him a big 'ol hug. A
Jello-y hug. Gloop!

794
01:00:35,752 --> 01:00:41,177
MATT: Or like a big piece of cotton. It's softer
and gives a bit.

795
01:00:41,389 --> 01:00:42,784
MARISHA: Cotton candy Pike.

796
01:00:42,784 --> 01:00:44,206
MATT: Kinda, yeah. Kinda.

797
01:00:44,206 --> 01:00:54,099
LIAM: I take hold of the Jello head and press my
head into it and say, thank you, sister.

798
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,059
ASHLEY: Of course, Vax.

799
01:00:57,059 --> 01:00:58,279
LIAM: Thank you.

800
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:02,893
ASHLEY: I give him a cotton candy kiss on his
forehead.

801
01:01:02,955 --> 01:01:04,734
TRAVIS: Aw, man.

802
01:01:04,734 --> 01:01:09,459
MATT: As she does so, and she releases your head,
Vax, you look at her face and you look up and just

803
01:01:09,459 --> 01:01:16,399
behind her, you see the mask there, and the voice
comes to your head. None of you see this, just

804
01:01:16,399 --> 01:01:27,202
Vax. And says, "Soon. I'll call for your purpose.
In time." And it just fades and you can now see

805
01:01:27,202 --> 01:01:30,964
the sea beyond the midday of Vesrah now
surrounding you.

806
01:01:36,048 --> 01:01:38,154
LIAM: Whoa. Hey, I feel like shit.

807
01:01:38,154 --> 01:01:39,801
LAURA: Hey welcome to the club.

808
01:01:39,801 --> 01:01:41,325
TRAVIS: Yeah, you punched your card.

809
01:01:41,325 --> 01:01:42,696
LAURA: Yeah, all that's left now is Keyleth.

810
01:01:42,696 --> 01:01:47,100
MATT: Which, by the way, your jaw is sore and
you're pretty sure you're missing a tooth.

811
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:49,136
LAURA: Oh!

812
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:52,434
TRAVIS: Can't grow that back, bitch.

813
01:01:52,434 --> 01:01:56,137
MATT: Okay, yeah.

814
01:01:56,137 --> 01:02:05,298
LIAM: (spits) I walk over to Grog, and I try to
reach my arms around him and fail.

815
01:02:05,298 --> 01:02:08,502
You fucking fucker, come here.

816
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:11,317
TRAVIS: Yeah, welcome back. Don't be weird.

817
01:02:11,317 --> 01:02:14,747
LIAM: Ah, you've met me, right?

818
01:02:14,747 --> 01:02:15,744
TRAVIS: That's true.

819
01:02:15,744 --> 01:02:16,938
LIAM: Yeah.

820
01:02:24,135 --> 01:02:32,423
MARISHA: Glad you're not dead. Really glad you're
not dead.

821
01:02:33,102 --> 01:02:35,568
LIAM: Me too.

822
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:39,342
LAURA: Do you need to rest? Do you need to go lay
down?

823
01:02:39,342 --> 01:02:40,371
LIAM: Don't we all?

824
01:02:40,371 --> 01:02:41,787
MARISHA: I feel like we all need to rest.

825
01:02:41,787 --> 01:02:42,487
LAURA: Well yes, but--

826
01:02:42,487 --> 01:02:44,026
TRAVIS: I'm good.

827
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:45,476
MARISHA: I turn to Uvenda.

828
01:02:45,476 --> 01:02:49,831
MATT: Okay. She's still kind of like, "Well. I'm
glad to see that this was a success. That your

829
01:02:49,831 --> 01:02:52,321
"friend could come in aid as well."

830
01:02:54,275 --> 01:02:56,412
MARISHA: Grog. Tary.

831
01:02:56,644 --> 01:02:57,491
SAM: Yes?

832
01:02:57,491 --> 01:02:58,741
MARISHA: The lodestones.

833
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:01,326
LAURA: Oh. I pull mine out as well.

834
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:10,827
SAM: Oh. Oh, yes. I hereby present to you a
lodestone that I got at the bottom of the sea.

835
01:03:11,772 --> 01:03:14,003
MARISHA: Yeah. Good job, good job. Good work.

836
01:03:14,421 --> 01:03:16,672
MATT: She kind of points over and the servants
come up and collect the three of them and she

837
01:03:16,672 --> 01:03:26,467
goes, "Well, this is fine news. I was worried that
we had a loss, and perhaps this endeavor was

838
01:03:26,467 --> 01:03:38,698
"incomplete. However, it appears that you've both
survived the encounter with the current scourge to

839
01:03:38,698 --> 01:03:50,006
"Vesrah's rift, and you've completed your
Aramente, young Keyleth. There will be a

840
01:03:50,081 --> 01:03:53,283
"celebration tonight before we send you back to
Zephra,

841
01:03:53,283 --> 01:03:58,054
"where you will be formally crowned by your 
father, Korren."

842
01:04:00,041 --> 01:04:04,761
MARISHA: Oh, that's happening tonight? Oh wow,
this stuff moves fast, yeah

843
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:14,408
MATT: "We'll celebrate this evening. You'll return
at your leisure, but--" And she kind of walks up

844
01:04:14,408 --> 01:04:23,355
to you, and she can see the tears, and she kind of
reaches up with her wrinkled, sun-wrecked, elderly

845
01:04:23,355 --> 01:04:31,822
gnome skin. And reaches up and rubs the tears from
your face and goes, "It's all right. You've done

846
01:04:31,822 --> 01:04:35,412
"well. And I'm sorry."

847
01:04:37,332 --> 01:04:38,912
MARISHA: For what?

848
01:04:40,494 --> 01:04:52,770
MATT: "For a lot of things. The Aramente didn't
used to be this dangerous. It's tradition, but our

849
01:04:52,770 --> 01:05:06,120
"trial has changed, and while we grew confident in
your confidence upon arrival, we should've been

850
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:10,263
"more attentive. This might not have happened."

851
01:05:13,036 --> 01:05:20,139
MARISHA: No. It was my negligence in proper
planning that added to this.

852
01:05:20,862 --> 01:05:25,184
MATT: "That may be the lesson learned at this
trial. But I think we have learned a lesson as

853
01:05:25,184 --> 01:05:32,939
"well. And perhaps we need to adjust our trial,
given the dangers

854
01:05:32,939 --> 01:05:37,579
"of our recent elemental guardian."

855
01:05:38,321 --> 01:05:43,311
MARISHA: I think the landscape of the world has
changed a lot recently, and I think the Aramente

856
01:05:43,311 --> 01:05:50,398
should reflect that. So I would be honored to
provide any insight to help.

857
01:05:53,299 --> 01:05:59,860
MATT: "Well, come back. Come back once you've
returned to your people and become the Voice of

858
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:13,783
"the Tempest. Then we may alter however you see
fit. Anyway, glad you're awake!"

859
01:06:13,783 --> 01:06:15,447
Taps you on the head with the staff.

860
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,660
TRAVIS: Unconscious.

861
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:18,686
(all laugh)

862
01:06:18,686 --> 01:06:19,813
MATT: "Shit!"

863
01:06:21,082 --> 01:06:24,833
LAURA: How many people lose their lives on their
Aramente? How many people complete it?

864
01:06:26,588 --> 01:06:32,987
MATT: "Well, the Aramente is generally not a
lethal experience. The kraken only arrived this

865
01:06:32,987 --> 01:06:41,192
"recent generation, and honestly, the only two
who's had to take it with the kraken's presence

866
01:06:41,192 --> 01:06:43,727
"were Keyleth and her mother."

867
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,246
MARISHA: What?

868
01:06:48,919 --> 01:06:51,877
TALIESIN: I'd been hoping to run a perception
check through pretty much this entire

869
01:06:51,877 --> 01:06:55,501
conversation, to make sure she's being completely
honest about everything.

870
01:06:55,501 --> 01:06:56,796
MATT: Insight check, you mean?

871
01:06:56,796 --> 01:07:03,063
TALIESIN: Yeah, an insight check. Meh, 13.

872
01:07:03,063 --> 01:07:05,142
MATT: 13. Hard to read.

873
01:07:05,142 --> 01:07:06,002
TALIESIN: Okay.

874
01:07:06,002 --> 01:07:08,730
MATT: She seems to be upfront.

875
01:07:09,415 --> 01:07:16,438
MARISHA: What do you mean? Why were we the only
ones with the tools?

876
01:07:17,288 --> 01:07:22,432
MATT: "Well, before the kraken came to the rift,
it was simply an excursion to gather the

877
01:07:22,432 --> 01:07:30,340
"lodestones amongst errant elementals and other
mild dangers within the plane. The kraken had only

878
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:31,765
"been drawn to the rift--"

879
01:07:32,321 --> 01:07:33,389
MARISHA: Recently.

880
01:07:33,389 --> 01:07:38,560
MATT: "-- recently. And unfortunately, Vilya was
the first to take the trial

881
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:44,063
"with it residing just beyond our door."

882
01:07:44,063 --> 01:07:46,533
LAURA: How many people did she have with her?

883
01:07:46,533 --> 01:07:48,639
MATT: "She went in with five."

884
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:51,079
MARISHA: And none returned?

885
01:07:51,079 --> 01:07:56,170
MATT: "None. Two of which were our own."

886
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:58,098
MARISHA: I'm sorry.

887
01:07:58,098 --> 01:08:06,664
MATT: "That's the danger we face in these times.
To exist among such ravaging elemental forces is

888
01:08:06,664 --> 01:08:14,678
"a danger unto itself. But that is the call of the
Ashari by nature, is it not?"

889
01:08:14,739 --> 01:08:16,498
MARISHA: Yes, it is.

890
01:08:16,498 --> 01:08:25,349
MATT: "To safeguard the rest of civilization from
these terrors. Anyway, enough dourness. It got

891
01:08:25,349 --> 01:08:30,826
"rather cold here and I think we could use some
warming heat of the sun, some food and perhaps

892
01:08:30,826 --> 01:08:32,908
"some rest for you." Hits you again on the
forehead.

893
01:08:34,797 --> 01:08:36,711
LIAM: I'm alive.

894
01:08:37,206 --> 01:08:42,930
MARISHA: Do you mind if we take a brief respite
amongst ourselves, before we catch up with you and

895
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:45,422
join in the festivities?

896
01:08:45,422 --> 01:08:51,386
MATT: "But of course! It's--" And she looks at the
sun. "It's about time for my sailing, so I'll see

897
01:08:51,386 --> 01:08:56,458
"you here in the next hour or two." And she goes,
and two of her servants start

898
01:08:56,458 --> 01:08:59,616
flanking her down the stairway.

899
01:08:59,951 --> 01:09:01,987
MARISHA: Kaitiaki, Uvenda.

900
01:09:01,987 --> 01:09:12,199
MATT: She stops and turns, looking back at all of
you, and gives a deep bow. "Kaitiaki." Continues

901
01:09:12,199 --> 01:09:14,168
to make her way down the stairs.

902
01:09:17,711 --> 01:09:18,886
ASHLEY: Keyleth.

903
01:09:18,886 --> 01:09:22,151
MARISHA: Group hug, guys, group hug!

904
01:09:22,151 --> 01:09:23,958
TRAVIS: You did it.

905
01:09:23,958 --> 01:09:25,408
MARISHA: Come here, Tary, you too.

906
01:09:25,408 --> 01:09:31,738
SAM: Oh, me too? All right, okay. Sure, sure. This
is natural, this is right.

907
01:09:31,738 --> 01:09:33,438
LIAM: Who is that?

908
01:09:33,438 --> 01:09:34,957
LAURA: What are you talking about, 'who is that'?

909
01:09:34,957 --> 01:09:37,471
LIAM: That guy, who is that guy?

910
01:09:37,471 --> 01:09:39,884
LAURA: What are you talking about, that is Taryon.

911
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:46,437
SAM: Oh, come now. You recognize me. Taryon
Darrington! The brave, the bold. We both fell in

912
01:09:46,437 --> 01:09:48,860
battle, so I know exactly how you feel right now.

913
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:50,899
LIAM: Oh, I've read your book!

914
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:51,601
SAM: Well.

915
01:09:51,601 --> 01:09:53,090
LIAM: I know you.

916
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:54,555
LAURA: I didn't think it was published yet.

917
01:09:54,555 --> 01:09:59,587
SAM: Not quite yet, but I'm sure people are
already talking about it.

918
01:09:59,587 --> 01:10:01,319
LIAM: How did you do, Tary?

919
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:02,999
SAM: Well--

920
01:10:02,999 --> 01:10:04,421
TRAVIS: Yeah, how did you do, Tary?

921
01:10:04,421 --> 01:10:05,676
TALIESIN: Well, he did well.

922
01:10:05,676 --> 01:10:06,789
SAM: Doty, take this down.

923
01:10:06,789 --> 01:10:10,107
MATT: Which, as you look over, Doty has been faced
away from the entire ritual and had been recording

924
01:10:10,107 --> 01:10:15,425
the various weather elements and surroundings.

925
01:10:15,425 --> 01:10:21,261
SAM: Doty, no! We just witnessed an amazing
ritual. Did you not get any of that?

926
01:10:21,261 --> 01:10:25,100
MATT: Turns the book around and you can see it
talks about cloud structures, it talks about a few

927
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:29,689
children that were playing in the water below.

928
01:10:29,689 --> 01:10:39,413
SAM: Well, you are consistent. I'll fill you in on
the details of that later, but now take this down.

929
01:10:39,413 --> 01:10:48,717
'Plagued by an incompetent plan and ambushed by a
surprise from a kraken, we nevertheless stayed

930
01:10:48,778 --> 01:10:57,192
'true to ourselves and to our bravery, found the
lodestones and, despite nearly dying, came back to

'tell the tale, proving ourselves as heroes of
Vesrah and to each other. I was aided by young

932
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:12,350
'Percival in my fight. Abandoned by the Antlers and
the Elves. And by the end of the fight, it was

933
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:19,385
'just me and the big guy, duking it out. I blacked
out for a moment, but before I did, I'm sure he

934

'saw my bravery and was impressed. That's why he
dragged me to safety and presented me to Percival

935
01:11:26,384 --> 01:11:29,080
'for healing.' That's enough for now.

936
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:32,486
LAURA: You forgot to mention the part where you
vomited and blew our cover.

937
01:11:32,486 --> 01:11:34,140
MARISHA: Oh, that's right, you did do that.

938
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:35,052
LAURA: Thank you.

939
01:11:35,052 --> 01:11:40,240
SAM: It's not-- This is the abridged-- I don't
want to bore the readers with too much detail.

940
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:45,563
TRAVIS: It's so weird. I totally remember walking
past you and trying to leave.

941
01:11:45,563 --> 01:11:51,880
SAM: Somehow, I got to the rift door and I didn't
get there on my own, so thank you. Thank you, Big

942
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:55,239
Guy, for dragging me there. I appreciate it.

943
01:11:55,902 --> 01:11:57,959
LAURA: Um, Pike.

944
01:11:57,959 --> 01:11:59,078
SAM: Oh!

945
01:11:59,078 --> 01:12:05,755
ASHLEY: Have I met-- I don't know-- My memory is
not-- Who are you?

946
01:12:05,755 --> 01:12:10,622
SAM: Taryon Darrington. We passed briefly in
Whitestone.

947
01:12:10,622 --> 01:12:11,957
MATT: Briefly, yes.

948
01:12:11,957 --> 01:12:20,999
ASHLEY: Yes, I didn't realize you were still with
my family.

949
01:12:20,999 --> 01:12:23,790
SAM: I'll switch to Gnome.

950
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:24,977
ASHLEY: Oh, it's fine, I can--

951
01:12:24,977 --> 01:12:28,903
SAM: And I'll say, oh, you're friendly with these
people as well?

952
01:12:28,903 --> 01:12:30,132
ASHLEY: Ah, yes.

953
01:12:30,132 --> 01:12:35,163
SAM: They've taken me in and they're showing me
the ropes of adventure, and we've already done

954
01:12:35,163 --> 01:12:38,785
quite a lot. We were on a boat that was attacked.

955
01:12:38,785 --> 01:12:40,153
ASHLEY: Oh wow.

956
01:12:40,153 --> 01:12:45,804
SAM: And we almost died, but I destroyed the beast
that was attacking us with a bit of magic.

957
01:12:45,804 --> 01:12:48,118
ASHLEY: How did you destroy it? Do tell me.

958
01:12:48,118 --> 01:12:54,667
SAM: I have a lot of tricks. Magical things that I
think you might even understand, because it seems

959
01:12:54,667 --> 01:12:57,929
that you are a magic user yourself.

960
01:12:57,929 --> 01:13:01,148
ASHLEY: I dabble.

961
01:13:01,148 --> 01:13:05,907
SAM: The resurrection thing that you just did was
amazing. I've never seen anything like it, and it

962
01:13:05,907 --> 01:13:12,910
was quite astounding for somehow who's not really
here. Hello?

963
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:15,565
MATT: Your hand (impact sounds) does actually hit
the side of her face.

964
01:13:15,565 --> 01:13:17,462
SAM: Oh! Sorry, sorry.

965
01:13:17,462 --> 01:13:19,058
LAURA: And they're speaking this whole time in
Gnome?

966
01:13:19,058 --> 01:13:22,516
MATT: Yeah. This whole time, you've been hearing
(talks Gnome).

967
01:13:22,516 --> 01:13:29,843
SAM: By the way, how is my accent? I haven't had a
chance to practice Gnome on an actual gnome in a

968
01:13:29,843 --> 01:13:32,203
long, long time, since I was a boy.

969
01:13:32,203 --> 01:13:33,205
ASHLEY: It's terrible.

970
01:13:33,205 --> 01:13:34,199
SAM: Oh.

971
01:13:34,199 --> 01:13:37,842
ASHLEY: But it's nice to be able to speak it.

972
01:13:37,842 --> 01:13:44,049
SAM: I apologize profusely for butchering your
language. I learned it by books, and, as I've

973
01:13:44,049 --> 01:13:50,088
said, I've only had a chance to speak it once
before to a gnome who visited

974
01:13:50,088 --> 01:13:53,715
my family's estate a long time ago.

975
01:13:53,715 --> 01:13:59,341
ASHLEY: Oh? All gnomes know each other, so who was
it?

976
01:14:00,572 --> 01:14:03,467
SAM: I didn't catch the fellow's name.

977
01:14:04,427 --> 01:14:06,483
ASHLEY: It was a fellow, that narrows it down.

978
01:14:06,483 --> 01:14:14,089
SAM: He was part of a performing troupe that my
father hired to entertain us on New Year's Eve.

979
01:14:14,089 --> 01:14:22,394
And they came in, stayed a few days. I remember
quite vividly though that they left in a hurry.

980
01:14:22,394 --> 01:14:29,408
Something went on with one of the members of the
troupe and my father's handmaiden, and he was very

981
01:14:29,408 --> 01:14:34,474
upset with it and he chased them all off in the
morning. I didn't get to continue practicing with

982
01:14:34,474 --> 01:14:40,286
him. All I know is, my father was so upset.
Something happened in his room, he had to burn his

983
01:14:40,286 --> 01:14:49,371
bedsheets, and I think he got a new bed. I don't
know quite what happened, but it was quite a

984
01:14:49,371 --> 01:14:54,351
dramatic thing. I was only about 12 or 13 at the
time.

985
01:14:54,351 --> 01:15:03,100
ASHLEY: That sounds like somebody that I would
love tremendously.

986
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:10,005
SAM: Well, he had a sharp wit to him, and-- not
very attractive young man, but--

987
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:13,956
ASHLEY: He sounds very familiar. Like I said, us
gnomes do know each other.

988
01:15:13,956 --> 01:15:15,093
SAM: That's amazing.

989
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:16,025
ASHLEY: Yeah.

990
01:15:16,025 --> 01:15:19,599
SAM: Really? And is it true that you live hundreds
of years, and--

991
01:15:19,599 --> 01:15:21,550
ASHLEY: Thousands, even.

992
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:22,660
SAM: Is-- Oh! I--

993
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:23,745
ASHLEY: Thousands.

994
01:15:23,745 --> 01:15:24,899
SAM: I was misinformed.

995
01:15:24,899 --> 01:15:27,099
ASHLEY: It's something you should know. Yes, I
should-- if you need to know anything, you should

996
01:15:27,099 --> 01:15:28,059
always ask me.

997
01:15:28,059 --> 01:15:28,899
SAM: I will. I--

998
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:30,675
ASHLEY: I will tell you all the truths.

999
01:15:30,675 --> 01:15:35,637
SAM: I will-- I was planning on doing at least one
chapter in my book about the smaller races, and

1000
01:15:35,637 --> 01:15:37,492
that would be an excellent--

1001
01:15:37,492 --> 01:15:38,653
MARISHA: Oh boy.

1002
01:15:38,653 --> 01:15:40,624
SAM: -- an excellent fitting, uh, addendum.

1003
01:15:40,624 --> 01:15:43,246
ASHLEY: (laughs) Well.

1004
01:15:43,246 --> 01:15:45,910
TALIESIN: Yeah. Yeah.

1005
01:15:45,910 --> 01:15:47,729
ASHLEY: You are just delightful.

1006
01:15:47,803 --> 01:15:50,061
(all laugh)

1007
01:15:50,061 --> 01:15:54,485
SAM: Well you-- you are, too. Pleasure to meet--
make your acquaintance.

1008
01:15:54,485 --> 01:15:56,850
ASHLEY: (laughs) Okay.

1009
01:15:57,178 --> 01:15:59,864
TRAVIS: You can feel free to smoke this fool, it's
fine.

1010
01:15:59,864 --> 01:16:01,837
ASHLEY: No, that's fine. He's a little bit of a
twat, isn't he?

1011
01:16:01,837 --> 01:16:04,045
TRAVIS: A little bit.

1012
01:16:04,045 --> 01:16:08,252
ASHLEY: I don't mind him, though. All right.

1013
01:16:08,252 --> 01:16:19,239
MATT: All right. So. As you guys take a little bit
of time to go ahead and rest, recover, converse,

1014
01:16:19,384 --> 01:16:21,722
and bask in--

1015
01:16:21,722 --> 01:16:23,062
MARISHA: Heal up a bit?

1016
01:16:23,062 --> 01:16:28,139
MATT: Heal up a bit, take a short rest, use your
hit dice, get your abilities back that do come

1017
01:16:28,139 --> 01:16:35,080
back from a short rest, we're gonna go ahead and
take a quick break. Be back here in a few minutes.

1018
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,365
Hold onto that back-up character!

1019
01:16:37,365 --> 01:16:38,222
SAM: Oh!

1020
01:16:38,222 --> 01:16:39,123
MATT: 'Til later.

1021
01:16:39,123 --> 01:16:40,407
LAURA: Oh, until later, okay, okay.

1022
01:16:40,407 --> 01:16:41,299
MARISHA: In case.

1023
01:16:41,299 --> 01:16:43,993
LIAM: I'm 98% relieved and 2% bummed that I--

1024
01:16:43,993 --> 01:16:44,791
MATT: I know!

1025
01:16:44,791 --> 01:16:46,233
TALIESIN: No, I know the feeling, man.

1026
01:16:46,233 --> 01:16:47,973
MATT: I know. Who knows, it may still come up.

1027
01:16:47,973 --> 01:16:48,601
LIAM: Yeah.

1028
01:16:48,601 --> 01:16:50,035
MATT: (laughs)

1029
01:16:50,035 --> 01:16:52,438
TRAVIS: What does that mean?! We don't know what
that means! You can't say that shit!

1030
01:16:52,438 --> 01:16:53,418
MATT: What?

1031
01:16:53,418 --> 01:16:56,218
LIAM: Raven Queen. Just kidding! (weird caw
noise)

1032
01:16:56,218 --> 01:16:58,548
TRAVIS: Raven King! Wooloolooloo!

1033
01:16:58,548 --> 01:17:01,967
MATT: It's almost like future challenges in the
story might involve more death, I don't know.

1034
01:17:01,967 --> 01:17:02,756
LAURA: Uh-huh.

1035
01:17:02,756 --> 01:17:04,350
ASHLEY: I'm eating my feelings.

1036
01:17:04,350 --> 01:17:07,165
(all laugh)

1037
01:17:07,165 --> 01:17:08,915
MATT: Yeah, a little disappointed, but this works
well.

1038
01:17:08,915 --> 01:17:10,304
LAURA: So we'll heal up now.

1039
01:17:10,304 --> 01:17:14,180
MATT: Yeah, heal up now, we're gonna take a break,
we'll be here in a few minutes, guys. Much love.

1040
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:17,309
We have another giveaway from our friends at
Wyrmwood tonight! I don't know what we're giving

1041
01:17:17,309 --> 01:17:18,909
away, 'cause I was to give--

1042
01:17:18,909 --> 01:17:20,360
CREW: Dice tower. Dice tower!

1043
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:27,850
MATT: A dice tower! Oh, snap. You guys are getting
a full-scale dice tower. What is it? It is wood.

1044
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:29,973
It is made of wood and it is a dice tower.

1045
01:17:29,973 --> 01:17:31,303
CREW: We're running it up to you!

1046
01:17:31,303 --> 01:17:35,985
MATT: And it's gonna be free to the winner! So,
come on over to the Twitch chat, and get involved

1047
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:40,019
over the break. The word is raven, R-A-V-E-N.

1048
01:17:40,019 --> 01:17:41,233
TRAVIS: 69 hit points.

1049
01:17:41,233 --> 01:17:47,032
MATT: Go ahead and-- Yeah you are, Grog. Oh. Oh
snap! That is not a dice tower--

1050
01:17:47,032 --> 01:17:48,269
CREW: Not a dice tower.

1051
01:17:48,269 --> 01:17:49,601
MATT: -- it's a deck box.

1052
01:17:49,601 --> 01:17:50,607
CREW: Sentinel box.

1053
01:17:50,607 --> 01:17:56,983
MATT: Sentinel box! Which is still rad. They told
me it was a-- but however-- oh, that's cool! It

1054
01:17:56,983 --> 01:18:01,230
has like a small magnetic-- must be for minis
and-- or dice, if you want to. So that's pretty

1055
01:18:01,230 --> 01:18:05,720
rad, actually. So anyway, this 'Bird's Eye Maple
Sentinel Deck Box' is gonna go

1056
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,183
to whoever the winner is.

1057
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:08,284
TRAVIS: Oh, that's pretty.

1058
01:18:08,284 --> 01:18:10,946
MATT: Type 'Raven' into the chat room of Twitch to
win. We'll have an announcement when we come back.

1059
01:18:10,946 --> 01:18:12,512
See you guys in a few minutes.

1060
01:18:12,512 --> 01:18:14,137
(all cheer)

1061
01:18:14,137 --> 01:36:04,906
[break]

1062
01:36:04,976 --> 01:36:06,755
MATT: Welcome back, everyone, to Critical Role.

1063
01:36:06,755 --> 01:36:08,204
(background laughter)

1064
01:36:08,204 --> 01:36:16,207
MATT: Damn it. First and foremost, I wanna mention
that our fantastic fundly to Amandine is

1065
01:36:16,207 --> 01:36:18,193
apparently already really close to its goal!

1066
01:36:18,193 --> 01:36:20,789
(cheers)

1067
01:36:20,789 --> 01:36:31,065
MATT: So if you guys want to check it out, it's
fundly.com/we-love-amandine A-M-A-N-D-I-N-E. If

1068
01:36:31,065 --> 01:36:33,407
you can give anything, we're almost at the goal,
which is awesome.

1069
01:36:33,407 --> 01:36:34,457
TRAVIS: That's amazing.

1070
01:36:34,457 --> 01:36:35,418
MATT: Also, we have the winner in chat!

1071
01:36:35,418 --> 01:36:36,582
SAM: (loud burp)

1072
01:36:36,582 --> 01:36:37,501
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

1073
01:36:37,501 --> 01:36:38,236
TALIESIN: Whoa.

1074
01:36:38,236 --> 01:36:39,162
SAM: Sorry. Still reeling.

1075
01:36:39,162 --> 01:36:40,085
TALIESIN: How you feeling, buddy?

1076
01:36:40,085 --> 01:36:41,518
SAM: Still reeling.

1077
01:36:41,518 --> 01:36:48,212
MATT: We have the winner in chat of our fantastic
deck box from our friends at Wyrmwood, it is

1078
01:36:48,369 --> 01:36:52,082
@stevetharia! @stevetharia, you are the winner,
we're gonna go ahead and sign that box and get it

1079
01:36:52,082 --> 01:36:56,816
sent to you, that Sentinel box. Congratulations.
We'll have more giveaways in future episodes, so

1080
01:36:56,816 --> 01:37:02,106
if you didn't get it tonight, come back again, and
have another chance, which is awesome! All right.

1081
01:37:02,106 --> 01:37:11,960
So. Bringing us back in. You guys have had some
time to recover, gather your thoughts, gather your

1082
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:22,248
wits, and reflect on the recent near-permanent
loss of your Champion of the Raven Queen,

1083
01:37:22,248 --> 01:37:29,057
Vax'ildan. You now currently sit wherever you'd
like within the city of Vesrah in preparation for

1084
01:37:29,057 --> 01:37:34,684
an evening celebration. Is there anything you guys
wish to do in the meantime?

1085
01:37:34,684 --> 01:37:39,264
LIAM: How much time has passed since I got brought
back up there?

1086
01:37:39,264 --> 01:37:39,918
MATT: About an hour.

1087
01:37:39,918 --> 01:37:40,592
LIAM: About an hour?

1088
01:37:40,592 --> 01:37:41,242
MATT: Yeah.

1089
01:37:41,242 --> 01:37:42,001
LIAM: A little over an hour?

1090
01:37:42,001 --> 01:37:42,846
MATT: A little over an hour, I'd say.

1091
01:37:42,846 --> 01:37:43,803
LIAM: A little over an hour?

1092
01:37:43,803 --> 01:37:44,881
MATT: Just from resting, yeah.

1093
01:37:44,881 --> 01:37:47,631
LIAM: Just out of curiosity, do my wings 'shloop'
back in?

1094
01:37:47,631 --> 01:37:48,717
MATT: Yes, they have retracted.

1095
01:37:48,717 --> 01:37:50,058
LIAM: They did.

1096
01:37:50,058 --> 01:37:51,729
TALIESIN: Where is everybody?

1097
01:37:51,729 --> 01:37:52,806
MARISHA: Yeah, are we all together?

1098
01:37:52,806 --> 01:37:54,455
MATT: You guys are all together, if you wanna be,
yeah.

1099
01:37:54,455 --> 01:37:55,781
LAURA: Can we be on the beach?

1100
01:37:55,781 --> 01:37:56,579
MARISHA: Ooh, yeah.

1101
01:37:56,579 --> 01:37:57,259
MATT: Sure!

1102
01:37:57,259 --> 01:37:57,919
TALIESIN: Yes.

1103
01:37:57,919 --> 01:37:58,867
SAM: Is there a beach?

1104
01:37:58,867 --> 01:38:02,920
MATT: Well, there are portions where the sand kind
of breaks the surface-- a lot of it is, you know,

1105
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:06,167
maybe a foot, foot and a half, below the water
before you start hitting the reef and the, you

1106
01:38:06,167 --> 01:38:11,334
know, the beach shelf drop off, but there are
places where the sand rises above, and there are

1107
01:38:11,334 --> 01:38:17,150
patches where you see a lot of the kids kind of
play around and leap off of, and there are beach

1108
01:38:17,150 --> 01:38:23,162
elements closer to the islands on the outskirts of
the city, between the actual islands themselves.

1109
01:38:23,162 --> 01:38:25,247
So yeah, there are beaches.

1110
01:38:25,247 --> 01:38:29,898
TALIESIN: I'm going to be crafting little seashell
necklaces or hair bits for everybody-- I've been

1111
01:38:29,898 --> 01:38:32,324
working on a hair bit.

1112
01:38:32,324 --> 01:38:33,398
LAURA: I like it.

1113
01:38:33,398 --> 01:38:34,569
TALIESIN: Mm. Little--

1114
01:38:34,569 --> 01:38:37,803
LAURA: Like a hair bit, or like a hair bit that
goes like this?

1115
01:38:37,803 --> 01:38:38,625
ASHLEY: Ooh.

1116
01:38:38,625 --> 01:38:39,456
TALIESIN: Yeah, and like the--

1117
01:38:39,456 --> 01:38:40,207
MARISHA: Oh, yeah yeah, yeah!

1118
01:38:40,207 --> 01:38:41,050
TALIESIN: -- with the little, yeah.

1119
01:38:41,050 --> 01:38:41,988
LAURA: Ooh! Yeah!

1120
01:38:41,988 --> 01:38:43,064
MARISHA: With a-- mm.

1121
01:38:43,064 --> 01:38:43,951
TALIESIN: You know what it-- yeah--

1122
01:38:43,951 --> 01:38:44,757
LAURA: I like it.

1123
01:38:44,757 --> 01:38:45,624
MATT: Yeah.

1124
01:38:45,624 --> 01:38:46,525
TALIESIN: It's like we've had this conversation.

1125
01:38:46,525 --> 01:38:47,618
LAURA: (laughs)

1126
01:38:47,618 --> 01:38:48,915
TALIESIN: Making little bits for everybody.

1127
01:38:48,915 --> 01:38:51,549
MATT: There you go. As you're working on that,
Vax, you do notice in this time that you see one

1128
01:38:51,549 --> 01:38:54,755
of your sister's feathers that's kind of carefully
braided into your hair.

1129
01:38:54,755 --> 01:38:57,530
LAURA: All of. I've only got two of 'em and
they're both in his hair.

1130
01:38:57,530 --> 01:39:02,309
MATT: There you go. Both of your sister's feathers
are braided into your hair.

1131
01:39:04,664 --> 01:39:09,542
MARISHA: I have something for you all. I have
presents.

1132
01:39:09,542 --> 01:39:11,616
TRAVIS: Presents?

1133
01:39:11,616 --> 01:39:12,777
MARISHA: Mm-hm.

1134
01:39:12,777 --> 01:39:14,159
LAURA: What for?

1135
01:39:14,159 --> 01:39:22,024
MARISHA: Well, I had Gilmore help me out with a
little something for if and when I completed the

1136
01:39:22,024 --> 01:39:30,785
Aramente, as a thank you, so I got them from him
before we left-- granted, in hindsight, I'm never

1137
01:39:30,785 --> 01:39:37,960
holding onto presents ever again, 'cause we could
all just die any day. But!

1138
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:38,927
LIAM: Like we do.

1139
01:39:38,927 --> 01:39:39,667
MARISHA: At least--

1140
01:39:39,667 --> 01:39:41,156
LAURA: Like you do.

1141
01:39:41,156 --> 01:39:50,355
MARISHA: Yeah, like you do. But this time it
worked out okay. And I pull out all the necklaces.

1142
01:39:50,663 --> 01:39:57,822
These are from the dragons we've collected.
They're dragon-tooth necklaces.

1143
01:39:57,822 --> 01:39:59,218
ALL: Ooh!

1144
01:39:59,218 --> 01:40:07,295
MARISHA: And I had Gilmore enchant a very simple
enchantment to each of them, so it won't-- you

1145
01:40:07,295 --> 01:40:09,526
won't have to focus or attune to it--

1146
01:40:09,526 --> 01:40:10,754
LAURA: Oh!

1147
01:40:10,754 --> 01:40:13,867
MARISHA: -- if any one of us goes unconscience--
unconscious.

1148
01:40:13,867 --> 01:40:15,286
LIAM: We're with you.

1149
01:40:15,286 --> 01:40:17,228
MARISHA: If any one of us goes unconscious--

1150
01:40:17,228 --> 01:40:18,357
LIAM: Don't sweat the details.

1151
01:40:18,357 --> 01:40:26,453
MARISHA: Thank you. The rest of them will start
beating a little heartbeat. That way, we know if

1152
01:40:26,453 --> 01:40:33,104
any one of us goes down, even if we can't see each
other. So. Grog!

1153
01:40:33,104 --> 01:40:34,530
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1154
01:40:34,530 --> 01:40:35,533
MARISHA: Pike!

1155
01:40:35,533 --> 01:40:36,786
ASHLEY: Thanks!

1156
01:40:36,786 --> 01:40:37,699
MARISHA: And Vex!

1157
01:40:37,699 --> 01:40:40,243
LAURA: It's wonderful, it's a little morbid and
wonderful at the same time.

1158
01:40:40,243 --> 01:40:41,202
ASHLEY: I love it.

1159
01:40:41,202 --> 01:40:42,048
MARISHA: Yeah. I know--

1160
01:40:42,048 --> 01:40:43,447
LIAM: Nah, it's fucking badass.

1161
01:40:43,447 --> 01:40:44,411
LAURA: That's so wonderful, Keyleth.

1162
01:40:44,411 --> 01:40:45,452
TRAVIS: It's nails.

1163
01:40:45,452 --> 01:40:47,231
MARISHA: Figure we all go unconscious so often--

1164
01:40:47,231 --> 01:40:48,194
LAURA: That's so thoughtful.

1165
01:40:48,194 --> 01:40:52,207
TRAVIS: Well, most of us do.

1166
01:40:52,207 --> 01:40:53,262
ASHLEY: Is that for--

1167
01:40:53,262 --> 01:40:55,511
MARISHA: Mm. Totally had this one made for
Scanlan.

1168
01:40:55,511 --> 01:40:56,573
TRAVIS: Mm. Just hold onto it.

1169
01:40:56,573 --> 01:40:57,525
TALIESIN: I say--

1170
01:40:57,525 --> 01:40:59,473
SAM: I understand, and that's fine. I--

1171
01:40:59,473 --> 01:41:02,655
MARISHA: Think I should hold onto it?

1172
01:41:02,655 --> 01:41:03,678
TRAVIS: Yeah, just hold onto it.

1173
01:41:03,678 --> 01:41:04,502
LIAM: Yeah.

1174
01:41:04,502 --> 01:41:05,453
TRAVIS: Don't give it to him.

1175
01:41:05,453 --> 01:41:06,504
LIAM: I mean, this is a--

1176
01:41:06,504 --> 01:41:08,632
MARISHA: But here's a flower! And I Druidcraft him
a flower.

1177
01:41:08,632 --> 01:41:09,571
SAM: Oh!

1178
01:41:09,571 --> 01:41:14,000
LAURA: What a bummer! Oh, I feel like somebody
that just got party invitations,

1179
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,699
it's like oh, I ran out!

1180
01:41:15,699 --> 01:41:19,692
TALIESIN: I make sure Tary gets a little seashell
crown. So.

1181
01:41:19,692 --> 01:41:20,434
MATT: Okay.

1182
01:41:20,434 --> 01:41:21,626
SAM: Thank you. This flower--

1183
01:41:21,626 --> 01:41:24,305
MARISHA: I mean, you can-- do you wanna wear it
for now?

1184
01:41:24,305 --> 01:41:25,624
TALIESIN: We do have to get him an earpiece.

1185
01:41:25,624 --> 01:41:29,836
MATT: As you're staring at the flower and
contemplating the awkwardness, you feel Percival

1186
01:41:29,836 --> 01:41:33,347
slowly come up behind you and just put a little
seashell crown on your head.

1187
01:41:33,347 --> 01:41:34,742
TALIESIN: Long may he reign.

1188
01:41:34,742 --> 01:41:37,284
(all laugh)

1189
01:41:37,338 --> 01:41:40,912
TRAVIS: Oh. My. God. Oh my god.

1190
01:41:41,289 --> 01:41:43,026
TALIESIN: Is there anyone else around, by the
way?

1191
01:41:43,026 --> 01:41:44,279
TRAVIS: Science bro vomit.

1192
01:41:44,279 --> 01:41:46,205
TALIESIN: I wanna check, are we being listened to?
Is there anyone within earshot? Is there

1193
01:41:46,205 --> 01:41:47,032
anything--

1194
01:41:47,032 --> 01:41:48,274
MATT: Make a perception check.

1195
01:41:48,274 --> 01:41:50,376
MARISHA: You know, maybe I should go ahead and
just give this to Tary, I can always have Gilmore

1196
01:41:50,376 --> 01:41:51,453
make another one.

1197
01:41:51,453 --> 01:41:52,293
TALIESIN: 16?

1198
01:41:52,293 --> 01:41:54,857
LAURA: You could always get it back from him if he
decides to leave our presence.

1199
01:41:54,857 --> 01:41:56,954
MATT: I mean, there are folks wandering around,
and there are some people that are kind of just

1200
01:41:56,954 --> 01:41:58,182
younger folk--

1201
01:41:58,182 --> 01:41:59,282
LAURA: It could be safe, if he's---

1202
01:41:59,282 --> 01:42:00,294
TALIESIN: Okay.

1203
01:42:00,294 --> 01:42:02,783
MATT: -- or people that are general denizens of
Vesrah that are just excited that all of a sudden

1204
01:42:02,783 --> 01:42:07,013
these people came in and apparently battled a
kraken and word has gotten around already--

1205
01:42:07,075 --> 01:42:08,493
LAURA: Just let him know it's to hold it.

1206
01:42:08,493 --> 01:42:09,536
MARISHA: Here, Tary.

1207
01:42:09,536 --> 01:42:10,506
SAM: What?

1208
01:42:10,506 --> 01:42:13,393
MARISHA: Just... you did good.

1209
01:42:13,393 --> 01:42:14,567
SAM: You're giving this to me?

1210
01:42:14,567 --> 01:42:16,337
MARISHA: You did good here today.

1211
01:42:16,337 --> 01:42:18,596
SAM: You're giving this to me.

1212
01:42:18,596 --> 01:42:20,687
MARISHA: At least for now. I can probably have
another made--

1213
01:42:20,687 --> 01:42:23,853
SAM: I drop to my knees. My lady,

1214
01:42:23,853 --> 01:42:24,741
TALIESIN: Oh.

1215
01:42:24,741 --> 01:42:25,798
MARISHA: Oh, jeez. Oh.

1216
01:42:25,798 --> 01:42:28,542
SAM: I cannot express to you what this means, to
be accepted as a full-fledged

1217
01:42:28,542 --> 01:42:30,055
member of this team, and--

1218
01:42:30,055 --> 01:42:33,303
(sounds of protest)

1219
01:42:33,303 --> 01:42:35,680
SAM: I knew this day would come, I didn't think so
soon, but--

1220
01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:37,149
TALIESIN: It has not come.

1221
01:42:37,149 --> 01:42:42,705
SAM: -- I suppose, finding that lodestone and
helping you on your 'acapakay'--

1222
01:42:42,705 --> 01:42:43,622
TALIESIN: Ooh.

1223
01:42:43,622 --> 01:42:46,190
LIAM: I lay down on the sand and just close my
eyes.

1224
01:42:46,190 --> 01:42:51,942
SAM: -- was enough to win over your good graces.
I've watched you in these last few battles, and

1225
01:42:51,995 --> 01:42:53,773
you have been powerful--

1226
01:42:53,773 --> 01:42:56,722
MARISHA: Okay-- thank you-- thank you.

1227
01:42:56,722 --> 01:42:57,951
SAM: I wasn't done.

1228
01:42:57,951 --> 01:42:59,519
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1229
01:42:59,519 --> 01:43:11,617
SAM: Powerful, confident, and enthralling, and I
vow to use this to the betterment of our entire

1230
01:43:11,617 --> 01:43:19,134
team, to make sure that none of us fall in battle,
not me, not Percy, not you, not either of the

1231
01:43:19,198 --> 01:43:22,180
elves, not short stuff or the big guy.

1232
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:26,268
ASHLEY: Ooh (laughs). Oh, you're so great.

1233
01:43:26,268 --> 01:43:27,518
MARISHA: Thank you.

1234
01:43:27,518 --> 01:43:28,594
LAURA: He doesn't know our names.

1235
01:43:28,594 --> 01:43:29,761
SAM: Thank you, so much.

1236
01:43:29,761 --> 01:43:30,919
ASHLEY: He doesn't know your names.

1237
01:43:30,919 --> 01:43:32,238
MARISHA: Thank you, thank you. That's--

1238
01:43:32,238 --> 01:43:33,214
TRAVIS: Look what you did.

1239
01:43:33,214 --> 01:43:34,444
SAM: I will cherish it always.

1240
01:43:34,444 --> 01:43:36,054
MARISHA: Yeah, all right, thank-- you're welcome.
Thank you.

1241
01:43:36,054 --> 01:43:39,327
LIAM: Keyleth, you have just passed the final
challenge of your Aramente.

1242
01:43:39,327 --> 01:43:40,609
MARISHA: I think you're right.

1243
01:43:40,609 --> 01:43:42,949
TALIESIN: I wonder--

1244
01:43:42,949 --> 01:43:44,689
MARISHA: I can't take it back from him now. Or
ever.

1245
01:43:44,689 --> 01:43:46,545
MATT: As you put it on, Doty's hand goes--

1246
01:43:46,545 --> 01:43:47,784
SAM: Oh.

1247
01:43:47,784 --> 01:43:48,950
LIAM: Grog will take it back.

1248
01:43:48,950 --> 01:43:50,009
SAM: Oh, he's sketching me?

1249
01:43:50,009 --> 01:43:51,102
MATT: Doty begins sketching you.

1250
01:43:51,102 --> 01:43:52,577
(all laugh)

1251
01:43:52,577 --> 01:43:56,995
SAM: No-- wait 'til I find the light, find the
light, find the light--

1252
01:43:56,995 --> 01:43:59,852
LAURA: Trinket goes up and pees on Doty's leg.

1253
01:43:59,852 --> 01:44:01,996
MATT: (lumbering bear noises)

1254
01:44:01,996 --> 01:44:04,758
LIAM: I'm imagining a really simple etch-a-sketch
drawing.

1255
01:44:04,758 --> 01:44:07,152
MATT: (sniffs, then pee sounds)

1256
01:44:07,152 --> 01:44:09,569
SAM: I don't want to move, I'll break the pose.

1257
01:44:09,569 --> 01:44:10,625
MATT: It's warm.

1258
01:44:10,625 --> 01:44:12,601
LAURA: Oh, Trinket, that's not a tree. That's a
robot.

1259
01:44:12,601 --> 01:44:13,654
MATT: (bear sounds)

1260
01:44:13,654 --> 01:44:14,606
LAURA: Yeah.

1261
01:44:14,606 --> 01:44:15,465
TALIESIN: Oh, dear.

1262
01:44:15,465 --> 01:44:16,486
LAURA: It'll come off. Don't worry.

1263
01:44:16,486 --> 01:44:20,745
MATT: Doty does not seem the least perturbed by
it.

1264
01:44:20,745 --> 01:44:30,825
TALIESIN: Uh.. Keyleth, I've been thinking. What
do you think the Aramente is supposed to teach?

1265
01:44:30,825 --> 01:44:33,393
MARISHA: I've been thinking about that a lot
myself.

1266
01:44:33,393 --> 01:44:39,710
TALIESIN: I'm regretting that I hadn't been
thinking about it until today.

1267
01:44:39,710 --> 01:44:46,152
MARISHA: Well, they don't really tell you much.
Just tell you to go back-- go out into the world

1268
01:44:46,152 --> 01:44:53,402
and prove yourself a leader, with no real
definition on what they think a leader should be.

1269
01:44:53,402 --> 01:44:58,084
TALIESIN: Well, they tell you to go out and gather
a group of friends, and then thrust yourself into

1270
01:44:58,084 --> 01:45:03,159
a death-defying situation that is likely to get
people killed.

1271
01:45:03,159 --> 01:45:08,302
MARISHA: That is one way you could phrase it,
yes.

1272
01:45:08,302 --> 01:45:18,478
TALIESIN: I'm-- and I don't mean to worry you--
just be cautious, I don't-- I have that nagging

1273
01:45:18,478 --> 01:45:25,958
feeling, and I'm hoping it's wrong, but I think it
is possible that they feel you did not lose-- you

1274
01:45:25,958 --> 01:45:29,221
did not learn the lesson of the Aramente.

1275
01:45:29,221 --> 01:45:32,849
MARISHA: Well, that'll be a discussion that I have
with Korren, with my father.

1276
01:45:32,849 --> 01:45:37,797
TALIESIN: What if the lesson is loss? What if
you're supposed to go down there and watch people

1277
01:45:37,797 --> 01:45:39,711
that you love die?

1278
01:45:39,711 --> 01:45:47,042
MARISHA: We're not barbaric! We're not-- no one
wants to lose anyone on an Aramente.

1279
01:45:47,042 --> 01:45:59,610
TALIESIN: The thing that defines the worst leader
a people could have is a lack of empathy.

1280
01:45:59,610 --> 01:46:01,500
MARISHA: Do you think I'm not empathetic?

1281
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:05,429
TALIESIN: I think that they make sure their
leaders might-- I think it's possible, I don't--

1282
01:46:05,429 --> 01:46:09,893
I'm nervous. I think it's possible that they make
sure their leaders are empathetic by making sure

1283
01:46:09,893 --> 01:46:11,539
they know pain.

1284
01:46:11,539 --> 01:46:17,405
MARISHA: Percy, do you not think that we have
experienced ample amount of pain and loss over the

1285
01:46:17,405 --> 01:46:18,692
course of this?

1286
01:46:18,692 --> 01:46:23,810
TALIESIN: I do, I just hope that it was enough-- I
just-- you know me.

1287
01:46:23,810 --> 01:46:33,220
MARISHA: It's not a blood sacrifice, it's a
tradition, it's meant to show us the world, and

1288
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:36,981
yes it's flawed and I want to fix that.

1289
01:46:36,981 --> 01:46:43,393
TALIESIN: This is beautiful here, and I-- I look
forward to leaving.

1290
01:46:43,393 --> 01:46:45,511
MARISHA: Ha.

1291
01:46:45,511 --> 01:46:53,799
TALIESIN: And I'm very proud of you, but I will be
on my guard, just in case.

1292
01:46:53,799 --> 01:47:00,281
MARISHA: I don't think my traditions really vary
that much from yours, which could still be

1293
01:47:00,281 --> 01:47:05,134
perceived as old-fashioned, if you will?

1294
01:47:05,134 --> 01:47:14,652
TALIESIN: Every farm boy in Whitestone, once he's
old enough to talk and work, names an animal,

1295
01:47:14,652 --> 01:47:18,431
raises it, and butchers it.

1296
01:47:18,431 --> 01:47:26,310
MARISHA: You know, it's interesting, Percy, I've
always looked at you and I as that

1297
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:34,757
opposites-attract conundrum. As my best friend, I
feel like you are always the natural born leader

1298
01:47:34,757 --> 01:47:44,226
who has been running away from it ever since I met
you, and I'm the one who's not as naturally

1299
01:47:44,226 --> 01:47:47,005
gifted, but is racing towards it faster than--

1300
01:47:47,005 --> 01:47:58,018
TALIESIN: I think I'm too cruel to lead. (sighs)
Regardless, speaking of which, oh boy. Grog.

1301
01:47:58,018 --> 01:47:59,487
TRAVIS: Yes?

1302
01:47:59,487 --> 01:48:12,020
TALIESIN: I have something to say. In a moment of
panic, I may have influenced your decision to save

1303
01:48:12,020 --> 01:48:17,539
Taryon from the kraken. I instantly regretted it--
not because of you, Taryon, I do apologise for

1304
01:48:17,539 --> 01:48:26,723
that-- I instantly regretted it. It was a poor
decision. I fully apologize, and if you wish to

1305
01:48:26,723 --> 01:48:34,651
keep my glasses, I totally understand, and at the
very least, if I have a swift punch in the face

1306
01:48:34,651 --> 01:48:40,291
coming, I completely understand. I'm so sorry. And
I wish I could say I would never do it again, but

1307
01:48:40,291 --> 01:48:44,411
I honestly don't trust myself that much. But I am
really, really sorry, and if anything had happened

1308
01:48:44,411 --> 01:48:48,635
I would have run in to save you as best I could.

1309
01:48:48,635 --> 01:48:51,847
TRAVIS: You look so, like, constipated right now.

1310
01:48:51,847 --> 01:48:53,585
TALIESIN: I think you're gonna punch me.

1311
01:48:53,585 --> 01:48:56,905
(all laugh)

1312
01:48:56,905 --> 01:48:59,612
TRAVIS: How did you influence my decision?

1313
01:48:59,612 --> 01:49:09,547
TALIESIN: It's-- I don't know, sometimes I can
just be unnaturally convincing.

1314
01:49:09,547 --> 01:49:12,476
TRAVIS: Is that a bad thing?

1315
01:49:12,476 --> 01:49:17,738
TALIESIN: In the wrong hands, which are my hands
on occasion. I felt bad. I feel bad. I feel like I

1316
01:49:17,738 --> 01:49:25,234
did-- I was not a good-- I feel like I made a poor
decision, and put you in peril, and subverted your

1317
01:49:25,234 --> 01:49:27,827
free will. Does that make-- Uh, no.

1318
01:49:27,827 --> 01:49:29,167
LAURA: (laughs)

1319
01:49:29,167 --> 01:49:30,758
TALIESIN: Small words.

1320
01:49:30,758 --> 01:49:34,234
MATT: You do, Grog, recall as you guys were
swimming up to Vesrah, and you were kind of

1321
01:49:34,234 --> 01:49:39,516
following up to the path, you thought, why did I
save Taryon?

1322
01:49:39,516 --> 01:49:41,604
TRAVIS: Yeah, why did I save Taryon?

1323
01:49:41,604 --> 01:49:45,172
TALIESIN: Because I'm a jerk. That's why you saved
Taryon, 'cause I'm--

1324
01:49:45,172 --> 01:49:47,876
because I can be a bad friend.

1325
01:49:47,876 --> 01:49:51,183
TRAVIS: Mm. What does that have to do with me?

1326
01:49:51,183 --> 01:49:57,236
TALIESIN: I just am trying to be honest with you,
because I respect you, and I would hate for you to

1327
01:49:57,236 --> 01:49:59,853
think that-- I-- (sighs) Terrible at this.

1328
01:49:59,853 --> 01:50:00,983
MARISHA: Are you all right, Percy?

1329
01:50:00,983 --> 01:50:04,961
TALIESIN: No, I'm not all right. I've made some
bad decisions today and I've terrible thoughts

1330
01:50:04,961 --> 01:50:07,347
and-- Ugh, I'm so tired.

1331
01:50:07,347 --> 01:50:08,561
TRAVIS: Tary?

1332
01:50:08,561 --> 01:50:10,266
SAM: Yes, sir?

1333
01:50:10,266 --> 01:50:12,270
TRAVIS: Are you glad you're alive?

1334
01:50:12,270 --> 01:50:14,313
SAM: Extremely.

1335
01:50:14,313 --> 01:50:16,891
TRAVIS: Well, there you go.

1336
01:50:16,891 --> 01:50:19,893
TALIESIN: How about we just say I owe you one?

1337
01:50:19,893 --> 01:50:20,951
TRAVIS: I owe you one?

1338
01:50:20,951 --> 01:50:22,014
TALIESIN: I owe you one.

1339
01:50:22,014 --> 01:50:23,369
TRAVIS: I thought you said I say I owe you one.

1340
01:50:23,369 --> 01:50:23,970
MARISHA: (laughs)

1341
01:50:23,970 --> 01:50:27,619
TALIESIN: No, well, you can say that, too, but
just know that-- that I owe you one.

1342
01:50:27,619 --> 01:50:28,635
I owe you-- what-- It's--

1343
01:50:28,635 --> 01:50:29,684
TRAVIS: How would that even work?

1344
01:50:29,684 --> 01:50:30,401
TALIESIN: That would work--

1345
01:50:30,401 --> 01:50:32,230
TRAVIS: We'd just be owing each other forever.

1346
01:50:32,230 --> 01:50:36,135
TALIESIN: I just-- Have some seashells... And a
skipping rock.

1347
01:50:36,135 --> 01:50:38,089
TRAVIS: Ooh!

1348
01:50:38,089 --> 01:50:40,006
(all laugh)

1349
01:50:40,006 --> 01:50:41,189
TALIESIN: I feel better. That's all I needed.

1350
01:50:41,189 --> 01:50:42,184
TRAVIS: I leave.

1351
01:50:42,184 --> 01:50:43,433
TALIESIN: That's all I needed, I feel better.

1352
01:50:43,433 --> 01:50:44,266
LAURA: Don't worry, Percy, he makes it--

1353
01:50:44,266 --> 01:50:46,270
MATT: (laughs) As Grog walks away with a skipping
rock--

1354
01:50:46,270 --> 01:50:47,497
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1355
01:50:47,497 --> 01:50:51,498
LIAM: Somewhere in the middle of all that serious
talk, I've pulled my sister off to the side and--

1356
01:50:51,498 --> 01:50:52,486
TRAVIS: (laughs) So good.

1357
01:50:52,486 --> 01:50:56,901
LIAM: -- have cajoled her into playing Airship.
You know, when, so-- we used to do this as kids--

1358
01:50:56,901 --> 01:50:57,995
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1359
01:50:57,995 --> 01:50:58,945
LIAM: -- I lay on my back--

1360
01:50:58,945 --> 01:50:59,746
LAURA: (gasps)

1361
01:50:59,746 --> 01:51:00,551
LIAM: -- and I lift her up in the air--

1362
01:51:00,551 --> 01:51:01,511
LAURA: Yeeeah!

1363
01:51:01,511 --> 01:51:02,369
LIAM: -- with my feet holding her up--

1364
01:51:02,369 --> 01:51:03,387
LAURA: I love this game!

1365
01:51:03,387 --> 01:51:04,446
LIAM: -- and I'm kind of in pain but I can kinda
do it.

1366
01:51:04,446 --> 01:51:05,370
MARISHA: (laughs)

1367
01:51:05,370 --> 01:51:06,490
LAURA: How do you even have strength for this
right now?

1368
01:51:06,490 --> 01:51:09,197
LIAM: (groans) I am ropy as fuck.

1369
01:51:09,197 --> 01:51:10,147
LAURA: (laughs)

1370
01:51:10,147 --> 01:51:12,735
LIAM: We are almost even now--

1371
01:51:12,735 --> 01:51:13,712
LAURA: In what?

1372
01:51:13,712 --> 01:51:15,662
LIAM: Well, we're twins, so, you've died, I've
died.

1373
01:51:15,662 --> 01:51:16,493
(all laugh)

1374
01:51:16,493 --> 01:51:18,358
LAURA: Oh, right! I thought you meant in size.

1375
01:51:18,358 --> 01:51:19,615
LIAM: No, no, no.

1376
01:51:19,615 --> 01:51:20,508
ASHLEY: (laughs)

1377
01:51:20,508 --> 01:51:22,094
LIAM: But you've died twice. So--

1378
01:51:22,094 --> 01:51:23,442
LAURA: Yes, I have.

1379
01:51:23,442 --> 01:51:25,332
LIAM: You are more ambitious than I am.

1380
01:51:25,332 --> 01:51:27,727
LAURA: (laughs) We've always known that.

1381
01:51:27,727 --> 01:51:31,403
LIAM: (laughs) Yeah. You know, we really need a
break.

1382
01:51:31,403 --> 01:51:33,347
LAURA: Yes, we do.

1383
01:51:33,347 --> 01:51:37,300
LIAM: I think we're going to hell soon,
literally-- But maybe after that, maybe we could

1384
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:38,715
take a break.

1385
01:51:38,715 --> 01:51:46,304
LAURA: I don't know if that's going to happen,
dear. I sort of made a promise to your queen.

1386
01:51:46,304 --> 01:51:50,496
Could you hear it on the other side?

1387
01:51:51,143 --> 01:51:56,279
LIAM: I don't remember anything.

1388
01:51:56,279 --> 01:52:03,386
LAURA: When we were trying to bring you back, I
kind of sort of-- And I come down off of his feet

1389
01:52:03,386 --> 01:52:04,459
(laughs) and stand up--

1390
01:52:04,459 --> 01:52:05,436
LIAM: (painful groaning)

1391
01:52:05,436 --> 01:52:10,546
LAURA: I kind of, sort of promised her we would
hunt down Orcus.

1392
01:52:10,546 --> 01:52:14,655
MATT: You do recall hearing those-- As she says
this, you remember now the various things that

1393
01:52:14,655 --> 01:52:20,965
were said, as the ritual's kinda coming to
clarity. And you realize the immensity of the

1394
01:52:20,965 --> 01:52:23,786
offer that was given.

1395
01:52:23,786 --> 01:52:29,247
LAURA: I mean, I was trying to get you back. I
know that is really hard and we probably are going

1396
01:52:29,247 --> 01:52:34,981
to have a very hard time finding Orcus and killing
him since he's like, you know, a god, I think--

1397
01:52:34,981 --> 01:52:36,189
TRAVIS: Ooh, ooh!

1398
01:52:36,189 --> 01:52:37,402
MARISHA: (laughs)

1399
01:52:37,402 --> 01:52:41,318
LAURA: Hey, you're here now! (snaps fingers) I'm
sorry.

1400
01:52:41,318 --> 01:52:44,312
LIAM: Hey, man, no judgment, it means you're just
like me.

1401
01:52:44,312 --> 01:52:49,403
LAURA: Yeah, right? Stupid decisions to bring the
people you love back to your side. Very stupid.

1402
01:52:49,403 --> 01:52:50,823
LIAM: What the fuck else are you gonna do?

1403
01:52:50,823 --> 01:52:54,403
LAURA: Stupid to be a champion, stupid to kill
Orcus, stupid all around.

1404
01:52:54,403 --> 01:52:55,764
LIAM: Did you give a timeline?

1405
01:52:55,764 --> 01:53:01,225
LAURA: No, no, no! I just kind of said we'd go and
do it. So, it could be, you know. Ah, I just said

1406
01:53:01,225 --> 01:53:02,770
we would do it.

1407
01:53:02,770 --> 01:53:14,119
LIAM: No, you know, in all seriousness, I have
been waiting for something. I don't know what. But

1408
01:53:14,119 --> 01:53:16,115
I'm not running towards it.

1409
01:53:16,115 --> 01:53:17,214
LAURA: (laughs)

1410
01:53:17,214 --> 01:53:18,568
LIAM: I think we'll get there.

1411
01:53:18,568 --> 01:53:25,085
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah. I have a feeling she pulls our
fate strings anyway.

1412
01:53:25,085 --> 01:53:26,894
She'll make sure we get there.

1413
01:53:26,894 --> 01:53:28,432
LIAM: (sighs)

1414
01:53:28,432 --> 01:53:35,520
LAURA: Mine's connected to yours. Wherever you go,
I go. Unless it's, you know--

1415
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:36,741
LIAM: I start to cry a little bit.

1416
01:53:36,741 --> 01:53:44,090
LAURA: (laughs) Aw! I'm glad you're back.

1417
01:53:44,090 --> 01:53:48,945
LIAM: I don't say anything.

1418
01:53:48,945 --> 01:53:51,930
MATT: You hear what sounds like a whip crack of
thunder.

1419
01:53:51,930 --> 01:53:53,001
SAM: (gasps)

1420
01:53:53,001 --> 01:53:55,839
MATT: As you glance over your shoulder and watch
as Grog with the Titanstone Knuckles

1421
01:53:55,839 --> 01:53:58,183
skips a stone so hard--

1422
01:53:58,183 --> 01:53:59,151
(all laugh)

1423
01:53:59,151 --> 01:54:03,552
MATT: -- that it shatters into multiple pieces upon
making contact with the water.

1424
01:54:03,552 --> 01:54:05,336
ASHLEY: (claps) Grog!

1425
01:54:05,336 --> 01:54:06,565
LAURA: (claps) Grog!

1426
01:54:06,565 --> 01:54:08,200
TALIESIN: (slow claps) I can die happy now that I
saw that.

1427
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:08,972
LAURA: That was amazing!

1428
01:54:08,972 --> 01:54:09,746
ASHLEY: That was cool!

1429
01:54:09,746 --> 01:54:10,809
MARISHA: That was awesome!

1430
01:54:10,809 --> 01:54:11,926
TRAVIS: Is that a record?

1431
01:54:11,926 --> 01:54:12,823
MARISHA: Yeah!

1432
01:54:12,823 --> 01:54:13,670
TALIESIN: It may be.

1433
01:54:13,670 --> 01:54:14,421
ASHLEY: Probably.

1434
01:54:14,421 --> 01:54:15,138
TRAVIS: Wow.

1435
01:54:15,138 --> 01:54:16,425
LAURA: I write ten on a sheet of paper and hold it
up.

1436
01:54:16,425 --> 01:54:17,339
(all laugh)

1437
01:54:17,339 --> 01:54:18,335
TRAVIS: Where'd you get that paper from?

1438
01:54:18,335 --> 01:54:19,185
LAURA: I have it in my bag.

1439
01:54:19,185 --> 01:54:20,002
ASHLEY: (laughs)

1440
01:54:20,002 --> 01:54:20,656
TARVIS: That's amazing.

1441
01:54:20,656 --> 01:54:21,303
LAURA: I know.

1442
01:54:21,303 --> 01:54:22,386
LIAM: I think you just hit Whitestone.

1443
01:54:22,386 --> 01:54:23,303
(all laugh)

1444
01:54:23,303 --> 01:54:26,447
TALIESIN: I'm showing Pike the jewelry I'm
bringing back. So, since I can't give it to you

1445
01:54:26,447 --> 01:54:27,894
now, I'm just modeling it.

1446
01:54:27,894 --> 01:54:28,653
ASHLEY: Oh, it's--

1447
01:54:28,653 --> 01:54:30,539
TALIESIN: It's a little hand thing, it's got some
tie things.

1448
01:54:30,539 --> 01:54:34,743
ASHLEY: (gasps) Percy, it's beautiful! I want it
now.

1449
01:54:34,743 --> 01:54:37,048
TALIESIN: I don't know if that will go well.

1450
01:54:37,048 --> 01:54:38,086
LAURA: It will fall off of your form.

1451
01:54:38,086 --> 01:54:39,089
TALIESIN: Patience!

1452
01:54:39,089 --> 01:54:41,214
LIAM: Does it sink through-- slowly through the
Jello?

1453
01:54:41,214 --> 01:54:42,115
TALIESIN: I'll clean it off.

1454
01:54:42,115 --> 01:54:43,563
(all laugh)

1455
01:54:43,563 --> 01:54:51,315
MATT: As the afternoon comes to a close and the
sun slowly sets on the distant ocean horizon,

1456
01:54:51,360 --> 01:55:00,989
the lights begin to brighten anew to usher in the
eveningscape of Vesrah. A similar gathering of

1457
01:55:00,989 --> 01:55:06,724
the people of Vesrah that you celebrated with the
evening before comes to life, even more vibrant

1458
01:55:06,876 --> 01:55:16,421
and excited at the tale of an Aramente completed.
As this is transpiring, you guys are brought in,

1459
01:55:16,421 --> 01:55:18,376
food is prepared--

1460
01:55:18,376 --> 01:55:20,185
MARISHA: I'm in my fancy clothes, by the way.

1461
01:55:20,185 --> 01:55:25,199
MATT: Okay, yeah, fair enough. You guys-- wherever
you can, as you guys--

1462
01:55:25,199 --> 01:55:26,960
LAURA: Ooh, seashell bras.

1463
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:28,109
LIAM: I'm in the Deathwalker's Ward.

1464
01:55:28,109 --> 01:55:30,803
(all laugh)

1465
01:55:30,803 --> 01:55:32,101
LAURA: With salt crusted on it.

1466
01:55:32,101 --> 01:55:35,334
MARISHA: Yeah, it's still a little soggy and
damp.

1467
01:55:35,334 --> 01:55:40,230
MATT: As you guys are getting ready and brought
into this, and people are beginning to come up and

1468
01:55:40,230 --> 01:55:47,396
congratulate you, bringing their kids up to shake
the hands of the future Voice of the Tempest, you

1469
01:55:47,396 --> 01:55:52,532
watch as a group of figures appears on the
outskirts of the light in this central meeting

1470
01:55:52,532 --> 01:55:57,209
area. You glance over and watch as all of a sudden
the nervousness kicks in, and everyone turns and

1471
01:55:57,209 --> 01:56:03,566
looks, as there, dipping into the light, you see
Captain Adella and the crew going, "Okay, so we've

1472
01:56:03,566 --> 01:56:07,965
"been waiting for quite a while and it looks like
you're having a party without us.

1473
01:56:07,965 --> 01:56:11,245
"So. Mind if we join in?"

1474
01:56:11,245 --> 01:56:13,455
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, come on!

1475
01:56:13,455 --> 01:56:14,428
MATT: "Told you!"

1476
01:56:14,428 --> 01:56:15,172
TALIESIN: Pour.

1477
01:56:15,172 --> 01:56:16,110
MARISHA: Toss a drink, yeah.

1478
01:56:16,110 --> 01:56:19,471
MATT: And the rest of the crew comes in, of the
Drensala Vis.

1479
01:56:19,471 --> 01:56:22,811
LAURA: What about the prisoner? Is he still on
board?

1480
01:56:22,811 --> 01:56:26,358
MATT: "Oh yeah, no, we're leaving that fucker on
the ship. We're not taking him here."

1481
01:56:26,358 --> 01:56:29,365
LAURA: All right.

1482
01:56:29,365 --> 01:56:33,317
MATT: "So. Everything went fine, I suppose?"

1483
01:56:33,317 --> 01:56:34,416
LIAM: Peachy-peachy.

1484
01:56:34,416 --> 01:56:35,396
MATT: "Great."

1485
01:56:35,396 --> 01:56:36,235
MARISHA: Right as rain.

1486
01:56:36,235 --> 01:56:37,572
MATT: "Fantastic. Going back soon, then, huh?

1487
01:56:37,572 --> 01:56:40,384
ALL: Yes.

1488
01:56:40,384 --> 01:56:43,208
MATT: "Great, first light of the morning, let's
get back."

1489
01:56:43,208 --> 01:56:44,900
TRAVIS: Are you in a rush?

1490
01:56:44,900 --> 01:56:51,496
MATT: "No, but the longer we're here, the more
time we spend out wandering amongst the reef with

1491
01:56:51,496 --> 01:57:04,708
"these people." And she glances around, and as you
look around, you do see a very comparably bohemian

1492
01:57:04,708 --> 01:57:07,916
lifestyle of the water ashari.

1493
01:57:07,916 --> 01:57:09,525
LIAM: Eyes Wide Shut?

1494
01:57:09,525 --> 01:57:11,098
MATT: Not quite that level.

1495
01:57:11,098 --> 01:57:13,578
MARISHA: What's your definition of bohemian?

1496
01:57:13,578 --> 01:57:14,570
MATT: Yeah!

1497
01:57:14,570 --> 01:57:15,348
LIAM: Eyes Wide Shut.

1498
01:57:15,348 --> 01:57:17,676
(all laugh)

1499
01:57:17,676 --> 01:57:19,577
MATT: I'm so glad you don't live in Los Villas.

1500
01:57:19,577 --> 01:57:22,397
SAM: Like Venice people? Like beachy hippies.

1501
01:57:22,397 --> 01:57:25,072
MATT: Yeah, it's very Venice Beach.

1502
01:57:25,072 --> 01:57:29,766
TALIESIN: Like Labyrinth muppets, maybe. Like the
creepy head Labyrinth muppets.

1503
01:57:29,766 --> 01:57:31,155
LIAM: Everybody looks like the Raven Queen.

1504
01:57:31,155 --> 01:57:33,322
(all laugh)

1505
01:57:33,322 --> 01:57:45,083
MATT: But yeah. Drinks are had, the party
celebrates, and then eventually Uvenda begins to

1506
01:57:45,083 --> 01:57:49,562
approach, and everyone gets quiet, and she walks
up towards you, Keyleth, and reaches out to take

1507
01:57:49,562 --> 01:58:02,065
your hand, both of your hands in hers. "In
completing the trial of the water ashari, I impart

1508
01:58:02,065 --> 01:58:14,265
"unto you now a gift. Something I, as far as I
understand, have only been around long enough to

1509
01:58:14,265 --> 01:58:20,706
"learn. But seeing the strength that you hold,
perhaps you can wield this as well."

1510
01:58:21,561 --> 01:58:22,620
MARISHA: Okay?

1511
01:58:22,620 --> 01:58:27,055
MATT: As she takes your hands, she folds them over
each other, and she encloses them in her tiny

1512
01:58:27,055 --> 01:58:38,243
gnomish grasp. "Close your eyes." As you close
your eyes, and you can hear the hush of people

1513
01:58:38,243 --> 01:58:50,832
silencing each other around. "Now, the form of one
who protects the elements is malleable. You can

1514
01:58:50,832 --> 01:59:02,263
"transcend this particular form and become the
beasts of nature. You can become the creatures of

1515
01:59:02,308 --> 01:59:12,177
"the elements that we safeguard. However, those
who've mastered the journey that you have? They

1516
01:59:12,177 --> 01:59:19,646
"can become so much more. Now walk with me." And
she tugs on your hand. "Keep your eyes closed, but

1517
01:59:19,646 --> 01:59:25,947
"walk with me." And you guys watch as she backs up
and leads Keyleth out of the pavilion, out into

1518
01:59:25,947 --> 01:59:34,073
the darkness in the center of the main
thoroughfare of Vesrah. The crowd wanders along,

1519
01:59:34,073 --> 01:59:40,401
if you guys want to shuffle with. She leads
Keyleth out, eyes still closed, and as soon as

1520
01:59:40,401 --> 01:59:44,131
people start crowding in, she goes, (huff of
breath), and the guards hold people back and leave a

1521
01:59:44,131 --> 01:59:54,897
wide berth around. "Now. Keyleth. You've
encountered many beasts, many dangerous and

1522
01:59:54,957 --> 02:00:03,042
"powerful creatures from all walks of the planes.
Pick one."

1523
02:00:03,042 --> 02:00:05,513
SAM: (gasps)

1524
02:00:06,114 --> 02:00:08,472
MATT: "What do you see in your mind?"

1525
02:00:10,911 --> 02:00:14,306
MARISHA: I think of the goristro, Yenk.

1526
02:00:15,530 --> 02:00:25,164
MATT: "Imagine what it's like to be filled with
strength, to be filled with the power. Envision

1527
02:00:25,164 --> 02:00:33,252
"the horns, the snarl, the barrel-like fists." And
you guys watch as Keyleth's form suddenly begins

1528
02:00:33,252 --> 02:00:40,204
to shift and grow and where once was a half-elf
Keyleth, you now see, towering above this tiny

1529
02:00:40,204 --> 02:00:44,025
gnome, eyes still closed, a massive goristro.

1530
02:00:44,025 --> 02:00:46,034
TRAVIS: No fucking way.

1531
02:00:46,034 --> 02:00:47,730
TALIESIN: Oh, well, that's disconcerting.

1532
02:00:47,730 --> 02:00:55,362
MATT: Everyone goes (gasps) and as her hands leave
yours, you feel something shift and change and you

1533
02:00:55,423 --> 02:01:02,002
hear the slightly more distant voice of Uvenda
say, "Now open your eyes." And you look down--

1534
02:01:02,002 --> 02:01:03,271
MARISHA: (screams)

1535
02:01:03,271 --> 02:01:04,785
MATT: (laughs)

1536
02:01:04,785 --> 02:01:06,276
TALIESIN: That's less disconcerting.

1537
02:01:06,276 --> 02:01:07,832
LAURA: Is she stuck like that?

1538
02:01:07,832 --> 02:01:10,210
MATT: "No, no, she's fine. This is under her
control."

1539
02:01:10,210 --> 02:01:11,720
LAURA: Okay.

1540
02:01:11,720 --> 02:01:13,113
LIAM: She's fine.

1541
02:01:13,113 --> 02:01:21,817
MATT: "This incantation is yours now. Be what you
wish. Use these creatures."

1542
02:01:21,817 --> 02:01:23,690
MARISHA: I turn into a beholder.

1543
02:01:23,690 --> 02:01:24,819
MATT: (swoosh) You watch as all her body--

1544
02:01:24,819 --> 02:01:26,029
TRAVIS: Shut the fuck up.

1545
02:01:26,029 --> 02:01:26,957
MATT: -- shifts and becomes--

1546
02:01:26,957 --> 02:01:28,092
TRAVIS: Shut up.

1547
02:01:28,092 --> 02:01:31,282
MATT: -- a meaty mass with a singular eye and many
eyestalks and you watch as everyone takes two

1548
02:01:31,333 --> 02:01:33,099
steps back (gasps)--

1549
02:01:33,099 --> 02:01:34,499
TRAVIS: You can not do that now!

1550
02:01:34,499 --> 02:01:35,991
LAURA: What is this?! What is this?!

1551
02:01:35,991 --> 02:01:37,202
What the fuck?!

1552
02:01:37,202 --> 02:01:39,788
TRAVIS: Are you serious?!

1553
02:01:39,858 --> 02:01:40,820
MARISHA: (laughs)

1554
02:01:40,820 --> 02:01:41,781
LAURA: What is this?!

1555
02:01:41,781 --> 02:01:42,803
MARISHA: I am a golden god!

1556
02:01:42,803 --> 02:01:44,180
(all laugh)

1557
02:01:44,180 --> 02:01:46,124
MATT: "Your shape is yours to change, Keyleth."

1558
02:01:46,124 --> 02:01:55,055
MARISHA: I change into-- adult bronze dragon.

1559
02:01:55,055 --> 02:01:58,789
MATT: You watch as the beholder that's looking
around excitedly suddenly shifts and grows two

1560
02:01:58,789 --> 02:02:01,073
large bronze wings--

1561
02:02:01,073 --> 02:02:02,068
ASHLEY: (laughs)

1562
02:02:02,068 --> 02:02:04,461
MATT: -- claws emerge and the head extends.

1563
02:02:04,461 --> 02:02:05,927
TALIESIN: Oh dear.

1564
02:02:05,927 --> 02:02:08,082
LIAM: That is really hot.

1565
02:02:08,082 --> 02:02:10,158
LAURA: But like, that's really big. How?

1566
02:02:10,158 --> 02:02:11,740
MARISHA: I do a victory lap (whoosh).

1567
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:12,758
MATT: (whoosh whoosh)

1568
02:02:12,758 --> 02:02:15,090
LAURA: How is this possible?

1569
02:02:15,090 --> 02:02:16,222
TRAVIS: Can she do the stuff they do?

1570
02:02:16,222 --> 02:02:20,020
LAURA: Is she like a dragon for real? Does
anybody--?

1571
02:02:20,020 --> 02:02:22,968
MATT: Uvenda turns to you as you're shouting this,
everyone's kinda watching her fly over, you can

1572
02:02:22,968 --> 02:02:27,829
see the little bit of light that glows from the
city occasionally reflect off the metallic

1573
02:02:27,829 --> 02:02:34,133
underbody of the dragon as it circles overhead in
the dark night sky. Uvenda turns to you and goes,

1574
02:02:34,133 --> 02:02:39,470
"Ah yes. Don't worry. These forms are hers to
control."

1575
02:02:39,470 --> 02:02:43,644
MARISHA: I turn and-- brass dragons have fire
breath, right? Do they have fire breath?

1576
02:02:43,644 --> 02:02:45,000
MATT: I'm pretty sure.

1577
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:45,805
LAURA: No.

1578
02:02:45,805 --> 02:02:46,902
TALIESIN: Very frightening.

1579
02:02:46,902 --> 02:02:49,297
MARISHA: I do-- into the air, I just go (kwoosh)

1580
02:02:49,297 --> 02:02:51,462
MATT: I'm gonna look this up real fast so the
internet doesn't hate me.

1581
02:02:51,462 --> 02:02:52,498
MARISHA: See what happens.

1582
02:02:52,498 --> 02:02:53,737
TRAVIS: You kill everyone on the ground.

1583
02:02:53,737 --> 02:02:56,324
(all laugh)

1584
02:02:56,324 --> 02:03:07,043
MATT: Yeah, it is fire breath. So you watch as she
flies off, she shoots forth this burning hot,

1585
02:03:07,043 --> 02:03:16,103
bright jet of singular focused fire, not a
napalm-level red dragon cone breath, but a

1586
02:03:16,103 --> 02:03:22,691
singular focused beam of burning fire that just
lights up all of Vesrah around. You see the

1587
02:03:22,691 --> 02:03:29,246
hundreds of the denizens around go, "Oh!" as their
faces glow against the dark sky around you.

1588
02:03:29,523 --> 02:03:32,967
LAURA: I feel far less nervous about this Orcus
thing now.

1589
02:03:32,967 --> 02:03:33,965
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1590
02:03:33,965 --> 02:03:35,019
LIAM: What was that?

1591
02:03:35,019 --> 02:03:36,268
LAURA: Ha. (laughs)

1592
02:03:36,268 --> 02:03:37,525
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Wow.

1593
02:03:37,525 --> 02:03:39,683
LAURA: That's insane.

1594
02:03:40,087 --> 02:03:43,356
MATT: Uvenda's just looking up and smiling,
clasping her hands together.

1595
02:03:43,404 --> 02:03:45,792
TRAVIS: Who needs a fucking magic carpet now?

1596
02:03:45,792 --> 02:03:47,198
MARISHA: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!

1597
02:03:47,198 --> 02:03:48,427
TRAVIS: We got a jumbo jet.

1598
02:03:48,427 --> 02:03:50,869
MARISHA: I come back down and I come down and I'm
like (animal noises).

1599
02:03:50,869 --> 02:03:52,809
LAURA: Can't you talk as a dragon? Can't dragons
talk?

1600
02:03:52,809 --> 02:03:53,673
MARISHA: Oh, that's right.

1601
02:03:53,673 --> 02:03:54,709
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1602
02:03:54,709 --> 02:03:55,790
MARISHA: I'm so used to Beast Shape!

1603
02:03:55,790 --> 02:03:56,695
(all laugh)

1604
02:03:56,695 --> 02:03:57,800
MARISHA: I'm so used to not being able to fucking
talk!

1605
02:03:57,800 --> 02:03:59,205
LIAM: She's gesturing and I'm already climbing on.

1606
02:03:59,205 --> 02:04:02,659
TRAVIS: (animal noises) Oh she can change into a
dragon but she's-- yeah.

1607
02:04:02,659 --> 02:04:05,742
ASHLEY: If I touch her, does she feel like a
dragon?

1608
02:04:05,742 --> 02:04:09,644
MATT: Yeah. You feel the hard scales across her
hide.

1609
02:04:09,644 --> 02:04:10,702
MARISHA: So I can talk?

1610
02:04:10,702 --> 02:04:11,493
MATT: Yeah.

1611
02:04:11,493 --> 02:04:14,076
MARISHA: Hey guys! Guys, check it out! Ah, Ah.

1612
02:04:14,076 --> 02:04:16,883
LAURA: I like the idea that it's just like your
regular-ass voice coming out of--

1613
02:04:16,883 --> 02:04:19,458
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm like, ah guys! Got little
antlers.

1614
02:04:19,458 --> 02:04:25,414
TALIESIN: This went so FernGully so quickly.

1615
02:04:25,414 --> 02:04:30,186
MATT: Yeah. It's Keyleth's voice but it's deeper,
it's resonating, it quakes the sand on the ground

1616
02:04:30,186 --> 02:04:31,969
near her when she speaks.

1617
02:04:31,969 --> 02:04:34,690
TRAVIS: (deep voice) Hey guys.

1618
02:04:34,690 --> 02:04:35,639
LAURA: What the fuck. What is this?

1619
02:04:35,639 --> 02:04:36,892
TRAVIS: (deep voice) It's me, Keyleth.

1620
02:04:36,892 --> 02:04:37,700
LAURA: Like, this is amazing, Keyleth.

1621
02:04:37,700 --> 02:04:39,358
MARISHA: This is-- I don't know.

1622
02:04:39,358 --> 02:04:40,519
SAM: (whispering) She's amazing.

1623
02:04:40,519 --> 02:04:42,336
LAURA: We should have completed your Aramente a
lot sooner.

1624
02:04:42,336 --> 02:04:43,614
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1625
02:04:43,614 --> 02:04:46,739
MARISHA: You wanna go for a ride?

1626
02:04:46,739 --> 02:04:48,819
TRAVIS: (deep voice) I'm so happy right now.

1627
02:04:48,819 --> 02:04:49,623
LAURA: Yes!

1628
02:04:49,623 --> 02:04:50,319
ASHLEY: Yeah!

1629
02:04:50,319 --> 02:04:51,622
MARISHA: Okay, all right. I pick up the
half-elves.

1630
02:04:51,622 --> 02:04:52,381
LAURA: And Pike!

1631
02:04:52,381 --> 02:04:53,111
TRAVIS: Hey, hey!

1632
02:04:53,111 --> 02:04:53,875
LAURA: Pike wanted to go too.

1633
02:04:53,875 --> 02:04:54,545
MARISHA: And Pike!

1634
02:04:54,545 --> 02:04:55,251
ASHLEY: I did want to go. I want to go.

1635
02:04:55,251 --> 02:04:56,138
LIAM: Don't let the jello fall apart.

1636
02:04:56,138 --> 02:04:56,952
TALIESIN: There's always room for jello.

1637
02:04:56,952 --> 02:04:58,111
ASHLEY: It's fine if I fall apart. It happens.

1638
02:04:58,111 --> 02:05:03,469
MATT: Okay, as the tinier folks step onto the back
of Keyleth-dragon, they take off into the sky. You

1639
02:05:03,469 --> 02:05:06,349
watch as a bunch of the children now begin to try
and line up now.

1640
02:05:06,349 --> 02:05:07,303
ALL: Aw.

1641
02:05:07,303 --> 02:05:09,514
MATT: And the parents are like, mm-hm.

1642
02:05:09,514 --> 02:05:10,782
MARISHA: Yes.

1643
02:05:10,782 --> 02:05:12,741
TRAVIS: I am clearly moving ahead of them to the
front of the fucking line.

1644
02:05:12,741 --> 02:05:13,659
(all laugh)

1645
02:05:13,659 --> 02:05:15,117
MATT: As Grog forces himself to the front of the
line--

1646
02:05:15,117 --> 02:05:16,290
ASHLEY: I was here first.

1647
02:05:16,290 --> 02:05:20,049
MATT: -- like palms a child and just pushes it
back, like Old School, just (pff) out of the way.

1648
02:05:20,049 --> 02:05:20,921
TRAVIS: Yep.

1649
02:05:20,921 --> 02:05:24,491
MARISHA: And I totally spend the next hour giving
joy-rides to anyone who wants to.

1650
02:05:24,491 --> 02:05:27,992
MATT: And yeah, most of the folks of Vesrah begin
to start giving in to it--

1651
02:05:27,992 --> 02:05:28,853
MARISHA: Dragon rides.

1652
02:05:28,853 --> 02:05:29,747
LAURA: Wow.

1653
02:05:29,747 --> 02:05:32,070
MATT: -- taking dragon rides from Keyleth over the
night sky (laughs).

1654
02:05:32,070 --> 02:05:33,951
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Wow.

1655
02:05:33,951 --> 02:05:37,267
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

1656
02:05:37,267 --> 02:05:38,351
MARISHA: I leveled up.

1657
02:05:38,351 --> 02:05:39,357
LAURA: That's pretty fucking sick.

1658
02:05:39,357 --> 02:05:41,503
MATT: Yeah, and in fact, I'll go look at the
logistics of this, but after that kraken battle,

1659
02:05:41,503 --> 02:05:43,356
most everybody leveled up on that.

1660
02:05:43,356 --> 02:05:44,737
LAURA: Yeah!

1661
02:05:44,737 --> 02:05:46,892
MATT: I'll send that out tonight via email to you
guys.

1662
02:05:46,892 --> 02:05:47,685
TALIESIN: Oh god.

1663
02:05:47,685 --> 02:05:48,528
LAURA: Sweet!

1664
02:05:48,528 --> 02:05:49,522
MARISHA: So that's Shapechange, right?

1665
02:05:49,522 --> 02:05:52,363
MATT: You have Shapechange as one of a possible
9th-level spell.

1666
02:05:52,363 --> 02:05:53,763
SAM: What is Shapechange?

1667
02:05:53,763 --> 02:05:54,541
LIAM: That!

1668
02:05:54,541 --> 02:05:55,333
SAM: You can just become anything?

1669
02:05:55,333 --> 02:05:56,465
LAURA: It's a ninth-level spell.

1670
02:05:56,465 --> 02:06:00,211
MARISHA: I can change into anything that's a
challenge rating of my level or lower.

1671
02:06:00,211 --> 02:06:01,139
SAM: Once?

1672
02:06:01,139 --> 02:06:01,840
LAURA: Wait.

1673
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:02,704
SAM: Or constantly?

1674
02:06:02,704 --> 02:06:03,491
MARISHA: For an hour.

1675
02:06:03,491 --> 02:06:04,657
LAURA: Dragons are your level?

1676
02:06:04,657 --> 02:06:05,739
MARISHA: Adult dragons are.

1677
02:06:05,739 --> 02:06:06,775
MATT: An adult one. Not an ancient.

1678
02:06:06,775 --> 02:06:07,675
LAURA: Okay.

1679
02:06:07,675 --> 02:06:08,377
MARISHA: Yeah.

1680
02:06:08,377 --> 02:06:09,110
SAM: Wow.

1681
02:06:09,110 --> 02:06:11,757
LAURA: Wow, still, adult dragon is like, right on
par.

1682
02:06:11,757 --> 02:06:12,597
MATT: It's not bad.

1683
02:06:12,597 --> 02:06:14,288
LIAM: Guys, we've been playing this campaign for a
while.

1684
02:06:14,288 --> 02:06:16,238
(all laugh)

1685
02:06:16,238 --> 02:06:17,338
TRAVIS: This is amazing.

1686
02:06:17,338 --> 02:06:19,089
MARISHA: (sighs) I wasn't sure if I was ever gonna
get here.

1687
02:06:19,089 --> 02:06:20,219
TRAVIS: Fucking amazing.

1688
02:06:20,219 --> 02:06:25,725
MARISHA: (heavy sigh) Yeah I can. It's for an hour
and I can keep shapechanging into different things

1689
02:06:25,725 --> 02:06:26,519
for an hour.

1690
02:06:26,519 --> 02:06:28,150
TRAVIS: You can whip those beholder eyes at
people?

1691
02:06:28,150 --> 02:06:29,007
MARISHA: Yes, I can.

1692
02:06:29,007 --> 02:06:29,966
LAURA: Oh my god.

1693
02:06:29,966 --> 02:06:30,878
LIAM: Holy shit.

1694
02:06:30,878 --> 02:06:31,823
SAM: Wow.

1695
02:06:31,823 --> 02:06:33,119
LAURA: And you can do all the things that they can
do?

1696
02:06:33,119 --> 02:06:34,780
TRAVIS: Is it at will or is it a random roll for
which eye does what?

1697
02:06:34,780 --> 02:06:39,916
MARISHA: It's like Beast Shape, so I keep my
intellect, my wisdom, and my charisma, but I take

1698
02:06:39,916 --> 02:06:41,456
on their physical stats--

1699
02:06:41,456 --> 02:06:42,170
LAURA: Ah!

1700
02:06:42,170 --> 02:06:43,393
MARISHA: -- and their abilities.

1701
02:06:43,393 --> 02:06:44,431
ASHLEY: You're a beast.

1702
02:06:44,431 --> 02:06:47,221
TRAVIS: And same thing, like you drop the shape's
hit points and then it reverts back to you.

1703
02:06:47,221 --> 02:06:47,979
MARISHA: Yep.

1704
02:06:47,979 --> 02:06:48,935
MATT: You don't get legendary actions--

1705
02:06:48,935 --> 02:06:49,799
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1706
02:06:49,799 --> 02:06:50,646
MARISHA: I know!

1707
02:06:50,646 --> 02:06:51,715
MATT: -- or lair actions but you get all the rest
of the abilities

1708
02:06:51,715 --> 02:06:53,219
and physical attributes of the creature.

1709
02:06:53,219 --> 02:06:54,080
SAM: Wow.

1710
02:06:54,080 --> 02:06:55,057
LAURA: I'd say that's pretty fucking sick.

1711
02:06:55,057 --> 02:06:55,945
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

1712
02:06:55,945 --> 02:06:57,858
LIAM: Forget about strawberry, how about
raw-berry!

1713
02:06:57,858 --> 02:07:00,644
(all laugh)

1714
02:07:00,644 --> 02:07:01,963
LAURA: Ah man.

1715
02:07:01,963 --> 02:07:03,504
TALIESIN: Juice Springsteen.

1716
02:07:03,504 --> 02:07:04,386
ASHLEY: Holy cow.

1717
02:07:04,386 --> 02:07:08,878
MATT: So eventually, as you feel the spell begin
to dissipate, the shapechange coming to an end,

1718
02:07:08,878 --> 02:07:13,478
you bring the last cluster of children and Grog,
who has ridden now seven times.

1719
02:07:13,478 --> 02:07:15,889
(all laugh)

1720
02:07:15,889 --> 02:07:17,517
LIAM: (deep voice) Whee!

1721
02:07:17,517 --> 02:07:18,999
TRAVIS: Ah!

1722
02:07:18,999 --> 02:07:23,155
MATT: As the night draws to a close--

1723
02:07:23,155 --> 02:07:28,612
MARISHA: As the spell fades, I just give Grog a
big hug and just kinda cry tears of joy into his

1724
02:07:28,612 --> 02:07:29,752
chest for a little bit.

1725
02:07:29,752 --> 02:07:31,120
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1726
02:07:31,120 --> 02:07:35,747
MATT: And yeah, reverting back to your form, the
party comes to an end. Uvenda comes up to you as

1727
02:07:35,747 --> 02:07:40,002
you come back to your form and says, "I'm proud of
you."

1728
02:07:40,002 --> 02:07:41,911
MARISHA: Thank you. Truly.

1729
02:07:41,911 --> 02:07:47,163
MATT: "Now, return to your people victorious. You
achieved what your mother could not and her memory

1730
02:07:47,163 --> 02:07:49,674
"lives on in you."

1731
02:07:50,970 --> 02:07:52,264
MARISHA: Thank you.

1732
02:07:52,851 --> 02:07:53,654
MATT: And she turns--

1733
02:07:53,654 --> 02:07:58,871
MARISHA: I will keep her-- Thanks. That's all.

1734
02:07:58,871 --> 02:08:05,259
MATT: "Good night." And she begins to walk off
with her staff. You guys are able to rest for the

1735
02:08:05,259 --> 02:08:10,141
evening, prepare yourselves for the following
day's journey, however you wish that to be. So you

1736
02:08:10,141 --> 02:08:20,664
get benefits of a long rest back. So you get half
of your hit dice back, you are healed to full, you

1737
02:08:20,664 --> 02:08:24,126
get your spells, you're good.

1738
02:08:31,567 --> 02:08:33,272
TRAVIS: That was such a great party.

1739
02:08:33,666 --> 02:08:35,612
(all laugh)

1740
02:08:35,612 --> 02:08:36,859
MARISHA: That was a good party.

1741
02:08:36,859 --> 02:08:38,258
ASHLEY: Did you have so much fun, Grog?

1742
02:08:38,258 --> 02:08:40,542
TRAVIS: Yeah, I rode the dragon all night.

1743
02:08:40,542 --> 02:08:43,917
(all laugh)

1744
02:08:43,917 --> 02:08:46,448
TRAVIS: It was great.

1745
02:08:48,470 --> 02:08:55,666
MARISHA: That's true. I see Percy really quick.
Are you still concerned?

1746
02:08:55,666 --> 02:08:57,641
TALIESIN: Yeah, well, yes.

1747
02:08:57,641 --> 02:08:59,153
MARISHA: (laughs)

1748
02:08:59,153 --> 02:09:00,272
TALIESIN: Congratulations.

1749
02:09:00,272 --> 02:09:01,302
MARISHA: Wouldn't be you--

1750
02:09:01,302 --> 02:09:02,076
TALIESIN: No.

1751
02:09:02,076 --> 02:09:03,584
MARISHA: I--if you weren't concerned.

1752
02:09:03,584 --> 02:09:10,338
TALIESIN: No, and thank you for not being--
somebody has to be all right. I mean, I'm fine,

1753
02:09:10,398 --> 02:09:12,358
I'm fine.

1754
02:09:12,358 --> 02:09:16,430
MARISHA: Wouldn't be here without you, or the
others. You know that, right?

1755
02:09:16,430 --> 02:09:17,590
TALIESIN: I do.

1756
02:09:17,590 --> 02:09:26,897
MARISHA: I can't do this alone and I-- To answer
your question from yesterday, I think the problem

1757
02:09:26,897 --> 02:09:34,512
of this Aramente is that it shows you the
components of what you need to be a leader, but

1758
02:09:34,512 --> 02:09:47,317
being a leader could take a lifetime to master. If
you even can master such a thing. So lots still to

1759
02:09:47,317 --> 02:09:49,196
go, this isn't the end.

1760
02:09:49,196 --> 02:09:50,090
TALIESIN: I know.

1761
02:09:50,090 --> 02:09:51,159
MARISHA: And I hope you stay with me.

1762
02:09:51,159 --> 02:09:53,011
TALIESIN: I will, to the end.

1763
02:09:53,011 --> 02:09:54,062
MARISHA: I need you.

1764
02:09:56,432 --> 02:09:59,275
TALIESIN: I need you, too.

1765
02:09:59,339 --> 02:10:01,668
But we're not all going to make it.

1766
02:10:04,660 --> 02:10:08,977
MARISHA: Well, let's at least go home for now. Is
that okay? Is that enough for now?

1767
02:10:08,977 --> 02:10:17,471
TALIESIN: It certainly is. I am happy to try. But
things are only going to get more complicated.

1768
02:10:18,619 --> 02:10:21,009
Congratulations. That's very impressive.

1769
02:10:21,009 --> 02:10:26,455
MARISHA: I feel like once you can turn into a
dragon, things only get more complicated.

1770
02:10:26,455 --> 02:10:28,602
TALIESIN: (laughs)

1771
02:10:28,602 --> 02:10:29,639
MARISHA: That's, yeah.

1772
02:10:29,639 --> 02:10:32,456
TALIESIN: I will thankfully never know.

1773
02:10:32,456 --> 02:10:34,269
MARISHA: All right, let's go.

1774
02:10:34,651 --> 02:10:43,168
LIAM: After she left our room to go find him, I
start to suit up, and I'm looking in a full-length

1775
02:10:43,168 --> 02:10:52,957
mirror at the new fucking kraken beak gouges down
the front of me. And I notice that my two notes

1776
02:10:53,005 --> 02:11:01,673
are out of place. So I'm going to shove them back
into the folds that they're supposed to be in. And

1777
02:11:01,673 --> 02:11:05,767
spend a couple minutes to button all the way up
and leave the room.

1778
02:11:05,767 --> 02:11:07,804
MATT: Okay.

1779
02:11:11,373 --> 02:11:14,059
TRAVIS: Can I find Tary?

1780
02:11:14,059 --> 02:11:15,896
MATT: Yeah.

1781
02:11:15,896 --> 02:11:17,978
SAM: Oh, good morning.

1782
02:11:17,978 --> 02:11:20,918
TRAVIS: No, it's like real late, right?

1783
02:11:20,918 --> 02:11:22,124
SAM: I don't know. Is it?

1784
02:11:22,124 --> 02:11:23,040
MATT: You haven't quite gone to bed yet.

1785
02:11:23,040 --> 02:11:23,730
SAM: Oh!

1786
02:11:23,730 --> 02:11:24,472
MATT: It's late evening.

1787
02:11:24,472 --> 02:11:25,315
SAM: Good evening!

1788
02:11:25,315 --> 02:11:27,147
TRAVIS: Jesus, that fight knocked you goofy,
didn't it?

1789
02:11:27,147 --> 02:11:34,687
SAM: I have not been that close to death ever
before. But I feel like in a way I learned

1790
02:11:34,687 --> 02:11:37,417
something from the experience.

1791
02:11:37,417 --> 02:11:38,642
TRAVIS: What?

1792
02:11:40,597 --> 02:11:52,744
(all laugh)

1793
02:11:52,744 --> 02:11:54,515
SAM: That's fair.

1794
02:11:54,568 --> 02:11:59,816
(all laugh)

1795
02:11:59,816 --> 02:12:01,882
SAM: Tell me, I saw you up there fighting.

1796
02:12:01,882 --> 02:12:02,790
TRAVIS: Mm-hm.

1797
02:12:02,790 --> 02:12:05,160
SAM: You were brave and strong.

1798
02:12:05,160 --> 02:12:07,731
TRAVIS: Yep. Yep.

1799
02:12:07,731 --> 02:12:16,021
SAM: We were duking it out, you and me, 'til the
very end of that fight and well, as one seasoned

1800
02:12:16,021 --> 02:12:17,231
warrior to another--

1801
02:12:17,231 --> 02:12:18,780
TRAVIS: Mm-hm.

1802
02:12:18,780 --> 02:12:24,943
SAM: Do you have any tips? Any notes for me? Any
thoughts to improve my warfare skills? Should I

1803
02:12:24,943 --> 02:12:31,833
move more? Should I think of cool one-liners to
yell out as I hit my enemies?

1804
02:12:31,833 --> 02:12:36,632
TRAVIS: Ooh, yeah. That always helps. Right?
Someone like you, I would probably stay on the

1805
02:12:36,632 --> 02:12:41,630
outside. You got a little in the crunch zone,
right? You seem to have

1806
02:12:41,630 --> 02:12:43,791
a good range on your weapons.

1807
02:12:43,791 --> 02:12:48,001
SAM: Well, yes, but my rod is best at close-up
action.

1808
02:12:48,001 --> 02:12:53,577
TRAVIS: Most rods are good close-up but, you know,
if you could stay on the outside with it, maybe

1809
02:12:53,577 --> 02:12:56,676
you'll have better success? But, I wanted to give
you something.

1810
02:12:56,676 --> 02:12:57,579
SAM: Oh!

1811
02:12:57,579 --> 02:13:02,479
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's like a last resort, right?
Cause you went like eee! And it was not good.

1812
02:13:02,479 --> 02:13:03,477
SAM: No.

1813
02:13:03,477 --> 02:13:09,124
TRAVIS:So I want to give you a magic egg. And I
reach into the bag of holding and I take out a

1814
02:13:09,124 --> 02:13:14,353
basilisk egg that I have no fucking idea how old
it is. But, it's in there. There are six of them.

1815
02:13:14,396 --> 02:13:15,869
MATT: It's old.

1816
02:13:15,869 --> 02:13:21,010
TRAVIS: This egg is very, very special.

1817
02:13:21,010 --> 02:13:22,361
SAM: Oh my god.

1818
02:13:22,361 --> 02:13:31,017
MATT: It's about this big and the outside of it
has this very layered stone look to it. Almost

1819
02:13:31,017 --> 02:13:37,169
like when plates shift and you watch old sediment
stone stick out. And you can see the different

1820
02:13:37,169 --> 02:13:41,603
types of stone layers, geologically. It's that
kind of a texture down the side of it and it's

1821
02:13:41,603 --> 02:13:44,928
like a dark gray, almost blue color.

1822
02:13:44,928 --> 02:13:52,475
TRAVIS: This egg comes from a very ancient magical
beast. If you find yourself in a dire need. Like

1823
02:13:52,475 --> 02:13:53,626
in that last fight.

1824
02:13:53,626 --> 02:13:54,493
SAM: Yes. Yes.

1825
02:13:54,493 --> 02:14:03,900
TRAVIS: If you break it and consume its contents,
you will be granted immense power.

1826
02:14:03,900 --> 02:14:05,148
SAM: Really?

1827
02:14:05,148 --> 02:14:11,933
TRAVIS: Indeed. But only in times of great need. I
trust I don't have to emphasize

1828
02:14:11,933 --> 02:14:14,058
how important that is.

1829
02:14:14,058 --> 02:14:15,718
MATT: Grog, make a deception check.

1830
02:14:15,718 --> 02:14:19,055
TRAVIS: Shit! Come on big whammy.

1831
02:14:19,055 --> 02:14:20,901
TALIESIN: I'm so proud of you, Travis. However
this goes, I'm so proud of you.

1832
02:14:20,901 --> 02:14:23,073
TRAVIS: Yes! 15.

1833
02:14:23,073 --> 02:14:27,967
MATT: Make an insight check, Taryon.

1834
02:14:27,967 --> 02:14:29,172
LIAM: You're not Scanlan.

1835
02:14:29,172 --> 02:14:30,167
SAM: Eight.

1836
02:14:30,167 --> 02:14:34,016
(all laugh)

1837
02:14:34,016 --> 02:14:36,774
TRAVIS: I out-rolled somebody!

1838
02:14:36,774 --> 02:14:38,922
LIAM: With your mind!

1839
02:14:38,922 --> 02:14:40,427
TALIESIN: You used your mind.

1840
02:14:40,427 --> 02:14:42,824
MATT: This is a mighty gift.

1841
02:14:42,824 --> 02:14:48,843
SAM: Adding it to my list. Basilisk-- wait, I
don't know what it is. It's just an egg.

1842
02:14:48,843 --> 02:14:49,958
A magical egg.

1843
02:14:49,958 --> 02:14:53,003
MATT: A magical egg of power. To be consumed.

1844
02:14:53,003 --> 02:14:54,270
MARISHA: It's like a Kinder Egg. There's a toy
inside.

1845
02:14:54,270 --> 02:14:55,434
MATT: Kind of. Yeah.

1846
02:14:55,434 --> 02:14:57,572
LIAM: Except it's full of sulfurous shit.

1847
02:14:57,572 --> 02:15:00,686
TRAVIS: That shit is rank.

1848
02:15:00,686 --> 02:15:04,266
LAURA: I imagine that I've been introducing Pike
to the whole crew.

1849
02:15:04,266 --> 02:15:06,361
Since you like to sail so much.

1850
02:15:06,361 --> 02:15:07,851
ASHLEY: Yeah. Hey, crew.

1851
02:15:07,851 --> 02:15:09,422
SAM: Thank you.

1852
02:15:09,422 --> 02:15:11,179
TRAVIS: You're welcome.

1853
02:15:11,179 --> 02:15:12,301
MATT: Okay.

1854
02:15:12,301 --> 02:15:15,674
ASHLEY: Is Doty, Dottie, his robot around?

1855
02:15:15,674 --> 02:15:16,996
LAURA: Doodie.

1856
02:15:16,996 --> 02:15:21,027
MATT: The robot stays with him when he is told
otherwise not to. So, it's hanging with him. When

1857
02:15:21,027 --> 02:15:28,485
you're introduced to the crew, they're all your
ilk. They're all salty, sarcastic folk. Captain

1858
02:15:28,485 --> 02:15:36,455
Adella and you could-- they're all taken aback by
your strangely-not-really-physically-there form.

1859
02:15:36,455 --> 02:15:43,209
But, after a bit of trading some tales about a few
interesting at-sea endeavors, you guys get along

1860
02:15:43,209 --> 02:15:49,816
swimmingly and it's a fast friendship between you
and Captain Adella.

1861
02:15:49,816 --> 02:15:50,748
ASHLEY: Fantastic.

1862
02:15:50,748 --> 02:15:51,759
LAURA: She's fucking cool.

1863
02:15:51,759 --> 02:15:52,966
ASHLEY: She seems rad.

1864
02:15:52,966 --> 02:15:53,863
LAURA: Yeah.

1865
02:15:53,863 --> 02:15:55,472
MATT: So, what're you doing?

1866
02:15:55,472 --> 02:16:00,630
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to go over to Tary.

1867
02:16:00,630 --> 02:16:05,274
MATT: Okay. Taryon, after you're granted this
majestic egg, as you're walking back to your

1868
02:16:05,274 --> 02:16:08,934
homestead, the glowing gnome approaches you.

1869
02:16:08,934 --> 02:16:09,868
SAM: Oh! Hello.

1870
02:16:09,868 --> 02:16:21,474
ASHLEY: Hello again. I have a request of your
robot. Your Doty. Am I saying this right?

1871
02:16:21,474 --> 02:16:23,584
SAM: My personal manservant.

1872
02:16:23,584 --> 02:16:25,110
ASHLEY: Your personal manservant.

1873
02:16:25,110 --> 02:16:26,175
SAM: Yes.

1874
02:16:26,175 --> 02:16:30,575
ASHLEY: Could he draw some things for me?

1875
02:16:30,575 --> 02:16:38,364
SAM: In Gnome, I say, absolutely m'lady. Whatever
you would request.

1876
02:16:39,165 --> 02:16:40,359
MATT: You are a m'lady.

1877
02:16:40,359 --> 02:16:43,610
MARISHA: We totally called it.

1878
02:16:45,083 --> 02:16:47,003
MATT: Continue.

1879
02:16:47,003 --> 02:16:54,428
ASHLEY: And in Common, I say back, thank you so
much. Doty,

1880
02:16:54,492 --> 02:17:02,899
would you mind drawing portraits for me?

1881
02:17:04,071 --> 02:17:06,589
MATT: Looks back to you, Taryon.

1882
02:17:06,589 --> 02:17:11,280
SAM: Do whatever the young lady asks.

1883
02:17:11,683 --> 02:17:13,344
MATT: Pulls the book out.

1884
02:17:13,344 --> 02:17:23,482
ASHLEY: Could you draw some portraits of this
group? Of Grog. Of Vax and Vex.

1885
02:17:23,482 --> 02:17:25,764
Keyleth and Percy.

1886
02:17:25,764 --> 02:17:30,514
SAM: Just a little bit of a note, here. He doesn't
know who any of those people are.

1887
02:17:30,514 --> 02:17:35,842
ASHLEY: Okay. So the people that I point to. Could
you just draw each of them please?

1888
02:17:35,842 --> 02:17:38,993
MATT: Everyone's kind of scattered to the four
winds right now.

1889
02:17:38,993 --> 02:17:40,199
ASHLEY: Shit.

1890
02:17:40,199 --> 02:17:41,209
LAURA: I'm there.

1891
02:17:41,209 --> 02:17:42,484
SAM: I'll help you point them out to Doty.

1892
02:17:42,484 --> 02:17:43,644
MATT: Yeah, Vex is there.

1893
02:17:43,644 --> 02:17:44,465
ASHLEY: Okay.

1894
02:17:44,465 --> 02:17:46,020
MATT: Yeah, you point out to where they're all
staying and--

1895
02:17:46,020 --> 02:17:47,949
MARISHA: We're gathering up anyway. We're walking
over.

1896
02:17:47,949 --> 02:17:54,658
ASHLEY: When you're all done, just bring them to
me. Thank you so much.

1897
02:17:54,658 --> 02:17:57,496
SAM: Is there any particular style you'd like them
to be drawn in?

1898
02:17:57,496 --> 02:17:59,256
ASHLEY: Just as realistic as possible.

1899
02:17:59,256 --> 02:18:00,515
SAM: Realism. All right.

1900
02:18:00,515 --> 02:18:01,497
ASHLEY: Realism.

1901
02:18:01,497 --> 02:18:05,725
MATT: All right.

1902
02:18:05,725 --> 02:18:10,634
ASHLEY: And I say, thank you, in Gnomish. In
Gnome.

1903
02:18:10,634 --> 02:18:12,833
SAM: I say, you're warcome in Gnome.

1904
02:18:12,833 --> 02:18:19,480
(all laugh)

1905
02:18:19,480 --> 02:18:21,097
TALIESIN: I've been waiting for it.

1906
02:18:21,097 --> 02:18:22,561
ASHLEY: Okay. That's all.

1907
02:18:22,561 --> 02:18:33,742
MATT: All right. So as you all go to rest for the
evening, Pike, the granted presence here through

1908
02:18:33,742 --> 02:18:40,369
Sarenrae's will begins to withdraw. Her strength
through the divine gate to keep you in this,

1909
02:18:40,369 --> 02:18:45,785
seemingly drained. You sense that you'll be
returning back to Emon until you're retrieved by

1910
02:18:45,785 --> 02:18:48,107
your allies here.

1911
02:18:48,265 --> 02:18:49,574
ASHLEY: Okay.

1912
02:18:49,574 --> 02:18:56,398
MATT: So, you'll only have a short time. As the
rest of you guys go to rest for the evening and

1913
02:18:56,398 --> 02:19:04,361
you all go to sleep, Percy, Keyleth, Vax, Vex, and
Grog, I need you guys to roll perception checks.

1914
02:19:06,725 --> 02:19:07,870
TRAVIS: I got this.

1915
02:19:07,870 --> 02:19:09,522
SAM: I'm just doing this all night.

1916
02:19:09,522 --> 02:19:10,768
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil.

1917
02:19:10,768 --> 02:19:12,892
TRAVIS: Are we going Gil? Yeah. Don't fuck me,
Gil.

1918
02:19:12,892 --> 02:19:14,160
MARISHA: That's not bad.

1919
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:15,651
SAM: You got to try Gil.

1920
02:19:15,651 --> 02:19:16,876
TALIESIN: No! I'm going with that one.

1921
02:19:16,876 --> 02:19:17,965
SAM: I'm negating that. Roll Gil.

1922
02:19:17,965 --> 02:19:18,884
TALIESIN: You don't get to negate that one.

1923
02:19:18,884 --> 02:19:20,030
SAM: I'm negating it. Roll Gil.

1924
02:19:20,030 --> 02:19:20,858
TRAVIS: 19.

1925
02:19:20,858 --> 02:19:21,571
MATT: Oh!

1926
02:19:21,571 --> 02:19:22,381
TRAVIS: A natural 19.

1927
02:19:22,381 --> 02:19:23,238
LAURA: 29.

1928
02:19:23,238 --> 02:19:24,222
TALIESIN: No I'm going with my first one. You
don't get to negate my roll.

1929
02:19:24,222 --> 02:19:25,273
LIAM: 22.

1930
02:19:25,273 --> 02:19:26,232
SAM: He rolled a three.

1931
02:19:26,232 --> 02:19:26,985
MARISHA: 23.

1932
02:19:26,985 --> 02:19:27,742
TALIESIN: I did not roll--

1933
02:19:27,742 --> 02:19:28,450
MATT: Wow!

1934
02:19:28,450 --> 02:19:29,703
TALIESIN: I'm going with my first roll because
he's a jerk.

1935
02:19:29,703 --> 02:19:31,425
MATT: All right. What was the first one?

1936
02:19:31,425 --> 02:19:34,379
TALIESIN: 27. Jerk.

1937
02:19:34,379 --> 02:19:36,264
MATT: Okay.

1938
02:19:36,264 --> 02:19:38,528
SAM: Your friends all rolled with Gil.

1939
02:19:38,528 --> 02:19:40,249
MATT: Throughout the evening--

1940
02:19:40,249 --> 02:19:41,953
MARISHA: Rolling with Gil.

1941
02:19:41,953 --> 02:19:48,896
MATT: At some point in the night, each of you
individually wakes up in the wee hours as a sound

1942
02:19:48,896 --> 02:19:54,210
rouses you from your slumber as you glance over in
one of the nearby open windowed walls. You see a

1943
02:19:54,210 --> 02:20:00,277
large, metallic man-shape appear. And just start
feverishly sketching while staring at you.

1944
02:20:00,277 --> 02:20:03,032
(all laugh)

1945
02:20:03,032 --> 02:20:06,650
MATT: One, by one, by one, by one.

1946
02:20:06,650 --> 02:20:08,781
LAURA: As our faces are like--

1947
02:20:08,781 --> 02:20:11,592
SAM: He likes to watch.

1948
02:20:11,592 --> 02:20:14,939
LIAM: That was Tary's fucking automaton.

1949
02:20:14,939 --> 02:20:17,034
MARISHA: I'm not dreaming. I'm not dreaming.

1950
02:20:17,034 --> 02:20:18,270
TALIESIN: Okay, yeah.

1951
02:20:18,270 --> 02:20:19,766
TRAVIS: Does anyone try to talk to the automaton?

1952
02:20:19,766 --> 02:20:20,976
MARISHA: Oh, jeez. Oh, jeez.

1953
02:20:20,976 --> 02:20:22,750
TALIESIN: I think we'd just stay perfectly still?

1954
02:20:22,750 --> 02:20:23,508
LAURA: Yeah.

1955
02:20:23,508 --> 02:20:24,646
(all laugh)

1956
02:20:24,646 --> 02:20:27,119
TALIESIN: And try and lift our chin and push
forward.

1957
02:20:27,119 --> 02:20:30,473
LAURA: 'Til it looks like a good angle, at least.

1958
02:20:30,473 --> 02:20:32,877
LIAM: I slowly pull the sheet up--

1959
02:20:32,877 --> 02:20:34,865
MARISHA: Yeah, higher, yeah.

1960
02:20:34,865 --> 02:20:37,187
TRAVIS: I pull the sheet a little lower.

1961
02:20:37,187 --> 02:20:44,771
(all laugh)

1962
02:20:44,771 --> 02:20:49,895
MATT: And Doty continues sketching, adjusting to
the new positions.

1963
02:20:49,895 --> 02:20:53,646
LIAM: Moves an adjacent piece of paper next to it
and keeps going.

1964
02:20:53,646 --> 02:20:58,880
MATT: Keeps taping them on. All right.

1965
02:20:58,880 --> 02:21:00,643
ASHLEY: Is he done?

1966
02:21:00,643 --> 02:21:03,402
MATT: I will say--

1967
02:21:03,402 --> 02:21:06,226
ASHLEY: I'm just afraid I'm gonna (whoosh).

1968
02:21:06,226 --> 02:21:09,750
MATT: I will say, for the sake of narrative of
this, the energy will carry

1969
02:21:09,750 --> 02:21:11,291
you through to the morning.

1970
02:21:11,291 --> 02:21:11,922
SAM: Yes.

1971
02:21:11,922 --> 02:21:12,846
ASHLEY: Okay.

1972
02:21:12,846 --> 02:21:18,199
MATT: So, upon everyone waking, and gathering
again before heading however way you wish, the

1973
02:21:18,199 --> 02:21:27,522
crew is by their boats to return to the ship,
Uvenda is waiting to see you off, and, as you all

1974
02:21:27,522 --> 02:21:32,645
begin to gather, you watch Pike as she approaches,
her form flickering in the familiar visual of a

1975
02:21:32,645 --> 02:21:37,080
temporary time before she has to return--

1976
02:21:37,080 --> 02:21:37,921
LAURA: Oh no!

1977
02:21:37,921 --> 02:21:38,906
ASHLEY: It's okay.

1978
02:21:38,906 --> 02:21:43,976
MATT: As you approach to speak to everybody,
suddenly (grinding robot movement) from the side,

1979
02:21:43,976 --> 02:21:46,248
Doty seems to just slam into view, like some weird
hype man.

1980
02:21:46,248 --> 02:21:50,518
TRAVIS: A hype man! Yeah yeah!

1981
02:21:50,518 --> 02:21:56,948
MATT: And immediately just hands you a metallic
fist filled with pages torn out of the tome.

1982
02:21:57,994 --> 02:22:02,796
ASHLEY: Thank you so much.

1983
02:22:02,796 --> 02:22:06,045
MATT: And then runs off towards Taryon.

1984
02:22:07,004 --> 02:22:11,461
ASHLEY: Tary. Come here.

1985
02:22:11,461 --> 02:22:12,526
SAM: Who, me?

1986
02:22:12,526 --> 02:22:13,558
ASHLEY: Yes, you.

1987
02:22:13,558 --> 02:22:14,789
TALIESIN: Couldn't be.

1988
02:22:14,789 --> 02:22:16,358
SAM: Hello.

1989
02:22:16,358 --> 02:22:26,366
ASHLEY: Hello. So, I figured you would have a
little bit of an easier time if you know the names

1990
02:22:26,366 --> 02:22:35,887
of the people that you're spending time with. I
had him make you some, I don't know, maybe some

1991
02:22:35,887 --> 02:22:44,736
flash cards. So, I take out a quill. I hold up a
photo. Who is this?

1992
02:22:45,440 --> 02:22:54,001
MATT: What you see before you, is a very
beautifully realistically drawn image of a female

1993
02:22:54,061 --> 02:23:01,281
half-elven druid, and a male half-elven rogue
paladin, both clutching bed-sheets, going--

1994
02:23:01,281 --> 02:23:12,675
(all laugh)

1995
02:23:12,675 --> 02:23:16,029
SAM: That's amazing. In the same drawing?

1996
02:23:16,029 --> 02:23:18,233
MATT: Yeah.

1997
02:23:18,233 --> 02:23:30,667
SAM: Oh! But how did-- I mean, they would have had
to have been--

1998
02:23:30,667 --> 02:23:37,466
ASHLEY: I didn't realize he was going to draw them
in their sleep. So, let's just--

1999
02:23:37,466 --> 02:23:42,174
LIAM: Please, go through every picture, please!

2000
02:23:42,174 --> 02:23:47,470
SAM: Oh. I-- so many more questions than answers.

2001
02:23:47,470 --> 02:23:53,658
(all laugh)

2002
02:23:53,658 --> 02:23:56,288
MARISHA: It hurts!

2003
02:23:56,288 --> 02:24:05,959
SAM: One of those two was dead yesterday, and yet
they still found time to-- well. The one on the

2004
02:24:05,959 --> 02:24:13,361
left, I lovingly refer to her as Antlers. She is
the most powerful and leader of the group.

2005
02:24:14,674 --> 02:24:23,327
ASHLEY: All those things are true, but take this
quill. Now, next to her picture,

2006
02:24:23,327 --> 02:24:26,062
please write 'Keyleth'.

2007
02:24:26,062 --> 02:24:27,488
SAM: Doty? You heard her.

2008
02:24:27,488 --> 02:24:30,976
ASHLEY: No! No. No, no. No.

2009
02:24:30,976 --> 02:24:33,813
MATT: Doty stops when she says no.

2010
02:24:33,813 --> 02:24:36,108
ASHLEY: You are going to write it down.

2011
02:24:36,108 --> 02:24:37,005
TRAVIS: Mama Pike!

2012
02:24:37,005 --> 02:24:37,915
ASHLEY: Do you know how to write?

2013
02:24:37,915 --> 02:24:38,813
MARISHA: Mama Pike.

2014
02:24:38,813 --> 02:24:40,434
SAM: Of course I know how to write. I'm an
educated man.

2015
02:24:40,434 --> 02:24:41,696
ASHLEY: Okay, I would--

2016
02:24:41,696 --> 02:24:43,068
TRAVIS: Oh god, how does he know how to write?

2017
02:24:43,068 --> 02:24:43,798
LAURA: (gasps)

2018
02:24:43,798 --> 02:24:45,622
SAM: In what language?

2019
02:24:45,622 --> 02:24:48,756
ASHLEY: What language do you prefer?

2020
02:24:48,756 --> 02:24:51,540
SAM: I prefer Gnome when I'm with you.

2021
02:24:51,540 --> 02:24:52,677
ASHLEY: Okay.

2022
02:24:52,677 --> 02:24:54,086
LIAM: Old habits die hard.

2023
02:24:54,086 --> 02:24:55,540
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah!

2024
02:24:55,540 --> 02:24:58,563
SAM: It's good practice.

2025
02:24:58,563 --> 02:24:59,927
TRAVIS: Little bleed-through.

2026
02:24:59,927 --> 02:25:05,419
ASHLEY: Okay. So write down 'Keyleth.'

2027
02:25:05,419 --> 02:25:13,775
SAM: Odd vowel sounds in your weird language.
Okay! Key-leth.

2028
02:25:13,775 --> 02:25:16,160
ASHLEY: The man laying next to her--

2029
02:25:16,160 --> 02:25:17,339
SAM: Mm-hm?

2030
02:25:17,339 --> 02:25:19,441
ASHLEY: Do you know his name?

2031
02:25:19,441 --> 02:25:22,436
SAM: Little Elf Boy.

2032
02:25:22,436 --> 02:25:30,140
ASHLEY: I would never say that again. His name is
Vax.

2033
02:25:30,140 --> 02:25:32,252
SAM: With a 'B'? Like Bax?

2034
02:25:32,252 --> 02:25:36,661
ASHLEY: With a 'V', as in--

2035
02:25:36,661 --> 02:25:37,650
SAM: Vagina?

2036
02:25:37,650 --> 02:25:38,599
ASHLEY: Vagina.

2037
02:25:38,599 --> 02:25:41,496
(all laugh)

2038
02:25:41,496 --> 02:25:44,336
TALIESIN: Manna from heaven. Manna from heaven.

2039
02:25:44,336 --> 02:25:45,438
SAM: Got it.

2040
02:25:45,438 --> 02:25:47,037
LAURA: Oh god.

2041
02:25:47,037 --> 02:25:49,184
SAM: 'X'. All right.

2042
02:25:49,184 --> 02:25:50,072
ASHLEY: Next up.

2043
02:25:50,072 --> 02:25:53,465
SAM: You know what, that one sounds familiar, I
feel like he's introduced himself to me.

2044
02:25:53,465 --> 02:25:55,547
ASHLEY: Okay. Next up, who's this?

2045
02:25:55,547 --> 02:26:01,120
MATT: This is another pair. (laughs) This one--

2046
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:02,378
TRAVIS: I'm so happy.

2047
02:26:02,378 --> 02:26:12,017
MATT: --less shy. It appears to be a human male,
looking confused, with glasses pressed up above

2048
02:26:12,017 --> 02:26:18,475
the top of the forehead, and a half-elven,
dark-haired, female, on top--

2049
02:26:18,475 --> 02:26:19,872
LAURA: (laughs)

2050
02:26:19,872 --> 02:26:23,516
MATT: -- glancing back with a 'don't you fucking
dare' expression.

2051
02:26:23,516 --> 02:26:24,497
MARISHA: Yeah.

2052
02:26:24,497 --> 02:26:26,222
(all laugh)

2053
02:26:26,222 --> 02:26:30,106
SAM: Oh! Oh, well. I--

2054
02:26:30,106 --> 02:26:32,193
ASHLEY: Yes, I know, you're learning so much.

2055
02:26:32,193 --> 02:26:33,584
SAM: May I, for a moment?

2056
02:26:33,584 --> 02:26:36,226
ASHLEY: Sure!

2057
02:26:36,226 --> 02:26:40,992
SAM: Do you think this is up? Or--

2058
02:26:40,992 --> 02:26:43,267
ASHLEY: You could have it any way you like it.

2059
02:26:43,267 --> 02:26:45,476
(all laugh)

2060
02:26:45,476 --> 02:26:46,656
LIAM: Oh my god.

2061
02:26:46,656 --> 02:26:52,228
SAM: I've read about that. All right.

2062
02:26:52,228 --> 02:26:56,930
ASHLEY: Just looking at the faces, then, who do
you think they are?

2063
02:26:56,930 --> 02:27:00,421
SAM: The happy one is Little Elf Girl--

2064
02:27:00,421 --> 02:27:04,750
ASHLEY: Ooh. I would definitely not ever say that
to her.

2065
02:27:04,750 --> 02:27:10,058
SAM: All right. All right. What's her real name?

2066
02:27:10,058 --> 02:27:13,329
ASHLEY: Her name is Vex.

2067
02:27:13,329 --> 02:27:14,604
SAM: All right. Vex.

2068
02:27:14,604 --> 02:27:18,815
ASHLEY: And you know that her and Vax are twin
brother and sister?

2069
02:27:18,815 --> 02:27:20,233
SAM: I could tell by the bone structure--

2070
02:27:20,233 --> 02:27:20,818
ASHLEY: Okay.

2071
02:27:20,818 --> 02:27:21,983
SAM: -- and the contempt.

2072
02:27:21,983 --> 02:27:26,223
(all laugh)

2073
02:27:26,223 --> 02:27:28,770
TALIESIN: Oh! Oh.

2074
02:27:28,770 --> 02:27:37,084
ASHLEY: Now. (laughs) The man laying next to her,
what is his name?

2075
02:27:37,084 --> 02:27:40,443
SAM: Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Korrolo de
Rolo the third.

2076
02:27:40,443 --> 02:27:42,546
(all laugh)

2077
02:27:42,546 --> 02:27:43,271
TALIESIN: Well done!

2078
02:27:43,271 --> 02:27:44,295
SAM: Almost! Almost!

2079
02:27:44,295 --> 02:27:45,242
TRAVIS: Oh man!

2080
02:27:45,242 --> 02:27:47,438
SAM: Almost! Almost! Klossowski de Rolo the
third!

2081
02:27:47,438 --> 02:27:48,245
TALIESIN: Close enough!

2082
02:27:48,245 --> 02:27:48,938
SAM: Percival--

2083
02:27:48,938 --> 02:27:49,638
TALIESIN: Close enough!

2084
02:27:49,638 --> 02:27:51,031
SAM: --Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel--

2085
02:27:51,031 --> 02:27:52,766
TALIESIN: Muselix.

2086
02:27:52,766 --> 02:27:53,917
MARISHA: (laughs) Von Muselix.

2087
02:27:53,917 --> 02:27:55,348
SAM: Argh, so close!

2088
02:27:55,348 --> 02:27:57,547
LIAM: You know what? The Klossowski, Klossowski--

2089
02:27:57,547 --> 02:27:58,612
SAM: Klossowski de Rolo the third!

2090
02:27:58,612 --> 02:27:59,482
TALIESIN: It's a little--

2091
02:27:59,482 --> 02:28:00,295
LAURA: Gets ya every time.

2092
02:28:00,295 --> 02:28:01,335
LIAM: That was bullshit. That was bullshit.

2093
02:28:01,335 --> 02:28:02,490
TALIESIN: That all depends on how much whiskey.
That's fair.

2094
02:28:02,490 --> 02:28:03,813
ASHLEY: Please write it down.

2095
02:28:03,813 --> 02:28:06,133
TALIESIN: That's a whiskey-based pronunciation.

2096
02:28:06,133 --> 02:28:07,762
SAM: That one I'm going to do in Common.

2097
02:28:07,762 --> 02:28:13,434
(all laugh)

2098
02:28:13,434 --> 02:28:16,234
SAM: And you know what? I'll just abbreviate the
middle part.

2099
02:28:16,234 --> 02:28:17,399
TALIESIN: That's okay.

2100
02:28:17,399 --> 02:28:20,433
SAM: P... de Rolo.

2101
02:28:20,433 --> 02:28:21,676
LIAM: What's Percy's rapper name?

2102
02:28:21,676 --> 02:28:25,985
ASHLEY: Great. Two more to go. Who's this?

2103
02:28:25,985 --> 02:28:42,811
MATT: Well see, all right. This one is Pike, in
her gnomish form, still wearing her armor in her

2104
02:28:42,811 --> 02:28:51,021
astral form, looking like she realized she didn't
phrase it properly when she made the request. And

2105
02:28:51,021 --> 02:28:55,511
being the last one sketched, and that moment her
expression says, 'Oh no.'

2106
02:28:55,511 --> 02:28:57,871
(all laugh)

2107
02:28:57,871 --> 02:29:01,057
TRAVIS: Oh no.

2108
02:29:01,057 --> 02:29:07,860
SAM: Before I answer, uh, (accented) answer--

2109
02:29:07,860 --> 02:29:09,016
MARISHA: An-swer.

2110
02:29:09,016 --> 02:29:12,000
SAM: -- just a quick process question, here.

2111
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:12,881
ASHLEY: Okay.

2112
02:29:12,881 --> 02:29:22,282
SAM: In the other images, there was some revelry,
some intercourse happening. Is that-- now that I'm

2113
02:29:22,282 --> 02:29:24,144
a full-fledged member, do I--

2114
02:29:24,144 --> 02:29:26,706
(all laugh)

2115
02:29:26,706 --> 02:29:32,191
SAM: Do I get to partake? Is this how it works
with everyone? Or is it just certain members--

2116
02:29:32,191 --> 02:29:33,244
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

2117
02:29:33,244 --> 02:29:35,900
SAM: Is it a hierarchy? Is it some sort of a--

2118
02:29:35,900 --> 02:29:37,344
TRAVIS: Oh god.

2119
02:29:37,344 --> 02:29:38,287
SAM: -- a cultish--

2120
02:29:38,287 --> 02:29:39,393
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

2121
02:29:39,393 --> 02:29:45,621
SAM: -- thing, where you have to prove yourself
sexually and in battle, or-- how does that work?

2122
02:29:45,621 --> 02:29:46,950
TRAVIS: I can't even handle this.

2123
02:29:46,950 --> 02:29:49,159
SAM: Or is it-- am I misreading this?

2124
02:29:49,159 --> 02:29:58,614
ASHLEY: You know, I think you should just continue
to try to explore that.

2125
02:29:58,614 --> 02:30:00,549
(all laugh)

2126
02:30:00,549 --> 02:30:01,346
ASHLEY: Because--

2127
02:30:01,346 --> 02:30:02,134
TRAVIS: Wow.

2128
02:30:02,134 --> 02:30:04,584
ASHLEY: It would just be great just to see what
happens. You never know,

2129
02:30:04,584 --> 02:30:07,386
Tary, you just never know.

2130
02:30:07,386 --> 02:30:09,113
SAM: All right.

2131
02:30:09,113 --> 02:30:10,861
ASHLEY: I would never tell you no.

2132
02:30:10,861 --> 02:30:11,845
LAURA: (gasps)

2133
02:30:11,845 --> 02:30:13,094
ASHLEY: No! Not me--

2134
02:30:13,094 --> 02:30:15,760
(all laugh)

2135
02:30:15,760 --> 02:30:23,488
ASHLEY: Let me rephrase. I would never tell you no
to not trying with the people of the group.

2136
02:30:23,488 --> 02:30:26,676
SAM: So you're saying that membership has its
privileges?

2137
02:30:26,676 --> 02:30:28,431
ASHLEY: Mayhaps.

2138
02:30:28,431 --> 02:30:30,705
LAURA: Oh god.

2139
02:30:30,705 --> 02:30:32,789
ASHLEY: Do you know my name?

2140
02:30:32,789 --> 02:30:34,841
SAM: Daughter of Sarenrae, I'm guessing.

2141
02:30:34,841 --> 02:30:36,979
ASHLEY: No. It's Pike.

2142
02:30:36,979 --> 02:30:40,632
SAM: Hm. Pike.

2143
02:30:40,632 --> 02:30:42,336
ASHLEY: And last, but certainly not least--

2144
02:30:42,336 --> 02:30:43,921
MATT: Whoa.

2145
02:30:43,921 --> 02:30:44,928
SAM: Oh boy.

2146
02:30:44,928 --> 02:30:46,906
(all laugh)

2147
02:30:46,906 --> 02:30:47,653
LIAM: Narrate it, Matt.

2148
02:30:47,653 --> 02:30:49,374
SAM: Doty, she said realism.

2149
02:30:49,374 --> 02:30:51,662
MATT: (creaks)

2150
02:30:51,662 --> 02:30:52,655
SAM: Really?

2151
02:30:52,655 --> 02:30:56,439
(all laugh)

2152
02:30:56,439 --> 02:31:03,801
MATT: And there, in a classic Michelangelo-style
pose, one knee cocked to the side, the beard

2153
02:31:03,801 --> 02:31:12,871
fluffed, the rippling scarred muscles, and the
obvious half-giant side of Grog Strongjaw before

2154
02:31:12,934 --> 02:31:14,320
you on the page.

2155
02:31:14,320 --> 02:31:17,089
LIAM: That is not a picture of a goliath and a
halfling, by the way.

2156
02:31:18,195 --> 02:31:21,930
SAM: I mean, how does he walk?

2157
02:31:21,984 --> 02:31:24,796
TALIESIN: With confidence and pride.

2158
02:31:24,796 --> 02:31:25,945
TRAVIS: Pick a leg.

2159
02:31:25,945 --> 02:31:26,862
ASHLEY: Yes.

2160
02:31:26,862 --> 02:31:31,785
SAM: Wow. Wow.

2161
02:31:31,785 --> 02:31:33,327
ASHLEY: I know.

2162
02:31:33,327 --> 02:31:37,110
SAM: That is just-- that is primal.

2163
02:31:37,110 --> 02:31:40,515
ASHLEY: He took some artistic liberties with this
one.

2164
02:31:40,515 --> 02:31:41,485
SAM: Huh.

2165
02:31:41,485 --> 02:31:42,193
LAURA: Ho ho ho!

2166
02:31:42,193 --> 02:31:43,363
LIAM: Made it smaller.

2167
02:31:43,363 --> 02:31:47,353
SAM: All right. I've been taking to calling him
Jumbo, or the Big Guy.

2168
02:31:47,353 --> 02:31:48,433
ASHLEY: Okay.

2169
02:31:48,433 --> 02:31:50,465
SAM: And it seems that I was correct.

2170
02:31:50,465 --> 02:31:54,567
(all laugh)

2171
02:31:54,567 --> 02:31:55,329
ASHLEY: Well, this--

2172
02:31:55,329 --> 02:31:56,419
MATT: This joke went too far.

2173
02:31:56,419 --> 02:31:57,546
ASHLEY: -- this is Grog.

2174
02:31:57,546 --> 02:31:59,813
SAM: Say that again?

2175
02:31:59,813 --> 02:32:00,883
ASHLEY: Grog.

2176
02:32:00,883 --> 02:32:02,500
SAM: Grog. Okay.

2177
02:32:02,500 --> 02:32:06,503
ASHLEY: And that is my very best friend.

2178
02:32:06,503 --> 02:32:11,472
SAM: You know, I have learned that he is a
confident ally, and a friend to me as well. And I

2179
02:32:11,472 --> 02:32:15,487
will do my best to protect him in battle in your
absence.

2180
02:32:15,487 --> 02:32:25,591
ASHLEY: Well (laughs) thank you. That is very,
very kind of you. So, before I leave, my request

2181
02:32:25,591 --> 02:32:33,835
is that you look at these every night before bed
until you learn them.

2182
02:32:33,835 --> 02:32:34,830
TRAVIS: I love it so much.

2183
02:32:34,830 --> 02:32:36,028
LIAM: Love Mama Pike.

2184
02:32:36,028 --> 02:32:41,100
SAM: Can you-- in this form, can you see me all
the time?

2185
02:32:43,881 --> 02:32:45,070
ASHLEY: Yes.

2186
02:32:47,454 --> 02:32:48,606
SAM: I will.

2187
02:32:48,606 --> 02:32:53,211
ASHLEY: So I will know if you're not looking at
your flashcards every night.

2188
02:32:53,211 --> 02:32:58,234
(all laugh)

2189
02:32:58,234 --> 02:32:59,894
ASHLEY: This is so stupid.

2190
02:32:59,894 --> 02:33:01,296
LIAM: This is Dungeons &amp; Dragons, man!

2191
02:33:01,296 --> 02:33:02,360
TALIESIN: This is amazing.

2192
02:33:02,360 --> 02:33:06,343
LIAM: This is Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

2193
02:33:06,343 --> 02:33:12,710
SAM: Milady, I swear it by my name, I will do so
as you request. Thank you for saving one of my

2194
02:33:12,710 --> 02:33:19,610
allies today, and wherever you are in the world,
know that we are fighting the good fight, and I

2195
02:33:19,610 --> 02:33:25,689
will keep your friends safe. Your friends, Greg--

2196
02:33:25,689 --> 02:33:26,805
ASHLEY: Nope.

2197
02:33:26,805 --> 02:33:30,759
SAM: -- Vox, Vox, Kiko--

2198
02:33:30,759 --> 02:33:32,708
TALIESIN: Kiko works.

2199
02:33:32,708 --> 02:33:37,391
SAM: -- and Percival Frederickstein Von Musel--

2200
02:33:37,391 --> 02:33:38,019
TALIESIN: Let it roll.

2201
02:33:38,019 --> 02:33:40,480
SAM: -- Klossowski De Rolo the third.

2202
02:33:40,534 --> 02:33:41,446
TALIESIN: That's pretty good.

2203
02:33:41,446 --> 02:33:42,607
(all cheer)

2204
02:33:42,607 --> 02:33:43,383
SAM: Ah.

2205
02:33:43,383 --> 02:33:45,985
ASHLEY: I realise that was off of memory, so I'm
gonna let it slide, but yes.

2206
02:33:45,985 --> 02:33:47,615
SAM: I have a few more nights of studying to do.

2207
02:33:47,615 --> 02:33:54,408
ASHLEY: You do. Okay. It was wonderful to spend
time with you. I'm gonna just--

2208
02:33:54,408 --> 02:33:57,311
I'm gonna go back over here.

2209
02:33:57,311 --> 02:33:58,233
SAM: All right.

2210
02:33:58,233 --> 02:33:58,977
ASHLEY: Goodbye.

2211
02:33:58,977 --> 02:34:00,202
SAM: Serf trervles.

2212
02:34:00,202 --> 02:34:01,796
(all laugh)

2213
02:34:01,796 --> 02:34:02,948
MARISHA and TALIESIN: (laugh) Serf trervles.

2214
02:34:02,948 --> 02:34:03,885
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

2215
02:34:03,885 --> 02:34:06,451
MATT: I did not expect it to go that far.

2216
02:34:06,451 --> 02:34:07,507
SAM: (laughs)

2217
02:34:07,507 --> 02:34:08,261
TRAVIS: My fucking--

2218
02:34:08,261 --> 02:34:08,833
TALIESIN: Wow.

2219
02:34:08,833 --> 02:34:09,714
TRAVIS: -- my ears hurt.

2220
02:34:09,714 --> 02:34:12,627
LIAM: I have a fresh new set of six-pack abs after
the last ten minutes.

2221
02:34:12,627 --> 02:34:14,258
MATT: Seriously.

2222
02:34:14,258 --> 02:34:16,360
SAM: We gotta get Ashley back. We gotta bring her
back.

2223
02:34:16,360 --> 02:34:17,595
MATT: All right, so as you guys get over--

2224
02:34:17,595 --> 02:34:19,943
SAM: We gotta get Ashley back.

2225
02:34:19,943 --> 02:34:21,767
ASHLEY: Sorry, that went a little bit longer than
I thought.

2226
02:34:21,767 --> 02:34:22,572
MATT: No! No!

2227
02:34:22,572 --> 02:34:24,089
TALIESIN: It was so good!

2228
02:34:24,089 --> 02:34:25,250
MATT: You know--

2229
02:34:25,250 --> 02:34:26,258
LAURA: That was awesome.

2230
02:34:26,258 --> 02:34:34,923
MATT: In Doty being literal, it lead to all of
that joy. Holy shit. So. As you guys all gather on

2231
02:34:34,988 --> 02:34:40,974
the beaches in the late morning of Vesrah, Adella
and her crew are waiting at the boats to return to

2232
02:34:40,974 --> 02:34:47,934
the ship. And Uvenda and a few other folks there,
you see Durent, you see Yulan, the little boy that

2233
02:34:47,934 --> 02:34:51,319
met you when you first got here, and a few of the
other folks that you met that evening, all

2234
02:34:51,319 --> 02:35:00,795
waiting, and as you approach, Uvenda nods, and,
"It has been an absolute pleasure to have you, Vox

2235
02:35:00,795 --> 02:35:08,398
"Machina, at the sides of Keyleth, to come and
spend time with our people, to celebrate the

2236
02:35:08,398 --> 02:35:17,882
"completion of a difficult journey. I would request
before you leave, to please return the goggles and

2237
02:35:17,882 --> 02:35:20,145
"neck pieces that we lent you."

2238
02:35:20,145 --> 02:35:21,286
MARISHA: Yeah.

2239
02:35:21,286 --> 02:35:22,979
LIAM: It's like an IMAX theater.

2240
02:35:22,979 --> 02:35:29,582
MATT: Kind of. They go and collect the pieces from
you as you go on. "And best of luck in your future

2241
02:35:29,634 --> 02:35:38,573
"journeys. If we, the Ashari of Vesrah, can be of
aid to you in the future, please let us know."

2242
02:35:38,596 --> 02:35:43,459
MARISHA: Thank you for everything. I'm sure we'll
be in contact soon.

2243
02:35:43,510 --> 02:35:44,997
MATT: Kaitiyaki.

2244
02:35:44,997 --> 02:35:47,181
MARISHA: Kaitiyaki.

2245
02:35:47,181 --> 02:35:51,881
MATT: And they turn around and start walking their
way back to the center of Vesrah. Some of the kids

2246
02:35:51,881 --> 02:35:55,376
looking over their shoulders, kind of waiting to
see what you're going to do. Adella is waiting

2247
02:35:55,376 --> 02:35:57,269
there at the ship,

2248
02:35:57,269 --> 02:36:02,095
"All right, so, what's the plan?"

2249
02:36:02,095 --> 02:36:07,890
MARISHA: I mean, I totally could Tree Stride us
anywhere, but I kind of want to take the boat

2250
02:36:07,890 --> 02:36:08,983
again.

2251
02:36:08,983 --> 02:36:10,972
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're getting all our
money's worth out of the boat.

2252
02:36:10,972 --> 02:36:12,662
MARISHA: Yeah, we paid a lot, yeah.

2253
02:36:12,662 --> 02:36:15,030
TRAVIS: What are we gonna do?

2254
02:36:15,030 --> 02:36:16,089
MARISHA: To Emon for now?

2255
02:36:16,089 --> 02:36:23,097
LIAM: Well, Hotis is going to come for Pickle and
I at some point, but we need to do a little more

2256
02:36:23,097 --> 02:36:25,428
homework this time.

2257
02:36:25,428 --> 02:36:30,279
LAURA: Where can we study? The Cobalt Reserve? Is
it still standing at all in Emon?

2258
02:36:30,279 --> 02:36:31,524
Are there any books left?

2259
02:36:31,524 --> 02:36:32,518
MARISHA: We can go see.

2260
02:36:32,518 --> 02:36:33,473
LIAM: Gotta go to the liberry.

2261
02:36:33,473 --> 02:36:34,335
LAURA: Yeah.

2262
02:36:34,335 --> 02:36:38,270
MARISHA: We also haven't looked at any of the
findings from Raishan's cave.

2263
02:36:38,270 --> 02:36:38,979
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.

2264
02:36:38,979 --> 02:36:39,855
TALIESIN: No, not yet.

2265
02:36:39,855 --> 02:36:42,706
TRAVIS: Lots of books to read, real exciting.

2266
02:36:42,706 --> 02:36:47,217
MARISHA: Well, let's at least get back to Emon,
that's the main port town.

2267
02:36:47,217 --> 02:36:49,085
LAURA: Yeah.

2268
02:36:49,085 --> 02:36:50,281
LIAM: It's a starting point.

2269
02:36:50,281 --> 02:36:51,788
MARISHA: It's a starting point.

2270
02:36:51,788 --> 02:36:56,171
TALIESIN: We can also have them start looking at
the books while we're away, telling us if they

2271
02:36:56,171 --> 02:36:58,209
find anything of value.

2272
02:36:58,209 --> 02:37:03,514
LAURA: That's true. Probably need to start
studying Orcus as well.

2273
02:37:03,514 --> 02:37:05,235
TRAVIS: What?

2274
02:37:05,235 --> 02:37:09,706
LIAM: Orcas, orcas, after all of that under-sea--

2275
02:37:09,706 --> 02:37:10,996
LAURA: All those killer whales.

2276
02:37:10,996 --> 02:37:13,843
LIAM: -- struggle we need to be up to par.

2277
02:37:13,843 --> 02:37:15,869
TRAVIS: Ah, know our allies?

2278
02:37:15,869 --> 02:37:23,602
TALIESIN: There'll be time on the ship. Let's take
our time, before the Orcas.

2279
02:37:25,297 --> 02:37:30,483
MATT: All right. At this point Pike begins to
flicker.

2280
02:37:30,483 --> 02:37:31,755
LAURA: No!

2281
02:37:31,755 --> 02:37:33,560
ASHLEY: It's okay, I'll see you guys very soon.

2282
02:37:33,560 --> 02:37:34,819
LIAM: Jello shot, where you going?

2283
02:37:34,819 --> 02:37:35,630
LAURA: Back home?

2284
02:37:35,630 --> 02:37:37,427
ASHLEY: Yeah, back home. Jello shot? (laughs)

2285
02:37:37,427 --> 02:37:38,949
MARISHA: We're heading to Emon so we'll see you
there, okay?

2286
02:37:38,949 --> 02:37:40,539
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll see you soon--

2287
02:37:40,539 --> 02:37:41,525
TRAVIS: Wait, quick squeeze!

2288
02:37:41,525 --> 02:37:43,231
ASHLEY: Quick squeeze!

2289
02:37:43,231 --> 02:37:45,365
MATT: And she vanishes in your grasp.

2290
02:37:45,365 --> 02:37:49,169
TRAVIS: Ah, no! Ahh!

2291
02:37:49,169 --> 02:37:52,709
MARISHA: No, no, no, she's okay.

2292
02:37:52,709 --> 02:37:53,645
SAM: No, no, no.

2293
02:37:53,645 --> 02:37:54,809
LAURA: No, no, she's okay, she's fine.

2294
02:37:54,809 --> 02:37:58,029
LIAM: Twin on each arm pulling.

2295
02:37:58,029 --> 02:37:59,126
MATT: It's not enough.

2296
02:37:59,126 --> 02:38:00,770
TALIESIN: It'll be fine, he's just going to make
himself pass out, it'll be just fine.

2297
02:38:00,770 --> 02:38:01,732
MARISHA: True.

2298
02:38:01,732 --> 02:38:03,524
LIAM: Percy, get over here and pull!

2299
02:38:03,524 --> 02:38:05,606
TALIESIN: I want to see, let him sleep it off.

2300
02:38:05,606 --> 02:38:07,223
MARISHA: Just let him sleep, let him sleep it
off.

2301
02:38:07,223 --> 02:38:12,051
TRAVIS: (wails)

2302
02:38:12,051 --> 02:38:16,215
MATT: You guys make your way onto the ship with
Captain Adella at the helm, the boat turns around,

2303
02:38:16,215 --> 02:38:26,458
navigates the thin pathway between these exterior
reefs, and eventually to the open seas of Ozmit.

2304
02:38:26,511 --> 02:38:32,534
MARISHA: I-- if you're interested, Adella, because
I'm feeling pretty spiffy after--

2305
02:38:32,534 --> 02:38:37,882
MATT: She's holding onto the wheel like, "You
worry me already."

2306
02:38:37,882 --> 02:38:45,485
MARISHA: Okay, all right, I can control the winds
and give us forwards-facing winds for a solid hour

2307
02:38:45,485 --> 02:38:50,840
if you want. You want it? You want a little, turn
this into a speed boat? You know? See how fast it

2308
02:38:50,840 --> 02:38:54,721
goes? I don't know what this means, I've just seen
other sailors do it so.

2309
02:38:54,721 --> 02:39:00,672
TRAVIS: In a lot of countries it means one thing,
especially when sailors do it.

2310
02:39:00,672 --> 02:39:04,234
MATT: "Be my guest."

2311
02:39:04,234 --> 02:39:11,897
MARISHA: Okay, I cast fifth-level Control Winds.
I'm going to do just a solid gust behind us for a

2312
02:39:11,897 --> 02:39:13,081
good hour.

2313
02:39:13,081 --> 02:39:17,241
MATT: Okay, and with this consistently used, you
guys can cut about

2314
02:39:17,241 --> 02:39:18,819
half of the travel time back to Emon.

2315
02:39:18,819 --> 02:39:20,012
TRAVIS: Nice.

2316
02:39:20,012 --> 02:39:23,589
MATT: So what would normally be, depending on
weather, like five, six, seven days,

2317
02:39:23,589 --> 02:39:24,872
you get there in three.

2318
02:39:24,872 --> 02:39:26,302
LAURA: Nice.

2319
02:39:26,302 --> 02:39:29,910
MATT: Through the use of that, your general
Control Weather abilities and stuff-- it's pretty

2320
02:39:29,910 --> 02:39:36,795
fantastic. Thinking in the back of your head as
you travel that while you've completed your

2321
02:39:36,795 --> 02:39:42,821
Aramente, it is not done, you still have to return
to complete your Aramente. You guys eventually

2322
02:39:42,821 --> 02:39:49,617
find your way, coming into the docks on the
western side of Emon, the city still in the throes

2323
02:39:49,617 --> 02:39:56,369
of rebuilding, restructuring, it's busy, people
are returning, flocking to the streets. It's very

2324
02:39:56,369 --> 02:40:05,463
warm and welcoming to come back to a city that is
coming to life again. Where the grim reality

2325
02:40:05,463 --> 02:40:12,912
post-Thordak's fall has now been replaced with, it
seems to be a vibrant, buzzing energy of recovery

2326
02:40:12,912 --> 02:40:20,028
and moving forward. This still is the central city
of Tal'Dorei, and the people who have returned to

2327
02:40:20,028 --> 02:40:26,656
this are bringing it back as soon as they can to
the splendor it once held, being the jewel city of

2328
02:40:26,656 --> 02:40:33,706
this continent. You guys, after docking Adella and
the crew, which I can't recall,

2329
02:40:33,706 --> 02:40:35,314
did you pay them in advance?

2330
02:40:35,314 --> 02:40:36,145
LAURA: Mm-hm.

2331
02:40:36,145 --> 02:40:37,955
MATT: Great.

2332
02:40:37,955 --> 02:40:41,265
LAURA: No, I'm sure I did, marked it down, so.

2333
02:40:41,466 --> 02:40:42,524
MATT: I'm pretty sure you did.

2334
02:40:42,524 --> 02:40:50,846
LAURA: Oh no, I didn't, because we had decided on
150 gold per day. So, we went back quicker than we

2335
02:40:50,846 --> 02:40:54,703
thought so three days back, five days there?

2336
02:40:54,703 --> 02:40:55,697
MATT: Mm-hm.

2337
02:40:55,697 --> 02:40:57,385
LAURA: And then how many days were we in--

2338
02:40:57,385 --> 02:40:59,375
MATT: Technically, two.

2339
02:40:59,375 --> 02:41:00,311
TALIESIN: Two.

2340
02:41:00,311 --> 02:41:01,630
MATT: One, two nights in Vesrah.

2341
02:41:01,630 --> 02:41:06,950
LAURA: So ten? So just over 1,000 gold, that's
good.

2342
02:41:06,950 --> 02:41:09,903
SAM: I'll take care of it.

2343
02:41:09,903 --> 02:41:11,863
LAURA: Are you going to write her an IOU?

2344
02:41:11,863 --> 02:41:15,349
SAM: No, I'll pay her in gold.

2345
02:41:15,349 --> 02:41:17,154
LAURA: Taryon, really?

2346
02:41:17,154 --> 02:41:21,664
SAM: I hired you all, it's only the right thing,
Vex.

2347
02:41:21,664 --> 02:41:27,824
LAURA: Wow. Thank you, Taryon.

2348
02:41:27,824 --> 02:41:30,162
SAM: I'm a man of my word.

2349
02:41:30,162 --> 02:41:34,219
LAURA: I'm going to stand by your side as you pay
her.

2350
02:41:34,219 --> 02:41:39,019
MATT: Captain Adella's there with her crew behind
her. "It's been an absolute pleasure. Should you

2351
02:41:39,019 --> 02:41:42,170
"require our assistance again, you know where to
find us, and if not, we're busy making money

2352
02:41:42,170 --> 02:41:44,479
"elsewhere, fuck off."

2353
02:41:46,234 --> 02:41:48,121
SAM: 1,500?

2354
02:41:49,871 --> 02:41:53,381
MATT: She takes the coin purse from you.

2355
02:41:53,381 --> 02:41:55,601
SAM: Plus 150 tip.

2356
02:41:55,601 --> 02:41:59,262
MATT: Takes that, hands it to one of her-- her
first mate--

2357
02:41:59,262 --> 02:42:02,460
SAM: Plus 200 for any damages to your ship.

2358
02:42:03,590 --> 02:42:09,341
MATT: "It was quite damaged." Passes it off to her
first mate again and you can see the first mate is

2359
02:42:09,341 --> 02:42:13,019
kind of the sheepish mousy gentleman who is
currently in process of counting all the coins as

2360
02:42:13,019 --> 02:42:20,574
they come in, he's, like, the on-board accountant
and he's just-- "We're good." "Wonderful. Thank

2361
02:42:20,574 --> 02:42:28,752
"you so much for your patronage. Wish you all a
fond farewell. Now shoo."

2362
02:42:29,835 --> 02:42:34,822
LAURA: Taryon, thank you.

2363
02:42:34,822 --> 02:42:39,872
SAM: It's a pleasure doing business with you.

2364
02:42:40,341 --> 02:42:42,312
LAURA: All right.

2365
02:42:42,312 --> 02:42:47,024
MATT: You guys head into the city, and with each
street corner there's another building with a roof

2366
02:42:47,024 --> 02:42:53,315
that's being re-roofed. You can see walls being
re-stoned and structured. You can see carts being

2367
02:42:53,315 --> 02:42:59,175
brought in from the docks as trade has now begun
anew within the city, and there is a semblance of

2368
02:42:59,175 --> 02:43:06,273
culture, life and society continuing to still
re-emerge and spread with each visit to the city,

2369
02:43:06,273 --> 02:43:12,646
and it's very heartwarming and harkening to the
good that you've done through the struggles and

2370
02:43:12,646 --> 02:43:15,353
challenges leading up to this time.

2371
02:43:15,944 --> 02:43:21,422
LIAM: I'm sorry, old man, who's in charge here
these days?

2372
02:43:21,422 --> 02:43:23,627
MATT: "In charge of what?"

2373
02:43:23,627 --> 02:43:26,332
LIAM: The city? Who's running things?

2374
02:43:26,332 --> 02:43:28,430
MATT: "Oh, the Council."

2375
02:43:28,430 --> 02:43:30,273
LIAM: They're doing all right?

2376
02:43:30,273 --> 02:43:31,710
MATT: "I think so?"

2377
02:43:31,710 --> 02:43:35,190
LIAM: Okay, everything steady as she goes?

2378
02:43:35,190 --> 02:43:39,183
MATT: "I mean, my house is in ruins and I haven't
seen my grandchildren but--"

2379
02:43:39,183 --> 02:43:40,524
LAURA: Wow.

2380
02:43:40,524 --> 02:43:42,529
SAM: (laughs) Jesus.

2381
02:43:42,529 --> 02:43:45,143
TALIESIN: Well, that was English, well done.

2382
02:43:49,834 --> 02:43:52,119
MATT: "Could I?"

2383
02:43:52,170 --> 02:43:53,664
TALIESIN: That was the most English thing I've
ever seen in my life.

2384
02:43:53,664 --> 02:43:56,535
LIAM: Sure thing, Grandfather.

2385
02:43:56,535 --> 02:44:00,647
MATT: "Good day to you." Then he just wanders
off.

2386
02:44:00,647 --> 02:44:11,533
LAURA: Can I just pull Keyleth aside as we come on
land? And just say, I was very impressed with you.

2387
02:44:12,384 --> 02:44:24,518
For a long time, I've harbored a bit of doubt, I'm
sorry to say, and when you brought us away from

2388
02:44:24,518 --> 02:44:40,445
the kraken, I was very angry and very fearful. But
you've proven yourself, so much,

2389
02:44:40,445 --> 02:44:45,331
and I want to say I'm sorry.

2390
02:44:49,240 --> 02:44:55,958
MARISHA: There's no need for an apology. Just, you
being there means everything.

2391
02:44:55,958 --> 02:45:00,125
LAURA: I believe in you.

2392
02:45:00,125 --> 02:45:09,525
MARISHA: That means a lot, coming from you,
because I think you're just the coolest. I'm sorry

2393
02:45:09,525 --> 02:45:16,803
if I ever put you or your brother in harm's way.
Or anyone else.

2394
02:45:16,803 --> 02:45:22,322
LAURA: We all did it willingly. He especially.

2395
02:45:22,322 --> 02:45:34,132
MARISHA: Well. Thank you. What now?

2396
02:45:34,132 --> 02:45:40,704
LAURA: Well, we still have some things to take
care of. We have a crown to get on your head. I

2397
02:45:40,704 --> 02:45:43,531
can't believe you're going to be royalty.
Royalty-royalty.

2398
02:45:43,531 --> 02:45:45,112
MARISHA: Royalty's a strong word.

2399
02:45:45,112 --> 02:45:46,989
LAURA: Rule royalty. That's pretty fucking cool,
Keyleth.

2400
02:45:46,989 --> 02:45:51,380
MARISHA: Well, you're pretty cool yourself.

2401
02:45:51,380 --> 02:45:53,732
LAURA: Ah, well.

2402
02:45:53,732 --> 02:45:58,912
MARISHA: All Grand Mistress Nightwatch. What's it
called? Whatever.

2403
02:45:58,912 --> 02:46:00,183
TALIESIN: I'm not helping.

2404
02:46:00,183 --> 02:46:02,631
(all laugh)

2405
02:46:02,631 --> 02:46:12,018
LAURA: Keyleth. I'm glad my brother found you. I'm
glad we all found you.

2406
02:46:12,018 --> 02:46:15,570
MARISHA: I'm glad I found you guys.

2407
02:46:15,570 --> 02:46:17,995
LAURA: Love-love.

2408
02:46:17,995 --> 02:46:24,238
MARISHA: Learned a lot from you, so thank you. She
winked at me again.

2409
02:46:25,884 --> 02:46:33,250
MATT: As you guys make your way through the city
towards the temple district of Emon, you find your

2410
02:46:33,250 --> 02:46:38,522
way to the temple of Sarenrae, and as you begin to
step on the outside, the door's already open, and

2411
02:46:38,522 --> 02:46:42,303
knowingly awaiting, Pike steps out with a smile to
greet you.

2412
02:46:42,379 --> 02:46:47,515
(all cheer)

2413
02:46:47,515 --> 02:46:56,276
ASHLEY: It's okay! I just disappeared 'cause I was
in the shimmery. I was the cotton candy. You

2414
02:46:56,276 --> 02:46:57,608
didn't hurt me at all.

2415
02:46:57,608 --> 02:46:59,344
TRAVIS: I like cotton candy.

2416
02:46:59,344 --> 02:47:00,426
ASHLEY: Yeah, but--

2417
02:47:00,426 --> 02:47:02,563
(all laugh)

2418
02:47:02,563 --> 02:47:08,645
ASHLEY: I shouldn't say-- I wasn't like that,
then.

2419
02:47:08,645 --> 02:47:12,254
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. I'm sorry if I hurt you.

2420
02:47:12,254 --> 02:47:13,745
ASHLEY: No, you didn't at all!

2421
02:47:13,745 --> 02:47:15,364
TRAVIS: Okay.

2422
02:47:15,364 --> 02:47:17,183
ASHLEY: I didn't even feel it.

2423
02:47:17,183 --> 02:47:18,990
TRAVIS: Wow, you are really getting strong.

2424
02:47:18,990 --> 02:47:19,970
ASHLEY: I just disappeared.

2425
02:47:19,970 --> 02:47:21,837
TRAVIS: Yeah. You distappeared.

2426
02:47:21,837 --> 02:47:24,863
(all laugh)

2427
02:47:24,863 --> 02:47:26,679
ASHLEY: Hi, everybody!

2428
02:47:26,679 --> 02:47:28,690
TALIESIN: Hand over a big pile of seashell
jewelry.

2429
02:47:28,690 --> 02:47:30,000
ASHLEY: What is this?

2430
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:31,634
TALIESIN: Now, there we are.

2431
02:47:31,634 --> 02:47:32,589
MARISHA: Now you can wear it.

2432
02:47:32,589 --> 02:47:37,335
ASHLEY: Oh, yes! Ooh.

2433
02:47:37,386 --> 02:47:39,397
TALIESIN: It fits, good. I was a little worried.

2434
02:47:39,449 --> 02:47:45,189
MARISHA: He spent the entire time on the boat
braiding macrame, it was crazy.

2435
02:47:45,189 --> 02:47:47,932
TALIESIN: I've only got the medium glasses right
now, so--

2436
02:47:47,932 --> 02:47:50,503
MARISHA: He's getting into beading, it's odd.

2437
02:47:50,503 --> 02:47:54,259
(all laugh)

2438
02:47:54,259 --> 02:47:55,813
ASHLEY: I give him a big hug.

2439
02:47:55,813 --> 02:47:57,985
TALIESIN: Everybody needs a hobby.

2440
02:47:57,985 --> 02:47:58,869
MARISHA: No, it's great.

2441
02:47:58,869 --> 02:48:00,041
TALIESIN: Macrame might be mine.

2442
02:48:00,041 --> 02:48:02,042
MATT: Pike runs up and gives you a big hug.

2443
02:48:02,042 --> 02:48:03,005
LIAM: Stress relief.

2444
02:48:03,005 --> 02:48:06,210
ASHLEY: I give him a big hug.

2445
02:48:06,210 --> 02:48:08,149
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2446
02:48:08,149 --> 02:48:09,749
ASHLEY: Hello, Tary.

2447
02:48:09,749 --> 02:48:17,797
SAM: Hello, Pike. In the flesh, this time. I hope
that you've seen that I've been

2448
02:48:17,797 --> 02:48:20,977
doing as you asked every night.

2449
02:48:22,892 --> 02:48:25,235
ASHLEY: Can I insight check him?

2450
02:48:25,235 --> 02:48:26,821
MATT: Go for it.

2451
02:48:26,821 --> 02:48:28,765
TALIESIN: Did we hear him say that?

2452
02:48:28,765 --> 02:48:30,083
MATT: Under his breath, yeah.

2453
02:48:30,083 --> 02:48:31,005
TALIESIN: Okay.

2454
02:48:31,005 --> 02:48:32,818
LAURA: I know, right?

2455
02:48:34,002 --> 02:48:36,164
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

2456
02:48:36,164 --> 02:48:37,504
SAM: Absolutely.

2457
02:48:37,504 --> 02:48:41,848
MATT: Yeah, telling the truth, straight up. There
is a look of genuine awe and fear in his eyes when

2458
02:48:41,848 --> 02:48:44,296
he looks at you.

2459
02:48:44,792 --> 02:48:50,005
ASHLEY: I'm very proud of you. You need to
continue until you know it by heart.

2460
02:48:50,005 --> 02:48:54,223
SAM: I think I've learned their first names at
least.

2461
02:48:54,223 --> 02:48:55,550
ASHLEY: I know.

2462
02:48:55,550 --> 02:48:57,268
(all laugh)

2463
02:48:57,268 --> 02:48:58,230
ASHLEY: You have.

2464
02:48:58,230 --> 02:48:59,484
TRAVIS: (deep voice) I know.

2465
02:48:59,484 --> 02:49:03,764
(all laugh)

2466
02:49:03,764 --> 02:49:08,311
SAM: Well. What do we do now, fellows?

2467
02:49:08,311 --> 02:49:09,797
MARISHA: To the keep?

2468
02:49:09,797 --> 02:49:10,981
LIAM: Yeah, you wanna see where we live?

2469
02:49:10,981 --> 02:49:12,738
LAURA: To the keep, we need to stop by the
library.

2470
02:49:12,738 --> 02:49:14,104
SAM: Sure, yes, absolutely.

2471
02:49:14,104 --> 02:49:15,594
LAURA: Yeah, let's go to Greyskull.

2472
02:49:15,594 --> 02:49:17,673
TALIESIN: Give you a place to put down your things
for a bit.

2473
02:49:17,673 --> 02:49:22,343
MARISHA: Do you have the papers with you that you
pulled from Raishan? Are those with us?

2474
02:49:22,343 --> 02:49:24,394
MATT: They're in the bag of holding.

2475
02:49:24,394 --> 02:49:25,544
MARISHA: I'll help you research those.

2476
02:49:25,544 --> 02:49:27,060
TALIESIN: Yeah, we'll do a bit of that.

2477
02:49:27,060 --> 02:49:28,238
MARISHA: All right.

2478
02:49:28,238 --> 02:49:29,691
MATT: So you guys make your way back to Greyskull
Keep--

2479
02:49:29,691 --> 02:49:32,068
TALIESIN: I'll show you the other workshop.

2480
02:49:32,141 --> 02:49:34,114
SAM: (gasps) Ooh, there's something I need to
tinker.

2481
02:49:34,114 --> 02:49:36,179
TALIESIN: Oh, good. I actually need to talk to you
about that.

2482
02:49:36,179 --> 02:49:40,102
MATT: Much to your joy, some of your original
servants have returned from Whitestone.

2483
02:49:40,102 --> 02:49:42,231
(all cheer)

2484
02:49:42,231 --> 02:49:44,266
LAURA: Yay! Who all came back?

2485
02:49:44,266 --> 02:49:47,521
MATT: You do see within there, Laina and Erwin--

2486
02:49:47,521 --> 02:49:48,353
LIAM: Holy shit!

2487
02:49:48,353 --> 02:49:51,254
LAURA: I was so worried about them!

2488
02:49:51,254 --> 02:49:55,716
MATT: Laina greets you as you come up, she's like,
"Oh goodness me, it's been so long, all of you.

2489
02:49:55,716 --> 02:50:00,218
"Well, come in, it's so good to see you. Well, as
you were wandering about, we were all just keeping

2490
02:50:00,218 --> 02:50:06,491
"it down over there in Whitestone, but it's so nice
to be back. This place, it needs some work. Please

2491
02:50:06,491 --> 02:50:10,380
"don't be judging, I'm trying to clean as best I
can!" And the place looks pretty good, based on

2492
02:50:10,380 --> 02:50:13,562
the last time you saw it, but there's still dust
gathered around. She looks genuinely nervous, her

2493
02:50:13,562 --> 02:50:15,392
hair's kind of wracked.

2494
02:50:15,392 --> 02:50:17,136
LAURA: You're doing a great job.

2495
02:50:17,136 --> 02:50:19,866
LIAM: We're all a bit of a work in progress, it's
fine, dear.

2496
02:50:19,866 --> 02:50:20,837
LAURA: Yeah.

2497
02:50:20,837 --> 02:50:22,492
TALIESIN: That's very fair.

2498
02:50:22,492 --> 02:50:28,258
MATT: She turns and Erwen comes up, you see him,
you know, the very very old halfling male with his

2499
02:50:28,258 --> 02:50:35,821
long gray ponytail. "And it is great to see all of
you once more."

2500
02:50:35,821 --> 02:50:36,595
MARISHA: Erwen!

2501
02:50:36,595 --> 02:50:38,959
LIAM: Erwen.

2502
02:50:39,373 --> 02:50:40,946
MARISHA: You're still alive!

2503
02:50:40,946 --> 02:50:42,901
TALIESIN: Yeah, how did you manage?

2504
02:50:42,901 --> 02:50:44,756
LIAM: We thought natural causes might, you know.

2505
02:50:44,756 --> 02:50:45,588
MARISHA: Yeah.

2506
02:50:45,588 --> 02:50:47,666
MATT: "Which was very possible, yes."

2507
02:50:47,718 --> 02:50:48,986
TRAVIS: Can I insight check him?

2508
02:50:48,986 --> 02:50:53,191
MATT: Yes, you may.

2509
02:50:53,191 --> 02:50:56,823
TRAVIS: 19. No, is that a natural 20? It's a
natural 20.

2510
02:50:56,823 --> 02:50:58,051
ASHLEY: That's a natural 20.

2511
02:50:58,051 --> 02:50:59,419
MARISHA: Yeah, Gil!

2512
02:50:59,419 --> 02:51:01,680
LAURA: Oh! He's coming over-- whispers about
Erwen.

2513
02:51:01,680 --> 02:51:02,968
SAM: He is dead. He is a dead man.

2514
02:51:02,968 --> 02:51:03,974
MARISHA: He's Hotis!

2515
02:51:03,974 --> 02:51:07,079
LIAM: He has consumption.

2516
02:51:07,511 --> 02:51:13,788
SAM: Guys, use the code 'lootcrate' to get 10% off
your monthly loot crate.

2517
02:51:14,903 --> 02:51:23,228
TRAVIS: Well, I reach and I grab the dwarven
thrower. Welcome back, you son of a bitch.

2518
02:51:23,228 --> 02:51:25,603
(all laugh)

2519
02:51:25,603 --> 02:51:27,841
LIAM: (Grog voice) And I crush him into jam.

2520
02:51:28,802 --> 02:51:37,388
MATT: "I must say, I greatly appreciate you all
being so quick in getting us out of that whole

2521
02:51:37,388 --> 02:51:45,361
"dragon mess. I was rightfully frightened for my
life. Anyway, I need to continue making your

2522
02:51:45,481 --> 02:51:49,589
"beds." And he slowly begins shuffling off towards
the stairway.

2523
02:51:49,589 --> 02:51:51,659
TALIESIN: Well.

2524
02:51:51,659 --> 02:51:52,706
MARISHA: Aw.

2525
02:51:52,706 --> 02:51:54,367
ASHLEY: I love him.

2526
02:51:54,367 --> 02:51:56,314
MARISHA: He's too good for us.

2527
02:51:56,314 --> 02:51:57,320
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2528
02:51:57,320 --> 02:51:58,531
TALIESIN: That is unexpected.

2529
02:51:58,531 --> 02:52:01,435
MARISHA: Yes, he's still alive.

2530
02:52:01,826 --> 02:52:04,927
SAM: So, this is your house?

2531
02:52:04,927 --> 02:52:06,307
LIAM: This is our keep, man.

2532
02:52:06,307 --> 02:52:08,285
MARISHA: Yes! This is where we would have dinner.

2533
02:52:08,285 --> 02:52:09,268
TALIESIN: It's more of a summer home.

2534
02:52:09,268 --> 02:52:13,763
MARISHA: Oh! And that's a giant portrait of one of
our members who you haven't met, he made it riding

2535
02:52:13,763 --> 02:52:20,817
on a unicorn. It's great. You should show him the
basement.

2536
02:52:20,817 --> 02:52:23,363
TALIESIN: Oh no, we're going to get there, but I
figure we give him the full tour.

2537
02:52:23,363 --> 02:52:25,493
TRAVIS: Are we gonna tell him the fucking name or
what?

2538
02:52:25,493 --> 02:52:27,595
LAURA: Yeah, it's Greyskull Keep.

2539
02:52:27,595 --> 02:52:28,657
LIAM: Fool.

2540
02:52:28,657 --> 02:52:29,918
SAM: That's a really cool name.

2541
02:52:29,918 --> 02:52:31,667
LAURA: I know, right?

2542
02:52:31,667 --> 02:52:34,526
SAM: Wow. That's excellent!

2543
02:52:34,526 --> 02:52:36,453
TALIESIN: I've been thinking about redecorating.

2544
02:52:36,453 --> 02:52:38,933
SAM: Have you lived here very long, because
there's--

2545
02:52:38,933 --> 02:52:40,766
TRAVIS: It's on and off.

2546
02:52:40,766 --> 02:52:42,515
TALIESIN: Well, summer home really.

2547
02:52:42,515 --> 02:52:43,792
LAURA: Unfortunately, not too long.

2548
02:52:43,792 --> 02:52:46,420
LIAM: We've been vacationing from it for a while.

2549
02:52:46,420 --> 02:52:53,966
SAM: You might want to consider different keepers
of this place. It seems a bit--

2550
02:52:55,600 --> 02:52:57,664
LAURA: There were fucking dragons, Tary!

2551
02:52:57,664 --> 02:52:58,144
SAM: All right.

2552
02:52:58,144 --> 02:52:59,074
LAURA: Dragons!

2553
02:52:59,074 --> 02:53:00,555
SAM: You're right, it's just, I'm just not used
to-

2554
02:53:00,555 --> 02:53:04,863
TALIESIN: No, but if you have any input on decor
or otherwise, we would be interested.

2555
02:53:04,863 --> 02:53:07,276
SAM: Lots of murals, lots of tapestries.

2556
02:53:07,276 --> 02:53:08,674
TALIESIN: Oh, I would assume.

2557
02:53:08,674 --> 02:53:13,026
TRAVIS: Most of the murals are of one of our
friends, but yeah.

2558
02:53:13,026 --> 02:53:14,687
TALIESIN: We'll vary it up a bit.

2559
02:53:14,687 --> 02:53:18,934
LIAM: I don't know how long we're staying here,
but you can have my old room. You got a room.

2560
02:53:18,934 --> 02:53:20,386
SAM: Where will you sleep?

2561
02:53:20,386 --> 02:53:21,471
LAURA: (laughs)

2562
02:53:21,471 --> 02:53:22,757
TALIESIN: In my old room.

2563
02:53:22,757 --> 02:53:28,907
(all laugh)

2564
02:53:33,565 --> 02:53:37,857
SAM: All right, sure.

2565
02:53:37,857 --> 02:53:39,946
LAURA: This is ridiculous.

2566
02:53:39,946 --> 02:53:42,782
TALIESIN: It's good coffee today.

2567
02:53:42,782 --> 02:53:49,866
MATT: This is the second time Polymachina has come
up in our campaign? Taryon and the two guards in

2568
02:53:49,866 --> 02:53:56,085
Syngorn-- really confused. All right.

2569
02:53:56,259 --> 02:53:59,622
TALIESIN: And I'll definitely show him the
downstairs, and anytime you want to use the

2570
02:53:59,622 --> 02:54:03,727
workshop downstairs-- it's a bit thin at the
moment.

2571
02:54:03,727 --> 02:54:05,577
MATT: Yeah, most of the tools have been stolen.

2572
02:54:05,577 --> 02:54:08,486
SAM: Well, we'll have to go in town and buy some
replacements for you.

2573
02:54:08,486 --> 02:54:09,360
TALIESIN: Yes.

2574
02:54:09,360 --> 02:54:11,362
LIAM: You can make shit, though, what can you
make?

2575
02:54:11,362 --> 02:54:14,011
SAM: Anything I set my mind to, if I have enough
raw materials.

2576
02:54:14,011 --> 02:54:16,749
LIAM: Hats?

2577
02:54:16,749 --> 02:54:19,142
SAM: Sure. You need a hat?

2578
02:54:19,142 --> 02:54:20,682
TALIESIN: Invisibility?

2579
02:54:20,682 --> 02:54:24,931
SAM: Sure, I've done that before. I've given you
invisibility coins.

2580
02:54:24,931 --> 02:54:28,132
LIAM: Do you have a specialty? Do you do clothing,
or--

2581
02:54:28,132 --> 02:54:29,691
SAM: Anything alchemic.

2582
02:54:29,691 --> 02:54:31,702
TALIESIN: Teleportation?

2583
02:54:31,702 --> 02:54:36,624
SAM: I don't think I can do that, but anything
that combines a little bit of magic with a little

2584
02:54:36,624 --> 02:54:40,947
bit of engineering I can probably manage.

2585
02:54:40,947 --> 02:54:43,201
LIAM: What about a beard trimmer?

2586
02:54:43,201 --> 02:54:44,740
SAM: A beard trimmer?

2587
02:54:44,740 --> 02:54:45,535
LIAM: Yes.

2588
02:54:45,535 --> 02:54:46,296
TRAVIS: What?

2589
02:54:46,296 --> 02:54:47,299
LIAM: He's looking a little shaggy.

2590
02:54:47,299 --> 02:54:48,317
TALIESIN: Death has changed you.

2591
02:54:48,317 --> 02:54:54,378
SAM: Sure, that seems like an easy thing to do.
You seem pretty clean-shaven, though.

2592
02:54:54,378 --> 02:55:00,536
LIAM: Yeah, I don't grow thick. It's pretty
sparse, actually.

2593
02:55:00,536 --> 02:55:01,470
LAURA: What?

2594
02:55:01,470 --> 02:55:02,519
ASHLEY: Whoopsie.

2595
02:55:02,519 --> 02:55:03,341
LAURA: Uh.

2596
02:55:03,341 --> 02:55:04,528
TALIESIN: Oh.

2597
02:55:04,528 --> 02:55:05,966
LIAM: Dirty birds.

2598
02:55:05,966 --> 02:55:09,331
LAURA: I go to the library.

2599
02:55:09,331 --> 02:55:13,319
LIAM: Wait! Where're you going? I want to go to
the library. Yeah, beard trimmer.

2600
02:55:13,319 --> 02:55:14,288
SAM: I'm on it.

2601
02:55:14,288 --> 02:55:15,315
LIAM: I need a beard trimmer.

2602
02:55:15,315 --> 02:55:17,527
SAM: I'm on it, Vax.

2603
02:55:17,527 --> 02:55:21,349
TALIESIN: Feel free to restock whatever's missing.
Keyleth and I, I think at the very least, and

2604
02:55:21,349 --> 02:55:26,234
maybe anybody else who wants to go upstairs and
start poring through the wonderful private nooks

2605
02:55:26,234 --> 02:55:28,312
and crannies of the library, please.

2606
02:55:28,312 --> 02:55:30,648
TRAVIS: How are you going to do that, by the way?

2607
02:55:30,648 --> 02:55:31,530
TALIESIN: Nooks and crannies?

2608
02:55:31,530 --> 02:55:33,658
TRAVIS: Yeah, like, doesn't that require reading?

2609
02:55:33,658 --> 02:55:37,273
TALIESIN: I've got-- well, they're not very good,
are they?

2610
02:55:37,273 --> 02:55:39,345
TRAVIS: No, they're not, are they?

2611
02:55:39,345 --> 02:55:42,231
TALIESIN: Do I have any spare-- I don't have any
spare glasses, do I?

2612
02:55:42,231 --> 02:55:44,018
TRAVIS: What do you need?

2613
02:55:44,018 --> 02:55:45,586
TALIESIN: I think I need the glasses.

2614
02:55:45,586 --> 02:55:47,043
TRAVIS: What do you got?

2615
02:55:47,043 --> 02:55:56,177
TALIESIN: Hm.

2616
02:55:56,177 --> 02:55:58,632
LAURA: You already got his ascot, don't you?

2617
02:55:58,632 --> 02:56:00,907
TRAVIS: Yep.

2618
02:56:00,907 --> 02:56:03,663
TALIESIN: Let me think about that for a moment.
Carry on.

2619
02:56:03,663 --> 02:56:07,274
TRAVIS: Yep.

2620
02:56:07,274 --> 02:56:08,220
MATT: All right.

2621
02:56:08,220 --> 02:56:09,983
ASHLEY: Grog, did you steal Percy's glasses?

2622
02:56:09,983 --> 02:56:11,566
TRAVIS: No, he actually gave them to me.

2623
02:56:11,566 --> 02:56:12,554
ASHLEY: Oh!

2624
02:56:12,554 --> 02:56:18,752
TRAVIS: Yep. But I found out from Vex, that when
you trade, you get something in return and last

2625
02:56:18,752 --> 02:56:22,907
time, I got a title. Yep.

2626
02:56:22,907 --> 02:56:23,949
ASHLEY: You did?

2627
02:56:23,949 --> 02:56:26,865
TRAVIS: Yeah I'm the Grand Doopa Babink of All
Didedah.

2628
02:56:26,865 --> 02:56:29,944
(all laugh)

2629
02:56:29,944 --> 02:56:32,771
ASHLEY: That sounds fun.

2630
02:56:32,771 --> 02:56:39,780
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's a top secret title and it comes
with all the land and money,

2631
02:56:39,780 --> 02:56:40,949
and a bunch of short names.

2632
02:56:40,949 --> 02:56:42,428
TALIESIN: I'm very quickly going to craft
something super simple.

2633
02:56:42,428 --> 02:56:43,483
MATT: What're you crafting?

2634
02:56:43,483 --> 02:56:44,515
ASHLEY: Lands and money where?

2635
02:56:44,515 --> 02:56:45,817
TALIESIN: I want to make a little foil pinwheel
out of tin.

2636
02:56:45,817 --> 02:56:46,882
TRAVIS: I don't know. Probably everywhere.

2637
02:56:46,882 --> 02:56:47,940
MATT: Yeah. Make a tinkering check.

2638
02:56:47,940 --> 02:56:49,087
ASHLEY: I always knew you were royalty.

2639
02:56:49,087 --> 02:56:50,236
LAURA: (laughs)

2640
02:56:50,236 --> 02:56:51,532
TALIESIN: It's proficiency plus dex?

2641
02:56:51,532 --> 02:56:52,703
MATT: Yeah.

2642
02:56:52,703 --> 02:56:56,955
TALIESIN: I can never remember. Well, you know,
that's probably good enough. Let's see. 18?

2643
02:56:56,955 --> 02:56:58,910
MATT: You just didn't roll a one.

2644
02:56:58,910 --> 02:56:59,954
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2645
02:56:59,954 --> 02:57:04,381
MATT: You're fine. Yeah, you produce a-- with what
little materials you have there-- raw materials

2646
02:57:04,381 --> 02:57:06,148
left, you happily do so.

2647
02:57:06,148 --> 02:57:12,260
TALIESIN: I have made a tiny pinwheel. It spins.
And it's made of metal.

2648
02:57:12,260 --> 02:57:14,424
MARISHA: I do a little gust cantrip to blow it.

2649
02:57:14,424 --> 02:57:17,854
TALIESIN: And I put it on your lapel or your
little strap that counts as a--

2650
02:57:17,854 --> 02:57:20,688
I just put it in a belt loop.

2651
02:57:20,688 --> 02:57:22,009
ASHLEY: That's the cutest thing.

2652
02:57:22,009 --> 02:57:24,227
TRAVIS: Am I a fucking child?

2653
02:57:24,227 --> 02:57:29,514
TALIESIN: Now you know if there's wind blowing.
This is what I had I'm really like-- I'll give the

2654
02:57:29,514 --> 02:57:32,470
glasses back when I'm done with them. This is a
rental charge.

2655
02:57:32,470 --> 02:57:38,368
TRAVIS: Because of my high office, I will forgive
this offense. Come back when you're serious. Cloak

2656
02:57:38,368 --> 02:57:43,096
of smashing, title, whatever. I'm sure you're very
smart. You'll think of something.

2657
02:57:43,258 --> 02:57:45,320
MARISHA: You want another title?

2658
02:57:45,490 --> 02:57:47,246
TRAVIS: I'll keep this as a deposit though.

2659
02:57:47,246 --> 02:57:51,811
(all laugh)

2660
02:57:51,811 --> 02:57:55,251
TALIESIN: Shit.

2661
02:57:55,251 --> 02:57:58,239
MARISHA: Just give him another title.

2662
02:57:58,239 --> 02:58:00,964
TALIESIN: Oh dear.

2663
02:58:03,863 --> 02:58:07,444
MATT: All right, so you guys go to the library.
What're you looking for specifically?

2664
02:58:08,240 --> 02:58:11,093
LAURA: What're we doing? Researching something.
Hotis? And like the Nine Hells.

2665
02:58:11,093 --> 02:58:11,991
LIAM: Hell.

2666
02:58:11,991 --> 02:58:13,298
MATT: Investigation check.

2667
02:58:13,298 --> 02:58:14,943
LIAM: Orcus?

2668
02:58:14,943 --> 02:58:20,541
LAURA: All of it. Ooh! 26!

2669
02:58:20,541 --> 02:58:21,570
LIAM: Which one are we doing?

2670
02:58:21,570 --> 02:58:22,388
LAURA: Investigation.

2671
02:58:22,388 --> 02:58:23,374
LIAM: Investigation?

2672
02:58:23,374 --> 02:58:25,330
TALIESIN: I'm just going to help with the spines
of books at this point.

2673
02:58:25,330 --> 02:58:26,084
LIAM: 23.

2674
02:58:26,084 --> 02:58:26,828
MATT: Okay.

2675
02:58:26,828 --> 02:58:27,505
LIAM: Damn it!

2676
02:58:27,505 --> 02:58:29,185
MARISHA: Yeah I'll do the reading for Percy until
he gets his glasses back.

2677
02:58:29,185 --> 02:58:36,598
MATT: There you go. You're hard-pressed to find
anything in your library that gets very specific.

2678
02:58:36,598 --> 02:58:44,094
There are mythological mentions of the Nine Hells,
of multiple layers, of demon princes. But the

2679
02:58:44,094 --> 02:58:49,416
books that you have at your disposal largely speak
about them like a fairy tale. Or talk about

2680
02:58:49,416 --> 02:58:55,907
historical mentions of them through the history of
Exandria, of the betrayer gods, and the old age of

2681
02:58:55,907 --> 02:59:00,612
arcanum days. But nothing specifically about the
hells. So even with the research, you just don't

2682
02:59:00,612 --> 02:59:03,483
have those books in the keep.

2683
02:59:03,853 --> 02:59:06,237
LAURA: We got to go somewhere better.

2684
02:59:06,237 --> 02:59:10,036
LIAM: Vasselheim. Isn't there a library there?

2685
02:59:10,036 --> 02:59:13,107
LAURA: There's a library here. The Cobalt Reserve.
It was just kind of smashed, but I wonder if

2686
02:59:13,107 --> 02:59:14,346
there's still books there.

2687
02:59:14,346 --> 02:59:15,390
LIAM: Is it blown to shit?

2688
02:59:15,390 --> 02:59:16,521
MATT: The Cobalt Reserve is in Westruun.

2689
02:59:16,521 --> 02:59:17,963
LAURA: Just kidding. It's in Westruun.

2690
02:59:17,963 --> 02:59:22,941
MATT: But it is essentially the largest collection
of the most dense and

2691
02:59:22,941 --> 02:59:24,312
sacred books on the continent.

2692
02:59:24,312 --> 02:59:25,698
LIAM: Hey, that's a good idea you just had.

2693
02:59:25,698 --> 02:59:26,498
LAURA: Hey!

2694
02:59:26,498 --> 02:59:27,361
LIAM: In Westruun.

2695
02:59:27,361 --> 02:59:29,668
LAURA: I was just wrong about, yeah, the city.
That's it.

2696
02:59:29,668 --> 02:59:31,254
LIAM: Well shit, all right.

2697
02:59:31,254 --> 02:59:32,491
LAURA: What do you think?

2698
02:59:32,491 --> 02:59:37,251
LIAM: Well, I don't think we should go charging
into the Nine Hells like we did the ocean.

2699
02:59:37,251 --> 02:59:39,712
LAURA: No. (laughs)

2700
02:59:39,712 --> 02:59:42,247
TALIESIN: When you put it like that.

2701
02:59:42,247 --> 02:59:46,039
LIAM: Yeah, let's try to prepare better.

2702
02:59:46,039 --> 02:59:47,043
LAURA: Shall we go to Westruun?

2703
02:59:47,043 --> 02:59:48,287
LIAM: Yeah. Maybe not today.

2704
02:59:48,287 --> 02:59:49,015
LAURA: No.

2705
02:59:49,015 --> 02:59:50,629
LIAM: We just got here. But yeah.

2706
02:59:50,629 --> 02:59:51,834
LAURA: That's where we'll go to?

2707
02:59:51,834 --> 02:59:53,024
TRAVIS: Yep.

2708
02:59:53,024 --> 02:59:54,720
LAURA: Yeah? Tight? Tight?

2709
02:59:54,720 --> 02:59:58,087
TALIESIN: A'ight.

2710
02:59:58,087 --> 03:00:01,208
MARISHA: We're reading papers from Raishan's.

2711
03:00:01,269 --> 03:00:02,513
TALIESIN: Also, yeah.

2712
03:00:02,513 --> 03:00:07,124
MATT: So you're pulling some of the notes you had
gathered-- what languages do you guys speak?

2713
03:00:07,365 --> 03:00:09,101
MARISHA: I speak Primordial.

2714
03:00:09,101 --> 03:00:10,120
MATT: Speak or read.

2715
03:00:10,120 --> 03:00:11,828
MARISHA: And, well.

2716
03:00:11,828 --> 03:00:14,867
TALIESIN: High-school Spanish.

2717
03:00:14,867 --> 03:00:17,670
MARISHA: Primordial, Druidic, Sylvan, Elven.

2718
03:00:17,670 --> 03:00:19,397
TALIESIN: Common, Celestial, Elven.

2719
03:00:19,397 --> 03:00:20,292
MATT: Right.

2720
03:00:20,292 --> 03:00:22,000
LAURA: Draconic, Abyssal.

2721
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:26,525
MATT: Most of these notes you cannot read. The
language you've-- Percival, you recognize the

2722
03:00:26,525 --> 03:00:28,842
script. A lot of them are written in Abyssal.

2723
03:00:28,842 --> 03:00:29,925
TALIESIN: All right.

2724
03:00:29,925 --> 03:00:31,011
LAURA: I can read Abyssal.

2725
03:00:31,011 --> 03:00:33,996
LIAM: We read Abyssal, we studied it in school.

2726
03:00:33,996 --> 03:00:35,945
MATT: Right, so do you go and call their help?

2727
03:00:35,945 --> 03:00:40,211
TALIESIN: Who reads Abyssal? I can't-- who reads
at all. This is all out of focus.

2728
03:00:40,211 --> 03:00:41,361
LAURA: I read Abyssal.

2729
03:00:41,361 --> 03:00:43,137
LIAM: Oh, do you need help reading a book,
Percival?

2730
03:00:43,137 --> 03:00:46,196
LAURA: Do you need help because we both speak
Abyssal?

2731
03:00:46,196 --> 03:00:49,161
MARISHA: Grog stole his glasses, go easy on him.

2732
03:00:49,161 --> 03:00:50,308
SAM: That's cool.

2733
03:00:50,308 --> 03:00:51,717
TRAVIS: I did not steal. They were a gift.

2734
03:00:51,717 --> 03:00:55,827
LIAM: Excuse, me but this is a once-in-a-lifetime
moment for me.

2735
03:00:55,827 --> 03:00:57,190
TALIESIN: Are you enjoying yourself?

2736
03:00:57,190 --> 03:00:58,206
LIAM: Do you-- immensely.

2737
03:00:58,206 --> 03:01:02,143
TALIESIN: This is my gift to you. Happy
Rebirthday.

2738
03:01:02,143 --> 03:01:06,051
LIAM: Thank you, Freddie. Have a seat, let me
translate for you.

2739
03:01:06,051 --> 03:01:09,546
And a very merry Unbirthday to you.

2740
03:01:09,546 --> 03:01:13,607
TALIESIN: I'm glad I let Grog hit you 'cause I
know it hurt more.

2741
03:01:13,607 --> 03:01:21,538
MATT: All right, so you glance through some of the
notes that were gathered. A lot of them appear to

2742
03:01:21,538 --> 03:01:33,139
be almost gibberish in the order of words. They
don't make sense. Or at least--

2743
03:01:33,139 --> 03:01:38,089
LIAM: In Abyssal, the verb goes at the end of the
sentence, which is different than in Common. You

2744
03:01:38,089 --> 03:01:41,146
might not have known that.

2745
03:01:41,146 --> 03:01:50,861
MATT: You do make up some of them are historical
discussions on the roots of powerful magic.

2746
03:01:50,861 --> 03:02:00,479
Elements during the founding, they're mentioned a
few times. They speak of the original Titans, it's

2747
03:02:00,479 --> 03:02:09,276
a lot of very similarly and type-dense scattered
notes. Some of the books that you pull are

2748
03:02:09,330 --> 03:02:15,333
specifically arcane spellbooks, but they're also
written in Abyssal. And as neither of you are

2749
03:02:15,394 --> 03:02:20,129
practitioners of arcane magic, you have no idea
what they say, you just recognize them to be sort

2750
03:02:20,129 --> 03:02:21,842
of spell markings.

2751
03:02:21,842 --> 03:02:23,363
LIAM: That's some bullshit.

2752
03:02:23,363 --> 03:02:25,036
MARISHA: Don't say those things out loud.

2753
03:02:25,036 --> 03:02:28,487
MATT: There is the one large dark leather tome
that is still locked on the side, and that was

2754
03:02:28,487 --> 03:02:29,697
what was on the--

2755
03:02:29,697 --> 03:02:33,316
LAURA: Right. That one feels, is like super
scary-looking, though, right?

2756
03:02:33,316 --> 03:02:40,058
MATT: Of all the books, it looks like probably the
premium book of Opash's collection.

2757
03:02:40,058 --> 03:02:44,419
LAURA: Does it have writing on the cover?

2758
03:02:44,419 --> 03:02:53,477
MATT: It has no writing on the cover. It is just a
dark black, leather-bound tome roughly that big

2759
03:02:53,477 --> 03:02:59,195
that looks like it's weathered, scratched in
places. It has kind of like a deep, metallic

2760
03:02:59,195 --> 03:03:01,181
cornered trimmed bits to it.

2761
03:03:01,181 --> 03:03:05,322
LAURA: But Gilmore looked at that. I had Gilmore
look at it and he said it was scary.

2762
03:03:05,322 --> 03:03:12,249
MATT: He said whoever decides to read it should be
strong of will. That was his warning.

2763
03:03:12,249 --> 03:03:13,860
LAURA: Right.

2764
03:03:13,860 --> 03:03:20,428
TALIESIN: Yeah, a lock on a book is one of those
universal titles that make sense in any language.

2765
03:03:20,428 --> 03:03:21,426
LAURA: Question.

2766
03:03:21,426 --> 03:03:22,161
MATT: Yes?

2767
03:03:22,161 --> 03:03:25,373
LAURA: DM? What would will-- is that wisdom?

2768
03:03:25,373 --> 03:03:26,394
MATT: That's like wisdom modifier.

2769
03:03:26,394 --> 03:03:27,207
LAURA: Okay.

2770
03:03:27,207 --> 03:03:29,276
MATT: Generally, like wisdom saving throw. That's
generally the kind of

2771
03:03:29,276 --> 03:03:30,956
willpower tests elements of it.

2772
03:03:30,956 --> 03:03:34,523
LIAM: Did Shaun say to read it or to open it, do
we remember?

2773
03:03:34,523 --> 03:03:36,432
LAURA: He said whoever read it had to be careful.

2774
03:03:36,432 --> 03:03:37,431
MATT: Read it.

2775
03:03:37,431 --> 03:03:40,527
LIAM: Okay. Do I see any kind of trap to the
lock?

2776
03:03:40,527 --> 03:03:42,701
MATT: Investigation check.

2777
03:03:42,701 --> 03:03:44,576
TALIESIN: Are we going there?

2778
03:03:44,576 --> 03:03:45,766
LIAM: No, I'm just checking, I'm not opening it.

2779
03:03:45,766 --> 03:03:46,953
LAURA: Whoa! Pike should read it.

2780
03:03:46,953 --> 03:03:47,731
MATT: If you wish to.

2781
03:03:47,731 --> 03:03:48,587
LIAM: That's fine.

2782
03:03:48,587 --> 03:03:49,362
TRAVIS: Pike should read it.

2783
03:03:49,362 --> 03:03:50,748
LIAM: Perception you said? 22.

2784
03:03:50,748 --> 03:03:53,125
LAURA: Pike's got crazy wisdom, we should make her
look at it.

2785
03:03:53,125 --> 03:03:56,806
MATT: 22? It does not appear to be trapped, it is
locked though.

2786
03:03:56,806 --> 03:04:01,897
LIAM: Okay. I will-- do we want to crack this shit
open now?

2787
03:04:01,897 --> 03:04:03,131
TRAVIS: Yes! Absolutely.

2788
03:04:03,131 --> 03:04:04,636
LAURA: I mean, maybe Pike should look at it.

2789
03:04:04,636 --> 03:04:07,655
LIAM: Yeah, I'm not gonna fucking read it, I'm
just gonna open it for Pike.

2790
03:04:07,655 --> 03:04:09,769
MARISHA: Did you detect any traps?

2791
03:04:09,769 --> 03:04:11,424
LIAM: I didn't. Seems all right.

2792
03:04:11,424 --> 03:04:12,943
MARISHA: Can I do Detect Magic on it? Sorry.

2793
03:04:12,943 --> 03:04:14,532
SAM: Can I-- no, it's fine.

2794
03:04:14,532 --> 03:04:16,376
MATT: You've already been told that it's magical
from Gilmore earlier.

2795
03:04:16,376 --> 03:04:17,326
LAURA: Gilmore looked at it.

2796
03:04:17,326 --> 03:04:19,275
SAM: Can I cast Identify on the lock or
something?

2797
03:04:19,275 --> 03:04:20,381
LAURA: On the book?

2798
03:04:20,381 --> 03:04:21,832
LIAM: Or on the book.

2799
03:04:21,832 --> 03:04:31,704
MATT: That's essentially what Gilmore did. It's
not a magical item with abilities or powers. It

2800
03:04:31,704 --> 03:04:34,866
just has a magical essence to it and it's
ancient.

2801
03:04:35,495 --> 03:04:36,942
LAURA: We should have Pike look at this.

2802
03:04:36,942 --> 03:04:37,644
TRAVIS: Yup.

2803
03:04:37,644 --> 03:04:39,413
LAURA: Pike! Look at this.

2804
03:04:39,413 --> 03:04:40,528
LIAM: I'm gonna try to unlock it.

2805
03:04:40,528 --> 03:04:42,618
LAURA: Wait, wait, I just wanted to-- oh god.

2806
03:04:42,618 --> 03:04:43,961
MATT: All right, make a lock-picking check.

2807
03:04:43,961 --> 03:04:45,812
LIAM: Well no, is there anything you want to do,
Pike, before I open it?

2808
03:04:45,812 --> 03:04:48,997
LAURA: It's just a dark book, we found it in
Raishan, well in--

2809
03:04:48,997 --> 03:04:51,902
MATT: Opash's slash Thordak's lair.

2810
03:04:51,902 --> 03:04:53,132
LAURA: Opash's lair.

2811
03:04:53,132 --> 03:04:54,297
MARISHA: Slash Raishan's.

2812
03:04:54,297 --> 03:04:57,282
TALIESIN: It's a locked book of unspeakable evil.

2813
03:04:57,282 --> 03:04:59,710
LAURA: Gilmore said to be careful of it.

2814
03:04:59,710 --> 03:05:01,330
TRAVIS: It's made from, like, flesh?

2815
03:05:01,330 --> 03:05:03,755
SAM: Do you fellows think that it will explode, or
something bad, when we open it?

2816
03:05:03,755 --> 03:05:05,030
TALIESIN: Oh, god, if that's all--

2817
03:05:05,030 --> 03:05:07,003
LAURA: We're just sort of afraid it will take over
someone's mind or something.

2818
03:05:07,003 --> 03:05:07,859
MARISHA: Yeah.

2819
03:05:07,859 --> 03:05:09,167
SAM: Why don't we have Doty open it?

2820
03:05:09,167 --> 03:05:11,178
MARISHA: What's your will, Pike? Your wisdom?

2821
03:05:11,178 --> 03:05:13,338
TALIESIN: What's Doty's willpower?

2822
03:05:13,393 --> 03:05:15,201
SAM: I dunno, it doesn't matter. If he breaks,
I'll fix him.

2823
03:05:15,201 --> 03:05:17,970
ASHLEY: It would be considered saving-- you would
add your saving throw wisdom?

2824
03:05:17,970 --> 03:05:19,084
MATT: We'll find out.

2825
03:05:19,084 --> 03:05:20,343
LAURA: Ohh.

2826
03:05:20,343 --> 03:05:24,418
MARISHA: Can I assist Pike in some way since we're
both wise as fuck?

2827
03:05:24,418 --> 03:05:26,298
MATT: You guys could both attempt to read it
together and

2828
03:05:26,298 --> 03:05:28,923
you'd both have to possibly be tested.

2829
03:05:28,923 --> 03:05:29,969
ASHLEY: Tested?

2830
03:05:29,969 --> 03:05:30,968
MATT: That's your call.

2831
03:05:30,968 --> 03:05:31,824
SAM: Wow.

2832
03:05:31,824 --> 03:05:33,082
MARISHA: My saving throw modifier is plus 11.

2833
03:05:33,082 --> 03:05:34,131
LAURA: Pike is really, really wise.

2834
03:05:34,131 --> 03:05:34,810
SAM: Wow.

2835
03:05:34,810 --> 03:05:35,577
LIAM: All right, so, hold on a minute.

2836
03:05:35,577 --> 03:05:36,509
ASHLEY: Oh, shit.

2837
03:05:36,509 --> 03:05:37,451
MARISHA: -- and my regular modifier is plus six.

2838
03:05:37,451 --> 03:05:38,243
MATT: What are we doing?

2839
03:05:38,243 --> 03:05:41,082
LIAM: Hold on a minute. I'm gonna unlock it. I'm
not even gonna open it. I'm just gonna unlock it.

2840
03:05:41,082 --> 03:05:42,545
So I get between everybody and the book.

2841
03:05:42,545 --> 03:05:43,329
TRAVIS: Yep.

2842
03:05:43,329 --> 03:05:44,269
LAURA: Close your eyes as soon as you unlock it.

2843
03:05:44,269 --> 03:05:45,663
LIAM: Okay.

2844
03:05:45,663 --> 03:05:47,515
LAURA: (laughs)

2845
03:05:47,515 --> 03:05:53,753
LIAM: That is a-- That's fine. That's a 26.

2846
03:05:53,753 --> 03:05:56,625
MATT: It opens.

2847
03:05:56,625 --> 03:05:57,893
LIAM: Okay, hold on.

2848
03:05:57,893 --> 03:05:58,880
LAURA: I back away.

2849
03:05:58,880 --> 03:05:59,408
SAM: Ooh.

2850
03:05:59,408 --> 03:06:00,295
LIAM: Hold on.

2851
03:06:00,295 --> 03:06:01,039
MATT: The latch opens, not the book.

2852
03:06:01,039 --> 03:06:02,832
LIAM: Hold on. Keyleth, Pike, Vex, c'mere.

2853
03:06:02,832 --> 03:06:04,388
LAURA: I'm in the doorway, man.

2854
03:06:04,388 --> 03:06:05,540
TALIESIN: I can't read it anyway.

2855
03:06:05,540 --> 03:06:06,536
ASHLEY: We can do it.

2856
03:06:06,536 --> 03:06:07,591
MARISHA: I go up. I go up.

2857
03:06:07,591 --> 03:06:08,250
ASHLEY: We can do it together.

2858
03:06:08,250 --> 03:06:09,344
TRAVIS: Yeah, just you two.

2859
03:06:09,344 --> 03:06:10,094
MARISHA: I don't know, I don't know.

2860
03:06:10,094 --> 03:06:16,810
LIAM: I cast Bless on Pickle, on Keyleth, and my
twin's far away, so I guess on myself.

2861
03:06:16,810 --> 03:06:17,700
ASHLEY: What do we get?

2862
03:06:17,700 --> 03:06:19,123
LIAM: And then I step behind the girls--

2863
03:06:19,123 --> 03:06:20,371
LAURA: (laughs)

2864
03:06:20,371 --> 03:06:21,328
MATT: Okay.

2865
03:06:21,328 --> 03:06:22,356
LIAM: -- and watch.

2866
03:06:22,356 --> 03:06:24,851
MATT: All right. Who's doing what?

2867
03:06:24,851 --> 03:06:28,386
TRAVIS: Oh no, look at that face. Holy shit,
look--

2868
03:06:28,386 --> 03:06:30,242
LAURA: Oh no, what's that face? What's that face?

2869
03:06:30,242 --> 03:06:32,044
TRAVIS: Look at that forehead. That's like an F5
tornado rolling in.

2870
03:06:32,044 --> 03:06:34,215
SAM: Three people reading a book.

2871
03:06:34,215 --> 03:06:34,971
ASHLEY: Should we have Doty open it?

2872
03:06:34,971 --> 03:06:36,615
SAM: It doesn't get any more intense.

2873
03:06:36,615 --> 03:06:38,464
(all laugh)

2874
03:06:38,464 --> 03:06:39,501
MARISHA: This is what you tuned in for.

2875
03:06:39,501 --> 03:06:41,987
TRAVIS: Let's not turn this into burying the
shoebox. It's just a book, let's just read it.

2876
03:06:41,987 --> 03:06:46,162
ASHLEY: Should we have Doty look at it? We
wouldn't be able to tell.

2877
03:06:46,162 --> 03:06:47,181
TALIESIN: That didn't work out.

2878
03:06:47,181 --> 03:06:48,824
SAM: You seem much more powerful than Doty ever
will be.

2879
03:06:48,824 --> 03:06:49,899
TRAVIS: He's also not alive.

2880
03:06:49,899 --> 03:06:51,444
LAURA: Yeah, do it. Do it!

2881
03:06:51,444 --> 03:06:52,414
LIAM: All right, then.

2882
03:06:52,414 --> 03:06:53,927
LAURA: I mean, do it if you want to. I'm standing
in the doorway.

2883
03:06:53,927 --> 03:07:00,369
MARISHA: Okay, all right, all right, if you wanna
read it, I will go over your shoulder and be on

2884
03:07:00,369 --> 03:07:02,619
the ready in case anything bad happens.

2885
03:07:02,619 --> 03:07:06,874
SAM: In a way, the cover of a book is kind of like
a door.

2886
03:07:06,874 --> 03:07:07,823
LAURA: A little bit.

2887
03:07:07,823 --> 03:07:08,918
MARISHA: It's true.

2888
03:07:08,918 --> 03:07:09,697
MATT: (laughs)

2889
03:07:09,697 --> 03:07:10,509
SAM: So we're facing another door.

2890
03:07:10,509 --> 03:07:11,078
ASHLEY: Okay.

2891
03:07:11,078 --> 03:07:11,801
MATT: All right, what?

2892
03:07:11,801 --> 03:07:12,333
ASHLEY: I'm going to--

2893
03:07:12,333 --> 03:07:13,562
LIAM: Trying to earn points with us, or what?

2894
03:07:13,562 --> 03:07:14,963
SAM: (laughs)

2895
03:07:14,963 --> 03:07:17,428
ASHLEY: -- take my quill.

2896
03:07:17,428 --> 03:07:18,319
LAURA: (gasps)

2897
03:07:18,319 --> 03:07:19,195
MATT: Okay.

2898
03:07:19,195 --> 03:07:23,563
ASHLEY: And I'm just gonna peek it open, just a
little bit.

2899
03:07:23,563 --> 03:07:25,024
MATT: Okay. You peek it open.

2900
03:07:25,024 --> 03:07:26,579
SAM: (slamming noise)

2901
03:07:26,579 --> 03:07:27,443
ASHLEY: Anything happens?

2902
03:07:27,443 --> 03:07:30,060
MATT: Nah, just the top creaks open.

2903
03:07:30,060 --> 03:07:32,156
SAM: Bikini islands.

2904
03:07:32,156 --> 03:07:33,203
TALIESIN: This'll be like the end of the second
act--

2905
03:07:33,203 --> 03:07:34,071
ASHLEY: Flip it open.

2906
03:07:34,071 --> 03:07:35,097
TALIESIN: -- the second act of Ghostbusters.

2907
03:07:35,097 --> 03:07:38,250
MATT: The top of the tome flips open. Couple pages
go like (fwoosh) kinda stuck to it, and then fall

2908
03:07:38,250 --> 03:07:39,534
back into place.

2909
03:07:39,534 --> 03:07:40,779
LIAM: Do a jump scare.

2910
03:07:40,779 --> 03:07:41,532
ASHLEY: (spooky groaning noise)

2911
03:07:41,532 --> 03:07:42,372
MARISHA: Fall back into place? Why? What?

2912
03:07:42,372 --> 03:07:43,292
LAURA: Well, it's just open, it's just an open
book.

2913
03:07:43,292 --> 03:07:45,723
MATT: The pages kinda like curl back in, almost
like they were stuck to the--

2914
03:07:45,723 --> 03:07:46,645
MARISHA: Okay. Nothing weird.

2915
03:07:46,645 --> 03:07:47,713
MATT: Nothing weird.

2916
03:07:47,713 --> 03:07:48,689
LAURA: Just air.

2917
03:07:48,689 --> 03:07:49,849
MARISHA: Just air, yeah, just a draft.

2918
03:07:49,849 --> 03:07:55,821
MATT: A little bit of dust kinda like (swoosh)
off the bottom of it. The pages are old. You see a

2919
03:07:55,821 --> 03:07:57,395
little bit of text drawn on it.

2920
03:07:57,395 --> 03:07:58,978
LAURA: What does it say? What is it? What does it
look like?

2921
03:07:58,978 --> 03:08:00,144
MATT: What languages do you know, Pike?

2922
03:08:00,144 --> 03:08:01,913
LIAM: Shush.

2923
03:08:03,629 --> 03:08:08,153
ASHLEY: Gnomish, Common, Underdark, Undercommon,
Dwarvish.

2924
03:08:08,153 --> 03:08:09,180
LIAM: Ooh.

2925
03:08:09,180 --> 03:08:10,742
MATT: You do not recognize the text.

2926
03:08:10,742 --> 03:08:11,526
ASHLEY: I can't read it.

2927
03:08:11,526 --> 03:08:12,314
LIAM: Is it Abyssal?

2928
03:08:12,314 --> 03:08:12,879
LAURA: Shit.

2929
03:08:12,879 --> 03:08:13,634
MATT: It is Abyssal.

2930
03:08:13,634 --> 03:08:14,802
LAURA: Aw, fuck.

2931
03:08:14,802 --> 03:08:16,800
MARISHA: You are the only ones who can speak
Abyssal.

2932
03:08:16,800 --> 03:08:18,162
SAM: (laughs) That reaction.

2933
03:08:18,162 --> 03:08:18,976
LAURA: Oh, no.

2934
03:08:18,976 --> 03:08:19,875
TRAVIS: Time to die.

2935
03:08:19,875 --> 03:08:21,375
LIAM: I'll do it.

2936
03:08:21,375 --> 03:08:23,689
LAURA: What? Lemme see-- how much-- how wise are
you?

2937
03:08:23,689 --> 03:08:24,439
MARISHA: Okay, all right--

2938
03:08:24,439 --> 03:08:25,583
TRAVIS: I approve of this decision-making.

2939
03:08:25,583 --> 03:08:26,286
MARISHA: -- hang on, hang on.

2940
03:08:26,286 --> 03:08:27,106
ASHLEY: Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.

2941
03:08:27,106 --> 03:08:28,204
LAURA: You're not even as wise as I am.

2942
03:08:28,204 --> 03:08:29,249
MARISHA: Who wants to read it? I can--

2943
03:08:29,249 --> 03:08:30,444
LIAM: That's very subjective!

2944
03:08:30,444 --> 03:08:31,591
LAURA: (laughs)

2945
03:08:31,591 --> 03:08:32,687
MARISHA: I'll enhance your ability.

2946
03:08:32,687 --> 03:08:33,586
TALIESIN: Do you act--

2947
03:08:33,586 --> 03:08:35,860
MATT: Enhance does not really help with saving
throws. Just so you know.

2948
03:08:35,860 --> 03:08:36,751
ASHLEY: I'll cast Bless--

2949
03:08:36,751 --> 03:08:37,625
LIAM: I already did that.

2950
03:08:37,625 --> 03:08:38,887
MATT: Just ability checks. If it's an ability
check, it'll help.

2951
03:08:38,887 --> 03:08:39,980
LIAM: I Blessed myself.

2952
03:08:39,980 --> 03:08:41,503
MATT: But just so you know.

2953
03:08:41,503 --> 03:08:42,740
MARISHA: Can I do anything--

2954
03:08:42,740 --> 03:08:43,984
MATT: That's up to you.

2955
03:08:43,984 --> 03:08:44,987
SAM: Turn into a dragon.

2956
03:08:44,987 --> 03:08:46,865
(all laugh)

2957
03:08:46,865 --> 03:08:47,796
LAURA: I'm gonna step up.

2958
03:08:47,796 --> 03:08:48,805
MARISHA: I just eat the book!

2959
03:08:48,805 --> 03:08:49,509
MATT: (laughs)

2960
03:08:49,509 --> 03:08:50,329
TALIESIN: (burps)

2961
03:08:50,329 --> 03:08:51,196
MARISHA: (laughs)

2962
03:08:51,196 --> 03:08:52,047
LAURA: I'm gonna go up and try to look at it.

2963
03:08:52,047 --> 03:08:52,687
MATT: Okay.

2964
03:08:52,687 --> 03:08:53,693
ASHLEY: I'm gonna cast Bless on her.

2965
03:08:53,693 --> 03:08:54,303
MARISHA: Who's reading?

2966
03:08:54,303 --> 03:08:54,757
MATT: Okay.

2967
03:08:54,757 --> 03:08:55,574
MARISHA: Are you reading?

2968
03:08:55,574 --> 03:08:56,208
LAURA: Yeah.

2969
03:08:56,208 --> 03:08:56,786
MATT: So.

2970
03:08:56,786 --> 03:08:59,902
MARISHA: I cast Enhance Ability on her and give
her, I think it's Owl's Wisdom.

2971
03:08:59,902 --> 03:09:00,940
MATT: Sure, all right.

2972
03:09:00,940 --> 03:09:01,832
LAURA/LIAM: Ooh!

2973
03:09:01,832 --> 03:09:06,692
TALIESIN: I run over, I give you a quick kiss. I
say, if you turn evil, it's still cool. Just so

2974
03:09:06,692 --> 03:09:07,864
you know.

2975
03:09:07,864 --> 03:09:08,824
(all laugh)

2976
03:09:08,824 --> 03:09:09,969
MATT: All right. So, Vex.

2977
03:09:09,969 --> 03:09:10,771
LAURA: Yeah?

2978
03:09:10,771 --> 03:09:16,970
MATT: You begin to glance through the pages and
the words form around you, and you get a ways into

2979
03:09:16,970 --> 03:09:24,087
it, and it's interesting. This is a personal
notebook. It's a tome, but this is written by

2980
03:09:24,087 --> 03:09:25,312
Opash, this is--

2981
03:09:25,312 --> 03:09:26,527
LAURA: This is a gir-nal.

2982
03:09:26,527 --> 03:09:28,490
MATT: Yeah. (laughs)

2983
03:09:28,490 --> 03:09:29,350
SAM: (blows raspberry)

2984
03:09:29,350 --> 03:09:30,223
TALIESIN: Whoa.

2985
03:09:30,223 --> 03:09:31,098
SAM: (laughs)

2986
03:09:31,098 --> 03:09:32,260
LIAM: Well done. Well done.

2987
03:09:32,260 --> 03:09:38,461
MATT: This goes into Opash's history on Marquet
during the Age of Arcanum, a lot of the terrible

2988
03:09:38,461 --> 03:09:43,347
experiments that he was currently working on that
dealt with rending and capturing the soul.

2989
03:09:43,347 --> 03:09:44,314
LAURA: (gasps)

2990
03:09:44,314 --> 03:09:50,146
MATT: Capturing the servants and people that
wandered the desert and would just-- had a series

2991
03:09:50,146 --> 03:09:52,431
of caverns across the continent that were--

2992
03:09:52,431 --> 03:09:53,189
MARISHA: (sneezes)

2993
03:09:53,189 --> 03:09:53,913
TALIESIN: Bless you.

2994
03:09:53,913 --> 03:09:57,364
MATT: -- his to use, where he kept these
individuals trapped in gems or glass

2995
03:09:57,364 --> 03:10:04,866
menagerie-type structures where he would come back
at his whim and just destroy souls, shatter them,

2996
03:10:04,866 --> 03:10:11,797
corrupt them, forge them into things, feed on
them. He was fascinated with the never-ending

2997
03:10:11,797 --> 03:10:17,756
essence of existence and how to manipulate it and
make it his own. It goes into that. It goes into

2998
03:10:17,756 --> 03:10:20,878
people that didn't understand him in Marquet; how
he was driven out, the trials that were put

2999
03:10:20,878 --> 03:10:26,621
against him, his banishment to the island. And
then in learning about the facet of this island

3000
03:10:26,621 --> 03:10:32,600
that there's something about the metal here,
something very ancient about this island that

3001
03:10:32,600 --> 03:10:38,428
becomes this black hole of arcane projection.
Astral Projection is not possible from the island,

3002
03:10:38,428 --> 03:10:45,868
he discovered as he attempted that. And travel
magics that go to or from the island have a very

3003
03:10:45,868 --> 03:10:51,048
difficult ability to escape it, if not get very
messed up in the process.

3004
03:10:51,048 --> 03:10:52,099
MARISHA: We learned that.

3005
03:10:52,099 --> 03:10:53,118
TALIESIN: Yep.

3006
03:10:53,118 --> 03:10:57,099
MATT: However, it talks about how, when he was
banished there, he discovered the indigenous

3007
03:10:57,099 --> 03:11:03,041
people and those that lived on nearby islands that
would take small ships from island to island, and

3008
03:11:03,041 --> 03:11:11,175
there was a trade route there. He convinced and
corrupted them to come and work for him, and such,

3009
03:11:11,175 --> 03:11:15,329
he brought the entire civilization from these
multiple islands to come live on this island under

3010
03:11:15,329 --> 03:11:20,559
him. And then he reaved them all to become his
experiments to continue here on this island. And

3011
03:11:20,559 --> 03:11:25,776
you get a sense, reading through, that the masses
of people you saw within that giant chasm that

3012
03:11:25,776 --> 03:11:29,095
were clawing at you as you passed, those were all
the people that used to live on these islands.

3013
03:11:29,095 --> 03:11:32,329
LAURA and ASHLEY: Oh my gosh!

3014
03:11:32,329 --> 03:11:42,646
MATT: You then also discover a few different
chapters. One that mentions finding a near-dead

3015
03:11:42,646 --> 03:11:50,858
dragon that washes on shore, a red dragon on the
cusp of death. And what a great gift it is, to

3016
03:11:50,858 --> 03:11:57,173
discover, to toy with the soul of an ancient
entity like this. And it speaks of years of

3017
03:11:57,173 --> 03:12:05,491
enslaving this red dragon and torturing and
extracting information and manipulating and making

3018
03:12:05,491 --> 03:12:13,145
it his own toy. And then, began to pull together
research he had read elsewhere on the continuation

3019
03:12:13,145 --> 03:12:19,175
of a dragon's soul, of being able to take the
spirit of a dragon and make it indestructible and

3020
03:12:19,175 --> 03:12:27,630
to live from body to body. And if he could find a
way to correct this to work for himself it

3021
03:12:27,630 --> 03:12:33,785
wouldn't be-- his power would continue without the
binds of lichdom that a lot of other type magics

3022
03:12:33,785 --> 03:12:41,012
would eventually be bound to-- the phylactery
element, through a dragon transition would be a

3023
03:12:41,012 --> 03:12:50,912
lot easier to maintain, and his hope for doing so.
It beings to speak of a ritual, one that involved

3024
03:12:50,912 --> 03:12:58,333
this ancient, ancient entity dragon called Guuthal
the Ever-Fed. A mighty black dragon that was

3025
03:12:58,333 --> 03:13:02,552
instilled with necromantic power that terrorized
the world during the Age of Arcanum in its first

3026
03:13:02,552 --> 03:13:09,600
millennia. Guuthal had used ritualistic aid,
forbidden rites, and sacrifice of its own

3027
03:13:09,600 --> 03:13:22,889
lifeforce to be born again as this never-dying new
form of unlife referred to as a dracolich.

3028
03:13:22,889 --> 03:13:32,931
However, the last few notes in Opash's hand end
abruptly and

3029
03:13:32,931 --> 03:13:36,495
a new handwriting in Draconic begins.

3030
03:13:36,495 --> 03:13:37,594
LAURA: Which I also read.

3031
03:13:37,594 --> 03:13:45,713
MATT: Which you also read. These notes are less
poetic and speaking to itself in the way Opash was

3032
03:13:45,766 --> 03:13:51,773
by himself and needed somebody to converse with,
and he chose his words. This is a much more

3033
03:13:51,773 --> 03:14:02,216
direct, trying to piece together parts of an
equation. And you start seeing references to J'mon

3034
03:14:02,216 --> 03:14:11,669
Sa Ord, you see references to being the king that
rises from the ashes. You begin to realize that

3035
03:14:11,669 --> 03:14:17,245
these are the words of Thordak. This was the
moment when Thordak overtook Opash, destroyed him,

3036
03:14:17,245 --> 03:14:26,625
and made the lair his own. This history then goes
into Thordak's interest in trying to find power to

3037
03:14:26,625 --> 03:14:34,656
take this ritual unto himself and thus become an
undying entity. The notes finish with the intent

3038
03:14:34,656 --> 03:14:42,152
of Thordak going north to seek out mages, to seek
out power, things he could bind to his will and

3039
03:14:42,152 --> 03:14:49,758
bring them back to make this ritual happen. That's
the last passage you see. You begin to realize

3040
03:14:49,758 --> 03:14:57,488
that the knowledge that Thordak had, and was
holding from Raishan, was the knowledge of this

3041
03:14:57,488 --> 03:15:05,391
ritual that would probably be what would enable
her to bypass the curse that she had.

3042
03:15:05,391 --> 03:15:07,297
LAURA: Oh my gosh. But we killed her.

3043
03:15:07,297 --> 03:15:09,037
MATT: But you killed her.

3044
03:15:09,037 --> 03:15:11,290
LAURA: This could have been so much worse.

3045
03:15:11,290 --> 03:15:13,151
MARISHA: Yes, it could've.

3046
03:15:13,151 --> 03:15:15,838
MATT: I also need you to make a wisdom saving
throw.

3047
03:15:15,838 --> 03:15:18,009
SAM: Ooh, shnikies!

3048
03:15:18,009 --> 03:15:18,855
ASHLEY: Can I--

3049
03:15:18,855 --> 03:15:20,063
LIAM: Bless, bless, bless.

3050
03:15:20,063 --> 03:15:20,781
TRAVIS: Can I--

3051
03:15:20,781 --> 03:15:21,891
LAURA: What does Bless do?

3052
03:15:21,891 --> 03:15:24,609
ASHLEY: Can I also cast Beacon of Hope on her?

3053
03:15:24,609 --> 03:15:25,777
SAM: It's like inspiration.

3054
03:15:25,777 --> 03:15:26,964
LAURA: Don't fuck me, Gil!

3055
03:15:26,964 --> 03:15:28,114
MATT: What's Beacon of Hope do?

3056
03:15:28,114 --> 03:15:30,364
ASHLEY: Beacon of Hope gives you advantage on
wisdom saving throws.

3057
03:15:30,364 --> 03:15:31,595
MATT: Okay.

3058
03:15:31,595 --> 03:15:32,968
LAURA: Oh, tight.

3059
03:15:32,968 --> 03:15:34,442
MATT: So, Beacon of Hope is cast.

3060
03:15:34,442 --> 03:15:35,762
LIAM: It's already good.

3061
03:15:35,762 --> 03:15:38,764
LAURA: Okay, 16.

3062
03:15:38,764 --> 03:15:40,105
LIAM: Roll a d4 and add it.

3063
03:15:40,105 --> 03:15:42,939
LAURA: It's just saving throw?

3064
03:15:42,939 --> 03:15:45,279
MATT: Saving throw, yes.

3065
03:15:45,279 --> 03:15:49,877
LAURA: 18 + 3 is 21, plus two.

3066
03:15:49,877 --> 03:15:50,902
LIAM: What does that Owl's Wisdom do?

3067
03:15:50,902 --> 03:15:51,812
LAURA: 23.

3068
03:15:51,812 --> 03:15:52,610
MARISHA: Huh?

3069
03:15:52,610 --> 03:15:53,514
LIAM: What does Owl's Wisdom do?

3070
03:15:53,514 --> 03:15:56,493
MARISHA: It gives you advantage on wisdom checks.

3071
03:15:56,493 --> 03:15:57,266
LAURA: Oh, okay.

3072
03:15:57,266 --> 03:15:58,239
MARISHA: Not saving throws.

3073
03:15:58,239 --> 03:16:03,458
MATT: Not saving throws. So, as you're reading
through this, you guys watch as Vex's attention--

3074
03:16:03,458 --> 03:16:09,082
LAURA: Oh wait, (whispers) 18, 19, 20, 23 (louder)
25.

3075
03:16:09,082 --> 03:16:11,157
MATT: 25, okay.

3076
03:16:11,157 --> 03:16:14,602
LAURA: Oh no, that's a 16, I'm sorry! I was right,
it was 23. I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

3077
03:16:14,602 --> 03:16:16,212
I'm sorry, I'm a dick!

3078
03:16:16,212 --> 03:16:20,509
MATT: As you are reading through this, and you go
through, you watch as she turns the pages faster

3079
03:16:20,509 --> 03:16:28,253
and faster and her eyes unblinkingly are just
scanning the pages with rapid pace. And, Vex, you

3080
03:16:28,253 --> 03:16:34,648
feel this cold essence begin to curl through your
shoulders and into the back of the neck and right

3081
03:16:34,648 --> 03:16:40,033
as you finish the last bit of notes before
Thordak, you feel something try to reach for the

3082
03:16:40,033 --> 03:16:45,880
back of your mind. Cold fingers, ten, 20, an
endless supply of grasping fingers reach for the

3083
03:16:45,880 --> 03:16:51,620
back of your mind. And you shrug it off and pull
yourself away from the book and the cold fades.

3084
03:16:51,620 --> 03:16:54,406
LAURA: I shut the book.

3085
03:16:55,589 --> 03:16:57,926
MARISHA: You all right?

3086
03:16:57,926 --> 03:16:59,817
LAURA: Great.

3087
03:16:59,817 --> 03:17:01,552
TRAVIS: Bad story?

3088
03:17:01,552 --> 03:17:03,449
LAURA: I tell them everything I read.

3089
03:17:03,449 --> 03:17:04,820
MATT: Yeah.

3090
03:17:04,820 --> 03:17:07,358
LAURA: Super fast 'cause I'm, like, a speed reader
it's no big deal.

3091
03:17:07,358 --> 03:17:10,159
LIAM: You were reading for like 25 minutes.

3092
03:17:10,159 --> 03:17:11,721
LAURA: Oh shit! Well, it was a big journal.

3093
03:17:11,721 --> 03:17:12,722
LIAM: Yeah.

3094
03:17:12,722 --> 03:17:18,990
SAM: It's amazing. Anastasia Steele fell in love
with Christian Grey just like that? Amazing!

3095
03:17:18,990 --> 03:17:20,594
(all laugh)

3096
03:17:20,594 --> 03:17:21,742
TRAVIS: Jesus Christ.

3097
03:17:21,742 --> 03:17:22,705
TALIESIN: It's a knockout.

3098
03:17:22,705 --> 03:17:23,498
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

3099
03:17:23,498 --> 03:17:25,048
TALIESIN: Wow, now I can feel the fingers in the
back of my head.

3100
03:17:25,048 --> 03:17:27,145
(all laugh)

3101
03:17:27,145 --> 03:17:28,859
MATT: All the rest of us making a wisdom saving
throw!

3102
03:17:28,859 --> 03:17:30,075
TALIESIN: Damn it.

3103
03:17:30,075 --> 03:17:34,542
SAM: I know Laura read that.

3104
03:17:34,542 --> 03:17:40,780
LAURA: I read most of it and then I just threw the
book away.

3105
03:17:40,780 --> 03:17:45,017
TALIESIN: Pike, can we destroy this thing?

3106
03:17:45,017 --> 03:17:45,828
ASHLEY: That was--

3107
03:17:45,828 --> 03:17:46,666
LAURA: Well--

3108
03:17:46,666 --> 03:17:48,344
ASHELY: -- what I was going to see if we--

3109
03:17:48,344 --> 03:17:51,776
LAURA: Should we destroy this thing? I feel like
maybe, I mean--

3110
03:17:51,776 --> 03:17:53,591
TALIESIN: The knowledge exists now.

3111
03:17:53,591 --> 03:17:54,492
LAURA: It's true.

3112
03:17:54,492 --> 03:17:58,374
TALIESIN: It's outside the book, and if the book
was-- there's something in there.

3113
03:17:58,374 --> 03:18:01,489
MARISHA: Can we have Doty copy down everything
that you just said?

3114
03:18:01,489 --> 03:18:03,222
TALIESIN: Oh! Oh!

3115
03:18:03,222 --> 03:18:04,595
LIAM: She said.

3116
03:18:04,595 --> 03:18:08,275
MARISHA: Not actually exact transcriptions, just
so we keep the knowledge.

3117
03:18:08,275 --> 03:18:11,096
TALIESIN: Transcription of the story.

3118
03:18:11,096 --> 03:18:17,499
SAM: I mean, sure, he can record what her report
is if you like, sure, yes.

3119
03:18:17,499 --> 03:18:18,428
TALIESIN: It would be invaluable.

3120
03:18:18,428 --> 03:18:19,546
LAURA: All right.

3121
03:18:19,546 --> 03:18:23,535
MATT: Doty walks over to one of the nearby shelves
and finds one of the books that is only partially

3122
03:18:23,535 --> 03:18:25,071
written in, tears out all the pages--

3123
03:18:25,071 --> 03:18:25,964
LAURA: Okay, no, okay.

3124
03:18:25,964 --> 03:18:26,766
TALIESIN: That was--

3125
03:18:26,766 --> 03:18:27,750
LAURA: That's something.

3126
03:18:27,750 --> 03:18:30,371
MATT: -- and just begins transcribing from memory
what you just said.

3127
03:18:30,371 --> 03:18:31,523
MARISHA: High school notes?

3128
03:18:31,523 --> 03:18:36,603
TALIESIN: No, that was a sea captain's journal.
It's okay, it doesn't matter, it's not--

3129
03:18:36,603 --> 03:18:39,229
SAM: He didn't burn them, we could just--

3130
03:18:39,297 --> 03:18:40,972
TRAVIS: Are we doing that now? I mean, I can help
him, just--

3131
03:18:40,972 --> 03:18:41,744
LAURA: No, Grog!

3132
03:18:41,744 --> 03:18:42,725
TALIESIN: No no no no no!

3133
03:18:42,725 --> 03:18:43,664
GROG: And I just rip--

3134
03:18:43,664 --> 03:18:48,855
LAURA: Should we destroy-destroy this?

3135
03:18:48,855 --> 03:18:51,963
TALIESIN: I think so.

3136
03:18:51,963 --> 03:18:53,955
SAM: It's magical of some sort?

3137
03:18:53,955 --> 03:18:59,310
LAURA: It certainly felt like something was trying
to reach through.

3138
03:18:59,310 --> 03:19:01,759
MARISHA: That doesn't sit well with me.

3139
03:19:01,759 --> 03:19:10,767
LAURA: And what good does it do the world to know
how to bring back souls as the undead? It seems

3140
03:19:10,767 --> 03:19:11,811
kind of dark.

3141
03:19:11,811 --> 03:19:15,154
SAM: Do you lot have some sort of a vault here or
something?

3142
03:19:15,154 --> 03:19:16,895
TRAVIS: Do we?

3143
03:19:16,895 --> 03:19:18,364
MATT: You didn't have one made.

3144
03:19:18,364 --> 03:19:19,760
MARISHA: We don't here; we do in Whitestone.

3145
03:19:19,760 --> 03:19:24,614
TALIESIN: Even if there is a vault, all the vault
is is a-- it's the one place in any city where

3146
03:19:24,614 --> 03:19:28,754
everyone knows something valuable's kept.

3147
03:19:28,754 --> 03:19:32,537
SAM: A magical vault somewhere you could send this
thing to be far away?

3148
03:19:32,615 --> 03:19:34,047
LAURA: Well, we have a bag of holding.

3149
03:19:34,047 --> 03:19:37,045
TRAVIS: Ooh! You know what? We could like send it
into the plane where Craven Edge is and we'll take

3150
03:19:37,045 --> 03:19:39,014
the sword out and put the book in in its place.

3151
03:19:39,014 --> 03:19:41,317
TALIESIN: You know, I feel like there's someone
collecting terrible things.

3152
03:19:41,525 --> 03:19:42,524
LAURA: All terrible things.

3153
03:19:42,524 --> 03:19:45,197
LIAM: We could throw it in the black spinny thing
under Whitestone, or--

3154
03:19:45,197 --> 03:19:46,257
LAURA: Oh no!

3155
03:19:46,257 --> 03:19:48,598
LIAM: -- we could just give it to Allura.

3156
03:19:48,598 --> 03:19:53,034
MARISHA: We were also going to go the Cobalt
Reserve anyway, we could see, I'm sure they have

3157
03:19:53,034 --> 03:19:58,230
some sort of a library special secret book vault.

3158
03:19:58,230 --> 03:19:59,852
TALIESIN: I would feel all right with that.

3159
03:19:59,852 --> 03:20:01,991
LAURA: Let's keep it in the bag of holding for the
time being.

3160
03:20:02,040 --> 03:20:02,732
TRAVIS: Okay.

3161
03:20:02,732 --> 03:20:03,698
TALIESIN: Let's re-lock it.

3162
03:20:03,698 --> 03:20:04,395
LIAM: Big responsibility.

3163
03:20:04,395 --> 03:20:05,061
LAURA: Definitely.

3164
03:20:05,061 --> 03:20:05,709
MARISHA: Re-lock it.

3165
03:20:05,709 --> 03:20:06,480
LAURA: Re-lock it. Re-lock it.

3166
03:20:06,480 --> 03:20:07,865
MARISHA: I vote we take it to the Cobalt Reserve.

3167
03:20:07,865 --> 03:20:08,876
TALIESIN: I concur.

3168
03:20:08,876 --> 03:20:10,090
MATT: Okay.

3169
03:20:10,090 --> 03:20:10,956
LIAM: Do you concur? I concur.

3170
03:20:10,956 --> 03:20:11,764
LAURA: I concur.

3171
03:20:11,764 --> 03:20:12,561
TALIESIN: You concur?

3172
03:20:12,561 --> 03:20:16,816
MARISHA: Either that, or Vasselheim. One of the
two will have options, I'm sure.

3173
03:20:16,816 --> 03:20:19,714
TALIESIN: I feel that the Cobalt Reserve will
probably have some sort of

3174
03:20:19,714 --> 03:20:21,705
situation for books like this.

3175
03:20:21,705 --> 03:20:22,498
MARISHA: Okay.

3176
03:20:22,498 --> 03:20:24,159
TALIESIN: That seems reasonable.

3177
03:20:24,159 --> 03:20:26,067
MATT: So, what's the next step?

3178
03:20:26,067 --> 03:20:28,660
LAURA: We're going to go to Westruun. Right?

3179
03:20:28,660 --> 03:20:32,770
MARISHA: Did we go through all of the papers that
Raishan and everything had, for the most part?

3180
03:20:32,770 --> 03:20:37,792
MATT: All those notes seemed to pertain to that
book, and once you had the information from Vex,

3181
03:20:37,792 --> 03:20:42,606
it kind of connected all the dots. A lot of these
were notes regarding this ritual. Trying to find

3182
03:20:42,606 --> 03:20:50,881
ways to break the chain of the life/death cycle
and obsession with the alteration and harvesting

3183
03:20:50,881 --> 03:20:56,329
of souls and spiritual energy for the use of
powering arcane experimentation.

3184
03:20:56,329 --> 03:20:58,464
So, not good stuff.

3185
03:20:58,464 --> 03:21:04,655
MARISHA: He mentioned going north and looking for
other powerful entities and objects to bind with.

3186
03:21:04,655 --> 03:21:10,986
And then Raishan thought it would be a good idea
to settle down in Whitestone.

3187
03:21:12,276 --> 03:21:13,742
TRAVIS: Before we killed Raishan, didn't she say--

3188
03:21:13,742 --> 03:21:17,440
LAURA: Well, Wildmount is far north. Raishan said
she was from Wildmount.

3189
03:21:17,440 --> 03:21:20,183
TRAVIS: Right. And she said she had found what she
needed.

3190
03:21:20,183 --> 03:21:23,229
MATT: No, Raishan actually was from--

3191
03:21:23,229 --> 03:21:24,179
TALIESIN: South.

3192
03:21:24,179 --> 03:21:25,576
MATT: -- she was south of Tal'Dorei.

3193
03:21:25,576 --> 03:21:26,178
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3194
03:21:26,178 --> 03:21:26,827
LAURA: She was?

3195
03:21:26,827 --> 03:21:27,388
MATT: Yeah.

3196
03:21:27,388 --> 03:21:28,015
TALIESIN: Yes.

3197
03:21:28,015 --> 03:21:34,194
MARISHA: She had an interest in Whitestone, which
makes me wonder what the spinning black orb of

3198
03:21:34,194 --> 03:21:38,446
death has to do with all of this. Because I'm
still not convinced that it doesn't have some sort

3199
03:21:38,446 --> 03:21:40,335
of play in everything.

3200
03:21:40,335 --> 03:21:43,172
TALIESIN: It's just a spinning black orb of death
sitting underneath my family home.

3201
03:21:43,172 --> 03:21:44,234
LAURA: Dedicated to Vecna.

3202
03:21:44,234 --> 03:21:48,621
TALIESIN: No. There's nothing-- I'm well aware
that it's terrible. I don't know why you're

3203
03:21:48,621 --> 03:21:51,417
staring at me like that. Yes, I think about it a
lot. I'm--

3204
03:21:51,417 --> 03:21:53,458
MARISHA: I'm just, you know--

3205
03:21:53,458 --> 03:21:56,563
TALIESIN: I just don't know what to do about it.

3206
03:21:56,563 --> 03:22:02,502
LIAM: Well, we can, well, not me, but smart people
can devote more attention now that there's not

3207
03:22:02,502 --> 03:22:05,005
five great dragons trying to tear the world
apart.

3208
03:22:05,005 --> 03:22:06,131
TALIESIN: We'll help.

3209
03:22:06,131 --> 03:22:07,525
MARISHA: What time is it?

3210
03:22:07,525 --> 03:22:11,030
MATT: At this time, with you guys travelling
through the city, getting here, with the research,

3211
03:22:11,030 --> 03:22:17,755
I'd say it's getting pretty close to dusk. You
probably have like an hour or so

3212
03:22:17,755 --> 03:22:20,369
before the sun sets.

3213
03:22:21,976 --> 03:22:24,983
MARISHA: You all want to rest? Take the night off,
head to Westruun in the morning?

3214
03:22:24,983 --> 03:22:25,930
LAURA: Sure.

3215
03:22:25,930 --> 03:22:27,524
LIAM: Yeah. Back to the keep.

3216
03:22:27,524 --> 03:22:29,433
TALIESIN: Back to the keep. We are in the keep.

3217
03:22:29,433 --> 03:22:30,254
MARISHA: We are in the keep.

3218
03:22:30,254 --> 03:22:31,156
MATT: You are in the keep.

3219
03:22:31,156 --> 03:22:32,918
LIAM: We stay in the keep.

3220
03:22:32,918 --> 03:22:39,191
SAM: Has Emon come back enough to have shops open
for business or anything?

3221
03:22:39,191 --> 03:22:43,249
MATT: Yeah, I mean, not everything was destroyed.
There are shops that are open and there are people

3222
03:22:43,249 --> 03:22:47,059
running business here. I mean, a number of the
districts got damaged and some buildings are

3223
03:22:47,059 --> 03:22:55,542
having to be rebuilt, but it is still a functional
city. Though to a lesser degree right now.

3224
03:22:55,873 --> 03:22:56,954
MARISHA: You know, before we--

3225
03:22:56,954 --> 03:22:58,593
TALIESIN: Did you want to shop now or later?

3226
03:22:58,593 --> 03:23:03,236
SAM: I don't want to waste time. Everything I do,
I have to buy.

3227
03:23:03,236 --> 03:23:04,640
LAURA: Oh.

3228
03:23:04,640 --> 03:23:07,561
TALIESIN: Well, we can shop in the morning, on the
way out.

3229
03:23:07,561 --> 03:23:08,296
LAURA: Yeah.

3230
03:23:08,296 --> 03:23:09,849
SAM: Sure. Yep.

3231
03:23:09,849 --> 03:23:10,877
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's fair.

3232
03:23:10,877 --> 03:23:13,582
LAURA: Not in a huge rush. Yeah.

3233
03:23:13,582 --> 03:23:15,536
SAM: I'm at your disposal.

3234
03:23:15,536 --> 03:23:19,686
LAURA: We'll shop in Emon in the morning and then
head out to Westruun. They'll have shops there,

3235
03:23:19,686 --> 03:23:21,240
too. Just not as many.

3236
03:23:21,240 --> 03:23:22,389
TALIESIN: Brunch.

3237
03:23:22,389 --> 03:23:23,384
MARISHA: Brunch.

3238
03:23:23,384 --> 03:23:24,423
SAM: At dawn, we brunch.

3239
03:23:24,423 --> 03:23:25,429
TALIESIN: At dawn, we brunch.

3240
03:23:25,429 --> 03:23:27,163
LIAM: Please. Please.

3241
03:23:27,163 --> 03:23:29,471
TALIESIN: No chicken.

3242
03:23:29,471 --> 03:23:35,037
MATT: As the sun sets across the Tal'Dorei sky,
you all settle in for the evening to rest,

3243
03:23:35,037 --> 03:23:40,714
contemplate the return of your ally. Your next
venture in researching the path before you as Vox

3244
03:23:40,714 --> 03:23:48,100
Machina. You to return soon to finish your
Aramente to your people and see what lies ahead of

3245
03:23:48,100 --> 03:23:54,291
you by the threads of fate wielded by the Raven
Queen. At dawn, you brunch. And until then we'll

3246
03:23:54,291 --> 03:23:56,692
return next week, with the next episode of
Critical Role.

3247
03:23:56,692 --> 03:24:00,541
(all cheer)

3248
03:24:00,541 --> 03:24:03,490
LAURA: (sings) Everybody's still alive for the
time being.

3249
03:24:03,490 --> 03:24:04,581
LIAM: I really want brunch right now.

3250
03:24:04,581 --> 03:24:05,769
TALIESIN: I just want brunch so badly.

3251
03:24:05,769 --> 03:24:07,302
MATT: I know.

3252
03:24:07,302 --> 03:24:08,578
TALIESIN: I miss brunch.

3253
03:24:08,578 --> 03:24:12,038
LAURA: Those donuts were pretty fucking great.

3254
03:24:12,038 --> 03:24:16,243
MATT: Well, guys, thank you for watching.
Congratulations to our winner earlier. Thank you

3255
03:24:16,243 --> 03:24:17,579
again, Loot Crate, for being our awesome sponsor.

3256
03:24:17,579 --> 03:24:19,539
ALL: Loot Crate!

3257
03:24:19,539 --> 03:24:20,491
MATT: What's that?

3258
03:24:20,491 --> 03:24:21,591
CREW: We did make it for Amandine.

3259
03:24:21,591 --> 03:24:22,436
MATT: We made it for Amandine!

3260
03:24:22,436 --> 03:24:25,178
(cheers)

3261
03:24:25,178 --> 03:24:34,422
MATT: You guys are amazing. So we're going to go
ahead and get her all the best legal work that we

3262
03:24:34,422 --> 03:24:39,059
can to try and keep her in our midst. So thank you
guys so much for being generous and helping out

3263
03:24:39,059 --> 03:24:44,764
with that tremendously. Tremendously. It means a
lot. Both to her and all of us here at Geek &amp;

3264
03:24:44,764 --> 03:24:53,426
Sundry so thank you. Thank you. Some of us-- I'll
be returning tomorrow at noon for Eric's TBD RPG.

3265
03:24:53,426 --> 03:24:55,869
Doctor Who. Which will be fun.

3266
03:24:55,869 --> 03:24:56,666
TALIESIN: Doctor Whom.

3267
03:24:56,666 --> 03:25:00,088
MATT: With Darin De Paul. Doctor Whom. I'm sorry.
You're right. And then all of us will be here on

3268
03:25:00,088 --> 03:25:02,275
Saturday for the 24-hour two-year anniversary
stream!

3269
03:25:02,275 --> 03:25:03,295
LAURA: I don't know if all of us--

3270
03:25:03,295 --> 03:25:04,241
TALIESIN: Many of us--

3271
03:25:04,241 --> 03:25:06,243
MATT: Many of us, many of us will be here on
Saturday.

3272
03:25:06,243 --> 03:25:09,889
MARISHA: Definitely Matt, Taliesin, and I, and
maybe others?

3273
03:25:09,889 --> 03:25:12,925
TALIESIN: Hey, you don't have to DM the Mansions
for once!

3274
03:25:12,925 --> 03:25:14,510
MATT: That's true, 'cause the new edition.

3275
03:25:14,510 --> 03:25:15,745
TALIESIN: Now Apple will do it for you.

3276
03:25:15,745 --> 03:25:21,282
MATT: It's wonderful. I was the Keeper almost
every time for years. Big surprise, right?

3277
03:25:21,282 --> 03:25:25,184
MARISHA: Yeah, I've been the Keeper a couple of
times.

3278
03:25:25,184 --> 03:25:27,291
MATT: You did! Which is why I said "most".

3279
03:25:27,291 --> 03:25:28,333
MARISHA: A few, though.

3280
03:25:28,333 --> 03:25:29,500
MATT: You were great. It was fun.

3281
03:25:29,500 --> 03:25:31,961
TALIESIN: If we bring the expansion, you can still
be Ashcan Pete, too.

3282
03:25:31,961 --> 03:25:33,883
MARISHA: (rough voice) Oh, hell, yeah. Who can?
Ashcan.

3283
03:25:33,883 --> 03:25:34,797
TALIESIN: Ashcan Pete!

3284
03:25:34,797 --> 03:25:35,882
MATT: Ashcan Pete. He's the best.

3285
03:25:35,882 --> 03:25:37,134
TALIESIN: Your Ashcan Pete makes me happy.

3286
03:25:37,134 --> 03:25:39,068
MATT: Anyway, guys, awesome work. Ashley, we love
having you.

3287
03:25:39,068 --> 03:25:40,539
TRAVIS: Yeah, Ashley!

3288
03:25:40,539 --> 03:25:42,930
MATT: Don't go back.

3289
03:25:42,930 --> 03:25:44,048
ASHLEY: I know! I don't want to!

3290
03:25:44,048 --> 03:25:45,185
TRAVIS: Stay!

3291
03:25:45,185 --> 03:25:46,262
ASHLEY: I'm so close.

3292
03:25:46,262 --> 03:25:47,303
MATT: Yeah, we get you back soon.

3293
03:25:47,303 --> 03:25:51,136
ASHLEY: I have about three and a half to four
weeks. And then I'll be home for a long time.

3294
03:25:51,136 --> 03:25:52,748
LAURA: Yay!

3295
03:25:52,748 --> 03:25:56,258
MARISHA: Can you do the Skype-y things with us
next week? Do you know?

3296
03:25:56,258 --> 03:25:57,344
SAM: Don't pressure her.

3297
03:25:57,344 --> 03:25:58,439
TALIESIN: No, no pressure!

3298
03:25:58,439 --> 03:26:00,788
MARISHA: I'm allowed. Because I care.

3299
03:26:00,788 --> 03:26:05,554
ASHLEY: I don't know. I always hope so, but
sometimes that's proven to be a little bit more

3300
03:26:05,554 --> 03:26:08,358
difficult for some reason this season.

3301
03:26:08,358 --> 03:26:11,009
LAURA: It's because they made your part so big
this season.

3302
03:26:11,009 --> 03:26:11,718
MARISHA: I know!

3303
03:26:11,718 --> 03:26:12,786
ASHLEY: Well, doh doh doh.

3304
03:26:12,786 --> 03:26:14,124
LAURA: You're so talented and amazing.

3305
03:26:14,124 --> 03:26:15,274
TRAVIS: You're the best!

3306
03:26:15,274 --> 03:26:16,615
LIAM: Stupid innate ability.

3307
03:26:16,615 --> 03:26:21,439
ASHLEY: It's just-- No! It's just time change and
things.

3308
03:26:21,439 --> 03:26:23,879
(all laugh)

3309
03:26:23,879 --> 03:26:24,643
MATT: I know.

3310
03:26:24,643 --> 03:26:25,640
ASHLEY: I love being here, though.

3311
03:26:25,640 --> 03:26:26,527
MATT: I know. We miss you.

3312
03:26:26,527 --> 03:26:27,424
ASHLEY: Soon! So soon!

3313
03:26:27,424 --> 03:26:30,333
MATT: Soon. You'll be back soon. All right,
guys--

3314
03:26:30,333 --> 03:26:33,386
LIAM: Do we have an EMT and a stomach pump on hand
for Sam? For after the show?

3315
03:26:33,386 --> 03:26:34,509
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

3316
03:26:34,509 --> 03:26:35,565
ASHLEY: How's your tummy?

3317
03:26:35,565 --> 03:26:40,241
SAM: I ate a lot of sugar and caffeine at the
beginning of this show. I feel very strange.

3318
03:26:40,241 --> 03:26:41,882
TALIESIN: There's Big League Chew on the floor.

3319
03:26:41,882 --> 03:26:43,407
SAM: There is Big League Chew on the floor.

3320
03:26:43,407 --> 03:26:44,525
TALIESIN: There's a little bit of Big League
Chew.

3321
03:26:44,525 --> 03:26:46,105
LAURA: Ugh, gross!

3322
03:26:46,105 --> 03:26:46,996
MATT: That is disgusting.

3323
03:26:46,996 --> 03:26:48,106
SAM: And probably in my lower intestine.

3324
03:26:48,106 --> 03:26:49,205
TALIESIN: Wait, wait. Wait.

3325
03:26:49,205 --> 03:26:50,853
LAURA: Do not touch that, Taliesin.

3326
03:26:50,853 --> 03:26:52,161
MARISHA: No, no, Taliesin! Oh!

3327
03:26:52,161 --> 03:26:53,679
MATT: (laughs)

3328
03:26:53,679 --> 03:26:58,752
MARISHA: I'm never eating Big League Chew again.

3329
03:26:58,752 --> 03:27:01,202
TALIESIN: Good, then something positive has come
out of this.

3330
03:27:01,202 --> 03:27:02,322
SAM: It was purple flavor.

3331
03:27:02,322 --> 03:27:03,198
LAURA: Ew.

3332
03:27:03,198 --> 03:27:04,277
MATT: Purple flavor?

3333
03:27:04,277 --> 03:27:05,990
TALIESIN: That's not supposed to be purple.

3334
03:27:05,990 --> 03:27:10,459
MATT: Guys, thank you so much. We'll see you next
week. Love to you all and is it Thursday yet?

3335
03:27:10,459 --> 03:27:11,531
Good night, guys.

3336
03:27:11,531 --> 03:35:50,948
