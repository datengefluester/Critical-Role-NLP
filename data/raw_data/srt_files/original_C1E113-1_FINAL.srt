00:00:00,286 --> 00:00:05,515
MATT: Welcome, everyone, to today's special
edition of Critical Role, where a number of us are

2
00:00:05,515 --> 00:00:10,626
going to be playing a fantastic game in the realm
of Mordor, thanks to our fantastic sponsor for

3
00:00:10,626 --> 00:00:17,831
this event, WB Games! We're putting this together
in celebration of the release of their upcoming

4
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:23,723
game, Shadow of War, for Xbox and Playstation,
which all of us have worked on, actually, for an

5
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:28,705
extended period of time. Let's see. Well, first
off, Travis, who'd you play in the game?

6
00:00:28,705 --> 00:00:34,841
TRAVIS: I played Commanding Orc #1, 
and I scream like this and I will be

7
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:40,810
chasing you as you try and make your way through
the lands, and I escalate my ambitions through the

8
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,452
war ranks! I just made that up.

9
00:00:43,452 --> 00:00:47,625
MATT: So kill him immediately. Laura, who'd you
play in the game?

10
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,061
LAURA: I don't play an orc.

11
00:00:49,061 --> 00:00:50,853
MATT: No. Who do you play?

12
00:00:50,853 --> 00:00:54,793
LAURA: I play Eltariel, also known as the Blade of
Galadriel.

13
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:56,123
TRAVIS: She's super bad.

14
00:00:56,123 --> 00:01:01,125
LAURA: I'm a super cool and I have, like, daggers,
and I can kick a lot of butt.

15
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,044
MATT: That's a great little view of the character,
there.

16
00:01:03,044 --> 00:01:04,133
LAURA: Thanks.

17
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:05,475
TRAVIS: Just like a normal elf.

18
00:01:05,475 --> 00:01:07,724
LAURA: That's exactly how I recorded it.

19
00:01:07,724 --> 00:01:10,182
MATT: Perfect. Sam, what'd you do?

20
00:01:10,182 --> 00:01:22,523
SAM: I played a character named Orc 4, who, among
other things, hates humans. Enjoys grog. And is dumb.

21
00:01:22,523 --> 00:01:24,303
LAURA: How does he feel about elves?

22
00:01:24,303 --> 00:01:27,864
SAM: Oh, I think he hates them? I think he hates
most things.

23
00:01:27,864 --> 00:01:30,234
TRAVIS: Not a very affable--

24
00:01:30,234 --> 00:01:38,355
SAM: No, he just hates. He's a hater. Really, they
should spend more of the game talking about his

25
00:01:38,355 --> 00:01:42,656
wants and needs, and his ambitions and likes in
life, but no.

26
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,566
TRAVIS: Does he hate the player, or does he hate
the game?

27
00:01:44,566 --> 00:01:48,937
SAM: He hates both. Just hates a lot of stuff.

28
00:01:48,937 --> 00:01:53,583
MATT: That's perfect. Well, thank you, Sam. Mr.
Darin De Paul?

29
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,124
DARIN: Hi, internet friends!

30
00:01:55,124 --> 00:01:58,215
MATT: Hi! What'd you play in the game?

31
00:01:58,215 --> 00:02:05,790
DARIN: I am a massive olog, but he became-- one of
them became kind of notorious. Az-Laar the

32
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:12,299
Demolisher. There were, like, "RIP Az-Laar." There
were tribute videos to Az-Laar. People played sad

33
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:18,891
music when Az-Laar died. It was amazing. (deep
gruff voice) A big dumb thing, but he died from

34
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:23,210
flames! (normal voice) And people were very upset,
so they were playing tinkling music and going,

35
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,919
"Rest in Peace, Az-Laar! We hardly knew you."

36
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,169
LAURA: That was in the previous--?

37
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:33,727
DARIN: No, in this one. I was not in the previous.
I wasn't here yet. I had not come to California

38
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:38,188
yet. I was still in New York going, 
I really hope I get to do stuff like that!

39
00:02:38,188 --> 00:02:39,806
It's really fun!

40
00:02:39,806 --> 00:02:42,034
TRAVIS: You hear Darin and you're like, he was
definitely an orc forever.

41
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:43,175
LAURA: Yeah.

42
00:02:43,175 --> 00:02:47,260
DARIN: It's only been, it's a little over four
years that I have been among the people that I

43
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,628
admire most. It makes my heart so happy.

44
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,286
SAM: Feels like too long.

45
00:02:51,286 --> 00:02:55,582
DARIN: Thank you! And we haven't even started the
episode.

46
00:02:55,582 --> 00:03:02,217
MATT: Perfect. But glad you could join us, Darin.
I play a professional orc

47
00:03:02,217 --> 00:03:07,114
who's going to follow you around
everywhere, trying make sure that you're working

48
00:03:07,114 --> 00:03:10,749
it out. Where are you going, there? I'm going to
cut your throat, bastard! And I

49
00:03:10,749 --> 00:03:17,084
also get to play-- I'm really excited about this,
as a longtime Tolkien fan-- the Witch-king of

50
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:22,658
Angmar, head of the NazgÅ±l. As a person that grew
up reading Tolkien fervently and spending two and

51
00:03:22,658 --> 00:03:27,199
a half years playing a MUD based on Tolkien, and
then, you know, the movies and everything-- huge

52
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,670
honor to be a part of this, let alone such an
iconic character. So, super excited. Super excited

53
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,548
for this game, and those of you who haven't played
the first game, Shadow of Mordor, what's wrong

54
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:41,898
with you? It's legitimately a really fun game and
this one expands even more on how awesome that

55
00:03:41,898 --> 00:03:46,557
was, so super excited. Thank you so much to WB
Games for making this possible. You guys can check

56
00:03:46,557 --> 00:03:50,288
it out, Shadow of War releases October 10th, which
is right around the corner when this is airing,

57
00:03:50,288 --> 00:03:56,266
which is exciting. You can find it at
shadowofwar.com/purchase to go ahead and find out

58
00:03:56,266 --> 00:04:02,080
how to buy and pre-order it if you want to. Also,
a mobile game should be out by now. Shadow of War

59
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,469
has a mobile game for both iOS and Android that
you can get as well, so check that out. But yeah,

60
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:12,049
this whole game is a big celebration of the
upcoming release of Shadow of War. We're stoked to

61
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:18,748
be in it, and we're stoked to have you here.
Without further ado, guys, let's go ahead and dive

62
00:04:18,748 --> 00:04:25,907
into the world of Mordor, shall we? Actually,
before we begin, because we haven't actually

63
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:28,989
established here, do you guys want to talk about
who you're playing in this game?

64
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:34,070
TRAVIS: Oh gosh, I guess we should, being that we
don't even know. We're figuring it out as we go.

65
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,375
Should I start?

66
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,680
LAURA: Yeah, sure!

67
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:46,253
TRAVIS: (high squeaky voice) So I'm playing: I am
Skak Scar-Artist, and I'm a goblin. A trickster.

68
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:54,807
Very creepy! Yeah. I'm a little goblin that's got
a crossbow and a shortsword, and I'm here to run

69
00:04:54,807 --> 00:05:03,380
amok and advance, you know, my efforts against
the horrible humans and elves of the land of

70
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,252
Mordor.

71
00:05:04,252 --> 00:05:07,828
DARIN: This could be my favorite day ever.

72
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:12,730
MATT: I'm already so invested in everything. Thank
you, Travis. Laura?

73
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:19,380
LAURA: Oh. Hi, my name is
Arburuk. I'm the Unbreakable because people have

74
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:30,131
tried but nobody was able to actually break me.
I'm olog-hai, so I'm kind of big. But you know, I

75
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:34,920
don't necessarily want to be a fighter, I'm just
really good at it, you know? Because I'm

76
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,683
unbreakable and all. Yeah.

77
00:05:37,683 --> 00:05:41,660
MATT: Thank you, Laura. Darin?

78
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:51,760
DARIN: There's two things you have to
know about me. My name is Mozuu the Chosen, and

79
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,180
that's it!

80
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,450
SAM: Nice.

81
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,903
LAURA: That was two things!

82
00:05:58,903 --> 00:06:00,513
MATT: And Sam, who are you playing?

83
00:06:00,513 --> 00:06:02,490
SAM: (raspy voice) Hello.

84
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,591
DARIN: You all right, mate?

85
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,250
SAM: (rasping) Hello.

86
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,401
DARIN: We got that part.

87
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:19,977
SAM: My name is Ur-Eden Goodthink, and I'm the
olog you want to see if you're hurt. Because me is

88
00:06:19,977 --> 00:06:21,630
a sawbones.

89
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,029
LAURA: You're an olog, too?

90
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:29,267
SAM: I'm an olog, so I'm rather big. But I'm also
a sawbones, which means if you have a toothache

91
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:34,602
or something, you come to me, I pull the tooth
right out. Probably half of your jaw, too. If you

92
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:43,135
got a broken bone, I pull the arm off. If you got
a rash, I pull your skin off. So really, I take

93
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:52,190
care of all your medical needs. Somebody came to
me with-- they were having some stress dreams. I

94
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,269
ripped their head off. Solved the problem right
away!

95
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:57,741
TRAVIS: Great outpatient.

96
00:06:57,741 --> 00:07:06,967
SAM: Yeah. Usually most things can be solved
without insurance. But yeah, I'm here to help

97
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:11,192
anyone who gets injured, and also to kill some
man-filth.

98
00:07:11,192 --> 00:07:25,311
MATT: Perfect. So. Players and audience, welcome
to Mordor. Chosen as the base to Sauron's foothold

99
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:31,332
in the Second Age, these broken, ashen lands to
the southeast of Middle-earth lay guarded by

100
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:38,020
towering mountain ranges, ever dark beneath
stormclouds and volcanic smoke spewed from within

101
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:45,741
the fiery depths of Orodruin, or Mount Doom. Here
in the Third Age, the once-thought-destroyed Dark

102
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:53,181
Lord regains his strength, grows his armies, and
prepares for his vengeance on the world of man and elves.

103
00:07:53,181 --> 00:08:02,422
You, friends, are soldiers and warriors under this
shadowed banner. Whether Uruk- or Olog-hai, you've

104
00:08:02,422 --> 00:08:06,742
been raised and trained in the savage pits and
fields of these lands, given purpose amongst the

105
00:08:06,742 --> 00:08:13,422
ranks of Sauron's great army, taught to slaughter,
to devour, to outsmart and destroy all who would

106
00:08:13,422 --> 00:08:19,421
oppose his will, or be punished for your
insolence. You relish the thought of sinking your

107
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:24,421
blades into elf-flesh, eager for the chance to
prove yourself and rise among your fellow uruk to

108
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:30,981
command greater power-- and the rewards that come
with it, of course. However, such a path is not as

109
00:08:30,981 --> 00:08:34,272
easy as the daydream would lead you to believe.

110
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:40,122
Now, you four have spent months stationed on the
outskirts of the watch-fortress of Nargaroth, on

111
00:08:40,122 --> 00:08:46,801
the eastern edge of the massive Plateau of
Gorgoroth, many miles southeast of Mount Doom. As

112
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:52,381
part of the Marauder tribe, you've been sent on a
few raids here and there, between here and the Sea

113
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:56,773
of Nurnen, scrounging up what meager spoils are
left when the bulk is brought to the feet of your

114
00:08:56,773 --> 00:09:05,031
war-chief, Barfta the Blood Pike. While you both
dislike and respect his greed, you've seen him

115
00:09:05,031 --> 00:09:10,443
carve every challenger to his position to pieces
as a show of power. You hope to show him your

116
00:09:10,443 --> 00:09:16,734
worth and achieve greatness under his specific
banner. At least, that would help you with your

117
00:09:16,734 --> 00:09:22,959
limited access to quality meats or being sent out
on aimless patrols that try your patience. Maybe

118
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,604
one day.

119
00:09:24,604 --> 00:09:29,642
For now, you sit amongst the rowdy riff-raff of
the common tables in the fort courtyard, drinking

120
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:34,823
from watered-down grog as you all celebrate a
fairly unimpressive crushing of a not-too-far-away

121
00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:42,212
ghul mound. You four have bonded out of a need for
allies, for boredom here leads to violence, and

122
00:09:42,212 --> 00:09:48,353
it's good to have friends when the brawls begin.
The late afternoon sees fading off what specter of

123
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:53,558
sunlight ever finds itself in Mordor, and the
smell of burnt meats and blood fills the air.

124
00:09:53,558 --> 00:09:58,602
Welcome.

125
00:09:58,602 --> 00:10:08,540
You hear the clanking of glasses and partially
cracked mugs nearby. The cheers and rowdy screams

126
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:14,853
and yells of various half-drunken uruk in your
vicinity, (shouting). You see two guys in the back

127
00:10:14,853 --> 00:10:18,373
far corner that are in the middle of a fist-fight
with a small crowd gathering, but it's too measly

128
00:10:18,373 --> 00:10:23,483
for your attention. You all sit here, staring into
your cups, contemplating your existence.

129
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:25,756
TRAVIS: (high-pitched whining)

130
00:10:25,756 --> 00:10:29,995
LAURA: What's the matter, Skak?

131
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:32,544
TRAVIS: I'm just bored, that's all.

132
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:38,364
SAM: Do you want to go with me to kill something?
Would that break your boredom?

133
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:42,021
TRAVIS: Is that an option? We could do that, now?

134
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:46,164
SAM: Well, those two fellows having the fist
fight, we could go kill one of them.

135
00:10:46,164 --> 00:10:47,619
TRAVIS: Ooh!

136
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:52,685
SAM: I think it's Rarr versus Oog, over there.

137
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:56,554
TRAVIS: Naw, I think it's Oog, and it's actually
Oop-tha.

138
00:10:56,554 --> 00:10:58,225
SAM: You could be right.

139
00:10:58,225 --> 00:10:59,864
TRAVIS: Yeah, you get them easily confused.

140
00:10:59,864 --> 00:11:01,304
LAURA: They look a lot alike.

141
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:04,353
SAM: Yeah, they do. All the uruks do.

142
00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:10,753
DARIN: Is that what you really want? You just want
to fight and bleed for nothing, or do we want

143
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,911
gold? Ain't that what we're after?

144
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:15,334
LAURA: I like gold!

145
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:24,122
DARIN: Of course you like gold. We all like gold!
And I say we find it. While they're fighting and

146
00:11:24,122 --> 00:11:32,715
they're dying for nothing, we make our way up and
we rule this world, eh?

147
00:11:32,715 --> 00:11:35,584
LAURA: But I thought Barfta ruled this world.

148
00:11:35,584 --> 00:11:44,093
DARIN: There's two things you have to know about
Barfta. One, he <i>thinks</i> he rules! And that's it.

149
00:11:44,093 --> 00:11:47,264
TRAVIS: He keeps doing this, with the two things.

150
00:11:47,264 --> 00:11:48,524
DARIN: What?

151
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:51,454
TRAVIS: Nothing. You're always-- I'm a fan of gold
as well.

152
00:11:51,454 --> 00:11:57,034
DARIN: Well said, my friend. You see this gold
helmet that I stole?

153
00:11:57,034 --> 00:11:58,474
LAURA: Is that gold?

154
00:11:58,474 --> 00:12:04,247
DARIN: Of course it's gold! Don't mind the
man-filth head on the pike on the helmet, ha!

155
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:12,064
That's ornamentation. But you know what you
aren't? You aren't the head of man-filth on my

156
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:18,795
helmet. You're alive. And while we're alive, we
make a difference. Eh?

157
00:12:18,795 --> 00:12:20,551
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's true.

158
00:12:20,551 --> 00:12:27,039
MATT: It's that exact moment that a heavy nudge
slaps into the back of Mozuu. You watch a

159
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:33,771
familiar, lanky, nasty-looking uruk with large,
broken teeth and a wiry physicality slamming into

160
00:12:33,771 --> 00:12:39,385
him, his large cup of thick, brackish grog
spilling over and across your shoulder as he spins

161
00:12:39,385 --> 00:12:45,405
around to stare down at you, Mozuu. You recognize
this as Hoshgrish Bootlick.

162
00:12:45,405 --> 00:12:47,945
SAM: Hoshgrish?

163
00:12:47,945 --> 00:12:54,535
MATT: Hoshgrish Bootlick. He turns around. "What
you doing, bumping my drink, lob?"

164
00:12:54,535 --> 00:12:59,924
LAURA: It's Hoshgrish. He's such a bully.

165
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:02,526
DARIN: Come here. Come closer, Hoshgrish.

166
00:13:02,526 --> 00:13:06,574
MATT: "Oh, I'm doing just fine right here! Will
you go ahead and refill my drink!" And he puts his

167
00:13:06,574 --> 00:13:08,935
cup right on the table in front of you.

168
00:13:08,935 --> 00:13:15,036
DARIN: Skak! Refill his drink while I have a
little word with Hoshgrish.

169
00:13:15,036 --> 00:13:20,303
TRAVIS: Not a problem. Could I have, could you
hand me--? It's really high up there, right.

170
00:13:20,303 --> 00:13:21,960
DARIN: You're ruining the moment, Skak!

171
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,770
TRAVIS: Okay! I've got it!

172
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:28,600
DARIN: What's your problem, mate? We're just sitting
here having a little discussion. You wander up

173
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,131
drunkenly, you bump into me! At least you didn't
get wine on the helmet. And now you're looking for

174
00:13:34,131 --> 00:13:38,549
trouble? Is that what you're looking for,
Hoshgrish Bootlick?

175
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:43,800
MATT: As he wipes the bit of spittle from the
bottom of his pointed, jagged chin, he looks down

176
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:51,927
at you with a sly grin, his overbite curling back
as it exposes with the smile. "Heh heh! You

177
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:59,466
"obviously haven't seen the last one who bumped
into me when I was drinking! So you want to start

178
00:13:59,466 --> 00:14:06,830
"a problem? Please, be my guest." He takes a few
steps back and you watch as his hands go down to

179
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:11,847
pull two jagged, black blades from the side. He
spins and tosses them in the air and catches them.

180
00:14:11,847 --> 00:14:17,060
LAURA: Hey. You mess with Mozuu, you mess with
me.

181
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:25,311
MATT: "Well look here, I don't have any sort of a
problem with you, friend olog, but you understand.

182
00:14:25,311 --> 00:14:29,608
"I've had my drink disrespected and I'll take a
head for that!"

183
00:14:29,608 --> 00:14:34,839
LAURA: Oh. Oh! Oh, well, he was, his drink was
disrespected, that's all it is.

184
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:36,517
MATT: "Thank you."

185
00:14:36,517 --> 00:14:38,975
DARIN: Skak, you got that drink for him yet?

186
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:40,878
TRAVIS: Was I supposed to do that?

187
00:14:40,878 --> 00:14:42,457
DARIN: Yes.

188
00:14:42,457 --> 00:14:45,921
TRAVIS: Yeah, hold on one more second.

189
00:14:45,921 --> 00:14:54,870
DARIN: We'll refill your drink, friend, but know,
they call me Mozuu the Chosen because Sauron spoke

190
00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:01,283
to me. You know what he said? "The strong take
what they want."

191
00:15:01,283 --> 00:15:04,441
MATT: "The Dark Lord spoke to you?"

192
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:06,453
DARIN: Aye, he did. That's--

193
00:15:06,453 --> 00:15:11,604
MATT: "What a load of serak!" He puts his blades
back in, like now disinterested, completely shut

194
00:15:11,604 --> 00:15:13,699
off from the conversation. "Give me my drink."

195
00:15:13,785 --> 00:15:15,229
TRAVIS: Yeah, here you go.

196
00:15:15,273 --> 00:15:22,385
MATT: "Thank you. 'Mozuu the Chosen.'" Turns
around and starts walking away.

197
00:15:22,385 --> 00:15:27,159
SAM: Is that true? Did Sauron really talk to you?

198
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:32,093
DARIN: Of course it's true. Everything I say is
true, except the things that ain't, but that is true.

199
00:15:32,093 --> 00:15:37,531
SAM: Because sometimes I hear voices, but then I
turn around and it's just an orc talking to me

200
00:15:37,531 --> 00:15:39,098
that I didn't see.

201
00:15:39,098 --> 00:15:41,165
LAURA: Sometimes I'm talking to you, sometimes
but--

202
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:42,508
SAM: Yeah, but I didn't see you.

203
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,899
LAURA: Yeah. Sometimes. Because your helmet blocks
the view, you know.

204
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:47,007
SAM: Yeah, that's the problem with these things.

205
00:15:47,007 --> 00:15:51,291
DARIN: We all hear voices when people are talking
in our general vicinity, but this was in my head.

206
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,457
This was in my head, I heard it.

207
00:15:53,457 --> 00:15:55,368
LAURA: What's he sound like?

208
00:15:55,368 --> 00:16:03,866
DARIN: Well, scary. Large. And he sounds like
Sauron. He sounds like a Dark Lord. He sounds like

209
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:05,717
someone who should be obeyed.

210
00:16:05,717 --> 00:16:07,218
SAM: You know what he sounds like to me?

211
00:16:07,218 --> 00:16:08,178
DARIN: What?

212
00:16:08,178 --> 00:16:12,528
SAM: A medical condition. I should probably get my
axe, chop up your head, and see what's in there

213
00:16:12,528 --> 00:16:13,530
making that noise.

214
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,072
LAURA: Maybe just the top of it.

215
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:21,573
DARIN: Wait. There's two things you should do with
that axe. One, put it away. And that's it.

216
00:16:21,573 --> 00:16:23,029
SAM: All right.

217
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:24,928
LAURA: He's so good at math.

218
00:16:24,928 --> 00:16:32,042
MATT: As this conversation's taking place, you
hear this massive, echoing explosion right over

219
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:37,530
your shoulders as you see a flash of light and
heat brighten the courtyard around you. Everyone

220
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:42,420
in the vicinity looks up past. You can see one of
the three large towers that sits in the courtyard

221
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:49,753
of this fortress. The tower of Warchief Barfta is
currently in flames, his chamber being burned as

222
00:16:49,753 --> 00:16:55,097
the thatch and mud that comprises its exterior are
beginning to burn. You can see now everyone's

223
00:16:55,138 --> 00:16:59,588
mobilizing around you, grabbing weapons as a
series of arrows come arcing in from over one of

224
00:16:59,588 --> 00:17:03,925
the walls. Three or four nearby uruk go (dying
sounds) and fall to the ground, dead immediately.

225
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:07,508
LAURA: I take a helmet off one and put it in my
bag.

226
00:17:07,508 --> 00:17:10,319
MATT: All right, what are you guys doing?

227
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,439
TRAVIS: I take out a crossbow, do I see any
intruders?

228
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,101
MATT: Perception check, please.

229
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:18,577
LAURA: Isn't that where Barfta lives up there?

230
00:17:18,577 --> 00:17:19,687
SAM: Yes.

231
00:17:19,687 --> 00:17:21,195
LAURA: And it's on fire?

232
00:17:21,195 --> 00:17:22,285
TRAVIS: 12!

233
00:17:22,285 --> 00:17:26,529
MATT: 12, okay! You glance around rapidly and you
see people running back and forth and you can see

234
00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:33,068
guards along the wall, but the guards are firing
inward. You see three or four uruk up on the edge

235
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:37,821
of the perimeter wall that are currently loading
up their crossbows or shortbows and are ready to

236
00:17:37,821 --> 00:17:40,456
fire another volley into the crowd currently
drinking.

237
00:17:40,456 --> 00:17:44,231
TRAVIS: I don't understand! Those are uruk! Why
are they firing at us?

238
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,157
LAURA: Because they need to die!

239
00:17:46,157 --> 00:17:49,709
SAM: Let's go get them!

240
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:50,872
TRAVIS: Yeah!

241
00:17:50,872 --> 00:17:55,606
SAM: Let's go! I pick up my quarterstaff and start
stomping towards the tower.

242
00:17:55,606 --> 00:17:58,010
LAURA: Ditto with my maul.

243
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,063
MATT: All righty. You follow as well?

244
00:18:01,063 --> 00:18:02,948
DARIN: I follow, behind them.

245
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:04,977
SAM: That's where good leaders go.

246
00:18:04,977 --> 00:18:06,296
DARIN: Yes!

247
00:18:06,296 --> 00:18:11,127
MATT: So as Mozuu's picking up the rear you can
see other goblins and uruk rushing past. You see

248
00:18:11,127 --> 00:18:15,289
another volley get loosed towards it. I need all
of you to make dexterity saving throws, please.

249
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:16,357
LAURA: Oh no!

250
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:18,939
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!

251
00:18:18,939 --> 00:18:24,218
LAURA: What did you get?

252
00:18:24,218 --> 00:18:25,361
TRAVIS: One.

253
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:27,509
SAM: I also got a one.

254
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:28,875
LAURA: Oh no!

255
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,473
MATT: Off to a great start!

256
00:18:30,473 --> 00:18:31,418
DARIN: Ten!

257
00:18:31,418 --> 00:18:32,420
MATT: Ten, all right!

258
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,368
LAURA: 14.

259
00:18:33,368 --> 00:18:37,702
MATT: All right. Both Mozuu and Arburuk manage
to--

260
00:18:37,702 --> 00:18:39,854
LAURA: You can call me Arby.

261
00:18:39,854 --> 00:18:47,254
MATT: Arby. Mozuu and Arby, rushing forward, you
manage to get behind Arby as the heavy plates of

262
00:18:47,254 --> 00:18:52,008
armor that surround your large, troll-like form,
the arrows smash against. You two not so lucky.

263
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:58,079
You both suffer six points of piercing damage as a
series of bolts or arrows stick into your chest

264
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,978
and shoulders. You flex and tear them off as you
rush forward towards the side of the tower before

265
00:19:02,978 --> 00:19:06,064
you now, the smoke billowing off the top of the
inferno.

266
00:19:06,064 --> 00:19:13,985
LAURA: I step in front of Skak here to try to
block him from any more arrows coming. I'm a

267
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:16,825
defender, you know.

268
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:19,108
SAM: I could have used my Deflect Missiles! I'll
do that next time!

269
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:23,029
TRAVIS: You need to be on your game! Come on!

270
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:27,221
MATT: All right! So as you guys are rushing
forward now, the crowd swarming up behind you, you

271
00:19:27,221 --> 00:19:34,335
glance over to the right and you can see pouring
out of the back side of this tower, three very

272
00:19:34,335 --> 00:19:40,539
brutish-looking uruk with bulging muscles. They
have dark helmets on and this faint glow in their

273
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:46,677
eyes as they charge in and start cleaving into
nearby allies of yours that were drinking not a

274
00:19:46,677 --> 00:19:47,850
moment ago.

275
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,588
TRAVIS: Am I far enough away to pick one off with
my crossbow?

276
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:51,934
MATT: Go for it! Make an attack.

277
00:19:51,934 --> 00:19:53,968
TRAVIS: Okay! Crossbow, 1d8.

278
00:19:53,968 --> 00:19:57,380
LAURA: I know what those are! This is cool, Matt!

279
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,080
TRAVIS: Oh, that's good! That is 11.

280
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,589
MATT: 11.

281
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:07,666
TRAVIS: No, no, no! 16.

282
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,402
LAURA: That's not close at all!

283
00:20:10,402 --> 00:20:12,230
TRAVIS: I know, it's way off.

284
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,501
MATT: I'll consider that in character.

285
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:14,729
TRAVIS: Thank you.

286
00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:16,061
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

287
00:20:16,061 --> 00:20:23,858
TRAVIS: Yes! d8. That's a 15.

288
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:25,549
MATT: 15 damage?

289
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:31,569
TRAVIS: Well, 1d8 plus four. So nope, that's
wrong. That's a six. Six damage.

290
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:36,101
MATT: It is currently in a scuffle with somebody,
so I'll let you get sneak attack damage if you

291
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,271
want to.

292
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:39,529
LAURA: Whoa, you're a roguey rogue!

293
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,468
TRAVIS: 3d6?

294
00:20:40,468 --> 00:20:41,468
MATT: 3d6, yeah.

295
00:20:41,468 --> 00:20:42,890
TRAVIS: Holy smokes!

296
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,091
LAURA: He gets 3d6?

297
00:20:44,091 --> 00:20:47,778
TRAVIS: Five, six, ten. 11 total. Sneak attack.

298
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:53,521
MATT: All right, so on top of the six, 17. So you
watch as this one orc grunt, rushing forward,

299
00:20:53,521 --> 00:20:57,822
takes its battleaxe and jams it right into the
clavicle of one of the nearby Uruk. Its weapon

300
00:20:57,822 --> 00:21:02,711
falls out of its hand. As it looks up, towards
you, with a flash in its eyes, (gurgle), the bolt

301
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:07,240
goes straight into its throat. (gurgle) It begins
to bleed out its black dark ichor, before it falls

302
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,798
to the ground, not moving.

303
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:09,998
TRAVIS: Got one!

304
00:21:09,998 --> 00:21:13,815
LAURA: Nice going, Skak! I run forward and try to
do the same thing to another one.

305
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:18,768
MATT: Okay. I will actually ask you three, since
he got the jump on him, two other existing ones

306
00:21:18,768 --> 00:21:20,760
are now charging towards you, to roll initiative
real fast.

307
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,669
SAM: 21.

308
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:26,089
LAURA: Oh shit. 18.

309
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:30,339
DARIN: What do I add to my roll? 12.

310
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:35,535
MATT: All righty. So we have Ur-Eden, we have
Arby.

311
00:21:35,535 --> 00:21:38,086
SAM: You can call me Eden.

312
00:21:38,086 --> 00:21:40,940
DARIN: You can call me Mozuu the Chosen.

313
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,239
MATT: There we go.

314
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:44,375
TRAVIS: There's only two things you need to call me.

315
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:51,358
DARIN: Mozuu the Chosen, and that's it. Will this
be a theme? Yes it will.

316
00:21:51,358 --> 00:21:56,387
MATT: So Ur-Eden, you're up first. There are two
of these grunts that are rushing forward, both

317
00:21:56,387 --> 00:22:00,800
dual-handing battleaxes, and they're charging in.
(guttural shout)

318
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,034
SAM: All right, I'll pick up my quarterstaff with
two hands, and I will hit one of them.

319
00:22:05,034 --> 00:22:06,368
MATT: Go for it!

320
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:12,506
SAM: (laughs) The one on the left. Hiyah! Ooh, not
good. 11!

321
00:22:12,506 --> 00:22:18,219
MATT: 11. Nope! You swing, and it ducks low, and
it's going to come up with an upward strike. Do

322
00:22:18,219 --> 00:22:19,460
you have another attack?

323
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,598
SAM: I have a second attack.

324
00:22:20,598 --> 00:22:21,960
MATT: All right, attack again.

325
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,350
SAM: Ooh, this one is better! 26!

326
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,197
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

327
00:22:26,197 --> 00:22:36,380
SAM: All right. 1d8 plus four. I don't know how to
do this. Okay, that's eight points of damage. But!

328
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:43,817
Let's do other things, too. I'm going to use my
Stunning Strike, right?

329
00:22:43,817 --> 00:22:45,811
MATT: All right, so you spend a ki point to stun
him.

330
00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:50,805
SAM: I'm going to use a ki point. Yes. 14.

331
00:22:50,805 --> 00:22:56,891
MATT: 14, no, he gets an 11. So he is stunned.
Describe the Stunning Strike for me.

332
00:22:56,891 --> 00:23:02,277
SAM: Okay. The Stunning Strike. So when I hit him,
I, knowing my medical knowledge that I have so

333
00:23:02,277 --> 00:23:07,421
well, I aim for the one place that I know hurts
the most: the wang.

334
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:11,992
DARIN: Would you like to act it out?

335
00:23:11,992 --> 00:23:13,291
SAM: On you.

336
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,957
DARIN: Oh no, wait! I'm wearing a suit.

337
00:23:14,957 --> 00:23:18,980
SAM: So I jab him right between the legs.

338
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,651
MATT: What's the uruk term for that, by the way?

339
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:22,184
SAM: Oh, right in the gronk.

340
00:23:22,184 --> 00:23:23,455
MATT: There we go.

341
00:23:23,455 --> 00:23:29,881
SAM: Right in the gronk. Sharply hit. Nice and
low. Gronk hit!

342
00:23:29,881 --> 00:23:34,907
MATT: It barely manages to maintain grip on the
battleaxe, but right now is doubled over, knees

343
00:23:34,907 --> 00:23:39,987
knocked inward, in a bad place. Currently not able
to sustain any sort of combat motive.

344
00:23:39,987 --> 00:23:42,334
SAM: Take that, you glob!

345
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:47,450
MATT: (groans) There's no words. That ends your
turn?

346
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,192
SAM: I believe so. Oh, wait, a bonus. I don't know
how this guy works.

347
00:23:51,192 --> 00:23:53,092
LAURA: Does he stay stunned for a turn?

348
00:23:53,092 --> 00:23:55,856
MATT: You get a free bonus action strike if you
want to, with your fist.

349
00:23:55,856 --> 00:23:58,177
SAM: Bonus action strike?

350
00:23:58,177 --> 00:23:59,244
MATT: Yeah.

351
00:23:59,244 --> 00:24:00,184
SAM: You can do that?

352
00:24:00,184 --> 00:24:01,014
MATT: Yeah.

353
00:24:01,014 --> 00:24:06,732
SAM: All right, great. I will. If I hit a stunned
person, does he become unstunned? No.

354
00:24:06,732 --> 00:24:10,462
MATT: Sorry, that's the Flurry of Blows with your
Ki point, if you wanted to spend another one.

355
00:24:10,462 --> 00:24:12,004
SAM: Oh, no, I'm good. I'm done.

356
00:24:12,004 --> 00:24:14,758
LAURA: But if you hit a guy that's stunned, does
he become unstunned?

357
00:24:14,758 --> 00:24:17,654
MATT: No. But attacks against him have advantage.

358
00:24:17,654 --> 00:24:19,113
LAURA: Tight.

359
00:24:19,113 --> 00:24:21,593
MATT: All right. So next up is Arby. Arby, what are
you going to do?

360
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:26,754
LAURA: I'm going to run up and hit the guy that he
hit between the legs with my maul.

361
00:24:26,754 --> 00:24:28,344
MATT: So as he's like (groans).

362
00:24:28,344 --> 00:24:30,003
LAURA: I hit him like a batter.

363
00:24:30,003 --> 00:24:34,763
MATT: The eyes glance up to meet yours, just as you go
for the giant golf swing.

364
00:24:34,763 --> 00:24:37,842
LAURA: That's a 15 to hit.

365
00:24:37,842 --> 00:24:39,579
MATT: You have advantage on this strike, don't
forget.

366
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:40,667
LAURA: Because he's stunned.

367
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:41,807
MATT: Yep.

368
00:24:41,807 --> 00:24:46,724
LAURA: That's a 19 to hit. No, that's wrong, that
was a 17 to hit.

369
00:24:46,724 --> 00:24:48,534
MATT: (laughs) That's okay.

370
00:24:48,534 --> 00:24:49,714
LAURA: Does it still hit?

371
00:24:49,714 --> 00:24:50,690
MATT: Yes.

372
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,449
LAURA: Yeah! Okay, let's see.

373
00:24:55,449 --> 00:25:00,444
MATT: Actually, sorry, with the staff, you still
can do a bonus action strike if you want to.

374
00:25:00,444 --> 00:25:03,193
SAM: Oh. That's crazy! I already took two hits.

375
00:25:03,193 --> 00:25:07,859
MATT: Two hits, and bonus action you can get a
third. Or spend a Ki point and get a fourth as well.

376
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:13,928
SAM: Can I jab at the guy next to me? All right,
sorry, Laura, I'm interfering.

377
00:25:13,928 --> 00:25:15,129
MATT: Damage?

378
00:25:15,129 --> 00:25:16,566
LAURA: 12 on the first hit.

379
00:25:16,566 --> 00:25:22,967
MATT: The guy who's stunned, you knock him a good
15 feet in the air with an arc. (shout) His

380
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:27,596
crumpled body lands on the large wooden spikes of
the wall that you see some of the archers are on above

381
00:25:27,596 --> 00:25:29,939
and is stuck on there, impaled.

382
00:25:29,939 --> 00:25:34,165
LAURA: That was artistic. Is there another guy?

383
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:36,114
SAM: Are you the scar artist?

384
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:39,311
TRAVIS: No, that's me! I'm the Scar-Artist!

385
00:25:39,311 --> 00:25:41,095
LAURA: Do you have something else you have to do?

386
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:42,586
SAM: I was just jabbing the other guy.

387
00:25:42,586 --> 00:25:43,954
MATT: What did you roll for that?

388
00:25:43,954 --> 00:25:45,814
SAM: I rolled a 23.

389
00:25:45,814 --> 00:25:47,390
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

390
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:50,425
SAM: Another eight points.

391
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:52,597
MATT: All right. And then you.

392
00:25:52,597 --> 00:25:54,132
LAURA: And there's another guy I can hit?

393
00:25:54,132 --> 00:25:56,142
MATT: Same guy that he's attacking, so there's two
more that weren't destroyed.

394
00:25:56,142 --> 00:26:00,048
LAURA: Oh no. That might not. 11.

395
00:26:00,048 --> 00:26:05,256
MATT: Unfortunately, from hitting the first guy,
it's already telegraphed your next swing against the

396
00:26:05,256 --> 00:26:07,934
other. He sidesteps it, passes by.

397
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:10,885
LAURA: It's because I wasn't looking at him. I was
looking at the beauty on the spike over there.

398
00:26:10,885 --> 00:26:16,818
MATT: Indeed. He's going to rush up to you with
his battleaxe and make a strike towards you, who

399
00:26:16,818 --> 00:26:19,918
destroyed his friend. That's going to be an 18.

400
00:26:19,918 --> 00:26:23,118
LAURA: That is my armor class.

401
00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:29,778
MATT: So it manages to hit you. You suffer 11
points of slashing damage.

402
00:26:29,778 --> 00:26:33,366
LAURA: Oh no! I'm going to use my reaction to
reduce the damage.

403
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:36,087
MATT: You're using your Troll's Endurance?

404
00:26:36,087 --> 00:26:37,997
LAURA: Yeah, but can I only do that once?

405
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:39,407
MATT: Once per short rest.

406
00:26:39,407 --> 00:26:40,576
LAURA: Oh, really?

407
00:26:40,576 --> 00:26:41,507
MATT: Yeah.

408
00:26:41,507 --> 00:26:43,017
TRAVIS: You better pick the time you want to use
it.

409
00:26:43,017 --> 00:26:44,189
LAURA: Okay, I'm not going to do that just yet.

410
00:26:44,189 --> 00:26:48,680
MATT: Okay, you take 11 points of slashing damage as the
battleaxe comes down, slamming between two plates

411
00:26:48,723 --> 00:26:57,425
of armor and embedding itself somewhere in your
torso. Mozuu, your turn.

412
00:26:57,425 --> 00:27:00,139
DARIN: There's one or two left?

413
00:27:00,139 --> 00:27:02,158
MATT: There's one left, who's been partially
wounded.

414
00:27:02,158 --> 00:27:08,898
DARIN: I think I'd like to use Bane and hold him.
That will stop him in his tracks, will it?

415
00:27:08,898 --> 00:27:11,059
MATT and DARIN: It may.

416
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:12,766
SAM: Such a thinker, this one.

417
00:27:12,766 --> 00:27:19,108
DARIN: Because I shouted to him in a very powerful
way. I speak for Sauron.

418
00:27:19,108 --> 00:27:22,279
MATT: What's the spell DC?

419
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:25,298
DARIN: The spell DC: 11.

420
00:27:25,298 --> 00:27:33,123
MATT: Okay, no. Nine minus one, so that's an
eight. You can have up to three creatures of your

421
00:27:33,123 --> 00:27:37,340
choice, if you want to. The range is 30 feet,
though, so it's pretty close. He's the only one

422
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:42,662
you can see. As you stare at him, he looks fearful
for a moment and you can see the hand shaking.

423
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:49,662
What's going to happen is you get to subtract 1d4 from
any of his rolls.

424
00:27:49,662 --> 00:27:54,633
LAURA: I am going to use Troll's Endurance because
if it's once per short rest, then it's okay, right?

425
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:56,142
MATT: Sure!

426
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:57,776
LAURA: Yeah! I'm going to do it.

427
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,198
MATT: So roll your d12.

428
00:28:00,198 --> 00:28:05,919
LAURA: Ooh! Eight plus two, so I only take one
point of damage!

429
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,422
MATT: One point of slashing damage. You shrug it
off. It goes through the plates of the armor, hits

430
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:14,542
the skin and gets a minute in there, and you flex
your abs. They're so strong!

431
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:16,502
LAURA: They're so strong!

432
00:28:16,502 --> 00:28:18,312
TRAVIS: Nice, Arby!

433
00:28:18,312 --> 00:28:22,382
LAURA: Thanks! That's why I'm Unbreakable; this is
why!

434
00:28:22,382 --> 00:28:24,473
MATT: Does that end your turn?

435
00:28:24,473 --> 00:28:25,383
DARIN: Yes.

436
00:28:25,383 --> 00:28:29,433
MATT: With that, another volley of crossbow bolts
and arrows comes flying over. You can see maybe a

437
00:28:29,433 --> 00:28:35,651
dozen flying from the wall. Other Uruk are
climbing to try and head these guys off in the

438
00:28:35,651 --> 00:28:39,331
distance. I need you all to make another dexterity
saving throw.

439
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:44,535
SAM: 21!

440
00:28:44,535 --> 00:28:47,687
LAURA: Six!

441
00:28:47,687 --> 00:28:49,064
TRAVIS: 22.

442
00:28:49,064 --> 00:28:53,024
MATT: Both of you guys manage to dodge out of the
way. However, both of you take five points of

443
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:57,145
piercing damage as a bolt or arrow hits each of
you in the shoulder or back.

444
00:28:57,145 --> 00:29:01,244
LAURA: Mine hit the back; yours hit the shoulder.

445
00:29:01,244 --> 00:29:02,575
DARIN: Thanks.

446
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:03,686
LAURA: Yeah.

447
00:29:03,686 --> 00:29:05,312
DARIN: There's two things you have to know about
where that arrow hit.

448
00:29:05,312 --> 00:29:13,036
MATT: You guys are now at the base of the tower.
You hear a smaller explosion, muffled. More

449
00:29:13,036 --> 00:29:17,735
smoke's billowing out the side. It's a rather
large chamber that he lives in and it looks like

450
00:29:17,735 --> 00:29:23,885
about half of it is engulfed in flames, the side
nearest to the entrance. You guys rush up the

451
00:29:23,885 --> 00:29:27,404
stairs to head up the side of the tower? Or do you
find another way around?

452
00:29:27,404 --> 00:29:30,372
SAM: Are there any other ways around? Are there
ladders?

453
00:29:30,372 --> 00:29:34,445
DARIN: Did we defeat the one that we held?

454
00:29:34,445 --> 00:29:38,508
MATT: No, it's still standing there. What are you
going to do; are you going to fight that guy or

455
00:29:38,508 --> 00:29:39,678
keep moving?

456
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:41,486
LAURA: Let's fuck that guy up.

457
00:29:41,486 --> 00:29:42,895
MATT: Then Eden, you're up first.

458
00:29:42,895 --> 00:29:49,679
SAM: Oh. We're going to beat this guy? I'm
ignoring this guy; I'm going to charge into the

459
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,204
stairwell.

460
00:29:51,204 --> 00:29:53,443
TRAVIS: Go up the tower! Go!

461
00:29:53,443 --> 00:29:58,319
MATT: Attack of opportunity against you. That is a
15. What's your armor class?

462
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:00,505
SAM: Does he have to roll a negative four?

463
00:30:00,505 --> 00:30:04,049
MATT: He has to minus d4 from him. So go ahead and
roll a d4.

464
00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:09,485
DARIN: That is a three.

465
00:30:09,485 --> 00:30:10,904
MATT: That's a 12.

466
00:30:10,904 --> 00:30:12,362
SAM: He does not hit me.

467
00:30:12,362 --> 00:30:17,685
MATT: The axe swings wide and you start darting up
the steps. Up next would be Arby.

468
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:18,889
LAURA: I'm going to try to hit him.

469
00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:19,905
MATT: Go for it.

470
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:25,348
TRAVIS: What about me? I thought I was at the top
of the round, right?

471
00:30:25,348 --> 00:30:26,729
MATT: Oh, that's right!

472
00:30:26,729 --> 00:30:30,054
TRAVIS: You know, because I went first with the
sneak attack.

473
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:34,394
DARIN: It was your height, we overlooked you
because you're the smallest of the group

474
00:30:34,394 --> 00:30:38,753
apparently. You're a wee thing.

475
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:42,554
TRAVIS: Can I run up and draw my shortsword, two
hands, and try and stick it in?

476
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:46,472
MATT: Yeah you can, actually. So you toss the
crossbow over your shoulder, rush in blade out.

477
00:30:46,472 --> 00:30:50,946
Make an attack. With advantage, because he is
currently--

478
00:30:50,946 --> 00:30:52,524
TRAVIS: 19.

479
00:30:52,524 --> 00:30:55,072
MATT: All right, roll damage on that with sneak
attack.

480
00:30:55,072 --> 00:30:56,524
TRAVIS: Shortsword, 1d6.

481
00:30:56,524 --> 00:30:58,759
LAURA: And I'm standing next to him.

482
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:03,013
TRAVIS: Sneak attack, five, six, ten--

483
00:31:03,013 --> 00:31:04,275
SAM: Sneak attack?

484
00:31:04,275 --> 00:31:09,904
TRAVIS: Yeah. Because somebody's within melee. 12
points of damage to his gut!

485
00:31:09,904 --> 00:31:18,268
MATT: With that, as he's currently standing there
swinging wide, missing Eden as he rushes past, he

486
00:31:18,268 --> 00:31:23,841
begins to give chase. At that point his body
stiffens up as the blade sinks right into the back

487
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:27,471
of the spine. You drag it down through the
shoulder blades, and as it brings his arms forward

488
00:31:27,471 --> 00:31:30,982
it kind of opens the wound. He crumples to the
ground, not moving.

489
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:33,921
TRAVIS: A beautiful scar to add to my collection.

490
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:36,781
DARIN: How many does this make?

491
00:31:36,781 --> 00:31:40,321
TRAVIS: It makes 30.

492
00:31:40,321 --> 00:31:42,139
DARIN: Excellent.

493
00:31:42,139 --> 00:31:46,423
(laughter)

494
00:31:46,423 --> 00:31:48,537
SAM: Come on, you shugs, come with me up the
stairs!

495
00:31:48,537 --> 00:31:51,492
DARIN: Wait a minute, who's the leader of this
group?

496
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,762
TRAVIS: You are.

497
00:31:52,762 --> 00:31:54,302
LAURA: Barfta.

498
00:31:54,302 --> 00:31:56,033
DARIN: Of this group, of us four!

499
00:31:56,033 --> 00:31:58,500
LAURA: Well, I was thinking I could lead?

500
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,222
TRAVIS: As a collective? Do we vote? Is it
democracy?

501
00:32:01,222 --> 00:32:05,772
DARIN: This is a democracy in which I lead. Let's
go up the stairs, as he said.

502
00:32:05,772 --> 00:32:06,988
TRAVIS: Okay.

503
00:32:06,988 --> 00:32:07,892
DARIN: Good.

504
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:10,658
MATT: All right, the rest of you catch up. You're
faster than the rest, so you dart up towards the

505
00:32:10,658 --> 00:32:15,885
top of the stairs. Partway up the stairway, as you
rush around the corner, you see an even more

506
00:32:15,885 --> 00:32:23,723
muscular orc standing there right before you. No
helmet on, fury and this faint gray glow to the

507
00:32:23,723 --> 00:32:32,453
eyes. Swinging wide with a giant, two-handed
hammer, goes swinging towards you. And gets two

508
00:32:32,453 --> 00:32:38,562
attacks, but the first one, a natural two, misses
the first one. And a natural one for the second

509
00:32:38,562 --> 00:32:44,178
one. Swings wide once, and then swings a second
time and you put your foot out and trip him, and

510
00:32:44,178 --> 00:32:47,867
as you do he stumbles forward and the hammer
actually slams into the side of the tower. It

511
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:52,802
wedges itself into the stonework as it's cracked
and broken inward. And is currently trying to pull

512
00:32:52,802 --> 00:32:54,453
its weapon out of the stonework.

513
00:32:54,453 --> 00:33:01,033
SAM: Oh, that looks like a problem. I will solve
it! I will attack him with my quarterstaff. Ten

514
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:02,995
plus seven, ooh, 17.

515
00:33:02,995 --> 00:33:05,112
MATT: 17 hits, go ahead and roll damage.

516
00:33:05,112 --> 00:33:12,608
SAM: Yes! So that hit goes for, ooh, 12 points,
and you said he looked stronger than the rest?

517
00:33:12,608 --> 00:33:13,573
MATT: Yes.

518
00:33:13,573 --> 00:33:16,566
SAM: I will use my Flurry of Blows.

519
00:33:16,566 --> 00:33:18,283
MATT: Okay, so you get three more attacks on him.

520
00:33:18,283 --> 00:33:29,556
SAM: I would like to flurry! 19 plus seven!

521
00:33:29,556 --> 00:33:31,685
MATT: That hits, roll damage on that.

522
00:33:31,685 --> 00:33:38,432
SAM: That's another nine points of damage. 20,
natural 20!

523
00:33:38,432 --> 00:33:41,042
DARIN: Well flurried, friend!

524
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:43,642
MATT: Go ahead and roll your dice, double it.

525
00:33:43,642 --> 00:33:44,884
SAM: One.

526
00:33:44,884 --> 00:33:47,254
MATT: So two?

527
00:33:47,254 --> 00:33:55,133
SAM: That's two plus four. So that's six. And then
one more. Six plus seven is only a 13.

528
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:59,494
MATT: 13 just barely hits, doesn't have a lot of
armor on him.

529
00:33:59,494 --> 00:34:02,372
SAM: Eight plus four, another 12 points of
damage!

530
00:34:02,372 --> 00:34:09,701
MATT: So how do you want to do this? You finish
this guy off. With these four strikes, as he's

531
00:34:09,701 --> 00:34:12,723
currently trying to wrestle his weapon from the
side of the tower, how do you finish him?

532
00:34:12,723 --> 00:34:14,164
SAM: Like Zorro.

533
00:34:14,164 --> 00:34:15,513
DARIN: Who?

534
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:17,693
LAURA: Who's that?

535
00:34:17,693 --> 00:34:26,263
SAM: He was this glob that I killed two towns
over. He would always write a Z on his victims.

536
00:34:26,263 --> 00:34:36,395
But my name is Eden? So I'm going to try and write
an E. (grunts)

537
00:34:36,395 --> 00:34:43,214
MATT: With an exposed muscular torso, it takes a
lot of pressure to try and cut someone with a

538
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:49,026
quarterstaff. However, you thankfully as an
olog-hai are a very strong creature by nature, and

539
00:34:49,026 --> 00:34:56,377
in a horrible display, you break the skin and
force an E across his body with your

540
00:34:56,377 --> 00:34:57,434
quarterstaff.

541
00:34:57,434 --> 00:34:59,113
SAM: Can I make a lowercase E?

542
00:34:59,113 --> 00:35:08,634
MATT: Sure! With that, he looks down at the E and
you just push him off the edge of the stairs and

543
00:35:08,634 --> 00:35:12,084
he tumbles. You hear this lower-pitched Wilhelm
scream.

544
00:35:12,084 --> 00:35:15,180
SAM: (roaring)

545
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:20,161
DARIN: Ur-Eden, keep him alive! We need to
question him!

546
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:23,364
SAM: He committed suicide.

547
00:35:23,364 --> 00:35:26,914
DARIN: As they all do when they see your might.

548
00:35:26,914 --> 00:35:28,975
SAM: He said he was so scared of you, Mozuu!

549
00:35:28,975 --> 00:35:37,682
DARIN: Oh, yeah, there's two things people do when
they're scared of me. Commit suicide, and that's it!

550
00:35:37,682 --> 00:35:43,065
MATT: At which point you guys have now caught up
to the back of Ur-Eden, and you guys climb up the

551
00:35:43,065 --> 00:35:46,756
rest of the stairs. You can now look over the side
of the walls, and you can see a number of the

552
00:35:46,756 --> 00:35:53,770
uruk within this fortress have now overtaken a lot
of the marauding, arriving traitors that had begun

553
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:58,594
to attack. And it seems like most of the
uprising's being quelled, however no one has

554
00:35:58,594 --> 00:36:00,150
gotten to the tower as quick as you.

555
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:07,185
SAM: Do the uprisers, the rebels, look different?
Do they have anything different about them in

556
00:36:07,185 --> 00:36:08,405
their eyes?

557
00:36:08,405 --> 00:36:15,264
MATT: Other than the occasional flash in the eyes,
nothing else seems to catch your attention.

558
00:36:15,264 --> 00:36:19,785
However, as you get to the top of the stairs
around this tower, you're looking at the entrance.

559
00:36:19,785 --> 00:36:24,576
The door's partially broken inward and flames
have completely wreathed the entrance to this

560
00:36:24,605 --> 00:36:30,258
chamber. It's really hot and you immediately
recoil at the blaze before you. How do you wish to

561
00:36:30,258 --> 00:36:31,334
proceed?

562
00:36:31,334 --> 00:36:33,026
LAURA: Is Barfta in there?

563
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:35,329
SAM: That's where he slumbers.

564
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:36,890
LAURA: And it's on fire?

565
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,866
SAM: We should probably go in.

566
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:41,176
DARIN: If we rescue him, we're heroes.

567
00:36:41,176 --> 00:36:44,974
MATT: You hear a (muffled yelling) from behind the
wall on the inside.

568
00:36:44,974 --> 00:36:47,606
LAURA: Barfta, is that you?

569
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:55,035
DARIN: Yes, tell us if it's you. If it's you say,
"This is Barfta, I'm on fire!" If you're not on

570
00:36:55,035 --> 00:36:58,425
fire, say-- You know, just say whatever you like.

571
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:02,645
MATT: There's a brief pause before you hear again
(muffled yelling).

572
00:37:02,645 --> 00:37:05,065
LAURA: I don't know if that was Barfta.

573
00:37:05,065 --> 00:37:08,998
DARIN: That was not following my directions.
Therefore, I do not know if we should enter--

574
00:37:08,998 --> 00:37:11,376
LAURA: Maybe we should break the door down to see
who it is?

575
00:37:11,376 --> 00:37:12,484
DARIN: Break it down.

576
00:37:12,484 --> 00:37:13,930
LAURA: I try to break it down.

577
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,065
MATT: All right, make an attack.

578
00:37:16,065 --> 00:37:18,635
LAURA: 17 plus eight!

579
00:37:18,635 --> 00:37:24,646
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll damage! With your
giant maul, you slam down with this gargantuan

580
00:37:24,646 --> 00:37:26,286
hammer into the burning wood.

581
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:31,449
LAURA: I get to reroll ones! Ten plus five, 15!

582
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:37,477
MATT: 15 points of damage, crack! Most of the door
breaks down. It's still barely holding on to the

583
00:37:37,477 --> 00:37:41,547
bottom hinge, but it now gives you a full view of
the inside. You do suffer four points of fire

584
00:37:41,547 --> 00:37:46,117
damage due to the proximity to the flame, however
you have opened an entryway to the chamber.

585
00:37:46,117 --> 00:37:52,825
Looking inside, you can see flames have taken the
entire western side of the chamber. You can see a

586
00:37:52,825 --> 00:37:57,416
lot of the silks that he keeps-- For the point
here, as the leader of this portion of the

587
00:37:57,416 --> 00:38:02,331
marauder tribe, Barfta likes nice things. Even
glancing inside you've gotten little glimpses of

588
00:38:02,331 --> 00:38:09,687
the inside of his chamber here and there, and you
can see gold spoils adorning taken cabinets and

589
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:16,728
boxes and crates left around. There's just a large
pile of somewhat loosely comfortable materials

590
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:20,854
that you scoff at the idea of such comfort, but
silently in the back of your head, you're like, I

591
00:38:20,854 --> 00:38:22,057
bet that's nice.

592
00:38:22,057 --> 00:38:23,767
LAURA: Can we see where Barfta is in here?

593
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:29,264
MATT: You do actually see the far wall is an open
hole, destroyed by one of the earlier detonations.

594
00:38:29,264 --> 00:38:34,667
You can see the entry point was the other side of
this tower. You see numerous ruined bodies of

595
00:38:34,667 --> 00:38:40,907
uruk, like the one that you saw guarding the
stairway on the way up, are now littering the

596
00:38:40,907 --> 00:38:45,677
floor, near that opening in the window. And there
in the center you see Warchief Barfta, muscles

597
00:38:45,677 --> 00:38:51,776
swollen in rage. He kneels amidst these bodies,
repeatedly slamming his fist into the face of a

598
00:38:51,776 --> 00:38:58,948
still-living would-be assassin, who's now on the
ground just being clutched by the throat (roars).

599
00:38:58,948 --> 00:39:02,458
He's just like gone feral in his face at this
point.

600
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:05,650
LAURA: Does he look like he's in trouble? Does he
look hurt?

601
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,000
TRAVIS: Injured? On fire?

602
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,657
MATT: Make a perception check.

603
00:39:08,657 --> 00:39:14,408
LAURA: I'm very perceptive. 15.

604
00:39:14,408 --> 00:39:19,019
MATT: Glancing in, you can see he looks wounded on
one arm, one arm looks like it has a few gashes,

605
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:24,397
but for the most part seems to be not too worse
for wear. As soon as the door bashes in, he's like

606
00:39:24,397 --> 00:39:28,584
growling at this one uruk on the ground who's
partially broken with one eye swollen shut.

607
00:39:28,584 --> 00:39:33,158
Glances over, looks in your direction,
"What're you doing? Get in and help!"

608
00:39:33,158 --> 00:39:38,950
LAURA: Okay, I try to break through the rest of
the door.

609
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:43,732
MATT: Okay, so make an athletics check. Since
you've already ruined most of its structure, this

610
00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:46,160
is more of a just pushing the rest of it out of
the way.

611
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,180
LAURA: Oh, no. Oh, I have really good athletics!
12.

612
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,722
TRAVIS: It's nice, isn't it?

613
00:39:52,722 --> 00:39:55,309
LAURA: Yeah, oh my god! I'm so strong!

614
00:39:55,309 --> 00:40:01,100
MATT: You manage to take the rest of your hammer
and smash through the remains of the door. You do

615
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:05,270
suffer another two points of fire damage in the
process, but you've cleared the entryway and no

616
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:09,589
one else will suffer fire damage passing through
the entryway. You all step into the center of the

617
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:13,741
chamber and there the warchief is still clutching
his assassin on the ground and he's grinning and

618
00:40:13,741 --> 00:40:22,680
going, "You stupid shrak, who sent you? What fool
dares raise arms against me?" The assassin

619
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:31,191
(gurgles). Spits in his face. Looks back at the
rest of you with this look of rage in his eyes.

620
00:40:31,191 --> 00:40:38,691
The Warchief, "You there, make yourself useful and
get my information!" He throws the wounded

621
00:40:38,691 --> 00:40:45,390
assassin at your feet who tumbles. He
starts coughing and trying to get up.

622
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:50,262
LAURA: Oh, I step on him, but not to kill him, to
hold him in place.

623
00:40:50,262 --> 00:40:57,251
MATT: A very big foot right on his chest, he's now
like pinned on the ground pushing against the

624
00:40:57,251 --> 00:41:03,142
foot, but not able to get any ground. He's looking
up at you, eyes wide from the pressure.

625
00:41:03,142 --> 00:41:05,400
(coughing)

626
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,260
LAURA: Can you answer some questions for us,
please?

627
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,989
TRAVIS: Why are you being so polite?

628
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:15,346
LAURA: Oh, no. I scream in his face. Somebody ask
him questions.

629
00:41:15,404 --> 00:41:25,827
DARIN: I'll walk over, I'll get real close to him.
Hello friend, my name is Mozuu the Chosen. I've

630
00:41:25,827 --> 00:41:37,477
heard the voice of Sauron. He told me the strong
take what they want. You see all this around here?

631
00:41:37,477 --> 00:41:47,316
That could be part of yours if you're strong
enough. You tell us why, why you'd do this, and

632
00:41:47,316 --> 00:41:50,404
riches await you.

633
00:41:50,404 --> 00:41:51,697
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

634
00:41:51,697 --> 00:41:53,067
LAURA: Is that the truth?

635
00:41:53,067 --> 00:42:03,784
DARIN: Shush. Oh, I'm bad at dice. Miss. 15 plus--
Where is my thing?

636
00:42:03,784 --> 00:42:04,986
SAM: Persuasion, right?

637
00:42:04,986 --> 00:42:07,718
DARIN: Oh, 18.

638
00:42:07,718 --> 00:42:18,532
MATT: 18. He calms down for a minute and smiles at
you. You can see that same weird gray flash in his

639
00:42:18,532 --> 00:42:25,731
eyes. "You'll get nothing from me. Death comes for
you all."

640
00:42:25,731 --> 00:42:30,826
DARIN: Death comes for us all, friend, it just
depends on when. It doesn't have to come for you

641
00:42:30,826 --> 00:42:34,258
today. Riches can be yours.

642
00:42:34,258 --> 00:42:42,660
MATT: "Look, I was sent by Ur-Gram the
Face-Eater."

643
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,463
SAM: Ur-Grandma?

644
00:42:45,463 --> 00:42:54,829
MATT: Ur-Gram the Face-Eater. "See, he survived
his duel in the wastes east of here under a new

645
00:42:54,829 --> 00:43:03,144
"lord. They have many under their banner. We was
sent to take this fort, we was, and succeed we

646
00:43:03,144 --> 00:43:14,467
"would have, and we will again soon. Nargroth is
next. Enjoy your heads while you still got them."

647
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:22,237
LAURA: I start looking around the room and forget
that I'm actually standing on him and I put my

648
00:43:22,237 --> 00:43:24,011
full weight down.

649
00:43:24,011 --> 00:43:26,402
MATT: (gargled screaming)

650
00:43:26,402 --> 00:43:29,438
LAURA: Oh, does that hurt?

651
00:43:29,438 --> 00:43:34,742
DARIN: We thank you for your information. Arby,
eat his face.

652
00:43:34,742 --> 00:43:37,938
LAURA: I don't actually like the taste of--

653
00:43:37,938 --> 00:43:40,610
DARIN: Okay, that was a good moment and I was like
threatening him.

654
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,614
LAURA: I'll just finish stepping on him.

655
00:43:42,614 --> 00:43:52,040
MATT: Heavy stomp. Just this watermelon splatter
of Uruk head against the stonework. The flames

656
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:56,433
still burning around. The Warchief seems less
frustrated.

657
00:43:56,433 --> 00:44:00,362
DARIN: Your problem was solved, Warchief. We
interrogated.

658
00:44:00,362 --> 00:44:03,501
TRAVIS: I'm just carving little scars into the
dead body.

659
00:44:03,501 --> 00:44:12,359
MATT: The Warchief has now sat down on the ground,
back slumped against the pile of rags and cloth

660
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:19,128
that he sleeps on and pulls a bottle of spoiled
wine and uncorks it. Begins to wash the open

661
00:44:19,128 --> 00:44:22,979
wounds on the arm, takes a swig.

662
00:44:22,979 --> 00:44:26,959
SAM: Oh, oh yes, do you need medical attention, my
lord?

663
00:44:26,959 --> 00:44:30,980
MATT: "Does it look like I need medical
attention?"

664
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:33,764
SAM: Yes.

665
00:44:33,764 --> 00:44:35,798
MATT: "Then fix me!"

666
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:50,650
SAM: All right, I grab my healer's kit and I will
use my really dirty bandages to wrap him up. I

667
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:55,950
don't really have anything to fasten it with so I
hock a loogie on one and then fasten it to the

668
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:58,097
other piece and hope that holds.

669
00:44:58,097 --> 00:45:01,340
MATT: Perfect, okay, roll your healing.

670
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:07,276
SAM: Oh yes, 1d6 plus nine. 12 points.

671
00:45:07,276 --> 00:45:16,240
MATT: All right. So as you bend, take them, and:
"Yeah." He was like, (grunts, then breathes).

672
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:27,245
"Ur-Gram leaves and wants to take my fort, does
he? Wants to wallow in my shadow, does he? That

673
00:45:27,245 --> 00:45:36,073
"sniveling orog's going to taste a <i>hundred blades</i>
before he falls, I say. Am I right?"

674
00:45:36,073 --> 00:45:37,593
SAM and TRAVIS: Yeah.

675
00:45:37,593 --> 00:45:39,628
DARIN: Do you have a hundred blades?

676
00:45:39,628 --> 00:45:42,138
MATT: "I've got more than a hundred blades!"

677
00:45:42,138 --> 00:45:46,707
DARIN: How many exactly <i>do</i> we have? Do we ever
count? Is there someone in charge to count the

678
00:45:46,707 --> 00:45:47,673
blades?

679
00:45:47,673 --> 00:45:50,795
MATT: "Your job now is to count the blades."

680
00:45:50,795 --> 00:45:53,042
DARIN: We have two blades.

681
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:54,834
LAURA: You are so good at-- oh, counting.

682
00:45:54,834 --> 00:46:01,242
DARIN: Yeah, I am very good at counting. That's
why they call me Mozuu the Chosen.

683
00:46:01,242 --> 00:46:02,460
MATT: "Mozuu?"

684
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,590
DARIN: The Chosen.

685
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:04,829
MATT: "And who chose you?"

686
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:05,990
DARIN: Sauron.

687
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:12,463
MATT: (laughs) "Stupid. What's your names, then?
Who's your commander?"

688
00:46:12,463 --> 00:46:15,884
SAM: We follow Barfta-- oh wait, that's you.

689
00:46:15,884 --> 00:46:21,141
MATT: "That's right. You follow <i>me</i>!"

690
00:46:21,141 --> 00:46:22,442
SAM and LAURA: Yes.

691
00:46:22,442 --> 00:46:24,419
MATT: (shouting) "What's your name?"

692
00:46:24,419 --> 00:46:26,321
DARIN: Mozuu the Chosen.

693
00:46:26,321 --> 00:46:32,865
SAM: My name's Ur-Eden. Ur-Eden Goodthink. You
can call me Eden.

694
00:46:32,865 --> 00:46:41,561
LAURA: I'm Arb-Uruk, the Unbreakable. But you
can call me Arby.

695
00:46:41,561 --> 00:46:49,862
TRAVIS: Oh, powerful Barfta! I am lowly Skak the
Scar-Artist, to serve you.

696
00:46:49,862 --> 00:47:00,712
MATT: "All right. You seem to be an able-bodied
lot. You want to show your Warchief what <i>real</i>

697
00:47:00,712 --> 00:47:03,204
"uruk are made of?"

698
00:47:03,204 --> 00:47:07,480
DARIN: Is this before or after I count the
blades?

699
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,489
MATT: "After."

700
00:47:09,489 --> 00:47:10,591
DARIN: Good.

701
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:16,392
MATT: "Yeah? Then go!" (gulps)

702
00:47:16,392 --> 00:47:17,932
LAURA: Where are we going again?

703
00:47:17,932 --> 00:47:29,912
MATT: "I'm getting there! Head east. Find where
Ur-Gram is hiding, tell me where and I'll reward

704
00:47:29,912 --> 00:47:38,952
"you. Bring me back his head, I'll shoot you all
straight to captains, with your own roots beneath you."

705
00:47:38,952 --> 00:47:41,342
TRAVIS: Captains!

706
00:47:41,342 --> 00:47:47,036
MATT: "Now hurry! Before the tracks go cold! Go!"

707
00:47:47,036 --> 00:47:52,682
DARIN: Again, you asked me to count blades, and
yet now--

708
00:47:52,682 --> 00:47:55,553
MATT: "Count them quickly! I don't care!"

709
00:47:55,553 --> 00:47:57,354
TRAVIS: It's a figure of speech, Mozuu.

710
00:47:57,354 --> 00:48:01,963
DARIN: I'll say there's more than a hundred. We're
going. We will bring you glory and we will bring

711
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:03,331
you his head.

712
00:48:03,331 --> 00:48:09,481
MATT: "Good. Hundred swords. Heh."

713
00:48:09,481 --> 00:48:15,638
TRAVIS: Can I run across the room to the hole that
was blown in the other side of the room, check for

714
00:48:15,638 --> 00:48:18,854
clues or how they did it, or if there's any trace
of who came in?

715
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:23,160
MATT: Make an investigation check in the vicinity,
and then a perception check looking through the hole.

716
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:33,132
LAURA: While he's doing that, can I walk over to
Eden and say, I got burned a little in the door.

717
00:48:33,132 --> 00:48:37,753
SAM: All right. Do you need some healing, then?

718
00:48:37,753 --> 00:48:39,915
LAURA: Don't take my skin off, though.

719
00:48:39,915 --> 00:48:45,685
TRAVIS: 25 on the investigation, and an eight on
the perception.

720
00:48:45,685 --> 00:48:52,584
MATT: Okay! Looking through the hole that is
blasted into the side of this wall, there is a

721
00:48:52,584 --> 00:49:00,011
number of crumpled uruk, you see there are two
assassins on the ground, both with ruined forms,

722
00:49:00,011 --> 00:49:04,092
seemingly the explosion that they brought here
also blew them apart. The style you can

723
00:49:04,092 --> 00:49:16,256
appreciate. But you do see they have-- somehow through this
explosion, three small encased leather-bound orbs

724
00:49:16,256 --> 00:49:22,753
that survived the detonation. You take and sniff
it, it's a very familiar smell of powder.

725
00:49:22,753 --> 00:49:28,314
TRAVIS: Explodey powder? Can I pocket those
three?

726
00:49:28,314 --> 00:49:29,484
MATT: You do indeed. Yeah.

727
00:49:29,484 --> 00:49:30,749
LAURA: Oh, that's cool.

728
00:49:30,749 --> 00:49:32,334
MATT: What was your perception check?

729
00:49:32,334 --> 00:49:33,628
TRAVIS: It's an eight.

730
00:49:33,628 --> 00:49:39,775
MATT: An eight. You glance out past the hole, to
the dark hills in the distance. Nothing.

731
00:49:39,775 --> 00:49:47,089
TRAVIS: It's real blurry. Of you all, who has really good
like, you know, eyeballs?

732
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:52,408
LAURA: I don't know if they're good or not, but I've
got some eyeballs.

733
00:49:52,497 --> 00:49:54,404
TRAVIS: Can you see anything out here?

734
00:49:54,404 --> 00:50:00,464
LAURA: I bring out my patch of eyeballs. Which kind
did you need, because I got little eyeballs and

735
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,076
bigger eyeballs?

736
00:50:02,076 --> 00:50:04,079
TRAVIS: How long have you been holding those?

737
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,375
SAM: Some of those aren't eyeballs, by the way.

738
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:10,694
LAURA: Oh, that's a piece of lint, you're right.
What--

739
00:50:10,694 --> 00:50:14,435
(yelling and laughing)

740
00:50:14,435 --> 00:50:16,366
LAURA: The eagles! The eagles are coming!

741
00:50:16,366 --> 00:50:20,965
(laughing)

742
00:50:20,965 --> 00:50:22,036
MATT: That was amazing!

743
00:50:22,036 --> 00:50:24,274
TRAVIS: Are you Gandalf? Oh shit.

744
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:25,793
DARIN: It's the magic of Mordor!

745
00:50:25,793 --> 00:50:27,496
SAM: I think we should follow you now!

746
00:50:27,496 --> 00:50:30,766
LAURA: I'm the chosen one! I'm the chosen!

747
00:50:30,766 --> 00:50:37,735
DARIN: That was Sauron made flesh!

748
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:40,310
TRAVIS: Amazing.

749
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:42,775
LAURA: Yeah, so...no?

750
00:50:42,775 --> 00:50:44,135
TRAVIS: Put those away.

751
00:50:44,135 --> 00:50:46,586
LAURA: Ow, but that made my hands hurt worse,
please.

752
00:50:46,586 --> 00:50:52,384
SAM: All right, I could heal you right now, or we
could use hit dice and take a short rest and that way

753
00:50:52,384 --> 00:50:56,088
I would save my ability to heal you later.

754
00:50:56,088 --> 00:50:59,259
LAURA: All right. Oh yeah, and then I get my
troll's endurance back!

755
00:50:59,259 --> 00:51:02,555
MATT: "So! Maggots!"

756
00:51:02,555 --> 00:51:04,336
SAM: Oh, you're still here!

757
00:51:04,336 --> 00:51:07,315
ALL: Sorry, sorry!

758
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:13,265
SAM: If we're going to do this for you by the Dark
Lord's name, I feel that our group of four should

759
00:51:13,265 --> 00:51:16,436
have some sort of group name.

760
00:51:16,436 --> 00:51:18,456
TRAVIS: Ooh! Like a callsign!

761
00:51:18,456 --> 00:51:21,266
SAM: Yeah, a callsign or something. Is that
something you could hook us up with?

762
00:51:21,266 --> 00:51:23,526
MATT: "I mean..."

763
00:51:23,526 --> 00:51:26,127
LAURA: Do you have like fancy pins or something we
could wear?

764
00:51:26,127 --> 00:51:29,686
SAM: Or the Orc Four! The Orc Four! The Forcs!

765
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:33,376
ALL: The Forcs! The Forcs!

766
00:51:33,376 --> 00:51:38,086
MATT: "No. All right, Forcs it is!"

767
00:51:38,086 --> 00:51:40,356
(cheering)

768
00:51:40,356 --> 00:51:44,057
MATT: "You! Are the Barfta Forcs!"

769
00:51:44,057 --> 00:51:48,757
SAM: Can we get little patches that say "Get
Forc-ed"?

770
00:51:48,757 --> 00:51:53,377
LAURA: Oh, you should, you should just carve it in
because you're a Scar-Artist!

771
00:51:53,377 --> 00:51:55,446
TRAVIS: Yeah, hold on, just one minute!

772
00:51:55,446 --> 00:52:00,251
DARIN: While you do that, I'm going to go count
some blades from this window.

773
00:52:00,251 --> 00:52:01,717
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

774
00:52:01,717 --> 00:52:07,301
DARIN: Okay. 16.

775
00:52:07,301 --> 00:52:12,054
MATT: 16; glancing about over the next five or ten
minutes or so, you just count blades in the

776
00:52:12,054 --> 00:52:17,418
courtyard, and those that are pulling the
bodies of the gathered mutineers and executing

777
00:52:17,418 --> 00:52:23,216
them in the middle of the courtyard; you count
probably a good solid 73-74 blades by your

778
00:52:23,216 --> 00:52:28,727
estimation in immediate visual range. You throw in
some, you know, estimations of non-visual range

779
00:52:28,727 --> 00:52:34,207
based blades, the size of the fortress, probably
something around 125 blades currently available in

780
00:52:34,207 --> 00:52:37,627
just this small encampment outside the main
fortress.

781
00:52:37,627 --> 00:52:49,110
DARIN: By my count, we have 7,321 blades currently
available to us in this fort. We are unbeatable.

782
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:54,703
We find this guy you want, this guy dies.

783
00:52:54,703 --> 00:52:57,547
MATT: "I like you."

784
00:52:57,547 --> 00:52:59,627
DARIN: Well thank you.

785
00:52:59,627 --> 00:53:00,798
MATT: "But get out."

786
00:53:00,798 --> 00:53:02,009
DARIN: Oh! Yeah, right.

787
00:53:02,009 --> 00:53:04,130
TRAVIS: Your shoulder is finished, where do you
want yours?

788
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:05,507
LAURA: My shoulder looks really good.

789
00:53:05,507 --> 00:53:06,668
SAM: Across my back.

790
00:53:06,668 --> 00:53:11,513
MATT: As you're glancing out, you look past the
eastern mountainscape; you can see what are the

791
00:53:11,513 --> 00:53:18,675
Mithram Spur mountains to the east of this
encampment. The shadows of night have been

792
00:53:18,675 --> 00:53:24,728
claiming this vicinity as the sun's faded. You see
a handful of fleeing goblins, just vanishing into

793
00:53:24,728 --> 00:53:29,037
the mountains heading eastward and disappearing
into the shadows at the base.

794
00:53:29,037 --> 00:53:32,457
DARIN: Fleeing? Well, I couldn't probably tell,
the goblins--

795
00:53:32,457 --> 00:53:33,634
MATT: They're running away.

796
00:53:33,634 --> 00:53:35,658
DARIN: In the direction we're headed?

797
00:53:35,658 --> 00:53:36,698
MATT: Yes.

798
00:53:36,698 --> 00:53:38,515
SAM: Let's take on after them.

799
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:45,664
DARIN: Yeah. Because, well, what goblins are
afraid of, no offense to you, we are not afraid

800
00:53:45,664 --> 00:53:51,009
of. We're better than goblins, no offense to you.

801
00:53:51,009 --> 00:53:52,368
TRAVIS: Again, no.

802
00:53:52,368 --> 00:53:53,528
DARIN: Yeah. Are we going?

803
00:53:53,528 --> 00:53:59,809
TRAVIS: No wait, you need your tattoo, yours is
done, it's on the lower back. Where would you like

804
00:53:59,809 --> 00:54:01,084
your Forcs tattoo?

805
00:54:01,084 --> 00:54:02,968
LAURA: You want one on your arm like I got?

806
00:54:02,968 --> 00:54:04,888
DARIN: See this head on my helmet?

807
00:54:04,888 --> 00:54:05,769
TRAVIS: Yeah.

808
00:54:05,769 --> 00:54:14,770
DARIN: Put it up there. Because this will cause
true terror in any goblin, again, no offense to you.

809
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:18,338
TRAVIS: Thank you. We'll get it later, we should
probably get after them.

810
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:22,528
DARIN: Take this helmet and do it as we run! You
are a true artiste.

811
00:54:22,528 --> 00:54:27,497
LAURA: But we got to take a short rest though,
right, while we were getting our tattoos though.

812
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:29,109
Was that a short rest?

813
00:54:29,109 --> 00:54:33,904
MATT: Okay, so you take a short rest outside of
the chambers of Warchief Barfta who has been

814
00:54:33,904 --> 00:54:39,398
trying to get you to leave for the past 20-- the
chamber is just in flames around him, he's just

815
00:54:39,398 --> 00:54:42,363
sitting there drinking like "Leave! Me!"

816
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:50,058
DARIN: We have, technically, we are outside the
room, technically we have left. He agrees.

817
00:54:50,058 --> 00:54:51,871
MATT: "Smartass."

818
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,669
SAM: Do I get ki points back?

819
00:54:53,669 --> 00:54:54,670
MATT: You do.

820
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:55,558
SAM: All?

821
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:56,359
MATT: Yep.

822
00:54:56,359 --> 00:55:00,159
SAM: Holy moly, I'm so powerful! Wow!

823
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:02,539
DARIN: Must we roll to get hit points back?

824
00:55:02,539 --> 00:55:04,678
SAM: Hit dice. It will say right there.

825
00:55:04,678 --> 00:55:06,149
DARIN: Oh! Well, that's nice.

826
00:55:06,149 --> 00:55:08,835
LAURA: What's shrak mean again? Is that a dick?

827
00:55:08,835 --> 00:55:12,191
SAM: No. Shrak is feces.

828
00:55:12,191 --> 00:55:13,918
MATT: Excrement.

829
00:55:13,918 --> 00:55:16,789
LAURA: Okay. A gronk is a dick?

830
00:55:16,789 --> 00:55:26,719
SAM: A gronk is a dick. How will we chase after
these bad guys? Are we going to ride on something,

831
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,529
or should we just walk? Do we need a cart?

832
00:55:28,529 --> 00:55:30,999
TRAVIS: Do we have any mounts available?

833
00:55:30,999 --> 00:55:32,639
DARIN: Do we see any carangors?

834
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:40,040
MATT: You do have, in this encampment, three
carangors, that are caged, feral. They haven't

835
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:44,399
been broken yet. But they are currently caged in
the corner, you could see a few beastmasters that

836
00:55:44,399 --> 00:55:49,030
roam about. As you walk up to approach and take a
look, you see one of them has a pike with this long,

837
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:53,731
slivering piece of meat that has a little bit of
skin on it still, and you think may have belonged

838
00:55:53,765 --> 00:55:58,109
to one of the uruks that just got killed in the
fray and just throws into the cage. Immediately,

839
00:55:58,109 --> 00:56:08,651
this extremely large, hyena dog-like hybrid beast
starts tearing it apart, getting gore everywhere.

840
00:56:08,651 --> 00:56:12,387
TRAVIS: See, I'm afraid that would be us, if we
tried to ride them.

841
00:56:12,387 --> 00:56:14,370
SAM: Are you scared of a carangor?

842
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,087
TRAVIS: Very much so. Yeah, I mean, look at them.

843
00:56:16,087 --> 00:56:18,516
SAM: I've killed so many carangor.

844
00:56:18,516 --> 00:56:20,061
TRAVIS: I haven't.

845
00:56:20,061 --> 00:56:21,537
SAM: I haven't either.

846
00:56:21,537 --> 00:56:26,237
LAURA: You could ride on my back. I could give you
a piggyback ride.

847
00:56:26,237 --> 00:56:29,807
TRAVIS: Not that I need it, but I will accept.

848
00:56:29,807 --> 00:56:34,466
LAURA: Because I think we're too big to ride this
scatagorse.

849
00:56:34,466 --> 00:56:36,838
SAM: The scatagorus?

850
00:56:36,838 --> 00:56:37,957
LAURA: Yeah.

851
00:56:37,957 --> 00:56:40,388
DARIN: Yeah, close enough.

852
00:56:40,388 --> 00:56:44,896
SAM: All right. Well then, we will go on foot.
Right?

853
00:56:44,896 --> 00:56:47,746
LAURA: I don't know. Are we too big?

854
00:56:47,746 --> 00:56:53,215
MATT: I mean, it's a big beast. You can certainly
try.

855
00:56:53,215 --> 00:56:55,821
SAM: Is anyone good with animals?

856
00:56:55,821 --> 00:57:00,661
TRAVIS and DARIN: Nope.

857
00:57:00,661 --> 00:57:04,673
LAURA and SAM: Maybe we should walk.

858
00:57:04,673 --> 00:57:08,338
(laughter)

859
00:57:08,338 --> 00:57:11,972
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
you see one of the beastmasters is by the cage,

860
00:57:11,972 --> 00:57:16,867
looking at you with his head turned to the side,
curious as to what you're talking about. And

861
00:57:16,867 --> 00:57:22,118
immediately, this claw grabs him and pulls him
against the cage, (screaming) as one of the jaws

862
00:57:22,118 --> 00:57:26,548
grabs and tears his shoulder off from the back. He
goes, (grunting). The other uruks start hitting it with

863
00:57:26,548 --> 00:57:30,337
pikes from the side of the cage, to calm it down,
but it's already torn the guy apart. You're like,

864
00:57:30,372 --> 00:57:31,508
this is bad.

865
00:57:31,508 --> 00:57:35,080
DARIN: We're walking, we are walking.

866
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:40,702
MATT: Okay. So as you guys exit the outside of the
fortress on the outskirts of Nargroth, you begin

867
00:57:40,702 --> 00:57:43,898
to make your way eastward towards the mountains,
in the direction where you saw these fleeing

868
00:57:43,898 --> 00:57:47,978
goblins. Who's helming this journey? Who wants to
be tracking eastward?

869
00:57:47,978 --> 00:57:51,458
LAURA: Well, he has the head on his helmet, so he
can probably see farther than the rest of us.

870
00:57:51,501 --> 00:58:01,678
DARIN: Yes, but the eyes are missing. If you gave
me a couple of your eyes, we could stick them in there.

871
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:06,407
LAURA: Here's a couple. They don't match, but
that's all right.

872
00:58:06,407 --> 00:58:11,018
DARIN: It's just eyes. So I'll take out a couple
of the eyes, I take off my helmet, and I put them

873
00:58:11,018 --> 00:58:20,039
in. And now, I am known as Mozuu the Chosen, the
tracker with the helmet that has the head with

874
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:22,127
the eyes in it currently.

875
00:58:22,127 --> 00:58:29,887
LAURA: Upgrade. I'm going to take Skak and I'm
going to sit him on my shoulder.

876
00:58:29,887 --> 00:58:32,209
TRAVIS: (frantic noises)

877
00:58:32,209 --> 00:58:37,029
MATT: As he's slowly carving-- well no, if you
have the helmet on to track, he can't carve into

878
00:58:37,029 --> 00:58:41,702
it as you're moving. So a choice has to be
made.

879
00:58:41,702 --> 00:58:46,891
DARIN: Well, the eyes will be able to see as
you're carving. You tell me what they see, we go

880
00:58:46,891 --> 00:58:48,147
that way.

881
00:58:48,147 --> 00:58:49,741
TRAVIS: I'm to interpret the eyes?

882
00:58:49,741 --> 00:58:53,978
DARIN: Exactly. That what makes us a team! That's
what makes us the Forcs, apparently.

883
00:58:53,978 --> 00:58:58,394
ALL: The Forcs!

884
00:58:58,394 --> 00:59:00,651
MATT: So I want you to make a dexterity check.

885
00:59:00,651 --> 00:59:05,082
TRAVIS: (laughs) That was good. Oh, that's a
million. 22.

886
00:59:05,082 --> 00:59:12,460
MATT: 22. You, of all the scars you've carved
across the group, you saved the best for Mozuu.

887
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:19,941
Even though it's a bumpy ride on the back of an
olog, it's a beautiful display on this helmet.

888
00:59:19,941 --> 00:59:23,112
TRAVIS: It's got mosaic work, filigree! It's
really nice.

889
00:59:23,112 --> 00:59:26,551
MATT: You're really proud of it, and also roll a
perception check, because you're now the person

890
00:59:26,551 --> 00:59:28,050
interpreting the eyes.

891
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:32,412
TRAVIS: Oh good. Minus two. 14.

892
00:59:32,412 --> 00:59:37,422
MATT: 14. Okay. So as you glance about, and you
take a little while, heading forward, you begin to

893
00:59:37,422 --> 00:59:43,146
find the easiest path up the mountainside. As
opposed to having to climb cliff over cliff, you

894
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:49,670
guys eventually hit the base of the Mithram Spur
Mountains, and begin to slowly pull your way up

895
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:55,916
the occasional cliffside, but for the most part,
you've managed to maintain a fairly easy to climb

896
00:59:55,916 --> 01:00:02,402
switchback path that has been walked through this
mountain range a number of times. Make a survival

897
01:00:02,402 --> 01:00:04,221
check for me, please.

898
01:00:04,221 --> 01:00:06,759
LAURA: You hear those people screaming in the
background?

899
01:00:06,759 --> 01:00:08,000
SAM and DARIN: Yes.

900
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,831
TRAVIS: I literally rolled a zero. Two minus two.

901
01:00:11,831 --> 01:00:20,482
MATT: All right. So as you guys begin to curl up
and down the edge of this mountain range, you

902
01:00:20,482 --> 01:00:27,922
can see the large fortress of Nargroth in the
distance, and the outskirts of the one small watch

903
01:00:27,922 --> 01:00:32,101
fortress on the outside of it, the three of which
dot its exterior. The one furthest to the east

904
01:00:32,101 --> 01:00:37,702
that you just came from begins to disappear over
the high mountain spires and now, in the dark

905
01:00:37,702 --> 01:00:44,172
skies, the black of night, just the faint glow of
orange-red in the distance as Mount Doom

906
01:00:44,172 --> 01:00:50,328
occasionally flares up into the clouds ahead. It is
very dark. Thankfully, I believe most of you have

907
01:00:50,328 --> 01:00:51,695
some form of darkvision.

908
01:00:51,695 --> 01:00:53,122
TRAVIS: 60 feet.

909
01:00:53,122 --> 01:00:54,218
LAURA: And torches.

910
01:00:54,218 --> 01:01:01,236
MATT: Yep. Great, so you guys are able to make
your way through, following the wonderful

911
01:01:01,236 --> 01:01:03,002
direction of Skak on top.

912
01:01:03,002 --> 01:01:06,253
TRAVIS: The eyes speak often. They lead us forth.

913
01:01:06,253 --> 01:01:12,527
SAM: I've noticed that one of those eyes is a
wolf's eye, and the other is an acorn. Is that

914
01:01:12,527 --> 01:01:13,883
going to...

915
01:01:13,883 --> 01:01:20,638
TRAVIS: No. Shouldn't make any difference. Both
the land and the beast speak to me through the eyes.

916
01:01:20,638 --> 01:01:24,832
MATT: Leading you with absolute confidence up the
side of this mountain path.

917
01:01:24,832 --> 01:01:31,540
DARIN: Because an acorn is technically a seed.
And you can't spell seed without <i>see</i>.

918
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:34,011
TRAVIS: I don't know if that's right.

919
01:01:34,011 --> 01:01:44,475
DARIN: S-E-E is "see." S-E-E-E-D-D-D-D-D is
"seed." Therefore, you could, if you wanted to.

920
01:01:44,475 --> 01:01:45,756
TRAVIS: Extrapolate.

921
01:01:45,756 --> 01:01:54,962
MATT: And it's at that moment, (laughs) Arby, as
your large foot hits a soft mound of dirt, a large

922
01:01:54,962 --> 01:02:04,555
one, one about maybe 25 or so feet across.
Your foot hits it. The mountain seems to give way

923
01:02:04,585 --> 01:02:10,228
for a moment into a little bit of a plateau, and
there looks to be packed ash and dirt that fills

924
01:02:10,228 --> 01:02:14,406
this small vicinity. And while you were conversing
and listening and following the direction of Skak,

925
01:02:14,406 --> 01:02:16,555
your foot hits this soft mound.

926
01:02:16,555 --> 01:02:21,726
LAURA: Hey, something's down here. It's softer. I
start stomping on it.

927
01:02:21,726 --> 01:02:29,519
MATT: Okay. I would like all of you to make an
intelligence check, please.

928
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:32,456
DARIN: Five.

929
01:02:32,456 --> 01:02:33,389
SAM: Seven.

930
01:02:33,389 --> 01:02:34,399
LAURA: 14.

931
01:02:34,399 --> 01:02:37,876
TRAVIS: 18. This is new for me, guys!

932
01:02:37,876 --> 01:02:40,216
(laughter)

933
01:02:40,216 --> 01:02:45,486
MATT: So as all of you begin to follow suit with
Arby and stomping on the soft dirt, you're like,

934
01:02:45,486 --> 01:02:48,587
wait, we've raided some of these before.

935
01:02:48,587 --> 01:02:53,966
TRAVIS: Wait a second. Yeah, we've all got
experience with this.

936
01:02:53,966 --> 01:02:55,385
LAURA and SAM: What is it?

937
01:02:55,385 --> 01:03:03,516
MATT: You hear this soft growling sound as you
watch these tiny humanoid creatures with long

938
01:03:03,516 --> 01:03:10,382
thin arms and legs, hairless gray skin, begin to
pull their way out of small holes and tunnels in

939
01:03:10,382 --> 01:03:16,227
the sides of this mound. You watch as ghouls began
to emerge now from the recent disturbing of their space.

940
01:03:16,227 --> 01:03:18,934
LAURA: I hate ghouls.

941
01:03:18,934 --> 01:03:26,427
SAM: But the Forcs can take them. Forcs! It's
dinner time!

942
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:30,246
MATT: Because you rolled so high on the intelligence
check, you do know that they have a hard time with

943
01:03:30,322 --> 01:03:33,356
bright light. However, I would like you all to
roll initiative because they are immediately

944
01:03:33,356 --> 01:03:35,780
lunging towards you. (snarls)

945
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:38,927
TRAVIS: Remember, they have a hard time with
bright light!

946
01:03:38,927 --> 01:03:42,707
SAM: (laughs) Thank you, Lady Guinevere.

947
01:03:42,707 --> 01:03:44,979
(laughter)

948
01:03:44,979 --> 01:03:46,777
LAURA: You had a torch, right, in your hand?

949
01:03:46,777 --> 01:03:49,968
DARIN: We're using darkvision. Some of us.

950
01:03:49,968 --> 01:03:51,247
SAM: Totally black.

951
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:53,393
DARIN: Yep. Let's go back in time. Did anyone--

952
01:03:53,393 --> 01:03:56,758
LAURA: I did mention torches, but I didn't say I
pulled it out.

953
01:03:56,758 --> 01:04:00,325
MATT: You can see four of them have emerged, and
it looks like more are making their way out. So.

954
01:04:00,325 --> 01:04:04,539
All right, initiative order. What do you have?

955
01:04:04,539 --> 01:04:06,719
DARIN: 11.

956
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:08,254
SAM: 17.

957
01:04:08,254 --> 01:04:09,680
LAURA: 11.

958
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:13,090
TRAVIS: 18.

959
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:15,131
ALL: Ooh.

960
01:04:15,131 --> 01:04:24,121
MATT: All right. Skak, you're up first. As you
kept the helmet in your hand, you're like

961
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:25,372
(hesitating).

962
01:04:25,372 --> 01:04:26,842
TRAVIS: How far away are they?

963
01:04:26,842 --> 01:04:31,605
MATT: There are two of them that are ten feet from
you now, rushing in your direction, and a few that are

964
01:04:31,605 --> 01:04:35,303
about 25 or 30 feet on the other side of the
mound that are now climbing over it and

965
01:04:35,339 --> 01:04:39,171
darting towards you. You move first, though, so
there's nobody quite in range or no one who's

966
01:04:39,171 --> 01:04:41,065
attacking you yet.

967
01:04:41,147 --> 01:04:48,872
TRAVIS: I would like to take out one of my acid
vials, and I'm going to throw it from atop

968
01:04:48,872 --> 01:04:53,016
your shoulders at the two ghouls coming forward.

969
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:54,949
MATT: Perfect. Okay, then.

970
01:04:54,949 --> 01:04:57,233
TRAVIS: Using Acid Splash.

971
01:04:57,233 --> 01:05:05,441
MATT: So as you chuck it out, there are two of
them that are side by side that are emerging on

972
01:05:05,441 --> 01:05:08,467
the opposite side within range, so you could
probably hit them both. So I need you to go ahead

973
01:05:08,467 --> 01:05:15,392
and roll-- actually, no, it's a dexterity saving
throw on their point. Okay, so strangely enough,

974
01:05:15,392 --> 01:05:24,089
they both succeed. An 18 and a 20. You throw it,
and they're so fast as they dart past. They're

975
01:05:24,089 --> 01:05:29,172
small and they're wiry and they're lively, and as
soon as you throw and lob it, the both just separate

976
01:05:29,172 --> 01:05:33,383
and it splashes harmlessly on the ground below them.
You see the acid burn up. No effect, unfortunately.

977
01:05:33,383 --> 01:05:38,467
TRAVIS: Can I use my bonus action to nimble
escape, and I want to jump off your shoulders and hide.

978
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:43,325
MATT: Sure, yeah. So we'll say you dart off, and
go ahead and roll a stealth check.

979
01:05:43,325 --> 01:05:47,725
TRAVIS: Nice. 20.

980
01:05:47,725 --> 01:05:52,095
MATT: Okay! Good to know. So that's you. You're
hidden. That ends Skak's turn. Eden, you're up.

981
01:05:52,095 --> 01:05:55,732
SAM: So there's two close together and two
others?

982
01:05:55,732 --> 01:06:00,523
MATT: Well, they've now separated a little bit.
There's four now rushing right in the front, and

983
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:03,699
they're somewhat close. You can get in between two
of them and hit both.

984
01:06:03,699 --> 01:06:05,163
LAURA: Do we all have darkvision?

985
01:06:05,163 --> 01:06:06,712
MATT: I believe you do, yeah.

986
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:12,402
SAM: And my flurry of blows, can that be used on
multiple targets? All right, so I'll run up to the

987
01:06:12,402 --> 01:06:15,557
first and quarterstaff attack.

988
01:06:15,557 --> 01:06:17,073
MATT: Go for it.

989
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:19,828
SAM: Ooh, yeah. 23 to hit.

990
01:06:19,828 --> 01:06:22,058
MATT: 23 hits, yeah. Go ahead and roll damage.

991
01:06:22,058 --> 01:06:25,328
SAM: Seven.

992
01:06:25,328 --> 01:06:32,741
MATT: Seven points? All righty. So as you rush up
and-- by the way, as an olog-hai, you're a big

993
01:06:32,741 --> 01:06:38,230
troll-like entity. The quarterstaff in your hands
is like that long. It's like a tiny little baton.

994
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:46,313
You smack it, and you dislocate its shoulder. And
it gives a horrible pained sound as it does so. It's

995
01:06:46,313 --> 01:06:50,044
hurt pretty bad. These things are not very hardy,
there's just a lot of them.

996
01:06:50,044 --> 01:06:53,459
SAM: All right. I will flurry of blows and strike
him with my hand.

997
01:06:53,459 --> 01:06:54,881
MATT: All right. Go for it.

998
01:06:54,881 --> 01:06:57,751
SAM: Ew, 11.

999
01:06:57,751 --> 01:07:03,378
MATT: 11 does not hit, unfortunately. You're too
confident at this point. As you swing a second

1000
01:07:03,378 --> 01:07:05,389
time, it ducks below, missing.

1001
01:07:05,389 --> 01:07:10,460
SAM: I'll strike again with my hand. (yelps) Oh,
that one's better. 19.

1002
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:12,050
MATT: 19. Go ahead and roll damage.

1003
01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:16,771
SAM: Six points of damage.

1004
01:07:16,771 --> 01:07:20,266
MATT: And with that, you slam down and crumple its
head into its shoulder. It makes

1005
01:07:20,266 --> 01:07:25,669
this gurgle sound as it falls to the ground. And
there's one who's now rushing up behind you that

1006
01:07:25,669 --> 01:07:27,869
you can move into and get your final attack, if
you want.

1007
01:07:27,869 --> 01:07:29,720
SAM: With my hand, right? My bonus--

1008
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,379
MATT: Hand, or your staff.

1009
01:07:31,379 --> 01:07:33,929
SAM: All right. Well, then I will quarterstaff him
in the gut!

1010
01:07:33,929 --> 01:07:36,489
MATT: All right, go for it. So you run up and use
that momentum.

1011
01:07:36,489 --> 01:07:38,858
SAM: Oh yeah! 18 plus seven. Ooh! 25.

1012
01:07:38,858 --> 01:07:40,528
MATT: That hits. Yeah, roll damage.

1013
01:07:40,528 --> 01:07:45,748
SAM: One. So five.

1014
01:07:45,748 --> 01:07:51,637
MATT: Five points of damage. All right, so it hits
him, and he gives this guttural loss of air sound,

1015
01:07:51,637 --> 01:07:53,681
but it's still standing without an issue.

1016
01:07:53,681 --> 01:07:56,439
SAM: Is that a part of the flurry of blows attack,
or is that when I bonus attack?

1017
01:07:56,439 --> 01:08:00,836
MATT: Well, the flurry of blows becomes your
bonus. You do two attacks instead of one with your

1018
01:08:00,836 --> 01:08:02,271
bonus is what flurry does.

1019
01:08:02,271 --> 01:08:06,980
SAM: Okay. So if I hit someone with a flurry of
blows, he must succeed on a dexterity saving throw

1020
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:08,505
or be knocked prone.

1021
01:08:08,505 --> 01:08:15,493
MATT: Oh shit. With an eight, no, he does not. So
the one you slam, while it doesn't kill him, it

1022
01:08:15,493 --> 01:08:20,249
knocks him off his feet, and it falls to the
ground. It's clawing to find purchase to get

1023
01:08:20,249 --> 01:08:21,851
itself back to its feet.

1024
01:08:21,851 --> 01:08:29,716
SAM: All right, Forcs. Appetizer course is over. I
don't know how far I can take this metaphor!

1025
01:08:29,716 --> 01:08:32,695
(laughter)

1026
01:08:32,695 --> 01:08:35,240
DARIN: All the way till dessert, is what I think!

1027
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:39,201
SAM: Salad course!

1028
01:08:39,201 --> 01:08:46,819
MATT: With that, the remaining five... or the four
that aren't currently prone, rush up-- the one

1029
01:08:46,819 --> 01:08:50,730
that was prone gets up with its turn and it's
going to go ahead and strike at you. It can't move

1030
01:08:50,783 --> 01:08:55,823
anywhere, because it's no longer prone.
Something's going to strike at you-- okay, that's

1031
01:08:55,823 --> 01:08:58,141
a 23 to hit?

1032
01:08:58,141 --> 01:08:59,190
SAM: Yes.

1033
01:08:59,190 --> 01:09:05,563
MATT: You take seven points of slashing damage
from its bite attack-- sorry, it's from the

1034
01:09:05,563 --> 01:09:09,831
scratch attack as it strikes across you with its
claw. It rolled max damage. It's going to attempt

1035
01:09:09,831 --> 01:09:15,031
to bite at you. That's a nine, which does not hit
you. So it strikes you with its claw, then goes to

1036
01:09:15,031 --> 01:09:22,735
bite you and its jaw hits your armored flesh,
your hide, and can't seem to pierce it. Another one

1037
01:09:22,735 --> 01:09:28,347
rushes to the side to try and gang up on you. It tries
to climb onto your back. That is a 16 to hit.

1038
01:09:28,347 --> 01:09:29,476
What's your armor class?

1039
01:09:29,476 --> 01:09:30,383
SAM: 17.

1040
01:09:30,383 --> 01:09:34,993
MATT: 17! It jumps onto your back but it can't
pierce your hard hide, while another one-- a third

1041
01:09:34,993 --> 01:09:40,375
one is going to rush up behind you as well. That
one is going to be a 21 to hit.

1042
01:09:40,375 --> 01:09:41,485
SAM: Yes.

1043
01:09:41,485 --> 01:09:46,549
MATT: And that one takes-- you take three points
of slashing damage as it rakes into your back and

1044
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:50,726
it gets up onto your shoulders. It's going to
attempt to bite down on the top of your head. With

1045
01:09:50,726 --> 01:09:57,336
a ten. As it bites down once again, it just can't
seem to bite through your thick olog hide. Those

1046
01:09:57,336 --> 01:10:03,761
are the three ghouls that are on you. Two more
emerge from the mound and began rushing in.

1047
01:10:03,761 --> 01:10:09,495
However, they cannot get into combat right now and
still attack. The-- let's see, there's two more.

1048
01:10:09,495 --> 01:10:14,066
One of them is going to rush towards you, Mozuu, and one's
going to rush around trying to look--

1049
01:10:14,066 --> 01:10:15,513
LAURA: (sings)

1050
01:10:15,597 --> 01:10:17,993
MATT: Oh, that would've been amazing.

1051
01:10:17,993 --> 01:10:19,664
TRAVIS: No more eagles.

1052
01:10:19,664 --> 01:10:27,044
MATT: (laughs) Good! That works to your favor.
Actually, no, that's going to be two on Mozuu.

1053
01:10:27,114 --> 01:10:30,404
Because they don't know where you are and they're
a little scared of you at the moment. All right,

1054
01:10:30,437 --> 01:10:32,070
that's going to be a 21?

1055
01:10:32,111 --> 01:10:33,969
DARIN: 21 points of damage?

1056
01:10:33,969 --> 01:10:36,656
MATT: No, 21 to hit. What's your armor class?

1057
01:10:36,656 --> 01:10:38,336
DARIN: Yeah, it hits. Because I'm an 18.

1058
01:10:38,336 --> 01:10:42,940
MATT: All right. So you take two points of slashing
damage from the scratch, and 18?

1059
01:10:43,027 --> 01:10:44,300
DARIN: Yeah.

1060
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:50,892
MATT: You take three points of piercing damage from
the bite. The other one that swung up to you,

1061
01:10:50,892 --> 01:11:01,751
because this one is now currently flanking you
with the other one, that is a 23 to hit, which I

1062
01:11:01,751 --> 01:11:05,804
believe hits. And then 24 to hit. 18 and 19.

1063
01:11:05,804 --> 01:11:08,277
SAM: Mozuu! They have chosen you!

1064
01:11:08,277 --> 01:11:09,418
TRAVIS: Yeah! (laughs)

1065
01:11:09,418 --> 01:11:10,648
DARIN: It's part of my name.

1066
01:11:10,648 --> 01:11:15,669
MATT: That's seven points of slashing damage plus
an additional 1d4. So you get an additional one,

1067
01:11:15,697 --> 01:11:20,754
so it's eight points of slashing damage. And
second strike is going to be-- damage-wise,

1068
01:11:20,754 --> 01:11:26,486
(counting) ooh, nine points of piercing damage.

1069
01:11:26,486 --> 01:11:29,024
TRAVIS: Ding!

1070
01:11:29,102 --> 01:11:30,775
LAURA: How are you at? What's your health at?

1071
01:11:30,775 --> 01:11:35,353
MATT: They're ganging up on you. You get the
sense, individually they are not very dangerous,

1072
01:11:35,353 --> 01:11:40,225
necessarily. They go down pretty quick. But when
they gang up, it's bad, and they're ganging up on

1073
01:11:40,225 --> 01:11:41,519
Mozuu right now.

1074
01:11:41,519 --> 01:11:43,225
TRAVIS: I've heard this before about ghouls.

1075
01:11:43,225 --> 01:11:46,336
MATT: So ending that turn. Arby, you're up.

1076
01:11:46,336 --> 01:11:50,364
LAURA: I'm going to-- you said they're susceptible
to bright light?

1077
01:11:50,364 --> 01:11:51,375
TRAVIS: Bright light!

1078
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:57,224
LAURA: All right. I'm going to pull out my torch
and I'm going to hold it in the same hand with my

1079
01:11:57,224 --> 01:12:00,000
maul, because I got big hands. And then I'm going
to swing it.

1080
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,062
MATT: Okay. I'm going to say it takes an action
for you to light the torch--

1081
01:12:03,062 --> 01:12:08,439
LAURA: Oh, I have to light? No, I didn't light it.
As a bonus action, I took it out but I didn't

1082
01:12:08,439 --> 01:12:09,574
light it.

1083
01:12:09,574 --> 01:12:11,134
MATT: Okay, so you're just holding it? Okay.

1084
01:12:11,134 --> 01:12:12,482
SAM: Hoping that'll be enough light?

1085
01:12:12,544 --> 01:12:17,870
LAURA: Yeah. And then I'm going to try to hit the
ones that were attacking Mozuu.

1086
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:24,060
MATT: So you lumber up with an unlit torch,
clasped in your hand with your maul, and you're

1087
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:26,485
going to attack the ones against Mozuu. All right.
Roll for the first attack.

1088
01:12:26,485 --> 01:12:27,971
LAURA: (laughs) Okay.

1089
01:12:27,971 --> 01:12:31,171
SAM: It must cast some light.

1090
01:12:31,171 --> 01:12:35,062
LAURA: Yeah! I mean, that's what torches do.

1091
01:12:35,062 --> 01:12:36,771
(laughter)

1092
01:12:36,771 --> 01:12:40,900
LAURA: Twenty-- I suck at this particular number
combination. 21.

1093
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:42,980
MATT: 21 hits. Yeah, go and roll damage.

1094
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:44,770
SAM: It's a 20 and a one.

1095
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:46,534
LAURA: Yeah.

1096
01:12:46,534 --> 01:12:47,999
DARIN: Apparently it's forever.

1097
01:12:47,999 --> 01:12:50,005
LAURA: Ooh, that's good. That's 15.

1098
01:12:50,005 --> 01:12:51,672
MATT: 15 points of damage?

1099
01:12:51,672 --> 01:12:52,561
LAURA: Yeah.

1100
01:12:52,561 --> 01:12:56,257
MATT: With one strike, you splatter this ghoul
across the mound. You see its arms and legs go

1101
01:12:56,257 --> 01:12:59,529
flying apart as its torso is crushed and
destroyed. It's in pieces.

1102
01:12:59,529 --> 01:13:01,099
LAURA: I'm going to attack another one.

1103
01:13:01,099 --> 01:13:03,731
SAM: Does the torso light the torch?

1104
01:13:03,731 --> 01:13:08,902
MATT: Nope. (laughs) It's important to know.

1105
01:13:08,902 --> 01:13:10,201
LAURA: 11.

1106
01:13:10,201 --> 01:13:11,223
MATT: 11 just hits.

1107
01:13:11,223 --> 01:13:18,497
LAURA: Yeah! Oh, I get to reroll that. Yes! 14.

1108
01:13:18,497 --> 01:13:23,178
MATT: 14 points of damage. You splatter a second
one. You come swinging, and with each hit, the one

1109
01:13:23,178 --> 01:13:27,735
to the left and the one to the right of Mozuu are
both turned to absolute unliving matter.

1110
01:13:27,735 --> 01:13:32,026
LAURA: So there's two more of them on Mozuu? There's
two more on Mozuu?

1111
01:13:32,026 --> 01:13:38,117
MATT: No, the two that are on Mozuu are gone.
There's three that are now climbing up on Eden

1112
01:13:38,117 --> 01:13:40,252
that have been trying to strike through.

1113
01:13:40,252 --> 01:13:44,934
LAURA: I'm going to turn. I'm going to use my
action surge to hit two more to try to hit them.

1114
01:13:44,934 --> 01:13:47,152
MATT: All right. So you use the last bit of your
movement. This will be the end of your

1115
01:13:47,152 --> 01:13:49,600
movement to get to Eden, but you can attack two
that are on him.

1116
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,374
LAURA: That's 14.

1117
01:13:52,374 --> 01:13:53,684
MATT: 14 hits.

1118
01:13:53,684 --> 01:14:02,688
LAURA: I've got to keep that eight. Five is...
eight plus five is 12-- 13? No.

1119
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:06,234
MATT: Eight plus five is 13. That's correct.

1120
01:14:06,234 --> 01:14:07,551
LAURA: 13.

1121
01:14:07,551 --> 01:14:15,988
MATT: You actually slam the maul into the side of
Eden. Eden, you take just a simple three points of

1122
01:14:15,988 --> 01:14:22,504
bludgeoning damage, but the ghoul that was
currently clasped onto your side is smeared

1123
01:14:22,551 --> 01:14:24,793
against you. There is a spray of dark crimson.

1124
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:31,177
LAURA: I've got one more attack here. Ooh, that's
good. That definitely hits. 24.

1125
01:14:31,177 --> 01:14:32,933
MATT: Yeah. Roll damage.

1126
01:14:32,933 --> 01:14:35,401
LAURA: Ooh! 15!

1127
01:14:35,401 --> 01:14:40,834
MATT: 15. And with that, you splattered the one on
the other side, the back shoulder portion of Eden,

1128
01:14:40,834 --> 01:14:47,815
and this time, you don't slam it <i>into</i> Eden, you
just swing wide and you baseball-bat slam

1129
01:14:47,815 --> 01:14:52,474
it, sending it flying 30, 40 feet arcing through
the sky. (ghoul screaming) There's still the one

1130
01:14:52,474 --> 01:14:54,625
of top of his shoulders. You got four in one
round!

1131
01:14:54,625 --> 01:14:57,420
LAURA: Yeah. <i>You're welcome.</i>

1132
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:59,418
SAM: I don't know what that means.

1133
01:14:59,418 --> 01:15:01,142
MATT: While this is happening, Mozuu, it's your
turn.

1134
01:15:01,142 --> 01:15:02,794
DARIN: There are two in the distance?

1135
01:15:02,794 --> 01:15:08,824
MATT: There are two more. There's one that got up
on the ground that's in front of Eden, there's

1136
01:15:08,824 --> 01:15:13,535
one that's rushing in, and there's one that's on
top of Eden's shoulders right now.

1137
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:18,845
DARIN: I'll go for the one that's on top of Eden's
shoulders. I want to pull him off and bite, and

1138
01:15:18,845 --> 01:15:20,644
try and rip his throat out?

1139
01:15:20,644 --> 01:15:23,842
MATT: Okay.

1140
01:15:23,842 --> 01:15:27,867
TRAVIS: Wow. Said so casually! "I would like to
bite and--"

1141
01:15:27,867 --> 01:15:36,407
MATT: As you rush up to the side to grab it, make
a grapple check. Roll an athletics check.

1142
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:42,712
DARIN: Okay. Oh! 12.

1143
01:15:42,712 --> 01:15:49,555
MATT: The ghoul rolled a natural one. Without an
issue, you peel the ghoul off its back. Do you

1144
01:15:49,555 --> 01:15:54,788
want to lunge for its throat? All right, roll an
attack.

1145
01:15:54,788 --> 01:15:59,129
DARIN: 12 plus my strength?

1146
01:15:59,129 --> 01:16:00,585
MATT: Plus your strength, yeah.

1147
01:16:00,585 --> 01:16:01,671
DARIN: 15.

1148
01:16:01,671 --> 01:16:05,872
MATT: 15. Okay. Roll a 1d4 and add your strength
modifier and damage to it.

1149
01:16:05,872 --> 01:16:14,517
DARIN: That would be 16, my modifier? Three! So
six.

1150
01:16:14,517 --> 01:16:20,612
MATT: Six points of damage. So as you pull the
ghoul off, it's screeching. You grab it by the

1151
01:16:20,612 --> 01:16:25,169
back of the head, pull it back, sink your teeth
into its throat and tear a chunk out. It's not a

1152
01:16:25,169 --> 01:16:28,979
mortal wound, but now it's missing part of its
throat, and its screeching goes from a (screech)

1153
01:16:28,979 --> 01:16:32,849
to (moan) this horrible sucking sound as part of
its trachea is now exposed.

1154
01:16:32,849 --> 01:16:36,932
DARIN: I get another attack. It says, "you can
make two attacks."

1155
01:16:36,932 --> 01:16:38,208
MATT: Oh, right.

1156
01:16:38,208 --> 01:16:41,970
DARIN: When you make an attack action, you can
make two attacks. I want to attack his throat again.

1157
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:47,103
MATT: Go for it. He has a bonus action. War
cleric.

1158
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:50,609
DARIN: That's a 15. That is an 18.

1159
01:16:50,609 --> 01:16:52,320
MATT: That hits. Roll another d4.

1160
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,988
DARIN: That's another six.

1161
01:16:54,988 --> 01:16:59,353
MATT: As you pull away the first piece of flesh,
you spit it to the side. As this horrible sucking

1162
01:16:59,353 --> 01:17:03,548
screech sound happens, you reach down this time,
getting a larger bite into its throat, and as you

1163
01:17:03,548 --> 01:17:07,839
pull back, you leave nothing but the spine left
behind, and the ghoul goes limp in your grasp, as

1164
01:17:07,839 --> 01:17:10,389
you have the rest of its throat in your maw.

1165
01:17:10,389 --> 01:17:13,849
DARIN: Wow. I've finally lived my dreams.

1166
01:17:13,849 --> 01:17:16,271
(laughter)

1167
01:17:16,271 --> 01:17:19,185
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Mozuu? That
brings it to the top. Skak, you're up.

1168
01:17:19,185 --> 01:17:24,429
TRAVIS: I jump out from behind where I'm hiding,
and I load my crossbow at the one that's running,

1169
01:17:24,429 --> 01:17:26,129
and I pull the trigger.

1170
01:17:26,129 --> 01:17:29,998
MATT: Go for it. You have advantage because it
does not see you.

1171
01:17:29,998 --> 01:17:33,280
TRAVIS: Oh! 21.

1172
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,119
MATT: 21? All right, roll for damage.

1173
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:42,431
TRAVIS: 12, right? No sneak attack?

1174
01:17:42,431 --> 01:17:44,691
MATT: No, sneak attack, because it didn't see you.
You were hidden.

1175
01:17:44,691 --> 01:17:51,070
TRAVIS: Right. Oh, it is sneak attack? (counting)
21.

1176
01:17:51,070 --> 01:17:52,390
LAURA: Holy moly.

1177
01:17:52,390 --> 01:18:00,561
MATT: As it's rushing, we're talking 28 Days Later
sprinting zombie level. Falls limp, unmoving, onto

1178
01:18:00,561 --> 01:18:03,560
the mound. The bolt went through its throat and
chest area.

1179
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:06,635
TRAVIS: (pants) Forcs!

1180
01:18:06,635 --> 01:18:09,320
(laughter)

1181
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,390
TRAVIS: Forcs!

1182
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:16,828
MATT: You watch as three more begin to emerge from
the sides of the mound. This looks to be

1183
01:18:16,828 --> 01:18:22,771
essentially a hive home to these, and you have no
idea how many are inside. Three more emerge.

1184
01:18:22,771 --> 01:18:26,900
Eden, you're up.

1185
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:32,951
SAM: Maybe we should go? Seems like they keep
coming. Maybe we should run?

1186
01:18:32,951 --> 01:18:38,200
TRAVIS: Yes, I remember they have a weakness to
bright light, and they live in hives. We should go!

1187
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,675
LAURA: Don't worry, I have a torch.

1188
01:18:39,675 --> 01:18:42,899
TRAVIS: Don't light it! I think it's an unlit
torch.

1189
01:18:42,899 --> 01:18:44,670
LAURA: Well, you said it was susceptible--

1190
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:49,327
TRAVIS: Don't hurt yourself. It's okay. We should
go! Mozuu?

1191
01:18:49,327 --> 01:18:51,180
SAM: Mozuu, do we have your blessing to flee?

1192
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:53,565
DARIN: Look, a lot happened just now.

1193
01:18:53,565 --> 01:18:55,730
TRAVIS: What's on your face?

1194
01:18:55,730 --> 01:19:03,237
DARIN: It's my face. It's called fear, and a
leader can't show fear. I'm not leader anymore.

1195
01:19:03,237 --> 01:19:05,119
You're leader.

1196
01:19:05,119 --> 01:19:10,091
SAM: I'm leader. You hear that? Bow before me!

1197
01:19:10,091 --> 01:19:17,818
DARIN: I bow before him. You gave me eyes, and yet
I didn't see. I didn't see this hive, and I almost

1198
01:19:17,818 --> 01:19:21,561
died. I'm not leader. I'm not fit to lead the
Forcs.

1199
01:19:21,561 --> 01:19:23,270
LAURA: All right.

1200
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:25,240
DARIN: You're leader, as well.

1201
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,616
LAURA: All right.

1202
01:19:26,616 --> 01:19:30,310
DARIN: You're leader, too. I follow all three of
you.

1203
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:32,134
TRAVIS: You can't have two leaders.

1204
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:40,930
DARIN: There's two things I know: the Forcs have
three leaders and one follower. There's three

1205
01:19:40,930 --> 01:19:45,810
things I know: that follower is me, and that's
it.

1206
01:19:45,810 --> 01:19:49,480
MATT: Eden, while this is happening, it's your
turn, and you've been bowing to him.

1207
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:53,171
SAM: He's been bowing to me. I'm going to run.

1208
01:19:53,171 --> 01:19:55,461
MATT: Okay. You still have one on your shoulders,
by the way.

1209
01:19:55,461 --> 01:19:56,440
SAM: Oh.

1210
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:59,010
DARIN: A lovely speech.

1211
01:19:59,010 --> 01:20:01,478
MATT: As it's trying to claw and bite you.

1212
01:20:01,478 --> 01:20:07,178
TRAVIS: Delineating responsibility.

1213
01:20:07,178 --> 01:20:18,211
SAM: I'm going to run and hope he falls off, like
a big bucking bronco. I'll use my step of the wind

1214
01:20:18,248 --> 01:20:21,752
to go faster and jump really far.

1215
01:20:21,752 --> 01:20:27,926
MATT: Okay, you full run, dash action, and use
that to move another movement. You watch as this

1216
01:20:27,926 --> 01:20:36,890
giant olog-hai, like Wile E. Coyote, leaves behind
a cloud in his shape behind. Because you're moving

1217
01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:43,071
that fast, I will make sure the ghoul has to make
a save to stay on. With a natural two for a

1218
01:20:43,071 --> 01:20:48,321
strength save, no. The ghoul stumbles off,
tumbling onto the ground behind you. Gets back up

1219
01:20:48,321 --> 01:20:54,469
onto its feet. You start bolting in an eastern
direction. Ending your turn, it's now the ghouls'

1220
01:20:54,469 --> 01:20:58,722
turn. They cannot catch up to you. The one that
gets up tries to run after you, but it's slowly

1221
01:20:58,722 --> 01:21:03,612
behind. The other three now begin to emerge, and
they're now rushing up towards you, seeing that

1222
01:21:03,612 --> 01:21:09,313
you smashed so many of them in the past rounds.
Three of them. Six attacks on you. They rush in.

1223
01:21:09,313 --> 01:21:17,665
The first one's going to go for a scratch and bite.
12? And a seven.

1224
01:21:17,665 --> 01:21:19,111
TRAVIS: Wow!

1225
01:21:19,111 --> 01:21:25,863
MATT: Second one up behind you. That is 18? All
right, with that, because they're ganged up on

1226
01:21:25,863 --> 01:21:30,681
you, they do more damage. That is six points of
slashing damage.

1227
01:21:30,681 --> 01:21:32,163
SAM: Are we leaving?

1228
01:21:32,163 --> 01:21:34,271
DARIN: You're leaving.

1229
01:21:34,271 --> 01:21:35,723
SAM: I thought that was the plan!

1230
01:21:35,723 --> 01:21:37,301
MATT: It's their turn now, and then they get to
go.

1231
01:21:37,301 --> 01:21:38,854
DARIN: Bye!

1232
01:21:38,854 --> 01:21:41,195
MATT: That's a 21.

1233
01:21:41,195 --> 01:21:43,153
DARIN: A leader leaves.

1234
01:21:43,153 --> 01:21:49,272
MATT: You take five points of piercing damage as
this one claws and bites into you, and then that

1235
01:21:49,272 --> 01:21:59,303
is a 17? No. And a nine. So they're clawing and
jumping onto you. They're scraping at the armor, but

1236
01:21:59,303 --> 01:22:03,612
it's keeping most of them at bay. They get a few
hits, but it's not too bad. That ends their turn.

1237
01:22:03,612 --> 01:22:05,943
That brings us to you, Arby. What are you going to
do?

1238
01:22:05,943 --> 01:22:08,853
LAURA: I guess I'm going to try to kill these
things that were attacking me.

1239
01:22:08,853 --> 01:22:12,343
MATT: Okay. You've got three of them on you
right now. They're climbing all over you.

1240
01:22:12,343 --> 01:22:16,589
LAURA: Ooh! I thought that was really good, but it
wasn't. It's 18.

1241
01:22:16,589 --> 01:22:18,062
MATT: 18 still hits. Roll damage.

1242
01:22:18,062 --> 01:22:27,176
LAURA: (cackles) 16!

1243
01:22:27,176 --> 01:22:34,723
MATT: 16. There's one to the side. You grab it by
the head and smash it in your grip and throw it to

1244
01:22:34,723 --> 01:22:38,004
the ground with a slopping sound. Your next
attack?

1245
01:22:38,004 --> 01:22:43,632
LAURA: I'm going to look down and try to hit the
one that's at my feet. That's a natural one.

1246
01:22:43,632 --> 01:22:47,994
MATT: You try to reach for him, but he's just out
of reach, so you start spinning to try to get a

1247
01:22:47,994 --> 01:22:51,884
better reach, but he's attached to you, so he
spins, too. You end up going in circles for the

1248
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:53,983
rest of your round, chasing your tail.

1249
01:22:53,983 --> 01:22:59,453
LAURA: Eden! I thought I was supposed to run, but
I can't run!

1250
01:22:59,453 --> 01:23:00,743
SAM: Why?

1251
01:23:00,743 --> 01:23:02,473
LAURA: There's ghouls!

1252
01:23:02,473 --> 01:23:04,474
MATT: Mozuu, you're up.

1253
01:23:04,474 --> 01:23:08,880
DARIN: It worked once. I'm going to grab him and
try to rip his throat out.

1254
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:16,383
MATT: Okay. Now you have a taste of ghoul in your
mouth. You rush over to Arburuk. Make a grapple check.

1255
01:23:16,383 --> 01:23:18,903
DARIN: Grapple is plus what?

1256
01:23:18,903 --> 01:23:20,586
MATT: It's an athletics check.

1257
01:23:20,586 --> 01:23:24,262
DARIN: Oh, great. 20.

1258
01:23:24,262 --> 01:23:31,331
MATT: 20? All right. Rolled a 19, actually. 18
plus one for its strength. It's not enough, so you

1259
01:23:31,331 --> 01:23:36,604
manage to grab and pull it and barely peel it off,
and you're going to try to go for its throat

1260
01:23:36,604 --> 01:23:37,992
again? Roll an attack.

1261
01:23:37,992 --> 01:23:44,235
DARIN: 18 plus three. That is a 21.

1262
01:23:44,235 --> 01:23:47,526
MATT: That hits. Roll damage. 1d4 plus your
strength.

1263
01:23:47,526 --> 01:23:51,273
DARIN: Three plus three. That is a six. We are
repeating again.

1264
01:23:51,273 --> 01:23:53,197
MATT: All right, roll one more time.

1265
01:23:53,197 --> 01:23:59,675
DARIN: Seven. So that's ten, so that did not.

1266
01:23:59,675 --> 01:24:05,644
MATT: Ten does not, unfortunately. You bite one
chunk out of the middle of its clavicle area, and

1267
01:24:05,644 --> 01:24:10,222
it's scrambling against you and pushing against
your face. As you go for the secondary bite, it

1268
01:24:10,222 --> 01:24:15,300
jams its hand into your mouth, and you gag
for a minute and have to pull it out. It manages

1269
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:19,779
to stave off the fight for the moment, at least.
That ends your turn, Mozuu? Skak, you're up.

1270
01:24:19,779 --> 01:24:22,369
TRAVIS: How many are left? Two? Three?

1271
01:24:22,369 --> 01:24:27,097
MATT: There are three. There's one that's still
stuck to Arby, there's one that's being held by

1272
01:24:27,097 --> 01:24:30,493
Mozuu, and there's one that fell off the shoulders
of Eden as he ran away.

1273
01:24:30,493 --> 01:24:33,072
TRAVIS: Are any of them within 15 feet of me?

1274
01:24:33,072 --> 01:24:37,145
MATT: From where you were, you're not that far
from Arby and Mozuu. You could probably move in

1275
01:24:37,145 --> 01:24:38,382
pretty close, yeah.

1276
01:24:38,382 --> 01:24:40,512
TRAVIS: I want to try and cast Thunderwave.

1277
01:24:40,512 --> 01:24:43,449
MATT: Thunderwave? Okay.

1278
01:24:43,449 --> 01:24:48,031
TRAVIS: It's going to hit you guys, isn't it? It
hits everybody.

1279
01:24:48,031 --> 01:24:53,643
MATT: You can aim it in a way that will hit both
of them, but you'll hit hit either one or the other.

1280
01:24:53,643 --> 01:24:56,380
TRAVIS: I definitely want to try to hit as many of
you as possible.

1281
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:59,372
(laughter)

1282
01:24:59,372 --> 01:25:04,352
MATT: You could hit all of them, all four. You
won't hit Eden, because he's too far away, but you

1283
01:25:04,352 --> 01:25:05,603
can hit all four of them.

1284
01:25:05,603 --> 01:25:09,035
SAM: (shouting) Guys, are you coming or what?
Guys?

1285
01:25:09,035 --> 01:25:12,123
MATT: Perfect.

1286
01:25:12,123 --> 01:25:16,763
TRAVIS: May the dark lord grant me a Thunderwave?

1287
01:25:16,763 --> 01:25:25,002
MATT: What you do is reach into your pouch and
find one of those explosives that you had earlier,

1288
01:25:25,002 --> 01:25:36,292
and you throw it and clench backward. I need both
Mozuu and Arby to roll a constitution saving

1289
01:25:36,292 --> 01:25:40,872
throw. I'm going to do the same. What's your spell
save DC?

1290
01:25:40,872 --> 01:25:42,074
TRAVIS: 14.

1291
01:25:42,074 --> 01:25:46,123
MATT: They both fail. You rolled a ten? Fail.

1292
01:25:46,123 --> 01:25:47,787
LAURA: 13.

1293
01:25:47,787 --> 01:25:52,493
MATT: Fail. All of you take 2d8 thunder damage,
and you're pushed ten feet away. Roll, Travis.

1294
01:25:52,493 --> 01:25:53,757
Roll 2d8.

1295
01:25:53,757 --> 01:25:57,482
TRAVIS: 13.

1296
01:25:57,482 --> 01:26:02,184
LAURA: You asshole. I mean, you glob!

1297
01:26:02,184 --> 01:26:07,994
MATT: Both of you guys take 13 points of thunder
damage and are blown ten feet back as this small

1298
01:26:07,994 --> 01:26:15,633
rolling ball explodes in a concussive blast. Both
of the ghouls get scattered into nothing. The

1299
01:26:15,633 --> 01:26:21,093
sound of the explosion echoes throughout the
mountains, and both of you guys get pushed back

1300
01:26:21,129 --> 01:26:22,752
ten feet, almost landing on the ground.

1301
01:26:22,796 --> 01:26:26,624
TRAVIS: Can I bonus action my nimble escape? To
hide?

1302
01:26:26,624 --> 01:26:28,413
MATT: Make a stealth check.

1303
01:26:28,413 --> 01:26:38,131
TRAVIS: 15. No, 23. Stealth is plus ten! I'm used
to the other. 23.

1304
01:26:38,131 --> 01:26:42,186
MATT: All right, so as the explosion happens and you're
standing right where the ball rolled, you're like,

1305
01:26:42,186 --> 01:26:46,585
"shit!" Move back behind the mound and try to
stealth and hide. Okay, that ends your turn. Both

1306
01:26:46,585 --> 01:26:52,046
of them are detonated, at this point. There is the
one across the way that fell off that's trying to

1307
01:26:52,046 --> 01:26:57,249
catch up to Eden but is too slow. There's none
currently out in the open, but you can hear sounds

1308
01:26:57,249 --> 01:26:59,125
of scratching and little voices.

1309
01:26:59,125 --> 01:27:02,556
LAURA: I can't really hear anything after that
explosion.

1310
01:27:02,556 --> 01:27:05,676
MATT: That's true. The two of you, your bell's a
little rung. You hear this, as you're hiding up

1311
01:27:05,676 --> 01:27:07,166
against the mound right now.

1312
01:27:07,166 --> 01:27:10,696
TRAVIS: How many of those explosive orbs did I
use? All of them, or just two?

1313
01:27:10,696 --> 01:27:14,177
MATT: We'll say, for as many spell slots as you
have.

1314
01:27:14,177 --> 01:27:15,337
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

1315
01:27:15,337 --> 01:27:20,286
MATT: All right, so that brings us to Eden.

1316
01:27:20,286 --> 01:27:26,838
SAM: I'm 80 feet away, and my darkvision can't see
that far, so all I heard was an explosion in the

1317
01:27:26,838 --> 01:27:38,708
dark, so I drop to my knee, and I say: As the only
surviving member of the Forcs, I will say a word

1318
01:27:38,708 --> 01:27:47,004
to thank the great dark lord for choosing me to
carry on the mantle of this mission. And I will

1319
01:27:47,004 --> 01:27:49,391
keep running as fast as I can away.

1320
01:27:49,391 --> 01:27:56,535
MATT: Okay. You bolt away. This poor little ghoul
has no sight of you. As that ends your turn, it is

1321
01:27:56,535 --> 01:28:02,266
now the ghoul's turn. It's like, (panting). It's
lost and doesn't see you. It's going to make a

1322
01:28:02,266 --> 01:28:07,278
perception check. Nope! It begins scrambling its
way back toward the mound.

1323
01:28:07,278 --> 01:28:09,207
LAURA: Does it know where home is?

1324
01:28:09,207 --> 01:28:12,637
MATT: We'll find out. The rest of this story is
the saddest little ghoul.

1325
01:28:12,637 --> 01:28:15,726
SAM: It's like Benji.

1326
01:28:15,726 --> 01:28:19,715
MATT: Three more ghouls emerge from the inside of
the mound.

1327
01:28:19,715 --> 01:28:27,833
DARIN: We can take it. Earth ghouls are easy.
Thank you! Sorry.

1328
01:28:27,833 --> 01:28:29,611
TRAVIS: Some of them are apparently explosive.

1329
01:28:29,611 --> 01:28:30,644
DARIN: What?

1330
01:28:30,644 --> 01:28:32,059
TRAVIS: Explosive!

1331
01:28:32,059 --> 01:28:37,018
MATT: They emerge, but they are not in combat yet.
Arby, you're up.

1332
01:28:37,018 --> 01:28:41,542
LAURA: I think we should run away! And I start
running away.

1333
01:28:41,542 --> 01:28:42,686
MATT: Okay.

1334
01:28:42,686 --> 01:28:44,947
LAURA: As I'm running, do I see the little lost
ghoul?

1335
01:28:44,947 --> 01:28:50,290
MATT: I'll say yes. I'll say as you're running
away, it's coming back towards you.

1336
01:28:50,290 --> 01:28:54,011
LAURA: I splat it. I want to try to splat it as
I'm running.

1337
01:28:54,011 --> 01:28:55,742
TRAVIS: I totally heard law school.

1338
01:28:55,742 --> 01:28:59,018
DARIN: I passed the bar.

1339
01:28:59,018 --> 01:29:01,216
LAURA: 26!

1340
01:29:01,216 --> 01:29:02,835
MATT: 26 hits. Roll damage.

1341
01:29:02,835 --> 01:29:08,367
LAURA: 14.

1342
01:29:08,367 --> 01:29:14,222
MATT: All right, so this one ghoul who had made
his journey back finally sees home and is running

1343
01:29:14,222 --> 01:29:24,789
up and sees you (heavy footsteps, impact) and
full-on whack-a-mole him into the dirt.

1344
01:29:24,789 --> 01:29:26,535
LAURA: I keep running.

1345
01:29:26,535 --> 01:29:27,879
MATT: You keep running.

1346
01:29:27,879 --> 01:29:34,462
LAURA: Can I use-- as my bonus action, I'm going
to use my second wind.

1347
01:29:34,462 --> 01:29:40,351
MATT: Go for it. You get to heal up some damage.
All right. Mozuu.

1348
01:29:40,351 --> 01:29:52,027
DARIN: Question: I started, hit-point-wise, at 44.
I'm now at nine. I can perform Lay on Hands and

1349
01:29:52,027 --> 01:29:54,845
heal myself. Does that take time?

1350
01:29:54,845 --> 01:29:56,208
MATT: It's an action.

1351
01:29:56,208 --> 01:30:01,069
DARIN: Yeah. If it's my turn, I'm going to do
that.

1352
01:30:01,069 --> 01:30:07,660
MATT: Okay. You can use as many points as you want
to heal yourself.

1353
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:14,396
DARIN: So if I spend nine hit points to heal as
many as I can?

1354
01:30:14,396 --> 01:30:19,931
MATT: You have a pool of 25 hit points total, and
you choose a number of that 25. You only have 25

1355
01:30:19,931 --> 01:30:23,089
for the whole day that you can heal with that, but
you can do five or ten or eight.

1356
01:30:23,089 --> 01:30:24,663
DARIN: I'd like to try for ten.

1357
01:30:24,663 --> 01:30:29,728
MATT: Okay, so you use your action to heal ten hit
points. Mark those ten off, and you heal ten.

1358
01:30:29,728 --> 01:30:35,712
DARIN: Great. I'm at 19, minus ten, and then I
will run.

1359
01:30:35,712 --> 01:30:39,759
MATT: Okay. You go running and bolting off. Okay,
so as you guys are all charging, you're still

1360
01:30:39,759 --> 01:30:43,619
hidden against the mound. You see these three
emerge from the side, and they're between you and

1361
01:30:43,619 --> 01:30:45,661
your allies as you're pressed against the mound.

1362
01:30:45,661 --> 01:30:49,281
TRAVIS: (screams) I take off running, too.

1363
01:30:49,281 --> 01:30:53,459
MATT: You go running past one of them. It does get
an attack of opportunity on you as you emerge.

1364
01:30:53,459 --> 01:30:56,580
That's going to hit. That's a 17 plus five.

1365
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:58,478
TRAVIS: Uncanny dodge!

1366
01:30:58,478 --> 01:31:05,737
MATT: Okay, so that's five points of slashing
damage, which you take half of, so that's two. But

1367
01:31:05,737 --> 01:31:13,112
you go running past? Double charge? Okay. As you
guys are running, they're pretty quick, and

1368
01:31:13,112 --> 01:31:18,020
they're keeping pace with you. They can't quite
catch up to you, but they're following. As you're

1369
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:21,070
rushing, since you're the furthest behind, make a
perception check.

1370
01:31:21,070 --> 01:31:25,080
TRAVIS: 11.

1371
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:29,179
MATT: Okay. After a while, you eventually hear the
sound subside, and it seems like they're returning

1372
01:31:29,179 --> 01:31:31,951
to their mound. They don't want to get too far
away from their home base.

1373
01:31:31,951 --> 01:31:35,310
LAURA: They don't want to get lost like some other
little ghouls out there.

1374
01:31:35,310 --> 01:31:43,680
TRAVIS: (wheezes) I think they left us behind. Why
do I sound like this?

1375
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:46,977
DARIN: They get you in the throat, did they?

1376
01:31:46,977 --> 01:31:48,660
TRAVIS: Yeah. We're clear!

1377
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:53,863
DARIN: Sorry. Thought you were an imposter.

1378
01:31:53,863 --> 01:31:55,569
TRAVIS: Forgot my inhaler.

1379
01:31:55,569 --> 01:32:09,395
MATT: As the three of you reconvene, you make your
way up the path and see one heavy breathing,

1380
01:32:09,395 --> 01:32:11,880
exhausted Eden, alone.

1381
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:21,312
SAM: They fought bravely. They were my friends.
They took care of me.

1382
01:32:21,312 --> 01:32:24,547
DARIN: They're standing behind you.

1383
01:32:24,547 --> 01:32:27,060
SAM: Oh! I'm hearing voices again.

1384
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:29,114
LAURA: It's the dark lord.

1385
01:32:29,114 --> 01:32:31,699
DARIN: Yeah, the dark lord is speaking to you
now.

1386
01:32:31,699 --> 01:32:34,084
LAURA: You should probably pick your nose.

1387
01:32:34,084 --> 01:32:36,319
SAM: Two voices. Oh god.

1388
01:32:36,319 --> 01:32:38,548
TRAVIS: Ur-Eden!

1389
01:32:38,548 --> 01:32:46,701
SAM: Three voices. He speaks in mysterious ways.
Oh, well. I'll end it all right here.

1390
01:32:46,701 --> 01:32:48,731
TRAVIS: Wait!

1391
01:32:48,731 --> 01:32:50,645
DARIN: No, it's us! Turn around.

1392
01:32:50,645 --> 01:32:52,591
SAM: Oh, hi!

1393
01:32:52,591 --> 01:32:56,570
DARIN: Olog-hai, right back at you.

1394
01:32:56,570 --> 01:32:58,440
TRAVIS: You're faster than I thought.

1395
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,202
SAM: Hi. How'd it go?

1396
01:33:00,202 --> 01:33:07,529
LAURA: We killed them. All of them. Every last one
of them.

1397
01:33:07,529 --> 01:33:08,789
TRAVIS: She killed five of them.

1398
01:33:08,789 --> 01:33:10,311
LAURA: I did. Is that how many I killed?

1399
01:33:10,311 --> 01:33:11,181
TRAVIS: Yep.

1400
01:33:11,181 --> 01:33:13,490
SAM: I'm sorry I left, but when he made me leaver--

1401
01:33:13,490 --> 01:33:16,121
DARIN: Leader.

1402
01:33:16,166 --> 01:33:19,733
SAM: Leader? Oh. I thought he said "leaver."

1403
01:33:19,733 --> 01:33:22,847
TRAVIS: Made me leaver?

1404
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:27,017
SAM: All right, shall we continue eastward?

1405
01:33:27,017 --> 01:33:29,212
LAURA: Okay.

1406
01:33:29,212 --> 01:33:31,710
SAM: Which way is that?

1407
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:33,918
TRAVIS: Do I know which way is east?

1408
01:33:33,918 --> 01:33:38,721
MATT: Make a nature check, since you guys are a
little scattered, at this point.

1409
01:33:38,721 --> 01:33:45,444
TRAVIS: Nature check. Natural 20. That doesn't
help with directions.

1410
01:33:45,444 --> 01:33:49,611
MATT: You do that for a moment and realize that
doesn't help. However, you glance over and see the

1411
01:33:49,611 --> 01:33:52,873
orange glow of the top of Mount Doom, and that
does help you realize: Ah! That is east.

1412
01:33:52,873 --> 01:33:56,292
TRAVIS: That is east.

1413
01:33:56,292 --> 01:34:00,153
MATT: As you begin to move in that direction, I'll
let you-- since you're leading this charge again,

1414
01:34:00,153 --> 01:34:04,222
with the helmet, make a perception check with
advantage because of the nature check. That 20

1415
01:34:04,222 --> 01:34:05,772
gave you a benefit to this.

1416
01:34:05,772 --> 01:34:07,402
TRAVIS: Perception with advantage, or nature with
advantage?

1417
01:34:07,402 --> 01:34:08,801
MATT: Perception with advantage.

1418
01:34:08,801 --> 01:34:12,049
TRAVIS: That helps. 18.

1419
01:34:12,049 --> 01:34:17,331
MATT: 18. You guys have now crested the highest
point of this mountain range and are now making

1420
01:34:17,331 --> 01:34:22,013
your way down the opposite side of this first
ridge. As you climb over the edge, you glance

1421
01:34:22,013 --> 01:34:24,942
over. Are you still on the shoulders of your
olog-hai friend?

1422
01:34:24,942 --> 01:34:26,597
TRAVIS: Yeah, I climb back up.

1423
01:34:26,597 --> 01:34:32,501
MATT: You glance over the shoulders and look down
just past the shelf, and you see this very faint

1424
01:34:32,501 --> 01:34:38,362
bit of light, tucked in this small outcove in the
side of the mountain. You glance past, and you can

1425
01:34:38,362 --> 01:34:47,703
see six uruk figures, five of which are bundled up
in ramshackle rags, small sleeping bag bundles,

1426
01:34:47,703 --> 01:34:54,393
and one of them has a torch across its shoulder,
keeping watch. They look roughly about the size of

1427
01:34:54,393 --> 01:34:57,333
the goblins that you saw fleeing from the
scene.

1428
01:34:57,333 --> 01:35:08,626
TRAVIS: (shushing) I see figures ahead. Three of
them. Three of them! One on guard with a torch.

1429
01:35:08,626 --> 01:35:10,601
LAURA: Do you think we could take them?

1430
01:35:10,601 --> 01:35:13,913
TRAVIS: Yeah, slit their throats while they're
resting.

1431
01:35:13,913 --> 01:35:19,483
LAURA: Wait, but I'm hurt still from the ghouls.
Will you help me?

1432
01:35:19,483 --> 01:35:23,193
(laughter)

1433
01:35:23,193 --> 01:35:28,351
SAM: I'm pretty hurt, too. And you're hurt, as
well. Should we take another rest?

1434
01:35:28,351 --> 01:35:36,273
LAURA: Can we? Can we rest and watch them while we
rest? Let's sit down for 30 minutes, around, and

1435
01:35:36,273 --> 01:35:40,326
maybe heal a little bit, but then be ready to
attack if they get up.

1436
01:35:40,326 --> 01:35:43,433
TRAVIS: No, we charge in!

1437
01:35:43,433 --> 01:35:45,603
LAURA: No, Skak.

1438
01:35:45,603 --> 01:35:49,081
SAM: I can heal us if you want, and we can keep
going.

1439
01:35:49,081 --> 01:35:50,270
LAURA: Yeah.

1440
01:35:50,270 --> 01:35:58,784
SAM: All right, gather around. I will need to use
all of my healing potential for this. What hurts?

1441
01:35:58,784 --> 01:36:05,175
LAURA: Well, my elbow's been giving me some
problems lately, because I think the maul might be

1442
01:36:05,175 --> 01:36:07,642
a little too-- I may be overextending.

1443
01:36:07,642 --> 01:36:10,455
DARIN: I think we're hurt from the fighting that
we just did.

1444
01:36:10,455 --> 01:36:14,472
LAURA: Oh. Well, a ghoul bit me on my knee, and a
ghoul bit my ankle, and another one got up here

1445
01:36:14,472 --> 01:36:18,784
around the shoulder, but I can't tell if it's from
the scar that Skak gave me.

1446
01:36:18,784 --> 01:36:27,318
SAM: I cake some mud onto all of her wounds and
heal her 13 points.

1447
01:36:27,318 --> 01:36:29,571
LAURA: That's good! I was down 15.

1448
01:36:29,571 --> 01:36:35,893
SAM: Well, where do you hurt? What ails you?

1449
01:36:35,893 --> 01:36:46,203
DARIN: Specifically, everything. I will take
whatever you give, O glorious leader. I bow to

1450
01:36:46,203 --> 01:36:47,908
your healing prowess.

1451
01:36:47,908 --> 01:36:50,772
SAM: I will take my hair--

1452
01:36:50,772 --> 01:36:53,206
LAURA: You have hair?

1453
01:36:53,206 --> 01:37:01,516
SAM: Yes, I have a little bit. I shake off the
dandruff, make it into a tea that he drinks, but

1454
01:37:01,516 --> 01:37:06,540
it's filled with protein.

1455
01:37:06,540 --> 01:37:10,485
MATT: Uruk scalp protein?

1456
01:37:10,485 --> 01:37:12,274
SAM: Yeah. That heals 11 points.

1457
01:37:12,274 --> 01:37:22,699
DARIN: That was the best I've ever had in my life.
I may be chosen, but you? You're good.

1458
01:37:22,699 --> 01:37:25,074
TRAVIS: Dandruff scalp protein?

1459
01:37:25,074 --> 01:37:26,387
LAURA: Gross.

1460
01:37:26,387 --> 01:37:33,319
SAM: I keep a little flask of grog. I'll swig
that. Can I heal myself a bit?

1461
01:37:33,319 --> 01:37:34,788
MATT: Yeah.

1462
01:37:34,788 --> 01:37:39,975
SAM: Oh yeah. 11 points. Back up in it.

1463
01:37:39,975 --> 01:37:43,745
LAURA: Can we run to the restroom?

1464
01:37:43,745 --> 01:37:48,435
MATT: I was actually about to say, as you guys are
taking this moment to heal yourselves up and

1465
01:37:48,435 --> 01:37:54,615
prepare yourselves for whatever point of entry to
this apparently unaware group of sleeping uruk

1466
01:37:54,615 --> 01:38:00,516
traitors are, we're going to take a break. We'll
rest up here for a minute. We'll be back here for

1467
01:38:00,516 --> 01:38:06,406
the second half, very soon, of our journey deeper
into the dark depths of Mordor.

1468
01:38:06,406 --> 01:38:07,604
TRAVIS: The Forcs!

1469
01:38:07,604 --> 01:38:10,043
ALL: The Forcs!

1470
01:38:10,043 --> 01:38:14,105
MATT: Thank you again WB Games for this. We'll
come back here with the second half real soon.

1471
01:38:14,105 --> 01:38:17,922
LAURA: This is so much fun!

1472
01:38:17,922 --> 01:38:21,097
MATT: You guys are awesome!

1473
01:38:21,097 --> 01:38:26,875
