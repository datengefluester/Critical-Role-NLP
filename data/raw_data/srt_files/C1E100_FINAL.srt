MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,307 --> 00:00:06,503

Dungeons & Dragons.

3
00:00:06,503 --> 00:00:09,768
(cheering)

4
00:00:09,768 --> 00:00:13,293
MATT: For our special 100th episode, which is

6
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:24,946
MATT: So, you may have noticed, we have a new set.
Our crew's been kicking ass and working hard to

7
00:00:24,946 --> 00:00:30,737

pretty keen on it. so welcome to the visual

glasses, the hats, and the various accoutrements.

9
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,585

10
00:00:35,585 --> 00:00:36,981
LAURA: They'll be here forever.

11
00:00:36,981 --> 00:00:45,192

my lav. Anyway, welcome. The start of the episode.

12
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:51,454
All day, the energy from the community on the
internet has been just overwhelming. The stories,

13
00:00:51,454 --> 00:00:59,316

because of you guys, all of you. There are so many

31
00:02:08,322 --> 00:02:09,933
LIAM: Such a min-maxer though

32
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:12,384

everybody, and more than anyone that I just

35
00:02:19,986 --> 00:02:25,392
mentioned, the community. You guys, you guys who
have somehow taken our crazy adventure into your

36
00:02:25,392 --> 00:02:32,227
hearts and come along and laughed and cried and
tensed your butthole at the moments we did.

37
00:02:32,227 --> 00:02:34,636
TRAVIS: Tensed. Your buttholes.

38
00:02:34,636 --> 00:02:35,850

39
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,931
LIAM: Never stop.

40
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:43,361
MATT: Never stop. You guys, it is an honor, it's a
privilege, it's overwhelming, it is humbling. It

41
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:48,220
is truly magical, of anything I've experienced
outside of this wonderful girl here.

42
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,865
LAURA: Who's that?

43
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:51,996

Speaking of the characters, I'm going to do a
quick trivia quiz with Taliesin Jaffe here. Master

57
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:51,911

58
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:57,322
Some of them of them are real, some of them are
yoga positions. You tell me which is a character

59
00:03:57,322 --> 00:03:59,556

60

Shameless plug.

89
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,261
TALIESIN: There will be another shameless plug
later.

90
00:04:58,261 --> 00:05:02,267
MATT: We all laugh now, until the announcement of
the Extended Puppy comic series

91
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:03,748
at Comic Con in a few months.

92
00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:08,263
SAM: We're also supposed to give a quick shoutout
to Backblaze for sponsoring the first set of

93
00:05:08,263 --> 00:05:09,508
episodes of...

94
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:13,839
MATT: Of, if you want to go ahead and discuss
this-- who wants to pick this up? We have--

95
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:18,014
SAM: Did I skip? Did I skip? It says on my page!
I'm sorry!

96
00:05:18,014 --> 00:05:24,047
MARISHA: No, it's okay. As a lot of people already
probably know, we announced it in our press

97
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:30,872
rollout, but in honor of the hundredth episode, we
now have episodes zero-- which is all of our

98
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:38,213
backstories-- through ten in podcast form.
Critical Role podcast. And then what's going to

99
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:44,134
start happening is, towards the end of the month,
we want to start rolling out one a day, on work

100
00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:54,332
days. Five a week. Don't kill us. All right? Every
day to catch up, 'til we get back on track.

101
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:56,300
TRAVIS: (sings) It's the end of the month.

102
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,400
TRAVIS & MATT: (sings) Wake up, wake up, wake up,
It's the end of the month.

103
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,499
TRAVIS: Bone Thugs? Thank you, Matt.

104
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:05,445
MARISHA: There's a podcast.

105
00:06:05,445 --> 00:06:11,308
TALIESIN: You can find it on iTunes, you can find
it on Google.

106
00:06:11,308 --> 00:06:13,736
MATT: Google Play Music, or the Geek and Sundry
website.

107
00:06:13,736 --> 00:06:18,337
LAURA: Yeah, there's definitely-- all the links
are on geekandsundry.com.

108
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:21,422
MARISHA: Yes, and Google Play, and yeah. The stuff
like that.

109
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,534
LAURA: Can we talk-- can we talk about this thing
now?

110
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:28,859
MATT: Yes, we can. So, getting into our merch and
part of the celebration of the hundredth episode,

111
00:06:28,859 --> 00:06:30,341
Laura. What have you got in store?

112
00:06:30,341 --> 00:06:35,183
LAURA: Oh, well, thank you for asking, Matthew.
Well, number one, we have our amazing Scanlan

113
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:36,392
concert tees.

114
00:06:36,392 --> 00:06:37,361
MATT: Yes.

115
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:44,250
LAURA: As being worn by the buff and glorious Sam
Riegel. Gorgeous. Just gorgeous, with all the tour

116
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:53,388
cities on the back and everything. And then, also,
a commemorative item for the hundredth episode. We

117
00:06:53,388 --> 00:07:01,563
worked with David Mack-- Who is, like, this
amazing artist. He's-- you know him. Tell some of

118
00:07:01,563 --> 00:07:02,650
his work, 'cause--

119
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,234
LIAM: Oh my gosh, he does covers for everything.
Daredevil--

120
00:07:05,234 --> 00:07:12,257
LAURA: Jessica Jones, I saw Jessica Jones work.
Kabuki. All of it. So he does this amazing

121
00:07:12,257 --> 00:07:17,352
watercolor work and he did an amazing art print
for us, so--

122
00:07:17,352 --> 00:07:18,404
LIAM: Here it is.

123
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,527
LAURA: Without further ado.

124
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:21,991
(cheering)

125
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:24,000
LIAM: (sings) Look at this motherfucker.

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,714
SAM: The intensity. The glamor.

127
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:27,940
LIAM: The splatter.

128
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,512
LAURA: I mean, I'm so excited about this. Number
one, just because it looks so freaking amazing.

129
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:38,449
But then, he incorporated all of this amazing
stuff like quotes and everything that has to do

130
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:45,009
with the characters, and things that mean so much
to us as the characters. And he just worked with

131
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:48,018
us nonstop to try to make the most amazing thing
for you guys,

132
00:07:48,018 --> 00:07:50,579
and I'm so proud of it and so happy.

133
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:51,902
LIAM: It's farkin' beautiful.

134
00:07:51,902 --> 00:07:55,678
LAURA: And we have this amazing gold emblem in the
bottom. I don't know if you can tell, but it's

135
00:07:55,678 --> 00:08:03,195
like extra shiny and fancy. It's a special Vex.
And the paper's really heavy, and so it's super,

136
00:08:03,195 --> 00:08:04,548
super special. So--

137
00:08:04,548 --> 00:08:09,615
ASHLEY: It feels like it was-- like it's a
one-of-a-kind watercolor. Like that's what it-- up

138
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:10,907
close, it's crazy.

139
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,429
LAURA: It looks like he painted it on the page.

140
00:08:12,429 --> 00:08:13,606
SAM: 400 thread count.

141
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:14,888
(laughter)

142
00:08:14,888 --> 00:08:16,273
MATT: And we're only selling the one.

143
00:08:16,273 --> 00:08:17,480
LAURA: Venetian silk.

144
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,168
LIAM: Also, like our shirts that you can't tell
how soft they are until you're wearing them, like

145
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:25,517
the Joe Mad poster that was so beautiful but until
you saw it in person you didn't get it. This thing

146
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:27,613
in person is unbelievable.

147
00:08:27,613 --> 00:08:33,683
LAURA: So yeah. This will be available for one
month and one month only in the Geek and Sundry

148
00:08:33,683 --> 00:08:39,534
store starting today. And then after that, it is
gone. And we're doing the same thing that we did

149
00:08:39,534 --> 00:08:44,147
last time, which is also offering a limited
edition signed version, so if you guys want to

150
00:08:44,147 --> 00:08:48,384
check that out, that's only available for three
weeks so we can try to get as many signatures

151
00:08:48,384 --> 00:08:49,841
before Ashley has to leave.

152
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:51,086
ASHLEY: Sorry.

153
00:08:51,086 --> 00:08:52,413
TRAVIS: (sings) Sorry.

154
00:08:52,413 --> 00:08:56,780
LAURA: So yeah, three weeks from today you can get
the autographed. Starting today, only for three

155
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,668
weeks, and then it's gone forever from the store.

156
00:08:59,668 --> 00:09:01,160
TRAVIS: We already got copies, right?

157
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,274
LAURA: We already have copies, yeah.

158
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:03,530
ASHLEY: I love it so much.

159
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:08,157
LAURA: Thank you David. Thank you for being
amazing. We love you.

160
00:09:08,157 --> 00:09:10,058
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's so nice.

161
00:09:10,058 --> 00:09:15,452
MATT: Thank you, David. Really appreciate it, man.
Awesome. And what else you guys got?

162
00:09:15,452 --> 00:09:26,809
MARISHA: So, The Slayer's Cake-- the members of
The Slayer's Cake-- Yes, have a new product they

163
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:28,116
have just released.

164
00:09:28,116 --> 00:09:29,585
SAM: Is it a baked good of some sort?

165
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:30,575
MARISHA: Well...

166
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:31,601
LAURA: We should show them.

167
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:36,499
MARISHA: I think, you know, they worked so hard on
making a commercial, so we should let them--

168
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:38,321
LAURA: We should let them talk about it.

169
00:09:38,321 --> 00:09:42,270
MARISHA: So here is a commercial from The Slayer's
Cake.

170
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:50,287
SAM: Oh, hello there. I'm Taryon Darrington of The
Slayer's Cake. The Slayer's Cake, your pals in a

171
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:56,293
pastry pinch. Go now? Okay. (clears throat)
Heading to a fancy banquet and not sure if your

172
00:09:56,293 --> 00:10:02,726
hosts are undead? (gasps) Slayer's Cake. Say it's
Winter's Crest, and you don't know what to get

173
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:07,460
your secret Sarenrae. Possibly because you've
never given a gift before. It could happen.

174
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:13,487
Slayer's Cake! We even have miniature cakes for
that special gnome-one in your life.

175
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,194
LAURA: Those are cupcakes, Tary!

176
00:10:15,194 --> 00:10:20,187
SAM: Oh, okay, well, I mean, mm! But hey, if I
still haven't convinced you,

177
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:32,883
don't take my word for it!

178
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:33,959
Are we still--

179
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:42,624
LAURA: Mm, delicious.

180
00:10:42,624 --> 00:10:50,741
ASHLEY: Wow, so light, and I would know, I'm a
cleric. Er, what?

181
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:56,898
SAM: So come on down to the Slayer's Cake, located
in downtown Whitestone. Look for the big

182
00:10:56,898 --> 00:11:02,992
unsanitary bear. You can't miss it! And don't
forget, don't step in bear shit!

183
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:09,263
MARISHA: Bumper VO. The Slayer's Cake, open till
6PM, 7 on weekends. Closed Thursdays for

184
00:11:09,263 --> 00:11:15,087
adventuring. Slayer's Cake aprons available now.
What? We have aprons?

185
00:11:15,087 --> 00:11:17,240
Tary, you didn't tell me we have aprons!

186
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,542
(cheering)

187
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:31,591
LAURA: Wait, wait, can you see me? There it is! So
we had the aprons made, which we're so excited

188
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:39,691
about. I didn't do it, Ben did it, and he's
amazing. Ben did this! He made cupcakes with the

189
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:47,274
Slayer's Cake logo for us for the 100th episode.
We can eat them! So I'm passing them around.

190
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,755
ASHLEY: What if we save them forever?

191
00:11:49,755 --> 00:12:00,369
LAURA: I'm just so excited about this, you guys! I
kind of just wanted to get the apron made so I

192
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:02,060
could personally have it.

193
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,195
MARISHA: I know, I know!

194
00:12:03,195 --> 00:12:05,027
TRAVIS: She's not lying. She wanted to have the
apron.

195
00:12:05,027 --> 00:12:07,951
TALIESIN: Oh! Cupcake down!

196
00:12:07,951 --> 00:12:10,413
MARISHA: It's fine, it's fine. Don't worry about
it. I'm taking that one.

197
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:16,425
LAURA: I don't know if I want to wear this the
whole episode. I might. I'm going to hang out. Oh

198
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:18,628
yeah, save a cupcake for Jon. Wait, Matthew!

199
00:12:18,628 --> 00:12:20,162
TALIESIN: Matt, Matt!

200
00:12:20,162 --> 00:12:31,308
MATT: I don't want any of your shit! Don't want
it! Brian, eat it. I don't want it. Don't! I have

201
00:12:31,308 --> 00:12:32,558
things to do!

202
00:12:32,558 --> 00:12:34,180
MARISHA: Give it to Heder, give it to Heder!

203
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,191
TALIESIN: Heder's got one.

204
00:12:35,191 --> 00:12:42,708
MATT: All righty, so, thank you very much for
those announcements, guys. Other cool things

205
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:48,093
coming up. Our fine friends at Wyrmwood, we have
an awesome spot to show during the break today,

206
00:12:48,093 --> 00:12:52,387
showing some of their awesome craftsmanship and
their partnership, showing off their products as

207
00:12:52,387 --> 00:12:57,084
well. There's an amazing giveaway at the mid-break
that we'll show you guys when we get there, so

208
00:12:57,084 --> 00:13:01,206
stick around for the mid-break when we get to that
point to see the process of what they do and how

209
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:06,276
they do it and all the awesome things they produce
there. You can find their stuff, by the way, at

210
00:13:06,276 --> 00:13:11,867
wyrmwoodgaming.com/criticalrole for free domestic
shipping with the promo code-- Liam?

211
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:13,168
LIAM: Yes!

212
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,707
MATT: What's the promo code?

213
00:13:14,707 --> 00:13:21,791
LIAM: Oh. Uh, I don't have any of the shit in
front of me! Critrole? Is it Critrole now? It's

214
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,327
Critrole again? It's back?

215
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:28,351
SAM: Wyrmwood's has always been Critrole, hasn't
it?

216
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:29,666
LIAM: Critrole.

217
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,720
LAURA: It's hard to remember because it's been
such a long time since you said it.

218
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,604
LIAM: No one told me.

219
00:13:34,604 --> 00:13:40,299
MATT: That's okay. Anyway, thank you very much.
Looking forward to that at the break. Also, those

220
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:44,522
asking about campaign guide information, for the
Tal'dorei campaign guide. All that is up on the

221
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:48,378
Green Ronin website. You can go there, go ahead
and find out when it's coming out, how to find it,

222
00:13:48,378 --> 00:13:56,241
all that fun stuff, and I hope you like it. Soon,
I guess. Also, we have an awesome infographic up

223
00:13:56,241 --> 00:14:03,280
on social media and the website, put together from
our friends at CritRoleStats, Andrew and all you

224
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:09,479
awesome guys. So they're awesome, go check that
out, a lot of fun trivia elements about how

225
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:14,841
long we've been running the show, and apparently
how many nonexistent characters live in my brain.

226
00:14:14,841 --> 00:14:16,191
We're in the 500s.

227
00:14:16,191 --> 00:14:17,886
LIAM: It's just the tip of the iceberg, Matt.

228
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:20,154
MATT: That has to be certifiable on some level.

229
00:14:20,154 --> 00:14:22,070
LIAM: Campaign four, I'm waiting for it.

230
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,012
MATT: Give it time, I'm sure.

231
00:14:24,012 --> 00:14:27,164
SAM: Matt, that soda pop looks like you're
drinking it out of a wine glass.

232
00:14:27,164 --> 00:14:30,088
MATT: We are running out of receptacles for soda
pop, Sam.

233
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:31,327
SAM: Okay.

234
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:46,322
MATT: Also, I'm going to be at A-Kon tomorrow. Fly
out in the morning to Texas. So, looking forward

235
00:14:46,322 --> 00:14:48,007
to seeing you guys in Dallas.

236
00:14:48,007 --> 00:14:49,661
LAURA: What were you thinking?

237
00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:52,330
MATT: I agreed to this a long time ago! And it
all just coordinated.

238
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,841
LIAM: Freakin' Willy Loman, man.

239
00:14:54,923 --> 00:14:56,578
ASHLEY: Do you at least have a late flight?

240
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:57,793
MATT: No.

241
00:14:57,793 --> 00:14:59,302
TRAVIS: Does it start with an 'AM'?

242
00:14:59,302 --> 00:15:00,497
MATT: Yes.

243
00:15:00,497 --> 00:15:02,666
LIAM: Take a break. Run away upstate, for the
summertime.

244
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,385
TRAVIS: Take a break! Sing it, Liam.

245
00:15:04,385 --> 00:15:05,698
LIAM: Take a break!

246
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:07,296
MATT: Nonstop.

247
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:08,711
SAM: Halfway through announcements.

248
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:12,238
LAURA: Our infographic is no longer valid!

249
00:15:12,238 --> 00:15:17,350
MARISHA: Completely outdated, immediately.

250
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,754
MATT: That's okay, it was nice while it lasted. So
see you guys at A-Kon in Dallas, Texas. Talks

251
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:27,480
Machina, always live, Tuesdays, 7PM Pacific time
on Twitch and Alpha. Talk about this crazy episode

252
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,500
next week. Hosted by the fantastic Brian Wayne
Foster. Thank you for eating my cupcake. Still,

253
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,044
surprisingly. All right, Signal Boost, new
episode, with?

254
00:15:37,044 --> 00:15:41,869
MARISHA: Jeff Lewis. Everyone knows him and loves
him from the Guild. Check it out.

255
00:15:41,869 --> 00:15:43,558
MATT: Or as Waluigi in "There Will Be Brawl."

256
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:48,579
MARISHA: Or as Waluigi. He's been so many things.
Everyone knows who Jeff Lewis is. Go watch it.

257
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:53,218
MATT: There you go. And we have some other cool
announcements coming up in the coming weeks, so

258
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:57,130
keep an eye out and an ear out for each episode.
We'll have a few more fun things that we can

259
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:01,445
announce as the month goes on. So, that, I
believe, will bring us to --

260
00:16:01,445 --> 00:16:07,996
LIAM: Well, I have a little thing, I just have to
share this. Friend of the show, Kiki-- not our

261
00:16:07,996 --> 00:16:13,026
Kiki, the other Kiki who's made so many vestiges--
brought me a little something today.

262
00:16:13,026 --> 00:16:18,028
(laughing)

263
00:16:18,028 --> 00:16:21,222
LIAM: There it is. Got to lose those. Oh yeah.

264
00:16:21,222 --> 00:16:24,152
LAURA: No, no, no, maybe Vax needs glasses to see
in the dark.

265
00:16:24,152 --> 00:16:36,551
LIAM: Maybe he does! Maybe he does. Look at my
shoulders! I'm like Travis Willingham! Is this

266
00:16:36,551 --> 00:16:37,904
what it feels like, Travis?

267
00:16:37,904 --> 00:16:40,260
TRAVIS: Yeah, I have to put them on under each
shirt. It's a real bitch.

268
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:47,457
LIAM: Man, I've been Crossfitting all day! That's
like stitching knitwear, right?

269
00:16:47,457 --> 00:16:49,086
Crossfitting all day.

270
00:16:49,086 --> 00:16:50,704
LAURA: Ah, you're hitting me with your shoulders.

271
00:16:50,704 --> 00:16:52,120
LIAM: Cacaw!

272
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,337
LAURA: That's amazing.

273
00:16:53,337 --> 00:16:55,497
LIAM: Thank you, Kiki. Thank you. Oh my god.

274
00:16:55,497 --> 00:16:56,806
LAURA: You're phenomenal!

275
00:16:56,806 --> 00:17:00,871
LIAM: This will sit in my office and scare my
children. Yeah.

276
00:17:00,871 --> 00:17:03,997
MATT: Appreciate it, Medhiv. All right, guys. We
ready?

277
00:17:03,997 --> 00:17:11,408
Let's dive in now to tonight's episode of
Critical Role.

278
00:17:11,408 --> 00:18:40,082
[dramatic music]

279
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:48,539
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. So. You all right,
Jon?

280
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,029
TALIESIN: He's jacking in.

281
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,608
SAM: He's jacking in.

282
00:18:51,608 --> 00:18:58,963
MATT: And the lava's connected. Welcome back, Jon!
Glad you could join us again.

283
00:18:58,963 --> 00:19:01,426
(cheering)

284
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:06,200
MATT: All righty. So, picking up where we left off
last time, Vox Machina had just completed their

285
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,398
adventure in the distant countryside of Wildmount,
interfacing with the Darrington family and

286
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:20,043
apparently their long-acquired debt with the
Myriad, a criminal syndicate on that side of the

287
00:19:20,043 --> 00:19:25,471
world. After making a deal that would salvage
elements of the Darrington family, you made your

288
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:34,258
way back and encountered a half-orc bardbarian by
the way of Lionel, who was there on behest of his

289
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:46,286
boss, Aes Adon, or, as you were immediately
referred to as, the Meat Man. Immediately. You

290
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:50,037
were brought to a nearby tavern in Whitestone
where the vicinity had been rented out entirely

291
00:19:50,037 --> 00:19:57,266
and you met with a large, intimidating-looking
gentleman. Scarred, pockmarked, ready to go ahead

292
00:19:57,266 --> 00:20:04,413
and wheel and deal some business with you. After
some interesting conversation and some sly

293
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:11,825
insights by Vex'ahlia and Keyleth, it was
discovered that the Meat Man was indeed your old

294
00:20:11,825 --> 00:20:17,503
compatriot Scanlan under an illusion, to attempt
to notify you that he'd discovered something quite

295
00:20:17,503 --> 00:20:26,487
dangerous on his side of Exandria. You discovered
that this fantastic bardbarian Lionel had been

296
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:32,024
working for him under his Meat Man guise in
Ank'Harel for the better part of a year, and while

297
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:37,553
set on a mission with a number of other
compatriots of his, Lionel had stumbled upon an

298
00:20:37,553 --> 00:20:44,695
area called the Smouldercrown, a mountain range not
terribly far from Ank'harel, what seemed to

299
00:20:44,695 --> 00:20:48,665
be a cavern structure that led to an underground
pyramid, similar to the ziggurat that you guys had

300
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:53,296
been keeping an eye on underneath Whitestone,
which also contained its own small black spherical

301
00:20:53,296 --> 00:20:58,792
orb in which they were feeding magical items
towards, it looked like. However, they were

302
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:04,135
discovered in that tunnel and Lionel was the only
one to escape with his life. The rest fell behind

303
00:21:04,135 --> 00:21:09,490
and were left for dead. Upon notifying Scanlan, or
the Meat Man, of this information, he knew it

304
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:14,781
was pertinent to return and get this to you in
person. After which, apologies were made; some

305
00:21:14,781 --> 00:21:19,528
were accepted, some were not. But it was generally
decided by the team that, based on this

306
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:23,944
information, you needed to make your way to
Ank'Harel post-haste and discover what exactly

307
00:21:23,944 --> 00:21:28,788
resides beneath the mountains of the Smouldercrown.
You gathered up the following moment, well rested,

308
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:34,033
all met up at the base of the Sun Tree in the
center of the square, and that's where we left

309
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:38,410
off. So, as you've gathered your materials, your
weapons, your armor, what you think you may need

310
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:44,068
for this trek, you've all gathered around the base
of the Sun Tree. Some shade has been thrown, but

311
00:21:44,068 --> 00:21:49,394
you have gathered. So, what do you wish to do?

312
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:52,209
SAM: We've gone through the Sun Tree or not?

313
00:21:52,209 --> 00:21:55,736
LAURA: No, we're right outside the Sun Tree, just
before we've left Whitestone.

314
00:21:55,736 --> 00:22:00,891
TALIESIN: I just want to make a point that I've
alerted everybody in the government-- everybody

315
00:22:00,891 --> 00:22:05,754
reasonable-- where we're going, why we're going,
and that there should be people watching the

316
00:22:05,754 --> 00:22:09,157
Ziggurat underneath Whitestone 24/7 while we're on
this mission.

317
00:22:09,157 --> 00:22:11,869
Anything happens, be prepared for anything.

318
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:13,450
LAURA: You're so brilliant, darling.

319
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:19,234
MARISHA: I don't understand. There's not a lot of
shade. It's noon.

320
00:22:19,234 --> 00:22:22,318
TALIESIN: We've been throwing it, it's not here.

321
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,189
LIAM: Thrown from a distance.

322
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:35,130
LAURA: I think we should probably head out.

323
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:38,940
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. Where in Ank'harel?

324
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,894
LAURA: Where are we going, Scanlan, again? Shadowy
Mountain?

325
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:46,123
MARISHA: Do I know anyplace that's near?

326
00:22:46,123 --> 00:22:48,463
MATT: You've been to Ank'harel, you've been around
quite a bit, and you've seen a number of trees.

327
00:22:48,463 --> 00:22:53,559
The city itself, within the walls, through magical
means or otherwise, there is an interior oasis

328
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:59,727
within the city itself. There is the sand and dust
that blows in from the outside desert that

329
00:22:59,727 --> 00:23:06,017
surrounds it in Marquet, but there are a number of
ponds and rivers and large palm trees and other

330
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:11,342
types of trees that are risen. There are small
clusters that form almost minute forests

331
00:23:11,342 --> 00:23:17,043
throughout the city, whether they be a park to
wander through or a means of harvesting whatever

332
00:23:17,043 --> 00:23:20,762
the trees have to offer for the people that live
there. But you've seen a number of trees and it's

333
00:23:20,762 --> 00:23:22,186
easy enough to make your way there.

334
00:23:22,186 --> 00:23:24,051
MARISHA: Okay. I'll do the oasis.

335
00:23:24,051 --> 00:23:31,746
MATT: Okay. As Keyleth reaches out, Lionel, you
watch as the small half-elf red-headed girl

336
00:23:31,746 --> 00:23:35,878
reaches out and touches the tree, and suddenly the
trunk splits open at the base, and you watch as

337
00:23:35,878 --> 00:23:38,739
what seems to be a glowing doorway of divine
energy appears.

338
00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:42,056
MARISHA: Go, go! Six seconds, go! Go, go!

339
00:23:42,056 --> 00:23:44,950
TALIESIN: I help shove.

340
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:50,110
SAM: I should note that Doty is coming with us as
well.

341
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,025
LIAM: Hey, quickly!

342
00:23:52,025 --> 00:23:56,553
LAURA: Sure, I'll note that Trinket is coming as
well, even though it's a fucking given.

343
00:23:56,553 --> 00:23:58,891
LIAM: I shove my sister through the tree.

344
00:23:58,891 --> 00:24:00,613
TRAVIS: Warming up.

345
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:03,650
LAURA: I mean, just kidding, I love you Tary.

346
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,516
LIAM: You're not here, I just shoved you through
the tree. I made it up, I created it, right there

347
00:24:06,516 --> 00:24:07,923
on the fly.

348
00:24:07,923 --> 00:24:12,396
TRAVIS: We all go through the tree, yeah?

349
00:24:12,396 --> 00:24:13,802
ALL: Yeah!

350
00:24:13,802 --> 00:24:21,400
MATT: After an incredibly long, well-stretched six
seconds, you all eventually make your way through

351
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:27,787
the doorway into the center of Ank'harel. The
temperature difference is stark, it's immediate.

352
00:24:27,787 --> 00:24:33,124
Whereas you had a gradual transition to Ank'harel
last time you were there, going from the

353
00:24:33,124 --> 00:24:37,744
Whitestone colder, more damp climate to the
immediate dry heat of the central Marquet desert

354
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:44,058
is just immediate, it's uncomfortable-- it may be
comfortable for some of you-- and your mouth

355
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:49,790
immediately dries out for a moment, and you have
to adjust to the new atmosphere. Looking around

356
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:54,478
you, you've emerged from the outside of one of the
central oases, which is kind of near the Lux Run

357
00:24:54,478 --> 00:25:04,105
where you originally entered the city. There, you
see the streets are bustling and busy. It's

358
00:25:04,105 --> 00:25:10,308
starting to get closer to later in the evening
now, on this part of Exandria. You can see the

359
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:15,992
sky's starting to get a little darker. There's an
element of dusk that will probably be setting in

360
00:25:15,992 --> 00:25:20,022
about an hour. But here you are.

361
00:25:20,022 --> 00:25:21,971
LAURA: Well, Scanlan?

362
00:25:21,971 --> 00:25:27,244
JON: Why didn't we do this before? It's so much
faster! Why did we take a 500-day journey?

363
00:25:27,244 --> 00:25:30,827
SAM: It was just ten days, first of all.

364
00:25:30,827 --> 00:25:35,482
JON: Again, I don't get days. Why don't we just
make that tree open up?

365
00:25:35,482 --> 00:25:41,566
SAM: I am very powerful, but there's some things
that I can't do, all right? Ever since you found

366
00:25:41,566 --> 00:25:44,979
out I was short, you're much snappier and snippier
with me.

367
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:49,110
JON: You're just much smaller, I mean, I didn't
realize.

368
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:52,749
Why don't you just go back to looking like Aes?

369
00:25:52,749 --> 00:25:54,177
SAM: Maybe I should.

370
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,489
TRAVIS: Maybe you should.

371
00:25:55,489 --> 00:26:00,274
SAM: Yeah, because I'm known around these parts,
so that would probably be better.

372
00:26:00,274 --> 00:26:05,353
LAURA: Does Aes wear this stupid headband? Because
it's really fucking distracting.

373
00:26:05,353 --> 00:26:07,553
JON: What headband?

374
00:26:07,553 --> 00:26:09,501
MATT: Perfect.

375
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:16,345
SAM: I'll put on the hat and become the Meat Man.

376
00:26:16,345 --> 00:26:23,080
MATT: So you step off to the side to a point where
you're not being noticed and take on, once again,

377
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:29,634
the illusory facade of the Meat Man. Stepping out
into the sunlight once more, you see the imposing

378
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:32,218
figure of the Meat Man now amongst you.

379
00:26:32,218 --> 00:26:35,464
LAURA: You're so scary and big. Do you have a
place that you always stay?

380
00:26:35,464 --> 00:26:38,479
SAM: I have many places.

381
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:40,286
LAURA: That's what I figured.

382
00:26:40,286 --> 00:26:43,025
LIAM: I try sticking my fingers through the fake
head a little bit.

383
00:26:43,025 --> 00:26:47,347
SAM: Get off! Get off! Stop it!

384
00:26:47,347 --> 00:26:52,531
JON: No wonder you said hands off!

385
00:26:52,531 --> 00:26:54,828
LAURA: You didn't touch him this entire year?

386
00:26:54,828 --> 00:26:58,229
JON: He always said hands off. No matter how many
times I tried.

387
00:26:58,229 --> 00:27:01,815
ASHLEY: You never went to brothels or anything
like that then, I guess.

388
00:27:01,815 --> 00:27:03,909
TALIESIN: Probably not together.

389
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:11,019
MARISHA: Have you been hugged in a year? Has
anyone given you a hug? I give him a hug.

390
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:17,682
JON: Are you trying to go through me to him?

391
00:27:17,682 --> 00:27:20,210
MARISHA: No, I'm just giving you a hug!

392
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:28,840
JON: That gives me, like, 50 extra attack points
or something, right? I feel like something cool

393
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,358
when someone hugs me.

394
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:32,694
MARISHA: Can I use my Inspiring Leader feat?

395
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:34,689
MATT: If you would like to take a moment to give
everyone hugs

396
00:27:34,689 --> 00:27:36,606
as part of your Inspiring Leader, sure.

397
00:27:36,606 --> 00:27:38,060
MARISHA: You know what, guys?

398
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,770
SAM: Oh, she's speeching.

399
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:48,627
MARISHA: Human contact's important, you know? So
come on, come on, let's all group hug! Group hug!

400
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:51,831
TALIESIN: No! No!

401
00:27:51,831 --> 00:27:53,401
JON: Can I hug everybody else?

402
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:56,024
SAM: The Meat Man does not hug.

403
00:27:56,024 --> 00:28:02,820
TRAVIS: This is a ten-minute huddle?

404
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:06,356
MATT: It's a ten-minute, like, hug it out.

405
00:28:06,356 --> 00:28:09,000
LAURA: Ten minutes is so awkward!

406
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,099
MATT: I know! And not in Keyleth's bailiwick at
all!

407
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:16,259
TRAVIS: Are we attracting any awkward looks?

408
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:20,544
LAURA: I feel like I would have abstained from the
ten-minute group hug.

409
00:28:20,544 --> 00:28:23,918
TALIESIN: I would have brought you into it.

410
00:28:23,918 --> 00:28:27,756
MARISHA: I keep trying to grab Vex. Come on! Come
on, hug it out!

411
00:28:27,756 --> 00:28:30,716
MATT: So, you brought Scanlan and Tary for this.

412
00:28:30,716 --> 00:28:31,619
SAM: Yes.

413
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:32,755
MATT: Are they both?

414
00:28:32,755 --> 00:28:34,273
SAM: Scanlan stepped out. Tary's in.

415
00:28:34,273 --> 00:28:40,233
MATT: So everyone except for Scanlan gets 17
temporary hit points.

416
00:28:40,233 --> 00:28:45,601
LAURA: Thanks, Kiki! No, no, no, Percy brought me
in.

417
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:48,987
MARISHA: Brought her out of her comfort bubble.

418
00:28:48,987 --> 00:28:54,542
MATT: As you all slowly begin to realize the
slight display you've given in the center of the

419
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:58,042
town, especially those of you in your darker,
heavier leathers

420
00:28:58,042 --> 00:29:00,219
amongst this very warm, open air.

421
00:29:00,219 --> 00:29:03,821
LAURA: Oh, I thought we knew we were going to
Ank'harel so we dressed for it. That's what we

422
00:29:03,821 --> 00:29:05,068
said the last episode.

423
00:29:05,068 --> 00:29:06,072
MATT: Did you?

424
00:29:06,072 --> 00:29:10,702
LAURA: That's what <i>you</i> said, actually. You said
"you all showed up dressed for Ank'harel."

425
00:29:10,702 --> 00:29:12,622
LIAM: My armor is fire set.

426
00:29:12,622 --> 00:29:14,488
MATT: Okay, I'll trust you on that.

427
00:29:14,488 --> 00:29:17,280
LAURA: I feel like you said it?

428
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:22,201
MATT: You would've, it's fine. But it's less the
attire. You're still wearing your armor, I assume.

429
00:29:22,201 --> 00:29:23,295
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes.

430
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:24,645
MATT: So, you're still in heavy leathers.

431
00:29:24,645 --> 00:29:26,896
LIAM: Yeah, we're just doing the whole Lawrence of
Arabia.

432
00:29:26,896 --> 00:29:30,939
MATT: So you're still a display of people in
heavy leather hugging for ten minutes in the

433
00:29:30,939 --> 00:29:32,598
middle of this open thoroughfare.

434
00:29:32,598 --> 00:29:34,878
LIAM: Yeah, we're still very awkward. At all
times.

435
00:29:34,878 --> 00:29:38,472
MATT: So it's not like all of a sudden there's a
crowd gathered around you. But occasionally

436
00:29:38,472 --> 00:29:42,908
there's a few merchants across the way that are
like, "So, anyway, as I was saying..."

437
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:44,751
LIAM: Bidet!

438
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:46,114
LAURA: Be pleased!

439
00:29:46,114 --> 00:29:47,380
MATT: "Be pleased."

440
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:52,065
TRAVIS: You guys are all saying it wrong. I don't
know why. Vax can pick it up, it's not that hard.

441
00:29:52,065 --> 00:29:53,529
LIAM: I am very smart.

442
00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:54,864
LAURA: Where do we go?

443
00:29:54,864 --> 00:29:56,390
SAM: Come with me.

444
00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:02,755
MATT: You watch as the Meat Man leads you down
four or five different streets, dodging through a

445
00:30:02,755 --> 00:30:09,398
couple of alleyways and off onto the
southern-eastern side of Ank'harel. There is a

446
00:30:09,398 --> 00:30:15,924
modest-looking tobacco shop that is in a poorer
district, it's a little run-down. Run-down

447
00:30:15,924 --> 00:30:22,911
compared to a lot of Ank'harel, which is pretty colorful
and very well-kept. So, it's pretty decent,

448
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:30,118
average fare for Emon, considered the poorer side
of Ank'harel. But you-- (laughs)

449
00:30:30,118 --> 00:30:35,991
SAM: Was that a fart?

450
00:30:35,991 --> 00:30:39,014
MATT: It's one of the various beasts of burden
that you're walking past in the streets of

451
00:30:39,014 --> 00:30:42,040
Ank'harel. (fart sound)

452
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,100
LAURA: That was awesome.

453
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,365
MATT: To be fair, sometimes the Slayer's Cakes get
a little...

454
00:30:46,365 --> 00:30:48,401
LIAM: They're rich.

455
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:51,235
LAURA: We're working out the ingredients.

456
00:30:51,235 --> 00:30:59,392
MATT: Adventurers can't get it right all the time.
So you come to this modest tobacco shop. As you

457
00:30:59,392 --> 00:31:07,300
lead them into the interior, one of your
employees, Doran, who is a rather scrawny-looking

458
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:15,015
boy maybe of 22, 23, completely shaved head,
tanned skin, a little sallow, but he's sitting

459
00:31:15,015 --> 00:31:23,041
there, balancing a long, thin, almost like a
railroad-spike-type metal rod. He's just kind of

460
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:26,451
balancing it over the wood, and as soon as the
door opens, he fumbles.

461
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:31,227
"Ah. Aes. It is a pleasure to have you back."

462
00:31:31,227 --> 00:31:34,374
SAM: How are things in my absence?

463
00:31:34,374 --> 00:31:42,637
MATT: "They have been well. You've only been gone
for a few hours, but they've been uneventful."

464
00:31:42,637 --> 00:31:55,330
SAM: Oh, yes, yes, that's right, yes. Any new
reports of the hooded people?

465
00:31:55,330 --> 00:32:00,499
MATT: "None within the town, not since last-- oh,
hi, Lionel!"

466
00:32:00,499 --> 00:32:01,859
JON: Hey, what's up?

467
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:05,047
MATT: "It's good to see you. Anyway."

468
00:32:05,047 --> 00:32:08,420
(laughter)

469
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,053
JON: You want a hug? It makes you, like,
super-strong.

470
00:32:11,053 --> 00:32:13,073
MATT: "Really?"

471
00:32:13,073 --> 00:32:15,224
JON: Yeah. At least, that's what I--

472
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,890
SAM: No fraternizing.

473
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:22,101
MATT: "But anyway." And he reaches down and pulls
a small wooden lever, and it's like you see he's

474
00:32:22,101 --> 00:32:26,675
having to struggle with it. And as he does so, you
hear the scraping of wood, and a chain-winch

475
00:32:26,675 --> 00:32:33,971
going. You watch as one of the small furrows in
the back corner slowly lifts up and reveals a

476
00:32:33,971 --> 00:32:38,113
narrow staircase that leads down into a
subterranean area.

477
00:32:38,113 --> 00:32:39,821
LIAM: This is kind of cool.

478
00:32:39,821 --> 00:32:43,628
JON: It's really awesome. You guys should-- we
should go. This is like our cool hideout.

479
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,916
MARISHA: What was the guy's name again?

480
00:32:45,916 --> 00:32:47,044
MATT: Doran.

481
00:32:47,044 --> 00:32:48,460
MARISHA: Doran.

482
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,976
TRAVIS: Doran, you known Aes long?

483
00:32:51,976 --> 00:32:55,205
MATT: "For a number of months, yes."

484
00:32:55,205 --> 00:32:57,393
TRAVIS: Yeah. Good guy?

485
00:32:57,393 --> 00:33:05,129
MATT: "We don't converse often, but he pays well,
and the work is-- the work is very rewarding."

486
00:33:05,129 --> 00:33:08,650
TRAVIS: Right. Does he have a firm handshake?

487
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,868
MATT: (stammers)

488
00:33:10,868 --> 00:33:16,572
TRAVIS: You should find out. Yeah, no, shake his
hand. No, go ahead, right now.

489
00:33:16,572 --> 00:33:20,661
MATT: "I do not presume to want to-- I mean,
unless you would want to?"

490
00:33:20,661 --> 00:33:21,872
SAM: No.

491
00:33:21,872 --> 00:33:23,860
MATT: "Okay, yes, I am sorry, I do not mean to--"

492
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:27,699
TRAVIS: In his custom, 'no' means 'yes, I crave it
deeply'.

493
00:33:27,699 --> 00:33:30,273
MATT: Make a deception check.

494
00:33:30,273 --> 00:33:33,194
TALIESIN: Your voice got really high during that.

495
00:33:33,194 --> 00:33:34,642
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

496
00:33:34,642 --> 00:33:36,567
LAURA: What'd you roll? What'd you roll?

497
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:37,896
TRAVIS: 19.

498
00:33:37,896 --> 00:33:50,741
MATT: 19. (laughs) "Uh. I mean, if you--"

499
00:33:50,741 --> 00:33:54,096
TRAVIS: Known him for years. Really.

500
00:33:54,096 --> 00:33:57,764
SAM: I will just walk by him and go down into the
hidey-hole.

501
00:33:57,764 --> 00:34:04,223
MATT: Okay. "I think you have some incorrect
intel, my friend."

502
00:34:04,223 --> 00:34:08,858
TRAVIS: No, I think you're probably gonna need a
new job pretty soon. That was a diss. It's all

503
00:34:08,858 --> 00:34:11,648
right. Just look elsewhere. That's all I'm
saying.

504
00:34:11,648 --> 00:34:17,566
MATT: He sits back on his stool and takes his
little rod and jams it into the wood and huffs as

505
00:34:17,566 --> 00:34:22,409
you guys all make your way down there. Which, both
Lionel and Grog, you guys have to cannonball up

506
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:26,657
real tight to make it through the corridor. You
drag your way through by pulling on the little

507
00:34:26,657 --> 00:34:33,175
bits of wood and earth that mark the exterior
walls of this descending staircase. The smell is

508
00:34:33,175 --> 00:34:42,272
musty. It's not damp, but you can sense that there
is a smell of tobacco. You thought, oh, this

509
00:34:42,272 --> 00:34:46,372
tobacco shop's a front. As you go down, you see
about ten feet down there is a large storage room

510
00:34:46,372 --> 00:34:51,773
that contains barrels of dried tobacco of all
sorts, and has a very rich, pungent, but also like

511
00:34:51,773 --> 00:35:01,446
a nice spice scent to it in places. Spice. Ah! You
lead them on down to the far end of the hallway.

512
00:35:01,446 --> 00:35:05,648
There is another door that is locked. You pull out
a set of keys, unlock it, open it. It leads down

513
00:35:05,648 --> 00:35:11,081
another hallway, and then eventually what looks to be
some smaller sets of barracks rooms. You see a few

514
00:35:11,081 --> 00:35:17,795
doors that are ajar and empty with some beds
inside. You lead down another 20 or so feet to

515
00:35:17,795 --> 00:35:21,571
another chamber. And as it opens up, inside, you
can see there are three tables arranged in a

516
00:35:21,571 --> 00:35:25,419
triangular pattern, and at the far end of the
table, there is a single-- what looks like a

517
00:35:25,419 --> 00:35:33,223
throne-like chair. It's very well-crafted. It's
gold-leafed in places, it has intricate scrolling

518
00:35:33,223 --> 00:35:40,390
on the sides and where the armrests are, and there
you see an individual with a hooded cloak and a

519
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:47,098
deep, bluish-purple color with what looks like a
red crimson slash design around the back, a number

520
00:35:47,098 --> 00:35:51,834
of jewelry, and they're facing away, speaking
towards the chair, for there on the chair sits an

521
00:35:51,834 --> 00:36:00,437
identical large, looming human male with long,
dark hair and mustache, pockmarked skin, and is

522
00:36:00,437 --> 00:36:02,043
mid-conversation.

523
00:36:02,043 --> 00:36:05,203
LAURA: You guys really should plan this out
better.

524
00:36:05,203 --> 00:36:13,566
SAM: Bit of warning. Don't use her name. All
right, so I'll just walk up to them.

525
00:36:13,566 --> 00:36:15,128
MATT: You walk up to the two of them?

526
00:36:15,128 --> 00:36:16,482
SAM: Yeah, sure.

527
00:36:16,482 --> 00:36:21,806
MATT: All right. The cloaked figure is in the
middle of conversation, and speaking Marquesian,

528
00:36:21,806 --> 00:36:30,562
which you understand, to the effect of, "We've been
looking, and apparently all the shipments have

529
00:36:30,562 --> 00:36:34,695
"been diverted and held off until--" And hears the
footsteps and turns over and sees you. "Oh."

530
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:37,429
(confused sounds)

531
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:42,676
LAURA: (clears throat) Twins. Funny.

532
00:36:42,676 --> 00:36:45,248
LIAM: What are the odds?

533
00:36:45,248 --> 00:36:49,337
MATT: Deception check.

534
00:36:49,337 --> 00:36:54,852
LAURA: Motherfuck. Oh, you know, like 11.

535
00:36:54,852 --> 00:37:06,009
MATT: "I, um." Begins to pull a small blade out to
the side. "I am under the impression that perhaps

536
00:37:06,009 --> 00:37:13,646
"one of you is a doppelganger, and whoever my boss
is, would you please raise your hand?"

537
00:37:13,646 --> 00:37:16,593
SAM: I do not raise my hand.

538
00:37:16,593 --> 00:37:24,680
MATT: The other one does. "Aes, what do we do?"
And puts the blade forward, and you watch as the

539
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:32,679
other Meat Man on the throne just says, "We do
nothing. I know this man, and we will do our

540
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:43,682
"business. Tell no one what you saw here, but if
two more leave, I have been taken by its will and

541
00:37:43,682 --> 00:37:50,138
"you'll have to kill us both. I'm just kidding,
that's a complete joke. But no, seriously, you

542
00:37:50,138 --> 00:37:52,259
"really-- go, go." And the--

543
00:37:52,259 --> 00:37:54,215
JON: Should I go kill him?

544
00:37:54,215 --> 00:37:55,761
SAM: No, no.

545
00:37:55,761 --> 00:37:57,880
MATT: The person with the cloak kind of--

546
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,210
JON: It's fine, I won't kill you.

547
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:04,963
MATT: "Thank you. Be pleased." And darts out of
the room real fast. The other Meat Man on the

548
00:38:04,963 --> 00:38:10,376
throne goes, "Oh, Verath, I'm gonna work real hard
to try and convince him other of that."

549
00:38:10,376 --> 00:38:12,249
SAM: Sorry about that.

550
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:16,009
MATT: (clears throat) "It is all right."

551
00:38:16,009 --> 00:38:19,598
LAURA: Good to see you again.

552
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:27,481
MATT: "Good to see you as well. You all look...
spry. You look alive."

553
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:31,259
SAM: Is anyone in the room, now, Matt, besides--

554
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:34,081
MATT: Besides you guys? No, it's just you guys and
Lionel.

555
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:38,587
SAM: All right, so. We can drop all of the
illusions. They all know what's going on now.

556
00:38:38,587 --> 00:38:42,492
MATT: Looks earnestly at Lionel.

557
00:38:42,492 --> 00:38:44,578
SAM: Even Chod.

558
00:38:44,578 --> 00:38:47,136
JON: Lionel.

559
00:38:47,136 --> 00:38:51,203
MATT: "Aye, very well." And you watch as the Meat
Man on the throne suddenly diminishes into a

560
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:58,040
smaller, gnome figure as well, only female, with
short, almost buzzed sides of her dark brunette

561
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:08,369
hair that poofs into a curl there. You can see
she's also much tanner than you remember. She is

562
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:13,312
wearing what looks to be a leather tunic that's
straining against her rather large muscles for a

563
00:39:13,312 --> 00:39:16,234
small gnome, it looks like she's been making sure
that nobody messes

564
00:39:16,234 --> 00:39:17,750
with her while she's in the city.

565
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,975
LAURA: Shit. Is she buff now?

566
00:39:18,975 --> 00:39:20,228
MATT: She's pretty buff.

567
00:39:20,228 --> 00:39:21,273
LAURA: Shit.

568
00:39:21,273 --> 00:39:24,152
MARISHA: You got a haircut! I love it.

569
00:39:24,152 --> 00:39:30,823
MATT: "You know. The hot weather around here is a
bit of a bitch this time of the year, so best to

570
00:39:30,823 --> 00:39:34,079
"get it taken care of. Anyway. What the fuck are
you all doing here?"

571
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:41,870
SAM: I went to get them to tell them about the
thing that we found.

572
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:44,505
MATT: "Right, okay. Great."

573
00:39:44,505 --> 00:39:50,259
SAM: I was going to escort them there. Do you
think you have things handled if we go for a day?

574
00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:53,146
MATT: "Oh, that's fine, I've only been dealing
with this for the past two and half weeks without

575
00:39:53,146 --> 00:39:58,974
"you just fine, no one's noticed, until you came up
inside looking the same as me. That's great!"

576
00:39:58,974 --> 00:40:01,707
SAM: Sorry, I didn't know you were throning.

577
00:40:01,707 --> 00:40:06,942
MARISHA: 'Throning'.

578
00:40:06,942 --> 00:40:08,354
TRAVIS: Yeah, is that a thing?

579
00:40:08,354 --> 00:40:10,628
SAM: Well, when we're in command, yeah.

580
00:40:10,628 --> 00:40:13,110
MATT: "It's not called throning, don't listen to
him."

581
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,900
LAURA: How long have you been here?

582
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:25,373
MATT: "Been here? Ank'harel? I've lost track of
time. Better part of maybe eight months, nine months?"

583
00:40:25,373 --> 00:40:29,664
TRAVIS: We've heard you've risen through the ranks.
Very successful, you are.

584
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,969
MATT: "Not too bad, if I do say so myself."

585
00:40:31,969 --> 00:40:33,275
TRAVIS: Well done.

586
00:40:33,275 --> 00:40:35,219
MATT: "This one's almost ruined us a few times."

587
00:40:35,219 --> 00:40:36,774
TRAVIS: That's not surprising.

588
00:40:36,774 --> 00:40:38,703
LIAM: How are things with the old man?

589
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:43,478
MATT: "They're fine. Talks about you lot an awful
lot."

590
00:40:43,478 --> 00:40:44,863
LIAM: Oh, really?

591
00:40:44,863 --> 00:40:46,718
SAM: Not true, not true.

592
00:40:46,718 --> 00:40:51,763
ASHLEY: Did you have a good year together? Sort
of, I guess. That was the last time we saw you.

593
00:40:51,763 --> 00:40:52,969
Have things been good?

594
00:40:52,969 --> 00:40:56,678
MATT: She pats the side of her coin purse, which
you can see is rather thick and makes a heavy

595
00:40:56,678 --> 00:41:03,869
(clinking) of clinking coin. "Not been too bad, if
I say so myself. More than I ever made playing violin."

596
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:05,864
TALIESIN: Profit suits you well.

597
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:10,656
MARISHA: I don't know if she was referring to
monetary wealth, but sure.

598
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:13,905
TRAVIS: Well, if you can't have an earnest
relationship with someone,

599
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:15,545
at least she's got money.

600
00:41:15,545 --> 00:41:19,759
TALIESIN: It's also very hard to put an earnest
relationship in a coin purse.

601
00:41:19,759 --> 00:41:26,765
MATT: "Anyway. So. What can I do for you, or have
you just come by to say hi?"

602
00:41:26,765 --> 00:41:31,841
SAM: No, I didn't, I came to make sure you were
all right, and is everything all right? Have we

603
00:41:31,841 --> 00:41:34,380
heard of any other attacks or incidents?

604
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,683
MATT: "None yet, before you came in and rudely
interrupted my update from Verath over there, but

605
00:41:37,683 --> 00:41:42,563
"it seems that there hasn't been any more activity.
All the hooded ones we've seen have all absconded

606
00:41:42,563 --> 00:41:44,583
"over towards the mountain range again."

607
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:46,071
TALIESIN: Hooded ones?

608
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:54,611
SAM: Yeah, the ones in the mountain, in the cave.
What about buyers? Have we had any new interest?

609
00:41:54,611 --> 00:41:59,346
MATT: "No, not too bad. Carthol's been working
around the clock. I believe he's working on a new

610
00:41:59,346 --> 00:42:07,711
"game set. Something ivory and Issylrian in nature.
Supposed to go for a pretty penny, if we take it

611
00:42:07,711 --> 00:42:11,883
"across over up on Wildmount, but it'll take a
little longer to make it. You know, one-man job.

612
00:42:11,883 --> 00:42:13,633
"He's good. He's not that good."

613
00:42:13,633 --> 00:42:18,269
SAM: Just remind him to put some imperfections in
it. He always likes to make things too beautiful.

614
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,584
MATT: "I will, I will."

615
00:42:19,584 --> 00:42:22,107
LAURA: Why don't you want to sell beautiful
things?

616
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:27,320
SAM: We want to sell real things, not things that
look like they're brand-new. If things are really

617
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,086
old, they have dents and scuffs on them.

618
00:42:30,086 --> 00:42:32,750
JON: Wait, so you're lying again.

619
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:37,695
MATT: "Modifying the presentation."

620
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:40,937
JON: I don't know who to trust anymore.

621
00:42:40,937 --> 00:42:43,168
SAM: You should trust me because I pay you.

622
00:42:43,168 --> 00:42:45,890
MATT: "I don't know. Looks like he might be
growing up."

623
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:49,222
(laughter)

624
00:42:49,222 --> 00:42:51,545
JON: I have been eating more.

625
00:42:51,545 --> 00:42:55,668
MATT: "Oh, I can tell that." (laughs) She sets off
the throne and comes up and leaps and smacks you

626
00:42:55,668 --> 00:42:59,287
on the shoulder. Pretty good hit.

627
00:42:59,287 --> 00:43:01,724
JON: That's awesome!

628
00:43:01,724 --> 00:43:05,880
MATT: "I know. Anyway."

629
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:10,017
SAM: All right, so we'll be gone-- we've rested
recently, right?

630
00:43:10,017 --> 00:43:11,721
MATT: Yeah, the night before.

631
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:18,192
SAM: So we'll be going for a while, and just hold
down the fort while we're gone. Also, I know it

632
00:43:18,192 --> 00:43:26,453
sounds stupid, but can you look into getting a few
ducks? Just as pets?

633
00:43:26,453 --> 00:43:29,456
MATT: "Sure."

634
00:43:29,456 --> 00:43:33,661
SAM: Yeah, I know. It's just a thank-you.

635
00:43:33,661 --> 00:43:35,305
MATT: "Ducks."

636
00:43:35,305 --> 00:43:36,919
SAM: Yes.

637
00:43:36,919 --> 00:43:39,386
JON: They have awesome information.

638
00:43:39,386 --> 00:43:47,956
MATT: "Right, okay. Ducks it is. I'll get right to
it. I'll talk to my duck distributor."

639
00:43:47,956 --> 00:43:52,696
SAM: Just ask, just ask us and that would be fine,
too.

640
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:55,450
JON: Yeah, but ducks will know things that you
don't!

641
00:43:55,450 --> 00:44:01,621
MATT: "I'll send some word to the Fowl District of
Ank'harel to provide the proper--"

642
00:44:01,621 --> 00:44:03,643
MARISHA: There's a fowl district?

643
00:44:03,643 --> 00:44:07,039
MATT: "No, there's not a fowl district! I'm
fucking with you."

644
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:12,635
SAM: You should always assume she's fucking with
you. Every time.

645
00:44:12,635 --> 00:44:15,846
MATT: "You traveled with this one long enough.
Figure it out."

646
00:44:15,846 --> 00:44:17,881
LIAM: Wonder where she gets it from?

647
00:44:17,881 --> 00:44:20,625
MATT: "Don't you say a goddamn thing or I'll cut
your tongue out."

648
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:22,156
LIAM: Promises, promises.

649
00:44:22,156 --> 00:44:30,318
MATT: "All right. Go about your business. I've got
it here. Don't die. Any of you. Especially you.

650
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:33,502
"I've got ducks coming for you, don't know what to
do if you don't show up back here to pick 'em up."

651
00:44:33,502 --> 00:44:34,699
JON: I won't die.

652
00:44:34,699 --> 00:44:36,177
MATT: "Good. Don't."

653
00:44:36,177 --> 00:44:38,951
SAM: If he does, we'll just eat the ducks.

654
00:44:38,951 --> 00:44:41,974
MATT: "I don't care, then. Ducks are pretty
tasty."

655
00:44:41,974 --> 00:44:44,191
JON: They'll tell you where to bury me.

656
00:44:44,191 --> 00:44:47,128
(laughter)

657
00:44:47,128 --> 00:44:48,697
JON: They know all the proper spots.

658
00:44:48,697 --> 00:44:51,953
SAM: Sure. Okay.

659
00:44:51,953 --> 00:44:58,637
MATT: "All right, then, shoo. Night's about to
come. You can travel over the cool evening air."

660
00:44:58,637 --> 00:45:03,005
SAM: Do any of you need any supplies or anything
before we go? Are we good to travel on foot?"

661
00:45:03,005 --> 00:45:05,747
LAURA: What kind of potions you got available?
Healing potions?

662
00:45:05,747 --> 00:45:11,967
SAM: Healing potions? I can heal with my words.
Why would I need healing potions?

663
00:45:11,967 --> 00:45:13,624
LAURA: Just in case you run away.

664
00:45:13,624 --> 00:45:14,926
LIAM: Is that a no?

665
00:45:14,926 --> 00:45:22,672
ASHLEY: Just in case you decide to leave again,
which is probably highly probable. I don't know.

666
00:45:22,672 --> 00:45:23,934
Just in case.

667
00:45:23,934 --> 00:45:33,037
SAM: No, I don't have any of those. But it can be
arranged if you are short. I can have my second

668
00:45:33,037 --> 00:45:34,752
here look into it for you.

669
00:45:34,752 --> 00:45:42,557
LAURA: I have three regular healing potions and
that's it.

670
00:45:42,557 --> 00:45:44,199
TALIESIN: Cleared out.

671
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,799
LAURA: I think we're pretty much out.

672
00:45:46,799 --> 00:45:49,791
SAM: Crutch, will you--

673
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,672
JON: I have 375 grams.

674
00:45:51,672 --> 00:45:52,952
SAM: That's gold.

675
00:45:52,952 --> 00:45:55,578
LAURA: You have 375 grams?

676
00:45:55,578 --> 00:45:56,890
JON: Gold, I guess.

677
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:58,230
LAURA: Grams of gold?

678
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:02,990
JON: They look the same. But I can buy lots of
potions with that, right?

679
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:10,896
SAM: No, you cannot buy any. But the Crutch here
will look into it while we're gone. We won't have

680
00:46:10,896 --> 00:46:12,918
any until we get back, though.

681
00:46:12,918 --> 00:46:17,507
TRAVIS: He calls you the Crutch?

682
00:46:17,507 --> 00:46:22,266
MATT: "The Crutch is my work name. It's what the
Meat Man calls me 'cause of my height."

683
00:46:22,266 --> 00:46:25,941
LAURA: Oh. I see.

684
00:46:25,941 --> 00:46:35,523
TALIESIN: So it's a name for when he's ribbing
you. Ribbing. I'm just so excited by all the puns

685
00:46:35,523 --> 00:46:37,105
that are available.

686
00:46:37,105 --> 00:46:42,036
LAURA: So no healing, then? Let's just go?

687
00:46:42,036 --> 00:46:43,842
SAM: No, we have to just go.

688
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:49,732
MATT: "Hold on, hold on." She walks over and
starts rummaging through a few small crates that

689
00:46:49,732 --> 00:46:54,563
are to the side. She's like, "These haven't been
organized properly." Grabs a little crowbar and

690
00:46:54,563 --> 00:46:59,634
wedges it in. Pops off the top, starts rummaging
through, tossing various things out the side like

691
00:46:59,634 --> 00:47:07,327
small metal cups roll across the ground, come to a
stop. Pulls out a small, looks like a leather

692
00:47:07,327 --> 00:47:14,537
satchel of some kind that's wrapped over the top
and the side with twine. Unwraps it. "There's a

693
00:47:14,537 --> 00:47:27,446
"few something for you." Sets it down. Pulls a
necklace off. "You're borrowing this, but you're

694
00:47:27,446 --> 00:47:29,411
"bringing it back when you're done."

695
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:31,625
SAM: Of course.

696
00:47:31,625 --> 00:47:34,832
MATT: "All right. Now, which one of you but him
wants it?"

697
00:47:34,832 --> 00:47:36,209
JON: Oh, I do, I do!

698
00:47:36,209 --> 00:47:37,899
MATT: "Okay." Throws it to you.

699
00:47:37,899 --> 00:47:40,329
JON: It's really cool-looking.

700
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:48,093
MATT: It's a heavy, somewhat tarnished silver
chain that smells of old ale-stained wood.

701
00:47:48,093 --> 00:47:50,109
JON: Oh, I don't like it, someone else take it.

702
00:47:50,109 --> 00:47:52,456
LAURA: No, no, no, I called it.

703
00:47:52,456 --> 00:47:55,753
LIAM: Give it to me, give it to me, I called it as
well! Dad, make us roll for it.

704
00:47:55,753 --> 00:47:57,848
JON: Why don't you guys just cut it in half?

705
00:47:57,848 --> 00:47:59,312
LAURA: Tickle-tickle-tickle!

706
00:47:59,312 --> 00:48:01,421
MATT: Both of you guys make strength checks.

707
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:05,160
LAURA: But I don't wanna break it! Don't pull so
hard that you break it!

708
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:11,536
LIAM: Why would I do that? I have so much finesse.
That's cocked. It was cocked, you say cocked

709
00:48:11,536 --> 00:48:14,212
eighty thousand times, and now I'm gonna use Luck,
because I wanna beat you.

710
00:48:14,212 --> 00:48:15,776
LAURA: You motherfuck!

711
00:48:15,776 --> 00:48:17,692
LIAM: Oh, it's the same thing! So what is this,
strength?

712
00:48:17,692 --> 00:48:19,242
MATT: Strength, add the strength modifier.

713
00:48:19,242 --> 00:48:20,568
LIAM: I will.

714
00:48:20,568 --> 00:48:21,766
LAURA: Oh, no.

715
00:48:21,766 --> 00:48:23,112
LIAM: You go first.

716
00:48:23,112 --> 00:48:23,958
LAURA: Nine.

717
00:48:23,958 --> 00:48:25,062
LIAM: Oh, she beat me!

718
00:48:25,062 --> 00:48:26,808
(laughter)

719
00:48:26,808 --> 00:48:28,313
MATT: You rip the chain from his grip.

720
00:48:28,313 --> 00:48:32,284
LAURA: What did I get? What is it?

721
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:34,450
MATT: "It's an Amulet of the Drunkard."

722
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:36,435
LAURA: What's that mean?

723
00:48:36,435 --> 00:48:40,450
MATT: "You wear that, you drink yourself some fine,
fine alcohol, might heal you a bit."

724
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:46,453
LAURA: Do you already wear a necklace? I already
wear a necklace, so I probably can't wear it, huh?

725
00:48:46,453 --> 00:48:51,731
You can get up. It's okay, you can go. You've got
30 feet!

726
00:48:51,731 --> 00:48:53,760
SAM: Jack off, jack off, jack off!

727
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,563
MATT: The umbilical! There you go.

728
00:48:56,563 --> 00:48:58,273
MARISHA: You're good, you're good.

729
00:48:58,273 --> 00:49:04,670
TALIESIN: It turns spirits into potions. That's
pretty solid.

730
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:10,296
TRAVIS: Beer, ale, mead, or wine will cause you to
regain 2d4 + 2 hit points.

731
00:49:10,296 --> 00:49:13,855
LAURA: Oh jeez, that's so cool. Do you already
wear a necklace, Grog?

732
00:49:13,855 --> 00:49:16,630
Do you have to attune to it?

733
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:21,420
MATT: It is not attuned. But there is a limit to
it, if you read it.

734
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,853
TRAVIS: Yeah, you can only once until the next
dawn.

735
00:49:23,853 --> 00:49:27,049
MATT: So once a day, you can just drink a pint of
some alcoholic drink, and it'll heal you like a

736
00:49:27,049 --> 00:49:28,461
basic healing potion.

737
00:49:28,461 --> 00:49:29,720
TRAVIS: Fucking awesome.

738
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,893
MARISHA: Who was out of healing potions?

739
00:49:31,893 --> 00:49:33,077
TALIESIN: I'm out.

740
00:49:33,077 --> 00:49:36,190
LAURA: I've got three for the party, it's not for
me. I have none for myself.

741
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:41,192
SAM: I know I've been rather quiet this journey,
but I could just provide us with a few more, if

742
00:49:41,192 --> 00:49:42,595
that would help things--

743
00:49:42,595 --> 00:49:44,997
TRAVIS: Tary, that is very considerate of you,
yeah.

744
00:49:44,997 --> 00:49:46,444
JON: Is this Taryon?

745
00:49:46,444 --> 00:49:54,404
SAM: Yeah, sorry, it's odd for me. I will rip off
my last remaining potion patch on the robe, which

746
00:49:54,404 --> 00:49:56,694
has four small healing potions.

747
00:49:56,694 --> 00:50:02,806
MATT: There you go, so you have-- and the satchel
that you received from the Crutch has three more

748
00:50:02,806 --> 00:50:04,204
additional regular healing potions.

749
00:50:04,204 --> 00:50:07,193
SAM: So we have seven regular healing potions.

750
00:50:07,193 --> 00:50:10,064
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. So everybody take one?

751
00:50:10,064 --> 00:50:11,644
MARISHA: I have four on me.

752
00:50:11,644 --> 00:50:13,484
LAURA: Oh, jeez. Everybody but Keyleth take one?

753
00:50:13,484 --> 00:50:17,198
MARISHA: I made a few over the break, if we want
them.

754
00:50:17,198 --> 00:50:20,731
TALIESIN: Well, as long as I've gone one in
there.

755
00:50:20,731 --> 00:50:22,541
MARISHA: I'm gonna hand another one to Percy.

756
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:23,718
TALIESIN: I'll take two.

757
00:50:23,718 --> 00:50:26,466
LIAM: Hey, T., are you feeling sentimental, being
back in Marquet?

758
00:50:26,466 --> 00:50:32,279
SAM: The weather is certainly dry.

759
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,788
LIAM: You've come full circle.

760
00:50:33,788 --> 00:50:41,766
SAM: Yes. I certainly have. It's good to be back,
but I'm a little nervous.

761
00:50:41,766 --> 00:50:43,563
I don't know why, really.

762
00:50:43,563 --> 00:50:45,644
LIAM: New setting.

763
00:50:45,644 --> 00:50:48,064
SAM: Yes. New dynamic.

764
00:50:48,064 --> 00:50:50,566
TRAVIS: Your hair's holding up well in the heat,
though.

765
00:50:50,566 --> 00:50:53,961
SAM: Only because it's under the Helm. Believe me,
it's a nightmare in there if you look underneath.

766
00:50:53,961 --> 00:50:56,686
ASHLEY: I'm sure you look beautiful.

767
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,576
LIAM: Does it retain the shape of the helmet?

768
00:50:58,576 --> 00:51:02,298
SAM: Unfortunately, yes.

769
00:51:02,298 --> 00:51:04,660
(laughter)

770
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:12,101
LAURA: I'm just holding this necklace. I have a
necklace on, I can't wear it.

771
00:51:12,101 --> 00:51:14,571
JON: I thought you were giving it to him.

772
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,467
LAURA: Can you wear it?

773
00:51:16,467 --> 00:51:18,460
JON: To Gog over there.

774
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:21,019
LIAM: No, I'm not wearing a necklace.

775
00:51:21,019 --> 00:51:25,085
LAURA: Well then, let me give it to you.

776
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:27,255
LIAM: I didn't actually want it. I just wanted to
best you.

777
00:51:27,255 --> 00:51:28,541
LAURA: Well, now you have it.

778
00:51:28,541 --> 00:51:29,838
TALIESIN: You can actually use it, though.

779
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:31,151
LIAM: Can I have the thingie?

780
00:51:31,151 --> 00:51:32,739
TRAVIS: You're not giving it to me?

781
00:51:32,739 --> 00:51:34,938
LAURA: I thought you said you already wore a
necklace!

782
00:51:34,938 --> 00:51:40,314
TRAVIS: No. No! I mean, I wear, like, ears and
fingers and toes around my neck, but you can

783
00:51:40,314 --> 00:51:46,208
always accessorize some more, fuck, shit! I'm the
only one that walks around with alcohol on me all

784
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:47,559
the time, anyway.

785
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:53,475
MARISHA: So wait, can he combo-use that and be
like fine wine and chug it?

786
00:51:53,475 --> 00:51:58,201
MATT: Any relatively alcoholic drink labeled on
the thing, he can drink a pint of.

787
00:51:58,201 --> 00:52:05,150
LIAM: A pint, though, Grog? A pint? You'd snort
that up your left nostril, right?

788
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:09,498
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's like a little traveler's bottle
of soap.

789
00:52:09,498 --> 00:52:12,302
LIAM: Yeah, that's like you sneezing into a
bottle.

790
00:52:12,302 --> 00:52:17,721
JON: Do you have an extra necklace that turns
chocolate milk into, like, healing?

791
00:52:17,721 --> 00:52:21,388
MATT: "I'll put the word out for you. See what we
can find."

792
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:24,373
LAURA: Are we heading out immediately?

793
00:52:24,373 --> 00:52:26,037
SAM: There's nothing to wait for.

794
00:52:26,037 --> 00:52:28,599
MARISHA: I actually do have a necklace. I have an
old necklace.

795
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:30,266
SAM: What are we talking about now?

796
00:52:30,266 --> 00:52:36,806
JON: Everybody went from no potions to, well, I've
got this, I've got this.

797
00:52:36,806 --> 00:52:41,803
LAURA: I don't know why I asked for potions when
we had four fucking potions.

798
00:52:41,803 --> 00:52:44,071
TALIESIN: It might be that thing that I got rid
of.

799
00:52:44,071 --> 00:52:48,751
MARISHA: I had an old card that was the necklace
that gave +1 to attack and damage while--

800
00:52:48,751 --> 00:52:54,467
SAM: That's an attunement item. We don't need that
shit. Let's go.

801
00:52:54,467 --> 00:53:01,487
MARISHA: All right. Sorry your employer overruled
me, Kord. Or Card. Or Chode.

802
00:53:01,487 --> 00:53:02,604
LAURA: Lionel.

803
00:53:02,604 --> 00:53:10,483
MATT: "All right. Please. Out of my space." And
you watch as her form shifts back to that of Aes

804
00:53:10,483 --> 00:53:11,841
Adan, the Meat Man.

805
00:53:11,841 --> 00:53:13,321
TRAVIS: That's impressive.

806
00:53:13,321 --> 00:53:17,149
MATT: "Thank you. Treat that well. If you lose it,
I'm making you pay for it!"

807
00:53:17,149 --> 00:53:18,747
TRAVIS: Oh, no, it's in good hands.

808
00:53:18,747 --> 00:53:22,131
MATT: "All right, then. Good luck! Don't die."

809
00:53:22,131 --> 00:53:24,236
LAURA: The Crutch.

810
00:53:24,236 --> 00:53:28,153
MATT: "I'm the Meat Man now."

811
00:53:28,153 --> 00:53:30,925
TRAVIS: Yeah, she changed back.

812
00:53:30,925 --> 00:53:33,633
LAURA: Sorry, I was looking at necklaces.

813
00:53:33,633 --> 00:53:35,816
SAM: All right. On we go.

814
00:53:35,816 --> 00:53:39,509
TRAVIS: Yeah. We head back out the cramped little
tunnel.

815
00:53:39,509 --> 00:53:45,005
MATT: All right. Make your way back up through the
tobacco shop to the streets of Ank'harel. You are

816
00:53:45,005 --> 00:53:49,919
aware that the Smouldercrown mountain range is
about 290 miles

817
00:53:49,919 --> 00:53:51,785
southeast of Ank'harel across the desert.

818
00:53:51,785 --> 00:54:01,713
JON: You guys, it's gonna be a really long hike,
so let's find another burning tree, or Sun Tree or

819
00:54:01,713 --> 00:54:06,138
something that we can just walk into. 'Cause that
was way easier than traveling.

820
00:54:06,138 --> 00:54:07,684
TALIESIN: Misty Step.

821
00:54:07,684 --> 00:54:11,544
LAURA: Not Misty Step. Wind Walk.

822
00:54:11,544 --> 00:54:14,196
TRAVIS: You can do the tree thing too?

823
00:54:14,196 --> 00:54:17,654
JON: No, I've never seen that. I can show you how
to get there, but it seems--

824
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:19,453
TRAVIS: Have you ever tried?

825
00:54:19,453 --> 00:54:22,368
JON: Tried through the Sun Tree? What do I do? Do
I just--

826
00:54:22,368 --> 00:54:25,390
LAURA: You have to ask him.

827
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:28,294
JON: I'm good at-- okay.

828
00:54:28,294 --> 00:54:29,954
LIAM: Absolute conviction.

829
00:54:29,954 --> 00:54:31,823
JON: So I go over to the nearest tree.

830
00:54:31,823 --> 00:54:33,975
MATT: Okay. About maybe one block up, there's--

831
00:54:33,975 --> 00:54:35,282
JON: About one block, guys, come on. Leading the
way.

832
00:54:35,282 --> 00:54:37,423
MATT: All right. Solid trunk palm.

833
00:54:37,423 --> 00:54:43,143
MARISHA: He likes it when you're super chill and
casual with him, so be cool.

834
00:54:43,143 --> 00:54:45,495
JON: He? So the trees are like dudes?

835
00:54:45,495 --> 00:54:47,135
LAURA: All of them?

836
00:54:47,135 --> 00:54:50,464
MARISHA: (mouths) Just go with it.

837
00:54:50,464 --> 00:54:53,544
JON: He likes it when you're what?

838
00:54:53,544 --> 00:54:55,235
TALIESIN: Chill and casual.

839
00:54:55,235 --> 00:55:07,407
JON: Oh. Okay. So I go up to the tree. Do I touch
it? You're the tree. Hey, can you open up and take

840
00:55:07,407 --> 00:55:17,024
us to Crown-- what was it? Smouldercrown entrance,
just 'cause. Wait, it would be way easier to just

841
00:55:17,024 --> 00:55:18,556
go straight to the pyramid.

842
00:55:18,556 --> 00:55:21,568
LIAM: Yeah, but it's more like a stroking thing.
You don't just leave your hand in place.

843
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:29,288
JON: Okay, so hey, I'm chill. Can you just take
us? Be cool?

844
00:55:29,288 --> 00:55:34,332
TRAVIS: The bark's a little dry. Maybe it needs a
little moisture. There you go.

845
00:55:34,332 --> 00:55:38,173
SAM: (screams)

846
00:55:38,173 --> 00:55:48,000
JON: So yeah, it's cool, we're cool, if you want
to take us there. If not, we get it. Is that

847
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,153
pretty chill?

848
00:55:49,153 --> 00:55:50,841
MARISHA: That's pretty chill, yeah.

849
00:55:50,841 --> 00:55:53,417
LAURA: I'm surprised it's not working, honestly.
That's the most chill I've ever seen.

850
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:54,957
SAM: Why am I playing the tree?

851
00:55:54,957 --> 00:55:56,437
JON: Are you guys--

852
00:55:56,437 --> 00:56:03,367
MARISHA: You know that intimate hug we had
earlier? Kinda do that.

853
00:56:03,367 --> 00:56:07,564
JON: Aes? Now I'm talking to Aes.

854
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:09,130
SAM: Oh, okay. Yes.

855
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:16,086
JON: This reminds me of times when I was a kid and
kids would-- are they making fun of me?

856
00:56:16,086 --> 00:56:18,340
SAM: They are definitely making fun of you.

857
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,526
JON: Oh, come on!

858
00:56:19,526 --> 00:56:22,193
LIAM: What're you telling him lies for?

859
00:56:22,193 --> 00:56:23,990
TALIESIN: We do this to everybody. It's all
right.

860
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:25,182
JON: You do?

861
00:56:25,182 --> 00:56:27,109
MARISHA: It's part of the initiation.

862
00:56:27,109 --> 00:56:28,752
TALIESIN: But yes, we are making fun of you.

863
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:32,158
JON: Sorry, tree. Wait, are the trees really
alive?

864
00:56:32,158 --> 00:56:33,338
LAURA: No, they are.

865
00:56:33,338 --> 00:56:36,512
JON: Okay, sorry, tree. But that was kinda fun,
stroking it.

866
00:56:36,512 --> 00:56:38,537
MARISHA: The tree appreciates it.

867
00:56:38,537 --> 00:56:42,295
JON: Anyways, why don't you guys just do the Sun
Tree thing?

868
00:56:42,295 --> 00:56:47,570
SAM: We can't really do that. We need to know
where the tree is

869
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,956
that we're going to be going to.

870
00:56:49,956 --> 00:56:52,538
LIAM: There's a lot of tree science involved.

871
00:56:52,538 --> 00:56:56,184
MARISHA: If you could maybe potentially help me,
Meat Man.

872
00:56:56,184 --> 00:56:59,673
SAM: I haven't been there, have I?

873
00:56:59,673 --> 00:57:02,692
MATT: You haven't been to Smouldercrown, no.

874
00:57:02,692 --> 00:57:05,818
MARISHA: Why were you just talking like the Meat
Man?

875
00:57:05,818 --> 00:57:11,158
SAM: I have not been to the place we are going. I
do not know of any tree.

876
00:57:11,158 --> 00:57:13,075
MATT: Yeah, the only one who's been there is
Lionel.

877
00:57:13,075 --> 00:57:14,290
MARISHA: You've been there.

878
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:17,179
JON: Yeah, I'm the one who saw it and told you
guys about it.

879
00:57:17,179 --> 00:57:18,271
MARISHA: Were there trees?

880
00:57:18,271 --> 00:57:22,545
JON: Yeah, there were a couple dead-looking trees,
not huge ones. How big do they have to be?

881
00:57:22,545 --> 00:57:23,892
MARISHA: They looked dead?

882
00:57:23,892 --> 00:57:25,563
JON: They looked a little dead-ish.

883
00:57:25,563 --> 00:57:28,024
MARISHA: They were dead? Like very dead?

884
00:57:28,024 --> 00:57:29,904
JON: Do they have to be alive?

885
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:34,423
MARISHA: I think so? Right?

886
00:57:34,423 --> 00:57:36,692
JON: I really wanted to see that Sun Tree thing.

887
00:57:36,692 --> 00:57:38,410
TRAVIS: We'll use it to go back.

888
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:40,580
MARISHA: Would you prefer to be a cloud?

889
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:42,433
JON: I can be a cloud?

890
00:57:42,433 --> 00:57:46,095
MARISHA: I could be a cloud, but I'm gonna blow a
7th-level spell for it.

891
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:48,479
LAURA: Wait, but how many people can you do,
because we also have Doty.

892
00:57:48,479 --> 00:57:52,387
MARISHA: Ten? Let me see.

893
00:57:52,387 --> 00:57:58,482
LIAM: Can you turn an automaton, a robit, into
cloud? Did we do that already?

894
00:57:58,482 --> 00:58:00,639
SAM: Not too many. We're ten exactly.

895
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:01,899
TRAVIS: Really?

896
00:58:01,899 --> 00:58:03,357
LAURA: Yeah, Trinket's in the necklace.

897
00:58:03,357 --> 00:58:05,397
TRAVIS: Doty, Taryon, Scanlan.

898
00:58:05,397 --> 00:58:07,047
LAURA: Oh, shit. Taryon and Scanlan.

899
00:58:07,047 --> 00:58:08,794
SAM: That's ten, isn't it?

900
00:58:08,794 --> 00:58:16,746
ASHLEY: But that's blowing a 7th-level spell. How
long does it take to hike up there?

901
00:58:16,746 --> 00:58:18,258
SAM: 290 miles.

902
00:58:18,258 --> 00:58:21,673
MATT: Wind Walk is a 6th-level spell. Not a 7th.

903
00:58:21,673 --> 00:58:26,689
MARISHA: But I've already used my 6th-level spell
to Transport Via Plants. That's what I'm saying.

904
00:58:26,689 --> 00:58:29,302
So I'm gonna have to use a 7th-level spell to do
it.

905
00:58:29,302 --> 00:58:30,754
MATT: This is true.

906
00:58:30,754 --> 00:58:32,095
TRAVIS: It's worth it.

907
00:58:32,095 --> 00:58:33,956
LIAM: Does that work on Doty?

908
00:58:33,956 --> 00:58:37,029
MATT: So you'd be able to get all of you.

909
00:58:37,029 --> 00:58:39,095
TALIESIN: Would it work on Doty?

910
00:58:39,095 --> 00:58:46,769
MATT: Willing creatures. Technically he's
considered a creature for the targeting reason of

911
00:58:46,769 --> 00:58:48,095
spells and effects, so yeah.

912
00:58:48,095 --> 00:58:49,585
LIAM: Tary.

913
00:58:49,585 --> 00:58:58,787
MARISHA: So we can do that, but then we might
wanna rest. Or we can do some scouting, take a

914
00:58:58,787 --> 00:59:01,714
look. I won't be completely tapped out.

915
00:59:01,714 --> 00:59:03,864
LIAM: We can camp it up if we need to.

916
00:59:03,864 --> 00:59:08,148
TALIESIN: It'll take more than a day to get there
anyway, so this way we'll just save some time and

917
00:59:08,148 --> 00:59:10,675
we'll take a day to take a look around.

918
00:59:10,675 --> 00:59:12,669
LAURA: Let's go!

919
00:59:12,669 --> 00:59:17,024
LIAM: Lionel, this is really awesome. For real,
you're going to like this.

920
00:59:17,024 --> 00:59:19,478
MARISHA: Ready? Ready? Everybody join hands, join
hands, join hands.

921
00:59:19,478 --> 00:59:20,961
LAURA: Do we have to join hands for this?

922
00:59:20,961 --> 00:59:22,646
SAM: We don't at all. Not at all.

923
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:24,285
JON: Can we still do it?

924
00:59:24,285 --> 00:59:26,902
MARISHA: Poof!

925
00:59:26,902 --> 00:59:31,435
MATT: All right, you guys feel a warm, magical
effect go through you. As you're concentrating,

926
00:59:31,435 --> 00:59:36,754
consider yourself being a cloud, you are the
cloud. You open your eyes, Lionel, and you look,

927
00:59:36,754 --> 00:59:40,240
and you are a fucking cloud! You're like 20 feet
up!

928
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,896
JON: Oh, check this out! (spits)

929
00:59:42,896 --> 00:59:47,713
MATT: As you do that, you watch as more cloud spit
goes (fft) and just more cloud. Your body is

930
00:59:47,713 --> 00:59:50,575
moisture. When you try and talk, it just goes
(exhale).

931
00:59:50,575 --> 00:59:53,621
JON: So you can't really talk.

932
00:59:53,621 --> 01:00:00,627
MATT: Can't really talk. You're a cloud. So if you
wanted to, you could spend a minute to concentrate

933
01:00:00,627 --> 01:00:04,419
and revert back, and you can do that-- you have an
eight-hour period where

934
01:00:04,419 --> 01:00:05,935
you can just turn back and forth.

935
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:10,457
LAURA: We should probably concentrate for just a
minute. I'm gonna turn back, just so I can shout

936
01:00:10,457 --> 01:00:16,666
out, we should all follow-- you know how to get
there, right, Lionel?

937
01:00:16,666 --> 01:00:20,088
JON: (wind noises)

938
01:00:20,088 --> 01:00:29,619
LAURA: Bob up and down if it's a yes. Okay. We're
going to follow you, all right? And when it's

939
01:00:29,619 --> 01:00:36,087
ready to land, then just hover down, and we'll all
follow your lead.

940
01:00:36,087 --> 01:00:38,458
JON: (fart sound)

941
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:41,763
(laughter)

942
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:45,389
LAURA: That's totally normal. We all do it. All
right.

943
01:00:45,389 --> 01:00:50,905
MATT: All right. So you all go into your mist
forms and begin to follow after Lionel's lead. As

944
01:00:50,905 --> 01:00:56,740
you guys coast over the upper areas of Ank'harel,
it's a beautiful view looking down at this

945
01:00:56,740 --> 01:01:03,315
gorgeous city, just this glittering jewel of color
and architecture, one of the older cities in

946
01:01:03,315 --> 01:01:11,967
Exandria that portions of it seem to have survived
elements of the Age of Arcanum and the Calamity,

947
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:19,340
and one of the first societies to spring up
thereafter. And it's beautiful to see this

948
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:23,898
history, far longer than that of Tal'Dorei, or at
least the human societies of Tal'Dorei, just

949
01:01:23,898 --> 01:01:30,420
standing obstinate against the dark oppression of
the surrounding desert. You continue to head in

950
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:33,049
that direction, with you leading. Lionel, I need
you to roll a survival check.

951
01:01:33,049 --> 01:01:38,619
LAURA: Survival check. We might get lost?

952
01:01:38,619 --> 01:01:40,769
TALIESIN: Add that to your survival.

953
01:01:40,769 --> 01:01:43,317
JON: 14.

954
01:01:43,317 --> 01:01:50,124
MATT: 14. All right. So you're traveling at an
incredible speed. Like you're used to walking

955
01:01:50,124 --> 01:01:56,567
speed, running speed sometimes, maybe horsey
speed. This is a very, very fast speed. You're

956
01:01:56,567 --> 01:02:03,502
coasting through the air right as the sun begins
to set, and the night begins to hit. You keep

957
01:02:03,502 --> 01:02:08,575
relatively low to the ground, so you have your
Darkvision to see the topography and get an idea

958
01:02:08,575 --> 01:02:12,575
of where it's going and the direction. You can
look up and see the stars above. You've traveled,

959
01:02:12,575 --> 01:02:15,423
and you've been amongst this desert most of your
life, so you have a good sense of how to follow

960
01:02:15,423 --> 01:02:19,913
that, and because of that, you're able to maintain
your directional position towards the

961
01:02:19,913 --> 01:02:24,295
Smouldercrown Mountains. You push on. About
halfway through the journey, you can see some

962
01:02:24,295 --> 01:02:28,429
little flames occasionally in the distance, what
looks to be either caravan camps or bandit camps

963
01:02:28,429 --> 01:02:33,036
or various nomad circles that are set up for the
night where different campfires are placed,

964
01:02:33,036 --> 01:02:37,927
whether it's beacons, traps, or just people to
stay warm for the evening. You know, best not to

965
01:02:37,927 --> 01:02:42,787
stop whenever you see a flame in the middle of the
desert. The winds are picking up and getting

966
01:02:42,787 --> 01:02:47,693
colder, the stark contrast between the temperature
of the day and the night here is immense, and your

967
01:02:47,693 --> 01:02:52,688
moisture form takes on the cold fairly quickly,
and you feel, even though you're in this form, the

968
01:02:52,688 --> 01:02:56,415
chill still captures you a bit as your
condensation begins to slightly crystallize in

969
01:02:56,415 --> 01:02:59,201
places, but you push on. Roll one more survival
check, please.

970
01:02:59,201 --> 01:03:02,297
LAURA: Don't get us lost!

971
01:03:02,297 --> 01:03:04,166
JON: 15.

972
01:03:04,166 --> 01:03:11,619
MATT: 15. And without an issue or any sort of a
loss of step or position, eventually you watch as

973
01:03:11,619 --> 01:03:17,970
the ominous spire-like jagged dagger-topped
Smouldercrown Mountains begin to break the horizon

974
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:23,585
and make their way towards you. You're now, at
that speed, it hasn't been that long since you

975
01:03:23,585 --> 01:03:29,178
left, maybe a few hours out of Ank'harel. So
you're maybe around ten o'clock in the evening or

976
01:03:29,178 --> 01:03:34,088
so, 10:30. Going to go ahead and move over here to
a non--

977
01:03:34,088 --> 01:03:37,046
TALIESIN: I was gonna argue that since he has the
Duck Totem, that technically he would have a

978
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:39,554
natural migration sense of what direction he was
gonna go.

979
01:03:39,554 --> 01:03:42,679
MATT: That's a good argument to make, but not
necessary, but good for holding on to that.

980
01:03:42,679 --> 01:03:46,161
TALIESIN: Yeah, just thought I'd put that out
there. I feel like his duck sense would be

981
01:03:46,161 --> 01:03:48,563
tingling. Always knows where South is.

982
01:03:48,563 --> 01:03:50,753
MATT: Not denying. Recognized, but unnecessary in
the moment.

983
01:03:50,753 --> 01:03:52,385
TALIESIN: Unnecessary, but worth noting.

984
01:03:52,385 --> 01:03:59,776
MATT: Worth noting, indeed. But yeah. So the
spires of the mountain are surprisingly steep.

985
01:03:59,776 --> 01:04:04,417
They're steeple-like, almost, in a lot of places.
They're all just jutting up like these gargantuan

986
01:04:04,417 --> 01:04:09,967
spikes that were pressed out of the earth from
some sort of landmass shift or some volcanic

987
01:04:09,967 --> 01:04:16,782
activity long, long ago. But you can see the
densely packed rock formations, and the mountain

988
01:04:16,782 --> 01:04:27,285
cluster is maybe, at most, I'll say three miles,
four miles across. It's not a very, very big

989
01:04:27,285 --> 01:04:33,141
mountain range. And it's called Smouldercrown
because the circular pattern of the oval-like

990
01:04:33,141 --> 01:04:38,143
pattern of the mountains that rise up and
resembles at a distance like a king's crown in the

991
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:44,019
way that it circles around itself. You recall one
of three different entrances, the one that was

992
01:04:44,019 --> 01:04:48,896
safest that you guys took when you entered, the
central portion of the mountain range from the

993
01:04:48,896 --> 01:04:52,898
outside, and you guide the rest of them to the
exterior of this space. You can see it's a small

994
01:04:52,898 --> 01:04:57,576
valley between two of the exterior mountains that
collide together, and there is a valley path,

995
01:04:57,576 --> 01:05:05,292
where you see a number of dried trees. Some do
appear to be alive, Keyleth, though they're

996
01:05:05,292 --> 01:05:12,552
designed to weather extreme droughts. They seem to
have some sort of weird fruit that they're

997
01:05:12,552 --> 01:05:19,724
bearing, dripping off some of the branches, but
the leaves themselves are brown and withered and

998
01:05:19,724 --> 01:05:24,284
you haven't quite seen plant la-life-- plant life
like this before.

999
01:05:24,284 --> 01:05:25,587
LAURA: Plant la-la-la.

1000
01:05:25,587 --> 01:05:27,142
MATT: Plant la-va-la-fl.

1001
01:05:27,142 --> 01:05:29,673
MARISHA: Does it look like it's natural decay?

1002
01:05:29,673 --> 01:05:33,662
MATT: If you want to go and approach it and
inspect it, you can.

1003
01:05:33,662 --> 01:05:36,254
MARISHA: How far-- we're still clouds?

1004
01:05:36,254 --> 01:05:40,087
MATT: You guys are maybe 100 feet up or so, and
you've just now hit the edge of the Smouldercrown

1005
01:05:40,087 --> 01:05:41,458
mountain range.

1006
01:05:41,458 --> 01:05:43,181
MARISHA: Starting to go into the entrance.

1007
01:05:43,181 --> 01:05:46,975
MATT: Yes. The entrance of the mountains. You
haven't found an entrance to the actual mountain

1008
01:05:46,975 --> 01:05:48,656
rock itself.

1009
01:05:48,656 --> 01:05:50,366
MARISHA: Are we going to go on foot from here?

1010
01:05:50,366 --> 01:05:51,739
MATT: That's up to you guys.

1011
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:53,631
TALIESIN: I think we'll get a little closer.

1012
01:05:53,631 --> 01:06:01,028
MARISHA: I'll wait 'til we get closer. From up
here, does the mountain formation look like it's

1013
01:06:01,028 --> 01:06:08,161
naturally formed, or like some sort of other
event? Is it seismically formed?

1014
01:06:08,161 --> 01:06:09,503
MATT: Make a nature check.

1015
01:06:09,503 --> 01:06:20,401
MARISHA: Oh, not good. What's my nature? Okay,
16.

1016
01:06:20,401 --> 01:06:28,824
MATT: 16, not bad. They appear to be seismically
formed. You can see some of the rocks, the way

1017
01:06:28,824 --> 01:06:32,413
they rise up in the smaller areas, are at an angle
where it's smooth on one side, and you can see the

1018
01:06:32,413 --> 01:06:37,310
layers beneath where portions of the earth seem to
have been jammed, cracked, and pushed upward. But

1019
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:42,506
because it's so localized, it isn't like there's
tectonic plates shifting or anything, it's not a

1020
01:06:42,506 --> 01:06:48,267
mass range. Most mountain ranges are long, driven
locations that mark where those various boundaries

1021
01:06:48,267 --> 01:06:53,569
are. This is just a central formation, so you're
uncertain as to what the nature of this creation

1022
01:06:53,569 --> 01:06:55,490
was, but it seems natural.

1023
01:06:55,490 --> 01:07:00,004
LAURA: I'm picturing beautiful Bob Ross mountains.
Just lightly touch.

1024
01:07:00,004 --> 01:07:02,349
MARISHA: Happy accidents.

1025
01:07:02,349 --> 01:07:04,242
TALIESIN: Happy little TPK.

1026
01:07:04,242 --> 01:07:09,885
MATT: Yeah. Percy, can I have you roll a
perception check, please?

1027
01:07:09,885 --> 01:07:16,971
TALIESIN: Yes. I'm not gonna roll that, 'cause
you've been-- I feel like that's yours. It landed

1028
01:07:16,971 --> 01:07:21,946
on other dice. I'm gonna let it be there, though.
Actually, yeah, it's 20.

1029
01:07:21,946 --> 01:07:30,458
MATT: Okay. You, Mr. Human, with no actual
Darkvision, do not get lost on the path. Taryon,

1030
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:32,833
could I have you also roll a perception check?

1031
01:07:32,833 --> 01:07:40,560
SAM: 15 plus something. Minus one. 14.

1032
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:44,695
MATT: Okay, so you fall a little behind the
group.

1033
01:07:44,695 --> 01:07:47,654
SAM: Doty has low-light vision, I think.

1034
01:07:47,654 --> 01:07:57,521
MATT: Doty has Darkvision. We'll say that Doty
manages to get you caught up a little bit. You

1035
01:07:57,521 --> 01:08:00,564
fall a bit behind, but you do manage to find the
rest of the team. You don't get terribly lost in

1036
01:08:00,564 --> 01:08:05,335
the middle of the dark, desert sky of these small
wisps of cloud with no light other than starlight

1037
01:08:05,335 --> 01:08:10,884
there to guide your path forward. They begin to
just pull ahead and vanish into the horizon. You

1038
01:08:10,884 --> 01:08:15,819
freak out but Doty eventually finds you as a cloud
and you swear you hear the wind go, "Tary."

1039
01:08:15,819 --> 01:08:18,071
(laughter)

1040
01:08:18,071 --> 01:08:21,247
MATT: You continue to push forward, eventually
leading into the outside of this entrance of

1041
01:08:21,247 --> 01:08:25,961
Smouldercrown, where the rest of them have
gathered. You guys begin to slowly push into the

1042
01:08:25,961 --> 01:08:32,265
valley that makes its way towards the center of
Smouldercrown, following Lionel's leads. These

1043
01:08:32,265 --> 01:08:39,652
trees that you notice, Keyleth, they're sporadic
in places, and there is scrub brush, sparse, there

1044
01:08:39,652 --> 01:08:43,173
are areas of the ground where it's dried and
cracked. The badlands here, the sands of the

1045
01:08:43,173 --> 01:08:47,695
deserts, the big storms largely don't make it into
the center of the valley because the mountains

1046
01:08:47,695 --> 01:08:50,672
protect it. While there are elements of it here
and there, you can see the

1047
01:08:50,672 --> 01:08:57,918
topography and the landscape here is very dried,
cracked, red earth. Little moisture seems to be

1048
01:08:57,918 --> 01:09:02,453
contained here. The plant life that exists here is
designed to subsist on very, very little water.

1049
01:09:02,453 --> 01:09:10,723
You eventually come, Lionel, to the area where you
believe you found the last entrance. Make an

1050
01:09:10,723 --> 01:09:15,735
investigation check, if you don't mind.

1051
01:09:15,735 --> 01:09:18,258
JON: 21.

1052
01:09:18,258 --> 01:09:25,310
MATT: 21, okay then. You very quickly look around
and recall some of the landmarks.

1053
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:26,758
JON: I'm still in cloud form.

1054
01:09:26,758 --> 01:09:31,784
MATT: You're still in cloud form. But you see some
of the landmarks that seem to triangulate where

1055
01:09:31,784 --> 01:09:35,599
you originally found the entrance. However, to
truly search in this area, you'd have to get low

1056
01:09:35,599 --> 01:09:43,246
and probably go to your physical form to seek it
out. All right, so. You take a minute to

1057
01:09:43,246 --> 01:09:46,131
concentrate and you revert back into your half-orc
form.

1058
01:09:46,131 --> 01:09:49,910
LAURA: I go down and do it, too, 'cause he did
it.

1059
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:51,309
MATT: Okay. Everyone else joining him?

1060
01:09:51,309 --> 01:09:52,420
ALL: Yes.

1061
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:55,036
MATT: All right, so the rest of the party goes,
and they take their physical form.

1062
01:09:55,036 --> 01:09:58,796
(laughter)

1063
01:09:58,796 --> 01:10:00,245
JON: That was awesome, guys.

1064
01:10:00,245 --> 01:10:04,857
LAURA: Is this where it is?

1065
01:10:04,857 --> 01:10:09,095
MATT: You're able to see in the dark for a decent
amount. You walk the perimeter of this space where

1066
01:10:09,095 --> 01:10:18,037
the first cavern was, and you feel around, and you
gather that there was a path here, but it looks

1067
01:10:18,037 --> 01:10:22,853
like there's been a small cave-in. A lot of the
rocks appear like they've been recently fallen in,

1068
01:10:22,853 --> 01:10:29,126
and there's some sort of a grade to them where you
watch loose rocks have recently been tossed around

1069
01:10:29,126 --> 01:10:35,180
that are of a deeper-set red color and haven't
been quite as weathered as the exterior of the

1070
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:41,476
mountain appears to be. So apparently the entrance
that you originally used either has collapsed on

1071
01:10:41,476 --> 01:10:43,843
its own, or was intentionally shut.

1072
01:10:43,843 --> 01:10:49,329
JON: I could've sworn it was right here, you guys.
I don't know what's with all these rocks.

1073
01:10:49,329 --> 01:10:51,531
LAURA: It looks like it was caved in, actually.

1074
01:10:51,531 --> 01:10:53,351
LIAM: This is 100% the spot?

1075
01:10:53,351 --> 01:10:59,084
JON: Pretty sure. I mean, I don't have the best
memory or knowledge or brains or really any

1076
01:10:59,084 --> 01:11:02,020
skills, but I'm pretty sure this was it.

1077
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:03,893
LAURA: Don't be so hard on yourself, Lionel.

1078
01:11:03,893 --> 01:11:06,700
MARISHA: Does it look deliberate, or does it look
natural?

1079
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:08,805
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1080
01:11:08,805 --> 01:11:11,814
JON: Well, it could be. I have an idea, you guys.
Let's ask the ducks!

1081
01:11:11,814 --> 01:11:14,736
LAURA: Are there ducks here?

1082
01:11:14,736 --> 01:11:16,286
JON: There's no ducks here?

1083
01:11:16,286 --> 01:11:19,128
MARISHA: Natural 19 from Gil. 22.

1084
01:11:19,128 --> 01:11:22,039
JON: We can see if there are if we Commune With
Ducks.

1085
01:11:22,039 --> 01:11:28,290
MATT: The cave-in is not natural. The rocks you
can see, the portion of the archway where the

1086
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:37,204
natural mountain rock becomes the rockslide that
seems to have filled the space, there is no damage

1087
01:11:37,204 --> 01:11:42,758
that seems to be seismic or quaked, and you can
see what appear to be some cleft sides at the edge

1088
01:11:42,758 --> 01:11:47,047
of this entrance where it appears like elements of
it were actually hacked or damaged until it

1089
01:11:47,047 --> 01:11:48,675
eventually fell in.

1090
01:11:48,675 --> 01:11:52,850
LAURA: Are there any kind of tracks around, or
footfalls that look like it was recent?

1091
01:11:52,996 --> 01:11:56,052
MATT: Roll a-- for you, it would be a survival
check, 'cause you're a tracker.

1092
01:11:56,052 --> 01:11:57,581
LAURA: And it's a mountain!

1093
01:11:57,581 --> 01:12:00,761
TALIESIN: I honestly think they might have trapped
it.

1094
01:12:00,761 --> 01:12:02,735
LAURA: I can roll that one again.

1095
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:04,597
LIAM: I'll wait until she has looked, and then
I'll take a look.

1096
01:12:04,597 --> 01:12:06,738
LAURA: Yeah, that's way better! 27!

1097
01:12:06,738 --> 01:12:11,690
MATT: As you guys are having this moment, and you
get low to the ground and begin to read the

1098
01:12:11,690 --> 01:12:15,898
patterns of the different rocks that have tumbled
and left small grooves and a little bit of dust

1099
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:23,751
and sand that does reside over this dark, caked
dirt and rock, and you do notice a number of

1100
01:12:23,751 --> 01:12:28,925
footprints. They're scattered a bit, some older,
some newer. There's been a lot of foot traffic in

1101
01:12:28,925 --> 01:12:35,940
and out of this cavern fairly recently, like a
week or so ago. And you begin to follow the

1102
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:40,621
tracks. Some lead back the path you came, some
seem to circle around further into the valley

1103
01:12:40,621 --> 01:12:42,160
around this mountain.

1104
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:48,847
LAURA: I think I've picked something up. Should we
follow it now or should we--

1105
01:12:48,847 --> 01:12:50,344
SAM: It's dark.

1106
01:12:50,344 --> 01:12:52,999
LAURA: -- camp out and do it in the morning.

1107
01:12:52,999 --> 01:12:57,235
MARISHA: Cover for me. I'm gonna drop down and do
a Commune With Nature.

1108
01:12:57,235 --> 01:13:05,139
TRAVIS: How do we cover you?

1109
01:13:05,139 --> 01:13:07,322
TALIESIN: She talks to non-ducks.

1110
01:13:07,322 --> 01:13:14,751
MARISHA: Can Lionel and I commune together and do
bonuses? Can I be like, can you call your ducks?

1111
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:17,264
JON: That's what I was trying to do.

1112
01:13:17,264 --> 01:13:18,501
MARISHA: All right.

1113
01:13:18,501 --> 01:13:23,089
MATT: I'll say, as you begin to cast the spell,
you take Lionel's hands and focus, and Lionel, you

1114
01:13:23,089 --> 01:13:26,989
close your eyes and you imagine before you the
most beautiful desert duck that could ever exist.

1115
01:13:26,989 --> 01:13:34,974
And for a good 45 seconds, 50 seconds, 60 seconds,
nothing. And that sadness in your heart sinks a

1116
01:13:34,974 --> 01:13:42,202
bit, that perhaps Aes, or Scanlan, as these weird
people keep calling him, said, there are no ducks

1117
01:13:42,202 --> 01:13:54,006
here. And you hear, in the darkness, (flapping
wings, squawk, impact sound). It runs into the

1118
01:13:54,006 --> 01:13:59,188
side of the mountain, tumbles down onto the
ground. (duck sounds)

1119
01:13:59,188 --> 01:14:01,142
SAM: It's a miracle!

1120
01:14:01,142 --> 01:14:03,080
TALIESIN: It certainly is.

1121
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,660
JON: The duck!

1122
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:06,606
LAURA: Wait, you can call them to you?

1123
01:14:06,606 --> 01:14:09,493
JON: I mean, I just, normally that happens.

1124
01:14:09,493 --> 01:14:11,679
LAURA: That's a power, that's amazing.

1125
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:13,933
TALIESIN: Do they obey you, or is it a partnership?

1126
01:14:13,933 --> 01:14:17,828
LAURA: Could you call multiple to you and they
pick you up and fly you through the air?

1127
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:20,526
JON: You guys are confusing me. Look, I just talk
to them.

1128
01:14:20,526 --> 01:14:22,082
MARISHA: You know, it's okay.

1129
01:14:22,082 --> 01:14:23,970
TALIESIN: Let's not question this.

1130
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:27,380
MATT: So which of you wants to commune with the
duck?

1131
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:30,011
LIAM: Let the expert.

1132
01:14:30,011 --> 01:14:33,588
JON: Okay, what do we wanna know?

1133
01:14:33,588 --> 01:14:36,172
MARISHA: How deep is the cave-in?

1134
01:14:36,172 --> 01:14:38,562
JON: How deep is the cave-in? Okay.

1135
01:14:38,562 --> 01:14:40,582
SAM: To the duck?

1136
01:14:40,582 --> 01:14:42,936
TALIESIN: They knew about the others.

1137
01:14:42,936 --> 01:14:44,389
SAM: Sure, sure.

1138
01:14:44,389 --> 01:14:46,915
JON: I ask the duck, how deep is the cave-in?

1139
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:53,898
MATT: Okay, the duck, "20 feet".

1140
01:14:53,898 --> 01:14:57,012
(laughter)

1141
01:14:57,012 --> 01:14:59,566
TRAVIS: That's a chill-as-fuck duck, y'all!

1142
01:14:59,566 --> 01:15:02,941
JON: You couldn't understand that. I was like, you
guys, that duck was really chill.

1143
01:15:02,941 --> 01:15:05,260
(laughter)

1144
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:08,121
LAURA: No, I can tell, his body language is super
chill for a duck.

1145
01:15:08,121 --> 01:15:15,702
JON: 20 feet. What else do we want? Do we wanna
ask if he recognizes who did this?

1146
01:15:15,702 --> 01:15:17,790
MARISHA: That's a good one, that's a good one,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

1147
01:15:17,790 --> 01:15:28,041
JON: Hey, greenie. How-- who did this? What caused
the cave-in?

1148
01:15:28,041 --> 01:15:30,658
MATT: "People."

1149
01:15:30,658 --> 01:15:40,631
MARISHA: You know, I have a similar problem when I
try to talk to cows. They have face-blindness.

1150
01:15:40,631 --> 01:15:43,565
LAURA: I'm just gonna stealthily start following
the path around.

1151
01:15:43,565 --> 01:15:45,060
MATT: Stealth check.

1152
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:50,008
MARISHA: Is there another entrance into this
cavern?

1153
01:15:50,008 --> 01:15:56,243
JON: That's good, that's good. Should we ask the
nearest? Where's the nearest entrance?

1154
01:15:56,243 --> 01:15:58,101
LAURA: 29.

1155
01:15:58,101 --> 01:15:59,928
JON: Or the safest entrance?

1156
01:15:59,928 --> 01:16:01,921
MARISHA: Are there other entrances?

1157
01:16:01,921 --> 01:16:12,168
JON: Hey, Greenie, how many other entrances are
there to this, about?

1158
01:16:12,168 --> 01:16:13,918
MATT: "Two."

1159
01:16:13,918 --> 01:16:17,095
JON: Two. Uh-oh, that was two questions.

1160
01:16:17,095 --> 01:16:19,566
MARISHA: Is that two including this entrance?

1161
01:16:19,566 --> 01:16:21,699
MATT: (flapping wings)

1162
01:16:21,699 --> 01:16:24,029
JON: Wait, wait, wait!

1163
01:16:24,029 --> 01:16:26,935
TRAVIS: Duck Hunt! Shoot it! Vex!

1164
01:16:26,935 --> 01:16:31,687
JON: Meant to ask where the entrances are. Sorry,
you guys.

1165
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:37,929
MARISHA: Well, there is another one. It's good,
it's fine, it's good. In fact, I can double down

1166
01:16:37,929 --> 01:16:45,014
on this. Can I now do my Commune With Nature and
see if I can map out this cavern and find the

1167
01:16:45,014 --> 01:16:46,897
other entrances?

1168
01:16:46,897 --> 01:16:57,229
MATT: Okay, so as you've now sat down, and you
focus, you can sense the guardian duck that was

1169
01:16:57,229 --> 01:17:02,153
temporarily summoned is now wandering out to the
desert, probably to dehydrate and die horribly

1170
01:17:02,153 --> 01:17:04,066
when the morning light comes.

1171
01:17:04,066 --> 01:17:09,195
JON: I don't know about this, I don't know about
this. Aw, he's going home to his family.

1172
01:17:09,195 --> 01:17:11,487
TALIESIN: In a way, yes.

1173
01:17:11,487 --> 01:17:19,426
MATT: However, you connect and you can feel your
spiritual essence connect with the land here. The

1174
01:17:19,426 --> 01:17:22,536
landscape is something you're not used to.
Elements of it remind you of Pyrah, though not as

1175
01:17:22,536 --> 01:17:32,059
visceral and volcanic, but the general heat and
barren aspect of the landscape is familiar in some

1176
01:17:32,059 --> 01:17:36,070
ways. So as you extend yourself, you can breathe
and you can feel the land breathe with you, and as

1177
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:39,237
that communion hits, you feel you could ask some
questions of the terrain.

1178
01:17:39,237 --> 01:17:44,314
MARISHA: Where are the other two entrances to this
cavern?

1179
01:17:44,314 --> 01:17:54,228
MATT: You get, as is the essence of answering
these questions, you sense that there is one near

1180
01:17:54,228 --> 01:18:02,717
the top of the spire and there is one not terribly
far from where you are, kind of continuing inward

1181
01:18:02,717 --> 01:18:07,596
towards the valley. But it doesn't specify
directly where, it doesn't put an 'x' on your map

1182
01:18:07,596 --> 01:18:12,623
for you. You just know that one's towards the top,
and one's further around the path you're going.

1183
01:18:12,623 --> 01:18:25,977
MARISHA: Can I-- hang on-- around the path. Okay.
How deep is the Ziggurat from here? Can I sense

1184
01:18:25,977 --> 01:18:27,601
the other Ziggurat?

1185
01:18:27,601 --> 01:18:35,144
MATT: You focus, and you sense that there is
almost like a cyst in the ground. You can sense

1186
01:18:35,144 --> 01:18:47,432
some subterranean cavern. Maybe about 400, 500
feet into the heart of the mountain from where you

1187
01:18:47,432 --> 01:18:53,545
currently sit. You can sense there this kind of
pulsing darkness, almost like a terrible,

1188
01:18:53,545 --> 01:18:56,195
cancerous heartbeat in the center of this land.

1189
01:18:56,195 --> 01:19:04,962
MARISHA: Okay. What else? What's the last one?
What should I do?

1190
01:19:04,962 --> 01:19:07,376
SAM: Are there any people around?

1191
01:19:07,376 --> 01:19:09,736
TALIESIN: Has anybody been through that upper
passageway?

1192
01:19:09,736 --> 01:19:14,863
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, can I sense any other
maraudering douchebags?

1193
01:19:14,863 --> 01:19:19,843
MATT: Well, you can ask questions about people,
powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or

1194
01:19:19,843 --> 01:19:22,849
undead, influence from means of other existences.

1195
01:19:22,849 --> 01:19:25,458
MARISHA: Humanoids? What about humanoids?

1196
01:19:25,458 --> 01:19:33,141
MATT: You want to try and sense humanoids? You ask
about it. Your attention is shifted back towards

1197
01:19:33,141 --> 01:19:43,320
that weird cyst-Ziggurat area in the center of the
mountain, and the land seems to give you the idea

1198
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:46,231
that there are a number of humanoids there right
now.

1199
01:19:46,231 --> 01:19:48,541
MARISHA: Shit. Do they look like cultist-y
people?

1200
01:19:48,541 --> 01:19:52,353
MATT: You don't have a visual. Your vision isn't
brought there, you just kind of sense that they're

1201
01:19:52,353 --> 01:19:55,273
there. They're inside the mountain.

1202
01:19:55,273 --> 01:19:56,987
MARISHA: What?

1203
01:19:56,987 --> 01:19:59,531
JON: I could've told you there was people at the
pyramid.

1204
01:19:59,531 --> 01:20:01,545
TALIESIN: Well, last time. Who's here now?

1205
01:20:01,545 --> 01:20:03,780
JON: Well, why would they leave?

1206
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:07,951
MARISHA: I don't know. I said there's all these
cool cult people.

1207
01:20:07,951 --> 01:20:09,592
Yeah, they could leave.

1208
01:20:09,778 --> 01:20:11,300
JON: It's good to know that they're still there.

1209
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:16,119
TRAVIS: Were there people inside?

1210
01:20:16,119 --> 01:20:17,974
MARISHA: A decent amount of people.

1211
01:20:17,974 --> 01:20:19,638
MATT: So Vex is gone.

1212
01:20:19,638 --> 01:20:21,070
TRAVIS: Where's Vex?

1213
01:20:21,070 --> 01:20:23,182
LIAM: What did you find out?

1214
01:20:23,182 --> 01:20:27,954
MARISHA: A lot of people. There's another entrance
nearby, I think further

1215
01:20:27,954 --> 01:20:29,591
down this path. It's close.

1216
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:31,315
LIAM: Well, Vex went this way. Is it in that
direction?

1217
01:20:31,315 --> 01:20:32,910
MARISHA: What? What do you mean? She went where?

1218
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:35,510
MATT: You actually didn't see the direction she
went.

1219
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:38,686
LIAM: Do we see footprints going in a direction,
though, you described?

1220
01:20:38,686 --> 01:20:42,220
MATT: Nobody else did. Only she was tracking.
Literally,

1221
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:44,151
you all turn around and Vex is just gone.

1222
01:20:44,151 --> 01:20:49,893
MARISHA: I think there's also an entrance at the
top of this spire, if we want to do a downward

1223
01:20:49,893 --> 01:20:52,311
approach, but that seems risky.

1224
01:20:52,311 --> 01:21:01,828
MATT: You follow the tracks, and about 200 or so
feet around the edge, and you have to follow them

1225
01:21:01,828 --> 01:21:06,249
between a few smaller rocks that are jutting out
at the base of the mountain, and the terrain

1226
01:21:06,249 --> 01:21:10,748
itself rolls a bit, and cracks in places. There
are small fissures from recent rains that caused

1227
01:21:10,748 --> 01:21:16,370
the earth to well up and tear in places, and
eventually the tracks curve in towards the

1228
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:21,081
mountain and end, and it's just sheer mountain.
There's no sign of an entryway visually.

1229
01:21:21,081 --> 01:21:22,735
LAURA: Can I search for one?

1230
01:21:22,735 --> 01:21:24,941
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1231
01:21:24,941 --> 01:21:28,094
LAURA: Do I get advantage because it's a
mountain?

1232
01:21:28,094 --> 01:21:31,482
MATT: You do, actually, yes. Favored terrain.

1233
01:21:31,482 --> 01:21:34,293
LAURA: Fucking balls. Perception?

1234
01:21:34,293 --> 01:21:35,703
MATT: Investigation.

1235
01:21:35,703 --> 01:21:38,719
LAURA: No, I want perception.

1236
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:40,554
MATT: You're getting investigation.

1237
01:21:40,554 --> 01:21:42,151
LAURA: 11.

1238
01:21:42,151 --> 01:21:48,225
MATT: 11? You have no idea where the entrance is.
The tracks end in this general vicinity, and it's

1239
01:21:48,225 --> 01:21:52,766
just rock. It doesn't even look like there's
handholds.

1240
01:21:52,766 --> 01:21:59,970
LAURA: Weird. I wonder if it's an illusion. Can I
put my hand on the rocks

1241
01:21:59,970 --> 01:22:01,510
and see if there's an illusion?

1242
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:04,586
MATT: Okay. You put your hands out to feel against
the rock, and your hand passes through.

1243
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:15,700
LAURA: What-what! I feel like Vex is really good
at finding illusions. Oh, shit! Okay, well, can I

1244
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:18,883
put the front of my face through the wall and see
what I see?

1245
01:22:18,883 --> 01:22:24,955
MATT: Sure. You poke into the darkness, and it is
pitch-black on the inside. As you poke past the

1246
01:22:24,955 --> 01:22:33,534
illusion, it's about two inches or so of this
rocky, heavy orange-red stone, and as you peer in

1247
01:22:33,534 --> 01:22:40,379
you can see a cavern about ten feet wide or so and
about 12 to ten feet tall. Natural along the

1248
01:22:40,379 --> 01:22:47,233
walls, you can see the ground itself is smoothed
over, and it's straight. It's a straight tunnel.

1249
01:22:47,233 --> 01:22:51,166
It's not a rocky natural formation, it's like it
was pushed and carved into the rock, like

1250
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:58,956
something heavy or something very focused drove
through. You glance over to the side, and you

1251
01:22:58,956 --> 01:23:09,023
catch what appears to be a face in the wall, about
that big around. It's featureless, you just see

1252
01:23:09,023 --> 01:23:18,642
two eye sockets, a mouth, and a nose. You see a
flash of green light. I need you to make a

1253
01:23:18,642 --> 01:23:20,389
constitution saving throw.

1254
01:23:20,389 --> 01:23:23,748
LAURA: Well, it's too late. Constitution saving
throw?

1255
01:23:23,748 --> 01:23:27,645
TRAVIS: Can we also say that we put our earrings
back in the next day?

1256
01:23:27,645 --> 01:23:28,855
MATT: I assumed you did.

1257
01:23:28,855 --> 01:23:30,517
TRAVIS: Because we're professionals.

1258
01:23:30,517 --> 01:23:36,510
LAURA: That was almost so good, but then it
wasn't. Ten.

1259
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:38,151
MATT: Ten. No, that does not succeed.

1260
01:23:38,151 --> 01:23:42,761
TRAVIS: Curious little cat.

1261
01:23:42,761 --> 01:23:45,799
LAURA: I'm a rogue now, you guys!

1262
01:23:45,799 --> 01:23:47,466
TALIESIN: Had to poke it.

1263
01:23:47,466 --> 01:23:56,524
MATT: You take 61 points of necrotic damage. As a
familiar sting, as the green light flash turns

1264
01:23:56,524 --> 01:24:02,276
into a piercing beam of life-draining energy, one
that once almost brought you to the edge of death

1265
01:24:02,276 --> 01:24:07,440
before, and as it hits you, you feel your breath
and life essence sucked out of your nose and mouth

1266
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:13,333
and ears like a giant vacuum is pulling the
essence out of your body. The veins bulge, you

1267
01:24:13,333 --> 01:24:18,062
can't breathe, and you pull yourself back out of
the illusory wall, and have to gasp for a moment.

1268
01:24:18,062 --> 01:24:20,822
You guys hear the gasping as you begin to approach
that side, and you find

1269
01:24:20,822 --> 01:24:23,146
your sister there grabbing herself.

1270
01:24:23,146 --> 01:24:28,019
LAURA: (coughing) Jenga. Not full Jenga.

1271
01:24:28,019 --> 01:24:29,995
ASHLEY: What happened, what happened, what
happened?

1272
01:24:29,995 --> 01:24:34,965
LAURA: Don't go through the wall. Can I heal,
Pike?

1273
01:24:34,965 --> 01:24:36,505
ASHLEY: Yes, yes.

1274
01:24:36,505 --> 01:24:41,220
LAURA: There's a thing in there. There's a face,
and it sucks your life out. I found a door,

1275
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:42,320
though, guys!

1276
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,030
JON: Where's the door?

1277
01:24:44,030 --> 01:24:46,491
LAURA: Don't. I'm not even going to tell you where
the door is.

1278
01:24:46,491 --> 01:24:48,457
I'm not going to tell him where the door is.

1279
01:24:48,457 --> 01:24:50,688
TRAVIS: We don't see a door.

1280
01:24:50,688 --> 01:24:52,207
JON: I don't see a door.

1281
01:24:52,207 --> 01:24:56,290
LAURA: Nobody touch the rocks!

1282
01:24:56,290 --> 01:24:58,296
LIAM: But there's a bad door somewhere around
here?

1283
01:24:58,296 --> 01:25:05,037
LAURA: There's a bad door. Just listen for a
moment. Bad door. Right in front of me: fake, bad

1284
01:25:05,037 --> 01:25:11,497
door. If you go through it, there is a very bad
face that sucks your life out.

1285
01:25:11,497 --> 01:25:12,804
LIAM: A bad face.

1286
01:25:12,804 --> 01:25:14,052
LAURA: Yeah.

1287
01:25:14,052 --> 01:25:17,680
TALIESIN: There's a door you cannot see, and a bad
face sucks your life away.

1288
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:25,181
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to take my Oracle Arrow and
crouch down.

1289
01:25:25,181 --> 01:25:27,643
SAM: Wait, wait, wait, before you do that, are you
sure that's--

1290
01:25:27,643 --> 01:25:29,493
LIAM: Yeah, slow down, you're doing all the shit.

1291
01:25:29,493 --> 01:25:31,971
SAM: You're going to just shoot something in
there? What if they see it fly in?

1292
01:25:31,971 --> 01:25:34,628
LAURA: That's why I was going to crouch down and
shoot the arrow super low to the ground.

1293
01:25:34,628 --> 01:25:36,988
LIAM: What if they still see the arrow fly in?

1294
01:25:36,988 --> 01:25:41,184
LAURA: Well, when I peeked my head in, before I
got my life sucked out, I didn't see anything in

1295
01:25:41,184 --> 01:25:42,321
front of me. Did I?

1296
01:25:42,321 --> 01:25:46,753
LIAM: I'm going to assume that before we heard her
gasping, Keyleth was filling us in.

1297
01:25:46,753 --> 01:25:54,633
MARISHA: You know, I think it's right around that
direction. Follow the gasping. It feels like it's

1298
01:25:54,633 --> 01:25:56,295
really close to the gasping.

1299
01:25:56,295 --> 01:26:02,202
LIAM: I'm going to go check out the top. (mist
sound)

1300
01:26:02,202 --> 01:26:04,831
LAURA: Give me shit, and then take off on your
own.

1301
01:26:04,831 --> 01:26:06,773
LIAM: Well, I'm not going to stick my face in
something.

1302
01:26:06,773 --> 01:26:15,963
MATT: All right. So you fly up. (flapping wings)
60 feet a round. It'll take you a good five

1303
01:26:15,963 --> 01:26:20,219
minutes or so to make your way towards the top end
of the spire. As you're going, make an

1304
01:26:20,219 --> 01:26:21,611
investigation check.

1305
01:26:21,611 --> 01:26:23,464
LIAM: Can I stealth as cloud?

1306
01:26:23,464 --> 01:26:27,694
MATT: Oh, you're going cloud! Sorry, I thought you
were doing your wings. As a cloud, you get there

1307
01:26:27,694 --> 01:26:33,527
really fast. So as you make it up there, you
cannot-- I will say, for the purposes of this...

1308
01:26:33,527 --> 01:26:36,310
LIAM: I'm wind. I'm not going high, I'm going
through the treetops.

1309
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:38,978
MATT: Yeah, so make a stealth check.

1310
01:26:38,978 --> 01:26:45,550
LIAM: All right, I will. That is very good. That
is a 35.

1311
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:51,904
MATT: 35, okay. As far as you understand, no one
seems to see you. Make an investigation check as

1312
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:54,544
you make your way up the mountainside to check for
any sort of entrances.

1313
01:26:54,544 --> 01:26:56,816
LAURA: You should mark off one of your Lucks
because you already used it for the day.

1314
01:26:56,816 --> 01:26:58,462
LIAM: I did, it's on the plastic.

1315
01:26:58,462 --> 01:27:00,333
SAM: Keep him honest.

1316
01:27:00,333 --> 01:27:10,911
LIAM: Oh man. I love you so wholeheartedly, and on
a regular basis you kick me in the goolies. I

1317
01:27:10,911 --> 01:27:12,466
don't understand it.

1318
01:27:12,466 --> 01:27:15,000
SAM: Good old four-Luck O'Brien.

1319
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:26,889
LIAM: Seven Luck. It's not per game, it's per day,
so if we go to bed, it resets. Fart knockers. I'm

1320
01:27:26,889 --> 01:27:32,071
doing investigation? That's 18.

1321
01:27:32,071 --> 01:27:41,573
MATT: 18. You glide around there for a good ten,
15 minutes or so, scouring the edge. All you know

1322
01:27:41,573 --> 01:27:44,124
is it's near the top, and you see no sign of an
entrance.

1323
01:27:44,124 --> 01:27:47,148
LIAM: Okay. So it's not a volcanic hole or
anything, there's just a secret entrance.

1324
01:27:47,148 --> 01:27:51,299
MATT: No. She told you there was supposedly an
entrance, but you see nothing. Sheer rock. There

1325
01:27:51,299 --> 01:27:54,753
are a couple of indents that could be cave
entrances, but when you get close you see it's

1326
01:27:54,753 --> 01:27:57,040
just a small alcove that ends.

1327
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,991
LAURA: Maybe you should try sticking your face
against some of the sheer rock face.

1328
01:27:59,991 --> 01:28:08,479
LIAM: I return to my loving sister, kind and good.
I land, and say, I saw another face, but I didn't

1329
01:28:08,479 --> 01:28:10,610
stick my face in it, because that would be
stupid.

1330
01:28:10,610 --> 01:28:14,127
MARISHA: I wonder if there's another face behind
the cave-in.

1331
01:28:14,127 --> 01:28:18,096
LAURA: You know what, I should probably find out!
And I shoot the Oracle Arrow.

1332
01:28:18,096 --> 01:28:20,437
MATT: Okay. You shoot the Oracle Arrow and--

1333
01:28:20,437 --> 01:28:23,598
MARISHA: Wait, into the cave-in, or the illusory
wall?

1334
01:28:23,598 --> 01:28:26,344
MATT: How far do you fire it? Is it full strength,
is it a lob?

1335
01:28:26,344 --> 01:28:30,149
LAURA: No, I don't want to go crazy far. I want to
get in, a little bit further to see if I can find

1336
01:28:30,149 --> 01:28:32,337
any more traps, and see how that face works.

1337
01:28:32,337 --> 01:28:36,207
TRAVIS: What percentage of your strength do you
shoot it at? 70? 50? 25?

1338
01:28:36,207 --> 01:28:38,594
LAURA: 65 percent of my strength is used.

1339
01:28:38,594 --> 01:28:46,203
MATT: Okay. (whoosh) As you release it, it's still
a good distance. It (whoosh) continues through. As

1340
01:28:46,203 --> 01:28:51,488
you go past the face, the one that shot the green
light, you can see the front of it is darkened

1341
01:28:51,488 --> 01:28:59,324
now, from where before it was untouched. It
cruises past. You see the formations. It looks

1342
01:28:59,324 --> 01:29:05,080
like there's some cool designs here and there. The
arrow eventually comes to rest. You don't see

1343
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:12,874
anything of interest as you pass by that quickly.
You do see a very, very faint glow down the hall.

1344
01:29:12,874 --> 01:29:19,048
You can see the glimmer of light, and as you
watch, it's shifting ever so slightly, flickering

1345
01:29:19,048 --> 01:29:20,455
like firelight.

1346
01:29:20,455 --> 01:29:22,271
LAURA: I think there's a fire further in.

1347
01:29:22,271 --> 01:29:24,344
TRAVIS: Was the face there?

1348
01:29:24,344 --> 01:29:25,765
LAURA: The face is in there.

1349
01:29:25,765 --> 01:29:27,306
TRAVIS: Was it doing the life-sucking thing?

1350
01:29:27,306 --> 01:29:30,332
LAURA: Not to my arrow. But it was there on the
wall.

1351
01:29:30,332 --> 01:29:31,604
TRAVIS: I'll go in.

1352
01:29:31,604 --> 01:29:33,131
LAURA: No, no, no, Grog, don't!

1353
01:29:33,131 --> 01:29:34,947
ASHLEY: She got hurt!

1354
01:29:34,947 --> 01:29:36,671
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I'm stacked for days.

1355
01:29:36,671 --> 01:29:38,214
LAURA: We should dispel it or something.

1356
01:29:38,214 --> 01:29:40,223
JON: I got your back, Grog.

1357
01:29:40,223 --> 01:29:43,050
TALIESIN: We've got another entrance.

1358
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:44,657
MARISHA: I can Dispel Magic still.

1359
01:29:44,657 --> 01:29:47,037
LAURA: Yeah, see if you can dispel the magic!

1360
01:29:47,037 --> 01:29:48,874
TALIESIN: Let's see if there's a second entrance.

1361
01:29:48,874 --> 01:29:52,050
MARISHA: Well, there is a second entrance. One is
up top.

1362
01:29:52,050 --> 01:29:56,660
TALIESIN: Well, they're going to think we're
coming in through here, because they know about

1363
01:29:56,660 --> 01:30:00,907
this entrance. Maybe they don't know about the
other one, so we could maybe be super tricky and

1364
01:30:00,907 --> 01:30:02,757
take an entrance they don't know about at all.

1365
01:30:02,757 --> 01:30:07,900
MARISHA: I can clear out the cave-in. I imagine if
someone is trying to cause an intentional cave-in,

1366
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:12,504
they're anticipating no one going through that
cave-in, and we can start there.

1367
01:30:12,504 --> 01:30:15,436
JON: I at least know my way in, if we cleared
that.

1368
01:30:15,436 --> 01:30:21,778
TALIESIN: If I were expecting people, I'd expect
them through the entrance I take or the cave-in,

1369
01:30:21,778 --> 01:30:26,012
not a third entrance I don't know about, though.
Assuming they don't know about it.

1370
01:30:26,012 --> 01:30:28,953
MARISHA: But they do know about the up. He said
there was a face.

1371
01:30:28,953 --> 01:30:31,344
JON: No, he's talking about the third entrance,
that's lower.

1372
01:30:31,344 --> 01:30:32,674
TALIESIN: Higher.

1373
01:30:32,674 --> 01:30:34,237
JON: No, I thought that was the higher one.

1374
01:30:34,237 --> 01:30:40,422
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on. There are three
entrances: the cave-in, the one where Vex just got

1375
01:30:40,422 --> 01:30:42,562
exploded, and one through the top of the spire.

1376
01:30:42,562 --> 01:30:44,548
LIAM: Which I could not find.

1377
01:30:44,548 --> 01:30:47,426
TALIESIN: Should we take a group look for the top
of the spire?

1378
01:30:47,426 --> 01:30:51,159
MARISHA: If we go through the cave-in entrance, I
can clear it out. I will clear one of my last

1379
01:30:51,159 --> 01:30:54,556
high-level spells, but Lionel knows his way
through that way.

1380
01:30:54,556 --> 01:30:57,762
LAURA: Yeah, but we shouldn't go in the night. We
need to rest.

1381
01:30:57,762 --> 01:30:59,493
MARISHA: But I can clear it tonight.

1382
01:30:59,493 --> 01:31:05,555
TALIESIN: We could just make a tiny hole in the
cave-in and become smoke and go inside. Is that

1383
01:31:05,555 --> 01:31:08,191
not possible? He asked.

1384
01:31:08,191 --> 01:31:10,877
MATT: That may be quite possible, actually.

1385
01:31:10,877 --> 01:31:12,900
TALIESIN: So that they wouldn't even know that we
had cleared it.

1386
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:15,230
It would just be relatively untouched.

1387
01:31:15,230 --> 01:31:16,799
MARISHA: Can we camp out inside?

1388
01:31:16,799 --> 01:31:19,288
MATT: It's a gaseous form, so yeah.

1389
01:31:19,288 --> 01:31:22,078
LAURA: We would have to camp inside the cave-in.

1390
01:31:22,078 --> 01:31:27,159
TALIESIN: It's either that or camp right in front
of the front door after just triggering a spell.

1391
01:31:27,159 --> 01:31:34,993
LAURA: Oh, Scanlan! We've been so long without
you, I forgot we had it!

1392
01:31:34,993 --> 01:31:38,775
MARISHA: Oh my god, we have the mansion!

1393
01:31:38,775 --> 01:31:41,403
LIAM: I mean, only if you want to. I remember that
being a sore spot.

1394
01:31:41,403 --> 01:31:48,600
SAM: I don't even know if you guys want me to come
in with you. I've taken you this far. But if you

1395
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,267
need me in there, I'll come.

1396
01:31:50,267 --> 01:31:54,051
ASHLEY: No, you'll be coming.

1397
01:31:54,051 --> 01:31:59,542
SAM: All right. Let's make a hole and go in, and
then we can camp the night inside.

1398
01:31:59,542 --> 01:32:05,429
JON: I think some of my dead comrades we could use
as pillows. They're probably still in there.

1399
01:32:05,429 --> 01:32:06,978
TALIESIN: That may not be necessary.

1400
01:32:06,978 --> 01:32:10,204
ASHLEY: Body pillow.

1401
01:32:10,204 --> 01:32:17,346
TALIESIN: I'm so proud of you! That was amazing!

1402
01:32:17,346 --> 01:32:21,891
MATT: So what's the plan, guys?

1403
01:32:21,891 --> 01:32:29,473
LAURA: We're going to go back to the cave-in. Oh,
wait, wait, wait! I did have a question. I feel

1404
01:32:29,473 --> 01:32:33,459
like it might be smart to get my arrow out of
there, in case anybody

1405
01:32:33,459 --> 01:32:35,714
comes out and sees an arrow.

1406
01:32:35,714 --> 01:32:37,380
ASHLEY: That's a good idea.

1407
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:40,992
LAURA: But I don't know how to do that. Is there
an Unseen Servant or something?

1408
01:32:40,992 --> 01:32:42,610
JON: I'll run in real fast and get it.

1409
01:32:42,610 --> 01:32:48,200
SAM: No, do not do that. I, Scanlan Shorthalt, can
go get it, if you'd like.

1410
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:50,002
LAURA: No, Scanlan, that's not what I meant.

1411
01:32:50,002 --> 01:32:51,443
SAM: I can go get it if you'd like.

1412
01:32:51,443 --> 01:32:53,396
LAURA: No, I don't want you to go in! It fucking
sucks your life out!

1413
01:32:53,396 --> 01:32:56,502
SAM: It's easy. I'll be there and back in two
seconds.

1414
01:32:56,502 --> 01:32:58,244
JON: But there's a face-sucking thing.

1415
01:32:58,244 --> 01:33:00,999
LAURA: Do I know how many feet in it went?

1416
01:33:00,999 --> 01:33:10,004
MATT: You're not entirely certain. I'd say a
couple hundred, maybe. 150.

1417
01:33:10,004 --> 01:33:11,822
TRAVIS: You did 65 percent of your...

1418
01:33:11,822 --> 01:33:21,598
SAM: You're an expert marksman, you know. Within
100 feet? Yeah, how about this? Why don't you

1419
01:33:21,598 --> 01:33:25,203
shoot an arrow right now, outside the cave, same
strength, and see how far it goes?

1420
01:33:25,203 --> 01:33:26,475
LAURA: You got it.

1421
01:33:26,475 --> 01:33:28,945
MATT: Okay. So what's the range on your bow?

1422
01:33:28,945 --> 01:33:34,949
LAURA: Oh, that's a good question. Fenthras,
exalted.

1423
01:33:34,949 --> 01:33:38,550
MATT: It's a longbow. It's just a general
longbow's range. Do you have that written down?

1424
01:33:38,550 --> 01:33:44,037
LAURA: What? Like 120 feet? Is it that, or is it
more?

1425
01:33:44,037 --> 01:33:48,795
MATT: 150 is your first increment, and then 600 is
your second increment.

1426
01:33:48,795 --> 01:33:54,020
TALIESIN: 65 is like 400 feet.

1427
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:55,474
MATT: Approximately, yeah.

1428
01:33:55,474 --> 01:33:58,044
TALIESIN: Or the closest wall. Did it hit a wall?

1429
01:33:58,044 --> 01:33:59,460
MATT: It did not hit a wall.

1430
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:00,921
TALIESIN: 400 feet.

1431
01:34:00,921 --> 01:34:04,004
LAURA: That's really far. No, but how would you do
it? How would you do it?

1432
01:34:04,004 --> 01:34:06,277
SAM: I have ways.

1433
01:34:06,277 --> 01:34:11,206
LIAM: Could you see through the mouth of this face
that you saw, when you were in there?

1434
01:34:11,206 --> 01:34:12,757
LAURA: I saw eyes.

1435
01:34:12,757 --> 01:34:18,272
MATT: There was no eyes. There was empty sockets,
a mouth, and a nose, and then suddenly the sockets

1436
01:34:18,272 --> 01:34:20,449
began to glow green for a second, and then the
hit.

1437
01:34:20,449 --> 01:34:22,541
LAURA: The sockets glowed green and then I got
hit.

1438
01:34:22,541 --> 01:34:24,670
LIAM: So you couldn't see through the mouth, it
was just a dark maw.

1439
01:34:24,670 --> 01:34:26,362
LAURA: Right. But the eyes glowed.

1440
01:34:26,362 --> 01:34:28,520
ASHLEY: You're just going to go in there,
Scanlan?

1441
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:30,076
SAM: You want to come?

1442
01:34:30,076 --> 01:34:34,489
ASHLEY: How are you going to do this?

1443
01:34:34,489 --> 01:34:36,677
SAM: The way I always go. Dimension Door.

1444
01:34:36,677 --> 01:34:39,580
LAURA: What if it can reach you that far in?

1445
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:41,173
SAM: It can't.

1446
01:34:41,173 --> 01:34:43,316
ASHLEY: How do you know?

1447
01:34:43,316 --> 01:34:45,028
SAM: I assume.

1448
01:34:45,028 --> 01:34:51,436
ASHLEY: Well, I'm not going with you!

1449
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:53,115
SAM: Great.

1450
01:34:53,115 --> 01:34:55,090
LIAM: I'll go with you.

1451
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:56,216
SAM: You can't.

1452
01:34:56,216 --> 01:34:57,786
LAURA: You're too big.

1453
01:34:57,786 --> 01:35:02,299
SAM: I'll just go. Dimension Door 400 feet
straight in.

1454
01:35:02,299 --> 01:35:06,798
ASHLEY: Wait, I'll go with him. I'm going to go
with you. I'm keeping my eye on him.

1455
01:35:06,798 --> 01:35:13,860
MATT: All right. (poof) You guys appear inside the
cavern. Darkness. You can see the firelight ahead,

1456
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:18,329
the flicker at the end of the tunnel, and you can
see the tunnel, the straight portion of it, maybe

1457
01:35:18,329 --> 01:35:22,320
100 feet forward, begins to shift and bend a
little bit. It starts to turn into more of a

1458
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:27,383
natural cavern as it goes. Whatever drove its way
in here has merged with a natural path on the

1459
01:35:27,383 --> 01:35:35,321
inside of the mountain, possibly even merged with
the cave-in path. You look on the ground, and both

1460
01:35:35,321 --> 01:35:38,103
of you guys make investigation checks, if you
don't mind.

1461
01:35:38,103 --> 01:35:43,290
ASHLEY: Investigation, did you say?

1462
01:35:43,290 --> 01:35:44,730
SAM: 30.

1463
01:35:44,730 --> 01:35:50,336
ASHLEY: I'm sure he found something. 11.

1464
01:35:50,336 --> 01:35:56,569
MATT: In the time it takes you to go, "Okay, we're
looking..." He's like, "Found it!" You find the

1465
01:35:56,569 --> 01:36:00,866
arrow. A little dust drifts off of it, and as
you're walking you can see that there's a softness

1466
01:36:00,866 --> 01:36:07,142
to the ground here. You get the sense that the
formation, whatever rock was pushed through here,

1467
01:36:07,142 --> 01:36:16,390
was... There's no pile of rock outside, there's no
symbol of the earth that was carved out of this

1468
01:36:16,390 --> 01:36:22,323
tunnel, recently it seems, placed anywhere.
There's just an absence of rock, and there's a

1469
01:36:22,323 --> 01:36:24,533
heavy layer of dust on the ground.

1470
01:36:24,533 --> 01:36:35,086
LAURA: Do either of you have Dust of
Tracelessness?

1471
01:36:35,086 --> 01:36:36,384
ASHLEY: No. Well.

1472
01:36:36,384 --> 01:36:37,412
SAM: Go back?

1473
01:36:37,412 --> 01:36:38,683
ASHLEY: Yeah. Let's go back.

1474
01:36:38,683 --> 01:36:40,056
SAM: Will you hold my hand?

1475
01:36:40,056 --> 01:36:42,129
ASHLEY: No. No, don't push your luck.

1476
01:36:42,129 --> 01:36:45,765
MATT: (poof) You guys bamf back out of the
outside. You watch as Scanlan and Pike reemerge

1477
01:36:45,765 --> 01:36:48,362
from the outside, Scanlan holding your arrow
triumphant.

1478
01:36:48,362 --> 01:36:53,107
LAURA: Oh, it's dusty. Was it dusty in there?

1479
01:36:53,107 --> 01:36:55,115
SAM: It was very dusty in there.

1480
01:36:55,115 --> 01:36:56,708
LIAM: Any footprints?

1481
01:36:56,708 --> 01:36:59,237
ASHLEY: None that we could see.

1482
01:36:59,237 --> 01:37:01,238
SAM: Soft un-tread earth.

1483
01:37:01,238 --> 01:37:02,665
LIAM: Weird.

1484
01:37:02,665 --> 01:37:03,963
LAURA: Thank you.

1485
01:37:03,963 --> 01:37:05,425
MARISHA: Oh, no.

1486
01:37:05,425 --> 01:37:08,245
LIAM: What is it, Kiki?

1487
01:37:08,245 --> 01:37:15,981
MARISHA: Maybe this is the unused entrance. Maybe
the cave-in is the more recent.

1488
01:37:15,981 --> 01:37:20,254
LAURA: No, I see tracks coming in and out of this
place. I know there's people that use this.

1489
01:37:20,254 --> 01:37:21,885
MATT: Yeah, fairly recent tracks.

1490
01:37:21,885 --> 01:37:24,968
LIAM: But you saw no footprints inside?

1491
01:37:24,968 --> 01:37:29,469
ASHLEY: Did you, Scanlan? You should've seen
something. Did you look?

1492
01:37:29,469 --> 01:37:33,604
SAM: No, I forgot. I was looking for the arrow.
That was our mission.

1493
01:37:33,604 --> 01:37:38,326
ASHLEY: Well, I was just making sure you weren't
going to run away, so I was preoccupied.

1494
01:37:38,326 --> 01:37:40,773
JON: So you guys both accomplished your missions!
Awesome!

1495
01:37:40,773 --> 01:37:50,258
LAURA: Maybe we should go back into the other
side, then. Unless somebody can just fucking dispel

1496
01:37:50,258 --> 01:37:52,907
that face, and then we can just go in this way.

1497
01:37:52,907 --> 01:37:56,868
MARISHA: I could attempt it. I have Dispel Magic
with me right now.

1498
01:37:56,868 --> 01:37:57,968
TRAVIS: Do it!

1499
01:37:57,968 --> 01:37:59,776
MARISHA: All right. I'll do it.

1500
01:37:59,776 --> 01:38:03,018
LIAM: Is the plan to camp out tonight? In the
mansion, by a fire, whichever?

1501
01:38:03,018 --> 01:38:04,291
LAURA: In the mansion.

1502
01:38:04,291 --> 01:38:09,200
TALIESIN: I'm going to point out, I've already
been looking for a way into the cave-in while

1503
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:11,057
you've all been being ridiculous.

1504
01:38:11,057 --> 01:38:13,167
LAURA: You've already gone back?

1505
01:38:13,167 --> 01:38:17,698
TALIESIN: The minute he suggested that he get it,
I didn't want to be a part of that, so I just

1506
01:38:17,698 --> 01:38:23,057
immediately went in to start testing to see if
there was ways we could just meld through the

1507
01:38:23,057 --> 01:38:25,175
cave-in, or if we actually had to make a hole.

1508
01:38:25,175 --> 01:38:28,315
MATT: So you're inspecting?

1509
01:38:28,315 --> 01:38:32,784
TALIESIN: I misty-ed out of that the minute that
he started working on it.

1510
01:38:32,784 --> 01:38:35,334
MATT: So you're over, currently looking for a way
through?

1511
01:38:35,334 --> 01:38:38,253
TALIESIN: Seeing if I can find ways through.

1512
01:38:38,253 --> 01:38:43,648
MATT: You manage to squeeze through a few crevices
between the stones and rock, but it's pretty

1513
01:38:43,648 --> 01:38:47,920
densely packed. You get maybe five feet in before
you can't really find a way to get your whole mist

1514
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:48,941
form through.

1515
01:38:48,941 --> 01:38:54,001
TALIESIN: I'm going to start, back to normal, at
the very top of the pile, looking to see if I can

1516
01:38:54,001 --> 01:38:58,384
start scraping through using my sword to make a
crevice.

1517
01:38:58,384 --> 01:39:00,518
MATT: Okay, so you're working on that. What are
you guys doing?

1518
01:39:00,518 --> 01:39:07,512
SAM: Are we trying to dispel the magic or are we
going in the other way? Maybe we should just make

1519
01:39:07,512 --> 01:39:08,936
a decision.

1520
01:39:08,936 --> 01:39:10,507
MARISHA: I'm trying to dispel the magic.

1521
01:39:10,507 --> 01:39:12,130
MATT: Okay. So you walk up to the illusory wall.

1522
01:39:12,130 --> 01:39:18,531
MARISHA: I'm having Vex be like, tell me where it
is. Can I prepare it so as soon as I poke my head

1523
01:39:18,531 --> 01:39:20,291
in, I can be like (dink)!

1524
01:39:20,291 --> 01:39:23,542
MATT: Okay. You poke your head in, and as soon as
you glance off to the side, you can see the stone

1525
01:39:23,542 --> 01:39:24,868
face in the wall.

1526
01:39:24,868 --> 01:39:26,172
MARISHA: (poof)

1527
01:39:26,172 --> 01:39:29,911
MATT: Cast Dispel Magic... Doesn't seem to have an
effect.

1528
01:39:29,911 --> 01:39:32,053
MARISHA: Bail. Bail! Bail! Out!

1529
01:39:32,053 --> 01:39:34,652
LAURA: Did it hit you that fast? It didn't hit
you?

1530
01:39:34,652 --> 01:39:37,517
MATT: There was no attack from the face, either.

1531
01:39:37,517 --> 01:39:41,131
TALIESIN: I get the distinct impression, perhaps,
that you used it up, and probably alerted them

1532
01:39:41,131 --> 01:39:43,194
that somebody was at that entrance.

1533
01:39:43,194 --> 01:39:45,127
LAURA: Let's maybe move away from the entrance.

1534
01:39:45,127 --> 01:39:48,516
MARISHA: Can I peek my head back in and do a...

1535
01:39:48,516 --> 01:39:53,516
MATT: You glance in. No trigger, nothing. The face
seems inert.

1536
01:39:53,516 --> 01:39:56,626
LAURA: I peek my head in. Does the flickering
light in the distance seem brighter?

1537
01:39:56,626 --> 01:39:58,509
MATT: Make a perception check.

1538
01:39:58,509 --> 01:40:04,867
LAURA: It's too many choices. Too many dice.
Fucking shit, motherfuck!

1539
01:40:04,867 --> 01:40:07,423
Wait, wait, it's a mountain.

1540
01:40:07,423 --> 01:40:10,869
MATT: It is a mountain. You get to have an
advantage. That's what rangers do, man!

1541
01:40:10,869 --> 01:40:13,180
LIAM: Was the light seen by the arrow?

1542
01:40:13,180 --> 01:40:16,079
MATT: The light was seen by the arrow.

1543
01:40:16,079 --> 01:40:18,103
LIAM: So you're looking at the face.

1544
01:40:18,103 --> 01:40:20,316
LAURA: No, I'm looking in the fucking tunnel.

1545
01:40:20,316 --> 01:40:21,990
MATT: The face is on the side of it. It's beyond.

1546
01:40:21,990 --> 01:40:23,191
LIAM: Oh, it keeps going?

1547
01:40:23,191 --> 01:40:26,071
MATT: Yeah. So depending on how high her
perception is, she may, now that she sees the

1548
01:40:26,071 --> 01:40:28,827
flicker at the end, she may be able to see
something. So how high did you roll?

1549
01:40:28,827 --> 01:40:30,093
LAURA: 31.

1550
01:40:30,093 --> 01:40:34,578
MATT: That would be high enough to just barely
focus your half-elven eyes and glance down. You

1551
01:40:34,578 --> 01:40:40,311
get to see the very faint bead of light at the
very tip, and it doesn't seem to change over the

1552
01:40:40,311 --> 01:40:44,052
next 30 seconds, next minute, next two minutes
while you focus intently.

1553
01:40:44,052 --> 01:40:46,421
You don't see any shift or change.

1554
01:40:46,421 --> 01:40:49,478
ASHLEY: Should we just go in?

1555
01:40:49,478 --> 01:40:50,740
LAURA: We could.

1556
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:53,218
JON: So you think the face is recharging?

1557
01:40:53,218 --> 01:40:58,339
LAURA: I think I might have used up its only
charge, potentially. Or it's recharging.

1558
01:40:58,339 --> 01:41:00,363
JON: It's like a booby trap, used once.

1559
01:41:00,363 --> 01:41:05,593
LIAM: I will take a look at it, and look at the
area and see if there's anything left to it or

1560
01:41:05,593 --> 01:41:07,612
other traps further down.

1561
01:41:07,612 --> 01:41:09,780
MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.

1562
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:12,991
SAM: Well, if he's going in, Taryon will go in and
Identify the thing.

1563
01:41:12,991 --> 01:41:16,183
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an arcana check.

1564
01:41:16,183 --> 01:41:17,283
LIAM: 19.

1565
01:41:17,283 --> 01:41:21,306
MATT: 19, okay. You glance by, you check it. As
you both are looking at it, both Taryon and Vax

1566
01:41:21,306 --> 01:41:29,121
approach the face, and the carving is rudimentary.
It looks more like it was prepared as the basis

1567
01:41:29,121 --> 01:41:30,583
of-- what did you roll?

1568
01:41:30,583 --> 01:41:32,276
SAM: 17, but I've got Identify.

1569
01:41:32,276 --> 01:41:36,693
MATT: Yeah. There's no magical essence to it any
longer, but your arcana check shows that you can

1570
01:41:36,693 --> 01:41:42,442
see that there are certain small carvings in it
that look to be some sort of sigil or glyph that

1571
01:41:42,442 --> 01:41:47,811
is designed to hold a spell until triggered, and
then it's released. Actually, Pike, you've used

1572
01:41:47,811 --> 01:41:55,349
this once before. It's an actual Glyph of Warding
spell that is utilized to hold a spell in and

1573
01:41:55,349 --> 01:41:57,644
release it upon some sort of a trigger.

1574
01:41:57,644 --> 01:42:00,057
SAM: So it's one-time use, so we're good to go in
this way if we'd like.

1575
01:42:00,057 --> 01:42:02,927
LAURA: Does the Glyph of Warding alert you once
it's gone off?

1576
01:42:02,927 --> 01:42:05,392
ASHLEY: I don't think so.

1577
01:42:05,392 --> 01:42:10,231
MATT: You don't recall. You didn't know your glyph
went off until you found the destroyed body of the

1578
01:42:10,231 --> 01:42:12,621
prisoner that you had released in Westruun long
ago.

1579
01:42:12,621 --> 01:42:15,902
LAURA: Oh, right. The guy that was stealing all
that gold.

1580
01:42:15,902 --> 01:42:19,598
ASHLEY: And then I think we also put one on the
top of the loot for the dragon?

1581
01:42:19,598 --> 01:42:23,150
MATT: That's the one that got him. He tried to get
some money on the way out, and you found his body

1582
01:42:23,150 --> 01:42:26,418
blown up and dragged about 20 feet off before he
expired.

1583
01:42:26,418 --> 01:42:28,206
ASHLEY: Yeah, I don't think it alerts anybody.

1584
01:42:28,206 --> 01:42:35,574
LAURA: Okay, good. Then we are probably safe going
in. I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on us.

1585
01:42:35,574 --> 01:42:44,319
I'm going to see how many people I can cast it on.
Every creature I choose within 30 feet of me! So,

1586
01:42:44,319 --> 01:42:46,230
sweet, it's everybody.

1587
01:42:46,230 --> 01:42:52,400
MATT: Yep. All right. You notice, Lionel, as you
guys step in, even in your Darkvision-- which, by

1588
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:59,336
the way, for your two human companions, it is
complete darkness. You had a little bit of

1589
01:42:59,336 --> 01:43:02,365
starlight, and your eyes had adjusted to it where
you could see the edges and rims of different

1590
01:43:02,365 --> 01:43:06,239
shapes within the mountain range, but once you
step past the illusory barrier into the interior

1591
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:08,394
of the cavern, it is just darkness.

1592
01:43:08,394 --> 01:43:09,824
LAURA: Is Percy back yet?

1593
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:12,549
TALIESIN: Yes, I just got back.

1594
01:43:12,549 --> 01:43:14,853
LAURA: Percy, hold on to my waist, dear.

1595
01:43:14,853 --> 01:43:16,521
SAM: Should we use our flashlights or no?

1596
01:43:16,521 --> 01:43:18,008
TALIESIN: No, I don't think so.

1597
01:43:18,008 --> 01:43:20,566
LIAM: I'm going to stay 30 feet in front of the
group and continue to check for traps.

1598
01:43:20,566 --> 01:43:23,377
MATT: All right, so everyone roll stealth.

1599
01:43:23,377 --> 01:43:29,922
LAURA: And add ten to it because of Pass Without a
Trace.

1600
01:43:29,922 --> 01:43:34,899
SAM: Doty's going to click his boots of whatever.
His boots of elven...

1601
01:43:34,899 --> 01:43:38,295
MATT: That give him the bonus on stealth checks?

1602
01:43:38,295 --> 01:43:40,118
SAM: Yeah, elvenkind.

1603
01:43:40,118 --> 01:43:44,039
TRAVIS: 26.

1604
01:43:44,039 --> 01:43:51,357
ASHLEY: 30! That's never going to happen again.

1605
01:43:51,357 --> 01:43:54,254
MATT: Vex?

1606
01:43:54,254 --> 01:43:55,753
LAURA: 25.

1607
01:43:55,753 --> 01:43:57,035
LIAM: 37.

1608
01:43:57,035 --> 01:43:58,793
MATT: Pike is more stealthy than Vex right now!

1609
01:43:58,793 --> 01:44:00,391
LAURA: It's because Percy's holding on to my
waist.

1610
01:44:00,391 --> 01:44:01,814
MATT: I understand. Keyleth?

1611
01:44:01,814 --> 01:44:02,812
MARISHA: 26.

1612
01:44:02,812 --> 01:44:03,933
TALIESIN: 21.

1613
01:44:03,933 --> 01:44:05,168
JON: 28.

1614
01:44:05,168 --> 01:44:16,708
SAM: Scanlan got 29, Taryon got 25, and Doty got a
two, but with his boots--

1615
01:44:16,708 --> 01:44:19,093
what do his boots do? Shit!

1616
01:44:19,093 --> 01:44:21,084
MATT: The boots give him advantage on stealth
checks. He gets to roll again.

1617
01:44:21,084 --> 01:44:24,677
SAM: Okay. 17! Plus ten, yeah.

1618
01:44:24,677 --> 01:44:31,385
MATT: There you go. So you guys silently make your
way in. I would like a marching order on this,

1619
01:44:31,385 --> 01:44:36,848
because it is about ten feet wide, this tunnel,
and you guys can only go in there two at a time,

1620
01:44:36,848 --> 01:44:37,975
shoulder-to-shoulder.

1621
01:44:37,975 --> 01:44:40,058
TALIESIN: Who's got the best night vision?

1622
01:44:40,058 --> 01:44:46,093
LAURA: Actually, Doty has the best night vision.
He's got complete Darkvision? Oh, we all have

1623
01:44:46,093 --> 01:44:47,638
Darkvision.

1624
01:44:47,638 --> 01:44:49,645
MATT: Okay, so Vax and Pike in the front.

1625
01:44:49,645 --> 01:44:54,955
LIAM: Check for traps, check for traps, check for
traps.

1626
01:44:54,955 --> 01:44:59,634
LAURA: We didn't take a nap.

1627
01:44:59,634 --> 01:45:03,293
SAM: Do you want to stop and camp?

1628
01:45:03,293 --> 01:45:04,884
LAURA: Maybe in a little bit.

1629
01:45:04,884 --> 01:45:08,601
TALIESIN: I'm all right with the notion of getting
a little deeper in.

1630
01:45:08,601 --> 01:45:12,334
MATT: All right, so. Pike and Vax at the front.
All right. Who's after them?

1631
01:45:12,334 --> 01:45:14,816
LAURA: Me and Percy.

1632
01:45:14,816 --> 01:45:18,039
ASHLEY: I tug on Vax's shirt just to let him know
I'm there.

1633
01:45:18,039 --> 01:45:22,350
SAM: I feel like good old Chod should be near the
tip of the spear since he knows the inside of this

1634
01:45:22,350 --> 01:45:23,789
place a bit.

1635
01:45:23,789 --> 01:45:25,536
LAURA: That's true. What did he roll for stealth?

1636
01:45:25,536 --> 01:45:27,182
MATT: He rolled a 28 I think.

1637
01:45:27,182 --> 01:45:28,562
JON: Have I been in this area?

1638
01:45:28,562 --> 01:45:31,802
MATT: You have not been in this specific tunnel.
You haven't seen anything that looks familiar. The

1639
01:45:31,802 --> 01:45:35,420
path you went before was a natural cavern. This
one is pushed straight through.

1640
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:41,260
JON: Yeah. But I can see how, I'm the only one
who's been in this mountain, so there's maybe a

1641
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:45,173
little trust. I got this! I haven't been here, but
I got it!

1642
01:45:45,173 --> 01:45:47,339
MATT: All right, so do you push your way towards
the front?

1643
01:45:47,339 --> 01:45:48,448
JON: Sure.

1644
01:45:48,448 --> 01:45:52,421
MATT: All right. So, Pike and Vax, as you guys are
moving forward, your bardbarian friend pushes

1645
01:45:52,421 --> 01:45:56,076
aside and muscles up to become the point at the
tip of the sphere.

1646
01:45:56,076 --> 01:45:59,029
JON: I crop-dust all of you as I go in front of
you.

1647
01:45:59,029 --> 01:46:04,403
MATT: After that, after Percy and Vex?

1648
01:46:04,403 --> 01:46:06,263
MARISHA: I'll go.

1649
01:46:06,263 --> 01:46:11,256
MATT: All right. Keyleth, and we still have
Taryon, Scanlan...

1650
01:46:11,256 --> 01:46:13,835
SAM: Taryon next, with Doty with him.

1651
01:46:13,835 --> 01:46:20,801
MATT: Taryon with Doty behind. Doty is going to be
two people in the cavern. So who's behind Doty?

1652
01:46:20,801 --> 01:46:22,103
TRAVIS: Me.

1653
01:46:22,103 --> 01:46:24,088
MATT: All right, Grog. And...

1654
01:46:24,088 --> 01:46:26,559
SAM: Scanlan will be in the rear.

1655
01:46:26,559 --> 01:46:29,618
MATT: All right, so Scanlan is alongside Grog. I
imagine you have Trinket in your necklace?

1656
01:46:29,618 --> 01:46:30,835
LAURA: Yes.

1657
01:46:30,835 --> 01:46:35,081
MATT: All right. So at the very end, Grog, you're
walking, and Scanlan's there at your side, and

1658
01:46:35,081 --> 01:46:39,213
Doty walking in front of you, lumbering,
surprisingly quiet. And you get the sense the

1659
01:46:39,213 --> 01:46:43,921
reason you're so stealthy in here is because as
you step, it's soft. It's like stepping on a bunch

1660
01:46:43,921 --> 01:46:49,447
of very, very fine powder. (heavy footsteps) It
helps cushion your footfalls.

1661
01:46:49,447 --> 01:46:53,084
MARISHA: Like snow? Or ash?

1662
01:46:53,084 --> 01:46:55,588
MATT: Like ash, almost. Like a very, very fine
dust.

1663
01:46:55,588 --> 01:47:00,569
MARISHA: Can I dip down and grab a bit of it and
do a nature check on it? Is it ash?

1664
01:47:00,569 --> 01:47:02,716
MATT: Sure, make a nature check.

1665
01:47:02,716 --> 01:47:04,544
LAURA: It's cocaine!

1666
01:47:04,544 --> 01:47:10,418
MATT: First she eats the soul, then she just does
a line in the middle of the tunnel. Keyleth's gone

1667
01:47:10,418 --> 01:47:12,144
off the end, it's really bad.

1668
01:47:12,144 --> 01:47:13,149
MARISHA: 15.

1669
01:47:13,149 --> 01:47:20,328
MATT: 15's not too bad. You taste it, and you
smell it. It's not ash. It's very, very, very fine

1670
01:47:20,328 --> 01:47:23,606
powder. It has an earthy rock taste to it.

1671
01:47:23,606 --> 01:47:27,248
LIAM: And are there any tracks or footprints ahead
of Pike and I?

1672
01:47:27,248 --> 01:47:29,539
MATT: Make a survival check.

1673
01:47:29,539 --> 01:47:34,564
LIAM: Survival. Ooh, that's good. 19.

1674
01:47:34,564 --> 01:47:38,515
MATT: 19. You do see some tracks stepping up and
down, yes.

1675
01:47:38,515 --> 01:47:39,645
LIAM: Both ways?

1676
01:47:39,645 --> 01:47:40,834
MATT: Both ways.

1677
01:47:40,834 --> 01:47:42,069
LIAM: Shite.

1678
01:47:42,069 --> 01:47:46,075
MATT: All right. So pushing forward, another 30 or
40 feet, roll another investigation check.

1679
01:47:46,075 --> 01:47:47,994
LIAM: Not perception?

1680
01:47:47,994 --> 01:47:51,911
MATT: Not for checking for traps, man, it's
investigation. Always been.

1681
01:47:51,911 --> 01:47:53,181
LIAM: 21.

1682
01:47:53,181 --> 01:47:54,800
MATT: 21, okay.

1683
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:58,559
SAM: Fine, if Matt wants to change the rules 100
games in, I guess so.

1684
01:47:58,559 --> 01:48:03,212
MATT: All right, so you continue moving forward.
You do not see any traps, anything that catches

1685
01:48:03,212 --> 01:48:04,479
your attention.

1686
01:48:04,479 --> 01:48:09,670
MARISHA: Can I just do a little, I'm going to
scoop up a little bit and say, Percy, can I get a

1687
01:48:09,670 --> 01:48:13,553
little bit of water added onto this? Can I do
another nature check on what this is?

1688
01:48:13,553 --> 01:48:15,891
TRAVIS: You are fucking fascinated with the god
damn ash.

1689
01:48:15,891 --> 01:48:19,787
MATT: I'm not going to tell you to make another
nature check. You can't keep making rolls until

1690
01:48:19,787 --> 01:48:25,918
you get a better one. It turns into an immediate
mud. It's a very, very fine silt, almost.

1691
01:48:25,918 --> 01:48:28,460
TALIESIN: What color is the rock?

1692
01:48:28,460 --> 01:48:30,056
MATT: The powder, you mean?

1693
01:48:30,056 --> 01:48:32,046
TALIESIN: I can't see anything, can I? Never
mind.

1694
01:48:32,046 --> 01:48:35,128
MATT: You can see nothing. In fact, when you say,
"Percy, get some water on this," you're like,

1695
01:48:35,128 --> 01:48:38,672
"What? I don't-- where?" You have to guide his
hand.

1696
01:48:38,672 --> 01:48:41,028
LIAM: And is it dead silent in here?

1697
01:48:41,028 --> 01:48:44,417
MATT: It's dead quiet from where you currently
are. You can make a perception check to listen in

1698
01:48:44,417 --> 01:48:46,235
to see if you hear anything ahead.

1699
01:48:46,235 --> 01:48:48,576
LIAM: 24.

1700
01:48:48,576 --> 01:48:58,103
MATT: 24. You listen carefully and you hear faint
sounds of footsteps and scraping stone. In one

1701
01:48:58,103 --> 01:49:03,867
little, sounds like a (whistle), like a brief
sucking sound, and that's it.

1702
01:49:03,867 --> 01:49:15,604
LIAM: Over the earring, not alone. Not alone.
Something up ahead. I don't think we're camping.

1703
01:49:15,604 --> 01:49:24,708
LAURA: If we camp, then they won't find us. They
can't see the door.

1704
01:49:24,708 --> 01:49:31,618
LIAM: What do y'all want to do?

1705
01:49:31,618 --> 01:49:34,035
TRAVIS: You're on point. Keep going.

1706
01:49:34,035 --> 01:49:38,422
ASHLEY: I say we keep going. If it's an emergency,
we can all jump into the mansion, maybe.

1707
01:49:38,422 --> 01:49:42,039
TALIESIN: I'll activate my boots.

1708
01:49:42,039 --> 01:49:44,067
ASHLEY: Is everybody okay to keep going?

1709
01:49:44,067 --> 01:49:50,525
MATT: Okay. You continue another 40, 50 feet down
the path. Make another investigation check.

1710
01:49:50,525 --> 01:49:54,620
LIAM: Natural 20.

1711
01:49:54,620 --> 01:50:03,197
MATT: You go a little further ahead and you come
upon what appears to be two more of those faces,

1712
01:50:03,197 --> 01:50:09,224
that are facing the inside of the wall maybe 30
feet ahead. And you stop. You can see they're both

1713
01:50:09,224 --> 01:50:12,075
facing outward, towards the center of the
hallway.

1714
01:50:12,075 --> 01:50:22,260
LIAM: Kiki, a couple more faces. Can you shimmy
your way up here, please?

1715
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:27,849
MARISHA: I get down on my hands and elbows.

1716
01:50:27,849 --> 01:50:32,562
LAURA: Percy, spread your legs! I let her crawl
through us.

1717
01:50:32,562 --> 01:50:34,455
LIAM: Left hand green!

1718
01:50:34,455 --> 01:50:36,825
MARISHA: Where are they?

1719
01:50:36,825 --> 01:50:43,033
LIAM: Right over there, right up ahead, 30 feet.
Both sides.

1720
01:50:43,033 --> 01:50:47,942
MATT: He points it out to you, and you can just
barely see the smooth walls, the almost oval,

1721
01:50:47,942 --> 01:50:55,499
circular passageway, you can see the slight lift
of the side rock where the faces

1722
01:50:55,499 --> 01:50:57,696
form a very faint profile.

1723
01:50:57,696 --> 01:51:06,931
MARISHA: I scootch a few more inches and use my
last two 3rd-level spells.

1724
01:51:06,931 --> 01:51:10,610
MATT: Okay. Roll a d20. Add your wisdom modifier,
please.

1725
01:51:10,610 --> 01:51:12,538
MARISHA: Just my straight modifier?

1726
01:51:12,538 --> 01:51:14,010
MATT: Yep.

1727
01:51:14,010 --> 01:51:19,751
MARISHA: Don't fuck me Gil! Okay, that's good,
that's good. 19 on the first one.

1728
01:51:19,751 --> 01:51:21,745
MATT: Okay, roll again on the second one.

1729
01:51:21,745 --> 01:51:25,658
MARISHA: 18 on the second one.

1730
01:51:25,658 --> 01:51:32,944
MATT: Okay. As you take a moment (whoosh), the
first one releases, and you watch as the face

1731
01:51:32,944 --> 01:51:40,507
suddenly begins to glow with this dull, grayish,
black crackling energy, and then (poof). The

1732
01:51:40,507 --> 01:51:47,651
energy seems to vanish and disperse, with the one
on the left. You turn and release Dispel Magic on

1733
01:51:47,651 --> 01:51:51,779
the one on the right, and you watch as the same
effect happens. (poof) Disperses as well.

1734
01:51:51,779 --> 01:51:55,316
MARISHA: Okay, we're good!

1735
01:51:55,316 --> 01:52:04,144
LAURA: (sings) You're the best around! Okay, keep
going forward.

1736
01:52:04,144 --> 01:52:10,703
LIAM: Grab her shoulder, move slowly past, pull
Pickle along, and continue to carefully search.

1737
01:52:10,703 --> 01:52:16,858
MATT: Okay. As you approach and step toward the
space right between where the two faces are, you

1738
01:52:16,858 --> 01:52:22,168
make one footfall between the two of them, and
nothing happens.

1739
01:52:22,168 --> 01:52:23,960
You successfully dispelled the effect.

1740
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:25,386
ASHLEY: You sneaky.

1741
01:52:25,386 --> 01:52:36,221
MATT: Wanted to fuck with you. You continue
pushing forward for another 50 or so feet. You're

1742
01:52:36,221 --> 01:52:40,187
starting to get fairly close at this point to
where the arrow may have dropped.

1743
01:52:40,187 --> 01:52:45,033
LAURA: Oh, shit, you were right by fucking other
faces when you popped in before!

1744
01:52:45,033 --> 01:52:48,744
MATT: You moved just a little bit beyond them.
Make another investigation check. You're not there

1745
01:52:48,744 --> 01:52:50,267
yet, but you're getting closer.

1746
01:52:50,267 --> 01:52:53,620
LIAM: 18.

1747
01:52:53,620 --> 01:52:59,003
MATT: 18, okay. You don't seem to notice any
strange or different elements of the topography

1748
01:52:59,003 --> 01:53:03,367
that worry you. You push on for another 40, 50
feet or so, and you're just now on the cusp of

1749
01:53:03,367 --> 01:53:05,999
where the arrow dropped. Make another
investigation check.

1750
01:53:05,999 --> 01:53:08,831
LAURA: Roll super good.

1751
01:53:08,831 --> 01:53:16,374
LIAM: That's at least an 18. Oh, it's better than
18. It is 26.

1752
01:53:16,374 --> 01:53:23,195
MATT: Okay. You don't notice any traps or any
issues in the vicinity. You do see the footprints

1753
01:53:23,195 --> 01:53:29,325
of Pike and Scanlan where they first arrived
earlier before, venturing into this cavern, and

1754
01:53:29,325 --> 01:53:34,084
pushing forward about 20 or so feet, the smooth
cavern begins to turn into more of a natural,

1755
01:53:34,084 --> 01:53:41,745
almost a volcanic tube-type physicality to it, and
you can see to the left, another tunnel merges

1756
01:53:41,745 --> 01:53:46,638
with it. You begin to recognize this. It looks
like this carved tunnel is now dovetailing into

1757
01:53:46,638 --> 01:53:53,586
the path that you guys found your way in, the one
that was collapsed on the exit. Now the path that

1758
01:53:53,586 --> 01:53:56,896
you know and the path you're traversing have
finally merged into one singular path.

1759
01:53:56,896 --> 01:54:02,224
JON: I know this place, you guys! Let's go down
the left one.

1760
01:54:02,224 --> 01:54:03,496
LAURA: Shh!

1761
01:54:03,496 --> 01:54:05,845
TALIESIN: Left?

1762
01:54:05,845 --> 01:54:12,249
JON: Yeah. There's one that's-- we can either go
straight, or there's one at the...

1763
01:54:12,249 --> 01:54:15,248
MATT: The one that's on the left will lead you
back to the entrance where you first came in, but

1764
01:54:15,248 --> 01:54:18,236
it was collapsed, the one that you knew. If you
keep going straight, it'll lead you towards the

1765
01:54:18,236 --> 01:54:20,522
light and where you saw these people last time you
were here.

1766
01:54:20,522 --> 01:54:26,859
JON: If we go left, it's going to take us back the
other way, so that's safe, but we could keep going

1767
01:54:26,859 --> 01:54:28,884
straight where the light is.

1768
01:54:28,884 --> 01:54:32,332
LIAM: We're here for your friends, right?

1769
01:54:32,332 --> 01:54:35,198
JON: Yeah, they might still be alive. And I call
out, hello?

1770
01:54:35,198 --> 01:54:45,061
MATT: Okay. It echoes. "Hello?" Everyone make a
perception check.

1771
01:54:45,061 --> 01:54:52,971
SAM: Right now I'm looking at the back of Grog's
ass. But I got a 19.

1772
01:54:52,971 --> 01:54:54,734
MARISHA: Natural 19.

1773
01:54:54,734 --> 01:54:56,191
TRAVIS: 10.

1774
01:54:56,191 --> 01:54:57,925
ASHLEY: 22.

1775
01:54:57,925 --> 01:54:59,851
LAURA: 22.

1776
01:54:59,851 --> 01:55:01,603
JON: 21.

1777
01:55:01,603 --> 01:55:03,810
TALIESIN: 13.

1778
01:55:03,810 --> 01:55:05,710
MATT: 19, you got, right?

1779
01:55:05,710 --> 01:55:08,648
MARISHA: Yeah. That's a 34 total.

1780
01:55:08,648 --> 01:55:10,758
LIAM: 32.

1781
01:55:10,758 --> 01:55:20,171
MATT: All right. Everyone over 20, you listen and
you can hear very faint voices (whispering), and

1782
01:55:20,171 --> 01:55:22,946
it sounds like movement moving quicker.

1783
01:55:22,946 --> 01:55:26,130
LAURA: Scanlan? Maybe now is the time for that
door.

1784
01:55:26,130 --> 01:55:28,684
SAM: For the door? The mansion?

1785
01:55:28,684 --> 01:55:29,872
LAURA: Yeah.

1786
01:55:29,872 --> 01:55:32,935
SAM: Okay. It takes a minute to cast.

1787
01:55:32,935 --> 01:55:35,808
LIAM: That's not going to work. We've got company
coming.

1788
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:37,653
LAURA: How near do the voices sound?

1789
01:55:37,653 --> 01:55:40,922
MATT: They don't sound like they're getting
louder. Doesn't sound like they're getting closer,

1790
01:55:40,922 --> 01:55:42,317
you just hear voices.

1791
01:55:42,317 --> 01:55:43,614
SAM: Do you want me to?

1792
01:55:43,614 --> 01:55:47,749
LAURA: Let's backtrack to the caved-in tunnel.

1793
01:55:47,749 --> 01:55:49,671
JON: Maybe it's my friends. Should we go?

1794
01:55:49,671 --> 01:55:53,769
LAURA: No. Let's backtrack to the caved-in tunnel
and set up the door.

1795
01:55:53,769 --> 01:55:56,884
MARISHA: You guys go. I'll wait here just in
case.

1796
01:55:56,884 --> 01:55:58,415
JON: I'll stay with you.

1797
01:55:58,415 --> 01:56:00,152
TALIESIN: Be quiet.

1798
01:56:00,152 --> 01:56:03,351
MATT: Okay. You guys make your way towards the
caved-in entrance.

1799
01:56:03,351 --> 01:56:09,564
TALIESIN: I'll stay with the two of you because I
can't see shit and I'll slow you down. If things

1800
01:56:09,564 --> 01:56:11,553
happen, they're going to light up. It'll be all
right.

1801
01:56:11,553 --> 01:56:17,036
MATT: Okay. So you guys make your way back to the
entranceway.

1802
01:56:17,036 --> 01:56:19,565
LIAM: I actually stay halfway between both.

1803
01:56:19,565 --> 01:56:24,852
MATT: You stay halfway between, okay. It's roughly
about 150, 200 feet this direction. It's a

1804
01:56:24,852 --> 01:56:30,448
shallower cavern to this area than the one you
came through. It's a longer way in, but you manage

1805
01:56:30,448 --> 01:56:36,285
to find the other end of this cave-in. It's rocks
that have tumbled in and clustered. Keyleth, you

1806
01:56:36,285 --> 01:56:43,206
glance over and you see shapes moving in the
light, and as you glance up ahead, about 30 feet

1807
01:56:43,206 --> 01:56:46,506
ahead of you, you see six figures heading your
direction. Humanoid.

1808
01:56:46,506 --> 01:56:51,881
SAM: That's 100,000 dollars, yo. Six figures,
moving your direction!

1809
01:56:51,881 --> 01:57:05,575
MARISHA: Holy shit, a brand new Tesla is coming
this way! Okay. Hey, we have people. We have

1810
01:57:05,575 --> 01:57:10,124
people coming this way, about six of them. Just
letting you know, probably going to be some

1811
01:57:10,124 --> 01:57:14,686
fighting coming up, and that is your update from
the Voice of the Tempest.

1812
01:57:14,686 --> 01:57:17,132
LIAM: I'm creeping back.

1813
01:57:17,132 --> 01:57:20,981
MATT: All right. So you go ahead and you meet up
with Keyleth. The rest of you are back by the

1814
01:57:20,981 --> 01:57:23,166
doorway. Scanlan, you're taking a minute to cast
this?

1815
01:57:23,166 --> 01:57:25,018
SAM: I mean, you told me to do this, right?

1816
01:57:25,018 --> 01:57:28,146
LAURA: I thought we were not going to fight, but
it's up to everybody else.

1817
01:57:28,146 --> 01:57:30,818
TALIESIN: We may need a place to disappear to, so
yes.

1818
01:57:30,818 --> 01:57:33,000
MARISHA: It's not a bad idea. We can hold them
off.

1819
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:37,333
SAM: Okay. I'm out of the fight, then. So I'll
start casting and singing.

1820
01:57:37,333 --> 01:57:40,533
MATT: Okay, so Scanlan begins working on casting
the magnificent--

1821
01:57:40,533 --> 01:57:47,174
SAM: (sings) When people keep repeating that you
need a place to sleep, when everybody starts

1822
01:57:47,174 --> 01:57:57,495
retreating but you need a really cool keep, let
Scanlan open the door. Let Scanlan open the door!

1823
01:57:57,495 --> 01:58:02,615
Let Scanlan open the door to your house!

1824
01:58:02,615 --> 01:58:05,307
MATT: So as this is commencing-- Oh, I've missed
that.

1825
01:58:05,307 --> 01:58:09,819
JON: I've never heard music. I want to stay back
with him. No, I'm kidding, I want to stay. I'm

1826
01:58:09,819 --> 01:58:11,393
still with her.

1827
01:58:11,393 --> 01:58:16,871
MATT: All right, so we have Lionel, Keyleth, and
eventually Vax, and the rest of you are still back

1828
01:58:16,871 --> 01:58:17,849
at the entranceway.

1829
01:58:17,849 --> 01:58:18,854
MARISHA: And Percy.

1830
01:58:18,854 --> 01:58:19,869
MATT: Oh, Percy's there.

1831
01:58:19,869 --> 01:58:21,658
LAURA: I'm going to stand at the entrance of the
tunnel and guard Scanlan.

1832
01:58:21,658 --> 01:58:24,513
MATT: Okay. Keyleth, you keep an eye out and you
watch as they approach. They're in a sprint, a

1833
01:58:24,513 --> 01:58:29,030
wild sprint. You notice the humanoid figures,
there's a lot of clacking sounds, and you

1834
01:58:29,030 --> 01:58:33,794
immediately notice they're thinner than a
fleshed-out human. These are skeletal. They are

1835
01:58:33,794 --> 01:58:39,597
skeletons in armor with shields and weapons, and
they're (snarling) scattering through the hallway

1836
01:58:39,597 --> 01:58:41,631
towards you at a very fast pace.

1837
01:58:41,631 --> 01:58:48,166
MARISHA: I'm just going to say, Pike? Pike, I
think we've got some undead coming our way.

1838
01:58:48,166 --> 01:58:51,564
Probably going to need some Divine Smiting.

1839
01:58:51,564 --> 01:58:53,206
ASHLEY: Coming right up.

1840
01:58:53,206 --> 01:58:56,171
MATT: Pike's little legs start making her way.
It's going to take you a while to get there.

1841
01:58:56,171 --> 01:59:02,221
MARISHA: As I call Pike, I'm going to go ahead and be
like, here we go. (boom).

1842
01:59:02,382 --> 01:59:03,420
MATT: What do you do?

1843
01:59:03,420 --> 01:59:04,623
MARISHA: Fireball.

1844
01:59:04,623 --> 01:59:05,962
MATT: A Fireball!

1845
01:59:05,962 --> 01:59:07,839
MARISHA: I can see them, right? They're close
enough?

1846
01:59:07,839 --> 01:59:09,820
MATT: For a Fireball, most definitely.

1847
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:12,156
MARISHA: Okay. Out of the spire.

1848
01:59:12,156 --> 01:59:16,084
MATT: So. Keyleth, I want you to go ahead and
roll your damage.

1849
01:59:16,084 --> 01:59:25,746
MARISHA: Okay. Fireball is... Hang on, wait, I'm
not a sorcerer. I should've had this prepared. I

1850
01:59:25,917 --> 01:59:39,160
admit I should've had this. It's something d8?
d10's? Fireball. 8d6 fire damage.

1851
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:41,618
MATT: One of them rolled a natural 20.

1852
01:59:41,618 --> 01:59:45,615
MARISHA: One, two, three, four, five, six, give me
two more.

1853
01:59:45,615 --> 01:59:48,468
MATT: That was a 19 and a 20.

1854
01:59:48,468 --> 01:59:53,353
MARISHA: A 19 and a 20? That's a lot.

1855
01:59:53,353 --> 01:59:55,197
MATT: Your spell DC is what, 21?

1856
01:59:55,197 --> 01:59:57,306
MARISHA: 21, yeah.

1857
01:59:57,306 --> 01:59:59,177
MATT: All right, so two of them make their save.

1858
01:59:59,177 --> 02:00:00,974
TALIESIN: You re-roll.

1859
02:00:00,974 --> 02:00:13,283
MARISHA: I reroll ones. (counting) 34 damage.

1860
02:00:13,283 --> 02:00:18,959
MATT: 34 damage. All right. You watch as four of
these skeletons explode, their bones detonating

1861
02:00:18,959 --> 02:00:25,536
and exploding all over the cavern. You watch as it
bounces around and breaks and shatters, and you

1862
02:00:25,536 --> 02:00:29,661
hear them all clattering into the dust below. Two
more push through the flames. You can see the

1863
02:00:29,661 --> 02:00:33,820
armor, the leather they have on is now burning
behind them and is causing this glow in the alley.

1864
02:00:33,820 --> 02:00:34,988
You see this, Percy.

1865
02:00:34,988 --> 02:00:36,443
TALIESIN: How loud was this Fireball?

1866
02:00:36,443 --> 02:00:38,067
MATT: It was pretty loud. It's a Fireball.

1867
02:00:38,067 --> 02:00:39,555
TALIESIN: I'll take two shots at the two that came
through.

1868
02:00:39,555 --> 02:00:40,651
MATT: Okay.

1869
02:00:40,651 --> 02:00:41,961
MARISHA: We're here.

1870
02:00:41,961 --> 02:00:44,858
TALIESIN: I'm going to curl up to the top and
upside-down, take two shots.

1871
02:00:44,858 --> 02:00:45,893
MATT: Okay.

1872
02:00:45,893 --> 02:00:47,531
JON: This is with your rifle?

1873
02:00:47,531 --> 02:00:56,059
TALIESIN: Yeah, with my big rifle. That's not bad.
A 20 and a 27 to hit.

1874
02:00:56,059 --> 02:00:57,010
MATT: Both hit.

1875
02:00:57,010 --> 02:00:58,761
TALIESIN: Actually, even more than that.

1876
02:00:58,761 --> 02:01:02,567
MATT: Don't even worry about rolling damage
because even your minimum damage, with what damage

1877
02:01:02,567 --> 02:01:06,572
they'd taken from the Fireball? Both shots, you
hit them both in the ribcage, in the sternum and

1878
02:01:06,572 --> 02:01:11,598
the back of the spinal column and they fold into
themselves and crumple into spinning pieces of

1879
02:01:11,598 --> 02:01:16,619
bone. You watch as the momentum of their movement
causes them to scatter across the dust. Both of

1880
02:01:16,619 --> 02:01:18,128
them. (gunshots)

1881
02:01:18,128 --> 02:01:22,756
MARISHA: Hey, Pike? Hold that order for that
divine smiting. We're going to need it probably in

1882
02:01:22,756 --> 02:01:24,138
a second.

1883
02:01:24,138 --> 02:01:26,545
ASHLEY: I'm here. Did you save any for me?

1884
02:01:26,545 --> 02:01:28,289
TALIESIN: There will be more.

1885
02:01:28,289 --> 02:01:30,491
MARISHA: I think there's going to be more.

1886
02:01:30,491 --> 02:01:32,124
ASHLEY: I take out my mace and get ready.

1887
02:01:32,124 --> 02:01:33,593
JON: I want some now.

1888
02:01:33,593 --> 02:01:42,443
MATT: All right, as you guys are waiting there...
30 seconds passes. 30 seconds pass. Scanlan, you

1889
02:01:42,443 --> 02:01:47,614
finish your spell. The doorway appears up. There
doesn't appear to be anything else currently

1890
02:01:47,614 --> 02:01:49,429
coming down the hall after you.

1891
02:01:49,429 --> 02:01:51,737
LAURA: (singing) Scanlan, open the door.

1892
02:01:51,737 --> 02:01:54,574
MARISHA: (singing) Scanlan, open the door.

1893
02:01:54,574 --> 02:01:57,324
TRAVIS: We going in or what?

1894
02:01:57,324 --> 02:01:59,260
LAURA: You guys want to camp? Let's go.

1895
02:01:59,260 --> 02:02:03,500
TALIESIN: Can we leave something here? Is there
some sort of alarm that we can set?

1896
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:04,819
LAURA: Like a glyph?

1897
02:02:04,819 --> 02:02:06,889
ASHLEY: A Glyph of Warding?

1898
02:02:06,889 --> 02:02:08,801
TALIESIN: Like a Glyph of Warding.

1899
02:02:08,801 --> 02:02:09,548
ASHLEY: Yes, we can.

1900
02:02:09,548 --> 02:02:12,837
JON: Can you put it on the faces that already
exist so that they think--

1901
02:02:12,837 --> 02:02:17,316
ASHLEY: Ooh. Chod!

1902
02:02:17,316 --> 02:02:19,797
SAM: And an idiot shall lead them.

1903
02:02:19,797 --> 02:02:21,596
JON: What's an idiot?

1904
02:02:21,596 --> 02:02:24,488
LIAM: Broken clock. Twice a day. Well done.

1905
02:02:24,488 --> 02:02:26,958
TALIESIN: Let's take a long rest and see if we can
get two more.

1906
02:02:26,958 --> 02:02:33,928
MATT: You do notice, Keyleth, that the flickering
light, the firelight, is getting brighter. The

1907
02:02:33,928 --> 02:02:37,985
firelight is now becoming more of a white light,
and it's a flickering white light.

1908
02:02:37,985 --> 02:02:44,841
MARISHA: How hot does a campfire normally get? Not
that hot, right?

1909
02:02:44,841 --> 02:02:46,844
LAURA: Not that hot.

1910
02:02:46,844 --> 02:02:55,655
MARISHA: Oh no. Something bad. Hey, Pike? Fire.
Fire is very white. White fire.

1911
02:02:55,655 --> 02:02:57,852
ASHLEY: Huh.

1912
02:02:57,852 --> 02:03:01,382
LAURA: Feel like coming to the campsite? Maybe?

1913
02:03:01,382 --> 02:03:03,020
TALIESIN: Let's start backing up.

1914
02:03:03,020 --> 02:03:04,516
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Okay.

1915
02:03:04,516 --> 02:03:06,472
MARISHA: Back up a little bit.

1916
02:03:06,472 --> 02:03:10,453
ASHLEY: Are we close to the faces at all, still?

1917
02:03:10,453 --> 02:03:14,333
MATT: You're maybe about 70 to 100 feet.

1918
02:03:14,333 --> 02:03:15,667
ASHLEY: On the way back?

1919
02:03:15,667 --> 02:03:18,620
MATT: You're backing up through a different
tunnel, so there's no faces

1920
02:03:18,620 --> 02:03:20,165
that you've seen on this side.

1921
02:03:20,165 --> 02:03:26,304
TALIESIN: Let's leave it at the shift, so if they
go up our tunnel, we'll know.

1922
02:03:26,304 --> 02:03:28,953
ASHLEY: Great. I throw up a Glyph of Warding right
there.

1923
02:03:28,953 --> 02:03:31,114
MATT: Glyph of Warding. What's the casting time on
the glyph?

1924
02:03:31,114 --> 02:03:33,136
ASHLEY: A gift for someone.

1925
02:03:33,136 --> 02:03:35,569
MATT: What's the casting time on the glyph?

1926
02:03:35,569 --> 02:03:40,105
SAM: A gif of cording.

1927
02:03:40,105 --> 02:03:41,599
MATT: Yes, that one.

1928
02:03:41,599 --> 02:03:43,193
LAURA: We can't find the card.

1929
02:03:43,193 --> 02:03:46,628
ASHLEY: Give me just one second. I don't know if
it slipped underneath.

1930
02:03:46,628 --> 02:03:48,960
SAM: Probably a minute.

1931
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:51,877
TALIESIN: Everything fun takes a minute.

1932
02:03:51,877 --> 02:03:55,696
MATT: All right. Glyph of Warding is one hour
casting time.

1933
02:03:55,696 --> 02:03:57,035
TALIESIN: Oh, never mind!

1934
02:03:57,035 --> 02:04:04,778
ASHLEY: You know what? We don't have time, so
maybe we can just hop into the mansion.

1935
02:04:04,778 --> 02:04:07,862
TALIESIN: Watch an episode of House of Cards, and
by then Glyph of Warding will be done?

1936
02:04:07,862 --> 02:04:10,307
LAURA: Keep an eye. Hop in the mansion?

1937
02:04:10,307 --> 02:04:12,208
TALIESIN: Let's hop in the mansion.

1938
02:04:12,208 --> 02:04:16,984
MATT: All right. You guys hop into the mansion.
You all make your way into the center of Scanlan's

1939
02:04:16,984 --> 02:04:21,214
magnificent mansion. Lionel, you step through this
weird sparkling purple doorway that wasn't there

1940
02:04:21,214 --> 02:04:25,673
before, and as you go through, the temperature
becomes very comfortable-warm. It's well-kept

1941
02:04:25,673 --> 02:04:32,798
inside. It's climate-controlled. There's these
beautiful marble pillars. There's this royal red

1942
02:04:32,798 --> 02:04:38,555
and gold carpet that spreads out over this dual
staircase that winds up to a second floor. It's a

1943
02:04:38,555 --> 02:04:43,409
gorgeous mansion. The interior's immaculately
designed, and you watch as about a dozen or so

1944
02:04:43,409 --> 02:04:47,971
spectral people suddenly float in with their arms
crossed and give a bow

1945
02:04:47,971 --> 02:04:50,036
and a nod to you as you arrive.

1946
02:04:50,036 --> 02:04:54,096
LAURA: Before we go in, will you throw down the
Dust of Tracelessness?

1947
02:04:54,096 --> 02:04:55,282
TRAVIS: No.

1948
02:04:55,282 --> 02:04:56,197
LAURA: Grog.

1949
02:04:56,197 --> 02:04:57,161
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1950
02:04:57,161 --> 02:04:58,218
(laughter)

1951
02:04:58,218 --> 02:05:00,903
MATT: All right. You guys are all inside the
mansion.

1952
02:05:00,903 --> 02:05:04,341
LAURA: Well. That was fun.

1953
02:05:04,341 --> 02:05:07,026
MARISHA: It's been a while. You've redecorated.

1954
02:05:07,026 --> 02:05:14,166
SAM: I put some new art pieces in here. They're
all counterfeit, but still good.

1955
02:05:14,166 --> 02:05:15,640
LIAM: How's the menu?

1956
02:05:15,640 --> 02:05:17,252
SAM: The menu's changed quite a bit.

1957
02:05:17,252 --> 02:05:18,969
TALIESIN: Oh, do tell.

1958
02:05:18,969 --> 02:05:26,557
SAM: Kaylie got sick of chicken about two weeks
in, so she's got me on this vegan thing. (sighs)

1959
02:05:26,557 --> 02:05:32,195
She says it'll make me last longer and feel
healthier and stuff.

1960
02:05:32,195 --> 02:05:33,511
LAURA: Last longer?

1961
02:05:33,511 --> 02:05:40,623
SAM: Well, you know. Live longer. She said all
that meat was probably bad for me, so it's all

1962
02:05:40,623 --> 02:05:42,545
salads now.

1963
02:05:42,701 --> 02:05:44,168
MARISHA: Only salads?

1964
02:05:44,168 --> 02:05:45,925
SAM: Yeah. Different kinds of salad.

1965
02:05:45,925 --> 02:05:47,399
LAURA: That's it? That's all they make, is salad?

1966
02:05:47,399 --> 02:05:50,233
SAM: That's what she told them to make, and that's
what they're making now.

1967
02:05:50,233 --> 02:05:52,605
LAURA: But you run the place.

1968
02:05:52,605 --> 02:05:58,973
SAM: Well, I don't want to cross her. She has me
on a diet, and I'm trying to stick to it. It will

1969
02:05:58,973 --> 02:06:01,155
be all salad.

1970
02:06:01,155 --> 02:06:02,957
TALIESIN: Is it more tasteful in here now?

1971
02:06:02,957 --> 02:06:04,249
SAM: Tasteful?

1972
02:06:04,249 --> 02:06:05,904
TALIESIN: Is it more tasteful in the mansion?

1973
02:06:05,904 --> 02:06:07,917
MATT: Is it more tasteful in the mansion? No, I
didn't think so.

1974
02:06:07,917 --> 02:06:10,362
LAURA: Is the picture still up that Pike
commissioned?

1975
02:06:10,362 --> 02:06:13,100
SAM: Yeah, sure. It's there.

1976
02:06:13,100 --> 02:06:15,936
TRAVIS: You didn't replace that?

1977
02:06:15,936 --> 02:06:23,911
SAM: Maybe we should all retire to our rooms for a
while and come back for dinner.

1978
02:06:23,911 --> 02:06:30,098
LAURA: Is Tary-- does he have his own room, as
well?

1979
02:06:30,098 --> 02:06:33,584
SAM: Oh, that's the fancy fellow you've brought
with you.

1980
02:06:33,584 --> 02:06:35,815
LAURA: Yeah. Tary, Scanlan. Scanlan, Tary.

1981
02:06:35,815 --> 02:06:37,106
SAM: The new Scanlan. Yeah, right.

1982
02:06:37,106 --> 02:06:38,446
TRAVIS: Tary, say hi.

1983
02:06:38,446 --> 02:06:44,698
SAM: Hello! I'm Taryon Darrington. I've been quite
pleased to spend some time with your friends for

1984
02:06:44,698 --> 02:06:51,859
the last year, and it's-- you have wonderful
friends. You should honor and cherish them. They

1985
02:06:51,859 --> 02:06:58,474
are the best people I've ever met in my life, and
this is a lovely home you have.

1986
02:06:58,474 --> 02:07:01,297
TRAVIS: Scanlan, don't be rude. Respond.

1987
02:07:01,297 --> 02:07:14,100
SAM: (sighs) It's nice to meet you, too. Thank you
for looking after my friends. I guess any friend

1988
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:19,732
of Vox Machina is a friend of mine. You can use
the downstairs. The basement room.

1989
02:07:19,732 --> 02:07:23,253
LAURA: Scanlan, you can add a room at a thought!

1990
02:07:23,253 --> 02:07:25,299
TALIESIN: He can have my room.

1991
02:07:25,299 --> 02:07:27,403
LAURA: He can have your room.

1992
02:07:27,403 --> 02:07:30,098
TALIESIN: That will be fine.

1993
02:07:30,098 --> 02:07:32,665
JON: Do you have any bunkbeds?

1994
02:07:32,665 --> 02:07:36,403
SAM: No. I don't have bunkbeds.

1995
02:07:36,403 --> 02:07:37,707
JON: Do you have a hammock?

1996
02:07:37,707 --> 02:07:42,744
SAM: No, I don't think I do, but there might be
some spare cots and stuff downstairs.

1997
02:07:42,744 --> 02:07:45,749
TRAVIS: Lionel, there is a war room down in the
bottom of this bitch.

1998
02:07:45,749 --> 02:07:47,066
JON: War room?

1999
02:07:47,066 --> 02:07:51,002
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's got all the things people like
you and me need. We're covered.

2000
02:07:51,002 --> 02:07:52,136
JON: Sweet.

2001
02:07:52,136 --> 02:07:54,606
TRAVIS: Sand pit, fighting dummies.

2002
02:07:54,606 --> 02:07:57,880
JON: Dibs on the sand pit.

2003
02:07:57,880 --> 02:07:59,079
TRAVIS: Shit.

2004
02:07:59,079 --> 02:08:00,847
(laughter)

2005
02:08:00,847 --> 02:08:05,501
JON: It'll make me feel like I'm at home.

2006
02:08:05,501 --> 02:08:08,383
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

2007
02:08:08,383 --> 02:08:11,565
ASHLEY: There's also the spa, right?

2008
02:08:11,565 --> 02:08:17,639
SAM: Yeah. It was destroyed but rebuilt. It's
lined with iron now,

2009
02:08:17,639 --> 02:08:19,634
in case there's an explosion.

2010
02:08:19,634 --> 02:08:21,752
LIAM: Wise.

2011
02:08:21,752 --> 02:08:23,633
SAM: Yeah.

2012
02:08:23,633 --> 02:08:28,024
MATT: Do you guys all scatter to your rooms for a
moment to take a rest?

2013
02:08:28,024 --> 02:08:29,790
LAURA: I guess so.

2014
02:08:29,790 --> 02:08:31,428
LIAM: Do you want to play some cards or
something?

2015
02:08:31,428 --> 02:08:33,177
SAM: Sure! That will be great.

2016
02:08:33,177 --> 02:08:35,395
LIAM: Want to go back to, what, your room?

2017
02:08:35,395 --> 02:08:38,464
SAM: That will be fine, yeah. Let's go.

2018
02:08:38,464 --> 02:08:44,839
MATT: All righty. You guys head back to Scanlan's
room? We're going to take a break here. We'll

2019
02:08:44,839 --> 02:08:49,468
return here and pick up from that exact moment
here, in just a few minutes. Real fast, we do have

2020
02:08:49,468 --> 02:08:59,304
a Wyrmwood giveaway. It is the black walnut
complete dice tower system and tabletop dice tray

2021
02:08:59,304 --> 02:09:01,519
with leather rolling surface.

2022
02:09:01,519 --> 02:09:03,598
LAURA: Should we open it and see what color that
is?

2023
02:09:03,598 --> 02:09:05,548
MATT: I'll open some of it. I'm not going to open
all of it.

2024
02:09:05,548 --> 02:09:07,194
LAURA: Just one, because it's all black walnut.

2025
02:09:07,194 --> 02:09:19,330
MATT: Black walnut is this really nice dark color.
The leather interior is really nice. This will be

2026
02:09:19,330 --> 02:09:29,942
going to the person who wins in the Twitch chat.
Enter the code "hundred." The word "hundred" is

2027
02:09:29,942 --> 02:09:33,195
the code for the evening. Put it in there. Good
luck to whoever wins, and we'll see you guys back

2028
02:09:33,195 --> 02:09:34,472
here in a few minutes.

2029
02:09:34,472 --> 02:09:36,078
(cheering)

2030
02:09:36,078 --> 02:31:40,908
[break]

2031
02:31:41,047 --> 02:31:44,412
MATT: And welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to
Critical Role. First and foremost, we have our

2032
02:31:44,412 --> 02:31:52,011
winner in the chat: AJSparks08, congratulations,
you won the fantastic Wyrmwood package. Denovo

2033
02:31:52,011 --> 02:31:55,162
will contact you shortly to get your address and
shipping information. Congratulations, on our

2034
02:31:55,162 --> 02:32:00,462
100th episode Wyrmwood giveaway! Also, it's come
to our attention that the chat room and the

2035
02:32:00,462 --> 02:32:05,186
Internet is convinced that this is not a real set
and we are apparently on a green screen, so I

2036
02:32:05,186 --> 02:32:13,546
wanted to show you guys how incredibly real this
-- no, I'm kidding, it's actually real. It's a

2037
02:32:13,546 --> 02:32:20,125
real set, it's actually here. It's a real set.

2038
02:32:20,125 --> 02:32:22,967
LAURA: Don't fuck up the wrinkles, they look so
good in the light!

2039
02:32:22,967 --> 02:32:28,968
MATT: But I do understand illusions are prominent
in magical realms, apparently.

2040
02:32:28,968 --> 02:32:32,556
TRAVIS: Because of the beautiful spot behind you,
can you give us one Vidal Sassoon wave of your--

2041
02:32:32,556 --> 02:32:34,114
LAURA: Yeah, because you have a backlight!

2042
02:32:34,114 --> 02:32:34,787
MATT: No.

2043
02:32:34,787 --> 02:32:36,571
LAURA: And a halo around you, because of the
shield!

2044
02:32:36,571 --> 02:32:39,450
TRAVIS: It's kind of magnificent. Yeah!

2045
02:32:39,450 --> 02:32:42,287
MATT: I hate you all so much.

2046
02:32:42,287 --> 02:32:44,476
LAURA: Now your hair is extra fluffy because you
did it.

2047
02:32:44,476 --> 02:32:48,404
MATT: God damn it. All right! Why do I listen to
these people?

2048
02:32:48,532 --> 02:32:51,098
SAM: Maybe he's born with it.

2049
02:32:51,098 --> 02:32:52,942
JON: Maybe it's--

2050
02:32:52,942 --> 02:32:59,807
MATT: "Tary?" All right, so leaving us back where
we left off, you guys had all scattered to your

2051
02:32:59,807 --> 02:33:04,191
various rooms in Scanlan's magnificent mansion.
Vax, you had gone off with Scanlan?

2052
02:33:04,191 --> 02:33:06,439
LIAM: Catch up, play cards.

2053
02:33:06,439 --> 02:33:09,366
MATT: All right, so you make your way to the
chambers.

2054
02:33:09,366 --> 02:33:13,896
LIAM: Boy, it is more extravagant in here than I
remember.

2055
02:33:13,896 --> 02:33:17,068
SAM: Well, to be fair, you hadn't spent a lot of
time in my room.

2056
02:33:17,068 --> 02:33:20,329
LIAM: No, but there was just one mirror on the
ceiling, and now there are three.

2057
02:33:20,329 --> 02:33:22,298
SAM: I need to get every angle, don't I?

2058
02:33:22,298 --> 02:33:26,265
LIAM: Yeah, that's weird. Do you want to play
cards?

2059
02:33:26,265 --> 02:33:29,347
SAM: Sure. Rummy gin? Gin rummy? Pinochle?

2060
02:33:29,347 --> 02:33:30,925
LIAM: Yeah, I'll pretend to know what those are.

2061
02:33:30,925 --> 02:33:32,335
SAM: Spades? Hearts?

2062
02:33:32,335 --> 02:33:33,748
LIAM: Let's do hearts.

2063
02:33:33,748 --> 02:33:36,878
SAM: Okay. I'll deal.

2064
02:33:36,878 --> 02:33:42,233
LIAM: Okay. No idea how to play this game. But Vax
does!

2065
02:33:42,233 --> 02:33:43,740
SAM: I will win.

2066
02:33:43,740 --> 02:33:47,555
LIAM: All right, so catch me up, man!

2067
02:33:47,555 --> 02:33:52,697
SAM: I mean, there's a lot to talk about in a
year. We--

2068
02:33:52,697 --> 02:33:58,435
LIAM: What happened in the beginning? What
happened right after you left?

2069
02:33:58,435 --> 02:34:00,102
First couple of weeks?

2070
02:34:00,102 --> 02:34:11,330
SAM: We went on sort of a walkabout. Me and Kaylie
went off to the woods, did some camping. We found

2071
02:34:11,330 --> 02:34:21,955
some travelers and sang to them, and told stories
like we do. Entertained some folks. Some nights

2072
02:34:21,955 --> 02:34:27,222
were spent alone, some nights in the company of
people who wandered by. We weren't too far away

2073
02:34:27,222 --> 02:34:28,725
from Whitestone.

2074
02:34:28,725 --> 02:34:31,242
LIAM: So how did you get to Marquet?

2075
02:34:31,242 --> 02:34:47,454
SAM: After about a month or two of being hobos, I
guess, she wanted to do something. You know,

2076
02:34:47,454 --> 02:34:56,223
anything. She was getting bored, she's young. So I
told her, I don't really have anywhere to go, but

2077
02:34:56,223 --> 02:35:03,945
I do know of two fuckfaces I have to get revenge
on. I asked her if she'd be interested in that,

2078
02:35:03,945 --> 02:35:15,918
and she said, fuck yeah! So she came down with me.
We got a boat, went across the sea, and we went

2079
02:35:15,918 --> 02:35:23,189
back to that casino. It was really the only piece
of unfinished business from our time together that

2080
02:35:23,189 --> 02:35:24,505
I had to deal with.

2081
02:35:24,505 --> 02:35:28,501
LIAM: And that somehow stumbled into all this?

2082
02:35:28,501 --> 02:35:40,529
SAM: Well, when I got my revenge on them, I
learned a bit about what they were up to. They

2083
02:35:40,529 --> 02:35:49,241
weren't really drug dealers. It's embarrassing,
but the drugs they sold me were not real. I know

2084
02:35:49,241 --> 02:35:54,025
that's hard to believe, but I was swindled by
them.

2085
02:35:54,025 --> 02:35:59,041
LIAM: That is hard to believe. I don't think it's
true.

2086
02:35:59,041 --> 02:36:01,978
SAM: It is true. They sold me a bunch of shit.

2087
02:36:01,978 --> 02:36:04,007
LIAM: Oh, surely not, no.

2088
02:36:04,007 --> 02:36:17,711
SAM: But they were in this other game, of selling
counterfeit stuff. So I did the thing that I knew

2089
02:36:17,711 --> 02:36:24,876
would hurt them most. I took away their
counterfeiter, and now he works for me. So I put

2090
02:36:24,876 --> 02:36:36,218
them out of business, and I put me into business.
And since then I've been doing that for a while,

2091
02:36:36,218 --> 02:36:39,482
and it turns out I'm very good at it.

2092
02:36:39,482 --> 02:36:42,048
LIAM: That actually is not surprising.

2093
02:36:42,048 --> 02:36:51,050
SAM: We don't try to swindle people who are
innocent. We started off by taking down-- well,

2094
02:36:51,050 --> 02:37:01,398
not taking down, but ripping off a few guys who
were corrupt officials in the city, and built from

2095
02:37:01,398 --> 02:37:06,715
there. It's not a big operation, if I can be
honest with you. It's just me and Kaylie

2096
02:37:06,715 --> 02:37:08,156
and a few other people.

2097
02:37:08,156 --> 02:37:11,206
LIAM: I mean, I'm not going to lie, I think it's
pretty cool.

2098
02:37:11,206 --> 02:37:19,723
SAM: Thank you. It is kind of cool. I have this
persona, and people know who it is, and when I go

2099
02:37:19,723 --> 02:37:22,618
places, they're scared of me a little bit.

2100
02:37:22,618 --> 02:37:26,888
LIAM: I mean, you did save a fucking continent,
you are scary.

2101
02:37:26,888 --> 02:37:28,772
SAM: That's true.

2102
02:37:28,772 --> 02:37:30,214
LIAM: It is true.

2103
02:37:30,214 --> 02:37:33,057
SAM: I helped, a bit.

2104
02:37:33,057 --> 02:37:37,768
LIAM: A bit? You've had a year to clear your head,
you think it was just a bit?

2105
02:37:37,768 --> 02:37:43,438
SAM: I don't know, maybe. We all did our part. We
all did our part!

2106
02:37:43,438 --> 02:37:47,735
LIAM: You know there are multiple times we'd all
be dead if it weren't for you. You know that. You

2107
02:37:47,735 --> 02:37:54,843
know that! And the same could be said for any of
us, that's true, but you take any one piece away,

2108
02:37:54,843 --> 02:37:58,871
and the tower falls. Jenga, man.

2109
02:37:58,871 --> 02:38:12,287
SAM: I don't know what that game is. But, I know,
I know. Listen, I did a lot of thinking over the

2110
02:38:12,287 --> 02:38:24,328
year, and I-- Yeah. I appreciate you all much more
now than I did, and I realize that you probably

2111
02:38:24,328 --> 02:38:33,326
appreciated me, too, but at the time I just didn't
know. I was so used to being a loner that I didn't

2112
02:38:33,326 --> 02:38:39,797
know really how to behave in a group, that's all.
So I left.

2113
02:38:39,797 --> 02:38:51,116
LIAM: You know, it was ugly, on all sides, when
you left, but I've always understood why you left.

2114
02:38:51,116 --> 02:38:52,607
I admire it.

2115
02:38:52,607 --> 02:38:54,350
SAM: Really?

2116
02:38:54,350 --> 02:39:11,607
LIAM: I wish my dad gave half as much effort as
you have this year. Or I used to. Anyway, you

2117
02:39:11,607 --> 02:39:14,557
know, we've missed you. Everybody has.

2118
02:39:14,557 --> 02:39:15,880
SAM: That's not true.

2119
02:39:15,880 --> 02:39:27,231
LIAM: It is true. And I certainly have, and if I
did anything or said anything to make you feel

2120
02:39:27,231 --> 02:39:33,778
lonely, I'm sorry. I really am. Fucking missed
you, man.

2121
02:39:33,778 --> 02:39:47,004
SAM: You don't have to apologize for anything. It
was me. It was me, and I don't know if we'll ever

2122
02:39:47,004 --> 02:40:00,495
have what we had before, but I can tell you that
fighting alongside you all was the best time of my

2123
02:40:00,495 --> 02:40:08,419
life, and not because of the glory, or the
fortune, or the fame that we got. It was just to

2124
02:40:08,419 --> 02:40:17,645
fight alongside you, and to see the looks on your
faces when I did something really cool in battle.

2125
02:40:17,645 --> 02:40:25,534
LIAM: Fucking every time. I know I miss that
flair.

2126
02:40:25,534 --> 02:40:31,272
SAM: But you've got this new guy, and he seems
really-- He's very handsome.

2127
02:40:31,272 --> 02:40:36,851
LIAM: Well, I don't know. Yeah, he's good looking.
That's true. I don't know that we have-- I mean,

2128
02:40:36,851 --> 02:40:39,920
we've scattered a bit. I live in Zephra now.

2129
02:40:39,920 --> 02:40:41,542
SAM: Oh, really?

2130
02:40:41,542 --> 02:40:43,037
LIAM: I'm on holiday, yeah.

2131
02:40:43,037 --> 02:40:44,080
SAM: Zephra Heights?

2132
02:40:44,080 --> 02:40:49,496
LIAM: Pretty much, yeah. It's all Zephra Heights.
No, I'm very happy right now.

2133
02:40:49,496 --> 02:40:53,483
SAM: You are happy?

2134
02:40:53,483 --> 02:40:54,929
LIAM: Yeah.

2135
02:40:54,929 --> 02:40:56,462
SAM: That's so weird.

2136
02:40:56,462 --> 02:40:58,504
LIAM: I know. I was happy for a long time.

2137
02:40:58,504 --> 02:41:01,429
SAM: But still with the black. You're not giving
that up.

2138
02:41:01,429 --> 02:41:05,715
LIAM: I mean, this is, no! This is part of the
bargain.

2139
02:41:05,715 --> 02:41:08,230
SAM: I mean, some turquoise could pop it up a
little bit.

2140
02:41:08,230 --> 02:41:11,129
LIAM: Yeah, but you know I have sunshine in my
life every day, so it's all right.

2141
02:41:11,129 --> 02:41:13,075
SAM: That's true. How's that all going?

2142
02:41:13,075 --> 02:41:16,776
LIAM: Fucking the best, man! It's the fucking
best!

2143
02:41:16,776 --> 02:41:18,232
SAM: Yeah?

2144
02:41:18,232 --> 02:41:29,287
LIAM: Yeah. But, you know, all I care about is
that you're happier now than you were. You seem a

2145
02:41:29,287 --> 02:41:31,023
little happier.

2146
02:41:31,023 --> 02:41:39,597
SAM: I'm certainly better off than I was when I
left you all. I don't know that I'm happier, just

2147
02:41:39,597 --> 02:41:41,699
better off.

2148
02:41:41,699 --> 02:41:47,345
LIAM: Well, that's a step up. And Kaylie, is she
better off?

2149
02:41:47,345 --> 02:41:48,820
SAM: Most certainly.

2150
02:41:48,820 --> 02:41:50,394
LIAM: Well, that's great.

2151
02:41:50,394 --> 02:41:57,401
SAM: Listen, thank you for coming up here and
stuff. I don't really know

2152
02:41:57,401 --> 02:41:59,006
what to do with the others.

2153
02:41:59,006 --> 02:42:14,742
LIAM: Well, again, a lot of hard shit was said on
your way out, in many directions, and the way I

2154
02:42:14,742 --> 02:42:22,451
look at it, it's to be expected. We went through
hell together, that's going to have an effect. But

2155
02:42:22,451 --> 02:42:32,820
even the ones who are angry at you, they did miss
you. And family doesn't break apart that easy.

2156
02:42:32,820 --> 02:42:38,520
Don't scare away. Just be patient.

2157
02:42:38,520 --> 02:42:41,569
SAM: I'll try.

2158
02:42:41,569 --> 02:42:46,919
LIAM: Clap him on the back of the head.

2159
02:42:46,919 --> 02:42:48,378
SAM: I can't reach.

2160
02:42:48,378 --> 02:42:51,316
LIAM: I can. I love you, man.

2161
02:42:51,316 --> 02:42:55,246
SAM: You too. I'm sorry.

2162
02:42:55,246 --> 02:43:01,184
LIAM: It's good to see you.

2163
02:43:01,184 --> 02:43:03,606
SAM: We're not going to play cards, are we?

2164
02:43:03,606 --> 02:43:08,046
LIAM: I don't know how to play this game.

2165
02:43:08,046 --> 02:43:09,536
SAM: Yeah, okay.

2166
02:43:09,536 --> 02:43:11,621
LIAM: But thanks for the conversation.

2167
02:43:11,621 --> 02:43:12,913
SAM: Sure.

2168
02:43:12,913 --> 02:43:15,432
LIAM: That's been about an hour, I think.

2169
02:43:15,432 --> 02:43:16,932
SAM: Yeah, you should just go.

2170
02:43:16,932 --> 02:43:18,753
LIAM: Yeah.

2171
02:43:18,753 --> 02:43:21,058
SAM: I mean, yeah.

2172
02:43:21,058 --> 02:43:23,754
LIAM: I walk away.

2173
02:43:23,754 --> 02:43:31,807
MATT: All righty. All right. If anyone else wants
to do anything else before dinner, or after?

2174
02:43:31,807 --> 02:43:38,039
MARISHA: I take all the mirrors off the roof of
our bedroom while he talks with Scanlan, and then

2175
02:43:38,039 --> 02:43:40,117
we go to sleep.

2176
02:43:40,117 --> 02:43:42,359
MATT: There are mirrors in yours as well?

2177
02:43:42,359 --> 02:43:43,227
MARISHA: I assume.

2178
02:43:43,227 --> 02:43:49,308
SAM: I hadn't intended on it, but there's
definitely a mirror in there.

2179
02:43:49,308 --> 02:43:59,130
MATT: All right. Your wonderful exposé on salad
types are presented to you by the spectral

2180
02:43:59,130 --> 02:44:04,219
servants. A fantastic dinner of greens of all
shades--

2181
02:44:04,219 --> 02:44:05,717
TRAVIS: Where's the meat?

2182
02:44:05,717 --> 02:44:09,355
SAM: There's lima beans.

2183
02:44:09,355 --> 02:44:15,088
TALIESIN: Do they serve meat for guests, or is it
just Scanlan that's barred?

2184
02:44:15,088 --> 02:44:17,767
LIAM: Not even chicken salad in this mansion?

2185
02:44:17,767 --> 02:44:21,624
SAM: No, the closest we have is lima beans.

2186
02:44:21,624 --> 02:44:25,364
LAURA: They know how to make chicken, though, I
know the servants know how to make chicken!

2187
02:44:25,364 --> 02:44:30,068
SAM: If I have them make chicken, they'll tell
her, and I'll get in trouble.

2188
02:44:30,068 --> 02:44:31,569
TALIESIN: Tell her you didn't have any.

2189
02:44:31,569 --> 02:44:35,786
TRAVIS: That's true. I have an idea. Bring me a
cow. No, I'm kidding.

2190
02:44:35,786 --> 02:44:38,415
MATT: The spectral servant's like--

2191
02:44:38,415 --> 02:44:40,231
SAM: Don't do it.

2192
02:44:40,231 --> 02:44:42,661
TRAVIS: It worked once before.

2193
02:44:42,661 --> 02:44:47,228
SAM: Listen. They make a great cucumber salad.
They've got an excellent endive.

2194
02:44:47,228 --> 02:44:48,781
TRAVIS: What?

2195
02:44:48,781 --> 02:44:50,002
LAURA: Fabulous.

2196
02:44:50,002 --> 02:44:56,710
SAM: A couscous. And a tabbouleh.

2197
02:44:56,710 --> 02:44:59,898
ASHLEY: So, basically, it's one of those meals
that you're still hungry when you eat it all.

2198
02:44:59,898 --> 02:45:02,658
SAM: Yeah, it's really not filling at all. It's
terrible.

2199
02:45:02,658 --> 02:45:05,094
MATT: And he's not lying.

2200
02:45:05,094 --> 02:45:07,037
TALIESIN: Do we lose hit points from this meal?

2201
02:45:07,037 --> 02:45:11,971
LAURA: Oh, shit, did we say that we have to buy
chalices before we have any more fucking feasts?

2202
02:45:11,971 --> 02:45:12,945
MATT: Yes.

2203
02:45:12,945 --> 02:45:14,289
LAURA: Shit balls.

2204
02:45:14,289 --> 02:45:15,784
LIAM: Said Vex.

2205
02:45:15,784 --> 02:45:18,541
LAURA: We're out of chalices!

2206
02:45:18,541 --> 02:45:21,508
ASHLEY: Do we have any chalices in here?

2207
02:45:21,508 --> 02:45:23,434
SAM: For what?

2208
02:45:23,434 --> 02:45:31,080
MATT: They're referring to the Heroes' Feast meal,
but no. Stuff like that, you stock up on.

2209
02:45:31,080 --> 02:45:32,897
LAURA: We've got to remember. We've got to do it.

2210
02:45:32,897 --> 02:45:45,095
MATT: All right. So the meal is filling to varying
degrees of enjoyment, but you find rest at your

2211
02:45:45,095 --> 02:45:48,922
disposal. Relatively early into your day, though
it is night in Ank'harel. You guys have been awake

2212
02:45:48,922 --> 02:45:53,444
for approximately five hours. Do you go to rest?

2213
02:45:53,444 --> 02:45:58,540
SAM: I mean, if we all rest, when we wake up,
those things are gonna be

2214
02:45:58,540 --> 02:46:00,202
swarming outside the door, right?

2215
02:46:00,202 --> 02:46:05,171
LAURA: Yes, potentially, or they could have given
up. What if we just peek out the door and see?

2216
02:46:05,171 --> 02:46:06,309
SAM: We can do that.

2217
02:46:06,309 --> 02:46:08,290
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to peek out the door.

2218
02:46:08,290 --> 02:46:09,726
MATT: Okay.

2219
02:46:09,726 --> 02:46:16,046
LAURA: Very stealthily open the door a little bit
and see. Yeah, I'm going to stay inside the door

2220
02:46:16,046 --> 02:46:17,467
but just look outside the door.

2221
02:46:17,467 --> 02:46:24,941
MATT: You peek outside the door, and right as you
glance through, you see about 13 or so skeletons

2222
02:46:24,941 --> 02:46:28,092
that are all clustered right there at the door
going (zombie groans).

2223
02:46:28,092 --> 02:46:30,225
LAURA: Ah, fuck. Shut it.

2224
02:46:30,225 --> 02:46:31,952
TALIESIN: I feel like that can wait till morning.

2225
02:46:31,952 --> 02:46:37,323
LAURA: I think it might keep getting worse, I'm
not sure.

2226
02:46:37,323 --> 02:46:38,578
SAM: Maybe we should sleep.

2227
02:46:38,578 --> 02:46:40,282
LIAM: We wait till morning and we throw Pike out
the door.

2228
02:46:40,282 --> 02:46:41,778
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's fine. I'll volunteer.

2229
02:46:41,778 --> 02:46:43,769
JON: Can they come into this magic door?

2230
02:46:43,769 --> 02:46:45,082
SAM: No, they have to be invited.

2231
02:46:45,082 --> 02:46:46,951
JON: They can't? Are they vampires?

2232
02:46:46,951 --> 02:46:49,137
LIAM: They're all bones.

2233
02:46:49,137 --> 02:46:52,376
JON: Okay. So we're okay. They can't come in.

2234
02:46:52,376 --> 02:46:53,387
SAM: For a while.

2235
02:46:53,387 --> 02:46:55,779
JON: Is there a back door to this place?

2236
02:46:55,779 --> 02:46:56,959
SAM: Oh, no.

2237
02:46:56,959 --> 02:47:01,786
JON: So if we wake up in the morning and there's
200 of them, then--

2238
02:47:01,786 --> 02:47:03,315
SAM: We're fucked.

2239
02:47:03,315 --> 02:47:08,986
MARISHA: We're okay. We have Pike.

2240
02:47:08,986 --> 02:47:10,562
TALIESIN: We have options.

2241
02:47:10,562 --> 02:47:12,164
JON: What's Pike going to do?

2242
02:47:12,164 --> 02:47:18,519
ASHLEY: Undead is my favored terrain.

2243
02:47:18,519 --> 02:47:21,205
JON: Are you going to talk to them?

2244
02:47:21,205 --> 02:47:23,991
ASHLEY: I could. But what's the point?

2245
02:47:23,991 --> 02:47:26,306
JON: Well, maybe they have secrets.

2246
02:47:26,306 --> 02:47:28,816
Do you have Commune with Skeletons?

2247
02:47:28,816 --> 02:47:30,670
MARISHA: Not all skeletons are like ducks.

2248
02:47:30,670 --> 02:47:33,736
LAURA: Yeah, some of them are a lot meaner.

2249
02:47:33,736 --> 02:47:37,526
ASHLEY: If we find your friends, I can talk to
them if they're dead.

2250
02:47:37,526 --> 02:47:42,005
JON: Maybe they're unhappy with their employer.
Maybe we can find their good side.

2251
02:47:42,005 --> 02:47:45,159
LAURA: We could turn some undead.

2252
02:47:45,159 --> 02:47:47,020
ASHLEY: That's not a bad idea.

2253
02:47:47,020 --> 02:47:50,961
JON: I'm sorry, I never talk so much. I'm just
really hungry after that stupid meal.

2254
02:47:50,961 --> 02:47:53,981
ASHLEY: Same, it's okay. I feel starving.

2255
02:47:53,981 --> 02:47:55,473
TALIESIN: Let's have a nightcap.

2256
02:47:55,473 --> 02:47:57,018
SAM: They can make you a fruit smoothie.

2257
02:47:57,018 --> 02:48:00,379
LAURA: Yes. I want that. I do want it. Yes. Bring
it.

2258
02:48:00,379 --> 02:48:01,993
TALIESIN: That may be breakfast.

2259
02:48:01,993 --> 02:48:03,499
TRAVIS: That'll give you the runs, you don't want
that.

2260
02:48:03,499 --> 02:48:05,072
MARISHA: Can we put some rum in it?

2261
02:48:05,072 --> 02:48:10,806
ASHLEY: Can you have eggs, or is that not vegan?

2262
02:48:10,806 --> 02:48:13,876
SAM: She said vegan. No eggs.

2263
02:48:13,876 --> 02:48:15,775
LAURA: This fucking sucks.

2264
02:48:15,775 --> 02:48:19,737
TALIESIN: A shallow ghost of a dinner served by
shallow ghosts of people. I'm ready for a

2265
02:48:19,737 --> 02:48:21,557
nightcap, and an end of the evening.

2266
02:48:21,557 --> 02:48:32,254
MATT: So you pull out the various bottles you've
stored amongst Grog's Bag of Holding. Scatter a

2267
02:48:32,254 --> 02:48:34,992
nightcap amongst those who wish to partake, and
find yourself resting

2268
02:48:34,992 --> 02:48:36,584
for the evening within the mansion.

2269
02:48:36,584 --> 02:48:38,168
TALIESIN: To a death in the morning.

2270
02:48:38,168 --> 02:48:39,763
MARISHA: To a pina colada.

2271
02:48:39,763 --> 02:48:42,540
LAURA: As we're walking towards the rooms, can I
pull Pike aside for a second?

2272
02:48:42,540 --> 02:48:44,383
MATT: Sure. So as you guys are heading off--

2273
02:48:44,383 --> 02:48:47,577
LAURA: How are you?

2274
02:48:47,577 --> 02:48:59,002
ASHLEY: Well, I'm fine. I'm just finding myself a
little angry.

2275
02:48:59,002 --> 02:49:01,183
LAURA: Well, I think it's reasonable to be angry.

2276
02:49:01,183 --> 02:49:02,711
ASHLEY: And I'm trying not to be.

2277
02:49:02,711 --> 02:49:04,148
LAURA: It's a different side of you.

2278
02:49:04,148 --> 02:49:10,743
ASHLEY: I know. I don't like it. But I can't help
it. What should I do?

2279
02:49:10,743 --> 02:49:20,872
LAURA: Well. Your emotions are justified. But you
found it in your heart to forgive your family, and

2280
02:49:20,872 --> 02:49:30,246
they did terrible things to you. Maybe it's harder
with people that are closer. They cut deeper.

2281
02:49:30,246 --> 02:49:42,384
ASHLEY: Yeah. I think it's just because I didn't
really know them. Maybe it was easier to just let

2282
02:49:42,384 --> 02:49:48,092
them go, and I wasn't as angry as I am with him.

2283
02:49:48,092 --> 02:49:50,861
LAURA: Have you talked to Sarenrae about it?

2284
02:49:50,861 --> 02:49:59,565
ASHLEY: No. I'm just nervous. I know what she'll
say, and have me do, and I just want to be--

2285
02:49:59,565 --> 02:50:01,325
LAURA: You don't want to do it yet.

2286
02:50:01,325 --> 02:50:10,117
ASHLEY: I don't want to do it! I just want to be
mad for a while, I guess, but... I don't know. I

2287
02:50:10,117 --> 02:50:18,574
guess just seeing him again. Slowly but surely,
I'm not as mad, but--

2288
02:50:18,574 --> 02:50:20,309
LAURA: He's still charming.

2289
02:50:20,309 --> 02:50:26,261
ASHLEY: I know, I just feel like now I'm acting
like I'm mad, almost, around him. I don't know.

2290
02:50:26,261 --> 02:50:34,288
He's making me feel so many different kinds of
emotions. I'm confused.

2291
02:50:34,288 --> 02:50:45,854
LAURA: I don't know what tomorrow will bring.
Probably a battle of some sort, which is usually

2292
02:50:45,854 --> 02:50:56,844
life-endangering. Just ask yourself if you would
want to die without saying how you feel.

2293
02:50:56,844 --> 02:51:12,549
ASHLEY: Okay. That's a good idea. I would feel
very bad if something happened to him and I didn't

2294
02:51:12,549 --> 02:51:16,516
say anything. I mean, if I died, then I just
wouldn't know, I guess.

2295
02:51:16,516 --> 02:51:20,816
LAURA: You'd know a few minutes later when we
tried to bring you back.

2296
02:51:20,816 --> 02:51:23,520
I just spit on you, I'm sorry.

2297
02:51:23,520 --> 02:51:32,391
ASHLEY: It's fine, I don't care. Okay. Well,
that's true. Thank you.

2298
02:51:32,391 --> 02:51:34,208
LAURA: It's hard.

2299
02:51:34,208 --> 02:51:36,206
ASHLEY: I know. It is hard.

2300
02:51:36,206 --> 02:51:42,480
LAURA: Well, you know, if you feel like staying up
and wandering around and talking to some people--

2301
02:51:42,480 --> 02:51:47,123
TALIESIN: I come running up. No, now. We're going.
Good night. Good night! Now! Now.

2302
02:51:47,123 --> 02:51:48,661
No more. Good night!

2303
02:51:48,661 --> 02:51:49,926
ASHLEY: Well, good night.

2304
02:51:49,926 --> 02:51:51,062
TALIESIN: Good night!

2305
02:51:51,062 --> 02:51:56,112
ASHLEY: Okay. Well, good night, you two.

2306
02:51:56,112 --> 02:51:58,017
LAURA: We haven't been here in a while.

2307
02:51:58,017 --> 02:52:02,833
TALIESIN: I know. I kind of want to break a few
things. You've earned it, fucker.

2308
02:52:02,833 --> 02:52:15,462
ASHLEY: I go and I knock on Grog's door.

2309
02:52:15,462 --> 02:52:21,873
MATT: Okay. Grog doesn't have a door, Grog is
currently staying in the war room area.

2310
02:52:21,873 --> 02:52:23,318
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right.

2311
02:52:23,318 --> 02:52:30,803
MATT: So as you head down, you see, curled up on
the sand pit, this half-orc snoring loudly, like a

2312
02:52:30,803 --> 02:52:38,275
golden retriever that had rotated twice and passed
out in the sand. Grog, what are you doing?

2313
02:52:38,275 --> 02:52:42,690
TRAVIS: I'm like the dog that's staring at the cat
that stole its fucking bed.

2314
02:52:42,690 --> 02:52:48,108
JON: Can't argue with the dibs policy.

2315
02:52:48,108 --> 02:52:52,791
TRAVIS: It's supreme. It's absolute. It's binding
in all planes.

2316
02:52:52,791 --> 02:52:58,931
JON: All barbarians understand it. It's the law.

2317
02:52:58,931 --> 02:53:04,200
ASHLEY: I stand next to him and stare at Chod--
Lionel in the sand pit.

2318
02:53:04,200 --> 02:53:11,415
TRAVIS: This is bullshit, right? Everything I had,
everything I was, right there. Just another one.

2319
02:53:11,415 --> 02:53:25,800
ASHLEY: Grog, I know that you probably feel
replaced, but there's

2320
02:53:25,800 --> 02:53:28,015
no way he could fill your shoes.

2321
02:53:28,015 --> 02:53:33,879
TRAVIS: I mean, he's big! Look at those feet! It's
like clown feet! I bet he's a great swimmer.

2322
02:53:33,879 --> 02:53:40,833
ASHLEY: He could-- I mean, but his feet are a
little bit too big, you know.

2323
02:53:40,833 --> 02:53:42,247
TRAVIS: Yeah, too big.

2324
02:53:42,247 --> 02:53:43,511
ASHLEY: Your feet are just right.

2325
02:53:43,511 --> 02:53:45,179
TRAVIS: Right. Mm-hm.

2326
02:53:45,179 --> 02:53:53,370
ASHLEY: I have an idea. How about we go get a
bunch of blankets, the ones out of my room. We'll

2327
02:53:53,370 --> 02:53:56,728
just make a fort by the fireplace. We'll make a
better spot.

2328
02:53:56,728 --> 02:54:00,547
TRAVIS: A new spot. Yeah, okay.

2329
02:54:00,547 --> 02:54:14,780
ASHLEY: I just talked to Vex, and she said that
maybe if something were to happen tomorrow, maybe

2330
02:54:14,780 --> 02:54:20,455
it would be better to just say some things, so
that you're not, you know,

2331
02:54:20,455 --> 02:54:22,529
thinking about it if somebody dies.

2332
02:54:22,529 --> 02:54:24,205
TRAVIS: Is somebody dying tomorrow?

2333
02:54:24,205 --> 02:54:26,037
ASHLEY: No.

2334
02:54:26,037 --> 02:54:29,824
TRAVIS: Are you going to die? Pike, you mean the
world to me. Listen, I couldn't go on--

2335
02:54:29,824 --> 02:54:33,000
ASHLEY: I'll be fine, I promise. Just, I guess,
Scanlan.

2336
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:34,902
TRAVIS: What?

2337
02:54:34,902 --> 02:54:37,344
ASHLEY: Maybe, do you feel like you want to talk
to him?

2338
02:54:37,344 --> 02:54:40,419
TRAVIS: No! Yes. No!

2339
02:54:40,419 --> 02:54:52,197
ASHLEY: I think I'm angry with him, but I can tell
you're also angry with him.

2340
02:54:52,197 --> 02:54:53,531
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2341
02:54:53,531 --> 02:54:56,161
ASHLEY: So I'll stay mad at him as long as you
are.

2342
02:54:56,161 --> 02:54:58,774
TRAVIS: Really?

2343
02:54:58,774 --> 02:55:06,731
ASHLEY: But I feel like maybe he feels a little
bad.

2344
02:55:06,731 --> 02:55:16,421
TRAVIS: Are you sure? I can't tell. He changed the
inside of the mansion. He's got a new dog sleeping

2345
02:55:16,421 --> 02:55:22,014
in the sandpit. He called him his best man. You
heard it. I did.

2346
02:55:22,014 --> 02:55:25,319
ASHLEY: That was weird.

2347
02:55:25,319 --> 02:55:27,916
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's fucked up, is what it was.

2348
02:55:27,916 --> 02:55:32,736
ASHLEY: Well, you know what we should do? We
should just tomorrow--

2349
02:55:32,736 --> 02:55:33,839
TRAVIS: Kill him.

2350
02:55:33,839 --> 02:55:50,841
ASHLEY: That's definitely an option, but I feel
like maybe we could just try to be better than

2351
02:55:50,841 --> 02:55:58,278
him. Maybe you could really show off, and show him
that you are better, and that we're better, and

2352
02:55:58,278 --> 02:56:04,919
we're better friends, and you know, that he should
come back and hang out with us.

2353
02:56:04,919 --> 02:56:10,501
TRAVIS: Yeah! No, I like this idea. This is really
something we can roll with! Yeah! He should miss

2354
02:56:10,501 --> 02:56:17,333
us! In fact, he should be coming to beg us to be
like, I miss you! You're so cool!

2355
02:56:17,333 --> 02:56:18,588
ASHLEY: He should!

2356
02:56:18,588 --> 02:56:20,163
TRAVIS: Yeah! We've got to make him remember.

2357
02:56:20,163 --> 02:56:22,127
ASHLEY: We've got to make him remember.

2358
02:56:22,127 --> 02:56:23,140
TRAVIS: Yep.

2359
02:56:23,140 --> 02:56:25,793
ASHLEY: We've got to make him remember how great
we are and what he's lost.

2360
02:56:25,793 --> 02:56:32,042
TRAVIS: Yeah. So tomorrow, all the tricks out the
bag, throw caution to the wind,

2361
02:56:32,042 --> 02:56:35,061
you and me, it's a show.

2362
02:56:35,061 --> 02:56:36,233
ASHLEY: All the tricks.

2363
02:56:36,233 --> 02:56:37,184
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2364
02:56:37,184 --> 02:56:41,794
JON: I suddenly wake up. You guys, I'm used to
sleeping alone. You guys are talking so much.

2365
02:56:41,794 --> 02:56:44,518
ASHLEY: Oh, sorry, we didn't realize you were
awake.

2366
02:56:44,518 --> 02:56:48,474
TRAVIS: Just roll over. If you pile the sand up,
you make little earmuffs.

2367
02:56:48,474 --> 02:56:52,166
JON: It's not working, I'm used to silence, and
you guys are like two alarms.

2368
02:56:52,166 --> 02:56:54,490
TRAVIS: We're going to go. We go make a blanket
fort.

2369
02:56:54,490 --> 02:56:56,090
ASHLEY: We make a blanket fort by the fireplace.

2370
02:56:56,090 --> 02:56:57,102
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2371
02:56:57,102 --> 02:56:59,150
JON: Thank you!

2372
02:56:59,150 --> 02:57:07,171
MATT: All right. As you guys go make a blanket
fort, curl up and sleep takes you. The next

2373
02:57:07,171 --> 02:57:10,603
morning, you come to consciousness, are greeted
with a fantastic,

2374
02:57:10,603 --> 02:57:13,837
spiritually brought, vegan breakfast.

2375
02:57:13,837 --> 02:57:18,303
LAURA: Ooh, but like an acai bowl?

2376
02:57:18,303 --> 02:57:20,804
SAM: Yeah, sure. Yeah, that's a thing.

2377
02:57:20,804 --> 02:57:24,376
MATT: There you go, so it picks up the second day!
There you go.

2378
02:57:24,376 --> 02:57:25,965
LAURA: Is there granola?

2379
02:57:25,965 --> 02:57:27,541
TRAVIS: It doesn't pick up. Don't defend this
shit!

2380
02:57:27,541 --> 02:57:28,930
MATT: Comparatively!

2381
02:57:28,930 --> 02:57:32,686
TRAVIS: Just because it's sweet doesn't mean that
it's savory or satisfying.

2382
02:57:32,686 --> 02:57:34,000
MATT: Fair enough.

2383
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:35,758
JON: There's nothing sticking it together, so it's
just loose.

2384
02:57:35,758 --> 02:57:38,183
TALIESIN: It's only the things that make granola
good that make it not vegan.

2385
02:57:38,183 --> 02:57:39,742
JON: Exactly. It's just all loose.

2386
02:57:39,742 --> 02:57:44,342
TRAVIS: Any proteins that used to have a
heartbeat, in any way? No? Yeah, fuck it.

2387
02:57:44,342 --> 02:57:47,713
LIAM: This is a world of magic and delight!

2388
02:57:47,713 --> 02:57:51,331
LAURA: It's going to catch up when you burp really
good.

2389
02:57:51,331 --> 02:57:53,504
MARISHA: But we have a sound guy who's like--

2390
02:57:53,504 --> 02:57:57,625
LAURA: But what if I want it to catch when I
burp?

2391
02:57:57,625 --> 02:57:59,151
MARISHA: That's what sound guys do.

2392
02:57:59,151 --> 02:58:02,141
MATT: That's how it works? Okay. So what's the
plan, guys?

2393
02:58:02,141 --> 02:58:04,384
LIAM: Stay in the mansion forever.

2394
02:58:04,384 --> 02:58:05,509
MATT: Yeah.

2395
02:58:05,509 --> 02:58:06,765
JON: Let's take a look again.

2396
02:58:06,765 --> 02:58:08,788
ASHLEY: Can I peek out the door?

2397
02:58:08,788 --> 02:58:13,217
TRAVIS: Pike and I go to peek out the door,
because we're not eating shit vegan breakfast.

2398
02:58:13,217 --> 02:58:18,923
MATT: Okay. You peek out into the hallway, and
there before you, you see about 20 or so armored

2399
02:58:18,923 --> 02:58:24,205
skeletons that are all clustered into this
hallway, maybe five feet between a few of them,

2400
02:58:24,205 --> 02:58:26,674
but they're scattered throughout, they're just in
this holding pattern.

2401
02:58:26,674 --> 02:58:28,063
TRAVIS: What do you see?

2402
02:58:28,063 --> 02:58:30,622
ASHLEY: There's just 20 or so skeletons out
there.

2403
02:58:30,622 --> 02:58:33,360
TRAVIS: This is the perfect opportunity!

2404
02:58:33,360 --> 02:58:35,548
ASHLEY: This is the perfect opportunity. Maybe we
take care of it ourselves?

2405
02:58:35,548 --> 02:58:37,469
TRAVIS: I'm saying! You lead the way!

2406
02:58:37,469 --> 02:58:39,686
ASHLEY: Let's do it.

2407
02:58:39,686 --> 02:58:40,783
TRAVIS: Do it.

2408
02:58:40,783 --> 02:58:41,968
SAM: Oh, shit.

2409
02:58:41,968 --> 02:58:43,027
TALIESIN: Oh, shit.

2410
02:58:43,027 --> 02:58:44,616
MARISHA: I approve of this so hard.

2411
02:58:44,616 --> 02:58:45,654
SAM: Wait, we're all still eating breakfast?

2412
02:58:45,654 --> 02:58:47,922
MATT: You guys are eating breakfast, wondering
where Pike and Grog are.

2413
02:58:47,922 --> 02:58:56,859
TRAVIS: Before we break through the door, I should
yell something like, Pike, don't be so brave!

2414
02:58:56,859 --> 02:59:07,091
ASHLEY: Okay, you can yell, Pike, don't be so
brave, and then I can say something like, but

2415
02:59:07,091 --> 02:59:13,951
Grog, you're too strong! I don't know, let me
workshop it.

2416
02:59:13,951 --> 02:59:15,115
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2417
02:59:15,115 --> 02:59:17,632
ASHLEY: Grog, you're too strong! You're too
strong, you're

2418
02:59:17,632 --> 02:59:21,366
just going to kill them all anyway.

2419
02:59:21,366 --> 02:59:22,699
TRAVIS: This is true.

2420
02:59:22,699 --> 02:59:25,566
ASHLEY: Should we just wing it?

2421
02:59:25,566 --> 02:59:27,550
TRAVIS: Yeah, just what happens.

2422
02:59:27,550 --> 02:59:29,488
ASHLEY: Okay, ready?

2423
02:59:29,488 --> 02:59:30,790
TRAVIS: On the count of what?

2424
02:59:30,790 --> 02:59:33,171
ASHLEY: On the count of three.

2425
02:59:33,171 --> 02:59:34,525
TRAVIS: I can do that.

2426
02:59:34,525 --> 02:59:35,788
ASHLEY: I know you can!

2427
02:59:35,788 --> 02:59:36,527
TRAVIS: All right.

2428
02:59:36,527 --> 02:59:38,125
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to get my mace ready.

2429
02:59:38,125 --> 02:59:39,400
MATT: Okay.

2430
02:59:39,400 --> 02:59:40,799
TRAVIS: I have my blood axe.

2431
02:59:40,799 --> 02:59:45,294
LIAM: Back at the breakfast table, just before
they make whatever loud sound they're doing: It's

2432
02:59:45,294 --> 02:59:51,384
good, it's almond milk, but I like cream a little
bit (explosion).

2433
02:59:51,384 --> 02:59:56,687
MATT: Yep, suddenly you guys hear-- What do they
hear?

2434
02:59:56,687 --> 02:59:58,230
TRAVIS: One.

2435
02:59:58,230 --> 03:00:01,514
ASHLEY: Two. Three.

2436
03:00:01,514 --> 03:00:02,904
TRAVIS: Oh, that's it, yeah. Three!

2437
03:00:02,904 --> 03:00:06,812
MATT: All right. Scanlan, because this is your
mansion, you feel the door, suddenly, you sense

2438
03:00:06,812 --> 03:00:08,722
the breaching of the front door opening.

2439
03:00:08,722 --> 03:00:13,147
SAM: Oh, God. The door's open.

2440
03:00:13,147 --> 03:00:14,697
ASHLEY: Grog, you're so strong!

2441
03:00:14,697 --> 03:00:17,307
TRAVIS: Oh, Pike, you're so brave!

2442
03:00:17,307 --> 03:00:18,383
LAURA: Oh, shit.

2443
03:00:18,383 --> 03:00:20,354
TRAVIS: You put yourself before others!

2444
03:00:20,354 --> 03:00:22,505
LAURA: I take off running.

2445
03:00:22,505 --> 03:00:23,997
ASHLEY: I'm going to start swinging my mace.

2446
03:00:23,997 --> 03:00:26,650
MATT: You guys all of a sudden drop your meals and
start charging out. The door's already open, and

2447
03:00:26,751 --> 03:00:32,335
it's vacant. You guys, as you charge out, all of a
sudden you watch as ten of these creatures (zombie

2448
03:00:32,335 --> 03:00:35,846
snarling) and leap towards you. What are you
doing, Pike?

2449
03:00:35,846 --> 03:00:40,040
ASHLEY: I start swinging my Mace of Disruption.
Can I just do this as I go through?

2450
03:00:40,040 --> 03:00:44,089
MATT: You'll still do attacks, but they'll get
attacks on you as you go back and forth.

2451
03:00:44,089 --> 03:00:45,127
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2452
03:00:45,127 --> 03:00:51,698
MATT: You rush forward. Go ahead and make your
attack. Is it, as a war-- do you have two attacks?

2453
03:00:51,698 --> 03:00:54,009
As a bonus action, you can attack, right?

2454
03:00:54,009 --> 03:00:56,974
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! I
forgot, I haven't done this in a minute with

2455
03:00:56,974 --> 03:00:59,386
undead! Okay.

2456
03:00:59,386 --> 03:01:01,442
LAURA: What does the Mace of Disruption do to
undead?

2457
03:01:01,442 --> 03:01:02,709
LIAM: Area of effect, y'all.

2458
03:01:02,709 --> 03:01:06,492
MATT: No, no, it just hits targets. It's the other
one does.

2459
03:01:06,492 --> 03:01:09,526
ASHLEY: It says when you hit a fiend or undead
with this magic weapon, the creature takes an

2460
03:01:09,526 --> 03:01:11,227
extra 2d6 radiant damage.

2461
03:01:11,227 --> 03:01:12,300
MATT: Yep.

2462
03:01:12,300 --> 03:01:24,123
ASHLEY: So. Oh, okay. So 17 and 22.

2463
03:01:24,123 --> 03:01:28,411
MATT: 17 and 22 both hit. Go ahead and roll damage
for each, with the additional disruption damage.

2464
03:01:28,411 --> 03:01:37,953
ASHLEY: Okay, so, I don't have all of the dice
out.

2465
03:01:37,953 --> 03:01:41,205
LAURA: See, this is why you take the time at the
beginning to organize.

2466
03:01:41,205 --> 03:01:43,498
MATT: I know. Grog, while this is happening,
you're also charging in with her

2467
03:01:43,498 --> 03:01:44,591
and you're attacking?

2468
03:01:44,591 --> 03:01:46,608
TRAVIS: Yeah, Great Weapon Master with the blood
axe.

2469
03:01:46,608 --> 03:01:48,846
MATT: Go ahead and make your two attacks with it.

2470
03:01:48,846 --> 03:02:00,533
ASHLEY: So with undead I also roll an additional
2d6, so am I doing four? How many?

2471
03:02:00,533 --> 03:02:05,450
MATT: You would do additional damage as part of
your cleric's war--

2472
03:02:05,450 --> 03:02:07,779
ASHLEY: Okay, so 1d6, plus 2d8.

2473
03:02:07,779 --> 03:02:11,269
MATT: Is the additional disruption damage?

2474
03:02:11,269 --> 03:02:17,430
ASHLEY: Is just one strike. Sorry, I haven't done
this in a while.

2475
03:02:17,430 --> 03:02:28,396
MATT: All right, so as a war domain cleric, you
can make a weapon attack as a bonus action, up to

2476
03:02:28,396 --> 03:02:34,337
your wisdom modifier per day, so that's one use
there. And you deal an additional 1d8 weapon

2477
03:02:34,337 --> 03:02:37,643
damage on the attack, so it's-- How much damage
does your mace do?

2478
03:02:37,643 --> 03:02:44,225
ASHLEY: 1d6 plus six and 2d8 is what I have
written down.

2479
03:02:44,225 --> 03:02:45,426
LAURA: For Divine Strike.

2480
03:02:45,426 --> 03:02:46,433
ASHLEY: For Divine Strike.

2481
03:02:46,433 --> 03:02:51,310
MATT: Correct, yes. Yeah, because you reached 14th
level. So yeah, it's plus 2d8. You got it. 1d6

2482
03:02:51,310 --> 03:02:53,570
plus 2d8 plus whatever the disruption damage is.

2483
03:02:53,570 --> 03:03:00,071
ASHLEY: Okay, so 18.

2484
03:03:00,071 --> 03:03:04,917
MATT: 18 damage on the first hit? You slam the
mace into the side of a skeleton, and it crushes a

2485
03:03:04,917 --> 03:03:09,299
lot of the bone, and a lot of it just seems to
erode away as the divine flash impacts it, and you

2486
03:03:09,299 --> 03:03:15,700
watch as the bleached white turns to gray and
black. However, it still stands, largely wrecked,

2487
03:03:15,700 --> 03:03:19,540
but still (zombie snarling). And your second
attack, you hit the same one?

2488
03:03:19,540 --> 03:03:20,501
ASHLEY: Yep.

2489
03:03:20,501 --> 03:03:23,033
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll damage for that
one.

2490
03:03:23,033 --> 03:03:25,030
ASHLEY: Okay. 14.

2491
03:03:25,030 --> 03:03:28,989
MATT: All right, that one (whack) you hit the side
of the skull, and the head just turns into dust to

2492
03:03:28,989 --> 03:03:32,566
the side. The bones collapse into a pile. You
destroyed one skeleton out of about 20 or so.

2493
03:03:32,566 --> 03:03:34,034
Grog, what are you doing?

2494
03:03:34,034 --> 03:03:37,277
TRAVIS: I did my first attack, it was a 26, and so
was the second one,

2495
03:03:37,277 --> 03:03:38,561
both with Great Weapon Master.

2496
03:03:38,561 --> 03:03:40,156
MATT: Both hit with Great Weapon Master. Go ahead
and roll damage.

2497
03:03:40,156 --> 03:03:41,669
TRAVIS: The first one was 26 damage.

2498
03:03:41,669 --> 03:03:45,582
MATT: You completely destroy a skeleton in one
hit. It turns into a scattering of bone (shatter)

2499
03:03:45,582 --> 03:03:46,844
across the wall.

2500
03:03:46,844 --> 03:03:47,909
TRAVIS: That's what up.

2501
03:03:47,909 --> 03:03:50,044
ASHLEY: Grog, it's so crazy how strong you are!
They're all dying!

2502
03:03:50,044 --> 03:03:52,202
TRAVIS: I know, but I only do it to protect my
friends!

2503
03:03:52,202 --> 03:03:55,923
And the second one is 39 points of damage.

2504
03:03:55,923 --> 03:04:00,358
MATT: And with that second hit, a second skeleton
that's leaping towards you, with a giant scimitar

2505
03:04:00,358 --> 03:04:04,999
in the air and a buckler around the side of its
wrist, (zombie snarling), you just batter-up swing

2506
03:04:04,999 --> 03:04:10,049
it, and it explodes across and rains down upon
you. Pike, a couple of the bones hit your armor,

2507
03:04:10,049 --> 03:04:11,626
fall to the side.

2508
03:04:11,626 --> 03:04:15,786
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, can I go into a rage
and go, I kill these skeletons because I would

2509
03:04:15,786 --> 03:04:17,786
never replace a friend like you!

2510
03:04:17,786 --> 03:04:20,512
ASHLEY: I know, Grog!

2511
03:04:20,512 --> 03:04:24,593
MATT: All right, and so as you guys are rushing
into the doorway, the skeletons immediately turn

2512
03:04:24,593 --> 03:04:29,372
and swarm in. That's going to be five attacks on
each of you within this range here.

2513
03:04:29,372 --> 03:04:30,704
So, against Pike.

2514
03:04:30,704 --> 03:04:33,247
LAURA: Quick, use your spells!

2515
03:04:33,247 --> 03:04:40,638
MATT: All right, so it misses Pike. Misses Pike.
God, misses Pike. Misses Pike.

2516
03:04:40,638 --> 03:04:43,722
And a 20. What's your AC?

2517
03:04:43,722 --> 03:04:46,490
ASHLEY: My AC is 23.

2518
03:04:46,490 --> 03:04:51,512
MATT: 23. All of them leap onto you, but they
can't get through the armor. They're all clustered

2519
03:04:51,512 --> 03:04:55,855
up around you, they're piled up almost, like
you're just being dogpiled by skeletons, and while

2520
03:04:55,855 --> 03:05:00,489
none of them are getting to your flesh, there are
all these skulls biting in front of your face as

2521
03:05:00,489 --> 03:05:06,693
you're holding them back with your shield and
mace. Grog. Miss. Natural one, miss.

2522
03:05:06,693 --> 03:05:09,741
Two, miss. 20?

2523
03:05:09,741 --> 03:05:10,866
TRAVIS: That hits.

2524
03:05:10,866 --> 03:05:13,113
MATT: And 21?

2525
03:05:13,113 --> 03:05:14,280
TRAVIS: Also hits.

2526
03:05:14,280 --> 03:05:20,489
MATT: All right. So, you take 22 points of
slashing damage, reduced to 11, from the two

2527
03:05:20,489 --> 03:05:24,368
attacks together. As both of these skeletons just
start hacking into you with their weapons. One has

2528
03:05:24,368 --> 03:05:28,927
a long sword, one has what looks to be some sort
of a war pick and is just, both of them, jamming

2529
03:05:28,927 --> 03:05:33,411
into your flesh, and you just take it without an
issue. All right. You guys all rush to the door

2530
03:05:33,411 --> 03:05:38,758
and you look out and you can see this group of
undead there, swarming your two friends. You get

2531
03:05:38,758 --> 03:05:41,481
there just-- Well, you start preparing for the
round. They're going first.

2532
03:05:41,481 --> 03:05:42,762
Pike, what are you doing?

2533
03:05:42,762 --> 03:05:46,817
ASHLEY: I'm going to Guiding Bolt down the
hallway. Towards the rest of the skeletons.

2534
03:05:46,817 --> 03:05:48,911
MATT: Guiding Bolt can only hit one target.

2535
03:05:48,911 --> 03:05:50,201
ASHLEY: Oh shit!

2536
03:05:50,201 --> 03:05:56,497
MATT: Yeah, the area effects that you have are
your Turn Undead or Destroy Undead, or any of the

2537
03:05:56,497 --> 03:05:57,717
spells that you have.

2538
03:05:57,717 --> 03:05:58,670
LAURA: Destroy Undead!

2539
03:05:58,670 --> 03:06:00,850
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, Destroy Undead. Fuck, I forgot
about-- Sorry, it's been a minute since I've been

2540
03:06:00,850 --> 03:06:03,262
around them. Okay, yeah, Destroy Undead.

2541
03:06:03,262 --> 03:06:04,484
LIAM: Come on, cleric.

2542
03:06:04,484 --> 03:06:08,135
MATT: Okay. So you are--

2543
03:06:08,135 --> 03:06:09,241
ASHLEY: It's been a minute.

2544
03:06:09,241 --> 03:06:13,866
MATT: Yeah. You're a 17th level cleric now? 16th
level? What level are you?

2545
03:06:13,866 --> 03:06:15,532
ASHLEY: I think 16th level. I don't know if I've
leveled.

2546
03:06:15,532 --> 03:06:26,687
MATT: Yeah, 16th level. So, CR 3 or lower. These
are definitely there. All right. All righty. So,

2547
03:06:26,687 --> 03:06:32,732
you're going to affect with that, in a radial area
here, which is a radius of 30 feet. That's going

2548
03:06:32,732 --> 03:06:34,923
to affect 15 of these undead.

2549
03:06:34,923 --> 03:06:35,988
LAURA: Nice!

2550
03:06:35,988 --> 03:06:37,806
MATT: Within the ones that are piled on you, that
piled on Grog, and the ones that are swarming

2551
03:06:37,806 --> 03:06:39,732
behind. What's your spell DC?

2552
03:06:39,732 --> 03:06:44,154
ASHLEY: 18.

2553
03:06:44,154 --> 03:06:48,347
MATT: Okay. Rolled an 18, but it's a minus one.

2554
03:06:48,347 --> 03:06:55,722
LAURA: Yay. Do you roll for all 15?

2555
03:06:55,722 --> 03:06:56,774
MATT: Mm-hm.

2556
03:06:56,774 --> 03:07:00,506
LIAM: Here he goes. Math. Still math.

2557
03:07:00,506 --> 03:07:02,195
MATT: Oh, no, that one survived.

2558
03:07:02,195 --> 03:07:04,664
LIAM: More math.

2559
03:07:04,664 --> 03:07:11,120
LAURA: Don't confuse him. It's a lot to keep track
of. Hey guys, we have these amazing art prints by

2560
03:07:11,120 --> 03:07:12,275
David Mack.

2561
03:07:12,275 --> 03:07:14,024
MATT: Almost done.

2562
03:07:14,024 --> 03:07:16,396
ASHLEY: Oh fuck, are they all making it?

2563
03:07:16,396 --> 03:07:24,291
MATT: All right. So, out of the 15, two survive.
As you're held down by all of these skeletons,

2564
03:07:24,291 --> 03:07:29,337
suddenly this beacon of divine, bright flame
begins to burst from you. And you watch as the

2565
03:07:29,337 --> 03:07:36,306
flaming wings of Sarenrae swirl up out of her like
a phoenix. And as it does, you see above her the

2566
03:07:36,306 --> 03:07:43,806
image of the dark skin, light flaming hair
Sarenrae embodying her like a JoJo stand, as it

2567
03:07:43,806 --> 03:07:50,073
takes this pose. And as soon as Pike brings her
arms out and screams (yells), the image bursts out

2568
03:07:50,073 --> 03:07:54,264
and you watch as every skeleton practically in
that radius just turns to ash and dust in the

2569
03:07:54,264 --> 03:08:02,582
vicinity, leaving two skeletons there, that are
like (breathy groan). So there's maybe four of

2570
03:08:02,582 --> 03:08:05,283
them left in the whole tunnel, from that one
burst.

2571
03:08:05,283 --> 03:08:07,052
TRAVIS: Damn!

2572
03:08:07,052 --> 03:08:08,557
LAURA: I nudge Scanlan.

2573
03:08:08,557 --> 03:08:10,166
TRAVIS: That was amazing.

2574
03:08:10,166 --> 03:08:11,244
ASHLEY: Do you think Scanlan saw?

2575
03:08:11,244 --> 03:08:12,934
TRAVIS: Yeah, how could he miss it?

2576
03:08:12,934 --> 03:08:14,086
SAM: I'm at the door.

2577
03:08:14,086 --> 03:08:17,835
TRAVIS: (voice breaking) You and me against the
world, huh?

2578
03:08:17,835 --> 03:08:22,218
ASHLEY: You and me, Grog. We're so loyal to each
other.

2579
03:08:22,218 --> 03:08:24,709
TRAVIS: Yep, to the end. Best friends.

2580
03:08:24,709 --> 03:08:26,276
ASHLEY: Best friends till the end.

2581
03:08:26,276 --> 03:08:28,041
MATT: Grog, what are you doing?

2582
03:08:28,041 --> 03:08:29,398
TRAVIS: I'm hitting things.

2583
03:08:29,398 --> 03:08:31,242
MATT: All right, so you rush up to the two.

2584
03:08:31,242 --> 03:08:34,786
LIAM: I walk back to the kitchen and start
clearing people's plates.

2585
03:08:34,786 --> 03:08:35,755
MATT: Okay.

2586
03:08:35,755 --> 03:08:37,228
(laughter)

2587
03:08:37,228 --> 03:08:39,359
SAM: I'll step out into the fray just to watch.

2588
03:08:39,359 --> 03:08:41,057
TRAVIS: A regular strike, 25.

2589
03:08:41,057 --> 03:08:42,149
MATT: Hits.

2590
03:08:42,149 --> 03:08:43,744
TRAVIS: Ooh, and a 17.

2591
03:08:43,744 --> 03:08:45,353
MATT: Yeah, they all hit.

2592
03:08:45,353 --> 03:08:47,531
TRAVIS: That's as low as I can roll.

2593
03:08:47,531 --> 03:08:49,169
MATT: 17 is a low for you.

2594
03:08:49,169 --> 03:08:53,510
TRAVIS: I know. 16 points of damage on the first
one.

2595
03:08:53,510 --> 03:08:57,941
MATT: All right, first hit, it smacks into the
side and breaks part of its upper shoulder and

2596
03:08:57,941 --> 03:09:02,376
upper arm. It cuts off one of its arms, but it's
still standing there in front of you.

2597
03:09:02,376 --> 03:09:06,812
TRAVIS: That's embarrassing. I use the second
strike on the same skeleton

2598
03:09:06,812 --> 03:09:08,757
and hope Scanlan didn't notice.

2599
03:09:08,757 --> 03:09:09,859
SAM: I saw.

2600
03:09:09,859 --> 03:09:11,739
(laughter)

2601
03:09:11,739 --> 03:09:13,924
TRAVIS: Fuck. 15 points of damage.

2602
03:09:13,924 --> 03:09:16,982
MATT: 15 points of damage does destroy the
skeleton, the one that's giving you a hard time.

2603
03:09:16,982 --> 03:09:21,426
This time you just cleave through the center of
its spinal column and torso. It tumbles over and

2604
03:09:21,426 --> 03:09:22,973
just scatters into a pile of bones.

2605
03:09:22,973 --> 03:09:29,429
TRAVIS: Yeah. He saw it, didn't he? I fucked it
up. He saw it and my whole plan's gone to shit.

2606
03:09:29,429 --> 03:09:31,773
ASHLEY: So much is happening at once, he can't
see, he didn't see.

2607
03:09:31,773 --> 03:09:37,298
MATT: All right, so. Vex, you're at the door.
Scanlan, you're at the door. You're at the door,

2608
03:09:37,298 --> 03:09:38,954
Lionel. What are you guys doing?

2609
03:09:38,954 --> 03:09:41,490
LAURA: I sh-- I'm going to hold it.

2610
03:09:41,490 --> 03:09:42,987
MATT: There's three skeletons still standing.

2611
03:09:42,987 --> 03:09:46,330
LAURA: All right, I'll shoot one of the
skeletons.

2612
03:09:46,330 --> 03:09:49,108
MATT: Go for it. Roll for attack. Lionel, what are
you doing?

2613
03:09:49,108 --> 03:09:54,391
JON: I'm just like: it's cool. I'm just watching.
I forget, you know--

2614
03:09:54,391 --> 03:09:55,487
MATT: Okay.

2615
03:09:55,487 --> 03:10:07,925
JON: But then I see and I'm like: Oh, I got them.
So I think it's now time to impress Grog a little

2616
03:10:07,925 --> 03:10:11,012
bit, because he knows-- He goes into a rage.

2617
03:10:11,012 --> 03:10:13,653
MATT: All right, so you go into a rage. Pull your
great sword?

2618
03:10:13,653 --> 03:10:15,931
JON: My what?

2619
03:10:15,931 --> 03:10:17,832
(laughter)

2620
03:10:17,832 --> 03:10:19,779
MATT: All right, so you're charging out. What did
you roll?

2621
03:10:19,779 --> 03:10:22,815
LAURA: Oh, I just decided maybe I shouldn't hit
them, though.

2622
03:10:22,815 --> 03:10:25,857
MATT: All right, so you go to fire and then pull
the arrow back.

2623
03:10:25,857 --> 03:10:27,229
LAURA: Because I rolled a one.

2624
03:10:27,229 --> 03:10:28,434
(laughter)

2625
03:10:28,434 --> 03:10:29,422
MATT: Oh.

2626
03:10:29,422 --> 03:10:30,600
JON: Wait a second.

2627
03:10:30,600 --> 03:10:33,989
LAURA: Oh no, it's the chicken-Scanlan incident
all over again.

2628
03:10:33,989 --> 03:10:36,473
MATT: So what happens is, you go and release it,
and you just mis-strung it (sound of rope

2629
03:10:36,473 --> 03:10:38,341
snapping), and you're like: Oh, I just didn't--

2630
03:10:38,341 --> 03:10:40,266
LAURA: You know what? I'm going to leave it. It's
for them.

2631
03:10:40,266 --> 03:10:41,482
TRAVIS: She's got the bruise on the--

2632
03:10:41,482 --> 03:10:45,431
MATT: Yeah. So you rush up alongside Grog at the
three skeletons that are there.

2633
03:10:45,431 --> 03:10:48,000
LAURA: I got a blood blister on my arm.

2634
03:10:48,000 --> 03:10:50,854
JON: I roll this?

2635
03:10:50,854 --> 03:10:54,113
TALIESIN: Yeah, and you add the attack bonus of
your great sword, which is right in the center.

2636
03:10:54,113 --> 03:10:55,510
JON: Plus 12.

2637
03:10:55,575 --> 03:10:57,840
TALIESIN: Oh, natural 20!

2638
03:10:57,840 --> 03:10:59,951
MATT: Oh, critical hit on the first hit?

2639
03:10:59,951 --> 03:11:01,778
TRAVIS: Motherfucker.

2640
03:11:01,778 --> 03:11:03,659
MATT: All right, so that hits. Roll the second
attack.

2641
03:11:03,659 --> 03:11:05,085
SAM: He's so strong.

2642
03:11:05,085 --> 03:11:06,359
LAURA: Don't say that!

2643
03:11:06,359 --> 03:11:08,034
TALIESIN: Another?! What?! What?!

2644
03:11:08,034 --> 03:11:09,210
JON: Another 20.

2645
03:11:09,210 --> 03:11:10,558
MATT: Did you roll two 20s in a row?

2646
03:11:10,558 --> 03:11:11,982
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

2647
03:11:11,982 --> 03:11:15,656
JON: He's raging, dude, and he's had a really
great sleep in the sand.

2648
03:11:15,656 --> 03:11:17,341
SAM: I've never seen anyone so strong and powerful
before.

2649
03:11:17,341 --> 03:11:19,363
TALIESIN: He doesn't even understand what just
happened.

2650
03:11:19,363 --> 03:11:20,605
JON: Are you getting turned on?

2651
03:11:20,605 --> 03:11:21,553
SAM: Yes!

2652
03:11:21,553 --> 03:11:24,260
MATT: You're honing Vin Diesel right now with this
crit power.

2653
03:11:24,260 --> 03:11:29,427
JON: Well, he's finally-- He likes these guys, he
wants to finally show off and do something cool.

2654
03:11:29,427 --> 03:11:31,314
TALIESIN: Travis just aged a year.

2655
03:11:31,314 --> 03:11:33,299
LAURA: Oh no.

2656
03:11:33,299 --> 03:11:38,894
MATT: So you rush forward to the first skeleton.
Roll 2d6.

2657
03:11:38,894 --> 03:11:40,525
TALIESIN: Roll 4d6.

2658
03:11:40,525 --> 03:11:41,945
MATT: Yeah, roll 4d6.

2659
03:11:41,945 --> 03:11:43,530
TALIESIN: Roll four of these.

2660
03:11:43,530 --> 03:11:44,897
JON: Which ones? Okay.

2661
03:11:44,897 --> 03:11:46,374
TALIESIN: And I think you get to reroll.

2662
03:11:46,374 --> 03:11:47,812
JON: I have to roll the two dice.

2663
03:11:47,812 --> 03:11:50,147
TALIESIN: Yeah, roll those and add two more. Or
roll them twice.

2664
03:11:50,147 --> 03:11:52,068
Yeah, there you go. Four of those.

2665
03:11:52,068 --> 03:11:54,106
MATT: And then you get to reroll any ones or twos.

2666
03:11:54,106 --> 03:11:56,854
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

2667
03:11:56,854 --> 03:11:59,035
TRAVIS: What? Are they all fucking sixes?

2668
03:11:59,035 --> 03:12:00,062
JON: Is that a six?

2669
03:12:00,062 --> 03:12:00,937
TALIESIN: That's a six.

2670
03:12:00,937 --> 03:12:02,188
JON: Six, six, three, three.

2671
03:12:02,188 --> 03:12:04,014
MATT: Okay, so 12, 18 plus?

2672
03:12:04,014 --> 03:12:05,793
TRAVIS: Percy, take your hand off of him.

2673
03:12:05,793 --> 03:12:08,624
JON: No, he needs the help.

2674
03:12:08,624 --> 03:12:13,529
MATT: So as you rush forward with your greatsword,
big smile on your face, next to Grog. Whack! You

2675
03:12:13,529 --> 03:12:16,948
just shatter one skeleton with the first attack.
Roll damage for the second attack.

2676
03:12:16,948 --> 03:12:18,006
TALIESIN: All four.

2677
03:12:18,006 --> 03:12:19,598
MATT: All four again.

2678
03:12:19,598 --> 03:12:25,480
SAM: Six. That one's cocked, reroll it. Six.

2679
03:12:25,480 --> 03:12:27,596
(laughter)

2680
03:12:27,596 --> 03:12:29,525
TRAVIS: I'm leaving. I'm going away.

2681
03:12:29,525 --> 03:12:35,718
JON: And I'm like: Grog, look at this, this is
awesome! I think I'm channeling you.

2682
03:12:35,718 --> 03:12:38,568
TRAVIS: (strained voice) Yep. Real impressive.

2683
03:12:38,568 --> 03:12:42,939
MATT: You just, one skeleton, the other comes
jumping at you and you just grab it in your hand

2684
03:12:42,939 --> 03:12:45,479
and crush its skull in your hand.

2685
03:12:45,479 --> 03:12:46,993
TRAVIS: (strained voice) That was real cool.

2686
03:12:46,993 --> 03:12:48,882
JON: And then I go: Look, I'm a gymnast!

2687
03:12:48,882 --> 03:12:51,693
(laughter)

2688
03:12:51,693 --> 03:12:53,501
JON: With all the chalk and everything.

2689
03:12:53,501 --> 03:12:54,946
LIAM: You've got to appreciate that, Travis.

2690
03:12:54,946 --> 03:12:59,733
TRAVIS: (strained voice) It was a good moment.
That was really impressive.

2691
03:12:59,733 --> 03:13:02,409
MATT: Percy. You want to do anything?

2692
03:13:02,409 --> 03:13:07,315
TALIESIN: I'm just going to sit next to Vex and I
think we're just

2693
03:13:07,315 --> 03:13:08,856
going to stand and let this happen.

2694
03:13:08,856 --> 03:13:12,947
MATT: So Pike, Grog, Lionel, you're right there,
there's one skeleton left that's like (breathy

2695
03:13:12,947 --> 03:13:24,148
hiss). And it leaps at you, since you just crushed
its friend. And it hits you on your breastplate

2696
03:13:24,148 --> 03:13:30,020
and just goes (metal ringing out sound) (breathy
hiss). That's all it does. It's a sad sight.

2697
03:13:30,020 --> 03:13:35,485
JON: Look, it's doing the Duck Flail to me. It's
not as good, but that is what he's doing.

2698
03:13:35,485 --> 03:13:38,667
MATT: All right, who wants to finish this poor
thing?

2699
03:13:38,667 --> 03:13:40,879
ASHLEY: Finish him, Grog, finish it.

2700
03:13:40,879 --> 03:13:42,912
TRAVIS: I'm broken on the inside. Did you see that
display?

2701
03:13:42,912 --> 03:13:44,638
ASHLEY: Grog, I need your help!

2702
03:13:44,638 --> 03:13:48,786
TRAVIS: (yells) Reckless, Great Weapon Master.

2703
03:13:48,786 --> 03:13:50,622
(laughter)

2704
03:13:50,622 --> 03:13:52,482
MATT: Go for it, Grog.

2705
03:13:52,482 --> 03:13:55,103
TRAVIS: A one?!

2706
03:13:55,103 --> 03:13:56,232
TALIESIN: Yes!

2707
03:13:56,232 --> 03:13:57,496
TRAVIS: A one?!!

2708
03:13:57,496 --> 03:14:01,782
(laughter and yelling)

2709
03:14:01,782 --> 03:14:03,782
ASHLEY: Can I War God's Bless it?

2710
03:14:03,782 --> 03:14:08,443
MATT: A natural one is an auto fail. I cannot-- I
cannot--

2711
03:14:08,443 --> 03:14:10,482
TRAVIS: What is going on?!

2712
03:14:10,482 --> 03:14:12,894
(laughter)

2713
03:14:12,894 --> 03:14:20,899
MATT: As you look at the one skeleton, just
feeling this embarrassment, you swing with your

2714
03:14:20,899 --> 03:14:26,971
axe and the skeleton (metal impact sound) stops it
with its own blade and parries the axe to the

2715
03:14:26,971 --> 03:14:32,314
side. The one that just didn't barely dent his
armor.

2716
03:14:32,314 --> 03:14:37,253
JON: And then I say: It's okay, Grog. Everybody
messes up sometimes, let me get this one.

2717
03:14:37,253 --> 03:14:40,062
(laughter)

2718
03:14:40,062 --> 03:14:43,753
JON: Can I roll?

2719
03:14:43,753 --> 03:14:45,910
MATT: Yeah.

2720
03:14:45,910 --> 03:14:47,717
TALIESIN: That's a nine.

2721
03:14:47,717 --> 03:14:49,724
SAM: As he rolls, I will inspire him.

2722
03:14:49,724 --> 03:14:55,003
JON: Nine plus 12, that's 21. 22!

2723
03:14:55,003 --> 03:14:57,012
SAM: I'm going to sing-- Oh well, that's fine,
that's fine.

2724
03:14:57,012 --> 03:15:02,938
MATT: So that hits. Go ahead and roll damage. Just
2d6 plus seven. Well, plus your--

2725
03:15:02,938 --> 03:15:04,240
TALIESIN: Just two.

2726
03:15:04,240 --> 03:15:05,774
JON: Oh, okay.

2727
03:15:05,774 --> 03:15:07,773
SAM: Okay, that's not as good.

2728
03:15:07,773 --> 03:15:09,901
MATT: Well, it's plus seven, plus your rage
damage. So it's plus ten.

2729
03:15:09,901 --> 03:15:13,404
SAM: To this? 15.

2730
03:15:13,404 --> 03:15:14,950
TALIESIN: No, plus seven also.

2731
03:15:14,950 --> 03:15:16,895
MATT: Plus ten to whatever he rolled there.

2732
03:15:16,895 --> 03:15:18,236
SAM: Five plus ten.

2733
03:15:18,236 --> 03:15:23,352
MATT: All right, so 20 points. So as you hack down
this other skeleton, you cut into it and it

2734
03:15:23,352 --> 03:15:28,114
destroys part of its torso. Its arm that's holding
its weapon is hanging to the side, but it's still

2735
03:15:28,114 --> 03:15:29,949
standing. Its jaw is unhinged.

2736
03:15:29,949 --> 03:15:31,788
TALIESIN: You get another shot, don't you?

2737
03:15:31,788 --> 03:15:33,001
MATT: Yep. So you attack again.

2738
03:15:33,001 --> 03:15:34,904
TALIESIN: Yeah, attack again.

2739
03:15:34,904 --> 03:15:36,371
JON: Four?

2740
03:15:36,371 --> 03:15:37,605
TALIESIN: 16?

2741
03:15:37,605 --> 03:15:43,235
MATT: 16 still hits. It's a skeleton. That's
enough. You finish it off. You destroy the other

2742
03:15:43,235 --> 03:15:44,629
skeleton in two hits.

2743
03:15:44,629 --> 03:15:53,424
JON: That was kind of a tough one, I get it. It's
okay. That was a really hard skeleton. But he's

2744
03:15:53,424 --> 03:15:55,056
dead now. Let's go--

2745
03:15:55,056 --> 03:15:58,772
ASHLEY: We had it. We just-- We had it.

2746
03:15:58,772 --> 03:16:03,337
JON: Can we eat these skeletons, because that
breakfast is still blowing.

2747
03:16:03,337 --> 03:16:05,425
ASHLEY: Yes you can. Give it a bite. Give it a
bite.

2748
03:16:05,425 --> 03:16:07,521
JON: Is there any meat left on those bones?

2749
03:16:07,521 --> 03:16:12,476
SAM: Chod, that was amazing. You slew those
skeletons like they were nothing. Incredible.

2750
03:16:12,476 --> 03:16:17,718
JON: Oh, I just do whatever I can for my friends.
You guys are all awesome and I'm just glad I could

2751
03:16:17,718 --> 03:16:19,404
be of service and help.

2752
03:16:19,404 --> 03:16:22,486
SAM: Yes. It's good to have someone like you by
our side.

2753
03:16:22,486 --> 03:16:23,630
JON: Awesome!

2754
03:16:23,630 --> 03:16:25,587
ASHLEY: I walk back inside of the mansion.

2755
03:16:25,587 --> 03:16:29,064
TRAVIS: I take out the giant cask of ale and I
just...

2756
03:16:29,064 --> 03:16:32,182
MATT: Just chug it.

2757
03:16:32,182 --> 03:16:35,136
SAM: Are you drinking it or just pouring it all
over you?

2758
03:16:35,136 --> 03:16:36,363
TRAVIS: Both.

2759
03:16:36,363 --> 03:16:39,291
LIAM: I come out with fresh coffee for Percy and
Keyleth. What happened?

2760
03:16:39,291 --> 03:16:42,949
TALIESIN: It was beautiful, terrible. I'm not
entirely sure.

2761
03:16:42,949 --> 03:16:46,444
ASHLEY: Chod saved the day. Chod saved the day.

2762
03:16:46,444 --> 03:16:50,534
TALIESIN: Well, really, he cleaned up after you
two finished it all off.

2763
03:16:50,534 --> 03:16:51,932
ASHLEY: He did. He did.

2764
03:16:51,932 --> 03:16:52,902
TALIESIN: He swept up.

2765
03:16:52,902 --> 03:16:56,168
LAURA: That was a lot of skeletons that you
killed, Pike, with that spell.

2766
03:16:56,168 --> 03:16:57,419
That was really good.

2767
03:16:57,419 --> 03:16:59,831
TALIESIN: You and Grog were most of the skeletons,
easily.

2768
03:16:59,831 --> 03:17:01,068
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2769
03:17:01,068 --> 03:17:02,461
SAM: Are we all back in the mansion?

2770
03:17:02,461 --> 03:17:03,890
MATT: You're all back in the mansion, now.

2771
03:17:03,890 --> 03:17:05,852
LIAM: Why is it so tense in here all of a sudden?

2772
03:17:05,852 --> 03:17:07,784
SAM: I think I know what's going on.

2773
03:17:07,784 --> 03:17:09,213
ASHLEY: I don't know what happened.

2774
03:17:09,213 --> 03:17:16,107
SAM: Grog. Grog, Pike, can I say something? I feel
like there's some tension between us and we need

2775
03:17:16,107 --> 03:17:26,882
to clear the air if we're going to go fight today.
You guys are really bad today. Well. And I think

2776
03:17:26,882 --> 03:17:36,242
it's because I haven't made you feel at ease. So
can I please just take a moment before we go out

2777
03:17:36,242 --> 03:17:42,992
there and just, for once and for all, say I'm
sorry to you guys for what I did and how I left

2778
03:17:42,992 --> 03:17:50,171
things. I said things that were really cruel and
meant to hurt you, and that's wrong and I'll

2779
03:17:50,171 --> 03:17:55,903
probably regret it for the rest of my life. But I
needed to go and I just didn't know how to express

2780
03:17:55,903 --> 03:18:03,934
myself. And I'm so sorry that I insulted you.
Pike, I've said awful things to you for as long as

2781
03:18:03,934 --> 03:18:08,474
we've known each other, and I can't take them
back, but I can at least try to be a better

2782
03:18:08,474 --> 03:18:24,366
person. And can I confess something to you? During
the last year, I've-- I think I've been praying. I

2783
03:18:24,366 --> 03:18:31,694
mean, I just talk at night and nobody hears me,
but I guess that's praying, right? And sometimes I

2784
03:18:31,694 --> 03:18:41,045
talk to Sarenrae, because that's the only one I
know. And she seems cool. And she seems like

2785
03:18:41,045 --> 03:18:50,076
someone who could be a good guide. And it feels
good. And I even wrote a little poem about her and

2786
03:18:50,076 --> 03:18:55,663
about her teachings. It's very simple, but can I
tell you it?

2787
03:18:55,663 --> 03:19:00,594
ASHLEY: Let's hear.

2788
03:19:00,594 --> 03:19:12,154
SAM: It's really simple. It goes: "Everybody
people, everybody bleed, everybody need something.

2789
03:19:12,154 --> 03:19:22,204
"Everybody love, everybody know, how it go." I know
it's stupid, but there's a certain Logic to it.

2790
03:19:22,204 --> 03:19:27,474
ASHLEY: Certain Logic to it. That actually makes a
lot of sense.

2791
03:19:27,474 --> 03:19:36,779
SAM: It makes me feel connected to you guys, even
though you're not there. So I say that to myself

2792
03:19:36,779 --> 03:19:39,009
every night before I go to sleep.

2793
03:19:39,009 --> 03:19:42,321
ASHLEY: It just makes you feel connected to
Everybody people.

2794
03:19:42,321 --> 03:19:44,096
SAM: Yeah.

2795
03:19:44,096 --> 03:19:45,412
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2796
03:19:45,412 --> 03:19:46,446
SAM: And Grog.

2797
03:19:46,446 --> 03:19:47,645
TRAVIS: No, stop.

2798
03:19:47,645 --> 03:19:50,866
SAM: I can't apologize to you, because words don't
work.

2799
03:19:50,866 --> 03:19:59,254
TRAVIS: So, let me get this straight. You think
you can go away for a year, and come back, <i>in a</i>

2800
03:19:59,254 --> 03:20:07,114
<i>disguise,</i> and apologize to this group, and that's
going to be good enough for me? And then when I'm

2801
03:20:07,114 --> 03:20:12,478
still pissed, you're going to give me a combo
apology with Pike, and that's going to be good

2802
03:20:12,478 --> 03:20:20,959
enough for me? I'm still pissed. You came back in
a costume. A costume! I'm not even really that

2803
03:20:20,959 --> 03:20:28,094
smart, it's not hard to trick me. And I'm a big
guy, but you made me feel <i>small.</i> I don't know if

2804
03:20:28,094 --> 03:20:35,652
you missed us; I don't know if somebody is making
us go down into this Zigga-fuck.

2805
03:20:35,652 --> 03:20:37,055
ASHLEY: (whispers) Ziggurat.

2806
03:20:37,055 --> 03:20:42,796
TRAVIS: Ziggurat. I don't even know why we're
here. I thought maybe you'd come back and be like,

2807
03:20:42,796 --> 03:20:52,067
oh my best mate, the guy that would do anything to
keep me alive, there he is, I missed him. No. You

2808
03:20:52,067 --> 03:20:59,217
come back, you've found yourself a brand new
idiot. One that does amazing strikes, twice in a

2809
03:20:59,217 --> 03:21:06,728
row. And talks to ducks. Has all sorts of new
tricks, brand new model, new and improved in every

2810
03:21:06,728 --> 03:21:17,593
way. I bet you do all sorts of fun things with
him. So no. You do not get to apologize to me.

2811
03:21:17,593 --> 03:21:28,831
SAM: I wasn't going to. I was just going to give
you a gift. Because the times we had together were

2812
03:21:28,831 --> 03:21:40,237
the best times ever. You might be a little slow.
But you're the best friend I ever had. And our

2813
03:21:40,237 --> 03:21:50,007
times together were great, not because of our
conversations, or our witty repartee. It was

2814
03:21:50,007 --> 03:21:56,953
because of the fun we had together and the
experiences we had. So last night, I wrote

2815
03:21:56,953 --> 03:22:00,534
something for you. I know you can't read, but--

2816
03:22:00,534 --> 03:22:01,777
LAURA: He <i>can</i> read.

2817
03:22:01,777 --> 03:22:04,862
TRAVIS: No, Vex. He doesn't know that.

2818
03:22:04,862 --> 03:22:15,553
SAM: I just got you a gift. Because if you won't
spend time with me now, maybe you'll be able to

2819
03:22:15,553 --> 03:22:23,547
spend time on your own. So I wrote you this. Maybe
someone else can read it for him.

2820
03:22:23,547 --> 03:22:26,482
ASHLEY: He might be able to read it, Scanlan.

2821
03:22:26,482 --> 03:22:28,859
LAURA: It depends on if there are long words.

2822
03:22:28,859 --> 03:22:30,364
SAM: There's really long words.

2823
03:22:30,364 --> 03:22:32,027
TRAVIS: It's a big word. It's a bit--

2824
03:22:32,027 --> 03:22:34,567
ASHLEY: Well, just give it a try.

2825
03:22:34,567 --> 03:22:38,715
TRAVIS: Aoo, ooh, shh.

2826
03:22:38,715 --> 03:22:40,112
SAM: Nope. Nope.

2827
03:22:40,112 --> 03:22:45,781
TRAVIS: (whispering) I'm really embarrassed. I'm
really embarrassed.

2828
03:22:45,781 --> 03:22:47,853
ASHLEY: (whispering) I'll whisper it to you, then
you say it out loud.

2829
03:22:47,853 --> 03:22:54,907
TRAVIS: (clears throat) Yeah, I don't feel like
showing off my powers. I can't read the dirty hand

2830
03:22:54,907 --> 03:22:56,925
of betrayal.

2831
03:22:56,925 --> 03:23:05,938
ASHLEY: All who read this, let it be known, by
order of Aes Adon-- it's a stupid name, Scanlan.

2832
03:23:05,938 --> 03:23:08,138
But it's fine.

2833
03:23:08,138 --> 03:23:09,548
SAM: It's Elvish.

2834
03:23:09,548 --> 03:23:11,943
LIAM: It's a stupid name.

2835
03:23:11,943 --> 03:23:26,002
ASHLEY: AKA the Meat Man, AKA Vicoul the Vicious,
AKA Reddish the Bold, AKA the Little Paws, AKA

2836
03:23:26,002 --> 03:23:35,872
François Bertrand Jean-Luc Australia, be aware
that the bearer of this note, Grog Strongjaw,

2837
03:23:35,872 --> 03:23:43,604
shall be entitled to any libation of his choosing
at any pub, tavern, restaurant, inn, alehouse,

2838
03:23:43,604 --> 03:23:52,421
brewery, or house of lady favors within the city
limits of Ank'Harel. He shall be allowed to drink

2839
03:23:52,421 --> 03:23:58,602
until drunk, and enjoy no molestation by any
employee of said establishment, unless he requests

2840
03:23:58,602 --> 03:24:06,189
it. All charges and bills related to his drinking,
cavorting, or violent behavior resulting from

2841
03:24:06,189 --> 03:24:12,989
drunkenness, shall be forwarded to the Meat Man
for timely payment in full. By complying with this

2842
03:24:12,989 --> 03:24:19,553
request, you are hereby under the protection of
the Meat Man, and shall receive all the benefits

2843
03:24:19,553 --> 03:24:30,355
and goodwill accompanying such association. The
Meat Man always remembers. Sincerely, Aes Adon.

2844
03:24:30,355 --> 03:24:40,649
TRAVIS: Probably best to test it out. See if it's
even worth anything.

2845
03:24:40,649 --> 03:24:53,770
SAM: Grog, I love you. I'm sorry that we won't get
to hang out, because you hate me now. But I would

2846
03:24:53,770 --> 03:24:58,454
never replace you. And if you ask me right now--

2847
03:24:58,454 --> 03:25:00,057
TRAVIS: You'll kill him?

2848
03:25:00,057 --> 03:25:01,836
SAM: I will kill him.

2849
03:25:01,836 --> 03:25:06,859
JON: Who?

2850
03:25:06,859 --> 03:25:09,003
(hushed laughter)

2851
03:25:09,003 --> 03:25:10,720
TALIESIN: (quietly) I wouldn't worry about it.

2852
03:25:10,720 --> 03:25:13,122
JON: Okay. I really like this job.

2853
03:25:13,122 --> 03:25:14,428
TRAVIS: He's all right.

2854
03:25:14,428 --> 03:25:17,827
(hushed laughter)

2855
03:25:17,827 --> 03:25:21,971
SAM: Will you go drinking with me some time?

2856
03:25:21,971 --> 03:25:32,575
TRAVIS: We'll see. By the way, I want you to know:
when you died, I sang a song I would never sing

2857
03:25:32,575 --> 03:25:36,010
for anyone else, and I'm sorry you didn't hear it,
but it was really hard.

2858
03:25:36,010 --> 03:25:37,904
SAM: Is that true?

2859
03:25:37,904 --> 03:25:39,607
LAURA and LIAM: Yes.

2860
03:25:39,607 --> 03:25:41,186
SAM: He sang?

2861
03:25:41,186 --> 03:25:42,433
TALIESIN: Yes.

2862
03:25:42,433 --> 03:25:44,188
JON: Do a truthful check.

2863
03:25:44,188 --> 03:25:45,729
LAURA: Do you know what he sang?

2864
03:25:45,729 --> 03:25:51,428
SAM: A truthful check? Sure, I'll roll a truthful
check.

2865
03:25:51,428 --> 03:25:54,528
MATT: An insight check? Okay.

2866
03:25:54,528 --> 03:25:55,841
SAM: Natural 20.

2867
03:25:55,841 --> 03:25:56,898
LAURA: Whoa.

2868
03:25:56,898 --> 03:26:01,950
MATT: Honest as the day, or Grog dick is long, he
apparently sang.

2869
03:26:01,950 --> 03:26:05,150
TRAVIS: It is, I can just lean forward.

2870
03:26:05,150 --> 03:26:06,437
MARISHA: Happy 100th.

2871
03:26:06,437 --> 03:26:07,575
MATT: Happy 100th.

2872
03:26:07,575 --> 03:26:09,669
(laughter)

2873
03:26:09,669 --> 03:26:13,431
LAURA: Grog, I didn't hear it. Maybe you should
sing it, and let him know what it was.

2874
03:26:13,431 --> 03:26:15,756
TRAVIS: Oh, you know, it's like the face of death
in the hallway,

2875
03:26:15,756 --> 03:26:17,653
once it uses up its power, it's done.

2876
03:26:17,653 --> 03:26:29,676
SAM: I'm so sorry I missed it. And I hope someday
we'll sing together, in a drunken stupor together.

2877
03:26:29,676 --> 03:26:33,107
Maybe that will remind you.

2878
03:26:33,107 --> 03:26:35,644
TRAVIS: Maybe.

2879
03:26:35,644 --> 03:26:43,437
SAM: I was an asshole, Grog, I'm sorry. I would
never, never replace you, ever.

2880
03:26:43,437 --> 03:26:45,313
You're irreplaceable.

2881
03:26:45,313 --> 03:26:47,891
ASHLEY: And he could've read this, by the way.

2882
03:26:47,891 --> 03:26:50,311
SAM: That's incredible.

2883
03:26:50,311 --> 03:26:52,654
TRAVIS: I would've gotten the name right.

2884
03:26:52,654 --> 03:26:58,441
MARISHA: Wait, did you frame it like a coupon
book? That's very impressive.

2885
03:26:58,441 --> 03:27:00,190
SAM: I had some time last night.

2886
03:27:00,190 --> 03:27:04,136
ASHLEY: Coupons, that you can sort of pick out of
it like a--

2887
03:27:04,136 --> 03:27:06,078
LAURA: A free massage.

2888
03:27:06,078 --> 03:27:10,503
MARISHA: Like a couple on Valentine's Day. Who
forgot it was Valentine's Day.

2889
03:27:10,503 --> 03:27:13,758
ASHLEY: It looks like there's a free steak.

2890
03:27:13,758 --> 03:27:20,844
SAM: Listen, we need to go kill some things right
now, but I just want to say to all of you, I'm so

2891
03:27:20,844 --> 03:27:26,837
sorry the way I left, it was awful of me.
Percival, I said awful things to you, I said awful

2892
03:27:26,837 --> 03:27:33,384
things to all of you. But just know I've done and
said worse things to Kaylee, and she's forgiven

2893
03:27:33,384 --> 03:27:40,056
me, and I've done and said worse things to myself,
and I've managed to forgive myself, and I hope

2894
03:27:40,056 --> 03:27:48,269
that someday, you'll all be able to forgive me.
And until then, I'll just keep trying, and that's

2895
03:27:48,269 --> 03:27:54,652
all I can do. And after this fight, if you want me
to stay, and you guys go home, that's fine. But if

2896
03:27:54,652 --> 03:27:57,790
not, maybe we can start over.

2897
03:27:57,790 --> 03:28:04,548
MATT: Vex, Vax, Keyleth. At this moment, you hear
what sounds like footsteps making their way up the

2898
03:28:04,548 --> 03:28:09,972
tunnel. Not where the light was before, but the
path you previously stepped from.

2899
03:28:09,972 --> 03:28:12,166
MARISHA: Does it sound like skeletons, or
heavier?

2900
03:28:12,166 --> 03:28:18,061
MATT: From just your passing hearing, it just
sounds like patterned footsteps.

2901
03:28:18,061 --> 03:28:19,786
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on everybody.

2902
03:28:19,786 --> 03:28:20,757
MATT: Okay.

2903
03:28:20,757 --> 03:28:22,078
LIAM: Everybody quiet down.

2904
03:28:22,078 --> 03:28:26,392
MARISHA: We're inside a glowing door, I think they
know where we are.

2905
03:28:26,392 --> 03:28:32,624
MATT: So, you guys all close the door to the
mansion.

2906
03:28:32,624 --> 03:28:37,567
LAURA: Well, I don't want to close the door to the
mansion, but turn out the lights in the mansion so

2907
03:28:37,567 --> 03:28:38,983
you can't see.

2908
03:28:38,983 --> 03:28:43,186
MARISHA: No one's home! We're out of candy, no
trick-or-treating.

2909
03:28:43,186 --> 03:28:52,194
MATT: Up the hall, you watch as two humanoid
figures with hoods are carrying each side of what

2910
03:28:52,194 --> 03:28:59,925
looks like a chest or a crate that has handles.
They just pass and then continue going.

2911
03:28:59,925 --> 03:29:05,076
SAM: (whispering) You've seen that? You've seen
that? Those are the guys?

2912
03:29:05,076 --> 03:29:06,748
JON: (whispering) Those are the guys.

2913
03:29:06,748 --> 03:29:09,309
SAM: (whispering) We should kill him. Let's go
kill them.

2914
03:29:09,309 --> 03:29:11,448
LIAM: (whispering) Can I murder one first?

2915
03:29:11,448 --> 03:29:12,530
TALIESIN: (whispering) Yes.

2916
03:29:12,530 --> 03:29:13,602
LIAM: (whispering) Thank you.

2917
03:29:13,602 --> 03:29:15,010
LAURA: (whispering) Wait, I shoot--

2918
03:29:15,010 --> 03:29:16,727
MATT: You're still inside the mansion.

2919
03:29:16,727 --> 03:29:19,078
LIAM: I thought she said the door was just barely
open.

2920
03:29:19,078 --> 03:29:23,047
MATT: Yeah, but they're not walking by; you made
the door way back in the tunnel. You see them up

2921
03:29:23,047 --> 03:29:27,271
toward the T-juncture. So you guys would have to
leave the mansion and get there quickly.

2922
03:29:27,271 --> 03:29:29,156
LAURA: Shit. We sneak out. We sneak out and shoot
them from behind.

2923
03:29:29,156 --> 03:29:31,498
MATT: All right, stealth check for those who are
moving forward.

2924
03:29:31,498 --> 03:29:32,675
SAM: Maybe we should all go.

2925
03:29:32,675 --> 03:29:34,042
LIAM: Now, wait a second.

2926
03:29:34,042 --> 03:29:37,402
LAURA: If you feel like it, you can go. This is a
team.

2927
03:29:37,402 --> 03:29:38,813
TRAVIS: You Pass-Without-a-Traced us, right?

2928
03:29:38,813 --> 03:29:40,163
LAURA: Yeah.

2929
03:29:40,163 --> 03:29:45,485
MATT: Those who are moving forward, stealth
check?

2930
03:29:45,485 --> 03:29:46,794
LIAM: 43.

2931
03:29:46,794 --> 03:29:48,218
MATT: Happy hundredth.

2932
03:29:48,218 --> 03:29:49,450
MARISHA: 24.

2933
03:29:49,450 --> 03:29:50,665
LAURA: 27.

2934
03:29:50,665 --> 03:29:52,327
MATT: Anybody else moving forward with them?

2935
03:29:52,327 --> 03:29:56,121
TALIESIN: I'm a little bit behind them. 28.

2936
03:29:56,121 --> 03:29:58,572
SAM: Wait, are we all going?

2937
03:29:58,572 --> 03:30:00,075
MATT: Up to you guys. Whoever's going?

2938
03:30:00,075 --> 03:30:03,058
SAM: Did everyone else leave?

2939
03:30:03,058 --> 03:30:04,478
JON: 20.

2940
03:30:04,478 --> 03:30:06,118
SAM: If he's going, I'm going.

2941
03:30:06,118 --> 03:30:07,362
TALIESIN: I'm behind you guys.

2942
03:30:07,362 --> 03:30:08,544
SAM: Natural 20.

2943
03:30:08,544 --> 03:30:10,274
LIAM: Twins are in the front.

2944
03:30:10,274 --> 03:30:12,414
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're letting them go first.

2945
03:30:12,414 --> 03:30:14,637
JON: Oh, I'm behind, but I'm going.

2946
03:30:14,637 --> 03:30:17,384
MATT: You do have advantage on your stealth
checks because of your boots, Pike.

2947
03:30:17,384 --> 03:30:22,386
MARISHA: Table right is hanging back behind the
twins.

2948
03:30:22,386 --> 03:30:24,730
ASHLEY: 16.

2949
03:30:24,730 --> 03:30:26,097
LAURA: Plus ten?

2950
03:30:26,097 --> 03:30:28,203
ASHLEY: Oh, 26!

2951
03:30:28,203 --> 03:30:30,924
MATT: All right, everyone got above 20.

2952
03:30:30,924 --> 03:30:32,439
SAM: Taryon's still asleep.

2953
03:30:32,439 --> 03:30:33,871
LAURA: No!

2954
03:30:33,871 --> 03:30:43,260
MATT: Taryon is still asleep. Okay. All right, so.
You carefully move forward. The twins, you, at

2955
03:30:43,260 --> 03:30:47,259
full stealthing pace, make it up to the corner,
and as you crest around the side, about 20, 25

2956
03:30:47,259 --> 03:30:53,389
feet up, you see the two humanoid figures with
hoods that come to a underoff point that hangs to

2957
03:30:53,389 --> 03:30:57,823
one side. Looks like a leathery or rubbery
substance from the little bit of light that's

2958
03:30:57,823 --> 03:31:03,518
coming through, it's hard to really tell. They're
wearing long black cloth, like a tunic, and what

2959
03:31:03,518 --> 03:31:09,618
looks to be dark leather or thick black cloth,
pants and boots.

2960
03:31:09,618 --> 03:31:12,397
LAURA: Pants and boots and pants.

2961
03:31:12,397 --> 03:31:16,312
MATT: Boots and pants and boots and pants. Not
gloved hands, but they're both just carrying this

2962
03:31:16,312 --> 03:31:18,245
chest along, they're just quietly moving along.

2963
03:31:18,245 --> 03:31:19,997
LAURA: I bramble shot one of them.

2964
03:31:19,997 --> 03:31:21,575
LIAM: (dagger throwing noise)

2965
03:31:21,575 --> 03:31:26,635
MATT: Okay, so, roll for your attack. On the
one that's closest to you, or further?

2966
03:31:26,635 --> 03:31:27,995
LIAM: On the left.

2967
03:31:27,995 --> 03:31:29,610
MATT: Well, they're both moving away from you.

2968
03:31:29,610 --> 03:31:30,551
LAURA and LIAM: Oh.

2969
03:31:30,551 --> 03:31:31,642
LIAM: Well, you're further.

2970
03:31:31,642 --> 03:31:32,697
LAURA: I'll go for the further one.

2971
03:31:32,697 --> 03:31:34,378
TRAVIS: Please both be old people.

2972
03:31:34,378 --> 03:31:36,419
(laughter)

2973
03:31:36,419 --> 03:31:38,732
LAURA: Should I roll two for attack?

2974
03:31:38,732 --> 03:31:41,143
MATT: Yeah, because they do not know you're there,
so you have advantage.

2975
03:31:41,143 --> 03:31:42,794
LAURA: Ooh.

2976
03:31:42,794 --> 03:31:45,172
LIAM: 29.

2977
03:31:45,172 --> 03:31:46,377
MATT: That hits.

2978
03:31:46,377 --> 03:31:47,859
LIAM: And this is assassinate, critical hit.

2979
03:31:47,859 --> 03:31:49,111
MATT: Yes it is, it's an auto crit.

2980
03:31:49,111 --> 03:31:51,791
LAURA: So, Oh! I'm an assassin too!

2981
03:31:51,791 --> 03:31:52,874
MATT: Correct.

2982
03:31:52,874 --> 03:31:54,299
LAURA: So I get an automatic?

2983
03:31:54,299 --> 03:31:58,084
MATT: Auto crit. If you're a level three, you do.
So both you guys auto crit.

2984
03:31:58,084 --> 03:32:02,091
LAURA: Sweet!! Ooh, so I double all my dice?

2985
03:32:02,091 --> 03:32:03,262
MATT: Yep, including the bramble shot.

2986
03:32:03,262 --> 03:32:04,414
LAURA: Oh shit!

2987
03:32:04,414 --> 03:32:12,020
TALIESIN: That's the end of both of them. It's
going to be a cadaver and a fern.

2988
03:32:12,020 --> 03:32:20,956
MARISHA: Oh, new chest. We could put our blankets
in it.

2989
03:32:20,956 --> 03:32:25,354
TALIESIN: I'm working on a quilt.

2990
03:32:25,354 --> 03:32:27,547
MARISHA: I was going to say, the quilt from your
grandmother.

2991
03:32:27,547 --> 03:32:35,834
JON: This thing must be worth them dying for.

2992
03:32:35,834 --> 03:32:37,967
LAURA: 66 on the first hit.

2993
03:32:37,967 --> 03:32:40,092
MATT: 66 damage?

2994
03:32:40,092 --> 03:32:41,430
LAURA: For the arrow, yeah.

2995
03:32:41,430 --> 03:32:43,135
LIAM: 78 on the first hit.

2996
03:32:43,135 --> 03:32:47,237
LAURA: Oh wait, I didn't do my sneak attack
damage! (cackling)

2997
03:32:47,237 --> 03:32:48,917
JON: They can just obliterate anything?

2998
03:32:48,917 --> 03:32:50,811
TALIESIN: Yeah, they're monsters.

2999
03:32:50,811 --> 03:32:54,453
LIAM: And I use a bonus action for an offhand
attack. And I got a critical on it.

3000
03:32:54,453 --> 03:32:57,077
I rolled a 20.

3001
03:32:57,077 --> 03:32:59,918
MATT: You rolled a 20 on the second one? Okay.
Roll damage on that.

3002
03:32:59,918 --> 03:33:02,918
LAURA: 76 for the first hit.

3003
03:33:02,918 --> 03:33:12,611
MATT: Okay. In an instant-- don't worry about the
second attack, critical damage. Both of them just

3004
03:33:12,611 --> 03:33:15,845
go-- (footsteps) (thud)

3005
03:33:15,845 --> 03:33:17,616
(laughter)

3006
03:33:17,616 --> 03:33:24,854
ASHLEY: What's in the box?

3007
03:33:24,854 --> 03:33:26,285
TRAVIS: What's in the box?

3008
03:33:26,285 --> 03:33:28,532
MATT: You lift up the box--

3009
03:33:28,532 --> 03:33:30,151
LAURA: We check it for traps.

3010
03:33:30,151 --> 03:33:31,720
MATT: Okay, investigation check.

3011
03:33:31,720 --> 03:33:33,979
LIAM: Let's both check.

3012
03:33:33,979 --> 03:33:35,114
LAURA: Okay.

3013
03:33:35,114 --> 03:33:36,297
LIAM: Natural 20.

3014
03:33:36,297 --> 03:33:43,458
MATT: What the fuck? You guys tonight. Talk about
the hundredth episode mojo here. Unless you're

3015
03:33:43,458 --> 03:33:44,744
Grog. Sorry, buddy.

3016
03:33:44,744 --> 03:33:47,012
TRAVIS: Fucking leave it in the past!

3017
03:33:47,012 --> 03:33:53,386
MATT: All righty, so. Who rolled investigation on
that one?

3018
03:33:53,386 --> 03:33:54,574
LAURA: He did.

3019
03:33:54,574 --> 03:33:55,557
MATT: What did you get?

3020
03:33:55,557 --> 03:33:56,409
LIAM: 20.

3021
03:33:56,409 --> 03:33:59,473
MATT: 20. Natural, oh that's right, (blows
raspberry) I'm stupid. Yeah, no, it is not

3022
03:33:59,473 --> 03:34:01,506
trapped, it's not locked, it's just closed.

3023
03:34:01,506 --> 03:34:02,584
LIAM: Spick and span.

3024
03:34:02,584 --> 03:34:10,464
MATT: Inside you see what looks like a polished
stone of smooth jade that is affixed to a grey

3025
03:34:10,464 --> 03:34:17,896
leather band that loops in the back. You see a
scimitar, a very well-made scimitar, that has a

3026
03:34:17,896 --> 03:34:26,535
series of pearlescent gems across the hilt, it has
a very Marquesian flair to it. And you see what

3027
03:34:26,535 --> 03:34:31,286
appears to be a rusty iron sphere that is about
three inches in diameter and weighs about a pound.

3028
03:34:31,286 --> 03:34:36,725
It has a bunch of really strange shapes and
design, almost like it was made from condensed

3029
03:34:36,725 --> 03:34:39,008
chains that were then melted down into a single
sphere.

3030
03:34:39,008 --> 03:34:40,859
It has a really rough texture on the outside.

3031
03:34:40,859 --> 03:34:46,332
LAURA: We need to have Tary Identify it. Can we
drag the box back to the mansion?

3032
03:34:46,332 --> 03:34:51,959
MATT: Yeah, you drag it back (dragging noises). I
mean, the box has some food and blankets that are

3033
03:34:51,959 --> 03:34:56,878
meant to keep it hidden, so you search through as
you find them. Those are the only things of

3034
03:34:56,878 --> 03:34:59,277
interest in the box, the rest of it just seems to
be to fill the space.

3035
03:34:59,277 --> 03:35:00,744
LAURA: Can we hide the bodies?

3036
03:35:00,744 --> 03:35:02,848
MATT: Sure. You guys drag the bodies back?

3037
03:35:02,848 --> 03:35:07,052
LAURA: Yeah. And Dust of Tracelessness to hide
where they were dragged.

3038
03:35:07,052 --> 03:35:08,617
TALIESIN: I'm going to take their cloaks.

3039
03:35:08,617 --> 03:35:10,181
TRAVIS: You want me to hide the bodies?

3040
03:35:10,181 --> 03:35:11,037
LAURA: Yeah, Grog.

3041
03:35:11,037 --> 03:35:12,593
TRAVIS: I put the bodies in the Bag of Holding.

3042
03:35:12,593 --> 03:35:15,099
(laughter)

3043
03:35:15,099 --> 03:35:19,571
MATT: Okay. The opening is about that big, so it
takes you a second, just like when you had to put

3044
03:35:19,571 --> 03:35:26,692
Dork the Ox in there, it's like trying to fit a
king-sized pillow in a twin-sized pillowcase.

3045
03:35:26,692 --> 03:35:32,167
TALIESIN: I fully support it. Whatever you need to
do to feel better, man.

3046
03:35:32,167 --> 03:35:35,132
TRAVIS: I'm trying to get over these double ones,
man, I'm working it out.

3047
03:35:35,132 --> 03:35:38,349
TALIESIN: I'm curious about a couple things here.

3048
03:35:38,349 --> 03:35:41,822
LAURA: Don't touch any of it, until we get Tary to
look at it.

3049
03:35:41,822 --> 03:35:44,725
MARISHA: While they drag the bodies back, Percy
and I take the robes.

3050
03:35:44,725 --> 03:35:50,038
TALIESIN: We're going to strip the cult members of
their culty pants.

3051
03:35:50,038 --> 03:35:53,386
MATT: So, Percival and Keyleth are currently
wearing--

3052
03:35:53,386 --> 03:35:59,037
MARISHA: Can I study one of the guys' face, and
take that for Alter Self?

3053
03:35:59,037 --> 03:36:05,034
MATT: Sure, easy enough. You also find that both
of them have what looks like a dark iron symbol

3054
03:36:05,034 --> 03:36:12,194
hanging around their neck, hidden beneath their
robes. It resembles a four-pronged pitchfork that

3055
03:36:12,194 --> 03:36:15,069
has a single rod beneath it that forms a loop.

3056
03:36:15,069 --> 03:36:17,289
LAURA: Do you have a picture?

3057
03:36:17,289 --> 03:36:18,844
MATT: I'm going to sketch it for you.

3058
03:36:18,844 --> 03:36:20,980
SAM: Dickbutt.

3059
03:36:20,980 --> 03:36:28,118
LAURA: I spilled coffee on my paper, and it looks
like David Mack watercolor.

3060
03:36:28,118 --> 03:36:30,689
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, it's aged a little.

3061
03:36:30,689 --> 03:36:32,690
LIAM: Mack spatter.

3062
03:36:32,690 --> 03:36:36,924
SAM: Hey, in the store tonight, we've got lots
of--

3063
03:36:36,924 --> 03:36:38,638
MATT: It looks like that.

3064
03:36:38,638 --> 03:36:42,819
TALIESIN: Angry happy face with a goatee.

3065
03:36:42,819 --> 03:36:48,759
MATT: Kind of, yeah. So you have the corpses both
being stuffed into the Bag of Holding, you guys

3066
03:36:48,759 --> 03:36:51,789
find the whatever symbols are hanging, and the
robes are on you.

3067
03:36:51,789 --> 03:36:53,456
LAURA: We go back to Tary.

3068
03:36:53,456 --> 03:36:54,900
MATT: You go back to Tary.

3069
03:36:54,900 --> 03:36:59,846
SAM: (as Tary) 34, 35. Other side, Doty. One.

3070
03:36:59,846 --> 03:37:02,545
LAURA: Tary? We're in the mansion. Tary?

3071
03:37:02,545 --> 03:37:04,751
SAM: Hello? Yes? I'm not decent yet.

3072
03:37:04,751 --> 03:37:06,877
LAURA: Tary. I've seen you naked.

3073
03:37:06,877 --> 03:37:09,863
SAM: Come in, come in. Hello.

3074
03:37:09,863 --> 03:37:14,142
LIAM: Thank you. We have a box of crazy shit, will
you look at it and tell us what we're looking at?

3075
03:37:14,142 --> 03:37:15,222
SAM: Of course.

3076
03:37:15,222 --> 03:37:18,110
LAURA: What are you doing in here, why didn't you
come down with us?

3077
03:37:18,110 --> 03:37:23,962
SAM: I'm doing my daily preparations. I had to
pluck my eyebrows, I had to comb my hair. My

3078
03:37:23,962 --> 03:37:26,230
unmentionables needed to be washed and--

3079
03:37:26,230 --> 03:37:27,553
JON: Waxed?

3080
03:37:27,553 --> 03:37:33,077
SAM: Yes. I will identify these objects.

3081
03:37:33,077 --> 03:37:36,869
MATT: Easy enough to do as a ritual for each. The
scimitar is a Scimitar of Speed.

3082
03:37:36,869 --> 03:37:38,813
TALIESIN: I'm excited.

3083
03:37:38,813 --> 03:37:40,539
SAM: Oh, oh. I'm jacked in.

3084
03:37:40,539 --> 03:37:43,577
LAURA: You can go, you can go, you've got 30 feet
of jack.

3085
03:37:43,577 --> 03:37:47,322
MATT: All right, don't go so far. These are the
other two items you've got.

3086
03:37:47,322 --> 03:37:48,966
SAM: Oh my god, there's so many items.

3087
03:37:48,966 --> 03:37:51,664
LAURA: Whoa, go us!

3088
03:37:51,664 --> 03:37:56,632
SAM: What we have here is a Scimitar of Speed. You
gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made

3089
03:37:56,632 --> 03:38:01,849
with this magical weapon. In addition, you can
make one attack with it as a bonus action on each

3090
03:38:01,849 --> 03:38:02,938
of your turns.

3091
03:38:02,938 --> 03:38:04,899
LAURA: Shut up. Is it attunable? Do you have to
attune it?

3092
03:38:04,899 --> 03:38:06,345
TALIESIN: Yes, you do.

3093
03:38:06,345 --> 03:38:14,047
SAM: But maybe this guy can do it. We've also
found the Third Eye of Awareness. A single

3094
03:38:14,047 --> 03:38:19,418
polished stone of smooth jade is affixed to a grey
leather band that loops in the back. The wearer

3095
03:38:19,418 --> 03:38:21,309
gains advantage on initiative.

3096
03:38:21,309 --> 03:38:22,550
(gasps)

3097
03:38:22,550 --> 03:38:24,204
SAM: Not attunable.

3098
03:38:24,204 --> 03:38:25,656
(louder excited gasps)

3099
03:38:25,656 --> 03:38:27,225
LAURA: We're in the room, we're in the room!

3100
03:38:27,225 --> 03:38:29,858
LIAM: Tary, I am an assassin of the highest
caliber.

3101
03:38:29,858 --> 03:38:32,044
LAURA: Tary. I'm your best friend.

3102
03:38:32,044 --> 03:38:36,610
SAM: Oh. Little Elf Girl.

3103
03:38:36,610 --> 03:38:38,470
LAURA: Oh wait, is it a necklace?

3104
03:38:38,470 --> 03:38:42,198
SAM: No, it's a leather band.

3105
03:38:42,198 --> 03:38:43,937
MATT: It's a headband.

3106
03:38:43,937 --> 03:38:49,358
SAM: Of course Vex gets this. All the times we've
had together.

3107
03:38:49,358 --> 03:38:58,005
JON: What are the other Eyes of Awareness? Have
you guys come across the others? It says that's

3108
03:38:58,005 --> 03:38:59,410
the third one.

3109
03:38:59,410 --> 03:39:06,458
SAM: The last item is called the Iron Bands of
Bilarro. This rusty iron sphere measures three

3110
03:39:06,458 --> 03:39:10,039
inches in diameter, and weighs one pound. Like my
dick.

3111
03:39:10,039 --> 03:39:11,961
(laughter)

3112
03:39:11,961 --> 03:39:14,095
LIAM: It says that on the paper, Matt?

3113
03:39:14,095 --> 03:39:18,725
MATT: I didn't-- no-- I didn't-- Wait-- No.

3114
03:39:18,725 --> 03:39:20,495
MARISHA: Wait, does that require attunement?

3115
03:39:20,495 --> 03:39:26,073
SAM: You can use an action to speak the command
word and throw the sphere at a huge or smaller

3116
03:39:26,073 --> 03:39:32,597
creature, like my dick, that you can see within 60
feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air,

3117
03:39:32,597 --> 03:39:38,042
it opens into a tangle of metal bands, like my
dick. Make a ranged attack roll with an attack

3118
03:39:38,042 --> 03:39:43,534
bonus equal to your dex modifier plus your blah
blah blah, if you hit it, the target is restrained

3119
03:39:43,534 --> 03:39:49,154
until you take a bonus action to speak a command
word and release it. Doing so, or missing, causes

3120
03:39:49,154 --> 03:39:53,769
the bands to contract and become a sphere once
more. So it's like a trap ball. Trap ball.

3121
03:39:53,769 --> 03:40:01,220
MATT: It's like, you know in Doctor Strange, that
prison exoskeleton it threw on him?

3122
03:40:01,220 --> 03:40:02,418
It's like that.

3123
03:40:02,418 --> 03:40:07,234
SAM: Once the band is used, it can't be used again
until the next dawn, like my dick.

3124
03:40:07,234 --> 03:40:14,212
LAURA: Tary, you've never been quite so obsessed
with your dick before.

3125
03:40:14,212 --> 03:40:20,183
SAM: It's just that gnome, he's so weird and he
rubs off on people, like my dick!

3126
03:40:20,183 --> 03:40:21,542
Oh, I'm doing it again!

3127
03:40:21,542 --> 03:40:24,610
LAURA: You're doing it! How are you? You've been
hiding a lot!

3128
03:40:24,610 --> 03:40:29,781
SAM: Well, it seems like you guys are working
through a thing, and I should really be getting

3129
03:40:29,781 --> 03:40:35,639
back home, anyway. I don't know, I don't feel
quite as needed any more.

3130
03:40:35,639 --> 03:40:36,910
LAURA: Oh no!

3131
03:40:36,910 --> 03:40:38,415
JON: You're not, I don't think.

3132
03:40:38,415 --> 03:40:39,375
LAURA: You're not there!

3133
03:40:39,419 --> 03:40:41,029
SAM: How did he get in here?

3134
03:40:41,029 --> 03:40:43,626
MATT: You turn around and realize that Lionel has
followed you into the room.

3135
03:40:43,626 --> 03:40:46,725
JON: What else do I have to do?

3136
03:40:46,725 --> 03:40:55,104
SAM: After this is all done, I'll say my proper
goodbyes. But I should be going. He's your best

3137
03:40:55,104 --> 03:40:59,091
guy, right? You need him. He's part of the team,
he always has been.

3138
03:40:59,091 --> 03:41:01,005
LAURA: <i>You're</i> my best guy!

3139
03:41:01,005 --> 03:41:09,060
SAM: I love you both. I'm definitely poorer for
having known you, though.

3140
03:41:09,060 --> 03:41:16,186
LAURA: I mean, you were poorer without knowing us,
you just didn't realize it.

3141
03:41:16,186 --> 03:41:17,893
LIAM: I mean, poorer, but richer.

3142
03:41:17,893 --> 03:41:19,596
SAM: That's true.

3143
03:41:19,596 --> 03:41:22,264
TRAVIS: Your family's actually poorer because of
you.

3144
03:41:22,264 --> 03:41:27,913
LAURA: This mansion disappears in 24 hours, so you
can't just hide in here.

3145
03:41:27,913 --> 03:41:36,006
SAM: All right, I'll come outside. Doty, get my
armor ready. Spritz it!

3146
03:41:36,006 --> 03:41:44,015
MATT: "Tary." Doty pulls an arm up, and you can
see one of the slight changes that they had made

3147
03:41:44,015 --> 03:41:49,561
in his construction is a slight mister on the
other hand that goes (water spraying).

3148
03:41:49,561 --> 03:41:52,537
TRAVIS: For your face or for your armor?

3149
03:41:52,537 --> 03:41:54,032
SAM: His armor!

3150
03:41:54,032 --> 03:41:54,804
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

3151
03:41:54,804 --> 03:41:56,489
MATT: Depends how hot the day is.

3152
03:41:56,489 --> 03:41:58,285
LIAM: Freddie! Where's Fred?

3153
03:41:58,285 --> 03:42:04,265
LAURA: I feel like Percy would like this a lot. We
found something that you might enjoy.

3154
03:42:04,265 --> 03:42:06,457
LIAM: What's this?

3155
03:42:06,457 --> 03:42:08,115
TALIESIN: Scimitar of Speed.

3156
03:42:08,115 --> 03:42:13,464
LIAM: Well, I think you might like this thing. You
could come up with

3157
03:42:13,464 --> 03:42:15,873
very creative solutions with that.

3158
03:42:15,873 --> 03:42:23,030
TALIESIN: This could go-- (interested noises) Yes.
Yes, I think I could do something with this.

3159
03:42:23,030 --> 03:42:32,106
SAM: Let's go kill some shit, shall we? Come on!

3160
03:42:32,106 --> 03:42:34,325
TALIESIN: I've even got a codeword for it!

3161
03:42:34,325 --> 03:42:35,398
SAM: Codeword?

3162
03:42:35,398 --> 03:42:36,468
MARISHA: There's a codeword?

3163
03:42:36,468 --> 03:42:38,377
TALIESIN: You have to speak a word to make it
work.

3164
03:42:38,377 --> 03:42:39,603
MATT: A command word, yeah.

3165
03:42:39,603 --> 03:42:43,186
TALIESIN: Can I program the word? I've programmed
it. Perfect.

3166
03:42:43,186 --> 03:42:45,794
LAURA: I put this on.

3167
03:42:45,794 --> 03:42:51,371
MATT: Okay, you put that on. All right. Who is
going where? What are you doing?

3168
03:42:51,371 --> 03:42:56,922
LIAM: Wait, hold on. Would you like this, either
of you? It's not my bag.

3169
03:42:56,922 --> 03:43:02,247
ASHLEY: Gain a plus two bonus to attack... It's a
weapon.

3170
03:43:02,247 --> 03:43:07,084
MATT: All right, so what's the plan, guys? What
are you doing?

3171
03:43:07,084 --> 03:43:08,761
LIAM: We should go.

3172
03:43:08,761 --> 03:43:10,263
LAURA: We should go attack things.

3173
03:43:10,263 --> 03:43:11,288
TRAVIS: Campfire!

3174
03:43:11,288 --> 03:43:14,351
LIAM: Well, let's go quietly, you and I, take
point.

3175
03:43:14,351 --> 03:43:19,717
LAURA: And head deeper in, see where the people
have been.

3176
03:43:19,717 --> 03:43:21,130
LIAM: Twins are in the lead.

3177
03:43:21,130 --> 03:43:23,094
MATT: New stealth checks from you guys since
you've had combat.

3178
03:43:23,094 --> 03:43:24,819
LAURA: Still have Pass Without a Trace going.

3179
03:43:24,819 --> 03:43:27,289
TALIESIN: Everybody roll who's walking.

3180
03:43:27,289 --> 03:43:30,625
MATT: Sam, are you bringing Scanlan?

3181
03:43:30,625 --> 03:43:32,736
LAURA: Natural 20!

3182
03:43:32,736 --> 03:43:38,352
MATT: So, across the board.

3183
03:43:38,352 --> 03:43:40,170
TRAVIS: What are we rolling?

3184
03:43:40,170 --> 03:43:41,306
MATT: Stealth.

3185
03:43:41,306 --> 03:43:42,720
TRAVIS: Oh, I did that already. 23.

3186
03:43:42,720 --> 03:43:45,900
ASHLEY: 35!

3187
03:43:45,900 --> 03:43:49,619
LAURA: Natural 20.

3188
03:43:49,619 --> 03:43:53,897
LIAM: I rolled a two, so it's a 27.

3189
03:43:53,897 --> 03:43:56,482
MATT: Reliable Talent, man, it's awesome.

3190
03:43:56,482 --> 03:43:57,545
MARISHA: 29.

3191
03:43:57,545 --> 03:43:58,897
TALIESIN: 23.

3192
03:43:58,897 --> 03:44:00,063
JON: 19.

3193
03:44:00,063 --> 03:44:00,969
MATT: Plus ten.

3194
03:44:00,969 --> 03:44:02,243
JON: Yeah, that was with ten.

3195
03:44:02,243 --> 03:44:04,093
SAM: 20, 23, 23.

3196
03:44:04,093 --> 03:44:05,731
MATT: Okay!

3197
03:44:05,731 --> 03:44:06,776
ASHLEY: Question!

3198
03:44:06,776 --> 03:44:12,244
SAM: Scanlan, Taryon, Doty. I tried to leave them
behind, guys!

3199
03:44:12,244 --> 03:44:16,723
LAURA: But he's in a mansion, he'll just pop out
and then he'll be sitting in a tunnel by himself!

3200
03:44:16,723 --> 03:44:18,599
TRAVIS: You opened this hole, man, you gotta pay
for it!

3201
03:44:18,599 --> 03:44:20,020
LIAM: Yeah, you've got to juggle these balls.

3202
03:44:20,176 --> 03:44:21,384
MATT: All righty.

3203
03:44:21,443 --> 03:44:25,856
LAURA: Sorry, Matt. What do we do? He's going to
kill him! He's going to kill one of them! What

3204
03:44:25,856 --> 03:44:29,033
should we do?

3205
03:44:29,033 --> 03:44:30,377
SAM: Let's go!

3206
03:44:30,377 --> 03:44:32,424
MATT: You move further into the tunnel.

3207
03:44:32,424 --> 03:44:36,107
LIAM: Twins in the lead, point, traps. All that.

3208
03:44:36,107 --> 03:44:37,125
MATT: All right.

3209
03:44:37,125 --> 03:44:39,915
LAURA: Searching, keeping an eye out for any other
people as well.

3210
03:44:39,915 --> 03:44:47,949
MATT: All right, it's only 80 feet until the
winding tunnel opens up slightly. So, make another

3211
03:44:47,949 --> 03:44:51,087
investigation check partway up, about halfway to
that period.

3212
03:44:51,087 --> 03:44:52,674
LAURA: God damn it.

3213
03:44:52,674 --> 03:44:53,832
LIAM: 18.

3214
03:44:53,832 --> 03:45:09,317
MATT: Okay. You make your way there. And you begin
to push towards the entranceway. The soft dust on

3215
03:45:09,317 --> 03:45:16,818
the ground, which is the same color as the rest of
the stonework. Vax, you step onto one section that

3216
03:45:16,818 --> 03:45:22,709
seems to step in a little further than the others, and you
feel a (click).

3217
03:45:22,709 --> 03:45:25,651
LIAM: Nobody move. Don't move.

3218
03:45:25,651 --> 03:45:30,550
MATT: I need you and Vex, and who was following
them?

3219
03:45:30,550 --> 03:45:32,780
SAM: Everybody.

3220
03:45:32,780 --> 03:45:36,909
MATT: I need everybody to make a constitution
saving throw.

3221
03:45:36,909 --> 03:45:38,544
LAURA: Oh no.

3222
03:45:38,544 --> 03:45:45,203
SAM: Saving throws are up there.

3223
03:45:45,203 --> 03:45:48,262
LIAM: Sam. I'm using my first Luck of the new day.
Okay?

3224
03:45:48,262 --> 03:45:50,113
SAM: Great. That's the third one, then?

3225
03:45:50,113 --> 03:45:52,550
LIAM: The first one of the day.

3226
03:45:52,550 --> 03:45:56,166
TALIESIN: Oh, I can reroll a saving throw.

3227
03:45:56,166 --> 03:46:02,530
MATT: All right. Grog?

3228
03:46:02,530 --> 03:46:03,979
TRAVIS: 17.

3229
03:46:03,979 --> 03:46:07,067
MATT: 17. You take 36 points of necrotic damage.
Pike?

3230
03:46:07,067 --> 03:46:08,250
ASHLEY: Five.

3231
03:46:08,250 --> 03:46:09,783
MATT: 36 points of necrotic damage.

3232
03:46:09,783 --> 03:46:11,466
LIAM: Constitution saving throw?

3233
03:46:11,466 --> 03:46:12,919
MATT: Yep. Vex?

3234
03:46:12,919 --> 03:46:14,012
LAURA: 16?

3235
03:46:14,012 --> 03:46:15,352
MATT: 36 points of necrotic damage.

3236
03:46:15,352 --> 03:46:20,703
LIAM: 18, but armor after those faces, is set to
necrotic damage.

3237
03:46:20,703 --> 03:46:27,743
MATT: Right, because you never un-set it from
that. Okay. All right, I'll let you do that. All

3238
03:46:27,743 --> 03:46:32,527
right, so instead of 36, that's 18.

3239
03:46:32,527 --> 03:46:34,172
LIAM: I rolled an 18.

3240
03:46:34,172 --> 03:46:38,129
MATT: You did not succeed on the saving throw, but
you halved it.

3241
03:46:38,129 --> 03:46:40,950
MARISHA: 20 total?

3242
03:46:40,950 --> 03:46:44,305
MATT: 20 total? You take 16 points of necrotic
damage. You make it.

3243
03:46:44,305 --> 03:46:47,530
TALIESIN: Out of curiosity, is this a magic saving
throw?

3244
03:46:47,530 --> 03:46:51,167
MATT: Against a spell effect? Yes.

3245
03:46:51,167 --> 03:46:55,302
TALIESIN: Then I don't even have to use a resolve.
19.

3246
03:46:55,302 --> 03:46:58,182
MATT: 19 does not succeed. You take 36 points of
necrotic damage.

3247
03:46:58,182 --> 03:46:59,790
JON: 16.

3248
03:46:59,790 --> 03:47:01,300
MATT: 36 points of necrotic damage.

3249
03:47:01,300 --> 03:47:04,337
TALIESIN: We don't have the bonus hit points,
either, do we?

3250
03:47:04,337 --> 03:47:05,444
MATT: Nope.

3251
03:47:05,444 --> 03:47:06,447
TALIESIN: Okay.

3252
03:47:06,447 --> 03:47:07,828
SAM: Scanlan, 26.

3253
03:47:07,828 --> 03:47:09,467
MATT: Takes 16 points of necrotic damage.

3254
03:47:09,467 --> 03:47:11,510
SAM: Is it 18 points?

3255
03:47:11,510 --> 03:47:12,923
MATT: Yes, 18.

3256
03:47:12,923 --> 03:47:15,420
SAM: Taryon, 26.

3257
03:47:15,420 --> 03:47:17,681
MATT: Wow. 18 points of necrotic damage.

3258
03:47:17,681 --> 03:47:19,294
SAM: Doty, one.

3259
03:47:19,294 --> 03:47:26,308
MATT: Doty takes 36 points of necrotic damage. All
righty. You watch as you pull back and the sand

3260
03:47:26,308 --> 03:47:33,271
sifts in and you see another face below, with a
burst of dark energy that echoes out in a 60-foot

3261
03:47:33,271 --> 03:47:38,667
radius. Fills the hallway with this high-pitched
shrieking sound. As it hits all of you and the

3262
03:47:38,667 --> 03:47:45,927
breath escapes you for a second, this circle of
death-like sphere passes all of you, and you hear

3263
03:47:45,927 --> 03:47:48,268
the shriek echo through both sides of the
hallway.

3264
03:47:48,268 --> 03:47:53,699
LAURA: Well, if anything's going to bring more
skeletons, it's that.

3265
03:47:53,699 --> 03:47:55,482
LIAM: Clicking my boots.

3266
03:47:55,482 --> 03:48:01,378
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn my quick heal. Might
as well.

3267
03:48:01,378 --> 03:48:04,401
MATT: What are you guys doing? Pushing forward,
staying where you are?

3268
03:48:04,401 --> 03:48:08,753
LAURA: Should you heal us before we pop into
anything more? Can you heal us?

3269
03:48:08,753 --> 03:48:10,560
ASHLEY: Yeah. I can heal us.

3270
03:48:10,560 --> 03:48:11,953
LAURA: That was a lot.

3271
03:48:11,953 --> 03:48:13,366
ASHLEY: That was a lot.

3272
03:48:13,366 --> 03:48:14,682
LIAM: I'm doing this.

3273
03:48:14,682 --> 03:48:17,405
MATT: Perception check.

3274
03:48:17,405 --> 03:48:20,018
ASHLEY: I'll cast Mass Cure Wounds.

3275
03:48:20,018 --> 03:48:24,057
TRAVIS: Pike's doing this.

3276
03:48:24,057 --> 03:48:26,358
MATT: Mass Cure Wounds. How much does that heal
everybody?

3277
03:48:26,358 --> 03:48:28,970
ASHLEY: 3d8 plus spellcasting ability modifier.

3278
03:48:28,970 --> 03:48:32,521
MATT: So whatever you roll plus five.

3279
03:48:32,521 --> 03:48:34,195
LIAM: 31 perception.

3280
03:48:34,195 --> 03:48:43,407
MATT: Okay. You listen out, and you hear what
sounds like low voices, things shifting, a slight

3281
03:48:43,407 --> 03:48:52,856
general humming sound. The bright light that was
there before is not there at the moment. You still

3282
03:48:52,856 --> 03:48:54,200
see the fire.

3283
03:48:54,200 --> 03:48:56,234
LIAM: Does it sound like anything I've ever heard
before?

3284
03:48:56,234 --> 03:49:00,819
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

3285
03:49:00,819 --> 03:49:04,226
ASHLEY: Everybody heals an extra 18 hit points.

3286
03:49:04,226 --> 03:49:05,780
LIAM: Natural 20.

3287
03:49:05,780 --> 03:49:13,231
MATT: Natural 20. You do remember it. The low hum
that temporarily appears was very close to the

3288
03:49:13,231 --> 03:49:16,906
sound whenever anybody was throwing something into
the dark sphere above the ziggurat.

3289
03:49:16,906 --> 03:49:19,407
LIAM: I was wondering. All right.

3290
03:49:19,407 --> 03:49:20,769
SAM: You said 18?

3291
03:49:20,769 --> 03:49:21,910
ASHLEY: 18 points, yeah.

3292
03:49:21,910 --> 03:49:23,068
JON: They've heard that before.

3293
03:49:23,068 --> 03:49:25,351
MATT: Apparently. A different one.

3294
03:49:25,351 --> 03:49:29,083
MARISHA: No one's rolled initiative. No one knows
we're here yet.

3295
03:49:29,083 --> 03:49:34,106
MATT: Not yet. You haven't thrown into combat yet.
You guys just hit a trap and heard things ahead.

3296
03:49:34,106 --> 03:49:39,368
MARISHA: If you can wait 60 seconds, I can make us
an elemental.

3297
03:49:39,368 --> 03:49:44,264
TALIESIN: Will the magic fade if we get too close
to the ziggurat, though?

3298
03:49:44,264 --> 03:49:49,120
LAURA: Maybe we'll have to fight things outside of
the ziggurat.

3299
03:49:49,120 --> 03:49:55,329
MARISHA: That's a good question. I have a mild
confession, and maybe I should have said this a

3300
03:49:55,329 --> 03:50:04,127
little earlier, but I'm going to say it now. One
night, I might have sneaked down into the middle

3301
03:50:04,127 --> 03:50:07,398
of the ziggurat, and I stuck my hand in it.

3302
03:50:07,398 --> 03:50:09,118
LAURA: What the fuck?

3303
03:50:09,118 --> 03:50:10,767
SAM: Why would you do that, and what happened?

3304
03:50:10,767 --> 03:50:17,546
MARISHA: Well, I wanted to find out what would
happen, and I found out it's real bad. It's really

3305
03:50:17,546 --> 03:50:23,785
bad, is what I found out, and it nearly crushed my
hand to a point of oblivion and I think I got

3306
03:50:23,785 --> 03:50:31,904
really lucky, so I think it just crushes anything
that it tries to suck in.

3307
03:50:31,904 --> 03:50:34,847
LAURA: But it's a doorway. I shot an arrow through
it.

3308
03:50:34,847 --> 03:50:40,128
MARISHA: It is. I think your arrow happened to be
tiny and fast.

3309
03:50:40,128 --> 03:50:42,036
TALIESIN: Well.

3310
03:50:42,036 --> 03:50:44,582
LIAM: Those 60 seconds have passed.

3311
03:50:44,582 --> 03:50:45,746
TALIESIN: Let's go.

3312
03:50:45,746 --> 03:50:51,326
MATT: You were talking instead of casting a spell.
Do you want to take

3313
03:50:51,326 --> 03:50:53,211
another minute to cast a spell?

3314
03:50:53,211 --> 03:50:55,333
TRAVIS: Thanks for the confession, though.

3315
03:50:55,333 --> 03:50:57,490
MATT: All right, so what are you guys doing?

3316
03:50:57,490 --> 03:51:00,291
LAURA: Moving forward. Keeping an eye out for
those--

3317
03:51:00,291 --> 03:51:04,250
MARISHA: That's all I mean. Don't jump in.

3318
03:51:04,250 --> 03:51:05,700
LIAM: Do you want to go elemental?

3319
03:51:05,700 --> 03:51:06,880
LAURA: No, she wanted to summon an elemental.

3320
03:51:06,880 --> 03:51:08,418
MARISHA: I wanted to summon an elemental.

3321
03:51:08,418 --> 03:51:14,168
MATT: You guys rush forward, and a hot wind is
picking up through the tunnel. You're not quite

3322
03:51:14,168 --> 03:51:19,334
sure directionally where it's coming from. But as
you move forward and through the winding passage,

3323
03:51:19,334 --> 03:51:25,634
maybe 60 feet ahead as it opens up, you see it
splits into two different pathways of natural

3324
03:51:25,634 --> 03:51:31,808
interior rock formations, and you can see a larger
chamber beyond that. You have the right and left.

3325
03:51:31,808 --> 03:51:33,484
LAURA: I pop Trinket out.

3326
03:51:33,484 --> 03:51:38,092
MATT: Okay. Trinket pops out of your necklace.
What are you guys doing?

3327
03:51:38,092 --> 03:51:44,994
LAURA: Can I hear the noise of the ziggurat coming
from either side more?

3328
03:51:44,994 --> 03:51:47,405
MATT: You hear it coming from both sides.

3329
03:51:47,405 --> 03:51:50,656
TRAVIS: Let's split up.

3330
03:51:50,656 --> 03:51:53,223
LAURA: What about wind or anything?

3331
03:51:53,223 --> 03:51:57,496
MATT: There's the general wind in the room, but
it's (whoosh) whipping around you, picking up sand

3332
03:51:57,496 --> 03:51:58,974
and dust from the ground.

3333
03:51:58,974 --> 03:52:03,382
LAURA: Do we see faces on either side?

3334
03:52:03,382 --> 03:52:05,313
MATT: Perception check.

3335
03:52:05,313 --> 03:52:08,731
LIAM: I'll have a look, as well.

3336
03:52:08,731 --> 03:52:12,262
LAURA: 28.

3337
03:52:12,262 --> 03:52:13,272
LIAM: 24.

3338
03:52:13,272 --> 03:52:16,860
MATT: Okay. You do not see any faces immediately
within the two paths that are ahead of you.

3339
03:52:16,860 --> 03:52:22,857
However, as you glance past one of the edges,
within the chamber, you can see the sources of

3340
03:52:22,857 --> 03:52:29,849
some of that flickering firelight. You see two
clay bowls, large clay bowls that are set in the

3341
03:52:29,849 --> 03:52:35,930
ground that have burning materials inside. Wood,
cloth. Who knows what, but they're burning this

3342
03:52:35,930 --> 03:52:42,913
bright orange-red flame. Not a natural yellow
flame. A deep orange-red flame. It's causing this

3343
03:52:42,913 --> 03:52:46,124
glow to emanate around the room, and you see the
flames flickering and moving with the wind that's

3344
03:52:46,124 --> 03:52:47,261
blowing about.

3345
03:52:47,261 --> 03:52:51,303
TRAVIS: Safe to assume this goes to the same room,
yeah? Just two different entrances?

3346
03:52:51,303 --> 03:52:52,687
LAURA: Maybe.

3347
03:52:52,687 --> 03:52:54,027
TRAVIS: So let's flank.

3348
03:52:54,027 --> 03:52:55,449
LAURA: I feel like there's traps.

3349
03:52:55,449 --> 03:52:59,411
MARISHA: I go with Percy, since we have the robes
over top of us.

3350
03:52:59,411 --> 03:53:03,351
MATT: All right. Who's going left and right?

3351
03:53:03,351 --> 03:53:04,502
TRAVIS: I'm going right.

3352
03:53:04,502 --> 03:53:05,933
JON: I'll go left.

3353
03:53:05,933 --> 03:53:07,022
ASHLEY: I'm going right.

3354
03:53:07,022 --> 03:53:08,730
MATT: Left?

3355
03:53:08,730 --> 03:53:10,542
LIAM: I'll roll with Percy and Keyleth.

3356
03:53:10,542 --> 03:53:15,239
MATT: Percy and Keyleth with Vax. Grog on the
right. Who else is on the right?

3357
03:53:15,239 --> 03:53:16,518
LAURA: I'll go right.

3358
03:53:16,518 --> 03:53:21,104
MATT: Vex is right. Pike? Right or left?

3359
03:53:21,104 --> 03:53:22,395
ASHLEY: Yeah, right.

3360
03:53:22,395 --> 03:53:23,874
MATT: Trinket's with you.

3361
03:53:23,874 --> 03:53:26,600
SAM: All my people to the right.

3362
03:53:26,600 --> 03:53:37,067
MATT: All righty. Indeed, what looked like two
different hallways was one entrance to the chamber

3363
03:53:37,067 --> 03:53:41,521
that was divided by a singular column in the
center. You both flank around as it opens up

3364
03:53:41,521 --> 03:53:50,353
inside. You see a 50-foot-tall, 70-foot-wide
natural cavern chamber that rounds out over the

3365
03:53:50,353 --> 03:53:58,024
top, and you see it end on the opposite side.
There are two pillars nearer to your end that both

3366
03:53:58,024 --> 03:54:05,249
hold defaced statues of a woman on each. Defaced
statues of a woman. Partially destroyed and

3367
03:54:05,249 --> 03:54:11,780
collapsed. There are elements of it broken on the
ground. The heads removed. In the center of the

3368
03:54:11,780 --> 03:54:18,192
chamber, you see before you a massive
stone-stepped pyramid, similar to the ziggurat

3369
03:54:18,192 --> 03:54:22,475
you've found. The design is a little different,
and you get the sense that a lot of it is still

3370
03:54:22,475 --> 03:54:28,001
buried and it's just the top that has been
uncovered and repurposed for whatever this may be.

3371
03:54:28,001 --> 03:54:39,059
You do see, there are a number of cloaked figures
scattered across these steps, and some of them are

3372
03:54:39,059 --> 03:54:44,291
out looking in your direction as soon as you come
around the side. They're all wearing the same

3373
03:54:44,291 --> 03:54:47,594
black outfits, the cloaks. Some of them have the
hoods back; some of them have the hoods on.

3374
03:54:47,594 --> 03:54:58,066
Roughly, you have what looks to be six or seven
from what you can view. There are two of them at

3375
03:54:58,066 --> 03:55:04,079
the very top that currently have what looks like
another crate that has been opened, and there

3376
03:55:04,079 --> 03:55:13,972
above them, you can see the black orb, exactly
like the one you have underneath Whitestone, and

3377
03:55:13,972 --> 03:55:18,561
they're in the process of taking objects out and
throwing them up into the sphere, and you watch as

3378
03:55:18,561 --> 03:55:24,372
they flash and vanish into the darkness. You see
one cloaked figure that's currently shouting out

3379
03:55:24,372 --> 03:55:26,038
and giving commands right now.

3380
03:55:26,038 --> 03:55:27,455
LAURA: Do they see us?

3381
03:55:27,455 --> 03:55:33,250
MATT: With all of your stealth? You got a 19,
correct? One of them shouts out,

3382
03:55:33,250 --> 03:55:36,614
"We have visitors!"

3383
03:55:36,614 --> 03:55:43,720
LAURA: Do they only see that side? Do they see us
come around the other side of the pillar? They see

3384
03:55:43,720 --> 03:55:44,934
all of us.

3385
03:55:44,934 --> 03:55:51,424
MATT: As soon as they all glance over, you guys
are out in the open of a hallway. Once they see

3386
03:55:51,424 --> 03:56:00,862
him, they see the spread of you. As this happens,
you watch as a number of skeletons walk out from

3387
03:56:00,862 --> 03:56:06,943
the halls on the sides, and one seems to suddenly
shake and rise up from the ground: a large

3388
03:56:06,943 --> 03:56:11,203
skeleton with what looks like giant horns that
curve out of the head, standing about 12 feet

3389
03:56:11,203 --> 03:56:16,148
tall. Looks to be some sort of minotaur-like
beast, but bone and anger.

3390
03:56:16,148 --> 03:56:20,002
LAURA: How far away is the ziggurat?

3391
03:56:20,002 --> 03:56:23,222
MATT: The ziggurat from you guys? Let's pull out a
map.

3392
03:56:23,222 --> 03:56:29,031
(cheering)

3393
03:56:29,031 --> 03:56:30,181
ASHLEY: Do you need help?

3394
03:56:30,181 --> 03:56:33,672
MATT: I may be able to get this here.

3395
03:56:33,672 --> 03:56:35,313
LAURA: It's such a big map.

3396
03:56:35,313 --> 03:56:40,438
MATT: It's a big one. Actually, Travis, do you
want to help me with this real fast?

3397
03:56:40,438 --> 03:56:42,174
JON: This time, it's big.

3398
03:56:42,174 --> 03:56:45,014
MATT: We're working out the kinks here, guys.
Thank you very much.

3399
03:56:45,014 --> 03:56:49,931
SAM: Guys. So many great things available in the
store tonight. Those posters?

3400
03:56:49,931 --> 03:56:54,606
The Scanlan thing. Oh shit.

3401
03:56:54,606 --> 03:56:57,455
LIAM: Combat. Here we go! This is the real deal.

3402
03:56:57,455 --> 03:56:59,133
LAURA: Wait, we didn't do this last time, did we?

3403
03:56:59,133 --> 03:57:01,300
JON: If I hadn't sneezed, you guys, we never would
have seen this.

3404
03:57:01,300 --> 03:57:07,761
TALIESIN: They would all be dead right now. We
would have taken them all out in one clean kill.

3405
03:57:07,761 --> 03:57:10,950
JON: We would have quietly (blow gun sounds).

3406
03:57:10,950 --> 03:57:14,889
SAM: An overhead cam? An out-of-focus overhead
cam?

3407
03:57:14,889 --> 03:57:19,935
JON: This is the place, guys.

3408
03:57:19,935 --> 03:57:21,818
LAURA: Wait, so it's reversed?

3409
03:57:21,818 --> 03:57:25,934
SAM: Matt only has to manage 22 individual
characters right now.

3410
03:57:25,934 --> 03:57:27,933
MATT: No, it's great, guys. I love it; it's
wonderful.

3411
03:57:27,933 --> 03:57:32,184
LAURA: So when we tell you which direction we want
to go, Matt, it's from your perspective.

3412
03:57:32,184 --> 03:57:35,546
MATT: Well, do the best you can to see.

3413
03:57:35,546 --> 03:57:37,782
TRAVIS: The map's right.

3414
03:57:37,782 --> 03:57:41,823
TALIESIN: Towards and away from the ziggurat, and
the ziggurat's 12:00 and we're 6:00.

3415
03:57:41,823 --> 03:57:45,274
SAM: We'll just say leeward and windward.
Starboard.

3416
03:57:45,274 --> 03:57:54,490
MATT: Okay, so. There is a singular figure
standing up here that seems to be giving orders

3417
03:57:54,490 --> 03:57:59,620
and shouting it out to the side. Female voice
rings out across the center of the chamber and

3418
03:57:59,620 --> 03:58:05,776
says, "Remnants, slay the intruders and grant
their bodies to the cause!"

3419
03:58:05,776 --> 03:58:08,316
LAURA: Can I see whose voice that was?

3420
03:58:08,316 --> 03:58:10,638
MATT: Make a perception check.

3421
03:58:10,638 --> 03:58:16,511
LAURA: That was crazy. 27.

3422
03:58:16,511 --> 03:58:23,094
MATT: 27. It's hard to see. She's in the dark
right there and the sphere doesn't give a lot of

3423
03:58:23,094 --> 03:58:25,454
light, but the voice sounds familiar.

3424
03:58:25,454 --> 03:58:29,471
SAM and LAURA: Familiar?

3425
03:58:29,471 --> 03:58:37,531
MATT: All right, so at this point the woman pulls
an amulet. The woman pulls an amulet out from

3426
03:58:37,531 --> 03:58:46,345
beneath the robe, and as she clutches it in her
hand, the orb shifts from black to white, to a

3427
03:58:46,345 --> 03:58:53,749
white-gray color, and you watch as the wind
(whoosh) gets whipped up even heavier and lights

3428
03:58:53,749 --> 03:59:02,083
up the area around the space. You watch as the
cloaked hood flows back, and for a brief moment,

3429
03:59:02,083 --> 03:59:07,991
before the grin crawls across her face, you see
the face of

3430
03:59:07,991 --> 03:59:09,515
Delilah Briarwood.

3431
03:59:09,515 --> 03:59:10,624
(gasps)

3432
03:59:10,624 --> 03:59:12,329
SAM: We killed her! She's dead!

3433
03:59:12,329 --> 03:59:13,781
LAURA: No!

3434
03:59:13,781 --> 03:59:15,424
TRAVIS: Look at Percy.

3435
03:59:15,424 --> 03:59:17,366
SAM: She's dead. She died. We killed her!

3436
03:59:17,366 --> 03:59:18,945
ASHLEY: Oh no.

3437
03:59:18,945 --> 03:59:20,770
MATT: Yet there she is at the top of the
ziggurat.

3438
03:59:20,770 --> 03:59:21,879
LAURA: How?!

3439
03:59:21,879 --> 03:59:23,498
SAM: This is like a soap opera!

3440
03:59:23,498 --> 03:59:25,589
LAURA: Dun dun dun!

3441
03:59:25,589 --> 03:59:28,053
TRAVIS: I broke the world for you returns!

3442
03:59:28,053 --> 03:59:30,095
MATT: I would like you all to roll initiative.

3443
03:59:30,095 --> 03:59:33,657
TRAVIS: (laughs) What?

3444
03:59:33,657 --> 03:59:35,862
LAURA: I know.

3445
03:59:35,862 --> 03:59:39,267
ASHLEY: This looks like a crazy fight.

3446
03:59:39,267 --> 03:59:43,167
MARISHA: Natural 20.

3447
03:59:43,167 --> 03:59:44,497
MATT: Nice.

3448
03:59:44,497 --> 03:59:49,655
MARISHA: If only it was for something a little
more important, but it's fine.

3449
03:59:49,655 --> 03:59:51,397
TALIESIN: You get to go first.

3450
03:59:51,397 --> 03:59:54,248
MATT: So 25 to 20?

3451
03:59:54,248 --> 03:59:55,891
TALIESIN: 20.

3452
03:59:55,891 --> 03:59:58,096
SAM: 20 for Scanlan.

3453
03:59:58,096 --> 03:59:59,316
MATT: What was it?

3454
03:59:59,316 --> 04:00:00,595
MARISHA: 22, tied with Scanlan.

3455
04:00:00,595 --> 04:00:02,803
SAM: No, mine's just 20.

3456
04:00:02,803 --> 04:00:04,374
MATT: All right, so Percy.

3457
04:00:04,374 --> 04:00:06,034
TALIESIN: Percy and Scanlan are tied.

3458
04:00:06,034 --> 04:00:09,805
MATT: Scanlan. Okay. All right.

3459
04:00:09,805 --> 04:00:16,192
SAM: Wait, does Doty roll? I forget. No, he just
goes when Taryon does.

3460
04:00:16,192 --> 04:00:19,641
MATT: Yeah, I'm letting him go with Taryon. It's
easier to check that. All right, 20 to 15?

3461
04:00:19,641 --> 04:00:21,115
TRAVIS: 17.

3462
04:00:21,115 --> 04:00:22,706
SAM: Taryon's 16.

3463
04:00:22,706 --> 04:00:23,668
LIAM: 15.

3464
04:00:23,668 --> 04:00:30,032
MATT: All right, so we have Grog. You got, what
did you say? 17? Vax, what did you say?

3465
04:00:30,032 --> 04:00:31,247
TRAVIS: 15.

3466
04:00:31,247 --> 04:00:32,941
MATT: Oh, 15 and you said 17 for Taryon?

3467
04:00:32,941 --> 04:00:34,507
SAM: 16 for Taryon.

3468
04:00:34,507 --> 04:00:35,640
MATT: All right.

3469
04:00:35,640 --> 04:00:38,981
LAURA: 14.

3470
04:00:38,981 --> 04:00:40,183
MATT: 14.

3471
04:00:40,183 --> 04:00:41,683
SAM: What did you get?

3472
04:00:41,683 --> 04:00:43,017
JON: 17.

3473
04:00:43,017 --> 04:00:44,155
SAM: He got 17. Did he tell you?

3474
04:00:44,155 --> 04:00:47,444
MATT: Oh, he didn't tell me that. Sorry about
that.

3475
04:00:47,444 --> 04:00:55,138
ASHLEY: Okay. So many things on the board. I
wonder if those statues

3476
04:00:55,138 --> 04:00:56,668
are going to come to life.

3477
04:00:56,668 --> 04:01:04,875
MATT: All righty. So who else is left. Pike?

3478
04:01:04,875 --> 04:01:10,505
ASHLEY: Seven! She's so good at initiative
rolling.

3479
04:01:10,505 --> 04:01:16,838
MATT: All right, so at the beginning of this
initiation, with the orb now flaring this pale

3480
04:01:16,838 --> 04:01:23,361
gray-white and Delilah Briarwood standing there at
the top of the ziggurat, staring down and focusing

3481
04:01:23,361 --> 04:01:26,111
on the group of intruders that have just rushed
in. Keyleth, it's your turn.

3482
04:01:26,111 --> 04:01:37,223
MARISHA: Oh god. Okay. I am going to, under the
cult hood that I have, transform my face with

3483
04:01:37,223 --> 04:01:39,846
Alter Self into Sylas Briarwood.

3484
04:01:39,846 --> 04:01:42,234
MATT: Okay.

3485
04:01:42,234 --> 04:01:50,570
MARISHA: Her husband. Her dead husband. I'm going
to have his face, and I'm going to walk forward

3486
04:01:50,570 --> 04:01:58,091
and say, Delilah. Don't. It is me.

3487
04:01:58,091 --> 04:02:03,044
MATT: Make a deception check.

3488
04:02:03,044 --> 04:02:06,485
MARISHA: Deception?

3489
04:02:06,485 --> 04:02:09,192
MATT: So as you step forward into the chamber.

3490
04:02:09,192 --> 04:02:13,644
MARISHA: This is not good.

3491
04:02:13,644 --> 04:02:16,394
LIAM: Sunshine, roll high.

3492
04:02:16,394 --> 04:02:30,650
MARISHA: I'm not good at this shit. Oh, that's not
bad! 14? That's it. 14. That's all I got. 14 is

3493
04:02:30,650 --> 04:02:32,001
good for me.

3494
04:02:32,001 --> 04:02:33,276
TALIESIN: It's dark.

3495
04:02:33,276 --> 04:02:39,123
MATT: Okay, so that's your action. As you say this
to Delilah, her eyes flash over to you,

3496
04:02:39,123 --> 04:02:43,986
and her face goes--

3497
04:02:43,986 --> 04:02:45,531
SAM: She's mad.

3498
04:02:45,531 --> 04:02:47,004
LAURA: So pissed!

3499
04:02:47,004 --> 04:02:49,616
MATT: You have your movement and your bonus,
still.

3500
04:02:49,616 --> 04:02:54,118
MARISHA: Movement and a bonus? (sighs)

3501
04:02:54,118 --> 04:02:57,197
LIAM: Feeblemind on the dragon.

3502
04:02:57,197 --> 04:03:10,303
MARISHA: I am going to take my bonus to ignite my
form into a fire elemental and rush towards the

3503
04:03:10,303 --> 04:03:12,008
closest thing to me.

3504
04:03:12,008 --> 04:03:13,901
MATT: Okay, there are two skeletons to your
right and left.

3505
04:03:13,901 --> 04:03:15,645
You're turning into a fire elemental.

3506
04:03:15,645 --> 04:03:22,761
MARISHA: Yeah. I don't know. Where are we?

3507
04:03:22,761 --> 04:03:26,730
MATT: There you go, Keyleth.

3508
04:03:26,730 --> 04:03:32,968
MARISHA: Okay, I have a 50-foot movement. I want
to hit as many skeletons as I can by running

3509
04:03:32,968 --> 04:03:35,276
through them and catching them on fire.

3510
04:03:35,276 --> 04:03:46,200
MATT: Okay, so with that, you can do (counting).
You can probably get this whole cluster here. All

3511
04:03:46,200 --> 04:03:53,097
righty. They all catch fire as you rush through.
You do get attacks of opportunity on you as you

3512
04:03:53,097 --> 04:03:58,091
rush by. That is 15?

3513
04:03:58,091 --> 04:04:05,763
MARISHA: What am I against?

3514
04:04:05,763 --> 04:04:09,263
MATT: What's your AC for your fire elemental?

3515
04:04:09,263 --> 04:04:10,441
MARISHA: Hit.

3516
04:04:10,441 --> 04:04:14,050
MATT: All right, so that's 11 points of slashing
damage, reduced to half because you take half

3517
04:04:14,050 --> 04:04:15,189
damage, right?

3518
04:04:15,189 --> 04:04:17,622
MARISHA: Yep. So five.

3519
04:04:17,622 --> 04:04:20,773
MATT: That's a 13?

3520
04:04:20,773 --> 04:04:25,013
MARISHA: Miss. No, hit. Armor class is 13.

3521
04:04:25,013 --> 04:04:30,033
MATT: Another five points of slashing damage.
Ten?

3522
04:04:30,033 --> 04:04:32,963
MARISHA: Miss.

3523
04:04:32,963 --> 04:04:34,945
MATT: Eight.

3524
04:04:34,945 --> 04:04:36,505
MARISHA: Miss.

3525
04:04:36,505 --> 04:04:52,026
MATT: Okay. That one and that one. That is a 15
from the minotaur skeleton.

3526
04:04:52,026 --> 04:04:53,390
MARISHA: Hit.

3527
04:04:53,390 --> 04:04:59,588
MATT: You take 17 points of slashing damage,
reduced to eight. And the last one is a natural

3528
04:04:59,588 --> 04:05:07,834
20, so you take 22 points of slashing damage,
reduced to 11. And they are all set aflame. All of

3529
04:05:07,834 --> 04:05:10,662
them take, I believe, fire damage from impacting
you?

3530
04:05:10,662 --> 04:05:12,251
MARISHA: Yep.

3531
04:05:12,251 --> 04:05:19,519
MATT: So we'll say eight damage across the board
for all of them. All of them get hit with fire as

3532
04:05:19,519 --> 04:05:24,297
they swipe out at you, including the giant
minotaur that swings over you with this large

3533
04:05:24,297 --> 04:05:29,756
greataxe in its hands and bursts into flames as it
does so. Awesome. All right, that ends your turn,

3534
04:05:29,756 --> 04:05:37,370
Keyleth. Delilah, who's currently glaring at
Keyleth and the rest of you, looks out and goes,

3535
04:05:37,370 --> 04:05:48,186
"Of course it would be you, wouldn't it?" She
takes a step back. Without breaking eye contact,

3536
04:05:48,186 --> 04:05:56,309
goes, "Finish your work." (foreign words) And
slams her hand down on the ground, and you watch

3537
04:05:56,309 --> 04:06:08,127
as this sphere of rainbow color completely
encompasses around the top of the ziggurat. You

3538
04:06:08,127 --> 04:06:15,302
now see this large orb, this dome of multicolored
rainbows that flickers for a second, and then

3539
04:06:15,302 --> 04:06:18,649
briefly becomes a singular color.

3540
04:06:18,649 --> 04:06:21,077
LAURA: It's a giant--

3541
04:06:21,077 --> 04:06:30,497
MATT: You see it is a giant Prismatic Sphere
around. The color you see now as it flickers for a

3542
04:06:30,497 --> 04:06:34,556
minute becomes stark red, just deep ruby red.

3543
04:06:34,556 --> 04:06:38,014
JON: It's so pretty. Look at it, you guys.

3544
04:06:38,014 --> 04:06:40,237
LIAM: Taste the rainbow.

3545
04:06:40,237 --> 04:06:42,338
TRAVIS: These people kill ducks, Lionel.

3546
04:06:42,338 --> 04:06:44,148
JON: (gasps) Kill them all!

3547
04:06:44,148 --> 04:06:46,983
MATT: Percival, Scanlan. What are you guys doing?

3548
04:06:46,983 --> 04:06:52,726
TALIESIN: Scanlan, you first. My plan just went up
the rainbow.

3549
04:06:52,726 --> 04:07:00,885
SAM: All right. I'll step forward and I will-- is
Vax or Vex near me? Vex is near me, right?

3550
04:07:00,885 --> 04:07:02,062
MATT: Vex is near you, yeah.

3551
04:07:02,062 --> 04:07:10,419
SAM: I will inspire Vex. I will sing to her. I
will sing, (singing) you don't need anybody else.

3552
04:07:10,419 --> 04:07:15,148
When I stand beside you, I touch you, elf. Whoa.

3553
04:07:15,148 --> 04:07:17,976
(laughter)

3554
04:07:17,976 --> 04:07:20,404
SAM: Something creepy.

3555
04:07:20,404 --> 04:07:21,889
LAURA: Working your way back up.

3556
04:07:21,889 --> 04:07:33,064
SAM: And then I'll cast Reverse Gravity on
everybody. Everybody in there. All their shit.

3557
04:07:33,064 --> 04:07:43,735
MATT: All righty! What's the radius on that? My
templates are still back on the shelf. Can someone

3558
04:07:43,735 --> 04:07:45,477
grab my templates real fast? That would be
awesome.

3559
04:07:45,477 --> 04:07:46,643
SAM: 50 feet.

3560
04:07:46,643 --> 04:07:47,736
MATT: 50-foot radius?

3561
04:07:47,736 --> 04:07:48,692
SAM: 50 feet radius.

3562
04:07:48,692 --> 04:07:52,734
MATT: Oh, that's going to get everybody in there,
including probably Keyleth.

3563
04:07:52,734 --> 04:07:55,563
MARISHA: I can take it. I'm into this.

3564
04:07:55,563 --> 04:07:56,863
MATT: You can fly, though, right?

3565
04:07:56,863 --> 04:07:59,451
MARISHA: I can fire hover?

3566
04:07:59,451 --> 04:08:02,850
TALIESIN: I have sticky feet right now, so I ain't
going nowhere.

3567
04:08:02,850 --> 04:08:08,419
MATT: Reverse Gravity, perfect. Dexterity save
across the board.

3568
04:08:08,419 --> 04:08:10,296
What's the spell DC with the hand cone?

3569
04:08:10,296 --> 04:08:11,653
SAM: 22.

3570
04:08:11,653 --> 04:08:13,395
TALIESIN: Fuck their shit up!

3571
04:08:13,395 --> 04:08:16,408
SAM: Does it affect people in the dome?

3572
04:08:16,408 --> 04:08:18,045
MATT: You don't know.

3573
04:08:18,045 --> 04:08:19,795
TALIESIN: We'll hear a thunk, won't we?

3574
04:08:19,795 --> 04:08:29,203
MATT: You see over here, a number of other robed
figures and one that looks like it's

3575
04:08:29,203 --> 04:08:36,487
heavily armored in the front, as well. A couple of
small other cultists down on the sides, but they

3576
04:08:36,487 --> 04:08:44,956
all-- apparently. Okay, the armored one actually
manages to grab the stonework and hold on.

3577
04:08:44,956 --> 04:08:51,899
SAM: Oh boy, Matt's hating this.

3578
04:08:51,899 --> 04:08:59,480
MATT: Everyone else, except for that one armored
guard, rises up and (wham) slams into the ceiling

3579
04:08:59,480 --> 04:09:08,257
50 feet up. That is 5d10 points of damage. 5d6,
sorry. Thank you very much. Perfect.

3580
04:09:08,257 --> 04:09:10,433
MARISHA: Is that including me, or no?

3581
04:09:10,433 --> 04:09:11,876
MATT: That would be including you.

3582
04:09:11,876 --> 04:09:12,925
MARISHA: Okay.

3583
04:09:12,925 --> 04:09:16,676
LIAM: Let me just reiterate, we always appreciated
Scanlan.

3584
04:09:16,676 --> 04:09:20,054
SAM: I just need to hear it more, guys.

3585
04:09:20,054 --> 04:09:29,184
MATT: 20 points of bludgeoning damage, which
completely destroys these skeletons that were

3586
04:09:29,184 --> 04:09:31,062
damaged earlier from the fire.

3587
04:09:31,062 --> 04:09:32,765
LIAM: So long, pawns.

3588
04:09:32,765 --> 04:09:37,379
MATT: All right. Are you maintaining it, or
letting them fall?

3589
04:09:37,379 --> 04:09:39,004
SAM: Maintain!

3590
04:09:39,004 --> 04:09:45,148
MATT: All righty, so everyone else is held in the
air right now against the ceiling.

3591
04:09:45,148 --> 04:09:47,451
SAM: The people inside the dome? No.

3592
04:09:47,451 --> 04:09:48,844
MATT: Seem to be unaffected.

3593
04:09:48,844 --> 04:09:50,344
SAM: Oh, that ziggurat.

3594
04:09:50,344 --> 04:09:51,843
LAURA: Anti-magic dome.

3595
04:09:51,843 --> 04:09:56,806
SAM: I'll move a little closer in.

3596
04:09:56,806 --> 04:10:00,194
MATT: So over here next to Pike?

3597
04:10:00,194 --> 04:10:02,775
SAM: Done. Percival.

3598
04:10:02,775 --> 04:10:05,927
MATT: That ends Scanlan's turn. Percy, what are
you doing?

3599
04:10:05,927 --> 04:10:11,928
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull out Bad News.
Actually, let's pull out Animus. This will be

3600
04:10:11,928 --> 04:10:16,226
funnier if I'm walking around that way, which is
always a fun thing to say. There's that one guy

3601
04:10:16,226 --> 04:10:17,644
holding on, right?

3602
04:10:17,644 --> 04:10:19,591
MATT: There's one guy holding on, yeah.

3603
04:10:19,591 --> 04:10:22,519
TALIESIN: There's one guy holding on. I'm going to
use my gun to make him drop an object of my

3604
04:10:22,519 --> 04:10:31,131
choosing. And that object is going to be the
pyramid. So just remembering how to do this.

3605
04:10:31,131 --> 04:10:34,090
MATT: Roll for an attack.

3606
04:10:34,090 --> 04:10:39,155
TALIESIN: Roll for an attack. That's 29?

3607
04:10:39,155 --> 04:10:41,814
MATT: That will hit. All right, he has to make a
strength saving throw?

3608
04:10:41,814 --> 04:10:43,726
TALIESIN: Strength saving throw against 20.

3609
04:10:43,726 --> 04:10:50,503
MATT: Nope, five plus five. That is a no, so he
goes (whoosh) and slams into the ceiling, as well,

3610
04:10:50,503 --> 04:10:56,932
taking-- ooh, that is 22 points of bludgeoning
damage.

3611
04:10:56,932 --> 04:11:00,515
MARISHA: Can Keyleth clothesline him on the way up
as a fire elemental?

3612
04:11:00,515 --> 04:11:10,263
MATT: Sure. Close enough. You swoosh over there;
it's fine. More of a flavor element. So all the

3613
04:11:10,263 --> 04:11:13,842
visible creatures you can see right now are held
against the ceiling.

3614
04:11:13,842 --> 04:11:19,426
TALIESIN: Okay, is he still alive? I don't suppose
I have advantage to hit anything that's pinned to

3615
04:11:19,426 --> 04:11:21,347
the ceiling.

3616
04:11:21,347 --> 04:11:25,823
MATT: I'm going to say for the purposes of falling
up, a lot of them are prone, so you would actually

3617
04:11:25,823 --> 04:11:27,331
have disadvantage.

3618
04:11:27,331 --> 04:11:43,983
TALIESIN: So weird. I'll take it. I hit the wrong
thing. There we are. I'll burn another point for

3619
04:11:43,983 --> 04:11:56,854
advantage and shoot him again. Just with a
straight roll. That's 19.

3620
04:11:56,854 --> 04:12:02,715
MATT: That hits. Same armored guy?

3621
04:12:02,715 --> 04:12:12,775
TALIESIN: Same guy. That's nine points of damage,
plus three points of psychic damage.

3622
04:12:12,775 --> 04:12:19,675
MATT: Okay. All right?

3623
04:12:19,675 --> 04:12:28,790
TALIESIN: And I'll hit him again. Same thing. Hit
him again. This time I'm going to take a bonus for

3624
04:12:28,790 --> 04:12:35,983
a Hex on him, too, for extra fun. That's 27.

3625
04:12:35,983 --> 04:12:37,906
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

3626
04:12:37,906 --> 04:12:48,219
TALIESIN: So that's not bad. That's 17 points of
damage, plus three points of psychic damage and

3627
04:12:48,219 --> 04:12:50,059
five points of necrotic damage.

3628
04:12:50,059 --> 04:12:55,696
MATT: Nice! You're just firing up at this figure.
The one shot sends it flying up into the ceiling,

3629
04:12:55,696 --> 04:13:00,962
and I'd say even before it impacts, as it's still
floating up in the air, you shoot it once while

3630
04:13:00,962 --> 04:13:05,340
it's still falling upward, and then it slams into
the ceiling and you get one final shot to hit it

3631
04:13:05,340 --> 04:13:10,145
while it's there. (grunts) Across the top. It's
hard to see if it's really that hurt, but it's

3632
04:13:10,145 --> 04:13:13,287
currently a little wounded.

3633
04:13:13,287 --> 04:13:18,773
TALIESIN: Yeah, and he's got disadvantage on
dexterity checks for now, because that's funny.

3634
04:13:18,773 --> 04:13:21,671
MATT: Are you going to move, Percival, or are you
going to stay where you are?

3635
04:13:21,671 --> 04:13:25,422
TALIESIN: I'm slowly going to make my way towards
the ziggurat, so I'm going to be actually walking

3636
04:13:25,422 --> 04:13:31,470
up on the wall. So you can put me up on the little
creases. Yeah, I'm walking sideways, as gravity's

3637
04:13:31,470 --> 04:13:37,668
reversed right now. I'll make my way, as far as I
can get, towards the sphere.

3638
04:13:37,668 --> 04:13:42,829
MATT: Okay, and that radius, by the way, is
maintained as long as you concentrate on that. So

3639
04:13:42,829 --> 04:13:49,185
anybody who walks into that radius will have to
make a dex save or be flung up into that. So! That

3640
04:13:49,185 --> 04:13:55,285
being the case, ending Scanlan's turn and Percy's
turn, the cultists that are currently flung to the

3641
04:13:55,285 --> 04:14:01,494
ceiling are going to get up and run this way, so
they're technically up on the ceiling right now.

3642
04:14:01,494 --> 04:14:12,121
Those two are going to continue their work. You
don't see what's in there. Grog, you're up.

3643
04:14:12,121 --> 04:14:14,491
TRAVIS: Is it me and Chad?

3644
04:14:14,491 --> 04:14:23,476
MATT: Let's see here. Actually, no. I disagree.
They actually can take an action this turn from

3645
04:14:23,476 --> 04:14:31,995
that distance. So I need Grog and Pike to both
make wisdom saving throws.

3646
04:14:31,995 --> 04:14:36,327
LAURA: Are you both wise?

3647
04:14:36,327 --> 04:14:42,100
ASHLEY: I have gnome cunning, so I have advantage
on wisdom.

3648
04:14:42,100 --> 04:14:43,565
TRAVIS: 14.

3649
04:14:43,565 --> 04:14:45,101
MATT: 14.

3650
04:14:45,101 --> 04:14:47,528
ASHLEY: What did you say it was, wisdom? 20?

3651
04:14:47,528 --> 04:14:49,915
LAURA: Roll your advantage. You get advantage.

3652
04:14:49,915 --> 04:14:51,555
ASHLEY: Maybe I don't need it?

3653
04:14:51,555 --> 04:14:53,974
LAURA: Try it. Maybe you'll roll a natural 20.

3654
04:14:53,974 --> 04:14:56,359
MATT: Advantage for which one?

3655
04:14:56,359 --> 04:15:02,711
ASHLEY: I have gnome cunning. I have advantage on
wisdom, intelligence, charisma saving throws.

3656
04:15:02,711 --> 04:15:04,810
MATT: Just in general?

3657
04:15:04,810 --> 04:15:06,758
ASHLEY: I guess so.

3658
04:15:06,758 --> 04:15:18,248
MATT: Against magic, I think it was? So yeah, both
of you guys shrug off the effect. You feel the

3659
04:15:18,248 --> 04:15:24,934
magic try to take hold over the inside of your
brain and your muscles seize up and you manage to

3660
04:15:24,934 --> 04:15:31,163
shrug it off. It's a familiar feeling. It is one
that you're familiar with, as well, Pike. It is a

3661
04:15:31,163 --> 04:15:33,144
Hold Person attempt on both of you.

3662
04:15:33,144 --> 04:15:35,978
ASHLEY: I know what you did. I know what you were
trying to do!

3663
04:15:35,978 --> 04:15:40,781
MATT: All right, that ends their turn. Grog,
you're up.

3664
04:15:40,781 --> 04:15:44,191
TRAVIS: Okay, where does that sphere of vertical
influence start?

3665
04:15:44,191 --> 04:15:45,678
MATT: You're not entirely certain, Grog.

3666
04:15:45,678 --> 04:15:51,463
TRAVIS: Awesome. I'm going to go into a rage and
haul ass along this wall.

3667
04:15:51,463 --> 04:15:56,278
MATT: Okay, as you rush into this wall here, I
need you to make a dexterity saving throw.

3668
04:15:56,278 --> 04:16:02,840
TRAVIS: I have advantage on those. 14.

3669
04:16:02,840 --> 04:16:09,373
MATT: Grog, you start running and then (yelps) go
flying up into the ceiling.

3670
04:16:09,373 --> 04:16:12,966
SAM: Oh shit, it affects the area?

3671
04:16:12,966 --> 04:16:17,935
TRAVIS: (screams)

3672
04:16:17,935 --> 04:16:21,229
MATT: You take 17 points of bludgeoning.

3673
04:16:21,229 --> 04:16:23,547
TRAVIS: I raged at the beginning.

3674
04:16:23,547 --> 04:16:30,050
MATT: So half that. You're now locked on the
ceiling, as well. However, that does put you in

3675
04:16:30,050 --> 04:16:34,349
melee range, and prone, with one of the cultists
on the ceiling.

3676
04:16:34,349 --> 04:16:37,085
TRAVIS: Totally meant to do that. I'll attack.

3677
04:16:37,085 --> 04:16:40,602
MATT: You're upside-down on the ceiling. The guy
who cast a spell and it didn't work on you watched

3678
04:16:40,602 --> 04:16:43,373
you tumble up, land, get up, and stare him down in
his face.

3679
04:16:43,373 --> 04:16:44,519
TRAVIS: Hi.

3680
04:16:44,519 --> 04:16:49,164
MATT: His hood falls off. You see a guy who's
staring at you now with

3681
04:16:49,164 --> 04:16:51,138
one eye plucked out of its socket.

3682
04:16:51,138 --> 04:16:56,719
TRAVIS: Might as well make a matching one.
Reckless! Natural 20.

3683
04:16:56,719 --> 04:16:58,514
(cheering)

3684
04:16:58,514 --> 04:17:00,070
MATT: Roll some damage.

3685
04:17:00,070 --> 04:17:21,189
TRAVIS: So I rolled a ten. Two more of these,
seven. 31, 11, 42.

3686
04:17:21,189 --> 04:17:33,613
MATT: Okay. You smile at him, bring the axe back,
and you completely-- we're talking tree trunk. He

3687
04:17:33,613 --> 04:17:38,632
slides over and his body attaches to the ceiling
and collapses against that, blood splattering out

3688
04:17:38,632 --> 04:17:46,064
from his midsection. It seems really gross, in a
sense. You still have at half movement, about 20

3689
04:17:46,064 --> 04:17:47,927
feet to run across.

3690
04:17:47,927 --> 04:17:50,164
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll keep trying to come to this wall.

3691
04:17:50,164 --> 04:17:58,203
MATT: This wall? Okay. That's about as far as you
get, but you don't have range with your axe.

3692
04:17:58,282 --> 04:17:59,724
TRAVIS: That's my turn.

3693
04:17:59,724 --> 04:18:05,689
MATT: Okay. Finishes Grog's turn. Lionel. You're
over here, currently.

3694
04:18:05,689 --> 04:18:15,416
JON: I move forward and I jump into the radius so
I can float up, too. And as I'm flying, I say,

3695
04:18:15,416 --> 04:18:17,036
I'll save you, Grog!

3696
04:18:17,036 --> 04:18:21,321
TRAVIS: Come on, buddy!

3697
04:18:21,321 --> 04:18:28,062
MATT: Do you go into a rage first? It will reduce
your impact damage as you land.

3698
04:18:28,062 --> 04:18:31,236
JON: Wait, what?

3699
04:18:31,236 --> 04:18:32,704
TALIESIN: You take less damage.

3700
04:18:32,704 --> 04:18:34,531
MATT: If you want to be raging first, you'll take
less damage from the impact.

3701
04:18:34,531 --> 04:18:36,129
JON: Yeah, you know what? Let's rage.

3702
04:18:36,129 --> 04:18:39,593
MATT: Okay. You joyfully leap into the sky.

3703
04:18:39,593 --> 04:18:40,995
JON: It's the duck rage.

3704
04:18:40,995 --> 04:18:46,130
MATT: You take 16, reduced to half, so you take
eight points of bludgeoning damage as you slam

3705
04:18:46,130 --> 04:18:52,109
into the ground at the top, and you stand up and
there's about five feet between you and Grog, and

3706
04:18:52,109 --> 04:18:55,575
one of the cultists is there right in front of
you, who's like, "Shit!"

3707
04:18:55,575 --> 04:18:58,690
JON: I rage.

3708
04:18:58,690 --> 04:19:03,477
MATT: Do you want to attack him? Go for it.

3709
04:19:03,477 --> 04:19:14,137
JON: I think the anti-gravity is screwing me up.
Three, plus 12.

3710
04:19:14,137 --> 04:19:16,915
MATT: Three plus 12 still hits, actually.

3711
04:19:16,915 --> 04:19:19,130
JON: He does it clumsily.

3712
04:19:19,130 --> 04:19:23,115
MATT: Your first strike is 2d6 plus ten damage.

3713
04:19:23,115 --> 04:19:31,791
JON: Seven. 17.

3714
04:19:31,791 --> 04:19:36,272
MATT: 17 points of slashing damage as you pull
your greataxe up and rake past. You see his chest

3715
04:19:36,272 --> 04:19:42,386
split open and he (grunts) pulls back. He's still
alive, and as he looks up at you from under the hood, he is

3716
04:19:42,386 --> 04:19:44,907
also missing one of his eyes. (pants)

3717
04:19:44,907 --> 04:19:50,071
JON: Second attack? Rage, bonus action...

3718
04:19:50,071 --> 04:19:55,433
MATT: You have an extra attack as a barbarian, so
you get a second attack.

3719
04:19:55,433 --> 04:19:56,794
JON: Okay.

3720
04:19:56,794 --> 04:19:58,495
TALIESIN: d20.

3721
04:19:58,495 --> 04:20:00,500
JON: Do the same thing.

3722
04:20:00,500 --> 04:20:05,684
TALIESIN: Natural 20! Now roll 4d6.

3723
04:20:05,684 --> 04:20:06,855
MATT: Roll 4d6.

3724
04:20:06,855 --> 04:20:07,901
TRAVIS: Stop touching him!

3725
04:20:07,901 --> 04:20:15,688
TALIESIN: He's so plush, though. It's really nice.
Whoa! Does he get to reroll ones?

3726
04:20:15,688 --> 04:20:17,995
SAM: Oh, that's a one.

3727
04:20:17,995 --> 04:20:19,460
TALIESIN: Does he get to reroll a one?

3728
04:20:19,460 --> 04:20:22,601
MATT: He does, because of his great weapon
fighting, yeah.

3729
04:20:22,601 --> 04:20:24,207
TALIESIN: Reroll it. Better.

3730
04:20:24,207 --> 04:20:30,549
JON: So it's 17. Plus ten. 27.

3731
04:20:30,549 --> 04:20:36,467
MATT: Okay. The first strike cuts him across the
chest. (pants) Rears back. Oh, that wasn't enough,

3732
04:20:36,467 --> 04:20:46,785
and with a second half-assed swipe, he goes down
and spills out all across the ceiling. That

3733
04:20:46,785 --> 04:20:53,447
cultist is done. All righty, that finishes your
turn. Taryon.

3734
04:20:53,447 --> 04:21:00,200
SAM: Doty, stay here. I'll jump on the broom. I
cast Fly on-- no, I don't have to cast Fly.

3735
04:21:00,200 --> 04:21:01,253
I'm on a broom!

3736
04:21:01,253 --> 04:21:04,879
LAURA: It's hard to keep track of three
characters.

3737
04:21:04,879 --> 04:21:08,129
SAM: Well, Matt does it all the time.

3738
04:21:08,129 --> 04:21:14,450
TALIESIN: The walls are tall enough that you can
put that above people and it won't be a problem.

3739
04:21:14,450 --> 04:21:17,161
MATT: Possibly. We'll find out. Where are you
going, Tary?

3740
04:21:17,161 --> 04:21:20,944
SAM: I'm going to fly straight in to the steps.

3741
04:21:20,944 --> 04:21:24,610
MATT: All right, so you're doing a dash? Or just
your movement?

3742
04:21:24,610 --> 04:21:27,994
SAM: Can I get there in one fly?

3743
04:21:27,994 --> 04:21:29,583
MATT: What's the speed of the broom?

3744
04:21:29,583 --> 04:21:31,049
SAM: It's 40, right?

3745
04:21:31,049 --> 04:21:33,820
MATT: You can get there. That's as close as you
can get with one movement.

3746
04:21:33,820 --> 04:21:37,084
TALIESIN: You're close, though. You can throw
something at it.

3747
04:21:37,084 --> 04:21:51,507
SAM: I can't get all the way there, so I'll cast
something. Shit. It's a prismatic thing, right?

3748
04:21:51,507 --> 04:21:58,936
MATT: Right now you have this ruby, bright-red
dome that's glowing with light right now.

3749
04:21:58,936 --> 04:22:04,410
SAM: Would a Prismatic Spray beat a Prismatic
Spray? Probably not, right?

3750
04:22:04,410 --> 04:22:06,380
MATT: I don't know. What do you think?

3751
04:22:06,380 --> 04:22:11,595
SAM: Shit. I'm not going to risk it. I'm going to
point straight up.

3752
04:22:11,595 --> 04:22:15,543
Is there anyone right above me?

3753
04:22:15,543 --> 04:22:19,950
MATT: Yes, actually. These guys here are 
on the ceiling right now. Anything you see there

3754
04:22:19,950 --> 04:22:22,549
are on the ceiling, currently.

3755
04:22:22,549 --> 04:22:33,232
SAM: And I'm up a bit, so I could throw something
at them? I guess drop it. I'll drop a thing

3756
04:22:33,232 --> 04:22:39,277
of fire up there. Alchemic fire. A little pot.

3757
04:22:39,277 --> 04:22:40,897
MATT: At which one?

3758
04:22:40,897 --> 04:22:44,717
SAM: Can I get two of them? It has a five-foot
radius.

3759
04:22:44,717 --> 04:22:46,412
MATT: Yes, you can hit these two.

3760
04:22:46,412 --> 04:22:47,903
SAM: Great. I'll go for both of them.

3761
04:22:47,903 --> 04:22:55,979
MATT: All right, so the skeleton and guy get to make...
what's the DC?

3762
04:22:55,979 --> 04:22:57,309
SAM: 17.

3763
04:22:57,309 --> 04:23:03,754
MATT: 17? Unfortunately, the cultist makes it.
Skeleton does not. So the cultist dodges out of

3764
04:23:03,754 --> 04:23:08,171
the way on the ceiling. It smashes on the ground
by the skeleton and bursts into flames. How much

3765
04:23:08,171 --> 04:23:09,920
damage does it deal to the skeleton?

3766
04:23:09,920 --> 04:23:12,776
SAM: I'm 15th level or 16th level?

3767
04:23:12,831 --> 04:23:13,723
MATT: 15th.

3768
04:23:13,723 --> 04:23:15,240
SAM: Okay. 5d6.

3769
04:23:15,240 --> 04:23:17,076
MATT: 5d6 fire damage to the skeleton.

3770
04:23:17,076 --> 04:23:23,201
SAM: 16.

3771
04:23:23,201 --> 04:23:28,643
MATT: 16 points of fire damage? That skeleton,
fire consumes it. It's still currently standing,

3772
04:23:28,643 --> 04:23:31,902
and now the flames are licking through its
ribcage. That ends your turn?

3773
04:23:31,902 --> 04:23:39,038
SAM: I will, as a bonus action, cast Sanctuary. Am
I within 30 feet of any of my friends?

3774
04:23:39,038 --> 04:23:43,373
MATT: Right now? Nope.

3775
04:23:43,373 --> 04:23:44,737
SAM: On myself.

3776
04:23:44,737 --> 04:23:46,755
MATT: All righty. Vax, you're up.

3777
04:23:46,755 --> 04:23:57,149
LIAM: Boots on, poof go the wings. I have two
actions left. It's really hard to see. How far am

3778
04:23:57,149 --> 04:23:59,594
I from skeletal minotaur?

3779
04:23:59,594 --> 04:24:03,059
MATT: Right there? You're approximately 40 feet.
45.

3780
04:24:03,059 --> 04:24:10,256
LIAM: And nowhere on the board are any of my
allies within melee combat range of any enemy.

3781
04:24:10,256 --> 04:24:12,868
MATT: Nope! Anyone that was killed whatever they
were fighting.

3782
04:24:12,868 --> 04:24:19,430
LIAM: That's what I figured. Okay, so I'm going to
use my two remaining actions to throw daggers at

3783
04:24:19,430 --> 04:24:21,294
minotaur skeleton.

3784
04:24:21,294 --> 04:24:25,099
MATT: From where you are? From where you're
standing?

3785
04:24:25,099 --> 04:24:27,994
LIAM: I'm 40 feet away. I'm in range.

3786
04:24:27,994 --> 04:24:29,979
MATT: Yeah, and you have sharpshooter.

3787
04:24:29,979 --> 04:24:32,320
LIAM: I didn't say it on the first.

3788
04:24:32,320 --> 04:24:35,872
MATT: You have sharpshooter, right? Sharpshooter feat.

3789
04:24:35,872 --> 04:24:38,765
LIAM: I have it if I choose it, but I don't want
to choose it.

3790
04:24:38,765 --> 04:24:41,210
MATT: Right, I'm asking because that ignores
cover.

3791
04:24:41,210 --> 04:24:44,501
LIAM: I have sharpshooter. Right, so I ignore
three-quarters cover. So the first one is a 19?

3792
04:24:44,501 --> 04:24:45,531
MATT: Hits.

3793
04:24:45,531 --> 04:24:55,377
LIAM: Good, and the second one-- oh, that hits,
for sure. That's a 16... 28. Okay, so for the

3794
04:24:55,377 --> 04:25:02,467
first one, I'm going to unload some Smite into
this motherfucker because I know he's undead. That

3795
04:25:02,467 --> 04:25:13,959
is three, plus eight is 11, plus psychic damage is
17, plus 3d8 because he's undead. So 17 plus eight

3796
04:25:13,959 --> 04:25:20,820
is 25, 29, 36 for the first attack.

3797
04:25:20,820 --> 04:25:26,868
MATT: 36 damage. As you fling the dagger out, it
seems to skid across the stone of the pillar in

3798
04:25:26,868 --> 04:25:30,987
front of it, leaving these bright white sparks as
it hits. Comes through and strikes through the

3799
04:25:30,987 --> 04:25:35,299
chest. As it does, a burst of divine energy. You
watch as some of the ribs shatter and scatter

3800
04:25:35,299 --> 04:25:40,312
across the stonework. (roars)

3801
04:25:40,312 --> 04:25:49,919
LIAM: Fucking feathers, buddy. And then the second
one is four, plus the Smite, and I get four plus

3802
04:25:49,919 --> 04:25:54,937
eight is 12, 15, 22.

3803
04:25:54,937 --> 04:25:56,482
MATT: 22.

3804
04:25:56,482 --> 04:25:59,151
LIAM: Wait, I can only smite once per round?

3805
04:25:59,151 --> 04:26:05,624
MATT: You can smite. I believe so. I think it's
whenever you expend a spell slot, so I don't think

3806
04:26:05,624 --> 04:26:10,103
there's a limitation per round. That's part of
what makes paladins so crazy at the higher levels,

3807
04:26:10,103 --> 04:26:16,943
actually. But just to make sure of that or the
internet's going to hate me. No, there's no

3808
04:26:16,943 --> 04:26:19,436
limitation on that. So 22?

3809
04:26:19,436 --> 04:26:27,114
LIAM: I'm also going to use my movement. Is there
enough room to fly safely over big skeleton?

3810
04:26:27,114 --> 04:26:33,007
MATT: Yeah, it's about 12 feet tall, so as long as
you get 20 feet over it, you can.

3811
04:26:33,007 --> 04:26:40,872
LIAM: Then I want to get into the back corner
closest to Liam, on the map.

3812
04:26:40,872 --> 04:26:42,315
MATT: Over here?

3813
04:26:42,315 --> 04:26:44,182
LIAM: Yeah. 120 feet of movement.

3814
04:26:44,182 --> 04:26:45,820
MATT: Over here, you mean.

3815
04:26:45,820 --> 04:26:46,863
LIAM: Yeah.

3816
04:26:46,863 --> 04:26:50,821
MATT: All right, you're over here in this area.

3817
04:26:50,821 --> 04:26:55,623
LIAM: As far back from the enemies as I can be.
That's good. Done.

3818
04:26:55,623 --> 04:26:58,222
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Vex.

3819
04:26:58,222 --> 04:27:01,605
LAURA: Has anybody tried shooting anything through
the orb?

3820
04:27:01,684 --> 04:27:02,948
MATT: Not yet, no.

3821
04:27:02,948 --> 04:27:08,150
LAURA: Okay. Well, I'm going to try Hunter's
Marking Delilah.

3822
04:27:08,150 --> 04:27:09,887
MATT: You have no sight on her.

3823
04:27:09,887 --> 04:27:11,188
LAURA: I don't?

3824
04:27:11,188 --> 04:27:18,666
MATT: No. All you see is a sphere of red. It
blocks everything. All sight is obscured with

3825
04:27:18,666 --> 04:27:23,322
light. It's very bright; the whole room is lit up.
You almost have to squint a little,

3826
04:27:23,322 --> 04:27:24,846
looking at it.

3827
04:27:24,846 --> 04:27:29,218
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to try to shoot an arrow,
then, at where I remember her being.

3828
04:27:29,218 --> 04:27:31,536
MATT: Okay, go for it. Roll an attack.

3829
04:27:31,536 --> 04:27:37,464
LAURA: Because it's red. Natural 20!

3830
04:27:37,464 --> 04:27:40,690
MATT: Awesome. The arrow shatters. No effect.

3831
04:27:40,690 --> 04:27:50,824
LAURA: Oh, what a waste. Because it was red.
Motherfuck. Okay, then I'm going to Hunter's Mark

3832
04:27:50,824 --> 04:27:59,650
that big guy and I'm going to shoot him with a
flaming bowstring.

3833
04:27:59,650 --> 04:28:03,019
LIAM: Y'all motherfuckers need Sarenrae.

3834
04:28:03,019 --> 04:28:05,511
LAURA: Are you fucking kidding me?

3835
04:28:05,511 --> 04:28:08,168
LIAM: Well, you got a 20 on the last one.

3836
04:28:08,168 --> 04:28:10,055
LAURA: Yeah, when it didn't fucking count!

3837
04:28:10,055 --> 04:28:15,091
LIAM: Well, we've all got to eat a little humble
pie every once in a while. Even you.

3838
04:28:15,091 --> 04:28:19,401
LAURA: You motherfuck. Don't rub it in my face
when I just rolled a one.

3839
04:28:19,401 --> 04:28:22,339
MATT: Anything you want to do with Trinket?
Movement?

3840
04:28:22,339 --> 04:28:29,439
LAURA: No, he has to wait because he's going to
get hit. He's going to get bludgeoned.

3841
04:28:29,439 --> 04:28:34,052
MATT: Okay, ends Vex's turn. Skeletons are now
going to go.

3842
04:28:34,052 --> 04:28:37,527
LAURA: I am going to move back into the little
corner that's next to me.

3843
04:28:37,527 --> 04:28:38,978
MATT: Right here.

3844
04:28:38,978 --> 04:28:41,229
LAURA: Yeah, and Trinket will follow me in there.

3845
04:28:41,229 --> 04:28:50,827
MATT: Perfect. The skeletons get up and start
rushing in towards the nearest things. This one's

3846
04:28:50,827 --> 04:28:54,369
going to rush towards Grog. This one's going to
rush towards Keyleth there. This one's also going

3847
04:28:54,369 --> 04:29:00,872
to rush towards Keyleth. The minotaur, who got
impacted angrily, sees you dart past. Turns

3848
04:29:00,872 --> 04:29:11,044
around. You're not within range, so it's going to
move up towards (heavy footsteps). This knight is

3849
04:29:11,044 --> 04:29:16,801
also going to move in towards Keyleth. These guys
up at the top are going to focus in that

3850
04:29:16,801 --> 04:29:25,950
way. All right, first, the minotaur swings with
its axe. Makes a giant swing towards you, Lionel.

3851
04:29:25,950 --> 04:29:35,648
Actually, no. What it's going to do is it's going
to rush up, instead, put its head down, and charge

3852
04:29:35,648 --> 04:29:48,172
forward towards you with its horns in front. It's
attempting to strike you with its horns. That's 18 to

3853
04:29:48,172 --> 04:29:50,737
hit. What's your armor class?

3854
04:29:50,737 --> 04:29:52,202
JON: It is 18.

3855
04:29:52,202 --> 04:30:02,572
MATT: 18, okay, so that just barely hits. You
suffer 13 plus nine. You take 21 points of

3856
04:30:02,572 --> 04:30:07,564
piercing damage, reduced to half, so it's ten,
because you're raging. I need you to make a

3857
04:30:07,564 --> 04:30:09,528
strength saving throw.

3858
04:30:09,528 --> 04:30:16,945
JON: So mine's plus ten. That's with this dice,
right?

3859
04:30:16,945 --> 04:30:20,747
MATT: Yes. Roll that, plus ten.

3860
04:30:20,747 --> 04:30:22,946
JON: 23.

3861
04:30:22,946 --> 04:30:27,671
MATT: 23, yeah. You're not pushed. You get the
impact and the horns come to your chest and you're

3862
04:30:27,671 --> 04:30:31,903
like, "ooh, that hurt," but this giant creature's
stopped in its tracks. Its hooves are scraping

3863
04:30:31,903 --> 04:30:39,430
into the ground, and you're immovable. That's the
end of its turn. Skeleton attacks on Keyleth.

3864
04:30:39,430 --> 04:30:42,346
That's 18?

3865
04:30:42,346 --> 04:30:43,689
MARISHA: Hits.

3866
04:30:43,689 --> 04:30:44,970
MATT: 13?

3867
04:30:44,970 --> 04:30:47,754
MARISHA: Hits. 13 is my armor class.

3868
04:30:47,754 --> 04:30:53,528
MATT: All right, you take 22 points of slashing
damage, reduced to 11, from the two attacks.

3869
04:30:53,528 --> 04:30:56,742
MARISHA: 11, so I'm at 52.

3870
04:30:56,742 --> 04:31:01,689
MATT: And all right.

3871
04:31:01,689 --> 04:31:07,446
TALIESIN: Dungeons and Dragons. Yeah.

3872
04:31:07,446 --> 04:31:14,895
MATT: The blackguard is going to make three
attacks with this giant glaive that it has. Now

3873
04:31:14,895 --> 04:31:20,405
you've got up close, you can see this jagged black
armor. He's going to rush up with his glaive and

3874
04:31:20,405 --> 04:31:45,180
spins. All three attacks on you. That is 23? 18?
And 16. All righty, so you take nine, plus

3875
04:31:45,180 --> 04:31:56,164
Thunderous Smite damage. That's going to be 21
points of damage. Sorry, it's going to be nine

3876
04:31:56,164 --> 04:32:01,363
points of slashing, which is reduced to four, and
then you take an additional

3877
04:32:01,363 --> 04:32:05,893
15 points of thunder damage.

3878
04:32:05,893 --> 04:32:08,121
MARISHA: So 19 points total?

3879
04:32:08,121 --> 04:32:09,953
MATT: Correct. Mark that off.

3880
04:32:09,953 --> 04:32:14,886
TALIESIN: No, it's the big motherfucker. The
minotaur.

3881
04:32:14,886 --> 04:32:17,351
LIAM: Wait, smite?

3882
04:32:17,351 --> 04:32:27,675
MATT: The second strike is going to hit you again.
He's going to burn another slot for another smite.

3883
04:32:27,675 --> 04:32:38,548
On the second one, you take another four points of
slashing damage, plus 13 points of radiant damage

3884
04:32:38,548 --> 04:32:41,996
to you. This would be necrotic damage.

3885
04:32:41,996 --> 04:32:43,994
TRAVIS: From the skeleton minotaur?

3886
04:32:43,994 --> 04:32:45,583
MATT: No, this is from the armored guy.

3887
04:32:45,583 --> 04:32:50,779
TRAVIS: Gotcha. Okay. We've got to get you out of
there.

3888
04:32:50,779 --> 04:33:00,110
MATT: And the third strike hits you for four
points of slashing and a third dark smite. Another

3889
04:33:00,110 --> 04:33:01,941
13 points of necrotic damage.

3890
04:33:01,941 --> 04:33:05,354
MARISHA: That brings me exactly to zero.

3891
04:33:05,354 --> 04:33:07,398
MATT: You drop your form.

3892
04:33:07,398 --> 04:33:16,233
MARISHA: I drop form. Just form. I tanked that
motherfucking fight, y'all.

3893
04:33:16,233 --> 04:33:21,316
MATT: So at that point, all of a sudden your form
drops in place.

3894
04:33:21,316 --> 04:33:24,309
MARISHA: I'm still on the ceiling, right?

3895
04:33:24,309 --> 04:33:35,412
MATT: Yes, you are. The war priest across the way
is going to look outward and begin to focus and

3896
04:33:35,412 --> 04:33:40,544
chant under his breath, and the little bit of
light begins to show, once again, the missing eye

3897
04:33:40,544 --> 04:33:44,950
on most of these individuals. Delilah is not
missing an eye, it seems, but the rest of them

3898
04:33:44,950 --> 04:33:50,742
seem to have this appearance amongst them. As it
releases this form of energy, you watch as a

3899
04:33:50,742 --> 04:33:58,359
familiar, darker-burning flame begins to spill
across the ceiling as a Flame Strike makes its

3900
04:33:58,359 --> 04:34:04,527
way-- not a Fire Storm, Flame Strike. Sorry, so
it's a column.

3901
04:34:04,527 --> 04:34:08,773
SAM: Am I close to him?

3902
04:34:08,773 --> 04:34:14,128
MATT: Scanlan is-- it's a 60-foot range, is what
you're asking? Yes, it is.

3903
04:34:14,128 --> 04:34:15,862
SAM: I'll Counterspell that.

3904
04:34:15,862 --> 04:34:17,120
MATT: Counterspell the Flame Strike?

3905
04:34:17,120 --> 04:34:18,479
SAM: Sure.

3906
04:34:18,479 --> 04:34:20,627
MARISHA: Scanlan!

3907
04:34:20,627 --> 04:34:22,931
LIAM: I missed you.

3908
04:34:22,931 --> 04:34:25,203
TALIESIN: It's so nice that this is not a problem.

3909
04:34:25,203 --> 04:34:28,514
MATT: I need you to roll a d20. Add your charisma
modifier.

3910
04:34:28,514 --> 04:34:41,681
SAM: It's just a plus two? Oh, wait. Wrong guy!
Ooh, 19.

3911
04:34:41,681 --> 04:34:49,997
MATT: 19 will do it. With that, as the flames
begin to well out in this column of fire and dark

3912
04:34:49,997 --> 04:34:58,227
divine energy, you just reach out and snap your
fingers and the spell vanishes on the spot.

3913
04:34:58,227 --> 04:35:00,045
LIAM: Shorthalt.

3914
04:35:00,045 --> 04:35:01,277
ASHLEY: Shorthalt.

3915
04:35:01,277 --> 04:35:02,667
LAURA: Shorthalt!

3916
04:35:02,667 --> 04:35:09,621
SAM: I don't feel the love! I need to go away for
another year.

3917
04:35:09,621 --> 04:35:11,910
TRAVIS: It's a start.

3918
04:35:11,910 --> 04:35:23,490
MATT: That necromancer, however, is going to
impact in the center of the chamber a burst of

3919
04:35:23,490 --> 04:35:27,112
necrotic energy that billows out from the center
in a 60-foot radius.

3920
04:35:27,112 --> 04:35:29,296
It's going to affect all of you guys.

3921
04:35:29,296 --> 04:35:34,731
LIAM: Me up in the corner?

3922
04:35:34,731 --> 04:35:39,224
MATT: Everyone but you because you're away. Mr.
Way Out of the Way Guy.

3923
04:35:39,224 --> 04:35:41,130
LIAM: It's what I do.

3924
04:35:41,130 --> 04:35:42,551
MARISHA: Ceiling and floor?

3925
04:35:42,551 --> 04:35:48,227
MATT: Ceiling and floor, because it's a large
enough radius where it affects the entire space. I

3926
04:35:48,227 --> 04:35:50,922
need you guys to roll a constitution saving throw
for me, please.

3927
04:35:50,922 --> 04:35:52,084
LAURA: Who?

3928
04:35:52,084 --> 04:35:58,006
MATT: Everybody but Vax. No, it will still affect
Doty.

3929
04:35:58,006 --> 04:36:01,406
TALIESIN: I have advantage because of Cabal.

3930
04:36:01,406 --> 04:36:06,052
LAURA: I suck tonight!

3931
04:36:06,052 --> 04:36:08,014
MARISHA: Yeah!

3932
04:36:08,014 --> 04:36:10,798
LAURA: I can't help it!

3933
04:36:10,798 --> 04:36:20,943
LIAM: Mother bitch!

3934
04:36:20,943 --> 04:36:23,241
SAM: Laura, did you roll?

3935
04:36:23,241 --> 04:36:30,203
LAURA: Oh, I can add inspiration! Okay. No,
that's not going to save me.

3936
04:36:30,203 --> 04:36:32,842
MATT: So over here. Grog?

3937
04:36:32,842 --> 04:36:34,030
TRAVIS: 26.

3938
04:36:34,030 --> 04:36:38,413
MATT: 26. You take 15 points of necrotic damage.
Pike.

3939
04:36:38,413 --> 04:36:39,771
ASHLEY: 15.

3940
04:36:39,771 --> 04:36:42,196
MATT: 15? You take 15 points of necrotic damage.

3941
04:36:42,196 --> 04:36:43,504
LAURA: Ten.

3942
04:36:43,504 --> 04:36:45,520
MATT: You take 30 points of necrotic damage.

3943
04:36:45,520 --> 04:36:47,254
MARISHA: 23.

3944
04:36:47,254 --> 04:36:48,998
MATT: You take 15 points of necrotic damage.

3945
04:36:48,998 --> 04:36:50,035
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

3946
04:36:50,035 --> 04:36:51,637
MATT: 15 points of necrotic damage.

3947
04:36:51,637 --> 04:36:52,526
JON: Ten.

3948
04:36:52,526 --> 04:36:55,308
MATT: 30 points of necrotic damage. Scanlan?

3949
04:36:55,308 --> 04:36:57,483
SAM: 24.

3950
04:36:57,483 --> 04:37:01,200
MATT: 24? You take 15 points of necrotic damage,
and make a concentration check, please.

3951
04:37:01,200 --> 04:37:04,905
Constitution saving throw, with advantage because
you have war caster.

3952
04:37:04,905 --> 04:37:06,086
SAM: Plus anything?

3953
04:37:06,086 --> 04:37:08,479
MATT: Plus your constitution saving throw bonus.

3954
04:37:08,479 --> 04:37:13,451
SAM: Constitution saving throw. It's a lot. 22 on
the first one.

3955
04:37:13,451 --> 04:37:16,595
MATT: You have advantage, but yeah. You maintain
concentration. You're fine.

3956
04:37:16,595 --> 04:37:19,881
All righty, and I need Taryon.

3957
04:37:19,881 --> 04:37:23,057
SAM: 13 plus seven. 20.

3958
04:37:23,057 --> 04:37:29,765
MATT: All right. 15 points of necrotic damage to
Taryon. As the wave fades off, you hear the

3959
04:37:29,765 --> 04:37:37,326
chuckle of the two cultists, and they step
backward into the red sphere.

3960
04:37:37,326 --> 04:37:39,222
TALIESIN: Weren't they on the ceiling?

3961
04:37:39,222 --> 04:37:45,050
MATT: Oh, you're right. Sorry. They were on the
ceiling. Thank you for the reminder!

3962
04:37:45,050 --> 04:37:47,638
TALIESIN: They were my least favorite.

3963
04:37:47,638 --> 04:37:49,084
MATT: I know. Fair enough.

3964
04:37:49,084 --> 04:37:51,553
SAM: Does Doty get hit?

3965
04:37:51,553 --> 04:37:52,849
MATT: Doty does get hit, yes.

3966
04:37:52,849 --> 04:37:53,753
SAM: He's out.

3967
04:37:53,753 --> 04:37:58,527
MATT: Doty is (creak, impact) on the ground. Thank
you for the reminder. Sorry.

3968
04:37:58,527 --> 04:38:00,200
SAM: Wait, how many points?

3969
04:38:00,200 --> 04:38:01,932
MATT: 30. 30 necrotic.

3970
04:38:01,932 --> 04:38:03,208
LAURA: Trinket.

3971
04:38:03,208 --> 04:38:06,706
MATT: Did Trinket roll? Roll for Trinket.

3972
04:38:06,706 --> 04:38:08,203
LAURA: No.

3973
04:38:08,203 --> 04:38:20,944
MATT: 30 points of necrotic for Trinket. All
righty. That ends their go there. Pike?

3974
04:38:20,944 --> 04:38:31,095
ASHLEY: Okay, so I am going to hold my turn until
after Scanlan goes.

3975
04:38:31,095 --> 04:38:36,446
MATT: All you can hold is an action. What action
are you going to hold?

3976
04:38:36,446 --> 04:38:38,654
ASHLEY: I have to tell you what I'm going to do?

3977
04:38:38,654 --> 04:38:43,357
MATT: Essentially, yeah. As opposed to moving your
initiative around in the order, you can still move

3978
04:38:43,357 --> 04:38:47,066
on your turn, and then if you're going to cast or
attack, you start it and then wait for something

3979
04:38:47,066 --> 04:38:49,076
to trigger it and then release it when that
happens.

3980
04:38:49,076 --> 04:38:58,133
ASHLEY: I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt, but I'm
going to hold it until after Scanlan's turn.

3981
04:38:58,133 --> 04:39:00,825
LIAM: He's at the bottom?

3982
04:39:00,825 --> 04:39:02,817
LAURA: She's at the bottom.

3983
04:39:02,817 --> 04:39:08,192
MATT: Scanlan's close to the top. Okay, so you
begin casting Guiding Bolt. What's the trigger?

3984
04:39:08,192 --> 04:39:09,431
For Scanlan to go?

3985
04:39:09,431 --> 04:39:10,543
ASHLEY: For Scanlan to go.

3986
04:39:10,543 --> 04:39:13,594
MATT: Okay. You begin concentrating on the spell.
End of your turn?

3987
04:39:13,594 --> 04:39:15,960
ASHLEY: Yes.

3988
04:39:15,960 --> 04:39:17,450
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

3989
04:39:17,450 --> 04:39:21,542
MARISHA: Okay. How many people are still on the
ceiling with me?

3990
04:39:21,542 --> 04:39:35,916
MATT: Grog, Lionel, and a number of skeletons. The
blackguard, the two other casters over there, the

3991
04:39:35,916 --> 04:39:37,225
minotaur skeleton...

3992
04:39:37,225 --> 04:39:44,829
MARISHA: Okay. I drop form. I'm going to look
around and go, (nervous laughter) and drop my

3993
04:39:44,829 --> 04:39:54,667
staff and do Fire Storm radiating out from me, and
I want to try and avoid Lionel and Grog, but

3994
04:39:54,667 --> 04:39:58,271
basically radiating out, fire floods the ceiling.

3995
04:39:58,271 --> 04:40:15,361
MATT: Okay. You can hit him. (counting) You can
get everyone but these two skeletons, if you want

3996
04:40:15,361 --> 04:40:16,978
to do a swath through that.

3997
04:40:16,978 --> 04:40:18,822
MARISHA: Everyone but the two skeletons?

3998
04:40:18,822 --> 04:40:33,777
MATT: Actually, if you started it here, you could
go... (counting) You can either avoid the two

3999
04:40:33,777 --> 04:40:36,413
skeletons or avoid one of those casters. Your
call.

4000
04:40:36,413 --> 04:40:37,921
MARISHA: No, fuck the casters.

4001
04:40:37,921 --> 04:40:41,884
MATT: So those two skeletons next to you:
untouched. Everything else in there has to make a

4002
04:40:41,884 --> 04:40:47,502
dexterity saving throw against a DC 21. Natural 20
on that first skeleton.

4003
04:40:47,502 --> 04:40:49,108
MARISHA: What a dick!

4004
04:40:49,108 --> 04:41:01,174
MATT: Minotaur does not make it. Let's see.
Blackguard does not make it. Natural 20 on that

4005
04:41:01,174 --> 04:41:09,331
caster there, and a 13 on that one. So this one
fails, that caster succeeds, blackguard fails,

4006
04:41:09,396 --> 04:41:13,417
minotaur fails, skeleton succeeds. Roll damage on
that.

4007
04:41:13,417 --> 04:41:37,481
MARISHA: I get to reroll ones. (counting) 26. Roll
two more. 12 more damage. What did I just say?

4008
04:41:37,481 --> 04:41:38,925
TALIESIN: 26.

4009
04:41:38,925 --> 04:41:43,643
MARISHA: 26, plus 12 more. 38 damage.

4010
04:41:43,643 --> 04:41:56,101
MATT: 38 points of damage. This skeleton is burned
into ash and destroyed. The minotaur skeleton, even though

4011
04:41:56,101 --> 04:42:00,518
it made the save with a 20, it had taken damage
from the fall earlier and it was enough to wipe it

4012
04:42:00,518 --> 04:42:14,844
out. Minotaur skeleton, with that last bit, also
burns up. The flames burn around the blackguard,

4013
04:42:14,844 --> 04:42:20,891
but it stands there, defiant. It seems to almost
be relishing the pain as it burns and tears

4014
04:42:20,891 --> 04:42:27,624
through its armor. You don't see a face. All you
see is black armor, jagged at the tips, long cloak

4015
04:42:27,624 --> 04:42:31,199
that is burned to the back, big glaive that spins
in his arm.

4016
04:42:31,199 --> 04:42:32,520
TRAVIS: Where is he?

4017
04:42:32,520 --> 04:42:36,094
MATT: Right there. He takes half the damage.

4018
04:42:36,094 --> 04:42:40,117
TALIESIN: Is he on fire, too?

4019
04:42:40,117 --> 04:42:48,725
MATT: It doesn't set them on fire. All righty.
Keyleth, that's your action. What else are you

4020
04:42:48,725 --> 04:42:49,740
going to do?

4021
04:42:49,740 --> 04:42:53,599
MARISHA: Can I move any? Can I back out of
wherever I am? Where am I?

4022
04:42:53,599 --> 04:42:56,639
MATT: You're right there. Two skeletons get
attacks of opportunity on you if you move.

4023
04:42:56,639 --> 04:42:59,622
It's up to you.

4024
04:42:59,622 --> 04:43:06,828
MARISHA: I'll stay. Let me back out of it.

4025
04:43:06,828 --> 04:43:12,216
MATT: Okay. Two attacks of opportunity on you.
That is a 24?

4026
04:43:12,216 --> 04:43:13,432
MARISHA: Yeah.

4027
04:43:13,432 --> 04:43:15,510
MATT: And a 17.

4028
04:43:15,510 --> 04:43:16,980
MARISHA: Yeah.

4029
04:43:16,980 --> 04:43:19,519
MATT: All right. You take 22 points of slashing
damage.

4030
04:43:19,519 --> 04:43:21,020
LIAM: Sorry, honey.

4031
04:43:21,020 --> 04:43:22,421
MARISHA: It's okay.

4032
04:43:22,421 --> 04:43:27,366
LIAM: You're fine. Oh, you're dead.

4033
04:43:27,366 --> 04:43:28,680
MARISHA: I'm fine.

4034
04:43:28,680 --> 04:43:42,967
MATT: Okay. Delilah.

4035
04:43:42,967 --> 04:43:46,874
SAM: Wait, she goes through the thing?!

4036
04:43:46,874 --> 04:43:48,828
MATT: Yeah. She walks through.

4037
04:43:48,828 --> 04:43:50,512
LIAM: She can go wherever the fuck she wants.

4038
04:43:50,512 --> 04:44:04,843
MATT: She's going to make a dexterity check to
hold on right there, and she rolls a 23. No, a 22.

4039
04:44:04,843 --> 04:44:16,137
Your DC is 22 for Scanlan? She just steps out of
it and holds onto the edge. Actually, she wouldn't

4040
04:44:16,137 --> 04:44:21,096
have had to do that. She steps to the edge. She
succeeded, but she basically just looks out of the

4041
04:44:21,096 --> 04:44:26,335
sphere. You watch her face appear out, and her hand.
She begins to look around for her next target.

4042
04:44:26,335 --> 04:44:30,487
LIAM: Matt Mercer in drag, shitting all over us.

4043
04:44:30,487 --> 04:44:34,304
SAM: All it ever has been.

4044
04:44:34,304 --> 04:44:47,241
MATT: She looks over at you, Pike, and goes, "Not
this time, my dear." I need you-- Delilah's got the

4045
04:44:47,241 --> 04:44:53,828
Player's Handbook-- I need you to make an
intelligence saving throw, please.

4046
04:44:53,828 --> 04:44:59,822
ASHLEY: Intelligence saving throw? Okay, I get
advantages. Okay.

4047
04:44:59,822 --> 04:45:04,368
LAURA: Don't jinx this.

4048
04:45:04,368 --> 04:45:08,805
TRAVIS: The same fucking thing.

4049
04:45:08,805 --> 04:45:10,677
LIAM: Two eights. Holy fuck.

4050
04:45:10,677 --> 04:45:11,931
ASHLEY: Nine.

4051
04:45:11,931 --> 04:45:26,660
MATT: Nine. As her finger reaches out to you, your
brain goes a little numb and a little fuzzy, and

4052
04:45:26,660 --> 04:45:35,602
the spell that you were preparing dissipates, and
conscious thought becomes difficult as the

4053
04:45:35,602 --> 04:45:37,268
Feeblemind spell takes effect.

4054
04:45:37,268 --> 04:45:39,129
MARISHA: No! Bitch!

4055
04:45:39,129 --> 04:45:42,030
LAURA: What works on Feeblemind?

4056
04:45:42,030 --> 04:45:43,530
MARISHA: This is my karma!

4057
04:45:43,530 --> 04:45:49,148
MATT: Your intelligence and charisma become one.
You can't cast spells, you cannot understand

4058
04:45:49,148 --> 04:45:51,427
language or communicate in any intelligible way.

4059
04:45:51,427 --> 04:45:55,249
MARISHA: I might be able to do a Greater
Restoration on you, but I don't know

4060
04:45:55,249 --> 04:45:58,261
if I can help you there.

4061
04:45:58,261 --> 04:46:02,187
LAURA: Tiberius had it one time. How did we heal
him?

4062
04:46:02,187 --> 04:46:03,960
MARISHA: It was a restoration spell.

4063
04:46:03,960 --> 04:46:08,462
MATT: She steps, laughing, back into the orb.

4064
04:46:08,462 --> 04:46:12,621
LIAM: Back into the Skittle? Fuck you, Delilah.
Holy shit!

4065
04:46:12,621 --> 04:46:14,914
MATT: Percy, you're up.

4066
04:46:14,914 --> 04:46:18,011
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it.

4067
04:46:18,011 --> 04:46:21,821
TRAVIS: Can you point to where Pike is on the map?
Okay.

4068
04:46:21,821 --> 04:46:29,267
TALIESIN: I'm going to continue further down the
wall towards the evil orb of death.

4069
04:46:29,267 --> 04:46:30,548
MATT: Okay.

4070
04:46:30,548 --> 04:46:36,242
TALIESIN: Is that as far as I can get?

4071
04:46:36,242 --> 04:46:38,554
MATT: That's as far as you can get in a 30-foot
movement, yeah.

4072
04:46:38,554 --> 04:46:42,640
TALIESIN: Okay. And the cultist closest to me on
the ceiling?

4073
04:46:42,640 --> 04:46:46,457
MATT: That's going to be that one right there.

4074
04:46:46,457 --> 04:46:52,130
TALIESIN: That one right there? Let's do some
damage with Animus, and let's add a sharpshooter

4075
04:46:52,130 --> 04:46:53,583
for it, just for fun.

4076
04:46:53,583 --> 04:46:54,978
MATT: Okay.

4077
04:46:54,978 --> 04:46:56,961
TALIESIN: That's 16 to hit.

4078
04:46:56,961 --> 04:47:00,268
MATT: 16 to hit does not hit.

4079
04:47:00,268 --> 04:47:03,978
TALIESIN: Hold on, I may have done that wrong. 17
to hit.

4080
04:47:03,978 --> 04:47:10,917
MATT: Still does not hit. As soon as you fire, it
hits but it sparks off what looks like big plate

4081
04:47:10,917 --> 04:47:15,753
armor on this caster that the robes were
obscuring. As it hits, it tears through the cloth

4082
04:47:15,753 --> 04:47:18,014
and you see the reflection of armor beneath.

4083
04:47:18,014 --> 04:47:28,222
TALIESIN: That's irritating. All right, forget
sharpshooter. One more. That's better. 24 to hit.

4084
04:47:28,222 --> 04:47:29,854
MATT: 24 hits, yeah.

4085
04:47:29,854 --> 04:47:40,735
TALIESIN: This is not the one I have the Hex on,
right? Okay, that's fine. I should have done that

4086
04:47:40,735 --> 04:47:44,080
differently. 12 points of damage and one point of
psychic damage.

4087
04:47:44,080 --> 04:47:50,342
MATT: All righty. This does hit. (gunshot) Doesn't
seem to affect him much.

4088
04:47:50,342 --> 04:47:54,973
TALIESIN: He's still fine, isn't he? That's fine.
I'm going to hit him again.

4089
04:47:54,973 --> 04:47:57,837
MATT: Go for it. Scanlan, you're up next.

4090
04:47:57,837 --> 04:48:09,871
TALIESIN: That's like 35 to hit. Jesus Christ, I
rolled a 19. And that's 17 points of damage and

4091
04:48:09,871 --> 04:48:11,796
one point of psychic damage.

4092
04:48:11,796 --> 04:48:20,047
MATT: All righty. Still standing. Not showing any
wear and tear. Taking damage, but does not appear

4093
04:48:20,047 --> 04:48:22,776
to be wounded significantly.

4094
04:48:22,776 --> 04:48:40,137
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my bonus to heal myself
a little bit because goddamn it. Oh, Jesus.

4095
04:48:40,137 --> 04:48:44,056
JON: You're attacking who?

4096
04:48:44,056 --> 04:48:47,939
TALIESIN: I'm attacking one of the cultists. I'm
up to 120 hit points now.

4097
04:48:47,939 --> 04:48:51,228
MATT: This isn't the one in the fully dark armor.
This is the one that has armor under a cloak. It

4098
04:48:51,228 --> 04:48:57,295
looks like an older man's face. Has this staff at
the side and a mace hanging from the belt and is

4099
04:48:57,295 --> 04:49:00,222
currently casting spells from the ceiling right
now.

4100
04:49:00,222 --> 04:49:04,322
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. I wanted to throw some
electricity on it and I blanked because my brain

4101
04:49:04,322 --> 04:49:06,568
is made of Swiss cheese. Is it too late?

4102
04:49:06,568 --> 04:49:07,707
MATT: I'll let you throw it on.

4103
04:49:07,707 --> 04:49:16,843
TALIESIN: I'm going to add-- on that last shot,
I'm going to add 5d6 worth of electricity damage.

4104
04:49:16,843 --> 04:49:18,475
MATT: Go for it.

4105
04:49:18,475 --> 04:49:25,386
TALIESIN: (counting) 16 points of lightning
damage.

4106
04:49:25,386 --> 04:49:27,555
MATT: 16 points of lightning damage.

4107
04:49:27,555 --> 04:49:37,063
TALIESIN: That's five Cabal's. (blast) Five
Cabal's.

4108
04:49:37,063 --> 04:49:41,197
MATT: All righty. That ends your turn, Percival?

4109
04:49:41,197 --> 04:49:42,776
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4110
04:49:42,776 --> 04:49:44,400
MATT: Scanlan, you're up.

4111
04:49:44,400 --> 04:49:46,322
SAM: I don't have much.

4112
04:49:46,322 --> 04:49:48,245
TALIESIN: Really?

4113
04:49:48,245 --> 04:49:51,677
MARISHA: You've always ever said that.

4114
04:49:51,677 --> 04:49:53,768
TALIESIN: You always say that. That doesn't mean
anything.

4115
04:49:53,768 --> 04:49:57,333
TRAVIS: The minotaur's down, right?

4116
04:49:57,333 --> 04:50:00,068
MATT: The minotaur fell, yeah. It was incinerated
by the Fire Storm.

4117
04:50:00,068 --> 04:50:01,923
LAURA: It's cultists and Delilah left?

4118
04:50:01,923 --> 04:50:03,413
MATT: And some skeletons.

4119
04:50:03,413 --> 04:50:05,179
TRAVIS: And a dark paladin's still up there.

4120
04:50:05,179 --> 04:50:06,956
MARISHA: The blackguard, yeah.

4121
04:50:06,956 --> 04:50:10,963
JON: The one who's got all that black. The really
powerful one.

4122
04:50:10,963 --> 04:50:12,133
LAURA: Okay.

4123
04:50:12,133 --> 04:50:13,786
TALIESIN: It's possible we can run straight into
the ball.

4124
04:50:13,786 --> 04:50:16,521
SAM: Who's with me? Who's near me? Nobody, right?

4125
04:50:16,521 --> 04:50:22,522
MATT: Right now? Nobody is near you. Right, Pike
is right next to you.

4126
04:50:22,522 --> 04:50:37,824
SAM: I can't do anything to Pike or with Pike.
(fake sobs) All right. I'll inspire myself. The

4127
04:50:37,824 --> 04:50:48,517
saddest inspiration. (singing) It's raining
gnomes. Hallelujah, it's raining gnomes.

4128
04:50:48,517 --> 04:51:00,721
Everywhere we go. Short, stout, tough, and mean.
The handsomest I've ever seen.

4129
04:51:00,721 --> 04:51:03,345
MATT: What are you doing?

4130
04:51:03,345 --> 04:51:09,458
SAM: I'm going to Dimension Door into the orb,
into the whatever this thing is.

4131
04:51:09,458 --> 04:51:11,013
The prismatic ball.

4132
04:51:11,013 --> 04:51:12,951
MATT: Okay.

4133
04:51:12,951 --> 04:51:19,093
LAURA: If it's doable to pass through a magic
barrier.

4134
04:51:19,093 --> 04:51:22,006
TALIESIN: It might be concentration-based, and if
he can knock it out...

4135
04:51:22,006 --> 04:51:26,412
ASHLEY: Clever gnome.

4136
04:51:26,412 --> 04:51:29,901
LIAM: Come on, baby.

4137
04:51:29,901 --> 04:51:32,837
MATT: I'm going to check one thing. This is
important,

4138
04:51:32,837 --> 04:51:35,191
because this will make a big difference.

4139
04:51:35,191 --> 04:51:39,699
LAURA: Is it an action to drop anti-gravity?

4140
04:51:39,699 --> 04:51:42,044
SAM: I can do it at will.

4141
04:51:42,044 --> 04:51:44,532
LAURA: They'll all get bludgeoning damage from the
fall.

4142
04:51:44,532 --> 04:51:45,806
SAM: So will you.

4143
04:51:45,806 --> 04:51:47,246
LAURA: I'm not on the ceiling.

4144
04:51:47,246 --> 04:51:48,385
MATT: All right.

4145
04:51:48,385 --> 04:51:56,436
SAM: Not into the orb of death.

4146
04:51:56,436 --> 04:52:09,496
MATT: But inside the sphere. I understand. I will
say, as is the nature of the spell versus a

4147
04:52:09,496 --> 04:52:18,915
Dimension Door, I need you, as you begin to pass
through, your form folds through the magic, the

4148
04:52:18,915 --> 04:52:29,260
very powerful magic and intent of this sphere. The
dome of red hits you immediately. I need you to

4149
04:52:29,260 --> 04:52:34,015
make a dexterity saving throw, please.

4150
04:52:34,015 --> 04:52:37,951
SAM: Two.

4151
04:52:37,951 --> 04:52:39,343
MATT: Two.

4152
04:52:39,343 --> 04:52:45,891
SAM: Oh, wait. Plus six. That's eight. Plus, I'm
inspired.

4153
04:52:45,891 --> 04:52:48,894
MATT: You can inspire and roll on top of that, if
you want.

4154
04:52:48,894 --> 04:52:52,171
SAM: Ten. So 18.

4155
04:52:52,171 --> 04:52:55,983
MATT: 18. Not enough. All right.

4156
04:52:55,983 --> 04:53:02,106
TALIESIN: Oh god, there's a lot of d6 I hear
rolling.

4157
04:53:02,106 --> 04:53:09,113
MATT: You take 28 points of fire damage for the
red. As soon as you flash through, and there's

4158
04:53:09,113 --> 04:53:11,436
orange behind it. I need you to make another
dexterity saving throw.

4159
04:53:11,436 --> 04:53:14,727
LAURA: Oh no, it's a whole rainbow!

4160
04:53:14,727 --> 04:53:16,829
JON: Rainbow, ending with indigo!

4161
04:53:16,829 --> 04:53:21,101
SAM: 18.

4162
04:53:21,101 --> 04:53:22,499
MATT: 18.

4163
04:53:22,499 --> 04:53:24,802
TALIESIN: Oh no.

4164
04:53:24,802 --> 04:53:32,505
LIAM: And if you make it in, you're in a death
box.

4165
04:53:32,505 --> 04:53:43,880
MATT: You take 34 points of force damage. Sorry,
lightning damage on this. Acid damage. I'm reading

4166
04:53:43,880 --> 04:53:45,009
the wrong one.

4167
04:53:45,009 --> 04:53:46,263
SAM: Acid, I get halved.

4168
04:53:46,263 --> 04:53:48,954
MATT: All right, so you take 17 points of acid
damage.

4169
04:53:48,954 --> 04:53:50,161
TALIESIN: Oh god.

4170
04:53:50,161 --> 04:53:56,652
MATT: You pass through that into yellow. Make
another dexterity saving throw.

4171
04:53:56,652 --> 04:54:00,455
SAM: I thought Dimension Door, I disappear to
another plane and reappear.

4172
04:54:00,455 --> 04:54:08,724
MATT: The essence of this 9th-level spell is to
not let anything pass through it.

4173
04:54:08,724 --> 04:54:10,352
SAM: All right. Keep it coming.

4174
04:54:10,352 --> 04:54:12,001
MATT: Make a dexterity saving throw.

4175
04:54:12,001 --> 04:54:14,482
SAM: 16.

4176
04:54:14,482 --> 04:54:16,337
MATT: All right.

4177
04:54:16,337 --> 04:54:25,871
TALIESIN: Can he bounce off at some point and stop
pulling through this fucking rainbow of death?

4178
04:54:25,871 --> 04:54:36,746
MATT: This is the first time that I've used this,
so I'm making sure that I can...

4179
04:54:36,746 --> 04:54:43,541
LIAM: Scanlan Shorthalt, killed by ROYGBIV.

4180
04:54:43,541 --> 04:54:45,906
MARISHA: What fucking spell is this?

4181
04:54:45,906 --> 04:54:51,530
MATT: You know what?

4182
04:54:51,530 --> 04:54:54,008
SAM: No, keep it coming. I got this.

4183
04:54:54,008 --> 04:55:00,443
MATT: No, based on how it's written, it's passing
through the sphere.

4184
04:55:00,443 --> 04:55:02,132
SAM: What do you mean, passing through?

4185
04:55:02,194 --> 04:55:07,857
MATT: Physically passing through the sphere, so I
will say, looking at the rules now and really

4186
04:55:07,857 --> 04:55:10,063
thinking about how it's worded. It doesn't say
otherwise.

4187
04:55:10,063 --> 04:55:13,435
I'll say you can teleport into the sphere.

4188
04:55:13,435 --> 04:55:16,134
LAURA: Oh my god. You're going to another plane!

4189
04:55:16,134 --> 04:55:17,668
TRAVIS: It's not a gimme.

4190
04:55:17,668 --> 04:55:19,419
MATT: I'm going to take that damage back.

4191
04:55:19,419 --> 04:55:23,943
SAM: I can take it, Matt. Bring it!

4192
04:55:23,943 --> 04:55:29,607
MATT: No. You've made a valid point, and the spell
does specify "pass through it." You do not pass

4193
04:55:29,607 --> 04:55:33,447
through it. You appear on the other side. So
what's the range on that?

4194
04:55:33,447 --> 04:55:35,361
SAM: 500 feet.

4195
04:55:35,361 --> 04:55:44,491
MATT: You appear inside. You appear within, and
you're now on the inside. You can see, the bright

4196
04:55:44,491 --> 04:55:53,068
colors are there, blinding you from the interior.
Make a constitution saving throw.

4197
04:55:53,068 --> 04:55:56,355
LIAM: Congratulations. You're in a prison cell
with Charles Manson.

4198
04:55:56,355 --> 04:55:57,670
SAM: 15.

4199
04:55:57,670 --> 04:55:58,694
MATT: 15.

4200
04:55:58,694 --> 04:56:00,320
SAM: I still have my inspiration.

4201
04:56:00,320 --> 04:56:01,521
MATT: You do.

4202
04:56:01,521 --> 04:56:03,631
SAM: 18.

4203
04:56:03,631 --> 04:56:09,135
MATT: Okay. The good news is, you didn't take any
of that damage as you bamf inside the sphere. Bad

4204
04:56:09,135 --> 04:56:10,591
news is, you're blinded for a minute.

4205
04:56:10,591 --> 04:56:11,926
SAM: Great.

4206
04:56:11,926 --> 04:56:19,595
MATT: The colors are so bright in there, your eyes
immediately go stark, flashing white. You cannot

4207
04:56:19,595 --> 04:56:20,887
see anything in there.

4208
04:56:20,887 --> 04:56:22,434
SAM: Great.

4209
04:56:22,434 --> 04:56:25,725
LIAM: Hi, my name's Jeffrey Dahmer. Welcome to my
Prismatic Sphere.

4210
04:56:25,725 --> 04:56:29,558
TALIESIN: You know, I would watch Jeffrey Dahmer's
Prismatic Sphere.

4211
04:56:29,558 --> 04:56:32,197
MATT: Scanlan, that's your action.

4212
04:56:32,197 --> 04:56:34,392
SAM: And my bonus.

4213
04:56:34,392 --> 04:56:35,682
MATT: Is that your turn?

4214
04:56:35,682 --> 04:56:42,821
SAM: Yeah, that's it. That's all I've got. I can't
see the danger I'm in.

4215
04:56:42,821 --> 04:56:46,841
MATT: That's true. However, you didn't take any
damage, so you didn't lose your concentration on

4216
04:56:46,841 --> 04:56:58,810
the spell. You're just blinded. All right, so now
those cultists have all been slain. I forgot to do

4217
04:56:58,810 --> 04:57:02,802
the skeletons last time, so I'll have them move
in. These two skeletons are going to rush in. This

4218
04:57:02,802 --> 04:57:17,708
one's going to go ahead and... 25. That's four
skeletons on you, Keyleth.

4219
04:57:17,708 --> 04:57:20,180
MARISHA: Four skeletons on me?

4220
04:57:20,180 --> 04:57:27,417
MATT: Yeah. Eight misses you. 13 misses you, I'm
pretty sure. Eight again.

4221
04:57:27,417 --> 04:57:28,900
MARISHA: Miss!

4222
04:57:28,900 --> 04:57:34,313
MATT: And a 24. You take 11 points of slashing
damage. Three of them are swinging at you and

4223
04:57:34,313 --> 04:57:36,755
you're dodging out of the way, and then one of
them catches you across the shoulder and you're

4224
04:57:36,755 --> 04:57:41,409
like, (grunts). All right, that ends their go.
Grog.

4225
04:57:41,409 --> 04:57:46,454
TRAVIS: I'm going to charge in towards the
pedestal. What's the first thing that I reach?

4226
04:57:46,454 --> 04:57:50,518
MATT: The first thing that you reach over here is
a skeleton.

4227
04:57:50,518 --> 04:57:53,480
TRAVIS: Yeah. Reckless, great weapon master.

4228
04:57:53,480 --> 04:57:55,003
MATT: Go for it.

4229
04:57:55,003 --> 04:58:01,462
TRAVIS: 27?

4230
04:58:01,462 --> 04:58:08,665
MATT: That hits. Minimum damage, you destroy it,
because of the great weapon master. You walk up,

4231
04:58:08,665 --> 04:58:12,823
smash. There's one also adjacent to you there.

4232
04:58:12,823 --> 04:58:14,258
TRAVIS: Yep. Him, too.

4233
04:58:14,258 --> 04:58:15,690
MATT: Go for it.

4234
04:58:15,690 --> 04:58:23,797
TRAVIS: Reckless again. 20, even.

4235
04:58:23,797 --> 04:58:29,693
MATT: 20 hits. Minimum damage shatters that
skeleton. You can move five feet in and get a

4236
04:58:29,693 --> 04:58:32,089
third one, if you'd like.

4237
04:58:32,089 --> 04:58:37,501
TRAVIS: Actually, I would like to smash the
Titanstone Knuckles

4238
04:58:37,501 --> 04:58:39,281
together and cast Enlarge on myself.

4239
04:58:39,281 --> 04:58:54,199
MATT: Okay. So instead, you go into full,
large-size Grog mode here. (impact sound) There

4240
04:58:54,199 --> 04:58:55,365
you have it.

4241
04:58:55,365 --> 04:58:57,256
TRAVIS: Fee fie foe, you're fucked.

4242
04:58:57,256 --> 04:59:00,620
MATT: That's your turn, Grog? Lionel.

4243
04:59:00,620 --> 04:59:03,404
JON: Okay. Who's the closest to me?

4244
04:59:03,404 --> 04:59:07,287
MATT: Closest to you are the skeletons here, or if
you wanted to rush around and get the guy with the

4245
04:59:07,287 --> 04:59:08,606
big heavy armor.

4246
04:59:08,606 --> 04:59:10,619
JON: That's the old guy?

4247
04:59:10,619 --> 04:59:16,459
MATT: There's an old one with a staff, there's a
black knight in all the armor with the halberd, or

4248
04:59:16,459 --> 04:59:17,726
there's some skeletons.

4249
04:59:17,726 --> 04:59:19,618
JON: Can I make it over to the black knight?

4250
04:59:19,618 --> 04:59:21,080
MATT: Yeah, you can make it over to him.

4251
04:59:21,080 --> 04:59:22,111
JON: Yeah.

4252
04:59:22,111 --> 04:59:25,251
MATT: You get up to him right there.

4253
04:59:25,251 --> 04:59:41,463
JON: Is there any of my teammates? I want to give
bardic inspiration to someone. Are you close? You

4254
04:59:41,463 --> 04:59:47,064
need it? I'm going to give you--

4255
04:59:47,064 --> 04:59:52,393
MARISHA: We're upside-down on the ceiling.

4256
04:59:52,393 --> 04:59:55,163
JON: L-E-T-S-G-O. Let's go, let's go.

4257
04:59:55,163 --> 04:59:57,412
(laughter)

4258
04:59:57,412 --> 04:59:59,683
MARISHA: I'm like, you know how to spell, Lionel!

4259
04:59:59,683 --> 05:00:01,338
JON: That's the only thing I learned.

4260
05:00:01,338 --> 05:00:03,158
MARISHA: I'm so impressed.

4261
05:00:03,158 --> 05:00:04,769
JON: It's the only song I know, but it works.

4262
05:00:04,769 --> 05:00:06,390
MARISHA: How much do I get?

4263
05:00:06,390 --> 05:00:08,414
MATT: You take a d8, I think?

4264
05:00:08,414 --> 05:00:11,237
JON: 1d8 times three per short rest.

4265
05:00:11,237 --> 05:00:13,898
MATT: Yeah, you can use it three times. You get a
d8 inspiration die, Keyleth.

4266
05:00:13,898 --> 05:00:17,325
LIAM and MARISHA: Be aggressive.

4267
05:00:17,325 --> 05:00:25,480
JON: I'm going to do a Hold Person. I want to hold
that guy.

4268
05:00:25,480 --> 05:00:29,187
MATT: All right. He's going to make a wisdom
saving throw. What's your spell DC?

4269
05:00:29,187 --> 05:00:34,935
JON: 16.

4270
05:00:34,935 --> 05:00:37,121
MATT: 16. Natural 20.

4271
05:00:37,121 --> 05:00:39,808
JON: So it doesn't work.

4272
05:00:39,808 --> 05:00:43,747
MATT: No. As you begin to cast the spell on him
and you reach out for his mind to clench it, he

4273
05:00:43,747 --> 05:00:48,412
(chuckles) and readies his halberd. No effect.

4274
05:00:48,412 --> 05:00:54,398
JON: Okay. Don't I have another attack? Is raging
done with now?

4275
05:00:54,398 --> 05:00:58,235
MATT: You're still raging. You can maintain your
rage as long as you're attacking things. You used

4276
05:00:58,235 --> 05:01:01,686
your action to cast the spell instead of
attacking.

4277
05:01:01,686 --> 05:01:03,834
JON: So my turn is done.

4278
05:01:03,834 --> 05:01:08,050
MATT: That's your turn, yeah. Unfortunately.
Sorry, man. All righty, Taryon.

4279
05:01:08,050 --> 05:01:16,806
SAM: I don't think I can get through that thing,
can I? I'll fly up closer to the orb.

4280
05:01:16,806 --> 05:01:19,802
TALIESIN: We still have two cultists full of
magic.

4281
05:01:19,802 --> 05:01:21,150
SAM: Oh. Where are they?

4282
05:01:21,150 --> 05:01:22,666
TALIESIN: They're above you.

4283
05:01:22,666 --> 05:01:23,910
SAM: They're right above me?

4284
05:01:23,910 --> 05:01:25,062
TALIESIN: On the roof.

4285
05:01:25,062 --> 05:01:36,994
SAM: Oh. Well, then I'll attack them, I guess. How
wide is my Prismatic Spray cone?

4286
05:01:36,994 --> 05:01:41,883
MATT: How wide is your Prismatic Spray cone?
What's the cone size on it that it says?

4287
05:01:41,883 --> 05:01:45,264
SAM: It's just the standard Prismatic Spray
spell.

4288
05:01:45,264 --> 05:01:50,358
TALIESIN: It's your everyday Prismatic Spray. It
sprays in a cone.

4289
05:01:50,358 --> 05:01:53,360
It's a sugar cone, not a waffle cone.

4290
05:01:53,360 --> 05:02:04,257
MATT: Prismatic Spray I'm pretty sure is a 60-foot
cone. So it is this big old fun guy.

4291
05:02:04,257 --> 05:02:06,306
What are you doing?

4292
05:02:06,306 --> 05:02:13,168
SAM: Will it hit the protective thing, as well as
the people on the ceiling?

4293
05:02:13,168 --> 05:02:20,832
MATT: You can try and spray them, as it is a cone.
You can aim it up probably to catch the edge of it.

4294
05:02:20,832 --> 05:02:25,153
SAM: I'm mainly aiming at the two dudes above.

4295
05:02:25,153 --> 05:02:33,774
MATT: All right, so you can hit those guys and the
blackguard, if you want to. All righty, so roll a d8.

4296
05:02:33,774 --> 05:02:38,353
SAM: A d8? Just 1d8?

4297
05:02:38,353 --> 05:02:40,449
MATT: For that guy there.

4298
05:02:40,449 --> 05:02:44,152
SAM: Oh, that's right, to pick the color. Four.

4299
05:02:44,152 --> 05:02:48,572
MATT: All righty, that's green, so poison for him.
For the sphere?

4300
05:02:48,572 --> 05:02:50,413
SAM: Seven.

4301
05:02:50,413 --> 05:02:57,099
MATT: Seven for the sphere. That is violet. No
effect. Okay, that guy there?

4302
05:02:57,099 --> 05:02:59,047
SAM: Two.

4303
05:02:59,047 --> 05:03:04,010
MATT: Two. Orange. Acid. And the guard.

4304
05:03:04,010 --> 05:03:07,010
SAM: Five.

4305
05:03:07,010 --> 05:03:18,041
MATT: Five. Cold. All right, so roll 10d6. Failure
for him. Failure for the blackguard, who rolled a

4306
05:03:18,041 --> 05:03:21,209
four. All three of them fail.

4307
05:03:21,209 --> 05:03:38,595
SAM: Okay. (counting) 39.

4308
05:03:38,595 --> 05:03:57,885
MATT: 39. All righty... This war priest over here,
the one on the far end, as you strike. That was

4309
05:03:57,885 --> 05:04:07,969
with the acid ray. The green ray strikes him and
he goes (death rattle) and slowly dissolves into a

4310
05:04:07,969 --> 05:04:17,709
pile of purplish-red mush that begins to smear
across the roof. The other two are impacted by it,

4311
05:04:17,709 --> 05:04:21,640
and they're reeling from the pain. They're
starting to show some real wear and tear now.

4312
05:04:21,719 --> 05:04:24,769
That's going to end yours?

4313
05:04:24,769 --> 05:04:29,128
SAM: Yeah, pretty much. Oh, and I'll fly closer to
the sphere. I said that already.

4314
05:04:29,128 --> 05:04:30,582
MATT: Yeah. Vax.

4315
05:04:30,582 --> 05:04:39,503
LIAM: Oh, I'm up? Lionel is right on that dark
paladin, right?

4316
05:04:39,503 --> 05:04:40,668
MATT: That is correct.

4317
05:04:40,668 --> 05:04:44,510
LIAM: All right. I would like to use my movement
to fly. It's probably not all of it, but 120 feet

4318
05:04:44,510 --> 05:04:47,506
to get to his backside and stab him in the back.

4319
05:04:47,506 --> 05:04:48,870
MATT: You can get there.

4320
05:04:48,870 --> 05:04:50,236
LIAM: We'll start with that.

4321
05:04:50,236 --> 05:04:53,057
MATT: You rush in.

4322
05:04:53,057 --> 05:04:55,990
LIAM: That is a 19.

4323
05:04:55,990 --> 05:04:58,429
MATT: 19 will hit, yes.

4324
05:04:58,429 --> 05:05:08,331
LIAM: All right, so that is sneak attack damage.
He gets three plus eight is 11, plus... where the

4325
05:05:08,331 --> 05:05:32,309
hell did my d8 go? Okay, 16 plus sneak attack
damage. (counting) 45.

4326
05:05:32,309 --> 05:05:33,955
So that guy took 45 in the back.

4327
05:05:33,955 --> 05:05:39,173
MATT: Yes, and as you rush down with the speed of
an elven bullet, you drive the blade right into

4328
05:05:39,173 --> 05:05:43,070
the center of the armor plates, and you watch as
he's chuckling with his glaive out, glaring at

4329
05:05:43,070 --> 05:05:51,180
Lionel. (chuckles, death rattle, thud) And falls
dead to the ground.

4330
05:05:51,180 --> 05:05:56,611
LIAM: Perfect. So that's movement, action, and
what I have left is hasted action and bonus

4331
05:05:56,611 --> 05:06:02,069
action, so I would like to use my bonus action to
zip over to Pike, 120 feet.

4332
05:06:02,069 --> 05:06:04,082
MATT: As a dash. Okay.

4333
05:06:04,082 --> 05:06:11,086
LIAM: Yeah, and use my hasted action to carry her
out of here, out where there's nobody. Towards the

4334
05:06:11,086 --> 05:06:12,582
end of your map.

4335
05:06:12,582 --> 05:06:15,594
MATT: Okay, grabbing her, you can move at half
movement to try and pull her along.

4336
05:06:15,594 --> 05:06:16,830
LIAM: That's 60 feet.

4337
05:06:16,830 --> 05:06:20,710
MATT: Correct. You get her about over here.

4338
05:06:20,710 --> 05:06:22,001
LIAM: That's great.

4339
05:06:22,001 --> 05:06:24,555
MATT: That ends your turn.

4340
05:06:24,555 --> 05:06:29,686
LIAM: I give her a bonus-bonus action to tousle
her hair. Next.

4341
05:06:29,686 --> 05:06:32,514
MATT: Easy enough with the wind blowing around.
Vex.

4342
05:06:32,514 --> 05:06:40,018
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to take aim at the other
cultist. I'm going to Hunter's Mark them. That's

4343
05:06:40,018 --> 05:06:41,701
the old one with the staff?

4344
05:06:41,701 --> 05:06:49,023
MATT: There are two of them that appear to be
staff wielders. The older one has been destroyed with

4345
05:06:49,023 --> 05:06:51,683
acid. The other one you haven't really gotten
close enough to see the face of.

4346
05:06:51,683 --> 05:06:53,194
LAURA: But they're holding a staff?

4347
05:06:53,194 --> 05:06:54,190
MATT: Yeah.

4348
05:06:54,190 --> 05:07:00,787
LAURA: I'm going to bramble shot that one. No.
Yeah, I'm going to bramble shot the one that I

4349
05:07:00,787 --> 05:07:03,552
haven't seen his face yet.

4350
05:07:03,552 --> 05:07:05,116
MATT: Okay, so roll to attack.

4351
05:07:05,116 --> 05:07:10,878
LAURA: That was a 33.

4352
05:07:10,878 --> 05:07:13,189
MATT: Yeah, that will hit. Roll damage.

4353
05:07:13,189 --> 05:07:27,501
LAURA: Okay. (counting) Nobody's standing next to
him, right?

4354
05:07:27,501 --> 05:07:28,861
MATT: Nope.

4355
05:07:28,861 --> 05:07:46,347
LAURA: (counting) 27. So 27 damage, and then DC of
17. Strength DC of 17.

4356
05:07:46,347 --> 05:07:48,507
LIAM: You're a fucking beast.

4357
05:07:48,507 --> 05:07:53,818
MATT: Does not succeed. He is restrained. (grunts)
As you slam with the arrow from the other side,

4358
05:07:53,818 --> 05:07:59,165
(grunts) the vines curl up and wrap around,
constraining him. He's still holding the staff

4359
05:07:59,165 --> 05:08:01,751
through part of it, but he's completely unable to
move and is restrained.

4360
05:08:01,751 --> 05:08:03,478
LAURA: But he's holding the staff, still?

4361
05:08:03,478 --> 05:08:04,522
MATT: Yeah.

4362
05:08:04,522 --> 05:08:07,501
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to hit him again.

4363
05:08:07,501 --> 05:08:08,701
MATT: Go for it.

4364
05:08:08,701 --> 05:08:11,001
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Get him!

4365
05:08:11,001 --> 05:08:15,886
LAURA: I can't fucking add! 22?

4366
05:08:15,886 --> 05:08:19,459
MATT: 22 does hit. Roll damage.

4367
05:08:19,459 --> 05:08:22,953
LAURA: I know.

4368
05:08:22,953 --> 05:08:26,052
MATT: 100th episode, guys.

4369
05:08:26,052 --> 05:08:28,020
TRAVIS: It's extravagant.

4370
05:08:28,020 --> 05:08:30,137
SAM: We're onto our bonus material.

4371
05:08:30,137 --> 05:08:34,065
MATT: I know. I want to finish this to a narrative
beat. Sorry. Thanks for coming along, guys.

4372
05:08:34,065 --> 05:08:36,490
LAURA: Do I get sneak attack because he's
restrained?

4373
05:08:36,490 --> 05:08:37,856
MATT: You do.

4374
05:08:37,856 --> 05:08:39,882
LIAM: Advantage, yeah. Yeah, motherfucker.

4375
05:08:39,882 --> 05:08:50,859
LAURA: That was the shittiest additional four. Oh
no. I don't have any idea

4376
05:08:50,859 --> 05:08:52,701
what I rolled before that.

4377
05:08:52,701 --> 05:08:54,703
MATT: Then roll again.

4378
05:08:54,703 --> 05:09:09,199
LAURA: Oh god. I'm so sorry! (counting) This is so
much better than the first roll. 23, and then.

4379
05:09:09,199 --> 05:09:11,436
33.

4380
05:09:11,436 --> 05:09:19,411
MATT: 33. Got it. All right, so (arrow impact) the
other arrow hits. Blood pours out of the mouth as

4381
05:09:19,411 --> 05:09:23,230
they're being held there. They're trying to break
away, but they're not very strong. End of your

4382
05:09:23,230 --> 05:09:25,709
turn? Trinket?

4383
05:09:25,709 --> 05:09:27,185
LAURA: I'm going to get on my broom.

4384
05:09:27,185 --> 05:09:29,536
MATT: Okay, you get on your broom. You going to
move anywhere?

4385
05:09:29,536 --> 05:09:31,124
LAURA: No, but I'm going to be ready to.

4386
05:09:31,124 --> 05:09:33,625
LIAM: (motorcycle revving)

4387
05:09:33,625 --> 05:09:39,941
MATT: All righty, so the necromancer that you just
hit--

4388
05:09:39,941 --> 05:09:44,796
LAURA: I Hunter's Marked him, too, didn't I? I
didn't add my Hunter's Mark on either of those

4389
05:09:44,796 --> 05:09:48,428
attacks. An additional seven for Hunter's Mark.

4390
05:09:48,428 --> 05:10:04,734
MATT: Okay. All righty. He angrily, from beneath
the vines, gets his staff forward and begins

4391
05:10:04,734 --> 05:10:14,163
chanting something under his breath. Rears back
and exhales, and you watch as a cloud of green,

4392
05:10:14,163 --> 05:10:22,980
billowing, poisonous smoke spills out in this
area. That's going to get all of you guys. I want

4393
05:10:22,980 --> 05:10:30,914
Keyleth, Grog, Lionel, and Percy to all make a
constitution saving throw, please.

4394
05:10:30,914 --> 05:10:32,223
TALIESIN: Is it magical?

4395
05:10:32,223 --> 05:10:34,058
MATT: It is magical. It is a Cloudkill spell.

4396
05:10:34,058 --> 05:10:35,843
TRAVIS: It's not poison, though, right?

4397
05:10:35,843 --> 05:10:37,111
MATT: It is poison.

4398
05:10:37,111 --> 05:10:44,604
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil. Ooh, that's not
great. I'm going to go ahead and roll my

4399
05:10:44,604 --> 05:10:48,192
inspiration. That's better.

4400
05:10:48,192 --> 05:10:59,786
MATT: Okay, so you take--

4401
05:10:59,786 --> 05:11:03,486
TRAVIS: I have resistance against poison because
of the Belt of Dwarvenkind.

4402
05:11:03,486 --> 05:11:07,163
MATT: 15 points of poison damage, reduced to
seven.

4403
05:11:07,163 --> 05:11:08,295
TRAVIS: Okay.

4404
05:11:08,295 --> 05:11:09,383
MATT: All right.

4405
05:11:09,383 --> 05:11:11,097
MARISHA: 12.

4406
05:11:11,097 --> 05:11:13,095
MATT: 12. You suffer 30 points of poison damage.

4407
05:11:13,095 --> 05:11:15,309
MARISHA: I'm okay. I'm all right.

4408
05:11:15,309 --> 05:11:16,436
MATT: Lionel?

4409
05:11:16,436 --> 05:11:19,050
MARISHA: How much? 31?

4410
05:11:19,050 --> 05:11:20,294
MATT: 30 points of poison damage.

4411
05:11:20,294 --> 05:11:23,426
JON: 18, but how does off a duck's back work,
again?

4412
05:11:23,426 --> 05:11:26,396
MATT: You use your reaction to reduce the damage
by half.

4413
05:11:26,396 --> 05:11:30,229
JON: Do I have a reaction? Can I do that now?

4414
05:11:30,229 --> 05:11:34,999
MATT: Yes, and you succeed on that, so you
actually reduce it to a quarter, so instead it is

4415
05:11:34,999 --> 05:11:37,262
seven points of poison damage. Percival?

4416
05:11:37,262 --> 05:11:38,609
TALIESIN: I rolled 27.

4417
05:11:38,609 --> 05:11:40,600
MATT: 15 points of poison damage.

4418
05:11:40,600 --> 05:11:43,547
SAM: Off a duck's back? Oh mallard.

4419
05:11:43,547 --> 05:11:49,629
MATT: The cloud remains in this area, so this
whole area is a billowing cloud of bad news.

4420
05:11:49,629 --> 05:11:52,602
LAURA: I assume we didn't hear that terrible pun
from inside the orb of death?

4421
05:11:52,602 --> 05:11:55,266
JON: What was it?

4422
05:11:55,266 --> 05:11:58,650
SAM: I said, oh mal-lard. Oh mallard.

4423
05:11:58,650 --> 05:12:04,444
MATT: Yes, I understand it happens at the start of
their turn, but we're trying to get through this

4424
05:12:04,444 --> 05:12:14,482
quickly, guys. Don't worry. Calming down the
internet. It's fine. Yep. Two skeletons already

4425
05:12:14,482 --> 05:12:16,834
went. That brings us to Pike.

4426
05:12:16,834 --> 05:12:18,845
ASHLEY: Can I do anything?

4427
05:12:18,845 --> 05:12:21,988
MATT: You can move and attack. No spells.

4428
05:12:21,988 --> 05:12:25,254
LAURA: She can attack. Oh, she can't attack.

4429
05:12:25,254 --> 05:12:28,032
LIAM: But we're way in the back.

4430
05:12:28,032 --> 05:12:29,754
SAM: You can't do anything?

4431
05:12:29,754 --> 05:12:33,604
MATT: Not much you can do from this angle,
unfortunately. What do you want to do?

4432
05:12:33,604 --> 05:12:35,372
ASHLEY: There's no rolling against it or
anything?

4433
05:12:35,372 --> 05:12:38,540
MATT: Nope. You get to roll against it in 30
days.

4434
05:12:38,540 --> 05:12:41,750
ASHLEY: Oh, cool. I'll be back in New York.

4435
05:12:41,750 --> 05:12:45,571
TRAVIS: We'll time-jump.

4436
05:12:45,571 --> 05:12:50,233
MARISHA: I can fix it. Just give me a hot second.

4437
05:12:50,233 --> 05:12:51,792
LAURA: What if you die?

4438
05:12:51,792 --> 05:12:53,235
ASHLEY: Yeah, what if you die?

4439
05:12:53,235 --> 05:12:57,045
LIAM: We'll have several problems if Keyleth
dies.

4440
05:12:57,045 --> 05:13:05,057
ASHLEY: Just wander off? I'll start walking back
towards that way.

4441
05:13:05,057 --> 05:13:06,308
MATT: This way?

4442
05:13:06,308 --> 05:13:11,035
ASHLEY: Just start wandering. Yeah.

4443
05:13:11,035 --> 05:13:12,426
MATT: You can dash again.

4444
05:13:12,426 --> 05:13:14,923
ASHLEY: I don't need to dash.

4445
05:13:14,923 --> 05:13:20,162
MATT: Okay. You'll stay back there? We'll say you
get that far. That ends Pike's turn.

4446
05:13:20,162 --> 05:13:21,346
Keyleth, you're up.

4447
05:13:21,346 --> 05:13:23,543
MARISHA: Who's left on the ceiling with me?

4448
05:13:23,543 --> 05:13:27,637
MATT: It's you and Grog and Lionel on the ceiling
with two skeletons.

4449
05:13:27,637 --> 05:13:29,722
MARISHA: Two skeletons? That's it?

4450
05:13:29,722 --> 05:13:31,543
MATT: And one cultist.

4451
05:13:31,543 --> 05:13:33,417
MARISHA: And one fucking cultist?

4452
05:13:33,417 --> 05:13:36,891
JON: He's been pretty hard to kill.

4453
05:13:36,891 --> 05:13:40,241
TALIESIN: I can't help.

4454
05:13:40,241 --> 05:13:55,146
MARISHA: Oh my god. A lot of things have changed
in a hot second. Okay. What's going on right now?

4455
05:13:55,146 --> 05:13:57,283
TALIESIN: I can't help. I'm not allowed to help.

4456
05:13:57,283 --> 05:14:01,069
MARISHA: Where's Delilah?

4457
05:14:01,069 --> 05:14:03,877
LAURA: She's hiding in the ball. We can't get to
her.

4458
05:14:03,877 --> 05:14:06,730
TRAVIS: Smoke everybody outside that bitch.

4459
05:14:06,730 --> 05:14:20,037
MARISHA: I mean, why not? Go big or go home. I'm
going to burn my 9th-level Shapechange and go...

4460
05:14:20,037 --> 05:14:25,507
I'm going to go red dragon?

4461
05:14:25,507 --> 05:14:27,454
MATT: Okay.

4462
05:14:27,454 --> 05:14:30,764
MARISHA: And that's all I can do, right?

4463
05:14:30,764 --> 05:14:32,307
MATT: Yep. That is your action.

4464
05:14:32,307 --> 05:14:36,023
MARISHA: I'm a dragon on the ceiling.

4465
05:14:36,023 --> 05:14:40,989
MATT: You can still move if you want to, but you
are a dragon on the ceiling.

4466
05:14:40,989 --> 05:14:42,969
JON: Cool.

4467
05:14:42,969 --> 05:14:47,506
LIAM: Do you have a giant crate of the things she
can turn into?

4468
05:14:47,506 --> 05:14:53,170
MARISHA: He does. He had to pack a lot of stuff
because of me. I feel mildly guilty.

4469
05:14:53,170 --> 05:14:54,893
MATT: That's fine. What are you doing, Keyleth?

4470
05:14:54,893 --> 05:15:02,811
MARISHA: Can I move, (impacts) giant dragon
walking on the ceiling, and then look down at

4471
05:15:02,811 --> 05:15:07,279
Delilah backwards and upside down and say, hello!

4472
05:15:07,279 --> 05:15:16,768
MATT: You get two attacks of opportunity from the
two skeletons as you step over. 18 and 21.

4473
05:15:16,768 --> 05:15:18,777
MARISHA: No, yes.

4474
05:15:18,777 --> 05:15:25,905
MATT: Take 11 points of slashing damage. Do you
have damage resistance in your dragon form?

4475
05:15:25,905 --> 05:15:27,754
MARISHA: Yeah, I do.

4476
05:15:27,754 --> 05:15:32,600
MATT: You move over and you look down. It's an
orb, it's not a cylinder, so you just see the

4477
05:15:32,600 --> 05:15:37,077
giant red dome. You can't see her because it's a
dome.

4478
05:15:37,077 --> 05:15:38,942
MARISHA: I can't see her.

4479
05:15:38,942 --> 05:15:43,703
MATT: Nope. So, you get up and you glance down.
For the purposes of this, you are currently right

4480
05:15:43,703 --> 05:15:54,934
there and it's just a big red dome. There, it's
fine. Reverse Gravity makes this battlefield so

4481
05:15:54,934 --> 05:15:56,623
easy to keep track of.

4482
05:15:56,623 --> 05:15:58,068
LIAM: Sorry, Matt!

4483
05:15:58,068 --> 05:16:06,440
MATT: It's fine. All right, Keyleth, is that your
go? It was an action to cast it and your move.

4484
05:16:06,440 --> 05:16:11,287
MARISHA: I have Frightful Presence for anyone who
might be terrified of me. That's it.

4485
05:16:11,287 --> 05:16:19,629
MATT: Nobody sees you right now through the
sphere. That ends your turn. All right. Delilah,

4486
05:16:19,629 --> 05:16:29,828
within the sphere, the cultists next to her end up
throwing the last object up and they-- well, no,

4487
05:16:29,828 --> 05:16:34,020
sorry, they have not been throwing it in there
because when the sphere turned, they'd been

4488
05:16:34,030 --> 05:16:42,311
holding in there waiting for a moment. Delilah
glances out and sees the dragon up there, she gets

4489
05:16:42,378 --> 05:16:46,997
to make her save against your Frightful Presence.
That is a 21 wisdom.

4490
05:16:47,067 --> 05:16:48,493
MARISHA: What's that against?

4491
05:16:48,493 --> 05:16:51,076
MATT: The DC of whatever your Frightful Presence
is.

4492
05:16:51,076 --> 05:16:55,518
MARISHA: 19. Versus wisdom save.

4493
05:16:55,518 --> 05:17:01,493
MATT: Wisdom saves, yeah, she makes it. She looks
out, seeing everyone falling apart out there,

4494
05:17:01,493 --> 05:17:12,439
pulls back in, looks at Scanlan and goes, "There's
more important things to do." She grabs her amulet

4495
05:17:12,439 --> 05:17:19,769
that she has around her neck and as she holds it
again, you watch as the white orb that was glowing

4496
05:17:19,769 --> 05:17:37,644
turns to black once again. In that instant, Grog,
you revert back to your regular size, Keyleth, you

4497
05:17:37,644 --> 05:17:48,768
return to your form, Percy, you fall off the side
of the wall and land on your feet barely. The

4498
05:17:48,768 --> 05:17:58,156
skeletons just collapse into piles of bones. Tary,
you fall and land on the ground there. This

4499
05:17:58,156 --> 05:18:01,141
Prismatic Wall vanishes.

4500
05:18:01,141 --> 05:18:06,471
SAM: Does Feeblemind end?

4501
05:18:06,471 --> 05:18:15,789
MATT: Feeblemind, currently, right now, is not
affecting you. Meaning, Feeblemind, whatever the

4502
05:18:15,789 --> 05:18:20,724
spell is right now, doesn't seem to be having an
effect. All of a sudden, your consciousness comes

4503
05:18:20,724 --> 05:18:22,138
back to you.

4504
05:18:22,138 --> 05:18:23,907
ASHLEY: Really?!

4505
05:18:23,907 --> 05:18:25,289
MATT: Uh-huh.

4506
05:18:25,289 --> 05:18:27,211
ASHLEY: Oh, fucking hell!

4507
05:18:27,211 --> 05:18:34,385
MATT: She, clutching the amulet, gives a nod to
the two other cultists and all three of them step

4508
05:18:34,385 --> 05:18:40,830
into the black orb. You watch as their forms
(whooshing noises) and vanish.

4509
05:18:40,830 --> 05:18:42,473
TRAVIS: They disapparated.

4510
05:18:42,473 --> 05:18:45,903
ASHLEY: They stepped into the circle?

4511
05:18:45,903 --> 05:18:47,088
MATT: Yep!

4512
05:18:47,088 --> 05:18:50,569
LAURA: The orb, they went into the orb!

4513
05:18:50,569 --> 05:18:56,361
TRAVIS: They're moving freely and it looked like
pretty familiarly--

4514
05:18:56,361 --> 05:18:58,050
MATT: Through the sphere.

4515
05:18:58,050 --> 05:19:05,034
MARISHA: They went into the thing! They're gone
forever!

4516
05:19:05,034 --> 05:19:06,296
TALIESIN: No!

4517
05:19:06,296 --> 05:19:08,035
TRAVIS: And they've done it before.

4518
05:19:08,035 --> 05:19:10,232
LAURA: That's how they got over here!

4519
05:19:10,232 --> 05:19:12,239
MATT: Scanlan, I want you to roll a perception
check.

4520
05:19:12,239 --> 05:19:20,089
SAM: Not great. Five.

4521
05:19:20,089 --> 05:19:21,640
MATT: Okay. Never mind.

4522
05:19:21,640 --> 05:19:27,821
MARISHA: If she went in the tiny thing.

4523
05:19:27,821 --> 05:19:29,157
MATT: Yep!

4524
05:19:29,157 --> 05:19:35,420
MARISHA: I still have Shapechange for another
hour.

4525
05:19:35,420 --> 05:19:37,183
SAM: No, it's gone, you're done.

4526
05:19:37,183 --> 05:19:42,430
MARISHA: Wait, did she cancel my spell, or is it
just the orb that's done?

4527
05:19:42,430 --> 05:19:46,329
MATT: You sense the concentration is still there,
but the spell has no effect where you currently

4528
05:19:46,329 --> 05:19:55,209
are. By the way, Lionel and Grog, you both
(falling sounds) slamming into the ground.

4529
05:19:55,209 --> 05:19:56,486
TRAVIS: Dexterity?

4530
05:19:56,486 --> 05:20:05,521
MATT: Nope! You guys suffer 15 points of
bludgeoning damage. So, reduced to half for both

4531
05:20:05,521 --> 05:20:08,413
of you because you're raging, so seven bludgeoning
damage each.

4532
05:20:08,501 --> 05:20:10,407
LIAM: And are the wings schlorped back in?

4533
05:20:10,407 --> 05:20:11,938
MATT: Yes. Your wings (retracting sound).

4534
05:20:11,938 --> 05:20:14,947
JON: Mine says "while raging, resist bludgeoning
damage."

4535
05:20:14,947 --> 05:20:16,499
MATT: That's what I'm saying, you're taking half
damage from this.

4536
05:20:16,499 --> 05:20:17,930
You take seven, as opposed to 15.

4537
05:20:17,930 --> 05:20:20,551
SAM: Am I still there?

4538
05:20:20,551 --> 05:20:22,521
MATT: You're still there, right next to the orb.

4539
05:20:22,521 --> 05:20:31,290
TALIESIN: I am going to unload a couple shots into
the orb and see what happens.

4540
05:20:31,290 --> 05:20:35,509
MATT: Okay, go ahead and take a shot.

4541
05:20:35,509 --> 05:20:45,129
TALIESIN: Animus freezes up, I throw it. Pull Bad
News. Bad News freezes up.

4542
05:20:45,129 --> 05:20:48,178
I pull Retort. That hits.

4543
05:20:48,178 --> 05:20:59,607
MATT: Technically, fire, discard, quick draw,
right? Quick draw means you can do it as a free

4544
05:20:59,607 --> 05:21:00,838
action as a part of it?

4545
05:21:00,838 --> 05:21:03,878
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll burn an action surge for
this.

4546
05:21:03,878 --> 05:21:08,822
MATT: We'll say because you only used your bonus
action to-- oh, not to reload. As a quick draw,

4547
05:21:08,822 --> 05:21:13,008
you can pull it as an attack, you're fine. So, you
do three attacks, the third one fires. You fire

4548
05:21:13,008 --> 05:21:15,263
(bullet) and it vanishes into the orb.

4549
05:21:15,263 --> 05:21:20,115
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit and fix my guns.

4550
05:21:20,115 --> 05:21:22,160
TRAVIS: Are there any enemies left on the map?

4551
05:21:22,160 --> 05:21:26,197
MATT: Currently, there's the one right there who's
being held by the brambles. The brambles have

4552
05:21:26,197 --> 05:21:33,071
vanished, and he's currently still conscious, and
it's not his turn yet. So, Percy took all the

4553
05:21:33,071 --> 05:21:36,218
shots into the orb. It is now Scanlan's turn.

4554
05:21:36,218 --> 05:21:46,709
SAM: I will draw my blade and scream and hit that
thing with my sword. No, the guy!

4555
05:21:46,709 --> 05:21:48,351
The guy, not the orb.

4556
05:21:48,351 --> 05:21:54,754
MATT: You rush towards the guy as the brambles
wither away and fall to the ground. He turns

4557
05:21:54,754 --> 05:22:00,572
around to rush towards the orb just as you rush
towards him. Your bardic battle cry just "Argh!"

4558
05:22:00,572 --> 05:22:03,053
with Mythcarver. Go ahead and make your attack.

4559
05:22:03,053 --> 05:22:08,764
SAM: Jon's dice. 11 plus I think it's ten.
Somewhere.

4560
05:22:08,764 --> 05:22:11,565
MATT: That'll hit. His armor class isn't very
high; it's just a mage armor of 15.

4561
05:22:11,565 --> 05:22:13,109
LAURA: Yay!

4562
05:22:13,109 --> 05:22:19,512
SAM: It's just a sword; it's not even magical now.
Shit, I can't find anything,

4563
05:22:19,512 --> 05:22:21,105
I think it's 1d8 plus two.

4564
05:22:21,105 --> 05:22:22,512
MATT: It's 1d8 plus your strength.

4565
05:22:22,512 --> 05:22:24,875
SAM: 1d8 plus three. Right?

4566
05:22:24,875 --> 05:22:29,546
MATT: Well, it doesn't have a magical bonus right
now. So just 1d8 plus your strength modifier.

4567
05:22:29,546 --> 05:22:30,916
What's your strength modifier?

4568
05:22:30,916 --> 05:22:36,438
SAM: I can't even find it. I think it's one, but
this is an old sheet.

4569
05:22:36,438 --> 05:22:38,266
MATT: So, 1d8 plus one, your strength hasn't gone
up.

4570
05:22:38,266 --> 05:22:43,699
SAM: Thank you. Seven.

4571
05:22:43,699 --> 05:22:45,278
MATT: Seven damage.

4572
05:22:45,278 --> 05:22:46,967
SAM: Plus one. So eight damage.

4573
05:22:46,967 --> 05:22:49,315
MATT: Eight damage. How do you want to do this,
Scanlan?

4574
05:22:49,315 --> 05:22:52,938
LAURA: The most lackluster how do you want to do
this!

4575
05:22:52,938 --> 05:22:55,333
MATT: He had, like, three hit points left. How do
you want to do this?

4576
05:22:55,333 --> 05:23:06,269
SAM: I'll just stab him in his toes over and over
and I'll say, this is what you get for separating

4577
05:23:06,269 --> 05:23:12,147
me from my friends! Who I want to be around
forever because I love them! Is this what we're

4578
05:23:12,147 --> 05:23:13,759
supposed to do now, is this the thing?

4579
05:23:13,759 --> 05:23:14,913
TRAVIS: Don't question it.

4580
05:23:14,913 --> 05:23:16,480
SAM: Okay. Yeah, my friends!

4581
05:23:16,480 --> 05:23:20,751
MATT: As you repeatedly stab it in the feet, he's
like, "Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!" and it's like trying

4582
05:23:20,751 --> 05:23:25,595
to pull away from you down the side of the pyramid
ziggurat. "What are you doing?!" as you keep

4583
05:23:25,595 --> 05:23:31,815
stabbing it over and over again into the feet
until it falls unconscious. Bleeding out through

4584
05:23:31,815 --> 05:23:34,852
his ankles. How very Scanlan.

4585
05:23:34,852 --> 05:23:38,518
TRAVIS: Through his ankles.

4586
05:23:38,518 --> 05:23:40,781
LAURA: (laughing) That is the stupidest death!

4587
05:23:40,781 --> 05:23:43,734
TRAVIS: All right, we're going in the little
sphere. Here we go.

4588
05:23:43,734 --> 05:23:44,766
LAURA: No!

4589
05:23:44,766 --> 05:23:47,991
MARISHA: So, what? What?

4590
05:23:47,991 --> 05:23:49,782
TRAVIS: No, no, no.

4591
05:23:49,782 --> 05:23:56,248
MARISHA: So it's only a dark magical, anti-magical
field because she <i>wants</i> it to be?!

4592
05:23:56,248 --> 05:23:57,683
TRAVIS: She manipulated it.

4593
05:23:57,683 --> 05:23:59,114
LAURA: She turned it into that.

4594
05:23:59,114 --> 05:24:00,103
MARISHA: Which means--

4595
05:24:00,103 --> 05:24:03,000
LAURA: She succeeded on the previous one. This a
pathway into some other world now.

4596
05:24:03,000 --> 05:24:04,807
MARISHA: She can change it!

4597
05:24:04,807 --> 05:24:11,031
JON: She did something. It was black before, then
she turned it white, and I don't know if that

4598
05:24:11,031 --> 05:24:15,898
allowed magic. But when she turned it black
again, all magic stops, so.

4599
05:24:15,898 --> 05:24:17,979
TRAVIS: Which is like the one that we've been
around.

4600
05:24:17,979 --> 05:24:19,886
LIAM: I mean, she knows what she's doing.

4601
05:24:19,886 --> 05:24:23,165
TRAVIS: Who has Speak with Dead?

4602
05:24:23,165 --> 05:24:25,718
LAURA: We can't do anything in here.

4603
05:24:25,718 --> 05:24:29,397
TALIESIN: We're going to drag this cadaver
outside.

4604
05:24:29,397 --> 05:24:31,090
LAURA: Okay, let's take the cadaver outside.

4605
05:24:31,090 --> 05:24:36,313
MARISHA: So, it's just very strong magic which
makes her change what it is?

4606
05:24:36,313 --> 05:24:41,815
LIAM: She knows how it works. We don't know why
she's here, but she

4607
05:24:41,815 --> 05:24:43,758
figured shit out the last time.

4608
05:24:43,758 --> 05:24:49,030
LAURA: We fucking killed her. How did we kill her
before? How did she die?

4609
05:24:49,030 --> 05:24:53,743
MATT: You killed her in the hallway as she was
trying to escape back to Castle Whitestone when you

4610
05:24:53,743 --> 05:24:55,029
were fighting Orthax.

4611
05:24:55,029 --> 05:24:56,498
LAURA: Like, she fully fucking died.

4612
05:24:56,498 --> 05:24:58,364
MATT: You killed her and threw her body in the
acid pit.

4613
05:24:58,364 --> 05:25:00,545
LAURA: Holy shit.

4614
05:25:00,545 --> 05:25:01,658
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4615
05:25:01,658 --> 05:25:03,603
TRAVIS: Not a lot of remains to be, you know.

4616
05:25:03,603 --> 05:25:05,110
TALIESIN: Resurrected.

4617
05:25:05,182 --> 05:25:07,157
MARISHA: All of their magic was necromantic.

4618
05:25:07,157 --> 05:25:11,488
SAM: What if it's just her soul or something?

4619
05:25:11,488 --> 05:25:13,463
LAURA: What if it's not really her?

4620
05:25:13,463 --> 05:25:16,915
TRAVIS: Well, listen, we're not going in the orb,
right?

4621
05:25:16,915 --> 05:25:17,861
TALIESIN: No.

4622
05:25:17,861 --> 05:25:21,314
TRAVIS: Yeah, so let's drag one of these
smart-looking fucks outside and have Pike do

4623
05:25:21,314 --> 05:25:22,515
Twenty Questions.

4624
05:25:22,515 --> 05:25:26,101
SAM: I'm a little worried that once we walk
outside, Pike becomes dumb again.

4625
05:25:26,101 --> 05:25:31,453
LAURA: Well, she can Greater Restoration her as
soon as we walk outside.

4626
05:25:31,453 --> 05:25:32,694
MARISHA: I can.

4627
05:25:32,694 --> 05:25:37,337
TALIESIN: Let's take this outside. Just take it
outside. Nothing good happens here.

4628
05:25:37,337 --> 05:25:46,880
MARISHA: Wait, before we go. Pike, does Sarenrae
know anything about this? Anything?

4629
05:25:46,880 --> 05:25:50,364
ASHLEY: I can check.

4630
05:25:50,364 --> 05:25:51,944
TRAVIS: Sam, I think you're right.

4631
05:25:51,944 --> 05:25:54,107
TALIESIN: You're just going to waste your attempt
in here.

4632
05:25:54,107 --> 05:25:56,310
JON: There might be some ducks.

4633
05:25:56,310 --> 05:26:00,313
MATT: Are you going to try to have a brief
communion with Sarenrae in the temple?

4634
05:26:00,313 --> 05:26:02,244
LAURA: I mean, you could try.

4635
05:26:02,244 --> 05:26:05,906
LIAM: If you lose your brain, you can't do it, so
why not?

4636
05:26:05,906 --> 05:26:07,268
ASHLEY: I'll try.

4637
05:26:07,268 --> 05:26:14,250
MATT: You drop to your knees for a moment and
concentrate, hoping for her wisdom. Go ahead and

4638
05:26:14,250 --> 05:26:17,888
make a general wisdom check. Roll a d20 and add
your wisdom modifier. Plus five.

4639
05:26:17,888 --> 05:26:19,106
ASHLEY: Wisdom modifier?

4640
05:26:19,106 --> 05:26:21,288
MATT: Yeah, I believe it's plus five.

4641
05:26:21,288 --> 05:26:26,059
ASHLEY: Okay. 22.

4642
05:26:26,059 --> 05:26:32,805
MATT: 22. As you concentrate, you feel the warmth
of Sarenrae's embrace descend from the darkness of

4643
05:26:32,805 --> 05:26:39,999
the inside of your eyelids. You see the angelic
form of her flaming aura come down and her hands

4644
05:26:39,999 --> 05:26:47,455
touch the sides of your cheek. She turns your head
around towards the orb. And, where previously you

4645
05:26:47,455 --> 05:26:57,252
saw the little black dot, instead, you see a large
oval doorway. Around it, it is flickering madly

4646
05:26:57,252 --> 05:27:03,757
like a hundred spinning razors around the edges,
but just beyond it you can see what appears to be

4647
05:27:03,757 --> 05:27:12,450
a desolate, gray landscape, what looks to be a
scattering of city buildings across this broken,

4648
05:27:12,450 --> 05:27:20,650
black shadowland, and in the center a singular
black obsidian tower that rises up to where you

4649
05:27:20,650 --> 05:27:26,631
can't quite see the top from your current angle.
And she gets down really close to the side of your

4650
05:27:26,631 --> 05:27:35,151
ear. You feel the warmth of her divine breath
against your face. She says, "This is the destiny.

4651
05:27:35,151 --> 05:27:42,781
"This needs to stop. Only terror will come through
this."

4652
05:27:42,781 --> 05:27:48,385
ASHLEY: We have to go there?

4653
05:27:48,385 --> 05:27:54,558
MATT: "Whatever way you can. Our reach cannot go
beyond the Divine Gate."

4654
05:27:54,558 --> 05:28:01,344
ASHLEY: If I go there, will you not be able to go
with me?

4655
05:28:01,344 --> 05:28:05,430
MATT: "I will be diminished, if at all able to."

4656
05:28:05,430 --> 05:28:14,800
ASHLEY: Okay. Thank you.

4657
05:28:14,800 --> 05:28:20,040
MATT: And her finger touches your head and she
kisses the top of your forehead and you feel the

4658
05:28:20,040 --> 05:28:27,229
warm presence again, and she withdraws. As she
withdraws, the cold is even harder with her

4659
05:28:27,229 --> 05:28:33,734
absence because now the proximity of that shadow,
of this room, just this general sense of negative

4660
05:28:33,734 --> 05:28:39,241
energy and death that emanates from this direction
behind you. As soon as you watch her light vanish

4661
05:28:39,241 --> 05:28:42,411
and you open your eyes again, you're chilled to
the bone.

4662
05:28:42,411 --> 05:29:02,299
ASHLEY: Okay. Well, it's a doorway, and we have to
go there. It's the only way to stop this.

4663
05:29:02,299 --> 05:29:04,281
LAURA: Stop what?

4664
05:29:04,281 --> 05:29:08,482
ASHLEY: I don't know.

4665
05:29:08,482 --> 05:29:14,838
LAURA: Well, we can't go through now.

4666
05:29:14,838 --> 05:29:19,546
TALIESIN: Can't we?

4667
05:29:19,546 --> 05:29:28,709
MARISHA: Is it just like this now? Like the
ziggurat in Whitestone?

4668
05:29:28,709 --> 05:29:34,269
TALIESIN: I don't know. Can't we?

4669
05:29:34,269 --> 05:29:36,280
TRAVIS: Yeah, we can.

4670
05:29:36,280 --> 05:29:42,423
LAURA: Oh, fuck. But, we're not even healed. They
just went through. We're going to go through and

4671
05:29:42,423 --> 05:29:44,127
just die immediately.

4672
05:29:44,127 --> 05:29:49,342
SAM: We have to go at least find out if the spells
are still affecting us.

4673
05:29:49,342 --> 05:29:51,940
If we go through and Pike's dumb--

4674
05:29:51,940 --> 05:29:53,718
ASHLEY: Maybe we should back out.

4675
05:29:53,718 --> 05:30:02,664
MARISHA: The last time I put my hand in the sphere
when it was black it nearly tore me apart. We

4676
05:30:02,664 --> 05:30:04,212
could try again.

4677
05:30:04,212 --> 05:30:06,107
LAURA: It was just a doorway?

4678
05:30:06,107 --> 05:30:13,673
ASHLEY: It was a doorway, and it opened into a
city of sorts and in the middle

4679
05:30:13,673 --> 05:30:16,179
was an obsidian tower.

4680
05:30:16,179 --> 05:30:17,995
LAURA: That's what I saw through the other one!

4681
05:30:17,995 --> 05:30:19,338
ASHLEY: Okay.

4682
05:30:19,338 --> 05:30:22,036
LIAM: Do I feel anything? Sense anything?

4683
05:30:22,036 --> 05:30:24,519
MATT: In what way?

4684
05:30:24,519 --> 05:30:26,665
LIAM: From my patron.

4685
05:30:26,665 --> 05:30:28,600
MATT: Do you wish to try to concentrate there?

4686
05:30:28,600 --> 05:30:29,725
LIAM: Yeah.

4687
05:30:29,725 --> 05:30:33,702
MATT: Make a wisdom check. d20, add your wisdom
modifier.

4688
05:30:33,702 --> 05:30:45,625
LIAM: Use my last Luck of the day. Same thing.
It's shit. Seven.

4689
05:30:45,625 --> 05:30:53,709
MATT: Seven? You concentrate and you get the sense
that the proximity of this orb and something about

4690
05:30:53,709 --> 05:31:06,603
the nature of this whole occurrence is interfering
with your connection with your deity temporarily.

4691
05:31:06,603 --> 05:31:09,857
You try and reach out to her, but nothing is
returning your call.

4692
05:31:09,857 --> 05:31:17,545
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's step out of the range, see
what happens.

4693
05:31:17,545 --> 05:31:23,525
LAURA: Can we back out and see how far the range
goes? Is it the same distance as our ziggurat?

4694
05:31:23,525 --> 05:31:26,566
MATT: So, you drag a body, you said?

4695
05:31:26,566 --> 05:31:28,535
LAURA: Yeah, one of the bodies.

4696
05:31:28,535 --> 05:31:29,983
TRAVIS: Which one, the dark paladin?

4697
05:31:29,983 --> 05:31:31,826
LIAM: Yeah, that asshole.

4698
05:31:31,826 --> 05:31:41,269
MATT: So, you take the black guard, drag it behind
you. The rest of you all continue down the

4699
05:31:41,269 --> 05:31:50,271
pathway. You get to about where that
T-intersection was and Pike,

4700
05:31:50,271 --> 05:31:51,988
your brain goes numb once more.

4701
05:31:51,988 --> 05:31:54,122
ASHLEY: (laughing) No!

4702
05:31:54,122 --> 05:32:01,256
MARISHA: Keyleth goes over to Pike and puts her
palm on her head and casts Greater Restoration.

4703
05:32:01,256 --> 05:32:08,009
MATT: The spell immediately loses its hold and you
regain control of your facilities.

4704
05:32:08,009 --> 05:32:16,639
ASHLEY: Disaster averted, Keyleth. I throw my arms
around her and I kiss her on the forehead,

4705
05:32:16,639 --> 05:32:17,768
on the cheek.

4706
05:32:17,768 --> 05:32:19,634
LAURA: Just full on her lips.

4707
05:32:19,634 --> 05:32:21,420
ASHLEY: Sorry, I'm just so intense.

4708
05:32:21,420 --> 05:32:25,369
MARISHA: The amount you've saved us. It's nothing.
I've learned it from you.

4709
05:32:25,369 --> 05:32:29,051
ASHLEY: Okay, do we need to talk to this dead
person?

4710
05:32:29,051 --> 05:32:30,118
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4711
05:32:30,118 --> 05:32:31,284
MARISHA: No.

4712
05:32:31,284 --> 05:32:33,782
TRAVIS: What? We don't need to talk to this dead
person?

4713
05:32:33,782 --> 05:32:36,607
MARISHA: Sorry, I was answering a different
question. Continue.

4714
05:32:36,607 --> 05:32:37,918
TRAVIS: Do it.

4715
05:32:37,918 --> 05:32:40,454
ASHLEY: I'll cast Speak with Dead.

4716
05:32:40,454 --> 05:32:46,217
MATT: Speak with Dead. You watch the plate armor
rouse ever so slightly as the fresh corpse begins

4717
05:32:46,217 --> 05:32:53,124
to clink and tense against the metal plates. You
hear the creaking sound of breath trying to escape

4718
05:32:53,124 --> 05:32:57,856
from the reedy thin slit where, apparently, part
of the dagger blow that you had shoved in the back

4719
05:32:57,856 --> 05:33:00,518
of its neck went through and cut part of the vocal
cards.

4720
05:33:00,518 --> 05:33:02,324
LAURA: Eww! Fucking gross!

4721
05:33:02,324 --> 05:33:05,283
MATT: You have its attention.

4722
05:33:05,283 --> 05:33:10,822
ASHLEY: Is this one of the ones where his eye is
missing, is he one of those guys?

4723
05:33:10,822 --> 05:33:15,039
MATT: As you glance closer to the black guard,
because the helmet's still on, you'd have to pull

4724
05:33:15,039 --> 05:33:16,362
the helmet off.

4725
05:33:16,362 --> 05:33:19,866
ASHLEY: He's the guy with the-- yeah. Pull it off
for sure.

4726
05:33:19,866 --> 05:33:21,949
MATT: Pull the helmet off-- it's missing its eye.

4727
05:33:21,949 --> 05:33:26,051
SAM: By the way, while this is going on, I'm
dragging Doty out.

4728
05:33:26,051 --> 05:33:28,020
MATT: Okay. (creaking)

4729
05:33:28,020 --> 05:33:31,960
LAURA: I help. Trinket helps, too, because he's
stronger.

4730
05:33:31,960 --> 05:33:35,521
ASHLEY: Okay, what do we want to know?

4731
05:33:35,521 --> 05:33:38,665
MATT: Five questions.

4732
05:33:38,665 --> 05:33:40,209
ASHLEY: Why an eye is missing?

4733
05:33:40,209 --> 05:33:42,773
TRAVIS: How they access the gate.

4734
05:33:42,773 --> 05:33:44,458
TALIESIN: What is it?

4735
05:33:44,458 --> 05:33:48,051
LIAM: You've got five?

4736
05:33:48,051 --> 05:33:49,190
ASHLEY: Five.

4737
05:33:49,190 --> 05:33:51,851
LIAM: Is the gate safe for us to travel?

4738
05:33:51,851 --> 05:34:17,835
ASHLEY: Who do you work for? Okay. Is it safe for
any of us to get through the gate?

4739
05:34:17,835 --> 05:34:29,331
MATT: You can see the lips are curled back against
the teeth and the skin is stretched tight against

4740
05:34:29,331 --> 05:34:37,663
the skull. While once living, this had some sort
of necrotic twisting to its flesh, whether it be

4741
05:34:37,663 --> 05:34:43,702
by proximity or practice. But the jaws open.
(gasping) Through the jaw doesn't move, you hear

4742
05:34:43,702 --> 05:34:58,415
the escaping thin air forming words that say, "You
need one of the crafted stones to pass unharmed."

4743
05:34:58,415 --> 05:35:02,172
LAURA: Or the blade, the sphere!

4744
05:35:02,172 --> 05:35:12,450
MATT: (gasping) "Or be hearty enough to survive
its ravishing doorway."

4745
05:35:12,450 --> 05:35:22,010
ASHLEY: Who do you serve?

4746
05:35:22,010 --> 05:35:33,819
MATT: "We are the Remnants. Small parts of the
whole, given purpose to come together and remake

4747
05:35:33,819 --> 05:35:36,568
"the vessel of the Undying King."

4748
05:35:36,568 --> 05:35:45,490
ASHLEY: Why do you have one eye missing?

4749
05:35:45,490 --> 05:35:55,018
MATT: "To bequeath ourselves of the highest
Remnant order to the Whispered One is to gift our

4750
05:35:55,018 --> 05:36:01,428
"sight like he did. Be granted knowledge he
keeps."

4751
05:36:01,428 --> 05:36:04,920
LAURA: There's only two more questions left.

4752
05:36:04,920 --> 05:36:10,765
LIAM: Suggestion. How did Ripley return--

4753
05:36:10,765 --> 05:36:12,141
LAURA: Not Ripley. Delilah.

4754
05:36:12,141 --> 05:36:13,723
LIAM: That's what I meant to say. Delilah.

4755
05:36:13,723 --> 05:36:14,676
ASHLEY: Was that Delilah?

4756
05:36:14,676 --> 05:36:15,865
LAURA and LIAM: Yeah.

4757
05:36:15,865 --> 05:36:18,161
LIAM: How did Delilah return?

4758
05:36:18,161 --> 05:36:23,159
ASHLEY: I have one job!

4759
05:36:23,159 --> 05:36:25,043
LAURA: It's stupid!

4760
05:36:25,043 --> 05:36:27,164
ASHLEY: How did Delilah return?

4761
05:36:27,164 --> 05:36:38,186
MATT: "I know not the means. But she is a powerful
necromancer, and with the right preparation, even

4762
05:36:38,186 --> 05:36:40,689
"death can be averted."

4763
05:36:40,689 --> 05:36:46,128
ASHLEY: What did you say?

4764
05:36:46,128 --> 05:37:02,843
LAURA: Or, do they have plans to attack through
the orbs? Or how many orbs are there on this plane?

4765
05:37:02,843 --> 05:37:10,106
LIAM: He didn't know the answer to the last one.
So he might not know the answer.

4766
05:37:10,106 --> 05:37:16,752
LAURA: Yeah, are there plans to come through the
orbs?

4767
05:37:16,752 --> 05:37:20,513
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's a great one.

4768
05:37:20,513 --> 05:37:24,534
LIAM: Is there anything that Delilah is afraid
of?

4769
05:37:24,534 --> 05:37:26,836
LAURA: Nah, he wouldn't know that.

4770
05:37:26,836 --> 05:37:35,725
ASHLEY: What are your plans? What are The
Remnants' plans?

4771
05:37:35,725 --> 05:37:47,204
MATT: The whisper becomes a slight chuckle.
(chuckling) "His return is nigh. The Whispered One

4772
05:37:47,204 --> 05:37:58,031
"will come. His acolytes will help him complete his
destiny through the Ritual of Seeding. From within

4773
05:37:58,031 --> 05:38:08,343
"the gate he will rise, the solitary tyrant and
lord of Exandria. And with the sole crown of

4774
05:38:08,343 --> 05:38:19,046
"creation guarded upon his head, we who were his
body will be rewarded with life eternal at his side."

4775
05:38:19,046 --> 05:38:23,312
(gasping) And the spell fades.

4776
05:38:23,312 --> 05:38:26,153
TALIESIN: Did he not have one more?

4777
05:38:26,153 --> 05:38:27,743
MATT: That was five questions.

4778
05:38:27,743 --> 05:38:30,973
LAURA: Great.

4779
05:38:30,973 --> 05:38:38,927
MATT: As you sit here in the cavern, contemplating
what these words mean, what the next step of your

4780
05:38:38,927 --> 05:38:46,994
accelerated involvement in this plot, we're going
to end tonight's episode. Ran a little over, guys;

4781
05:38:46,994 --> 05:38:49,247
hundredth episode, that's a record.

4782
05:38:49,247 --> 05:38:54,068
MARISHA: What time is it? 12:41! Oh my god!

4783
05:38:54,068 --> 05:38:56,175
LIAM: 12:41?!

4784
05:38:56,175 --> 05:38:58,022
LAURA: Is that the longest we've ever gone?

4785
05:38:58,022 --> 05:39:04,029
MATT: Holy shit. For those who are still here,
hanging out, thank you for staying! For those who

4786
05:39:04,029 --> 05:39:05,735
aren't, enjoy your two-parter!

4787
05:39:05,735 --> 05:39:10,755
MARISHA: A lot to unpack, there.

4788
05:39:10,755 --> 05:39:12,672
TALIESIN: Tune in next week for a shopping
episode.

4789
05:39:12,672 --> 05:39:14,423
LAURA: Yeah, for sure.

4790
05:39:14,423 --> 05:39:16,252
TALIESIN: Critical Role goes to the beach.

4791
05:39:16,252 --> 05:39:18,803
LIAM: Scanlan, Taryon. Wow.

4792
05:39:18,803 --> 05:39:20,102
TALIESIN: Doty.

4793
05:39:20,102 --> 05:39:22,612
MARISHA: The eight characters on this side of the
table.

4794
05:39:22,612 --> 05:39:26,679
MATT: Yeah, seriously. Dude, thank you again, Jon,
for joining us!

4795
05:39:26,679 --> 05:39:30,777
(cheering)

4796
05:39:30,777 --> 05:39:33,961
MATT: Thank you guys so much for watching. Thank
you for being part of our hundredth episode.

4797
05:39:33,961 --> 05:39:36,799
LAURA: Thank you, Marvel Puzzle Quest!

4798
05:39:36,799 --> 05:39:40,930
MATT: Thank you, Marvel Puzzle Quest for being our
amazing sponsor. Thank you, Critters, for being

4799
05:39:40,930 --> 05:39:45,804
amazing. I'm going to get my, like, four hours of
sleep before getting on a plane to a convention.

4800
05:39:45,804 --> 05:39:48,689
So I'll see you guys in Texas!

4801
05:39:48,689 --> 05:39:51,246
LIAM: Real soon.

4802
05:39:51,246 --> 05:39:58,898
MATT: Yep. Anyway, love you all. Have a wonderful
night, and is it Thursday yet? Good night!

4803
