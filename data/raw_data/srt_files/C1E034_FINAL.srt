1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,245
MATT: And welcome to tonight's fantastical episode
of Critical Role.

2
00:00:03,245 --> 00:00:04,493
ZAC: Fantastical?

3
00:00:04,493 --> 00:00:05,433
MATT: Fantastical.

4
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:06,337
ZAC: Testicular.

5
00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:11,025
MATT: It is. It is a testicle episode of Critical
Role. Sorry for the delay. We had some technical

6
00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:16,766
issues as tonight we do have the wondrous Ashley
Johnson joining us via Skype for this climactic

7
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:17,590
episode.

8
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,341
ZAC: Cue cut to Ashley!

9
00:00:19,341 --> 00:00:28,132
MATT: Yay! Hi Ashley! She's dancing for it. So
sorry for the delay, but we're on here.

10
00:00:28,132 --> 00:00:32,422
ZAC: We've got a couple of quick announcements.
The first announcement is that we're currently

11
00:00:32,422 --> 00:00:38,972
doing a d20 holiday giveaway over on our Facebook
page. That's 20 days of giveaways. We're now on

12
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:46,926
day three and it's a large collection of Dungeons
and Dragons related stuff. There's a command in

13
00:00:46,926 --> 00:00:51,701
the chatroom that the mods are posting right now
if you check that out and we'll also be putting an

14
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:55,660
image up on the screen later that gives you a link
out to it and all that good stuff, so make sure

15
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:01,163
you enter. Lucas has got it up right now. Follow
that link, enter, try to win some D&amp;D cool stuff.

16
00:01:01,163 --> 00:01:09,166
The other big announcement is tomorrow we have a
special Beatles Rubber Soul anniversary concert.

17
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,985
We have eight different bands coming through--

18
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:12,595
SAM: Including the Beatles.

19
00:01:12,595 --> 00:01:15,378
ZAC: Yeah.

20
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:17,266
TALIESIN: Roaches.

21
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:21,089
ZAC: But we have some really great bands coming
through, it's going to be a lot of fun and we're

22
00:01:21,174 --> 00:01:25,809
going to finish out the night with some Beatles
Rock Band so that's going to be really cool. And

23
00:01:25,894 --> 00:01:29,830
on top of that and Group Hug tomorrow, Disney is
really excited about the Ant Man Blu-ray release

24
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,734
so they're sending us--

25
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:33,344
(audio echo)

26
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:40,563
ZAC: Oh, we're getting a looped feedback. I think
we're good. And we're going to be doing a special

27
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:46,790
Ant Man-themed Group Hug with a ton of giveaways
coming to us from Disney to give away during the

28
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:54,022
show. And then on Monday, Michele Morrow during
Massive is giving away a Valve key that was sent

29
00:01:54,022 --> 00:01:59,523
to her and basically it unlocks every single game
Valve has ever made, as well as every game they

30
00:01:59,523 --> 00:02:04,241
will make. So basically, you could own Half-Life
3.

31
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:06,577
MATT: That's a Valve golden ticket.

32
00:02:06,577 --> 00:02:10,532
ZAC: It is. It's a Valve golden ticket. She's
giving it away at 1:30 on Monday, so make sure to

33
00:02:10,532 --> 00:02:14,984
tune in for that. It's the only way to own
Half-Life 3, maybe.

34
00:02:14,984 --> 00:02:16,846
MARISHA: Are employees eligible?

35
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:18,535
ZAC: Are employees eligible?

36
00:02:18,535 --> 00:02:22,760
MATT: Technically, we're not employees, but no.

37
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,289
ZAC: Damn it.

38
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:30,750
TALIESIN: I can be active in the chatroom. I'll be
so active in the chatroom.

39
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:36,266
MATT: It is tempting. Okay, so a couple of
announcements we have on our end to get things

40
00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:41,264
started as we wait for Laura Bailey to arrive.
She's currently driving here as fast as she can

41
00:02:41,264 --> 00:02:48,026
from The Video Game Awards, where they announced
her character in Uncharted. That's awesome! Super

42
00:02:48,026 --> 00:02:49,234
stoked about that.

43
00:02:49,234 --> 00:02:50,384
LIAM: Another great indie game.

44
00:02:50,384 --> 00:02:52,095
MATT: Yeah, no, I'm really pulling for that
series.

45
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:54,048
MARISHA: Hope it does well.

46
00:02:54,048 --> 00:03:00,004
TALIESIN: I hope it gets the recognition it so
should get. Rises above a cult hit.

47
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:06,962
MATT: She'll be here shortly, but congrats to
Laura on that whenever she arrives. Let's see.

48
00:03:06,962 --> 00:03:12,549
Starting at eight o'clock tonight. It's a little
delayed due to scheduling craziness but starting

49
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:18,856
at 8:00 tonight, you will be able to see Ashley
Johnson's playlist for Pike on the website will be

50
00:03:18,856 --> 00:03:19,841
going up.

51
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:21,785
LIAM: It's pretty rich.

52
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,545
MATT: It's an awesome one. Been listening to it
for a lot of the day.

53
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:25,713
ASHLEY: Yeah!

54
00:03:25,713 --> 00:03:31,294
MATT: Indeed! So that'll be going up at 8:00
tonight, and I believe mine will be going up next

55
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:39,978
week. That one's been an adventure in crafting so
far so I hope you guys enjoy that. Let me throw to

56
00:03:39,978 --> 00:03:41,857
you guys for the comic if you want to go through
that real fast.

57
00:03:41,857 --> 00:03:43,673
TALIESIN: Comic went up on Wednesday.

58
00:03:43,673 --> 00:03:45,791
MARISHA: Yeah, and last week when we weren't
here.

59
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:46,845
TALIESIN: Two comics.

60
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:47,878
MARISHA: Two comics!

61
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:49,382
TALIESIN: What are you going to do?

62
00:03:49,382 --> 00:03:50,970
SAM: Where do you find those comics, guys?

63
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,515
MARISHA: You can find those comics at
geekandsundry.com.

64
00:03:53,515 --> 00:03:56,486
SAM: Okay, and what are they?

65
00:03:56,486 --> 00:04:02,299
MARISHA: They're awesome little four-panel weekly
comic strips going through the backstory of Vox

66
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:04,063
Machina at the Winter's Crest Festival.

67
00:04:04,063 --> 00:04:07,149
TALIESIN: Our first Winter's Crest Festival
together running around, causing havoc, being

68
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:08,869
adorable. Just in time for Christmas.

69
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:11,515
SAM: And those viewers have to pay extra to get
that, don't they?

70
00:04:11,515 --> 00:04:12,863
MARISHA: Not at all, Sam!

71
00:04:12,863 --> 00:04:13,843
SAM: What?

72
00:04:13,843 --> 00:04:16,522
MARISHA: Of course! This is all free through the
Geek and Sundry website.

73
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,917
SAM: Oh my goodness! Well, I'm going to click on
it right now.

74
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:20,882
MARISHA: You should! After the show.

75
00:04:20,882 --> 00:04:21,681
SAM: Okay.

76
00:04:21,681 --> 00:04:24,919
(laughter)

77
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:30,840
MATT: Thank you guys. Yeah, it's actually a pretty
fun arc. It's one of the more lighthearted Vox

78
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,485
Machina background moments.

79
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:35,465
MARISHA: It's us being cute, surrounded by all the
sadness.

80
00:04:35,465 --> 00:04:36,536
TALIESIN: Eight weeks of cute.

81
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:38,058
LIAM: We'll be cute in three hours.

82
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:40,096
SAM: We'll be dead in three hours.

83
00:04:40,096 --> 00:04:41,858
MATT: Don't say that! You don't know.

84
00:04:41,858 --> 00:04:43,968
TALIESIN: We need photography of the 19th century
over here.

85
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:46,867
MATT: Well, dice will tell.

86
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:55,001
LIAM: I can't wait to see the old-timey photos of
our propped up dead bodies. Dressed finely.

87
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:56,659
MATT: You're horrible.

88
00:04:56,659 --> 00:05:00,676
TALIESIN: I'm just saying we need daguerreotypes.
I think it might be time to do it.

89
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:06,639
MATT: Perfect. Also, I recently found out that
Obsidian had released the Pillars of Eternity

90
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,446
soundtrack on iTunes. The same soundtrack that
they let us use on our show for background. It's

91
00:05:11,446 --> 00:05:15,096
an awesome soundtrack, and if you're a fan of the
game or if you're just a fan of good atmospheric

92
00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:18,943
soundtrack music, go check it out. It's on iTunes,
so thank you Obsidian again!

93
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,624
MARISHA and LIAM: Thanks, Obsidian!

94
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:27,039
MATT: Critmas for this month is next week. We
pushed it back a week because tonight's episode is

95
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,377
a little crazy or it's looking to become so,
depending, and we wanted to give you a little more

96
00:05:32,377 --> 00:05:36,726
time to get things in for Critmas for the actual
holiday season. So we'll be calling it Critmas

97
00:05:36,726 --> 00:05:38,372
slash what was it you said, Taliesin?

98
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:40,930
TALIESIN: Oh, Voxanukkah!

99
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,446
MATT: Voxanukkah, there we go.
Critmas/Voxanukkah.

100
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:45,152
(laughter)

101
00:05:45,152 --> 00:05:46,666
TALIESIN: I'll keep them coming.

102
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:54,581
MATT: Yeah, this'll be our fun month event. We're
excited about that. Let's see. If you want to go

103
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:56,190
ahead and take the announcement--

104
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,331
LIAM: Yeah. Yes, many of you have been taking
advantage of our code CRITROLE with Wyrmwood

105
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:06,055
Gaming, but not all of you so the rest of you go
over to Wyrmwood Gaming. If you use CRITROLE, you

106
00:06:06,055 --> 00:06:14,824
get free shipping for any of their beautiful
boxes. Mine is Gabon ebony. It's black I really

107
00:06:14,824 --> 00:06:15,776
like it.

108
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:18,830
MATT: I hope it's Gabon. Because you already
mentioned Valve at one point tonight and it's

109
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,765
important that we all pray to Gaben together.

110
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:23,675
LIAM: They're gorgeous. Many different colors.
Make great Christmas present stocking stuffers.

111
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,913
Put your dice in them. You'll like them.

112
00:06:26,913 --> 00:06:29,866
ASHLEY: I haven't gotten to see mine in person
yet, and I'm excited.

113
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:31,138
MARISHA: We have yours.

114
00:06:31,138 --> 00:06:33,116
MATT: We've got to get it to you when you come
back in town.

115
00:06:33,116 --> 00:06:34,064
ASHLEY: Yeah!

116
00:06:34,064 --> 00:06:39,191
MATT: By the way, thank you for tweeting your
comics today, which sent everyone into a tizzy

117
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:40,927
thinking that you were here in LA.

118
00:06:40,927 --> 00:06:42,494
SAM and MATT: Including us.

119
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:49,968
ASHLEY: I know! I didn't even mean-- I just pulled
them out of my suitcase today. And then some

120
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:54,937
people were tweeting back and I was like, "Oh,
shit. It looks like I'm at home." I was like,

121
00:06:54,937 --> 00:06:56,104
"Ah, well."

122
00:06:56,104 --> 00:06:58,077
TRAVIS: Mass panic, it's no big deal.

123
00:06:58,077 --> 00:07:01,706
MATT: You're technically still here. And you know
what, actually right next to Travis, you guys are

124
00:07:01,884 --> 00:07:03,852
size appropriate for the group, so it works out
well.

125
00:07:03,852 --> 00:07:05,133
ASHLEY: Really? (laughs)

126
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,838
TRAVIS: Hello, Pike!

127
00:07:06,838 --> 00:07:09,835
ASHLEY: Wait for it. "Oh hi, Grog!"

128
00:07:09,835 --> 00:07:11,274
TRAVIS: Oh hi, Pike!

129
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:12,630
(laughter)

130
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,060
MATT and MARISHA: There we go.

131
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,818
MATT: That's amazing.

132
00:07:14,818 --> 00:07:16,557
ASHLEY: Wait, high five!

133
00:07:16,557 --> 00:07:23,540
MATT: Yay! Slowest high five ever. Awesome. Then
just reminding you guys, we've got a couple more

134
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,527
weeks before the holiday season. We got a bunch of
our awesome shirts up on the website including the

135
00:07:28,592 --> 00:07:31,858
How Do You Want To Do This? shirt that Marisha's
wearing tonight, which is apparently also selling

136
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:32,946
out again.

137
00:07:32,946 --> 00:07:34,199
MARISHA: Oh, is it sold out again?

138
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,272
MATT: Certain sizes are.

139
00:07:35,272 --> 00:07:36,385
MARISHA: Certain sizes are?

140
00:07:36,385 --> 00:07:38,732
MATT: We're pushing to get more in, hopefully.

141
00:07:38,732 --> 00:07:40,745
SAM: Better get them while you can.

142
00:07:40,745 --> 00:07:43,465
MATT: And the Critmas sweater, which is
delightful, too.

143
00:07:43,465 --> 00:07:46,501
TRAVIS: It is delightful, isn't it?

144
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:50,791
SAM: You can also get these by donating to the
Obama campaign eight years ago. Just so you know.

145
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,894
TRAVIS: I don't know if they have any left but
they might.

146
00:07:52,894 --> 00:07:58,726
MATT: Does anybody else have any announcements
they want to make at this time?

147
00:07:58,726 --> 00:08:01,593
LIAM: I am nervous.

148
00:08:01,593 --> 00:08:03,125
ASHLEY: I am so nervous.

149
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,336
MARISHA: And terrified.

150
00:08:04,336 --> 00:08:05,613
TRAVIS: I'm calm.

151
00:08:05,613 --> 00:08:14,712
MATT: Perfect, perfect. Well, cool. That being the
case, then, let's go ahead and let's go ahead

152
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,049
and jump in.

153
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:18,147
TRAVIS: Oh shit, okay.

154
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:27,055
MATT: Exactly. To get you guys up to speed: the
party, Vox Machina, after having a relatively

155
00:08:27,055 --> 00:08:32,359
violent encounter with a couple known as the
Briarwoods-- Lady Delilah Briarwood and Lord Sylas

156
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:38,379
Briarwood, two individuals who were responsible
for essentially torturing and murdering Percy's

157
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:43,891
family and taking over his town of Whitestone and
for the past five years have ruled it, guiding it

158
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:50,629
into some dark direction they've begun to recently
unravel. The party traveled to Whitestone to clear

159
00:08:50,694 --> 00:08:55,230
their name as they were essentially put in a bad
political position with their home town of Emon

160
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:02,417
and to possibly bring vengeance for what Percy's
family had undergone five years before.

161
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:09,555
Upon arriving they found the town in a very dark
emotional place. Zombie giants roving the streets

162
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:16,258
as these controlled centurions. A number of
individuals in the town feeling the general

163
00:09:16,258 --> 00:09:25,672
unrest. And they decided to build a revolt. Percy
helming the de Rolo crest, Vox Machina went around

164
00:09:25,672 --> 00:09:30,430
inciting the thoughts of rebellion in the city.
Not the first but apparently the one with the most

165
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:39,107
chance of succeeding they've had to this date.
After some infiltrations and sizable victories

166
00:09:39,107 --> 00:09:45,087
cutting down some of the underlings of the
Briarwoods within the city, the people began to

167
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:53,094
arm themselves, rise up, and fire, blade and
screaming took the city as the denizens began to

168
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:58,935
fight back. In this chaos, Vox Machina made their
way underneath the Castle Whitestone, where the

169
00:09:58,935 --> 00:10:04,354
Lord and Lady Briarwood currently reside, seeking
some sort of a project called the ziggurat they've

170
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,114
been working on for a while.

171
00:10:06,114 --> 00:10:10,023
While they were down there they found a woman,
apparently imprisoned, under an illusion that they

172
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:16,014
revealed to be Anna Ripley. Dr. Anna Ripley, one
of the torturers of Percy five years before and

173
00:10:16,014 --> 00:10:22,288
currently seemingly interested in the black powder
based gun tech he had been developing. However,

174
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:27,967
they took her captive, went upstairs, and
discovered that Percy's sister, Cassandra, is

175
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:34,193
indeed still alive and being held captive within
the castle. In the process of trying to save her

176
00:10:34,193 --> 00:10:39,893
Anna Ripley got away, Cassandra got her throat cut
but thankfully was saved by the quick actions of

177
00:10:39,893 --> 00:10:48,141
Vox Machina and the near death's door stepping of
Vax once again. But nevertheless, saved her,

178
00:10:48,141 --> 00:10:50,274
prevented her disastrous fate--

179
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,448
LIAM: Before anyone entered the room.

180
00:10:52,448 --> 00:10:53,791
MATT: That's true.

181
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:58,725
(laughter)

182
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:05,937
MATT: So, having Cassandra saved, some intense
conversations began. Some discussions of some

183
00:11:05,937 --> 00:11:13,904
elements of the Briarwoods' real intentions. They
found notes within Professor Anders's room, one of

184
00:11:13,904 --> 00:11:20,074
the other individuals responsible for rising up
against Percy's family back in the day. Found

185
00:11:20,074 --> 00:11:24,813
materials that could clear their name back in Emon
and Cassandra armed up. They made their way down

186
00:11:24,813 --> 00:11:30,554
to the basement of the city into the undercroft
and through the mausoleum that contained the

187
00:11:30,554 --> 00:11:33,536
descendants of the de Rolo family.

188
00:11:33,536 --> 00:11:37,919
After which, a series of ghosts, seemingly
haunting that vicinity since the darkness that

189
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,936
took this kingdom took hold, began to possess the
party into a rough battle in which they were

190
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:50,356
forced to fight themselves. The ghosts were
ousted, destroyed, and the party, regathering what

191
00:11:50,356 --> 00:11:57,442
powers they still have at their disposal to begin
to delve into the seemingly recently dug tunnel

192
00:11:57,442 --> 00:12:03,298
beneath the city of Whitestone towards whatever
this ziggurat project is. And that is where we

193
00:12:03,298 --> 00:12:05,036
left off last time.

194
00:12:05,036 --> 00:12:14,275
As you guys have taken a moment to gather
your breath after the undercroft infiltration of

195
00:12:14,361 --> 00:12:19,228
these spirits, one of the last of which Scanlan
shamed into a redeath--

196
00:12:19,228 --> 00:12:22,153
(laughter)

197
00:12:22,153 --> 00:12:29,492
MATT: You've all gathered yourself, taken a short
rest to heal up. Whatever else you want to do to

198
00:12:29,492 --> 00:12:35,786
prepare at this time. You know, discussion, items,
preparation, trading, anything you want to do

199
00:12:35,786 --> 00:12:39,929
before you delve any further into this tunnel
underneath the city of Whitestone, now is the time

200
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:40,905
to do so.

201
00:12:40,905 --> 00:12:46,570
SAM: We're in the crypt? The sarcophagus sort of
thing.

202
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,415
MATT: That's the actual official name, yes.

203
00:12:48,415 --> 00:12:52,546
LIAM: Percival, do you know anything-- Do you know
what's just ahead of us?

204
00:12:52,611 --> 00:12:55,144
TALIESIN: I don't think so.

205
00:12:55,144 --> 00:13:01,365
MATT: No, the back wall of this mausoleum was
originally just a wall. There was a large

206
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:09,342
20-foot wide cavern that is chiseled through
the stonework and appears to delve deeper into the

207
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,983
ground behind them.

208
00:13:10,983 --> 00:13:15,837
ALL: Whoa!

209
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,869
MATT: We got a Laura Bailey!

210
00:13:17,869 --> 00:13:19,763
LAURA: What's up, buddies?

211
00:13:19,763 --> 00:13:22,883
LIAM: Award show variant costume!

212
00:13:22,883 --> 00:13:25,394
(laughter)

213
00:13:25,394 --> 00:13:28,113
MATT: The Comic-Con night on the town.

214
00:13:28,113 --> 00:13:31,618
LAURA: That's right. (gasps) Hey Ashley!

215
00:13:31,618 --> 00:13:36,334
ASHLEY: Oh, hello Laura! You look so pretty!

216
00:13:36,334 --> 00:13:39,442
LAURA: Oh my gosh, that's so cool!

217
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:41,042
LIAM: She can't see you there.

218
00:13:41,042 --> 00:13:42,565
MATT: Congratulations, by the way.

219
00:13:42,565 --> 00:13:43,668
LAURA: Oh, thank you!

220
00:13:43,668 --> 00:13:44,626
SAM: Did you--?

221
00:13:44,626 --> 00:13:47,470
LAURA: No, I didn't win. They were unveiling my
character in Uncharted tonight.

222
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,116
SAM: Did you go onstage?

223
00:13:49,116 --> 00:13:55,236
LAURA: I didn't, no. I just sat there and then I
went, "Okay, well, I've got to go!" And I got up

224
00:13:55,236 --> 00:13:57,082
and ran and I feel like an idiot.

225
00:13:57,082 --> 00:13:58,224
TRAVIS: We got Briarwoods to kill.

226
00:13:58,224 --> 00:14:00,780
TALIESIN: Briorities.

227
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,572
MATT: Well, I'm glad you could join us. Thank you
for that.

228
00:14:03,572 --> 00:14:04,911
SAM: Did you say Briorities?

229
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:05,920
TALIESIN: Briorities.

230
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,988
LAURA: Briorities.

231
00:14:06,988 --> 00:14:08,241
MATT: Taliesin!

232
00:14:08,241 --> 00:14:12,111
TRAVIS: We don't know if we have any further to go
from this crypt? Uncharted?

233
00:14:12,111 --> 00:14:17,582
LAURA: That's my thing! Oh, there's no drink in
my--

234
00:14:17,582 --> 00:14:18,969
LIAM: Well, go quick.

235
00:14:18,969 --> 00:14:20,553
MARISHA: Do it, it's fine. We're just starting.

236
00:14:20,553 --> 00:14:21,950
LIAM: I didn't want to touch it.

237
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:25,163
TALIESIN: We've literally not had a conversation.

238
00:14:25,163 --> 00:14:26,504
MARISHA: We haven't done anything.

239
00:14:26,504 --> 00:14:28,031
SAM: All right, I'm going to charge in!

240
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:31,428
(laughter)

241
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:38,971
TRAVIS: I would like to take a vial of holy oil
that I have out of the Bag of Holding and keep it

242
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:43,563
in my hand. Just out, so I don't have to get it
out.

243
00:14:43,563 --> 00:14:49,118
MARISHA: Grog, speaking of. How many health
potions do you have? I feel like we might need to

244
00:14:49,118 --> 00:14:50,308
redistribute.

245
00:14:50,308 --> 00:14:52,918
TRAVIS: I have a shitload. I never really use
them.

246
00:14:52,918 --> 00:14:54,550
MARISHA: You should do that.

247
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:59,514
TRAVIS: I have two level awesome-- what are the
biggest ones?

248
00:14:59,514 --> 00:15:00,807
SAM: Greater?

249
00:15:00,807 --> 00:15:02,210
MATT: There's greater or superior.

250
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:07,304
TRAVIS: I have two superior, one the top one, and
five of the low ones.

251
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:09,355
TALIESIN: Can I take two of the low ones,
possibly?

252
00:15:09,355 --> 00:15:12,621
MATT: Superior would be the highest you've
received so far.

253
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,047
TRAVIS: Okay then I have one of those.

254
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:18,725
LIAM: I am all out of tricks, just about, so may I
please have a superior, Grog?

255
00:15:18,725 --> 00:15:21,528
TRAVIS: Oh boy, does everybody want a piece of this
pie?

256
00:15:21,528 --> 00:15:24,252
(laughter)

257
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,653
TRAVIS: Well, what are you offering?

258
00:15:26,653 --> 00:15:34,535
LIAM: I'm offering safety for your facial hair for
perpetuity.

259
00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:36,403
TRAVIS: Nope. Give me something else.

260
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:37,659
LIAM: Now it's in danger.

261
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:43,616
MARISHA: How about safety for your life because
we'll be having your back and whatnot?

262
00:15:43,616 --> 00:15:48,898
TRAVIS: How could you have my back if it's on me?

263
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:52,035
MARISHA: I'm going to let that one go.

264
00:15:52,035 --> 00:16:00,974
LIAM: I will let you flick me hard, hard in the
nads, should we survive.

265
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:06,246
TRAVIS: How about you let me flick you hard in the
nads now and I'll give you a healing potion?

266
00:16:06,246 --> 00:16:08,377
LIAM: Can we take a short rest after that?

267
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:10,577
(laughter)

268
00:16:10,577 --> 00:16:12,638
LAURA: What is happening? (laughs)

269
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,207
TRAVIS: Just a little one. I won't even rage or
nothing. It'll just be a quick little tap on your

270
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:17,533
walnut.

271
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:19,279
LIAM: I will do this trade.

272
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:25,145
TRAVIS: Yes! I kneel down and I get right up to
his bits.

273
00:16:25,145 --> 00:16:30,744
LIAM: Wait! I pull a stick out of my bag and I put
it in my mouth and I bite down very hard on it.

274
00:16:30,744 --> 00:16:39,077
SAM: I'm going to use Minor Illusion to create a
bull's eye right around his crotch. Concentric

275
00:16:39,077 --> 00:16:41,414
circles glowing.

276
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:45,257
TRAVIS: And like the second grader I am trying to
write in cursive I have my tongue sticking out

277
00:16:45,257 --> 00:16:52,163
like-- and I shift from using the middle finger
down to the ring finger because we're being nice.

278
00:16:52,163 --> 00:16:54,933
And I go for-- are you right-handed?

279
00:16:54,933 --> 00:16:56,279
LIAM: Yeah.

280
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:59,729
TRAVIS: I go for the left nut. (whack)

281
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:01,838
LIAM: (groans)

282
00:17:01,838 --> 00:17:07,064
TRAVIS: Does he throw up?

283
00:17:07,064 --> 00:17:10,735
MATT: No, but you do take one point of damage.

284
00:17:10,735 --> 00:17:12,055
TRAVIS: Yes!

285
00:17:12,055 --> 00:17:16,350
LAURA: Just one? It's just a ring finger but it's
still a goliath.

286
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,884
TRAVIS: Is there a little cough?

287
00:17:18,884 --> 00:17:23,315
MATT: Yeah, there's definitely enough of a
reaction to be worth your--

288
00:17:23,315 --> 00:17:27,389
LIAM: (hoarse) There's no sound. At all.

289
00:17:27,389 --> 00:17:31,225
TRAVIS: All right. I will give you one of the--
there's three different levels or just the two?

290
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:36,094
MATT: Well, you have, you have common. Sorry, the
healing potion, the greater healing and the

291
00:17:36,094 --> 00:17:37,004
superior.

292
00:17:37,004 --> 00:17:39,089
LIAM: (hoarse) The good one, fucker.

293
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:49,975
TRAVIS: I'll give you the greater. I give him a
greater. And Percy. I like it when you turn into

294
00:17:49,975 --> 00:17:55,383
the giant cloud thing so you don't have to take a
nutshot. Would you like a common or a greater?

295
00:17:55,383 --> 00:17:59,173
TALIESIN: Actually, if I could steal two commons,
just to be on the safe side.

296
00:17:59,173 --> 00:18:03,725
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay. I give him two common.

297
00:18:03,725 --> 00:18:07,902
TALIESIN: I offer the satisfaction of Vax knowing
that I got them for free.

298
00:18:07,902 --> 00:18:18,982
MATT: Cassandra also steps forward and says, "I
myself do not have any sort of potion of

299
00:18:18,982 --> 00:18:21,793
"protection. Does anyone have anything which they
could offer?"

300
00:18:21,793 --> 00:18:26,509
SAM: Yes, hello, hi. I look like your brother but
I'm shorter.

301
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:29,349
MATT: Yes, that's right. By the way, everyone is
currently--

302
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:31,169
TALIESIN: Currently everybody looks--

303
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:36,406
MATT: Like either Percy or Cassandra, thanks to
Scanlan's Seeming, which is really awkward.

304
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:41,454
LIAM: (hoarse) Are we going to hold this up for
when we go against the Briarwoods? I think it'll

305
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,906
be confusing.

306
00:18:42,906 --> 00:18:50,727
SAM: Yeah, for them. You can have one of my
greater healing potions. Will that suffice?

307
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:55,782
MATT: "Certainly, thank you." And she comes
forward and reaches out towards you and you have

308
00:18:55,782 --> 00:18:58,692
to reach up and put it in her hand because she's
reaching out towards a much taller figure.

309
00:18:58,692 --> 00:19:01,345
SAM: Oh, I look like a full-size Percy?

310
00:19:01,345 --> 00:19:04,999
MATT: A little larger. In between.

311
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:05,842
SAM: Oh, cool.

312
00:19:05,842 --> 00:19:07,898
TALIESIN: I throw her one of my commons as well.

313
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:13,878
TRAVIS: I have three commons, two greaters, and one
superior. I'm a walking medicine cabinet.

314
00:19:13,897 --> 00:19:15,194
MATT: You are.

315
00:19:15,194 --> 00:19:18,874
SAM: Speaking of looking like Percy and Cassandra.
Vex.

316
00:19:18,874 --> 00:19:20,240
LAURA: Huh?

317
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,355
SAM: That is you, right?

318
00:19:22,355 --> 00:19:24,487
LAURA: That's me, yes, what?

319
00:19:24,487 --> 00:19:33,077
SAM: Vex, if you, if you look like Cassandra, you
could conceivably get in front of the Briarwoods

320
00:19:33,077 --> 00:19:38,522
without them knowing that it's an enemy for a
moment. Maybe long enough to fire off one of

321
00:19:38,522 --> 00:19:41,438
your-- don't you have some sort of sunbeam arrow
or something?

322
00:19:41,438 --> 00:19:48,241
LAURA: I have no sunbeam arrow, but I would like
to dip some arrows in some holy oil at this moment

323
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:49,564
in time.

324
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:50,745
MATT: All right.

325
00:19:50,745 --> 00:19:55,618
LAURA: I do have potentially an exploding holy
arrow.

326
00:19:55,618 --> 00:19:58,788
SAM: That would be pretty baller.

327
00:19:58,788 --> 00:20:00,990
MATT: Is this the one with the question mark?

328
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,879
LAURA: No, this is a normal one, and then I have a
question mark, as well.

329
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:06,387
MATT: Do you want to dip them both?

330
00:20:06,387 --> 00:20:07,699
LAURA: Fuck yes, I do.

331
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:10,903
MATT: (laughs) Okay. You have two more uses of
your holy oil, I believe, right?

332
00:20:10,968 --> 00:20:17,236
LAURA: Yes. Well, no. Each thing takes three
arrows, so I can do six arrows altogether.

333
00:20:17,236 --> 00:20:19,237
MATT: You're using it all right now?

334
00:20:19,237 --> 00:20:21,449
TRAVIS: Will it wear off?

335
00:20:21,449 --> 00:20:22,938
MATT: It lasts for an hour.

336
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:25,506
LAURA: Are we going to get there?

337
00:20:25,506 --> 00:20:28,239
SAM: I don't know. We could fight them in five
minutes.

338
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:31,048
LAURA: I want to do it right before we walk in the
room, Matt.

339
00:20:31,048 --> 00:20:32,683
MATT: It's up to you. You can hold off.

340
00:20:32,683 --> 00:20:35,007
LIAM: We don't see a ziggurat yet.

341
00:20:35,007 --> 00:20:41,185
TALIESIN: Let's start making our way down there,
and I can't believe I'm going to say this, but

342
00:20:41,185 --> 00:20:43,689
we'll have Vax scout ahead.

343
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:47,204
SAM: Don't do anything!

344
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:52,104
LAURA: Don't do anything. Look. Don't touch.

345
00:20:52,104 --> 00:20:55,036
TALIESIN: Vax, we've discussed our new password.
Do you remember the new password?

346
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:56,685
SAM: Which is?

347
00:20:56,685 --> 00:20:58,076
LAURA: Is there something different?

348
00:20:58,076 --> 00:20:59,670
LIAM: Is it Candyland? No, I don't remember.

349
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,465
TALIESIN: It's now "Jenga, one one-thousand, two
one-thousand, three one-thousand, four

350
00:21:03,465 --> 00:21:07,734
"one-thousand, five one-thousand, six one-thousand,
seven one-thousand, eight one-thousand, nine

351
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:09,353
"one-thousand, ten."

352
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:13,559
LIAM: I just got flicked in the nuts. I'm not
doing that. I'll say jenga.

353
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:16,488
LAURA: And then wait.

354
00:21:16,488 --> 00:21:24,579
LIAM: Yeah, I'll wait. So long as no more of your
siblings are in danger. I did do it for reasons.

355
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:25,823
TALIESIN: We know.

356
00:21:25,823 --> 00:21:29,730
LIAM: You know because I told you.

357
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,880
TALIESIN: Yes. I consider the matter settled.

358
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,995
LIAM: I don't know exactly what was going to
happen, but I saw a blade against your sister's

359
00:21:37,995 --> 00:21:42,288
throat. I would hope you would do the same for my
sister if you were to see the same thing.

360
00:21:42,288 --> 00:21:43,322
TALIESIN: Yes.

361
00:21:43,322 --> 00:21:44,616
LAURA: Of course he would.

362
00:21:44,616 --> 00:21:47,071
TALIESIN: But mostly because I fear her.

363
00:21:47,071 --> 00:21:51,665
LIAM: Scanlan, back me up. If you were to turn
into some sort of three-horned beast and go

364
00:21:51,665 --> 00:21:59,360
running into a house full of enemies, we would
give him a similar talking-to, correct?

365
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,431
SAM: That would never happen. I'm more measured
than all of you.

366
00:22:02,431 --> 00:22:06,098
TALIESIN: We don't actually believe that he will
listen to sense.

367
00:22:06,098 --> 00:22:07,942
SAM: I'm Percy.

368
00:22:07,942 --> 00:22:11,623
(laughter)

369
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:15,670
TALIESIN: We just can't waste our breath, really.

370
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,261
LIAM: Scanlan, shut up.

371
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:20,510
TRAVIS: Attunement. How long does that take?

372
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,817
MATT: A short rest.

373
00:22:21,817 --> 00:22:24,812
TALIESIN: This is going to be a very complicated
evening.

374
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:26,094
TRAVIS: Should we take a short rest?

375
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,263
TALIESIN: We just did.

376
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:28,252
TRAVIS: We did?

377
00:22:28,252 --> 00:22:29,423
LAURA: Oh, we did!

378
00:22:29,423 --> 00:22:31,293
MATT: If you wanted to attune to something during
that short rest, you can.

379
00:22:31,293 --> 00:22:33,743
TRAVIS: Can I attune to Boots of Levitation?

380
00:22:33,743 --> 00:22:34,933
MATT: If you'd like to, yeah.

381
00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:36,021
TRAVIS: I would like to.

382
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:36,950
MATT: Okay.

383
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,065
LIAM: We just rested for 30 minutes?

384
00:22:39,065 --> 00:22:40,472
MATT: Roughly 30 minutes, yeah.

385
00:22:40,472 --> 00:22:42,754
LIAM: How would everyone feel about another seven
and a half hours?

386
00:22:42,754 --> 00:22:44,823
LAURA: We can't sleep in this--

387
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:51,943
SAM: Our meal is still active, as well. We need
the benefits of that. Plus, there is a rebellion

388
00:22:51,943 --> 00:22:57,209
going on. It's been, what, an hour? Two hours?
They're probably mostly dead by now.

389
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,901
MARISHA: That's possibly very true, actually.

390
00:22:59,901 --> 00:23:00,928
TALIESIN: Cassandra?

391
00:23:00,928 --> 00:23:02,010
MATT: "Yes?"

392
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:05,664
TALIESIN: In your opinion, who's the more
dangerous target?

393
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:15,679
MATT: She gets distant for a second, thinking, and
haphazardly pulls the hair over her ear and rubs

394
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:22,722
her armor in a nervous way. Looks over out of the
side of her eyes to you and says, "They're both

395
00:23:22,722 --> 00:23:32,735
"dangerous for different reasons. Separately, Sylas
is dangerous because of his unnatural nature. I've

396
00:23:32,735 --> 00:23:40,785
"seen him turn arguments and opposing sides into
friendships in but an instant. He has some sort of

397
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:46,879
"power over the mind of those he looks to. That in
itself is a danger, not to mention his other

398
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:55,330
"capabilities. I've only seen him use it twice, but
that blade he carries is as dark as he is.

399
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:04,494
"That being said, Lady Briarwood, Delilah, she
carries magic far more powerful than I've seen.

400
00:24:04,494 --> 00:24:12,544
"She on her own was able to create, run, and rule
each of these sentries that run about the entire

401
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:21,314
"city. She had half of the entire castle staffed
with long-dead individuals. None questioned her.

402
00:24:21,314 --> 00:24:27,423
"I've never seen her in battle, but I sense there
is far more to her abilities than I've seen.

403
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:37,956
"The two of them together are driven-- more so
than the affiliation to this Whispered One they

404
00:24:37,956 --> 00:24:46,820
"talk of, they're driven by one thing, and that's
their affection for each other. As long as they

405
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:53,413
"are together, who knows what they're capable of."

406
00:24:53,413 --> 00:24:54,700
LAURA: So we split them up?

407
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,723
TRAVIS: Yeah, we've got to divide and conquer this
shit.

408
00:24:56,723 --> 00:24:58,225
TALIESIN: If we can.

409
00:24:58,225 --> 00:25:01,029
TRAVIS: If we can.

410
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:02,556
MARISHA: Cassandra.

411
00:25:02,556 --> 00:25:03,483
MATT: "Yes?"

412
00:25:03,483 --> 00:25:09,323
MARISHA: Has there been any instance where the two
have separated in the recent months, that you can

413
00:25:09,323 --> 00:25:12,043
imagine or remember?

414
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:21,450
MATT: "Most of the ziggurat construction happens
during the evening, when Sylas is not resting. And

415
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:31,690
"for the most part they journey together-- for the
past month, at least. No, I haven't seen them

416
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,224
"apart, really."

417
00:25:33,224 --> 00:25:35,666
MARISHA: Can you think of any reason why they
would separate?

418
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:41,058
MATT: "Not unless something in the sun required
their attention."

419
00:25:41,058 --> 00:25:45,478
MARISHA: Something sudden that required their
attention.

420
00:25:45,478 --> 00:25:46,683
MATT: "In the sun."

421
00:25:46,683 --> 00:25:48,080
MARISHA: In the sun?

422
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,977
MATT: "Sylas does not appear to like being
outside."

423
00:25:50,977 --> 00:26:00,386
TRAVIS: Yeah, one thing. Do we want to take the
battle to them down here? Or do we want to try and

424
00:26:00,386 --> 00:26:03,056
lure them outside?

425
00:26:03,056 --> 00:26:07,062
LIAM: I think we would definitely prefer them
outside, but what would draw them out?

426
00:26:07,062 --> 00:26:08,506
I do not know.

427
00:26:08,506 --> 00:26:15,921
LAURA: What if we used Seeming and made one of us
seem like Lady Briarwood?

428
00:26:15,921 --> 00:26:18,411
TALIESIN: I think they would see through that.

429
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:19,423
LAURA: Yes?

430
00:26:19,423 --> 00:26:22,159
TRAVIS: They saw through the disguise at the table
back in Emon.

431
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:30,947
SAM: Just to point this out before we go in and
kill ourselves. We have evidence now. We could

432
00:26:30,947 --> 00:26:35,254
abandon this whole thing. Go back and fight our
day in court.

433
00:26:35,254 --> 00:26:41,198
TALIESIN: I want to see what they're building down
there. And I worry that it would be dangerous.

434
00:26:41,198 --> 00:26:46,493
MARISHA: Plus, we'd just abandon this entire
revolution that we caused?

435
00:26:46,493 --> 00:26:51,163
LIAM: People are putting their lives on the line.
Plus, Uriel is suspect now. He's been corrupted;

436
00:26:51,163 --> 00:26:54,734
he is not trustworthy. There's no point going back
to him.

437
00:26:54,734 --> 00:26:59,996
TALIESIN: I can't leave again until this is taken
care of.

438
00:26:59,996 --> 00:27:05,128
SAM: Right, that was a stupid suggestion,
Keyleth.

439
00:27:05,128 --> 00:27:10,878
TRAVIS: Keyleth, come on, we've got to stay.

440
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:14,584
SAM: We're all Seemed differently; it's very
strange.

441
00:27:14,584 --> 00:27:18,150
TRAVIS: I'm really disappointed, Keyleth.

442
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:28,203
LIAM: Cassandra, I want to say something a little
frank. I'm very happy that we've found you. I'm

443
00:27:28,203 --> 00:27:34,598
very happy that Percival and you have been
reunited. We have been burned very badly in the

444
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:44,203
past by seeming allies. And I am sure you are in
your right mind. But past experience has taught us

445
00:27:44,203 --> 00:27:53,443
to be very careful. And we are all watching you.
For signs of corruption or control. I want to

446
00:27:53,443 --> 00:27:59,133
believe you are in control of your faculties. I do
not fully trust you are and I think, just letting

447
00:27:59,133 --> 00:28:08,312
you know that a knife could hit your back as soon
as the slightest misstep happened, is maybe enough

448
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:11,968
to ensure some safety for this group.

449
00:28:11,968 --> 00:28:22,833
MATT: "Of course. It is true I have been living
here, at least in this castle with them, for the

450
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:29,172
"past three years. Not, not of choice, of course.
And were I in your position,

451
00:28:29,172 --> 00:28:31,704
"would think the same."

452
00:28:31,704 --> 00:28:38,926
LIAM: According to Percival, they filled you with
arrows. What happened?

453
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:52,280
MATT: "Well, I was near death. I was recovered by
the father that runs the temple of Pelor and a few

454
00:28:52,280 --> 00:29:02,053
"other individuals who had fled the city at the
time. I was as far-- as I was concerned, I was gone.

455
00:29:02,104 --> 00:29:13,538
"But they nursed me back to health. Slowly. Over
time. I was, for the better part, useless as an

456
00:29:13,538 --> 00:29:20,531
"individual for about six months. And even to this
day, I have a bit of a wheeze when I expend

457
00:29:20,531 --> 00:29:29,880
"myself, but Father Reynal made sure that I was in
good health. And that was when I learned truly

458
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:37,920
"what had become of the city in my restoration. And
it was there that we began to speak of the early

459
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:47,749
"talks of rebellion, here in Whitestone. Me being
still alive was enough of a beacon, for those who

460
00:29:47,749 --> 00:29:56,219
"knew, for us to put together our first attempt to
fight out from under their rule. And it was

461
00:29:56,219 --> 00:30:05,437
"marked. They knew every step we took. Many lives
were lost, but in that fray, they recognized me.

462
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:13,952
"They didn't know I was alive, either. I guess they
saw the importance of keeping me under their lock

463
00:30:13,952 --> 00:30:17,784
"and key as a way of crushing whatever hope those
who still lived here had."

464
00:30:17,784 --> 00:30:26,588
LIAM: Why not hang you from that tree in the
center of town like they did so many others?

465
00:30:26,588 --> 00:30:33,114
MATT: "That would have certainly made a statement.
There were many days when they first took me

466
00:30:33,114 --> 00:30:41,300
"captive I would have welcomed that. But in that
time we planned that first rebellion, I saw fire

467
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:51,032
"in the eyes of my people. Brighter than any I had
witnessed in my youth. I saw their love for my

468
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:59,840
"family. I saw the intent of these people to take
back what was theirs from this corrupt force, and

469
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:07,812
"I knew that I had a part to play. If they choose
to leave me alive, as much as they try and sway my

470
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:13,506
"interests, it also brought me close to them. I
watched them. I could see what they were planning.

471
00:31:13,506 --> 00:31:20,773
"Try and gather details of this construct they're
working on beneath the city and feed this

472
00:31:20,773 --> 00:31:31,609
"information to those who I knew were still true
and behind the de Rolo family name. I don't know

473
00:31:31,609 --> 00:31:33,687
"what I can say to offer you more than that."

474
00:31:33,687 --> 00:31:35,559
LIAM: I don't think there's anything you can say.

475
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:37,423
LAURA: (whispers) Can I insight check her?

476
00:31:37,423 --> 00:31:43,686
LIAM: I want you back in my friend's life, but I'm
sorry, I do not trust you. And I and the others

477
00:31:43,686 --> 00:31:45,435
will be watching.

478
00:31:45,435 --> 00:31:46,539
LAURA: (whispers) 21.

479
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:56,477
MATT: 21? Okay. Looking, every word that comes out
of her mouth comes with conviction, comes from a

480
00:31:56,477 --> 00:32:04,917
look of a person who's recalling a painful memory.
There is nothing that belies any deceit.

481
00:32:04,917 --> 00:32:09,959
SAM: Onward.

482
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:11,544
TRAVIS: Yeah.

483
00:32:11,544 --> 00:32:12,948
LAURA: And upward.

484
00:32:12,948 --> 00:32:15,939
MARISHA: Are we going to try and separate these
two? Is that the plan?

485
00:32:15,939 --> 00:32:19,795
TALIESIN: I think we're going to take the lay of
the land first. See what we're up against.

486
00:32:19,795 --> 00:32:23,434
TRAVIS: Not a bad idea with Cass, but we'll see.

487
00:32:23,434 --> 00:32:24,790
TALIESIN: Vax?

488
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:28,669
LIAM: All right, so I'm going to go ahead through
the hole.

489
00:32:28,669 --> 00:32:30,283
LAURA: Should I stealth with you?

490
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:32,678
LIAM: Sure, you're very good at that now because
of my gift to you.

491
00:32:32,678 --> 00:32:33,795
LAURA: Hey!

492
00:32:33,795 --> 00:32:38,745
MATT: Hey, there you go. You guys are both going
to stealth ahead? Twins, side by side. All right,

493
00:32:38,745 --> 00:32:41,306
go ahead and roll stealth checks. You get
advantage, Laura.

494
00:32:41,306 --> 00:32:44,566
LAURA: I get advantage because of the gold dress.

495
00:32:44,566 --> 00:32:47,232
MARISHA: The sparkles are magical.

496
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:48,620
TALIESIN: Magic sparkles.

497
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,107
LIAM: 32.

498
00:32:50,107 --> 00:32:51,819
TALIESIN: It does look like mithril, doesn't it?

499
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:52,822
LAURA: 23.

500
00:32:52,822 --> 00:32:55,752
MATT: All right. The two of you go ahead. Can I
have a marching order here?

501
00:32:55,752 --> 00:32:57,502
LAURA: Him first.

502
00:32:57,502 --> 00:33:00,842
LIAM: Me first, yeah. Her dress sparkles too
much.

503
00:33:00,842 --> 00:33:02,592
MATT: Trinket stays with the rest of the party, I
assume.

504
00:33:02,592 --> 00:33:03,789
LAURA: Yes, Trinket stays.

505
00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:06,318
MATT: All right. Who's going to be towards the
front of this traveling pack?

506
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,796
LIAM: We're going way ahead.

507
00:33:07,796 --> 00:33:10,042
MATT: Right, but everyone else is following
behind, though.

508
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:12,531
TRAVIS: I'll be in the front. Meat shield.

509
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:13,703
MATT: All righty.

510
00:33:13,703 --> 00:33:15,349
SAM: I will be right behind the meat shield.

511
00:33:15,349 --> 00:33:16,769
TALIESIN: I will be right behind the--

512
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:20,819
LIAM: Percy number four.

513
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:25,558
LAURA: Trinket follows Percy. He's following
Percy.

514
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:27,491
MATT: Okay, Trinket's following Percy.

515
00:33:27,491 --> 00:33:29,277
MARISHA: Following up the ranks with Trinket, I
guess.

516
00:33:29,277 --> 00:33:35,183
MATT: All right. And as soon as you enter the
cavern and begin stepping forward into the tunnel,

517
00:33:35,183 --> 00:33:42,342
there's a flash of light right before you for a
second, blinding you, and you instinctively step

518
00:33:42,342 --> 00:33:47,704
back and pull your daggers out before you realize
the flash is now a glowing symbol on your hand.

519
00:33:47,704 --> 00:33:53,970
The crest of Sarenrae that's been stitched into
your glove is now pulsing with an energy.

520
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:56,720
LIAM: Hi, Pike.

521
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:06,245
MATT: And you hear for a second, call out, Pike's
voice ring through the darkness, and you see

522
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:14,345
before you, out of the shadow, out of the
blackness that is before you in the cavern, a

523
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:17,935
small gnomish hand reach out for you.

524
00:34:17,935 --> 00:34:19,652
ASHLEY: Are you all still there?

525
00:34:19,652 --> 00:34:21,017
LAURA: Pike!

526
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:29,979
LIAM: I take her hand. I take your hand, Pike, and
I kneel down, and I press the back of her hand to

527
00:34:29,979 --> 00:34:33,146
my forehead and hold it there for a moment.

528
00:34:33,146 --> 00:34:40,723
MATT: As you do, the glow from the glove begins to
spread from your hand across, and all of you guys

529
00:34:40,723 --> 00:34:51,829
see materializing out of the darkness Pike's form
slowly unravel into this shadowed area into this

530
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:56,588
glowing beacon of her holy form that you
previously traveled with, as Pike is now once

531
00:34:56,588 --> 00:35:01,286
again brought to this point of clarity here
beneath the castle Whitestone.

532
00:35:01,286 --> 00:35:05,057
TRAVIS: I run over and I knock Vax out of the way
and I pick up Pike and give her a big hug.

533
00:35:05,057 --> 00:35:06,466
LIAM: My nut!

534
00:35:06,466 --> 00:35:10,738
TRAVIS: Oh, Pike, I'm so glad to see you!

535
00:35:10,738 --> 00:35:15,412
ASHLEY: Grog, but you don't look like Grog.

536
00:35:15,412 --> 00:35:19,911
TRAVIS: What? Oh. No. (whispers) It's me.

537
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:25,053
ASHLEY: Is everybody Percy and Cassandra?

538
00:35:25,053 --> 00:35:26,140
ALL: Yes.

539
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,330
LAURA: Except for you, darling.

540
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:32,557
MATT: It's very weird. You're a tiny gnome in
armor, and everyone else looks like Percy and a

541
00:35:32,557 --> 00:35:34,415
woman you've never seen before in your life.

542
00:35:34,415 --> 00:35:35,979
TALIESIN: Bear-Percy is especially disturbing.

543
00:35:35,979 --> 00:35:49,166
MATT: Yeah. This giant rotund Percy on his hands
and legs, just (bear noises).

544
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:50,525
LAURA: That is awkward.

545
00:35:50,525 --> 00:35:58,458
MATT: It's a very strange visual, and you're very
confused momentarily.

546
00:35:58,458 --> 00:36:00,923
ASHLEY: I give Percy-Trink some ear scratches.

547
00:36:00,923 --> 00:36:03,205
LAURA: He likes it.

548
00:36:03,205 --> 00:36:06,457
MATT: (bear noises)

549
00:36:06,457 --> 00:36:12,817
SAM: I run over and I say, Pike, Pike, what
happened, you disappeared before, but now you're

550
00:36:12,817 --> 00:36:15,725
back. Are you here to stay? What's going on?

551
00:36:15,725 --> 00:36:22,627
ASHLEY: I'm here to stay for as long as I can.
It's very hard to stay in this form, especially

552
00:36:22,627 --> 00:36:33,705
when this place is very dark, and sometimes I just
get pulled away, so I'm going to

553
00:36:33,705 --> 00:36:35,596
stay as long as I can.

554
00:36:35,596 --> 00:36:38,461
SAM: We're so happy to have you here.

555
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:39,946
MARISHA: So happy to have you here.

556
00:36:39,946 --> 00:36:46,378
ASHLEY: I'm so happy to be here. How are you, how
are you guys, are you okay, where are you at in

557
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:48,212
terms of health?

558
00:36:48,212 --> 00:36:49,608
SAM: We're all healthy.

559
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:50,651
ASHLEY: Okay.

560
00:36:50,651 --> 00:36:54,871
TRAVIS: Vax is minus a hit point because I hit him
in the nuts. Hah!

561
00:36:54,871 --> 00:36:56,770
ASHLEY: (laughs) Oh, Grog.

562
00:36:56,770 --> 00:37:06,034
SAM: And we have a new member. Well, a new
traveling companion. This is Cassandra.

563
00:37:06,034 --> 00:37:07,421
TALIESIN: Cassandra de Rolo.

564
00:37:07,421 --> 00:37:09,325
LAURA: The actual Cassandra.

565
00:37:09,325 --> 00:37:18,557
ASHLEY: I go over and put my hand out and hold her
hand and say, it's so very nice to finally meet you.

566
00:37:18,557 --> 00:37:24,826
MATT: She takes your hand and looks down curiously
at this tiny gnome that seems to have apparated

567
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:32,858
out of the shadows and gives you a curious look
and a big smile creeps across her face. "It is my

568
00:37:32,858 --> 00:37:42,085
"pleasure to have good people around me for once.
Pleasure to meet you, young gnome." Which is funny

569
00:37:42,085 --> 00:37:48,083
coming from her, because she's technically younger
than you. She looks hardened, but she's younger

570
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:49,355
than you.

571
00:37:49,355 --> 00:37:54,308
LAURA: Well. Shall we?

572
00:37:54,308 --> 00:37:55,950
TALIESIN: Now that we're together.

573
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,360
LAURA: Shall we keep moving?

574
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,057
TRAVIS: Now we're definitely going to kick some
ass.

575
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:01,649
SAM: With Pike with us, we can do anything.

576
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:03,427
MARISHA: Is she glowing?

577
00:38:03,427 --> 00:38:09,937
MATT: Pike is giving low candlelight around her,
so you're going to want to keep her towards the

578
00:38:09,937 --> 00:38:11,119
back, probably.

579
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,251
LAURA: Pike always ruins stealth.

580
00:38:13,251 --> 00:38:15,117
(laughter)

581
00:38:15,117 --> 00:38:17,287
LAURA: Even when she's a ghostly form.

582
00:38:17,287 --> 00:38:20,706
SAM: Can we hang a sheet over her or something?

583
00:38:20,706 --> 00:38:26,023
MATT: You can, it'll be like throwing a t-shirt
over your bedroom light. It'll just be a nice

584
00:38:26,023 --> 00:38:30,048
atmospheric Chinese lantern.

585
00:38:30,048 --> 00:38:31,370
LAURA: Ooh, mood lighting.

586
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,472
MATT: There you go.

587
00:38:32,472 --> 00:38:38,487
LIAM: I place my Sarenrae hand on her shoulder and
say, you're here because she willed you to be

588
00:38:38,487 --> 00:38:48,141
here, she knows that we need you. Now please hide
behind obese Percival. And I pat my sister on the

589
00:38:48,141 --> 00:38:50,880
shoulder and head back into the darkness.

590
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,532
MATT: Okay. So as Pike comes to the back, smiling
at everybody, she joins the back ranks of Keyleth

591
00:38:55,532 --> 00:39:02,666
and Trinket. Actually, probably behind Percy.
Cassandra's going to be right there. Flying V

592
00:39:02,666 --> 00:39:05,537
formation. And you guys continue down this
tunnel.

593
00:39:05,537 --> 00:39:07,278
LAURA: Check for traps.

594
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,613
LIAM: Yeah. Perception all that shit down.

595
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:10,600
MATT: Yeah.

596
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:15,092
LAURA: Yeah, perception. Oh yeah, I should do it
too. Hold on.

597
00:39:15,092 --> 00:39:18,938
LIAM: 20 for me.

598
00:39:18,938 --> 00:39:22,036
LAURA: Yeah, I know, right? 18 for me.

599
00:39:22,036 --> 00:39:31,535
MATT: All right. You guys continue on this slowly
descending tunnel for about ten minutes or so

600
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:43,314
before you see it divide to the left very heavily
and then continue forward. There's still no light

601
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:49,836
source here and so you're relying on your
darkvision to continue, but there's the switchback

602
00:39:49,836 --> 00:39:52,189
to the left and the one that continues forward.

603
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:57,132
LIAM: I lean over to my sister and say, I'm not
going to do anything, I'm just going to look 50

604
00:39:57,132 --> 00:39:58,051
feet down--

605
00:39:58,051 --> 00:40:01,448
LAURA: How about wait a fucking second and let me
look for footprints?

606
00:40:01,448 --> 00:40:02,948
LIAM: All right.

607
00:40:02,948 --> 00:40:05,792
LAURA: Can I look for footprints?

608
00:40:05,792 --> 00:40:07,272
MATT: You can. Make a survival check.

609
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:16,458
LAURA: Okay. I don't know which one to use. I'm so
nervous. Okay, let's do this one. That was a bad

610
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:19,003
one. I'm perceptioning?

611
00:40:19,003 --> 00:40:20,791
MATT: This is a survival.

612
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:25,907
LAURA: Oh. Well, it's the same. That is a 16.

613
00:40:25,907 --> 00:40:34,576
MATT: 16, okay. You get down and inspect the area.
You actually pull out a small bit of torch pith

614
00:40:34,576 --> 00:40:39,621
and light it a bit just to get a little light
across this one intersection briefly. There are

615
00:40:39,621 --> 00:40:44,336
footprints back and forth in all ways, but many of
them have been, at least the footprints coming

616
00:40:44,336 --> 00:40:49,479
from, and the last footprints were coming from
this tunnel to your immediate left, were from a

617
00:40:49,479 --> 00:41:01,537
while back. The fresher footprints, fresh as of
four hours, continue on down that way. You do

618
00:41:01,537 --> 00:41:06,104
notice that the smell of the air itself is, you
notice this as well as you're inspecting, the air

619
00:41:06,104 --> 00:41:14,061
down here has a very acrid, sharp scent anyway, a
hint of chemical. It seems to be getting stronger

620
00:41:14,061 --> 00:41:15,128
to the left.

621
00:41:15,128 --> 00:41:22,810
LAURA: That's where the acid pits are. Acid.
Briarwoods. Briarwoods?

622
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,145
TRAVIS: Yeah.

623
00:41:24,145 --> 00:41:34,143
MATT: All right. Continuing to push forward, about
another five minutes or so, keeping track of your

624
00:41:34,143 --> 00:41:40,819
distance to the castle you're starting to get
towards the outside perimeter of the actual city

625
00:41:40,819 --> 00:41:48,638
itself. As you're keeping tabs on distance
traveled to that area, you catch, based on your

626
00:41:48,638 --> 00:41:57,688
last perception roll, there is a portion of the
floor that seems to have some placed crooked

627
00:41:57,688 --> 00:42:02,078
chunks of stone. You see pieces of broken stone
here and there, things that have fallen out from

628
00:42:02,078 --> 00:42:06,095
being hauled from the distant dig into wherever
the ziggurat is, but there's one section where it

629
00:42:06,095 --> 00:42:08,204
appears there's platforms.

630
00:42:08,204 --> 00:42:09,391
LIAM: Looks a little hinky?

631
00:42:09,391 --> 00:42:12,063
MATT: It looks like it's deliberately placed, as
opposed to dropped and left there.

632
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:20,735
LIAM: I'd like to carefully approach and disarm
anything I can detect or find.

633
00:42:20,735 --> 00:42:22,977
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a check.

634
00:42:22,977 --> 00:42:24,793
LIAM: Is that thieves' tools?

635
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:26,590
MATT: That's thieves' tools, yeah.

636
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,474
LIAM: That's a 27.

637
00:42:28,474 --> 00:42:38,878
MATT: Okay. You find two of the large stone slabs
that are part of this discarded sequence here, they

638
00:42:38,939 --> 00:42:49,358
have beneath them some small magical burst that is
waiting to detonate. You manage to mark it and

639
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:56,822
take a couple of other stone pieces to wedge
underneath it to prevent it from depressing onto

640
00:42:56,822 --> 00:43:00,903
whatever the trigger may be, and note to the rest
of the party to avoid that section.

641
00:43:00,903 --> 00:43:08,104
LIAM: There's a couple of stones here that I've
marked in the middle of the path. Don't step on

642
00:43:08,104 --> 00:43:09,585
them, please.

643
00:43:09,585 --> 00:43:10,828
TALIESIN: Copy.

644
00:43:10,828 --> 00:43:12,623
TRAVIS: Somebody tell Trinket.

645
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:13,831
SAM: And Pike.

646
00:43:13,831 --> 00:43:15,243
LAURA: He fucking understands signs.

647
00:43:15,243 --> 00:43:18,904
MARISHA: I'll be in charge of guiding Trinket.

648
00:43:18,904 --> 00:43:19,874
MATT: Okay.

649
00:43:19,874 --> 00:43:22,519
LAURA: He listens to you.

650
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:26,940
MATT: The awkward large bear-Percy--

651
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,570
LAURA: They got the message.

652
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:34,914
MARISHA: He's still my friend. At least the bear
still loves me.

653
00:43:34,914 --> 00:43:49,506
MATT: You continue forward for another I'd say 20
minutes. Go ahead and make another

654
00:43:49,506 --> 00:43:52,758
perception check.

655
00:43:52,758 --> 00:43:54,856
LIAM: 20.

656
00:43:54,856 --> 00:43:59,797
LAURA: 21. Again.

657
00:43:59,797 --> 00:44:07,867
MATT: Okay. Both of you guys, walking forward,
both step out and look down just in time to stop

658
00:44:07,867 --> 00:44:13,991
your foot from pressing onto what looks to be a
mound of dirt that is, once again, deliberately

659
00:44:13,991 --> 00:44:19,607
placed and a little more fresh than the rest of
the dust-covered hallway. You can see there's an

660
00:44:19,607 --> 00:44:24,539
area that is distinctly a different shade of color
based on the lack of dust on top of it, and you

661
00:44:24,539 --> 00:44:29,090
both stop just in time. Thank you very much. I got
fries.

662
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:36,993
LIAM: I give her the universal rogue movement for
scoot back. Yeah, keep going. Ten feet or so. All

663
00:44:36,993 --> 00:44:41,903
right. I'm going to inspect and try to do the
same. 26.

664
00:44:41,903 --> 00:44:52,013
MATT: You approach this mound and as soon as you
get close to it, you pull out your tools. You're

665
00:44:52,013 --> 00:44:58,850
not quite sure how this initially works. And as
you begin to push slightly on the dirt on one

666
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:03,220
side, you can see the other side shifts a little
bit from the weight. It's like there's something

667
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:12,088
beneath the dirt that has some sort of shifting
property to it and you gather based on the

668
00:45:12,088 --> 00:45:21,265
way it reacted there is a gas contained beneath
this. To disarm it would be difficult, but you can

669
00:45:21,348 --> 00:45:28,071
ascertain the nature of its detonation and once
again, you can mark this to not be placed.

670
00:45:28,071 --> 00:45:30,561
LIAM: Does it take the whole passage?

671
00:45:30,629 --> 00:45:34,604
MATT: It's right in the center, so it can be
bypassed if you stick directly to the right or

672
00:45:34,604 --> 00:45:39,298
left and work along the sides. Trinket may be a
little difficult to work on, but we'll make a roll

673
00:45:39,298 --> 00:45:40,198
for that.

674
00:45:40,198 --> 00:45:41,209
LAURA: Oh no!

675
00:45:41,209 --> 00:45:43,027
MATT: What could possibly go wrong?

676
00:45:43,027 --> 00:45:48,300
LIAM: All right people, we have some gas trapped
under a mound of shit up here.

677
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,389
SAM: Some gas?

678
00:45:49,389 --> 00:45:51,461
LAURA: Yeah it smells like Grog, so avoid it.

679
00:45:51,461 --> 00:45:58,919
LIAM: Something bad. I'm going to stay here, I'd
like you all to bring up the rear, and Kiki, bring

680
00:45:59,135 --> 00:46:07,338
the bear. Bring my nephew up, and I'd like
everyone to pass ahead, and my sister and I will

681
00:46:07,338 --> 00:46:09,730
get Trinket up behind you all.

682
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:14,065
TRAVIS: I have a question. How are we marking
these traps?

683
00:46:14,065 --> 00:46:20,004
LIAM: Chalk. The last one was marked with chalk.
This one I'm just standing in front of.

684
00:46:20,004 --> 00:46:26,282
TRAVIS: We're coming across a lot of these. If we
need to make a quick escape, it might be a

685
00:46:26,282 --> 00:46:27,201
problem.

686
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,421
SAM: If we're going back out the way we came in?

687
00:46:29,421 --> 00:46:30,486
TRAVIS: In a hurry.

688
00:46:30,486 --> 00:46:32,237
TALIESIN: We'll just have to remember.

689
00:46:32,237 --> 00:46:33,647
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.

690
00:46:33,647 --> 00:46:35,635
MARISHA: Hopefully, we won't be in a
hurry.

691
00:46:35,635 --> 00:46:37,985
SAM: Well we'll just have Trinket run first.

692
00:46:38,069 --> 00:46:42,340
LIAM: I'm sure you've got something in that bag of
yours that we can plop in front of this. For now,

693
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,644
let's just get past it.

694
00:46:43,644 --> 00:46:56,858
MATT: All right, so you each make your way around
this. When it comes to Trinket's side, I'll say

695
00:46:56,908 --> 00:47:00,874
for you because he'll probably need a little help
making his way across so go ahead and just make a

696
00:47:00,874 --> 00:47:05,472
dexterity check for Trinket with advantage, with
the aid from the party.

697
00:47:05,472 --> 00:47:09,581
LAURA: Okay, that's not good. Eight?

698
00:47:09,581 --> 00:47:12,121
MATT: Eight? Okay.

699
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:12,988
LIAM: Plus anything?

700
00:47:12,988 --> 00:47:13,787
LAURA: Nope!

701
00:47:13,787 --> 00:47:14,690
MARISHA: That's for Trinket?

702
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:15,433
LAURA: Yeah.

703
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:17,125
MATT: Okay, so who's helping Trinket?

704
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:21,110
LIAM: I am. We are, I assume.

705
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:22,382
TRAVIS: I'll help Trinket.

706
00:47:22,382 --> 00:47:28,546
TALIESIN: I'll also say, if this was a gas trap, I
would probably throw my mask on before passing it,

707
00:47:28,546 --> 00:47:29,792
as well.

708
00:47:29,792 --> 00:47:31,086
TRAVIS: I'll help Trinket.

709
00:47:31,086 --> 00:47:33,276
MATT: Okay, so just you, Grog?

710
00:47:33,276 --> 00:47:34,530
TRAVIS: Just me.

711
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:43,215
MATT: Okay, as everyone continues pushing forward,
you reach out, helping Trinket get along.

712
00:47:43,215 --> 00:47:49,416
Trinket's pushing up the side of the cavern, claws
scraping on the side of the wall. Foot slips,

713
00:47:49,416 --> 00:47:57,591
slams into the mound of dirt, at which point, the
mound depresses and then (explosion) bursts open

714
00:47:57,591 --> 00:48:03,362
into a 20 by 20-foot gas cloud.

715
00:48:03,362 --> 00:48:10,494
MARISHA: Can I cast Gust of Wind really quick and
push it back down the hallway?

716
00:48:10,494 --> 00:48:14,386
MATT: You can start doing that because it is a
lingering cloud effect. Regardless, I need you and

717
00:48:14,386 --> 00:48:16,734
Trinket to both make a constitution save.

718
00:48:16,734 --> 00:48:22,917
TRAVIS: Yes! 21! Nope, 20

719
00:48:22,917 --> 00:48:25,035
MATT: Laura, can you roll a constitution save for
Trinket?

720
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:28,857
LAURA: (nervous laugh) Yeah--

721
00:48:28,938 --> 00:48:30,032
TRAVIS: 17!

722
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,685
LAURA: Just regular?

723
00:48:32,685 --> 00:48:34,592
MATT: Just a regular constitution save.

724
00:48:34,592 --> 00:48:35,595
LAURA: Seven.

725
00:48:35,595 --> 00:48:43,904
MATT: Seven? Okay. You suffer six points of poison
damage, Trinket suffers 12 points of poison

726
00:48:43,904 --> 00:48:44,936
damage.

727
00:48:44,936 --> 00:48:49,610
SAM: Grog, you suffer no poison damage. We had our
meal.

728
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:50,964
TRAVIS: Heroes' Feast!

729
00:48:50,964 --> 00:48:52,337
LAURA: And Trinket ate it, too!

730
00:48:52,337 --> 00:48:54,098
MARISHA: That's true!

731
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,692
LAURA: We're immune to poison?

732
00:48:55,692 --> 00:48:57,664
MARISHA: We're immune to fear and poison.

733
00:48:57,664 --> 00:49:00,264
LAURA: (gasps) That's amazing!

734
00:49:00,264 --> 00:49:07,394
MATT: As the cloud begins to fill the area, you
breathe it in and there's that reactionary point

735
00:49:07,394 --> 00:49:12,428
of like, "Shit, get Trinket out of there!" and
then you realize the harshness of the toxin

736
00:49:12,428 --> 00:49:18,806
doesn't seem to be affecting your system. There is
some element of the "holy shit it's delicious"

737
00:49:18,806 --> 00:49:25,726
feast you guys had that is keeping the toxins at
bay from entering your system.

738
00:49:25,726 --> 00:49:28,523
TRAVIS: I spent the last few years building up an
immunity to iocane powder.

739
00:49:28,523 --> 00:49:30,256
(laughter)

740
00:49:30,256 --> 00:49:33,400
MARISHA: Also, doesn't your belt of Dwarvenkind
have something like that?

741
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,264
TRAVIS: Nope.

742
00:49:34,264 --> 00:49:37,028
MARISHA: No? Okay, never mind.

743
00:49:37,028 --> 00:49:40,597
LAURA: He just grows a beard. You have advantage
on charisma?

744
00:49:40,597 --> 00:49:43,224
TRAVIS: I have resistance against poison damage.

745
00:49:43,224 --> 00:49:45,308
LAURA: You have advantage on persuasion checks.

746
00:49:45,388 --> 00:49:46,297
TRAVIS: I know.

747
00:49:46,297 --> 00:49:47,667
LAURA: That's awesome.

748
00:49:47,667 --> 00:49:49,953
MATT: You take half poison damage whenever you do
take poison damage.

749
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:52,885
LAURA: Oh, where did Pike go?

750
00:49:52,885 --> 00:49:57,465
SAM: No Pike! The evil of this place is making it
hard to maintain her connection.

751
00:49:57,465 --> 00:49:59,488
MARISHA: I know it's hard. It's deep underground.

752
00:49:59,488 --> 00:50:01,003
LIAM: Oh!

753
00:50:01,003 --> 00:50:02,813
MARISHA: Hey!

754
00:50:02,813 --> 00:50:06,412
ASHLEY: This astral projection is very hard to
hold.

755
00:50:06,412 --> 00:50:08,197
(laughter)

756
00:50:08,197 --> 00:50:11,765
MATT: That's all right.

757
00:50:11,765 --> 00:50:13,764
TALIESIN: We live in an age of miracles and
wonders.

758
00:50:13,764 --> 00:50:16,754
MATT: So as you guys pass under this cloud, you--

759
00:50:16,754 --> 00:50:18,950
ASHLEY: The connection is just not very strong.

760
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:25,647
MATT: That's all right, it's much better now.
Keyleth, you push the toxin cloud back and hit it

761
00:50:25,716 --> 00:50:30,061
off to the side, pushing it down the same tunnel
that the acid section was. It'll take you a while

762
00:50:30,061 --> 00:50:32,757
to get it back there, but you can just leave it
lingering in the tunnel if you'd like.

763
00:50:32,757 --> 00:50:34,642
MARISHA: No, it's fine. I'll just leave it. It's
fine.

764
00:50:34,642 --> 00:50:40,063
MATT: Okay. It seems to be pervasive for now. It
may eventually fade or sink into the earth, but

765
00:50:40,063 --> 00:50:48,905
it'll take a while for that to happen. But you
move past this trap. You continue forward and the

766
00:50:48,905 --> 00:50:57,643
descent grows steadily more and more steep at this
point. What was like a relative decline has now

767
00:50:57,643 --> 00:51:02,268
gotten to the point where some of you have to get up
against the wall as you step down, not to the

768
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:06,338
point where it's slide-worthy or anything, but
enough where it gets a little precarious for those

769
00:51:06,422 --> 00:51:14,170
who don't have quite as much a grand hold on loose
earth. About five minutes of this, it evens out

770
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:20,733
though, and as it does you come to a metallic
doorway.

771
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:22,608
TRAVIS: Of course.

772
00:51:22,608 --> 00:51:24,245
LAURA: God damn doors.

773
00:51:24,245 --> 00:51:26,673
SAM: I got this.

774
00:51:26,673 --> 00:51:28,779
TRAVIS: Please just do it.

775
00:51:28,779 --> 00:51:30,511
LAURA: Inspect it for traps!

776
00:51:30,511 --> 00:51:31,744
TRAVIS: No, let him take it!

777
00:51:31,744 --> 00:51:36,166
LIAM: Why don't I look, and then Scanlan can
handle it? I'm just going to look, all right?

778
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:39,271
Yeah, 23.

779
00:51:39,271 --> 00:51:44,683
MATT: Okay. The door does not appear to be
trapped, but it is locked.

780
00:51:44,683 --> 00:51:47,136
LIAM: Well.

781
00:51:47,136 --> 00:51:48,429
LAURA: Can you pick it?

782
00:51:48,429 --> 00:51:49,670
LIAM: Probably.

783
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:51,036
TRAVIS: Metal door, right?

784
00:51:51,036 --> 00:51:52,046
MATT: Yeah.

785
00:51:52,046 --> 00:51:53,170
LIAM: Natural 20.

786
00:51:53,170 --> 00:52:00,468
MATT: All right. So, looking at the door, and the
closer you get as you bring some light source to

787
00:52:00,468 --> 00:52:09,985
it you can see the door itself is not an iron or a
slate metal, it's hammered bronze.

788
00:52:10,054 --> 00:52:14,988
The surface is semi-smooth but it does have
a bit of a warp to it from when the

789
00:52:15,061 --> 00:52:19,736
metal was originally plied and used to create this
doorway, so it has this hammered look across its

790
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:26,254
entire surface, some small rivets in the side. You
do notice that there is no handle for it but on

791
00:52:26,254 --> 00:52:32,397
the other side of the door, there is something
that is latched over it, so using your dagger, you

792
00:52:32,397 --> 00:52:39,844
manage to lift it slightly and then shove forward
through the slight edge of the door frame to the

793
00:52:39,844 --> 00:52:44,999
door itself or means to force this off of its
latch and you hear the metallic arm bang against

794
00:52:44,999 --> 00:52:48,169
the other side of the door as it falls down, and
the door pushes open slightly.

795
00:52:48,169 --> 00:52:51,757
LIAM: I look back to the group and go, it won't
open, it won't--

796
00:52:51,757 --> 00:52:54,199
(laughter)

797
00:52:54,199 --> 00:53:00,374
LIAM: I don't push it that far, only like four or
five inches just to peer through.

798
00:53:00,374 --> 00:53:07,855
MATT: Okay. That same acrid smell that has
permeated into the hallway continues into this

799
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:14,370
room, it's a little colder; the temperature in
this room is because, as you notice, looking in,

800
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:20,800
what little bit of distance you can see in this
pitch black vicinity, the entire room is made of

801
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,368
this type of hammered bronze.

802
00:53:23,368 --> 00:53:31,435
TRAVIS: Before we go in, are there any bits of
whitestone on the ground, like stuff in chunks or

803
00:53:31,435 --> 00:53:33,366
small pieces or is it pretty clean-ish?

804
00:53:33,366 --> 00:53:40,283
MATT: As you travel through here you see chunks
here and there, some of them appear to be, yeah,

805
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:43,910
nothing bigger than what you can fit in your palm.
Any of the larger pieces seem to have made their

806
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:50,400
way all the way back to the undercroft where you
guys had the ghost battle. At this point, you've

807
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,509
just seen bits and pieces that may have fallen out
of whatever carts were brought through and you do

808
00:53:53,509 --> 00:53:56,541
see grooves in the ground where like large wheeled
carts were pushed back and forth up and down this

809
00:53:56,541 --> 00:53:59,658
tunnel to carry materials to and from.

810
00:53:59,658 --> 00:54:05,109
LIAM: I pull the door a little bit shut behind me
and turn to the group and say, this is a room

811
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:12,538
made entirely of metal that presumably did not
exist five years ago. I think this is probably

812
00:54:12,538 --> 00:54:20,584
bad. Sister, dear, would you help me look? Just
from the door, please? Just look.

813
00:54:20,584 --> 00:54:22,671
TRAVIS: Scanlan, just shoot a lightning bolt in
there.

814
00:54:22,671 --> 00:54:27,017
LIAM: No, in a moment. Please. And perception
check the room from here.

815
00:54:27,017 --> 00:54:28,228
MATT: Go for it.

816
00:54:28,228 --> 00:54:32,124
LIAM: 29.

817
00:54:32,124 --> 00:54:42,495
LAURA: Oh, that's good, that's better than mine,
but not much. 23?

818
00:54:42,495 --> 00:54:43,904
TRAVIS: Question mark?

819
00:54:43,904 --> 00:54:49,511
MATT: Okay. Both glancing in what little bit of
space you have to poke through, you can see the

820
00:54:49,511 --> 00:55:00,288
room itself, it's about 80 feet across and about
50 feet wide. From the doorway, it's a slight ramp

821
00:55:00,288 --> 00:55:06,645
that leads down into an open floor area, also the
bronze metal, and then across the way another ramp

822
00:55:06,645 --> 00:55:13,519
that rises up to meet a small upper platform area.
and there appears to be a door

823
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:14,771
on the opposite side.

824
00:55:14,771 --> 00:55:22,110
LAURA: Can I do an arcana check, or something, to
see if it's magic?

825
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:27,912
MATT: If you'd like to. You'd probably have to get
a little closer into the room to check it out

826
00:55:27,912 --> 00:55:33,346
because you guys are at the outskirts of it.
You're just able to see a little bit of the edge

827
00:55:33,346 --> 00:55:34,787
of your visual distance.

828
00:55:34,787 --> 00:55:36,237
MARISHA: How big is the door?

829
00:55:36,237 --> 00:55:39,450
MATT: Looking at the door, if you open it up? It's
about two inches thick.

830
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:49,965
LIAM: Pike, Keyleth, will you come up here? We're
a little out of our depths here. This seems suspect

831
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:51,692
to me. I'd like you to both have a look.

832
00:55:51,692 --> 00:55:53,005
MARISHA: Yeah, something's going on here.

833
00:55:53,005 --> 00:55:54,496
ASHLEY: Yeah.

834
00:55:54,496 --> 00:55:58,528
MARISHA: So Pike and I are going up.

835
00:55:58,528 --> 00:55:59,815
ASHLEY: Yeah.

836
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:02,524
LAURA: Go. Tell us what's up.

837
00:56:02,524 --> 00:56:09,126
MATT: Have you guys all moved up to the door, at
least? Or are you all still back in the corridor?

838
00:56:09,126 --> 00:56:10,843
SAM and TALIESIN: I'm moving up to the door.

839
00:56:10,843 --> 00:56:12,284
LAURA: I'm stepping a little back.

840
00:56:12,284 --> 00:56:16,734
MATT: Okay. Cassandra does say, "This is as far as
I've gone down here."

841
00:56:16,734 --> 00:56:19,223
LAURA: Do you know what's on the other side?

842
00:56:19,223 --> 00:56:25,317
MATT: "I assume the project. The last time I came
here, I was following the Briarwoods at a

843
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:31,114
"distance. They went in there with a handful of
guards, and when I made it to this door, it was

844
00:56:31,114 --> 00:56:35,839
"empty on the inside. I assume they traveled
through that far door, but I have not actually

845
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,932
"been here myself. It was at that point that I was
discovered and dragged back to the castle."

846
00:56:39,932 --> 00:56:41,930
TALIESIN: Did you make it to the acid pits?

847
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:47,980
MATT: "Back that way? I saw them, from a distance.
I did not want to get too close. They're just

848
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:59,311
"larger, stone troughs that these chemicals have
been refined in, and for whatever purpose they've

849
00:56:59,311 --> 00:57:05,338
"required them, have been kept there. Dr. Ripley,
actually, was in charge of a lot of that

850
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,502
"development and creation."

851
00:57:07,502 --> 00:57:14,903
MARISHA: Percy and Cassandra, does this material
mean anything to you? The bronze? Does it keep any

852
00:57:14,903 --> 00:57:20,054
type of energy out? Why build a room out of
bronze?

853
00:57:20,054 --> 00:57:23,767
LIAM: That's a question for you, as well,
Percival.

854
00:57:23,767 --> 00:57:27,375
TALIESIN: I don't know. I would like to get a
better look. Are there markings on the walls? Is

855
00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:28,745
there any scripting?

856
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:31,357
MATT: Make a perception check.

857
00:57:31,357 --> 00:57:38,484
TALIESIN: Get that out of the way. Nine?

858
00:57:38,484 --> 00:57:46,186
MATT: Okay. As you step into the room and look
along the walls at the top of the ramp that leads

859
00:57:46,186 --> 00:57:57,918
downward, there's no discerning features that you
can glance off visually across the walls. Hammered

860
00:57:57,918 --> 00:58:05,237
bronze with bronze bars across to keep all the
various plates that were put up together. It's not

861
00:58:05,326 --> 00:58:09,016
one solid piece, it's multiple sheets that were
all bolted and put together

862
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,678
to create solid walls.

863
00:58:10,678 --> 00:58:12,130
MARISHA: And the floor is bronze?

864
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:13,728
MATT: The floor is bronze, as well.

865
00:58:13,728 --> 00:58:14,675
TALIESIN: The roof?

866
00:58:14,675 --> 00:58:19,295
MATT: The roof is not bronze. The roof is what
looks like solid whitestone.

867
00:58:19,295 --> 00:58:21,907
SAM: That don't look good.

868
00:58:21,907 --> 00:58:26,475
LIAM: Pike, Keyleth, do you make anything of
this?

869
00:58:26,475 --> 00:58:31,023
TRAVIS: Anyone want to go touch a wall?

870
00:58:31,023 --> 00:58:32,717
MARISHA: I don't even know.

871
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:34,387
LIAM: You have no knowledge of--

872
00:58:34,387 --> 00:58:42,107
MARISHA: I'm not great with magic. I'm great with
nature, and I'm not great with dungeoneering or

873
00:58:42,107 --> 00:58:48,781
anything like that, either. Can I do some sort of
nature check to see if this is a quarry that we

874
00:58:48,781 --> 00:58:50,384
just walked into?

875
00:58:50,384 --> 00:58:52,471
LAURA: A conductor?

876
00:58:52,471 --> 00:58:55,990
MARISHA: A conductor, yeah. It's not really a
nature thing, though.

877
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:59,733
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

878
00:58:59,733 --> 00:59:03,623
MARISHA: Okay. Not my forte. Oh, natural 20!

879
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,913
LAURA: That's a beautiful thing.

880
00:59:05,913 --> 00:59:10,218
MATT: Okay. This bronze-colored material, and
you're not too familiar with a lot of metals, but

881
00:59:10,218 --> 00:59:16,997
it appears to be an alloy of some kind. It would
probably be a good conductor of electricity, if

882
00:59:16,997 --> 00:59:24,245
utilized in a way, for whatever purpose you're
unable to ascertain, but this metal is not

883
00:59:24,245 --> 00:59:32,450
indigenous to this region, meaning the whole area
of Tal'Dorei. This metal is usually imported from

884
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:39,306
distant lands. It is not found or created
naturally in this area, to your knowledge.

885
00:59:39,306 --> 00:59:45,559
MARISHA: And would I gather any information on the
purpose of this room and what it's used for?

886
00:59:45,559 --> 00:59:55,602
MATT: Not with your experience, no. Gathering
about, though, as you all gather in this area and

887
00:59:55,602 --> 01:00:02,951
are looking around, you notice that the stonework
on the ceiling has two discolorations. Across the

888
01:00:02,951 --> 01:00:08,908
top of the ramp above you, there is a one-inch
discoloration, almost like there's a drawn line

889
01:00:08,908 --> 01:00:18,764
across the stone. At that height and this lack of
light, can't tell if it's just a marking or an

890
01:00:18,764 --> 01:00:23,340
actual change in material, and there's one
on the other side of the room across the way at

891
01:00:23,401 --> 01:00:25,350
the top of the other ramp.

892
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:27,191
LAURA: It's a conductor room.

893
01:00:27,191 --> 01:00:30,752
MARISHA: Oh, we're too far away to see what it's
made out of?

894
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:34,008
MATT: At this distance and in this low light, it's
hard to tell. You can see that there's a

895
01:00:34,008 --> 01:00:37,254
discoloration or change, but it is a consistent
band across the top.

896
01:00:37,254 --> 01:00:38,630
SAM: Should we send some light up there?

897
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:39,667
LAURA: How high are the ceilings?

898
01:00:39,667 --> 01:00:43,399
TRAVIS: I have darkvision at a range of 60 feet.
Can I see it?

899
01:00:43,504 --> 01:00:48,985
MATT: What darkvision is, it's very black and
white. You don't see a lot of color, and it's hard

900
01:00:48,985 --> 01:00:52,407
at this distance to make out anything. Without
feeling it or seeing it, it's hard to get

901
01:00:52,407 --> 01:00:53,425
details.

902
01:00:53,425 --> 01:00:56,089
LIAM: I checked the door, but I didn't check
anything else. Can I check the room for traps?

903
01:00:56,089 --> 01:00:57,242
MATT: Yeah, if you'd like to.

904
01:00:57,242 --> 01:01:01,063
LIAM: I would like to. Rolled a 23.

905
01:01:01,129 --> 01:01:08,458
MATT: Okay. As you descend the ramp, keeping a very
close eye on the ground around you, or are you

906
01:01:08,458 --> 01:01:10,210
just doing a visual scan?

907
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:14,175
LIAM: I'll walk up within a foot of the first line
you referenced.

908
01:01:14,175 --> 01:01:22,423
MATT: On the ceiling? Okay. Glancing about, you
don't notice any traps. You do notice in the

909
01:01:22,423 --> 01:01:29,736
center of the room, the very center of the room on
the floor there is a small variation in the color.

910
01:01:29,736 --> 01:01:38,715
You see what looks like a small almost oval-type
smooth button. Or some sort of a strange object

911
01:01:38,715 --> 01:01:40,343
that is embedded in the floor.

912
01:01:40,343 --> 01:01:42,893
LAURA: Should I try to shoot it? When none of us
are in the room?

913
01:01:42,893 --> 01:01:47,692
SAM: I would just try to-- oh yeah. That's
interesting.

914
01:01:47,692 --> 01:01:49,436
(laughter)

915
01:01:49,436 --> 01:01:54,978
LIAM: That will probably tell us what this room is
about. I worry a little about alerting people on

916
01:01:54,978 --> 01:01:59,738
the other side of the room, but it feels dangerous
to go through here.

917
01:01:59,738 --> 01:02:03,651
TRAVIS: Oh man.

918
01:02:03,651 --> 01:02:05,133
LAURA: That's true.

919
01:02:05,133 --> 01:02:08,305
MARISHA: There's no vents? There's no ventilation
shaft, there's nothing?

920
01:02:08,305 --> 01:02:12,205
TRAVIS: The roof is flat, or is it coned?

921
01:02:12,205 --> 01:02:15,619
MATT: The roof is flat from what you can tell.
It's a giant box, it's just the walls

922
01:02:15,619 --> 01:02:16,705
and the floor.

923
01:02:16,705 --> 01:02:17,826
TRAVIS: Whitestone ceiling?

924
01:02:17,826 --> 01:02:21,462
MATT: The whitestone ceiling and the rest of it is
all this bronze material with a ramp that goes

925
01:02:21,462 --> 01:02:24,855
down towards the bottom and the ramp that goes on
the other end, with the two platforms, where you

926
01:02:24,855 --> 01:02:26,852
enter and where the other door across the way is.

927
01:02:26,852 --> 01:02:29,253
LAURA: So, can we clear out and I'll try to shoot
it?

928
01:02:29,253 --> 01:02:30,373
MARISHA: Sure.

929
01:02:30,373 --> 01:02:31,454
TALIESIN: See what happens.

930
01:02:31,518 --> 01:02:34,257
LAURA: Okay. I'll do that.

931
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:39,252
MATT: So all of you step back out into the
hallway, your cluster of Percys and Cassandras.

932
01:02:39,252 --> 01:02:43,815
LIAM: I step one foot behind Cassandra Number
Two.

933
01:02:43,815 --> 01:02:50,046
MATT: All right. Go ahead and pull your arrow. You
aim carefully from just outside the doorway.

934
01:02:50,046 --> 01:02:53,289
MARISHA: You've got this.

935
01:02:53,289 --> 01:02:54,955
LAURA: Do I add my attack to it?

936
01:02:54,955 --> 01:02:56,649
MATT: Yes, you add your attack bonus.

937
01:02:56,649 --> 01:02:57,842
LAURA: 27.

938
01:02:57,842 --> 01:03:06,829
MATT: 27. So you release the arrow. Perfect hit.
On point. It strikes whatever this strange object

939
01:03:06,829 --> 01:03:11,746
is embedded in the floor. It hits and slightly
ricochets and splinters as an arrow would when it

940
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,559
hits a hard surface. No seeming reaction.

941
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:16,029
LAURA: It did nothing!

942
01:03:16,029 --> 01:03:22,209
TALIESIN: I'm going to try something. First of
all, does the construct of this at all remind me

943
01:03:22,209 --> 01:03:23,387
of anything?

944
01:03:23,387 --> 01:03:29,896
MATT: No, actually. Most of this tunnel structure
did not exist when you lived here. This has all

945
01:03:29,896 --> 01:03:36,454
been either re-discovered or created since you
left Whitestone.

946
01:03:36,454 --> 01:03:42,834
TALIESIN: I'm going to take my sword and I'm going
to go into the room and I'm going to lay my sword

947
01:03:42,834 --> 01:03:51,128
on the ground. Copper is a conductor. I'm having
that thought. I'm going to try and slide my sword

948
01:03:51,128 --> 01:03:56,918
towards the center of the room and see if I can
cause a short. With the piece of metal and get a

949
01:03:56,918 --> 01:04:00,821
positive and negative charge to hit and see if I
can get a reaction.

950
01:04:00,821 --> 01:04:08,626
MATT: All righty. As you step down to the bottom
of the slope as it meets the bottom, and there is

951
01:04:08,626 --> 01:04:14,983
an open area in the center of the floor now, about
a 20-foot area width between the two ramps. You're

952
01:04:14,983 --> 01:04:20,692
now at the bottom of the ramp. You take the sword
and you let it scatter across. And there are

953
01:04:20,692 --> 01:04:25,944
imperfections in the floor so it skips as it moves
and such and eventually slides to a stop. No

954
01:04:25,944 --> 01:04:31,431
effect. But you do get a better look at what this
thing is embedded in the floor. You not having

955
01:04:31,431 --> 01:04:34,058
darkvision, though, you would have to have a light
source for this.

956
01:04:34,058 --> 01:04:35,176
TALIESIN: I had a torch.

957
01:04:35,176 --> 01:04:39,934
MATT: Yeah. You bring your torch forward and you
look over. It looks like a smooth gem, like an

958
01:04:39,934 --> 01:04:46,080
opal or some sort of whitish opaque gem that is
embedded in the ground in the center.

959
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:49,486
LAURA: The Arkenstone! Definitely.

960
01:04:49,486 --> 01:04:51,017
(laughter)

961
01:04:51,017 --> 01:04:55,513
TALIESIN: And it's not translucent? It's like an
opal-like stone?

962
01:04:55,513 --> 01:05:00,810
MATT: It's an opal-like stone, about that big that
is embedded in the bronze floor. There's actually

963
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:07,138
a small, metal bronze band that encases it, wraps
around it that-- It wasn't just pressed into it; it

964
01:05:07,214 --> 01:05:09,496
was put there intentionally.

965
01:05:09,496 --> 01:05:11,120
TRAVIS: I say we smash it!

966
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,511
TALIESIN: I say we remove it, at the very least.
See what happens.

967
01:05:13,511 --> 01:05:15,389
LAURA: Can you disarm it?

968
01:05:15,389 --> 01:05:17,196
MARISHA: All of those sound like bad ideas.

969
01:05:17,196 --> 01:05:18,261
SAM: Terrible.

970
01:05:18,261 --> 01:05:19,728
TALIESIN: Does anybody have a good idea?

971
01:05:19,728 --> 01:05:21,024
SAM: Why don't we just walk past it?

972
01:05:21,115 --> 01:05:22,947
MARISHA: I'm with Scanlan. I say we just go.

973
01:05:22,947 --> 01:05:28,071
TALIESIN: In the absence of good ideas, bad ideas,
I think, are always reasonable.

974
01:05:28,071 --> 01:05:31,602
MARISHA: But maybe mine and Scanlan's is a good
idea.

975
01:05:31,602 --> 01:05:34,928
LAURA: Maybe just try to get through the room.
Some of us stay on one side, some other people go

976
01:05:34,928 --> 01:05:36,921
through and see what happens to the first person.

977
01:05:36,921 --> 01:05:43,587
LIAM: So long as you all will pick me up off the
floor, I would like to skirt the entire side of

978
01:05:43,587 --> 01:05:44,425
the room.

979
01:05:44,425 --> 01:05:45,626
LAURA: And just go through the other door?

980
01:05:45,626 --> 01:05:47,038
LIAM: See if I can make it to the other door.

981
01:05:47,038 --> 01:05:47,943
MATT: All right.

982
01:05:47,943 --> 01:05:52,184
LIAM: Please help me if I fall down. And I start
along.

983
01:05:52,184 --> 01:05:53,433
TRAVIS: After a good giggle.

984
01:05:53,433 --> 01:05:59,458
MATT: As the floor ramps down towards the center,
you follow it along the wall. Making your way

985
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:05,982
across, looking. You notice as you go across the
wall, there are three more of these same opal

986
01:06:05,982 --> 01:06:08,058
stones embedded in the wall about shoulder
height.

987
01:06:08,058 --> 01:06:09,036
LIAM: In the wall?

988
01:06:09,036 --> 01:06:10,412
MATT: In the wall as you go across.

989
01:06:10,412 --> 01:06:12,740
LIAM: Is it one in the middle and then one in the
center of each wall?

990
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:14,484
MATT: On just on your wall--

991
01:06:14,484 --> 01:06:15,664
LIAM: Just on my wall?

992
01:06:15,664 --> 01:06:19,081
MATT: Just on your wall, there's three along the
way. There's one in the center of the room in line

993
01:06:19,081 --> 01:06:23,612
with the central opal, and there's two to the
sides of it about four feet from each other.

994
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:27,798
LIAM: I've gone into a crouch, so I'm very low,
butt dragging along the floor and just sort of--

995
01:06:27,798 --> 01:06:30,561
MATT: So you notice that. You skirt underneath.

996
01:06:30,561 --> 01:06:32,474
LIAM: Leaning my back against the wall.

997
01:06:32,474 --> 01:06:37,546
MATT: Okay. They pass overhead. As you make your
way underneath the three opals in this part of the

998
01:06:37,546 --> 01:06:41,090
wall. Making your way up the other ramp to the
other side.

999
01:06:41,090 --> 01:06:42,360
LIAM: Continued perception check?

1000
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,866
MATT: Make a perception check.

1001
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:47,390
LIAM: Yeah. 23.

1002
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:55,665
MATT: Okay. You make your way up this side looking
about on the floor. Nothing seems to happen,

1003
01:06:55,665 --> 01:07:02,059
nothing catches your eye. You get onto this upper
platform, and there is the door there

1004
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:03,554
in front of you.

1005
01:07:03,554 --> 01:07:08,769
LIAM: I check for traps on the door. That is a
24.

1006
01:07:08,769 --> 01:07:12,916
MATT: The door does not appear to be trapped.

1007
01:07:12,916 --> 01:07:14,008
LIAM: Or locked?

1008
01:07:14,008 --> 01:07:18,965
MATT: Does not appear to be locked. It does not
seem to have a mechanism for opening other than if

1009
01:07:18,965 --> 01:07:20,466
you wanted to try and push.

1010
01:07:20,466 --> 01:07:21,647
TRAVIS: Go through it!

1011
01:07:21,647 --> 01:07:29,850
SAM: No, let's get out of here. They wouldn't
build a huge bronze trap room within their castle.

1012
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:36,112
No, they've lived here in peace for five years.
What would they need this for? This has some sort

1013
01:07:36,112 --> 01:07:38,633
of use for their magic. This is not a trap room.

1014
01:07:38,633 --> 01:07:42,669
TRAVIS: We should try to remove one of the
stones.

1015
01:07:42,669 --> 01:07:48,685
MARISHA: Question. Are the stones mathematically
adjacent to each other?

1016
01:07:48,685 --> 01:07:51,270
Do they appear to be lined up?

1017
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:55,548
MATT: Well as you can tell, there's the one in the
center of the middle of the floor. Then there's

1018
01:07:55,548 --> 01:08:03,430
one on the wall that he walked across, and as you
to the other wall, there are another

1019
01:08:03,497 --> 01:08:05,420
matching set of three on both walls.

1020
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:06,546
MARISHA: And they're all lined up.

1021
01:08:06,546 --> 01:08:08,967
MATT: And they're all lined up. There's the two in
the center of the room that match the one in the

1022
01:08:08,967 --> 01:08:11,829
floor and then there's one to each side of that
about four feet apart.

1023
01:08:11,829 --> 01:08:14,178
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to walk in a little bit.
Are there any on the ceiling?

1024
01:08:14,178 --> 01:08:19,425
MATT: Looking up. Make a perception check.

1025
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:21,043
MARISHA: Natural one.

1026
01:08:21,043 --> 01:08:23,928
MATT: You get lost in the beauty of the
structure.

1027
01:08:23,928 --> 01:08:25,361
(laughter)

1028
01:08:25,361 --> 01:08:27,329
TALIESIN: I was going to look to see if there was
one matching the one on the floor.

1029
01:08:27,329 --> 01:08:28,346
MATT: Okay.

1030
01:08:28,346 --> 01:08:30,324
MARISHA: That's good metal! Good craftsmanship,
damn.

1031
01:08:30,324 --> 01:08:33,872
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's good, that's a 27.

1032
01:08:33,961 --> 01:08:43,348
MATT: Looking up, no. The ceiling is just smooth
whitestone. You, pushing the door-- it doesn't

1033
01:08:43,437 --> 01:08:52,617
open. It is solid stone, and as you push and look,
you can see there's no hinges. Looking at where it

1034
01:08:52,617 --> 01:08:58,859
meets the wall, it looks like it slid down into a
groove. It's actually a door that would lift or

1035
01:08:58,859 --> 01:09:03,574
sink. It slides. Some way, shape, or form, it
slides into place.

1036
01:09:03,574 --> 01:09:07,743
LIAM: Grog doesn't have an earring, does he?

1037
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:08,873
TRAVIS: Yeah, I do.

1038
01:09:08,873 --> 01:09:12,284
MARISHA: I think we all have earrings right now.

1039
01:09:12,284 --> 01:09:13,415
LIAM: Grog?

1040
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:15,988
LAURA: He's right there! Just fucking talk to
him.

1041
01:09:15,988 --> 01:09:21,948
LIAM: He's across an 80-foot room! I'm not going
to shout down here. There's a big heavy thing.

1042
01:09:21,948 --> 01:09:23,137
TRAVIS: Yeah?

1043
01:09:23,137 --> 01:09:26,422
LIAM: And you're the best you are at what you do.
Do you think you could shimmy along on your tummy,

1044
01:09:26,422 --> 01:09:32,300
along a side wall? Don't stand up because there's
gems in the walls along the way and I don't know

1045
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:37,287
what they do, so stay low, please? And come meet
me up here.

1046
01:09:37,287 --> 01:09:43,328
TRAVIS: I just kinda want to walk across the room.

1047
01:09:43,392 --> 01:09:44,568
LAURA: Do it.

1048
01:09:44,568 --> 01:09:45,617
TRAVIS: I walk across the room.

1049
01:09:45,617 --> 01:09:52,208
MATT: Okay. So you watch in horror as Grog just
strolls full, upright back, hammer in his arm with

1050
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:58,475
a big grin on his face. Looking like a really
burly Percy. I have to keep reminding myself. It's

1051
01:09:58,475 --> 01:10:00,574
a very curious visual every time.

1052
01:10:00,574 --> 01:10:02,276
TRAVIS: I adjust my amazing spectacles.

1053
01:10:02,276 --> 01:10:06,102
MATT: Passes right through the center of where
these opals are aligned across from each other.

1054
01:10:06,102 --> 01:10:11,903
Seeming no effect. Makes his way up the ramp to
where you are on the opposite side of the room.

1055
01:10:11,903 --> 01:10:13,727
TALIESIN: I'm going to go get my sword.

1056
01:10:13,727 --> 01:10:22,049
MARISHA: Well, hang on, while Grog goes and lifts
the thing. While Grog does that, do I have any

1057
01:10:22,049 --> 01:10:26,676
idea where we are geographically in the city,
underground?

1058
01:10:26,676 --> 01:10:34,387
MATT: Keeping track best you can, you gather
you're about a quarter-mile from the center of the

1059
01:10:34,387 --> 01:10:39,546
city, from the square where the Sun Tree is. It's
a quarter-mile south of you.

1060
01:10:39,546 --> 01:10:41,311
MARISHA: So probably not under the Sun Tree.

1061
01:10:41,311 --> 01:10:42,399
MATT: Currently, no.

1062
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:43,348
MARISHA: Okay.

1063
01:10:43,348 --> 01:10:47,455
TRAVIS: Walking up to the door, does it look like
I can get any purchase with my little

1064
01:10:47,455 --> 01:10:48,485
finger-bits?

1065
01:10:48,485 --> 01:10:50,056
MATT: Nope. It is flush with the ground.

1066
01:10:50,056 --> 01:10:52,996
TRAVIS: I have a pickaxe that I picked up before
we left.

1067
01:10:52,996 --> 01:10:54,011
MATT: Okay.

1068
01:10:54,011 --> 01:10:57,844
TRAVIS: Can I swing it at the bottom and try and
find some purchase under the door?

1069
01:10:57,844 --> 01:11:07,406
MATT: You could try. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead and
roll an athletics check to see if you can manage

1070
01:11:07,406 --> 01:11:09,255
to get anything in there.

1071
01:11:09,255 --> 01:11:12,384
TRAVIS: Okay. 16?

1072
01:11:12,384 --> 01:11:17,752
MATT: 16? Okay, so you take it and you try to get
a few whacks in, it's not really getting in there.

1073
01:11:17,752 --> 01:11:19,425
Make a strength check.

1074
01:11:19,425 --> 01:11:25,573
TRAVIS: Shit. Fuck. Nine?

1075
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:33,717
MATT: Nine? You swing with the pickaxe downward
for a full angry Grog-swing, and as you hit, you

1076
01:11:33,717 --> 01:11:39,196
feel the pickaxe move further than it did before,
and for a split-second your brain's like, great!

1077
01:11:39,196 --> 01:11:42,462
And then you look down and notice that the actual
handle of the pickaxe has shattered from the

1078
01:11:42,462 --> 01:11:44,372
impact, broken in two.

1079
01:11:44,372 --> 01:11:46,685
TALIESIN: We're not thinking about this clearly.

1080
01:11:46,685 --> 01:11:48,450
TRAVIS: Thinking?

1081
01:11:48,450 --> 01:11:53,604
SAM: We've been beaten by doors before, but
goddamn it, we're not going to be beaten today. I

1082
01:11:53,604 --> 01:11:59,581
go to the center of the room and I find that
little button thing and I'm going to press it.

1083
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:00,674
TALIESIN: Good.

1084
01:12:00,674 --> 01:12:05,947
MATT: Okay. You go and press your thumb down on
it. It doesn't move, it doesn't shift. It doesn't

1085
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:11,518
give way at all, it just stays in place. As you
pull your thumb away, though, you notice that the

1086
01:12:11,518 --> 01:12:16,314
gem has a very soft, faint white glow to it, and a
second after you pull your thumb

1087
01:12:16,314 --> 01:12:17,575
away it fades back.

1088
01:12:17,575 --> 01:12:19,870
TALIESIN: I walk over to the wall and touch one of
the other gems.

1089
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:20,919
LAURA: I touch another one.

1090
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:22,346
MARISHA: I touch another one!

1091
01:12:22,346 --> 01:12:26,492
MATT: You guys all place your hands against the
opals on the sides, and checking as you pull your

1092
01:12:26,492 --> 01:12:30,240
hand away, the opals glow brightly white again,
and then fade.

1093
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,448
MARISHA: Pike.

1094
01:12:31,448 --> 01:12:33,727
TRAVIS: I am Captain Planet. No.

1095
01:12:33,727 --> 01:12:35,546
LAURA: Touch one of the stones, Grog.

1096
01:12:35,546 --> 01:12:37,028
TRAVIS: I run over and touch a stone.

1097
01:12:37,028 --> 01:12:38,265
LIAM: I touch one, too.

1098
01:12:38,265 --> 01:12:43,883
MATT: (laughs) All right, so that's three on one
side, three on the other, who's got the middle

1099
01:12:43,883 --> 01:12:45,516
one? You got the middle one?

1100
01:12:45,516 --> 01:12:46,666
SAM: I'm in the middle.

1101
01:12:46,666 --> 01:12:47,495
ASHLEY: I got one.

1102
01:12:47,495 --> 01:12:48,525
LAURA: Trinket.

1103
01:12:48,525 --> 01:12:51,978
SAM: Yeah, can Trinket touch a stone? Or
Cassandra. Cassandra, make yourself useful for

1104
01:12:51,978 --> 01:12:53,133
Christ's sake.

1105
01:12:53,133 --> 01:12:54,808
LIAM: Who's Christ?

1106
01:12:54,978 --> 01:12:59,343
SAM: My friend back in Gnomolia, where I'm from.

1107
01:12:59,409 --> 01:13:01,420
MATT: Pike, are you grabbing a stone or not?

1108
01:13:01,574 --> 01:13:02,663
ASHLEY: What was that?

1109
01:13:02,663 --> 01:13:04,074
MATT: Are you touching a stone or not?

1110
01:13:04,074 --> 01:13:05,115
ASHLEY: Yes, I am.

1111
01:13:05,115 --> 01:13:12,409
MATT: Okay. That's seven. So three on one side,
three on the other, Trinket keeping there with

1112
01:13:12,409 --> 01:13:20,046
anticipation up next to you. Pike, you put your
hand on the final stone. A moment passes.

1113
01:13:20,046 --> 01:13:22,929
LAURA: This is totally going to work.

1114
01:13:22,929 --> 01:13:24,214
MARISHA: Come on, guys.

1115
01:13:24,214 --> 01:13:26,151
MATT: Doesn't seem to have an immediate effect.

1116
01:13:26,151 --> 01:13:27,203
SAM: Wait.

1117
01:13:27,203 --> 01:13:31,668
MARISHA: No, maybe if we all think about the
strength of our friendship and bond together.

1118
01:13:31,668 --> 01:13:34,513
LIAM: This is our time now!

1119
01:13:34,513 --> 01:13:39,948
SAM: Hold on, as much as I love Pike, you aren't a
real person right now.

1120
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:42,308
Maybe we should swap out Pike.

1121
01:13:42,308 --> 01:13:46,685
MATT: Yeah, Pike, as you pull your hand away, the
stone is glowing. And it fades momentarily after

1122
01:13:46,685 --> 01:13:47,634
you put your hand there.

1123
01:13:47,634 --> 01:13:49,410
SAM: Oh, it does work. Never mind, Pike. I love
you.

1124
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:50,549
ASHLEY: But are there any on the ceiling?

1125
01:13:50,549 --> 01:13:52,012
MATT: Nothing on the ceiling.

1126
01:13:52,012 --> 01:13:53,466
LAURA: Do we see any missing ones?

1127
01:13:53,466 --> 01:13:56,099
MATT: Roll a perception check.

1128
01:13:56,099 --> 01:14:02,621
LAURA: 21.

1129
01:14:02,621 --> 01:14:10,278
MATT: 21. Okay. Looking about, Cassandra actually,
who's up towards the far ramp, seems to notice

1130
01:14:10,278 --> 01:14:14,410
something and walks up to where the door is,
looking at the foot of the door. She moves her

1131
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:18,608
hand out of the way and presses her hand down on a
hidden eighth opal.

1132
01:14:18,608 --> 01:14:19,952
LAURA: Nice!

1133
01:14:19,952 --> 01:14:25,738
MATT: At which point there's a shift, a sound of
stone shifting loudly, and those bars across the

1134
01:14:25,738 --> 01:14:37,558
ceiling, the green bars? Let loose a bit of dust,
and two large walls of green glass (impact noise)

1135
01:14:37,558 --> 01:14:43,348
slam downward to the front and back of you,
locking all seven of you into the center of this

1136
01:14:43,415 --> 01:14:44,803
bronze room.

1137
01:14:44,803 --> 01:14:46,172
LIAM: Where's Cassandra?

1138
01:14:46,172 --> 01:14:51,071
MATT: Cassandra's on the other side of the green
wall on the far end of the room.

1139
01:14:51,071 --> 01:14:54,838
MARISHA: Can we hear each other through the
glass?

1140
01:14:54,838 --> 01:15:00,273
MATT: Cassandra runs up to the glass and puts her
hands to it, and you can hear her voice saying,

1141
01:15:00,273 --> 01:15:02,483
"Is everyone all right?"

1142
01:15:02,483 --> 01:15:03,957
LAURA: Is she on the other side of it?

1143
01:15:03,957 --> 01:15:09,519
MATT: She went up to the far platform. Which, by
the way, you notice immediately, this glass, this

1144
01:15:09,519 --> 01:15:15,503
weird, warped glass that forms these walls is the
same material as the shards of green glass

1145
01:15:15,534 --> 01:15:18,485
that you found broken on parts of the ground in
the Undercroft.

1146
01:15:18,485 --> 01:15:20,765
SAM: Grog, can you hit it?

1147
01:15:20,765 --> 01:15:23,759
TRAVIS: Yeah. Anybody have any objections?

1148
01:15:23,759 --> 01:15:24,809
ALL: No.

1149
01:15:24,809 --> 01:15:26,222
TRAVIS: I swing away.

1150
01:15:26,222 --> 01:15:32,724
MATT: Okay. Cassandra takes a step back, go ahead
and roll for an attack.

1151
01:15:32,724 --> 01:15:34,595
LAURA: Is the door opening behind her?

1152
01:15:34,595 --> 01:15:36,877
MATT: The door is opening, actually, behind her.

1153
01:15:36,877 --> 01:15:38,368
TRAVIS: 19.

1154
01:15:38,368 --> 01:15:42,701
MATT: 19? You go ahead and you strike forward. Go
ahead and roll damage.

1155
01:15:42,701 --> 01:15:50,685
TRAVIS: 16.

1156
01:15:50,685 --> 01:15:56,723
MATT: 16. Okay. You strike with all your might
across the front of the glass, Cassandra steps

1157
01:15:56,723 --> 01:16:02,778
back as the might of it hits. A streak of green
sparks fly off the edge of the blade as it careens

1158
01:16:02,778 --> 01:16:11,645
across the front and goes (metal noises) leaving
bare but a scratch across the stone. At this

1159
01:16:11,645 --> 01:16:15,645
point, you guys see the door opening behind
Cassandra, and two figures step in behind her.

1160
01:16:15,645 --> 01:16:16,900
LAURA: Goddamn it.

1161
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:20,217
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and cast
Thunderwave. Maybe this shit can only be taken

1162
01:16:20,217 --> 01:16:21,223
down with magic.

1163
01:16:21,223 --> 01:16:22,852
SAM: Wait, but are you going to hurt us?

1164
01:16:22,852 --> 01:16:26,189
LAURA: I dip my arrows in holy oil. Three of
them.

1165
01:16:26,189 --> 01:16:31,510
MARISHA: No, it's just a push spell, but it's
radiant damage thing. But you guys

1166
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:32,747
are behind the glass.

1167
01:16:32,747 --> 01:16:33,927
TRAVIS: We're all in the glass.

1168
01:16:33,927 --> 01:16:35,015
LAURA: We're all in the glass.

1169
01:16:35,015 --> 01:16:36,238
TRAVIS: No, we're in a closed space.

1170
01:16:36,238 --> 01:16:38,116
SAM: We're all going to get hit by what you're
doing.

1171
01:16:38,116 --> 01:16:42,024
MARISHA: Well, if it breaks the glass, we won't be
separated by glass.

1172
01:16:42,024 --> 01:16:43,809
TRAVIS: Might as well die one way or another.

1173
01:16:43,809 --> 01:16:46,327
MARISHA: You wanted me to try and get us--

1174
01:16:46,327 --> 01:16:47,501
LAURA: Just do it.

1175
01:16:47,501 --> 01:16:55,214
LIAM: While all this is happening, I pull the vial
of poison that I traded from that hag and start to

1176
01:16:55,214 --> 01:16:58,710
drip it down onto my blade of life-stealing behind
the group.

1177
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:03,003
MATT: Okay. As you guys all gather back and up at
this point, Grog, I don't know if you're still

1178
01:17:03,003 --> 01:17:03,993
swinging?

1179
01:17:03,993 --> 01:17:05,448
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, I'm just (angry noises).

1180
01:17:05,448 --> 01:17:11,223
MATT: As this is happening, are you preparing
Thunderwave? You said you wanted to try?

1181
01:17:11,223 --> 01:17:13,847
LAURA: Do it. You said you wanted to do it, just
do it.

1182
01:17:13,847 --> 01:17:18,001
MARISHA: All right. I take my staff, crack it
down, cast Thunderwave.

1183
01:17:18,001 --> 01:17:19,649
See if I can shatter this glass.

1184
01:17:19,649 --> 01:17:25,457
MATT: With a loud sound-blast echoing through the
room, you can hear the reverberation of the actual

1185
01:17:25,457 --> 01:17:31,617
bronze material sending back the vibrations of
this spell. All of you who weren't covering your

1186
01:17:31,617 --> 01:17:36,250
ears very heartily, it still creeps through and
rings your head a little bit. As the blast hits

1187
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:42,563
the glass, it seems to have no effect. The actual
essence of the spell itself is scattered across

1188
01:17:42,563 --> 01:17:50,577
its surface. This residuum-sealed green glass. The
two figures step into what little bit of light is

1189
01:17:50,577 --> 01:17:58,356
now visible from Percy's torch that is twisted
through the warped surface of this glass wall, and

1190
01:17:58,356 --> 01:18:03,825
you see before you Lord and Lady Briarwood
stepping up to the wall, looking through, their

1191
01:18:03,825 --> 01:18:08,272
warped visage through the glass looking down into
the chamber that you're all currently locked in.

1192
01:18:08,272 --> 01:18:14,672
LAURA: Oh, is this your room? I didn't even
realize we were in your house right now. How good

1193
01:18:14,672 --> 01:18:16,664
to see you again, darling.

1194
01:18:16,664 --> 01:18:23,586
MATT: Sylas leans forward and puts his hand to the
glass and says, "And hello to you, too. And

1195
01:18:23,586 --> 01:18:28,591
"welcome to all of you. Well, my dear."

1196
01:18:28,591 --> 01:18:35,394
At which point Delilah steps forward and goes, "I
was hoping for a more formal reunion, but you

1197
01:18:35,394 --> 01:18:40,217
"insisted on riling up the populace and tying up
the bulk of our forces.

1198
01:18:40,217 --> 01:18:42,824
"Rather unfortunate, really."

1199
01:18:42,824 --> 01:18:52,665
LIAM: Now, the door's open behind them, right? If
I use perception, do I see anything behind them,

1200
01:18:52,665 --> 01:18:56,465
any switch or lever or anything?

1201
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:59,036
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

1202
01:18:59,036 --> 01:19:00,310
LIAM: 20.

1203
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:06,812
MATT: 20. Looking across the way, but barely able
to peer past them with very little light in the

1204
01:19:06,812 --> 01:19:18,923
distortion of the glass, you can see what seems to
be some sort of a smooth stone placard that's

1205
01:19:18,923 --> 01:19:21,746
embedded in the wall just on the other side of the
door.

1206
01:19:21,746 --> 01:19:23,544
LIAM: Just outside the door.

1207
01:19:23,544 --> 01:19:24,678
MATT: Yeah.

1208
01:19:24,678 --> 01:19:33,498
LIAM: Then I pull the cape around me and I
Dimension Door.

1209
01:19:33,498 --> 01:19:35,286
SAM: What!

1210
01:19:35,286 --> 01:19:41,386
LIAM: Outside that door, right by the placard, and
jam my hand on that.

1211
01:19:41,386 --> 01:19:43,033
MATT: Okay.

1212
01:19:43,033 --> 01:19:44,678
SAM: You can do that?

1213
01:19:44,678 --> 01:19:53,286
MATT: You, all of a sudden, vanish from that room,
and you press your hand into that placard. You can

1214
01:19:53,286 --> 01:20:00,493
notice, Sylas looks over his shoulder with a
slight look of unexpected surprise. The smile's

1215
01:20:00,493 --> 01:20:02,156
still across his face.

1216
01:20:02,156 --> 01:20:04,209
MARISHA: Can I go ahead and start conjuring
Sunbeam?

1217
01:20:04,209 --> 01:20:09,908
MATT: That's if you want to. It's a spell that you
do as you do it.

1218
01:20:09,908 --> 01:20:11,650
You can't really hold it in place.

1219
01:20:11,650 --> 01:20:12,568
MARISHA: Okay.

1220
01:20:12,568 --> 01:20:13,804
MATT: You pressed the platform in--

1221
01:20:13,804 --> 01:20:15,040
(Skype noise)

1222
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,599
MARISHA: No!

1223
01:20:16,599 --> 01:20:18,149
TRAVIS: Keep going.

1224
01:20:18,149 --> 01:20:30,325
MATT: As you push in, there's a sound of grinding
stone again. However, the walls stay in place. Two

1225
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:38,120
of the highest bronze plates that are pressed
against the wall shift inside and move out of the

1226
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:46,680
way. And two big tubes push outward. Sylas looks
over his shoulder and says, "Well, I was not

1227
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:52,533
"expecting you to want to see your friends
dissolved quite so quickly, but certainly."

1228
01:20:52,533 --> 01:20:55,498
LAURA: Oh my god, we're going to die.

1229
01:20:55,498 --> 01:21:01,112
MATT: As you guys look up, this green viscous
liquid begins to pour--

1230
01:21:01,112 --> 01:21:05,986
TALIESIN: I stop, I pull out the gun, and the
second those hit-- I've seen this coming, because

1231
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:14,266
fucking copper room, fucking acid. Ice shot to the
one tube, do my best to reload as quickly as I can

1232
01:21:14,266 --> 01:21:17,501
and ice shot to the other. I'm going to try and
clog them with ice, at least temporarily.

1233
01:21:17,501 --> 01:21:21,052
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make your first shot.

1234
01:21:21,052 --> 01:21:29,444
TALIESIN: That's 15. 27.

1235
01:21:29,444 --> 01:21:31,533
MATT: 27. Okay.

1236
01:21:31,533 --> 01:21:44,359
TALIESIN: To hit. And that's ten plus three points
of ice damage.

1237
01:21:44,359 --> 01:21:53,418
MATT: Okay. The bullet slams into the bottom of
this tube, and the tube itself is not made of any

1238
01:21:53,418 --> 01:21:58,588
real thick material; it's a similar material to
the bronze the rest of this room is constructed

1239
01:21:58,588 --> 01:22:03,867
in, and it seems like it's brought in by some sort
of mechanism that locks into place. As the bullet

1240
01:22:03,867 --> 01:22:08,106
strikes the bottom of it, it bends upward, closing
off part of its passageway, and locking off the

1241
01:22:08,106 --> 01:22:16,592
other half with ice, seemingly holding it for the
time being. While you're reloading, I need you to

1242
01:22:16,592 --> 01:22:19,006
go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.

1243
01:22:19,006 --> 01:22:20,052
LIAM: I have advantage.

1244
01:22:20,052 --> 01:22:21,389
MATT: You do.

1245
01:22:21,389 --> 01:22:25,083
TRAVIS: What about these jewels?

1246
01:22:25,083 --> 01:22:26,719
MATT: The Feast gives you advantage.

1247
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:32,000
LIAM: The Feast gives me advantage, well, but it
doesn't stack, right? I rolled a 16.

1248
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,102
MATT: You rolled a 16? All right.

1249
01:22:36,102 --> 01:22:38,287
TALIESIN: It was a good thought.

1250
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:44,835
MATT: As you pull your hand out of the switch,
Sylas's gaze pierces into your eyes, and your

1251
01:22:44,835 --> 01:22:52,501
blades, before you have a moment to notice, have
already sheathed themselves, and you step into the

1252
01:22:52,501 --> 01:22:54,741
room alongside the two of them.

1253
01:22:54,741 --> 01:22:59,763
TRAVIS: The jewels! It was what lowered the glass.
Break the jewels!

1254
01:22:59,763 --> 01:23:05,325
MATT: Sylas comes and pats you on the shoulder and
goes, "However, it doesn't hurt to have friends.

1255
01:23:05,325 --> 01:23:12,627
"Thankfully, we were ahead of our residuum
production schedule, and, well, a few minor

1256
01:23:12,627 --> 01:23:16,602
"modifications to our distillery room made an
excellent trap for you."

1257
01:23:16,602 --> 01:23:23,341
Delilah turns to him and says, "Bit
unceremonious, but I'm not in the mood to break a

1258
01:23:23,406 --> 01:23:31,599
"sweat today. We're still weeks off from being
ready, and I have much work to do." At which

1259
01:23:31,599 --> 01:23:34,251
point, they both look over and put their hands on
Cassandra. Cassandra's still standing there

1260
01:23:34,251 --> 01:23:44,218
staring at the room with a look of coldness mixed
with this brimming sense of desperation and worry.

1261
01:23:44,218 --> 01:23:49,724
There's this crux moment in her where there's this
inner conflict within her right now.

1262
01:23:49,724 --> 01:23:55,152
TRAVIS: Can I take a swing at the jewel that I was
holding my hand over?

1263
01:23:55,152 --> 01:23:56,477
TALIESIN: I want to get my second.

1264
01:23:56,477 --> 01:23:58,459
MATT: Quickly, he's going to get his next shot
here.

1265
01:23:58,459 --> 01:24:03,749
TALIESIN: Reload, second shot. 15?

1266
01:24:03,826 --> 01:24:11,505
MATT: 15. As you fire the second, it ricochets off
the bronze nearby. The liquid begins to pour in

1267
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:18,293
now. One side is currently held, but the other
half spills and begins cascading into the room.

1268
01:24:18,293 --> 01:24:21,436
LAURA: I drink my Potion of Flying that I took
from Ripley.

1269
01:24:21,436 --> 01:24:26,345
MATT: Okay, you chug a Potion of Flying, and you
begin lifting off the ground. The rest of you, you

1270
01:24:26,345 --> 01:24:34,997
do have these two ramps that push up at least five
feet towards where these glass walls are, but the

1271
01:24:34,997 --> 01:24:38,035
bottom of this entire room is beginning to fill
with this liquid.

1272
01:24:38,035 --> 01:24:46,065
MARISHA: Can I go ahead and on my-- I'm assuming I
have spigots in my room? We're each in individual

1273
01:24:46,065 --> 01:24:47,517
rooms with our own spigots?

1274
01:24:47,517 --> 01:24:50,150
MATT: No, you're all in the same room, sealed
by two walls.

1275
01:24:50,150 --> 01:24:53,814
LAURA: That's why the Thunderwave hit us all,
because we're all in one giant room together.

1276
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:54,891
MARISHA: Okay.

1277
01:24:54,891 --> 01:24:57,114
TALIESIN: And all the gems are in our room,
correct?

1278
01:24:57,114 --> 01:24:59,846
MATT: Correct, yes. All the gems except for the
one that Cassandra touched.

1279
01:24:59,846 --> 01:25:00,850
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1280
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:02,112
TRAVIS: Can I hit the fucking jewel?

1281
01:25:02,112 --> 01:25:02,938
LAURA: Do it!

1282
01:25:02,938 --> 01:25:03,860
SAM: Yeah, do it.

1283
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:04,644
TRAVIS: Can I try?

1284
01:25:04,644 --> 01:25:05,846
MATT: Yep.

1285
01:25:05,846 --> 01:25:06,964
TRAVIS: 18.

1286
01:25:06,964 --> 01:25:11,566
MATT: Okay. You reach down and strike the gem. Go
ahead and roll damage.

1287
01:25:11,566 --> 01:25:18,247
TRAVIS: No fire damage, so 15.

1288
01:25:18,247 --> 01:25:23,635
MATT: 15, okay. You strike the gem as hard as you
can, you can see it crack a little bit from the

1289
01:25:23,635 --> 01:25:31,097
impact. The actual gem itself has a small crack
run through its center. Are you guys all currently

1290
01:25:31,097 --> 01:25:34,660
at the top of the ramps?

1291
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:37,257
LAURA: We're backing up to where we're not in the
middle of the acid.

1292
01:25:37,257 --> 01:25:42,003
MATT: Is what I'm asking, yeah. Trinket's backed
up awkwardly against the back, looking really

1293
01:25:42,003 --> 01:25:48,180
uncomfortable. Cassandra puts her hand up to the
wall, and looks at the group of you and says,

1294
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:50,219
"Which one is my Percy?"

1295
01:25:50,219 --> 01:26:03,224
TALIESIN: I walk up, I look at her, and I smile.
It's all right. See you soon. And going to go

1296
01:26:03,224 --> 01:26:08,223
right into pulling out the gun and preparing.

1297
01:26:08,223 --> 01:26:10,077
LAURA: Preparing what?

1298
01:26:10,077 --> 01:26:12,165
TALIESIN: We're going to take out these gems.

1299
01:26:12,165 --> 01:26:13,271
LAURA: Okay.

1300
01:26:13,271 --> 01:26:15,031
TALIESIN: We're going to be fine, but we have to
do it now.

1301
01:26:15,031 --> 01:26:18,930
MARISHA: While they take out the gems, these
earrings work telepathically, right?

1302
01:26:18,930 --> 01:26:21,577
MATT: No, you actually talk into them and it
happens.

1303
01:26:21,577 --> 01:26:27,507
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to back into the corridor
while you guys handle the gems and start talking

1304
01:26:27,507 --> 01:26:28,447
to Vax.

1305
01:26:28,447 --> 01:26:29,841
MATT: There's no corridor. You're inside.

1306
01:26:29,841 --> 01:26:31,322
MARISHA: Or the ramp, whatever.

1307
01:26:31,322 --> 01:26:36,219
MATT: Okay, you're backing up on the ramp. As
you're doing that.

1308
01:26:36,219 --> 01:26:38,470
TALIESIN: I'm going to be fine. Go.

1309
01:26:38,470 --> 01:26:42,262
MATT: She leans forward with her hand on the wall
and looks at you in the eyes. You can see there's

1310
01:26:42,262 --> 01:26:50,615
tears running down her face and she says, "Your
sister left us the day those arrows found my

1311
01:26:50,615 --> 01:27:02,790
"chest. I did not die from those wounds but to
watch you leave me there in the snow. I have a new

1312
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:16,370
"family. I am a Briarwood. And I have a destiny
with the Whispered One." She steps back as the two

1313
01:27:16,434 --> 01:27:22,031
Briarwoods put their arms around your sister, and
even still there's a shake to her voice, and you

1314
01:27:22,095 --> 01:27:31,899
can see in her eyes there's a quake. She speaks
words of conviction, but you know deep inside,

1315
01:27:31,911 --> 01:27:33,995
even there's conflict.

1316
01:27:33,995 --> 01:27:41,405
At which point Delilah kisses her on the head and
says, "Don't worry, my dear. It'll be over soon."

1317
01:27:41,405 --> 01:27:45,780
And they turn around and step into the hallway
they entered from.

1318
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:55,393
LIAM: One question, and I'm assuming I'm gone, but
in combat, I would be able to roll a wisdom save

1319
01:27:55,393 --> 01:27:57,438
every six seconds, right?

1320
01:27:57,438 --> 01:28:02,116
MATT: No. For this, you are technically charmed
for 24 hours.

1321
01:28:02,116 --> 01:28:03,777
LIAM: 24 hours.

1322
01:28:03,777 --> 01:28:06,134
MARISHA: Can I start talking to Vax over the
comms?

1323
01:28:06,134 --> 01:28:07,508
TRAVIS: Can I hit the gem, please?

1324
01:28:07,508 --> 01:28:09,346
MATT: All right.

1325
01:28:09,346 --> 01:28:13,784
LAURA: Can I Hunter's Mark them?

1326
01:28:13,784 --> 01:28:15,733
MATT: You could attempt to.

1327
01:28:15,733 --> 01:28:17,305
LAURA: I'm going to attempt to.

1328
01:28:17,305 --> 01:28:21,142
MATT: Okay. You go to attempt Hunter's Mark and as
the energy springs forth from your hand, it hits

1329
01:28:21,142 --> 01:28:26,251
the green wall and scatters across, the arcane
nature of the spell halted immediately.

1330
01:28:26,251 --> 01:28:27,999
LAURA: Yeah, figured as much.

1331
01:28:27,999 --> 01:28:31,279
MATT: Now, at this point, as you're going for the
nearest gem on the wall?

1332
01:28:31,279 --> 01:28:33,379
TRAVIS: Yeah, the same one I had before that
cracked a little.

1333
01:28:33,379 --> 01:28:35,526
MATT: Okay. So go ahead and take another shot.

1334
01:28:35,526 --> 01:28:37,386
TRAVIS: 21.

1335
01:28:37,386 --> 01:28:40,743
MATT: All right. You strike down and slam it. Go
ahead and roll damage.

1336
01:28:40,743 --> 01:28:42,694
SAM: It's one on the wall, yeah?

1337
01:28:42,694 --> 01:28:46,697
TRAVIS: Yeah, same one I hit before. 15 again, no
fire damage.

1338
01:28:46,697 --> 01:28:52,193
MATT: Okay. You strike the gem. This time the gem
shatters. Pieces of it go flying out of the area

1339
01:28:52,193 --> 01:28:58,685
and parts of it turn to dust and chunks hit and
roll down into the acid. The acid, which now is

1340
01:28:58,685 --> 01:29:01,859
about a foot and half, two feet high, and is
slowly rising in the room.

1341
01:29:01,859 --> 01:29:03,093
LAURA: Oh god!

1342
01:29:03,093 --> 01:29:04,532
SAM: I step into the acid.

1343
01:29:04,532 --> 01:29:05,778
MATT: Okay.

1344
01:29:05,778 --> 01:29:10,244
SAM: And I start hitting the one in the center
with my fucking stupid sword.

1345
01:29:10,244 --> 01:29:16,039
LAURA: I shoot my exploding arrow at the glass.

1346
01:29:16,039 --> 01:29:18,645
MATT: At the glass? Okay.

1347
01:29:18,645 --> 01:29:22,188
SAM: Okay. Big arrow?

1348
01:29:22,188 --> 01:29:24,060
LAURA: It's an exploding arrow.

1349
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:26,640
MATT: You guys watch Vax turn around and begin to
follow the Briarwoods.

1350
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:36,210
MARISHA: I start talking to Vax. Vax. It's Kiki.
Don't forget who you are. You are stronger than

1351
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:45,655
this, you are stronger than them. You are not a
Briarwood, you are Vox Machina, and we can't lose

1352
01:29:45,655 --> 01:29:53,672
you. I can't lose you.

1353
01:29:53,672 --> 01:29:55,860
SAM: What was that?

1354
01:29:55,860 --> 01:30:02,149
MARISHA: You're our only hope. Please. You can
overcome this. Please.

1355
01:30:02,149 --> 01:30:04,966
MATT: Scanlan, make an attack roll.

1356
01:30:04,966 --> 01:30:10,530
SAM: 18 plus something, I don't know how to hit
things.

1357
01:30:10,592 --> 01:30:12,988
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll your damage with the
sword.

1358
01:30:12,988 --> 01:30:18,105
SAM: Is that a d20? No, it says 1d8 plus three.
Okay, that's not much.

1359
01:30:18,105 --> 01:30:20,188
LAURA: It's something, it's something.

1360
01:30:20,188 --> 01:30:22,480
TRAVIS: Can Pike do something?

1361
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:27,338
MATT: If Pike wants to. Yeah, you guys are all
together still.

1362
01:30:27,338 --> 01:30:29,029
TRAVIS: Pike, do some cool shit!

1363
01:30:29,029 --> 01:30:30,005
SAM: 11.

1364
01:30:30,005 --> 01:30:34,819
ASHLEY: I'm halfway here. This stupid astral
projection is driving me nuts!

1365
01:30:34,819 --> 01:30:35,910
MATT: Oh no!

1366
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:37,231
SAM: 11.

1367
01:30:37,231 --> 01:30:43,109
MATT: As you wade into the acid you feel the sting
as it hits your body. You immediately take five

1368
01:30:43,109 --> 01:30:44,548
points of acid damage.

1369
01:30:44,548 --> 01:30:47,021
SAM: I have a potion of acid resistance that I
drank.

1370
01:30:47,021 --> 01:30:54,551
MATT: You did, so you take three. Three points of
acid damage. And you strike down, arcing down as

1371
01:30:54,551 --> 01:30:58,573
it splashes, parts of it go across your face. You
can feel the tingle of it burn the outside of your

1372
01:30:58,573 --> 01:31:01,292
skin, but not enough to really cause any serious
damage.

1373
01:31:01,292 --> 01:31:02,673
SAM: Not the face!

1374
01:31:02,673 --> 01:31:06,677
MATT: But you strike down and you find it hit the
gem and then slide off as it hits, but you feel it

1375
01:31:06,677 --> 01:31:09,919
give a bit on the impact. Anyone else want to do
anything right now?

1376
01:31:09,919 --> 01:31:11,933
LAURA: I was going to shoot the exploding arrow at
the glass door.

1377
01:31:11,933 --> 01:31:13,186
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll the attack.

1378
01:31:13,186 --> 01:31:14,480
LAURA: I did, and it was 22.

1379
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:21,011
MATT: 22, all right. You release the arrow. It
streaks across the room, hits the glass, and it

1380
01:31:21,011 --> 01:31:25,807
explodes with a reverberating crack. You guys all,
in the middle of trying to figure out this

1381
01:31:25,807 --> 01:31:29,671
scenario, didn't cover your ears in time, and it
nearly deafens you from the blast of the impact

1382
01:31:29,671 --> 01:31:34,711
from the reverberation of the room. However, go
ahead and roll damage on that. Roll arrow damage

1383
01:31:34,711 --> 01:31:38,396
and then an additional 4d6 points of damage.

1384
01:31:38,396 --> 01:31:41,380
LAURA: Oh shit, that would've been so good to have
on them. I'm sorry.

1385
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:51,694
SAM: As my bonus action, I turn to Percy and I
say, Percy, we're surrounded by metal and glass

1386
01:31:51,694 --> 01:31:54,946
and stone above us. Is there anything we can do to
that stone?

1387
01:31:54,946 --> 01:32:00,408
TALIESIN: Whitestone's pretty strong.

1388
01:32:00,408 --> 01:32:04,421
SAM: Can't it burn? Can't you do things with
stone, Keyleth?

1389
01:32:04,421 --> 01:32:10,358
TRAVIS: You have lightning. Are we going to kill
ourselves if we do that?

1390
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:15,800
TALIESIN: You could stone, you could get out of
this.

1391
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:17,367
MATT: So what's the damage on that?

1392
01:32:17,367 --> 01:32:18,805
LAURA: I know.

1393
01:32:18,805 --> 01:32:24,557
MARISHA: I couldn't take Move Earth because we
needed Sunbeam. I have Wall of Stone.

1394
01:32:24,557 --> 01:32:26,029
SAM: What does that do?

1395
01:32:26,029 --> 01:32:27,657
TRAVIS: It could buy us more time if we get on
it.

1396
01:32:27,657 --> 01:32:28,865
LAURA: 43.

1397
01:32:28,865 --> 01:32:37,106
MATT: 43? It hits the glass and as the explosion
settles the smoke rises up and you can see a

1398
01:32:37,106 --> 01:32:42,727
portion of the glass wall about ten feet up,
shards have been chiseled out from the explosion.

1399
01:32:42,727 --> 01:32:46,980
It's taken some damage. Not a heavy amount, but
you can see there has been a portion of the wall

1400
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:49,375
that has been scraped away.

1401
01:32:49,375 --> 01:32:50,560
TRAVIS: About ten feet up?

1402
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,629
MATT: About ten feet up.

1403
01:32:51,629 --> 01:32:52,521
LAURA: Grog!

1404
01:32:52,521 --> 01:32:54,598
TRAVIS: Can I run over there? I'd have to run
through the acid?

1405
01:32:54,598 --> 01:33:00,552
MATT: You would have to, yeah, unless you want to
try and jump across. You could try and jump across

1406
01:33:00,552 --> 01:33:01,539
if you want to.

1407
01:33:01,539 --> 01:33:07,566
TRAVIS: Yes, I would like to jump across, run
over, and start swinging on that section.

1408
01:33:07,566 --> 01:33:08,425
MATT: Okay.

1409
01:33:08,425 --> 01:33:09,775
SAM: What side is this? On the ceiling?

1410
01:33:09,775 --> 01:33:11,892
LAURA: This is on the side that they left
through.

1411
01:33:11,892 --> 01:33:12,942
SAM: Okay.

1412
01:33:12,942 --> 01:33:15,365
MATT: Which, the door is now closed, by the way,
and Vax is nowhere in sight.

1413
01:33:15,365 --> 01:33:16,720
LAURA: The door closed again?

1414
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:19,991
TRAVIS: Can I do great weapon master and hit it
three times?

1415
01:33:19,991 --> 01:33:22,792
MATT: Yeah.

1416
01:33:22,792 --> 01:33:23,809
TRAVIS: Yeah?

1417
01:33:23,809 --> 01:33:27,498
MATT: Scanlan? Are you making another strike at
the gem?

1418
01:33:27,498 --> 01:33:28,793
SAM: Absolutely, is it my turn again?

1419
01:33:28,793 --> 01:33:31,912
MATT: This is all fluid. We'll pull it up as you
go, and you're taking your shot.

1420
01:33:31,912 --> 01:33:35,821
TALIESIN: I'm taking three shots at one of the
gems on the wall.

1421
01:33:35,821 --> 01:33:36,906
MATT: Okay, go for it.

1422
01:33:36,906 --> 01:33:37,953
SAM: 17 to hit.

1423
01:33:37,953 --> 01:33:39,232
MATT: Hits, go ahead and roll damage.

1424
01:33:39,232 --> 01:33:40,274
SAM: Ten.

1425
01:33:40,274 --> 01:33:44,937
MATT: Ten. You strike down a second time, the acid
now beginning to rise; the level's almost up to

1426
01:33:44,937 --> 01:33:50,280
your chest, and it's a little harder for you to
swing, but you still manage to strike true. You

1427
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:54,455
take four points of acid damage, but you can feel
the damage itself is mounting. It's growing with

1428
01:33:54,455 --> 01:33:59,575
each progressive amount of you that is currently
submerged. You strike down, thankfully the liquid

1429
01:33:59,575 --> 01:34:02,819
isn't too thick and you still manage to push
through most of your force, your magical blade

1430
01:34:02,819 --> 01:34:07,502
guiding it down to the gem, and you feel it
(crack) beneath you. Crack and shatter.

1431
01:34:07,502 --> 01:34:08,930
SAM: One down.

1432
01:34:08,930 --> 01:34:10,058
MATT: One down.

1433
01:34:10,058 --> 01:34:11,245
TALIESIN: We have two down.

1434
01:34:11,245 --> 01:34:13,027
MATT: Oh, sorry. Two down, between the two of
you.

1435
01:34:13,027 --> 01:34:15,499
MARISHA: Do there appear to be any weak points in
the metal anywhere?

1436
01:34:15,499 --> 01:34:19,853
MATT: Not that you can tell at a quick glance.
Everything's pretty solid, and it's been used

1437
01:34:19,853 --> 01:34:25,631
multiple times, and you see now that this room is
used, and what they used to melt down all the

1438
01:34:25,631 --> 01:34:30,684
whitestone into the residuum component during
the construction of the ziggurat. Some of the

1439
01:34:30,756 --> 01:34:36,640
notes mentioned it, Ripley mentioned a little bit,
but this-- this is bad.

1440
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:38,439
SAM: Acid melts whitestone?

1441
01:34:38,439 --> 01:34:40,201
MATT: It appears to, yeah.

1442
01:34:40,201 --> 01:34:42,728
SAM: The whitestone on the ceiling?

1443
01:34:42,728 --> 01:34:49,492
MARISHA: The acid that's filling in melts that?
Okay, well, that changes things. Does my Control

1444
01:34:49,492 --> 01:34:51,892
Water spell, would that work with the acid?

1445
01:34:51,892 --> 01:34:57,684
MATT: There's such a little water component that
that spell is used to focusing on, it would be a

1446
01:34:57,684 --> 01:35:05,364
little hard for you to do that in enough of amount
to actually do any serious effect, unfortunately.

1447
01:35:05,364 --> 01:35:07,359
LAURA: Does the acid go through glass?

1448
01:35:07,359 --> 01:35:12,546
TALIESIN: No. Glass is specifically how you
contain acid.

1449
01:35:12,546 --> 01:35:21,202
LAURA: Can I take one of my glass vials that I
have and try to get some acid and put it up on the

1450
01:35:21,202 --> 01:35:22,332
ceiling?

1451
01:35:22,332 --> 01:35:25,061
MATT: You can definitely fill it up, but it's a
ways up.

1452
01:35:25,061 --> 01:35:26,404
LAURA: I'm flying.

1453
01:35:26,404 --> 01:35:27,413
MATT: Oh, yeah!

1454
01:35:27,413 --> 01:35:28,472
SAM: You're flying?

1455
01:35:28,472 --> 01:35:30,470
LAURA: I took a flying potion to get out of the
acid.

1456
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:36,514
MATT: So you bolt down, and it's still pouring in.
The ice on the other side, by the way, shatters as

1457
01:35:36,514 --> 01:35:40,377
it now continues to pour in from both sides,
doubling the speed at which it's filling.

1458
01:35:40,377 --> 01:35:42,278
TALIESIN: I'm taking my three shots at the next
gem.

1459
01:35:42,278 --> 01:35:43,446
MATT: Go for it.

1460
01:35:43,446 --> 01:35:45,533
LAURA: Am I high enough that I can see where the
pipes are coming in at?

1461
01:35:45,533 --> 01:35:46,456
MATT: Yeah.

1462
01:35:46,456 --> 01:35:50,179
LAURA: So I could potentially grab hold of one of
the pipes on the ceiling and try to move it?

1463
01:35:50,179 --> 01:35:51,225
MATT: You could, yeah.

1464
01:35:51,225 --> 01:35:54,512
LAURA: I want to try to grab hold of one of those
pipes and aim it toward the ceiling,

1465
01:35:54,512 --> 01:35:55,730
if I can move it.

1466
01:35:55,730 --> 01:35:57,343
MATT: Okay. We'll get to that in just a moment.

1467
01:35:57,343 --> 01:36:00,424
TALIESIN: The first one was 21.

1468
01:36:00,424 --> 01:36:01,464
MATT: Okay.

1469
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:05,840
TALIESIN: And then the second shot-- dear god, it
hits.

1470
01:36:05,922 --> 01:36:07,586
MARISHA: He rolled an 18.

1471
01:36:07,586 --> 01:36:09,361
TALIESIN: 18, 20, 30.

1472
01:36:09,361 --> 01:36:10,503
MATT: All right.

1473
01:36:10,503 --> 01:36:12,529
TALIESIN: Third shot is 26.

1474
01:36:12,529 --> 01:36:15,231
MATT: All right. All three hit. Roll damage for
all of those.

1475
01:36:15,231 --> 01:36:19,830
TALIESIN: That's 14.

1476
01:36:19,830 --> 01:36:21,274
MATT: Okay.

1477
01:36:21,274 --> 01:36:28,950
TALIESIN: 11 for the second shot, and 14 for the
third shot.

1478
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:34,487
MATT: All right. (three gun blasts) You unload
three bullets in a row. You see, before even the

1479
01:36:34,487 --> 01:36:40,985
last one hits, the opal itself (crash) shatters
off from the final blast, leaving the vacuous hole

1480
01:36:40,985 --> 01:36:47,490
where it once was embedded in the wall. Vex, you
move up and you grab onto it. You begin to try and

1481
01:36:47,490 --> 01:36:51,535
shove it, and even with your Fly spell, you don't
have a lot of weight behind it, so you put

1482
01:36:51,535 --> 01:36:58,003
yourself up against the wall, find some leverage
against one of the metal bars that holds the metal

1483
01:36:58,003 --> 01:37:01,656
plates in place, and you lift. I need you to make
a strength check.

1484
01:37:01,656 --> 01:37:04,422
LAURA: I'm the weakest!

1485
01:37:04,422 --> 01:37:05,821
LIAM: Not this time.

1486
01:37:05,821 --> 01:37:09,503
LAURA: Do I get advantage?

1487
01:37:09,503 --> 01:37:11,915
MATT: Not for this, you don't.

1488
01:37:11,915 --> 01:37:13,339
LAURA: Damn it.

1489
01:37:13,339 --> 01:37:15,280
MARISHA: Can I help her out?

1490
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:22,380
LAURA: Get those Boots of Levitation. Get them on!
Fly up, because I just rolled a fucking zero.

1491
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:25,376
Literally a zero.

1492
01:37:25,376 --> 01:37:36,122
MATT: You grab it, and as you're holding onto it,
it's pliable. It's not a very hard metal, but you

1493
01:37:36,122 --> 01:37:39,947
just don't have the strength, physically, in this
one attempt to bend it in any way,

1494
01:37:39,947 --> 01:37:41,085
shape, or form.

1495
01:37:41,085 --> 01:37:43,602
LAURA: Can I use my dagger that I have?

1496
01:37:43,602 --> 01:37:49,846
MARISHA: Hold on. Use your dagger, and seeing what
she's doing, I'm going to cast my Heat Metal spell

1497
01:37:49,846 --> 01:37:52,436
on it, and start heating and melting it.

1498
01:37:52,436 --> 01:37:53,723
LAURA: The pipe?

1499
01:37:53,723 --> 01:37:54,852
MARISHA: Yeah.

1500
01:37:54,852 --> 01:37:59,974
MATT: So you reach over and cast Heat Metal. The
pipe section sticks out about two and a half feet

1501
01:37:59,974 --> 01:38:04,001
from this point, so you can grasp it there. You
look over and see the metal itself beginning to

1502
01:38:04,001 --> 01:38:05,442
heat up, beginning to glow.

1503
01:38:05,442 --> 01:38:07,007
LAURA: Can I try to lift it?

1504
01:38:07,007 --> 01:38:08,343
MATT: You can.

1505
01:38:08,343 --> 01:38:12,059
LAURA: I wrap my hands in cloth, and then I do
it.

1506
01:38:12,059 --> 01:38:15,282
MATT: Okay, so you take your cloak and wrap it up.
Good call. What are you doing?

1507
01:38:15,282 --> 01:38:25,024
SAM: I say to everybody, when Cassandra put her
hand on the hidden gem outside the glass, it

1508
01:38:25,024 --> 01:38:26,580
closed the doors, right?

1509
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:27,551
LAURA: Yeah.

1510
01:38:27,551 --> 01:38:31,663
SAM: If I put my hands on that while you're
putting your hands on the inside gems, it might

1511
01:38:31,663 --> 01:38:33,279
open the doors, right?

1512
01:38:33,279 --> 01:38:34,638
LAURA: Potentially, but we destroyed them.

1513
01:38:34,638 --> 01:38:35,635
MARISHA: We destroyed two.

1514
01:38:35,635 --> 01:38:38,682
SAM: Yeah, but maybe if we do the other ones, it
would still work? Is it worth a shot?

1515
01:38:38,682 --> 01:38:40,040
LAURA: Can you Dimension Door?

1516
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:41,453
SAM: I could.

1517
01:38:41,525 --> 01:38:42,845
TRAVIS: Can you take some people with you?

1518
01:38:42,845 --> 01:38:44,264
SAM: No. I can take Pike.

1519
01:38:44,264 --> 01:38:45,100
LAURA: Take Pike.

1520
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:46,526
MATT: You can take one person.

1521
01:38:46,526 --> 01:38:47,722
SAM: Of my height.

1522
01:38:47,722 --> 01:38:49,289
MATT: Of your size. Medium creatures.

1523
01:38:49,289 --> 01:38:52,562
SAM: Oh, my size, not my height?

1524
01:38:52,562 --> 01:38:55,081
MATT: Well, you are, as a gnome, a small creature,
aren't you?

1525
01:38:55,081 --> 01:38:57,227
LAURA: But he's Percy-sized right now.

1526
01:38:57,227 --> 01:38:58,261
MATT: Pretty sure.

1527
01:38:58,261 --> 01:38:59,706
TALIESIN: Well, it's fake, though.

1528
01:38:59,706 --> 01:39:01,243
LAURA: Oh, right.

1529
01:39:01,243 --> 01:39:05,203
MATT: Let me double-check this real fast. Yeah, a
gnome's considered small, so it would have to be a

1530
01:39:05,203 --> 01:39:06,202
small creature, for you.

1531
01:39:06,202 --> 01:39:07,445
SAM: I can take Pike.

1532
01:39:07,445 --> 01:39:08,603
ASHLEY: All right, let's go.

1533
01:39:08,603 --> 01:39:09,992
LAURA: Do it!

1534
01:39:09,992 --> 01:39:10,935
SAM: Wait, no.

1535
01:39:10,935 --> 01:39:12,078
LAURA: Just try it.

1536
01:39:12,078 --> 01:39:14,453
SAM: There's four of us in here, and four gems
left.

1537
01:39:14,453 --> 01:39:15,771
MARISHA: How many gems are left inside?

1538
01:39:15,771 --> 01:39:20,513
TALIESIN: Four. But it could be that that's the
only gem that's necessary.

1539
01:39:20,513 --> 01:39:26,423
SAM: Or I could go outside the stone door and see
if there's any more buttons out there to press.

1540
01:39:26,423 --> 01:39:29,897
MARISHA: I think going outside is a good idea. Go
outside.

1541
01:39:29,897 --> 01:39:31,663
MATT: Grog, do you want to make your strikes?

1542
01:39:31,663 --> 01:39:33,150
SAM: Pike, shall I take you with me?

1543
01:39:33,150 --> 01:39:34,277
ASHLEY: Yes, let's go!

1544
01:39:34,277 --> 01:39:35,618
LAURA: Go.

1545
01:39:35,618 --> 01:39:40,243
SAM: The best thing I've ever heard. You and me
in a room alone together.

1546
01:39:40,269 --> 01:39:45,194
TRAVIS: 13, 17, and 13.

1547
01:39:45,194 --> 01:39:46,773
MATT: First two hit.

1548
01:39:46,773 --> 01:39:51,232
TRAVIS: No, it was 15, 20, and 23 on the hits.
That was the damage.

1549
01:39:51,232 --> 01:39:55,613
MATT: That was for the damage? Oh, got you. So as
you slam into it and slam into it, with each

1550
01:39:55,613 --> 01:40:02,289
progressive hit, you can see the glass itself is
gliding off the blade. You're doing bits of

1551
01:40:02,289 --> 01:40:06,161
damage, but it's going to take you a while. You
could get through this in about ten minutes, but

1552
01:40:06,161 --> 01:40:11,238
right now the acid has lifted to the point where
the next round, everyone's going to start being

1553
01:40:11,238 --> 01:40:13,270
submerged.

1554
01:40:13,270 --> 01:40:21,581
SAM: I take Pike by the hands and I will Dimension
Door out through the glass to where she put her

1555
01:40:21,581 --> 01:40:23,656
hand on the hidden gem. Is that right?

1556
01:40:23,656 --> 01:40:29,450
MATT: Okay. You step out of the acid. It's
dripping off the lower half of your body. This

1557
01:40:29,450 --> 01:40:31,987
sizzling smoke is pouring off your body.

1558
01:40:31,987 --> 01:40:35,395
SAM: My leather pants are singed!

1559
01:40:35,466 --> 01:40:36,791
(laughter)

1560
01:40:36,791 --> 01:40:44,661
MATT: Don't Lenny Kravitz this. You walk up the
ramp, you grab Pike, and the two of you appear on

1561
01:40:44,661 --> 01:40:50,090
the other side of the glass door, up on the
platform where Cassandra pressed the final gem.

1562
01:40:50,090 --> 01:40:56,341
SAM: Pike, now's a good time to talk about us,
don't you think? No, I'll just put

1563
01:40:56,341 --> 01:40:58,274
my hand on the gem.

1564
01:40:58,274 --> 01:40:59,978
ASHLEY: Scanlan, not now!

1565
01:40:59,978 --> 01:41:01,196
SAM: Okay!

1566
01:41:01,196 --> 01:41:06,716
MATT: You put your hand on the gem, and put your
hand away for a second and see the gem itself is

1567
01:41:06,716 --> 01:41:10,260
glowing, but does not seem to be--

1568
01:41:10,332 --> 01:41:14,836
SAM: Try to put your hands on the other
non-destroyed gems!

1569
01:41:14,918 --> 01:41:17,176
MATT: Make another strength check now, with the
Heat Metal.

1570
01:41:17,176 --> 01:41:18,542
LAURA: Okay.

1571
01:41:18,542 --> 01:41:20,124
TRAVIS: I'm running over to the other gems.

1572
01:41:20,124 --> 01:41:21,611
MARISHA: Come on, Vex.

1573
01:41:21,611 --> 01:41:23,849
LAURA: That's way better! 13?

1574
01:41:23,849 --> 01:41:28,533
MATT: 13? Okay, with the help of the Heat Metal,
which managed to make the metal more pliable, you

1575
01:41:28,533 --> 01:41:33,032
do still take three points of fire damage because
the metal itself is burning, and you're putting

1576
01:41:33,032 --> 01:41:37,610
your weight against it and pushing against the
edge of the wall, but you pull it up, and it

1577
01:41:37,610 --> 01:41:43,263
begins arcing upward, and you push it over in the
direction of the wall where he is.

1578
01:41:43,263 --> 01:41:44,992
LAURA: Yeah, at the ceiling.

1579
01:41:44,992 --> 01:41:50,638
MATT: Yeah. There is force just pushing it
outward. As it arcs over, it starts splattering

1580
01:41:50,638 --> 01:41:56,166
across the whitestone on the ceiling. As it hits,
the whitestone dissolves and you can see it's

1581
01:41:56,166 --> 01:41:59,241
causing these huge pockmarks in the actual stone
above the glass.

1582
01:41:59,241 --> 01:42:00,259
SAM: Do that more.

1583
01:42:00,259 --> 01:42:01,666
LAURA: I keep doing it.

1584
01:42:01,666 --> 01:42:05,933
MARISHA: I'm going to switch my Heat Metal spell
over to the other spigot.

1585
01:42:05,933 --> 01:42:09,224
LAURA: And I fly over to the other side and do the
same thing.

1586
01:42:09,310 --> 01:42:12,981
MATT: Okay. It's not hitting the whole ceiling.
You could probably take another round to keep

1587
01:42:12,981 --> 01:42:16,094
directing it, if you want to. It's up to you. You
could either keep directing this one, because

1588
01:42:16,094 --> 01:42:17,971
right now it's just starting to hit the ceiling.

1589
01:42:17,971 --> 01:42:19,174
LAURA: I'll keep directing it.

1590
01:42:19,174 --> 01:42:21,834
MATT: Okay. Moving it over there. What are you
doing?

1591
01:42:21,834 --> 01:42:23,530
TRAVIS: I'm running over to the gem.

1592
01:42:23,530 --> 01:42:25,093
SAM: Put your hands on the gems!

1593
01:42:25,093 --> 01:42:26,466
TALIESIN: I'm running over to a gem.

1594
01:42:26,466 --> 01:42:28,490
MATT: Okay. You guys make your attacks on separate
gems.

1595
01:42:28,490 --> 01:42:31,000
TRAVIS: No, we're going to put our hands on the
gem, right?

1596
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,010
MATT: You're putting hands on it?

1597
01:42:32,010 --> 01:42:34,112
TALIESIN: I'm going to hands-on and see if
anything happens, and if nothing does, I'm going

1598
01:42:34,112 --> 01:42:35,487
to pull out my sword and start whacking it.

1599
01:42:35,487 --> 01:42:37,163
MATT: Okay. You guys run up and put your hands on
the gems.

1600
01:42:37,163 --> 01:42:38,413
SAM: Can they get two gems each?

1601
01:42:38,413 --> 01:42:40,340
MATT: They've both gotten two gems each, yeah.

1602
01:42:40,340 --> 01:42:41,627
SAM: And my hand is on--

1603
01:42:41,627 --> 01:42:42,874
MATT: On the bottom gem.

1604
01:42:42,874 --> 01:42:44,537
SAM: Come on, work, damn it.

1605
01:42:44,537 --> 01:42:50,299
MATT: You could, yeah. You could probably get one
gem. There's only four gems left.

1606
01:42:50,299 --> 01:42:54,520
SAM: Could Trinket do the other one? Where's
Trinket?

1607
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:57,563
MATT: Trinket is up against the wall on the sides,
very scared right now.

1608
01:42:57,563 --> 01:42:59,054
SAM and TALIESIN: We need a fourth hand!

1609
01:42:59,054 --> 01:43:02,708
MARISHA: Oh, okay! Still keeping my Heat Metal
spell up.

1610
01:43:02,708 --> 01:43:06,865
MATT: You place all of your hands on the gems? No
apparent effect.

1611
01:43:06,865 --> 01:43:07,949
MARISHA: Fuck!

1612
01:43:07,949 --> 01:43:09,399
TALIESIN: I pull out my sword and start whacking
it.

1613
01:43:09,399 --> 01:43:10,542
TRAVIS: Fuck you, gem!

1614
01:43:10,542 --> 01:43:11,702
MATT: Make another strength check.

1615
01:43:11,702 --> 01:43:14,379
LAURA: Shitballs. We're going to die.

1616
01:43:14,379 --> 01:43:19,260
LIAM: Guys, the Briarwoods' personal quarters are
really plush. They're sick.

1617
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:20,711
LAURA: (laughs) I rolled a zero!

1618
01:43:20,711 --> 01:43:22,070
MATT: You rolled zero again?

1619
01:43:22,070 --> 01:43:23,729
(laughter)

1620
01:43:23,729 --> 01:43:27,630
MATT: You can't quite move the metal enough this
time. It's still arcing, and it's spattering

1621
01:43:27,630 --> 01:43:32,532
against the glass. No effect on the glass, but
it's starting to hit elements of the ceiling. You

1622
01:43:32,532 --> 01:43:39,024
can see the stone is being eaten away. At this
point, everyone who's currently on the ground

1623
01:43:39,024 --> 01:43:45,343
suffers three points of acid damage, as it's now
beginning to reach up to your shins.

1624
01:43:45,343 --> 01:43:47,443
You take two.

1625
01:43:47,443 --> 01:43:48,663
SAM: No, I'm out!

1626
01:43:48,663 --> 01:43:52,386
MATT: I forgot, you're outside. You're fine. Pike,
you don't, because you and Scanlan are outside of

1627
01:43:52,386 --> 01:43:53,286
the room.

1628
01:43:53,286 --> 01:43:54,239
TRAVIS: And I'm resistant.

1629
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:55,804
MATT: Yeah, so you take two.

1630
01:43:55,804 --> 01:44:03,705
SAM: Pike, my love. Is there any way you can get
to the other side of this stone wall to see what's

1631
01:44:03,705 --> 01:44:05,034
over there?

1632
01:44:05,034 --> 01:44:07,095
TALIESIN: Break your gem!

1633
01:44:07,095 --> 01:44:08,365
SAM: Break my gem?

1634
01:44:08,365 --> 01:44:10,266
TALIESIN: The outside gem. Break the outside gem!

1635
01:44:10,266 --> 01:44:12,166
MATT: You hear Percy yelling from the other side.

1636
01:44:12,166 --> 01:44:14,168
TALIESIN: (shouting) Break the outside gem!

1637
01:44:14,168 --> 01:44:15,845
SAM: All I hear is, (muffled noises).

1638
01:44:15,845 --> 01:44:18,040
TALIESIN: (muffled) Just fucking break the gem!

1639
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:19,439
LAURA: Break the outside gem!

1640
01:44:19,439 --> 01:44:22,293
SAM: I think Percy wants us to kiss, Pike.

1641
01:44:22,293 --> 01:44:25,873
TALIESIN: (muffled) Kiss?! No, I just want you to
break the goddamn thing!

1642
01:44:25,873 --> 01:44:27,864
SAM: He said the power of love will inspire him?

1643
01:44:27,864 --> 01:44:29,565
TALIESIN: (muffled) Fuck the power of love!

1644
01:44:29,565 --> 01:44:32,820
(laughter)

1645
01:44:32,820 --> 01:44:38,089
ASHLEY: I take my hand and I Guiding Bolt the top
of the gem.

1646
01:44:38,089 --> 01:44:45,181
MATT: Okay. Roll a spell attack-- or for Guiding
Bolt is it a saving throw?

1647
01:44:45,181 --> 01:44:47,246
ASHLEY: One more time? Sorry, I can't hear you
very well.

1648
01:44:47,246 --> 01:44:49,536
MATT: I can't remember if it's a saving throw or
not for Guiding Bolt. Let me check.

1649
01:44:49,536 --> 01:44:51,399
LAURA: Maybe you could hit it with a mace, Pike.

1650
01:44:51,399 --> 01:44:56,505
MATT: Guiding Bolt-- yeah, make a ranged spell
attack. With advantage, because it's right in

1651
01:44:56,505 --> 01:44:57,595
front of your hand.

1652
01:44:57,595 --> 01:44:58,908
ASHLEY: Okay.

1653
01:44:58,908 --> 01:45:03,144
MATT: So roll two d20s, take the higher of the
two, and add your spell attack modifier.

1654
01:45:03,144 --> 01:45:04,773
LIAM: Cold as ice, Mercer.

1655
01:45:04,773 --> 01:45:06,993
TALIESIN: (laughs)

1656
01:45:06,993 --> 01:45:09,787
TRAVIS: We're hitting gems, too.

1657
01:45:09,787 --> 01:45:11,797
ASHLEY: 16.

1658
01:45:11,797 --> 01:45:13,552
SAM: What did you say, Ashley?

1659
01:45:13,552 --> 01:45:14,616
ASHLEY: 16.

1660
01:45:14,616 --> 01:45:16,224
SAM: She said 16.

1661
01:45:16,224 --> 01:45:19,932
MATT: 16. Yeah, that's easy enough. Roll your
damage for your Guiding Bolt. It's 4d6 radiant

1662
01:45:19,932 --> 01:45:21,006
damage.

1663
01:45:21,006 --> 01:45:22,070
LAURA: 4d6.

1664
01:45:22,070 --> 01:45:23,019
ASHLEY: Okay.

1665
01:45:23,019 --> 01:45:24,388
TALIESIN: I'm hitting my gem, too.

1666
01:45:24,388 --> 01:45:26,186
MATT: Okay. Roll damage.

1667
01:45:26,186 --> 01:45:31,902
LAURA: I'm trying really hard to lift this pipe
with my scrawny little arms.

1668
01:45:31,902 --> 01:45:33,513
MATT: Make another strength check.

1669
01:45:33,513 --> 01:45:34,676
TRAVIS: 17.

1670
01:45:34,676 --> 01:45:35,917
LAURA: Oh no.

1671
01:45:35,917 --> 01:45:37,401
MATT: (glass breaking noise) Your gem shatters.

1672
01:45:37,401 --> 01:45:39,577
TALIESIN: I rolled a 30 to hit.

1673
01:45:39,577 --> 01:45:40,727
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

1674
01:45:40,727 --> 01:45:41,752
LAURA: 12 for strength.

1675
01:45:41,752 --> 01:45:47,989
MATT: 12 for strength? You manage to move it to
the side. You take two points of fire damage as

1676
01:45:48,081 --> 01:45:52,093
the heat from the actual metal itself is starting
to push through the leather, and you can feel it

1677
01:45:52,093 --> 01:45:53,568
burning the edge of your skin.

1678
01:45:53,568 --> 01:45:54,520
LAURA: Okay.

1679
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:59,340
MATT: But you do arc it over a little further, and
it's now (splatter noise) pouring onto the ceiling

1680
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:07,941
and splashing over and down over the glass wall.
You can see, the stonework is melting through and

1681
01:46:07,941 --> 01:46:13,488
after a few seconds of this, you begin to see the
top of where the glass wall ends.

1682
01:46:13,488 --> 01:46:15,015
SAM: Get over it!

1683
01:46:15,015 --> 01:46:22,972
MATT: As the wall dissipates and the acid begins
to push through the rest of the whitestone, you

1684
01:46:22,972 --> 01:46:29,523
guys look up and you can see the ceiling above you
begin to turn dark for a second before part begins

1685
01:46:29,523 --> 01:46:32,664
to (dripping noises) drip acid into the small
chamber that the two of you

1686
01:46:32,664 --> 01:46:34,477
currently are standing in.

1687
01:46:34,477 --> 01:46:38,009
ASHLEY: Total of 20.

1688
01:46:38,009 --> 01:46:43,245
MATT: Total of 20 damage? Yeah, the gem on the
ground before you (glass breaking noise) shatters

1689
01:46:43,245 --> 01:46:45,526
with a blast of radiant energy.

1690
01:46:45,526 --> 01:46:47,895
SAM: And does the stone door behind us open?

1691
01:46:47,895 --> 01:46:51,026
MATT: You still have one more gem left. It's the
one you were touching.

1692
01:46:51,026 --> 01:46:52,665
LAURA: Oh! We have another gem. Hit it!

1693
01:46:52,665 --> 01:46:53,915
MARISHA: The one I was touching?

1694
01:46:53,915 --> 01:46:55,685
MATT: What are you doing, Keyleth?

1695
01:46:55,685 --> 01:47:00,577
MARISHA: I'm going to put my hand on it and do--

1696
01:47:00,577 --> 01:47:02,337
SAM: Squeeze Gem.

1697
01:47:02,337 --> 01:47:10,176
MARISHA: I'm going to do another Thunderwave. Bam!
See if I can Thunderwave crack it.

1698
01:47:10,176 --> 01:47:11,721
TALIESIN: These things are really easy to kill.

1699
01:47:11,721 --> 01:47:13,563
LAURA: Yeah, that's a lot of energy.

1700
01:47:13,563 --> 01:47:15,912
MATT: Roll damage on the Thunderwave.

1701
01:47:15,912 --> 01:47:18,080
MARISHA: They get killed by not a lot, or a lot?

1702
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:20,348
TALIESIN: They get killed by hitting them with
your fist.

1703
01:47:20,348 --> 01:47:21,688
TRAVIS: Or your staff.

1704
01:47:21,688 --> 01:47:24,477
MARISHA: 11 points of damage.

1705
01:47:24,477 --> 01:47:27,920
MATT: 11 points of damage? Okay. Thunderwave
(explosion noise) resounds off, and you see the

1706
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:30,979
gem crack in place, but it's still held in its
current position in the wall.

1707
01:47:30,979 --> 01:47:32,163
TRAVIS: Hit it!

1708
01:47:32,163 --> 01:47:33,369
LAURA: Hit it with your staff!

1709
01:47:33,369 --> 01:47:38,399
MATT: At this point in time, as you guys finish
this, the ceiling begins to open into a tunnel

1710
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:41,497
above you, and acid begins to fill the room that
both of you guys are in.

1711
01:47:41,558 --> 01:47:43,018
SAM: Me and Pike?

1712
01:47:43,018 --> 01:47:44,369
MATT: Yeah, both of you guys.

1713
01:47:44,369 --> 01:47:46,493
TALIESIN: Did I finish killing my gem?

1714
01:47:46,493 --> 01:47:47,623
MATT: You did, yes.

1715
01:47:47,623 --> 01:47:54,676
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to take a shot, if I
have anything else to do. Can I take a shot at the

1716
01:47:54,676 --> 01:47:56,105
gem that she just cracked?

1717
01:47:56,105 --> 01:47:57,008
MATT: Yep.

1718
01:47:57,008 --> 01:47:58,801
LAURA: Does it look like a big enough tunnel now
that I can move the pipe?

1719
01:47:58,801 --> 01:48:03,712
MATT: Right now, a person could climb through over
top of the green wall.

1720
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:04,929
SAM: A goliath?

1721
01:48:04,929 --> 01:48:06,102
LAURA: And a bear?

1722
01:48:06,102 --> 01:48:09,244
MATT: At this point, the way you've been leaning
over and it is slopping over, you could probably

1723
01:48:09,244 --> 01:48:12,757
squeeze them through. A bear, you'd have to push
Winnie the Pooh-style, but it's doable.

1724
01:48:12,757 --> 01:48:14,919
TALIESIN: 18?

1725
01:48:14,919 --> 01:48:16,119
MATT: 18 hits, yeah.

1726
01:48:16,119 --> 01:48:18,293
TALIESIN: That's 16 points of damage.

1727
01:48:18,293 --> 01:48:22,497
MATT: (shattering noise) The last gem shatters
from the blast of the gun. Pieces of the opal

1728
01:48:22,497 --> 01:48:32,042
scatter across your face, Keyleth. Not enough to
cut you. At which point, the green stone wall

1729
01:48:32,042 --> 01:48:38,920
behind you, (scraping noise) lifts up, revealing
the room behind you. The one in front of you tries

1730
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:44,230
to lift up, and is caught because currently, part
of the stone that lifts it up has been dissolved.

1731
01:48:44,230 --> 01:48:47,616
SAM: (laughs) We're smart.

1732
01:48:47,616 --> 01:48:56,011
MATT: Pike and Scanlan, you guys currently, in
that room, suffer three points of acid damage as

1733
01:48:56,011 --> 01:48:58,255
your side of the room is now filling up with
acid.

1734
01:48:58,255 --> 01:48:59,569
LAURA: Dimension Door out, again!

1735
01:48:59,569 --> 01:49:02,635
SAM: Three points? Mine's halved, right, so it's
two?

1736
01:49:02,635 --> 01:49:03,791
MATT: Yeah.

1737
01:49:03,791 --> 01:49:10,289
MARISHA: Okay, out of frustration, I see this, can
I do a wall of stone from underneath the glass to

1738
01:49:10,289 --> 01:49:12,258
try and lift it up?

1739
01:49:12,258 --> 01:49:21,553
MATT: Yeah. Okay. Go ahead and roll a d20 and add
your wisdom check.

1740
01:49:21,553 --> 01:49:28,985
MARISHA: Not great. Oh! I get advantage on wisdom,
right?

1741
01:49:28,985 --> 01:49:31,103
MATT: It's not a wisdom save.

1742
01:49:31,103 --> 01:49:35,142
MARISHA: Fucking shit. Balls. Wisdom. Just
wisdom?

1743
01:49:35,142 --> 01:49:36,514
MATT: Just wisdom.

1744
01:49:36,514 --> 01:49:37,696
MARISHA: Eight.

1745
01:49:37,696 --> 01:49:43,441
MATT: Eight? You use your Wall of Stone spell. You
feel there is the stone surface beneath the

1746
01:49:43,441 --> 01:49:48,436
bronze. You can sense, as the stone begins to push
up from the whitestone beneath the bronze plates,

1747
01:49:48,436 --> 01:49:52,852
and it (impact noise) hits, and it's not strong
enough to force its way through. Both the bronze

1748
01:49:52,852 --> 01:49:55,072
plating, and the wall itself.

1749
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:58,305
MARISHA: Bye, 5th-level spell.

1750
01:49:58,305 --> 01:50:01,258
TRAVIS: Can we lower a rope and get over the glass
now that there's a little space?

1751
01:50:01,258 --> 01:50:02,474
LAURA: Yeah.

1752
01:50:02,474 --> 01:50:06,163
MATT: Roll a strength check to try to bend it
away, if you want to.

1753
01:50:06,163 --> 01:50:09,119
MARISHA: I've still got that Heat Metal up.

1754
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:10,250
LAURA: Nine.

1755
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:11,705
MATT: With the Heat Metal?

1756
01:50:11,705 --> 01:50:13,277
MARISHA: It's still up. It's a concentration
spell, yeah.

1757
01:50:13,277 --> 01:50:15,930
MATT: You start moving it away.

1758
01:50:15,930 --> 01:50:18,123
LAURA: I kick it with my foot to move it out of
the way.

1759
01:50:18,123 --> 01:50:22,301
MATT: You're pushing as hard as you can. It's
shifting, but it's going to take you another round

1760
01:50:22,301 --> 01:50:26,761
to move it over. Pike and Scanlan--

1761
01:50:26,761 --> 01:50:30,851
LAURA: I'm like Chun Lee, my legs are so strong.

1762
01:50:30,851 --> 01:50:39,015
MATT: You are, technically. That's only one point
of acid damage to both of you because these d6 are

1763
01:50:39,015 --> 01:50:42,743
rolling crap. But this is the second round because
it's filling up, so it's two of those. And I

1764
01:50:42,743 --> 01:50:46,818
rolled a one! So two points of acid, but you take
one because you're halved. So two points of acid

1765
01:50:46,818 --> 01:50:51,210
damage to you, Pike. You're now up to about waist
high in this acid that's beginning to burn through

1766
01:50:51,210 --> 01:50:52,382
and dissolve.

1767
01:50:52,382 --> 01:51:00,263
Who's doing what now? Anything? Anyone else, or
are you just waiting on these guys to finish with

1768
01:51:00,263 --> 01:51:01,858
their actions?

1769
01:51:01,955 --> 01:51:03,845
SAM: Should I get out of here and try to start
working on the stone?

1770
01:51:03,845 --> 01:51:06,705
LAURA: Go on the other side so you can open up the
door that leads out.

1771
01:51:06,705 --> 01:51:14,491
TALIESIN: Wait, I'm so sorry, how far out is the
acid room from where we are right now?

1772
01:51:14,491 --> 01:51:17,366
MATT: You mean the room they're in?

1773
01:51:17,366 --> 01:51:19,596
TALIESIN: No, the room that the acid is stored
in.

1774
01:51:19,596 --> 01:51:22,622
MATT: You don't know, actually. Oh, you mean the
one that was way back?

1775
01:51:22,622 --> 01:51:23,356
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1776
01:51:23,356 --> 01:51:24,458
MATT: That was quite a ways away.

1777
01:51:24,458 --> 01:51:25,427
TALIESIN: Oh, damn it. Okay.

1778
01:51:25,427 --> 01:51:26,524
MATT: It's probably a mile behind you.

1779
01:51:26,524 --> 01:51:30,734
SAM: Pike, is there any way you can get through
this stone wall to the other side

1780
01:51:30,734 --> 01:51:31,934
to see what's there?

1781
01:51:31,934 --> 01:51:35,298
LAURA: Oh, yeah! You're made of jelly. Can you do
it?

1782
01:51:35,298 --> 01:51:38,948
SAM: Oh no, we can't hear you.

1783
01:51:38,948 --> 01:51:40,879
MATT: Hold on, we can't hear you.

1784
01:51:40,879 --> 01:51:42,849
SAM: The darkness is consuming her.

1785
01:51:42,849 --> 01:51:47,266
LIAM: Oh no, she's muted. Hanging up and calling
you back.

1786
01:51:47,266 --> 01:51:50,446
MATT: Roll a perception check.

1787
01:51:50,446 --> 01:51:52,250
SAM: Who, me?

1788
01:51:52,250 --> 01:51:55,798
MATT: Yes.

1789
01:51:55,798 --> 01:52:00,582
LIAM: I am having some fabulous dark chocolate
right now. It is so good.

1790
01:52:00,582 --> 01:52:01,967
They're feeding it to me.

1791
01:52:01,967 --> 01:52:04,594
MATT: Can we hear you, Ashley? There we go.

1792
01:52:04,594 --> 01:52:05,751
SAM: Four.

1793
01:52:05,751 --> 01:52:06,821
MATT: Okay.

1794
01:52:06,891 --> 01:52:08,065
ASHLEY: Okay.

1795
01:52:08,065 --> 01:52:10,584
MATT: Pike, roll a perception check.

1796
01:52:10,796 --> 01:52:14,877
ASHLEY: Okay. Sorry, guys! I don't know what's
going on.

1797
01:52:14,877 --> 01:52:16,281
SAM: It's the evil.

1798
01:52:16,281 --> 01:52:20,444
ASHLEY: I know, it's the evil! It's so strong! I
rolled a 19.

1799
01:52:20,444 --> 01:52:25,369
MATT: Okay. As the acid's pouring and you're
looking about, you notice that the acid level

1800
01:52:25,369 --> 01:52:31,733
raised to a certain point, and doesn't seem to be
continuing. Actually, glancing over, you see the

1801
01:52:31,733 --> 01:52:37,087
door that the Briarwoods left out of, behind you,
is made of whitestone, and the acid that has

1802
01:52:37,087 --> 01:52:40,732
filled this chamber, which is usually sealed off by
the glass wall that has now spilled over through

1803
01:52:40,732 --> 01:52:48,099
the ceiling, has actually dissolved through the
bottom of the door. At this time, it's begun to

1804
01:52:48,099 --> 01:52:53,220
subside, almost like the liquid that's coming
through is not keeping up with the amount that is

1805
01:52:53,220 --> 01:52:54,969
pouring into the hallway behind you.

1806
01:52:54,969 --> 01:52:56,456
LAURA: That's awesome.

1807
01:52:56,456 --> 01:52:58,148
ASHLEY: Good news, guys! We're not going to
drown.

1808
01:52:58,148 --> 01:53:00,516
MATT: Laura, make another strength check.

1809
01:53:00,516 --> 01:53:06,100
LAURA: Okay. This is the best. Oh, four.

1810
01:53:06,100 --> 01:53:14,237
MATT: Okay. You just can't move it. At this point,
the Heat Metal has burned your arms enough to the

1811
01:53:14,237 --> 01:53:17,303
point where you're finding a hard time managing to
keep your muscles together to move it.

1812
01:53:17,303 --> 01:53:19,205
LAURA: It's made of metal, guys.

1813
01:53:19,205 --> 01:53:26,072
MATT: The doorway that's right there, about
waist-high to you, has completely dissolved on the

1814
01:53:26,072 --> 01:53:27,039
bottom.

1815
01:53:27,039 --> 01:53:28,196
SAM: Oh, so we can swim through?

1816
01:53:28,196 --> 01:53:29,156
MATT: If you want to try, yeah.

1817
01:53:29,156 --> 01:53:31,437
SAM: I'm going to do that. I'm going to take a
snorkel.

1818
01:53:31,437 --> 01:53:37,352
MATT: Okay. In doing so, Scanlan, you take eight
points of acid damage, reduced to four because of

1819
01:53:37,352 --> 01:53:44,609
your resistance. You go through and pop out on the
other side in the hallway. It's a stone hallway,

1820
01:53:44,609 --> 01:53:50,988
and the acid is currently dissolving the ground
below, and it's sinking into the ground, China

1821
01:53:50,988 --> 01:53:52,267
Syndrome-style.

1822
01:53:52,267 --> 01:53:53,749
SAM: Are there any buttons, knobs, levers?

1823
01:53:53,749 --> 01:53:58,944
MATT: Looking up, you do see immediately to your
right in the hallway, there is a stone square with

1824
01:53:58,944 --> 01:54:00,176
a push plate.

1825
01:54:00,176 --> 01:54:01,416
LIAM: Motherfucker.

1826
01:54:01,416 --> 01:54:02,628
LAURA: That's what he pushed. Push it!

1827
01:54:02,628 --> 01:54:05,841
SAM: Did I see Vax push that?

1828
01:54:05,841 --> 01:54:10,242
MATT: You saw Vax appear behind them and push
something in that direction.

1829
01:54:10,242 --> 01:54:11,688
SAM: Okay, so I will push that.

1830
01:54:11,688 --> 01:54:18,725
MATT: Okay, you push it. As it clicks inward, you
hear the grinding of gears and stone, and all of a

1831
01:54:18,725 --> 01:54:23,226
sudden the tube that you're holding shudders for a
second. The fluid begins to stop spewing forth.

1832
01:54:23,226 --> 01:54:28,307
The rest of it begins to glide out, eventually
coming to a stop as the acid stops pouring into

1833
01:54:28,307 --> 01:54:35,485
the room. The door that you swam under lifts up.

1834
01:54:35,485 --> 01:54:49,606
SAM: Guess I could have done that before. Sorry. I
wanted to wait until they were gone. That's what

1835
01:54:49,606 --> 01:54:52,427
it was. I was waiting until they were gone.

1836
01:54:52,427 --> 01:55:00,222
MATT: At this point in time, you see where the
opals were on the sides, the portions that keep

1837
01:55:00,222 --> 01:55:05,447
them housed? Slowly move into the wall, leaving
these holes behind them, and the one in the ground

1838
01:55:05,447 --> 01:55:11,444
depresses and disappears. As it does, the acid
that's in the room begins to slowly drain out.

1839
01:55:11,444 --> 01:55:14,028
TRAVIS: Yes.

1840
01:55:14,028 --> 01:55:16,998
MARISHA: Scanlan, what do you see on the other
side of where you are?

1841
01:55:16,998 --> 01:55:25,215
SAM: I see stone, acid, a very handsome gnome-- oh
wait, that's me. And a big button that I just

1842
01:55:25,215 --> 01:55:26,163
pressed.

1843
01:55:26,163 --> 01:55:27,605
TALIESIN: We can see you now, can't we?

1844
01:55:27,605 --> 01:55:29,396
SAM: Oh, hi. See you guys, you look green.

1845
01:55:29,396 --> 01:55:31,804
LAURA: Unless it's still blocking the way because
the door won't open, so we have to go up and over

1846
01:55:31,804 --> 01:55:33,826
the fucking door. So that's what we have to do.

1847
01:55:33,826 --> 01:55:35,636
TRAVIS: Up and over the wall?

1848
01:55:35,636 --> 01:55:38,975
LAURA: The glass door that is partially destroyed
that won't lower.

1849
01:55:38,975 --> 01:55:40,494
MARISHA: We can't open the door.

1850
01:55:40,494 --> 01:55:43,434
SAM: None, no more buttons or levers out there?
Nothing else?

1851
01:55:43,434 --> 01:55:46,741
MATT: Not currently. You guys smashed everything
that was in the vicinity.

1852
01:55:46,741 --> 01:55:51,390
LAURA: We jammed the door. It won't open. So.
There's a tunnel; we can go up and over.

1853
01:55:51,390 --> 01:55:52,774
SAM: All right, do that.

1854
01:55:52,774 --> 01:55:54,513
TALIESIN: We have a rope.

1855
01:55:54,513 --> 01:55:56,022
MARISHA: Throw a rope over to get over.

1856
01:55:56,022 --> 01:55:59,568
MATT: You wait a few moments for the level to
descend a little bit to the point where you can

1857
01:55:59,568 --> 01:56:03,750
stand comfortably without taking any acid damage.
As it drains over, there is that portion of

1858
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:08,042
ceiling now where it's pockmarked and destroyed,
close to where the glass wall hits the ceiling--

1859
01:56:08,042 --> 01:56:14,083
LAURA: I use the earring and I go, Vax! Vax,
please! That acid is filling the room! We're all

1860
01:56:14,083 --> 01:56:16,635
dying. I don't know what to do.

1861
01:56:16,635 --> 01:56:24,314
MATT: As you're walking alongside the Briarwoods
into a new chamber, you hear the words hit your

1862
01:56:24,314 --> 01:56:31,588
ear and you can feel the back of your throat
choking up as a part of you is urging you to run

1863
01:56:31,588 --> 01:56:37,216
back. And as you stop instinctively in your step,
the rest of the group walks ahead about ten feet

1864
01:56:37,216 --> 01:56:43,956
before Sylas looks over his shoulder and says,
"Keep up, please. There's work to be done." At

1865
01:56:43,956 --> 01:56:47,431
which point, you feel yourself just continue
stepping forward and catching up to him, because

1866
01:56:47,431 --> 01:56:49,841
you wouldn't want to make Sylas angry.

1867
01:56:49,841 --> 01:56:52,044
TRAVIS: Purple Man.

1868
01:56:52,044 --> 01:56:54,826
MARISHA: Yeah, I was just going to say. Fucking
fuck you, David Tennant.

1869
01:56:54,826 --> 01:56:57,150
(laughter)

1870
01:56:57,150 --> 01:56:59,463
TRAVIS: We've got to get out of this room.

1871
01:56:59,463 --> 01:57:01,556
LAURA: Yeah. Up and over, let's go.

1872
01:57:01,556 --> 01:57:04,201
MATT: All right. How are you guys getting over,
through?

1873
01:57:04,201 --> 01:57:05,678
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Rope.

1874
01:57:05,678 --> 01:57:07,742
LAURA: I have the robe of infinite rope-ness.

1875
01:57:07,742 --> 01:57:13,841
MATT: Okay, so you take a few times. You want to
just throw the rope over? You could, however you

1876
01:57:13,841 --> 01:57:16,291
want to get the rope up and over the area, it
takes a few tries but you get it

1877
01:57:16,291 --> 01:57:17,802
on the other side.

1878
01:57:17,802 --> 01:57:19,008
LAURA: I'm flying.

1879
01:57:19,008 --> 01:57:24,083
MATT: Oh yeah, you're flying, you just drop it
over. It's fine. We'll say for the sake of

1880
01:57:24,083 --> 01:57:27,798
brevity, a few minutes pass. You guys manage to
get each one of you over, Trinket being the

1881
01:57:27,798 --> 01:57:29,088
hardest point.

1882
01:57:29,088 --> 01:57:31,672
LAURA: I tie him and then Grog lifts him like a
pulley.

1883
01:57:31,672 --> 01:57:34,611
TALIESIN: Very uncomfortable for everyone
involved.

1884
01:57:34,611 --> 01:57:38,732
MATT: Which, when Trinket reaches the top, it's
like trying to fit an oblong

1885
01:57:38,732 --> 01:57:40,057
object through a hole.

1886
01:57:40,057 --> 01:57:44,935
LAURA: I'm flying so I get underneath him and try
and wedge him, help him get into the hole.

1887
01:57:44,935 --> 01:57:47,926
MATT: We'll say it takes an additional ten
minutes, but you manage

1888
01:57:47,926 --> 01:57:49,353
to finally get Trinket through.

1889
01:57:49,353 --> 01:57:51,765
LIAM: Oh, I have a rumbly in my tumbly.

1890
01:57:51,765 --> 01:57:59,913
MATT: That was straight-up Winnie the Pooh. I'm
really happy about that. On the other side of the

1891
01:57:59,976 --> 01:58:06,687
now pretty much ruined acid distillery, the
residuum factory that was constructed here by the

1892
01:58:06,687 --> 01:58:12,074
Briarwoods, you can see in the tunnel before you
that most of the stone before you has dissolved,

1893
01:58:12,074 --> 01:58:19,142
and there's certain levels of eroded stonework
that descends about 30 feet before rockily

1894
01:58:19,142 --> 01:58:27,066
climbing back up to the original height it was. It
can be traversed, climbed with mild difficulty,

1895
01:58:27,066 --> 01:58:34,579
but you gather yourselves to continue pushing
forward and to both complete this journey and to

1896
01:58:34,579 --> 01:58:39,535
retrieve your ally who is now currently under the
gaze of your enemy.

1897
01:58:39,535 --> 01:58:44,371
And with that, we're going to take a quick
bathroom break. Quick break.

1898
01:58:44,371 --> 01:58:46,037
Want to get back into this.

1899
01:58:46,037 --> 01:58:48,818
TRAVIS: We'll be right back, Ashley.

1900
01:58:48,818 --> 01:58:50,968
MATT: See you guys in a second.

1901
01:58:50,968 --> 02:07:17,957
[break]

1902
02:07:18,021 --> 02:07:23,975
MATT: And welcome back, everyone. So. As you all
take a moment to regather yourselves after this

1903
02:07:23,975 --> 02:07:29,528
circumstance, you climb your way through this
acid-scarred portion of the hallway ahead of you,

1904
02:07:29,528 --> 02:07:34,949
this like small tunnel up to the other side. As
you're on your way there, Percy, you notice a

1905
02:07:34,949 --> 02:07:42,945
flash of purple and black energy course up the
front of your Pepperbox. You glance down at the

1906
02:07:42,945 --> 02:07:47,945
six o'clock, previously empty barrel, and a new
name now is emblazoned across it. It says,

1907
02:07:47,945 --> 02:07:49,363
"Cassandra de Rolo."

1908
02:07:49,363 --> 02:07:50,464
ALL: Oh!

1909
02:07:50,464 --> 02:07:52,507
TRAVIS: Oh. My. God.

1910
02:07:52,507 --> 02:07:59,290
MARISHA: Wait, that was on that empty barrel?

1911
02:07:59,290 --> 02:08:01,939
ASHLEY: What?

1912
02:08:01,939 --> 02:08:05,362
LAURA: Oh my god. I thought--

1913
02:08:05,362 --> 02:08:07,963
MARISHA: He didn't know who it was for.

1914
02:08:07,963 --> 02:08:09,257
LAURA: Oh my god.

1915
02:08:09,257 --> 02:08:13,833
SAM: Wow.

1916
02:08:13,833 --> 02:08:15,770
TRAVIS: Does any of us see this besides him?

1917
02:08:15,770 --> 02:08:19,463
MATT: You guys all come up to the top, you look
down and you see Percy still down, looking at his

1918
02:08:19,463 --> 02:08:24,086
gun in a wide-eyed, spacey expression on his
face.

1919
02:08:24,086 --> 02:08:25,601
LAURA: Percival?

1920
02:08:25,601 --> 02:08:26,728
TRAVIS: You all right?

1921
02:08:26,728 --> 02:08:29,763
TALIESIN: No. No, I'm not.

1922
02:08:29,763 --> 02:08:41,100
SAM: Is your bangy thing okay? Is it your sister?

1923
02:08:41,100 --> 02:08:43,874
TALIESIN: We'll see what this means.

1924
02:08:43,874 --> 02:08:45,981
MARISHA: Oh, Percy.

1925
02:08:45,981 --> 02:08:49,612
TALIESIN: Let's go take care of this.

1926
02:08:49,612 --> 02:08:54,291
TRAVIS: Yeah. Let's. But you always have a
choice.

1927
02:08:54,291 --> 02:08:56,530
TALIESIN: We'll see.

1928
02:08:56,530 --> 02:09:02,514
MATT: You climb up and out, you guys make your way
down this tunnel, no more than 60 feet from where

1929
02:09:02,514 --> 02:09:12,619
you are, before the chamber opens up before you
into what is a large underground cavern. Mostly

1930
02:09:12,619 --> 02:09:15,565
cleared out, it looks like portions of it are, you
know, both the tunnel and this area--

1931
02:09:15,565 --> 02:09:17,032
LAURA: Can we stealth?

1932
02:09:17,032 --> 02:09:18,144
MATT: You can if you'd like.

1933
02:09:18,144 --> 02:09:22,023
LAURA: I think we should, because as far as they
know, we're dead now. They don't know we got out

1934
02:09:22,023 --> 02:09:22,848
of there.

1935
02:09:22,848 --> 02:09:23,941
MARISHA: It's true.

1936
02:09:23,941 --> 02:09:25,668
MATT: Okay. So everyone go ahead and roll
stealth.

1937
02:09:25,668 --> 02:09:29,314
MARISHA: Oh my god.

1938
02:09:29,314 --> 02:09:32,840
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to cast Pass Without a
Trace on us.

1939
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:35,229
MARISHA: I still critical failed.

1940
02:09:35,229 --> 02:09:39,241
LAURA: Wait, can't you roll again now that I told
you we were casting--

1941
02:09:39,241 --> 02:09:42,472
MATT: (laughs) Nah. It stays, unfortunately.

1942
02:09:42,554 --> 02:09:44,018
LAURA: Doesn't work that way?

1943
02:09:44,018 --> 02:09:47,405
MATT: All right, so, stealth rolls, plus ten to
everyone's stealth. What was it?

1944
02:09:47,498 --> 02:09:48,301
TRAVIS: 26.

1945
02:09:48,301 --> 02:09:49,363
MATT: 26. Vex?

1946
02:09:49,363 --> 02:09:51,943
ASHLEY: 16.

1947
02:09:51,943 --> 02:09:55,914
LAURA: Nice. 35.

1948
02:09:55,914 --> 02:09:57,743
SAM: 27.

1949
02:09:57,743 --> 02:09:59,913
TALIESIN: 24.

1950
02:09:59,913 --> 02:10:05,843
MATT: Okay. As a median, the group does really
well, so that helps overtake for your misstep.

1951
02:10:05,928 --> 02:10:09,134
MARISHA: God, it's cold in here! Jesus.

1952
02:10:09,134 --> 02:10:14,829
MATT: Looking around, you can see the boards and
pieces of wood and stone that are keeping this

1953
02:10:14,829 --> 02:10:24,105
hallway up, and as you step into this large
chamber, it's dark and mostly freshly carved

1954
02:10:24,158 --> 02:10:28,152
earth. Elements of earth have been taken out, and
you can see to the right and left of you as you

1955
02:10:28,152 --> 02:10:32,826
enter this chamber there are more and more chunks
of that broken stone and large piles of moved

1956
02:10:32,826 --> 02:10:38,975
earth that are in some levels of being left there
or going to be moved out, or eventually were put

1957
02:10:38,975 --> 02:10:42,361
to a point where it was no longer necessary to
have to clear the area.

1958
02:10:42,361 --> 02:10:52,047
You do see, on the sides of you, there are these
iron carts, wheeled carts that have handles on

1959
02:10:52,047 --> 02:10:59,222
them. Some have means of being pulled along
separately. These carts were used, you can gather,

1960
02:10:59,222 --> 02:11:02,585
for moving a lot of the materials back and forth.
It's probably what the ramps in the previous rooms

1961
02:11:02,585 --> 02:11:10,018
were also to collect. You can see there's a
residuum dust coating on a lot of these carts, as

1962
02:11:10,018 --> 02:11:12,102
well as broken pieces of whitestone.

1963
02:11:12,102 --> 02:11:16,534
TRAVIS: The broken pieces of whitestone, are there
any that are the size of two hands?

1964
02:11:16,534 --> 02:11:19,282
MATT: There's a few you could probably grab,
yeah.

1965
02:11:19,282 --> 02:11:22,368
TRAVIS: Can I grab a big, two-handed piece and put
it in the Bag of Holding?

1966
02:11:22,368 --> 02:11:23,380
MATT: Sure.

1967
02:11:23,380 --> 02:11:26,496
LAURA: Can I take some of it and rub it on some of
my arrows?

1968
02:11:26,496 --> 02:11:37,358
MATT: Okay. Sure. You rub it on. Most of it falls
off, as it's metallic arrow point to dust, but

1969
02:11:37,358 --> 02:11:43,473
some of it does manage to stay on for the time
being. Your holy oil is still active, those that

1970
02:11:43,473 --> 02:11:48,098
you dipped your arrows in. However, as you look
past the darkness, you can see in the center of

1971
02:11:48,098 --> 02:11:59,867
this room a monolithic structure not unlike a
large pyramid-type platformed element, and

1972
02:11:59,867 --> 02:12:05,616
immediately upon looking at it, you can see this
has to be the ziggurat that everyone's been

1973
02:12:05,616 --> 02:12:08,471
talking about in Whitestone.

1974
02:12:08,471 --> 02:12:15,253
You can see that the base of it is white, and is
very much the same texture and color as all of the

1975
02:12:15,253 --> 02:12:19,056
whitestone you've seen used in the construction
and all of the mining materials here within the

1976
02:12:19,056 --> 02:12:24,736
city, but from what little light you have in the
room-- and there is a little bit of ambient light

1977
02:12:24,736 --> 02:12:29,366
from torches set at different points, and those
who can see decently at a distance, and there is

1978
02:12:29,366 --> 02:12:36,729
an ominous glow to the structure itself-- it
gradually turns to a greenish color. Hard to see

1979
02:12:36,729 --> 02:12:41,617
exactly why this transition is, but it goes from
white to a green towards the top, and it levels

1980
02:12:41,617 --> 02:12:47,311
off. You can see what looks to be a small separate
structure at the very top. There are long

1981
02:12:47,311 --> 02:12:52,907
stairways that are visible on the two sides you
can see before you: long stairways.

1982
02:12:52,907 --> 02:12:55,079
Everyone make a perception check.

1983
02:12:55,079 --> 02:12:58,744
LAURA: I'm scared of all of my dice right now.

1984
02:12:58,744 --> 02:13:00,898
MARISHA: Yeah, mine are failing me.

1985
02:13:00,898 --> 02:13:01,954
SAM: One.

1986
02:13:01,954 --> 02:13:02,969
MARISHA: Fucking shit.

1987
02:13:02,969 --> 02:13:05,113
LAURA: 18.

1988
02:13:05,113 --> 02:13:06,358
ASHLEY: 14.

1989
02:13:06,358 --> 02:13:07,387
TRAVIS: Ten.

1990
02:13:07,387 --> 02:13:08,915
TALIESIN: 24.

1991
02:13:08,915 --> 02:13:09,997
MARISHA: 16.

1992
02:13:09,997 --> 02:13:17,532
MATT: Okay. Vex and Percy: as you begin to step
out along the wall, and as you guys are moving

1993
02:13:17,532 --> 02:13:22,584
towards the ziggurat, you can see through the
darkness, there is a bit of low light along the

1994
02:13:22,584 --> 02:13:29,275
edge of the pyramid, and you can see, halfway up
the staircase, four individuals stepping up the

1995
02:13:29,275 --> 02:13:30,801
stairs at a distance.

1996
02:13:30,801 --> 02:13:35,144
SAM: Is this Egyptian pyramid-sized big?

1997
02:13:35,144 --> 02:13:38,522
MATT: It's more Aztec. It's not quite gargantuan.

1998
02:13:38,522 --> 02:13:41,251
SAM: There's 200 stairs?

1999
02:13:41,251 --> 02:13:46,906
MATT: Approximately. I'd say the whole structure
from bottom to high is maybe 200 feet tall. It's

2000
02:13:46,906 --> 02:13:48,577
not extremely large.

2001
02:13:48,577 --> 02:13:50,563
TALIESIN: What's the roof look like above it?

2002
02:13:50,563 --> 02:13:54,883
MATT: It's hard to see at this distance,
especially with the very little light here. You

2003
02:13:54,883 --> 02:13:58,182
can tell just enough, though, that there is some
sort of roof, but you can't make any details out

2004
02:13:58,182 --> 02:13:59,479
from this distance.

2005
02:13:59,479 --> 02:14:03,396
MARISHA: Do I have any geographical idea of where
we are in the city? Is this located

2006
02:14:03,396 --> 02:14:04,799
under the Sun Tree?

2007
02:14:04,799 --> 02:14:07,350
MATT: This would be pretty close to where the Sun
Tree is located, yeah.

2008
02:14:07,350 --> 02:14:13,266
SAM: Before we go stomping in there, should we
take a short rest and heal up? Is anyone besides

2009
02:14:13,266 --> 02:14:15,215
me and Pike damaged at all?

2010
02:14:15,215 --> 02:14:16,823
LAURA: I'm damaged a little.

2011
02:14:16,823 --> 02:14:18,024
MARISHA: I'm damaged, but--

2012
02:14:18,024 --> 02:14:20,666
LAURA: I don't know how long I want to wait when
Vax is--

2013
02:14:20,666 --> 02:14:22,981
SAM: We don't want to start traipsing up. They'll
see us coming.

2014
02:14:22,981 --> 02:14:25,009
TRAVIS: Is there cover? Can they see us if we can
see them?

2015
02:14:25,009 --> 02:14:31,673
MATT: Where you're currently standing, there's
very little to no light. If you're careful, you

2016
02:14:31,673 --> 02:14:34,313
could possibly slip by their detection.

2017
02:14:34,379 --> 02:14:37,574
SAM: Or we could wait until they get up there and
then go.

2018
02:14:37,678 --> 02:14:39,557
TALIESIN: Except what happens when they get up
there?

2019
02:14:39,557 --> 02:14:44,682
LIAM: Quick question: while I'm with my new
friends, in any moments that they're not telling

2020
02:14:44,682 --> 02:14:48,423
me to go somewhere or walk somewhere, can I just
look at the symbol on my hand?

2021
02:14:48,423 --> 02:14:50,021
MATT: Yeah.

2022
02:14:50,021 --> 02:14:54,580
LIAM: That's it. Just stare at it whenever I can,
when they're not paying attention.

2023
02:14:54,580 --> 02:15:01,204
MATT: Okay. You glance at it. It doesn't seem to
have any particular glow or connection. Especially

2024
02:15:01,204 --> 02:15:06,844
since Pike made her arrival, it seems to be the
energy of connection that was briefly housed in

2025
02:15:06,844 --> 02:15:10,626
that symbol by her has transitioned to her form
here.

2026
02:15:10,626 --> 02:15:15,208
TRAVIS: Will anybody gain something back from a
short rest that we really need, or do we need to

2027
02:15:15,208 --> 02:15:16,412
go after them?

2028
02:15:16,412 --> 02:15:19,037
MARISHA: I'm afraid they're marching him to his
death.

2029
02:15:19,037 --> 02:15:20,984
LAURA: To sacrifice him.

2030
02:15:20,984 --> 02:15:22,319
TRAVIS: What about you?

2031
02:15:22,319 --> 02:15:26,603
SAM: I'd gain a few hit points, but it's nothing
bad. I can take a potion.

2032
02:15:26,690 --> 02:15:29,731
MARISHA: We'll have to heal in battle, if we need
to.

2033
02:15:29,731 --> 02:15:33,614
ASHLEY: I can do a healing spell, you know.

2034
02:15:33,614 --> 02:15:36,336
SAM: Thanks, Sarah Palin.

2035
02:15:36,336 --> 02:15:39,866
MATT: If you'd like to.

2036
02:15:39,866 --> 02:15:45,583
ASHLEY: Where's everybody at?

2037
02:15:45,583 --> 02:15:48,211
LAURA: That Vasselheim accent is rubbing off on
you, Pike.

2038
02:15:48,211 --> 02:15:51,577
MATT: Who's looking hurt?

2039
02:15:51,577 --> 02:15:54,478
ASHLEY: Are you guys all pretty low?

2040
02:15:54,545 --> 02:15:55,794
TALIESIN: I'm all right.

2041
02:15:55,794 --> 02:15:57,197
SAM: Not really.

2042
02:15:57,197 --> 02:15:59,164
LAURA: I think save your spells, Pike.

2043
02:15:59,164 --> 02:16:04,120
MARISHA: What's the plan?

2044
02:16:04,120 --> 02:16:05,683
TRAVIS: Let's go.

2045
02:16:05,683 --> 02:16:10,075
LAURA: I don't know. Stealth as much as we can and
then take them out? I don't know.

2046
02:16:10,075 --> 02:16:13,716
TRAVIS: We're at the bottom of this pyramid.
They're walking up to the top.

2047
02:16:13,716 --> 02:16:16,561
MATT: At this time, they're close to the top.

2048
02:16:16,561 --> 02:16:18,219
TALIESIN: Let's start making our way.

2049
02:16:18,219 --> 02:16:21,173
MATT: It's just stairs. Pretty steep stairs, but
stairs nonetheless.

2050
02:16:21,173 --> 02:16:24,635
TALIESIN: We're going to have to Ghostbusters
this.

2051
02:16:24,635 --> 02:16:27,303
LAURA: How high up can I fly? Is it all dark up?

2052
02:16:27,303 --> 02:16:31,913
MATT: It is. There's a very little bit of light
that's part of the ziggurat itself.

2053
02:16:31,913 --> 02:16:33,415
LAURA: I keep raising up.

2054
02:16:33,415 --> 02:16:34,892
TRAVIS: Four sides to the pyramid?

2055
02:16:34,892 --> 02:16:36,456
MATT: Four sides. You can only see two.

2056
02:16:36,456 --> 02:16:39,135
LAURA: I want to keep raising up so I can get a
better view of what's happening.

2057
02:16:39,135 --> 02:16:47,453
MARISHA: I tell Pike real quick, Pike, we are
right under the Sun Tree, which was dedicated to

2058
02:16:47,453 --> 02:16:54,992
the god Pelor. This tree might end up being our
best friend in this fight. Keep that in mind going

2059
02:16:54,992 --> 02:16:55,852
forward.

2060
02:16:55,852 --> 02:16:58,045
LAURA: Are Sarenrae and Pelor good buddies?

2061
02:16:58,045 --> 02:16:59,858
MARISHA: Yeah, are they on good terms?

2062
02:16:59,858 --> 02:17:01,242
ASHLEY: Well, let's hope so.

2063
02:17:01,242 --> 02:17:03,024
(laughter)

2064
02:17:03,024 --> 02:17:04,290
LAURA: Would you know?

2065
02:17:04,290 --> 02:17:11,213
MATT: You would know that Sarenrae and Pelor are
adjacent deities in this realm. They have many

2066
02:17:11,213 --> 02:17:23,055
overlapping interests and both strive to light, to
healing-- many spheres of overlap in those

2067
02:17:23,055 --> 02:17:24,636
regards, so yes.

2068
02:17:24,636 --> 02:17:29,167
ASHLEY: Now that I'm thinking about it, I think
they are pretty good friends.

2069
02:17:29,237 --> 02:17:32,441
SAM: How far away are the four figures from us
right now?

2070
02:17:32,441 --> 02:17:40,007
MATT: Oh, man. They're probably a good 500 to 600
feet from you.

2071
02:17:40,007 --> 02:17:41,512
MARISHA: Should we flank and go?

2072
02:17:41,512 --> 02:17:42,979
SAM: Do you want to just hit them hard?

2073
02:17:42,979 --> 02:17:44,641
LAURA: Or should we get on each side?

2074
02:17:44,641 --> 02:17:46,142
MARISHA: How many feet? 50 to 60 feet?

2075
02:17:46,142 --> 02:17:47,225
SAM: 600.

2076
02:17:47,225 --> 02:17:50,168
MATT: They're at the top of the ziggurat now.
Actually, at this time, they're just now cresting

2077
02:17:50,168 --> 02:17:51,745
over and vanishing over the lip.

2078
02:17:51,745 --> 02:17:55,852
TRAVIS: From the base of the pyramid, what would
you say the base circumference of this ziggurat

2079
02:17:55,852 --> 02:17:58,559
is? Is it half a mile around?

2080
02:17:58,559 --> 02:18:02,152
MATT: No, it's smaller than that. I'd say it's
about--

2081
02:18:02,152 --> 02:18:06,648
LAURA: 200 feet square? One on each side?

2082
02:18:06,648 --> 02:18:08,659
TRAVIS: Yeah, should we come up on different
sides?

2083
02:18:08,659 --> 02:18:10,770
LAURA: Percy, what do you think?

2084
02:18:10,770 --> 02:18:13,407
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Flank them.

2085
02:18:13,407 --> 02:18:16,012
SAM: They're going to be inside, though, before we
get halfway up.

2086
02:18:16,012 --> 02:18:17,565
TALIESIN: There's no inside. It's just on top.

2087
02:18:17,565 --> 02:18:19,255
TRAVIS: We don't know what's up there.

2088
02:18:19,255 --> 02:18:20,904
LAURA: Can I see? I raised up.

2089
02:18:20,904 --> 02:18:22,115
MATT: You raised up and you look--

2090
02:18:22,115 --> 02:18:24,206
SAM: It's for grain storage.

2091
02:18:24,206 --> 02:18:27,564
(laughter)

2092
02:18:27,564 --> 02:18:32,141
MATT: What little source of light you can see,
where the stairs stop, there's a level platform,

2093
02:18:32,141 --> 02:18:37,719
there's some pillars, and there appears to be a
secondary structure, a deep green, almost dark

2094
02:18:37,719 --> 02:18:43,218
jade-type structure that is built. A square
structure right there at the very top.

2095
02:18:43,218 --> 02:18:45,508
MARISHA: Probably out of the same glass bullshit.

2096
02:18:45,508 --> 02:18:48,101
LAURA: Vax will hear me if I whisper down to
everybody.

2097
02:18:48,101 --> 02:18:49,641
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck. That's right.

2098
02:18:49,641 --> 02:18:52,421
MARISHA: See if he can stall. Tell him to stall.

2099
02:18:52,421 --> 02:18:55,490
LAURA: (whispering) Vax. Vax!

2100
02:18:55,490 --> 02:19:03,712
MATT: You can still respond, if you wish. You
still have your mind about you; you just consider

2101
02:19:03,712 --> 02:19:07,182
the Briarwoods right now your closest allies, and
they have to be protected.

2102
02:19:07,182 --> 02:19:09,811
LIAM: Where are you?

2103
02:19:09,811 --> 02:19:14,639
SAM: No. Stop it.

2104
02:19:14,639 --> 02:19:23,807
LAURA: (whispering) I don't know where we are.
Acid everywhere. Vax, please. Isn't there anything

2105
02:19:23,807 --> 02:19:26,284
you can do?

2106
02:19:26,284 --> 02:19:29,267
LIAM: We should all be together. You should join
me here.

2107
02:19:29,267 --> 02:19:32,387
LAURA: (whispering) I would love to, but I don't
know where you are.

2108
02:19:32,387 --> 02:19:43,265
LIAM: I'm on the top of a thing. I can see very
far. Everybody is very attractive up here. I think

2109
02:19:43,265 --> 02:19:48,133
something nice is about to happen. I'm afraid to
ask questions, though; I don't want to seem--

2110
02:19:48,133 --> 02:19:50,605
MATT: "Who are you talking to, lovely boy?"

2111
02:19:50,605 --> 02:19:52,095
LAURA: (whispering) Please, Vax. Please.

2112
02:19:52,095 --> 02:19:54,104
LIAM: To Sarenrae.

2113
02:19:54,104 --> 02:19:59,342
MATT: Make a wisdom check.

2114
02:19:59,342 --> 02:20:06,689
LIAM: With no advantage? I'm still a half-elf.

2115
02:20:06,689 --> 02:20:07,963
MATT: I know.

2116
02:20:07,963 --> 02:20:12,268
LAURA: Isn't he supposed to not be able to get
charmed?

2117
02:20:12,268 --> 02:20:13,759
LIAM: 13. No, I have advantage.

2118
02:20:13,759 --> 02:20:15,044
TALIESIN: Feast.

2119
02:20:15,044 --> 02:20:17,459
MATT: This isn't a saving throw.

2120
02:20:17,459 --> 02:20:19,015
LIAM: Advantage for half-elf, advantage for
feast.

2121
02:20:19,015 --> 02:20:20,465
MATT: What did you roll?

2122
02:20:20,465 --> 02:20:21,403
LIAM: Total of 13.

2123
02:20:21,403 --> 02:20:27,195
MATT: 13? Okay. You continue with the deception.
You pushed through enough to guard the answer, as

2124
02:20:27,195 --> 02:20:34,803
opposed to spilling the truth to your ally. She
gives a, "That's not very welcome here. I would

2125
02:20:34,803 --> 02:20:36,483
"not recommend that. Put it away."

2126
02:20:36,483 --> 02:20:37,568
LIAM: What is that?

2127
02:20:37,568 --> 02:20:39,315
MATT: "Put it away. That's not welcome here."

2128
02:20:39,315 --> 02:20:43,395
LIAM: Yes. You're still very pretty.

2129
02:20:43,395 --> 02:20:47,170
MATT: "I'm taken, my darling."

2130
02:20:47,170 --> 02:20:49,106
LAURA: I'm stalling so that everyone can walk
around.

2131
02:20:49,189 --> 02:20:50,246
LIAM: Me too.

2132
02:20:50,246 --> 02:20:51,941
TALIESIN: I'm starting to make my way up.

2133
02:20:52,009 --> 02:20:54,143
MARISHA: We're flanking on the far side.

2134
02:20:54,143 --> 02:20:56,487
ASHLEY: Can I go up to Vax and--

2135
02:20:56,487 --> 02:20:57,760
LAURA: Oh, he's not here!

2136
02:20:57,760 --> 02:21:02,467
MATT: Vax isn't with you guys. Vax is with the
Briarwoods at the top of the ziggurat.

2137
02:21:02,467 --> 02:21:03,652
LIAM: Earring talk.

2138
02:21:03,652 --> 02:21:08,622
ASHLEY: Shit. Okay, sorry. That must have been
when I got disconnected. I know

2139
02:21:08,622 --> 02:21:09,893
what's going on now.

2140
02:21:09,893 --> 02:21:13,201
MATT: So while they're having this discussion, you
guys begin to ascend the steps as a group?

2141
02:21:13,201 --> 02:21:16,827
TRAVIS: There are four sides. Who wants to come on
my side?

2142
02:21:16,827 --> 02:21:18,125
SAM: Me and Pike.

2143
02:21:18,125 --> 02:21:19,265
TRAVIS: Okay.

2144
02:21:19,265 --> 02:21:20,446
MARISHA: I'll go with Grog.

2145
02:21:20,446 --> 02:21:21,555
LAURA: Wait.

2146
02:21:21,555 --> 02:21:23,167
TALIESIN: And you can join me.

2147
02:21:23,167 --> 02:21:24,260
LAURA: I'm flying up.

2148
02:21:24,260 --> 02:21:26,272
TALIESIN: So I'm just walking up the center.

2149
02:21:26,272 --> 02:21:27,452
LAURA: Trinket's going--

2150
02:21:27,452 --> 02:21:28,438
TALIESIN: With me.

2151
02:21:28,438 --> 02:21:29,240
LAURA: Sure.

2152
02:21:29,240 --> 02:21:30,225
TALIESIN: Trinket's with me.

2153
02:21:30,225 --> 02:21:35,169
MARISHA: Guys, thought for a second: what if Percy
goes as a distraction? Percy goes first.

2154
02:21:35,169 --> 02:21:36,527
SAM: We all look like Percy.

2155
02:21:36,527 --> 02:21:42,295
MARISHA: But they might be able to see through
that. Use Percy as bait while

2156
02:21:42,295 --> 02:21:43,539
the rest of us go up.

2157
02:21:43,539 --> 02:21:46,426
LAURA: Vax looks like Percy right now! They know
we're up to something.

2158
02:21:46,426 --> 02:21:48,571
MARISHA: That's why I said send in the real
Percy.

2159
02:21:48,571 --> 02:21:49,690
LAURA: Send in the real Percy?

2160
02:21:49,690 --> 02:21:52,829
MATT: So, how many groups are you breaking into?

2161
02:21:52,829 --> 02:21:54,308
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Three.

2162
02:21:54,308 --> 02:21:59,343
MATT: Three groups. Okay. Gnomes in one, Percy and
Trinket in one, Grog and who else?

2163
02:21:59,343 --> 02:22:00,431
TRAVIS: Keyleth.

2164
02:22:00,431 --> 02:22:02,410
MATT: Keyleth, and you're floating above
somewhere.

2165
02:22:02,410 --> 02:22:04,138
LAURA: I'm floating above, keeping an eye.

2166
02:22:04,138 --> 02:22:05,137
MATT: Okay.

2167
02:22:05,137 --> 02:22:07,142
LAURA: (laughing) Oh no, this is so stupid.

2168
02:22:07,142 --> 02:22:08,542
MARISHA: My heart is pounding.

2169
02:22:08,542 --> 02:22:15,198
MATT: As you all separate, the closest stairway to
you, you would probably get there sooner. Who's

2170
02:22:15,198 --> 02:22:16,259
taking that stairway?

2171
02:22:16,259 --> 02:22:19,017
SAM: The gnomes. We're slow.

2172
02:22:19,017 --> 02:22:24,472
LAURA: And I'm sneaking into the dark as much as I
can, but I want to raise up and be where I can be

2173
02:22:24,472 --> 02:22:26,054
above them and shoot down.

2174
02:22:26,054 --> 02:22:27,758
MATT: All right, and you three are going on this
side?

2175
02:22:27,758 --> 02:22:28,722
TRAVIS: Sure.

2176
02:22:28,722 --> 02:22:30,480
MATT: Okay, we'll say you're on this side.

2177
02:22:30,480 --> 02:22:35,418
SAM: Maybe we should split the party further.

2178
02:22:35,418 --> 02:22:37,681
MATT: You could. It's not a bad idea.

2179
02:22:37,681 --> 02:22:40,399
LAURA: This is so brilliant.

2180
02:22:40,399 --> 02:22:41,816
MARISHA: We've got this.

2181
02:22:41,816 --> 02:22:45,916
MATT: All right.

2182
02:22:45,916 --> 02:22:47,370
LAURA: Oh god.

2183
02:22:47,370 --> 02:22:53,479
MATT: As you begin to ascend the steps, a couple
of things. One, you notice the structure is very

2184
02:22:53,479 --> 02:23:02,415
old at its base. The whitestone itself is cracked
and worn, weathered, and most of it is indeed made

2185
02:23:02,415 --> 02:23:07,226
from the whitestone from the surrounding mountains
of the Alabaster Sierras, mined ages and ages ago.

2186
02:23:07,226 --> 02:23:12,769
As you get further up, you begin to see sections
of it that are newer stone, areas that have been

2187
02:23:12,769 --> 02:23:20,677
renovated and rebuilt and made to complete this
apparently once-sundered structure.

2188
02:23:20,677 --> 02:23:28,426
As you all begin to creep up past the midpoint,
you begin to notice the color change. The

2189
02:23:28,426 --> 02:23:36,509
whitestone begins to fade away as you begin to see
clusters of that same green residuum glass is now

2190
02:23:36,509 --> 02:23:42,940
set across, smooth, almost like the limestone of a
pyramid, like a top layer to it. As you begin to

2191
02:23:42,940 --> 02:23:47,683
get further to the top, eventually the entirety of
the stone and the stairs are coated in this

2192
02:23:47,683 --> 02:23:53,192
material to the point where there's even a little
bit of slickness in certain places from the

2193
02:23:53,192 --> 02:23:59,063
smoothness. It's like chipped obsidian, how it's
flaked away and has those divots in it. There is

2194
02:23:59,063 --> 02:24:01,504
that smoothness, that glass-like texture to it.

2195
02:24:01,504 --> 02:24:08,868
As you begin to get towards the very top of the
stairway, each of you carefully keeping in line,

2196
02:24:08,868 --> 02:24:14,207
talking to each other quietly, you begin to see
the central structure at the top of the platform

2197
02:24:14,207 --> 02:24:22,617
begin to appear. It is a simple, four-walled
structure made purely of this dark jade glass

2198
02:24:22,617 --> 02:24:30,812
material. There's a slight overhang with a few
platforms that seem to hold this, for lack of a

2199
02:24:30,812 --> 02:24:36,485
better term, awning-type platform that hangs over
the entrance to this.

2200
02:24:36,485 --> 02:24:41,914
You guys are about to reach the lip. Is there any
preparation you want to do?

2201
02:24:41,914 --> 02:24:43,997
TRAVIS: (quietly) I would like to rage.

2202
02:24:43,997 --> 02:24:46,638
(laughter)

2203
02:24:46,722 --> 02:24:51,676
MARISHA: Does the building seem-- is it completely
encased?

2204
02:24:51,676 --> 02:24:55,297
MATT: The building is entirely encased in this
material.

2205
02:24:55,297 --> 02:24:57,078
MARISHA: And they're already inside?

2206
02:24:57,078 --> 02:24:59,552
MATT: You haven't gotten to the very top of the
lip yet.

2207
02:24:59,552 --> 02:25:02,029
LAURA: Can I see? I'm raised above, right?

2208
02:25:02,029 --> 02:25:09,939
MATT: You see, as they're having this
conversation, they talk a bit with Vax, speak with

2209
02:25:09,939 --> 02:25:20,075
Cassandra, then they step forward and begin to
open the two doors to the central chamber.

2210
02:25:20,075 --> 02:25:27,902
LIAM: Can I ask a clarification question? The mojo
they have on me: do I think they're my best

2211
02:25:27,986 --> 02:25:33,265
friends in the world, or is it more Kilgrave; I do
whatever they say, but have my own opinion trapped

2212
02:25:33,265 --> 02:25:34,258
away?

2213
02:25:34,258 --> 02:25:37,713
MATT: You have your own opinion, you just trust
them implicitly. They have to be protected.

2214
02:25:37,713 --> 02:25:41,404
LIAM: All right. It's a little of both, it seems
like.

2215
02:25:41,404 --> 02:25:46,914
MATT: Like any close friend who would ask
something of you and say, "please come with me,"

2216
02:25:46,914 --> 02:25:49,198
there is an essence that you're compelled--

2217
02:25:49,198 --> 02:25:50,452
LIAM: I trust them.

2218
02:25:50,452 --> 02:25:51,981
MATT: You trust them, yeah.

2219
02:25:51,981 --> 02:25:55,665
ASHLEY: Am I close to Percy at all? Or did we
already separate?

2220
02:25:55,665 --> 02:25:57,170
MATT: No, you guys have already separated.

2221
02:25:57,170 --> 02:25:58,315
ASHLEY: Dang it.

2222
02:25:58,315 --> 02:26:03,668
MARISHA: We have to stop them before they close
these doors. If they close the doors, it's over.

2223
02:26:03,668 --> 02:26:05,157
SAM: Do we see them closing the doors?

2224
02:26:05,157 --> 02:26:07,957
MATT: They've just opened the doors and are
beginning to enter.

2225
02:26:07,957 --> 02:26:10,099
MARISHA: Percy, go. Get their attention. Percy!

2226
02:26:10,099 --> 02:26:12,756
TALIESIN: I'm heading up.

2227
02:26:12,756 --> 02:26:19,163
LAURA: I'm going to stay hidden as my-- oh, god--
and I'm going to dip the rest of

2228
02:26:19,163 --> 02:26:20,252
my arrows in holy oil.

2229
02:26:20,252 --> 02:26:21,594
MATT: Okay, as you're stepping up.

2230
02:26:21,594 --> 02:26:23,865
SAM: I inspire Pike real quick, just before the
battle.

2231
02:26:23,865 --> 02:26:26,264
MATT: Okay, what do you do to inspire her?

2232
02:26:26,264 --> 02:26:34,195
SAM: I just look at her and I say, roses are red,
violets are blue, we're both gnomes, and you are

2233
02:26:34,195 --> 02:26:35,976
so foxy!

2234
02:26:35,976 --> 02:26:37,837
(laughter)

2235
02:26:37,837 --> 02:26:40,109
SAM: That's it.

2236
02:26:40,109 --> 02:26:41,391
MATT: All right.

2237
02:26:41,391 --> 02:26:44,833
MARISHA: When I look up, can I see the ceiling
now?

2238
02:26:44,833 --> 02:26:53,429
MATT: Looking up, you can see the roof is carved
earth. There is no loose stone; it looks like this

2239
02:26:53,429 --> 02:26:56,609
chamber has been carefully hollowed out over
time.

2240
02:26:56,609 --> 02:27:01,581
MARISHA: Can I see a root system of a really
deep-running tree?

2241
02:27:01,581 --> 02:27:03,541
MATT: Currently? No, you cannot.

2242
02:27:03,541 --> 02:27:04,894
MARISHA: Fuck. Okay.

2243
02:27:04,894 --> 02:27:07,168
MATT: Percy, what are you doing?

2244
02:27:07,168 --> 02:27:10,649
TALIESIN: I'm walking up the steps. I'm putting
the mask on.

2245
02:27:10,649 --> 02:27:17,161
MATT: As you put the mask on and you begin to
ascend, you can feel the nerves tickle your belly

2246
02:27:17,161 --> 02:27:23,383
and you know what you're about to encounter, and
doing so, you feel that heat rise in the back of

2247
02:27:23,383 --> 02:27:29,640
your neck, and as you do, (whoosh) the smoke
begins to billow out from under your collar and

2248
02:27:29,640 --> 02:27:31,204
out of your sleeves.

2249
02:27:31,204 --> 02:27:34,584
TALIESIN: I make my way to the top of the stairs.

2250
02:27:34,584 --> 02:27:40,711
MATT: Trinket coming slowly behind you. They open
the doors and they're beginning to step into the

2251
02:27:40,711 --> 02:27:41,840
chamber.

2252
02:27:41,840 --> 02:27:43,536
TALIESIN: Sylas!

2253
02:27:43,536 --> 02:27:47,265
MATT: They stop. Both Lord and Lady Briarwood look
over their shoulder.

2254
02:27:47,265 --> 02:27:49,633
TALIESIN: A moment of your time.

2255
02:27:49,633 --> 02:27:59,111
MATT: They look at each other, (sighs) close the
chamber door. Sylas reaches out and grabs

2256
02:27:59,111 --> 02:28:06,524
something or pushes something that's out of sight,
and then they both turn and begin to step forward

2257
02:28:06,524 --> 02:28:12,609
a little bit, with Vax and Cassandra flanking
them, stopping right outside of the doors.

2258
02:28:12,609 --> 02:28:21,979
MARISHA: Okay, as he's distracting them, get in
position? Try and stealth behind these

2259
02:28:22,056 --> 02:28:23,181
buildings?

2260
02:28:23,181 --> 02:28:27,158
MATT: So you guys are on technically that side and
that side of the pyramid right now.

2261
02:28:27,158 --> 02:28:32,912
MARISHA: Yeah. It looks like there's pillars and
shit?

2262
02:28:32,912 --> 02:28:37,544
MATT: Yeah, the pillars are evenly spread around
the entire chamber.

2263
02:28:37,544 --> 02:28:39,918
MARISHA: Yeah, let's come in from the back. I
don't know what the gnomes are doing.

2264
02:28:39,918 --> 02:28:45,018
MATT: You guys would have to have come around the
corner, and this is the walkway here, so you'd be

2265
02:28:45,018 --> 02:28:46,387
coming in from this side.

2266
02:28:46,387 --> 02:28:49,920
SAM: Stay out of sight, but get as close as we
can.

2267
02:28:49,987 --> 02:28:51,969
LAURA: I float closer in the darkness.

2268
02:28:51,969 --> 02:28:54,022
MATT: Okay, over here?

2269
02:28:54,022 --> 02:28:55,222
LAURA: Up. Up.

2270
02:28:55,222 --> 02:28:59,813
MATT: Up, up? My platforms seem to have gone
missing for the preparation of this game, but

2271
02:28:59,813 --> 02:29:03,857
we'll say for the time being, you are up here.

2272
02:29:03,857 --> 02:29:17,049
TALIESIN: My hands are on a device which I have
made that's on my hip that I'm ready to begin

2273
02:29:17,049 --> 02:29:18,911
using at a moment's notice.

2274
02:29:18,911 --> 02:29:20,574
SAM: It's a French tickler.

2275
02:29:20,574 --> 02:29:25,348
TALIESIN: It's the most ticklish French tickler
you've ever seen, baby.

2276
02:29:25,348 --> 02:29:29,521
LAURA: I don't have something planned. I'm just
going to go.

2277
02:29:29,521 --> 02:29:34,707
SAM: What's this? What's going on?

2278
02:29:34,707 --> 02:29:38,430
TALIESIN: We have debts to settle, Sylas.

2279
02:29:38,430 --> 02:29:51,908
MATT: "And apparently, you and your friends are
obnoxious enough to not stay dead."

2280
02:29:51,908 --> 02:29:56,896
TALIESIN: They were kind enough to make sure that
I made my way here to face you.

2281
02:29:56,896 --> 02:30:06,713
MATT: (chuckles) "Well, perhaps this evening won't
be so boring after all, will it?" And Sylas looks

2282
02:30:06,713 --> 02:30:08,594
over to Delilah.

2283
02:30:08,594 --> 02:30:11,675
Delilah gives him a look, too, and says, "Very
well."

2284
02:30:11,743 --> 02:30:26,692
TALIESIN: The darkness demands your soul, Sylas.
I'm going to cast Hex on Lady Briarwood and pull

2285
02:30:26,692 --> 02:30:31,192
my smoke bomb at the exact same second and throw
it at them.

2286
02:30:31,192 --> 02:30:40,200
MATT: Okay. So, as you release your hand and the
smoke builds up at your fingertips and then shoots

2287
02:30:40,200 --> 02:30:47,695
off and clings itself to her form, she looks down
with a bit of a grin, half-laughs to herself as

2288
02:30:47,695 --> 02:30:53,078
the smoke bomb gets lobbed. She begins moving her
hands like that to begin casting a spell.

2289
02:30:53,078 --> 02:30:57,838
LAURA: I let go of my arrow and cast Conjure
Barrage with a holy arrow at them.

2290
02:30:57,838 --> 02:30:59,968
MATT: With a holy arrow at them. All righty.

2291
02:30:59,968 --> 02:31:06,610
MARISHA: And I'm going to, if I can peek around
the corner, start lighting up Sunbeam. They're in

2292
02:31:06,610 --> 02:31:09,735
a nice, pretty line, and I like it. It's hot.

2293
02:31:09,735 --> 02:31:12,419
(laughter)

2294
02:31:12,419 --> 02:31:15,731
MATT: It will take you a moment to get over to
that point because you guys are just coming around

2295
02:31:15,731 --> 02:31:28,155
the corner. So, first things first. Percy, you lob
the smoke bomb. (thud, hiss) This area here fills

2296
02:31:28,155 --> 02:31:29,714
with a billowing smoke.

2297
02:31:29,714 --> 02:31:32,009
TALIESIN: I was shooting it right in front of
them.

2298
02:31:32,009 --> 02:31:37,952
MATT: Yeah, it fills this area here. It's a 20 by
20-foot-- it's essentially a recreation of the Fog

2299
02:31:37,952 --> 02:31:44,868
spell for a short duration. It fills that vicinity
there. As the smoke fills, you want to Conjure

2300
02:31:44,868 --> 02:31:46,464
Barrage into the smoke?

2301
02:31:46,464 --> 02:31:49,752
LAURA: Yeah, I know they're all there, and it
shoots a cone of arrows at them.

2302
02:31:49,752 --> 02:31:51,815
MATT: Yeah. All right, roll for that.

2303
02:31:51,815 --> 02:31:56,822
LAURA: It's holy arrows. All of them will be holy
arrows, because Conjure Barrage uses whatever kind

2304
02:31:56,822 --> 02:31:58,389
of ammunition I have shot.

2305
02:31:58,389 --> 02:31:59,501
MATT: That it does.

2306
02:31:59,501 --> 02:32:01,574
(cheering)

2307
02:32:01,574 --> 02:32:04,985
MATT: So what's the saving throw on that?

2308
02:32:04,985 --> 02:32:11,092
LAURA: Oh, that's a good question. Conjure Barrage
is-- dexterity save.

2309
02:32:11,092 --> 02:32:21,748
MATT: We're going to grave. There we go. Proper
Briarwood music.

2310
02:32:21,748 --> 02:32:23,314
LIAM: Surprise, motherfucker!

2311
02:32:23,314 --> 02:32:25,572
MATT: All right, so.

2312
02:32:25,572 --> 02:32:36,409
LIAM: I don't know why my sister is firing at me,
but I would like to use Uncanny Dodge or Evasion,

2313
02:32:36,472 --> 02:32:39,790
whichever is applicable in this moment, so I don't
get hurt.

2314
02:32:39,790 --> 02:32:42,383
LAURA: There's a whole lot of arrows flying at
you, just letting you know.

2315
02:32:42,383 --> 02:32:46,294
MATT: I believe Uncanny Dodge, you just roll a saving
throw, and if you make it, you take no damage.

2316
02:32:46,354 --> 02:32:47,640
LIAM: So dexterity, right?

2317
02:32:47,640 --> 02:32:48,846
MATT: I believe so, yeah.

2318
02:32:48,846 --> 02:32:50,936
LIAM: That's pretty good. That's a 28.

2319
02:32:50,936 --> 02:32:53,398
MATT: Okay. Damage on that was?

2320
02:32:53,398 --> 02:32:57,862
LAURA: 3d8, plus whatever the holy would be?

2321
02:32:57,862 --> 02:33:00,659
MATT: The holy is an additional 1d4 radiant
damage.

2322
02:33:00,659 --> 02:33:02,205
LAURA: Okay, for each?

2323
02:33:02,205 --> 02:33:04,318
MATT: For anybody that would be affected by it.

2324
02:33:04,318 --> 02:33:12,638
LAURA: Okay. Oh, that's it? I just do that? 3d8,
that's it?

2325
02:33:12,638 --> 02:33:13,583
MATT: Yep.

2326
02:33:13,583 --> 02:33:14,870
LAURA: Nine.

2327
02:33:14,870 --> 02:33:17,156
MATT: Nine. Not including the d4, right?

2328
02:33:17,156 --> 02:33:18,305
LAURA: Not including the d4.

2329
02:33:18,305 --> 02:33:26,534
MATT: So that's four damage to both Sylas and
Cassandra. You take no damage from it because of

2330
02:33:26,534 --> 02:33:27,632
Uncanny Dodge.

2331
02:33:27,632 --> 02:33:29,892
LIAM: I call out and say, Vex'ahlia, what are you
doing?

2332
02:33:29,892 --> 02:33:36,708
MATT: All right, so roll a d4.

2333
02:33:36,708 --> 02:33:38,586
LAURA: Two.

2334
02:33:38,586 --> 02:33:45,650
MATT: Two. Okay. Two additional points of damage
to Sylas. All right, and as the smoke begins to

2335
02:33:45,650 --> 02:33:46,502
dissipate?

2336
02:33:46,502 --> 02:33:52,395
TALIESIN: I'm going to start running. I'm booking
to the right, and I don't have any more actions,

2337
02:33:52,395 --> 02:33:53,398
do I?

2338
02:33:53,398 --> 02:34:01,064
MATT: No, that's going to be your go. Everyone
now? Roll initiative for the beginning of the

2339
02:34:01,064 --> 02:34:02,421
Briarwood battle.

2340
02:34:02,421 --> 02:34:04,685
TALIESIN: Ugh, oh my god.

2341
02:34:04,685 --> 02:34:07,853
MARISHA: I have the shittiest fucking initiative
rolls.

2342
02:34:07,853 --> 02:34:11,208
TALIESIN: That's stupid.

2343
02:34:11,208 --> 02:34:13,449
MARISHA: Yeah, so is mine.

2344
02:34:13,449 --> 02:34:17,578
TALIESIN: Getting it all out of my system now.

2345
02:34:17,681 --> 02:34:20,264
LIAM: Me too. I call it dying.

2346
02:34:20,264 --> 02:34:23,161
TALIESIN: (laughs) That's how you get it all 
out of your system.

2347
02:34:23,161 --> 02:34:26,119
MATT: All right. 25 to 20?

2348
02:34:26,119 --> 02:34:28,544
SAM: Nobody.

2349
02:34:28,544 --> 02:34:29,601
MATT: All right.

2350
02:34:29,601 --> 02:34:31,032
MARISHA: Nobody. We all ate it.

2351
02:34:31,032 --> 02:34:32,731
MATT: 20 to 15?

2352
02:34:32,731 --> 02:34:34,309
SAM: 17.

2353
02:34:34,309 --> 02:34:35,615
TRAVIS: 15.

2354
02:34:35,615 --> 02:34:37,701
SAM: I have the highest initiative?!

2355
02:34:37,701 --> 02:34:39,169
LIAM: 16.

2356
02:34:39,169 --> 02:34:40,533
MATT: 16?

2357
02:34:40,533 --> 02:34:42,643
LAURA: This is a problem.

2358
02:34:42,643 --> 02:34:43,929
MATT: All righty.

2359
02:34:43,929 --> 02:34:52,699
MARISHA: Fuck. We don't get the drop on them
because we were sneaking around?

2360
02:34:52,699 --> 02:34:56,459
MATT: Nope. 15 to ten?

2361
02:34:56,522 --> 02:34:57,872
LAURA: 11.

2362
02:34:57,872 --> 02:34:59,418
ASHLEY: 13.

2363
02:34:59,418 --> 02:35:00,621
TALIESIN: Ten.

2364
02:35:00,621 --> 02:35:01,676
MATT: All right.

2365
02:35:01,676 --> 02:35:03,872
TALIESIN: Worst initiative I've ever rolled.

2366
02:35:03,872 --> 02:35:05,145
LAURA: 11.

2367
02:35:05,145 --> 02:35:08,139
MATT: 11, and Pike, what did you get? Sorry,
Taliesin.

2368
02:35:08,139 --> 02:35:09,399
TALIESIN: Ten.

2369
02:35:09,399 --> 02:35:15,102
MATT: All right, so Vex and Taliesin.

2370
02:35:15,102 --> 02:35:16,301
LAURA: We're going to die.

2371
02:35:16,301 --> 02:35:18,589
TALIESIN: (laughing nervously) We're going to be
fine.

2372
02:35:18,589 --> 02:35:21,290
LAURA: All my dice. Every dice! I don't have any
dice left to roll.

2373
02:35:21,290 --> 02:35:29,401
MATT: At this point in time, Delilah steps this
way, outside of the smoke, (coughs) moving out of

2374
02:35:29,401 --> 02:35:36,101
the way. You can see, there is a slight shimmer
around her form at the moment.

2375
02:35:36,101 --> 02:35:37,788
MARISHA: A slight shimmer?

2376
02:35:37,788 --> 02:35:47,607
MATT: Yes. She is going to begin by looking over
to you, who threw that bomb at her, put out her

2377
02:35:47,607 --> 02:35:49,002
hand, and say--

2378
02:35:49,002 --> 02:35:50,197
TALIESIN: Can she see me?

2379
02:35:50,197 --> 02:35:51,603
MATT: She stepped out of the smoke.

2380
02:35:51,603 --> 02:35:54,035
TALIESIN: Okay, because I moved. Bomb, then ran.

2381
02:35:54,035 --> 02:35:55,475
SAM: There's smoke between them.

2382
02:35:55,475 --> 02:35:56,506
TALIESIN: There's smoke between us.

2383
02:35:56,506 --> 02:36:01,923
MATT: In this area? Oh, yeah, so she would look
around, get out of the way, look for you, sees

2384
02:36:01,923 --> 02:36:04,319
nothing but a bear that has climbed to the top.

2385
02:36:04,352 --> 02:36:06,191
TALIESIN: I turned into a bear. It's Willow!

2386
02:36:06,191 --> 02:36:08,945
LIAM: Is it a bear, or is it fat Percy?

2387
02:36:08,945 --> 02:36:10,595
TALIESIN: It's fat Percy.

2388
02:36:10,595 --> 02:36:16,846
MATT: Technically, it is. She looks very confused
for a second. "Percy?"

2389
02:36:16,846 --> 02:36:22,275
LIAM: Wait, question! Am I still Percy?

2390
02:36:22,275 --> 02:36:24,186
LAURA: You still look like Percy.

2391
02:36:24,186 --> 02:36:29,110
LIAM: If she's fooled by a fat Percy, she's surely
fooled by a svelte Percy. Does she think she has

2392
02:36:29,110 --> 02:36:30,374
Percy? What's going on?

2393
02:36:30,374 --> 02:36:33,167
MATT: This Seeming spell has fucked everything
up.

2394
02:36:33,167 --> 02:36:36,008
(laughter)

2395
02:36:36,008 --> 02:36:45,232
MATT: No. They can still see the illusion, but you
get the sense that she can see through it, meaning

2396
02:36:45,232 --> 02:36:47,384
it's almost like the two layers are over top.

2397
02:36:47,384 --> 02:36:50,872
LIAM: So she can see big Percy, but realizes it's
not big Percy.

2398
02:36:50,872 --> 02:36:51,824
MATT: It's not big Percy.

2399
02:36:51,824 --> 02:36:52,832
LIAM: It's just absurd.

2400
02:36:52,832 --> 02:36:55,955
MATT: She can see a bear wearing a Percy costume,
is how it looks to her.

2401
02:36:55,955 --> 02:37:00,112
TALIESIN: That's a bear wearing a Percy costume.

2402
02:37:00,112 --> 02:37:04,626
MATT: She actually looks around and sees the weird
Percy, sees nobody else in the area-- she can't

2403
02:37:04,626 --> 02:37:09,427
see you because of your stealth, even though the
Conjure Barrage was in the middle of the fog

2404
02:37:09,427 --> 02:37:13,432
cloud, it prevented her from keeping sight on
anybody, and you're out of the way, so the only

2405
02:37:13,432 --> 02:37:15,817
thing she can see right now is weird Trinket.

2406
02:37:15,817 --> 02:37:17,428
LAURA: I wanted to use my bonus action to hide.

2407
02:37:17,428 --> 02:37:23,995
LIAM: I see her confused look, and I call out,
we're all Percy! Get it?

2408
02:37:23,995 --> 02:37:27,678
LAURA: 29.

2409
02:37:27,678 --> 02:37:37,993
MATT: Okay, good to know. She, not really knowing
what to do, goes, "Sylas. Take this boon." She

2410
02:37:37,993 --> 02:37:40,163
puts her hand out, and you can see a bit of dust
form in there.

2411
02:37:40,163 --> 02:37:41,625
MARISHA: Take this spoon?

2412
02:37:41,625 --> 02:37:42,630
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Boon.

2413
02:37:42,630 --> 02:37:44,208
MARISHA and TALIESIN: This spoon!

2414
02:37:44,208 --> 02:37:50,792
MATT: She casts a spell on him. That ends her
turn. And then she steps back into the side of the

2415
02:37:50,792 --> 02:37:51,920
fog there.

2416
02:37:51,920 --> 02:37:53,401
TRAVIS: She inspired him?

2417
02:37:53,401 --> 02:37:55,059
MATT: You don't know.

2418
02:37:55,059 --> 02:37:56,274
LAURA: She helped him.

2419
02:37:56,274 --> 02:37:57,504
MATT: Scanlan, you're up.

2420
02:37:57,504 --> 02:37:59,794
SAM: All right, I hear talking?

2421
02:37:59,794 --> 02:38:01,880
MATT: You hear talking. You come around the
corner?

2422
02:38:01,880 --> 02:38:03,145
SAM: I come around the corner.

2423
02:38:03,145 --> 02:38:05,584
MATT: Okay, you're about here, so you can move
forward.

2424
02:38:05,584 --> 02:38:12,580
SAM: The second I see her, Delilah, I will cast
Lightning Bolt on her.

2425
02:38:12,580 --> 02:38:14,020
MATT: Okay.

2426
02:38:14,020 --> 02:38:15,855
LAURA: Lightning Bolt? She's immune.

2427
02:38:15,855 --> 02:38:17,326
SAM: I don't know anything.

2428
02:38:17,326 --> 02:38:20,560
MATT: All right, you see her jump back into the
cloud, and you unleash.

2429
02:38:20,560 --> 02:38:23,529
SAM: Actually, are they in a line? Is there a way
I could get in a line?

2430
02:38:23,529 --> 02:38:29,058
MATT: Not with this pillar there, no. This
pillar's blocking the way. Right now, you're only seeing

2431
02:38:29,058 --> 02:38:33,373
her, at this point, since she goes into this fog
cloud, so you can throw it in the direction she

2432
02:38:33,443 --> 02:38:34,888
is, if you want to.

2433
02:38:34,888 --> 02:38:37,450
SAM: I wouldn't know anything about her, so yeah.
I blast.

2434
02:38:37,450 --> 02:38:40,337
MATT: You release the bolt of lightning. Roll 8d6
damage.

2435
02:38:40,337 --> 02:38:41,871
TALIESIN: Were you there for that fight?

2436
02:38:41,871 --> 02:38:42,865
SAM: I don't know. Was I?

2437
02:38:42,865 --> 02:38:44,311
LAURA: Yeah, you were there for that fight.

2438
02:38:44,311 --> 02:38:45,649
SAM: Would I know anything?

2439
02:38:45,649 --> 02:38:46,611
LIAM: That was ages ago.

2440
02:38:46,611 --> 02:38:47,769
LAURA: It was a long time ago.

2441
02:38:47,769 --> 02:38:52,035
MATT: You recall that lightning seemed to not have
the impact it usually does.

2442
02:38:52,035 --> 02:38:53,739
SAM: Would I know that enough not to cast it?

2443
02:38:53,739 --> 02:39:00,055
MATT: I would say, through all the thoughts and
preparation for this fight, if you would like to

2444
02:39:00,055 --> 02:39:03,144
rescind that, you would be ready to Lightning Bolt
and be like, "Wait, no. That didn't work."

2445
02:39:03,144 --> 02:39:16,655
SAM: All right, then undo. I will undo, and I will
instead-- I will try to blind her.

2446
02:39:16,655 --> 02:39:18,345
MATT: Okay.

2447
02:39:18,345 --> 02:39:23,333
TALIESIN: That's a great idea. Spectacularly great
idea.

2448
02:39:23,333 --> 02:39:28,399
LAURA: Silence her would be good, too.

2449
02:39:28,399 --> 02:39:32,085
SAM: Through my Hand Cone of Clarity.

2450
02:39:32,085 --> 02:39:34,892
MATT: All right. What's the saving throw on that
one?

2451
02:39:34,892 --> 02:39:36,313
SAM: It would be 19.

2452
02:39:36,313 --> 02:39:41,066
MATT: And what is the saving throw? Is it wisdom?

2453
02:39:41,066 --> 02:39:49,371
SAM: Oh, I'm sorry. Blindness. Oh, Jesus. I never
use it, so I don't know. Blindness is a

2454
02:39:49,371 --> 02:39:50,943
constitution saving throw.

2455
02:39:50,943 --> 02:39:54,075
MATT: Constitution for Delilah. Yeah, she makes
it.

2456
02:39:54,075 --> 02:39:55,607
SAM: She makes it?

2457
02:39:55,607 --> 02:39:58,309
MATT: Rolled 18 plus three. 21.

2458
02:39:58,309 --> 02:39:59,526
MARISHA: Bitch.

2459
02:39:59,526 --> 02:40:02,924
SAM: So I wave at her.

2460
02:40:02,924 --> 02:40:04,997
(laughter)

2461
02:40:04,997 --> 02:40:05,825
SAM: Hi.

2462
02:40:05,825 --> 02:40:07,617
MATT: She vanishes into the smoke cloud that Percy
had left.

2463
02:40:07,617 --> 02:40:09,021
SAM: Is that my movement?

2464
02:40:09,021 --> 02:40:11,665
MATT: You can move a little closer if you want
to.

2465
02:40:11,665 --> 02:40:14,356
SAM: Can I get the pillar between us?

2466
02:40:14,356 --> 02:40:15,448
MATT: You can get there.

2467
02:40:15,448 --> 02:40:17,900
SAM: And can I see anyone else?

2468
02:40:17,900 --> 02:40:18,674
MATT: No.

2469
02:40:18,674 --> 02:40:19,925
SAM: Okay. Then that's it.

2470
02:40:19,925 --> 02:40:23,042
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn, Scanlan. Vax,
you're up.

2471
02:40:23,042 --> 02:40:26,658
LIAM: What do I do in this situation? I trust
them, but I also trust them?

2472
02:40:26,658 --> 02:40:34,025
MATT: You trust them both, and right now, they've
made an aggressive action against the Briarwoods.

2473
02:40:34,025 --> 02:40:37,665
The next one you see, you're probably going to
go ahead and try to make an aggressive action.

2474
02:40:37,665 --> 02:40:44,760
LIAM: I'm going to do whatever you tell me. Were I
to see her, the most important person to me in the

2475
02:40:44,850 --> 02:40:50,671
world, act on Lady Briarwood, I'd be like,
"What's up, that's Lady Briarwood, kill her?"

2476
02:40:50,671 --> 02:40:56,296
MATT: You would try and attack her to try to
convince her to stop the assault, probably.

2477
02:40:56,296 --> 02:40:59,518
LIAM: Okay, and I've seen Trinket and I've seen
Scanlan?

2478
02:40:59,518 --> 02:41:00,503
MATT: You've seen Percy.

2479
02:41:00,503 --> 02:41:01,539
LIAM: I've seen Percy?

2480
02:41:01,539 --> 02:41:04,901
MATT: Scanlan you haven't seen yet. You're still
inside this cloud. All you've seen is Percy. You

2481
02:41:04,901 --> 02:41:08,174
didn't even see her strike at you, other than
seeing the arrows flying in so you know it's her.

2482
02:41:08,174 --> 02:41:12,541
LIAM: Then I'm going to step right in front of
Lady Briarwood and shield her with my body from

2483
02:41:12,541 --> 02:41:13,674
Percy.

2484
02:41:13,674 --> 02:41:14,943
MATT: Okay.

2485
02:41:14,943 --> 02:41:19,900
LIAM: Percival, you've got to stop. This is
madness! This is that spirit of yours.

2486
02:41:19,900 --> 02:41:22,150
MATT: Grog.

2487
02:41:22,150 --> 02:41:24,427
TRAVIS: Can they see me?

2488
02:41:24,427 --> 02:41:29,616
MATT: You're just now coming around the side here,
so it's hard to tell.

2489
02:41:29,616 --> 02:41:31,131
You see a big cloud of smoke.

2490
02:41:31,131 --> 02:41:34,242
TRAVIS: I'm going to hold my turn.

2491
02:41:34,242 --> 02:41:36,668
MATT: You're not going to get any closer?

2492
02:41:36,668 --> 02:41:40,204
TRAVIS: I'd like to put my back against the
column.

2493
02:41:40,204 --> 02:41:44,071
MATT: You use double movement to--

2494
02:41:44,071 --> 02:41:45,503
LAURA: Fall over. And then?

2495
02:41:45,503 --> 02:41:52,357
MATT: To move right there behind the pillar with
your back to it. Okay. That gets us to Sylas.

2496
02:41:52,357 --> 02:41:54,297
MARISHA: Oh boy.

2497
02:41:54,297 --> 02:42:00,617
MATT: Leaping out of the smoke, (whoosh) with an
unnatural speed, Sylas, jumping in the air,

2498
02:42:00,617 --> 02:42:06,227
pulling from the scabbard on his back a long, onyx
two-handed sword you've seen once before. Leaps

2499
02:42:06,227 --> 02:42:08,258
and lands right before you, Percy.

2500
02:42:08,258 --> 02:42:10,626
TALIESIN: He can see me? He can find me in the
smoke?

2501
02:42:10,626 --> 02:42:14,442
MATT: He leapt out of the smoke.

2502
02:42:14,509 --> 02:42:16,047
TALIESIN: Okay.

2503
02:42:16,047 --> 02:42:25,029
MATT: And has a really high passive perception. He
leaps and lands right before you with this grin on

2504
02:42:25,029 --> 02:42:30,918
his face, the blade out in front of him, and says,
"Boy, you poke where you shouldn't." And goes in

2505
02:42:30,918 --> 02:42:45,674
for three attacks on you with his blade. That's a
natural two, so 12? Oh, no that would be 14? That

2506
02:42:45,674 --> 02:42:48,347
is a 34?

2507
02:42:48,347 --> 02:42:51,869
TALIESIN: 34 hits. The other two do not.

2508
02:42:51,869 --> 02:42:53,373
MATT: Oh, 24?

2509
02:42:53,373 --> 02:42:54,878
TALIESIN: 24 still hits.

2510
02:42:54,878 --> 02:42:57,512
MATT: And then that would be his turn, so two
hits.

2511
02:42:57,512 --> 02:42:59,437
SAM: Slow him down.

2512
02:42:59,437 --> 02:43:09,077
MATT: You take 13 points of slashing damage from
the first strike, and then you take ten points of

2513
02:43:09,077 --> 02:43:10,799
slashing damage from the second strike.

2514
02:43:10,799 --> 02:43:12,498
TALIESIN: That's 26 points.

2515
02:43:12,498 --> 02:43:14,077
MATT: I need you to make two constitution saving
throws.

2516
02:43:14,077 --> 02:43:17,076
TALIESIN: 23 points of damage.

2517
02:43:17,076 --> 02:43:19,219
MATT: And make two constitution saving throws.

2518
02:43:19,219 --> 02:43:29,616
TALIESIN: Sorry, just updating my sad little hit
points. Two constitution saving throws?

2519
02:43:29,616 --> 02:43:30,896
MATT: Correct.

2520
02:43:30,896 --> 02:43:36,878
TALIESIN: 11?

2521
02:43:36,878 --> 02:43:38,606
MATT: Okay, and the second one?

2522
02:43:38,606 --> 02:43:43,372
TALIESIN: A critical fail.

2523
02:43:43,372 --> 02:43:47,607
MATT: Okay. You feel as each strike of the blade
cuts into your flesh, a portion of your body's

2524
02:43:47,607 --> 02:43:51,627
strength is sapped from it. Your strength goes
down by two.

2525
02:43:51,627 --> 02:43:54,100
TALIESIN: My strength is a negative one.

2526
02:43:54,100 --> 02:43:56,780
MATT: No, I mean your score. Not the modifier,
your score.

2527
02:43:56,780 --> 02:44:00,887
TALIESIN: Oh, so my strength is at zero, then.

2528
02:44:00,887 --> 02:44:02,455
MATT: What is your strength normally?

2529
02:44:02,455 --> 02:44:03,394
TALIESIN: 12.

2530
02:44:03,394 --> 02:44:04,541
MATT: 12, so it's now ten.

2531
02:44:04,541 --> 02:44:06,934
TALIESIN: It's now ten, which means my modifier is
zero.

2532
02:44:06,934 --> 02:44:09,671
MATT: You see the energy fill him now.

2533
02:44:09,671 --> 02:44:13,793
TRAVIS: I'd take that turn now, if I could.

2534
02:44:13,793 --> 02:44:18,166
MATT: You used your movement and you held your
action. You can now take your action.

2535
02:44:18,166 --> 02:44:19,868
LIAM: Break his head like a melon.

2536
02:44:19,868 --> 02:44:21,821
TRAVIS: I can't get to him now. I used my
movement.

2537
02:44:21,821 --> 02:44:23,993
LIAM and LAURA: Chain!

2538
02:44:23,993 --> 02:44:28,383
TRAVIS: I'll use the Chain of Returning, with the
holy oil on the war hammer.

2539
02:44:28,383 --> 02:44:33,921
MATT: Okay, so as you're behind the pillar, you
see him rush up and slash into Percy. You reach

2540
02:44:33,921 --> 02:44:36,864
around and (throwing noise) release the axe,
spinning towards him with the chain behind it. Not

2541
02:44:36,864 --> 02:44:38,255
the axe, the hammer.

2542
02:44:38,255 --> 02:44:40,526
TRAVIS: 27.

2543
02:44:40,526 --> 02:44:41,483
MATT: That hits.

2544
02:44:41,483 --> 02:44:42,791
LIAM: Get him.

2545
02:44:42,791 --> 02:44:45,008
SAM: That's the first Briarwood damage.

2546
02:44:45,008 --> 02:44:56,210
TRAVIS: 15 damage with the fire and the holy oil
does an extra--

2547
02:44:56,210 --> 02:44:57,329
MATT: 1d4.

2548
02:44:57,329 --> 02:44:59,476
TRAVIS: 16.

2549
02:44:59,476 --> 02:45:04,481
MATT: Okay. 16 points of damage on the strike.
(impact sounds). It slams into him from the side.

2550
02:45:04,481 --> 02:45:09,275
He looks over and you can see where it hit;
there's a burst of radiant energy that's burning

2551
02:45:09,275 --> 02:45:13,633
into his side. He glances down at you with a
frustrated look. Go ahead and make your save to

2552
02:45:13,633 --> 02:45:16,149
try and pull your hammer back.

2553
02:45:16,149 --> 02:45:20,019
TRAVIS: That's a 21.

2554
02:45:20,019 --> 02:45:22,839
MATT: Okay. So that finishes that turn. Pike,
you're up.

2555
02:45:22,904 --> 02:45:29,922
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to use Healing Word for
Percy.

2556
02:45:29,985 --> 02:45:34,757
MATT: You have to get within range of him though.
You're on the opposite side of the battlefield,

2557
02:45:34,757 --> 02:45:40,225
so, at full movement you'd be there; with the
range on Healing Word, you wouldn't be able to get

2558
02:45:40,294 --> 02:45:42,313
to him right now in time.

2559
02:45:42,313 --> 02:45:45,932
ASHLEY: Even with a 60-foot range? Am I close?

2560
02:45:45,932 --> 02:45:47,468
MATT: 60 foot?

2561
02:45:47,468 --> 02:45:50,034
SAM: She can't see anything, so she's 80 feet
away.

2562
02:45:50,034 --> 02:45:54,712
MATT: Almost. He's 15 feet outside of your range.
Unless you use your Sprinter's Boots.

2563
02:45:54,712 --> 02:45:59,276
ASHLEY: I'll use my Sprinter's Boots.

2564
02:45:59,329 --> 02:46:00,766
MATT: Okay.

2565
02:46:00,766 --> 02:46:06,649
SAM: Oh god. Just know Ashley, that sprinting in
like this will take you right in front of the

2566
02:46:06,649 --> 02:46:07,632
Briarwoods.

2567
02:46:07,632 --> 02:46:09,349
ASHLEY: Oh, because I can't see the board.

2568
02:46:09,349 --> 02:46:12,355
LAURA: Yeah, that's not a good thing. Maybe it's
better to--

2569
02:46:12,355 --> 02:46:15,138
MARISHA: Can you help Vax? You're really close to
Vax.

2570
02:46:15,138 --> 02:46:17,562
ASHLEY: Oh, am I close to Vax?

2571
02:46:17,562 --> 02:46:20,802
MATT: You are near Vax, yeah.

2572
02:46:20,802 --> 02:46:28,199
ASHLEY: Can I get right behind him and cast
Greater Restoration on him?

2573
02:46:28,199 --> 02:46:32,305
MATT: You can. The fog obscures them; they have
three quarters cover. You can still see their

2574
02:46:32,305 --> 02:46:34,736
shapes in the cloud, it's not completely
obscured.

2575
02:46:34,736 --> 02:46:39,616
LIAM: And there's a pillar between you and me in
the middle of a 30-foot stretch.

2576
02:46:39,616 --> 02:46:42,591
LAURA: So you can hide behind it after you
cast it.

2577
02:46:42,683 --> 02:46:43,948
ASHLEY: Can I try that?

2578
02:46:44,012 --> 02:46:48,527
MATT: You can. So you rush up, around the pillar,
clicking your Sprinter's Boots to give the

2579
02:46:48,527 --> 02:46:53,056
distance, you rush up into the cloud, right into
the face of Vax. And Vax, you look down at Pike,

2580
02:46:53,056 --> 02:46:56,489
now aggressively coming towards you. Protecting
Lady Briarwood, you pull your daggers out

2581
02:46:56,489 --> 02:47:01,704
instinctively and look down at her with a look of
"What are you doing?" You reach forward and reach

2582
02:47:01,704 --> 02:47:12,089
out your hands against him. Let me check
Restoration real fast. Let me see here, Greater

2583
02:47:12,089 --> 02:47:20,888
Restoration. 5th level. Ends effects like charmed
or petrified. As you reach out and touch him you

2584
02:47:20,888 --> 02:47:27,140
feel the impact of the Briarwoods' influence fade
from your mind. As she touches you, the charm is

2585
02:47:27,140 --> 02:47:32,591
dispelled and you look at your daggers and look
where you are and look at the moments and the last

2586
02:47:32,591 --> 02:47:34,253
few minutes and you're like--

2587
02:47:34,253 --> 02:47:40,105
LIAM: Then can I look up and stay in a defensive
stance and back towards Lady Briarwood?

2588
02:47:40,105 --> 02:47:41,357
SAM: Oh, feigning?

2589
02:47:41,357 --> 02:47:45,400
MATT: You know what, make a deception check.

2590
02:47:45,400 --> 02:47:47,847
TRAVIS: (laughing) Slick!

2591
02:47:47,847 --> 02:47:50,622
LIAM: 12.

2592
02:47:50,622 --> 02:47:57,757
MATT: Okay. You back up into a defensive position
towards Lady Briarwood. Okay, that's just from

2593
02:47:57,757 --> 02:48:00,886
immediate reaction to that. Pike, do you want to
stay where you are, do you want to use the rest of

2594
02:48:00,886 --> 02:48:03,200
your movement to move back behind the pillar?

2595
02:48:03,200 --> 02:48:04,086
TRAVIS: Cover.

2596
02:48:04,086 --> 02:48:05,514
ASHLEY: I'll move back behind the pillar.

2597
02:48:05,514 --> 02:48:08,923
MATT: Okay. All right.

2598
02:48:08,923 --> 02:48:10,774
SAM: Any bonus moves there, Pikey?

2599
02:48:10,774 --> 02:48:14,366
ASHLEY: No. I'm going to wait.

2600
02:48:14,366 --> 02:48:15,978
MATT: Vex, you're up.

2601
02:48:15,978 --> 02:48:27,491
LAURA: Me? I'm going to shoot my storm arrow. I'm
going to shoot from my Longbow of the Sky

2602
02:48:27,491 --> 02:48:34,857
Sentinel. At Lord Briarwood. At Sylas.

2603
02:48:34,857 --> 02:48:36,344
MATT: Okay, go for it.

2604
02:48:36,344 --> 02:48:46,359
LAURA: Okay. Well, Percy. That one didn't work.
That's a natural one for the first. That's three

2605
02:48:46,359 --> 02:48:50,194
arrows, though. The second one's good, that's a
25.

2606
02:48:50,194 --> 02:48:51,655
MATT: All right, that hits.

2607
02:48:51,655 --> 02:48:55,269
LAURA: And the last one is a 29.

2608
02:48:55,269 --> 02:48:56,627
MATT: Okay, those two hit.

2609
02:48:56,627 --> 02:49:18,527
LAURA: Okay, so that is an extra 1d6 lightning
damage for every attack. 15 for the first one, and

2610
02:49:18,527 --> 02:49:24,997
then... 15 for the second one.

2611
02:49:24,997 --> 02:49:26,635
MATT: Okay.

2612
02:49:26,635 --> 02:49:32,624
LAURA: And that was -- Oh no. Yeah, that's it. And
that's the first attack. The second attack is

2613
02:49:32,624 --> 02:49:33,676
another shot.

2614
02:49:33,676 --> 02:49:34,755
MATT: Correct.

2615
02:49:34,755 --> 02:49:38,293
LAURA: With a holy arrow. At him again.

2616
02:49:38,293 --> 02:49:39,291
MATT: Yup.

2617
02:49:39,291 --> 02:49:41,378
LAURA: Okay, so 25.

2618
02:49:41,378 --> 02:49:42,501
MATT: That hits.

2619
02:49:42,501 --> 02:49:43,547
LAURA: Okay.

2620
02:49:43,547 --> 02:49:45,318
MATT: Keyleth, what was your initiative again?

2621
02:49:45,318 --> 02:49:49,302
MARISHA: Bringing up the rears.

2622
02:49:49,302 --> 02:49:50,261
MATT: Yeah.

2623
02:49:50,261 --> 02:49:52,987
LAURA: 15, for the last hit, too.

2624
02:49:52,987 --> 02:49:57,374
MATT: Nice. All right, so as you're floating up
above you pull back your arrow and inciting the

2625
02:49:57,374 --> 02:50:03,032
magical enchantment of the bow, you release and as
it does it (crack crack) crackles with energy and

2626
02:50:03,032 --> 02:50:07,473
splits into three separate arrows that arc around
each other almost like a helix of DNA. As they all

2627
02:50:07,473 --> 02:50:11,780
streak downward they (impact noises) slam into
Sylas from the other side him now being assaulted

2628
02:50:11,780 --> 02:50:13,964
on all fronts.

2629
02:50:13,964 --> 02:50:18,299
LAURA: I use my bonus action to hide again.

2630
02:50:18,508 --> 02:50:24,151
MATT: Okay. Well you're still out in plain sight.
Unless you're pulling way, way back. If you want

2631
02:50:24,151 --> 02:50:25,773
to pull back towards the shadow.

2632
02:50:25,773 --> 02:50:26,815
LAURA: I want to hide.

2633
02:50:26,815 --> 02:50:30,124
MATT: Okay. So you pull further and further away
from it. Go ahead and make a stealth check.

2634
02:50:30,124 --> 02:50:33,467
TRAVIS: Flying Vex is pretty dope. (laughs)

2635
02:50:33,467 --> 02:50:35,332
LAURA: Natural 20.

2636
02:50:35,332 --> 02:50:37,872
(cheering)

2637
02:50:37,872 --> 02:50:42,056
MATT: Vanish into the shadow of the sky. You dart
out of the darkness and then disappear back into

2638
02:50:42,056 --> 02:50:47,474
it. All right. That ends your turn. Percy, you're
up.

2639
02:50:47,474 --> 02:51:02,694
TALIESIN: I just got blasted. What's that thing I
can do? I'm going to use a bonus action to do my

2640
02:51:02,694 --> 02:51:04,792
little healing surge that I can do.

2641
02:51:04,792 --> 02:51:05,978
MATT: Okay.

2642
02:51:05,978 --> 02:51:13,693
TALIESIN: My fighter ability thing, which is 1d10
plus 12, so that's 18 points of damage back.

2643
02:51:13,693 --> 02:51:15,069
MATT: Okay.

2644
02:51:15,069 --> 02:51:16,131
SAM: Nice.

2645
02:51:16,131 --> 02:51:17,579
MARISHA: Good roll.

2646
02:51:17,579 --> 02:51:20,323
SAM: Catch that, Pike? He healed himself.

2647
02:51:20,323 --> 02:51:30,840
TALIESIN: I brought myself up a little bit. Just a
little bit. And I'm going to shove the Diplomacy

2648
02:51:30,840 --> 02:51:38,544
glove right into Sylas's face and try and do a
straight shove to get him off of me. I have never

2649
02:51:38,544 --> 02:51:41,478
used this before. I don't actually know how it
works.

2650
02:51:41,478 --> 02:51:46,346
MATT: Right, and you previously charged this--

2651
02:51:46,346 --> 02:51:50,431
TALISIN: I charged this when I got hit by the
lightning attack in the crypt.

2652
02:51:50,431 --> 02:51:52,092
MARISHA: Oh, that's right!

2653
02:51:52,092 --> 02:51:58,571
MATT: Go ahead and make a melee attack. So this
would be, I'd say--

2654
02:51:58,571 --> 02:51:59,791
TALIESIN: Dex check?

2655
02:51:59,791 --> 02:52:05,784
MATT: I'd say make it dex-based because it's more
of a quick grab on your end. Make a d12 plus your

2656
02:52:05,784 --> 02:52:11,151
proficiency, plus your dex. So plus ten. It's plus
ten.

2657
02:52:11,240 --> 02:52:12,320
TALIESIN: Plus ten to a d20.

2658
02:52:12,320 --> 02:52:13,863
MATT: Yes, you got it.

2659
02:52:13,863 --> 02:52:15,811
TALIESIN: Thank you! That's much better. 22.

2660
02:52:15,811 --> 02:52:22,322
MATT: 22 will hit! So as you reach out and grab
him in the front the energy pulses in front as it

2661
02:52:22,322 --> 02:52:32,821
releases. Go ahead and roll 4d6 points of damage.
Did not make his saving throw on that with a

2662
02:52:32,821 --> 02:52:34,318
four.

2663
02:52:34,318 --> 02:52:41,263
MARISHA: Oh my god! He rolled three sixes and a
five.

2664
02:52:41,263 --> 02:52:45,654
TALIESIN: 23 points of damage.

2665
02:52:45,654 --> 02:52:53,208
MATT: All righty. The shock charges through his
dark armor he (groans). You can see that the dark

2666
02:52:53,259 --> 02:52:59,143
veins pulse through his neck as the energy surges
through his body. He slaps the hand away at this

2667
02:52:59,143 --> 02:53:05,895
point and you can see the smoke and it's (hissing)
off the armor. (growls)

2668
02:53:05,990 --> 02:53:08,485
SAM: Hi.

2669
02:53:08,485 --> 02:53:12,320
MARISHA: What you going to do?

2670
02:53:12,320 --> 02:53:19,138
TALIESIN: I'm going to, Jesus Christ, okay! I
can't really use my gun because I'm too close. I'm

2671
02:53:19,138 --> 02:53:24,960
going to pull out my sword and take two more
slashes and I'm going to run like a mother.

2672
02:53:24,960 --> 02:53:26,037
MATT: Okay.

2673
02:53:26,037 --> 02:53:31,489
TALIESIN: First slash is a 28.

2674
02:53:31,489 --> 02:53:32,775
MATT: Hit.

2675
02:53:32,775 --> 02:53:39,208
TALIESIN: And that's lame. That's 14 points of
damage.

2676
02:53:39,208 --> 02:53:40,376
MATT: Okay.

2677
02:53:40,376 --> 02:53:44,418
TALIESIN: Second slash is 23.

2678
02:53:44,418 --> 02:53:47,366
MATT: 23? Okay, it hits.

2679
02:53:47,366 --> 02:53:52,585
TALIESIN: And that's 11 points of damage. Now I'm
going to book it towards Grog.

2680
02:53:52,585 --> 02:53:58,141
MATT: Okay. You're bolting towards Grog. He's
going to swing at you with the sword as an attack

2681
02:53:58,141 --> 02:54:01,687
of opportunity as he does so. That is 21 to hit.

2682
02:54:01,687 --> 02:54:02,778
TALIESIN: That hits.

2683
02:54:02,778 --> 02:54:11,582
MATT: All right. You take 17 points of slashing
damage as the sword arcs across your back. You

2684
02:54:11,582 --> 02:54:14,640
rush towards Grog on that side. Roll another
constitution saving throw.

2685
02:54:14,640 --> 02:54:17,375
SAM: Oh no. The strength thing.

2686
02:54:17,375 --> 02:54:18,386
TALIESIN: I know.

2687
02:54:18,386 --> 02:54:19,853
MARISHA: Good thing you don't use strength.

2688
02:54:19,853 --> 02:54:20,863
TALIESIN: No.

2689
02:54:20,863 --> 02:54:22,231
SAM: Well, it can still kill you.

2690
02:54:22,231 --> 02:54:27,410
TALIESIN: 15, 16, 17. 22.

2691
02:54:27,410 --> 02:54:32,838
MATT: Okay, you resist the effects of the blade
now, having saved from it. That ends your turn. At

2692
02:54:32,838 --> 02:54:38,283
the end of your turn, Sylas is going to go ahead
and spend one of his legendary actions to get a

2693
02:54:38,283 --> 02:54:45,125
free movement without provoking attacks of
opportunity and shift up with an amazing speed to

2694
02:54:45,125 --> 02:54:50,483
the other side of both. As soon as you rush over
to Grog he appears up in front of you grinning

2695
02:54:50,483 --> 02:54:55,244
with his blade at the ready, right next to you and
Grog. That ends your turn.

2696
02:54:55,244 --> 02:54:57,473
It's now Cassandra's turn.

2697
02:54:57,473 --> 02:55:00,530
MARISHA: Oh, god damn it, what are you going to do?

2698
02:55:00,530 --> 02:55:04,065
TALIESIN: Make the right decision, girl!

2699
02:55:04,065 --> 02:55:06,127
MATT: Roll a perception check, Percy.

2700
02:55:06,127 --> 02:55:07,302
LAURA: Oh!

2701
02:55:07,302 --> 02:55:12,203
TALIESIN: (blows raspberry) Nine.

2702
02:55:12,203 --> 02:55:14,243
MATT: Nine? Roll a perception check, Grog.

2703
02:55:14,243 --> 02:55:16,019
MARISHA: Come on, Grog.

2704
02:55:16,019 --> 02:55:18,584
TRAVIS: 11.

2705
02:55:18,584 --> 02:55:26,788
MATT: Okay. Seemingly out of nowhere, Cassandra
appears from behind the pillar, blade out,

2706
02:55:26,788 --> 02:55:30,088
shortsword at the ready, and attempts to jam it
into the back of Grog.

2707
02:55:30,088 --> 02:55:32,190
LAURA: Sneak Attack damage. She's a rogue!

2708
02:55:32,190 --> 02:55:33,904
MATT: That is 21 to hit.

2709
02:55:33,904 --> 02:55:35,236
TRAVIS: That actually hits me.

2710
02:55:35,236 --> 02:55:36,439
MATT: Okay.

2711
02:55:36,439 --> 02:55:44,667
MARISHA: You can hear all the dice he's picking
up.

2712
02:55:44,752 --> 02:55:48,193
TALIESIN: Oh, goddamn it.

2713
02:55:48,412 --> 02:55:52,216
MATT: 27 points of piercing damage.

2714
02:55:52,216 --> 02:55:53,865
TRAVIS: Halved, because I'm raging.

2715
02:55:53,865 --> 02:55:56,269
MATT: Slashing damage because it's a sword, but
yeah, halved.

2716
02:55:56,269 --> 02:55:58,685
TRAVIS: 13?

2717
02:55:58,685 --> 02:56:01,624
MATT: 13 points of slashing damage from the sneak
attack.

2718
02:56:01,624 --> 02:56:03,014
TALIESIN: That could have been worse.

2719
02:56:03,014 --> 02:56:10,678
MATT: That will end Cassandra's turn. Next up is
Keyleth.

2720
02:56:10,678 --> 02:56:14,503
MARISHA: Oh! Finally. Okay, running up the stairs,
running up the stairs--

2721
02:56:14,503 --> 02:56:18,998
MATT: Well, you've been waiting around the side
here for everyone, so you're just now cresting

2722
02:56:18,998 --> 02:56:20,231
around that corner.

2723
02:56:20,231 --> 02:56:26,562
MARISHA: Beautiful. Can I move to where I'm in a
nice pretty line with a Briarwood and Cassandra?

2724
02:56:26,562 --> 02:56:32,346
Over here? And Sunbeam!

2725
02:56:32,346 --> 02:56:33,856
MATT: Okay.

2726
02:56:33,856 --> 02:56:34,952
ASHLEY: Yes!

2727
02:56:34,952 --> 02:56:37,058
TALIESIN: (sings) Deo gratias!

2728
02:56:37,058 --> 02:56:38,582
MARISHA: Right in a line.

2729
02:56:38,582 --> 02:56:43,326
SAM: Do it. This is it. This is everything, right
here.

2730
02:56:43,326 --> 02:56:44,612
LIAM: Come on, Kiki.

2731
02:56:44,612 --> 02:56:45,971
TALIESIN: You're our cannon.

2732
02:56:45,971 --> 02:56:47,535
MARISHA: I've been waiting.

2733
02:56:47,535 --> 02:56:55,496
MATT: Sunbeam. Yeah, it will hit both him and
Cassandra and Grog.

2734
02:56:55,496 --> 02:56:57,230
SAM: And Grog?

2735
02:56:57,230 --> 02:56:58,648
TRAVIS: Who cares?

2736
02:56:58,648 --> 02:57:02,486
MATT: All right, so a constitution saving throw,
Grog.

2737
02:57:02,486 --> 02:57:03,723
TRAVIS: Constitution.

2738
02:57:03,723 --> 02:57:09,037
MATT: Cassandra makes it with a 21.

2739
02:57:09,037 --> 02:57:10,334
TRAVIS: 16?

2740
02:57:10,334 --> 02:57:11,713
MATT: 16. What's your DC?

2741
02:57:11,713 --> 02:57:12,930
MARISHA: 17.

2742
02:57:12,930 --> 02:57:17,477
MATT: So full damage on Grog, half damage on
Cassandra. I mean no damage. She's going to use

2743
02:57:17,477 --> 02:57:24,758
her reaction to use Uncanny Dodge, so Cassandra
takes no damage from it. Sylas is going to use one

2744
02:57:24,823 --> 02:57:30,234
of his legendary resistances to automatically
succeed on his saving throw, so he takes half

2745
02:57:30,234 --> 02:57:38,236
damage. Oh, they had disadvantage on the saving
throw, but he can automatically make it,

2746
02:57:38,236 --> 02:57:39,551
so never mind.

2747
02:57:39,551 --> 02:57:44,850
MARISHA: 15 plus eight, so that's 23. 23.

2748
02:57:44,850 --> 02:57:45,892
MATT: 23 damage?

2749
02:57:45,892 --> 02:57:46,707
MARISHA: Yes.

2750
02:57:46,707 --> 02:57:57,153
MATT: Okay, halved. He takes 12 points of radiant
damage. So as you rush around the corner, he sees

2751
02:57:57,153 --> 02:58:02,140
you appear again and gives you a look. As the beam
of light appears, his eyes roll back in fear, and

2752
02:58:02,140 --> 02:58:05,802
the blast (fire noise) streaks out, blasting into
Grog, blasting into him--

2753
02:58:05,802 --> 02:58:08,457
MARISHA: Undead and oozes have disadvantage on
saving throws.

2754
02:58:08,457 --> 02:58:12,103
MATT: Correct, but he has the ability to
automatically make the saving throw, as a

2755
02:58:12,103 --> 02:58:17,592
legendary creature. However, as the beam fades,
you can see part of his face is burned to ash, and

2756
02:58:17,592 --> 02:58:21,050
you can see where the lip is gone, the teeth are
exposed, and the sharp fangs.

2757
02:58:21,050 --> 02:58:26,834
MARISHA: And I don't know if this makes any amount
of difference, but for the duration of the spell,

2758
02:58:26,834 --> 02:58:31,900
I have a 30-foot radius sunlight glowing in my
hand.

2759
02:58:31,900 --> 02:58:32,991
MATT: Correct.

2760
02:58:32,991 --> 02:58:35,128
MARISHA: So it's bright in here now.

2761
02:58:35,128 --> 02:58:38,382
LAURA: I like it. Now I can see. Oh, shit!

2762
02:58:38,382 --> 02:58:40,052
TRAVIS: As long as he's in that circle.

2763
02:58:40,052 --> 02:58:42,579
MATT: All right.

2764
02:58:42,579 --> 02:58:44,843
TALIESIN: Yeah. Just keep on him.

2765
02:58:44,843 --> 02:58:46,468
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a 30-foot radius.

2766
02:58:46,468 --> 02:58:57,956
MATT: Okay, so that ends Keyleth's turn. Back to
the top, Delilah. Delilah is now going to step out

2767
02:58:57,956 --> 02:58:59,676
of the cloud, which is now dissipating at this
point.

2768
02:58:59,676 --> 02:59:01,277
LIAM: Is she taking a step away from me?

2769
02:59:01,277 --> 02:59:02,116
MATT: Yes.

2770
02:59:02,116 --> 02:59:04,937
LIAM: I'm taking my blade with the poison on it,
and I'm going to slash at her.

2771
02:59:04,937 --> 02:59:06,732
MATT: Okay, as your reaction.

2772
02:59:06,732 --> 02:59:14,537
LIAM: That is an 18.

2773
02:59:14,537 --> 02:59:18,237
MATT: 18 would hit her.

2774
02:59:18,237 --> 02:59:25,059
LIAM: Okay, that had whatever that poison is that
I sold my soul to a hag for.

2775
02:59:25,059 --> 02:59:27,895
MATT: Yes, it did. So roll damage on that.

2776
02:59:27,895 --> 02:59:30,579
LIAM: Okay, so the regular damage is--

2777
02:59:30,579 --> 02:59:32,907
LAURA: Don't say you sold your soul to a hag.

2778
02:59:32,907 --> 02:59:40,611
LIAM: Let's deal with one problem at a time!
That's a ten for just the damage.

2779
02:59:40,611 --> 02:59:47,796
MATT: Okay. Roll an additional 6d6 poison damage.

2780
02:59:47,796 --> 02:59:49,223
SAM: 6d6?

2781
02:59:49,223 --> 02:59:50,879
LAURA: That's a Sneak Attack.

2782
02:59:50,879 --> 02:59:54,362
LIAM: No, this is poison. I'm not in a position to
sneak attack.

2783
02:59:54,362 --> 02:59:57,373
LAURA: But this is the same as a sneak attack.

2784
02:59:57,373 --> 03:00:04,558
LIAM: 12, 13, 19, 24 points of poison.

2785
03:00:04,558 --> 03:00:17,150
MATT: All right, so as you strike out, the blade
scrapes across the front of her... shit, I forgot

2786
03:00:17,232 --> 03:00:23,997
that. I'll keep that in mind for next time. The
blade streaks across the front of her body as she

2787
03:00:23,997 --> 03:00:28,157
runs past, (pained gasp) then you feel, as she
takes a few steps away, (groans) and she coughs

2788
03:00:28,157 --> 03:00:33,129
and blood spatters across the ground. She looks
over her shoulder at you. (heavy breathing)

2789
03:00:33,129 --> 03:00:35,113
LIAM: I just stare with a half-cocked smile.

2790
03:00:35,113 --> 03:00:45,687
MATT: She immediately looks back at you and says,
"You boy, stay still!" And puts her hand out

2791
03:00:45,687 --> 03:00:48,744
towards you. I need you to--

2792
03:00:48,744 --> 03:00:51,606
LIAM: Advantage, because I'm a half elf. I don't
need anything because I'm a half-elf.

2793
03:00:51,606 --> 03:00:53,908
LAURA: Is she blinded?

2794
03:00:53,908 --> 03:00:55,522
SAM: It didn't work.

2795
03:00:55,522 --> 03:01:00,478
LIAM: Is she trying to charm me or hold me?

2796
03:01:00,478 --> 03:01:01,919
MATT: Nope!

2797
03:01:01,919 --> 03:01:04,741
LIAM: Trying to disintegrate me to death?

2798
03:01:04,741 --> 03:01:16,375
MATT: She looks over to you and mutters under her
breath (foreign word). It's a phrase you've never

2799
03:01:16,375 --> 03:01:18,226
heard before, but as soon as it happens--

2800
03:01:18,226 --> 03:01:20,806
SAM: As soon as she does that-- do I see this?

2801
03:01:20,806 --> 03:01:23,654
MATT: You're just around the side of this.

2802
03:01:23,654 --> 03:01:25,138
SAM: I do not see it.

2803
03:01:25,138 --> 03:01:29,210
MATT: You glance around the side for
three-quarters cover. Roll a perception check.

2804
03:01:29,210 --> 03:01:37,655
SAM: It's a dead roll, a dead roll, it's between
two. That's terrible. Four.

2805
03:01:37,655 --> 03:01:44,152
MATT: Yeah, you do not see this happening,
unfortunately. Your mind suddenly goes blank as

2806
03:01:44,152 --> 03:01:49,269
the Power Word that's spoken suddenly stuns you in
place, unable to react.

2807
03:01:49,269 --> 03:01:50,712
LIAM: Is it a wisdom thing?

2808
03:01:50,712 --> 03:01:56,419
MATT: There's no saving throw. If you have less
than 150 hit points, you are stunned for the next

2809
03:01:56,419 --> 03:01:58,763
minute. You have to make a saving throw every turn
to resist it.

2810
03:01:58,763 --> 03:02:02,048
SAM: Okay! She's strong.

2811
03:02:02,048 --> 03:02:08,207
MATT: So you stop there. Your daggers (clanking
noise) drop to the ground as the smoke begins to

2812
03:02:08,207 --> 03:02:09,389
dissipate around you.

2813
03:02:09,389 --> 03:02:11,681
LIAM: Do the daggers then shunt back up to my
belt, though?

2814
03:02:11,681 --> 03:02:14,037
MATT: Just the cycle?

2815
03:02:14,037 --> 03:02:17,300
(laughter)

2816
03:02:17,300 --> 03:02:23,853
MATT: No, it's more of a willful return. Once you
regain your composure, you can will them back to

2817
03:02:23,853 --> 03:02:29,804
you. But currently you're drooling out of your
mouth, staring into space right there. She moves

2818
03:02:29,804 --> 03:02:39,332
off to this side and gets behind Cassandra for
protection. She's going to end her turn. She did

2819
03:02:39,332 --> 03:02:43,993
waste her action that turn to do that. Scanlan,
you're up.

2820
03:02:43,993 --> 03:02:55,385
SAM: Yeah man, she's powerful. I will step out
again, from behind. And I will try again. But this

2821
03:02:55,385 --> 03:03:02,251
time I will say, hey, you paralyzed my friend,
let's see if you like it! And I'll try to hold

2822
03:03:02,251 --> 03:03:04,868
her. Hold Person.

2823
03:03:04,868 --> 03:03:07,413
MATT: To Hold Person, okay. A DC of 19, you said
for that?

2824
03:03:07,413 --> 03:03:08,369
SAM: Yes.

2825
03:03:08,369 --> 03:03:21,103
MATT: All right. She's going to make a wisdom
saving throw. She rolls a 21. A natural 19 with a

2826
03:03:21,103 --> 03:03:29,026
plus two. I know. But as the spell shoots out from
your hands, it bounces off of her, seemingly to no

2827
03:03:29,026 --> 03:03:37,648
effect. She is inherently a very powerful caster,
and her defenses show that. Do you want to use

2828
03:03:37,648 --> 03:03:40,388
your movement to move closer, or do you want to
stay where you are?

2829
03:03:40,388 --> 03:03:42,244
SAM: That's Vax near me, right there?

2830
03:03:42,244 --> 03:03:43,206
MATT: Vax is right there, yeah.

2831
03:03:43,206 --> 03:03:47,224
SAM: I'm going to-- shit. Hide behind you?

2832
03:03:47,224 --> 03:03:48,445
LIAM: Sure, I'm bigger than you.

2833
03:03:48,445 --> 03:03:58,476
SAM: I will use my bonus action to inspire Percy,
and I'll say, (sings) Percy's got a gun.

2834
03:03:58,476 --> 03:04:07,890
Percy's got a gun. And then, yeah. Sure! I'll try
to duck behind Vax for cover.

2835
03:04:07,890 --> 03:04:09,909
LIAM: The whole world's come undone.

2836
03:04:09,909 --> 03:04:14,825
MATT: Okay, that'll get you to about there. Okay!
That'll end your turn. Vax, you're up. You spend

2837
03:04:14,825 --> 03:04:17,980
your turn staring off into space. At the end of
your turn, make a constitution saving throw.

2838
03:04:17,980 --> 03:04:21,648
LIAM: Okay. Right now? 14.

2839
03:04:21,648 --> 03:04:27,976
MATT: 14. Yeah, unfortunately you're still caught
there, staring off into the darkness. Looking out

2840
03:04:27,976 --> 03:04:29,686
over the rest of this cavern before you.

2841
03:04:29,686 --> 03:04:31,094
LIAM: It's a constitution?

2842
03:04:31,094 --> 03:04:33,232
MATT: It's a constitution, yeah.

2843
03:04:33,232 --> 03:04:34,318
LIAM: Okay.

2844
03:04:34,318 --> 03:04:36,224
MATT: All right. Grog, you're up.

2845
03:04:36,224 --> 03:04:45,624
TRAVIS: I'd like to go into a frenzied rage, and I
would like to see and swing away at Lord

2846
03:04:45,624 --> 03:04:46,885
Briarwood.

2847
03:04:46,885 --> 03:04:47,965
TALIESIN: Yeah!

2848
03:04:47,965 --> 03:04:55,866
MATT: All righty. Actually, real fast, before that
happens, at the end of Vax's turn, Sylas is going

2849
03:04:55,866 --> 03:05:06,781
to use one of his secondary legendary actions to
move without his movement, again back over to this

2850
03:05:06,781 --> 03:05:11,381
side of the pillar. He darts around.

2851
03:05:11,381 --> 03:05:15,129
TRAVIS: Well, he left. Cassandra's there.

2852
03:05:15,129 --> 03:05:17,882
MATT: You can still move during your turn if you
want to. But if you want to go after

2853
03:05:17,882 --> 03:05:19,013
Cassandra you can.

2854
03:05:19,013 --> 03:05:22,373
TRAVIS: She would get an attack of opportunity,
wouldn't she? I'm going to turn her into

2855
03:05:22,373 --> 03:05:23,437
applesauce.

2856
03:05:23,437 --> 03:05:24,394
MATT: Okay.

2857
03:05:24,394 --> 03:05:25,439
(laughter)

2858
03:05:25,439 --> 03:05:31,975
TRAVIS: Sorry. Not really sorry. 21.

2859
03:05:31,975 --> 03:05:33,191
MATT: That hits.

2860
03:05:33,191 --> 03:05:36,182
TRAVIS: Same thing, 21.

2861
03:05:36,182 --> 03:05:37,299
MATT: That hits.

2862
03:05:37,299 --> 03:05:38,942
TRAVIS: And a 14.

2863
03:05:38,942 --> 03:05:40,360
MATT: 14 misses.

2864
03:05:40,360 --> 03:05:48,285
TRAVIS: 17. 24.

2865
03:05:48,285 --> 03:05:51,111
MATT: 24 damage, on the first one?

2866
03:05:51,111 --> 03:05:57,756
TRAVIS: 24 for the first one. And 22 for the
second one.

2867
03:05:57,756 --> 03:05:58,971
MATT: Okay.

2868
03:05:58,971 --> 03:06:02,041
TRAVIS: But she doesn't take any holy damage off
of the oil on the thing, right?

2869
03:06:02,041 --> 03:06:06,039
MATT: No, but as the hammer slams into her armor
she gets slammed against the pillar from the

2870
03:06:06,039 --> 03:06:10,626
impact of it. She tries to right herself and push
off against the wall. You use the momentum to spin

2871
03:06:10,626 --> 03:06:13,550
around and hit her in the other side, slamming her
up against the wall on the side of the structure

2872
03:06:13,550 --> 03:06:17,523
and you hear her breath escape and she goes
(gasping breath). Is having to catch her breath.

2873
03:06:17,523 --> 03:06:20,480
And she looks at you with this look of "That
really hurt!"

2874
03:06:20,480 --> 03:06:24,663
TRAVIS: Yeah, I've been known to take a lady's
breath away! (laughs)

2875
03:06:24,663 --> 03:06:30,040
MATT: You want to move, or will you stay where you
are?

2876
03:06:30,040 --> 03:06:31,382
TRAVIS: I'll stay where I am.

2877
03:06:31,382 --> 03:06:48,604
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn. It is now Sylas's
turn. Sylas, looking over this way. He does not

2878
03:06:48,604 --> 03:06:52,134
regenerate any hit points, because of the
multitude of holy and radiant damage he took last

2879
03:06:52,134 --> 03:07:00,959
turn, his regeneration is stunted at the moment.
He has to keep away from Keyleth. He is going to,

2880
03:07:00,959 --> 03:07:25,585
instead... he's in a rough place. Then he's going
to move one, two, three, four, five, six... Nope!

2881
03:07:25,585 --> 03:07:34,912
Actually, he's going to-- you know what? He's
going to take it. He's going to go ahead and

2882
03:07:34,912 --> 03:07:42,141
boldly step into the sunlight, which puts him at
disadvantage with his attacks. But he is going to

2883
03:07:42,141 --> 03:07:45,843
unload on you, Percy, who he marked previously.

2884
03:07:45,843 --> 03:07:48,930
TRAVIS: He marked you?

2885
03:07:48,930 --> 03:07:57,104
MATT: You marked his wife. So that is a 20?

2886
03:07:57,104 --> 03:07:58,834
TALIESIN: Yeah, that hits.

2887
03:07:58,834 --> 03:08:04,084
MATT: Second strike is-- two natural 20s in a row.
With disadvantage, he still crits.

2888
03:08:04,084 --> 03:08:05,643
TRAVIS: Two natural 20s in a row!?

2889
03:08:05,643 --> 03:08:07,217
MATT: Yeah, so with disadvantage he still crit.

2890
03:08:07,217 --> 03:08:08,703
LIAM: Fucking bastard.

2891
03:08:08,703 --> 03:08:10,685
MATT: The last one is a 23.

2892
03:08:10,685 --> 03:08:12,650
MARISHA: With disadvantage he still crit, how?

2893
03:08:12,650 --> 03:08:14,217
MATT: I rolled two natural 20s in a row.

2894
03:08:14,217 --> 03:08:15,965
MARISHA: Oh, you-- yeah, right.

2895
03:08:15,965 --> 03:08:21,268
TALIESIN: I'm so excited about this new character
I'm working on.

2896
03:08:21,268 --> 03:08:23,655
MATT: 14 points of slashing damage from the first
strike.

2897
03:08:23,655 --> 03:08:25,671
TALIESIN: Jesus. Okay, 14.

2898
03:08:25,671 --> 03:08:29,719
MATT: The crit is 27 points of slashing damage.

2899
03:08:29,719 --> 03:08:31,013
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

2900
03:08:31,013 --> 03:08:41,900
MATT: And the last one is 13 points of slashing
damage. Roll three constitution saves.

2901
03:08:41,900 --> 03:08:46,819
TALIESIN: I'll tally up the damage in a minute.

2902
03:08:46,819 --> 03:08:55,224
MATT: Actually, ignore the last attack. Because
technically, Lady Briarwood would have lost her

2903
03:08:55,224 --> 03:08:58,309
concentration on the Haste spell she had on him
from the damage she took earlier.

2904
03:08:58,309 --> 03:09:00,488
TALIESIN: Ignore the last attack?

2905
03:09:00,488 --> 03:09:01,982
MATT: Ignore the last attack.

2906
03:09:01,982 --> 03:09:04,945
TALIESIN: So that would have been-- my first save
is 13?

2907
03:09:04,945 --> 03:09:09,249
MATT: 13? All right, that does succeed.

2908
03:09:09,249 --> 03:09:16,077
TALIESIN: And that's 22, yeah.

2909
03:09:16,077 --> 03:09:17,897
MATT: So you resist the effect of the two
strikes.

2910
03:09:17,897 --> 03:09:19,862
TALIESIN: I'm going to figure out how much damage
I just took.

2911
03:09:19,862 --> 03:09:30,953
MARISHA: 41.

2912
03:09:30,953 --> 03:09:37,080
TALIESIN: No, it's 27, 37-- oh, 41, you're right.
I'm alive.

2913
03:09:37,080 --> 03:09:44,154
MATT: Okay. So that ends Taliesin's turn. Pike,
you're up.

2914
03:09:44,154 --> 03:09:45,583
ALL: Pike!

2915
03:09:45,583 --> 03:09:48,180
ASHLEY: What are you at, Percy?

2916
03:09:48,180 --> 03:09:54,005
TALIESIN: I'm at the other side of the world, but
you could probably get close enough to do

2917
03:09:54,005 --> 03:09:56,040
something if you ran and not get in anybody's
way.

2918
03:09:56,040 --> 03:09:57,692
SAM: He's hurting, but he's not dead.

2919
03:09:57,692 --> 03:10:01,009
LAURA: But he's pretty close to dying.

2920
03:10:01,009 --> 03:10:03,479
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to Sprinter's Boot over to
him.

2921
03:10:03,479 --> 03:10:05,912
MATT: How many times can you use Sprinter's
Boots?

2922
03:10:05,912 --> 03:10:07,186
ASHLEY: Say again?

2923
03:10:07,186 --> 03:10:10,087
MATT: Sprinter's Boots. How many times can you use
it? Does it say on the item?

2924
03:10:10,087 --> 03:10:12,286
How long does it last?

2925
03:10:12,286 --> 03:10:16,005
ASHLEY: I can use it twice. I haven't used it
yet.

2926
03:10:16,005 --> 03:10:23,209
MATT: Okay. You're now within 35 feet of him.

2927
03:10:23,209 --> 03:10:27,666
ASHLEY: Okay. Is that within range?

2928
03:10:27,666 --> 03:10:29,258
MATT: For Healing Word it is, yes.

2929
03:10:29,258 --> 03:10:31,588
ASHLEY: All right, so I'll Healing Word.

2930
03:10:31,588 --> 03:10:32,858
MATT: All right.

2931
03:10:32,858 --> 03:10:34,402
LAURA: What about-- oh, sorry.

2932
03:10:34,402 --> 03:10:38,546
TALIESIN: We can inform her of the map though,
since she doesn't have a very--

2933
03:10:38,546 --> 03:10:49,323
ASHLEY: Okay. So I can't Cure Wounds because I'm
not close to him, right?

2934
03:10:49,323 --> 03:10:51,325
MATT: Exactly. You have to be right next to them.

2935
03:10:51,325 --> 03:11:00,876
ASHLEY: Okay. So let's do that. Oh my word, I'm
shaking so bad. Okay, here we go.

2936
03:11:00,876 --> 03:11:03,997
MATT: So go ahead and roll for the heal on that.

2937
03:11:03,997 --> 03:11:16,939
ASHLEY: Just rolling.

2938
03:11:16,939 --> 03:11:23,150
LIAM: You're all the way in Vasselheim!

2939
03:11:23,150 --> 03:11:25,477
MARISHA: You're so far away.

2940
03:11:25,477 --> 03:11:30,402
ASHLEY: 26.

2941
03:11:30,402 --> 03:11:32,874
MATT: 26, all right. What level was that?

2942
03:11:32,874 --> 03:11:37,876
ASHLEY: Five. Sorry, I did five.

2943
03:11:37,876 --> 03:11:44,525
MATT: 5th-level Healing Word. All righty. That's a
bonus action. You can still do up to a 2nd-level

2944
03:11:44,525 --> 03:11:46,436
spell as your action if you'd like.

2945
03:11:46,436 --> 03:11:47,800
SAM: Do it!

2946
03:11:47,800 --> 03:11:51,364
ASHLEY: Shoot. Okay, I'm not close to him.

2947
03:11:51,364 --> 03:11:55,663
LIAM: Can you unleash some holy fire on any
fucks?

2948
03:11:55,663 --> 03:11:59,211
LAURA: Yeah! Like a radiant blast or something?

2949
03:11:59,211 --> 03:12:04,481
ASHLEY: Can I take my Mace of Disruption and slam
it on the ground?

2950
03:12:04,481 --> 03:12:06,720
MATT: If you want to!

2951
03:12:06,720 --> 03:12:11,404
ASHLEY: Oh god. Wait, how close am I to Sylas?

2952
03:12:11,404 --> 03:12:14,719
SAM: You're 15 feet from Sylas and 15 feet from
Lady Briarwood.

2953
03:12:14,719 --> 03:12:18,114
MATT: Well, 30 feet from Sylas and 15 feet from
Lady Briarwood.

2954
03:12:18,114 --> 03:12:22,652
ASHLEY: Okay. You know what? Let's just do a
Sacred Flame.

2955
03:12:22,652 --> 03:12:24,804
MATT: Sacred Flame? Okay.

2956
03:12:24,804 --> 03:12:26,680
TALIESIN: She's 20 feet from Sylas.

2957
03:12:26,680 --> 03:12:27,892
MARISHA: Yeah.

2958
03:12:27,892 --> 03:12:31,727
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.

2959
03:12:31,727 --> 03:12:34,087
ASHLEY: Sorry, guys. This totally sucks.

2960
03:12:34,175 --> 03:12:36,946
LIAM: It's all right, it's all right. You know,
the astral plane is tricky.

2961
03:12:37,040 --> 03:12:43,857
MATT: So dexterity saving throw. He does not make
his dexterity saving throw. 1d8 radiant damage.

2962
03:12:43,925 --> 03:12:49,328
ASHLEY: Okay. And then can I use Scanlan's
extra?

2963
03:12:49,413 --> 03:12:51,179
LAURA and SAM: That's only on the attack.

2964
03:12:51,179 --> 03:12:53,270
MATT: Not for damage. So just roll 1d8.

2965
03:12:53,270 --> 03:12:54,508
ASHLEY: Eight!

2966
03:12:54,508 --> 03:13:04,720
MATT: All righty. Vex, you're up. You've got
Trinket right here on the steps.

2967
03:13:04,720 --> 03:13:16,996
LAURA: I know. I am going to cast-- nobody's in a
clump anymore! They keep moving around!

2968
03:13:16,996 --> 03:13:19,174
LIAM: That freaking wizard woman, man!

2969
03:13:19,174 --> 03:13:24,198
LAURA: I'm going to attack Lady Briarwood with
just two attacks.

2970
03:13:24,198 --> 03:13:27,214
LIAM: That's good! Chip her down!

2971
03:13:27,214 --> 03:13:29,020
MATT: And you keep Trinket here by the steps?

2972
03:13:29,020 --> 03:13:34,916
LAURA: Trinket's going to run next to Vax.

2973
03:13:34,916 --> 03:13:40,895
MATT: Okay. All right. Yeah, you're within range.
You're fine.

2974
03:13:40,895 --> 03:13:44,825
LAURA: Okay. And then I'm going to shoot her a
couple times.

2975
03:13:44,825 --> 03:13:46,157
MATT: All right, go for it.

2976
03:13:46,157 --> 03:13:50,377
LAURA. Okay. 23 for the first?

2977
03:13:50,377 --> 03:13:55,668
MATT: Okay, because I forgot to do this on the
last attack, we're initiating now. Her image is

2978
03:13:55,668 --> 03:13:58,865
shifting based on her location, so you have a
disadvantage on the attack roll.

2979
03:13:58,865 --> 03:14:02,245
LAURA: Natural 20.

2980
03:14:02,245 --> 03:14:04,255
LIAM: But the last one was good, so 23.

2981
03:14:04,255 --> 03:14:06,370
LAURA: Yeah, the first one was a 23.

2982
03:14:06,370 --> 03:14:07,466
MATT: 23 hits.

2983
03:14:07,466 --> 03:14:08,985
LAURA: Natural 20 again!

2984
03:14:08,985 --> 03:14:16,351
MATT: Okay. You do not have disadvantage. After
you hit her, the effect vanishes. That is a

2985
03:14:16,351 --> 03:14:17,955
natural 20 against her. Go ahead and roll damage.

2986
03:14:17,955 --> 03:14:30,236
LAURA: 17 for the first one. And then what do I
do, just double the second?

2987
03:14:30,236 --> 03:14:35,565
MATT: Roll damage, then double the dice roll.

2988
03:14:35,622 --> 03:14:37,698
LAURA: 19 for the second.

2989
03:14:37,698 --> 03:14:43,345
MATT: Okay, cool. So (arrow whizzing) the arrows
both strike into her chest (pained grunt). The

2990
03:14:43,345 --> 03:14:49,326
shimmering to her form vanishes for a second. You
can see her cloak falls limp momentarily. She

2991
03:14:49,326 --> 03:14:51,291
looks off into the shadow and sees you floating
above.

2992
03:14:51,291 --> 03:14:52,368
LAURA: Hide!

2993
03:14:52,368 --> 03:14:58,733
MATT: You attempt to hide? Right now you're just
pulling in and out of the shadow? You shoot and

2994
03:14:58,733 --> 03:15:01,344
you're going to have to try and back up even
further. Probably out of your attack range to

2995
03:15:01,344 --> 03:15:02,264
disappear again.

2996
03:15:02,264 --> 03:15:06,010
LAURA: Instead of backing up, can I go sideways?

2997
03:15:06,010 --> 03:15:11,085
MATT: You can try to get over this way, but you
don't have enough movement to get there. You'd get

2998
03:15:11,085 --> 03:15:14,289
about there and still be out in the open this
turn.

2999
03:15:14,289 --> 03:15:15,166
LAURA: Okay.

3000
03:15:15,166 --> 03:15:18,257
MATT: It's one of those things where you're just
out in the sky right now. Initially, when there

3001
03:15:18,257 --> 03:15:21,574
was the overhang and they were covered in the
smoke, it was easier for you to hide in the

3002
03:15:21,574 --> 03:15:24,596
shadow. But now you've made yourself known, you
have nothing hiding behind you and her.

3003
03:15:24,596 --> 03:15:28,372
LAURA: Can I go below where the steps are to hide?
Behind the wall?

3004
03:15:28,372 --> 03:15:33,556
MATT: You would be able to get right about level
this turn, and next turn you could go beneath. So

3005
03:15:33,556 --> 03:15:35,177
you would not be able to hide as an additional
this turn.

3006
03:15:35,177 --> 03:15:45,272
LAURA: Okay, then I want to stay high. And I'm
going to use my bonus action to cast Hunter's Mark

3007
03:15:45,272 --> 03:15:46,370
on her.

3008
03:15:46,370 --> 03:15:47,721
MATT: Okay!

3009
03:15:47,721 --> 03:15:52,132
LAURA: Oh man! I should have done that at the
beginning, but I thought I was going to hide

3010
03:15:52,132 --> 03:15:54,067
again. What a waste.

3011
03:15:54,067 --> 03:16:00,936
MATT: All righty. So that ends your turn. Percy,
you're up. Actually, at the end of your turn,

3012
03:16:00,936 --> 03:16:04,922
Sylas is going to use another one of his legendary
actions to make another attack on Percy.

3013
03:16:04,922 --> 03:16:06,700
TALIESIN: God-fucking-damn it.

3014
03:16:06,700 --> 03:16:08,506
MARISHA: How many of those fuckers does he have?

3015
03:16:08,506 --> 03:16:09,996
MATT: Oh, he gets three every turn.

3016
03:16:09,996 --> 03:16:11,366
MARISHA: He gets three every turn?!

3017
03:16:11,366 --> 03:16:12,413
TRAVIS: Every round.

3018
03:16:12,413 --> 03:16:20,635
MATT: After every round, I mean. That will be-- he
has disadvantage, so he doesn't crit. (laughs) But

3019
03:16:20,635 --> 03:16:22,614
that is still a 30.

3020
03:16:22,614 --> 03:16:24,964
SAM and TALIESIN: 30?!

3021
03:16:24,964 --> 03:16:30,375
MATT: He rolled a 19 and a 20. My rolls for him
have been pretty good these past few rounds. So

3022
03:16:30,375 --> 03:16:34,083
that's another 13 points of slashing damage
against you.

3023
03:16:34,083 --> 03:16:35,150
TALIESIN: All right!

3024
03:16:35,150 --> 03:16:36,333
MATT: And make a constitution saving throw.

3025
03:16:36,333 --> 03:16:37,619
TALIESIN: And make another constitution saving
throw.

3026
03:16:37,619 --> 03:16:39,078
MARISHA: How are you?

3027
03:16:39,078 --> 03:16:42,107
SAM: Pike helped.

3028
03:16:42,107 --> 03:16:44,511
TALIESIN: 13 points of damage?

3029
03:16:44,511 --> 03:16:46,532
MATT: Yep! And then roll another constitution--

3030
03:16:46,532 --> 03:16:49,801
TALIESIN: Saving throw. That's 18.

3031
03:16:49,801 --> 03:16:52,877
MATT: 18? You're fine. Okay. Continue with your
turn?

3032
03:16:52,877 --> 03:17:02,465
TALIESIN: Still, he keeps getting in my shit.
There's just no getting the fuck away from him, is

3033
03:17:02,465 --> 03:17:09,973
there? That's fine. Well he's in the 30-foot
radius of light right now, so do my attacks have

3034
03:17:09,973 --> 03:17:11,061
an advantage against him?

3035
03:17:11,061 --> 03:17:13,337
MATT: No, he just has disadvantage on attack rolls
and ability checks.

3036
03:17:13,337 --> 03:17:18,945
TALIESIN: Okay. There's just no backing away from
him right now. I'm going to have to wait for him

3037
03:17:18,945 --> 03:17:21,135
to try and break off from me through Grog.

3038
03:17:21,135 --> 03:17:25,016
MARISHA: He wants you. He wants your bod.

3039
03:17:25,016 --> 03:17:31,002
TALIESIN: Yeah, I get it. So, everyone wants my
bod. I'm going to take three slashes with the

3040
03:17:31,002 --> 03:17:33,550
sword again since I'm too close to use the
guns.

3041
03:17:33,550 --> 03:17:35,351
MATT: Okay.

3042
03:17:35,441 --> 03:17:38,016
TALIESIN: 25?

3043
03:17:38,016 --> 03:17:40,394
MATT: 25? Hits.

3044
03:17:40,394 --> 03:17:42,891
TALIESIN: 14?

3045
03:17:42,891 --> 03:17:44,189
MATT: 14 misses.

3046
03:17:44,189 --> 03:17:45,667
SAM: You got inspiration!

3047
03:17:45,667 --> 03:17:48,954
TALIESIN: I know, but I don't want to waste it on
this. And 13.

3048
03:17:48,954 --> 03:17:53,743
MATT: Only one strike hits. Twice you pierce, he's
just too fast, on one side strikes off his armor

3049
03:17:53,827 --> 03:17:59,448
harmlessly. One strike does manage to get over the
collarbone of his armor and pierce into his chest.

3050
03:17:59,448 --> 03:18:01,754
He goes (groan) from the pain. Go ahead and roll
damage.

3051
03:18:01,754 --> 03:18:05,179
MARISHA: He's got more where that came from
though. He's a very inspiring person.

3052
03:18:05,179 --> 03:18:09,814
TALIESIN: I want you to inspire other people. 12.

3053
03:18:09,814 --> 03:18:15,622
MATT: 12 damage, all right. That ends your go.

3054
03:18:15,622 --> 03:18:18,291
TALIESIN: Save it for a shot.

3055
03:18:18,291 --> 03:18:33,736
MATT: Cassandra is going to-- actually, she's
going to move alongside, still staying next to

3056
03:18:33,736 --> 03:18:37,515
Grog. And moves up with her blade out towards
you.

3057
03:18:37,515 --> 03:18:38,784
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

3058
03:18:38,784 --> 03:18:54,639
MATT: Looks over at Sylas, and Sylas is nudging
with his eyes. And she looks at you. And she drops

3059
03:18:54,639 --> 03:19:00,364
her blade for a second. And just stands there for
a second, looking at the scenario. And her turn is

3060
03:19:00,364 --> 03:19:01,826
spent there.

3061
03:19:01,826 --> 03:19:03,299
TALIESIN: Yeah!

3062
03:19:03,299 --> 03:19:05,230
LAURA: She's trying! She's trying to fight it!

3063
03:19:05,230 --> 03:19:08,866
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

3064
03:19:08,866 --> 03:19:11,278
MARISHA: Knock her out. Me?

3065
03:19:11,278 --> 03:19:12,348
MATT: Yeah.

3066
03:19:12,348 --> 03:19:14,536
MARISHA: Okay. How close am I to Sylas?

3067
03:19:14,536 --> 03:19:17,847
MATT: You are currently 25 feet from him.

3068
03:19:17,847 --> 03:19:33,343
MARISHA: Okay. Here's what I'm going to do. Seeing
that Sylas is distracted, I'm going to run up, and

3069
03:19:33,343 --> 03:19:39,400
I'm going to put my hands on his back, and I'm
going to cast Sunbeam through him and try and hit

3070
03:19:39,400 --> 03:19:41,158
Lady Briarwood as well.

3071
03:19:41,158 --> 03:19:44,968
MATT: There is a pillar between the two of them,
so it won't go through the pillar, unfortunately.

3072
03:19:44,968 --> 03:19:51,787
MARISHA: Then I just hug him, and I'm like,
(sings) Let the sunshine in!

3073
03:19:51,787 --> 03:19:58,377
MARISHA, LAURA, TRAVIS, and SAM: (sing) Let the
sunshine in. The sun shine in!

3074
03:19:58,377 --> 03:20:02,612
TALIESIN: Really? You're going to kill him with
hugs. This is the most Keyleth

3075
03:20:02,612 --> 03:20:03,781
thing I've ever heard.

3076
03:20:03,781 --> 03:20:06,807
MARISHA: I'm trying to do a concentrated Sunbeam.
I don't know if it's going to help.

3077
03:20:06,807 --> 03:20:09,832
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

3078
03:20:09,832 --> 03:20:13,139
MARISHA: Balls, fuck, shit. Ten.

3079
03:20:13,139 --> 03:20:16,629
MATT: He's going to use his second legendary
action to automatically succeed the saving throw.

3080
03:20:16,629 --> 03:20:21,074
MARISHA: 25, total.

3081
03:20:21,074 --> 03:20:25,486
MATT: 25, okay. So that's 13. This time, as you
blast into his back you see the light burns

3082
03:20:25,486 --> 03:20:28,929
through parts of his shoulder and chunks of his
flesh are actually blown through his armor. His

3083
03:20:28,929 --> 03:20:33,320
armor streaks open for a second. He's like,
(pained grunt). Smoke is now sizzling up around

3084
03:20:33,320 --> 03:20:35,965
him and he looks over his shoulder with this angry
red gaze--

3085
03:20:35,965 --> 03:20:39,591
MARISHA: And I take my nails and dig them in a
little bit.

3086
03:20:39,591 --> 03:20:47,177
MATT: At the end of your turn, he uses another
legendary action to then try and shove you off and

3087
03:20:47,177 --> 03:20:53,051
arc upwards with his sword across the front of
your chest. Even with disadvantage, that's still

3088
03:20:53,051 --> 03:20:54,223
19.

3089
03:20:54,223 --> 03:20:55,322
MARISHA: Hits.

3090
03:20:55,322 --> 03:21:02,718
MATT: All right. You take 16 points of slashing
damage, then make a constitution saving throw.

3091
03:21:02,718 --> 03:21:19,467
MARISHA: Oh, wait. Hang on. Okay, has to be over
12, right? A saving throw? 17.

3092
03:21:19,565 --> 03:21:26,919
MATT: 17? Okay, you resist the effect of the
sword. That ends your turn. Back at the top. Sylas

3093
03:21:26,919 --> 03:21:35,655
right now is like (panting). He's looking pretty
rough. Lady Delilah runs up around the side and

3094
03:21:35,655 --> 03:21:42,267
goes, "My love, we're not ready, but the
timetable's been pushed. We have no choice." And

3095
03:21:42,267 --> 03:21:44,302
she wraps her arms around them and they both--

3096
03:21:44,302 --> 03:21:48,584
SAM: I cast Counterspell as a reaction.

3097
03:21:48,584 --> 03:21:50,710
MATT: What's the range on Counterspell?

3098
03:21:50,710 --> 03:21:52,559
LIAM: Not again!

3099
03:21:52,559 --> 03:21:54,676
SAM: 60 feet. Am I close enough?

3100
03:21:54,676 --> 03:21:56,836
TRAVIS: I don't think you are.

3101
03:21:56,836 --> 03:22:04,146
MATT: 60 feet. (counting)

3102
03:22:04,146 --> 03:22:06,392
She is in range! All right.

3103
03:22:06,392 --> 03:22:09,111
(cheering)

3104
03:22:09,111 --> 03:22:16,303
SAM: I say-- shit. Do I know what she's casting?
Am I familiar with it?

3105
03:22:16,303 --> 03:22:19,710
MATT: You're familiar with the actions about it,
so you'd have an idea, yes.

3106
03:22:19,710 --> 03:22:21,464
SAM: Do I know what level it is?

3107
03:22:21,464 --> 03:22:22,990
MATT: You don't know what level, no.

3108
03:22:22,990 --> 03:22:31,621
SAM: Okay, so I'll say, (sings) Huh! That's the
sound of the gnome, fucking with your spell!

3109
03:22:31,621 --> 03:22:36,422
Yeah. And I'll cast it at level four.

3110
03:22:36,422 --> 03:22:43,736
MATT: At level four? All right. So I need you to
roll--

3111
03:22:43,736 --> 03:22:45,432
SAM: Fuck, so it's higher than that.

3112
03:22:45,432 --> 03:22:46,958
MATT: She's casting it at 5th-level.

3113
03:22:46,958 --> 03:22:49,241
SAM: What do I roll?

3114
03:22:49,241 --> 03:22:55,609
MATT: For this, roll a d20 and add your charisma
bonus to it. So plus five.

3115
03:22:55,609 --> 03:22:56,992
SAM: I'm a charismatic guy.

3116
03:22:56,992 --> 03:22:58,116
MATT: You are.

3117
03:22:58,116 --> 03:23:00,066
SAM: 23.

3118
03:23:00,066 --> 03:23:05,305
MATT: And with that, she grasps him. The Door
begins to open, and then flickers.

3119
03:23:05,305 --> 03:23:07,453
(cheering)

3120
03:23:07,453 --> 03:23:09,621
SAM: Stay.

3121
03:23:09,621 --> 03:23:27,413
MATT: She whips around, (growls). Okay. Yeah,
that's going to end her turn. All right. With

3122
03:23:27,413 --> 03:23:31,107
this, that ends her turn. Scanlan, you're up.

3123
03:23:31,107 --> 03:23:39,017
SAM: Grog? I hold my turn.

3124
03:23:39,017 --> 03:23:41,139
MATT: Okay.

3125
03:23:41,139 --> 03:23:51,642
SAM: I'm sorry, I hold my action and my movement.
And instead I will inspire Grog with a little

3126
03:23:51,642 --> 03:23:57,770
harmonica ditty. (harmonica)

3127
03:23:57,770 --> 03:23:59,147
TALIESIN: Jaunty!

3128
03:23:59,147 --> 03:24:01,160
MATT: Okay. All righty.

3129
03:24:01,160 --> 03:24:03,892
SAM: Oh, is it his turn now, next?

3130
03:24:03,892 --> 03:24:07,215
MATT: No, it is not. You hold the rest of your
turn?

3131
03:24:07,215 --> 03:24:08,121
SAM: I hold.

3132
03:24:08,121 --> 03:24:12,731
MATT: All right. Vax. Still left there, staring
into space.

3133
03:24:12,731 --> 03:24:14,362
LIAM: Constitution save at this point?

3134
03:24:14,362 --> 03:24:16,417
MATT: This would be a constitution saving throw
again, yeah.

3135
03:24:16,417 --> 03:24:18,836
LAURA: If only Scanlan had inspired you.

3136
03:24:18,836 --> 03:24:20,820
LIAM: If only. No.

3137
03:24:20,820 --> 03:24:25,614
MATT: Still left there. Useless. Staring in the
distance.

3138
03:24:25,614 --> 03:24:28,653
LIAM: Thinking of IKEA instructions.

3139
03:24:28,653 --> 03:24:33,346
LAURA: Well, I thought Trinket would be able to
help you, but you're not doing anything.

3140
03:24:33,346 --> 03:24:35,032
MATT: Grog, now you're up.

3141
03:24:35,032 --> 03:24:37,057
TRAVIS: So for the Boots of Levitation--

3142
03:24:37,057 --> 03:24:38,406
MATT: Actually, before that happens.

3143
03:24:38,406 --> 03:24:39,740
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

3144
03:24:39,740 --> 03:24:44,485
MATT: At the end of your turn, he's going to use
his third legendary action in this round to,

3145
03:24:44,485 --> 03:24:48,365
without any attacks of opportunity, move.

3146
03:24:48,365 --> 03:24:56,845
TRAVIS: Is that Lord Briarwood?

3147
03:24:56,845 --> 03:25:04,275
MATT: Yes. He pulls away, still trying to get out
of the range of the sunlight.

3148
03:25:04,275 --> 03:25:12,587
TRAVIS: Okay. The Boots of Levitation. It says it
requires an action to levitate?

3149
03:25:12,587 --> 03:25:13,578
MATT: Correct.

3150
03:25:13,578 --> 03:25:16,826
TRAVIS: Could I do three attacks? Or just two, and
then have the action left over?

3151
03:25:16,826 --> 03:25:19,930
MATT: You could action and then you'd have your
one bonus strike as a frenzied rage.

3152
03:25:19,930 --> 03:25:25,857
SAM: Can you put on the boots as a bonus action?

3153
03:25:25,857 --> 03:25:28,178
TRAVIS: I'm already wearing them.

3154
03:25:28,178 --> 03:25:29,798
LAURA: Just set it up.

3155
03:25:29,798 --> 03:25:32,944
TRAVIS: Set it up?

3156
03:25:32,944 --> 03:25:35,078
LAURA: You could do it on this move. Then on the
next move--

3157
03:25:35,078 --> 03:25:36,386
SAM: It's too long.

3158
03:25:36,386 --> 03:25:40,628
TRAVIS: Yeah, fuck it. I'll take all three strikes
at Lady Briarwood.

3159
03:25:40,628 --> 03:25:47,074
MATT: Okay! So you move in, to there. Go ahead and
make your attacks.

3160
03:25:47,074 --> 03:25:49,698
TRAVIS: That's good. 25?

3161
03:25:49,698 --> 03:25:53,949
MATT: You have disadvantage on these strikes, as
her cloak has now kicked back in.

3162
03:25:53,949 --> 03:25:56,196
TRAVIS: 17?

3163
03:25:56,196 --> 03:26:02,556
MATT: 17 misses. First blow passes through her
form harmlessly.

3164
03:26:02,556 --> 03:26:04,200
SAM: You're inspired!

3165
03:26:04,200 --> 03:26:06,892
TRAVIS: I'll use that inspiration on that one. No,
not on that one.

3166
03:26:06,892 --> 03:26:10,110
MATT: So the first one missed, the second one
missed?

3167
03:26:10,110 --> 03:26:13,368
TRAVIS: The first and the second one missed.

3168
03:26:13,368 --> 03:26:16,137
MATT: The first strike, with disadvantage.

3169
03:26:16,137 --> 03:26:25,210
TRAVIS: Jesus Christ. 20.

3170
03:26:25,210 --> 03:26:33,560
MATT: 20 hits. As this one actually finds purchase
on her torso, the shimmering effect vanishes once

3171
03:26:33,560 --> 03:26:35,704
again, the cloak falling limp to her side.

3172
03:26:35,704 --> 03:26:38,127
TRAVIS: 19.

3173
03:26:38,127 --> 03:26:45,671
MATT: 19. Okay. The hammer slams into the front of
her chest, and she goes, (panting).

3174
03:26:45,671 --> 03:26:50,526
She's starting to get almost feral in her
frustration.

3175
03:26:50,526 --> 03:26:53,689
MARISHA: Feral?

3176
03:26:53,689 --> 03:26:56,284
MATT: (growls) She's angry.

3177
03:26:56,284 --> 03:26:57,313
MARISHA: Okay.

3178
03:26:57,313 --> 03:27:07,534
SAM: I will take my move now. And I will (singing)
Bigby's Hand! (speaking) And I will raise up the

3179
03:27:07,534 --> 03:27:11,559
hand somewhere between Sylas and Lady.

3180
03:27:11,559 --> 03:27:19,009
(cheering)

3181
03:27:19,009 --> 03:27:21,250
MARISHA: Look at that sexy hand!

3182
03:27:21,250 --> 03:27:23,325
SAM: Mister is injured, right?

3183
03:27:23,325 --> 03:27:25,246
LIAM: He's looking rough!

3184
03:27:25,246 --> 03:27:29,462
SAM: And she is not flickering anymore, so I can
get a good hit on her, as well?

3185
03:27:29,462 --> 03:27:32,394
MATT: Correct. Yeah, the disadvantage on attacks
against her has faded.

3186
03:27:32,394 --> 03:27:37,460
SAM: I will go on her. I don't like her, so I'll
punch her in the face.

3187
03:27:37,460 --> 03:27:43,842
MATT: Okay! Goes forward. Go ahead and roll for
your spell attack against her.

3188
03:27:43,842 --> 03:27:47,391
SAM: Oh, okay. Is this through the cone?

3189
03:27:47,391 --> 03:27:52,399
MATT: There isn't a cone aspect to it.

3190
03:27:52,399 --> 03:27:54,980
SAM: Oh, so do I just roll to hit?

3191
03:27:54,980 --> 03:27:59,208
MATT: Here you go, I'll pull it up right here. All
right, this is the clenched fist? You make a melee

3192
03:27:59,208 --> 03:28:01,270
spell attack. Roll a d20 and add your spell attack
bonus.

3193
03:28:01,270 --> 03:28:07,329
SAM: Okay. (giggles) Spell attack. 16?

3194
03:28:07,329 --> 03:28:12,395
MATT: 16. As the fist (whoosh) towards her, she
ducks and it slams into the pillar, cracking the

3195
03:28:12,395 --> 03:28:14,205
stone slightly.

3196
03:28:14,205 --> 03:28:20,654
SAM: Shit. How far away am I from both of them?

3197
03:28:20,654 --> 03:28:28,206
MATT: From both of them? You are about 45 feet
from Sylas and about 65 feet from her.

3198
03:28:28,206 --> 03:28:32,939
SAM: I get ten feet closer to her.

3199
03:28:32,939 --> 03:28:35,264
LAURA: (quietly) Can you inspire Vax?

3200
03:28:35,264 --> 03:28:39,680
SAM: This is the rest of my turn. I already used
it to inspire Grog.

3201
03:28:39,680 --> 03:28:49,007
MATT: All right, so that's the end of Grog's turn?
All right. It is now Sylas's turn. Sylas is going

3202
03:28:49,007 --> 03:28:56,126
to step off to the side here, stepping off to the
stairs to get out of the range of the sunlight.

3203
03:28:56,126 --> 03:29:01,573
Just outside of the radius of it. And, glancing
over at you, after you just unleashed that swing

3204
03:29:01,573 --> 03:29:08,807
of attacks towards his wife, he goes, "You. Help
us." Make a wisdom saving throw with advantage.

3205
03:29:08,807 --> 03:29:10,140
TRAVIS: With advantage?

3206
03:29:10,140 --> 03:29:11,448
MATT: With advantage.

3207
03:29:11,448 --> 03:29:13,132
LIAM: Roll. High.

3208
03:29:13,132 --> 03:29:15,535
MARISHA: Roll like you're Percy!

3209
03:29:15,535 --> 03:29:18,700
MATT: What did you roll?

3210
03:29:18,700 --> 03:29:21,882
TRAVIS: A four.

3211
03:29:21,882 --> 03:29:23,850
MATT: With advantage?

3212
03:29:23,850 --> 03:29:25,140
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3213
03:29:25,140 --> 03:29:30,938
MATT: Wow. With that, Grog, now you realize you've
been on the wrong side of this battlefield the

3214
03:29:30,938 --> 03:29:36,615
whole time. And your allies are being assaulted by
individuals that claim to be your friends but

3215
03:29:36,690 --> 03:29:42,166
might be completely against this whole
circumstance. Your allegiance switches for now to

3216
03:29:42,166 --> 03:29:49,048
defend them at all costs. That's going to end his
turn. Pike!

3217
03:29:49,048 --> 03:29:53,821
TRAVIS: Wait. I'm raging. Can I be charmed?

3218
03:29:53,821 --> 03:29:57,535
(cheering)

3219
03:29:57,535 --> 03:30:06,524
MATT: That's a good notification to make. The
charm effect hits your mind. This is why you read

3220
03:30:06,524 --> 03:30:09,954
your abilities, guys. I don't remember all the
details.

3221
03:30:09,954 --> 03:30:12,307
SAM: Best question of the night!

3222
03:30:12,307 --> 03:30:14,952
LIAM: Oh my god!

3223
03:30:14,952 --> 03:30:17,770
TRAVIS: Intelligence of six. It takes a second!

3224
03:30:17,770 --> 03:30:24,945
MATT: As you see this look, you feel the influence
begin to pry. But it isn't enough to push through

3225
03:30:24,945 --> 03:30:26,686
the red and blazing anger--

3226
03:30:26,686 --> 03:30:28,254
TALIESIN: Yeah!

3227
03:30:28,254 --> 03:30:32,145
LIAM: That was the thin red line, Travis.

3228
03:30:32,145 --> 03:30:40,498
MATT: With that, you see the expression of intent
and some worry on Sylas's face, ending his turn.

3229
03:30:40,498 --> 03:30:42,005
Pike, what are you doing?

3230
03:30:42,005 --> 03:30:51,201
ASHLEY: My turn? Okay, so I would like to Channel
Divinity and Destroy Undead?

3231
03:30:51,201 --> 03:30:52,377
MARISHA: Yes!

3232
03:30:52,377 --> 03:30:54,735
SAM: This is what we hired you for!

3233
03:30:54,735 --> 03:31:02,119
MATT: Just as a heads up, Destroy Undead, for the
most part, is only effective against lower-level

3234
03:31:02,214 --> 03:31:07,977
undead. Knowing that Sylas is a vampire, it might
not have the desired effect that you're thinking

3235
03:31:07,977 --> 03:31:09,214
it might.

3236
03:31:09,214 --> 03:31:10,121
ASHLEY: Okay.

3237
03:31:10,121 --> 03:31:16,056
MATT: Just as a heads up. You can still Turn
Undead and it may make him afraid of you.

3238
03:31:16,056 --> 03:31:18,187
But that is--

3239
03:31:18,187 --> 03:31:19,579
ASHLEY: Let's give it a try!

3240
03:31:19,579 --> 03:31:20,854
TRAVIS: I like it!

3241
03:31:20,854 --> 03:31:22,925
MATT: All right. We're bringing this up here real
fast.

3242
03:31:22,925 --> 03:31:24,970
ASHLEY: How close am I to him?

3243
03:31:24,970 --> 03:31:26,125
LAURA: Pretty close.

3244
03:31:26,125 --> 03:31:28,152
LIAM: Pretty close. 20 feet.

3245
03:31:28,152 --> 03:31:34,450
ASHLEY: You know what, I feel like I want to hit
him with my Mace of Disruption.

3246
03:31:34,450 --> 03:31:35,844
MATT: If you want to!

3247
03:31:35,844 --> 03:31:37,810
LIAM: He's rough.

3248
03:31:37,810 --> 03:31:44,530
MATT: So instead you run up, charging towards him,
shield up in front of you. Pike, her blazing

3249
03:31:44,530 --> 03:31:49,188
radiant form, the energy rippling off from behind
her. You pull back your mace, and as it swings

3250
03:31:49,188 --> 03:31:54,080
through the air, a quick flicker of angelic wings
appear at your back as your mace swings down

3251
03:31:54,080 --> 03:31:55,745
towards him. Go ahead and roll your attack.

3252
03:31:55,745 --> 03:32:05,916
ASHLEY: Come on. Okay, 16. But I'm going to use
War God's Blessing and add ten.

3253
03:32:05,916 --> 03:32:07,328
MATT: Yes, you can do that.

3254
03:32:07,328 --> 03:32:10,205
TRAVIS: War God's Blessing?

3255
03:32:10,205 --> 03:32:14,832
MATT: Okay. War God's Blessing.

3256
03:32:14,832 --> 03:32:18,574
TRAVIS: She has inspiration from you too, right?

3257
03:32:18,574 --> 03:32:21,382
SAM: But has she rolled yet?

3258
03:32:21,382 --> 03:32:24,655
MATT: Yep, when any creature within 30 feet makes
an attack roll you can use your reaction to grant

3259
03:32:24,655 --> 03:32:36,812
that creature-- usually it's against other
creatures. Okay. War God's Blessing you can only

3260
03:32:36,812 --> 03:32:41,403
use on other creatures, but you do have Channel
Divinity: Guided Strike, which you can use on

3261
03:32:41,403 --> 03:32:45,145
yourself. It's essentially the same thing. You
give yourself plus ten bonus to the roll.

3262
03:32:45,145 --> 03:32:46,506
ASHLEY: Okay.

3263
03:32:46,506 --> 03:32:48,647
MATT: So you use your Channel Divinity: Guided
Strike instead?

3264
03:32:48,647 --> 03:32:49,663
ASHLEY: Got it.

3265
03:32:49,663 --> 03:32:52,068
MATT: Okay. So that would bring you to 26? That
would hit.

3266
03:32:52,068 --> 03:32:53,114
ASHLEY: Okay.

3267
03:32:53,114 --> 03:33:01,232
MATT: Okay. All right, so you slam down onto Sylas
with your Mace of Disruption. Go ahead and roll

3268
03:33:01,232 --> 03:33:03,227
damage on that. He is considered an undead.

3269
03:33:03,227 --> 03:33:04,374
LAURA: Kill him!

3270
03:33:04,374 --> 03:33:05,516
LIAM: A thousand pieces.

3271
03:33:05,516 --> 03:33:07,474
ASHLEY: How many times do I roll?

3272
03:33:07,474 --> 03:33:12,064
MATT: Well you roll your damage, and it does an
additional 2d6 radiant damage.

3273
03:33:12,064 --> 03:33:13,460
TALIESIN: Damn!

3274
03:33:13,460 --> 03:33:16,792
LIAM: The mace damage--

3275
03:33:16,792 --> 03:33:20,350
ASHLEY: Okay, got it. Sorry guys, sorry. I'm
back.

3276
03:33:20,350 --> 03:33:29,811
LIAM: Break into a million pieces.

3277
03:33:29,811 --> 03:33:34,302
LAURA: I love you, too. Your headset looks really
pretty!

3278
03:33:34,302 --> 03:33:35,974
ASHLEY: Thanks!

3279
03:33:35,974 --> 03:33:41,559
TALIESIN: It's like looking at the Technicolor
logo.

3280
03:33:41,559 --> 03:33:44,564
TRAVIS: Everybody get their heads down, like
Ashley.

3281
03:33:44,564 --> 03:33:45,974
ASHLEY: Okay, 21!

3282
03:33:46,045 --> 03:33:47,476
MATT: 21 points of damage?

3283
03:33:47,476 --> 03:33:48,690
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3284
03:33:48,690 --> 03:33:54,962
MATT: Okay, as per the effect of the spell, he now
has to make a wisdom saving throw, which he does

3285
03:33:54,962 --> 03:34:00,751
succeed. If he failed, he would have been
destroyed. However, on a success, he is still

3286
03:34:00,751 --> 03:34:06,910
afraid of you. So he is now considered afraid of
Pike. Disadvantage on all attack rolls.

3287
03:34:06,910 --> 03:34:10,154
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah, he is! Let them know, Pike!

3288
03:34:10,154 --> 03:34:14,809
MATT: Until the end of your next turn. Awesome,
Pike! Anything else you want to do on your turn,

3289
03:34:14,809 --> 03:34:16,207
or is that it?

3290
03:34:16,207 --> 03:34:21,407
ASHLEY: I would love to go up to Vax, but I don't
think I can, right?

3291
03:34:21,407 --> 03:34:22,532
MATT: No.

3292
03:34:22,532 --> 03:34:25,754
ASHLEY: Okay. Then I'll stay, I'll stay.

3293
03:34:25,754 --> 03:34:28,416
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn Pike. Vex, you're
up.

3294
03:34:28,416 --> 03:34:30,208
LAURA: Awesome, I'm going to shoot him.

3295
03:34:30,208 --> 03:34:31,581
MATT: You're going to shoot Sylas?

3296
03:34:31,581 --> 03:34:33,001
LAURA: Yeah, with holy arrows.

3297
03:34:33,001 --> 03:34:37,208
MATT: Okay.

3298
03:34:37,208 --> 03:34:41,094
LAURA: That does not hit him. Come on. 19?

3299
03:34:41,094 --> 03:34:44,701
MATT: 19 hits. Just barely.

3300
03:34:44,701 --> 03:34:52,442
LAURA: 17, plus two holy damage.

3301
03:34:52,442 --> 03:34:54,910
MATT: So the first attack missed?

3302
03:34:54,910 --> 03:34:55,915
LAURA: Yeah.

3303
03:34:55,915 --> 03:34:56,972
MATT: And the second one hit?

3304
03:34:56,972 --> 03:34:58,029
LAURA: Yeah. 19.

3305
03:34:58,029 --> 03:35:02,340
MATT: 19 damage, all right. As the arrows (thud,
thud), one hits the armor and streaks off and

3306
03:35:02,340 --> 03:35:07,117
shatters against the green glass stonework of the
top of the ziggurat. The second one strikes him in

3307
03:35:07,117 --> 03:35:11,448
the back of the neck. You see a blast of radiant
energy crosses his throat. He reaches up and tries

3308
03:35:11,448 --> 03:35:16,100
to grab for the arrow, but the arrow itself is
disintegrated by the blast of holy energy, leaving

3309
03:35:16,100 --> 03:35:21,444
a gaping wound in the back of his neck. He's still
standing, but you can see his form is now falling

3310
03:35:21,444 --> 03:35:26,300
apart. Parts of ash are beginning to pour off his
flesh. He's looking really rough.

3311
03:35:26,300 --> 03:35:32,427
All right. That finishes Vex's turn. Unless you
want to move? Stay where you are?

3312
03:35:32,427 --> 03:35:40,232
LAURA: I'm afraid my flying potion's going to
start to wear off soon, so I'm going to move. Is

3313
03:35:40,232 --> 03:35:43,608
there a roof? On that middle compound building?

3314
03:35:43,608 --> 03:35:45,509
MATT: From what you can see, no. It is open.

3315
03:35:45,589 --> 03:35:46,357
LAURA: Oh, really?

3316
03:35:46,357 --> 03:35:47,205
MATT: Yeah.

3317
03:35:47,205 --> 03:35:48,811
LAURA: Can I land on top of the pillar?

3318
03:35:48,811 --> 03:35:51,050
MATT: The pillar holds a slight overhang, so you
can land on top of the overhang if you want.

3319
03:35:51,050 --> 03:35:52,012
LAURA: Yeah!

3320
03:35:52,012 --> 03:35:56,208
MATT: All right, so you land on top of the
overhang, stopping there. Which blocks all view

3321
03:35:56,208 --> 03:35:58,028
from beneath this line, there, but--

3322
03:35:58,028 --> 03:35:59,184
LAURA: But I can still see--

3323
03:35:59,184 --> 03:36:00,486
MATT: You could peek around if you want.

3324
03:36:00,486 --> 03:36:01,432
LAURA: Yeah, okay.

3325
03:36:01,432 --> 03:36:02,781
MATT: Okay. Percy, you're up.

3326
03:36:02,781 --> 03:36:13,689
TALIESIN: Okay. First thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to pull out the Pepperbox. And I'm going to

3327
03:36:13,689 --> 03:36:17,397
take a shot at Sylas, and I'm going to get him to
drop his sword.

3328
03:36:17,397 --> 03:36:19,471
MATT: Okay.

3329
03:36:19,471 --> 03:36:24,513
TALIESIN: So, let's see.

3330
03:36:24,513 --> 03:36:25,742
SAM: You're not going to kill him?

3331
03:36:25,742 --> 03:36:29,041
TALIESIN: Nope! Not yet. Just in case things go
bad-- and I also just want to make sure-- that's a

3332
03:36:29,041 --> 03:36:30,405
26?

3333
03:36:30,405 --> 03:36:37,517
MATT: Hits. No damage, but he drops his weapon?

3334
03:36:37,517 --> 03:36:38,645
TALIESIN: But he drops his weapon.

3335
03:36:38,645 --> 03:36:43,014
MATT: So with that, (bullet impact) the blade he
was holding clatters to the ground before him, the

3336
03:36:43,014 --> 03:36:46,054
onyx blade shining in what low light there is
around this temple.

3337
03:36:46,054 --> 03:36:54,059
TALIESIN: Now I'm going to take a shot at him.
That's a 29.

3338
03:36:54,059 --> 03:36:55,403
MATT: Hits.

3339
03:36:55,403 --> 03:37:06,740
TALIESIN: That does... ten points of damage?

3340
03:37:06,740 --> 03:37:14,925
MATT: Ten points of damage? As that bullet hits
him (soft impact) you see he begins to dissipate.

3341
03:37:14,925 --> 03:37:25,279
And then turns into a mist form in the space where
he is. He is currently now a form of mist.

3342
03:37:25,279 --> 03:37:28,835
LAURA: So he can go heal himself unless we can get
him.

3343
03:37:28,835 --> 03:37:40,985
TALIESIN: She's going to take care of this. How
close am I to Lady Briarwood?

3344
03:37:40,985 --> 03:37:42,526
MATT: You're ten feet from her.

3345
03:37:42,526 --> 03:37:56,903
TALIESIN: Ten feet? That's close enough, I guess.
I'm going to take a couple of steps back, and I'm

3346
03:37:56,903 --> 03:38:02,535
going to do a fire shot and an ice shot with my
last two shots.

3347
03:38:02,535 --> 03:38:04,655
MATT: Well, you've already done two shots.

3348
03:38:04,655 --> 03:38:12,097
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. I'll fire shot with my next
shot. Does she currently have advantage or no?

3349
03:38:12,097 --> 03:38:14,082
MATT: No, because it has not come back to her.

3350
03:38:14,082 --> 03:38:16,098
TALIESIN: Okay, so I'm going to also put
sharpshooter on that.

3351
03:38:16,098 --> 03:38:17,530
MATT: Okay.

3352
03:38:17,530 --> 03:38:23,146
TALIESIN: Yay. (counting) 26 to hit?

3353
03:38:23,146 --> 03:38:24,194
MATT: That hits.

3354
03:38:24,194 --> 03:38:32,121
TALIESIN: So that's-- plus--

3355
03:38:32,121 --> 03:38:35,069
SAM: Is that her right there? No that's
Cassandra.

3356
03:38:35,069 --> 03:38:36,983
MATT: That's Cassandra. That's Briarwood, right
there.

3357
03:38:36,983 --> 03:38:53,599
TALIESIN: Oh, and plus the Hex! So that's
(counting) 24 points of damage plus two points of

3358
03:38:53,599 --> 03:38:54,709
fire damage.

3359
03:38:54,709 --> 03:39:00,423
MATT: Whew, nice. The shot (bang) blasts into the
side of her face. You can see part of her jawbone

3360
03:39:00,423 --> 03:39:06,826
is cracked as part of this, and her ear is blown
off to one side of her face, (choked groan) and

3361
03:39:06,826 --> 03:39:08,993
she cradles it to her side as (grunts).

3362
03:39:08,993 --> 03:39:10,519
LAURA: Like a ketchup packet!

3363
03:39:10,519 --> 03:39:12,865
TALIESIN: Let's spend an action surge and keep
enjoying this!

3364
03:39:12,865 --> 03:39:14,915
LIAM: Our cleric giggles from Vasselheim.

3365
03:39:14,915 --> 03:39:18,689
TALIESIN: Why don't we take a--

3366
03:39:18,689 --> 03:39:23,890
LIAM: If there's a time to blow your wad, it's
now.

3367
03:39:23,890 --> 03:39:32,958
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's take a... violent shot on
top of that.

3368
03:39:32,958 --> 03:39:34,247
LAURA: Violent shot?

3369
03:39:34,247 --> 03:39:42,773
TALIESIN: I use the violent shot action with the
ice damage. Let's see what that does. Natural 20!

3370
03:39:42,773 --> 03:39:45,281
This is going to be ugly as fuck.

3371
03:39:45,281 --> 03:39:48,448
TRAVIS: (laughing) Of course it is!

3372
03:39:48,448 --> 03:39:50,958
MARISHA: Of course.

3373
03:39:50,958 --> 03:39:54,862
MATT: And this is all piercing damage, right?

3374
03:39:54,862 --> 03:40:03,456
TALIESIN: Oh my god. This is so fucking bad, is
what this is about to be. Oh my god, this is going

3375
03:40:03,456 --> 03:40:15,608
to be so-- let me get these additional dice. Okay,
so let's start doing this. Do all of the dice

3376
03:40:15,608 --> 03:40:17,224
rolls get doubled?

3377
03:40:17,224 --> 03:40:19,598
MATT: All of the dice for this roll.

3378
03:40:19,598 --> 03:40:21,579
TALIESIN: All of the dice for this roll. Oh boy.

3379
03:40:21,579 --> 03:40:23,430
MATT: Roll the dice and then double it.

3380
03:40:23,430 --> 03:40:24,462
TALIESIN: Okay.

3381
03:40:24,462 --> 03:40:33,232
MARISHA: High rolls. Big money, no whammies. It
could be worse.

3382
03:40:33,232 --> 03:40:46,826
TALIESIN: (counts quietly) 42 points of damage
plus eight points of ice damage.

3383
03:40:46,826 --> 03:40:56,914
MATT: Okay. This blast hits her in the side of the
shoulder, and the cloak catches fire for a moment

3384
03:40:56,914 --> 03:41:00,971
before dispersing, and you can see the impact.
There's blood now seeping into her robe. She's

3385
03:41:00,971 --> 03:41:06,242
looking rough, but you've noticed with each of
these shots, the impact you're used to doing with

3386
03:41:06,242 --> 03:41:10,557
these shots is not doing the full impact you would
expect, especially with the force of these blows.

3387
03:41:10,557 --> 03:41:16,674
Every shot you've taken on her in particular. That
ends your turn?

3388
03:41:16,674 --> 03:41:25,112
TALIESIN: No, I've still got two more shots.
Actually, I get my grit point back from that

3389
03:41:25,112 --> 03:41:28,846
because that was a natural 20, so that was a free
shot.

3390
03:41:28,846 --> 03:41:32,243
MATT: When do you reload, by the way?

3391
03:41:32,243 --> 03:41:37,150
TALIESIN: I have two more shots, and then I have
to reload. I'm keeping track. I'm being good.

3392
03:41:37,150 --> 03:41:49,409
Let's hit her in the legs.

3393
03:41:49,409 --> 03:41:51,496
MATT: Okay.

3394
03:41:51,496 --> 03:41:59,410
TALIESIN: That's 20 to hit?

3395
03:41:59,410 --> 03:42:04,549
MATT: 20 to hit. This is with your minus five? Are
you taking a sharpshooter shot on this?

3396
03:42:04,549 --> 03:42:06,033
TALIESIN: Yeah. 20 to hit?

3397
03:42:06,033 --> 03:42:08,054
MATT: You rolled a what?

3398
03:42:08,054 --> 03:42:10,281
TALIESIN: No, 20 total to hit.

3399
03:42:10,281 --> 03:42:11,868
MATT: Right. Okay.

3400
03:42:11,868 --> 03:42:13,372
TALIESIN: I rolled a 13.

3401
03:42:13,372 --> 03:42:15,376
MATT: Yeah. Okay, so that does hit, yes.

3402
03:42:15,376 --> 03:42:24,707
TALIESIN: Because she has her disadvantage. She
needs to make a constitution saving throw.

3403
03:42:24,707 --> 03:42:27,012
MATT: 22?

3404
03:42:27,012 --> 03:42:31,970
TALIESIN: DC equals eight plus my proficiency mod
plus my dexterity mod.

3405
03:42:31,970 --> 03:42:35,039
MATT: Plus ten, so 18.

3406
03:42:35,039 --> 03:42:39,023
TALIESIN: She made it. She didn't fall, but she
still takes some damage, so let's see what she

3407
03:42:39,023 --> 03:42:50,833
does. Ten, 12, 22, 28 points of damage.

3408
03:42:50,833 --> 03:42:52,216
MATT: All righty.

3409
03:42:52,216 --> 03:43:02,612
TALIESIN: And because this is really annoying me,
I'm going to give her a gut shot. Torso shot. Same

3410
03:43:02,612 --> 03:43:04,512
thing, sharpshooter.

3411
03:43:04,512 --> 03:43:07,417
LIAM: I'm seeing this all in slow motion.

3412
03:43:07,417 --> 03:43:12,649
MARISHA: Throwing bullets.

3413
03:43:12,649 --> 03:43:27,532
TALIESIN: 27 points of damage. And she has a
disadvantage on strength and dexterity checks for

3414
03:43:27,532 --> 03:43:29,612
the rest of the round. For one full round.

3415
03:43:29,612 --> 03:43:31,039
MATT: Good to know.

3416
03:43:31,039 --> 03:43:34,622
TALIESIN: I'm going to back up a little bit, for
the rest of my--

3417
03:43:34,622 --> 03:43:35,800
MATT: Over here?

3418
03:43:35,800 --> 03:43:37,026
TALIESIN: Yeah, that way.

3419
03:43:37,026 --> 03:43:38,971
LAURA: Get out of her view?

3420
03:43:38,971 --> 03:43:42,387
MATT: Sure. That ends your turn, Percy?

3421
03:43:42,387 --> 03:43:44,285
TALIESIN: (laughs) Yeah.

3422
03:43:44,285 --> 03:43:51,191
MATT: Cassandra, seeing all this go down and
having this crisis moment, picks up her sword,

3423
03:43:51,191 --> 03:44:02,405
rushes over, and uses her action to pull out one
of the potions that you gave her, the greater

3424
03:44:02,405 --> 03:44:07,187
healing potion, and feed it to the ailing
Briarwood.

3425
03:44:07,187 --> 03:44:08,494
TALIESIN: Damn it, girl!

3426
03:44:08,494 --> 03:44:11,971
SAM: I gave her one. I gave her a greater.

3427
03:44:11,971 --> 03:44:14,778
LAURA: A greater? We wasted a greater?!

3428
03:44:14,778 --> 03:44:21,867
SAM: I'm a nice guy! I can't resist the charm of a
woman, especially one who looks identical to you.

3429
03:44:21,867 --> 03:44:28,006
MATT: Her wounds close up a little bit. The ear
wound heals over a little bit, and she wipes her

3430
03:44:28,006 --> 03:44:32,401
mouth. "Thank you, dear. Sylas! To the ritual!"

3431
03:44:32,401 --> 03:44:35,177
LAURA: He's a mist.

3432
03:44:35,177 --> 03:44:37,788
MATT: Keyleth, it's your turn.

3433
03:44:37,788 --> 03:44:40,398
TALIESIN: Do it. Do it, girl!

3434
03:44:40,398 --> 03:44:41,660
LIAM: Burn him.

3435
03:44:41,660 --> 03:44:46,201
MARISHA: Okay, so I turn and I start shouting to
the mist and I say, what's the matter, Sylas?

3436
03:44:46,201 --> 03:44:52,685
Afraid of a little gnome and a druid? And I blast
him with Sunbeam.

3437
03:44:52,685 --> 03:44:53,777
TRAVIS: Good line.

3438
03:44:53,777 --> 03:44:55,231
LAURA: (laughing) That was the lamest thing.

3439
03:44:55,231 --> 03:45:00,701
MARISHA: Thanks! I'm not good with lines.
Keyleth isn't good with lines. Are you afraid of

3440
03:45:00,701 --> 03:45:04,916
us? I heard Percy try to do lines, and I'm like,
that's what badasses do.

3441
03:45:04,916 --> 03:45:12,410
MATT: I guess in this particular instance I want
to ask you:

3442
03:45:12,410 --> 03:45:13,718
How do you want to do this?

3443
03:45:13,718 --> 03:45:19,908
(cheering)

3444
03:45:19,908 --> 03:45:21,432
LIAM: Sorry, cursed gun!

3445
03:45:21,432 --> 03:45:29,047
MATT: There's still a semi-visible form of his
body, but in a mist form. It's trying to slowly

3446
03:45:29,047 --> 03:45:31,536
escape off the top of this structure.

3447
03:45:31,536 --> 03:45:33,234
MARISHA: Okay. Pike is standing right next to
him?

3448
03:45:33,234 --> 03:45:34,225
MATT: Correct.

3449
03:45:34,225 --> 03:45:42,659
MARISHA: I'm going to use Pike and use the light
that I have off Pike and combine it to do a joint

3450
03:45:42,659 --> 03:45:49,466
Sunbeam, holy bomb.

3451
03:45:49,466 --> 03:45:50,334
MATT: Okay.

3452
03:45:50,334 --> 03:45:51,768
MARISHA: Boom.

3453
03:45:51,768 --> 03:45:52,492
MATT: Great.

3454
03:45:52,492 --> 03:45:58,500
LIAM: He's going to eat a bag of holy dicks is
what you're saying, right?

3455
03:45:58,583 --> 03:46:02,657
MARISHA: Yeah, I want him to eat a bag of holy
dicks. Now explain that, please.

3456
03:46:02,657 --> 03:46:04,937
Make it sound great.

3457
03:46:04,937 --> 03:46:12,401
MATT: So. Looking over at Pike, already ready with
her mace up in the air and the mist recoiling from

3458
03:46:12,401 --> 03:46:16,936
her. You glance at each other, have that
connective point, and as Pike brings up her

3459
03:46:16,936 --> 03:46:22,538
shield, you bring back your Sunbeam and throw it
towards the shield, arcing it in his direction as

3460
03:46:22,538 --> 03:46:26,844
she ricochets the reflection of the actual
sunlight back at him at the same time.

3461
03:46:26,844 --> 03:46:28,452
LAURA: That was way cooler than what you said.

3462
03:46:28,452 --> 03:46:30,655
MARISHA: Yeah, way cooler! I knew he'd bring it
through.

3463
03:46:30,655 --> 03:46:35,782
MATT: As it sprays across, the beams themselves
seem to form nearly phallic rays.

3464
03:46:35,782 --> 03:46:40,862
(laughter)

3465
03:46:40,862 --> 03:46:44,906
MATT: Tearing through the mist, and with an
echoing scream, you hear Sylas's voice ring out,

3466
03:46:44,906 --> 03:46:50,936
(screams) as the mist is immediately dissipated
and disintegrated and his form is no more.

3467
03:46:50,936 --> 03:46:56,084
(cheering)

3468
03:46:56,084 --> 03:46:58,324
MARISHA: High five, Pike!

3469
03:46:58,324 --> 03:47:02,629
LAURA: How does it feel, Lady Briarwood?

3470
03:47:02,629 --> 03:47:08,798
MATT: She, looking over her shoulder, still
looking at him as she's called to him to go join

3471
03:47:08,798 --> 03:47:14,246
in the altar room, the ritual room, looks over and
sees his mist form. In slow motion, from her

3472
03:47:14,246 --> 03:47:20,921
perspective, she sees Keyleth step forward, wind
blowing around her, releasing this beam and

3473
03:47:20,921 --> 03:47:29,183
watching him be disintegrated. Immediately, her
eyes open wide and she screams out, "No! Sylas!"

3474
03:47:29,183 --> 03:47:35,722
and you can see her whole body shaking now. The
horror of seeing her partner, the love of her

3475
03:47:35,722 --> 03:47:43,086
life, disintegrated before her. Tears immediately
burst down her face, and her hands are shaking

3476
03:47:43,086 --> 03:47:50,328
there as she screams out, "You can't! I broke the
world for us! No."

3477
03:47:50,328 --> 03:47:52,594
That's the end of your turn?

3478
03:47:52,594 --> 03:47:54,695
LIAM: May I ask a question?

3479
03:47:54,695 --> 03:47:55,742
MATT: Yes.

3480
03:47:55,742 --> 03:47:58,815
LIAM: Does Cassandra's charm come from Sylas or
Lady Briarwood?

3481
03:47:58,815 --> 03:48:04,313
MATT: At this point, you have no idea.

3482
03:48:04,313 --> 03:48:06,077
LAURA: What about yours?

3483
03:48:06,077 --> 03:48:08,018
LIAM: From Lady Briarwood, yeah.

3484
03:48:08,018 --> 03:48:09,174
SAM: The lady.

3485
03:48:09,174 --> 03:48:10,286
LAURA: The lady.

3486
03:48:10,286 --> 03:48:14,114
MATT: Yours is fine. All right, does that end your
turn, Keyleth?

3487
03:48:14,114 --> 03:48:17,407
MARISHA: Yeah.

3488
03:48:17,407 --> 03:48:25,490
MATT: All righty. So, with that, it brings us to
the top of the initiative round. It is now Lady

3489
03:48:25,490 --> 03:48:36,310
Delilah Briarwood's turn. Looking around, heaving
with anger and frustration, she looks around her

3490
03:48:36,310 --> 03:48:40,959
area and the tears streak down her face, blood
streaking down one side of her head. She looks at

3491
03:48:40,959 --> 03:48:47,668
Cassandra, who right now is faltering. Seeing
everything closing around her, she goes, "It's too

3492
03:48:47,668 --> 03:48:55,732
"soon, but it's our only chance." And with that,
she is going to step around here.

3493
03:48:55,732 --> 03:48:58,871
LIAM: Somebody hit her. Hit her!

3494
03:48:58,871 --> 03:49:01,850
MATT: She's still in combat with you, so you don't
get an attack of opportunity. Keyleth, you do, if

3495
03:49:01,850 --> 03:49:03,743
you want to try and swing towards her.

3496
03:49:03,743 --> 03:49:05,593
MARISHA: Can I use my sunlight that I have up?

3497
03:49:05,593 --> 03:49:07,376
MATT: No, you have to make a combat strike.

3498
03:49:07,376 --> 03:49:08,410
MARISHA: My staff?

3499
03:49:08,410 --> 03:49:09,378
LAURA: Trip her!

3500
03:49:09,378 --> 03:49:10,829
MARISHA: Can I go for a trip?

3501
03:49:10,829 --> 03:49:14,979
MATT: No, this is just a melee attack.

3502
03:49:14,979 --> 03:49:17,282
MARISHA: Fine, I'm going to bean her in the head.
Natural 20!

3503
03:49:17,282 --> 03:49:22,052
MATT: Okay! Roll damage.

3504
03:49:22,052 --> 03:49:24,213
LIAM: We've got the MVP over here.

3505
03:49:24,213 --> 03:49:29,927
MARISHA: 12 damage! Bam!

3506
03:49:29,927 --> 03:49:34,699
MATT: Crack! You hit her in the back of the head
as she stumbles forward and looks about the rest

3507
03:49:34,699 --> 03:49:42,702
of you. She is using her last 5th-level spell to
attempt to cast another Dimension Door, out of the

3508
03:49:42,702 --> 03:49:45,551
sight of the one who previously dispelled it.

3509
03:49:45,551 --> 03:49:49,014
SAM: Can I Counterspell that?

3510
03:49:49,014 --> 03:49:53,869
MATT: You have no visual on her. She is behind the
pillar. This time, she knew where you were and was

3511
03:49:53,869 --> 03:49:57,502
not about to let that happen again. She disappears
behind the pillar, and you guys watch her step

3512
03:49:57,502 --> 03:49:58,960
into the doorway and vanish from sight.

3513
03:49:58,960 --> 03:49:59,755
LAURA: Seriously?

3514
03:49:59,755 --> 03:50:01,029
MATT: She's still Hunter's Marked.

3515
03:50:01,029 --> 03:50:02,108
LAURA: She's Hunter's Marked!

3516
03:50:02,108 --> 03:50:03,822
MATT: You still have Hex on her, for as long as
that lasts.

3517
03:50:03,822 --> 03:50:04,992
TALIESIN: That lasts a while.

3518
03:50:04,992 --> 03:50:08,861
LAURA: Is he under the thing, still? Or did it
break?

3519
03:50:08,861 --> 03:50:15,470
MATT: The flight lasts for an hour. The potion
lasts for an hour, and it's probably been about--

3520
03:50:15,470 --> 03:50:17,017
LIAM: No, she's asking if I'm still--

3521
03:50:17,017 --> 03:50:21,540
MATT: You currently? Yes. Make another
constitution saving throw.

3522
03:50:21,540 --> 03:50:27,036
LIAM: Come on. Big roll. 13 plus nothing is 13.

3523
03:50:27,036 --> 03:50:34,132
MATT: All right, so as you guys all look around
yourselves, Sylas disintegrated, Cassandra still

3524
03:50:34,132 --> 03:50:38,588
holding the blades and looking around and is going
from a fight position, almost like a cornered

3525
03:50:38,588 --> 03:50:44,685
creature, to looking at the sundering of her
brother and is looking completely frazzled and

3526
03:50:44,685 --> 03:50:49,732
confused. She's on the verge of tears or a rage of
her own.

3527
03:50:49,732 --> 03:50:54,382
You look over and see your brother down below and
is just standing there, his daggers dropped to the

3528
03:50:54,382 --> 03:50:56,882
ground in front of him, and has been staring into
space this entire time.

3529
03:50:56,882 --> 03:51:00,486
LAURA: I float down in front of him and slap him
across the face.

3530
03:51:00,486 --> 03:51:04,218
MATT: Like that? Okay. Make another saving throw.

3531
03:51:04,218 --> 03:51:07,407
LIAM: Nope.

3532
03:51:07,407 --> 03:51:11,151
MATT: Okay. You slap, slap. He's taking it.

3533
03:51:11,151 --> 03:51:13,366
ASHLEY: Can I go over to Vax?

3534
03:51:13,366 --> 03:51:17,236
TRAVIS: Cassandra's still up, right?

3535
03:51:17,236 --> 03:51:18,347
MATT: Cassandra is.

3536
03:51:18,347 --> 03:51:22,269
ASHLEY: I'm going to Remove Curse on him.

3537
03:51:22,269 --> 03:51:43,024
MATT: Okay. You cast Remove Curse. Let me see.
This is not considered a curse, so as the spell

3538
03:51:43,024 --> 03:51:48,157
alleviates its energy into Vax, he still stands
there, staring into space.

3539
03:51:48,157 --> 03:51:49,409
LAURA: Oh god.

3540
03:51:49,409 --> 03:51:52,356
TRAVIS: Oh, wait, are we slapping Vax? Let me
try.

3541
03:51:52,356 --> 03:51:55,363
LIAM: Yeah. You said something about a minute
before, though, didn't you?

3542
03:51:55,363 --> 03:52:00,443
MATT: Yeah, so a little time goes by and then
eventually it wears off.

3543
03:52:00,443 --> 03:52:02,922
TALIESIN: I'm going to start looking at that
door.

3544
03:52:02,922 --> 03:52:04,760
TRAVIS: Is Cassandra still there?

3545
03:52:04,760 --> 03:52:05,987
MATT: Yes, she is.

3546
03:52:05,987 --> 03:52:08,540
TRAVIS: Can I grab her by the neck and walk her to
the edge of the pyramid?

3547
03:52:08,633 --> 03:52:12,583
MATT: Yeah. You grab her, lift her. (choking
noise)

3548
03:52:12,583 --> 03:52:13,813
TALIESIN: No, no! No.

3549
03:52:13,813 --> 03:52:15,718
MATT: Drops her weapons as Grog takes her to the
edge.

3550
03:52:15,718 --> 03:52:18,301
TALIESIN: No, let's not. Let's not.

3551
03:52:18,301 --> 03:52:20,970
TRAVIS: Why not?

3552
03:52:20,970 --> 03:52:31,103
LIAM: I walk up to Grog and her, and I face Percy
and repeat what Grog said. Why not?

3553
03:52:31,103 --> 03:52:34,771
SAM: Is he still under her spell?

3554
03:52:34,771 --> 03:52:43,117
TALIESIN: She's been here a very long time. Let's
just knock her unconscious and let her be.

3555
03:52:43,117 --> 03:52:46,969
LIAM: I turn towards her, and I punch her across
the jaw as hard as I can.

3556
03:52:46,969 --> 03:52:51,393
MATT: At this point, with the damage she's taken
and the mental shock she's in and the current

3557
03:52:51,393 --> 03:52:55,065
circumstance, the one hit (whack) clocks her, and
she goes unconscious in his grip. Limp.

3558
03:52:55,065 --> 03:52:57,178
LAURA: You can handcuff her behind her back.

3559
03:52:57,178 --> 03:52:58,535
TRAVIS: We do have manacles.

3560
03:52:58,535 --> 03:52:59,443
LAURA: Yeah.

3561
03:52:59,443 --> 03:53:01,640
SAM: Put her in the Bag of Holding.

3562
03:53:01,640 --> 03:53:03,509
OTHERS: No.

3563
03:53:03,509 --> 03:53:04,854
TALIESIN: Thank you.

3564
03:53:04,854 --> 03:53:09,032
LAURA: Maybe Greater Restoration her.

3565
03:53:09,032 --> 03:53:11,884
ASHLEY: Yeah, can I Greater Restoration on her?

3566
03:53:11,884 --> 03:53:15,034
MATT: Do you have another level of that spell?

3567
03:53:15,034 --> 03:53:20,384
ASHLEY: No.

3568
03:53:20,384 --> 03:53:23,154
MATT: Then you cannot. It's a 5th-level spell.

3569
03:53:23,154 --> 03:53:25,535
TALIESIN: We can save it for later.

3570
03:53:25,535 --> 03:53:26,975
ASHLEY: Keyleth?

3571
03:53:26,975 --> 03:53:29,908
TRAVIS: I take some of the manacles, and I manacle
her hands behind her back.

3572
03:53:29,908 --> 03:53:31,043
MATT: Okay.

3573
03:53:31,043 --> 03:53:32,562
MARISHA: What's up, Pike?

3574
03:53:32,562 --> 03:53:34,579
ASHLEY: Do you have Greater Restoration?

3575
03:53:34,579 --> 03:53:37,705
MARISHA: Not on me. Not today.

3576
03:53:37,705 --> 03:53:39,615
TALIESIN: I'm going to start working with that
door.

3577
03:53:39,615 --> 03:53:45,508
TRAVIS: And to be super shitty, I grab a length of
rope and wrap it around her ankles and tie it back

3578
03:53:45,508 --> 03:53:47,615
to her hands so she can't stand up.

3579
03:53:47,615 --> 03:53:50,554
LAURA: Oh. Sorry, Cassandra. That's going to
suck.

3580
03:53:50,554 --> 03:53:52,026
TRAVIS: She's got to stay there when she wakes
up.

3581
03:53:52,026 --> 03:53:58,849
MATT: All right. Bigby's Hand does last a minute,
if you want to keep it maintained. The minute has

3582
03:53:58,849 --> 03:54:00,683
passed at this time. It's probably going to pass.

3583
03:54:00,683 --> 03:54:06,628
SAM: All right, before it passes, it gives me a
quick deep-tissue massage.

3584
03:54:06,628 --> 03:54:07,907
MATT: Okay.

3585
03:54:07,907 --> 03:54:11,179
TRAVIS: Can I pick up Sylas's onyx sword?

3586
03:54:11,179 --> 03:54:12,811
MATT: You can, yeah.

3587
03:54:12,811 --> 03:54:15,812
TALIESIN: What does a common healing potion do, by
the way?

3588
03:54:15,812 --> 03:54:21,538
MATT: It'll require a short rest to attune and get
the nature of it, but it is a very beautiful new

3589
03:54:21,538 --> 03:54:22,705
weapon.

3590
03:54:22,705 --> 03:54:24,278
TRAVIS: Okay. I'll put it in the Bag of Holding.

3591
03:54:24,278 --> 03:54:28,532
TALIESIN: You picked up his sword? Good. That's
why I had him drop it.

3592
03:54:28,532 --> 03:54:29,899
TRAVIS: Yeah, I noticed.

3593
03:54:29,899 --> 03:54:31,754
MARISHA: So he wouldn't disintegrate with it?

3594
03:54:31,754 --> 03:54:35,683
TALIESIN: Yeah, and so one of us, possibly me,
could use it.

3595
03:54:35,683 --> 03:54:37,719
SAM: Have a better sword than your piece of shit?

3596
03:54:37,719 --> 03:54:39,770
TRAVIS: Do you want it?

3597
03:54:39,770 --> 03:54:41,295
MARISHA: We have to find her. She's somewhere
close.

3598
03:54:41,295 --> 03:54:43,171
TRAVIS: I'll give him the sword. He's got the onyx
sword.

3599
03:54:43,171 --> 03:54:46,247
MATT: There is a brooch also left on the ground
from the ashes left behind.

3600
03:54:46,247 --> 03:54:49,187
SAM: I'll pick it up and look at it.

3601
03:54:49,187 --> 03:54:53,309
MATT: Okay. These items will take a little time to
look over.

3602
03:54:53,309 --> 03:54:55,292
SAM: I'll look at it for a whole ten seconds.

3603
03:54:55,292 --> 03:54:56,458
MATT: Okay.

3604
03:54:56,458 --> 03:55:00,349
TALIESIN: Do I get my strength back, by the way?
I'm just down?

3605
03:55:00,349 --> 03:55:01,375
MATT: Just down.

3606
03:55:01,375 --> 03:55:06,118
LAURA: Can I see, from being on the roof, what's
inside the building? You said there's no roof to

3607
03:55:06,118 --> 03:55:09,217
that temple I was up on top of.

3608
03:55:09,217 --> 03:55:19,331
MATT: Correct. If you're looking inside of it
right now? You glance over. It's an open-roofed

3609
03:55:19,331 --> 03:55:25,240
square construct. There are two hallways that lead
to the inside on both sides. The walls have a

3610
03:55:25,240 --> 03:55:29,591
strange icy texture to them; it's hard to make out
the details from what little light is in there.

3611
03:55:29,591 --> 03:55:34,253
There is a central platform that rises up in the
middle. There is a stairway on the opposite side

3612
03:55:34,253 --> 03:55:39,672
of the room that leads up to that platform, and
there are a series of grooves in the ground that

3613
03:55:39,672 --> 03:55:44,065
form some sort of shape that you can't make out
from this viewpoint. You do see Lady Briarwood

3614
03:55:44,113 --> 03:55:46,004
atop that platform right now.

3615
03:55:46,004 --> 03:55:47,417
SAM: How far?

3616
03:55:47,417 --> 03:55:48,772
LAURA: She's inside the temple.

3617
03:55:48,772 --> 03:55:53,670
TALIESIN: Let's go in. I took a minor healing
potion. Is that 2d8?

3618
03:55:53,670 --> 03:55:57,251
MATT: A minor? A regular one is 2d4 plus two.

3619
03:55:57,251 --> 03:56:06,499
SAM: Here, I'll trade you one. I trade him a
greater for a common. I take the common.

3620
03:56:06,499 --> 03:56:08,258
TALIESIN: What's the greater do?

3621
03:56:08,258 --> 03:56:10,237
SAM: Greater is 4d4 plus four.

3622
03:56:10,237 --> 03:56:13,361
LAURA: Can I drop the rope down from the roof
where I'm at, so everybody can get up in?

3623
03:56:13,361 --> 03:56:16,693
MATT: Get up and over? Yeah, you can do that.

3624
03:56:16,693 --> 03:56:17,810
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to do that.

3625
03:56:17,810 --> 03:56:22,125
MATT: Okay. It'll take you a while to do that. As
you drop the rope--

3626
03:56:22,125 --> 03:56:25,275
LAURA: I don't know if you want to try the doors,
but I just thought we could get in.

3627
03:56:25,275 --> 03:56:29,099
MATT: Okay, you lower the rope.

3628
03:56:29,099 --> 03:56:37,691
LIAM: I'm going to walk up to my sister and take
her hand and squeeze it as hard as I can, and just

3629
03:56:37,691 --> 03:56:39,595
walk forward with her.

3630
03:56:39,595 --> 03:56:43,856
MATT: She's up on top of the roof. She lowers the
rope and starts taking you guys up one by one.

3631
03:56:43,856 --> 03:56:49,038
Vex, you do notice out of the corner of your eye
as you lower the rope, there is a flash of

3632
03:56:49,038 --> 03:56:54,563
greenish light from the center platform, and from
the distance, you can see Delilah is up on the

3633
03:56:54,563 --> 03:56:56,684
platform reading from some sort of scroll.

3634
03:56:56,684 --> 03:56:58,360
LIAM: How far away is she?

3635
03:56:58,360 --> 03:57:03,896
MATT: She's about 80 feet from you.

3636
03:57:03,896 --> 03:57:05,749
TALIESIN: I pull out Bad News.

3637
03:57:05,749 --> 03:57:10,352
MATT: None of you guys can see her. Only she sees
her. You guys are still on the ground. She's on

3638
03:57:10,352 --> 03:57:11,174
the roof.

3639
03:57:11,174 --> 03:57:12,895
LAURA: I lowered the rope so you guys can start
climbing up.

3640
03:57:12,895 --> 03:57:13,842
TALIESIN: I'm climbing up.

3641
03:57:13,842 --> 03:57:15,883
LIAM: Can I see her, if I've gone up to her?

3642
03:57:15,883 --> 03:57:19,530
MATT: You're the first one to climb up. She just
lowered the rope, so you're finding your way up

3643
03:57:19,530 --> 03:57:20,633
now. You haven't even seen her yet.

3644
03:57:20,633 --> 03:57:22,074
LIAM: All right.

3645
03:57:22,074 --> 03:57:28,780
MATT: You notice all the ice on the walls shatters
and clinks to the ground. You can hear the sound

3646
03:57:28,780 --> 03:57:33,572
of a million little shards of ice clinking onto
the ground and you can see the walls almost seem

3647
03:57:33,572 --> 03:57:35,421
like they're moving or writhing slightly.

3648
03:57:35,421 --> 03:57:36,776
LAURA: Ugh. Can I shoot at her?

3649
03:57:36,776 --> 03:57:37,951
MATT: If you'd like to, yeah.

3650
03:57:37,951 --> 03:57:38,895
LAURA: I want to.

3651
03:57:38,895 --> 03:57:39,740
MATT: Okay.

3652
03:57:39,740 --> 03:57:40,622
LAURA: Okay.

3653
03:57:40,622 --> 03:57:41,855
TRAVIS: Percy, get up the fucking rope.

3654
03:57:41,855 --> 03:57:43,378
TALIESIN: I'm heading straight up there.

3655
03:57:43,378 --> 03:57:45,603
MATT: What's your range increment for your
longbow?

3656
03:57:45,657 --> 03:57:47,334
LAURA: I don't see it.

3657
03:57:47,334 --> 03:57:50,240
MATT: I'll look it up under the equipment section
in the book.

3658
03:57:50,240 --> 03:57:51,768
LAURA: It doesn't say on the--

3659
03:57:51,768 --> 03:57:55,806
LIAM: I'm going to start throwing as soon as I'm
near my sister.

3660
03:57:55,806 --> 03:57:58,080
SAM: Oh, Vax. Hi.

3661
03:57:58,080 --> 03:57:59,063
LIAM: Hi.

3662
03:57:59,063 --> 03:58:00,437
LAURA: You can't throw 80 feet.

3663
03:58:00,437 --> 03:58:01,656
LIAM: No, but I could get closer.

3664
03:58:01,656 --> 03:58:04,066
LAURA: No, you can't. We're on the roof around
it.

3665
03:58:04,066 --> 03:58:08,243
TRAVIS: A real man could throw 80 feet.

3666
03:58:08,243 --> 03:58:11,387
LIAM: That's true, Grog. That's true. That's a
good point.

3667
03:58:11,387 --> 03:58:12,912
LAURA: I feel like it's 120 feet.

3668
03:58:12,912 --> 03:58:18,940
MATT: It's 150 feet, so yeah. There's no serious
issue there. You can go ahead. You have

3669
03:58:18,940 --> 03:58:20,079
disadvantage on the strike.

3670
03:58:20,079 --> 03:58:20,967
LAURA: Oh, I do?

3671
03:58:20,967 --> 03:58:23,920
MATT: Because her image is still shimmering.

3672
03:58:23,920 --> 03:58:25,866
LAURA: That's great, then 13.

3673
03:58:25,931 --> 03:58:27,823
MATT: 13. Arrow (whoosh) disappears into the
darkness.

3674
03:58:27,823 --> 03:58:29,035
LAURA: Can I hit her again?

3675
03:58:29,035 --> 03:58:30,119
MATT: Go for it.

3676
03:58:30,119 --> 03:58:34,727
LIAM: What is the relationship to her, if I've
just gotten next to her?

3677
03:58:34,727 --> 03:58:36,978
SAM: She was married to Sylas.

3678
03:58:36,978 --> 03:58:39,763
LIAM: No, shut up, you. Where are we, and where is
she?

3679
03:58:39,763 --> 03:58:43,828
MATT: Okay, so if you want to come up to the top
and start looking.

3680
03:58:43,828 --> 03:58:48,351
SAM: Oh god! That looks like a big hand.

3681
03:58:48,351 --> 03:58:49,974
LAURA: It's a Bigby Hand!

3682
03:58:49,974 --> 03:58:53,951
SAM: You know what they say about guys with Bigby
Hands?

3683
03:58:53,951 --> 03:58:56,959
MARISHA: Bigby Gloves?

3684
03:58:56,959 --> 03:58:59,282
LAURA: 20 was the second arrow that I shot at
her.

3685
03:58:59,282 --> 03:59:02,286
MATT: 20? 20 would hit.

3686
03:59:02,286 --> 03:59:09,635
TRAVIS: Percy, are you up there yet?

3687
03:59:09,635 --> 03:59:14,210
LIAM: Are we on the edge of a ledge or a wall?

3688
03:59:14,210 --> 03:59:19,251
MATT: There's a ledge that goes around the entire
wall that encases this, but there's no roof. It's

3689
03:59:19,251 --> 03:59:25,400
just an open square area. So you would get up to
there.

3690
03:59:25,400 --> 03:59:27,038
MARISHA: Can I go up next?

3691
03:59:27,038 --> 03:59:30,059
LAURA: Can I maybe go through the piece of paper
that she's reading?

3692
03:59:30,059 --> 03:59:35,649
MATT: That would've been something to call before
you shot her. Next attack you can, if you want.

3693
03:59:35,649 --> 03:59:38,086
LIAM: So you said Jennifer Lopez is 80 feet from
us?

3694
03:59:38,086 --> 03:59:41,420
MATT: Roughly, yeah.

3695
03:59:41,420 --> 03:59:43,449
TALIESIN: I head up, as well.

3696
03:59:43,449 --> 03:59:46,804
LAURA: 19 damage to her is what I rolled.

3697
03:59:46,804 --> 03:59:54,791
MATT: 19 damage? Okay. Strikes her. The arrow hits
and gleans off her. The damage, much like Percy's,

3698
03:59:54,791 --> 03:59:59,109
is not quite having the full damage you want it
to.

3699
03:59:59,109 --> 04:00:04,910
However, as that hits, she reaches into her
pocket and pulls something out. Percy, you get to

3700
04:00:04,962 --> 04:00:07,987
the top there. Who's up next?

3701
04:00:07,987 --> 04:00:09,237
MARISHA: I'll go.

3702
04:00:09,237 --> 04:00:10,383
ASHLEY: I'll go.

3703
04:00:10,383 --> 04:00:12,719
SAM: I'm always behind Pike.

3704
04:00:12,719 --> 04:00:17,744
MATT: All right, the rest of you gather at the
bottom here. Trinket's going to have a hard time

3705
04:00:17,744 --> 04:00:18,721
getting up there.

3706
04:00:18,721 --> 04:00:20,555
TALIESIN: I'm going to take 80 feet--

3707
04:00:20,555 --> 04:00:24,279
MATT: Well, before that happens, as a reaction to
that, she pulls something out of her hand. There's

3708
04:00:24,347 --> 04:00:29,187
a streak of red light that arcs upward, and
there's a slight shrieking sound as a familiar

3709
04:00:29,187 --> 04:00:36,008
arcane blast hits, a Fireball bursts on the
roof area around all of you. (explosion noise) I

3710
04:00:36,078 --> 04:00:38,742
need a dexterity saving throw from all three of
you guys up there.

3711
04:00:38,742 --> 04:00:43,484
MARISHA: Who's up there right now?

3712
04:00:43,536 --> 04:00:45,299
LAURA: Do we get advantage on it at all?

3713
04:00:45,299 --> 04:00:46,585
MATT: Nope.

3714
04:00:46,585 --> 04:00:51,245
LIAM: 15. Can I use Uncanny Dodge at this moment?

3715
04:00:51,245 --> 04:00:55,867
MATT: You mean to lower that damage by half?

3716
04:00:55,867 --> 04:00:56,595
LIAM: Yeah.

3717
04:00:56,595 --> 04:00:57,645
MATT: You can, yeah.

3718
04:00:57,645 --> 04:00:59,294
LIAM: What, is she casting a spell?

3719
04:00:59,294 --> 04:01:00,188
MATT: Yeah.

3720
04:01:00,188 --> 04:01:03,558
LIAM: I can also use Evasion.

3721
04:01:03,640 --> 04:01:04,761
MATT: You failed the save.

3722
04:01:04,761 --> 04:01:12,747
LIAM: Right, but depending on what it is. Those
both do different things. Okay, they do the same

3723
04:01:12,747 --> 04:01:13,821
thing. Sorry.

3724
04:01:13,821 --> 04:01:16,654
MATT: It's okay. All right, so saving throws for
Percy?

3725
04:01:16,654 --> 04:01:17,735
TALIESIN: 25.

3726
04:01:17,735 --> 04:01:19,775
MATT: 25 for your dex?

3727
04:01:19,775 --> 04:01:20,817
TALIESIN: I rolled a 19.

3728
04:01:20,817 --> 04:01:21,774
MATT: That's great.

3729
04:01:21,774 --> 04:01:22,615
LAURA: 16.

3730
04:01:22,615 --> 04:01:23,475
MATT: 16.

3731
04:01:23,475 --> 04:01:26,579
LIAM: It was a 15, so half damage.

3732
04:01:26,579 --> 04:01:37,356
MATT: All right, so you take half damage. That is
36 points of fire damage to you. That would be 18

3733
04:01:37,356 --> 04:01:44,942
to both of you guys. 18 points of fire damage.

3734
04:01:44,942 --> 04:01:48,146
LAURA: Another 18 points of fire damage?

3735
04:01:48,146 --> 04:01:50,599
MATT: No, just to them. You took full damage.

3736
04:01:50,599 --> 04:01:51,558
LAURA: Oh, okay.

3737
04:01:51,558 --> 04:01:53,701
MATT: Okay, next person at the rope?

3738
04:01:53,701 --> 04:01:54,820
MARISHA: Me.

3739
04:01:54,820 --> 04:01:56,521
MATT: All right. Keyleth, you make your way up to
the top.

3740
04:01:56,521 --> 04:01:57,902
TALIESIN: Can I fire now?

3741
04:01:57,902 --> 04:01:59,274
MATT: Yeah.

3742
04:01:59,274 --> 04:02:07,881
TALIESIN: It's 80 feet? It's within the Pepperbox
range. I'm going to shoot

3743
04:02:07,881 --> 04:02:10,460
for the scroll with fire.

3744
04:02:10,460 --> 04:02:12,173
MATT: Okay.

3745
04:02:12,173 --> 04:02:18,005
MARISHA: Yeah, good call.

3746
04:02:18,005 --> 04:02:22,906
TALIESIN: That rolled really low. I can use that
bonus die. I rolled within my--

3747
04:02:22,906 --> 04:02:25,933
MATT: Misfire?

3748
04:02:25,933 --> 04:02:27,563
TALIESIN: Can I use the--

3749
04:02:27,563 --> 04:02:29,704
MATT: The natural roll is still what counts for
misfire, unfortunately.

3750
04:02:29,704 --> 04:02:32,526
LAURA: Oh no.

3751
04:02:32,526 --> 04:02:35,762
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and fix it.

3752
04:02:35,762 --> 04:02:36,848
MATT: Okay.

3753
04:02:36,848 --> 04:02:41,347
TALIESIN: No.

3754
04:02:41,347 --> 04:02:43,522
MATT: Pepperbox is broken.

3755
04:02:43,522 --> 04:02:49,248
LAURA: Have I recovered at all to shoot again?
Have I recovered enough to shoot at her again?

3756
04:02:49,248 --> 04:02:50,568
MATT: You will in a second.

3757
04:02:50,568 --> 04:02:53,490
TALIESIN: Pepperbox is completely broken.

3758
04:02:53,490 --> 04:02:55,213
MATT: Yeah, unusable.

3759
04:02:55,213 --> 04:02:57,053
SAM: Oh no, if only we had another gun.

3760
04:02:57,053 --> 04:02:57,954
LAURA: I know.

3761
04:02:57,954 --> 04:02:59,382
SAM: Oh, wait. We do.

3762
04:02:59,382 --> 04:03:00,385
LAURA: Bad News.

3763
04:03:00,385 --> 04:03:01,681
SAM: No, we have another gun.

3764
04:03:01,681 --> 04:03:02,557
TALIESIN: We have two more guns.

3765
04:03:02,557 --> 04:03:04,430
MARISHA: We have Ripley's gun.

3766
04:03:04,430 --> 04:03:05,456
SAM: Give it to me.

3767
04:03:05,456 --> 04:03:06,472
LAURA: Are you up on top?

3768
04:03:06,472 --> 04:03:07,289
SAM: No.

3769
04:03:07,289 --> 04:03:08,480
LAURA: I can't give it to you.

3770
04:03:08,480 --> 04:03:10,969
TALIESIN: Do I still have-- are we still--

3771
04:03:10,969 --> 04:03:12,682
MATT: You have one more attack.

3772
04:03:12,682 --> 04:03:14,218
TALIESIN: Bad News.

3773
04:03:14,218 --> 04:03:19,245
MATT: You'll get Bad News out. That's it. All
right, with that--

3774
04:03:19,245 --> 04:03:20,513
LIAM: Matthew.

3775
04:03:20,513 --> 04:03:21,606
MATT: Yes?

3776
04:03:21,606 --> 04:03:23,496
LIAM: You're very good at this.

3777
04:03:23,496 --> 04:03:24,903
MATT: What do you want to do?

3778
04:03:24,903 --> 04:03:26,847
LIAM: That's it. I just want to say you're very
good at this.

3779
04:03:26,847 --> 04:03:33,066
MATT: (giggles, sighs) We're running a little
late. Trying to get through this climactic moment,

3780
04:03:33,155 --> 04:03:34,299
guys. Apologies.

3781
04:03:34,299 --> 04:03:35,683
MARISHA: Are we running late?

3782
04:03:35,683 --> 04:03:36,764
TALIESIN: Don't look.

3783
04:03:36,764 --> 04:03:37,703
MARISHA: It's fine.

3784
04:03:37,703 --> 04:03:39,046
MATT: Sorry, guys.

3785
04:03:39,046 --> 04:03:41,641
MARISHA: Crew hates us.

3786
04:03:41,641 --> 04:03:48,058
MATT: I know. It's okay. I'll make it up to them.
At this point, the scroll (fluttering noise)

3787
04:03:48,058 --> 04:04:01,402
vanishes. She, as a bonus action at the top of
this turn, gashes across her wrist and spreads her

3788
04:04:01,402 --> 04:04:06,180
own life's blood across what looks to be this dark
orb, about a foot in diameter, that's resting in

3789
04:04:06,180 --> 04:04:08,185
the center of this upper platform.

3790
04:04:08,185 --> 04:04:09,957
LAURA: Can I take a potion really fast?

3791
04:04:09,957 --> 04:04:12,691
MATT: At the top of your turn, you can, as a bonus
action.

3792
04:04:12,691 --> 04:04:15,447
MARISHA: The orb is floating?

3793
04:04:15,447 --> 04:04:18,936
MATT: The dark orb in the center of the platform
that she's currently on in the center of this

3794
04:04:18,936 --> 04:04:23,760
room. It's half-embedded in the ground, and she
scatters her blood across it. You can see her

3795
04:04:23,760 --> 04:04:26,682
shaking with fear and trepidation during this
whole circumstance.

3796
04:04:26,682 --> 04:04:30,980
MARISHA: She splatters her blood on the dark
sphere?

3797
04:04:30,980 --> 04:04:34,326
MATT: Make a perception check, those who are up
top, by the way. Who's up next?

3798
04:04:34,326 --> 04:04:37,293
TALIESIN: Jesus Christ. 16.

3799
04:04:37,293 --> 04:04:39,816
MARISHA: One.

3800
04:04:39,816 --> 04:04:40,793
LAURA: What are we trying to do?

3801
04:04:40,793 --> 04:04:42,640
MATT: Perception. Scanlan gets up.

3802
04:04:42,640 --> 04:04:45,088
SAM: Hey. Hi, guys! What's going-- oh.

3803
04:04:45,088 --> 04:04:46,440
LIAM: 20.

3804
04:04:46,440 --> 04:04:48,043
SAM: She's bleeding all over that thing?

3805
04:04:48,043 --> 04:04:55,151
MATT: Those who got 15 or higher, you notice the
writhing on the walls. The walls are encased in

3806
04:04:55,151 --> 04:05:03,247
what looks like a tapestry of bodies. Hundreds of
humanoid individuals that are woven into each

3807
04:05:03,247 --> 04:05:09,575
other, each missing their left hand and/or left
eye from their body, and they're all just

3808
04:05:09,575 --> 04:05:15,566
squirming and writhing. Many of them are in
various states of decay, and they're just moving

3809
04:05:15,566 --> 04:05:21,395
after that ice that was encasing them had
shattered. There's a low, weird moaning drone

3810
04:05:21,395 --> 04:05:27,139
that's beginning to fill the room. The black orb
itself is starting to rise out of the center of

3811
04:05:27,225 --> 04:05:28,957
the pedestal, as well.

3812
04:05:28,957 --> 04:05:36,269
Now, Vex, since you had the top of this, and Vax.
What do you want to do?

3813
04:05:36,269 --> 04:05:40,847
LIAM: Wait, there's an orb coming up from where?

3814
04:05:40,847 --> 04:05:42,455
TRAVIS: The center of the pedestal.

3815
04:05:42,455 --> 04:05:43,922
MATT: The center of the platform she's on.

3816
04:05:43,922 --> 04:05:45,587
SAM: She's got blood on it. She's doing a magic
ritual.

3817
04:05:45,587 --> 04:05:47,859
LIAM: And we're how high in the air from the floor
that she's on?

3818
04:05:47,859 --> 04:05:51,762
MATT: I'd say you're about 30 feet up. She's about
40 feet up. She's actually risen a little above

3819
04:05:51,762 --> 04:05:52,686
you guys.

3820
04:05:52,686 --> 04:05:56,415
LAURA: I'm going to guzzle a potion, and then I'm
going to shoot Percy's special arrow, question

3821
04:05:56,415 --> 04:05:58,072
mark? At the orb.

3822
04:05:58,072 --> 04:06:04,079
SAM: At the orb? You're not going to stop this
with an arrow. It's happened already. It's done.

3823
04:06:04,079 --> 04:06:08,410
LIAM: If I go to the very edge, how far am I from
her?

3824
04:06:08,410 --> 04:06:13,726
LAURA: Then what am I supposed to do? Killing her,
what good will it do?

3825
04:06:13,726 --> 04:06:15,103
MATT: 55 feet away.

3826
04:06:15,103 --> 04:06:17,039
LAURA: Maybe she's a sacrifice, at this point.

3827
04:06:17,039 --> 04:06:18,666
LIAM: That's within range, right?

3828
04:06:18,666 --> 04:06:19,913
MATT: Of your daggers?

3829
04:06:19,913 --> 04:06:22,251
LIAM: Yeah. I'm throwing, then, at her.

3830
04:06:22,251 --> 04:06:23,876
MATT: What's the throwing dagger range?

3831
04:06:23,876 --> 04:06:28,317
LIAM: 60 feet, because I'm sharpshooter, so I take
no disadvantage.

3832
04:06:28,317 --> 04:06:31,092
MATT: Then...

3833
04:06:31,092 --> 04:06:34,460
LIAM: Yeah, I don't like her.

3834
04:06:34,460 --> 04:06:36,419
MATT: 20/60, so yeah, you can still hit her.

3835
04:06:36,419 --> 04:06:40,405
LIAM: Yeah, so I'm going to throw two daggers at
her. I don't know if there's any poison left-- I'm

3836
04:06:40,405 --> 04:06:48,837
sure there's not-- on the Life-Stealing, and the
Keen. First one is not good at all. That's a 14,

3837
04:06:48,837 --> 04:07:02,663
and the second one hits. That's a 28. That is the
Life-Stealing. That is seven points of damage.

3838
04:07:02,743 --> 04:07:07,510
MATT: Okay. All right. Vex?

3839
04:07:07,510 --> 04:07:09,608
LAURA: I had said I was going to shoot the orb.

3840
04:07:09,608 --> 04:07:11,280
MATT: Go for it.

3841
04:07:11,280 --> 04:07:14,135
LAURA: All right. I'm going to shoot the special
arrow, question mark.

3842
04:07:14,135 --> 04:07:17,792
TRAVIS: Plus, you're left-handed, and she
apparently has things against lefties.

3843
04:07:17,792 --> 04:07:19,117
LAURA: Yeah, exactly.

3844
04:07:19,117 --> 04:07:20,902
LIAM: You flicked me in the left nut. Are you
complicit?

3845
04:07:20,902 --> 04:07:22,903
TRAVIS: You don't know.

3846
04:07:22,903 --> 04:07:25,956
LAURA: 23?

3847
04:07:26,020 --> 04:07:30,331
MATT: 23? Okay. That does hit the orb. Roll
damage.

3848
04:07:30,331 --> 04:07:35,353
LAURA: I don't know what I'm doing!

3849
04:07:35,353 --> 04:07:37,547
LIAM: Let's see what happens.

3850
04:07:37,547 --> 04:07:38,816
LAURA: 15?

3851
04:07:38,816 --> 04:07:43,104
MATT: Okay, the arrow streaks off and seemingly
hits the orb. Splinters across the surface.

3852
04:07:43,104 --> 04:07:46,468
TALIESIN: It was the arrow, question mark.

3853
04:07:46,468 --> 04:07:59,158
MATT: Oh, it was the explosive one? Oh, okay. The
arrow arcs off. Did you roll with disadvantage on

3854
04:07:59,241 --> 04:08:01,388
that one because it is the explosive arrow?

3855
04:08:01,388 --> 04:08:07,875
LAURA: Oh shit. No. 15.

3856
04:08:07,875 --> 04:08:14,250
MATT: 15. The arrow whizzes past and slams into
the bottom of the pillar. You see a muffled

3857
04:08:14,250 --> 04:08:20,205
explosion and light flash, and it rocks the center
a bit, but she still maintains concentration. She

3858
04:08:20,205 --> 04:08:22,137
looks over at where it came from.

3859
04:08:22,137 --> 04:08:25,490
LAURA: Should I have shot her? I'm sorry. I should
have shot her!

3860
04:08:25,490 --> 04:08:28,137
SAM: It's fine. It wouldn't have done anything.

3861
04:08:28,137 --> 04:08:33,127
MARISHA: Can I try something? Am I able to try
something? Is she still bleeding

3862
04:08:33,127 --> 04:08:34,420
all over this orb?

3863
04:08:34,420 --> 04:08:39,344
MATT: The bleeding has finished. The orb is rising
up and pulsing.

3864
04:08:39,344 --> 04:08:40,486
LIAM: Question.

3865
04:08:40,486 --> 04:08:41,428
MATT: Yes.

3866
04:08:41,428 --> 04:08:42,465
LIAM: Did we surprise her?

3867
04:08:42,465 --> 04:08:44,668
MATT: No, she is well aware of you guys.

3868
04:08:44,668 --> 04:08:49,455
LIAM: She's well aware that we're here. Did I go
before her? Is there initiative here? Did I go

3869
04:08:49,455 --> 04:08:50,497
before her turn?

3870
04:08:50,497 --> 04:08:53,050
MATT: Right now, as people arrive, I'm
counting this. I'll probably do initiative after

3871
04:08:53,050 --> 04:08:55,082
we finish this set.

3872
04:08:55,153 --> 04:08:56,394
LAURA: Can I still fly?

3873
04:08:56,394 --> 04:08:59,006
MATT: You can still fly if you want, yeah.

3874
04:08:59,006 --> 04:09:00,380
SAM: How far?

3875
04:09:00,380 --> 04:09:01,489
MATT: 55 feet.

3876
04:09:01,489 --> 04:09:04,818
SAM: Am I going soon?

3877
04:09:04,818 --> 04:09:06,151
MATT: We're getting to that now.

3878
04:09:06,151 --> 04:09:09,210
LIAM: I think this is going to be shot down, and
I'm fine if it is, but I know that with

3879
04:09:09,210 --> 04:09:13,416
Assassinate, if I go before the enemy does, it's
an automatic critical.

3880
04:09:13,416 --> 04:09:21,523
MATT: This is one of those circumstances where you
guys have been already in combat. This isn't a

3881
04:09:21,530 --> 04:09:25,644
scenario where you got the jump on them. She's
aware that you guys are there and she's just

3882
04:09:25,644 --> 04:09:27,581
trying to finish this while ignoring that
circumstance.

3883
04:09:27,581 --> 04:09:32,075
LAURA: I'm going to pull out a fancy robe from my
bag and I'm going to try to fly towards the orb.

3884
04:09:32,075 --> 04:09:33,306
MATT: Okay.

3885
04:09:33,306 --> 04:09:34,684
MARISHA: While she does that--

3886
04:09:34,684 --> 04:09:38,066
TALIESIN: Keyleth's got shit.

3887
04:09:38,066 --> 04:09:40,362
MARISHA: It's not going to work, but I can try.

3888
04:09:40,362 --> 04:09:42,614
MATT: All right, you three.

3889
04:09:42,614 --> 04:09:52,419
MARISHA: Okay, so you could argue that our bodies
are made of 70 percent water, right, so if I cast

3890
04:09:52,419 --> 04:09:56,584
Control Water, can I move her blood?

3891
04:09:56,584 --> 04:10:06,925
MATT: You can certainly try. Her blood has already
cast across the orb and it seems to have initiated

3892
04:10:06,925 --> 04:10:12,421
whatever is part of it. There's not still blood
pouring onto it; she scattered across it once.

3893
04:10:12,421 --> 04:10:16,322
MARISHA: So wiping the blood off probably wouldn't
work?

3894
04:10:16,322 --> 04:10:17,453
MATT: You can try.

3895
04:10:17,453 --> 04:10:18,836
TRAVIS: Let's say no.

3896
04:10:18,836 --> 04:10:22,176
LIAM: If she rolls really high. Really high.

3897
04:10:22,176 --> 04:10:24,952
TALIESIN: How good do you feel about a natural
20?

3898
04:10:24,952 --> 04:10:30,198
MARISHA: "How good do you feel about a natural
20?" Well, judging by the shit that's been going

3899
04:10:30,198 --> 04:10:36,338
down today-- fuck it! I already said it. I'm going
to do it. I'm going to do Control Water and I'm

3900
04:10:36,338 --> 04:10:40,574
going to see if I can suck all the blood off of
the orb.

3901
04:10:40,574 --> 04:10:45,379
MATT: Okay. Roll a d20, add your wisdom modifier.

3902
04:10:45,379 --> 04:10:48,422
MARISHA: Okay. Oh, did you see that?

3903
04:10:48,422 --> 04:10:51,547
TALIESIN: I did. That was cruel.

3904
04:10:51,547 --> 04:10:53,153
MARISHA: It was on a 20.

3905
04:10:53,153 --> 04:10:54,306
TALIESIN: And then it bounced.

3906
04:10:54,306 --> 04:10:56,596
MARISHA: 15.

3907
04:10:56,596 --> 04:11:03,600
MATT: Okay. Focusing from this distance, you try
to-- The blood shifts across the surface, but there

3908
04:11:03,600 --> 04:11:09,333
is some sort of power that's holding it to the
orb. It is unmoved. I know. Scanlan?

3909
04:11:09,333 --> 04:11:11,457
SAM: I've got one shot at this, right?

3910
04:11:11,457 --> 04:11:12,623
LIAM: Yes.

3911
04:11:12,623 --> 04:11:18,258
SAM: I'm going to try to cast-- I can't cast
anything anymore. I'm going to try to cast

3912
04:11:18,258 --> 04:11:28,207
Suggestion on her, and I will say, 
Stop, collaborate and listen. Because I'm a gnome

3913
04:11:28,421 --> 04:11:35,426
who's on a mission. Follow me as I kill your
husband the lich, and I'll make you my bitch.

3914
04:11:35,426 --> 04:11:37,625
TRAVIS: Her husband was a vampire.

3915
04:11:37,625 --> 04:11:39,025
SAM: Oh, yeah. Whatever.

3916
04:11:39,025 --> 04:11:40,224
MATT: It didn't rhyme. It's fine.

3917
04:11:40,224 --> 04:11:44,616
LIAM: Come on. Hail Mary pass, here we go.

3918
04:11:44,616 --> 04:11:48,183
MATT: Okay.

3919
04:11:48,183 --> 04:11:56,905
SAM: Suggestion is a-- oh, she probably can't be
charmed. It's a wisdom saving throw.

3920
04:11:56,905 --> 04:12:00,184
MATT: Okay, she rolled a 19. What's your DC on
that?

3921
04:12:00,184 --> 04:12:01,435
SAM: 19.

3922
04:12:01,435 --> 04:12:03,078
MATT: 19. Yeah, with the cone.

3923
04:12:03,078 --> 04:12:04,666
(groaning)

3924
04:12:04,666 --> 04:12:06,264
LIAM: Good attempt, though, Sam.

3925
04:12:06,264 --> 04:12:09,191
SAM: Never mind! Carry on!

3926
04:12:09,191 --> 04:12:10,199
MATT: Percy?

3927
04:12:10,199 --> 04:12:19,602
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a shot with Bad News
because this is getting really ridiculous. I'm

3928
04:12:19,602 --> 04:12:28,632
going to try and get her attention and get her to
pay attention. Let's have a normal roll. Oh, for

3929
04:12:28,632 --> 04:12:30,561
the love of God!

3930
04:12:30,561 --> 04:12:31,709
MARISHA: No.

3931
04:12:31,709 --> 04:12:33,099
LIAM: One? 20?

3932
04:12:33,099 --> 04:12:34,511
TALIESIN: So, Bad News--

3933
04:12:34,511 --> 04:12:37,299
LAURA: Misfire?

3934
04:12:37,299 --> 04:12:39,107
MATT: All right, try and repair it.

3935
04:12:39,107 --> 04:12:41,854
TALIESIN: Just barely!

3936
04:12:41,854 --> 04:12:42,979
MATT: Okay.

3937
04:12:42,979 --> 04:12:53,526
TALIESIN: And I can try and get one more bullet to
come out of it at this point, so I'm going to make

3938
04:12:53,526 --> 04:13:02,010
one last attempt to make it shoot, after clearing
the chamber. Better! Jesus H. Christ. 24.

3939
04:13:02,010 --> 04:13:03,210
MATT: That'll hit.

3940
04:13:03,210 --> 04:13:06,429
LIAM: Come on. Coup de grace.

3941
04:13:06,429 --> 04:13:09,069
MARISHA: Coup de grace.

3942
04:13:09,069 --> 04:13:13,841
TALIESIN: This is at least going to get her
attention.

3943
04:13:13,841 --> 04:13:24,747
MARISHA: At least distract her. Come on, Percy.
That was a 12 on a d12, which is dope.

3944
04:13:24,747 --> 04:13:28,737
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's 21. 27 points of damage.

3945
04:13:28,737 --> 04:13:34,512
MATT: Okay. So the (gunshot noise) blast from Bad
News scatters through the air and slams into her

3946
04:13:34,512 --> 04:13:37,962
side, and she's nearly thrown off the top of the
platform from the blast of it. You can see blood

3947
04:13:37,962 --> 04:13:42,516
streaking down her other arm now, and she has
blood down the side of her face, down one arm and

3948
04:13:42,516 --> 04:13:47,743
the other, and she's shaking in place on the
platform. She sees you lifting towards, holding

3949
04:13:47,743 --> 04:13:52,300
the robe to the side, and she's looking at the
orb, and doesn't even seem to really know what's

3950
04:13:52,362 --> 04:13:56,232
going to happen. There's this anticipation and
fear in her eyes. Everything's been torn from her,

3951
04:13:56,232 --> 04:13:58,852
at this point. She's a caged animal with nothing
to lose.

3952
04:13:58,852 --> 04:14:07,939
That finishes your turn. Taking her turn, she sees
you rushing towards her. She extends her finger--

3953
04:14:07,939 --> 04:14:11,014
LAURA: Oh, wait! I took a potion. I took a potion!
I said it on the last turn, and I didn't use it.

3954
04:14:11,014 --> 04:14:12,709
MATT: What did you roll?

3955
04:14:12,709 --> 04:14:17,042
LAURA: I don't know how much to roll for a greater
healing potion. That's why I didn't do it.

3956
04:14:17,042 --> 04:14:20,588
MATT: That is 4d4 plus four.

3957
04:14:20,588 --> 04:14:25,184
LAURA: (whispering) I'm going to die.

3958
04:14:25,184 --> 04:14:26,391
LIAM: No. No.

3959
04:14:26,391 --> 04:14:28,588
LAURA: No, I'm serious. I'm going to die right
now.

3960
04:14:28,588 --> 04:14:32,777
LIAM: No! Shut up. Four and-- pretty good.

3961
04:14:32,777 --> 04:14:41,608
LAURA: Okay.

3962
04:14:41,608 --> 04:14:42,940
LIAM: That's good.

3963
04:14:42,940 --> 04:14:44,715
MATT: What are you at?

3964
04:14:44,715 --> 04:14:46,017
LAURA: 76.

3965
04:14:46,017 --> 04:14:52,867
MATT: Okay. She extends her finger towards you
with a look, and there's this point of

3966
04:14:52,867 --> 04:14:55,008
recognition, this moment, where you're like--

3967
04:14:55,008 --> 04:14:56,617
LAURA: I know that.

3968
04:14:56,617 --> 04:15:00,313
MATT: I need you to make a constitution saving
throw.

3969
04:15:00,313 --> 04:15:04,104
SAM: There's no attack, there's no nothing?
There's no roll? I can't Cutting Words this?

3970
04:15:04,104 --> 04:15:05,213
MATT: Nope.

3971
04:15:05,213 --> 04:15:07,706
SAM: I can't Cutting Words?

3972
04:15:07,706 --> 04:15:08,729
MATT: Yep.

3973
04:15:08,729 --> 04:15:11,774
SAM: I can't Cutting Words the damage?

3974
04:15:11,774 --> 04:15:15,438
MATT: It's not a weapon attack, unfortunately.

3975
04:15:15,438 --> 04:15:16,592
SAM: Damn it.

3976
04:15:16,592 --> 04:15:18,119
LAURA: 11.

3977
04:15:18,119 --> 04:15:19,977
MATT: Nope.

3978
04:15:19,977 --> 04:15:22,703
LAURA: Wait, 13.

3979
04:15:22,703 --> 04:15:25,967
MATT: 13, no. All right, so--

3980
04:15:25,967 --> 04:15:29,732
SAM: This is it. This is it.

3981
04:15:29,732 --> 04:15:44,149
MARISHA: No.

3982
04:15:44,219 --> 04:15:48,970
MATT: 45 plus 30. 75 points of necrotic damage.

3983
04:15:49,039 --> 04:15:51,902
MARISHA: But you were at 76?

3984
04:15:51,902 --> 04:15:58,583
TALIESIN, MARISHA, and SAM: Oh my god.

3985
04:15:58,583 --> 04:16:06,021
MATT: All righty. You're at one hit point. As your
life force is suddenly sucked out of your body and

3986
04:16:06,110 --> 04:16:12,035
you manage to capture what essence of your
existence still holds you aloft. Drifting forward,

3987
04:16:12,035 --> 04:16:14,994
almost toppling over in your Fly spell.

3988
04:16:14,994 --> 04:16:24,672
At this point, she looks at her finger,
frustrated. Glances at the rest of you, and looks

3989
04:16:24,672 --> 04:16:30,138
forward at the orb and goes, "Come on, come on!"
At this point, the orb is now shimmering, and the

3990
04:16:30,138 --> 04:16:37,706
blood is slowly spilling over the outside of the
dark onyx sphere. It begins to spin

3991
04:16:37,706 --> 04:16:39,995
and spin and spin.

3992
04:16:39,995 --> 04:16:41,778
LAURA: Am I close to it?

3993
04:16:41,778 --> 04:16:51,466
MATT: You've moved up to this point. Now you're
right at the edge. The orb suddenly shrinks in a

3994
04:16:51,466 --> 04:16:59,835
flash of an instant, becoming this tiny speck,
this little dark speck in the air, roughly the

3995
04:16:59,835 --> 04:17:16,324
size of a dime. And that's it. She waits. "No, no,
no, no! It can't be too soon. Please! Please." And

3996
04:17:16,324 --> 04:17:23,582
she falls to her knees. She's staring at this dark
speck in the air. The writhing walls of the room

3997
04:17:23,582 --> 04:17:37,402
fall quiet again, all the bodies no longer moving.
You, floating through the air? Your flight ends.

3998
04:17:37,402 --> 04:17:39,811
You immediately plummet.

3999
04:17:39,811 --> 04:17:43,209
MARISHA: Can I cast Hold Person? On her?

4000
04:17:43,209 --> 04:17:44,724
SAM: On her?

4001
04:17:44,724 --> 04:17:45,771
MARISHA: Yes!

4002
04:17:45,771 --> 04:17:47,534
MATT: If you want to. It's just going to paralyze
her.

4003
04:17:47,534 --> 04:17:49,046
MARISHA: Oh, I can't hold her?

4004
04:17:49,046 --> 04:18:00,380
MATT: No. So at that height, it's 40 feet. You
fall. You take 3d6 points of damage.

4005
04:18:00,380 --> 04:18:05,188
LAURA: Can I roll for acrobatics? Maybe I can
catch myself.

4006
04:18:05,188 --> 04:18:09,258
MATT: You know what? Roll acrobatics with
disadvantage.

4007
04:18:09,258 --> 04:18:14,104
LAURA: Okay. I don't know where a d20 is.

4008
04:18:14,104 --> 04:18:21,138
LIAM: 20, and? Six.

4009
04:18:21,138 --> 04:18:24,797
LAURA: Acrobatics?

4010
04:18:24,797 --> 04:18:28,151
LIAM and LAURA: 15.

4011
04:18:28,151 --> 04:18:34,392
MATT: You take four points of fall damage. As you
slam down into the center of this.

4012
04:18:34,392 --> 04:18:36,475
LAURA: And I'm unconscious.

4013
04:18:36,475 --> 04:18:38,560
MATT: You're unconscious on the ground. (thud)

4014
04:18:38,560 --> 04:18:41,451
LAURA: That's my first time I've ever been
unconscious.

4015
04:18:41,451 --> 04:18:42,980
MARISHA: I thought you were going to die.

4016
04:18:42,980 --> 04:18:45,015
TALIESIN: She's still connected to her rope,
though, isn't she?

4017
04:18:45,015 --> 04:18:49,733
LAURA: No. I took out a fancy robe. I was going to
trap the globe.

4018
04:18:49,733 --> 04:18:50,987
LIAM: Whose turn is it?

4019
04:18:50,987 --> 04:18:53,452
ASHLEY: Can I get to her?

4020
04:18:53,452 --> 04:18:56,691
MATT: You guys are up on this roof right now.

4021
04:18:56,691 --> 04:19:00,379
LIAM: I'm leaping. If you let me leap, I'm going
to leap and take an acrobatics check.

4022
04:19:00,379 --> 04:19:02,021
MATT: Acrobatics check, go for it.

4023
04:19:02,021 --> 04:19:06,279
LIAM: 20. Natural fucking 20!

4024
04:19:06,279 --> 04:19:07,483
MATT: Landing on your feet.

4025
04:19:07,483 --> 04:19:08,728
TALIESIN: Parkour!

4026
04:19:08,728 --> 04:19:11,860
LIAM: I have a potion with my sister's name
written on it, and it's going in her mouth.

4027
04:19:11,860 --> 04:19:14,957
MATT: That's as far as you get on your movement,
right there.

4028
04:19:14,957 --> 04:19:16,277
LIAM: All right.

4029
04:19:16,277 --> 04:19:19,998
LAURA: All right. You can kill her!

4030
04:19:19,998 --> 04:19:21,638
MATT: So you rush up.

4031
04:19:21,638 --> 04:19:22,591
LIAM: I'm right there?

4032
04:19:22,591 --> 04:19:25,386
MATT: That's your full movement to get to her. You
can't do anything else.

4033
04:19:25,386 --> 04:19:27,477
LIAM: So I can't do anything else? I can't do a
bonus action? I can't do nothing.

4034
04:19:27,477 --> 04:19:31,325
MATT: Well, you can do a bonus action, but it's an
action to feed a potion to somebody else.

4035
04:19:31,325 --> 04:19:36,102
LIAM: Then I'm throwing a knife at Lady Briarwood,
which I can use a bonus action to attack her.

4036
04:19:36,102 --> 04:19:39,547
MATT: On the ground, you can't see her. She's 40
feet up on the platform. She's completely out of

4037
04:19:39,547 --> 04:19:45,600
your visual sight. You're down inside this hand
groove that's dug in the ground.

4038
04:19:45,600 --> 04:19:47,939
LIAM: Fuck. All right, I'll hold.

4039
04:19:47,939 --> 04:19:50,183
MATT: Who's up next? Who wants to go next?

4040
04:19:50,183 --> 04:19:51,869
MARISHA: Pike!

4041
04:19:51,869 --> 04:19:53,379
ASHLEY: Can I get to her?

4042
04:19:53,379 --> 04:19:57,654
MATT: You're on top of the roof. You're going to
have to leap down to get to her. You're too far

4043
04:19:57,654 --> 04:19:58,519
away.

4044
04:19:58,519 --> 04:19:59,916
LIAM: She's got time.

4045
04:19:59,916 --> 04:20:02,658
MATT: Actually, you could try a spell if you want
to.

4046
04:20:02,658 --> 04:20:04,167
ASHLEY: Say again?

4047
04:20:04,167 --> 04:20:08,738
MATT: You can try a spell if you want to. She's
about 50 feet from you, at an angle.

4048
04:20:08,738 --> 04:20:15,247
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll do a Healing Word.

4049
04:20:15,247 --> 04:20:26,433
MATT: Okay. As you pull up your holy symbol and
begin casting the spell, the divine energy seems

4050
04:20:26,433 --> 04:20:30,739
to be pulled from your hand, and the spell has no
effect.

4051
04:20:30,739 --> 04:20:32,871
SAM: So magic doesn't work?

4052
04:20:32,871 --> 04:20:35,694
MARISHA: Is it because we're in this fucking
room?

4053
04:20:35,694 --> 04:20:40,086
MATT: Do you want to stay where you are?

4054
04:20:40,086 --> 04:20:44,652
LIAM: Come on down. Let's party.

4055
04:20:44,652 --> 04:20:46,790
TRAVIS: I'll go next.

4056
04:20:46,790 --> 04:20:53,839
MATT: Grog, you've gotten up now, with the rope,
to the top. Anybody else want to go?

4057
04:20:53,839 --> 04:20:56,210
TALIESIN: I'll take a shot at Lady Briarwood,
since I'm up here.

4058
04:20:56,210 --> 04:20:59,919
MATT: Go for it. And you aren't forgetting your Hex
damage on her, right?

4059
04:20:59,919 --> 04:21:07,759
TALIESIN: I was. I forgot it on the last one. I
remembered that I forgot it. That's 24 to hit.

4060
04:21:07,759 --> 04:21:09,756
MATT: That hits.

4061
04:21:09,756 --> 04:21:19,636
TALIESIN: 13, 14, 15, 16-- 22 points of damage.

4062
04:21:19,636 --> 04:21:22,190
MATT: How do you want to do this?

4063
04:21:22,190 --> 04:21:24,352
SAM: You get to kill Lady Briarwood?

4064
04:21:24,352 --> 04:21:27,556
LAURA: Do it with as little blood as possible. I'm
dead.

4065
04:21:27,556 --> 04:21:29,670
MATT: You're unconscious.

4066
04:21:29,670 --> 04:21:31,454
LAURA: I'm unconscious.

4067
04:21:31,454 --> 04:21:33,830
TRAVIS: I think, if you kill her--

4068
04:21:33,830 --> 04:21:36,644
TALIESIN: It's a little late.

4069
04:21:36,644 --> 04:21:38,288
TRAVIS: Here comes Godzilla.

4070
04:21:38,288 --> 04:21:45,639
MATT: The smoke billowing from your body, the
essence of this creature whispering in your ear,

4071
04:21:45,639 --> 04:21:59,063
"Now. Do it. Do it!" Bad News, freshly repaired,
loaded.

4072
04:21:59,063 --> 04:22:12,962
SAM: It's your birthright.

4073
04:22:13,025 --> 04:22:22,194
TALIESIN: I'm going to take-- oh my god. I'm going
to take a shoulder shot on her right arm, and I'm

4074
04:22:22,290 --> 04:22:27,505
going to try to cleave her right arm right off
with the shot and see if I can leave her

4075
04:22:27,505 --> 04:22:29,133
unconscious.

4076
04:22:29,133 --> 04:22:37,621
MATT: Okay. Roll damage. This is going to be a
constitution saving throw for her, if she can

4077
04:22:37,670 --> 04:22:41,794
survive this wound as (gun blast)-- the right or
left arm, you said?

4078
04:22:41,794 --> 04:22:42,916
TALIESIN: Right arm.

4079
04:22:42,916 --> 04:22:48,830
MATT: Right arm. (gun blast) Blasts open, the bone
exposed. The arm spins off and clatters to the

4080
04:22:48,830 --> 04:22:57,794
ground behind her. With that blast, she falls
backward onto the steps behind the platform.

4081
04:22:57,794 --> 04:23:05,136
(impact noises) Falls off the steps, falls out of
sight behind the pillar. You don't even see where

4082
04:23:05,136 --> 04:23:07,623
she is. She falls out of visual range.

4083
04:23:07,623 --> 04:23:12,273
TRAVIS: We don't know if she's unconscious or
dead?

4084
04:23:12,273 --> 04:23:13,374
MATT: You don't know.

4085
04:23:13,374 --> 04:23:14,845
LIAM: I'm going to circle around to her right
now.

4086
04:23:14,845 --> 04:23:15,986
LAURA: You're not going to try to heal me?

4087
04:23:15,986 --> 04:23:17,538
LIAM: No, I know. Oh, shit.

4088
04:23:17,538 --> 04:23:18,560
LAURA: You're not going to heal me?

4089
04:23:18,560 --> 04:23:19,904
LIAM: Yes, I am. Fuck that.

4090
04:23:19,904 --> 04:23:21,329
TRAVIS: Can I jump down, then?

4091
04:23:21,329 --> 04:23:23,608
LIAM: I'm feeding a potion to my sister.

4092
04:23:23,608 --> 04:23:24,783
MATT: Acrobatics check?

4093
04:23:24,783 --> 04:23:27,663
LIAM: Thank you.

4094
04:23:27,663 --> 04:23:29,816
TRAVIS: 18.

4095
04:23:29,816 --> 04:23:43,158
MATT: 18, okay. You land and take ten points of
damage from the fall. All right.

4096
04:23:43,158 --> 04:23:50,799
LAURA: Trinket's at the door going, (sad bear
noises).

4097
04:23:50,799 --> 04:23:58,350
MATT: Trinket's trying to get in on this side. All
right, Percy's gone. Scanlan, do you want to try

4098
04:23:58,350 --> 04:23:59,591
anything?

4099
04:23:59,591 --> 04:24:06,016
SAM: I can move within 30 feet of Vax?

4100
04:24:06,016 --> 04:24:09,083
MATT: You'd have to get on the ground to do it.

4101
04:24:09,083 --> 04:24:10,517
SAM: All right.

4102
04:24:10,517 --> 04:24:13,386
MATT: Okay, make an acrobatics check, yeah.

4103
04:24:13,386 --> 04:24:18,221
SAM: 23.

4104
04:24:18,221 --> 04:24:25,409
MATT: 23. Okay, so you only take three points of
damage from the fall. You don't fall prone. Okay,

4105
04:24:25,409 --> 04:24:30,344
so going full movement from there, you can get
there. Grog, full movement. Where are you going?

4106
04:24:30,344 --> 04:24:32,109
TRAVIS: I'd like to go straight for Vex.

4107
04:24:32,109 --> 04:24:37,111
MATT: Vex? Okay, that would get you right there,
with your movement. And then Keyleth--

4108
04:24:37,111 --> 04:24:40,403
MARISHA: I'm going for the black thing.

4109
04:24:40,403 --> 04:24:47,346
MATT: You will have to go around and go up these
steps to get to it. With full double movement,

4110
04:24:47,346 --> 04:24:54,163
that will put you about there. All right.

4111
04:24:54,163 --> 04:24:56,264
LIAM: 4d4 plus four.

4112
04:24:56,264 --> 04:25:05,187
MATT: Yeah, you pop off the vial, you go and pop
it into her mouth and take the vial away. There

4113
04:25:05,187 --> 04:25:07,824
doesn't appear to be any effect.

4114
04:25:07,824 --> 04:25:10,480
LIAM: With no talk of death saves at all?

4115
04:25:10,480 --> 04:25:12,633
MARISHA: Get her out of the room. Get out of the
room!

4116
04:25:12,633 --> 04:25:14,677
MATT: Make a death saving throw.

4117
04:25:14,677 --> 04:25:17,556
LAURA: Get me out of here!

4118
04:25:17,556 --> 04:25:22,585
LIAM: How do we get her-- Keyleth, we need
vines! 11, that's a success.

4119
04:25:22,585 --> 04:25:24,124
MATT: You're okay for now.

4120
04:25:24,124 --> 04:25:27,762
LIAM: Fuck that bitch! We need to get my sister
out of this room. Keyleth, can we use vines? What

4121
04:25:27,762 --> 04:25:30,365
can we use to get my sister out of this room now?

4122
04:25:30,365 --> 04:25:32,933
TRAVIS: I'll pick her up and start running towards
the door at the back of the room.

4123
04:25:32,933 --> 04:25:34,820
MARISHA: What door is open?

4124
04:25:34,820 --> 04:25:36,018
MATT: Neither.

4125
04:25:36,018 --> 04:25:37,858
LIAM: We've got to get her up and out.

4126
04:25:37,858 --> 04:25:41,567
TRAVIS: What do the doors look like?

4127
04:25:41,567 --> 04:25:45,275
MATT: You can't tell from here. You're too far,
and the doors are on this side and this side, and

4128
04:25:45,275 --> 04:25:46,276
they were closed.

4129
04:25:46,276 --> 04:25:47,663
LIAM: Percival, do you have a rope?

4130
04:25:47,663 --> 04:25:48,599
TALIESIN: She has the rope.

4131
04:25:48,599 --> 04:25:52,625
LIAM: I pull the rope out from my sister's side
and I start lassoing it-- fuck that-- throw it up

4132
04:25:52,625 --> 04:25:53,897
to Percival.

4133
04:25:53,897 --> 04:25:55,167
MATT: Okay.

4134
04:25:55,167 --> 04:25:56,228
TALIESIN: I grab it.

4135
04:25:56,228 --> 04:26:00,076
MATT: It takes a couple of tries, but you manage
to get to the 40-foot top there. Make another

4136
04:26:00,076 --> 04:26:01,294
death saving throw.

4137
04:26:01,294 --> 04:26:04,374
LIAM: I'm tying it to my sister right now. Come
on.

4138
04:26:04,374 --> 04:26:05,412
LAURA: Oh no.

4139
04:26:05,412 --> 04:26:11,392
LIAM: Fail. I've tied it around my sister. Pike,
Percy, pull!

4140
04:26:11,392 --> 04:26:18,720
TALIESIN: I am going to grab the rope, and I am
literally just going to jump off the side and I'm

4141
04:26:18,720 --> 04:26:21,137
going to fling her up.

4142
04:26:21,137 --> 04:26:25,140
SAM: You might miss, and hurt her.

4143
04:26:25,140 --> 04:26:26,965
MARISHA: She's already dead!

4144
04:26:26,965 --> 04:26:29,743
SAM: Wait, before you do this: have we tried a
Healing Word on her?

4145
04:26:29,743 --> 04:26:30,858
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Yes.

4146
04:26:30,858 --> 04:26:33,705
MATT: 17 points of damage from the fall.

4147
04:26:33,705 --> 04:26:34,614
MARISHA: How many?

4148
04:26:34,614 --> 04:26:35,583
MATT: 17 points.

4149
04:26:35,583 --> 04:26:36,831
TALIESIN: Done.

4150
04:26:36,831 --> 04:26:39,469
TRAVIS: I'll run to the door that's closest to
us.

4151
04:26:39,469 --> 04:26:43,268
MATT: You manage to get her up to the top. Grog,
you're the one who has her right now?

4152
04:26:43,268 --> 04:26:44,996
LIAM: Pike, please help her!

4153
04:26:44,996 --> 04:26:50,918
ASHLEY: Okay. We've got to get her out of here, or
nothing's going to work, right?

4154
04:26:50,918 --> 04:26:53,270
LIAM: Pull her out the door and heal her! It will
work.

4155
04:26:53,270 --> 04:26:55,050
ASHLEY: Okay, let me try to pull her out the
door.

4156
04:26:55,050 --> 04:26:56,367
MARISHA: Is she over?

4157
04:26:56,367 --> 04:26:58,026
MATT: No, you pulled her up onto the roof.

4158
04:26:58,026 --> 04:26:59,534
LAURA: It might work on the roof.

4159
04:26:59,534 --> 04:27:01,560
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to try it up on the roof.

4160
04:27:01,560 --> 04:27:02,818
MATT: Try on the roof.

4161
04:27:02,818 --> 04:27:04,017
ASHLEY: Healing Word again.

4162
04:27:04,017 --> 04:27:06,607
MARISHA: You're touching her. You're near her.

4163
04:27:06,607 --> 04:27:09,329
ASHLEY: Wait, I'm touching her? Cure Wounds!

4164
04:27:09,329 --> 04:27:12,905
MATT: Okay, you go for Cure Wounds. You pull up
your holy symbol and put your hand to her.

4165
04:27:12,905 --> 04:27:14,692
Nothing's happening.

4166
04:27:14,692 --> 04:27:16,166
(cursing)

4167
04:27:16,166 --> 04:27:17,510
LIAM: Pull her out of here!

4168
04:27:17,510 --> 04:27:18,817
MATT: Make another death saving throw.

4169
04:27:18,817 --> 04:27:21,035
LAURA: (laughing) Oh my god, I'm going to die.

4170
04:27:21,035 --> 04:27:22,193
MARISHA: You're not going to die.

4171
04:27:22,193 --> 04:27:23,507
LIAM: 12. Save.

4172
04:27:23,507 --> 04:27:24,482
MARISHA: You're saved!

4173
04:27:24,482 --> 04:27:25,679
LIAM: Pull her out!

4174
04:27:25,679 --> 04:27:26,626
LAURA: Oh god!

4175
04:27:26,626 --> 04:27:27,788
MATT: What are you guys doing?

4176
04:27:27,788 --> 04:27:28,836
SAM: Where is she?

4177
04:27:28,836 --> 04:27:32,698
MATT: She's on top of the wall here. She's been
lifted out by Grog and Percival.

4178
04:27:32,698 --> 04:27:35,051
LIAM: I'm running at the wall and I'm trying to
climb it, stupidly.

4179
04:27:35,051 --> 04:27:39,095
MATT: Okay. Roll a climb check. Roll athletics.

4180
04:27:39,095 --> 04:27:41,325
TRAVIS: What about the little penny? The dime?

4181
04:27:41,325 --> 04:27:43,351
LIAM: 15.

4182
04:27:43,351 --> 04:27:49,343
MATT: 15? (grunts) You get partway up. You climb
over bodies. You're using the bodies on the wall

4183
04:27:49,343 --> 04:27:50,360
to climb up.

4184
04:27:50,360 --> 04:27:52,878
MARISHA: Can I throw Vax something real quick? Can
I toss him something?

4185
04:27:52,878 --> 04:27:54,879
MATT: You can move up and do it, yeah.

4186
04:27:54,879 --> 04:27:59,536
MARISHA: No, before he runs that way. Can I toss
you the Immovable Rod?

4187
04:27:59,536 --> 04:28:04,376
MATT: He doesn't even pay attention. He bolts
past, towards the wall. He's already out.

4188
04:28:04,376 --> 04:28:06,886
MARISHA: Never mind. I'm trying to get to this
black hole.

4189
04:28:06,886 --> 04:28:09,359
TALIESIN: Good call.

4190
04:28:09,359 --> 04:28:11,449
MATT: You get up there.

4191
04:28:11,449 --> 04:28:13,429
ASHLEY: Can I try Divine Intervention right now?

4192
04:28:13,429 --> 04:28:15,374
MATT: That's your full turn. You want to do Divine
Intervention?

4193
04:28:15,374 --> 04:28:16,819
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4194
04:28:16,819 --> 04:28:18,223
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll.

4195
04:28:18,223 --> 04:28:20,192
SAM: What is that?

4196
04:28:20,192 --> 04:28:36,283
MATT: Roll a d10 and then another d10, and let me
know the numbers in succession.

4197
04:28:36,283 --> 04:28:37,670
ASHLEY: 12.

4198
04:28:37,670 --> 04:28:39,788
MATT: You are what level?

4199
04:28:39,788 --> 04:28:41,078
ASHLEY: 11.

4200
04:28:41,078 --> 04:28:43,524
MATT: Unfortunately, that just fails.

4201
04:28:43,524 --> 04:28:51,802
LIAM: I scream at the top of my lungs, pull her
out of here! I'm still climbing dead bodies.

4202
04:28:51,802 --> 04:28:59,508
TALIESIN: I've got hold of the rope and just
trying to yell, toss her off! Because that way

4203
04:28:59,508 --> 04:29:01,493
we can see if we can counterweight her back down.

4204
04:29:01,493 --> 04:29:05,388
TRAVIS: I'm at the top, so we can gently get her
down. I could jump down with you.

4205
04:29:05,388 --> 04:29:06,414
LAURA: Okay.

4206
04:29:06,414 --> 04:29:08,843
TRAVIS: I'll jump and hold her.

4207
04:29:08,843 --> 04:29:10,928
TALIESIN: I'll ride the rope up.

4208
04:29:10,928 --> 04:29:14,028
MATT: Okay. You're on the same side as them
jumping down now.

4209
04:29:14,028 --> 04:29:16,252
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right. Never mind.

4210
04:29:16,252 --> 04:29:17,790
MATT: They would come down to meet you.

4211
04:29:17,790 --> 04:29:19,123
LIAM: Have I reached the top?

4212
04:29:19,123 --> 04:29:21,941
MATT: We'll say now you've managed to climb up
towards the top.

4213
04:29:21,941 --> 04:29:27,204
LIAM: I want to pick up Pike under my arm like a
fucking football and run forward after my sister.

4214
04:29:27,204 --> 04:29:29,124
MATT: You grab her and bolt off the side.

4215
04:29:29,124 --> 04:29:35,032
TRAVIS: Once we hit the ground-- we're outside of
the room, right? Should we try to heal her? I've

4216
04:29:35,032 --> 04:29:36,136
got a common.

4217
04:29:36,136 --> 04:29:40,378
MATT: There's going to be 14 points of fall damage
to you as you land because right now you're not

4218
04:29:40,378 --> 04:29:44,139
carefully landing. This is just clutching her and
jumping off. You, make an acrobatics check.

4219
04:29:44,139 --> 04:29:48,494
LIAM: That's a 20.

4220
04:29:48,494 --> 04:29:54,608
MATT: 20? Okay. You manage to take only two damage
from the fall. Make another death saving throw.

4221
04:29:54,608 --> 04:29:58,170
TALIESIN: I believe in you!

4222
04:29:58,170 --> 04:30:00,309
LAURA: Save. I've only failed one.

4223
04:30:00,309 --> 04:30:05,198
LIAM: I'm planting Pike's glowing form right down
on my sister's chest.

4224
04:30:05,198 --> 04:30:07,954
TRAVIS: Can I put a common? I have a common.

4225
04:30:07,954 --> 04:30:13,713
LIAM: You did succeed three times.

4226
04:30:13,713 --> 04:30:15,340
TALIESIN: She succeeded three times.

4227
04:30:15,340 --> 04:30:17,966
MATT: Three times. No, you succeeded--

4228
04:30:17,966 --> 04:30:18,945
SAM: Twice.

4229
04:30:18,945 --> 04:30:19,920
LAURA: Three times.

4230
04:30:19,920 --> 04:30:26,051
MATT: Three times. Yeah, so with that, as you're
carrying her there, there's a moment where all of

4231
04:30:26,051 --> 04:30:33,667
a sudden, Vex's eyes open and (deep breath). Vex
is sitting there, looking around, confused,

4232
04:30:33,667 --> 04:30:38,696
catching her breath in Grog's arms as he's bolting
down the steps of the ziggurat.

4233
04:30:38,696 --> 04:30:47,710
LAURA: Grog, you smell terrible. (chuckles
weakly)

4234
04:30:47,710 --> 04:30:49,820
SAM: Maybe we should get out of here.

4235
04:30:49,820 --> 04:30:51,409
TRAVIS: Do something to that little ball.

4236
04:30:51,409 --> 04:31:00,068
MARISHA: I'm alone with the little ball, aren't I?
Okay, I'm going to go up to it. Can I tell any

4237
04:31:00,068 --> 04:31:03,441
type of magical properties from it from looking at
it?

4238
04:31:03,441 --> 04:31:04,978
MATT: Make an arcana check.

4239
04:31:04,978 --> 04:31:10,269
MARISHA: Oh, Jesus. Oh, that's good! 19 total?

4240
04:31:10,269 --> 04:31:18,415
MATT: 19 total. You have no idea what this is. You
haven't seen something like this before. You

4241
04:31:18,415 --> 04:31:24,077
inspect it very closely, and it's literally like
the sphere has been shrunk to this size. You look

4242
04:31:24,077 --> 04:31:26,776
very closely and it looks like it's spinning
impossibly fast in place.

4243
04:31:26,776 --> 04:31:28,214
TRAVIS: Who's still in there?

4244
04:31:28,214 --> 04:31:31,328
SAM: I'm in there. I go up there, too.

4245
04:31:31,328 --> 04:31:33,439
TRAVIS: Check on Lady Shithead.

4246
04:31:33,439 --> 04:31:41,816
SAM: Yeah? Okay, I'm going to turn back and go to
check out Lady Shithead. I don't know why I'm

4247
04:31:41,816 --> 04:31:43,466
still in this room. We should get out of here.

4248
04:31:43,466 --> 04:31:46,550
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and open the doors from
that side to see if there's any way to open them.

4249
04:31:46,550 --> 04:31:48,426
MATT: Make a strength check.

4250
04:31:48,426 --> 04:31:53,441
MARISHA: What is the net of dead bodies doing? Are
they limp?

4251
04:31:53,441 --> 04:31:56,284
MATT: They're just limp. Still in the tapestry,
arms fallen.

4252
04:31:56,284 --> 04:32:00,467
TALIESIN: 11.

4253
04:32:00,467 --> 04:32:03,443
MATT: 11? Doors aren't budging.

4254
04:32:03,443 --> 04:32:05,949
TRAVIS: Here, you take your sister. I'll go back
to the doors.

4255
04:32:05,949 --> 04:32:07,466
LIAM: All right.

4256
04:32:07,466 --> 04:32:09,579
TRAVIS: I go back to the doors and try the doors.

4257
04:32:09,579 --> 04:32:12,170
MATT: Okay. Strength check.

4258
04:32:12,170 --> 04:32:15,227
ASHLEY: Can I try to Cure Wounds again, on Vex?

4259
04:32:15,227 --> 04:32:25,233
MATT: Okay. You run up to Vex as she's in Vax's
arms. Once again, the spell slot is expended, but

4260
04:32:25,233 --> 04:32:31,050
no magic seems to appear. There is some sort of
blockage or void of magic use in this vicinity.

4261
04:32:31,050 --> 04:32:33,440
MARISHA: Even outside of this building?

4262
04:32:33,440 --> 04:32:34,553
TRAVIS: 19.

4263
04:32:34,553 --> 04:32:41,045
MATT: 19? (impact noise) The doors slam open from
the force of Grog's foot, opening the passageway

4264
04:32:41,045 --> 04:32:42,695
inside the room.

4265
04:32:42,695 --> 04:32:44,398
MARISHA: Would my Sunbeam still be up?

4266
04:32:44,398 --> 04:32:46,735
MATT: No, that's passed, for now.

4267
04:32:46,735 --> 04:32:50,011
TRAVIS: Can I make my way over to Scanlan to go
check on Lady Briarwood?

4268
04:32:50,011 --> 04:32:52,923
MATT: Sure. You eventually make your way there at
a full run. You run around the corner and you can

4269
04:32:52,923 --> 04:32:53,956
see her.

4270
04:32:53,956 --> 04:32:54,994
SAM: Alive? Dead?

4271
04:32:54,994 --> 04:33:04,259
MATT: She is on the ground, unconscious, sitting
in this carved hand symbol in the ground.

4272
04:33:04,259 --> 04:33:10,279
SAM: Do we want this girl alive for some reason? I
can't move her.

4273
04:33:10,279 --> 04:33:15,342
TRAVIS: We need to figure out what we're doing
with the little black ball of universal death.

4274
04:33:15,342 --> 04:33:16,774
TALIESIN: Let's get her out of there.

4275
04:33:16,774 --> 04:33:18,427
SAM: Let's just get us out of here.

4276
04:33:18,427 --> 04:33:19,756
TRAVIS: Could we just leave it?

4277
04:33:19,756 --> 04:33:21,850
LAURA: No. Can you put it in a vial?

4278
04:33:21,850 --> 04:33:23,547
SAM: Put it in a vial?

4279
04:33:23,547 --> 04:33:29,687
MARISHA: I pull out a piece of that green glass
that we took from before.

4280
04:33:29,687 --> 04:33:33,137
SAM: Okay, that's smart.

4281
04:33:33,137 --> 04:33:34,600
TRAVIS: Give it a poke.

4282
04:33:34,600 --> 04:33:36,215
MARISHA: I'm going to jam it into it.

4283
04:33:36,215 --> 04:33:37,546
MATT: Okay.

4284
04:33:37,546 --> 04:33:38,757
LAURA: Oh god.

4285
04:33:38,757 --> 04:33:41,921
SAM: Just hit the black hole.

4286
04:33:41,921 --> 04:33:50,037
MATT: Make a strength saving throw.

4287
04:33:50,037 --> 04:33:51,645
TALIESIN: Whoa!

4288
04:33:51,645 --> 04:33:53,450
MARISHA: That's a natural 20.

4289
04:33:53,450 --> 04:34:03,066
MATT: As you take the glass and jam it in there,
the glass, in what seems almost like slow-mo,

4290
04:34:03,066 --> 04:34:11,070
seems to crackle and shatter like brittle stone,
and immediately vanish into the darkness. As your

4291
04:34:11,070 --> 04:34:17,122
hand gets to that point of no resistance, you feel
this immediate, extremely strong suction begin to

4292
04:34:17,122 --> 04:34:27,803
pull towards your hand, and you yank back with all
your might, suffering 18 points of damage as you

4293
04:34:27,803 --> 04:34:32,013
(grunts) pull away from this small spinning orb.

4294
04:34:32,013 --> 04:34:34,210
SAM: Okay, so maybe we don't touch the orb
anymore.

4295
04:34:34,210 --> 04:34:35,721
LAURA: Don't touch the orb.

4296
04:34:35,721 --> 04:34:38,723
MARISHA: Nothing happened to it? Still just--

4297
04:34:38,723 --> 04:34:41,304
MATT: Still just sitting there. A little speck in
space.

4298
04:34:41,304 --> 04:34:44,590
TALIESIN: We're not leaving this thing.

4299
04:34:44,590 --> 04:34:46,719
MARISHA and SAM: What do you mean we're not
leaving it?!

4300
04:34:46,719 --> 04:34:48,752
SAM: What are we going to do to it?

4301
04:34:48,752 --> 04:34:50,075
MARISHA: It's indestructible.

4302
04:34:50,075 --> 04:34:54,555
TRAVIS: We're obviously not equipped. I'll grab
Lady Briarwood and drag her out of the room

4303
04:34:54,555 --> 04:34:55,704
towards the doors.

4304
04:34:55,704 --> 04:34:56,541
MATT: Okay.

4305
04:34:56,541 --> 04:34:59,285
SAM: Wait, what's that-- the horn of--

4306
04:34:59,285 --> 04:35:00,580
TRAVIS: Orcus?

4307
04:35:00,580 --> 04:35:03,388
SAM: The Horn of Orcus? Can that counter-- we
don't have it.

4308
04:35:03,388 --> 04:35:06,623
LAURA: You want to put the two bad things
together?

4309
04:35:06,623 --> 04:35:09,194
SAM: Yeah, maybe they'll become a good thing.

4310
04:35:09,194 --> 04:35:10,211
LAURA: No.

4311
04:35:10,211 --> 04:35:10,874
SAM: No?

4312
04:35:10,874 --> 04:35:12,060
LAURA: Two negatives make a positive?

4313
04:35:12,060 --> 04:35:14,372
SAM: That's what I say to all my women.

4314
04:35:14,372 --> 04:35:21,126
LIAM: I don't know what's going on, but I've got
her and I'm hugging her from behind and turning my

4315
04:35:21,126 --> 04:35:24,485
back towards whatever is in that room. I don't
know what's going on.

4316
04:35:24,485 --> 04:35:25,859
MATT: Okay.

4317
04:35:25,859 --> 04:35:31,139
MARISHA: I can try and tear this whole building
down. I still have my elemental shape. I can go

4318
04:35:31,139 --> 04:35:33,295
earth elemental and start ripping this thing
apart.

4319
04:35:33,295 --> 04:35:35,353
TRAVIS: Bury it like the pharaohs of old?

4320
04:35:35,353 --> 04:35:42,295
SAM: Sure. Why not? Let's get out of here. Do you
want to take Briarwood with us, or bury her in the

4321
04:35:42,295 --> 04:35:43,626
rubble?

4322
04:35:43,626 --> 04:35:45,339
TRAVIS: We can't kill her in here.

4323
04:35:45,339 --> 04:35:49,004
TALIESIN: I'm afraid of what blood will do to that
thing.

4324
04:35:49,004 --> 04:35:51,413
TRAVIS: She kept talking about a sacrifice. We
can't kill her.

4325
04:35:51,413 --> 04:35:53,509
SAM: You think she was going to jump into that
orb?

4326
04:35:53,509 --> 04:35:57,321
TRAVIS: I think she understood she had to give a
life for it.

4327
04:35:57,321 --> 04:35:59,886
MARISHA: I think something was going to come
through that orb.

4328
04:35:59,886 --> 04:36:00,977
LAURA: Yeah.

4329
04:36:00,977 --> 04:36:05,411
LIAM: Let's drag her out of here. Percy, you can
shoot her in the head a hundred yards from here.

4330
04:36:05,411 --> 04:36:08,307
TRAVIS: And then you can bury it once we're out of
the way.

4331
04:36:08,307 --> 04:36:10,127
MARISHA: Okay.

4332
04:36:10,127 --> 04:36:13,099
TRAVIS: I drag her out of the room and toward the
steps.

4333
04:36:13,099 --> 04:36:17,900
MATT: Okay. As you're holding her in your arms,
what's everyone doing?

4334
04:36:17,900 --> 04:36:19,546
MARISHA: Everyone, get out.

4335
04:36:19,546 --> 04:36:22,545
LIAM: I'm picking up my sister and lurching after
Grog.

4336
04:36:22,545 --> 04:36:23,723
LAURA: I can walk.

4337
04:36:23,723 --> 04:36:25,701
LIAM: I'm picking you up, and I'm lurching after
Grog!

4338
04:36:25,701 --> 04:36:31,442
MATT: So as Grog rushes down the steps of the
ziggurat, clutching the unconscious and bleeding

4339
04:36:31,442 --> 04:36:39,084
body of Lady Delilah Briarwood. Vax rushing
behind, carrying the barely-conscious, limp body

4340
04:36:39,084 --> 04:36:46,592
of Vex'ahlia, the rest of you racing out. You,
your hand bloodied from the terrible force of

4341
04:36:46,592 --> 04:36:52,600
whatever that was. You go charging down the steps
of the ziggurat. Is anyone taking Cassandra, or

4342
04:36:52,600 --> 04:36:53,652
are you leaving her behind?

4343
04:36:53,652 --> 04:36:54,884
TALIESIN: I'm taking Cassandra.

4344
04:36:54,884 --> 04:36:57,792
MATT: You reach over and pick up Cassandra, put
her over your shoulder, and you begin racing down

4345
04:36:57,792 --> 04:36:59,251
the front of the ziggurat steps.

4346
04:36:59,251 --> 04:37:01,449
MARISHA: Am I tearing this place down?

4347
04:37:01,449 --> 04:37:03,215
TRAVIS: Not yet. Not until we're out of here.

4348
04:37:03,215 --> 04:37:05,552
MARISHA: I'll stay behind.

4349
04:37:05,552 --> 04:37:06,829
MATT: You stay behind?

4350
04:37:06,829 --> 04:37:09,234
TRAVIS: Do you have to be there to do it?

4351
04:37:09,234 --> 04:37:12,397
MARISHA: Being an earth elemental and ripping it
apart.

4352
04:37:12,397 --> 04:37:13,759
LIAM: She's doing it physically.

4353
04:37:13,759 --> 04:37:16,287
TRAVIS: Well, let's all get to the point where
it's not going to collapse on us.

4354
04:37:16,287 --> 04:37:19,676
TALIESIN: Why don't we just open up the acid and
let it pour down in there.

4355
04:37:19,676 --> 04:37:21,011
SAM: Where is that?

4356
04:37:21,011 --> 04:37:22,336
LAURA: That's so far away.

4357
04:37:22,336 --> 04:37:26,569
TALIESIN: We have to go that way, anyway. Once we
get there, let's open the spigot, point it towards

4358
04:37:26,569 --> 04:37:28,326
the doors, and let it do its work.

4359
04:37:28,326 --> 04:37:32,032
MARISHA: I don't know if that's enough acid to
take down and destroy a thing.

4360
04:37:32,032 --> 04:37:36,398
LAURA: Might as well try it. Do we have any acid?
You have acid, can we pour it?

4361
04:37:36,398 --> 04:37:38,068
TRAVIS: It's like three little acid vials.

4362
04:37:38,068 --> 04:37:39,951
LIAM: We've got acid from a tube.

4363
04:37:39,951 --> 04:37:44,498
SAM: Why don't we just seal up the hole and get
out of here?

4364
04:37:44,498 --> 04:37:49,505
LIAM: Let's get out of here. Keyleth, it's a good
idea. Destroy the temple.

4365
04:37:49,505 --> 04:37:54,477
TALIESIN: Do some damage to the temple, and then
once we're all the way out, we'll open the acid.

4366
04:37:54,477 --> 04:37:57,877
MARISHA: Do we want to leave a spinning black hole
of death under the city?

4367
04:37:57,877 --> 04:38:03,029
TALIESIN: It could just swallow the entire city
and everybody could die. This is my problem, at

4368
04:38:03,029 --> 04:38:04,399
the moment.

4369
04:38:04,399 --> 04:38:09,073
MARISHA: You guys go. I'm going to tear it down.
I'll be okay. I'll meet you there.

4370
04:38:09,073 --> 04:38:11,152
LAURA: What?

4371
04:38:11,152 --> 04:38:12,452
ASHLEY: No.

4372
04:38:12,452 --> 04:38:15,160
TALIESIN: She can earth shape. She'll be fine.

4373
04:38:15,160 --> 04:38:24,328
LIAM: I push my sister into Grog's massive arms
because he can hold fucking five people, and I

4374
04:38:24,328 --> 04:38:26,346
start running back towards the ziggurat.

4375
04:38:26,346 --> 04:38:27,577
MATT: Okay.

4376
04:38:27,577 --> 04:38:29,664
LAURA: I'm laying on top of Lady Briarwood right
now.

4377
04:38:29,664 --> 04:38:30,828
LIAM: Yes. Yes, you are.

4378
04:38:30,828 --> 04:38:32,192
LAURA: Great.

4379
04:38:32,192 --> 04:38:34,757
TALIESIN: 70 percent of her, at the very least.

4380
04:38:34,757 --> 04:38:38,041
MARISHA: I stand at the top of the temple, and I
wait to see them go out of range.

4381
04:38:38,041 --> 04:38:44,031
MATT: Okay. They all begin to step down the bottom
of the stairs, except for Vax, who begins running

4382
04:38:44,031 --> 04:38:45,466
back up the steps towards you.

4383
04:38:45,466 --> 04:38:52,750
MARISHA: Vax, go. No. Go.

4384
04:38:52,750 --> 04:38:55,123
LIAM: Whatever you're going to do, just fucking do
it.

4385
04:38:55,123 --> 04:39:02,722
MARISHA: I concentrate for a minute, and I go into
the ground.

4386
04:39:02,722 --> 04:39:08,979
MATT: As you focus your attention towards your
earthen core and triggering the transformation

4387
04:39:08,979 --> 04:39:12,735
effect, nothing happens.

4388
04:39:12,735 --> 04:39:14,248
LAURA: Magic. It kills all magic!

4389
04:39:14,248 --> 04:39:15,361
MARISHA: Even Beast Shape?

4390
04:39:15,361 --> 04:39:16,739
MATT: It's a magical transformation.

4391
04:39:16,739 --> 04:39:20,089
MARISHA: Never mind! Run!

4392
04:39:20,089 --> 04:39:21,531
(laughter)

4393
04:39:21,531 --> 04:39:22,747
MARISHA: Fuck it! Run.

4394
04:39:22,747 --> 04:39:23,588
TRAVIS: We all leave.

4395
04:39:23,588 --> 04:39:25,763
LAURA: Can you try pouring acid on the thingy?

4396
04:39:25,763 --> 04:39:27,969
TALIESIN: I'm going to do it once we're out. We're
just going to go.

4397
04:39:27,969 --> 04:39:30,969
MATT: As Vox Machina charges down the front of the
steps of the ziggurat,

4398
04:39:30,969 --> 04:39:33,419
we'll call that for the night.

4399
04:39:33,419 --> 04:39:35,987
(groaning)

4400
04:39:35,987 --> 04:39:37,978
LAURA: And I rolled a one right as that final.

4401
04:39:37,978 --> 04:39:39,416
LIAM: For no reason.

4402
04:39:39,416 --> 04:39:40,821
SAM: We killed the Briarwoods.

4403
04:39:40,821 --> 04:39:42,234
TALIESIN: Well, one and a half of them.

4404
04:39:42,234 --> 04:39:44,936
SAM: We didn't die. Yet.

4405
04:39:44,936 --> 04:39:46,073
LAURA and MARISHA: Oh my god.

4406
04:39:46,073 --> 04:39:51,593
LAURA: I can't believe I almost died again from
that damn death ray!

4407
04:39:51,593 --> 04:39:53,713
MARISHA: By one point.

4408
04:39:53,713 --> 04:39:58,943
TRAVIS: So if you had rolled 76 points of necrotic
damage?

4409
04:39:58,943 --> 04:40:01,799
MATT: She'd have been dead instantly and then come
back as a zombie in the next round.

4410
04:40:01,799 --> 04:40:03,121
MARISHA: And would become what?

4411
04:40:03,121 --> 04:40:05,867
LAURA: If I hadn't taken that potion right before
I leapt off--

4412
04:40:05,867 --> 04:40:07,078
MATT: You would have been dead.

4413
04:40:07,078 --> 04:40:10,091
MARISHA: Thank god you took that fucking potion!

4414
04:40:10,091 --> 04:40:13,624
MATT: That went a little longer than anticipated.

4415
04:40:13,624 --> 04:40:14,963
LIAM: You're a bad man!

4416
04:40:14,963 --> 04:41:00,788
[no audio]

4417
04:41:00,788 --> 04:41:02,533
(laughter)

4418
04:41:02,533 --> 04:41:04,097
MARISHA: I think Pike's playlist is up right now.

4419
04:41:04,097 --> 04:41:05,465
TALIESIN: Hey!

4420
04:41:05,465 --> 04:41:08,841
SAM: Hey, Percy? How much does that comic cost?

4421
04:41:08,841 --> 04:41:10,540
TALIESIN: That comic is--

4422
04:41:10,540 --> 04:41:11,637
SAM: Free.

4423
04:41:11,637 --> 04:41:14,980
TALIESIN: Was free. After this weekend, it's one
healing potion.

4424
04:41:14,980 --> 04:41:17,418
MARISHA: That won't work.

4425
04:41:17,418 --> 04:41:19,673
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

4426
04:41:19,673 --> 04:41:21,230
LAURA: A bunch of wasted healing potions.

4427
04:41:21,230 --> 04:41:24,641
MATT: Okay, guys. Thank you all so much for your
patience, for your diligence, for watching this

4428
04:41:24,641 --> 04:41:25,988
extremely--

4429
04:41:25,988 --> 04:41:26,920
LAURA: Long.

4430
04:41:26,920 --> 04:41:30,479
MATT: Long, dark episode. We'll see you next week.
Is it Thursday yet?

4431
04:41:30,479 --> 04:41:32,452
LIAM: (mock-crying) Is it Thursday yet?

4432
04:41:32,452 --> 04:41:33,886
TALIESIN: Oh, god.
