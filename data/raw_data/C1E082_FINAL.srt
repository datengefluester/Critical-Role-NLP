1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,630
 You know what I mean?

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:02,730
 I don't know.

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,880
 I don't think--
this is a bad idea.

4
00:00:02,616 --> 00:00:03,616
 Why can't I just--

5
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,450
 Vex, Vax, and Keyleth--
as you guys are having this

6
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:08,000
conversation, something
catches the corner of your eye,

7
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,660
and you watch something just go
[WHOOSHING NOISE] and just whiz

8
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,060
past.

9
00:00:10,685 --> 00:00:11,685
 Oh, shit.

10
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,000
 Like from in the bottom
of the ravine to the top.

11
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:14,085
Just--

12
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,680
 Like what?

13
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,180
 We saw that.

14
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,840
We saw that.

15
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,060
 You saw something
quickly just go by.

16
00:00:17,124 --> 00:00:18,267
 Can I get a better look?

17
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:19,367
Can I look and see--

18
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,200
 Can we, after the fact--

19
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,420
 --if I see it again?

20
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,100
 --try to figure
out what we see?

21
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,510
 Do we roll alone?

22
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,940
 Yeah.

23
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,090
The three of you guys
make a perception check,

24
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,986
as you kind of come up
to the edge and look.

25
00:00:24,086 --> 00:00:25,230
 Oh, shit.

26
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,330
 26.

27
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:27,870
 14.

28
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,200
 Is this related to dragons?

29
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,960
 This is not
related to dragons.

30
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,400
 Ha, ha, ha.

31
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,300
 That is a 21.

32
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,120
 26.

33
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,320
 OK.

34
00:00:40,157 --> 00:00:41,157
 Best we got.

35
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,740
 All right.

36
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,380
So you're kind of
seeing little things--

37
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,970
just right out of the
middle of the light,

38
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,572
you can see just something
shifting above and below you.

39
00:00:53,672 --> 00:00:55,112
You guys have a
little better view.

40
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,570
You still can't quite see.

41
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,310
The length of your
darkvision is too far for you

42
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,530
to see what is below you,
or initially what's above.

43
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:03,581
But you--

44
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,490
 Can I-- as a quick reaction--
grab the rope bridge?

45
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,590
 Yeah.

46
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,150
 OK.

47
00:01:08,054 --> 00:01:09,414
 So you're still
off to the side,

48
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,670
just holding on to the bridge?

49
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,070
 Grasping, yeah.

50
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:11,970
 OK.

51
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,048
You are being watched.

52
00:01:14,148 --> 00:01:21,230
[BLOWING NOISE] What
looks to be figures--

53
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,887
humanoid bodies.

54
00:01:22,987 --> 00:01:23,987
 Oh, I have a theory.

55
00:01:23,903 --> 00:01:24,903
 Are those spirits?

56
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,216
 They're just kind
of tumbling past.

57
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:28,278
One of them kind of hits
the edge of the bridge--

58
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,959
[CRACKING NOISE] and
keeps spinning off,

59
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,740
and just disappears
in the darkness above.

60
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,270
 I have a weird theory.

61
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,370
 Awesome.

62
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,870
 I'm to grab--

63
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,540
what do I have that
I can do this with?

64
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,640
 Yes, Percy?

65
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,670
 But they look like
spirits floating upwards?

66
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:39,930
 Or do they look like bodies?

67
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,650
 You watch a few more.

68
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,330
You watch a couple more go by,
and they are nearly-skeletal

69
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,430
bodies--

70
00:01:45,342 --> 00:01:46,342
 Falling upward.

71
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,270
 --falling upward.

72
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,110
But, as they watch a
couple of more go by,

73
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,480
they're limp,
somewhat, but still

74
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,856
moving as they scoot past.

75
00:01:55,956 --> 00:01:56,956
 Oh, no.

76
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:57,455
 Oh, Jesus.

77
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,726
 Let's just get
across here, shall we?

78
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,710
 I'm going to use
divine sense now--

79
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,810
 OK.

80
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,080
 --just to confirm.

81
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,812
 You have to wait
about a minute or so

82
00:02:05,912 --> 00:02:07,832
before one comes close
enough to hit the sense,

83
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,500
but there is an undead
energy that passes past.

84
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,360
And both you and Kerr
kind of have this moment

85
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:19,441
from across the ravine from
each other seeing this.

86
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:20,541
 I'm going to try and--

87
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,740
 Kerr will throw up the horns.

88
00:02:21,548 --> 00:02:22,548
 [LAUGHS]

89
00:02:22,048 --> 00:02:25,215
 That's me to you, man.

90
00:02:25,315 --> 00:02:26,315
 Try and clock them.

91
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,190
See if it's the same bodies
over and over again--

92
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,710
if it's in that loop of falling.

93
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:30,810
 Oh, interesting.

94
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,400
 An infinite loop of falling?

95
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,370
 OK, so I want to
get a good look at--

96
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,470
 Oh, it's a gif.

97
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,240
 --one of them as
they go by and see.

98
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,490
 OK.

99
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,990
 It's a gif.

100
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:37,629
 It's a gif.

101
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,170
Six seconds.

102
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,380
So I'm just-- aw, aw!

103
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,850
 Three or four
more stumble past.

104
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,336
[CRACKING NOISE] And they're
getting more and more--

105
00:02:44,436 --> 00:02:45,481
 More and more frequent.

106
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:46,581
 --rapid.

107
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,080
And they're--

108
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,290
 We should probably go.

109
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,700
 They're different sizes.

110
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,599
They do not appear to
be the same bodies.

111
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:52,699
 Go, go, go, go, go, go.

112
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,030
 I pick up Pike and try
to barrel roll across.

113
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,130
 OK.

114
00:02:56,649 --> 00:02:57,649
 You got it.

115
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,250
 You barrel roll across.

116
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,365
As you're making it
across, three more

117
00:03:00,465 --> 00:03:03,260
come tumbling up-- two of them
too far away, but one of them

118
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,426
does kind of reach out with his
arms as it tumbles past you,

119
00:03:06,526 --> 00:03:08,246
and kind of swats out
to try and grab you.

120
00:03:08,276 --> 00:03:09,476
 What?

121
00:03:09,795 --> 00:03:13,110
 I need you to make
an acrobatics check.

122
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,210
 You've got this.

123
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,260
Oh, you've got such a bonus.

124
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
Come on, girl.

125
00:03:16,403 --> 00:03:17,403
 I know, I know, I know.

126
00:03:17,444 --> 00:03:18,444


127
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,410
 Such a bonus, huh?

128
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,570
Such a bonus.

129
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,670
 Oh, no.

130
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,870
Look at Matt's face.

131
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,730
Look at his face.

132
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,830
 Oh, fuck, no.

133
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
 But, what?

134
00:03:29,797 --> 00:03:30,797
But he--

135
00:03:29,996 --> 00:03:30,996
 No.

136
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:31,244
Come on.

137
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,250
 Such a bonus.

138
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,646
 No, come on.

139
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:34,746
 Such a bonus

140
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,984
 Did they both make that roll?

141
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:37,444
 She's the one
driving the broom.

142
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,980
She's having to try
and maneuver it.

143
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,040
 She's the one in the air.

144
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,600
 I was about to
interject, and I

145
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,380
know that I didn't
make that fast enough.

146
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,410
 No.

147
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,970
 But at some point,
I would already

148
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,790
like to be moving to
interject in this.

149
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:47,890
 Right.

150
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,460
As you're watching
them start across,

151
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,137
you get a step out
onto the bridge--

152
00:03:51,237 --> 00:03:52,237
 I'm not going onto the--

153
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,255
I'm pulling out my
gun, and trying to--

154
00:03:54,355 --> 00:03:55,355
and like, I see the--

155
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,230
 Oh, wait!

156
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,870
Doesn't Pike have a thing that--

157
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,810
she can help people with their--

158
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,940
 War god's blessing?

159
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,430
 --war god's blessing?

160
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,530
 That's an attack roll.

161
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,530
 Damn it!

162
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:05,966
 That's all right.

163
00:04:05,757 --> 00:04:07,490
War gods don't help you survive.

164
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,590
They help you kill shit.

165
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,670
 They do.

166
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,240
 Do what you were going to do.

167
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,780
 So--

168
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,130
 I was going to start skeet
shooting at some point.

169
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,980
 Well, I rolled a 1.

170
00:04:12,855 --> 00:04:14,620
 I understood, but
before we get to that--

171
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,400
 Yeah, finish it.

172
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,979
 So the creature grabs you,
and essentially grapples you

173
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,079
in the moment.

174
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,710
 Yeah.

175
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,940
 And as that happens, the
momentum of pulling you

176
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,060
up causes the broom to
kind of shift out of whack,

177
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,050
and you begin to careen
at a slight circle.

178
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,910
I need you and Pike to both
make strength saving throws.

179
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,010
 Oh.

180
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,880
 How far away is this from--

181
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,100
 Do you want help with this?

182
00:04:41,435 --> 00:04:42,770
 They're about
30 feet from you.

183
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,870
 Or do you want to do it?

184
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,330
 And what about from Keyleth?

185
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,430
 That's OK.

186
00:04:45,232 --> 00:04:47,112
 About the same, because
your guys are about--

187
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,150
whereas they're on the
other side of the ravine.

188
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:49,832
 You do this?

189
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,120
 I'll do hers.

190
00:04:49,745 --> 00:04:51,179
 She's got a plus
4 on strength.

191
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,279
 Plus 4 on strength?

192
00:04:52,154 --> 00:04:53,154
 Correct.

193
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:53,767
 My foot is asleep.

194
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600


195
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,620
 9 for me.

196
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
 9 for you.

197
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,100
 13 for Pike.

198
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,800
 13 for Pike.

199
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,850
So-- OK.

200
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,430
So Pike's on the broom with you.

201
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,630
 Yeah.

202
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,850
 You get grabbed and
yanked off the broom.

203
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,510
 Oh shit.

204
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,610
 Pike--

205
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,110
 I am tethered.

206
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,900
 --manages to hold the broom.

207
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,462
But currently, Pike was not
the current driver of it.

208
00:05:22,562 --> 00:05:24,002
And so she's
clutching a broom that

209
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,280
is just floating to gravity.

210
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,740
You watch as both
Pike and Vex go

211
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,767
from careening off to tumbling
upward into the darkness above.

212
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,387
 Are they both
attached to the broom?

213
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,450
 No.

214
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,110
Vex is pulled off the broom.

215
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,452
 But she's still tethered.

216
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:39,672
 She's still tethered, yeah.

217
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
 Vex has a tether.

218
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,460
 So both of them are trying to
like [SPUTTERING NOISES] kind

219
00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:43,181
of spinning.

220
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
 It's a slingshot-- bola.

221
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,075
 --to get your motion upward.

222
00:05:45,175 --> 00:05:46,335
 Does Keyleth have an action?

223
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,680
 Right now, the two of
you can make an action.

224
00:05:47,758 --> 00:05:49,420
 All right, my first action--

225
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,960
I was just pulling
to try and skeet

226
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,840
shoot, and do a sharp shoot
with Bad News to hit that the--

227
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,940
 The undead?

228
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,970
 --undead that
had grappled her--

229
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,460
 Go for it.

230
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,580
 --and try and--

231
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,960
I assume I have to spend a
grit to get him to let go--

232
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,060
to shove him off.

233
00:06:02,975 --> 00:06:03,975
 To shove him off?

234
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:04,766
OK.

235
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,569
You are, because of the
nature of the rapid movement,

236
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:09,189
you have disadvantage
on this attack.

237
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,210
 OK.

238
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,320
 You have that
inspiration, right?

239
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,885
 I still have that
d12 inspiration.

240
00:06:12,985 --> 00:06:13,985
 Oh!

241
00:06:13,485 --> 00:06:15,285
Hey, can we have like
Bigby's hand go voomp?

242
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,190
 Matt?

243
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,690
 Yes.

244
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,240
 Watching this, I'm going
to pull Whisper out, and wait

245
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,640
and watch to see my sister
falling through the air.

246
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,180
And if I see her
falling, I'm going

247
00:06:23,198 --> 00:06:24,951
to throw the dagger at her.

248
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,051
 OK.

249
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,550
She's falling.

250
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,190
 Jessie?

251
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,170
 Down or up?

252
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,130
 Up.

253
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,450
 I'm watching him,
and I'm watching her.

254
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,530
And if she goes--

255
00:06:31,238 --> 00:06:32,238
 OK.

256
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,860
 That doesn't--

257
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,480
 How far away is she from me?

258
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,430
 Right now, she's about--

259
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,455
because she was up 30
feet out from the ravine,

260
00:06:38,555 --> 00:06:41,330
and now tilting upwards,
she's about 50 feet from you.

261
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,430
 50 feet from me?

262
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:43,249
 50 feet from you.

263
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,720
 Because he's on the
other side, correct?

264
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,210
 If you bamf out--

265
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,330
 Oh, for fuck sake, really?

266
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,940
 --don't do it.

267
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,350
Because then you really--

268
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,450
 Nothing?

269
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,380
 Worse than nothing. --won't
be able to do anything.

270
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,730
 Misfire?

271
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,080
 Misfire.

272
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,640
 That's not true.

273
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,800
 Keyleth's going to go.

274
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,655
Seeing Percy misfire, Keyleth is
going to grab a grasping vine--

275
00:06:56,755 --> 00:06:58,315
 Fucking cleric
right now while this--

276
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,738
 --on the side of the wall,
and she's going to go for that

277
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:01,838
broom.

278
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,540
 OK.

279
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,570
 Because both Pike and her are
still grabbing on to the broom,

280
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,450
yeah?

281
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,200
 And I'm throwing Whisper Vex.

282
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,300
 OK.

283
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
 I'm doing it.

284
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,050
 The vine, unfortunately,
only has a range of 30 feet.

285
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,060
 She's not-- you said
she was 30 feet away!

286
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,580
 She's 30 feet out-- like
in the center of the ravine,

287
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,250
and is now 15, 20
feet up in the air.

288
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,540
 Can she not hit the wall--

289
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,120
get a vine off the
side of the wall?

290
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,230
 On the opposite side?

291
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,423
Maybe.

292
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:25,523
I am holding--

293
00:07:25,106 --> 00:07:27,210
 I've got like a 60-foot
range for this spell--

294
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,310
 --the tether.

295
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,530
 --plus the 30 feet from
the grasping vine, right?

296
00:07:28,963 --> 00:07:30,603
 You're holding--
oh, are they tethered?

297
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,720
 Or is it 30 and 30?

298
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,576
 No, we're not
tethered to that.

299
00:07:32,676 --> 00:07:33,916
 They just fucking went for it.

300
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,550
 I thought you
were still grabbing

301
00:07:33,962 --> 00:07:34,962
on to the tether to the--

302
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:35,990
 I'm tethered to the broom.

303
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:36,970
 --to the broom.

304
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,710
To the broom?

305
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:38,415
Oh, you're tethered
to the broom?

306
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:39,587
And Pike is still grabbing
on to the broom, yeah?

307
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:39,421
Yeah, that's what I mean.

308
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,400
Don't Whisper, because
the broom won't

309
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,920
be able to support
me, you, and Pike.

310
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
 I'm going for the broom.

311
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:44,053
 You've roped the broom.

312
00:07:44,094 --> 00:07:45,094
All right, never mind.

313
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:45,532
 Ah!

314
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:46,174
Come on, man!

315
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,915
 All right.

316
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,779
 [LAUGHS]

317
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,359
 Look, I'm trying
to work over the--

318
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,540
I'm letting you guys do a
lot of things really fast.

319
00:07:53,587 --> 00:07:54,587
 That's insane.

320
00:07:54,253 --> 00:07:55,253
 (SCREAMING) Ah!

321
00:07:54,986 --> 00:07:55,986
 I'm trying--

322
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,290
 I have six more moves
I want to make right now.

323
00:07:57,371 --> 00:07:58,450
 I'm working with you.

324
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,370
So please bear with me on this.

325
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,470
 Fuck yes.

326
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:01,970
Yes.

327
00:08:01,465 --> 00:08:02,465
Yes.

328
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,960
 Grasping vine!

329
00:08:02,255 --> 00:08:03,255
What?

330
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,550
What?

331
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,584
 You're like a loan officer.

332
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,044
 I wouldn't
recommend doing that.

333
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,740
I won't give you a
chance to even do it.

334
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,340
 No lincolning.

335
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,740
No lincolning.

336
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,210
 Oh no!

337
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,490
 Don't taunt the DM.

338
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:11,227
 I want to sell you
this house, but there's

339
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,540
some things we need to go over.

340
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:13,591
 Shh!

341
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,715
 So I'm going to
ask you, Keyleth--

342
00:08:16,815 --> 00:08:17,815
 Yeah?

343
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:21,840
 --to go ahead and make just
a general dexterity check.

344
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,940
 Oh shit.

345
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,890
 Just general dex?

346
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,990
 Yes.

347
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,070
 What?

348
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,210
 This is how fast you're
able to chant a spell, which

349
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:34,070
requires an incantation and the
release of the spell's effect,

350
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,410
thus summoning the vine
and causing it to lash out.

351
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,176
This is just a base DC.

352
00:08:38,276 --> 00:08:40,076
I need you to go ahead
and just roll and add

353
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:42,470
your dexterity modifier.

354
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,570
 You got it.

355
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,170
You got this.

356
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,370
 I love you.

357
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:46,310
 I love you.

358
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,410
 Ooh!

359
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,170
That was a natural 18.

360
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:53,230
So that is plus my dex,
which is plus 2, so 21.

361
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,330
Ha!

362
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,830
 OK.

363
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,330
With that, a vine--

364
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:56,226
 Don't ha!

365
00:08:55,725 --> 00:08:56,725
Don't ha!

366
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,300
Don't taunt the GM!

367
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
 What are you doing?

368
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,020
Stop rubbing it in his face--

369
00:08:58,068 --> 00:08:59,068
 Shu-- I mean, huh!

370
00:08:58,957 --> 00:08:59,957
 --for fuck's sake!

371
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,790
 Huh!

372
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,684
 So as Bad News misfires.

373
00:09:04,784 --> 00:09:07,144
You watch as the front of it
just [EXPLOSION NOISE] --this

374
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,400
burst of black smoke
bursts outward,

375
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,805
and this look of utter
horror on Percy's face--

376
00:09:13,905 --> 00:09:17,630
Keyleth rushes out, and grabbing
the edge of the end of the rope

377
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,520
bridge to get enough
of a reach out there,

378
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,700
you watch as her hair lifts
up and part of her body

379
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,590
begins to just drift upward.

380
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,730
But she holds on, and
reaches out with the staff,

381
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,040
using the strength
of her force of will.

382
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,064
The edge of the stone above
the ravine cracks open--

383
00:09:31,164 --> 00:09:32,164
[CRACKING NOISE]

384
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,270
And suddenly, you
watch where there

385
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,760
is no life, a piercing flash
of dark green shoots outward.

386
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,120
A vine, freshly grown from
the edge of the stonework,

387
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,460
reaches out and grabs, wrapping
around the broom itself

388
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,530
and holding it taught.

389
00:09:44,446 --> 00:09:46,910
You watch as the vine and the
entire group kind of fwooshes

390
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,410
upward.

391
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,770
You're suddenly pulled!

392
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,420
You're still grappled by this
undead zombie-like corpse.

393
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,050
And Pike is currently clutching
onto the broom as hard

394
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,400
as you can, as you
both impact at the end.
