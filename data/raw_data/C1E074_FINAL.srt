00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,066
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:05,066 --> 00:00:09,765
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around, roll dice and
play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. This week, not in

3
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:18,045
costume, to the joy of all of my players. So
welcome back. We're going to hop in here in a

4
00:00:18,045 --> 00:00:21,329
moment, but first, let's get through our
announcements. First and foremost, this week's

5
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:23,895
sponsor is the continuation of Loot Crate being
our awesome sponsor.

6
00:00:23,895 --> 00:00:26,087
(cheering)

7
00:00:26,087 --> 00:00:30,962
MATT: Thank you so much Loot Crate. I think we
announced the new theme for this month's loot

8
00:00:30,962 --> 00:00:34,035
crate last week, but Sam, if you would like to
give us a couple of words on our sponsor, please.

9
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:40,510
SAM: I am running out of things to say. So
instead, I composed a little song, and I thought

10
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,614
that Miss Ashley Johnson could help me with it.

11
00:00:43,614 --> 00:00:44,607
ASHLEY: Okay?

12
00:00:44,607 --> 00:00:50,322
SAM: I'm going to sing a couple of lines, and it
will be very apparent what the rhyming word is,

13
00:00:50,322 --> 00:00:54,479
and you chime in with that. Little known fact,
Ashley Johnson, beautiful singing voice, she's a

14
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:55,541
soprano.

15
00:00:55,541 --> 00:01:02,129
ASHLEY: I am! Yes, and?

16
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:07,800
SAM: Here's a song for Loot Crate. Okay. Ashley, I
need you to focus here. It's to the tune of the

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:14,317
Beverly Hillbillies. (singing) Well, yeehaw for
nerd swag, let's all give a big hoot. You get a

18
00:01:14,317 --> 00:01:16,803
pretty crate and they fill it with--

19
00:01:16,803 --> 00:01:17,794
ASHLEY: Loot!

20
00:01:17,794 --> 00:01:24,769
SAM: Very good! (singing) With gear and apparel
that'll make you look real cute. You'll even be

21
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:26,729
attractive when your butt makes a--

22
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:28,136
ASHLEY: Toot!

23
00:01:28,136 --> 00:01:34,673
SAM: Very good. (singing) Subscribe with the link
that pops up on your computer. With the dough that

24
00:01:34,673 --> 00:01:36,537
you saved, buy some hot wings at--

25
00:01:36,537 --> 00:01:38,024
ASHLEY: Hooters!

26
00:01:38,024 --> 00:01:44,148
SAM: Very good. (singing) You'll be all hot and
bothered even if you're spayed or neutered. So

27
00:01:44,148 --> 00:01:46,711
pull down your skirt, and stick that loot in
your--

28
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:47,817
ASHLEY: Cooter!

29
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,688
SAM: No! It's in your crate. You put your loot in
your crate.

30
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:51,238
ASHLEY: Oh, sorry.

31
00:01:51,238 --> 00:01:53,674
SAM: That's disgusting. That's disgusting, Ashley.
Jesus!

32
00:01:53,674 --> 00:01:55,070
MATT: That's really inappropriate.

33
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,665
SAM: Jesus, why would you stick it in your
cooter?

34
00:01:57,665 --> 00:01:59,759
ASHLEY: It made all the sense.

35
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,288
SAM: Holy shit!

36
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:11,886

everyone. Sign up and use the exclusive promo

40
00:02:25,735 --> 00:02:28,561
SAM: Go check it out guys. I'm done.

41
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:30,356
LIAM: Sam Riegel, you are against the law.

42
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:32,359
TRAVIS: The code is only good for 48 hours.

43
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:35,092
SAM: Wait, is that true?

44
00:02:35,092 --> 00:02:37,163
TRAVIS: It is true. 48 hours only.

45
00:02:37,163 --> 00:02:38,579
SAM: I should read these before I do the ads.

46
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:40,615
TRAVIS: CHAOTICGOOD!

47
00:02:40,615 --> 00:02:45,479
MATT: Thank you, Sam; I appreciate it. Ashley, you
really need to clean that mouth.

48
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:48,092
ASHLEY: You know, there is only one place to put
loot.

49
00:02:48,092 --> 00:02:51,718
MATT: Really, keep it in your crate, guys, highly
recommended.

50
00:02:51,718 --> 00:02:53,979
TALIESIN, LAURA, and ASHLEY: Keep it in your
crate.

51
00:02:53,979 --> 00:03:05,194
MATT: #keepitinyourcrate. So yes. Thank you Loot
Crate for being our awesome sponsor. Other

52
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:10,317
announcements: BlizzCon this weekend! For those
who are going to be there, a number of us are

53
00:03:10,317 --> 00:03:13,352
going to be there. There are panels Friday. Who is
going to be there Friday?

54
00:03:13,352 --> 00:03:14,805
LIAM: Friday! There.

55
00:03:14,805 --> 00:03:19,004
MATT: There you go. Me and Liam will be there
Friday. A number of other of us will be wandering

56
00:03:19,004 --> 00:03:20,175
the halls.

57
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:21,767
TRAVIS: I will be in the bathrooms.

58
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:23,634
LAURA: Just hanging out.

59
00:03:23,634 --> 00:03:27,068
MATT: Just chilling. Just looking to massage folks
as they come in? Taking tips?

60
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:30,121
TRAVIS: Ask if they need their hands dried.

61
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:36,537
MATT: So look for that at BlizzCon. Those of us
who have our schedules and have posted them on our

62
00:03:36,537 --> 00:03:39,169
twitter, and will probably post it tomorrow as
well, so keep an eye out. Hope to see you guys

63
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:46,112
there. Also, new GM Tips went up today, on
YouTube. You guys can check it out; it's every

64
00:03:46,112 --> 00:03:50,997
week Wednesday on Alpha and then Thursday on
YouTube. This week's episode deals with trying to

65
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:55,664
get your players to engage more in actual
roleplaying, in-character in your sessions. So go

66
00:03:55,664 --> 00:04:00,341
ahead and check it out. Hopefully it will be
helpful for some of you new and old GMs out there.

67
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:05,837
And let us know what you think. Also, Marisha, if
you want to talk about the new Spotify playlists

68
00:04:05,837 --> 00:04:07,280
that we have coming up here.

69
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,311
MARISHA: Oh yeah! We did those awesome playlists
like a year ago, and if you didn't know, by the

70
00:04:13,311 --> 00:04:19,929
way, we did playlists about a year ago, each one
of us, for our characters. You should go and check

71
00:04:19,929 --> 00:04:22,817
them out. They are deep somewhere in the Geek and
Sundry website.

72
00:04:22,817 --> 00:04:24,290
LAURA: What's this?

73
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,252
MARISHA: Our Spotify playlists.

74
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:27,498
LAURA: Dude, they were so good!

75
00:04:27,498 --> 00:04:28,647
MARISHA: They were really good!

76
00:04:28,647 --> 00:04:30,472
LAURA: And they give really good background into
our characters.

77
00:04:30,472 --> 00:04:35,754
MARISHA: Yeah, they actually give a lot of
insight, if you pay attention. So yeah! Go look at

78
00:04:35,754 --> 00:04:42,411
our playlists, because we are going to be doing a
round two, starting next week. Because it has been

79
00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:44,949
like 50 some odd episodes, and a lot of shit has
happened.

80
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:48,897
TRAVIS: Mine is just going to be animal noises.
(braying)

81
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:51,636
LAURA: What animal was that?

82
00:04:51,636 --> 00:04:55,719
TRAVIS: You wish you knew. Check out the playlist
to find out!

83
00:04:55,719 --> 00:04:59,547
LIAM: It's just 12 tracks of whale song? (whale
song)

84
00:04:59,547 --> 00:05:03,362
(whale songs)

85
00:05:03,362 --> 00:05:06,980
LIAM: (Grog impersonation) This is me when I'm
sad. This is me when I'm happy.

86
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,797
TRAVIS: He found a tape recorder.

87
00:05:09,797 --> 00:05:15,598
MATT: It is all Sesame Street. All the time. All
right, well, awesome! Keep an eye out for that.

88
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:19,692
Starting next week, we will have info available on
the Geek &amp; Sundry website and our Twitter, as soon

89
00:05:19,692 --> 00:05:25,037
as that becomes available. Anything else that
anyone wants to announce? So glad you could be

90
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:26,362
here with us this week, Ashley!

91
00:05:26,362 --> 00:05:28,111
(cheering)

92
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:31,142
ASHLEY: Very spur of the moment. That's it.

93
00:05:31,142 --> 00:05:33,540
(laughter)

94
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,033
SAM: Are we going to do this thing at the break?
Is that happening? What are we going to do?

95
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:38,220
LAURA: Yes!

96
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,191
TALIESIN: Oh, that thing.

97
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:47,137
LAURA: So our critical costumes contest. We are
announcing the winners after the break!

98
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:48,859
LIAM: After we choose them on the break.

99
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:53,284
LAURA: No, we have all been looking at them. We
all have our personals, but now we have to fight

100
00:05:53,284 --> 00:05:55,314
amongst ourselves and duke it out for the winner.

101
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,987
ASHLEY: We need to fight. We are having a real
battle.

102
00:05:57,987 --> 00:05:59,194
TRAVIS: We have Nerf Guns.

103
00:05:59,194 --> 00:06:00,647
MARISHA: And Jello.

104
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:01,944
TALIESIN: And sticks!

105
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,118
TRAVIS: You brought Jello?

106
00:06:03,118 --> 00:06:06,961
MATT: It is going to be fantastic. For the record:
You guys are ridiculous!

107
00:06:06,961 --> 00:06:08,225
LAURA: They are amazing!

108
00:06:08,225 --> 00:06:10,343
MATT: Those costume entries, every single one was
amazing!

109
00:06:10,343 --> 00:06:11,441
MARISHA: Yes.

110
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:12,307
TALIESIN: Cats.

111
00:06:12,307 --> 00:06:13,842
MATT: There were cats in costume!

112
00:06:13,842 --> 00:06:15,080
LAURA: Victor cat!

113
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,142
MATT: I can't even.

114
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,556
TALIESIN: Scanlan cat.

115
00:06:17,556 --> 00:06:22,352
ASHLEY: Can we do one with just animals, sometime?
Like during the Westminster Dog Show?

116
00:06:22,352 --> 00:06:23,781
TALIESIN: Just cats! Critical Cats!

117
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:25,248
LAURA: Critter Critters!

118
00:06:25,248 --> 00:06:34,301
MATT: We have already lost control. This has
already gone. We are over it. We have peaked. We

119
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:35,399
are done.

120
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:41,899
TRAVIS: Also Talks. Talks Machina will be live
every Tuesday at 7:00pm on Alpha. Every week,

121
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:44,693
there will be like two to three of us on there,
answering questions, giving insight.

122
00:06:44,693 --> 00:06:46,078
LAURA: When does it start?

123
00:06:46,078 --> 00:06:47,100
TRAVIS: November...

124
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,852
ALL: 15th!

125
00:06:48,852 --> 00:06:53,968
TRAVIS: It will be on there, and you can find out
all of the juicy details, who Grog is really in

126
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:59,843
love with. And you can follow @talksmachina on
(shouts) Twitter! There are so many cool things!

127
00:06:59,843 --> 00:07:02,547
There will be gift giveaways and all sorts of
stuff.

128
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,840
MARISHA: Yay.

129
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,300
MATT: Thank you, Travis! It's exciting.

130
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,618
MARISHA: It's fun.

131
00:07:08,618 --> 00:07:12,850
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's going to be fun. We are going
to haze Brian Foster every single week.

132
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,134
MARISHA: Oh no, he hazes us, man.

133
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,796
TALIESIN: Yeah, it was kind of intense.

134
00:07:16,796 --> 00:07:21,511
LIAM: He's an OG D&amp;D player, though, right? Like
decades of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

135
00:07:21,511 --> 00:07:23,036
LAURA: Yeah, he's old school. He's old school.

136
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:27,690
LIAM: Always checking me in my rolls, on my
choices in the game.

137
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,561
LAURA: He's off-camera laughing at us.

138
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:38,956
LIAM: Who I talk to on any given afternoon. It is
all I hear about. I'll do what I want, Brian! It's

139
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:40,068
D&amp;D!

140
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:44,395
MATT: So you can look forward to more of that on
Talks Machina.

141
00:07:44,395 --> 00:07:47,004
TALIESIN: D&amp;D: there's no wrong way to play except
our way.

142
00:07:47,004 --> 00:07:48,590
MARISHA: Yeah.

143
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:56,281
MATT: Indeed. Well then, on that note, let's go
and bring us onto the happy day-glo lives of Vox

144
00:07:56,281 --> 00:08:01,172
Machina right now, and Exandria, as we step into
tonight's episode of Critical Role

145
00:08:01,172 --> 00:08:04,797
TALIESIN: Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle, friendship!

146
00:08:04,797 --> 00:09:35,669
[dramatic music]

147
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:42,416
MATT: Hello, and welcome back. While we were away,
we learned much about the anatomy of the basilisk.

148
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,362
Thank you, Liam.

149
00:09:44,362 --> 00:09:45,677
LIAM: Welcome!

150
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:52,163
MATT: All right. So bringing us into tonight's
episode. Vox Machina, in their attempt to take

151
00:09:52,163 --> 00:10:00,078
down the Chroma Conclave, have slain three of the
five dragons. They've made a tentative alliance

152
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:09,042
with a fourth: Raishan, the Diseased Deceiver, in
the hopes of taking down the fifth, and most

153
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:15,633
powerful master of the entire Conclave: Thordak,
the Cinder King, who currently resides over the

154
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:21,791
now elementally corrupt city of Emon, with the
ground itself beginning to boil and crack with

155
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:28,919
fire elemental energy. You all sit within
Whitestone, deciding upon the coming rush to the

156
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:36,921
final battle, considering what allies you have at
your disposal, what locations you want to put this

157
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:41,910
battle in. You've had these conversations. You've
revealed Raishan to the rest of your allies within

158
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:47,426
Whitestone, and you've previously spoke about
taking this to Fort Daxio to the north of Emon.

159
00:10:47,426 --> 00:10:53,204
And that was where we last left off. As you finish
your conversation with the rest of your current

160
00:10:53,204 --> 00:11:00,107
temporary council on the ziggurat beneath
Whitestone, you've made the choice of Fort Daxio

161
00:11:00,107 --> 00:11:06,513
as being your next grounds of conflict. What do
you wish to do?

162
00:11:06,513 --> 00:11:08,306
(laughter)

163
00:11:08,306 --> 00:11:13,483
SAM: You think we finished our conversation,
but we have about an hour of more talking to do.

164
00:11:13,483 --> 00:11:16,635
(laughter)

165
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:20,424
MARISHA: What if we get an airship, and put the
ziggurat inside of it?

166
00:11:20,424 --> 00:11:21,784
SAM: Oh, okay!

167
00:11:21,784 --> 00:11:24,145
LAURA and TALIESIN: What?

168
00:11:24,145 --> 00:11:25,948
ASHLEY: I have an idea!

169
00:11:25,948 --> 00:11:28,579
(laughter)

170
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:32,465
LAURA: We should go to Fort Daxio then. And talk
to them.

171
00:11:32,465 --> 00:11:37,173
SAM: Did we need to send word to all of our allies
that that is where we are going? Has that been

172
00:11:37,173 --> 00:11:38,634
done already?

173
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:40,915
MARISHA: I feel we need to scout the location
first?

174
00:11:40,915 --> 00:11:45,709
TALIESIN: Let's scout first, let's head there and
then if everything seems copacetic.

175
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:47,683
SAM: How do we get there?

176
00:11:47,683 --> 00:11:49,659
TALIESIN: By airship!

177
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:52,576
LAURA: By the fabulous Keyleth.

178
00:11:52,576 --> 00:11:55,912
MARISHA: Let me scry, then we will bamf through a
tree. Sound good?

179
00:11:55,912 --> 00:11:59,052
LAURA: Can you scry here though? We are by the Orb
of Death.

180
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,819
MARISHA: No, we have to go.

181
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:03,113
SAM: Hold on! Let me go get Pike.

182
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:04,416
MARISHA: Yes!

183
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,064
SAM: I got her, guys! She's here!

184
00:12:07,064 --> 00:12:09,045
ASHLEY: Hey! Oh man!

185
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:13,410
TRAVIS: Oh, Pike. Good to see you. High five!

186
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,621
SAM: Wow! We almost left without her.

187
00:12:15,621 --> 00:12:17,503
ASHLEY: Wait, so he said we were going to Fort
Daxio?

188
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,090
LAURA: Yeah. We are totally going to Fort Daxio.

189
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,423
ASHLEY: Okay! That sounds--

190
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:23,157
LAURA: That's where we are going to amass our
forces. Potentially.

191
00:12:23,157 --> 00:12:29,064
ASHLEY: I think it is a great idea. On our walk,
we talked about it, and I think that it is a

192
00:12:29,064 --> 00:12:30,482
really good idea.

193
00:12:30,482 --> 00:12:31,834
TRAVIS: The Monstah has spoken.

194
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,903
SAM: Now it's unanimous.

195
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:35,715
LIAM: Sure.

196
00:12:35,715 --> 00:12:41,200
SAM: Wait, can she scry? Do you need to scry? Do
we have scrying things?

197
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,324
MARISHA: I can scry. Yeah. I got my Scry Ball.

198
00:12:44,324 --> 00:12:45,997
MATT: Who are you scrying?

199
00:12:45,997 --> 00:12:50,846
MARISHA: I am-- Do we know someone in Fort Daxio?

200
00:12:50,846 --> 00:12:51,937
TALIESIN: We do! We do.

201
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,415
LAURA: We do?

202
00:12:53,415 --> 00:12:54,788
TALIESIN: Because your--

203
00:12:54,788 --> 00:12:57,582
LAURA: My shit father?

204
00:12:57,582 --> 00:12:59,677
TALIESIN: Yeah, your shit father.

205
00:12:59,677 --> 00:13:01,408
LAURA: Yeah, he knew somebody there, but I don't
remember who it was.

206
00:13:01,408 --> 00:13:02,733
TALIESIN: Oh, shit. Hold on.

207
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:11,943
SAM: But wait! Anyone from like when we were with
the 'fugees? The refugee camp? Didn't some of them

208
00:13:11,943 --> 00:13:13,042
go to Daxio?

209
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:21,521
LAURA: Oh! Oh! What about that guy that was
running the refugee camp? The leader! Bernard, or

210
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:22,677
Reginald, or--

211
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,549
MARISHA: Well, Reginald is dead.

212
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:25,810
LAURA: Not Reginald.

213
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:31,055
TALIESIN: Most of our friends are dead, let's be
fair.

214
00:13:31,055 --> 00:13:32,753
LIAM: Yeah, we have met a lot of dead people.

215
00:13:32,753 --> 00:13:37,412
LAURA: What was his name? Bernard?

216
00:13:37,412 --> 00:13:39,783
MATT: Who are you referring to?

217
00:13:39,783 --> 00:13:43,751
LAURA: The guy who was running the refugee camp
that was like a blacksmith, not a blacksmith, but

218
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:46,292
he had stepped up to--

219
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,461
SAM: Wait! Rothfuss?

220
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:48,382
LAURA: No.

221
00:13:48,382 --> 00:13:49,730
LIAM: No. I know who you're talking about.

222
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,308
LAURA: Yeah. We found his brother? His son?

223
00:13:53,308 --> 00:13:56,467
LIAM: When we left the orc camp, and we headed out
into the snow--

224
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:57,446
MATT: Oh!

225
00:13:57,446 --> 00:14:00,480
LIAM: It was close to when we found Tyriok
without an arm.

226
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,339
LAURA: They were heading to Fort Daxio, weren't
they?

227
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:05,878
MATT: I don't recall if they were heading to Fort
Daxio.

228
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,525
MARISHA: This was after the goliaths?

229
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:08,753
LAURA: Yeah.

230
00:14:08,753 --> 00:14:11,972
SAM: This is the part of the show where we look
through our notes.

231
00:14:11,972 --> 00:14:16,762
LIAM: It's D&amp;D! It is a Dungeons &amp; Dragons game.

232
00:14:16,762 --> 00:14:18,888
TRAVIS: You guys actually write notes? I just draw
pictures.

233
00:14:18,888 --> 00:14:20,998
TALIESIN: They write notes. I draw pictures.

234
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:22,421
LIAM: I listen to them read their notes.

235
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:23,516
TRAVIS: Oh, good.

236
00:14:23,516 --> 00:14:25,301
ASHLEY: I look over her shoulder and read her
notes.

237
00:14:25,301 --> 00:14:26,879
LAURA: Well, they're empty right now.

238
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,501
SAM: Mine are terrible! Arbiter Brom?

239
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:32,233
MATT: No!

240
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:35,242
SAM: Tristan the cleric? Gern Blanston?

241
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:38,012
(laughter)

242
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:39,553
SAM: Spireling Shenn?

243
00:14:39,553 --> 00:14:41,827
TRAVIS: Orc skull?

244
00:14:41,827 --> 00:14:47,827
LAURA: But you know who I'm talking about. Yeah?

245
00:14:47,827 --> 00:14:51,095
MATT: This will be Cornelius. Maybe? I'm trying
to--

246
00:14:51,095 --> 00:14:52,009
TALIESIN: Wow!

247
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:53,936
TRAVIS and LAURA: Cornelius.

248
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:58,497
SAM: Oh wait! I got it, I got my page! Cornelius!
Leader of the refugees. He is a bookbinder. Drez

249
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:06,252
Vena! Magic guy. Elowen, the mom. Simon, the son.
These are people who were in Daxio, right?

250
00:15:06,252 --> 00:15:08,186
MATT: No, these are people who were sent to
Kymal.

251
00:15:08,186 --> 00:15:10,451
SAM: Shit balls! Master Quall?

252
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,411
MATT: Also Kymal. Or Westruun. One of the two.

253
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:16,700
MARISHA: Do we not know anybody at Fort Daxio?

254
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,721
MATT: No one that you know of. Fort Daxio--

255
00:15:19,721 --> 00:15:21,713
LAURA: Is Allura still here? Is Allura still
around?

256
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:22,721
MATT: Allura is still around.

257
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,418
LAURA: Allura, do you know anyone in Fort Daxio?

258
00:15:24,418 --> 00:15:34,127
MATT: "Unfortunately, the one member I know is the
Warmaster, Mikael Daxio, the father of Riskel. But

259
00:15:34,127 --> 00:15:38,295
"as far as I know, he is currently sealed off in
Syngorn with the rest of the army."

260
00:15:38,295 --> 00:15:42,733
LAURA: Right. Shit.

261
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:47,256
MARISHA: Okay, hang on, wait. Is Fort Daxio near
Syngorn?

262
00:15:47,256 --> 00:15:52,732
LAURA: No. The army, remember, part of the army
got sent to Syngorn, and then Syngorn bamfed

263
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:53,652
away.

264
00:15:53,652 --> 00:16:04,457
MATT: Yeah. Three of the regiments in Fort Daxio
were sent to Syngorn, with the supposed dragon

265
00:16:04,457 --> 00:16:10,368
incursion in the Stormcrest Mountains. Most of
them went with Syngorn when it got pulled back to

266
00:16:10,368 --> 00:16:14,803
the Feywild, and one regiment still remains at
Fort Daxio. Fort Daxio is north of Emon.

267
00:16:14,803 --> 00:16:23,748
MARISHA: Are there any guards from Emon here?
Because the guards were also the guards from Emon

268
00:16:23,748 --> 00:16:32,160
went to Syngorn. So maybe someone in one of the
guards knows one of the guards in Fort Daxio.

269
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,315
LAURA: This is a lot of work.

270
00:16:34,315 --> 00:16:36,999
MARISHA: Yeah. Is there an easier way to go about
this?

271
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:38,721
MATT: You could ask around?

272
00:16:38,721 --> 00:16:42,702
MARISHA: I am going to go and see if I can find
one of the Whitestone guards.

273
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,205
MATT: Make an investigation check.

274
00:16:44,205 --> 00:16:52,810
MARISHA: Oh! I am not good at these. I think that
it's a 12; let me double check my investigation.

275
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,747
I don't do this a whole lot. Yeah, 12.

276
00:16:54,747 --> 00:17:02,176
MATT: Okay. You spend the next 30 minutes asking
around for various guards, and the few that you do

277
00:17:02,176 --> 00:17:09,522
know that are from Emon are like, "I don't really
know anyone from Daxio. It's very regimented. I

278
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:14,666
"wasn't interested in the military, I wanted to
more sit around the city and get paid to wear armor."

279
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:18,464
MARISHA: So they're more militant? Or like, the
army?

280
00:17:18,464 --> 00:17:20,046
MATT: "It is where the military is, yeah."

281
00:17:20,046 --> 00:17:22,488
MARISHA: You don't have any army friends? Are
there any army friends here?

282
00:17:22,488 --> 00:17:25,714
MATT: "I think there are a few here that at least
might know that, but I am not one of them. Sorry."

283
00:17:25,714 --> 00:17:27,761
MARISHA: Where? Where? Point me.

284
00:17:27,761 --> 00:17:29,607
MATT: (shouting) I don't know! That way!

285
00:17:29,607 --> 00:17:31,448
MARISHA: (shouting) All right! I go that way!

286
00:17:31,448 --> 00:17:37,687
MATT: Keyleth spends the better part of the next
hour or so without luck, unable to really find

287
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:39,575
anyone to match the description from before.

288
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:41,108
MARISHA: Guys, this sucks! We don't know anyone in
Daxio!

289
00:17:41,108 --> 00:17:42,387
LAURA: Should we just fucking go there?

290
00:17:42,387 --> 00:17:45,971
LIAM: This is like when you're on a level in a
video game, and you run around and around and

291
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:48,822
around. You can't find that thing that triggers to
the next section of the video game.

292
00:17:48,822 --> 00:17:52,709
SAM: Wait, Gilmore knows everybody. He must know
someone in Daxio.

293
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:54,714
LAURA: I don't know if he knows army people.

294
00:17:54,714 --> 00:17:56,956
LIAM: Well, he knows a lot of people.

295
00:17:56,956 --> 00:18:00,724
MARISHA: All right. If Gilmore doesn't know
anybody, then we are going to the nearest

296
00:18:00,724 --> 00:18:01,991
location, and then we're hoofing it.

297
00:18:01,991 --> 00:18:03,387
LAURA: Yeah.

298
00:18:03,387 --> 00:18:04,982
SAM: Kraghammer is near-ish.

299
00:18:04,982 --> 00:18:06,775
MARISHA: All right, let's go talk to Gilmore.

300
00:18:06,775 --> 00:18:08,168
LAURA: That's true.

301
00:18:08,168 --> 00:18:14,201
MATT: Okay. As the rest of your council has
essentially scattered throughout Whitestone Castle

302
00:18:14,201 --> 00:18:18,574
since your meeting, Gilmore is easy to find,
beginning to make his way out of the castle down

303
00:18:18,574 --> 00:18:23,799
towards his homestead, and prepare what he has for
the coming struggle. So as you intercept him

304
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:28,042
walking down the outside, he says: "Oh, hi! I'm
sorry. What did you need?"

305
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:33,051
SAM: Do you know anyone in Fort Daxio? Please say
yes.

306
00:18:33,051 --> 00:18:39,856
MATT: (chuckles, sighs) "You know, I believe I
have had a couple of people come through my

307
00:18:39,856 --> 00:18:41,027
"establishment."

308
00:18:41,027 --> 00:18:45,702
TRAVIS: Is that what they call it? "Come through
my establishment?"

309
00:18:45,702 --> 00:18:47,700
TALIESIN: Yes, that is exactly what they call it
when you have an establishment.

310
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,072
MATT: "That is actually exactly what they call
it, Grog."

311
00:18:51,072 --> 00:18:59,929
MARISHA: I mean, we don't necessarily need to know
anybody if you happen to know a very fast way to

312
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:01,126
get to Daxio.

313
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:06,679
MATT: "I mean, there are magics that can get a
person there quickly, but--"

314
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:14,360
LAURA: Are there trees? Are there lots of trees?
It's grassland.

315
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,660
LIAM: Shaun, could you send one of us there? Is
that possible by any chance?

316
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,125
MATT: "Let me think."

317
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,677
LAURA: One? Why one?

318
00:19:20,677 --> 00:19:26,418
LIAM: Because if one of us goes with the
Gatestone, Keyleth can jump over, she can see

319
00:19:26,418 --> 00:19:30,251
trees there, she can tree her way back here. I
mean, I don't know; I'm spitballing.

320
00:19:30,251 --> 00:19:31,895
LAURA: It seems like a really long process--

321
00:19:31,895 --> 00:19:33,793
LIAM: Yeah, all right. Where's your great idea?

322
00:19:33,793 --> 00:19:40,503
LAURA: Well, one of us goes there, finds a tree
and then bamfs back, and Keyleth brings us all over--

323
00:19:40,503 --> 00:19:43,179
SAM: No, Keyleth can scry on you once you're
there, and see the tree.

324
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:46,830
LAURA: Fabulous. Send one of us over there.

325
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,225
MARISHA: Yeah! Yeah.

326
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:56,567
MATT: He says: "Well, I can't. But Allura might be
able to help with that. Ask her?"

327
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:58,400
MARISHA: All right. Back to Allura.

328
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,879
SAM: (sings Yakety Sax)

329
00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:03,620
LIAM: Chickens with our heads cut off, eh?

330
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,778
TRAVIS: In and out of the doors.

331
00:20:05,778 --> 00:20:08,843
TALIESIN: Like a Monty Python animation. Back and
forth.

332
00:20:08,843 --> 00:20:10,474
MARISHA: Trip three times.

333
00:20:10,474 --> 00:20:17,062
MATT: Exactly. Apparently, Gilmore doesn't seem
to have access to the type of translocation magic

334
00:20:17,062 --> 00:20:18,120
you're asking about.

335
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,242
MARISHA: All right.

336
00:20:19,297 --> 00:20:21,793
MATT: You eventually find your way to Allura in
Whitestone Castle, who is currently having a

337
00:20:21,793 --> 00:20:27,331
conversation with Cassandra. She turns back to
you, and as you ask the same question, she

338
00:20:27,331 --> 00:20:33,867
responds with a: "I actually do have prepared-- I
can bring up to eight other individuals with me."

339
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:35,263
LAURA: Oh! How perfect!

340
00:20:35,263 --> 00:20:39,702
TRAVIS: Wait, wait. One... Somebody else do this.

341
00:20:39,702 --> 00:20:42,042
LAURA: We're good.

342
00:20:42,094 --> 00:20:44,066
ASHLEY: I think we're okay. It's just right.

343
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:46,206
MARISHA: Are you fine doing that?

344
00:20:46,206 --> 00:20:51,517
MATT: "Yes. I can only go there, so we have to
have some way of returning, which I believe you

345
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:53,845
"can handle that. All right?"

346
00:20:53,845 --> 00:20:55,505
MARISHA: I can get us back, yeah.

347
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:58,730
MATT: "All right. Then whenever you are ready, I
suppose."

348
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,080
LAURA: Great.

349
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,454
LIAM: Now's as good a time as any. Yeah.

350
00:21:03,454 --> 00:21:10,080
MATT: "All right, gather round." She puts her arms
out and gestures for you to reach in like a hand circle.

351
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,009
ASHLEY: Come on Grog.

352
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:14,568
SAM: Are we taking Kima?

353
00:21:14,568 --> 00:21:16,589
LAURA: Kima! Can we take Kima?

354
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:17,966
SAM: Do we want to take Kima?

355
00:21:17,966 --> 00:21:21,623
MATT: "Of course! I have to go get her"

356
00:21:21,623 --> 00:21:23,328
LIAM: One too many though, isn't it?

357
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,471
LAURA: No. This is perfect.

358
00:21:24,471 --> 00:21:25,693
LIAM: I swore she said eight. Or eight along with
her?

359
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:27,001
MATT: "Eight along with me."

360
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:28,835
TRAVIS: We're just reconning.

361
00:21:28,835 --> 00:21:30,252
LAURA: Yeah, it's fine. Let's just go.

362
00:21:30,252 --> 00:21:32,310
LIAM: You know, we always take her and leave you.
Why don't we flip that?

363
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:37,629
MATT: "Just don't tell her. She gets a bit testy
when she's not included. All right, very well."

364
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:45,247
She takes your hands. Some of you close your eyes,
some of you don't. That familiar rush of warmth

365
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:47,358
underneath your stomach begins fill--

366
00:21:47,358 --> 00:21:48,726
TRAVIS: (fart noise)

367
00:21:48,736 --> 00:21:53,030
MATT: Your chest cavity... (laughs). Grog poots
out the side and it distracts you momentarily,

368
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:58,065
before you watch the ground beneath you; this line
of blue arcane energy begins to link each one of

369
00:21:58,065 --> 00:22:03,128
your feet together in a circle. As it does, these
star-like extensions begin to appear out in the

370
00:22:03,128 --> 00:22:08,117
center, and as soon as they all meet into one
crystalline structure, there is a flash of light.

371
00:22:08,117 --> 00:22:14,309
Your vision goes white, and as it slowly adjusts
to the daylight, this light breeze soothing you,

372
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:19,832
you look around and see yourselves now standing in
the Othendin Pass, which is this large rocky

373
00:22:19,832 --> 00:22:26,781
ravine that rides up on each side of you to these
tall, cliff side edges of the very very southwest

374
00:22:26,781 --> 00:22:32,705
side of the Cliffkeep Mountains. This is far north
of Emon. While you see the ground itself is very

375
00:22:32,705 --> 00:22:41,013
cracked land, you can see dry and long dead
bushes, you can see bits and pieces of dead trees

376
00:22:41,013 --> 00:22:47,457
that have for a long time been petrified, broken
over or been left without much of an actual

377
00:22:47,457 --> 00:22:54,170
fertile ground to exist in. You glance off to the
eastern side of your direction, and you can see a

378
00:22:54,170 --> 00:23:05,177
very large cluster of reddish-brown trees; a
forest there that has long died, or at least

379
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:13,071
is definitely in the fall season type of color
change. But the vegetation around here is very

380
00:23:13,071 --> 00:23:20,661
sparse, very scrub and in some cases very dry and
dead. You do see to the immediate northwest of

381
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:28,077
your current location, clinging to the side of the
mountain cliff, what you assume is Fort Daxio: a

382
00:23:28,077 --> 00:23:34,317
massive stronghold, built of gray and brown stone,
an outer wall perimeter that completely surrounds

383
00:23:34,317 --> 00:23:39,825
it, buttressed against each side of the cliff, and
within, you can see a multi-tiered fortress

384
00:23:39,825 --> 00:23:44,783
structure within, built specifically for defending
against any sort of army siege or incursion.

385
00:23:44,783 --> 00:23:48,564
LAURA: Wow, that is way bigger than I expected it
to be.

386
00:23:48,564 --> 00:23:50,640
TALIESIN: That's what I'm talking about.

387
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,833
TRAVIS: Can I check the skies? Anything flying
around?

388
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,387
MATT: Make a perception check.

389
00:23:55,387 --> 00:23:59,025
TRAVIS: Hey! This will go well. Three!

390
00:23:59,025 --> 00:24:06,580
MATT: You begin to look up, and you see a small
bird, and it's really small and it'ss really

391
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,891
cute, and your eyes watch it, and you watch it
fling off that way.

392
00:24:08,891 --> 00:24:10,065
TRAVIS: (gasp) Pike!

393
00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:11,438
ASHLEY: Oh lookit.

394
00:24:11,438 --> 00:24:12,449
TRAVIS: What?

395
00:24:12,449 --> 00:24:13,673
ASHLEY: It's a little--

396
00:24:13,673 --> 00:24:14,688
TRAVIS: It's tiny right?

397
00:24:14,688 --> 00:24:15,552
ASHLEY: It's so cute.

398
00:24:15,552 --> 00:24:16,845
TRAVIS: Yeah, he chirps I bet.

399
00:24:16,845 --> 00:24:18,508
ASHLEY: It's a little thorbilly.

400
00:24:18,508 --> 00:24:22,394
(laughter)

401
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:25,961
TRAVIS: Can you make thorbilly land on your finger
like a Disney princess?

402
00:24:25,961 --> 00:24:30,160
ASHLEY: Can I? This is so dumb. Yeah, I'm going
to try.

403
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,076
SAM and TALIESIN: Animal handling check!

404
00:24:33,076 --> 00:24:35,404
MATT: I was going to say. Make an animal handling
check.

405
00:24:35,404 --> 00:24:39,348
LAURA: Wow! Have we ever rolled this?

406
00:24:39,348 --> 00:24:40,653
SAM: One! We have done one.

407
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:41,598
TALIESIN: We have done one?

408
00:24:41,598 --> 00:24:42,703
SAM: One. I don't remember why, or who did it.

409
00:24:42,703 --> 00:24:46,663
LAURA: Oh my God, you've got really good animal
handling!

410
00:24:46,663 --> 00:24:47,964
ASHLEY: Well, all right!

411
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:49,352
TRAVIS: And you rolled a dick.

412
00:24:49,352 --> 00:24:51,161
LAURA: Is it a dick?

413
00:24:51,161 --> 00:24:54,091
ASHLEY: It 's a four. Okay, nine.

414
00:24:54,091 --> 00:24:55,970
MARISHA: That's kind of a dick.

415
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:00,832
MATT: You make three (clunks) clomping plate armor. Pike
steps before the bird--

416
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,468
[no audio]

417
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:04,515
MATT: Into the sky.

418
00:25:04,515 --> 00:25:08,798
ASHLEY: It was a baby thorbilly. They're a little
more shy.

419
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,513
TRAVIS: Yeah, no yeah. He was very scared.

420
00:25:10,513 --> 00:25:11,588
(laughter)

421
00:25:11,588 --> 00:25:12,784
TRAVIS: It's all right. Next time.

422
00:25:12,784 --> 00:25:16,810
LAURA: Does it look like anybody's in the fort
looking down at us? Are we far enough away?

423
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:21,397
MATT: Make a perception check. You're a few
hundred yards away.

424
00:25:21,397 --> 00:25:24,300
LAURA: Fucking shit balls. 16.

425
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:30,929
MATT: 16. Okay. Best you can tell, you do see some
shapes along the top of the outer battlements; the

426
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:37,465
wall that surrounds the structure. However, from
this distance, you're not sure if they have seen

427
00:25:37,465 --> 00:25:38,460
you yet.

428
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,310
LAURA: All right.

429
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,596
LIAM: Best you can tell, it's shit-balls.

430
00:25:40,596 --> 00:25:43,380
LAURA: It's shit-balls up there. Just lots of
shit.

431
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,295
MARISHA: What's a shit-ball?

432
00:25:44,295 --> 00:25:50,356
SAM: Hey, if we walk up to the fort, what's our
cover story?

433
00:25:50,356 --> 00:25:53,809
TALIESIN: No cover story. We tell them who we are
and what we're doing here.

434
00:25:53,809 --> 00:25:56,897
SAM: We're dragon fighters bringing the fight to
their town?

435
00:25:56,897 --> 00:26:00,184
LAURA: We're not bringing the fight here.

436
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:01,674
SAM: We are looking to fight here.

437
00:26:01,674 --> 00:26:04,916
LAURA: Oh shit, we are. That's the plan, that's
my plan

438
00:26:04,961 --> 00:26:06,131
LIAM: It's not a town. It's--

439
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,441
TALIESIN: It's a fort.

440
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:11,503
SAM: Well, whatever it is, I don't think we
should tell them that we're dragon fighters bringing

441
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,733
the fight to their fort.

442
00:26:12,733 --> 00:26:16,511
MARISHA: Well, actually, that's a good point.
Whose fort is this?

443
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:20,508
LAURA: Daxio's, who's in Syngorn. No, it is!

444
00:26:20,508 --> 00:26:24,809
MATT: Well, that is the warmaster, who has been
assigned by Emon. This is technically where the

445
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:27,219
majority of the military of Emon is stationed.

446
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:30,141
MARISHA: So this is Emon's military? Not
Syngorn's.

447
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:32,383
MATT: Yeah, this is Emon's military.

448
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:35,116
LAURA: And we have got Allura with us; she's on
the council.

449
00:26:35,116 --> 00:26:36,469
TALIESIN: And they are at war as well.

450
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,682
ASHLEY: This is already going well.

451
00:26:37,682 --> 00:26:38,916
LIAM: We're protecting the world.

452
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:39,971
LAURA: Super good.

453
00:26:39,971 --> 00:26:41,993
MARISHA: Well, yeah. If this is for Emon, then it's
for Emon.

454
00:26:41,993 --> 00:26:44,448
TALIESIN: This is specifically where you want
things to attack, as opposed to towns.

455
00:26:44,448 --> 00:26:46,891
LAURA: But they might be skittish, so we should
probably have a little protection as we go up there.

456
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:49,450
MARISHA: Do we have any idea on who we're talking
to?

457
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:54,949
LAURA: Dudes. I think their commanding officers
are in Syngorn. For the most part.

458
00:26:54,949 --> 00:26:58,095
TRAVIS: Do we need a white flag as we
approach?

459
00:26:58,095 --> 00:26:59,343
LAURA: Sure.

460
00:26:59,343 --> 00:27:01,132
LIAM: Do you want to hold up Pike, as we walk
closer?

461
00:27:01,132 --> 00:27:02,290
ASHLEY: I can whip my hair.

462
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,842
ALL: (singing) I whip my hair back and forth. I
whip my hair back and forth.

463
00:27:04,842 --> 00:27:08,446
MATT: Yeah, it's 5th-level, you can do that.

464
00:27:08,446 --> 00:27:10,385
(laughter)

465
00:27:10,385 --> 00:27:17,910
MATT: As you guys begin to approach the outside of
Fort Daxio, you can see a number of the figures on

466
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:24,722
the wall beginning to move faster and gathering at
edges. You can see one of a few defensive ballistae

467
00:27:24,722 --> 00:27:31,067
being locked in. Allura begins stepping into the
front, and she puts her hand out and says: "Don't

468
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:33,005
"worry, let me do the talking for this."

469
00:27:33,005 --> 00:27:34,148
SAM: Ooh, okay!

470
00:27:34,148 --> 00:27:41,497
MATT: As you guys begin to approach the gate, you
hear a small horn give off this arrival

471
00:27:41,497 --> 00:27:46,414
notification. This: (pathetic horn noise). But
deeper and much cooler sounding than that.

472
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,464
(laughter)

473
00:27:48,464 --> 00:27:49,723
LIAM: (air horn)

474
00:27:49,723 --> 00:27:52,080
ASHLEY: (air horn)

475
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,366
TRAVIS: Come on, man!

476
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:55,278
MATT and SAM: (air horn)

477
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:56,659
MATT: Because I am not a war horn.

478
00:27:56,659 --> 00:27:57,964
MARISHA: I imagine a kid with a kazoo.

479
00:27:57,964 --> 00:27:59,775
(laughter)

480
00:27:59,775 --> 00:28:00,932
ALL: (kazoo)

481
00:28:00,932 --> 00:28:02,239
TALIESIN: (deep and cool horn)

482
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:03,916
TRAVIS: Of all the sounds you could make!

483
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:06,589
MATT: Fort Daxio is very sparsely run right now.

484
00:28:06,589 --> 00:28:08,612
SAM: All their horns were broken in the war.

485
00:28:08,612 --> 00:28:12,378
MATT: They left the regiment behind with a small
conch shell that is partially broken.

486
00:28:12,378 --> 00:28:14,859
TALIESIN: Piggy's got the conch.

487
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:18,821
LAURA and ASHLEY: (pathetic horn noise)

488
00:28:18,821 --> 00:28:20,825
LIAM: Did we just find your Achilles Heel?

489
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:22,795
MARISHA: Horn noises?

490
00:28:22,795 --> 00:28:26,665
LIAM: Man of a thousand voices: animals,
creatures-- can't do horns.

491
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:27,710
TALIESIN: And no horns.

492
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,888
MATT: (deep and cool horn sound)

493
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:31,349
(cheering)

494
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:34,068
MATT: There you go! To make you happy.

495
00:28:34,068 --> 00:28:35,863
LIAM: I don't do horns; they sicken me.

496
00:28:35,863 --> 00:28:47,706
MATT: That's more hit points on Thordak. Just keep
a tally. All right. As you approach, and begin to

497
00:28:47,706 --> 00:28:52,702
gather and Allura steps forward, she takes a few
more steps and then stops, puts her other hand up

498
00:28:52,702 --> 00:29:01,324
to give you a signal to hold back. She speaks out
across the expanse: "Arcanist Allura Vysoren,

499
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:08,743
"member of the Tal'Dorei Council, here with allies
to speak with who resides within. Will you allow

500
00:29:08,743 --> 00:29:17,994
"us passage?" There's a pause. You hear the sound
of the ballista crank being loosened. And

501
00:29:17,994 --> 00:29:25,030
then you see the two front gates slightly open.
She puts her hands down. "Very well, walk with me."

502
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:32,016
LAURA: They didn't even check us out; just letting
us in. Be on your guard. They're too trusting.

503
00:29:32,016 --> 00:29:34,366
SAM: Okay.

504
00:29:34,366 --> 00:29:41,151
MATT: As you guys approach the gates and begin to
walk through, you can see there is about 15 guards

505
00:29:41,151 --> 00:29:45,620
stationed above the top that all have cocked
crossbows, that are trained on you guys--

506
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,642
LAURA: Never mind!

507
00:29:46,642 --> 00:29:54,116
MATT: Not directly ready to fire, but cautiously
watching you as you progress. Allura leads

508
00:29:54,116 --> 00:29:58,228
through, leading you guys into the main entryway,
and as you walk into this front area, the

509
00:29:58,228 --> 00:30:06,853
pseudo-courtyard or central area between the wall
and the stronghold itself, the same cracked

510
00:30:06,853 --> 00:30:14,410
exterior. But you can see there is a trebuchet
over there. There are countersiege weaponry. Some

511
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:20,170
of it unused for a while and probably in need of
some level of repair. You do see a number of other

512
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:24,233
armored individuals, and the armor you see on the
military stationed here is much more than the

513
00:30:24,233 --> 00:30:28,755
armors of Emon, or any of the local guard that you
are used to. These are very heavy, regimented

514
00:30:28,755 --> 00:30:35,720
plate, tower shields, you can see spears that are
very nasty looking and very strong in

515
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,529
construction. A lot of these almost resemble a lot
of the dwarven make you saw in Kraghammer before.

516
00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:43,571
So whether this is an alliance through Kraghammer
and Emon that came to this, or the design was

517
00:30:43,571 --> 00:30:49,390
borrowed to some extent, a lot of the armor is
more square and bulky than the more refined armor

518
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:56,997
you have seen in more southern areas of the
Tal'Dorei continent. Immediately, as you step in,

519
00:30:56,997 --> 00:31:02,012
while the guards still have their weapons trained
on you on the other side of the wall, you see ten

520
00:31:02,012 --> 00:31:08,473
individuals approaching, armored. You can see
these individuals, their shields are large, heavy

521
00:31:08,473 --> 00:31:14,833
tower shields, with a goldish, circular symbol on
the front that has an inlay that's almost like a

522
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:23,521
polished mirror. Like, a big old oval mirror as
part of the center shield itself. As these armored

523
00:31:23,521 --> 00:31:27,745
individuals approach, one of them in the center
has her helm off, and seems to be leading this

524
00:31:27,745 --> 00:31:35,360
push to greet you at that front. You see a woman, very
stern look, dark skinned, very short ebony hair

525
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:41,239
and a very tough, dour expression on her face as
she quickly brushes up towards the front, and as

526
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:44,862
she steps forward, she slams her shield into the
ground, and gives a nod as the rest of the

527
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:52,285
soldiers stop. She bows her head, and goes:
"Allura. We finally have answer from the council.

528
00:31:52,285 --> 00:32:02,042
"It's been silence for weeks." Allura bows her
head, and says, "Well, General, let me introduce

529
00:32:02,042 --> 00:32:09,465
"you to our allies here. These are Vox Machina.
They are friends. They are--" And the general

530
00:32:09,465 --> 00:32:15,133
breaks once more into the conversation, and says:
"That's fine! So you are here with your allies.

531
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:19,026
"Any word from Mikael? Any word from the rest of
the regiments?"

532
00:32:19,026 --> 00:32:21,583
LAURA: They're in Syngorn.

533
00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:23,471
MATT: "Still? In Syngorn?"

534
00:32:23,471 --> 00:32:25,209
LAURA: As far as we know.

535
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:36,229
MATT: "All right. Well." (sighs) You see the
tension that's been building in her since she

536
00:32:36,229 --> 00:32:44,357
approached you guys begins to slowly fade with this
sense of digesting the difficulty of the

537
00:32:44,357 --> 00:32:54,565
situation. There's an awkward pause and Allura
says, "Can we speak in less--" She looks up at the

538
00:32:54,565 --> 00:33:03,409
rest of the battlements, "--less armed circles, if
you don't mind?" The general looks up and nods.

539
00:33:03,409 --> 00:33:09,419
"Very well. My apologies. I am General Elle
Gorgofon."

540
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:11,192
LAURA: Elle Gorgofon?

541
00:33:11,192 --> 00:33:20,057
MATT: "Elle Gorgofon. I am the commander of the
Aegis Regiment and I welcome you, for the time

542
00:33:20,057 --> 00:33:27,623
"being, to Fort Daxio. Follow me." She turns on her
heel and begins to march at a very brisk pace back

543
00:33:27,623 --> 00:33:33,305
towards the stronghold itself. The other soldiers
turning around as well. Allura gives you all a

544
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:35,403
head nudge to follow suit.

545
00:33:35,403 --> 00:33:41,788
SAM: Okay! Yeah! Let's go. This is going great. We
haven't even done anything wrong yet.

546
00:33:41,788 --> 00:33:43,709
TALIESIN: Give us time.

547
00:33:43,709 --> 00:33:52,766
MATT: As you're walking around, Keyleth, Vex, and
Vax, looking over the number of soldiers that are

548
00:33:52,766 --> 00:34:01,605
here, you have roughly 20 or so you see on the top
of the wall, maybe 25 to 30 that occasionally are

549
00:34:01,605 --> 00:34:08,849
stepping around the base of it or the interior of
this main courtyard. For the entirety of the army

550
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:16,986
of Emon, the regiment that's here, doesn't seem to
be very busy or very well--

551
00:34:16,986 --> 00:34:19,221
MARISHA: Stocked?

552
00:34:19,221 --> 00:34:24,572
MATT: Staffed. There aren't a lot of people here.
This regiment is not extremely large. It looks

553
00:34:24,572 --> 00:34:29,213
like this may be the defensive regiment that was
left behind to guard the fort, when other

554
00:34:29,213 --> 00:34:31,028
regiments are sent out on whatever duties.

555
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:32,440
MARISHA: You said we saw 40?

556
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,596
LAURA: 50 people.

557
00:34:33,596 --> 00:34:35,976
MATT: 40 to 50 soldiers on the outskirts of the
stronghold. You don't know how many are inside

558
00:34:35,976 --> 00:34:37,052
necessarily.

559
00:34:37,052 --> 00:34:38,139
TRAVIS: It's like the Alamo.

560
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:40,366
MATT: It's fairly lightly guarded right now.

561
00:34:40,366 --> 00:34:41,580
TRAVIS: Which ended well.

562
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,272
TALIESIN: It depends on who you ask, really.

563
00:34:44,272 --> 00:34:55,288
MATT: As you guys enter the stronghold, it's
beautiful in its construction. It also looks like

564
00:34:55,288 --> 00:35:03,285
it's been in some level of disrepair. It's
definitely built for function. The furniture and

565
00:35:03,285 --> 00:35:08,458
decor on the interior is very simple, very
pragmatic. It is made for function more than

566
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:13,825
presentation. You're led through two small
hallways to the right to one central chamber where

567
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:19,090
there are a series of benches and chairs, whatever
has been assembled to the area and pulled to the

568
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:27,440
center area. It would be considered a conversation
room or war room in some circumstances, but it's

569
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:35,158
very haphazardly thrown together. You also do
notice that there are a couple of rooms that have

570
00:35:35,158 --> 00:35:42,429
a foul stench, and as you glance off to the left
into the inside, you can see there are piles of

571
00:35:42,429 --> 00:35:44,442
folded dark material.

572
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:47,251
LAURA: Toilet paper.

573
00:35:47,251 --> 00:35:54,343
(laughter)

574
00:35:54,343 --> 00:36:00,006
MATT: It's your favored terrain. But you guys are
led into this main chamber.

575
00:36:00,006 --> 00:36:03,933
SAM: Do we just pass by those things?

576
00:36:03,933 --> 00:36:06,324
MATT: As you begin to walk by, you glance over and
see it as you go.

577
00:36:06,324 --> 00:36:08,012
LAURA: Can we see what it is? It looks like dark
folded material?

578
00:36:08,012 --> 00:36:16,077
MATT: If you want to stop and look behind, you can
have a closer look. It's a hide-type material. It

579
00:36:16,077 --> 00:36:21,739
looks folded, and then as you walk in, you can see
it's actually a series of piled corpses of some

580
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:26,800
sort of leathery creature or creatures that have
been pushed into an area there.

581
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:34,084
TALIESIN: I'm going to take this moment to change
out my attunement for my gloves from my sword. I'm

582
00:36:34,084 --> 00:36:39,338
going to put my gloves on and unattune to my
sword.

583
00:36:39,338 --> 00:36:40,977
MATT: Okay.

584
00:36:40,977 --> 00:36:45,138
LAURA: General, how many soldiers does this fort
support?

585
00:36:45,138 --> 00:36:50,372
MATT: As she enters the chamber ahead of you and
turns around and sits in her chair, her shield set

586
00:36:50,372 --> 00:37:00,144
to the side. "We currently now, as the Aegis
Regiment, have a grand total of 225 soldiers."

587
00:37:00,144 --> 00:37:01,385
SAM: Pretty good.

588
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,424
LAURA: And how many can be here?

589
00:37:03,424 --> 00:37:05,738
MATT: "As far as all the regiments?"

590
00:37:05,738 --> 00:37:06,981
LAURA: Yeah.

591
00:37:06,981 --> 00:37:14,500
MATT: "We're looking at, between how many survive
or return from Syngorn, close to 2,000."

592
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,342
LAURA: (quietly) All right.

593
00:37:16,342 --> 00:37:21,304
SAM: So you have 225 here currently?

594
00:37:21,304 --> 00:37:22,630
MATT: "We do."

595
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:29,055
SAM: And how is morale? Everyone have enough
supplies and ready to defend the fort if needed?

596
00:37:29,055 --> 00:37:33,922
MATT: "To be perfectly honest--" And the door
closes behind you as two of the guards step in

597
00:37:33,922 --> 00:37:39,665
front and watch it as you all find your seats or
at least stand in the space. General Elle goes,

598
00:37:39,665 --> 00:37:48,250
"To be perfectly honest, we are very low on
supplies. Any of the trade routes to and from

599
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:55,310
"Kraghammer have been constantly harried by wyvern
riders. We've had to defend our location a couple

600
00:37:55,310 --> 00:38:08,520
"times by some errant wandering sentinel wyvern
riders. It's been-- (sighs) We're on the edge of

601
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,334
"starvation."

602
00:38:10,334 --> 00:38:16,548
TRAVIS: Shit. Pardon my bluntness, but any flybys
by Thordak himself?

603
00:38:16,548 --> 00:38:23,185
MATT: "Thankfully, no. He would tear into this
place in but an instant. We only have bits of

604
00:38:23,185 --> 00:38:26,920
"information we've had from few scouts we've sent
southward. We've had some conversations to and

605
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:31,946
"from Emon, but only half of them have even
returned, and those that have say that it's a very

606
00:38:31,946 --> 00:38:38,737
"dire situation, so we've been awaiting any word we
can from Mikael-- sorry, from the Warmaster-- and

607
00:38:38,737 --> 00:38:47,670
"nothing. So as far as I know, and have known, we
are on our own and left possibly to die while the

608
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:54,389
"rest of this entire country burns to the ground.
So seeing some seemingly friendly faces--" And she

609
00:38:54,389 --> 00:38:58,791
nods towards Allura, "--is the best news I've had
in a very long time."

610
00:38:58,791 --> 00:39:04,677
LAURA: In your Warmaster's defense, it might be
beyond his control to get back here.

611
00:39:04,677 --> 00:39:07,238
TALIESIN: Things are dire.

612
00:39:07,238 --> 00:39:13,652
MARISHA: Thordak is changing the entire landscape
to be very similar to the Fire Plane.

613
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:15,465
LAURA: And he's stuck in the Feywild.

614
00:39:15,465 --> 00:39:18,598
MATT: "Who's stuck in the Feywild?"

615
00:39:18,598 --> 00:39:23,517
LAURA: The Warmaster, here.

616
00:39:23,517 --> 00:39:24,611
MATT: "Mikael?"

617
00:39:24,611 --> 00:39:25,676
LAURA: Yeah, Mikael.

618
00:39:25,676 --> 00:39:27,550
MARISHA: All of Syngorn, actually.

619
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,183
SAM: Are we telling them this?

620
00:39:29,183 --> 00:39:31,032
LAURA and TALIESIN: Why not?

621
00:39:31,032 --> 00:39:42,303
MATT: "Well, at least I know that they weren't
wiped out, and that's good news. But still, we're

622
00:39:42,303 --> 00:39:47,406
"not enough to even attempt an incursion on Emon by
our own."

623
00:39:47,406 --> 00:39:53,746
TALIESIN: Well, that is true, and that is the
purpose for our visit.

624
00:39:53,746 --> 00:40:01,101
TRAVIS: We may be able to help, though. At least
where resources are concerned.

625
00:40:01,101 --> 00:40:04,151
TALIESIN: Oh, I would say so. We have to. That
will be job one.

626
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:08,442
MARISHA: How is the land around the fort? Do you
have any farm land currently?

627
00:40:08,442 --> 00:40:16,141
MATT: "What little bit grows here is not of the
edible variety. We have to rely on the farmlands

628
00:40:16,141 --> 00:40:20,626
"of Emon for most of our produce, and those have
dried up, so we've been left to hunting and

629
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:27,200
"slaughtering what is available, which is not much
these days, as we're constantly in battle with the

630
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:34,660
"giants of the north to keep some semblance of food
intake to keep our soldiers fed and living."

631
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,605
SAM: (quietly) We can help a little with that,
right?

632
00:40:36,605 --> 00:40:38,813
TALIESIN: Oh, yes. And we'll have to.

633
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:45,321
LAURA: Maybe throw some food through a tree when
we open it up, just chuck some corn.

634
00:40:45,321 --> 00:40:46,538
TALIESIN: Sandwiches!

635
00:40:46,538 --> 00:40:48,768
LAURA: Take some spaghetti!

636
00:40:48,768 --> 00:40:51,437
TRAVIS: Could we load up a cart, though, and wheel
it through?

637
00:40:51,437 --> 00:40:57,007
SAM: Well, but can't Keyleth make some farmland,
right here in the fort? Little small garden sort

638
00:40:57,007 --> 00:40:58,389
of a thing?

639
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:04,895
MARISHA: It takes eight hours, but it seems like
we might have to do some field trips anyway.

640
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:09,174
TALIESIN: The airship will be heading here anyway.
We can load it with supplies as well.

641
00:41:09,174 --> 00:41:10,194
TRAVIS: To here?

642
00:41:10,194 --> 00:41:13,754
TALIESIN: To here. Everything will be coming here,
if things go the way that we hope they will.

643
00:41:13,754 --> 00:41:17,434
TRAVIS: General, can I ask, are you close with
Mikael?

644
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:20,829
MATT: "I've been under him for 15 years, yes."

645
00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:22,469
TRAVIS: Consider yourself friends?

646
00:41:22,469 --> 00:41:23,554
MATT: "Friends?"

647
00:41:23,554 --> 00:41:24,821
LIAM: You're the worst.

648
00:41:24,821 --> 00:41:30,556
TRAVIS: I mean, it didn't even take a second. Not
one second. Have you no decency?

649
00:41:30,556 --> 00:41:34,946
TALIESIN: I specifically looked left, hoping.

650
00:41:34,946 --> 00:41:38,158
MATT: (clears throat)

651
00:41:38,158 --> 00:41:41,241
LAURA: Sorry. You've been under him for how long?

652
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:44,316
MATT: "15 years."

653
00:41:44,316 --> 00:41:46,181
LAURA: 15 years. Long time.

654
00:41:46,181 --> 00:41:50,284
TRAVIS: Pick a fight. Pick a fight with the
general, then. Good. That's good.

655
00:41:50,284 --> 00:42:02,722
MATT: "Allura, are these trusted?" And Allura
nods. "Very. They have a thought. More of a plan.

656
00:42:02,722 --> 00:42:09,823
"A plan that if it works should put us in a much
more advantageous position in the conflict with

657
00:42:09,823 --> 00:42:15,515
"the Chroma Conclave. Please, give them your ear.
Give them your respect. They've proven time and

658
00:42:15,515 --> 00:42:17,257
"time again to be capable."

659
00:42:17,257 --> 00:42:22,195
MARISHA: Forgive us, we've just been through a lot,
Elle.

660
00:42:22,195 --> 00:42:25,923
TALIESIN: We've actually already killed three of
the five Chroma Conclave.

661
00:42:25,923 --> 00:42:30,591
MATT: She leans back in her chair. "Is this
true?"

662
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:34,937
MARISHA: I reach in and I pull out one of the
teeth and throw it on the table.

663
00:42:34,937 --> 00:42:36,717
TALIESIN: You can't just keep giving those away.

664
00:42:36,717 --> 00:42:46,771
MATT: She catches it in the middle. She gives you
a very stern look, and eyeing you over, trying to

665
00:42:46,771 --> 00:42:58,615
give you a read and then slowly it goes from group
to group. "Well, then perhaps this is our

666
00:42:58,615 --> 00:43:01,115
"salvation." Throws the tooth back to you.

667
00:43:01,115 --> 00:43:02,670
MARISHA: Did you see that?

668
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,003
LAURA: That was a good catch.

669
00:43:04,003 --> 00:43:05,429
MARISHA: Thanks, guys.

670
00:43:05,429 --> 00:43:10,064
TALIESIN: Before we get ahead of ourselves, our
hope is that we think we can lure Thordak out of

671
00:43:10,064 --> 00:43:17,624
the city, and we think we can get him into a piece
of terrain that gives us the advantage. We were

672
00:43:17,624 --> 00:43:21,900
hoping this would be where we consolidate our
forces and make a stand against him.

673
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,379
MATT: "You wish to bring the Cinder King here?"

674
00:43:25,379 --> 00:43:32,360
SAM: Not just the Cinder King. We would also bring
allies to support you and to buffer your forces

675
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:40,304
and hopefully with enough planning time to get you
and your men back on their feet, well fed and

676
00:43:40,304 --> 00:43:41,798
ready for a fight.

677
00:43:41,798 --> 00:43:45,971
LAURA: We're hoping we'll be able to bring Mikael
and Syngorn's army back as well.

678
00:43:45,971 --> 00:43:48,513
SAM: Mikael's navy.

679
00:43:48,513 --> 00:43:49,758
LIAM: Yes.

680
00:43:49,758 --> 00:43:57,463
TALIESIN: I hate you all. We either face him in
his home, in his terrain, with his guards

681
00:43:57,463 --> 00:44:04,223
everywhere, with people we cannot trust
everywhere, or we lure him out and we bring him

682
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:08,964
somewhere where we know the terrain, where we have
places to hide, where we are prepared for him.

683
00:44:08,964 --> 00:44:14,569
MATT: She nods and leans forward, putting one hand
over the other and her elbows on the edge of her

684
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:21,045
knees on her chair. "And what makes you think a
creature of such power and intelligence would ever

685
00:44:21,045 --> 00:44:24,084
"leave such an advantageous position to be
vulnerable?"

686
00:44:24,084 --> 00:44:37,262
SAM: To kill us. We are the bait, and we are also
the dragon killer. So he will come here to kill

687
00:44:37,262 --> 00:44:45,515
us, or to at least investigate our whereabouts, we
hope, and when he arrives, we'll wait in ambush.

688
00:44:45,515 --> 00:44:56,495
MATT: "Very well. If you're confident, you have
Fort Daxio and the Aegis Regiment behind you. I

689
00:44:56,495 --> 00:44:58,616
"just hope you know what you're doing."

690
00:44:58,616 --> 00:45:04,575
TRAVIS: Oh, we do. We've killed, like, a number of
them and none of us have died yet.

691
00:45:04,575 --> 00:45:06,439
LAURA: Not even a little bit.

692
00:45:06,439 --> 00:45:11,971
TRAVIS: We started with this many, and this many
is still here, is what I mean.

693
00:45:11,971 --> 00:45:15,250
SAM: I mean, technically, we started the day with
this many, that's for sure.

694
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,424
SEVERAL: Yeah.

695
00:45:16,424 --> 00:45:19,790
MARISHA: What's unconsciousness? (nervous
laughter)

696
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:23,595
MATT: You can see her expression drop a little bit
into a curled eyebrow of confusion.

697
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:24,861
LAURA: Three down.

698
00:45:24,861 --> 00:45:32,092
TALIESIN: There's no guarantees, but this is the
best bet. This is the best place for us at this

699
00:45:32,092 --> 00:45:35,561
point. I'm sure you understand. There are no
guarantees.

700
00:45:35,561 --> 00:45:38,078
LAURA: Do you have underground facilities?
Something that guards against dragon fire?

701
00:45:38,078 --> 00:45:42,123
MARISHA: We noticed a few of the trebuchets when
we walked in. How many of those do you have?

702
00:45:42,123 --> 00:45:43,510
MATT: "Functional? Three."

703
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:44,979
TALIESIN: We can work on that.

704
00:45:44,979 --> 00:45:46,197
MARISHA: Percy?

705
00:45:46,197 --> 00:45:47,522
LAURA: How many non-functional?

706
00:45:47,522 --> 00:45:49,043
MATT: "12."

707
00:45:49,043 --> 00:45:50,924
TALIESIN: We can work on that.

708
00:45:50,924 --> 00:45:59,666
MATT: "Very not functional. Look, siege warfare
hasn't been necessary for a very long time, let

709
00:45:59,666 --> 00:46:05,883
"alone counter-siege. Fort Daxio hasn't been under
attack in close to 200 years."

710
00:46:05,883 --> 00:46:10,806
LAURA: It could happen. When was the last time
ancient dragons took over the land?

711
00:46:10,806 --> 00:46:17,181
MATT: "Which is exactly why we don't have any
dragon fire-protected subterranean tunnels. My

712
00:46:17,181 --> 00:46:20,528
"apologies, but, you know, even our budgets are
limited."

713
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:26,138
TALIESIN: Well, we can get to work. We can get
people in. We can start making this place ready

714
00:46:26,138 --> 00:46:31,241
and we can start making a plan. We have a lot of
power and a lot of energy at our disposal.

715
00:46:31,241 --> 00:46:33,834
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's a montage waiting to happen.

716
00:46:33,834 --> 00:46:38,135
MATT: "How soon do you imagine this to
transpire?"

717
00:46:38,135 --> 00:46:39,716
LAURA: The montage?

718
00:46:39,716 --> 00:46:41,531
MARISHA: Oh, we can get started right now!

719
00:46:41,531 --> 00:46:49,104
MATT: "No, I mean, call-- wait, wait, wait!" She
waves her hand and interrupts the montage.

720
00:46:49,104 --> 00:46:51,877
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."

721
00:46:51,877 --> 00:46:57,988
TRAVIS: (singing) Going to build some tunnels,
make them look real cool!

722
00:46:57,988 --> 00:47:10,745
SAM: It will take us a few days, if not weeks, to
summon all of our allies here, and we'll need to

723
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:18,381
get your forces ready as well. Is this something
that you can fully support? Would you rather fight

724
00:47:18,381 --> 00:47:21,982
bravely against a dragon than die a slow
starvation death?

725
00:47:21,982 --> 00:47:30,508
MATT: "We exist here as protectors of Emon and the
Council of Tal'dorei. With the current state of

726
00:47:30,508 --> 00:47:37,063
"things, what's left of those things we choose and
have given ourselves to protect, if we can we

727
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:39,032
"will. So yes."

728
00:47:39,032 --> 00:47:41,076
SAM: Okay.

729
00:47:41,076 --> 00:47:43,086
TALIESIN: Well, step one is food, then.

730
00:47:43,086 --> 00:47:45,307
TRAVIS: Yeah, resources and food.

731
00:47:45,307 --> 00:47:50,626
MARISHA: What time is it here? Just creating
farmland all over the world.

732
00:47:50,626 --> 00:47:56,794
MATT: I'd say it's midday.

733
00:47:56,794 --> 00:47:59,510
LAURA: We need some source of water, too.

734
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:02,885
SAM: We have one pitcher of water whenever we need
it.

735
00:48:02,885 --> 00:48:04,203
TRAVIS: Yeah, baby!

736
00:48:04,203 --> 00:48:06,460
TALIESIN: Actually, they might already have a well
here.

737
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,639
MARISHA: Yeah, like a well?

738
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:18,043
MATT: Yeah, it still rains here, and it has
watershed elements that come through the Othendin

739
00:48:18,043 --> 00:48:23,640
Pass from the Cliffkeep Mountains. It's the ground
in this particular valley, like elements of the

740
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:28,435
Cliffkeep in the north, it isn't very fertile for
any sort of vegetation to take root.

741
00:48:28,435 --> 00:48:30,862
TALIESIN: There's no food you can grow
underground, is there?

742
00:48:30,862 --> 00:48:39,055
TRAVIS: I saw this movie called The Martian. If we
shit all over everything, it'll grow. Yeah, lots

743
00:48:39,055 --> 00:48:41,277
of potatoes grow from shit.

744
00:48:41,277 --> 00:48:44,542
ASHLEY: Maybe if we could make a composting system
for them.

745
00:48:44,542 --> 00:48:46,382
SAM: So you can't grow anything right now?

746
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:51,924
MARISHA: Can I get someone to take me to a
courtyard, or something like that?

747
00:48:51,924 --> 00:48:58,795
MATT: The courtyard is the area between the outer
wall and the fortress itself, which is all built

748
00:48:58,795 --> 00:49:00,461
into the side of the mountain.

749
00:49:00,461 --> 00:49:07,683
MARISHA: Can I do some sort of druidy soil test?
pH test, or something like that?

750
00:49:07,683 --> 00:49:09,609
MATT: Make a nature check.

751
00:49:09,609 --> 00:49:17,554
MARISHA: See if I can grow stuff here? With a
Plant Growth spell. Just a nature check? 15.

752
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:23,433
MATT: 15? I mean, it doesn't take too much for you
to find out that the dirt here, the land itself,

753
00:49:23,433 --> 00:49:33,254
is very nutrient-devoid. It is a near salt and
rock land, which is why a lot of it does not

754
00:49:33,254 --> 00:49:34,595
facilitate--

755
00:49:34,595 --> 00:49:37,675
MARISHA: Can I not fix that with a Plant Growth
spell?

756
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:39,346
MATT: Do you have a spell that could fix that?

757
00:49:39,346 --> 00:49:42,068
MARISHA: Does Plant Growth fix that?

758
00:49:42,068 --> 00:49:44,125
MATT: Let's read the spell.

759
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:46,734
TALIESIN: We have options.

760
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:58,166
SAM: For at least a day, I could create a soup
kitchen. People could come in and take a bowl and leave.

761
00:49:58,166 --> 00:50:00,508
LAURA: Could they have something with veggies,
too, though?

762
00:50:00,508 --> 00:50:05,063
MATT: Plant Growth affects plants that already
exist, as opposed to the actual land itself.

763
00:50:05,063 --> 00:50:07,608
MARISHA: All plants in a half-mile radius--

764
00:50:07,608 --> 00:50:11,410
LAURA: Isn't there something that turns the land
fertile?

765
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:13,254
ASHLEY: Poop.

766
00:50:13,254 --> 00:50:16,506
TALIESIN: That's like, 5th level.

767
00:50:16,506 --> 00:50:18,807
ASHLEY: Do you have horses? Lots of horses?

768
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,522
LIAM: But I mean, Scanlan, until we are ready to
pull the trigger--

769
00:50:21,522 --> 00:50:24,159
SAM: Yeah, I mean I could create a soup kitchen,
basically.

770
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:25,368
LIAM: Once a day, yeah?

771
00:50:25,368 --> 00:50:29,630
SAM: Sure. Yeah. We can have a bread line going in
and out.

772
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:34,999
TRAVIS: In the meantime, Percy could take a look
at some of the weaponry. Maybe look at building a

773
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:36,715
tunnel, or a bunker.

774
00:50:36,715 --> 00:50:43,981
SAM: General, when's the next feeding time for
your next shift of men?

775
00:50:43,981 --> 00:50:50,726
MATT: "We've had to relegate it to just morning
and afternoon meals to help ration our supplies.

776
00:50:50,726 --> 00:50:59,520
"So I would say four hours til dusk, that would be
the next allotted mess time."

777
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,352
TALIESIN: Can this actually work? Can we use the
spell this way?

778
00:51:02,352 --> 00:51:05,842
SAM: What, the mansion? Sure, I think so. Right?

779
00:51:05,842 --> 00:51:10,771
MATT: It's a unique way of utilizing it, but I
don't see why not.

780
00:51:10,771 --> 00:51:13,618
LAURA: It's a Sizzler. I like it.

781
00:51:13,618 --> 00:51:15,506
(phone ringing)

782
00:51:15,506 --> 00:51:17,725
SAM: Oh, shit! Shit balls! I can't--

783
00:51:17,725 --> 00:51:21,135
MATT: We talked about this.

784
00:51:21,135 --> 00:51:27,996
SAM: Sorry. I had an alarm to take off my shirt.

785
00:51:27,996 --> 00:51:29,826
LAURA: Oh, you did?

786
00:51:29,826 --> 00:51:32,204
SAM: I have to wear four shirts tonight because of
reasons.

787
00:51:32,204 --> 00:51:35,106
(laughter)

788
00:51:35,106 --> 00:51:36,570
TRAVIS: Really?

789
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:45,359
SAM: Yeah, it's an anal thing. I've worn 70
different shirts on 73 episodes of the show, so if

790
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:47,721
I wear four tonight, that's one for every
episode.

791
00:51:47,721 --> 00:51:49,475
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

792
00:51:49,475 --> 00:51:51,832
LIAM: That makes sense. That's time well spent.

793
00:51:51,832 --> 00:51:54,186
(laughter)

794
00:51:54,186 --> 00:52:04,146
TRAVIS: Liam and I will give you a dunking in the
bathroom after the break.

795
00:52:04,146 --> 00:52:06,591
LIAM: You'll get a swirly forthwith.

796
00:52:06,591 --> 00:52:12,868
LIAM: Are we going to double back to Dad?

797
00:52:12,868 --> 00:52:13,973
LAURA: We have to, right?

798
00:52:13,973 --> 00:52:15,146
LIAM: Yeah, soon.

799
00:52:15,146 --> 00:52:17,848
TALIESIN: We have to at least send word. That's
the first thing we have to--

800
00:52:17,848 --> 00:52:20,304
LAURA: I don't know how we send word to the
Feywild without going to the Feywild.

801
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:26,388
MARISHA: I can Plane Shift us there after we sleep
and I learn it the next morning.

802
00:52:26,388 --> 00:52:31,120
LIAM: Now that you've brought us there, do you
think you could get us closer?

803
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,825
MARISHA: I could take us straight there, yeah.

804
00:52:33,825 --> 00:52:38,231
TRAVIS: Percy, what do you think of looking at all
this weaponry?

805
00:52:38,231 --> 00:52:42,151
TALIESIN: I'm going to look at the battalions. See
if I can drudge up some people who actually know

806
00:52:42,151 --> 00:52:47,022
how these things function and start seeing how
difficult it would be to get the ones that are broken

807
00:52:47,022 --> 00:52:48,518
working.

808
00:52:48,518 --> 00:52:49,737
MATT: Okay.

809
00:52:49,737 --> 00:52:55,293
MARISHA: Can I figure out if the ground is sturdy
enough if I start digging little bunkers, that

810
00:52:55,293 --> 00:52:56,675
would be okay?

811
00:52:56,675 --> 00:52:58,608
MATT: Bunkers for?

812
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:03,762
MARISHA: Underground bunkers for hiding from a
flaming dragon breath.

813
00:53:03,762 --> 00:53:12,655
MATT: I mean, you could, probably. It's hard
packed, very solid ground. Westruun, is where you

814
00:53:12,655 --> 00:53:13,858
did it.

815
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:16,084
MARISHA: Westruun. We did the bunkers.

816
00:53:16,084 --> 00:53:19,877
LAURA: Didn't we do underground stuff in
Whitestone, too, though?

817
00:53:19,877 --> 00:53:24,093
MARISHA: I did a bunker under the Sun Tree, kind
of.

818
00:53:24,093 --> 00:53:26,164
TALIESIN: We do a lot of bunkers.

819
00:53:26,164 --> 00:53:28,466
MATT: At this point, Keyleth almost has a
burrowing speed.

820
00:53:28,466 --> 00:53:34,072
MARISHA: It's like that Fallout minigame that
they came out with, the app. Basically that.

821
00:53:34,072 --> 00:53:36,536
TRAVIS: Do we want to crack out the mansion?

822
00:53:36,536 --> 00:53:40,808
SAM: Yeah, sure. I'll crack out the mansion. Where
should I put it, General Elle?

823
00:53:40,808 --> 00:53:44,248
MATT: "I'm not entirely certain as to what you're
attempting to do here."

824
00:53:44,248 --> 00:53:51,001
SAM: Oh, I'm sorry. Through magical means. We are
all, not to brag, we are all super powerful. We're

825
00:53:51,001 --> 00:54:00,585
like a band of traveling superheroes. One of the
things that I can do is make a room or a home, a

826
00:54:00,585 --> 00:54:06,455
magical home, where everyone can go in and get a
quick meal and then go back out to work again. So

827
00:54:06,455 --> 00:54:11,203
with your permission and a location, I can create
this magical dwelling.

828
00:54:11,203 --> 00:54:17,421
MATT: Keeping her eyes trained on you, she leans
over towards Allura. "I can't tell, is the little

829
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:18,983
"man fucking with me?"

830
00:54:18,983 --> 00:54:21,461
TALIESIN: He gets that a lot.

831
00:54:21,461 --> 00:54:26,459
MATT: Allura goes, "Usually, yes, but no, he's
being completely honest right now."

832
00:54:26,459 --> 00:54:30,381
"Then, by all means, yes."

833
00:54:30,381 --> 00:54:33,735
SAM: Is there a spot where you would like your men
to--

834
00:54:33,735 --> 00:54:39,709
MATT: "Follow me to the mess hall." She seems
legitimately spooked and unsure what to make of

835
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:42,362
you, but leads you on anyway.

836
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,313
SAM: Most women are.

837
00:54:44,313 --> 00:54:51,056
MATT: But yeah, you can set up in the mess hall
entranceway. There is a large hall with long

838
00:54:51,056 --> 00:54:56,781
tables and she says that would be probably the
most optimal place to go ahead and set up shop there.

839
00:54:56,781 --> 00:54:58,210
MARISHA: Question.

840
00:54:58,210 --> 00:54:59,045
MATT: Yes?

841
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:04,791
MARISHA: Legi-- logi-- (fumbling words) Logistical
question. That's the word I was looking for.

842
00:55:04,791 --> 00:55:05,917
MATT: There you go.

843
00:55:05,917 --> 00:55:06,999
LIAM: Stuff and things.

844
00:55:06,999 --> 00:55:12,599
MARISHA: Stuff and things. Things and stuff. They
are low on meat because they're low on animals?

845
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:22,209
MATT: Most of their food was being brought by the
trade routes. Since then, they've had to hunt for

846
00:55:22,209 --> 00:55:27,611
food and go off of whatever stock and store they
had, and even that's running really low. They're

847
00:55:27,611 --> 00:55:31,122
hard-pressed to maintain.

848
00:55:31,122 --> 00:55:36,578
MARISHA: Could I do a Conjure Woodland Beings and
conjure a bunch of deer?

849
00:55:36,578 --> 00:55:38,229
TRAVIS: Fuck yes.

850
00:55:38,229 --> 00:55:41,989
MARISHA: And then we could play shooting range?

851
00:55:41,989 --> 00:55:44,018
LAURA: Do they disappear when they're dead?

852
00:55:44,018 --> 00:55:45,729
MARISHA: Oh, right. They disappear.

853
00:55:45,729 --> 00:55:52,387
MATT: Yep. They would watch that meat go (poof).
Sorry.

854
00:55:52,387 --> 00:55:58,302
MARISHA: Oh, that's mean. No, I don't do that, by
the way. I was asking ahead of time, because that

855
00:55:58,302 --> 00:56:00,928
would be mean. Never mind.

856
00:56:00,928 --> 00:56:02,396
TRAVIS: Also awesome.

857
00:56:02,396 --> 00:56:06,997
MATT: This one druid got to level three and then
opened its own hunting emporium and never became

858
00:56:06,997 --> 00:56:08,685
an adventurer again.

859
00:56:08,685 --> 00:56:11,096
TRAVIS: Supply for days.

860
00:56:11,096 --> 00:56:18,110
MATT: Yeah! So you're setting up the mess hall.
You're checking in to see-- go ahead and make an

861
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:21,436
investigation check, Taliesin, if you don't mind.

862
00:56:21,436 --> 00:56:26,722
TALIESIN: Ew. Seven.

863
00:56:26,722 --> 00:56:35,314
MATT: Seven? Asking around over the next couple
hours or so, it appears that most anyone who would

864
00:56:35,314 --> 00:56:40,830
be a specialist in any sort of siege weaponry was
part of the other regiments that are no longer

865
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:47,004
part of Daxio. Even so, some of the weaponry that
was here looks like it was ordered partially just

866
00:56:47,004 --> 00:56:54,427
to get the money in. A lot of the trebuchets that
are functional are very dry-rotted and have seen

867
00:56:54,427 --> 00:56:59,651
many rainy winters and haven't really been kept
up, and you're not even sure if they'd fire. The

868
00:56:59,651 --> 00:57:05,601
ones that have broken down, a lot of the wood
rotted. There isn't a lot of weaponry. It looks

869
00:57:05,601 --> 00:57:09,780
like the three could be fixed up and be
functional, but the ones that aren't, it would

870
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:14,785
take you weeks with new lumber and new materials
to even get them remotely functional.

871
00:57:14,785 --> 00:57:28,740
TALIESIN: All right, we can make do. We can make
do. I will definitely start making plans for the

872
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:33,795
three that are functional to get them in tip-top
working condition.

873
00:57:33,795 --> 00:57:39,911
MATT: With successful tinkering checks on this,
with a few borrowed hands for manpower, you could

874
00:57:39,911 --> 00:57:45,122
probably repair one per day of work. That's a full
eight-hour day of work. So be aware of that.

875
00:57:45,122 --> 00:57:51,740
TALIESIN: All right. How many more of them were
disheveled and broken?

876
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:53,247
MATT: About 12 of them.

877
00:57:53,247 --> 00:57:55,109
TALIESIN: And they each had their own spot?

878
00:57:55,109 --> 00:58:02,890
MATT: The three that are still semi-functional are
pulled back about 60 or so feet from the edge of

879
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:07,456
the walls, and then the rest of them have actually
been wheeled over into the corner and have all

880
00:58:07,456 --> 00:58:10,362
been jammed up on the edge, unused and not to take
up space.

881
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:19,117
TALIESIN: Okay. That'll start, at least. I'm going
to look for any improvements that can be made in

882
00:58:19,117 --> 00:58:25,730
defensive measures against flying creatures in any
way. If we use some Stone Shape, we can make this

883
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:29,964
even more defendable against flying creatures, et
cetera.

884
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:38,172
TRAVIS: General? Just because, like, I'm an
inquisitive mind, what is the travel time from

885
00:58:38,172 --> 00:58:44,231
here to Emon on foot, on a beast? Those two.

886
00:58:44,231 --> 00:58:56,520
MATT: "On foot, I'd say it would put you at about
five to six days. Horseback, straight through

887
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:00,726
"without sleep and running the beast into the
ground, you could do it in a day."

888
00:59:00,726 --> 00:59:05,758
TRAVIS: Wow. Cool. Good deal.

889
00:59:05,758 --> 00:59:09,924
MARISHA: Are you trying to think of bringing back
supplies?

890
00:59:09,924 --> 00:59:14,989
TRAVIS: No, I was seeing if I could run there in a
night and back.

891
00:59:14,989 --> 00:59:16,686
MARISHA: Just to scout it out?

892
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:27,348
TRAVIS: No, I'm not fucking running over there.
Are you crazy? I was just curious.

893
00:59:27,348 --> 00:59:31,177
MATT: Anything else anyone else is looking to do?

894
00:59:31,177 --> 00:59:38,904
MARISHA: I guess I can start on the underground
bunker. For tonight, I guess.

895
00:59:38,904 --> 00:59:48,260
TALIESIN: I'll start on one of the-- oh god, my
brain has completely turned to mush.

896
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,301
MATT: Trebuchet?

897
00:59:49,301 --> 00:59:50,906
TALIESIN: Trebuchet, thank you. I love the word.

898
00:59:50,906 --> 00:59:52,615
MATT: Go ahead and make a tinkering check.

899
00:59:52,615 --> 00:59:54,863
SAM: What are you guys going to do?

900
00:59:54,863 --> 00:59:59,099
TRAVIS: That mess hall-- is there a gathering
quarters for the soldiers?

901
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:06,257
MATT: There is a barracks built into the
stronghold where many of the soldiers sleep. Where

902
01:00:06,257 --> 01:00:12,845
there is a common area, with general tables, card
games, and things to pass the time. There is a

903
01:00:12,845 --> 01:00:16,934
small library, with various books. You get the
sense here as you begin to walk around and see the

904
01:00:16,934 --> 01:00:20,779
soldiers, since these guys are essentially the
defensive reserve for Fort Daxio, and Daxio

905
01:00:20,779 --> 01:00:25,883
doesn't see a lot of military action, it's very
much a train-and-wait type circumstance. And many

906
01:00:25,883 --> 01:00:31,548
of the soldiers, though they have grown a little
gaunt in the face from lack of resources, also

907
01:00:31,548 --> 01:00:36,711
appear to be emotionally drained from having
nothing to do. And this constant stressful

908
01:00:36,711 --> 01:00:43,662
uncertainty about their future fate has this air
of very low morale within the fort.

909
01:00:43,662 --> 01:00:49,748
TRAVIS: General, please don't take this the wrong
way. Do you trust your men?

910
01:00:49,748 --> 01:00:59,717
MATT: "I do. I trust their ability. I trust that
they've stayed with me in the face of all this

911
01:00:59,717 --> 01:01:07,827
"opposition and believe that my orders and
requests to stay vigilant in the face of such

912
01:01:07,827 --> 01:01:17,295
"possible destruction, having been met with
continued agreeance that they will follow me as

913
01:01:17,295 --> 01:01:19,223
"needed to our end."

914
01:01:19,223 --> 01:01:22,755
TRAVIS: And there are none that you worry about,
none that have expressed a lack of confidence,

915
01:01:22,755 --> 01:01:26,707
none that you're keeping your eye on? Giving you a
weird feeling?

916
01:01:26,707 --> 01:01:28,082
MATT: "None that live."

917
01:01:28,082 --> 01:01:31,167
TRAVIS: I like that answer. Shit.

918
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:37,126
SAM: Oi, twinsies.

919
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:38,117
LAURA: Oi.

920
01:01:38,117 --> 01:01:46,413
SAM: Maybe you should fly up, and if Thordak's
going to attack from the air, see where the spot

921
01:01:46,413 --> 01:01:50,298
is that he would attack, like a spot of weakness
from above?

922
01:01:50,298 --> 01:01:56,187
LIAM: Well, that's not a bad idea. We're thinking
about tomorrow, though, as well. In the morning, yeah.

923
01:01:56,187 --> 01:01:58,939
LAURA: Maybe we should pop into Syngorn.

924
01:01:58,939 --> 01:02:00,488
LIAM: Could you take the two of us, Keyleth?

925
01:02:00,488 --> 01:02:03,960
LAURA: But yeah, we'll fly up. Let's do that.

926
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:08,909
MATT: All right, so you guys go ahead and coast
up, to do what?

927
01:02:08,909 --> 01:02:14,084
LIAM: To see if there's anything of use, see if
there's anything to be gleaned from a bird's-eye view.

928
01:02:14,084 --> 01:02:15,926
LAURA: Because it's on the cliffside, right?

929
01:02:15,926 --> 01:02:20,827
MATT: Yeah, if you look at the large ravine that
is carved through this portion of the mountain

930
01:02:20,827 --> 01:02:28,821
there. From your perspective, looking at the map
down this way. It is on the western side of the

931
01:02:28,821 --> 01:02:38,749
ravine, against the mountain. You guys coast up,
looking up. Matching the very height of the

932
01:02:38,749 --> 01:02:43,251
mountain, the bluff that leads down into the ravine
itself, and you can see over the edge the ocean of

933
01:02:43,251 --> 01:02:49,675
the Ozmit Sea that heads off westward. You can see
a little bit of the light as the sun comes down to

934
01:02:49,675 --> 01:02:56,891
a sunset. You can see it glittering across the
waves in the distance. You can see the little

935
01:02:56,891 --> 01:03:01,899
mountain range to the north of Emon, peering over
the edge. And you can see a little bit of a dark

936
01:03:01,899 --> 01:03:07,605
spot in the very distance, over the horizon that
you can gather where Emon is. You can see it from

937
01:03:07,605 --> 01:03:10,480
this high up. Even though it is but a small spot.

938
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,568
LAURA: (sings) From a distance...

939
01:03:12,568 --> 01:03:14,453
LIAM: (shouts) What?

940
01:03:14,453 --> 01:03:17,449
LAURA: (shouts) It looks peaceful up here.

941
01:03:17,449 --> 01:03:19,931
LIAM: (shouts) Sure.

942
01:03:19,931 --> 01:03:25,243
LAURA: What are we doing? Do we see anything
interesting?

943
01:03:25,243 --> 01:03:28,198
LIAM: Not enjoying the view, I start to look down
around, is there anything?

944
01:03:28,198 --> 01:03:34,977
LAURA: That seems useful, for, like, if we put
something on the cliffside or something? Maybe a

945
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:38,784
hideout, somewhere to hide from view, something
like that?

946
01:03:38,784 --> 01:03:41,724
LIAM: Is there anything we didn't see coming up?
Or is it all plain to view?

947
01:03:41,724 --> 01:03:44,088
MATT: Both of you guys make an investigation.

948
01:03:44,088 --> 01:03:51,055
LAURA: Almost awesome. 19.

949
01:03:51,055 --> 01:03:52,385
LIAM: 23.

950
01:03:52,385 --> 01:04:01,172
MATT: You guys take the next hour or so coasting
along the edge of the mountain range, the top of

951
01:04:01,172 --> 01:04:02,617
the ravine itself.

952
01:04:02,617 --> 01:04:04,127
LAURA: Is it a mountain?

953
01:04:04,127 --> 01:04:09,413
MATT: There are, it is a mountain range and the
ravine itself carves through a portion of it, so

954
01:04:09,413 --> 01:04:10,967
the right and left side, yes.

955
01:04:10,967 --> 01:04:14,712
LIAM: At the 59 minute mark I fly over and sit on
the back of my sister's broom

956
01:04:14,712 --> 01:04:15,954
LAURA: Is it favored terrain?

957
01:04:15,954 --> 01:04:17,052
MATT: Is your favored terrain mountains?

958
01:04:17,052 --> 01:04:18,712
LAURA: Yeah.

959
01:04:18,805 --> 01:04:20,467
MATT: Then yeah, you get advantage on that.

960
01:04:20,467 --> 01:04:21,661
LAURA: 20.

961
01:04:21,661 --> 01:04:28,444
MATT: But still. You do have the advantage at the
top of these mountains of a wider range of view.

962
01:04:28,444 --> 01:04:33,577
It's good for somebody who's expecting an
incursion from flying creatures. It'd be a great

963
01:04:33,577 --> 01:04:40,358
place to put a scout, as a warning system, should
anything begin to make its way towards the fort

964
01:04:40,358 --> 01:04:48,673
from Emon or beyond. There are places where you
could in theory drop things down the edges of the

965
01:04:48,673 --> 01:04:53,711
mountain that would use the ravine almost like a
bowling alley, essentially, large boulders and

966
01:04:53,711 --> 01:04:59,393
rocks. Which is a favored tactic of many stone
giants and other giants who use mountain terrain

967
01:04:59,393 --> 01:05:07,171
to their advantage. But beyond that, there's no
other terrain that you think would, outside of you

968
01:05:07,171 --> 01:05:11,524
coming up with a creative use of it, there's
nothing that is glaring to you as an advantage in

969
01:05:11,524 --> 01:05:12,962
the coming fray.

970
01:05:12,962 --> 01:05:20,187
LAURA: We could put somebody in a hidey-hole up
here. And if they see anything, they drop a stone

971
01:05:20,187 --> 01:05:22,417
down to a designated area and let people know.

972
01:05:22,417 --> 01:05:28,174
LIAM: Yeah. They could throw out one of those
flare-like gem-y thingies. Ring a bell.

973
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:31,363
LAURA: Oh yeah! We have those. A bell is probably
the best idea.

974
01:05:31,363 --> 01:05:38,334
LIAM: Any of those. You want to take us down? This
broom always rides up my ass when I ride on it.

975
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:40,781
LAURA: Oh, because your little wings are dead?

976
01:05:40,781 --> 01:05:42,834
LIAM: Yes, they are.

977
01:05:42,834 --> 01:05:45,767
LAURA: All right. I'll float us down on my
ever-flying broom.

978
01:05:45,767 --> 01:05:47,116
LIAM: Ow!

979
01:05:47,116 --> 01:05:49,893
MATT: Okay, so you guys descend.

980
01:05:49,893 --> 01:05:54,095
LAURA: I go down pretty slow to make this last a
little bit longer.

981
01:05:54,095 --> 01:05:55,732
LIAM: Getting close though, yeah?

982
01:05:55,732 --> 01:05:58,003
LAURA: What?

983
01:05:58,003 --> 01:05:59,126
LIAM: What?

984
01:05:59,126 --> 01:06:01,326
LAURA: To take out all of this?

985
01:06:01,326 --> 01:06:02,780
LIAM: Yeah.

986
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:05,275
LAURA: Yeah.

987
01:06:05,275 --> 01:06:07,036
LIAM: Kill 'em, or die trying.

988
01:06:07,036 --> 01:06:08,275
LAURA: That's right.

989
01:06:08,275 --> 01:06:10,138
MATT: Both of you guys, make a perception check.

990
01:06:10,138 --> 01:06:16,829
LAURA: Oh, that was so close to a one, but it
wasn't! 20.

991
01:06:16,829 --> 01:06:17,999
LIAM: 22.

992
01:06:17,999 --> 01:06:21,225
MATT: 22, okay. As you guys come down--

993
01:06:21,225 --> 01:06:25,165
LAURA: Oh, wait, no! 26! My math was wrong.

994
01:06:25,165 --> 01:06:32,244
MATT: That's okay. As you guys come down into the
bottom of the ravine you make it down safely into

995
01:06:32,244 --> 01:06:40,600
Fort Daxio to gather with the rest of your
compadres for the evening. You at this point, by

996
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:45,524
the way, Scanlan. You are currently, because you
have to be present to designate anybody who can

997
01:06:45,524 --> 01:06:51,634
enter your mansion. You are like the one-person
homeless shelter. You are bringing through soldier

998
01:06:51,634 --> 01:06:56,214
after soldier into there. And they all look
confused, bewildered. And many of them stop and be

999
01:06:56,214 --> 01:06:58,000
like, "What's going on?"

1000
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,341
SAM: Name on the list? What's your name?

1001
01:06:59,341 --> 01:07:00,864
MATT: (stuttering) "I am--"

1002
01:07:00,864 --> 01:07:02,122
SAM: Name?

1003
01:07:02,122 --> 01:07:08,582
MATT: (stuttering) "Are you--? What is--?"

1004
01:07:08,582 --> 01:07:11,647
SAM: Listen, man. Do you want some food or not?
What's your name? I've got a big list here,

1005
01:07:11,647 --> 01:07:13,775
there's no girl with you.

1006
01:07:13,775 --> 01:07:15,487
MATT: "Trevian Simtin. Please, I'm hungry."

1007
01:07:15,487 --> 01:07:16,650
SAM: Do you have a plus one?

1008
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:18,832
MATT: "I have a plus?"

1009
01:07:18,832 --> 01:07:19,885
SAM: You're in."

1010
01:07:19,885 --> 01:07:30,526
MATT: "All right!" One after another, after
another. Some of them seem genuinely spooked and

1011
01:07:30,526 --> 01:07:35,236
freaked out by the spiritual servants, and
avoiding them as they go on. The smell of food

1012
01:07:35,236 --> 01:07:40,431
hits them, though. The ever-smell of chicken
cooking through does catch them. And they all seem

1013
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:46,795
to eventually get past their fear of the servants
as the fantastic meal of relatively neutral flesh

1014
01:07:46,795 --> 01:07:49,395
is served to them in your dining hall.

1015
01:07:49,395 --> 01:07:53,567
LAURA: There's still no veggies, huh? They
could probably use some vegetable nutrition.

1016
01:07:53,567 --> 01:07:58,180
SAM: I'm sure they boil the chicken in like an
onion sort of water.

1017
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:00,466
LAURA: Do they? Or is it like a chicken broth that
they boil them in?

1018
01:08:00,466 --> 01:08:03,316
SAM: They have the fusaka now. They put a little
bit of that in. Spices it up a bit.

1019
01:08:03,316 --> 01:08:05,327
TRAVIS: They've got a 300-year supply.

1020
01:08:05,327 --> 01:08:08,954
(laughter)

1021
01:08:08,954 --> 01:08:14,811
MATT: All right, Keyleth. Explain the bunker
you're building for me, if you could.

1022
01:08:14,811 --> 01:08:28,450
MARISHA: Should I do it on the inside? In the
courtyard, make an underground pod. Think

1023
01:08:28,450 --> 01:08:29,391
Fallout.

1024
01:08:29,391 --> 01:08:34,888
MATT: Right. Is it closer to the wall, or closer
to the actual fortress itself, the entrance that

1025
01:08:34,888 --> 01:08:38,005
leads to the underground pathway?

1026
01:08:38,005 --> 01:08:44,113
MARISHA: I imagine closer to the fortress, right?
On the inside.

1027
01:08:44,113 --> 01:08:45,960
LAURA: Deep in there.

1028
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:52,417
MATT: So you have a gradual decline near the
fortress, in the courtyard, that goes underneath.

1029
01:08:52,417 --> 01:08:58,594
And then mirrors the curvature of the wall? Or
does it travel perpendicular to it and go

1030
01:08:58,594 --> 01:09:00,061
underneath the wall?

1031
01:09:00,061 --> 01:09:02,560
MARISHA: I imagine we wouldn't want to go
underneath the wall.

1032
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:08,160
MATT: Right, so here's the fortress. With the
mountain. Fortress, and here's the wall around it.

1033
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:13,675
You're essentially building it in the same
curvature parallel to the outer wall.

1034
01:09:13,675 --> 01:09:14,808
MARISHA: Yes.

1035
01:09:14,808 --> 01:09:18,295
MATT: Okay. So you build this bunker, you take the
better part of the evening, and probably the next

1036
01:09:18,295 --> 01:09:23,183
morning or so to complete whatever the spell's
maximum effort is.

1037
01:09:23,183 --> 01:09:24,539
MARISHA: Yeah.

1038
01:09:24,539 --> 01:09:29,260
MATT: Okay, cool. I need you, with the manpower
you have, possible with you, Taliesin. Go ahead

1039
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:37,125
and make a tinkering check. This is going to be
with strength. It's very large physical activity.

1040
01:09:37,125 --> 01:09:44,254
This is less about your intellect or your manual
dexterity, this is about tools and having to apply

1041
01:09:44,254 --> 01:09:51,508
it. You do have advantage because you have other
men helping you with this. But the DC is

1042
01:09:51,508 --> 01:09:52,990
relatively high.

1043
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:59,785
TALIESIN: That'll do. 25.

1044
01:09:59,785 --> 01:10:04,858
MATT: 25, okay. While the rest of you are
finishing up your events of the evening and

1045
01:10:04,858 --> 01:10:10,316
preparing to go to sleep, Percy is working
tirelessly into the wee hours of the morning. You

1046
01:10:10,374 --> 01:10:14,412
finish, probably like two hours after midnight,
with the rest of your crew sore, sweaty. But you

1047
01:10:14,412 --> 01:10:21,727
have one functional trebuchet that looks like it
could handle many, many shots within one battle

1048
01:10:21,727 --> 01:10:23,299
and still be serviceable.

1049
01:10:23,299 --> 01:10:24,866
LIAM: Shirtless, covered in soot.

1050
01:10:24,866 --> 01:10:26,311
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

1051
01:10:26,311 --> 01:10:28,505
SAM: He wipes his brow.

1052
01:10:28,505 --> 01:10:30,154
MATT: As he slowly takes his glasses off--

1053
01:10:30,154 --> 01:10:34,433
TRAVIS: Yeah! Takes the water skin and just--

1054
01:10:34,433 --> 01:10:38,438
MATT: All the soldiers are like--

1055
01:10:38,438 --> 01:10:43,976
LAURA: Oh, Percy!

1056
01:10:43,976 --> 01:10:55,420
MATT: There you go. You guys take your evening to
rest. The next morning, you find yourselves awake.

1057
01:10:55,517 --> 01:11:05,179
Spells restored. Hit points restored. Allura comes
in and greets all of you. "All right, so! I can

1058
01:11:05,234 --> 01:11:13,984
"also bring us back to Whitestone. I've restored
the teleportation spell that I had. Thus, what do

1059
01:11:13,984 --> 01:11:15,565
"you wish to do now?"

1060
01:11:15,565 --> 01:11:18,599
LAURA: Number one. (whispers) Never say
"Whitestone" in public, ever.

1061
01:11:18,599 --> 01:11:30,773
TALIESIN: Around us, especially. We could still
do work here. Here's what has to happen now. We

1062
01:11:30,773 --> 01:11:34,671
need to send word to as many people as possible
that we are meeting here for the final

1063
01:11:34,671 --> 01:11:40,845
confrontation. We have to make sure that work
continues here. And then, if there's time, while

1064
01:11:40,845 --> 01:11:45,779
our forces assemble and things prepare, we have
several things we can do in the meantime.

1065
01:11:45,779 --> 01:11:49,227
TRAVIS: Right. Keyleth is necessary to get to the
Feywild.

1066
01:11:49,227 --> 01:11:51,688
LAURA: Or Allura.

1067
01:11:51,688 --> 01:11:55,537
MARISHA: Could I theoretically open a tree and
send people in?

1068
01:11:55,537 --> 01:11:57,726
LAURA: To the Feywild? But how would we get back?

1069
01:11:57,726 --> 01:12:00,692
MARISHA: No, not to the Feywild. If we need to see
someone to--

1070
01:12:00,692 --> 01:12:02,250
SAM: Whitestone?

1071
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:05,817
MARISHA: Yeah, or Marquet. Or wherever.

1072
01:12:05,817 --> 01:12:07,235
TALIESIN: We have the stone, as well.

1073
01:12:07,235 --> 01:12:10,075
TRAVIS: So it's going to be Keyleth and one of the
twinsies go to the Feywild, right?

1074
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:13,900
SAM: Can you do any plane shifting things, Pikey
Pike?

1075
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:19,526
ASHLEY: I don't have it prepared.

1076
01:12:19,526 --> 01:12:24,079
TRAVIS: I don't have it?

1077
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:26,105
ASHLEY: I don't have it prepared.

1078
01:12:26,105 --> 01:12:30,653
TRAVIS: You know, there is that fire elemental
plane with the last Vestige, eh?

1079
01:12:30,653 --> 01:12:36,607
TALIESIN: We could. That is absolutely on the
table.

1080
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:38,772
MARISH: Could we? Do we have time for that?

1081
01:12:38,772 --> 01:12:39,807
SAM: Sure!

1082
01:12:39,807 --> 01:12:45,102
TALIESIN: It's going to take us a week to get this
place even remotely ready for this confrontation.

1083
01:12:45,102 --> 01:12:50,453
MATT: Allura at this point, by the way, says, "A
week? I don't know if we have a week."

1084
01:12:50,453 --> 01:12:51,856
TRAVIS: Why?

1085
01:12:51,856 --> 01:12:53,474
TALIESIN: What happens in less than a week?

1086
01:12:53,474 --> 01:12:58,088
MATT: "The minute that the information of
Vorugal's death finds its way to Thordak, what do

1087
01:12:58,088 --> 01:13:01,325
"you think is going to happen? Their vengeance is
going to fall."

1088
01:13:01,325 --> 01:13:05,272
TALIESIN: It's going to take a few days for that
to happen, to be set in motion.

1089
01:13:05,272 --> 01:13:11,420
MARISHA: Are you kidding? I don't know. It could
be any minute now. They've been spying on us this

1090
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:13,674
whole time. What makes you think it will take a
few days?

1091
01:13:13,674 --> 01:13:20,161
SAM: Also, throwing it out there. If you guys go
to the Feywild, isn't there a chance that you

1092
01:13:20,161 --> 01:13:26,695
don't come back until a month later or something
crazy like that? Doesn't time shift weirdly?

1093
01:13:26,695 --> 01:13:41,964
MATT: Make an intelligence check. Add your
intelligence modifier.

1094
01:13:41,964 --> 01:13:44,771
SAM: Oh! 18.

1095
01:13:44,771 --> 01:13:48,049
MATT: 18. And you could technically add--

1096
01:13:48,049 --> 01:13:49,205
SAM: I did.

1097
01:13:49,205 --> 01:13:50,168
MATT: You added your d12 to it?

1098
01:13:50,168 --> 01:13:51,123
SAM: Oh, no, not my d12.

1099
01:13:51,123 --> 01:13:54,039
MATT: You could use one of your bardic
inspirations to inspire yourself, if you wanted to.

1100
01:13:54,039 --> 01:13:59,887
SAM: Sure, why not? I'll do that. All right, 22
then.

1101
01:13:59,887 --> 01:14:05,451
MATT: Having journeyed once to the Feywild, and
with the little bit of research you've done since

1102
01:14:05,451 --> 01:14:14,061
then. There have been people who have been to the
Feywild who do speak of some sort of temporal

1103
01:14:14,061 --> 01:14:18,657
anomaly when traveling to and from. So yes, you
are certain that there can be some sort of

1104
01:14:18,657 --> 01:14:23,939
flexibility as to the time spent there versus the
time that has transpired in the Prime Material

1105
01:14:23,939 --> 01:14:30,076
plane. Not a sure thing, but there is some
variation to that.

1106
01:14:30,076 --> 01:14:34,896
TRAVIS: What's life without a little risk?

1107
01:14:34,896 --> 01:14:40,070
LAURA: Maybe Syngorn will have control over that.
They can transfer back when they want to.

1108
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:42,717
TALIESIN: Let's see what we can do.

1109
01:14:42,717 --> 01:14:46,013
LAURA: They have a huge army.

1110
01:14:46,013 --> 01:14:48,548
TRAVIS: And they've got werewolves in their
woods.

1111
01:14:48,548 --> 01:14:51,760
LAURA: I don't know how we'll be able to get word
to them.

1112
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,196
TRAVIS: You howl.

1113
01:14:53,196 --> 01:14:54,266
LAURA: All right.

1114
01:14:54,266 --> 01:15:00,284
MATT: Allura sneaks in a bit and says, "My only
suggestion here is make sure that you do the

1115
01:15:00,284 --> 01:15:04,908
"things that are absolutely necessary for <i>this</i>
because we don't know when <i>this</i> is going to kick off."

1116
01:15:04,908 --> 01:15:07,199
LAURA: Well, we have to get armies here.

1117
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:08,320
MATT: "Then let's do it."

1118
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:09,445
LAURA: That's what we're trying to do.

1119
01:15:09,445 --> 01:15:10,473
MATT: "All right."

1120
01:15:10,473 --> 01:15:14,446
SAM: Well, wait. Don't we need to send word to
other places as well? How do we do that?

1121
01:15:14,446 --> 01:15:17,285
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't know how to reach my herd.

1122
01:15:17,285 --> 01:15:20,149
SAM: Isn't there a big horn you blow or
something?

1123
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:23,110
TRAVIS: No, they wander to and fro.

1124
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:24,867
SAM: You could find them, probably?

1125
01:15:24,867 --> 01:15:28,649
LAURA: They were wandering somewhere specific,
though. Into the riverlands or something?

1126
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:34,123
SAM: We can scry and find out where they are and
then send someone as mist-form you, or something,

1127
01:15:34,123 --> 01:15:36,003
and go catch up with them.

1128
01:15:36,003 --> 01:15:44,237
LAURA: We'll spread the fuck out and then Thordak
will attack and then none of us will be here!

1129
01:15:44,237 --> 01:15:45,535
MARISHA: All right.

1130
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:49,285
TALIESIN: Stop rolling, that's really
disconcerting when you sit there and roll at us.

1131
01:15:49,285 --> 01:15:53,741
MARISHA: Well, how do we know that Thordak will
even come here, by the way? He has no reason to

1132
01:15:53,741 --> 01:15:58,101
come here unless he's deliberately looking for us.
Which we have no reason to believe that he cares

1133
01:15:58,101 --> 01:15:59,935
to come find us.

1134
01:15:59,935 --> 01:16:05,135
SAM: Quick list, people. Quick list! Who do we
need to contact, Slayer's Take?

1135
01:16:05,135 --> 01:16:09,562
LAURA: -Ish. Yeah. Bottom of the list, because I
don't think they would--

1136
01:16:09,562 --> 01:16:10,675
SAM: Ravenites?

1137
01:16:10,675 --> 01:16:11,705
LAURA: Yes.

1138
01:16:11,705 --> 01:16:12,735
LIAM: Syngorn.

1139
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:15,408
SAM: Syngorn. That's a big one. That's a biggie
right there.

1140
01:16:15,408 --> 01:16:17,341
LAURA: And that's a biggie because it's also got
these soldiers.

1141
01:16:17,341 --> 01:16:19,148
SAM: The wolf pack?

1142
01:16:19,148 --> 01:16:20,949
LAURA: Also there. We can howl.

1143
01:16:20,949 --> 01:16:22,033
TRAVIS: The Herd.

1144
01:16:22,033 --> 01:16:24,098
SAM: The Herd.

1145
01:16:24,098 --> 01:16:25,675
TRAVIS: The Platinum Dragon.

1146
01:16:25,675 --> 01:16:27,719
LAURA: Bahamut?

1147
01:16:27,719 --> 01:16:29,446
SAM: J'mon Sa Ord, sort of? -Ish?

1148
01:16:29,446 --> 01:16:30,669
MARISHA: We've got that thing--

1149
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:40,164
LAURA: Yeah, we've got that whistle. What about
Bahamut's people in Vasselheim?

1150
01:16:40,164 --> 01:16:41,845
MATT: That's the Platinum Sanctuary.

1151
01:16:41,845 --> 01:16:44,189
LAURA: Yeah, what about the Platinum Sanctuary?

1152
01:16:44,189 --> 01:16:45,570
TRAVIS: That's what I'm saying.

1153
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:47,152
LAURA: Oh, I thought you were talking about--

1154
01:16:47,152 --> 01:16:54,914
TRAVIS: No, no. I said the word "platinum." I was
there. And you robbed me of it. I did it right.

1155
01:16:54,914 --> 01:16:57,370
LAURA: Sorry, Grog. You're so smart!

1156
01:16:57,370 --> 01:17:02,439
SAM: Is there anyone else who's pledged their
allegiance to us? Any other band of traveling

1157
01:17:02,439 --> 01:17:03,796
idiots?

1158
01:17:03,796 --> 01:17:06,316
TALIESIN: We could ask for help from Kraghammer,
as well.

1159
01:17:06,316 --> 01:17:07,830
LAURA: Yeah, it's so close.

1160
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:14,982
MARISHA: I could ask, potentially, my father and
the Air Ashari. I'd have a hard time asking the

1161
01:17:14,982 --> 01:17:17,291
Fire Ashari, there's so few of them.

1162
01:17:17,291 --> 01:17:21,346
TRAVIS: Didn't the werewolves want to leave the
Feywild, right? They wanted <i>out.</i>

1163
01:17:21,346 --> 01:17:27,033
LAURA: I think so. I don't know. I think they just
wanted out of those woods, but-- Maybe we could

1164
01:17:27,033 --> 01:17:31,435
find Artagan while we're there. Maybe he could pop
over and we'll have an archfey helping us.

1165
01:17:31,435 --> 01:17:35,606
MARISHA: We also have a 2,000 person capacity
here. I mean, we can always push it and make

1166
01:17:35,606 --> 01:17:40,185
encampments on the outside, but what's our ideal
number we're trying to hit?

1167
01:17:40,185 --> 01:17:41,454
SAM: 2,000.

1168
01:17:41,454 --> 01:17:43,462
LAURA: A jillion. As many as we can.

1169
01:17:43,462 --> 01:17:48,932
LIAM: It feels like it's a risk, but the most bang
for our buck, our gold piece, is Syngorn. There's the

1170
01:17:48,932 --> 01:17:50,098
most people there.

1171
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:55,297
TRAVIS: And as far as we remember, the people of
Vasselheim. Their general temperament is

1172
01:17:55,297 --> 01:17:57,291
Vasselheim takes care of Vasselheim.

1173
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:59,386
LIAM: Yeah, that's what it felt like when we were
there.

1174
01:17:59,386 --> 01:18:08,602
MATT: Vasselheim and the continuation of
civilization, and that being the Dawn Cradle, the

1175
01:18:08,602 --> 01:18:14,572
city that's existed for as long as civilization
has, is to be protected at all costs. So while

1176
01:18:14,572 --> 01:18:20,077
they do and can offer aid occasionally outside of
it, not to the detriment of their own defense.

1177
01:18:20,077 --> 01:18:21,302
TRAVIS: Right.

1178
01:18:21,302 --> 01:18:24,328
LAURA: Is that it? Is that everyone?

1179
01:18:24,328 --> 01:18:29,023
TRAVIS: We could go talk to that Earthbreaker
Groon.

1180
01:18:29,023 --> 01:18:30,923
SAM: Where is he?

1181
01:18:30,923 --> 01:18:35,681
LAURA: Vasselheim. This is a lot of different
places in like a day and a half.

1182
01:18:35,681 --> 01:18:39,025
TALIESIN: We could write an awful lot of letters.

1183
01:18:39,025 --> 01:18:44,377
LAURA: Yeah. And hopefully they'll show up like
Game of Thrones at the last moment. We'll think

1184
01:18:44,377 --> 01:18:48,484
we're overrun, and then all of a sudden another
army shows up, and it's wonderful!

1185
01:18:48,484 --> 01:18:52,767
MARISHA: Allura, do you have some way of messaging
people and sending messages like super quickly?

1186
01:18:52,767 --> 01:18:54,644
SAM: An instant message app?

1187
01:18:54,644 --> 01:18:56,689
MATT: "Actually, depending on who it is."

1188
01:18:56,689 --> 01:19:04,350
TALIESIN: Fassbender?

1189
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:08,175
MARISHA: Fassbender. He's with Wilhand.

1190
01:19:08,175 --> 01:19:14,172
MATT: "To be perfectly honest, if it's a creature
that I'm relatively familiar with, I could send it

1191
01:19:14,172 --> 01:19:19,382
"to them instantaneously. Any distance. Across the
planes."

1192
01:19:19,382 --> 01:19:21,305
SAM: How many people per day?

1193
01:19:21,305 --> 01:19:22,268
MARISHA: Across the planes?

1194
01:19:22,268 --> 01:19:23,287
MATT: "Across the planes."

1195
01:19:23,287 --> 01:19:24,897
SAM: How many times could you do that per day?

1196
01:19:24,897 --> 01:19:28,585
MATT: I could probably muster it three times.

1197
01:19:28,585 --> 01:19:31,989
LAURA: Oh, this is major! This is huge!

1198
01:19:31,989 --> 01:19:34,972
LIAM: Allura, did you ever meet with our father in
Emon?

1199
01:19:34,972 --> 01:19:42,821
MATT: "Yes, many times, actually. Yes, he was an
interesting individual of the council. Especially

1200
01:19:42,821 --> 01:19:48,955
"back when Sir Gregory was with us. But they were
friends. Yes, I did meet him."

1201
01:19:48,955 --> 01:19:54,485
TALIESIN: Well, dwell on that one. Well, that
would save us an enormous amount of energy.

1202
01:19:54,485 --> 01:19:57,554
MARISHA: That would be great! And me, two
seventh-level spells.

1203
01:19:57,554 --> 01:20:00,708
MATT: Sir Gregory Fence. That was when you first
came to Emon. He's the gentleman who was part of

1204
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:04,822
the council. You were hired by their father to go
and inspect because he went missing.

1205
01:20:04,822 --> 01:20:06,951
LAURA: Remember demons in the succubus' house?

1206
01:20:06,951 --> 01:20:13,126
MARISHA: It'll take me a 7th-level spell to get
there, and then I'll have to burn my 8th-level

1207
01:20:13,126 --> 01:20:14,572
spell to get back.

1208
01:20:14,572 --> 01:20:18,262
LAURA: Well let's send word to them. Then save us
the talk.

1209
01:20:18,262 --> 01:20:21,842
MATT: "All right, so. You require word to your
father?"

1210
01:20:21,842 --> 01:20:23,140
LAURA: Yes.

1211
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:24,425
MATT: "Who else?"

1212
01:20:24,425 --> 01:20:26,610
SAM: Who's next on the list?

1213
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:28,921
MARISHA: Bigger allies.

1214
01:20:28,921 --> 01:20:31,855
SAM: The Ravenites? The Herd. What about the
Herd?

1215
01:20:31,855 --> 01:20:33,193
MARISHA: I don't think she knows anyone.

1216
01:20:33,193 --> 01:20:34,813
SAM: Well, we can describe them?

1217
01:20:34,813 --> 01:20:38,115
LAURA: It's got to be somebody she knows.

1218
01:20:38,115 --> 01:20:41,862
MATT: "I have to have met them."

1219
01:20:41,862 --> 01:20:43,956
SAM: Kraghammer?

1220
01:20:43,956 --> 01:20:47,455
LAURA: Have you ever met somebody in charge in
Kraghammer?

1221
01:20:47,455 --> 01:20:53,430
MATT: "I have a number of individuals I've met
there, yes. I cannot guarantee they'll be eager to

1222
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:56,398
"jump into this fray. I can try."

1223
01:20:56,398 --> 01:20:59,144
TALIESIN: That's possible, let's put that on the
possible list.

1224
01:20:59,144 --> 01:21:03,994
SAM: What about that town that we saved from
dissolution?

1225
01:21:03,994 --> 01:21:05,889
TALIESIN: Westruun, they have the--

1226
01:21:05,889 --> 01:21:08,547
MARISHA: Westruun was decimated.

1227
01:21:08,547 --> 01:21:11,289
TALIESIN: They have Fassbender, they could send a
soldier with the Fassbender.

1228
01:21:11,289 --> 01:21:13,703
LAURA: Yeah, they have Fassbender.

1229
01:21:13,703 --> 01:21:16,698
SAM: The Air Ashari? Do we need to talk to any of
them? You could do that.

1230
01:21:16,698 --> 01:21:20,009
MARISHA: Theoretically.

1231
01:21:20,009 --> 01:21:25,012
SAM: The Ravenites? You don't know any Ravenites,
do you?

1232
01:21:25,012 --> 01:21:36,418
MARISHA: I was going to say, what about Tooma?
Who's the dragonborn in Vasselheim?

1233
01:21:36,418 --> 01:21:37,650
LIAM: Tofor!

1234
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:38,441
MARISHA: Tofor!

1235
01:21:38,441 --> 01:21:39,766
LAURA: Wow, nice pull!

1236
01:21:39,766 --> 01:21:41,395
MARISHA: Do you know Tofor?

1237
01:21:41,395 --> 01:21:44,313
MATT: "Tofor? Yes. Tofor's in Emon right now. "

1238
01:21:44,313 --> 01:21:46,724
TRAVIS: She is?

1239
01:21:46,724 --> 01:21:48,348
LAURA: Yeah, she is.

1240
01:21:48,348 --> 01:21:53,529
MATT: Tofor is a member of the Tal'Dorei Council.
She's one of the council members, one of the

1241
01:21:53,529 --> 01:21:57,555
survivors who is currently working with--
apparently, from what you've heard--

1242
01:21:57,555 --> 01:21:58,632
LAURA: The Clasp.

1243
01:21:58,632 --> 01:22:01,478
MARISHA: Is the person at the Slayer's Take
Vanessa?

1244
01:22:01,478 --> 01:22:04,522
SAM: Vanessa, from the Slayer's Take, do you know
her, Allura?

1245
01:22:04,522 --> 01:22:06,861
MATT: "I've not met Vanessa, no."

1246
01:22:06,910 --> 01:22:11,570
LAURA: Well, who do you know that's really
powerful, that also maybe has an army that could

1247
01:22:11,570 --> 01:22:13,892
help us? Anyone you know that we don't?

1248
01:22:13,892 --> 01:22:20,091
MATT: "I think we've tapped out most of our
resources at this point! I've reached out to

1249
01:22:20,091 --> 01:22:25,678
"members of the Arcana Pansophical, but many of them
have their own issues to deal with."

1250
01:22:25,678 --> 01:22:27,389
LAURA: They're dicks, aren't they?

1251
01:22:27,389 --> 01:22:29,131
MATT: "No, they're just busy."

1252
01:22:29,131 --> 01:22:31,898
LAURA: Oh, that one guy we met, he was a real
dick, though.

1253
01:22:31,898 --> 01:22:39,054
SAM: Any underdark-y type people? Do they like
us?

1254
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:41,209
LIAM: Long, white hair.

1255
01:22:41,209 --> 01:22:47,603
LAURA: Purple eyes. He was in Marquet. Is that
what we're thinking of? Am I thinking of a

1256
01:22:47,603 --> 01:22:49,339
different place?

1257
01:22:49,339 --> 01:22:51,521
MATT: "I don't know if he's a member of the
Arcana Pansophical."

1258
01:22:51,521 --> 01:22:53,071
LAURA: Just kidding!

1259
01:22:53,071 --> 01:22:56,501
SAM: Let's start with Syngorn and then see how it
works, all right?

1260
01:22:56,501 --> 01:23:00,652
MARISHA: Have you ever met my father, Korren of
the Air Ashari?

1261
01:23:00,652 --> 01:23:06,171
MATT: "I've had no correspondence from the Air
Ashari. My apologies. I'm doing what I can."

1262
01:23:06,171 --> 01:23:08,678
MARISHA: Yeah, no, you're great.

1263
01:23:08,678 --> 01:23:14,840
TALIESIN: You've saved us a trip to the Feywild
and back. Send word that if they can contact the

1264
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:19,241
werewolves, the werewolves owe us a favor, I
suppose. Not that they would help with that.

1265
01:23:19,241 --> 01:23:26,872
MATT: "If that's the information you need sent,
that would require me to make two messages. Just

1266
01:23:26,872 --> 01:23:29,749
"to cover both those bases. To their father--"

1267
01:23:29,749 --> 01:23:32,048
SAM: Let's just get the father.

1268
01:23:32,048 --> 01:23:33,476
MATT: "What was his name again?"

1269
01:23:33,476 --> 01:23:34,716
LIAM: Syldor.

1270
01:23:34,716 --> 01:23:42,097
MATT: "Syldor. Syldor, right. Two messages, to
gather the army of Emon. And Syngorn, to return

1271
01:23:42,097 --> 01:23:44,252
"and head towards Fort Daxio."

1272
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:48,224
LAURA: Yes, if they could get pop Syngorn over to
Fort Daxio, that'd be killer.

1273
01:23:48,224 --> 01:23:57,448
MATT: "I don't know if that's how the magic works,
but I'll put a message in there for that and to

1274
01:23:57,448 --> 01:23:59,562
"look for werewolves."

1275
01:23:59,562 --> 01:24:03,524
TALIESIN: As part of the message, that if there's
a pack with the werewolves---

1276
01:24:03,524 --> 01:24:05,309
SAM: Is that vital? Should we care about that?

1277
01:24:05,309 --> 01:24:06,876
TRAVIS: He fucked some shit up.

1278
01:24:06,876 --> 01:24:10,378
SAM: All right, sure. Yeah. Why not? Second
message: Bring-- what was his name?

1279
01:24:10,378 --> 01:24:14,160
TRAVIS: Spike!

1280
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:15,056
LAURA: No.

1281
01:24:15,056 --> 01:24:16,274
SAM: Indala.

1282
01:24:16,274 --> 01:24:17,860
LAURA: No.

1283
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:18,993
LIAM: Michael J. Fox.

1284
01:24:18,993 --> 01:24:20,431
TRAVIS: Ukurat.

1285
01:24:20,489 --> 01:24:21,779
LAURA and MARISHA: Ukurat!

1286
01:24:21,779 --> 01:24:28,168
MATT: "All right. And I'll enquire about bringing
Ukurat and the werewolves. All right! I've got

1287
01:24:28,168 --> 01:24:31,047
"some messaging to do."

1288
01:24:31,047 --> 01:24:36,974
TALIESIN: And when you're back in Whitestone, send
the airship our way loaded with food and supplies

1289
01:24:36,974 --> 01:24:38,381
if you can.

1290
01:24:38,381 --> 01:24:39,462
MATT: "Very well."

1291
01:24:39,462 --> 01:24:40,856
LAURA: Tell them to be on guard!

1292
01:24:40,856 --> 01:24:42,742
SAM: Put Kima on there, too?

1293
01:24:42,742 --> 01:24:44,769
TALIESIN: And anybody who wishes to come fight.

1294
01:24:44,769 --> 01:24:45,935
TRAVIS: Kash, Kima.

1295
01:24:45,935 --> 01:24:49,326
LAURA: On the airship? Or send them through a
tree.

1296
01:24:49,326 --> 01:24:50,506
SAM: Or Zahra!

1297
01:24:50,506 --> 01:24:55,264
LIAM: When you write to our father, will you tell
him his children need him?

1298
01:24:55,264 --> 01:24:58,085
TRAVIS: Gross!

1299
01:24:58,085 --> 01:24:59,523
MATT: "I can do that, yes."

1300
01:24:59,523 --> 01:25:01,933
LAURA: I don't know if that will help at all.

1301
01:25:01,933 --> 01:25:08,872
MATT: "I'll call for Kima, I'll bring our allies
with us. Either me or Shaun have to stay behind to

1302
01:25:08,872 --> 01:25:11,932
"maintain the illusion, so your choice."

1303
01:25:11,932 --> 01:25:13,939
SAM: Shaun.

1304
01:25:13,939 --> 01:25:15,231
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1305
01:25:15,231 --> 01:25:17,282
MATT: "All right, so Shaun will stay behind--"

1306
01:25:17,282 --> 01:25:18,154
SAM: Wait.

1307
01:25:18,154 --> 01:25:19,192
TALIESIN: <i>Yes</i>.

1308
01:25:19,192 --> 01:25:20,745
LAURA: Yeah.

1309
01:25:20,745 --> 01:25:23,481
SAM: That's certain death.

1310
01:25:23,481 --> 01:25:26,709
TALIESIN: Staying in Whitestone is the exact
opposite of certain death.

1311
01:25:26,709 --> 01:25:28,162
LAURA: He's protecting everyone.

1312
01:25:28,162 --> 01:25:30,937
MATT: "Our purpose is to stay to make sure that
they do not <i>see</i> Whitestone."

1313
01:25:30,937 --> 01:25:33,708
TALIESIN: That is the opposite of certain death.

1314
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:37,089
MATT: "All right, I'll get these messages off."

1315
01:25:37,089 --> 01:25:40,203
LAURA: Oh my god is this happening right now?

1316
01:25:40,203 --> 01:25:44,016
MATT: She takes two steps back and puts one
finger in the air, and as it curls her eyes glaze

1317
01:25:44,016 --> 01:25:48,170
over with crackling blue energy. And you watch her
tongue click across her mouth like she's speaking

1318
01:25:48,170 --> 01:25:58,514
quietly to herself. Her eyes come back. "All
right, I've notified your father, Syldor." Once

1319
01:25:58,514 --> 01:26:02,945
again her eyes glaze over with crackling blue
energy. Her fingers trace in the air, and it looks

1320
01:26:02,945 --> 01:26:04,502
like she's speaking--

1321
01:26:04,502 --> 01:26:07,080
SAM: Quick, everyone hide when she's doing this!
So when she comes back, we'll all be--

1322
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,284
TRAVIS: <i>Yes</i>.

1323
01:26:08,284 --> 01:26:11,363
LAURA: She goes back we're like--

1324
01:26:11,363 --> 01:26:15,803
LIAM: It's like she's putting on a VR helmet.

1325
01:26:15,803 --> 01:26:21,676
MATT: "All right." Her eyes return. "Both messages
have been delivered to your father. Who else

1326
01:26:21,676 --> 01:26:23,461
"should require a message?"

1327
01:26:23,461 --> 01:26:27,578
SAM: You don't know anyone else on our list, do
you? The Slayer's Take, you don't know.

1328
01:26:27,578 --> 01:26:33,882
LAURA: It might be smart to send one to Warmaster
Mikael as well. I know he's in Syngorn as well,

1329
01:26:33,882 --> 01:26:37,412
but it might be good to have a couple of people
there bringing word.

1330
01:26:37,412 --> 01:26:38,725
LIAM: That's not a bad idea.

1331
01:26:38,725 --> 01:26:43,242
MATT: "I can do that." With that, once again the
energy crackles and you can see she's trying to

1332
01:26:43,242 --> 01:26:47,933
find the location of someone's presence. It hits,
and she begins to speak quietly to herself.

1333
01:26:47,933 --> 01:26:51,913
Finishes. "Very well! The army's been notified."

1334
01:26:51,913 --> 01:26:54,496
SAM: Just <i>one</i> more message!

1335
01:26:54,496 --> 01:26:58,818
MATT: Let me see if she can.

1336
01:26:58,818 --> 01:27:01,903
SAM: But wait, what about the Clasp or something?

1337
01:27:01,903 --> 01:27:05,926
MATT: Nope! That is all that she can do. Actually,
no. She can cast at a higher level, so she can do more.

1338
01:27:05,926 --> 01:27:08,889
SAM: The Clasp? Do they like us or hate us?

1339
01:27:08,889 --> 01:27:10,431
LAURA: They hate us, but--

1340
01:27:10,431 --> 01:27:15,494
TALIESIN: I think that the Clasp are going to be
far more useful once they figure out the dragon

1341
01:27:15,494 --> 01:27:20,420
has left the city. And I don't even think they
necessarily need to be notified of such a thing.

1342
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:23,692
LAURA: <i>If</i> the dragon leaves the city.

1343
01:27:23,692 --> 01:27:31,834
SAM: All right, then we're good for now. We just
keep buffeting up this place? Do we have to plan

1344
01:27:31,834 --> 01:27:33,702
an ambush? How does this work?

1345
01:27:33,702 --> 01:27:36,338
TRAVIS: We go in. Emon, right now. Full ball.

1346
01:27:36,338 --> 01:27:37,750
SAM: All right. You and me.

1347
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:38,944
TRAVIS: Full blush.

1348
01:27:38,944 --> 01:27:40,823
TALIESIN: We could go to the Fire Plane really
quickly.

1349
01:27:40,823 --> 01:27:44,106
LIAM: We're hoping to tempt him here.

1350
01:27:44,106 --> 01:27:45,223
LAURA: Yeah.

1351
01:27:45,223 --> 01:27:46,226
TALIESIN: Yes.

1352
01:27:46,226 --> 01:27:48,814
TRAVIS: Why are you so anxious to go to the Fire
Plane all of a sudden?

1353
01:27:48,814 --> 01:27:55,452
TALIESIN: There's an object. It's from the Fire
Plane. We are facing a fire dragon, which means

1354
01:27:55,452 --> 01:28:02,361
it's something unbelievably useful or not useful
at all. We need ice weapons, we need cold weapons,

1355
01:28:02,361 --> 01:28:04,146
and we don't have any.

1356
01:28:04,146 --> 01:28:06,648
MARISHA: And you think that we're going to find
those in the Fire Plane?

1357
01:28:06,648 --> 01:28:08,868
TALIESIN: Either that or in that ship that we left
behind.

1358
01:28:08,868 --> 01:28:15,474
MATT: You have knowledge of dragons quite well,
actually, Vex. You do know that red dragons are

1359
01:28:15,474 --> 01:28:19,213
not vulnerable to cold, by any means. They're just
resistant to fire.

1360
01:28:19,213 --> 01:28:20,917
LAURA: They're just resistant to fire.

1361
01:28:20,917 --> 01:28:22,033
TALIESIN: So it doesn't matter, then.

1362
01:28:22,033 --> 01:28:25,763
LAURA: Are they vulnerable to anything that i know
of?

1363
01:28:25,763 --> 01:28:27,147
TRAVIS: Insults, cheese.

1364
01:28:27,147 --> 01:28:28,503
ASHLEY: Love.

1365
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:30,391
MARISHA: Peanuts.

1366
01:28:30,391 --> 01:28:31,788
TRAVIS: Bruised bananas.

1367
01:28:31,788 --> 01:28:34,013
MATT: (laughs) Bruised bananas.

1368
01:28:34,013 --> 01:28:41,220
TRAVIS: Hey, Pike! Did you know that we have all
the Vestiges except for the one in the Fire Plane,

1369
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:43,309
and you'll never guess what it is.

1370
01:28:43,309 --> 01:28:44,824
ASHLEY: What is it?

1371
01:28:44,824 --> 01:28:46,163
TRAVIS: What is it? I forgot.

1372
01:28:46,163 --> 01:28:47,566
SAM: Some plate armor?

1373
01:28:47,566 --> 01:28:48,724
TRAVIS: It's some plate armor!

1374
01:28:48,724 --> 01:28:49,964
LAURA: Of the Dawn Martyr.

1375
01:28:49,964 --> 01:28:51,164
ASHLEY: What?!

1376
01:28:51,164 --> 01:28:52,863
LAURA: Which might be clutch for you.

1377
01:28:52,863 --> 01:28:58,340
ASHLEY: That might be a long-- I don't know.
Allura was saying we don't have time--

1378
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:00,679
SAM: One day! What's one day?

1379
01:29:00,679 --> 01:29:02,715
MARISHA: You don't know if it's going to be one
day.

1380
01:29:02,715 --> 01:29:06,822
SAM: Well, when we get there we'll find out! If
it's taking too long, we'll pop back! These

1381
01:29:06,822 --> 01:29:08,810
messages are going to take a while to deliver.

1382
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:10,820
MARISHA: I'm not like a Wonka-vator, man!

1383
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:12,735
LAURA: We'd have to spend the night there.

1384
01:29:12,735 --> 01:29:14,528
ASHLEY: That makes me a little nervous.

1385
01:29:14,528 --> 01:29:17,343
SAM: All right, one night. They've all eaten
today. We're fine.

1386
01:29:17,343 --> 01:29:21,430
MATT: As far as you know, no there is no
vulnerability--

1387
01:29:21,430 --> 01:29:22,644
LAURA: Fuck, really?

1388
01:29:22,644 --> 01:29:24,948
MATT: Just fine with fire.

1389
01:29:24,948 --> 01:29:27,060
TRAVIS: Just pure death and destruction.

1390
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:31,186
TALIESIN: Well, at least that's a bonus in that
means that anything will work as well as anything else.

1391
01:29:31,186 --> 01:29:32,453
TRAVIS: That's true.

1392
01:29:32,453 --> 01:29:33,426
LAURA: Right.

1393
01:29:33,426 --> 01:29:37,240
LIAM: Can we go back to the plan about how we
intend to get Thordak here? We were playing with

1394
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:41,240
the idea of fooling Thordak into thinking that
Raishan had been killed.

1395
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:45,181
TALIESIN: Raishan was going to feed him the
information that he thought that we were here, and

1396
01:29:45,181 --> 01:29:46,526
then vanish.

1397
01:29:46,526 --> 01:29:49,898
LIAM: And that's it? We think <i>that's</i> going to
pull him out?

1398
01:29:49,898 --> 01:29:53,535
TALIESIN: I think Raishan will be clever enough to
give him just enough to get him here.

1399
01:29:53,535 --> 01:30:00,456
LIAM: Do you think Raishan would be willing to let
us hack off a little bit of flesh to send?

1400
01:30:00,456 --> 01:30:02,967
LAURA: You'd have to ask Raishan.

1401
01:30:02,967 --> 01:30:06,935
TALIESIN: You'd have to ask Raishan. She might be
willing to let me do such a thing.

1402
01:30:06,935 --> 01:30:09,575
TRAVIS: Did we establish a way to contact her?

1403
01:30:09,575 --> 01:30:12,408
MARISHA: We have no way to contact her.

1404
01:30:12,408 --> 01:30:14,197
SAM: No wait! Didn't we send her on a mission?

1405
01:30:14,197 --> 01:30:16,888
TRAVIS: Oh, we did! She was checking on--

1406
01:30:16,888 --> 01:30:21,906
SAM: She was going to bring us back some dude. And
we're not even there!

1407
01:30:21,906 --> 01:30:23,668
LAURA: Oh, fuck! Asum was going to come back!

1408
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:25,254
SAM: To not where we are right now!

1409
01:30:25,254 --> 01:30:26,330
LAURA: Fuck.

1410
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:29,012
TRAVIS: It was two things. It was Asoon and...

1411
01:30:29,012 --> 01:30:30,427
LIAM: Asoon?

1412
01:30:30,427 --> 01:30:35,401
TRAVIS: Bassoon, whatever. And what was the other
thing?

1413
01:30:35,401 --> 01:30:38,336
LAURA: Some other guy. Was it some other guy?

1414
01:30:38,336 --> 01:30:39,363
TRAVIS: Oh, shit nails!

1415
01:30:39,363 --> 01:30:42,564
SAM: The last time we talked to Raishan she said,
"All right. I'll be back in a day." And then we

1416
01:30:42,564 --> 01:30:43,795
got out of there.

1417
01:30:43,795 --> 01:30:47,587
LAURA: Well it's still a day. It hasn't been a day
yet. We haven't spent the night here yet.

1418
01:30:47,587 --> 01:30:51,209
SAM: Yeah, no. We haven't spent the night yet.

1419
01:30:51,209 --> 01:30:55,876
TRAVIS: Oh she was going to Emon to hold up the
bluff that everything was cool was Thordak, right?

1420
01:30:55,876 --> 01:30:59,827
She was going to bluff, and then she was also
going to try to bring back Seeker Asum.

1421
01:30:59,827 --> 01:31:01,961
TALIESIN: It's all right. We can head home from
here. Someone has got to go home.

1422
01:31:01,961 --> 01:31:03,032
LAURA: Somebody's got to go.

1423
01:31:03,032 --> 01:31:04,805
MARISHA: Some of us can go, and some of us can
stay.

1424
01:31:04,805 --> 01:31:06,250
LAURA: Well, all right.

1425
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:08,743
SAM: All right, I'll go talk to Raishan.

1426
01:31:08,743 --> 01:31:13,820
LIAM: And you can't leave because you're building,
or can you go?

1427
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:18,319
TALIESIN: I can leave, we've got one working. If I
stay, I'll have two working. If I stay longer,

1428
01:31:18,319 --> 01:31:21,807
I'll have three working. But I'll go where we're
most useful.

1429
01:31:21,807 --> 01:31:24,893
ASHLEY: But you want a chunk of her? Or like, a
little piece of her?

1430
01:31:24,893 --> 01:31:32,374
LIAM: Something, like a claw or something to drop
at Thordak's feet. It'll help with the bluff.

1431
01:31:32,374 --> 01:31:37,508
MARISHA: What makes you think that he would lead
the charge to come find us? In his eyes he could

1432
01:31:37,508 --> 01:31:39,701
just send one of his peons to come smash us.

1433
01:31:39,701 --> 01:31:40,757
TRAVIS: Thordak?

1434
01:31:40,757 --> 01:31:41,576
MARISHA: Yeah.

1435
01:31:41,576 --> 01:31:43,508
TALIESIN: He's sent all of his dragons and
nothing's worked.

1436
01:31:43,508 --> 01:31:46,450
LAURA: That's the goal. We kill the peons, and
then he comes.

1437
01:31:46,450 --> 01:31:48,585
TALIESIN: And the more he sends, the more we
kill.

1438
01:31:48,585 --> 01:31:52,928
TRAVIS: What if we go mess up something on the
edge of Emon, and then we're like, "Yeah! Fuck you!"

1439
01:31:52,928 --> 01:31:55,858
And then we take off. Or like bamf back.

1440
01:31:55,858 --> 01:31:58,554
TALIESIN: I don't believe he'll suffer that much
indignity.

1441
01:31:58,554 --> 01:32:05,920
MARISHA: If we tell Thordak where we are he'll
probably come with that wyvern army that almost

1442
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,492
took out Whitestone, correct?

1443
01:32:07,492 --> 01:32:11,013
LAURA: That's why we need to have a lot of people
here. To fight them.

1444
01:32:11,013 --> 01:32:12,508
TRAVIS: Yeah, to balance that out.

1445
01:32:12,508 --> 01:32:15,611
TALIESIN: And that also means that the Clasp will
have an opportunity to take back the city.

1446
01:32:15,611 --> 01:32:17,924
MARISHA: While he's gone?

1447
01:32:17,924 --> 01:32:24,292
TALIESIN: If he leaves with his army, yes. If he
leaves his army to actually manage the city--

1448
01:32:24,292 --> 01:32:25,875
LAURA: That's what we talked about.

1449
01:32:25,875 --> 01:32:28,283
TALIESIN: Either way, it's stretching him thin.

1450
01:32:28,283 --> 01:32:32,904
TRAVIS: Is it a bit of a practice round if we go
to the Fire Plane? Let's say we get there and it's

1451
01:32:32,904 --> 01:32:38,290
a total shit show, right? Nothing but death
waiting for us. We change our mind, we leave. But

1452
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:41,003
at least we see where Thordak's been all this
time.

1453
01:32:41,003 --> 01:32:46,292
MARISHA: And the other thing that we could glean
from the fire realm is possibly figuring out a

1454
01:32:46,292 --> 01:32:54,969
little bit more about the connection he had with
it and to the heart stone, ember seed thing?

1455
01:32:54,969 --> 01:33:04,146
LAURA: All right. Allura, can you send a message
to Gilmore, or Cassandra, or Kima even? Maybe just

1456
01:33:04,146 --> 01:33:09,638
those three. They're the only ones who know about
Raishan. Let them know that Raishan is bringing

1457
01:33:09,638 --> 01:33:11,158
back Asum.

1458
01:33:11,158 --> 01:33:12,800
TALIESIN: They were there.

1459
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:16,247
LAURA: I know, but just to make sure everything's
fine with that.

1460
01:33:16,247 --> 01:33:17,746
MATT: "I can do that, yes."

1461
01:33:17,746 --> 01:33:21,123
SAM: And then we're going to the Fire Plane?

1462
01:33:21,123 --> 01:33:22,842
TRAVIS: Yeah. Just give it a look-see.

1463
01:33:22,842 --> 01:33:25,472
SAM: Just pop on down for a bit to the basement.

1464
01:33:25,472 --> 01:33:27,686
TRAVIS: Yeah! I've got a timeshare there. It will
be killer.

1465
01:33:27,686 --> 01:33:30,864
MARISHA: I'd like to bring Raishan with us to the
Fire Plane.

1466
01:33:30,864 --> 01:33:32,239
SAM: No fucking way.

1467
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:34,762
LAURA: No. What are we going to do? She's not
going to come.

1468
01:33:34,762 --> 01:33:36,354
TALIESIN: She's not going to come to the Fire
Plane.

1469
01:33:36,354 --> 01:33:38,097
MARISHA: She knows it better than anybody else.

1470
01:33:38,097 --> 01:33:43,942
TALIESIN: She's not going to come to the Fire
Plane. But you're right, she does. If I were her I

1471
01:33:43,942 --> 01:33:45,107
wouldn't come.

1472
01:33:45,107 --> 01:33:46,526
LAURA: Would you want to go, Allura?

1473
01:33:46,526 --> 01:33:54,267
MATT: "What, to the Fire Plane? I mean, I can. My
skills are probably better used elsewhere. But

1474
01:33:54,267 --> 01:33:56,305
"whatever you think is wisest."

1475
01:33:56,305 --> 01:33:59,701
TALIESIN: We need agents on the ground right now.

1476
01:33:59,701 --> 01:34:00,754
TRAVIS: True.

1477
01:34:00,754 --> 01:34:02,072
LAURA: All right.

1478
01:34:02,072 --> 01:34:03,707
TALIESIN: Things need to move forward here.

1479
01:34:03,707 --> 01:34:05,899
LAURA: Okay, then you stay here and keep running
things.

1480
01:34:05,899 --> 01:34:09,544
TALIESIN: If opportunities present themselves to
bring more people here or to gather more allies,

1481
01:34:09,544 --> 01:34:10,835
take them.

1482
01:34:10,835 --> 01:34:12,797
SAM: Let's pop on down!

1483
01:34:12,797 --> 01:34:19,461
MARISHA: My gosh, you guys, the Dawn Martyr is in
the City of Brass. Which I'm pretty sure is

1484
01:34:19,461 --> 01:34:22,458
overrun with fire elementals.

1485
01:34:22,458 --> 01:34:29,688
TRAVIS: It's just a "myth," though, right? And
that was probably written a long time ago which

1486
01:34:29,688 --> 01:34:31,876
means shit could have totally changed.

1487
01:34:31,876 --> 01:34:35,150
SAM: Plus now we have a lot of money. We can buy
our way through the Fire Plane.

1488
01:34:35,150 --> 01:34:36,999
TALIESIN: That works.

1489
01:34:36,999 --> 01:34:40,357
LAURA: Is this stupid? Are we going to die in the
Fire Plane?

1490
01:34:40,357 --> 01:34:43,701
LIAM: I think it's a bad idea. I don't think we
have time.

1491
01:34:43,701 --> 01:34:45,513
TRAVIS: Never tell me the odds!

1492
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:50,166
LAURA: But there's a Vestige there for Pike.

1493
01:34:50,166 --> 01:34:53,205
MARISHA: I mean, we can go. We can hit the Fire
Ashari first and see if Cerkonos is there and

1494
01:34:53,205 --> 01:34:55,572
maybe see if Cerkonos wants to help us out?

1495
01:34:55,572 --> 01:35:00,458
LIAM: If we're all alive in two weeks I'd be happy
to go and get armor for Pike, but there's dragons

1496
01:35:00,458 --> 01:35:04,234
on top of our backs right now.

1497
01:35:04,234 --> 01:35:11,133
MARISHA: Allura, you're certain as soon as he
finds out about Vorugal's death that he's going to

1498
01:35:11,133 --> 01:35:12,637
seek retribution?

1499
01:35:12,637 --> 01:35:16,760
MATT: "I'm not certain, but as soon as he found
out about Umbrasyl's, that's when he sent things

1500
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:22,142
"looking for us near Whitestone. That was when
Vorugal and the rest of the armies swept through.

1501
01:35:22,142 --> 01:35:24,570
"That was two days after Umbrasyl's fall."

1502
01:35:24,570 --> 01:35:30,770
LIAM: We've also totally spilled our spaghetti
with Raishan. She's not going to wait, she's going

1503
01:35:30,770 --> 01:35:35,904
to push things forward. I don't think we have
time.

1504
01:35:35,904 --> 01:35:42,337
TRAVIS: All right, Vax. Do you have a suggestion
in place, then?

1505
01:35:42,337 --> 01:35:50,754
LIAM: I think that we talk to Raishan. These two
chuckle-heads convince her to let us take a pound

1506
01:35:50,754 --> 01:35:57,599
of her flesh, or ten. Somehow dump it insultingly
at Thordak's feet and brace for the worst.

1507
01:35:57,599 --> 01:36:00,419
TRAVIS: I'm okay with that, but how do we get in
touch with her?

1508
01:36:00,419 --> 01:36:06,154
SAM: We can get in touch with her when she goes
back to the place that shall not be named. But all

1509
01:36:06,154 --> 01:36:10,664
of that is going to take days. And we can't do
that until the armies have arrived here in Fort

1510
01:36:10,664 --> 01:36:16,263
Daxio, which could take another few days. I don't
know where Syngorn lands when it comes back to

1511
01:36:16,263 --> 01:36:20,691
this plane. I assume it's not next door. They're
going to take days to get here.

1512
01:36:20,691 --> 01:36:26,991
LAURA: The thing is, Thordak's going to send out
look-sees like he did over Whitestone, as soon as

1513
01:36:26,991 --> 01:36:30,544
he finds out Umbrasyl is dead. It doesn't mean
he'll launch an attack, because where is he going

1514
01:36:30,544 --> 01:36:33,033
to attack? He doesn't know where we are.

1515
01:36:33,033 --> 01:36:36,599
SAM: Yeah! And if he's searching for us, what
better place to be than on a different plane?

1516
01:36:36,599 --> 01:36:38,196
TRAVIS: Let's go to a different plane.

1517
01:36:38,196 --> 01:36:42,977
MARISHA: Do you think he went to the place which
shall not be named because Raishan tipped him off

1518
01:36:42,977 --> 01:36:44,684
that we were there?

1519
01:36:44,684 --> 01:36:46,104
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: No.

1520
01:36:46,104 --> 01:36:49,753
MARISHA: Why did he go to the place that shall not
be named, then? Why did he look there?

1521
01:36:49,753 --> 01:36:51,033
TRAVIS: Vorugal?

1522
01:36:51,033 --> 01:36:55,500
TALIESIN: It was a place to be looked at. And they
flew over and didn't see it.

1523
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:57,651
MARISHA: You think they were just scanning?

1524
01:36:57,651 --> 01:36:59,052
TALIESIN: I do.

1525
01:36:59,052 --> 01:37:02,266
SAM: All in favor of the Fire Plane, say "Aye."

1526
01:37:02,266 --> 01:37:04,257
SAM and TRAVIS: Aye!

1527
01:37:04,257 --> 01:37:06,506
SAM: That was only two! Wow, that's pretty rough.

1528
01:37:06,506 --> 01:37:10,300
TRAVIS: No, that was four. They're pansies and
won't say anything with their voice.

1529
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:12,004
ASHLEY: I don't know.

1530
01:37:12,004 --> 01:37:14,299
SAM: All in favor of staying say, "cooter."

1531
01:37:14,299 --> 01:37:16,859
TALIESIN: That's not fair.

1532
01:37:16,859 --> 01:37:21,280
SAM: Two to one.

1533
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:24,561
TRAVIS: Let's go! Even if it sucks, we can just
come right back.

1534
01:37:24,561 --> 01:37:25,888
LAURA: We just bamf right back!

1535
01:37:25,888 --> 01:37:28,842
MARISHA: We can always come back. And I would like
to maybe see if we could find out more about the

1536
01:37:28,842 --> 01:37:31,383
ember seed. Fire Plane!

1537
01:37:31,383 --> 01:37:34,202
LIAM: I mean there's nothing else we can do today,
is there?

1538
01:37:34,202 --> 01:37:35,343
TRAVIS: Right. No.

1539
01:37:35,343 --> 01:37:38,009
SAM: Feed more soldiers.

1540
01:37:38,009 --> 01:37:44,576
TALIESIN: Supplies are on the way. Soldiers are on
the way.

1541
01:37:44,576 --> 01:37:47,318
TRAVIS: Cows eat hay.

1542
01:37:47,318 --> 01:37:53,892
TALIESIN: Do what you can-- Cows eat hay, neigh neigh.
Hey! So we say.

1543
01:37:53,892 --> 01:37:58,519
LIAM: Gather ye rosebuds, while ye may. Vox
Machina is dying.

1544
01:37:58,519 --> 01:38:02,618
LAURA: If you hear back from anyone in Syngorn or
anyone anywhere, will you send us a message?

1545
01:38:02,618 --> 01:38:10,150
MATT: "Yes, and I will notify the general of these
plans before I head on that way. Very well. Good luck."

1546
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:13,454
LAURA: Pretend like we were never here. Let them
know. Pretend like we were never here.

1547
01:38:13,454 --> 01:38:14,661
MATT: "Understood."

1548
01:38:14,661 --> 01:38:15,731
LAURA: All right.

1549
01:38:15,731 --> 01:38:21,217
MATT: "Stay safe, friends." She turns and leaves
the room.

1550
01:38:21,217 --> 01:38:24,937
LAURA: We are so stupid. This is going to be fun.

1551
01:38:24,937 --> 01:38:26,279
TALIESIN: Yes! I love it.

1552
01:38:26,279 --> 01:38:27,530
TRAVIS: Do we hold hands again?

1553
01:38:27,530 --> 01:38:28,350
MARISHA: Oh boy!

1554
01:38:28,350 --> 01:38:29,471
LAURA: No, it's a tree stride.

1555
01:38:29,471 --> 01:38:32,540
MARISHA: Nope, well, okay. If we are--

1556
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:33,858
LIAM and SAM: Plane Shift.

1557
01:38:33,858 --> 01:38:38,365
MARISHA: Hang on, do we want to stop off at the
Fire Ashari, and pick up Cerkonos? I think it's

1558
01:38:38,365 --> 01:38:39,673
not a bad idea.

1559
01:38:39,673 --> 01:38:40,723
SAM: No.

1560
01:38:40,723 --> 01:38:45,354
MARISHA: We are <i>not</i> going to bring along our
ally who knows the Fire Plane better than anyone alive?

1561
01:38:45,354 --> 01:38:47,080
LAURA: No, I think we should. Because they were
there.

1562
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:49,691
LIAM: Yeah, and you said we can instantaneously
jump over, grab him, and shift--

1563
01:38:49,691 --> 01:38:53,160
MARISHA: Once I tree stride we can, there's that
portal there, and we can go through the portal.

1564
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:56,206
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. I am a big fan of the tour
guide.

1565
01:38:56,206 --> 01:39:01,690
MARISHA: The tour guide. All right. We're going to
tree stride to the Fire Ashari.

1566
01:39:01,690 --> 01:39:15,048
MATT: All right. Most of the trees near or within
the courtyard of the fort are thin, and maybe like

1567
01:39:15,048 --> 01:39:17,738
a foot to a half a foot wide, and--

1568
01:39:17,738 --> 01:39:19,787
ASHLEY: Get skinny, get skinny!

1569
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:34,894
MATT: You did see that cluster of brownish-red
forest canopy across the ravine. But that's the

1570
01:39:34,894 --> 01:39:36,314
only real--

1571
01:39:36,314 --> 01:39:37,590
MARISHA: Across the ravine?

1572
01:39:37,590 --> 01:39:38,915
MATT: Yeah, on the opposite side.

1573
01:39:38,915 --> 01:39:43,344
TRAVIS: Let's hoof it. I need to stretch my legs
anyway.

1574
01:39:43,344 --> 01:39:45,917
MARISHA: Well, how big was the ravine, like
crossing the Grand Canyon?

1575
01:39:45,917 --> 01:39:47,418
SAM: How long to get there?

1576
01:39:47,418 --> 01:39:54,685
MATT: It's about a third of the width of the Grand
Canyon, maybe? It's a big ravine.

1577
01:39:54,685 --> 01:40:03,451
LAURA: Can you Plane Shift us over to the Ashari?
It has to be to another plane.

1578
01:40:03,451 --> 01:40:05,275
MARISHA: It has to be to another plane.

1579
01:40:05,275 --> 01:40:08,142
LIAM: Scanlan, can you turn us into a bunch of
hummingbirds, or something?

1580
01:40:08,142 --> 01:40:10,440
SAM: I can turn a couple of us into some things.

1581
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:13,253
LAURA: Just something little? So that we can pop
to the tree?

1582
01:40:13,253 --> 01:40:14,594
SAM: You two can fly, right?

1583
01:40:14,594 --> 01:40:17,807
MATT: It would take you a handful of hours to walk
to this.

1584
01:40:17,807 --> 01:40:19,535
LAURA: Oh, yeah. So let's fucking do it.

1585
01:40:19,535 --> 01:40:20,643
TRAVIS: Told you.

1586
01:40:20,643 --> 01:40:24,816
MATT: At a brisk pace on foot you'll get there in
three hours.

1587
01:40:24,816 --> 01:40:29,493
TRAVIS: I put Pike on my shoulders because I'm
getting ready for my Rocky training montage.

1588
01:40:29,493 --> 01:40:32,468
TALIESIN: We'll get as many of us on the carpet as
possible.

1589
01:40:32,468 --> 01:40:34,467
MARISHA: (groans) RIP the carpet.

1590
01:40:34,467 --> 01:40:35,749
TALIESIN: You should feel bad!

1591
01:40:35,749 --> 01:40:37,013
LIAM: I should feel <i>bad</i>?

1592
01:40:37,013 --> 01:40:43,915
MATT: All right. You guys eventually make your way
to the outside of the forest here in the Othendin

1593
01:40:43,915 --> 01:40:51,822
Pass. You can see, it's a living forest. But the
trees themselves, it looks like there was a

1594
01:40:51,822 --> 01:40:56,435
waterfall that actually breaks down off the top of
the cliff that comes down and forms a small pool.

1595
01:40:56,435 --> 01:41:03,254
Most of it's dried up, but the ground here is
damp. And the forest does seem to exist in this

1596
01:41:03,254 --> 01:41:11,217
climate. However, a lot of the leaves have turned
and they're hitting the delayed end of winter, a

1597
01:41:11,217 --> 01:41:17,733
few months after the Winter's Crest Festival. You
find a number of trees that are perfectly

1598
01:41:17,733 --> 01:41:23,881
serviceable for your spellcasting. You guys wait
as Keyleth completes her ritual. You can see the

1599
01:41:23,881 --> 01:41:32,193
tree suddenly shifts open on the opposite end. You
can see the caldera itself, where the Pyrah Ashari

1600
01:41:32,193 --> 01:41:37,429
exist on the top of this mountainous volcano. You
all step through and find yourself now on the

1601
01:41:37,429 --> 01:41:43,045
cracked, dark, ashen ground landscape amongst the
various rock-like structures that house their

1602
01:41:43,045 --> 01:41:46,934
people. You can see the Cinder Grove in the
distance. Nowhere near as tumultuous as the last

1603
01:41:46,934 --> 01:41:54,800
time you encountered it. And you now stand amongst
the remaining Pyrah. You do now see the survivors

1604
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:58,379
that you met earlier, and a few other survivors
that previously had not been found have gathered.

1605
01:41:58,379 --> 01:42:02,513
And whereas previously you only thought maybe a
little over 20 existed, it looks like maybe

1606
01:42:02,513 --> 01:42:08,120
there's a good 50 or 60 that actually are
beginning to rebuild the Fire Ashari.

1607
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:12,167
TALIESIN: We're going to blow it up again, woo!
Table flip!

1608
01:42:12,167 --> 01:42:14,248
LAURA: Look at that! Keyleth! There's so many more
people than you thought!

1609
01:42:14,248 --> 01:42:15,695
MARISHA: There's still kids!

1610
01:42:15,695 --> 01:42:17,058
MATT: Like two.

1611
01:42:17,058 --> 01:42:21,235
MARISHA: Like two kids! One of those days they
might grow up.

1612
01:42:21,235 --> 01:42:24,032
TALIESIN: We're going to take like, 20 of them to
the fight. And they'll be fine.

1613
01:42:24,032 --> 01:42:26,187
MARISHA: (nervous laughter) Come on, kids! Have a
sword!

1614
01:42:26,187 --> 01:42:28,728
LIAM: That's a big "if."

1615
01:42:28,728 --> 01:42:34,251
MATT: It doesn't take you long to find Cerkonos,
who at this point in time has regrown his arm.

1616
01:42:34,251 --> 01:42:36,628
MARISHA: Yeah, I knew he'd be all right.

1617
01:42:36,628 --> 01:42:46,536
MATT: He approaches now, his darkened skin
tattooed, his long hair past his shoulders. He

1618
01:42:46,536 --> 01:42:53,737
approaches with an expression of surprise and mild
confusion. "It is good to to see all of you. I

1619
01:42:53,737 --> 01:42:58,079
"ask, what brings you to the doorstep of the Pyrah
Ashari?"

1620
01:42:58,079 --> 01:43:05,364
MARISHA: Cerkonos, Thordak has taken over Emon.
And in the time that he has broken out of the Fire

1621
01:43:05,364 --> 01:43:12,602
Plane, it seems there is a certain magic that is
allowing him to essentially turn Emon into a

1622
01:43:12,602 --> 01:43:21,622
second Fire Plane. We believe he still has some
sort of connection here based on the binding magic

1623
01:43:21,622 --> 01:43:26,287
that was used on him in the past. Something called
an ember seed. Have you heard of this?

1624
01:43:26,287 --> 01:43:35,028
MATT: "This does not stir my memory reserves. I'm
sorry."

1625
01:43:35,028 --> 01:43:43,163
MARISHA: Do you remember if Raishan, when she was
moving in and out of the Fire Plane, do you

1626
01:43:43,163 --> 01:43:49,140
remember her mentioning anything about it? Or
anything suspicious about wanting to learn about

1627
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:51,171
the connection to the Fire Plane?

1628
01:43:51,171 --> 01:44:00,889
MATT: "There were inquiries, yes. I was surprised
by one so young seemingly to be so interested in

1629
01:44:00,889 --> 01:44:13,954
"the inner and outer planes and their interactions.
She found much of her time in solace in the Cinder

1630
01:44:13,954 --> 01:44:23,957
"Grove. She was not quick to pick up the druidic
magics, but her research was in depth. She spoke

1631
01:44:23,957 --> 01:44:26,709
"with many elders, myself included."

1632
01:44:26,709 --> 01:44:32,022
MARISHA: Where is the Cinder Grove? Did we pass
through the Cinder Grove?

1633
01:44:32,022 --> 01:44:38,211
MATT: The Cinder Grove is in the center of the
caldera. That's the petrified forest that is

1634
01:44:38,211 --> 01:44:46,003
surrounding where the actual tear in the boundary
is. Where the Fire Ashari hold vigil.

1635
01:44:46,003 --> 01:44:53,265
LAURA: Wasn't the ember seed connected to the--
Didn't we knock down some pillars when we came to

1636
01:44:53,265 --> 01:44:59,088
the Fire Plane the last time? Isn't that part of
the reason his hold was broken?

1637
01:44:59,088 --> 01:45:07,522
MARISHA: It was opened more. The portal got weak
when it was around the solstice.

1638
01:45:07,522 --> 01:45:11,311
LAURA: Right. But remember, we were here for
your--

1639
01:45:11,311 --> 01:45:16,450
MARISHA: We fought Cerkonos, who was essentially a
giant elemental. I don't remember us breaking

1640
01:45:16,450 --> 01:45:17,544
anything.

1641
01:45:17,544 --> 01:45:24,077
MATT: No, when you first came here it was part of
your Aramente, and you guys just passed through

1642
01:45:24,077 --> 01:45:29,929
the tear. And you battled Cerkonos and the other
druids in elemental form as part of a test. There

1643
01:45:29,929 --> 01:45:31,744
was some stones on the other side but there was
nothing--

1644
01:45:31,744 --> 01:45:36,397
LAURA: Okay, maybe you just thought that and were
freaking out a bit.

1645
01:45:36,397 --> 01:45:45,163
MARISHA: Yeah, I got a little panicky at one
point. Yeah. Thordak was connected by the soul gem.

1646
01:45:45,163 --> 01:45:52,881
And we know he busted through. You know the Fire
Plane better than anyone. We are also looking for

1647
01:45:52,881 --> 01:45:58,040
the Plate of Dawnmartyr in the City of Brass.

1648
01:45:58,040 --> 01:46:03,701
MATT: When you say the City of Brass, you watch
his demeanor change. His arms cross, and he leans

1649
01:46:03,701 --> 01:46:23,874
back into himself. "That is not a place for the
Ashari. It is a place of tyranny and greed. It is

1650
01:46:23,874 --> 01:46:35,065
"a unique mix of those who exist there, and if you
are intent on going, I am happy to escort you, but

1651
01:46:35,065 --> 01:46:45,643
"it is a different experience than we are used to,
and perhaps yourself as well."

1652
01:46:45,643 --> 01:46:47,239
LAURA: Is it a large city?

1653
01:46:47,239 --> 01:46:48,861
MATT: "It is quite big, yes."

1654
01:46:48,861 --> 01:46:56,416
TALIESIN: This is the direst of situations.
Extreme measures must be taken.

1655
01:46:56,416 --> 01:46:59,741
MATT: "The choice is yours. You have come this
far."

1656
01:46:59,741 --> 01:47:02,810
MARISHA: How long is the journey to the City of
Brass?

1657
01:47:02,810 --> 01:47:14,056
MATT: "From the tear, it is about three days' foot
travel." Your Plane Shift spell can bring you

1658
01:47:14,056 --> 01:47:16,855
directly to a location as long as you're aware of
it.

1659
01:47:16,855 --> 01:47:18,040
MARISHA: Right.

1660
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:26,751
SAM: We can go right there. Be right in the center
of the city. Land right in Main Street, next to

1661
01:47:26,751 --> 01:47:28,776
the Reebok store.

1662
01:47:28,776 --> 01:47:32,099
LIAM: I have a sweater. I've hidden it in
Manhattan. Go find it.

1663
01:47:32,099 --> 01:47:35,036
(laughter)

1664
01:47:35,036 --> 01:47:38,776
MATT: Yeah.

1665
01:47:38,776 --> 01:47:42,729
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

1666
01:47:42,729 --> 01:47:48,613
LAURA: It feels like it's going to be really
hard.

1667
01:47:48,613 --> 01:47:56,826
TRAVIS: I mean, everything we do is, right? I mean
every time we've faced a dragon, we go find another

1668
01:47:56,826 --> 01:48:01,396
Vestige. It feels like the rhythm is right on
this. Let's go!

1669
01:48:01,396 --> 01:48:07,964
MARISHA: Here's the worst-case scenario though.
We're gone, we come back, Thordak has obliterated

1670
01:48:07,964 --> 01:48:10,668
everything, including Fort Daxio.

1671
01:48:10,668 --> 01:48:12,935
SAM: Yeah, but good news. We're still alive.

1672
01:48:12,935 --> 01:48:17,557
TRAVIS: We're alive! High-five, Scanlan!

1673
01:48:17,557 --> 01:48:21,487
TALIESIN: The stones don't work across planes, do
they?

1674
01:48:21,487 --> 01:48:23,953
LIAM: The gatestones? No.

1675
01:48:23,953 --> 01:48:31,296
TALIESIN: But Allura's ability to send messages
does.

1676
01:48:31,296 --> 01:48:35,500
MATT: This is true. From what she said, yes.

1677
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:40,367
TALIESIN: So if things start going very haywire,
we can let her know that she is to call us

1678
01:48:40,367 --> 01:48:42,140
immediately and we will drop what we're doing.

1679
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:44,236
SAM: She could probably figure that out on her
own.

1680
01:48:44,236 --> 01:48:49,219
LAURA: Yeah, whatever we're doing. Even if we're
in the middle of fighting some really big fire

1681
01:48:49,523 --> 01:48:50,860
elementals we just--

1682
01:48:50,860 --> 01:48:51,875
TALIESIN: Plane Shift.

1683
01:48:51,875 --> 01:48:53,903
LIAM: Of course, we'd have to get a message to her
to tell her that.

1684
01:48:53,903 --> 01:48:55,321
SAM: She would probably figure that out.

1685
01:48:55,321 --> 01:49:00,045
TRAVIS: Yeah, she'll figure it out. And we've
got an amazing tour guide. It's set up for us.

1686
01:49:00,045 --> 01:49:01,934
Can't fail. 0% APR.

1687
01:49:01,934 --> 01:49:09,588
LIAM: You big lovable lug. I still think it's a
very bad idea. I'll go if you all want to go.

1688
01:49:09,588 --> 01:49:15,943
MATT: Cerkonos turns to you, Grog, and says, "I do
not mean to be misunderstanding. I will take you

1689
01:49:15,943 --> 01:49:18,020
"to the city, but I will not enter it."

1690
01:49:18,020 --> 01:49:26,987
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm good with that. I mean you'll
take us there, right? You'll give us a couple of

1691
01:49:26,987 --> 01:49:30,987
warnings, maybe point at something if it's
terrible, and then you've got to go because it's

1692
01:49:30,987 --> 01:49:32,570
going to mess with you?

1693
01:49:32,570 --> 01:49:34,187
MATT: "I am of no use in that city."

1694
01:49:34,187 --> 01:49:38,615
TRAVIS: Now why is that, like you've got feelings
about it? Or you're afraid of it? Or you'll be

1695
01:49:38,615 --> 01:49:40,424
powerless there?

1696
01:49:40,424 --> 01:49:41,952
MATT: "Most of all of that."

1697
01:49:41,952 --> 01:49:43,091
TRAVIS: Powerless?

1698
01:49:43,091 --> 01:49:51,792
MATT: "There are many powerful entities that exist
in the city. I am not a man for cultured places."

1699
01:49:51,792 --> 01:49:53,110
TRAVIS: You've been before?

1700
01:49:53,110 --> 01:49:54,851
MATT: "I've been near."

1701
01:49:54,851 --> 01:49:59,773
SAM: Let's just pop in, pop out, guys. What could
go wrong?

1702
01:49:59,773 --> 01:50:06,776
TALIESIN: We're gathering forces at Fort Daxio to
fight this dragon. And if you can lend any of your

1703
01:50:06,776 --> 01:50:10,908
power, or have any power you can send, we'd be
forever grateful.

1704
01:50:10,908 --> 01:50:13,208
MARISHA: Do you think you could reach out to
Korren?

1705
01:50:13,208 --> 01:50:16,211
MATT: "I could. How soon?"

1706
01:50:16,211 --> 01:50:23,245
TALIESIN: Soon. That is where we will head
immediately when we are done here.

1707
01:50:23,245 --> 01:50:27,456
MATT: "All right. Then I will lead you, if you
choose to go to this city. And then I will call

1708
01:50:27,456 --> 01:50:32,041
"for your father, we will send what we can
spare."

1709
01:50:32,041 --> 01:50:35,306
MARISHA: Well, if you don't want to go inside, I
can Plane Shift us there. We don't necessarily

1710
01:50:35,306 --> 01:50:39,727
need you, I guess? I mean, we need you, but I'm
wondering if you'd be better here.

1711
01:50:39,727 --> 01:50:46,851
MATT: "No offense taken. If you wish to continue
your journey, I can go and try and round up the

1712
01:50:46,851 --> 01:50:48,920
"Ashari that can fight."

1713
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:50,181
SAM: Let's do that.

1714
01:50:50,181 --> 01:50:56,029
MARISHA: Do you know anything of where Thordak was
held?

1715
01:50:56,029 --> 01:51:04,337
MATT: "I did not know Thordak existed until he
tore through our people. So unfortunately not."

1716
01:51:04,337 --> 01:51:10,655
MARISHA: Is there anyone here left that Raishan
spoke to the most? A confidant? Someone who might

1717
01:51:10,655 --> 01:51:12,115
have been aiding her?

1718
01:51:12,115 --> 01:51:21,842
MATT: "It's hard to tell. Many who were near those
discussions were slain, I'm sorry."

1719
01:51:21,842 --> 01:51:26,152
MARISHA: Well, that's fair.

1720
01:51:26,152 --> 01:51:27,832
TRAVIS: We're good.

1721
01:51:27,832 --> 01:51:34,130
LAURA: Scanlan, will you be able to do the mansion
inside of the Fire Plane? Or did you already use it--

1722
01:51:34,130 --> 01:51:37,905
SAM: Sure, right? I can do my magic wherever. I
have no idea, I've never been to the Fire Plane.

1723
01:51:37,905 --> 01:51:39,935
LAURA: No, I mean, but did you already use it
today?

1724
01:51:39,935 --> 01:51:41,560
SAM: No, I used it yesterday.

1725
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:45,565
MATT: Correct, you would still have the ability to
use it today.

1726
01:51:45,565 --> 01:51:51,266
TALIESIN: All right. I think we've done an
enormous amount towards getting prepared for this.

1727
01:51:51,266 --> 01:51:56,821
LAURA: Does everything over there fight with
fire?

1728
01:51:56,821 --> 01:52:04,066
MATT: "Not everything. But many things there have
fire by nature. Or at least, the ability to live

1729
01:52:04,066 --> 01:52:10,928
"among it. There are many parts of the Fire Plane
that you should not traverse. It would destroy you

1730
01:52:10,928 --> 01:52:12,378
"immediately."

1731
01:52:12,378 --> 01:52:21,026
LAURA: The City of Brass sucks, but we'll be okay
going there, ish?

1732
01:52:21,026 --> 01:52:23,681
MATT: "It's one of the few places that can support
a city, so yes."

1733
01:52:23,681 --> 01:52:25,091
LIAM: Kind of hot?

1734
01:52:25,091 --> 01:52:36,272
MATT: "It is very hot there. The longer you stay,
the more difficult it is for such frail beings as

1735
01:52:36,272 --> 01:52:37,674
"us to exist."

1736
01:52:37,674 --> 01:52:38,967
TRAVIS: Speak for yourself.

1737
01:52:38,967 --> 01:52:40,262
LAURA: In and out.

1738
01:52:40,262 --> 01:52:48,622
TRAVIS: Pull the trigger, travel agent.

1739
01:52:48,622 --> 01:52:50,459
MARISHA: Let's do this shit.

1740
01:52:50,459 --> 01:52:54,978
MATT: "Stay safe. I will see you soon at this Fort
Daxio."

1741
01:52:54,978 --> 01:52:56,764
LAURA: Thank you so much.

1742
01:52:56,764 --> 01:52:58,830
SAM: This was a worthwhile trip already.

1743
01:52:58,830 --> 01:53:01,070
LIAM: I'm setting my armor to fire resistance.

1744
01:53:01,070 --> 01:53:07,344
ASHLEY: Is there anything else we need to know, to
be safe, to look out for while we're there?

1745
01:53:07,344 --> 01:53:17,187
MATT: "Nothing which you haven't already seen.
Just know there are many denizens there that enjoy

1746
01:53:17,187 --> 01:53:22,629
"the tyranny, so be careful. Don't start any
wars."

1747
01:53:22,629 --> 01:53:31,456
LAURA: Can I say while this whole talk's been going on,
that I've been unattuning my coldsnap armor and

1748
01:53:31,456 --> 01:53:33,682
reattuning my bracers of archery?

1749
01:53:33,682 --> 01:53:37,895
MATT: Sure. It will take you guys a short rest to
do all that. Plus, with your reattune there. You

1750
01:53:37,895 --> 01:53:46,953
guys take a short rest while Cerkonos takes a
couple of the other nearby Pyrah with him and they

1751
01:53:46,953 --> 01:53:51,008
head off towards the Cinder Grove. Presumably, to
communicate with your father.

1752
01:53:51,008 --> 01:53:52,148
MARISHA: Cool.

1753
01:53:52,148 --> 01:53:53,161
LAURA: Can I ask you a question?

1754
01:53:53,161 --> 01:53:54,190
MATT: Yes.

1755
01:53:54,190 --> 01:54:00,739
LAURA: If I have two bows that are awesome, and
I'm attuned to both of them, how easy is it to

1756
01:54:00,739 --> 01:54:02,069
switch in a battle?

1757
01:54:02,069 --> 01:54:04,053
MATT: If you have two bows that are attuned to
you?

1758
01:54:04,053 --> 01:54:10,255
LAURA: Yeah. If I chose to attune to the Sky
Sentinel and Fenthras instead of the bracers?

1759
01:54:10,255 --> 01:54:17,868
MATT: I mean, it's possible. But the idea of
having one wielded and one on your back, pulling

1760
01:54:17,868 --> 01:54:20,461
it out. You're not proficient and fast in
bow-drawing.

1761
01:54:20,461 --> 01:54:25,854
LAURA: It'd be an action to switch them out in a
battle?

1762
01:54:25,854 --> 01:54:32,370
MATT: Maybe. Probably. You could drop one, but
then pulling the other one out, getting it around

1763
01:54:32,370 --> 01:54:35,912
you, arrow out. It would probably take you an
action.

1764
01:54:35,912 --> 01:54:40,161
LAURA: Cool.

1765
01:54:40,161 --> 01:54:42,546
SAM: Let's just go, man.

1766
01:54:42,546 --> 01:54:45,247
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm standing there with my eyes
closed and my hands out.

1767
01:54:45,247 --> 01:54:49,971
LAURA: Hey! That all happened in a millisecond. I
was considering things in my brain.

1768
01:54:49,971 --> 01:54:51,943
TRAVIS: I'm showing my willingness to go.

1769
01:54:51,943 --> 01:54:57,952
MARISHA: Let's go. City of Brass, yo.

1770
01:54:57,952 --> 01:55:07,063
MATT: All right. So focusing on the City of Brass.
You all gather hands. As Keyleth concentrates, you

1771
01:55:07,063 --> 01:55:16,260
feel the already warm air of the cauldron of this
volcanic mountain. You feel a blast of heat

1772
01:55:16,260 --> 01:55:23,901
surround you, this whirlwind of hot air that
causes your eyes to close instinctually. You feel

1773
01:55:23,901 --> 01:55:31,076
the edges of your skin, the hairs begin to curl.
Your brows begin to singe. As you close your eyes

1774
01:55:31,076 --> 01:55:40,733
instinctually, you open them again. And looking
around you see a familiar broken landscape of

1775
01:55:40,733 --> 01:55:47,345
shattered stone rock, reddish and iron-like in
coloration. You see various stone obelisks that

1776
01:55:47,345 --> 01:55:55,866
are jutting out of the ground from broken and at
some points seismic earth that had been pushed up

1777
01:55:55,866 --> 01:56:01,412
from underneath where gouts of flame occasionally
spill out and burst into the sky. The air itself

1778
01:56:01,412 --> 01:56:11,531
carries a sulfuric and ionized scent to it. You
can see darkened clouds of smoke and soot that

1779
01:56:11,531 --> 01:56:19,971
slowly shift in the distance. Way off towards the
horizon, almost the equivalent of a darkened storm

1780
01:56:19,971 --> 01:56:25,616
in the distance, except it's a sheet of roaring
fire. Just taking up an entire quarter of the

1781
01:56:25,616 --> 01:56:32,233
skyline, miles and miles away from you. You don't
know if it's coming closer or further away, but

1782
01:56:32,233 --> 01:56:37,832
it's frightening. As you glance over your
shoulder, you see behind you a glimmer of whatever

1783
01:56:37,832 --> 01:56:47,060
source of light this land takes into itself
reflecting off of dozens upon dozens of reflective

1784
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:54,888
metallic buildings and towers and domes. And one
large, dark metal wall that surrounds the

1785
01:56:54,888 --> 01:57:02,461
exterior. You see upon this, what you assume to be
the City of Brass. And that's where we're going to

1786
01:57:02,461 --> 01:57:03,753
go ahead and take a break.

1787
01:57:03,753 --> 01:57:05,321
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Shit.

1788
01:57:05,321 --> 01:57:06,927
MATT: Be right back here in a few minutes!

1789
01:57:06,927 --> 01:57:09,818
LAURA: Oh, right! With the announcement of our
winners!

1790
01:57:09,818 --> 01:57:13,964
MATT: It might be a little bit of a longer break,
we'll be back here shortly, guys. Be patient, see

1791
01:57:13,964 --> 01:57:15,225
you in a minute.

1792
01:57:15,225 --> 02:19:59,003
[break]

1793
02:19:59,003 --> 02:20:04,411
MATT: Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Before
we get into the game, we're going to go ahead and

1794
02:20:04,411 --> 02:20:07,976
announce our winners for the Critical Costumes
contest we ran!

1795
02:20:07,976 --> 02:20:10,423
(cheering)

1796
02:20:10,423 --> 02:20:15,289
MATT: Once again, <i>every</i> costume put out there
was fantastic. Seriously, you guys, it was one of

1797
02:20:15,289 --> 02:20:20,475
the coolest things to see, a bunch of characters
in our silly little D&amp;D game realized, physically,

1798
02:20:20,475 --> 02:20:23,978
by other people is crazy.

1799
02:20:23,978 --> 02:20:28,921
LIAM: It's also, I amass everything and I couldn't
get in all the awesome, even into what we put into

1800
02:20:28,921 --> 02:20:33,915
the slideshow in the episode and in the gallery on
Geek &amp; Sundry today. There were so many good

1801
02:20:33,915 --> 02:20:37,098
costumes and we're blown away by-- I mean, it was
a massive amount.

1802
02:20:37,098 --> 02:20:42,951
MARISHA: A lot came in at the eleventh hour, too,
so if you didn't see yours in the slideshow-- we

1803
02:20:42,951 --> 02:20:45,271
still probably saw, but that would be why.

1804
02:20:45,271 --> 02:20:46,770
LAURA: Yeah, because we've been looking at the
hashtag like crazy.

1805
02:20:46,770 --> 02:20:49,540
MATT: Which, by the way, if you haven't looked
yet, go look at the hashtag CriticalCostumes and

1806
02:20:49,540 --> 02:20:57,176
marvel at how many awesome, talented people out
there made crazy Halloween costumes. So do it.

1807
02:20:57,176 --> 02:21:01,987
We're going to go ahead and begin with our
personal choices, across the bay. You want to

1808
02:21:01,987 --> 02:21:03,030
start over here?

1809
02:21:03,030 --> 02:21:09,458
TRAVIS: Sure! I chose @couple_cosplay for his
white, muscular version of Grog. Grog got abs, y'all.

1810
02:21:09,458 --> 02:21:13,327
(cheering)

1811
02:21:13,327 --> 02:21:23,333
ASHLEY: I chose the most lovely and wonderful
@KinnVelier. Her picture of Pike had the perfect

1812
02:21:23,333 --> 02:21:31,322
pose, the most wonderful costume, everything was
there. Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

1813
02:21:31,322 --> 02:21:40,853
LAURA: My personal choice was @sara-rokhov! I
don't know if I said that right, but she did the

1814
02:21:40,853 --> 02:21:45,979
costume that was closest to the outfit that we
wore in the opening credits, which is <i>really</i>

1815
02:21:45,979 --> 02:21:50,723
cool because I know that's really intricate, and I
saw the sleeves. There was crazy pleated sleeves

1816
02:21:50,723 --> 02:21:52,245
happening on that costume!

1817
02:21:52,245 --> 02:21:53,577
MARISHA: Yeah, she got, like, real close.

1818
02:21:53,577 --> 02:21:54,831
LAURA: It was awesome!

1819
02:21:54,831 --> 02:22:01,880
LIAM: I'm going to cheat. I'm giving mine to
@missbelletrist and @miss_riahne for doing Vex and

1820
02:22:01,880 --> 02:22:07,719
Vax throwing money around and flipping daggers and
climbing trees. Great photos, great costumes,

1821
02:22:07,719 --> 02:22:09,139
great attitude.

1822
02:22:09,139 --> 02:22:10,549
LAURA and ASHLEY: Yeah.

1823
02:22:10,549 --> 02:22:18,752
MARISHA: I'm going to go with Woodson Schindler
AKA @CriticalCorrupt for his Manleth. He did a

1824
02:22:18,752 --> 02:22:19,971
bearded Keyleth.

1825
02:22:19,971 --> 02:22:21,476
ASHLEY: What?!

1826
02:22:21,476 --> 02:22:28,812
MARISHA: Oh yeah, it was legit. And his eyeshadow
was on point. I just want to say. So

1827
02:22:28,812 --> 02:22:31,527
@CriticalCorrupt, you're awesome.

1828
02:22:31,527 --> 02:22:43,432
TALIESIN: Wow, okay! I'm going to go with Karin
Rindevall, @karrey over in Gothenburg, for the

1829
02:22:43,432 --> 02:22:48,751
amazing Percy being very, very busy and at work
and reading.

1830
02:22:48,751 --> 02:22:49,735
LAURA: Upper crust?

1831
02:22:49,735 --> 02:22:53,191
TALIESIN: And very upper crust. Very fancy. The
fanciest. So fancy.

1832
02:22:53,191 --> 02:23:03,670
SAM: My choice was an obvious one. It's
@cat_cosplay for the cat version of Scanlan, or as

1833
02:23:03,670 --> 02:23:13,399
I call him, CAT Scan. And for those asking, we're
not putting up these pictures right now because we

1834
02:23:13,399 --> 02:23:20,403
literally just picked them one minute ago, but
we'll be retweeting our current, our personal

1835
02:23:20,403 --> 02:23:26,677
picks of the evening. So you can watch our
twitters, or maybe @CriticalRole can tweet them

1836
02:23:26,677 --> 02:23:28,015
out or something? Okay.

1837
02:23:28,015 --> 02:23:38,235
MATT: Yeah, well done. My personal choice is
@jettiebettie who did an amazing Ripley. Not just

1838
02:23:38,235 --> 02:23:44,275
costume and presentation, but the intensity of
expression, the personality. It was a fantastic

1839
02:23:44,275 --> 02:23:48,732
capturing of the character and the minute I saw it
I was like, oh, there she is.

1840
02:23:48,732 --> 02:23:50,553
LIAM: Straight out of Central Casting.

1841
02:23:50,553 --> 02:23:55,099
MATT: Yeah, it was amazing. Awesome job.

1842
02:23:55,099 --> 02:24:00,580
LIAM: So those are our personal picks and we also
all picked a third place, a second place, and a

1843
02:24:00,580 --> 02:24:01,647
first place.

1844
02:24:01,647 --> 02:24:02,993
MARISHA: Overall winners.

1845
02:24:02,993 --> 02:24:10,761
LIAM: (dramatic voice) Overall winners. Here they
are. Number three: (normally) @kwwins, who is also

1846
02:24:10,761 --> 02:24:17,216
an artist for us all the time, was chosen for
number three for her Minxie/Keyleth transformation pic.

1847
02:24:17,216 --> 02:24:19,677
LAURA: That was so cool! Good concept.

1848
02:24:19,677 --> 02:24:23,181
MARISHA: That was so well done.

1849
02:24:23,181 --> 02:24:30,647
LIAM: Number two goes to @norfrosch who did the
amazing Victor with crazy eyebrows.

1850
02:24:30,647 --> 02:24:32,558
LAURA: So good!

1851
02:24:32,558 --> 02:24:36,926
MATT: Yeah, it takes a lot to shame my Victor. Not
really, I threw mine together. And then that one,

1852
02:24:36,926 --> 02:24:43,598
the day after, I saw that picture and went, "Well,
damn. I lose." It was amazing!

1853
02:24:43,598 --> 02:24:45,935
MARISHA: He was like, "Oh, she did way better than
I did."

1854
02:24:45,935 --> 02:24:48,096
MATT: It was amazing.

1855
02:24:48,096 --> 02:24:50,163
LIAM: And in first place--

1856
02:24:50,163 --> 02:24:55,614
MARISHA: We have to go to a commercial break! Stay
tuned.

1857
02:24:55,614 --> 02:24:56,780
MATT: No.

1858
02:24:56,780 --> 02:24:57,879
LIAM: Loot Crate!

1859
02:24:57,879 --> 02:25:01,466
LAURA: Close up on all of us looking at each other
like, who's it going to be?

1860
02:25:01,466 --> 02:25:02,921
MATT: Oh, god.

1861
02:25:02,921 --> 02:25:09,030
LIAM: Yeah, so for an amazing Percy in bird mask,
both an amazing photo, amazing costume--

1862
02:25:09,030 --> 02:25:10,393
LAURA: Amazing weapon.

1863
02:25:10,393 --> 02:25:13,988
LIAM: Amazing weapon, @calahammer is our first
place winner.

1864
02:25:13,988 --> 02:25:16,236
(cheering)

1865
02:25:16,236 --> 02:25:18,793
ASHLEY: That one took my breath away a little bit.
Rad.

1866
02:25:18,793 --> 02:25:21,080
TRAVIS: (singing) Take my breath away...

1867
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:25,991
(a capella version of Take My Breath Away)

1868
02:25:25,991 --> 02:25:29,804
MATT: And a gathered round of applause for <i>all</i>
those amazing costumes. Everyone did an incredible

1869
02:25:29,804 --> 02:25:32,070
job. Seriously.

1870
02:25:32,070 --> 02:25:40,523
LAURA: And just so you know, all of you winners,
@CriticalRole on twitter will follow you so you

1871
02:25:40,523 --> 02:25:44,392
can DM your mailing address and get your wonderful
prizes.

1872
02:25:44,392 --> 02:25:50,842
SAM: Some of the prizes include shirts that I've
worn on the stream, some of which I have

1873
02:25:50,842 --> 02:25:52,306
laundered.

1874
02:25:52,306 --> 02:25:57,594
LAURA: Oh, god. Some prizes may include part of my
dice hoard.

1875
02:25:57,594 --> 02:26:05,321
TALIESIN: We're going to send a weird little
Halloween cornucopia of weird. It'll be great.

1876
02:26:05,321 --> 02:26:07,787
MARISHA: We're going to raid our closets. Hook you
guys up.

1877
02:26:07,787 --> 02:26:09,478
TRAVIS: Hook it up!

1878
02:26:09,478 --> 02:26:11,411
SAM: All right.

1879
02:26:11,411 --> 02:26:12,649
MATT: All righty.

1880
02:26:12,649 --> 02:26:17,483
LAURA: Oh no, oh no, oh no! Okay, City of Brass,
City of Brass, here we go.

1881
02:26:17,483 --> 02:26:21,394
TALIESIN: (singing) City of Brass! City of
Brass--

1882
02:26:21,394 --> 02:26:23,042
TRAVIS: Nobody's with you.

1883
02:26:23,042 --> 02:26:24,763
SAM: (singing) City of Brass!

1884
02:26:24,763 --> 02:26:26,543
TALIESIN: Thank you! Just one Doors fan.

1885
02:26:26,543 --> 02:26:36,484
MATT: As you guys take in the intensity of the
atmosphere, looking up at the one blaring, bright

1886
02:26:36,484 --> 02:26:45,807
sun in the sky, locked in that reddish-orange
atmosphere above you, you look around as the wind

1887
02:26:45,807 --> 02:26:53,901
picks up, the heat carrying ash and black soot
through, forcing you to wince and keep your eyes

1888
02:26:53,901 --> 02:26:58,600
somewhat closed. You immediately begin to pull
scarves up in front to try and filter this

1889
02:26:58,600 --> 02:27:02,822
aggressive and caustic air.

1890
02:27:02,822 --> 02:27:07,792
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and cast Protection
from Energy on myself with fire.

1891
02:27:07,792 --> 02:27:10,341
SAM: Good for you.

1892
02:27:10,341 --> 02:27:16,581
LAURA: Yeah, right? It's a concentration spell, or
else I would've taken it too. You can't do it with

1893
02:27:16,581 --> 02:27:18,018
anything else.

1894
02:27:18,018 --> 02:27:23,775
MATT: Looking as to where that giant wall of fire
across the horizon is, you see it begin to merge

1895
02:27:23,775 --> 02:27:32,310
closer and closer, the edge of that sea, until
eventually it comes to the City of Brass, which

1896
02:27:32,310 --> 02:27:40,699
you see behind you-- this large, amazing, vast
city of various reflective, metallic surfaces. You

1897
02:27:40,699 --> 02:27:46,734
see pointed spires, round domes, and hundreds and
hundreds of these buildings that sprawl out beyond

1898
02:27:46,734 --> 02:27:53,480
the wall that you see on the outside of it. What
would you guys like to do?

1899
02:27:53,480 --> 02:27:59,143
TRAVIS: Before we go any farther, if we want to
pull the ripcord, what does that look like?

1900
02:27:59,143 --> 02:28:01,323
SAM: What do you mean, if we want to go back?

1901
02:28:01,323 --> 02:28:02,645
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1902
02:28:02,645 --> 02:28:06,335
MARISHA: We have to, I think, be in a fairly safe
space and give me a minute?

1903
02:28:06,335 --> 02:28:07,510
TRAVIS: One minute.

1904
02:28:07,510 --> 02:28:11,216
MARISHA: Let me double check before I say that.

1905
02:28:11,216 --> 02:28:14,865
SAM: Are we already backing out of this, Grog?

1906
02:28:14,865 --> 02:28:18,211
TRAVIS: No, I'm making sure that we're not like,
"Oh, we've got to go! Oh shit!"

1907
02:28:18,211 --> 02:28:19,989
MARISHA: Nope, I lied. It's instantaneous.

1908
02:28:19,989 --> 02:28:22,006
TRAVIS: But we all got to be touching?

1909
02:28:22,006 --> 02:28:25,708
MARISHA: Me and up to eight willing creatures who
link hands in a circle.

1910
02:28:25,708 --> 02:28:27,320
LAURA, ASHLEY, and TRAVIS: Okay.

1911
02:28:27,320 --> 02:28:29,484
LAURA: What's our Jenga?

1912
02:28:29,484 --> 02:28:31,557
MARISHA: Yeah, what's our code word?

1913
02:28:31,557 --> 02:28:32,960
SAM: Super Jenga!

1914
02:28:32,960 --> 02:28:36,301
LAURA: "Super Jenga" means everybody run towards
each other and link hands.

1915
02:28:36,301 --> 02:28:46,761
LIAM: So "Jenga" means "I fucked up, my name is
Vax." And "Super Jenga" means we have to link hands

1916
02:28:46,761 --> 02:28:48,345
and bounce.

1917
02:28:48,345 --> 02:28:50,237
TRAVIS: "Duck, duck, goose" means it's playtime.

1918
02:28:50,237 --> 02:28:51,270
LAURA: Yeah.

1919
02:28:51,270 --> 02:28:53,505
SAM: Let's walk into the City of Brass.

1920
02:28:53,505 --> 02:28:54,418
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1921
02:28:54,418 --> 02:29:01,678
MATT: All right. As you guys begin stepping
towards this, and it is hard to gauge distance on

1922
02:29:01,678 --> 02:29:08,506
this city's size, even from just arriving in this
place.The more you walk, the slower its arrival

1923
02:29:08,506 --> 02:29:18,539
comes as you begin to take in the sheer immensity
of its sprawling expanse. You see little

1924
02:29:18,539 --> 02:29:26,318
occasional bursts of flame off from the opposite
side of the wall, some small shapes coasting over,

1925
02:29:26,318 --> 02:29:33,608
a little glow pass. And as you get close enough,
I'm going to have everyone roll a perception check.

1926
02:29:33,608 --> 02:29:37,370
TRAVIS: I got this, you guys.

1927
02:29:37,370 --> 02:29:40,758
LAURA: 27.

1928
02:29:40,758 --> 02:29:41,872
MARISHA: 25.

1929
02:29:41,872 --> 02:29:43,174
TALIESIN: 15.

1930
02:29:43,174 --> 02:29:44,317
LIAM: 27.

1931
02:29:44,317 --> 02:29:45,979
TRAVIS: 12.

1932
02:29:45,979 --> 02:29:47,463
SAM: Bullshit over here.

1933
02:29:47,463 --> 02:29:48,467
ASHLEY: 21!

1934
02:29:48,467 --> 02:29:49,434
TRAVIS: 12.

1935
02:29:49,434 --> 02:29:54,625
MATT: Okay. Keyleth, what did you get?

1936
02:29:54,625 --> 02:29:55,756
MARISHA: 25.

1937
02:29:55,756 --> 02:29:56,901
MATT: 25, and you got--?

1938
02:29:56,901 --> 02:29:58,249
TALIESIN: 15.

1939
02:29:58,249 --> 02:30:01,841
MATT: All right, so Keyleth and the twins. You
guys, looking ahead, you're beginning to see these

1940
02:30:01,841 --> 02:30:09,883
darkish shapes moving towards the edge of one of
the first gates that you notice amongst the

1941
02:30:09,883 --> 02:30:16,666
reflective surface of the outer wall. It is a
solid door, like two large doors that are affixed

1942
02:30:16,666 --> 02:30:26,855
to each other with a cross-chain circumstance. You
see six figures currently mounting, shifting, and

1943
02:30:26,855 --> 02:30:31,216
walking along the side of the wall. As you get
closer still you can make out: they look humanoid:

1944
02:30:31,216 --> 02:30:40,011
two arms, two legs. It's hard to make out their
size in respect to where you are, and in paying

1945
02:30:40,011 --> 02:30:46,330
attention as you approach you do notice that some
of them have varying shades of colored skin. They

1946
02:30:46,330 --> 02:30:55,385
wear loose silk outfits: wide, baggy air-filled
pants with long robes or vests that dangle below.

1947
02:30:55,385 --> 02:31:05,154
Muscular. The skin on a few of them appears to be
deep crimson or orangish-red. Two of them, the

1948
02:31:05,154 --> 02:31:11,846
skin actually almost goes to more like a black, a
deep soot and ash color. You begin to see more

1949
02:31:11,846 --> 02:31:17,711
details in the skin. You see horns and large fangs
from underneath. You see large, scimitar-like

1950
02:31:17,711 --> 02:31:23,204
blades to the side. You've seen one of these
creatures before. It emerged from the tear in the

1951
02:31:23,204 --> 02:31:29,298
Fire Plane last time you were there. There are six
efreeti that are currently standing guard outside

1952
02:31:29,298 --> 02:31:30,794
of the gate to the city.

1953
02:31:30,794 --> 02:31:32,172
LIAM: Genies.

1954
02:31:32,172 --> 02:31:34,446
LAURA: Basically. They're really powerful.

1955
02:31:34,446 --> 02:31:35,790
ASHLEY: They're very smart.

1956
02:31:35,790 --> 02:31:37,816
SAM: Think we can talk to them?

1957
02:31:37,816 --> 02:31:39,528
TRAVIS: Yes, let's parlay.

1958
02:31:39,528 --> 02:31:43,338
LAURA: Should we go and talk to them?

1959
02:31:43,338 --> 02:31:45,364
TRAVIS: Only one should talk.

1960
02:31:45,364 --> 02:31:47,706
SAM: Why are you all looking at me?!

1961
02:31:47,706 --> 02:31:50,703
LIAM: Because you have the gift of gab.

1962
02:31:50,703 --> 02:31:54,581
LAURA: You are really good. Go talk to them,
Scanlan. Be super cool.

1963
02:31:54,581 --> 02:31:59,798
SAM: Greetings! Hello! Hi there!

1964
02:31:59,798 --> 02:32:02,289
TRAVIS: Oh shit, you're doing it.

1965
02:32:02,289 --> 02:32:09,775
MATT: As you say this haphazardly from the
distance, you see three of them all of a sudden,

1966
02:32:09,775 --> 02:32:17,324
their attention right over in your direction. Two
of them immediately begin to lift up off the

1967
02:32:17,324 --> 02:32:23,718
ground and their legs vanish into a plume of flame
and smoke as they (whoosh) almost like rockets in

1968
02:32:23,718 --> 02:32:31,252
the sky, heading over in your direction. The other
one goes into a run towards you.

1969
02:32:31,252 --> 02:32:32,366
LAURA: Oh, Jesus!

1970
02:32:32,366 --> 02:32:33,417
SAM: Are they attacking?

1971
02:32:33,417 --> 02:32:34,997
LIAM and MATT: You don't know.

1972
02:32:34,997 --> 02:32:36,656
LAURA: I keep a hand on the bow, just in case.

1973
02:32:36,656 --> 02:32:37,799
MATT: Okay.

1974
02:32:37,799 --> 02:32:40,883
ASHLEY and LAURA: Steady.

1975
02:32:40,883 --> 02:32:47,294
MATT: As you all very nervously sit there and
wait, the two that are cruising through the sky go

1976
02:32:47,294 --> 02:32:51,655
slamming into the ground to the immediate right
and left of Scanlan, not far from you guys,

1977
02:32:51,655 --> 02:32:57,963
leaving these small craters. The flaming smoke,
the lower portion of their body poofs outward,

1978
02:32:57,963 --> 02:33:03,577
scattering ash as you see now their legs, muscular
and thick like trunks of reddish-black muscle.

1979
02:33:03,577 --> 02:33:08,556
They both stand and glance downward at this tiny
little gnome by comparison, each of them standing

1980
02:33:08,556 --> 02:33:12,159
about ten to 12 feet in full height.

1981
02:33:12,159 --> 02:33:13,242
LAURA: Oh, fuck!

1982
02:33:13,242 --> 02:33:14,247
MARISHA: The efreetis?

1983
02:33:14,247 --> 02:33:15,048
MATT: The efreetis.

1984
02:33:15,048 --> 02:33:16,068
LAURA: They're so big.

1985
02:33:16,068 --> 02:33:20,739
MATT: The one that's running eventually catches up
to you and slows his gait and puts his hands

1986
02:33:20,739 --> 02:33:26,747
behind his back, puts his chin up, and begins
walking. You can see now he has these two long

1987
02:33:26,747 --> 02:33:34,026
tufts of black hair that are braided into this
long braid that floats gently as the heated breeze

1988
02:33:34,026 --> 02:33:40,916
continues to blow past you. As he begins to
approach, he looks out among the rest of your

1989
02:33:40,916 --> 02:33:43,831
group and then down at this tiny gnome that has
stepped up to greet them.

1990
02:33:43,831 --> 02:33:47,707
SAM: We request passage into your city.

1991
02:33:47,707 --> 02:33:52,411
MATT: "What is your business?"

1992
02:33:52,411 --> 02:33:57,199
SAM: We are travelling salespeople and we are here
to sell our wares.

1993
02:33:57,199 --> 02:34:02,053
MATT: "What wares are you here to sell?"

1994
02:34:02,053 --> 02:34:09,692
SAM: One item in particular, which could be of
much value to the people in your city.

1995
02:34:09,692 --> 02:34:12,104
MATT: "Then show me this item of value."

1996
02:34:12,104 --> 02:34:13,680
SAM: I don't think you want to see it.

1997
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:15,834
MATT: "Then you don't want to enter the city."

1998
02:34:15,834 --> 02:34:24,983
SAM: All right. It's a pet of ours that we've been
travelling with. It's right back there. And I

1999
02:34:24,983 --> 02:34:27,357
point behind us to an empty space.

2000
02:34:27,357 --> 02:34:32,731
MATT: He glances over towards the empty space.

2001
02:34:32,731 --> 02:34:42,163
SAM: You don't see it? Oh, I forgot. We've made it
invisible. Let me drop the spell. And I will cast

2002
02:34:42,163 --> 02:34:54,356
Major Image, and I am making a goristro, right
behind us, that looks a lot like Yenk because

2003
02:34:54,356 --> 02:34:55,942
that's the only one I've ever seen.

2004
02:34:55,942 --> 02:34:58,625
(laughter)

2005
02:34:58,625 --> 02:35:00,148
TRAVIS: Oh, I love you.

2006
02:35:00,148 --> 02:35:05,201
SAM: 20 feet tall, snarling, growling, just a
fucking nightmare.

2007
02:35:05,201 --> 02:35:12,402
MATT: Okay. So is it just standing there
snarling?

2008
02:35:12,402 --> 02:35:16,218
SAM: Yeah, looking real mean and ornery with spit
coming off of him.

2009
02:35:16,218 --> 02:35:30,217
MATT: Okay. All right. At this point, the three
efreeti are glancing in that direction. First off,

2010
02:35:30,217 --> 02:35:34,629
go ahead and make a deception check.

2011
02:35:34,629 --> 02:35:38,174
LIAM: This is the weirdest day.

2012
02:35:38,174 --> 02:35:40,038
LAURA: Ever.

2013
02:35:40,038 --> 02:35:41,459
SAM: 28.

2014
02:35:41,459 --> 02:35:50,825
MARISHA: You don't think the day when we were cows
was far weirder? That was pretty weird.

2015
02:35:50,825 --> 02:36:00,042
MATT: They glance over. They all very intensely
inspect from a distance this goristro that has now

2016
02:36:00,042 --> 02:36:06,723
appeared, that is snarling approximately how far
away from you? The range is 120 feet in the spell.

2017
02:36:06,723 --> 02:36:08,354
SAM: Let's say 60 feet back.

2018
02:36:08,354 --> 02:36:20,099
MATT: All right. The central one looks to the
efreet to his left, or to the right of you, gives

2019
02:36:20,099 --> 02:36:23,881
him a nudge, and that efreeti-- that efreet begins
to step away.

2020
02:36:23,881 --> 02:36:32,613
SAM: Ah, ah, ah! You don't get to touch our pet.
Please allow us entry to your city and we will find

2021
02:36:32,613 --> 02:36:36,188
someone who can afford to touch him.

2022
02:36:36,188 --> 02:36:46,616
MATT: "Hmm." The efreet that you halted takes a
few more steps, not paying heed as the one that's

2023
02:36:46,616 --> 02:36:56,249
in front of you goes, "So you're looking to sell
this as a servant. This beast will work as a

2024
02:36:56,249 --> 02:36:58,591
"servant, or does it work in servitude?"

2025
02:36:58,591 --> 02:37:05,163
SAM: It works for me, for the moment, and I can
get it to work for someone else for a price. But

2026
02:37:05,163 --> 02:37:10,563
if your man goes over there, he's going to die,
because I will tell my goristro to kill him.

2027
02:37:10,563 --> 02:37:19,447
MATT: "Hmph. It is rare to see something so small
able to control something so vicious and

2028
02:37:19,447 --> 02:37:24,704
"dangerous." And you see him leaning in now, closer
to you. You see these tiny little burning beads of

2029
02:37:24,704 --> 02:37:30,057
red flame as the center of his eyes, against a
black iris. You see, as he gets closer, the grin

2030
02:37:30,057 --> 02:37:35,597
begins to curl across the rows and rows of
sharpened, white, gleaming teeth. He says, "You,

2031
02:37:35,597 --> 02:37:44,908
"such a small, easy-to-crush creature, can seem to
hold dominion over something that exists in places

2032
02:37:44,908 --> 02:37:47,788
"that would rend your mind asunder."

2033
02:37:47,788 --> 02:37:57,018
TALIESIN: I reach into the bag, and I'm going to
grab a little chunk of dragon and a chunk of the

2034
02:37:57,018 --> 02:38:02,349
previous goristro that we still have some bits of,
and drop them in front of him on the ground.

2035
02:38:02,349 --> 02:38:05,313
MATT: (dull thud) (sniff)

2036
02:38:05,313 --> 02:38:08,916
SAM: Those were my other pets.

2037
02:38:08,916 --> 02:38:21,826
MATT: (slurping) (spitting) He throws them to the
ground. He begins speaking in a language that you

2038
02:38:21,826 --> 02:38:30,204
don't understand. It sounds very much like the
slow, rolling fire-bursts of magma pouring down

2039
02:38:30,204 --> 02:38:32,385
the side of a mountain.

2040
02:38:32,385 --> 02:38:34,267
LAURA: What is it?

2041
02:38:34,267 --> 02:38:39,652
MARISHA: Can I recognize it, as a druid who has
spent time as a fire elemental?

2042
02:38:39,652 --> 02:38:43,127
MATT: You recognize the type. It is the same
language spoken by the fire elementals, but you do

2043
02:38:43,127 --> 02:38:49,601
not speak the language. But the efreet that
stepped away has stopped and is taking a moment to

2044
02:38:49,601 --> 02:38:53,146
look from about a 40-foot distance from the
goristro.

2045
02:38:53,146 --> 02:38:56,488
LAURA: (distressed sounds)

2046
02:38:56,488 --> 02:39:09,956
MATT: (loud sniff) And begins walking back toward
the other efreeti. The one before you, whose face

2047
02:39:09,956 --> 02:39:16,724
is still up in front of you, is reading you. His
head is about the size of your entire body. And he goes--

2048
02:39:16,724 --> 02:39:24,948
SAM: I'll put my hands behind my back and stand up
a little taller to meet him.

2049
02:39:24,948 --> 02:39:33,818
MATT: "If you wish to walk the city, then pay the
toll."

2050
02:39:33,818 --> 02:39:37,439
SAM: How much would the toll be?

2051
02:39:37,439 --> 02:39:41,174
MATT: "How much do you think the toll is worth?"

2052
02:39:41,174 --> 02:39:44,329
SAM: Vex?

2053
02:39:44,329 --> 02:39:55,520
MATT: "If the toll is insufficient, and I find
offense at the offer, then you will have bigger

2054
02:39:55,520 --> 02:40:02,950
"problems than entry. But generosity goes a long
way."

2055
02:40:02,950 --> 02:40:11,512
LAURA: So like, money? Is it money, then?

2056
02:40:11,512 --> 02:40:18,093
SAM: The money that we carry with us is from a
far-off land. Will it still be good here? It's

2057
02:40:18,093 --> 02:40:19,938
gold and platinum.

2058
02:40:19,938 --> 02:40:22,935
LAURA: Or would you rather gems?

2059
02:40:22,935 --> 02:40:30,564
MATT: "Gems are good as well. Money is money. We
work and deal with many creatures from many places

2060
02:40:30,564 --> 02:40:34,961
"here. What do you offer?"

2061
02:40:34,961 --> 02:40:43,607
LAURA: Should I just, you know what, fuck it? I'm
going to put the 20-pound bag of gems in his hand.

2062
02:40:43,607 --> 02:40:49,529
MATT: He takes it and closes the fingers of his
hand around it, then shakes it a little and listens.

2063
02:40:49,529 --> 02:40:51,293
SAM: 20 pound?

2064
02:40:51,293 --> 02:41:03,509
MATT: He begins to pour the gems out. He takes a
very keen look at them--

2065
02:41:03,509 --> 02:41:06,914
TRAVIS: Who are you and what have you done with
Vex?

2066
02:41:06,914 --> 02:41:10,999
LAURA: The world is fucking ending, you guys. How
else am I going to use these things?

2067
02:41:10,999 --> 02:41:12,693
SAM: Who <i>are</i> you right now?

2068
02:41:12,693 --> 02:41:20,085
MATT: He pulls the tiny drawstring taut once
again. "May you enjoy your time in the City of

2069
02:41:20,085 --> 02:41:31,867
"Brass. Now, I suggest your wineskins be full." And
he turns around and the efreeti all begin to walk

2070
02:41:31,867 --> 02:41:36,251
away towards the entrance to the city.

2071
02:41:36,251 --> 02:41:44,937
SAM: Loudly and conspicuously I say: Stanley,
invisible! And then he poofs away.

2072
02:41:44,937 --> 02:41:53,192
LAURA: Scanlan, I think you let a little bit of
scry on the ground there.

2073
02:41:53,192 --> 02:41:58,827
SAM: Let's just get in the city and buy me some
new pants.

2074
02:41:58,827 --> 02:42:03,983
TALIESIN: I pick up the dragon scales and put them
back in the bag.

2075
02:42:03,983 --> 02:42:06,027
LIAM: (Stan Lee voice) Greetings, true believers!

2076
02:42:06,027 --> 02:42:10,269
TRAVIS: We pick up the dragon parts and we move
into the city.

2077
02:42:10,269 --> 02:42:12,464
TALIESIN: That was a very good call.

2078
02:42:12,464 --> 02:42:14,482
LAURA: Fuck.

2079
02:42:14,482 --> 02:42:17,137
SAM: I throw up a little.

2080
02:42:17,137 --> 02:42:18,953
ASHLEY: You did really well.

2081
02:42:18,953 --> 02:42:21,074
TALIESIN: Always tip the doorman.

2082
02:42:21,074 --> 02:42:25,195
LIAM: I'm patting Scanlan on the back and wiping
his mouth.

2083
02:42:25,195 --> 02:42:28,801
SAM: Great, now we're inside this stupid city. Now
what do we need to find, a wall?

2084
02:42:28,801 --> 02:42:38,337
MARISHA: No, we have to-- hang on. Let's do a
quick refresher on the impossible needle we have

2085
02:42:38,337 --> 02:42:39,711
to find in this haystack.

2086
02:42:39,711 --> 02:42:41,272
LAURA: Oh, wait! Because I took a spell.

2087
02:42:41,272 --> 02:42:43,984
SAM: A 'Find Item Anywhere' spell?

2088
02:42:43,984 --> 02:42:45,048
LAURA: Locate Object.

2089
02:42:45,048 --> 02:42:46,403
SAM: Holy fucking shit.

2090
02:42:46,403 --> 02:42:50,020
MARISHA: Hang on, hold. I brought that spell as
well.

2091
02:42:50,020 --> 02:42:51,421
LAURA: Oh, okay.

2092
02:42:51,421 --> 02:42:59,400
MARISHA: It has to be within 1000 feet. 1000 feet
isn't a whole lot in this really large metropolis,

2093
02:42:59,400 --> 02:43:00,601
correct?

2094
02:43:00,601 --> 02:43:04,117
TRAVIS: We go to the front door, we do it once, go
to the middle, we do it again. Totally covered.

2095
02:43:04,117 --> 02:43:08,506
SAM: If you guys go 2000 feet apart, that's
essentially a mile spread.

2096
02:43:08,506 --> 02:43:12,269
LAURA: Right? How many miles is the city?

2097
02:43:12,269 --> 02:43:16,779
MATT: You have no idea, you haven't walked inside!
You've got no idea.

2098
02:43:16,779 --> 02:43:19,476
TALIESIN: We are walking towards the door. What do
we know?

2099
02:43:19,476 --> 02:43:23,537
MARISHA: So wait, there's a Beacon of Protection
for the Chosen of Pelor. It is gathering dust on a

2100
02:43:23,537 --> 02:43:30,329
wall somewhere in the City of Brass. It was a
trophy won by a fire giant in a card game from the

2101
02:43:30,329 --> 02:43:32,730
Suutan bloodline that once donned it.

2102
02:43:32,730 --> 02:43:35,401
TRAVIS: Fuck. We got to go find--

2103
02:43:35,401 --> 02:43:39,687
MARISHA: It could be hanging on a pub wall
somewhere, correct.

2104
02:43:39,687 --> 02:43:42,995
TRAVIS: No, it's a trophy. It's too valuable to be
in a pub.

2105
02:43:42,995 --> 02:43:47,141
MARISHA: Do we know where fire giants might hang
out? Or anything about the Suutan bloodline?

2106
02:43:47,141 --> 02:43:48,602
TRAVIS: It's on somebody's wall as a trophy.

2107
02:43:48,602 --> 02:43:50,043
LAURA: Maybe we should ask somebody.

2108
02:43:50,043 --> 02:43:52,687
MARISHA: I mean, it could be in a noble's house,
for all we know.

2109
02:43:52,687 --> 02:43:57,827
LIAM: Do we see anyone who looks remotely like us,
who's not from the Fire Plane, here?

2110
02:43:57,827 --> 02:44:02,224
MATT: Well you're just now approaching the front
gates where the six efreeti currently stand. As

2111
02:44:02,224 --> 02:44:07,234
the three that have returned, the central one
takes his hand up and does this with his finger.

2112
02:44:07,234 --> 02:44:12,840
And as he does, you watch as the criss-cross
chains that hold the gate shut suddenly shift, and

2113
02:44:12,840 --> 02:44:18,074
you watch dust and ash get shaken free from the
chains as they're all suddenly pulled upward

2114
02:44:18,074 --> 02:44:25,685
through these rings to the very top, and the
doors shift open very slowly, giving just enough

2115
02:44:25,685 --> 02:44:32,201
space for people of your physical width to pass
through. Grog, you have to squeeze a little.

2116
02:44:32,201 --> 02:44:39,214
TALIESIN: Good sir, one question before we enter
your city, since you are such a good friend and we

2117
02:44:39,214 --> 02:44:46,742
look forward to possibly being friends again
someday. Where would one find people who enjoy the

2118
02:44:46,742 --> 02:44:52,072
sport of watching large creatures battle? If you
could think of such a thing?

2119
02:44:52,072 --> 02:44:56,681
MATT: (laughs) "Welcome to the City of Brass."

2120
02:44:56,681 --> 02:44:58,620
TALIESIN: I love your answer.

2121
02:44:58,620 --> 02:45:06,678
MATT: As you guys walk in, the doors close behind
and you watch as the chains that were pulled

2122
02:45:06,678 --> 02:45:13,672
free, that now dangle loosely, automatically, on
their own, strike up like snakes, instantly, and

2123
02:45:13,672 --> 02:45:19,006
flash back through on the other side. You can hear
them retying themselves between the ring-loops to

2124
02:45:19,006 --> 02:45:21,247
seal off the doorway once again.

2125
02:45:21,247 --> 02:45:25,338
LIAM: We are in a city where everyone is going to
<i>despise</i> us.

2126
02:45:25,338 --> 02:45:28,172
LAURA: Not necessarily. Act really fucking tough,
dude.

2127
02:45:28,172 --> 02:45:30,073
MARISHA: Yeah, everyone wants to kick our ass.

2128
02:45:30,073 --> 02:45:32,561
TRAVIS: Should we get some jail tattoos before we
continue?

2129
02:45:32,561 --> 02:45:35,374
SCANLAN: I can make us all look really rough and
ragged.

2130
02:45:35,374 --> 02:45:38,695
TALIESIN: I think there's a lot of magic here.
Well, no, let's--

2131
02:45:38,695 --> 02:45:44,634
MATT: So as you say "let's" and it trails off, you
all take a moment to look into the city around

2132
02:45:44,634 --> 02:45:55,560
you. Marquet offered Ank'Harel, a very beautiful
city of ornate culture. This city has been around

2133
02:45:55,560 --> 02:46:02,855
far longer, and has been constructed by far more
intricate artisans since. You see hundreds of

2134
02:46:02,855 --> 02:46:09,083
buildings of different sizes, all constructed from
various types of materials, many of them metallic

2135
02:46:09,083 --> 02:46:13,794
and brass or bronze in color, reflecting the
ever-present sunlight from the sky. You can see

2136
02:46:13,794 --> 02:46:19,058
buildings carved from dark black obsidian. From
other forms of darkened stone you can see natural

2137
02:46:19,058 --> 02:46:24,254
rock formations of blackened rock and stone
jutting outward, where, crafted from that, you can

2138
02:46:24,254 --> 02:46:29,365
see communities of maybe dozens of buildings and
homes that have been constructed from it. You can

2139
02:46:29,365 --> 02:46:35,780
see towers that are impossibly high, hundreds of
feet up in the sky, some broken from previous

2140
02:46:35,780 --> 02:46:43,961
conflicts and never constructed since. You can see
a series of streets that intertwine out before you

2141
02:46:43,961 --> 02:46:51,469
with these tiny little cobblestones that all seem
to have a matching, ruddy, brownish earth tone

2142
02:46:51,469 --> 02:46:58,898
with a dusting of ash and red earth scattered
across them. You see throughout here human beings

2143
02:46:58,898 --> 02:47:08,337
occasionally. You see dozens upon dozens of
efreeti, walking around, crusted with jewelry and

2144
02:47:08,337 --> 02:47:15,245
wearing fine robes and linens. You can begin to
notice quickly that many of these efreeti walk along with

2145
02:47:15,245 --> 02:47:18,269
some of these humans, these humans walk at their
sides, some in chains.

2146
02:47:18,269 --> 02:47:21,358
ALL: Oh, shit.

2147
02:47:21,358 --> 02:47:33,203
MATT: You can see a number of individuals pedaling
small carts through, also in comparable levels of

2148
02:47:33,203 --> 02:47:41,357
enslavement. But not all are enslaved. There are
individuals from other areas you've never

2149
02:47:41,357 --> 02:47:46,838
recognized, various features. You see two
humanoids that walk around by themselves, their

2150
02:47:46,838 --> 02:47:51,170
features are human but not. There's something
about them that's a little off, but you can't

2151
02:47:51,170 --> 02:47:56,262
quite pick up what, and they walk off in the
distance. There is a gathering of many cultures

2152
02:47:56,262 --> 02:48:01,859
that make their way through here, but definitely
the dominant culture here appears to be one ruled

2153
02:48:01,859 --> 02:48:06,277
by the elemental fire djinn that you've already
encountered.

2154
02:48:06,277 --> 02:48:11,044
LIAM: The servants, the humans, and I don't know if
there's any elves, dwarves, halflings, or anything

2155
02:48:11,044 --> 02:48:15,235
in the mix, but people who are not from here, how
does their health appear?

2156
02:48:15,235 --> 02:48:25,810
MATT: Fine, if perpetually uncomfortable in the
current weather, which is, for the record, we're

2157
02:48:25,810 --> 02:48:32,850
hitting somewhere between 110°F to 120°F in the
air at all times here. I'd say, actually, in fact,

2158
02:48:32,850 --> 02:48:36,844
at this time, I'd like everyone to make a
constitution saving throw.

2159
02:48:36,844 --> 02:48:40,511
MARISHA: Do I get advantage because of the fire
resist?

2160
02:48:40,511 --> 02:48:44,856
MATT: You're fine. And actually, you having
fire-resistant armor, I would say you do not have

2161
02:48:44,856 --> 02:48:52,935
to make it, Vax. You feel naturally more
comfortable in here based on the resistance you've

2162
02:48:52,935 --> 02:48:54,372
given your enchantment.

2163
02:48:54,372 --> 02:48:56,268
MARISHA: Do I have to roll? Or am I good to go?

2164
02:48:56,268 --> 02:48:57,509
MATT: No, you're fine.

2165
02:48:57,509 --> 02:49:03,437
TALIESIN: Six! I'm going to use one of my
Resolves.

2166
02:49:03,437 --> 02:49:04,555
MATT: Okay.

2167
02:49:04,555 --> 02:49:10,833
TALIESIN: And slightly better: 15.

2168
02:49:10,833 --> 02:49:12,993
LAURA: 15.

2169
02:49:12,993 --> 02:49:14,505
ASHLEY: Seven?

2170
02:49:14,505 --> 02:49:15,621
TRAVIS: 19.

2171
02:49:15,621 --> 02:49:24,191
MATT: Okay. For the time you've been here, it's
been an unwelcoming atmosphere, but not one that

2172
02:49:24,191 --> 02:49:30,504
has been so harsh as to press down upon your
physical constitution. You all seem to withstand

2173
02:49:30,504 --> 02:49:35,272
the current atmosphere for now, but you do gather
that the longer you are here, the more difficult

2174
02:49:35,272 --> 02:49:41,498
it will be to endure this atmosphere without
detrimental effect.

2175
02:49:41,498 --> 02:49:46,565
MARISHA: I meant to note I wanted to put my Ring
of Protection on and put the cloak away when we

2176
02:49:46,565 --> 02:49:49,004
took that short rest. I don't know if I said that
out loud.

2177
02:49:49,004 --> 02:49:50,381
MATT: You did not say that out loud

2178
02:49:50,381 --> 02:49:51,531
MARISHA: Can I do that now?

2179
02:49:51,531 --> 02:49:52,367
MATT: Sure.

2180
02:49:52,367 --> 02:49:53,345
MARISHA: And it takes some time.

2181
02:49:53,345 --> 02:50:02,174
MATT: It's fine. So what do you wish to do now
that you've gained entry into the City of Brass?

2182
02:50:02,174 --> 02:50:04,719
LAURA: Let's find that armor.

2183
02:50:04,719 --> 02:50:07,106
TRAVIS: Keep walking. Let's keep walking and see
what we see.

2184
02:50:07,106 --> 02:50:11,714
LAURA: Yeah, we walk the fuck forward. Should we
get a little farther into the city or should I

2185
02:50:11,714 --> 02:50:13,614
cast it right now?

2186
02:50:13,614 --> 02:50:15,498
TALIESIN: I think the city's huge.

2187
02:50:15,498 --> 02:50:19,213
MARISHA: Hang on, how long does that spell last?

2188
02:50:19,213 --> 02:50:20,595
TALIESIN: That's the other question.

2189
02:50:20,595 --> 02:50:24,128
MARISHA: Grog, could you recognize fire giants if
you saw one? Are they akin to stone giants?

2190
02:50:24,128 --> 02:50:27,822
TRAVIS: I don't think so. I don't think I've ever
seen one.

2191
02:50:27,822 --> 02:50:33,713
MATT: You have not seen a fire giant in person in
all the time that you've spent on this plane.

2192
02:50:33,713 --> 02:50:38,180
TRAVIS: I bet I can pick it out, though, if
it's giant and it's made of fire.

2193
02:50:38,180 --> 02:50:40,620
MARISHA: And you're like, that's a fire giant. All
right, yeah, totally.

2194
02:50:40,620 --> 02:50:45,474
TALIESIN: Ten minutes-- and the other question is
if you can change into a flying creature.

2195
02:50:45,474 --> 02:50:51,567
LIAM: Are there any humans around right now who
look like they're not slaves? Who look well-off,

2196
02:50:51,567 --> 02:50:52,494
relatively?

2197
02:50:52,494 --> 02:50:54,514
MATT: Right now, you have not encountered any.
You've literally just walked into the city and

2198
02:50:54,514 --> 02:50:57,531
this is your first glance at the first street that
you've encountered. As you guys begin to walk

2199
02:50:57,531 --> 02:51:03,652
farther into the city, one thing that you do
notice, too, is there are these stationary torches

2200
02:51:03,652 --> 02:51:09,696
that meet at various crossroads. And at the top of
these torches there is a ball of flame that is

2201
02:51:09,696 --> 02:51:13,827
flickering and shooting off spurts here and there,
and every now and then you hear one go (flaring)

2202
02:51:13,827 --> 02:51:21,048
in the distance and that's what you were seeing on
the other side of the wall. These flames cause

2203
02:51:21,048 --> 02:51:29,063
this dancing light source effect throughout the
entire city due to the vastly metallic nature of

2204
02:51:29,063 --> 02:51:32,223
the building construct here. And so as you--

2205
02:51:32,223 --> 02:51:34,856
SAM: Sorry.

2206
02:51:34,856 --> 02:51:39,386
LAURA: Oh, wow. That might be the worst shirt
you've ever worn on the show.

2207
02:51:39,386 --> 02:51:40,695
SAM: Yeah, I'm out of shirts, guys.

2208
02:51:40,695 --> 02:51:46,435
74 <i>fucking</i> shirts. How many do I own? 74.

2209
02:51:46,435 --> 02:51:48,335
LIAM and LAURA: Wow.

2210
02:51:48,335 --> 02:51:50,246
LAURA: You'll be shirtless.

2211
02:51:50,246 --> 02:51:52,357
LIAM: I'm bringing you a new shirt for your
birthday, man.

2212
02:51:52,357 --> 02:51:54,165
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: "Okay, I farted. It was me."

2213
02:51:54,165 --> 02:52:01,354
LIAM: Holy moly. Bring it back, people. I'm
specifically looking for a human who is not a

2214
02:52:01,354 --> 02:52:04,690
slave, who looks reasonably well off.

2215
02:52:04,690 --> 02:52:07,065
TALIESIN: I'm looking for social gatherings, pubs,
and otherwise.

2216
02:52:07,065 --> 02:52:11,028
MARISHA: I'm going to talk to Vex as soon as we
get a hot second, whenever that falls.

2217
02:52:11,028 --> 02:52:13,615
MATT: Okay, so as you guys are walking, keeping
your eyes out before yourselves, you guys engage

2218
02:52:13,615 --> 02:52:15,671
in conversation as you continue into the city.

2219
02:52:15,671 --> 02:52:20,133
MARISHA: All right, so we both have the Locate
Object spell. It lasts for ten minutes and we can

2220
02:52:20,133 --> 02:52:25,963
both fly. We could both cast it and maybe do like
a perimeter run, maybe?

2221
02:52:25,963 --> 02:52:27,362
SAM: Wait, how long does it last?

2222
02:52:27,362 --> 02:52:28,997
MARISHA, LAURA, and TALIESIN: Ten minutes.

2223
02:52:28,997 --> 02:52:31,090
SAM: We can get a long fucking way in ten
minutes.

2224
02:52:31,090 --> 02:52:32,765
MARISHA: Yeah, if we're flying.

2225
02:52:32,765 --> 02:52:39,255
LAURA: As long as, you know, nothing attacks us.
Right. That's clutch.

2226
02:52:39,255 --> 02:52:43,874
MARISHA: Well, I could also potentially Polymorph
into something or Beast Shape into something

2227
02:52:43,874 --> 02:52:47,541
that-- Has there been any type of creatures?

2228
02:52:47,541 --> 02:52:48,716
LAURA: Flying creatures here?

2229
02:52:48,716 --> 02:52:49,659
TRAVIS: In the air?

2230
02:52:49,659 --> 02:52:50,707
LAURA: Maybe wyverns or something?

2231
02:52:50,707 --> 02:52:57,151
MATT: You haven't seen any, at the moment. You
have seen, so far, efreeti being capable of

2232
02:52:57,151 --> 02:53:00,939
flight, both from your previous encounter and the
two at the gate that just jettisoned off in your

2233
02:53:00,939 --> 02:53:02,168
direction before landing.

2234
02:53:02,168 --> 02:53:07,246
MARISHA: Okay, are they considered humanoid-ish?
To where I could Alter Self to look like an efreeti?

2235
02:53:07,246 --> 02:53:11,225
LAURA: A teeny, tiny efreeti.

2236
02:53:11,225 --> 02:53:13,357
MARISHA: Teeny, teeny efreeti? No?

2237
02:53:13,357 --> 02:53:20,186
MATT: No. From your Alter Self ability? No. They
are far too different in size, physiology, and

2238
02:53:20,186 --> 02:53:23,872
appearance to pass off as an efreet.

2239
02:53:23,872 --> 02:53:27,612
MARISHA: Are there any humanoids like, like--

2240
02:53:27,612 --> 02:53:29,106
TALIESIN: A fire elemental?

2241
02:53:29,106 --> 02:53:36,487
MARISHA: Or like dragonborn, or like what's the
thing that Zahra is? I'm drawing a blank right now.

2242
02:53:36,487 --> 02:53:37,931
SAM: Wyverns? Lizardpeople?

2243
02:53:37,931 --> 02:53:39,234
LAURA: Tieflings?

2244
02:53:39,234 --> 02:53:41,726
MARISHA: Tieflings, are there like any tieflings
around?

2245
02:53:41,726 --> 02:53:43,554
MATT: You can keep an eye out as you continue
walking forward. You don't see any yet.

2246
02:53:43,554 --> 02:53:47,479
MARISHA: I want to look for the most unsubjugated
humanoids.

2247
02:53:47,479 --> 02:53:52,780
MATT: Okay, so you keep an eye out as you
progress. And you're looking for--?

2248
02:53:52,780 --> 02:53:56,789
LIAM: Anyone who looks like they're not a servant,
who looks like they're maybe getting by well.

2249
02:53:56,789 --> 02:53:58,902
MARISHA: Yeah, kind of the same thing.

2250
02:53:58,902 --> 02:54:07,625
MATT: Okay. Continuing farther into the city. This
whole city has this vibrant life to it, from the

2251
02:54:07,625 --> 02:54:13,107
way it reflects light from the ever-changing,
flickering skylight from the sun, to the flames

2252
02:54:13,107 --> 02:54:22,256
that adorn every single conjunction of roads that
make their way through the city, to occasionally,

2253
02:54:22,256 --> 02:54:32,475
you will see cracks in the ground where a flame
will flare out then retract within. Go ahead and

2254
02:54:32,475 --> 02:54:33,836
make a perception check.

2255
02:54:33,836 --> 02:54:37,206
LAURA: Can we also keep an eye out for anything
flying? I want to see if anything's flying around

2256
02:54:37,206 --> 02:54:38,297
the city at all.

2257
02:54:38,297 --> 02:54:39,157
MATT: Okay.

2258
02:54:39,157 --> 02:54:40,090
LIAM: 22.

2259
02:54:40,090 --> 02:54:49,383
MATT: 22. No more than maybe five minutes into
your walk into the city, you do notice two efreeti

2260
02:54:49,383 --> 02:54:53,788
have begun to follow you from about 20 feet
behind. They're both walking and talking to

2261
02:54:53,788 --> 02:55:03,213
themselves, keeping an eye on you guys. Well,
they're about 25, 30 feet behind. As you continue

2262
02:55:03,213 --> 02:55:09,968
walking forward, you do bring your attention ahead
and at the next street junction, which is more

2263
02:55:09,968 --> 02:55:16,952
like two alleys that collide, you do see two
individuals that walk out. One of them is a

2264
02:55:16,952 --> 02:55:22,768
similar humanoid as to the strange-looking ones
you saw go walking by there. They have a thin

2265
02:55:22,768 --> 02:55:33,145
figure, sallow, elongated features, their hair is
wild and red and stringy and upward behind them.

2266
02:55:33,145 --> 02:55:47,826
Their eyes tend to have a non-human appearance to
them, the iris a light-orangish color. They have

2267
02:55:47,826 --> 02:55:55,017
long white and gold robes and are walking
alongside a tiefling of similar red skin to the

2268
02:55:55,017 --> 02:56:04,857
color of the efreeti here, with deep gray, long
hair that goes behind a ridge of horns that curl

2269
02:56:04,857 --> 02:56:10,420
into almost like ram horns in the front, and the
long, gray hair extends to the mid-back. They both

2270
02:56:10,420 --> 02:56:14,096
walk along side by side, their arms within their
robes-- both are wearing matching white and gold

2271
02:56:14,096 --> 02:56:19,646
robes-- and they each step out from the alley and
begin to walk ahead of you guys about 60, 70 feet.

2272
02:56:19,646 --> 02:56:25,106
LIAM: So it's these two strange beings with
strange eyes and a tiefling.

2273
02:56:25,106 --> 02:56:28,567
MATT: There's one entity that's the strange being
and the other is a tiefling.

2274
02:56:28,567 --> 02:56:34,109
LIAM: Oh, okay. So one is one and one's another,
thank you. I'm going to walk up to the tiefling,

2275
02:56:34,109 --> 02:56:41,635
like ten feet away. Excuse me! Sorry, can I
trouble you for a minute? I've just come to town.

2276
02:56:41,635 --> 02:56:49,067
I know, that sounds ridiculous, it is, I'm a
stranger in a strange land. Could I borrow you

2277
02:56:49,067 --> 02:56:50,693
just for a minute?

2278
02:56:50,693 --> 02:56:52,357
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2279
02:56:52,357 --> 02:56:57,706
SAM: I just got to hell, haven't even unpacked my
bags--

2280
02:56:57,706 --> 02:57:03,578
LAURA: No warning, huh?

2281
02:57:03,578 --> 02:57:05,935
LIAM: That's a 20.

2282
02:57:05,935 --> 02:57:15,608
MATT: 20. They both turn and look towards you with
a curious glance. The strange, alien-looking one

2283
02:57:15,608 --> 02:57:24,897
gives a half-cocked grin and shakes his head. The
tiefling looks you over for a second. "Stranger, I

2284
02:57:24,897 --> 02:57:31,032
"mean you no offense, but--" And as he looks past
you at the rest of the group walking behind you.

2285
02:57:31,032 --> 02:57:34,115
"You know what, follow me."

2286
02:57:34,115 --> 02:57:35,888
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

2287
02:57:35,888 --> 02:57:37,288
TALIESIN: Well, here we go.

2288
02:57:37,288 --> 02:57:40,049
MATT: They both continue to walk in the direction
they're walking.

2289
02:57:40,049 --> 02:57:41,226
LIAM: They're together, right?

2290
02:57:41,226 --> 02:57:45,119
MATT: They're together, but they face away from
you. He's just, "Follow me." And they both

2291
02:57:45,119 --> 02:57:46,629
continue walking ahead of you guys.

2292
02:57:46,629 --> 02:57:51,186
LIAM: All right, so I trip along behind them, and then
I turn around and to the group I go--

2293
02:57:51,186 --> 02:57:53,642
TALIESIN: I'm all right with this. This is a great
way to die.

2294
02:57:53,642 --> 02:57:55,975
SAM: We're following along behind them.

2295
02:57:55,975 --> 02:57:58,665
LAURA, ASHLEY, TRAVIS, and MARISHA: Yes.

2296
02:57:58,665 --> 02:58:03,471
MARISHA: Can I do like an insight check, like size
up this tiefling from a distance and see what they

2297
02:58:03,471 --> 02:58:06,582
might be about, get any idea about what they might
do or be?

2298
02:58:06,582 --> 02:58:12,541
MATT: Go ahead and make an insight check from what
very little bit of body language you can see. It's

2299
02:58:12,541 --> 02:58:14,898
going to be very hard to read anything.

2300
02:58:14,898 --> 02:58:18,531
MARISHA: That's really bad. That's the Gil dice.
15.

2301
02:58:18,531 --> 02:58:25,299
MATT: 15? Unfortunately, at the distance that
he was from you, about 60 feet or so, and what

2302
02:58:25,353 --> 02:58:31,117
little bit time he was faced away-- his interaction
with Vax was so short, it's a blank slate. Nothing

2303
02:58:31,214 --> 02:58:32,387
you can read off of him.

2304
02:58:32,387 --> 02:58:34,160
LAURA: Are they looking and talking to each other
at all?

2305
02:58:34,160 --> 02:58:36,510
MATT: They're not talking to each other, they're
looking, facing away from you, and walking the

2306
02:58:36,510 --> 02:58:45,225
same pace they were. However, Vex, since you were
looking up in the sky, you do see, for a brief

2307
02:58:45,225 --> 02:58:50,659
instant, a large, avian-like entity--

2308
02:58:50,659 --> 02:58:52,347
LAURA: What does "avian" mean?

2309
02:58:52,347 --> 02:58:53,357
MATT: Bird-like.

2310
02:58:53,357 --> 02:58:54,554
LAURA: Oh, got it.

2311
02:58:54,554 --> 02:59:04,777
MATT: --but massive. And it looks to leave some
sort of flame-like trail behind it as it (fiery whooshing).

2312
02:59:04,777 --> 02:59:07,085
LIAM, LAURA, and MARISHA: (whispering) A phoenix!

2313
02:59:07,085 --> 02:59:08,515
ASHLEY: What!

2314
02:59:08,515 --> 02:59:11,616
LAURA: Harry Potter!

2315
02:59:11,616 --> 02:59:16,553
TRAVIS: Fawkes!

2316
02:59:16,553 --> 02:59:18,201
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

2317
02:59:18,201 --> 02:59:26,462
LAURA: Okay! Oh. Intelligence?

2318
02:59:26,462 --> 02:59:27,725
MATT: Yes.

2319
02:59:27,725 --> 02:59:29,000
LAURA: Ew. Eight?

2320
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:30,911
MATT: Eight? Yeah, it's a flaming bird!

2321
02:59:30,911 --> 02:59:32,528
LAURA: That's a fucking bird, y'all!

2322
02:59:32,528 --> 02:59:34,807
MARISHA: So they have birdies.

2323
02:59:34,807 --> 02:59:37,335
SAM: So is it one of those-- what were they
called, Ashley?

2324
02:59:37,335 --> 02:59:38,991
LAURA: Ah! Natural 20 on the--

2325
02:59:38,991 --> 02:59:40,662
ASHLEY: Always.

2326
02:59:40,662 --> 02:59:46,267
MATT: Just don't do that because it doesn't
matter! All you're doing is killing yourself,

2327
02:59:46,267 --> 02:59:47,378
Laura!

2328
02:59:47,378 --> 02:59:48,988
LAURA: Every time.

2329
02:59:48,988 --> 02:59:52,444
MATT: All right, as you guys continue to follow
these two--

2330
02:59:52,444 --> 02:59:54,182
LIAM: Yeah, where are they leading me?

2331
02:59:54,182 --> 02:59:58,703
MATT: Do you guys keep the same distance? Do you
catch up with them, do you stay behind, what are

2332
02:59:58,703 --> 02:59:59,626
you doing?

2333
02:59:59,626 --> 03:00:00,678
SAM: How far back are we?

2334
03:00:00,678 --> 03:00:02,055
MATT: You're about 60 feet behind them.

2335
03:00:02,055 --> 03:00:03,118
SAM: Someone should--

2336
03:00:03,118 --> 03:00:04,442
LAURA: Get a little closer.

2337
03:00:04,442 --> 03:00:07,360
LIAM: I'm going to wave them away a little bit.

2338
03:00:07,360 --> 03:00:12,488
TRAVIS: I think we're cattle. I'm going to lag.
I'm going to drop another 20 feet back from the group.

2339
03:00:12,488 --> 03:00:19,277
MATT: Okay. As you drop back from them, you come
pretty close to the two efreeti that are following

2340
03:00:19,277 --> 03:00:25,486
you from behind, and one of them puts his hand out
and grabs you by the shoulder and pats you and

2341
03:00:25,486 --> 03:00:34,154
goes, "So friend, you are--? You are--?"

2342
03:00:34,154 --> 03:00:36,546
TRAVIS: What?

2343
03:00:36,546 --> 03:00:38,278
MATT: "Who are you?"

2344
03:00:38,278 --> 03:00:39,955
TRAVIS: I can't hear you.

2345
03:00:39,955 --> 03:00:41,405
SAM: Oh no!

2346
03:00:41,405 --> 03:00:43,389
TALIESIN and MARISHA: No.

2347
03:00:43,389 --> 03:00:46,079
MATT: Make a deception check.

2348
03:00:46,079 --> 03:00:51,206
TRAVIS: 17.

2349
03:00:51,206 --> 03:00:57,844
MATT: "Heh. I like this one. We'll keep him." And
he pats you on the shoulder and they both walk--

2350
03:00:57,844 --> 03:01:02,513
TRAVIS: Hey! And I smash the Titanstone Knuckles
together and I cast Enlarge.

2351
03:01:02,513 --> 03:01:09,584
MATT: Okay! You guys hear what sounds like a small
crack of thunder behind you (thunder crack sound).

2352
03:01:09,584 --> 03:01:14,332
As you glance over you can see Grog has swollen to
his enlarged size and is now walking shoulder to

2353
03:01:14,332 --> 03:01:22,997
shoulder with the two efreeti that began to flank
from behind. They both take a step back. "I double

2354
03:01:22,997 --> 03:01:27,839
"down on my statement. We keep him." And they keep
walking shoulder to shoulder to you. They're not

2355
03:01:27,839 --> 03:01:29,678
doing anything, they're walking shoulder to
shoulder.

2356
03:01:29,678 --> 03:01:34,733
MARISHA: I stop and turn around and wait for them
to catch up.

2357
03:01:34,733 --> 03:01:36,583
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2358
03:01:36,583 --> 03:01:40,052
SAM: Oh god. I hang back as well.

2359
03:01:40,052 --> 03:01:44,958
MATT: All right, so you guys, hanging back--

2360
03:01:44,958 --> 03:01:49,277
LAURA: I'm going to try to keep a little closer to
the two in the front and try to see if I can

2361
03:01:49,277 --> 03:01:51,395
overhear their conversation at all if they talk.

2362
03:01:51,395 --> 03:01:55,120
ASHLEY: I'm going to hang back until they come
up.

2363
03:01:55,120 --> 03:01:59,080
TALIESIN: I am not hanging back; I am right in the
middle. I'm trying to, like, be that middle point

2364
03:01:59,080 --> 03:02:00,920
that keeps everything connected.

2365
03:02:00,920 --> 03:02:04,828
LAURA: This is like when your friends start to
drink at the Ren Faire and you're like, should we

2366
03:02:04,828 --> 03:02:07,493
keep going forward, or what do we do, do we wait?

2367
03:02:07,493 --> 03:02:10,451
MARISHA: We'll meet you at the axe-throwing, just
go ahead.

2368
03:02:10,451 --> 03:02:13,647
LIAM, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: To the oubliette!

2369
03:02:13,647 --> 03:02:18,969
LIAM: Just put it all out on the table.

2370
03:02:18,969 --> 03:02:23,246
TRAVIS: So are they keeping pace with me, or are
they standing next to me?

2371
03:02:23,246 --> 03:02:25,764
MATT: They're keeping pace with you as you're
walking. You're walking shoulder to shoulder as

2372
03:02:25,764 --> 03:02:31,195
the rest of you begin to slow down and catch up
except for Vex, Vax, and Percy, who continue

2373
03:02:31,195 --> 03:02:38,524
forward. We have Pike, Keyleth, and Scanlan
beginning to catch up with Grog, and as you guys

2374
03:02:38,524 --> 03:02:45,245
eventually get to the point where you're walking
slow enough that the two efreeti catch up behind

2375
03:02:45,245 --> 03:02:47,769
you, they keep walking with you.

2376
03:02:47,769 --> 03:02:55,917
MARISHA: I light up my flame hand and I turn to
one of the efreeti and I go: Fist bump.

2377
03:02:55,917 --> 03:02:57,788
LAURA: Oh no.

2378
03:02:57,788 --> 03:02:59,726
MARISHA: Pound it, man. Pound it.

2379
03:02:59,726 --> 03:03:08,003
MATT: Make a persuasion check with disadvantage.

2380
03:03:08,003 --> 03:03:11,656
LAURA: Oh, it's at disadvantage. Come on,
Keyleth!

2381
03:03:11,656 --> 03:03:13,994
LIAM: Roll high, come on.

2382
03:03:13,994 --> 03:03:17,659
MARISHA: What did you want? Persuasion?

2383
03:03:17,659 --> 03:03:18,848
MATT: Persuasion.

2384
03:03:18,848 --> 03:03:19,972
MARISHA: Ten.

2385
03:03:19,972 --> 03:03:27,674
MATT: He looks at your fist and flicks it. It does
sting a little. It doesn't do any damage but the

2386
03:03:27,674 --> 03:03:34,090
flame goes out. In fact, it's strange. Normally
the flames would stay, but it's almost like he

2387
03:03:34,090 --> 03:03:36,872
willed the flame in your hand to extinguish.

2388
03:03:36,872 --> 03:03:38,258
LAURA: Oh shit.

2389
03:03:38,258 --> 03:03:42,690
ASHLEY: I have a question for one of you fine
gentlemen.

2390
03:03:42,690 --> 03:03:44,951
SAM: Oh boy, we're all getting in it.

2391
03:03:44,951 --> 03:03:50,667
MATT: The other one on the other side of Grog,
that wasn't interacting with Keyleth, grunts. "Hmph."

2392
03:03:50,667 --> 03:03:52,552
ASHLEY: Do you guys--?

2393
03:03:52,552 --> 03:03:55,036
SAM: (imitating efreeti) We're both women.

2394
03:03:55,100 --> 03:04:07,197
ASHLEY: Oh, I'm so sorry. Anyway. Do either of you
happen to know where the temple of Pelor is?

2395
03:04:07,197 --> 03:04:18,010
MATT: They both slowly look at each other and
grin. And slowly nod their heads.

2396
03:04:18,010 --> 03:04:19,361
ASHLEY: You do!

2397
03:04:19,361 --> 03:04:27,226
MATT: They turn back and one of them goes, "Yes,
we do, actually. Would you like us to take you there?"

2398
03:04:27,226 --> 03:04:31,566
ASHLEY: You can just show us where it is. I
think there's going to be a couple more spots

2399
03:04:31,566 --> 03:04:32,814
we're going to stop.

2400
03:04:32,814 --> 03:04:38,901
MATT: "You seem like you are not from around here.
It is dangerous to wander these streets unaccompanied."

2401
03:04:38,901 --> 03:04:40,639
ASHLEY: Well, I got this guy.

2402
03:04:40,639 --> 03:04:43,829
MATT: "This one?"

2403
03:04:43,829 --> 03:04:45,710
TRAVIS: Yeah! Hi!

2404
03:04:45,710 --> 03:04:49,305
MARISHA: Man, we've been here five minutes.

2405
03:04:49,305 --> 03:04:58,156
MATT: He extends a hand next to you, a very large
hand, and he says, "Come. I will carry you to your destination."

2406
03:04:58,156 --> 03:05:03,630
ASHLEY: I don't like to be carried. I don't like
to be made to feel smaller than I am, thank you.

2407
03:05:03,630 --> 03:05:12,358
MATT: "Then let us continue to walk. We will want
to take a left at the next big juncture." They

2408
03:05:12,358 --> 03:05:20,813
both keep walking alongside the two of you. While
this is happening, you guys are keeping behind and

2409
03:05:20,813 --> 03:05:26,932
glancing over your shoulder and seeing the rest of
your party slowly gather at the knees of these two

2410
03:05:26,932 --> 03:05:29,827
walking, haughty-looking djinn.

2411
03:05:29,827 --> 03:05:34,456
LIAM: (clears throat) Yeah, I was hoping for a
little bit of advice about town. This is starting

2412
03:05:34,456 --> 03:05:41,145
to feel a little kinky. Where are we going? I
don't need to talk that bad. Where are we going?

2413
03:05:41,145 --> 03:05:42,988
MATT: This is to the tiefling?

2414
03:05:42,988 --> 03:05:44,030
LIAM: Yeah.

2415
03:05:44,030 --> 03:05:49,989
MATT: The tiefling looks over his shoulder towards
you and goes, "We are going to-- (groans). All

2416
03:05:49,989 --> 03:06:04,883
"right, this just got very-- If you look ahead, one
alley, we are going to dart to the right. Follow, quickly."

2417
03:06:04,883 --> 03:06:08,632
LIAM: Follow you to talk right now?

2418
03:06:08,632 --> 03:06:09,618
MATT: "Yes!"

2419
03:06:09,618 --> 03:06:11,461
LAURA: Okay. I go.

2420
03:06:11,461 --> 03:06:19,141
MATT: So they begin taking up their pace a little
bit, quickening their walk, almost like a light jog.

2421
03:06:19,141 --> 03:06:20,476
LIAM: Okay.

2422
03:06:20,476 --> 03:06:21,464
MATT: Do you guys keep up?

2423
03:06:21,464 --> 03:06:22,841
LIAM: Yeah. What the fuck are we doing?

2424
03:06:22,841 --> 03:06:24,018
LAURA: I don't know, I don't fucking know!

2425
03:06:24,018 --> 03:06:29,995
MATT: Okay. You guys look ahead and you see the
other three members, the rest of your party,

2426
03:06:29,995 --> 03:06:33,132
beginning to get farther away from you at a faster
pace.

2427
03:06:33,132 --> 03:06:36,011
LAURA: So it's me and you. Are you coming? Are you
still in the middle?

2428
03:06:36,011 --> 03:06:39,244
TALIESIN: I'm keeping pace, but I'm trying to be
at the back end of it. What's happening?

2429
03:06:39,244 --> 03:06:41,564
LIAM: Percy, we're going to go in the alley up
ahead to the right.

2430
03:06:41,564 --> 03:06:42,488
LAURA: Dart to the right.

2431
03:06:42,488 --> 03:06:43,504
TALIESIN: Well, all right.

2432
03:06:43,504 --> 03:06:45,373
MARISHA: I'm going to keep pace with Grog.

2433
03:06:45,373 --> 03:06:47,808
SAM: I'm with them, yeah.

2434
03:06:47,808 --> 03:06:55,341
TRAVIS: (exclaims) Just trying to be even simpler
than I am. Maybe then they won't want me.

2435
03:06:55,341 --> 03:06:59,817
MARISHA: You're probably making it worse.

2436
03:06:59,817 --> 03:07:01,320
TRAVIS: Oh, no.

2437
03:07:01,320 --> 03:07:07,921
MATT: Okay. Following up at pace with them, you
get past a couple of small intersections and the

2438
03:07:07,921 --> 03:07:13,158
two figures dart off into this small alley, right
off to the side.

2439
03:07:13,158 --> 03:07:14,936
LAURA: I go.

2440
03:07:14,936 --> 03:07:16,668
LIAM: I'm going to stealth.

2441
03:07:16,668 --> 03:07:18,973
MATT: Stealth by going into the alley?

2442
03:07:18,973 --> 03:07:21,622
LIAM: Before going into the alley. I mean, I don't
know how dark this is.

2443
03:07:21,622 --> 03:07:22,636
MATT: What are you stealthing behind?

2444
03:07:22,636 --> 03:07:23,830
LIAM: Are we in broad daylight?

2445
03:07:23,830 --> 03:07:29,207
MATT: It's a pretty-- heh. I'm not going to say
it, but the sun is high in the sky.

2446
03:07:29,207 --> 03:07:30,288
LIAM: Yeah. Okay.

2447
03:07:30,288 --> 03:07:32,643
(laughter)

2448
03:07:32,643 --> 03:07:35,438
SAM: (McCree voice) It's full sunlight.

2449
03:07:35,438 --> 03:07:39,124
TALIESIN: (McCree voice) It's lunchtime.

2450
03:07:39,124 --> 03:07:41,683
LIAM: Okay, so no changing in lighting in the
smaller alley.

2451
03:07:41,683 --> 03:07:43,298
MATT: Correct.

2452
03:07:43,298 --> 03:07:44,945
SAM: (McCree voice) It's just turned to PM.

2453
03:07:44,945 --> 03:07:48,954
LAURA: The efreeti behind us, are they paying
attention to us, or are they completely distracted

2454
03:07:48,954 --> 03:07:50,183
by all of the--

2455
03:07:50,183 --> 03:07:53,201
MATT: It's hard to tell. They don't seem to be
paying any mind, and when the two figures darted

2456
03:07:53,201 --> 03:07:54,535
off in the alleyway, there was no--

2457
03:07:54,535 --> 03:07:55,640
LAURA: Anything?

2458
03:07:55,640 --> 03:07:57,747
LIAM: And how far away from the other group are we
at this point?

2459
03:07:57,747 --> 03:07:59,312
MATT: At this point, you're about 80 feet in front
of them.

2460
03:07:59,312 --> 03:08:03,573
LIAM: All right, I stop her and stop at the corner
and look around. Do I even see them if I look

2461
03:08:03,573 --> 03:08:04,838
around the corner?

2462
03:08:04,838 --> 03:08:06,984
MATT: The two figures that darted off?

2463
03:08:06,984 --> 03:08:07,780
LIAM: Yeah.

2464
03:08:07,780 --> 03:08:10,492
MATT: Yeah, they're about 15 feet back and they're
both waiting.

2465
03:08:10,492 --> 03:08:15,454
LIAM: We saw them dart to the right. I don't know
what's in there! I go running in with my eyes

2466
03:08:15,454 --> 03:08:16,771
closed. That's how I do.

2467
03:08:16,771 --> 03:08:18,774
MATT: Okay. Percy, do you follow suit?

2468
03:08:18,774 --> 03:08:20,847
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, I follow suit, yeah. I'm
running in there.

2469
03:08:20,847 --> 03:08:26,037
MATT: Okay. The three of you dart in. You guys
watch as the three of them vanish into that alley.

2470
03:08:26,037 --> 03:08:28,270
MARISHA: Do the efreeti react to them vanishing?

2471
03:08:28,270 --> 03:08:34,695
MATT: No, but that's about two intersections
ahead. The ones immediately before you, the efreet

2472
03:08:34,695 --> 03:08:38,444
goes, "Turn left. To Pelor's temple."

2473
03:08:38,444 --> 03:08:42,041
TALIESIN: For god's sake, you two, tell them that
you have to meet your owner!

2474
03:08:42,041 --> 03:08:45,683
TRAVIS: Oh! Do it. Tell them that we've got to
meet our owner.

2475
03:08:45,683 --> 03:08:51,335
MATT: "Left to Pelor's temple, small one!" As you
guys are coming to the intersection--

2476
03:08:51,335 --> 03:08:53,817
ASHLEY: I'm so sorry, what did you say? Left at
where?

2477
03:08:53,817 --> 03:08:55,162
MATT: "Right here."

2478
03:08:55,162 --> 03:09:06,230
ASHLEY: We're supposed to meet out master at the
temple of Pelor, so--

2479
03:09:06,230 --> 03:09:09,022
MATT: "Then I am taking you. Take a left."

2480
03:09:09,022 --> 03:09:14,534
ASHLEY: I'm going to cast a Zone of Truth and ask
him some questions.

2481
03:09:14,534 --> 03:09:16,587
MATT: Well, hold on a second.

2482
03:09:16,587 --> 03:09:18,340
TALIESIN: Yeah!

2483
03:09:18,340 --> 03:09:20,355
ASHLEY: Is that a bad idea?

2484
03:09:20,355 --> 03:09:22,547
TALIESIN: There are no good ideas anymore.

2485
03:09:22,547 --> 03:09:29,343
MARISHA: It's all bad ideas in Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
It's really true.

2486
03:09:29,343 --> 03:09:32,090
LIAM: Well, what I would have done was--

2487
03:09:32,090 --> 03:09:34,512
MARISHA: Sometimes you get lucky with a bad idea.

2488
03:09:34,512 --> 03:09:38,362
TALIESIN: That's all the game is is getting lucky
with bad ideas.

2489
03:09:38,362 --> 03:09:42,283
SAM: We're Cubs fans walking down Cleveland
Boulevard.

2490
03:09:42,283 --> 03:09:49,200
MATT: Well, as you begin casting your spell--
because casting a spell is a very physical thing--

2491
03:09:49,200 --> 03:09:56,396
you begin to whisper your various divine
incantations beneath your breath, and your holy

2492
03:09:56,396 --> 03:10:01,316
symbol of Sarenrae begins to glow, though
diminished this far from the Prime Material plane,

2493
03:10:01,316 --> 03:10:09,771
still effective. You get partway through your
incantation before the two efreeti who are

2494
03:10:09,771 --> 03:10:16,993
flanking grab Grog by the shoulders and forcefully
push, like a giant wedge, trying to shove your

2495
03:10:16,993 --> 03:10:22,369
entire group to the left down the street. You,
being at the immediate brunt of that, basically

2496
03:10:22,369 --> 03:10:26,462
are getting shoved in the shoulder and off to the
side. I need you to make a constitution saving

2497
03:10:26,462 --> 03:10:28,904
throw to see if you maintain concentration on the
spell.

2498
03:10:28,904 --> 03:10:30,332
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

2499
03:10:30,332 --> 03:10:32,218
MARISHA: You busting out the Hand Cone?

2500
03:10:32,218 --> 03:10:34,633
SAM: I'm busting out the Hand Cone, ready to go.

2501
03:10:34,633 --> 03:10:36,357
ASHLEY: Seven.

2502
03:10:36,357 --> 03:10:42,685
MATT: Okay, yeah, so as you're partway through the
incantation before it gets completely scattered

2503
03:10:42,685 --> 03:10:45,858
halfway through and the spell is lost. You still
used the spell slot, though.

2504
03:10:45,858 --> 03:10:47,154
ASHLEY: Okay.

2505
03:10:47,154 --> 03:10:53,952
MATT: But they're now using Grog as the base point
and all three of them are pushing you all to the

2506
03:10:53,952 --> 03:10:56,056
left forcefully. Scanlan, what are you doing?

2507
03:10:56,056 --> 03:10:58,615
SAM: Are these humanoids?

2508
03:10:58,615 --> 03:11:00,852
MATT: Nope.

2509
03:11:00,852 --> 03:11:10,511
SAM: Okay, I'm going to start singing. I pick one,
the stronger of the two, and I'm going to sing at

2510
03:11:10,511 --> 03:11:12,685
him. Or her, I don't even know.

2511
03:11:12,685 --> 03:11:14,990
MATT: You turn around and sing in their face.

2512
03:11:14,990 --> 03:11:20,042
SAM: Yeah, yep, singing at them. (singing) I make
you want to leave the one you're with, start a new

2513
03:11:20,042 --> 03:11:25,412
relationship with me. That's how it's going to be,
make you go--

2514
03:11:25,412 --> 03:11:28,666
TRAVIS: Usher! Usher from 1999!

2515
03:11:28,666 --> 03:11:31,064
SAM: A little Usher. I'm going to cast Dominate
Monster on it.

2516
03:11:31,064 --> 03:11:33,217
MATT: Oh shit, okay!

2517
03:11:33,217 --> 03:11:37,491
LAURA: Oh god. Do they know they're being
dominated?

2518
03:11:37,491 --> 03:11:41,019
SAM: Of course, but hopefully it'll give us a
getaway.

2519
03:11:41,019 --> 03:11:42,721
MATT: What's the DC on this?

2520
03:11:42,721 --> 03:11:46,980
SAM: Well, it's my spell, right? 21.

2521
03:11:46,980 --> 03:11:49,127
MATT: Jesus Christ, dude.

2522
03:11:49,127 --> 03:11:50,942
TALIESIN: That's the angriest thing I've ever
heard.

2523
03:11:50,942 --> 03:11:57,347
MATT: Fucking Scanlan. Let this be a lesson to all
DMs out there: be careful about creating magical

2524
03:11:57,347 --> 03:11:59,313
items that increase spell DC.

2525
03:11:59,313 --> 03:12:04,689
So that's a wisdom saving throw--

2526
03:12:04,689 --> 03:12:07,164
SAM: You can always break it or something.

2527
03:12:07,164 --> 03:12:15,294
MATT: Let's not break it, but be careful, be
mindful. All right, so, wisdom saving throw. Two

2528
03:12:15,294 --> 03:12:22,298
on that. All righty. The efreet that is on the
left side, the one that is directly behind you--

2529
03:12:22,298 --> 03:12:25,580
the other one that's pushing Pike off to the side
is separate-- the one that's behind you, as you

2530
03:12:25,580 --> 03:12:31,342
turn around and begin singing up to it, it stops
in its tracks and nods its head to the beat as

2531
03:12:31,342 --> 03:12:37,710
you're singing and its eyes half-close for a
second, and you get the assertion that the spell

2532
03:12:37,710 --> 03:12:43,857
has taken effect. The other ally is still pushing
Grog and Pike and basically scooping you guys into

2533
03:12:43,857 --> 03:12:45,588
this alleyway to the left.

2534
03:12:45,588 --> 03:12:52,782
ASHLEY: Can I cast Hold Person on that one? I
think I can do it on a humanoid.

2535
03:12:52,782 --> 03:12:56,066
LIAM, LAURA, and TRAVIS: But he's not a humanoid.

2536
03:12:56,066 --> 03:12:59,940
ASHLEY: He's not humanoid, never mind! That's what
you literally were just talking about.

2537
03:12:59,940 --> 03:13:01,658
SAM: Can I command him?

2538
03:13:01,658 --> 03:13:06,546
MARISHA: All right, am I standing by Scanlan? Are
they in front of us now?

2539
03:13:06,546 --> 03:13:11,036
MATT: No, they're behind you, basically you got
like shoved off at the point. Scanlan turned

2540
03:13:11,036 --> 03:13:17,880
around and did that as Pike's being shoved off to
the side. And Grog, they're both shoulder to

2541
03:13:17,880 --> 03:13:21,601
shoulder shoving you in that direction. So that
was your action.

2542
03:13:21,601 --> 03:13:23,833
SAM: I can't also command him to do anything?

2543
03:13:23,833 --> 03:13:24,898
MATT: Hmm?

2544
03:13:24,898 --> 03:13:26,501
SAM: Can't I command him to do something?

2545
03:13:26,501 --> 03:13:30,240
MATT: You can, I'm getting to that point. All of
this is happening simultaneously. As you're doing

2546
03:13:30,240 --> 03:13:34,996
that, singing in the face of that efreet, you just
got knocked out of your spell, so you're going to

2547
03:13:34,996 --> 03:13:37,014
have to take a moment to do that. Keyleth, Grog,
what are you doing?

2548
03:13:37,014 --> 03:13:41,393
TRAVIS: I'm going to trip and fall flat down onto
the ground.

2549
03:13:41,393 --> 03:13:50,640
MATT: Okay, so you (grunting) and intentionally
fall prone on the ground. All righty. Keyleth,

2550
03:13:50,640 --> 03:13:53,380
what are you doing? If anything.

2551
03:13:53,380 --> 03:14:04,187
MARISHA: Oh, I don't want to do something I'm
really bad at, which is talking to people. I have

2552
03:14:04,187 --> 03:14:16,435
ideas. Okay, is this what I want to do, I'm going
to do Alter Self and I'm going to change myself

2553
03:14:16,435 --> 03:14:18,451
into a tiefling?

2554
03:14:18,451 --> 03:14:19,849
MATT: Okay.

2555
03:14:19,849 --> 03:14:25,560
MARISHA: And then I-- oh god this is really
terrible, oh my god, I am really bad at

2556
03:14:25,560 --> 03:14:32,972
deception-- I'm going to turn around and say, I'm
sorry, there seems to be a miscommunication. These

2557
03:14:32,972 --> 03:14:43,196
are my slaves. They are already owned and my
property. Release them immediately.

2558
03:14:43,196 --> 03:14:48,853
MATT: Okay. So as Scanlan's in the middle of
singing a song, and the one efreet stops in their

2559
03:14:48,853 --> 03:14:53,830
tracks, you turn around and your form shifts. What
do you want your tiefling to look like?

2560
03:14:53,830 --> 03:15:01,251
MARISHA: You know, I don't have a lot to go off of
except for Zahra and that one that was in front of

2561
03:15:01,251 --> 03:15:08,408
us, so I'm going to do Zahra, like a red. You
know, a red, with like devilly horns, definitely

2562
03:15:08,408 --> 03:15:13,346
give it a tail. I want to look intimidating. I
want to look like you wouldn't want to meet me in

2563
03:15:13,346 --> 03:15:14,911
a back alley, but that's where we are.

2564
03:15:14,911 --> 03:15:16,121
ASHLEY: A bad bitch.

2565
03:15:16,121 --> 03:15:17,094
MARISHA: A bad bitch.

2566
03:15:17,094 --> 03:15:18,659
MATT and MARISHA: Bad bitch tiefling.

2567
03:15:18,659 --> 03:15:23,216
MATT: Which is still, like, an eighth as
intimidating as an efreet. But you whip around and

2568
03:15:23,216 --> 03:15:25,549
you say this, I'm going to have you go ahead and
make a deception check.

2569
03:15:25,549 --> 03:15:29,523
LAURA: Come on, Keyleth! You got it.

2570
03:15:29,523 --> 03:15:35,841
MARISHA: It's just a straight roll. Oh, god. Oh
Jesus Christ. Nine.

2571
03:15:35,841 --> 03:15:43,653
MATT: Okay, as you're talking up to the one on the
left, as Grog falls forward, he's looking off down

2572
03:15:43,653 --> 03:15:50,705
and he's going to reach for him as you shout in
his face. (scoffs) And palms you in the face with

2573
03:15:50,705 --> 03:15:57,488
his hand, and I need you to make a strength saving
throw.

2574
03:15:57,488 --> 03:16:10,150
MARISHA: A saving throw. Oh, that was almost so
good, that was almost great! 13.

2575
03:16:10,150 --> 03:16:15,924
MATT: 13. Basically his hand grabs you and, like,
his fingers close around the back of your head,

2576
03:16:15,924 --> 03:16:22,468
holding you like a ball, and lifts you a little
off the ground and throws you into the alley. So

2577
03:16:22,468 --> 03:16:28,710
as Keyleth gets chucked off to the side of the
alley, you're finishing getting pushed off.

2578
03:16:28,710 --> 03:16:31,632
Scanlan, what are you doing with your command over
the efreet?

2579
03:16:31,632 --> 03:16:37,093
SAM: I say to him: Hey sweet baby. Look at me.
It's all going to be okay if you yell at your

2580
03:16:37,093 --> 03:16:38,620
friend to let us go.

2581
03:16:38,620 --> 03:16:48,880
MATT: The efreet that you control turns around and
goes, "Hey! This is not our business. We need to

2582
03:16:48,880 --> 03:16:56,582
"let them go." The other efreet goes, "What are you
talking about? They're at our disposal!" He looks

2583
03:16:56,582 --> 03:17:02,432
back at the first one who goes, "It doesn't
matter. Let them go. Now." The other one looks

2584
03:17:02,432 --> 03:17:18,289
down at you and looks at the other one. That's
cocked. And glances down at you, Scanlan, and

2585
03:17:18,289 --> 03:17:21,489
goes, "What have you done to my friend?"

2586
03:17:21,489 --> 03:17:30,151
SAM: I say to him: I'm just a mere slave and--
kill him! Kill him now! Kill him right now!

2587
03:17:30,151 --> 03:17:33,798
(laughter)

2588
03:17:33,798 --> 03:17:36,683
LAURA and TALIESIN: Oh, no!

2589
03:17:36,683 --> 03:17:38,894
MATT: I need to make a-- actually, for Dominate--

2590
03:17:38,894 --> 03:17:41,498
LAURA: Get up and run, you guys. You better
fucking run away.

2591
03:17:41,498 --> 03:17:43,416
TRAVIS: Is anyone else in this alley?

2592
03:17:43,416 --> 03:17:47,500
MATT: Right now, from what you can see-- You can't
see anything, you're on the ground prone right

2593
03:17:47,500 --> 03:17:53,472
now. You're surrounded by everyone shouting at each
other at this moment. From what you can see,

2594
03:17:53,472 --> 03:17:55,979
nobody else is in this alleyway at the moment.

2595
03:17:55,979 --> 03:18:01,667
LAURA: It's crazy city, people fight all the
time.

2596
03:18:01,667 --> 03:18:04,309
ASHLEY: They're used to this, this is
everyday life.

2597
03:18:04,309 --> 03:18:08,213
LIAM: Yeah, there are fights on every corner.

2598
03:18:08,213 --> 03:18:17,511
MATT: Okay, yeah, so the efreet that you control,
who's still staring at the friend, looks at you as

2599
03:18:17,511 --> 03:18:23,494
you shout this, grins, and grabs the other efreet
by the throat and slams him into the wall.

2600
03:18:23,494 --> 03:18:25,131
MARISHA: Run!

2601
03:18:25,131 --> 03:18:26,885
MATT: You just go running?

2602
03:18:26,885 --> 03:18:29,395
(laughter)

2603
03:18:29,395 --> 03:18:30,591
MATT: Down the alleyway?

2604
03:18:30,591 --> 03:18:31,989
MARISHA: I want to go catch up with them!

2605
03:18:31,989 --> 03:18:36,877
MATT: So as it's holding the other efreet against
the wall, his thumbs pushing into his throat like

2606
03:18:36,877 --> 03:18:41,454
(choking), it's reaching up and grabbing the back
of the hands, its legs flailing as bits of smoke

2607
03:18:41,454 --> 03:18:48,288
and ash being cast off, Keyleth runs past, this
tiefling fucking running as fast as you can down

2608
03:18:48,288 --> 03:18:50,802
the alleyway. What are you guys doing?

2609
03:18:50,802 --> 03:18:54,697
TRAVIS: Can I pop up, grab Pike, and start running
after Keyleth?

2610
03:18:54,697 --> 03:18:58,913
MATT: Yeah, so you grab her by the back of the
armor and lift her up off the ground. Pike, you

2611
03:18:58,913 --> 03:19:03,417
start running, but all of a sudden your feet are
off the ground, you're running in the air, as Grog

2612
03:19:03,417 --> 03:19:04,813
is like bounding with you.

2613
03:19:04,813 --> 03:19:08,911
TRAVIS: And I'm hoping that as we get towards the
door I can shrink back down to go through any

2614
03:19:08,911 --> 03:19:10,875
doorway that they're headed towards.

2615
03:19:10,875 --> 03:19:13,032
LAURA: We're heading towards an alleyway.

2616
03:19:13,032 --> 03:19:14,674
MATT: There's an alleyway, is what you can see,
that Keyleth darts off into.

2617
03:19:14,674 --> 03:19:15,600
TRAVIS: Good deal.

2618
03:19:15,600 --> 03:19:16,579
MATT: Scanlan, what are you doing?

2619
03:19:16,579 --> 03:19:23,342
SAM: I am staying put until my friends are far
away. I'm watching them, watching them, back and forth.

2620
03:19:23,342 --> 03:19:27,384
MATT: Okay, you watch as the one efreet holding
his friend against the wall there is like

2621
03:19:27,384 --> 03:19:31,893
(strained grunt). The one that's being choked
goes, (choking) "What's this?" He reaches down and

2622
03:19:31,893 --> 03:19:36,186
pulls a blade out of the side and begins
jabbing it into the arm of the guy who's holding him.

2623
03:19:36,186 --> 03:19:39,499
ASHLEY and TALIESIN: Run. Run!

2624
03:19:39,499 --> 03:19:45,903
MATT: Which does six damage there, and he gets to
make a saving throw because he took damage. So

2625
03:19:45,903 --> 03:19:52,675
he's like, stabbing him in the arm repeatedly. The
other guy's like (grunting), still pushing into

2626
03:19:52,675 --> 03:19:58,011
his throat, and he takes him, lifts him up, and
slams him into the other wall, causing him to drop

2627
03:19:58,011 --> 03:20:02,665
the dagger in the other hand, and begins to push
him down towards the ground. You can see his eyes,

2628
03:20:02,665 --> 03:20:09,087
still intense, but controlled by the spell as he's
pushing the other efreet into the dark stonework

2629
03:20:09,087 --> 03:20:18,959
and you can see it cracking and breaking against
the force. The other efreet now is being held

2630
03:20:18,959 --> 03:20:23,827
against their-- (foreign language) and begins
chanting something beneath his breath.

2631
03:20:23,827 --> 03:20:25,887
SAM: Oh, shit. They do magic shit?

2632
03:20:25,887 --> 03:20:28,143
TALIESIN: Yes, they do.

2633
03:20:28,143 --> 03:20:29,535
SAM: I thought they were just big and scary.

2634
03:20:29,535 --> 03:20:30,642
TALIESIN: No.

2635
03:20:30,642 --> 03:20:36,412
MATT: So he's currently chanting under his breath
and you watch as the words begin to emit, his form

2636
03:20:36,412 --> 03:20:37,866
begins to shimmer and change.

2637
03:20:37,866 --> 03:20:42,559
SAM: How far have my allies gotten?

2638
03:20:42,559 --> 03:20:50,403
MATT: If you're glancing around the alleyway, at
this point in time, full pace, full round, you see

2639
03:20:50,403 --> 03:20:53,470
Grog and Pike have just now disappeared around the
corner of that alleyway.

2640
03:20:53,470 --> 03:20:55,056
SAM: And Keyleth is gone?

2641
03:20:55,056 --> 03:20:59,229
MATT: Keyleth is gone. She got there before they
did. Actually, you guys would have caught up

2642
03:20:59,229 --> 03:21:01,848
pretty fast because of Grog's speed. So Keyleth
would have gotten a head start and then Grog

2643
03:21:01,848 --> 03:21:05,671
bypassed her, so you just see Keyleth disappear behind
the corner of the alleyway.

2644
03:21:05,671 --> 03:21:09,217
TRAVIS: I'll snag Keyleth, too. I've got them
both.

2645
03:21:09,217 --> 03:21:20,891
SAM: All right. So my work here is done, so I'm
going to tip my beret, good day to you both, and

2646
03:21:20,891 --> 03:21:28,825
I'll Dimension Door into the alley with them or
wherever they went. Actually, I don't know that

2647
03:21:28,825 --> 03:21:33,643
alley, so I'm going to go in that direction the
number of feet I think it is.

2648
03:21:33,643 --> 03:21:40,872
MATT: Okay, so you'll be appearing at the mouth of
that alleyway and you can dart into it. I would

2649
03:21:40,872 --> 03:21:46,320
say go ahead and make a stealth roll to see if the
one who is currently casting even has a glance of

2650
03:21:46,320 --> 03:21:47,877
seeing you out of the corner of his eye.

2651
03:21:47,877 --> 03:21:53,181
SAM: Oh, wow! That's the best roll I've ever done.
21! Stealth!

2652
03:21:53,181 --> 03:22:00,640
MATT: Okay. At the moment as you disappear into
the door, you watch as the efreet that's being

2653
03:22:00,640 --> 03:22:10,075
choked, his form turns into reddish-white gas,
like a cloud of mist, and escapes the grip of his

2654
03:22:10,075 --> 03:22:22,502
friend, who then looks up and-- let's see here.
Okay, yeah, he's going to go ahead and angrily

2655
03:22:22,502 --> 03:22:27,593
look up and his legs turn into that burst of flame
and begin to rise up. And he begins clawing at the

2656
03:22:27,593 --> 03:22:36,015
gaseous cloud as you disappear and vanish, leaving
them both still fighting. You pull into the

2657
03:22:36,015 --> 03:22:39,754
alleyway and you guys are all there for a moment.
You see the rest of them further down the alleyway

2658
03:22:39,754 --> 03:22:43,938
now. You continue following them, I imagine?

2659
03:22:43,938 --> 03:22:44,970
SAM: Yeah.

2660
03:22:44,970 --> 03:22:46,100
LAURA: Do we need to hide?

2661
03:22:46,100 --> 03:22:48,336
MARISHA: Yeah, do these alleyways connect? Does it
block around?

2662
03:22:48,336 --> 03:22:52,135
MATT: The one that you were pushed into,
essentially as you were walking forward, is to the

2663
03:22:52,135 --> 03:22:56,205
left. You guys continued forward past two more
alleyways and then went to the second one to the

2664
03:22:56,205 --> 03:23:01,123
right that way and so this one continues down and
seems to curve around after about 100 feet or so

2665
03:23:01,123 --> 03:23:06,579
through a series of buildings that are built right
next to each other, giving you one pathway that

2666
03:23:06,579 --> 03:23:07,904
curves out of sight.

2667
03:23:07,904 --> 03:23:09,931
LAURA: Let's go as far away out of sight as we
can.

2668
03:23:09,931 --> 03:23:14,759
MATT: Okay, so you guys continue forward down that
alley. You hear in the distance the muffled sounds

2669
03:23:14,759 --> 03:23:24,056
of some sort of weird, echoey scuffle and it seems
to vanish into the rest of the atmospheric sound

2670
03:23:24,056 --> 03:23:34,292
of general wind being blown through tight passages
and the occasional flare of flame. You all turn

2671
03:23:34,292 --> 03:23:39,698
the corner as it begins to curve and suddenly
there's another splinter alleyway that descends

2672
03:23:39,698 --> 03:23:44,577
into stairs and, you guys following the two
humanoid individuals you originally followed,

2673
03:23:44,577 --> 03:23:50,575
continue down that path and they lead you into a
small, enclosed room. There's a door that's

2674
03:23:50,575 --> 03:23:56,450
partially ajar and they've shoved their way into
it and disappear inside. Do you follow?

2675
03:23:56,450 --> 03:24:01,148
LAURA: I think that's the option. Everybody's
running for their lives right now.

2676
03:24:01,148 --> 03:24:08,272
MATT: All right, so you guys all dart into this
same room. As you guys all charge into here--

2677
03:24:08,272 --> 03:24:10,245
SAM: We all die.

2678
03:24:10,245 --> 03:24:20,818
MATT: Yeah, it's filled with spikes and fire. As
you go charging into this room, immediately it's

2679
03:24:20,818 --> 03:24:27,677
much smaller that I think you all anticipated and
it would be Vex and Vax getting there first. You

2680
03:24:27,677 --> 03:24:31,789
guys charge into the room and your darkvision
helps you as you adjust to the change of light,

2681
03:24:31,789 --> 03:24:36,307
just in time for you to run into the two
individuals that had led you in there. This is

2682
03:24:36,307 --> 03:24:44,074
some sort of a storage room, filled with a series of
metallic boxes. And this room could comfortably

2683
03:24:44,074 --> 03:24:49,086
fit five people. And as soon as you charge, you
ram into their shoulder and before you can turn,

2684
03:24:49,086 --> 03:24:55,044
all of a sudden, you watch as Grog with two other
people comes slamming in and you've all very

2685
03:24:55,044 --> 03:24:57,575
tightly squeezed into this dark space.

2686
03:24:57,575 --> 03:24:59,140
LAURA: Sorry.

2687
03:24:59,140 --> 03:25:02,340
ASHLEY: I climb and sit on top of Grog.

2688
03:25:02,340 --> 03:25:04,205
MATT: As Scanlan comes around the corner--

2689
03:25:04,205 --> 03:25:09,522
SAM: Right in behind Grog's butt. Just smooshed on
up.

2690
03:25:09,522 --> 03:25:13,891
MATT: And you do. Sweaty cheek. Reverse motorboat.
It's a terrible thing.

2691
03:25:13,891 --> 03:25:19,682
LIAM: Is it tight enough that the two strangers
are smooshed in as badly as we are?

2692
03:25:19,682 --> 03:25:21,536
MATT: Yeah, they're like, (strained) "Okay--
please-- "

2693
03:25:21,536 --> 03:25:22,742
MARISHA: Is this dark?

2694
03:25:22,742 --> 03:25:24,524
MATT: It's dark. There's no light in here, yeah.

2695
03:25:24,524 --> 03:25:28,580
MARISHA: I lift my hand and I light it up to give
us a little bit of light.

2696
03:25:28,580 --> 03:25:29,789
TRAVIS: Could we close the door?

2697
03:25:29,789 --> 03:25:31,891
TALIESIN: Scanlan, close the door!

2698
03:25:31,891 --> 03:25:33,241
SAM: (muffled) Why are we in here?

2699
03:25:33,241 --> 03:25:34,706
TRAVIS: Are there any windows or anything?

2700
03:25:34,706 --> 03:25:37,115
MATT: No, there's just the door you guys entered.
It's a storage shed.

2701
03:25:37,115 --> 03:25:43,459
LIAM: This is a little more than I think I was
asking for, but what is there to see in the City

2702
03:25:43,459 --> 03:25:45,045
of Brass?

2703
03:25:45,045 --> 03:25:50,009
MATT: You're asking this right now? He looks at
you. "You're asking this right now?"

2704
03:25:50,009 --> 03:25:55,788
LIAM: So we're out of sorts. We're not from here,
obviously.

2705
03:25:55,788 --> 03:25:58,115
LAURA: Hi.

2706
03:25:58,115 --> 03:26:02,248
LIAM: Hi. That's my sister. You can tell because
she looks just like me.

2707
03:26:02,248 --> 03:26:03,939
MARISHA: Aw, Grog.

2708
03:26:03,939 --> 03:26:05,291
TRAVIS: It was Pike!

2709
03:26:05,291 --> 03:26:06,933
ASHLEY: That's not true.

2710
03:26:06,933 --> 03:26:08,724
MARISHA: It's a very small room!

2711
03:26:08,724 --> 03:26:14,331
LIAM: You don't look like many of the larger
folk-- thank you, dear-- that we've seen around

2712
03:26:14,331 --> 03:26:17,467
here either. Are you from here? Are you strangers
here?

2713
03:26:17,467 --> 03:26:19,604
LAURA: How are you not slaves right now?

2714
03:26:19,604 --> 03:26:20,954
LIAM: That.

2715
03:26:20,954 --> 03:26:29,732
MATT: Let me change this to a bit of a calmer
circumstance, here-- the tiefling says, "Shh!"

2716
03:26:29,732 --> 03:26:30,823
LAURA: Sorry.

2717
03:26:30,823 --> 03:26:34,712
MATT: "Shh! Close the door!" And it is like--

2718
03:26:34,712 --> 03:26:38,773
LAURA: Can I climb up on one of the boxes to give
more foot room?

2719
03:26:38,773 --> 03:26:48,842
MATT: As you all inhale, the door finally closes.
Vex climbs up. A minute of quiet passes.

2720
03:26:48,842 --> 03:26:57,336
Eventually, as silence passes for a bit, you hear
a voice, a very soft and gentle voice that you

2721
03:26:57,336 --> 03:27:07,251
haven't heard yet, break the darkness. He goes, "I
think it's safe to speak now." The lithe-looking

2722
03:27:07,251 --> 03:27:19,243
individual you saw earlier with the wiry red hair
and the somewhat reddish-black eyes says, "Well,

2723
03:27:19,243 --> 03:27:32,427
"it was uncommon to see individuals wandering this
city with a look of absolute victimization."

2724
03:27:32,427 --> 03:27:38,465
SAM: (muffled) We don't look that bad, do we?

2725
03:27:38,465 --> 03:27:42,651
LAURA: I pick up Scanlan and put him up on a box.

2726
03:27:42,651 --> 03:27:45,589
LIAM: Those aren't pillows!

2727
03:27:45,589 --> 03:27:49,179
SAM: I don't think Grog wears underpants!

2728
03:27:49,179 --> 03:27:51,226
TRAVIS: Who does?

2729
03:27:51,226 --> 03:28:02,419
MATT: "I'm Senokir. This is Uten, my business
partner. We are jewelers here in the City of

2730
03:28:02,419 --> 03:28:10,092
"Brass. And if I'm not mistaken, you now owe us a
favor."

2731
03:28:10,092 --> 03:28:15,582
LIAM: Maybe we could do a bit of business.
Percival, you were looking for a jeweler, right?

2732
03:28:15,582 --> 03:28:19,484
TALIESIN: Well, it's a little far away at the
moment, but we could do a bit of business because

2733
03:28:19,484 --> 03:28:21,630
we have other business to attend to.

2734
03:28:21,630 --> 03:28:28,607
MARISHA: What caught your attention on us, aside
from the utter look of pathetic-ness?

2735
03:28:28,607 --> 03:28:32,294
MATT: "Favors are more useful when you're not in
chains."

2736
03:28:32,294 --> 03:28:35,085
LAURA: Yes, this is true.

2737
03:28:35,085 --> 03:28:44,523
MATT: "So. Let us wait here about ten, 15 more
moments. Let any immediate chance of you running

2738
03:28:44,523 --> 03:28:52,971
"into those thugs pass. We'll have a more private
conversation at our place of business, if you

2739
03:28:52,971 --> 03:28:54,436
"don't mind."

2740
03:28:54,436 --> 03:28:57,372
LAURA: Why do you wear those white robes? Do they
signify anything?

2741
03:28:57,372 --> 03:28:59,697
MATT: "They signify our freedom."

2742
03:28:59,697 --> 03:29:02,191
MARISHA: Were you once in chains?

2743
03:29:02,191 --> 03:29:13,247
MATT: "Few that come here manage to escape that
fate immediately. We found our way."

2744
03:29:13,247 --> 03:29:19,811
MARISHA: That's ominous. Can I do an insight
check? Does that mean he murdered a lot of

2745
03:29:19,811 --> 03:29:21,076
fricking people?

2746
03:29:21,076 --> 03:29:22,605
MATT: Make an insight check.

2747
03:29:22,605 --> 03:29:33,394
MARISHA: Let's go druid dice. Oh god. Ooh, it's an
18! What was it, insight? Right? 29.

2748
03:29:33,394 --> 03:29:35,493
LAURA: Whoa, you've got really high insight.

2749
03:29:35,493 --> 03:29:37,548
TALIESIN: She know shit.

2750
03:29:37,548 --> 03:29:49,305
SAM: Whispers! Loot Crate, everybody! Loot Crate
is a wonderful sponsor, a fine, handsome company.

2751
03:29:49,305 --> 03:29:50,618
LAURA: Magic!

2752
03:29:50,618 --> 03:29:53,583
SAM: Their theme is magic. You'll get a box of
magic shit.

2753
03:29:53,583 --> 03:29:57,943
TALIESIN: Doctor Strange is part of this one.

2754
03:29:57,943 --> 03:29:59,244
LAURA: And I think Magical Beasts.

2755
03:29:59,244 --> 03:30:03,183
SAM: These are movies that I will never see,
because I have children.

2756
03:30:03,183 --> 03:30:08,669
TALIESIN: In about 15 years, we're going to sit
down and show you everything. It's going to be great.

2757
03:30:08,669 --> 03:30:10,658
MARISHA: Which one was the tiefling, and which one
was him?

2758
03:30:10,658 --> 03:30:15,655
MATT: The one that's been speaking to you is the
other humanoid of strange racial origin.

2759
03:30:15,655 --> 03:30:17,242
MARISHA: Senokir is the humanoid?

2760
03:30:17,242 --> 03:30:18,683
MATT: Yeah, Senokir is the humanoid.

2761
03:30:18,683 --> 03:30:20,634
MARISHA: Who is, something's off about him?

2762
03:30:20,634 --> 03:30:25,549
MATT: Something's different. You don't recognize
his race or background.

2763
03:30:25,549 --> 03:30:37,923
MARISHA: Uten, how long have the two of you been
in business together?

2764
03:30:37,923 --> 03:30:44,181
MATT: "Shh, let us wait. We will continue this
conversation at our establishment."

2765
03:30:44,181 --> 03:30:45,762
LAURA: Is this your room?

2766
03:30:45,762 --> 03:30:46,791
MATT: "No."

2767
03:30:46,791 --> 03:30:47,998
LAURA: Whose room is it?

2768
03:30:47,998 --> 03:30:52,228
MATT: "I have no idea. Which is why we shouldn't
stay long."

2769
03:30:52,228 --> 03:31:00,174
ASHLEY: Do you know where those thugs were trying
to take us? Or have an idea?

2770
03:31:00,174 --> 03:31:04,913
MATT: "I have no idea, but I imagine they would
have called in some friends to meet you and you

2771
03:31:04,913 --> 03:31:08,489
"would have found yourselves in a very tough
position."

2772
03:31:08,489 --> 03:31:12,110
LIAM: All right, it's really starting to smell
like Grog in here, so why don't we go--

2773
03:31:12,110 --> 03:31:15,097
MATT: "A few more moments, please."

2774
03:31:15,097 --> 03:31:20,536
TRAVIS: It was really hard not to fight, man. I do
terrible when I don't fight.

2775
03:31:20,536 --> 03:31:28,270
MATT: "Shh." You wait in awkward silence for the
next five minutes, with any sort of sound,

2776
03:31:28,270 --> 03:31:34,822
utterance, or conversation being immediately
shushed by Senokir. Eventually--

2777
03:31:34,822 --> 03:31:38,140
ASHLEY: (fart sound)

2778
03:31:38,140 --> 03:31:46,995
MATT: --Senokir perks up and the slightly pointed
ears of his form seem to almost twitch. "I think

2779
03:31:46,995 --> 03:31:55,622
"passage is safe. Very well, open the door. Follow
us, please." As you guys filter out, they

2780
03:31:55,622 --> 03:32:02,935
continue, a quick pace, and lead you through a
series of winding side streets and momentary

2781
03:32:02,935 --> 03:32:11,757
pauses to pass as a number of other creatures and
individuals walk by. Passing efreeti, passing

2782
03:32:11,757 --> 03:32:20,535
occasionally some sort of giant, winged, red
creature that stalks down the street, dragging

2783
03:32:20,535 --> 03:32:30,692
behind it a large cart that has bars in it. You
can see a number of smaller, almost, I wouldn't

2784
03:32:30,692 --> 03:32:37,176
say fey-type creatures, but things that are
definitely not of this realm, that are all bound

2785
03:32:37,176 --> 03:32:48,682
by neck irons. You do also see a few small
families wander through, laughing, that appear to

2786
03:32:48,682 --> 03:32:54,967
be humanoid, but once again their physicality is
very similar to the individual Senokir.

2787
03:32:54,967 --> 03:33:09,130
Eventually, you are led back to a simple exterior.
It's a back entrance, leading away from this main

2788
03:33:09,130 --> 03:33:18,878
street. They both enter to this iron doorway.
Senokir pulls something from a pocket and glances

2789
03:33:18,878 --> 03:33:25,912
at the rest of you. He pricks his finger and
places it to the edge of this object, some sort of

2790
03:33:25,912 --> 03:33:31,367
a disk, and it has a small point on one end that
he uses to prick his finger. Once he's smeared his

2791
03:33:31,367 --> 03:33:37,371
blood on the disk, he presses it against the door,
and the iron door opens up a little bit. Places it

2792
03:33:37,371 --> 03:33:40,822
in his pocket. "Come inside, so we may speak,
please."

2793
03:33:40,822 --> 03:33:44,018
TALIESIN and LIAM: All right.

2794
03:33:44,018 --> 03:33:51,233
LAURA: I want to look in his eyes as we are about
to go through and see if-- how honest he looks.

2795
03:33:51,233 --> 03:33:53,460
MATT: Make an insight check.

2796
03:33:53,460 --> 03:33:59,116
LIAM: I mean, everybody in this city wants us as
slaves, so it's not really any more dangerous in

2797
03:33:59,116 --> 03:34:00,318
there than it is--

2798
03:34:00,318 --> 03:34:01,752
SAM: Kind of flattering, really.

2799
03:34:01,752 --> 03:34:06,843
LAURA: 21.

2800
03:34:06,843 --> 03:34:11,239
SAM: It's like one of those beefcake slave
auctions for charity.

2801
03:34:11,239 --> 03:34:18,244
MATT: Glancing at him, he's a very hard individual
to read. He has this awkward, stilted

2802
03:34:18,244 --> 03:34:25,018
conversational cadence to his way of speaking, and
whenever he speaks to you, he's not quite looking

2803
03:34:25,018 --> 03:34:26,757
at you.

2804
03:34:26,757 --> 03:34:28,722
LAURA: Hey, my eyes are down--

2805
03:34:28,722 --> 03:34:34,502
MATT: He doesn't seem dishonest, just hard to
read.

2806
03:34:34,502 --> 03:34:40,065
LAURA: All right. I like your hair. And I walk
in.

2807
03:34:40,065 --> 03:34:47,607
MATT: Okay. As you guys enter, these wall sconces
begin to come to life on their own across the

2808
03:34:47,607 --> 03:34:56,710
walls. On the inside, you can see this gorgeous
workspace for all sorts of small-level metallurgy

2809
03:34:56,710 --> 03:35:08,717
and metalcraft. Percy, you really appreciate this.
You see small furnaces and a number of metals laid

2810
03:35:08,717 --> 03:35:16,135
out in ingots, some used in different volumes.
Many substances and things that you've never seen

2811
03:35:16,135 --> 03:35:23,519
before. A couple of small boxes to the side of
rough, uncut gems, currently at this distance--

2812
03:35:23,519 --> 03:35:25,042
TALIESIN: My word.

2813
03:35:25,042 --> 03:35:31,169
LAURA: I walk up and smack Percy on the ass and
say, "Feel like making a home here?" and walk past him.

2814
03:35:31,169 --> 03:35:33,881
TALIESIN: I'm certainly thinking of some plans.

2815
03:35:33,881 --> 03:35:42,628
MATT: As the door closes behind and the two
individuals walk in, they rummage around and begin

2816
03:35:42,628 --> 03:35:49,867
finding some small stools and arrange them so they
can present to you more like, treat you like a

2817
03:35:49,867 --> 03:35:53,279
guest. He sets them down. "Please, sit, and we
shall speak."

2818
03:35:53,279 --> 03:35:56,765
TRAVIS: Okay!

2819
03:35:56,765 --> 03:36:00,008
LAURA: How long does Locate Object take to cast?

2820
03:36:00,008 --> 03:36:02,981
SAM: Well, that's not something you would ask
<i>him</i>. I think he's just our host here.

2821
03:36:02,981 --> 03:36:20,129
MATT: "I have no idea these words you speak." All
right, Locate Object. Locate Object is one action,

2822
03:36:20,129 --> 03:36:21,410
so it takes six seconds to cast.

2823
03:36:21,410 --> 03:36:24,798
LAURA: Can I try to cast it as we sit down and see
if it's in our vicinity?

2824
03:36:24,798 --> 03:36:26,531
SAM: You can cast that shit all the time?

2825
03:36:26,531 --> 03:36:28,634
TALIESIN: How often can you cast it?

2826
03:36:28,634 --> 03:36:32,164
LAURA: Well, it's a 2nd-level spell, so I can do
it a bit.

2827
03:36:32,164 --> 03:36:38,498
MATT: So as everyone's sitting on your stools and
getting ready, you close your eyes for a second,

2828
03:36:38,498 --> 03:36:45,562
concentrate, mutter beneath your breath. You
extend your understanding in this dark space

2829
03:36:45,562 --> 03:36:52,677
around you, waiting for the warmth of any sort of
call to the Dawnmartyr Plate. Eventually your

2830
03:36:52,677 --> 03:36:58,765
mental expansion reaches the limitations of the
spell, with nothing coming back.

2831
03:36:58,765 --> 03:37:04,498
LAURA: Tight, tight, tight.

2832
03:37:04,498 --> 03:37:11,683
MATT: As you've all sat down and assembled,
Senokir sits as well, hands crossed very

2833
03:37:11,683 --> 03:37:21,972
pleasantly in front of him. Very up straight,
strange head cocked a little to the side. "So

2834
03:37:21,972 --> 03:37:31,705
"you've found yourselves here, out of place, and
we've helped you once. We will discuss the terms

2835
03:37:31,705 --> 03:37:43,088
"of our repayment for our aid. But before then, I
must ask why you would come here so unprepared."

2836
03:37:43,088 --> 03:37:59,572
MARISHA: So unprepared? Does the name Thordak ring
a bell? The Cinder King? It's a pseudonym, maybe?

2837
03:37:59,572 --> 03:38:01,535
MATT: "I have heard this name."

2838
03:38:01,605 --> 03:38:05,754
SAM: Alias.

2839
03:38:05,754 --> 03:38:07,729
LAURA: Did he hang out around here?

2840
03:38:07,729 --> 03:38:12,885
MATT: "No. He stayed mostly over the Sea of
Fire."

2841
03:38:12,885 --> 03:38:20,252
LAURA: Hmm. Anywho!

2842
03:38:20,252 --> 03:38:27,361
SAM: What about that Plate of--? No? Maybe? I
mean, I don't know, what are we here for?

2843
03:38:27,361 --> 03:38:29,334
MATT: "What are you here for?"

2844
03:38:29,334 --> 03:38:32,326
MARISHA: Thordak has escaped into our realm--

2845
03:38:32,326 --> 03:38:35,565
MATT: "Good. Keep him away from here."

2846
03:38:35,565 --> 03:38:38,865
MARISHA: All right, that's what we want as well.

2847
03:38:38,865 --> 03:38:40,477
LIAM: You have a distaste for the wyrm?

2848
03:38:40,477 --> 03:38:42,529
MATT: "No, I just don't trust dragons."

2849
03:38:42,529 --> 03:38:46,082
TALIESIN: He's currently still linked to this
realm.

2850
03:38:46,082 --> 03:38:47,809
MATT: "Hmm."

2851
03:38:47,809 --> 03:38:52,150
TALIESIN: We are trying to take care of as much of
it as humanly possible.

2852
03:38:52,150 --> 03:38:54,037
MATT: "Heh. Humanly."

2853
03:38:54,037 --> 03:39:00,685
TALIESIN: As much as humanly possible. Perhaps a
little bit more. We are here for the little bit

2854
03:39:00,685 --> 03:39:05,068
more. We seek powers to help us defeat the
dragon.

2855
03:39:05,068 --> 03:39:08,754
MATT: "Perhaps I can be of aid. What powers do you
seek?"

2856
03:39:08,754 --> 03:39:10,673
LAURA: What powers can you do?

2857
03:39:10,673 --> 03:39:13,788
MATT: "I asked my question first."

2858
03:39:13,788 --> 03:39:16,004
SAM: So creepy!

2859
03:39:16,004 --> 03:39:23,002
TALIESIN: Perhaps it is time to lay it on the
line. Time is of the essence.

2860
03:39:23,002 --> 03:39:24,879
LIAM: Sure, go for it.

2861
03:39:24,879 --> 03:39:25,964
TALIESIN: Let's make a deal.

2862
03:39:25,964 --> 03:39:28,156
LIAM: If this goes south, we can just wrap it up.

2863
03:39:28,156 --> 03:39:32,137
TALIESIN: We seek a set of plate armor.

2864
03:39:32,137 --> 03:39:41,935
LAURA: A trinket, really. Nothing huge. Somebody
won it in a game of poker, I believe? Cards?

2865
03:39:41,935 --> 03:39:43,695
SAM: A card game of some sort.

2866
03:39:43,695 --> 03:39:47,356
TALIESIN: The Plate of the Dawnmartyr.

2867
03:39:47,356 --> 03:39:51,383
MARISHA: It used to belong to the Suutan
Bloodline.

2868
03:39:51,383 --> 03:39:54,835
MATT: "Suutan, now that I am aware of."

2869
03:39:54,835 --> 03:39:56,062
MARISHA: Yes?

2870
03:39:56,062 --> 03:39:59,877
MATT: "Does it still belong in the possession of
this Suutan?"

2871
03:39:59,877 --> 03:40:01,541
LAURA: I don't think so.

2872
03:40:01,541 --> 03:40:04,520
SAM: Our information says it does not.

2873
03:40:04,520 --> 03:40:06,770
MARISHA: It was won by a fire giant.

2874
03:40:06,770 --> 03:40:09,784
MATT: "A fire giant within this city?"

2875
03:40:09,784 --> 03:40:11,427
TALIESIN: That is our belief.

2876
03:40:11,427 --> 03:40:13,012
SAM: Are there any fire giants in this city?

2877
03:40:13,012 --> 03:40:16,296
MATT: "That narrows it down. There are only three
that live here--"

2878
03:40:16,296 --> 03:40:17,524
SAM: Oh, well that's great!

2879
03:40:17,524 --> 03:40:19,181
MATT: "--not under subjugation."

2880
03:40:19,181 --> 03:40:21,715
SAM: Happen to have their names?

2881
03:40:21,715 --> 03:40:24,694
LAURA: Do people under subjugation own a lot?"

2882
03:40:24,694 --> 03:40:30,392
MATT: "Generally, no. Those that own them, own
what they own. So maybe it's one of them. We can

2883
03:40:30,392 --> 03:40:33,649
"go ask."

2884
03:40:33,649 --> 03:40:35,232
SAM: Are they close?

2885
03:40:35,232 --> 03:40:39,834
MATT: "Relatively. Depending on which one you ask
first."

2886
03:40:39,834 --> 03:40:44,922
SAM: You could just give us their addresses or
something and we could go check it out. If you had a

2887
03:40:44,922 --> 03:40:46,520
Thomas Guide--?

2888
03:40:46,520 --> 03:40:47,511
LAURA: Where's Uten? What's Uten doing?

2889
03:40:47,511 --> 03:40:49,753
MATT: Uten is sitting back, arms crossed.

2890
03:40:49,753 --> 03:40:54,535
LAURA: He seems totally chill? This is the way
this dude talks all the fucking time?

2891
03:40:54,535 --> 03:40:57,642
(laughing)

2892
03:40:57,642 --> 03:40:59,615
MATT: Completely unfazed.

2893
03:40:59,615 --> 03:41:07,319
TALIESIN: Depending on how things go, we may even
speak of perhaps commissioning some pieces. Your

2894
03:41:07,319 --> 03:41:09,884
work is astounding.

2895
03:41:09,884 --> 03:41:15,203
MATT: He suddenly leans forward, steps up from the
stool, and walks over to you and begins to look

2896
03:41:15,203 --> 03:41:22,327
very closely over your clothing. "Can you afford
what I make?"

2897
03:41:22,327 --> 03:41:31,810
TALIESIN: Possibly. I would like to think so.
Depending on how the next few weeks go, there will

2898
03:41:31,810 --> 03:41:37,025
be much to celebrate, and your work is
celebratory.

2899
03:41:37,025 --> 03:41:41,456
LAURA: Do you require monetary compensation, or is
it something more?

2900
03:41:41,456 --> 03:41:51,449
MATT: "Depends. I have plenty of money, but you
owe me, and if I help you find this giant and this

2901
03:41:51,449 --> 03:42:00,082
"armor you're seeking, you will owe me even more.
So. To keep this interesting, how about we go find

2902
03:42:00,082 --> 03:42:01,994
"this armor?"

2903
03:42:01,994 --> 03:42:06,765
LIAM: You don't even want to hint at what you're
looking for?

2904
03:42:06,765 --> 03:42:10,647
MATT: "Where's the fun in that?"

2905
03:42:10,647 --> 03:42:13,322
LIAM: You cheeky bastard, Matthew Mercer.

2906
03:42:13,322 --> 03:42:19,930
MATT: "So. To the giant?"

2907
03:42:19,930 --> 03:42:27,681
LAURA: Should we make ourselves not look like us?
Should we maybe look like something different?

2908
03:42:27,681 --> 03:42:31,311
TRAVIS: Yeah, how will you keep us from being
harassed in the streets?

2909
03:42:31,311 --> 03:42:41,882
MATT: "Well, I mean no disrespect, but--" He lifts
his hand and snaps the fingers. You watch as Uten

2910
03:42:41,882 --> 03:42:48,649
goes, "Oh, right, sorry. I got you." He goes
rummaging through a case and you hear what sounds

2911
03:42:48,649 --> 03:42:56,713
like the dragging and clanging of many pieces of
small metal. Procures a series of chains and neck

2912
03:42:56,713 --> 03:43:08,394
irons. Senokir looks up. "There's not much else I
have to offer but, for the most part, you won't be

2913
03:43:08,394 --> 03:43:09,695
"bothered."

2914
03:43:09,695 --> 03:43:11,234
ASHLEY: Oh, you love it.

2915
03:43:11,234 --> 03:43:14,284
TALIESIN: Let me put forward a theory for you.

2916
03:43:14,284 --> 03:43:16,512
TRAVIS: You son of a bitch.

2917
03:43:16,512 --> 03:43:27,076
TALIESIN: I hate those eyes. I can't look at them.
I hate you. Whatever deal we make with you here,

2918
03:43:27,076 --> 03:43:35,844
for the record, none of us will be staying. We may
be coming back to fulfill some service, we may be

2919
03:43:35,844 --> 03:43:40,312
coming back to fulfill some favor, and we will if
that is the deal we make.

2920
03:43:40,312 --> 03:43:42,223
MATT: "If that is the deal we make."

2921
03:43:42,223 --> 03:43:49,878
TALIESIN: But the deal we make will not include
any of us. Is that understood? Is that agreeable?

2922
03:43:49,878 --> 03:43:53,122
SAM: Unless it's for a one-time sexual favor of
some sort.

2923
03:43:53,122 --> 03:43:54,758
TALIESIN: Only with him.

2924
03:43:54,758 --> 03:43:56,175
LAURA: In which case, take your pick.

2925
03:43:56,175 --> 03:43:57,141
SAM: I'm up for that.

2926
03:43:57,141 --> 03:43:58,575
TRAVIS: I'm up, too.

2927
03:43:58,575 --> 03:43:59,820
TALIESIN: Oh my god, you people.

2928
03:43:59,820 --> 03:44:07,051
MATT: "I think you will find our arrangements
agreeable."

2929
03:44:07,051 --> 03:44:13,852
TALIESIN: And I may have some things to excite you
with, as well. Stop it! I know you've been doing

2930
03:44:13,852 --> 03:44:15,005
it all game!

2931
03:44:15,005 --> 03:44:16,417
ASHLEY: That was me.

2932
03:44:16,417 --> 03:44:18,072
MARISHA: He said in accent.

2933
03:44:18,072 --> 03:44:27,629
MATT: "It seems we've found some semblance of an
accord for the time. Come, place these gently upon

2934
03:44:27,629 --> 03:44:30,166
"yourselves and we'll be on our way."

2935
03:44:30,166 --> 03:44:32,514
LAURA: Don't you have any white robes you can give
us instead?

2936
03:44:32,514 --> 03:44:39,802
MATT: "I'm sorry, no. Those come with station, and
station requires recognition. None will recognize

2937
03:44:39,802 --> 03:44:42,724
"you here. You'll be found out immediately."

2938
03:44:42,724 --> 03:44:47,824
SAM: Should we chain ourselves to each other, or
to you? How does this work?

2939
03:44:47,824 --> 03:44:50,860
LAURA: Check out those chains and see if they're
magic?

2940
03:44:50,860 --> 03:44:57,578
MARISHA: A few of us could look like you, to keep
all of us out of chains? Maybe a few exceptions?

2941
03:44:57,578 --> 03:45:01,984
LAURA: You can get big and then look like an
efreeti?

2942
03:45:01,984 --> 03:45:09,371
MARISHA: I can look like one of them. Very simply.
I think we'd all feel a little bit comfortable if

2943
03:45:09,371 --> 03:45:11,938
some of us were free.

2944
03:45:11,938 --> 03:45:19,186
MATT: "Sure. If you are confident."

2945
03:45:19,186 --> 03:45:23,806
MARISHA: I study him and I change to like a--

2946
03:45:23,806 --> 03:45:26,116
LAURA: Maybe somebody that is better at talking?

2947
03:45:26,116 --> 03:45:30,593
MARISHA: I don't have to talk, I just have to look
like someone else. That's not that hard.

2948
03:45:30,593 --> 03:45:31,809
TALIESIN: Oh for god's sakes.

2949
03:45:31,809 --> 03:45:37,235
SAM: I'm going to go look at the chains and arcana
check them.

2950
03:45:37,235 --> 03:45:38,657
MATT: Go for it.

2951
03:45:38,657 --> 03:45:46,402
MARISHA: I change myself to look like one of him.
I'm like, eh? Eh? Passable?

2952
03:45:46,402 --> 03:45:49,821
SAM: Oh, 22! No, just 20.

2953
03:45:49,821 --> 03:45:54,084
MATT: Just 20? The chains appear to be mundane.
They are heavy, they are thick, they are

2954
03:45:54,084 --> 03:45:55,915
definitely functional, but they are not
enchanted.

2955
03:45:55,915 --> 03:45:57,802
SAM: I'm going to slap some on.

2956
03:45:57,802 --> 03:46:02,847
LIAM: I'm going to slip on my ring of invisibility
and spend the next 20 minutes attuning to it.

2957
03:46:02,847 --> 03:46:15,739
MATT: He looks you over. "Impressive. I think you
will get no concern from myself when the other

2958
03:46:15,739 --> 03:46:17,702
"genasi cross your way."

2959
03:46:17,702 --> 03:46:23,208
MARISHA: (slowly) Do all of you talk like this? Do
I also need to talk like this?

2960
03:46:23,208 --> 03:46:25,320
MATT: "I don't know what you mean."

2961
03:46:25,320 --> 03:46:34,861
MARISHA: Never mind.

2962
03:46:34,861 --> 03:46:39,632
TRAVIS: I go put the chains on, as well.

2963
03:46:39,632 --> 03:46:41,001
TALIESIN: I put the chains on.

2964
03:46:41,001 --> 03:46:45,040
LAURA: I want to put them on, but I don't want to
click them. I want to hang them and make them look

2965
03:46:45,040 --> 03:46:46,999
like they're attached, but I don't want to attach
them.

2966
03:46:46,999 --> 03:46:50,179
MATT: Okay, make a sleight of hand check.

2967
03:46:50,179 --> 03:46:52,075
SAM: They fall to the floor!

2968
03:46:52,075 --> 03:46:55,880
ASHLEY: Are they wrist or--

2969
03:46:55,880 --> 03:46:58,649
MATT: There's one for each wrist and then a neck
iron.

2970
03:46:58,649 --> 03:47:00,105
LAURA: 11?

2971
03:47:00,105 --> 03:47:02,734
SAM: I'm familiar with these because I have a set
in my room.

2972
03:47:02,734 --> 03:47:09,222
MATT: Of course you do. The idea is, your hands
are chained, and the chains attack to the neck

2973
03:47:09,222 --> 03:47:13,534
iron about there, so you don't have a whole lot of
arm movement, and then the neck iron has a chain

2974
03:47:13,534 --> 03:47:19,513
from the back that is held. And actually, Uten
begins to gather all the chains at the very back

2975
03:47:19,513 --> 03:47:22,812
and runs them to a singular ring, which is held by
him.

2976
03:47:22,812 --> 03:47:34,978
ASHLEY: Can I put on, if I put on my Glove of
Storing, does that mean I have to take off one of

2977
03:47:34,978 --> 03:47:38,693
the gauntlets?

2978
03:47:38,693 --> 03:47:44,673
MATT: Glove of Storing, yeah. You wouldn't be able
to have both attuned because they're both on the hand.

2979
03:47:44,673 --> 03:47:45,906
ASHLEY: Can I wear one?

2980
03:47:45,906 --> 03:47:48,126
MATT: No, sorry.

2981
03:47:48,126 --> 03:47:59,510
TALIESIN: Just for insanity's sake, before I slip
them on, I'm going to take a little bit of

2982
03:47:59,510 --> 03:48:08,204
gunpowder out of my pouch and sprinkle a little
bit in the locks and have some on my hands.

2983
03:48:08,204 --> 03:48:09,816
LAURA: You're going to blow your little hands
off.

2984
03:48:09,816 --> 03:48:11,516
TALIESIN: Oh, it's going to be awful.

2985
03:48:11,516 --> 03:48:13,328
MATT: (Victor voice) "Learn from my mistakes!"

2986
03:48:13,328 --> 03:48:16,307
TALIESIN: Not enough to blow a hand off, but yes.

2987
03:48:16,307 --> 03:48:26,312
MATT: Okay. Vex, you manage to get them clicked
on, and as soon as you feel confident, they go

2988
03:48:26,312 --> 03:48:28,380
(clank) and hang open.

2989
03:48:28,380 --> 03:48:33,327
LAURA: Oh. I must have not attached them quite
right.

2990
03:48:33,327 --> 03:48:34,786
SAM: Do you want me to do it for you?

2991
03:48:34,786 --> 03:48:36,385
LAURA: Oh, no, that's okay.

2992
03:48:36,385 --> 03:48:39,079
TRAVIS: Please?

2993
03:48:39,079 --> 03:48:43,783
MATT: As all of the chains are attached, some time
has passed. You've attuned to your ring. What have

2994
03:48:43,783 --> 03:48:45,588
you un-attuned to?

2995
03:48:45,588 --> 03:48:48,134
LIAM: My boots have gone slack.

2996
03:48:48,134 --> 03:48:54,213
MATT: So you have the ring on. You're maintaining
your altered appearance. Uten takes all the chains

2997
03:48:54,213 --> 03:49:01,559
and clinks them onto the one ring. Gives it a tug,
just to check, and you all feel the tug from

2998
03:49:01,559 --> 03:49:06,169
behind. "Very well. It seems we are prepared.
Come, now, let us all go speak with Whaska."

2999
03:49:06,169 --> 03:49:10,997
LIAM: He didn't chain me, though, right? Am I
chained? There's no invisible floating chain?

3000
03:49:10,997 --> 03:49:15,200
MATT: No, he doesn't seem like he's intent on
chaining all of you. He just chained those that

3001
03:49:15,200 --> 03:49:17,283
couldn't pass.

3002
03:49:17,283 --> 03:49:21,409
SAM: Whaska the giant. Whaska the giant, right?

3003
03:49:21,409 --> 03:49:24,226
MATT: "Yes."

3004
03:49:24,226 --> 03:49:25,444
LIAM: Is Vex chained?

3005
03:49:25,444 --> 03:49:26,515
LAURA: I am.

3006
03:49:26,515 --> 03:49:28,590
LIAM: I tweak her nose and give her a wet willy,
and then dart six feet back.

3007
03:49:28,590 --> 03:49:30,543
LAURA: You fucking dick!

3008
03:49:30,543 --> 03:49:32,924
MATT: (chuckles)

3009
03:49:32,924 --> 03:49:37,226
(laughter)

3010
03:49:37,226 --> 03:49:46,921
MATT: "Now come! Uten, come." And he walks out the
front door, this time. As you guys are led through

3011
03:49:46,921 --> 03:49:53,419
the two front doors, as they open, as Senokir
pushes them, you see this wonderful thoroughfare

3012
03:49:53,419 --> 03:49:59,060
in front with a giant fountain that has this
molten rock, this lava fountain, that pours out

3013
03:49:59,060 --> 03:50:05,562
into this large, open pit that descends into
darkness below. You see these giant, black,

3014
03:50:05,562 --> 03:50:11,758
obelisk-like pillars that jut out in the center,
and probably about two dozen entities from all

3015
03:50:11,758 --> 03:50:15,507
walks of life walking through and having
conversations and talking, many of which having

3016
03:50:15,507 --> 03:50:22,809
their own chained slaves at their side. This
appears to be one of many central social civil

3017
03:50:22,809 --> 03:50:25,704
places within the City of Brass. And that's where
we'll end tonight's session.

3018
03:50:25,704 --> 03:50:34,953
TRAVIS: Did the people that have the people in
chains, are they wearing the white robes and stuff?

3019
03:50:34,953 --> 03:50:42,254
MATT: Different outfits. It appears that it isn't
like, the white robes signify that a person is

3020
03:50:42,254 --> 03:50:45,932
free. Just for these two, it's a level of station,
it seems, in the way they've described it.

3021
03:50:45,932 --> 03:50:50,119
SAM: Had we stopped in one more minute, I would
have had to take off this shirt, revealing nothing

3022
03:50:50,119 --> 03:50:51,361
underneath.

3023
03:50:51,361 --> 03:50:52,321
MATT: Shit!

3024
03:50:52,321 --> 03:50:55,614
TALIESIN: Not even his bare chest, just nothing.
The void.

3025
03:50:55,614 --> 03:50:59,036
SAM: Lava pouring in.

3026
03:50:59,036 --> 03:51:04,152
LIAM: We'll grab Ashley, run into the fire plane,
the armor will be right there, for her visit, and

3027
03:51:04,152 --> 03:51:05,733
then it'll be done! One shot.

3028
03:51:05,733 --> 03:51:08,720
MATT: You're not filming next Thursday, are you?

3029
03:51:08,720 --> 03:51:13,782
ASHLEY: I hope not. That's the first day of that
next episode, so I don't have the schedule yet.

3030
03:51:13,782 --> 03:51:16,708
MATT: Let me know. If you're not scheduled, we'll
try and Skype you in, because I would still like

3031
03:51:16,708 --> 03:51:17,932
you to continue this.

3032
03:51:17,932 --> 03:51:19,602
ASHLEY: I will. I'll have to Skype, but--

3033
03:51:19,602 --> 03:51:21,829
MATT: That's fine. Just having you here.

3034
03:51:21,829 --> 03:51:24,387
TRAVIS: Good to have you back, man!

3035
03:51:24,387 --> 03:51:27,027
LIAM: It's better when you're here!

3036
03:51:27,027 --> 03:51:29,185
ASHLEY: Oh, well, okay!

3037
03:51:29,185 --> 03:51:34,886
SAM: It's really better when you here. It's not
good when you're not here. In fact, don't watch

3038
03:51:34,886 --> 03:51:37,009
when she's not here.

3039
03:51:37,009 --> 03:51:43,412
ASHLEY: I felt like, maybe to everybody watching,
but I didn't feel like we were playing that long.

3040
03:51:43,412 --> 03:51:47,747
So you ended the game and I was like, "No! What?
We just-- oh."

3041
03:51:47,747 --> 03:51:53,646
MATT: It's been four hours! I know. Well, guys,
thank you for watching. I hope you had fun, as we

3042
03:51:53,646 --> 03:51:55,164
do, in this insanity.

3043
03:51:55,164 --> 03:51:57,871
ASHLEY: I love this character so much.

TALIESIN: He's my new favorite. The week <i>after</i>

03:52:03,651 --> 03:52:07,227
MATT: That's just how it worked out, guys!

3046
03:52:07,227 --> 03:52:13,912
TALIESIN: I'll never see Victor again. I have a
new best friend.

3047
03:52:13,912 --> 03:52:20,528
MATT: Guys, you're awesome. You're awesome. I'm
going to go home and sleep. Thank you, Loot Crate,

3048
03:52:20,528 --> 03:52:25,476
once again. Thank you to all you amazing Critters
in your amazing Halloween costumes. Still blown

3049
03:52:25,476 --> 03:52:31,339
away by all of that. Have a wonderful night, and
is it Thursday yet? See you next week.
