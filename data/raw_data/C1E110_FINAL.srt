1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:06,012
MATT: We've just returned from the chaos of Gen
Con, which was awesome, and we're all still

2
00:00:06,012 --> 00:00:09,295
recovering from that chaos. It was a very
high-energy weekend. We got to meet a lot of you

3
00:00:09,295 --> 00:00:13,300
guys out there. Didn't get to meet enough of you.
There's only so much time in the weekend, and

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,230
those that we didn't, we'll hopefully get a chance
to meet you at a future event. The live show went

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,765
really well. We hope people who were there enjoyed
it.

6
00:00:19,765 --> 00:00:27,706
Let's see. We have Laura and Travis coming in hot
right now. They'll be here as soon as they can. In

7
00:00:27,706 --> 00:00:33,465
the interim, couple announcements, couple fun
things. One, there will not be a standard episode

8
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:38,131
of Critical Role next week because me, Taliesin,
Marisha, Laura, and Travis will be off in the

9
00:00:38,131 --> 00:00:44,367
desert somewhere. Instead, there will be a
one-shot being run by none other than the

10
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:49,206
wonderful, illustrious, talented Sam Riegel. His
first game of any roleplaying game

11
00:00:49,206 --> 00:00:51,095
he's ever DMed before.

12
00:00:51,095 --> 00:00:58,563
SAM: I was just learning how to DM from Matt about
a minute ago! And I think I know.

13
00:00:58,563 --> 00:01:03,971
MATT: I think you've got this. You want to talk
about any of the people who will be playing with you?

14
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:14,803
SAM: Sure! My players that I will be controlling--
that's how it works, right, Matt? My players will

15
00:01:14,803 --> 00:01:26,088
be the talented and charming Liam O'Brien: dagger,
dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger; the charming and

16
00:01:26,088 --> 00:01:37,708
cabbage-smelling Brian Foster; friend of the show
and charming everything, Mary Elizabeth McGlynn;

17
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:47,193
young Ashly Burch, pulling some shit out of her
ass, I'm sure, which is going to be awesome; and

18
00:01:47,193 --> 00:01:55,020
then a player we have not played with yet. He's a
lovely voice actor and a talented man: Eric Bauza.

19
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,527
Look him up on IMDB. He's the voice of
everything.

20
00:01:58,527 --> 00:02:00,951
LIAM: Bauza is funny as fuck.

21
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:03,565
SAM: He has never played Dungeons and Dragons
before.

22
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:09,046
MATT: I'm legitimately sad that we're gone next
week. Just so we can't be in the wings, to watch

23
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,334
it in person.

24
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:12,809
MARISHA: We'll have a lot of road time to watch it
on the way back.

25
00:02:12,809 --> 00:02:20,379
LIAM: With Bauza at the table, any celebrity could
show up. He can impersonate anybody. Anybody.

26
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:25,603
MATT: He has about five or six years before he
becomes the voiceover industry. The living

27
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:31,918
embodiment of it. Absorbs us like end of Akira. So
that's going to be fun. Look forward to that next

28
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,958
week. Let's see, what else?

29
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,572
SAM: Merch, Laura-- oh.

30
00:02:37,572 --> 00:02:40,361
LIAM: Oh, there's some stuff in the store!

31
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:45,266
MARISHA: Oh man! So many good things!

32
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:50,158
LIAM: Okay, go to Geek and Sundry's dot com,
whatever the store is!

33
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:59,324
MATT: You're going to get the shit beat out of
you. She's watching it right now.

34
00:02:59,324 --> 00:03:05,400
TALIESIN: Oh. Well, then you're in trouble.

35
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,229
SAM: Is there a book update? Is there a sticker
update? Is there a shirt update?

36
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:18,690
MARISHA: There is a sticker update. We found them.
The mail has found them from where USPS quite

37
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:27,133
literally lost them. I think the distributor found
them and now they're bringing some back to the

38
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:31,159
distributor so they can be sent back to us, and
then we will be dropping those in the mail.

39
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:34,808
MATT: We'll be giving those to everyone who was
there at Gen Con and signed up. Whatever's left

40
00:03:34,808 --> 00:03:40,126
over, we'll get announcements up as to how we can
get those to some folks, as well. We've got a

41
00:03:40,126 --> 00:03:47,136
process on that one. The Tal'Dorei Campaign Guide
went well, apparently, at Gen Con. People seemed

42
00:03:47,136 --> 00:03:50,758
to like it. I hope you like it. I know they're
pushing hard to get those orders out, all

43
00:03:50,758 --> 00:03:58,358
pre-orders, by mid- to late-September. So follow
@GreenRoninPub at Twitter for any updates on when

44
00:03:58,358 --> 00:04:00,343
those'll be going out. Thank you very much.

45
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:05,265
LIAM: We should probably re-announce the art book
that we're making. There's an art book that's

46
00:04:05,265 --> 00:04:09,837
happening. It's going to hit in the fall, at some
point. It's amazing. We've seen it. We've held an

47
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:11,271
approximation of it.

48
00:04:11,271 --> 00:04:13,263
MATT: We've all sobbed silently as we've looked
through it.

49
00:04:13,263 --> 00:04:15,337
LIAM: It's beautiful.

50
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:19,071
MATT: It's the phenomenal celebration of
everything that you guys have put together around

51
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:24,234
this game and I'm so excited for you guys to see
it.

52
00:04:24,234 --> 00:04:27,570
MARISHA: It feels like a time capsule, but in a
book.

53
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:34,957
LIAM: And as long as we're vamping, I've seen some
of that comic book, man. It's looking good. It's

54
00:04:34,957 --> 00:04:38,408
under the table in my bag. It looks so good.

55
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:46,865
MATT: Our buddy Mr. Colville's done a fine job.
Olivia's done an amazing job, as well. Everyone

56
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:48,331
involved has been great.

57
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:51,237
MARISHA: It's so cute. We love it.

58
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:56,964
SAM: I think we've stalled all we can stall,
right? By the way, the reason Travis and Laura are

59
00:04:56,964 --> 00:05:05,154
not here is because we all brought our dice and
our little character sheets to Indianapolis, and

60
00:05:05,154 --> 00:05:07,886
they left theirs at home, so they drove home to go
get it.

61
00:05:07,886 --> 00:05:13,294
MARISHA: Yeah. Because you need a character sheet.
It's important when you've crawled into a

62
00:05:13,294 --> 00:05:15,806
mountain's butt.

63
00:05:15,806 --> 00:05:20,845
MATT: Yeah. That's what the name of this module is
going to be: Crawling into the Mountain's Butt.

64
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:22,672
Gygax would be proud.

65
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:26,508
LIAM: We're behind his meniscus, right? Aren't we
in his knee?

66
00:05:26,508 --> 00:05:30,531
MATT: Hip joint.

67
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:32,900
LIAM: Oh, real close to the butt, yeah!

68
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,296
MARISHA: Right in that sciatic nerve.

69
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:42,881
MATT: Bringing it into territory I'm very familiar
with right now.

70
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:47,868
MARISHA: Can we do that? Can we find pressure
points and take him down with acupressure?

71
00:05:47,868 --> 00:05:55,265
MATT: That's up to you guys. Oh, and for next
week, for Talks, I believe you're doing a special

72
00:05:55,265 --> 00:05:56,462
Talks Machina?

73
00:05:56,462 --> 00:05:59,773
LIAM: We're doing something. We're going to fuck
around.

74
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:05,048
SAM: I don't actually know. I'm laser-focused on
my shitty one-shot.

75
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:09,118
LIAM: Brian and I are chatting about it. You'll be
naked.

76
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:12,046
MARISHA: Thanks for tanking the week for us.

77
00:06:12,046 --> 00:06:19,604
SAM: We're also doing Wednesday Club, me and Liam.
We're going to be talking about my favorite book, Hellboy.

78
00:06:19,604 --> 00:06:24,130
LIAM: I'm going to be bringing in a bag of Bazooka Joe
comics, from the gum.

79
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:36,159
MARISHA: Oh, I have something I can stall time
with. For those who didn't catch the debut episode

80
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:45,973
of One Night Only, it was awesome. We talked about
Sagas of Sundry: Dread. We dressed up. We made it

81
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:55,207
an event. One Night Only is our special event
series that we are attempting to do monthly, is

82
00:06:55,207 --> 00:07:03,705
the goal. Where we bring you people from your
favorite fandom in entertainment and pop culture

83
00:07:03,705 --> 00:07:08,524
and get to ask questions with them, panel-style.
Inside the Actors Studio style.

84
00:07:08,524 --> 00:07:12,265
SAM: Are you James Lipton in this equation?

85
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:18,758
MARISHA: Well, it was Darin De Paul this past
week. We're going to switch it up, depending on

86
00:07:18,758 --> 00:07:29,259
what the subject matter is. I really want to do a
JPL One Night Only, where we bring all the smart

87
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:32,131
scientist dudes from NASA.

88
00:07:32,131 --> 00:07:36,082
LIAM: I'm sure there are Critters in Space-X.

89
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:47,563
MARISHA: And then for those who missed it, we
announced at the end of One Night Only that there

90
00:07:47,563 --> 00:07:54,468
will be a season two of Sagas of Sundry, entitled
Madness.

91
00:07:54,468 --> 00:08:00,848
TALIESIN: Yeah, suddenly I showed up and there's
30 yards of red velvet that I've been begging for.

92
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:04,277
LIAM: Boy, let me tell you what I had for lunch
today.

93
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:14,363
SAM: We're essentially doing an episode of
allworknoplay right now. Should we start? Maybe by

94
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:15,772
the time you're done--

95
00:08:15,772 --> 00:08:17,721
MATT: I think at this point, we need to.

96
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:27,637
LIAM: I will jaeger Pike, Grog, and Vex. It will
be fine. "Titties. Let's do it."

97
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:40,753
MATT: Anyway. (laughs) That being the case, as we
await the return of two of our players, let us

98
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:46,224
begin tonight's journey on tonight's episode of
Critical Role.

99
00:08:46,224 --> 00:10:16,368
[dramatic music]

100
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:22,670
MATT: Hello, and welcome back. So. Last we left
off on this adventure--

101
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:30,372
(giggling)

102
00:10:30,372 --> 00:10:40,106
MATT: Goddamn it, Liam. Last we left off on this
adventure, Vox Machina had been counting down

103
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:47,036
their preparations to the eventual showdown and
second battle with Vecna, whom they discovered

104
00:10:47,036 --> 00:10:53,297
recently had completed his ascension into godhood,
the only god on the Prime Material Plane. Not

105
00:10:53,297 --> 00:10:58,228
knowing what his plans were, you began to bring
together what information you had, upon gathering

106
00:10:58,228 --> 00:11:04,415
blessings from different deities and pieces of
their divinity to craft the Prime Trammels, a

107
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:07,319
device that was once used to seal the Chained
Oblivion, long ago.

108
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:12,705
You traveled deep beneath the volcano of
Scaldseat, beneath the ocean, off the coast of

109
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:17,972
Issylra. Between Percival and Grog's newfound
imbuement of skills and knowledge via Ioun, you

110
00:11:17,972 --> 00:11:24,920
managed to successfully defeat the guardian, craft
the trammels and return to Vasselheim, where you

111
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:32,479
discovered via Pike that there was a council
meeting happening within the Platinum Sanctuary.

112
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:36,312
There you met up with the Hand of Ord.

113
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:40,459
MARISHA: Yeah, everyone was there.

114
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:48,257
MATT: High Hierophant Ophera of the Birthheart. There
was Earthbreaker Groon. There were Maidens of the

115
00:11:48,257 --> 00:11:55,291
Raven. Eventually, Allura and Kima, and J'mon Sa
Ord had also come into the fray.

116
00:11:55,291 --> 00:12:02,315
During this discussion about what to do, what to
handle, you were granted a ring by High Bearer

117
00:12:02,315 --> 00:12:08,450
Vord that, within a certain radius, could prevent
divinations or specifically scrying on you. Not

118
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:13,806
the School of Divination, but magics that divine
your location, whatever's in your vicinity.

119
00:12:13,806 --> 00:12:21,672
This moment, the council was interrupted by an
image of Vecna taunting you, until it was

120
00:12:21,672 --> 00:12:29,012
dispelled by Allura. The discussion was that
something was going on in the mountain range where

121
00:12:29,012 --> 00:12:34,016
Vecna seemed to have Thar Amphala, which had been
discovered by a couple of surviving wyvern riders.

122
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:40,764
Thinking about the two possible locations that
could be of interest to Vecna, you gathered your

123
00:12:40,764 --> 00:12:47,226
materials, your preparations, and with the first
striking lot of wyvern riders, on the back of the

124
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:55,309
newly transformed J'mon Sa Ord into the Devo'ssa
dragon form, you were transported via druids to

125
00:12:55,309 --> 00:13:00,908
the northern icy landscape of Issylra, to the base
of the Zenwick Mountains.

126
00:13:00,908 --> 00:13:07,828
You discovered that the Crypts of Thomara, an
ancient, forgotten dwarven society that had

127
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:14,039
destroyed itself through cannibalism and madness
was now a sinkhole in the mountain range, and a

128
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:24,721
series of large, heavy, 150-plus-foot-across
cavernous openings in the ground formed a pattern

129
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:34,357
that you soon discovered were footfalls. Steps.
You came upon the risen undead primordial earth

130
00:13:34,357 --> 00:13:44,082
titan, long left beneath the surface of the world,
dead since the Founding, now given unlife and

131
00:13:44,082 --> 00:13:51,925
walking its way southeast towards Vasselheim. Atop
its shoulders, you saw Thar Amphala, protected by

132
00:13:51,925 --> 00:13:54,241
some sort of magical barrier.

133
00:13:54,241 --> 00:14:00,589
There you struggled with a few fleets of flying
gloomstalkers that were charging their way towards

134
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:09,697
you. You turned yourself invisible through both
Scanlan and J'mon Sa Ord-- J'mon or Devo'ssa: both

135
00:14:09,697 --> 00:14:18,156
forms, same person-- you managed to, thanks to a
very high roll from Keyleth, discover there was a

136
00:14:18,156 --> 00:14:25,452
waterfall or trickle of liquid near the hip of
this giant titan. Its giant, four, swinging arms

137
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:32,954
of imminent danger in its vicinity only managed to
clip Keyleth and Vax once.

138
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:40,160
Surviving the impact, you all gathered at this
ingress right around the hip of the titan, where

139
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,204
you leapt off the dragon and proceeded to make
your way in. Keyleth, using Control Water, was

140
00:14:45,204 --> 00:14:52,651
keeping the heavy flow of an underground river
from blowing you off the broken steps that lead

141
00:14:52,651 --> 00:14:57,644
into your entry. And that is where we left off.

142
00:14:57,644 --> 00:15:06,540
At this time, Keyleth, as you're all standing,
looking over your shoulder, you can see the

143
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:12,944
opening where you entered. It's this giant view
through this window where you can see down below

144
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:17,010
the mountains and the valleys and the
landscapes outside. You can hear the wind blowing

145
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:24,376
though and battering like a heavy, deep whistle.
Oh! And we have the rest of our party. Perfect

146
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:25,686
timing. Welcome.

147
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:29,928
SAM: Okay, we'll start from announcements again.

148
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:34,131
LIAM: I did a very good job with merchandise.

149
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:40,402
LAURA: Did you? What did you say about
merchandise?

150
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:44,147
SAM: He didn't say anything, but he did a great
impression of you.

151
00:15:44,147 --> 00:15:52,106
LAURA: Cool. Sorry about that.

152
00:15:52,106 --> 00:15:56,801
SAM: A professional is on time, Laura.

153
00:15:56,801 --> 00:16:00,444
TRAVIS: It was actually up to me to remember, and
I didn't. She was closest to home.

154
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:10,059
MATT: So thank you, Laura. As you all stand on the
outside of the opening of this titan ingress, the

155
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:16,590
slick stone steps that break off and crumble into
the open expanse where you can plummet hundreds of

156
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:21,613
feet to your death, should you slip. Keyleth is
holding the water at bay, keeping the flow from

157
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:27,835
pushing you all back outside of the large earth
entity. Gathering your strength, you watch as

158
00:16:27,835 --> 00:16:34,046
J'mon Sa Ord's brass dragon form flies just
outside of your visual range. You now all stand

159
00:16:34,046 --> 00:16:39,208
within this 15-foot-wide entryway. What do you
do?

160
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:45,078
TALIESIN: Is there a passage so we can get out of
the flow of the water, once it's been released?

161
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:51,503
MATT: Currently, the flow mostly covers about ten
to 15 feet of this opening. It flows downward.

162
00:16:51,503 --> 00:16:56,799
It's not super strong, but it's enough where it
would be somewhat dangerous to some of you.

163
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,810
However, Keyleth is keeping it at bay for as long
as she can concentrate.

164
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:04,403
LIAM: If she weren't controlling it, would there
still be, even though it's dangerous, some air?

165
00:17:04,403 --> 00:17:11,822
MATT: Yeah. It may be up to your knees as far as
the flow. It's a possible slip, and you're

166
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,931
fighting the current to push you outside of the
titan.

167
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:24,091
MARISHA: It's concentration up to ten minutes, so
let's move quickly.

168
00:17:24,091 --> 00:17:27,334
SAM: So we're going in? Into the giant?

169
00:17:27,334 --> 00:17:29,951
TALIESIN: Well, it's either that or back out.

170
00:17:29,951 --> 00:17:34,082
LAURA: Do I still have Pass Without a Trace on
us?

171
00:17:34,082 --> 00:17:41,527
MATT: You haven't lost concentration on it, so I
imagine so. What's the marching order, by the way?

172
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,423
LIAM: I'll be up front.

173
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:46,301
MATT: All right, we have Vax up front. Who's
next?

174
00:17:46,301 --> 00:17:50,673
MARISHA: I'll be behind Vax, since we touched down
first, I guess.

175
00:17:50,673 --> 00:17:52,771
MATT: All right, Keyleth's after Vax. Who's next?

176
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,358
LAURA: I will be behind them.

177
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:57,761
MATT: All right. Is Trinket still in your
necklace?

178
00:17:57,761 --> 00:18:00,043
LAURA: Yeah, I'm bamfing him out right now.

179
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:04,188
MATT: Okay. Trinket is out, next to you. Who's
after Vex?

180
00:18:04,188 --> 00:18:07,237
SAM: I will be lucky Pierre, right in the middle.

181
00:18:07,237 --> 00:18:10,378
LIAM: Pike will walk right in front of Grog.

182
00:18:10,378 --> 00:18:12,243
TRAVIS: I'll be the caboose.

183
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:16,186
TALIESIN: I'll be between Pike and Grog, right
there.

184
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:25,025
MATT: Okay. Good to know. Slick steps across the
smooth stone walkway. The water, however, being

185
00:18:25,025 --> 00:18:29,837
kept at bay by Keyleth. You watch as this river is
being curled back into itself. The flow is being

186
00:18:29,837 --> 00:18:37,104
staunched. It's briefly frozen in time. It's a
unique thing to see, especially as there is no

187
00:18:37,104 --> 00:18:43,665
light source inside, so you can see, especially
those of you with darkvision, the flow and the

188
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:48,962
movement. It swirls back on itself and seems to be
contained in that space. As you push up, bits of

189
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:52,558
it splash and trickle out to the side, but for the
most part you maintain complete control of this flow.

190
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:59,992
As you continue up the cracked stone stairs,
there's a slight right curvature up into this

191
00:18:59,992 --> 00:19:06,365
shaded area. The roof of this opening is maybe ten
feet tall. It dips down, with some of the rough

192
00:19:06,365 --> 00:19:13,326
rock outside and ceiling area of this, to about
seven to six feet. Grog, you have to dip down a

193
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:19,245
few times. You see hints of stalactites that you
have to maneuver around and push through. It's not

194
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:24,429
a huge opening, and it seems to vary in its size.
With each heavy footfall, you have to catch

195
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:30,905
yourself on the wall as the impact and the shake,
the (crashing) of each step of the titan you're

196
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:38,360
within seems to cause you to shift slightly, and a
faint bit of dust be released from the tunnel

197
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,674
around you.

198
00:19:39,674 --> 00:19:47,239
LIAM: Because we don't know what part of this is
the titan's butt and earth, but some of it could

199
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:51,256
have been made by cannibal dwarves at some point,
I'm going to assume I'm looking for traps and

200
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,048
listening for undead cannibal dwarves.

201
00:19:54,048 --> 00:19:56,776
MATT: Okay, so you're taking a very slow
approach.

202
00:19:56,776 --> 00:20:02,506
MARISHA: Actually, that's a good point. Does this
look like it was carved by man from cannibal

203
00:20:02,506 --> 00:20:06,126
dwarves, or nature-made?

204
00:20:06,126 --> 00:20:07,813
MATT: Make an investigation check.

205
00:20:07,813 --> 00:20:09,518
MARISHA: Investigation, or nature check?

206
00:20:09,518 --> 00:20:12,956
MATT: This would not be a nature check.

207
00:20:12,956 --> 00:20:23,281
MARISHA: My better one? That doesn't count. No,
nope. Four total.

208
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:31,907
MATT: Much of this tunnel seems to be natural
cavern, but there were steps when you first came

209
00:20:31,907 --> 00:20:36,613
in. There were stone steps that were carved or
placed within the dirt that eventually were

210
00:20:36,613 --> 00:20:45,381
consumed or covered by silt and loose earth and
whatever the river knocked loose and began to flow

211
00:20:45,381 --> 00:20:50,576
over it. So you can see both. A lot of this is
natural, but there seem to be, at least in the 30

212
00:20:50,576 --> 00:21:00,555
or 40 feet you've made into the tunnel, you've
seen elements of civilization, of crafted entry,

213
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:03,149
that merge with the terrain.

214
00:21:03,149 --> 00:21:09,104
MARISHA: Did we get a time frame of how long ago
this crypt was built before? How old this crypt

215
00:21:09,104 --> 00:21:10,162
has been around?

216
00:21:10,162 --> 00:21:17,049
MATT: Early Age of Arcanum, so best estimate from
what you knew, you guys both learning of the

217
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:22,944
history of this, well over 1,500 years, if not
longer.

218
00:21:22,944 --> 00:21:28,915
SAM: Before the great war thing?

219
00:21:28,915 --> 00:21:32,489
MATT: After the Founding, which was the first
great war, where the titans were slaughtered.

220
00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:37,225
Beginning of the Age of Arcanum, which was long
before the Divergence.

221
00:21:37,225 --> 00:21:46,424
TRAVIS: Can I touch the ground, now that we're in
the titan? I'm thinking maybe this might be where

222
00:21:46,424 --> 00:21:50,269
the Knuckles are from. Can I touch it and see if
the oven mitts do anything?

223
00:21:50,269 --> 00:22:00,682
MATT: Their general, faint vibration never stops.
There's a perpetual, very minute hum to them.

224
00:22:00,682 --> 00:22:06,877
Touching it doesn't seem to have any effect or
change. The proximity seems to be triggering some

225
00:22:06,877 --> 00:22:08,922
sort of harmonization.

226
00:22:08,922 --> 00:22:19,058
TRAVIS: I reach up and touch my Adam's apple and
(vibrating) this place is crazy. Sorry. No, you

227
00:22:19,058 --> 00:22:21,371
wouldn't do it? I thought you would.

228
00:22:21,371 --> 00:22:27,573
MATT: All right, so make an investigation check,
Vax, as you slowly lead the group up this slightly

229
00:22:27,573 --> 00:22:29,236
curving tunnel.

230
00:22:29,236 --> 00:22:34,801
LIAM: That is a 27.

231
00:22:34,801 --> 00:22:36,718
MATT: 27, okay.

232
00:22:36,718 --> 00:22:39,331
LAURA: I didn't get to sort them.

233
00:22:39,331 --> 00:22:41,049
MATT: Well, you should do that now.

234
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:44,560
TALIESIN: Chaos. Introducing chaos.

235
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:52,254
MATT: As you guys slowly make your way along the
path, behind Vax, you look out and occasionally

236
00:22:52,254 --> 00:22:58,769
see bits of loose earth that looks looser than
most. As you brush it aside, you can see the steps

237
00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:05,747
continue. A lot of it's been buried, but this was
a staircase that slowly ascended and curved. The

238
00:23:05,747 --> 00:23:10,675
movement of the titan seems to have knocked a lot
of the loose tunnel to cover it. As you brush it

239
00:23:10,675 --> 00:23:18,925
aside, you carefully look about, and you can see
that there are occasional symbols of a writing you

240
00:23:18,925 --> 00:23:23,685
don't understand, but nothing stands out to you as
a trap or a trigger.

241
00:23:23,685 --> 00:23:26,560
MARISHA: Does it look familiar to any of us?

242
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,323
MATT: What languages do you guys know?

243
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:35,200
TRAVIS: Why are you even looking over here? I know
stick figures. I know charades.

244
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,577
MATT: Do any of you know Dwarven?

245
00:23:38,577 --> 00:23:43,457
LAURA: You can read Dwarven now! You can read now,
Grog. You can read four- to five-letter words.

246
00:23:43,457 --> 00:23:46,730
TRAVIS: I can read Dwarven because of the belt.

247
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:50,241
SAM: But only tiny bits.

248
00:23:50,241 --> 00:23:52,424
TRAVIS: Yeah, I might fuck up the bigger pieces.

249
00:23:52,424 --> 00:24:02,282
MATT: Grog, as Vax points out some of these
symbols, you sit there and concentrate really hard

250
00:24:02,282 --> 00:24:10,865
on one of the carvings in the recently uncovered
stone step. As you focus, you begin to sound out

251
00:24:10,865 --> 00:24:20,399
the sound to yourself repeatedly. (hesitant
syllables) You're trying to find the right way to

252
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:21,541
pronounce it.

253
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:25,023
TRAVIS: Baa-ram-ewe. Babe, anyone?

254
00:24:25,023 --> 00:24:32,319
MATT: It takes you about two to three minutes to
sound this out, which knocks about two to three

255
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:42,679
minutes off of your concentration time for your
Control Water spell. But this looks to be carved

256
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:44,874
in as a warning.

257
00:24:44,874 --> 00:24:48,975
TRAVIS: Du. Du hast. Du hast mich.

258
00:24:48,975 --> 00:24:54,235
(laughter)

259
00:24:54,235 --> 00:24:58,758
MATT: Strangely, if you could have seen Thomara
when it was a highly functioning society, they

260
00:24:58,758 --> 00:25:02,045
would have been blasting Rammstein everywhere,
man.

261
00:25:02,045 --> 00:25:05,602
LIAM: Speak Rammstein and enter.

262
00:25:05,602 --> 00:25:14,175
MATT: Yeah, these weren't the happy-go-lucky
dwarves of old. This was a brutal clan.

263
00:25:14,175 --> 00:25:18,156
TRAVIS: It looks like a warning of some kind.

264
00:25:18,156 --> 00:25:23,762
MATT: The rough translation from what you can--
spending about five minutes or so breaking out

265
00:25:23,762 --> 00:25:33,781
this glyph and a few other glyphs, it says,
"Leave. Death here. No further."

266
00:25:33,781 --> 00:25:50,897
TRAVIS: Right, it says, "Leaves, death here, no
further." So leaves, death here, leaves of death

267
00:25:50,897 --> 00:25:55,674
here, but no further. I'm still working it out.

268
00:25:55,674 --> 00:26:01,114
SAM: Maybe it's "no fur." Maybe we should leave
Trinket. I'm just saying, that's the furriest one.

269
00:26:01,114 --> 00:26:02,921
I don't want Trinket to die.

270
00:26:02,921 --> 00:26:05,851
LAURA: Thanks, Scanlan.

271
00:26:05,851 --> 00:26:12,805
MARISHA: I feel like we already knew so much of
that.

272
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:18,323
TRAVIS: I've been working really hard. That was
five minutes of the most concentration I've ever

273
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:22,366
given to one thing in my life. Thanks.

274
00:26:22,366 --> 00:26:26,155
MARISHA: Okay, let's get up this river before I
lose concentration.

275
00:26:26,155 --> 00:26:39,767
MATT: You push up another 60 or so feet, Vax still
keeping the point man on this. Slowly pulling

276
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:48,421
forward, you begin to hear the sound of rushing
water growing louder and louder. You eventually

277
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:52,831
come across the rift in the ceiling that is
spilling forth the water that is forming this

278
00:26:52,831 --> 00:26:59,194
river. It looks like there is a recent crack and a
piece of eroded earth that has fallen out from

279
00:26:59,194 --> 00:27:06,454
some sort of water source further up inside the
titan that is causing this river to continuously

280
00:27:06,454 --> 00:27:09,200
run in and out of this titan.

281
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:16,453
SAM: How does this work? How much water could a
titan hold?

282
00:27:16,453 --> 00:27:18,606
MARISHA: Well, this thing is massive.

283
00:27:18,606 --> 00:27:22,953
SAM: I know, but is there a barrel of water in his
chest?

284
00:27:22,953 --> 00:27:27,425
MARISHA: Maybe a lake? An underground lake?

285
00:27:27,425 --> 00:27:34,017
TALIESIN: We're always impressed by how much water
comes out of <i>you</i>.

286
00:27:34,017 --> 00:27:43,152
MATT: At this point, you guys would be able to
move around and continue up past where this

287
00:27:43,152 --> 00:27:46,479
opening is, and the river would no longer be
impeding your path.

288
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:51,822
LAURA: Let's do that. Keep moving up, right?
That's where the city is.

289
00:27:51,822 --> 00:27:53,235
SAM: Sure.

290
00:27:53,235 --> 00:28:00,005
MARISHA: Hang on. Can I do a nature check? Is
there anything weird about this?

291
00:28:00,005 --> 00:28:06,420
LAURA: While she's doing a nature check, I want to
do Primeval Awareness and sense undead in the

292
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:11,830
area. Within a mile of me.

293
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:20,415
MATT: Okay. <i>Many</i>.

294
00:28:20,415 --> 00:28:23,825
LAURA: Within the mile?

295
00:28:23,825 --> 00:28:33,313
MATT: Within a mile, which is the entirety of the
titan, many. Thousands.

296
00:28:33,313 --> 00:28:39,767
TRAVIS: But they're probably in inoperable
pieces.

297
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:43,769
LAURA: Are they all above us or are some near us?

298
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:48,724
MATT: Nothing within the very immediate vicinity. Due
to the limitations of Primeval Awareness, which

299
00:28:48,724 --> 00:28:56,159
does not show you the exact location, you sense
the presence and vague direction. Forward and

300
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:04,060
upward, there is this giant mass of undead force
that the minute you focus, it causes you to hold

301
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:09,500
your breath. As soon as the impact hits you, you
have to remind yourself to exhale.

302
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:15,679
SAM: But maybe they're all hypnotized or
something.

303
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,042
MARISHA: 17?

304
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:23,951
MATT: Okay. The structural damage appears to be
natural. As you pay attention and watch as another

305
00:29:23,951 --> 00:29:29,906
footfall of the titan hits (crashing) and it
shakes, you watch as another piece of rock falls

306
00:29:29,906 --> 00:29:34,769
and a little of the water flow expands to allow a
little more water to exit. You get the sense that,

307
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:37,766
as the titan moves, the longer it travels--

308
00:29:37,766 --> 00:29:39,950
MARISHA: The more it's going to fall apart?

309
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:45,822
MATT: Or at least portions of it that were built
into the titan, that aren't part of its natural body--

310
00:29:45,822 --> 00:29:47,371
MARISHA: Start to crumble?

311
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:48,765
MATT: Some of them may.

312
00:29:48,765 --> 00:29:50,981
LAURA: What if we Earthquake the titan?

313
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:52,371
SAM: To do what?

314
00:29:52,371 --> 00:29:54,084
LAURA: To fucking fall apart!

315
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:55,556
SAM: But we're in it.

316
00:29:55,556 --> 00:29:58,153
LAURA: Yeah, but we could take out the entire
city.

317
00:29:58,153 --> 00:29:59,559
SAM: We're in it!

318
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:02,231
TALIESIN: Last time we did that, it kept floating
up top.

319
00:30:02,231 --> 00:30:06,976
LAURA: But it couldn't move for a while.

320
00:30:06,976 --> 00:30:11,830
MARISHA: We have to get to the top. This thing is
too big. I don't think my Earthquake will do enough.

321
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,053
LIAM: It's in the grab bag. It's an option.

322
00:30:14,053 --> 00:30:19,601
TRAVIS: If we're inside the GI tract of this titan
and we give it an Earthquake, is it basically like

323
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:26,671
a big old dead titan fart?

324
00:30:26,671 --> 00:30:32,749
LAURA: Potentially. It could shit out a lot of
dwarven zombies.

325
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:35,645
TALIESIN: It is also an option if we do get
overrun.

326
00:30:35,645 --> 00:30:37,527
TRAVIS: True.

327
00:30:37,527 --> 00:30:40,346
MARISHA: Did you learn it today, Pike?

328
00:30:40,346 --> 00:30:42,662
LAURA: "Yeah."

329
00:30:42,662 --> 00:30:45,338
SAM: Oh, we're playing Pike?

330
00:30:45,338 --> 00:30:47,197
LIAM: We're playing Pike.

331
00:30:47,197 --> 00:30:48,599
SAM: You two?

332
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,418
LIAM: We are. We're the Pike jaegers.

333
00:30:50,418 --> 00:30:51,980
SAM: Okay.

334
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,940
LAURA: Mostly Liam.

335
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:59,317
LIAM: You can do the impression, and I will sort
through the pages.

336
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:05,534
MATT: There you go. As you guys descend past the
rushing water, the sound of the river begins to

337
00:31:05,534 --> 00:31:14,025
slowly fade behind you as you continue to spiral
upward, this slow crawling, ascending tunnel. The

338
00:31:14,025 --> 00:31:21,250
dirt that consumes the stairs at your feet
eventually begins to give away as your feet find

339
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:27,857
purchase in softer earth from loose gravel and the
rocky terrain. As you continue to push further and

340
00:31:27,857 --> 00:31:37,486
further into the interior of this titan, you feel
another heavy impacting footfall, and all of you

341
00:31:37,486 --> 00:31:45,402
have to brace yourself against the nearby wall,
this impact seeming heavier than others, and as it

342
00:31:45,402 --> 00:31:48,358
does, a number of rocks tumble past.

343
00:31:48,358 --> 00:31:50,716
LAURA: What do you think he just did? Do you think
he just fell?

344
00:31:50,716 --> 00:31:52,239
SAM: Maybe?

345
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:54,758
TALIESIN: I think he swung at something.

346
00:31:54,758 --> 00:32:03,315
MATT: Another footfall.

347
00:32:03,315 --> 00:32:18,659
Another footfall. Every single hit seems to cause
the foreign structures on the inside to-- hope

348
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:26,797
that they were made well. Another heavy footfall
hits even heavier than the last, and this one, the

349
00:32:26,797 --> 00:32:30,492
impact hits so hard that you guys are almost
thrown to your knees as you reach out, and you

350
00:32:30,492 --> 00:32:39,524
hear this loud crack sound above you. I need
Scanlan, Pike, Percival, and Grog to make a

351
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,221
dexterity saving throw, please.

352
00:32:41,221 --> 00:32:42,909
SAM: Dex, huh?

353
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:44,263
MATT: Yep.

354
00:32:44,263 --> 00:32:49,556
LIAM: Pike needs to do it too, right?

355
00:32:49,556 --> 00:32:51,102
MATT: Yep.

356
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:56,217
TRAVIS: Natural 20. Gil coming in in the clutch!

357
00:32:56,217 --> 00:32:59,243
TALIESIN: 15.

358
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:01,086
SAM: 13.

359
00:33:01,086 --> 00:33:03,211
LIAM: 13 for the other gnome.

360
00:33:03,211 --> 00:33:12,699
MATT: All right. Everyone but Grog, you glance up
just in time to watch as a large piece of the

361
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:19,009
tunnel ceiling dislodges and comes plummeting down
in your direction. Grog, you dive out of the way,

362
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:23,720
being clipped off the shoulder, but you manage to
avoid most of the impact. The rest of you,

363
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:31,725
however, immediately get buried by rock and broken
earth, suffering 29 points of bludgeoning damage

364
00:33:31,725 --> 00:33:36,830
to Percival, Pike, and Scanlan. And they are
buried and restrained right now,

365
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,415
unable to breathe.

366
00:33:38,415 --> 00:33:44,503
TRAVIS: I go over and I start-- boulders, dirt,
everything.

367
00:33:44,503 --> 00:33:50,908
MATT: Between all of you guys able to help, it's a
negligible period of time, and it wasn't too heavy

368
00:33:50,908 --> 00:33:55,891
of an impact. You manage to get them free over the
next five or so minutes. They get their breath

369
00:33:55,891 --> 00:34:02,277
back. A bit battered, but you get the sense that
you should travel quickly.

370
00:34:02,277 --> 00:34:06,630
LAURA: We'll keep going quickly, then.

371
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:14,231
MATT: Picking up the pace, you continue up the
curvature of the upward ascension. It's probably

372
00:34:14,231 --> 00:34:23,283
been about 60 or 70 feet since you've seen any
carved portion of terrain, any sign of previous

373
00:34:23,283 --> 00:34:31,809
dwarven construct or building or architecture. As
the tunnel stops at the curve, it eventually,

374
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:39,423
looking ahead, ascends a bit, about a ten-foot
climb up onto a plateau of some kind. You can see

375
00:34:39,423 --> 00:34:46,084
some weird root-like tree is growing out of one
wall and seems to be dead and petrified in its

376
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,730
current space. Do you guys wish to ascend to the
plateau?

377
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,738
LAURA: We probably should, right?

378
00:34:51,738 --> 00:34:53,207
LIAM: How far away is it?

379
00:34:53,207 --> 00:34:55,538
MATT: It's about 40 feet from you right now.

380
00:34:55,538 --> 00:34:58,626
LIAM: I'm going to creep up 20 feet in front of
everybody else.

381
00:34:58,626 --> 00:35:02,988
LAURA: I want to go with him. I need to keep an
eye out for the zombie dwarves.

382
00:35:02,988 --> 00:35:08,707
LIAM: Divine Sense, which is specific to undead
location, not vague, if there's any within 60

383
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:10,167
feet. I'll use one.

384
00:35:10,167 --> 00:35:13,785
MATT: Okay. Focusing, no undead within 60 feet of
you.

385
00:35:13,785 --> 00:35:15,635
LAURA: That's good.

386
00:35:15,635 --> 00:35:20,644
SAM: I drank a tiny little potion of healing. I
healed six.

387
00:35:20,644 --> 00:35:21,981
MATT: Good job!

388
00:35:21,981 --> 00:35:25,234
LIAM: So it's leading up to a plateau?

389
00:35:25,234 --> 00:35:30,176
MATT: Yeah, it goes up about ten or so feet, 15
feet up, and then it leads to another plateau, and

390
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,540
you can't see beyond that.

391
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,971
LIAM: I'm going to scuttle up and look over.

392
00:35:33,971 --> 00:35:36,776
MATT: Okay. Are you stealthing? Roll a stealth
check.

393
00:35:36,776 --> 00:35:38,831
LAURA: Add ten to it!

394
00:35:38,831 --> 00:35:45,339
MATT: Vex, are you going with him or letting him
scout ahead?

395
00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:49,494
LAURA: I crawled up, but then, once he took off
again, then I stayed.

396
00:35:49,494 --> 00:35:51,808
MATT: Okay.

397
00:35:51,808 --> 00:35:53,265
LIAM: 41.

398
00:35:53,265 --> 00:35:54,771
MATT: 41. Okay, cool.

399
00:35:54,771 --> 00:35:56,240
TRAVIS: 41?

400
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,134
LIAM: This is old news, guys. This is old news.
This is what I get to do.

401
00:36:00,134 --> 00:36:01,967
TRAVIS: It seems new to me every time.

402
00:36:01,967 --> 00:36:06,743
MATT: All right. You ascend to the top of this
plateau. It only goes on for about 15 feet, and

403
00:36:06,743 --> 00:36:11,259
then descends down into another chamber that
splits in two different directions. A tunnel that

404
00:36:11,259 --> 00:36:16,516
goes to the right and to the left. You can see,
once again, the stalactites, some of them meeting

405
00:36:16,516 --> 00:36:21,404
in the center with the stalagmites to form
pillars. You can see portions of the wall that

406
00:36:21,404 --> 00:36:29,321
have collapsed and created these soft landslides
in one corner to the right of you. But currently,

407
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:33,479
all you see is the descending tunnel and then the
split, and you can't see too far

408
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:35,003
one way or the other.

409
00:36:35,003 --> 00:36:42,172
LIAM: Yeah. I turn around to group, and do like
a-- And then I go down over, stealthing along the way.

410
00:36:42,172 --> 00:36:45,237
MATT: Okay. Anyone else? What are you doing?

411
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:46,584
LAURA: I guess we follow.

412
00:36:46,584 --> 00:36:49,775
SAM: What did this mean? Did this mean we were
supposed to follow him and split up?

413
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:52,232
LAURA: I think that means that there's a split in
the path.

414
00:36:52,232 --> 00:36:54,843
SAM: Let's split up, anyway.

415
00:36:54,843 --> 00:36:58,049
LAURA: Scanlan, you go one way, and we'll go the
other.

416
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:04,947
MATT: Okay, so as the rest of you ascend to the
top of the plateau, you make your way down to the

417
00:37:04,947 --> 00:37:09,604
center, and you can see that the path goes to the
right and the left. Both seem fairly identical,

418
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:11,661
though they're traveling in opposite directions.

419
00:37:11,661 --> 00:37:16,893
TALIESIN: We entered in the left side of the
body?

420
00:37:16,893 --> 00:37:23,548
MATT: If you were to look at it straight on, like
it's facing you, it would be the right side.

421
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:25,554
LAURA: If it's facing us.

422
00:37:25,554 --> 00:37:26,770
MATT: Correct.

423
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,662
MARISHA: So our right, its left.

424
00:37:28,662 --> 00:37:31,294
LAURA: No. Its right, our left.

425
00:37:31,294 --> 00:37:33,570
TALIESIN: Looking at its butt.

426
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:36,122
MATT: If you're looking at its butt, to the
right.

427
00:37:36,122 --> 00:37:42,076
TALIESIN: All right, to the right leg. So if we
split, we probably want to keep to the core of it.

428
00:37:42,076 --> 00:37:45,926
MARISHA: So go left? To the left.

429
00:37:45,926 --> 00:37:49,800
SAM: That is a decision, sure.

430
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,181
TALIESIN: We'll check, obviously, for air
currents.

431
00:37:54,181 --> 00:38:05,845
MATT: At which point, there is what sounds like an
explosion of rock and dirt immediately to the left

432
00:38:05,845 --> 00:38:14,130
of Percival as two heavy, rock-like limbs reach
out, grab, and pull him against the wall as the

433
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:20,022
ceiling crumples over and collapses. He has now
vanished within the wall, and now leaving a pile

434
00:38:20,022 --> 00:38:22,442
of rock in his place.

435
00:38:22,442 --> 00:38:25,233
LAURA: Percy! Keyleth! Keyleth, dig him out!

436
00:38:25,233 --> 00:38:29,272
MATT: Darkness. And you're now restrained, and
there is no air.

437
00:38:29,272 --> 00:38:31,109
LAURA: I start clawing at the wall where he was.

438
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:35,737
MATT: You start clawing it. At this point, with
the alertness piqued up between you two and

439
00:38:35,737 --> 00:38:40,692
Keyleth, you glance around and you can see things
emerging out of the nearby walls. Like the rocks

440
00:38:40,692 --> 00:38:43,182
themselves are almost pushing through.

441
00:38:43,182 --> 00:38:51,005
MARISHA: I say, get to the middle, stay away from
the walls! And I cast Transmute Rock, right in the

442
00:38:51,005 --> 00:38:55,880
space where he went, and I reach my hands in and
try and grab him out of mud.

443
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,130
MATT: Okay.

444
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:00,150
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a 3rd-level spell.

445
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:05,217
TRAVIS: Have you ever transmuted anything before?

446
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:08,153
MARISHA: I've done it once before, and it didn't
work very well.

447
00:39:08,153 --> 00:39:15,103
MATT: So as you do that, this entire section of
the wall (squishing) turns to a heavy, soft mud

448
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:21,145
material, and your arms plunge into it, and you
feel, and you grab Percival, and pull him out.

449
00:39:21,145 --> 00:39:29,018
You're covered in thick, sludgy mud, and as he's
pulled out, you guys glance around and you can

450
00:39:29,018 --> 00:39:34,630
see, shifting in the darkness, the walls in
certain places seem to almost move. I need you all

451
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,528
to roll initiative.

452
00:39:37,528 --> 00:39:44,113
MARISHA: We're fighting walls! First doors, now
walls!

453
00:39:44,113 --> 00:39:50,805
SAM: Wow! We're already at a battle map!

454
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:59,938
TRAVIS: I know aquariums that don't look that
good.

455
00:39:59,938 --> 00:40:08,103
MATT: Percival, you're pulled into this side
there. Keyleth had just pulled you out there. Vex

456
00:40:08,103 --> 00:40:10,564
and Trinket.

457
00:40:10,564 --> 00:40:13,982
LAURA: I would be closer to Percy than Trinket
is.

458
00:40:13,982 --> 00:40:21,633
MATT: That's true. You were scrambling at the
wall, so that will be Trinket over there.

459
00:40:21,633 --> 00:40:28,308
LIAM: I was, as well. The twins were scrabbling at
the rock.

460
00:40:28,308 --> 00:40:35,536
MATT: All right. And that being the case, then,
you guys are all clustered up in that platform.

461
00:40:35,536 --> 00:40:37,046
LAURA: No!

462
00:40:37,046 --> 00:40:42,256
LIAM: Wait. Matt, wait.

463
00:40:42,256 --> 00:40:47,881
TRAVIS: (robotically) The walk sign is on.

464
00:40:47,881 --> 00:40:55,170
MATT: You watch as these creatures that are
similar to the living earth physicality of the

465
00:40:55,170 --> 00:41:00,328
titan and/or the elemental form that Keyleth has
taken in the past seem to emerge, but where their

466
00:41:00,328 --> 00:41:07,492
once glowing elemental eyes are, there's a vacuous
darkness. You feel the rumble of the ground as

467
00:41:07,492 --> 00:41:10,328
they shift and glide through the rock in their
vicinity.

468
00:41:10,328 --> 00:41:17,811
MARISHA: Oh, they're undead necromantic elemental
earth ellies?

469
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:21,270
MATT: They're not undead, because you do not sense
undead in the presence.

470
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:32,127
LAURA: Wait. Oh no! You guys, guess what we didn't
do? We didn't have a feast.

471
00:41:32,127 --> 00:41:39,746
SAM: Well, how were we going to have a feast? We
were in a big board meeting and then we came here.

472
00:41:39,746 --> 00:41:47,670
MATT: So getting initiative orders here. All
right, 25 to 20?

473
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,017
TALIESIN: 21.

474
00:41:49,017 --> 00:41:50,512
TRAVIS: Same thing.

475
00:41:50,512 --> 00:41:52,126
LAURA: 21 as well.

476
00:41:52,126 --> 00:42:04,588
MATT: Jeez. All right. 20 to 15?

477
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:05,754
LIAM: 19.

478
00:42:05,754 --> 00:42:07,138
SAM: 18!

479
00:42:07,138 --> 00:42:17,875
MATT: All right. 15 to ten? Ten to five?

480
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:19,513
MARISHA: Eight.

481
00:42:19,513 --> 00:42:21,964
LIAM: Pike rolled a one.

482
00:42:21,964 --> 00:42:30,312
MATT: Got it. Top of the round, Percival. As you
emerge, covered in the sludge, you look around

483
00:42:30,312 --> 00:42:36,755
you. By the way, right now, you have no vision
because nobody lit a torch. I should remember

484
00:42:36,755 --> 00:42:44,591
that. You are a human. You have no common sight.
We'll say for the purposes of this, you had a

485
00:42:44,591 --> 00:42:47,512
torch out, so you could see.

486
00:42:47,512 --> 00:42:49,964
TALIESIN: I might have been using my flashlight, I
would imagine.

487
00:42:49,964 --> 00:42:53,861
LIAM: Does Pike's Mace of Disruption always shed
bright light for 20 feet?

488
00:42:53,861 --> 00:43:01,109
MATT: When she chooses to. However, as soon as you
were pulled into the wall and then dragged back

489
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:05,737
out, and the whole surface of it is coated, you
were seeing darkness. In your turn, you are

490
00:43:05,737 --> 00:43:07,119
blinded right now.

491
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,320
TALIESIN: I'm blinded?

492
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,108
MATT: Yes, because you can't see anything around
you. All you hear is the moving and shifting of

493
00:43:11,108 --> 00:43:13,532
rock and your allies all preparing for some sort
of assault.

494
00:43:13,532 --> 00:43:21,120
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend my turn removing the
mud from my eyes, and I think I still have a

495
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,554
charge in my flashlight, at this point.

496
00:43:23,554 --> 00:43:26,848
MATT: You can't, though. It is covered in muck and
mud.

497
00:43:26,848 --> 00:43:29,803
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend my bonus action
clearing that and then--

498
00:43:29,803 --> 00:43:33,877
MATT: We'll say it'll take your whole turn to
clear yourself and to clear the light from that,

499
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:39,769
so there you go. At that point, the light at the
front of your weapon lights up, illuminates the

500
00:43:39,769 --> 00:43:44,892
vicinity, and you see the moving shadows are bits
of rock and stone, moving, living out of the

501
00:43:44,892 --> 00:43:46,388
nearby walls.

502
00:43:46,388 --> 00:43:48,479
LAURA: How do we fight rocks?

503
00:43:48,479 --> 00:43:54,737
MARISHA: I'm about to tell you. Be careful. They
can go into the walls and earth glide, so watch

504
00:43:54,737 --> 00:43:55,903
your feet.

505
00:43:55,903 --> 00:43:57,771
MATT: Percival, you can move if you want to.

506
00:43:57,771 --> 00:44:00,963
TALIESIN: Yeah. Is there one right next to me
right now?

507
00:44:00,963 --> 00:44:04,801
MATT: There's one maybe ten feet from you.

508
00:44:04,801 --> 00:44:10,017
TALIESIN: I'm going to hop over by the little pool
fountain. I'm going to back up and get out of this

509
00:44:10,017 --> 00:44:11,739
clump of people.

510
00:44:11,739 --> 00:44:15,376
LAURA: That sounded like you were casting a
spell.

511
00:44:15,376 --> 00:44:23,188
MARISHA: They're vulnerable to thunder damage,
anything vibrate-y, because rocks.

512
00:44:23,188 --> 00:44:32,256
MATT: Which you will find out-- I'll say that
you're yelling that as everyone is preparing. That

513
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:36,955
finishes Percival's turn. Grog, you're up.

514
00:44:36,955 --> 00:44:43,222
TRAVIS: I would like to rage. I would like to spin
around 180 degrees, and I would like to attack

515
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:46,683
Clayface right about there.

516
00:44:46,683 --> 00:44:49,200
MATT: Okay, go for it.

517
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,974
TRAVIS: Shit Stain is down at the bottom of the
stairs. Reckless!

518
00:44:52,974 --> 00:44:54,663
MATT: Go for it.

519
00:44:54,663 --> 00:45:01,400
SAM: Great Weapon Master! Assassinate! Uncanny
rage!

520
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,009
TRAVIS: 28.

521
00:45:03,009 --> 00:45:04,671
MATT: 28 hits.

522
00:45:04,671 --> 00:45:19,359
TRAVIS: Okay. Oh, I reroll ones and twos. Nice! 22
plus one point of necrotic. 23 points of damage.

523
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:23,589
MATT: 23 points of damage in the first hit. As you
spin around, jaw open, growling in rage (yells),

524
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:28,641
you bring the axe across, and it cuts across the
front of its chest. You watch as pieces of rock

525
00:45:28,641 --> 00:45:31,719
break off, and it still holds strong against the
impact.

526
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:32,898
TRAVIS: I do it again!

527
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:34,388
MATT: Go for it.

528
00:45:34,388 --> 00:45:41,872
TRAVIS: Reckless, Great Weapon Master this time!

529
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:43,254
25.

530
00:45:43,254 --> 00:45:44,749
MATT: 25 hits.

531
00:45:44,749 --> 00:45:51,581
TRAVIS: 31 points of damage.

532
00:45:51,581 --> 00:45:57,428
MATT: Nice! The second hit, you swing around and
slam it. It actually gets stuck and wedged in part

533
00:45:57,428 --> 00:46:05,930
of its body. The mouth opens and gives this
guttural (grunts) as a reaction. Actually giving a

534
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:10,467
pain exert upon the hit. However, as it reaches
out, both of its hands grab the edge of the axe.

535
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:12,888
All right. That end your turn?

536
00:46:12,888 --> 00:46:15,169
TRAVIS: Is he holding my axe?

537
00:46:15,169 --> 00:46:16,498
MATT: He's attempting to.

538
00:46:16,498 --> 00:46:18,074
TRAVIS: Well, I wanted to move!

539
00:46:18,074 --> 00:46:19,566
MATT: Okay, then move.

540
00:46:19,566 --> 00:46:29,449
TRAVIS: I'm moving! I would like to go (counting)
30 feet to face off with this guy.

541
00:46:29,449 --> 00:46:33,568
MATT: All right. Well, that guy swings at you with
his fist as you pull away. You rip the axe out of

542
00:46:33,568 --> 00:46:37,429
its grasp, and instead it takes one wide swing
with its right fist.

543
00:46:37,429 --> 00:46:40,391
LAURA: But you slice his fingers off when he does
it!

544
00:46:40,391 --> 00:46:48,458
MATT: He has advantage because you used reckless.
That is a 24 to hit.

545
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:59,547
TRAVIS: I have a low AC. I don't wear clothes. I
wear gauntlets and stuff. I wear skin. And tattoos.

546
00:46:59,547 --> 00:47:06,446
MATT: That is 18 points of bludgeoning damage,
reduced to nine. All right, that finish your turn,

547
00:47:06,446 --> 00:47:10,408
Grog? Vex, you're up. And you're on deck, Vax.

548
00:47:10,408 --> 00:47:13,356
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark.

549
00:47:13,356 --> 00:47:15,506
MATT: On?

550
00:47:15,506 --> 00:47:18,127
LAURA: On the biggest one. This one.

551
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:19,772
MATT: All right.

552
00:47:19,772 --> 00:47:24,077
LAURA: And then I'm going to shoot him. With
sharpshooter!

553
00:47:24,077 --> 00:47:25,998
MATT: Go for it!

554
00:47:25,998 --> 00:47:37,591
LAURA: Wait, okay. Oh no. 19 minus five. 14.

555
00:47:37,591 --> 00:47:42,398
MATT: 14 does not hit, unfortunately. As you mark
it with your spell, you pull back the first arrow,

556
00:47:42,398 --> 00:47:45,954
and it hits, but it ends up exploding, the shards
of wood scattering off of it, and your hear a

557
00:47:45,954 --> 00:47:47,866
slight (grunts).

558
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:54,395
LAURA: Yeah, you motherfucker. Okay. 16.

559
00:47:54,395 --> 00:48:00,279
MATT: 16 misses, just barely. You go to shoot
another arrow, this time out of frustration, as

560
00:48:00,279 --> 00:48:04,270
you pull back and let it loose, it actually
backhands the arrow out of the air, scattering the

561
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:06,169
shaft in the middle of the sky.

562
00:48:06,169 --> 00:48:12,655
LAURA: Wait, I didn't say sharpshooter! I didn't
say sharpshooter on that one, did I? I didn't clarify.

563
00:48:12,655 --> 00:48:15,717
MATT: So without the minus five, what would it
be?

564
00:48:15,717 --> 00:48:17,871
LAURA: It would be 21.

565
00:48:17,871 --> 00:48:20,384
MATT: Okay. You didn't say it.

566
00:48:20,384 --> 00:48:22,611
LAURA: I should've said it, but I didn't say it.

567
00:48:22,611 --> 00:48:28,168
MATT: That's okay, we'll let it go. Okay, so roll
damage. Regular damage. So as it goes to backhand

568
00:48:28,168 --> 00:48:33,140
it out of the air, the arrow manages to sink in
the center of its fist. It still causes a crack to

569
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:37,292
widen across the various plates that keep its left
arm together.

570
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:48,433
LAURA: 16 plus five lightning damage. And then,
since he is next to Scanlan, I get sneak attack?

571
00:48:48,433 --> 00:48:50,376
MATT: Correct.

572
00:48:50,376 --> 00:48:59,202
LAURA: Ooh, 12. 15 sneak attack! And then Hunter's
Mark, three.

573
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:06,411
MATT: All right. Fantastic. 39 damage in one hit.
So the second one, as it hits, it causes this rift

574
00:49:06,411 --> 00:49:12,509
in the center of its large, battering ram-like arm
to shift and crack and pieces of broken shale peel

575
00:49:12,509 --> 00:49:15,663
and fall off to the ground around it. Does that
end your turn?

576
00:49:15,663 --> 00:49:16,863
LAURA: Yeah.

577
00:49:16,863 --> 00:49:19,522
MATT: Do you want to move, or do you want to stay
where you are?

578
00:49:19,522 --> 00:49:20,819
LAURA: I'm going to stay where I am.

579
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:22,538
MATT: Vax, you're up.

580
00:49:22,538 --> 00:49:26,282
LIAM: We've been in here under an hour. Probably
not much time left, but under an hour, right?

581
00:49:26,282 --> 00:49:27,746
Since we arrived?

582
00:49:27,746 --> 00:49:29,575
MATT: Pushing close to an hour.

583
00:49:29,575 --> 00:49:32,130
LIAM: Okay. How high is the ceiling in this
tunnel?

584
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:33,345
MATT: About 12 feet.

585
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:38,211
LIAM: 12 feet. I will float above everybody, in
the space above their heads. We can fudge it.

586
00:49:38,211 --> 00:49:50,981
Probably between Percy and Pike, if we can manage
it. And I'm going to dagger, dagger, dagger, with

587
00:49:50,981 --> 00:49:55,064
sharpshooter on all three, the one right below me
next to Keyleth.

588
00:49:55,064 --> 00:49:56,783
MATT: All righty.

589
00:49:56,783 --> 00:50:01,460
LIAM: Okay. The first one is a 20.

590
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,823
MATT: All right, that hits.

591
00:50:03,823 --> 00:50:16,133
LIAM: Okay. Second one is balls. And the third one
is... 20.

592
00:50:16,133 --> 00:50:17,863
MATT: 20 hits.

593
00:50:17,863 --> 00:50:23,973
LIAM: And because assassin and they haven't gone
yet-- oh, I have advantage because of assassin, so

594
00:50:23,973 --> 00:50:37,848
sneak attack. Also next to Keyleth. Multiple
reasons for sneak attack, so that is 11, plus

595
00:50:37,848 --> 00:50:56,755
psychic damage is 15. (counting) 36 for the first
one. And then the last one does a rinky-dink one.

596
00:50:56,755 --> 00:50:59,447
MATT: One point of damage.

597
00:50:59,447 --> 00:51:02,332
LIAM: Because off-hand attack doesn't get any--

598
00:51:02,332 --> 00:51:04,673
MATT: There's no modifier, just whatever damage
the weapon would deal.

599
00:51:04,673 --> 00:51:06,447
LIAM: Yeah, just one.

600
00:51:06,447 --> 00:51:07,580
MATT: Okay.

601
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,355
LIAM: And I'll stay floating.

602
00:51:09,355 --> 00:51:11,706
MATT: All right. So as you're flying there, your
wings still--

603
00:51:11,706 --> 00:51:13,708
LAURA: Don't you add six, though?

604
00:51:13,708 --> 00:51:16,716
LIAM: No modifier. That's the modifier.

605
00:51:16,716 --> 00:51:20,919
MATT: No dexterity modifier. It still gets weapon
bonus, damage bonus on the weapon.

606
00:51:20,919 --> 00:51:30,009
LIAM: That's calculated from dexterity. Oh, so
two. And 20 more for the sharpshooter.

607
00:51:30,009 --> 00:51:39,268
MATT: Ah, didn't add sharpshooter onto that. Keep
that in mind. As you release the torrent of

608
00:51:39,268 --> 00:51:44,925
daggers down, one of them slams into the chest as
another hits and skids off to the side and

609
00:51:44,925 --> 00:51:48,927
vanishes, and the third one actually strikes right
where the first dagger was, driving it deeper in.

610
00:51:48,927 --> 00:51:52,767
Both of them seem to wedge and break the interior
of its chest, and you watch as parts of its body

611
00:51:52,767 --> 00:51:56,772
are falling off in chunks. It's giving this
horrible sucking sound, like it's barely holding

612
00:51:56,772 --> 00:52:02,280
itself together. (wheezes) But there it still
stands. That ends your turn. Scanlan, you're up.

613
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:09,482
SAM: Okay, I will rotate around the guy with the
red ring around him so that I'm between him and

614
00:52:09,482 --> 00:52:11,029
his friend.

615
00:52:11,029 --> 00:52:15,453
MATT: Right there, you mean? Okay, you're right on
the edge. There's a platform drop-off behind you.

616
00:52:15,453 --> 00:52:17,066
SAM: (singing) I'm living on the edge!

617
00:52:17,066 --> 00:52:19,446
(laughter)

618
00:52:19,446 --> 00:52:21,878
MATT: As you rush over there, you're like
(grunts). You watch as a couple rocks tumble off

619
00:52:21,878 --> 00:52:25,008
and clatter below. Ten-foot drop; not too bad.

620
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:31,724
SAM: Sure. Oh. I'll inspire Grog first. Because
I'm about to hit you.

621
00:52:31,724 --> 00:52:32,795
TRAVIS: Okay.

622
00:52:32,795 --> 00:52:34,961
(laughter)

623
00:52:34,961 --> 00:52:41,827
SAM: I will sing, (singing) Hey now! You're a
Grog-star. Get your axe up and slay! Hey now!

624
00:52:41,827 --> 00:52:53,533
You're a Grog-star. Get your rage on and rage! All
Laura's dice are gold. Now a d12 can be rolled.

625
00:52:53,533 --> 00:52:57,742
TRAVIS: Pulled that shit out at the last minute.

626
00:52:57,742 --> 00:53:01,127
MATT: It came back around. All right, so take your
inspiration dice, definitely.

627
00:53:01,127 --> 00:53:06,612
SAM: And then I'll do a 3rd-level Thunderwave.

628
00:53:06,612 --> 00:53:12,134
MATT: Towards which one?

629
00:53:12,134 --> 00:53:20,195
SAM: Both. It's 15 feet from me. Yeah, it's from
me in a 15-foot cube.

630
00:53:20,195 --> 00:53:25,333
MATT: A cube? Okay, so you can put yourself in the
cube, then. Okay.

631
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:27,606
TALIESIN: You may not even hit Grog, necessarily.

632
00:53:27,606 --> 00:53:29,226
TRAVIS: You'd better.

633
00:53:29,226 --> 00:53:32,894
MATT: You can do it where it doesn't hit Grog. It
just hits the other guy.

634
00:53:32,894 --> 00:53:34,322
SAM: That'll be nice!

635
00:53:34,322 --> 00:53:38,860
MATT: I'll let you do that. Out the sides of you.
All right, so that's a constitution saving throw

636
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:40,251
for both of them, right?

637
00:53:40,251 --> 00:53:42,534
SAM: Yeah, sure. Oh shit. Yeah.

638
00:53:42,534 --> 00:53:48,613
MATT: Second one does save. First one does not.
Rolled a natural 20 on its saving throw. The first

639
00:53:48,613 --> 00:53:50,129
one rolled a five.

640
00:53:50,129 --> 00:53:52,667
SAM: What did the second one roll?

641
00:53:52,667 --> 00:53:53,948
MATT: Natural 20.

642
00:53:53,948 --> 00:54:04,606
SAM: Oh fuck. Okay, that does. They both take 4d8
damage, and the one who didn't make his save gets

643
00:54:04,606 --> 00:54:06,819
pushed away, but he's right up against the wall.

644
00:54:06,819 --> 00:54:10,545
MATT: So it doesn't do anything. However, it does
thunder damage, which they are vulnerable to, so

645
00:54:10,545 --> 00:54:11,949
they take double damage from this.

646
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:13,571
SAM: Double damage?!

647
00:54:13,571 --> 00:54:17,944
MATT: You watch as the blast of thunder energy
slams outward. Both of them, you watch as their

648
00:54:17,944 --> 00:54:21,184
bodies are thrown into the rock behind them.

649
00:54:21,184 --> 00:54:29,228
SAM: Terrible! 12 points.

650
00:54:29,228 --> 00:54:35,660
TALIESIN: That was subpar.

651
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:40,242
MATT: That's okay. Both of them get hit and thrown
back, slam into the wall, and you watch as their

652
00:54:40,242 --> 00:54:45,156
body is unable to earthglide based on the force of
the impact, so it actually causes part of their

653
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:49,945
body to crack intrinsically. And they both fall
back to the ground, and their feet sink into the

654
00:54:49,945 --> 00:54:56,847
stone about an inch or two. And they reposition
their stance. All right. Anything else you want to do?

655
00:54:56,847 --> 00:55:02,996
SAM: Oh shit, if I move away, he's going to take a
swing at me, isn't he? But that would be wise.

656
00:55:02,996 --> 00:55:04,548
MATT: Your call.

657
00:55:04,548 --> 00:55:08,497
SAM: No, I'll shelter in place.

658
00:55:08,497 --> 00:55:12,523
MATT: Okay. Now it's their turn.

659
00:55:12,523 --> 00:55:17,194
TRAVIS: They're going to come out asking for help,
because they've been--

660
00:55:17,194 --> 00:55:20,387
MARISHA: We've been stuck in his digestive tract!

661
00:55:20,387 --> 00:55:24,822
TRAVIS: And we're slaughtering them! We weren't
going to even say anything or do anything to you guys!

662
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:33,013
MATT: First off, I need Keyleth, Vex, and Percival
to make a dexterity saving throw, please.

663
00:55:33,013 --> 00:55:35,780
LAURA: Natural 20!

664
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:37,136
MATT: Nice.

665
00:55:37,136 --> 00:55:41,832
MARISHA: That was so close to being a natural 20!

666
00:55:41,832 --> 00:55:44,030
TALIESIN: Not natural 20, but a 20 nonetheless.

667
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:49,411
MATT: Okay. What did you get?

668
00:55:49,411 --> 00:55:51,769
MARISHA: 12.

669
00:55:51,769 --> 00:55:56,506
MATT: All right.

670
00:55:56,506 --> 00:55:59,541
LIAM: What, you're sucked in the ground? No!

671
00:55:59,541 --> 00:56:02,675
LAURA: The ground raised up?

672
00:56:02,675 --> 00:56:06,169
MARISHA: Did they turn us to stone? What did they
do?

673
00:56:06,169 --> 00:56:12,619
MATT: No. Keyleth, you all of a sudden watch as
the one behind you that is barely holding on

674
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:20,208
angrily goes (impact) slams its fist into the
ground. And from the sudden vibration, the earth

675
00:56:20,208 --> 00:56:26,456
seems to rise up underneath and attempt to
swallow you. Vex and Percival, you both grab each

676
00:56:26,456 --> 00:56:30,618
other's hands and leap into the air, and it passes
under your feet. However, Keyleth is not fast

677
00:56:30,618 --> 00:56:36,645
enough and gets swallowed as it closes up (crash)
around her, and now there's a giant pile of earth

678
00:56:36,645 --> 00:56:41,619
and rock where Keyleth is buried within and
restrained. You both manage to move out of the way.

679
00:56:41,619 --> 00:56:43,995
LIAM: Yeah. Vax sees that and is not worried.

680
00:56:43,995 --> 00:56:46,437
(laughter)

681
00:56:46,437 --> 00:56:48,954
LAURA: She's fine.

682
00:56:48,954 --> 00:56:55,737
MATT: These guys are going to move up there. And
this guy's going to move up here. This guy's going

683
00:56:55,737 --> 00:57:02,878
to attempt to pummel the shit out of Scanlan. He's
going to make two slam attacks against you. That

684
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:05,323
is a 20 and a 21.

685
00:57:05,323 --> 00:57:07,043
SAM: Yeah.

686
00:57:07,043 --> 00:57:20,360
MATT: You take 16 points of bludgeoning damage and
17 points of bludgeoning damage. And you watch as

687
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:28,769
it slips into the wall and vanishes. You can make
an attack of opportunity against it. However, I am

688
00:57:28,769 --> 00:57:34,814
giving it three-quarters cover, as it pulls just
out of melee range and is mostly in the wall, so

689
00:57:34,814 --> 00:57:36,441
it gets plus five to armor class.

690
00:57:36,441 --> 00:57:44,435
SAM: I will swing my sword at it with advantage,
because I just inspired someone, and Mythcarver

691
00:57:44,435 --> 00:57:48,553
has that feature. The first one was better. 17
plus ten!

692
00:57:48,553 --> 00:57:51,884
MATT: That actually hits! Go ahead and roll
damage.

693
00:57:51,884 --> 00:57:55,144
TRAVIS: Mythcarver gets you some action once every
two years.

694
00:57:55,144 --> 00:58:07,699
SAM: I actually don't know. It says it's a
plus-three longsword. Does that mean it's 1d8 plus three?

695
00:58:07,699 --> 00:58:11,546
MATT: 1d8 plus three plus your strength modifier.

696
00:58:11,546 --> 00:58:23,454
SAM: So it's 1d8 plus four. And then I rolled a
one, so that's five. But it also says, somewhere

697
00:58:23,454 --> 00:58:31,439
in here, deals an additional 1d6 force damage! Oh
yeah! One.

698
00:58:31,439 --> 00:58:40,660
MATT: Hey, six free points of damage! It
vanishes somewhere inside the wall. You're not

699
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:49,656
entirely sure where. Two attacks on you, Percival.
That is a 28 and a 19.

700
00:58:49,656 --> 00:58:50,948
TALIESIN: Yeah.

701
00:58:50,948 --> 00:58:55,733
LIAM: Dang, Perce.

702
00:58:55,733 --> 00:58:57,137
MATT: 16 points of bludgeoning damage.

703
00:58:57,137 --> 00:58:58,489
TALIESIN: 16?

704
00:58:58,489 --> 00:59:01,243
MATT: Yep. And 15 points of bludgeoning damage.

705
00:59:01,243 --> 00:59:05,886
SAM: Shit! On a retreating enemy, I get to cast a
spell.

706
00:59:05,886 --> 00:59:14,688
MATT: War caster. Well, next time. That's against
you and against Vex. That is a 22?

707
00:59:14,688 --> 00:59:19,546
LAURA: Oh wait, that's Pike. Hold on. Yes, it hits
me.

708
00:59:19,546 --> 00:59:20,862
MATT: And 21.

709
00:59:20,862 --> 00:59:22,358
LAURA: My armor class is 21.

710
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:30,294
MATT: So it still hits you, all right. You take 14
points of bludgeoning damage, and another 14

711
00:59:30,294 --> 00:59:34,285
points of bludgeoning damage. And then both of
these guys--

712
00:59:34,285 --> 00:59:36,865
TALIESIN: Do we get an attack of opportunity?

713
00:59:36,865 --> 00:59:40,549
MATT: You do. With a plus five to AC as this guy
sinks into the ground.

714
00:59:40,549 --> 00:59:43,424
LAURA: Can we shoot him with an arrow as he
sinks into the ground?

715
00:59:43,424 --> 00:59:44,871
MATT: No, it's a melee attack.

716
00:59:44,871 --> 00:59:46,442
TALIESIN: So I'm going to take a swing.

717
00:59:46,442 --> 00:59:48,233
MATT: All right.

718
00:59:48,233 --> 00:59:54,746
TALIESIN: That hits. Actually, I crit only with my
guns on a 19, right? I don't crit with my sword?

719
00:59:54,746 --> 01:00:05,524
MATT: I'm pretty sure you crit on a 19 or 20
regardless, but the hemorrhaging shot element

720
01:00:05,524 --> 01:00:06,791
doesn't happen.

721
01:00:06,791 --> 01:00:09,118
TALIESIN: The hemorrhaging shot obviously doesn't
happen even though it's a natural-- That's fine.

722
01:00:09,118 --> 01:00:21,431
I crit, so that's a ridiculous thing to
hit. 32 to hit.

723
01:00:21,431 --> 01:00:22,788
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

724
01:00:22,788 --> 01:00:25,447
TALIESIN: So that's a 1d8.

725
01:00:25,447 --> 01:00:27,324
TRAVIS: You never know, that guy could be
made out of concrete.

726
01:00:27,324 --> 01:00:35,691
TALIESIN: Two plus seven, and it's silvered, if
that matters. That's 16 points of piercing damage.

727
01:00:35,691 --> 01:00:42,875
MATT: All right, cool. So you strike out as it
disappears into the wall and vanishes. This guy

728
01:00:42,875 --> 01:00:44,943
here shifts into the wall as well.

729
01:00:44,943 --> 01:00:46,183
LIAM: He vanished?

730
01:00:46,183 --> 01:00:47,798
MATT: Well, he (sucking sound) into the wall.

731
01:00:47,798 --> 01:00:48,877
LAURA: They're all vanishing!

732
01:00:48,877 --> 01:00:50,083
TRAVIS: Well, not this guy, they're still
walking.

733
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:52,585
MATT: And the guy who's right there is going to
take two strikes at you, Grog.

734
01:00:52,585 --> 01:00:57,731
TRAVIS: Oh, bring it. They both hit. They're
reckless.

735
01:00:57,731 --> 01:01:08,263
MATT: Yep. Yep. And the other attack-- Yep, both
hit. So that's 16 points of bludgeoning damage,

736
01:01:08,263 --> 01:01:14,014
reduced to eight. And 12 points of bludgeoning
damage, reduced to six.

737
01:01:14,014 --> 01:01:16,371
TRAVIS: Six. Can I take my retaliation strike
against him?

738
01:01:16,371 --> 01:01:17,648
MATT: You can.

739
01:01:17,648 --> 01:01:22,163
TRAVIS: Lovely. Reckless, Great Weapon Master.
Come on. Natural 20!

740
01:01:22,163 --> 01:01:25,461
MATT: Oh, that's going to suck!

741
01:01:25,461 --> 01:01:31,449
LAURA: Squish him! Make a building out of him! I
don't know.

742
01:01:31,449 --> 01:01:36,028
TRAVIS: Oh! I reroll ones and twos! Great. 11,
that's better.

743
01:01:36,028 --> 01:01:41,399
TALIESIN: You get all sorts of bonuses to that
crit.

744
01:01:41,399 --> 01:01:45,936
TRAVIS: 36, 42--

745
01:01:45,936 --> 01:01:48,365
LAURA: Now I've got David Bowie in my head.

746
01:01:48,365 --> 01:01:50,105
TRAVIS: 48.

747
01:01:50,105 --> 01:01:52,451
MATT: 48 points of damage.

748
01:01:52,451 --> 01:01:57,794
TRAVIS: Oh, necrotic. 52.

749
01:01:57,794 --> 01:02:00,895
TALIESIN: Is that doubled? And you doubled
everything into your extra crit--

750
01:02:00,895 --> 01:02:02,864
TRAVIS: I've been practicing.

751
01:02:02,864 --> 01:02:09,399
MATT: As it slams with both fists into you, with
one giant (whoosh) over the head as it impacts

752
01:02:09,399 --> 01:02:14,734
you, you grab with one hand the back of its fist
and grin, and then bring the axe straight up into

753
01:02:14,734 --> 01:02:20,086
its torso with one hand. It strikes and splits
open part of its rock chest and you hear this

754
01:02:20,086 --> 01:02:27,548
(guttural wheeze) which it reforms again. But
still, it's taken the brunt of the impact, and

755
01:02:27,548 --> 01:02:33,068
it's now going to shift into the wall, which you
can't attack because you already used your

756
01:02:33,068 --> 01:02:38,107
reaction. That ends their turn. Keyleth, you're
up. You're currently buried. You're blinded.

757
01:02:38,107 --> 01:02:46,517
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to concentrate for a
second, and then go earth elemental.

758
01:02:46,517 --> 01:02:52,630
(thud) And now that I'm earth elemental, I have
tremor sense. Can I sense where these other

759
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:54,041
motherfuckers are?

760
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:56,926
MATT: You can feel where they are, yeah. You can
sense them moving through the ground.

761
01:02:56,926 --> 01:03:01,425
SAM: Oh shit. Everybody dies.

762
01:03:01,425 --> 01:03:05,204
MARISHA: But I want to be underground. I'm there,
but I'm still underground right now.

763
01:03:05,204 --> 01:03:06,630
MATT: Right. I'm marking your place.

764
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:07,516
MARISHA: Yeah.

765
01:03:07,516 --> 01:03:09,527
TALIESIN: (singing) Underground!

766
01:03:09,527 --> 01:03:14,689
MARISHA: (singing) Put on your earthglide shoes
and dance! (speaking) Okay, I want to go right

767
01:03:14,689 --> 01:03:23,124
in the center of as many of them as I can hit and
take a cue from Scanlan and do a Thunderwave

768
01:03:23,124 --> 01:03:24,837
underground.

769
01:03:24,837 --> 01:03:27,422
MATT: As your earth elemental? Because you have--

770
01:03:27,422 --> 01:03:30,553
MARISHA: Because I can cast in Wild Shape now.

771
01:03:30,553 --> 01:03:34,914
SAM: He's going to the phone. He's checking his
texts.

772
01:03:34,914 --> 01:03:39,061
TRAVIS: So if they're healing when we hit them, do
we think they're healing when they go back into

773
01:03:39,061 --> 01:03:40,216
the wall?

774
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:41,748
TALIESIN: Probably.

775
01:03:41,748 --> 01:03:50,291
MATT: Let me see here real fast. What are the
components of Thunderwave?

776
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:52,831
SAM: I will look for you!

777
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:56,476
MATT: Thunderwave is verbal and somatic. Right?

778
01:03:56,476 --> 01:03:58,365
SAM: V, S!

779
01:03:58,365 --> 01:03:59,878
MATT: Correct.

780
01:03:59,878 --> 01:04:02,369
TRAVIS: Dude, that is a badass.

781
01:04:02,369 --> 01:04:06,600
MATT: Just making sure, because there is a slight
limitation to druid spellcasting in beast form.

782
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,201
You're probably still good. Let me see.

783
01:04:08,201 --> 01:04:11,748
MARISHA: Not using material components, you mean?

784
01:04:11,748 --> 01:04:13,483
LAURA: He got bigger?

785
01:04:13,483 --> 01:04:16,765
MARISHA: No, that's me. That's me, baby, that's
me.

786
01:04:16,765 --> 01:04:18,376
LIAM: Should've seen the green.

787
01:04:18,376 --> 01:04:21,078
MATT: Yeah, verbal and somatic, so you can do
that.

788
01:04:21,078 --> 01:04:22,574
TALIESIN: Yeah!

789
01:04:22,574 --> 01:04:24,344
MARISHA: I'm going to do it 3rd-level, too.

790
01:04:24,344 --> 01:04:29,057
MATT: 15-foot cube, the most guys you can hit
would probably be these two here, clustered

791
01:04:29,057 --> 01:04:31,970
together. Otherwise, everyone else is just a one
hit. They're too far spread out.

792
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:34,286
MARISHA: It's a 15-foot radius from you.

793
01:04:34,286 --> 01:04:39,286
MATT: It's a 15-foot cube originating from you.
Meaning it's not a radial thing.

794
01:04:39,286 --> 01:04:44,827
MARISHA: Oh, like a (explosion noise). Oh, cool!
Got it. Then I'll take those two dudes.

795
01:04:44,827 --> 01:04:48,626
LIAM: So that's why Vax's feathers were prickling
the other time.

796
01:04:48,626 --> 01:04:52,462
MATT: So you shift through over here, beneath the
ground.

797
01:04:52,462 --> 01:04:54,464
LAURA: That's so cool.

798
01:04:54,464 --> 01:04:56,853
MARISHA: (thudding noises) Underground!

799
01:04:56,853 --> 01:04:59,088
LAURA: Look how much bigger she is than those
fucks!

800
01:04:59,088 --> 01:05:02,322
MARISHA: That's not a great roll, but it'll do.

801
01:05:02,322 --> 01:05:04,487
SAM: Do you get to reroll ones?

802
01:05:04,487 --> 01:05:06,835
MARISHA: Ones and twos.

803
01:05:06,835 --> 01:05:13,830
MATT: That's a 13 and a 17. So neither of them
make their save.

804
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:20,924
MARISHA: So that is 16 times two, so 32 damage to
both of them.

805
01:05:20,924 --> 01:05:23,563
MATT: 32 points of damage to both of them.

806
01:05:23,563 --> 01:05:25,200
SAM: Did they make saves?

807
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,437
MARISHA: No.

808
01:05:26,437 --> 01:05:28,146
SAM: So they get pushed as well.

809
01:05:28,146 --> 01:05:30,088
MARISHA: And they also get pushed ten feet. Yeah.

810
01:05:30,088 --> 01:05:33,948
MATT: Well, they'd get pushed if they weren't in
the middle of the rock. They glide on their own.

811
01:05:33,948 --> 01:05:35,335
They stay put.

812
01:05:35,335 --> 01:05:36,612
MARISHA: Sure.

813
01:05:36,612 --> 01:05:47,592
MATT: All right. So as you (whoosh) outward, you
send the shockwave, and you guys hear this loud,

814
01:05:47,592 --> 01:05:53,013
thunderous (explosive thrum) beneath the ground.
And you watch as rock and dirt is thrown from this

815
01:05:53,013 --> 01:05:58,071
wall. Poor Trinket is spattered with rock and dirt
and spins around (bear growling).

816
01:05:58,071 --> 01:06:00,262
LAURA: Aw, buddy! You're okay!

817
01:06:00,262 --> 01:06:05,063
MATT: That wall is not looking very sturdy right
now. The Thunderwave has structurally damaged this

818
01:06:05,063 --> 01:06:06,853
whole portion of the cavern right now.

819
01:06:06,853 --> 01:06:08,419
TRAVIS: Thanks, Keyleth.

820
01:06:08,419 --> 01:06:11,013
MARISHA: This whole thing was coming apart!

821
01:06:11,013 --> 01:06:14,879
MATT: That ends Keyleth's turn. Pike's up.

822
01:06:14,879 --> 01:06:20,343
LIAM: What about between Grog and Scanlan? That
way if one of them comes up by either of them,

823
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:21,468
she's there.

824
01:06:21,468 --> 01:06:23,301
MARISHA: Get Trinket away from that wall.

825
01:06:23,301 --> 01:06:29,804
LAURA: Well, I would, if it was Trinket's turn.
Pike's going to run down and stand between Scanlan

826
01:06:29,804 --> 01:06:30,940
and Grog.

827
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:32,279
MATT: All right.

828
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:33,725
LAURA: "Oh, Grog!"

829
01:06:33,725 --> 01:06:36,247
LIAM: Punch the mace and light that shit up.

830
01:06:36,247 --> 01:06:37,373
LAURA: Yeah.

831
01:06:37,373 --> 01:06:39,314
LIAM: Blow hair out of her face.

832
01:06:39,314 --> 01:06:41,415
MATT: Yeah, so she makes this beacon of light.

833
01:06:41,415 --> 01:06:44,807
LAURA: And then she's going to hold her action
until a thing appears.

834
01:06:44,807 --> 01:06:46,325
MATT: What is she holding?

835
01:06:46,325 --> 01:06:47,474
LAURA: Attacking.

836
01:06:47,474 --> 01:06:51,882
MATT: A physical attack? So as soon as one
appears, she's going to go ahead and swing. Okay,

837
01:06:51,882 --> 01:06:54,710
good. So she's holding that. That ends Pike's
turn. Top of the round: Percival, you're up.

838
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,290
TALIESIN: I'm going to--

839
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:58,221
SAM: (whispers) No bonus action?

840
01:06:58,221 --> 01:07:04,138
TALIESIN: What? Well, I'm going to use my bonus
action. Since there's nothing to attack at the

841
01:07:04,138 --> 01:07:10,220
moment, I'm going to move slightly to the other
end of that little precipice that I'm on, over

842
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:11,608
where Keyleth disappeared.

843
01:07:11,608 --> 01:07:12,676
MATT: Oh, over this side?

844
01:07:12,676 --> 01:07:16,404
TALIESIN: Yeah, get away from things. I'm going to
use my bonus action to do a heal.

845
01:07:16,404 --> 01:07:20,911
MATT: You guys traveled this way, and this is
where you saw the right and left split.

846
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:22,296
LAURA: Oh, right.

847
01:07:22,296 --> 01:07:29,747
TALIESIN: That was embarrassing. So that's 11
points of damage. That's great. And then I'm going

848
01:07:29,747 --> 01:07:32,989
to hold my attack until something approaches.

849
01:07:32,989 --> 01:07:37,465
MATT: Okay. So you get your weapon ready. You're
holding it for any sort of movement out of a wall.

850
01:07:37,465 --> 01:07:38,569
Got it.

851
01:07:38,569 --> 01:07:39,950
TALIESIN: Yeah. Gun in one hand, sword in the
other.

852
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:41,300
MATT: All right, got it. Grog, you're up.

853
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:43,278
SAM: Why don't we just leave? There's no one
here.

854
01:07:43,278 --> 01:07:45,489
TRAVIS: I know, that's what I'm doing. So there's
no enemies in sight?

855
01:07:45,489 --> 01:07:46,823
MATT: Currently, no.

856
01:07:46,823 --> 01:07:51,342
TRAVIS: Ah! Can I run as far as I can this way?

857
01:07:51,342 --> 01:07:52,509
MATT: Yep.

858
01:07:52,509 --> 01:07:55,141
TRAVIS: Is that like five, ten, 15, 20--

859
01:07:55,141 --> 01:08:03,871
MATT: 50 is what you can get, right there.

860
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:05,134
TRAVIS: I'll take it.

861
01:08:05,134 --> 01:08:06,434
MATT: All right, so that's your movement.

862
01:08:06,434 --> 01:08:11,422
TRAVIS: Yep. I'm going to hold my attack until
something stupid shows me its face.

863
01:08:11,422 --> 01:08:17,057
MATT: Okay, good to know. That ends your turn.
Vex.

864
01:08:17,057 --> 01:08:24,776
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to call Trinket away from
the wall, so he's going to run down next to Grog.

865
01:08:24,776 --> 01:08:26,556
MATT: Okay.

866
01:08:26,556 --> 01:08:31,843
LAURA: And then I'm going to kick off and get on
my broom, so I'm off the ground.

867
01:08:31,843 --> 01:08:35,717
MATT: Okay, so you get up, and you're now lifted
up into the air a bit.

868
01:08:35,717 --> 01:08:38,061
MARISHA: You're still blind?

869
01:08:38,061 --> 01:08:41,271
TALIESIN: No, I can see. We've got two light
sources now.

870
01:08:41,271 --> 01:08:42,728
MARISHA: Okay.

871
01:08:42,728 --> 01:08:44,571
TRAVIS: (singing) I believe I can--

872
01:08:44,571 --> 01:08:46,593
MATT: You believe you can what?

873
01:08:46,593 --> 01:08:47,713
TRAVIS: Fly?

874
01:08:47,713 --> 01:08:50,011
LIAM: (singing) Fucking die.

875
01:08:50,011 --> 01:08:53,195
TRAVIS: (singing) I believe I can touch--
(speaking) What does he touch?

876
01:08:53,195 --> 01:08:54,458
SAM: The sky?

877
01:08:54,458 --> 01:08:58,560
TRAVIS: The sky. (singing) I think about it
every--

878
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,861
MATT: Don't hurt yourself.

879
01:09:00,861 --> 01:09:04,343
TRAVIS: I'm never singing in character.

880
01:09:04,343 --> 01:09:08,048
LAURA: Don't speak!

881
01:09:08,048 --> 01:09:10,690
TRAVIS: (singing) I know just what you're saying!

882
01:09:10,690 --> 01:09:12,645
LAURA: How high is the ceiling in here?

883
01:09:12,645 --> 01:09:15,160
LIAM: About 20 feet.

884
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,384
MATT: You are right up against this ceiling. It's
about 12 to 15 feet.

885
01:09:17,384 --> 01:09:20,411
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to want to hover right in
the middle. I don't want to be high up. I want to

886
01:09:20,411 --> 01:09:22,527
be right between the ceiling and the floor.

887
01:09:22,527 --> 01:09:24,570
MATT: Okay. So you're about a head's height up.

888
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:30,880
LAURA: Yeah. (Southern accent) And I'm going to
hold my action until I can see one of those things.

889
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,355
MATT: Arrow's notched, ready to fire?

890
01:09:32,355 --> 01:09:33,331
LAURA: Uh-huh.

891
01:09:33,331 --> 01:09:34,917
MATT: Okay. That brings us to Vax.

892
01:09:34,917 --> 01:09:42,889
LIAM: Can I move ten feet closer to Scanlan,
and do the classic Van Damme movement and stand

893
01:09:42,889 --> 01:09:47,348
between stalactites in the ceiling and hide with
my bonus action.

894
01:09:47,348 --> 01:09:48,264
MATT: Right here?

895
01:09:48,264 --> 01:09:49,740
LIAM: Yeah, and hide in the ceiling.

896
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:50,550
MARISHA: What?

897
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:51,785
TRAVIS: You going to Time Cop that shit?

898
01:09:51,785 --> 01:09:52,825
MARISHA: That's awesome!

899
01:09:52,825 --> 01:09:54,287
SAM: Are you doing the splits, right now, are your
legs--?

900
01:09:54,287 --> 01:09:58,356
LIAM: Nah, I'm just using my feet for that. No, my
hands are occupied. With my feet, yeah.

901
01:09:58,356 --> 01:10:00,152
MATT: Make a stealth check.

902
01:10:00,152 --> 01:10:01,777
LIAM: Stealth check. Yeah, baby.

903
01:10:01,777 --> 01:10:03,286
TALIESIN: Make a splits check.

904
01:10:03,286 --> 01:10:06,548
LIAM: Ten. Do I still have sneaky sneak from you?

905
01:10:06,548 --> 01:10:09,186
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace is still-- Oh, no. No,
I Hunter's Marked.

906
01:10:09,186 --> 01:10:12,100
LIAM: That's fine. Pike, get out of the way!

907
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:14,474
TRAVIS: Don't you talk to her like that!

908
01:10:14,474 --> 01:10:18,722
LIAM: 27. And I'll hold my attack action.

909
01:10:18,722 --> 01:10:20,659
MATT: Okay. Scanlan.

910
01:10:20,659 --> 01:10:23,152
SAM: We're all holding our shit?

911
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:27,903
LAURA: The minute something shows, we're all going
to be like, boom! But nothing's going to show.

912
01:10:27,903 --> 01:10:33,424
SAM: Nothing's going to show? Which way were we
going when all this shit happened?

913
01:10:33,424 --> 01:10:36,322
MATT: You were traveling this way, and this was
the split in the path ahead.

914
01:10:36,322 --> 01:10:38,191
TALIESIN: So we're heading left?

915
01:10:38,191 --> 01:10:40,436
SAM: Should we be trying to get out of here?

916
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:41,512
TRAVIS: Yeah.

917
01:10:41,512 --> 01:10:43,082
TALIESIN: Let's get out of here. We don't need
this.

918
01:10:43,082 --> 01:10:44,873
TRAVIS: By the way, we're supposed to go to the
left.

919
01:10:44,873 --> 01:10:46,719
LAURA: Thanks, Grog.

920
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:48,157
LIAM: Oh, yeah. That's right.

921
01:10:48,157 --> 01:10:50,070
TALIESIN: I would've made a run if I had been
thinking about it.

922
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:51,471
TRAVIS: What's right? The left?

923
01:10:51,471 --> 01:10:52,696
LIAM: Right.

924
01:10:52,696 --> 01:11:01,492
SAM: I will go 25 feet the same direction Grog
went in, because that's all I can run.

925
01:11:01,492 --> 01:11:04,138
MATT: 25. That will get you up here next to
Percival.

926
01:11:04,138 --> 01:11:05,834
LAURA: Oh no!

927
01:11:05,834 --> 01:11:07,941
LIAM: He's dead! Right before the end of the
story!

928
01:11:07,941 --> 01:11:09,933
TRAVIS: Five points of bludgeoning damage.

929
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:11,133
TALIESIN: (whispering) Stop it!

930
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:12,601
LIAM: Sorry, Perce.

931
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:16,905
SAM: I'm sorry, Matt, I'm sorry. I'm going to go
in the opposite direction. I don't want to be in

932
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:22,526
this fucking cluster. It's a mess up there. I'm
going the opposite direction.

933
01:11:22,526 --> 01:11:26,970
LAURA: Down there? Why does it matter that we're
clustered?

934
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:30,641
SAM: I don't care! I'm getting away from you
fuckers. And I'm turning invisible.

935
01:11:30,641 --> 01:11:35,247
(laughter)

936
01:11:35,247 --> 01:11:38,369
LIAM: They come out: "Where did they go?"

937
01:11:38,369 --> 01:11:41,584
TALIESIN: The question is, did you turn invisible,
then run?

938
01:11:41,584 --> 01:11:43,253
LAURA: Yeah, they can still sense you!

939
01:11:43,253 --> 01:11:46,239
SAM: Oh shit! I don't know these things!

940
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:48,885
LAURA: And then we won't know that you didn't get
sucked under!

941
01:11:48,885 --> 01:11:50,783
TRAVIS: And if you attack, your Invisibility
drops.

942
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:56,034
LAURA: Oh, shut up, that's so cool!

943
01:11:56,034 --> 01:11:57,931
TRAVIS: You've got an invisible woman mini!

944
01:11:57,931 --> 01:12:01,252
LIAM: That is my daughter's miniature.

945
01:12:01,252 --> 01:12:02,900
TRAVIS: That is rad.

946
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:05,272
SAM: And as a bonus action, I will Healing Word
myself.

947
01:12:05,272 --> 01:12:07,054
MATT: You'd have to do Healing Word first.

948
01:12:07,054 --> 01:12:09,813
SAM: Huh? Oh, first, because--

949
01:12:09,813 --> 01:12:11,717
MATT: Because if you cast a spell, you lose
Invisibility.

950
01:12:11,717 --> 01:12:12,938
SAM: So I would do it first.

951
01:12:12,938 --> 01:12:17,375
MATT: Yeah, you can do that. All right, that ends
Scanlan's turn. All right.

952
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:18,675
LIAM: Oh. Shit.

953
01:12:18,675 --> 01:12:21,321
SAM: Seven more forms show up.

954
01:12:21,321 --> 01:12:22,453
MATT: First off, let's see--

955
01:12:22,453 --> 01:12:23,805
TRAVIS: Deuces wild.

956
01:12:23,805 --> 01:12:25,010
LIAM: Light them up!

957
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:27,205
MATT: This one is going to emerge from under the
ground--

958
01:12:27,205 --> 01:12:28,869
MARISHA: Do I get an attack of opportunity?

959
01:12:28,869 --> 01:12:33,795
MATT: Hold on. You do not. What is the range on
your fists?

960
01:12:33,795 --> 01:12:35,377
LIAM: 50 feet.

961
01:12:35,377 --> 01:12:37,232
LAURA: Ten feet.

962
01:12:37,232 --> 01:12:41,238
MATT: If it's a ten-foot range on the elemental,
then you would, but--

963
01:12:41,238 --> 01:12:43,362
MARISHA: It doesn't say! How do you know?

964
01:12:43,362 --> 01:12:46,873
MATT: Under the slam attack, it should say range:
five foot? Melee attack?

965
01:12:46,873 --> 01:12:47,951
MARISHA: No.

966
01:12:47,951 --> 01:12:49,517
MATT: What does it say?

967
01:12:49,517 --> 01:12:50,844
MARISHA: No, no, it doesn't. No.

968
01:12:50,844 --> 01:12:52,123
MATT: Okay, then.

969
01:12:52,123 --> 01:12:58,670
MARISHA: I just don't, okay. No! Range: ten feet!
It does say range: ten feet.

970
01:12:58,670 --> 01:13:00,252
MATT: That's what I was asking for.

971
01:13:00,252 --> 01:13:01,785
MARISHA: I didn't know!

972
01:13:01,785 --> 01:13:09,293
MATT: You can use your reaction to get an attack
of opportunity on it. As he glides away from you

973
01:13:09,293 --> 01:13:14,521
and underneath, you get one swing at him. He gets
a plus five to his AC. Actually no, he wouldn't,

974
01:13:14,521 --> 01:13:15,547
because you have earthglide.

975
01:13:15,547 --> 01:13:16,550
MARISHA: 21.

976
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:21,123
MATT: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll damage with the
fist. So you slam him within the stonework.

977
01:13:21,123 --> 01:13:25,959
TALIESIN: I love that you're actually being a
badass where no one can see.

978
01:13:25,959 --> 01:13:28,765
MARISHA: 15.

979
01:13:28,765 --> 01:13:36,892
MATT: 15 points of damage, all right. As you slam
it, your fists gliding through the rock like it

980
01:13:36,892 --> 01:13:42,016
was air, and slamming into the side, pushing it
even further forward, it swoops underneath. And

981
01:13:42,016 --> 01:13:46,717
with a giant uppercut as it emerges from the
ground, the earth swings up to try and consume

982
01:13:46,717 --> 01:13:50,470
both Grog and Trinket. I need you both to make a
dexterity saving throw, Trinket and Grog.

983
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:51,776
LAURA: Oh no!

984
01:13:51,776 --> 01:13:53,404
TRAVIS: Oh shit. Danger sense!

985
01:13:53,404 --> 01:14:00,304
LAURA: Oh no, he rolled a one! Oh no, this was a
fan gift.

986
01:14:00,304 --> 01:14:01,767
TRAVIS: 15.

987
01:14:01,767 --> 01:14:08,505
MATT: Both of you, your vision goes dark as the
earth rises up to consume the space around you.

988
01:14:08,505 --> 01:14:12,808
Both Grog and Trinket are currently restrained and
blinded within the earth.

989
01:14:12,808 --> 01:14:14,895
LAURA: Oh no! Is Trinket right next to Grog, at
least?

990
01:14:14,895 --> 01:14:17,571
MATT: Yeah, they're within a close area.

991
01:14:17,571 --> 01:14:19,457
SAM: Grog, you're inspired.

992
01:14:19,457 --> 01:14:22,578
TRAVIS: Oh! It's too late for that.

993
01:14:22,578 --> 01:14:27,068
MATT: I would say so, the action's already
happened. If you want to, you can. It's what it's

994
01:14:27,068 --> 01:14:28,129
there for.

995
01:14:28,129 --> 01:14:29,485
LIAM: We have a nice DM.

996
01:14:29,485 --> 01:14:30,484
TRAVIS: 18.

997
01:14:30,484 --> 01:14:32,755
MATT: 18. All right, you barely manage to avoid--

998
01:14:32,755 --> 01:14:35,172
LAURA: Oh, now Trinket's all alone!

999
01:14:35,172 --> 01:14:36,618
TRAVIS: You are most gracious.

1000
01:14:36,618 --> 01:14:42,218
MATT: So as the rock comes up to consume you, it
covers over both of you. And there's a brief

1001
01:14:42,218 --> 01:14:50,586
moment of silence before Grog bursts out and steps
up onto the stone, unaffected by the impact. And

1002
01:14:50,586 --> 01:14:58,651
that's its full speed, so it can't earthglide
again. This one here is going to scoot and appear

1003
01:14:58,651 --> 01:15:01,375
right around the edge on that side.

1004
01:15:01,375 --> 01:15:02,826
LIAM: That's in range for me?

1005
01:15:02,826 --> 01:15:03,929
MATT: It is, yes.

1006
01:15:03,929 --> 01:15:05,099
LAURA: And me?

1007
01:15:05,099 --> 01:15:06,317
MATT: Roll a perception check.

1008
01:15:06,317 --> 01:15:08,821
LAURA: Yeah, that's a thing.

1009
01:15:08,821 --> 01:15:11,064
LIAM: 24.

1010
01:15:11,064 --> 01:15:14,164
MATT: That hits. And you do manage to--

1011
01:15:14,164 --> 01:15:15,675
LAURA: 26!

1012
01:15:15,675 --> 01:15:18,552
MATT: You do see it, so you can, if you want.

1013
01:15:18,552 --> 01:15:19,687
LAURA: Okay.

1014
01:15:19,687 --> 01:15:22,280
MATT: Yeah, sorry, I got a notification on my iPad
that went like, "no music."

1015
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:24,548
LIAM: Am I effectively sneak attacking the fool?

1016
01:15:24,548 --> 01:15:26,812
MATT: No.

1017
01:15:26,812 --> 01:15:27,981
LIAM: No. All right.

1018
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:33,970
MATT: The tremor sense-- As you put your feet
against the stalactites, it seems to know where

1019
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:35,004
you are.

1020
01:15:35,004 --> 01:15:36,161
LIAM: Cool. Sharpshooter for both.

1021
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:37,990
LAURA: The first one definitely hits. The second
one is 18.

1022
01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:38,856
MATT: That hits.

1023
01:15:38,856 --> 01:15:40,180
LAURA: Awesome!

1024
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:45,371
LIAM: 28 and 26 for me.

1025
01:15:45,371 --> 01:15:54,024
LAURA: Are you fucking kidding me? He's not
Hunter's Marked.

1026
01:15:54,024 --> 01:16:04,447
LIAM: 38 combined, for my two. My paladin
attacks.

1027
01:16:04,447 --> 01:16:06,230
LAURA: 27, combined.

1028
01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:07,285
MATT: Damage?

1029
01:16:07,285 --> 01:16:08,312
LAURA: Yeah.

1030
01:16:08,312 --> 01:16:12,991
MATT: Okay. As it emerges from behind, you watch
as it brings back both of its fists to attempt to

1031
01:16:12,991 --> 01:16:16,265
slam into the ground where Scanlan is currently
standing.

1032
01:16:16,265 --> 01:16:18,427
SAM: He can't see me. Don't worry.

1033
01:16:18,427 --> 01:16:20,164
(laughter)

1034
01:16:20,164 --> 01:16:24,288
MATT: Yeah. His heavy footfalls still touching and
moving the earth in the vicinity, its tremor sense

1035
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:29,718
still notifying it of your base location. As he
goes to swing both of his fists--

1036
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:32,402
SAM: I'm mocking him.

1037
01:16:32,402 --> 01:16:40,962
MATT: A flurry of daggers and arrows go flying
through the air (whoosh) slamming into it before

1038
01:16:40,962 --> 01:16:45,979
its fist can come down. Its chest is detonated
from the impact, the rock and shale scattering

1039
01:16:45,979 --> 01:16:49,053
against the sides of the wall, its form destroyed
and scattered.

1040
01:16:49,053 --> 01:16:50,386
MARISHA: Kill it!

1041
01:16:50,386 --> 01:16:52,250
LIAM: That's a pretty fucking killer twin moment,
right there.

1042
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:58,065
TRAVIS: I've got to ask, when the creepy rock guy
popped up near me, is he within my held action?

1043
01:16:58,065 --> 01:17:02,914
MATT: Unfortunately, no. He's about ten feet from
you. You've hit in the space, but the bear was

1044
01:17:02,914 --> 01:17:04,079
closer to him.

1045
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:05,578
TRAVIS: Fair enough. I just stare at him.

1046
01:17:05,578 --> 01:17:06,992
MATT: Yes, you do.

1047
01:17:06,992 --> 01:17:15,232
This fellow here emerges right behind
Percival, right there. And is going to attempt to

1048
01:17:15,232 --> 01:17:17,145
make two swing attacks at you.

1049
01:17:17,145 --> 01:17:19,176
TALIESIN: I make two attacks on him before
anything happens, anyway.

1050
01:17:19,176 --> 01:17:21,503
MATT: Mm-hmm. Go for it.

1051
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:24,055
TRAVIS: He's a little drunk. He's got that Soulja
lean going on.

1052
01:17:24,055 --> 01:17:27,375
MATT: Is this with your gun?

1053
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:28,952
TALIESIN: No, this is sword.

1054
01:17:28,952 --> 01:17:29,904
MATT: Yeah.

1055
01:17:29,904 --> 01:17:38,135
TALIESIN: Too close. I knew they would jump, so.
That's 22 and 24.

1056
01:17:38,135 --> 01:17:41,325
LAURA: I need more coffee.

1057
01:17:41,325 --> 01:17:43,842
LIAM: You're at your most dashing when you use
your sword.

1058
01:17:43,842 --> 01:17:57,932
TALIESIN: Yes, you know. That's 26 points of
damage. Oh, wait! I get three attacks, don't I,

1059
01:17:57,932 --> 01:17:59,087
that's right?

1060
01:17:59,087 --> 01:18:00,989
MATT: Yeah! Because you're on fire, dude!

1061
01:18:00,989 --> 01:18:05,560
TALIESIN: That's right. 26 points of damage plus--
Oh yeah, that definitely hits. Plus eight more

1062
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,291
points of damage.

1063
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:13,650
MATT: All right. So as it emerges from the wall,
coming toward you. You do this triple strike

1064
01:18:13,650 --> 01:18:17,895
against it. And it manages to carve across part of
its chest, but its momentum is still strong, and

1065
01:18:17,895 --> 01:18:23,227
both fists come to the side to hit you and rattle
you from both sides. That is a 16?

1066
01:18:23,227 --> 01:18:24,189
TALIESIN: Nope!

1067
01:18:24,189 --> 01:18:25,763
MATT: Misses! And a 24.

1068
01:18:25,763 --> 01:18:26,831
TALIESIN: And that hits.

1069
01:18:26,831 --> 01:18:34,316
MATT: So you manage to deflect one blow, the other
one clocks you on the side of the head. That is 11

1070
01:18:34,316 --> 01:18:35,925
points of bludgeoning damage.

1071
01:18:35,925 --> 01:18:41,889
TALIESIN: Yeah, okay. There's all the healing I
just did. It's all gone.

1072
01:18:41,889 --> 01:18:47,861
MATT: All right. And now this fellow here is going
to swoop over and slam the ground near Pike.

1073
01:18:47,861 --> 01:18:49,487
LAURA: Oh, good! She can attack him!

1074
01:18:49,487 --> 01:18:54,499
MATT: The range on this is a ten by ten-foot cube,
so he's going to do it before he gets in melee

1075
01:18:54,499 --> 01:18:59,907
range of her, she's right there. So as it glides
toward her, it slams the ground, and the earth is

1076
01:18:59,907 --> 01:19:02,626
going to attempt to consume her. She needs to make
a dexterity saving throw.

1077
01:19:02,626 --> 01:19:03,768
LAURA: I want to do it.

1078
01:19:03,768 --> 01:19:04,897
LIAM: Okay, you do it.

1079
01:19:04,897 --> 01:19:06,369
LAURA: I should not have claimed this.

1080
01:19:06,369 --> 01:19:07,734
TRAVIS: With that dice?

1081
01:19:07,734 --> 01:19:11,559
LAURA: Oh. We don't add anything to it.

1082
01:19:11,559 --> 01:19:13,339
LIAM: It is a big seven.

1083
01:19:13,339 --> 01:19:24,178
MATT: And with that, the ground consumes Pike, who
is now buried, blinded, and restrained within.

1084
01:19:24,178 --> 01:19:26,838
LAURA: She was saving her action, though!

1085
01:19:26,838 --> 01:19:31,512
MATT: And with the rest of its movement, it's
going to sink into the ground. We'll say--

1086
01:19:31,512 --> 01:19:41,865
(counting) Yeah, it'll sink into the ground. Just
out of range. I'll put it here, just to mention

1087
01:19:41,865 --> 01:19:44,517
where it is, but consider it's not prone, it's
underground.

1088
01:19:44,517 --> 01:19:47,933
LIAM: It means he gave it rum tongue.

1089
01:19:47,933 --> 01:19:50,290
MATT: You're going to die tonight.

1090
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:53,711
(laughter)

1091
01:19:53,711 --> 01:19:56,132
TRAVIS: With such dedication!

1092
01:19:56,132 --> 01:19:58,656
MATT: This one here is going to swing back
around--

1093
01:19:58,656 --> 01:20:00,250
TALIESIN: Attack of opportunity!

1094
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:06,902
MATT: She already took one. One reaction. This one
bursts out of the ground to leap towards you. As it

1095
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:11,270
emerges, it looks up and sees you just within its
range, it does have a bit of a reach. And it leaps

1096
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:16,888
to go ahead and make two swings at you. Natural
one. You manage to pull back with the broom and it

1097
01:20:16,888 --> 01:20:21,734
swings wide and lands on the ground, and it's
going to attempt to go with another uppercut in

1098
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:23,376
your direction. That is a 15.

1099
01:20:23,376 --> 01:20:26,434
LAURA: It doesn't hit. I put my foot on its fist
and--

1100
01:20:26,434 --> 01:20:34,504
MATT: (laughs) Ding! No effect on that. And that's
going to end its turn, that's his full move. All right,

1101
01:20:34,504 --> 01:20:36,032
so that brings us to Keyleth.

1102
01:20:36,032 --> 01:20:39,494
MARISHA: Okay. Do I see Trinket underground?

1103
01:20:39,494 --> 01:20:41,915
MATT: You can sense Trinket is currently buried.

1104
01:20:41,915 --> 01:20:43,490
LAURA: Oh my god, thank you so much!

1105
01:20:43,490 --> 01:20:45,478
MARISHA: Jesus, that scared the shit out of me.

1106
01:20:45,478 --> 01:20:47,122
SAM: You said "I want coffee," and you got
coffee?

1107
01:20:47,122 --> 01:20:50,342
LAURA: I know! But I didn't think anybody was
going to do it, really!

1108
01:20:50,342 --> 01:20:51,570
MATT: I want a pony!

1109
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:53,108
SAM: I want ice cream!

1110
01:20:53,108 --> 01:20:54,574
TALIESIN: Fly into the air!

1111
01:20:54,574 --> 01:20:56,299
TRAVIS: I want that PowerBall winnings.

1112
01:20:56,299 --> 01:21:03,579
MATT: If anyone could do it, Ryan Green could. All
righty. So, Keyleth, you can sense Trinket is

1113
01:21:03,579 --> 01:21:05,679
buried over there, and Pike.

1114
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:10,635
MARISHA: Do I go for the bear, or do I go for the
gnome?

1115
01:21:10,635 --> 01:21:12,476
LAURA: Go for the gnome!

1116
01:21:12,476 --> 01:21:14,963
MARISHA: All right, can I get to Pike in 50 feet?

1117
01:21:14,963 --> 01:21:16,247
MATT: What's your movement?

1118
01:21:16,247 --> 01:21:17,144
MARISHA: 50.

1119
01:21:17,144 --> 01:21:20,283
MATT: 50 feet glide? You can.

1120
01:21:20,283 --> 01:21:35,650
MARISHA: Okay. Can I very gently grab the gnome,
and then siege monster bust us out?

1121
01:21:35,650 --> 01:21:38,533
MATT: Okay, make a strength check. I'll give you
advantage because you are a siege monster.

1122
01:21:38,533 --> 01:21:40,614
TRAVIS: Because you're a siege monster!

1123
01:21:40,614 --> 01:21:43,815
MARISHA: I'm a siege monster!

1124
01:21:43,815 --> 01:21:46,419
LIAM: Is it like reaching into a sack for you,
even though it's the earth?

1125
01:21:46,419 --> 01:21:54,116
MARISHA: It's like air, he said. I will take that
17, that is much better. For a 22.

1126
01:21:54,116 --> 01:21:59,287
MATT: With no issue, you punch through the massive
rock and earth right there, and you emerge out of

1127
01:21:59,287 --> 01:22:04,384
it like a shoryuken, clutching Pike in your left
arm as you land back on your elemental feet in

1128
01:22:04,384 --> 01:22:06,988
that space, bringing both of you--

1129
01:22:06,988 --> 01:22:10,672
MARISHA: (excited earth elemental grunting)

1130
01:22:10,672 --> 01:22:14,824
TRAVIS: (answering grunts) It sounds like a
concrete mixer.

1131
01:22:14,824 --> 01:22:21,715
MATT: All righty. I believe that ends your turn?

1132
01:22:21,715 --> 01:22:23,642
MARISHA: I can't do anything else, probably.

1133
01:22:23,642 --> 01:22:25,455
MATT: Pike can, because it's her turn.

1134
01:22:25,455 --> 01:22:31,252
MARISHA: But Pike can! So holding little Pike like
a voodoo doll, like a flashlight.

1135
01:22:31,252 --> 01:22:33,080
MATT: Do things!

1136
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:34,884
LAURA: That means she can still attack?

1137
01:22:34,884 --> 01:22:36,179
MATT: She can, yeah.

1138
01:22:36,179 --> 01:22:37,600
LAURA: She can't see anything, though.

1139
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,518
MATT: No, she can, now. Keyleth just pulled her
out of the rubble and is holding her in front.

1140
01:22:40,518 --> 01:22:43,088
LAURA: No, I mean, there's nothing to attack in
front of her.

1141
01:22:43,088 --> 01:22:44,521
LIAM: What's this thing on the ground?

1142
01:22:44,521 --> 01:22:46,126
LAURA: He's underground, still.

1143
01:22:46,126 --> 01:22:48,968
TALIESIN: So there's two above ground, but they're
behind her.

1144
01:22:48,968 --> 01:22:51,811
MARISHA: But I'm holding Pike! Can she see?

1145
01:22:51,811 --> 01:22:53,111
LIAM: Can you throw her?

1146
01:22:53,111 --> 01:22:58,498
LAURA: We're holding a physical action, so she has
to be next to something in order to attack it.

1147
01:22:58,498 --> 01:22:59,698
MARISHA: Oh.

1148
01:22:59,698 --> 01:23:01,306
TRAVIS: That's why mine didn't happen, either.

1149
01:23:01,306 --> 01:23:02,793
MATT: Yeah, she can do whatever she wants.

1150
01:23:02,793 --> 01:23:04,711
LIAM: And it would be an action to chuck her,
though, right?

1151
01:23:04,711 --> 01:23:06,398
MATT: Yeah, she already pulled her free with her
action, so--

1152
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:08,556
LAURA: Did you use all your movement?

1153
01:23:08,556 --> 01:23:10,063
MATT: She did.

1154
01:23:10,063 --> 01:23:11,427
MARISHA: To get there.

1155
01:23:11,427 --> 01:23:13,245
MATT: Well, actually, you had ten more feet, if
you wanted to.

1156
01:23:13,245 --> 01:23:16,405
LAURA: Can you get within ten feet of something?
Five feet of something.

1157
01:23:16,405 --> 01:23:17,929
MATT: No, unfortunately, no.

1158
01:23:17,929 --> 01:23:22,319
LIAM: I mean, we could drop her where the thing
disappeared. It's still a crapshoot, but it's

1159
01:23:22,319 --> 01:23:26,224
better than nothing. "Drop me on the ground,
Keyleth!"

1160
01:23:26,224 --> 01:23:28,661
LAURA: "I want to be able to hit it if it comes
up!"

1161
01:23:28,661 --> 01:23:31,872
MARISHA: (agreeing elemental grunts) (heavy thud)

1162
01:23:31,872 --> 01:23:35,877
MATT: Sets the gnome down on the ground. That ends
Keyleth's turn. Now it's Pike's go.

1163
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:39,401
LIAM: Okay, she is going to still just hold her
turn--

1164
01:23:39,401 --> 01:23:44,323
LAURA: Oh man! Should she do a cantrip? She should
do a Resistance or something?

1165
01:23:44,323 --> 01:23:48,883
LIAM: She could do it on herself, just in case.
Yeah, cast Resistance on herself in case--

1166
01:23:48,883 --> 01:23:50,872
LAURA: But that's an action, it's not a bonus.

1167
01:23:50,872 --> 01:23:56,189
LIAM: Instead, she's going to look at the ground
and go, "Monstah!" And hold her mace.

1168
01:23:56,189 --> 01:23:58,740
MATT: So she's holding her action to attack,
perfect. Percival, you're up. Top of the round.

1169
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:03,793
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull out the gun and take
three shots at that thing that's swinging at Vex.

1170
01:24:03,793 --> 01:24:05,428
MATT: Okay, go for it.

1171
01:24:05,428 --> 01:24:16,153
TALIESIN: Yeah! Oof, that's close. That's a 19?

1172
01:24:16,153 --> 01:24:17,832
MATT: 19 hits.

1173
01:24:17,832 --> 01:24:24,184
TALIESIN: Then the rest of them hit, too. It's
like 21 and 20, so let's get some d10s out.

1174
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:27,011
MARISHA: Do you need some more?

1175
01:24:27,011 --> 01:24:40,921
TALIESIN: No, I got enough. Some d10s and some
d6s. So here we go. (counting) That's 12 points of

1176
01:24:40,921 --> 01:24:43,112
psychic damage.

1177
01:24:43,112 --> 01:24:44,964
TRAVIS: (makes weird noise)

1178
01:24:44,964 --> 01:24:47,975
TALIESIN: I don't know what that was.

1179
01:24:47,975 --> 01:24:50,290
LIAM: There is weird energy at this table!

1180
01:24:50,290 --> 01:24:58,045
MATT: Okay, the first shot? As you reach over and
fire at that one, you hit it, and you watch as it

1181
01:24:58,045 --> 01:25:00,415
scatters into stones across the far--

1182
01:25:00,415 --> 01:25:03,909
TALIESIN: I'll put the first shot at that, and
then shift the next two to the other one.

1183
01:25:03,909 --> 01:25:05,322
MATT: Yep. They have the same AC.

1184
01:25:05,322 --> 01:25:13,129
TALIESIN: Okay, so that's seven points of psychic
damage, and 36 points of normal damage!

1185
01:25:13,129 --> 01:25:13,934
MATT: To that one?

1186
01:25:13,934 --> 01:25:15,179
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1187
01:25:15,179 --> 01:25:23,806
MATT: Okay, as the second one does blast a large
chunk out of its torso and side, it still stands

1188
01:25:23,806 --> 01:25:26,787
there with its angered arms open, ready to swing at
whatever comes at it.

1189
01:25:26,787 --> 01:25:30,053
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm good!

1190
01:25:30,053 --> 01:25:32,293
MATT: All right, that ends Percival's turn. Grog,
you're up.

1191
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:39,197
TRAVIS: (grunts) Can I run over to the thing--

1192
01:25:39,197 --> 01:25:41,796
MATT: You're standing above Trinket now.

1193
01:25:41,796 --> 01:25:46,113
TRAVIS: It's just a pound of earth, right? I don't
hear anything, or see any fur or claws?

1194
01:25:46,113 --> 01:25:47,762
MATT: No, not in a rage, you don't.

1195
01:25:47,762 --> 01:25:53,488
TRAVIS: Fuck that shit! I reckless, Great Weapon
Master attack old Boney Face! Oh, that's terrible.

1196
01:25:53,488 --> 01:26:01,295
That's better! Thank god for reckless! Sorry, 30
minus five, 25!

1197
01:26:01,295 --> 01:26:02,468
MATT: That hits.

1198
01:26:02,468 --> 01:26:12,547
TRAVIS: Yes! 33, plus the necrotic damage.

1199
01:26:12,547 --> 01:26:14,769
LAURA: I'm going to help. I'm right there.

1200
01:26:14,769 --> 01:26:15,994
SAM: Is there a guy next to you?

1201
01:26:15,994 --> 01:26:17,502
LAURA: That's what I'm going to be aiming at,
darling.

1202
01:26:17,502 --> 01:26:25,743
TRAVIS: Second attack. 26.

1203
01:26:25,743 --> 01:26:27,900
MATT: That hits.

1204
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:38,187
TRAVIS: 28. No, 38!

1205
01:26:38,187 --> 01:26:42,881
MATT: 38. Okay! As you stand over Trinket, the
first hit cleaves into the center of its chest,

1206
01:26:42,881 --> 01:26:47,494
and wedges itself there, and you see the rocks
forming over the axe, almost trying to pull it

1207
01:26:47,494 --> 01:26:50,943
into its body to pull it from your grip. And as
you do, instead you reach down and put your foot

1208
01:26:50,943 --> 01:26:56,276
onto its chest and yank it outward. And as you do,
as most of it began to form over the axe, it

1209
01:26:56,276 --> 01:26:59,338
bisects it in two and it crumples into a pile of
dirt on the ground.

1210
01:26:59,338 --> 01:27:01,283
(cheering)

1211
01:27:01,283 --> 01:27:08,357
MATT: So you still have 45 feet of movement.

1212
01:27:08,357 --> 01:27:16,012
TRAVIS: Should I run down this tunnel and see
what's down here?

1213
01:27:16,012 --> 01:27:17,161
MARISHA: Yeah.

1214
01:27:17,161 --> 01:27:18,360
TRAVIS: Yeah?

1215
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:20,862
LIAM: No! No!

1216
01:27:20,862 --> 01:27:23,206
LAURA: He's raging! He doesn't have logic!

1217
01:27:23,206 --> 01:27:26,858
TRAVIS: Can I see him from wherever I am? This
enemy?

1218
01:27:26,858 --> 01:27:30,218
MATT: Yeah, I'd say you can. He's emerged. You can
see the movement.

1219
01:27:30,218 --> 01:27:31,908
TRAVIS: I'll run up and join Percy.

1220
01:27:31,908 --> 01:27:38,471
MATT: Okay. So you charge up beside, leap onto
this platform of soft earth and rock, and it's

1221
01:27:38,471 --> 01:27:40,017
right there next to you.

1222
01:27:40,017 --> 01:27:40,864
TRAVIS: Nice.

1223
01:27:40,864 --> 01:27:42,638
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Vex.

1224
01:27:42,638 --> 01:27:50,031
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to move my Hunter's Mark
over to that dude (radar sounds) and then I'm

1225
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:53,516
going to attack him with sharpshooter!

1226
01:27:53,516 --> 01:27:55,976
LIAM: (laughs) Didgeridoos?

1227
01:27:55,976 --> 01:27:57,501
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yep.

1228
01:27:57,501 --> 01:28:00,934
SAM: Your Hunter's Mark sounds like Didgeridoos.
Or rain sticks.

1229
01:28:00,934 --> 01:28:03,366
LAURA: So I'm at 20?

1230
01:28:03,366 --> 01:28:05,450
MATT: 20 hits, yeah.

1231
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:09,763
LAURA: Okay. This is so weird!

1232
01:28:09,763 --> 01:28:14,238
TALIESIN: This is super serious, you guys.

1233
01:28:14,238 --> 01:28:16,237
LAURA: Four lightning damage.

1234
01:28:16,237 --> 01:28:20,682
SAM: Don't worry, you'll be sleeping a lot at
Burning Man.

1235
01:28:20,682 --> 01:28:31,489
LAURA: 28 for the first arrow. Plus the four
lightning damage.

1236
01:28:31,489 --> 01:28:32,738
MATT: Yeah.

1237
01:28:32,738 --> 01:28:40,013
LAURA: And then the second attack is also
sharpshooter, and that one hits.

1238
01:28:40,013 --> 01:28:42,104
MATT: Okay. Even with the minus five?

1239
01:28:42,104 --> 01:28:43,886
LAURA: Yes. Definitely.

1240
01:28:43,886 --> 01:28:49,829
LIAM: Sam, when everyone leaves, all their stress
will enter you and I.

1241
01:28:49,829 --> 01:28:51,986
TALIESIN: I'm very excited about that.

1242
01:28:51,986 --> 01:28:53,568
LAURA: Six lightning damage.

1243
01:28:53,568 --> 01:28:58,210
MARISHA: Like a lich. A phylactery.

1244
01:28:58,210 --> 01:29:05,360
LAURA: 19! Oh! And I didn't add plus 20 to both of
those! Plus 20 overall because of the

1245
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:06,394
sharpshooter.

1246
01:29:06,394 --> 01:29:12,979
MATT: All right. So with that, as you see it
crawling towards Percival, trying to grow and leap

1247
01:29:12,979 --> 01:29:17,993
at it, and Grog leaps up in its way, there's a
very little space where you can actually see its

1248
01:29:17,993 --> 01:29:22,899
movement. And as you watch Grog pull back with the
axe to almost go for a secondary strike, that

1249
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:26,577
brief opening, you see you have both arrows
notched and releasing both at the same time and as

1250
01:29:26,577 --> 01:29:31,864
it does it sinks into both of the sockets where
the dark void of its eyes were. And it goes

1251
01:29:31,864 --> 01:29:36,185
(creaking, crashing) and then falls into scattered
pieces of rock.

1252
01:29:36,185 --> 01:29:39,708
LAURA: You're welcome!

1253
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:41,106
TALIESIN: Oh, very nice.

1254
01:29:41,106 --> 01:29:45,969
MATT: All right. Do you want to move, or stay
where you are?

1255
01:29:45,969 --> 01:29:46,997
LAURA: I'm going to stay.

1256
01:29:46,997 --> 01:29:48,351
MATT: All right. Vax, you're up.

1257
01:29:48,351 --> 01:29:51,436
LAURA: Wait! What about Trinket? Can he try to
save against it?

1258
01:29:51,436 --> 01:29:58,153
MATT: I'll say I'll give you an action for Trinket
instead of an attack to attempt to break free.

1259
01:29:58,153 --> 01:30:01,174
Make a strength check. Strength saving throw.

1260
01:30:01,174 --> 01:30:06,452
LAURA: I don't know what the difference for a
saving throw for Trinket would be.

1261
01:30:06,452 --> 01:30:07,877
MATT: Strength modifier.

1262
01:30:07,877 --> 01:30:08,972
LAURA: 15.

1263
01:30:08,972 --> 01:30:11,067
MATT: 15? Unfortunately, cannot break free. It's
not strong enough.

1264
01:30:11,067 --> 01:30:13,033
LAURA: Can I hear him? Does he make noise?

1265
01:30:13,033 --> 01:30:17,285
MATT: You listen, and you hear the shifting of
rock. That's it.

1266
01:30:17,285 --> 01:30:19,384
LAURA: I don't even know it's Trinket, do I?

1267
01:30:19,384 --> 01:30:20,493
MATT: Yeah, you don't.

1268
01:30:20,493 --> 01:30:22,478
LAURA: I aim my bow at it.

1269
01:30:22,478 --> 01:30:26,011
MATT: Okay. Vax, what are you doing?

1270
01:30:26,011 --> 01:30:30,673
LIAM: I'm going to fly over and land on Keyleth's
shoulder and hold my attack for as soon as the

1271
01:30:30,673 --> 01:30:32,240
fucknut appears.

1272
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:33,316
MATT: Okay.

1273
01:30:33,316 --> 01:30:37,824
LIAM: Perch. Dagon.

1274
01:30:37,824 --> 01:30:43,385
MATT: Like your own personal raven. All right,
ending Vax's turn. Scanlan, you're up.

1275
01:30:43,385 --> 01:30:47,173
SAM: I will use my insane climbing speed of ten?

1276
01:30:47,173 --> 01:30:50,014
(laughter)

1277
01:30:50,014 --> 01:30:55,771
SAM: To climb up that tree-like stalagmite.

1278
01:30:55,771 --> 01:31:01,309
MATT: This technically is a root, and you climb up
into it.

1279
01:31:01,309 --> 01:31:10,873
SAM: I will hold my attack until I see something
come out of somewhere.

1280
01:31:10,873 --> 01:31:12,400
MATT: Okay, so your weapon's at the ready?

1281
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,376
SAM: My Wand of Magic Missiles.

1282
01:31:14,376 --> 01:31:25,669
MATT: Okay. Great. All right, so that ends
Scanlan's turn. At this point, shifting beneath

1283
01:31:25,669 --> 01:31:30,433
the ground and emerging right there behind Pike--

1284
01:31:30,433 --> 01:31:32,027
LAURA: She's attacking it.

1285
01:31:32,027 --> 01:31:37,375
TRAVIS: It gets to act first.

1286
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:44,691
LAURA: Does it? No, she gets to act first. Yeah!
So that's 24 to attack.

1287
01:31:44,691 --> 01:31:46,722
MATT: 24 to attack? That hits.

1288
01:31:46,722 --> 01:31:50,759
LIAM: And she'll use divine whatsit. Divine
Strike.

1289
01:31:50,759 --> 01:31:52,511
LAURA: She always gets that now.

1290
01:31:52,511 --> 01:31:53,850
LIAM: Once a round.

1291
01:31:53,850 --> 01:32:01,570
LAURA: That's 2d6 plus four radiant damage, so
ten, 14.

1292
01:32:01,570 --> 01:32:05,970
LIAM: Plus 2d8.

1293
01:32:05,970 --> 01:32:08,268
TRAVIS: I thought that went in the coffee.

1294
01:32:08,268 --> 01:32:10,083
LAURA: Should that count?

1295
01:32:10,083 --> 01:32:11,746
SAM: You didn't intentionally roll it.

1296
01:32:11,746 --> 01:32:13,569
LIAM: Do it again.

1297
01:32:13,569 --> 01:32:17,763
LAURA: It's not as good as the unintentional, but
that's okay. 19.

1298
01:32:17,763 --> 01:32:19,138
MATT: 19?

1299
01:32:19,138 --> 01:32:21,478
LAURA: Yeah. Does she just attack the once?

1300
01:32:21,478 --> 01:32:24,472
LIAM: Yeah, and if it's still standing, dagger,
dagger, dagger.

1301
01:32:24,472 --> 01:32:41,154
MATT: Hold on. Let me check one thing real fast.
The war cleric... Actually, yeah, because it's a

1302
01:32:41,154 --> 01:32:47,389
bonus action to do that. Against that one? How
does Pike want to do this?

1303
01:32:47,389 --> 01:32:49,552
(cheering)

1304
01:32:49,552 --> 01:32:51,169
TRAVIS: Pikey!

1305
01:32:51,169 --> 01:32:53,535
LAURA: She goes, "Grog, watch this!"

1306
01:32:53,535 --> 01:32:56,245
TRAVIS: I can't see anything because a person's in
the way.

1307
01:32:56,245 --> 01:32:57,715
LAURA: You can see; you're big.

1308
01:32:57,715 --> 01:33:02,014
LIAM: She does an underswing right up between its
legs and hits it in the goolies.

1309
01:33:02,014 --> 01:33:10,709
MATT: As she does, the glowing mace scatters
upward, breaking layer after layer of rock and

1310
01:33:10,709 --> 01:33:17,059
earth. Its upper torso explodes into the ceiling,
a shower of small pebbles and errant pieces of

1311
01:33:17,059 --> 01:33:20,311
earth are smeared across the wall and scatter to
the ground.

1312
01:33:20,311 --> 01:33:22,113
TRAVIS: Untamed monster!

1313
01:33:22,113 --> 01:33:26,924
LIAM: She gives it three or four more hits on the
ground out of frustration.

1314
01:33:26,924 --> 01:33:28,650
LAURA: Yeah, because she got trapped.

1315
01:33:28,650 --> 01:33:29,977
LIAM: Yep.

1316
01:33:29,977 --> 01:33:32,073
MARISHA: I go rescue the bear.

1317
01:33:32,073 --> 01:33:35,373
LAURA: Be careful! I think there's another
elemental right there.

1318
01:33:35,373 --> 01:33:37,165
MARISHA: Are there any more?

1319
01:33:37,165 --> 01:33:39,126
LAURA: I think Trinket's an elemental.

1320
01:33:39,126 --> 01:33:48,343
MATT: As you guys all make your way over to the
pile, as it's shifting and moving, you all prepare

1321
01:33:48,343 --> 01:33:56,448
your weaponry for what might emerge. Make a
perception check, Vex.

1322
01:33:56,448 --> 01:34:03,439
LAURA: Oh no, don't you make me attack my own
bear. Oh no. 17?

1323
01:34:03,439 --> 01:34:10,210
MATT: That's plenty. The moment you see some of
the movement push through, a claw begins to emerge

1324
01:34:10,210 --> 01:34:14,449
from it and your arrow pulls back, ready to
release, but the moment it's there, you

1325
01:34:14,449 --> 01:34:16,687
immediately wonder how you could have made that
mistake.

1326
01:34:16,687 --> 01:34:18,101
LAURA: Trinket! I run.

1327
01:34:18,101 --> 01:34:20,437
MATT: All of you rush over and begin to help
Trinket free.

1328
01:34:20,437 --> 01:34:26,302
LIAM: I place my hand on Scanlan's shoulder and
say: I'm sorry. I know this is hard for you. The

1329
01:34:26,302 --> 01:34:27,851
bear lives.

1330
01:34:27,851 --> 01:34:32,898
SAM: And I say from the top of the tree, I don't
know who you're touching, but I'm up on top of a tree.

1331
01:34:32,898 --> 01:34:34,214
LIAM: I'm flying!

1332
01:34:34,214 --> 01:34:35,565
SAM: I'm invisible.

1333
01:34:35,565 --> 01:34:37,853
(laughter)

1334
01:34:37,853 --> 01:34:44,203
LIAM: There's a lot of rules in this game. Staying
on theme for the night.

1335
01:34:44,203 --> 01:34:51,959
SAM: Yes, I know. It lives, for now. I was holding
my action; I could blast the bear with my wand.

1336
01:34:51,959 --> 01:34:55,122
She wouldn't even know where I was coming from.

1337
01:34:55,122 --> 01:34:57,156
LAURA: I would see you the minute you attacked.

1338
01:34:57,156 --> 01:34:58,456
SAM: (whispering) Oh, she's right.

1339
01:34:58,456 --> 01:35:01,300
(laughter)

1340
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:13,172
MATT: So this battle has transpired in the length
of one stride of the Titan, as the other footfall

1341
01:35:13,172 --> 01:35:18,857
lands, (thumping) one portion of the wall begins
to shake and fall in and this side of the tunnel

1342
01:35:18,857 --> 01:35:20,207
begins to collapse.

1343
01:35:20,207 --> 01:35:21,977
LAURA: Oh, we got to take off, we got to start
moving.

1344
01:35:21,977 --> 01:35:26,201
MARISHA: Keyleth blocks as much as she can and
goes (earth elemental speaking).

1345
01:35:26,201 --> 01:35:27,771
LAURA: Run. I think she's saying run.

1346
01:35:27,771 --> 01:35:33,522
MATT: So as you guys dart down and head left into
the hallway, your earth elemental form allows you

1347
01:35:33,522 --> 01:35:37,143
with quite a bit of strength to force it and
prevent it from causing the entire tunnel to

1348
01:35:37,143 --> 01:35:42,262
collapse. Just half of it does, and holding that
in space you guys begin to charge down the left

1349
01:35:42,262 --> 01:35:43,668
side of the tunnel.

1350
01:35:43,668 --> 01:35:49,463
LAURA: As we're running I cast Pass Without A
Trace again. Should I?

1351
01:35:49,463 --> 01:35:51,605
LIAM: Sure, sure.

1352
01:35:51,605 --> 01:35:55,806
And I pat your big stony face and give it a
kiss and fly down the hall.

1353
01:35:55,806 --> 01:35:58,166
LAURA: Okay, never mind, I don't cast it.

1354
01:35:58,166 --> 01:36:05,741
MATT: Okay. As you guys continue down the left
path for about 50 or so feet, it curves rapidly to

1355
01:36:05,741 --> 01:36:14,524
the left and stops at a cylindrical chamber. It's
still a cavernous space, but it has a cylindrical

1356
01:36:14,524 --> 01:36:21,272
shape to it. About 40 feet in diameter, about 50
feet tall at its apex, and in the center of it,

1357
01:36:21,347 --> 01:36:26,316
you see a partially collapsed dark stone pavilion
or small temple.

1358
01:36:26,316 --> 01:36:28,566
LIAM: At the bottom in the middle?

1359
01:36:28,566 --> 01:36:33,695
MATT: Well, you guys turn and it's in the center
of this chamber that rises up before you in the

1360
01:36:33,695 --> 01:36:40,764
center of this small, egg-shaped opening, the
space. And you see this made of a deep, dark,

1361
01:36:40,764 --> 01:36:47,355
grayish, almost black stone structure that looks
beautifully made. The craftwork is distinctly dwarven.

1362
01:36:47,355 --> 01:36:48,767
LAURA: Is it old?

1363
01:36:48,767 --> 01:36:51,164
MATT: You can go make an investigation check on it
if you'd like.

1364
01:36:51,164 --> 01:36:52,758
LIAM: I'm going to do Divine Sense again.

1365
01:36:52,758 --> 01:36:53,799
MATT: Okay.

1366
01:36:53,799 --> 01:36:54,761
LIAM: For undead.

1367
01:36:54,761 --> 01:36:56,209
TRAVIS: They're everywhere.

1368
01:36:56,209 --> 01:36:57,724
MATT: You do sense--

1369
01:36:57,724 --> 01:37:00,490
LIAM: Specifically a location.

1370
01:37:00,490 --> 01:37:04,262
MATT: --specifically within the heart of this
structure.

1371
01:37:04,262 --> 01:37:12,963
LAURA: Is this--? No, this is not mountain.

1372
01:37:12,963 --> 01:37:14,679
TRAVIS: (laughs) No!

1373
01:37:14,679 --> 01:37:16,364
LAURA: This is titan.

1374
01:37:16,364 --> 01:37:19,001
TRAVIS: (Laura voice) Is this favored terrain?

1375
01:37:19,001 --> 01:37:22,634
MATT: This would be considered subterranean. It
would be like an underground.

1376
01:37:22,634 --> 01:37:25,916
LAURA: Okay, so not Underdark?

1377
01:37:25,916 --> 01:37:31,063
MATT: Not Underdark, no. The structure, however,
is somewhat damaged from a collapse on one side of

1378
01:37:31,063 --> 01:37:37,553
the wall. You watch as part of the chamber on the
right side has come loose and this rockslide has

1379
01:37:37,553 --> 01:37:43,584
jammed into the side of the structure. And looking
past the craggy piles of loose rock, you can see

1380
01:37:43,584 --> 01:37:49,383
shattered glass across the ground, and part of the
rock as the rockslide has pushed into one of these

1381
01:37:49,383 --> 01:37:58,425
glass panels that marks the exterior of the small,
gazebo-like temple structure. It seems to have

1382
01:37:58,425 --> 01:38:03,632
filled, from what you can see at least at this
distance, a portion of the interior as well. There

1383
01:38:03,632 --> 01:38:09,125
is a double door in the front that is currently
closed and the right side of the door is buried

1384
01:38:09,125 --> 01:38:13,941
partially by the remainder of this rockslide that
has come to a halt at the base of the structure.

1385
01:38:13,941 --> 01:38:18,676
LAURA: Do we know what gods dwarves worshipped? Do
they have specific gods?

1386
01:38:18,676 --> 01:38:20,066
MATT: Make a religion check.

1387
01:38:20,066 --> 01:38:21,523
LIAM: These are dead dwarves.

1388
01:38:21,523 --> 01:38:30,343
Pike starts whispering, "I can technically
destroy dead things, so, if we sneak me up to the

1389
01:38:30,343 --> 01:38:31,717
"outside of the wall--"

1390
01:38:31,717 --> 01:38:32,754
LAURA: Five.

1391
01:38:32,754 --> 01:38:41,133
MATT: I mean, you ran into the Allfather's space
before, but not every dwarf worships the

1392
01:38:41,133 --> 01:38:46,042
Allfather. Just like any other free race in the
world, religion's up for grabs.

1393
01:38:46,042 --> 01:38:49,011
TALIESIN: Knowing the history of this city, would
we know what this is?

1394
01:38:49,011 --> 01:38:56,804
MATT: You don't know what this is at first glance.
The structure seems ceremonial or at least

1395
01:38:56,804 --> 01:38:58,059
important.

1396
01:38:58,059 --> 01:39:02,246
It seems to have been placed here with intent away
from a large part of society.

1397
01:39:02,246 --> 01:39:05,595
TALIESIN: It's not a crypt or anything like that?
Or a very expensive crypt.

1398
01:39:05,595 --> 01:39:06,695
MATT: It could be.

1399
01:39:06,695 --> 01:39:09,184
TRAVIS: Do we see the inside of the gazebo-type
structure?

1400
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:10,961
LIAM: How big is it, too?

1401
01:39:10,961 --> 01:39:18,353
MATT: How big is it? It's about, maybe, I'd say,
35 feet wide? It almost fills the entirety of the

1402
01:39:18,353 --> 01:39:21,647
chamber. There's like a slight space behind it,
except for the fact that part of the wall

1403
01:39:21,647 --> 01:39:25,340
collapsed into it and is burying the right side of
the structure.

1404
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:26,902
TRAVIS: Colored glass?

1405
01:39:26,902 --> 01:39:31,233
MATT: Looking at the glass, it's multiple colors.
Looks to be of stained glass type, and it's a

1406
01:39:31,233 --> 01:39:36,276
thick glass. And there is one intact window of
stained glass on the opposite side and there is

1407
01:39:36,276 --> 01:39:38,784
the double doors currently that keep it shut.

1408
01:39:38,784 --> 01:39:41,636
TALIESIN: Is there an image on the stained glass.
Is it depicting something?

1409
01:39:41,636 --> 01:39:52,089
MATT: It looks to depict a dwarvish-like figure,
adorned in golden armor, that stands at the

1410
01:39:52,089 --> 01:39:58,562
precipice of a mountain, with a series of smaller
dwarf-like entities in shadow all around looking

1411
01:39:58,562 --> 01:40:05,438
up at it. It's very simple when you get up close
to it, but the further back you go, it's a

1412
01:40:05,438 --> 01:40:06,762
beautiful arrangement.

1413
01:40:06,762 --> 01:40:08,528
TALIESIN: I bet it's a crypt, which means that
it's trapped, and I bet that means there's

1414
01:40:08,528 --> 01:40:10,086
something expensive and interesting inside.

1415
01:40:10,086 --> 01:40:11,226
LIAM: DM, question.

1416
01:40:11,226 --> 01:40:12,187
MATT: Yes.

1417
01:40:12,187 --> 01:40:16,402
LIAM: Because I can't remember for sure, didn't,
in our story somewhere, we come up with a solution

1418
01:40:16,402 --> 01:40:19,995
for Pike's noisiness? Something that quieted her
down?

1419
01:40:19,995 --> 01:40:21,681
LAURA: She had stealth boots.

1420
01:40:21,681 --> 01:40:26,146
MATT: Yes, her boots, they gave her advantage on
stealth, which meant that she just made a regular roll.

1421
01:40:26,146 --> 01:40:27,130
LIAM: Regular roll.

1422
01:40:27,130 --> 01:40:28,210
MATT: Yes.

1423
01:40:28,210 --> 01:40:31,176
MARISHA: We made her that armor that we never went
back and picked up because we fucked up.

1424
01:40:31,176 --> 01:40:33,466
LAURA: Yeah, but it doesn't matter because she's
got the Dawnmartyr.

1425
01:40:33,466 --> 01:40:37,378
LIAM: She casts Guidance on herself to help with
that roll.

1426
01:40:37,378 --> 01:40:41,071
TRAVIS: I'm with you. I think this thing has a
yield.

1427
01:40:41,071 --> 01:40:42,632
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm feeling it.

1428
01:40:42,632 --> 01:40:44,034
SAM: Break all the glass, go inside.

1429
01:40:44,034 --> 01:40:48,547
MARISHA: I touch the ground, still in my earth
elemental form, do I sense anything? Tremor sense?

1430
01:40:48,547 --> 01:40:50,080
Any vibrations?

1431
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:56,236
MATT: You feel for it. Nothing in the immediate vicinity.
However, another footfall hits from the titan and

1432
01:40:56,236 --> 01:41:01,336
it causes the entirety of the chamber to quake and
it's almost like, you know when Superman opens up

1433
01:41:01,336 --> 01:41:03,265
his perception too wide and hears all the voices?

1434
01:41:03,265 --> 01:41:04,526
MARISHA: Yep, mm-hmm.

1435
01:41:04,526 --> 01:41:09,926
MATT: Everything around you shakes with such an
intense ferocity, it causes your head to shake briefly.

1436
01:41:09,926 --> 01:41:12,267
LIAM: I have another DM question.

1437
01:41:12,267 --> 01:41:13,264
MATT: Yes.

1438
01:41:13,264 --> 01:41:17,032
LIAM: For paladins, "Until the end of your next
turn, you know the location of <i>any</i> undead within

1439
01:41:17,032 --> 01:41:19,522
"60 feet," so that implies number.

1440
01:41:19,522 --> 01:41:20,844
MATT: Correct.

1441
01:41:20,844 --> 01:41:23,520
LIAM: If I know the location of <i>any</i>, so how many
am I sensing?

1442
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:24,454
MATT: One.

1443
01:41:24,454 --> 01:41:27,008
LIAM: One. Okay.

1444
01:41:27,008 --> 01:41:28,709
LAURA: Do you know where? Can you sense where it
is?

1445
01:41:28,709 --> 01:41:30,423
MATT: It's in the center of this structure.

1446
01:41:30,423 --> 01:41:31,261
LIAM: Center.

1447
01:41:31,261 --> 01:41:32,607
TALIESIN: All right. Let's do this.

1448
01:41:32,607 --> 01:41:34,007
MARISHA: Oh. Okay.

1449
01:41:34,007 --> 01:41:35,470
LAURA: You want to fight it?

1450
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:37,534
TALIESIN: I bet there's something really nice
inside.

1451
01:41:37,534 --> 01:41:42,844
LIAM: Also, I mean, if Pike can get up and get a
peek in, she could take a first shot at turning

1452
01:41:42,844 --> 01:41:45,004
it. Turnt. Stay turnt.

1453
01:41:45,004 --> 01:41:50,609
MARISHA: So there are the double doors and then
it's a cave-in on one side?

1454
01:41:50,609 --> 01:41:56,477
MATT: On one side, and it's broken one of two sets
of stained glass on the front of it, and it seems

1455
01:41:56,477 --> 01:42:01,627
to have filled part of the interior. Currently,
there isn't enough space in that window to climb

1456
01:42:01,627 --> 01:42:05,173
in. It's filled with rock. You could try and move
stuff out of the way, or go through the doors, or

1457
01:42:05,173 --> 01:42:08,583
break the other windows. Those are the only types
of entrance you can find.

1458
01:42:08,583 --> 01:42:10,988
LAURA: And there's no other exit from this
cylindrical chamber?

1459
01:42:10,988 --> 01:42:12,387
MATT: That you see, no.

1460
01:42:12,387 --> 01:42:13,292
LAURA: Okay.

1461
01:42:13,292 --> 01:42:20,531
LIAM: I wonder if getting Pike on the broom or the
rug could improve her chances of sneaking up to

1462
01:42:20,531 --> 01:42:24,685
the door as well, and get a peek in, and try to
turn whatever's inside?

1463
01:42:24,685 --> 01:42:28,999
LAURA: Oh, I mean we could try it. I'll put Pike
on the broom.

1464
01:42:28,999 --> 01:42:30,044
LIAM: Okay.

1465
01:42:30,044 --> 01:42:34,273
LAURA: And we'll fly over to the side of the
cave-in?

1466
01:42:34,273 --> 01:42:39,108
MARISHA: I can just earth glide under and peek
up.

1467
01:42:39,108 --> 01:42:40,870
LAURA: Yeah, but she can turn undead.

1468
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:46,004
TRAVIS: But how many times can she do that in a
day? Is that a pull the trigger and once? Do we

1469
01:42:46,004 --> 01:42:47,792
want to waste it on something--

1470
01:42:47,792 --> 01:42:49,091
LAURA: As an action.

1471
01:42:49,091 --> 01:42:50,217
LIAM: Unlimited.

1472
01:42:50,217 --> 01:42:51,107
LAURA: As an action.

1473
01:42:51,107 --> 01:42:52,203
TRAVIS: Okay.

1474
01:42:52,203 --> 01:42:53,379
MATT: It's an action.

1475
01:42:53,379 --> 01:42:54,409
MARISHA: Is it a spell?

1476
01:42:54,409 --> 01:42:55,442
LIAM: No.

1477
01:42:55,442 --> 01:42:56,935
TRAVIS: I mean it could be an undead--

1478
01:42:56,935 --> 01:42:58,700
MATT: A Channel Divinity, is that what you're
talking about?

1479
01:42:58,700 --> 01:42:59,638
LAURA: Yeah.

1480
01:42:59,638 --> 01:43:00,874
TALIESIN: It just works.

1481
01:43:00,874 --> 01:43:06,610
LAURA: Oh wait, you can use your Channel Divinity
<i>twice</i> between rests.

1482
01:43:06,610 --> 01:43:11,767
LIAM: Okay, so she can do that. She's got a couple
of other things she can do with this ability.

1483
01:43:11,767 --> 01:43:13,169
LAURA: And is she 18th level?

1484
01:43:13,169 --> 01:43:14,211
LIAM: She's 18th level.

1485
01:43:14,211 --> 01:43:16,099
LAURA: Ooh, so now she can do it three times
between rests.

1486
01:43:16,099 --> 01:43:19,301
LIAM: It's worth a shot, because we could one-shot
a thing, possibly.

1487
01:43:19,301 --> 01:43:23,909
MATT: She's 17th right now-- oh no, I think she
just leveled up. I'll double check. No, because

1488
01:43:23,909 --> 01:43:25,049
<i>you</i> just hit 18th.

1489
01:43:25,049 --> 01:43:26,168
SAM: I just hit 18th.

1490
01:43:26,168 --> 01:43:27,416
MATT: Yep, so she's still 17th.

1491
01:43:27,416 --> 01:43:29,014
LIAM: Possible one shot.

1492
01:43:29,014 --> 01:43:30,991
TRAVIS: Might just be a dwarven king.

1493
01:43:30,991 --> 01:43:32,299
TALIESIN: Let's see what happens.

1494
01:43:32,299 --> 01:43:33,408
SAM: Let's do it.

1495
01:43:33,408 --> 01:43:34,491
MATT: Let me double check.

1496
01:43:34,491 --> 01:43:36,017
MARISHA: Probably is, he's just undead now.

1497
01:43:36,017 --> 01:43:38,187
LAURA: So we should try to get her in and turn
him?

1498
01:43:38,187 --> 01:43:39,099
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1499
01:43:39,099 --> 01:43:40,100
LAURA: Okay. Yeah, let's do that.

1500
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:46,250
TRAVIS: Or he's totally encased by the material
and if we unearth him--

1501
01:43:46,250 --> 01:43:47,526
MARISHA: It could be bad.

1502
01:43:47,526 --> 01:43:48,495
TRAVIS: Yep.

1503
01:43:48,495 --> 01:43:51,531
MARISHA: Or he's unearthed and-- yeah he could be
blocking a--

1504
01:43:51,531 --> 01:43:52,856
TRAVIS: Let sleeping dogs lie?

1505
01:43:52,856 --> 01:43:53,862
MARISHA: Yeah.

1506
01:43:53,862 --> 01:43:56,070
LAURA: Percy really wants to find treasure.

1507
01:43:56,070 --> 01:43:58,380
TALIESIN: Well, which is always a bad sign, but
there it is.

1508
01:43:58,380 --> 01:43:59,771
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's do this!

1509
01:43:59,771 --> 01:44:03,223
SAM: In what realm of possibility are we not going
into this thing?

1510
01:44:03,223 --> 01:44:07,668
LAURA: Well, we could just turn around and walk
away and find our way up to the city!

1511
01:44:07,668 --> 01:44:09,104
SAM: Have we ever done that?

1512
01:44:09,104 --> 01:44:10,365
TRAVIS: Go check that door before I do.

1513
01:44:10,365 --> 01:44:11,484
LAURA: All right.

1514
01:44:11,484 --> 01:44:13,242
LIAM: You guys go, everybody hang back.

1515
01:44:13,242 --> 01:44:14,066
TALIESIN: Check for traps!

1516
01:44:14,066 --> 01:44:15,529
LIAM: Yeah, do I spot anything? Here comes the
roll.

1517
01:44:15,529 --> 01:44:17,691
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, I'm going to cast Pass
Without A Trace on us now.

1518
01:44:17,691 --> 01:44:21,647
TALIESIN: I'm keeping my distance and pulling out
the rifle and I'm pointing, if anything needs

1519
01:44:21,647 --> 01:44:23,189
shooting, I'm going to shoot it.

1520
01:44:23,189 --> 01:44:24,477
MARISHA: I'm going to be with him by this door.

1521
01:44:24,477 --> 01:44:25,495
MATT: So you--?

1522
01:44:25,495 --> 01:44:27,655
LIAM: Checking for traps, investigation right?
20.

1523
01:44:27,655 --> 01:44:34,016
MATT: All right, so 20. As you go towards the
door, you can look around and see the door before

1524
01:44:34,016 --> 01:44:42,675
you. It's partially buried and it isn't locked,
but you can see there are some runic carvings

1525
01:44:42,675 --> 01:44:48,512
along the perimeter of the doorway, similar to
what you saw earlier on the pieces of stone when

1526
01:44:48,512 --> 01:44:52,949
you first entered, and there are signs of forced
entry. It looks like there are parts of the stone

1527
01:44:52,949 --> 01:44:57,998
that have been chipped, familiar to you from
people that use crowbars or other materials to

1528
01:44:57,998 --> 01:45:04,231
break into entry places. It looks like there have
been signs of forced entry in the past.

1529
01:45:04,231 --> 01:45:08,986
LIAM: However, there's still an undead thing
inside.

1530
01:45:08,986 --> 01:45:12,653
MARISHA: It could just be a fight? Deplete us
down.

1531
01:45:12,653 --> 01:45:14,094
LIAM: But I don't find any traps?

1532
01:45:14,094 --> 01:45:16,526
MATT: You do not find any traps in the door, no.

1533
01:45:16,526 --> 01:45:18,674
LAURA: It could just be a fight to take away our
stuff, before we go to a bigger fight.

1534
01:45:18,674 --> 01:45:19,763
MARISHA: Correct.

1535
01:45:19,763 --> 01:45:24,299
MATT: All you find is the door on the left appears
to be unlocked and you could possibly push it

1536
01:45:24,361 --> 01:45:28,326
open, and you see the dwarven writing on the
outside of the wall.

1537
01:45:28,326 --> 01:45:30,854
LIAM: (sighs)

1538
01:45:30,854 --> 01:45:33,487
MARISHA: Ah, come on. We're running out of time.

1539
01:45:33,487 --> 01:45:35,160
TRAVIS: What are we fucking pretending like--

1540
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:36,485
LAURA: Yeah, fine.

1541
01:45:36,485 --> 01:45:39,998
LIAM: Can we see, well, can Pike, "Can I see into
the hovel?"

1542
01:45:39,998 --> 01:45:42,475
MATT: Do you want to push the door open and have a
look inside?

1543
01:45:42,475 --> 01:45:43,626
LIAM: Oh, it's closed?

1544
01:45:43,626 --> 01:45:44,847
MATT: The door is closed, you can see--

1545
01:45:44,847 --> 01:45:49,765
TRAVIS: Oh, hold on, hold on. There are runes, of
which I can read.

1546
01:45:49,765 --> 01:45:52,576
MARISHA: Oh, five minutes go by, and--?

1547
01:45:52,576 --> 01:45:57,357
TRAVIS: Don't knock it, all right, just be
grateful. Can I try to take a look at the

1548
01:45:57,357 --> 01:45:58,214
Dwarvish?

1549
01:45:58,214 --> 01:45:59,161
MATT: You may.

1550
01:45:59,161 --> 01:46:00,032
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1551
01:46:00,032 --> 01:46:01,858
MATT: It takes you roughly 15 or so minutes.

1552
01:46:01,858 --> 01:46:06,802
LAURA: Oh my god, come on! We cannot wait for 15
minutes!

1553
01:46:06,802 --> 01:46:08,872
LIAM: Vax's wings go (poof).

1554
01:46:08,872 --> 01:46:11,613
MATT: Yeah, the wings vanish. You can take a short
rest if you guys would like to.

1555
01:46:11,613 --> 01:46:13,017
LAURA: While he's doing that?

1556
01:46:13,017 --> 01:46:14,126
TRAVIS: I'm Professor X.

1557
01:46:14,126 --> 01:46:16,239
MATT: It'll take a while, so it means you lose
your invisibility--

1558
01:46:16,239 --> 01:46:18,241
MARISHA: I mean, might as well.

1559
01:46:18,241 --> 01:46:24,290
MATT: All right so you guys can take your hit dice
as a short rest. Your form reverts, which if you

1560
01:46:24,290 --> 01:46:29,258
wanted to try and peek within, you couldn't anyway,
because it's worked stone so you can't glide through that.

1561
01:46:29,258 --> 01:46:38,274
The words you pull out from this are, "The
last king, stalwart warrior of our mountain

1562
01:46:38,274 --> 01:46:44,450
"secrets, his might unmatched, his will unbroken,
his passing invites the madness."

1563
01:46:44,450 --> 01:46:54,327
TRAVIS: Shit, okay, all right. It's been worth the
wait. It is the last king, there's like a secret

1564
01:46:54,327 --> 01:47:02,629
buried with him and his death brought on the
madness. So like, there's definitely treasure with

1565
01:47:02,629 --> 01:47:04,318
him down there.

1566
01:47:04,318 --> 01:47:06,394
MARISHA: Unless it's already been raided?

1567
01:47:06,394 --> 01:47:10,195
TALIESIN: I think he's still in there and he's
maybe been turning people mad.

1568
01:47:10,195 --> 01:47:12,495
That would be my guess.

1569
01:47:12,495 --> 01:47:13,645
LIAM: The last king.

1570
01:47:13,645 --> 01:47:14,734
SAM: There's a king in there?

1571
01:47:14,734 --> 01:47:15,973
LAURA: What, say it again?

1572
01:47:15,973 --> 01:47:20,095
TRAVIS: He's the last king, there's like, the
secret with--

1573
01:47:20,095 --> 01:47:22,313
MATT: "Stalwart warrior of our mountain secrets."

1574
01:47:22,313 --> 01:47:24,184
SAM: Mountain dwarf?

1575
01:47:24,184 --> 01:47:27,360
MARISHA: Stalwart warrior of our mountain
secrets.

1576
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:34,064
LIAM: "When I'm turning undead, if they're like
little piddly guys, they blow up, but if he's a

1577
01:47:34,064 --> 01:47:36,034
"king he might not blow up."

1578
01:47:36,034 --> 01:47:37,241
TALIESIN: Okay, then we can--

1579
01:47:37,241 --> 01:47:41,547
LIAM: "So he might get scared of me, or nothing,
I don't know?"

1580
01:47:41,547 --> 01:47:46,449
SAM: (laughs) Double Pike is the best Pike.

1581
01:47:46,449 --> 01:47:49,886
MATT: Grog, you do not get a short rest
unfortunately.

1582
01:47:49,886 --> 01:47:50,914
TRAVIS: Nope.

1583
01:47:50,914 --> 01:47:52,122
MATT: Because you were studying.

1584
01:47:52,122 --> 01:47:53,650
TRAVIS: Thank you. I'm working real hard.

1585
01:47:53,650 --> 01:47:59,451
SAM: Hey, for hit point counts here, I'm under the
impression that we had some bonus hit points from

1586
01:47:59,451 --> 01:48:03,018
some speech or something? Do we heal those as
well?

1587
01:48:03,018 --> 01:48:03,807
TALIESIN: No.

1588
01:48:03,807 --> 01:48:04,706
MARISHA: Yes.

1589
01:48:04,706 --> 01:48:05,602
TALIESIN: Oh, you do?

1590
01:48:05,602 --> 01:48:07,622
MARISHA: Yeah, it's plus 18 to your maximum hit
points.

1591
01:48:07,622 --> 01:48:10,471
MATT: No, no, no, that's from Heroes Feast.

1592
01:48:10,471 --> 01:48:11,968
SAM: Which we did not do.

1593
01:48:11,968 --> 01:48:15,619
MARISHA: Oh, I'm sorry, it's just temporary hit
points.

1594
01:48:15,619 --> 01:48:17,222
MATT: It's temporary hit points from your
speech.

1595
01:48:17,222 --> 01:48:22,094
MARISHA: But you don't get them back. Right,
right, okay.

1596
01:48:22,094 --> 01:48:23,745
TRAVIS: When they're gone, they're gone.

1597
01:48:23,745 --> 01:48:25,099
MARISHA: Then, yeah.

1598
01:48:25,099 --> 01:48:28,991
TRAVIS: What do you think, should we dig him up,
or move on?

1599
01:48:28,991 --> 01:48:33,233
SAM: Time is of the essence.

1600
01:48:33,233 --> 01:48:37,560
LIAM: "Well, time is of the essence, he could have
something useful. It seems like a coin flip."

1601
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:42,613
TRAVIS: It says he has a secret with him. Right?
Like a secret? A prize?

1602
01:48:42,613 --> 01:48:45,214
MATT: All it says is "stalwart warrior of our
mountain secrets".

1603
01:48:45,214 --> 01:48:47,485
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, a "'stow' of our mountain
secrets."

1604
01:48:47,485 --> 01:48:49,212
LIAM: "That's tempting," Liam said.

1605
01:48:49,212 --> 01:48:51,042
LAURA: You should open the door.

1606
01:48:51,042 --> 01:48:52,037
LIAM: Yeah, of course.

1607
01:48:52,037 --> 01:48:53,330
LAURA: <i>You</i> should open the door.

1608
01:48:53,330 --> 01:48:54,537
LIAM: Yeah, all right, so--

1609
01:48:54,537 --> 01:48:58,443
TALIESIN: We are nasty enough that if we have to
put this thing down, we put this thing down.

1610
01:48:58,443 --> 01:49:06,506
LIAM: Pickle, are you ready to go? "Yeah!" Okay,
shhh. I'm going to try and open it

1611
01:49:06,506 --> 01:49:07,780
as silent as possible.

1612
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:08,929
MATT: Make a strength check.

1613
01:49:08,929 --> 01:49:10,032
LIAM: <i>Strength</i> check?

1614
01:49:10,032 --> 01:49:11,131
MATT: It's a heavy stone door.

1615
01:49:11,131 --> 01:49:12,043
LIAM: Good grief.

1616
01:49:12,043 --> 01:49:14,995
MATT: Partially buried in rubble. It's not locked
but it is somewhat--

1617
01:49:14,995 --> 01:49:16,505
LIAM: 16.

1618
01:49:16,505 --> 01:49:17,466
MATT: 16?

1619
01:49:17,466 --> 01:49:18,380
LIAM: Yeah.

1620
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:20,764
MATT: For you? Is Pike helping?

1621
01:49:20,764 --> 01:49:21,617
LAURA: Yeah!

1622
01:49:21,617 --> 01:49:22,618
LIAM: Yeah, sure.

1623
01:49:22,618 --> 01:49:28,084
MATT: Have Pike roll as well. Her strength is 19
so it's +4 to what she rolls.

1624
01:49:28,084 --> 01:49:30,438
LAURA: 16.

1625
01:49:30,438 --> 01:49:37,820
MATT: Okay, you both (grunting). It shifts like a
quarter inch and then locks into place from

1626
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:38,734
something.

1627
01:49:38,734 --> 01:49:39,841
LIAM: Enough to see in?

1628
01:49:39,841 --> 01:49:41,240
MATT: No. The doors are about that thick.

1629
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:42,480
LIAM: "Grog--"

1630
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:45,823
TRAVIS: And I walk up and fucking hammer that
shit.

1631
01:49:45,823 --> 01:49:47,214
LAURA: No, Grog!!

1632
01:49:47,214 --> 01:49:51,124
LIAM: Pike goes like this (yells) as soon as the
door opens.

1633
01:49:51,124 --> 01:49:53,835
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll an attack.

1634
01:49:53,835 --> 01:49:55,006
TALIESIN: Titanstone Knuckles?

1635
01:49:55,006 --> 01:49:56,695
TRAVIS: Yeah. Double damage!

1636
01:49:56,695 --> 01:49:57,673
MARISHA: Yeah.

1637
01:49:57,673 --> 01:50:00,343
LIAM: I mean, as soon as Pike sees him flex, she's
got her hands--

1638
01:50:00,343 --> 01:50:01,641
LAURA: Ready to Turn Undead.

1639
01:50:01,641 --> 01:50:03,123
TRAVIS: 17.

1640
01:50:03,123 --> 01:50:07,257
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll damage.
We'll say 1d4 for your fists

1641
01:50:07,257 --> 01:50:08,697
plus your strength modifier.

1642
01:50:08,697 --> 01:50:11,506
TRAVIS: Ten!

1643
01:50:11,506 --> 01:50:16,348
MATT: Ten. So that's 20 points of damage, because
it's doubled. As you slam your fist into the stone

1644
01:50:16,348 --> 01:50:22,310
door, the door cracks and part of it
splinters and falls, toppling past your

1645
01:50:22,310 --> 01:50:27,240
shoulders and bouncing you in the head a bit. The door
suffered severe damage and probably wouldn't

1646
01:50:27,240 --> 01:50:28,535
sustain another blow.

1647
01:50:28,535 --> 01:50:31,009
MARISHA: I mean--

1648
01:50:31,009 --> 01:50:32,182
TALIESIN: Go ahead.

1649
01:50:32,182 --> 01:50:34,435
TRAVIS: Fee fi fo fum!

1650
01:50:34,435 --> 01:50:36,350
MATT: (laughs) Roll an attack again.

1651
01:50:36,350 --> 01:50:40,902
TRAVIS: That is a 15.

1652
01:50:40,902 --> 01:50:44,752
MATT: 15, yeah, that's enough. That's just enough.
You slam a second time, you don't have to roll

1653
01:50:44,752 --> 01:50:48,930
damage. Even with the additional modifier it's
enough. The door (crumbling) crumples inward and

1654
01:50:48,930 --> 01:50:55,304
falls inside the actual chamber as your fist turns
it into shattered rock and dust.

1655
01:50:55,304 --> 01:50:57,753
LAURA: Can Pike see undead in there?

1656
01:50:57,753 --> 01:50:59,336
MATT: Make a perception check.

1657
01:50:59,336 --> 01:51:02,586
TRAVIS: I'll make a perception check too. I'm at
the doorway.

1658
01:51:02,586 --> 01:51:06,452
LAURA: Plus 11? 20.

1659
01:51:06,452 --> 01:51:07,827
MATT: Okay.

1660
01:51:07,827 --> 01:51:09,175
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

1661
01:51:09,175 --> 01:51:12,852
MATT: Okay, as you guys glance inside briefly this
ten-foot wide-- well, it's actually more like a

1662
01:51:12,852 --> 01:51:20,649
six-foot wide door side on this point, glancing
inside it's another circular chamber that's like

1663
01:51:20,649 --> 01:51:26,795
an outer hallway maybe five feet wide, six feet
wide, and an interior chamber. It looks like a

1664
01:51:26,795 --> 01:51:30,702
smaller cylinder on the inside that is currently
locked. You don't see anything within there. You

1665
01:51:30,702 --> 01:51:35,596
see to the right immediately the rockslide has
filled most of the chamber and comes to rest just

1666
01:51:35,596 --> 01:51:50,158
about the corner of a single large antique bronze
door that's pushed into this central chamber about

1667
01:51:50,158 --> 01:51:51,506
15 feet wide.

1668
01:51:51,506 --> 01:51:53,663
LIAM: Vax catches Pike's shoulder. Hold on, let me
look.

1669
01:51:53,663 --> 01:51:59,358
MATT: You glance off to your left and you can see
along the other side, there are five pedestals

1670
01:51:59,358 --> 01:52:07,847
that curve around this side, each containing a
stone box about that big, on each pedestal.

1671
01:52:07,847 --> 01:52:09,209
TALIESIN: What?!

1672
01:52:09,209 --> 01:52:15,614
MATT: Otherwise, all around the ground here are
broken rocks and shattered statue bits from the

1673
01:52:15,614 --> 01:52:24,108
rockslide. They pushed it inside. It's a mess
across the ground from the impact of the

1674
01:52:24,108 --> 01:52:27,391
rockslide. So, what are you guys doing?

1675
01:52:27,391 --> 01:52:29,909
LIAM: I'm checking the boxes for traps. And the
door.

1676
01:52:29,909 --> 01:52:33,075
LAURA: Can we see anything that points to what
deity it is from inside the chamber? Can we see

1677
01:52:33,075 --> 01:52:34,044
anything?

1678
01:52:34,044 --> 01:52:40,913
MATT: Glancing around? You can't make another
religion check on one you've already failed.

1679
01:52:40,913 --> 01:52:42,115
LAURA: Oh, yeah, no.

1680
01:52:42,115 --> 01:52:44,641
MATT: So you don't see anything that comes across
as religious iconography.

1681
01:52:44,641 --> 01:52:46,834
LAURA: What about Pike though, because she's
looking in.

1682
01:52:46,834 --> 01:52:48,546
MATT: Sure, make a religion check for Pike.

1683
01:52:48,546 --> 01:52:51,272
TALIESIN: Feel you. I feel you.

1684
01:52:51,272 --> 01:52:52,458
LIAM: Plus seven.

1685
01:52:52,458 --> 01:52:53,965
LAURA: 13.

1686
01:52:53,965 --> 01:52:58,731
MATT: 13? No religious iconography seems to catch
your attention. What did you roll for the--?

1687
01:52:58,731 --> 01:53:00,836
LIAM: 19 for the investigation.

1688
01:53:00,836 --> 01:53:02,356
MATT: 19 for the investigation.

1689
01:53:02,356 --> 01:53:03,610
LIAM: The door and boxes.

1690
01:53:03,610 --> 01:53:07,328
MATT: Okay. Glancing at the first box, it does not
appear to be locked. It does

1691
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:08,324
appear to be trapped.

1692
01:53:08,324 --> 01:53:11,503
LIAM: Okay. Here we go.

1693
01:53:11,503 --> 01:53:14,196
LAURA: You're going to try to undo the trap?

1694
01:53:14,196 --> 01:53:18,123
MATT: Yep, so go ahead and make a roll, your
dexterity and your proficiency modifier.

1695
01:53:18,123 --> 01:53:20,746
LIAM: Thieves' tool, yeah. That's fine.

1696
01:53:20,746 --> 01:53:23,271
TRAVIS: Should we clear out of here while you work
on this bomb?

1697
01:53:23,271 --> 01:53:24,861
LIAM: Yeah!

1698
01:53:24,861 --> 01:53:26,981
TRAVIS: We're all going to get out of the
chamber.

1699
01:53:26,981 --> 01:53:28,881
MATT: Okay, so you all clear out of the chamber.

1700
01:53:28,881 --> 01:53:29,824
LIAM: 30.

1701
01:53:29,824 --> 01:53:35,228
MATT: 30, okay. You find there's actually a pressure
cartridge at the very top of the box, so you slip

1702
01:53:35,228 --> 01:53:40,813
your dagger in, so it remains depressed. As you
lift the lid, you put your thumb over it and hold

1703
01:53:40,813 --> 01:53:43,834
it, trap never triggers. Looking inside, it's
empty.

1704
01:53:43,834 --> 01:53:46,857
LIAM: (shutting noise)

1705
01:53:46,857 --> 01:53:48,300
MATT: (shutting noise) No problem.

1706
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:50,251
LIAM: Just go down the line.

1707
01:53:50,251 --> 01:53:52,331
MATT: All right. Investigation check on the next
one.

1708
01:53:52,331 --> 01:53:54,115
TRAVIS: Five of them, on pedestals.

1709
01:53:54,115 --> 01:53:58,126
LAURA: (groans) Luck?

1710
01:53:58,126 --> 01:53:59,106
LIAM: Yeah.

1711
01:53:59,106 --> 01:54:00,144
LAURA: Okay, good.

1712
01:54:00,144 --> 01:54:01,018
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

1713
01:54:01,018 --> 01:54:03,606
LIAM: (laughs) That's a 29.

1714
01:54:03,606 --> 01:54:04,713
MATT: You rolled a 29?

1715
01:54:04,713 --> 01:54:05,736
LIAM: With Luck.

1716
01:54:05,736 --> 01:54:07,010
MATT: Okay, this one is not locked, is trapped.

1717
01:54:07,010 --> 01:54:13,023
LIAM: Okay, here we go. That's fine. That's a 27.

1718
01:54:13,023 --> 01:54:19,235
MATT: 27, okay. Similar depression plate, so the
dagger opens it up. It's empty.

1719
01:54:19,235 --> 01:54:23,414
LIAM: I did one, two, let's jump to five.

1720
01:54:23,414 --> 01:54:25,318
MATT: Okay, go for it.

1721
01:54:25,318 --> 01:54:29,972
LAURA: Are you making sure nothing's invisible in
there?

1722
01:54:29,972 --> 01:54:36,307
LIAM: No. Are you here?

1723
01:54:36,307 --> 01:54:38,078
LAURA: I'm peeking in the door.

1724
01:54:38,078 --> 01:54:39,425
LIAM: Did you whisper it to me?

1725
01:54:39,425 --> 01:54:40,427
LAURA: Yeah.

1726
01:54:40,427 --> 01:54:42,285
LIAM: They don't relock when I go?

1727
01:54:42,285 --> 01:54:43,768
LAURA: They're not locking.

1728
01:54:43,768 --> 01:54:48,537
LIAM: My sister's hounding me at the door, so I'm
going to go back and twiddle my finger inside the

1729
01:54:48,537 --> 01:54:49,701
empty boxes.

1730
01:54:49,701 --> 01:54:52,251
LAURA: You were shutting them as you went.

1731
01:54:52,251 --> 01:54:54,680
LIAM: Yeah, but I can reopen them. They don't
relock, do they?

1732
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:56,680
LAURA: It's not that they were locked. They were
trapped.

1733
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:57,856
LIAM: But retrap, I mean?

1734
01:54:57,856 --> 01:54:59,520
MATT: They are re-trapped but you've already known
the traps--

1735
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:01,526
LIAM: So I'll go do this inside.

1736
01:55:01,526 --> 01:55:03,122
MATT: Nothing.

1737
01:55:03,122 --> 01:55:05,239
LAURA: Just wanted to double check!

1738
01:55:05,239 --> 01:55:07,927
LIAM: I go to box five.

1739
01:55:07,927 --> 01:55:08,959
MATT: Okay.

1740
01:55:08,959 --> 01:55:15,698
LIAM: Oh, that's great. Yeah, that works. That was
investigation and it's 26?

1741
01:55:15,698 --> 01:55:19,637
MATT: 26? It's not locked. It is trapped.

1742
01:55:19,637 --> 01:55:27,642
LIAM: That is a 33? Yeah.

1743
01:55:27,642 --> 01:55:33,190
MATT: 33. Similar trap setup, different placement
of the depression plate on the inside of the box

1744
01:55:33,190 --> 01:55:36,132
lid. You find it, hold it, open it up. Empty.

1745
01:55:36,132 --> 01:55:38,363
LAURA: Ah, it's all empty?

1746
01:55:38,363 --> 01:55:39,771
TALIESIN: Two more.

1747
01:55:39,771 --> 01:55:40,800
LIAM: Two more.

1748
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:45,126
LIAM: Let's go to box number three. There's three
and four left.

1749
01:55:45,126 --> 01:55:46,202
MATT: Okay.

1750
01:55:46,202 --> 01:55:50,900
LAURA: I look over at Percy. It makes me far too
uncomfortable how excited you are about this.

1751
01:55:50,900 --> 01:55:52,720
TALIESIN: This could be very good.

1752
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:53,919
LIAM: 18.

1753
01:55:53,919 --> 01:55:57,979
MATT: 18. All right, you check. It is not locked.
It is not trapped.

1754
01:55:57,979 --> 01:55:59,341
(groaning)

1755
01:55:59,341 --> 01:56:01,648
LAURA: Oh no, oh no, you rolled too low!

1756
01:56:01,648 --> 01:56:05,730
MATT: Okay, you lift the lid, putting the
dagger where the other depressions were.

1757
01:56:05,730 --> 01:56:07,168
LIAM: I'm leaning back.

1758
01:56:07,168 --> 01:56:12,221
MATT: As you pull it back, there's a (cloud
explosion) of a purplish-black cloud of some sort

1759
01:56:12,221 --> 01:56:15,672
of vapor that immediately bursts into your face.
Make a constitution saving throw.

1760
01:56:15,672 --> 01:56:19,732
LAURA: It's okay. Well, it's not okay. He's got
better constitution.

1761
01:56:19,732 --> 01:56:21,784
LIAM: Good. 20.

1762
01:56:21,784 --> 01:56:28,046
MATT: 20. You manage to just in time hold your
breath and what bit gets into your lungs your body

1763
01:56:28,046 --> 01:56:36,683
instinctually pushes against. Your semi-living
form pushes the toxins from your system.

1764
01:56:36,683 --> 01:56:39,215
You only suffer--

1765
01:56:39,215 --> 01:56:43,426
LAURA: 75 points of poison damage.

1766
01:56:43,426 --> 01:56:45,142
MATT: No, you only suffer eight points of poison
damage.

1767
01:56:45,142 --> 01:56:46,429
TALIESIN: Ah, there you go.

1768
01:56:46,429 --> 01:56:47,946
LIAM: Let's do one more.

1769
01:56:47,946 --> 01:56:49,238
TALIESIN: Anything in the box?

1770
01:56:49,238 --> 01:56:50,623
MATT: Box is empty.

1771
01:56:50,623 --> 01:56:52,041
TALIESIN: Last box!

1772
01:56:52,041 --> 01:56:54,587
TRAVIS: You are not doing this to us!

1773
01:56:54,587 --> 01:57:00,484
LIAM: 19.

1774
01:57:00,484 --> 01:57:02,284
MATT: 19. Not locked, not trapped.

1775
01:57:02,284 --> 01:57:03,927
TALIESIN: Hold your breath.

1776
01:57:03,927 --> 01:57:05,511
TRAVIS: Look at his eyes! Look at his eyes!

1777
01:57:05,511 --> 01:57:13,041
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to hold my breath and--
wait, wait, wait.

1778
01:57:13,041 --> 01:57:16,992
SAM: Need some help in there?

1779
01:57:16,992 --> 01:57:22,787
LIAM: Okay, here's what I'm going to do. I 
take up Whisper and I go (unlocking)

1780
01:57:22,787 --> 01:57:24,482
(wind blowing) and throw it at the wall.

1781
01:57:24,482 --> 01:57:26,983
MATT: Okay. So you throw Whisper and pull the lid
up?

1782
01:57:26,983 --> 01:57:27,930
LIAM: Yep.

1783
01:57:27,930 --> 01:57:32,533
MATT: As you pull the lid up, (trap triggers) the
same toxic fume emanates from it but you are not

1784
01:57:32,533 --> 01:57:39,339
there in the space, instead appearing right next to the
central cylindrical platform in the center of the

1785
01:57:39,339 --> 01:57:44,087
chamber and look back and the cloud slowly
dissipates around. The lid has now fallen back

1786
01:57:44,087 --> 01:57:45,236
into place.

1787
01:57:45,236 --> 01:57:46,346
TRAVIS: Aw, shit!

1788
01:57:46,346 --> 01:57:47,484
MARISHA: That was hot.

1789
01:57:47,484 --> 01:57:49,484
LIAM: I walk over to it (finger swirling sound).

1790
01:57:49,484 --> 01:57:51,026
MATT: Well, the lid fell back in place.

1791
01:57:51,026 --> 01:57:55,314
LIAM: Oh, I did that to the top! I open it up
(finger swirling sound).

1792
01:57:55,314 --> 01:57:56,668
MATT: Okay, you open it up. Make a constitution
saving throw.

1793
01:57:56,668 --> 01:57:57,751
LIAM: Yes!

1794
01:57:57,751 --> 01:57:59,560
MATT: As it (cloud explosion) sprays in the air--

1795
01:57:59,560 --> 01:58:01,722
LIAM: It does it again?! It didn't expend?!

1796
01:58:01,722 --> 01:58:03,806
MATT: These don't!

1797
01:58:03,806 --> 01:58:08,904
LIAM: I would've thought there'd be a little
container--

1798
01:58:08,904 --> 01:58:11,482
MATT: They reset when they close!

1799
01:58:11,482 --> 01:58:14,825
LIAM: With what?! Are there a bunch of gnomes down
there?!

1800
01:58:14,825 --> 01:58:16,469
TALIESIN: It's like a paintball gun.

1801
01:58:16,469 --> 01:58:21,990
MATT: It's like there's magic in the world,
Liam, that allows you to fly 400 feet a round!

1802
01:58:21,990 --> 01:58:25,390
LIAM: I'm just going to take it, a 14, that's not
good enough.

1803
01:58:25,390 --> 01:58:27,640
MATT: No, it's not good enough-- Oh! No, actually
14 is just what you needed.

1804
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:28,713
LAURA: Oh!

1805
01:58:28,713 --> 01:58:34,836
MATT: So, you resist it again (pained noise), you
still-- That is only six points of poison damage.

1806
01:58:34,836 --> 01:58:37,955
LIAM: I'm fine, I'm fine, I cough.

1807
01:58:37,955 --> 01:58:40,988
MATT: But you resist the poison from locking into
your system.

1808
01:58:40,988 --> 01:58:42,248
LAURA: That's good.

1809
01:58:42,248 --> 01:58:43,614
MATT: The box is empty.

1810
01:58:43,614 --> 01:58:45,706
LAURA: The box is empty! Was it worth it?

1811
01:58:45,779 --> 01:58:47,597
TALIESIN: What's in the center?

1812
01:58:47,597 --> 01:58:50,503
LIAM: I feel alive-- of what? Of the room?

1813
01:58:50,503 --> 01:58:53,662
MATT: The bronze door.

1814
01:58:53,662 --> 01:58:56,699
SAM: The gift was the adventure.

1815
01:58:56,699 --> 01:59:00,627
TALIESIN: I think that's where the good shit was.
I think this was just to take people out.

1816
01:59:00,627 --> 01:59:04,966
MATT: You get the sense looking around here, based
on the forced entry, that there's probably a good

1817
01:59:04,966 --> 01:59:08,134
chance this place had already been pilfered of
whatever those boxes contained.

1818
01:59:08,134 --> 01:59:12,397
LIAM: You never know. They could've died trying.
And then walked away undead.

1819
01:59:12,397 --> 01:59:14,601
SAM: So, there's literally nothing in here? Or
there's still a sarcophagus?

1820
01:59:14,601 --> 01:59:16,625
LAURA: There's a center cylinder.

1821
01:59:16,625 --> 01:59:21,143
MATT: There's the rockslide, shattered statues
across the ground. There's the empty boxes on the

1822
01:59:21,143 --> 01:59:23,217
pillars, and there's the bronze doorway.

1823
01:59:23,217 --> 01:59:28,035
LAURA: There is an undead thing, maybe one undead
guy got stuck in the middle.

1824
01:59:28,035 --> 01:59:31,348
SAM: So, we should open the bronze door? Right?

1825
01:59:31,348 --> 01:59:32,300
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1826
01:59:32,300 --> 01:59:35,545
LAURA: You know what, Scanlan, you should probably
bamf inside and see.

1827
01:59:35,545 --> 01:59:36,520
SAM: I could.

1828
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:37,630
TRAVIS: Do it.

1829
01:59:37,630 --> 01:59:38,457
SAM: Okay.

1830
01:59:38,457 --> 01:59:39,582
LAURA: No, no, I'm joking!

1831
01:59:39,582 --> 01:59:40,830
TRAVIS: No, no, no, do it!

1832
01:59:40,830 --> 01:59:43,755
SAM: I'll go inside and I'll open the door!

1833
01:59:43,755 --> 01:59:44,646
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1834
01:59:44,646 --> 01:59:46,622
TALIESIN: The door just opens on it--

1835
01:59:46,622 --> 01:59:49,064
SAM: Is it locked?

1836
01:59:49,064 --> 01:59:51,310
MATT: You go ahead and inspect the door?

1837
01:59:51,310 --> 01:59:52,363
LIAM: Ask your rogue, dude.

1838
01:59:52,363 --> 02:00:01,241
MATT: So, as you go and take a moment and check
the door, there is a bronze image faintly carved

1839
02:00:01,241 --> 02:00:05,750
into it of a stocky dwarven man with a thick beard
that touches his toes. It completely covers the

1840
02:00:05,750 --> 02:00:12,530
front of his body. He wears plated armor that
comes to dangerous, jagged, curved-up points. As

1841
02:00:12,530 --> 02:00:19,415
far as dwarves go, this one looks about as unhappy
and unapproachable as any dwarf, and you've

1842
02:00:19,415 --> 02:00:25,720
encountered some pretty gnarly dwarves in your
time. As you glance down, there does appear to be

1843
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:35,591
an opening for a key and there is an oval turning
mechanism, like a vault door,

1844
02:00:35,591 --> 02:00:36,948
like a smaller vault.

1845
02:00:36,948 --> 02:00:38,337
SAM: I'm going to check for traps.

1846
02:00:38,337 --> 02:00:40,541
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1847
02:00:40,541 --> 02:00:45,724
SAM: I think it's 20.

1848
02:00:45,724 --> 02:00:48,278
MATT: 20? It does not appear to be trapped.

1849
02:00:48,278 --> 02:00:50,640
TRAVIS: Look at that face.

1850
02:00:50,640 --> 02:00:52,668
LIAM: Do you mind if I give a second opinion?

1851
02:00:52,668 --> 02:00:53,941
SAM: Sure.

1852
02:00:53,941 --> 02:01:01,067
LIAM: You know, what could it hurt? Oh, not that good
though. No, lower than what you rolled.

1853
02:01:01,067 --> 02:01:04,378
LAURA: Oh shit. There's no traps.

1854
02:01:04,378 --> 02:01:05,893
LIAM: It's okay, you're good now.

1855
02:01:05,893 --> 02:01:07,236
TRAVIS: We need a key though.

1856
02:01:07,236 --> 02:01:10,351
MATT: Does appear to be locked, though.

1857
02:01:10,351 --> 02:01:16,974
SAM: Oh yeah, maybe you should pick the lock.

1858
02:01:16,974 --> 02:01:19,394
TRAVIS: We need a key. Let me try my--

1859
02:01:19,394 --> 02:01:21,520
LAURA: No, let's just pick his for this.

1860
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:23,615
LIAM: Natural 20.

1861
02:01:23,615 --> 02:01:25,881
MATT: To?

1862
02:01:25,881 --> 02:01:27,169
LIAM: Pick it.

1863
02:01:27,169 --> 02:01:28,628
MATT: Pick the lock? Okay.

1864
02:01:28,628 --> 02:01:30,312
LAURA: I'm not in this room.

1865
02:01:30,312 --> 02:01:31,952
TALIESIN: I'm in the back, ready.

1866
02:01:31,952 --> 02:01:34,288
LIAM: Pike is, though. She's been doing this for
five minutes.

1867
02:01:34,288 --> 02:01:36,085
MATT: Okay, so you and Pike, you're in the back of
the room.

1868
02:01:36,085 --> 02:01:37,489
TALIESIN: I'm right by the door.

1869
02:01:37,489 --> 02:01:38,672
MATT: What's everyone doing?

1870
02:01:38,672 --> 02:01:40,000
TRAVIS and LAURA: Outside the door.

1871
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,944
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm outside, waiting for a call.

1872
02:01:42,944 --> 02:01:44,118
SAM: I'm right next to him.

1873
02:01:44,118 --> 02:01:47,152
MATT: All right. So it's a total of what?

1874
02:01:47,152 --> 02:01:54,839
LIAM: Total of 37. I'm a level 18 rogue!

1875
02:01:54,839 --> 02:01:56,220
MATT: I know!

1876
02:01:56,220 --> 02:01:57,675
TALIESIN: Who just rolled a natural 20!

1877
02:01:57,675 --> 02:02:08,832
MATT: On a lockpick DC of 30, you manage to
somehow find the intricacy of a king dwarf

1878
02:02:08,832 --> 02:02:15,982
sarcophagus sealed door. It takes you a good two
to three minutes to carefully find the proper

1879
02:02:15,982 --> 02:02:24,487
tumblers and hold them without it breaking or
ruining the lock, but you manage to feel something

1880
02:02:24,487 --> 02:02:34,489
shift, and a slight latch mechanism on the other
side go (creaking). At which point, the brass door

1881
02:02:34,489 --> 02:02:42,200
from the front door's jaw goes (door opening) and
pours forth this green fume that fills the entirety of

1882
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:48,911
the chamber. Scanlan, Pike, and Vax, I need you
and you because you're still in

1883
02:02:48,911 --> 02:02:49,920
the back of the chamber--

1884
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:51,245
TALIESIN: I'm by the door though.

1885
02:02:51,245 --> 02:02:52,801
LIAM: But you're inside.

1886
02:02:52,801 --> 02:02:56,579
MATT: You said you were back in the chamber by the
door, it's on the outskirt. I need you all to make

1887
02:02:56,579 --> 02:02:58,601
a constitution saving throw, please.

1888
02:02:58,601 --> 02:03:01,580
TRAVIS: It's like we kept asking for it.

1889
02:03:01,580 --> 02:03:03,087
MARISHA: I know.

1890
02:03:03,087 --> 02:03:04,840
SAM: 18, for me.

1891
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:09,939
MARISHA: Keyleth is in the back facepalming right
about now.

1892
02:03:09,939 --> 02:03:11,243
TALIESIN: 19.

1893
02:03:11,243 --> 02:03:13,373
LIAM: 25.

1894
02:03:13,373 --> 02:03:14,679
MATT: Okay.

1895
02:03:14,679 --> 02:03:16,112
LAURA: Seven.

1896
02:03:16,112 --> 02:03:24,190
MATT: Seven. Okay. You manage to shrug off
whatever this effect the fume is and you all cough

1897
02:03:24,190 --> 02:03:31,173
for a second as it dissipates. Scanlan, Percival,
and Pike, you feel your joints begin to stiffen,

1898
02:03:31,173 --> 02:03:35,656
you feel your skin begin to tighten, and as you
guys try and shift and look around, your whole

1899
02:03:35,656 --> 02:03:45,598
body moves sluggishly. The outside of your body
seems to harden and begin to shift in place. You

1900
02:03:45,598 --> 02:03:49,902
suddenly begin to wonder, those shattered statue
pieces in the ground may have been the last tomb

1901
02:03:49,902 --> 02:03:57,075
robbers who came through here. As you all begin to
realize this and the fume begins to slowly fade

1902
02:03:57,075 --> 02:04:01,326
from the chamber, the rest of you, scared to
enter, I need you to make another constitution

1903
02:04:01,326 --> 02:04:02,640
saving throw.

1904
02:04:02,640 --> 02:04:03,701
TRAVIS: Whoa.

1905
02:04:03,701 --> 02:04:04,805
LAURA: Oh my god.

1906
02:04:04,805 --> 02:04:09,227
MATT: Not you, Vax, you've already made it, but I
need Pike, Percy, and Scanlan to make another.

1907
02:04:09,227 --> 02:04:12,289
MARISHA: Can Keyleth do any type of wind gust to
try and push this away to help?

1908
02:04:12,289 --> 02:04:13,611
MATT: If you'd like to.

1909
02:04:13,611 --> 02:04:15,041
MARISHA: But ahead of time?

1910
02:04:15,041 --> 02:04:18,856
MATT: The effect has already taken place on them,
it's not going to stop it unless they save, but

1911
02:04:18,856 --> 02:04:20,442
you can try and clear the chamber of the fume.

1912
02:04:20,442 --> 02:04:22,529
MARISHA: I'll go ahead and clear the chamber so
they don't have to do this again.

1913
02:04:22,529 --> 02:04:23,954
MATT: All right, so what are you using to do
that?

1914
02:04:23,954 --> 02:04:25,410
MARISHA: Wind gust.

1915
02:04:25,410 --> 02:04:26,694
MATT: It's a 1st-level, correct?

1916
02:04:26,694 --> 02:04:32,331
MATT: So you clear, the fume dissipates out and up
into the chamber, and you diffuse it enough where

1917
02:04:32,331 --> 02:04:34,602
it doesn't seem to have as concentrated an
effect.

1918
02:04:34,602 --> 02:04:40,236
LIAM: Could you say that Vax saw the look of panic
in Pike's eyes and Blessed her in a split second?

1919
02:04:40,236 --> 02:04:42,540
MARISHA: Gust of Wind, 2nd-level spell, sorry.

1920
02:04:42,540 --> 02:04:45,837
MATT: I will say, sure, I'll let that happen.

1921
02:04:45,837 --> 02:04:49,062
SAM: But you won't let me cast Greater
Restoration?

1922
02:04:49,062 --> 02:04:51,733
MATT: You can if you want to.

1923
02:04:51,733 --> 02:04:55,741
SAM: I will cast Greater Restoration.

1924
02:04:55,741 --> 02:04:57,030
MATT: On yourself?

1925
02:04:57,030 --> 02:04:58,091
SAM: On Pike.

1926
02:04:58,091 --> 02:05:03,279
MATT: On Pike, okay. As you reach out and cast
Greater Restoration, it infuses Pike's body and

1927
02:05:03,279 --> 02:05:05,264
the hardening effect fades.

1928
02:05:05,264 --> 02:05:10,737
SAM: But I have to roll another constitution?

1929
02:05:10,737 --> 02:05:12,379
MATT: You and Percival both.

1930
02:05:12,379 --> 02:05:13,672
LAURA: So Pike is--?

1931
02:05:13,672 --> 02:05:14,807
SAM: 13.

1932
02:05:14,807 --> 02:05:18,418
MARISHA: 13 is not good. Oh, fucking hell.

1933
02:05:18,418 --> 02:05:28,327
TALIESIN: I'm going to blow a Resolve. That'll be
fun, because that was bullshit. 18?

1934
02:05:28,327 --> 02:05:36,286
MATT: As Pike shrugs off the effect and the Gust
of Wind clears the rest of the green fume from the

1935
02:05:36,286 --> 02:05:44,301
chamber, you all look back and watch as, locked in
place, frozen stone Percival and Scanlan now adorn

1936
02:05:44,301 --> 02:05:47,928
the chamber like decorative statues, locked in an
expression of--

1937
02:05:47,928 --> 02:05:50,746
LAURA: Pike runs over and casts Greater
Restoration on Scanlan.

1938
02:05:50,746 --> 02:05:53,195
MARISHA: And I cast Greater Restoration on Percy.

1939
02:05:53,195 --> 02:05:56,625
MATT: Okay, so mark off those spells cast for both
of you. And upon touch, each of you, your form

1940
02:05:56,625 --> 02:06:00,302
reverts back and the flesh and color returns 
to your body.

1941
02:06:00,302 --> 02:06:05,986
MARISHA: Can we please stop robbing tombs and get
back to our actual mission?

1942
02:06:05,986 --> 02:06:07,364
SAM: I'm stuck like this!

1943
02:06:07,364 --> 02:06:08,423
LAURA: No, you're not.

1944
02:06:08,423 --> 02:06:10,179
SAM: It didn't work! Oh god!

1945
02:06:10,179 --> 02:06:11,809
LAURA: Scanlan, no you're not.

1946
02:06:11,809 --> 02:06:13,455
TALIESIN: I put my finger in his ear.

1947
02:06:13,455 --> 02:06:15,606
TRAVIS: Shit, we just blew those.

1948
02:06:15,606 --> 02:06:16,931
MARISHA: Can we go?

1949
02:06:16,931 --> 02:06:24,313
MATT: The door's open. And the jaw is not
resetting. It's expended at the time, you don't

1950
02:06:24,313 --> 02:06:29,007
know how long it will take for it to reset. And
you do recognize this is one of those type of

1951
02:06:29,007 --> 02:06:33,378
traps that does reset over time, you just don't know
how much time you have.

1952
02:06:33,378 --> 02:06:35,497
LIAM: Too bad I didn't recognize the last one.

1953
02:06:35,497 --> 02:06:36,638
MATT: Nope.

1954
02:06:36,638 --> 02:06:38,462
TALIESIN: Do we want to open it? We paid for it.

1955
02:06:38,462 --> 02:06:39,453
LIAM: It's open.

1956
02:06:39,453 --> 02:06:40,746
TALIESIN: It's open, what's inside?

1957
02:06:40,746 --> 02:06:41,924
LIAM: Pickle, come on.

1958
02:06:41,924 --> 02:06:43,214
LAURA: She gets ready.

1959
02:06:43,214 --> 02:06:49,597
MATT: Beyond the door, indeed you find the tomb of
the last king. In this cylindrical chamber with

1960
02:06:49,597 --> 02:06:56,002
plain stone walls in the center, you see a single
solid marble rectangular sarcophagus with no lid.

1961
02:06:56,002 --> 02:07:02,674
It is open before you. Within, you see the
mummified skeleton of a dwarf adorned in golden

1962
02:07:02,674 --> 02:07:06,937
decorative armor, the same shape and design that
you saw on the bronze doorway before you entered.

1963
02:07:06,937 --> 02:07:13,145
An intricate hammer made of jet black metal rests
to one side outside of its grasp, and a beautiful

1964
02:07:13,145 --> 02:07:19,189
gray leather belt of square opals wraps around the
center of its body. At which point, the skull goes

1965
02:07:19,189 --> 02:07:20,509
(crackling).

1966
02:07:20,509 --> 02:07:21,932
LAURA: She casts Turn Undead.

1967
02:07:21,932 --> 02:07:24,468
LIAM: She grabs her holy symbol and flips it the
bird and Turns Undead.

1968
02:07:24,468 --> 02:07:30,129
MATT: Okay. As she holds up the holy symbol, the
might of Sarenrae swells within her and blasts

1969
02:07:30,129 --> 02:07:35,876
forth in a shockwave of divine energy and will.
What's her DC?

1970
02:07:35,876 --> 02:07:40,254
LIAM: Wisdom saving throw DC, oh shit, so many
pieces of paper. 18.

1971
02:07:40,254 --> 02:07:48,511
MATT: 18? As the wave blasts past, it sits up,
seemingly unaffected by the effect. (growls) It

1972
02:07:48,511 --> 02:07:54,230
looks like it's coming to. You have one round.
What are you guys doing?

1973
02:07:54,230 --> 02:07:55,550
LIAM: One round?

1974
02:07:55,550 --> 02:07:56,729
TRAVIS: We're not in there.

1975
02:07:56,729 --> 02:08:00,847
MATT: Nope, the rest of you are out. It's one
round before it seems to be-- it's currently

1976
02:08:00,847 --> 02:08:04,403
sitting up in the sarcophagus, its arms reaching
out for the hammer at its side.

1977
02:08:04,403 --> 02:08:08,411
LIAM: I'm going to fill up with three daggers and
dump Divine Smite into the first.

1978
02:08:08,411 --> 02:08:09,890
SAM: Take its weapons.

1979
02:08:09,890 --> 02:08:13,266
MATT: All right. Pike also still has her mace.

1980
02:08:13,266 --> 02:08:15,096
LAURA: Yeah, so she should do that.

1981
02:08:15,096 --> 02:08:17,954
MARISHA: Am I in there from the gust?

1982
02:08:17,954 --> 02:08:22,434
MATT: No, you guys are still outside of the
chamber. They rushed in after healing each other

1983
02:08:22,434 --> 02:08:26,673
and besides, it's a small room, there's only room
for three people to get in there.

1984
02:08:26,673 --> 02:08:31,707
What are you doing?

1985
02:08:31,707 --> 02:08:39,414
LAURA: Pike's going to rush in as he's doing that
and try to rip the hammer away from the body and

1986
02:08:39,414 --> 02:08:41,269
run out of the room.

1987
02:08:41,269 --> 02:08:45,575
MATT: Interesting. Okay. So first, you do your
attack.

1988
02:08:45,575 --> 02:08:47,076
LIAM: 32, 19, 32.

1989
02:08:47,076 --> 02:08:48,899
MATT: The first and the third hit.

1990
02:08:48,899 --> 02:08:52,532
LIAM: Okay, first and third hit. Sneak attack on
the first because assassin, and I'm going to dump

1991
02:08:52,532 --> 02:09:14,219
Smite into it. Three plus eight. Let me get the
dice first. (counting) 41. And the Smite is 3d8

1992
02:09:14,219 --> 02:09:31,025
because it's undead. I said 41, right? 41, 45, 46,
52, doubled is 104. Plus the psychic damage. 109.

1993
02:09:31,025 --> 02:09:32,382
For the first attack.

1994
02:09:32,382 --> 02:09:40,889
MATT: So. Pike doesn't have much of a fight for
the hammer because you watch as daggers jam into

1995
02:09:40,889 --> 02:09:45,852
the ornamental armor, causing it to bend and twist
inward, ruining the breastplate, and the undead

1996
02:09:45,852 --> 02:09:52,537
king falls apart, and before it can sit up, is now
sitting right back down in the sarcophagus.

1997
02:09:52,537 --> 02:09:54,310
LAURA: She's like, "Well!"

1998
02:09:54,310 --> 02:09:56,289
TALIESIN: Take everything.

1999
02:09:56,289 --> 02:10:01,763
LAURA: Check for traps, because we've been there,
darling. We've been there.

2000
02:10:01,763 --> 02:10:03,236
MARISHA: Take his belt.

2001
02:10:03,236 --> 02:10:07,544
LAURA: Check for fucking traps. How about nobody
dies.

2002
02:10:07,544 --> 02:10:10,576
LIAM: Bad experience with coffins.

2003
02:10:10,576 --> 02:10:13,415
TRAVIS: It really didn't go that poorly last
time.

2004
02:10:13,415 --> 02:10:18,764
SAM: I'm going to check the floor for any pressure
plates or anything. Okay. That's a lot. 30.

2005
02:10:18,764 --> 02:10:20,025
MATT: 30.

2006
02:10:20,025 --> 02:10:22,386
LIAM: 22 for my investigation.

2007
02:10:22,386 --> 02:10:28,586
MATT: Okay. The sarcophagus itself is not trapped.
Nothing of the accoutrements appear to be trapped.

2008
02:10:28,586 --> 02:10:35,082
As you're investigating, the floor plates to the
immediate right and left of the sarcophagus to

2009
02:10:35,082 --> 02:10:40,554
where someone would easily wish to reach in, there
are two plates that are trapped.

2010
02:10:40,554 --> 02:10:43,920
SAM: Just work from the floor or from the--

2011
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:46,945
MATT: From the front, yeah. It's a very small
space, it's meant that if more than one person

2012
02:10:46,945 --> 02:10:51,141
were to-- or if you were to fill the chamber, the
two sides would trigger.

2013
02:10:51,141 --> 02:10:53,393
TALIESIN: Let's get what we need and get out.

2014
02:10:53,393 --> 02:10:55,386
LIAM: Oh no, you can fly over.

2015
02:10:55,386 --> 02:10:58,012
TALIESIN: Before it resets.

2016
02:10:58,012 --> 02:11:06,776
MATT: The bronze plate armor is ruined. It's
decorative, it appears to be more for visual and

2017
02:11:06,776 --> 02:11:15,193
presentation than actual function. So you grab the
dark hammer and the belt. Then you pull out of the

2018
02:11:15,193 --> 02:11:20,243
chamber. The jaw of the open bronze is slowly
(creaking sound).

2019
02:11:20,243 --> 02:11:21,771
LAURA: Get out.

2020
02:11:21,771 --> 02:11:28,590
MATT: You guys exit the chamber, you're now
outside of the cylindrical tomb of the Last King.

2021
02:11:28,590 --> 02:11:31,808
TRAVIS: That was a lot of action. What did you
get?

2022
02:11:31,808 --> 02:11:39,228
LAURA: I found a hammer, Grog. Is it cursed? Can
we tell? If it's cursed? Can we tell if it's bad?

2023
02:11:39,228 --> 02:11:41,422
LIAM: You might be feeling some issues right
now if it were cursed.

2024
02:11:41,422 --> 02:11:43,297
MATT: Anyone have an Identify spell?

2025
02:11:43,297 --> 02:11:47,518
SAM: She might be able to sense good and
evil, no?

2026
02:11:47,518 --> 02:11:49,085
LAURA: I don't know.

2027
02:11:49,085 --> 02:11:51,084
SAM: Or is that for creatures, not for-- That's
for creatures.

2028
02:11:51,084 --> 02:11:53,500
LIAM: I could Detect Good and Evil.

2029
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:54,768
LAURA: Yeah. Here.

2030
02:11:54,768 --> 02:11:56,144
MATT: It's creatures.

2031
02:11:56,144 --> 02:11:57,164
TRAVIS: Gimme.

2032
02:11:57,164 --> 02:12:00,410
SAM: I can look at it and just look at it. I'll
look at it.

2033
02:12:00,410 --> 02:12:01,888
LAURA: Does it feel magic?

2034
02:12:01,888 --> 02:12:04,992
MATT: Make an arcana check, if you're looking at
it. Sorry.

2035
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:07,638
SAM: Just looking. 12.

2036
02:12:07,638 --> 02:12:09,764
LAURA: We suck.

2037
02:12:09,764 --> 02:12:18,628
MATT: It's interesting. It's not so much that you
can see any sort of-- there's no runic

2038
02:12:18,628 --> 02:12:27,907
ornamentation it seems on it, but it's like a deep
jet black metal. Make a history check.

2039
02:12:27,907 --> 02:12:33,374
MARISHA: Does it look like the same black metal as
in the tomb?

2040
02:12:33,374 --> 02:12:34,764
SAM: 22.

2041
02:12:34,764 --> 02:12:40,706
MATT: 22. This is adamantine, which is an
extremely rare and hard metal.

2042
02:12:40,706 --> 02:12:41,859
SAM: Wolverine?

2043
02:12:41,859 --> 02:12:49,500
MATT: It's the fantasy equivalent. It's not
technically magically enchanted, but its nature

2044
02:12:49,500 --> 02:12:52,739
makes it a very powerful weapon by the metal that
it's crafted from.

2045
02:12:52,739 --> 02:12:54,953
MARISHA: The hammer?

2046
02:12:54,953 --> 02:12:56,094
MATT: The hammer.

2047
02:12:56,094 --> 02:12:58,144
TRAVIS: Is it a two-handed weapon? Single-handed?

2048
02:12:58,144 --> 02:13:00,511
MATT: It's a warhammer, so it's one-handed.

2049
02:13:00,511 --> 02:13:03,206
TRAVIS: I'm just saying.

2050
02:13:03,206 --> 02:13:04,967
SAM: What's your hammer like?

2051
02:13:04,967 --> 02:13:12,420
TRAVIS: My Dwarven Thrower? It can be single or
double-handed. It's not a warhammer. It flies back

2052
02:13:12,420 --> 02:13:13,934
to my hand, though.

2053
02:13:13,934 --> 02:13:15,296
SAM: Oh, that's pretty cool.

2054
02:13:15,296 --> 02:13:21,221
TRAVIS: It is. But you can never have enough
hammers. Do you mind if I--?

2055
02:13:21,221 --> 02:13:26,049
SAM: No, but I mean, how are you going to wield
this? You have two other weapons, don't you?

2056
02:13:26,049 --> 02:13:31,524
TRAVIS: Are you kidding me? I'm like a fucking
Home Depot of weapons. I got what you need.

2057
02:13:31,524 --> 02:13:32,856
SAM: Sure, go for it.

2058
02:13:32,856 --> 02:13:34,403
LAURA: What about the belt?

2059
02:13:34,403 --> 02:13:36,009
MATT: The belt? Make an arcana check.

2060
02:13:36,009 --> 02:13:39,386
SAM: Let me look at that. I have no idea what that
is.

2061
02:13:39,386 --> 02:13:44,968
TRAVIS: Just because I want to know, can I go up
to the doorway and hit the side of the doorway

2062
02:13:44,968 --> 02:13:47,665
with the adamantine black hammer?

2063
02:13:47,665 --> 02:13:52,436
MATT: It does require attunement to use its effect
or power.

2064
02:13:52,436 --> 02:13:54,204
LAURA: Oh! It needs attunement.

2065
02:13:54,204 --> 02:13:56,018
TRAVIS: Yeah, without attuning. I just hit the
doorway.

2066
02:13:56,018 --> 02:13:59,875
MATT: Okay. It's solid, it's hefty, it's nice. One
of the better hammers you've ever wielded.

2067
02:13:59,875 --> 02:14:02,617
TRAVIS: It's solid. It's hefty. It's one of the
better hammers I've ever wielded.

2068
02:14:02,617 --> 02:14:05,047
SAM: Are you going to unattune from something to
attune to this?

2069
02:14:05,047 --> 02:14:06,034
TRAVIS: No.

2070
02:14:06,034 --> 02:14:07,207
LAURA: Just to have it.

2071
02:14:07,207 --> 02:14:08,270
SAM: Then what is it?

2072
02:14:08,270 --> 02:14:09,210
TRAVIS: Bag of Holding.

2073
02:14:09,210 --> 02:14:11,518
LAURA: This is totally worth it. We don't know
what any of this shit is.

2074
02:14:11,518 --> 02:14:16,167
TALIESIN: We don't know. Let me take a look at
that belt, maybe. Wait, you have to be trained in

2075
02:14:16,167 --> 02:14:17,685
arcana to identify something, don't you?

2076
02:14:17,685 --> 02:14:19,271
MATT: I would say for the most part, yeah.

2077
02:14:19,271 --> 02:14:21,097
TALIESIN: Is there anybody else trained in
arcana?

2078
02:14:21,097 --> 02:14:23,960
MATT: I mean, you can make a base check to give a
glance, but you're not going to be able to learn

2079
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:26,305
much about the nature of any enchantment if you
find one.

2080
02:14:26,305 --> 02:14:29,439
TALIESIN: Does 23 do anything?

2081
02:14:29,439 --> 02:14:39,219
MATT: I will say looking at it, there does appear to be
runes inscribed very faintly in parts of the

2082
02:14:39,219 --> 02:14:45,159
leather around it and the way the rectangular
opals are set into it, there is a glimmer of some

2083
02:14:45,159 --> 02:14:46,722
sort of enchantment based into it.

2084
02:14:46,722 --> 02:14:48,626
TALIESIN: I want to attune to it and see what
happens.

2085
02:14:48,626 --> 02:14:50,429
MARISHA: We have to take another short rest.

2086
02:14:50,429 --> 02:14:53,081
TALIESIN: Next time, yeah. Let's get a little
further.

2087
02:14:53,081 --> 02:14:55,198
SAM: Next time? We're about to go fight fucking
Vecna.

2088
02:14:55,198 --> 02:15:00,453
TALIESIN: I mean, we're on our way, but we've got
a lot further to go.

2089
02:15:00,453 --> 02:15:04,571
SAM: Well, that was fruitful. Let's keep going.

2090
02:15:04,571 --> 02:15:06,352
TRAVIS: All right. Let's go back to the other
way.

2091
02:15:06,352 --> 02:15:12,810
TALIESIN: I think I'm going to try the belt on and
see what happens.

2092
02:15:12,810 --> 02:15:15,868
TRAVIS: Yeah, do it.

2093
02:15:15,868 --> 02:15:17,101
LIAM: Fred.

2094
02:15:17,101 --> 02:15:18,431
MARISHA: While we're walking?

2095
02:15:18,431 --> 02:15:19,668
LIAM: Freddie.

2096
02:15:19,668 --> 02:15:21,297
TALIESIN: It's obviously enchanted, it doesn't--

2097
02:15:21,297 --> 02:15:24,247
SAM: Who would be buried with a cursed belt?

2098
02:15:24,247 --> 02:15:27,358
TRAVIS: Absolutely you would. Yep. That's exactly
what you would do with it.

2099
02:15:27,358 --> 02:15:32,339
SAM: I think it's a great idea. We're gods now, we
can do anything we want.

2100
02:15:32,339 --> 02:15:36,934
MARISHA: I mean, we have pulled cursed items out
of tombs before.

2101
02:15:36,934 --> 02:15:39,718
SAM: They haven't permanently killed any of us.

2102
02:15:39,718 --> 02:15:40,821
MARISHA: Sure.

2103
02:15:40,821 --> 02:15:42,297
LAURA: You can do what?

2104
02:15:42,297 --> 02:15:47,204
LIAM: I wasn't going to say I could do anything. I
think that's a shitty idea right now.

2105
02:15:47,204 --> 02:15:48,521
MARISHA: We really need to keep moving.

2106
02:15:48,521 --> 02:15:50,667
TRAVIS: We travel back down the---

2107
02:15:50,667 --> 02:15:52,476
LAURA: Yeah, the other fucking direction.

2108
02:15:52,476 --> 02:15:56,881
MATT: All right. So, you head the other way. So,
you're holding off?

2109
02:15:56,881 --> 02:16:01,292
TALIESIN: No, I want to find out, so I'm going to
pull the gloves off and I'm going to put the belt on.

2110
02:16:01,292 --> 02:16:05,521
MATT: Okay, so you begin to attune to it as you
guys are walking, take some time with it.

2111
02:16:05,521 --> 02:16:08,931
TALIESIN and MARISHA: I hope it's great.

2112
02:16:08,931 --> 02:16:14,640
MATT: Following the right path, you continue for
roughly 100 or so feet in a switchback motion.

2113
02:16:14,640 --> 02:16:19,537
Once you're past that portion of the tunnel, it
seems to curve back and it ascends in like a

2114
02:16:19,537 --> 02:16:26,632
switchback path a bit. You can see at this point
more stairs, more carved stone steps are beginning

2115
02:16:26,632 --> 02:16:31,684
to emerge; some of the rough earth that you had
encountered in previous T-intersections seems to

2116
02:16:31,684 --> 02:16:39,030
be falling away to some semblance of actual
holding architecture. And eventually it reveals a

2117
02:16:39,030 --> 02:16:44,331
much larger hall of very apparent dwarven
architecture. The ceiling now pulls up to about 60

2118
02:16:44,331 --> 02:16:49,328
feet above you, stalagmites dripping condensation
from the shadow above, you can hear the distant

2119
02:16:49,328 --> 02:16:56,639
drops in the distance of the cavern before you.
You can make out broken ruins built into the walls

2120
02:16:56,639 --> 02:17:02,499
of each side. Ancient stone homes and structures
that now crack and crumble with each footfall of

2121
02:17:02,499 --> 02:17:08,698
the titan. As you hear the (impact) of the next
heavy footfall, you see as a couple of stones

2122
02:17:08,698 --> 02:17:13,642
tumble from some of these structures, clattering
across the cavern floor.

2123
02:17:13,642 --> 02:17:16,310
LIAM and MATT: Perception check.

2124
02:17:16,310 --> 02:17:18,684
LIAM: Natural 20.

2125
02:17:18,684 --> 02:17:29,551
MATT: Vax. You hear a faint, distant, echoing,
alien sound in the darkness ahead of you.

2126
02:17:29,551 --> 02:17:31,052
LIAM: Far-ish?

2127
02:17:31,052 --> 02:17:33,573
MATT: Further than your visual range.

2128
02:17:33,573 --> 02:17:40,389
LIAM: Further than my visual range. Okay, we've
got company up ahead. So, yeah.

2129
02:17:40,389 --> 02:17:43,759
MARISHA: What kind of an alien language? Any that
we recognize?

2130
02:17:43,759 --> 02:17:51,441
MATT: You hear this faint-- sounds like a voice,
droning, slightly changing pitch, but it's so

2131
02:17:51,441 --> 02:17:56,779
disparate and so distant that you can't make up
anything other than noticing that it exists

2132
02:17:56,779 --> 02:18:03,970
amongst the steady, low, rhythmic rumbles of each
separate footfall of the beast you now currently

2133
02:18:03,970 --> 02:18:05,797
are within.

2134
02:18:05,797 --> 02:18:08,243
TRAVIS: Vax. Go fetch.

2135
02:18:08,243 --> 02:18:10,408
LIAM: Stealth.

2136
02:18:10,408 --> 02:18:13,737
MATT: All right. Make a stealth check.

2137
02:18:13,737 --> 02:18:18,638
LIAM: 30.

2138
02:18:18,638 --> 02:18:26,375
MATT: Okay. As you dart ahead, you come up a few
steps onto a raised thoroughfare amongst the

2139
02:18:26,375 --> 02:18:32,204
various dwarven buildings here. It looks like
there is a crevasse or chasm that this portion of

2140
02:18:32,204 --> 02:18:38,060
the city was built along, and you can see up above
there were platforms where staircases would rise up and there

2141
02:18:38,060 --> 02:18:43,803
were raised buildings built into these chambers
that have since fallen and crumbled down with the

2142
02:18:43,803 --> 02:18:51,761
movement of the titan, leaving these ruined piles of
broken walls, floors, and decorative materials.

2143
02:18:51,761 --> 02:19:03,341
You can see broken and bent dinnerware and
metallic decorative plates or vases that have

2144
02:19:03,341 --> 02:19:10,244
since fallen and crumbled beneath the collapsing
structures. There was once a thriving city that

2145
02:19:10,244 --> 02:19:14,836
you're now getting more glimpses of the further
into this beast you go that has been long deserted

2146
02:19:14,836 --> 02:19:20,661
and now, the longer it travels, it begins to be
erased by the vibrations of the creature's

2147
02:19:20,661 --> 02:19:30,663
movement. As you continue forward, you can see
there's a portion where the-- Couldn't wait, could you?

2148
02:19:30,663 --> 02:19:32,857
TRAVIS: The damn growl. I thought it was a growl.

2149
02:19:32,857 --> 02:19:34,728
LAURA and MATT: It sounded like a growl.

2150
02:19:34,728 --> 02:19:36,907
LIAM: Man, I had to pee so bad, I ran out of the
room.

2151
02:19:36,907 --> 02:19:42,599
MATT: I know. As you crest the top of this upper
area of the road, you glance down and can see a

2152
02:19:42,599 --> 02:19:49,675
portion of it is underwater, there's a small pool
where droplets drop and at the edge of it you can

2153
02:19:49,675 --> 02:19:56,209
barely see the shape of a creature, hunched at the
edge of the waterside.

2154
02:19:56,209 --> 02:19:58,557
LIAM: How close am I to that?

2155
02:19:58,557 --> 02:20:02,197
MATT: It's about 50 to 55 feet from you.

2156
02:20:02,197 --> 02:20:04,889
LIAM: Divine Sense.

2157
02:20:04,889 --> 02:20:08,048
MATT: Okay. Divine Sense to see if--

2158
02:20:08,048 --> 02:20:09,613
LIAM: It's undead.

2159
02:20:09,613 --> 02:20:12,673
MATT: It is not undead; you do not get an undead
sense.

2160
02:20:12,673 --> 02:20:16,269
LIAM: Okay. Or a fiend or a celestial?

2161
02:20:16,269 --> 02:20:21,986
MATT: It's too far away to get a close view at
this point because it's at the edge of your

2162
02:20:21,986 --> 02:20:26,989
darkvision. You can just make out its shape; it's
humanoid, it has two arms, two legs, and it looks

2163
02:20:26,989 --> 02:20:35,271
roughly the size of you or Vex. But you now see
it's sitting at a fallen and partially ruined

2164
02:20:35,271 --> 02:20:40,094
dwarven statue, some sort of structure that was on
a pedestal that had fallen at the edge-- and it's

2165
02:20:40,094 --> 02:20:47,889
sitting over top of it. It's got gray, splotchy
skin, tough exterior, armored spines or plates

2166
02:20:47,889 --> 02:20:52,533
along its back that stick up as it hunches forward
like some sort of porcupine.

2167
02:20:52,533 --> 02:20:56,980
LAURA: Does it look like that thing in the Nine Hells
that we saw? Or in the City of Brass?

2168
02:20:56,980 --> 02:21:05,386
MATT: Not quite, it's smaller than that. You see a
collection of odd trinkets and objects that dangle

2169
02:21:05,386 --> 02:21:13,117
around its waist that clink as it shifts and moves, like a
belt of scavenged trophies. Its claws currently

2170
02:21:13,117 --> 02:21:20,652
tear into some sort of unidentified fleshy limb;
it has clawed fingers. It's digging into it, tears

2171
02:21:20,652 --> 02:21:26,920
a piece of flesh off of it and chews and slurps it
back. It suddenly freezes up--

2172
02:21:26,920 --> 02:21:28,781
LIAM: (daggers whooshing) One two three.

2173
02:21:28,781 --> 02:21:30,750
ALL: Oh.

2174
02:21:30,750 --> 02:21:32,674
MATT: Roll for an attack.

2175
02:21:32,674 --> 02:21:36,401
MARISHA: What if he's nice? What if he's that
random creepy merchant you find in the

2176
02:21:36,401 --> 02:21:37,620
middle of nowhere?

2177
02:21:37,620 --> 02:21:40,678
TRAVIS: Nobody that eats with their hands in the
inside of a titan is nice.

2178
02:21:40,678 --> 02:21:47,987
LIAM: Advantage on all three attacks. First attack
is 29.

2179
02:21:47,987 --> 02:21:49,446
MATT: Okay, that hits.

2180
02:21:49,446 --> 02:21:51,084
LIAM: Second attack.

2181
02:21:51,084 --> 02:21:53,513
SAM: He's just a nice old man.

2182
02:21:53,513 --> 02:22:02,861
LIAM: Second attack is 32. Third attack is 27.

2183
02:22:02,861 --> 02:22:04,964
MATT: That hits.

2184
02:22:04,964 --> 02:22:07,982
LAURA: (gentle old man impression) Thank god
you're here! I've been--

2185
02:22:07,982 --> 02:22:10,195
TALIESIN: There's no throat left.

2186
02:22:10,195 --> 02:22:12,592
MARISHA: (rugged voice) Would you like to see my
wares--

2187
02:22:12,592 --> 02:22:15,559
TRAVIS: I've been freed from my--

2188
02:22:15,559 --> 02:22:20,385
SAM: (gravelly voice) Don't go in the crypt of--

2189
02:22:20,385 --> 02:22:24,075
(laughter)

2190
02:22:24,075 --> 02:22:28,492
MATT: So the first dagger does--

2191
02:22:28,492 --> 02:22:41,892
LIAM: Ten, 14, 17, 23, 24, 48 plus psychic damage.
54 for the first attack.

2192
02:22:41,892 --> 02:22:47,454
MATT: The two daggers hit nothing as the first
dagger strikes and slaughters the creature. And

2193
02:22:47,454 --> 02:22:55,891
hits the water and now floats up, unmoving in the
pond there. You can see the liquid around it

2194
02:22:55,891 --> 02:22:57,366
darkening.

2195
02:22:57,366 --> 02:23:00,134
TALIESIN: You just killed an NPC!

2196
02:23:00,134 --> 02:23:06,130
LIAM: We're not in Emon in the market square!

2197
02:23:06,130 --> 02:23:14,244
MATT: No one knows about this. The sheer force of
the first dagger sends it off the broken statue

2198
02:23:14,244 --> 02:23:16,415
and it falls into the water and it is now
unmoving.

2199
02:23:16,415 --> 02:23:18,574
LIAM: We are in <i>hell</i>. Perception check.

2200
02:23:18,574 --> 02:23:21,722
TRAVIS: All we know is you're just out there.

2201
02:23:21,722 --> 02:23:27,786
MATT: You guys do hear this distant echoing
(creature dying) that echoes throughout the

2202
02:23:27,786 --> 02:23:28,760
chamber.

2203
02:23:28,760 --> 02:23:29,970
LIAM: 31.

2204
02:23:29,970 --> 02:23:32,789
MATT: Okay, you glance around. Nothing else seems
to be moving in the chamber.

2205
02:23:32,789 --> 02:23:34,491
LIAM: All right, I'm going to sneak up to it.

2206
02:23:34,491 --> 02:23:40,621
MATT: Okay. You move up to it, you can see now
it's hunched in the water, its face is under the

2207
02:23:40,621 --> 02:23:50,387
ground. The water itself is maybe waist deep at
most, and it's there floating in the liquid.

2208
02:23:50,387 --> 02:23:52,798
SAM: It was holding a baby.

2209
02:23:52,798 --> 02:23:57,088
LIAM: Flame Tongue is out, what am I looking at?

2210
02:23:57,088 --> 02:24:03,358
MATT: Do you want to look at its face?

2211
02:24:03,358 --> 02:24:04,497
LIAM: Yeah.

2212
02:24:04,497 --> 02:24:11,772
MATT: Okay, as you pull one of the spines and pull
it back, you can see toothy jaws, humanoid-like,

2213
02:24:11,772 --> 02:24:16,901
but grey and coming to a point where you can see
jagged teeth in the top and bottom row, and one

2214
02:24:16,901 --> 02:24:21,696
singular large yellowish eye in the center of its
face, no nose, and the eye is

2215
02:24:21,696 --> 02:24:23,511
slightly rolled back.

2216
02:24:23,511 --> 02:24:30,785
LIAM: Liam knows what this thing is, but Vax does
not. Fuck this thing! I'm going to start looking--

2217
02:24:30,785 --> 02:24:33,284
what are the trinkets on it?

2218
02:24:33,284 --> 02:24:35,161
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2219
02:24:35,161 --> 02:24:38,272
LAURA: You don't know what Matt would've done with
whatever you think!

2220
02:24:38,272 --> 02:24:39,759
LIAM: Oh, he could do anything!

2221
02:24:39,759 --> 02:24:41,621
MARISHA: Yeah, Clarota was nice!

2222
02:24:41,621 --> 02:24:46,980
LIAM: Was he? Did you say investigation or
perception?

2223
02:24:46,980 --> 02:24:48,257
MATT: Investigation.

2224
02:24:48,257 --> 02:24:54,382
LIAM: Investigation, all right, thank you. Some
weird energy tonight, guys. 19.

2225
02:24:54,382 --> 02:25:00,395
MATT: 19. Okay. A lot of them appear to be bones,
many of them ancient, and a couple of them look to

2226
02:25:00,395 --> 02:25:05,647
be more fresh. There's a filth-encrusted dagger
that's hanging from the side, an empty scroll

2227
02:25:05,647 --> 02:25:15,273
case, a spyglass, half of a book that looks like
it's old and rotten and falling apart, and a

2228
02:25:15,273 --> 02:25:17,103
singular bronze key.

2229
02:25:17,103 --> 02:25:25,345
LIAM: I rip off the spyglass and go, oh, that looks
nerdy, Percy will like that, and then I yank off

2230
02:25:25,345 --> 02:25:31,232
the dagger and go, that looks all right, and I
stick it in the Blinkback Belt and then-- what was

2231
02:25:31,232 --> 02:25:36,543
the last thing? It was a key. To the bronze door
right, yeah.

2232
02:25:36,543 --> 02:25:39,952
MATT: Looking at the shape and size of it, it
probably would have fit pretty

2233
02:25:39,952 --> 02:25:41,754
snugly into that door.

2234
02:25:41,754 --> 02:25:44,892
LIAM: In the dark by myself. Oh, that is fucking
hilarious.

2235
02:25:44,892 --> 02:25:48,611
TRAVIS: No book?

2236
02:25:48,611 --> 02:25:51,891
LIAM: The tattered remains of the book? Eh.

2237
02:25:51,891 --> 02:25:53,460
MATT: You don't recognize the language.

2238
02:25:53,460 --> 02:25:58,574
LIAM: Eh. I don't. I let it sink back into the
water.

2239
02:25:58,574 --> 02:26:00,537
MATT: Okay. Well, it's still floating.

2240
02:26:00,537 --> 02:26:05,948
TRAVIS: Vax. What did you find up ahead?

2241
02:26:05,948 --> 02:26:11,944
LIAM: A one eyed, one horned, swimming, purple,
people-- Come on up, please,

2242
02:26:11,944 --> 02:26:13,429
we should keep moving.

2243
02:26:13,429 --> 02:26:15,042
TRAVIS: All right. We join him.

2244
02:26:15,042 --> 02:26:19,342
MATT: All right. You guys approach carefully,
walking through the center of this twisting chasm.

2245
02:26:19,342 --> 02:26:26,794
You come over the rise of the central road and
descend to meet up with Vax where you see there

2246
02:26:26,794 --> 02:26:28,627
was the pool and the floating creature.

2247
02:26:28,627 --> 02:26:30,802
LAURA: Eww. What is that? Do any of us know what
it was?

2248
02:26:30,802 --> 02:26:33,224
TALIESIN: Am I starting to get a vibe or am I not
starting to get a vibe?

2249
02:26:33,224 --> 02:26:34,062
MATT: Of?

2250
02:26:34,062 --> 02:26:34,967
TALIESIN: The belt.

2251
02:26:34,967 --> 02:26:37,418
MATT: Oh, the belt? Okay, I'd say at this point.
Sure.

2252
02:26:37,418 --> 02:26:38,795
TALIESIN: Starting to get a vibe?

2253
02:26:38,795 --> 02:26:39,686
MATT: Sure.

2254
02:26:39,686 --> 02:26:40,681
SAM: Ooh.

2255
02:26:40,681 --> 02:26:41,825
MARISHA: Is it vibey?

2256
02:26:41,825 --> 02:26:43,332
TALIESIN: It says. Okay.

2257
02:26:43,332 --> 02:26:47,319
LAURA: Read it out loud.

2258
02:26:47,319 --> 02:26:50,247
SAM: I don't even know how to pronounce that first
word.

2259
02:26:50,247 --> 02:26:53,678
TALIESIN: The attuned gains resistance to psychic
damage, in addition they are immune to being

2260
02:26:53,678 --> 02:26:56,066
paralyzed or petrified and cannot be knocked
prone.

2261
02:26:56,066 --> 02:26:57,965
TRAVIS: Okay, that's fucking clutch.

2262
02:26:57,965 --> 02:26:59,786
LAURA: Okay, that's really big.

2263
02:26:59,786 --> 02:27:02,878
TALIESIN: As an action you can channel your anger
to produce a shockwave of thunderous energy, as

2264
02:27:02,878 --> 02:27:09,022
with the Thunderwave spell. DC 16, cast at fifth
level. You cannot use this feature until you

2265
02:27:09,022 --> 02:27:10,391
finish a short rest.

2266
02:27:10,391 --> 02:27:11,521
SAM: How do you pronounce that first name?

2267
02:27:11,521 --> 02:27:13,425
MARISHA: Cincture. Cincture of the Stone King.

2268
02:27:13,425 --> 02:27:14,881
SAM: Cinc-ture?

2269
02:27:14,881 --> 02:27:18,509
MARISHA: Cincture. It's like Spanx. We should call
it Spanx of the Stone King.

2270
02:27:18,509 --> 02:27:20,434
SAM: How do you know that?

2271
02:27:20,434 --> 02:27:21,796
TALIESIN: How do you not?

2272
02:27:21,796 --> 02:27:24,565
SAM: Oh, it's like, people still make these
things?

2273
02:27:24,565 --> 02:27:27,419
MARISHA: It's like a cincture. Like Spanx.

2274
02:27:27,419 --> 02:27:30,922
SAM: Oh, I've never seen that word before.

2275
02:27:30,922 --> 02:27:35,956
LIAM: Oh, Freddie. Get excited. I found a spyglass
covered in diarrhea. Would you like it?

2276
02:27:35,956 --> 02:27:40,436
TALIESIN: Yes. Clean it, please.

2277
02:27:40,436 --> 02:27:43,745
LAURA: What is this creature? Do we know what
this creature is?

2278
02:27:43,745 --> 02:27:47,725
MATT: This would be an arcana check on this one,
actually.

2279
02:27:47,725 --> 02:27:50,664
TRAVIS: Because he's enjoying his belt, can I take
out--

2280
02:27:50,664 --> 02:27:52,634
MATT: Is anyone here trained in arcana?

2281
02:27:52,634 --> 02:27:53,688
LAURA: Scanlan.

2282
02:27:53,688 --> 02:27:56,971
SAM: Well, I'm not proficient in it, weirdly, but
I am an arcanist.

2283
02:27:56,971 --> 02:28:00,104
MATT: Yeah, make a check with disadvantage.

2284
02:28:00,104 --> 02:28:01,921
SAM: Seven.

2285
02:28:01,921 --> 02:28:03,287
LAURA: With disadvantage.

2286
02:28:03,287 --> 02:28:04,389
SAM: Four.

2287
02:28:04,389 --> 02:28:06,688
MATT: You're not entirely certain what this is.

2288
02:28:06,688 --> 02:28:09,726
TALIESIN: Is that with your arcana?

2289
02:28:09,726 --> 02:28:11,426
SAM: I mean, it's ten.

2290
02:28:11,426 --> 02:28:14,004
LAURA: Oh, well that's better than four.

2291
02:28:14,004 --> 02:28:15,972
SAM: Yeah, but it's still sucky.

2292
02:28:15,972 --> 02:28:21,673
TRAVIS: Could I take out the black metallic hammer
now that he's all excited about his belt and begin

2293
02:28:21,673 --> 02:28:23,422
my attuning period?

2294
02:28:23,422 --> 02:28:27,015
MATT: Okay. So you're going to attune. Are you
guys going to wait for him or are you going to

2295
02:28:27,015 --> 02:28:28,335
walk with him as--

2296
02:28:28,335 --> 02:28:30,054
SAM: No we're not fucking waiting for--

2297
02:28:30,054 --> 02:28:34,085
MATT: Okay, you look at the creature and leave it
there in the water. You begin concentrating on the

2298
02:28:34,085 --> 02:28:36,599
hammer. What are you unattuning from to take its
place?

2299
02:28:36,599 --> 02:28:37,948
TRAVIS: Instead of the Bloodaxe.

2300
02:28:37,948 --> 02:28:42,996
MATT: Okay. So you set the Bloodaxe away and
attune to the adamantine hammer as you begin to trek

2301
02:28:42,996 --> 02:28:44,250
further into--

2302
02:28:44,250 --> 02:28:48,451
LAURA: Is there anything else interesting in this
cavern? That we can see?

2303
02:28:48,451 --> 02:28:52,793
MATT: We'll get to that in a minute. As you begin
to leave the watered pool to head further into

2304
02:28:52,793 --> 02:28:59,090
this chasm, we're going to take a break. Because
it's been a while. We'll be back here in a little

2305
02:28:59,164 --> 02:29:05,798
bit, guys. We do have this Wenge Dice Vault for
one of you guys to win from our friends over at

2306
02:29:05,798 --> 02:29:10,800
Wyrmwood. This is the same wood that I use for my
dice box over here.

2307
02:29:10,800 --> 02:29:17,650
SAM: You will win Matthew Mercer's wood tonight.
No?

2308
02:29:17,650 --> 02:29:22,055
MATT: That works. So yeah. Head over to the twitch
chat if you want to be entered in this when called

2309
02:29:22,055 --> 02:29:27,941
for in the the twitch chat. Tonight's code word is
titan. T-I-T-A-N. Enter that to be put into the

2310
02:29:27,941 --> 02:29:30,495
drawing and one of you lucky winners will have
this. We'll announce you when we come back from

2311
02:29:30,495 --> 02:29:34,101
the break. See you guys here in a few.

2312
02:29:34,467 --> 02:29:36,810
MATT: And welcome back to Critical Role.

2313
02:29:36,810 --> 02:29:39,484
(laughter)

2314
02:29:39,484 --> 02:29:47,155
MATT: First off, we have a winner. The winner of
the (laughs) of the giveaway tonight is

2315
02:29:47,155 --> 02:29:53,730
Dalen365. D-A-L-E-N. Dalen365, congratulations.
Danoba will contact you for your information and

2316
02:29:53,730 --> 02:29:55,793
we'll get that sent out to you, so well done.

2317
02:29:55,793 --> 02:30:00,513
LIAM: You know what? 82 people tweeted me that
Pike speaks Dwarvish. So thanks guys, thanks.

2318
02:30:00,513 --> 02:30:02,118
LAURA: Yes, thank you for informing us.

2319
02:30:02,118 --> 02:30:03,715
TRAVIS: (garbled) Who cares? I speak Dwarvish.

2320
02:30:03,715 --> 02:30:08,201
MATT: I like to think that Pike could, but wanted
to let him do it. "You can do it." She taught him

2321
02:30:08,268 --> 02:30:13,918
to write, taught him to read. She's like, "Good
job."

2322
02:30:13,918 --> 02:30:16,559
TRAVIS: Thank you. I'm a scholar.

2323
02:30:16,559 --> 02:30:19,248
MATT: Also, before we get started, Laura,
something you wanted to mention at the beginning,

2324
02:30:19,248 --> 02:30:20,575
but you weren't here for the announcements.

2325
02:30:20,575 --> 02:30:24,036
LAURA: Oh man, yeah. Uncharted: The Lost Legacy
came out this week.

2326
02:30:24,036 --> 02:30:26,330
TRAVIS: It's so good!

2327
02:30:26,330 --> 02:30:27,850
LAURA: You should check it out!

2328
02:30:27,850 --> 02:30:29,558
TRAVIS: You play Nadine.

2329
02:30:29,558 --> 02:30:31,665
LAURA: I play Nadine. You should go see it.

2330
02:30:31,665 --> 02:30:33,393
SAM: You should go see it?

2331
02:30:33,393 --> 02:30:35,553
MATT: At a theater near you.

2332
02:30:35,553 --> 02:30:37,265
TALIESIN: At a drive-in near you.

2333
02:30:37,265 --> 02:30:39,006
LAURA: Go see it, and then play it.

2334
02:30:39,006 --> 02:30:40,443
LIAM: It's a match-three game, right?

2335
02:30:40,443 --> 02:30:48,465
LAURA: Yeah, and also Marvel's Spider-Man show
premiered on the 19th. I'm Gwen Stacy on that.

2336
02:30:48,465 --> 02:30:50,875
MATT: I'm the Rhino on that.

2337
02:30:50,875 --> 02:30:54,656
MARISHA: Your shirt's so dope, too.

2338
02:30:54,656 --> 02:30:58,175
LAURA: I saw the episode, too, and it was really
good.

2339
02:30:58,175 --> 02:31:04,392
MATT: He's coming up throughout the series, and
he's a ridiculous character. He's fun. Fantastic.

2340
02:31:04,392 --> 02:31:13,363
I forgot about that; thank you for the reminder.
All right, so bringing it back in. As you've left

2341
02:31:13,363 --> 02:31:17,725
the pool and the body behind, you continue further
into this chasm.

2342
02:31:17,725 --> 02:31:23,199
TRAVIS: Oh man, that's going to be a good Talks
later.

2343
02:31:23,199 --> 02:31:25,724
(laughter)

2344
02:31:25,724 --> 02:31:29,540
TRAVIS: Not that we heard anything about what you
just did.

2345
02:31:29,540 --> 02:31:32,741
LIAM: You might have seen a corpse in the water,
floating.

2346
02:31:32,741 --> 02:31:34,444
TRAVIS: I don't pay attention to that shit.

2347
02:31:34,444 --> 02:31:37,131
MATT: All right.

2348
02:31:37,131 --> 02:31:43,807
LAURA: I wanted to look in the chamber and see if
there was anything else interesting before we

2349
02:31:43,807 --> 02:31:45,140
walked out.

2350
02:31:45,140 --> 02:31:49,122
MATT: There are a number of dwarven buildings in
the vicinity. Some are partially or completely

2351
02:31:49,122 --> 02:31:55,227
collapsed. Some had fallen from outcroppings and
platforms that have since fallen into the center

2352
02:31:55,227 --> 02:31:56,556
of the chamber.

2353
02:31:56,556 --> 02:31:59,520
TRAVIS: It's almost as if this room is meant to
introduce something.

2354
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:02,994
TALIESIN: Stop it!

2355
02:32:02,994 --> 02:32:05,942
MATT: You rolled a perception. It was?

2356
02:32:05,942 --> 02:32:07,479
LAURA: I didn't roll it.

2357
02:32:07,479 --> 02:32:09,495
MATT: You didn't roll yet? That's right; you did.

2358
02:32:09,495 --> 02:32:11,249
LIAM: To perceive a dead body in the water.

2359
02:32:11,249 --> 02:32:12,925
LAURA: 29.

2360
02:32:12,925 --> 02:32:22,865
MATT: 29. Glancing about, there's the continuation
of the path. The chasm seems to be pinching a bit

2361
02:32:22,865 --> 02:32:29,781
the further forward you go; it's closing in. You
see six dwarven households or structures that

2362
02:32:29,781 --> 02:32:34,597
could be entered, that look structurally enough
sound that they're standing.

2363
02:32:34,597 --> 02:32:37,619
LAURA: Do they look rich?

2364
02:32:37,619 --> 02:32:41,552
MATT: From this perspective? Everything looks
pretty wrecked.

2365
02:32:41,552 --> 02:32:50,035
LAURA: Okay. We're in a hurry, right? I'm not
going to go search for stuff.

2366
02:32:50,035 --> 02:32:57,503
MATT: All right. Continuing forward, the floor
continues to ascend upward as you reach the edge

2367
02:32:57,503 --> 02:33:02,959
of where the earth begins to meet to that pinch at
the edge of the chasm, and there, the tunnel

2368
02:33:02,959 --> 02:33:08,962
continues anew. There are stairs that continue for
about 25 or 30 feet beyond, as you ascend to those

2369
02:33:08,962 --> 02:33:14,422
steps. They begin to vanish beneath more loose
earth and stone for another 20 or so feet before

2370
02:33:14,422 --> 02:33:25,145
reemerging again in places. About 40 feet past
that, the tunnel ends at a set of heavy stone

2371
02:33:25,145 --> 02:33:31,216
eight-foot doors. The surrounding cavern has slid
in places, but it doesn't appear to be burying the

2372
02:33:31,216 --> 02:33:35,578
door, to a certain extent. They're just closed.
You don't see any handles; you don't see any

2373
02:33:35,578 --> 02:33:40,945
keyhole entry point. They're just two stone slabs.
They're simple. They're smooth. There's no

2374
02:33:40,945 --> 02:33:44,616
intricate scrolling. There's no Dwarven text.
They're just impeding your progress.

2375
02:33:44,616 --> 02:33:46,005
LIAM: Let's have a look.

2376
02:33:46,005 --> 02:33:47,631
LAURA: Yeah, I'll look around.

2377
02:33:47,631 --> 02:33:48,997
MATT: Investigation check.

2378
02:33:48,997 --> 02:33:55,706
LIAM: Oh, terrible.

2379
02:33:55,706 --> 02:33:57,457
LAURA: 21.

2380
02:33:57,457 --> 02:33:58,863
LIAM: 18.

2381
02:33:58,863 --> 02:34:03,711
MATT: Okay. There does not appear to be any
locking mechanism. There doesn't appear to be any

2382
02:34:03,711 --> 02:34:09,058
traps around it. They're just two stone slabs that
are jammed together.

2383
02:34:09,058 --> 02:34:10,701
LAURA: No hinges, no nothing.

2384
02:34:10,701 --> 02:34:11,730
MATT: No.

2385
02:34:11,730 --> 02:34:13,142
TRAVIS: (clears throat)

2386
02:34:13,142 --> 02:34:15,428
LIAM: Yes, Greg?

2387
02:34:15,428 --> 02:34:18,886
TRAVIS: No, I just had a tickle in my throat.

2388
02:34:18,886 --> 02:34:21,652
LAURA: Did you want to smash your way through this
very loudly?

2389
02:34:21,652 --> 02:34:23,897
TRAVIS: Oh, did you want me to smash through this
very loudly?

2390
02:34:23,897 --> 02:34:24,881
LAURA: No.

2391
02:34:24,881 --> 02:34:26,849
TRAVIS: Gently, with a push, maybe?

2392
02:34:26,849 --> 02:34:28,773
LAURA: Yeah, maybe try to push it first.

2393
02:34:28,773 --> 02:34:38,535
TRAVIS: Fine. Can I push? Wait. Can I try pushing
on one of the slabs? The right slab.

2394
02:34:38,535 --> 02:34:40,194
MATT: Sure. Make a strength check.

2395
02:34:40,194 --> 02:34:41,519
LIAM: Vax is backing the fuck up.

2396
02:34:41,519 --> 02:34:43,494
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm backing up.

2397
02:34:43,494 --> 02:34:46,239
TRAVIS: 24.

2398
02:34:46,239 --> 02:34:54,314
MATT: 24. You put both hands and push and push.
Your fingers (cracking) dig into the stone, and it

2399
02:34:54,314 --> 02:34:59,373
cracks around the exterior where you push about an
inch into the stonework with your Gauntlets. As

2400
02:34:59,373 --> 02:35:05,001
you push, you watch as the surrounding edges of
the stone door-- this is the right or the left one?

2401
02:35:05,001 --> 02:35:06,087
TRAVIS: The right one.

2402
02:35:06,087 --> 02:35:11,201
MATT: The right one, right. You watch as where it
meets the stone, cracks begin to form at the edge

2403
02:35:11,201 --> 02:35:20,292
and with one shift (shifting), it seems to push
forward and (falling and impacting). You actually

2404
02:35:20,292 --> 02:35:25,151
broke whatever mechanism was holding it in place
and caused that side of the door to fall inward

2405
02:35:25,151 --> 02:35:29,797
(booming). As it hits the ground, you hear the
echo (echoing boom).

2406
02:35:29,797 --> 02:35:33,581
TRAVIS: Wait, I know a saying for this: They make
them like they used to!

2407
02:35:33,581 --> 02:35:39,655
MARISHA: That's relevant. Accurate.

2408
02:35:39,655 --> 02:35:43,224
TRAVIS: Can I see anything immediately in the--

2409
02:35:43,224 --> 02:35:44,698
MATT: Make a perception check.

2410
02:35:44,698 --> 02:35:46,094
LIAM: We're all going to die.

2411
02:35:46,094 --> 02:35:48,027
MATT: It is pitch black inside. There is no light
or light source.

2412
02:35:48,027 --> 02:35:53,216
TRAVIS: Look at that! A modifier of zero. 18. I
have darkvision because of the belt.

2413
02:35:53,216 --> 02:35:57,183
MATT: Yep, not bad. All right. So you glance
inside the lightless chamber. First off, the smell

2414
02:35:57,183 --> 02:36:05,780
of rot and time, I guess you could say; that
dusty, old, ancient, untouched scent wafts from

2415
02:36:05,780 --> 02:36:06,963
the chamber.

2416
02:36:06,963 --> 02:36:08,728
LAURA: A really old fart.

2417
02:36:08,728 --> 02:36:18,778
MATT: Yeah. As you glance inside, you find a
single chamber before you that splits off into two

2418
02:36:18,778 --> 02:36:27,285
other chambers, all rectangular, and there are two
other subchambers that are beyond you. These stand

2419
02:36:27,285 --> 02:36:31,950
about 20 feet tall at the height and about 40
feet wide on the one that's on the farthest side,

2420
02:36:31,950 --> 02:36:36,965
and you can't make it far past to the secondary
chamber to the right. And it's asymmetrical; one

2421
02:36:36,965 --> 02:36:40,494
seems closer than the other. There's essentially
three chambers that are all attached together,

2422
02:36:40,494 --> 02:36:47,232
with small entryways that lead to each. The floor
is covered in flaked shale, dirt, the occasional

2423
02:36:47,232 --> 02:36:55,341
glitter of some sort of errant coin or gold piece
or copper piece. At this point, again you hear the

2424
02:36:55,341 --> 02:37:03,608
distant (booming) of a titan footfall. The chamber
shakes, and a fresh layer of dust falls, clouds a

2425
02:37:03,608 --> 02:37:10,716
bit, before resting to the floor. That's the most
you can make out at first glance inside this chamber.

2426
02:37:10,716 --> 02:37:12,392
TRAVIS: There's more tunnels.

2427
02:37:12,392 --> 02:37:15,702
LIAM: Looking for traps, dead guys, from the
door.

2428
02:37:15,702 --> 02:37:21,216
MARISHA: Can I do a peek and check to see if
there's signs of any cave-in potentials?

2429
02:37:21,216 --> 02:37:26,554
Potential cave-ins?

2430
02:37:26,554 --> 02:37:30,307
MATT: Make a perception check.

2431
02:37:30,307 --> 02:37:34,647
LAURA: Can I feel if there's any wind coming from
one of the tunnels, like there's an opening

2432
02:37:34,647 --> 02:37:37,084
somewhere that leads out?

2433
02:37:37,084 --> 02:37:38,839
TRAVIS: With your face?

2434
02:37:38,839 --> 02:37:43,842
LAURA: Yeah, I want to feel the wind on my face.
Thanks.

2435
02:37:43,842 --> 02:37:45,047
MARISHA: 28.

2436
02:37:45,047 --> 02:37:51,512
MATT: Glancing about this chamber, it's very well
made. In fact, based on the smatterings of gold on

2437
02:37:51,512 --> 02:37:59,441
the ground and glancing about the way it's built,
this looks to be specifically a vault. This once

2438
02:37:59,441 --> 02:38:06,183
contained probably a portion of the wealth of the
people of this town.

2439
02:38:06,183 --> 02:38:08,199
LIAM: Oh, somebody rolled this place.

2440
02:38:08,199 --> 02:38:10,422
MARISHA: We don't hear anybody or anything?

2441
02:38:10,422 --> 02:38:11,881
MATT: Not at the moment, no.

2442
02:38:11,881 --> 02:38:14,535
LIAM: 18 investigation check for traps and dead
guys.

2443
02:38:14,535 --> 02:38:16,276
LAURA: 25 for wind!

2444
02:38:16,276 --> 02:38:18,232
(laughter)

2445
02:38:18,232 --> 02:38:23,409
MATT: There is a faint bit of airflow through the
chamber now that this door is open.

2446
02:38:23,409 --> 02:38:25,287
LAURA: Can I tell where it's coming from?

2447
02:38:25,287 --> 02:38:29,659
MATT: It is coming from the front of you and to
the right, the chamber you haven't been able to

2448
02:38:29,659 --> 02:38:35,499
look past entirely, to the right. You glance about
in the entryway now that's open before you. There

2449
02:38:35,499 --> 02:38:41,320
does not appear to be any trapped mechanism in
front of you. There are areas where some of the

2450
02:38:41,320 --> 02:38:46,921
walls have caved in slightly. The ceiling is
solid, but there are portions where some of the

2451
02:38:46,921 --> 02:38:51,507
wall has come in, and you can see where rockslides
have come to rest on each side and filled in some

2452
02:38:51,507 --> 02:38:57,226
of the corners. There are piles of rags and other
wayward bits of materials that have been left

2453
02:38:57,226 --> 02:39:05,290
behind and left to rot or sit. There's an awful,
almost citrusy rot smell coming from one of the

2454
02:39:05,290 --> 02:39:06,824
far chambers on the left.

2455
02:39:06,824 --> 02:39:15,589
MARISHA: I drag in the human, escort him in, and
go ahead and light up my hands.

2456
02:39:15,589 --> 02:39:18,178
MATT: Your hands open up. Pike has?

2457
02:39:18,178 --> 02:39:19,515
LAURA: Her mace.

2458
02:39:19,515 --> 02:39:20,893
MATT: Her mace. Do you come in, as well?

2459
02:39:20,893 --> 02:39:21,873
SAM: Sure, yeah!

2460
02:39:21,873 --> 02:39:23,213
MATT: All right, so you all walk into the
chamber.

2461
02:39:23,213 --> 02:39:25,346
LAURA: I think there's an exit ahead and to the
right.

2462
02:39:25,346 --> 02:39:30,293
MATT: As you're glancing and doing your
investigation, looking around, to confirm that

2463
02:39:30,293 --> 02:39:35,635
this was once a vault that held quite a bit of
wealth, you look at the base of the wall-- the

2464
02:39:35,635 --> 02:39:40,061
parts that you can see that aren't buried-- and
you can see scrapes and grooves. Hundreds of them,

2465
02:39:40,061 --> 02:39:48,754
like there were once many coins and other heavy
metallic materials that were placed in here that

2466
02:39:48,754 --> 02:39:54,904
scraped against the stone as they were once on the
ground. About maybe three inches off the ground,

2467
02:39:54,904 --> 02:39:59,803
you can see this layer of metallic scrapes across
the stonework that this place once contained a

2468
02:39:59,803 --> 02:40:01,358
fair amount of wealth.

2469
02:40:01,358 --> 02:40:04,742
LIAM: So if dudes came in here and put stuff in
sacks, there wouldn't be scrapes.

2470
02:40:04,742 --> 02:40:11,327
MATT: You do notice grooves in places and signs
that this vault has already been largely raided,

2471
02:40:11,327 --> 02:40:18,192
of course; most everything in here has been taken.
Probably a long time ago, based on the center. You

2472
02:40:18,192 --> 02:40:26,531
do notice that one of the piles of rags begins to
twitch and shift ahead of you.

2473
02:40:26,531 --> 02:40:29,739
LIAM: Mini Jenga.

2474
02:40:29,739 --> 02:40:32,106
TRAVIS: Mini Jenga?

2475
02:40:32,106 --> 02:40:33,995
LIAM: Well, there's something under that.

2476
02:40:33,995 --> 02:40:37,550
LAURA: (whispering) Maybe you should kill it
before it says anything to you.

2477
02:40:37,550 --> 02:40:45,746
LIAM: Do you want to? I don't think it's a small
child down here.

2478
02:40:45,746 --> 02:40:48,837
TRAVIS: I've become Death, Destroyer of Worlds.

2479
02:40:48,837 --> 02:40:50,517
SAM: (whispering) Dagger, dagger, dagger!

2480
02:40:50,517 --> 02:40:52,669
LIAM: What do you want to do, Sis?

2481
02:40:52,669 --> 02:40:54,156
LAURA: I don't know. This is all you!

2482
02:40:54,156 --> 02:40:55,487
SAM: Kill it!

2483
02:40:55,487 --> 02:40:56,681
TALIESIN: Detect undead?

2484
02:40:56,681 --> 02:40:59,711
LIAM: I don't have much of that left. Yeah, my
last one, I'll use it.

2485
02:40:59,711 --> 02:41:00,948
MARISHA: Your last one?

2486
02:41:00,948 --> 02:41:03,601
LIAM: My last one. Detect undead, Divine Sense.

2487
02:41:03,601 --> 02:41:12,473
MATT: Okay, Divine Sense. The rag pile, it's
around this portion of rock and fallen debris.

2488
02:41:12,473 --> 02:41:17,522
Behind it, there's that pile of rags that's
shifting. The minute you focus, you sense that is

2489
02:41:17,522 --> 02:41:23,175
indeed a source of undead energy, and at that
point, the rags rise up and you see a very long,

2490
02:41:23,175 --> 02:41:29,213
greenish humanoid claw extend. As the rag falls
back, you see a familiar sight. You've encountered

2491
02:41:29,213 --> 02:41:35,070
trolls in the wild before, but these trolls appear
to be somewhat rotting, their flesh strangely

2492
02:41:35,070 --> 02:41:44,118
battling between decomposition and regeneration.
There's this shifting midpoint where its form and

2493
02:41:44,118 --> 02:41:50,842
whatever cursed enchantment is held within it or
disease that claims its body is battling its nature.

2494
02:41:50,842 --> 02:41:52,259
LIAM: How far away is it?

2495
02:41:52,259 --> 02:41:55,516
MATT: Well, right now, it's charging, and I need
you to roll initiative.

2496
02:41:55,516 --> 02:41:56,634
TRAVIS: Everybody?

2497
02:41:56,634 --> 02:41:57,688
MATT: Everybody.

2498
02:41:57,688 --> 02:41:58,907
LAURA: That fast?! Oh fuck.

2499
02:41:58,907 --> 02:42:01,922
MATT: It slowly emerged and then (snarling)
charged in your direction.

2500
02:42:01,922 --> 02:42:05,268
LIAM: Yay, maps!

2501
02:42:05,268 --> 02:42:09,300
SAM: He's using all the maps we didn't use in
Indianapolis!

2502
02:42:09,300 --> 02:42:11,313
ALL: (mockingly) Indianapolis!

2503
02:42:11,313 --> 02:42:12,974
SAM: I am drunk!

2504
02:42:12,974 --> 02:42:14,861
(laughter)

2505
02:42:14,861 --> 02:42:16,972
LAURA: Indianapolis!

2506
02:42:16,972 --> 02:42:18,431
LIAM: Look at all the gold!

2507
02:42:18,431 --> 02:42:22,481
MATT: So that's the rag side there. Vax would've
been right there.

2508
02:42:22,481 --> 02:42:27,351
LIAM: Look at this great tile work! I love Dwarven
Forge!

2509
02:42:27,351 --> 02:42:31,874
MATT: (singsong) They do good shit! If you guys'd
like to place yourselves--

2510
02:42:31,874 --> 02:42:35,189
SAM: Matt, will you leave all this stuff for me
when you go to Burning Man, so I can use it?

2511
02:42:35,189 --> 02:42:38,997
MATT: Talk to Dani; she's watching our house. You
can borrow whatever's in there.

2512
02:42:38,997 --> 02:42:40,346
SAM: Thanks.

2513
02:42:40,346 --> 02:42:42,402
MATT: All right, Grog.

2514
02:42:42,402 --> 02:42:44,208
LIAM: We are taking that bird.

2515
02:42:44,208 --> 02:42:46,788
MARISHA: You steal my bird, you die.

2516
02:42:46,788 --> 02:42:48,171
MATT: Vex?

2517
02:42:48,171 --> 02:42:49,915
LAURA: Oh, I guess I'd be next to--

2518
02:42:49,915 --> 02:42:53,729
MARISHA: You steal my bird, she will pluck your
eyes out.

2519
02:42:53,729 --> 02:42:56,910
LAURA: Bear is with Grog.

2520
02:42:56,910 --> 02:42:58,436
MATT: With Grog? Okay.

2521
02:42:58,436 --> 02:43:02,273
LAURA: Trinket really likes Grog.

2522
02:43:02,273 --> 02:43:05,948
MATT: And Scanlan? You just entered the chamber
behind everybody else.

2523
02:43:05,948 --> 02:43:09,656
SAM: What's going on in here, guys? (screaming)

2524
02:43:09,728 --> 02:43:15,693
LAURA: He's a big guy!

2525
02:43:15,693 --> 02:43:20,613
MATT: Right. 25 to 20?

2526
02:43:20,613 --> 02:43:21,931
LAURA: 24!

2527
02:43:21,931 --> 02:43:23,095
TALIESIN: 29.

2528
02:43:23,095 --> 02:43:26,753
LIAM: That's our Percival.

2529
02:43:26,753 --> 02:43:31,192
MATT: Always first. All right, and then Vex. 20 to
15?

2530
02:43:31,192 --> 02:43:32,380
LAURA: Oh, I didn't roll for Pike.

2531
02:43:32,380 --> 02:43:33,552
TRAVIS: 16.

2532
02:43:33,552 --> 02:43:34,661
LIAM: 15.

2533
02:43:34,661 --> 02:43:37,488
LAURA: Ooh! 16 for Pike.

2534
02:43:37,488 --> 02:43:40,406
MATT: Oh, all right. Pike's before Grog.

2535
02:43:40,406 --> 02:43:43,066
LIAM, MARISHA, and TRAVIS: Pickle wreck!

2536
02:43:43,066 --> 02:43:48,388
MARISHA: It's turned into a battle cry. Pickle
wreck!

2537
02:43:48,388 --> 02:43:50,896
MATT: All right, 15 to ten.

2538
02:43:50,896 --> 02:43:52,793
SAM: 11.

2539
02:43:52,793 --> 02:44:02,213
MATT: Ten to five? Keyleth, what did you get?

2540
02:44:02,213 --> 02:44:03,453
MARISHA: Three.

2541
02:44:03,453 --> 02:44:04,750
(groaning)

2542
02:44:04,750 --> 02:44:05,919
TRAVIS: What is going on?!

2543
02:44:05,919 --> 02:44:07,317
SAM: How did you do that?

2544
02:44:07,317 --> 02:44:09,619
MARISHA: I rolled a one, that's how. I rolled a
one.

2545
02:44:09,619 --> 02:44:14,262
MATT: Top of the round. Percival, you watch as
something underneath this rag pile suddenly

2546
02:44:14,262 --> 02:44:19,501
emerges and then darts around the edge. You see
it's rushing towards Vax'ildan.

2547
02:44:19,501 --> 02:44:20,693
What are you doing?

2548
02:44:20,693 --> 02:44:21,931
TALIESIN: I'm shooting it in the foot.

2549
02:44:21,931 --> 02:44:22,858
MATT: Go for it.

2550
02:44:22,858 --> 02:44:34,815
TALIESIN: So I'm actually making this a leg shot.
Burning that. That's a 22?

2551
02:44:34,815 --> 02:44:37,415
MATT: 22? All right, 22 hits.

2552
02:44:37,415 --> 02:44:41,839
TRAVIS: What are you shooting it with?

2553
02:44:41,839 --> 02:44:51,388
TALIESIN: With a gun. Oh, that's nice. Yeah,
that's 17 points of damage, plus five psychic. And

2554
02:44:51,388 --> 02:44:55,078
it has to make a strength saving throw.

2555
02:44:55,078 --> 02:45:00,525
MATT: That is a 20. What is your--

2556
02:45:00,525 --> 02:45:01,735
TALIESIN: 20.

2557
02:45:01,735 --> 02:45:02,885
MATT: So it succeeds.

2558
02:45:02,885 --> 02:45:10,985
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. That's fine. I'm going to
shoot it in the foot again, because that's what we do.

2559
02:45:10,985 --> 02:45:13,124
MATT: That's cocked.

2560
02:45:13,124 --> 02:45:16,366
TALIESIN: Is that cocked? Goddamn it.

2561
02:45:16,366 --> 02:45:17,836
MARISHA: It was so close.

2562
02:45:17,836 --> 02:45:21,090
TALIESIN: I know. That's okay. That's an 18. 24.

2563
02:45:21,090 --> 02:45:22,231
MATT: 24 hits.

2564
02:45:22,231 --> 02:45:23,496
MARISHA: You almost critted.

2565
02:45:23,496 --> 02:45:31,149
TALIESIN: I know. That's ten points of damage,
plus five psychic. And again: strength saving throw.

2566
02:45:31,149 --> 02:45:36,129
MATT: That is a 23.

2567
02:45:36,129 --> 02:45:37,522
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

2568
02:45:37,522 --> 02:45:40,741
MATT: Natural 16. And pretty strong.

2569
02:45:40,741 --> 02:45:50,425
TALIESIN: That's all right. And to make life a
little more fun, let's take a head shot, because

2570
02:45:50,425 --> 02:46:00,689
obviously he doesn't want to go down. And that's a
25. That hits. That's one more of those and one

2571
02:46:00,689 --> 02:46:11,294
more of these. And that's 11 points of damage,
plus three psychic. 14 points of damage and a

2572
02:46:11,294 --> 02:46:14,373
constitution saving throw.

2573
02:46:14,373 --> 02:46:17,469
MATT: All righty. Wow, that's a 26.

2574
02:46:17,469 --> 02:46:28,499
TALIESIN: Holy fuck! Never-goddamn-mind. And with
that, I'm going to dart in back behind Keyleth.

2575
02:46:28,499 --> 02:46:32,830
MARISHA: Wow. That was rough, buddy. I'm sorry.

2576
02:46:32,830 --> 02:46:37,994
TALIESIN: Is that as far back as I can get? Yeah.
And I'll use my bonus to reload.

2577
02:46:37,994 --> 02:46:39,946
MATT: All righty. That ends Percival's turn. Vex,
you're up.

2578
02:46:39,946 --> 02:46:41,132
LAURA: Hunter's Mark!

2579
02:46:41,132 --> 02:46:42,424
MATT: All right. Who are you marking? That guy?

2580
02:46:42,424 --> 02:46:43,603
LAURA: That troll that I see.

2581
02:46:43,603 --> 02:46:44,998
MATT: That's right. There is the one troll.

2582
02:46:44,998 --> 02:46:47,089
LAURA: I'm going to Hunter's Mark Grog.

2583
02:46:47,089 --> 02:46:48,526
MATT: Yeah. And there you go.

2584
02:46:48,526 --> 02:46:50,829
LAURA: Okay. And I'm going to shoot him.

2585
02:46:50,829 --> 02:46:51,926
MATT: Go for it.

2586
02:46:51,926 --> 02:46:53,959
LAURA: With a natural one.

2587
02:46:53,959 --> 02:46:59,870
MATT: With a natural one! So as you mark him, you
pull out the first arrow and you yank backward,

2588
02:46:59,870 --> 02:47:06,294
and as the arrow string tenses, the actual shaft
seems to snap in place. The arrow had somehow

2589
02:47:06,294 --> 02:47:10,693
dry-rotted through your travels. Chuck it at the
ground and pull another.

2590
02:47:10,693 --> 02:47:18,467
LAURA: Okay, this one is going to be sharpshooter
with Blazing Bowstring, so hopefully-- goddamn it!

2591
02:47:18,467 --> 02:47:19,720
What the fuck?

2592
02:47:19,720 --> 02:47:21,033
LIAM: Oh! Two!

2593
02:47:21,033 --> 02:47:22,035
TRAVIS: That's a two.

2594
02:47:22,035 --> 02:47:23,846
MATT: All right. So what's the total bonus on that
one?

2595
02:47:23,846 --> 02:47:25,207
MARISHA: What is happening to us?

2596
02:47:25,207 --> 02:47:27,984
LAURA: Oh my god, that's 11 to hit.

2597
02:47:27,984 --> 02:47:29,659
MATT: Yeah, that missed. Sorry.

2598
02:47:29,659 --> 02:47:31,643
LAURA: Jesus H. Macy!

2599
02:47:31,643 --> 02:47:35,089
MATT: So the first arrow shatters in place, then
pull out the second one and go to fire, and as you

2600
02:47:35,089 --> 02:47:38,995
strike, the arrow seems like it should hit it, but
instead it hits one of the rags over its shoulder

2601
02:47:38,995 --> 02:47:43,145
that makes it look like its mass is larger than it
is, and it passes through harmlessly, causing the

2602
02:47:43,145 --> 02:47:49,892
rag to flutter off, revealing its shoulder. You
can see the bits of greenish muscle and sinew

2603
02:47:49,892 --> 02:47:56,950
showing up beneath one of the gashes of its rotted
shoulder. You're going to move or Trinket can move?

2604
02:47:56,950 --> 02:48:00,574
LAURA: Can I climb up those rocks behind me and
stand on the top of them?

2605
02:48:00,574 --> 02:48:05,010
MATT: Sure. On top of the rocks there, getting
ready to fire.

2606
02:48:05,010 --> 02:48:15,483
LAURA: And then Trinket is going to run over and
stand next to Pike. He's going to try to protect us.

2607
02:48:15,483 --> 02:48:18,245
MATT: There you go. All righty.

2608
02:48:18,245 --> 02:48:22,376
LAURA: Can he move far enough to be on the other
side of her?

2609
02:48:22,376 --> 02:48:25,591
MATT: Nope. What's his movement? Is it 30 or 40?

2610
02:48:25,591 --> 02:48:26,709
LAURA: 40.

2611
02:48:26,709 --> 02:48:28,225
MATT: 40? He could, actually.

2612
02:48:28,225 --> 02:48:29,904
LAURA: Yeah, he goes to the other side.

2613
02:48:29,904 --> 02:48:36,544
MATT: He can move over there. Perfect. All right.
Ending your turn. Pike's up next.

2614
02:48:36,544 --> 02:48:45,077
LIAM: (impact) Kind of a gooch-smashing day, so
she's going to walk right up to him and slam it

2615
02:48:45,077 --> 02:48:47,238
right into his junk, yeah?

2616
02:48:47,238 --> 02:48:49,392
LAURA: Really, that's what she's going to do?

2617
02:48:49,392 --> 02:48:50,593
LIAM: That is what she's going to do.

2618
02:48:50,593 --> 02:48:52,717
LAURA: I guess it's undead. She can't try to turn
undead?

2619
02:48:52,717 --> 02:48:56,978
LIAM: Well, if she wants to use one of three
channel divinities for today.

2620
02:48:56,978 --> 02:48:58,781
LAURA: Fine.

2621
02:48:58,781 --> 02:49:00,716
LIAM: She's hitting him in the gooch.

2622
02:49:00,716 --> 02:49:04,568
LAURA: 23!

2623
02:49:04,568 --> 02:49:05,435
LIAM: 23 to hit.

2624
02:49:05,435 --> 02:49:06,353
MATT: That hits!

2625
02:49:06,353 --> 02:49:07,227
LIAM: All right.

2626
02:49:07,227 --> 02:49:08,334
LAURA: Great. Good.

2627
02:49:08,334 --> 02:49:18,849
LIAM: Plus the what's it called? Divine Strike, so
three plus four is seven, plus the 2d8. That ain't

2628
02:49:18,849 --> 02:49:25,849
a d8. That's 13. 21. To the gooch.

2629
02:49:25,849 --> 02:49:30,682
MATT: Nice. (impact) She runs up and slams it with
the side of the mace. As it hits, you can see

2630
02:49:30,682 --> 02:49:32,784
there's a flash of radiant energy and it burns
away some of the--

2631
02:49:32,784 --> 02:49:35,421
LAURA: It takes an additional 2d6 radiant because
he's undead.

2632
02:49:35,421 --> 02:49:44,713
LIAM: Yes! That's right. Fiend or undead take
extra 2d6 radiant damage.

2633
02:49:44,713 --> 02:49:46,859
LAURA: With her Mace of Disruption.

2634
02:49:46,859 --> 02:49:48,766
MATT: Correct. What's the additional damage?

2635
02:49:48,766 --> 02:49:51,555
LIAM: Whatever I just told you.

2636
02:49:51,555 --> 02:49:52,689
SAM: 21.

2637
02:49:52,689 --> 02:49:53,928
LIAM: And now I'm going to roll for that extra--

2638
02:49:53,928 --> 02:49:55,055
LAURA: I just did; it's seven.

2639
02:49:55,055 --> 02:49:57,032
MATT: What was the first damage roll you did to do
21 points of damage to her?

2640
02:49:57,032 --> 02:49:59,073
LIAM: That was the Mace of Disruption.

2641
02:49:59,073 --> 02:50:01,201
LAURA: 2d6 plus four radiant damage.

2642
02:50:01,201 --> 02:50:06,483
LIAM: Plus Divine Strike. Once on each turn, add
2d8 of weapon damage to your damage total.

2643
02:50:06,483 --> 02:50:10,671
LAURA: So that's what all he rolled, and then
since it's undead, it's an additional 2d6.

2644
02:50:10,671 --> 02:50:18,348
MATT: Yeah, 2d8. Yeah. Fuck yeah! All righty.

2645
02:50:18,348 --> 02:50:20,862
LAURA: An additional seven because he's undead.

2646
02:50:20,862 --> 02:50:22,959
TRAVIS: So 28 total.

2647
02:50:22,959 --> 02:50:24,671
LIAM: (gun cocking) Gooch shot.

2648
02:50:24,671 --> 02:50:32,687
MATT: That is actually pretty damn nasty. Worth
doing cleric.

2649
02:50:32,687 --> 02:50:34,649
LIAM: She needs to jump up to hit it.

2650
02:50:34,649 --> 02:50:35,924
TRAVIS: She's at 18, right?

2651
02:50:35,924 --> 02:50:39,237
LIAM: What's at 18?

2652
02:50:39,237 --> 02:50:40,219
TRAVIS: Pike.

2653
02:50:40,219 --> 02:50:44,128
LIAM: We're not sure. 17 or 18. Real life is
hazy.

2654
02:50:44,128 --> 02:50:49,008
MATT: She can use a bonus action to hit again if
she wants. That's one of her war domain abilities.

2655
02:50:49,008 --> 02:50:50,213
LAURA: Whoa, fuck yeah!

2656
02:50:50,213 --> 02:50:51,669
LIAM: Double gooch shot!

2657
02:50:51,669 --> 02:50:52,954
LAURA: One for each.

2658
02:50:52,954 --> 02:50:57,305
LIAM: Keep looking at mine. Same thing.
23.

2659
02:50:57,305 --> 02:50:59,353
MATT: All right, 23 hits. Roll damage again.

2660
02:50:59,353 --> 02:51:14,862
LIAM: (counting) 12 and then the radiant damage.
2d6. So we're at 12 plus five plus-- no, once per

2661
02:51:14,862 --> 02:51:16,260
turn. 17.

2662
02:51:16,260 --> 02:51:23,833
MATT: 17 damage? All righty. So a second hit
slams, and you could see the first one where it

2663
02:51:23,833 --> 02:51:29,737
burst out, burned and singed the necrotic flash.
The second one hits, not as impactful but still,

2664
02:51:29,737 --> 02:51:32,123
it looks relatively hurt. That ends Pike's go.

2665
02:51:32,123 --> 02:51:36,214
LAURA: Can't she move away from him? Oh, no,
because he will get an attack.

2666
02:51:36,214 --> 02:51:39,585
MATT: She could move back five, but it will get an
attack of opportunity if she does that.

2667
02:51:39,585 --> 02:51:41,014
LIAM: No, she's going to face him down.

2668
02:51:41,014 --> 02:51:42,312
MATT: Okay. Grog, you're up.

2669
02:51:42,312 --> 02:51:51,069
TRAVIS: I would like to rage and run up and to
this doorway. Five, 10, 15, 20. Can I see anything

2670
02:51:51,069 --> 02:51:52,455
in this room?

2671
02:51:52,455 --> 02:51:53,636
MATT: Make a perception check.

2672
02:51:53,636 --> 02:51:56,364
TRAVIS: Okay. Five.

2673
02:51:56,364 --> 02:51:57,478
MATT: Nope.

2674
02:51:57,478 --> 02:52:04,767
TRAVIS: Yep. I don't see anything. Oh, do I feel
anything from the black metallic hammer that I'm

2675
02:52:04,767 --> 02:52:06,032
holding?

2676
02:52:06,032 --> 02:52:07,874
LAURA: Oh yeah, you've been trying to attune to
it.

2677
02:52:07,874 --> 02:52:10,617
MATT: I don't think you've had time yet to fully
attune to it.

2678
02:52:10,617 --> 02:52:12,918
TALIESIN: He started attuning to it before the
break.

2679
02:52:12,918 --> 02:52:15,308
(laughter)

2680
02:52:15,308 --> 02:52:16,889
LIAM: It's a half hour ago, at this point.

2681
02:52:16,889 --> 02:52:19,021
SAM: The break doesn't exist.

2682
02:52:19,021 --> 02:52:20,510
TRAVIS: It's not really enough time. Okay.

2683
02:52:20,510 --> 02:52:22,734
LAURA: He started attuning to it as soon as Percy
felt something from the belt, so if it's

2684
02:52:22,734 --> 02:52:24,318
been long enough?

2685
02:52:24,318 --> 02:52:25,858
LIAM: You can say no.

2686
02:52:25,858 --> 02:52:27,282
TRAVIS: I'm going to keep coming in here.

2687
02:52:27,282 --> 02:52:28,126
MATT: Sure.

2688
02:52:28,126 --> 02:52:29,264
TRAVIS: Really?

2689
02:52:29,264 --> 02:52:31,031
MATT: If you want to, I'll let you attune to it.

2690
02:52:31,031 --> 02:52:35,998
TRAVIS: Yeah? I'll attune to it. I want to attune
to it first.

2691
02:52:35,998 --> 02:52:37,469
LIAM: You go blind.

2692
02:52:37,469 --> 02:52:38,639
SAM: Insta-death.

2693
02:52:38,639 --> 02:52:40,166
MATT: Okay. Go ahead.

2694
02:52:40,166 --> 02:52:41,809
LAURA: Are you going to attack the guy with it?

2695
02:52:41,809 --> 02:52:43,324
TRAVIS: Well, I don't see anything in the room,
right?

2696
02:52:43,324 --> 02:52:44,798
MATT: You don't see anything in the room.

2697
02:52:44,798 --> 02:52:45,958
TRAVIS: Can I make my way through here?

2698
02:52:45,958 --> 02:52:46,816
MATT: You may.

2699
02:52:46,816 --> 02:52:47,710
TRAVIS: Okay.

2700
02:52:47,710 --> 02:52:49,593
LIAM: (whispering) Grog, I'm so glad we're
together at last.

2701
02:52:49,593 --> 02:52:51,528
MARISHA: Starts talking to him <i>again</i>.

2702
02:52:51,528 --> 02:52:56,109
TALIESIN: What if it heals him? He hits him so
hard it actually puts health points back into him.

2703
02:52:56,109 --> 02:52:58,492
MARISHA: It's Craven Edge. He just got a
make-over.

2704
02:52:58,492 --> 02:52:59,994
TRAVIS: Can I make a reckless attack against him?

2705
02:52:59,994 --> 02:53:00,986
MATT: You may.

2706
02:53:00,986 --> 02:53:02,053
TALIESIN: Craven Head.

2707
02:53:02,053 --> 02:53:06,137
TRAVIS: Craven Head. That's not great. 22.

2708
02:53:06,137 --> 02:53:07,448
MATT: What was the natural roll?

2709
02:53:07,448 --> 02:53:08,767
TRAVIS: A six.

2710
02:53:08,767 --> 02:53:13,716
MATT: A six? As you swing the hammer, go ahead and
roll damage.

2711
02:53:13,716 --> 02:53:20,520
LAURA: Oh no. This is something weird.

2712
02:53:20,520 --> 02:53:23,957
TRAVIS: 23.

2713
02:53:23,957 --> 02:53:30,021
MATT: You suffer 23 points of bludgeoning damage
as you swing and clobber yourself across the face

2714
02:53:30,021 --> 02:53:31,304
with the hammer.

2715
02:53:31,304 --> 02:53:32,914
SAM and TALIESIN: What?

2716
02:53:32,914 --> 02:53:35,098
TRAVIS: I'm drunk. (laughs)

2717
02:53:35,098 --> 02:53:37,829
LAURA: Is it like if you roll below a certain
thing you hit yourself instead?

2718
02:53:37,829 --> 02:53:42,469
TRAVIS: 23, so half of that is 12. 11.

2719
02:53:42,469 --> 02:53:46,659
MATT: So you pull back and (whack). You're taken
aback by it.

2720
02:53:46,659 --> 02:53:49,195
TALIESIN: I'm so amused.

2721
02:53:49,195 --> 02:53:55,345
TRAVIS: I try again.

2722
02:53:55,345 --> 02:53:56,901
MATT: Roll for an attack.

2723
02:53:56,901 --> 02:53:58,403
LAURA: Oh my god, roll high!

2724
02:53:58,403 --> 02:53:59,968
TRAVIS: Reckless, great weapon master.

2725
02:53:59,968 --> 02:54:02,337
MARISHA: Why do you always get the fucked-up
weapon?

2726
02:54:02,337 --> 02:54:03,887
TRAVIS: Natural 20!

2727
02:54:03,887 --> 02:54:05,282
MATT: Okay.

2728
02:54:05,282 --> 02:54:06,965
MARISHA: This is going to knock him out.

2729
02:54:06,965 --> 02:54:08,372
MATT: Roll damage.

2730
02:54:08,372 --> 02:54:11,579
LIAM: Finally, an enemy that can kill Grog.

2731
02:54:11,579 --> 02:54:14,361
TRAVIS: I've been doing a d12. Is that appropriate
for the hammer?

2732
02:54:14,361 --> 02:54:16,358
MATT: No, did you do a d12 last time?

2733
02:54:16,358 --> 02:54:18,339
TRAVIS: Yeah. So I'd to do a d10?

2734
02:54:18,339 --> 02:54:19,878
MATT: For the warhammer.

2735
02:54:19,878 --> 02:54:21,004
TRAVIS: Two-handed.

2736
02:54:21,004 --> 02:54:26,064
MATT: Warhammer is 1d8, but if you're a versatile
two-handed, it's a d10.

2737
02:54:26,064 --> 02:54:27,244
TRAVIS: Let's do that.

2738
02:54:27,244 --> 02:54:33,989
MATT: So. It's fine for the last one. Since you
took it to the face.

2739
02:54:33,989 --> 02:54:36,143
TALIESIN: That'd be amazing!

2740
02:54:36,143 --> 02:54:39,627
LIAM: No, it wouldn't.

2741
02:54:39,627 --> 02:54:45,153
TRAVIS: 22, 32. 38.

2742
02:54:45,153 --> 02:54:47,399
(laughter)

2743
02:54:47,399 --> 02:54:48,504
TRAVIS: 39.

2744
02:54:48,504 --> 02:54:49,512
MATT: 39?

2745
02:54:49,512 --> 02:54:50,673
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2746
02:54:50,673 --> 02:54:51,851
SAM: That's with the double?

2747
02:54:51,851 --> 02:54:53,978
LAURA: Wait, you forgot to add stuff?

2748
02:54:53,978 --> 02:54:55,174
TRAVIS: Yeah, hold on.

2749
02:54:55,174 --> 02:54:56,060
SAM: It's a crit, right?

2750
02:54:56,060 --> 02:54:57,205
LIAM: Double the dice.

2751
02:54:57,205 --> 02:54:59,570
TRAVIS: 46.

2752
02:54:59,570 --> 02:55:06,105
MATT: 46, okay. So you reach back with the hammer
after shaking your head, and with a giant, angry

2753
02:55:06,105 --> 02:55:12,567
yell, (yelling) the hammer comes down and cracks
into the face of the troll, causing its head to

2754
02:55:12,567 --> 02:55:19,669
push into its ribcage, and it falls to the
ground.

2755
02:55:19,669 --> 02:55:21,956
LAURA: He's going to get back up.

2756
02:55:21,956 --> 02:55:29,583
MATT: No, it does not make its saving throw. It
falls to the ground, unmoving. Crushed.

2757
02:55:29,583 --> 02:55:32,815
TRAVIS: That was better. Ow.

2758
02:55:32,815 --> 02:55:34,043
MATT: All right, is that your turn, Grog?

2759
02:55:34,043 --> 02:55:35,350
TRAVIS: That is.

2760
02:55:35,350 --> 02:55:36,518
MATT: Vax, you're up.

2761
02:55:36,518 --> 02:55:37,484
LIAM: So next I'm up?

2762
02:55:37,484 --> 02:55:38,512
MATT: Yeah.

2763
02:55:38,512 --> 02:55:40,029
TALIESIN: Oh, that other room.

2764
02:55:40,029 --> 02:55:42,149
LAURA: Is there other shit in there?

2765
02:55:42,149 --> 02:55:43,419
TALIESIN: We don't know what's in there.

2766
02:55:43,419 --> 02:56:00,434
LIAM: Right. I'm going to move past Pike, past the
troll, and hold my action should anything come

2767
02:56:00,434 --> 02:56:01,851
from that room.

2768
02:56:01,851 --> 02:56:03,296
MATT: Okay, what are you holding?

2769
02:56:03,296 --> 02:56:07,362
LIAM: If I see a creature running at any of us,
I'm going to throw.

2770
02:56:07,362 --> 02:56:13,227
MATT: Okay, good to know. That ends your turn,
holding your action. Rushing around the corner

2771
02:56:13,227 --> 02:56:26,961
immediately, you hear this (growling) as these
black-drooling undead trolls, their eyes like a

2772
02:56:26,961 --> 02:56:36,670
jet-black bead, hints of light hitting the shine
of it, like shark eyes. This one rushes past.

2773
02:56:36,670 --> 02:56:38,949
LAURA: He goes for Keyleth?

2774
02:56:38,949 --> 02:56:44,902
MATT: Right up to there. And then this one, here.
Go ahead.

2775
02:56:44,902 --> 02:56:46,726
LIAM: Yeah. (dagger noises) Okay.

2776
02:56:46,726 --> 02:56:49,119
TALIESIN: Fuck shit up.

2777
02:56:49,119 --> 02:56:55,941
LIAM: I'm going before them in the order. Does
that mean I get advantage, due to assassin?

2778
02:56:55,941 --> 02:57:01,197
MATT: No, because this is their turn. You're
reacting to their action.

2779
02:57:01,197 --> 02:57:03,169
LIAM: Cool,. 25 for the first.

2780
02:57:03,169 --> 02:57:04,056
MATT: Hits.

2781
02:57:04,056 --> 02:57:06,007
LIAM: Okay. Second is a 25.

2782
02:57:06,007 --> 02:57:07,061
MATT: Hits.

2783
02:57:07,061 --> 02:57:08,712
LIAM: Third is a 15.

2784
02:57:08,712 --> 02:57:10,667
MATT: You don't get a bonus action, because this
is only an action you held.

2785
02:57:10,667 --> 02:57:11,910
LIAM: Oh, okay. Cool.

2786
02:57:11,910 --> 02:57:15,208
MATT: Which I probably forgot that earlier; it's
fine.

2787
02:57:15,208 --> 02:57:18,002
LIAM: Right, so what did I say for the first two?

2788
02:57:18,002 --> 02:57:19,667
MATT: They both hit.

2789
02:57:19,667 --> 02:57:27,970
LIAM: Okay, cool. But no sneak attack at all, so
here they come. First one is 11, plus psychic

2790
02:57:27,970 --> 02:57:36,545
damage is 17 for the first, and the second one is
15 for the second. 17 and 15.

2791
02:57:36,545 --> 02:57:38,209
MATT: 17 and 15?

2792
02:57:38,209 --> 02:57:40,418
LAURA: Those are good attacks without sneak
attack.

2793
02:57:40,418 --> 02:57:47,919
MATT: So as it turns around the corner (snarling)
and it goes into a sprint towards you, rushing

2794
02:57:47,919 --> 02:57:53,516
forward, it's going to go ahead and attack you
twice with its claws and one with its bite. The

2795
02:57:53,516 --> 02:57:56,042
claw attack is 20.

2796
02:57:56,042 --> 02:57:56,963
LIAM: No.

2797
02:57:56,963 --> 02:58:04,649
MATT: You dodge out of the first claw. It strikes
upward with its other hand. That is a 22.

2798
02:58:04,649 --> 02:58:07,623
LIAM: That does hit. I'll use Uncanny Dodge on
it.

2799
02:58:07,623 --> 02:58:17,591
MATT: Okay. 17 points of slashing damage reduced
to eight. Eight points slashing damage, and its

2800
02:58:17,591 --> 02:58:20,032
bite attack. That's a natural 20.

2801
02:58:20,032 --> 02:58:21,924
LIAM: That hits.

2802
02:58:21,924 --> 02:58:29,200
MATT: However, it only rolled a one on the damage.
You take six points of piercing damage, and I need

2803
02:58:29,200 --> 02:58:30,904
you to make a constitution saving throw.

2804
02:58:30,904 --> 02:58:35,993
LIAM: Balls. Okay. (singing) Don't fail me, Raven
Queen, like you've done so many times before.

2805
02:58:35,993 --> 02:58:38,217
(speaking) That is a 17.

2806
02:58:38,217 --> 02:58:41,414
MATT: Did you drop it, or did you roll it
intentionally?

2807
02:58:41,414 --> 02:58:45,083
LIAM: What do you mean? I'll roll it again, if you
want. I don't care. I'm rolling it again! That's

2808
02:58:45,083 --> 02:58:47,865
way worse: nine.

2809
02:58:47,865 --> 02:58:49,474
TRAVIS: It looked like he dropped it.

2810
02:58:49,474 --> 02:58:54,419
MATT: It looked like you dropped it. Okay. Good to
know. All right. So then the other one that's

2811
02:58:54,419 --> 02:58:59,730
rushing up to you, Keyleth, is going to attack
you, as well. That is a 17 to hit?

2812
02:58:59,730 --> 02:59:01,293
MARISHA: Yeah, that hits.

2813
02:59:01,293 --> 02:59:05,519
SAM: I'm going to use Cutting Words to take that
down.

2814
02:59:05,519 --> 02:59:06,928
MARISHA: Oh, thanks, man.

2815
02:59:06,928 --> 02:59:16,455
SAM: That's all right. I will yell at the troll:
Oi, troll, I would kick your ass, but I don't want

2816
02:59:16,455 --> 02:59:18,486
troll shit on my foot.

2817
02:59:18,486 --> 02:59:20,213
(laughter)

2818
02:59:20,213 --> 02:59:22,802
MATT: Go ahead and roll your d12.

2819
02:59:22,802 --> 02:59:24,773
TRAVIS: We know, baby.

2820
02:59:24,773 --> 02:59:26,107
LIAM: You've just peaked, Sam.

2821
02:59:26,107 --> 02:59:28,203
SAM: Eight.

2822
02:59:28,203 --> 02:59:32,542
MATT: Yeah. So with that enough of a distraction,
his head turns to you over her shoulder, and the

2823
02:59:32,542 --> 02:59:34,920
swing goes wide. Second claw strike.

2824
02:59:34,920 --> 02:59:41,591
MARISHA: Only because I turn around at Scanlan and
go: (laughs) That's good. Aw, yeah.

2825
02:59:41,591 --> 02:59:44,138
MATT: Which is just enough for it to roll a 19 on
its second attack with the claw.

2826
02:59:44,138 --> 02:59:46,330
MARISHA: And I go: Ugh! Yeah.

2827
02:59:46,330 --> 02:59:52,390
MATT: Which deals 14 points of slashing damage,
and it's going to go in for a bite after the claw

2828
02:59:52,390 --> 02:59:56,136
strikes at you and grabs your shoulder and it
pulls you in. Its troll mouth almost seems to

2829
02:59:56,136 --> 03:00:02,332
hyperextend as it snaps down towards your
shoulder. That is a 22.

2830
03:00:02,332 --> 03:00:04,349
MARISHA: Not the mantle! Yeah, that hits.

2831
03:00:04,349 --> 03:00:08,738
MATT: All right. You take eight points of piercing
damage, and make a constitution saving throw.

2832
03:00:08,738 --> 03:00:11,083
SAM: Constitution saving throw.

2833
03:00:11,083 --> 03:00:12,549
LIAM: Let me take my antlers off.

2834
03:00:12,549 --> 03:00:18,031
MARISHA: Hold my antlers! Yeah, that's good. 19.

2835
03:00:18,031 --> 03:00:18,976
MATT: Okay.

2836
03:00:18,976 --> 03:00:20,197
TRAVIS: Hold my antlers, girl.

2837
03:00:20,197 --> 03:00:22,327
MARISHA: Okay?

2838
03:00:22,327 --> 03:00:29,981
MATT: That brings us to the one. So the one on the
ground that had been slaughtered by Pike, its

2839
03:00:29,981 --> 03:00:35,356
wounds seem to heal up slightly, and as it gets up
from the ground, it's going to strike out towards

2840
03:00:35,356 --> 03:00:44,071
Pike. Getting up from prone. So the first strike
is-- that's cocked. That is 24 to hit.

2841
03:00:44,071 --> 03:00:45,278
LIAM: Yes.

2842
03:00:45,278 --> 03:00:48,845
MATT: All right. She takes eight points of
slashing damage.

2843
03:00:48,845 --> 03:00:50,012
LIAM: Okay.

2844
03:00:50,012 --> 03:00:53,290
MATT: Second attack is (counting) 25.

2845
03:00:53,290 --> 03:00:56,006
LAURA: No, 25 to hit.

2846
03:00:56,006 --> 03:00:57,332
LIAM: That hits, yeah.

2847
03:00:57,332 --> 03:01:01,229
MATT: Ten points of slashing damage, and as it
grabs both sides of her armor, it's going to

2848
03:01:01,229 --> 03:01:05,229
actually lift her off the ground and pull her
towards its mouth. Its jaw (snarling) opens up to

2849
03:01:05,229 --> 03:01:09,693
almost alligator-chomp down on her. The sides of
its mouth almost curve back towards its neck.

2850
03:01:09,693 --> 03:01:11,133
LIAM: That's fucked up, Matt.

2851
03:01:11,133 --> 03:01:17,687
MATT: That is going to be a seven plus nine, a 16,
which I don't believe-- she brings her shield up

2852
03:01:17,687 --> 03:01:22,130
just in place, and as the top jaw comes down on
the edge of her shoulder armor, the shield takes

2853
03:01:22,130 --> 03:01:26,686
the bottom jaw, and she just manages to wrestle it
off of her and land on her feet, unscathed by the

2854
03:01:26,686 --> 03:01:30,854
bite. That's going to end their turn. Scanlan,
you're up.

2855
03:01:30,854 --> 03:01:37,649
SAM: Me? Oh god. I'm not wasting my shit on them.

2856
03:01:37,649 --> 03:01:41,638
LAURA: I know. That's the problem. None of us want
to do anything.

2857
03:01:41,638 --> 03:01:45,124
LIAM: Yeah. We're just going to slog. Slog it out,
man, slog it out.

2858
03:01:45,124 --> 03:01:48,530
(laughter)

2859
03:01:48,530 --> 03:01:51,407
MATT: So you're moving up to this guy?

2860
03:01:51,407 --> 03:01:52,577
SAM: Yeah.

2861
03:01:52,577 --> 03:01:55,497
MATT: All righty. There you go.

2862
03:01:55,497 --> 03:01:56,967
TRAVIS: Come on, 20!

2863
03:01:56,967 --> 03:02:09,322
SAM: 16. That's a 26 to hit. Yeah, 1d8! Three!
Plus four, that's seven. Oh, but wait, there's

2864
03:02:09,322 --> 03:02:14,503
more! Plus four. 11 points of damage.

2865
03:02:14,503 --> 03:02:19,389
MATT: 11 points of damage. As you rush up and slip
it right into the sternum of the troll creature,

2866
03:02:19,389 --> 03:02:25,930
it goes through and points out the other side. It
goes (snarl). You pull it out.

2867
03:02:25,930 --> 03:02:34,379
SAM: Like a matador, I turn my back to him,
because I don't think he can hit me. I don't think

2868
03:02:34,379 --> 03:02:35,964
he's got it in him.

2869
03:02:35,964 --> 03:02:38,746
MATT: Perfect! Percival, you're up.

2870
03:02:38,746 --> 03:02:45,564
TALIESIN: That one that just got up is irritating
me, so I'm going to start by shooting him in the face.

2871
03:02:45,564 --> 03:02:46,733
LIAM: Yes, please.

2872
03:02:46,733 --> 03:02:52,642
TALIESIN: That's irritating. So that's a 32 to
hit.

2873
03:02:52,642 --> 03:02:54,533
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2874
03:02:54,533 --> 03:03:00,347
TALIESIN: That's 12 points of damage plus five
psychic, so 17 points of damage.

2875
03:03:00,347 --> 03:03:08,101
MATT: 17 points of damage. All right. So as you
hit it, (gunshot) you blow a large chunk out of

2876
03:03:08,101 --> 03:03:13,574
its side, a wound that should have knocked it
down, and it still stands and looks towards you

2877
03:03:13,574 --> 03:03:15,500
(growling).

2878
03:03:15,500 --> 03:03:28,826
TALIESIN: That's irritating. All right. Hitting it
again. That's 26 to hit. And that's, ugh! Nine

2879
03:03:28,826 --> 03:03:31,478
points of damage and one psychic. That's ten
points of damage.

2880
03:03:31,478 --> 03:03:37,863
MATT: All right. Ten points of damage. (chuckles)
Once again, another shot (gunshot) blows out part

2881
03:03:37,863 --> 03:03:41,045
of its ribcage, and you see organs (slurping) slop
out onto the ground, and it--

2882
03:03:41,045 --> 03:03:45,975
TALIESIN: For fuck's sake. Are we missing
something here?

2883
03:03:45,975 --> 03:03:50,254
LAURA: They're regenerating. Something's holding
them together.

2884
03:03:50,254 --> 03:03:54,637
LIAM: Well, it could be their version of Death
Ward.

2885
03:03:54,637 --> 03:03:56,691
TALIESIN: Yeah, fine, all right. I'm taking a
third shot on that one.

2886
03:03:56,691 --> 03:03:59,087
MARISHA: Is it we're going to have to do radiant
damage?

2887
03:03:59,087 --> 03:04:00,670
MATT: You've fought trolls before.

2888
03:04:00,670 --> 03:04:03,898
SAM: I don't remember them. When were they?

2889
03:04:03,898 --> 03:04:07,711
MARISHA: That was a long time ago.

2890
03:04:07,711 --> 03:04:10,033
TRAVIS: Doesn't fire work on trolls?

2891
03:04:10,033 --> 03:04:12,715
LIAM: Fire does work on trolls, yes.

2892
03:04:12,715 --> 03:04:17,653
LAURA: That's why I was hoping my bowstrings would
work, but I missed my shot.

2893
03:04:17,653 --> 03:04:20,055
TRAVIS: Well, that was dumb.

2894
03:04:20,055 --> 03:04:24,668
TALIESIN: Well, irritated by that one, I'm going
to turn my attention to the one that's bothering

2895
03:04:24,668 --> 03:04:32,721
Keyleth and Scanlan, and I'm going to take a
headshot at it. Burning grit, because fuck it, it

2896
03:04:32,721 --> 03:04:38,437
regenerates. Let's take a headshot. And that's 32
to hit.

2897
03:04:38,437 --> 03:04:39,950
MATT: That'll hit.

2898
03:04:39,950 --> 03:04:45,552
TALIESIN: And that's 16 points of damage plus
three psychic, so that's 19 points of damage. And

2899
03:04:45,552 --> 03:04:49,754
he has to do a constitution saving throw.

2900
03:04:49,754 --> 03:04:51,393
MATT: 26.

2901
03:04:51,393 --> 03:04:52,765
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it. Stop it.

2902
03:04:52,765 --> 03:04:55,375
MATT: I'm sorry. I'm rolling really well for their
saving throws.

2903
03:04:55,375 --> 03:05:02,927
TALIESIN: That's really irritating. I wasted so
much grit, and nothing's happened. All right, I'm

2904
03:05:02,927 --> 03:05:05,935
going to back up even further out of the room. I'm
going to back up to the very edge.

2905
03:05:05,935 --> 03:05:12,196
MATT: All right. So we'll say you back up over
there. You're now backing down into the tunnel

2906
03:05:12,196 --> 03:05:14,483
where you guys had risen up before you got to the
door.

2907
03:05:14,483 --> 03:05:18,823
LIAM and LAURA: T-pose, please.

2908
03:05:18,823 --> 03:05:23,325
MATT: All right, that ends Percival's turn. Vex,
you're up.

2909
03:05:23,325 --> 03:05:24,987
TALIESIN: We need some fire.

2910
03:05:24,987 --> 03:05:30,494
LAURA: Yeah, I don't have any of that. Well, but
my Blazing Bowstring. I'm going to try it.

2911
03:05:30,494 --> 03:05:33,049
TRAVIS: Maybe something else, like poison or acid?
Isn't it acid?

2912
03:05:33,049 --> 03:05:38,605
LAURA: I'm going to shoot the one that I tried to
hit before.

2913
03:05:38,605 --> 03:05:40,406
MATT: Okay. Want to leave Hunter's Mark on it,
still?

2914
03:05:40,406 --> 03:05:44,993
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to do it. I'm going to try
sharpshooter again.

2915
03:05:44,993 --> 03:05:46,306
MATT: Okay.

2916
03:05:46,306 --> 03:05:52,296
LAURA: Goddamn it. That doesn't hit. (sighs) Okay,
I'm going to try it again.

2917
03:05:52,296 --> 03:05:53,466
MATT: So was it a three?

2918
03:05:53,466 --> 03:05:54,633
LAURA: Yeah.

2919
03:05:54,633 --> 03:05:55,919
MATT: Plus?

2920
03:05:55,919 --> 03:05:57,520
LAURA: Plus 14, minus five.

2921
03:05:57,520 --> 03:05:58,640
MATT: Yeah, no.

2922
03:05:58,640 --> 03:06:02,867
LAURA: That one hits! That definitely hits.

2923
03:06:02,867 --> 03:06:04,267
LIAM: It's on foam, but it's good.

2924
03:06:04,267 --> 03:06:07,969
LAURA: That is, yeah. So that hits, right?

2925
03:06:07,969 --> 03:06:09,048
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

2926
03:06:09,048 --> 03:06:21,924
LAURA: Okay. I didn't say Blazing Bowstring, so it
doesn't count. 14 plus one lightning damage. Yeah,

2927
03:06:21,924 --> 03:06:23,574
sneak attack.

2928
03:06:23,574 --> 03:06:25,563
MARISHA: Hey, Grog.

2929
03:06:25,563 --> 03:06:26,292
TRAVIS: What?

2930
03:06:26,292 --> 03:06:27,531
MARISHA: You're good on health, yeah?

2931
03:06:27,531 --> 03:06:28,751
TRAVIS: (scoffs) Yeah.

2932
03:06:28,751 --> 03:06:36,350
LAURA: Plus six is 14 for the sneak attack. and
then five for Hunter's Mark.

2933
03:06:36,350 --> 03:06:38,539
MATT: Okay. And Blazing Bowstring?

2934
03:06:38,539 --> 03:06:40,714
LAURA: I didn't say Blazing Bowstring.

2935
03:06:40,714 --> 03:06:46,954
MATT: Oh, yeah. Okay. So the arrow (impact) hits
it in the chest area. You watch as part of its

2936
03:06:46,954 --> 03:06:52,332
ribcage caves in from the blow, and it actually
exits out the back. None of the flesh seems to stop

2937
03:06:52,332 --> 03:06:56,604
it, and it (choking) falls to the ground,
unmoving.

2938
03:06:56,604 --> 03:07:03,358
LAURA: For my bonus-- oh wait, that's a 4th-level
spell. Should I use it or not?

2939
03:07:03,358 --> 03:07:04,537
MARISHA: Save it.

2940
03:07:04,537 --> 03:07:09,144
LAURA: All right, I'll save it. I'm going to
transfer the Hunter's Mark to the one

2941
03:07:09,144 --> 03:07:10,723
attacking my brother.

2942
03:07:10,723 --> 03:07:12,637
MATT: As your bonus action? All right.

2943
03:07:12,637 --> 03:07:25,457
LAURA: And then Trinket is going to run up and
stand next to my brother so you can get flank attack.

2944
03:07:25,457 --> 03:07:27,025
LIAM: Love you.

2945
03:07:27,025 --> 03:07:29,837
MATT: There you go. Perfect. That ends Vex's turn.
Pike's up.

2946
03:07:29,837 --> 03:07:33,462
LIAM: Oh jeez. Okay. So I think--

2947
03:07:33,462 --> 03:07:35,278
TRAVIS: (singing) Fire!

2948
03:07:35,278 --> 03:07:37,885
LAURA: Should she do turn undead?

2949
03:07:37,885 --> 03:07:42,432
LIAM: She could turn undead, but how far are they?
They're probably too far apart. Well, no, she

2950
03:07:42,432 --> 03:07:43,963
could stand between them and do it.

2951
03:07:43,963 --> 03:07:45,783
LAURA: Each undead she can see within 30 feet.

2952
03:07:45,783 --> 03:07:49,728
LIAM: 30 feet. So she stands between. She's going
to climb up on-- no, I'm not going to say that.

2953
03:07:49,728 --> 03:07:57,499
She's going to take a step diagonally down this
way and then turnt undead.

2954
03:07:57,499 --> 03:08:01,309
MATT: Turnt undead? That's a whole different
ability.

2955
03:08:01,309 --> 03:08:08,522
LIAM: Wisdom saving throw. Spell save is 18. If
they're challenge rating four or lower, they're

2956
03:08:08,522 --> 03:08:09,676
blowed up.

2957
03:08:09,676 --> 03:08:12,717
MATT: They are not challenge rating four or lower.
It's a wisdom save?

2958
03:08:12,717 --> 03:08:16,692
LIAM: Yeah, wisdom save, and that just means
they're scared.

2959
03:08:16,692 --> 03:08:19,020
MATT: Yeah, they all fail.

2960
03:08:19,020 --> 03:08:21,186
LAURA: Yeah! They're scared of her!

2961
03:08:21,186 --> 03:08:28,090
MATT: As she holds up her holy symbol, you watch
as this radiant glow in the shape of Sarenrae

2962
03:08:28,090 --> 03:08:33,125
emits from behind her. These giant golden wings
emerge, and for a moment, you can see the

2963
03:08:33,125 --> 03:08:40,388
beautiful dark complexion and flaming hair rise
behind Pike. As that scatters outward, you watch

2964
03:08:40,388 --> 03:08:45,295
as the faces of these undead troll creatures all
of a sudden shift into this look of absolute

2965
03:08:45,295 --> 03:08:48,639
horror, and they all go (guttural groan) and begin
to make their way to turn and run.

2966
03:08:48,639 --> 03:08:50,204
TRAVIS: Turn and run?

2967
03:08:50,204 --> 03:08:51,637
LAURA: Yeah, they have to move away.

2968
03:08:51,637 --> 03:08:58,741
LIAM: Move as far away as you can from the person.
Also cannot take reactions. For its action, it can

2969
03:08:58,741 --> 03:09:02,489
use only the dash action. All they can do is run.

2970
03:09:02,489 --> 03:09:04,645
LAURA: If it's got nowhere to move, it can use
dodge.

2971
03:09:04,645 --> 03:09:07,085
TRAVIS: (singing) A do ron-ron-ron, a do ron-ron.

2972
03:09:07,085 --> 03:09:08,667
MATT: Exactly. How long does that last?

2973
03:09:08,667 --> 03:09:17,889
LAURA: It doesn't say, does it? One minute, or
until it takes any damage.

2974
03:09:17,889 --> 03:09:24,320
MATT: Right. Okay. So that ends Pike's turn. Okay.
Grog, you're up.

2975
03:09:24,320 --> 03:09:39,688
TRAVIS: Fe fi fo fuck it! Can I run over here?
(counting) And I'm going to smashy pants the

2976
03:09:39,688 --> 03:09:43,457
troll. Reckless, Great Weapon Master.

2977
03:09:43,457 --> 03:09:46,634
MATT: All right, go for it.

2978
03:09:46,634 --> 03:09:52,865
TRAVIS: Natural 20. That's the third one today!
That's a d10, though. Right, d10?

2979
03:09:52,865 --> 03:09:54,303
MATT: d10, yeah.

2980
03:09:54,303 --> 03:10:07,991
TRAVIS: (counting) 63.

2981
03:10:07,991 --> 03:10:16,576
MATT: (laughing) Oh shit. As you rush up behind,
as it's turning to run away from Pike, (snarl) it

2982
03:10:16,576 --> 03:10:22,721
turns around and its face comes right up to yours
as you go (whack). Its jaw rockets off and

2983
03:10:22,721 --> 03:10:24,626
scatters across the ground.

2984
03:10:24,626 --> 03:10:26,676
LAURA: Nice. At least it can't do a bite attack
any more.

2985
03:10:26,676 --> 03:10:27,957
MATT: You think that.

2986
03:10:27,957 --> 03:10:29,731
TRAVIS: You think that. It's got upper teeth.

2987
03:10:29,731 --> 03:10:34,204
MATT: Yeah. It's more of a jagged headbutt. So
that's your first attack.

2988
03:10:34,204 --> 03:10:42,462
TRAVIS: Same thing. 19.

2989
03:10:42,462 --> 03:10:44,458
MATT: A natural what?

2990
03:10:44,458 --> 03:10:54,836
TRAVIS: A natural-- shit, what was it? So it was
a-- shit, I can't do reverse math.

2991
03:10:54,836 --> 03:10:57,026
SAM: You mean subtraction.

2992
03:10:57,026 --> 03:11:16,577
(laughter)

2993
03:11:16,577 --> 03:11:22,510
TALIESIN: Oh man. What the hell?

2994
03:11:22,510 --> 03:11:25,484
TRAVIS: (laughing) Oh no! That hurt my brain. It
was an eight. Thank you.

2995
03:11:25,484 --> 03:11:27,494
MATT: All right. Does 19 hit your armor class?

2996
03:11:27,494 --> 03:11:28,501
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2997
03:11:28,501 --> 03:11:30,040
MATT: Roll damage.

2998
03:11:30,040 --> 03:11:44,819
TRAVIS: This guy has got up and down. Oh, no, now
I can't do math at all. 24. 34.

2999
03:11:44,819 --> 03:11:46,975
MATT: You suffer 34 points of bludgeoning damage.

3000
03:11:46,975 --> 03:11:50,455
TRAVIS: Nice. So 17.

3001
03:11:50,455 --> 03:11:52,515
LIAM: So he didn't strike the troll at all?

3002
03:11:52,515 --> 03:11:58,453
MATT: No. You knock the jaw off, and as you swing
back with a backwards strike, the arm seems to

3003
03:11:58,453 --> 03:12:03,203
swing around in a circle, and then clobber you in
the back of the head and you're like (grunts). You

3004
03:12:03,203 --> 03:12:06,264
spit blood on the ground, and you feel the ringing
in the back of your skull.

3005
03:12:06,264 --> 03:12:10,456
LAURA: What the fuck is this stupid-ass hammer?

3006
03:12:10,456 --> 03:12:11,918
TALIESIN: He's so excited.

3007
03:12:11,918 --> 03:12:15,202
MATT: You guys look over and watch as Grog
bludgeons himself in the back of the head.

3008
03:12:15,202 --> 03:12:18,964
MARISHA: I didn't know you were so flexible,
Grog.

3009
03:12:18,964 --> 03:12:20,318
LAURA: Are you drunk?

3010
03:12:20,318 --> 03:12:21,831
TRAVIS: A little, yep.

3011
03:12:21,831 --> 03:12:26,066
MATT: Ending Grog's turn. Vax, you're up. That
guy's no longer frightened, by the way, because

3012
03:12:26,066 --> 03:12:27,311
you did do damage to it.

3013
03:12:27,311 --> 03:12:30,610
TRAVIS: As my bonus action-- I do have a bonus
action-- can I use my second wind?

3014
03:12:30,610 --> 03:12:31,877
MATT: You may.

3015
03:12:31,877 --> 03:12:39,665
TRAVIS: Thank you. 1d10. (counting) 11 points.

3016
03:12:39,665 --> 03:12:42,655
MATT: There you go. What are you doing, Vax?

3017
03:12:42,655 --> 03:12:48,509
LIAM: What I'm going to do is turn to Trinket
really quick and say, guard this dead thing, and

3018
03:12:48,509 --> 03:12:56,228
then I'm going to use my movement and dash action,
if necessary, to sprint around and flank that

3019
03:12:56,228 --> 03:12:58,373
troll between me and Grog.

3020
03:12:58,373 --> 03:13:02,412
MATT: All right. Because it is frightened, and
it's within view of Pike, it does not make an

3021
03:13:02,412 --> 03:13:06,767
attack of opportunity on you. It doesn't even
notice you. You step over and rush this way, and

3022
03:13:06,767 --> 03:13:08,667
you are now there flanking it with Keyleth.

3023
03:13:08,667 --> 03:13:09,950
LIAM: Flanking with Keyleth? Okay.

3024
03:13:09,950 --> 03:13:12,772
MATT: You could do Scanlan if you wanted to move
there.

3025
03:13:12,772 --> 03:13:18,276
LIAM: If Keyleth is on the other side-- as long as
I'm flanking, either way.

3026
03:13:18,276 --> 03:13:20,463
MATT: So do you want to go the other way, against
Grog?

3027
03:13:20,463 --> 03:13:24,168
LIAM: No, I'm fine. I'm flanking with Keyleth
right now? To the butt.

3028
03:13:24,168 --> 03:13:26,471
MARISHA: I might drop a Fireball on your ass.

3029
03:13:26,471 --> 03:13:36,030
LIAM: That's fine. 28 on the first. And ooh,
30-something on the second.

3030
03:13:36,030 --> 03:13:37,563
MATT: Yeah, they both hit.

3031
03:13:37,563 --> 03:13:53,761
LIAM: Okay, so first one is (counting) 11 plus
psychic is 12, plus those guys. (counting) 28 for

3032
03:13:53,761 --> 03:13:55,462
that one. Sorry.

3033
03:13:55,462 --> 03:14:04,513
MATT: 28 points of damage? Hold on. Yeah, it falls
to the ground, unmoving (gurgle) as you stab it in

3034
03:14:04,513 --> 03:14:09,612
the back of the skull. You guys watch as the
dagger, as Whisper (splat) protrudes from the

3035
03:14:09,612 --> 03:14:12,817
front of the skull and it (gurgle, splat) and
slumps to the ground.

3036
03:14:12,817 --> 03:14:19,164
LIAM: That was the first one. The second one I'm
going to shove it down into its eye socket and

3037
03:14:19,164 --> 03:14:21,863
just grind it around for the second attack, even
though it's down.

3038
03:14:21,863 --> 03:14:24,038
MATT: Okay, so it's on the ground. It's easy
enough. You go ahead and grab the back of its

3039
03:14:24,038 --> 03:14:29,371
motionless skull, jam in, dig around and scramble
the brains on the inside with your dagger. Okay.

3040
03:14:29,371 --> 03:14:31,240
LIAM: That's it. Done.

3041
03:14:31,240 --> 03:14:39,839
MATT: Ending Vax's turn. The corpse on the ground,
as you're scrambling its brains, suddenly its

3042
03:14:39,839 --> 03:14:45,890
other eye flickers open. It reaches up and grabs
you, and from the ground, it's going to use you to

3043
03:14:45,890 --> 03:14:47,375
pull itself back up.

3044
03:14:47,375 --> 03:14:49,891
LAURA: We've got to chop it up or set it on fire.

3045
03:14:49,891 --> 03:14:58,815
MATT: At this point, it's going to take a claw
attack at you. That is a 20.

3046
03:14:58,815 --> 03:15:00,064
LIAM: Nope.

3047
03:15:00,064 --> 03:15:05,469
MATT: As it tries to claw at you, you barely dodge
out of the way. Your hair (whoosh) as it passes.

3048
03:15:05,469 --> 03:15:11,961
It's going to spin around and claw at Scanlan
behind with a 17?

3049
03:15:11,961 --> 03:15:13,528
SAM: Yeah, of course.

3050
03:15:13,528 --> 03:15:22,300
MATT: Nine points of slashing damage. And after it
finds purchase on you, it realizes that you're a

3051
03:15:22,300 --> 03:15:26,814
little more vulnerable. Its claws still dug in
your shoulder, it's going to pull you in and it's

3052
03:15:26,814 --> 03:15:32,129
going to attempt to, using its upper jaw, jam its
teeth down into you; the lower jaw with the tongue

3053
03:15:32,129 --> 03:15:41,502
is dangling out at this point. That is 25.

3054
03:15:41,502 --> 03:15:42,919
SAM: Yeah.

3055
03:15:42,919 --> 03:15:47,109
MATT: You take five points of piercing damage and
make a constitution saving throw.

3056
03:15:47,109 --> 03:15:49,285
LAURA: What does that mean?

3057
03:15:49,285 --> 03:15:51,911
LIAM: I did a constitution save 20 minutes ago.

3058
03:15:51,911 --> 03:15:53,537
LAURA: I know. I don't know what it means!

3059
03:15:53,537 --> 03:15:55,728
SAM: That's pretty good. 23.

3060
03:15:55,728 --> 03:16:06,408
MATT: Okay. All righty. This one's going to get
back up from the ground, it's going to crawl its

3061
03:16:06,408 --> 03:16:10,674
way back to its feet and it's going to unload on
Pike again, as she's right there.

3062
03:16:10,674 --> 03:16:12,529
TALIESIN: It hasn't been hit yet since she--

3063
03:16:12,529 --> 03:16:20,127
MATT: It was dead when she did turn undead; it was
not affected by it. But it has since regenerated

3064
03:16:20,127 --> 03:16:21,448
itself back.

3065
03:16:21,448 --> 03:16:25,243
LIAM: Was it dead or was it undead? I'm just being
stupid; go for it.

3066
03:16:25,243 --> 03:16:29,767
MATT: No worries. Yeah, unfortunately, its body
was not moving; it was not actively present and

3067
03:16:29,767 --> 03:16:36,406
able to pay attention when the first effect
happened. That's four plus 11, that's not a hit.

3068
03:16:36,406 --> 03:16:43,483
That's 15. That's a 14. Then with its bite attack
that is a 22. What's her armor class?

3069
03:16:43,483 --> 03:16:44,837
LAURA: 23.

3070
03:16:44,837 --> 03:16:49,727
MATT: 23 with the shield, yeah. It goes to bite
towards her, its jaw tearing open, the muscle

3071
03:16:49,727 --> 03:16:54,952
actually stretching and pulling with each bite as
its body's falling apart, and she beats it back

3072
03:16:54,952 --> 03:17:01,100
with her armor and shield. No effect. And this one
here, which has not been damaged, is going to go

3073
03:17:01,100 --> 03:17:08,461
ahead and run the fuck away. You guys don't even
see where it is right now. All right. That brings

3074
03:17:08,461 --> 03:17:10,052
us to Scanlan's turn.

3075
03:17:10,052 --> 03:17:19,992
SAM: All right. Jesus. There's all these people
around. All right, I'm going to step away from the

3076
03:17:19,992 --> 03:17:25,226
troll, and I'm going to light it up.

3077
03:17:25,226 --> 03:17:26,950
MATT: Okay. As you step back, it's going to go
ahead and make--

3078
03:17:26,950 --> 03:17:28,223
SAM: I thought it was frightened!

3079
03:17:28,223 --> 03:17:35,805
MATT: No, it was until he hit it. It's going to
try and swing its bite at you once more.

3080
03:17:35,805 --> 03:17:38,465
That is a 15.

3081
03:17:38,465 --> 03:17:39,775
SAM: Yeah.

3082
03:17:39,775 --> 03:17:42,011
LAURA: Jeez, Scanlan! You need better armor!

3083
03:17:42,011 --> 03:17:44,471
MARISHA: Matt! Did you skip me?

3084
03:17:44,471 --> 03:17:46,858
MATT: No, you were last; you're after Scanlan.

3085
03:17:46,858 --> 03:17:49,583
TRAVIS: Yeah, remember you rolled shit?

3086
03:17:49,583 --> 03:17:52,372
MARISHA: No, I know. Yeah, no, I remember that.

3087
03:17:52,372 --> 03:17:54,456
MATT: Or did I skip you last turn, you mean?

3088
03:17:54,456 --> 03:17:58,063
MARISHA: This is the second time he's going,
right?

3089
03:17:58,063 --> 03:17:59,951
MATT: Correct. Oh, I must have skipped you last
turn! I'm so sorry!

3090
03:17:59,951 --> 03:18:03,983
MARISHA: It's okay. I don't think I've done
anything yet. I've only dodged.

3091
03:18:03,983 --> 03:18:08,075
MATT: No, I'll give you two rounds after this.
It's my fault. That's totally my fault.

3092
03:18:08,075 --> 03:18:09,288
I'm sorry.

3093
03:18:09,288 --> 03:18:10,476
MARISHA: That's okay.

3094
03:18:10,476 --> 03:18:17,038
MATT: So anyway, that's six points of piercing
damage to you. Make a constitution saving throw.

3095
03:18:17,038 --> 03:18:18,914
SAM: Ooh, natural 20.

3096
03:18:18,914 --> 03:18:23,079
MATT: All right. Keyleth. What are you doing,
twice, because it's my fault?

3097
03:18:23,079 --> 03:18:24,832
SAM: It's still my turn.

3098
03:18:24,832 --> 03:18:25,972
MATT: Oh, that's right, sorry.

3099
03:18:25,972 --> 03:18:29,247
SAM: Fireball! Wand of Fireball.

3100
03:18:29,247 --> 03:18:30,871
MATT: To who?

3101
03:18:30,871 --> 03:18:34,673
SAM: To that troll who just hit me. I was backing
away.

3102
03:18:34,673 --> 03:18:37,240
LAURA: You're going to smoke everybody?

3103
03:18:37,240 --> 03:18:38,949
SAM: I asked!

3104
03:18:38,949 --> 03:18:40,322
LIAM: I'll be fine.

3105
03:18:40,322 --> 03:18:45,828
MARISHA: You can place it to where it might hit
both of them and not us.

3106
03:18:45,828 --> 03:18:47,694
SAM: Is it that big?

3107
03:18:47,694 --> 03:18:49,514
LIAM: Yeah, dude.

3108
03:18:49,514 --> 03:18:52,233
SAM: Oh shit! Well, then yeah, I'm smoking them
both.

3109
03:18:52,233 --> 03:18:58,718
MATT: All right. In order to do that, you're going
to hit Pike, Vax, and Grog.

3110
03:18:58,718 --> 03:19:00,312
SAM: Sorry, friends!

3111
03:19:00,312 --> 03:19:01,766
MATT: That's okay. Pike has fire resistance.

3112
03:19:01,766 --> 03:19:03,790
TRAVIS: You don't have to hit me!

3113
03:19:03,790 --> 03:19:09,301
MATT: I need Grog, Vax and Pike to make dexterity
saving throws.

3114
03:19:09,301 --> 03:19:11,634
LAURA: Is it possible to do it without hitting
Grog?

3115
03:19:11,634 --> 03:19:19,973
MATT: No. Not at that size. He probably could, but
it'll hit Trinket. Your choice.

3116
03:19:19,973 --> 03:19:21,998
LAURA: It's Scanlan's choice.

3117
03:19:21,998 --> 03:19:25,264
MATT: Scanlan, Grog or Trinket? You're going to
hit one or the other.

3118
03:19:25,264 --> 03:19:29,858
SAM: Absolutely Grog. I love my Trinket.

3119
03:19:29,858 --> 03:19:32,326
TRAVIS: But he just goes back into the necklace.

3120
03:19:32,326 --> 03:19:36,544
SAM: All right, you're right. Then I'll hit
Trinket.

3121
03:19:36,544 --> 03:19:39,307
LAURA: You're a dick.

3122
03:19:39,307 --> 03:19:42,116
MATT: All right. Roll a dexterity save for
Trinket.

3123
03:19:42,116 --> 03:19:43,723
LAURA: Oh, motherfuck!

3124
03:19:43,723 --> 03:19:46,838
LIAM: I already rolled terribly for Pike.

3125
03:19:46,838 --> 03:19:54,178
SAM: It's a wand, so I'm using three charges. It's
10d6.

3126
03:19:54,178 --> 03:19:57,586
MATT: Oh! Right! All right. So 10d6 points of fire
damage.

3127
03:19:57,586 --> 03:19:59,069
LAURA: 11.

3128
03:19:59,069 --> 03:20:02,741
SAM: I have zero d6 right now. I don't what
happened to mine.

3129
03:20:02,741 --> 03:20:06,682
LIAM: Pike got a five. Vax got a 20.

3130
03:20:06,682 --> 03:20:13,050
MATT: Okay, and your spell, what's the DC on the
wand? 15? So yeah, you succeed. You take no

3131
03:20:13,050 --> 03:20:14,988
damage, being a rogue.

3132
03:20:14,988 --> 03:20:16,227
LIAM: Lovely.

3133
03:20:16,227 --> 03:20:37,607
MATT: That's a good roll.

3134
03:20:37,607 --> 03:20:39,023
SAM: 40.

3135
03:20:39,023 --> 03:20:43,405
MATT: So 40 points of fire damage. 20 to Pike,
because she's resistant. None to that. 40 to

3136
03:20:43,405 --> 03:21:02,533
Trinket. You watch as both of the standing trolls
scatter to ash. They turn to burned dust and

3137
03:21:02,533 --> 03:21:08,418
nothing as their bodies are consumed by the flame
of the Fireball, leaving nothing but smoke and a

3138
03:21:08,418 --> 03:21:13,947
shadow of their form against the wall. All right,
Scanlan. That ends your turn?

3139
03:21:13,947 --> 03:21:20,646
SAM: Yeah, and to refresh, that's a wand. Does
that still use my spell slot?

3140
03:21:20,646 --> 03:21:22,828
MATT: No, the wand has charges on it.

3141
03:21:22,828 --> 03:21:26,728
LAURA: Can you use that wand again?

3142
03:21:26,728 --> 03:21:30,768
SAM: Yeah, it regenerates after a long rest. I
have to roll for it.

3143
03:21:30,768 --> 03:21:33,333
LIAM: But it's not a one-shot; it's got several
charges, right?

3144
03:21:33,333 --> 03:21:35,530
SAM: It's got several charges. It's got more in
it.

3145
03:21:35,530 --> 03:21:38,279
MATT: Did you write down how many charges it has?

3146
03:21:38,279 --> 03:21:43,223
TALIESIN: Vax, do you want to check for traps and
see if there's anything interesting in there?

3147
03:21:43,223 --> 03:21:49,126
MATT: Keyleth, what do you want to do? There's
still one troll over here that ran out of sight.

3148
03:21:49,126 --> 03:21:52,099
MARISHA: He ran out of sight?

3149
03:21:52,099 --> 03:21:55,606
SAM: Well, let's go plunder the loot.

3150
03:21:55,606 --> 03:22:01,075
MARISHA: You guys go plunder the loot. I'll creep
over.

3151
03:22:01,075 --> 03:22:05,826
MATT: I'm sorry about missing your turn. I feel so
bad about it.

3152
03:22:05,826 --> 03:22:07,839
MARISHA: That's okay! You're so cute.

3153
03:22:07,839 --> 03:22:11,009
MATT: So you're going where?

3154
03:22:11,009 --> 03:22:12,855
MARISHA: I want to see if I can see him.

3155
03:22:12,855 --> 03:22:16,266
MATT: Six, and you're going to dash with your
action to move over?

3156
03:22:16,266 --> 03:22:17,708
MARISHA: Can I not see him?

3157
03:22:17,708 --> 03:22:26,228
MATT: Not with your basic movement, no. There's a
wall. Okay, so you move around the corner and you

3158
03:22:26,228 --> 03:22:31,631
watch as the troll is currently locked in the
corner with its back to the wall, going,

3159
03:22:31,631 --> 03:22:34,510
(monster noises).

3160
03:22:34,510 --> 03:22:41,672
MARISHA: I go, hey it's okay, calm-- Fireball! Out
of the staff.

3161
03:22:41,672 --> 03:22:43,151
MATT: Okay.

3162
03:22:43,151 --> 03:22:49,061
TRAVIS: Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!

3163
03:22:49,061 --> 03:22:58,957
MATT: Yeah, no, that won't hit anything but
himself and the surrounding chamber. Go ahead and

3164
03:22:58,957 --> 03:23:00,407
roll damage on that.

3165
03:23:00,407 --> 03:23:04,261
MARISHA: (counting) Can I get two more d6s from
you?

3166
03:23:04,261 --> 03:23:06,227
MATT: You're doing a standard 8d6?

3167
03:23:06,227 --> 03:23:19,175
MARISHA: It's out of my staff. I can't do any
more, right? Reroll, yep. (singing) Like a d6,

3168
03:23:19,175 --> 03:23:35,381
like a like a d6! (counting) 35 damage.

3169
03:23:35,381 --> 03:23:42,520
MATT: 35 damage. All righty. (explosion) The
explosion hits and bursts around. The flames burn,

3170
03:23:42,520 --> 03:23:47,829
and you can see some flames are catching on the
troll. (monster noises). Still alive.

3171
03:23:47,829 --> 03:23:54,354
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to take my bonus action
to do something I've never done before. I'm going

3172
03:23:54,354 --> 03:23:59,726
to trace, from my staff, and pull out a flame
blade. (shing)

3173
03:23:59,726 --> 03:24:05,475
MATT: Okay! So you guys watch as Keyleth puts her
fingers across the top of the staff. Where her

3174
03:24:05,475 --> 03:24:11,814
fingers arc around, it creates this arc of fire,
and when she stops she grabs on to a hilt that

3175
03:24:11,814 --> 03:24:16,940
didn't exist, but now does, in her hand. That arc
of flame that stayed suddenly solidifies into a

3176
03:24:16,940 --> 03:24:18,570
scimitar-like blade that's in her hand.

3177
03:24:18,570 --> 03:24:21,357
LAURA: You can do that?!

3178
03:24:21,357 --> 03:24:23,077
LIAM: She's a fucking Jedi!

3179
03:24:23,077 --> 03:24:26,215
MATT: All right, that ends your turn? All right,
Percy.

3180
03:24:26,215 --> 03:24:30,192
LAURA: You didn't even see it!

3181
03:24:30,192 --> 03:24:39,508
LIAM: I can imagine it in the abstract universe,
though. I sure can, Laura Bailey! I sure can!

3182
03:24:39,508 --> 03:24:44,749
SAM: Well, look who's back in the fight.

3183
03:24:44,749 --> 03:24:49,801
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's all. Ain't nothing else
happening. Just taking a look. Yeah, she's got this.

3184
03:24:49,801 --> 03:24:56,748
MATT: All right, ends Percival's turn. Vex, you're
up.

3185
03:24:56,748 --> 03:25:07,516
LAURA: No, I'm going to fly over. Can I get to a
place where I can see the troll? Well, how many is this?

3186
03:25:07,516 --> 03:25:09,252
MATT: Are you going to fly down?

3187
03:25:09,252 --> 03:25:12,448
LAURA: I have 50 feet on my broom.

3188
03:25:12,448 --> 03:25:15,610
LIAM: You could dash. Broom dash.

3189
03:25:15,610 --> 03:25:17,330
MATT: You'd get right around there and see it.

3190
03:25:17,330 --> 03:25:20,945
LAURA: I'm going to shoot him! And he's still
Hunter's Marked!

3191
03:25:20,945 --> 03:25:22,346
MATT: He is, yes.

3192
03:25:22,346 --> 03:25:26,492
LAURA: 17?

3193
03:25:26,492 --> 03:25:28,896
MATT: 17 does hit.

3194
03:25:28,896 --> 03:25:43,111
LAURA: Oh, thank god. I didn't say it; it didn't
happen. 13 plus three lightning damage. Plus one

3195
03:25:43,111 --> 03:25:44,574
Hunter's Mark.

3196
03:25:44,574 --> 03:25:50,065
MATT: The first strike hits it. It still has the
fire trailing up its body. Second shot?

3197
03:25:50,065 --> 03:25:53,217
LAURA: 21.

3198
03:25:53,217 --> 03:25:54,088
MATT: That hits.

3199
03:25:54,088 --> 03:25:56,243
SAM: Say the thing that you wanted to say.

3200
03:25:56,243 --> 03:26:06,210
LAURA: The Blazing Bowstring? Blazing Bowstring.
Sorry. I only get two per short rest, so if we

3201
03:26:06,210 --> 03:26:18,149
don't rest, then I don't get it again! Six
lightning damage, plus nine, plus two. 11.

3202
03:26:18,149 --> 03:26:26,681
MATT: Both arrows hit it in the chest. One, two!
It's still standing there, the flames curling

3203
03:26:26,681 --> 03:26:29,456
around it. The ceiling, by the way, from the
impact of the Fireball,

3204
03:26:29,456 --> 03:26:35,080
is looking pretty fragile.

3205
03:26:35,080 --> 03:26:38,280
LAURA: But that's the exit. That's where we need
to go to?

3206
03:26:38,280 --> 03:26:43,834
MATT: You do see, Keyleth, from this perspective,
there's a small opening on the far wall where it

3207
03:26:43,834 --> 03:26:47,611
looks like possibly whoever raided this vault had
previously tunneled into it.

3208
03:26:47,611 --> 03:26:52,037
LAURA: Shit! Would Trinket have been able to make
it over to him?

3209
03:26:52,037 --> 03:27:04,348
MATT: It would've been really close. Probably not.
You don't know. It's possible. End of your turn,

3210
03:27:04,348 --> 03:27:06,112
Vex? Pike's up.

3211
03:27:06,112 --> 03:27:19,350
LIAM: Pike saw Keyleth go running down that way,
so she is going to run after her. (counting) She

3212
03:27:19,350 --> 03:27:21,421
can't see the troll from there, right?

3213
03:27:21,421 --> 03:27:23,521
MATT: She can see the troll just past the corner,
there.

3214
03:27:23,521 --> 03:27:26,233
LIAM: She can see the troll? Oh my god, I think
it's time for a Guiding Bolt!

3215
03:27:26,233 --> 03:27:28,155
LAURA: (singing) Guiding Bolt up the butt!

3216
03:27:28,155 --> 03:27:33,534
MATT: That's our next T-shirt. Guiding Bolt up the
butt!

3217
03:27:33,534 --> 03:27:39,829
LIAM: Range 120 feet. A flash of light streaks
toward a creature of your choice within range.

3218
03:27:39,829 --> 03:27:43,469
Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On
a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage and the

3219
03:27:43,469 --> 03:27:50,664
next attack roll-- okay. Yeah, make a spell ranged
attack plus ten, because it's Pike. Yeah, you've

3220
03:27:50,664 --> 03:27:59,615
got to attack. Yo, here's the white die you gave
me. 13 plus ten is 23.

3221
03:27:59,615 --> 03:28:01,776
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

3222
03:28:01,776 --> 03:28:05,639
TRAVIS: Extra damage because it's undead?

3223
03:28:05,639 --> 03:28:10,999
LAURA: I don't think so. 12. Guiding Bolt!

3224
03:28:10,999 --> 03:28:21,654
LIAM: Specifically toward the taint, Matt. Pike's
on a tear today.

3225
03:28:21,654 --> 03:28:27,361
MATT: All right, so. As she comes around the
corner, the holy symbol in one hand, clutching

3226
03:28:27,361 --> 03:28:32,557
behind the shield, she notches the edge of the 
mace at the edge of her belt and releases a bolt

3227
03:28:32,557 --> 03:28:44,190
of energy. How do you want to do this? Because the
radiant damage shuts down the undead fortitude,

3228
03:28:44,190 --> 03:28:47,995
and the fire knocks down the regeneration.

3229
03:28:47,995 --> 03:28:53,915
LIAM: The Guiding Bolt streaks through the air,
loops down to the ground, up through the butt, up

3230
03:28:53,915 --> 03:29:04,063
out the head, and out the mouth. Everyone vaguely
hears, "That's my Pike." And its head explodes.

3231
03:29:04,063 --> 03:29:09,652
MATT: You see the radiant energy bursting out of
its eyes, and as it screams, its head blasted

3232
03:29:09,652 --> 03:29:13,935
upward, the energy bursting through its mouth, the jaw
begins to burn away as the flames left over from

3233
03:29:13,935 --> 03:29:18,563
the Fireball consume the rest of its body. It
tumbles to its knees and burns into this skeletal

3234
03:29:18,563 --> 03:29:20,742
mass that turns to ash on the ground.

3235
03:29:20,742 --> 03:29:24,757
LIAM: That happened in six seconds. It was like,
(explosions).

3236
03:29:24,757 --> 03:29:27,593
LAURA: We need to get out of here. It's
crumbling.

3237
03:29:27,593 --> 03:29:29,032
TRAVIS: There are chests about.

3238
03:29:29,032 --> 03:29:35,481
MARISHA: I take my flaming sword and do a few Jedi
kid moves. When no one's looking, go

3239
03:29:35,481 --> 03:29:38,828
(lightsaber noises).

3240
03:29:38,828 --> 03:29:43,203
LAURA: I go check for traps on that chest right
there.

3241
03:29:43,203 --> 03:29:48,309
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3242
03:29:48,309 --> 03:29:54,530
LAURA: 14.

3243
03:29:54,530 --> 03:29:57,433
MATT: 14? Okay. Does not appear to be trapped.

3244
03:29:57,433 --> 03:29:59,232
LAURA: All right, then I'm going to open it.

3245
03:29:59,232 --> 03:30:04,997
MATT: You open it? There are seven gold pieces,
two silver, and the rest of it's empty.

3246
03:30:04,997 --> 03:30:09,708
LAURA: Awesome. Look at all this money!

3247
03:30:09,708 --> 03:30:13,036
TALIESIN: I'll check for traps.

3248
03:30:13,036 --> 03:30:15,361
MATT: Investigation check.

3249
03:30:15,361 --> 03:30:22,789
TALIESIN: It's a 22.

3250
03:30:22,789 --> 03:30:26,375
MATT: 22, okay. Room does not appear to be
trapped, from what you can see.

3251
03:30:26,375 --> 03:30:30,729
TALIESIN: I'm going to check that trunk. The
chest.

3252
03:30:30,729 --> 03:30:33,643
MATT: You're going to check that for traps, as
well?

3253
03:30:33,643 --> 03:30:38,235
TALIESIN: This is not quite as-- seven.

3254
03:30:38,235 --> 03:30:41,068
MATT: Make a perception check. Seven? Doesn't
appear to be trapped.

3255
03:30:41,068 --> 03:30:42,487
TALIESIN: I open it.

3256
03:30:42,487 --> 03:30:48,797
MATT: Opens. It's not locked. There's about 12
pieces of gold, two copper, a silver. This place

3257
03:30:48,797 --> 03:30:50,494
has been cleared out.

3258
03:30:50,494 --> 03:30:54,142
LAURA: I'm going to pick up that little pile of
gold, those couple pieces of gold

3259
03:30:54,142 --> 03:30:55,515
I see on the ground.

3260
03:30:55,515 --> 03:31:02,826
MATT: You gather what amounts to about 35 gold
pieces from there. Keyleth, what did you roll? 26?

3261
03:31:02,826 --> 03:31:08,142
You're watching as one of the supports that-- The
ceilings here are pretty solid. The one on the far

3262
03:31:08,142 --> 03:31:13,583
end here has sustained damage from the Fireball
and the drilling entry of whoever came in here

3263
03:31:13,583 --> 03:31:17,640
previously, and the constant moves of the titan.
At which point, you watch and you feel the

3264
03:31:17,640 --> 03:31:22,813
(rumbling), the most recent footfall of the titan.
The whole ceiling right there in the corner goes

3265
03:31:22,813 --> 03:31:28,939
(crashing). This entire chamber.

3266
03:31:28,939 --> 03:31:30,967
SAM: The door's covered!

3267
03:31:30,967 --> 03:31:34,275
LAURA: Can you get through it, Keyleth?

3268
03:31:34,275 --> 03:31:36,881
TRAVIS: Remember, there were three different ways,
though, and we took one.

3269
03:31:36,881 --> 03:31:39,578
SAM: That's the one we need, though.

3270
03:31:39,578 --> 03:31:47,536
LIAM: Okay, realizing that the druid and the
goliath are going to have to figure that out, Vax

3271
03:31:47,536 --> 03:31:52,517
walks to the middle there and starts to take a wee
in the corner. It's been a long time.

3272
03:31:52,517 --> 03:31:57,418
TRAVIS: Do we want to go through the collapsed
doorway, or do we want to go back to one of the

3273
03:31:57,418 --> 03:31:58,874
other tunnels?

3274
03:31:58,874 --> 03:32:03,572
LAURA: Whatever other tunnel options, there's
probably other monsters, trolls, fucking undead

3275
03:32:03,572 --> 03:32:04,840
waiting there, too.

3276
03:32:04,840 --> 03:32:14,435
SAM: This is on you, Grog. No, don't use any
spells. Don't use any spells. Grog, punch through

3277
03:32:14,435 --> 03:32:15,404
this shit.

3278
03:32:15,404 --> 03:32:23,877
MARISHA: Wait, I can Commune with Nature and maybe
figure out the tunnel system, or depending on

3279
03:32:23,877 --> 03:32:28,634
where we are and if we think we're on that time
crunch and we want to get going-- I didn't want to

3280
03:32:28,634 --> 03:32:34,174
burn this yet. I did bring Find the Path, which is
a one-day concentration spell which gets us to

3281
03:32:34,174 --> 03:32:43,160
where we want to go as quick as possible. But I
don't know. Can I do that with Thar Amphala?

3282
03:32:43,160 --> 03:32:46,334
SAM: Don't you need to know where you're going for
that spell to work?

3283
03:32:46,334 --> 03:32:48,797
MARISHA: Well, if we're getting to Thar Amphala.

3284
03:32:48,797 --> 03:32:50,945
SAM: It's a big city.

3285
03:32:50,945 --> 03:32:58,750
MATT: It's concentration for up to one day, but if
you lose concentration halfway through--

3286
03:32:58,750 --> 03:33:03,735
MARISHA: Which is why I haven't wanted to do it
yet, until we felt like we needed to go.

3287
03:33:03,735 --> 03:33:08,020
MATT: To a specific, fixed location you're
familiar with in the same plane of existence. So

3288
03:33:08,020 --> 03:33:13,513
you could, in theory, say, "Thar Amphala," and it
would guide you to the fastest path there until

3289
03:33:13,513 --> 03:33:15,140
you lost concentration.

3290
03:33:15,140 --> 03:33:24,351
MARISHA: I'm just saying, we have that at our
disposal when we feel. Do we want to do a quick

3291
03:33:24,351 --> 03:33:28,002
Commune with Nature, then, to try and get paths?
It's going to take a few minutes, though.

3292
03:33:28,002 --> 03:33:29,573
SAM: What would that tell you?

3293
03:33:29,573 --> 03:33:35,495
MARISHA: I could get an idea of the tunnel system
for a three-mile radius.

3294
03:33:35,495 --> 03:33:40,144
LIAM: Yeah, let her do her thing. I think we can
afford a few minutes. Then Grog could finish

3295
03:33:40,144 --> 03:33:43,620
attuning-- oh, you did. That "stop hitting
yourself" hammer was attuned.

3296
03:33:43,620 --> 03:33:47,557
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, have I finished attuning with the
black hammer of face-smash?

3297
03:33:47,557 --> 03:33:52,075
SAM: Is the hammer called the Stop Hitting
Yourself hammer?

3298
03:33:52,075 --> 03:33:57,252
MATT: Best you can make out with it, it is an
adamantine hammer, but there is something wrong

3299
03:33:57,252 --> 03:34:05,075
about its enchantment. There is something about it
that is locked into your soul at the moment. It's

3300
03:34:05,075 --> 03:34:10,784
occupying a portion of yourself.

3301
03:34:10,784 --> 03:34:14,383
LIAM: You are going to crit on Vecna and K.O.
yourself.

3302
03:34:14,383 --> 03:34:21,773
MATT: Pike, you guys have dealt with cursed items
before. This is a cursed item.

3303
03:34:21,773 --> 03:34:27,137
LIAM: Greater Restoration? I'm looking.

3304
03:34:27,137 --> 03:34:32,531
TRAVIS: Do I know it's cursed? It's a familiar
feeling? From Craven Edge?

3305
03:34:32,531 --> 03:34:38,486
MATT: Well, Craven wasn't cursed. Craven was
intelligent. This is something has sunk into you.

3306
03:34:38,486 --> 03:34:42,535
LAURA: She's going to try to Greater Restoration
Grog.

3307
03:34:42,535 --> 03:34:51,479
LIAM: She'll grab him by the cheeks and squish the
cheeks and say, "Grog, don't go touching things

3308
03:34:51,479 --> 03:34:54,179
"you don't know what they are!" Cast Greater
Restoration.

3309
03:34:54,179 --> 03:35:00,299
MATT: Okay, so mark off the Greater Restoration.
As you feel the hammer in your hand, it's like

3310
03:35:00,299 --> 03:35:05,087
your fingers won't let go of it. They're almost
clenched to it. The minute she touches you, you

3311
03:35:05,087 --> 03:35:10,435
feel this warmth pass through your body, through
your arms, to your hand. With that, your fingers

3312
03:35:10,435 --> 03:35:16,647
widen and the hammer falls to the ground, there.
That hold that it had on you is lifted.

3313
03:35:16,647 --> 03:35:19,510
TRAVIS: I think I'm going to leave this here, if
that's cool with you guys.

3314
03:35:19,510 --> 03:35:27,222
LIAM: She gives you the mom look and says, "Don't
touch it, okay?"

3315
03:35:27,222 --> 03:35:31,658
LAURA: Do you have time to attune to your other
thing?

3316
03:35:31,658 --> 03:35:35,134
TRAIVS: Yeah, I'll pick up the Bloodaxe out of
the Bag of Holding and start attuning to that

3317
03:35:35,194 --> 03:35:38,350
again. Old trusty Bloodaxe.

3318
03:35:38,350 --> 03:35:49,253
MATT: So you guys are taking a short rest to
attune? In caves and other natural underground

3319
03:35:49,253 --> 03:35:56,164
settings. Make a nature check. The radius is only
300 feet when you're underground.

3320
03:35:56,164 --> 03:36:03,672
MARISHA: Okay, 25.

3321
03:36:03,672 --> 03:36:09,843
MATT: 25. One, this is not a natural underground
location. The entirety of this area is the inside

3322
03:36:09,843 --> 03:36:14,973
of an ancient, powerful elemental entity. Also,
the spell doesn't function where nature has been

3323
03:36:14,973 --> 03:36:18,677
replaced by construction, such as dungeons and
towns, so for the most part, that spell would not

3324
03:36:18,677 --> 03:36:21,085
aid you. My apologies.

3325
03:36:21,085 --> 03:36:24,036
MARISHA: But you're not letting me cast it,
right?

3326
03:36:24,036 --> 03:36:28,254
MATT: I'm not letting you cast it. That nature
check was to see whether or not the surroundings

3327
03:36:28,254 --> 03:36:34,125
would help you, so you know not to waste that
spell. So as you take your short rest, you attune

3328
03:36:34,125 --> 03:36:38,198
to your proper weapon, and you begin to talk
amongst yourselves as to what the next proper path

3329
03:36:38,198 --> 03:36:45,636
or action to take is as you climb through the
crypts toward your destination, we're going to go

3330
03:36:45,636 --> 03:36:48,880
ahead and end tonight's session there. It's just
past 11.

3331
03:36:48,880 --> 03:36:51,045
TRAVIS: I've got to take a picture of this.

3332
03:36:51,045 --> 03:37:03,871
MATT: Great game, guys. Well done. We'll pick this
up in a couple weeks. This is an upward dungeon

3333
03:37:03,871 --> 03:37:05,497
crawl. This is fun.

3334
03:37:05,497 --> 03:37:12,428
TRAVIS: He must have fallen against a mountain in
an upright manner.

3335
03:37:12,428 --> 03:37:20,608
MATT: Oh, the titan? The titan was thrust into the
ground in a mountain range. The mountain range

3336
03:37:20,608 --> 03:37:25,769
rose up around it. Technically you wouldn't know
this, but it doesn't matter. Part of the battle

3337
03:37:25,769 --> 03:37:30,130
that smote the titan thrust it downward and
created the mountain range around it.

3338
03:37:30,130 --> 03:37:34,731
TRAVIS: That's amazing. Nice job, Matt!

3339
03:37:34,731 --> 03:37:38,806
MATT: Nice job, you guys! That was awesome.
We'll pick this up in a couple weeks. You guys

3340
03:37:38,806 --> 03:37:43,216
will return next week, where you'll get to see
this awesome man run his awesome game!

3341
03:37:43,216 --> 03:37:49,080
SAM: It's going to be awesome! It's all set in the
world of Alice in Wonderland.

3342
03:37:49,080 --> 03:37:50,482
LAURA: Is it?

3343
03:37:50,482 --> 03:37:51,506
SAM: No!

3344
03:37:51,506 --> 03:38:03,660
LIAM: Guys, have so much fucking fun on the playa.
Recharge, reset, energize, go nuts. Miss you.

3345
03:38:03,660 --> 03:38:05,193
MATT: We'll miss you too, guys.

3346
03:38:05,193 --> 03:38:10,700
SAM: Any Critters who are on the playa with these
guys, they will take off their clothes if you ask them.

3347
03:38:10,700 --> 03:38:16,938
LIAM: No! They need to recharge! Give them some
space, let them recharge!

3348
03:38:16,938 --> 03:38:21,877
MARISHA: If you see me topless, please don't take
a photo.

3349
03:38:21,877 --> 03:38:24,775
MATT: Why would you say that?!

3350
03:38:24,775 --> 03:38:33,939
MARISHA: It was a joke! It was a fucking joke that
the internet will take too seriously, I'm sure.

3351
03:38:33,939 --> 03:38:38,492
LIAM: I'll be topless on Sam's one-shot. You can
look at me instead.

3352
03:38:38,492 --> 03:38:42,320
MARISHA: If you see Liam topless, take all the
photos.

3353
03:38:42,320 --> 03:38:45,964
LIAM: Push-ups for seven days; here we go!

3354
03:38:45,964 --> 03:38:55,635
MATT: All right, guys. Well, we're going to take
off. Thank you so much for joining us tonight.

3355
03:38:55,635 --> 03:39:00,740
Rest well, and is it Thursday yet? Good night!

3356
03:39:00,740 --> 03:45:25,173
