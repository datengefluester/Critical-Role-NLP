1
00:00:00,175 --> 00:00:03,775
(giggling)

2
00:00:03,775 --> 00:00:15,611
TRAVIS: We're fucking doing this. Hello! Welcome
to this evening's episode of Critical Role. I will

3
00:00:15,611 --> 00:00:20,410
be your DM for the evening. My name is Travis
Willingham, and this is where a bunch of us

4
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,651
nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons & Dragons.

5
00:00:23,651 --> 00:00:26,433
TALIESIN: This feels sacrilege.

6
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:33,358
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. I'm going to soil this seat all
night long. Just soil it and make it mine.

7
00:00:33,358 --> 00:00:41,922
Welcome! Tonight you will be enjoying a game DM'ed
by my Critical Role character, Grog. Certainly not

8
00:00:41,922 --> 00:00:48,800
me. Any mistakes I make, I am not responsible for.
It is all Grog's fault. Tonight's episode is

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,402
brought to you by a wonderful sponsor, Marvel
Puzzle Quest! Sam!

10
00:00:52,402 --> 00:01:00,226
SAM: In honor of Marvel Puzzle Quest sponsoring
this episode, we actually had Grog write the

11
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,710
advertising copy.

12
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,277
TRAVIS: I remember that, yeah.

13
00:01:03,277 --> 00:01:10,581
SAM: It starts like this. I am Grog. I smash
things and people. Sometimes, I use a hammer, much

14
00:01:10,581 --> 00:01:17,062
like another big man named Thor! Thor is not a
goliath, but he is strong, almost as strong as

15
00:01:17,062 --> 00:01:24,323
Grog. I like Thor because his name is easy to say.
Thor is on a quest to a place called Marvel

16
00:01:24,323 --> 00:01:30,627
Puzzle. This Marvel Puzzle Quest must be magic,
because it happens only on telly-phones and

17
00:01:30,627 --> 00:01:37,858
inty-nets. You have to press buttons to rage.
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard! Inspired

18
00:01:37,858 --> 00:01:46,959
by Thor's rock, he calls it Ragnarock, the Sakaar
Arena event is going on, where you team up with

19
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:52,101
Thor in 20-person lightning rounds for prizes.
Grog would not have to team up with anyone to win

20
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:58,475
in any arena, because Grog is already the champion
named Philip. You can load-down this Marvel Puzzle

21
00:01:58,475 --> 00:02:07,815
Quest for free! That means no gold, Vax-- Vex.
Fuck! You can download it at the Apple Store. I

22
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:16,667
like apples! Google Play. I like to play! Or the
Amazon app store. I like amazons. Or Steam! I

23
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:22,185
don't like steam. It is angry water and it makes
my face hurt. Also, ale. The end.

24
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:25,979
LIAM: How did you do that without moving your
mouth?

25
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,057
TRAVIS: It was a long online tutoring session that
Sam paid a lot of money for.

26
00:02:30,057 --> 00:02:31,774
SAM: Pike wrote it down.

27
00:02:31,774 --> 00:02:34,691
TRAVIS: Yeah, Pike got it all down, that's right.
Thank you, Sam.

28
00:02:34,691 --> 00:02:37,020
LAURA: That sounded just like him.

29
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,751
SAM: My voice acting is good.

30
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:45,300
TRAVIS: Right?! It's super good. Announcements! Do
we have some merches?

31
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:51,065
LAURA: Oh, well! In addition to our Vox Machina
dice that came out last week, we've got this

32
00:02:51,065 --> 00:02:55,696
amazing, oh, you know, "How do you want to do
this?" scarf! I think I'm holding it upside down.

33
00:02:55,696 --> 00:03:01,620
How do you want to do this! Yeah, yours is out in
the kitchen.

34
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,935
LIAM: It is soft.

35
00:03:02,935 --> 00:03:07,404
LAURA: It's soft and wonderful. We wanted this
last year for Christmas or holidays, and then it

36
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:11,557
didn't happen, so it's this year and it's
beautiful and amazing.

37
00:03:11,557 --> 00:03:14,592
LIAM: It's not one of those scritchy-scratchy
scarves. It's soft.

38
00:03:14,592 --> 00:03:19,474
TALIESIN: It's even what passes for cold out here
in beautiful California.

39
00:03:19,474 --> 00:03:22,622
LAURA: If it's not cold, you can hang it on your
wall. It's a good banner.

40
00:03:22,622 --> 00:03:25,455
TRAVIS: It looks so nice.

41
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,305
LAURA: It's beautiful and we love it.

42
00:03:27,305 --> 00:03:28,552
TRAVIS: That's gorgeous.

43
00:03:28,552 --> 00:03:35,020
LAURA: Isn't it? You could wear it with your
hoodie, or a t-shirt, or some Critical Role socks.

44
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,229
You could wear it with your Critical Role hat and
be full-on-- oh my god, I want to see someone

45
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:41,487
decked full.

46
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,281
SAM: That would be amazing. Wearing all the
shirts.

47
00:03:43,281 --> 00:03:46,544
LAURA: All the shirts, and the hoodie, and the
hat, and maybe the necklace.

48
00:03:46,544 --> 00:03:48,143
TALIESIN: And it's on Twitter.

49
00:03:48,143 --> 00:03:53,790
SAM: Did we ever have socks? We have socks. I
don't own the socks!

50
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,278
LAURA: I have so many extra pairs at home.

51
00:03:56,278 --> 00:04:00,269
TALIESIN: It was your pun! You were the one who
demanded Socks Machina.

52
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:03,030
LAURA: I was the one who was supposed to pass them
out, but then I didn't.

53
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:09,280
TRAVIS: Other announcements. Some of you will be
attending PAX Unplugged in Philadelphia. Is that

54
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,671
correct? Yes? Who?

55
00:04:11,671 --> 00:04:13,940
LIAM: M & M, and you and I, Tal.

56
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,065
TALIESIN: Yes, M & M and L & T.

57
00:04:16,065 --> 00:04:19,011
LIAM: Not Marshall Mathers. We meant Matt and
Marisha.

58
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:22,594
TRAVIS: Matt and Marisha. Yeah. It's November--

59
00:04:22,594 --> 00:04:24,053
TALIESIN: It's in two weeks.

60
00:04:24,053 --> 00:04:26,342
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't remember the exact date--

61
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:28,455
TALIESIN: The weekend of November 17th.

62
00:04:28,455 --> 00:04:32,365
TRAVIS: Right. Friday, I think, everything is on?
If you're going to PAX Unplugged, find these

63
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:39,067
patsies and go and see them. They will be there.
Patsies? I said Pats Unplugged, so I tried to play

64
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:42,484
it off of Patsy. We will be in Australia. We'll be
at Supanova.

65
00:04:42,484 --> 00:04:44,324
LAURA: Yeah, the other L & T!

66
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:47,378
TRAVIS: That's right! For two weeks in November,
we'll be at Adelaide and Brisbane. So, if you're

67
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:49,180
Down Under, come see us.

68
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,275
LAURA: How you feeling, baby?

69
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:56,282
TRAVIS: Oh man, this is terrible. This is awful.
This is great.

70
00:04:56,282 --> 00:04:58,700
LAURA: I can see this long-distance stare.

71
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,593
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, thousand-yard stare? Pretty much.
Anything else? What am I forgetting?

72
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:09,145
LIAM: Couple things. Next week, Marisha will be in
your chair, running a game of Honey Heist.

73
00:05:09,145 --> 00:05:11,337
TRAVIS: No idea what that is.

74
00:05:11,337 --> 00:05:13,284
LIAM: We're all bears.

75
00:05:13,284 --> 00:05:14,789
LAURA: Except Travis and I won't be there.

76
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:15,931
SAM: We're all bears?

77
00:05:15,931 --> 00:05:18,866
LIAM: They're not bears, but the three of us and
everyone else who's going to be here are going to

78
00:05:18,866 --> 00:05:21,571
be bears. It's the worst episode for you not to be
here.

79
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,662
LAURA: I know! I'm missing the Honey Heist!

80
00:05:23,662 --> 00:05:28,248
TRAVIS: Yes. Oh, we do have one last announcement.
We are excited to announce the Critical Role: Vox

81
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:34,103
Machina wrap-up. Yes. It's the pearly gates Q&A
session we've been talking about since day one. It

82
00:05:34,103 --> 00:05:40,095
will be a Talks Machina episode hosted by the
illustrious and never-stinky Brian W. Foster. Live

83
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:43,573
Thursday, December 14th, in the normal Critical
Role time slot.

84
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:45,313
LAURA: So that's a Thursday.

85
00:05:45,313 --> 00:05:49,297
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll be discussing the entirety of
the Vox Machina campaign.

86
00:05:49,297 --> 00:05:51,823
LAURA: That means we get to ask Matt all of the
secrets, and he has to tell us?

87
00:05:51,823 --> 00:05:56,380
SAM: And we can ask each other, too! I'm going to
read that letter that I wrote to Pike! All kinds

88
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,780
of shit.

89
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,322
TRAVIS: And the note that I have says, "Please
keep an eye on various social medias as we will be

90
00:06:02,322 --> 00:06:11,360
"breaking up the question submissions into five
story arcs." So more info to come on that. Yep.

91
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,683
TALIESIN: There are a few other-- I don't know if
they gave you the full page.

92
00:06:13,683 --> 00:06:15,914
LAURA: Do we all get to talk as Grog tonight?

93
00:06:15,914 --> 00:06:17,657
TALIESIN: (Grog voice) I think so, yeah.

94
00:06:17,657 --> 00:06:21,614
TRAVIS: You can, but it might get you killed.

95
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:26,763
TALIESIN: There's a few other things that
happened, also. The Critical Role podcast got

96
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:34,198
updated today. It now goes to 70, I believe. We're
now at episode 70. It goes all the way to 70 now.

97
00:06:34,198 --> 00:06:35,744
I know, it's great.

98
00:06:35,744 --> 00:06:37,699
TRAVIS: I know what that number is.

99
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:41,025
TALIESIN: We're also, some of us are going to be
at BlizzCon tomorrow.

100
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,431
LAURA: Oh, that's right!

101
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:52,424
TALIESIN: You can find us. There's a Geek and
Sundry panel at 4:00 on the Epic stage at

102
00:06:52,424 --> 00:06:56,819
BlizzCon. I have this in my head. Now that I don't
have a game in my head, all of this new

103
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:03,127
information has flooded through. Also, Phil LaMarr
is coming onto the Wednesday Club next week to

104
00:07:03,127 --> 00:07:10,222
talk Thor and his hammer. It's going to be fun. I
was asked to inform everyone that there's going to

105
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:15,330
be no Gather Your Party, because BlizzCon, so
instead it's going to be Tales from the Loop with

106
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:21,221
Amy Dallen, Vorpahl, Sax, Rachel, Gina, and Kelly
Del Angelo is going to be GMing, and it's going to

107
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:23,894
be nuts. That'll be Friday while we're partying at
BlizzCon.

108
00:07:23,894 --> 00:07:32,121
LAURA: Can I say one more? What? It was just
announced that I joined the cast of Last of Us 2!

109
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:35,801
LIAM: Look at these guns!

110
00:07:35,801 --> 00:07:39,534
SAM: Everyone, do your Laura Bailey impression!

111
00:07:39,534 --> 00:07:48,916
LAURA: Check out that trailer if you feel like
feeling shaky and, yeah. It's pretty brutal.

112
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,757
SAM: She plays the car that's on fire.

113
00:07:50,757 --> 00:07:51,825
LAURA: That's right.

114
00:07:51,825 --> 00:07:53,364
LIAM: Feel-good game of the year.

115
00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:54,481
LAURA: I'm very excited.

116
00:07:54,481 --> 00:07:57,343
TRAVIS: And you haven't told me anything about it.
Nothing.

117
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,171
LIAM: Did you even know she was in the game?

118
00:07:59,171 --> 00:08:00,487
TRAVIS: In what game?

119
00:08:00,487 --> 00:08:03,164
LAURA: It's all NDAs, you know. We're not allowed
to share it with anybody.

120
00:08:03,164 --> 00:08:11,968
LIAM: No duh! Also, tomorrow will be the first
character playlist. It will be mine, so you can

121
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:13,870
find it sometime tomorrow.

122
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,148
SAM: Shit, I never did mine.

123
00:08:15,148 --> 00:08:16,471
LIAM: You've got time!

124
00:08:16,471 --> 00:08:18,771
TRAVIS: Yeah, I didn't do it. I barely did this.

125
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:21,100
LIAM: It'll drop sometime tomorrow.

126
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,295
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay!

127
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:28,932
TRAVIS: Anything else? Is that it? Okay. I guess
if we have no other distractions--

128
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:36,524
LIAM: Madness! Yeah, episode two dropped on
Project Alpha today. It's pretty great, it's

129
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:37,832
pretty spooky.

130
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:42,972
LAURA: I want to point out that Keyleth's dice
just rolled a one. No, I don't have my dice jail

131
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:49,862
with me. But I rolled an 18 on my own personal
dice. I rolled the best. No, Matt's roll was a

132
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,969
natural 20. So those ones stay out.

133
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:57,280
TRAVIS: All right, fuck it! No more stalling! It's
time for you guys to die. With that, we're going

134
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:12,416
to roll some credits for tonight's episode of
(long inhale) Critical Role. (guttural noises)

135
00:09:12,416 --> 00:10:42,830
[dramatic music]

136
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:50,995
TRAVIS: I like that. I expected a little bit more. We
start this game as you guys playing your

137
00:10:50,995 --> 00:10:57,727
characters. Grog has asked all of his members, all
of his fellow warriors in Vox Machina, to join him

138
00:10:57,727 --> 00:11:03,907
in Scanlan's Magnificent Mansion for a game that
he has heard about.

139
00:11:03,907 --> 00:11:07,442
SAM: You're turning into Grog right now?

140
00:11:07,442 --> 00:11:13,453
TRAVIS: What? Yeah. Oh my god! Guys, you're all
here! Oh, thank god. Did anyone have the salad?

141
00:11:13,453 --> 00:11:21,275
SAM: Yeah, yes, they just whipped up a fresh batch
of tzatziki sauce to go with it.

142
00:11:21,275 --> 00:11:25,664
TRAVIS: Chicken, did anybody have the chicken
instead of the salad?

143
00:11:25,664 --> 00:11:27,505
LAURA: No chicken. There's no more chicken, Grog.

144
00:11:27,505 --> 00:11:32,884
TRAVIS: I was making sure it wasn't me. Hey, look,
I know we've got a night to ourselves. I was

145
00:11:32,884 --> 00:11:36,311
wondering if maybe we could all, like, play a game
I heard about.

146
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:39,974
SAM: I mean, should I go wake up the others?

147
00:11:39,974 --> 00:11:47,070
TRAVIS: No, no. I don't think so. It's a little
above their head. Yeah, it's only for us big

148
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:53,154
thinkers. Okay. Yeah. So, I was in this tavern the
other day, right? And I heard about this game. I

149
00:11:53,154 --> 00:11:59,628
think it's called Bunions and Flagons, right. And
you are all going to play as little, itty-bitty

150
00:11:59,628 --> 00:12:04,978
versions of yourselves. All you got to do is use
your imagination. Right? I'm going to tell you a

151
00:12:04,978 --> 00:12:10,024
story and then you contribute, tell me what you
want to do, and I draw out little maps, and we'll

152
00:12:10,024 --> 00:12:11,022
go on an adventure.

153
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,483
LAURA: So we're, like, baby versions of
ourselves?

154
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:15,891
TRAVIS: No, it's like, the size of your thumb,
like tiny. We're going to move them around. Yeah.

155
00:12:15,891 --> 00:12:19,331
LIAM: Like Tiny Vax, but tiny everybody, this time?

156
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:23,023
SAM: Grog, I'm already tiny. Even tinier?

157
00:12:23,023 --> 00:12:25,368
LAURA: You'll be the size of a pinky, maybe.

158
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:29,695
TRAVIS: Yeah, you know, you're tiny, but you've
got a big, uh, heart. What do you think?

159
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:33,267
SAM: It sounds great. I mean, this is so unlike
you.

160
00:12:33,267 --> 00:12:36,890
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, you know, I've been thinking
about it for a long time. I actually made art for

161
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:46,025
each of you guys, so like, I made Percy, right,
and then I made Vex. Right, with the ears and the

162
00:12:46,025 --> 00:12:57,007
arrows. And then there's Vax'ildan, with his
little ears bleeding. Then the Scanlan.

163
00:12:57,007 --> 00:12:59,225
LAURA: That looks just like you!

164
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:01,361
SAM: The eyes are haunting.

165
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:03,200
LIAM: That's drawn to scale, that one.

166
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:09,243
SAM: That's amazing! Wait, did you draw Grog? I
guess you're not playing with us? How does this work?

167
00:13:09,243 --> 00:13:11,790
TRAVIS: Oh shit. No, I am playing with you. I'll
be there.

168
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:17,903
LIAM: Is there a ball involved in this game? A
ball? Games are typically-- ball, a ball.

169
00:13:17,903 --> 00:13:22,435
TRAVIS: Not a bowl, but a ball. Not a bowl you eat
out of, but a ball.

170
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:28,672
LIAM: Not that my father ever played catch with
me, but you know, the type of ball that one would

171
00:13:28,672 --> 00:13:31,961
play catch with, with one's father, if they gave a
shit.

172
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:34,101
TRAVIS: No, no ball.

173
00:13:34,101 --> 00:13:36,264
LIAM: What kind of game is it, then?

174
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:40,070
TRAVIS: I'm going to put everything on this big
table in front of us. It'll be right in front of

175
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,916
you, and you get to sit in your chair.

176
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,202
TALIESIN: Like cards, then?

177
00:13:43,202 --> 00:13:44,477
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's pretty nice.

178
00:13:44,477 --> 00:13:47,286
LAURA: Can your servants bring over some liquor?
Because I think we're going to need it.

179
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:49,712
SAM: Keep the wine coming!

180
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:55,178
TRAVIS: Yeah, always a good idea, when playing
this game, to drink heavily.

181
00:13:55,178 --> 00:13:56,519
LIAM: Vegan wine, yeah.

182
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,137
TRAVIS: Yes, all right, so.

183
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:02,685
SAM: I should warn you, I'm a power gamer.

184
00:14:02,685 --> 00:14:04,879
TRAVIS: Power gamer?

185
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,879
SAM: Yeah, you know, I get really into it.

186
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:14,597
TRAVIS: In your brain theaters, all right, I want
you to imagine that Vox Machina has been

187
00:14:14,597 --> 00:14:17,836
successful on its latest mission. We are
triumphant!

188
00:14:17,836 --> 00:14:19,103
LAURA: As always.

189
00:14:19,103 --> 00:14:25,414
TRAVIS: As always. It's the wee hours of the
morning, and we have found our way to a tavern.

190
00:14:25,414 --> 00:14:33,301
Small, maybe off the beaten path, right. It's
shambly outside. We go in and it's deserted,

191
00:14:33,301 --> 00:14:38,037
right? There's only like one other couple in the
whole fucking place. We got the run of the lot. We

192
00:14:38,037 --> 00:14:44,232
go in. It's time to drink. We're raising glasses,
we're cheering, we're drinking. Everybody's

193
00:14:44,232 --> 00:14:48,677
boozing, right? Yeah! Who wants to make a toast?

194
00:14:48,677 --> 00:14:50,785
LIAM: This is the game?

195
00:14:50,785 --> 00:14:59,082
SAM: I'll make a toast. I'll make a toast, yeah.
(clears throat) Right then! My character has a

196
00:14:59,082 --> 00:15:01,030
different accent than Scanlan does.

197
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,729
TRAVIS: You're just playing you, though.

198
00:15:02,729 --> 00:15:04,644
SAM: Well, I know, but I want to get into it,
right?

199
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:06,023
LAURA: No, I like it.

200
00:15:06,023 --> 00:15:13,335
SAM: Right then, we did a really good job in the
fight today! So I think that we should all propose

201
00:15:13,335 --> 00:15:23,578
a toast to the one that fell. Keyleth. I'm sorry
she'll never be joining us again. To Keyleth.

202
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:26,288
LIAM: That's an odd story choice to make.

203
00:15:26,288 --> 00:15:35,220
TRAVIS: Cheers, yeah. To Keyleth. Underpowered her
whole life, really. Nothing at her disposal.

204
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,723
LIAM: The last of us.

205
00:15:36,723 --> 00:15:41,971
TRAVIS: May her memory live forever.

206
00:15:41,971 --> 00:15:43,377
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

207
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:51,163
TRAVIS: As we are drinking, and we're on, like--
What's a big number? Our second cup. Everybody's

208
00:15:51,163 --> 00:15:57,884
really starting to feel it a little bit,
especially our little gnome, Pike. Pike gets up on

209
00:15:57,884 --> 00:16:07,156
the table, right. She's like-- Pike! Flower! My
friend. Pike gets up and she's like, "You guys, I

210
00:16:07,156 --> 00:16:11,013
"love being your friend."

211
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:14,127
TALIESIN: Too real.

212
00:16:14,127 --> 00:16:16,368
LIAM: The dimensional distortion there for a
second!

213
00:16:16,368 --> 00:16:25,421
TRAVIS: "I'm really, like, all of your friend! You
are good!" And she turns to you, Vex, yeah, and

214
00:16:25,494 --> 00:16:34,121
she's like, "You know, we're so close! And you
know, I--" (gulping) And you start to see, right,

215
00:16:34,121 --> 00:16:39,013
that maybe she's had one too many, which is really
saying something for that little tank. She goes,

216
00:16:39,013 --> 00:16:45,778
"Ah, nope. I got it-- urp!" And in that moment you
start to see all the color come up to her face. I

217
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:48,482
need you to roll a dexterity check.

218
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:49,601
LAURA: Okay.

219
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:52,138
SAM: What does that mean? What's a dexterity
check?

220
00:16:52,138 --> 00:16:53,879
TRAVIS: I don't know, I heard a guy at the bar say
it.

221
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:59,846
LAURA: I'm going to roll one of these fancy gems
that I have. All right. Oh, that's really good! Oh

222
00:16:59,846 --> 00:17:09,657
wait, just a check? 11 plus-- 18. No, 29! That
means it's 29.

223
00:17:09,657 --> 00:17:11,387
SAM: How do you know what to add?

224
00:17:11,387 --> 00:17:13,785
LAURA: I'm really smart! I'm very smart.

225
00:17:13,785 --> 00:17:19,720
TRAVIS: Yeah, totally, right. So, 29, that's
great! At the last moment you see what is bound to

226
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,931
be a shoot of vomit in your face and you just,
boop! Duck out of the way. She catches it with her

227
00:17:24,931 --> 00:17:29,036
lips and this little stream of bile comes, like,
shooting out and goes over your shoulder.

228
00:17:29,036 --> 00:17:34,403
LAURA: I want to grab a glass and try to catch it
in a mug. So it doesn't get all over the floor,

229
00:17:34,403 --> 00:17:35,442
you know.

230
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:39,640
TRAVIS: You raise the glass right in front of her
face. As she sees it, she sees more alcohol in the

231
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:46,800
glass, and she goes, "Mm!" and turns away, and
paints the bar. Except that other couple that was

232
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:53,278
in the bar with you, they're right in the path of
her destruction. Yeah. And she Alphabits and

233
00:17:53,278 --> 00:18:01,252
Lucky Charms all over the place. All over the
table on this couple. You see, as this gentleman,

234
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:10,591
this greenish-skinned with large lower teeth and a
hood and a cloak, stands up and starts to turn

235
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:15,793
toward you. He's like, "What the fuck?"

236
00:18:15,793 --> 00:18:20,863
LAURA: <i>So</i> sorry about all of the vomit.

237
00:18:20,863 --> 00:18:22,919
TRAVIS: "Yeah. Is she with you?"

238
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,450
LAURA: Yes, she is.

239
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:30,919
TRAVIS: Well, I'm sure you guys are going to take
care of this, right? I mean, it's in my drink,

240
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:36,429
"it's on my food, it's on my--" And you see with
him is also this very lovely lady. She's got

241
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:42,464
slightly bluish skin and she is also, like,
staring in revulsion at all of this mess that

242
00:18:42,464 --> 00:18:47,503
she's wearing. Right? It's on her. Maybe there's a
little bit hanging off of her lip. She starts to

243
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:50,274
go, "Wha-- (gulping) what--"

244
00:18:50,274 --> 00:18:54,783
LAURA: Oh, no! I hold the cup under her mouth as
well.

245
00:18:54,783 --> 00:19:01,175
TRAVIS: She holds it in, but this really
infuriates this half-orc looking gentleman. He

246
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:09,401
stands up, right? and he's like, "That's it. You
and I-- You! You and I, we're coming to blows. I

247
00:19:09,401 --> 00:19:11,100
"want answers for this."

248
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,872
LIAM: I was just standing here!

249
00:19:13,872 --> 00:19:18,080
TRAVIS: "Nope, I've stood up! I'm making a point
that doesn't make any difference, and I'm too

250
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,837
"embarrassed to back down now."

251
00:19:19,837 --> 00:19:24,102
LIAM: Yes, but wait one second. Grog, you're very
good at this. Have you been spending time at the

252
00:19:24,102 --> 00:19:25,933
theater and not telling us?

253
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:27,614
TRAVIS: What's a theater?

254
00:19:27,614 --> 00:19:33,371
LIAM: Let's fight this fucking guy! What do I do?
Do I actually use this, or what do I do? Are we

255
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:34,496
fighting?

256
00:19:34,496 --> 00:19:37,936
TRAVIS: Nope, imagination weapons. Yeah. You tell
me what you want to do.

257
00:19:37,936 --> 00:19:42,829
LIAM: I would like to poke him in the eyes.

258
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:44,065
TRAVIS: With what?

259
00:19:44,065 --> 00:19:45,101
LIAM: These.

260
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:51,299
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah! Okay. So, you, yeah! Take one of
those big, globular, like, d20 dices.

261
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:56,555
LIAM: All right, I'm going to use this weird--

262
00:19:56,555 --> 00:19:58,616
TRAVIS: The mansion provides.

263
00:19:58,616 --> 00:20:00,901
LIAM: I'm going to use this weird purple one,
where you can't read the numbers on it.

264
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:02,779
TRAVIS: Roll to hit.

265
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:07,930
LIAM: I think it says 13. And what?

266
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:15,780
TRAVIS: The servants bring over a sheet that has
modifiers for you to use. Yeah. These are things

267
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,107
you add.

268
00:20:17,107 --> 00:20:18,608
LAURA: What do you add to it?

269
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:25,794
LIAM: I think I'm improvising this weapon, is that
accurate? All right, so I would add, I have no

270
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:28,910
fucking idea. You know what I'm going to do? I'm
going to add my wisdom modifier.

271
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,661
LAURA: Why wisdom? No, it's strength!

272
00:20:31,661 --> 00:20:32,914
LIAM: Why would I add anything?

273
00:20:32,914 --> 00:20:34,155
TRAVIS: He's pretty wise.

274
00:20:34,155 --> 00:20:40,384
LIAM: How strong are my fingers? Is that the
point? Sure, I'll add my strength to my fingers.

275
00:20:40,384 --> 00:20:42,323
So 15.

276
00:20:42,323 --> 00:20:47,397
TRAVIS: 15? That's all you need. You, boink, right
in his eyes, and he's like, "Argh! In the eyes!"

277
00:20:47,397 --> 00:20:50,629
LIAM: That's fucking hilarious.

278
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:56,596
TRAVIS: Right. The girl stands up at the table and
she's like, "No! No, please! Not his eyes!"

279
00:20:56,596 --> 00:20:58,940
LIAM: I have four of these.

280
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,951
TRAVIS: Right, and she sees you standing there,
ready to go, and she's like, "No, please, please!"

281
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:04,422
LIAM: You threaten me all the time!

282
00:21:04,422 --> 00:21:06,053
LAURA: Yeah, but she doesn't have any weapons on
her!

283
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:07,201
LIAM: Neither do I!

284
00:21:07,201 --> 00:21:09,714
TRAVIS: Actually, do you want to see if she has
any weapons?

285
00:21:09,714 --> 00:21:11,871
LAURA: Oh, well I'm very perceptive, Grog. You
know that.

286
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:14,552
TRAVIS: Oh, you are perceptive. Right. Roll a
perception check.

287
00:21:14,552 --> 00:21:15,766
LAURA: Okay.

288
00:21:15,766 --> 00:21:18,126
LIAM: This game thinks of everything.

289
00:21:18,126 --> 00:21:20,905
LAURA: A 31.

290
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:26,034
TRAVIS: You don't see anything, unfortunately.
That's just unfortunate.

291
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:32,233
LAURA: Grog, 31 is higher than 15. 31's really
high. It's high.

292
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:37,865
TRAVIS: Right, so you see her genealogy going
back, like, four generations.

293
00:21:37,865 --> 00:21:40,880
LAURA: Do you even know what genealogy is?

294
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:47,524
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's like, you know, a blue denim.
Yeah. So you see at her side this spear that's

295
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:52,089
laying up against the table. Yeah, yeah. I don't
know how you missed it the first time. It's a

296
00:21:52,089 --> 00:21:56,964
fucking spear, right there. She stands up and
she's like, "No, no, please! No more eye-poking!"

297
00:21:56,964 --> 00:22:02,983
SAM: Grog, Grog! I'm going to try to turn
invisible, if that's all right. Can I just do that?

298
00:22:02,983 --> 00:22:05,342
TRAVIS: I don't know. Can you just do that, or do
you roll?

299
00:22:05,342 --> 00:22:06,696
SAM: I normally just do that.

300
00:22:06,696 --> 00:22:08,535
TRAVIS: Okay. Go invisible.

301
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:13,252
SAM: All right, I'm going to go invisible and I'm going
to try to swipe the spear before she gets to it.

302
00:22:13,252 --> 00:22:15,509
TRAVIS: Okay. Roll a stealth check.

303
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:24,205
SAM: Okay. Seven, plus-- ten. So, it's ten. This
many.

304
00:22:24,205 --> 00:22:28,016
TRAVIS: Ten total? Okay, great. So you go
invisible, right, and you walk over behind the

305
00:22:28,016 --> 00:22:33,155
blue-skinned lady and right as you get to the
spear, you grab for it, but there's something that

306
00:22:33,155 --> 00:22:36,870
catches your eye and you fumble the spear and it
falls to the ground.

307
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,807
SAM: Oh shite, I dropped the spear!

308
00:22:39,807 --> 00:22:47,529
TRAVIS: Good, I love it. As she hears the spear
fall, she turns and she swings her hand wildly,

309
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:54,105
catching you dead in the face. Boom! Knocks you
back. You fly back onto your back five feet. You

310
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:56,617
take two points of damage.

311
00:22:56,617 --> 00:22:58,926
LIAM: You're intelligent. Do you understand what
is happening?

312
00:22:58,926 --> 00:23:03,782
TALIESIN: Not in the least. None of this makes any
sense. These numbers seem completely arbitrary.

313
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:07,377
SAM: He's so good at this, though! I feel like we
should keep supporting this!

314
00:23:07,377 --> 00:23:09,588
LAURA: I feel like we're in a tavern right now.

315
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,311
TALIESIN: I think he might have eaten
something in the back. This is not normal.

316
00:23:12,311 --> 00:23:16,997
SAM: He's never been good at anything intellectual
and now this is it! So maybe we should support him

317
00:23:16,997 --> 00:23:18,699
and go with it.

318
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:23,091
TRAVIS: Scanlan, the reason that you fumbled for
the spear is that you saw this small little bundle

319
00:23:23,091 --> 00:23:25,804
next to her chair. In fact, it looks like--

320
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,061
LAURA: Is it a baby?

321
00:23:27,061 --> 00:23:30,958
TRAVIS: It looks like a small baby, all swaddled
up in cloth. No, small.

322
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,890
TALIESIN: Is the baby also covered in vomit?

323
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,532
LAURA: Wait, I have a question. Are we teeny at
this moment, or are we normal sized?

324
00:23:36,532 --> 00:23:40,713
TRAVIS: No, yeah, I'm going to put this out like,
what's that game where you move the--?

325
00:23:40,713 --> 00:23:42,015
SAM: Sorry?

326
00:23:42,015 --> 00:23:46,835
LAURA: Parcheesi? Checkers? Chess?

327
00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:49,748
TRAVIS: Yeah, that one! We'll be like that on a
big map.

328
00:23:49,748 --> 00:23:56,330
SAM: Really quickly into my earring, I say: She's
got a baby with her!

329
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:03,425
LAURA: Oh. Are we going to fight a baby now?

330
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:06,040
SAM: I don't know, just thought you might like to
know.

331
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:11,539
TRAVIS: Well, you're not that far from her, so she
goes, "It is a baby, it is! Please, we just want

332
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:14,166
"to leave, I'm sorry if we caused you any
trouble!"

333
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:16,332
LAURA: Does it really look like a baby?

334
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:17,705
TRAVIS: Would you want to go over to it?

335
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:19,485
LAURA: I want to go over and look at the baby.

336
00:24:19,485 --> 00:24:23,548
TRAVIS: Yeah, walk on over and make a perception
check. It's a baby.

337
00:24:23,548 --> 00:24:31,647
LIAM: I'm sorry, I know I keep slowing things down
here, but in this imagination game, can we do

338
00:24:31,647 --> 00:24:35,168
anything that we do in life?

339
00:24:35,168 --> 00:24:37,417
TRAVIS: Good question. Yeah!

340
00:24:37,417 --> 00:24:39,968
LIAM: Can we do things that we can't do in life?

341
00:24:39,968 --> 00:24:42,718
TRAVIS: You can try.

342
00:24:42,718 --> 00:24:46,936
LIAM: That sent a shiver down my spine.

343
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:51,105
TRAVIS: Pretty much, if you get an idea and you
want to try it, you ask me. We'll roll a dice.

344
00:24:51,105 --> 00:24:53,478
Then I'll let you know how it goes.

345
00:24:53,478 --> 00:25:01,487
LIAM: I would like to cast Faerie Fire.

346
00:25:01,487 --> 00:25:03,615
SAM: You don't do that.

347
00:25:03,615 --> 00:25:07,751
LIAM: Yes I do. I had the craziest dream last
night, Scanlan.

348
00:25:07,751 --> 00:25:11,305
SAM: That you became part druid?

349
00:25:11,305 --> 00:25:16,001
LIAM: Yeah. And then I died, and then I wasn't
here, and then I was. And then there was like,

350
00:25:16,001 --> 00:25:24,194
three weeks where I was a father in this other
city, washing dishes, and I had this "car." There

351
00:25:24,194 --> 00:25:28,208
were no horses but it was just wind. I had these
kids. I don't know who these kids were.

352
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:30,961
TALIESIN: I feel like we have warned you about
eating cheese before bed.

353
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:39,103
TRAVIS: The moldy cheese. The point of this is,
there's a small baby, right, and you've got a

354
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:44,627
couple covered in puke, and she's asking if maybe
they can leave instead of-- avoid further scrum.

355
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:49,315
LAURA: Well, I fink we should let them leave! I
"fink?" I'm listening to Grog too much!

356
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:52,612
LIAM: I'm going to save that for later. I'm going
to put these away.

357
00:25:52,612 --> 00:26:01,039
TRAVIS: You see his demeanor, like, he totally
goes, like, another eye-poking avoided. Whoosh.

358
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:09,024
Right? He says, "All right. People make mistakes.
Try to enjoy the rest of your night." He goes over

359
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:13,091
and gets his blue-skinned wife up, and she grabs
her little bundle, and they start to make their

360
00:26:13,091 --> 00:26:14,726
way out of the tavern.

361
00:26:14,726 --> 00:26:16,202
TALIESIN: I grab the spear.

362
00:26:16,202 --> 00:26:17,145
TRAVIS: You do?

363
00:26:17,145 --> 00:26:20,791
TALIESIN: Yes. They didn't take it, so I will take
it now. It's my spear.

364
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:27,219
LAURA: That's terrible! They do seem suspicious.
Can I read their lips on the way out? Are they

365
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:29,961
talking? Can I read their lips?

366
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:31,418
TRAVIS: Sure.

367
00:26:31,418 --> 00:26:32,734
LAURA: What are they saying?

368
00:26:32,734 --> 00:26:34,073
TRAVIS: Roll a d20.

369
00:26:34,073 --> 00:26:36,385
LIAM: Everybody seems to know what's going on.

370
00:26:36,385 --> 00:26:39,139
LAURA: Am I adding anything to it?

371
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,734
TRAVIS: Perception. Do a perception check.

372
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:42,506
SAM: Just "yes, and," Vax. Yes, and.

373
00:26:42,506 --> 00:26:48,638
LAURA: 24. That's good.

374
00:26:48,638 --> 00:26:53,961
TRAVIS: Whoa. So you see that she's actually going
like, "That was so embarrassing. I want to go home

375
00:26:53,961 --> 00:26:59,298
"and take my clothes off and you and I go and we'll
have a great night."

376
00:26:59,298 --> 00:27:02,023
LAURA: Okay, I think they really want to go bone.

377
00:27:02,023 --> 00:27:04,051
TRAVIS: Yeah, lots of boning in their
future.

378
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:09,105
TALIESIN: I wish to examine the spear. Is it a
special spear? Is it an interesting spear? Does it

379
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:11,026
do anything? Does it require batteries?

380
00:27:11,026 --> 00:27:17,951
TRAVIS: Batteries? What are batteries? You see the
spear is a long wooden pole wrapped with some

381
00:27:17,951 --> 00:27:25,129
cloth where you might hold it with your hands. At
the tip is a very rusted metal sharp point at the

382
00:27:25,129 --> 00:27:32,957
tip. You got yourself a spear. So now, now you
truly have the tavern to yourself. It's just us

383
00:27:32,957 --> 00:27:40,770
five. Yeah. You see Grog sitting there and he's
aghast at how rude Pike was to puke all over this

384
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:45,913
couple, and that you would go and poke them in the
eyes. Grog's very dignified. No, that's not true.

385
00:27:45,913 --> 00:27:52,364
Grog goes over to Pike and goes, "Okay, Pikey-poo,
maybe it's time to, let's put you to sleep

386
00:27:52,364 --> 00:27:59,327
"upstairs. Barkeep!" And you look behind the
tavern, and there is a-- fuck, in your mind, he's

387
00:27:59,327 --> 00:28:00,726
fucking over there.

388
00:28:00,726 --> 00:28:02,688
TALIESIN: It's a muscle reaction, it's
inevitable.

389
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:07,765
TRAVIS: He might be over there in a second. Stay
with me. So Grog picks up Pike and goes over to

390
00:28:07,765 --> 00:28:15,855
the barkeep and he's like, "Do you have any rooms
that I can put this little gnome in?" And he's

391
00:28:15,855 --> 00:28:20,911
like, "Yes, I have, I do! Have rooms!"

392
00:28:20,911 --> 00:28:25,058
SAM: Good voice, Grog!

393
00:28:25,058 --> 00:28:33,377
TRAVIS: (wheezing) "How much money do you have?"
And Grog's like, "I have ten gold." And he's like,

394
00:28:33,377 --> 00:28:41,572
"Sure, that'll fucking do it!" So Grog goes and
takes Pike upstairs, puts her in a room, comes

395
00:28:41,572 --> 00:28:44,447
back down. And like, "Whoa, she is hammered."

396
00:28:44,447 --> 00:28:46,529
LAURA: Ten gold for a room, Grog, is a lot.

397
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:50,673
TRAVIS: I don't know if you know, but I'm super
rich because I never really buy anything.

398
00:28:50,673 --> 00:28:53,569
LAURA: You do buy some things.

399
00:28:53,569 --> 00:28:59,478
TRAVIS: I always seem to find the money. That's
what I do. Find the money. So now, it turns out

400
00:28:59,478 --> 00:29:05,266
that your cups are all slightly emptier than
before. Your plates are rather empty. It doesn't

401
00:29:05,266 --> 00:29:12,721
really seem like we want the night to end. Does
somebody want to maybe check with the barkeep and

402
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:14,623
see if he has any more?

403
00:29:14,623 --> 00:29:18,241
LIAM: Grog-- not Grog, but Grog-- did we get any
points?

404
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:19,916
TRAVIS: Points?

405
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:22,089
SAM: He does not understand this game.

406
00:29:22,089 --> 00:29:24,687
TRAVIS: Oh, right. Oh! Like, did we do something
right?

407
00:29:24,687 --> 00:29:25,916
LIAM: Did we win?

408
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:32,997
TRAVIS: No. Actually, like, at the end of this
story, you either win or lose, like, overall.

409
00:29:32,997 --> 00:29:37,369
LAURA: Oh, are you going to judge us? Does one of
us win more than other people?

410
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:38,812
TRAVIS: Potentially.

411
00:29:38,812 --> 00:29:40,819
TALIESIN: Did you not take any drama classes as a
child?

412
00:29:40,819 --> 00:29:42,652
LAURA: I'm going to win so good.

413
00:29:42,652 --> 00:29:43,998
TRAVIS: Don't you like the theater?

414
00:29:43,998 --> 00:29:48,698
LIAM: I love the theater. But we're playing a
game!

415
00:29:48,698 --> 00:29:52,718
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, no, it's one big long game.
Preferably three to four hours long.

416
00:29:52,718 --> 00:29:58,805
LAURA: That's a long game, Grog.

417
00:29:58,805 --> 00:30:01,909
LIAM: I thought we were near the end of the game,
but we're just getting started?

418
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:04,382
TRAVIS: Oh, we're just kicking this shit off. Get
comfy.

419
00:30:04,382 --> 00:30:10,540
SAM: If we're going to be here for a while, Grog,
can I have some of my invisible servants come in

420
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:17,935
and lightly play a light accompaniment music? Play
some strings or flutes?

421
00:30:17,935 --> 00:30:20,417
TRAVIS: Set the tone, the mood? Totally.

422
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:24,452
SAM: Oh there it is, it's nice.

423
00:30:24,452 --> 00:30:31,255
TRAVIS: Hold on, can you ask them to bring in
some, like, meats? Like a meat and cheese plate?

424
00:30:31,255 --> 00:30:32,698
SAM: I actually can't.

425
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:35,653
TRAVIS: Come on, Kaylie won't fucking know,
please! I'm so tired of this green shit!

426
00:30:35,653 --> 00:30:39,232
SAM: I will know. She'll be able to read it on my
face. She can see all of my lies.

427
00:30:39,232 --> 00:30:42,626
LIAM: It's a game! It's make-believe!

428
00:30:42,626 --> 00:30:47,263
SAM: Oh, if it's make-believe, then, here you go!
Here are your meats for you, right there!

429
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:51,134
TRAVIS: Nope, you got to stay in the game. That's
only in the game with that stuff. So you're in the

430
00:30:51,134 --> 00:30:56,056
tavern. You need more to drink. Who wants to go
talk to the barkeep?

431
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:57,486
TALIESIN: I'll go talk to the barkeep.

432
00:30:57,486 --> 00:30:59,033
TRAVIS: What do you do?

433
00:30:59,033 --> 00:31:02,155
TALIESIN: Another round for everyone. Your
finest.

434
00:31:02,155 --> 00:31:03,305
TRAVIS: "Eh?"

435
00:31:03,305 --> 00:31:07,027
TALIESIN: (shouting) Another round for everyone!
Your finest!

436
00:31:07,027 --> 00:31:11,215
TRAVIS: "Oh yes, yeah, oh! To drink, or to eat?"

437
00:31:11,215 --> 00:31:16,366
TALIESIN: To drink! Another round of drinks! For
everyone!

438
00:31:16,366 --> 00:31:17,877
SAM: Ask him his name.

439
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:22,850
TALIESIN: Why would I do--? Your finest! What's
your name?

440
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,501
LIAM: We want to get fucked up!

441
00:31:24,501 --> 00:31:25,765
TALIESIN: Why do I care about his name?

442
00:31:25,765 --> 00:31:27,434
SAM: Because I want to hear what Grog comes up
with!

443
00:31:27,434 --> 00:31:28,474
TALIESIN: But his name is Grog!

444
00:31:28,474 --> 00:31:31,081
TRAVIS: "My name? It's Bob!"

445
00:31:31,081 --> 00:31:34,741
TALIESIN: All right, I'll admit, that is quite
charming.

446
00:31:34,741 --> 00:31:38,169
TRAVIS: "Bobaline is my full name, but people call
me Bob!"

447
00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:42,369
TALIESIN: Bobaline, I feel, really, is quite
appropriate.

448
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:49,057
TRAVIS: "It's a family name. If you want more to
drink, unfortunately, I was not planning on you

449
00:31:49,057 --> 00:31:58,354
"being here. It's quite late. I do, however, have
more food in the pantry below the bar. Or, there

450
00:31:58,354 --> 00:32:02,945
"are some extra casks of ale out with the pigs."

451
00:32:02,945 --> 00:32:08,901
TALIESIN: I don't understand how a bar runs out of
alcohol after one round for five of us.

452
00:32:08,901 --> 00:32:15,121
SAM: It's not run out, he said he has more
downstairs, or there's some outside in the back.

453
00:32:15,121 --> 00:32:18,029
LAURA: I think we should go down to the cellar.

454
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:21,461
LIAM: Bobaline, are you going to go down and get
it and bring it up, or are you--

455
00:32:21,461 --> 00:32:28,369
TRAVIS: "No, unfortunately, me son is the one
who normally goes and gets it. He's not here."

456
00:32:28,369 --> 00:32:31,874
TALIESIN: What's your son's name?

457
00:32:31,874 --> 00:32:33,580
TRAVIS: "Timothy!"

458
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:38,522
TALIESIN: Bobaline and Timothy. That's excellent.
I should write that down to make sure that you

459
00:32:38,522 --> 00:32:40,843
don't forget it or screw it up later.

460
00:32:40,843 --> 00:32:44,739
SAM: Vax, he's presenting us with a choice. 
We, as a group, must make this choice together.

461
00:32:44,739 --> 00:32:47,267
LIAM: He's sending us to his basement. 
That's creepy!

462
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:50,551
TRAVIS: "Well, it's not a huge deal, I just need
one of you to either go down and get the food,

463
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,818
"and one of you to go get the ale."

464
00:32:52,818 --> 00:32:56,212
LAURA: You and I will go down to the cellar.

465
00:32:56,212 --> 00:33:02,445
TRAVIS: "Yeah, you go down to the cellar, and
Grog-- I will go get the ale, unless somebody

466
00:33:02,445 --> 00:33:05,222
"wants to go out in the pig sty. I'll go."

467
00:33:05,222 --> 00:33:07,845
LIAM: We will go with you, Grog, to the pig sty.

468
00:33:07,845 --> 00:33:09,732
TRAVIS: "Or do you two want to go get the ale?"

469
00:33:09,732 --> 00:33:12,975
SAM: I volunteer to go to the sty.

470
00:33:12,975 --> 00:33:18,938
TRAVIS: Okay, cool. So you, Vax, and Sam,
you make your way out back. Scanlan!

471
00:33:18,938 --> 00:33:26,020
LIAM: I'm not going to the basement, because once,
in Syngorn, a comic book shop owner tried to get

472
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:32,619
me to go to the basement to look at comic books,
and I'm not doing that. Yeah. So good luck in the

473
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:35,109
cellar. Let's go see the pigs.

474
00:33:35,109 --> 00:33:41,600
TRAVIS: As Vax and Scanlan start to head 
toward the back door, Vex and Percy,

475
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,358
would you like to try and find 
the latch under the bar that leads--

476
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:47,379
LAURA: Yes, we would.

477
00:33:47,379 --> 00:33:56,121
TRAVIS: You find it. Fuck, it's right there.
Good job. Right, so you lift the latch in the

478
00:33:56,121 --> 00:34:02,538
floor and you go down. It's a very small room that
has different salted meats and cheeses, and some

479
00:34:02,538 --> 00:34:04,575
bread and stuff like that.

480
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:06,139
TALIESIN: This cellar has better food 
than your mansion.

481
00:34:06,139 --> 00:34:07,948
LAURA: We take it all.

482
00:34:07,948 --> 00:34:09,676
TRAVIS: You take armfuls?

483
00:34:09,676 --> 00:34:11,873
LAURA: After a little bit.

484
00:34:11,873 --> 00:34:15,625
TRAVIS: I mean, do you want to see maybe what else
is down there?

485
00:34:15,982 --> 00:34:18,198
LAURA: Yeah, let's see what else is down there.

486
00:34:18,198 --> 00:34:22,369
TRAVIS: Roll perception checks.

487
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:26,106
LAURA: Oh, this is good. 28.

488
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,472
TALIESIN: 23.

489
00:34:27,472 --> 00:34:33,899
TRAVIS: Nice. You also see three of these bottles
with hided, belted locks on it, and it says

490
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:40,912
"sandkheg" on there. It looks really, really
expensive. There's three bottles of that. Yep.

491
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:45,697
LAURA: I'm going to try to pick the lock so I can
get them. Can I do that?

492
00:34:45,697 --> 00:34:48,255
TRAVIS: Sure. What do you roll to pick a lock?

493
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:50,965
LIAM: I don't know whether to shit or go blind in
this game.

494
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:52,510
LAURA: What do I roll to pick a lock?

495
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:56,206
SAM: Vax has no idea.

496
00:34:56,206 --> 00:34:58,338
TRAVIS: What about Liam? What does Liam know?

497
00:34:58,338 --> 00:35:03,280
LIAM: Intelligence, I'd think.
Yeah, you have to know how locks work.

498
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,636
LAURA: I'd think it's dexterity or something.

499
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,593
TALIESIN: Dex proficiency, for god's sake.

500
00:35:07,593 --> 00:35:08,787
TRAVIS: Roll for it.

501
00:35:08,787 --> 00:35:10,609
LIAM: What are those words you're using?!

502
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:13,338
TALIESIN: Were you never in school? 
Have you never done this before?

503
00:35:13,338 --> 00:35:16,936
LIAM: I didn't pay attention through any of
school. I copied everything that she wrote down.

504
00:35:16,936 --> 00:35:19,207
TALIESIN: This is everything I did in school. 
I remember this game.

505
00:35:19,207 --> 00:35:20,210
LAURA: 15.

506
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:24,834
TRAVIS: Oh, that's not very good. Unfortunately,
this is a better expensive bottle of sandkheg.

507
00:35:24,834 --> 00:35:32,056
After trying to break the lock, or pick it, you
get the lockpick stuck in there. Yeah, and it's

508
00:35:32,056 --> 00:35:37,295
all fucked up. But you're really resilient and you
smash the top of the bottle. It seems stupid to

509
00:35:37,295 --> 00:35:39,398
have a lock on a glass bottle, but it works.

510
00:35:39,398 --> 00:35:41,065
LAURA: I don't want to smash the bottle.

511
00:35:41,065 --> 00:35:43,146
TRAVIS: You did it already. It's too bad.

512
00:35:43,146 --> 00:35:46,256
LAURA: Is all the drink spilling out?

513
00:35:46,256 --> 00:35:48,786
TRAVIS: No! You just smashed the top off. You have
the rest of the bottle.

514
00:35:48,786 --> 00:35:51,636
LAURA: Well, okay. That's good.

515
00:35:51,636 --> 00:35:52,638
TALIESIN: We should try it.

516
00:35:52,638 --> 00:35:53,502
LAURA: Yeah!

517
00:35:53,502 --> 00:35:55,635
TRAVIS: You got some salted meats, some cheese.

518
00:35:55,635 --> 00:36:01,636
LAURA: And this bottle of fanciness. We have to
drink it all because we can't close it back up.

519
00:36:01,636 --> 00:36:07,347
TRAVIS: You also see some dead rats in the corner,
some empty shelves, and one old leathery book.

520
00:36:07,347 --> 00:36:09,598
Yeah, it's all dusty shelves.

521
00:36:09,598 --> 00:36:10,833
TALIESIN: Oh shelves!

522
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:12,733
LAURA: Do you see anything else, Percy?

523
00:36:12,733 --> 00:36:15,569
TRAVIS: There's a leathery book on one of the
shelves.

524
00:36:15,569 --> 00:36:18,540
TALIESIN: There's a leathery book?! I'm taking the
leathery book, my god.

525
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,546
TRAVIS: Do you want to open it up?

526
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:24,606
TALIESIN: I want to read the title. 
There should be a title on the cover.

527
00:36:24,606 --> 00:36:25,683
Books have titles on covers.

528
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,549
TRAVIS: Yeah, they do. It says "Ledger."

529
00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:30,011
TALIESIN: It says "Ledger." I'm going to open up
the book.

530
00:36:30,011 --> 00:36:33,016
LAURA: While he opens it, I'm going to take a sip
of this fancy wine.

531
00:36:33,016 --> 00:36:35,441
TRAVIS: Great, yeah. Roll a constitution check.

532
00:36:35,441 --> 00:36:40,166
SAM: You've really caught onto this game quickly.

533
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,520
LAURA: 13.

534
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,052
TRAVIS: 13. Right. You take a sip, and boy does it
burn. You're like (gagging). You feel like you

535
00:36:47,052 --> 00:36:49,186
could breathe fire. It starts to spread down into
your chest.

536
00:36:49,186 --> 00:36:51,362
LAURA: Does it make me breathe fire?

537
00:36:51,362 --> 00:36:55,002
TRAVIS: No, not literal fire, like (gasps) fire.

538
00:36:55,002 --> 00:36:57,088
TALIESIN: Vex, why are you making a Keyleth face?

539
00:36:57,088 --> 00:37:01,072
LAURA: This-- what is it called?

540
00:37:01,072 --> 00:37:01,786
TRAVIS: Sandkheg.

541
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,303
LAURA: This sandkheg is really strong.

542
00:37:04,303 --> 00:37:05,786
TALIESIN: Well, I've got to try this really
quickly.

543
00:37:05,786 --> 00:37:07,568
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus.

544
00:37:07,568 --> 00:37:10,901
TALIESIN: I take a sip. Sip. Sip.

545
00:37:10,901 --> 00:37:16,694
LAURA: You have to be very careful because it's
jagged on the top.

546
00:37:16,694 --> 00:37:18,714
TALIESIN: I know, you have to be very careful
because there's broken glass.

547
00:37:18,714 --> 00:37:20,412
TRAVIS: Roll a constitution check.

548
00:37:20,412 --> 00:37:22,650
LIAM: What kind of role playing are we doing
here?

549
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:25,218
TALIESIN: The best kind. No. I rolled a four.

550
00:37:25,218 --> 00:37:28,536
TRAVIS: Yeah, so the warmth starts to spread,
right?

551
00:37:28,536 --> 00:37:29,618
TALIESIN: Oh my.

552
00:37:29,618 --> 00:37:36,126
TRAVIS: You also feel this immediate desire to
upchuck the liquid because it's so strong. In your

553
00:37:36,126 --> 00:37:41,371
rush to cover your mouth, you drop the bottle and
it shatters all over the floor.

554
00:37:41,371 --> 00:37:43,766
SAM: Do we hear it upstairs?

555
00:37:43,766 --> 00:37:45,867
TALIESIN: We speak of this never again.

556
00:37:45,867 --> 00:37:47,733
LAURA: Ever. Nobody knows.

557
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:49,599
TALIESIN: We should open the book, though.

558
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:50,462
LAURA: Yeah, let's open this ledger.

559
00:37:50,462 --> 00:37:53,993
TRAVIS: You open the book, and it's got numbers in
it with letters.

560
00:37:53,993 --> 00:37:56,789
TALIESIN: Are they in a particular order?

561
00:37:56,789 --> 00:37:59,544
TRAVIS: I guess.

562
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:12,838
TALIESIN: Using my deftness of wit, can I start to
put together some meaning to the numbers and words

563
00:38:12,838 --> 00:38:14,814
within this ledger?

564
00:38:14,814 --> 00:38:18,013
TRAVIS: Unfortunately, no, it's beyond your mental
prowess. So, back upstairs!

565
00:38:18,013 --> 00:38:19,574
TALIESIN: Goddamn it!

566
00:38:19,574 --> 00:38:23,599
LAURA: All of the food. We're carrying meat and
cheese and all of that.

567
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,147
TRAVIS: Y'all want to stay in the pantry or come
back up?

568
00:38:25,147 --> 00:38:26,594
LAURA: We did for a while.

569
00:38:26,594 --> 00:38:27,832
TRAVIS: Yeah, you stayed down there for a while?

570
00:38:27,832 --> 00:38:29,139
TALIESIN: For a while.

571
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:29,965
LAURA: And then we came back up.

572
00:38:29,965 --> 00:38:34,188
TRAVIS: Fair enough. Vax and Scanlan, y'all head
out back.

573
00:38:34,188 --> 00:38:40,202
LIAM: We're getting ale for our buddy, Grog. Got
to keep the big man hydrated.

574
00:38:40,202 --> 00:38:47,624
SAM: That's right, we have to. He'll know if we
don't get him some, so let's go sneaky back there

575
00:38:47,624 --> 00:38:50,476
to make sure there's no monsters hiding.

576
00:38:50,476 --> 00:38:52,621
LIAM: Do you know how to sneak with dice?

577
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,382
SAM: Sure!

578
00:38:54,382 --> 00:38:55,560
LIAM: How do you do it?

579
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:02,508
SAM: We tell our Bunion Master that we're going
out there to sneak around and then he'll make it

580
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:05,667
happen for us.

581
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:08,254
LIAM: Okay. Night at the Improv, here we go.

582
00:39:08,254 --> 00:39:13,964
TRAVIS: Use your imagination.You get to the back
door and you push it open. You see before you,

583
00:39:13,964 --> 00:39:23,918
right, a pen full of muck, mud and these three
large hogs rolling around in the muck. Off to the

584
00:39:23,918 --> 00:39:27,292
side, you see a large cask of ale.

585
00:39:27,292 --> 00:39:31,677
LIAM: Neither one of us are very strong, can you
do your handy thing?

586
00:39:31,677 --> 00:39:33,687
SAM: To pick it up?

587
00:39:33,687 --> 00:39:38,575
LIAM: Yeah, I don't want to get all muddy and
shit, could you just grab it from here?

588
00:39:38,575 --> 00:39:42,127
SAM: Sure I could, but shouldn't we try to lift it
first?

589
00:39:42,127 --> 00:39:45,441
LIAM: It seems to plebeian, don't you want to skip
the hard work?

590
00:39:45,441 --> 00:39:50,138
SAM: Sure, right, this is all make-'em-up. It
doesn't matter, right?

591
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:54,494
LIAM: Sure! I can make a purple hand! 
Can I make a purple hand? Why not?

592
00:39:54,494 --> 00:39:55,357
I thought it was imagination?!

593
00:39:55,357 --> 00:39:57,138
TRAVIS: No, it's not what you do.

594
00:39:57,138 --> 00:39:58,178
TALIESIN: You're imagining wrong.

595
00:39:58,178 --> 00:40:06,121
LIAM: Is my fun wrong?! I guess it is! All right,
well, show me how to handle a pig.

596
00:40:06,121 --> 00:40:08,925
SAM: I'm picking up a pig?

597
00:40:08,925 --> 00:40:12,456
LAURA: No, it's a cattle-- I'm not there. 
Yes, I am. I am still technically here.

598
00:40:12,456 --> 00:40:13,883
TRAVIS: No, actually, you're not there.

599
00:40:13,883 --> 00:40:15,962
LIAM: I'm so confused!

600
00:40:15,962 --> 00:40:21,271
TRAVIS: Percy and Vex have made their way back to
the table. You two are--

601
00:40:21,271 --> 00:40:23,388
LIAM: But we're right at the table!

602
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:26,188
TRAVIS: No, the table in the tavern. You two are
at the back hall room there.

603
00:40:26,188 --> 00:40:27,861
SAM: And we're trying to move a pig?

604
00:40:27,861 --> 00:40:29,011
LAURA: No, a cask!

605
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:30,678
SAM: That's what I thought.

606
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,515
TALIESIN: Can't tell them, you're not there!

607
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:35,878
LIAM: No, I got confused for a second because this
is confusing.

608
00:40:36,115 --> 00:40:37,764
TRAVIS: It's normally <i>my</i> job, but yeah.

609
00:40:37,764 --> 00:40:41,966
LIAM: Yeah! I'm roleplaying a little bit today.
You're going to grab the booze

610
00:40:41,966 --> 00:40:44,040
and carry it back with us.

611
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:49,184
SAM: Yeah! I'd like to cast Bigby's Hand and lift
the cask.

612
00:40:49,184 --> 00:40:49,816
TALIESIN: Don't forget the pig.

613
00:40:49,816 --> 00:40:55,758
TRAVIS: Right. It's simple enough. So Bigby's Hand
just appears around the cask and it wraps its

614
00:40:55,758 --> 00:41:00,068
purple fingers around the cask, picks it up, and
holds it in mid-air.

615
00:41:00,068 --> 00:41:07,598
SAM: All right. Come with me, O hand that holds
the cask of our dreams.

616
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:12,068
TRAVIS: Flavor. That's some good color. You guys
should really step up your fucking game. Leave it

617
00:41:12,068 --> 00:41:17,618
to the bard, but yeah. Nice job. You get 300 XP for
that performance.

618
00:41:17,618 --> 00:41:19,071
SAM: I got points!

619
00:41:19,071 --> 00:41:21,072
LIAM: What did he get?

620
00:41:21,082 --> 00:41:22,628
TRAVIS: Don't worry about it.

621
00:41:22,628 --> 00:41:26,292
SAM: Wait, I got 300 points. I'm winning!

622
00:41:26,292 --> 00:41:31,056
TRAVIS: You remember being in school and they gave
out gold stars when you did good things?

623
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:33,670
LIAM: I was daydreaming, but I guess.

624
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,335
LAURA: I'm starting to take notes.

625
00:41:35,335 --> 00:41:39,381
LIAM: But you said there were no points and you
got points?

626
00:41:39,381 --> 00:41:41,883
TRAVIS: No, they're not points. They're XP.

627
00:41:41,883 --> 00:41:44,064
SAM: What does that stand for, Grog?

628
00:41:44,064 --> 00:41:45,981
TRAVIS: Xylophone Players.

629
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:50,075
TALIESIN: 300 Xylophone Players. My god, 
you could retire on that! In fact,

630
00:41:50,075 --> 00:41:51,326
you could retire quite well on that.

631
00:41:51,326 --> 00:41:53,898
LIAM: That's a fancy word!

632
00:41:53,898 --> 00:41:56,720
TRAVIS: So you get the cask and you draw it back
over.

633
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,664
LIAM: It's no mystery that Grog likes you better
than he likes me, so--

634
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:02,444
LAURA: Shut up! Let Grog tell a story!

635
00:42:02,444 --> 00:42:03,936
TRAVIS: Did you bring the cask back to the table?

636
00:42:03,936 --> 00:42:08,972
SAM: Yes, I float it back in and I present it in
front of the barkeep and say, Bob!

637
00:42:08,972 --> 00:42:09,834
TRAVIS: "Yes?"

638
00:42:09,834 --> 00:42:11,795
SAM: Your cask awaits.

639
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:18,877
TRAVIS: "You did a really great job. You guys are
good. Good. Please, I'll give 70 percent off,

640
00:42:18,877 --> 00:42:22,068
"because shit, no one's here, so nobody will
know."

641
00:42:22,068 --> 00:42:24,972
LAURA: Great! That's wonderful. Thank you, Bob.

642
00:42:24,972 --> 00:42:33,365
TRAVIS: "So please take, enjoy. It's just you."
So you take the cask and the food back over. You

643
00:42:33,365 --> 00:42:37,131
two look a little disheveled, like you may have 
fallen down some stairs, going into the pantry.

644
00:42:37,131 --> 00:42:38,897
TALIESIN: That may have happened.

645
00:42:38,897 --> 00:42:45,369
TRAVIS: That's fucking gross. Yeah, so you pour
ale all around, you get your cups full again.

646
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:48,664
You've got a little more food into your belly, 
and you make one more toast for the night

647
00:42:48,664 --> 00:42:54,309
to your successes as warriors, victorious. 
Who wants to make a toast?

648
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:58,812
SAM: This would be a good opportunity 
for you all to get some XP.

649
00:42:58,812 --> 00:43:08,195
LAURA: Oh right. I would like to make a toast 
to the greatest fighters, to someone

650
00:43:08,195 --> 00:43:14,167
who used his smart hand to carry a cask of ale. 
This sucks. I'm really shitty.

651
00:43:14,167 --> 00:43:16,136
TRAVIS: No, that's good.

652
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:17,952
TALIESIN and LAURA: And to Grog!

653
00:43:17,952 --> 00:43:21,833
LAURA: Who's so strong and brave and very smart.

654
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:24,619
TALIESIN: Extremely intelligent.

655
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:27,671
LAURA: And to all of this meat that we get to
eat!

656
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:29,094
TRAVIS: Yeah.

657
00:43:29,094 --> 00:43:30,851
LAURA, TALIESIN, and TRAVIS: Cheers!

658
00:43:30,851 --> 00:43:33,924
TRAVIS: Everybody drink to that.

659
00:43:33,924 --> 00:43:38,939
LAURA: What did you actually call it,
the purple hand? What'd you call that?

660
00:43:38,939 --> 00:43:41,516
SAM: I call it Bigby's Hand!

661
00:43:41,516 --> 00:43:43,623
LAURA: This is not in character. 
I'm asking you.

662
00:43:43,623 --> 00:43:46,409
SAM: Oh. I call it Bigby's Hand because a man
named Bigby invented it.

663
00:43:46,409 --> 00:43:49,597
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's supposed to be us. It's a
concept.

664
00:43:49,597 --> 00:43:52,241
SAM: I don't know anything about this Bigby.

665
00:43:52,241 --> 00:43:56,054
TALIESIN: I was assuming it was actually his hand
you were manifesting, like he was a large purple--

666
00:43:56,054 --> 00:43:59,356
SAM: I learned it from another bard a long time
ago.

667
00:43:59,356 --> 00:44:00,983
LIAM: What did he play?

668
00:44:00,983 --> 00:44:02,132
TALIESIN: Was his name Bigby?

669
00:44:02,132 --> 00:44:07,847
SAM: It was a he. He was actually a stand-up
comedian. That was his thing.

670
00:44:07,847 --> 00:44:10,215
TALIESIN: Oh, so it was an applause hand?

671
00:44:10,215 --> 00:44:11,442
SAM: Yeah.

672
00:44:11,442 --> 00:44:18,455
TRAVIS: As the alcohol starts to go down the
throats into the belly, down into your belly,

673
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:21,565
the world starts to get a little hazy.

674
00:44:21,565 --> 00:44:23,338
SAM: Oh no. Did we just drink poison?

675
00:44:23,338 --> 00:44:26,734
LAURA: Oh no! Did this stupid Bobaline poison us?

676
00:44:26,972 --> 00:44:32,381
TRAVIS: You got a 150 XP for saying it. Also, you
feel a lot of warmth in your face and you feel

677
00:44:32,381 --> 00:44:38,689
almost as if the world's been tilted on you. Like
someone's pushing you around and you don't have

678
00:44:38,689 --> 00:44:45,305
much control. You reach out to steady yourself and
to warn your other friends, when all of a sudden,

679
00:44:45,305 --> 00:44:50,369
the lights go out and you feel gravity take over
and you just fall.

680
00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:52,037
TALIESIN: Timothy, is that you?

681
00:44:52,037 --> 00:44:59,543
TRAVIS: And fall, and fall. The end.

682
00:44:59,543 --> 00:45:00,743
SAM: Wait, that's it?

683
00:45:00,743 --> 00:45:02,495
TRAVIS: No, that's not the end!

684
00:45:02,923 --> 00:45:04,675
SAM: But we were just having fun!

685
00:45:04,675 --> 00:45:10,180
TRAVIS: (shouting) You come to! (normal voice)
Sorry, Chris. You come to and you're lying on the

686
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,533
floor. It's cold.

687
00:45:12,533 --> 00:45:13,935
LAURA: Do we feel drunk?

688
00:45:13,935 --> 00:45:15,673
TRAVIS: Nope.

689
00:45:15,673 --> 00:45:17,255
LIAM: Do we feel hungover?

690
00:45:17,255 --> 00:45:23,006
TRAVIS: Nope. It's cold. It feels like stone
underneath you. It's moist and damp. There's dirt

691
00:45:23,006 --> 00:45:28,359
everywhere and it feels uneven. You open your eyes
and the light of the tavern is not the same as it

692
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:34,114
was before. In fact, you're on a wood floor and
you remember, but now there's stones beneath you.

693
00:45:34,114 --> 00:45:35,611
LIAM: Do we have all our shit?

694
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:42,193
TRAVIS: You got all your stuff. You look and you
seem to be in some sort of dimly-lit cavern. You

695
00:45:42,193 --> 00:45:47,881
all look around and you see your mates around you.
All there, but the environment has changed.

696
00:45:47,881 --> 00:45:49,772
LAURA: Is there any light?

697
00:45:49,772 --> 00:45:56,663
TRAVIS: There is light. You look around and there
seem to be along these stone walls around you,

698
00:45:56,663 --> 00:45:59,712
random torches. So there is some torchlight down
here.

699
00:45:59,712 --> 00:46:01,997
SAM: He really paints a vivid picture.

700
00:46:01,997 --> 00:46:04,022
LAURA: Can I stand up?

701
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:04,868
TRAVIS: You can.

702
00:46:04,868 --> 00:46:06,557
LAURA: Can I go grab a torch?

703
00:46:06,557 --> 00:46:10,983
TRAVIS: Would you like to? They're a bit high, 
unfortunately. They're about eight to ten feet

704
00:46:10,983 --> 00:46:13,989
off the floor. It's just out of your reach.

705
00:46:13,989 --> 00:46:16,088
LAURA: Can I use my broom to fly up and grab it?

706
00:46:16,088 --> 00:46:17,544
TRAVIS: You can, if you want to.

707
00:46:17,544 --> 00:46:18,872
LAURA: Yeah, I'll grab it.

708
00:46:18,872 --> 00:46:24,490
TRAVIS: All right. So you hop onto your broom,
kick up off the ground and grab the torch. You

709
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:30,271
pull it out and off in the distance somewhere, 
you hear a scraping sound. Very faint,

710
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:32,447
but you hear it.

711
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:37,051
TALIESIN: What strange intelligence would have
gone through this hall and lit torches that were

712
00:46:37,051 --> 00:46:40,965
eight to ten feet off the ground? That's very
particular.

713
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:44,737
SAM: You have that special sense! Try to sense if
there's any flagons around?

714
00:46:44,737 --> 00:46:50,666
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to try to sense if there's
any flagons. Big ones, with wings.

715
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:52,797
TRAVIS: Roll a perception check.

716
00:46:52,797 --> 00:46:55,275
LAURA: No, it's not a perception check, 
it's just my--

717
00:46:55,275 --> 00:46:56,849
TALIESIN: Flagon sense?

718
00:46:56,849 --> 00:46:58,369
LAURA: It's my flagon sense.

719
00:46:58,369 --> 00:47:00,412
TRAVIS: Is it? Yeah. Yeah, go for it.

720
00:47:00,412 --> 00:47:02,073
LAURA: Are there any flagons around?

721
00:47:02,073 --> 00:47:04,445
TRAVIS: Yeah, no fucking flagons around.

722
00:47:04,445 --> 00:47:06,106
LAURA: I'm going to mark off a spell.

723
00:47:06,106 --> 00:47:09,302
LIAM: What are all these papers?

724
00:47:09,302 --> 00:47:13,963
TRAVIS: Currently, Vex is the only one who's
gotten to her feet and grabbed a torch. Are you

725
00:47:13,963 --> 00:47:15,872
all standing up, looking around?

726
00:47:15,872 --> 00:47:18,323
LAURA: Just be quiet. I'm going to cast Pass
Without a Trace on all of us.

727
00:47:18,323 --> 00:47:20,002
So that we're quiet.

728
00:47:20,002 --> 00:47:21,260
LIAM: Can I hide?

729
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,466
TRAVIS: Yeah.

730
00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:25,373
LIAM: I can? I'm going to hide. 
Do your thingy, though.

731
00:47:25,373 --> 00:47:28,177
TRAVIS: Yeah. Everybody please roll a stealth
check.

732
00:47:28,177 --> 00:47:29,669
LIAM: You don't have to clap or--

733
00:47:29,669 --> 00:47:33,298
LAURA: I've already cast it. I cast it already,
but roll a stealth check.

734
00:47:33,298 --> 00:47:36,128
SAM: 18, Grog!

735
00:47:36,128 --> 00:47:37,767
TRAVIS: 18. Good.

736
00:47:37,767 --> 00:47:38,606
LAURA: Add ten to it!

737
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:39,900
SAM: I did already.

738
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,158
TALIESIN: 19.

739
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:44,171
LAURA: I don't know what that means, but I don't
know why would you do that.

740
00:47:44,171 --> 00:47:45,521
TALIESIN: Why not add ten?

741
00:47:45,521 --> 00:47:47,864
SAM: Oh, we got something!
Something's happening!

742
00:47:48,046 --> 00:47:50,053
TALIESIN: Have you been at the arts and crafts?

743
00:47:50,053 --> 00:47:52,845
TRAVIS: Okay, now listen. This is where the fun
starts.

744
00:47:52,845 --> 00:47:54,473
LIAM: What are these things?

745
00:47:54,473 --> 00:47:58,078
TALIESIN: Let's not look. He's setting something
up. I'm not going to look. Close your eyes.

746
00:47:58,078 --> 00:48:01,993
SAM: Marvel Puzzle Quest. It's a fantastic game.

747
00:48:01,993 --> 00:48:03,986
LAURA: Do you need help?

748
00:48:03,986 --> 00:48:05,254
TRAVIS: No.

749
00:48:05,254 --> 00:48:07,830
SAM: It looks like two boobs.

750
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:10,167
LAURA: It looks like a butt with a staple in it.

751
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:17,926
LIAM: You've seen that before. Oh, I'm right at
the crack! Of course. That guy looks just like

752
00:48:17,926 --> 00:48:22,149
you, Grog! He looks like me! That looks like
Scanlan!

753
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,469
TALIESIN: That looks nothing like me.

754
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:24,858
LIAM: That doesn't look like you at all.

755
00:48:24,858 --> 00:48:26,355
TALIESIN: It's totally off.

756
00:48:26,355 --> 00:48:28,640
LAURA: Where's Trinket?

757
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:34,324
(gasps) Grog! Trinket's here! 
Trinket's popping out of my necklace!

758
00:48:34,324 --> 00:48:36,175
TRAVIS: There you go.

759
00:48:36,175 --> 00:48:38,858
LIAM: What, you got a fucking bear?

760
00:48:38,858 --> 00:48:40,802
TRAVIS: Look at that. You're all there.

761
00:48:40,802 --> 00:48:42,071
LIAM: Where did you get these toys?

762
00:48:42,071 --> 00:48:47,483
TRAVIS: I stole it from a small child. So as you
look around your environment, you notice the floor

763
00:48:47,483 --> 00:48:53,634
is stone, the walls are stone and you seem to be
in some sort of circular cavern. There's also a

764
00:48:53,634 --> 00:49:01,651
domed ceiling above you. There is just pure wall
for most of this circular room except for an area

765
00:49:01,651 --> 00:49:05,085
that seems to lead into another chamber beyond.

766
00:49:05,085 --> 00:49:11,850
LAURA: Oh, I have an idea! Can I shoot one of my
oracle arrows and see what's in the other room?

767
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:14,686
TRAVIS: You may. Roll an attack.

768
00:49:14,686 --> 00:49:16,977
LIAM: Also, I rolled a 39 for stealth.

769
00:49:16,977 --> 00:49:18,595
LAURA: I rolled a 45.

770
00:49:18,595 --> 00:49:22,112
LIAM: Is that good? Is 39 better or worse than
45?

771
00:49:22,112 --> 00:49:26,929
TRAVIS: It's so good, in fact, that you take one
step into the wall and you turn and face it like

772
00:49:26,929 --> 00:49:29,574
the creepy person from Blair Witch, and you stay
there.

773
00:49:29,574 --> 00:49:33,195
LAURA: 32.

774
00:49:33,195 --> 00:49:39,602
TRAVIS: 32. Great. So you turn so that you can see
into the other cavern and you shoot your oracle

775
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:47,744
arrow. And your sight goes (zooming) and you see
it fly approximately (counting) 25 feet and it

776
00:49:47,744 --> 00:49:53,779
just hits another wall made of stone in the
cavern, very similar to the one you're in.

777
00:49:53,779 --> 00:49:55,448
LAURA: It looks the exact same?

778
00:49:55,448 --> 00:49:57,431
TRAVIS: Yeah, almost identical to this one.

779
00:49:57,431 --> 00:49:59,285
LIAM: Jeez, Grog, you're inspired today.

780
00:49:59,285 --> 00:50:00,940
TALIESIN: This is very impressive.

781
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:07,929
SAM: Come on, even in this imaginary game, we're
invincible heroes of justice. Let's just go look!

782
00:50:07,929 --> 00:50:09,907
LAURA: Can we see forward? Can we see?

783
00:50:09,907 --> 00:50:12,626
LIAM: Well, hold on. We know that I like to stick
my dick into things, so why don't I creep ahead

784
00:50:12,626 --> 00:50:15,657
and see what is happening?

785
00:50:15,657 --> 00:50:17,725
TRAVIS: Very smart. Make a perception check.

786
00:50:17,725 --> 00:50:23,261
LAURA: Watch for traps! You don't want to explode,
I don't know what Grog has set up for us.

787
00:50:23,261 --> 00:50:28,244
LIAM: I'll roll this one with the book on it
because I feel goodness from it. I got a 19 on

788
00:50:28,244 --> 00:50:34,545
that, plus perception. Oh my gosh, that's really
good. 33 for perception.

789
00:50:34,545 --> 00:50:39,754
TRAVIS: You open your eyes, and because you're
staring at the wall like a nerd, you notice the

790
00:50:39,754 --> 00:50:43,985
mortar is very fine. Would anybody like to make a
perception check besides Vax?

791
00:50:43,985 --> 00:50:46,186
LAURA: I would like to look around the whole
room.

792
00:50:46,186 --> 00:50:49,087
TRAVIS: Vex, please roll a perception check.

793
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:51,734
LIAM: I didn't understand the rules!

794
00:50:51,734 --> 00:50:53,722
TALIESIN: 17 for me.

795
00:50:53,722 --> 00:50:55,312
TRAVIS: Oh, very nice, Percival.

796
00:50:55,312 --> 00:50:56,485
LAURA: 34 for me.

797
00:50:56,485 --> 00:50:59,647
TRAVIS: 34, that is a high perception. You should
be a rogue.

798
00:50:59,647 --> 00:51:03,440
LIAM: It's not as high as mine, I would like to
point out, but I was facing the wall.

799
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:10,889
TRAVIS: So you see that the room extends out to an
edge and you move to the middle and you see that

800
00:51:10,889 --> 00:51:16,571
these two rooms seem to be identical. There are
torches lighting your way, and above you on this

801
00:51:16,571 --> 00:51:24,886
rounded ceiling, there are two hatches. Iron
hatches. And above them you see maybe a chute.

802
00:51:24,886 --> 00:51:29,485
And you wonder, as you see water dripping 
from the hatches in the ceiling,

803
00:51:29,485 --> 00:51:33,066
if that might have been how you got in this room.

804
00:51:33,066 --> 00:51:35,398
LAURA: Can I use my broom to fly up and check out
that hatch?

805
00:51:35,398 --> 00:51:40,542
TRAVIS: You may. So you fly up and you get to the
hatch, and it's solid iron, with rusted-- There's

806
00:51:40,542 --> 00:51:42,760
water dripping out of it. And you see there is a
chute indeed. No light coming from it.

807
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,349
LAURA: It's bars?

808
00:51:44,349 --> 00:51:47,872
TRAVIS: Bars, but it looks as if it goes straight
up, and up, and up.

809
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:48,911
LAURA: Is it closed off?

810
00:51:48,911 --> 00:51:51,349
TRAVIS: It is. It's closed very securely.

811
00:51:51,349 --> 00:51:53,085
LAURA: Can I try to pull them?

812
00:51:53,085 --> 00:51:55,622
LIAM: May I turn around from the wall first?

813
00:51:55,622 --> 00:51:57,761
TRAVIS: You may, yes. There you go.

814
00:51:57,761 --> 00:52:05,630
LIAM: Can I use some sort of perception or
insight or one of these numbers to figure out if

815
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:07,802
we are in a room shaped like a cock and balls?

816
00:52:07,802 --> 00:52:11,713
TRAVIS: You may. Roll a perception check.

817
00:52:11,713 --> 00:52:16,071
LIAM: Okay. I've got a total of 23, Grog.

818
00:52:16,071 --> 00:52:24,266
TRAVIS: You move forward, and as you approach Vex,
you do see there is an additional hallway

819
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:34,686
that extends forward. Not in the shape
of a cock and balls per se, but there is another

820
00:52:34,686 --> 00:52:39,209
hallway in front of you, and it extends forward
into darkness, but you do see a very faint torch

821
00:52:39,209 --> 00:52:41,522
at the end of it all.

822
00:52:41,522 --> 00:52:42,927
SAM: A tip.

823
00:52:42,927 --> 00:52:44,848
TRAVIS: Tip of the hallway, yeah.

824
00:52:44,848 --> 00:52:49,891
LIAM: I'm a big fan of the show Stillben Vandal,
it's quite good.

825
00:52:49,891 --> 00:52:56,592
TRAVIS: So you are going up. Ooh, this is you!

826
00:52:56,592 --> 00:52:59,376
LAURA: Can I pull on the bars to see if I can get
out?

827
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:04,166
TRAVIS: Yeah, you pull on it, and, man, that shit
is-- Roll a strength check. I'll give you a shot.

828
00:53:04,166 --> 00:53:10,348
LAURA: Because I'm really strong, Grog. Nine.

829
00:53:10,348 --> 00:53:15,906
TRAVIS: No, no. It doesn't even move. It doesn't
even do the pothole thing. As soon as you step

830
00:53:15,906 --> 00:53:19,584
on it, it goes boop boop, I'm going to fall. 
But no, it's solid.

831
00:53:19,584 --> 00:53:22,039
LAURA: Is there a lock to be seen?

832
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:27,108
TRAVIS: Not that you can tell. If you want to
check and see if there's a latch to it.

833
00:53:27,108 --> 00:53:28,352
LAURA: I want to look and see.

834
00:53:28,352 --> 00:53:30,032
TRAVIS: Roll an investigation check.

835
00:53:30,032 --> 00:53:37,674
LAURA: Ooh, Grog, what a big word! What is that,
23? 23.

836
00:53:37,674 --> 00:53:43,144
TRAVIS: 23. You reach through one of the slots in
the plate that's holding--

837
00:53:43,144 --> 00:53:44,220
LAURA: Did you burp?

838
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,217
LIAM: I did burp.

839
00:53:45,217 --> 00:53:46,379
LAURA: Really stinky burp.

840
00:53:46,379 --> 00:53:48,098
LIAM: I love you too, Stubby.

841
00:53:48,098 --> 00:53:50,709
TRAVIS: You put your hand through, and as your
fingers curl around, you do feel a very large

842
00:53:50,709 --> 00:53:58,203
latch, but it is thick and very secure, and it
extends into the mass around it, the wall itself.

843
00:53:58,203 --> 00:54:03,381
You get the impression that it would take quite a
mechanism to unleash this thing.

844
00:54:03,381 --> 00:54:06,183
LAURA: Okay. All right.

845
00:54:06,183 --> 00:54:11,945
SAM: Well, let's go explore. I'm going to walk
around the room. I'm going to walk up the shaft.

846
00:54:11,945 --> 00:54:14,270
TRAVIS: You both head down the hallway?

847
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:15,924
LAURA: I'm going to follow them down the shaft.

848
00:54:15,924 --> 00:54:17,385
SAM: Maybe you left, me right?

849
00:54:17,385 --> 00:54:19,476
TRAVIS: What's the marching order here?

850
00:54:19,476 --> 00:54:23,107
SAM: I'll be to the right of the shaft. He's pants
left.

851
00:54:23,107 --> 00:54:26,283
LIAM: But slowly move up the shaft.

852
00:54:26,283 --> 00:54:28,290
SAM: You don't want to go too fast down the
shaft.

853
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:33,093
TRAVIS: You said to the right of the hallway?
And you're going to be on the left? To the left?

854
00:54:33,265 --> 00:54:34,654
SAM: No, no, he's all the way on the left wall.

855
00:54:34,654 --> 00:54:36,884
TRAVIS: Vax?

856
00:54:36,884 --> 00:54:39,338
LIAM: I will follow behind Scan-Man.

857
00:54:39,338 --> 00:54:41,641
TRAVIS: Okay. And Vex?

858
00:54:41,641 --> 00:54:47,484
LAURA: Behind Percy. And Trinket's going to stand
next to you, Grog, because he loves you so much.

859
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:51,086
SAM: Just going to really just snug the edges of
the shaft.

860
00:54:51,086 --> 00:54:53,069
LIAM: Yeah, you know, palm the sides as you go.

861
00:54:53,069 --> 00:54:54,628
LAURA: Just move forward, nice and easy.

862
00:54:54,628 --> 00:54:56,491
TRAVIS: Would you like to proceed down the
hallway?

863
00:54:56,491 --> 00:54:57,646
SAM: Yes.

864
00:54:57,646 --> 00:54:59,702
TRAVIS: Okay, so you move forward?

865
00:54:59,702 --> 00:55:01,377
SAM: We do move forward.

866
00:55:01,377 --> 00:55:03,315
TALIESIN: Gently, checking for traps.

867
00:55:03,315 --> 00:55:05,747
SAM: I did not say that.

868
00:55:05,747 --> 00:55:11,265
TRAVIS: Well, as Scanlan is just ahead of you in
your pursuit down the hallway, Scanlan feels his

869
00:55:11,265 --> 00:55:14,251
foot fall on a piece of the floor and it sinks.

870
00:55:14,251 --> 00:55:15,294
LAURA: Oh no.

871
00:55:15,294 --> 00:55:21,147
TRAVIS: You hear a grinding noise that you've
heard before in our adventures, and it's not good.

872
00:55:21,147 --> 00:55:25,009
And instinctually, you look to your right
immediately on the wall, and you notice there are

873
00:55:25,009 --> 00:55:26,410
all these holes in the wall.

874
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:27,684
LAURA: Oh no!

875
00:55:27,684 --> 00:55:32,258
TRAVIS: And sure enough, just as you're looking, a
fucking dart sinks right into your cheek. Just

876
00:55:32,258 --> 00:55:34,344
poof, right into your-- (yelling)!

877
00:55:34,344 --> 00:55:39,726
SAM: (screaming) My cheek, it burns, it burns!

878
00:55:39,726 --> 00:55:42,632
TRAVIS: And just as your hands go up to your face,
another one hits you in the thigh.

879
00:55:42,632 --> 00:55:45,773
LAURA: Back up! Scanlan! Back up!

880
00:55:45,773 --> 00:55:47,787
TRAVIS: As you turn around, one sinks into your
butt cheek.

881
00:55:47,787 --> 00:55:49,858
LIAM: I pull him back!

882
00:55:49,858 --> 00:55:52,903
TRAVIS: Yeah, you pull him back. You take--

883
00:55:52,903 --> 00:55:55,379
LIAM: What if I suck the poison out?

884
00:55:55,379 --> 00:55:57,494
SAM: We don't know if it's poisoned yet.

885
00:55:57,494 --> 00:56:01,058
LIAM: Well, just on principle. Just on principle.

886
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:05,661
TRAVIS: You take 13 points of fucking dart
damage.

887
00:56:05,661 --> 00:56:09,182
LIAM: Is that a lot? Is that all you have?

888
00:56:09,182 --> 00:56:11,778
SAM: I assume not. I assume I'm okay.

889
00:56:11,778 --> 00:56:17,114
TRAVIS: You look at the wound in his cheek, and
the wound in his arm, chest area, they don't seem

890
00:56:17,114 --> 00:56:24,042
so bad, but the one in his butt is starting to
swell a little bit. Kind of bruised and red.

891
00:56:24,042 --> 00:56:25,505
LAURA: Yeah, you should definitely suck the poison
out.

892
00:56:25,505 --> 00:56:28,552
LIAM: I definitely should. Or I could use my
paladin ability--

893
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:34,382
LAURA: No, you should just suck it out.

894
00:56:34,382 --> 00:56:37,063
SAM: I pull down my pants.

895
00:56:37,063 --> 00:56:41,637
TRAVIS: Make a medicine check as you suck on
Scanlan's ass.

896
00:56:41,672 --> 00:56:44,021
LIAM: Okay, I'm feeling lucky, though.

897
00:56:44,021 --> 00:56:46,967
LAURA: Oh no!

898
00:56:46,967 --> 00:56:50,616
LIAM: But it knocked the first die into a higher
number, can I go with that?

899
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:52,079
TALIESIN: That's not how the game works, no.

900
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:53,954
LIAM: We've never played this game before!

901
00:56:53,954 --> 00:57:01,184
TRAVIS: I will make a ruling. Because you are
sucking on Scanlan's ass, you may roll with

902
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:02,136
advantage.

903
00:57:02,136 --> 00:57:08,490
LIAM: Not for the first time. So go again. Look at
what I got! That's a good ass suck right there.

904
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:11,391
SAM: I'll be the judge of that.

905
00:57:11,391 --> 00:57:13,532
LIAM: 19, how did I do?

906
00:57:13,532 --> 00:57:18,079
TRAVIS: Fantastic. You manage to get the right
amount of pressure right on the butt cheek, right?

907
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,398
And you suck all the poison out, and you spit it
out, because you know, if you swallow it, also bad

908
00:57:22,398 --> 00:57:28,274
for you, and you manage to take your head away
just in time as a Scanlan little boop farts out.

909
00:57:28,274 --> 00:57:33,993
LIAM: I wave it away and then I take the
opportunity to do one of these. (blows raspberry)

910
00:57:33,993 --> 00:57:41,567
TRAVIS: Oh man. Yeah, nothing like mom's kisses.
That's nice. Good job. So, you've taken 13 points

911
00:57:41,567 --> 00:57:44,197
of damage, you've pointed it out, I assume, to the
rest of the group.

912
00:57:44,197 --> 00:57:47,752
SAM: There's lots of holes with darts in them,
what, what?

913
00:57:47,752 --> 00:57:54,744
(laughter)

914
00:57:54,744 --> 00:57:55,528
TALIESIN: Oh no.

915
00:57:55,528 --> 00:57:58,597
TRAVIS: Yeah, in this game, if you notice
something, call it out to each other. Because what

916
00:57:58,597 --> 00:58:04,206
one person sees, the other somehow might not see.
And just because you know it at the table, doesn't

917
00:58:04,206 --> 00:58:06,762
mean that you know it in your mind pictures.

918
00:58:06,762 --> 00:58:08,774
LIAM: You just made that up.

919
00:58:08,774 --> 00:58:09,911
TRAVIS: That's how this goes, I promise.

920
00:58:09,911 --> 00:58:11,368
LIAM: Where did you learn this game?

921
00:58:11,368 --> 00:58:15,450
TRAVIS: I was in a tavern, and this long-haired
guy was playing a game at the table, and I thought

922
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:19,816
it was fucking great. And I watched for a while.
Like, hours. I was hooked.

923
00:58:19,816 --> 00:58:23,016
I might go back next week and watch.

924
00:58:23,016 --> 00:58:26,440
SAM: Do you need any kind of subscription to watch
it, or can you--

925
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:29,120
TRAVIS: I'm not sure, actually. That's a great
question.

926
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:32,566
LAURA: So, wait. So you saw darts coming out of
the wall, then?

927
00:58:32,566 --> 00:58:35,692
SAM: Yeah, there's traps. There's lots of traps
down the shaft.

928
00:58:35,692 --> 00:58:38,053
LAURA: Okay, so, you guys, I'll let you go ahead.

929
00:58:38,053 --> 00:58:39,751
TALIESIN: I'm going to carefully examine the
floor.

930
00:58:39,751 --> 00:58:41,529
TRAVIS: So you notice that right here--

931
00:58:41,529 --> 00:58:42,787
SAM: That is a permanent marker.

932
00:58:42,787 --> 00:58:45,668
TRAVIS: It is, I don't give a shit. There is this
area.

933
00:58:45,668 --> 00:58:49,303
SAM: Is that yours?

934
00:58:49,303 --> 00:58:52,869
TALIESIN: Matt's going to get his-- That mat is
permanently scarred.

935
00:58:52,869 --> 00:59:01,014
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't fucking care. Or you have to
build a map with that integrated into it. You

936
00:59:01,014 --> 00:59:04,181
notice that that area of the floor, you step on
it, bad shit happens.

937
00:59:04,181 --> 00:59:06,938
LIAM: Every map has a dick in it, from here to
eternity.

938
00:59:06,938 --> 00:59:11,155
LAURA: So we don't step on that section.

939
00:59:11,155 --> 00:59:14,709
TRAVIS: Well, you haven't gone past it yet. Would
you like to try and cross that area?

940
00:59:14,709 --> 00:59:17,147
LIAM: I will start looking for traps up this
shaft.

941
00:59:17,147 --> 00:59:23,284
TRAVIS: Nice. Be very careful with the shaft.
Okay. If you would like to try and cross over that

942
00:59:23,284 --> 00:59:27,901
area, you all need to make an acrobatic check as
you try and leap over.

943
00:59:27,901 --> 00:59:29,175
LIAM: Jump over that spot.

944
00:59:29,175 --> 00:59:32,183
LAURA: Jump over it! Whoa. 33, Grog.

945
00:59:32,183 --> 00:59:35,142
TRAVIS: That's good.

946
00:59:35,142 --> 00:59:36,089
TALIESIN: 22.

947
00:59:36,089 --> 00:59:37,278
SAM: 17.

948
00:59:37,278 --> 00:59:38,354
TRAVIS: 17.

949
00:59:38,354 --> 00:59:41,889
LIAM: Ooh yes. 36.

950
00:59:41,889 --> 00:59:50,726
TRAVIS: 36. Everyone but Vax manages to leap over,
successfully over, well done. Vax catches his

951
00:59:50,726 --> 00:59:58,201
foot, he's like, (yells) and he falls flat on his
face. And the darts go pew pew pew! Vex, if you

952
00:59:58,201 --> 01:00:03,164
want to turn, you can try and drag your brother,
who has luckily had all the darts go above his

953
01:00:03,164 --> 01:00:06,608
lying, goofy body on the floor, and try to pull
him off the plate.

954
01:00:06,608 --> 01:00:08,553
LAURA: Yes, I would love to try and pull my
brother to safety.

955
01:00:08,553 --> 01:00:12,126
LIAM: I like to evade stuff like this, can I use
some sort of evasion?

956
01:00:12,126 --> 01:00:14,320
TRAVIS: Unfortunately, no. Strength check?

957
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,584
LIAM: I knew this was what this game would be. I
knew it.

958
01:00:16,584 --> 01:00:23,162
LAURA: Yeah, a strength check? Oh gosh. I'm not
very strong, Grog. Ooh! 22!

959
01:00:23,162 --> 01:00:26,521
TRAVIS: That's enough, because Vax doesn't have
very many muscles. So you pull him off the plate,

960
01:00:26,521 --> 01:00:30,506
and he's there, all of you are right there, ready
to go again.

961
01:00:30,506 --> 01:00:35,015
LAURA: What about Trinket? And Grog?

962
01:00:35,015 --> 01:00:43,370
TRAVIS: All right. Yeah, hold on. Look, Grog makes
it over, and then Trinket comes up. Roll a

963
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:45,019
acrobatics check for Trinket.

964
01:00:45,019 --> 01:00:52,395
LIAM: Grog, I didn't see anything hit you, but I
might better just suck poison out of your ass,

965
01:00:52,395 --> 01:00:53,533
just to be sure.

966
01:00:53,533 --> 01:00:54,591
TRAVIS: You know what, save it for later.

967
01:00:54,591 --> 01:00:58,639
LAURA: I'm going to say that's a 14 for Trinket.

968
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:00,886
TRAVIS: Ooh, yeah, so unfortunately--

969
01:01:00,886 --> 01:01:02,873
LAURA: Grog, save him as he falls!

970
01:01:04,023 --> 01:01:08,168
TRAVIS: Sure. So he falls and I start to hear the
grinding again and I pull him by his ear, and

971
01:01:08,168 --> 01:01:13,654
whoop, everybody's on the safe side of the trap.

972
01:01:13,654 --> 01:01:15,429
What would you like to do next?

973
01:01:15,627 --> 01:01:18,441
LIAM: I would like to see if there are any more
traps before we get to the tip.

974
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:20,274
TRAVIS: Roll a perception check.

975
01:01:20,274 --> 01:01:25,608
LIAM: Perception, which one is this? There's a
picture of a monk on this one.

976
01:01:25,608 --> 01:01:30,255
LIAM: Dungeons and Flagons! Perception? 22.

977
01:01:30,255 --> 01:01:37,595
TRAVIS: 22? Yes, indeed. There are no further
traps towards the tip, but your keen half-elf ears

978
01:01:37,595 --> 01:01:43,555
pick up a (wind blowing) sound.

979
01:01:43,555 --> 01:01:45,514
LAURA: Does it sound like ghosts that we have
encountered?

980
01:01:45,514 --> 01:01:55,069
TRAVIS: "Turn back." And you spin on your heel,
and outside of Grog's amazing deltoids, which

981
01:01:55,069 --> 01:02:02,722
look swollen from shoulder day, you see behind
you a spectral form starting to make its way

982
01:02:02,722 --> 01:02:03,586
towards you.

983
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:05,096
LAURA: Oh no.

984
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:08,233
SAM: It's a ghost of some sort, holding a shovel.

985
01:02:08,233 --> 01:02:12,739
TRAVIS: I need you all to roll initiative.

986
01:02:12,739 --> 01:02:13,862
LIAM: What?

987
01:02:13,862 --> 01:02:14,678
TALIESIN: Initiative.

988
01:02:15,037 --> 01:02:16,772
LIAM: What's initiative?

989
01:02:16,772 --> 01:02:17,780
TALIESIN: What we're rolling.

990
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:19,736
LIAM: That's a die, you're rolling a die.

991
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,580
TALIESIN: Yes. You roll your initiative die.

992
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:24,596
LIAM: I had so many ghosts in that box over there,
Travis.

993
01:02:24,596 --> 01:02:26,051
TRAVIS: I already bought that one.

994
01:02:26,051 --> 01:02:33,608
LIAM: I brought six tubs of miniatures. So many
miniatures.

995
01:02:33,608 --> 01:02:35,489
SAM: You bought that ghost with a shovel already?

996
01:02:35,489 --> 01:02:39,141
TRAVIS: Yeah. It was two dollars or
something.

997
01:02:39,141 --> 01:02:42,549
SAM: Why is he holding a shovel?

998
01:02:42,549 --> 01:02:43,506
LAURA: 24.

999
01:02:43,506 --> 01:02:46,429
LIAM: 16.

1000
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:49,108
TRAVIS: 16. Percy.

1001
01:02:49,108 --> 01:02:50,137
TALIESIN: 16.

1002
01:02:50,137 --> 01:02:52,524
TRAVIS: Wow. 16, Percy. Really?

1003
01:02:52,524 --> 01:02:54,638
TALIESIN: 16. I rolled very poorly.

1004
01:02:54,638 --> 01:02:56,103
SAM: 14.

1005
01:02:56,103 --> 01:03:02,417
TRAVIS: Vex, you're up first. You see the
spectral form starting to move towards you.

1006
01:03:02,417 --> 01:03:04,255
What would you like to do?

1007
01:03:04,255 --> 01:03:06,081
LAURA: Oh, I'm going to shoot an arrow at it.

1008
01:03:06,081 --> 01:03:07,028
TRAVIS: You shoot an arrow at it?

1009
01:03:07,028 --> 01:03:08,824
LAURA: From a blazing bowstring, because why not?

1010
01:03:08,824 --> 01:03:11,393
TRAVIS: Okay. Roll to hit.

1011
01:03:11,393 --> 01:03:14,324
LAURA: 25?

1012
01:03:14,324 --> 01:03:16,384
TRAVIS: Hold on! Wait. There's music and shit.
Fuck.

1013
01:03:16,384 --> 01:03:20,265
SAM: Shall I tell the unseen servants to change
the music?

1014
01:03:20,265 --> 01:03:21,544
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1015
01:03:21,544 --> 01:03:23,634
SAM: Play something more rousing, please. 
Thank you.

1016
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:25,450
LIAM: What, what?

1017
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:29,758
SAM: I'm not in character now.
I'm just Scanlan.

1018
01:03:29,761 --> 01:03:31,295
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, what was it?

1019
01:03:31,295 --> 01:03:33,659
LAURA: Shit. 25.

1020
01:03:33,659 --> 01:03:35,960
TRAVIS: Hit. Yeah, that definitely hits.

1021
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:45,002
LAURA: Okay. Oh jeez. I'm going to decide what I
should, you know, attack should-- Sure. Ten.

1022
01:03:45,002 --> 01:03:49,498
Plus-- Oh, I didn't Hunter's Mark him 
because I'm stupid.

1023
01:03:49,498 --> 01:03:51,371
TRAVIS: Yeah, too late for that.

1024
01:03:51,371 --> 01:03:56,116
LAURA: 15 plus fire. 15 plus eight is 23.

1025
01:03:56,116 --> 01:03:58,422
TRAVIS: 23, nice.

1026
01:03:58,422 --> 01:04:02,922
LIAM: Look at Grog on that board, looks like he's
staring and judging the toys.

1027
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:06,756
LAURA: And then for my bonus action--

1028
01:04:06,756 --> 01:04:08,135
LIAM: A what?

1029
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:13,803
LAURA: Can I have Trinket jump across the thing
that he just crossed and attack the ghost, too?

1030
01:04:13,803 --> 01:04:16,255
TRAVIS: Yeah, roll an acrobatic check first.

1031
01:04:16,255 --> 01:04:19,423
LAURA: Although I don't think I can actually have
him attack after I shot an arrow.

1032
01:04:19,423 --> 01:04:21,175
TRAVIS: Oh, then no--

1033
01:04:21,175 --> 01:04:24,021
LAURA: Yes, I can! Because I only
attacked once, that's how it works.

1034
01:04:24,021 --> 01:04:28,314
LIAM: Bonus action? This is what all those ballet
classes for Trinket were for, right now.

1035
01:04:28,314 --> 01:04:30,289
LAURA: That's an 11 for him.

1036
01:04:30,577 --> 01:04:32,795
TRAVIS: For the acrobatic check?

1037
01:04:32,795 --> 01:04:41,624
Trinket falls right on the plate. And he's like, 
boom. And then, because it shot all those darts,

1038
01:04:41,624 --> 01:04:45,214
and Vax fell, and they were like, "Oh, none 
of the darts hit," they're all aimed down.

1039
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:52,303
And Trinket takes like six darts.
He looks like the guy in The Godfather

1040
01:04:52,303 --> 01:04:57,094
He's like, (distressed bear sounds, darts)
covered in darts. Trinket takes--

1041
01:04:57,094 --> 01:05:04,015
SAM: Don't worry, Vex, it's not Real-Trinket, it's
Imagination-Trinket. Real-Trinket is still alive.

1042
01:05:04,015 --> 01:05:05,915
TRAVIS: 24 points of damage.

1043
01:05:05,915 --> 01:05:08,915
LAURA: That's a lot.

1044
01:05:08,915 --> 01:05:13,207
TRAVIS: But he manages with his bear strength 
to pull himself just out of the line of fire.

1045
01:05:13,207 --> 01:05:15,068
But he is right there.

1046
01:05:15,068 --> 01:05:18,925
LAURA: Can he continue his attack? 
Probably not. Can I attack with my second arrow?

1047
01:05:18,925 --> 01:05:22,911
TRAVIS: No. Vax, you're up.

1048
01:05:22,911 --> 01:05:28,991
LIAM: I will run at the ghost. Right?
Because I have to get up to it.

1049
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:33,001
I could throw, but where's the fun in that? 
So I run at the ghost,

1050
01:05:33,001 --> 01:05:38,258
and I'm going to use Whisper,
and I'm going to dagger, dagger, dagger.

1051
01:05:38,258 --> 01:05:43,290
And I'm going to use the power of my deity
and do something called Divine Smiting.

1052
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:46,382
I've never told you guys what it's called,
but it's called Divine Smite.

1053
01:05:46,382 --> 01:05:49,834
TRAVIS: Well, give me an acrobatics check, 
because you jump over the plate area.

1054
01:05:49,834 --> 01:05:52,445
You want to run into melee with the ghost?

1055
01:05:52,445 --> 01:05:56,873
LIAM: Yeah. So that's 33.

1056
01:05:56,873 --> 01:05:59,451
TRAVIS: You learn from your previous errors
and man up,

1057
01:05:59,451 --> 01:06:01,581
and you totally make it across just fine.

1058
01:06:01,581 --> 01:06:06,703
LIAM: Yeah, I rolled lower than the last time.
Great. I jump across, run.

1059
01:06:06,703 --> 01:06:08,900
How do I hit it with my knife?

1060
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,120
TRAVIS: You stab it.

1061
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:13,577
LIAM: Okay.

1062
01:06:13,577 --> 01:06:15,067
TRAVIS: Roll to attack.

1063
01:06:15,067 --> 01:06:18,066
LIAM: Okay, so I roll once. I'm going to use my--

1064
01:06:18,066 --> 01:06:20,113
LAURA: Your second luck of the day.

1065
01:06:20,113 --> 01:06:26,607
LIAM: I have endless luck. It's endless. 
That's a one. So instead I get a 19.

1066
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:29,236
TRAVIS: A 19. Which hits.

1067
01:06:29,236 --> 01:06:35,602
LIAM: It does? Oh my gosh. God, there's
all these numbers on this piece of paper.

1068
01:06:35,602 --> 01:06:37,125
LAURA: You've used two of them.

1069
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:46,433
LIAM: I've used 17 lucks. It was a six. I'm not
very good at math; I copied all of her answers.

1070
01:06:46,433 --> 01:06:51,295
I think that's around 13, plus eight, 21, 
and then the Divine Smite,

1071
01:06:51,462 --> 01:06:56,958
which I'm going to peg somewhere around 3d8. 
So a 31. That'll do.

1072
01:06:56,958 --> 01:07:03,281
38. That was a 42. 44. 
Grog, 44 points of damage.

1073
01:07:03,281 --> 01:07:06,039
TRAVIS: Boy, that's a lot of damage 
with that Divine Smite.

1074
01:07:06,039 --> 01:07:09,009
LIAM: Feathers everywhere, David Bowie-style. 
Does it hurt the ghost?

1075
01:07:09,009 --> 01:07:14,855
TRAVIS: Boy, it really does. You see him go like,
"Ouch!" And his form shivers and stuff,

1076
01:07:14,855 --> 01:07:18,890
and he's like (pained sounds).
You see the area where you stab evaporates

1077
01:07:18,890 --> 01:07:22,584
and then comes back into form, 
but he's still standing there

1078
01:07:22,584 --> 01:07:26,685
He gleams at you 
with these fucking dead ghost eyes.

1079
01:07:26,727 --> 01:07:33,672
LAURA: Is he a dwarf ghost? Because he seems
rather short. He is a dwarf ghost?

1080
01:07:33,672 --> 01:07:36,405
TRAVIS: Yep. Yeah. He is a dwarf ghost.

1081
01:07:36,405 --> 01:07:40,346
LIAM: But I can attack so many times, Grog. 
Can I do another quickie?

1082
01:07:40,346 --> 01:07:41,997
LAURA: I only got one arrow. 
You only get one dagger.

1083
01:07:41,997 --> 01:07:44,084
TRAVIS: That's fair. 
That sounds like a good idea.

1084
01:07:44,084 --> 01:07:45,373
LIAM: Is that how it works?

1085
01:07:45,373 --> 01:07:48,210
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's how it works.

1086
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:53,580
He turns to you after being like, 
"It hurts so bad." You really hurt him really bad.

1087
01:07:54,406 --> 01:07:58,223
And he is going to use Horrifying Visage on you.

1088
01:07:58,223 --> 01:07:59,769
LIAM: What the fuck is that?

1089
01:07:59,769 --> 01:08:02,066
TRAVIS: Yeah, I need you to make a wisdom saving
throw.

1090
01:08:02,066 --> 01:08:15,394
LIAM: A wisdom saving throw? Okay, so I don't have
any of that. Oh, that's good. I rolled an 18.

1091
01:08:15,394 --> 01:08:20,657
TRAVIS: Oh, that succeeds. You see him almost
glare into your soul, you feel your little

1092
01:08:20,657 --> 01:08:25,543
butthole pucker, and you're like, "Oh no, it's so
scary!" but you shake it off because you've seen

1093
01:08:25,543 --> 01:08:30,330
so much worse in your time. Yeah. And you throw up
the double-birds, and he's like (hissing), and you

1094
01:08:30,330 --> 01:08:33,777
shake it off. That's good.
Percy, it's your turn.

1095
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:37,736
TALIESIN: Yes. Well, I'm going to back up 
and take a shot at this--

1096
01:08:37,736 --> 01:08:39,398
TRAVIS: Back away from the ghost, or towards him?

1097
01:08:39,398 --> 01:08:42,511
TALIESIN: No, away from the ghost. Away from the
ghost a bit, and I'm going to take a shot.

1098
01:08:42,511 --> 01:08:47,905
I'll just take one, since it seems we're being
sporting about it. So I'm going to use my magical

1099
01:08:47,905 --> 01:08:58,216
psychic shot. And that's not bad. That's a 24.

1100
01:08:58,216 --> 01:08:59,801
TRAVIS: 24 hits.

1101
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:06,769
TALIESIN: All right. Well then, I'm going to do
that, plus this. And I'm also going to hit him

1102
01:09:06,769 --> 01:09:08,695
with a bit of electricity, as well.

1103
01:09:08,695 --> 01:09:09,717
TRAVIS: Yeah, do it.

1104
01:09:09,717 --> 01:09:17,177
TALIESIN: Ooh, that's lovely. That's
ten points of damage, plus six points

1105
01:09:17,177 --> 01:09:20,200
of psychic damage, 
plus four points of electricity.

1106
01:09:20,221 --> 01:09:26,196
TRAVIS: That is just enough. You hit him, and his
form-- You hear this shriek, and he just--

1107
01:09:26,196 --> 01:09:37,510
turns into a puff of smoke. 
Disappears into nowhere, and the ghost is gone.

1108
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:40,127
Calm retakes the hallway.

1109
01:09:40,127 --> 01:09:41,854
LAURA: Back towards the tip.

1110
01:09:41,854 --> 01:09:44,551
SAM: Yes, musicians, calm down.

1111
01:09:44,551 --> 01:09:46,978
LIAM: Let's refocus on the shaft.

1112
01:09:46,978 --> 01:09:52,859
TALIESIN: I'm going to peruse the rest of the--

1113
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:56,119
TRAVIS: Make a perception check to explore the
hallway.

1114
01:09:56,119 --> 01:09:58,918
LIAM: Just the tip, though, Percy.

1115
01:09:58,918 --> 01:10:06,594
TALIESIN: If I get too close to the tip, I might
experience a burning sensation from the torch. 20.

1116
01:10:06,594 --> 01:10:14,910
TRAVIS: 20, yeah, that's great. You move forward,
and you see no doorways, no exits, but you do see

1117
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:23,700
a line near the end of the hallway that seems to
be a bit of an inequality in the rocks. Almost

1118
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:26,762
like if you push on it, something might happen.

1119
01:10:26,762 --> 01:10:30,569
LAURA: Maybe you should push on it, Percy?

1120
01:10:30,569 --> 01:10:32,811
LIAM: We should backtrack the way we came.

1121
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:36,043
TALIESIN: Really? All right, I'm pushing on it.

1122
01:10:36,043 --> 01:10:39,748
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, you push on it.
Give me a strength check.

1123
01:10:39,748 --> 01:10:41,239
TALIESIN: Oh, this will go well.

1124
01:10:41,239 --> 01:10:42,844
LIAM: Push it real good.

1125
01:10:42,844 --> 01:10:49,400
TALIESIN: Pushing. Push it. Oh no. 
That would be a--

1126
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,325
LIAM: That's the lowest number 
you can get on that thing.

1127
01:10:51,325 --> 01:10:53,691
TALIESIN: That is indeed the lowest number 
you can get.

1128
01:10:53,691 --> 01:10:57,402
TRAVIS: Right. Strangely, you lean into it, about
to give it a big shove, but your feet slip out

1129
01:10:57,402 --> 01:11:00,911
from under you on the slick rock. 
And you fall flat on your face, and you bite

1130
01:11:00,911 --> 01:11:03,163
a bit of your tongue and lip.

1131
01:11:03,163 --> 01:11:07,203
TALIESIN: (lisping) I could use some assistance 
with this. Please.

1132
01:11:07,203 --> 01:11:09,792
SAM: I'll show you how it's done.

1133
01:11:09,792 --> 01:11:17,416
Scanlan, in real life, is not a very strong
person, but I'm playing my character

1134
01:11:17,416 --> 01:11:22,639
as very strong, so Scanlan runs in 
and pushes hard on the wall.

1135
01:11:22,639 --> 01:11:25,612
TRAVIS: Great, yeah, make a strength check.

1136
01:11:25,612 --> 01:11:30,824
SAM: Ooh. 16.

1137
01:11:30,824 --> 01:11:35,748
TRAVIS: 16. You lean in and you push, having
Percy, just like little bloody mouth right next to

1138
01:11:35,748 --> 01:11:42,008
you, and sure enough, the wall starts to move, but
you can see light coming from the other side. It's

1139
01:11:42,008 --> 01:11:44,765
just too heavy for you to move.

1140
01:11:44,765 --> 01:11:47,259
SAM: I need some help over here!

1141
01:11:47,259 --> 01:11:50,796
LAURA: Trinket's going to run over. 
Damn it, he has to cross the thingy again.

1142
01:11:50,796 --> 01:11:52,903
TALIESIN: He's going to have to cross the thingy
again.

1143
01:11:52,903 --> 01:11:58,037
TRAVIS: "You know what, I got it." Grog goes up
towards the end of the hallway.

1144
01:11:58,037 --> 01:12:02,143
He's like, "Maybe I'll just fucking handle
this, you guys, don't worry."

1145
01:12:02,143 --> 01:12:12,181
And he rolls a million, and the door flies open. 
Almost comes off whatever invisible hinges it had.

1146
01:12:12,181 --> 01:12:14,330
Like, rock falls out of the door.

1147
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,027
LIAM: Just like life.

1148
01:12:16,027 --> 01:12:20,965
TRAVIS: Yeah. Pretty much. I know. Doors can't
faze me. The rest of you, it's a problem.

1149
01:12:20,965 --> 01:12:27,975
Not always true. You see before you a lit cavern.
Something off in the distance, but you're still

1150
01:12:27,975 --> 01:12:29,953
in the doorway. What do you do?

1151
01:12:29,953 --> 01:12:32,297
SAM: A lit cabin?

1152
01:12:32,297 --> 01:12:33,937
TRAVIS, LIAM, and TALIESIN: Cavern.

1153
01:12:33,937 --> 01:12:38,273
LAURA: I'm going to shoot another oracle arrow
into the lit cavern.

1154
01:12:38,273 --> 01:12:40,492
TRAVIS: Do you have another oracle arrow?

1155
01:12:40,492 --> 01:12:41,990
LAURA: I do, I have one more.

1156
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:45,015
TRAVIS: Yeah? Roll to attack. Shoot.

1157
01:12:45,015 --> 01:12:46,770
LAURA: 26.

1158
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:51,833
TRAVIS: You nock, and you pull, and you release,
and your vision goes into the arrow, and it shoots

1159
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:58,286
forward. You see stone floors beneath you, and all
of a sudden, it shoots past what looks like a

1160
01:12:58,286 --> 01:13:03,681
flowing fountain of water, and it just arcs past,
and you see as it clears past the fountain, a

1161
01:13:03,681 --> 01:13:10,273
small, furry shape on the ground, and it hits into
a ground, and it scatters, and the arrow shatters

1162
01:13:10,273 --> 01:13:11,802
on the floor.

1163
01:13:11,802 --> 01:13:17,918
LAURA: There's a furry shape! There's an animal in
there. Let's go in! I walk into the room.

1164
01:13:17,918 --> 01:13:25,392
TRAVIS: Okay. So. Would you all like to follow
her? You all want to go?

1165
01:13:25,392 --> 01:13:28,495
LIAM: I'm going to hang back at the tip of the
wang there.

1166
01:13:28,495 --> 01:13:30,577
TRAVIS: Vax hangs back.

1167
01:13:30,577 --> 01:13:35,206
LAURA: Oh no, we all fell over.

1168
01:13:35,206 --> 01:13:41,639
TRAVIS: You all fell over. There you go. So you
see this fountain right here.

1169
01:13:41,639 --> 01:13:49,232
LAURA: Jesus H. That's lovely, Grog.

1170
01:13:49,232 --> 01:13:56,244
TRAVIS: Scanlan right here, and Vax over here.

1171
01:13:56,244 --> 01:14:03,454
LIAM: Yeah. I don't want to leave. I don't want to
go. I feel safe in the shaft.

1172
01:14:03,454 --> 01:14:08,742
TRAVIS: There's a fountain right in front of you,
and as you go in, you see there appears to be

1173
01:14:08,742 --> 01:14:17,063
like, just this rouge, flushed-skin type water
coming out of it. Some sort of fluid. And it's

1174
01:14:17,063 --> 01:14:21,911
just a beautiful fountain, right in the middle of
the room. Circular, from what you can see.

1175
01:14:21,911 --> 01:14:22,746
What do you do?

1176
01:14:22,746 --> 01:14:24,776
LAURA: Where was the furry creature?

1177
01:14:24,776 --> 01:14:27,059
TRAVIS: It was past the fountain somewhere, you're
not sure.

1178
01:14:27,059 --> 01:14:30,595
LAURA: I'm going to look at the ground and see if
there's any traps.

1179
01:14:30,595 --> 01:14:35,967
TRAVIS: Traps? Do a perception check. Is that what
you're doing for traps?

1180
01:14:35,967 --> 01:14:37,141
SAM: I think it's investigation.

1181
01:14:37,141 --> 01:14:38,939
TRAVIS: Okay, do roll an investigation check.

1182
01:14:38,939 --> 01:14:39,959
LAURA: 12.

1183
01:14:39,959 --> 01:14:43,882
TRAVIS: 12. There do not appear to be any traps.

1184
01:14:43,882 --> 01:14:49,927
LAURA: Great. Then I walk forward towards the
fountain. And past it.

1185
01:14:49,927 --> 01:14:54,941
SAM: I will stick with her. So I can protect her.

1186
01:14:54,941 --> 01:14:56,860
LAURA: Thank you, Scanlan.

1187
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:59,136
TALIESIN: You're not doing the voice anymore?

1188
01:14:59,136 --> 01:15:01,572
SAM: That's only when I in-character talk to
someone else.

1189
01:15:01,572 --> 01:15:04,180
TALIESIN: Oh, so this is the narrative. The
narrative voice is different.

1190
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:12,119
TRAVIS: You see before you what looks like a dog.

1191
01:15:12,119 --> 01:15:18,351
A tiny little dog. Where is the dog? 
Where's the dog gone?

1192
01:15:18,355 --> 01:15:21,219
Right about here, at the edge of your vision.

1193
01:15:21,219 --> 01:15:23,657
TALIESIN: Is the dog over there? By Bigby's Hand?

1194
01:15:23,657 --> 01:15:25,488
LAURA: Do you want this to be a dog?

1195
01:15:25,488 --> 01:15:28,376
TRAVIS: Sure, yeah, we'll use this to be a dog.
Here's the dog right here.

1196
01:15:28,446 --> 01:15:29,782
SAM: Did you buy a dog?

1197
01:15:29,782 --> 01:15:31,473
TRAVIS: No, it's one of Liam's. 
It was in the box.

1198
01:15:31,473 --> 01:15:35,544
LIAM: Eight tubs of minis. Eight tubs of minis.
There's a die on the map.

1199
01:15:35,544 --> 01:15:39,730
TRAVIS: You see a dog, his tail just sweeping
behind him.

1200
01:15:39,730 --> 01:15:42,721
LAURA: Grog, can I cast Speak With Animals?

1201
01:15:42,721 --> 01:15:44,851
TRAVIS: If you'd like to.

1202
01:15:44,851 --> 01:15:47,111
LAURA: I want to. And I want to talk to him.

1203
01:15:47,111 --> 01:15:48,563
TRAVIS: Go for it.

1204
01:15:48,563 --> 01:15:53,923
LAURA: I want to say: Hey, dog. What are you doing
down here?

1205
01:15:53,923 --> 01:16:01,010
TRAVIS: As you do that, the dog whips around 
and looks at you, jumps to its feet

1206
01:16:01,016 --> 01:16:02,806
and starts to growl.

1207
01:16:03,159 --> 01:16:08,987
Starts to growl and he's like "Intruder.
Intruder!" You see as these bone shards

1208
01:16:08,987 --> 01:16:13,489
start to protrude from his back and shoulders. 
His spine starts to lengthen,

1209
01:16:13,489 --> 01:16:19,800
and he's no longer a fucking dice dog. 
It is this massive thing.

1210
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,263
SAM: Some sort of demon dog.

1211
01:16:21,263 --> 01:16:23,753
LAURA: Oh shit. I immediately shoot an arrow at
him.

1212
01:16:23,753 --> 01:16:25,098
TRAVIS: You do?

1213
01:16:25,098 --> 01:16:27,242
LAURA: But I want to Hunter's Mark him first.

1214
01:16:27,242 --> 01:16:29,174
TRAVIS: Roll to attack.

1215
01:16:29,174 --> 01:16:31,715
SAM: Doesn't she have to step back to shoot an
arrow?

1216
01:16:31,715 --> 01:16:33,128
LAURA: I'm not right on him.

1217
01:16:33,128 --> 01:16:35,401
LIAM: You're at disadvantage if you're right up
against.

1218
01:16:35,401 --> 01:16:37,464
LAURA: But I'm not right up against him.

1219
01:16:37,464 --> 01:16:39,250
SAM: Well, ask the Bunion Master.

1220
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:41,116
LIAM: I mean, I just feel like that's a rule.

1221
01:16:41,366 --> 01:16:43,642
TRAVIS: You're at disadvantage because you're so
close.

1222
01:16:43,642 --> 01:16:45,451
SAM: Thank you, Grog. Thank you.

1223
01:16:45,451 --> 01:16:48,538
LAURA: Fucking dick, Scanlan. Fine. 26.

1224
01:16:48,538 --> 01:16:54,520
TRAVIS: 26. You hit the vicious hell hound. What's
your damage?

1225
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,774
LAURA: Oh, okay.

1226
01:16:56,774 --> 01:17:04,648
LIAM: Must be like a rottweiler or something then
because they're so mean. Not really. That's just a

1227
01:17:04,648 --> 01:17:05,591
myth, isn't it?

1228
01:17:05,591 --> 01:17:10,106
TALIESIN: I think it's just a myth. Although I had
a neighbor with a chihuahua once.

1229
01:17:10,106 --> 01:17:11,778
LIAM: Maybe a chihuahua. It's probably a
chihuahua.

1230
01:17:11,778 --> 01:17:13,117
TALIESIN: They're all bite-y.

1231
01:17:13,117 --> 01:17:17,898
LAURA: That's 16 plus six is 22 plus six is 28.

1232
01:17:17,898 --> 01:17:25,689
TRAVIS: 28 points of damage with one shot.
Amazing. Great. Is that the end of your turn?

1233
01:17:25,689 --> 01:17:28,177
LAURA: I want Trinket to run up and attack him
too.

1234
01:17:28,177 --> 01:17:29,119
TRAVIS: Okay.

1235
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:30,975
LAURA: He does, right?

1236
01:17:30,975 --> 01:17:32,706
TRAVIS: Trinket runs up around the other side.

1237
01:17:32,706 --> 01:17:34,469
LAURA: Oh he got a natural 20!

1238
01:17:34,469 --> 01:17:35,567
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

1239
01:17:35,567 --> 01:17:37,241
TALIESIN: That means something.

1240
01:17:37,241 --> 01:17:43,553
TRAVIS: If you can't tell from her exuberance, a
natural 20 is like the best thing you can roll.

1241
01:17:43,553 --> 01:17:44,806
LAURA: That's really good.

1242
01:17:44,806 --> 01:17:46,825
LIAM: Have you played this with him before you
played with us?

1243
01:17:46,825 --> 01:17:49,727
LAURA: So I happened to be in the same tavern that
he was in.

1244
01:17:49,727 --> 01:17:54,042
SAM: Yeah, we all were Vax. Sorry, we didn't want
to tell you but we were all there, that's why we

1245
01:17:54,042 --> 01:17:55,213
know how to play the game so well.

1246
01:17:55,213 --> 01:18:01,132
LIAM: Why didn't you let me sleep in with Keyleth
then? Why am I here? Jeez.

1247
01:18:01,132 --> 01:18:03,413
SAM: It's such a good game that we all wanted to
play and share it with you.

1248
01:18:03,413 --> 01:18:05,140
LAURA: I thought you would really like it.

1249
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:07,504
LIAM: I want to fucking sleep in for once.

1250
01:18:07,504 --> 01:18:09,660
SAM: But we also knew that we would probably win
because you don't know how to play.

1251
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:11,069
LAURA: Trinket attacks him.

1252
01:18:11,069 --> 01:18:12,985
TRAVIS: Okay great. And what's the damage?

1253
01:18:12,985 --> 01:18:14,036
LAURA: Oh, I don't know.

1254
01:18:14,036 --> 01:18:16,374
TALIESIN: This has never happened before.

1255
01:18:16,374 --> 01:18:17,802
LAURA: I know, he doesn't do this very often.

1256
01:18:17,802 --> 01:18:19,112
TRAVIS: He critted.

1257
01:18:19,112 --> 01:18:30,355
LAURA: He did. Ah! Okay, so 2d4 plus nine. Because
it's a claw attack.

1258
01:18:30,355 --> 01:18:31,808
TRAVIS: Okay.

1259
01:18:31,808 --> 01:18:35,590
LAURA: Okay. Where's my other-- there it is.

1260
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:40,706
TRAVIS: There's fucking mysterious music. Have the
people change it to some sort of--

1261
01:18:40,706 --> 01:18:42,727
SAM: Oh sorry, change the music again please.

1262
01:18:42,727 --> 01:18:44,393
TALIESIN: Switch tracks, my friend.

1263
01:18:44,393 --> 01:18:47,856
LIAM: Is it like the ghost piano at the Magic
Castle?

1264
01:18:47,856 --> 01:18:49,771
LAURA: 23!

1265
01:18:49,771 --> 01:18:53,024
TRAVIS: Whoa, 23. Trinket putting out some
damage.

1266
01:18:53,024 --> 01:18:54,474
LAURA: I mean that's pretty great, right?

1267
01:18:54,474 --> 01:18:55,521
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's pretty good.

1268
01:18:55,521 --> 01:18:58,340
LAURA: I should have had him do that before me, I
could have gotten sneak attack damage.

1269
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:03,484
TRAVIS: Yeah, seriously. Okay so, as Trinket
attacks and takes a vicious chunk out of the side

1270
01:19:03,484 --> 01:19:04,739
of this hell hound right--

1271
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:05,771
LAURA: With his claws!

1272
01:19:05,771 --> 01:19:08,692
TRAVIS: You hear a growl even further into the
cavern.

1273
01:19:08,692 --> 01:19:10,676
LAURA and TALIESIN: Oh no.

1274
01:19:10,676 --> 01:19:14,153
LIAM: How far does this go? Oh look, isn't that
clever!

1275
01:19:14,153 --> 01:19:19,206
LAURA: Oh it's boobies. I thought it was an anus.

1276
01:19:19,206 --> 01:19:20,437
LIAM: It's tits.

1277
01:19:20,437 --> 01:19:21,752
LAURA: I thought it was an anus.

1278
01:19:21,752 --> 01:19:23,002
SAM: No, that's just the shape of the cavern.

1279
01:19:23,002 --> 01:19:24,080
TRAVIS: No, these are caverns.

1280
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,042
SAM: Yeah.

1281
01:19:25,042 --> 01:19:26,153
LIAM: Caverns.

1282
01:19:26,153 --> 01:19:31,702
TRAVIS: What are you smoking? And you see from
behind the fountain coming another hell hound to

1283
01:19:31,702 --> 01:19:34,635
see what the cry of its fallen brethren are.

1284
01:19:34,635 --> 01:19:38,721
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a run at the first one
and I'm going to throw my spear.

1285
01:19:38,721 --> 01:19:40,913
TRAVIS: You're going to throw your spear?

1286
01:19:40,913 --> 01:19:42,581
SAM: The spear that you picked up at the tavern?

1287
01:19:42,581 --> 01:19:45,397
TALIESIN: I am. I pick up that tavern spear and
I'm going to throw it.

1288
01:19:45,397 --> 01:19:49,348
TRAVIS: Actually, now the other ones as well, I
need you to roll initiative again.

1289
01:19:49,348 --> 01:19:52,207
LIAM: Okay we're doing it again, let's roll one of
these little balls.

1290
01:19:52,207 --> 01:19:53,154
SAM: 18.

1291
01:19:53,154 --> 01:19:55,136
TALIESIN: 16 yet again.

1292
01:19:55,136 --> 01:19:58,274
LAURA: 14.

1293
01:19:58,274 --> 01:20:00,261
LIAM: 21.

1294
01:20:00,261 --> 01:20:06,228
TRAVIS: 21. Vax, you, back near the tip, are up.

1295
01:20:06,228 --> 01:20:10,253
LIAM: Okay, I click my boots. Do I have my boots?

1296
01:20:10,253 --> 01:20:12,425
TRAVIS: Do you normally have your boots?

1297
01:20:12,425 --> 01:20:13,196
LIAM: Always.

1298
01:20:13,196 --> 01:20:14,144
TRAVIS: Then you do.

1299
01:20:14,144 --> 01:20:19,898
LIAM: Fuck yeah! I click the boots, and I bolt
through, out the end of the penis and to the

1300
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:22,813
boobs, or the egg, or whatever it is. I go from
the tunnel--

1301
01:20:22,813 --> 01:20:23,996
TRAVIS: The hallway.

1302
01:20:23,996 --> 01:20:29,420
LIAM: Yeah, the hallway into the cavern. The first
round cavern that is identical to the next one.

1303
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:34,290
TRAVIS: Strange words coming out of your mouth.
You come into the cavern.

1304
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:42,677
LIAM: Painful stuff. Yeah, I'd like to run around
between my sister and Trinket and get up into the

1305
01:20:42,677 --> 01:20:47,697
grill of that first spiky dog, because I should
have a better chance of hitting it because it's so

1306
01:20:47,697 --> 01:20:49,554
preoccupied with my sister.

1307
01:20:49,554 --> 01:20:52,957
TRAVIS: Move your little character wherever you'd
like to go, yeah.

1308
01:20:52,957 --> 01:20:58,315
LIAM: Jeez. So I jump over here. So I bang like that,
I can jump over Grog, and I go (whoop), right up

1309
01:20:58,315 --> 01:21:00,682
in the middle like that. And then I stab.

1310
01:21:00,682 --> 01:21:02,459
TRAVIS: You stab. Roll to attack.

1311
01:21:02,459 --> 01:21:06,652
LIAM: I'm going to roll twice. Because I'm feeling
good. Ooh, that's good. 30.

1312
01:21:06,652 --> 01:21:07,919
TRAVIS: That hits.

1313
01:21:07,919 --> 01:21:15,657
LIAM: Oh, it does. Okay. So I roll this pointy one
that's like a caltrop, and that's a two. And then

1314
01:21:15,657 --> 01:21:21,068
I add eight to that, that's a ten. And then I roll
again for psychic damage. That's 12. Look at all

1315
01:21:21,068 --> 01:21:32,195
these in a box, oh my God, look at that. 14,
eight, no. 25. 29. 32. 32, Grog.

1316
01:21:32,195 --> 01:21:36,588
TRAVIS: With that first dagger, you sink it into
the side of the hell hound, and you hear a (pained squeal),

1317
01:21:36,588 --> 01:21:42,763
and he recoils from the pain, and all of
a sudden, his flesh and fur just turns into flame,

1318
01:21:42,763 --> 01:21:47,878
and he catches fire and burns into nothing. He
just absolutely disintegrates.

1319
01:21:47,878 --> 01:21:50,562
LAURA: Does that hurt Trinket standing right next
to him?

1320
01:21:50,562 --> 01:21:51,563
TRAVIS: No, it doesn't.

1321
01:21:51,563 --> 01:21:54,852
LIAM: And then we all only get one attack per
turn, is that right?

1322
01:21:54,852 --> 01:21:55,953
LAURA: Yeah.

1323
01:21:55,953 --> 01:21:58,202
TRAVIS: Well, don't you have more attacks?
Normally I see you do a lot of shit.

1324
01:21:58,202 --> 01:22:03,086
LIAM: I do, but before-- Yes. I have four more.
Five more, seven more attacks.

1325
01:22:03,086 --> 01:22:05,065
TRAVIS: How about one more attack? Sounds good.

1326
01:22:05,065 --> 01:22:07,960
LIAM: One more attack is good. It might be more,
but we'll just do one more.

1327
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:10,509
LAURA: That's a really cool dagger.

1328
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:12,858
LIAM: That's a 31.

1329
01:22:12,858 --> 01:22:14,504
TRAVIS: That hits.

1330
01:22:14,504 --> 01:22:20,850
LIAM: Yeah. On that one, I'm throwing it, so
that's not as crazy because I kind of blew my wad

1331
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:22,533
on the first one. That's a nine.

1332
01:22:22,533 --> 01:22:23,396
TRAVIS: A nine?

1333
01:22:23,396 --> 01:22:24,193
LIAM: A nine.

1334
01:22:24,193 --> 01:22:25,245
TRAVIS: Nine damage?

1335
01:22:25,245 --> 01:22:26,869
LAURA: Trinket did more damage than that.

1336
01:22:26,869 --> 01:22:28,049
TRAVIS: The bear did.

1337
01:22:28,049 --> 01:22:29,365
LIAM: How much did he do total?

1338
01:22:29,365 --> 01:22:30,268
LAURA: 23.

1339
01:22:30,268 --> 01:22:33,842
LIAM: Were you here when I did, like, 30-something
on the attack just before?

1340
01:22:33,842 --> 01:22:38,015
TRAVIS: This is not a competition. You hit it, and
it totally gets its attention. It sinks right into

1341
01:22:38,015 --> 01:22:41,079
its shoulder blade, and it's (pained growling),
and focuses on you.

1342
01:22:41,079 --> 01:22:42,527
LIAM: It focuses on me, but it was talking to
you.

1343
01:22:42,527 --> 01:22:44,349
TRAVIS: That's true, yeah. Scanlan, you're up.

1344
01:22:44,349 --> 01:22:54,011
SAM: I'm going to step forward and call to the
beast. "Beast, look in my eyes and follow my

1345
01:22:54,011 --> 01:23:03,641
"commands!" And I will cast Dominate Monster on the
beast. He has to roll a wisdom save.

1346
01:23:03,641 --> 01:23:05,079
TRAVIS: You got it. Okay.

1347
01:23:05,079 --> 01:23:06,359
SAM: Against 22.

1348
01:23:06,359 --> 01:23:07,961
LIAM: You must face Bavmorda.

1349
01:23:07,961 --> 01:23:13,002
TRAVIS: 20. It fails. You dominate the monster.

1350
01:23:13,002 --> 01:23:17,916
SAM: I command you, beast, to attack this bear.

1351
01:23:17,916 --> 01:23:19,929
LAURA: Scanlan!

1352
01:23:19,929 --> 01:23:21,960
SAM: Relentless attack!

1353
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:23,364
LAURA: What the fuck?!

1354
01:23:23,364 --> 01:23:27,510
SAM: I don't get to do this in real life, so I
thought I'd experiment with different things in

1355
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:28,841
fantasy land.

1356
01:23:28,841 --> 01:23:29,955
LAURA: Asshole.

1357
01:23:29,955 --> 01:23:33,276
TRAVIS: And next in the initiative order is
actually the hell hound, and he takes off running

1358
01:23:33,276 --> 01:23:40,151
straight towards Trinket. Yeah, it's real
unfortunate. He's going to unleash a bite att--

1359
01:23:40,151 --> 01:23:49,949
No, he's going to do Firebreath in a 15-foot cone.
Must make a DC 12 dexterity saving throw.

1360
01:23:49,949 --> 01:23:53,464
LAURA: Who all is in that cone?

1361
01:23:53,464 --> 01:23:56,160
TRAVIS: Roll a dexterity saving throw, Vex, Vax,
and Trinket.

1362
01:23:56,160 --> 01:24:01,193
LIAM: Vex, Vax, and Trinket? Oh. Oh, my boots are
on, so I do better at that now.

1363
01:24:01,193 --> 01:24:09,660
LAURA: Oh no. That's terrible for both of us.
Well, not bad for me. 18.

1364
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:10,756
LIAM: 21 for me.

1365
01:24:10,756 --> 01:24:11,810
LAURA: 18 for me.

1366
01:24:11,810 --> 01:24:12,990
TRAVIS: You both succeed.

1367
01:24:12,990 --> 01:24:15,234
LAURA: Trinket, though, is a four.

1368
01:24:15,234 --> 01:24:16,498
TRAVIS: Four.

1369
01:24:16,498 --> 01:24:17,960
TALIESIN: A four?

1370
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:20,117
LAURA: He's not very dexterous.

1371
01:24:20,117 --> 01:24:23,407
TRAVIS: So Trinket takes 29 points of fire
damage.

1372
01:24:23,407 --> 01:24:25,283
LIAM and LAURA: Oh no.

1373
01:24:25,283 --> 01:24:28,768
LIAM: So what does he look like? Set the scene
for us.

1374
01:24:28,768 --> 01:24:33,825
TRAVIS: You guys both take 19 points of fire
damage. Halved, because you made the save.

1375
01:24:33,825 --> 01:24:35,983
SAM: Wait, 19 is half of what?

1376
01:24:35,983 --> 01:24:36,872
TRAVIS: Wait.

1377
01:24:36,872 --> 01:24:39,075
SAM: Of 29? That tracks for Grog, sure.

1378
01:24:39,075 --> 01:24:41,093
LIAM: But what am I subtracting that from?

1379
01:24:41,093 --> 01:24:43,009
LAURA: Your health.

1380
01:24:43,009 --> 01:24:44,210
LIAM: What health?

1381
01:24:44,210 --> 01:24:45,635
LAURA: How much health do you have?

1382
01:24:45,635 --> 01:24:47,107
TRAVIS: Call it 14 points. We'll call it 14
points.

1383
01:24:47,107 --> 01:24:49,412
LIAM: I feel fine.

1384
01:24:49,412 --> 01:24:51,469
SAM: The BM is always right.

1385
01:24:51,469 --> 01:24:55,464
LIAM: Percival, what do I subtract it from?

1386
01:24:55,464 --> 01:24:56,639
TALIESIN: From your hit points.

1387
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:57,824
LIAM: What are hit points?

1388
01:24:57,824 --> 01:24:59,475
TALIESIN: Your hit points are your hit points.

1389
01:24:59,475 --> 01:25:01,130
LIAM: Is that over here somewhere?

1390
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:02,203
TALIESIN: I mean, I would hope so.

1391
01:25:02,203 --> 01:25:03,302
TRAVIS: You can read, right?

1392
01:25:03,302 --> 01:25:06,167
LIAM: I mean, I can. Doesn't mean I do.

1393
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:07,417
TRAVIS: Well, you should.

1394
01:25:07,417 --> 01:25:10,825
SAM: Grog, this noob is bringing
the whole table down.

1395
01:25:10,825 --> 01:25:12,904
TRAVIS: I know, it's terrible. I mean seriously.

1396
01:25:12,904 --> 01:25:14,301
LIAM: That says my name, Vax'ildan--

1397
01:25:14,301 --> 01:25:16,632
LAURA: Oh, right here.

1398
01:25:16,632 --> 01:25:17,695
LIAM: Where?

1399
01:25:17,695 --> 01:25:18,693
LAURA: Right. There.

1400
01:25:18,693 --> 01:25:25,198
LIAM: Oh, I got a lot. That's so many hit points.
I bet I have the most in the group. So I take

1401
01:25:25,198 --> 01:25:26,935
away, I think you said 14.

1402
01:25:26,935 --> 01:25:29,107
LAURA: Jeez, Trinket's pretty close to dying.

1403
01:25:29,107 --> 01:25:30,225
TRAVIS: Percival, you're up.

1404
01:25:30,225 --> 01:25:35,669
TALIESIN: I've really been excited about the spear
so I'm going to run forward and throw my spear.

1405
01:25:35,669 --> 01:25:37,565
TRAVIS: Okay, what's your speed? How far can you
move?

1406
01:25:37,565 --> 01:25:39,303
TALIESIN: I can move 30.

1407
01:25:39,303 --> 01:25:42,425
TRAVIS: 30? One, two, three--

1408
01:25:42,425 --> 01:25:45,283
TALIESIN: One, two, three, four, five, six...

1409
01:25:45,283 --> 01:25:49,340
TRAVIS: So unfortunately, Trinket stands between
you and the hell hound.

1410
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:54,042
TALIESIN: Well, I was going to angle out my little
walk a bit to the outskirts.

1411
01:25:54,042 --> 01:25:55,442
TRAVIS: Out this way more?

1412
01:25:55,442 --> 01:25:56,571
TALIESIN: Yeah, out that way more.

1413
01:25:56,571 --> 01:25:57,734
TRAVIS: Okay, so maybe over here?

1414
01:25:57,734 --> 01:26:01,203
TALIESIN: Right there. Yeah, like there. And I
think I can throw it--

1415
01:26:01,203 --> 01:26:02,410
TRAVIS: You want to throw it?

1416
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:03,484
TALIESIN: Yeah, like a javelin, yes.

1417
01:26:03,484 --> 01:26:05,342
TRAVIS: Okay, roll an attack at disadvantage.

1418
01:26:05,342 --> 01:26:06,758
TALIESIN: Why disadvantage?

1419
01:26:06,758 --> 01:26:08,880
TRAVIS: Because I've never seen you throw a
fucking spear before.

1420
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:16,455
(laughter)

1421
01:26:16,455 --> 01:26:18,731
TALIESIN: What is my attack with the spear?

1422
01:26:18,731 --> 01:26:21,076
TRAVIS: Plus two.

1423
01:26:21,076 --> 01:26:22,483
TALIESIN: All right.

1424
01:26:22,483 --> 01:26:25,506
LAURA: Oh shit, that's really low. Roll high,
darling.

1425
01:26:25,506 --> 01:26:28,316
TALIESIN: A seven then, if it's plus two.

1426
01:26:28,316 --> 01:26:30,546
TRAVIS: Yeah, good. You throw the spear and it--

1427
01:26:30,546 --> 01:26:31,709
SAM: Hits Trinket!

1428
01:26:31,709 --> 01:26:37,269
TRAVIS: It just disappears. You're not quite sure
where but you hear a sploosh. You hear the splash

1429
01:26:37,269 --> 01:26:40,524
as it seems to disappear into the fountain behind
the hell hound.

1430
01:26:40,524 --> 01:26:48,224
TALIESIN: Well, fine then. I'm going to just sit
there and be disappointed then.

1431
01:26:48,224 --> 01:26:53,053
TRAVIS: Good, nice. Vex, you're up.

1432
01:26:53,053 --> 01:26:55,962
LAURA: Oh, okay.

1433
01:26:55,962 --> 01:26:57,903
TRAVIS: You have a bonus action if you want it.

1434
01:26:57,903 --> 01:27:01,404
TALIESIN: Okay. What can I do with a bonus action?
Can I just do whatever I like?

1435
01:27:01,404 --> 01:27:02,936
SAM: I've seen you burn grits.

1436
01:27:02,936 --> 01:27:04,960
TRAVIS: Yeah, I just assume you'll know that
better than me.

1437
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,225
TALIESIN: I let you cook, this is your
mansion.

1438
01:27:07,225 --> 01:27:08,684
SAM: That's true.

1439
01:27:08,684 --> 01:27:12,150
TALIESIN: And my grits are best burnt. Makes them
a little crispy.

1440
01:27:12,150 --> 01:27:21,063
LAURA: I'm going to-- <i>Trinket</i> is going to bite
him back because he's a dick.

1441
01:27:21,063 --> 01:27:22,793
TRAVIS: Nice, roll an attack.

1442
01:27:22,793 --> 01:27:29,323
LAURA: Okay. That's good. 28.

1443
01:27:29,323 --> 01:27:30,817
TRAVIS: That'll hit.

1444
01:27:30,817 --> 01:27:39,941
LAURA: Okay. So he's going to do this. Ten for
him. Does he get my Hunter's Mark as well?

1445
01:27:39,941 --> 01:27:41,156
TRAVIS: No.

1446
01:27:41,156 --> 01:27:47,379
LAURA: All right. Just checking. And then I'm
going to shoot an arrow while he's doing that so

1447
01:27:47,379 --> 01:27:48,784
the creature's distracted, right?

1448
01:27:48,784 --> 01:27:51,127
TRAVIS: Sounds good.

1449
01:27:51,127 --> 01:27:53,133
LIAM: Why do you decide for Trinket what Trinket
does?

1450
01:27:53,133 --> 01:27:56,975
LAURA: Well, I mean, he's not at the table playing
right now, so I have to say what he's going to do.

1451
01:27:56,975 --> 01:27:59,029
TRAVIS: He's outside.

1452
01:27:59,029 --> 01:28:00,074
LAURA: No, he's right behind me.

1453
01:28:00,074 --> 01:28:01,046
TRAVIS: Oh, he's asleep?

1454
01:28:01,046 --> 01:28:01,999
LAURA: Yeah, he's right there.

1455
01:28:01,999 --> 01:28:04,119
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry. He blends into the furniture.

1456
01:28:04,119 --> 01:28:06,958
SAM: It's true, all my furniture is bearskin
furniture.

1457
01:28:06,958 --> 01:28:08,879
TRAVIS: That's super insensitive.

1458
01:28:08,879 --> 01:28:10,648
LIAM: But only since you met Vex.

1459
01:28:10,648 --> 01:28:14,113
LAURA: I got 31.

1460
01:28:14,113 --> 01:28:15,928
TRAVIS: 31 damage?

1461
01:28:15,928 --> 01:28:17,130
LAURA: No, 31 to hit.

1462
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:18,325
TRAVIS: Oh, to hit. It hits.

1463
01:28:18,325 --> 01:28:20,623
SAM: I don't even clean it, it's just bloody bear
skin.

1464
01:28:20,623 --> 01:28:32,507
LAURA: You're terrible. 16, 17. Where are they?

1465
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:33,968
LIAM: Just make it up, this is imagination.

1466
01:28:33,968 --> 01:28:35,268
TRAVIS: Are you lacking die?

1467
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:36,411
LAURA: I don't know.

1468
01:28:36,411 --> 01:28:37,577
TRAVIS: How is that possible?

1469
01:28:37,577 --> 01:28:39,291
LAURA: Oh, what did I say I was at?

1470
01:28:39,291 --> 01:28:40,309
TRAVIS: 13.

1471
01:28:40,309 --> 01:28:42,629
LAURA: 13? Okay, good. 13, 16, 17.

1472
01:28:42,629 --> 01:28:43,817
TRAVIS: 17.

1473
01:28:43,817 --> 01:28:44,714
LAURA: Yes.

1474
01:28:44,714 --> 01:28:49,575
TRAVIS: And with that you hit the hell hound and
the arrow sinks in and he too starts to catch fire

1475
01:28:49,575 --> 01:28:55,602
from the wound and he's like (howling), and he
just evaporates.

1476
01:28:55,602 --> 01:28:56,761
LAURA: I killed it!

1477
01:28:56,761 --> 01:28:58,432
TALIESIN: Look at that. That's brilliant.

1478
01:28:58,432 --> 01:29:01,907
LAURA: It's dead. Trinket and I killed it! Good
job, darling.

1479
01:29:01,907 --> 01:29:04,766
TRAVIS: Yeah. Not that's it's a competition, but
you've killed something, Trinket's killed

1480
01:29:04,766 --> 01:29:06,875
something, and you've killed something.

1481
01:29:06,875 --> 01:29:08,368
SAM: Any points?

1482
01:29:08,368 --> 01:29:10,931
LIAM: Did I get any points? Did I get any XP?

1483
01:29:10,931 --> 01:29:16,136
TRAVIS: There were only 450 to give out for the
entire game, so it's all been used.

1484
01:29:16,136 --> 01:29:18,975
TALIESIN: You still have another 200 to give.

1485
01:29:18,975 --> 01:29:23,260
TRAVIS: There is 200 more to give. You'll get 50
XP.

1486
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:24,183
LAURA: Thank you.

1487
01:29:24,183 --> 01:29:25,113
TRAVIS: Thank you, Percival.

1488
01:29:25,113 --> 01:29:26,089
TALIESIN: You're welcome.

1489
01:29:26,089 --> 01:29:28,958
TRAVIS: I can only juggle so many, you know,
parrots at one time.

1490
01:29:28,958 --> 01:29:31,798
LIAM: So how it works is you have to get all the
XP at the very beginning.

1491
01:29:31,798 --> 01:29:35,206
TALIESIN: Yeah, the XB.

1492
01:29:35,206 --> 01:29:37,183
LIAM: The XB; what does the B stand for?

1493
01:29:37,183 --> 01:29:40,361
SAM: Boints. Xylophone bears.

1494
01:29:40,361 --> 01:29:44,835
TRAVIS: So the hell hounds have been destroyed and
the cavern is again quiet. What would you like to do?

1495
01:29:44,835 --> 01:29:49,739
LAURA: I want to run my hands through the
fountain.

1496
01:29:49,739 --> 01:29:51,989
TRAVIS: Okay. So you go up to the fountain--

1497
01:29:51,989 --> 01:29:53,940
SAM: I'd like to go to the other fountain and
do the same.

1498
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:57,065
TRAVIS: You can go to this one, yep.

1499
01:29:57,065 --> 01:30:00,516
LAURA: Just so we can do this. In the fountain
water.

1500
01:30:00,516 --> 01:30:03,927
TRAVIS: Roll a constitution saving throw.

1501
01:30:03,927 --> 01:30:05,529
LAURA: Oh no!

1502
01:30:05,529 --> 01:30:07,125
LIAM: Gently first, though.

1503
01:30:07,125 --> 01:30:10,981
SAM: 11.

1504
01:30:10,981 --> 01:30:11,989
LAURA: 14.

1505
01:30:11,989 --> 01:30:13,055
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's just water.

1506
01:30:13,055 --> 01:30:15,118
LAURA: Oh good. Okay. So I'm going to wash my
hands off.

1507
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:19,796
TRAVIS: So you notice as you're washing your hands
off right, it's a very nice color, Grog wanders off--

1508
01:30:19,796 --> 01:30:21,979
SAM: Do the fountains get any harder?

1509
01:30:21,979 --> 01:30:24,384
TRAVIS: No they don't. Just nice and yeah.

1510
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:26,518
TALIESIN: Is it hard water or soft water I think
is what he's asking.

1511
01:30:26,518 --> 01:30:29,085
TRAVIS: It's a good question. Would you like to
roll an intelligence check?

1512
01:30:29,085 --> 01:30:30,361
TALIESIN: I'm going to roll an intelligence check
on that.

1513
01:30:30,361 --> 01:30:31,833
TRAVIS: Which fountain are you inspecting?

1514
01:30:31,833 --> 01:30:33,805
TALIESIN: I'm inspecting Scanlan's fountain.

1515
01:30:33,805 --> 01:30:37,595
TRAVIS: Okay, you come over to Scanlan's fountain
and you're inspecting that one as well.

1516
01:30:37,595 --> 01:30:39,370
LIAM: Maybe you should taste it.

1517
01:30:39,370 --> 01:30:42,412
LAURA: Shut up. That's-- no, he really shouldn't.

1518
01:30:42,412 --> 01:30:43,677
TALIESIN: Ooh. Is this investigation?

1519
01:30:43,677 --> 01:30:44,711
TRAVIS: Intelligence.

1520
01:30:44,711 --> 01:30:47,682
TALIESIN: Intelligence? All right, then that's a
24.

1521
01:30:47,682 --> 01:30:54,092
TRAVIS: 24, yeah, this is very soft water. It is
very nice. It's got like a salt treatment to it.

1522
01:30:54,092 --> 01:31:00,933
It's very nice, yeah. It's good for your skin,
there's vitamins in there, there's potassium and

1523
01:31:00,933 --> 01:31:03,080
mercury and stuff.

1524
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:06,748
LAURA: Do you have any dessert? Do you have
servants making any dessert?

1525
01:31:06,748 --> 01:31:08,316
SAM: In this or in the game?

1526
01:31:08,316 --> 01:31:11,365
LAURA: In here, in the mansion.

1527
01:31:11,365 --> 01:31:21,223
SAM: In the mansion. Sure, yes. We have some
desserts. Trying to think of vegan desserts. Not flan.

1528
01:31:21,223 --> 01:31:23,732
TALIESIN: You know, you can make a very nice vegan
creme brulee.

1529
01:31:23,732 --> 01:31:25,082
LIAM: Sorbet?

1530
01:31:25,082 --> 01:31:33,474
SAM: Sorbet is right. It's just fruit and sugar,
right? All right. Five...six? Five. We're five.

1531
01:31:33,474 --> 01:31:37,220
LAURA: Yeah. Well, six because we might have
extra. Trinket.

1532
01:31:37,220 --> 01:31:40,785
SAM: Five pomegranate sorbets please.

1533
01:31:40,785 --> 01:31:42,434
TRAVIS: Nice.

1534
01:31:42,434 --> 01:31:44,351
SAM: Seeds in.

1535
01:31:44,351 --> 01:31:48,933
TRAVIS: So as you're inspecting the fountains, you
notice that Grog, having watched you guys be very

1536
01:31:48,933 --> 01:31:55,702
careful checking for traps and everything is doing
the same, he's trying to do his part. Yeah, and lo

1537
01:31:55,702 --> 01:32:01,955
and behold he finds an edge in the wall just like
you found before and he pushes it open and inside

1538
01:32:01,955 --> 01:32:05,501
there is 20 platinum.

1539
01:32:05,501 --> 01:32:07,422
SAM: Wow!

1540
01:32:07,422 --> 01:32:08,866
LAURA: 20 platinum?!

1541
01:32:08,866 --> 01:32:14,313
TRAVIS: Yeah. "Guys! I found 20 platinum in this
secret passage."

1542
01:32:14,313 --> 01:32:18,276
LAURA: Oh my god. Can I see some platinum too? Can
I go over there?

1543
01:32:18,276 --> 01:32:21,765
TRAVIS: Platinum's mine, but you never know what
else is around. Maybe look for yourself.

1544
01:32:21,765 --> 01:32:23,274
LAURA: I look for other secret doors.

1545
01:32:23,274 --> 01:32:26,864
TRAVIS: All right, roll a perception check.
Investigation check!

1546
01:32:26,893 --> 01:32:31,336
LAURA: Okay. 25.

1547
01:32:31,336 --> 01:32:37,186
TRAVIS: 25? Yeah, in fact on the exact opposite
side of the cavern you find a similar door and do

1548
01:32:37,186 --> 01:32:38,772
you want to push it open?

1549
01:32:38,772 --> 01:32:39,662
LAURA: Yeah!

1550
01:32:39,662 --> 01:32:44,304
TRAVIS: Yeah. So you push and there seems to be
something coiled up on the ground in the corner.

1551
01:32:44,304 --> 01:32:48,276
LAURA: Is it a monster or is it platinum?

1552
01:32:48,276 --> 01:32:51,126
TRAVIS: It's not a creature or anything. Do you
want it or not?

1553
01:32:51,126 --> 01:32:53,050
LAURA: Does it look like platinum?

1554
01:32:53,050 --> 01:32:54,588
TRAVIS: Could be.

1555
01:32:54,588 --> 01:32:56,074
LAURA: Okay. Can I look at it?

1556
01:32:56,074 --> 01:32:58,151
TRAVIS: Yeah. Roll a perception check.

1557
01:32:58,151 --> 01:33:02,434
LAURA: 29.

1558
01:33:02,434 --> 01:33:03,774
TRAVIS: It's a big pile of poop.

1559
01:33:03,774 --> 01:33:04,984
LAURA: Aww.

1560
01:33:04,984 --> 01:33:06,290
TRAVIS: You found a poo.

1561
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:07,492
LAURA: Grog.

1562
01:33:07,492 --> 01:33:09,536
LIAM: May I search the bottom of each nipple?

1563
01:33:09,536 --> 01:33:10,942
TRAVIS: Each what?

1564
01:33:10,942 --> 01:33:12,159
LAURA: It's a fountain.

1565
01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:13,376
LIAM: That's what I said.

1566
01:33:13,376 --> 01:33:15,455
TRAVIS: You want to search the bottom of each
fountain?

1567
01:33:15,455 --> 01:33:16,474
LIAM: Yeah.

1568
01:33:16,474 --> 01:33:17,984
TRAVIS: Sure.

1569
01:33:17,984 --> 01:33:19,536
LIAM: Like feel around, see if there's any loot.

1570
01:33:19,536 --> 01:33:20,780
TRAVIS: Which one would you like to start on?
Scanlan's or--?

1571
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:21,861
LIAM: Well there's one right behind me.

1572
01:33:21,861 --> 01:33:22,863
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.

1573
01:33:22,863 --> 01:33:23,985
LIAM: I should do the one closest to me.

1574
01:33:23,985 --> 01:33:24,944
TRAVIS: There you go.

1575
01:33:24,944 --> 01:33:27,536
LIAM: I'm going to see if there's any traps in
there if I'm going to stick my hand deep into that

1576
01:33:27,536 --> 01:33:28,580
thing.

1577
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:29,978
TRAVIS: Yeah, roll an investigation check.

1578
01:33:29,978 --> 01:33:34,667
LIAM: Of course. Oh, that's really good. I'm
getting the hang of this. That is a 26.

1579
01:33:34,667 --> 01:33:41,816
TRAVIS: There do not appear to be any traps. Yeah.
Bottom of the fountain you find-- it's like a

1580
01:33:41,816 --> 01:33:47,157
mossy bottom and there's some pebbles, but it
seems like that might've come from the stones

1581
01:33:47,157 --> 01:33:50,480
overhead, but there doesn't appear to be any
objects in the bottom of the fountain.

1582
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:52,769
LAURA: What's that door on the far end?

1583
01:33:52,769 --> 01:33:54,616
SAM: Let's go investigate that door over there.

1584
01:33:54,616 --> 01:33:56,425
TRAVIS: Who does?

1585
01:33:56,425 --> 01:33:57,471
SAM: I'll go over there.

1586
01:33:57,471 --> 01:33:58,470
TRAVIS: You'll go over there?

1587
01:33:58,470 --> 01:33:59,166
SAM: Yeah.

1588
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:00,596
LAURA: Trinket's going to join him.

1589
01:34:00,596 --> 01:34:03,711
TRAVIS: So Scanlan's little legs just like
(footsteps) all the way over here.

1590
01:34:03,711 --> 01:34:07,898
There goes Trinket. So you see before you--

1591
01:34:07,898 --> 01:34:10,770
LAURA: Trinket's going to bite Scanlan's
shoulder.

1592
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:12,245
TRAVIS: Roll to attack.

1593
01:34:12,245 --> 01:34:15,286
LIAM: I love how automatic that was.

1594
01:34:15,286 --> 01:34:21,385
LAURA: Oh, that's not my attack, 
it's Trinket's attack. 19.

1595
01:34:21,385 --> 01:34:23,115
TRAVIS: 19. What's your AC?

1596
01:34:23,115 --> 01:34:24,160
SAM: That hits.

1597
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:25,702
TRAVIS: Ooh. Roll for damage.

1598
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:28,730
LAURA: Great. Okay. 
This is what you get, Scanlan.

1599
01:34:28,730 --> 01:34:29,904
SAM: Sure.

1600
01:34:29,904 --> 01:34:33,236
LAURA: 14.

1601
01:34:33,236 --> 01:34:39,619
TRAVIS: 14 points of damage. 
The bear sinks its teeth into your shoulder

1602
01:34:39,619 --> 01:34:41,703
and gives you a little jiggle.

1603
01:34:41,703 --> 01:34:43,361
SAM: (groans)

1604
01:34:43,361 --> 01:34:46,773
TRAVIS: That saliva starts to burn. 
Yeah, bear saliva.

1605
01:34:46,773 --> 01:34:48,520
LAURA: Yeah, he doesn't brush his teeth.

1606
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:52,745
SAM: Ow! Ouch! Why would you do that, Trinket?

1607
01:34:52,745 --> 01:34:56,451
LAURA: (bear growling)

1608
01:34:56,451 --> 01:34:58,938
TALIESIN: That's a very good Trinket. 
That's very impressive.

1609
01:34:58,938 --> 01:35:02,095
LIAM: He's got breath worse than a decrepit old
dachshund, too.

1610
01:35:02,095 --> 01:35:03,856
SAM: I feel like I should retaliate.

1611
01:35:03,856 --> 01:35:05,316
LAURA: I don't think you should.

1612
01:35:05,316 --> 01:35:08,120
SAM: But that might piss off Vex.

1613
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:12,696
TRAVIS: Might. There is also this incredible door
in front of you.

1614
01:35:12,696 --> 01:35:19,452
LAURA: You should check out the door. 
He unbites you and licks your shoulder.

1615
01:35:19,452 --> 01:35:22,484
Which really just adds more bacteria to it.

1616
01:35:22,484 --> 01:35:25,401
SAM: I will inspect the door.

1617
01:35:25,401 --> 01:35:27,371
TRAVIS: Make a perception check.

1618
01:35:27,371 --> 01:35:31,439
SAM: Five.

1619
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:37,338
TRAVIS: Five. You see before you a door,
magnificent, brilliantly ornate. It's made of

1620
01:35:37,338 --> 01:35:41,768
several different kinds of wood and iron. You know
everything about this.

1621
01:35:41,768 --> 01:35:43,158
SAM: I open it.

1622
01:35:43,158 --> 01:35:44,665
TRAVIS: How do you open it?

1623
01:35:44,665 --> 01:35:46,113
SAM: Is there a handle?

1624
01:35:46,113 --> 01:35:49,755
TRAVIS: Yes, there is, there is a latch.

1625
01:35:49,755 --> 01:35:54,777
LIAM: This is game of fantasy and imagination, so
it's just going to open and not hurt us at all.

1626
01:35:54,777 --> 01:35:56,926
SAM: I'll open the latch.

1627
01:35:56,926 --> 01:36:00,159
TRAVIS: The door opens. It just opens.

1628
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:04,289
TALIESIN: What madness is this?!

1629
01:36:04,289 --> 01:36:05,818
LIAM: This is a utopia!

1630
01:36:05,818 --> 01:36:11,759
TRAVIS: The door swings open. You notice as it
opens there's a carving in the wood of a large

1631
01:36:11,759 --> 01:36:18,896
tower. As it swings open, it reveals in front of
it a small structure about 30 to 50 feet out in

1632
01:36:18,896 --> 01:36:20,857
front of you and darkness beyond.

1633
01:36:20,857 --> 01:36:22,532
TALIESIN: Nothing happened when we opened the
door?

1634
01:36:22,532 --> 01:36:23,198
TRAVIS: No.

1635
01:36:23,198 --> 01:36:24,294
TALIESIN: Are you sure you're doing it right?

1636
01:36:24,294 --> 01:36:26,227
TRAVIS: Yeah, shockingly.

1637
01:36:26,227 --> 01:36:28,393
LAURA: What was outside of the door?

1638
01:36:28,393 --> 01:36:35,873
TRAVIS: As Scanlan and Trinket are looking through
the doorway, they see a structure about 30 to 50

1639
01:36:35,873 --> 01:36:40,882
feet away from the doorway. Further into another
space is just darkness beyond.

1640
01:36:40,882 --> 01:36:45,956
LIAM: My own bathroom door in Whitestone hits me
for one point of bludgeoning damage every time I

1641
01:36:45,956 --> 01:36:47,170
use it.

1642
01:36:47,170 --> 01:36:49,071
TALIESIN: It's designed for that; it's a door!

1643
01:36:49,071 --> 01:36:51,727
LIAM: This door is faulty.

1644
01:36:51,727 --> 01:36:55,975
LAURA: We go through it. I want to walk towards
the structure.

1645
01:36:55,975 --> 01:36:57,573
TRAVIS: You go through the doorway?

1646
01:36:57,573 --> 01:36:59,909
SAM: I'm going through the doorway first with
Trinket.

1647
01:36:59,909 --> 01:37:02,257
TRAVIS: Would everyone like to go through the
doorway?

1648
01:37:02,257 --> 01:37:04,241
TALIESIN: I'm going to watch everyone else go
through the doorway.

1649
01:37:04,241 --> 01:37:05,541
TRAVIS: You're going to stay behind?

1650
01:37:05,541 --> 01:37:07,592
TALIESIN: I'm going to go through once they've
started to go through. I'm going to make sure

1651
01:37:07,592 --> 01:37:09,194
everything's good.

1652
01:37:09,194 --> 01:37:10,482
TRAVIS: Who goes first?

1653
01:37:10,482 --> 01:37:11,515
SAM: I will go first.

1654
01:37:11,515 --> 01:37:16,820
TRAVIS: Scanlan, you get to the doorway and the
second you start to cross the threshold, you feel

1655
01:37:16,820 --> 01:37:21,487
the force start to pull you towards the door,
almost as if someone has removed the stopper from

1656
01:37:21,487 --> 01:37:27,801
a bathtub. You feel yourself being pulled through.
I need everyone to make dexterity saving throws.

1657
01:37:27,801 --> 01:37:28,788
LAURA: All of us?!

1658
01:37:28,788 --> 01:37:29,749
TRAVIS: All of you.

1659
01:37:29,749 --> 01:37:31,867
LIAM: Even if we didn't say we were going towards
the door?

1660
01:37:31,867 --> 01:37:32,845
TRAVIS: Yep.

1661
01:37:32,845 --> 01:37:34,480
LIAM: I knew it was too good to be true.

1662
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:35,517
SAM: I rolled a one.

1663
01:37:35,517 --> 01:37:36,772
LAURA: I rolled a one!

1664
01:37:36,772 --> 01:37:38,124
TALIESIN: I rolled a 21.

1665
01:37:38,124 --> 01:37:45,715
LAURA: Let's see what Trinket rolls. That's
cocked. Trinket rolled 18.

1666
01:37:45,715 --> 01:37:48,099
TRAVIS: 18? Okay. Vax?

1667
01:37:48,099 --> 01:37:49,716
LIAM: Vax'ildan rolled a 30.

1668
01:37:49,716 --> 01:37:56,802
TRAVIS: 30. Everyone except for Vax and Percy are
immediately pulled through the threshold.

1669
01:37:56,802 --> 01:37:58,522
LAURA: What about Grog?

1670
01:37:58,522 --> 01:38:02,354
LIAM: Freddie. Up top!

1671
01:38:02,354 --> 01:38:05,508
TRAVIS: That's a seven. Grog also pulled through
the doorway.

1672
01:38:05,508 --> 01:38:08,210
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right, we didn't go through
the door.

1673
01:38:08,210 --> 01:38:10,870
TRAVIS: Vax and Percy manage to cling to the side
of the threshold.

1674
01:38:10,870 --> 01:38:12,776
LIAM: Fucking dummies, right?

1675
01:38:12,776 --> 01:38:14,674
TALIESIN: This is why you never trust a door.

1676
01:38:14,674 --> 01:38:19,915
TRAVIS: You still feel this force pulling you,
like there's been an atmospheric pull through the

1677
01:38:19,915 --> 01:38:26,938
doorway. You hear, on the other side, your
comrades getting up, seemingly fine.

1678
01:38:26,938 --> 01:38:30,549
LAURA: What a nice journey that was! I really
enjoyed that.

1679
01:38:30,549 --> 01:38:36,458
TRAVIS: For you two, on this side of the door, the
pull is still incredibly strong. You can try and

1680
01:38:36,521 --> 01:38:38,274
fight it or you can go through.

1681
01:38:38,274 --> 01:38:41,330
TALIESIN: I'm curious to hear how this sensation
will be narrated.

1682
01:38:41,330 --> 01:38:49,090
LIAM: Yeah, I'd like to wait and also to mull over
who is this more painful for: you, Vex'ahlia's

1683
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:55,058
husband and lover, or me, her oldest friend and
twin brother. It's hard to tell. Grog, can you

1684
01:38:55,058 --> 01:38:56,873
enlighten us?

1685
01:38:56,873 --> 01:39:01,178
TRAVIS: Yes. As you're mulling this over, you get
12 points of force damage.

1686
01:39:01,178 --> 01:39:02,856
TALIESIN and LIAM: That's fine.

1687
01:39:02,856 --> 01:39:05,069
LIAM: Let's feel this out.

1688
01:39:05,069 --> 01:39:10,041
TALIESIN: I was curious what kind of hardware is
attaching this door to the wall? Is it standard

1689
01:39:10,041 --> 01:39:12,136
brass brackets? Triple bracket?

1690
01:39:12,136 --> 01:39:13,184
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1691
01:39:13,184 --> 01:39:17,528
TALIESIN: Does it have a two-way turn? Can you
describe this?

1692
01:39:17,528 --> 01:39:23,054
TRAVIS: It's almost as if you saw it for yourself
with those descriptions. Really quite impressive.

1693
01:39:23,054 --> 01:39:24,651
TALIESIN: Can you describe me seeing it for
myself?

1694
01:39:24,651 --> 01:39:29,355
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's the triple brass tracket.
There's lumber and stone.

1695
01:39:29,355 --> 01:39:30,717
TALIESIN: There is lumber and stone.

1696
01:39:30,717 --> 01:39:33,461
TRAVIS: Iron. Gold inlay on the door.

1697
01:39:33,461 --> 01:39:34,834
TALIESIN: That's quite nice.

1698
01:39:34,834 --> 01:39:36,153
TRAVIS: Yep. And a picture of a tower.

1699
01:39:36,153 --> 01:39:41,050
LIAM: While he studies the door, I'm studying
Percival. Does he look more rugged and

1700
01:39:41,121 --> 01:39:45,710
good-looking as his hair is blown towards the
door, or less?

1701
01:39:45,710 --> 01:39:48,570
TRAVIS: You know right when you slap someone after
you've had too much to drink and their face is

1702
01:39:48,570 --> 01:39:51,884
doing the pull? That's what his face looks like
constantly.

1703
01:39:51,884 --> 01:39:54,034
TALIESIN: Well, if you'd said <i>that</i>, I'm letting
go and I'm going through the door.

1704
01:39:54,034 --> 01:39:59,116
TRAVIS: You let go and you go through the door.
Vax, you're the only one still on this side of the door.

1705
01:39:59,116 --> 01:40:05,508
LIAM: Okay. I do a five-count: One, two, three,
four, five. And then I just go: Motherfucker! And

1706
01:40:05,508 --> 01:40:08,074
I grip my own shoulders and dive.

1707
01:40:08,074 --> 01:40:12,644
TRAVIS: Yeah. And you go right through the doorway
as well. You both fall with a clatter to the

1708
01:40:12,644 --> 01:40:20,423
floor, and you notice that in front of you is a
structure.

1709
01:40:20,423 --> 01:40:22,499
LIAM: The Pentagon.

1710
01:40:22,499 --> 01:40:25,160
LAURA: What is this? Oh, look at all those
carpets. Do they fly?

1711
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:27,265
LIAM: Is this Heaven?

1712
01:40:27,265 --> 01:40:28,585
LAURA: Is this Heaven?

1713
01:40:28,585 --> 01:40:31,619
TRAVIS: You're prone, Percy's prone.

1714
01:40:31,619 --> 01:40:34,675
TALIESIN: I don't think I <i>can</i> go prone.

1715
01:40:34,675 --> 01:40:35,901
TRAVIS: Really?

1716
01:40:35,901 --> 01:40:37,184
TALIESIN: I don't think I can prone.

1717
01:40:37,184 --> 01:40:38,357
LAURA: Really?

1718
01:40:38,357 --> 01:40:40,354
TALIESIN: Let me double-check this. I don't
think I can.

1719
01:40:40,354 --> 01:40:41,622
LIAM: Can you be pwned?

1720
01:40:41,622 --> 01:40:43,172
TALIESIN: There's no pwning here.

1721
01:40:43,172 --> 01:40:45,639
TRAVIS: You see before you--

1722
01:40:45,639 --> 01:40:48,183
TALIESIN: Yep. I cannot be knocked prone.

1723
01:40:48,183 --> 01:40:51,586
TRAVIS: Nice. You're on your feet.

1724
01:40:51,586 --> 01:40:52,875
LAURA: Just Vax, then.

1725
01:40:52,875 --> 01:40:54,674
LIAM: I also cannot be knocked prone.

1726
01:40:54,674 --> 01:41:08,087
TRAVIS: You see before you a brilliant structure
in the shape of a circle. It's quite massive. Made

1727
01:41:08,087 --> 01:41:12,444
of stone. There seems to be some sort of
architecture about it.

1728
01:41:12,444 --> 01:41:16,516
SAM: Are we able to see inside, like we are right
now, Grog?

1729
01:41:16,516 --> 01:41:17,693
TRAVIS: No.

1730
01:41:17,693 --> 01:41:20,305
SAM: So we don't know that there's carpets in the
individual rooms in there?

1731
01:41:20,305 --> 01:41:21,705
TRAVIS: No.

1732
01:41:21,705 --> 01:41:23,619
LIAM: I can see them, though, right there.

1733
01:41:23,619 --> 01:41:25,088
TRAVIS: Just pretend like you don't.

1734
01:41:25,088 --> 01:41:27,655
LAURA: Are those doors, or are those windows on
the side?

1735
01:41:27,655 --> 01:41:34,915
TRAVIS: Those are doors. You see on each side of
the structure, there are doors. Around you, you

1736
01:41:34,915 --> 01:41:41,009
find yourself in a void, black space all around.
In fact, you turn around to see the doorway with

1737
01:41:41,009 --> 01:41:42,862
which you came has disappeared.

1738
01:41:42,862 --> 01:41:44,984
LAURA: What are we standing on?

1739
01:41:44,984 --> 01:41:46,422
TALIESIN: That's really mysterious.

1740
01:41:46,422 --> 01:41:50,720
TRAVIS: You're standing on stone, but in each
direction it just seems darkness after about 20 to

1741
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:56,541
30 feet. There is no determinable light source.
It's just you're able to see here.

1742
01:41:56,541 --> 01:42:01,438
SAM: I'm just gonna walk around the five-sided
circle and just make sure there's doors on each of

1743
01:42:01,438 --> 01:42:02,797
its five sides.

1744
01:42:02,797 --> 01:42:04,991
LAURA: They look like they have different symbols
on them.

1745
01:42:04,991 --> 01:42:09,424
TRAVIS: Right. There is, in fact, doors on each
one of the faces. One of them appears to be open.

1746
01:42:09,424 --> 01:42:11,737
LIAM: And is this also permanent marker?

1747
01:42:11,737 --> 01:42:14,058
TRAVIS: Maybe.

1748
01:42:14,058 --> 01:42:15,257
LIAM: All right.

1749
01:42:15,257 --> 01:42:16,855
SAM: Which one is open?

1750
01:42:16,855 --> 01:42:20,202
TRAVIS: It appears that the door on this side is
open.

1751
01:42:20,202 --> 01:42:23,388
SAM: The one with the star on it. I'd like to go
investigate that door.

1752
01:42:23,388 --> 01:42:29,354
TRAVIS: All right. Yes. So, you go over and find
this open door. And as you look, there is a symbol

1753
01:42:29,354 --> 01:42:38,201
above the doorway. It seems to be the symbol of a
star. And the door is open. Would you like to

1754
01:42:38,201 --> 01:42:39,179
investigate?

1755
01:42:39,179 --> 01:42:40,129
SAM: I would like to investigate.

1756
01:42:40,129 --> 01:42:41,446
TRAVIS: Roll an investigation check.

1757
01:42:41,446 --> 01:42:43,818
LIAM: Grog, may I use an action to stand up?

1758
01:42:43,818 --> 01:42:45,154
SAM: 24.

1759
01:42:45,154 --> 01:42:47,948
TRAVIS: 24. Yes, you may stand up.

1760
01:42:47,948 --> 01:42:48,978
LIAM: Yes!

1761
01:42:48,978 --> 01:42:51,415
TRAVIS: You are facing the wrong way again.

1762
01:42:51,415 --> 01:42:54,567
LIAM: That'll be my next action, to turn
around.

1763
01:42:54,567 --> 01:43:01,275
TRAVIS: You see before you a wooden and iron door
with a handle. And it has been seemingly forced

1764
01:43:01,275 --> 01:43:07,646
open. Inside, there is a room, and from what you
can see from your vantage point, it seems a very

1765
01:43:07,646 --> 01:43:12,827
comfortable room. You see a rug on the floor, a
potted plant on the side, and what seems to be a

1766
01:43:12,827 --> 01:43:14,424
chest at the end of the room.

1767
01:43:14,424 --> 01:43:15,907
SAM: No traps that I saw?

1768
01:43:15,907 --> 01:43:17,452
TRAVIS: Does not appear to be trapped.

1769
01:43:17,452 --> 01:43:19,085
SAM: All right, I'll step into the room.

1770
01:43:19,085 --> 01:43:20,329
TRAVIS: You step in.

1771
01:43:20,329 --> 01:43:21,822
LIAM: Seems wise.

1772
01:43:21,822 --> 01:43:34,263
SAM: While no one is looking at me, I will take
out a bit of meat and the poison I've never used

1773
01:43:34,263 --> 01:43:42,962
in the game, it's called Death Blade Poison. I've
had it since we ran Pathfinder.

1774
01:43:42,962 --> 01:43:44,728
LAURA: Oh shit.

1775
01:43:44,728 --> 01:43:48,131
SAM: I'm gonna just tuck it into the meat. Just
keep it with me.

1776
01:43:48,131 --> 01:43:56,363
LIAM: Oh no. I think you're supposed to keep what
you know and what you don't know separate.

1777
01:43:56,363 --> 01:43:57,867
LAURA: But I know.

1778
01:43:57,867 --> 01:44:04,322
LIAM: That's called, what was it-- Mata-gaming.
Mota-gaming?

1779
01:44:04,322 --> 01:44:05,507
SAM: Meka-gaming.

1780
01:44:05,507 --> 01:44:07,816
LIAM: Meka-gaming. You can't Mega Man-game--

1781
01:44:07,816 --> 01:44:12,191
SAM: All right, I'm looking about the room for
anything interesting.

1782
01:44:12,191 --> 01:44:14,283
TALIESIN: There's a potted plant.

1783
01:44:14,283 --> 01:44:18,742
TRAVIS: From your investigation check, you saw
there was a potted plant on the side of the room.

1784
01:44:18,742 --> 01:44:25,243
A nice rug on the floor. An open chest near the
back of the room, and it looks like to be just a

1785
01:44:25,243 --> 01:44:27,284
simple table with chairs on the other wall.

1786
01:44:27,284 --> 01:44:32,276
SAM: All right. I will look under the rug.

1787
01:44:32,276 --> 01:44:34,109
TRAVIS: Under the rug?

1788
01:44:34,109 --> 01:44:35,446
TALIESIN: Under the rug?

1789
01:44:35,446 --> 01:44:37,299
TRAVIS: You pick up the rug?

1790
01:44:37,299 --> 01:44:38,667
SAM: Just a little bit, yeah.

1791
01:44:38,667 --> 01:44:42,112
TRAVIS: There's floor. Stone floor. A little
dusty.

1792
01:44:42,112 --> 01:44:50,546
SAM: All right. What's that thing at the far side
of it? Is that a chest? That's an open chest,

1793
01:44:50,546 --> 01:44:51,414
isn't it?

1794
01:44:51,414 --> 01:44:52,963
TRAVIS: It does appear-- Yeah.

1795
01:44:52,963 --> 01:44:54,782
SAM: I go look in the open chest.

1796
01:44:54,782 --> 01:44:58,937
TRAVIS: Okay. You go and look in the chest. It is
an empty chest.

1797
01:44:58,937 --> 01:45:02,089
SAM: Nothing's here, someone's been through here
already.

1798
01:45:02,089 --> 01:45:05,781
LIAM: It's been about three minutes, I'd like to
use another action to face the same direction as

1799
01:45:05,781 --> 01:45:07,258
everyone else.

1800
01:45:07,258 --> 01:45:10,508
TRAVIS: Roll a dexterity check.

1801
01:45:10,508 --> 01:45:16,212
LIAM: Okay. The boots have worn off, so I can only
roll this ball once. It's not very good.

1802
01:45:16,212 --> 01:45:17,420
LAURA: Oh no, that's terrible.

1803
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:18,333
LIAM: 14.

1804
01:45:18,333 --> 01:45:22,372
TRAVIS: In your effort to turn, you slip and you
catch yourself, and you face the same way as

1805
01:45:22,372 --> 01:45:24,029
everyone else. Well done.

1806
01:45:24,029 --> 01:45:26,212
LAURA: Yay. Can I walk up to the door in front of us?

1807
01:45:26,212 --> 01:45:27,746
TRAVIS: Sure. Directly in front of you?

1808
01:45:27,819 --> 01:45:28,526
LAURA: Yeah.

1809
01:45:28,526 --> 01:45:30,102
TRAVIS: You walk up.

1810
01:45:30,102 --> 01:45:32,551
TALIESIN: I want to take a look at the square, if
that's all right.

1811
01:45:32,551 --> 01:45:34,251
TRAVIS: Percy, you go up to the square.

1812
01:45:34,251 --> 01:45:37,448
SAM: There's nothing in this one, guys.

1813
01:45:37,448 --> 01:45:41,059
LAURA: Well, maybe there's one in the room with
the-- Is that a money symbol?

1814
01:45:41,059 --> 01:45:44,313
TRAVIS: It does appear to be a money symbol.

1815
01:45:44,313 --> 01:45:46,267
LAURA: Can I go in the money room?

1816
01:45:46,267 --> 01:45:49,336
TRAVIS: Would you like to try and open the door?

1817
01:45:49,336 --> 01:45:50,461
LAURA: Yeah!

1818
01:45:50,461 --> 01:45:51,852
TRAVIS: You go to the door.

1819
01:45:51,852 --> 01:45:53,087
LAURA: Yeah.

1820
01:45:53,087 --> 01:45:54,426
TRAVIS: Doesn't seem to open.

1821
01:45:54,426 --> 01:45:55,853
LAURA: Is it locked?

1822
01:45:55,853 --> 01:46:00,745
SAM: Maybe the symbols correspond to us. The star
being me, because I'm the star. Money for you,

1823
01:46:00,745 --> 01:46:04,849
because you're greedy. The square for Vax, because
he's a square.

1824
01:46:04,849 --> 01:46:07,416
TALIESIN: It could be money for me, because I have
it.

1825
01:46:07,416 --> 01:46:09,789
LAURA: Well, I have it now too, darling.

1826
01:46:09,789 --> 01:46:14,086
TALIESIN: That is fair, we actually both have it
at this point. I'm going to try my door, the

1827
01:46:14,086 --> 01:46:15,148
square.

1828
01:46:15,148 --> 01:46:18,011
LAURA: Maybe a circle for Percy, because there's a
circle on his glasses.

1829
01:46:18,011 --> 01:46:23,051
TRAVIS: Percy goes and reaches out, tries the
handle. Door doesn't seem to open. You do notice,

1830
01:46:23,051 --> 01:46:28,978
there's not just the handle, there seem to be five
inlaid gems above the handle.

1831
01:46:28,978 --> 01:46:31,304
TALIESIN: What sort of five inlaid gems?

1832
01:46:31,304 --> 01:46:33,600
TRAVIS: They're fucking gems.

1833
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:38,166
LAURA: Five gems on each door, or five gems, one
gem on each door?

1834
01:46:38,166 --> 01:46:42,135
TRAVIS: Five gems above the handle, they're all
very shiny.

1835
01:46:42,135 --> 01:46:43,488
LIAM: Circle door.

1836
01:46:43,488 --> 01:46:46,467
SAM: Are there any gems on my door, or are they
all gold?

1837
01:46:46,467 --> 01:46:51,443
TRAVIS: In fact, as you all communicate with each
other, these doors seem to be identical. A handle

1838
01:46:51,443 --> 01:46:57,653
with five gems above each handle, and one of the
gems seems to be glowing.

1839
01:46:57,653 --> 01:46:59,717
LAURA: Can I push on the glowing gem?

1840
01:46:59,717 --> 01:47:01,457
TRAVIS: Nothing happens.

1841
01:47:01,457 --> 01:47:03,400
LAURA: Can I push on all the other ones?

1842
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:08,255
TRAVIS: Nothing seems to happen when you push on
the gems.

1843
01:47:08,255 --> 01:47:10,229
LAURA: Can I pull the glowing one out?

1844
01:47:10,229 --> 01:47:15,908
TRAVIS: It's inlaid in the wall, it's just
attached. As you're all examining your doors, you

1845
01:47:15,908 --> 01:47:28,157
hear a sound, almost like a grunt. Vex, behind
you, you hear a sound.

1846
01:47:28,157 --> 01:47:30,753
SAM: Almost like a grunt.

1847
01:47:30,753 --> 01:47:33,998
TRAVIS: Almost like a wicked grunt.

1848
01:47:33,998 --> 01:47:36,608
LAURA: Is it Grog? Is Grog farting behind me?

1849
01:47:36,608 --> 01:47:43,488
TRAVIS: No. You hear footsteps walk up behind you,
as a fist grabs the back of your neck and

1850
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:54,178
slams your face into the door. Grog seemingly has
changed into some sort of other creature.

1851
01:47:54,178 --> 01:47:55,954
LAURA: What is that thing?

1852
01:47:55,954 --> 01:47:58,991
LIAM: I know what that is. But that's Liam, not
Vax.

1853
01:47:58,991 --> 01:48:00,355
TRAVIS: That's a natural 20.

1854
01:48:00,355 --> 01:48:01,654
LAURA: You rolled a natural 20 against me?

1855
01:48:01,654 --> 01:48:15,295
TRAVIS: I actually did, which is shocking. You
take 19 points of bludgeoning damage.

1856
01:48:15,295 --> 01:48:18,104
LAURA: Oh. Fuck you.

1857
01:48:18,104 --> 01:48:20,005
TRAVIS: Do you turn around and face your
attacker?

1858
01:48:20,005 --> 01:48:21,257
LAURA: Yeah.

1859
01:48:21,257 --> 01:48:27,022
TRAVIS: There's a fucking doppelgänger behind you.
This amorphous, shapeless creature has come up

1860
01:48:27,022 --> 01:48:29,587
behind you and is trying to attack.

1861
01:48:29,587 --> 01:48:32,822
LAURA: Is it trying to be like me? Is it going to
take the shape of me?

1862
01:48:32,822 --> 01:48:34,152
TRAVIS: I don't know, he's just back there.

1863
01:48:34,152 --> 01:48:35,630
LAURA: Trinket runs up and attacks him from the
other--

1864
01:48:35,630 --> 01:48:38,982
TRAVIS: He makes another attack before you have a
chance to communicate with your bear.

1865
01:48:38,982 --> 01:48:40,666
LIAM: Yeah, they're very fisty.

1866
01:48:40,666 --> 01:48:45,227
TRAVIS: That's a natural one. He misses. He swings
forward with his other hand and takes a chip out

1867
01:48:45,227 --> 01:48:46,712
of the door.

1868
01:48:46,712 --> 01:48:52,758
LAURA: Right. Trinket runs up behind him. I
Hunter's Mark him, and Trinket bites him.

1869
01:48:52,758 --> 01:48:54,466
TRAVIS: He bites him?

1870
01:48:54,466 --> 01:48:55,372
LAURA: Yeah.

1871
01:48:55,372 --> 01:48:57,437
TRAVIS: Roll to attack. Oh God.

1872
01:48:57,437 --> 01:49:00,071
LAURA: Natural 20!

1873
01:49:00,071 --> 01:49:01,964
LIAM: Ooh, Trinket is killing it!

1874
01:49:01,964 --> 01:49:04,478
LAURA: Oh. Why doesn't he do this in real life?

1875
01:49:04,478 --> 01:49:06,769
TRAVIS: I don't know.

1876
01:49:06,769 --> 01:49:08,132
LIAM: Irony.

1877
01:49:08,132 --> 01:49:11,621
LAURA: Ten. 19.

1878
01:49:11,621 --> 01:49:13,532
TRAVIS: 19 damage?

1879
01:49:13,532 --> 01:49:14,882
LAURA: 19 damage.

1880
01:49:14,882 --> 01:49:16,614
LIAM: Na-na-na-na-na-na.

1881
01:49:16,614 --> 01:49:18,463
LAURA: Na-na-na-na-nineteen.

1882
01:49:18,463 --> 01:49:23,108
TRAVIS: He takes a bite out, and you see like a
purplish blood start to pour from this wound, and

1883
01:49:23,108 --> 01:49:25,070
he takes a big bite out of him.

1884
01:49:25,070 --> 01:49:33,901
LAURA: Okay. Then <i>I</i> am going to, for <i>my</i>
attack, use my Rope of Entanglement on the

1885
01:49:33,901 --> 01:49:35,299
doppelgänger.

1886
01:49:35,299 --> 01:49:36,319
TRAVIS: You are very close.

1887
01:49:36,319 --> 01:49:37,175
LAURA: Yeah.

1888
01:49:37,175 --> 01:49:38,308
TRAVIS: Okay.

1889
01:49:38,308 --> 01:49:42,426
SAM: Was Grog always a doppelgänger?

1890
01:49:42,426 --> 01:49:44,349
LAURA: Is Grog a doppelgänger?

1891
01:49:44,349 --> 01:49:46,020
TRAVIS: Make a strength check.

1892
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:47,362
LIAM: You don't know.

1893
01:49:47,362 --> 01:49:50,573
TALIESIN: He may have been. We don't know.

1894
01:49:50,573 --> 01:49:51,853
LIAM: We don't know.

1895
01:49:51,853 --> 01:49:54,198
TALIESIN: We've all got a Grog we don't know
about.

1896
01:49:54,198 --> 01:49:56,157
LAURA: Strength. 16.

1897
01:49:56,157 --> 01:50:03,774
TRAVIS: 16. Unfortunately, the rope goes over and
he just shakes it off, just slips the rope.

1898
01:50:03,774 --> 01:50:05,370
LAURA: Aww, that's bullshit.

1899
01:50:05,370 --> 01:50:07,107
TRAVIS: Yeah, well he's a tricky one, this guy.

1900
01:50:07,107 --> 01:50:09,348
TALIESIN: I want to start running towards where
this commotion is.

1901
01:50:09,348 --> 01:50:10,717
LIAM: Yeah, I'm right around the corner.

1902
01:50:10,717 --> 01:50:12,383
TRAVIS: Is there a commotion? Did she call out?

1903
01:50:12,383 --> 01:50:13,705
TALIESIN: Did you call out?

1904
01:50:13,705 --> 01:50:17,567
LIAM: We didn't hear oof, aaf, or the bear going
(growling)?

1905
01:50:17,567 --> 01:50:21,195
TRAVIS: I mean, you seem to be pretty preoccupied
with these doors in front of you.

1906
01:50:21,195 --> 01:50:24,504
SAM: I'm looking at a ficus in my room. Seems
nice.

1907
01:50:24,504 --> 01:50:27,130
TRAVIS: He will take another swing at you.

1908
01:50:27,130 --> 01:50:28,253
LAURA: No!

1909
01:50:28,253 --> 01:50:30,843
LIAM: I feel like my twin sense would have kicked
in.

1910
01:50:30,843 --> 01:50:35,430
TRAVIS: Probably. It's a little delayed right now.
You keep tripping over everything.

1911
01:50:35,430 --> 01:50:37,330
TRAVIS: 16.

1912
01:50:37,330 --> 01:50:39,530
LAURA: 16 to hit? Doesn't hit me.

1913
01:50:39,530 --> 01:50:43,964
TRAVIS: He misses on the first one. Shit. 13.

1914
01:50:43,964 --> 01:50:47,198
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to kick him in the crotch!

1915
01:50:47,198 --> 01:50:49,353
TRAVIS: Roll to attack.

1916
01:50:49,353 --> 01:50:58,685
LAURA: I don't want to use that one. I'll use this
one. That's terrible. Wait, what do I add? Is this

1917
01:50:58,685 --> 01:50:59,957
just a regular attack?

1918
01:50:59,957 --> 01:51:02,194
TRAVIS: Yeah, just a straight roll with your
strength modifier.

1919
01:51:02,194 --> 01:51:05,480
LAURA: Oh, well, that would be a two.

1920
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:12,783
TRAVIS: That misses. You go to kick and he just
like Jean Claude Van Damme jump splits. And then

1921
01:51:12,783 --> 01:51:14,182
comes right back down.

1922
01:51:14,182 --> 01:51:17,485
LAURA: Okay. Shit. Trinket's going to attack him.

1923
01:51:17,485 --> 01:51:18,649
TRAVIS: Okay.

1924
01:51:18,649 --> 01:51:26,222
LAURA: He's going to bite him. So that is 25 for
Trinket.

1925
01:51:26,222 --> 01:51:27,638
TRAVIS: That'll hit.

1926
01:51:27,638 --> 01:51:31,027
LAURA: 12!

1927
01:51:31,027 --> 01:51:32,808
TRAVIS: 12 points of damage?

1928
01:51:32,808 --> 01:51:33,712
LAURA: Yes.

1929
01:51:33,712 --> 01:51:35,743
TRAVIS: Okay. He's still up.

1930
01:51:35,743 --> 01:51:39,842
LAURA: I'm going to go "Doppeljenga!"

1931
01:51:39,842 --> 01:51:41,613
TRAVIS: Doppeljenga?

1932
01:51:41,613 --> 01:51:42,774
LAURA: Yes.

1933
01:51:42,774 --> 01:51:45,936
TRAVIS: You all hear "doppeljenga!" What would
you like to do?

1934
01:51:45,936 --> 01:51:47,714
LIAM: I'm running towards the sound of the sister.

1935
01:51:47,714 --> 01:51:52,174
TRAVIS: Fair enough. Vax comes charging around the
corner. Percy comes skipping around the corner.

1936
01:51:52,174 --> 01:51:53,813
TALIESIN: Yes, right there.

1937
01:51:53,813 --> 01:52:03,092
TRAVIS: Beautiful. The doppelganger will take one
more swipe at you. Yeah, he's just furious. 23.

1938
01:52:03,092 --> 01:52:04,809
LAURA: Ooh, that hit me.

1939
01:52:04,809 --> 01:52:06,258
TRAVIS: That'll hit.

1940
01:52:06,258 --> 01:52:07,815
LIAM: (growling)

1941
01:52:07,815 --> 01:52:09,930
LAURA: What are these weird sounds coming from
you?

1942
01:52:09,930 --> 01:52:12,460
LIAM: It's not coming from me at all, you're just
imagining it in your brain.

1943
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:14,215
TRAVIS: You take 14 points of bludgeoning damage.

1944
01:52:14,215 --> 01:52:15,507
LAURA: Fuck. All right.

1945
01:52:15,507 --> 01:52:17,834
TRAVIS: Yep. Vax. You get there quick.

1946
01:52:17,834 --> 01:52:27,193
LIAM: Okay so I'm going to throw Whisper and bamf
to this motherfucker. At advantage. I'm getting

1947
01:52:27,193 --> 01:52:29,545
the hang of this. That's a 28 to hit.

1948
01:52:29,545 --> 01:52:30,918
TRAVIS: That'll hit.

1949
01:52:30,918 --> 01:52:36,923
LIAM: Okay. Where the fuck is the four-- there it
is. (counting)

1950
01:52:36,923 --> 01:52:44,205
LAURA: 52 points of damage so far. Fuck. Kill
him!

1951
01:52:44,205 --> 01:52:56,111
LIAM: 44 for the first and a paladin attack, we'll
go attack attack and I'll use my bonus action to

1952
01:52:56,111 --> 01:52:57,655
attack--

1953
01:52:57,655 --> 01:52:59,951
TRAVIS: I will say because you and Percy were
up at the same time you get one attack.

1954
01:52:59,951 --> 01:53:00,835
LIAM: One attack?

1955
01:53:00,835 --> 01:53:01,832
TRAVIS: One attack.

1956
01:53:01,832 --> 01:53:10,233
LIAM: Well that's how Flungeons and Kragens work.
So one more attack. That is a 25 to hit.

1957
01:53:10,233 --> 01:53:11,358
TRAVIS: It hits.

1958
01:53:11,358 --> 01:53:14,860
LIAM: Which is a little bit less. That's a seven.

1959
01:53:14,860 --> 01:53:16,104
TRAVIS: A seven?

1960
01:53:16,104 --> 01:53:17,056
LIAM: Yeah.

1961
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:18,133
LAURA: Just a little less.

1962
01:53:18,133 --> 01:53:27,958
TRAVIS: Yeah. Got it. All right. Percy, you may do
whatever you want. He is bleeding a bunch.

1963
01:53:27,958 --> 01:53:31,172
LAURA: Ooh, maybe just flick him in the forehead.

1964
01:53:31,172 --> 01:53:35,472
TALIESIN: I'm just going to walk up and slap him
with the glove.

1965
01:53:35,472 --> 01:53:36,533
LIAM: Yes.

1966
01:53:36,533 --> 01:53:37,353
TRAVIS: Just a slap?

1967
01:53:37,353 --> 01:53:38,380
TALIESIN: I'm just going to do a slap.

1968
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:39,808
SAM: Insult his honor?

1969
01:53:39,808 --> 01:53:41,158
TRAVIS: A regular glove or with--?

1970
01:53:41,158 --> 01:53:48,923
TALIESIN: Oh no, with my fancy glove. I'm going to
use the fancy glove. Let's see, where is that?

1971
01:53:48,923 --> 01:53:51,312
TRAVIS: How about you roll an attack and add your
strength modifier?

1972
01:53:51,312 --> 01:53:52,673
TALIESIN: Oh no, there's actually a thing for
this.

1973
01:53:52,673 --> 01:53:53,499
TRAVIS: Oh, is there?

1974
01:53:53,499 --> 01:53:55,095
TALIESIN: Yeah, oh yeah, I have numbers.

1975
01:53:55,095 --> 01:53:57,150
SAM: This is his electric glove.

1976
01:53:57,150 --> 01:53:59,576
TALIESIN: 23 to hit.

1977
01:53:59,576 --> 01:54:00,629
TRAVIS: That hits, yes.

1978
01:54:00,629 --> 01:54:14,064
TALIESIN: And that's 14 points of damage and then
he has to make a constitution save or he's

1979
01:54:14,064 --> 01:54:15,136
stunned.

1980
01:54:15,136 --> 01:54:18,916
TRAVIS: He doesn't need to make a constitution
saving throw because you slap him and his lower

1981
01:54:18,916 --> 01:54:21,003
jaw just flies off of his face.

1982
01:54:21,003 --> 01:54:22,927
TALIESIN: That's very, very pleasing.

1983
01:54:22,927 --> 01:54:30,236
TRAVIS: It just sprays purple gore all over Vex
and Vax. Just this snowcone of gore.

1984
01:54:30,236 --> 01:54:31,961
TALIESIN: Is there none on Trinket? Is Trinket--

1985
01:54:31,961 --> 01:54:35,451
TRAVIS: No, the way you came up and smacked him he
went that way and Trinket was like "Yeah, nicely

1986
01:54:35,451 --> 01:54:45,009
"done." You have removed this doppelganger. So Grog
has been removed from your party.

1987
01:54:45,009 --> 01:54:47,844
LAURA: What? Grog's been a doppelganger this
entire time?

1988
01:54:47,844 --> 01:54:49,367
TRAVIS: It seems to be.

1989
01:54:49,367 --> 01:54:54,502
SAM: Scanlan falls to his knees, feeling
a great pain in his soul. A hollowness that wasn't

1990
01:54:54,502 --> 01:54:55,626
there before.

1991
01:54:55,626 --> 01:54:57,797
TALIESIN: Oh god, Scanlan's another doppleganger,
quick, kill him.

1992
01:54:57,797 --> 01:55:02,628
SAM: I can't believe I lost me mate. What what?

1993
01:55:02,628 --> 01:55:05,097
TRAVIS: Yep, good.

1994
01:55:05,097 --> 01:55:07,387
SAM: Do I get any XP for that?

1995
01:55:07,387 --> 01:55:14,104
TRAVIS: Nope. You are now wrestling with the loss
of clearly your favorite and strongest party

1996
01:55:14,104 --> 01:55:18,178
member. And we will take a break at this moment.

1997
01:55:18,178 --> 01:55:20,343
(yelling)

1998
01:55:20,343 --> 01:55:22,173
LIAM: This is the most fun game!

1999
01:55:22,173 --> 01:55:24,039
LAURA: Oh good, we can eat our sherbet. Or whatever
it is that we got.

2000
01:55:24,039 --> 01:55:26,334
TALIESIN: I think it was pomegranate sherbet.

2001
01:55:26,334 --> 01:55:32,366
TRAVIS: We will return in a moment. I wanted to
thank also Kristen Mack made this wood burned DM's

2002
01:55:32,366 --> 01:55:34,973
screen. Which is super, super impressive.

2003
01:55:34,973 --> 01:55:38,243
LAURA: Who made all those little stick figure
drawings?

2004
01:55:38,243 --> 01:55:39,674
TRAVIS: This is actually Arcade.

2005
01:55:39,674 --> 01:55:40,741
LAURA: Really?

2006
01:55:40,741 --> 01:55:41,731
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2007
01:55:41,731 --> 01:55:43,037
LAURA: Aww, that's awesome.

2008
01:55:43,037 --> 01:55:51,697
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's amazing. We will be giving away
this amazing black walnut hero vault which will be

2009
01:55:51,697 --> 01:55:58,892
signed by the cast. And the word-- am I doing this
right?-- in the chat is Regerts.

2010
01:55:58,892 --> 01:56:00,262
LIAM: Regerts?

2011
01:56:00,262 --> 01:56:01,439
LAURA: Regerts! No regerts!

2012
01:56:01,439 --> 01:56:02,532
LIAM: Can you spell Regerts?

2013
01:56:02,532 --> 01:56:13,429
TRAVIS: Just regerts. R-E-G-E-R-T-S. So "regerts"
to win this amazing Wyrmwood dice vault. And we

2014
01:56:13,429 --> 01:56:15,536
will be back in a moment.

2015
01:56:15,536 --> 01:56:17,869
LAURA: Oh my goodness!

2016
01:56:17,869 --> 02:14:55,497
[break]

2017
02:14:55,497 --> 02:14:59,586
TRAVIS: Welcome back. That's my best Mercer. Is
that--?

2018
02:14:59,586 --> 02:15:01,184
LAURA: Oh, yeah!

2019
02:15:01,184 --> 02:15:10,476
TRAVIS: We did have a winner in La Chaté. The
winner is Avarlic. Or, Ava Rolic. A-V-A-R-L-I-C.

2020
02:15:10,476 --> 02:15:15,796
Congratulations, you are winning this gorgeous
Walnut Hero Vault. Signed by all of us at

2021
02:15:15,796 --> 02:15:18,783
Critical Role.

2022
02:15:18,783 --> 02:15:20,513
LAURA: Yay.

2023
02:15:20,513 --> 02:15:27,864
TRAVIS: Let's get back
in. So one quick note. I got a little confused,

2024
02:15:27,864 --> 02:15:35,493
actually. When Vex strode up to this door that had
the money symbol on it, and she placed her hand

2025
02:15:35,493 --> 02:15:43,334
on the handle, one of those inlaid gems of the
five lit up. So now there are two lit up gems in

2026
02:15:43,334 --> 02:15:44,532
the door.

2027
02:15:44,532 --> 02:15:51,702
LAURA: Ooh. That's probably important. I wonder if
we touch it too many times without knowing what

2028
02:15:51,702 --> 02:15:54,655
we're supposed to do if they, like, explode, and
then we can't open it at all.

2029
02:15:54,655 --> 02:15:58,466
TALIESIN: I think all of us have to be touching
one of the doors at the same time. We should

2030
02:15:58,466 --> 02:15:59,482
surround the tower.

2031
02:15:59,482 --> 02:16:00,717
SAM: Wait, it's still glowing now, right?

2032
02:16:00,717 --> 02:16:03,918
TRAVIS: As she's holding it, it's, yeah.

2033
02:16:03,918 --> 02:16:06,281
LAURA: Oh, but all of us reach for a door at the
same time!

2034
02:16:06,281 --> 02:16:09,140
TALIESIN: Yes, let's all go and touch doors.

2035
02:16:09,140 --> 02:16:12,868
LAURA: What about Scanlan's door? Are there any
jewels lit up on your door?

2036
02:16:12,868 --> 02:16:16,706
SAM: The same two jewels are lit up on mine.

2037
02:16:16,706 --> 02:16:18,466
LAURA: Really?

2038
02:16:18,466 --> 02:16:20,191
SAM: Is that true?

2039
02:16:20,191 --> 02:16:27,057
TRAVIS: Actually, in your door, all the jewels,
they are not lit up. But if you explore other doors.

2040
02:16:27,057 --> 02:16:28,432
LIAM: Scanlan?

2041
02:16:28,432 --> 02:16:29,431
SAM: Oi.

2042
02:16:29,431 --> 02:16:30,832
LIAM: No, not Scanlan. Scanlan.

2043
02:16:30,832 --> 02:16:31,813
SAM: Right.

2044
02:16:31,813 --> 02:16:34,510
LIAM: I'm out of vegan wine. Could you get some
more vegan wine in, please?

2045
02:16:34,510 --> 02:16:39,445
SAM: Servants. Continue the creepy music and bring
us more wine, please.

2046
02:16:39,445 --> 02:16:42,171
LIAM: Thank you.

2047
02:16:42,171 --> 02:16:45,219
TRAVIS: The more you drink, the better you play.

2048
02:16:45,219 --> 02:16:46,433
LAURA: Yeah.

2049
02:16:46,433 --> 02:16:49,485
SAM: Are you sure we shouldn't go wake up the
others upstairs?

2050
02:16:49,485 --> 02:16:52,829
TRAVIS: No, we're too far in it now. We've formed
an elite group here.

2051
02:16:52,829 --> 02:16:57,620
SAM: I guess it's not the others. It's just Pike,
because Keyleth is dead.

2052
02:16:57,620 --> 02:17:00,708
LAURA: Well, no. No, Keyleth is dead in the game.

2053
02:17:00,708 --> 02:17:02,171
SAM: No, she's really dead.

2054
02:17:02,171 --> 02:17:08,348
LAURA: So all of us should touch a door at the
same time. Yes?

2055
02:17:08,348 --> 02:17:09,829
TALIESIN: I'm going to touch a door.

2056
02:17:09,829 --> 02:17:11,031
LAURA: Wait, at the same time.

2057
02:17:11,031 --> 02:17:13,519
TALIESIN: Well, since you're already touching a
door, I'm going to touch the next door.

2058
02:17:13,519 --> 02:17:17,694
LAURA: I'm not touching it yet. I let go of it,
because I got attacked by a doppelganger.

2059
02:17:17,694 --> 02:17:19,304
TALIESIN: Well, then I'll go touch--

2060
02:17:19,304 --> 02:17:20,648
TRAVIS: Did you let go of the door?

2061
02:17:20,648 --> 02:17:21,790
LAURA: Did I?

2062
02:17:21,790 --> 02:17:23,010
TRAVIS: Did you?

2063
02:17:23,010 --> 02:17:24,804
LAURA: I did. Well, I was getting attacked, so I'm
assuming.

2064
02:17:24,804 --> 02:17:26,812
LIAM: You were dealing with a melted humanoid.

2065
02:17:26,812 --> 02:17:28,988
TRAVIS: Would you like to grab the handle again?

2066
02:17:28,988 --> 02:17:30,882
LAURA: I'm going to wait until other people grab
their handles.

2067
02:17:30,882 --> 02:17:32,091
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

2068
02:17:32,091 --> 02:17:33,712
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to go back to my
square.

2069
02:17:33,712 --> 02:17:35,229
LAURA: And then all of us can time it.

2070
02:17:35,229 --> 02:17:38,658
LIAM: I'll go to my circle. Circle door.

2071
02:17:38,658 --> 02:17:41,151
LAURA: So Scanlan should go to the triangle.

2072
02:17:41,151 --> 02:17:43,797
TALIESIN: ("Scanlan" voice) Go to the triangle, Scanlan.

2073
02:17:43,797 --> 02:17:46,646
SAM: What is that stupid voice you're using?

2074
02:17:46,646 --> 02:17:49,308
TALIESIN: That's you, that's what you sound like.
All the time.

2075
02:17:49,308 --> 02:17:52,237
SAM: No, my character in the game talks like
this.

2076
02:17:52,237 --> 02:17:54,750
TALIESIN: Your character in the game talks a bit
stupid.

2077
02:17:54,750 --> 02:17:57,525
SAM: Yeah. All right, on the count of three.

2078
02:17:57,525 --> 02:18:00,705
LIAM: You are a world-class performer.

2079
02:18:00,705 --> 02:18:03,201
LAURA: Do we touch it on three, or do we touch it
after three?

2080
02:18:03,201 --> 02:18:04,758
SAM: I'm representing my character!

2081
02:18:04,758 --> 02:18:06,622
LAURA: On three, or after three?

2082
02:18:06,622 --> 02:18:08,801
SAM: On three! On three!

2083
02:18:08,801 --> 02:18:10,213
LAURA: All right.

2084
02:18:10,213 --> 02:18:12,177
LIAM: On free? Three or free?

2085
02:18:12,177 --> 02:18:13,351
TALIESIN: Not on four.

2086
02:18:13,351 --> 02:18:14,507
SAM: Free.

2087
02:18:14,507 --> 02:18:16,038
LAURA: One. Two.

2088
02:18:16,038 --> 02:18:17,484
EVERYONE: Three.

2089
02:18:17,484 --> 02:18:24,182
TRAVIS: You grab the handles, and you see as three
gems light up while two do not.

2090
02:18:24,182 --> 02:18:31,669
SAM: We've got the wrong doors. We got the wrong
doors! Yours is correct, Vex, because you are

2091
02:18:31,669 --> 02:18:32,810
greedy.

2092
02:18:32,810 --> 02:18:34,695
LAURA: Yeah, ooh. Okay.

2093
02:18:34,695 --> 02:18:36,724
SAM: I'm a cube. I'm a cube.

2094
02:18:36,724 --> 02:18:39,362
LAURA: Oh, you're a cube! Because you've got a
dick that's a cube!

2095
02:18:39,362 --> 02:18:40,670
SAM: Switch with me, Percy!

2096
02:18:40,670 --> 02:18:41,769
TALIESIN: I'll switch with you, that's fine.

2097
02:18:41,769 --> 02:18:43,825
LIAM: That makes sense, that makes sense.

2098
02:18:43,825 --> 02:18:46,605
LAURA: And maybe Vax is--

2099
02:18:46,605 --> 02:18:50,617
TRAVIS: Three of the five gems lit up.

2100
02:18:50,617 --> 02:18:53,478
LAURA: --a triangle, because he stabs.

2101
02:18:53,478 --> 02:18:57,638
LIAM: Dagger, dagger, dagger? Maybe three daggers?
Three sides? Let's try it.

2102
02:18:57,638 --> 02:19:01,729
LAURA: Percy, you have circle glasses, right, that
could be something.

2103
02:19:01,729 --> 02:19:03,163
TALIESIN: I do have circle glasses.

2104
02:19:03,163 --> 02:19:06,652
LIAM: Well, it matches the symbol for your home a
little bit.

2105
02:19:06,652 --> 02:19:08,153
SAM: Oh, the de Rolo!

2106
02:19:08,153 --> 02:19:12,767
LIAM: De Roll-o. That's what it was all along.

2107
02:19:12,767 --> 02:19:20,173
TALIESIN: Oh my god, I've never heard that before.
No one has never made that joke. I can't imagine

2108
02:19:20,173 --> 02:19:21,909
I've been going my entire life.

2109
02:19:21,909 --> 02:19:24,782
LIAM: You are the richest, most powerful people in
town. Who is looking down on you?

2110
02:19:24,782 --> 02:19:25,826
LAURA: One. Two.

2111
02:19:25,826 --> 02:19:27,501
ALL: Three.

2112
02:19:27,501 --> 02:19:29,710
TRAVIS: All five gems light up.

2113
02:19:29,710 --> 02:19:31,731
LAURA: We're so smart!

2114
02:19:31,731 --> 02:19:35,661
TRAVIS: You hear a lock release, and the door,
with the weight of your hand on it, starts to

2115
02:19:35,661 --> 02:19:37,019
swing open.

2116
02:19:37,019 --> 02:19:39,035
LAURA: I go in. Is there a chest?

2117
02:19:39,035 --> 02:19:40,344
TRAVIS: You just walk in?

2118
02:19:40,344 --> 02:19:42,758
LAURA: I check for traps?

2119
02:19:42,758 --> 02:19:45,537
TRAVIS: Roll an investigation check.

2120
02:19:45,537 --> 02:19:46,483
LAURA: Okay.

2121
02:19:46,483 --> 02:19:48,226
SAM: What are you drinking, piss? What is that?

2122
02:19:48,226 --> 02:19:49,404
TRAVIS: Apple juice.

2123
02:19:49,404 --> 02:19:50,812
SAM: Oh. That's a lot of apple juice.

2124
02:19:50,812 --> 02:19:51,797
TRAVIS: Yeah, man.

2125
02:19:51,797 --> 02:19:53,680
SAM: I don't think I've drank that much apple
juice since I was eight.

2126
02:19:53,680 --> 02:19:55,440
TRAVIS: Yeah, well, I'm kind of doing Grog.

2127
02:19:55,440 --> 02:19:57,343
LAURA: 14.

2128
02:19:57,343 --> 02:20:05,103
TRAVIS: 14. You look around the room. You see no
traps. Doesn't seem to be trapped in any way.

2129
02:20:05,103 --> 02:20:08,386
LAURA: What about the chest? Is it trapped?

2130
02:20:08,386 --> 02:20:13,504
TRAVIS: Would you like to check the chest for
traps? Roll an investigation check.

2131
02:20:13,504 --> 02:20:17,920
LAURA: 18.

2132
02:20:17,920 --> 02:20:20,283
TRAVIS: 18. Does not appear to be trapped.

2133
02:20:20,283 --> 02:20:21,769
LAURA: Can I open it?

2134
02:20:21,769 --> 02:20:23,986
TRAVIS: You can. The chest opens.

2135
02:20:23,986 --> 02:20:27,333
LAURA: Oh, is it a mimic or is it a chest?

2136
02:20:27,333 --> 02:20:33,155
TRAVIS: No, you open it, and inside you see a
small vial with a little liquid.

2137
02:20:33,265 --> 02:20:34,751
LAURA: What's it look like?

2138
02:20:34,751 --> 02:20:37,028
TRAVIS: It looks like a greater healing potion.

2139
02:20:37,028 --> 02:20:42,761
LAURA: Oh. Okay. What's that circle on the table
behind me?

2140
02:20:42,761 --> 02:20:47,830
TRAVIS: During your investigation check of the
room, you see the rug, the potted plant, the

2141
02:20:47,830 --> 02:20:55,211
chest, the desk and the chair. You also see above
you, in the ceiling, it seems to be a hatch above

2142
02:20:55,211 --> 02:20:57,389
you. An iron hatch in the ceiling.

2143
02:20:57,389 --> 02:21:02,868
LAURA: Is it bars or is it solid?

2144
02:21:02,868 --> 02:21:05,274
TRAVIS: Solid plate metal.

2145
02:21:05,274 --> 02:21:10,546
TALIESIN: I will go into my room. Check for traps,
check underneath the carpet, check the desk for

2146
02:21:10,546 --> 02:21:12,933
anything interesting and then I'm going to open my
chest.

2147
02:21:12,933 --> 02:21:14,817
TRAVIS: Okay. Roll an investigation.

2148
02:21:14,817 --> 02:21:16,275
TALIESIN: I will.

2149
02:21:16,275 --> 02:21:18,077
LAURA: I took my potion, right?

2150
02:21:18,077 --> 02:21:20,365
TALIESIN: That's terrible. Eight.

2151
02:21:20,365 --> 02:21:26,167
TRAVIS: Eight. You look under the rug. There is
nothing under the rug. You don't see any immediate

2152
02:21:26,167 --> 02:21:33,078
traps. You go over to check the desk. Nothing
seems to be wrong with the desk. However, as you

2153
02:21:33,078 --> 02:21:43,373
are checking your desk for traps, you feel the
slashing whip of twigs and thorns across your back

2154
02:21:43,373 --> 02:21:49,357
as this twig blight has come across the room and
attacks you from behind.

2155
02:21:49,357 --> 02:21:50,848
LIAM: It's a tree creature.

2156
02:21:50,848 --> 02:21:55,175
TALIESIN: I'm going to turn around and start
slashing at it with my sword.

2157
02:21:55,175 --> 02:21:58,049
TRAVIS: Fair enough. Hold on, he attacks first.

2158
02:21:58,049 --> 02:21:59,368
TALIESIN: Yes, that's fair.

2159
02:21:59,368 --> 02:22:00,339
TRAVIS: A 21.

2160
02:22:00,339 --> 02:22:01,322
TALIESIN: That hits.

2161
02:22:01,322 --> 02:22:02,351
TRAVIS: It does hit?!

2162
02:22:02,351 --> 02:22:03,655
TALIESIN: Yeah, 21 hits. Yes.

2163
02:22:03,655 --> 02:22:05,960
TRAVIS: That is surprising. You're going to take a
whopping--

2164
02:22:05,960 --> 02:22:09,283
SAM: Grog, what is with your voice?

2165
02:22:09,283 --> 02:22:15,708
TRAVIS: A whopping five points of piercing
damage.

2166
02:22:15,708 --> 02:22:18,104
TALIESIN: Five points of piercing damage. All
right.

2167
02:22:18,104 --> 02:22:22,542
TRAVIS: It's very hard to sustain this
personality.

2168
02:22:22,542 --> 02:22:25,527
SAM: What are you talking about?!

2169
02:22:25,527 --> 02:22:27,845
TRAVIS: You turn and you start slashing.

2170
02:22:27,845 --> 02:22:32,105
TALIESIN: I'm going to make three quick slashes
with my sword.

2171
02:22:32,105 --> 02:22:34,222
LIAM: It's like a medium pain reaction.

2172
02:22:34,222 --> 02:22:36,078
TRAVIS: Can you give me an ABC?

2173
02:22:36,078 --> 02:22:38,486
TALIESIN: Oh my god. Two natural 20s.

2174
02:22:38,486 --> 02:22:40,239
TRAVIS and LIAM: Ooh!

2175
02:22:40,239 --> 02:22:44,167
TALIESIN: And a 21.

2176
02:22:44,167 --> 02:22:50,439
TRAVIS: Your might is clearly on display in this
visceral and violent outburst.

2177
02:22:50,439 --> 02:22:58,349
TALIESIN: I'm attempting to carve it into a shape,
so I'm going to slowly carve it into a lovely

2178
02:22:58,349 --> 02:23:04,752
standing statuary of Keyleth. May she rest in
peace.

2179
02:23:04,752 --> 02:23:09,514
TRAVIS: Oh, indeed. In the most glorious Edward
Scissorhands movements you ever gestured, there

2180
02:23:09,514 --> 02:23:19,392
before you stands a very dead, but green standing
statuary of Keyleth. Very much no longer a threat

2181
02:23:19,392 --> 02:23:20,613
to you.

2182
02:23:20,613 --> 02:23:22,277
TALIESIN: Quite nice. Quite fitting.

2183
02:23:22,277 --> 02:23:24,150
TRAVIS: Leaning against the wall.

2184
02:23:24,150 --> 02:23:25,449
TALIESIN: Now I'll open my chest.

2185
02:23:25,449 --> 02:23:31,822
TRAVIS: Yes, you go to the chest. It opens and
inside, you find a small vial. Greater healing

2186
02:23:31,822 --> 02:23:33,154
potion.

2187
02:23:33,154 --> 02:23:37,938
LAURA: I'm going to stand at the corner of my room
and aim--

2188
02:23:37,938 --> 02:23:39,195
TRAVIS: Which corner?

2189
02:23:39,195 --> 02:23:40,225
LAURA: My room.

2190
02:23:40,225 --> 02:23:42,334
TRAVIS: Which corner?

2191
02:23:42,404 --> 02:23:45,541
SAM: "My room."

2192
02:23:45,541 --> 02:23:53,896
LAURA: This corner right here and aim up at the
hatch. Is anything happening?

2193
02:23:53,896 --> 02:23:55,465
TRAVIS: When you aim at it?

2194
02:23:55,465 --> 02:23:56,927
LAURA: Yeah.

2195
02:23:56,927 --> 02:24:02,537
TRAVIS: Your shoulders begin to burn ever so
slightly.

2196
02:24:02,537 --> 02:24:04,699
LAURA: Does it look like there's a lock on the
hatch?

2197
02:24:04,699 --> 02:24:05,935
TRAVIS: No.

2198
02:24:05,935 --> 02:24:08,466
LAURA: Does it look like there's a handle on the
hatch?

2199
02:24:08,466 --> 02:24:09,696
TRAVIS: Nope.

2200
02:24:09,696 --> 02:24:12,092
LAURA: Does it look like it opens outward or
inward?

2201
02:24:12,092 --> 02:24:13,531
TRAVIS: You can't tell.

2202
02:24:13,531 --> 02:24:17,722
SAM: I'm going in to investigate my room. One.

2203
02:24:17,722 --> 02:24:28,788
TRAVIS: Cool. You go in, you walk in and you're
facing backwards. You fall down and it seems to be

2204
02:24:28,788 --> 02:24:31,468
a very normal room.

2205
02:24:31,468 --> 02:24:33,421
SAM: I'll open the trunk.

2206
02:24:33,421 --> 02:24:39,527
TRAVIS: Okay. You go forward and as you get to the
trunk, the mimic opens its mouth.

2207
02:24:39,527 --> 02:24:41,907
SAM: (yelling)

2208
02:24:41,907 --> 02:24:45,089
TRAVIS: A pseudopod attacks you.

2209
02:24:45,089 --> 02:24:47,359
SAM: A pseudopod attacks me?

2210
02:24:47,359 --> 02:24:50,113
TRAVIS: You become attached--

2211
02:24:50,113 --> 02:24:51,985
LAURA: To the chest?

2212
02:24:51,985 --> 02:24:53,521
TRAVIS: It has you and it does--

2213
02:24:53,521 --> 02:24:59,513
TALIESIN: Mimics are the worst. Just made of
promises--

2214
02:24:59,513 --> 02:25:01,683
TRAVIS: 16 points of damage.

2215
02:25:01,683 --> 02:25:03,931
LAURA: (laughs) 16?

2216
02:25:03,931 --> 02:25:06,126
SAM: 16 points of damage.

2217
02:25:06,126 --> 02:25:13,855
TRAVIS: It grabs you and it wraps up with its
pseudopod and because you're so small, you're now

2218
02:25:13,855 --> 02:25:17,320
grappled and it covers your mouth so you cannot
scream.

2219
02:25:17,320 --> 02:25:19,712
SAM: Nor cast a spell.

2220
02:25:19,712 --> 02:25:20,929
TRAVIS: Indeed.

2221
02:25:20,929 --> 02:25:28,040
SAM: Unless I have a spell that does not need a
vocal thing. Let me just check.

2222
02:25:28,040 --> 02:25:32,358
TALIESIN: Also grappled, I don't know if you can
actually move your hands either.

2223
02:25:32,358 --> 02:25:34,162
SAM: Let's see here.

2224
02:25:34,162 --> 02:25:37,261
TRAVIS: You are grappled for the moment, Scanlan.

2225
02:25:37,261 --> 02:25:39,401
SAM: Sure. Carry on--

2226
02:25:39,401 --> 02:25:40,682
TRAVIS: Anyone else?

2227
02:25:40,682 --> 02:25:46,954
LIAM: Yeah. I'll do all the same shit. I want to,
before I check for traps at the door, perception

2228
02:25:46,954 --> 02:25:48,371
check for anything--

2229
02:25:48,371 --> 02:25:52,655
TRAVIS: Well, don't be so excited about it. It's a
unique room. You don't know what adventures lie

2230
02:25:52,655 --> 02:25:57,115
inside! So roll an investigation check. See what
happens.

2231
02:25:57,115 --> 02:26:13,233
LIAM: Why'd I roll two? I don't know why I rolled
two. I'll take the lower of them. 23.

2232
02:26:13,233 --> 02:26:16,130
TRAVIS: Your arm falls off. It just falls off
behind you.

2233
02:26:16,130 --> 02:26:18,091
LIAM: I do not understand this game, Grog!

2234
02:26:18,091 --> 02:26:20,067
TRAVIS: No, you come in the room.

2235
02:26:20,067 --> 02:26:22,220
LIAM: Jeepers creepers.

2236
02:26:22,220 --> 02:26:29,585
TRAVIS: You come in. The room does not appear to
be trapped. You do sense movement somewhere in the room.

2237
02:26:29,585 --> 02:26:33,171
LIAM: Do I know what direction I sense the
movement from?

2238
02:26:33,171 --> 02:26:34,407
TRAVIS: It's in front of you.

2239
02:26:34,407 --> 02:26:36,593
LIAM: In front of me? Is it the rug or the chest?

2240
02:26:36,593 --> 02:26:37,900
TRAVIS: You're not sure.

2241
02:26:37,900 --> 02:26:40,962
LIAM: Hmm. What is this thing moving? Sam, wiggle
your hand.

2242
02:26:40,962 --> 02:26:42,486
LAURA: Scanlan.

2243
02:26:42,486 --> 02:26:49,349
LIAM: Where's the movement? It's there. So I go
over to this desk and open it.

2244
02:26:49,349 --> 02:26:53,964
TRAVIS: Right. As you do, the Rug of Smothering--

2245
02:26:53,964 --> 02:26:55,986
LIAM and SAM: Yes!

2246
02:26:55,986 --> 02:27:04,147
TRAVIS: --with its false appearance grapples
you from behind and will attempt to smother you.

2247
02:27:04,147 --> 02:27:05,906
LIAM: What does it have to do?

2248
02:27:05,906 --> 02:27:13,412
SAM: I'm trying to figure out, did Travis find
these things and put them in the room or did he

2249
02:27:13,412 --> 02:27:16,795
think, what can I put in a room?

2250
02:27:16,795 --> 02:27:18,594
TRAVIS: I just went to the Monster Manual.

2251
02:27:18,594 --> 02:27:21,427
SAM: I'll go through the Monster Manual and be
like, ooh, a rug! And put that in there. What else

2252
02:27:21,427 --> 02:27:23,368
can I put in a room... ooh! A plant!

2253
02:27:23,368 --> 02:27:31,267
TRAVIS: It is a 21 to hit and you take-- that does
hit.

2254
02:27:31,267 --> 02:27:33,856
LIAM: I believe so.

2255
02:27:33,856 --> 02:27:39,409
TRAVIS: You take 11 points of bludgeoning damage
and you are restrained, blinded and at risk of

2256
02:27:39,409 --> 02:27:40,539
suffocating.

2257
02:27:40,539 --> 02:27:41,643
LIAM: Sweet.

2258
02:27:41,643 --> 02:27:43,719
LAURA: You're going to die from a rug!

2259
02:27:43,719 --> 02:27:48,366
TRAVIS: You cannot gesture, make a sound or
anything in your tiny little room.

2260
02:27:48,366 --> 02:27:51,135
TALIESIN: You're getting murdered by the touring
company of Aladdin.

2261
02:27:51,135 --> 02:27:53,513
TRAVIS: Percy, what would you like to do?

2262
02:27:53,513 --> 02:27:58,861
TALIESIN: Can I hear any of this? Is there
anything--

2263
02:27:58,861 --> 02:28:05,803
TRAVIS: You are in solid stone rooms. You are at
risk of suffocating.

2264
02:28:05,803 --> 02:28:07,507
LIAM: (muffled) Can I say Jenga? Jenga!

2265
02:28:07,507 --> 02:28:11,309
LAURA: But you can't reach your earring, so nobody
can hear you saying it.

2266
02:28:11,309 --> 02:28:12,742
TRAVIS: Yeah, we didn't-- we have to do that.

2267
02:28:12,742 --> 02:28:14,072
LIAM: We have to do this?

2268
02:28:14,072 --> 02:28:18,169
LAURA: Yeah, we have to touch our earring in order
to-- it's kind of the thing.

2269
02:28:18,169 --> 02:28:20,595
TRAVIS: You've got to tickle your earlobe when you
talk.

2270
02:28:20,595 --> 02:28:24,742
LIAM: I will use a game to experience death. It
will be enlightening.

2271
02:28:24,742 --> 02:28:28,717
TRAVIS: Yeah. I mean, you never know when it might
come for you out here.

2272
02:28:28,717 --> 02:28:34,151
TALIESIN: Is there anything else? Is there
anything in the ceiling? Is there anything on the floor?

2273
02:28:34,151 --> 02:28:37,704
TRAVIS: There is a hatch above you in the ceiling.
A plate metal hatch.

2274
02:28:37,704 --> 02:28:42,418
TALIESIN: I'm going to back up to the same corner
that Vex is in and I'm going to take a couple

2275
02:28:42,418 --> 02:28:44,520
shots at the hatch, see what happens.

2276
02:28:44,520 --> 02:28:49,963
TRAVIS: You back up. Roll to-- no, fuck that. It's
a hatch. You fire. How many shots would you like

2277
02:28:49,963 --> 02:28:51,017
to fire?

2278
02:28:51,017 --> 02:28:53,296
TALIESIN: Three in quick succession.

2279
02:28:53,296 --> 02:28:58,325
TRAVIS: Brilliant. You fire off three quick
shots-- no need to roll-- they all ricochet off of this--

2280
02:28:58,325 --> 02:29:00,175
TALIESIN: Two of them crit!

2281
02:29:00,175 --> 02:29:04,036
TRAVIS: Oh. All right. That makes a difference.

2282
02:29:04,036 --> 02:29:10,242
TALIESIN: It does! I just rolled six times and
four times have been critical.

2283
02:29:10,242 --> 02:29:15,214
TRAVIS: You fire your first shot and while it
ricochets off, it starts bouncing around the stone

2284
02:29:15,214 --> 02:29:23,216
room dangerously close to yourself. You are so
calm and cool, and with that debonair Percy charm,

2285
02:29:23,216 --> 02:29:28,954
you merely make a slight adjustment with your gun,
and you fire. The door-- it hits and you see it

2286
02:29:28,954 --> 02:29:36,004
start to crack and start to loosen from the wall.
A small piece of the hatch is now showing some

2287
02:29:36,004 --> 02:29:39,965
visible line of sight between it and the ceiling.

2288
02:29:39,965 --> 02:29:45,261
TALIESIN: I think I'm starting to open this hatch
which is in my room. Can everybody hear me?

2289
02:29:45,261 --> 02:29:49,026
LAURA: Can we hear him? Can I hear him?

2290
02:29:49,026 --> 02:29:50,324
TRAVIS: You can hear him.

2291
02:29:50,324 --> 02:29:51,492
LAURA: I can hear you, darling.

2292
02:29:51,492 --> 02:29:52,956
SAM: But I can't talk.

2293
02:29:52,956 --> 02:29:55,065
LAURA: I can hear you, darling. What's up?

2294
02:29:55,065 --> 02:29:57,940
TALIESIN: Oh, I've got a hatch in my room and I've
got it a bit open at this point.

2295
02:29:57,940 --> 02:29:59,535
LAURA: I've got a hatch too!

2296
02:29:59,535 --> 02:30:01,494
TALIESIN: I wonder if there's five hatches?

2297
02:30:01,494 --> 02:30:05,446
LAURA: Scanlan, Vax, look up. Do you see a hatch?

2298
02:30:09,113 --> 02:30:10,576
TALIESIN: Be rude. That's fine.

2299
02:30:10,576 --> 02:30:12,271
LAURA: Dicks.

2300
02:30:12,271 --> 02:30:13,817
TALIESIN: So rude.

2301
02:30:13,817 --> 02:30:18,839
SAM: We're not going to mega-game.

2302
02:30:18,839 --> 02:30:23,123
LAURA: Should I come in your room and look at your
hatch, or should I continue to look at my hatch?

2303
02:30:23,194 --> 02:30:25,095
LIAM: Mega Man is for cowards.

2304
02:30:25,095 --> 02:30:28,267
TALIESIN: My hatch is a bit-- Have you
loosened your hatch yet?

2305
02:30:28,267 --> 02:30:31,525
LAURA: Let me give it a try.

2306
02:30:31,525 --> 02:30:40,447
TRAVIS: While you're talking, the mimic in
Scanlan's room will again try to smother you with

2307
02:30:40,447 --> 02:30:42,339
a bite attack while it's grappling you.

2308
02:30:42,339 --> 02:30:43,842
SAM: Sure.

2309
02:30:43,842 --> 02:30:51,755
TRAVIS: Hold on, I've got to add. Five seconds.
Where's the music?!

2310
02:30:51,755 --> 02:30:54,459
SAM: Servants, come on, now!

2311
02:30:54,459 --> 02:30:56,122
LAURA: They got so tired.

2312
02:30:56,122 --> 02:30:57,462
TALIESIN: Union break.

2313
02:30:57,462 --> 02:30:59,575
LIAM: Grog, you're breaking the verisimilitude.

2314
02:30:59,575 --> 02:31:01,296
LAURA: There it is. The back.

2315
02:31:01,296 --> 02:31:05,672
TRAVIS: With advantage, that is 24 points of
damage.

2316
02:31:05,672 --> 02:31:10,124
TALIESIN: How are you doing right now, Scanlan?
Not that I know. I shouldn't know.

2317
02:31:10,124 --> 02:31:11,835
TRAVIS: Where are you at?

2318
02:31:11,835 --> 02:31:13,549
TALIESIN: Is that a yummy sound?

2319
02:31:13,549 --> 02:31:20,277
TRAVIS: Vax, your rug of smothering also begins to
crush you again.

2320
02:31:20,277 --> 02:31:23,843
LIAM: This is not my first time.

2321
02:31:23,843 --> 02:31:25,779
LAURA: Being smothered by a rug?

2322
02:31:25,779 --> 02:31:28,163
LIAM: Having my breathing snuffed out.

2323
02:31:28,163 --> 02:31:34,950
TRAVIS: Actually, before this happens, roll a
strength check.

2324
02:31:34,950 --> 02:31:40,123
LIAM: A strength check? All right. I roll the
round die. I'll roll the Grog one. That's a one.

2325
02:31:40,123 --> 02:31:41,904
I'm going to use another luck.

2326
02:31:41,904 --> 02:31:43,327
LAURA: That's your last one.

2327
02:31:43,327 --> 02:31:47,711
LIAM: It's not. It's my third one, a-hole. I have four.

2328
02:31:47,711 --> 02:31:53,859
TRAVIS: You don't need to roll your modifier.
That's enough. You break free, and the rug starts

2329
02:31:53,859 --> 02:31:58,123
to shimmy down across your legs. It's not
smothering you anymore, but it's still keeping you

2330
02:31:58,123 --> 02:32:01,513
in place. Your arms are free, and you can
breathe.

2331
02:32:01,513 --> 02:32:06,116
LIAM: The most important thing to me right now is
to point out that my strength is 14, which is

2332
02:32:06,116 --> 02:32:11,632
slightly above average, which is very different
than your shit-ass seven, with a modifier of

2333
02:32:11,632 --> 02:32:13,163
negative two.

2334
02:32:13,163 --> 02:32:18,873
TRAVIS: While it is around your legs, it will bite
you for 21 points of damage. Not bite you, crush

2335
02:32:18,873 --> 02:32:20,193
you. Sorry.

2336
02:32:20,193 --> 02:32:25,292
LIAM: Does it roll to hit, or do I make a dex
save?

2337
02:32:25,292 --> 02:32:29,679
TRAVIS: It's still grappling you, so you're in the
same place, still, but you can breathe and you can

2338
02:32:29,679 --> 02:32:31,354
move, but it's still around your legs.

2339
02:32:31,354 --> 02:32:33,702
LIAM: What did I just roll to do, though, Grog? I
don't understand.

2340
02:32:33,702 --> 02:32:36,190
TRAVIS: So you could breathe and not suffocate.

2341
02:32:36,190 --> 02:32:41,522
LIAM: That's very important. Is it important for
me, though? I haven't breathed very much at all--

2342
02:32:41,522 --> 02:32:44,281
TRAVIS: You, technically? No. Not important for
you.

2343
02:32:44,281 --> 02:32:46,011
LIAM: I would have been fine in there.

2344
02:32:46,011 --> 02:32:49,086
TRAVIS: But your singing career would have been
limited.

2345
02:32:49,086 --> 02:32:51,367
LIAM: Okay, so I take a bunch of damage, right?

2346
02:32:51,367 --> 02:32:52,619
TRAVIS: 21 points of damage.

2347
02:32:52,619 --> 02:32:53,989
LIAM: 21 points of damage, okay.

2348
02:32:53,989 --> 02:32:56,578
TRAVIS: And you are now free.

2349
02:32:56,578 --> 02:32:58,988
LIAM: Hey, I have 69 hit points. Nice.

2350
02:32:58,988 --> 02:33:03,150
LAURA: Can I fly up and look at the hatch up
close?

2351
02:33:03,150 --> 02:33:05,739
TRAVIS: Sure. You take out the broom, you fly up
to the hatch--

2352
02:33:05,739 --> 02:33:07,450
LAURA: Also, can Trinket come in the room?

2353
02:33:07,450 --> 02:33:08,955
TRAVIS: Sure. Trinket comes in.

2354
02:33:08,955 --> 02:33:10,549
LAURA: He's going to stand in the other corner.

2355
02:33:10,549 --> 02:33:12,287
LIAM: Are the hatches bars?

2356
02:33:12,287 --> 02:33:16,774
TRAVIS: Plate metal. A square piece of plate
metal.

2357
02:33:16,774 --> 02:33:20,098
LAURA: What can I see up close? Anything?

2358
02:33:20,098 --> 02:33:25,314
TRAVIS: It is a plate metal hatch. A sheet of
metal with rivets, and it's solid.

2359
02:33:25,314 --> 02:33:26,902
LAURA: Can I push on it?

2360
02:33:26,902 --> 02:33:28,112
TRAVIS: You cannot.

2361
02:33:28,112 --> 02:33:29,959
LAURA: Can I get my fingers in and pull on it?

2362
02:33:29,959 --> 02:33:31,969
TRAVIS: No.

2363
02:33:31,969 --> 02:33:35,150
LAURA: Can I stick a dagger in at the edges and
try to pry it open?

2364
02:33:35,150 --> 02:33:40,715
TRAVIS: No. You could try, and I could make you
roll a bunch of times. It wouldn't work.

2365
02:33:40,715 --> 02:33:45,850
LAURA: Well, he rolled two criticals, and
something happened. What if I roll a critical?

2366
02:33:45,850 --> 02:33:47,969
TRAVIS: Roll a dice.

2367
02:33:47,969 --> 02:33:51,194
LAURA: Ooh, so close. It was a 19.

2368
02:33:51,194 --> 02:33:55,014
TRAVIS: You pull on it, and you hear (metal
creaking).

2369
02:33:55,014 --> 02:33:57,093
LIAM: There's a witch behind it.

2370
02:33:57,093 --> 02:33:59,734
TALIESIN: I've got mine kind of open, if you want
to come here.

2371
02:33:59,734 --> 02:34:02,651
TRAVIS: Scanlan, roll a strength saving throw.

2372
02:34:02,651 --> 02:34:05,525
SAM: 13.

2373
02:34:05,525 --> 02:34:10,875
TRAVIS: 13? That's actually exactly what you
needed. You manage to get your arms free, and you

2374
02:34:10,875 --> 02:34:16,419
break free of the mimic, but it is still coming at
you. Now you see teeth coming out of this chest, a

2375
02:34:16,419 --> 02:34:18,461
giant pseudopod tongue.

2376
02:34:18,461 --> 02:34:23,200
SAM: Should I escape, or should I kill it? I don't
know.

2377
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:25,295
LAURA: Kill it!

2378
02:34:25,295 --> 02:34:30,147
SAM: I will step back, and I will Lightning Bolt
it at level five!

2379
02:34:30,147 --> 02:34:33,493
TRAVIS: Go for it.

2380
02:34:33,493 --> 02:34:35,300
TALIESIN: What does any of that mean?

2381
02:34:35,300 --> 02:34:39,737
SAM: I will Lightning Bolt it at level five!

2382
02:34:39,737 --> 02:34:45,797
TALIESIN: It was like you started to say four and
said five. It turned into an accent.

2383
02:34:45,797 --> 02:34:48,048
LIAM: I thought you said you played GURPS in grade
school.

2384
02:34:48,048 --> 02:34:53,334
SAM: He has to make a dex save. I think it's a dex
save.

2385
02:34:53,334 --> 02:34:54,947
TRAVIS: Of what?

2386
02:34:54,947 --> 02:35:01,330
SAM: Oh boy. It's probably either 15, or it's my
spell DC. If it's my spell DC, I wouldn't have the

2387
02:35:01,330 --> 02:35:03,416
cone up, so it would be 20.

2388
02:35:03,416 --> 02:35:05,189
TRAVIS: That is a 13.

2389
02:35:05,189 --> 02:35:10,346
SAM: Well, either way, he fails, so he gets 10d6
of damage.

2390
02:35:10,346 --> 02:35:13,916
LAURA: That's a lot of lightning damage.

2391
02:35:13,916 --> 02:35:16,754
LIAM: Sounds like a lot of something, of
something.

2392
02:35:16,754 --> 02:35:20,012
SAM: How many is that? That's nine.

2393
02:35:20,012 --> 02:35:25,531
LIAM: These scarves were a wonderful purchase for
the group. They are so cozy.

2394
02:35:25,531 --> 02:35:27,504
LAURA: So warm.

2395
02:35:27,504 --> 02:35:29,726
LIAM: We need them in Vasselheim.

2396
02:35:29,726 --> 02:35:36,302
SAM: 39. Oh! And one more. 43.

2397
02:35:36,302 --> 02:35:45,124
TRAVIS: With that one lightning, you see the mimic
shake, tense up, quake, and burst apart into

2398
02:35:45,124 --> 02:35:51,081
purple goo. It splatters little green noodles all
over the floor where it was, and you see in its

2399
02:35:51,081 --> 02:35:54,466
muck a little vial where it was.

2400
02:35:54,466 --> 02:35:56,914
SAM: I inspect the vial.

2401
02:35:56,914 --> 02:35:58,472
TRAVIS: It's a greater healing potion.

2402
02:35:58,472 --> 02:35:59,757
SAM: I chug it.

2403
02:35:59,757 --> 02:36:01,015
TRAVIS: Yeah, you chug it. Go for it.

2404
02:36:01,015 --> 02:36:02,674
SAM: What is that, four something?

2405
02:36:02,674 --> 02:36:04,328
LAURA: 4d4.

2406
02:36:04,328 --> 02:36:11,819
SAM: Everyone, all the rooms have horrible
creatures in them! Be careful!

2407
02:36:11,819 --> 02:36:14,221
LAURA: Mine didn't have any creatures in it.

2408
02:36:14,221 --> 02:36:16,590
TALIESIN: Mine had a mildly irritated house
plant.

2409
02:36:16,590 --> 02:36:18,468
LIAM: Fuck the lot of you!

2410
02:36:18,468 --> 02:36:27,514
TRAVIS: That's it? Not "help?" While he's healing,
Vax, what would you like to do?

2411
02:36:27,514 --> 02:36:34,663
LIAM: My hands are free? I throw Whisper 15 feet
out the door and bamf to where it strikes on the ground.

2412
02:36:34,663 --> 02:36:37,711
TRAVIS: Nice. You pop outside the door.

2413
02:36:37,711 --> 02:36:42,500
LIAM: Yeah, and then I will turn now-- it's up to
you, Grog--

2414
02:36:42,500 --> 02:36:47,990
TRAVIS: Unleash Armageddon. Do what you do.

2415
02:36:47,990 --> 02:36:50,273
LIAM: I'm going to use two daggers, if I can.

2416
02:36:50,273 --> 02:36:52,977
TRAVIS: Now's the time, mate.

2417
02:36:52,977 --> 02:36:58,904
LIAM: Wait. I'm going to use my Vow of Enmity on
the rug, and then I'm going to attack.

2418
02:36:58,904 --> 02:37:01,115
TALIESIN: Are you going to cut a rug, then?

2419
02:37:01,115 --> 02:37:05,691
TRAVIS: You get 150 XP.

2420
02:37:05,691 --> 02:37:08,889
TALIESIN: 150 XP for the terrible pun. Huzzah!

2421
02:37:08,889 --> 02:37:10,478
SAM: How many do you have?

2422
02:37:10,478 --> 02:37:12,043
LIAM: I have zero points!

2423
02:37:12,043 --> 02:37:13,686
TRAVIS: I am susceptible to puns.

2424
02:37:13,686 --> 02:37:14,828
TALIESIN: Good to know.

2425
02:37:14,828 --> 02:37:16,395
SAM: That is good to know, actually.

2426
02:37:16,395 --> 02:37:25,217
LIAM: (giggles) 31, and because my Vow of Enmity
on this rug is in fucking effect, I get sneak

2427
02:37:25,217 --> 02:37:32,814
attack damage, so that is two, plus eight is ten,
and then we add some of that. 12, and these guys

2428
02:37:32,814 --> 02:37:34,942
go, as well. (counting)

2429
02:37:34,942 --> 02:37:37,709
LAURA: I like that you can sneak attack the rug.
It doesn't know you're there!

2430
02:37:37,709 --> 02:37:40,402
TRAVIS: Right. It's a rug.

2431
02:37:40,402 --> 02:37:43,723
LIAM: 39 points of damage on the fucking Persian
carpet.

2432
02:37:43,723 --> 02:37:53,276
TRAVIS: And with that, the rug quakes and falls
flat, deflated. A regular rug now. Slightly

2433
02:37:53,276 --> 02:37:55,172
unraveled at the corners.

2434
02:37:55,172 --> 02:38:00,462
LIAM: Hardwood floors are much fucking better.
Fuck you. And I'm going to walk in and check out

2435
02:38:00,462 --> 02:38:01,712
that chest.

2436
02:38:01,712 --> 02:38:05,725
TRAVIS: Indeed. You hear, all of a sudden, as you
check out the chest-- indeed, there is a greater

2437
02:38:05,725 --> 02:38:14,138
healing potion. As Vax terminates the rug, you
hear a click in all of the latches above your heads.

2438
02:38:14,138 --> 02:38:20,569
LAURA: Oh no. Am I still up at the latch? Am I
still right at the latch?

2439
02:38:20,569 --> 02:38:21,755
TRAVIS: Are you?

2440
02:38:21,755 --> 02:38:23,859
LAURA: Well, I said I was. I never stopped being
there.

2441
02:38:23,859 --> 02:38:27,693
TRAVIS: Yeah. There you are, just flying right
next to it.

2442
02:38:27,693 --> 02:38:29,471
TALIESIN: I'll take another shot at mine.

2443
02:38:29,471 --> 02:38:35,074
TRAVIS: You fire, and the latch flips open at the
top.

2444
02:38:35,074 --> 02:38:37,660
TALIESIN: Hello?

2445
02:38:37,660 --> 02:38:40,834
LAURA: Can I push on mine?

2446
02:38:40,834 --> 02:38:42,879
TALIESIN: Hello?

2447
02:38:42,879 --> 02:38:50,655
TRAVIS: No response. You may push on yours. It
lifts. It comes right back down, but lifts.

2448
02:38:50,655 --> 02:38:52,810
LAURA: My latch is open. My hatch!

2449
02:38:52,810 --> 02:38:54,229
TALIESIN: Mine, as well.

2450
02:38:54,229 --> 02:38:56,201
LAURA: Scanlan, Vax?

2451
02:38:56,201 --> 02:38:58,057
SAM: Seems like mine's open, too.

2452
02:38:58,057 --> 02:38:59,530
LAURA: Should we go in?

2453
02:38:59,530 --> 02:39:02,353
TALIESIN: I'm going to activate my spider boots
and head on up there.

2454
02:39:02,353 --> 02:39:07,876
TRAVIS: Excellent. You walk up the side of the
wall, doing the little shimmy that Percy does so

2455
02:39:07,876 --> 02:39:13,457
well in his bedroom when he's getting dressed in
Whitestone. He pops through the hatch. Do you go

2456
02:39:13,457 --> 02:39:14,685
up, as well?

2457
02:39:14,685 --> 02:39:16,507
LAURA: I do. I bamf Trinket into my necklace,
first.

2458
02:39:16,507 --> 02:39:19,579
TRAVIS: Trinket goes in the necklace. You go up
through the hatch. What about you two fellows?

2459
02:39:19,579 --> 02:39:24,047
SAM: I'm going to turn into a dung beetle and fly
straight up.

2460
02:39:24,047 --> 02:39:28,527
TRAVIS: Right, yeah. Into this tiny little dung
beetle, you fly. You hit the hatch.

2461
02:39:28,527 --> 02:39:30,137
SAM: It's solid?!

2462
02:39:30,137 --> 02:39:33,812
TRAVIS: There was a click. It didn't fucking
open.

2463
02:39:33,812 --> 02:39:35,863
SAM: I thought it had bars.

2464
02:39:35,863 --> 02:39:38,796
TRAVIS: (popping)

2465
02:39:38,796 --> 02:39:40,978
SAM: I thought it had bars!

2466
02:39:40,978 --> 02:39:45,474
TRAVIS: You take five points of stupid damage.

2467
02:39:45,474 --> 02:39:50,381
SAM: Then I'm back out as a gnome, and I guess I'm
falling.

2468
02:39:50,381 --> 02:39:54,303
TRAVIS: Yeah, you fall a whole ten, 11 feet.

2469
02:39:54,303 --> 02:39:55,909
SAM: More damage?

2470
02:39:55,909 --> 02:39:58,302
TRAVIS: You take two points of gnome damage.

2471
02:39:58,302 --> 02:40:02,091
SAM: All right. Shit.

2472
02:40:02,091 --> 02:40:08,572
TRAVIS: Vax, what are you doing? Wings? Yeah, the
fucking wings come out, even though you're on the

2473
02:40:08,572 --> 02:40:12,685
ground, and you walk, very badass, back through
the room.

2474
02:40:12,685 --> 02:40:22,694
LIAM: I'll grab the potion. I will use them to
easily hop the 12 feet up, and then I will pull

2475
02:40:22,694 --> 02:40:30,851
the wings in. Press the wings into the back of me,
and slide and crawl my way up this tunnel.

2476
02:40:30,851 --> 02:40:33,151
TRAVIS: Brilliant. You pop up through the hatch.

2477
02:40:33,151 --> 02:40:34,885
LAURA: Is it another room, or is it a tunnel?

2478
02:40:34,885 --> 02:40:36,084
TRAVIS: We'll shortly see.

2479
02:40:36,084 --> 02:40:37,756
LIAM: My wings are silky smooth.

2480
02:40:37,756 --> 02:40:43,175
TRAVIS: Scanlan, what are you doing? You come to,
and you're like, "Fuck. Why did I turn into a dung

2481
02:40:43,175 --> 02:40:45,132
"beetle? The latch was still closed."

2482
02:40:45,132 --> 02:40:48,668
SAM: All right. Now I will turn into a monkey.

2483
02:40:48,668 --> 02:40:50,548
TRAVIS: A monkey. What kind of monkey?

2484
02:40:50,548 --> 02:40:51,986
SAM: A gibbon.

2485
02:40:51,986 --> 02:40:53,700
TRAVIS: A small gibbon. Okay.

2486
02:40:53,700 --> 02:40:55,755
SAM: Big enough that it has muscles.

2487
02:40:55,755 --> 02:40:57,068
TRAVIS: We'll find out.

2488
02:40:57,068 --> 02:40:59,767
SAM: I crawl up to the top and try to push open
the latch.

2489
02:40:59,767 --> 02:41:06,761
TRAVIS: You get up there, and as you start to
push, roll a strength check with disadvantage.

2490
02:41:06,761 --> 02:41:09,720
SAM: Natural 20.

2491
02:41:09,720 --> 02:41:11,612
SAM and TALIESIN: Natural 20!

2492
02:41:11,612 --> 02:41:14,415
ALL: Whoa!

2493
02:41:14,415 --> 02:41:20,889
TRAVIS: This very large metal latch flies open.

2494
02:41:20,889 --> 02:41:25,905
SAM: I shit on the latch and keep going.

2495
02:41:25,905 --> 02:41:32,332
TRAVIS: You pop up through the latch. As Scanlan
makes his gibbon way through the latch, all of you

2496
02:41:32,332 --> 02:41:42,851
find yourself in a new space, and all of the
latches slam closed. You find yourself in a new space.

2497
02:41:42,851 --> 02:41:45,851
LAURA: Grog, you are so artistic!

2498
02:41:45,851 --> 02:41:52,963
TRAVIS: Aren't I? It resembles the shape of the
previous map.

2499
02:41:52,963 --> 02:41:55,805
TALIESIN: That resembles the shape of the previous
map.

2500
02:41:55,805 --> 02:41:58,326
SAM: That's a circle, just like the last one.

2501
02:41:58,326 --> 02:42:11,296
TRAVIS: You find yourselves with a flat floor. You
have a visual line of sight with all of the

2502
02:42:11,296 --> 02:42:12,773
members of your team.

2503
02:42:12,773 --> 02:42:14,025
LAURA: We can see each other?

2504
02:42:14,025 --> 02:42:15,219
TRAVIS: You can see each other.

2505
02:42:15,219 --> 02:42:17,862
SAM: Except for one. Who would have been the
star?

2506
02:42:17,862 --> 02:42:28,025
TRAVIS: There's some sort of body laying above the
area of the room with the door that was already

2507
02:42:28,025 --> 02:42:29,119
open.

2508
02:42:29,119 --> 02:42:30,871
TALIESIN: I'm going to examine it.

2509
02:42:30,871 --> 02:42:33,253
SAM: Wait, are there walls separating us?

2510
02:42:33,253 --> 02:42:41,048
TRAVIS: You are on what seems to be the roof of
the room previous, and there's a giant tower right

2511
02:42:41,048 --> 02:42:50,519
in the middle of all of this. At the top of this
tower, not to size, there's a large platform dome

2512
02:42:50,519 --> 02:42:54,152
area up here with light radiating out of it.

2513
02:42:54,152 --> 02:42:59,982
LIAM: Guys, from my point of view, I can see
Fletcher's Mill emblazoned at the base of the

2514
02:42:59,982 --> 02:43:02,070
tower. I just imagined it!

2515
02:43:02,070 --> 02:43:06,752
LAURA: Is that Sharpie at the bottom of that
pepper mill?

2516
02:43:06,752 --> 02:43:08,411
TRAVIS: No. Nope.

2517
02:43:08,411 --> 02:43:12,474
SAM: Did he ruin your designer pepper mill?

2518
02:43:12,474 --> 02:43:16,541
LAURA: Travis Willingham!

2519
02:43:16,541 --> 02:43:18,579
TRAVIS: It was a wedding gift. Who cares?

2520
02:43:18,579 --> 02:43:21,880
(laughter)

2521
02:43:21,880 --> 02:43:31,104
TRAVIS: So you see your comrades up atop the roof
of this platform and some sort of corpse or

2522
02:43:31,104 --> 02:43:33,076
motionless body.

2523
02:43:33,076 --> 02:43:34,769
LAURA: Can we walk over to it?

2524
02:43:34,769 --> 02:43:35,880
TRAVIS: You can try.

2525
02:43:35,880 --> 02:43:37,692
LAURA: I want to walk over to it and kick it.

2526
02:43:37,692 --> 02:43:44,524
TRAVIS: You start to walk over, and as you reach
this border, you are struck by an invisible field,

2527
02:43:44,524 --> 02:43:48,300
and you take eight points of force damage.

2528
02:43:48,300 --> 02:43:49,625
LAURA: Oh no, eight points.

2529
02:43:49,625 --> 02:43:52,913
LIAM: I wanted to pickpocket Scanlan so I could
start Robbing Gibbons.

2530
02:43:52,913 --> 02:43:58,358
TRAVIS: As you hit the wall, there is a shimmer of
energy that quickly dissipates in between your

2531
02:43:58,358 --> 02:44:00,337
section and someone else's.

2532
02:44:00,337 --> 02:44:05,631
LAURA: Is it gone now, or is it still there?

2533
02:44:05,631 --> 02:44:08,136
TRAVIS: It shimmers and disappears.

2534
02:44:08,136 --> 02:44:10,380
LAURA and TALIESIN: It's probably still there.

2535
02:44:10,380 --> 02:44:13,412
TALIESIN: I want to try stepping up the column.

2536
02:44:13,412 --> 02:44:22,032
TRAVIS: As you move towards the column, you see on
this tower, it is made of stone, but there seem

2537
02:44:22,032 --> 02:44:24,964
to be built-in footholds and handholds.

2538
02:44:24,964 --> 02:44:31,891
TALIESIN: I ignore them. I'm not going to put my
hands or feet in any of those holes.

2539
02:44:31,891 --> 02:44:36,531
TRAVIS: It appears the same energy covers that
tower, and you take eight points of force damage.

2540
02:44:36,531 --> 02:44:49,220
As Percy touches and activates the shield for a
second time, the lights around you dim, and you

2541
02:44:49,220 --> 02:44:53,363
feel heat around each of you individually.

2542
02:44:53,363 --> 02:45:04,280
You are struck with horror as form begins
to take shape in front of each of you. Behind

2543
02:45:04,280 --> 02:45:17,273
Percy, all of a sudden, the form of a mind flayer
begins to take shape. Behind Vax, a red-skinned,

2544
02:45:17,273 --> 02:45:27,528
armor-clad, winged demon appears. A cambion, right
in front of our rogue.

2545
02:45:27,528 --> 02:45:30,840
SAM: You looked these up last night, you had to
look these up.

2546
02:45:30,840 --> 02:45:36,627
TRAVIS: In front of Vex, a pony.

2547
02:45:36,627 --> 02:45:39,196
LAURA: Oh, a pony, yay!

2548
02:45:39,196 --> 02:45:41,486
TALIESIN: Don't touch it, it's evil.

2549
02:45:41,486 --> 02:45:45,179
TRAVIS: And in front of Scanlan materializes, to
his horror,

2550
02:45:45,179 --> 02:45:46,727
a fucking T-rex.

2551
02:45:46,727 --> 02:46:01,536
(laughter)

2552
02:46:01,536 --> 02:46:08,089
TRAVIS: A giant roar echoes across the land.

2553
02:46:08,089 --> 02:46:09,938
LIAM: Over a gibbon!

2554
02:46:09,938 --> 02:46:15,480
TALIESIN: I have been waiting for gibbon versus
T-rex my entire life!

2555
02:46:15,480 --> 02:46:25,663
TRAVIS: A T-rex versus a gibbon. You all stare in
horror at perfectly picked enemies for you. I need

2556
02:46:25,663 --> 02:46:29,456
you all to roll initiative.

2557
02:46:29,456 --> 02:46:39,632
SAM: I rolled one. 20, 20, one, my last three
rolls.

2558
02:46:39,632 --> 02:46:40,925
TALIESIN: 23.

2559
02:46:40,925 --> 02:46:45,132
TRAVIS: 23, that's the Percy I know. Vex?

2560
02:46:45,132 --> 02:46:46,536
LAURA: 22.

2561
02:46:46,536 --> 02:46:47,799
TRAVIS: Vax?

2562
02:46:47,799 --> 02:46:48,895
LIAM: A big 12.

2563
02:46:48,895 --> 02:46:56,292
TALIESIN: That potion was 4d4?

2564
02:46:56,292 --> 02:47:00,811
SAM: I did 4d4 plus four, is that right for a
greater healing potion?

2565
02:47:00,811 --> 02:47:02,029
LIAM: It is.

2566
02:47:02,029 --> 02:47:20,516
TRAVIS: Okay. The cambion turns and faces Vax at
the top of the initiative, and he will unleash his

2567
02:47:20,516 --> 02:47:26,797
Fire Ray at you. 26 to hit.

2568
02:47:26,797 --> 02:47:28,735
LIAM: Yeah, that'll hit.

2569
02:47:28,735 --> 02:47:35,940
TRAVIS: This is hard. You take 12 points of fire
damage.

2570
02:47:35,940 --> 02:47:40,726
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to pretend like the
Deathwalker's Ward is set to fire.

2571
02:47:40,726 --> 02:47:42,237
TRAVIS: Sure.

2572
02:47:42,237 --> 02:47:44,342
LIAM: So halve that.

2573
02:47:44,342 --> 02:47:52,961
TRAVIS: So six, nice. And he will make a ranged
spear attack against you. It's only 19.

2574
02:47:52,961 --> 02:47:55,273
LIAM: Does not hit. Sidestep.

2575
02:47:55,273 --> 02:48:02,523
TRAVIS: The deer shoots-- The deer? The deer
bounds past-- The spear misses you, as you are

2576
02:48:02,523 --> 02:48:08,598
presented with this new foe, and with a bonus
action he will take flight. But I'm not breaking

2577
02:48:08,598 --> 02:48:16,987
out those fucking stands, so let's just say he takes
flight. Next in the initiative order, this pony

2578
02:48:16,987 --> 02:48:21,942
takes a few steps towards you and (snorting).

2579
02:48:21,942 --> 02:48:25,527
LAURA: No, don't attack me, pony!

2580
02:48:25,527 --> 02:48:27,784
TRAVIS: And turns into a mystical unicorn.

2581
02:48:27,784 --> 02:48:34,891
(laughter)

2582
02:48:34,891 --> 02:48:37,880
TRAVIS: A large, celestial, lawfully good enemy!

2583
02:48:37,880 --> 02:48:40,736
TALIESIN: You're going to have to kill it.

2584
02:48:40,736 --> 02:48:43,242
LAURA: No, I'm not going to, it's so cute!

2585
02:48:43,242 --> 02:48:46,500
TALIESIN: We have to murder and eat our opponents,
it's the only way out.

2586
02:48:46,500 --> 02:48:50,501
TRAVIS: And it will cast Entangle on you.

2587
02:48:50,501 --> 02:48:54,167
LAURA: What do I have to roll to avoid it?

2588
02:48:54,167 --> 02:49:01,919
TRAVIS: You have to make a DC 18. It is a dex.

2589
02:49:01,919 --> 02:49:11,776
LAURA: Okay. 17.

2590
02:49:11,776 --> 02:49:17,405
TRAVIS: You feel all of a sudden these vines come
out of the stonework and it holds you where you

2591
02:49:17,405 --> 02:49:28,318
are. And it will charge straight at you using its
magical horn. 22.

2592
02:49:28,318 --> 02:49:39,001
LAURA: It hits. But I have uncanny dodge and
evade, which one do I use?

2593
02:49:39,001 --> 02:49:42,839
LIAM: Evasion for a dex save, uncanny dodge can
halve one melee attack per round.

2594
02:49:42,839 --> 02:49:49,726
TRAVIS: It does 12 points of piercing damage and I
need to you roll a strength saving throw or be

2595
02:49:49,726 --> 02:49:52,640
knocked prone by its mystical power.

2596
02:49:52,640 --> 02:49:56,580
LAURA: A strength saving throw? If I use evasion
does it still have to do that?

2597
02:49:56,580 --> 02:49:58,539
TRAVIS: I have no idea.

2598
02:49:58,539 --> 02:50:01,507
LIAM: Evasion only triggers if you have to make a
dex save.

2599
02:50:01,507 --> 02:50:06,779
LAURA: That was so fucking close. 25.

2600
02:50:06,779 --> 02:50:12,253
TRAVIS: You're not knocked prone, you sidestep it,
but you only take the damage. Percy, you are up.

2601
02:50:12,253 --> 02:50:19,310
TALIESIN: I am going to throw Manners at this
creature.

2602
02:50:19,310 --> 02:50:20,671
TRAVIS: Brilliant.

2603
02:50:20,671 --> 02:50:22,704
LIAM: Is it a JRPG, you're throwing mana?

2604
02:50:22,704 --> 02:50:41,652
TALIESIN: Manners, not mana. Let's see, that's a
ranged attack roll, that's 30 to hit.

2605
02:50:41,652 --> 02:50:43,447
TRAVIS: That will hit.

2606
02:50:43,447 --> 02:50:57,132
TALIESIN: My target is restrained. On its turn, it
can make a DC 20 strength check to try and get

2607
02:50:57,132 --> 02:50:59,219
out. At the moment, it's restrained.

2608
02:50:59,219 --> 02:51:03,157
TRAVIS: A natural one, he is restrained.

2609
02:51:03,157 --> 02:51:08,878
TALIESIN: And while he's restrained, I'm going to
walk over and I'm going to burn an action surge.

2610
02:51:08,878 --> 02:51:13,058
I'm going to stab him with my sword three times.
And since he's restrained I think I get a bonus on

2611
02:51:13,058 --> 02:51:14,469
that, don't I?

2612
02:51:14,469 --> 02:51:18,149
TRAVIS: You're so nasty. Melee attacks.

2613
02:51:18,149 --> 02:51:26,502
TALIESIN: Let's not waste bullets on anything like
this. I'll take three swipes. Is it an auto-crit

2614
02:51:26,502 --> 02:51:28,158
if they're restrained?

2615
02:51:28,158 --> 02:51:31,893
TRAVIS: Yeah. No, you have advantage, I think.

2616
02:51:31,893 --> 02:51:37,455
TALIESIN: I have advantage, okay. So I'll go with
that. I don't actually remember.

2617
02:51:37,455 --> 02:51:40,942
TRAVIS: If I overheard the guy at the tavern
right.

2618
02:51:40,942 --> 02:51:50,063
TALIESIN: That's one normal hit. 25 to hit.

2619
02:51:50,063 --> 02:51:53,939
TRAVIS: Yeah. He has a very low AC.

2620
02:51:53,939 --> 02:51:56,647
TALIESIN: And the last one is 24 to hit.

2621
02:51:56,647 --> 02:51:57,983
TRAVIS: All three hit.

2622
02:51:57,983 --> 02:52:20,215
TALIESIN: So that's 36 points of piercing damage.
And I'm going to breathe deep. I may use my bonus

2623
02:52:20,215 --> 02:52:21,964
action to take a healing potion.

2624
02:52:21,964 --> 02:52:25,346
TRAVIS: Please do. All right, next up: Vex.

2625
02:52:25,346 --> 02:52:32,379
LAURA: That's me! Are my hands restrained or is it
just my feet?

2626
02:52:32,379 --> 02:52:39,364
TRAVIS: Just your feet, you cannot move. Let me
check, because I'm sure I'm getting this totally right.

2627
02:52:39,364 --> 02:52:41,480
LIAM: What are you checking, Grog? Do you have a
book or something for this?

2628
02:52:41,480 --> 02:52:49,068
TRAVIS: No, I carve notes into the thingy. Yeah,
you just can't move.

2629
02:52:49,068 --> 02:52:59,085
LAURA: I can't move my feet? Okay. I'm going to
cast Grasping Vine. And I'm going to try to hook

2630
02:52:59,085 --> 02:53:05,499
a vine around the unicorn and pull him back
towards the corner right here.

2631
02:53:05,499 --> 02:53:08,211
LIAM: Oh, you killed him!

2632
02:53:08,211 --> 02:53:09,615
LAURA: He dies.

2633
02:53:09,615 --> 02:53:17,960
TRAVIS: He is top heavy. Let's go with option
number two. None of these guys want to stay up!

2634
02:53:17,960 --> 02:53:19,995
You're so drunk.

2635
02:53:19,995 --> 02:53:22,522
SAM: Go home, unicorn.

2636
02:53:22,522 --> 02:53:29,700
TRAVIS: Unicorn will use one of his legendary--

2637
02:53:29,700 --> 02:53:31,914
LAURA: He's got legendary actions?

2638
02:53:31,914 --> 02:53:35,083
TRAVIS: Yep, and he resists the Grasping Vine.

2639
02:53:35,083 --> 02:53:38,893
LAURA: What a fucking dick!

2640
02:53:38,893 --> 02:53:42,299
TRAVIS: I know, unicorns, right? Fuck me.

2641
02:53:42,299 --> 02:53:49,840
LAURA: Fine, well, Grasping Vine is a bonus action.
I don't think he can resist it, but whatever.

2642
02:53:49,840 --> 02:53:53,932
TRAVIS: Are you a unicorn? Then how do you know?

2643
02:53:53,932 --> 02:53:56,851
LAURA: It's not like it's a spell effect, he has
to make a dexterity save.

2644
02:53:56,851 --> 02:53:58,706
TRAVIS: Are you arguing with the BM?

2645
02:53:58,706 --> 02:54:04,107
LAURA: Nope, not at all. Can I shoot him? No, I
don't want to shoot him! Can I talk to him?

2646
02:54:04,107 --> 02:54:05,511
TRAVIS: Sure.

2647
02:54:05,511 --> 02:54:11,348
LAURA: I want to say: Unicorn, why are you
attacking me? I don't want to fight you.

2648
02:54:11,348 --> 02:54:13,382
TRAVIS: What language are you speaking in?

2649
02:54:13,382 --> 02:54:16,776
LAURA: I'm speaking in Unicorn.

2650
02:54:16,776 --> 02:54:19,056
SAM: You already cast Speak With Animals today.

2651
02:54:19,056 --> 02:54:21,009
LIAM: Celestial for unicorn.

2652
02:54:21,009 --> 02:54:22,726
LAURA: I'm speaking in Unicorn.

2653
02:54:22,726 --> 02:54:24,103
LIAM: And your six seconds are up.

2654
02:54:24,103 --> 02:54:25,505
TRAVIS: That's not a language.

2655
02:54:25,505 --> 02:54:27,895
LAURA: Grog, how do you know it's not a language?

2656
02:54:27,895 --> 02:54:34,143
TRAVIS: I know these things. It's what I do. I
drink and I know things.

2657
02:54:34,143 --> 02:54:38,717
LAURA: All right, then I'm going to speak in
normal, and I'm speaking Elvish! I feel like

2658
02:54:38,717 --> 02:54:40,505
unicorns might be able to understand.

2659
02:54:40,505 --> 02:54:44,276
TRAVIS: Well, the unicorn speaks Celestial,
Elvish, Sylvan, and telepathy, but because you

2660
02:54:44,276 --> 02:54:47,463
just spoke in Common--

2661
02:54:47,463 --> 02:54:49,473
LAURA: I said Elvish.

2662
02:54:49,473 --> 02:54:53,001
TRAVIS: Good thing it understands you-- It has
telepathy!

2663
02:54:53,001 --> 02:54:57,505
LAURA: So I say: Why are you fighting me? Why? I
don't want to fight you. I don't want to hurt you.

2664
02:54:57,505 --> 02:54:58,776
I love you.

2665
02:54:58,776 --> 02:55:01,724
TRAVIS: And he's like, "I am a unicorn. There can
only be one."

2666
02:55:01,724 --> 02:55:05,525
(laughter)

2667
02:55:05,525 --> 02:55:07,297
LAURA: That's my whole turn.

2668
02:55:07,297 --> 02:55:09,256
LIAM: You know that was like 87 seconds.

2669
02:55:09,256 --> 02:55:11,098
TRAVIS: The T-rex will take its turn!

2670
02:55:11,098 --> 02:55:12,385
SAM: Bring it.

2671
02:55:12,385 --> 02:55:20,702
TRAVIS: It is going to run towards you with a
multi-attack on your carrion form. It's going to

2672
02:55:20,702 --> 02:55:25,348
make a bite attack first. That is an 18.

2673
02:55:25,348 --> 02:55:26,477
SAM: That hits.

2674
02:55:26,477 --> 02:55:30,747
TRAVIS: Yeah! Oh god. Okay.

2675
02:55:30,747 --> 02:55:38,586
TALIESIN: So much math.

2676
02:55:38,586 --> 02:55:48,106
TRAVIS: That is 36 points of damage. Does that
knock you out of your carrion form?

2677
02:55:48,106 --> 02:55:50,515
SAM: Oh yeah, I'm no longer a monkey.

2678
02:55:50,515 --> 02:55:56,011
TRAVIS: It's a bite, so you are in the jaws of a
T-rex, Scanlan.

2679
02:55:56,011 --> 02:55:59,388
TALIESIN: (squawks) I don't think they make that
noise, but--

2680
02:55:59,388 --> 02:56:01,091
LAURA: I don't think so. It sounded kind of like a
bird.

2681
02:56:01,091 --> 02:56:02,582
TALIESIN: They are very bird-like.

2682
02:56:02,582 --> 02:56:08,906
TRAVIS: And we are going to make a tail attack
against you. Oh, it's only 18 to hit.

2683
02:56:08,906 --> 02:56:13,691
SAM: Yeah, that hits. Scanlan has an AC of 14.

2684
02:56:13,691 --> 02:56:15,624
LAURA: What? That's so low.

2685
02:56:15,624 --> 02:56:21,678
TRAVIS: That is 28 points of damage as it smacks
you with its tail.

2686
02:56:21,678 --> 02:56:23,969
SAM: Great.

2687
02:56:23,969 --> 02:56:25,850
LAURA: How are you doing, Scanlan?

2688
02:56:25,850 --> 02:56:28,620
SAM: I'm still double digits.

2689
02:56:28,620 --> 02:56:32,000
TRAVIS: Next up: Vax.

2690
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:39,356
LIAM: All right. I regain one hit point as a
revenant. So that's going to make all the

2691
02:56:39,356 --> 02:56:48,944
difference. I use my action to cast a level one
druid spell, Faerie Fire, on this flying fucker.

2692
02:56:48,944 --> 02:56:53,584
It has to make a dex save versus my DC of 16.

2693
02:56:53,584 --> 02:56:55,017
TRAVIS: Okay.

2694
02:56:55,017 --> 02:56:56,705
LAURA: You really caught on.

2695
02:56:56,705 --> 02:56:58,063
LIAM: I did.

2696
02:56:58,063 --> 02:56:59,450
TRAVIS: That's an eight.

2697
02:56:59,450 --> 02:57:05,992
LIAM: Poof! Lit up like a disco ball, and I now
have advantage on the attack against it so I can

2698
02:57:05,992 --> 02:57:08,460
fucking sneak attack, which is going to be
clutch.

2699
02:57:08,460 --> 02:57:13,493
TRAVIS: Indeed. It stands there, not thinking much
of you and a burst of fiery light surrounds his

2700
02:57:13,493 --> 02:57:17,184
form. All of a sudden, you are very sure about
where to hit and how.

2701
02:57:17,184 --> 02:57:24,427
LIAM: Right in front of me, and I will use my
bonus action to throw a fucking dagger. Oh dear,

2702
02:57:24,427 --> 02:57:26,314
that is a 23 to hit.

2703
02:57:26,314 --> 02:57:27,524
TRAVIS: 23 hits.

2704
02:57:27,524 --> 02:57:46,872
LIAM: Yes, it does, and it gets (counting), plus
these guys. Jeez, that was a shitty roll. 33 and

2705
02:57:46,872 --> 02:58:00,762
I'm going to dump my other level two spell slot
for Divine Smite. 48 total from Whisper.

2706
02:58:00,833 --> 02:58:11,413
TRAVIS: 48 massive points of damage. Shit. Damn.
Cool. Sam. Scan! Lan. You're up!

2707
02:58:11,413 --> 02:58:21,911
SAM: (muttering) Challenge rating. Am I in its--

2708
02:58:21,911 --> 02:58:28,157
TRAVIS: No, it smacked you with its tail away. It
bit you, and then it was like (spits out), and hit

2709
02:58:28,157 --> 02:58:29,767
you with its ass extension.

2710
02:58:29,767 --> 02:58:34,882
SAM: All right, I'm contractually required to turn
into a triceratops.

2711
02:58:34,882 --> 02:58:39,247
TRAVIS: I mean, have you done that before?

2712
02:58:39,247 --> 02:58:40,500
SAM: Yeah.

2713
02:58:40,500 --> 02:58:46,155
TRAVIS: Great. I should have that, but I didn't
plan that far ahead. So we're going to turn you

2714
02:58:46,155 --> 02:58:47,494
into this--

2715
02:58:47,494 --> 02:58:49,013
SAM: This unicorn.

2716
02:58:49,013 --> 02:58:53,991
TRAVIS: This giant werebear looking fucking thing.
There you go.

2717
02:58:53,991 --> 02:59:09,590
SAM: Oh, before I did that, I Healing Worded
myself for like ten points of health there, as a

2718
02:59:09,590 --> 02:59:16,356
bonus. And now I am a triceratops and I will use
the rest of my turn to back into the corner.

2719
02:59:16,356 --> 02:59:19,044
TRAVIS: Okay, that's your turn.

2720
02:59:19,044 --> 02:59:20,811
SAM: Yeah, that's it.

2721
02:59:20,811 --> 02:59:36,897
TRAVIS: Okay, the cambion is up and he's going to
multi-attack against you. 16 will miss. 24?

2722
02:59:36,897 --> 02:59:39,922
LIAM: It will, but I'm going to use my last luck.
Roll again.

2723
02:59:39,922 --> 02:59:43,293
TRAVIS: Oh. 18?

2724
02:59:43,293 --> 02:59:44,570
LIAM: Does not hit.

2725
02:59:44,570 --> 02:59:50,417
TRAVIS: Nice. He has one last-- 25.

2726
02:59:50,417 --> 02:59:51,939
LIAM: Does hit.

2727
02:59:51,939 --> 02:59:54,486
TRAVIS: Great, you only get hit once though, which
is nice.

2728
02:59:54,486 --> 02:59:55,679
LIAM: What's it hit me with?

2729
02:59:55,679 --> 02:59:57,548
TRAVIS: He hits you with this fiery spear.

2730
02:59:57,548 --> 02:59:58,739
LIAM: All right.

2731
02:59:58,739 --> 03:00:08,207
TRAVIS: That is 16 points of fire and piercing
damage.

2732
03:00:08,207 --> 03:00:14,632
LIAM: Fire, so that'll be halved to eight? And
then it might be four, I'm going to look something

2733
03:00:14,632 --> 03:00:21,475
up really fucking quick. Uncanny dodge. I'm going
to halve that down to four.

2734
03:00:21,475 --> 03:00:28,038
TRAVIS: So four points of damage. There you go.
Brilliant. He's going to use his movement to--

2735
03:00:28,038 --> 03:00:35,715
Just right in your face! "Look how big my wings
are in comparison to yours!" It is now the

2736
03:00:35,715 --> 03:00:39,518
unicorn's turn. The unicorn rushes forward--

2737
03:00:39,518 --> 03:00:43,890
LIAM: Have you ever seen this unicorn before?

2738
03:00:43,890 --> 03:00:45,390
LAURA: No, I have no idea--

2739
03:00:45,390 --> 03:00:51,209
TRAVIS: He is going to make two hooved attacks
against you and a horn stabby in your face.

2740
03:00:51,209 --> 03:00:53,166
TALIESIN: Friendship is magic.

2741
03:00:53,166 --> 03:00:55,453
TRAVIS: That's true. 16?

2742
03:00:55,453 --> 03:00:56,747
LAURA: Doesn't hit.

2743
03:00:56,747 --> 03:00:59,733
TRAVIS: 25?

2744
03:00:59,733 --> 03:01:00,817
LAURA: That hits.

2745
03:01:00,817 --> 03:01:04,410
TRAVIS: And the horn. That hits.

2746
03:01:04,410 --> 03:01:05,537
LAURA: How do you know?

2747
03:01:05,537 --> 03:01:20,595
TRAVIS: Because it's 27. That is 19 points of
piercing and bludgeoning damage, respectively.

2748
03:01:20,595 --> 03:01:23,121
TALIESIN: Could be worse.

2749
03:01:23,121 --> 03:01:35,299
TRAVIS: And he will stay where he is. He will try
to stand up again. For the brave-- (gasps) He's a

2750
03:01:35,299 --> 03:01:37,638
show pony. Percy, you're up.

2751
03:01:37,638 --> 03:01:40,218
TALIESIN: I actually should be right in the face
of this terrible--

2752
03:01:40,218 --> 03:01:42,549
TRAVIS: Oh yes, sorry. You did stabby the fuck out
of him.

2753
03:01:42,549 --> 03:01:48,730
TALIESIN: I'm just going to keep stabby, stabby,
stabby. With advantage. So, stabby. Yes, that

2754
03:01:48,730 --> 03:01:58,412
hits. Stabby. Ooh, that's nice. That's crit-- Oh,
it's not crit because it's not a gun, it's just a

2755
03:01:58,412 --> 03:02:06,330
sword. And that's really hard to read, because
that's Scanlan's dice. My lowest number is 28 to hit.

2756
03:02:06,330 --> 03:02:09,373
TRAVIS: They all hit, very hard.

2757
03:02:09,373 --> 03:02:13,762
LAURA: It is really pretty though, Scanlan.

2758
03:02:13,762 --> 03:02:16,485
SAM: Thank you.

2759
03:02:16,485 --> 03:02:22,032
LIAM: The triceratops diddles his iPhone in the
corner.

2760
03:02:22,032 --> 03:02:24,068
SAM: I'm looking up all my stats.

2761
03:02:24,068 --> 03:02:25,642
TALIESIN: 36 points of damage.

2762
03:02:25,642 --> 03:02:28,893
SAM: I haven't been a triceratops in over a year.

2763
03:02:28,893 --> 03:02:32,835
TALIESIN: Is he still just doing that, just
there?

2764
03:02:32,835 --> 03:02:40,468
TRAVIS: Yep. He looks like he is quite surprised
as to why he's there in the first fucking place,

2765
03:02:40,468 --> 03:02:41,848
and that you are--

2766
03:02:41,848 --> 03:02:45,559
TALIESIN: I'm just going to add a little bit of
extra damage on there with my Hex. So let's just

2767
03:02:45,559 --> 03:02:55,333
add five points of lightning damage as well, for
fun. 14 points of lightning damage on top of that.

2768
03:02:55,333 --> 03:03:09,131
TRAVIS: He will react to that extra salvo,
(snarls) with all his stupid things.

2769
03:03:09,131 --> 03:03:10,639
TALIESIN: Try and mental me or anything?

2770
03:03:10,639 --> 03:03:17,131
TRAVIS: He is going to use Mind Blast right at
you. I need you to roll an intelligence saving throw.

2771
03:03:17,131 --> 03:03:20,868
TALIESIN: All right. I can do that.

2772
03:03:20,868 --> 03:03:27,380
TRAVIS: Wasn't it you that he tried to suck the
brain out of before?

2773
03:03:27,380 --> 03:03:29,020
LAURA: That was Scanlan.

2774
03:03:29,020 --> 03:03:31,427
TALIESIN: Intelligence saving throw, that's 23.

2775
03:03:31,427 --> 03:03:40,182
TRAVIS: Yeah, that doesn't happen at all. Cool.
Good deal. He is going to make a simple melee

2776
03:03:40,182 --> 03:03:41,495
attack against you.

2777
03:03:41,495 --> 03:03:43,132
TALIESIN: Oh no, he's not. He's restrained.

2778
03:03:43,132 --> 03:03:48,090
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, he's restrained. He's just, like,
baffled by how dominant you are in this whole thing.

2779
03:03:48,090 --> 03:03:51,050
TALIESIN: I'm just going to keep stabbing him in
the face over and over again.

2780
03:03:51,050 --> 03:03:56,491
TRAVIS: Yeah, he really wishes he wasn't here
right now. He's not sure who he pissed off. Vex,

2781
03:03:56,491 --> 03:03:57,465
you're up.

2782
03:03:57,465 --> 03:04:00,298
LAURA: Yeah! Am I still entangled?

2783
03:04:00,298 --> 03:04:03,123
TRAVIS: Oh, make a strength saving throw.

2784
03:04:03,123 --> 03:04:15,016
LAURA: Saving throw? That would be 19.

2785
03:04:15,016 --> 03:04:19,913
TRAVIS: You break free of the vines and they
wither and die in the ground.

2786
03:04:19,913 --> 03:04:25,626
LAURA: I'm going to use my bonus action to use the
Grasping Vine again and try to wrap right around

2787
03:04:25,626 --> 03:04:27,286
his leg and yank him back.

2788
03:04:27,286 --> 03:04:31,201
TRAVIS: Great. I roll, don't I? What is it?

2789
03:04:31,201 --> 03:04:35,954
LAURA: That is a dex save.

2790
03:04:35,954 --> 03:04:38,044
TRAVIS: That's a seven.

2791
03:04:38,044 --> 03:04:41,752
LAURA: Oh, then he's restrained. Or he's pulled
back at least.

2792
03:04:41,752 --> 03:04:43,341
TRAVIS: He's pulled back on his heinies.

2793
03:04:43,341 --> 03:04:53,060
LAURA: Yeah! So it falls over, it's all right. And
then I'm going to cast Speak with Animals,

2794
03:04:53,060 --> 03:04:55,810
although I don't need to because he already--

2795
03:04:55,810 --> 03:04:57,509
TRAVIS: Speaks more languages than you do.

2796
03:04:57,509 --> 03:05:03,089
LAURA: And I'm going to say: You're a very good
creature. I know you're lawful. What are you doing

2797
03:05:03,089 --> 03:05:05,092
fighting me? I'm good too!

2798
03:05:05,092 --> 03:05:07,094
TRAVIS: (hums)

2799
03:05:07,094 --> 03:05:11,194
LAURA: Anything? No response?

2800
03:05:11,194 --> 03:05:12,991
TRAVIS: I mean, on his turn he might.

2801
03:05:12,991 --> 03:05:19,656
LAURA: Okay, just know that I don't want to attack
you, I'd rather just ride around on you, because

2802
03:05:19,656 --> 03:05:21,226
you seem really beautiful.

2803
03:05:21,226 --> 03:05:24,393
SAM: One more time, just not trying to kill you.

2804
03:05:24,393 --> 03:05:30,103
LAURA: And then for my movement, I'm going to hop
on my broom and fly up in the air.

2805
03:05:30,103 --> 03:05:31,674
TRAVIS: How high?

2806
03:05:31,674 --> 03:05:38,875
LAURA: Not quite to the top of the tower. How high
does the tower go?

2807
03:05:38,875 --> 03:05:41,290
TRAVIS: Looks like it's 120 feet to the top of the
tower.

2808
03:05:41,290 --> 03:05:42,772
LAURA: I'm going to just go up 40 feet.

2809
03:05:42,772 --> 03:05:48,754
TRAVIS: That's good. At 40 feet you are hovering
up at the top of the tower, and you hear somewhere

2810
03:05:48,754 --> 03:05:53,463
above you a buzz of energy. I don't know how many
this is.

2811
03:05:53,463 --> 03:05:55,253
LAURA: Ooh, you have them!

2812
03:05:55,253 --> 03:05:56,877
TRAVIS: Well they're over here, so fuck it.

2813
03:05:56,877 --> 03:05:59,893
LAURA: Wait, maybe flip it over.

2814
03:05:59,893 --> 03:06:02,985
SAM: You got it wrong.

2815
03:06:02,985 --> 03:06:07,950
LAURA: That's it!

2816
03:06:07,950 --> 03:06:17,510
TRAVIS: How's this shit work? What was wrong with
the first way I was doing this? Here, you're

2817
03:06:17,510 --> 03:06:20,701
flying 40 feet in the air. Sam, make that work.

2818
03:06:20,701 --> 03:06:24,080
SAM: We are missing a piece.

2819
03:06:24,080 --> 03:06:27,589
TRAVIS: Oh, here, there's a base over here!

2820
03:06:27,589 --> 03:06:29,091
LIAM: There you go!

2821
03:06:29,091 --> 03:06:36,855
TRAVIS: I'm sure there's a certain number of
things you've got to count, but-- That's really high.

2822
03:06:36,855 --> 03:06:45,913
LAURA: Yeah (counting). I'm about ten feet higher
than I should be.

2823
03:06:45,913 --> 03:06:55,445
TRAVIS: You hear a buzz of energy above you, but
you seem to be fine. Scanlan. No, Vax. No, T-rex!

2824
03:06:55,445 --> 03:07:10,955
T-rex charges forward towards the triceratops,
nurturing its ancient rivalry with such a foe. It

2825
03:07:10,955 --> 03:07:17,115
will make a multi-attack. It will bitch slap you
with its tail. 25.

2826
03:07:17,115 --> 03:07:18,261
SAM: That hits.

2827
03:07:18,261 --> 03:07:32,338
TRAVIS: For 23 points of bludgeoning damage. And
it will make a bite attack against you. 21.

2828
03:07:32,338 --> 03:07:33,620
SAM: Hits.

2829
03:07:33,620 --> 03:07:45,384
TRAVIS: 4d12 plus seven. I suck at subtraction
math. Adding, I'm okay. That is 37 points--

2830
03:07:45,384 --> 03:07:47,077
SAM: Whoa!

2831
03:07:47,077 --> 03:07:50,764
TRAVIS: Of piercing damage.

2832
03:07:50,764 --> 03:07:52,609
SAM: Great.

2833
03:07:52,609 --> 03:07:55,929
TRAVIS: Good. Oh, you're a triceratops, you're all
sorts of muscled up.

2834
03:07:55,929 --> 03:07:57,456
SAM: A little bit.

2835
03:07:57,456 --> 03:08:02,141
TRAVIS: Nice. Vax, it is your turn. He's just
going to be like (grunts).

2836
03:08:02,141 --> 03:08:13,238
LIAM: I'm going to use a level one spell slot and
cast Faerie Fire again on the illithid by Freddie.

2837
03:08:13,238 --> 03:08:16,805
So it has to save versus a 16.

2838
03:08:16,805 --> 03:08:22,396
TRAVIS: As you go to cast Faerie Fire, you see it
disperse along the barrier wall between your

2839
03:08:22,396 --> 03:08:24,599
section and his. Unaffected.

2840
03:08:24,599 --> 03:08:30,345
LIAM: I thought that would affect physical, not
magical. All right, well then I will fuck this guy

2841
03:08:30,345 --> 03:08:35,768
up in front of me then. That's a 23?

2842
03:08:35,768 --> 03:08:37,219
TRAVIS: 23 hits.

2843
03:08:37,219 --> 03:08:57,409
LIAM: 19, that's good. 36 total. And I'll just
stick it out right in front of him.

2844
03:08:57,409 --> 03:09:02,849
TRAVIS: He's looking very rough. Scanlan, your
turn.

2845
03:09:02,849 --> 03:09:13,486
SAM: Without leaving his attack range, and thus
not provoking an attack of opportunity I hope, I'm

2846
03:09:13,486 --> 03:09:29,673
going to charge for his leg and hit it with a gore
attack. So I'm going to move down the line and

2847
03:09:29,673 --> 03:09:36,435
attack his leg. Rolling a two. Plus nine.

2848
03:09:36,435 --> 03:09:41,227
TRAVIS: A two! The triceratops runs forward. No
effect.

2849
03:09:41,227 --> 03:09:43,022
SAM: End of turn.

2850
03:09:43,022 --> 03:09:46,708
TRAVIS: (laughs) That's what the triceratops has
got?

2851
03:09:46,708 --> 03:09:54,458
LIAM: That was Sam as Scanlan as Scanlan as T-rex
as bear.

2852
03:09:54,458 --> 03:10:03,464
TRAVIS: Okay, the cambion getting its ass handed
to it by Vax will look him in the face, and it

2853
03:10:03,464 --> 03:10:08,833
will cast Command at-- let's say fourth level.

2854
03:10:08,833 --> 03:10:18,240
LIAM: What, to fly into the wall over and over
again?

2855
03:10:18,240 --> 03:10:20,390
TRAVIS: You need to roll a constitution saving
throw.

2856
03:10:20,390 --> 03:10:25,184
LIAM: Okay, Colville, it's up to you. Not good.
Eight-- 15.

2857
03:10:25,184 --> 03:10:31,424
TRAVIS: 15, not good. He commands you to grovel in
front of him, and all of a sudden you feel this

2858
03:10:31,424 --> 03:10:37,421
overwhelming urge. You drop to your knees and you
lay prone right in front of him, not able to get up.

2859
03:10:37,421 --> 03:10:43,995
LIAM: I don't understand this game! The rules
don't make sense! Can I have some XBs, please? Can

2860
03:10:43,995 --> 03:10:46,229
I have some XBs?

2861
03:10:46,229 --> 03:10:54,171
TRAVIS: I'm a fan of puns, you get ten XPs. He
will have advantage on his flaming spear attack

2862
03:10:54,171 --> 03:10:55,604
against you.

2863
03:10:55,604 --> 03:10:59,363
TRAVIS: That's a natural 20.

2864
03:10:59,363 --> 03:11:02,463
LIAM: Sure.

2865
03:11:02,463 --> 03:11:04,857
TRAVIS: It was advantage.

2866
03:11:04,857 --> 03:11:10,476
LIAM: Sure. What a good idea, to grovel.

2867
03:11:10,476 --> 03:11:17,406
TRAVIS: 39 points of piercing and fire damage,
which is halved.

2868
03:11:17,406 --> 03:11:19,065
LIAM: But which part of it?

2869
03:11:19,065 --> 03:11:20,221
TRAVIS: Well, I don't know.

2870
03:11:20,221 --> 03:11:22,993
LIAM: Just give me a number, Grog. You're the
mathematician.

2871
03:11:22,993 --> 03:11:27,386
TRAVIS: Let's call it 20, down to 20. Let's call
it 19 points.

2872
03:11:27,386 --> 03:11:32,070
LIAM: Okay, I would've got back a hit point,
because I'm a revenant. So that's 41, so I'm

2873
03:11:32,070 --> 03:11:33,286
sitting pretty.

2874
03:11:33,286 --> 03:11:41,687
TRAVIS: Good deal. There you are. Next up is the
unicorn. Having heard your humanitarian pleas for

2875
03:11:41,687 --> 03:11:42,779
peace--

2876
03:11:42,779 --> 03:11:47,595
LAURA: He's also stuck in that position because of
the Grasping Vine.

2877
03:11:47,595 --> 03:11:56,977
TRAVIS: Casts Levitate. Kidding, he doesn't have
Levitate. Why did I move him? He's there. The

2878
03:11:56,977 --> 03:12:05,614
unicorn who's stuck, which I totally forgot about,
will use... Ooh! Yes! Teleport! He casts

2879
03:12:05,614 --> 03:12:06,648
Teleport.

2880
03:12:06,648 --> 03:12:07,954
LAURA: Where? Where does he go?

2881
03:12:07,954 --> 03:12:12,075
TRAVIS: Once a day he magically teleports himself
within five feet of where he was.

2882
03:12:12,075 --> 03:12:14,762
LIAM: Within five feet of where he was?

2883
03:12:14,762 --> 03:12:15,956
TRAVIS: Poof!

2884
03:12:15,956 --> 03:12:20,563
(laughter)

2885
03:12:20,563 --> 03:12:24,216
SAM: Wait, five feet Teleport? What spell is
that?!

2886
03:12:24,216 --> 03:12:28,838
TRAVIS: No, any willing creatures within five
feet, but that's what I saw first, so that's the

2887
03:12:28,838 --> 03:12:35,539
rule. It can go up to a mile away, but it's five
feet.

2888
03:12:35,539 --> 03:12:41,122
(laughter)

2889
03:12:41,122 --> 03:12:47,066
TRAVIS: It will use its horn of rainbow attack
against you.

2890
03:12:47,066 --> 03:12:48,462
LAURA: Oh no.

2891
03:12:48,462 --> 03:12:53,145
TRAVIS: That is a 23.

2892
03:12:53,145 --> 03:12:55,044
LAURA: Ugh, it fucking hits me.

2893
03:12:55,044 --> 03:13:07,520
TRAVIS: That is 22 points of damage. That ends its
turn. Percy, you are up.

2894
03:13:07,520 --> 03:13:09,745
TALIESIN: I'm just going to stab him three more
times.

2895
03:13:09,745 --> 03:13:12,439
LAURA: Do need to make a dexterity save to see if
I stay on my broom?

2896
03:13:12,439 --> 03:13:15,149
TRAVIS: Nope. You take it like a champ.

2897
03:13:15,149 --> 03:13:20,951
TALIESIN: Three more attacks. That's 21 to hit.

2898
03:13:20,951 --> 03:13:28,306
TRAVIS: That hits. If those two hit, just roll
damage for those two.

2899
03:13:28,306 --> 03:13:30,073
TALIESIN: They all hit.

2900
03:13:30,073 --> 03:13:31,847
TRAVIS: He's looking pretty gross.

2901
03:13:31,847 --> 03:13:43,873
TALIESIN: Oh, that's terrible. 28 points of
piercing damage.

2902
03:13:43,873 --> 03:13:49,880
TRAVIS: With the sword, right? As you take your
silvered sword and repeatedly jam it into his

2903
03:13:49,880 --> 03:13:56,748
general thorax and face, repeatedly-- Tentacles
falling off like freshly cut sushi, he just falls

2904
03:13:56,748 --> 03:14:05,074
backwards, guts spewing like Stephen King's The
Thing. He is toast.

2905
03:14:05,074 --> 03:14:07,173
LIAM: (as Clarota) Go fuck yourself.

2906
03:14:07,173 --> 03:14:13,082
TALIESIN: For my bonus action I'm going to retract
my little Manners ball, and then I'm going to

2907
03:14:13,082 --> 03:14:16,535
walk, and attempt to tap the wall to
see if it's still standing.

2908
03:14:16,535 --> 03:14:23,101
TRAVIS: As you walk to the wall, you notice that
there seems to be no force field on your side of

2909
03:14:23,101 --> 03:14:24,656
the tower.

2910
03:14:24,656 --> 03:14:27,738
TALIESIN: I'm actually in the far corner, put me
behind the unicorn, please.

2911
03:14:27,738 --> 03:14:34,319
TRAVIS: Oh, you tapped this one. I got you. You seem
to see no effect.

2912
03:14:34,319 --> 03:14:36,651
TALIESIN: All right, good. That's the end of my
turn.

2913
03:14:36,651 --> 03:14:38,268
TRAVIS: Vex.

2914
03:14:38,268 --> 03:14:48,885
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to take the greater healing
potion. Which is 4d4.

2915
03:14:48,885 --> 03:14:52,335
TRAVIS: You better attack this fucking unicorn.

2916
03:14:52,335 --> 03:15:07,149
LAURA: Whoa, that's a really good 14 points plus
four, right? So 18 points healed. And then I'm

2917
03:15:07,149 --> 03:15:20,958
going to fly over the unicorn, and drop down,
landing on its back! And I'm going to use my Rope

2918
03:15:20,958 --> 03:15:27,343
of Entanglement to make like a harness thing and
hold on to the fucking unicorn like a fucking

2919
03:15:27,343 --> 03:15:28,584
rodeo.

2920
03:15:28,584 --> 03:15:29,986
SAM: Why aren't you killing the unicorn?

2921
03:15:29,986 --> 03:15:31,629
LAURA: Because he's lawful good.

2922
03:15:31,629 --> 03:15:34,225
TRAVIS: I need you to make an acrobatics check.

2923
03:15:34,225 --> 03:15:42,694
LAURA: Okay. That would be a one. (laughs)

2924
03:15:42,694 --> 03:15:46,705
SAM: Please tell me she falls on the horn.

2925
03:15:46,705 --> 03:15:48,788
TALIESIN: This is everything I've ever wanted.

2926
03:15:48,788 --> 03:15:54,969
TRAVIS: You plummet, falling toward its head. And at
the last moment, having been affected by your

2927
03:15:54,969 --> 03:16:05,531
wonderful message, it looks up. And you find
yourself impaled, gored on its horn! It even

2928
03:16:05,531 --> 03:16:07,239
jumps up and spins!

2929
03:16:07,239 --> 03:16:09,882
SAM: Like Free Willy!

2930
03:16:09,882 --> 03:16:12,376
LAURA: I deserve that.

2931
03:16:12,376 --> 03:16:20,998
TRAVIS: You will take, jeez, 18 points of piercing
damage.

2932
03:16:20,998 --> 03:16:25,132
LAURA: Right back down to where I was before I
healed. But thank god I healed!

2933
03:16:25,132 --> 03:16:32,195
TRAVIS: You just manage to roll off the horn,
laying on your back across its mane. Not riding

2934
03:16:32,195 --> 03:16:34,109
it, but just there for the moment.

2935
03:16:34,109 --> 03:16:35,889
LAURA: Am I on my back or on my stomach?

2936
03:16:35,889 --> 03:16:43,175
TRAVIS: You're on your back, in a very
uncomfortable arched position. The T-rex turns!

2937
03:16:43,175 --> 03:16:49,248
Tail whip!

2938
03:16:49,248 --> 03:16:50,755
SAM: (screech)

2939
03:16:50,755 --> 03:17:01,696
TRAVIS: That is 26 points of bludgeoning damage,
and the bite attack against you--

2940
03:17:01,696 --> 03:17:09,773
SAM: Wait, you have to roll to hit.

2941
03:17:09,773 --> 03:17:13,968
TRAVIS: Oh shit, fuck. Oh, 17.

2942
03:17:13,968 --> 03:17:15,013
SAM: Hits.

2943
03:17:15,013 --> 03:17:17,585
TRAVIS: Okay, that is 39 points of piercing
damage.

2944
03:17:17,585 --> 03:17:20,563
SAM: Okay, back to Scanlan.

2945
03:17:20,563 --> 03:17:28,703
TRAVIS: Oh yeah? Vax, you are prone and up.

2946
03:17:28,703 --> 03:17:35,190
LIAM: I will use half my movement to stand. And
then I will use the other half of my movement,

2947
03:17:35,190 --> 03:17:40,593
which winged is 30 feet, and fly up to this
asshole. And I will use a bonus action to down

2948
03:17:40,593 --> 03:17:55,910
that potion that I grabbed, which is 4d4 plus
four. So that's (counting) 14. And then I will

2949
03:17:55,910 --> 03:18:04,261
stab this asshole in the asshole. That is a 33 to
hit.

2950
03:18:04,261 --> 03:18:05,955
TRAVIS: An asshole for an asshole. That hits.

2951
03:18:05,955 --> 03:18:16,610
LIAM: All right, here we go. (counting) And then
here come all the d6s.

2952
03:18:16,610 --> 03:18:18,756
TRAVIS: Jesus.

2953
03:18:18,756 --> 03:18:26,194
LIAM: (counting) 44, and I will dump--

2954
03:18:26,194 --> 03:18:30,191
TRAVIS: You're very good at adding all those dice
for someone who's never played this game before.

2955
03:18:30,191 --> 03:18:34,952
LIAM: I'm good at math, I'm not good at whatever
the fuck this game is. This is the best game,

2956
03:18:34,952 --> 03:18:38,935
though. So it's in the high 40s, you made me lose
track. I'm going to say 49.

2957
03:18:38,935 --> 03:18:43,023
TRAVIS: I'll take it. Oh god. Any other attacks
after that?

2958
03:18:43,023 --> 03:18:49,039
LIAM: Yeah. Not much. That is 26 to hit.

2959
03:18:49,039 --> 03:18:50,197
TRAVIS: Yep, hits.

2960
03:18:50,197 --> 03:18:59,141
LIAM: Seven, and I will dump my last spell slot
in. 17.

2961
03:18:59,141 --> 03:19:03,904
TRAVIS: And with that, the dagger pierces through
the armor. And you hear (snarls) as a spurt of

2962
03:19:03,904 --> 03:19:13,503
black blood comes out of its mouth. Its wings fall
to the side. And it's like, "How did you..." And

2963
03:19:13,503 --> 03:19:15,118
falls over dead.

2964
03:19:15,118 --> 03:19:18,769
LIAM: Slow dance down to the ground.

2965
03:19:18,769 --> 03:19:23,505
SAM: Meanwhile, me and Laura still haven't dealt
any damage to ours at all.

2966
03:19:23,505 --> 03:19:25,457
TRAVIS: Scanlan, you're up.

2967
03:19:25,457 --> 03:19:27,921
TALIESIN: There's a Tyrannosaurus rex and a
unicorn that still need to be dealt with.

2968
03:19:27,921 --> 03:19:29,451
SAM: Put Scanlan back on there.

2969
03:19:29,451 --> 03:19:31,783
TRAVIS: Oh yeah! Where is Scanlan?

2970
03:19:31,783 --> 03:19:35,488
LIAM: Very quickly, covered in gore, Freddie and
Vax nod.

2971
03:19:35,488 --> 03:19:37,654
TALIESIN: Quite proper.

2972
03:19:37,654 --> 03:19:51,681
SAM: As a bonus action, I will 2nd-level Healing
Word myself. Need to do that. That's seven plus

2973
03:19:51,681 --> 03:20:03,949
six. Oh, that's 13 points, that helped. And I will
just step back a little, not a lot. Then I will

2974
03:20:03,949 --> 03:20:08,859
cast Reverse Gravity and send him skyward.

2975
03:20:08,859 --> 03:20:16,105
(laughter)

2976
03:20:16,105 --> 03:20:20,771
SAM: He has to make a dexterity saving throw
against 22. But he's dexterous, it could work.

2977
03:20:20,771 --> 03:20:23,696
TRAVIS: Six.

2978
03:20:23,696 --> 03:20:29,742
SAM: Does it hurt him to hit the top?

2979
03:20:29,742 --> 03:20:35,625
TRAVIS: Yes. In fact, you see ripples of
energy just going out. And you start to smell

2980
03:20:35,625 --> 03:20:41,963
fried alligator. He falls 50 feet.

2981
03:20:41,963 --> 03:20:47,393
LIAM: (sings Jurassic Park theme)

2982
03:20:47,393 --> 03:20:50,350
TRAVIS: 25. Damn it, he's barely-- (groans)

2983
03:20:50,350 --> 03:20:56,334
SAM: He would actually technically not fall. He
just stays there.

2984
03:20:56,334 --> 03:21:01,228
TRAVIS: Oh really? So each round he'll take more
of that energy damage. Fair enough.

2985
03:21:01,228 --> 03:21:05,225
SAM: He stays there for a minute. So that's ten
rounds of damage.

2986
03:21:05,225 --> 03:21:16,746
TRAVIS: The unicorn, feeling this upside-down
half-elf on his back, shakes you off.

2987
03:21:16,746 --> 03:21:22,447
LAURA: No! Can I try to hang on? I want to try to
hang on to his hair!

2988
03:21:22,447 --> 03:21:26,800
TRAVIS: Sure. Roll an athletics check with
disadvantage.

2989
03:21:26,800 --> 03:21:31,287
LAURA: Well, I don't need to roll the other one,
because it's a one.

2990
03:21:31,287 --> 03:21:39,237
TRAVIS: Well, there you go. You fall-- Yeah, there
you go.

2991
03:21:39,237 --> 03:21:44,572
(laughter)

2992
03:21:44,572 --> 03:21:47,095
LAURA: Oh no, am I getting eaten by the unicorn?

2993
03:21:47,095 --> 03:22:00,649
TRAVIS: The unicorn comes over, and begins to
smell the fallen half-elf. "You showed me great

2994
03:22:00,649 --> 03:22:10,121
"respect, Vex'ahlia. Your kindness will live
throughout the ages. All the unicorns will be told

2995
03:22:10,121 --> 03:22:18,966
"of your mercy." And it kneels down and touches its
horn to the ground, and all of the enemies

2996
03:22:18,966 --> 03:22:20,978
disappear.

2997
03:22:20,978 --> 03:22:22,857
LIAM: Well earned.

2998
03:22:22,857 --> 03:22:26,093
LAURA: Thank you! It worked!

2999
03:22:26,093 --> 03:22:31,955
TRAVIS: You also see a similar shimmer disappear
from the barriers, and you can see the stones on

3000
03:22:31,955 --> 03:22:34,037
the tower even more clearly than ever before.

3001
03:22:34,037 --> 03:22:35,646
SAM: What do they look like?

3002
03:22:35,646 --> 03:22:37,240
TRAVIS: Like stones.

3003
03:22:37,240 --> 03:22:40,342
LAURA: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself at
3rd-level.

3004
03:22:40,342 --> 03:22:43,944
TALIESIN: I'm going to go take a look at that body
that was sitting in the--

3005
03:22:43,944 --> 03:22:53,298
TRAVIS: Yes. Percy, you get over, and you see what
seems to be some sort of humanoid figure. Roll a

3006
03:22:53,298 --> 03:22:54,719
perception check.

3007
03:22:54,719 --> 03:23:01,879
TALIESIN: That's not great. 14.

3008
03:23:01,879 --> 03:23:14,649
TRAVIS: You see tattered clothes, but you also see
slashes and big gashes and flesh peeling back.

3009
03:23:14,649 --> 03:23:21,568
There's also bits of hair, multicolored, and big
gashes in the floor. There's tons of gore, but it

3010
03:23:21,568 --> 03:23:26,045
does appear as if whatever this was was mauled by
something, almost.

3011
03:23:26,045 --> 03:23:28,941
TALIESIN: How big is this body, approximately?

3012
03:23:28,941 --> 03:23:31,303
TRAVIS: Very close to your own. Very similar.

3013
03:23:31,303 --> 03:23:35,723
SAM: Any clothing that we recognize?

3014
03:23:35,723 --> 03:23:37,622
TALIESIN: I don't know, take a look.

3015
03:23:37,622 --> 03:23:39,148
SAM: I'll come look.

3016
03:23:39,148 --> 03:23:41,136
LIAM: My wounds are starting to heal up somewhat.

3017
03:23:41,136 --> 03:23:42,558
TRAVIS: Yeah, because they do that.

3018
03:23:42,558 --> 03:23:43,897
SAM: Seven perception.

3019
03:23:43,897 --> 03:23:55,471
TRAVIS: You come over and you're like, those are
fucking clothes. Old brigade navy and, you know,

3020
03:23:55,471 --> 03:23:58,915
all sorts of stuff that you kind of recognize but
not really.

3021
03:23:58,915 --> 03:24:03,443
LAURA: Can I bamf Trinket out and see if he
recognizes the scent?

3022
03:24:03,443 --> 03:24:10,254
TRAVIS: Yeah, you bamf Trinket out of the
necklace, and he's like, whoa, unicorn piss! And

3023
03:24:10,254 --> 03:24:14,911
he goes right back in the necklace because I don't
know where he went-- There he is. He's out.

3024
03:24:14,911 --> 03:24:23,888
LAURA: Can he smell for perception on the body to
see if he recognizes who it is? Yeah, he has smell

3025
03:24:23,888 --> 03:24:25,077
perception.

3026
03:24:25,077 --> 03:24:27,941
TRAVIS: Yeah, roll the whatever that is. He's got
that?

3027
03:24:27,941 --> 03:24:29,334
LAURA: He's got advantage on smell perception.

3028
03:24:29,334 --> 03:24:34,766
TRAVIS: Yeah, go for it, advantage style. What?

3029
03:24:34,766 --> 03:24:35,847
LAURA: Does that count?

3030
03:24:35,847 --> 03:24:36,947
TRAVIS: Did you roll it on purpose?

3031
03:24:36,947 --> 03:24:38,332
LAURA: No, but it's a natural 20!

3032
03:24:38,332 --> 03:24:39,927
TRAVIS: No, you've got to roll it on purpose!

3033
03:24:39,927 --> 03:24:42,191
LAURA: Damn it.

3034
03:24:42,191 --> 03:24:45,143
SAM: I'm going to inspire the bear.

3035
03:24:45,143 --> 03:24:47,401
LAURA: What does that mean?

3036
03:24:47,401 --> 03:24:49,016
SAM: I'm going to inspire the bear.

3037
03:24:49,016 --> 03:24:50,425
TRAVIS: How do you do that?

3038
03:24:50,425 --> 03:24:52,008
SAM: By feeding it meat.

3039
03:24:52,008 --> 03:24:54,691
LAURA: Okay. (gasps)

3040
03:24:54,691 --> 03:24:59,117
SAM: Go on, Trinket. Smell real well tonight,
Trinket!

3041
03:24:59,117 --> 03:25:02,187
TRAVIS: Trinket takes the meat and just starts
gobbling it down.

3042
03:25:02,187 --> 03:25:10,375
SAM: And I will actually inspire the bear.

3043
03:25:10,375 --> 03:25:13,576
LAURA: Great. So 26.

3044
03:25:13,576 --> 03:25:21,410
TRAVIS: Trinket comes over and he begins sniffing
the body, and he does recognize some of the scent.

3045
03:25:21,410 --> 03:25:30,358
It's almost that of an animal, like perhaps
another bear, or a wolf even. Some sort of animal

3046
03:25:30,358 --> 03:25:42,341
scent on the body. Right then, Trinket (groans)
and this little hairball covered in mucus comes out.

3047
03:25:42,341 --> 03:25:45,219
LAURA: What's going on?

3048
03:25:45,219 --> 03:25:46,692
SAM I don't know!

3049
03:25:46,692 --> 03:25:50,824
TRAVIS: (bear dry heaving)

3050
03:25:50,824 --> 03:25:54,100
(laughter)

3051
03:25:54,100 --> 03:25:57,551
TRAVIS: And you flip Trinket over on his back and
pat his stomach.

3052
03:25:57,551 --> 03:26:01,651
LIAM: I would like, not in the game but out of the
game, to hide.

3053
03:26:01,651 --> 03:26:06,865
SAM: Oh no, does anyone know CP-bear?

3054
03:26:06,865 --> 03:26:20,789
TRAVIS: That's what our dachshund does. Trinket
takes 27 points of poison damage.

3055
03:26:20,789 --> 03:26:25,200
LAURA: I think he's dead.

3056
03:26:25,200 --> 03:26:30,057
TALIESIN: Well, he's unconscious. I think he goes
back into the necklace.

3057
03:26:30,057 --> 03:26:34,132
LAURA: Yeah, but I'm going to kill Scanlan
anyway.

3058
03:26:34,132 --> 03:26:43,314
TRAVIS: Hold on. So Trinket (groans). Face first,
ass up in the air, and goes back into your

3059
03:26:43,314 --> 03:26:44,875
necklace.

3060
03:26:44,875 --> 03:26:58,335
LAURA: I bamf him back out and heal him. I cast
Cure Wounds at 3rd-level. What are you doing down

3061
03:26:58,335 --> 03:26:59,590
on the ground?

3062
03:26:59,590 --> 03:27:01,912
LIAM: I'm hiding because you're going to murder
our friend.

3063
03:27:01,912 --> 03:27:07,695
SAM: I don't what's happened to your bear!
Something's wrong with him!

3064
03:27:07,695 --> 03:27:11,860
TRAVIS: Trinket heals 15 points. Do you leave him
out?

3065
03:27:11,860 --> 03:27:15,659
LAURA: Yeah, I leave him out, and I cast Speak
with Animals on him.

3066
03:27:15,659 --> 03:27:17,105
SAM: I think you've done that already today.

3067
03:27:17,105 --> 03:27:22,008
LAURA: And I have another one, you dick! It only
lasts ten minutes. And I go: Trinket, what

3068
03:27:22,008 --> 03:27:23,159
happened?

3069
03:27:23,159 --> 03:27:31,378
TRAVIS: "Well, I had the worst stomachache. I
don't know, I ate that meatball from Scanlan and

3070
03:27:31,378 --> 03:27:42,111
"then I fucking died. I don't want to make any
assumptions, but--"

3071
03:27:42,111 --> 03:27:53,192
(laughter)

3072
03:27:53,192 --> 03:28:02,523
LAURA: Scanlan! Did you kill my bear? Did you kill
him? Why would you do that?

3073
03:28:02,523 --> 03:28:09,035
SAM: I-- (laughs)

3074
03:28:09,035 --> 03:28:11,365
TALIESIN: Who betrayed this grizzly murder?

3075
03:28:11,365 --> 03:28:20,815
SAM: (wheezing) I don't know! I mean, maybe it was
something else? Maybe it was the unicorn?

3076
03:28:20,815 --> 03:28:22,919
LAURA: I try to put Scanlan in the necklace.

3077
03:28:22,919 --> 03:28:28,281
TRAVIS: How does that shit work? You've got the
card, right?

3078
03:28:28,281 --> 03:28:30,555
LAURA: I think he has to be willing.

3079
03:28:30,555 --> 03:28:32,183
TRAVIS: Scanlan, make a deception check.

3080
03:28:32,183 --> 03:28:46,186
SAM: It was the unicorn's powerful magic.
Deception check? 33.

3081
03:28:46,186 --> 03:28:53,706
TRAVIS: He really doesn't know. He doesn't know
what Trinket's talking about.

3082
03:28:53,706 --> 03:28:56,821
LAURA: So I don't try to put him in the necklace?
But don't I have to roll?

3083
03:28:56,821 --> 03:29:00,015
SAM: You can beat my deception. You can roll
against it, right?

3084
03:29:00,015 --> 03:29:06,951
LAURA: Well, I can. But you have to roll a DC
wisdom save.

3085
03:29:06,951 --> 03:29:09,595
TRAVIS: Just roll a wisdom saving throw.

3086
03:29:09,595 --> 03:29:14,182
SAM: What's the DC?

3087
03:29:14,182 --> 03:29:16,014
LAURA: Ten.

3088
03:29:16,014 --> 03:29:20,637
SAM: I rolled a 15. But it's minus two! But it's
still 13.

3089
03:29:20,637 --> 03:29:23,806
LAURA: Balls. Well, do I believe him?

3090
03:29:23,806 --> 03:29:26,104
TRAVIS: You do believe him. He doesn't know.

3091
03:29:26,104 --> 03:29:28,819
SAM: I don't know what happened with your bear.

3092
03:29:28,819 --> 03:29:31,811
TRAVIS: He seems quite flummoxed over Trinket's
sudden--

3093
03:29:31,811 --> 03:29:35,500
LAURA: It's just so weird that he got sick right
after you gave him food.

3094
03:29:35,500 --> 03:29:41,007
SAM: You know, I found that meat back there. Maybe
it was poison or something, but I wouldn't know

3095
03:29:41,007 --> 03:29:44,608
from poison, I'm a simple pauper.

3096
03:29:44,608 --> 03:29:52,328
LIAM: You know, I have never seen you feed a
single thing to that bear in all the time we've

3097
03:29:52,328 --> 03:29:53,591
known you.

3098
03:29:53,591 --> 03:29:57,585
TALIESIN: That is peculiar, isn't it? The
deception was against her, I think you have to

3099
03:29:57,585 --> 03:29:58,917
roll separately for us.

3100
03:29:58,917 --> 03:30:01,107
LIAM: What was your reasoning for feeding Trinket
right now?

3101
03:30:01,107 --> 03:30:03,403
SAM: Seemed hungry!

3102
03:30:03,403 --> 03:30:06,355
LIAM: He's always hungry, Scanman.

3103
03:30:06,355 --> 03:30:11,201
TRAVIS: You're interrupted by an explosion from
the top of the tower. A sound of noise.

3104
03:30:11,201 --> 03:30:19,136
(deep humming) A flash of light. Your attention is
directed to the top of the tower. What do you do?

3105
03:30:19,136 --> 03:30:21,763
LAURA: Is the electric field still up?

3106
03:30:21,763 --> 03:30:23,369
TRAVIS: It seems to have dissipated.

3107
03:30:23,369 --> 03:30:24,834
TALIESIN: I'm climbing up the tower.

3108
03:30:24,834 --> 03:30:27,458
LAURA: I fly up, put Trinket back in my necklace
and fly up.

3109
03:30:27,458 --> 03:30:29,948
TRAVIS: Fly up. Spider walk.

3110
03:30:29,948 --> 03:30:31,100
SAM: Climb.

3111
03:30:31,100 --> 03:30:35,008
TRAVIS: Climb. Athletics checks for Percy and
Scanlan.

3112
03:30:35,008 --> 03:30:38,210
SAM: First, I'm going to bonus Healing Word myself
again.

3113
03:30:38,210 --> 03:30:45,018
TALIESIN: A seven. I mean, it's just walking.

3114
03:30:45,018 --> 03:30:46,365
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3115
03:30:46,365 --> 03:30:48,266
SAM: Is this an acrobatics check?

3116
03:30:48,266 --> 03:30:49,371
TRAVIS: Athletics.

3117
03:30:49,371 --> 03:30:57,993
SAM: Athletics check. I will inspire myself. Ooh,
that's four plus three plus four.

3118
03:30:57,993 --> 03:31:07,636
TRAVIS: Four plus three plus four, that's good.
Great. As Percy is walking up the tower, he trips

3119
03:31:07,636 --> 03:31:13,688
and falls into the tower and smashes his face and
stands back up with his boots. You take eight

3120
03:31:13,688 --> 03:31:15,854
points of smash-your-face damage.

3121
03:31:15,854 --> 03:31:17,324
TALIESIN: I regret nothing.

3122
03:31:17,324 --> 03:31:23,643
TRAVIS: Scanlan, you fall after about 15 feet. You
take eight points of bludgeoning damage.

3123
03:31:23,643 --> 03:31:26,696
SAM: I've essentially undone my heal.

3124
03:31:26,696 --> 03:31:33,604
TRAVIS: You start climbing back up to the tower.
You all reach the top. It has a very similar--

3125
03:31:33,604 --> 03:31:49,234
just ignore that. Whatever. And there in the
middle is your friend, Grog. He's like, "Guys! I

3126
03:31:49,234 --> 03:31:55,169
"knew you would come and find me! I mean, one
second we were all in the tavern, and then all of

3127
03:31:55,169 --> 03:32:03,587
"a sudden it went hazy. You won't believe what I've
had to go through. There was a big hallway with a

3128
03:32:03,587 --> 03:32:05,644
"ghost, and then there were all these monsters."

3129
03:32:05,644 --> 03:32:06,685
SAM: Insight check.

3130
03:32:06,685 --> 03:32:08,221
TRAVIS: Roll an insight check.

3131
03:32:08,221 --> 03:32:10,217
LIAM: If it's a doppelganger, we have to murder
him together.

3132
03:32:10,217 --> 03:32:12,117
SAM: Nine.

3133
03:32:12,117 --> 03:32:16,219
LIAM: Insight check for sure. Oh, that's
terrible.

3134
03:32:16,219 --> 03:32:17,536
LAURA: I'm going to join in.

3135
03:32:17,536 --> 03:32:19,276
LIAM: Four.

3136
03:32:19,276 --> 03:32:20,439
TALIESIN: Six.

3137
03:32:20,439 --> 03:32:23,506
SAM: Four, six, nine, and--?

3138
03:32:23,506 --> 03:32:25,479
LIAM: Come on, girl!

3139
03:32:25,479 --> 03:32:26,939
LAURA: 15!

3140
03:32:26,939 --> 03:32:35,478
TRAVIS: You can tell that Grog is telling the
truth. "I had to walk through all these things and

3141
03:32:35,478 --> 03:32:41,829
"I came to this door and I saw a star and I
recognized the star on the door as the symbol of the

3142
03:32:41,829 --> 03:32:49,280
"Dallas Cowboys and I went in and I found a healing
potion and I had to go up. There was this thing up

3143
03:32:49,280 --> 03:32:54,212
"there and I had to kill it, and when I did there
was like a zoo I was in! There were all these

3144
03:32:54,212 --> 03:33:05,480
"other creatures and these partitions and I'm here.
I'm so glad-- did you teleport here, or Plane Shifty?"

3145
03:33:05,480 --> 03:33:09,464
SAM: We did the same thing what you did.

3146
03:33:09,464 --> 03:33:11,429
LAURA: Yeah, we were just a little behind you.

3147
03:33:11,429 --> 03:33:14,946
TRAVIS: "You didn't fight your way here, did you?
You didn't go through the rooms?"

3148
03:33:14,946 --> 03:33:17,153
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that whole thing.

3149
03:33:17,153 --> 03:33:18,540
SAM: Why?

3150
03:33:18,540 --> 03:33:25,198
TRAVIS: "I don't want to fight you." You hear a
voice echo from above you as you see a cloaked,

3151
03:33:25,198 --> 03:33:36,048
levitating figure take form. A female voice shouts
out, "I need a hero! I need a hero until the end

3152
03:33:36,048 --> 03:33:44,493
"of the night! He's got to be strong, he's got to
be fast, he's got to be fresh from the fight!" And

3153
03:33:44,493 --> 03:33:50,651
you see Trish the Dish floating above the
platform. Trish, the god of Whitestone, looking

3154
03:33:50,651 --> 03:33:53,876
down and saying, "I need one of you to be my
champion."

3155
03:33:53,876 --> 03:33:56,677
LAURA: That's how I pictured your mom singing it.

3156
03:33:56,677 --> 03:34:02,215
TRAVIS: It's pretty close. You should hear her in
church: awful. You see now as Grog shakes his

3157
03:34:02,215 --> 03:34:07,050
head, goes into a rage, and I need you all to roll
initiative.

3158
03:34:07,050 --> 03:34:09,206
SAM: Are we fighting each other or are we just
fighting you?

3159
03:34:09,206 --> 03:34:11,048
LAURA: We're just fighting Grog.

3160
03:34:11,048 --> 03:34:14,049
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

3161
03:34:14,049 --> 03:34:15,296
LIAM: Terrible.

3162
03:34:15,296 --> 03:34:17,321
TALIESIN: 28.

3163
03:34:17,321 --> 03:34:19,580
LAURA: 16.

3164
03:34:19,580 --> 03:34:27,895
LIAM: Stinkaroo. Seven. Rolled a two on the Matt
die.

3165
03:34:27,895 --> 03:34:29,382
SAM: Ten.

3166
03:34:29,382 --> 03:34:36,688
TRAVIS: You watch as Grog goes into a rage and you
see a hesitation. He doesn't want to attack his

3167
03:34:36,688 --> 03:34:44,846
friends. He looks down at his arm and you see
there similar scrapes, cuts, gashes as you saw on

3168
03:34:44,846 --> 03:34:55,940
the corpse below. He looks up, grins, and lets out
a ferocious howl as he transforms into werewolf

3169
03:34:55,940 --> 03:35:11,162
Grog! Destiny fulfilled! The time has come! He
charges forward. He races towards Percy and will

3170
03:35:11,162 --> 03:35:14,782
make a reckless Great Weapon Master attack.

3171
03:35:14,782 --> 03:35:19,425
LIAM: This is Grog porn if ever there was any.

3172
03:35:19,425 --> 03:35:20,667
LAURA: Yeah.

3173
03:35:20,667 --> 03:35:22,047
TRAVIS: 26.

3174
03:35:22,047 --> 03:35:23,640
TALIESIN: That hits.

3175
03:35:23,640 --> 03:35:32,251
TRAVIS: That is 27 points of damage.

3176
03:35:32,251 --> 03:35:36,716
LAURA: Oh man! I really should have healed up
more! Shit!

3177
03:35:36,716 --> 03:35:38,759
LIAM: Hit die! Too late.

3178
03:35:38,759 --> 03:35:41,805
TRAVIS: Minus five. 20.

3179
03:35:41,805 --> 03:35:43,114
TALIESIN: That hits.

3180
03:35:43,114 --> 03:35:56,319
TRAVIS: 24 points of damage. That will end Grog's
turn. Actually, he'll stay there because he's

3181
03:35:56,319 --> 03:35:59,314
within melee range. Next up: Percy.

3182
03:35:59,314 --> 03:36:15,903
TALIESIN: Let me do this. I'm still very
reasonable. Let's do a few things. We're right

3183
03:36:15,903 --> 03:36:23,904
next to each other. You get an attack of
opportunity if-- actually, I'm going to use the

3184
03:36:23,904 --> 03:36:35,825
Cinture of the Stone King to do a shockwave of
thunderous energy. I'm going to cast shockwave at

3185
03:36:35,825 --> 03:36:41,460
level five which is a DC 16.

3186
03:36:41,460 --> 03:36:44,169
TRAVIS: Is that dex?

3187
03:36:44,169 --> 03:36:48,205
TALIESIN: Thunderwave, let me find out.

3188
03:36:48,205 --> 03:37:08,500
TRAVIS: I'll look also. Thunderwave. Constitution
saving throw. Nope.

3189
03:37:08,500 --> 03:37:20,318
TALIESIN: All right, then. Failed save is 2d8
thunder damage and is pushed ten feet away. 2d8

3190
03:37:20,318 --> 03:37:32,130
plus five. I hope I'm doing this right. That's
6d8.

3191
03:37:32,130 --> 03:37:34,057
TRAVIS: Jesus.

3192
03:37:34,057 --> 03:37:41,107
TALIESIN: Boy, this is so much math. Hold on.
Sorry.

3193
03:37:41,107 --> 03:37:43,288
TRAVIS: I know, I hate the ones that have math.

3194
03:37:43,288 --> 03:37:52,901
TALIESIN: Two, four. Six. And one more.

3195
03:37:52,901 --> 03:37:57,066
LAURA: How crazy will it be to go back 
to just rolling one die?

3196
03:37:57,111 --> 03:37:59,751
LIAM: It's going to be the best. The best!

3197
03:37:59,751 --> 03:38:04,015
TALIESIN: 38 points of damage. And you're pushed
ten feet away.

3198
03:38:04,015 --> 03:38:05,717
LAURA: No!

3199
03:38:05,717 --> 03:38:07,823
LIAM: I strike for four hit points of damage.

3200
03:38:07,823 --> 03:38:10,005
TRAVIS: I'm already ten feet away, good.

3201
03:38:10,005 --> 03:38:16,022
TALIESIN: So there we are. The next thing that's
going to happen is I'm going to burn an action

3202
03:38:16,022 --> 03:38:21,395
surge and I'm going to shoot you several times.
First shot.

3203
03:38:21,395 --> 03:38:25,020
LAURA: Hey, Percy, leave some Grog for the rest of
us!

3204
03:38:25,020 --> 03:38:32,422
TALIESIN: Oh, I will. There'll be plenty. First
shot, I'm going to shoot you in the head.

3205
03:38:32,422 --> 03:38:36,113
TRAVIS: That's so casual! Okay!

3206
03:38:36,113 --> 03:38:48,923
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it. My gun jams and I
take five points of psychic damage. So that's

3207
03:38:48,923 --> 03:39:07,601
funny. My gun jams and I'm going to back off to
the right about 30 feet. For my bonus, I'm going

3208
03:39:07,601 --> 03:39:09,783
to heal a little bit and then that's the end of
me.

3209
03:39:09,783 --> 03:39:11,456
TRAVIS: Vex, you're up.

3210
03:39:11,456 --> 03:39:18,492
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to bamf Trinket out and run
up to Grog, but he's not going to attack him.

3211
03:39:18,492 --> 03:39:20,439
TRAVIS: Trinket's going to run up?

3212
03:39:20,439 --> 03:39:26,514
LAURA: Yeah, he's going to run up next to him. I'm
going to Hunter's Mark Grog. Then I'm going to

3213
03:39:26,514 --> 03:39:36,667
shoot him twice. Well, I'm going to shoot him
first, hold on, let's see if it hits. 22.

3214
03:39:36,667 --> 03:39:38,488
TRAVIS: 22 hits.

3215
03:39:38,488 --> 03:39:49,885
LAURA: That's a bramble shot. That's going to be
4d8 of piercing damage plus regular damage! Nine,

3216
03:39:49,885 --> 03:40:10,240
17, 19. Plus-- what was that? 19? 19 plus five is
24 plus eight is 32. Plus lightning. 36. Hunter's

3217
03:40:10,240 --> 03:40:27,895
Mark. 37. Plus sneak attack. 43. 46 damage on the
first arrow, and Grog has to make-- like this is

3218
03:40:27,895 --> 03:40:31,356
going to be really hard for him-- a strength
saving throw.

3219
03:40:31,356 --> 03:40:33,608
LIAM: Come on, one. One!

3220
03:40:33,608 --> 03:40:35,305
TRAVIS: 12.

3221
03:40:35,305 --> 03:40:37,236
LAURA: He's restrained.

3222
03:40:37,236 --> 03:40:45,112
TRAVIS: You notice as you do all this damage of
the physical variety, it's not doing as much

3223
03:40:45,112 --> 03:40:46,708
damage as you thought it might.

3224
03:40:46,708 --> 03:40:50,011
LAURA: Well, Grog is restrained.

3225
03:40:50,011 --> 03:40:52,846
TRAVIS: He's restrained. A raging werewolf.

3226
03:40:52,846 --> 03:40:58,990
LAURA: What does a werewolf take? Silver?

3227
03:40:58,990 --> 03:41:00,202
LIAM: Magic.

3228
03:41:00,202 --> 03:41:02,708
TRAVIS: And remember, Grog has all damage halved.

3229
03:41:02,708 --> 03:41:07,052
LAURA: Oh. Fucking hell! Okay. I'm going to shoot
him again while he's restrained.

3230
03:41:07,052 --> 03:41:08,721
TRAVIS: Sure. Advantage.

3231
03:41:08,721 --> 03:41:13,815
LIAM: Sneak attack damage. 
Did you already use it?

3232
03:41:13,815 --> 03:41:31,250
LAURA: I already used it. That definitely hits.
30-something. Ten, 12, 15. 15 for the second

3233
03:41:31,250 --> 03:41:34,541
arrow, and I fly up in the air.

3234
03:41:34,541 --> 03:41:37,905
TRAVIS: Kick up on the broom and fly up?

3235
03:41:37,905 --> 03:41:43,208
LAURA: Kick up on the broom and fly up in the air.
That high. Sure, why not?

3236
03:41:43,208 --> 03:41:47,211
TRAVIS: Nice job. Scanlan!

3237
03:41:47,211 --> 03:41:50,074
SAM: Scanlan? What do I do?

3238
03:41:50,074 --> 03:41:51,723
TRAVIS: How many hit points do you have?

3239
03:41:51,723 --> 03:42:02,742
SAM: I will bonus action heal myself again.
Consistently healing myself. Good. Yeah, sure.

3240
03:42:02,742 --> 03:42:08,573
All right, that's something. 
Are we trying to kill Grog?

3241
03:42:08,573 --> 03:42:11,456
LAURA: Maybe try to get him unconscious or
something.

3242
03:42:11,456 --> 03:42:14,413
LIAM: We've got to kill him to be sure.

3243
03:42:14,413 --> 03:42:21,077
SAM: All right. I will cast Bigby's Hand at
6th-level, and I will punch Grog.

3244
03:42:21,077 --> 03:42:24,472
TRAVIS: Bigby's Hand comes out. Crunch.

3245
03:42:24,472 --> 03:42:38,736
SAM: It's 10d6, and it just hits because you're
restrained, I think. It's d6s, right?

3246
03:42:38,736 --> 03:42:54,760
It's either 6d8 or 10d6. Let me look it up real fast. 
Bigby's Hand. (muttering)

3247
03:42:54,760 --> 03:42:57,441
Clenched fist. It's 6d8. I need d8.

3248
03:42:57,441 --> 03:43:00,960
TALIESIN: Here's 3d8.

3249
03:43:00,960 --> 03:43:13,587
SAM: All right. That's it. 6d8. That's what I did.
24.

3250
03:43:13,587 --> 03:43:15,345
TRAVIS: 24.

3251
03:43:15,345 --> 03:43:19,791
SAM: Yes. It doesn't automatically crit or
anything, right?

3252
03:43:19,791 --> 03:43:24,332
And then I will back away, slowly.

3253
03:43:24,332 --> 03:43:31,693
TRAVIS: As you hit Grog with Bigby's Hand, you see
the pain ripple through his body, and the wolf

3254
03:43:31,693 --> 03:43:42,027
form fades, painfully. You see his wounds are all
quite evident. He is already quite hurt from his

3255
03:43:42,027 --> 03:43:43,810
struggles up the tower.

3256
03:43:43,810 --> 03:43:46,506
SAM: Maybe speak to him in unicorn language.

3257
03:43:46,506 --> 03:43:48,065
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to try.

3258
03:43:48,065 --> 03:43:56,048
TRAVIS: He takes a knee and says, "I'm hideous.
I thought I really wanted to be like this,

3259
03:43:56,048 --> 03:44:03,879
"but I'm not sure it's all it's cracked up to be.
Percy, you have a silvered sword. End it."

3260
03:44:03,879 --> 03:44:08,441
LIAM: Shank him, Percy.

3261
03:44:08,441 --> 03:44:13,116
TRAVIS: "Wait, you're not really going to do it,
are you?! Fuck! I was kidding. Jesus! Oh my god!"

3262
03:44:13,116 --> 03:44:14,515
TALIESIN: I thought we had an arrangement.

3263
03:44:14,515 --> 03:44:18,677
TRAVIS: "We did, but I wanted to see 
if you'd go through with it! Hold on.

3264
03:44:18,677 --> 03:44:20,670
"Let me get my courage up."

3265
03:44:20,670 --> 03:44:24,115
TALIESIN: Oh my god, what is that behind you? 
I turn, and I run, and I attack him!

3266
03:44:24,115 --> 03:44:26,880
TRAVIS: Roll to attack.

3267
03:44:26,880 --> 03:44:31,681
TALIESIN: That's 26.

3268
03:44:31,681 --> 03:44:35,347
TRAVIS: 26 will hit. It doesn't matter.

3269
03:44:35,347 --> 03:44:37,967
TALIESIN: That's fine.

3270
03:44:37,967 --> 03:44:42,176
TRAVIS: The silvered sword sinks 
into Grog's chest. He goes,

3271
03:44:42,176 --> 03:44:47,741
"Thank you, you dark motherfucker." 
And Grog falls over.

3272
03:44:47,741 --> 03:44:56,878
You hear (laughs), as Trish the Dish, 
above in her robes, says,

3273
03:44:56,878 --> 03:45:08,125
"I see a champion has fallen. You four. Hmm.
Interesting. Another time, then."

3274
03:45:08,125 --> 03:45:12,623
And she evaporates from the air. 
You find yourselves instantly transported

3275
03:45:12,623 --> 03:45:18,391
back to the tavern, with Grog's bloodied body 
on the table, pouring everywhere,

3276
03:45:18,391 --> 03:45:27,426
and the poor old innkeeper going, "Oh my god! 
You're going to have to pay for that."

3277
03:45:27,426 --> 03:45:30,205
SAM: He dies, too?

3278
03:45:30,205 --> 03:45:31,618
TRAVIS: He dies.

3279
03:45:31,618 --> 03:45:33,713
TALIESIN: Quick, what was his son's name?

3280
03:45:33,713 --> 03:45:34,904
TRAVIS: Timothy.

3281
03:45:34,904 --> 03:45:36,115
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

3282
03:45:36,115 --> 03:45:37,708
SAM: Is Grog dead?

3283
03:45:37,708 --> 03:45:41,224
LAURA: Can I use my last Cure Wounds at 3rd-level
and heal him?

3284
03:45:41,224 --> 03:45:43,749
TALIESIN: There's a half-conscious Pike we could
wake up.

3285
03:45:43,749 --> 03:45:47,868
LAURA: Yeah, I'll heal him for now, and then Pike
will really heal him.

3286
03:45:47,868 --> 03:45:49,518
TRAVIS: What has the story taught you?

3287
03:45:49,518 --> 03:45:51,223
SAM: What has the story taught us?

3288
03:45:51,223 --> 03:45:54,020
TRAVIS: How much you care and need Grog.

3289
03:45:54,020 --> 03:45:55,361
LAURA: Yeah, obviously.

3290
03:45:55,361 --> 03:46:00,327
SAM: No, it actually taught us that in the end, 
we have to kill Grog.

3291
03:46:00,327 --> 03:46:01,968
TALIESIN: And we're willing to do it.

3292
03:46:01,968 --> 03:46:06,346
LIAM: And to get while the getting is good. And I
would like to shave the other side of Grog's face

3293
03:46:06,346 --> 03:46:08,008
that I didn't shave that one time.

3294
03:46:08,008 --> 03:46:14,460
TRAVIS: The mystic werewolf powers within him will
regrow, even in an unconscious state, any hair

3295
03:46:14,460 --> 03:46:15,811
that you shave.

3296
03:46:15,811 --> 03:46:19,116
LIAM: Shave, shave, shave. It keeps growing back!

3297
03:46:19,116 --> 03:46:21,964
TRAVIS: And the sun rises on yet another day.

3298
03:46:21,964 --> 03:46:29,223
SAM: Before the sun rises, I cast Wish that Trish
has persistent gonorrhea forever.

3299
03:46:29,223 --> 03:46:34,115
TRAVIS: Is there a DC save against persistent
gonorrhea?

3300
03:46:34,115 --> 03:46:36,167
SAM: I think I do have to roll something.

3301
03:46:36,167 --> 03:46:43,180
TRAVIS: You roll a d20 and I'll roll a d20. Ready?
One, two, three. Eight.

3302
03:46:43,180 --> 03:46:44,470
SAM: 17.

3303
03:46:44,470 --> 03:46:45,879
(laughter)

3304
03:46:45,879 --> 03:46:53,684
TRAVIS: Persistent. The rest of her cursed life.
And that will bring an end to our game.

3305
03:46:53,684 --> 03:46:55,278
TALIESIN: That's amazing!

3306
03:46:55,278 --> 03:47:03,779
SAM: Wow. Wait, because that was the end of
Bunions and Flagons. We're still in character.

3307
03:47:03,779 --> 03:47:06,742
LAURA: Oh, that game was so fun!

3308
03:47:06,742 --> 03:47:11,534
TRAVIS: It really was good, right? It's not as
good as the long-haired guy in the tavern

3309
03:47:11,534 --> 03:47:14,932
down the way. If you want to see 
a real chapter, you should see him.

3310
03:47:14,932 --> 03:47:18,459
LIAM: Did you happen to catch this man's name?

3311
03:47:18,459 --> 03:47:24,682
TRAVIS: No, I didn't. It was something like Bursar
or Cathew. I missed it.

3312
03:47:24,682 --> 03:47:26,551
SAM: Cathew Verser?

3313
03:47:26,551 --> 03:47:27,738
LIAM: Cathew Verser.

3314
03:47:27,738 --> 03:47:29,319
SAM: All right, we'll look out for him.

3315
03:47:29,319 --> 03:47:34,305
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's a champ. But think about what
you want to do differently next time that was--

3316
03:47:34,305 --> 03:47:36,384
LAURA: Questionable?

3317
03:47:36,384 --> 03:47:45,990
TRAVIS: From a strategic-- I'm a genius at
tactics. Percy, I like what you did.

3318
03:47:45,990 --> 03:47:48,074
Scanlan, nicely done.

3319
03:47:48,074 --> 03:47:52,379
SAM: I think bard gnomes are not that good. I
think next time I'm going to be a ranger.

3320
03:47:52,379 --> 03:47:56,741
LIAM: What a shitty combination. 
Can we do a sci-fi bent next time?

3321
03:47:56,741 --> 03:48:04,919
Rifts or Shadowrun or cyberpunk?

3322
03:48:04,919 --> 03:48:06,125
TRAVIS: A do-ron-ron?

3323
03:48:06,125 --> 03:48:07,145
LIAM: A do-ron-ron, yeah.

3324
03:48:07,145 --> 03:48:08,919
LAURA: Grog, that was great.

3325
03:48:08,919 --> 03:48:10,942
LIAM: It was very entertaining.

3326
03:48:10,942 --> 03:48:14,218
TRAVIS: I'm a little bit tired because that was 
a three and a half hour game,

3327
03:48:14,218 --> 03:48:16,089
right in that sweet spot.

3328
03:48:16,089 --> 03:48:18,347
LIAM: Who won the game, though, Grog?

3329
03:48:18,347 --> 03:48:20,282
TRAVIS: Who has the most XP?

3330
03:48:20,282 --> 03:48:21,797
TALIESIN: I have 150 XP.

3331
03:48:21,797 --> 03:48:22,985
LAURA: I have 200.

3332
03:48:22,985 --> 03:48:24,086
LIAM: Ten.

3333
03:48:24,086 --> 03:48:25,640
SAM: I have 300 XP.

3334
03:48:25,640 --> 03:48:32,506
TRAVIS: I have a bonus 500 XP to give, 
but you have to guess my favorite color.

3335
03:48:32,506 --> 03:48:34,015
LAURA: Red.

3336
03:48:34,015 --> 03:48:35,564
TALIESIN: Six.

3337
03:48:35,564 --> 03:48:36,881
LIAM: Titties.

3338
03:48:36,881 --> 03:48:37,883
SAM: Ale.

3339
03:48:37,883 --> 03:48:39,328
TRAVIS: Percy guessed it.

3340
03:48:39,328 --> 03:48:40,539
LIAM: Not titties?

3341
03:48:40,539 --> 03:48:42,148
TRAVIS: It's six.

3342
03:48:42,148 --> 03:48:43,702
LIAM: I don't know you anymore.

3343
03:48:43,702 --> 03:48:48,399
TALIESIN: I've always known you. 
That's why I will be the one to end you.

3344
03:48:48,399 --> 03:48:53,393
TRAVIS: It was so good, I had to give it to you.
I'm going to bed. Good night!

3345
03:48:53,393 --> 03:48:57,535
SAM: I call a servant over, and I say: 
Bring him some chicken.

3346
03:48:57,535 --> 03:49:01,888
TALIESIN: Soy chicken, but at least it's
something.

3347
03:49:01,888 --> 03:49:03,489
TRAVIS: And that's it!

3348
03:49:03,489 --> 03:49:05,667
(cheering)

3349
03:49:05,667 --> 03:49:07,001
TRAVIS: Done! Oh god.

3350
03:49:07,001 --> 03:49:09,994
TALIESIN: I missed Percy. That was really fun.

3351
03:49:09,994 --> 03:49:11,433
LAURA: That was really good.

3352
03:49:11,433 --> 03:49:16,169
TRAVIS: You find in the distance, the T-rex and
the unicorn find each other and start a new

3353
03:49:16,169 --> 03:49:17,632
magical hybrid race.

3354
03:49:17,632 --> 03:49:20,241
LIAM: That's the thumbnail image, right there.

3355
03:49:20,241 --> 03:49:23,423
TRAVIS: Well, that was awful.

3356
03:49:23,423 --> 03:49:26,279
TALIESIN: You did very well.

3357
03:49:26,279 --> 03:49:30,422
TRAVIS: That math is impossible, 
as well as keeping track of that shit.

3358
03:49:30,422 --> 03:49:32,988
TALIESIN: It's panic-inducing back there. 
It's a lot!

3359
03:49:32,988 --> 03:49:36,296
TRAVIS: I don't know how he keeps track 
of all that stuff.

3360
03:49:36,296 --> 03:49:39,522
TALIESIN: Do you have anything taped 
to the screen?

3361
03:49:39,522 --> 03:49:40,662
TRAVIS: It's a mess.

3362
03:49:40,662 --> 03:49:42,749
LAURA: How do you plan the next move 
that you're going to do when every turn

3363
03:49:42,749 --> 03:49:44,081
is your turn, as well?

3364
03:49:44,081 --> 03:49:47,780
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's a big struggle.

3365
03:49:47,780 --> 03:49:49,627
LAURA: "Stroogle?" It is a "stroogle."

3366
03:49:49,627 --> 03:49:51,877
TRAVIS: It is a "stroogle." I suffer from 
the same problem Sam had.

3367
03:49:51,877 --> 03:49:53,940
I think I had a bit too many enemies.

3368
03:49:53,940 --> 03:49:56,087
SAM: You had the perfect amount!

3369
03:49:56,087 --> 03:49:57,204
TRAVIS: Okay, good.

3370
03:49:57,204 --> 03:49:58,801
TALIESIN: It felt good from this end.

3371
03:49:58,801 --> 03:50:02,963
TRAVIS: Well, for those that stayed with us, thank
you. That would be my first and probably only

3372
03:50:02,963 --> 03:50:10,045
foray into being a BM master. We would like to
thank our sponsor for tonight's episode:

3373
03:50:10,045 --> 03:50:11,608
Marvel Puzzle Quest.

3374
03:50:11,608 --> 03:50:17,943
SAM: Go to bit.ly/marvelcrit, and make sure that
they know that you came from Critical Role.

3375
03:50:17,943 --> 03:50:23,838
TRAVIS: Yeah. Thor: Ragnarok comes out this
weekend, and we hope you all enjoy it very much.

3376
03:50:23,838 --> 03:50:31,787
Laura and I will be gone, but next week is
Marisha's Honey Heist, and there will be

3377
03:50:31,787 --> 03:50:36,239
a Talks Machina on Tuesday, apparently. 
I won't be here to talk about it,

3378
03:50:36,239 --> 03:50:39,461
but I'm sure you'll say lovely things.

3379
03:50:39,461 --> 03:50:40,930
LIAM: We will say lovely things.

3380
03:50:40,930 --> 03:50:42,132
TRAVIS: I will watch from Australia.

3381
03:50:42,132 --> 03:50:43,219
LAURA: And also, we have scarves!

3382
03:50:43,219 --> 03:50:46,698
LIAM: The scarves are the fucking bomb. They're so
soft and cozy.

3383
03:50:46,698 --> 03:50:49,169
SAM: They're not those one-sided scarves.

3384
03:50:49,169 --> 03:50:51,436
LAURA: Dual-sided scarves!

3385
03:50:51,436 --> 03:50:56,411
LIAM: Hey, good job with those three of my 400
miniatures, Travis.

3386
03:50:56,411 --> 03:51:00,587
TRAVIS: Hey, man. Thanks. Your miniature
collection is to be applauded. I looked at it,

3387
03:51:00,587 --> 03:51:02,560
and I couldn't see the forest--

3388
03:51:02,560 --> 03:51:05,485
LIAM: How lucky are my eight- and 11-year-old?

3389
03:51:05,485 --> 03:51:06,771
TRAVIS: So lucky.

3390
03:51:06,771 --> 03:51:07,942
LIAM: Yeah.

3391
03:51:07,942 --> 03:51:09,736
LAURA: Love you, baby.

3392
03:51:09,736 --> 03:51:15,815
TRAVIS: Love you. Thank you, guys, and what's the
old signoff? Is it Thursday yet?

3393
03:51:15,815 --> 03:51:19,383
SAM: That was the worst delivery of that line.

3394
03:51:19,432 --> 03:51:21,350
TRAVIS: Good night.

3395
03:51:21,350 --> 03:57:43,761
