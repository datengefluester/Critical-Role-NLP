1
00:00:00,165 --> 00:00:03,887
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,887 --> 00:00:08,924
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around, roll dice, and
play Dungeons and Dragons. Yes, in my face.

3
00:00:08,924 --> 00:00:17,931
Thanks, Travis. So tonight we'll kick off here
with some announcements. First and foremost, the

4
00:00:17,931 --> 00:00:24,092
first run with Loot Crate went very well; you guys
rose up and showed your interest in that fantastic

5
00:00:24,092 --> 00:00:25,554
product and they've come back!

6
00:00:25,554 --> 00:00:28,482
(cheering)

7
00:00:28,482 --> 00:00:30,258
TRAVIS: Put the stank down! Loot Crate!

8
00:00:30,258 --> 00:00:31,441
MATT: Once again--

9
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:32,854
SAM: (airhorn sounds)

10
00:00:32,854 --> 00:00:35,105
(laughter)

11
00:00:35,105 --> 00:00:43,901
MATT: That's wonderful. So yeah, so those of you
guys who are tuning into this wonderful offer for

12
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:51,553
the first time, they are offering a $3
subscription-- the word escapes me for some

13
00:00:51,553 --> 00:00:52,317
reason.

14
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:53,441
SAM: Discount.

15
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:55,576
MATT: Discount, that's the word, because my brain
is stuck in fantasy mode.

16
00:00:55,576 --> 00:00:57,909
MARISHA: Discount code. I love that you called it
a modifier!

17
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:00,474
MATT: He said "modifier." That was Travis on that
one.

18
00:01:00,474 --> 00:01:02,578
TRAVIS: Jock said modifier, y'all.

19
00:01:02,578 --> 00:01:09,438
MATT: Minus $3 modifier to your Critical Role
subscription for Loot Crate. But no, Loot Crate is

20
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:14,638
a monthly subscription box. They make a really
awesome, continuously new array of geek-centric

21
00:01:14,638 --> 00:01:21,878
and gamer gear, toys, T-shirts, wearable content,
collectibles, it's badass. Me and Marisha have

22
00:01:21,878 --> 00:01:23,470
been members for years ourselves.

23
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:24,789
MARISHA: And Taliesin.

24
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:28,860
High-five. There we go.

25
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,459
TALIESIN: High-five. That was so awkward.

26
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:35,427
MATT: That was delightfully awkward. That was
great. So we announced at the end of the last run

27
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:39,591
with Loot Crate that their new upcoming box is
themed "dystopia." It's everything

28
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:48,072
post-apocalyptic, they've had a lot of really
awesome Robocop, Terminator 3, Matrix items and

29
00:01:48,072 --> 00:01:49,285
Bioshock items--

30
00:01:49,285 --> 00:01:50,337
LAURA: Fallout 4!

31
00:01:50,337 --> 00:01:56,554
MATT: --a bunch of really cool things in this
next Crate. Plus, on top of the previous stuff

32
00:01:56,554 --> 00:02:03,118
we've offered, they also put out what's called a
DX Box, this Dystopia DX. Which is a special,

33
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:09,647
premium box which contains over $100 in items into
it, it's for the really hardcore awesome

34
00:02:09,647 --> 00:02:12,528
collectors out there. And the box itself is a lot
bigger--

35
00:02:12,528 --> 00:02:13,934
TRAVIS: Yeah! Look at that thing!

36
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:16,792
SAM: It stands for "Damn! Extreme!"

37
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:19,733
(laughing)

38
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:21,838
SAM: Are we unboxing? Are we doing this?

39
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:24,229
TRAVIS: Don't let him get ahead of us! Open that
thing!

40
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:26,379
SAM: Are we just doing the DX?

41
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,954
LAURA: Shut up! I gotta savor this.

42
00:02:27,954 --> 00:02:30,615
LIAM: Skeletor! Mine!

43
00:02:30,615 --> 00:02:32,510
LAURA: No. no, It said small, it said small,
Liam!

44
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,853
LIAM: Skeletor. Mine!

45
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:37,925
MARISHA: Oh! Is it Skeletor?! Oh, this one's a
small too, on this side.

46
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:42,019
LAURA: Oh man. I guess the girls get to take
advantage of the Skeletor shirts.

47
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:44,936
MATT: (Skeletor voice) I'll get you He-Man!
(cackles)

48
00:02:44,936 --> 00:02:46,805
ASHLEY: Whoa! That's a rad shirt!

49
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:48,400
MARISHA: This is a rad shirt.

50
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,617
TALIESIN: There's Street Fighter, Street Fighter
gym bag.

51
00:02:51,617 --> 00:02:57,354
LAURA: Do you want to roshambo to see who keeps
the shirt?

52
00:02:57,354 --> 00:03:02,287
MATT: Having had the pleasure of actually playing
Captain America once, this is really awesome, and

53
00:03:02,287 --> 00:03:07,947
having voiced Iron Man once, this box is made for
me. Now I need to voice Skeletor and I'll be good.

54
00:03:07,947 --> 00:03:09,495
TRAVIS: There you go.

55
00:03:09,495 --> 00:03:10,976
MATT: That's fantastic.

56
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:17,663
SAM: Oh, I'm wearing a Loot Crate shirt right now.
No, from this month's Loot Crate--

57
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:28,508
TALIESIN: I got my Street Fighter gym bag.

58
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,257
LAURA: That's so cool!

59
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:33,117
SAM: Are we allowed to open the small one, too?

60
00:03:33,117 --> 00:03:34,676
MATT: Heck yeah! Do it!

61
00:03:34,676 --> 00:03:37,494
SAM: I mean, it's not small. It's more exclusive.

62
00:03:37,494 --> 00:03:38,761
MATT: There you go.

63
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:43,925
LAURA: Did anybody-- who all did voices for Street
Fighter? Taliesin did-- You do Street Fighter,

64
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:44,927
don't you?

65
00:03:44,927 --> 00:03:46,861
TALIESIN: I do, I got my Street Fighter bag.

66
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:48,774
LAURA: So me and Travis will share this one?

67
00:03:48,774 --> 00:03:50,037
MATT: There you go.

68
00:03:50,037 --> 00:03:52,736
SAM: Here, Marish. What do we got?

69
00:03:52,736 --> 00:03:57,385
MARISHA: This is Dragonball, right?

70
00:03:57,385 --> 00:03:58,730
MATT: Yeah, that's Dragonball too.

71
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,267
MARISHA: Dragonball!

72
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:05,938
SAM: I mean, it's too much good stuff.

73
00:04:05,938 --> 00:04:12,220
MATT: That you are re-rolling a new character,
Grog suffered a stroke.

74
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,887
TRAVIS: Man, you're good.

75
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:20,111
MATT: I'm pretty fast on that draw. Pretty quick!
Watch out for the microphone. I found in here

76
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:27,405
hidden amongst the rest of the big things a really
awesome Stan Lee pin, which is badass

77
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:32,506
because years ago, at an Avengers-themed birthday
party, we all dressed up, I actually dressed up as

78
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,132
Stan Lee, it was a lot of fun--

79
00:04:34,132 --> 00:04:35,382
MARISHA: You did.

80
00:04:35,382 --> 00:04:41,014
MATT: Yeah. We got a whole Avengers Last Supper
picture with Stan Lee in the middle just going like--

81
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,253
LAURA: What?

82
00:04:42,253 --> 00:04:45,011
TALIESIN: It was also-- we had a friend who did
Jack Kirby and we got a fight sequence going.

83
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:51,657
MATT: Yeah, me and him fought. You showed up as the
Purple Man and you did karaoke to Start Wearing

84
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:53,651
Purple. That was a good night.

85
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:55,838
SAM: Stan Lee licks every pin.

86
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:59,806
MATT: He does. Individually. True believers!
(slurp noise)

87
00:04:59,806 --> 00:05:01,517
TALIESIN: Excelsior!

88
00:05:01,517 --> 00:05:06,627
MATT: So yeah, for those who aren't subscribers,
it's awesome.

89
00:05:06,627 --> 00:05:09,256
TRAVIS: That's a gift, man, that is a great gift.

90
00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:14,075
SAM: And with a $3 discount, if you multiply that
by 12, that's like getting a free Crate every

91
00:05:14,075 --> 00:05:15,984
year. I'm just making that up.

92
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:18,573
TRAVIS: I'm not good at math so I believe you.

93
00:05:18,573 --> 00:05:23,003
MARISHA: Yeah, I know, I was like, sounds legit.
Sure. I'd believe that!

94
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:29,222
MATT: So, if you want to sign up to get the
discount, you go to

95
00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:33,769
www.lootcrate.com/criticalrole. if you want to
sign up for the DX box, for the real collectors

96
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:41,157
out there, that is 
www.lootcrate.com/criticalroledx.

97
00:05:41,157 --> 00:05:43,555
LAURA: Is there a link in the chat or something,
so that--

98
00:05:43,555 --> 00:05:45,136
MATT: There is a link in the chat.

99
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,622
SAM: We'll also tweet one out or something.

100
00:05:46,622 --> 00:05:48,271
LAURA: Yeah, we'll tweet at the break.

101
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:56,043
MATT: Okay, so I'm going to keep this. And you're
not going to tell anyone.

102
00:05:56,043 --> 00:05:59,620
LAURA: (laughs) Are we supposed to give it back?
'Cause that's not happening.

103
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,954
MARISHA: Well, they might belong to Geek and
Sundry, but.

104
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:15,481
MATT: You guys won't tell anyone, right? Anyway,
on to the rest of the announcements! Next up, at

105
00:06:15,481 --> 00:06:23,306
E3, which is next week, we're going to be showing
up on Thursday as part of GameSpot's E3 coverage.

106
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:27,354
We're going to be doing cycling interviews with
them starting at noon on Thursday, I believe, next

107
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:32,503
week. So check in with GameSpot Thursday next week
to have us sit in front of a camera and make

108
00:06:32,503 --> 00:06:39,225
complete and utter fools of ourselves, unlike we
do here every Thursday. So that'll be a lot of

109
00:06:39,225 --> 00:06:46,134
fun. A reminder, me and Marisha are going to be at
the Haven Expo convention in Australia beginning

110
00:06:46,134 --> 00:06:50,559
of July, so all you Australian folks in the
Southern Hemisphere want to come and say hi, we'd

111
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:54,674
love to see you. Comic Con, San Diego Comic Con is
coming up.

112
00:06:54,674 --> 00:06:56,421
LIAM: I've heard of that.

113
00:06:56,421 --> 00:07:00,873
MATT: Yeah, yeah. We're going to be there. Looks
like we may have a couple panels

114
00:07:00,873 --> 00:07:04,991
throughout the week, as well as the main Geek and
Sundry panel, so if you guys are planning on

115
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:09,774
coming to that area, keep an eye on the
@CriticalRole Twitter, we're going to be

116
00:07:09,774 --> 00:07:14,791
announcing those times and rooms when they become
available to us, so you can plan to come see us

117
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,380
because we'd love to see you out there.

118
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,309
MARISHA: It's going to be all of us?

119
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:21,459
LAURA: Come say hi! As Travis says, "Come give us
a squeeze."

120
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:24,568
TRAVIS: Come give us a squeeze. We'll be at the
convention hall and we'll be over at Petco in both

121
00:07:24,568 --> 00:07:25,999
places at different times.

122
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:28,635
ASHLEY: Don't give me a squeeze, it makes me
uncomfortable.

123
00:07:28,635 --> 00:07:30,127
TRAVIS: It makes me toot.

124
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:32,536
ASHLEY: I don't like being touched.

125
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:37,841
TRAVIS: (fart sound) That'd be great every time.
(fart sound) Oh no.

126
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:40,316
ASHLEY: Oh no. I just fart every time.

127
00:07:40,316 --> 00:07:47,237
MATT: That's impressive, how does that keep
happening? All right, Taliesin, your next episode

128
00:07:47,237 --> 00:07:49,925
of Signal Boost, I believe your last episode of
Signal Boost--

129
00:07:49,925 --> 00:07:51,567
TALIESIN: It's my last episode of Signal Boost?

130
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:54,404
TRAVIS: But you're the most interesting man in the
world!

131
00:07:54,404 --> 00:07:56,106
LAURA: You really are, Taliesin.

132
00:07:56,106 --> 00:08:00,800
MARISHA: No one wants you to leave, but you're
leaving.

133
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,491
TALIESIN: It's really hard to make those episodes
and I have to get on with my life.

134
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:07,101
LIAM: Here's a cardboard box, please put all your
things in it.

135
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:09,872
MARISHA: And I have to get on with my life, is
that what you just said? It's hard to think about

136
00:08:09,872 --> 00:08:14,506
12 things that you legitimately feel passionately
about.

137
00:08:14,506 --> 00:08:18,313
TALIESIN: Especially when you took four of them on
your run. I was really angry about that.

138
00:08:18,313 --> 00:08:19,783
MARISHA: Oh, dibsies.

139
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:26,466
MATT: And we have the "Dear Abby" Vox Machina
articles still coming up-- we have a new one

140
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:30,023
tomorrow, I believe? Who's up on that one? Do we
know?

141
00:08:30,023 --> 00:08:32,387
SAM: It's Trinket and it's all salmon-based
advice.

142
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,483
(laughter)

143
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:36,144
MATT: If only that was the case.

144
00:08:36,144 --> 00:08:37,599
TALIESIN: It might be me?

145
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,717
MATT: It might be Percy, we'll find out! Tomorrow
it'll be a surprise! Go to geekandsundry.com

146
00:08:42,717 --> 00:08:49,783
tomorrow to find out whose article it is. Because
we don't know! And I think that's it, that's all,

147
00:08:49,783 --> 00:08:53,048
unless anyone has anything else they want to
announce, or shall we dive into the game for the

148
00:08:53,048 --> 00:08:54,106
evening?

149
00:08:54,106 --> 00:08:57,353
TRAVIS: I would like to announce that I have an
egg on my pizza.

150
00:08:57,353 --> 00:08:59,530
MATT: Was that intentional? Or did it just
happen?

151
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,852
LAURA: It's breakfast pizza, man!

152
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:02,579
TRAVIS: It's just a mythical thing, you don't
question it.

153
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:05,897
MATT: I love me some breakfast pizza! I didn't
know if it was actually breakfast pizza, or he got

154
00:09:05,897 --> 00:09:08,375
regular pizza and somehow it got an egg on it.

155
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,270
MARISHA: It's like slapstick pizza.

156
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,912
TALIESIN: It's very embarrassed pizza.

157
00:09:11,912 --> 00:09:17,314
MATT: Hmm, that's weird. Anyway, let's go ahead
and bring it down here, as we return to the realm

158
00:09:17,314 --> 00:09:23,240
of Exandria for tonight's episode of Critical
Role.

159
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,663
SAM: Is something happening now?

160
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:26,345
MATT: I hope so, I hope we're at the intro.

161
00:09:26,345 --> 00:10:56,090
[dramatic music]

162
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:01,917
MATT: Hello, and welcome back, everyone. So, to
bring us into tonight's game, let's do a little

163
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:07,785
recap of recent events. This group of intrepid
adventurers, Vox Machina, found their way towards

164
00:11:07,785 --> 00:11:12,750
the city of Westruun, which had been partially
destroyed by the attacks of the Chroma Conclave, a

165
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,539
dangerous group of chromatic dragons, very
powerful entities that tore through the

166
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:21,946
countryside. In the wake of this destruction, the
Herd of Storms, a roving barbaric tribe that Grog

167
00:11:21,946 --> 00:11:28,071
once belonged to, swept in and conquered the city
of Westruun. They made an accord with the

168
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:32,888
returning black dragon, Umbrasyl, that they would
alleviate most of the spoils of their findings

169
00:11:32,888 --> 00:11:37,567
toward it and, as such, would not be in conflict
with such a powerful and dangerous entity. Vox

170
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:47,015
Machina swung into the town, cut down the rather
brutal and ruthless leader, Kevdak, and aided his

171
00:11:47,015 --> 00:11:53,888
son, who seemed to be of more honorable mind,
Zanror, and Grog himself, to temporarily take the

172
00:11:53,888 --> 00:11:59,387
herd in its current state and use this moment to
surprise and hopefully take down this ancient

173
00:11:59,387 --> 00:12:04,720
black dragon known as Umbrasyl, the Hope
Devourer. They set a trap. They sprung it, and

174
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,716
kept the dragon close to the ground as long as
they could, dealing vast amounts of damage but not

175
00:12:08,716 --> 00:12:15,661
enough to stop it as it began to tear through the
herd, as well as Vox Machina itself. Vax and

176
00:12:15,661 --> 00:12:20,918
Scanlan had, through the use of magic and
ingenuity, teleported themselves inside of the

177
00:12:20,918 --> 00:12:25,007
dragon. Didn't seem to go as well as they
intended, as the dragon took off, leaving a

178
00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:30,506
dangling Grog with his axe and chain stuck in its
side, flying off towards the high, darkened

179
00:12:30,506 --> 00:12:36,010
mountain of Gatshadow. The midair battle ensued as
they tried to find ways to carve their way out of

180
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:43,512
the beast. Vax, utilising the embedded arrow hole
and loosening the tension of the muscles with the

181
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:51,088
dragon blade at his disposal, Scanlan's technique
a little more sensual.

182
00:12:51,088 --> 00:12:53,533
SAM: I fisted it.

183
00:12:53,533 --> 00:13:00,048
MATT: You fisted the dragon and, as such, found
your way out. During this period of time, Vax

184
00:13:00,048 --> 00:13:06,027
embraced the blessing of the Raven Queen, taking a
level of paladin, Grog got more intelligent,

185
00:13:06,027 --> 00:13:11,978
briefly, as a giant eagle, and you managed to
reconvene with your party members as the dragon

186
00:13:11,978 --> 00:13:19,415
went to recover within its lair at the top of
Gatshadow. You then encountered a very elderly

187
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:24,329
goliath who you hadn't seen in quite some time,
named Shale, who spoke of the scouting crew that

188
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:29,143
had been obliterated by the dragon. You followed
Shale as she led you up the mountain to where the

189
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:35,197
dragon's current lair resides. You did battle with
Umbrasyl, a very hard-fought battle, many of you

190
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:45,847
taking a bunch of damage. But you prevailed and
Grog dealt the death blow, killing the dragon. You

191
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:51,283
all began to sift through its hoard, the bulk of
which we will be doing as you rest into the

192
00:13:51,283 --> 00:13:56,513
evening here, Shale shambling down the mountain on
her own to see the rest of her greater destiny.

193
00:13:56,513 --> 00:14:02,342
So, as we come back, you've all decided to take an
evening's rest to recover from this heinous battle

194
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:09,466
that you just suffered. You carved out some
elements of Umbrasyl's corpse that were not

195
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:16,784
destroyed by the anger and might of Grog. I
believe I told you a tooth count, a blood vial

196
00:14:16,784 --> 00:14:20,240
count, what did I not give you from the remains of
the black dragon?

197
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,140
SAM: We don't know what we don't know, Matt.

198
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,535
TRAVIS: Scales and claws.

199
00:14:23,535 --> 00:14:26,086
MARISHA: I don't know if I got a tooth count,
either.

200
00:14:26,086 --> 00:14:29,227
LAURA: Oh, you got three vials of Umbrasyl
blood, is all we have.

201
00:14:29,227 --> 00:14:33,415
TALIESIN: It was a lot of teeth.

202
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:38,292
MATT: Yeah, it was 15 or so, I believe, because a
lot of them were destroyed from the perpetual axe

203
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:39,751
smashing in the mouth--

204
00:14:39,751 --> 00:14:41,291
LAURA: Do you want me to write them in the bag?

205
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,504
TRAVIS: Make sure it was dead!

206
00:14:42,504 --> 00:14:44,770
MATT: Yeah, exactly, it was the more
important part, really.

207
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,293
LAURA: I'm writing the body parts in the Bag of
Colding.

208
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:50,077
TALIESIN: What's a dragon kidney stone worth?

209
00:14:50,077 --> 00:14:52,325
LAURA: 15 teeth--

210
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,589
MARISHA: Does it turn into a pearl?

211
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:56,809
TALIESIN: It might do, you know, a diamond?

212
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:58,208
LAURA: What about scales?

213
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:06,996
MATT: Well, ten dragon claws were harvested from
this entity, and about-- and it's going to take you

214
00:15:06,996 --> 00:15:11,004
quite a while, you're probably not going to be
able to rest if you continue to harvest from the

215
00:15:11,004 --> 00:15:15,655
corpse to get scales off of it, at this
point, because it's more dragonhide than just

216
00:15:15,655 --> 00:15:20,478
scales, you're taking the hide off of it and
you're going to need a team of people and an

217
00:15:20,478 --> 00:15:22,913
extended period of time to do that well.

218
00:15:22,913 --> 00:15:25,951
TALIESIN: I said I was going to help with the
sword, with that process, since I've got it--

219
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,966
MATT: Okay, that does help, it's still going to
be-- there's a lot of hide--

220
00:15:28,966 --> 00:15:32,353
TRAVIS: We only have like 60 pounds of scales from
previously, left over.

221
00:15:32,353 --> 00:15:33,711
(thumps)

222
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:34,865
LAURA: What is happening?

223
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:36,146
TRAVIS: Umbrasyl's ghost.

224
00:15:36,146 --> 00:15:38,167
MATT: Yeah, ravaging the countryside from the
east.

225
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:39,334
SAM: We're still in the lair?

226
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:40,643
MATT: You are still in the lair, yes.

227
00:15:40,643 --> 00:15:41,989
MARISHA: We have 60 pounds of scales left?

228
00:15:41,989 --> 00:15:47,788
LAURA: Yeah, but these would be Umbrasyl scales.
This way we can make Umbrasyl black dragon armor!

229
00:15:47,788 --> 00:15:49,586
TRAVIS: Then we can have, yeah, black and white
scales.

230
00:15:49,586 --> 00:15:54,583
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but we could make
dragonhide-- with dragonhide you could make badass

231
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,653
armor, right?

232
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:57,756
LIAM: Yeah, we could have done that ages ago.

233
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,632
MARISHA: (laughs) I want some black and white
armor. How--

234
00:16:00,632 --> 00:16:04,092
MATT: Do keep in mind, the Bag of Holding can hold
upwards 500 pounds, to the max.

235
00:16:04,092 --> 00:16:05,152
LAURA: Oh.

236
00:16:05,152 --> 00:16:06,525
MATT: Just be aware.

237
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:07,590
SAM: It's not infinite?

238
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,510
MATT: No.

239
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,878
LAURA: Oh, I thought it was infinite.

240
00:16:09,878 --> 00:16:13,419
LIAM: Also, many of the shops that can do that
kind of thing are destroyed, so--

241
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:15,771
TRAVIS: Oh, we're okay, there's not a bunch of big
stuff in here.

242
00:16:15,771 --> 00:16:17,470
TALIESIN: We'll get some, we should get some.

243
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,788
SAM: What about the gold? Did we find out how much
gold?

244
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:21,227
MATT: We're about to find out.

245
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:25,247
LAURA: Well, okay, I'm definitely doing that while
they're working on the dragon.

246
00:16:25,247 --> 00:16:26,372
TALIESIN: We'll work on the scales.

247
00:16:26,372 --> 00:16:27,455
MATT: As you guys are working on the scales--

248
00:16:27,455 --> 00:16:30,154
MARISHA: I want to work most of-- I want to take as
much as I can--

249
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:35,861
MATT: Of the scales? Okay, that's fine. Hide,
dragonhide, we'll say. Scales themselves are just

250
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:40,509
little pieces, used more for alchemical elements,
can be removed from hide later, so we'll call it

251
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:44,269
hide. So I want you to go ahead and make an
investigation check, Laura.

252
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:48,517
LAURA: Oh man! Come on 20!

253
00:16:48,517 --> 00:16:50,930
LIAM: Also, I believe I was first to the pile. I
was looking for what weapons there are and I also

254
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,572
want to watch her, very closely, with everything
she does.

255
00:16:54,572 --> 00:16:57,338
LAURA: Does this have to do with dragons? Is it an
investigation about dragons?

256
00:16:57,338 --> 00:17:00,415
MATT: Uh, no, this is more to do with the gold--

257
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:05,124
LAURA: What about because I'm in a mountain and
it's my favored terrain?

258
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:09,648
MATT: Your favored terrain, ironically, is not
gold, it is mountains. However, when you level up

259
00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:15,338
as a ranger, if you choose to, your next favored
terrain should be gold. Just as a character choice--

260
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:19,833
LAURA: I'm just checking for-- I wanna be sure I'm
rolling what I'm supposed to--

261
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,945
LIAM: (singing) Ducktales! Woo-ooo!

262
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:24,276
LAURA: 13 is all that I rolled, though.

263
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:28,522
LIAM: With a swimming speed of 40 in gold.

264
00:17:28,522 --> 00:17:34,864
MATT: It is quite a lot of gold. As you start
counting up a section of it, and you being a very,

265
00:17:34,864 --> 00:17:40,312
very discerning eye, you're looking upwards of
around 78,000 gold pieces.

266
00:17:40,312 --> 00:17:41,968
LAURA: Oh, but some of this is Westruun's.

267
00:17:41,968 --> 00:17:43,612
MATT: A lot of this is Westruun's.

268
00:17:43,612 --> 00:17:44,799
ASHLEY: Is it, though?

269
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:52,511
LAURA: It is, it is, it is. You know what, I'm
going to keep it-- I'm keeping it in a separate

270
00:17:52,511 --> 00:17:55,736
stock, because I don't want to take money away
from Westruun--

271
00:17:55,736 --> 00:18:02,723
MATT: Just so you're aware, that's 1,570 pounds of
gold. You can't carry all that.

272
00:18:02,723 --> 00:18:04,659
ASHLEY: If we separated it?

273
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:07,896
LAURA: Well, we're going to put a marker in it and
let Westruun know that this is their gold and then

274
00:18:07,896 --> 00:18:09,238
we'll send them up--

275
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:11,241
TRAVIS: Oh that's fair! Then they can come back up
and get it.

276
00:18:11,241 --> 00:18:16,908
LAURA: Yeah, they can, 'cause how else are we
going to get it to them? I'm just going to take a

277
00:18:16,908 --> 00:18:18,022
little bit of it.

278
00:18:18,022 --> 00:18:19,749
MATT: How much you taking?

279
00:18:19,749 --> 00:18:21,326
SAM: 20%.

280
00:18:21,326 --> 00:18:22,574
TRAVIS: 15,000.

281
00:18:22,574 --> 00:18:25,932
LAURA: What we put in is still down on the
ground.

282
00:18:25,932 --> 00:18:29,104
MARISHA: How much did we put in?

283
00:18:29,104 --> 00:18:31,504
LIAM: Ten.

284
00:18:31,504 --> 00:18:35,272
LAURA: I think we should take 10,000.

285
00:18:35,272 --> 00:18:36,794
TRAVIS: Higher! Higher!

286
00:18:36,794 --> 00:18:38,314
LAURA: But it's Westruun's money!

287
00:18:38,314 --> 00:18:40,245
ASHLEY: We can let the people decide?

288
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:43,885
SAM: And we have spent a lot of our hard-earned
cash saving this for them.

289
00:18:43,885 --> 00:18:48,215
TALIESIN: I'm going to need a little bit of that
money to fix my gun, too, which is very broken.

290
00:18:48,215 --> 00:18:49,370
LAURA: How much do you need, Percy?

291
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,899
TALIESIN: I don't know how broken it is.

292
00:18:50,899 --> 00:18:53,804
SAM: Our Heroes' Feasts are 1,000 bucks each--

293
00:18:53,804 --> 00:18:59,092
MARISHA: About how much is 500 pounds worth of
gold? Maybe that's a better question?

294
00:18:59,092 --> 00:19:05,903
MATT: Well 50 gold pieces is one pound, so that's
about 100 pounds. 5,000 you said? 500? 500 would

295
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:09,902
be, you know, ten pounds.

296
00:19:09,902 --> 00:19:11,948
TALIESIN: We need some platinum.

297
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:15,904
LAURA: Oh, is there platinum in there? We're so
greedy!

298
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:21,199
MATT: It's mostly gold. Platinum is not too
heavily traded, it's usually more-- there aren't a

299
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:27,879
lot of people in the general town and cityscapes
of Westruun, these areas of the country, that

300
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:35,090
carry large volumes of platinum. They're more like
inter-country large purchases that are made. Most

301
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:42,454
of this has just been gathered from people's
homes, from personal stashes and mercantile store

302
00:19:42,454 --> 00:19:44,919
houses, so most of it here is gold.

303
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:47,134
MARISHA: How much did you say was the total
again?

304
00:19:47,134 --> 00:19:48,668
MATT: About 78,000.

305
00:19:48,668 --> 00:19:50,330
SAM: I feel like we should take 15 to 20.

306
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,526
MARISHA: So 20% would be 15,000.

307
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,071
LIAM: 15's fair.

308
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:55,354
LAURA: Is it?

309
00:19:55,354 --> 00:19:57,930
LIAM: We put in a lot of work. If you wanna do
more, you can tell the children of Westruun,

310
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,894
personally--

311
00:19:58,894 --> 00:20:01,900
LAURA: No, I don't want to put-- I don't want to
put more, I want to take less, honestly.

312
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,943
SAM: Why do you hate children, Vex?

313
00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:07,534
TALIESIN: They're very dirty, they smell terrible
and--

314
00:20:07,534 --> 00:20:13,745
ASHLEY: Is it a terrible idea to let the people
decide? 'Cause maybe they would give us more?

315
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:18,745
SAM: The people, how? Hold a vote? Do you want
this money or do you want us to have it?

316
00:20:18,745 --> 00:20:22,179
ASHLEY: (sighs) I don't know, because maybe some
of it may not all be theirs.

317
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:27,502
SAM: Could you pray on it and ask what Sarenrae
would do?

318
00:20:27,502 --> 00:20:29,589
ASHLEY: I'm not going to pray over this money!

319
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:31,771
TALIESIN: I think if we ask them, they're just
going to argue amongst themselves.

320
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:32,818
SAM: Like us?

321
00:20:32,818 --> 00:20:34,131
MARISHA: Yeah, I agree.

322
00:20:34,131 --> 00:20:37,568
We would ask an entire town to come to a
decision.

323
00:20:37,568 --> 00:20:41,513
MATT: That's 300 pounds worth of gold. If you were
to put that within the Bag of Holding, that's the

324
00:20:41,513 --> 00:20:43,003
most you could carry.

325
00:20:43,003 --> 00:20:44,046
TRAVIS: That's all right.

326
00:20:44,046 --> 00:20:46,268
MATT: Your Bag of Holding, I'll say at this point,
would be full.

327
00:20:46,268 --> 00:20:49,745
TRAVIS: Maxed out? I could do that, plus I could
make myself really big for a little bit, too.

328
00:20:49,745 --> 00:20:52,971
LAURA: All right, but that's all we're taking.

329
00:20:52,971 --> 00:20:54,172
TRAVIS: Okay.

330
00:20:54,172 --> 00:21:02,064
LAURA: These people are in need. It's very hard to
say, but I don't want people being homeless and

331
00:21:02,064 --> 00:21:03,912
we're walking around with a bunch of gold
that's--

332
00:21:03,912 --> 00:21:08,543
TALIESIN: Beyond homeless, they're going to probably
have to run, so any money we give them will be

333
00:21:08,543 --> 00:21:12,700
money they will use to get out of town. To go
somewhere else.

334
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:21,090
MARISHA: Are we sure there's people capable in
town to bring back all this money? That we trust?

335
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:26,958
SAM: Sure, if they had enough people and enough
wagons. But, however, if we leave all this

336
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:31,683
gold just sitting here, won't brigands come and
rob it and pilfer it?

337
00:21:31,683 --> 00:21:33,401
LAURA: Probably. But what are we going to do?

338
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:37,767
SAM: We can hide it in some stone shit. Can't you
make some stone shit, to hide it? Some sort of--

339
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:39,872
LAURA: Oh, yeah, like a wall or something?

340
00:21:39,872 --> 00:21:46,118
SAM: I don't know, like a fake stone wall that
they could walk through? I don't know!

341
00:21:46,118 --> 00:21:48,138
LAURA: That only lasts for a while.

342
00:21:48,138 --> 00:21:55,618
MARISHA: I can Stone Shape like a little. No,
Stone Shape's permanent?

343
00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:57,876
MATT: Yeah, it's instant. You just (impact).

344
00:21:57,876 --> 00:22:04,521
MARISHA: Okay, Okay. Stone Shape's permanent, so I
could Stone Shape a little cubby and put a little

345
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:06,809
symbol over it so we know--

346
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:11,831
LAURA: Okay. But hide it well. I'll hide the hole
so that we tell them where it is.

347
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:16,873
MATT: Okay, so as you begin moving and trudging
through the gold, as you start moving it into that

348
00:22:16,873 --> 00:22:23,140
pile, you also discover 25 pounds' worth of
precious gems, most of them cut, some of which are

349
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,441
also rough.

350
00:22:24,441 --> 00:22:30,094
SAM: Do any of them have identifying marks, like
wedding rings, or--?

351
00:22:30,094 --> 00:22:35,857
MATT: I mean, there are a number of gems that look
like they're part of necklaces or rings, yes.

352
00:22:35,857 --> 00:22:37,666
LAURA: I wonder why he's asking.

353
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:43,019
MATT: There are a number of gem-encrusted rings that
would be very, very beautiful wedding rings if

354
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:44,449
they were utilized, yes.

355
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:46,310
SAM: Any particularly small ones?

356
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,055
(laughter)

357
00:22:48,055 --> 00:22:54,315
MATT: There are a number that could fit smaller
folked fingers

358
00:22:54,315 --> 00:22:56,051
SAM: I'll take a sapphire.

359
00:22:56,051 --> 00:23:01,265
MATT: Okay, that's about a 400 gold worth sapphire
ring.

360
00:23:01,265 --> 00:23:06,270
LIAM: "Oh! This one's nice!"

361
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:18,272
MATT: So note the 25 pounds' worth of gems. You
could attempt to ascertain their worth later. You

362
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:23,230
don't have the materials, nor the actual personal
knowledge to figure out exactly how much those gems

363
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:30,373
are worth at the moment. You do also find a bunch
of art and fine decor, brass and gold statues that

364
00:23:30,373 --> 00:23:36,683
were pulled out of homes, some art pieces,
silverware--

365
00:23:36,683 --> 00:23:43,103
SAM: Can I do some sort of arcana check on some of
the stuff? Have we done that already?

366
00:23:43,103 --> 00:23:49,313
MARISHA: We have the Hunk of Quall. I'll go ahead
and, here, I hand Scanlan the Hunk of Quall

367
00:23:49,313 --> 00:23:52,935
LIAM: Isn't Quall's Hunk just for Quall's stuff?
Or is it for everything?

368
00:23:52,935 --> 00:23:55,166
SAM: It just finds magical things, right?

369
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:57,160
LIAM: I thought it was just for his special
stuff.

370
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,745
MARISHA: It finds things with magical essences.

371
00:23:58,745 --> 00:24:00,647
TRAVIS: Scanlan, she's metaphorically handing you
the Quall.

372
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,632
MARISHA: Here, do you want the Hunk of Quall? Do
you want to hang onto it?

373
00:24:02,632 --> 00:24:04,260
SAM: Sure, I'll Quall it.

374
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,918
MATT: Okay, make an arcana check.

375
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:11,161
SAM: Ooh! 20.

376
00:24:11,161 --> 00:24:16,107
MATT: It sparks for a second, then goes dark
again. Looking at it, it seems like whatever it

377
00:24:16,107 --> 00:24:19,913
was designed to find, it has found and expended
most of its temporary enchantment.

378
00:24:19,913 --> 00:24:20,919
LAURA: Lame.

379
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,010
MARISHA: Boo.

380
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:29,636
SAM: So it doesn't do anything. So then I'll scan
through the stuff, looking for magical dope items--

381
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:31,045
MATT: Make an investigation check.

382
00:24:31,045 --> 00:24:33,749
LAURA: Are there any pretty paintings that grab
our attention?

383
00:24:33,749 --> 00:24:35,263
MATT: There are some very pretty paintings.

384
00:24:35,263 --> 00:24:37,244
TRAVIS: We're not taking any paintings.

385
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:39,585
LAURA: I could roll it up, Grog, it's not your
call!

386
00:24:39,585 --> 00:24:42,079
TRAVIS: They're very heavy.

387
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:45,559
SAM: I got a 14, anyone want to help me look for
magical scheisse?

388
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:47,260
ASHLEY: I'll help, I'll help you look!

389
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:53,710
MATT: So the armored gnome, Pike, leaps onto the
pile of gold coins and eagerly sifts through with

390
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,269
her giant ogre-ish hands.

391
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:57,429
(laughter)

392
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:00,372
ASHLEY: I just rolled a one.

393
00:25:00,372 --> 00:25:02,720
(laughter)

394
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,248
ASHLEY: There's nothing magical here, at all!

395
00:25:06,248 --> 00:25:07,640
SAM: Keyleth, you wanna help?

396
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,588
MARISHA: Huh?

397
00:25:08,588 --> 00:25:09,797
SAM: Just look for magical shit.

398
00:25:09,797 --> 00:25:14,800
MARISHA: I'm covered in-- I mean, I can--

399
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,607
SAM: Grog? Grog, look for magic.

400
00:25:16,607 --> 00:25:18,512
TRAVIS: Uh, I rolled a 16.

401
00:25:18,512 --> 00:25:19,946
SAM: (laughs) That's better than us!

402
00:25:19,946 --> 00:25:21,683
(laughter)

403
00:25:21,683 --> 00:25:23,002
TRAVIS: Hold on!

404
00:25:23,002 --> 00:25:29,330
MATT: His large size allows him to push through
large swaths of the pile of coins. You do pull

405
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:38,135
through what appears to be a very, very fine
ceramic jug that has runes carved along the sides,

406
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:43,350
and it rightfully should have broken under the
weight of most of the metal that had been placed

407
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,683
upon it or shifted around.

408
00:25:44,683 --> 00:25:45,878
TRAVIS: It's almost all broken anyway.

409
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,412
ALL: No!

410
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,776
SAM: Do any of us recognise the type of runes--

411
00:25:49,776 --> 00:25:52,751
LIAM: That really seems right up your alley,
buddy, but I think--

412
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,494
ASHLEY: Can I try reading the runes?

413
00:25:54,494 --> 00:26:00,464
MATT: You may. Go ahead and make an arcana check.
Actually, yeah, this would be arcana.

414
00:26:00,464 --> 00:26:03,110
ASHLEY: Just, arcana check?

415
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,353
LAURA: Come on!

416
00:26:05,353 --> 00:26:07,708
ASHLEY: 16?

417
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:14,484
MATT: 16? It's not a specific language, they're
all basic magical runes that are used in

418
00:26:14,484 --> 00:26:22,657
transmutation magic. You're not too familiar with
anything in this realm, but transmutation is the

419
00:26:22,657 --> 00:26:24,342
most you can get out of it.

420
00:26:24,342 --> 00:26:28,856
MARISHA: Hang on, wait, Grog! Grog, come here.

421
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:29,907
TRAVIS: Okay.

422
00:26:29,907 --> 00:26:32,712
MARISHA: I cast Create Water and I fill the jug
with water.

423
00:26:32,712 --> 00:26:33,831
MATT: Okay.

424
00:26:33,831 --> 00:26:38,049
SAM: It explodes.

425
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:40,438
TRAVIS: If I die because of this...

426
00:26:40,438 --> 00:26:42,576
(laughter)

427
00:26:42,576 --> 00:26:43,740
TRAVIS: (explosion)

428
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,879
MATT: What's interesting is, as you take the jug
from him, it's empty but you still hear sloshing,

429
00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:54,350
even though it's empty as you hold it before you.
You put water into it. It swishes around.

430
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,955
TRAVIS: Can I tip it upside down?

431
00:26:57,955 --> 00:27:00,339
MATT: Yep, you tip it upside down, and the water
spills out.

432
00:27:00,339 --> 00:27:01,743
TRAVIS: Anything else?

433
00:27:01,743 --> 00:27:02,772
MATT: Nope.

434
00:27:02,772 --> 00:27:04,160
TRAVIS: Can I shake it? Any more swishing?

435
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,619
MATT: You shake it, you still hear the swishing,
yeah.

436
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:06,830
TRAVIS: Can I put my head in the jug?

437
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:11,085
MATT: You do. (muffled) It blocks it, quite a bit.
Your voice is ringing in your ears.

438
00:27:11,085 --> 00:27:12,461
TRAVIS: Can I shake the jug?

439
00:27:12,461 --> 00:27:14,406
MATT: You still hear, around you (sloshing).

440
00:27:14,406 --> 00:27:15,654
TRAVIS: What is this witchcraft?

441
00:27:15,654 --> 00:27:17,163
(laughter)

442
00:27:17,163 --> 00:27:20,626
MARISHA: Do you hear the ocean, Grog? Do you hear
the ocean?

443
00:27:20,626 --> 00:27:23,287
TRAVIS: (echoes) No, no, no, no.

444
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:31,295
LIAM: Bored, Vax starts tossing gold coins off of
Grog's junk while it's on there.

445
00:27:31,295 --> 00:27:32,681
TRAVIS: What! What the hell?

446
00:27:32,681 --> 00:27:34,084
LIAM: They're very small.

447
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:39,832
TRAVIS: Oh. Come on, let me break it! It's
obviously broken.

448
00:27:39,832 --> 00:27:41,085
ALL: No!

449
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:43,271
ASHLEY: Can I try taking a sip?

450
00:27:43,271 --> 00:27:45,854
MATT: Sure, what are you-- You just take it?

451
00:27:45,854 --> 00:27:48,027
ASHLEY: Just seeing if I can just drink anything
in there.

452
00:27:48,027 --> 00:27:49,623
MATT: You tip it, nothing comes out of it.

453
00:27:49,623 --> 00:27:51,130
ASHLEY: Aww. I thought something cool was going to
happen.

454
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,429
LAURA: If you reach your hand in it, can you touch
the bottom of it?

455
00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:56,163
MATT: Yeah, you feel the bottom. It's all dry
ceramic.

456
00:27:56,163 --> 00:28:01,522
TALIESIN: I'm going to take the jug. I'm going to
put some of the dragon blood that's drying out

457
00:28:01,522 --> 00:28:03,443
in the jug and swirl it around a little bit.

458
00:28:03,443 --> 00:28:05,335
MATT: It swishes around.

459
00:28:05,335 --> 00:28:06,715
TALIESIN: And pour it out.

460
00:28:06,715 --> 00:28:07,911
MATT: It pours onto the ground.

461
00:28:07,911 --> 00:28:08,804
TALIESIN: It's just blood?

462
00:28:08,804 --> 00:28:09,686
MATT: It's just blood.

463
00:28:09,686 --> 00:28:13,020
MARISHA: I scoop up a little bit of dirt and I put
the dirt in the jug.

464
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,225
MATT: You have dirt in the jug

465
00:28:15,225 --> 00:28:16,092
MARISHA: Dump it out.

466
00:28:16,092 --> 00:28:17,176
SAM: This is a filthy jug.

467
00:28:17,176 --> 00:28:19,786
MATT: You turn it over and dirt falls across the
ground before you.

468
00:28:19,786 --> 00:28:20,747
(laughter)

469
00:28:20,747 --> 00:28:21,939
LAURA: Oh, what the fuck?

470
00:28:21,939 --> 00:28:23,188
SAM: Oh, I put some semen in it.

471
00:28:23,188 --> 00:28:24,136
LAURA: Gross!

472
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:25,228
TALIESIN: No!

473
00:28:25,228 --> 00:28:26,722
SAM: I think that's the magic!

474
00:28:26,722 --> 00:28:28,854
TRAVIS: Literally some sailors that are at sea?
Yeah.

475
00:28:28,854 --> 00:28:31,777
TALIESIN: A baby comes out. Now this is your
responsibility.

476
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:38,736
MATT: You go to the docks of Emon. No. You'll have
to take some time with this to discern what it

477
00:28:38,736 --> 00:28:39,884
actually does.

478
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,498
SAM: All right, we'll just hang onto it.

479
00:28:41,498 --> 00:28:44,324
ASHLEY: What if it's just like a Jug of Holding?
Like you could just keep putting stuff in it?

480
00:28:44,324 --> 00:28:47,196
LAURA: Yeah, but everything's been pouring out but
there's still something in the bottom of it.

481
00:28:47,196 --> 00:28:49,632
TALIESIN: Let's take it to an expert, we'll find
out later.

482
00:28:49,632 --> 00:28:51,441
LIAM: There are smarter people than us.

483
00:28:51,441 --> 00:28:57,543
MATT: You also find amongst this chaos a number of
glass shards, and you start discerning that there

484
00:28:57,543 --> 00:29:04,181
are a number of empty vials that were shattered
and broken across the floor in this area and

485
00:29:04,181 --> 00:29:11,701
across the coins. A bunch of empty vials.

486
00:29:11,701 --> 00:29:13,684
LAURA: Potions all mixing together?

487
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:21,272
MATT: A lot of things that were seemingly recently
used in the recovery of the large entity. However,

488
00:29:21,272 --> 00:29:31,157
there is one unbroken vial that you see that
contains a cloudy grey oil that swishes around on

489
00:29:31,157 --> 00:29:37,260
the inside; some of it tends to seep through the
glass, almost, and then evaporate instantaneously

490
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,416
on touching the air.

491
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:39,824
LAURA: Ooh! Who wants this creepy looking shit?

492
00:29:39,824 --> 00:29:41,822
SAM: I'll take it! Can I? Have I seen anything
like this before?

493
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,049
MATT: You haven't, actually.

494
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:45,613
SAM: Dammit. Can I sniff it to get any clues?

495
00:29:45,613 --> 00:29:49,844
MATT: You sniff it and it smells metallic,
strangely, as you pull the stopper off. It's not

496
00:29:49,844 --> 00:29:54,779
liquid, it's more like a thick oil. It's very
viscous and slowly swishes in place as you rotate

497
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:55,905
the glass.

498
00:29:55,905 --> 00:29:57,223
LAURA: I bet Gilmore would know what that was.

499
00:29:57,223 --> 00:29:59,567
SAM: I'll hang onto this for now. It might be
massage oil.

500
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:00,723
LAURA: What?

501
00:30:00,723 --> 00:30:02,635
SAM: You never know.

502
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:07,514
MATT: You never know. You do also rummage through.
You find another unbroken-- the glass itself is

503
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:15,430
cracked a little bit, but it's still intact-- what
appears to be a small brown, silver and gray

504
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:21,530
layered liquid. It's like three different layers
that are all sediment and separate from each

505
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:25,247
other, based on how it's been laying there.

506
00:30:25,247 --> 00:30:28,567
LAURA: Ahh! Should we put this inside another glass
container so if it breaks, it's okay?

507
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:35,557
TALIESIN: Honestly, I think just putting it in the
biological--

508
00:30:35,557 --> 00:30:37,475
LAURA: The Bag of Colding?

509
00:30:37,475 --> 00:30:40,130
TALIESIN: --the Bag of Colding. Might be wise.

510
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:44,189
LAURA: All right. Layered gray-brown potion is
what I'm writing.

511
00:30:44,189 --> 00:30:49,329
MATT: It's got layers of brown, silver and grey.

512
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:51,685
TRAVIS: So mostly grey.

513
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:53,233
MARISHA: It's like a birthday cake shot?

514
00:30:53,233 --> 00:30:56,223
MATT: Kind of. And then as you push the last of
the coins in this hole that you've made in the

515
00:30:56,223 --> 00:31:00,618
side of the wall to hide it out of the
way, you do also find at the very bottom of this

516
00:31:00,618 --> 00:31:07,198
what looks like an old book of some kind, like a
tome, it's about this big with a heavy thick

517
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,344
leather binding around it.

518
00:31:09,344 --> 00:31:11,018
LAURA: Can we read it?

519
00:31:11,018 --> 00:31:13,155
SAM: No, this could be the spellbook.

520
00:31:13,155 --> 00:31:17,260
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah! Dres Vina's--

521
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,920
MARISHA: Dres Vina's spellbook?

522
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,534
TRAVIS: Abjurist Noja's.

523
00:31:21,534 --> 00:31:23,045
MARISHA: Abjurist Noja, that's right.

524
00:31:23,045 --> 00:31:27,389
SAM: Abjurist Noja's. Does it look like a
spellbook? Have we seen a spellbook before?

525
00:31:27,389 --> 00:31:32,839
MATT: You look through and as you open it up, the
words are scrambled and, as you focus for a

526
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:40,157
second, they seem to reassemble them in Common.
And as you read through, the first page has a

527
00:31:40,157 --> 00:31:45,522
large title across the top that says: "Tome of
Leadership and Influence."

528
00:31:45,522 --> 00:31:49,118
LIAM: This is special.

529
00:31:49,118 --> 00:31:53,894
LAURA: It is! Who should read it? I want to read
it right now!

530
00:31:53,894 --> 00:31:56,520
SAM: Well, only some of us can read, no offense.

531
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,894
TRAVIS: Fuck off. Are there any pictures in the
book?

532
00:31:59,894 --> 00:32:03,737
MATT: There are no pictures, it is pure text. Your
favorite.

533
00:32:03,737 --> 00:32:07,343
TRAVIS: Completely worthless. It's awful cold--

534
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:10,432
LAURA: If Grog looks at it, does it reassemble
itself in stick figures?

535
00:32:10,432 --> 00:32:16,498
MATT: It's interesting. You look at the pages, and
the lines don't make sense to you but for some

536
00:32:16,498 --> 00:32:23,300
reason you understand the gist of what the content
is. It goes beyond the barrier of language and,

537
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:27,046
for a second, it's almost like there are pictures,
but the pictures are assembled by a bunch of tiny

538
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:31,415
lines in a row and different shapes that show you
what it means!

539
00:32:31,415 --> 00:32:35,509
TRAVIS: See, it's a book about leadership, clearly
it wants to communicate something to me--

540
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:36,722
ASHLEY: Intelligence--

541
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:37,861
TRAVIS: Intelligence, right, thank you.

542
00:32:37,861 --> 00:32:40,820
LIAM: This is like the Grognak comic book in
Fallout, is what this is.

543
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,273
MARISHA: See, I was going to say How to Win
Friends and Influence People.

544
00:32:44,273 --> 00:32:46,269
SAM: As the unofficial leader of the group--

545
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:47,629
LAURA: Yeah? Really Scanlan?

546
00:32:47,629 --> 00:32:51,176
SAM: --I don't really need the book. So perhaps
Percy should look at it.

547
00:32:51,176 --> 00:32:54,687
TALIESIN: I was thinking perhaps Keyleth might
actually--

548
00:32:54,687 --> 00:32:57,511
LAURA: That's true! You do have a people to rule.
Both of you do.

549
00:32:57,511 --> 00:32:59,248
TALIESIN: Yeah, Keyleth, perhaps, might want to
take this book.

550
00:32:59,248 --> 00:33:01,787
I am not leading anyone.

551
00:33:01,787 --> 00:33:04,564
MARISHA: Thank you, Scanlan. Thank you.

552
00:33:04,564 --> 00:33:07,532
TRAVIS: Keyleth, you wanna trade the book for this
stupid vase?

553
00:33:07,532 --> 00:33:12,040
SAM: It's not Secret Santa, we're not trading
things.

554
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,123
(laughter)

555
00:33:16,123 --> 00:33:17,391
TRAVIS: Fine.

556
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:22,621
MARISHA: I mean, I guess because I happen to be
holding the vase at the time, sure. No you can--

557
00:33:22,621 --> 00:33:23,896
you can have it

558
00:33:23,896 --> 00:33:25,037
TRAVIS: I can have the book?!

559
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:26,659
MARISHA: No, you can have the vase.

560
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:29,227
ASHLEY: Wait, what's the book? The book is
Leadership and what?

561
00:33:29,227 --> 00:33:33,104
MATT: Leadership and Influence. If you guys want
to take the evening to kind of look over these

562
00:33:33,104 --> 00:33:35,409
items, you could probably discern most of the
nature of them.

563
00:33:35,409 --> 00:33:37,959
SAM: Okay, well, let's do that. Let's take a look
at them overnight.

564
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:42,106
MARISHA: I'm going to continue eviscerating a
dragon.

565
00:33:42,106 --> 00:33:50,943
MATT: You get to the point where you guys, late
into the night, have carved away roughly 40

566
00:33:50,943 --> 00:33:57,953
functional pounds of hide before you're exhausted.
You're exhausted and there's still plenty of hide

567
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:04,366
to pull off of, but it would take you a week and
you can notice the more you go, the scent is

568
00:34:04,366 --> 00:34:08,423
changing. It's almost like the acidic contents of
the body are beginning to accelerate

569
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:14,926
decomposition. It is actually, essentially, now
that the body is no longer living, the acidic bile

570
00:34:14,926 --> 00:34:20,251
that it usually utilizes as a weapon is slowly
consuming its remains.

571
00:34:20,251 --> 00:34:22,594
TALIESIN: I'm perfectly content with 40.

572
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:25,732
MARISHA: Yeah, we can make a decent amount of
armor with 40 pounds--

573
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:30,225
MATT: So whoever wants to carry that, because it's
got to be carried, because the Bag of Holding is full.

574
00:34:30,225 --> 00:34:31,681
TRAVIS: I'll take it.

575
00:34:31,681 --> 00:34:33,934
ASHLEY: I can carry some. I'm strong.

576
00:34:33,934 --> 00:34:36,153
LAURA: How much does the biological bag hold?

577
00:34:36,153 --> 00:34:38,065
MATT: The biological bag holds 100 pounds.

578
00:34:38,065 --> 00:34:44,160
LAURA: I could put some in there. I don't have
very much in here. It's all light.

579
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,516
MATT: Okay, so there you go.

580
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:46,547
MARISHA: Yeah. Cool, cool, cool.

581
00:34:46,547 --> 00:34:47,904
LAURA: So 40 pounds? I'll mark that down.

582
00:34:47,904 --> 00:34:49,849
MATT: So 40 pounds of black dragon hide.

583
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:51,652
TRAVIS: You're carrying around 100 pounds of
shit?

584
00:34:51,652 --> 00:34:54,720
LAURA: It's magic, it's weightless.

585
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:03,595
MATT: The Bag of Colding. The bag itself weighs
five pounds to her, but can contain 100 pounds. So,

586
00:35:03,595 --> 00:35:08,724
as you guys work through the evening, who's
looking over which items? Who's looking over the book?

587
00:35:08,724 --> 00:35:10,269
SAM: I'm looking over the book.

588
00:35:10,269 --> 00:35:13,578
TRAVIS: Will you stand up there and get me the
vase?

589
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,973
MATT: There is the vase for Grog--

590
00:35:16,973 --> 00:35:21,661
LAURA: Was there other things to look at? I'll
look at the vial that I have, the layered one.

591
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,042
TRAVIS: Gimme. Gimme!

592
00:35:23,042 --> 00:35:27,734
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit and try and get my gun
working again--

593
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:32,117
LIAM: They're no good for me, but I think last
week you said something about spears or javelins

594
00:35:32,117 --> 00:35:33,584
or something?

595
00:35:33,584 --> 00:35:39,474
MATT: There are various basic weapons in there,
but nothing that comes across as anything beyond

596
00:35:39,474 --> 00:35:41,321
well-crafted weaponry that was gathered.

597
00:35:41,321 --> 00:35:42,926
LIAM: There any shortswords in the pile?

598
00:35:42,926 --> 00:35:46,373
MATT: There are a couple. A lot of them have been
dinged up and wrecked but there are two regular

599
00:35:46,373 --> 00:35:49,181
shortswords that seem to be functional and not
damaged too heavily.

600
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:51,191
LIAM: I'm going to scoop them up

601
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,826
MATT: Okay. So two shortswords.

602
00:35:52,826 --> 00:35:57,910
TALIESIN: I don't know how I even feel about that.

603
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:08,764
MATT: So, Percy? The level of broken that Bad News
is would require a workshop of some kind. Even

604
00:36:08,764 --> 00:36:10,082
just basic blacksmithing tools--

605
00:36:10,082 --> 00:36:13,108
TALIESIN: I was going to use the workshop that's
in the house.

606
00:36:13,108 --> 00:36:15,573
MATT: Okay, if you guys want to go and rest in the
house, then that's doable.

607
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,154
SAM: Yes, I'm doing the house.

608
00:36:17,154 --> 00:36:21,866
MATT: Okay, all of you hop into Scanlan's
Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion.

609
00:36:21,866 --> 00:36:23,397
LIAM: Yeah! Chicken!

610
00:36:23,397 --> 00:36:27,529
MATT: Get yourself a delightful chicken dinner.

611
00:36:27,529 --> 00:36:31,201
SAM: I know what that spell is, you just pass
through walls like a ghost.

612
00:36:31,201 --> 00:36:33,657
MARISHA: Through walls and stuff, yeah. So what's
that deal?

613
00:36:33,657 --> 00:36:36,892
SAM: This is +2 to charisma, permanently.

614
00:36:36,892 --> 00:36:41,759
TRAVIS: This is fucking brilliant.

615
00:36:41,759 --> 00:36:44,560
LAURA: Does anybody need-- Who's shit at
climbing?

616
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,776
SAM: Pike?

617
00:36:47,776 --> 00:36:48,871
ASHLEY: Hey!

618
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:51,290
(laughter)

619
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,612
ASHLEY: Wait a minute! Am I shit at climbing?

620
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:57,102
MATT: No, your strength's pretty high. You can
rock climb.

621
00:36:57,102 --> 00:36:58,493
ASHLEY: I'm strong!

622
00:36:58,493 --> 00:36:59,795
LAURA: Oh, it's based on strength?

623
00:36:59,795 --> 00:37:00,809
MATT: Climbing is, yeah.

624
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:02,019
LAURA: Oh, we're shit at climbing!

625
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:02,902
LIAM: I'm okay.

626
00:37:02,902 --> 00:37:03,731
LAURA: I'm shit.

627
00:37:03,731 --> 00:37:08,673
LIAM: Oh, hey, by the way. Take your fucking shoes
off and give them back to me.

628
00:37:08,673 --> 00:37:10,611
LAURA: Oh what, these fabulous shoes that fit me
perfectly?

629
00:37:10,611 --> 00:37:13,121
LIAM: Yeah, give them to me or I'll just take them
while you're sleeping, easily.

630
00:37:13,121 --> 00:37:16,175
LAURA: You think you could do that, like I wouldn't
notice you sneaking up?

631
00:37:16,175 --> 00:37:17,482
LIAM: So fucking easily.

632
00:37:17,482 --> 00:37:19,020
LAURA: I don't believe it!

633
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,599
LIAM: Keep your boots, then. See if they're there
in the morning.

634
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,007
LAURA: All right.

635
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:28,151
MATT: (laughs) As you all find yourselves to rest
within the confines, the comfortable confines, of

636
00:37:28,151 --> 00:37:32,431
Scanlan's mansion, Percy, I want you to go ahead
and make a tinkering check.

637
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:36,990
TALIESIN: That's tinkering is plus four, plus
proficiency bonus, plus a d20, if I recall?

638
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:40,663
MATT: It's proficiency bonus, plus your dex for
the purposes of fixing this.

639
00:37:40,663 --> 00:37:47,826
TALIESIN: Okay, that's even better. That'll do.
20.

640
00:37:47,826 --> 00:37:56,922
MATT: 20, okay. It takes you most of the evening.
You'll rest up but we'll say for the purposes of

641
00:37:56,922 --> 00:38:02,678
this you've only regained two hit dice for the
evening's rest, of your spent hit dice.

642
00:38:02,678 --> 00:38:06,653
TALIESIN: Okay. So I'm just down two hit dice?

643
00:38:06,653 --> 00:38:14,405
MATT: Yeah. Any that you've used, if you used any,
you don't recover any but two. Normally you'd

644
00:38:14,405 --> 00:38:19,652
recover half of your unused hit dice right now.
The gun is fixed, the materials that you were

645
00:38:19,652 --> 00:38:23,783
required to use will cost you half as much as the
actual weapon is worth.

646
00:38:23,783 --> 00:38:25,551
TALIESIN: Lord almighty.

647
00:38:25,551 --> 00:38:34,446
MATT: Which, let me look at my list here for
that-- It's going to come to roughly 400 gold in

648
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:36,363
materials to repair.

649
00:38:36,363 --> 00:38:39,013
TALIESIN: I thought it was a more expensive gun
than that, I feel a little better. Oh, that's

650
00:38:39,013 --> 00:38:40,656
right, it's the cheap gun of the two.

651
00:38:40,656 --> 00:38:42,870
LAURA: What about the Bad News? You broke that one
too, didn't you?

652
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:49,617
TALIESIN: That was Bad News. The other gun was
working. I broke it but it was just jammed. Bad

653
00:38:49,617 --> 00:38:51,279
News was like (creaking).

654
00:38:51,279 --> 00:38:57,734
MATT: All right, so the evening's rest goes
relatively uneventful.

655
00:38:57,734 --> 00:39:05,205
SAM: I've commanded ten of my invisible guards to
protect Vex's feet.

656
00:39:05,205 --> 00:39:08,685
(laughter)

657
00:39:08,685 --> 00:39:12,374
MATT: Okay! Vax?

658
00:39:12,374 --> 00:39:15,958
LIAM: So in the middle of the night, I'd like to
swing by the kitchen--

659
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:21,778
LAURA: I'm sleeping with them tucked up under me.
I'm going to sleep like, you know how little kids

660
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:25,826
sleep with their butts in the air and their feet
are tucked under them? That's how I'm-- yeah.

661
00:39:25,826 --> 00:39:28,028
MATT: (laughs) Okay!

662
00:39:28,028 --> 00:39:36,311
LIAM: Okay. I go by the kitchen and I get a mug of
water and some spices. Just some various, simple

663
00:39:36,311 --> 00:39:42,016
stuff-- I'd like to sneak into my sister's room.
I'd like to check the door for traps.

664
00:39:42,016 --> 00:39:46,453
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check!

665
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:51,908
LIAM: It's not very high. Oh, no, yes it is. It's
a 20.

666
00:39:51,908 --> 00:39:54,354
MATT: All right, it does not appear to be trapped,
however it is locked.

667
00:39:54,354 --> 00:39:56,072
LIAM: Okay, I'd like to pick that lock.

668
00:39:56,072 --> 00:39:57,877
LAURA: Do I notice this happening?

669
00:39:57,877 --> 00:39:59,353
LIAM: 30. You're sleeping.

670
00:39:59,353 --> 00:40:02,128
LAURA: Yeah, but I have a really good passive
perception, bitch!

671
00:40:02,128 --> 00:40:03,700
LIAM: All right, 30 on the trap.

672
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,562
MATT: Right, on the lock you mean--

673
00:40:05,562 --> 00:40:10,225
LIAM: On the lock, yeah-- I'd like to sneak in.

674
00:40:10,225 --> 00:40:17,926
MATT: Ever so quiet, you make it into the room.
Pull the door close to closed, but not entirely.

675
00:40:17,926 --> 00:40:24,277
You look up in what little bit of low firelight
is coming from a distant fireplace in the far

676
00:40:24,277 --> 00:40:30,491
corner that's down to very, very simple embers,
you see drifting in a semi-circle around the bed,

677
00:40:30,491 --> 00:40:34,894
ten spiritual servants, all arms crossed, just
staring right at you--

678
00:40:34,894 --> 00:40:38,024
LIAM: Protecting her feet, right? That was the
command.

679
00:40:38,024 --> 00:40:40,508
SAM: Protect her feet. That was the command.

680
00:40:40,508 --> 00:40:46,309
LIAM: I walk in. They're not on her feet. I want
nothing to do with her feet, guys, I just want

681
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:48,017
those shoes that she's hugging.

682
00:40:48,017 --> 00:40:51,282
LAURA: No, I have the shoes on my feet--

683
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,993
LIAM: You said you were hugging them up here like
this.

684
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:56,211
LAURA: No, no, no. I said I'm sleeping with my
feet tucked up under me.

685
00:40:56,211 --> 00:40:59,005
LIAM: Like how? Like Cirque du Soleil?

686
00:40:59,005 --> 00:41:02,535
LAURA: Like child's pose, Like child's pose! Yoga,
bitch! You know what I'm talking about--

687
00:41:02,535 --> 00:41:04,290
LIAM: With your feet here?

688
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:07,961
LAURA: No! Like this.

689
00:41:07,961 --> 00:41:10,299
LIAM: That's what you said!

690
00:41:10,299 --> 00:41:14,994
LAURA: Here I'll show you. Sorry, guys, you don't
get to see-- But it's like this, Liam--

691
00:41:14,994 --> 00:41:17,526
SAM: Oh, that's so vulgar!

692
00:41:17,526 --> 00:41:19,124
LAURA: No, it's not!

693
00:41:19,124 --> 00:41:21,888
(laughter)

694
00:41:21,888 --> 00:41:33,036
LIAM: Okay, guys, this is a little bit of family
trouble, just give me a minute. And I leap on top

695
00:41:33,036 --> 00:41:37,391
of her, I take the cup of water and I splash it in
her face and I throw flour on her face like that!

696
00:41:37,391 --> 00:41:39,226
LAURA: What?! What the fuck?!

697
00:41:39,226 --> 00:41:41,977
LIAM: Give me my boots! Give me my boots! You give
me my damn boots!

698
00:41:41,977 --> 00:41:43,470
(laughter)

699
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:47,943
MATT: You are immediately pulled off of the bed,
slammed onto the ground on the floor--

700
00:41:47,943 --> 00:41:49,576
LIAM: I don't get to roll?!

701
00:41:49,576 --> 00:41:51,582
MATT: --as all the spirits hold you down. No.

702
00:41:51,582 --> 00:41:52,941
LIAM: No dexterity, no nothing?!

703
00:41:52,941 --> 00:41:56,518
MATT: No, because the moment that you go ahead and
splash the water and go towards her, they're on

704
00:41:56,518 --> 00:41:58,139
top of you, this isn't about dodging--

705
00:41:58,139 --> 00:41:59,405
LIAM: I left her feet alone!

706
00:41:59,405 --> 00:42:02,655
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait. What's happening? Don't
attack him! Don't attack him!

707
00:42:02,655 --> 00:42:05,356
MATT: Right. It was less of you trying to avoid
and more to see if they could grab you.

708
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,601
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

709
00:42:06,601 --> 00:42:08,132
(laughter)

710
00:42:08,132 --> 00:42:12,033
MATT: So you're vaulted off and slammed onto the
ground and they're just holding you there. Not

711
00:42:12,033 --> 00:42:13,477
attacking you, they're just holding you--

712
00:42:13,477 --> 00:42:19,180
LIAM: Give me my boots, you greedy shitbird.

713
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,777
LAURA: What? You think I was really going to keep
them?

714
00:42:21,777 --> 00:42:26,528
LIAM: I want them now. I don't trust you as far as
I can throw you. I want you to-- just keep holding

715
00:42:26,528 --> 00:42:29,093
me up, guys. I want you to put them on my feet
now.

716
00:42:29,093 --> 00:42:36,762
LAURA: But they look so good on me. And your feet
are so smelly! Are you-- are you mad?

717
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:42,771
LIAM: I gave up my life for you. I will have my
shoes. <i>Please.</i>

718
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:43,864
LAURA: All right.

719
00:42:43,864 --> 00:42:46,710
MATT: One of the servants begins slowly going
towards your foot and (sniffs).

720
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:47,924
(laughter)

721
00:42:47,924 --> 00:42:49,947
LAURA: They're smelly, they're really smelly.
See?

722
00:42:49,947 --> 00:42:51,515
LIAM: We should cap 'em, right boys?

723
00:42:51,515 --> 00:42:54,341
LAURA: What if--?

724
00:42:54,341 --> 00:42:56,258
SAM: You think any of my servants are boys?

725
00:42:56,258 --> 00:43:00,476
(laughter)

726
00:43:00,476 --> 00:43:05,379
LIAM: I assume they have both sets of parts,
actually--

727
00:43:05,379 --> 00:43:07,110
SAM: That's true, that's true.

728
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:09,076
(laughter)

729
00:43:09,076 --> 00:43:12,819
LAURA: I suppose I could part with them.

730
00:43:12,819 --> 00:43:16,250
LIAM: Waiting.

731
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:22,211
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait. Ahh! I'm not putting them
on your feet.

732
00:43:22,211 --> 00:43:23,390
LIAM: Sure you are.

733
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:30,299
LAURA: No, I am <i>not!</i> But before I do, I want
payment, for these boots. What's going on with you

734
00:43:30,299 --> 00:43:31,669
and Keyleth?

735
00:43:31,669 --> 00:43:33,922
(laughter)

736
00:43:33,922 --> 00:43:36,617
LAURA: Right here. I'll give you these boots if
you tell me.

737
00:43:36,617 --> 00:43:44,979
LIAM: I could rescind my deal with an all-powerful
deity and let you fall to the ground or you could

738
00:43:44,979 --> 00:43:48,407
hear about my personals. What's your choice?

739
00:43:48,407 --> 00:43:51,203
LAURA: What?

740
00:43:51,203 --> 00:43:56,345
LIAM: Give me my fucking boots!

741
00:43:56,345 --> 00:44:07,755
LAURA: You love her? You love her so much. Take
one, right here. You could put it on, cover up at

742
00:44:07,755 --> 00:44:09,967
least one foul stench in the room.

743
00:44:09,967 --> 00:44:11,986
LIAM: No, I can't because they're holding me
around the arms--

744
00:44:11,986 --> 00:44:15,999
MATT: Two of the servants take the boot from her
and start putting it on your feet. Kind of polish

745
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,759
it a little bit.

746
00:44:17,759 --> 00:44:21,884
LAURA: Does she feel the same way about you?

747
00:44:21,884 --> 00:44:24,047
LIAM: Ask her.

748
00:44:24,047 --> 00:44:30,337
LAURA: (gasps) Maybe I will. Fine. Here's your
other boot. Servants--

749
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:34,053
MATT: They take it and they hold you down even
still forcefully, grab your other leg and gingerly

750
00:44:34,053 --> 00:44:36,746
put the other boot on. Polish it--

751
00:44:36,746 --> 00:44:40,731
LAURA: Now <i>go to sleep,</i> we fought a dragon
yesterday.

752
00:44:40,731 --> 00:44:44,153
LIAM: (laughs) I love you, but you are a terrible
person. And I walk out the door.

753
00:44:44,153 --> 00:44:47,313
MATT: (laughs) And you walk away.

754
00:44:47,313 --> 00:44:51,301
LAURA: (coughs) I spend 15 minutes getting all the
flour off of my bed.

755
00:44:51,301 --> 00:44:54,123
MARISHA: I go to Scanlan. Scanlan?

756
00:44:54,123 --> 00:44:55,322
SAM: Oi?

757
00:44:55,322 --> 00:45:00,067
MARISHA: Did I hear you had a hot spring, or
something like that? Or like a spa here? I feel

758
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:03,542
like you'd have a spa-- Because I am covered in
dragon bile.

759
00:45:03,542 --> 00:45:05,070
SAM: Ooh, yes. Well--

760
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:07,935
MARISHA: Not. no, no.

761
00:45:07,935 --> 00:45:09,130
SAM: No?

762
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:10,817
MARISHA: Just, can you point me in the direction
of the spa?

763
00:45:10,817 --> 00:45:16,090
SAM: Oh, I'm not coming with you. Don't worry,
darling. Yes, it's downstairs in the third

764
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,344
basement-- I don't know!

765
00:45:17,344 --> 00:45:18,666
(laughter)

766
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:19,642
MARISHA: Thank you!

767
00:45:19,642 --> 00:45:24,304
MATT: You hear a (stone shifting) shift as a third
basement is created in the bottom of the

768
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:25,609
mansion--

769
00:45:25,609 --> 00:45:27,263
SAM: Right next to the boiler room!

770
00:45:27,263 --> 00:45:30,817
MATT: Another shake as a boiler room has now
apparated right next--

771
00:45:30,817 --> 00:45:34,110
MARISHA: Is it a very fantastic bathhouse?

772
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:40,430
MATT: It's not bad, actually. It's a fine natural
hot spring, a comfortable hot tub temperature.

773
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:44,361
SAM: It's got Russian temperature, Swedish
temperature, Finnish temperature--

774
00:45:44,361 --> 00:45:51,873
MARISHA: I go over the comms and I say: hey, Vex,
Pike, I think I just found the new hangout spot

775
00:45:51,873 --> 00:45:53,153
for the ladies--

776
00:45:53,153 --> 00:45:54,269
ASHLEY: Where are you?

777
00:45:54,269 --> 00:45:55,766
MARISHA: I'm in the third basement, come down!

778
00:45:55,766 --> 00:45:57,201
TALIESIN: There's a third basement?

779
00:45:57,201 --> 00:45:59,299
TRAVIS: What's in the third basement?

780
00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:00,650
SAM: Yeah, we can all hear you--

781
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:03,374
TALIESIN: Yeah we can all hear you. You can't just
pick people, you are aware of that?

782
00:46:03,374 --> 00:46:10,478
MARISHA: Oh, I mean. Shit! Uh. This is not
Keyleth, this is another transmission you're

783
00:46:10,478 --> 00:46:14,007
picking up, it's-- I'll change the channel

784
00:46:14,007 --> 00:46:16,154
TRAVIS: (shouting) Party down in the third
basement!

785
00:46:16,154 --> 00:46:20,658
LAURA: All right, let's go down.

786
00:46:20,658 --> 00:46:22,442
TRAVIS: We're all going down.

787
00:46:22,442 --> 00:46:30,524
MATT: So, ladies, you all convene in this
beautiful hot, air filled with steam. There's a

788
00:46:30,524 --> 00:46:35,470
fountain in the corner with some rocks and some
nice plants around the area. There's a beautiful

789
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:39,090
giant portrait of Scanlan, nude, sprawled over a
rock--

790
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:41,091
(laughter)

791
00:46:41,091 --> 00:46:44,181
MATT: With a towel just gently placed on his knee.

792
00:46:44,181 --> 00:46:47,462
(laughter)

793
00:46:47,462 --> 00:46:49,085
SAM: Not covering anything.

794
00:46:49,085 --> 00:46:56,437
MATT: No, no. It's decorative. As soon as you all
sink in this moment, the door opens behind you as

795
00:46:56,437 --> 00:46:58,528
Percy and Grog come storming in.

796
00:46:58,528 --> 00:47:01,034
TRAVIS: Shit yeah! CANNONBALL!

797
00:47:01,034 --> 00:47:03,826
LAURA: Well, this was peaceful--

798
00:47:03,826 --> 00:47:09,906
TRAVIS: Heh! Look at Scanlan's wiener in that
picture. (laughs)

799
00:47:09,906 --> 00:47:12,095
ASHLEY: I'm going to cannonball in too.

800
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:13,620
MATT: Pike jumps in--

801
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:19,268
TALIESIN: I'm taking off my glasses and going to
go soak in a corner quietly.

802
00:47:19,268 --> 00:47:21,492
LAURA: I go find Keyleth.

803
00:47:21,492 --> 00:47:33,209
MATT: All right, so you guys have made your way
comfortable into the hot spring. Vex saunters over

804
00:47:33,209 --> 00:47:35,851
to you with a look of intention on her face.

805
00:47:35,851 --> 00:47:39,596
MARISHA: You look so intent.

806
00:47:39,596 --> 00:47:43,825
LAURA: Yes. Do you like the hot springs?

807
00:47:43,825 --> 00:47:47,450
MARISHA: I love the hot springs, aren't they
fantastic?

808
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:51,357
LAURA: I do too. I sit down next to her. So my
brother.

809
00:47:51,357 --> 00:47:53,829
MARISHA: (coughs)

810
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:58,994
LAURA: What's going on with you guys? Because I
just asked him and he got <i>really</i> awkward. I

811
00:47:58,994 --> 00:48:03,890
mean, is it for real? Is it definitely happening?
Are you guys "in love?" Getting married? Having

812
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:06,020
babies? Little druid babies?

813
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:17,271
MARISHA: Oh wow, you just said a lot of things in
a very short space of time. You know, we just

814
00:48:17,271 --> 00:48:18,635
killed a dragon.

815
00:48:18,635 --> 00:48:19,599
LAURA: We did.

816
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:20,793
MARISHA: We just killed a dragon.

817
00:48:20,793 --> 00:48:22,390
LAURA: I know, I feel so alive!

818
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:31,888
MARISHA: Okay. So that's about as far as I got. I
wasn't sure if I was going to, you know, live past

819
00:48:31,888 --> 00:48:35,097
that. I wasn't sure if he was going to live past
that. I wasn't sure if you were going to live past

820
00:48:35,097 --> 00:48:36,519
that. Really, any of us--

821
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:37,486
LAURA: But we did.

822
00:48:37,486 --> 00:48:49,118
MARISHA: Yeah we did, we did. Now there's three
more. And I have a lot that I still have to do and

823
00:48:49,118 --> 00:48:53,998
still have to figure out about myself.

824
00:48:53,998 --> 00:49:02,896
LAURA: So do you like him? Do you love him? That's
an answer, you can just answer it, it's not a big

825
00:49:02,896 --> 00:49:04,869
deal, you just say yes or no--

826
00:49:04,869 --> 00:49:18,974
MARISHA: (sighs) I'm afraid what will happen if I
say yes.

827
00:49:18,974 --> 00:49:24,073
LAURA: Okay, that's not what I asked, though.
Don't think about the fear. Think about what

828
00:49:24,073 --> 00:49:25,461
you're feeling.

829
00:49:25,461 --> 00:49:30,210
MARISHA: Maybe.

830
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:33,012
LAURA: (whispering) I think that's a yes.

831
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:36,714
MARISHA: Will you hate me if I do?

832
00:49:36,714 --> 00:49:41,468
LAURA: No.

833
00:49:41,468 --> 00:49:49,354
MARISHA: You sure? Because I kind of thought you
might for a very long time.

834
00:49:49,354 --> 00:49:56,397
LAURA: You know. I thought I might as well, but
here's the thing. We've been through a lot. We

835
00:49:56,397 --> 00:50:04,405
face death on a very regular basis. (sighs) And I
see the way he looks at you, and I see the way you

836
00:50:04,405 --> 00:50:14,242
look at him. And happiness is fleeting in this
world; we don't know when it will end. Take

837
00:50:14,242 --> 00:50:17,987
advantage of it while you can. And stop living in
fear.

838
00:50:17,987 --> 00:50:21,170
MARISHA: Maybe we're not people who are allowed
happiness.

839
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:23,250
LAURA: That's bullshit, Keyleth.

840
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:33,922
MARISHA: And what happens if I lose either of
you?

841
00:50:33,922 --> 00:50:44,587
LAURA: Well, you go on. You can't think about
that!

842
00:50:44,587 --> 00:50:53,663
MARISHA: You've been to the other side. What did
you see? Anything? Is there an afterlife?

843
00:50:53,663 --> 00:51:08,221
LAURA: Well, I wasn't there for very long, but I
think there can be. My brother serves Death,

844
00:51:08,221 --> 00:51:10,091
Keyleth!

845
00:51:10,091 --> 00:51:13,343
MARISHA: And death is a natural thing that happens
with or without him.

846
00:51:13,343 --> 00:51:15,320
LAURA: This is true!

847
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:31,263
MARISHA: Do you believe in the gods? Do you
believe that Vax actually serves Death?

848
00:51:31,263 --> 00:51:37,528
LAURA: Yes. Yes I do.

849
00:51:37,528 --> 00:51:40,100
MARISHA: What do you think that means for the rest
of us?

850
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:56,378
LAURA: I think it means that-- I think it means
that what we do has a purpose. Regardless of the

851
00:51:56,378 --> 00:51:59,009
outcome, there is a purpose.

852
00:51:59,009 --> 00:52:02,586
MARISHA: You don't think we're just destroying
everything, everywhere we go?

853
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:09,897
LAURA: No! Are you kidding? We saved an entire
town today! More dragons may come, but for the

854
00:52:09,897 --> 00:52:18,073
time being, people are safe, and we are safe. If
we are successful, we could save this entire

855
00:52:18,073 --> 00:52:20,225
fucking world.

856
00:52:20,225 --> 00:52:23,858
MARISHA: (laughs) I don't know if I'm cut out to
be a hero.

857
00:52:23,858 --> 00:52:25,714
LAURA: You already are.

858
00:52:25,714 --> 00:52:29,290
MARISHA: (groans) I don't know about that.

859
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:38,663
LAURA: Anyway. Be happy. Go to him. Just live in
the moment, don't worry about it right now.

860
00:52:38,663 --> 00:52:51,306
MARISHA: Maybe there's another time and another
place where we don't have to. But now I feel like we do.

861
00:52:51,306 --> 00:52:56,187
LAURA: We're in a mansion right now. Fucking
cannonball! And I get up and I cannonball.

862
00:52:56,187 --> 00:52:59,524
MATT: Big splash. Hot water across your face--

863
00:52:59,524 --> 00:53:01,285
TRAVIS: Four and a half!

864
00:53:01,285 --> 00:53:04,179
LAURA: All right. I need a higher-- I need a
broom!

865
00:53:04,179 --> 00:53:08,787
MATT: Servants come by and fill your goblets that
they brought you, with wine, because, drinking in

866
00:53:08,787 --> 00:53:10,558
hot tubs, what could possibly go wrong?

867
00:53:10,558 --> 00:53:12,343
LIAM: Did you just cannonball away?

868
00:53:12,343 --> 00:53:14,570
LAURA: I did.

869
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:16,793
LIAM: We all do it, we all do it.

870
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:18,792
ASHLEY: Should we have a cannonball contest?

871
00:53:18,792 --> 00:53:28,190
MARISHA: I cast Breathing Underwater on myself and
I just sink to the bottom of the pool and I just

872
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:33,386
stay there for a really long time at the bottom of
the pool.

873
00:53:33,386 --> 00:53:37,747
MATT: Do you have Water Breathing prepared? Or was
this your Alter Self gills?

874
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:42,388
MARISHA: Alter Self! Yeah, totally! Gills. I can
do that.

875
00:53:42,388 --> 00:53:46,169
MATT: So the sides of Keyleth's throat just sprout
gills suddenly and naturally and she sinks

876
00:53:46,169 --> 00:53:47,529
underneath

877
00:53:47,529 --> 00:53:54,210
TRAVIS: (shouting) Keyleth! No! No! And I run over
and pick her up off the bottom, which is

878
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:55,897
essentially suffocating her, right?

879
00:53:55,897 --> 00:53:57,544
MATT: Grog pulls you out of the water and shakes
you abruptly

880
00:53:57,544 --> 00:54:00,471
MARISHA: Wha--! Ow!

881
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:02,988
TRAVIS: Gills, sorry. And I shove her back in the
water.

882
00:54:02,988 --> 00:54:04,415
(laughter)

883
00:54:04,415 --> 00:54:05,619
MATT: Back under.

884
00:54:05,619 --> 00:54:06,910
MARISHA: And I just let myself sink again

885
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,019
(laughter)

886
00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:12,029
LIAM: On a side note, I have an earring as well
and I heard everyone go down into the hot springs

887
00:54:12,029 --> 00:54:15,761
so I went back to the kitchen and got some of that
chicken sorbet that they make here.

888
00:54:15,761 --> 00:54:17,400
MATT: It's delicious.

889
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,493
LIAM: And I went back to my sister's room and I
pulled the blanket down and I just smeared it all

890
00:54:21,493 --> 00:54:25,797
along the inside of the bed. And then I bring up
the blanket and tuck it in nice. It looks

891
00:54:25,797 --> 00:54:26,743
perfect.

892
00:54:26,743 --> 00:54:29,182
MATT: The ten servants watch the whole thing and
just nod, well done.

893
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,607
LAURA: That's disgusting!

894
00:54:30,607 --> 00:54:32,217
SAM: They had their orders.

895
00:54:32,217 --> 00:54:34,551
TALIESIN: You are the worst of us.

896
00:54:34,551 --> 00:54:36,039
LIAM: Goodnight boy-girls.

897
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:39,706
SAM: (husky voice) Goodnight.

898
00:54:39,706 --> 00:54:45,177
TRAVIS: Wait, is Percy in the water?

899
00:54:45,177 --> 00:54:47,010
MATT: Yeah, Percy's in the water with you guys.

900
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:48,359
ASHLEY: You got in? No, he went into the corner?

901
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:49,451
TRAVIS: Did you do a cannonball?

902
00:54:49,451 --> 00:54:51,130
TALIESIN: No, I do not cannonball.

903
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:52,981
LAURA: Cannonball, Percy!

904
00:54:52,981 --> 00:54:54,241
TALIESIN: I do not cannonball!

905
00:54:54,241 --> 00:54:55,656
TRAVIS: Percy!

906
00:54:55,656 --> 00:54:58,827
TALIESIN: I can't wear my glasses, I'm going to
hit something and I'm just going to bleed everywhere

907
00:54:58,827 --> 00:55:00,910
ASHLEY: A cannonball contest?

908
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:02,367
SAM: You want to do a cannonball contest?

909
00:55:02,367 --> 00:55:03,525
ASHLEY: Let's do a cannonball contest.

910
00:55:03,525 --> 00:55:06,098
TALIESIN: Fine. If there's a dare involved, that's
completely different.

911
00:55:06,098 --> 00:55:08,143
ASHLEY: How much money should we put on it?

912
00:55:08,143 --> 00:55:10,130
SAM: 15,000 gold.

913
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:12,822
(laughter)

914
00:55:12,822 --> 00:55:14,571
LAURA: How about five pounds of gems?

915
00:55:14,571 --> 00:55:17,127
SAM: Sure. Do we all have that?

916
00:55:17,127 --> 00:55:19,075
LAURA: No, but I have it and I'll put it in the
middle.

917
00:55:19,075 --> 00:55:21,043
SAM: All right. Five pounds of gems.

918
00:55:21,043 --> 00:55:22,470
MATT: Five pounds of gems.

919
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:25,173
SAM: I haven't been here, but I wander in eating
some chicken with no pants.

920
00:55:25,173 --> 00:55:28,194
(laughter)

921
00:55:28,194 --> 00:55:30,523
MATT: You just got Donald Ducked, guys!

922
00:55:30,523 --> 00:55:35,492
LAURA: Scanlan! Oh Scanlan! Your painting! Your
painting is not accurate, Scanlan!

923
00:55:35,492 --> 00:55:42,603
SAM: Oh. No, of course not. It's artistic licence.
Come on.

924
00:55:42,603 --> 00:55:44,267
(laughter)

925
00:55:44,267 --> 00:55:47,258
TALIESIN: Did they run out of paint, is that what
happened?

926
00:55:47,258 --> 00:55:55,968
SAM: All right, the rules: Everyone gets one jump
to be officiated by--? Who? Sarenrae?

927
00:55:55,968 --> 00:55:58,187
LAURA: Somebody has to-- by your servants.

928
00:55:58,187 --> 00:55:59,890
SAM: They'll vote for me.

929
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:02,057
(laughter)

930
00:56:02,057 --> 00:56:03,652
MARISHA: Wait! What are we doing? We're doing a
cannonball contest?

931
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:08,553
MARISHA: Oh, I'll join this. I swim back up to the
top to join.

932
00:56:08,553 --> 00:56:14,222
SAM: Can you officiate? Are you going to join or
are you in too much of a funk to?

933
00:56:14,222 --> 00:56:15,892
ASHLEY: Grog can officiate.

934
00:56:15,892 --> 00:56:20,058
Be fair.

935
00:56:20,058 --> 00:56:21,389
TRAVIS: I will!

936
00:56:21,389 --> 00:56:22,961
ASHLEY: But vote for me.

937
00:56:22,961 --> 00:56:24,391
TRAVIS: Okay.

938
00:56:24,391 --> 00:56:26,409
LAURA: Who's up first?

939
00:56:26,409 --> 00:56:28,051
MATT: Who's going first?

940
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:31,585
SAM: Alphabetical order.

941
00:56:31,585 --> 00:56:32,991
ASHLEY: Keyleth!

942
00:56:32,991 --> 00:56:36,080
MARISHA: Oh sure.

943
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:41,083
MATT: So, Keyleth. You go ahead and swim up, take
some time back, rush forward, leap. Make an--

944
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:42,607
MARISHA: We've had a short rest, right?

945
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:43,861
MATT: Correct.

946
00:56:43,861 --> 00:56:46,641
MARISHA: Okay. Acrobatics check?

947
00:56:46,641 --> 00:56:48,584
MATT: No, this is an athletics check.

948
00:56:48,584 --> 00:56:52,478
This is a jump, leap and--

949
00:56:52,478 --> 00:56:55,398
MARISHA: Not bad. 19.

950
00:56:55,398 --> 00:56:57,019
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

951
00:56:57,019 --> 00:56:59,725
MATT: She jumps into the air, seemingly
weightless--

952
00:56:59,725 --> 00:57:03,131
MARISHA: And in midair, I use my bonus action to
turn into an earth elemental!

953
00:57:03,131 --> 00:57:09,203
MATT: Turns into an almost literal cannonball,
displaces enough water to the point where the

954
00:57:09,203 --> 00:57:12,348
actual water level in the hot spring, now, is
about two inches lower than it was before--

955
00:57:12,348 --> 00:57:14,605
TALIESIN: I'm going upstairs to get a bottle of
raw sodium.

956
00:57:14,605 --> 00:57:18,263
(laughter)

957
00:57:18,263 --> 00:57:20,691
TALIESIN: It's on, motherfucker!

958
00:57:20,691 --> 00:57:24,680
MARISHA: I come out. Yeah!

959
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,036
ASHLEY: That was good, that was good, that was
good!

960
00:57:27,036 --> 00:57:31,089
TALIESIN: Actually, I send a servant. I tell them
what it is.

961
00:57:31,089 --> 00:57:34,859
MARISHA: Can we refill the pool after each use? Is
it magical enough to where we can refill the pool?

962
00:57:34,859 --> 00:57:36,370
SAM: Sure, there's a trickle--

963
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:41,709
ASHLEY: Hey, it's my turn! Do a little stretching.

964
00:57:41,709 --> 00:57:43,263
MATT: Do you have your gauntlets on or not?

965
00:57:43,263 --> 00:57:44,263
ASHLEY: Yeah.

966
00:57:44,263 --> 00:57:45,922
MATT: So you're just like--

967
00:57:45,922 --> 00:57:48,073
ASHLEY: Naked with gauntlets.

968
00:57:48,073 --> 00:57:49,558
MATT: You're not wearing anything?

969
00:57:49,558 --> 00:57:50,698
ASHLEY: Nope!

970
00:57:50,698 --> 00:57:54,545
SAM: But you can't see her naughty bits because
they glow with heavenly light.

971
00:57:54,545 --> 00:57:57,072
LIAM: Here come the artists!

972
00:57:57,072 --> 00:58:00,276
TRAVIS: The sound of 10,000 pens hitting paper.

973
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:06,512
MATT: So this strong, stout, powerful gnomish
female form steps out of the water with these

974
00:58:06,512 --> 00:58:12,859
large gauntlets with an ogre face across the back.
Looms up, gets a good distance, turns around,

975
00:58:12,859 --> 00:58:15,755
focuses, leaps. Make an athletics check.

976
00:58:15,755 --> 00:58:22,236
TRAVIS: Squash that! Ooh, snip diggity!

977
00:58:22,236 --> 00:58:24,378
LAURA: Oh shit!

978
00:58:24,378 --> 00:58:25,800
ASHLEY: 23?

979
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:32,532
MATT: Amazing as your earth elemental form was, it
displaced about the size an earth elemental would.

980
00:58:32,532 --> 00:58:39,333
Pike's much smaller form managed to displace about
as much as an earth elemental would. Water goes

981
00:58:39,333 --> 00:58:43,635
flying out, spraying you guys. The water itself
takes a while to actually calm down again--

982
00:58:43,635 --> 00:58:45,713
TRAVIS: I actually slip and fall backwards like--

983
00:58:45,713 --> 00:58:48,151
(laughter)

984
00:58:48,151 --> 00:58:50,202
TRAVIS: Whoa!

985
00:58:50,202 --> 00:58:52,500
ASHLEY: Whoa, that was a big one!

986
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,118
(laughter)

987
00:58:54,118 --> 00:58:56,043
MATT: Who's up next?

988
00:58:56,043 --> 00:58:57,051
LAURA: Percy.

989
00:58:57,051 --> 00:58:58,862
TALIESIN: I'm not done, I'm still working on
something.

990
00:58:58,862 --> 00:59:00,916
ASHLEY: Oh, wait, you should have gone before me.
I'm sorry.

991
00:59:00,916 --> 00:59:05,137
TALIESIN: I'm working on something, you go next.
I've got a pot and some cloth, and a whole thing--

992
00:59:05,137 --> 00:59:06,975
LAURA: Oh, I'm the only one that's left?

993
00:59:06,975 --> 00:59:11,349
SAM: No, I'm here too! L, M, N, P, Q, R, S. That's
me! Oh boy.

994
00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:15,932
ASHLEY: Sorry I jumped you, Percy-- He was gone,
that's why.

995
00:59:15,932 --> 00:59:21,223
SAM: I'm going to take a flying leap and jump in
while cannonballing.

996
00:59:21,223 --> 00:59:23,193
MATT: All right, athletics check.

997
00:59:23,193 --> 00:59:27,321
SAM: Sploosh. That's an 11.

998
00:59:27,321 --> 00:59:28,949
(laughter)

999
00:59:28,949 --> 00:59:32,486
SAM: And when I hit the water I set off a level
two Thunderwave.

1000
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:36,587
(laughter)

1001
00:59:36,587 --> 00:59:45,404
MATT: So Scanlan doesn't sprint but gingerly jogs
up to the side of the pool, leaps in the air. It

1002
00:59:45,404 --> 00:59:51,782
sends waves out from each side and drenches all of
you waiting on the side again--

1003
00:59:51,782 --> 00:59:54,825
(laughter)

1004
00:59:54,825 --> 01:00:00,444
MATT: As the water comes rushing back, slapping
into you, Scanlan, after the fact but,

1005
01:00:00,444 --> 01:00:02,086
nevertheless, a very impressive display.

1006
01:00:02,086 --> 01:00:03,693
SAM: Why, thank you. Take a bow, take a bow.

1007
01:00:03,693 --> 01:00:05,433
ASHLEY: Good job, good job.

1008
01:00:05,433 --> 01:00:08,085
SAM: Thank you, thank you. Percy, are you back
yet?

1009
01:00:08,085 --> 01:00:09,230
TALIESIN: I'm ready.

1010
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:09,980
MATT: All right.

1011
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,080
TALIESIN: I've got a kettle--

1012
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,191
(laughter)

1013
01:00:13,191 --> 01:00:20,824
TALIESIN: And what is essentially a giant
cheesecloth teabag of raw sodium in an oil holding base.

1014
01:00:20,824 --> 01:00:23,155
You are aware of what will happen when I
hit the water?

1015
01:00:23,155 --> 01:00:24,010
MATT: Yep.

1016
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:29,290
TALIESIN: Okay, cool. I grab the kettle. I put it
to my chest. I take a run, and I leap into--

1017
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:30,603
MARISHA: Isn't this is detrimental to your
health?!

1018
01:00:30,603 --> 01:00:35,912
PERCY: Yes, this is a terrible idea. Do not do
this. Do not do this. You will die. And I take a

1019
01:00:35,912 --> 01:00:39,395
run and jump head into the--

1020
01:00:39,395 --> 01:00:42,213
MARISHA: (shouting) Percy, no!

1021
01:00:42,213 --> 01:00:43,863
MATT: Make an athletics check.

1022
01:00:43,863 --> 01:00:48,058
TALIESIN: Not acrobatics? Athletics. 23

1023
01:00:48,058 --> 01:00:55,889
MATT: 23, okay. So, as you land and hit the water,
there's a momentary pause, a little (sploosh,

1024
01:00:55,889 --> 01:01:03,321
explosion sound). A secondary explosion that
sounds dulled and covered until it hits the air in

1025
01:01:03,321 --> 01:01:12,677
a loud cacophonous (explosion sound). Water and
smoke and pieces of metal go flying as the kettle

1026
01:01:12,677 --> 01:01:17,756
is destroyed. You, Percy, suffer--

1027
01:01:17,756 --> 01:01:21,596
TALIESIN: Should have mostly directed down but I'm
aware that some--

1028
01:01:21,596 --> 01:01:28,050
MATT: Yeah. 23 points of bludgeoning and piercing
damage from shrapnel and pieces of metal that have

1029
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:32,089
just scattered across your chest but nevertheless,
a very impressive display.

1030
01:01:32,089 --> 01:01:33,621
LIAM: For science!

1031
01:01:33,621 --> 01:01:38,028
ASHLEY: Total Party Kill cannonball!

1032
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:45,686
TRAVIS: I look down and pull out a small piece of
the kettle out of my pectoral and toss it away.

1033
01:01:45,686 --> 01:01:52,020
That was very impressive, all of you. I'm very
impressed. It seems that--

1034
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:53,283
SAM: The twins!

1035
01:01:53,283 --> 01:01:54,613
MATT: The twins haven't gone.

1036
01:01:54,613 --> 01:01:56,700
TRAVIS: Oh, oh! I'm so sorry.

1037
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,421
LAURA: It's all right, Grog.

1038
01:01:58,421 --> 01:02:00,218
TRAVIS: No, no. Get it. Go do it.

1039
01:02:00,218 --> 01:02:03,916
LAURA: All right. I take my broom.

1040
01:02:03,916 --> 01:02:05,688
LIAM: Here comes the bellyflop--

1041
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:13,501
LAURA: I know, right? I fly 20 feet up. As high as
the ceiling. How high is the ceiling?

1042
01:02:13,501 --> 01:02:16,079
SAM: Not that high.

1043
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:17,393
LAURA: I get to the top of the ceiling.

1044
01:02:17,393 --> 01:02:19,336
MATT: Okay, it's about 15, 20 feet up from the
water's surface.

1045
01:02:19,336 --> 01:02:22,815
LAURA: All right. I stand up on the broom.

1046
01:02:22,815 --> 01:02:26,896
MATT: Ceiling's right above you. You're
having to hunch forward a little bit.

1047
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:30,556
LAURA: And right as I cannonball off of the broom,
I release Trinket out of the necklace too so

1048
01:02:30,556 --> 01:02:32,597
(shouting) double cannonball!

1049
01:02:32,597 --> 01:02:35,220
MATT: As you leap off, make an athletics check.

1050
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:41,636
LAURA: 13!

1051
01:02:41,636 --> 01:02:43,496
MATT: Make an athletics check for Trinket.

1052
01:02:43,496 --> 01:02:53,821
LAURA: Oh, man. I thought that was going to be
good. Me and Trinket kind of suck. What

1053
01:02:53,821 --> 01:02:55,067
is that, strength?

1054
01:02:55,067 --> 01:02:55,952
MATT: Strength, yes.

1055
01:02:55,952 --> 01:02:56,822
LAURA: 16.

1056
01:02:56,822 --> 01:03:01,782
MATT: 16. As you hit the water, there's a (double
splooshing sound) as a bear is suddenly placed

1057
01:03:01,782 --> 01:03:06,145
magically into the water beneath you at the same
velocity, causing the water itself to splash

1058
01:03:06,145 --> 01:03:11,381
outward, in a large column, a spray that gently
comes down around the sides of the initial splash.

1059
01:03:11,381 --> 01:03:13,416
Impressive, a very impressive display.

1060
01:03:13,416 --> 01:03:16,670
SAM: Impressive. And she didn't really use magic,
so that's good. Bonus points there.

1061
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:19,315
MATT: Trinket eventually comes out of the water.
(growl, shaking coat sound) Shakes off.

1062
01:03:19,315 --> 01:03:25,117
LIAM: Is the judging of this up to artistic
interpretation, like ice skating?

1063
01:03:25,117 --> 01:03:26,786
SAM: That's up to Grog!

1064
01:03:26,786 --> 01:03:31,624
TRAVIS: Well done, all around. Really, I'm really
quite impressed. However, there was only one--

1065
01:03:31,624 --> 01:03:35,004
ASHLEY: Hang on. He still has to go.

1066
01:03:35,004 --> 01:03:36,599
LAURA: No, he's not in the room.

1067
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:38,298
ASHLEY: He's not in the room.

1068
01:03:38,359 --> 01:03:41,066
TRAVIS: Yeah, wait. Is Vax going to do it? Is he
coming down?

1069
01:03:41,066 --> 01:03:43,447
LAURA: Is he stealthing right now and he's
actually in the room?

1070
01:03:43,447 --> 01:03:45,362
SAM: I don't think so.

1071
01:03:45,362 --> 01:03:49,138
LIAM: (snoring)

1072
01:03:49,138 --> 01:03:57,319
TRAVIS: No, there was only one that managed to draw
blood with their display. Therefore, Percy is the

1073
01:03:57,319 --> 01:03:58,462
winner.

1074
01:03:58,462 --> 01:03:59,748
(applause)

1075
01:03:59,748 --> 01:04:03,007
SAM: Well met, well met. Five pounds of gems?

1076
01:04:03,007 --> 01:04:04,275
LAURA: Yeah.

1077
01:04:04,275 --> 01:04:07,485
LIAM: He needs it!

1078
01:04:07,485 --> 01:04:10,006
MATT: He takes it and smiles as the blood slowly
runs from one nostril--

1079
01:04:10,006 --> 01:04:11,391
(laughter)

1080
01:04:11,391 --> 01:04:12,461
ASHLEY: Oh man!

1081
01:04:12,461 --> 01:04:17,131
TALIESIN: Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to
sleep off this spa.

1082
01:04:17,131 --> 01:04:19,364
(laughter)

1083
01:04:19,364 --> 01:04:21,476
LIAM: Those gems are going to turn into lead,
aren't they?

1084
01:04:21,476 --> 01:04:24,143
TALIESIN: Got plans for one of them--

1085
01:04:24,143 --> 01:04:26,822
MATT: He takes the gems in one hand, takes the
towel, wraps it around as he steps out of the

1086
01:04:26,822 --> 01:04:28,861
water with the other and makes his way outside of
the spa.

1087
01:04:28,861 --> 01:04:32,675
TALIESIN: Leaving a little trail of blood all the
way down the corridor.

1088
01:04:32,675 --> 01:04:34,185
(laughter)

1089
01:04:34,185 --> 01:04:35,984
SAM: Good game, good game.

1090
01:04:35,984 --> 01:04:39,555
MATT: All righty.

1091
01:04:39,555 --> 01:04:41,820
TRAVIS: Well, I'm going to bed.

1092
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,120
LAURA: All right, all right.

1093
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:47,141
MATT: All right. You guys go, find your way to
your respective rooms, rest for the remainder of

1094
01:04:47,141 --> 01:04:52,127
the evening. Wake up to the smell of wonderfully
cooked chicken wafting through the hallways of

1095
01:04:52,127 --> 01:04:59,933
the mansion. The only person that has a unique
evening's sleeping is Vex, who slides into her

1096
01:04:59,933 --> 01:05:07,406
comfortable, silk sheet bed to a (sucking sound)
to find some sort of now chilled but loosely

1097
01:05:07,406 --> 01:05:09,725
room-temperature chicken paste--

1098
01:05:09,725 --> 01:05:11,678
LAURA: That is just disgusting.

1099
01:05:11,678 --> 01:05:14,685
TALIESIN: Don't you mean, that's fowl?

1100
01:05:14,685 --> 01:05:16,953
(groaning)

1101
01:05:16,953 --> 01:05:18,719
TRAVIS: Oh! Fowl!

1102
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:20,542
LAURA: I don't even care. Trinket loves it.

1103
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:24,581
MATT: And Trinket is all over that. Trinket is now
just lapping it up from the inside of the bed--

1104
01:05:24,581 --> 01:05:27,490
LAURA: Yeah. I just go to sleep and I'll take a
shower in the morning.

1105
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:33,813
MATT: Okay. All right. You all wake up. Breakfast
is at your disposal. You begin to eat comfortably,

1106
01:05:33,813 --> 01:05:37,119
you wash up, Vex--

1107
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:38,329
LAURA: A lot.

1108
01:05:38,329 --> 01:05:41,235
MATT: Is there anything else you wish to achieve
here or shall we continue with the rest of your

1109
01:05:41,235 --> 01:05:42,251
journey?

1110
01:05:42,251 --> 01:05:47,548
SAM: Well, we just have a few things to divvy up.
I've learned about the book that we found from the

1111
01:05:47,548 --> 01:05:55,638
dragon. It is filled with knowledge that can
increase someone's abilities.

1112
01:05:55,638 --> 01:05:57,807
LAURA: What abilities?

1113
01:05:57,807 --> 01:06:02,201
SAM: The abilities that I happen to be very good
at would be even better.

1114
01:06:02,201 --> 01:06:03,532
LAURA: Hmm.

1115
01:06:03,532 --> 01:06:05,663
MARISHA: I don't want any part of that.

1116
01:06:05,663 --> 01:06:08,861
SAM: It's not my sex abilities.

1117
01:06:08,861 --> 01:06:11,500
MARISHA: Oh, oh. Okay.

1118
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:14,693
SAM: Actually, technically yes. Technically, yes.
My sex ability--

1119
01:06:14,693 --> 01:06:16,457
LAURA: What abilities? (laughs)

1120
01:06:16,457 --> 01:06:17,917
SAM: Charismatic abilities.

1121
01:06:17,917 --> 01:06:19,053
LAURA: Oh?

1122
01:06:19,053 --> 01:06:21,987
ASHLEY: Oh, it just gives you, you have all the
charisma?

1123
01:06:21,987 --> 01:06:23,788
SAM: Permanently better charisma.

1124
01:06:23,788 --> 01:06:31,244
LAURA: Well, Keyleth, as you make that awkward-ass
face, maybe you should improve your charisma.

1125
01:06:31,244 --> 01:06:33,346
LIAM: You smell like chicken.

1126
01:06:33,346 --> 01:06:36,337
LAURA: Yeah, somebody put chicken paste in my bed.
I don't know who it could be.

1127
01:06:36,337 --> 01:06:38,094
LIAM: Yeah, we've got to get out of this mansion.

1128
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:39,662
LAURA: Yeah. Weird.

1129
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:45,264
TRAVIS: Well, I also went to my room and I was
like "Man, what I could really--" and I was

1130
01:06:45,264 --> 01:06:48,665
holding the jug, at the time, and I was like, "I'm
just going to break it, nobody'll know--"

1131
01:06:48,665 --> 01:06:50,087
SAM: Oh shit!

1132
01:06:50,087 --> 01:06:54,353
TRAVIS: It'll be great. And I was like, "I could
really go for some <i>beer</i> right now," and all of a

1133
01:06:54,353 --> 01:06:58,614
sudden, the jug was full of shitloads of beer.

1134
01:06:58,614 --> 01:07:00,221
LAURA: What?!

1135
01:07:00,221 --> 01:07:01,111
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1136
01:07:01,111 --> 01:07:02,625
SAM: Is it a never-ending beer jug?

1137
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:06,564
TRAVIS: Oh no, it's not never-ending. It stopped
after a bit. But I got plenty fucking wasted.

1138
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:07,986
LAURA: Is it just beer?

1139
01:07:07,986 --> 01:07:10,642
SAM: Is it just beer? Or is it any spirit? Or
what?

1140
01:07:10,642 --> 01:07:14,127
TRAVIS: No, I said "mayonnaise" and it started to
make mayonnaise and then it stopped so I think

1141
01:07:14,127 --> 01:07:16,853
there's a finite amount of stuff it can make in a
day.

1142
01:07:16,853 --> 01:07:20,025
(disconcerted oohs)

1143
01:07:20,025 --> 01:07:22,353
LAURA: Do you have a jug of mayonnaise now?

1144
01:07:22,353 --> 01:07:24,052
TRAVIS: No, I ate that too.

1145
01:07:24,052 --> 01:07:36,009
(laughter)

1146
01:07:36,009 --> 01:07:38,060
MATT: In the wee hours of the morning--

1147
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:39,529
TALIESIN: There's chicken!

1148
01:07:39,529 --> 01:07:42,710
LIAM: That was one of the best exchanges of our
entire run!

1149
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:48,406
ASHLEY: Oh my God.

1150
01:07:48,406 --> 01:07:50,361
TALIESIN: Wow!

1151
01:07:50,361 --> 01:07:52,493
MATT: So--

1152
01:07:52,493 --> 01:07:55,036
LAURA: Gross!

1153
01:07:55,036 --> 01:08:00,021
ASHLEY: I can't stop laughing.

1154
01:08:00,021 --> 01:08:04,033
LIAM: Oh my goodness.

1155
01:08:04,033 --> 01:08:05,534
MATT: So, what else?

1156
01:08:05,534 --> 01:08:09,090
(laughter)

1157
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:11,744
SAM: Okay, now you're going to get a bunch of
mayonnaise shipped to our PO box.

1158
01:08:11,744 --> 01:08:14,070
(laughter)

1159
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:15,907
LAURA: No mayonnaise!

1160
01:08:15,907 --> 01:08:20,049
LIAM: Beer. Send beer, is fine.

1161
01:08:20,049 --> 01:08:23,276
MARISHA: Oh, that one brought tears.

1162
01:08:23,276 --> 01:08:27,805
ASHLEY: Please somebody draw him just sad in his
room eating mayonnaise--

1163
01:08:27,805 --> 01:08:30,953
MATT: Scooping mayonnaise out of a jar.

1164
01:08:30,953 --> 01:08:34,270
TALIESIN: A Grecian urn of mayonnaise.

1165
01:08:34,270 --> 01:08:36,394
ASHLEY: Oh, my tears.

1166
01:08:36,394 --> 01:08:38,234
MATT: Saddest Winnie the Pooh ever--

1167
01:08:38,234 --> 01:08:43,673
SAM: I also found out that that one of the vials
is a potion vial. It can temporarily give the

1168
01:08:43,673 --> 01:08:52,358
drinker a spell of Etherealness. Which is like you
temporarily turn into Casper the Friendly Ghost.

1169
01:08:52,358 --> 01:08:53,872
You can pass through walls.

1170
01:08:53,872 --> 01:08:54,928
LAURA: Oh cool!

1171
01:08:54,928 --> 01:08:57,150
SAM: Anyone who drinks it.

1172
01:08:57,150 --> 01:08:58,069
MARISHA: Vax?

1173
01:08:58,069 --> 01:09:00,591
LAURA: Oh, that would be good for you.

1174
01:09:00,591 --> 01:09:02,689
MATT: Well, less drinking. More like applying.

1175
01:09:02,689 --> 01:09:03,632
SAM: Oh, it's rubbing?

1176
01:09:03,632 --> 01:09:04,637
MATT: Yeah, it's an oil.

1177
01:09:04,637 --> 01:09:05,609
LAURA: Oh, don't drink it.

1178
01:09:05,609 --> 01:09:06,041
MATT: I would not recommend drinking it.

1179
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:07,430
SAM: I can rub it on your back for you.

1180
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:08,980
MARISHA: Yeah, you have to rub it on you.

1181
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:11,468
LIAM: I'm all right with that.

1182
01:09:11,468 --> 01:09:12,628
(laughter)

1183
01:09:12,628 --> 01:09:14,645
TALIESIN: You'd need to use a stepping stool to do
it, but you could.

1184
01:09:14,645 --> 01:09:17,086
LAURA: The other one was a Potion of Climbing,
which we decided--

1185
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:19,929
MARISHA: Does Pike want it? Oh, you?

1186
01:09:19,929 --> 01:09:21,139
SAM: No, it's Vex.

1187
01:09:21,139 --> 01:09:22,918
LAURA: I suck at it, but anybody else can have
it.

1188
01:09:22,918 --> 01:09:25,850
TRAVIS: Don't you have a broom? You ain't going to
be climbing much.

1189
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:27,395
LAURA: That's true! I don't need it. I have a
broom!

1190
01:09:27,395 --> 01:09:31,965
TALIESIN: Actually, I might take it. High ground
is occasionally very useful for me.

1191
01:09:31,965 --> 01:09:34,065
LAURA: I've got a broom that flies.

1192
01:09:34,065 --> 01:09:35,790
TALIESIN: And I'm not that strong.

1193
01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:39,141
MARISHA: What was the name of that tome again,
Scanlan?

1194
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:46,652
SAM: Tome of Leadership and Influence. I'm torn,
Keyleth. You have some charisma issues, shall we say?

1195
01:09:46,652 --> 01:09:51,179
MARISHA: Uh-huh. No, keep telling me about myself,
Scanlan, today.

1196
01:09:51,179 --> 01:09:59,321
SAM: Well, I'm just saying that I am quite
self-confident, sure of myself. Some would say

1197
01:09:59,321 --> 01:10:00,600
charming.

1198
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,294
LAURA: Some. Not most.

1199
01:10:02,294 --> 01:10:05,295
SAM: And this book would make me unstoppably so--

1200
01:10:05,295 --> 01:10:07,011
MARISHA: Sure.

1201
01:10:07,011 --> 01:10:16,759
SAM: So, I don't know, we could roshambo for it?
What does the group think?

1202
01:10:16,759 --> 01:10:20,165
LIAM: I think Keyleth should read it. She's trying
to lead her people.

1203
01:10:20,165 --> 01:10:22,372
TRAVIS: Yeah. Roshambo for it.

1204
01:10:22,372 --> 01:10:35,394
MARISHA: I don't want to-- what? I don't like
wanting things. I don't care, you--

1205
01:10:35,394 --> 01:10:41,930
LAURA: Who has-- This is-- who has charisma-based
spells?

1206
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:43,584
SAM: Me?

1207
01:10:43,584 --> 01:10:45,047
MATT: You.

1208
01:10:49,331 --> 01:10:51,350
LIAM: That's a big fat pause, is what that is.

1209
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:52,811
MATT: Yeah.

1210
01:10:52,811 --> 01:10:54,118
SAM: Why don't we think on it?

1211
01:10:54,118 --> 01:10:55,125
MARISHA: All right, we'll think on it.

1212
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:57,316
TALIESIN: To be fair, it takes days.

1213
01:10:57,316 --> 01:11:00,107
SAM: It takes six days of reading to take effect.

1214
01:11:00,107 --> 01:11:02,479
LAURA: Oh shit. So if you read for two days and
then pass it off to someone else, does it just

1215
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:03,571
restart?

1216
01:11:03,571 --> 01:11:04,666
MARISHA: No.

1217
01:11:04,666 --> 01:11:06,567
TALIESIN: It's once a century it works.

1218
01:11:06,567 --> 01:11:09,899
TRAVIS: Oh shit! Once a century?

1219
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:11,581
TALIESIN: I have a similar book, that I used--

1220
01:11:11,581 --> 01:11:13,398
LAURA: What did you use it on?

1221
01:11:13,398 --> 01:11:15,743
SAM: Yeah, you live for many centuries, Keyleth.
You can have it nexties!

1222
01:11:15,743 --> 01:11:17,672
(laughter)

1223
01:11:17,672 --> 01:11:19,406
TALIESIN: That's actually a very fair point.

1224
01:11:19,406 --> 01:11:21,173
TRAVIS: That's kind of perfect.

1225
01:11:21,173 --> 01:11:26,582
TALIESIN: I was about to say, would you like a
Manual of Quickness? Here, for you--

1226
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:28,755
(laughter)

1227
01:11:28,755 --> 01:11:31,486
MARISHA: Oh, for the next century?

1228
01:11:31,486 --> 01:11:33,274
TALIESIN: So 99 years from now--

1229
01:11:33,274 --> 01:11:35,449
MARISHA: Sure, I'll hold onto it for that long.

1230
01:11:35,449 --> 01:11:37,440
TRAVIS: When we're all cold and dead!

1231
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,623
TALIESIN: I was holding onto it in the hopes of
finding somebody long-lived to sell it to.

1232
01:11:39,623 --> 01:11:48,207
SAM: Speaking of old, are some of us older than we
used to be?

1233
01:11:48,207 --> 01:11:49,860
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1234
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:52,043
MARISHA: Are we still old? It would have worn off,
right?

1235
01:11:52,043 --> 01:11:55,424
MATT: I would say, for the purposes of the travel,
because you guys had a few days' travel from the

1236
01:11:55,424 --> 01:12:00,331
actual Sphinx's lair, towards Westruun when you
were travellng back, you had the opportunity to

1237
01:12:00,331 --> 01:12:04,684
use Greater Restoration to get rid of it.

1238
01:12:04,684 --> 01:12:06,122
MARISHA: Between Pike and I--

1239
01:12:06,122 --> 01:12:07,421
MATT: Yeah, in that time.

1240
01:12:07,421 --> 01:12:09,432
SAM: What if we don't want to be any younger?

1241
01:12:09,432 --> 01:12:12,497
MATT: Then you could have said no and kept it as
you go. If you wanted to take in your nice salt

1242
01:12:12,497 --> 01:12:13,635
and pepper--

1243
01:12:13,635 --> 01:12:15,025
LAURA: How old are you now, Scanlan, if you keep
it?

1244
01:12:15,025 --> 01:12:16,442
SAM: I don't know.

1245
01:12:16,442 --> 01:12:17,712
ASHLEY: That salt and pepper hair?

1246
01:12:17,712 --> 01:12:19,108
SAM: A girl never tells her age.

1247
01:12:19,108 --> 01:12:23,350
MATT: Would you want to maintain your little
creeping Reed Richards going on at the sides there?

1248
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:25,267
SAM: No, I'll get young again.

1249
01:12:25,267 --> 01:12:27,456
MATT: Slightly.

1250
01:12:27,456 --> 01:12:28,355
SAM: Slightly.

1251
01:12:28,355 --> 01:12:30,639
MARISHA: He said, begrudgingly.

1252
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:31,764
MATT: I know.

1253
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:35,207
LIAM: Set that dial back to 39.

1254
01:12:35,207 --> 01:12:39,865
MATT: All right then. Anything else?

1255
01:12:39,865 --> 01:12:41,303
MARISHA: What were you going to say, Percy?

1256
01:12:41,303 --> 01:12:45,441
TALIESIN: I was thinking, perhaps, you're not
necessarily the person to magically augment your path.

1257
01:12:45,441 --> 01:12:49,812
MARISHA: That's kind of my hesitance about it, I
guess.

1258
01:12:49,812 --> 01:12:53,003
TALIESIN: I had meditated upon the idea for a
minute.

1259
01:12:53,003 --> 01:12:59,399
MARISHA: I'm honestly kind of afraid of what kind
of leadership things and influence it could

1260
01:12:59,399 --> 01:13:05,659
possibly tell me. I don't know. I don't know. I
don't know.

1261
01:13:05,659 --> 01:13:07,389
TALIESIN: (laughs)

1262
01:13:07,389 --> 01:13:08,806
SAM: I do!

1263
01:13:08,806 --> 01:13:11,157
MARISHA: You can read it, Scanlan.

1264
01:13:11,157 --> 01:13:12,095
SAM: Yes!

1265
01:13:12,095 --> 01:13:13,713
(laughter)

1266
01:13:13,713 --> 01:13:15,942
TALIESIN: At the very least, it'll keep him busy
for four or five days.

1267
01:13:15,942 --> 01:13:17,209
MARISHA: That's true.

1268
01:13:17,209 --> 01:13:18,719
ASHLEY: That's true. That's true.

1269
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:21,426
TALIESIN: Because you have to read for 48 hours--

1270
01:13:21,426 --> 01:13:26,687
LAURA: What if he gets even more charismatic and
then he proposes again? And he charms you more?

1271
01:13:26,687 --> 01:13:30,678
ASHLEY: Well, if he's so charming, I just wouldn't
be able to help it.

1272
01:13:30,678 --> 01:13:31,975
LAURA: It's possible.

1273
01:13:31,975 --> 01:13:36,456
MARISHA: I know, that's my-- actually, my only
other regret is do we want to turn Scanlan into a

1274
01:13:36,456 --> 01:13:40,590
charm nuclear weapon? Because that's what we'll be
doing.

1275
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:45,411
LAURA: I kind of do want to do that. He is super
good at talking to people.

1276
01:13:45,411 --> 01:13:46,575
MARISHA: He is.

1277
01:13:46,575 --> 01:13:49,478
TALIESIN: And I think there's enough of us that we
could all keep each other in check, from--

1278
01:13:49,478 --> 01:13:57,734
LIAM: Between Grog and Scanlan, we can solve any
problem, I think, so beef him up, so to speak.

1279
01:13:57,734 --> 01:14:02,490
MARISHA: Tell me what kind of leadership things--
who wrote that, Scanlan?

1280
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:04,327
SAM: Lao Tsu.

1281
01:14:04,327 --> 01:14:11,338
MARISHA: Tell me what kind of leadership skills Lao
Tsu wants to bestow upon you. If there's any good

1282
01:14:11,338 --> 01:14:12,576
ones, pass them along.

1283
01:14:12,576 --> 01:14:13,819
SAM: All right, I'll give you some tips.

1284
01:14:13,819 --> 01:14:14,762
MARISHA: All right.

1285
01:14:14,762 --> 01:14:18,881
MATT: (laughs) All right. You guys finish your
breakfast, make your way outside of the mansion, back

1286
01:14:18,881 --> 01:14:24,384
into the dragon's den. Is there anything else you
wish to do before you leave? As you can only take

1287
01:14:24,384 --> 01:14:27,959
the amount of gold that you retrieved, and the
items you could farm, the rest will have to be left

1288
01:14:27,959 --> 01:14:32,396
behind, hopefully to be retrieved at some point down
the line by either the remnants of Westruun or

1289
01:14:32,396 --> 01:14:34,023
yourselves.

1290
01:14:34,023 --> 01:14:37,828
LIAM: I'll just say that I've attuned to all my
old shit while everyone was swimming.

1291
01:14:37,828 --> 01:14:40,621
MATT: Okay. Cool.

1292
01:14:40,621 --> 01:14:46,477
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. I carved a pretty little heart
on the side of one of the boots just to make it

1293
01:14:46,477 --> 01:14:48,602
extra girly.

1294
01:14:48,602 --> 01:14:49,938
MATT: Make a perception check.

1295
01:14:49,938 --> 01:14:54,560
LIAM: I would just think that meant you love me.

1296
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,755
LAURA: Maybe I do.

1297
01:14:57,755 --> 01:15:00,398
LIAM: Uh, that is a 39.

1298
01:15:00,398 --> 01:15:03,274
LAURA: (laughs) What?!

1299
01:15:03,274 --> 01:15:12,049
LIAM: 17 plus perception is-- did I get it wrong?
Am I too tired? I've had a long day, people. Let's

1300
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:13,520
say 29.

1301
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,695
MATT: Did you take perception as one of your--

1302
01:15:15,695 --> 01:15:16,826
LIAM: Yeah.

1303
01:15:16,826 --> 01:15:20,850
MATT: Oh, then yeah. Okay. You take the boots and
you put them on and immediately, there's a heart

1304
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:23,582
there. And you're like (pained) hmm. That probably
means she loves me.

1305
01:15:23,582 --> 01:15:25,182
LIAM: No, I like it. It's fine!

1306
01:15:25,182 --> 01:15:27,114
MATT: Yeah. At first you're like, sh-- oh no, it's
cool.

1307
01:15:27,114 --> 01:15:29,724
LIAM: I don't know what you're thinking. It's
beautiful.

1308
01:15:29,724 --> 01:15:31,576
MATT: All right, you guys are back in the dragon's
lair. Is there anything else you wish to do?

1309
01:15:31,576 --> 01:15:35,478
TALIESIN: We're going to make sure we walk around
the trap that is still active in the front--

1310
01:15:35,478 --> 01:15:36,711
TRAVIS: Right.

1311
01:15:36,711 --> 01:15:38,881
MATT: Make your way back through the tunnel that
you had carved before--

1312
01:15:38,881 --> 01:15:40,480
LIAM: Have to avoid that old magic.

1313
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,948
TRAVIS: Is there any lasting damage from the acid
burns?

1314
01:15:42,948 --> 01:15:49,154
MATT: Thankfully, through magic healing and other
means there was no scarring. The tattoos and beard

1315
01:15:49,154 --> 01:15:50,511
that were partially destroyed--

1316
01:15:50,511 --> 01:15:52,097
TRAVIS: I was going to ask: beard?

1317
01:15:52,097 --> 01:15:55,376
MATT: Yeah, the beard's a little bit reduced from
the sheer volume of acid that was thrown at your

1318
01:15:55,376 --> 01:15:58,659
face but since healing magic was applied shortly
thereafter, the little bit of the beard that began

1319
01:15:58,659 --> 01:16:02,685
to singe, it stopped that process. So you still
have some facial hair, just may have to grow back

1320
01:16:02,685 --> 01:16:03,991
to its full majesty--

1321
01:16:03,991 --> 01:16:05,823
TRAVIS: I may need a haircut in a day or two.

1322
01:16:05,823 --> 01:16:11,479
TALIESIN: Ooh. Can you Stone Shape something for
me?

1323
01:16:11,479 --> 01:16:21,738
I would like to have Keyleth Stone Shape
and use one dragon scale, if you would be so kind.

1324
01:16:21,738 --> 01:16:24,085
Or, actually, one tooth if that would be all
right.

1325
01:16:24,085 --> 01:16:25,699
MARISHA: Sure. Tooth me.

1326
01:16:25,699 --> 01:16:32,673
TALIESIN: I would like to leave the "VM" seal on
the side of the cavern.

1327
01:16:32,673 --> 01:16:34,132
LAURA: (gasps)

1328
01:16:34,132 --> 01:16:39,997
TALIESIN: And just written in-- what would a
dragon understand?

1329
01:16:39,997 --> 01:16:41,569
MATT: Draconic.

1330
01:16:41,569 --> 01:16:42,482
TALIESIN: Draconic?

1331
01:16:42,482 --> 01:16:43,887
LIAM: We have somebody who can do that--

1332
01:16:43,887 --> 01:16:46,469
TALIESIN: "One down" and let's embed the tooth
into the rock.

1333
01:16:46,469 --> 01:16:48,600
SAM: Ooh.

1334
01:16:48,682 --> 01:16:51,647
TRAVIS: Yes! I like it.

1335
01:16:51,647 --> 01:16:52,867
TALIESIN: We might as well.

1336
01:16:52,867 --> 01:16:54,077
LAURA: I like it. I like it.

1337
01:16:54,077 --> 01:16:56,217
MARISHA: So I do the Vox Machina crest.

1338
01:16:56,217 --> 01:16:58,859
MATT: Okay.

1339
01:16:58,859 --> 01:17:03,239
MARISHA: And then "one down." Who speaks
Draconic?

1340
01:17:03,239 --> 01:17:06,370
MATT: All right, so you get with her. You scribble
onto the ground what that phrase would look like.

1341
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:12,031
You go ahead and copy that and you embed it
permanently and immediately into the side of the stone.

1342
01:17:12,031 --> 01:17:14,161
LIAM: And I said, bitch!

1343
01:17:14,161 --> 01:17:22,597
MATT: All righty. You guys make your way down
Gatshadow, through the Bramblewood Forest to

1344
01:17:22,597 --> 01:17:30,923
Westruun itself. As you hit the base of the
mountain, start getting towards the edge of the

1345
01:17:30,923 --> 01:17:34,492
forest, you see a pillar of smoke rising up from
that direction--

1346
01:17:34,492 --> 01:17:36,295
MARISHA: From Westruun?

1347
01:17:36,295 --> 01:17:38,700
MATT: A relatively thick pillar of smoke, a few
actually.

1348
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:39,915
LAURA: Oh no!

1349
01:17:39,915 --> 01:17:41,093
MARISHA: Wait. What?

1350
01:17:41,093 --> 01:17:42,628
SAM: Uh-oh. They've already attacked.

1351
01:17:42,628 --> 01:17:45,996
TRAVIS: No, we go fast. We go.

1352
01:17:45,996 --> 01:17:51,480
MATT: All right. You guys rush through the
remainder of the Bramblewood, come out into the

1353
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:57,196
field and are met by what looks like a series of
fires that are out in the open field, north of

1354
01:17:57,196 --> 01:18:06,864
Westruun, not within the actual city. You see these
are pyres. The dead of the Umbrasyl battle have

1355
01:18:06,864 --> 01:18:13,244
been set aflame, being given off the proper heroes'
sending. It is a standard after-battle remembrance

1356
01:18:13,244 --> 01:18:18,642
of those who fell for the herd. You see standing
amongst them the twelve surviving members of the

1357
01:18:18,642 --> 01:18:26,236
battle, many of them pretty badly scarred from the
encounter but alive, nonetheless. Bandaged and

1358
01:18:26,236 --> 01:18:34,692
kind of taking a moment of silence. You do see of
that group, as well, Zanror and Worra are there.

1359
01:18:34,692 --> 01:18:40,306
They haven't noticed you yet. And standing behind
them all, one large aimless stone golem with a big

1360
01:18:40,306 --> 01:18:44,168
chain hanging out of its chest, just standing
there.

1361
01:18:44,168 --> 01:18:45,834
MARISHA: Fassbender!

1362
01:18:45,834 --> 01:18:47,612
SAM: Who controls him?

1363
01:18:47,612 --> 01:18:48,998
LIAM: No one at the moment.

1364
01:18:48,998 --> 01:18:49,870
MATT: Yep.

1365
01:18:49,870 --> 01:18:50,769
LAURA: Oh, you took it off?

1366
01:18:50,769 --> 01:18:51,615
LIAM: I took it off.

1367
01:18:51,615 --> 01:18:52,803
MARISHA: But you have the circlet still.

1368
01:18:52,803 --> 01:18:54,111
LIAM: Of course I have the circlet, yeah, but--

1369
01:18:54,111 --> 01:18:57,639
TALIESIN: I'll take it if no one else does.

1370
01:18:57,639 --> 01:18:58,834
LIAM: Sure.

1371
01:18:58,834 --> 01:19:04,509
TRAVIS: Can I find my way to Zanror? Is his-- is
she his wife? His woman--

1372
01:19:04,509 --> 01:19:09,702
MATT: His mate, Worra. Yeah, they're both next to
each other and as you get closer you notice most

1373
01:19:09,702 --> 01:19:15,187
of them have gathered their belongings. They have
travel packs. They have taken sacks and whatever

1374
01:19:15,187 --> 01:19:21,475
they could to bring whatever belonged to them and
it looks like they are getting ready to move. You

1375
01:19:21,475 --> 01:19:27,055
see Shale a bit behind them, as well, who has also
taken some small supplies with her one good arm

1376
01:19:27,055 --> 01:19:32,734
and putting it over her shoulder and tying it to
her armor before she grabs her staff again. So

1377
01:19:32,734 --> 01:19:35,805
you walk over to Zanror and Worra. Zanror looks
over to you as you approach, his arm still around

1378
01:19:35,805 --> 01:19:39,644
Worra's shoulder. "It's good to see you survived,
Grog."

1379
01:19:39,644 --> 01:19:48,768
TRAVIS: Yeah. Did more than that, actually. Found
our way up to the cave where Umbrasyl was. Left

1380
01:19:48,768 --> 01:19:50,368
him in pieces.

1381
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:54,202
MATT: "As Shale told us. 'The Bearded King,' she
said."

1382
01:19:54,202 --> 01:20:07,365
TRAVIS: (laughs) A word of advice. If, as you're
finding your way out of town, you were to stop by

1383
01:20:07,365 --> 01:20:14,194
a certain cave, there might be some things for you
to pick up.

1384
01:20:14,194 --> 01:20:16,422
LAURA: Gro--

1385
01:20:16,422 --> 01:20:21,336
LIAM: I take my sister, put my hand over her
mouth, and I drag her back about 30 feet.

1386
01:20:21,336 --> 01:20:25,209
MATT: He gives you a look, and looks to Worra,
looks to her belly--

1387
01:20:25,209 --> 01:20:27,513
LAURA: (whispers) That's for the people of
Westruun!

1388
01:20:27,513 --> 01:20:32,950
MATT: --and goes, "Appreciate that. We'll take what
we can."

1389
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:36,597
TRAVIS: Your little one. You take care of him.
Her. It.

1390
01:20:36,597 --> 01:20:39,009
MATT: "I will."

1391
01:20:39,009 --> 01:20:40,243
TRAVIS: All right.

1392
01:20:40,243 --> 01:20:47,541
MATT: "Do you want to come with us? We know we
cast you out once, but we're not like that

1393
01:20:47,541 --> 01:20:56,340
"anymore. The herd's dead. We go to find prosperity
with the Rivermaw. A people we wronged and we're

1394
01:20:56,340 --> 01:21:02,350
"probably going to spend some time making it up to
them, for my father's infractions. You're one of

1395
01:21:02,350 --> 01:21:05,219
"us now, and we'd be honored to have you."

1396
01:21:05,219 --> 01:21:16,099
TRAVIS: I'm honored. Truly I am. But I lost a
family, all those years ago. And while I will

1397
01:21:16,099 --> 01:21:23,144
always think fondly of you, I have a new family
now, and I must stay and guard them with my life.

1398
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:34,495
MATT: "I understand. Well. I'm not very good at
these parting pleasantries." He puts his arm out.

1399
01:21:34,495 --> 01:21:36,669
MATT and TRAVIS: (crashing sound)

1400
01:21:36,669 --> 01:21:38,486
SAM: Stereo.

1401
01:21:38,486 --> 01:21:41,199
TRAVIS: Come on, it blew your hair back when it
happened.

1402
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:43,186
MATT: Yeah, a little bit, little bit.

1403
01:21:43,186 --> 01:21:44,793
TRAVIS: Magnavox, like (squeal sound)!

1404
01:21:44,793 --> 01:21:54,901
MATT: "You be safe. You find your way, head north
of the Silvercut. You're always welcome in our tents."

1405
01:21:54,901 --> 01:21:58,626
TRAVIS: I'll keep that in mind. Travel safely.

1406
01:21:58,626 --> 01:22:07,734
MATT: He goes ahead and takes up his bags. Shale
takes up her staff, comes up to you, and: "We'll

1407
01:22:07,734 --> 01:22:10,958
"see each other again, Grog. Of this I'm sure."

1408
01:22:10,958 --> 01:22:17,396
TRAVIS: Yeah. Hm, totally sure, heh. You look out
for that other eye now. Don't lose the other,

1409
01:22:17,396 --> 01:22:19,628
because then you'll just be like (scared noise) in
the dark.

1410
01:22:19,628 --> 01:22:27,995
MATT: As you're doing that she smacks you on the
nose with the staff. "I'll be fine." And she walks

1411
01:22:27,995 --> 01:22:38,341
away with a smile on her weathered, crooked face.
Zanror yells out, "Come! We move west." Everyone

1412
01:22:38,341 --> 01:22:42,926
turns their heads and gather their things and they
walk by. As all the soldiers walk by, those

1413
01:22:42,926 --> 01:22:48,240
wounded and not, to each of you they bow their
heads in respect. And you swear you hear a couple

1414
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:55,330
of murmured "thank you" as they all solemnly make
their way out west, away from Westruun.

1415
01:22:55,330 --> 01:22:58,011
LIAM: Is it just the remainder of the herd?

1416
01:22:58,011 --> 01:22:59,018
MATT: Mm-hmm.

1417
01:22:59,018 --> 01:23:05,114
LIAM: Herd leader! We trust you will leave
something in that cave for the people of this

1418
01:23:05,114 --> 01:23:09,153
town. Something to help them recover.

1419
01:23:09,153 --> 01:23:16,606
MATT: Zanror turns to you, and says, "There's very
little in our lifestyle that really has use of

1420
01:23:16,606 --> 01:23:22,600
"this coin, just enough to make it from place to
place if need be. Besides, occasionally we need

1421
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:30,860
"supplies, something to trade with. I'm not like my
father. This I've learned in recent months."

1422
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:33,559
LIAM: Prosperity on your family.

1423
01:23:33,559 --> 01:23:40,013
MATT: "Hm." Looks to Grog. "Your family as well."
Turns around and continues to walk.

1424
01:23:40,013 --> 01:23:43,247
LAURA: You're lucky he's nice, Grog.

1425
01:23:43,247 --> 01:23:45,213
TRAVIS: What, what?

1426
01:23:45,213 --> 01:23:48,870
LAURA: Offering all the gold to the herd instead
of the people of Westruun.

1427
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:51,958
TRAVIS: I didn't offer all of it. I said there was
something to pick up. He might have grabbed a

1428
01:23:51,958 --> 01:23:54,042
bunch of mud, what are you so upset about?

1429
01:23:54,042 --> 01:23:55,585
LIAM: He meant well.

1430
01:23:55,585 --> 01:23:56,662
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1431
01:23:56,662 --> 01:23:59,202
MATT: As you guys make your way-- uh, where are
you heading?

1432
01:23:59,202 --> 01:24:01,377
SAM: Into Westruun?

1433
01:24:01,377 --> 01:24:03,018
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1434
01:24:03,018 --> 01:24:07,147
MARISHA: Is the gold pile trap still there?

1435
01:24:07,147 --> 01:24:08,619
MATT: It is, yes.

1436
01:24:08,619 --> 01:24:10,591
TALIESIN: It's sprung. We have to pick it up.

1437
01:24:10,591 --> 01:24:11,949
LAURA: Is our gold still there?

1438
01:24:11,949 --> 01:24:13,440
MATT: Your gold is not there.

1439
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,903
(groaning)

1440
01:24:14,903 --> 01:24:17,339
LAURA: It's a good thing I only put a little bit
in.

1441
01:24:17,339 --> 01:24:22,454
LIAM: I'm going to go take like five minutes. I'm
going to kneel down and sort of meditate in front

1442
01:24:22,454 --> 01:24:23,733
of one of the pyres.

1443
01:24:23,733 --> 01:24:29,816
MATT: Okay. (laughing) But what you do notice,
ironically, while the gold is still there, it's

1444
01:24:29,816 --> 01:24:35,202
scattered about. Because there's been an explosion
where the gold was left behind.

1445
01:24:35,202 --> 01:24:38,259
LAURA: (gasps) Oh shit.

1446
01:24:38,259 --> 01:24:39,920
ASHLEY: Oops.

1447
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,724
(laughter)

1448
01:24:41,724 --> 01:24:47,578
ASHLEY: My bad. I made a bomb!

1449
01:24:47,578 --> 01:24:56,604
MATT: Nearby, there is a groove in the dirt that
is dragged on for about four, five hundred feet,

1450
01:24:56,604 --> 01:24:59,510
before there appears to be a body at the edge.

1451
01:24:59,510 --> 01:25:00,955
LIAM: Dead dwarf?

1452
01:25:00,955 --> 01:25:02,915
MARISHA: It's a dwarf?

1453
01:25:02,915 --> 01:25:06,595
MATT: No, it's not. It's the gentleman who
disappeared as you let him out of prison.

1454
01:25:06,595 --> 01:25:07,947
(shouting)

1455
01:25:07,947 --> 01:25:10,044
TRAVIS: That son of a bitch! That thieving
bastard?

1456
01:25:10,044 --> 01:25:11,606
LAURA: He deserves it!

1457
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:14,590
MARISHA: The fucking asshole that peaced out!

1458
01:25:14,590 --> 01:25:16,723
TRAVIS: Blackfoot-- what was his name?

1459
01:25:16,723 --> 01:25:18,281
MATT: Oran Blackfoot.

1460
01:25:18,281 --> 01:25:21,292
LAURA: I knew he was going to go for the gold.
That's what he thought he was going to do.

1461
01:25:21,292 --> 01:25:25,761
MATT: As soon as you guys left, he seized the
opportunity.

1462
01:25:25,761 --> 01:25:28,043
(laughter)

1463
01:25:28,043 --> 01:25:30,634
TRAVIS: Good kill. Good kill.

1464
01:25:30,634 --> 01:25:33,927
ASHLEY: All right, all right, all right.

1465
01:25:33,927 --> 01:25:37,898
LIAM: I'm taking a moment to pay my respects to
the dead.

1466
01:25:37,898 --> 01:25:39,245
MATT: Okay.

1467
01:25:39,245 --> 01:25:41,147
MARISHA: I do the same.

1468
01:25:41,147 --> 01:25:46,096
TALIESIN: I'm attuning Fassbender. And working on
getting the chain removed from him.

1469
01:25:46,096 --> 01:25:52,248
MARISHA: Keyleth takes a minute to Druidcraft some
wildflowers around the pyre.

1470
01:25:52,248 --> 01:26:00,199
MATT: Okay. As you guys are taking this break,
Vex, you notice a small group of individuals

1471
01:26:00,199 --> 01:26:04,619
walking from the town in your direction. Make a
perception check.

1472
01:26:04,619 --> 01:26:17,801
LAURA: I bent my paper. (high voice) 17!

1473
01:26:17,801 --> 01:26:26,140
MATT: Okay. You glance over and, best you can
make out, some appear to be armored, some appear

1474
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:32,502
to be just carrying sacks and goods. There's a
cart being dragged behind with two beasts of

1475
01:26:32,502 --> 01:26:43,402
burden affixed to the front, a set of horses, and
at the front of them you see a human male wearing

1476
01:26:43,402 --> 01:26:53,004
chain mail with a heavy shield to one side,
walking up and approaching. He's mid to late 40s,

1477
01:26:53,004 --> 01:26:59,699
big black- and gray-streaked beard pulled into two
points, wild crazy-looking dark hair, also gray

1478
01:26:59,699 --> 01:27:05,197
streaked. Sun-dappled nose. He walks up with his
hand in the air.

1479
01:27:05,197 --> 01:27:06,913
LAURA: Oi, friend.

1480
01:27:06,913 --> 01:27:08,869
MATT: Can we go ahead and have our guest enter?

1481
01:27:08,869 --> 01:27:11,203
LAURA: Ooh!

1482
01:27:11,203 --> 01:27:13,820
LIAM: I know that guy!

1483
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:18,464
(cheers)

1484
01:27:18,464 --> 01:27:21,407
SAM: Sorry for the wait.

1485
01:27:21,407 --> 01:27:24,200
MATT: We had to have a hot spring episode.

1486
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:26,875
MARISHA: Very important cannonball competition we
had to get to.

1487
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:31,905
PATRICK: I'm sorry that I was laughing loud enough
for the mics to pick it up. Some people on Twitter

1488
01:27:31,905 --> 01:27:33,757
were saying that they heard me laugh.

1489
01:27:33,757 --> 01:27:37,531
MATT: That's fine. Patrick Rothfuss, joining us
today!

1490
01:27:37,531 --> 01:27:42,495
SAM: Fabulous writer. Good person.

1491
01:27:42,495 --> 01:27:44,354
PATRICK: That's not me.

1492
01:27:44,354 --> 01:27:52,267
MATT: So, as you're walking up from the city of
Westruun, carrying behind you the group of

1493
01:27:52,267 --> 01:28:00,752
eager-to-leave refugees that have gathered around
you, you notice the burning spires, and you see

1494
01:28:00,752 --> 01:28:08,954
the remnants of the horde leaving westward behind
the group of heroes that you all had feared had

1495
01:28:08,954 --> 01:28:14,567
gone to the top of the mountain to meet their
doom. They stand before you alive and resting, and

1496
01:28:14,567 --> 01:28:20,034
as you approach to hail them, one of them, the
half-elf female, hails you.

1497
01:28:20,034 --> 01:28:27,355
LAURA: Sir, how fares-- (stuttering) How are you
doing?

1498
01:28:27,355 --> 01:28:29,973
SAM: Charisma!

1499
01:28:29,973 --> 01:28:32,694
LAURA: Give me the book. Give me the book!

1500
01:28:32,694 --> 01:28:35,785
TRAVIS: Amazing. Couldn't have done any better.

1501
01:28:35,785 --> 01:28:38,795
LAURA: What's happening in the town? Are you
leaving?

1502
01:28:38,795 --> 01:28:44,058
PATRICK: How many people are left in town and how
many have come with me?

1503
01:28:44,058 --> 01:28:49,105
MATT: In town, there's probably a couple hundred
that are scattered throughout. Most of them have

1504
01:28:49,105 --> 01:28:52,593
left, the party has sent them out, but many
individuals that they didn't get to have still

1505
01:28:52,593 --> 01:28:55,909
been holed up in their homes. You have with you
right now 20 people, and these are the folks

1506
01:28:55,909 --> 01:28:59,455
that have congregated around you to figure out a
plan of what to do.

1507
01:28:59,455 --> 01:29:00,484
PATRICK: Okay.

1508
01:29:00,484 --> 01:29:02,037
SAM: What's with all the questions, narc?

1509
01:29:02,037 --> 01:29:04,153
(laughter)

1510
01:29:04,153 --> 01:29:10,659
PATRICK: I will admit I did not expect to see you
folk again.

1511
01:29:10,659 --> 01:29:12,854
LAURA: Well, we're here.

1512
01:29:12,854 --> 01:29:17,868
PATRICK: What's happened?

1513
01:29:17,868 --> 01:29:20,701
LAURA: You know that dragon?

1514
01:29:20,701 --> 01:29:22,466
PATRICK: I noticed the dragon.

1515
01:29:22,466 --> 01:29:27,010
LAURA: Gone. Killed. Destroyed. Vox Machina!

1516
01:29:27,010 --> 01:29:29,468
(laughter)

1517
01:29:29,468 --> 01:29:33,488
LAURA: Give me the book.

1518
01:29:33,488 --> 01:29:36,116
SAM: Nope.

1519
01:29:36,116 --> 01:29:47,879
PATRICK: I don't know what to say. I was expecting
to have to bury some more bodies.

1520
01:29:47,879 --> 01:29:53,818
LAURA: Thankfully, that is not the case. And you
are smart, with leaving town.

1521
01:29:53,818 --> 01:30:03,960
PATRICK: Well, the town itself hasn't decided
exactly what to do, how much to rebuild, or

1522
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:05,920
whether or not it's even worth it.

1523
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:10,600
But now, at least we can make some
plans.

1524
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:12,098
LAURA: Definitely.

1525
01:30:12,098 --> 01:30:13,655
SAM: Oi, what's your name?

1526
01:30:13,655 --> 01:30:16,661
PATRICK: Oh. My name is Kerr.

1527
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:18,011
SAM: Kerr?

1528
01:30:18,011 --> 01:30:20,059
LAURA: Like Care Bear?

1529
01:30:20,059 --> 01:30:21,580
MARISHA: Is that with a C or a K?

1530
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:23,238
PATRICK: (laughs) With a K.

1531
01:30:23,238 --> 01:30:27,586
MARISHA: Okay. Kerr. I like it.

1532
01:30:27,586 --> 01:30:30,348
SAM: And tell us about yourself, if you don't
mind.

1533
01:30:30,348 --> 01:30:44,189
PATRICK: I have been here in this town for a
while. I settled down after-- I had a bit of an

1534
01:30:44,189 --> 01:30:46,419
adventurous youth.

1535
01:30:46,419 --> 01:30:47,647
SAM: Ooh! I like!

1536
01:30:47,647 --> 01:30:48,800
TRAVIS: Yeah, me too.

1537
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:51,276
PATRICK: How old do these guys look?

1538
01:30:51,276 --> 01:30:54,700
MATT: They look younger than you. They look like a
bunch of young upstarts, for the most part.

1539
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:57,543
PATRICK: They're puppies, right?

1540
01:30:57,543 --> 01:31:03,637
MATT: They're puppies, but looking close up, you
can see weathered experiences in their eyes.

1541
01:31:03,637 --> 01:31:09,072
PATRICK: They came back from the dragon. But
still, these are like kids, right?

1542
01:31:09,072 --> 01:31:11,723
MATT: From your perspective? Yeah.

1543
01:31:11,723 --> 01:31:12,984
PATRICK: Yeah.

1544
01:31:12,984 --> 01:31:14,859
SAM: I'm an adult man!

1545
01:31:14,859 --> 01:31:18,480
MATT: Who's just roughly past your knee.

1546
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:31,467
PATRICK: I welcome you back to what is left of the
town, and I offer my thanks, and thanks on behalf

1547
01:31:31,467 --> 01:31:34,418
of those of us that are left.

1548
01:31:34,418 --> 01:31:36,455
LAURA: Are you responsible for these pyres?

1549
01:31:36,455 --> 01:31:45,031
PATRICK: The town has been pulling together, and
we have been doing what we can with what we have.

1550
01:31:45,031 --> 01:31:47,460
MARISHA: And what's your position been in
Westruun?

1551
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:51,731
PATRICK: Oh, I don't have a position in the city.
I'm just the smith.

1552
01:31:51,731 --> 01:31:54,166
LAURA: You're a blacksmith?

1553
01:31:54,166 --> 01:31:56,754
TRAVIS: You make weapons?

1554
01:31:56,754 --> 01:31:58,638
PATRICK: Yes.

1555
01:31:58,638 --> 01:31:59,897
LAURA: Armor?

1556
01:31:59,897 --> 01:32:01,010
PATRICK: Armor.

1557
01:32:01,010 --> 01:32:02,217
SAM: Percy?

1558
01:32:02,217 --> 01:32:03,616
TALIESIN: Well, I make things. They're not--

1559
01:32:03,616 --> 01:32:06,251
SAM: Maybe you guys could collab on a joint
project.

1560
01:32:06,251 --> 01:32:10,683
TALIESIN: Smithing and gadgetry, while I can see
how, to the layman, they look very similar, are in

1561
01:32:10,683 --> 01:32:11,943
fact quite different.

1562
01:32:11,943 --> 01:32:15,050
SAM: I actually might have a project for you, if
we have a moment.

1563
01:32:15,050 --> 01:32:17,850
MARISHA: Okay, before we start hitting him up for
work.

1564
01:32:17,850 --> 01:32:22,010
TALIESIN: Is this everybody you could round up to
get out of the city?

1565
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:27,790
PATRICK: Well, this is everyone who was interested
in coming out on this particular expedition.

1566
01:32:27,790 --> 01:32:30,048
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah! What is your expedition?

1567
01:32:30,048 --> 01:32:38,390
PATRICK: Mostly exploratory. Like I said, we just
didn't have any information at all. I didn't know

1568
01:32:38,390 --> 01:32:43,457
if we were going to be burying more bodies, or
dealing with an increasingly angry dragon.

1569
01:32:43,457 --> 01:32:49,533
LAURA: Well, the dragon in the mountain is dead,
but there are increasingly angered dragons in

1570
01:32:49,533 --> 01:32:52,521
other cities that will probably be coming here to
retaliate.

1571
01:32:52,521 --> 01:32:54,031
PATRICK: That will be coming here?

1572
01:32:54,031 --> 01:32:54,946
SAM: Possibly.

1573
01:32:54,946 --> 01:32:55,964
LAURA: More than likely.

1574
01:32:55,964 --> 01:32:56,953
MARISHA: Probably.

1575
01:32:56,953 --> 01:32:57,954
TALIESIN: Maybe.

1576
01:32:57,954 --> 01:32:58,787
MARISHA: We don't know.

1577
01:32:58,787 --> 01:33:00,015
TRAVIS: No. No chance.

1578
01:33:00,015 --> 01:33:01,626
(laughter)

1579
01:33:01,626 --> 01:33:06,308
SAM: Actually, this raises an important question.
What do the people of Westruun do at this point?

1580
01:33:06,308 --> 01:33:11,676
Do they rebuild? Do they go underground? Do they
leave and abandon the city?

1581
01:33:11,676 --> 01:33:16,363
LIAM: It's a huge question, yes. What do you
think, personally? What is this small group that

1582
01:33:16,363 --> 01:33:18,061
you're leading? What's your plan?

1583
01:33:18,061 --> 01:33:25,371
PATRICK: I offered to come along with them in case
they needed a strong arm. I don't speak for the

1584
01:33:25,371 --> 01:33:33,583
town. I just know most of the people involved, and
I wanted to make sure they stayed safe. But the

1585
01:33:33,583 --> 01:33:40,557
truth is, there's a lot of people who have nothing
to rebuild, and nothing to rebuild it with. And if

1586
01:33:40,557 --> 01:33:46,253
there might be dragons coming back, I don't know.

1587
01:33:46,253 --> 01:33:54,315
TRAVIS: Well, Kerr, Pike and I are both from
Westruun. Yeah. Yep.

1588
01:33:54,315 --> 01:34:00,718
ASHLEY: I've seen you before. Do you know Wilhand?
My great-great-grandfather?

1589
01:34:00,718 --> 01:34:02,635
LAURA: Great great?

1590
01:34:02,635 --> 01:34:05,765
ASHLEY: Great-great. Yeah. Two greats, not just
one.

1591
01:34:05,765 --> 01:34:14,887
MATT: A tiny, hunched over gnomish gentleman, a
little absent-minded but friendly enough, keeps to

1592
01:34:14,887 --> 01:34:16,089
himself.

1593
01:34:16,089 --> 01:34:17,121
LAURA: Likes to drink.

1594
01:34:17,121 --> 01:34:18,109
PATRICK: Ah!

1595
01:34:18,109 --> 01:34:21,377
ASHLEY: Yes. You probably have had some drinks
with him before.

1596
01:34:21,377 --> 01:34:25,621
PATRICK: A little bit. And I haven't met you, but
I've heard of you.

1597
01:34:25,621 --> 01:34:26,830
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah?

1598
01:34:26,830 --> 01:34:27,773
PATRICK: Yeah!

1599
01:34:27,773 --> 01:34:29,098
TRAVIS: What have you heard?

1600
01:34:29,098 --> 01:34:33,044
PATRICK: I heard that you were a good member of
the community.

1601
01:34:33,044 --> 01:34:34,454
TRAVIS: Yep, that's me.

1602
01:34:34,454 --> 01:34:36,675
SAM: Nope. You are incorrect.

1603
01:34:36,675 --> 01:34:37,951
TRAVIS: Totally.

1604
01:34:37,951 --> 01:34:41,320
ASHLEY: He was, and is, but we're just never
home.

1605
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:43,207
TRAVIS: Grog. Grog is my name.

1606
01:34:43,207 --> 01:34:46,604
LIAM: Kerr, do you have a sense of how many people
are left in the city, roughly?

1607
01:34:46,604 --> 01:34:50,416
PATRICK: Maybe as many as a couple hundred.

1608
01:34:50,416 --> 01:34:51,667
LAURA: Oh, that's it?

1609
01:34:51,667 --> 01:34:53,345
MARISHA: That's not a lot.

1610
01:34:53,345 --> 01:34:57,087
PATRICK: A lot of people have been leaving, but
some people can't.

1611
01:34:57,087 --> 01:35:02,695
TRAVIS: Well, look, I would just like to put this
forward. Westruun is their home. It's Pike's home,

1612
01:35:02,695 --> 01:35:07,295
it's my home. And if you start running, you never
really stop.

1613
01:35:07,295 --> 01:35:10,958
SAM: But where are they going to stay? I've been
down to the sewers, and there's crazy giant

1614
01:35:10,958 --> 01:35:12,306
creatures down there.

1615
01:35:12,306 --> 01:35:17,302
TRAVIS: Well, you can treat it like a weather
shelter. If the dragons come, we set up an early

1616
01:35:17,362 --> 01:35:21,383
warning system. They go underground. But this is
their home.

1617
01:35:21,383 --> 01:35:27,007
TALIESIN: Here's an interesting thing to
contemplate about this whole problem, is that we

1618
01:35:27,007 --> 01:35:32,566
have three dragons still at large. Three dragons
who have probably found cities of their own, so

1619
01:35:32,566 --> 01:35:37,232
the chances that they're going to come back and
take time away from their own city to go look at

1620
01:35:37,232 --> 01:35:41,693
one that's, in theory, already taken over is very
thin. And if they are traveling, then they're

1621
01:35:41,693 --> 01:35:44,007
going to travel to cities that haven't been
plundered yet.

1622
01:35:44,007 --> 01:35:46,228
LAURA: That's true, this one has been plundered.

1623
01:35:46,228 --> 01:35:50,429
TALIESIN: This is no less or more. There's a risk
either way. It's just the risk of running or the

1624
01:35:50,429 --> 01:35:51,951
risk of staying.

1625
01:35:51,951 --> 01:35:56,481
SAM: Also the dragons know that the last dragon
who came here died.

1626
01:35:56,481 --> 01:36:01,286
MARISHA: I think the dragons' motives have
probably shifted by now, and where the dragons

1627
01:36:01,286 --> 01:36:05,908
might not be interested in plundering anymore,
instead might be interested in any city that we

1628
01:36:05,908 --> 01:36:07,254
are in.

1629
01:36:07,254 --> 01:36:11,488
TALIESIN: Which, I imagine we're leaving soon,
anyway.

1630
01:36:11,488 --> 01:36:14,893
LIAM: Yeah, they might not believe we'd be here,
but they also might try to--

1631
01:36:14,893 --> 01:36:17,085
TRAVIS: Kerr, are you an honest man?

1632
01:36:17,085 --> 01:36:20,190
PATRICK: I've been called an honest man.

1633
01:36:20,190 --> 01:36:21,396
SAM: I insight check him!

1634
01:36:21,396 --> 01:36:22,863
TRAVIS: Can I insight check-- Oh yeah, you do
that.

1635
01:36:22,863 --> 01:36:24,616
(laughter)

1636
01:36:24,616 --> 01:36:26,359
MATT: You may both make insight checks.

1637
01:36:26,359 --> 01:36:30,788
SAM: 19.

1638
01:36:30,788 --> 01:36:32,526
TRAVIS: (high voice) Four.

1639
01:36:32,526 --> 01:36:36,667
TALIESIN: If you whisper to Grog, it's going to
make me really happy. Yes!

1640
01:36:36,667 --> 01:36:40,569
SAM: He just said, you fart.

1641
01:36:40,569 --> 01:36:43,296
TALIESIN: Mightily.

1642
01:36:43,296 --> 01:36:47,076
MATT: Excuse me for just a minute.

1643
01:36:47,076 --> 01:36:50,329
SAM: What was this about Loot Crate?

1644
01:36:50,329 --> 01:36:58,007
TRAVIS: Three dollars off if you use
lootcrate.com/criticalrole next week!

1645
01:36:58,007 --> 01:37:02,228
MARISHA: But that's no secret!

1646
01:37:02,228 --> 01:37:15,535
SAM: I trust him with my life. I pledge my
allegiance to you, sir.

1647
01:37:15,535 --> 01:37:18,617
TRAVIS: You just dabbed to him.

1648
01:37:18,617 --> 01:37:21,937
MARISHA: Scanlan literally hasn't said that to me
in the entire three years I've known him.

1649
01:37:21,937 --> 01:37:23,856
SAM: What was your name again?

1650
01:37:23,856 --> 01:37:28,434
TALIESIN: Scanlan just found out that Kerr has a
daughter, is what he found out.

1651
01:37:28,434 --> 01:37:30,328
TRAVIS: Wow, you pledge your life to him? Jeez.

1652
01:37:30,328 --> 01:37:35,242
MARISHA: Kerr. You said you were an adventurer
several years ago.

1653
01:37:35,242 --> 01:37:43,241
PATRICK: Many years ago. Many years ago. I've
lived here-- I've lived here a lifetime at this point.

1654
01:37:43,241 --> 01:37:46,460
MARISHA: Did you have a party that you traveled
with as well?

1655
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:48,447
PATRICK: I did.

1656
01:37:48,447 --> 01:37:52,275
MARISHA: Would we happen to know any of them?
Allura? Asum?

1657
01:37:52,275 --> 01:38:02,924
PATRICK: No, that was a long time ago, and I'd be
very surprised if you'd heard any of the stories

1658
01:38:02,924 --> 01:38:13,603
from back then. I will say, though, from what I
know about dragons, that perhaps vengeance might

1659
01:38:13,603 --> 01:38:22,605
not be outside a reasonable expectation. There
might not be anything here for them to plunder, but--

1660
01:38:22,605 --> 01:38:27,943
MARISHA: But no one likes having their ass handed
to them.

1661
01:38:27,943 --> 01:38:36,434
PATRICK: And these creatures are old and
intelligent and powerful, and they stay that way

1662
01:38:36,434 --> 01:38:51,315
by striking fear into people. And (sighs) as much
as I hate to leave my own home, I don't know who

1663
01:38:51,315 --> 01:38:57,276
will be able to help my people if any other things
like this happen.

1664
01:38:57,276 --> 01:39:01,062
MARISHA: We can't be everywhere at once.

1665
01:39:01,062 --> 01:39:03,076
LIAM: What about the sewers?

1666
01:39:03,076 --> 01:39:06,317
SAM: Well, we were down there, and there was
horrible, creepy things.

1667
01:39:06,317 --> 01:39:08,152
LIAM: We could help with that.

1668
01:39:08,152 --> 01:39:09,862
SAM: We could clear out the sewers.

1669
01:39:09,862 --> 01:39:11,751
MARISHA: But that's not indefinite.

1670
01:39:11,751 --> 01:39:13,193
TRAVIS: No, it's not.

1671
01:39:13,193 --> 01:39:14,572
MARISHA: They'll be back.

1672
01:39:14,572 --> 01:39:16,764
LAURA: The only other option is--

1673
01:39:16,764 --> 01:39:20,276
TALIESIN: There's the traveling band, by the
river.

1674
01:39:20,276 --> 01:39:25,358
LAURA: Split the city up? Set them on different
paths?

1675
01:39:25,358 --> 01:39:26,822
LIAM: There's Whitestone.

1676
01:39:26,822 --> 01:39:30,324
TALIESIN: Whitestone is rapidly becoming a very
large target.

1677
01:39:30,324 --> 01:39:33,491
LAURA: Very quickly becoming noticeable, I think.

1678
01:39:33,491 --> 01:39:37,909
LIAM: Ever been to Vasselheim?

1679
01:39:37,909 --> 01:39:47,225
PATRICK: Refugees are often very unwelcome, too,
and most of the people here did not have much left

1680
01:39:47,225 --> 01:39:49,655
to lose before they lost it.

1681
01:39:49,655 --> 01:39:58,295
LAURA: We have claim to the gold that was stolen.
It's up in the mountain. It's just hard to get down.

1682
01:39:58,295 --> 01:40:03,330
TALIESIN: Someone honest is going to have to come
and help divvy it up amongst the survivors.

1683
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:06,240
PATRICK: We can look for an honest person.

1684
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:12,964
MARISHA: But if all of the survivors are
evacuating the city--

1685
01:40:12,964 --> 01:40:27,292
PATRICK: We could probably-- I know enough people
to put together a group of carters to go up there

1686
01:40:27,292 --> 01:40:29,063
and start fetching stuff down?

1687
01:40:29,063 --> 01:40:31,441
MATT: Yeah. And the people that have gathered
around you are people that have been around you

1688
01:40:31,441 --> 01:40:34,260
most of the time you've been in the city, or
at least have known you long enough to the point

1689
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:38,916
where they themselves are also like-minded, so you
can trust most of the folks that have walked with

1690
01:40:38,916 --> 01:40:40,590
you out towards the pyres.

1691
01:40:40,590 --> 01:40:46,905
PATRICK: I'll say, excuse me for just a minute,
and I'll walk off and I'll chat with them a little

1692
01:40:46,905 --> 01:40:53,707
bit, so you can see that I'm pointing up. I'll do
a little talk off with them, so you can talk about

1693
01:40:53,707 --> 01:40:55,307
me behind my-- Without me.

1694
01:40:55,307 --> 01:40:58,143
SAM: I like this guy.

1695
01:40:58,143 --> 01:40:59,509
TRAVIS: You do?

1696
01:40:59,509 --> 01:41:01,713
LAURA: Why do you pledge yourself to him?

1697
01:41:01,713 --> 01:41:07,137
SAM: I just feel like he's an honest man. He's a
good guy. He's got a nice twinkle in his eye and I

1698
01:41:07,137 --> 01:41:10,910
recognize that as a sign of honesty, because I
have a similar feature.

1699
01:41:10,910 --> 01:41:14,052
LAURA: You do? I've never noticed a twinkle in
your eye.

1700
01:41:14,052 --> 01:41:17,526
SAM: Yeah, the light has to hit it just--

1701
01:41:17,526 --> 01:41:20,556
LAURA: No, it's a crusty from the morning. You
might just-- yeah.

1702
01:41:20,556 --> 01:41:22,397
TALIESIN: How do you get glitter in there?

1703
01:41:22,397 --> 01:41:26,261
TRAVIS: That seems like such a shame. I mean,
shouldn't we ask the people of Westruun if they

1704
01:41:26,261 --> 01:41:27,911
want to stay or go?

1705
01:41:27,911 --> 01:41:31,487
SAM: Well, there's only 200. We could have a huge
meeting and put it to a vote.

1706
01:41:31,487 --> 01:41:33,114
TRAVIS: A town hall thing?

1707
01:41:33,114 --> 01:41:34,237
LAURA: Why not?

1708
01:41:34,237 --> 01:41:38,588
MARISHA: But he said some people were incapable of
leaving. There might be elderly and sick here that

1709
01:41:38,588 --> 01:41:40,177
can't travel.

1710
01:41:40,177 --> 01:41:43,343
SAM: Is there a way to hide the city with magic?
We've seen that done before.

1711
01:41:43,343 --> 01:41:45,392
LAURA: Can we make it look like it's already been
burned down?

1712
01:41:45,392 --> 01:41:47,102
TALIESIN: It has already been burned down.

1713
01:41:47,102 --> 01:41:48,861
MATT: (laughs)

1714
01:41:48,861 --> 01:41:50,306
TALIESIN: That won't be hard at all.

1715
01:41:50,306 --> 01:41:51,288
LAURA: Can we hide?

1716
01:41:51,288 --> 01:41:56,987
LIAM: Can't they have sentries and a shelter in
the sewers? They could clear out part of it and

1717
01:41:56,987 --> 01:42:03,169
have sentries every night, and any time a dragon
comes, they just go underground and wait. Wait it out.

1718
01:42:03,169 --> 01:42:07,821
TALIESIN: I don't think this is a terrible-- I
think this is a pretty reasonable idea.

1719
01:42:07,821 --> 01:42:09,617
LAURA: What do you think, Grog, Pike?

1720
01:42:09,617 --> 01:42:10,905
TRAVIS: That's what I said.

1721
01:42:10,905 --> 01:42:12,530
ASHLEY: I feel like it's a good idea.

1722
01:42:12,530 --> 01:42:14,182
TRAVIS: Yeah. I don't--

1723
01:42:14,182 --> 01:42:17,311
MARISHA: Hang on, hold the phone. Hold the phone.

1724
01:42:17,311 --> 01:42:20,475
SAM: We could spend a few days here and get them
started before we go on to our next thing.

1725
01:42:20,475 --> 01:42:24,207
TRAVIS: It's so hard to find shelter and
protection that's not a city where you're

1726
01:42:24,207 --> 01:42:25,979
unwelcome in the first place.

1727
01:42:25,979 --> 01:42:28,719
TALIESIN: Well, this is an unwelcome world at the
moment.

1728
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:31,447
LAURA: We could leave Fassbender here to help
protect everyone.

1729
01:42:31,447 --> 01:42:33,918
SAM: Yes, I guess if we gave him away. But we need
him.

1730
01:42:33,918 --> 01:42:35,529
TALIESIN: Do we need him?

1731
01:42:35,529 --> 01:42:37,345
LIAM: He's going to slow us down.

1732
01:42:37,345 --> 01:42:39,684
LAURA: How are we going to get Fassbender anywhere
with us?

1733
01:42:39,684 --> 01:42:41,191
SAM: Tell him to walk.

1734
01:42:41,191 --> 01:42:42,577
TRAVIS: Are we returning the band?

1735
01:42:42,577 --> 01:42:48,169
MARISHA: Yeah, Quall did want the circlet at some
point. It's not necessarily ours to give away.

1736
01:42:48,169 --> 01:42:49,567
LAURA: Quall's evil.

1737
01:42:49,567 --> 01:42:50,985
TALIESIN: Is he?

1738
01:42:50,985 --> 01:42:52,846
MARISHA: Selfish, maybe.

1739
01:42:52,846 --> 01:42:55,449
TALIESIN: We are under contract, technically.

1740
01:42:55,449 --> 01:42:56,913
LAURA: This is true.

1741
01:42:56,913 --> 01:42:58,703
MARISHA: What were you going to say, Pike?

1742
01:42:58,703 --> 01:43:01,053
ASHLEY: We could just leave it with Wilhand.

1743
01:43:01,053 --> 01:43:03,333
MARISHA: We could leave it with Wilhand,
actually.

1744
01:43:03,333 --> 01:43:05,135
ASHLEY: And then we could tell Quall--

1745
01:43:05,135 --> 01:43:08,317
LIAM: Oh, Quall, we didn't know where you were, we
couldn't find you, we left it with Wilhand.

1746
01:43:08,317 --> 01:43:10,520
ASHLEY: We wanted to leave it in one place, just
in case we see you again.

1747
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:12,065
SAM: Is that your lying voice?

1748
01:43:12,065 --> 01:43:14,083
LIAM: Sorry, buddy.

1749
01:43:14,083 --> 01:43:18,314
PATRICK: What is the general atmosphere in town?
Are people just done?

1750
01:43:18,314 --> 01:43:24,139
TRAVIS: Yeah, right? I'm fucking over this shit!

1751
01:43:24,139 --> 01:43:28,348
MATT: Best that you can ascertain, a lot of people
are scared because they were separated from their

1752
01:43:28,348 --> 01:43:34,398
families. A large bulk of people left south to
Kymal, which is the nearest township to Westruun

1753
01:43:34,398 --> 01:43:40,161
that feasibly could take in refugees. They left
directly after the dragon attack, even before the

1754
01:43:40,161 --> 01:43:46,464
herd was there. When the herd came in, the maybe
ten percent, 15 percent of people that stayed

1755
01:43:46,464 --> 01:43:53,874
behind were then captured, some of them were
killed as they fought back, many were enslaved and

1756
01:43:53,874 --> 01:43:59,304
brutalized, and a number of them did escape thanks
to this group's efforts. So I'd say those that are

1757
01:43:59,304 --> 01:44:04,065
left behind, they're eager to see their families.
They're probably eager to leave for the time

1758
01:44:04,065 --> 01:44:08,788
being. Some of them do want to stay just because
they're stubborn, but the majority seems

1759
01:44:08,788 --> 01:44:13,370
interested in not being in a place that could be a
target for more dragon attacks, as rumors have

1760
01:44:13,370 --> 01:44:17,624
come back that there is more than just the black
dragon, and many of them recall the red, the

1761
01:44:17,624 --> 01:44:21,838
green, and the white that came with the initial
onslaught that tore through the city. Or it

1762
01:44:21,838 --> 01:44:24,479
would've been the green and the white.

1763
01:44:24,479 --> 01:44:31,428
PATRICK: Okay, yeah. So I'll wander back, and I
say, my friends here are willing to go on a

1764
01:44:31,428 --> 01:44:39,830
retrieval mission. I'm assuming you folks could
use some rest, and the hospitality of the town

1765
01:44:39,830 --> 01:44:47,538
isn't what it used to be, but I'm sure a lot of
people would be very glad to see you. Have you set

1766
01:44:47,538 --> 01:44:51,551
up protections? Did you hide the treasure?

1767
01:44:51,551 --> 01:44:55,514
LAURA: We did. We did. It's hidden in a cubby with
a little mark on it.

1768
01:44:55,514 --> 01:44:57,891
SAM: We'll give you instructions.

1769
01:44:57,891 --> 01:44:59,652
PATRICK: Sketch out something.

1770
01:44:59,652 --> 01:45:01,360
TALIESIN: Including a little walk around.

1771
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,042
LAURA: Oh, yeah, the walk around is important.

1772
01:45:03,042 --> 01:45:07,080
TRAVIS: But there are stuff out there in the
woods. There are things.

1773
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:09,161
SAM: He's a strong man.

1774
01:45:09,161 --> 01:45:15,468
PATRICK: And I've got, these are the more capable,
these folks can go out on their own?

1775
01:45:15,468 --> 01:45:23,804
MATT: A number of them can, yeah. Some of them
were there for general visual support,

1776
01:45:23,804 --> 01:45:28,579
carrying things forth and stewards that have taken
up arms because they have to, but you're

1777
01:45:28,579 --> 01:45:32,450
essentially the strongest of a group of relatively
capable individuals.

1778
01:45:32,450 --> 01:45:37,266
TRAVIS: I'd hate to send you into anything that
all of a sudden got a bit too nasty. I see you

1779
01:45:37,266 --> 01:45:40,701
wearing chain mail. If I may, what is your weapon
of choice?

1780
01:45:40,701 --> 01:45:47,316
PATRICK: I'm partial-- I was partial to the
warhammer.

1781
01:45:47,316 --> 01:45:55,299
TRAVIS: Ooh. I reach out to shake his hand. I like
your choice.

1782
01:45:55,299 --> 01:46:01,068
ASHLEY: Kerr, do you know how to make armor be
quiet?

1783
01:46:01,068 --> 01:46:04,386
(laughter)

1784
01:46:04,386 --> 01:46:12,616
PATRICK: That's probably the first laugh you get.
I've been there. I lived there a long time. We

1785
01:46:12,616 --> 01:46:20,013
could talk shop about that.

1786
01:46:20,013 --> 01:46:23,588
ASHLEY: I love talking shop. Let's do it.

1787
01:46:23,588 --> 01:46:34,473
PATRICK: I'll set up a little expedition and I'll
send people out, knowing that a lot of these folks

1788
01:46:34,473 --> 01:46:40,653
that are here are going to head out. They're going
to need resources, and based on what they've said,

1789
01:46:40,653 --> 01:46:43,369
my team can go out and get some of this treasure?

1790
01:46:43,369 --> 01:46:46,612
MATT: Yeah, based on the description they've said
and the sheer volume that's there, they end up

1791
01:46:46,612 --> 01:46:53,853
taking four carts that are capable of doing a
somewhat treacherous mountain journey with the

1792
01:46:53,853 --> 01:46:57,038
strong individuals you send up as well. I don't
know if you wanted to go up with them or stay

1793
01:46:57,038 --> 01:46:58,123
behind.

1794
01:46:58,123 --> 01:47:04,086
PATRICK: It sounds reasonably clear. We'll send up
a good group with spare parts, and they're all

1795
01:47:04,086 --> 01:47:07,155
craftsmen here, they're all farmers, they can fix
a cart if it breaks.

1796
01:47:07,155 --> 01:47:15,492
TRAVIS: Is there any way for them to contact you
if shit goes down while they're up there? If we

1797
01:47:15,492 --> 01:47:18,498
need to go in as the cavalry to the rescue?

1798
01:47:18,498 --> 01:47:21,595
PATRICK: Are there any--?

1799
01:47:21,595 --> 01:47:24,430
SAM: We can send one of the stones with them.

1800
01:47:24,430 --> 01:47:26,190
LAURA: (groans)

1801
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:30,116
PATRICK: Anybody with cantrippy message
sending--?

1802
01:47:30,116 --> 01:47:35,138
MATT: Unfortunately, anybody with any modicum of
arcane practitioning capability left.

1803
01:47:35,138 --> 01:47:36,952
PATRICK: They beat feet long ago. Yeah.

1804
01:47:36,952 --> 01:47:39,330
MATT: As soon as shit hit the fan, they were like,
nope!

1805
01:47:39,330 --> 01:47:44,746
PATRICK: I think at this point, it's people that
are stubborn and with really low intelligence

1806
01:47:44,746 --> 01:47:47,988
scores are the only folks left, so the wizards
went right away.

1807
01:47:47,988 --> 01:47:55,628
TALIESIN: It's appropriate on occasion to leave
people to a modicum of risk. Life is risky. It's

1808
01:47:55,628 --> 01:47:58,161
perfectly reasonable to send people on
themselves.

1809
01:47:58,161 --> 01:48:01,184
LIAM: Can we steer them away from the area where
we ran into those basilisks?

1810
01:48:01,184 --> 01:48:04,954
LAURA: Yes, we will tell you about the basilisks.

1811
01:48:04,954 --> 01:48:06,282
TALIESIN: They're locals. They should know.

1812
01:48:06,282 --> 01:48:07,787
MATT: Well, the basilisks were far south. That was
in the Frostweald.

1813
01:48:07,787 --> 01:48:08,947
LAURA: Oh, never mind.

1814
01:48:08,947 --> 01:48:12,653
MATT: As far as you know, they were nowhere near
the Bramblewood, thankfully.

1815
01:48:12,653 --> 01:48:18,083
LAURA: So what should we do here, clear out the
sewers? Because that's what was said.

1816
01:48:18,083 --> 01:48:23,801
SAM: Wait, there's three options for these people,
and they have to decide for us. They can stay here

1817
01:48:23,801 --> 01:48:26,845
and live in the sewers. They can go to, what's it
called?

1818
01:48:26,845 --> 01:48:27,996
MATT: Kymal.

1819
01:48:27,996 --> 01:48:33,012
SAM: Kymal, where they're still accepting
refugees, or they can wander off into the desert.

1820
01:48:33,012 --> 01:48:36,751
TALIESIN: Well, there's also that group of people
wandering around. There's that group.

1821
01:48:36,751 --> 01:48:38,208
SAM: That's what I'm saying.

1822
01:48:38,208 --> 01:48:43,211
TRAVIS: Hey, guys, so remember the farmer?
Outside, and then he turned into a scarecrow?

1823
01:48:43,211 --> 01:48:44,722
MARISHA: Yes, we remember.

1824
01:48:44,722 --> 01:48:46,912
TRAVIS: I found his daughter.

1825
01:48:46,912 --> 01:48:48,352
SAM: Oh, where is she?

1826
01:48:48,352 --> 01:48:49,441
LAURA: Did you tell her?

1827
01:48:49,441 --> 01:48:51,936
TRAVIS: No, no, I didn't know what to do. She
looked like a deer in the headlights.

1828
01:48:51,936 --> 01:48:53,461
LAURA: Where is she?

1829
01:48:53,461 --> 01:49:04,261
TRAVIS: She was in the prison with Abjurist Noja
and Blackfoot, who's now dead. What's her name

1830
01:49:04,261 --> 01:49:05,488
again?

1831
01:49:05,488 --> 01:49:06,441
MATT: Amelia.

1832
01:49:06,441 --> 01:49:08,021
TRAVIS: Amelia, really sweet.

1833
01:49:08,021 --> 01:49:10,973
MARISHA: Did you send her towards refugees?

1834
01:49:10,973 --> 01:49:12,152
SAM: Is she around?

1835
01:49:12,152 --> 01:49:17,088
TRAVIS: I brought her out before we took the fight
to the dragon, so I think she's still in the town,

1836
01:49:17,088 --> 01:49:18,657
but I don't want to tell her.

1837
01:49:18,657 --> 01:49:20,291
LAURA: We should tell her, Grog.

1838
01:49:20,291 --> 01:49:24,600
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know, and maybe give her a little
coin, but, Pike, do you think maybe you could--

1839
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:27,399
ASHLEY: Tell her?

1840
01:49:27,399 --> 01:49:28,428
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1841
01:49:28,428 --> 01:49:29,430
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1842
01:49:29,430 --> 01:49:30,523
TRAVIS: Okay.

1843
01:49:30,523 --> 01:49:32,516
LIAM: Do I remember where he is?

1844
01:49:32,516 --> 01:49:35,479
MATT: Where Reginald is? Yeah.

1845
01:49:35,479 --> 01:49:37,062
LIAM: I head off that way.

1846
01:49:37,062 --> 01:49:40,782
MATT: Okay. It's directly west of the town, so
it's pretty much south of where you guys are

1847
01:49:40,782 --> 01:49:45,604
currently standing, because the drop point was
northwest of the city. He is still affixed.

1848
01:49:45,604 --> 01:49:48,229
LIAM: I bring him back here.

1849
01:49:48,229 --> 01:49:53,991
TRAVIS: Make him sound real brave, you know. Paint
a good picture when you talk to her.

1850
01:49:53,991 --> 01:49:56,265
TALIESIN: He was real brave.

1851
01:49:56,265 --> 01:50:00,953
LAURA: There's only about 200 people left. Do you
know someone named Amelia?

1852
01:50:00,953 --> 01:50:07,782
MATT: You know of Amelia, though you-- No, you did
see her last night. You hadn't seen her in a

1853
01:50:07,782 --> 01:50:13,363
while. She was one of the people that was still in
the town. She was peripheral to the battle with

1854
01:50:13,363 --> 01:50:17,947
the dragon, but fled as soon as she saw it.
Unfortunately, dragons have that effect on people.

1855
01:50:17,947 --> 01:50:23,164
She was a little shamed by it, but you calmed her
down. But you do know that she's safe and

1856
01:50:23,164 --> 01:50:24,695
reachable.

1857
01:50:24,695 --> 01:50:26,536
PATRICK: Yeah, she's around.

1858
01:50:26,536 --> 01:50:31,010
LAURA: Where is everyone staying within the town?
Are they scattered about or are they staying in a

1859
01:50:31,010 --> 01:50:32,468
central location?

1860
01:50:32,468 --> 01:50:38,857
PATRICK: We've organized places for people to
sleep if they don't have places for themselves.

1861
01:50:38,857 --> 01:50:43,308
It's makeshift, but-- because it's been a couple
of days, at this point?

1862
01:50:43,308 --> 01:50:46,670
MATT: Yeah, it's been almost two days since the
initial encounter.

1863
01:50:46,670 --> 01:50:54,633
PATRICK: Right, so we've got triage camps set up.
I will say, some people are going to stay no

1864
01:50:54,633 --> 01:50:58,800
matter what, and they have the right to stay, and
that's their choice. I imagine some people will

1865
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:06,900
come back and rebuild here, but most people, they
are ready to go. They miss their families.

1866
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:08,858
LAURA: An entire city.

1867
01:51:08,858 --> 01:51:12,916
TALIESIN: We can build a dragon shelter. At the
very least, that is something we can do.

1868
01:51:12,916 --> 01:51:17,277
MARISHA: But these people are prisoners here. They
feel like they're prisoners in their own home, and

1869
01:51:17,277 --> 01:51:18,792
that's not a home.

1870
01:51:18,792 --> 01:51:20,857
TRAVIS: Then we let them make their choice.

1871
01:51:20,857 --> 01:51:24,944
TALIESIN: They'll do what they're going to do, but
we can give them an option if things get hairy.

1872
01:51:24,944 --> 01:51:27,102
LAURA: Let's make our way toward them, then.

1873
01:51:27,102 --> 01:51:34,455
MATT: Okay. You guys make your way towards town.
The largest concentration of survivors that you've

1874
01:51:34,455 --> 01:51:41,753
been keeping tabs on actually aren't that far from
Wilhand's home, in the area where most of the

1875
01:51:41,753 --> 01:51:45,112
temples are constructed, which is generally
considered one of the oldest and most protected

1876
01:51:45,112 --> 01:51:53,351
areas of Westruun. There are two inns that are
basically now ramshackle homes for sleep. There's

1877
01:51:53,351 --> 01:51:57,370
bedspreads across the entire floor, all the tables
and chairs have been moved out, and it's now just

1878
01:51:57,370 --> 01:52:02,020
a giant room where people who had their homes
destroyed come and sleep, not because it's

1879
01:52:02,020 --> 01:52:07,150
comfortable, but because there's comfort and
safety in numbers. People have gathered what

1880
01:52:07,150 --> 01:52:10,812
belongings they still had that are worth
anything or they might need for a journey. Many of

1881
01:52:10,812 --> 01:52:15,285
them are still gathering bits of dried food and
fruit and whatever, preparing for whatever the

1882
01:52:15,285 --> 01:52:22,151
next step of their travels may be. But you
probably have the bulk of the people in the town,

1883
01:52:22,151 --> 01:52:25,847
other than a few older, very stubborn folks that
are like, "I'm going to stay in my home!" The

1884
01:52:25,847 --> 01:52:31,191
folks that stayed at Mt. St. Helens, where you're
like, come on, guys, seriously?

1885
01:52:31,191 --> 01:52:32,744
(laughter)

1886
01:52:32,744 --> 01:52:34,052
PATRICK: There's always some.

1887
01:52:34,052 --> 01:52:39,203
MATT: There's always some. But yeah, so as you
approach and the door swings open to the first

1888
01:52:39,203 --> 01:52:43,761
tavern, as you introduce them too, a few of the
folks perk up. A few children who couldn't sleep

1889
01:52:43,761 --> 01:52:49,574
look over. Two of the kids that recognize you run
up, "Uncle Kerrek!" They run up and grab the side

1890
01:52:49,574 --> 01:52:51,784
of your legs. Your chain mail clanks and you pick
them up.

1891
01:52:51,784 --> 01:52:55,522
ASHLEY: I look around for Wilhand.

1892
01:52:55,522 --> 01:53:02,814
MATT: Wilhand is not amongst this group. Wilhand
probably stayed safe within his home, which kept

1893
01:53:02,814 --> 01:53:05,106
him safe up to this point, so far.

1894
01:53:05,106 --> 01:53:06,813
TRAVIS: Do we see Amelia?

1895
01:53:06,813 --> 01:53:10,701
MATT: Looking about, yes, you do see Amelia. She
is asleep right now, though.

1896
01:53:10,701 --> 01:53:12,891
SAM: Wake her up! Tell her her dad's dead!

1897
01:53:12,891 --> 01:53:17,896
MARISHA: Hey, hey. It's really important. I need
to tell you right now.

1898
01:53:17,896 --> 01:53:19,218
ASHLEY: We see her?

1899
01:53:19,218 --> 01:53:23,612
MATT: You see her. She's asleep. It's later in the
day from the travel, you guys went down the

1900
01:53:23,612 --> 01:53:26,814
mountain to even get here after you woke up in the
morning. You spent most of the day getting back to

1901
01:53:26,814 --> 01:53:31,508
Westruun, so you're getting pretty close to
sunset. The group has been set off for the

1902
01:53:31,508 --> 01:53:37,226
evening's travel toward the top of Gatshadow. She
appears to have fallen asleep early.

1903
01:53:37,226 --> 01:53:46,374
PATRICK: I'll start a few things, and I'll spread
the word. Everybody could really use a bit of a

1904
01:53:46,374 --> 01:53:54,253
party here. We don't have many resources, but I'm
betting there's enough liquor for everybody to get

1905
01:53:54,253 --> 01:53:55,638
good and drunk tonight.

1906
01:53:55,638 --> 01:53:56,677
MATT: Oh yeah.

1907
01:53:56,677 --> 01:54:02,315
PATRICK: That's the resource there's always an
abundance of at this point. We'll kind of put the

1908
01:54:02,315 --> 01:54:07,407
word out, and honestly, I don't need to organize
it. I can just say, "Dragon's dead, and they did

1909
01:54:07,407 --> 01:54:10,431
"it. We're going to throw them a party tonight."
And I'm just going to let that happen.

1910
01:54:10,431 --> 01:54:16,450
MATT: And with each chain of that word spreading,
the energy immediately lifts up within the room,

1911
01:54:16,450 --> 01:54:21,295
and the building adjacent, and folks that were
either resting or in a state of perpetual

1912
01:54:21,295 --> 01:54:25,738
anxiousness suddenly brighten up, even with the
dirt-smeared faces, you can see smiles poking out

1913
01:54:25,738 --> 01:54:30,907
as people begin coming into the room to see those
who slew the dragon that threatened them. People

1914
01:54:30,907 --> 01:54:34,054
start coming up and shaking your hands,
individuals who haven't seen you guys for years,

1915
01:54:34,054 --> 01:54:37,456
people that lived down the street and gave you a
passing hello in the younger days of your youth,

1916
01:54:37,456 --> 01:54:45,364
are now coming up to you with a look of absolute
appreciation and thanks. Just as that energy picks

1917
01:54:45,364 --> 01:54:51,518
up, the wine and the ale begin to go throughout
the area as stores of them beneath the taverns

1918
01:54:51,518 --> 01:54:56,097
that were not found by the herd, as there were
only so many members of the herd and a larger

1919
01:54:56,097 --> 01:55:03,261
number of actual inns and taverns throughout the
town, people start grabbing cups. Even some of the

1920
01:55:03,261 --> 01:55:07,984
kids start coming up with cups, and the parents
are like, "Hmm, a little." It's New Year's, you

1921
01:55:07,984 --> 01:55:09,377
can have a sip.

1922
01:55:09,377 --> 01:55:12,561
TALIESIN: It's medieval times, everybody drinks.

1923
01:55:12,561 --> 01:55:22,461
MATT: Without much worry at that point, everyone's
getting nice and liquored up, and happiness has

1924
01:55:22,461 --> 01:55:27,248
ensued. Some folks pull out some meager
instruments. There aren't a lot of extremely

1925
01:55:27,248 --> 01:55:33,122
practiced bards, so your ears tweak a little at
the sound of imperfect music, but there is honesty

1926
01:55:33,122 --> 01:55:38,750
and joy coming from it, so you choose not to lend
any sort of constructive criticism to the

1927
01:55:38,750 --> 01:55:40,709
performers.

1928
01:55:40,709 --> 01:55:43,561
(laughter)

1929
01:55:43,561 --> 01:55:45,766
TALIESIN: You sent the last of the decent bards
out of town. It's all on you.

1930
01:55:45,766 --> 01:55:47,749
LAURA: Can I hang out outside? I want to keep my
eye on the skies.

1931
01:55:47,749 --> 01:55:49,667
MATT: Yeah, not a worry. Go ahead and make a
perception check.

1932
01:55:49,667 --> 01:55:54,813
TALIESIN: I was about to say I was going to join
you. I've had my fill of party.

1933
01:55:54,813 --> 01:56:00,988
LIAM: Yes, I'm sure you were.

1934
01:56:00,988 --> 01:56:03,194
LAURA: Wait, what is that? 32.

1935
01:56:03,194 --> 01:56:04,417
LIAM: That's okay.

1936
01:56:04,417 --> 01:56:12,880
MATT: 32? All right. You look about the sky. It is
clear. The dark clouds that had loomed towards the

1937
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:20,326
top of Gatshadow have since blown away. The starry
night sky now spreads infinitely above you, and

1938
01:56:20,326 --> 01:56:25,195
for the first time in a long time, knowing that
the immediate danger is no longer chasing you, you

1939
01:56:25,195 --> 01:56:31,113
take a minute to appreciate the sheer beauty of
the view that Westruun always had. This brief

1940
01:56:31,113 --> 01:56:38,517
moment to allow yourself to exhale helps remind
you what all this is worth, and the importance of

1941
01:56:38,517 --> 01:56:43,284
moments like this. You can hear the laughter
behind you within the inn. You can hear the music.

1942
01:56:43,284 --> 01:56:50,203
You can hear the kids chuckling and telling jokes.
People clinking glasses together. And in this tiny

1943
01:56:50,203 --> 01:56:57,692
little microcosm of a moment here, you let
yourself silently smile, and really know what all

1944
01:56:57,692 --> 01:56:59,285
of this is worth.

1945
01:56:59,285 --> 01:57:02,879
TALIESIN: I'm going to join--

1946
01:57:02,879 --> 01:57:07,887
MARISHA: About that time I reach and grab Percy's
hand before he leaves the door. Percy. Percy!

1947
01:57:07,887 --> 01:57:08,836
TALIESIN: What?

1948
01:57:08,836 --> 01:57:12,000
MARISHA: This is giving me a lot of anxiety.
There's a lot of people here.

1949
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,570
TALIESIN: Is it about your feelings about Vax? Is
that the whole problem right now?

1950
01:57:14,570 --> 01:57:15,659
MARISHA: No.

1951
01:57:15,659 --> 01:57:16,784
TALIESIN: I really don't--

1952
01:57:16,784 --> 01:57:18,076
MARISHA: There's so many people calling us heroes.

1953
01:57:18,076 --> 01:57:19,096
TALIESIN: Yes.

1954
01:57:19,096 --> 01:57:20,100
MARISHA: We're not heroes.

1955
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:22,316
TALIESIN: We pretty much are, actually. I hate to
tell you this.

1956
01:57:22,316 --> 01:57:27,102
MARISHA: No. We're not, we're terrible people.
We're terrible people. Why are they telling us

1957
01:57:27,102 --> 01:57:34,958
this? Oh, god. Oh, god, if I have to shake one
more townsperson's hand. Oh, god. I feel like I

1958
01:57:34,958 --> 01:57:40,303
was cursed. I was cursed. I don't want any of
this. I don't want any of this!

1959
01:57:40,303 --> 01:57:41,736
PATRICK: Do I spot that?

1960
01:57:41,736 --> 01:57:48,236
MATT: You do. As you guys are having this
conversation, Kerr walks over with a rosy grin on

1961
01:57:48,236 --> 01:57:49,526
his face.

1962
01:57:49,526 --> 01:57:53,877
PATRICK: Is this your first time?

1963
01:57:53,877 --> 01:58:05,936
MARISHA: (hyperventilating) Hi. I'm Keyleth. Do
you want to step outside?

1964
01:58:05,936 --> 01:58:07,620
LAURA: I come back inside.

1965
01:58:07,620 --> 01:58:08,871
PATRICK: Let's step outside.

1966
01:58:08,871 --> 01:58:10,034
MARISHA: Okay!

1967
01:58:10,034 --> 01:58:13,458
MATT: You guys pass Vex as she steps back into the
tavern, passing you guys.

1968
01:58:13,458 --> 01:58:16,305
LAURA: Pat her on the back. Drunk? Already?

1969
01:58:16,305 --> 01:58:17,709
MARISHA: No, not enough.

1970
01:58:17,709 --> 01:58:18,931
TALIESIN: Panic attack.

1971
01:58:18,931 --> 01:58:28,114
MATT: As you step outside with Kerr, the cold
night air comforting to you, hitting your face,

1972
01:58:28,114 --> 01:58:32,465
hitting your lungs. It helps the breathing slow,
and you have a moment of control over your

1973
01:58:32,465 --> 01:58:34,117
emotions.

1974
01:58:34,117 --> 01:58:40,273
MARISHA: (groan) Does the nausea always happen? Is
that always a thing?

1975
01:58:40,273 --> 01:58:54,011
PATRICK: Is it the people, or is it the fact that
you have finally realized how pointless it all is?

1976
01:58:54,011 --> 01:59:02,437
(surprised laughter)

1977
01:59:02,437 --> 01:59:12,045
MARISHA: Maybe it's the fact that I feel like I've
been lied to my entire god damn life, and it's all

1978
01:59:12,045 --> 01:59:15,020
crashing down upon me right now.

1979
01:59:15,020 --> 01:59:16,599
SAM: She's druish.

1980
01:59:16,599 --> 01:59:24,503
MARISHA: So druish. So yeah, you could say-- how
about a little bit of column A and a little bit of

1981
01:59:24,503 --> 01:59:25,943
column B?

1982
01:59:25,943 --> 01:59:27,081
PATRICK: Yeah.

1983
01:59:27,081 --> 01:59:28,153
MARISHA: Yeah.

1984
01:59:28,153 --> 01:59:29,259
PATRICK: Yeah.

1985
01:59:29,259 --> 01:59:33,176
MARISHA: Yeah. How did you deal with it?

1986
01:59:33,176 --> 01:59:39,524
PATRICK: I found other places where I could do
good things.

1987
01:59:39,524 --> 01:59:41,770
MARISHA: Really?

1988
01:59:41,770 --> 01:59:42,800
PATRICK: Yeah.

1989
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:43,888
MARISHA: Like what?

1990
01:59:43,888 --> 01:59:53,369
PATRICK: Like, I make wagon couples. The thing
that hooks--

1991
01:59:53,369 --> 01:59:55,254
MARISHA: Oh. I don't know exactly what you said.

1992
01:59:55,254 --> 01:59:56,318
PATRICK: You have a wagon.

1993
01:59:56,318 --> 01:59:57,373
MARISHA: Sure.

1994
01:59:57,373 --> 01:59:58,404
PATRICK: And then you have a horse.

1995
01:59:58,404 --> 01:59:59,385
MARISHA: Right, yeah.

1996
01:59:59,385 --> 02:00:02,125
PATRICK: And then something needs to hook the
horse to the wagon.

1997
02:00:02,125 --> 02:00:02,927
MARISHA: Got you.

1998
02:00:02,927 --> 02:00:09,520
PATRICK: And if you have a bad one of those, it
breaks, and so people need good ones of those.

1999
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:17,949
MARISHA: I don't know at all what you just told
me. I'm not going to lie. But I think I get the

2000
02:00:17,949 --> 02:00:19,239
message.

2001
02:00:19,239 --> 02:00:26,882
PATRICK: I'm guessing that you are bothered by the
fact that no matter what you do, you seem to end

2002
02:00:26,882 --> 02:00:29,730
up destroying more things than you fix.

2003
02:00:29,730 --> 02:00:33,468
MARISHA: Yes! Jeez, you're like the first person--
no one else gets it.

2004
02:00:33,468 --> 02:00:34,723
PATRICK: They don't get it, do they?

2005
02:00:34,723 --> 02:00:36,012
MARISHA: No, they don't.

2006
02:00:36,012 --> 02:00:37,207
PATRICK: No.

2007
02:00:37,207 --> 02:00:43,901
MARISHA: Is that it? That's it? We will destroy
everything we touch? We will cause more harm than

2008
02:00:43,901 --> 02:00:50,926
good? We will carve a path of destruction and make
it seem like we're doing good, and then people

2009
02:00:50,926 --> 02:00:56,391
will worship us because they think we're heroes,
when in the back of my head I'm thinking about all

2010
02:00:56,391 --> 02:01:00,429
the death that has come by our hands?

2011
02:01:00,429 --> 02:01:08,212
PATRICK: That can be a lot of it. I'm not going to
lie to you about that.

2012
02:01:08,212 --> 02:01:12,771
MARISHA: Yeah, you know, Kerr, you're not really
helping make me feel better about this. I'm not

2013
02:01:12,771 --> 02:01:14,134
going to lie.

2014
02:01:14,134 --> 02:01:22,990
PATRICK: Well I imagine that your friends will
tell you a lot of things that would make you feel

2015
02:01:22,990 --> 02:01:37,107
real good. But I'm not one for short term
solutions. I think that you're right. I think that

2016
02:01:37,107 --> 02:01:40,494
you've obviously put a lot of thought into this.

2017
02:01:40,494 --> 02:01:48,325
MARISHA: So much thought. I swear I've gotten
nosebleeds. Keep going. That's beside the point.

2018
02:01:48,325 --> 02:01:58,855
PATRICK: And I've known people like you before.
People who are very sensitive to this sort of

2019
02:01:58,855 --> 02:02:14,173
thing. I have been the sort of person you are. And
it's not simple. Your friend who lived here for a

2020
02:02:14,173 --> 02:02:16,744
while, the big one, what's his name?

2021
02:02:16,744 --> 02:02:18,972
MARISHA: Grog. Yeah.

2022
02:02:18,972 --> 02:02:24,910
PATRICK: Right. He doesn't have this. He has the
opposite of this. It's all good for him, right?

2023
02:02:24,910 --> 02:02:27,911
And you're kind of jealous, aren't you?

2024
02:02:27,911 --> 02:02:32,544
MARISHA: I so badly wish I could have what he
has.

2025
02:02:32,544 --> 02:02:39,693
PATRICK: But somebody has to look at the big
picture. And sometimes that's us, and usually it's

2026
02:02:39,693 --> 02:02:44,449
unpleasant. But somebody needs to do it.

2027
02:02:44,449 --> 02:02:47,901
MARISHA: So you're saying this is my curse? This
is my duty?

2028
02:02:47,901 --> 02:03:06,726
PATRICK: I'm saying that-- (long pause). I'm
saying that if you aren't careful, it will rip you

2029
02:03:06,726 --> 02:03:12,102
apart from the inside, but that's not a long-term
solution. That's just another piece of

2030
02:03:12,102 --> 02:03:25,074
destruction. You need to find a way to live with
the fact that you do what you can, because that's

2031
02:03:25,074 --> 02:03:33,029
what you can control. And sometimes bad things
happen anyway, and so you just have to decide

2032
02:03:33,029 --> 02:03:43,396
where you're going to pick your hill. You find
your hill. Everybody gets one hill, and you plant

2033
02:03:43,396 --> 02:03:48,574
your flag and you can die on that one. But you
have to be careful, because you only get one. If

2034
02:03:48,574 --> 02:03:54,839
you're really unlucky, you get more than one.

2035
02:03:54,839 --> 02:04:04,372
MARISHA: And what if the ultimate problem is that
I feel like I've had zero control from the start,

2036
02:04:04,372 --> 02:04:21,062
since birth? I didn't want any of this. I didn't
want my abilities. I didn't know I was special

2037
02:04:21,062 --> 02:04:33,839
until now. And I so desperately just want to be
normal. I want to go back to being ignorance and bliss.

2038
02:04:33,839 --> 02:04:42,440
PATRICK: Then I do have a momentary, short-term
solution for you.

2039
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:44,790
MARISHA: Shoot.

2040
02:04:44,790 --> 02:04:46,900
PATRICK: It's actually there, and I will get you
another one.

2041
02:04:46,900 --> 02:04:48,829
(laughter)

2042
02:04:48,829 --> 02:04:52,205
PATRICK: It will help a little bit for now. It
will smooth out some of the rough edges long

2043
02:04:52,205 --> 02:05:00,259
enough for us to talk for a while. Because I've
been down this road. Okay? The thing is, you're

2044
02:05:00,259 --> 02:05:03,783
not wrong, and you're not crazy, but it's not
hopeless, either.

2045
02:05:03,783 --> 02:05:09,183
MARISHA: Okay. Thank you.

2046
02:05:09,183 --> 02:05:11,923
PATRICK: I'll do maybe one of these. It feels like
she wants one of these.

2047
02:05:11,923 --> 02:05:15,335
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

2048
02:05:15,335 --> 02:05:16,787
PATRICK: I can read that.

2049
02:05:16,787 --> 02:05:20,487
MARISHA: I give in. Yeah. Yeah. You know, Kerr.

2050
02:05:20,487 --> 02:05:21,659
PATRICK: Yes?

2051
02:05:21,659 --> 02:05:25,027
MARISHA: Even surrounded--

2052
02:05:25,027 --> 02:05:29,921
SAM: He stabbed you in the back.

2053
02:05:29,921 --> 02:05:38,043
(laughter)

2054
02:05:38,043 --> 02:05:42,160
LIAM: The Chroma Conclave sends its regards!

2055
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:45,222
(laughter)

2056
02:05:45,222 --> 02:05:47,573
MARISHA: So Game of Thrones.

2057
02:05:47,573 --> 02:05:52,682
MATT: As he brings you into a warm hug, and at
first, there is the resistance because this is a

2058
02:05:52,682 --> 02:05:53,926
person you don't know.

2059
02:05:53,926 --> 02:05:55,656
MARISHA: Yeah, and my headdress is a little
wonky.

2060
02:05:55,656 --> 02:06:00,808
MATT: A little wonky due to the drink, due to not
concentrating. However, as much as you travel with

2061
02:06:00,808 --> 02:06:06,421
your friends, this stranger has seemingly come to
you with more wisdom and understanding of your

2062
02:06:06,421 --> 02:06:11,364
continuous predicaments than anybody has in a long
time, if at all, and you give into the hug and

2063
02:06:11,364 --> 02:06:14,112
realize just how nice it is to have somebody
understand.

2064
02:06:14,112 --> 02:06:18,835
MARISHA: I was pretty much going to say that in
character, but yeah, that's pretty much what I feel.

2065
02:06:18,835 --> 02:06:19,931
MATT: Sorry.

2066
02:06:19,931 --> 02:06:24,611
MARISHA: No, no, that's-- I wasn't-- Yeah. Yeah. I
tell Kern--

2067
02:06:24,611 --> 02:06:26,686
SAM: Kern?

2068
02:06:26,686 --> 02:06:28,128
MARISHA: Car. Kerr.

2069
02:06:28,128 --> 02:06:29,423
MATT: Somewhere in that neighborhood.

2070
02:06:29,423 --> 02:06:39,068
MARISHA: Care Bear. I tell Kerr, even surrounded
by friends, I often feel so alone. Thank you for

2071
02:06:39,068 --> 02:06:44,452
being a friend, even though we just met.

2072
02:06:44,452 --> 02:06:46,468
PATRICK: I get that.

2073
02:06:46,468 --> 02:06:52,430
MATT: He brings you in. Gets you another drink.

2074
02:06:52,430 --> 02:06:54,672
PATRICK: Actually, I'll bring another drink out to
her.

2075
02:06:54,672 --> 02:06:55,930
MATT: Oh, perfect. All right.

2076
02:06:55,930 --> 02:06:57,413
MARISHA: It's crowded inside.

2077
02:06:57,413 --> 02:06:59,540
TALIESIN: I stumble outside for a bit as well at
this point.

2078
02:06:59,540 --> 02:07:07,231
SAM: Meanwhile, I'm telling my table a story about
how I won a cannonball contest last night.

2079
02:07:07,231 --> 02:07:12,590
MATT: They are enraptured.

2080
02:07:12,590 --> 02:07:16,524
SAM: It was in a dragon's lair! I was amazing.

2081
02:07:16,524 --> 02:07:19,730
(laughter)

2082
02:07:19,730 --> 02:07:23,797
LAURA: Is Amelia awake at this point?

2083
02:07:23,797 --> 02:07:27,511
MATT: Amelia has woken up due to the sound and
noise, and she's wandering about with a drink in

2084
02:07:27,511 --> 02:07:28,926
her hand now.

2085
02:07:28,926 --> 02:07:34,294
ASHLEY: All right. We'll walk over to her.

2086
02:07:34,294 --> 02:07:36,399
TRAVIS: I'll stay with you, but just behind you.

2087
02:07:36,399 --> 02:07:42,399
LAURA: Amelia?

2088
02:07:42,399 --> 02:07:53,467
MATT: "Hi, yes! Thank you again for releasing me
from the terrible stocks. I really appreciate

2089
02:07:53,467 --> 02:07:56,615
"that. Thank you for everything you've done for
Westruun."

2090
02:07:56,615 --> 02:08:02,437
LAURA: Well, thank you for everything you've done.
I've heard amazing things about you and your

2091
02:08:02,437 --> 02:08:03,826
family.

2092
02:08:03,826 --> 02:08:11,795
MATT: "We're meager folk. We come from very simple
roots. I--" And she takes a big, long sip of her

2093
02:08:11,795 --> 02:08:21,626
flagon, sets it down on the table and wipes her
mouth. "Truth be told, I-- as soon as I saw that

2094
02:08:21,626 --> 02:08:30,560
"dragon, I ran straight away. I didn't-- You guys
are the heroes. I didn't do anything."

2095
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:32,515
LAURA: I sit down next to her.

2096
02:08:32,515 --> 02:08:42,122
ASHLEY: I sit down next to her, too. (whispers)
Should we just wait till the morning?

2097
02:08:42,122 --> 02:08:53,840
LAURA: We have to do it right now. So. We knew--
your father is Reginald.

2098
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:58,254
MATT: "Yes. Have you seen him?"

2099
02:08:58,254 --> 02:09:13,927
LAURA: Yes. He-- I take her hands. One of the
bravest men I've ever had the honor of meeting.

2100
02:09:13,927 --> 02:09:26,323
MATT: There's recognition in her eyes. Her head
pulls back a bit. Her expression goes stoic as she

2101
02:09:26,323 --> 02:09:30,987
sinks in the wordless reality that you've just
bestowed upon her.

2102
02:09:30,987 --> 02:09:46,322
LAURA: I know this can be-- I know how hard this
is to hear. But none of this would have happened,

2103
02:09:46,322 --> 02:09:56,258
none of this celebration would be possible without
him. He sacrificed himself, so that all of us

2104
02:09:56,258 --> 02:10:08,099
could live, and he spoke your name in the end. He
wanted nothing more than for you to be taken care of.

2105
02:10:08,099 --> 02:10:19,851
MATT: (long pause) "That sounds like Dad." Wipes
her eyes.

2106
02:10:19,851 --> 02:10:28,899
LAURA: Would you like to pray, Pike?

2107
02:10:28,899 --> 02:10:35,123
ASHLEY: I don't know if you're a woman of faith,
but--

2108
02:10:35,123 --> 02:10:38,891
MATT: "What faith do you belong to?"

2109
02:10:38,891 --> 02:10:42,667
ASHLEY: I follow Sarenrae.

2110
02:10:42,667 --> 02:10:49,483
MATT: "Then, for the night, as do I." She reaches
over and takes her flagon, and the tears are

2111
02:10:49,483 --> 02:10:59,023
streaming down her face in spite of her smile, and
she looks to you both, and looks to you. "To

2112
02:10:59,023 --> 02:11:01,758
"Reginald. To Dad."

2113
02:11:01,758 --> 02:11:03,916
TRAVIS: To Reggie.

2114
02:11:03,916 --> 02:11:05,195
ASHLEY: To Reggie.

2115
02:11:05,195 --> 02:11:11,616
MATT: And she starts weeping into her hands.

2116
02:11:11,616 --> 02:11:18,864
TRAVIS: Amelia. You should also know, your father
was a man of a few tricks. He told us that he had

2117
02:11:18,864 --> 02:11:25,774
been saving this up for whenever you were old
enough, but I think you should have it now. I hand

2118
02:11:25,774 --> 02:11:28,115
her 400 gold pieces.

2119
02:11:28,115 --> 02:11:36,581
MATT: She looks up for a moment. "How? How did--
they took everything."

2120
02:11:36,581 --> 02:11:38,722
LAURA: He hid it.

2121
02:11:38,722 --> 02:11:57,181
MATT: "This could help a lot of us. Okay."

2122
02:11:57,181 --> 02:12:01,413
TRAVIS: I think he knew you would do well with
it.

2123
02:12:01,413 --> 02:12:11,735
LAURA: Dear, there's more coming to the town. You
take care of yourself.

2124
02:12:11,735 --> 02:12:18,130
MATT: (deep breath) "We'll take care of each
other. I think that's what he'd want."

2125
02:12:18,130 --> 02:12:20,256
TRAVIS: Aye.

2126
02:12:20,256 --> 02:12:25,300
MATT: She grabs her flagon again and takes a big
old sip, sets it down. Her eyes are dried a little

2127
02:12:25,300 --> 02:12:26,802
bit. She wipes the last away.

2128
02:12:26,802 --> 02:12:28,584
TRAVIS: I pour my flagon into hers.

2129
02:12:28,584 --> 02:12:35,085
MATT: She laughs and drinks of it again.
Definitely embraced the idea that she's going to

2130
02:12:35,085 --> 02:12:41,790
get really drunk tonight. She begins joining in,
singing with the music. And the rest of the party

2131
02:12:41,790 --> 02:12:50,426
picks up as the celebration once again fills the
air. The rest of the folks gathering around.

2132
02:12:50,426 --> 02:12:54,894
(birds tweeting) Don't know why there were birds
in that track.

2133
02:12:54,894 --> 02:12:57,309
(laughter)

2134
02:12:57,309 --> 02:12:58,901
ASHLEY: Is it morning?

2135
02:12:58,901 --> 02:13:03,061
MATT: There will be a lot of partying through the
night, so probably it's an eventuality. However,

2136
02:13:03,061 --> 02:13:07,753
we will take this moment to take a quick break to
the restroom. We will return here for the next bit

2137
02:13:07,753 --> 02:13:12,213
of this adventure, so we'll be right back here in
a few minutes, guys. Stick around.

2138
02:13:12,213 --> 02:13:13,826
(cheering)

2139
02:13:13,826 --> 02:28:47,473
[break]

2140
02:28:47,473 --> 02:28:58,375
MATT: Welcome back. So as you return here, bellies
full, the evening of drinks, rabble-rousing, and

2141
02:28:58,375 --> 02:29:04,971
stress release through conversation and laughter
carries through until the morning light comes.

2142
02:29:04,971 --> 02:29:12,976
Everyone wakes up extremely hungover, but in a way
that is well-earned and still worthy of the

2143
02:29:12,976 --> 02:29:18,772
evening that transpired before it. You all come to
consciousness, about midday at this time now.

2144
02:29:18,772 --> 02:29:19,830
LAURA: Whoa.

2145
02:29:19,830 --> 02:29:21,813
MATT: You all slept in after what happened.

2146
02:29:21,813 --> 02:29:24,279
LIAM: I actually spent the night in a field with
Reginald.

2147
02:29:24,279 --> 02:29:25,307
SAM: Ew.

2148
02:29:25,307 --> 02:29:26,488
MATT: You did.

2149
02:29:26,488 --> 02:29:31,907
LIAM: That's your brain, man. I sat next to his
body, waiting for people to come back, they never

2150
02:29:31,907 --> 02:29:36,684
did. I piled some of Keyleth's flowers on his
chest, and then I fell asleep, in the field, six

2151
02:29:36,684 --> 02:29:38,941
feet away from him. Party!

2152
02:29:38,941 --> 02:29:41,168
MARISHA: Did you think we were going to--

2153
02:29:41,168 --> 02:29:42,508
LIAM: Yeah, well.

2154
02:29:42,508 --> 02:29:43,575
MARISHA: Never mind.

2155
02:29:43,575 --> 02:29:44,551
LIAM: I don't know.

2156
02:29:44,551 --> 02:29:45,390
LAURA: Oh. Shit.

2157
02:29:45,390 --> 02:29:46,803
LIAM: I don't know what I thought, but that's what
I did.

2158
02:29:46,803 --> 02:29:48,217
LAURA: Why didn't you check up on the earring,
dude?

2159
02:29:48,217 --> 02:29:49,470
LIAM: I wanted some space.

2160
02:29:49,470 --> 02:29:56,168
MATT: So as you all come around to the breakfast
morning, food is being cooked up within the

2161
02:29:56,168 --> 02:30:02,338
kitchen by some of the various villagers that have
taken up to help out with what they can in the area.

2162
02:30:02,338 --> 02:30:07,493
You start realizing that Vax is nowhere
to be found and as this conversation begins to

2163
02:30:07,493 --> 02:30:17,072
progress, he eventually finds you guys and waltzes
into the groaning room of semi-conscious Westruun

2164
02:30:17,072 --> 02:30:18,520
denizens.

2165
02:30:18,520 --> 02:30:20,828
LAURA: (yawns) Where were you?

2166
02:30:20,828 --> 02:30:25,001
LIAM: Getting a good night's sleep on a field of
grass. How are you doing?

2167
02:30:25,001 --> 02:30:26,501
MARISHA: We had a bender.

2168
02:30:26,501 --> 02:30:27,752
LIAM: You need some water?

2169
02:30:27,752 --> 02:30:28,818
MARISHA: Yeah.

2170
02:30:28,818 --> 02:30:29,875
LIAM: Can you make some?

2171
02:30:29,875 --> 02:30:32,700
LAURA: In that endless jug? Or does it only
make beer and mayonnaise?

2172
02:30:32,700 --> 02:30:34,658
MARISHA: Say water to the endless jug.

2173
02:30:34,658 --> 02:30:36,237
TRAVIS: Yeah, it makes water.

2174
02:30:36,237 --> 02:30:38,006
SAM: It seems like a waste.

2175
02:30:38,006 --> 02:30:40,652
TRAVIS: Give me water like the ocean!

2176
02:30:40,652 --> 02:30:41,919
SAM: Oh, no, no, no!

2177
02:30:41,919 --> 02:30:43,141
TALIESIN: No!

2178
02:30:43,141 --> 02:30:46,237
MATT: The jug is now filled with water to the
top.

2179
02:30:46,237 --> 02:30:47,731
TRAVIS: Yeah, look! Water.

2180
02:30:47,731 --> 02:30:49,043
LAURA: Is it saltwater?

2181
02:30:49,043 --> 02:30:50,774
MARISHA: I dip my finger in and take a taste.

2182
02:30:50,774 --> 02:30:51,815
MATT: It is saltwater.

2183
02:30:51,815 --> 02:30:53,367
LAURA: (groans) Damn it, Grog.

2184
02:30:53,367 --> 02:30:54,361
TRAVIS: Did I do it wrong?

2185
02:30:54,361 --> 02:30:55,716
SAM: You did it wrong.

2186
02:30:55,716 --> 02:30:59,210
TALIESIN: You should try that, though. See if you
like it.

2187
02:30:59,210 --> 02:31:01,972
TRAVIS: Is there anybody else sleeping in the
room?

2188
02:31:01,972 --> 02:31:08,360
MATT: There are a few folks that are probably still sleeping
off the drinking, but I'd say the majority of the

2189
02:31:08,360 --> 02:31:10,312
folks have woken up in various states of
grogginess.

2190
02:31:10,312 --> 02:31:13,148
TRAVIS: (whispers) Hey, should we wake up the rest
of the people with this?

2191
02:31:13,148 --> 02:31:17,951
SAM: The people who've lost their city? You're going
to prank them?

2192
02:31:17,951 --> 02:31:20,441
TRAVIS: Well, I'm feeling a bit salty this
morning.

2193
02:31:20,441 --> 02:31:23,158
(laughter)

2194
02:31:23,158 --> 02:31:28,647
TRAVIS: I go outside and I dump it.

2195
02:31:28,647 --> 02:31:34,242
MARISHA: I cast a Create Water spell so we can all
have some water.

2196
02:31:34,242 --> 02:31:35,164
MATT: Okay.

2197
02:31:35,164 --> 02:31:37,927
LAURA: We should probably call everyone 
in the town to talk.

2198
02:31:37,927 --> 02:31:42,482
MARISHA: Yeah, we should have a big meeting, let
them decide what they want to do with the rest

2199
02:31:42,482 --> 02:31:45,299
of their fucking lives.

2200
02:31:45,345 --> 02:31:48,890
TALIESIN: What did you have to drink last night?

2201
02:31:48,890 --> 02:31:53,866
LAURA: Is there a bartender or somebody that's
running the inn that everyone's staying at? Or is it kind

2202
02:31:53,866 --> 02:31:54,856
of makeshift--

2203
02:31:54,856 --> 02:31:58,094
MATT: It's just kind of makeshift. However,
whoever who once ran this place is no longer

2204
02:31:58,094 --> 02:32:02,421
here, probably left with the first or second wave
of evacuees. Everyone here is just kind of doing

2205
02:32:02,421 --> 02:32:04,130
their part to keep it going.

2206
02:32:04,200 --> 02:32:09,203
LAURA: Can I grab someone nearby that looks like
they're up and about and actually accomplishing things?

2207
02:32:09,203 --> 02:32:13,585
MATT: Yeah. There's an older woman who did not
drink but just was around last evening who's done most of

2208
02:32:13,585 --> 02:32:16,512
the cleaning-- and even though there's no reason to
clean, she's still just kind of going through the

2209
02:32:16,512 --> 02:32:19,750
motions of wiping down the counters and putting things
away properly.

2210
02:32:19,750 --> 02:32:21,350
LAURA: Dear heart, um--

2211
02:32:21,350 --> 02:32:22,612
MATT: "Yes?"

2212
02:32:22,612 --> 02:32:26,713
LAURA: Could you spread the word that there's
going to be a town meeting?

2213
02:32:26,713 --> 02:32:28,730
MATT: "A town meeting? What for?"

2214
02:32:28,730 --> 02:32:31,730
LAURA: So we can talk about how to keep everyone
safe, dear.

2215
02:32:31,730 --> 02:32:33,389
MATT: "All right."

2216
02:32:33,389 --> 02:32:37,597
LAURA: Yes. As soon as possible, can everyone meet
here?

2217
02:32:37,597 --> 02:32:39,138
SAM: No, the central--

2218
02:32:39,138 --> 02:32:40,567
LAURA: In the center of town.

2219
02:32:40,567 --> 02:32:42,908
SAM: Where we killed Kevdak.

2220
02:32:42,908 --> 02:32:47,665
LAURA: Where the goliaths, where the barbarians--
sorry, Grog-- where all the mean people were.

2221
02:32:47,665 --> 02:32:54,068
MATT: "All right, I'll get the word out." And she
puts away a couple of towels and grabs a couple of

2222
02:32:54,068 --> 02:32:58,481
people near her, and the three of them saunter out
into the main walkway.

2223
02:32:58,481 --> 02:33:02,942
SAM: Also, I don't know if he remembers, but
sometime in our revelry last night, I asked Kerr

2224
02:33:02,942 --> 02:33:09,685
if he could-- I gave him a sheath, just a sheath
of a sword-- and I asked him if he could make just

2225
02:33:09,685 --> 02:33:15,407
a little-- there's some metal components to
it-- I was asking him if he could just make a

2226
02:33:15,407 --> 02:33:22,775
little secret compartment on it. Like a place that
you could hide a little vial or a little powder or

2227
02:33:22,775 --> 02:33:26,938
a little note or something, just in the side of
the sheath.

2228
02:33:26,938 --> 02:33:29,879
PATRICK: What are the odds that I would make a
total hash of that?

2229
02:33:29,879 --> 02:33:34,398
(laughter)

2230
02:33:34,398 --> 02:33:36,692
PATRICK: I'm imagining I don't do that much
delicate work.

2231
02:33:36,692 --> 02:33:39,071
MATT: No. But also, how much did you drink last
night?

2232
02:33:39,071 --> 02:33:42,126
PATRICK: Oh, right! Yeah, I can totally do that.

2233
02:33:42,126 --> 02:33:44,950
MATT: So, how much-- how drunk were you?

2234
02:33:44,950 --> 02:33:56,617
PATRICK: You know, I probably was pretty modest.
I probably drank with her, to be social. And then

2235
02:33:56,617 --> 02:34:02,278
I probably just kind of prowled and made sure
nothing got out of hand and everyone was okay.

2236
02:34:02,278 --> 02:34:09,370
Yeah, I probably-- I'll take a shot at it. How
attached to this sheath are you?

2237
02:34:09,370 --> 02:34:11,260
TALIESIN: (snickers)

2238
02:34:11,260 --> 02:34:12,534
SAM: Yes. Extremely.

2239
02:34:12,534 --> 02:34:13,438
PATRICK: Extremely.

2240
02:34:13,438 --> 02:34:14,786
(laughter)

2241
02:34:14,786 --> 02:34:16,104
PATRICK: I'll see what I can do.

2242
02:34:16,104 --> 02:34:18,468
LIAM: Just nail a sock on the side of it, it'll be
great.

2243
02:34:18,536 --> 02:34:19,900
(laughter)

2244
02:34:19,900 --> 02:34:21,532
SAM: I don't make the best decisions.

2245
02:34:21,532 --> 02:34:26,538
MATT: Especially while drinking. You find your way
back to your forge, which is still functional. It

2246
02:34:26,538 --> 02:34:33,686
was not one of the buildings that fell on the
initial attack. You heat it up late into the

2247
02:34:33,686 --> 02:34:39,640
evening. It doesn't require a lot because it's
smaller work. Go ahead and make a blacksmithing

2248
02:34:39,716 --> 02:34:46,812
check with your proficiency bonus. Plus, with
this, it would be dexterity. Because it's very,

2249
02:34:46,812 --> 02:34:48,323
very minute work.

2250
02:34:48,323 --> 02:34:49,835
SAM: Could I have inspired him?

2251
02:34:49,835 --> 02:34:51,929
MATT: You could. Yes! You can very much do that.

2252
02:34:51,929 --> 02:34:55,243
SAM: I will give him a limerick to inspire him with.

2253
02:34:55,243 --> 02:34:57,508
MATT: Drunken Scanlan limerick, here we go!

2254
02:34:57,508 --> 02:35:06,709
SAM: Have you heard the legend of Shale? One eye,
elderly, frail? To a black dragon, she told, "You

2255
02:35:06,709 --> 02:35:11,713
"may be ancient, but I'm old!" And somehow lived to
tell the tale.

2256
02:35:11,713 --> 02:35:13,863
(cheering)

2257
02:35:13,863 --> 02:35:17,500
MATT: Go and take your d10 inspiration dice, if
you want to add that to the roll.

2258
02:35:17,581 --> 02:35:25,888
PATRICK: All right. So, just proficiency bonus--

2259
02:35:25,888 --> 02:35:27,579
MATT: Plus your dex bonus.

2260
02:35:27,579 --> 02:35:32,010
PATRICK: Yeah, my vast dex bonus. 16.

2261
02:35:32,010 --> 02:35:39,239
MATT: 16. That's not bad. It's not the finest
craftsmanship in the world, and what once was a

2262
02:35:39,393 --> 02:35:49,040
very, very beautifully detailed sheath to a
weapon now has a somewhat hammered, dented

2263
02:35:49,040 --> 02:35:55,072
element to it that you probably want to hide with
a silk or something. It's an imperfection in what

2264
02:35:55,072 --> 02:35:59,024
was a previously a perfect element, but it is
functional. It is a small compartment that

2265
02:35:59,024 --> 02:36:07,409
actually has a tiny metal slot that can be moved
closed or open with your thumb.

2266
02:36:07,409 --> 02:36:08,135
SAM: Great!

2267
02:36:08,135 --> 02:36:11,099
MATT: It's functional. It's not pretty, but it is
functional.

2268
02:36:11,099 --> 02:36:12,961
PATRICK: We focus on function here.

2269
02:36:12,961 --> 02:36:20,027
SAM: I understand. Thank you for your nimble
fingers. Next time, I'll ask Percy to do it.

2270
02:36:20,027 --> 02:36:23,782
(laughter)

2271
02:36:23,782 --> 02:36:26,494
TALIESIN: And it will explode.

2272
02:36:26,494 --> 02:36:33,735
MARISHA: I make a tonic out of the glissfoil
that I had in my pouch from the garden back in

2273
02:36:33,735 --> 02:36:36,867
Emon. Pass it out, a little hangover tonic.

2274
02:36:36,867 --> 02:36:38,632
MATT: It does help, actually.

2275
02:36:38,632 --> 02:36:40,963
LAURA: All of us?

2276
02:36:40,963 --> 02:36:42,111
MARISHA: Yeah.

2277
02:36:42,111 --> 02:36:43,242
LAURA: Sweet!

2278
02:36:43,242 --> 02:36:46,755
MARISHA: Just a little crushed herbs and water,
like a tea.

2279
02:36:46,755 --> 02:36:48,335
TRAVIS: A little hair of the dog, huh?

2280
02:36:48,335 --> 02:36:49,481
LAURA: Thanks, Kiki!

2281
02:36:49,481 --> 02:36:50,920
TRAVIS: Are we day drinking?

2282
02:36:50,920 --> 02:36:56,266
SAM: Also, before we go to the meeting, I haven't
used it in a while but I would like to use my

2283
02:36:56,266 --> 02:37:05,274
Scrying Potion to-- not potion! The scry that I
left at our Greyskull Keep so long ago, to kind

2284
02:37:05,274 --> 02:37:07,283
of see what's going on at Greyskull.

2285
02:37:07,283 --> 02:37:08,460
TALIESIN: Your scry pie?

2286
02:37:08,460 --> 02:37:09,682
SAM: Yeah.

2287
02:37:09,682 --> 02:37:16,784
MATT: Glancing at it this moment now, and it's about
midday, you concentrate on what you left

2288
02:37:16,784 --> 02:37:18,193
behind.

2289
02:37:18,193 --> 02:37:19,995
SAM: Yep. We all know what it was.

2290
02:37:19,995 --> 02:37:24,904
MATT: You have a brief view, a small windowed view
of the kitchen before you. It seems to be

2291
02:37:24,904 --> 02:37:26,769
currently empty.

2292
02:37:26,769 --> 02:37:28,434
SAM: But still standing?

2293
02:37:28,434 --> 02:37:36,511
MATT: But still standing. You do notice, in the
sink there are some fresh dishes.

2294
02:37:36,511 --> 02:37:39,628
SAM: Oh! Okay.

2295
02:37:39,628 --> 02:37:41,217
TALIESIN: Squatters.

2296
02:37:41,217 --> 02:37:42,803
MARISHA: It's fucking squatters.

2297
02:37:42,803 --> 02:37:44,618
SAM: Or maybe our staff.

2298
02:37:44,618 --> 02:37:46,716
TALIESIN: Unpaid now, so now they're squatters.

2299
02:37:46,716 --> 02:37:48,770
SAM: Okay.

2300
02:37:48,770 --> 02:37:51,046
MATT: (laughs) It's an important distinction.

2301
02:37:51,046 --> 02:37:53,270
TRAVIS: Can you talk through your poop?

2302
02:37:53,270 --> 02:37:59,697
SAM: No, no. Poo doesn't work that way, Travis.
It's a one-way street.

2303
02:37:59,697 --> 02:38:01,403
TRAVIS: The finer points are lost on me.

2304
02:38:01,403 --> 02:38:03,517
ASHLEY: You left it in the kitchen?

2305
02:38:03,517 --> 02:38:06,999
SAM: I left it in a jar in the kitchen and I told
the people not to open it.

2306
02:38:06,999 --> 02:38:11,093
MARISHA: We only got a C on our general
inspection rating.

2307
02:38:11,093 --> 02:38:15,093
(laughter)

2308
02:38:15,093 --> 02:38:21,217
MATT: There's a parchment that's just nailed to
the outside of the keep. At least it's good

2309
02:38:21,217 --> 02:38:28,688
calligraphy. All right, so unless you have
anything else to prepare in this time, most of the

2310
02:38:28,688 --> 02:38:33,104
townsfolk are beginning to converge towards the
square in the central-southern region of Westruun

2311
02:38:33,104 --> 02:38:37,987
where you had the showdown battle with Kevdak
outside of the Margrave's home. The now deceased

2312
02:38:37,987 --> 02:38:43,111
Margrave. Everyone seems to have gathered together
and there is an air of tension. As you approach,

2313
02:38:43,111 --> 02:38:49,129
as folks are muttering to themselves, then it
gets quiet as you all step into the central area.

2314
02:38:49,129 --> 02:38:55,482
There is still-- it's been pulled over, it was
partially damaged before, but there is a

2315
02:38:55,482 --> 02:39:05,443
large elevated platform that was used for
speeches or celebration elements that has been,

2316
02:39:05,443 --> 02:39:11,974
for the time being, fixed to allow you guys to
stand up if you wish to address the rest of the folks.

2317
02:39:11,974 --> 02:39:17,110
LAURA: Who wants to talk? Scanlan? You're so
charismatic.

2318
02:39:17,110 --> 02:39:19,229
TALIESIN: What are we going to say?

2319
02:39:19,229 --> 02:39:22,528
SAM: I'm still reading my book. But, yes, we're
just going to ask them a question.

2320
02:39:22,613 --> 02:39:25,628
LAURA: I think we need to ask them where they want
to go.

2321
02:39:25,628 --> 02:39:28,412
TALIESIN: And if they ask what we think?

2322
02:39:28,412 --> 02:39:31,406
SAM: We don't think anything. We'll support their
decision, right?

2323
02:39:31,406 --> 02:39:32,461
TALIESIN: I think something.

2324
02:39:32,461 --> 02:39:33,875
SAM: What do you think?

2325
02:39:33,875 --> 02:39:40,448
MARISHA: I guess I could talk to them?

2326
02:39:40,448 --> 02:39:57,777
TALIESIN: I would like to build-- The death of a city
is such a blasphemy. It is the murder of the dead. And

2327
02:39:57,777 --> 02:39:59,974
I'm horrified.

2328
02:39:59,974 --> 02:40:06,523
MARISHA: Percy, a city is nothing without living
people in it. A city is made up of the people that

2329
02:40:06,523 --> 02:40:08,040
live inside of it.

2330
02:40:08,040 --> 02:40:09,022
TALIESIN: It is.

2331
02:40:09,022 --> 02:40:10,872
MARISHA: We have to protect them first.

2332
02:40:10,872 --> 02:40:14,213
LIAM: Percival's suggesting letting them live here,
building something for them underground--

2333
02:40:14,213 --> 02:40:16,495
MARISHA: Which we can facilitate?

2334
02:40:16,495 --> 02:40:17,965
LIAM: Rather than running.

2335
02:40:17,965 --> 02:40:20,726
SAM: We have a lot of other things to do-- let's
talk to them.

2336
02:40:20,726 --> 02:40:23,823
TRAVIS: How about Pike talks to them?

2337
02:40:23,823 --> 02:40:25,123
ASHLEY: Me?!

2338
02:40:25,123 --> 02:40:26,717
TRAVIS: Yeah! You were born here.

2339
02:40:26,717 --> 02:40:28,863
LAURA: This is true! Pike? They know you.

2340
02:40:28,863 --> 02:40:32,471
ASHLEY: (sighs) Well, I'm not very charismatic.

2341
02:40:32,471 --> 02:40:34,089
SAM: I'll be with you.

2342
02:40:34,089 --> 02:40:35,583
TRAVIS: But you're genuine.

2343
02:40:35,583 --> 02:40:37,033
ASHLEY: Do you want to help me?

2344
02:40:37,033 --> 02:40:38,951
LIAM: Exactly. You are genuine.

2345
02:40:38,951 --> 02:40:43,458
ASHLEY: So we're telling them-- asking them if
they want to stay. And if they do stay, that we

2346
02:40:43,458 --> 02:40:47,695
could built them shelter.

2347
02:40:47,695 --> 02:40:50,711
LAURA: Help them take shelter in the sewers. If
there's danger.

2348
02:40:50,711 --> 02:40:53,424
TRAVIS: The dragon's dead. We don't know if
another one will come.

2349
02:40:53,424 --> 02:40:59,460
LAURA: Can we ask before we go up on the stage if
Kerr, if you're willing to help, should they want

2350
02:40:59,460 --> 02:41:01,765
that? Is that something you could help us with?

2351
02:41:01,765 --> 02:41:11,889
PATRICK: I would be delighted to help facilitate
things between you and the community. I know a

2352
02:41:11,889 --> 02:41:18,703
lot of people that have left will return. I don't
doubt that for a second. But right now, everyone

2353
02:41:18,703 --> 02:41:24,126
is scattered and scared. And a lot of families
have been separated. A lot of people who would

2354
02:41:24,126 --> 02:41:33,693
love to return here and rebuild the city, they
don't know where their loved ones are. And I know

2355
02:41:33,693 --> 02:41:42,788
that is preying on their minds more than their own
safety, in some cases. I know most people are

2356
02:41:42,788 --> 02:41:53,793
looking to leave and come back eventually. And
depending on the resources, like what you've

2357
02:41:53,793 --> 02:42:06,928
generously offered from the caves-- that will
keep them from being refugees. They can continue

2358
02:42:06,928 --> 02:42:12,796
to be a community in this other town, and then
return, well-organized and with resources to build

2359
02:42:12,796 --> 02:42:20,891
it. (sighs) I don't feel they're ready to do it
here and now, though. I don't feel they're excited

2360
02:42:20,891 --> 02:42:27,251
about that. I know that so many of them have
people from their lives they're just missing.

2361
02:42:27,251 --> 02:42:31,474
TRAVIS: And by the way, it's going to be a hot
second before the carts come back from the cave, right?

2362
02:42:31,474 --> 02:42:32,889
PATRICK: Yeah. Probably--

2363
02:42:32,889 --> 02:42:36,175
MATT: Another day or two before they arrive, yeah.

2364
02:42:36,175 --> 02:42:39,412
MARISHA: Can we even say that these people are in--

2365
02:42:39,412 --> 02:42:41,432
ASHLEY: So are you thinking they won't want to
stay, then?

2366
02:42:41,432 --> 02:42:46,532
PATRICK: I know from speaking to a lot of people
over the last couple of days, and even speaking to

2367
02:42:46,532 --> 02:42:54,955
them last night, they're relieved that the dragon
is gone. But they're worried about more in the

2368
02:42:54,955 --> 02:43:04,285
future. But primarily, they're looking to be safe
now, and reunite with their friends and family,

2369
02:43:04,285 --> 02:43:06,642
and most of those people are in--?

2370
02:43:06,642 --> 02:43:07,510
MATT: Kymal.

2371
02:43:07,510 --> 02:43:08,490
PATRICK: Kymal.

2372
02:43:08,490 --> 02:43:15,296
LIAM: I think we give them a choice. But I
think, Pike, I think it's a good idea. I think you

2373
02:43:15,296 --> 02:43:21,084
present the idea of staying and getting word to
the people in Kymal that some of their loved ones

2374
02:43:21,084 --> 02:43:26,111
are still here, still living. The dragon is dead.
Summon them back to rebuild.

2375
02:43:26,111 --> 02:43:27,511
LAURA: How far away is Kymal?

2376
02:43:27,511 --> 02:43:30,335
SAM: Two days' travel.

2377
02:43:30,335 --> 02:43:32,644
TRAVIS: Wow. Fucking Shorthalt!

2378
02:43:32,644 --> 02:43:33,982
ASHLEY: How do you know?

2379
02:43:33,982 --> 02:43:36,139
LAURA: Was that in your book?

2380
02:43:36,139 --> 02:43:37,497
SAM: My girl is there.

2381
02:43:37,497 --> 02:43:39,627
LAURA: Your daughter's in Kymal?

2382
02:43:39,627 --> 02:43:41,998
SAM: Yes. I'll be going there anyway.

2383
02:43:41,998 --> 02:43:43,589
TRAVIS: Haylie? Maylie?

2384
02:43:43,589 --> 02:43:44,679
SAM: Kaylie.

2385
02:43:44,679 --> 02:43:45,940
MARISHA: And Kymal hasn't been hit yet?

2386
02:43:45,940 --> 02:43:47,190
TALIESIN: Not yet.

2387
02:43:47,190 --> 02:43:50,687
LIAM: Is Kymal bigger or smaller than Westruun?

2388
02:43:50,687 --> 02:43:52,065
MATT: It's smaller than Westruun.

2389
02:43:52,065 --> 02:43:53,301
LAURA: Well--

2390
02:43:53,301 --> 02:43:54,878
LIAM: They're better off in Westruun.

2391
02:43:54,878 --> 02:44:01,692
MARISHA: I'm afraid with each refugee we add to
another city, we're only making it a larger

2392
02:44:01,692 --> 02:44:02,639
target.

2393
02:44:02,639 --> 02:44:07,807
TALIESIN: Which is why-- (sighs) There is no safe
harbor right now.

2394
02:44:07,807 --> 02:44:09,963
MARISHA: And there's no point in rebuilding--

2395
02:44:09,963 --> 02:44:10,930
TALIESIN: There is.

2396
02:44:10,930 --> 02:44:12,064
MARISHA: Why?

2397
02:44:12,064 --> 02:44:14,251
TALIESIN: Because this is civilization. This is--

2398
02:44:14,251 --> 02:44:18,279
MARISHA: There's no point in rebuilding right now
when there's still three other dragons who will

2399
02:44:18,279 --> 02:44:20,802
only come and go, 'Stomp, stomp, stomp! Dead!'

2400
02:44:20,802 --> 02:44:21,889
TRAVIS: They might.

2401
02:44:21,889 --> 02:44:23,003
TALIESIN: They might.

2402
02:44:23,003 --> 02:44:24,494
MARISHA: They. Will.

2403
02:44:24,494 --> 02:44:27,831
TALIESIN: No, they might. We don't know they
will.

2404
02:44:27,831 --> 02:44:29,984
PATRICK: If you were a dragon, what would you do?

2405
02:44:29,984 --> 02:44:36,885
TALIESIN: I would hit the city where all the refugees
are going. Because it would hurt more. I would not

2406
02:44:36,885 --> 02:44:42,017
hit the city that's going to take 200 years to be a
shadow of its former self.

2407
02:44:42,017 --> 02:44:49,520
MARISHA: Yes, but you're also not a vain dragon
who just had one of its allies taken out in this

2408
02:44:49,520 --> 02:44:54,468
very city. These dragons are going to have a huge
vendetta against Westruun now.

2409
02:44:54,468 --> 02:44:58,464
TALIESIN: I may not have lost an ally, but I am a
vain dragon.

2410
02:44:58,464 --> 02:45:02,089
TRAVIS: Maybe they will, maybe they won't. How
about for those who want to stay, we help build

2411
02:45:02,089 --> 02:45:05,984
some fortifications. For those who want to leave,
we'll protect them on their way there.

2412
02:45:05,984 --> 02:45:10,101
LIAM: We're at wartime. The people can live
underground. For now.

2413
02:45:10,101 --> 02:45:15,132
TALIESIN: Building will give them something to do.
And if the dragon comes back, they will be safe

2414
02:45:15,132 --> 02:45:23,380
underground. And if the dragon doesn't, we
have saved thousands of years of inspiration

2415
02:45:23,422 --> 02:45:30,796
and life. It's-- you can't just abandon something
like this! There's too much here.

2416
02:45:30,796 --> 02:45:33,258
LIAM: Otherwise, what else are we fighting for?

2417
02:45:33,258 --> 02:45:36,412
TALIESIN: Otherwise, it becomes our friend Pike
from Nowhere.

2418
02:45:36,412 --> 02:45:39,260
TRAVIS: That would be bad.

2419
02:45:39,260 --> 02:45:40,537
ASHLEY: That would be bad.

2420
02:45:40,537 --> 02:45:41,503
LAURA: That would be terrible.

2421
02:45:41,503 --> 02:45:42,724
TRAVIS: Scanlan, get their attention.

2422
02:45:42,724 --> 02:45:44,426
SAM: Get their attention? All right.

2423
02:45:44,426 --> 02:45:45,789
LAURA: And Pike, do you want to step up there?

2424
02:45:45,789 --> 02:45:47,148
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll go, I'll go.

2425
02:45:47,148 --> 02:45:50,849
SAM: I blow my horn to call the meeting to
attention.

2426
02:45:50,849 --> 02:45:56,950
MATT: (horn noise) Everyone gets really quiet. The
two of you step up onto the platform--

2427
02:45:56,950 --> 02:45:58,380
ASHLEY: (airhorn noises)

2428
02:45:58,380 --> 02:46:07,346
MATT: (laughs) It gets quiet. Everyone gets quiet.
You hear one voice in the back go, "That's my

2429
02:46:07,346 --> 02:46:12,669
"Pike!" As you immediately look over, you see at
the far end is Wilhand, leaping up, trying to get

2430
02:46:12,669 --> 02:46:19,532
a view between the crowd. Everyone's quiet,
looking at the two of you, now on top of this

2431
02:46:19,532 --> 02:46:23,738
platform. Which puts you just over head
height from the rest of the folks, by the way.

2432
02:46:23,738 --> 02:46:27,653
ASHLEY: (stuttering) Hello, everybody from the
town.

2433
02:46:27,653 --> 02:46:31,035
SAM: I'm doing sign-language interpretation.

2434
02:46:31,035 --> 02:46:36,327
(laughter)

2435
02:46:36,327 --> 02:46:42,745
ASHLEY: I know I'm not one usually to speak up, but
because I know so many of you and some of you are

2436
02:46:42,745 --> 02:46:55,020
family-- (blows kiss) Um, we-- I'm sure you guys
have heard because of the party and festivities

2437
02:46:55,020 --> 02:46:57,445
from last night, the dragon has been killed.

2438
02:46:57,445 --> 02:47:01,412
MATT: There's a cheer (crowd cheers), clapping--

2439
02:47:01,412 --> 02:47:09,139
ASHLEY: And we know that some of you have stayed
because if anything else, this is your home.

2440
02:47:09,139 --> 02:47:11,217
MATT: Some murmuring.

2441
02:47:11,217 --> 02:47:19,987
ASHLEY: And some of your family has left for
Kymal?

2442
02:47:19,987 --> 02:47:21,478
SAM: Kymal.

2443
02:47:21,478 --> 02:47:32,281
ASHLEY: Kymal. But we wanted to give you all an
option. And for those of you that do want to stay,

2444
02:47:32,281 --> 02:47:43,511
we would like to provide you with an underground
protection of sorts.

2445
02:47:43,511 --> 02:47:47,955
MATT: (whispering and murmuring) Whispers
through the crowds.

2446
02:47:47,955 --> 02:47:59,398
SAM: As we speak, upwards of 40,000 gold are being
delivered by your finest men. This, with our help, can

2447
02:47:59,398 --> 02:48:06,051
help construct a sturdy underground layer that
will shelter you if the dragon were to come back. It

2448
02:48:06,051 --> 02:48:10,804
will take days, possibly weeks to construct this.
But if you wanted to stay, this would be your best

2449
02:48:10,804 --> 02:48:17,143
bet. However, we are not forcing you to do
anything. If you would like to go with the fellow

2450
02:48:17,143 --> 02:48:24,644
refugees to Kymal, or find your fellow citizens
scattered about, roving in the lowlands, that

2451
02:48:24,644 --> 02:48:30,861
would be fine too. We need to come to an agreement
today, so that we can help you do what <i>you</i> want.

2452
02:48:30,861 --> 02:48:40,831
MATT: One gentleman takes the stage next to you
guys, man in his younger 20s, kind of soot

2453
02:48:40,831 --> 02:48:45,399
smeared on his cheeks. Looks like he's a little
weathered by the experience. Even though he looks

2454
02:48:45,399 --> 02:48:53,502
young and thin, there is a general hardness to his
face from recent experiences. He kind of raises

2455
02:48:53,502 --> 02:48:56,609
up, looking at the both of you, below him:

2456
02:48:56,609 --> 02:49:06,311
"I, for one, miss my family and have no home to go
back to. And the the homes that are empty in this

2457
02:49:06,311 --> 02:49:12,666
"town right now are empty because those who lived
there are now dead. There are ghosts here I

2458
02:49:12,666 --> 02:49:17,581
"wish not to see every morning when I wake up. If
I'm going to live here, I want to return with

2459
02:49:17,581 --> 02:49:24,715
"those that are important to me and build a new
home, over the old. Now is not my time to stay.

2460
02:49:24,715 --> 02:49:32,212
"Especially if more of those things are coming back.
If anyone wishes to come with me to Kymal, please,

2461
02:49:32,212 --> 02:49:33,467
"stand with me."

2462
02:49:33,467 --> 02:49:38,773
And he steps off the stage and make his way to
the right side of the stage. Everyone in the crowd

2463
02:49:38,773 --> 02:49:43,944
looks to each other, and few folks begin filtering
off and gathering around him. I'd say about a

2464
02:49:43,944 --> 02:49:49,494
third to half of the crowd begins to shift over as
another person steps up right next to you

2465
02:49:49,494 --> 02:49:58,085
guys, actually. This is a woman in her late 40s or
so. She's wearing relatively nice clothing

2466
02:49:58,085 --> 02:50:03,263
that's been kind of torn apart through constant
use and not really having an option to change into.

2467
02:50:03,263 --> 02:50:07,733
She looks like she came from money, but has
definitely been pulled down to the same level as

2468
02:50:07,733 --> 02:50:11,775
the rest of the folks here; they're living in
destitution out of necessity. Her hair's

2469
02:50:11,775 --> 02:50:16,167
trying to be pulled up into a bun, but a lot of it
is kind of falling around her face, and she's keeping

2470
02:50:16,167 --> 02:50:20,376
this kind of poor facade of her previous life. And
she stands up:

2471
02:50:20,376 --> 02:50:29,641
"I myself, my family's history is here in this town and
I would be remiss if I didn't express my

2472
02:50:29,641 --> 02:50:36,342
"hesitation in leaving that behind, for the next
roving horde of barbarians to rush in and take

2473
02:50:36,342 --> 02:50:41,732
"from us while we're away. Especially if this gold
is to be retrieved, how do we know how much of that

2474
02:50:41,732 --> 02:50:46,670
"is to be distributed? How much was my family's
versus yours? If we're to divide ourselves at this

2475
02:50:46,670 --> 02:50:52,931
"point, we're leaving ourselves open to inner
conflict, lest we have a very clear idea where

2476
02:50:52,931 --> 02:50:59,909
"these funds are going. And I, for one, want to
make sure I have a home when my family returns. So

2477
02:50:59,909 --> 02:51:06,172
"I'm not leaving. I'm not going to come back here
months down the line and find four layabouts

2478
02:51:06,172 --> 02:51:13,024
"living in that home, made a complete mess of our
things, and telling us it's now theirs. Those who

2479
02:51:13,024 --> 02:51:17,941
"wish to stay, stand with me." (harrumphs) And she
walks offstage, to the side--

2480
02:51:17,941 --> 02:51:20,568
TALIESIN: I'm going to get up on stage.

2481
02:51:20,568 --> 02:51:24,490
SAM: (whispers) You don't live here.

2482
02:51:24,490 --> 02:51:28,081
TALIESIN: The terrible woman may have a point.

2483
02:51:28,081 --> 02:51:31,392
(laughter)

2484
02:51:31,392 --> 02:51:34,341
MATT: "Thank you. What?"

2485
02:51:34,341 --> 02:51:44,954
TALIESIN: (sighs) Many of you are going to leave,
and that's fair. And that's right, you're free to

2486
02:51:44,954 --> 02:51:53,846
do so. I wish any of us could promise you safety
once you leave this city. But there is no safety

2487
02:51:53,846 --> 02:52:04,514
anywhere. The dragons fly freely. They may come
back and wreak their vengeance upon the rest of

2488
02:52:04,514 --> 02:52:14,656
Westruun once again. They may not. They may find
new, fresh targets. We don't know. (long sigh) We

2489
02:52:14,656 --> 02:52:22,825
will build an underground haven in case of attack,
free of charge. We will make a place that is open

2490
02:52:22,825 --> 02:52:32,770
to all. Since there seems to be some dispute about
the finances, we will create a trust that will be

2491
02:52:32,770 --> 02:52:41,617
used to help those who stay and help rebuild. It
will be managed and it will be fair. And it will not

2492
02:52:41,617 --> 02:52:47,157
go to titles. If you're properly titled, you'll
have money elsewhere, and you'll figure it out.

2493
02:52:47,157 --> 02:52:50,888
(laughter)

2494
02:52:50,888 --> 02:52:52,387
MATT: You hear, "Hmph!"

2495
02:52:52,387 --> 02:52:54,394
TALIESIN: New money.

2496
02:52:54,394 --> 02:52:57,490
(laughter)

2497
02:52:57,490 --> 02:52:59,521
SAM: Old magic!

2498
02:52:59,521 --> 02:53:10,397
TALIESIN: Old magic, new money from ivory towers.
I would urge you to stay. I would urge you to

2499
02:53:10,397 --> 02:53:20,174
leave, collect your people and return. I would
urge for one city not to be wiped from the map.

2500
02:53:20,174 --> 02:53:28,111
And anything we can do to make this at least
livable while it is rebuilt, we will do our best

2501
02:53:28,111 --> 02:53:36,817
to help. (sighs) It is such a victory for them if
Westruun falls. And I sit back down.

2502
02:53:36,817 --> 02:53:38,942
MATT: Make a persuasion check with advantage.

2503
02:53:38,942 --> 02:53:47,601
TALIESIN: 22.

2504
02:53:47,601 --> 02:53:56,279
MATT: There is a silence in the crowd and people
have stopped shuffling from side to side. Some of

2505
02:53:56,279 --> 02:54:02,213
the folks on the side of the gentleman began to
shift back and people tend to stand up. And even the

2506
02:54:02,253 --> 02:54:10,390
gentleman who was standing at the opposite side kind of
ponders for a moment: "Well, regardless of what

2507
02:54:10,390 --> 02:54:16,229
"happens, we have to get word out. We have to let
our loved ones know what has happened, and that

2508
02:54:16,229 --> 02:54:27,741
"it's safe to come back. If you indeed can help us
set this about, I'm confident we can keep out

2509
02:54:27,741 --> 02:54:32,371
"of sight. At least, hopefully."

2510
02:54:32,371 --> 02:54:41,420
MARISHA: I stand up on the podium. Um, sorry.
While the terrible man and the terrible woman both

2511
02:54:41,420 --> 02:54:43,091
absolutely have a point--

2512
02:54:43,091 --> 02:54:44,379
SAM: (whispers) He's not that bad.

2513
02:54:44,379 --> 02:54:45,672
TALIESIN: (whispers) I'm that bad.

2514
02:54:45,672 --> 02:54:56,938
MARISHA: I look at the man who's off to side. I
agree with you that finding your loved ones is

2515
02:54:56,938 --> 02:55:09,562
most important. I believe we can actually maybe
do a little bit of both here and solve both problems.

2516
02:55:09,562 --> 02:55:17,930
Me, alongside with the help of other magic
users, can help quickly build an underground

2517
02:55:17,930 --> 02:55:28,034
bunker. And I would be willing to help escort any
party to Kymal in order to help find your people.

2518
02:55:28,034 --> 02:55:42,738
Whereas I do agree, to an extent, with Percy that we
should not let Westruun fall to this, this city is

2519
02:55:42,738 --> 02:55:45,860
only as great as its people.

2520
02:55:45,860 --> 02:55:48,465
LAURA: Woo! Good leadership!

2521
02:55:48,465 --> 02:55:52,293
(laughter)

2522
02:55:52,293 --> 02:55:53,626
SAM: That's definitely Vex.

2523
02:55:53,626 --> 02:55:58,964
MATT: Some claps and a few folks kind of agree and
nod their heads. The gentleman that you've been

2524
02:55:58,964 --> 02:56:02,957
talking to kind of looks at you and he's very
intently engaged and nodding in agreement.

2525
02:56:02,957 --> 02:56:12,469
MARISHA: Uh. To Westrunn! Huzzah!?

2526
02:56:12,469 --> 02:56:14,656
LAURA: Huzzah!

2527
02:56:14,656 --> 02:56:17,259
TALIESIN: The awkward woman makes a fine point!

2528
02:56:17,259 --> 02:56:20,524
MATT: And the people eventually raise their arms,
"To Westruun!" "To Westruun!"

2529
02:56:20,524 --> 02:56:22,738
(laughter)

2530
02:56:22,738 --> 02:56:24,566
MATT: The clapping comes together.

2531
02:56:24,566 --> 02:56:29,124
TRAVIS: Yeah, football rules!

2532
02:56:29,301 --> 02:56:33,318
TALIESIN: Pike, do you remember that spell
you cast on Greyskull Keep when it got hit by

2533
02:56:33,384 --> 02:56:35,454
the dragon? The thing you did--

2534
02:56:35,454 --> 02:56:37,590
LAURA: That was Divine Intervention, I thought.

2535
02:56:37,590 --> 02:56:38,692
TALIESIN: Was that Divine--?

2536
02:56:38,692 --> 02:56:40,824
MATT: No, she summoned a Planar Ally. That one
was--

2537
02:56:40,824 --> 02:56:42,188
ASHLEY: To help rebuild?

2538
02:56:42,188 --> 02:56:45,262
TALIESIN: That was expensive, wasn't it?

2539
02:56:45,262 --> 02:56:46,753
ASHLEY: No.

2540
02:56:46,847 --> 02:56:49,619
MATT: That spell was expensive.

2541
02:56:49,683 --> 02:56:50,709
ASHLEY: Yes!

2542
02:56:50,709 --> 02:56:52,732
LAURA: It was, like, a thousand gold?

2543
02:56:52,732 --> 02:56:57,034
MATT: That was Planar Ally--

2544
02:56:57,136 --> 02:57:00,534
ASHLEY: What do you want to rebuild? I mean,
underground--

2545
02:57:00,534 --> 02:57:08,138
MATT: Depends on how long you want it to stay. So
a task measured in hours requires a thousand gold

2546
02:57:08,138 --> 02:57:09,136
per hour.

2547
02:57:09,136 --> 02:57:10,249
TALIESIN: No, no, no.

2548
02:57:10,249 --> 02:57:12,537
MATT: A task measured in days requires 10,000 gold
per day--

2549
02:57:12,537 --> 02:57:13,966
LAURA: (in alarm) No, no, no!

2550
02:57:13,966 --> 02:57:18,563
MATT: Mind you, these entities can do some crazy
stuff.

2551
02:57:18,563 --> 02:57:22,932
SAM: Yeah. And we have 40,000 more gold coming.
That's four days of entities--

2552
02:57:22,932 --> 02:57:26,325
LAURA: But I don't want to use up all the--
we can do that after things are--

2553
02:57:26,325 --> 02:57:28,139
SAM: What else are we going to spend the money
on?

2554
02:57:28,139 --> 02:57:30,269
ASHLEY: I can try Divine Intervention again so--

2555
02:57:30,269 --> 02:57:33,088
MARISHA: We don't want to rebuild a city that's
going to be stomped by dragons in another three

2556
02:57:33,088 --> 02:57:34,098
months!

2557
02:57:34,098 --> 02:57:35,358
ASHLEY: No, just the bunker, right?

2558
02:57:35,358 --> 02:57:36,444
LAURA: Just the bunker--

2559
02:57:36,444 --> 02:57:37,284
ASHLEY: Not the city.

2560
02:57:37,284 --> 02:57:38,051
LAURA: No.

2561
02:57:38,051 --> 02:57:39,541
ASHLEY: Keyleth can make the bunker.

2562
02:57:39,541 --> 02:57:40,625
LAURA: It's fine.

2563
02:57:40,625 --> 02:57:42,375
SAM: For hundreds and hundreds of people?

2564
02:57:42,375 --> 02:57:43,499
TALIESIN: Yes.

2565
02:57:43,499 --> 02:57:47,941
MARISHA: Honestly, if we take a couple days, I
can make a pretty extensive--

2566
02:57:47,941 --> 02:57:53,945
TALIESIN: We're going to use a previously existing
sewer system, and we're just going to reinforce it

2567
02:57:53,945 --> 02:57:58,518
with pillars and then block off any of the sewage
and re-route it, since it doesn't have to handle

2568
02:57:58,518 --> 02:58:00,701
the load that it used to.

2569
02:58:00,701 --> 02:58:02,646
ASHLEY: We're going to build a vault?

2570
02:58:02,646 --> 02:58:03,951
TALIESIN: We're going to build a vault.

2571
02:58:03,951 --> 02:58:10,171
PATRICK: While they're chatting, I'll step forward
and I'll say: we all have a lot to think about.

2572
02:58:10,171 --> 02:58:19,404
Talk with your friends and neighbors and come to
know your own minds. This is a decision that has

2573
02:58:19,404 --> 02:58:24,801
to be made soon, but not on the spur of the
moment. Thank you for coming.

2574
02:58:24,801 --> 02:58:31,870
MATT: One man in the front, an old friend of
yours, his name is Joseph, puts his hand up,

2575
02:58:31,870 --> 02:58:40,538
"Kerrek! Of which mind are you? Are you staying or
are you going? Are you going to escort, go along

2576
02:58:40,538 --> 02:58:46,006
"as an escort with this woman, or are you staying
to protect us? Where you walk, I walk."

2577
02:58:46,006 --> 02:59:00,846
PATRICK: I am going to do what would be best for
the town as a whole. I am not sure-- to a certain

2578
02:59:00,846 --> 02:59:05,670
extent, I'll be led what is needed by the town.
If--

2579
02:59:05,670 --> 02:59:08,150
MATT: "What we need is a decision."

2580
02:59:08,150 --> 02:59:14,496
SAM: If I may, If I may, I'm so sorry, I know
everyone's talking here. A city is not just a

2581
02:59:14,496 --> 02:59:21,541
collection of houses and streets. It is a person
of itself. And we can't go dividing it right now.

2582
02:59:21,541 --> 02:59:28,113
Everyone should stay here. Everyone should be a
unit, a cohesive unit. And we: me, Keyleth, and

2583
02:59:28,113 --> 02:59:35,321
one of your own, Pike, will definitely travel to
Kymal to spread the word, if you give us a list of

2584
02:59:35,321 --> 02:59:41,086
your ancestors, family members, friends, we can
get word to all of them very quickly.

2585
02:59:41,086 --> 02:59:42,710
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2586
02:59:42,710 --> 02:59:51,194
SAM: 28.

2587
02:59:51,194 --> 02:59:57,681
MATT: Everyone in the crowd seems to nod, and the
gentleman kind of nods his head to you, "All right."

2588
02:59:57,681 --> 03:00:00,024
(laughter)

2589
03:00:00,024 --> 03:00:01,455
TALIESIN: You're a monster.

2590
03:00:01,455 --> 03:00:10,576
PATRICK: Since you haven't been as present in the
community for a while, if I am sure that things

2591
03:00:10,576 --> 03:00:20,465
are adequately defended here, I might go myself to
ensure the proper apportionment of funds and to

2592
03:00:20,465 --> 03:00:26,830
talk to those of our townsfolk who have already
left, and perhaps organize them a little more

2593
03:00:26,830 --> 03:00:28,966
effectively so that they can return.

2594
03:00:28,966 --> 03:00:33,072
MATT: There's a few nods of agreement that spread
through the crowd, and actually, the folks on the

2595
03:00:33,072 --> 03:00:37,446
left side, with the woman that seemed to building
tension and arguing amongst themselves over the

2596
03:00:37,446 --> 03:00:42,518
ideas of that, seem to quiet a bit at you taking up
that position. You guys notice this, too; there's

2597
03:00:42,518 --> 03:00:54,279
a general respect for Kerrek that other folks
don't seem to carry in this community. Everyone

2598
03:00:54,279 --> 03:01:01,884
nods in agreement. "Well, I have no objections!"
"Neither do I." The woman on the other side.

2599
03:01:01,884 --> 03:01:09,970
(huffs) "Well, have no other choice, do we?"
Everyone nods, and they look up to the rest of

2600
03:01:09,970 --> 03:01:14,921
you. Look to you. "Then let's begin building."

2601
03:01:14,921 --> 03:01:19,822
LAURA: Bunker it is.

2602
03:01:19,822 --> 03:01:26,756
LIAM: As all that starts to wind down, I ask my
sister to point me towards Reginald's daughter.

2603
03:01:26,756 --> 03:01:30,969
LAURA: Do you see her?

2604
03:01:30,969 --> 03:01:33,620
LIAM: The one with the nice hair?

2605
03:01:33,620 --> 03:01:36,519
LAURA: Yeah, that one. And the giant bag of gold.

2606
03:01:36,519 --> 03:01:39,816
LIAM: I seek her out in the crowd.

2607
03:01:39,816 --> 03:01:45,381
MATT: She's still looking up, kind of by herself
in the crowd, clapping off to the side as you

2608
03:01:45,381 --> 03:01:46,270
approach.

2609
03:01:46,270 --> 03:01:47,588
SAM: I'm going to hang near him.

2610
03:01:47,588 --> 03:01:49,122
LIAM: Excuse me, young miss.

2611
03:01:49,122 --> 03:01:50,580
MATT: "Yes? Hi."

2612
03:01:50,580 --> 03:01:56,121
LIAM: I'm sorry. We haven't spoken, but you spoke
to my friends. You spoke to my sister. My sister

2613
03:01:56,121 --> 03:01:57,623
looks very much--

2614
03:01:57,623 --> 03:01:59,708
MATT: "I can see the similarity, yes."

2615
03:01:59,708 --> 03:02:13,268
LIAM: I know the news they delivered to you. I am
so sorry for your loss. Your father was very brave

2616
03:02:13,268 --> 03:02:25,885
at the end. Impressively so, and I want you to
know that. I've also recovered his body, and I

2617
03:02:25,885 --> 03:02:32,951
thought to add him to the pyres that this city did
outside the city, but I thought maybe you had a

2618
03:02:32,951 --> 03:02:39,574
family plot or somewhere you'd prefer him to be
laid to rest. I'll gladly take him there for you,

2619
03:02:39,574 --> 03:02:41,789
or take him with you. Whatever you prefer.

2620
03:02:41,789 --> 03:02:48,879
MATT: "I'll come with you. I'd like to see him one
last time. We have no family plot. We were meager

2621
03:02:48,879 --> 03:02:55,949
"folk. But he spent most of his life working in
that field. I think it's only fitting that's where

2622
03:02:55,949 --> 03:03:04,431
"he spends the rest of his days. Show me." And as
you guys begin the building process, she follows

2623
03:03:04,431 --> 03:03:10,169
you out to the field where she is shown the body
of Reginald, and she takes a moment of quiet with

2624
03:03:10,169 --> 03:03:18,261
him, and cradles his body. But there's a smile on
her face, and she says thank you for letting her

2625
03:03:18,261 --> 03:03:26,046
say goodbye face to face. With your help, you both
bring the body back to the farmhouse where you had

2626
03:03:26,046 --> 03:03:32,984
first met, and you spend the rest of the day
interring his body within the hillside that is

2627
03:03:32,984 --> 03:03:35,902
buttressed against the actual farmland that he
tilled.

2628
03:03:35,902 --> 03:03:45,638
LIAM: To lose a parent before their time is no
easy thing. I'm very sorry for you.

2629
03:03:45,638 --> 03:03:49,565
MATT: "It's all right. He did good."

2630
03:03:49,565 --> 03:03:51,611
LIAM: That he did.

2631
03:03:51,611 --> 03:04:01,469
MATT: "Let's go ahead and make sure the rest of
these folk have more to look forward to, shall we?"

2632
03:04:01,469 --> 03:04:11,583
She looks at you for a second, and you can
see she takes a general scope of your expression

2633
03:04:11,583 --> 03:04:18,062
and your emotional state, and even for a young
girl, she has a stronger insight than you

2634
03:04:18,062 --> 03:04:26,382
expected, and she puts her arm out and touches
your shoulder and says, "You carry too much

2635
03:04:26,382 --> 03:04:42,488
"sadness with you. You've done a lot of good. Let
yourself-- Let yourself understand and accept the

2636
03:04:42,488 --> 03:04:50,056
"fact that you've done a lot of good." And she
starts walking back towards the town.

2637
03:04:50,056 --> 03:04:54,177
LIAM: I linger for a bit.

2638
03:04:54,177 --> 03:05:05,531
MATT: All right. Now. You guys begin the process
of building this subterranean bunker. You take the

2639
03:05:05,531 --> 03:05:13,364
first day, scanning through as a group, clearing
out whatever creatures lurk beneath the city.

2640
03:05:13,364 --> 03:05:20,410
Nothing of severe threat lies down there to your
power level, and you know, what once was a threat to you

2641
03:05:20,410 --> 03:05:25,566
guys long ago, within the period of a day, you've
cleared out a very, very sizable portion of the

2642
03:05:25,566 --> 03:05:30,916
sewer system. And because it's been empty for
quite a while, it's also not in a very terrible

2643
03:05:30,916 --> 03:05:36,145
state either. I mean, it still needs to be
cleaned, but that's also the specialty of those

2644
03:05:36,145 --> 03:05:42,276
who can control water and air, let alone
reinforcing the stonework that keeps the walls

2645
03:05:42,276 --> 03:05:45,874
themselves sturdy, strong, able to support any
heavy weight on the surface.

2646
03:05:45,874 --> 03:05:53,077
Within the next couple days, you guys continue the
reinforcing process. People begin actually moving

2647
03:05:53,077 --> 03:05:59,711
their supplies down underground and begin taking
bits of furniture and elements that would at least

2648
03:05:59,711 --> 03:06:04,595
make life down there more comfortable, or at
least, a ghost image of some of the life they

2649
03:06:04,595 --> 03:06:10,358
lived above. Because when you're down there, the
comforts are what keep you going. But the people

2650
03:06:10,358 --> 03:06:15,327
seem, as more and more of it comes together, folks
genuinely begin to get a little excited at the

2651
03:06:15,327 --> 03:06:21,933
idea of having a safe place to live for a while.
And you feel like this is doing some good for

2652
03:06:21,933 --> 03:06:26,437
these folks at the very least. Whenever you guys
would like to take your journey--

2653
03:06:26,437 --> 03:06:31,840
TALIESIN: I would like to do a couple things just
to the room before we do anything other than this

2654
03:06:31,840 --> 03:06:33,912
to our houses.

2655
03:06:33,912 --> 03:06:35,407
MATT: Certainly.

2656
03:06:35,407 --> 03:06:39,182
TALIESIN: I would like on one wall to carve the
names of every survivor who stayed in the city.

2657
03:06:39,182 --> 03:06:41,100
And on the other wall start--

2658
03:06:41,100 --> 03:06:42,100
SAM: In Draconian.

2659
03:06:42,100 --> 03:06:43,089
TALIESIN: In Draconian.

2660
03:06:43,089 --> 03:06:44,236
(laughter)

2661
03:06:44,236 --> 03:06:50,095
TALIESIN: Terrible person. And on the other wall,
start carving in the story of--

2662
03:06:50,095 --> 03:06:56,038
MARISHA: Those we've lost? That's not what you
were going to say.

2663
03:06:56,038 --> 03:06:59,889
TALIESIN: What we've done to save the city, and
where the story, and where the city came from, and

2664
03:06:59,889 --> 03:07:07,671
what has happened, and make a place where other
people, they can start carving in also the history

2665
03:07:07,671 --> 03:07:13,454
and everything they need to say about the city,
just one of the giant walls, I just want to start

2666
03:07:13,454 --> 03:07:15,530
filling in with stories of the city.

2667
03:07:15,530 --> 03:07:20,819
MATT: Okay, and this catches your attention too,
because as pragmatic an individual as Percy is,

2668
03:07:20,819 --> 03:07:28,905
this is a strangely artistic endeavor of his
point, at least the intent behind it.

2669
03:07:28,905 --> 03:07:32,341
TALIESIN: You disagree with my opinions.

2670
03:07:32,341 --> 03:07:37,285
MARISHA: I don't really agree with immortalizing
ourselves in stone--

2671
03:07:37,285 --> 03:07:38,810
TALIESIN: It's not about us.

2672
03:07:38,810 --> 03:07:40,299
MARISHA: --way before we're even dead--

2673
03:07:40,299 --> 03:07:48,253
LAURA: It's not us, Keyleth. It's the history of
the town. Perk up, you're driving me crazy.

2674
03:07:48,253 --> 03:07:50,117
(laughter)

2675
03:07:50,117 --> 03:07:52,081
TALIESIN: How long do you live?

2676
03:07:52,081 --> 03:07:55,868
MARISHA: If I complete my journey, it could be
upward of a thousand years or more.

2677
03:07:55,868 --> 03:07:57,921
TALIESIN: How long do you think I live?

2678
03:07:57,921 --> 03:08:01,050
MARISHA: Less than a hundred? If you're lucky.

2679
03:08:01,050 --> 03:08:02,255
TALIESIN: No.

2680
03:08:02,255 --> 03:08:03,552
MARISHA: How long?

2681
03:08:03,552 --> 03:08:09,022
TALIESIN: (sighs) I am Percival Fredrickstein Von
Musel Klossowski de Rolo III.

2682
03:08:09,022 --> 03:08:10,539
MARISHA: No kidding.

2683
03:08:10,539 --> 03:08:17,399
TALIESIN: My ancestry dates back thousands of
years and will continue for thousands more, unless

2684
03:08:17,399 --> 03:08:29,311
Whitestone falls. I live as long as Whitestone
lives. This place is the human soul. This is what

2685
03:08:29,311 --> 03:08:35,934
we have built with our tiny moments. To lose a
place like this, we don't feel it immediately, but

2686
03:08:35,934 --> 03:08:41,759
it would ruin everyone in small ways.

2687
03:08:41,759 --> 03:08:49,170
MARISHA: Not all of us are lucky enough to have a
lineage in a name.

2688
03:08:49,170 --> 03:08:52,358
TALIESIN: Not all of us are lucky enough to have a
lineage in a lifespan.

2689
03:08:52,358 --> 03:08:56,546
MARISHA: Not many of us are lucky enough to have a
lineage at all.

2690
03:08:56,546 --> 03:09:00,603
TALIESIN: Which is why we save everyone we can.

2691
03:09:00,603 --> 03:09:06,407
MARISHA: I guess that is one thing we can both
agree on.

2692
03:09:06,407 --> 03:09:13,300
TALIESIN: This is good we're doing here. This is
great good. And it's not about idolizing

2693
03:09:13,300 --> 03:09:21,078
ourselves; it's about a very long story, which we
are, even you, a tiny part of.

2694
03:09:21,078 --> 03:09:26,549
MATT: At this moment, you look down and notice
that, while you guys were having this talk, a

2695
03:09:26,549 --> 03:09:31,770
small child has walked up to the wall and where
Percy has stopped the carving, the child has

2696
03:09:31,770 --> 03:09:35,451
picked up a piece of wayward chalk that was on the
ground and has begun to draw little stick figures

2697
03:09:35,451 --> 03:09:41,118
on the wall where you stopped. And in a little bit
of the quiet, he stops and looks up over his

2698
03:09:41,118 --> 03:09:45,571
shoulder at the two of you and smiles, and then
just goes back to writing on the wall.

2699
03:09:45,571 --> 03:09:50,358
TALIESIN: He'll outlive you, right there.

2700
03:09:50,358 --> 03:09:58,820
MARISHA: Yeah, no, you're probably right. Look at
him. I guess this little guy is like the moment

2701
03:09:58,820 --> 03:10:03,672
encapsulated. Hey, bud.

2702
03:10:03,672 --> 03:10:06,093
LIAM: (kid voice) That's a octopus!

2703
03:10:06,093 --> 03:10:12,035
LAURA: (kid voice) That's a shark. This is a
flower.

2704
03:10:12,035 --> 03:10:13,608
ASHLEY: (kid voice) This a bear!

2705
03:10:13,608 --> 03:10:15,761
TALIESIN: I give Keyleth a little hug.

2706
03:10:15,761 --> 03:10:23,005
SAM: Pikey-pants. Do you want to have gone to
Kymal? Or do you want to have stayed and helped?

2707
03:10:23,005 --> 03:10:26,709
ASHLEY: Didn't you volunteer me to help?

2708
03:10:26,709 --> 03:10:29,194
SAM: I volunteered you to come with me to Kymal.

2709
03:10:29,194 --> 03:10:32,505
ASHLEY: I'll go with you to Kymal.

2710
03:10:32,505 --> 03:10:36,117
TRAVIS: I'll come along to chaperone. No, I'm
kidding.

2711
03:10:36,117 --> 03:10:37,773
SAM: You can.

2712
03:10:37,773 --> 03:10:41,551
PATRICK: Oh, so these two things are happening
simultaneously?

2713
03:10:41,551 --> 03:10:43,259
MARISHA: Are these two things happening
simultaneously?

2714
03:10:43,259 --> 03:10:46,027
MATT: This is up to you guys. The Kymal journey--

2715
03:10:46,027 --> 03:10:47,505
LAURA: It's a couple days.

2716
03:10:47,505 --> 03:10:48,689
SAM: A couple days and back.

2717
03:10:48,689 --> 03:10:51,328
MATT: Well, not according to druidic spells.

2718
03:10:51,328 --> 03:10:54,245
SAM: Oh yeah. You could bamf us there.

2719
03:10:54,245 --> 03:10:59,185
MATT: Which is what I assumed you were referring
to about instantaneous travel.

2720
03:10:59,185 --> 03:11:03,009
TALIESIN: At some point we should put a teleport
circle in this, down here.

2721
03:11:03,009 --> 03:11:04,450
LAURA: That would probably be smart.

2722
03:11:04,450 --> 03:11:07,385
MATT: Well, you would have to contact an arcane
practitioner.

2723
03:11:07,385 --> 03:11:09,548
TALIESIN: Somebody else is going to do this. We've
got shit to do.

2724
03:11:09,548 --> 03:11:10,950
ASHLEY: Let's bamf in.

2725
03:11:10,950 --> 03:11:12,138
SAM: Let's go do it.

2726
03:11:12,138 --> 03:11:13,776
MARISHA: So we're all going to go?

2727
03:11:13,776 --> 03:11:16,001
MATT: If you would like to.

2728
03:11:16,001 --> 03:11:17,318
LAURA: I'm going to stay and help build.

2729
03:11:17,318 --> 03:11:22,219
MATT: Okay. So, Scanlan, Pike, and Keyleth, you're
going with them?

2730
03:11:22,219 --> 03:11:24,906
MARISHA: I guess so. You guys are going to need me
to get back.

2731
03:11:24,906 --> 03:11:27,506
SAM: That's true.

2732
03:11:27,506 --> 03:11:31,226
MARISHA: Unless I can get you there, and then you
can walk back. Fly there, walk back. Or you can--

2733
03:11:31,226 --> 03:11:34,464
TALIESIN: Teleport.

2734
03:11:34,464 --> 03:11:35,829
ASHLEY: Can you fly?

2735
03:11:35,829 --> 03:11:37,098
SAM: I can fly.

2736
03:11:37,098 --> 03:11:43,526
MARISHA: I can mist form us, and then we can get
there in how many hours?

2737
03:11:43,526 --> 03:11:48,397
MATT: Mist form, you'd get there in under a day.

2738
03:11:48,397 --> 03:11:53,349
MARISHA: Teleporting is more fun.

2739
03:11:53,349 --> 03:11:56,634
MATT: So what are you doing?

2740
03:11:56,634 --> 03:11:58,939
TALIESIN: Teleport them there, and then they can
get back on their own.

2741
03:11:58,939 --> 03:12:01,852
SAM: Yeah, we can get back on our own. It's two
days.

2742
03:12:01,852 --> 03:12:03,350
MARISHA: All right.

2743
03:12:03,350 --> 03:12:06,142
TALIESIN: They just killed a dragon, they'll be
fine. What's a bandit going to do?

2744
03:12:06,142 --> 03:12:09,315
MARISHA: Have fun, you gnomes! (magic crackle)

2745
03:12:09,315 --> 03:12:12,954
MATT: All right. She finds one of the surface
trees just outside of the sewage system. As she

2746
03:12:12,954 --> 03:12:18,966
touches her hands to its bark, the bark cracks and
splits open, revealing the doorway behind it,

2747
03:12:18,966 --> 03:12:25,097
about five foot of internal wood tunnel leads to
an opposing side that opens into what immediately

2748
03:12:25,097 --> 03:12:30,879
is a tent city on the outside walls of Kymal. You
guys quickly step through with the moments you

2749
03:12:30,879 --> 03:12:32,694
have before the portal slams shut.

2750
03:12:32,694 --> 03:12:33,974
MARISHA: High five! High five!

2751
03:12:33,974 --> 03:12:35,179
SAM: Nope.

2752
03:12:35,179 --> 03:12:36,322
MARISHA: Asshole.

2753
03:12:36,322 --> 03:12:40,649
MATT: You do get a little tag from Pike right
before it shuts.

2754
03:12:40,649 --> 03:12:41,907
MARISHA: Yeah! Scanlan, you suck!

2755
03:12:41,907 --> 03:12:43,717
(laughter)

2756
03:12:43,717 --> 03:12:49,391
MATT: You guys are now standing on the outside of
a small cluster of trees outside of Kymal. The

2757
03:12:49,391 --> 03:12:54,352
mountain range behind it, you can see, there are
hundreds and hundreds of people that are displaced

2758
03:12:54,352 --> 03:12:56,092
in the outside of the city in tents.

2759
03:12:56,092 --> 03:13:01,232
PATRICK: Before-- because assuming it's been, it
sounds like a couple of days, if there's walls and

2760
03:13:01,232 --> 03:13:05,239
artistry happening, have the wagons gotten back?

2761
03:13:05,239 --> 03:13:06,767
MATT: They have, actually, yes.

2762
03:13:06,767 --> 03:13:13,814
PATRICK: And if there are those resources, and I
know that this trip is happening, I've got to go

2763
03:13:13,814 --> 03:13:18,534
across and make sure that my people aren't dying
of dysentery.

2764
03:13:18,534 --> 03:13:20,292
SAM: You're coming?

2765
03:13:20,292 --> 03:13:21,462
PATRICK: Yeah.

2766
03:13:21,462 --> 03:13:27,338
SAM: Great. (coughing) Third wheel. Trying to get
some action here.

2767
03:13:27,338 --> 03:13:30,664
(laughter)

2768
03:13:30,664 --> 03:13:34,913
MATT: There's a high five tag to Keyleth as Pike
jumps through, and before it slams shut, Kerr

2769
03:13:34,913 --> 03:13:37,726
goes, "Wait!" and jumps through after.

2770
03:13:37,726 --> 03:13:41,749
SAM: No, this is great. It's great to have an old
dude with us also.

2771
03:13:41,749 --> 03:13:44,006
ASHLEY: I do think it's great!

2772
03:13:44,006 --> 03:13:45,419
LIAM: Two old dudes.

2773
03:13:45,419 --> 03:13:50,641
ASHLEY: There's so much that I wanted to talk to
you about, Kerr! I'm so glad that you came along!

2774
03:13:50,641 --> 03:13:52,614
SAM: (grumbles)

2775
03:13:52,614 --> 03:13:54,488
(laughter)

2776
03:13:54,488 --> 03:13:56,165
PATRICK: There's important work to be done here.

2777
03:13:56,165 --> 03:14:00,704
ASHLEY: There is very important work to be done,
and I feel like we all need to focus on that, and

2778
03:14:00,704 --> 03:14:06,737
get down to the nitty-gritty of it, you know?

2779
03:14:06,737 --> 03:14:11,641
LIAM: I think your nitty-gritty might be different
from somebody else's nitty-gritty.

2780
03:14:11,641 --> 03:14:13,862
(laughter)

2781
03:14:13,862 --> 03:14:15,098
ASHLEY: Let's go, let's walk!

2782
03:14:15,098 --> 03:14:19,956
SAM: Let's go spread the good word about Westruun,
and the great things happening in sewers there.

2783
03:14:19,956 --> 03:14:28,840
MATT: All right. You guys begin to make your way
from tent to tent, finding individuals, many of

2784
03:14:28,840 --> 03:14:33,868
which you recognize. Some have recognition of you,
and there's a brief little discussion of what's

2785
03:14:33,868 --> 03:14:40,718
happened, what's transpired, and you tell them of
the fall of Umbrasyl, of the herd being sundered

2786
03:14:40,718 --> 03:14:46,373
and sent westward, and making sure, as Scanlan
would, that Vox Machina is responsible.

2787
03:14:46,373 --> 03:14:48,539
SAM: Yes. And that it rhymes.

2788
03:14:48,539 --> 03:14:56,589
MATT: Indeed. There is no central guidance here.
The Margrave Tumner Wann, who runs Kymal, does

2789
03:14:56,589 --> 03:15:00,187
occasionally come out to check up on people. It's
not like they're being kept out of the city

2790
03:15:00,187 --> 03:15:03,558
forcefully. There's just no room for them. They've
taken in as many refugees as they can, and then

2791
03:15:03,558 --> 03:15:09,961
everyone else on the outside is being helped to
the best of their ability, but they're very thin

2792
03:15:10,040 --> 03:15:15,912
on resources. They've sent trade wagons out to
Stillben, even southward, they sent some over into

2793
03:15:15,912 --> 03:15:20,518
the Verdant Expanse to hopefully trade with
Syngorn. There have been people that have been

2794
03:15:20,518 --> 03:15:26,004
trying to help where they can. However, most of
the people outside are still beginning to starve a

2795
03:15:26,004 --> 03:15:32,262
little bit. A lot of the beasts of burden have
been converted into food out of necessity, so

2796
03:15:32,262 --> 03:15:37,536
there's a lot of empty carts and wagons around.
People are in this holding pattern, waiting to

2797
03:15:37,536 --> 03:15:41,978
hear any news. And the news that you bring does
bring hope to the eyes of those that do speak with you.

2798
03:15:41,978 --> 03:15:48,967
SAM: At some point in our journey I excuse myself
for ten minutes, drink my last shit-scrying

2799
03:15:48,967 --> 03:15:52,618
potion. Poop out a little loaf.

2800
03:15:52,618 --> 03:16:00,919
(laughter)

2801
03:16:00,919 --> 03:16:11,982
SAM: Take a tiny bit in it, wrap it in a little
bit of parchment, stick it in the secret

2802
03:16:11,982 --> 03:16:16,387
compartment of the hilt of the sword.

2803
03:16:16,387 --> 03:16:17,885
MATT: Okay.

2804
03:16:17,885 --> 03:16:19,729
SAM: The scabbard, yeah.

2805
03:16:19,729 --> 03:16:21,975
TALIESIN: You should name the sword Number Two.

2806
03:16:21,975 --> 03:16:25,678
(laughter)

2807
03:16:25,678 --> 03:16:26,772
SAM: I like it.

2808
03:16:26,772 --> 03:16:35,582
MATT: The classiest of magic practitioners,
Scanlan Shorthalt. You do so. Like spackling a

2809
03:16:35,582 --> 03:16:42,356
wall, you fill the compartment affixed within the
scabbard without issue.

2810
03:16:42,356 --> 03:16:43,613
SAM: Thank you.

2811
03:16:43,613 --> 03:16:45,414
LIAM: Shove that dingleberry in there.

2812
03:16:45,414 --> 03:16:47,061
TALIESIN: Fresh blueberry sherbet.

2813
03:16:47,061 --> 03:16:48,867
MATT: Anyway.

2814
03:16:48,867 --> 03:16:54,970
SAM: All right, so we've spread the good word. Are
people going to travel back, do you think?

2815
03:16:54,970 --> 03:16:59,671
MATT: Many folks are now considering returning.
Some folks speak of another group of people that

2816
03:16:59,671 --> 03:17:03,087
are over by the Foramere Basin. They're going to
go ahead and send people over there to give word.

2817
03:17:03,087 --> 03:17:11,003
Some people are asking to see if their family
members are okay, and you don't know everyone's

2818
03:17:11,003 --> 03:17:15,846
name there, but you tell them there are survivors.
Most of the people you talk to are intent on

2819
03:17:15,846 --> 03:17:20,553
returning, because this living situation is only
going to be so good for so long.

2820
03:17:20,553 --> 03:17:22,759
SAM: I hope we're not sentencing them to death.

2821
03:17:22,759 --> 03:17:26,594
TALIESIN: To be fair, the town you're
currently in could be gone next week.

2822
03:17:26,594 --> 03:17:28,073
SAM: That's true.

2823
03:17:28,073 --> 03:17:29,029
TALIESIN: Either way.

2824
03:17:29,029 --> 03:17:39,902
PATRICK: I know what's needed back there. I've got
access to money. They have wagons and labor. I

2825
03:17:39,902 --> 03:17:48,454
know most of the people in town, so I'm not going
to do it myself, but I know who-- honestly, anyone

2826
03:17:48,454 --> 03:17:54,248
who runs a farm is a better organizer than any
modern small business owner.

2827
03:17:54,248 --> 03:17:55,823
MATT: This is very true.

2828
03:17:55,823 --> 03:18:02,633
PATRICK: So I will talk to a few of these old,
capable farmer types and say, okay, here's the

2829
03:18:02,633 --> 03:18:15,137
money. You know how to bargain. Do your business,
and we can get together and we'll head back all

2830
03:18:15,137 --> 03:18:22,235
together. As soon as you can get everyone together
and all that. Also, I'll put somebody in charge

2831
03:18:22,235 --> 03:18:28,686
of making sure that we're bringing in food, and
I'll do a scan around and make sure that people

2832
03:18:28,686 --> 03:18:33,784
literally aren't dying of dysentery. That they
have a clean well and all of that stuff.

2833
03:18:33,784 --> 03:18:40,119
MATT: Yeah. I mean, there is disease, as tends to
happen when you have people who are displaced and

2834
03:18:40,119 --> 03:18:46,579
clustered like that in sub-par living conditions,
but no major pandemics that are kicking through

2835
03:18:46,579 --> 03:18:51,512
the people there. The people who are sick are
being tended to, and there are people who are

2836
03:18:51,512 --> 03:18:57,502
medically practiced, or at least herbalists and
such, that can help with that. You find a slight

2837
03:18:57,502 --> 03:19:01,428
group of trustworthy individuals that you know
would do well and understand the process, and with

2838
03:19:01,428 --> 03:19:06,397
the mere inclusion of a few thousand gold, would
be more than enough to be able to purchase from

2839
03:19:06,397 --> 03:19:14,027
the interior of Kymal enough oxen, horses, and
other beasts to bring most of the current carts

2840
03:19:14,027 --> 03:19:18,281
back with you. That was the only real barrier,
because Kymal was like, "We can't help you guys

2841
03:19:18,281 --> 03:19:24,621
"for free." Now there's gold, people are like, "Oh!
Well, let's talk." Charity only goes so far. But

2842
03:19:24,621 --> 03:19:27,804
you do feel through this trip that you've
definitely made an impact, and most of the people,

2843
03:19:27,804 --> 03:19:31,745
at least over the next week or so, will be
outfitted with the proper materials, food for the

2844
03:19:31,745 --> 03:19:33,744
journey, and be able to make their way back
towards Westruun.

2845
03:19:33,744 --> 03:19:40,204
SAM: And I will also go to look for Dr. Dra and
Kaylie at some point.

2846
03:19:40,204 --> 03:19:41,892
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

2847
03:19:41,892 --> 03:19:44,730
ASHLEY: I'll go with him.

2848
03:19:44,730 --> 03:19:46,039
SAM: 27.

2849
03:19:46,039 --> 03:19:50,528
MATT: Okay. As you walk with him, within mere
hours, almost like you picked up the scent on a

2850
03:19:50,528 --> 03:19:56,634
hunt, you see a glimmer of short, dark hair, and
you glance over, and sure enough, there is Kaylie,

2851
03:19:56,634 --> 03:20:02,091
who is currently holding over her shoulder Dr.
Dranzel, who is limping alongside her.

2852
03:20:02,091 --> 03:20:03,703
SAM: Oh God! Is he okay?

2853
03:20:03,703 --> 03:20:05,592
MATT: You can go and ask.

2854
03:20:05,592 --> 03:20:07,068
SAM: I'll go and ask!

2855
03:20:07,068 --> 03:20:09,041
MATT: They're walking across the street. They
haven't noticed you yet.

2856
03:20:09,041 --> 03:20:10,927
SAM: Oi! Shorthalt!

2857
03:20:10,927 --> 03:20:14,786
MATT: There's a stop, and Kaylie turns her head.

2858
03:20:14,786 --> 03:20:17,519
SAM: Hi.

2859
03:20:17,519 --> 03:20:25,895
MATT: She drops Dranzel's arm and rushes forward
and gives you a hug. And then lets go after a

2860
03:20:25,895 --> 03:20:30,991
second and pushes away. "Glad to see you survived.
That's good."

2861
03:20:30,991 --> 03:20:33,950
SAM: You, too. How's he?

2862
03:20:33,950 --> 03:20:38,024
MATT: "He's got a foot infection, nothing too
great to look about." You look down and his left

2863
03:20:38,024 --> 03:20:41,985
foot is all swollen. He's like, "I've had worse!"

2864
03:20:41,985 --> 03:20:44,271
SAM: Pike has healed feet before.

2865
03:20:44,271 --> 03:20:46,151
ASHLEY: May I?

2866
03:20:46,151 --> 03:20:51,778
MATT: "Please. Be my guest." As the half-orc grins
with his hat still floppy on his head, he presents

2867
03:20:51,778 --> 03:20:57,040
his horrible foot that gives off a delightful
smell of putrescence.

2868
03:20:57,040 --> 03:21:01,173
SAM: While she works on him, I'm going to take
Kaylie off to the side.

2869
03:21:01,173 --> 03:21:09,481
MATT: It's easy enough for you to cleanse elements
of disease with minor healing. We'll say for the

2870
03:21:09,481 --> 03:21:12,774
purposes of this, through a couple of low-level
spells you're able to pretty much take care of his

2871
03:21:12,774 --> 03:21:19,432
foot entirely. He's like, "That's incredible! I
mean, if you ever need a traveling troupe, we're

2872
03:21:19,432 --> 03:21:22,919
"always looking for someone to keep us on the up
and up! Can you cure hangovers?"

2873
03:21:22,919 --> 03:21:24,398
ASHLEY: I can.

2874
03:21:24,398 --> 03:21:30,141
MATT: "Well, hang with me, young Pike!" While this
is happening, you turn to Kaylie.

2875
03:21:30,141 --> 03:21:38,767
SAM: I'm so happy that you are alive and safe, and
I came a great distance to do other things, but

2876
03:21:38,767 --> 03:21:49,114
mainly to see you, and I just wanted to say a few
things before I go off to complete my mission. You

2877
03:21:49,114 --> 03:21:56,458
know, I know I'm not the father that you wanted,
but I'm the father that you have, and I'm sorry. I

2878
03:21:56,458 --> 03:22:06,514
just wanted to tell you that I've been doing a lot
of thinking about you, and me, and where I fit in

2879
03:22:06,514 --> 03:22:15,939
to the life of a family man. Most of my adult
life, I've been longing for a gnome to care for,

2880
03:22:15,939 --> 03:22:24,338
and I met a really good one, and she's here and
her name is Pike. And she's beautiful and

2881
03:22:24,338 --> 03:22:31,833
wonderful, and possibly my soulmate, but I've
learned that she's not my family and never will

2882
03:22:31,833 --> 03:22:42,055
be. You're the gnome that I'm to care for forever,
and I'm doing something very stupid now with my

2883
03:22:42,055 --> 03:22:50,232
friends. We're going to try to save the world. And
I didn't know why, but now I know, and if we die

2884
03:22:50,232 --> 03:22:56,726
doing it, it will be for a good thing, and if we
don't, then, well, I'll find you, and I'll be

2885
03:22:56,726 --> 03:23:02,380
whatever kind of father you need me to be. One
who's close and helpful.

2886
03:23:02,380 --> 03:23:07,579
MATT: She shushes you. Puts her finger up and
shushes you, then steps up and looks at you. The

2887
03:23:07,579 --> 03:23:13,756
hardness in her face softens, and there is a
little bit of tears gathering at the edge of her

2888
03:23:13,756 --> 03:23:19,512
eyes when she says, "Don't you die. You stay
alive."

2889
03:23:19,512 --> 03:23:25,420
SAM: I don't intend to. But you know, I was just
inside a--

2890
03:23:25,420 --> 03:23:32,533
MATT: "You're. Not. Going. To die. You're going to
go do your stupid world-saving mission like you

2891
03:23:32,533 --> 03:23:36,792
"told me, and you're going to come back, and we're
going to have a lot to talk about."

2892
03:23:36,792 --> 03:23:39,670
SAM: All right.

2893
03:23:39,670 --> 03:23:42,330
MATT: "All right. Can you do that for me?"

2894
03:23:42,330 --> 03:23:48,068
SAM: I promise you. I promise you.

2895
03:23:48,068 --> 03:23:49,816
MATT: "I'll hold you to that."

2896
03:23:49,816 --> 03:24:02,607
SAM: Well, you do the same, all right? Stay safe.
I got you a present. It's a ring. It's a beautiful

2897
03:24:02,607 --> 03:24:06,780
ring because you're a beautiful girl, and I'd like
you to keep it.

2898
03:24:06,780 --> 03:24:12,678
MATT: She takes it and looks at it and goes, "Are
you sure this wasn't for someone else?"

2899
03:24:12,678 --> 03:24:15,770
SAM: No. Never.

2900
03:24:15,770 --> 03:24:18,435
MATT: She puts it on.

2901
03:24:18,435 --> 03:24:26,076
SAM: And you're also strong, and you'll need this
sword. And I give her my Singing Dawn Blade, which

2902
03:24:26,076 --> 03:24:35,724
has a unique little imperfection at the bottom of
it, and I say, this sword has killed a king, which

2903
03:24:35,724 --> 03:24:43,120
makes it almost worthy enough for you. I hope that
it keeps you safe until I can see you again.

2904
03:24:43,120 --> 03:24:59,638
MATT: "I don't know what to say. I'll start with
thank you. Well, I feel pretty well protected."

2905
03:24:59,638 --> 03:25:06,108
SAM: Okay. Get out of here. If you can, try to
make your way to Vasselheim. There's three more

2906
03:25:06,108 --> 03:25:10,069
dragons, and it'll be a while before I kill them
all.

2907
03:25:10,069 --> 03:25:17,142
MATT: "I don't know, you've done quite a bit of
work in even these past few weeks. Vasselheim.

2908
03:25:17,142 --> 03:25:24,436
"I'll talk it over with the doctor. See what he's
interested in. You promised."

2909
03:25:24,436 --> 03:25:26,327
SAM: Gnome's honor.

2910
03:25:26,327 --> 03:25:32,172
MATT: She reaches up and grabs your shirt and
gives you a kiss on the forehead. And then pushes

2911
03:25:32,172 --> 03:25:38,481
you away and says, "Get out of my fucking face."
Turns around and walks back towards Dr. Dranzel.

2912
03:25:38,481 --> 03:25:41,806
SAM: All right, Pike, I'm done.

2913
03:25:41,806 --> 03:25:43,247
ASHLEY: Okay!

2914
03:25:43,247 --> 03:25:46,576
MATT: "But she's not done! You're sticking with
us, right?"

2915
03:25:46,576 --> 03:25:48,882
ASHLEY: I don't think I can.

2916
03:25:48,882 --> 03:25:53,597
MATT: "Oh, I know. I'm just-- I try."

2917
03:25:53,597 --> 03:25:56,536
ASHLEY: But you guys are headed to-- Where are you
headed to? Where are you going to go?

2918
03:25:56,536 --> 03:26:02,544
MATT: "I don't know! I figure we can-- based on
what we're hearing around here, folks are heading

2919
03:26:02,544 --> 03:26:10,658
"back to Westruun. They probably need some cheering
up on the road. From there, who knows? Actually,

2920
03:26:10,658 --> 03:26:19,166
"I've never been to Marquet before, but I'm
thinking--" At this point, Kaylie comes up and

2921
03:26:19,166 --> 03:26:25,620
goes, "Let's have a talk. I'm feeling a bit of
religion coming on. Perhaps we should look further

2922
03:26:25,620 --> 03:26:31,455
"west. Northwest. Vasselheim. Not a lot of music in
those parts. They'll be willing to pay for that, I

2923
03:26:31,455 --> 03:26:42,211
"assume." He's like, "Vasselheim? It's cold there,
isn't it? Let's get some furs." They both start

2924
03:26:42,211 --> 03:26:43,923
walking away from you guys.

2925
03:26:43,923 --> 03:26:50,565
ASHLEY: Before they go, I just reach out my hand
and introduce myself to Kaylie. I've heard many

2926
03:26:50,565 --> 03:26:52,615
lovely things about you.

2927
03:26:52,615 --> 03:27:02,967
MATT: She looks at you guardedly and takes your
hand. "As I've heard of you. He made a promise."

2928
03:27:02,967 --> 03:27:07,319
ASHLEY: I'll make sure that he keeps it.

2929
03:27:07,319 --> 03:27:25,076
MATT: "Thank you." They keep walking. So, with the
money dispersed, the group having a returning

2930
03:27:25,076 --> 03:27:33,020
sense of hope, with materials, goods, food being
redistributed amongst the refugees, it appears

2931
03:27:33,020 --> 03:27:39,253
there is a direction for the future of Westruun
that you've set into place. As you guys gather the

2932
03:27:39,253 --> 03:27:44,081
rest of your things, Keyleth, you take an
evening's rest with the troupe, and the next

2933
03:27:44,081 --> 03:27:46,414
morning return back to Westruun.

2934
03:27:46,414 --> 03:27:57,578
LIAM: Something I wanted to do last night. In all
the hubbub that's going on in Westruun, I spend

2935
03:27:57,578 --> 03:28:00,529
some time to find my sister, and I wanted to
stealth up on her.

2936
03:28:00,529 --> 03:28:08,436
MATT: Easy enough to do while they're out and
about taking their rest with the group in Kymal,

2937
03:28:08,436 --> 03:28:12,120
while you guys are still helping rebuilding. So
yes, go ahead and make a stealth check.

2938
03:28:12,120 --> 03:28:15,467
LAURA: I'm just reading these names on this wall!

2939
03:28:15,467 --> 03:28:16,679
LIAM: 20.

2940
03:28:16,679 --> 03:28:18,678
MATT: What's your passive perception?

2941
03:28:18,678 --> 03:28:19,590
LAURA: 21.

2942
03:28:19,590 --> 03:28:20,876
SAM: Oh, shit!

2943
03:28:20,876 --> 03:28:27,015
MATT: You hear a few very, very faint, very
familiar steps come across the stones behind you.

2944
03:28:27,015 --> 03:28:29,163
LAURA: I pretend like I don't hear them.

2945
03:28:29,163 --> 03:28:41,864
LIAM: Stubby! And I pull her into a big fat hug.
Your hair looks like shit, sit down. I start

2946
03:28:41,864 --> 03:28:43,337
braiding it.

2947
03:28:43,337 --> 03:28:45,558
LAURA: I love you too.

2948
03:28:45,558 --> 03:28:56,031
LIAM: Elaina would be proud of you. I'm proud of
you.

2949
03:28:56,031 --> 03:28:58,843
LAURA: That's worth more.

2950
03:28:58,843 --> 03:29:01,649
LIAM: Saved my life again.

2951
03:29:01,649 --> 03:29:04,418
LAURA: Did I?

2952
03:29:04,418 --> 03:29:11,576
LIAM: I crawled out through an arrow hole.

2953
03:29:11,576 --> 03:29:20,806
LAURA: (laughs) I saw this little lump squirming.
I thought it was probably you. Tiny little you.

2954
03:29:20,806 --> 03:29:24,533
LIAM: There's a bit of chicken here.

2955
03:29:24,533 --> 03:29:28,616
LAURA: Oh, ow!

2956
03:29:28,616 --> 03:29:30,670
LIAM: One day at a time, right?

2957
03:29:30,670 --> 03:29:34,321
LAURA: One day at a time. Ow!

2958
03:29:34,321 --> 03:29:37,362
LIAM: There.

2959
03:29:37,362 --> 03:29:48,709
MATT: All right. As you guys spend the next few
days together, forming what is a fairly functional

2960
03:29:48,709 --> 03:29:54,690
stronghold, for at least the necessary needs of
protecting a fair amount of refugees beneath the

2961
03:29:54,690 --> 03:29:59,323
northern area of Westruun, you feel confident that
with the folks that are here and the folks that

2962
03:29:59,323 --> 03:30:05,409
are coming, there's enough of a community building
now where it may not be absolutely necessary for

2963
03:30:05,409 --> 03:30:10,312
your perpetual oversight and presence, should you
have business elsewhere.

2964
03:30:10,312 --> 03:30:18,247
Anything else you wish to take care of
before you continue your journey?

2965
03:30:18,247 --> 03:30:22,337
TALIESIN: I have a small package and letter that I
want to deliver to Kerr before we leave, but other

2966
03:30:22,337 --> 03:30:23,394
than that.

2967
03:30:23,394 --> 03:30:24,700
SAM: A Kerr package?

2968
03:30:24,700 --> 03:30:31,064
TALIESIN: Yes. I was hoping, I was really hoping,
someone would say that.

2969
03:30:31,064 --> 03:30:38,984
LAURA: I would like to pull Kerr aside and say,
you know these people here, they're a bit lost,

2970
03:30:38,984 --> 03:30:41,211
and they need a leader.

2971
03:30:41,211 --> 03:30:48,705
PATRICK: Yeah, they absolutely do. We'll see if we
can find them one.

2972
03:30:48,705 --> 03:30:54,004
LAURA: I'm looking at one that would be wonderful.
Just something to think about.

2973
03:30:54,004 --> 03:31:07,209
PATRICK: I've thought about it. But no. But you're
very kind. You know, over-- How long has this been

2974
03:31:07,209 --> 03:31:10,017
going on?

2975
03:31:10,017 --> 03:31:16,352
MATT: You're going on the better part of two weeks
since the initial dragon attack. A little over two

2976
03:31:16,352 --> 03:31:17,747
weeks, maybe, by now.

2977
03:31:17,747 --> 03:31:23,539
PATRICK: One thing that I'll make a point of doing
is, while a lot of this is going on and I'm seeing

2978
03:31:23,539 --> 03:31:32,271
what they're really capable of, in terms of
reshaping everything, I'll spend a little bit of

2979
03:31:32,271 --> 03:31:41,678
time at her shoulder. We'll talk, maybe a little
bit, or not. Depending on what she's in the mood

2980
03:31:41,678 --> 03:32:02,116
for. And the general gist of it is, you know, that
it takes a long time, doing the stuff like this.

2981
03:32:02,116 --> 03:32:15,850
You're making something. And sometimes it doesn't
seem to balance out that scale very well, but

2982
03:32:15,850 --> 03:32:24,778
that's all you can do. And sometimes all you can
do is be around for people while they make things,

2983
03:32:24,778 --> 03:32:28,727
because you can't do everything.

2984
03:32:28,727 --> 03:32:40,067
MARISHA: Well, Kerr, I'm certainly glad that you
showed up in my life, in this time, when I am

2985
03:32:40,067 --> 03:32:47,547
building this-- whatever the hell this is. Thank
you.

2986
03:32:47,547 --> 03:32:54,911
TALIESIN: We've made you something, if you will
accept it. We pull out a small wooden box that we

2987
03:32:54,911 --> 03:32:56,484
put together.

2988
03:32:56,484 --> 03:33:00,292
MARISHA: I put some Ashari decorative stuff around
it.

2989
03:33:00,292 --> 03:33:06,405
MATT: So the box itself is wooden, but there is
fresh, living ivy curled across it with a few

2990
03:33:06,405 --> 03:33:09,212
bursts of beautiful red flowers on each side.

2991
03:33:09,212 --> 03:33:11,817
MARISHA: Totally. What's the flower of Westruun?

2992
03:33:11,817 --> 03:33:19,240
MATT: The flower of Westruun would actually be the
white iris, which grows around the western side of it.

2993
03:33:19,240 --> 03:33:21,276
MARISHA: Beautiful. It's covered in white irises.

2994
03:33:21,276 --> 03:33:24,339
TALIESIN: You sick fuck. You're amazing.

2995
03:33:24,339 --> 03:33:26,776
LAURA: Oh, the white iris. No big deal. It's the
white iris.

2996
03:33:26,776 --> 03:33:28,708
TALIESIN: Talk Westruun to me.

2997
03:33:28,708 --> 03:33:32,875
PATRICK: I'll--

2998
03:33:32,875 --> 03:33:35,856
SAM: Spring snakes!

2999
03:33:35,856 --> 03:33:46,247
TALIESIN: Too soon! Inside is a scrolled
parchment, a wooden bracelet, and a metal

3000
03:33:46,247 --> 03:33:48,248
circlet.

3001
03:33:48,248 --> 03:33:53,308
(water bottle falls off the table loudly)

3002
03:33:53,308 --> 03:33:55,209
SAM: Spring snakes!

3003
03:33:55,209 --> 03:33:58,654
TALIESIN: Trying to have a moment, thank you.

3004
03:33:58,654 --> 03:34:00,497
PATRICK: Have I got the first clue?

3005
03:34:00,497 --> 03:34:01,854
MATT: No.

3006
03:34:01,854 --> 03:34:08,862
TALIESIN: The parchment will explain everything
and how to use them, but this circlet and this

3007
03:34:08,862 --> 03:34:18,383
bracelet will help make you a champion that can
help protect this city now. And should the need

3008
03:34:18,383 --> 03:34:25,455
arise, this circlet will give you control of the
body of a creature that will help.

3009
03:34:25,455 --> 03:34:34,449
MARISHA: His name's Fassbender. And he's got an
awesome mustache. And the bracelet's kind of just

3010
03:34:34,449 --> 03:34:39,708
a bracelet, but I made it. It might be a
friendship bracelet.

3011
03:34:39,708 --> 03:34:42,670
PATRICK: I'll put that on.

3012
03:34:42,670 --> 03:34:46,063
MARISHA: It might say "friendship" in Ashari.

3013
03:34:46,063 --> 03:34:53,119
TALIESIN: The circlet will, if anything, if the
need ever arises, it will be something that will

3014
03:34:53,119 --> 03:34:59,235
help protect the city. The scroll will explain the
particulars.

3015
03:34:59,235 --> 03:35:02,626
MARISHA: If you go up by the funeral pyres, where
we set the trap, you'll find him.

3016
03:35:02,626 --> 03:35:04,149
TALIESIN: I've already moved him.

3017
03:35:04,149 --> 03:35:06,463
MARISHA: Percy will tell you where he is.

3018
03:35:06,463 --> 03:35:08,098
TALIESIN: It's in the scroll.

3019
03:35:08,098 --> 03:35:09,828
MARISHA: Just read the directions.

3020
03:35:09,828 --> 03:35:15,981
MATT: As you read the scroll, glance over it, and
you may have seen this entity walking in their

3021
03:35:15,981 --> 03:35:22,412
vicinity once or twice during the time you met
them. It is a 12 foot tall stone golem. It is

3022
03:35:22,412 --> 03:35:28,177
explained in this that with the use of this
circlet, you have control over this creature.

3023
03:35:28,177 --> 03:35:44,887
PATRICK: The people of this town are-- you know
that they're grateful. The problem is, for some of

3024
03:35:44,887 --> 03:35:54,489
you, they may not be able to say that in a way
that you can hear right now. But know that they

3025
03:35:54,489 --> 03:36:00,081
are, and know that they will be for a long time.
And if I have anything to say about it, it will be

3026
03:36:00,081 --> 03:36:05,901
a very, very long time. So thank you. Thank you
for them, and thank you for me.

3027
03:36:05,901 --> 03:36:08,035
MARISHA: I give Kerr a big hug.

3028
03:36:08,035 --> 03:36:09,539
PATRICK: Free hug!

3029
03:36:09,539 --> 03:36:11,690
TALIESIN: I watch awkwardly.

3030
03:36:11,690 --> 03:36:16,819
MATT: You do. As you guys break your hug, you look
down.

3031
03:36:16,819 --> 03:36:18,706
MARISHA: I'm going to miss you, Kerr.

3032
03:36:18,706 --> 03:36:22,748
PATRICK: Well.

3033
03:36:22,748 --> 03:36:24,885
MARISHA: No, it's okay, you don't have to say it
back.

3034
03:36:24,885 --> 03:36:36,977
PATRICK: You know where I am. It could be that I
will see you before too long. Some of us have more

3035
03:36:36,977 --> 03:36:38,649
time than others, of course.

3036
03:36:38,649 --> 03:36:41,594
MARISHA: I'm sure I will see you at some point
later.

3037
03:36:41,594 --> 03:36:48,481
MATT: As you step away and turn back to the wall,
which is mostly done carving with the names and

3038
03:36:48,481 --> 03:36:54,339
the story bits you and Percy have been working on
during this time, that child has returned, and is

3039
03:36:54,339 --> 03:36:58,028
still drawing with the chalk, and as you look down
at the stick figures, you can see one with

3040
03:36:58,028 --> 03:37:04,336
antlers, two that are smaller than the others, one
that is larger than the rest, burlier, thicker

3041
03:37:04,336 --> 03:37:12,270
around the chest, one that you can barely see, and
one that flies across them all on a broom. And

3042
03:37:12,270 --> 03:37:18,139
then, at the very end, just finishing, one with
funny glasses. The kid stands up and looks at it

3043
03:37:18,139 --> 03:37:23,176
once and goes, "It's done!" And then runs off.

3044
03:37:23,176 --> 03:37:27,819
TALIESIN: Oh, dear.

3045
03:37:27,819 --> 03:37:33,137
LAURA: I just take a little piece of chalk and I
add Trinket right on the other side.

3046
03:37:33,137 --> 03:37:37,663
MATT: Much better drawn than the rest of them.

3047
03:37:37,663 --> 03:37:42,269
LAURA: Almost perfect. Almost perfect.

3048
03:37:42,269 --> 03:37:44,470
TALIESIN: I can be right every now and then.

3049
03:37:44,470 --> 03:37:45,768
MARISHA: I hate you.

3050
03:37:45,768 --> 03:37:49,589
MATT: (laughs) So what's your next step?

3051
03:37:49,589 --> 03:37:55,022
SAM: We have more Vestiges to get. An airship to
steal.

3052
03:37:55,022 --> 03:37:56,450
TALIESIN: Yes!

3053
03:37:56,450 --> 03:37:57,569
MARISHA: No.

3054
03:37:57,569 --> 03:37:58,598
TALIESIN: Please?

3055
03:37:58,598 --> 03:37:59,579
ASHLEY: Vasselheim?

3056
03:37:59,579 --> 03:38:01,160
LIAM: I have to go to Vasselheim.

3057
03:38:01,160 --> 03:38:05,078
LAURA: Vasselheim is so far away, and the Feywild
is so very close.

3058
03:38:05,078 --> 03:38:07,946
MARISHA: I have to go to the water tribe of the
Ashari.

3059
03:38:07,946 --> 03:38:09,890
TRAVIS: The Feywild is close.

3060
03:38:09,890 --> 03:38:14,701
LIAM: I have to go to Vasselheim now, and I will
go on my own if I have to.

3061
03:38:14,701 --> 03:38:16,513
SAM: Why?

3062
03:38:16,513 --> 03:38:20,320
TALIESIN: Oh, that's why.

3063
03:38:20,320 --> 03:38:27,587
MATT: You have many avenues at your disposal. You
have to come up with some central choice here.

3064
03:38:27,587 --> 03:38:32,886
There's also Whitestone, which you guys haven't
been to in a while yet to check in with anybody.

3065
03:38:32,886 --> 03:38:41,160
There's definitely where all the Vestiges are
currently held. There is all those locations. So

3066
03:38:41,160 --> 03:38:43,824
what is your next step in the journey?

3067
03:38:43,824 --> 03:38:47,086
MARISHA: Why do you need to go back to Vasselheim?
Right now?

3068
03:38:47,086 --> 03:38:51,923
LIAM: I'm not done with her.

3069
03:38:51,923 --> 03:38:54,481
ASHLEY: I think I know why he needs to go back to
Vasselheim.

3070
03:38:54,481 --> 03:38:56,361
TRAVIS: Why?

3071
03:38:56,361 --> 03:38:58,739
ASHLEY: It's not my place to say.

3072
03:38:58,739 --> 03:39:12,993
LIAM: I have to go now. Whether it's just me--
Pike, I would be grateful if you would go with me.

3073
03:39:12,993 --> 03:39:17,884
LAURA: Well, I'm going with you, too.

3074
03:39:17,884 --> 03:39:24,319
LIAM: I don't think that this is somewhere that
you can go with me.

3075
03:39:24,319 --> 03:39:27,803
LAURA: Vasselheim? I've been there.

3076
03:39:27,803 --> 03:39:35,827
LIAM: Yes, you can go to Vasselheim, but what I
have to do there, I don't want you to have any

3077
03:39:35,827 --> 03:39:40,524
part of it. Just this. Just this one thing.

3078
03:39:40,524 --> 03:39:46,708
LAURA: Well, then I'll go to Vasselheim and I'll
wait outside.

3079
03:39:46,708 --> 03:39:49,289
LIAM: I need you.

3080
03:39:49,289 --> 03:40:11,375
ASHLEY: I take him and I pull him aside. I know
that you've been avoiding me. And I just have to

3081
03:40:11,375 --> 03:40:20,986
say, I don't know who this-- I don't know who or
what this Raven Queen is, and I think that's what

3082
03:40:20,986 --> 03:40:30,472
scares me the most. But I know if you're choosing
a life of faith or whatever you want this to be,

3083
03:40:30,472 --> 03:40:38,615
I'm happy for you.

3084
03:40:38,615 --> 03:40:47,863
LIAM: I take her by the hand and I pull her
further away. Much further away. Did the others

3085
03:40:47,863 --> 03:40:52,782
tell you what happened in the tomb? In the sunken
tomb?

3086
03:40:52,782 --> 03:40:56,358
ASHLEY: I'm getting bits and pieces.

3087
03:40:56,358 --> 03:41:15,882
LIAM: I have been avoiding you. Percival-- There
was a trap, and Vex'ahlia-- I almost lost

3088
03:41:15,882 --> 03:41:30,368
Vex'ahlia, and a woman appeared. Not a woman. A
god appeared. She appeared, and I did something. I

3089
03:41:30,368 --> 03:41:35,545
tried to save my sister. I did something stupid. I
tried to bargain. I didn't even fucking want the

3090
03:41:35,545 --> 03:41:44,971
armor that I'm wearing right now! I didn't want
it. I don't think I've ever told you how much I

3091
03:41:44,971 --> 03:41:46,459
admire you.

3092
03:41:46,459 --> 03:41:48,019
ASHLEY: Vax.

3093
03:41:48,019 --> 03:41:58,985
LIAM: I always have. You have a kindness about you
that comes with such ease and honesty. You have

3094
03:41:58,985 --> 03:42:10,967
always carried a light. Her light. I think, you
know, I admire everyone in our band of misfit

3095
03:42:10,967 --> 03:42:22,442
toys, but you most of all, and when you left, we
all noticed its absence. All of us. I think I

3096
03:42:22,442 --> 03:42:34,920
wanted to find it again for myself. Hers. Your
benefactor. I felt Her, and I told myself that

3097
03:42:34,920 --> 03:42:42,270
when you came back, I was going to come to you and
I was going to learn from you, and follow you and

3098
03:42:42,270 --> 03:42:54,546
follow Her. As soon as you came back. And like so
many things that I reach for in this life, it

3099
03:42:54,546 --> 03:43:09,487
slipped through my fingers, and I've gone and
painted myself into a corner. I can't anymore. And

3100
03:43:09,487 --> 03:43:17,689
I think when I saw you, it was just a reminder of
what I lost. I'm sorry for avoiding you.

3101
03:43:17,689 --> 03:43:36,616
ASHLEY: Don't be sorry. I understand now. And I
don't think that you're lost in any way. I think

3102
03:43:36,616 --> 03:43:43,270
if you felt in some way that this is who you've
needed to follow, then follow her.

3103
03:43:43,270 --> 03:43:51,846
LIAM: Well, the bottom line is I couldn't walk
away if I wanted to, because I know that I would

3104
03:43:51,846 --> 03:44:04,055
lose my sister. But I don't want to anymore. We've
all been close to death, all of us, and now I'm

3105
03:44:04,055 --> 03:44:17,019
just a little bit closer. It took me a bit, but
maybe we're not meant to be happy. I don't know.

3106
03:44:17,019 --> 03:44:21,112
ASHLEY: I don't think that's true.

3107
03:44:21,112 --> 03:44:24,764
LIAM: Well, I don't know. But I know that I can be
of use.

3108
03:44:24,764 --> 03:44:35,771
ASHLEY: You can be, and you are of use. I'm not
the type of person who would ever say that you

3109
03:44:35,771 --> 03:44:48,658
have to choose and follow who I follow, but I will
tell you now that if the Raven Queen fucks with

3110
03:44:48,658 --> 03:44:58,545
you, or hurts you, or doesn't change you for the
better, then she's going to have to deal with me,

3111
03:44:58,545 --> 03:45:14,532
and we're going to have a problem. But as of right
now, I love you, Vax. It is going to be fine, and

3112
03:45:14,532 --> 03:45:18,881
I am here for you, no matter what, and you can
talk to me any time. Don't be ashamed or

3113
03:45:18,881 --> 03:45:21,257
embarrassed.

3114
03:45:21,257 --> 03:45:26,361
LIAM: I was. I'm doing better.

3115
03:45:26,361 --> 03:45:31,422
ASHLEY: Okay. Don't be ashamed. And turn that
frown upside down.

3116
03:45:31,422 --> 03:45:36,574
LIAM: It would help if you stayed around.

3117
03:45:36,574 --> 03:45:45,215
ASHLEY: I will do my best. Sometimes people call,
and sometimes I just have to go to do work.

3118
03:45:45,215 --> 03:45:49,280
(laughter)

3119
03:45:49,280 --> 03:45:52,330
ASHLEY: But maybe you'll discover that with the
Raven Queen. Maybe she'll take you to jobs and you

3120
03:45:52,330 --> 03:45:53,979
just have to go.

3121
03:45:53,979 --> 03:45:55,556
SAM: Prime Time.

3122
03:45:55,556 --> 03:46:03,323
ASHLEY: But I adore you. Okay?

3123
03:46:03,323 --> 03:46:07,511
LIAM: I was all kinds of fucked up a couple of
weeks ago.

3124
03:46:07,511 --> 03:46:13,558
ASHLEY: Well, you are all kinds of fucked up all
the time, and that's why we love you. We're all

3125
03:46:13,558 --> 03:46:18,063
all kinds of fucked up, and that's why we all are
together.

3126
03:46:18,063 --> 03:46:21,278
SAM: I walk by, eating chicken and wearing no
pants.

3127
03:46:21,278 --> 03:46:34,075
ASHLEY: See? And I give him a slap on his bare ass
as he walks by. You okay? You will be.

3128
03:46:34,075 --> 03:46:35,281
LIAM: Ish.

3129
03:46:35,281 --> 03:46:39,899
ASHLEY: Ish. That's all we can be, is ish. Okay?

3130
03:46:39,899 --> 03:46:41,157
LIAM: Okay.

3131
03:46:41,157 --> 03:46:42,770
ASHLEY: Okay.

3132
03:46:42,770 --> 03:46:44,450
SAM: To the Feywild!

3133
03:46:44,450 --> 03:46:46,046
MATT: To where?

3134
03:46:46,046 --> 03:46:48,273
SAM: He needs a destination.

3135
03:46:48,273 --> 03:46:51,680
MATT: What is your next plan of action?

3136
03:46:51,680 --> 03:46:54,916
LIAM: I'm going to Vasselheim.

3137
03:46:54,916 --> 03:46:58,219
SAM: God damn it. To Vasselheim!

3138
03:46:58,219 --> 03:47:00,953
LAURA: To Vasselheim, then.

3139
03:47:00,953 --> 03:47:03,916
TALIESIN: If emo elf is going to Vasselheim, we're
going to Vasselheim.

3140
03:47:03,916 --> 03:47:05,731
LIAM: You can go. I can catch up.

3141
03:47:05,731 --> 03:47:07,791
TRAVIS: You can't go by yourself.

3142
03:47:07,791 --> 03:47:10,487
SAM: Well, we have the rocks. We could send a rock
with him.

3143
03:47:10,487 --> 03:47:15,346
LAURA: That's fucking stupid. I'm going. I
wouldn't let him go to Vasselheim.

3144
03:47:15,346 --> 03:47:17,222
TRAVIS: We're all going to Vasselheim.

3145
03:47:17,222 --> 03:47:18,887
TALIESIN: I have things I can do in Vasselheim.

3146
03:47:18,887 --> 03:47:22,882
LIAM: It's the only bastion of standing
civilization left.

3147
03:47:22,882 --> 03:47:24,881
SAM: Is Feywild on the way?

3148
03:47:24,881 --> 03:47:25,926
LAURA: No.

3149
03:47:25,926 --> 03:47:28,332
MARISHA: No, it's in the opposite direction. It's
south of here.

3150
03:47:28,332 --> 03:47:33,132
MATT: The Feywild is ever-present, technically.
It's another plane.

3151
03:47:33,132 --> 03:47:36,583
SAM: Oh, let's go on the way. It's like on the
way, practically.

3152
03:47:36,583 --> 03:47:39,280
LAURA: No, we know an entrance to the Feywild in
the Frostweald.

3153
03:47:39,280 --> 03:47:42,087
MATT: There are many doors to the Feywild
throughout the world. You just only know one.

3154
03:47:42,087 --> 03:47:44,111
SAM: Let's just let Vax go by himself.

3155
03:47:44,111 --> 03:47:45,388
LAURA: No.

3156
03:47:45,388 --> 03:47:48,114
TALIESIN: No, there's actually things that can be
done in Vasselheim.

3157
03:47:48,114 --> 03:47:49,891
MARISHA: I pull Vax aside.

3158
03:47:49,891 --> 03:47:51,392
TRAVIS: Christ.

3159
03:47:51,392 --> 03:47:57,462
LIAM: Hey, you had two hours to beat the shit out
of a goliath! Sit tight, buddy.

3160
03:47:57,462 --> 03:48:02,113
SAM: I pull Kerr aside.

3161
03:48:02,113 --> 03:48:05,525
LAURA: I pull Grog aside.

3162
03:48:05,525 --> 03:48:07,644
TALIESIN: I walk away.

3163
03:48:07,644 --> 03:48:12,033
LIAM: Catch phrase! Catch phrase! Meme! Tweet
tweet tweet!

3164
03:48:12,033 --> 03:48:16,322
MATT: All right, so. As Keyleth pulls you aside.

3165
03:48:16,322 --> 03:48:23,213
MARISHA: Do you want to go alone? Do you want to
go by yourself? Because if you want to go by

3166
03:48:23,213 --> 03:48:29,392
yourself, say something, and we'll let you go. If
you think this is something you need to do by

3167
03:48:29,392 --> 03:48:30,995
yourself.

3168
03:48:30,995 --> 03:48:37,083
LIAM: I'm actually scared shitless, and I would
like Pike and you to go with me. I would like my

3169
03:48:37,083 --> 03:48:47,070
sister not to go anywhere near her. That's what I
would like, and that's it. You and Pike.

3170
03:48:47,070 --> 03:48:49,543
MARISHA: Then say something.

3171
03:48:49,543 --> 03:48:51,965
LIAM: I did.

3172
03:48:51,965 --> 03:48:53,714
MARISHA: No, you didn't.

3173
03:48:53,714 --> 03:48:59,113
LIAM: Hey, I'd like to go to Vasselheim, Pike.
Keyleth, can you open up a hole in a tree? We can

3174
03:48:59,113 --> 03:49:03,833
go quick. Everyone can go to Vasselheim. There's
just a specific place in Vasselheim that I need to

3175
03:49:03,833 --> 03:49:12,459
go. And I love you, but I just don't want you to
be a part of it. You either hang out with Grog, or

3176
03:49:12,459 --> 03:49:14,457
stay outside, okay?

3177
03:49:14,457 --> 03:49:16,171
LAURA: Fine.

3178
03:49:16,171 --> 03:49:17,454
LIAM: Okay.

3179
03:49:17,454 --> 03:49:19,233
SAM: To Vasselheim!

3180
03:49:19,233 --> 03:49:20,629
MARISHA: To Vasselheim.

3181
03:49:20,629 --> 03:49:22,726
TALIESIN: To outside a building in Vasselheim.

3182
03:49:22,726 --> 03:49:23,744
MATT: Indeed.

3183
03:49:23,744 --> 03:49:29,633
MARISHA: To a far wooded area where magic is
permissible, outside of Vasselheim.

3184
03:49:29,633 --> 03:49:34,651
MATT: Divine magic is permissible. The essence of
pulling magic beyond the powers. It's the arcane

3185
03:49:34,651 --> 03:49:38,444
practitioning that is frowned upon. It's not
illegal. It's just generally frowned upon.

3186
03:49:38,444 --> 03:49:40,333
TALIESIN: It's rude.

3187
03:49:40,333 --> 03:49:47,465
MATT: But yes, as you step back to the surface
beyond the subterranean personnel bunker that is

3188
03:49:47,465 --> 03:49:53,923
now the sewage system of Westruun, you find
yourself at a nearby tree. The doorway opens, and

3189
03:49:53,923 --> 03:50:02,324
you all dart through into the cold, snow-dappled,
cobbled streets of Vasselheim.

3190
03:50:02,324 --> 03:50:09,656
And that's where we'll end tonight's game. Picking
up next week, at that moment. Thank you guys so

3191
03:50:09,656 --> 03:50:14,684
much, that was a great session! Dude, Patrick,
thank you so much for joining us!

3192
03:50:14,684 --> 03:50:16,855
MARISHA: Patrick, my new best friend!

3193
03:50:16,855 --> 03:50:19,073
LAURA: Thanks, Kerr Bear!

3194
03:50:19,073 --> 03:50:23,998
PATRICK: Thanks so much for having me. I've been a
fan for a long time. It was a real treat.

3195
03:50:23,998 --> 03:50:26,279
MATT: Dude, our pleasure, man. Thanks for coming.

3196
03:50:26,279 --> 03:50:28,543
ASHELY: As we have been of you.

3197
03:50:28,543 --> 03:50:30,429
MARISHA: Kerr Bear Share!

3198
03:50:30,429 --> 03:50:31,731
LAURA: And thanks, Loot Crate!

3199
03:50:31,731 --> 03:50:35,175
MATT: And thanks Loot Crate, for deciding to
sponsor us again! And thank you guys for being so

3200
03:50:35,175 --> 03:50:39,086
supportive of us having sponsors now! It's really,
really helpful.

3201
03:50:39,086 --> 03:50:41,226
TRAVIS: Use the link! Show your Critter power!

3202
03:50:41,226 --> 03:50:43,335
MARISHA: It makes us feel like we're a grown up
show now.

3203
03:50:43,335 --> 03:50:46,434
TALIESIN: We're a real Twitch stream!

3204
03:50:46,434 --> 03:50:48,524
MARISHA: We're a real Twitch stream with
sponsors!

3205
03:50:48,524 --> 03:50:52,131
PATRICK: Is it gauche if I mention a thing that's
going on?

3206
03:50:52,131 --> 03:50:53,560
MATT: Yes, please, go for it!

3207
03:50:53,560 --> 03:50:55,258
SAM: What are you, a sellout? Come on, man.

3208
03:50:55,258 --> 03:50:58,760
PATRICK: There's a subtle difference between
selling and selling out.

3209
03:50:58,760 --> 03:51:00,475
MATT: Exactly. You're fine.

3210
03:51:00,475 --> 03:51:09,425
PATRICK: And I'm constantly pushing that border. I
run a charity called World Builders, and we raise

3211
03:51:09,425 --> 03:51:15,923
money to support various charities. We rally the
geek community, and right now we're running our

3212
03:51:15,923 --> 03:51:23,278
midseason fundraiser. It's an Indiegogo with a
bunch of cool things that geeks might like. We

3213
03:51:23,278 --> 03:51:28,386
teamed up with Rat Queens. We're doing a T-shirt
for them. If you're a fan of the Dresden Files,

3214
03:51:28,386 --> 03:51:36,913
we've got a T-shirt based on Harry Dresden and
those books. We've got a T-shirt based on my

3215
03:51:36,913 --> 03:51:42,166
books. We've got, literally, there's 40 items
there, a bunch of different cool geekery of

3216
03:51:42,166 --> 03:51:49,967
various sorts. For those of you that have read The
Slow Regard of Silent Things, they pulled off a

3217
03:51:49,967 --> 03:51:57,565
foxen night light. It looks beautiful. I should've
brought the prototype so I could show it to you. I

3218
03:51:57,565 --> 03:52:01,432
should've brought the prototype, but it turned out
so good.

3219
03:52:01,432 --> 03:52:02,742
LAURA: I'm going to look it up.

3220
03:52:02,742 --> 03:52:11,325
PATRICK: The thing is, it only lasts for four more
days. This is just a weeklong fundraiser. You can

3221
03:52:11,325 --> 03:52:19,020
get coffee, you can get hoodies, you can get a
bunch of these things, and all the money goes to

3222
03:52:19,020 --> 03:52:25,800
charity. If you're interested, swing on by and
take a peek at what we've got. If there's any of

3223
03:52:25,800 --> 03:52:30,491
my people in the Twitch stream, which I'm guessing
there are, you can throw a link up there so other

3224
03:52:30,491 --> 03:52:31,649
people can see it.

3225
03:52:31,649 --> 03:52:32,963
TALIESIN: What's that web address again?

3226
03:52:32,963 --> 03:52:40,468
PATRICK: If you search on worldbuilders.org,
that's our main web page. This fundraiser in

3227
03:52:40,468 --> 03:52:42,995
particular is happening on Indiegogo.

3228
03:52:42,995 --> 03:52:46,085
LAURA: Plus there's a link in your Twitter
account, right?

3229
03:52:46,085 --> 03:52:50,154
PATRICK: Yeah, I've been talking about it in my
Twitter account, and I do occasionally Twitch

3230
03:52:50,154 --> 03:52:53,455
stream, too, and I throw up the link there as
well.

3231
03:52:53,455 --> 03:52:55,556
MATT: And what is your Twitter account, just so
folks know?

3232
03:52:55,556 --> 03:52:59,337
PATRICK: @patrickrothfuss, just all together.

3233
03:52:59,337 --> 03:53:07,863
MATT: Perfect. Fantastic. Thank you guys again, a
great session tonight, and yeah. I guess we'll see

3234
03:53:07,863 --> 03:53:14,360
you guys in a week. Until then, we ask ourselves:
Is it Thursday yet? Have a good night, guys!
