1
00:00:00,536 --> 00:00:04,141
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to Critical
Role, the show where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice

2
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:09,626
actors get together, roll dice, and play Dungeons
and Dragons. My name is Matthew Mercer, I'm the

3
00:00:09,626 --> 00:00:14,140
Dungeon Master of the game. Welcome, new folks who
haven't seen this before, hope you're not too

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:19,784
lost, and returning Team Hooman and Critter fans,
welcome back, we love having you and let's get

5
00:00:19,784 --> 00:00:22,324
this evening on the road. We have some
announcements and things to talk about before the

6
00:00:22,324 --> 00:00:27,315
game actually kicks in, so we'll first pass it
over here to our fantastic overlord

7
00:00:27,315 --> 00:00:28,386
to get that kicked off.

8
00:00:28,386 --> 00:00:31,045
ZAC: That's right, you get to see my ugly face for
a couple minutes while I get through a couple

9
00:00:31,045 --> 00:00:35,785
quick announcements, guys. A lot of you have been
asking me on Twitter and in the chat room when you

10
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:42,316
will get to see Critical Troll? That will be up on
the website tomorrow night at 8PM Pacific Standard

11
00:00:42,316 --> 00:00:47,208
Time. So go over to the website at 8PM, you'll be
able to see that and I'm sure you guys will

12
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:50,626
secretly pass around the youtube link and stuff.

13
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,474
MATT: Watch me go crazy.

14
00:00:52,474 --> 00:00:55,791
ZAC: Currently you can find Laura's article on
GeekandSundry.com.

15
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:56,788
LAURA: What?!

16
00:00:56,788 --> 00:01:00,611
ZAC: That came out today, so make sure to head
over to the website and read that. And I know a

17
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:06,753
lot of you are probably wondering about D&amp;Diesel.
Which is apparently the name, D&amp;Diesel.

18
00:01:06,753 --> 00:01:07,644
LAURA: Yeah, it is.

19
00:01:07,644 --> 00:01:08,479
ZAC: Got a ring to it.

20
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,472
TALIESIN: Hashtag D&amp;Diesel.

21
00:01:09,472 --> 00:01:14,063
ZAC: Hashtag D&amp;Diesel. That will be showing
tonight during the midpoint of the show. Now,

22
00:01:14,063 --> 00:01:18,908
there's a couple special things with this showing,
you need to watch it live. If you think that

23
00:01:18,908 --> 00:01:22,821
you're going to come back later, watch it on the
rebroadcast, and you're gonna go dip out for a pee

24
00:01:22,821 --> 00:01:28,615
break or pizza break, whatever, don't! Stick around
because after it shows tonight live, you will

25
00:01:28,615 --> 00:01:33,091
be unable to see it again until Monday on the
website. So it will be cut from the rebroadcasts.

26
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:34,225
LAURA: Whoa.

27
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:38,352
ZAC: And I'm very sorry to our European audience.
I'm really sorry about that, but that's just

28
00:01:38,352 --> 00:01:44,293
unfortunately how PR deals work sometimes and
that's just the way it is. But, it'll only be--

29
00:01:44,293 --> 00:01:45,343
MATT: It's only a few days!

30
00:01:45,343 --> 00:01:48,775
ZAC: Yeah, it'll only be a few days and you'll get
to see a lot more on Monday. A longer cut and

31
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,976
that's why it's a website exclusive. It's longer,
it'll have some tightening and all sorts of other

32
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:56,496
stuff. But, you guys get a special treat tonight
with a preview showing, and it's still a long

33
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:59,093
preview, it's like 20-25 minutes or something like
that.

34
00:01:59,093 --> 00:02:00,143
LAURA: Whoa, it is?

35
00:02:00,143 --> 00:02:00,934
MATT: Yeah.

36
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:01,710
ZAC: It's pretty cool.

37
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,378
MATT: That'll be exciting.

38
00:02:03,378 --> 00:02:09,307
ZAC: So there's that. Tomorrow we have a very
special event happening for all of those that

39
00:02:09,307 --> 00:02:13,851
joined us for the Extra Life campaign, thank you
so much, and a lot of you guys were here as well.

40
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,366
MATT: Yes indeed.

41
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:19,436
ZAC: And thank you for donating, getting us well
past our goal, and as some of you may remember

42
00:02:19,436 --> 00:02:24,170
during Critical Troll, Felicia mentioned that if
we reached a certain goal, she would come on, on a

43
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:29,044
scheduled date and play Rock Band 4. So that's
happening, tomorrow.

44
00:02:29,044 --> 00:02:29,940
MATT: Yup!

45
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,380
ZAC: We are having a battle of the bands from 5 to
7PM Pacific Standard Time, and Mr. Mercer here is

46
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,431
going to be playing the drums.

47
00:02:36,431 --> 00:02:43,978
MATT: Yeah, I'm drumming for them, which, first
off, I haven't played since probably 2011,

48
00:02:43,978 --> 00:02:47,364
and I'm a little rusty.

49
00:02:47,364 --> 00:02:49,567
ZAC: Have you seen your competition?

50
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:52,127
MATT: No, but I assume they're gonna destroy me.

51
00:02:52,127 --> 00:02:53,329
ZAC: They're really good.

52
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:54,929
MATT: That's okay. I will narrate my failure.

53
00:02:54,929 --> 00:02:55,847
ZAC: There we go!

54
00:02:55,847 --> 00:02:57,427
MATT: In a way that will still be as engrossing.
(laughs)

55
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,201
ZAC: And there's been a Twitter battle happening
between the two teams.

56
00:03:00,201 --> 00:03:01,295
MATT: Oh really?

57
00:03:01,295 --> 00:03:05,807
ZAC: You're kinda walking into the fire, my
friend.

58
00:03:05,807 --> 00:03:06,923
MATT: That's okay.

59
00:03:06,923 --> 00:03:08,692
ZAC: Felicia's put a lot on the line for you guy's
team.

60
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:10,391
MATT: That's cool. I got fire resistance. That's
fine.

61
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:14,058
ZAC: Okay cool, cool. That'll be happening
tomorrow 5PM to 7PM Pacific Standard Time, you

62
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:17,351
guys should tune in for that. We are still going to
be donating to Extra Life, but we're not really

63
00:03:17,395 --> 00:03:21,986
going to be pushing it, it's more of a reward for
you guys for helping us get past that $75k goal.

64
00:03:21,986 --> 00:03:23,426
MATT: Yes.

65
00:03:23,426 --> 00:03:27,734
ZAC: Our next giveaway is going to be at 9,500,
we're getting pretty close. The other real quick

66
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,787
little announcement I have as far as subs go, is
last week you guys were able to get our sub train

67
00:03:32,787 --> 00:03:39,809
up to 420 subs, now that counts resubs and new
subs. So we have the sub train going right now, I

68
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:41,830
believe it's well over a hundred--

69
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,753
MATT: Woof.

70
00:03:42,753 --> 00:03:46,541
ZAC: If we break last week's record of 420 which I
think they purposely stopped at 420--

71
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,938
MATT: (laughs) Of course they did.

72
00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:54,103
ZAC: Hey guys, don't go. We will do a giant
giveaway of board games, D&amp;D stuff signed by the

73
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:59,025
cast, signed by the rest of the Twitch crew. We'll
throw in a couple video games, t-shirts, all sorts

74
00:03:59,025 --> 00:04:04,647
of stuff. Plus Ivan has said if we reach that goal
for TPK, which those that watched last Monday,

75
00:04:04,647 --> 00:04:05,702
thank you so much.

76
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:06,642
MATT: Yeah!

77
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:11,100
ZAC: It's a new show on Monday nights where our
Twitch cast plays as themself in Outbreak Undead.

78
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:18,652
Last week, some of you saw the Twitch cast leave
me for dead outside of the studio. And a lot of

79
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:23,558
people thought that I might come back if given the
opportunity. Well, if we break that sub goal, Ivan

80
00:04:23,558 --> 00:04:27,893
has said that I will come back and probably wreak
havoc in some way for our Twitch host that thought

81
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:31,305
they could get away with leaving me for dead in
the middle of the street.

82
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:32,614
MATT: (laughs) That's awesome.

83
00:04:32,614 --> 00:04:38,635
ZAC: So let's break 420. The last announcement,
guys, is just a real quick community announcement.

84
00:04:38,635 --> 00:04:44,133
We like to pride ourselves at Geek &amp; Sundry for
being a very open and loving and warm community,

85
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:49,490
and that's absolutely the most important thing to
us and to Felicia and to a lot of our viewers, and

86
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,065
I know last week things got a little heated in the
chat room, and we just want to remind everyone

87
00:04:53,065 --> 00:04:57,592
that we don't get the opportunity to talk to you
much during the show, but we want to make sure you

88
00:04:57,592 --> 00:05:02,725
guys stay as positive as possible or I will have
to throw the hammer down on you.

89
00:05:02,725 --> 00:05:05,061
MATT: Shit. All right. There you--

90
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:06,439
ZAC: That's pretty much it.

91
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,719
MATT: You know, just goes to say that this
community is built on so many great, positive

92
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:14,130
people and such a wonderful sense of community,
and a big huge thanks and please share

93
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,801
appreciation for our fantastic mods who work
consistently and constantly throughout the day.

94
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:19,795
ZAC: (sings) For free.

95
00:05:19,795 --> 00:05:20,869
MATT: For free.

96
00:05:20,869 --> 00:05:22,654
ZAC: (laughs) You guys are crazy.

97
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:25,342
MATT: Through our chatroom, which if you've
watched, as you're now seeing and have seen

98
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:30,382
previous episodes, is I can only assume readable
by super mastermind computers at this point. So,

99
00:05:30,382 --> 00:05:34,465
you guys do an amazing job, it's really
appreciated and to all of you guys out there in

100
00:05:34,465 --> 00:05:40,551
the community, keep that positivity, keep that
understanding, and enjoy our game for its ups, for

101
00:05:40,551 --> 00:05:45,011
its downs, for our good character choices, bad
character choices. It's all an experience in a

102
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:52,144
story that we're all having together at the same
time. So, kick along, hold on, and keep smiling.

103
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,065
ZAC: Well said, Matt.

104
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:53,895
MATT: Yeah, thank you.

105
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,060
ZAC: We love you guys, kind of.

106
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,968
(all laugh)

107
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:57,649
MATT: I do. I love you. We do.

108
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,734
ZAC: I'm on the fence.

109
00:05:58,734 --> 00:05:59,668
MATT: He's a-- you know.

110
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:00,877
LAURA: We love you so much!

111
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:07,978
MATT: It's a thing. So yeah, so, couple other
announcements for you guys. What's our sub count

112
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:10,851
right now? When's our next one hundred?

113
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:14,220
CREW: 9.5k, 9,500.

114
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:22,167
MATT: At 9,500 we will be giving away our signed
photo and signed art piece by Kit Buss to a random

115
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:26,260
person who's active in the chat. So next time we
hit that goal, we'll have that giveaway, which is

116
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:32,188
awesome. Once again, Extra Life has been our big
charity push right now. Everyone who's given,

117
00:06:32,188 --> 00:06:38,507
thank you so much. So, so much, and if ever you
want to be a part of helping that out we have the

118
00:06:38,507 --> 00:06:45,451
information there available for you, it goes to a
really great cause. Let's see, Sam will be here

119
00:06:45,451 --> 00:06:50,106
shortly. Unfortunately, we're down a Tiberius
tonight. However, yesterday was Orion's birthday,

120
00:06:50,106 --> 00:06:52,474
so feel free to go ahead and wish him a happy
birthday on Twitter.

121
00:06:52,474 --> 00:06:53,164
LAURA: Aw.

122
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:54,050
LIAM: Happy birthday, Orion.

123
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,248
TRAVIS: Happy birthday, buddy.

124
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:59,378
MATT: Happy birthday, Orion. But yeah, Sam should
be here shortly. And, let's see, do we have any

125
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:00,854
project announcements?

126
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,076
LIAM: Just a project announcement?

127
00:07:02,076 --> 00:07:03,396
MATT: Or any other announcements you've got.

128
00:07:03,396 --> 00:07:06,784
LIAM: Hey, yesterday I started directing for the
World of Warcraft. So that's pretty good.

129
00:07:06,784 --> 00:07:07,718
LAURA: You did?

130
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:08,872
(all cheer)

131
00:07:08,872 --> 00:07:09,757
MATT: Congratulations, buddy.

132
00:07:09,757 --> 00:07:10,805
LAURA: That's so great!

133
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,928
LIAM: I think it's gonna be ongoing and it was
really nice.

134
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:14,950
TRAVIS: Big deal.

135
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:15,832
MARISHA: I'm so excited for you!

136
00:07:15,832 --> 00:07:16,571
LAURA: That's super exciting.

137
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:17,408
MATT: That's awesome.

138
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:19,093
LIAM: Then anything right now?

139
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:20,063
MARISHA: I'm so fangirly.

140
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,856
MATT: Anything you want.

141
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:25,253
LIAM: All right, I also want to thank Pupgames
from Twitter for sending me this.

142
00:07:25,253 --> 00:07:26,652
LAURA: Oh yeah.

143
00:07:26,652 --> 00:07:31,236
LIAM: Look at this. It came in the mail separate
and I have a hood and now I can just, you know, I

144
00:07:31,236 --> 00:07:34,694
can go like that and no one will see me so thank
you, Pupgames.

145
00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:37,278
MATT: That's awesome!

146
00:07:37,278 --> 00:07:40,716
LIAM: Let me set it here. I haven't figured out
how to wear it exactly, but I will.

147
00:07:40,716 --> 00:07:41,780
LAURA and MATT: (laugh)

148
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,677
TRAVIS: Take all your clothes off and then figure
it out.

149
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:46,510
MATT: It's warm on the chesticles.

150
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:50,889
LIAM: And then, I just want to take a minute, I
said thank you on Twitter, but I just want to

151
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:58,197
thank everybody who for the last week has sent me
well-wishes and today who has sent me well-wishes,

152
00:07:58,197 --> 00:08:05,315
and a lot of the Critter community got together
and made a video just to, you know, just support,

153
00:08:05,315 --> 00:08:12,037
support me in-- I am having a hard moment in my
personal life, not gonna get into it, but you guys

154
00:08:12,037 --> 00:08:17,499
kind of took my breath away today for real. So,
thank you very much.

155
00:08:17,734 --> 00:08:19,355
TRAVIS: Yeah.

156
00:08:19,355 --> 00:08:20,745
MARISHA: We have the best fans.

157
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:23,331
MATT: This whole community is brilliant, so you
guys.

158
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:27,149
TALIESIN: So many of them in New York and in San
Francisco this week,

159
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:29,047
where we've been all over the place.

160
00:08:29,047 --> 00:08:31,710
MARISHA: Yes. Shout out to our New York and San
Fran.

161
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,608
MATT: Yeah, we hit both coasts.

162
00:08:33,608 --> 00:08:36,876
MARISHA: San Francisco. Both coasts.

163
00:08:36,876 --> 00:08:42,810
MATT: Yeah, in the same week. It's crazy. Yeah, we
all went to New York Comic Con. We had a panel

164
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,949
that went really well. We had a bunch of great
critters come out and Team Hooman folks come and

165
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:51,514
sit in the audience, ask questions. We had some
fun banter back and forth. We gave out 'Critical

166
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:54,593
Rolls,' these cookies that were our little meal
deal.

167
00:08:54,593 --> 00:08:56,660
TALIESIN: That were neither critical nor rolls,
really to be fair.

168
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,330
MATT: Right.

169
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,097
TALIESIN: But they were good.

170
00:08:58,097 --> 00:08:59,001
MARISHA: But we're into it.

171
00:08:59,001 --> 00:08:59,730
TALIESIN: Yeah.

172
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,332
MATT and MARISHA: Imaginary rolls.

173
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,784
MATT: Much like our realm is imaginary.

174
00:09:02,784 --> 00:09:05,167
TALIESIN: I may have hit a couple people in the
face, for which I greatly apologize.

175
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:07,129
LAURA: I definitely hit somebody in the face with
one of those rolls.

176
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,681
TALIESIN: Yeah, I like split someone's lip.

177
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,417
MATT: Completely unintentional, I'm sure.

178
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,598
LAURA: I'm so sorry.

179
00:09:11,598 --> 00:09:13,231
LIAM: Her aim is excellent. She never misses.

180
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:14,605
LAURA: Yes, I am an archer.

181
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:16,616
TRAVIS: She Hunter's Marks that shit.

182
00:09:16,616 --> 00:09:18,892
LAURA: I Hunter's Marked your face.

183
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,246
TALIESIN: And we played golf. It was quite nice.

184
00:09:20,246 --> 00:09:24,838
MATT: Also, thank you guys for coming out to that
event. Also, for those who came to see us at

185
00:09:24,838 --> 00:09:28,830
Forbidden Planet in New York, we had a great
turnout, and that comic shop wasn't quite

186
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,267
expecting what they were in for.

187
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:31,505
TRAVIS: We weren't expecting that.

188
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:33,536
MATT: We weren't expecting, but they especially
were like halfway through like, "Who are you

189
00:09:33,536 --> 00:09:36,259
"guys?! What is happening?!"

190
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:37,293
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah.

191
00:09:37,293 --> 00:09:38,213
TRAVIS: We are legion.

192
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:39,084
MARISHA: We freaked out our Uber driver.

193
00:09:39,084 --> 00:09:39,857
MATT: Yeah we did.

194
00:09:39,857 --> 00:09:40,372
TALIESIN: Yeah.

195
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,492
MATT: We pulled up and got out of the car and all
of a sudden it was like hundreds of people

196
00:09:42,492 --> 00:09:45,856
cheering and we all went "What?!" and the Uber
driver went "What?!?"

197
00:09:45,856 --> 00:09:48,276
TALIESIN: I think his exact words is, "Is this for
us?"

198
00:09:48,276 --> 00:09:50,147
(all laugh)

199
00:09:50,147 --> 00:09:51,502
MATT: And even we were like "I don't know."

200
00:09:51,502 --> 00:09:52,947
LAURA: I don't know!

201
00:09:52,947 --> 00:09:55,222
MATT: You guys were amazing. Thank you for that.

202
00:09:55,222 --> 00:09:59,167
MARISHA: I feel like we need to find and screen
cap in the thread where we were like, 20, 30

203
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:01,021
people, guys. Let's not get our hopes up.

204
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:01,910
LAURA: Yeah.

205
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,474
LIAM: Well, that's who got back to me, was like, I
don't know, 40ish.

206
00:10:04,474 --> 00:10:06,945
LAURA: Yeah, we thought it was gonna be like 40
people.

207
00:10:06,945 --> 00:10:08,590
MATT: Yeah, that was a good turnout.

208
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,012
LAURA: That-- pretty great. Was great. Pretty
great.

209
00:10:10,012 --> 00:10:11,116
LIAM: It was pretty metal.

210
00:10:11,116 --> 00:10:12,309
TALIESIN: The internet went, nope.

211
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:17,993
MATT: Yeah. Other announcements: Coming up in I
think the next couple weeks or so, the release of

212
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,252
the Minecraft Story Mode.

213
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,065
MARISHA: (whispers) Yeah.

214
00:10:21,065 --> 00:10:22,309
TRAVIS: (sings) Yeah.

215
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:25,898
MATT: Comes out on Xbox. Completely a fun show. We
went to the Archlight Let's Play of it they did,

216
00:10:25,898 --> 00:10:28,863
which was really a lot of fun. I play the
characters Aiden and Otis in it.

217
00:10:28,863 --> 00:10:30,733
MARISHA: Hundreds of screaming children.
Screaming, yeah.

218
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:33,531
MATT: Yes, lots of screaming children. Yeah, so I
play Aiden and Otis and a smattering of other

219
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:37,266
characters throughout. I think Sam also worked on
it. Anyone else?

220
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:39,476
ALL: Ashley.

221
00:10:39,476 --> 00:10:41,079
MATT: That's right, Ashley Johnson, our very own
Pike!

222
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:42,366
LIAM: She's one of the mains.

223
00:10:42,366 --> 00:10:46,160
MATT: Yeah, she's one of the main characters in
that show. So if you're a Minecraft fan and you

224
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,525
like Telltale and you have an Xbox, check it out.

225
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:52,861
LAURA: Speaking of Telltale, the final episode of
Tales from the Borderlands comes out next week.

226
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:53,889
TRAVIS: Oh snap!

227
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:54,762
LAURA: Episode five, what!

228
00:10:54,762 --> 00:10:56,459
TALIESIN: Yeah!

229
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:57,637
MATT: Awesome!

230
00:10:57,637 --> 00:10:58,585
LAURA: Exciting.

231
00:10:58,585 --> 00:10:59,472
MATT: (sings) Yeah.

232
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:05,087
TALIESIN: Also in that role, if any Critters are
in the Galveston area for Halloween, I will be at

233
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:13,256
OniCon over Halloween weekend. So, you can come
say hi in beautiful Galveston by the sea.

234
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,184
Galveston, Texas.

235
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:17,123
MATT: There you go.

236
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:19,238
TALIESIN: I'll be wearing a costume. It'll be
great.

237
00:11:19,238 --> 00:11:20,016
MATT: Perfect.

238
00:11:20,016 --> 00:11:21,015
LIAM: We have a gnome.

239
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:21,847
LAURA: We have a gnome.

240
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,453
TALIESIN: We have gnome? Oh god!

241
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:25,273
MARISHA: You're in Minecraft, right? Story mode.

242
00:11:25,273 --> 00:11:26,158
SAM: Yes I am.

243
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:26,797
MARISHA: Yeah.

244
00:11:26,797 --> 00:11:27,881
SAM: In fact you and I--

245
00:11:27,881 --> 00:11:29,164
MATT: I think we have a couple scenes together.

246
00:11:29,164 --> 00:11:33,018
SAM: We do something together, I don't know what.
Or you're playing a version of me or something,

247
00:11:33,018 --> 00:11:34,520
I don't remember.

248
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,237
MATT: I can only assume that it's tawdry.

249
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:42,257
SAM: (laughs) The director told me something about
you and I just assume we're probably having sex in

250
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:43,012
the game.

251
00:11:43,012 --> 00:11:43,919
MATT: Probably.

252
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,796
SAM: Yeah, okay.

253
00:11:44,796 --> 00:11:46,886
MATT: It's just like an extended, fully
interactive too. Talk about choices you make that

254
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:50,219
affect the storyline. (laughs)

255
00:11:50,219 --> 00:11:53,690
TALIESIN: I blank out in the booth any time they
mention his name.

256
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,913
MATT: But yeah, cool, guys. Any announcements
anyone want to talk about,

257
00:11:56,913 --> 00:11:59,047
or shall we get things started?

258
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:01,067
LAURA: Let's do it!

259
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:01,866
MATT: All right, let's do it.

260
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:02,512
MARISHA: Do it!

261
00:12:02,512 --> 00:12:03,403
LIAM: Wait, where did Grog go?

262
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:04,231
TALIESIN: Wait, wait, wait.

263
00:12:04,231 --> 00:12:04,728
SAM: He'll be here.

264
00:12:04,728 --> 00:12:07,606
MATT: Grog, he'll be here in a minute but in the
meantime, let's go ahead and dial in for the next

265
00:12:07,606 --> 00:12:09,000
episode of Critical Role.

266
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,894
TALIESIN: Dun dun dun dun.

267
00:12:09,894 --> 00:13:16,270
[opening credits]

268
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:26,977
MATT: Welcome back. So. Sh. (laughs) So, to go
over the current adventure in its current

269
00:13:26,977 --> 00:13:32,623
sequence, we have-- the party recently had an
encounter with the Briarwoods. Two individuals

270
00:13:32,623 --> 00:13:34,840
that were responsible for a lot of strife--

271
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,693
LIAM: Dicks!

272
00:13:35,693 --> 00:13:39,011
MATT: -- in the background of Percival's history.
Seemingly responsible for the destruction of his

273
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:47,303
entire family, and have for the past five years
been essentially ruling his home city and castle.

274
00:13:47,303 --> 00:13:53,255
They were out for a political banquet with
Sovereign Uriel in Emon and the party members of

275
00:13:53,255 --> 00:13:57,967
Vox Machina, they were all invited to be part of
this. Didn't quite go as planned. There was a

276
00:13:57,967 --> 00:14:03,719
scuffle and the Briarwoods absconded back to
Whitestone. They sent a couple assassins out to

277
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:10,268
attempt to take out their driver, who was spilling
information and essentially was going to be Vox

278
00:14:10,268 --> 00:14:16,589
Machina's way of being free of any sort of
political issues based on their actions that

279
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:24,891
evening, and after much discussion and preparation
and purchasing a lot of mirrors, the party took

280
00:14:24,891 --> 00:14:31,339
their transit over to the east-northeast towards
Whitestone, where they began to traverse the

281
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:38,453
Alabaster Sierras to the north, using the mountain
range as opposed to going directly through the

282
00:14:38,453 --> 00:14:44,909
forest. There they managed to avoid encountering a
bunch of harpies that were distracted by eating

283
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:46,396
the horses they left behind.

284
00:14:46,396 --> 00:14:47,304
TRAVIS: Damn.

285
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:51,075
MATT: They camped for the evening and began to
make their way through some sort of a mountainous

286
00:14:51,075 --> 00:14:57,399
valley that led in towards the forest surrounding
Whitestone. While they were traveling down this

287
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:02,568
pass, there was a rumbling, and some sort of
really fast, rapid-moving large blue creature that

288
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:09,146
leaped down in front, catching them off-guard. And
that is where we begin today.

289
00:15:09,146 --> 00:15:10,690
TRAVIS: Probably should have fucking researched
that creature.

290
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,983
TALIESIN: Did the creature look like that?

291
00:15:11,983 --> 00:15:12,857
MATT: That blue creature.

292
00:15:12,857 --> 00:15:13,846
LAURA: Yeah, right? That would have been smart.

293
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:14,492
TALIESIN: Okay, just checking.

294
00:15:14,492 --> 00:15:15,410
TRAVIS: I never do that.

295
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,530
LAURA: I know. So dumb.

296
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,455
SAM: What's dumb?

297
00:15:17,455 --> 00:15:18,220
TRAVIS: I have a question.

298
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,544
LAURA: That we didn't research that creature.

299
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,021
TRAVIS: What did you roll on your beard check?

300
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:21,867
MATT: What'd I roll on my beard check?

301
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:22,994
LAURA: I know, it's growing!

302
00:15:22,994 --> 00:15:23,917
MARISHA: It's metagaming, you can't. We're not
allowed.

303
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:25,415
MATT: Well, obviously.

304
00:15:25,415 --> 00:15:26,345
(all laugh)

305
00:15:26,345 --> 00:15:27,436
MATT: Well, No Shave 'Til 10k.

306
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:28,143
TRAVIS: That's true!

307
00:15:28,143 --> 00:15:30,848
MATT: And my Halloween costume requires a decent
amount of facial hair.

308
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:31,706
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right.

309
00:15:31,706 --> 00:15:35,592
TRAVIS: A sexy amount of facial hair, you beast!
Be glad there's a table between you and I.

310
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:37,615
(all laugh)

311
00:15:37,615 --> 00:15:40,300
LIAM: I was a little worried about some
performance capture coming up,

312
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,097
but it got moved back--

313
00:15:42,097 --> 00:15:43,137
LAURA: So you can shave--

314
00:15:43,137 --> 00:15:44,220
LIAM: Off to the races.

315
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:44,996
MATT: Yeah!

316
00:15:44,996 --> 00:15:47,873
LAURA: How far are we from 10K?

317
00:15:47,873 --> 00:15:48,612
TRAVIS: I gotta shave tonight.

318
00:15:48,612 --> 00:15:50,091
CREW: 509.

319
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:51,047
MATT: 509 away.

320
00:15:51,047 --> 00:15:51,983
LAURA: All right.

321
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:52,756
SAM: So, like, tomorrow.

322
00:15:52,756 --> 00:15:53,589
MARISHA: Yeah, no.

323
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:54,415
MATT: We'll see.

324
00:15:54,415 --> 00:15:55,292
MARISHA: Tonight.

325
00:15:55,292 --> 00:16:03,221
MATT: All right, so, everyone. As this huge,
blue-scaled reptilian-like creature with multiple

326
00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:09,453
arms and legs comes skittering down the side of
the cliffs, blocking off the entirety of this

327
00:16:09,453 --> 00:16:15,602
passage, snarling at you with sharp teeth and this
sparking-blue electrical energy jutting out of the

328
00:16:15,602 --> 00:16:18,726
corners of its mouth. I want you all to roll
initiative.

329
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,723
MARISHA: So soon! Which one?

330
00:16:23,723 --> 00:16:26,251
SAM: I add 20 to this, right, that's how it
works?

331
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:30,161
MARISHA: Not good.

332
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:32,184
LAURA: Oh no!

333
00:16:32,184 --> 00:16:33,151
SAM: See you guys in--

334
00:16:33,151 --> 00:16:34,282
MARISHA: Always cocked!

335
00:16:34,282 --> 00:16:35,290
TRAVIS: I didn't level up! What a dick.

336
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,201
MARISHA: Still not great.

337
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:37,653
LIAM: Wait, you did but you didn't, is what you're
saying?

338
00:16:37,653 --> 00:16:38,744
TRAVIS: I did, but I didn't.

339
00:16:38,744 --> 00:16:39,762
LIAM: Add some hit points!

340
00:16:39,762 --> 00:16:40,865
LAURA: Yeah, add your points right now.

341
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:41,712
LIAM: Add some hit points!

342
00:16:41,712 --> 00:16:42,602
TRAVIS: How many do I add?

343
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:43,169
MARISHA: It's like--

344
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,555
MATT: 1d12 plus your constitution modifier!

345
00:16:44,555 --> 00:16:45,606
LAURA: 1d12!

346
00:16:45,606 --> 00:16:46,803
MARISHA: Barbarian, man!

347
00:16:46,803 --> 00:16:47,971
LIAM: Hey, we play D&amp;D!

348
00:16:47,971 --> 00:16:48,965
LAURA: Hey, that's good! Plus--

349
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:49,754
LIAM: Plus--

350
00:16:49,754 --> 00:16:51,450
LAURA: Whoa! 16 extra health points!

351
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,014
MATT: Whoa, what'd you roll?!

352
00:16:53,014 --> 00:16:54,276
LAURA: He rolled an 11 plus five!

353
00:16:54,276 --> 00:16:55,511
LIAM: Dang!

354
00:16:55,511 --> 00:16:56,524
MARISHA: That's hot.

355
00:16:56,524 --> 00:16:58,752
MATT: That's pretty hot. So many hit points for
the barbarian.

356
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:01,373
LIAM: And, if you want, you can just boost to, are
you at 12 now?

357
00:17:01,373 --> 00:17:02,950
TRAVIS: What?

358
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,564
LIAM: Level 12? Are you at level 12?

359
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:07,401
LAURA: Don't complicate things.

360
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,123
LIAM: Just smash, smash, Hulk smash.

361
00:17:09,123 --> 00:17:11,860
SAM: How many spells does he get?

362
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:16,246
MATT: All of them. All right, so initiatives we
have-- 25 to 20, anyone?

363
00:17:16,246 --> 00:17:19,171
TALIESIN: 21.

364
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:26,462
MATT: All right. 20 to 15?

365
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,231
LAURA: 19.

366
00:17:28,231 --> 00:17:30,142
TRAVIS: Me too. 16.

367
00:17:30,142 --> 00:17:34,082
MATT: 16? 15 to ten?

368
00:17:34,082 --> 00:17:35,952
MARISHA: Ten.

369
00:17:35,952 --> 00:17:39,614
MATT: Ten, Keyleth. Ten to five?

370
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:44,374
LIAM: Eight! I consistently botch this roll.

371
00:17:44,374 --> 00:17:48,462
SAM: See you guys in like an hour. I got a four.

372
00:17:48,462 --> 00:17:51,562
MATT: Scanlan, you have consistently the best
initiative rolls.

373
00:17:51,562 --> 00:17:53,914
SAM: Oh, yeah. I save it for when it counts.

374
00:17:53,914 --> 00:17:58,542
MATT: As you should, as you should. So, first up:
Percy. Instinctively, with your drive towards

375
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:02,514
Whitestone and this creature in your way, you are
already ready for this encounter. What are you

376
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,153
going to do?

377
00:18:04,153 --> 00:18:09,562
TALIESIN: It's bigger than sin, isn't it?

378
00:18:09,562 --> 00:18:11,855
MATT: It is considered a huge creature.

379
00:18:11,855 --> 00:18:21,322
TALIESIN: Okay, so, I'm going to alert everybody,
get down! And I'm going to take three shots--

380
00:18:21,322 --> 00:18:23,203
SAM: You're just going to start shooting.

381
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:24,016
TALIESIN: Hmm?

382
00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:25,271
SAM: You're just going to start shooting.

383
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,903
TALIESIN: I'm just going to-- look at that
thing!!

384
00:18:26,903 --> 00:18:28,456
MARISHA: Hey, Percy gonna do what Percy gonna do.

385
00:18:28,456 --> 00:18:29,881
SAM: What if you could reason with him?

386
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:31,565
LAURA: He is definitely--

387
00:18:31,565 --> 00:18:36,899
TALIESIN: Why doesn't it reason with me, is what
I'm asking! It could reason with me!

388
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:39,356
LIAM: There's a lot of heads in the way. Just aim
true.

389
00:18:39,356 --> 00:18:43,214
TALIESIN: I'm aiming, I'm going to use the
Sharpshooter for extra damage.

390
00:18:43,214 --> 00:18:44,133
MATT: All righty.

391
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:45,772
TALIESIN: Three pepperbox shots.

392
00:18:45,772 --> 00:18:48,027
LIAM: I will be less handsome with one ear, I'm
just saying.

393
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:49,169
MATT: With the minus five.

394
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,375
TALIESIN: Yeah, so that's 17.

395
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,057
MATT: 17 hits.

396
00:18:53,057 --> 00:18:55,638
Just go ahead and roll the attacks in
succession.

397
00:18:55,638 --> 00:18:56,516
TALIESIN: Hmm?

398
00:18:56,516 --> 00:18:58,310
MATT: Go ahead and roll the attacks in succession
so we know how many hit.

399
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,500
TALIESIN: Okay.

400
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,798
MATT: Second shot.

401
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:05,700
TALIESIN: Second one, it hits, 18 plus seven.

402
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,810
MATT: It hits. Third one?

403
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:14,471
TALIESIN: For the third one, I'm going to go for a
head shot instead of a Sharpshooter.

404
00:19:14,471 --> 00:19:16,800
MATT: Okay.

405
00:19:17,892 --> 00:19:19,567
TALIESIN: And that's 21.

406
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:21,406
MATT: Okay, all three hit. Go ahead and roll
damage.

407
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:28,947
TRAVIS: The dark cloud aids his rolls.

408
00:19:28,947 --> 00:19:29,919
LAURA: (whispers) Vengeance!

409
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,058
TALIESIN: 17.

410
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:32,206
MATT: 17 damage.

411
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:33,474
LAURA: (whispers) Vengeance!

412
00:19:33,474 --> 00:19:34,667
TALIESIN: Better!

413
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:35,511
TRAVIS: Vengeance!

414
00:19:35,511 --> 00:19:37,104
TALIESIN: 25.

415
00:19:37,104 --> 00:19:38,175
MATT: All righty!

416
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:44,557
TALIESIN: That went really well. The last one-- do
I do any damage when I hit the head? Normal

417
00:19:44,557 --> 00:19:51,264
damage. So, last one is seven points of damage
plus he's got--

418
00:19:51,264 --> 00:19:53,164
MATT: Disadvantage on his attacks this round.

419
00:19:53,164 --> 00:19:54,279
TALIESIN: Yeah, disadvantage on attacks.

420
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:56,221
MATT: Gotcha. Do you want to stay where you are,
or are you going to move?

421
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:59,006
TALIESIN: Am I touching a wall?

422
00:19:59,006 --> 00:20:01,471
MATT: You're right close to one. You can--

423
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:03,166
LAURA: Stop touching me. Stop touching me.

424
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,813
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to brace against a
wall.

425
00:20:04,813 --> 00:20:06,629
MATT: Okay. Brace against that wall, there.
Gotcha.

426
00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:09,069
TALIESIN: And I'm going to mark all this off.

427
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:17,401
MATT: All righty. Okay. Next up is the creature.

428
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:18,671
LAURA: Argh.

429
00:20:18,671 --> 00:20:21,906
MATT: (Laughs) Because it rolled really high on
its initiative. It's going to go ahead. Let's see,

430
00:20:21,906 --> 00:20:23,605
at a movement of 50 feet.

431
00:20:23,605 --> 00:20:24,494
LIAM: Oh god.

432
00:20:24,494 --> 00:20:25,462
LAURA: (gasps)

433
00:20:25,462 --> 00:20:26,463
TRAVIS: (whispers) Are we in a valley? Or are
we--

434
00:20:26,463 --> 00:20:27,813
LAURA: We're in a freaking--

435
00:20:27,813 --> 00:20:28,877
MARISHA: We're in a death trap.

436
00:20:28,877 --> 00:20:29,824
LIAM: It crawled down the wall.

437
00:20:29,824 --> 00:20:31,190
SAM: No, it's going to be fine, guys. We're like
a--

438
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,411
TALIESIN: We're outdoors.

439
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:34,473
SAM: The valley is like a taco shell.

440
00:20:34,473 --> 00:20:36,611
LAURA: Is it a valley, or is it like those are
cliff sides and we could fall?

441
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,089
MATT: It's a valley. The cliff sides go up.

442
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:39,711
SAM: Yeah, it's like a taco shell and we're the
meat.

443
00:20:39,711 --> 00:20:40,429
TRAVIS: Okay.

444
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:41,197
LAURA: Okay.

445
00:20:41,197 --> 00:20:42,014
MARISHA: And we're-- Yeah. Yeah.

446
00:20:42,014 --> 00:20:42,649
(all laugh)

447
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:44,587
MATT: You could climb around it without a problem.
But it's pretty sheer. You'd have to make climb

448
00:20:44,587 --> 00:20:45,793
checks if you want to--

449
00:20:45,793 --> 00:20:46,869
MARISHA: Yep, accurate.

450
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:47,761
LIAM: We're in a tight spot.

451
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:48,603
LAURA: Okay. Got it.

452
00:20:48,603 --> 00:20:49,500
LIAM: We're in a tight spot.

453
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,372
MARISHA: Unless you're in Japan.

454
00:20:50,372 --> 00:20:51,107
MATT: So it scurries forward--

455
00:20:51,107 --> 00:20:51,812
TALIESIN: Taco.

456
00:20:51,812 --> 00:20:53,615
MATT: Lowers its jaw and rears its head back. As
it does, you see its eyes flare with electrical

457
00:20:53,615 --> 00:20:56,919
energy and inside its mouth begins to glow with a
brightish blue, white power.

458
00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:57,836
LIAM: Get down.

459
00:20:57,836 --> 00:21:05,002
MATT: A bolt of electrical energy comes forward,
hitting Grog, Vax, Scanlan, and Percy.

460
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:07,154
TRAVIS: It's electrifying!

461
00:21:07,154 --> 00:21:08,323
LAURA: Electrified.

462
00:21:08,323 --> 00:21:14,407
MATT: Well, let's see. Actually, no, it would move
out to-- Hmm, that's only 20 feet, so to get

463
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:18,837
maximum-- This, let's see.

464
00:21:18,837 --> 00:21:20,054
SAM: Maybe it doesn't do math well.

465
00:21:20,054 --> 00:21:21,143
LAURA: Don't think about it, just go.

466
00:21:21,143 --> 00:21:23,055
SAM: Maybe it doesn't know math well. Maybe it
doesn't move right.

467
00:21:23,055 --> 00:21:24,511
LAURA: Don't calculate it, Matt. It's fine.

468
00:21:24,511 --> 00:21:25,580
MATT: No, actually for optimal--

469
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,454
LAURA: Fuck.

470
00:21:26,454 --> 00:21:27,973
MATT: --optimal impact here, instead, it's going
to go there.

471
00:21:27,973 --> 00:21:29,548
TRAVIS: I have to put my head in its mouth?

472
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:31,422
MATT: (laughs) Practically.

473
00:21:31,422 --> 00:21:32,793
LIAM: (laughs) Eh.

474
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:36,095
MATT: It will then do it on-- It would be Grog,
Vex, and Trinket.

475
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:38,078
SAM: I approve of that.

476
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:46,075
MATT: I realized that its bolt is only 20 feet
long. So, utilizing its optimal Lightning Bolt

477
00:21:46,075 --> 00:21:47,842
length, you guys were clustered together.

478
00:21:47,842 --> 00:21:48,644
TRAVIS: Okay.

479
00:21:48,644 --> 00:21:51,803
MATT: All right, so I need you guys, you three, to
roll a dexterity saving throw.

480
00:21:52,374 --> 00:21:53,720
TALIESIN: With advantage?

481
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,738
LAURA: With advantage because I'm in the
mountains?

482
00:21:55,738 --> 00:21:58,814
MATT: You do it with advantage. It only affects
attacks, not for saving throws.

483
00:21:58,814 --> 00:22:00,293
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right. This is a magic save.

484
00:22:00,293 --> 00:22:02,274
TRAVIS: 19.

485
00:22:02,327 --> 00:22:04,344
MATT: Good to know.

486
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:06,032
TALIESIN: I probably should spend Grit.

487
00:22:06,032 --> 00:22:06,917
LAURA: 21.

488
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:08,292
MATT: All right. And Trinket?

489
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:10,433
LAURA: Argh.

490
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:11,480
LIAM: (Chewbacca sounds)

491
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,331
LAURA: (growls) Eight. Yay.

492
00:22:16,331 --> 00:22:17,538
MATT: He got an eight?

493
00:22:17,538 --> 00:22:18,952
LAURA: He got a eight.

494
00:22:18,952 --> 00:22:22,154
MATT: Oof, okay. 33 points of lightning damage to
both of you.

495
00:22:22,154 --> 00:22:23,493
LAURA: (gasps)

496
00:22:23,493 --> 00:22:24,765
SAM: Wait, that means--

497
00:22:24,765 --> 00:22:25,900
MATT: Trinket takes 66.

498
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,986
SAM: 66?

499
00:22:26,986 --> 00:22:28,322
LAURA: Trinket's fucking dead, yo.

500
00:22:28,322 --> 00:22:29,021
SAM: What?!

501
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:30,307
MATT: Unconscious.

502
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,872
LAURA: That fast?!

503
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:33,915
TRAVIS: Which one: dead or unconscious?

504
00:22:33,915 --> 00:22:34,758
LAURA: He's unconscious.

505
00:22:34,758 --> 00:22:35,831
TALIESIN: Unconscious.

506
00:22:35,831 --> 00:22:38,756
TRAVIS: Don't throw around the "D" word, unless
it's the "D" word time.

507
00:22:38,756 --> 00:22:43,887
MATT: So, as there was a crackling of energy
forward, you two brace yourself, managing to get

508
00:22:43,887 --> 00:22:47,341
mostly out of the way. Unfortunately, both of you
dodging out of the way leaves an open shot for

509
00:22:47,341 --> 00:22:52,756
bear, that just takes the brunt of it, throwing
Trinket up against the side of the actual

510
00:22:52,756 --> 00:22:58,194
mountainous cavern. And slumps to the ground,
smoking off the fur.

511
00:23:00,154 --> 00:23:02,123
LAURA: Does Trinket have to make saving throws?

512
00:23:02,123 --> 00:23:02,966
MATT: Yes.

513
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:04,360
LIAM: Death saving throws? Yes.

514
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,842
MARISHA: No one has any resistance, spell
resistance?

515
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,028
MATT: Not yet. Until we get to his turn. That will
end--

516
00:23:08,028 --> 00:23:09,200
LAURA: Ooh, ooh, wait.

517
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,710
MARISHA: Forgetting-- Your armor? I've got a spell
you're--

518
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,496
LAURA: He's only got 42 hit points.

519
00:23:14,496 --> 00:23:15,550
MATT: Yeah.

520
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,622
SAM: Whoa.

521
00:23:16,622 --> 00:23:19,484
MATT: Technically, he should have more from
leveling up. But, even more wouldn't be that much

522
00:23:19,484 --> 00:23:25,386
higher, so-- Okay, so that's rough. That ends its
turn. Vex, you're up first.

523
00:23:25,386 --> 00:23:27,688
(all laugh)

524
00:23:27,688 --> 00:23:28,699
TRAVIS: She would like to rage.

525
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:29,708
MARISHA: (as Matt) So that sucks, but--

526
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,788
LAURA: Vengeance! Vengeance.

527
00:23:31,788 --> 00:23:33,983
TALIESIN: Say your soul is forfeit.

528
00:23:33,983 --> 00:23:35,837
LAURA: I'm going to Hunter's Mark him.

529
00:23:35,837 --> 00:23:37,105
MATT: All righty.

530
00:23:37,105 --> 00:23:45,061
LAURA: And then I'm going to-- Why is he closer
now? Sorry, Grog.

531
00:23:45,061 --> 00:23:47,548
I'm going to Hail of Thorns him.

532
00:23:47,548 --> 00:23:48,765
MATT: All righty.

533
00:23:48,765 --> 00:23:51,022
SAM: Grog is always in the way.

534
00:23:51,022 --> 00:23:51,984
LAURA: Yeah, well--

535
00:23:51,984 --> 00:23:54,771
TRAVIS: I do need a good back tickle.

536
00:23:55,532 --> 00:23:56,941
LIAM: (as Grog) Got an itch back there.

537
00:23:56,941 --> 00:23:58,956
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughs)

538
00:23:58,956 --> 00:24:00,479
LAURA: 30.

539
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:01,458
MATT: 30 hits.

540
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:04,306
LAURA: No, wait, that's wrong. No, 30.

541
00:24:04,306 --> 00:24:05,739
MATT: 30 hits.

542
00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:12,282
LAURA: (sighs) I'm so angry right now! Thorn's
d--

543
00:24:12,282 --> 00:24:13,732
TRAVIS: It's not at me for once.

544
00:24:13,805 --> 00:24:17,183
LAURA: Ten. (sighs) 3d10.

545
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,661
TALIESIN: For once, you're not the one doing
damage to the bear.

546
00:24:19,661 --> 00:24:21,922
TRAVIS: That's good.

547
00:24:22,876 --> 00:24:25,924
LAURA: 18 plus two is 20.

548
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:30,126
MARISHA: It's a bonus action, so we can do other
shit if Scanlan and I both do it.

549
00:24:30,126 --> 00:24:30,980
LAURA: What is that?

550
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,765
TRAVIS: 22.

551
00:24:31,765 --> 00:24:32,952
LAURA: 22.

552
00:24:32,952 --> 00:24:34,299
MATT: 22 also hits.

553
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:35,102
LAURA: No, that's the attack.

554
00:24:35,102 --> 00:24:37,235
MATT: That's the damage. Okay, gotcha. And Grog,
also--

555
00:24:37,235 --> 00:24:40,471
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

556
00:24:40,471 --> 00:24:41,776
MATT: Because you're right next to it.

557
00:24:41,776 --> 00:24:45,871
TRAVIS: (posh accent) Would that be considered
piercing, bludgeoning, or slashing damage?

558
00:24:46,273 --> 00:24:48,293
MATT: (posh accent) It doesn't matter, you have
not taken your turn to rage yet.

559
00:24:48,293 --> 00:24:49,564
TRAVIS: (posh accent) Oh fucking shit.

560
00:24:49,564 --> 00:24:51,258
(all laugh)

561
00:24:51,258 --> 00:24:52,516
MATT: That would be full damage upon you, Grog.

562
00:24:52,516 --> 00:24:53,566
TRAVIS: Ow! (laughs)

563
00:24:53,566 --> 00:24:57,856
LAURA: Oh shit, I'm sorry. The other one was 27.

564
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:02,073
MATT: To hit? Okay.

565
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:07,540
LAURA: Awoo. Ten plus--

566
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,489
SAM: Angry d10.

567
00:25:09,489 --> 00:25:12,161
LAURA: Plus 15.

568
00:25:12,161 --> 00:25:14,141
MATT: 15. That's including the Hunter's Mark,
right?

569
00:25:14,141 --> 00:25:14,937
LAURA: Yes.

570
00:25:14,937 --> 00:25:16,208
MATT: All right, good.

571
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:22,317
LAURA: Oh wait, no, I wasn't adding the seven.
Wait no, that's a lie. That's a 15, 16, 17, plus

572
00:25:22,317 --> 00:25:23,756
five. 21.

573
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:29,528
MATT: 21, got it. So, as you look over and you see
Trinket on the ground, smoldering spire of smoke

574
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,843
pouring off of his body--

575
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:32,240
LAURA: Can I pull him? Can I pull him out of the
way?

576
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,168
MARISHA: Smells like burnt fur.

577
00:25:33,168 --> 00:25:34,166
SAM: Burnt fur.

578
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:35,736
LAURA: Just pull him into the little crevice, for
my move.

579
00:25:35,736 --> 00:25:36,914
MATT: This way, do you mean?

580
00:25:36,914 --> 00:25:39,208
LAURA: For my move. Is that a move action, or
would it be an action-action?

581
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:40,738
MATT: That would be more of an action-action,
unfortunately.

582
00:25:40,738 --> 00:25:42,451
LAURA: Ugh. Oh no.

583
00:25:42,451 --> 00:25:48,063
MATT: But you angrily turn around, release your
arrow, firing a completely furious Hail of Thorns

584
00:25:48,063 --> 00:25:53,177
into the creature. As it hits, it shatters across
its hide, some of it scattering onto Grog. You

585
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:56,602
don't even care. You just focus the anger, pull
out a second arrow, unleash this one. Actually

586
00:25:56,602 --> 00:26:00,967
jamming underneath one of the scales. You can see
a little trickle of dark, deep purple blood

587
00:26:00,967 --> 00:26:02,391
beginning to pour from the wound.

588
00:26:02,391 --> 00:26:04,276
LAURA: I get out of the line.

589
00:26:04,276 --> 00:26:05,400
MATT: Okay, where do you want to go?

590
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,728
LAURA: Towards the little crevice.

591
00:26:06,728 --> 00:26:07,438
MATT: Right there?

592
00:26:07,438 --> 00:26:08,127
LAURA: Yeah.

593
00:26:08,127 --> 00:26:09,012
MATT: Okay.

594
00:26:09,012 --> 00:26:09,764
MARISHA: Did we lose--

595
00:26:09,764 --> 00:26:11,104
LAURA: But I still want to be near Trinket.

596
00:26:11,104 --> 00:26:12,541
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn. Grog, you're up.

597
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:15,619
TRAVIS: Getting ass-lit up with the Hail of
Thorns, I go into a rage.

598
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:16,943
LAURA: I'm so sorry.

599
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:17,783
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

600
00:26:17,783 --> 00:26:19,020
TRAVIS: I go into a Frenzied Rage!

601
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,960
MATT: All righty.

602
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,672
TRAVIS: And I would like to attack three times
with my flaming warhammer.

603
00:26:22,672 --> 00:26:23,498
MATT: Certainly.

604
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,857
LIAM: No more shopping today.

605
00:26:24,857 --> 00:26:26,734
TRAVIS: That is 24.

606
00:26:26,734 --> 00:26:28,811
MATT: That hits.

607
00:26:28,811 --> 00:26:29,714
TRAVIS: 21?

608
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:31,395
MATT: That hits.

609
00:26:31,395 --> 00:26:32,673
TRAVIS: Eee! 26.

610
00:26:32,673 --> 00:26:33,770
MATT: That also hits.

611
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:38,038
TRAVIS: Nice. Those were really good rolls. Okay.
First one is 11.

612
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:39,303
LAURA: I think I missed a box.

613
00:26:39,303 --> 00:26:42,890
TRAVIS: 13? First one.

614
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,201
MATT: 13 damage. Good to know.

615
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:45,543
TALIESIN: Brought another sign.

616
00:26:45,543 --> 00:26:47,929
TRAVIS: 14 for the second one.

617
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:49,028
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah.

618
00:26:49,028 --> 00:26:50,061
MATT: Mm-hm.

619
00:26:50,061 --> 00:26:55,331
TRAVIS: Yes. 17 and 18, 19, 20, 21 plus the fire
damage.

620
00:26:55,331 --> 00:26:56,379
MATT: Good to know.

621
00:26:56,379 --> 00:26:57,443
TRAVIS: Including fire damage.

622
00:26:57,443 --> 00:27:02,733
MATT: All right, so, going into the rage, you just
see that same fury. You can smell the burnt hair

623
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:07,360
in the air and you use that to fuel that moment of
pain. You just (impact sounds) and just start

624
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,948
bludgeoning the creature right up in its face. You
can see it's thrashing and snarling at you and

625
00:27:10,948 --> 00:27:18,671
snapping with each blow. You guys are locked in
this titan-versus-human battle right now. Cool,

626
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:20,859
and are you going to stay where you are?

627
00:27:20,859 --> 00:27:23,649
TRAVIS: I'm going to move. Can I move towards you
a little bit?

628
00:27:23,649 --> 00:27:24,474
MATT: This way, there?

629
00:27:24,474 --> 00:27:28,009
TRAVIS: Yes, staying next to him, but just out of
the way of other projectiles that might be coming

630
00:27:28,009 --> 00:27:29,507
up my butthole.

631
00:27:29,507 --> 00:27:33,431
MATT: Fair enough. (laughs) Okay, Grog. Ends your
turn. Keyleth, you're up.

632
00:27:33,431 --> 00:27:38,952
MARISHA: Okay. I'm right next to Trinket, right?

633
00:27:38,952 --> 00:27:40,545
MATT: Mm-hm.

634
00:27:40,545 --> 00:27:42,206
MARISHA: Okay, right? Where is Trinket?

635
00:27:42,206 --> 00:27:43,808
MATT: Trinket's right there. You're over here.

636
00:27:43,808 --> 00:27:45,194
LIAM: Follow the smell.

637
00:27:45,194 --> 00:27:46,743
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and go to Trinket.

638
00:27:46,743 --> 00:27:48,811
LAURA: (laughs)

639
00:27:48,811 --> 00:27:50,103
MATT: Oh, that's right. Make a death saving throw,
by the way.

640
00:27:50,103 --> 00:27:51,224
SAM: Oh, snap.

641
00:27:51,224 --> 00:27:52,042
MATT: Almost forgot.

642
00:27:52,042 --> 00:27:53,085
LAURA: (whimpers) Oh no.

643
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:54,017
MATT: Roll a d20.

644
00:27:54,017 --> 00:27:55,502
LIAM: (sings) Roll high.

645
00:27:55,502 --> 00:27:56,988
MARISHA: He'll be fine. He'll be fine.

646
00:27:56,988 --> 00:27:58,138
TALIESIN: Roll like your bear depends on it.

647
00:27:58,138 --> 00:27:59,440
TRAVIS: You should pick a blood-colored one.

648
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,040
LAURA: Why would you do that? He rolled a 19.

649
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,841
SAM: Ooh.

650
00:28:01,841 --> 00:28:03,924
MATT: Okay, so not creeping closer to death yet.

651
00:28:03,924 --> 00:28:04,970
LAURA: Don't say that.

652
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:09,518
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to go ahead and do a Cure
Wounds spell on him.

653
00:28:09,518 --> 00:28:10,877
MATT: All right.

654
00:28:10,877 --> 00:28:12,291
LAURA: Thank you, Keyleth.

655
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:13,839
MARISHA: I'll just do first level.

656
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:16,117
SAM: Oh. Trinket's not worth second level?

657
00:28:16,117 --> 00:28:18,167
MARISHA: No no no no no. I'll give him a-- shut
up, Scanlan.

658
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:19,154
(all laugh)

659
00:28:19,154 --> 00:28:20,901
LIAM: Wake him up, wake him up, wake him up.

660
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:22,738
MARISHA: I instantly felt guilty, dick.

661
00:28:22,738 --> 00:28:24,101
TALIESIN: You guilted her up to another level.

662
00:28:24,101 --> 00:28:25,547
MARISHA: Yeah, you did. Okay.

663
00:28:25,547 --> 00:28:29,374
TRAVIS: (laughs) That was the best.

664
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,518
SAM: I would've done a cantrip.

665
00:28:30,518 --> 00:28:32,055
MARISHA: (laughs) That's 2d8 plus ten.

666
00:28:32,055 --> 00:28:32,995
TRAVIS: Dick.

667
00:28:32,995 --> 00:28:34,107
LAURA: 2d8 plus ten? That's great.

668
00:28:34,107 --> 00:28:35,408
(all laugh)

669
00:28:35,408 --> 00:28:36,785
TRAVIS: Guilted it for an imaginary bear.

670
00:28:36,785 --> 00:28:37,583
MARISHA: All right, that's pretty good.

671
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:38,445
TALIESIN: That's not bad.

672
00:28:38,445 --> 00:28:41,292
MARISHA: That's an eight and a seven plus ten.
So--

673
00:28:41,292 --> 00:28:42,132
MATT and SAM: 25.

674
00:28:42,132 --> 00:28:42,858
MARISHA: 25.

675
00:28:42,858 --> 00:28:43,432
LAURA: 25!

676
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:44,525
MATT: So Trinket's at 25 hit points, conscious.

677
00:28:44,525 --> 00:28:45,371
LAURA: That's great!

678
00:28:45,371 --> 00:28:47,453
MATT: Prone, but conscious.

679
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:48,696
LAURA: He licks her.

680
00:28:48,696 --> 00:28:50,405
MATT: You hear the-- okay. (laughs)

681
00:28:50,405 --> 00:28:51,973
MARISHA: And then, as a bonus action--

682
00:28:51,973 --> 00:28:52,883
TALIESIN: Ack.

683
00:28:52,883 --> 00:28:53,698
MATT: Mm-hm?

684
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:58,601
MARISHA: Can I, looking at whatever the shit this
is, pull out my spark stone--

685
00:28:58,601 --> 00:28:59,706
LAURA: (gasps)

686
00:28:59,706 --> 00:29:01,365
MARISHA: --that I got from my Fire Ashari.

687
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,600
SAM: That's a thing? Oooh.

688
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,670
MATT: Uh-huh.

689
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,743
MARISHA: And (shattering sound).

690
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,517
SAM: (gasps)

691
00:29:05,517 --> 00:29:07,133
TALIESIN: Oh, wow! We're going there.

692
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:07,910
MATT: Okay.

693
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,821
SAM: Is that, like, "Break glass in case of
emergency"?

694
00:29:09,821 --> 00:29:11,306
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't know what it does.

695
00:29:11,306 --> 00:29:12,264
SAM: (laughs) Oh, great!

696
00:29:12,264 --> 00:29:13,006
TRAVIS: We'll find out.

697
00:29:13,006 --> 00:29:14,436
SAM: Hope I'm right next to you.

698
00:29:14,436 --> 00:29:16,183
MATT: After you finish healing Trinket--

699
00:29:16,183 --> 00:29:16,975
LAURA: Oh my god.

700
00:29:16,975 --> 00:29:19,572
MATT: -- you pull up, reach out, and pull this.
And you're going to hold it in your hands, you

701
00:29:19,572 --> 00:29:23,315
could feel it's warm to the touch. Almost too hot
to hold. And there's this slight pulsing, almost

702
00:29:23,315 --> 00:29:28,081
like a heartbeat pulse to it. You hold it in your
hands and just crush it, concentrating all your

703
00:29:28,081 --> 00:29:31,612
energy on it. As you do, what seemed to be hard
and sturdy all of a sudden turns brittle in your

704
00:29:31,612 --> 00:29:36,992
fingers, and it cracks and breaks, almost like it
was made of a very, very brittle earth. As it

705
00:29:36,992 --> 00:29:42,385
breaks and your hands come together, the "too hot
to touch" becomes too hot to touch, and for a

706
00:29:42,385 --> 00:29:44,115
moment, your hands burst into flames--

707
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:44,917
SAM: Ah.

708
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:47,498
MATT: And you instinctively pull back like you
want to go ahead and put out the fire--

709
00:29:47,498 --> 00:29:48,853
MARISHA: Ow!

710
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:52,518
MATT: -- but then it falls to a normal temperature
again, but the flames remain.

711
00:29:52,518 --> 00:29:53,468
LAURA: (gasps)

712
00:29:53,468 --> 00:29:56,406
MATT: And you can now see your hands are now
emitting flame from all the fingers.

713
00:29:56,406 --> 00:29:57,070
SAM: Woo.

714
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:57,834
LAURA: Is that permanent?

715
00:29:57,834 --> 00:29:59,160
SAM: What does it do?

716
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,361
MARISHA: We'll find out. And I go Minxie.

717
00:30:01,361 --> 00:30:02,504
MATT: All right.

718
00:30:02,504 --> 00:30:03,487
TRAVIS: Yeah, Minxie!

719
00:30:03,487 --> 00:30:04,847
(all cheer)

720
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:05,832
MARISHA: And I brought the hood.

721
00:30:05,832 --> 00:30:09,220
(all laugh)

722
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,281
SAM: Too hot to handle, too cold to hold.

723
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:13,467
LIAM: That tiger's on fire!

724
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:14,644
TRAVIS: They in control.

725
00:30:14,644 --> 00:30:16,472
MATT: Keyleth transforms into Minxie! And as
Minxie--

726
00:30:16,472 --> 00:30:17,528
TRAVIS: Bobby Brown.

727
00:30:17,528 --> 00:30:22,988
MATT: -- appears, her form transitioning into this
large, albino sabre-toothed tiger--

728
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,232
SAM and TALIESIN: (sing) Well, I guess we're gonna
have to take control.

729
00:30:25,232 --> 00:30:28,397
MATT: You can see both of the tiger's claws
embedded into the ground of this rocky terrain are

730
00:30:28,397 --> 00:30:33,085
having licks of fire and flame curling off of the
actual claws.

731
00:30:33,085 --> 00:30:35,331
MARISHA: Hell, yeah. I look like an Ed Hardy
tattoo.

732
00:30:35,331 --> 00:30:37,657
(all laugh)

733
00:30:37,657 --> 00:30:39,784
MATT: (laughs) I regret everything!

734
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:43,325
(all laugh)

735
00:30:43,325 --> 00:30:47,386
MATT: All right. That's your turn. Are you going
to move, are you going to stay there?

736
00:30:47,386 --> 00:30:48,938
MARISHA: Well, I moved to Trinket.

737
00:30:48,938 --> 00:30:51,271
MATT: Right, but you can break your movement up.

738
00:30:51,271 --> 00:30:52,333
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

739
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:55,077
MATT: You've moved 20 feet, so you still have ten
more feet to move if you want to.

740
00:30:55,077 --> 00:30:59,326
MARISHA: I'll start heading to try and flank him.
To flank the blue beastie.

741
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:07,237
MATT: That should be there. Okay. All right, that
ends Keyleth. Now would be Tiberius. Tiberius, who

742
00:31:07,237 --> 00:31:16,256
now takes the turn to cast Stoneskin on himself.
Then backs up behind this side, there, preparing

743
00:31:16,256 --> 00:31:19,514
for the next round. Vax, you're up.

744
00:31:19,514 --> 00:31:24,735
LIAM: Okay, Vax drops low. I click the boots of
haste together, and for everyone who keeps asking,

745
00:31:24,735 --> 00:31:28,967
if I click my boots of haste together, I then get
to attack three times. I get that question about

746
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:33,392
three times a week. So that's how I do it. So, I
click the boots of haste together, and then I'm

747
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:43,572
going to crouch low and scoot. No, the other side
of Minxie, and I should be able to go 60 feet

748
00:31:43,572 --> 00:31:47,636
without a problem all the way past the fucker.

749
00:31:47,636 --> 00:31:48,579
MATT: Mm-hm?

750
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:51,367
LIAM: Yeah, keep going, as far as I can. That's as
far as I can go?

751
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,373
MATT: Yep.

752
00:31:52,373 --> 00:31:59,421
LIAM: All right. And I guess I will just dagger
him in the ass, then.

753
00:31:59,421 --> 00:32:00,308
MATT: All right.

754
00:32:00,308 --> 00:32:05,364
LIAM: So-- First is a--

755
00:32:05,364 --> 00:32:07,249
TALIESIN: I love that die.

756
00:32:07,249 --> 00:32:09,275
LIAM: Two, three, 24?

757
00:32:09,275 --> 00:32:10,108
MATT: 24 hits.

758
00:32:10,108 --> 00:32:12,079
LIAM: Yes. And this would be Sneak Attack--

759
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:13,226
MATT: This is with Sneak Attack, yep.

760
00:32:13,226 --> 00:32:14,248
LIAM: Because he's with Grog.

761
00:32:14,248 --> 00:32:15,006
MATT: Yep.

762
00:32:15,006 --> 00:32:15,861
LAURA: Yeah!

763
00:32:15,861 --> 00:32:23,631
LIAM: So, here's the damage for the attack. Ooh.
Two, seven, is nine, plus-- Ooh.

764
00:32:23,631 --> 00:32:25,320
LAURA: Ooh, oh no.

765
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,940
LIAM: This is 13, 17, 19, 20, 26, 31 for the
first.

766
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,972
TRAVIS: Jesus.

767
00:32:31,972 --> 00:32:40,072
LIAM: Second attack go. Oh, that's not the right
die at all. Second attack goes. Same. Eee, 23?

768
00:32:40,072 --> 00:32:41,751
MATT: All right, that hits.

769
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,469
LIAM: Okay. And this is--

770
00:32:43,469 --> 00:32:44,798
MATT: Regular damage now.

771
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:47,018
LIAM: Yeah yeah yeah. That's seven?

772
00:32:47,018 --> 00:32:48,223
MATT: Seven, all righty.

773
00:32:48,223 --> 00:32:52,090
LIAM: And then the last dagger, the keen dagger,
stabs him in the butt again, and that is--

774
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:53,157
LAURA: Ow.

775
00:32:53,157 --> 00:32:54,455
LIAM: Ow, 16.

776
00:32:54,455 --> 00:32:56,375
MATT: 16. That does not hit.

777
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:57,430
LIAM: Whiff!

778
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:00,964
MATT: You actually go with a third one. The first
one stabs through, and you can see you've actually

779
00:33:00,964 --> 00:33:06,049
hit some sort of an internal organ as you pull
back and starts gouting blood. You see that, you

780
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:09,657
stab a second blade in the same area and tend to
open the wound another inch, inch and a half. The

781
00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:14,644
third one, you pull back, but it slinks around
over its shoulder, its long sinewy neck curling

782
00:33:14,644 --> 00:33:18,759
over and staring at you. And your blade catches
the hide instead and streaks off of the scales.

783
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:20,260
LIAM: Oh, hi.

784
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,866
MATT: That'll end your turn. Scanlan, you're up.

785
00:33:22,866 --> 00:33:24,524
SAM: Do I have to heal Trinket anymore?

786
00:33:24,524 --> 00:33:25,956
LAURA: No, he's okay.

787
00:33:25,956 --> 00:33:35,675
SAM: Okay. Then I will-- (laughs) Let's see here.
Do we want to get him away from us, or do we want

788
00:33:35,675 --> 00:33:37,697
to hurt him? Let's do--

789
00:33:37,697 --> 00:33:39,142
LAURA: We want to hurt him!

790
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,881
SAM: Well, I don't hurt things very well.
(laughs)

791
00:33:41,881 --> 00:33:42,888
TRAVIS: Do what you're going to do.

792
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:43,790
LAURA: Do what you do.

793
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,909
TALIESIN: You hurt feelings.

794
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:46,355
MARISHA: You do you, Scanlan.

795
00:33:46,355 --> 00:33:51,031
SAM: Okay. I'll do some Bigby Hand.

796
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:52,262
MATT: All righty.

797
00:33:52,262 --> 00:33:56,075
SAM: I summon Bigby's Hand. (sings) Bigby's Hand!

798
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,695
(all laugh)

799
00:33:57,695 --> 00:34:02,454
MATT: This giant spectral hand, sparkling arcane
energy appears roughly in front of your space.

800
00:34:02,454 --> 00:34:05,164
SAM: It's in front of me. I can't make it go in
front of him?

801
00:34:05,164 --> 00:34:05,835
MATT: You can.

802
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:06,548
SAM: Okay.

803
00:34:06,548 --> 00:34:08,251
MATT: Like, I'm just saying, from a flavor
standpoint.

804
00:34:08,251 --> 00:34:12,269
SAM: Okay. Well then, I do one of these, the Sugar
Ray Leonard. I do this--

805
00:34:12,269 --> 00:34:13,639
(all laugh)

806
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,309
SAM: And then I throw my other hand forward.

807
00:34:15,309 --> 00:34:16,675
(all laugh)

808
00:34:16,675 --> 00:34:19,276
SAM: And I'll just punch him in the face.

809
00:34:19,276 --> 00:34:20,060
MATT: Go for it.

810
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,099
(all laugh)

811
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:22,000
MATT: I like that.

812
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,752
SAM: Right? Because I can do the-- It says huge or
smaller creature, at least with Grasping Hand. Is

813
00:34:26,752 --> 00:34:28,231
that only-- does that count?

814
00:34:28,231 --> 00:34:32,512
MATT: Right. Oh. You can just punch something with
it, no matter its size, to do damage.

815
00:34:32,512 --> 00:34:34,624
SAM: So the Clenched Fisht, Clenched Fist.

816
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,658
MATT: Correct. Correct.

817
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:36,567
LAURA: Clenched Fisht.

818
00:34:36,567 --> 00:34:37,470
MATT: Clenched Fisht.

819
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,452
SAM: Clenched Fisht attack, Money Penny.

820
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,495
MATT: Thish ish the one you're talking about. Yes.
All right, so--

821
00:34:41,444 --> 00:34:46,184
For the Clenched Fist, make a melee spell
attack. So roll a d20 and add your spell attack

822
00:34:46,237 --> 00:34:47,614
modifier.

823
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,186
SAM: (laughs) Nope.

824
00:34:51,186 --> 00:34:52,334
(all laugh)

825
00:34:52,334 --> 00:34:53,457
LAURA: Oh no.

826
00:34:53,457 --> 00:34:54,448
SAM: 13.

827
00:34:54,448 --> 00:35:00,134
MATT: 13. As the fist swings out, it ducks out of
the way. Its serpentine body ducking as the fist

828
00:35:00,134 --> 00:35:02,870
arcs off into the middle of the air.

829
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:03,661
MARISHA: Oh.

830
00:35:03,661 --> 00:35:05,387
MATT: Spinning around, preparing itself for a
secondary round, hopefully.

831
00:35:05,387 --> 00:35:06,734
LAURA: Good try, Scanlan.

832
00:35:06,734 --> 00:35:07,977
SAM: Oh boy. (laughs)

833
00:35:07,977 --> 00:35:08,872
MATT: That's good.

834
00:35:08,872 --> 00:35:10,842
LIAM: Vax sees it fly over his head, and watches
it pass.

835
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,770
(all laugh)

836
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:18,399
SAM: I'll take a step to my left, so I'm not in
the same line of fire as Percy.

837
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:19,612
MATT: All right.

838
00:35:19,612 --> 00:35:27,831
SAM: And I'll also inspire Grog. (sings) He's
Grog, he's Grog, he's big, he's strong, like wood.

839
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:29,824
He's better than bad, he's good.

840
00:35:29,824 --> 00:35:33,415
(all laugh)

841
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:34,394
LAURA: That's awesome.

842
00:35:34,394 --> 00:35:35,892
MATT: (sings) Everyone wants a Grog.

843
00:35:35,892 --> 00:35:37,126
TRAVIS: That's amazing. Is that a ten? That's a
ten?

844
00:35:37,126 --> 00:35:37,964
MATT: d10, yeah.

845
00:35:37,964 --> 00:35:38,583
TRAVIS: Amazing.

846
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:40,126
MATT: d10 Inspiration die from the bard.

847
00:35:40,126 --> 00:35:41,121
TRAVIS: Thank you, Scanlan.

848
00:35:41,121 --> 00:35:43,126
MATT: Top of the round again. Percy, you're up.

849
00:35:43,126 --> 00:35:50,931
TALIESIN: I'm going to scoot a little bit forward,
just into that little crevice. I'm going to take

850
00:35:50,931 --> 00:35:54,392
three more shots, just to see what I can do.

851
00:35:54,392 --> 00:35:57,024
MATT: Okay. You have the Sharpshooter feat,
right?

852
00:35:57,024 --> 00:35:58,401
TALIESIN: With the Sharpshooter feat.

853
00:35:58,401 --> 00:36:00,730
MATT: Okay, so yeah. Because it would have partial
cover right now, but you ignore that with the--

854
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,250
TALIESIN: I have Sharpshooter, so I can ignore
cover.

855
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,656
MATT: Good to know.

856
00:36:03,656 --> 00:36:09,496
TALIESIN: Yeah, so. But I'm going to be taking a
negative for these hits. Still three attacks per--

857
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,982
MATT: Yeah.

858
00:36:10,982 --> 00:36:12,777
TALIESIN: Okay. Just making sure I'm doing this
right.

859
00:36:12,777 --> 00:36:14,184
MATT: But you have to reload after this turn.

860
00:36:14,184 --> 00:36:16,586
TALIESIN: Yeah.

861
00:36:19,701 --> 00:36:20,712
MATT: Oh no.

862
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,974
TRAVIS: Misfire?

863
00:36:21,974 --> 00:36:22,792
TALIESIN: Misfire.

864
00:36:22,792 --> 00:36:23,463
(all groan)

865
00:36:23,463 --> 00:36:25,666
MATT: First shot. As you pull up to the side, you
pull your pepperbox out and go to fire. As you do,

866
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:31,121
you pull the trigger and the actual barrel sticks
out the side. Spins off, and

867
00:36:31,121 --> 00:36:32,874
(ping-ping-ping) on the ground.

868
00:36:32,874 --> 00:36:34,587
TRAVIS: Fuck.

869
00:36:35,046 --> 00:36:37,804
MATT: So that's your attack.

870
00:36:38,664 --> 00:36:39,737
MARISHA: Balls.

871
00:36:40,029 --> 00:36:41,769
MATT: That's your turn because it'll take you the
rest of the turn to collect the Bad News.

872
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:43,361
SAM: Just say, "Your soul is forfeit," just for
coolness.

873
00:36:43,361 --> 00:36:45,529
(all laugh)

874
00:36:45,529 --> 00:36:47,735
TALIESIN: This normally doesn't happen to me. I
don't quite know what--

875
00:36:47,735 --> 00:36:49,109
(all laugh)

876
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:50,714
TRAVIS: It happens to all guys sometimes.

877
00:36:50,714 --> 00:36:52,367
(all laugh)

878
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:55,301
TALIESIN: So can I, at least, use my bonus to pick
up the pieces and--

879
00:36:55,301 --> 00:36:56,151
MATT: Yeah.

880
00:36:56,151 --> 00:36:57,064
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to pick up the pieces
and--

881
00:36:57,064 --> 00:36:59,252
MATT: You collect Pepperbox and you pull your back
up to it and mutter curses.

882
00:36:59,252 --> 00:37:00,036
LAURA: Oh no.

883
00:37:00,036 --> 00:37:01,138
LIAM: Make sure you grab your dignity as well.

884
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:04,127
TALIESIN: I'm just going to leave that as an open
target for a little while.

885
00:37:04,127 --> 00:37:07,858
MATT: Fair enough. Okay. Now, on its turn--

886
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:08,662
SAM: Oh shit.

887
00:37:08,662 --> 00:37:09,560
LAURA: Oh no.

888
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,681
MATT: First off, let's see here.

889
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:12,709
LIAM: Damn it, attack attack!

890
00:37:12,709 --> 00:37:14,266
SAM: We did great. (laughs)

891
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:19,689
MATT: But that does not recharge its Lightning
Breath. It's going to move here. It's going to go

892
00:37:19,689 --> 00:37:27,123
ahead and make two attacks. It's going to turn
around and its head that's looking at you, now,

893
00:37:27,123 --> 00:37:28,225
after you stabbed it in the back.

894
00:37:28,225 --> 00:37:29,050
LIAM: Yeah.

895
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:33,209
MATT: Reaches down, its giant jaws open. You can
see, like, this thick saliva that's coating its

896
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:37,324
fangs, and it, with serpentine speed, bites at
you.

897
00:37:37,324 --> 00:37:39,369
LIAM: Hey, rogue's Evasion.

898
00:37:39,369 --> 00:37:43,411
MATT: That's going to be a 23 to hit.

899
00:37:43,411 --> 00:37:48,091
LIAM: So, Uncanny Dodge, I can dodge for half
damage, so it was a what to hit?

900
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:48,924
MATT: 23.

901
00:37:48,924 --> 00:37:50,495
LIAM: 23 hits, but I take half damage.

902
00:37:50,495 --> 00:37:51,364
MATT: All right.

903
00:37:51,364 --> 00:37:52,393
LAURA: (as Vax) Half damage.

904
00:37:52,393 --> 00:37:53,699
MATT: So, let's see. That would be--

905
00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:54,748
LIAM: Yesh.

906
00:37:54,748 --> 00:37:55,624
MARISHA: Does a bite attack--

907
00:37:55,624 --> 00:37:58,746
LIAM: Half. Not whole.

908
00:37:58,746 --> 00:38:00,217
LAURA: (as Vax) Half damage.

909
00:38:00,217 --> 00:38:02,190
LIAM: 152 hit points.

910
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,389
TRAVIS: Stop rolling, Jesus.

911
00:38:03,389 --> 00:38:07,400
MATT: (laughs) It would be 26 damage, so you take
13.

912
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,616
LIAM: Ah, nothing.

913
00:38:08,616 --> 00:38:09,506
LAURA: Okay, okay.

914
00:38:09,506 --> 00:38:10,415
TALIESIN: Ain't nothing.

915
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:11,264
LAURA: Don't say that's nothing.

916
00:38:11,264 --> 00:38:12,484
MATT: Points of piercing damage.

917
00:38:12,484 --> 00:38:13,396
LAURA: Don't say that's nothing.

918
00:38:13,396 --> 00:38:18,451
MATT: And then, as it bites, it turns around and
its tail begins to snake around your body, Grog.

919
00:38:18,451 --> 00:38:19,298
LAURA: (gasps)

920
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:21,818
MATT: And its whole body begins to try to reach
around to constrict and crush you.

921
00:38:21,818 --> 00:38:22,651
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

922
00:38:22,651 --> 00:38:23,456
LAURA: What?

923
00:38:23,456 --> 00:38:25,109
MATT: That is a 21 to hit.

924
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:26,357
TRAVIS: That hits.

925
00:38:26,357 --> 00:38:35,248
MATT: All righty, so. You take 21 points in
bludgeoning damage.

926
00:38:35,248 --> 00:38:36,757
TRAVIS: Halved.

927
00:38:36,757 --> 00:38:46,182
MATT: So that'd be 11 points of bludgeoning damage
plus 21 points of slashing damage.

928
00:38:46,387 --> 00:38:47,136
SAM: Whoa.

929
00:38:47,136 --> 00:38:48,179
TRAVIS: Halved.

930
00:38:48,179 --> 00:38:49,637
MATT: As well. So a total of 22 damage.

931
00:38:49,637 --> 00:38:51,125
TRAVIS: Okay.

932
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:54,417
MATT: And you are considered grappled and
restrained, currently, as the entire creature

933
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:58,083
begins to wrap around you. And you're currently
(sound of struggle). You're trying to hold onto

934
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:01,319
your axe but your whole body's being crushed by
this large serpentine creature.

935
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:02,616
(all laugh)

936
00:39:02,616 --> 00:39:04,174
TRAVIS: You piece of shit.

937
00:39:04,174 --> 00:39:08,378
MATT: You feel every pulse of its muscles tensing.
As the pain and ache, you can feel muscles and

938
00:39:08,378 --> 00:39:11,604
ligaments tearing and popping as it pulls in on
you.

939
00:39:11,604 --> 00:39:12,576
TRAVIS: Not cool.

940
00:39:12,576 --> 00:39:25,708
MATT: And it's going to, as part of its grapple,
move you with it to there. And it'll end its turn.

941
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,320
Vex, you're up.

942
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:32,754
LAURA: Okay. How does the Hide thing work? Do I
hide at the beginning of the turn or

943
00:39:32,754 --> 00:39:34,167
at the end of the turn?

944
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:35,148
MATT: At the end of the turn.

945
00:39:35,148 --> 00:39:36,632
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to move out.

946
00:39:36,632 --> 00:39:41,860
MATT: Okay, it has a reach of ten. So you are
technically within its melee range. So you can run

947
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:45,587
but you'll take attack of opportunity from it if
you do. Just so you're aware.

948
00:39:45,587 --> 00:39:47,409
LAURA: Can I still arrow it from where I am?

949
00:39:47,409 --> 00:39:51,078
MATT: You can, but you have disadvantage on all
your ranged attacks because

950
00:39:51,078 --> 00:39:52,342
you are in melee range.

951
00:39:52,342 --> 00:39:54,683
LAURA: Does it cancel out because I'm in the
mountains?

952
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:55,581
MATT: Doesn't affect your attacks.

953
00:39:55,581 --> 00:39:56,384
LAURA: Damn it.

954
00:39:56,384 --> 00:39:59,876
MATT: Sorry. It's up to you, you can stay where
you are and take disadvantage on all your attacks,

955
00:39:59,876 --> 00:40:04,481
or you could run past and it gets a free swipe on
you. Your call.

956
00:40:04,481 --> 00:40:07,343
LAURA: I'm going to try to back up.

957
00:40:07,343 --> 00:40:09,914
MATT: Okay. Over to here? Like, how far?

958
00:40:09,914 --> 00:40:13,862
LAURA: Oh no. Wait, I can't see. I forgot my
glasses.

959
00:40:13,862 --> 00:40:14,969
MATT: Okay, you're right here.

960
00:40:14,969 --> 00:40:15,915
LAURA: Uh-huh.

961
00:40:15,915 --> 00:40:18,187
MATT: You can try and back up this way if you
wanted to get away.

962
00:40:18,187 --> 00:40:20,595
LAURA: Yeah, I'll try to back up towards, who is
that?

963
00:40:20,595 --> 00:40:22,463
MATT: That's Scanlan there. Oh, here?

964
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:23,860
LAURA: Percy? I'll try to back towards Percy.

965
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,553
MATT: Right there?

966
00:40:24,553 --> 00:40:25,280
TALIESIN: Yeah.

967
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:25,812
MATT: Over here?

968
00:40:25,812 --> 00:40:26,940
LAURA: Sure, yeah. Why not?

969
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,731
MATT: Okay, all right.

970
00:40:27,731 --> 00:40:28,526
SAM: What's Trinket doing?

971
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,185
LAURA: Well, Trinket's healed, and he's going to
come with me.

972
00:40:30,185 --> 00:40:33,829
MATT: Okay. So Trinket gets up and used half its
40 movement. It can move--

973
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:36,122
LAURA: Although he's angry about it, because he
wants to fight, but I just won't

974
00:40:36,122 --> 00:40:37,275
let him right now.

975
00:40:37,275 --> 00:40:42,872
MATT: Okay, so as you rush away, the creature
takes-- Ooh, that's a 26 to hit.

976
00:40:42,872 --> 00:40:44,549
LAURA: Aw, Jesus. Really?

977
00:40:44,549 --> 00:40:45,788
SAM: Oh shit, does it hit Trinket, too?

978
00:40:45,788 --> 00:40:46,580
LAURA: No, just me.

979
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,348
MARISHA: 26.

980
00:40:47,348 --> 00:40:48,530
LAURA: Trinket was too far away.

981
00:40:48,530 --> 00:41:01,446
MATT: So you take 18 points of piercing damage.
Oh, it's 3d10, sorry.

982
00:41:01,446 --> 00:41:02,988
LAURA: Oh. (laughs)

983
00:41:02,988 --> 00:41:04,124
MATT: 19. I rolled a one for damage.

984
00:41:04,124 --> 00:41:05,085
LAURA: Oh, yay!

985
00:41:05,085 --> 00:41:08,379
MATT: 19 points of piercing damage as its mouth
lashes out, takes a chunk of your shoulder for a

986
00:41:08,379 --> 00:41:10,829
second, and you wrench yourself away and keep
running.

987
00:41:10,829 --> 00:41:11,649
LAURA: Ugh.

988
00:41:11,649 --> 00:41:13,128
MATT: Take the rest of your turn.

989
00:41:13,128 --> 00:41:16,215
LAURA: Ugh, okay. I'm going to shoot him.

990
00:41:16,215 --> 00:41:17,324
MATT: Yes, you are.

991
00:41:17,324 --> 00:41:22,121
LAURA: Okay. That is 22.

992
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:23,087
MATT: That hits.

993
00:41:23,087 --> 00:41:33,080
LAURA: Okay. 14 for the first hit.

994
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,568
MATT: Okay.

995
00:41:34,568 --> 00:41:37,693
LAURA: Second one is through the blazing bow, at
22.

996
00:41:37,693 --> 00:41:40,851
MATT: Second one hits, first one misses, or did it
hit?

997
00:41:40,851 --> 00:41:42,115
LAURA: Oh no, 14 was the damage to it.

998
00:41:42,115 --> 00:41:44,593
MATT: For damage? All right, second one, blazing
bow?

999
00:41:44,593 --> 00:41:49,634
LAURA: And then, (noises).

1000
00:41:49,634 --> 00:41:50,752
SAM: (noises)

1001
00:41:50,752 --> 00:41:55,746
LAURA: (noises) Ugh. 16.

1002
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:59,596
MATT: 16 damage, all right. Okay.

1003
00:41:59,596 --> 00:42:01,898
LAURA: Oh, and I hide.

1004
00:42:01,898 --> 00:42:05,201
MATT: You currently are completely in its visual
range. You have to be behind something to

1005
00:42:05,201 --> 00:42:06,889
reasonably become hidden.

1006
00:42:06,889 --> 00:42:07,867
LAURA: I'm hiding behind--

1007
00:42:07,867 --> 00:42:09,287
TALIESIN: But you are behind me.

1008
00:42:09,287 --> 00:42:10,178
LAURA: Percy.

1009
00:42:10,178 --> 00:42:12,328
MATT: No, behind a person doesn't work. It has to
be, like, behind a pillar.

1010
00:42:12,328 --> 00:42:13,424
MARISHA: Human shield.

1011
00:42:13,424 --> 00:42:14,495
MATT: Or in deep shadow.

1012
00:42:14,495 --> 00:42:15,460
LAURA: (groans) Oh.

1013
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,765
MATT: Something that would break your line of
sight to it--

1014
00:42:16,765 --> 00:42:17,678
TRAVIS: Like me.

1015
00:42:17,678 --> 00:42:19,630
MATT: For a moment, to the point where it no
longer knows quite where you are.

1016
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,487
MARISHA: It works.

1017
00:42:20,487 --> 00:42:21,333
TALIESIN: It totally works.

1018
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:22,168
LAURA: I hid in the wrong place.

1019
00:42:22,168 --> 00:42:23,079
SAM: Who said that? Who said that?

1020
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:24,110
LAURA: I went to the wrong place.

1021
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:24,973
MATT: But now you know.

1022
00:42:24,973 --> 00:42:26,184
LAURA: It's okay. Next time I know.

1023
00:42:26,184 --> 00:42:26,981
MATT: All right.

1024
00:42:26,981 --> 00:42:27,798
TALIESIN: Putting glass for the dog--

1025
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:29,263
MATT: That's your turn. Grog, you're up.

1026
00:42:29,263 --> 00:42:31,070
TRAVIS: I would like to try and break the
grapple.

1027
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,060
MATT: All right.

1028
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:32,968
TRAVIS: 20.

1029
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:33,972
MATT: 20, yes.

1030
00:42:33,972 --> 00:42:35,317
MARISHA: I can picture that. Why did you do that?

1031
00:42:35,317 --> 00:42:36,410
MATT: Because you are restrained--

1032
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:37,497
TALIESIN: Kicking myself.

1033
00:42:37,497 --> 00:42:50,450
MATT: Need to check what effect the condition--
Here. Just to be safe.

1034
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,812
Okay, yeah. Go ahead and you're making an
athletics check.

1035
00:42:54,115 --> 00:42:55,070
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

1036
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,759
(all cheer)

1037
00:42:56,759 --> 00:42:57,778
TRAVIS: Oh, that was good.

1038
00:42:57,778 --> 00:42:58,444
MATT: All right, so--

1039
00:42:58,444 --> 00:42:59,560
TRAVIS: I bite its tail.

1040
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,262
MARISHA: Yeah.

1041
00:43:00,262 --> 00:43:01,227
(all laugh)

1042
00:43:01,227 --> 00:43:01,992
LAURA: You can.

1043
00:43:01,992 --> 00:43:02,822
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch! Ahhh!

1044
00:43:02,822 --> 00:43:05,506
MATT: As your teeth sink into one of its scales
and you yank it out with the sheer force of your

1045
00:43:05,506 --> 00:43:06,701
muscly neck.

1046
00:43:06,701 --> 00:43:09,233
LAURA: Throw it over my way. I'll catch it.

1047
00:43:09,233 --> 00:43:11,872
MATT: It unfurls for a second, you manage to pull
yourself out of its grasp.

1048
00:43:11,872 --> 00:43:17,395
TRAVIS: I'm so pissed that I broke free, that I
would like to use Intimidating Presence on this

1049
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:18,587
creature.

1050
00:43:18,587 --> 00:43:23,002
MATT: Okay. All right. That is an action to do
that, though, isn't it?

1051
00:43:23,002 --> 00:43:23,964
TRAVIS: Is it?

1052
00:43:23,964 --> 00:43:24,602
MATT: Yeah.

1053
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,566
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1054
00:43:25,566 --> 00:43:27,905
TRAVIS: I reserve Intimidating Presence--

1055
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:28,756
MATT: For a later time.

1056
00:43:28,756 --> 00:43:30,092
TRAVIS: (laughs) -- for a later time.

1057
00:43:30,092 --> 00:43:31,010
MATT: But you have a bonus action, still.

1058
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,035
TRAVIS: I hit the shit out of it.

1059
00:43:32,035 --> 00:43:33,012
(all laugh)

1060
00:43:33,012 --> 00:43:34,234
MATT: You gain another attack, go for it.

1061
00:43:34,234 --> 00:43:35,269
TRAVIS: Okay, 21.

1062
00:43:35,269 --> 00:43:36,294
MATT: 21 does hit.

1063
00:43:36,294 --> 00:43:38,371
TRAVIS: All right, that's 22. 22! Sorry, 22 hits?

1064
00:43:38,371 --> 00:43:39,592
MATT: Also hits. One more.

1065
00:43:39,592 --> 00:43:40,665
TRAVIS: Oh, I get one more.

1066
00:43:40,665 --> 00:43:42,180
LAURA: Ha ha! Also 22.

1067
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:42,969
TRAVIS: Also 22.

1068
00:43:42,969 --> 00:43:43,777
MATT: "Hit" meaning--

1069
00:43:43,777 --> 00:43:44,656
SAM: You hit once.

1070
00:43:44,656 --> 00:43:45,754
MATT: It was one better than your previous--

1071
00:43:45,754 --> 00:43:46,568
TRAVIS: Oh, got you.

1072
00:43:46,568 --> 00:43:47,305
MATT: You hit once, yeah.

1073
00:43:47,305 --> 00:43:47,901
LAURA: Oh.

1074
00:43:47,901 --> 00:43:48,543
TRAVIS and MATT: Just one hit.

1075
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:49,475
SAM: Just keep rolling 22s.

1076
00:43:49,475 --> 00:43:50,238
LAURA: Just keep rolling.

1077
00:43:50,238 --> 00:43:52,102
TRAVIS: Nine, ten, 11, 12. 15.

1078
00:43:52,102 --> 00:43:52,750
MATT: 15 points.

1079
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,195
TRAVIS: With fire damage!

1080
00:43:54,195 --> 00:43:58,444
MATT: All right, so, as you pull away, you reach
back with your hammer and slam it into its side,

1081
00:43:58,444 --> 00:44:00,376
causing this giant burst of fire--

1082
00:44:00,376 --> 00:44:01,197
TRAVIS: Bitch.

1083
00:44:01,197 --> 00:44:04,485
MATT: To emanate from the impact. It shrinks back
for a second and (growls).

1084
00:44:04,485 --> 00:44:06,686
TRAVIS: You grabbed me. You ask first.

1085
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:07,866
TALIESIN: This is a repair die.

1086
00:44:07,866 --> 00:44:09,921
MATT: (laughs) All right, Keyleth, you're up.

1087
00:44:09,921 --> 00:44:11,740
MARISHA: I'm going to do my Bite and Claw
attacks.

1088
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,406
MATT: All right.

1089
00:44:14,377 --> 00:44:18,676
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to move in that crux a
little bit more, one more, if I can?

1090
00:44:18,676 --> 00:44:19,804
MATT: There? All righty.

1091
00:44:19,804 --> 00:44:24,442
MARISHA: Beautiful. I'm going to do my claw
attacks first.

1092
00:44:24,442 --> 00:44:25,333
MATT: Go for it.

1093
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:27,994
MARISHA: To see what they-- what it does.

1094
00:44:30,428 --> 00:44:32,774
MATT: What was it?

1095
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:33,562
MARISHA: It was cocked.

1096
00:44:33,562 --> 00:44:34,806
SAM: It was halfway between two.

1097
00:44:34,806 --> 00:44:35,643
MATT: Okay.

1098
00:44:35,643 --> 00:44:40,956
MARISHA: So that's 12, plus, it's always
different. Okay, 20.

1099
00:44:40,956 --> 00:44:41,901
MATT: 20 hits.

1100
00:44:41,901 --> 00:44:43,220
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1101
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:48,902
MARISHA: I haven't been Minxie in battle for a
while, 1d10 plus five.

1102
00:44:48,902 --> 00:44:50,037
LAURA: Plus your flaming claws.

1103
00:44:50,037 --> 00:44:51,090
TRAVIS: (laughs) I love Minxie.

1104
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,470
LAURA: Don't forget your flaming claws.

1105
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:53,414
LIAM: She's got the plan.

1106
00:44:53,414 --> 00:44:55,288
MARISHA: Yeah, six, so 11 damage for the claws.

1107
00:44:55,463 --> 00:44:57,052
MATT: An additional 1d6 fire damage.

1108
00:44:57,052 --> 00:45:01,956
MARISHA: Plus 1d6, oh wait that's actually-- What
did I just say? I said ten, 11?

1109
00:45:01,956 --> 00:45:03,689
And then an extra 1d6?

1110
00:45:03,689 --> 00:45:05,371
MATT: Yes.

1111
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:07,845
MARISHA: Ooh, another four, so what did I say?

1112
00:45:07,845 --> 00:45:08,568
SAM: 15.

1113
00:45:08,568 --> 00:45:15,475
MATT: So, any of your claw attacks or any claw
attacks you do in any of your forms now get an

1114
00:45:15,653 --> 00:45:17,020
additional 1d6 fire damage.

1115
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,102
SAM: Nice!

1116
00:45:18,102 --> 00:45:19,095
TRAVIS: Hell yeah!

1117
00:45:19,095 --> 00:45:19,927
SAM: Nice!

1118
00:45:19,927 --> 00:45:22,030
MARISHA: Then I'm going to do my bite attack.

1119
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:24,704
MATT: All right, go for it. Your bite does not get
the effect.

1120
00:45:24,704 --> 00:45:25,894
LAURA: I know, it was really loud!

1121
00:45:25,894 --> 00:45:26,936
TRAVIS: It was a good one.

1122
00:45:26,936 --> 00:45:35,177
MARISHA: 16, so plus-- 20, plus my six, plus
seven, so 24.

1123
00:45:35,177 --> 00:45:37,711
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage for the
bite.

1124
00:45:37,711 --> 00:45:40,217
MARISHA: Which is 2d6.

1125
00:45:40,217 --> 00:45:44,984
Eight plus five, so 12.

1126
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:46,798
MATT: Eight plus five is 13.

1127
00:45:46,798 --> 00:45:51,417
MARISHA: 13, 14! Plus, I get an extra damage for
my collar, so 14.

1128
00:45:51,417 --> 00:45:57,473
MATT: Right. Cool. So, your flaming claw strikes
across its outer body, its legs pull away from the

1129
00:45:57,473 --> 00:46:02,028
pain as you reach up and bite into the edge of its
tail. As its tail tries to whip away, you catch

1130
00:46:02,096 --> 00:46:06,337
it and it pulls you forward a few feet as you
clench down on it. Eventually, it yanks its way

1131
00:46:06,337 --> 00:46:09,214
out, taking a couple of scales with it, you can
see a streak where teeth marks are

1132
00:46:09,214 --> 00:46:10,499
on the back of its tail.

1133
00:46:10,499 --> 00:46:11,786
MARISHA: (growls)

1134
00:46:11,786 --> 00:46:13,249
MATT: Awesome. Does that end your turn?

1135
00:46:13,249 --> 00:46:14,110
MARISHA: Yeah.

1136
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:15,198
TRAVIS: Nice, Minxie!

1137
00:46:15,198 --> 00:46:16,676
MARISHA: (growls)

1138
00:46:16,676 --> 00:46:21,339
MATT: Tiberius is going to go around the corner
again and is going to cast Telekinesis and send

1139
00:46:21,339 --> 00:46:22,961
his glaive up spinning.

1140
00:46:22,961 --> 00:46:25,000
LAURA: Glaive?

1141
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,745
SAM: He has a glaive?

1142
00:46:26,745 --> 00:46:28,916
LAURA: The thing that he killed the old lady
with.

1143
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:29,893
SAM: Oh!

1144
00:46:29,893 --> 00:46:30,947
LIAM: It's the granny grinder!

1145
00:46:30,947 --> 00:46:32,630
MARISHA and MATT: Granny grinder?!

1146
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:33,836
TRAVIS: So bad.

1147
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:38,826
MATT: Rolls a two, unfortunately, though. Just
streaks off and spins back around and then, while

1148
00:46:38,826 --> 00:46:43,033
it misses the creature and stops, hovering above
his head with a slow spin. Sits there curling his

1149
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:48,017
fingers, grinning at the creature. And is going to
the use of the rest of this movement to go back

1150
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:52,890
behind the rock because mama didn't raise no fool.
Vax, you're up.

1151
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:59,343
LIAM: It's preoccupied, so I just leisurely walk
backwards about 30 feet, looking at the same wound

1152
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:00,632
that I started before.

1153
00:47:00,632 --> 00:47:01,497
MATT: This way?

1154
00:47:01,497 --> 00:47:06,392
LIAM: No, back up the chasm here. Even further
away. Yeah! And I'm just going to throw three

1155
00:47:06,392 --> 00:47:12,451
daggers into the wound I already hit, so I'm going
to do that again. I know that hits because it hit

1156
00:47:12,451 --> 00:47:14,884
the last time. That's a 23.

1157
00:47:14,884 --> 00:47:15,903
MATT: That hits!

1158
00:47:15,903 --> 00:47:19,293
LIAM: And that's Sneak Attack because he's
occupied. That's 11 plus--

1159
00:47:19,293 --> 00:47:22,324
LAURA: Ooh, those are good!

1160
00:47:22,324 --> 00:47:30,584
LIAM: 11 plus 17, 21, 26, 29, 34, 39 for the first
dagger.

1161
00:47:30,584 --> 00:47:32,327
SAM: What, that's just the first dagger?!

1162
00:47:32,327 --> 00:47:33,059
LAURA: Yeah!

1163
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:33,806
MARISHA: Whoa!

1164
00:47:33,806 --> 00:47:34,863
MATT: Sneak Attack, man.

1165
00:47:34,863 --> 00:47:36,789
LIAM: Next one doesn't hit, probably, that's a
17.

1166
00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:38,324
MATT: 17 just barely hits.

1167
00:47:38,324 --> 00:47:48,953
LIAM: Just barely hits, yeah! That is an eight of
damage. And just wait a second and go-- and throw

1168
00:47:48,953 --> 00:47:53,853
it. And because I was such a cock it misses,
that's a 16.

1169
00:47:53,853 --> 00:48:01,358
MATT: So, oh, perfect! Second dagger wedges in with
the second dagger, opening the wound even more.

1170
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:04,907
You're like, perfect opening! You go for the third
one, and it's grown wise to it, and turns around

1171
00:48:04,907 --> 00:48:08,747
and rakes its claw out and deflects the dagger
midair.

1172
00:48:08,747 --> 00:48:11,447
LIAM: Vex, look at me! Oh, shit.

1173
00:48:11,447 --> 00:48:15,136
LAURA: Nice one! Nice!

1174
00:48:15,136 --> 00:48:18,954
MATT: That brings us to Scanlan.

1175
00:48:18,954 --> 00:48:21,504
SAM: Oh! This is unusual.

1176
00:48:21,504 --> 00:48:25,261
MARISHA: A turn.

1177
00:48:25,261 --> 00:48:33,029
SAM: I still have my Bigby's Hand up, so I do one
of these where I say, oh, a wise guy, see?

1178
00:48:33,029 --> 00:48:38,439
(taunting noises) and I just poke him in the
eyes.

1179
00:48:38,439 --> 00:48:44,181
MATT: All right, as you say "Wise guy, eh?" as
this giant hand's floating in the air, and its

1180
00:48:44,181 --> 00:48:48,079
head snarls at it and tries to bite at the hand.
Go ahead and roll your spell attack.

1181
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:52,490
SAM: 19.

1182
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:56,317
MATT: So, you get to go ahead and--

1183
00:48:56,317 --> 00:48:57,237
SAM: 4d8.

1184
00:48:57,237 --> 00:48:59,931
MATT: Yeah, 4d8 points of force damage.

1185
00:48:59,931 --> 00:49:01,294
MARISHA: It's the eyes!

1186
00:49:01,294 --> 00:49:02,638
LAURA: Into the eyeballs!

1187
00:49:02,638 --> 00:49:06,044
SAM: 19.

1188
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:11,179
MATT: 19 points of force damage as you jam both
its fingers into the sides of its head. Both of

1189
00:49:11,179 --> 00:49:15,439
its eyes recoil on it, it reaches out and starts
thrashing at the air around as the hand dodges

1190
00:49:15,439 --> 00:49:18,209
around for a minute.

1191
00:49:18,209 --> 00:49:29,445
SAM: I hide behind Trinket, the smell of
smoldering fur in my nose. As a bonus action, I

1192
00:49:29,445 --> 00:49:32,809
will-- who's up next, who's coming soon? Is Percy
next?

1193
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:33,863
TALIESIN: I'm up next.

1194
00:49:33,863 --> 00:49:40,652
SAM: I'll inspire Percy. Just doing this move--

1195
00:49:40,652 --> 00:49:41,593
MARISHA: Sexy dance.

1196
00:49:41,593 --> 00:49:46,825
SAM: Going, pour some Scanlan on you! When you
need a hand! That's all I've got.

1197
00:49:46,825 --> 00:49:48,440
TALIESIN: Ugh!

1198
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:53,951
SAM: And I get closer. Pour some Scanlan on you!

1199
00:49:53,951 --> 00:50:00,175
MATT: You begrudgingly take 1d10 inspiration dice
from Scanlan.

1200
00:50:00,175 --> 00:50:02,318
TRAVIS: Is the creature blinded from the
pokey-poke?

1201
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:09,385
MATT: It is not. It is a resilient creature, and
the impact was mainly absorbed by the ocular

1202
00:50:09,385 --> 00:50:11,349
sockets, as opposed to the eyes themselves.

1203
00:50:11,402 --> 00:50:12,862
TRAVIS: Hey, I didn't ask for science. Jesus.

1204
00:50:12,862 --> 00:50:16,508
(all laugh)

1205
00:50:16,508 --> 00:50:20,511
MATT: There's bone around-- never mind. All right.
It ends Scanlan's turn. Percy, you're up.

1206
00:50:20,511 --> 00:50:22,311
TRAVIS: (laughs) Just a little pokey.

1207
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:25,370
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to try and fix this
broken piece of gosa.

1208
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:27,970
SAM: Do I lose another spell for that, or is that
just the same--?

1209
00:50:28,023 --> 00:50:29,543
MATT: No, you can maintain concentration.

1210
00:50:29,543 --> 00:50:31,152
SAM: Okay.

1211
00:50:31,152 --> 00:50:36,095
TALIESIN: I hit a 12, which is just barely enough
to fix it.

1212
00:50:36,095 --> 00:50:39,862
MATT: Okay. So you take your action to go ahead
and repair the gun.

1213
00:50:39,862 --> 00:50:45,887
TALIESIN: And I'm going to burn an Action Surge,
so I'm just-- I finally get it, and it just starts

1214
00:50:45,939 --> 00:50:48,841
going. And I'm just going to empty out the
chamber.

1215
00:50:48,841 --> 00:50:49,856
MATT: All right, three shots.

1216
00:50:49,856 --> 00:50:51,626
MARISHA: (laughs) It just starts going.

1217
00:50:51,626 --> 00:50:52,564
TALIESIN: Ho, nelly.

1218
00:50:52,564 --> 00:50:53,764
MATT: Using your bonus action to reload.

1219
00:50:53,764 --> 00:50:55,313
TRAVIS: I got my finger on the trigger, I got my
finger on the trigger, gun!

1220
00:50:55,313 --> 00:50:57,831
TALIESIN: I don't have to reload, yet, I've got
six shots, so we're still three in the chamber.

1221
00:50:57,831 --> 00:50:59,473
MATT: That's right. We-- yeah, yeah.

1222
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,412
TALIESIN: Unless you, actually--

1223
00:51:00,412 --> 00:51:02,870
MATT: As part of the misfire, you would lose one,
so you have two in the chamber right now.

1224
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:04,151
TALIESIN: I have two in the chamber?

1225
00:51:04,151 --> 00:51:04,958
MATT: Yes.

1226
00:51:04,958 --> 00:51:06,906
TALIESIN: Okay, so I'll do two, and then use the
third one to reload.

1227
00:51:06,906 --> 00:51:08,440
MATT: Okay.

1228
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,631
MARISHA: Pew, pew.

1229
00:51:09,631 --> 00:51:10,588
LAURA: (high-pitched) Pew, pew.

1230
00:51:10,588 --> 00:51:12,236
TALIESIN: All right, so-- Ooh, this'll be fun.

1231
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:13,070
SAM: Don't shoot me.

1232
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,826
TALIESIN: Sharpshooter shot. That's 22.

1233
00:51:16,826 --> 00:51:17,708
MATT: 22 hits.

1234
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:18,906
TRAVIS: Nice.

1235
00:51:18,906 --> 00:51:25,566
TALIESIN: I'll just take the second shot right
now. That's-- really? Really?

1236
00:51:25,566 --> 00:51:27,421
Really, are we going there?

1237
00:51:27,421 --> 00:51:28,839
LAURA: Oh, no.

1238
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:29,974
SAM: Did he misfire again?

1239
00:51:29,974 --> 00:51:30,872
MARISHA: No, you didn't misfire, did you?

1240
00:51:30,872 --> 00:51:31,760
MATT: What'd you roll?

1241
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,630
TALIESIN: Misfired again. I rolled a two.

1242
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:33,498
LAURA: No.

1243
00:51:33,498 --> 00:51:34,433
TALIESIN: I got one shot off.

1244
00:51:34,433 --> 00:51:36,330
MATT: You got one shot off. Go ahead and roll
damage. Sharpshooter damage,

1245
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:37,689
so it gets the plus ten damage.

1246
00:51:37,689 --> 00:51:38,141
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1247
00:51:38,141 --> 00:51:39,690
MARISHA: That's fun.

1248
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:41,802
LAURA: Could you have added inspiration dice to
that?

1249
00:51:41,802 --> 00:51:43,629
TALIESIN: To a misfire? No.

1250
00:51:43,629 --> 00:51:48,378
MATT: No, misfire still hits. There is a lot of
strengths to the gunslinger. This is the one

1251
00:51:48,378 --> 00:51:50,104
penalty, is if you roll bad.

1252
00:51:50,104 --> 00:51:54,112
TALIESIN: So that's, okay, at least this is a
badass, as I at least did some damage. 16, 17, 18,

1253
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:59,304
19, 20, 24 damage, plus four points of fire
damage.

1254
00:51:59,304 --> 00:52:05,393
MATT: Nice. Okay. So, as you go, and you fix it--
It takes the first shot, with a burst of flame

1255
00:52:05,393 --> 00:52:10,344
that shoots out the front of the barrel. The
second shot, this time, the actual metal in the

1256
00:52:10,344 --> 00:52:14,912
front arcs upward, and it looks like this is going
to take a moment, to really seriously repair it.

1257
00:52:14,912 --> 00:52:18,074
Pepperbox is coming through pretty rough in this
fight.

1258
00:52:18,074 --> 00:52:21,349
LAURA: Oh, no. Oh no.

1259
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:22,750
MATT: So that's your turn.

1260
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:24,590
TRAVIS: But not as rough as Stitch over there,
huh?

1261
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:25,411
MATT: Yeah.

1262
00:52:25,411 --> 00:52:26,552
LAURA: We're in a group.

1263
00:52:26,552 --> 00:52:35,428
MATT: Yeah. (laughs) The creature does regain use
of its Lightning Breath.

1264
00:52:35,428 --> 00:52:36,143
LIAM: Right.

1265
00:52:36,143 --> 00:52:37,752
MATT: All right.

1266
00:52:37,752 --> 00:52:40,042
TALIESIN: Oh, I was about to say, and--

1267
00:52:40,042 --> 00:52:41,622
MATT: So you wanna move anywhere?

1268
00:52:41,622 --> 00:52:44,759
TALIESIN: Yeah, I wanna get a little further back.
I wanna roll to the other side of the cave again,

1269
00:52:44,759 --> 00:52:46,130
if possible.

1270
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:47,110
MATT: Which way? You mean over here?

1271
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:49,811
TALIESIN: Yeah. Like, see that little outcropping
of rock?

1272
00:52:49,811 --> 00:52:50,928
MATT: Right here?

1273
00:52:50,928 --> 00:52:55,046
TALIESIN: Further back. Like that over there.

1274
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,357
MARISHA: That little chunky thing?

1275
00:52:56,357 --> 00:52:57,859
MATT: Okay.

1276
00:52:57,859 --> 00:52:59,372
LAURA: Smart move, Percy.

1277
00:52:59,372 --> 00:53:00,470
MATT: All righty.

1278
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:01,847
TALIESIN: That thing scares me.

1279
00:53:01,847 --> 00:53:03,628
LAURA: Why are you abandoning me?

1280
00:53:03,628 --> 00:53:11,736
MATT: Okay. That ends Percy's turn.

1281
00:53:11,736 --> 00:53:14,578
TALIESIN: The beast.

1282
00:53:14,578 --> 00:53:15,822
MARISHA: I don't like the dice that I have.

1283
00:53:15,822 --> 00:53:18,905
TRAVIS: Don't think too hard.

1284
00:53:19,357 --> 00:53:20,240
TALIESIN: That's not good.

1285
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,218
SAM: No.

1286
00:53:21,218 --> 00:53:23,227
LAURA: It just burps out lightning.

1287
00:53:23,682 --> 00:53:26,632
TRAVIS: Jesus, I don't think we've ever seen
anything this hard.

1288
00:53:26,632 --> 00:53:27,431
LAURA: I know.

1289
00:53:27,431 --> 00:53:28,449
LIAM: Guys, guys.

1290
00:53:28,449 --> 00:53:29,190
SAM: What is he doing?

1291
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:30,050
LIAM: Guys.

1292
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:30,854
MARISHA: Have you seen anything like it?

1293
00:53:30,854 --> 00:53:31,607
SAM: What is he doing?

1294
00:53:31,607 --> 00:53:32,249
LIAM: Guys.

1295
00:53:32,249 --> 00:53:32,734
LAURA: He's thinking.

1296
00:53:32,734 --> 00:53:33,449
LIAM: Guys.

1297
00:53:33,449 --> 00:53:33,987
SAM: We broke the DM.

1298
00:53:33,987 --> 00:53:34,522
LAURA: I know.

1299
00:53:34,522 --> 00:53:35,541
TRAVIS: You know the silence before the storm?

1300
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:36,141
MATT: Considering optimal--

1301
00:53:36,141 --> 00:53:36,720
LAURA: This is bad.

1302
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,451
LIAM: He erupts.

1303
00:53:37,451 --> 00:53:38,497
TRAVIS: He hasn't said anything.

1304
00:53:38,497 --> 00:53:39,218
MATT: All right. So.

1305
00:53:39,218 --> 00:53:41,683
(all groan)

1306
00:53:41,683 --> 00:53:43,002
MARISHA: You stared at that for a really long
time.

1307
00:53:43,002 --> 00:53:44,410
SAM: Here comes the other three.

1308
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:46,739
TRAVIS: Here comes the boom?

1309
00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:57,408
MATT: So, this behir is going to shift back here.
You get an attack of opportunity on it, Keyleth.

1310
00:53:57,408 --> 00:54:00,486
So go ahead and take a swing.

1311
00:54:00,486 --> 00:54:01,434
LIAM: Burn it.

1312
00:54:01,434 --> 00:54:02,408
SAM: Fire slap!

1313
00:54:02,408 --> 00:54:03,998
MARISHA: So. 16.

1314
00:54:03,998 --> 00:54:07,551
MATT: 16 just misses. It gets right out of your
grasp. The flames just lick across the outside of

1315
00:54:07,551 --> 00:54:14,826
its scales. As it pulls back, rears down right in
your face, Godzilla-style, just unleashes a burst

1316
00:54:14,826 --> 00:54:15,919
of electrical energy.

1317
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,254
LAURA: Oh, God. Dodge it. Dodge it.

1318
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:20,787
MATT: It hits you and Keyleth. I need you guys to
both make dexterity saving throws.

1319
00:54:20,787 --> 00:54:22,096
SAM: With inspiration.

1320
00:54:22,096 --> 00:54:23,712
MARISHA: Who, me and Grog? Okay.

1321
00:54:23,712 --> 00:54:25,187
SAM: With inspiration.

1322
00:54:25,187 --> 00:54:26,098
TRAVIS: I don't need it.

1323
00:54:26,098 --> 00:54:26,822
SAM: Okay.

1324
00:54:26,822 --> 00:54:29,798
MARISHA: Dexterity saves? That's not good.

1325
00:54:29,798 --> 00:54:32,895
TRAVIS: 19.

1326
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,732
MARISHA: Four.

1327
00:54:34,903 --> 00:54:38,796
MATT: 33 points of lightning damage to you, Grog.
66 to you.

1328
00:54:38,796 --> 00:54:40,706
TRAVIS: Can I use my Stone's Endurance?

1329
00:54:40,706 --> 00:54:41,296
MATT: You can.

1330
00:54:41,296 --> 00:54:42,204
TRAVIS: Okay.

1331
00:54:42,204 --> 00:54:43,519
TALIESIN: What?!

1332
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:44,627
MATT: What's the maximum health of Minxie's form?

1333
00:54:44,627 --> 00:54:46,619
MARISHA: Looking-- I'm out.

1334
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:47,402
MATT: Okay.

1335
00:54:47,402 --> 00:54:48,908
MARISHA: I'm now in Keyleth form.

1336
00:54:48,908 --> 00:54:50,742
MATT: And how much damage goes over?

1337
00:54:50,742 --> 00:54:53,548
MARISHA: Not that many, thank God. 12.

1338
00:54:53,548 --> 00:54:57,682
MATT: 12. Okay, so you-- As Minxie all of a sudden
gets blasted, you can see the form shrink down to

1339
00:54:57,682 --> 00:55:01,353
Keyleth's crumpled form on the ground, hands still
flaming, little bit of singe to the back of her

1340
00:55:01,353 --> 00:55:04,015
hair, and stands back up.

1341
00:55:04,015 --> 00:55:05,533
TALIESIN: I'll take that. I'll take that.

1342
00:55:05,533 --> 00:55:08,569
(all laugh)

1343
00:55:08,569 --> 00:55:10,416
LAURA: Oh no!

1344
00:55:10,416 --> 00:55:12,961
MATT: That'll end its turn. Vex, you're up.

1345
00:55:12,961 --> 00:55:13,999
MARISHA: That felt like Shockwave.

1346
00:55:13,999 --> 00:55:27,917
LAURA: Oh, God. Can I, as a bonus action, give
Trinket a healing potion?

1347
00:55:27,917 --> 00:55:30,910
MATT: You can-- that would be more of an action to
feed it to something else.

1348
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:33,745
LAURA: Okay, never mind. I am going to attack it.

1349
00:55:33,806 --> 00:55:35,405
MATT: Okay.

1350
00:55:35,405 --> 00:55:42,806
LAURA: Okay. He's, oh, I missed. That's a 14.

1351
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:47,754
MATT: A 14 does not hit, unfortunately. The first
arrow just ricochets and shatters across the part

1352
00:55:47,754 --> 00:55:48,798
of its body.

1353
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:53,517
LAURA: Great. Good times, good times. 16. Both
miss. Fucking A. What a waste.

1354
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:55,759
MATT: Both arrows just explode across its hide.
It's too thick.

1355
00:55:55,759 --> 00:56:03,759
LAURA: This dice is out for the rest of the game.
I'm gonna run. Is there an outcropping where we

1356
00:56:03,759 --> 00:56:05,256
are? I can't see.

1357
00:56:05,256 --> 00:56:08,041
MATT: Right here, a little bit. If you pull fully
in on this side from where it--

1358
00:56:08,041 --> 00:56:09,591
LAURA: I'm going to pull fully in on that side.

1359
00:56:09,591 --> 00:56:11,978
MATT: Okay. Don't forget your laser pointers, by
the way, guys. It's good for letting me know

1360
00:56:11,978 --> 00:56:13,151
exactly where you want to go.

1361
00:56:13,151 --> 00:56:14,689
LAURA: I can't see.

1362
00:56:14,756 --> 00:56:16,860
MATT: I know. Just so you know. And Trinket's
going to stay there?

1363
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:19,573
LAURA: He's gonna rest. And he's going to keep
protecting Scanlan, because--

1364
00:56:19,573 --> 00:56:22,119
MATT: All right. Trinket's gonna stay right there,
guarding the giant gnome.

1365
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:24,017
SAM: Oh, thank you. Giant gnome?

1366
00:56:24,017 --> 00:56:27,759
MATT: Giant hand, small gnome. Grog, you're up.

1367
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:34,235
TRAVIS: (yells) I try and match the Godzilla roar,
it's not really as good, and I swing three times

1368
00:56:34,235 --> 00:56:35,502
with my fire hammer.

1369
00:56:35,502 --> 00:56:37,261
MATT: Go for it.

1370
00:56:38,209 --> 00:56:39,588
TRAVIS: That's a 18.

1371
00:56:39,588 --> 00:56:42,342
MATT: 18. That hits.

1372
00:56:42,342 --> 00:56:44,585
TRAVIS: 21.

1373
00:56:44,585 --> 00:56:47,078
MATT: 21 hits.

1374
00:56:47,078 --> 00:56:48,547
TRAVIS: And 19.

1375
00:56:48,547 --> 00:56:50,497
MATT: 19 hits. Roll damage.

1376
00:56:50,497 --> 00:56:51,392
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

1377
00:56:51,392 --> 00:56:55,950
TRAVIS: That anus! That's 13.

1378
00:56:55,950 --> 00:57:00,335
LAURA: Eee, good.

1379
00:57:00,335 --> 00:57:10,926
TRAVIS: 23, and 22.

1380
00:57:10,926 --> 00:57:12,581
MATT: All righty. How do you want to do this?

1381
00:57:12,644 --> 00:57:14,357
(all yell)

1382
00:57:14,357 --> 00:57:17,900
TALIESIN: But you never said he looked a little
rough! I kept waiting for you to say it's looking

1383
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,192
a little rough.

1384
00:57:19,192 --> 00:57:20,393
MATT: It's hard to tell with this entity.

1385
00:57:20,393 --> 00:57:21,318
TALIESIN: Damn it!

1386
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:22,348
MATT: It's moving so fast.

1387
00:57:22,348 --> 00:57:23,896
TRAVIS: I'd like to reach up with my firebrand
warhammer.

1388
00:57:23,896 --> 00:57:24,398
SAM: Yes!

1389
00:57:24,398 --> 00:57:28,188
TRAVIS: And I would like to smash it on top of its
skull, and when it hits the ground, I'd just like to

1390
00:57:28,188 --> 00:57:33,817
keep turning it into jelly and paste and sweet
jams that I can bottle it up and sell later!

1391
00:57:33,873 --> 00:57:38,921
MATT: You guys watch this continuous barrage, this
horrible bludgeoning. Every impact almost quakes

1392
00:57:38,921 --> 00:57:44,860
the inside of this valley. Rocks are beginning to
tumble and fall around it. And you can see, as

1393
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:51,332
each horrible, sickening smack, its head just
collapses more and more. The mush begins to spill

1394
00:57:51,332 --> 00:57:56,676
out from under it, this giant pool of, like, dark
violet liquid and gelatinous mush that was once

1395
00:57:56,676 --> 00:58:03,321
the inside of its head, begin to just grow around
it as Grog just keeps hitting and hitting and

1396
00:58:03,321 --> 00:58:07,501
hitting and hitting and hitting and hitting--

1397
00:58:07,501 --> 00:58:08,970
MARISHA: Grog? Grog?

1398
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:10,033
MATT: And hitting and hitting--

1399
00:58:10,033 --> 00:58:10,873
LAURA: Grog?

1400
00:58:10,873 --> 00:58:12,419
SAM: I use Bigby's Hand to stop the hammer.

1401
00:58:12,419 --> 00:58:19,069
LAURA: Maybe you unrage. Lullaby, Hulk.
Lullaby.

1402
00:58:19,238 --> 00:58:20,109
SAM: It's over. It's over.

1403
00:58:20,109 --> 00:58:24,149
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Lullaby?!

1404
00:58:24,149 --> 00:58:26,711
SAM: Think of the beard.

1405
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,844
TRAVIS: What happened?

1406
00:58:28,844 --> 00:58:29,648
TALIESIN: Well.

1407
00:58:29,648 --> 00:58:30,714
LAURA: You killed it real good!

1408
00:58:30,714 --> 00:58:33,597
TRAVIS: Oh, look, we made jelly.

1409
00:58:34,324 --> 00:58:37,913
MARISHA: Speaking of jelly, I would like to go
ahead and do a nature check to see if I can

1410
00:58:37,913 --> 00:58:40,886
salvage some goods from whatever.

1411
00:58:40,886 --> 00:58:45,415
LAURA: I run, I walk up to it and kick it, and
say, that's for Trinket. Dick.

1412
00:58:45,415 --> 00:58:47,396
MATT: Okay.

1413
00:58:47,396 --> 00:58:50,160
TRAVIS: Can I roll a hit dice to recover some--

1414
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,282
MATT: If you guys want to take a short rest, you
can.

1415
00:58:52,282 --> 00:58:52,919
TRAVIS: Oh.

1416
00:58:52,919 --> 00:58:53,868
LAURA: That'd be great.

1417
00:58:53,868 --> 00:58:56,478
TALIESIN: Yes! I would like to fix my gun.
Just a giant pile of tools.

1418
00:58:56,478 --> 00:59:00,537
LAURA: Do we need to hide? Do we need to climb up
to its little cave that it was in, maybe?

1419
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:01,674
And hide.

1420
00:59:01,674 --> 00:59:02,713
SAM: Did it have a cave?

1421
00:59:02,713 --> 00:59:03,570
TRAVIS: Was it in a cave?

1422
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:05,169
LAURA: It had a cave. Didn't it come out of a
cave, when we saw it?

1423
00:59:05,169 --> 00:59:07,911
MATT: You saw it was up on a higher platform, you
didn't see a cavern, or anything.

1424
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:08,986
LAURA: Oh, I thought it was a cave.

1425
00:59:08,986 --> 00:59:12,204
MARISHA: I rolled a 21 to collect goods.

1426
00:59:12,204 --> 00:59:18,727
MATT: Okay, looking through the book that you
have. You eventually take a while to look while

1427
00:59:18,727 --> 00:59:23,217
you guys are having your short rest. You can use
your hit dice to heal yourself.

1428
00:59:23,217 --> 00:59:24,652
It is known as a behir.

1429
00:59:24,652 --> 00:59:25,623
SAM: A behir?

1430
00:59:25,623 --> 00:59:27,125
MATT: B-E-H-I-R.

1431
00:59:27,125 --> 00:59:28,360
MARISHA: B-E-H-I-R.

1432
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,559
TALIESIN: Behir.

1433
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:32,088
TRAVIS: Be here.

1434
00:59:32,088 --> 00:59:33,956
LAURA: Be here right now. Be present.

1435
00:59:33,956 --> 00:59:39,118
MATT: Behir. There are two things. Anything in the
face and teeth are gone. They are just mush. The

1436
00:59:39,118 --> 00:59:40,462
entire head is destroyed.

1437
00:59:40,462 --> 00:59:41,746
MARISHA: Sure.

1438
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:48,334
MATT: The the two things in the book that are
worthwhile, like, really worth money, are some of

1439
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:57,627
its hide can be repurposed for, you know, like,
lightning resist-based armor, but currently it's

1440
00:59:57,627 --> 01:00:03,473
unknown who has the speciality to actually work
with that material. These creatures are difficult to

1441
01:00:03,473 --> 01:00:07,082
harvest and a lot of their locations are unknown.
A lot of them were hunted down for that long ago

1442
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:08,742
and almost thought to have gone extinct.

1443
01:00:08,742 --> 01:00:10,572
(all groan)

1444
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:18,057
MATT: However, yes, you don't know anybody,
possibly Karin in Emon. The hide can be harvested.

1445
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:24,325
There is also a gland in its throat that it uses
to charge its Lightning Breath.

1446
01:00:25,266 --> 01:00:27,054
TALIESIN: I'd like that.

1447
01:00:27,054 --> 01:00:28,245
MARISHA: I'd like that.

1448
01:00:28,245 --> 01:00:30,989
MATT: Go ahead and roll for the hide first, if you
guys want to go for that.

1449
01:00:31,174 --> 01:00:34,697
LAURA: Can I stealth and climb up and see if I can
see a cavern?

1450
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:35,647
MATT: Sure.

1451
01:00:35,647 --> 01:00:36,327
LAURA: A little cave.

1452
01:00:36,327 --> 01:00:37,445
MARISHA: Natural 20!

1453
01:00:37,445 --> 01:00:38,488
TRAVIS: Oh snap!

1454
01:00:38,488 --> 01:00:39,671
LAURA: Yeah!

1455
01:00:39,671 --> 01:00:41,323
TRAVIS: I'll take it.

1456
01:00:44,534 --> 01:00:47,162
SAM: She gets advantage because mountains are
her favorite terrain.

1457
01:00:47,338 --> 01:00:48,683
LAURA: What do I add to that?

1458
01:00:48,683 --> 01:00:50,020
MATT: This would be, add your--

1459
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:50,797
LAURA: Acrobatics?

1460
01:00:50,797 --> 01:00:51,979
MATT: For climb, this would be athletics.

1461
01:00:51,979 --> 01:00:56,524
LAURA: Athletics. Oh, really? That's not what it
was; I moved it.

1462
01:00:56,524 --> 01:00:57,957
LIAM: It was 14, I saw it.

1463
01:00:57,957 --> 01:01:01,494
LAURA: Oh no, 12.

1464
01:01:01,494 --> 01:01:05,384
MATT: It takes you a little bit to get up there.
It's steep, you slide down a few times. But

1465
01:01:05,384 --> 01:01:08,876
eventually, because there's no immediate threat,
you're given time to get up onto this upper

1466
01:01:08,945 --> 01:01:13,465
platform. You can see that there are these various
parts of the rock that jut outward, that have some

1467
01:01:13,465 --> 01:01:16,944
short term passageways that this creature uses.

1468
01:01:16,944 --> 01:01:20,210
LAURA: I'm so weak, but I'm holding to see if I
see a cave.

1469
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:23,792
MATT: (laughs) Roll a perception check.

1470
01:01:23,792 --> 01:01:24,815
LAURA: (groans)

1471
01:01:24,815 --> 01:01:29,954
MATT: Once you're up there. You take time and with
help from some other folks, you manage to harvest,

1472
01:01:30,028 --> 01:01:37,563
I'd say about ten pounds worth of scales at most.
It's not a whole lot. A lot of it has been torn

1473
01:01:37,563 --> 01:01:43,672
and destroyed from the impact and damage you guys
did. Parts of it are not really armory functional,

1474
01:01:43,672 --> 01:01:48,322
but you manage to get enough to maybe make one set
if somebody manages to work really well with it.

1475
01:01:48,447 --> 01:01:49,860
MARISHA: Here, Grog, bag of holding.

1476
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:50,630
LAURA: 23.

1477
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:55,352
MATT: 23? Currently, you have no eye shot on any
particular--

1478
01:01:55,352 --> 01:01:57,173
SAM: Don't eat it, Grog.

1479
01:01:57,173 --> 01:02:01,616
MATT: -- tunnels. Nothing that resembles an abode
or a cavern from this position.

1480
01:02:01,616 --> 01:02:02,745
TALIESIN: Lick it.

1481
01:02:02,745 --> 01:02:03,607
LAURA: (groans)

1482
01:02:03,607 --> 01:02:04,892
LIAM: I see my sister's struggling.

1483
01:02:04,892 --> 01:02:05,676
LAURA: Oh god it hurts.

1484
01:02:05,676 --> 01:02:07,543
LIAM: I climb up next to her.

1485
01:02:07,543 --> 01:02:09,413
LAURA: You're almost as weak as I am, dude.

1486
01:02:09,413 --> 01:02:10,179
LIAM: Yeah.

1487
01:02:10,179 --> 01:02:10,901
LAURA: Here we go.

1488
01:02:10,901 --> 01:02:11,629
LIAM: Acrobatics? What is it?

1489
01:02:11,629 --> 01:02:12,274
MATT: Athletics.

1490
01:02:12,274 --> 01:02:13,009
LAURA: Athletics.

1491
01:02:13,009 --> 01:02:13,656
TRAVIS: Athletics.

1492
01:02:13,656 --> 01:02:15,074
LIAM: Athletics? Oh, shit. Acrobatics would have
been much better.

1493
01:02:15,074 --> 01:02:15,769
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, c'mon.

1494
01:02:15,769 --> 01:02:16,444
LAURA: I know, I don't think so.

1495
01:02:16,444 --> 01:02:17,313
LIAM: Can I flip up there?

1496
01:02:17,313 --> 01:02:18,237
MATT: Eh, it doesn't work like that.

1497
01:02:18,237 --> 01:02:19,739
LIAM: No, no--

1498
01:02:19,739 --> 01:02:20,312
(all laugh)

1499
01:02:20,312 --> 01:02:20,996
TRAVIS: No, I can't.

1500
01:02:20,996 --> 01:02:21,998
LIAM: Wait, I'll use Luck. I'll do it again to
get--

1501
01:02:21,998 --> 01:02:22,562
MATT: Go for it.

1502
01:02:22,562 --> 01:02:23,328
TRAVIS: You're going to use one of your Lucks?

1503
01:02:23,328 --> 01:02:24,247
LIAM: -- to get past that one.

1504
01:02:24,247 --> 01:02:25,317
LAURA: No, we were about to rest. Wow.

1505
01:02:25,317 --> 01:02:26,049
LIAM: Oh, no, I didn't.

1506
01:02:26,049 --> 01:02:27,102
LAURA: Oh, really, you rolled worse than me.

1507
01:02:27,102 --> 01:02:30,739
LIAM: Oh no, my fingernail, that really stings.
Damn it.

1508
01:02:30,785 --> 01:02:31,758
MATT: The twins give a--

1509
01:02:31,758 --> 01:02:32,525
MARISHA: Just terrible.

1510
01:02:32,525 --> 01:02:34,953
MATT: -- terrible display of rock climbing in the
middle of this.

1511
01:02:34,953 --> 01:02:35,936
TRAVIS: I laugh heartily.

1512
01:02:35,936 --> 01:02:38,613
TALIESIN: Parkour! Parkour!

1513
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:43,234
MATT: Go ahead and roll for the glands.

1514
01:02:43,234 --> 01:02:44,012
MARISHA: The glands?

1515
01:02:44,012 --> 01:02:46,356
LIAM: Stupid video game moment of like jump, jump,
jump, jump.

1516
01:02:46,356 --> 01:02:47,591
LAURA: Like Skyrim trying to get--

1517
01:02:47,591 --> 01:02:54,830
MARISHA: Glands? 18 is not bad. I'll take that
18 for a 28. Hey, Vax, can I see your dagger?

1518
01:02:55,064 --> 01:02:56,228
LIAM: Yeah, here you go.

1519
01:02:56,228 --> 01:02:57,333
SAM: He's up a hill.

1520
01:02:57,333 --> 01:03:01,968
LAURA: Nice. We didn't even get up a little bit.

1521
01:03:01,968 --> 01:03:05,147
MATT: It takes most of your short rest. You will
not be able to use your hit dice for healing on

1522
01:03:05,147 --> 01:03:13,669
this, because you spend your time harvesting
instead. But you manage to-- thankfully, the

1523
01:03:13,834 --> 01:03:19,046
damage that Grog had inflicted upon its head
destroyed most of its matter, right up to the

1524
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:24,579
throat gland which is mostly untouched. It's
salvageable. You don't know how much it's worth.

1525
01:03:24,579 --> 01:03:28,681
Probably a decent amount, as the book says that
they're rare. Especially to find intact.

1526
01:03:28,681 --> 01:03:30,583
TRAVIS: That Grog, what a dick.

1527
01:03:30,583 --> 01:03:34,673
TALIESIN: We have jars. I'm going to put that into
the jar and put it away.

1528
01:03:34,673 --> 01:03:36,485
TRAVIS: There's not even like a tooth. Like one
broken tooth? A piece?

1529
01:03:36,485 --> 01:03:37,615
MATT: You did a number on that one's face.

1530
01:03:37,615 --> 01:03:39,100
TRAVIS: When Grog goes to work.

1531
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:42,606
LIAM Boom. Kill the behir, take its glands,
money.

1532
01:03:42,606 --> 01:03:44,473
TALIESIN: I may have something I can do with this
actually.

1533
01:03:44,473 --> 01:03:46,399
TRAVIS: With what, the gland?

1534
01:03:46,399 --> 01:03:47,867
TALIESIN: Yes.

1535
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:50,159
MARISHA: Maybe, yes. (electricity noises)

1536
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,983
TALIESIN: You're very clever, yes. We'll work on
that.

1537
01:03:52,983 --> 01:03:55,050
TRAVIS: Hello? I don't speak your language.

1538
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:56,339
MATT: You place it within a preservation jar.

1539
01:03:56,531 --> 01:03:57,141
TALIESIN: Yes.

1540
01:03:57,217 --> 01:03:58,084
MATT: Back in the bag of holding?

1541
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,105
TALIESIN: Back in the bag of holding.

1542
01:03:59,105 --> 01:03:59,785
MATT: Okay.

1543
01:03:59,785 --> 01:04:01,851
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and fix this mess, for
a minute.

1544
01:04:01,851 --> 01:04:04,116
MATT: Go ahead and make your check.

1545
01:04:05,377 --> 01:04:06,399
TALIESIN: 18.

1546
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:10,591
MATT: 18. It does cost you half the--

1547
01:04:10,591 --> 01:04:13,106
TALIESIN: It wasn't a dual fail.

1548
01:04:13,106 --> 01:04:17,399
MATT: Oh right, just a single fail. It was a dual
fail, but it was separate.

1549
01:04:17,399 --> 01:04:18,224
TALIESIN: Yes.

1550
01:04:18,224 --> 01:04:22,379
MATT: You take some time with it during the short
rest to tinker with it. You manage to bend the

1551
01:04:22,379 --> 01:04:30,262
metal back in place. Test it for a bit. Make sure
the aspects that move move smoothly as they

1552
01:04:30,262 --> 01:04:38,347
should. Eventually, you get pretty confident that
it is back to a functional piece of weaponry. All

1553
01:04:38,347 --> 01:04:41,921
right, so, as you guys finish this rest--

1554
01:04:41,921 --> 01:04:43,386
TRAVIS: I'm rolling one more hit dice.

1555
01:04:43,386 --> 01:04:50,875
MATT: Go for it. The sky is starting to get a
little bit into the orangish color. Though you can

1556
01:04:50,875 --> 01:04:55,135
not see the sun from its current location, you
gather you have about an hour and a half or so

1557
01:04:55,135 --> 01:04:57,582
before full sundown.

1558
01:04:59,113 --> 01:05:05,097
SAM: Let's get out of this little taco in case
that was the daughter of something else.

1559
01:05:05,097 --> 01:05:07,180
MATT: Wait, you guys stayed the night-- never
mind, in the cavern.

1560
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:08,923
So actually, no, I take that back.

1561
01:05:08,923 --> 01:05:09,744
SAM: Oh?

1562
01:05:09,744 --> 01:05:11,747
MATT: I just realized you guys stayed the night
last time over on the

1563
01:05:11,747 --> 01:05:13,128
seaside cavern and walked here--

1564
01:05:13,128 --> 01:05:13,830
TRAVIS: That's right.

1565
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:15,930
MATT: -- and it only took you a few hours to get
here. So, no, it'd be about mid-day noon.

1566
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:16,640
TRAVIS: Okay.

1567
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:17,703
MATT: So, I take that back. Never mind.

1568
01:05:17,703 --> 01:05:18,329
LIAM: Ah.

1569
01:05:18,329 --> 01:05:19,384
SAM: We should still go.

1570
01:05:19,384 --> 01:05:20,579
MATT: Can see the sun, it is straight above.

1571
01:05:20,579 --> 01:05:21,730
TALIESIN: We should still get out of the taco.

1572
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:23,187
MATT: There is some cloud cover coming in.

1573
01:05:23,187 --> 01:05:24,200
TRAVIS: Definitely should still leave.

1574
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:28,410
MATT: From the north side, it doesn't look like
anything too dense.

1575
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:29,021
MARISHA: Percy?

1576
01:05:29,021 --> 01:05:30,024
TALIESIN: Yes?

1577
01:05:30,024 --> 01:05:32,863
MARISHA: Do you know how much longer we need to
continue on this path?

1578
01:05:32,863 --> 01:05:40,319
TALIESIN: Honestly, I've never taken this road
before. This is further east than I've ever come.

1579
01:05:40,786 --> 01:05:46,570
MARISHA: Can we see how far ahead-- does it look
like it goes on for a while, this chasm?

1580
01:05:46,645 --> 01:05:49,608
MATT: It moves around, so it's hard to get to much
of a visual of the--

1581
01:05:49,608 --> 01:05:51,992
TALIESIN: The geology starting to look familiar?

1582
01:05:51,992 --> 01:05:54,238
LAURA: Does my tracking tell me anything?

1583
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:58,418
MATT: You can go ahead and make a nature check.

1584
01:05:58,418 --> 01:05:59,890
LIAM: For all of this, I'd like to--

1585
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:00,962
MATT: With advantage.

1586
01:06:00,962 --> 01:06:04,111
LIAM: -- walk about 40 feet in front of everyone
and creep along.

1587
01:06:04,111 --> 01:06:05,345
MATT: Okay.

1588
01:06:05,345 --> 01:06:06,053
LAURA: 17.

1589
01:06:06,053 --> 01:06:06,789
LIAM: Cloak up.

1590
01:06:06,789 --> 01:06:07,672
MATT: Make a stealth check.

1591
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:08,498
SAM: He's a weird loner, that guy.

1592
01:06:08,498 --> 01:06:09,072
TRAVIS: He is.

1593
01:06:09,072 --> 01:06:09,739
LIAM: It's my job.

1594
01:06:09,739 --> 01:06:13,429
MATT: Make a stealth check. The mountains here got
its name for the white stone mountains.

1595
01:06:13,429 --> 01:06:14,270
The rock--

1596
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:16,257
TALIESIN: It's starting to look like home, though?

1597
01:06:16,257 --> 01:06:21,597
MATT: Yeah. The mountain range here is a large
part of the material that is mined, well, was

1598
01:06:21,597 --> 01:06:28,173
mined beneath the-- It's very rare white
quartz-like rock that is used for many purposes.

1599
01:06:28,173 --> 01:06:32,333
And it's generally only found in this mountain
range. It's what a lot of the Whitestone's

1600
01:06:32,333 --> 01:06:35,076
original economy was based on.

1601
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:36,065
LIAM: 22.

1602
01:06:36,065 --> 01:06:37,776
MATT: 22, good to know. All right, so.

1603
01:06:37,776 --> 01:06:40,970
LAURA: 17 on nature.

1604
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:44,261
MATT: Okay. I mean, you gather the same thing. The
rock formations here match the same as the coastal

1605
01:06:44,261 --> 01:06:50,416
mountains. The mountain here is all made of the
same material, few deposits here and there of just

1606
01:06:50,416 --> 01:06:53,949
normal bits of granite and other forms of simple
stone.

1607
01:06:55,658 --> 01:06:56,687
LAURA: Granite.

1608
01:06:56,687 --> 01:06:57,409
SAM: Oh.

1609
01:06:57,409 --> 01:06:58,146
LAURA: Simple stone.

1610
01:06:58,146 --> 01:06:59,370
(all laugh)

1611
01:06:59,370 --> 01:07:01,321
TRAVIS: That was so much better than shopping.

1612
01:07:01,321 --> 01:07:03,999
(all laugh)

1613
01:07:03,999 --> 01:07:13,762
MATT: As you guys are pressing forward, at this
point, you guys are taking your time waiting and

1614
01:07:13,887 --> 01:07:23,436
Tiberius is getting impatient, and is crossing his
arms. "I feel like I should have gotten more

1615
01:07:23,436 --> 01:07:26,046
"materials. I don't think I'm quite prepared enough
for this."

1616
01:07:26,046 --> 01:07:29,197
LAURA: What? Tiberius, you prepared a lot.

1617
01:07:29,197 --> 01:07:30,245
LIAM: Tibs.

1618
01:07:30,245 --> 01:07:31,469
MATT: "Not enough. Never enough".

1619
01:07:31,469 --> 01:07:35,276
LIAM: You brought along a sack of mirrors, I think
you've got enough. What do you need?

1620
01:07:35,276 --> 01:07:37,937
MATT: "I have an idea. I'll be back in a few
days."

1621
01:07:37,937 --> 01:07:39,701
ALL: What, no?

1622
01:07:39,701 --> 01:07:40,710
SAM: Don't leave.

1623
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:43,337
MATT: He sits down and starts making his
teleportation circle.

1624
01:07:43,337 --> 01:07:44,801
LAURA: No, no, we need that!

1625
01:07:44,801 --> 01:07:45,556
LIAM: Tiberius.

1626
01:07:45,556 --> 01:07:46,109
LAURA: We need that.

1627
01:07:46,109 --> 01:07:46,798
LIAM: Tiberius.

1628
01:07:46,798 --> 01:07:47,535
LAURA: We need that. Tiberius.

1629
01:07:47,535 --> 01:07:51,830
LIAM: You are a heavy hitter, we don't know where
we're going, what we're doing. He's strong. You're

1630
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:55,062
strong, in a way, maybe hang out a little bit
longer.

1631
01:07:55,062 --> 01:07:57,186
LAURA: He's actually got a lot of hit points, really.

1632
01:07:57,186 --> 01:07:58,592
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's got a lot.

1633
01:07:58,646 --> 01:07:59,654
MATT: (laughs)

1634
01:07:59,654 --> 01:08:04,294
LIAM: More than I do. You're stronger in frame
than I am. Sure you want to go?

1635
01:08:04,294 --> 01:08:07,239
MATT: Tiberius leans in and whispers to you in a
strange tongue and it sparks in your ear

1636
01:08:07,239 --> 01:08:11,371
somewhere. (whispers) "The player's not here and
the DM's trying to not make it too complicated for

1637
01:08:11,371 --> 01:08:13,763
"him to keep track of an additional character for
this session."

1638
01:08:13,833 --> 01:08:14,936
(all laugh)

1639
01:08:14,936 --> 01:08:15,847
LAURA: I understand that.

1640
01:08:15,847 --> 01:08:17,887
LIAM: (whispers) I know, but I'm just trying to
give you a hard time.

1641
01:08:17,887 --> 01:08:19,357
(all laugh)

1642
01:08:19,357 --> 01:08:20,572
MATT: I'll remember that.

1643
01:08:20,572 --> 01:08:21,455
LAURA: Oh, no.

1644
01:08:21,455 --> 01:08:24,308
TALIESIN: I grab Lockheed and we hold him
hostage.

1645
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:26,465
(all laugh)

1646
01:08:26,465 --> 01:08:27,797
MARISHA: You can't leave!

1647
01:08:27,797 --> 01:08:28,683
(all laugh)

1648
01:08:28,683 --> 01:08:29,954
LAURA: We need you.

1649
01:08:29,954 --> 01:08:33,282
MATT: "Don't worry, I'll be back soon and now I
know how to find you."

1650
01:08:33,282 --> 01:08:35,736
LIAM: (whispers) Send an iPad with Pike on it.

1651
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:38,523
(all laugh)

1652
01:08:38,523 --> 01:08:43,412
MATT: He finishes his teleportation circle and
with a whoosh, with a flash, vanishes.

1653
01:08:43,412 --> 01:08:46,811
LAURA: Shit. Really, Tiberius, really?

1654
01:08:46,811 --> 01:08:47,881
MARISHA: He does that a lot.

1655
01:08:47,881 --> 01:08:49,450
SAM: It's very much in his character.

1656
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:50,376
LAURA: (groans)

1657
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:51,945
TRAVIS: Where'd Tiberius go?

1658
01:08:51,945 --> 01:08:53,369
LIAM: He went to get an army, I think.

1659
01:08:53,369 --> 01:08:54,702
LAURA: (groans)

1660
01:08:54,702 --> 01:08:55,481
TRAVIS: That's fine.

1661
01:08:55,481 --> 01:08:56,862
TALIESIN: Or more mirrors.

1662
01:08:56,862 --> 01:08:58,256
MARISHA: It might be more mirrors.

1663
01:08:58,256 --> 01:08:59,424
TALIESIN: Or an army with mirrors.

1664
01:08:59,424 --> 01:09:02,165
MARISHA: An army with mirrors.

1665
01:09:02,165 --> 01:09:07,147
LIAM: I can do magic. I do this great coin trick
thing where I flip it on my thumb and then it

1666
01:09:07,147 --> 01:09:08,264
lands in my hand.

1667
01:09:08,264 --> 01:09:09,156
LAURA: And then, you pull it--

1668
01:09:09,156 --> 01:09:10,064
LIAM: That's the end of it.

1669
01:09:10,064 --> 01:09:10,926
LAURA: -- out of someone's ear.

1670
01:09:10,926 --> 01:09:11,702
LIAM: It's right here.

1671
01:09:11,702 --> 01:09:12,479
LAURA: Whoa!

1672
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:14,043
TRAVIS: We start walking.

1673
01:09:14,043 --> 01:09:14,866
MARISHA: That's fun.

1674
01:09:14,866 --> 01:09:15,770
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I'm walking.

1675
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:16,645
MATT: Progressing forward--

1676
01:09:16,645 --> 01:09:17,573
MARISHA: It's a start.

1677
01:09:17,573 --> 01:09:19,438
MATT: -- you begin to--

1678
01:09:19,438 --> 01:09:21,857
TRAVIS: Jauntily stealth ahead.

1679
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:24,653
LIAM: 40 feet out, yeah.

1680
01:09:24,917 --> 01:09:26,169
TRAVIS: Like a beagle.

1681
01:09:26,169 --> 01:09:29,722
LAURA: I keep a perception out to see anything.

1682
01:09:29,722 --> 01:09:32,149
TALIESIN: I'm keeping an eye open for anything
familiar.

1683
01:09:32,149 --> 01:09:41,853
SAM: Can I just bump into Vex and ask her to maybe
scan ahead for dragons?

1684
01:09:41,853 --> 01:09:43,588
LAURA: What do you think I'm doing?

1685
01:09:43,588 --> 01:09:44,770
SAM: Dragons, though. Six miles.

1686
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:45,588
LAURA: I'm scanning.

1687
01:09:45,588 --> 01:09:49,758
SAM: Don't you have six miles of dragons or
something? Thank you.

1688
01:09:49,758 --> 01:09:50,961
TALIESIN: Do you have to do the hands?

1689
01:09:50,961 --> 01:09:51,855
TRAVIS: Is that your scanning face?

1690
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:52,763
MATT: It's good to help out in the--

1691
01:09:52,763 --> 01:09:53,488
LAURA: I'm thinking.

1692
01:09:53,488 --> 01:09:54,272
SAM: Six miles of dragons.

1693
01:09:54,272 --> 01:09:57,950
LAURA: I'm wanting to see if I see any dragons. Do
I see any dragons?

1694
01:09:57,950 --> 01:09:59,264
TRAVIS: I thought you did a different technique
last time.

1695
01:09:59,264 --> 01:10:04,527
MATT: You take a moment and anticipate the
circumstance, and there is, within-- what's the

1696
01:10:04,527 --> 01:10:05,475
distance on it?

1697
01:10:05,475 --> 01:10:06,719
ALL: Six miles.

1698
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:07,573
MATT: Six miles?

1699
01:10:07,573 --> 01:10:08,244
LIAM: Yeah, man.

1700
01:10:08,244 --> 01:10:15,030
MATT: You ascertain that there are quite a few
sources of life in this vicinity, of some sort of

1701
01:10:15,030 --> 01:10:17,803
dragon kin or dragon-like entity.

1702
01:10:17,803 --> 01:10:22,598
LAURA: Was the behir a dragony sort of thing?

1703
01:10:22,598 --> 01:10:29,152
MATT: No. Technically not, from what you can
gather, but you do gather there are a few blips

1704
01:10:29,152 --> 01:10:33,989
that are three miles off north, at the center of
the mountain range. You don't know how big or how

1705
01:10:33,989 --> 01:10:39,437
dangerous, but you sense there are some dragon or
dragon kin sources.

1706
01:10:39,437 --> 01:10:41,192
LAURA: There's a dragony something.

1707
01:10:41,192 --> 01:10:43,267
SAM: Could be dragon eggs.

1708
01:10:43,267 --> 01:10:44,235
MARISHA: Dragonborn?

1709
01:10:44,235 --> 01:10:45,319
LAURA: I don't know, Scanlan.

1710
01:10:45,319 --> 01:10:47,509
MARISHA: You're not picking up Tiberius six miles
away?

1711
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:48,705
LAURA: There's dragony things, though.

1712
01:10:48,705 --> 01:10:52,088
SAM: Listen. When I poo somewhere, I can see
everything.

1713
01:10:52,088 --> 01:10:55,576
LAURA: I didn't poo. I'm sensing with my mind.

1714
01:10:55,576 --> 01:10:59,941
TRAVIS: Listen, if we do run across a dragon,
remember we have the dragon slayer longsword,

1715
01:10:59,996 --> 01:11:04,263
which is a plus one to attack and damage rolls,
and if you hit a dragon or a dragon creature, it

1716
01:11:04,263 --> 01:11:06,313
gets an extra 3d6 of damage.

1717
01:11:06,313 --> 01:11:08,261
LAURA: What are you reading? How did you even know
that?

1718
01:11:08,261 --> 01:11:10,621
TALIESIN: That's the most complicated sentence I
think I've ever heard you speak.

1719
01:11:10,621 --> 01:11:12,314
TRAVIS: Sorry, I blacked out for a little bit.

1720
01:11:12,314 --> 01:11:15,087
(all laugh)

1721
01:11:15,087 --> 01:11:15,847
TALIESIN: Nothing.

1722
01:11:15,847 --> 01:11:17,400
LAURA: Nothing. You're good, Grog.

1723
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:21,970
TRAVIS: What do you have to do to attunement?

1724
01:11:22,204 --> 01:11:26,500
MATT: Attunement, you take a short rest with the
weapon, learning its properties.

1725
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:27,830
TRAVIS: Caressing it?

1726
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:30,641
MATT: Essentially. Stroking it, making sure it
feels comfortable.

1727
01:11:30,641 --> 01:11:31,599
TALIESIN: Buying it dinner.

1728
01:11:31,599 --> 01:11:33,793
MATT: Nice spread so it feels welcome.

1729
01:11:33,793 --> 01:11:34,850
TRAVIS: That's more than I usually do.

1730
01:11:34,850 --> 01:11:38,673
LAURA: Maybe a steak, some salad. Shrimp
cocktail.

1731
01:11:38,673 --> 01:11:40,930
TRAVIS: Just in case you need a sword.

1732
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:48,006
LIAM: As we progress, I say into my earring,
Scanlan, I've seen some of the logs she's left

1733
01:11:48,006 --> 01:11:49,814
behind. They're not small.

1734
01:11:49,814 --> 01:11:53,093
LAURA: (gasps) You are seriously. What?

1735
01:11:53,093 --> 01:11:53,871
TALIESIN: Wow.

1736
01:11:53,871 --> 01:11:54,789
LAURA: That's disgusting.

1737
01:11:54,789 --> 01:11:56,584
TRAVIS: I missed it. It must be good, though.

1738
01:11:56,584 --> 01:11:58,047
SAM: She usually buries them quite well.

1739
01:11:58,047 --> 01:12:00,558
LAURA: Really gross, both of you. Enough.

1740
01:12:00,558 --> 01:12:01,983
LIAM: They don't sense anything.

1741
01:12:01,983 --> 01:12:03,457
SAM: All right.

1742
01:12:03,457 --> 01:12:04,761
TALIESIN: Well, we're not heading north.

1743
01:12:04,761 --> 01:12:06,320
SAM: We're not?

1744
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,531
MATT: You guys are heading eastish.

1745
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:10,857
TALIESIN: Westish. We're heading westish.

1746
01:12:10,857 --> 01:12:11,578
LAURA: Nothing that I can sense.

1747
01:12:11,578 --> 01:12:12,435
TRAVIS: Can we keep walking?

1748
01:12:12,435 --> 01:12:15,392
MATT: You guys came up on the eastern side--
sorry, the western side of the mountains. You're

1749
01:12:15,392 --> 01:12:16,130
now heading eastward.

1750
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:17,227
TALIESIN: Oh, we came up on the western side of
the mountains?

1751
01:12:17,227 --> 01:12:18,601
LAURA: There's nothing that we're going to run
across.

1752
01:12:18,601 --> 01:12:22,328
LIAM: Just flip that.

1753
01:12:22,328 --> 01:12:23,537
MARISHA: Western side of the mountains?

1754
01:12:23,537 --> 01:12:27,636
TALIESIN: Western side of the mountains? So
Whitestone's to the east?

1755
01:12:27,636 --> 01:12:28,999
MATT: Whitestone would be to the east of you
guys.

1756
01:12:28,999 --> 01:12:33,144
TALIESIN: Oh, okay. I thought we went up the
eastern side of the mountains. I'm so confused.

1757
01:12:33,144 --> 01:12:34,747
You wouldn't think I'd lived here before.

1758
01:12:34,747 --> 01:12:36,692
MATT: That would have brought you through the
forest, and you were trying to avoid that. That's

1759
01:12:36,692 --> 01:12:37,754
what I thought you said last time.

1760
01:12:37,754 --> 01:12:39,227
TALIESIN: No, that's very true. Oh, god.

1761
01:12:39,227 --> 01:12:41,740
TRAVIS: West side's on the shore side, right? Ocean's
there?

1762
01:12:41,939 --> 01:12:45,215
MATT: There's a giant peninsula to the north.
Either side would have been coast.

1763
01:12:45,215 --> 01:12:46,732
LAURA: So we're not going to run into any
dragons?

1764
01:12:46,732 --> 01:12:47,821
SAM: At least we're not going north.

1765
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:51,239
MATT: You're aware that they're not anywhere close
to you to currently be an issue, no.

1766
01:12:51,239 --> 01:12:52,342
LAURA: Okay, we're fine.

1767
01:12:52,342 --> 01:12:53,822
TALIESIN: In two or three miles, we'll take
another check.

1768
01:12:53,822 --> 01:12:55,821
LAURA: Yeah.

1769
01:12:55,821 --> 01:12:58,723
TRAVIS: (laughs) He winked at me!

1770
01:12:58,723 --> 01:13:00,320
MATT: All right, so.

1771
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,794
TRAVIS: It's like being blessed.

1772
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:03,466
SAM: We're going to just keep going towards the
town.

1773
01:13:03,466 --> 01:13:07,299
MATT: You guys press on, following this winding
path that narrows at certain points and then

1774
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:16,804
widens for a bit. You come across, partway
through, the twins at the front notice, around the

1775
01:13:16,804 --> 01:13:22,877
edges as it begins to descend down into the
beginning of the valley descent, you see an edge

1776
01:13:22,877 --> 01:13:29,539
of the mountain that looks more angular than the
usual natural formations of it. It almost looks

1777
01:13:29,539 --> 01:13:33,988
like it comes to a point, like a very sharp edge,
and a smooth side.

1778
01:13:34,774 --> 01:13:37,590
LIAM: I'm not sure I understand. We see a
drop-off?

1779
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:41,832
MATT: It begins to descend towards the valley, and
on the side of one of the giant--

1780
01:13:41,832 --> 01:13:42,916
TRAVIS: Chasms?

1781
01:13:42,916 --> 01:13:47,353
MATT: Chasm you guys are at the bottom of. You see
an outcropping ahead that's angular and pointed.

1782
01:13:47,353 --> 01:13:48,986
SAM: Like, designed by man?

1783
01:13:48,986 --> 01:13:51,338
MATT: Like it was sculpted, constructed.

1784
01:13:51,338 --> 01:13:52,570
TRAVIS: That might have sentries.

1785
01:13:52,570 --> 01:13:57,879
LIAM: Some sort of outlook or something. Something
that was not formed by nature here.

1786
01:13:57,879 --> 01:13:59,266
TALIESIN: Do I know what this is?

1787
01:13:59,266 --> 01:14:01,212
MATT: You--

1788
01:14:01,212 --> 01:14:04,619
TALIESIN: History check?

1789
01:14:04,619 --> 01:14:08,875
MATT: I'd say, make an intelligence check. Roll
and add your intelligence modifier.

1790
01:14:08,875 --> 01:14:10,850
TRAVIS: I could do it with you, if you want.

1791
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:13,255
MATT: You can make a history check. You know many
things that exist here in the mountains, but at

1792
01:14:13,255 --> 01:14:15,906
this distance, you don't see enough of it to
actually--

1793
01:14:15,906 --> 01:14:17,963
LAURA: (shocked noise)

1794
01:14:17,963 --> 01:14:19,124
TRAVIS: He's not going to let me do it.

1795
01:14:19,124 --> 01:14:20,295
LAURA: He rolled a natural 20.

1796
01:14:20,295 --> 01:14:21,052
MATT: For?

1797
01:14:21,052 --> 01:14:23,230
TRAVIS: An intelligence check, because I'm an
idiot.

1798
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:24,299
SAM: He doesn't know the--

1799
01:14:24,299 --> 01:14:27,041
TALIESIN: I kind of want Grog to speak truth right
here.

1800
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:28,864
LAURA: He's an expert on mountains.

1801
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:34,356
MATT: Actually, this works out interestingly. As
you guys are walking forward and you're seeing

1802
01:14:34,356 --> 01:14:39,914
this, and you're keeping back, Grog, you
instinctively look over and go, oh. That's a

1803
01:14:39,914 --> 01:14:42,514
stone giant fortress.

1804
01:14:42,514 --> 01:14:45,230
ALL: Oh!

1805
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:46,657
MARISHA: Shut up!

1806
01:14:46,657 --> 01:14:48,352
TRAVIS: (laughs) I did something smart!

1807
01:14:48,352 --> 01:14:50,306
(all laugh)

1808
01:14:50,306 --> 01:14:53,741
MATT: With your bloodline and knowing where you
come from, and you've had a few close encounters

1809
01:14:53,741 --> 01:14:58,573
in the Cliffkeep Mountains with a few of this
kind, you've seen a few fortresses, and from the

1810
01:14:58,573 --> 01:15:04,123
details of it, the way of the roof, and the scope
of its design, and the way the mountain range

1811
01:15:04,123 --> 01:15:08,827
lends itself to that type of topography, yeah.
This is obviously a stone giant fortress.

1812
01:15:08,827 --> 01:15:12,886
TRAVIS: Oh, and I drank some of that nasty dank in
the fight with the Hammer, round two.

1813
01:15:12,886 --> 01:15:15,012
SAM: Wait, should we-- those are bad guys, right?

1814
01:15:15,012 --> 01:15:15,964
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's bad.

1815
01:15:15,964 --> 01:15:16,986
SAM: We should not go that way.

1816
01:15:16,986 --> 01:15:18,436
LAURA: We should definitely stay away from that.

1817
01:15:18,436 --> 01:15:21,194
TRAVIS: Maybe go up on the other side of the chasm
opposite of it?

1818
01:15:21,194 --> 01:15:22,713
MATT: Or you can move around the side, you're
welcome to.

1819
01:15:22,713 --> 01:15:24,562
LAURA: Maybe hide and make sure we're
hidey-hidey?

1820
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:26,462
SAM: We could stealth through it, we could
invisible through it.

1821
01:15:26,462 --> 01:15:27,718
MARISHA: Pass Without a Trace.

1822
01:15:27,718 --> 01:15:28,581
TRAVIS: Pass Without a Trace.

1823
01:15:28,581 --> 01:15:29,512
LAURA: I have Pass Without a Trace.

1824
01:15:29,512 --> 01:15:30,829
TRAVIS: And climb along the opposite side.

1825
01:15:30,829 --> 01:15:32,161
LAURA: And do we have invisibil--oh, no.

1826
01:15:32,161 --> 01:15:33,368
TALIESIN: No, we don't, no.

1827
01:15:33,368 --> 01:15:34,126
LAURA: You have--

1828
01:15:34,126 --> 01:15:35,530
SAM: I have some invisibility. Not great, though.

1829
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:38,752
TRAVIS: I have dust of tracelessness.

1830
01:15:38,752 --> 01:15:39,756
LAURA: Maybe we'll stealth it.

1831
01:15:39,756 --> 01:15:43,099
LIAM: Can I hide Scanlan under my cloak? Can he
use his invisibility on someone else?

1832
01:15:43,099 --> 01:15:48,316
MATT: If he was to cast Invisibility on you--

1833
01:15:48,316 --> 01:15:51,054
LIAM: No, on somebody else, so I'd just hide him.

1834
01:15:51,054 --> 01:15:52,890
TRAVIS: What about one of those things that always
works on me--

1835
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:53,911
MATT: You could--

1836
01:15:53,911 --> 01:15:55,048
TRAVIS: -- a diversion?

1837
01:15:55,048 --> 01:15:58,057
MATT: You would move very slow and you would have
disadvantage on your stealth checks because you

1838
01:15:58,057 --> 01:15:59,665
guys don't have a way to move quietly.

1839
01:15:59,665 --> 01:16:00,485
LIAM: All right, all right.

1840
01:16:00,485 --> 01:16:01,550
LAURA: No, I don't want to bring any attention.

1841
01:16:01,550 --> 01:16:03,256
MARISHA: I could create a diversion.

1842
01:16:03,256 --> 01:16:04,291
SAM: What kind?

1843
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:05,528
LAURA: Like what?

1844
01:16:05,528 --> 01:16:12,372
MARISHA: I mean, I could-- What's nearby? Is
anything nearby? Any animals? Have we seen any

1845
01:16:12,372 --> 01:16:13,649
wildlife?

1846
01:16:13,649 --> 01:16:17,780
MATT: There have been birds that fly through, an
occasional harpy, in the distance you hear

1847
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:21,181
screeching and you guys keep quiet until it
vanishes and disappears.

1848
01:16:21,181 --> 01:16:22,808
(screech in the background music)

1849
01:16:22,808 --> 01:16:23,481
TALIESIN: Wow.

1850
01:16:23,481 --> 01:16:24,581
TRAVIS: That was perfect timing!

1851
01:16:24,581 --> 01:16:26,915
LAURA: How'd that happen? How did that frickin'
happen?

1852
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,184
TRAVIS: His ways are mysterious, my love.

1853
01:16:28,184 --> 01:16:29,422
LAURA: You are magic.

1854
01:16:29,422 --> 01:16:30,896
MATT: I am lucky.

1855
01:16:30,896 --> 01:16:32,827
TALIESIN: Holy cow.

1856
01:16:32,827 --> 01:16:38,045
MATT: What were some seafaring like seagulls and
various coastal birds have slowly been

1857
01:16:38,045 --> 01:16:43,790
disappearing and turning into more eagles and
hawks, things that eat small rodents, more of a

1858
01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:47,581
lush side of the hill. You see as you get closer
to the valley itself that the actual forest that

1859
01:16:47,581 --> 01:16:51,929
surrounds Whitestone is more and more of these
birds of prey are beginning to show up. Other than

1860
01:16:51,929 --> 01:16:55,627
that, you see very few small things other than
occasional lizards about that big in your hand

1861
01:16:55,627 --> 01:16:58,157
that live on hot rocks.

1862
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:03,314
TALIESIN: Should we observe this encampment for a
bit, just to see what's happening as we slowly

1863
01:17:03,314 --> 01:17:04,396
make our way around it?

1864
01:17:04,396 --> 01:17:05,889
LAURA: Can we see any kind of movement? It's
really far away, or--?

1865
01:17:05,889 --> 01:17:06,700
TRAVIS: Couldn't hurt.

1866
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:08,703
MATT: It's still a ways away right now, you're
just catching the edge of it.

1867
01:17:08,703 --> 01:17:11,774
SAM: Are we a mile away? A thousand feet away?

1868
01:17:11,774 --> 01:17:14,583
MATT: I'd say you're about a good 600, 700 feet
from it.

1869
01:17:14,583 --> 01:17:16,536
LIAM: That's not that far.

1870
01:17:16,536 --> 01:17:20,245
TRAVIS: You know, we could try to work our way up
the opposite side of the chasm.

1871
01:17:20,245 --> 01:17:22,905
TALIESIN: That would also allow us a good view of
it as well.

1872
01:17:22,905 --> 01:17:27,581
MARISHA: I happen to have Hallucinatory Terrain
right now.

1873
01:17:27,581 --> 01:17:29,220
SAM: What does that even mean?

1874
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:31,034
MARISHA: It means exactly what it sounds like.

1875
01:17:31,034 --> 01:17:35,134
SAM: I don't speak your language.

1876
01:17:35,134 --> 01:17:39,858
MARISHA: I can make terrain that's not real.

1877
01:17:39,858 --> 01:17:42,298
LIAM: Do you remember when we psyched out the
duergar--

1878
01:17:42,298 --> 01:17:44,545
SAM: It would block their view of us maybe?
Perhaps?

1879
01:17:44,545 --> 01:17:45,768
LAURA: Is it movable?

1880
01:17:45,768 --> 01:17:46,871
TRAVIS: Yeah, it can't move with us.

1881
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:48,063
MARISHA: It could block their view of us.

1882
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:49,405
LIAM: Can you make some shrubs to come along with
us?

1883
01:17:49,405 --> 01:17:52,115
MATT: You guys actually used it previously to camp
for a night along a cliffside.

1884
01:17:52,115 --> 01:17:52,914
LAURA: Right.

1885
01:17:52,914 --> 01:17:54,824
MATT: And made the cliff extend further than it
was.

1886
01:17:54,824 --> 01:17:58,534
LIAM: Yeah, we lured a bunch of duergar into a
chasm that the ground extended over.

1887
01:17:58,534 --> 01:18:03,274
LAURA: Let's try to climb up the other side and
then see what we can see.

1888
01:18:03,274 --> 01:18:06,963
MARISHA: I mean, I can do a lot of things, I can
make a thunderstorm, I can make a sleet storm.

1889
01:18:06,963 --> 01:18:08,780
SAM: That would keep them in their fortress.

1890
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:10,097
TRAVIS: Could you make it fire?

1891
01:18:10,097 --> 01:18:10,894
MARISHA: I could.

1892
01:18:10,894 --> 01:18:11,659
TALIESIN: Or very cold if they came out.

1893
01:18:11,659 --> 01:18:12,507
LAURA: They like cold.

1894
01:18:12,507 --> 01:18:13,260
TALIESIN: Oh, yes.

1895
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:14,266
MARISHA: I could, I could make a big storm.

1896
01:18:14,266 --> 01:18:19,385
TRAVIS: We're also on a chasm, so if it gets wet
and slippery and muddy we might all go down.

1897
01:18:19,385 --> 01:18:20,306
TALIESIN: That's true.

1898
01:18:20,306 --> 01:18:21,891
LAURA: Maybe get up at the top of it and then do
this.

1899
01:18:21,891 --> 01:18:25,860
TALIESIN: I like the plan of going up the other
side of the chasm.

1900
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:26,964
LAURA: Can we try to climb the other side?

1901
01:18:26,964 --> 01:18:27,826
MATT: Certainly.

1902
01:18:27,826 --> 01:18:30,361
LIAM: Giants like to throw fucking boulders.

1903
01:18:30,361 --> 01:18:31,821
LAURA: Yeah, I don't wanna be down on the bottom.

1904
01:18:31,821 --> 01:18:33,039
LIAM: Yeah.

1905
01:18:33,039 --> 01:18:36,518
MATT: As you guys make your way up the other side,
you're helping each other, I want everyone to go

1906
01:18:36,518 --> 01:18:37,964
ahead and make an athletics check.

1907
01:18:37,964 --> 01:18:40,950
SAM: I put on my climbing gear, which I definitely
own.

1908
01:18:41,023 --> 01:18:42,222
MARISHA: An athletics check?

1909
01:18:42,222 --> 01:18:43,353
MATT: Okay, giving you advantage on your athletics
check.

1910
01:18:43,353 --> 01:18:44,854
LAURA: I actually own climbing gear too, does that
help?

1911
01:18:44,854 --> 01:18:45,624
MATT: That would help you, yes.

1912
01:18:45,624 --> 01:18:46,336
LAURA: Okay.

1913
01:18:46,336 --> 01:18:47,762
TRAVIS: I have mine too, so I'll put that on as
well.

1914
01:18:47,762 --> 01:18:49,081
MARISHA: I don't know if I have climbing--

1915
01:18:49,081 --> 01:18:50,757
TALIESIN: I don't know if I have climbing gear.

1916
01:18:50,757 --> 01:18:52,555
TRAVIS: Attached to a rope and a grappling hook
that's in my hand.

1917
01:18:52,555 --> 01:18:54,700
SAM: And it was the same. (laughs)

1918
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,117
MATT: All right. So.

1919
01:18:56,117 --> 01:18:57,462
SAM: What am I doing? Adding what?

1920
01:18:57,462 --> 01:18:58,544
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah! Nipple tits.

1921
01:18:58,544 --> 01:19:01,642
MATT: You have advantage, you add your strength
modifier. Or your athletics is what it would be.

1922
01:19:01,642 --> 01:19:02,512
SAM: Athletics.

1923
01:19:02,512 --> 01:19:04,842
LAURA: Do we add anything because of the climbing
gear or is it?

1924
01:19:04,842 --> 01:19:06,004
MATT: You get advantage because of the climbing
gear.

1925
01:19:06,004 --> 01:19:06,626
LAURA: Ah, that's important.

1926
01:19:06,626 --> 01:19:07,380
TRAVIS: 26.

1927
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:08,282
MATT: 26.

1928
01:19:08,282 --> 01:19:09,355
LIAM: We were all using climbing gear or just--

1929
01:19:09,355 --> 01:19:10,329
MATT: No, those who have it.

1930
01:19:10,329 --> 01:19:13,788
LAURA: I give you my climbing gear because I
already get advantage. How about that? Does that

1931
01:19:13,788 --> 01:19:14,808
count? No.

1932
01:19:14,808 --> 01:19:16,495
MATT: Because it is mountain? All right, I'll let
you do that.

1933
01:19:16,495 --> 01:19:17,621
LAURA: All right.

1934
01:19:17,621 --> 01:19:18,633
LIAM: All right, well, I got 19.

1935
01:19:18,633 --> 01:19:19,587
MATT: 19.

1936
01:19:19,587 --> 01:19:20,435
LAURA: Oh, so you don't need that.

1937
01:19:20,435 --> 01:19:21,263
LIAM: Yes I do, I need it.

1938
01:19:21,263 --> 01:19:22,352
SAM: 11.

1939
01:19:22,352 --> 01:19:23,112
TRAVIS: 26.

1940
01:19:23,112 --> 01:19:24,375
MATT: 26. Vex, what did you get?

1941
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:25,489
LAURA: I got 15.

1942
01:19:25,489 --> 01:19:26,554
MARISHA: 11.

1943
01:19:26,554 --> 01:19:28,194
TALIESIN: 19.

1944
01:19:28,194 --> 01:19:33,942
MATT: Okay. A couple of missteps and almost
sliding, Keyleth, at one point, you grasp her by

1945
01:19:33,942 --> 01:19:36,622
the hand and Grog pulls her back up onto the
platform.

1946
01:19:36,622 --> 01:19:37,951
TRAVIS: No, no, up here.

1947
01:19:37,951 --> 01:19:38,837
MARISHA: Thanks, Grog.

1948
01:19:38,837 --> 01:19:43,788
MATT: Over time, you guys make your way along this
very rocky and precarious, anywhere from five to

1949
01:19:43,788 --> 01:19:48,325
three to two feet in width, sometimes even lesser
than that and you guys are having to shimmy

1950
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:54,657
across. You make your way around and you can see
this large fortress that is built out of extremely

1951
01:19:54,657 --> 01:20:02,015
large and in-place stones and stonework. It looks
ancient. For size-wise, it's two stories for a

1952
01:20:02,015 --> 01:20:05,843
giant, which means it's probably close to six or
seven stories of height.

1953
01:20:05,843 --> 01:20:06,926
LAURA: Whoa.

1954
01:20:06,926 --> 01:20:11,975
MATT: Built into the side of a mountain, and it
goes down almost like two giant steps. It's built

1955
01:20:11,975 --> 01:20:18,783
on essentially where the giant bowl, the caldera
if you will, of where this valley of this mountain

1956
01:20:18,783 --> 01:20:22,514
range would be. It's built on the inside of it, so
it's actually constructed, as you continue to descend

1957
01:20:22,514 --> 01:20:29,534
into the valley. Looking at it, you can see
openings, windows, there are areas up top where

1958
01:20:29,767 --> 01:20:33,953
you see giant piles of rocks and boulders that are
used for anti-siege, for throwing off the top,

1959
01:20:33,953 --> 01:20:38,594
stockpiles of that. You do see boulders around the
ground that may have been thrown and not picked

1960
01:20:38,594 --> 01:20:43,677
up. Everyone make a perception check.

1961
01:20:44,985 --> 01:20:49,329
LAURA: I feel-- (whispers) Should I say?

1962
01:20:49,329 --> 01:20:50,638
LIAM: (whispers) I'm not gonna tell you.

1963
01:20:50,638 --> 01:20:51,270
TALIESIN: That's an intimidation check.

1964
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:52,812
LAURA: How did Trinket get up the cavern?

1965
01:20:52,812 --> 01:20:53,486
MATT: Hm?

1966
01:20:53,486 --> 01:20:54,278
LAURA: Can Trinket climb?

1967
01:20:54,278 --> 01:20:54,953
MATT: Trinket--

1968
01:20:54,953 --> 01:20:55,782
TALIESIN: Bears climb!

1969
01:20:55,782 --> 01:20:56,727
MARISHA: Bears are good climbers.

1970
01:20:56,727 --> 01:20:57,328
LAURA: They're good climbers?

1971
01:20:57,328 --> 01:20:58,161
TALIESIN: They can get up a tree.

1972
01:20:58,161 --> 01:20:58,772
MARISHA: Yeah.

1973
01:20:58,772 --> 01:21:00,338
MATT: Roll an athletics check with disadvantage.

1974
01:21:00,338 --> 01:21:02,113
SAM: Disadvantage.

1975
01:21:02,113 --> 01:21:03,771
LAURA: I'm sorry! But it felt wrong to lie.

1976
01:21:03,771 --> 01:21:04,343
MATT: Rangers.

1977
01:21:04,343 --> 01:21:05,730
SAM: Of course. It's an honor system.

1978
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:09,186
LIAM: Could I have given the climbing gear to
Trinket?

1979
01:21:09,186 --> 01:21:09,735
LAURA: No.

1980
01:21:09,735 --> 01:21:10,475
TRAVIS: No.

1981
01:21:10,475 --> 01:21:11,204
(all laugh)

1982
01:21:11,204 --> 01:21:12,555
TALIESIN: You could've, it just would've been
adorable.

1983
01:21:12,555 --> 01:21:14,463
LAURA: But we could tie the rope around Trinket's
waist.

1984
01:21:14,463 --> 01:21:17,484
MATT: Roll your dice.

1985
01:21:17,484 --> 01:21:18,887
LAURA: With an athletics check?

1986
01:21:18,887 --> 01:21:19,792
MATT: Yes.

1987
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:21,821
LAURA: Does he get an advantage because of
mountains?

1988
01:21:21,821 --> 01:21:23,044
MARISHA: I love that he says 'roll your dice' like
it matters.

1989
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:24,725
MATT: Nope. He gets disadvantage because he's a
big bear.

1990
01:21:24,725 --> 01:21:26,279
TRAVIS: I told her not to say it, why'd you say
it?

1991
01:21:26,279 --> 01:21:27,982
LAURA: I'm just trying to be honest!

1992
01:21:27,982 --> 01:21:29,578
MATT: Which is appreciated.

1993
01:21:29,578 --> 01:21:31,994
LAURA: Strength modifier? He got a 15, too.

1994
01:21:31,994 --> 01:21:35,975
MATT: Okay. It's been difficult, and it slowed
your guys' progression, but you've managed to keep

1995
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:40,646
Trinket along with you; this large bear is now
like pushing against the side. He's managed to

1996
01:21:40,646 --> 01:21:42,730
keep up, but it's been a harrowing experience.

1997
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:44,337
LIAM: I've been behind him the whole time, pushing
on his buttocks.

1998
01:21:44,337 --> 01:21:45,582
MATT: Yeah.

1999
01:21:45,582 --> 01:21:47,230
LAURA: You got this buddy, you got this.

2000
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:48,823
MATT: So, once again, perception rolls.

2001
01:21:48,823 --> 01:21:49,784
LAURA: Sorry. Yes.

2002
01:21:49,784 --> 01:21:50,687
TALIESIN: 20.

2003
01:21:50,687 --> 01:21:51,364
MARISHA: 19.

2004
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:52,470
SAM: 17.

2005
01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:54,018
LIAM: Can I use passive perception?

2006
01:21:54,018 --> 01:21:57,274
MATT: This is active actually looking for
something; the passive is more--

2007
01:21:57,274 --> 01:22:01,087
LIAM: Well then, I get-- 26.

2008
01:22:01,087 --> 01:22:03,456
TRAVIS: 15.

2009
01:22:03,456 --> 01:22:07,571
LAURA: 19.

2010
01:22:07,571 --> 01:22:09,002
MATT: All right. You got 26, you said?

2011
01:22:09,002 --> 01:22:09,664
LIAM: Yep.

2012
01:22:09,664 --> 01:22:15,773
MATT: Looking from this distance, and keeping the
best visual you can see, there is no movement, at

2013
01:22:15,845 --> 01:22:21,388
all, from the interior of the fortress. The two
front doors, you see these two large stone doors

2014
01:22:21,388 --> 01:22:25,269
that are the entrance to it. One of the doors is
actually broken in half and left

2015
01:22:25,269 --> 01:22:27,024
partially ajar and open.

2016
01:22:27,024 --> 01:22:28,253
TRAVIS: We gotta go in now.

2017
01:22:28,253 --> 01:22:28,904
LAURA: No, no, no.

2018
01:22:28,904 --> 01:22:29,948
SAM: They could be dead in there.

2019
01:22:29,948 --> 01:22:34,740
LAURA: If something could've taken out giant
giants. What could it be that could've done that?

2020
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:35,994
TRAVIS: Vampire giants.

2021
01:22:35,994 --> 01:22:38,866
TALIESIN: It could've been the Briarwoods. We
should see everything that's up here.

2022
01:22:38,866 --> 01:22:40,169
SAM: (sings) There are giants in the sky.

2023
01:22:40,169 --> 01:22:41,439
TRAVIS: How awesome would that be?

2024
01:22:41,439 --> 01:22:44,862
LAURA: (sings) There are big, tall, terrible
giants in the sky.

2025
01:22:44,862 --> 01:22:46,786
TRAVIS: Can we please go see? Can someone
please--

2026
01:22:46,786 --> 01:22:48,355
SAM: You want me to go in?

2027
01:22:48,355 --> 01:22:49,157
TRAVIS: Vax!?

2028
01:22:49,157 --> 01:22:50,653
MARISHA: I can bird it. I can bird it and go in.

2029
01:22:50,653 --> 01:22:52,557
TALIESIN: I can't believe I'm about to say this.

2030
01:22:52,557 --> 01:22:54,129
MARISHA: Bird in and do a recon mission real
quick?

2031
01:22:54,129 --> 01:22:55,770
SAM: You're going to bird in? They're going to see
you fly in.

2032
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:56,618
LAURA: No, but she's a bird.

2033
01:22:56,618 --> 01:22:57,413
MARISHA: I'm a bird.

2034
01:22:57,413 --> 01:22:58,538
SAM: It doesn't matter, they're still gonna see
you.

2035
01:22:58,538 --> 01:22:59,404
LAURA: Recon it.

2036
01:22:59,404 --> 01:23:00,587
MARISHA: I'll go bat!

2037
01:23:00,587 --> 01:23:01,749
LAURA: Yeah!

2038
01:23:01,749 --> 01:23:05,715
TALIESIN: Now you're not going to be able to see
anything because they have terrible eyesight.

2039
01:23:05,715 --> 01:23:07,086
MARISHA: Not in a small--

2040
01:23:07,086 --> 01:23:11,145
TALIESIN: I'm kidding, they really don't. That's a
myth! That's actually a myth!

2041
01:23:11,145 --> 01:23:12,308
MARISHA: They have echo vision!

2042
01:23:12,308 --> 01:23:15,130
TALIESIN: They have actually very reasonable
eyesight. That's a myth. You can look it up on

2043
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:16,517
Wikipedia, it's true.

2044
01:23:16,517 --> 01:23:18,220
MARISHA: (laughs) Very reasonable eyesight.

2045
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:19,258
LIAM: You could also be a sparrow.

2046
01:23:19,258 --> 01:23:20,599
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

2047
01:23:20,599 --> 01:23:25,402
MATT: So, at about the two in the afternoon day
sun, 'cause that's what it is. But you're fine.

2048
01:23:25,402 --> 01:23:26,895
You become a bat--

2049
01:23:26,895 --> 01:23:28,050
MARISHA: Bats come out during the day!

2050
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:34,107
MATT: I know. She makes her way, down through; you
swoop up to one of the windows and you glance

2051
01:23:34,107 --> 01:23:40,279
inside and look around. You can see most of the
furniture inside is in tatters. There are large,

2052
01:23:40,279 --> 01:23:44,617
giant-sized tables and chairs that have been
broken in half and strewn across the room.

2053
01:23:44,617 --> 01:23:46,722
Make a perception check.

2054
01:23:46,722 --> 01:23:48,266
LAURA: Ooh, come on, Keyleth!

2055
01:23:48,266 --> 01:23:49,361
SAM: Come on, oh yeah.

2056
01:23:49,361 --> 01:23:50,401
TALIESIN: Oh yeah!

2057
01:23:50,401 --> 01:23:51,442
MARISHA: Oh yeah! 28.

2058
01:23:51,442 --> 01:23:53,515
MATT: 28. Glancing inside you also see there
are--

2059
01:23:53,515 --> 01:23:55,228
MARISHA: (squawks) That's my echovision.

2060
01:23:55,228 --> 01:24:00,467
MATT: -- splatters and puddles of blood. Large
bits of blood across the ground that is dried, but

2061
01:24:00,467 --> 01:24:07,519
from your current vision from this, there is no
sign of any living or individuals or bodies. There

2062
01:24:07,519 --> 01:24:13,090
was a battle that took place here, but there is
nothing present to signify who or what.

2063
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:14,774
MARISHA: How big is this room?

2064
01:24:14,774 --> 01:24:20,074
MATT: This room is about 25 feet tall

2065
01:24:20,074 --> 01:24:21,922
MARISHA: Does it look like it goes deeper?

2066
01:24:21,922 --> 01:24:26,166
MATT: It does look like it goes deeper, there is a
slight-- this is the upper floor, there is a

2067
01:24:26,166 --> 01:24:33,333
grade, almost like a slow-- the word escapes me
for a second.

2068
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:35,455
MARISHA: Like a downgrade.

2069
01:24:35,455 --> 01:24:36,106
MATT: Yes.

2070
01:24:36,106 --> 01:24:36,928
TALIESIN: Like a ramp.

2071
01:24:36,928 --> 01:24:37,497
MATT: A ramp!

2072
01:24:37,497 --> 01:24:38,109
SAM: A slope.

2073
01:24:38,109 --> 01:24:38,854
MATT: Thank you.

2074
01:24:38,854 --> 01:24:43,220
MATT: A ramp that disappears below and into the
lower floor.

2075
01:24:43,532 --> 01:24:44,606
SAM: A siggle.

2076
01:24:44,606 --> 01:24:45,747
MARISHA: I'm gonna go into that--

2077
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:46,978
(all laugh)

2078
01:24:46,978 --> 01:24:48,756
TRAVIS: Careful. Oh no no no no! Don't roll! Don't
roll!

2079
01:24:48,756 --> 01:24:52,777
(all shout)

2080
01:24:52,777 --> 01:24:53,986
TALIESIN: We turn on him.

2081
01:24:53,986 --> 01:24:55,535
MARISHA: Fear of god.

2082
01:24:55,535 --> 01:24:57,623
LIAM: Grog sacrifices the gnome.

2083
01:24:57,623 --> 01:25:03,986
(all laugh)

2084
01:25:03,986 --> 01:25:07,768
MATT: So yeah, you do see the ramp, that's
downward.

2085
01:25:07,768 --> 01:25:10,897
MARISHA: I'm going to go into the room that I see
is for sure empty, and go

2086
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:13,149
toward the threshold of the ramp.

2087
01:25:13,149 --> 01:25:17,907
MATT: Okay. Make your way down to the threshold of
the ramp, looking down. Downstairs as well, it

2088
01:25:17,907 --> 01:25:22,524
looks like there are some fur rugs set aside that
have been kicked aside and bunched up on the edge

2089
01:25:22,524 --> 01:25:23,970
of the room.

2090
01:25:23,970 --> 01:25:27,128
MARISHA: Like it's been ransacked, or just a
really nasty fight?

2091
01:25:27,128 --> 01:25:32,494
MATT: Like some sort of a major fight went down.
No sign of any bodies or body parts. No sign of

2092
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:38,710
leftover weapons or armor from whatever giants
lived in here. You just see large amounts of dried

2093
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:42,695
blood across the stone floors.

2094
01:25:42,695 --> 01:25:49,194
MARISHA: Like something came in and slaughtered
and completely stripped the place.

2095
01:25:49,194 --> 01:25:52,653
MATT: Or the giants slaughtered something horribly
here and are currently out and about, you don't

2096
01:25:52,653 --> 01:25:54,094
know. But--

2097
01:25:54,094 --> 01:25:58,878
MARISHA: Can I tell if the blood looks-- how dusty
is this shit?

2098
01:25:58,878 --> 01:26:01,406
MATT: Did you want to land and make an
investigation check?

2099
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:02,160
SAM: Call us in.

2100
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:02,817
TRAVIS: Do it.

2101
01:26:02,817 --> 01:26:04,183
LIAM: Do it, Batwoman.

2102
01:26:04,183 --> 01:26:06,334
TALIESIN: You are the night.

2103
01:26:06,334 --> 01:26:07,909
MARISHA: How much dust goes pff?

2104
01:26:07,909 --> 01:26:09,130
TRAVIS: (laughs) You are the night.

2105
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:11,350
MATT: Quite a bit; a little puff.

2106
01:26:11,350 --> 01:26:12,490
LAURA: Oh.

2107
01:26:12,490 --> 01:26:17,058
MATT: Not a huge amount, but enough where it's not
fresh, and a closer look, the blood's been dry for

2108
01:26:17,058 --> 01:26:19,111
a while. Make an investigation check.

2109
01:26:19,111 --> 01:26:20,836
TALIESIN: What is the sound of a bat coughing?

2110
01:26:20,836 --> 01:26:22,122
MARISHA: (squawking and coughing noise)

2111
01:26:22,122 --> 01:26:26,138
TALIESIN: Thank you. It's the simple things.

2112
01:26:26,138 --> 01:26:27,146
TRAVIS: What did you get?

2113
01:26:27,146 --> 01:26:29,751
MARISHA: Investigation. What about a 12?

2114
01:26:29,751 --> 01:26:35,560
MATT: 12. You can't really make it out,
unfortunately. You know it's dried, it's been a

2115
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:38,814
little bit, but you can't quite gauge how long
it's been.

2116
01:26:38,814 --> 01:26:44,993
MARISHA: All right, I'm gonna go ahead and-- are
there any other rooms, or is this it?

2117
01:26:44,993 --> 01:26:48,722
MATT: There's the upper floor, the lower floor.
They're two large rooms on their own. It looks

2118
01:26:48,722 --> 01:26:52,619
like-- You haven't actually gone down the grade
yet, so.

2119
01:26:52,812 --> 01:26:57,689
MARISHA: You said seven stories, so it's like
room, downgrade, room, downgrade, room?

2120
01:26:57,689 --> 01:27:01,526
MATT: Seven stories for your size, it's two
stories for a giant size. It's a large top room,

2121
01:27:01,526 --> 01:27:02,673
and a large bottom room.

2122
01:27:02,673 --> 01:27:03,485
LAURA: Ooh.

2123
01:27:03,485 --> 01:27:05,724
MARISHA: Is there another room going off the
bottom room?

2124
01:27:05,724 --> 01:27:09,468
MATT: There are just two rooms: top floor, bottom
floor. You're currently

2125
01:27:09,468 --> 01:27:11,216
on the top floor, looking down.

2126
01:27:11,216 --> 01:27:12,474
SAM: Split level condo.

2127
01:27:12,474 --> 01:27:14,520
MARISH: I'm gonna go out to the front door.

2128
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:15,207
MATT: Okay.

2129
01:27:15,207 --> 01:27:24,929
MARISHA: Nice flat, upper east side. Land, and I'm
gonna bamf out of my bat form, and say, all right,

2130
01:27:24,929 --> 01:27:26,843
it looks like the coast is clear if you guys want
to check this place out.

2131
01:27:26,843 --> 01:27:27,789
SAM: Yeah, let's go check in.

2132
01:27:27,789 --> 01:27:28,629
TALIESIN: Let's check it out.

2133
01:27:28,629 --> 01:27:31,845
MATT: All right, the rest of you make you way back
down towards the front of the fortress and enter

2134
01:27:31,845 --> 01:27:35,795
the inside. As you go through the front door, you
see that the impact that

2135
01:27:35,795 --> 01:27:37,883
destroyed it was from the inside out.

2136
01:27:37,883 --> 01:27:38,613
SAM: Oh!

2137
01:27:38,613 --> 01:27:39,475
LAURA: Ooh.

2138
01:27:39,475 --> 01:27:40,213
TRAVIS: Really?

2139
01:27:40,213 --> 01:27:43,217
MATT: So it's not like it was beaten in, it was
beaten from the inside out.

2140
01:27:43,217 --> 01:27:44,544
LAURA: Oh.

2141
01:27:44,544 --> 01:27:49,364
MATT: And there is a streak of dried blood against
that portion of the door. Looking inside too, you

2142
01:27:49,364 --> 01:27:57,388
see there are a large cluster of matted hides and
furs, like it made for bedding for close to four

2143
01:27:57,388 --> 01:28:03,342
or five giants put in the corner, and there is a
musty smell of whatever they were using to make it

2144
01:28:03,342 --> 01:28:08,433
comfortable and ripe for their own personal
needs.

2145
01:28:08,433 --> 01:28:09,723
LIAM: Stealth!

2146
01:28:09,723 --> 01:28:11,989
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, let's stealth.

2147
01:28:11,989 --> 01:28:13,501
TRAVIS: Can giants become vampires?

2148
01:28:13,501 --> 01:28:18,661
LAURA: I don't know, I hope not. You should use
the dust of tracelessness, Grog, just so our

2149
01:28:18,661 --> 01:28:19,509
footsteps aren't seen.

2150
01:28:19,509 --> 01:28:20,469
LIAM: 17.

2151
01:28:20,469 --> 01:28:21,975
MATT: 17, okay. So what do you guys want to do in
here?

2152
01:28:21,975 --> 01:28:22,894
LAURA: Stealth.

2153
01:28:22,894 --> 01:28:23,772
SAM: I'm going to go downstairs.

2154
01:28:23,772 --> 01:28:25,253
MARISHA: How dark is it?

2155
01:28:25,253 --> 01:28:26,328
MATT: You are downstairs at the entrance

2156
01:28:26,328 --> 01:28:27,767
SAM: Oh. Down the grade, I mean.

2157
01:28:27,767 --> 01:28:31,569
TRAVIS: I want to look for any weapons that are
lying about.

2158
01:28:31,808 --> 01:28:33,840
MATT: All right, make a perception check.

2159
01:28:33,921 --> 01:28:34,863
LIAM: I want to ransack the joint.

2160
01:28:34,863 --> 01:28:36,506
MATT: Actually, it'd be more of an investigation
check.

2161
01:28:36,506 --> 01:28:38,319
TRAVIS: Me, investigate? That's funny. Eight.

2162
01:28:38,319 --> 01:28:39,267
MATT: Okay.

2163
01:28:39,267 --> 01:28:41,243
LIAM: Investigate or perception for me?

2164
01:28:41,243 --> 01:28:42,342
TRAVIS: I find dirt.

2165
01:28:42,342 --> 01:28:44,374
MATT: You find a giant's fortress.

2166
01:28:44,374 --> 01:28:47,132
LIAM: Investigate or perception?

2167
01:28:47,132 --> 01:28:51,728
MATT: For this? Perception is just seeing things
at first glance. Investigation is going through

2168
01:28:51,728 --> 01:28:53,567
and rummaging through to find things.

2169
01:28:53,567 --> 01:28:54,519
LIAM: I'll investigate.

2170
01:28:54,519 --> 01:28:55,508
MATT: Okay.

2171
01:28:55,508 --> 01:28:57,615
SAM: Shall I for downstairs?

2172
01:28:57,615 --> 01:28:59,081
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

2173
01:28:59,081 --> 01:29:02,245
LIAM: 17.

2174
01:29:02,245 --> 01:29:03,576
SAM: 23.

2175
01:29:03,576 --> 01:29:09,761
MATT: Okay. As you guys are going through, looking
at the blood and the way the splashes are, the

2176
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:14,245
blood that was spilled here was very thick, and
large amounts of it, and it's probably been

2177
01:29:14,245 --> 01:29:20,614
anywhere from two to three months since this
entire fortress was ransacked.

2178
01:29:20,614 --> 01:29:21,784
TRAVIS: Wow.

2179
01:29:21,784 --> 01:29:26,550
MATT You do notice that some of the blood is
dragged through, like something was dragged

2180
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:33,789
out of the puddle. But not for a long
distance. Whatever was there was cleaned off at

2181
01:29:34,043 --> 01:29:37,123
some point, or lifted up and carried out from
whatever was originally pulled through those

2182
01:29:37,123 --> 01:29:46,377
puddles of blood. You also do notice that in the
pile of furs and refuse and there are bones of

2183
01:29:46,377 --> 01:29:53,826
things that were left there to rot in the corner.
You find roughly 120 gold pieces.

2184
01:29:53,826 --> 01:29:55,498
SAM: I give it to Vex.

2185
01:29:55,498 --> 01:29:58,796
MATT: Over time you find a number of shattered
glass vials that look like they once contained

2186
01:29:58,796 --> 01:30:02,256
various elixirs, there is one that is unshattered.

2187
01:30:02,256 --> 01:30:03,775
SAM: I take it.

2188
01:30:03,829 --> 01:30:10,612
MATT: All right. And underneath all, covered in
quite a bit of filth, but a little bit of metallic

2189
01:30:10,612 --> 01:30:15,954
sheen streaks through, you see what looks to be
a very, very well-crafted longbow.

2190
01:30:16,133 --> 01:30:19,828
LAURA: (gasps) What is that?! What is it? What did
you find?

2191
01:30:19,828 --> 01:30:20,607
SAM: Nothing, nothing.

2192
01:30:20,607 --> 01:30:21,942
LAURA: What is it? What is that?

2193
01:30:21,942 --> 01:30:23,094
LIAM: Here you go

2194
01:30:23,094 --> 01:30:24,201
LAURA: Ah, what is this?

2195
01:30:24,201 --> 01:30:25,306
LIAM: What are you going to do with it?

2196
01:30:25,306 --> 01:30:25,944
LAURA: What is this?

2197
01:30:25,944 --> 01:30:27,252
SAM: I'll use it as a hammock.

2198
01:30:27,252 --> 01:30:28,472
LIAM: Shoot yourself?

2199
01:30:28,472 --> 01:30:29,872
MARISHA: Does it look like it's magic-y?

2200
01:30:29,872 --> 01:30:31,266
LAURA: Can I tell what it is?

2201
01:30:31,266 --> 01:30:39,284
MATT: Taking it, it appears to have some sort of
magical radiance to it. It looks like it's very

2202
01:30:39,342 --> 01:30:43,513
well crafted. You recognize the construction is
elvish in nature.

2203
01:30:43,513 --> 01:30:45,803
LAURA: Hey, look at this.

2204
01:30:45,803 --> 01:30:51,074
MATT: And there are bits of mithril scrolling all
throughout the bow itself, with platinum caps on

2205
01:30:51,074 --> 01:30:52,684
the edge of the longbow.

2206
01:30:52,684 --> 01:30:54,291
TRAVIS: Is it evil?

2207
01:30:54,291 --> 01:30:58,361
LAURA: I don't know. Keyleth, do you know anything
about magic-y stuff? Tiberius bamfed out.

2208
01:30:58,361 --> 01:31:02,516
MARISHA: I can try, I'm not as good as he is, but
I'll try.

2209
01:31:02,516 --> 01:31:04,336
LAURA: What about you, Scanlan? Do you know
anything about arcana?

2210
01:31:04,336 --> 01:31:05,719
MARISHA: Ooh, 20!

2211
01:31:05,719 --> 01:31:06,809
MATT: Natural 20?

2212
01:31:06,809 --> 01:31:08,547
MARISHA: No, 18; 20 total.

2213
01:31:08,547 --> 01:31:15,329
MATT: Yes, this is definitively a magical item, it
is enchanted.

2214
01:31:15,329 --> 01:31:17,127
MARISHA: It's definitely magical.

2215
01:31:17,127 --> 01:31:20,732
MATT: If you want to take a short time to work
with it and attune yourself to it, you could get a

2216
01:31:20,732 --> 01:31:22,529
better idea of what its effect is.

2217
01:31:22,529 --> 01:31:24,199
LAURA: Okay. Thank you. Can we do that?

2218
01:31:24,199 --> 01:31:25,786
TALIESIN: I'm going to look around a bit more,
anyway.

2219
01:31:25,786 --> 01:31:28,077
LAURA: I'm going to think about it real hard.

2220
01:31:28,077 --> 01:31:29,980
LIAM: Probably shoot a couple dummy arrows out of
it

2221
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:31,200
TRAVIS: Can I walk out the front door?

2222
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,636
LAURA: I'm going to buy it a steak and I'm going
to--

2223
01:31:33,636 --> 01:31:38,144
TRAVIS: Can I walk out the front door and keep
post on the porch?

2224
01:31:38,144 --> 01:31:40,087
LIAM: I'm following Grog and I'm doing the same.

2225
01:31:40,087 --> 01:31:40,810
MATT: All right.

2226
01:31:40,810 --> 01:31:42,534
TRAVIS: And I want to look in the direction we
want to be walking.

2227
01:31:42,534 --> 01:31:44,957
TALIESIN: I'm looking around, I'm trying to find
out what happened to the bodies.

2228
01:31:44,957 --> 01:31:48,710
MATT: Investigation check for that.

2229
01:31:48,773 --> 01:31:52,959
Here are the potion and the bow you guys
managed to--

2230
01:31:52,959 --> 01:31:53,895
LAURA: What is it, what is it?

2231
01:31:53,895 --> 01:31:55,326
SAM: I took the potion, I took the potion!

2232
01:31:55,326 --> 01:31:57,124
MATT: (laughs) Give that to Scanlan.

2233
01:31:57,124 --> 01:32:03,064
TALIESIN: I know, apparently, from this roll that
I'm in the mountains.

2234
01:32:03,064 --> 01:32:04,182
LAURA: What is it?

2235
01:32:04,182 --> 01:32:05,507
TALIESIN: I got a six.

2236
01:32:05,507 --> 01:32:13,034
MATT: A six. It's hard to tell. It's a very
strange scene, and you have no inclination as to

2237
01:32:13,034 --> 01:32:16,894
what may have transpired here. Who is the winner,
who is the loser, and

2238
01:32:16,894 --> 01:32:19,644
what has been done with the bodies.

2239
01:32:19,644 --> 01:32:20,694
LIAM: Sorry.

2240
01:32:20,694 --> 01:32:21,820
MARISHA: What did you find, what did you find?

2241
01:32:21,820 --> 01:32:22,882
TALIESIN: Vex is making happy noises.

2242
01:32:22,882 --> 01:32:25,883
LIAM: She's taking the bow for a spin.

2243
01:32:25,883 --> 01:32:26,883
TRAVIS: She's attuning.

2244
01:32:26,883 --> 01:32:28,434
LIAM: Seeing what it can do.

2245
01:32:28,434 --> 01:32:29,991
TRAVIS: Do we see anything outside on the porch?

2246
01:32:29,991 --> 01:32:37,312
MATT: Over time the only thing you catch is occasionally
you see flocks of birds moving through and

2247
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:49,470
swooping through the area. You watch one flock
come up and begin circling a little bit.

2248
01:32:50,059 --> 01:32:51,384
LAURA: Should we get out? Should we leave?

2249
01:32:51,384 --> 01:32:52,180
MATT: And then make its way down toward the
valley.

2250
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:52,903
TRAVIS: Stealth.

2251
01:32:52,903 --> 01:32:55,006
LAURA: Just leave. Let's leave. Stealth it out?
Stealthy out-ie?

2252
01:32:55,006 --> 01:32:57,208
MATT: This is for Grog who is outside, roll a
stealth check.

2253
01:32:57,208 --> 01:32:59,751
LIAM: I'm out there too, and I rolled a natural
20.

2254
01:32:59,751 --> 01:33:01,318
MATT: Yes you did.

2255
01:33:01,318 --> 01:33:03,396
TRAVIS: I might use your inspiration on this.

2256
01:33:03,396 --> 01:33:05,876
SAM: It's probably not in effect anymore.

2257
01:33:05,876 --> 01:33:07,488
LAURA: (groans) No, you're in the mountains!

2258
01:33:07,488 --> 01:33:09,006
TRAVIS: I am in the mountains.

2259
01:33:09,006 --> 01:33:11,882
MATT: Which means you have knowledge of
mountains.

2260
01:33:11,882 --> 01:33:12,739
LAURA: You don't get advantage?

2261
01:33:12,739 --> 01:33:13,945
TRAVIS: I don't have advantage on--

2262
01:33:13,945 --> 01:33:19,986
MATT: Let me double-check on this, actually, what
the specifics of the goliath's-- You don't take

2263
01:33:19,986 --> 01:33:25,312
issues with cold climates, because you're at high
elevation. You don't actually get advantage on

2264
01:33:25,312 --> 01:33:27,059
anything mountain-wise; that is a ranger ability.

2265
01:33:27,059 --> 01:33:29,696
TRAVIS: So can I add an inspiration on this?

2266
01:33:29,696 --> 01:33:32,623
SAM: I inspired him quite a while ago. How long
does that--

2267
01:33:32,623 --> 01:33:34,252
MATT: It's been a while, how long does that last?

2268
01:33:34,252 --> 01:33:35,292
SAM: 20 minutes?

2269
01:33:35,292 --> 01:33:36,404
MATT: Yeah, that would've faded by now.

2270
01:33:36,404 --> 01:33:37,385
TRAVIS: That's a one.

2271
01:33:37,385 --> 01:33:38,754
MATT: Oh, well, if it's a natural one it wouldn't
have mattered.

2272
01:33:38,754 --> 01:33:40,663
LIAM: Yeah, it doesn't matter, you can't add shit
to one.

2273
01:33:40,663 --> 01:33:45,707
MATT: So while you sneak off to the side, you see
these birds. There's a lot of birds there! You

2274
01:33:45,707 --> 01:33:48,352
start yelling out to everyone, there's a lot of
birds out here!

2275
01:33:48,352 --> 01:33:50,068
Shouting it loudly back into the fortress.

2276
01:33:50,068 --> 01:33:51,061
LAURA: Aw, shit.

2277
01:33:51,061 --> 01:33:55,122
MARISHA: Grog, Grog, those might be centurion
birds!

2278
01:33:55,122 --> 01:33:57,278
TRAVIS: (loudly) That's what I said, birds!

2279
01:33:57,278 --> 01:33:59,556
MARISHA: They might be spies! They might be
spies.

2280
01:33:59,556 --> 01:34:04,017
TRAVIS: (loudly) Yeah, I spy birds, they're flying
everywhere. (yells) Go away!

2281
01:34:04,017 --> 01:34:05,244
LAURA: Grog, Grog, inside.

2282
01:34:05,244 --> 01:34:06,531
MARISHA: Inside!

2283
01:34:06,531 --> 01:34:10,410
MATT: The birds immediately start circling the
fortress very close. You can hear the screeching.

2284
01:34:10,410 --> 01:34:15,893
You can see the birds now, they're crows. A very,
very thick murder of crows, probably close to a

2285
01:34:15,893 --> 01:34:17,232
hundred of them, cawing.

2286
01:34:17,232 --> 01:34:19,181
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace.

2287
01:34:19,181 --> 01:34:20,850
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait.

2288
01:34:20,850 --> 01:34:24,482
SAM: I'm still down there, investigating.

2289
01:34:24,482 --> 01:34:25,678
MATT: Mm-hm.

2290
01:34:25,678 --> 01:34:31,368
SAM: I pull a David Caruso and say, It looks like
these giants had... big trouble.

2291
01:34:31,368 --> 01:34:35,148
(all laugh)

2292
01:34:35,148 --> 01:34:42,556
MATT: You hear an echoing sound, yeahhhh!
Formless, sourceless. You all stand there confused

2293
01:34:42,556 --> 01:34:44,333
for a moment, then continue to try and stealth.

2294
01:34:44,333 --> 01:34:45,400
TRAVIS: I run back inside.

2295
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:51,996
MATT: Back inside. Eventually the crows take back
to their original path.

2296
01:34:51,996 --> 01:34:56,592
MARISHA: Oh, oh, but before the crows leave,
before the crows leave--

2297
01:34:56,592 --> 01:34:57,259
LIAM: Yeah?

2298
01:34:57,259 --> 01:34:57,878
LAURA: Yeah?

2299
01:34:57,878 --> 01:34:58,702
MARISHA: Can I do something?

2300
01:34:58,702 --> 01:34:59,300
MATT: Yep. What are you doing?

2301
01:34:59,300 --> 01:34:59,788
LAURA: Do it!

2302
01:34:59,788 --> 01:35:00,457
TRAVIS: Do it!

2303
01:35:00,457 --> 01:35:01,554
SAM: Kill them all.

2304
01:35:01,739 --> 01:35:06,123
MARISHA: I'm gonna go like Storm and I'm gonna
Sleet Storm them. I'm gonna start conjuring a

2305
01:35:06,123 --> 01:35:08,582
Sleet Storm over the top of this mountain, right
where the crows are.

2306
01:35:08,582 --> 01:35:11,063
TALIESIN: It's been so long since you've killed
something innocent! Let's bring it!

2307
01:35:11,063 --> 01:35:12,493
LAURA: Do it, do it, Keyleth!

2308
01:35:12,493 --> 01:35:15,748
MATT: As Keyleth concentrates for a second, you
see her eyes, the actual color of her irises,

2309
01:35:15,748 --> 01:35:21,129
begin to fade to this cloudy white and then the
entire eye itself becomes this icy blue. A slight

2310
01:35:21,189 --> 01:35:26,672
cold mist beginning to drift off the corners of
her face.

2311
01:35:26,672 --> 01:35:27,756
LAURA: Badass.

2312
01:35:27,756 --> 01:35:31,791
MATT: You start hearing this pounding sound on the
top of the fortress as sleet and hail begins to

2313
01:35:31,791 --> 01:35:36,218
rain down. Go ahead and roll damage for the
spell.

2314
01:35:37,836 --> 01:35:40,700
MARISHA: Oh, jeez.

2315
01:35:43,826 --> 01:35:57,371
MATT: Sleet Storm? Oh, it's just a dexterity
saving throw. It says heavily obscured, but

2316
01:35:57,371 --> 01:35:59,970
doesn't actually do any damage.

2317
01:35:59,970 --> 01:36:01,535
LAURA: But it knocks them all down.

2318
01:36:01,535 --> 01:36:04,897
MARISHA: I know, they're like frozen though,
right? Don't they get frozen with Sleet Storm?

2319
01:36:04,897 --> 01:36:09,890
MATT: Sleet Storm knocks things prone, makes the
area hard to see.

2320
01:36:10,070 --> 01:36:11,026
MARISHA: Knocks them prone

2321
01:36:11,026 --> 01:36:11,966
MATT: Douses flames.

2322
01:36:11,966 --> 01:36:15,067
MARISHA: They're in the sky, I wanna hear birds
hit the floor.

2323
01:36:15,067 --> 01:36:18,875
MATT: And a few do. There are a few birds that get
pelted and knocked to the ground, encased in

2324
01:36:18,875 --> 01:36:23,109
sleet, but most of it immediately takes note to
get away from the storm and vanish

2325
01:36:23,109 --> 01:36:24,596
and disappear back to--

2326
01:36:24,596 --> 01:36:26,343
TRAVIS: Do they fall to the porch?

2327
01:36:26,343 --> 01:36:27,628
MATT: I'll say one does.

2328
01:36:27,628 --> 01:36:28,793
TRAVIS: I run out there and I grab it.

2329
01:36:28,793 --> 01:36:30,991
LAURA: No, no, no!

2330
01:36:30,991 --> 01:36:32,445
TRAVIS: I rip its head off with my teeth.

2331
01:36:32,445 --> 01:36:34,687
(all laugh)

2332
01:36:34,687 --> 01:36:37,997
MATT: Grog, you run out there and grab the one on
the ground, it's struggling, and (squawks),

2333
01:36:37,997 --> 01:36:39,075
there's ice gathered everywhere.

2334
01:36:39,075 --> 01:36:40,175
TRAVIS: Yeah, shut up!

2335
01:36:40,175 --> 01:36:47,445
MATT: You grab it and you pick it up, you hear Vex
go "Grog!" and you go (chomp) as she's staring at

2336
01:36:47,445 --> 01:37:00,225
you. Silencing the crow. You hear the cawing of
the crows dissipate in the distance and silence

2337
01:37:00,342 --> 01:37:03,654
eventually takes the fortress once again, and
you're left amongst the smell of death.

2338
01:37:03,654 --> 01:37:04,826
LAURA: We should get the eff out of here.

2339
01:37:04,826 --> 01:37:05,539
MARISHA: I think so.

2340
01:37:05,539 --> 01:37:06,367
TALIESIN: We should probably leave.

2341
01:37:06,367 --> 01:37:07,931
LAURA: Now. Stealth and out.

2342
01:37:07,931 --> 01:37:11,216
LAURA: Dust of tracelessness. Hide ourselves.

2343
01:37:11,216 --> 01:37:12,596
TRAVIS: Dust of tracelessness.

2344
01:37:12,596 --> 01:37:19,252
MATT: You make your way out of the fortress and
begin to follow the path down into the outside of

2345
01:37:19,252 --> 01:37:26,782
the forest and just as you make towards the base
of the mountains where the forest canopy begins to

2346
01:37:26,782 --> 01:37:34,590
take your vision, you can see just over the edge,
a couple of small castle towers and what looks to

2347
01:37:34,590 --> 01:37:37,371
be a single central spire of the castle of
Whitestone.

2348
01:37:37,371 --> 01:37:39,080
LAURA: They know we're here now. They know we're
here.

2349
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:40,598
LIAM: Yeah.

2350
01:37:40,657 --> 01:37:41,683
TALIESIN: I think they might.

2351
01:37:41,683 --> 01:37:42,568
LAURA: That was a sentry.

2352
01:37:42,568 --> 01:37:43,557
TRAVIS: Why? They were just birds.

2353
01:37:43,557 --> 01:37:44,718
MARISHA: Yeah, but we don't know--

2354
01:37:44,718 --> 01:37:51,837
SAM: Don't worry, we still have the element of
surprise. Oh wait, no, we don't.

2355
01:37:51,837 --> 01:37:57,947
MATT: And with that, we're going to go ahead and
take a break. All right, guys, we'll be back here

2356
01:37:57,947 --> 01:38:00,397
in about 20-25 minutes.

2357
01:38:00,397 --> 01:38:02,420
LAURA: Oh yeah!

2358
01:38:02,420 --> 01:38:03,927
MATT: Let us begin where we left off.

2359
01:38:03,927 --> 01:38:07,855
LAURA: Oh, we're looking at the city.

2360
01:38:07,855 --> 01:38:13,797
SAM: There's the city! Shall we storm it?

2361
01:38:13,797 --> 01:38:15,291
TALIESIN: It's a chalkboard.

2362
01:38:15,291 --> 01:38:16,435
LAURA: I was pointing at you!

2363
01:38:16,435 --> 01:38:21,879
TALIESIN: Well yes, so I can now recognize where
we are.

2364
01:38:21,879 --> 01:38:29,859
MATT: Yes, you know this area very well. This
entire forested area, the Parchwood Forest that

2365
01:38:29,859 --> 01:38:36,608
encompases the entirety of this valley, toward the
center of it, center north, is where Whitestone

2366
01:38:36,608 --> 01:38:40,359
sits and for your reference as well, since you've
been here before,

2367
01:38:40,359 --> 01:38:42,713
you would know the city relatively well.

2368
01:38:42,713 --> 01:38:43,747
SAM: Maps!

2369
01:38:43,747 --> 01:38:50,162
TALIESIN: This is the most exciting map I've ever
been handed. Whoa!

2370
01:38:50,162 --> 01:38:54,071
LAURA: What the what?!

2371
01:38:54,071 --> 01:38:56,981
MATT: Hold that over by your seat there for people
to take a look at.

2372
01:38:56,981 --> 01:38:58,707
SAM: Don't. Just don't.

2373
01:38:58,707 --> 01:39:01,872
TALIESIN: It won't fit in my folder.

2374
01:39:01,872 --> 01:39:06,979
MATT: That is a basic rundown of the size, design
and shape of Whitestone, with Castle Whitestone

2375
01:39:06,979 --> 01:39:13,132
toward the top, built on top of a leveled off
mountain that marks the southernmost point.

2376
01:39:13,132 --> 01:39:14,657
SAM: This is the castle, this is the town?

2377
01:39:14,657 --> 01:39:16,338
TRAVIS: And we're at the southern part of that?

2378
01:39:16,338 --> 01:39:22,447
MATT: You guys are actually coming in from what
would be the northwestern side of the city

2379
01:39:22,447 --> 01:39:24,174
MARISHA: So over here?

2380
01:39:24,174 --> 01:39:28,726
MATT: A little bit further down. About that angle
there. That's the direction

2381
01:39:28,726 --> 01:39:30,090
you're coming in from.

2382
01:39:30,090 --> 01:39:32,665
TRAVIS: That's a detailed map, man.

2383
01:39:32,665 --> 01:39:34,218
MATT: I don't have any free time anymore.

2384
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:36,724
(all laugh)

2385
01:39:36,724 --> 01:39:37,932
TRAVIS: They sell those stock, right?

2386
01:39:37,932 --> 01:39:39,048
MATT: Oh yeah, totally.

2387
01:39:39,048 --> 01:39:41,921
TALIESIN: What's this little outcropping?

2388
01:39:41,921 --> 01:39:48,449
MAT: The little outcropping to the east of it was
the graveyard to Whitestone. It's where most of

2389
01:39:48,449 --> 01:39:53,579
the regular denizens were interred. It's been
expanded over the years as the city itself has

2390
01:39:53,579 --> 01:39:56,484
been around for quite a few generations.

2391
01:39:56,484 --> 01:40:02,555
MARISHA: Does this graveyard have catacombs?
Tombs? Underground passages?

2392
01:40:02,555 --> 01:40:05,594
MATT: Do you ask this of Percy?

2393
01:40:05,594 --> 01:40:07,033
MARISHA: Yes.

2394
01:40:07,033 --> 01:40:07,897
TALIESIN: Does it?

2395
01:40:07,897 --> 01:40:09,751
MATT: That graveyard does not--
TALIESIN: That graveyard does not--

2396
01:40:09,751 --> 01:40:12,197
MATT: -- it is a surface graveyard.
TALIESIN: -- it is a surface graveyard.

2397
01:40:12,197 --> 01:40:14,727
MATT: There is a mausoleum--
TALIESIN: There is a mausoleum--

2398
01:40:14,727 --> 01:40:16,229
MATT: -- but that--
TALIESIN: -- but that--

2399
01:40:16,229 --> 01:40:19,291
MATT: -- is actually contained beneath the castle.
TALIESIN: -- is actually contained beneath the castle.

2400
01:40:19,291 --> 01:40:22,293
(all laugh)

2401
01:40:22,293 --> 01:40:23,207
TRAVIS: Riveting.

2402
01:40:23,207 --> 01:40:26,064
SAM: So knowledgeable, Percy.

2403
01:40:26,064 --> 01:40:30,745
LAURA: So Percy, do you know of any secret
passages to get actually into the castle?

2404
01:40:30,745 --> 01:40:32,603
TALIESIN: I was wondering that myself.

2405
01:40:32,603 --> 01:40:34,405
MATT: There is one, one that you took to escape.

2406
01:40:34,405 --> 01:40:35,649
TALIESIN: Yes, there is one!

2407
01:40:35,649 --> 01:40:40,235
MARISHA: (laughs) Stop.

2408
01:40:40,235 --> 01:40:53,595
MATT: He has an aneurysm. Yeah, it is to the very
western edge of the mountain precipice the castle

2409
01:40:53,595 --> 01:40:59,449
was built on. It was built to be specifically an
escape in case the place was under siege.

2410
01:40:59,449 --> 01:41:03,330
Unfortunately, the circumstances that the evening
happened so rapidly, and with creatures that

2411
01:41:03,388 --> 01:41:10,651
seemingly were unnatural, the family didn't have
time to make it out. And even you weren't fully

2412
01:41:10,651 --> 01:41:14,977
aware of it. Cassandra, however, had overheard
discussions about the passage and took that as your

2413
01:41:14,977 --> 01:41:21,319
escape route. It's a hidden tunnel at the very
base of the mountain.

2414
01:41:21,936 --> 01:41:30,244
TALIESIN: I say we scope out the hidden entrance,
see if it's guarded,

2415
01:41:30,244 --> 01:41:32,273
see if they've discovered it.

2416
01:41:32,273 --> 01:41:36,059
SAM: To the town, or to the castle?

2417
01:41:36,059 --> 01:41:41,176
TALIESIN: The hidden entrance to the castle.
Instead of using it, I think we should possibly

2418
01:41:41,176 --> 01:41:46,443
spend the night and get a view of the town, see if
there's anything unusual.

2419
01:41:46,443 --> 01:41:48,516
LAURA: I agree, can we camp out and hide?

2420
01:41:48,516 --> 01:41:51,658
SAM: Watch from afar? What's that going to tell
us?

2421
01:41:51,658 --> 01:41:53,446
TRAVIS: We could send one in.

2422
01:41:53,446 --> 01:41:56,286
TALIESIN: We could send a bird in. Or an invisible
gnome.

2423
01:41:56,286 --> 01:41:58,921
SAM: Or both.

2424
01:41:58,921 --> 01:42:01,985
TALIESIN: Or both. An invisible bird-gnome.

2425
01:42:01,985 --> 01:42:07,025
TRAVIS: Just to see if the town is normal or not.

2426
01:42:07,025 --> 01:42:10,386
SAM: It could be all vampires. Or it could be a
totally normal town.

2427
01:42:10,386 --> 01:42:13,618
TALIESIN: If it's all vampires, it'll be empty
right now.

2428
01:42:13,618 --> 01:42:15,880
SAM and LAURA: Because it's daytime.

2429
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:17,097
MARISHA: We should do a fly-by.

2430
01:42:17,097 --> 01:42:19,154
LAURA: We should definitely attack during the
day.

2431
01:42:19,154 --> 01:42:20,047
TALIESIN: Yes.

2432
01:42:20,047 --> 01:42:21,851
TRAVIS: We should send one by air and one by
land.

2433
01:42:21,851 --> 01:42:23,088
LAURA: What?

2434
01:42:23,088 --> 01:42:24,388
MARISHA: Do you want to do that?

2435
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:25,289
SAM: How far away are we?

2436
01:42:25,289 --> 01:42:28,692
MATT: You guys have been travelling through the
forest, and it is a very dense forest, but it is

2437
01:42:28,692 --> 01:42:38,968
mostly cold-weather trees, pines. And there is,
you can see once you get inside the forest, the

2438
01:42:38,968 --> 01:42:46,850
ground itself is very thick and there are elements
of melting snow on the top of the trees, there was

2439
01:42:46,850 --> 01:42:52,244
recently a snowfall in this area but it seems like
it's been a while and most of it has turned to slush

2440
01:42:52,244 --> 01:43:04,854
and water. You have about two hours of travel into
the forest, and you all immediately catch the

2441
01:43:04,930 --> 01:43:07,595
sound of distant howling.

2442
01:43:11,421 --> 01:43:12,652
SAM: Is it nighttime?

2443
01:43:12,652 --> 01:43:13,919
MATT: No.

2444
01:43:13,919 --> 01:43:15,217
SAM: Oh. That's scary.

2445
01:43:15,217 --> 01:43:18,138
MARISHA: Distant howling? Does it sound like
wolves? Can I make a nature check?

2446
01:43:18,138 --> 01:43:19,909
MATT: Yeah, make a nature check.

2447
01:43:19,909 --> 01:43:21,201
LAURA: Stealth?

2448
01:43:21,201 --> 01:43:23,668
MATT: If you want to make a stealth check

2449
01:43:23,668 --> 01:43:28,273
MARISHA: 26.

2450
01:43:28,273 --> 01:43:33,224
MATT: 26. Those are wolves. It sounds like a pack
of wolves, probably close to

2451
01:43:33,224 --> 01:43:34,828
anywhere from five or six.

2452
01:43:34,828 --> 01:43:38,304
MARISHA: Would I think it's weird that they're
howling during the daytime?

2453
01:43:38,304 --> 01:43:42,418
MATT: You gather that it is strange that they're
out. Though it is getting later in the day, you

2454
01:43:42,418 --> 01:43:50,712
are pushing four or five in the afternoon, the sun
is starting to get closer to the horizon. It is

2455
01:43:50,712 --> 01:43:56,440
strange that they're out this early, you're not
sure what the reasoning would be for that.

2456
01:43:57,502 --> 01:43:58,744
MARISHA: Odd.

2457
01:43:58,744 --> 01:44:00,597
TALIESIN: I say we hide in the trees.

2458
01:44:00,597 --> 01:44:01,343
LAURA: Up high.

2459
01:44:01,343 --> 01:44:02,294
TRAVIS: Like up in the trees?

2460
01:44:02,294 --> 01:44:04,331
LAURA: I like it.

2461
01:44:04,331 --> 01:44:06,388
TRAVIS: We're gonna climb some trees.

2462
01:44:06,388 --> 01:44:07,803
MATT: Okay.

2463
01:44:07,803 --> 01:44:08,887
LIAM: We're gonna Hobbit this shit.

2464
01:44:08,887 --> 01:44:11,251
SAM: We're just hiding in the trees, we're not
going in to investigate?

2465
01:44:11,251 --> 01:44:13,785
TALIESIN: Well, it's about to be nighttime, so
we'll send a scout.

2466
01:44:13,785 --> 01:44:17,256
SAM: How long would it take to get into the town
from where we are?

2467
01:44:17,256 --> 01:44:19,103
MATT: About two more hours of travel.

2468
01:44:19,103 --> 01:44:23,839
SAM: Ew. We'll get there at night. That's all
right though, it's early evening.

2469
01:44:23,839 --> 01:44:26,661
MARISHA: How long would it take me to fly over if
I was a bird?

2470
01:44:26,661 --> 01:44:27,997
MATT: About an hour.

2471
01:44:27,997 --> 01:44:29,295
SAM: Vax.

2472
01:44:29,295 --> 01:44:31,607
LIAM: Yes?

2473
01:44:31,607 --> 01:44:34,762
SAM: Can I ride you into town?

2474
01:44:34,762 --> 01:44:37,161
LIAM: You want me to jog into town?

2475
01:44:37,161 --> 01:44:38,815
MARISHA: You could ride me into town.

2476
01:44:38,815 --> 01:44:40,168
SAM: Well hello lady.

2477
01:44:40,168 --> 01:44:42,833
MARISHA: Man, every time, Scanlan, every time.

2478
01:44:42,833 --> 01:44:44,713
TALIESIN: Now that just got weird.

2479
01:44:44,713 --> 01:44:47,170
LAURA: Could you turn yourself and fly?

2480
01:44:47,170 --> 01:44:48,501
SAM: Yeah, I guess I could fly.

2481
01:44:48,501 --> 01:44:52,121
MARISHA: You wanna go invisible and jump on my
back and I can eagle up?

2482
01:44:52,121 --> 01:44:56,240
SAM: Whatever you're into, baby. (laughs) I've
become Austin Powers.

2483
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:58,321
LAURA: Ridiculous.

2484
01:44:58,321 --> 01:45:00,228
MARISHA: Let's do it.

2485
01:45:00,228 --> 01:45:03,760
LIAM: If the coach driver was any indication,
there are going to be people--

2486
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:04,793
LAURA: Normal people.

2487
01:45:04,793 --> 01:45:05,815
LIAM: -- in town.

2488
01:45:05,815 --> 01:45:08,990
SAM: What about this: I'll make us both invisible
and you fly us in.

2489
01:45:08,990 --> 01:45:10,865
LAURA: I like it.

2490
01:45:10,865 --> 01:45:13,034
TRAVIS: Yeah, get on the ground, not just above.

2491
01:45:13,034 --> 01:45:17,825
MATT: All right. Now, Invisibility: how long does
it last at full duration?

2492
01:45:17,825 --> 01:45:22,365
SAM: Looking. Up to an hour. Ooh, and it takes two
hours just to get there?

2493
01:45:22,365 --> 01:45:26,308
MATT: Well, flying takes an hour. So, it's one of
those things you could do once you approach it.

2494
01:45:26,308 --> 01:45:28,737
It'll last you awhile, as opposed to doing it
now.

2495
01:45:28,737 --> 01:45:32,758
SAM: How long can you be Polymorphed for? Forever?
Concentration?

2496
01:45:32,758 --> 01:45:35,253
MARISHA: For half of my druid level, we
discovered.

2497
01:45:35,253 --> 01:45:38,165
MATT: So somewhere around six hours, five hours.

2498
01:45:38,165 --> 01:45:42,609
SAM: Okay, so you fly us in, and I'll Invisibility
us right as we get to the gates.

2499
01:45:42,609 --> 01:45:44,706
TRAVIS: And as they're going out, we get in the
trees.

2500
01:45:44,706 --> 01:45:46,318
TALIESIN: Make sure you bring an earpiece.

2501
01:45:46,318 --> 01:45:47,544
MARISHA: He's got an earpiece.

2502
01:45:47,544 --> 01:45:49,504
TRAVIS: Do we, the four of us, all go up in the
trees?

2503
01:45:49,504 --> 01:45:50,672
LIAM: Everyone get your own tree.

2504
01:45:50,672 --> 01:45:53,519
LAURA: Everyone get your own tree?

2505
01:45:53,519 --> 01:45:58,066
MATT: Everyone who's in a tree, please roll a
stealth check.

2506
01:45:58,066 --> 01:45:59,363
SAM: Except for Trinket, who can't climb up.

2507
01:45:59,363 --> 01:46:01,110
LAURA: Trinket can climb trees! Bears climb
trees!

2508
01:46:01,110 --> 01:46:03,500
MATT: Roll an athletics check.

2509
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:08,184
LAURA: I'm casting Pass Without a Trace. How long
does it last?

2510
01:46:08,184 --> 01:46:09,905
SAM: You have to roll for Trinket.

2511
01:46:09,905 --> 01:46:12,778
LAURA: Okay, fine! I guess I'll cast it tonight,
never mind.

2512
01:46:12,778 --> 01:46:16,870
TRAVIS: Plus ten to stealth?

2513
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:18,238
LAURA: Why are you being a dick, Scanlan?

2514
01:46:18,238 --> 01:46:19,183
MATT: Well, she did not cast it.

2515
01:46:19,183 --> 01:46:20,425
LAURA: I'm not casting it yet.

2516
01:46:20,425 --> 01:46:21,472
TRAVIS: 14.

2517
01:46:21,472 --> 01:46:22,735
LAURA: What are we rolling?

2518
01:46:22,735 --> 01:46:23,840
TRAVIS: Stealth.

2519
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:31,227
LIAM: I already did. Those are good rolls!

2520
01:46:31,227 --> 01:46:42,063
LAURA: 21 for me, and what do I-- just nothing. 19
for Trinket.

2521
01:46:42,063 --> 01:46:47,308
MATT: Okay. We'll say you guys all manage to
slowly get yourself up into the tree the best you

2522
01:46:47,308 --> 01:46:53,777
can, as you guys take off. While you guys are
away, making your way towards Whitestone, the rest

2523
01:46:53,849 --> 01:46:59,305
of you look down, and just from a passive
perception standpoint, you pick up the most

2524
01:46:59,305 --> 01:47:05,124
detail: you can see there is indeed a pack of
about five wolves and/or dogs a little ways away,

2525
01:47:05,124 --> 01:47:12,776
but they're being followed by one humanoid.
They're being guided, there is a pack out here for

2526
01:47:12,776 --> 01:47:17,721
some reason, whether it be a hunting party or
whatever other reasons there may be.

2527
01:47:17,721 --> 01:47:20,548
It isn't a wild pack.

2528
01:47:20,548 --> 01:47:21,919
LAURA: And they're close to us now?

2529
01:47:21,919 --> 01:47:24,048
TRAVIS: I've been doing the dust of
tracelessness.

2530
01:47:24,048 --> 01:47:26,654
LAURA: So, I'll cast it on us now that they're
closer.

2531
01:47:26,654 --> 01:47:28,666
MARISHA: I wonder if that's the ground search
party.

2532
01:47:28,666 --> 01:47:30,130
LAURA: Maybe.

2533
01:47:30,130 --> 01:47:31,411
TRAVIS: We'll see.

2534
01:47:31,411 --> 01:47:36,101
LAURA: So, should we add ten to all of our stealth
rolls that had been, or do we have to roll again?

2535
01:47:36,101 --> 01:47:37,305
MATT: You'd have to roll again.

2536
01:47:37,305 --> 01:47:38,054
LAURA: Shit balls.

2537
01:47:38,054 --> 01:47:39,354
LIAM: So we're stealthing again in the tree?

2538
01:47:39,354 --> 01:47:41,639
MATT: Because she's casting Pass, or you won't get
the benefit.

2539
01:47:41,639 --> 01:47:45,073
LIAM: I'm already at a 32, man!

2540
01:47:45,073 --> 01:47:46,257
TRAVIS: I'll take it.

2541
01:47:46,257 --> 01:47:47,423
LAURA: You don't have to.

2542
01:47:47,423 --> 01:47:49,302
LIAM: Let's do it, let's roll again.

2543
01:47:49,302 --> 01:47:50,312
TALIESIN: Let's roll again.

2544
01:47:50,312 --> 01:47:51,123
LIAM: What do we add?

2545
01:47:51,123 --> 01:47:52,634
LAURA: Ten to whatever we roll.

2546
01:47:52,634 --> 01:47:54,244
MATT: Go ahead and just add ten to the previous
roll.

2547
01:47:54,244 --> 01:47:55,452
(all cheer)

2548
01:47:55,452 --> 01:47:56,181
LIAM: Good.

2549
01:47:56,181 --> 01:48:00,944
MARISHA: We want to keep our good rolls.

2550
01:48:00,944 --> 01:48:10,676
MATT: So, about five breathless moments pass as
the dogs, wolves all get relatively close. One of

2551
01:48:10,676 --> 01:48:18,735
them comes up and returns back to the pack. You
don't get a good view of the individual that is

2552
01:48:18,735 --> 01:48:23,976
currently guiding the pack, and you see them
disappear between the thick trees in the distance.

2553
01:48:23,976 --> 01:48:31,791
Make an active perception check for you, Vex, if
you don't mind.

2554
01:48:31,791 --> 01:48:34,042
LAURA: Not advantage. Mountains?

2555
01:48:34,042 --> 01:48:36,119
MATT: Is forest? No, you're in forest, now.

2556
01:48:36,119 --> 01:48:42,121
LAURA: Oh wait! That's another!

2557
01:48:42,121 --> 01:48:44,196
MATT: You're sure that's a favored terrain? Then
go ahead and roll again.

2558
01:48:44,196 --> 01:48:48,446
LAURA: That was worse than the first one, that's
great.

2559
01:48:48,446 --> 01:48:49,684
MATT: So your total is?

2560
01:48:49,684 --> 01:48:50,835
LIAM: I rolled 20.

2561
01:48:50,835 --> 01:48:53,051
LAURA: Okay, well, you didn't say you were doing
it. 18.

2562
01:48:53,051 --> 01:48:58,935
MATT: 18, okay. It's hard to make out the details
at this distance. You check out, it does appear to

2563
01:48:58,935 --> 01:49:00,278
be a female form.

2564
01:49:00,278 --> 01:49:01,622
LAURA: Oh, it's a chick!

2565
01:49:01,622 --> 01:49:06,419
MATT: Best you can tell, you can't tell specific
race or details. Then, another minute passes

2566
01:49:06,419 --> 01:49:14,694
before the barking and the howls fade and the
hunting party seems to have been eluded.

2567
01:49:14,694 --> 01:49:18,115
TALIESIN: There was no way to get a good look at
who it was.

2568
01:49:18,115 --> 01:49:20,560
MATT: No. Do you want to make an active perception
check?

2569
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:24,443
TALIESIN: Actually, I would love to.

2570
01:49:24,953 --> 01:49:26,746
MATT: Normally, if they'd passed by now--

2571
01:49:26,746 --> 01:49:27,927
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

2572
01:49:27,927 --> 01:49:28,986
TRAVIS: What?! Really?

2573
01:49:28,986 --> 01:49:30,409
MATT: A natural 20?!

2574
01:49:30,409 --> 01:49:33,765
MARISHA: I'm looking at it!

2575
01:49:33,765 --> 01:49:37,594
TALIESIN: This is an 'I love you' for those awful
rolls earlier.

2576
01:49:37,594 --> 01:49:39,764
TRAVIS: The golden snitch wins again.

2577
01:49:39,764 --> 01:49:42,687
TALIESIN: That may be its name now.

2578
01:49:42,687 --> 01:49:54,978
MATT: You see the female form, it's not someone
you particularly recognize. But the woman does

2579
01:49:55,050 --> 01:50:05,523
appear to be older, probably in her late 40s,
early 50s. She has some hunting gear over her

2580
01:50:05,523 --> 01:50:12,638
shoulder. She has a short bow that's strapped over
her, she has a quiver of arrows. She

2581
01:50:12,695 --> 01:50:16,431
looks like she's hunting for food.

2582
01:50:17,474 --> 01:50:20,732
SAM: If she was a little older, Tiberius would
kill her.

2583
01:50:20,732 --> 01:50:23,660
(all laugh)

2584
01:50:23,660 --> 01:50:24,815
SAM: Give her ten years.

2585
01:50:24,815 --> 01:50:25,929
MATT: Give her ten years.

2586
01:50:25,929 --> 01:50:27,411
TALIESIN: I don't recognize her, though?

2587
01:50:27,411 --> 01:50:38,241
MATT: No, you don't have an immediate lead of
visual recognition. In the meantime, you guys make

2588
01:50:38,302 --> 01:50:46,818
your way. Swooping down, you can see that cluster,
that murder of crows circling out. It's making a

2589
01:50:46,818 --> 01:50:54,156
large pass over this entire valley. You take this
cue as you get to within visual range of the city

2590
01:50:54,156 --> 01:50:56,479
to cast Invisibility on both of you. Is that a
3rd-level spell?

2591
01:50:56,540 --> 01:50:57,502
SAM: Yes.

2592
01:50:57,502 --> 01:51:02,272
MATT: Okay. Both of you vanish from view, which is
a strange feeling for you because you cannot see

2593
01:51:02,272 --> 01:51:04,274
Keyleth, you're grasping onto something you can't
see.

2594
01:51:04,274 --> 01:51:05,475
SAM: Oh, shit.

2595
01:51:05,475 --> 01:51:07,171
MATT: And you just look like you're gliding
through the air.

2596
01:51:07,171 --> 01:51:08,972
SAM: Can I do one of these?

2597
01:51:08,972 --> 01:51:10,489
MATT: Yeah, you grab on very tightly.

2598
01:51:10,489 --> 01:51:11,278
MARISHA: (choking noises)

2599
01:51:11,278 --> 01:51:13,281
MATT: -- without choking. The eagle does not
have--

2600
01:51:13,281 --> 01:51:14,305
SAM: Damn it!

2601
01:51:14,305 --> 01:51:20,946
MATT: -- human physiology. You get two fistfuls of
feathers. And you really don't want an eagle to

2602
01:51:20,946 --> 01:51:27,517
buck you angrily at this height. I don't think you
have Featherfall so that wouldn't go well. Looking

2603
01:51:27,517 --> 01:51:33,416
over Whitestone, you can see outside of the city
there are some areas where the trees are

2604
01:51:33,416 --> 01:51:39,424
carved out, and there is farmland set up
specifically to grow food and to till to maintain

2605
01:51:39,482 --> 01:51:45,355
sustenance for the people that live there. You can
see that there's a small area that's also being

2606
01:51:45,355 --> 01:51:51,829
cut for timber. Not a perpetual thing, but the
wood here is, you've heard previously, one of

2607
01:51:51,829 --> 01:51:57,920
the major exports here is very high-quality timber
from this type of tree that is used for very

2608
01:51:58,052 --> 01:52:04,377
exquisite woodcraft and furniture. So that's one
of the major exports of Whitestone as well as the

2609
01:52:04,377 --> 01:52:13,017
quartz from the mines itself. There are people in
the city, but sparse. Make a perception check.

2610
01:52:14,566 --> 01:52:16,093
MARISHA: Can I also make a perception check?

2611
01:52:16,093 --> 01:52:16,784
MATT: You may.

2612
01:52:16,784 --> 01:52:17,726
MARISHA: With my eagle vision?

2613
01:52:17,726 --> 01:52:19,640
MATT: (singsong) You may.

2614
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:27,023
MARISHA: 14, so that's 24. And I have Keen Sight,
which means

2615
01:52:27,023 --> 01:52:29,251
I have advantage on all perception checks.

2616
01:52:29,251 --> 01:52:30,622
MATT: Yes, you do.

2617
01:52:30,622 --> 01:52:31,652
MARISHA: I'll take that 14.

2618
01:52:31,652 --> 01:52:32,711
TALIESIN: She'll take that 14.

2619
01:52:32,711 --> 01:52:33,887
MARISHA: As opposed to that one.

2620
01:52:33,887 --> 01:52:34,547
MATT: Total of 14?

2621
01:52:34,547 --> 01:52:35,363
MARISHA: 24.

2622
01:52:35,363 --> 01:52:43,739
MATT: 24. Okay. As you get close enough to start
scanning over details, you can see that a lot of

2623
01:52:43,739 --> 01:52:52,469
the buildings appear to be closed or empty. There
are people working in the fields. As you make your

2624
01:52:52,469 --> 01:52:57,190
way to the center of the town, there is a town
square. There is a tree there, a very large, old

2625
01:52:57,190 --> 01:53:03,160
tree that is twisted, with all these various
gnarled branches that reach out. You recall

2626
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:09,556
Desmond mentioning something called the Sun Tree
that is the centerpiece of this area. And you get

2627
01:53:09,556 --> 01:53:15,390
a view enough of the tree to see that there are
eight humanoid bodies

2628
01:53:15,390 --> 01:53:17,725
of varying ages swinging from it.

2629
01:53:17,725 --> 01:53:18,500
SAM: Ooh.

2630
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:20,386
LAURA: Oh no.

2631
01:53:20,386 --> 01:53:33,856
MATT: You also notice that, patrolling through the
city at very slow paces, there are a few larger

2632
01:53:33,856 --> 01:53:35,689
than normal humanoids.

2633
01:53:35,689 --> 01:53:36,935
LAURA: (gasps)

2634
01:53:36,935 --> 01:53:43,631
MATT: You see what appear to be approximately six
giants patrolling through the town, but you can

2635
01:53:43,631 --> 01:53:48,033
see some of them are like wrecked and broken. One
of them is missing an arm and

2636
01:53:48,033 --> 01:53:50,398
is dragging a foot behind it.

2637
01:53:50,398 --> 01:53:52,720
LAURA: They're zombie giants?!

2638
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:55,832
MATT: Apparently, whenever one of them is moving
through, most of the denizens of the town keep a

2639
01:53:55,832 --> 01:53:59,822
very wide berth, and generally avoid them entirely
and go about their business, at a distance.

2640
01:53:59,822 --> 01:54:01,390
LAURA: Oh my god.

2641
01:54:01,390 --> 01:54:04,904
LIAM: I miss Pike.

2642
01:54:04,904 --> 01:54:06,568
TRAVIS: Six?

2643
01:54:06,568 --> 01:54:07,736
SAM: No problem.

2644
01:54:07,736 --> 01:54:14,314
MATT: Like over all of the entire city. They're
pretty well scattered about. After you do a full

2645
01:54:14,314 --> 01:54:18,411
pass over the city, those are most of the details
you can make out at this height. Anything further,

2646
01:54:18,411 --> 01:54:22,710
any specifics, you want to go for before heading
back?

2647
01:54:22,975 --> 01:54:25,762
SAM: You want to set me down so I can go talk to
people?

2648
01:54:25,762 --> 01:54:26,920
MARISHA: You want to talk to people?

2649
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:31,624
SAM: Well, or at least eavesdrop. We don't know if
they're all vampires or not.

2650
01:54:31,624 --> 01:54:37,544
MARISHA: Does it look like there's a central part
where there's a lot of people gathered?

2651
01:54:37,544 --> 01:54:43,177
MATT: Farmlands look likely to be the largest
cluster of people. You can see, since it's getting

2652
01:54:43,177 --> 01:54:48,940
to the end of the day, there are folks finishing up gathering
the crops that were available to them or sort

2653
01:54:49,117 --> 01:54:52,868
of planting as they go through. And you can see
there's about five or six people that are all in

2654
01:54:52,868 --> 01:54:56,433
one group. Most everyone else seems to be
relatively solitary and trying to go about their

2655
01:54:56,433 --> 01:54:57,910
business as fast as possible.

2656
01:54:57,910 --> 01:54:59,397
MARISHA: The town square's emptying out?

2657
01:54:59,397 --> 01:55:03,256
MATT: The town square? Nobody is in the town
square. People are avoiding it like the plague.

2658
01:55:03,256 --> 01:55:06,761
There's eight bodies hanging from the tree, and
nobody wants to be there.

2659
01:55:06,761 --> 01:55:12,965
MARISHA: All right. I'm going to swoop down and
find a tree, where the five or six farmers are,

2660
01:55:12,965 --> 01:55:15,465
and perch, see if Scanlan can get a good--

2661
01:55:15,465 --> 01:55:17,891
MATT: There actually are no trees by the farm, all
the trees have been cleared out to make the

2662
01:55:17,891 --> 01:55:21,989
farmland. So there's actually a bit of the forest
that's been cleared for that purpose.

2663
01:55:22,062 --> 01:55:23,749
MARISHA: It's just open and empty.

2664
01:55:23,749 --> 01:55:27,905
MATT: Yeah. You can go to a tree that's nearby,
but that's like 300 feet away.

2665
01:55:27,905 --> 01:55:29,693
MARISHA: A rooftop? A wall? Anything I can perch
on?

2666
01:55:29,693 --> 01:55:32,275
MATT: There is a wall. There is a wall on the
outskirts of Whitestone.

2667
01:55:32,275 --> 01:55:33,631
MARISHA: I perch on the wall.

2668
01:55:33,631 --> 01:55:36,438
MATT: Okay. You swoop down and you perch on the
edge of the wall there. It's about 25 feet up.

2669
01:55:36,438 --> 01:55:45,512
SAM: I'm just going to walk down there. I won't be
able to see you, so I'm going to leave a little--

2670
01:55:45,512 --> 01:55:47,558
MARISHA: I'll keep an-- Oh, wait, I can't see
you.

2671
01:55:47,558 --> 01:55:51,138
MATT: And you can't talk right now, you're an
eagle.

2672
01:55:51,138 --> 01:55:59,004
SAM: I leave a little, like a canteen or
something, right where she's perched, just so I

2673
01:55:59,004 --> 01:56:00,308
know where to find her.

2674
01:56:00,308 --> 01:56:01,148
MATT: Okay.

2675
01:56:01,148 --> 01:56:02,303
TRAVIS: Smart.

2676
01:56:02,303 --> 01:56:03,668
TALIESIN: Leave the mug.

2677
01:56:03,668 --> 01:56:10,712
SAM: Yeah, my stein. And then I'm going to walk
down and see if I can stealthily

2678
01:56:10,712 --> 01:56:13,517
eavesdrop on some conversations.

2679
01:56:13,517 --> 01:56:19,071
MATT: Okay. You make your way down the 25-foot
wall she's perched on.

2680
01:56:19,071 --> 01:56:21,260
SAM: Oh, shit. Am I going to fall?

2681
01:56:21,260 --> 01:56:22,824
MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check to
climb.

2682
01:56:22,824 --> 01:56:24,999
TALIESIN: You say that out loud?

2683
01:56:25,605 --> 01:56:26,715
SAM: Athletics?

2684
01:56:26,715 --> 01:56:27,211
MATT: Yes.

2685
01:56:27,211 --> 01:56:28,079
SAM: 17.

2686
01:56:28,079 --> 01:56:35,183
MATT: 17. The stonework here is old and you manage
to not lose your footing entirely as you bring

2687
01:56:35,183 --> 01:56:38,813
your way down. Thankfully, you're light enough,
and the stones are not too large, so you can get

2688
01:56:38,813 --> 01:56:43,940
some good handholds. You do, over the next 12
minutes or so,

2689
01:56:43,940 --> 01:56:46,378
make your way to the base of the wall.

2690
01:56:46,378 --> 01:56:48,321
SAM: It took me 12 minutes to climb 25 feet?

2691
01:56:48,321 --> 01:56:49,060
MATT: Yep.

2692
01:56:49,060 --> 01:56:51,001
SAM: Nice. I suck.

2693
01:56:51,001 --> 01:56:53,332
MARISHA: Maybe whistle for me when you come back.

2694
01:56:53,332 --> 01:57:02,363
MATT: A lot of moments of (gasps) 'whoa, okay'.
But, you catch yourself. I mean, you can just jump

2695
01:57:02,363 --> 01:57:07,274
if you wanted to make it less. But, the duration
of your invisibility-- you have about 20 more

2696
01:57:07,274 --> 01:57:08,747
minutes before it dissipates.

2697
01:57:08,747 --> 01:57:09,887
SAM: Oh shit, I have to do this quick.

2698
01:57:09,887 --> 01:57:13,267
MATT: You look over the edge, and you can see that
they have carts up and that they have what

2699
01:57:13,267 --> 01:57:18,314
vegetables they have, and a lot of vegetables,
even at a close look, a lot of them look withered.

2700
01:57:18,314 --> 01:57:21,935
It looks like there is a general sense of
frustration that the land itself is not producing

2701
01:57:21,935 --> 01:57:28,628
quality crops. And even the people look unhealthy
and gaunt by nature. Whether it be the cold winter

2702
01:57:28,628 --> 01:57:33,921
recently or just their general spirit is broken,
but there is a feeling about these people that

2703
01:57:33,921 --> 01:57:40,723
life here is not what it used to be. There isn't a
whole lot of conversation, there's mutterings here

2704
01:57:40,723 --> 01:57:47,567
and there. "We have to make sure we get these back
in time. Fill the cart, we have two carts we have

2705
01:57:47,639 --> 01:57:50,312
"to get in." And the other one's, "I know, I know,
I'm trying," And they're putting it over there and

2706
01:57:50,312 --> 01:57:52,972
there's a little bit of frustration among them.

2707
01:57:52,972 --> 01:57:54,335
SAM: He's doing walla.

2708
01:57:54,335 --> 01:57:59,366
(all laugh)

2709
01:57:59,366 --> 01:58:07,278
MATT: One of them ends up counting the last bit of
crop. "That's it, that's all we have. That is the

2710
01:58:07,338 --> 01:58:11,104
"entire pull for the day." And the older gentleman,
who is overseeing it, grinds his hands and goes,

2711
01:58:11,104 --> 01:58:14,869
"Sir Kerrion is going to have my hide."

2712
01:58:14,869 --> 01:58:19,245
SAM: Wait, wasn't that one of the people--

2713
01:58:19,245 --> 01:58:27,827
MATT: "At the very least, let's gather it together
and hopefully Pelor will protect us." And the

2714
01:58:27,827 --> 01:58:34,411
people take the carts and begin making their way
towards the outer gate on the southeast side of

2715
01:58:34,411 --> 01:58:36,934
Whitestone, where you guys are currently at.

2716
01:58:36,934 --> 01:58:41,832
SAM: Okay. I'm going to hustle back to the roof.

2717
01:58:41,832 --> 01:58:43,717
MATT: All right. Make an athletics check.

2718
01:58:43,717 --> 01:58:45,237
SAM: Jesus.

2719
01:58:45,237 --> 01:58:47,008
MARISHA: I can come get you.

2720
01:58:47,008 --> 01:58:49,904
TALIESIN: You'll hear a thump.

2721
01:58:49,904 --> 01:58:50,988
SAM: Eight.

2722
01:58:50,988 --> 01:58:53,347
(all laugh)

2723
01:58:53,347 --> 01:58:55,535
LIAM: Hopefully he lands on his lute.

2724
01:58:55,535 --> 01:58:57,116
SAM: No, it's nine.

2725
01:58:57,116 --> 01:59:05,825
MATT: Okay. 15 minutes. After five minutes of
eavesdropping you realize that you are not going

2726
01:59:05,825 --> 01:59:11,931
to make it up that wall, and you feel the magic of
your Invisibility illusion about to fade. At this

2727
01:59:11,931 --> 01:59:15,759
point, by the way, the sun has just hit the edge
of the mountains, the sky itself is a vibrant,

2728
01:59:15,759 --> 01:59:20,284
reddish orange slowly turning to purple and sunset
is upon you.

2729
01:59:25,363 --> 01:59:26,958
SAM: I want to spend the night here. No.

2730
01:59:27,212 --> 01:59:28,983
MARISHA: Can I see him?

2731
01:59:28,983 --> 01:59:30,790
MATT: He's invisible, no.

2732
01:59:30,790 --> 01:59:35,279
SAM: I will sneak around the corner a little bit,
wait for an opening, and I lose Invisibility,

2733
01:59:35,279 --> 01:59:40,267
which will drop it on her as well, and I will
Dimension Door back up to the roof.

2734
01:59:40,267 --> 01:59:47,951
MATT: Okay. As you pass to the side, the illusion
fades, you step into a small opening of dark,

2735
01:59:47,951 --> 01:59:51,309
purplish energy and then reemerge on the top of
the wall--

2736
01:59:51,309 --> 01:59:53,027
MATT and SAM: Grab the canteen.

2737
01:59:53,027 --> 01:59:54,299
MATT: --and hop back on the back of her.

2738
01:59:54,299 --> 01:59:56,346
SAM: Oh, shit. Invisibility again.

2739
01:59:56,346 --> 02:00:03,882
MATT: Okay. Okay. You guys vanish, and Keyleth,
you take off back in the direction you guys

2740
02:00:03,882 --> 02:00:08,424
traveled from. In the meantime, guys, what do you
want to have been doing? Are you just waiting, are

2741
02:00:08,424 --> 02:00:10,061
you traveling further in, are you staying where
you are?

2742
02:00:10,061 --> 02:00:11,386
TRAVIS: (snores)

2743
02:00:11,386 --> 02:00:12,590
TALIESIN: We have to wait.

2744
02:00:12,590 --> 02:00:16,873
LAURA: Yeah, keeping an ear out for the wolves and
just chilling in a tree.

2745
02:00:16,873 --> 02:00:18,292
TRAVIS: (yells) I fall out of the tree.

2746
02:00:18,292 --> 02:00:21,241
LAURA: And also, I'm restringing my new, awesome
bow.

2747
02:00:21,241 --> 02:00:22,825
MATT: With the--?

2748
02:00:22,825 --> 02:00:24,171
LAURA: With the blazing bowstring.

2749
02:00:24,171 --> 02:00:25,872
MATT: Okay.

2750
02:00:25,872 --> 02:00:30,004
LAURA: Which, by the way, is a longbow of sky
sentinel.

2751
02:00:30,004 --> 02:00:32,488
SAM: Sky sentinel, what does that mean?

2752
02:00:32,488 --> 02:00:42,121
LAURA: Once per long rest, I can use a Storm
Arrow, which means that the next arrow I fire

2753
02:00:42,121 --> 02:00:50,594
splits into three arrows. Roll an attack for each
of them, they all get 1d6 extra for each one that

2754
02:00:50,594 --> 02:00:53,821
hits. It's amazing!

2755
02:00:53,821 --> 02:00:55,603
SAM: Every time you use it, or is at a one-time--

2756
02:00:55,603 --> 02:00:57,537
LAURA: It's one time per long rest.

2757
02:00:57,537 --> 02:00:58,834
MARISHA: That's awesome!

2758
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:02,119
MATT: Once per day, she fires an arrow and the
arrow splits into three, and each one bursts into

2759
02:01:02,119 --> 02:01:04,564
thunder damage, bursts of them.

2760
02:01:04,564 --> 02:01:07,612
LAURA: Say what?! So, is it lightning damage or is
it--

2761
02:01:07,612 --> 02:01:09,201
MATT: Thunder damage. It should say on there.

2762
02:01:09,201 --> 02:01:10,093
LAURA: It says lightning damage.

2763
02:01:10,093 --> 02:01:10,970
MATT: Oh, then it would be lightning damage.

2764
02:01:10,970 --> 02:01:12,359
MARISHA: It's a taser arrow.

2765
02:01:12,359 --> 02:01:13,408
TALIESIN: It's basically a taser.

2766
02:01:13,408 --> 02:01:16,164
MATT: So yeah, it's pretty fun.

2767
02:01:16,164 --> 02:01:17,463
SAM: Thunder!

2768
02:01:17,463 --> 02:01:19,423
LAURA: Thunder!

2769
02:01:19,423 --> 02:01:20,918
MATT: What's that from?

2770
02:01:20,918 --> 02:01:23,105
SAM: I don't know.

2771
02:01:23,105 --> 02:01:29,269
MATT: So, the night falls and the crickets begin
to emerge, the slow mist begins to form.

2772
02:01:29,269 --> 02:01:31,886
LAURA: Wait, our friends aren't back yet. It's
already night and they're not back?

2773
02:01:31,886 --> 02:01:38,347
LIAM: I just want to say that I pulled my hood
down, and put on my calamari hat, and pulled the

2774
02:01:38,347 --> 02:01:39,579
hood back over it.

2775
02:01:39,579 --> 02:01:50,391
MATT: Okay. So you take the partially rusted over,
but functional, metallic skull cap that Clarota

2776
02:01:50,391 --> 02:01:55,717
was wearing when you guys met in the Underdark,
that Clarota no longer needs.

2777
02:01:56,507 --> 02:01:57,734
TRAVIS: Because he's dead.

2778
02:01:57,734 --> 02:02:00,867
MATT: You place it on your head and it's a little
loose. As you place it on, it rattles for a

2779
02:02:00,867 --> 02:02:06,598
moment, and then it form-fits to your skull. Your
hair being pinched beneath it and just emerging

2780
02:02:06,598 --> 02:02:09,426
from underneath, almost Loki-helmet-style.

2781
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:11,420
LAURA: Looking snazzy, Vax.

2782
02:02:11,420 --> 02:02:13,057
TRAVIS: Nice bonnet.

2783
02:02:13,057 --> 02:02:16,059
SAM: (imitating Clarota) I'm on your head.

2784
02:02:16,059 --> 02:02:20,655
MATT: There's a weird buzzing vibrational feel as
its magic attunes to you over the next hour or so

2785
02:02:20,655 --> 02:02:23,687
as you're waiting, but you get the sensation that
it will offer some decent

2786
02:02:23,687 --> 02:02:29,796
protection from impeding charm effects.

2787
02:02:29,796 --> 02:02:30,666
LIAM: It tingles.

2788
02:02:30,666 --> 02:02:33,057
LAURA: It looks like you have a mullet.

2789
02:02:33,057 --> 02:02:34,640
LIAM: Yeah, dude.

2790
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:41,186
MATT: A Loki mullet. You start to get really
nervous about the arrival of your friends, until

2791
02:02:41,186 --> 02:02:48,125
eventually you hear the flapping of wings. You
look up and you can see, since it has taken an

2792
02:02:48,125 --> 02:02:54,924
hour to get there, the illusion just fades, both a
giant eagle and Scanlan appear in the moonlight,

2793
02:02:54,924 --> 02:02:59,239
right above the canopy of the forest you guys are
close to, and return to the place you were.

2794
02:02:59,239 --> 02:03:10,292
LAURA: Keyleth, question. Can you make it look
like we're not here with your foliage shit?

2795
02:03:10,292 --> 02:03:15,213
MARISHA: I drop my Beast Shape, holding onto a
branch.

2796
02:03:15,213 --> 02:03:16,696
LAURA: You know, the illusions.

2797
02:03:16,696 --> 02:03:17,669
MARISHA: Yeah.

2798
02:03:17,669 --> 02:03:18,793
TALIESIN: Good, good.

2799
02:03:18,793 --> 02:03:21,008
LAURA: Can we camp up in the tree? So nobody can
come towards us.

2800
02:03:21,008 --> 02:03:21,803
MARISHA: Yeah.

2801
02:03:21,803 --> 02:03:23,361
SAM: What if we fall out?

2802
02:03:23,361 --> 02:03:27,286
MARISHA: I Druidcraft some spiderweb hammocks.

2803
02:03:27,286 --> 02:03:29,046
LAURA: Ooh.

2804
02:03:29,046 --> 02:03:33,332
TALIESIN: Sticky.

2805
02:03:34,186 --> 02:03:36,990
MARISHA: And, as usual, light some sage.

2806
02:03:37,730 --> 02:03:40,805
MATT: Takes about an hour or so, but you manage to
pull from the surroundings these really nice,

2807
02:03:40,805 --> 02:03:45,989
thick spider silk hammocks, that should be able to
support your respective weights. Grog is the only

2808
02:03:45,989 --> 02:03:51,009
one that might be questionable with the sheer
amount of weight that is his form.

2809
02:03:51,009 --> 02:03:52,110
TRAVIS: I like it.

2810
02:03:52,110 --> 02:03:54,404
MARISHA: Maybe take a rope and tie it.

2811
02:03:54,404 --> 02:03:57,369
TRAVIS: Nope, this is a trust exercise.

2812
02:03:57,369 --> 02:04:02,183
LAURA: I'm using Hide in Plain Sight to make me
and Trinket extra, extra hidey.

2813
02:04:02,183 --> 02:04:06,008
LIAM: I have a question. The only reason I have
this question is because I posted that video from

2814
02:04:06,008 --> 02:04:10,360
a couple of years ago. Do I still have the
unending rope?

2815
02:04:10,360 --> 02:04:12,277
LAURA: I have the unending rope, motherfucker.

2816
02:04:12,277 --> 02:04:16,610
LIAM: Why don't we reinforce with the rope?

2817
02:04:16,610 --> 02:04:17,682
LAURA: Sure, why not.

2818
02:04:17,682 --> 02:04:19,060
TRAVIS: You don't like the trust exercise?

2819
02:04:19,060 --> 02:04:20,725
LAURA: That's where all the rope comes from that
we ever use.

2820
02:04:20,725 --> 02:04:23,259
LIAM: I'm sorry I brought it up. I'd love you to
fall on your head.

2821
02:04:23,259 --> 02:04:25,375
LAURA: Let's reinforce the spiderwebs.

2822
02:04:25,375 --> 02:04:27,652
TRAVIS: No, I'm good, thank you.

2823
02:04:27,652 --> 02:04:37,723
MARISHA: Whoa, Vax. Nice helmet. Don Quixote
called.

2824
02:04:37,723 --> 02:04:39,593
LIAM: Aerodynamic, isn't it?

2825
02:04:39,593 --> 02:04:41,248
MARISHA: He wants his bowl back.

2826
02:04:41,248 --> 02:04:44,700
SAM: Before we slumber, we did a little intel, a
little recon.

2827
02:04:44,700 --> 02:04:45,864
LAURA: Oh, yeah. What's up?

2828
02:04:45,864 --> 02:04:53,165
SAM: Turns out the town is full of humans, except
for these six vampire giants-- zombie giants.

2829
02:04:53,165 --> 02:04:56,989
MARISHA: They all appear to be fairly miserable
people.

2830
02:04:56,989 --> 02:05:02,719
SAM: However, this could be useful. Everyone in
the town, the farmers anyway, seem to be gathering

2831
02:05:02,719 --> 02:05:12,427
produce to deliver to the Briarwoods. We could
pose as some sort of farmer troupe with a basket

2832
02:05:12,427 --> 02:05:15,112
of goodies, and maybe get through the front gate.

2833
02:05:15,112 --> 02:05:18,463
LAURA: Don't you think they would know all the
farmers around at this point? They've been there

2834
02:05:18,463 --> 02:05:19,726
for a long time.

2835
02:05:19,726 --> 02:05:23,833
MARISHA: They did reference Sir Kerrion by name.
Oh, they referenced Sir Kerrion, Percy.

2836
02:05:23,833 --> 02:05:25,012
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2837
02:05:25,012 --> 02:05:32,628
SAM: We could make ourselves look like some of
them. One of us has a hat of disguise.

2838
02:05:32,628 --> 02:05:36,612
MARISHA: Also, there was something other really
important.

2839
02:05:36,612 --> 02:05:37,997
SAM: What?

2840
02:05:37,997 --> 02:05:39,686
MARISHA: The town was pretty much empty.

2841
02:05:39,686 --> 02:05:40,801
SAM: Oh, yes, this.

2842
02:05:40,801 --> 02:05:46,055
MARISHA: And that Sun Tree, that what's-his-name--
Who said that? Jarett?

2843
02:05:46,055 --> 02:05:46,975
MATT: Desmond.

2844
02:05:46,975 --> 02:05:56,162
MARISHA: Desmond. Looks like there were some
executions that took place. There were about eight

2845
02:05:56,162 --> 02:05:59,002
bodies hanging from that tree.

2846
02:05:59,002 --> 02:06:01,238
LAURA: Why is it called the Sun Tree?

2847
02:06:01,238 --> 02:06:07,242
SAM: It's really lovely. I don't know, maybe it
gets sun.

2848
02:06:07,242 --> 02:06:09,529
MARISHA: I don't know. Why do they call it the Sun
Tree?

2849
02:06:09,529 --> 02:06:14,265
TALIESIN: Can I go with this? Unless you have a
particular reason to--

2850
02:06:14,507 --> 02:06:17,928
MATT: I mean, you can go with-- There are maybe
many reasons it's called the Sun Tree.

2851
02:06:17,928 --> 02:06:21,534
LAURA: There's reasons. Maybe we need to battle
them at the Sun Tree.

2852
02:06:21,534 --> 02:06:27,252
TALIESIN: Legends say that before the castle was
built, that the journey into the valley was

2853
02:06:27,252 --> 02:06:34,663
treacherous and stormy, and the original builders
of Whitecastle feared they would die. And this

2854
02:06:34,663 --> 02:06:40,599
one, great tree stood in the valley, and it was
underneath it that they took shelter. And as they

2855
02:06:40,599 --> 02:06:44,353
began to take shelter, the storm broke. And the
storm did not return

2856
02:06:44,353 --> 02:06:46,827
until the castle was completed.

2857
02:06:46,827 --> 02:06:48,969
SAM: That's a lovely story.

2858
02:06:48,969 --> 02:06:54,081
TALIESIN: We hold our festivals there every year.

2859
02:06:54,081 --> 02:06:56,321
SAM: And now it's being used as a--

2860
02:06:56,321 --> 02:06:57,616
TALIESIN: As a gallow, yes.

2861
02:06:57,616 --> 02:06:59,662
LAURA: Does it get a lot of sun?

2862
02:06:59,662 --> 02:07:08,417
MATT: You do know, and this ties into your story
as well, because the guidance in forging the city

2863
02:07:08,417 --> 02:07:15,114
of Whitestone, that tree was representative to
them as a guardian of Pelor, the god of the sun.

2864
02:07:15,114 --> 02:07:18,727
The protector of light, holiness--

2865
02:07:18,727 --> 02:07:19,913
SAM: Who that?

2866
02:07:19,913 --> 02:07:21,596
TALIESIN: A very serious god.

2867
02:07:21,596 --> 02:07:23,441
TRAVIS: That could help.

2868
02:07:23,441 --> 02:07:26,500
LAURA: That could help us, because vampires hate
the sun.

2869
02:07:26,500 --> 02:07:30,293
SAM: Why would they make camp in the place where
the god of the sun--

2870
02:07:30,293 --> 02:07:33,302
LAURA: Maybe that's why they're hanging bodies
from it, to taint it.

2871
02:07:33,302 --> 02:07:36,379
LIAM: Maybe that's why it's protected. Maybe--

2872
02:07:36,379 --> 02:07:40,974
SAM: Are any of us religious with that god, or--?

2873
02:07:40,974 --> 02:07:43,986
MARISHA: Can we call Pike through your magic poo?

2874
02:07:43,986 --> 02:07:45,668
LAURA: Would she be able to hear us?

2875
02:07:45,668 --> 02:07:46,893
TALIESIN: Tablet of Apple?

2876
02:07:46,893 --> 02:07:48,414
SAM: I can at least see what she is up to.

2877
02:07:48,414 --> 02:07:51,342
LIAM: Keyleth, would you be able to revive the
tree?

2878
02:07:51,342 --> 02:07:56,024
LAURA: (gasps) Bring it back.

2879
02:07:56,024 --> 02:07:59,708
SAM: What would that do?

2880
02:07:59,708 --> 02:08:01,779
MARISHA: Yeah, I can, actually.

2881
02:08:01,779 --> 02:08:04,779
LAURA: I don't know. Bring up the god of the sun
again, I don't know.

2882
02:08:04,779 --> 02:08:08,910
SAM: We're not religious people. We can't summon
the gods willy-nilly.

2883
02:08:08,910 --> 02:08:10,187
LIAM: We can please Pelor.

2884
02:08:10,187 --> 02:08:12,257
LAURA: Don't tell us what we can and can't do,
Scanlan.

2885
02:08:12,257 --> 02:08:16,858
SAM: I'm sorry. We can do all of those things.
Yes, let's go in the middle of the

2886
02:08:16,858 --> 02:08:24,349
vampire-infested town and do some arbory to try to
heal the tree, and then we'll just say, oh, sun

2887
02:08:24,349 --> 02:08:26,111
god, please rain down sun here.

2888
02:08:26,111 --> 02:08:27,027
LAURA: I like it. Let's do it.

2889
02:08:27,027 --> 02:08:29,173
SAM: That's a great plan.

2890
02:08:29,173 --> 02:08:32,809
TRAVIS: Can we at least try cutting down the
bodies and running, and seeing what happens?

2891
02:08:32,809 --> 02:08:36,908
SAM: We could.

2892
02:08:36,908 --> 02:08:43,660
TALIESIN: I say, in the morning we take a look at
the passage, see how well-guarded it is. And if it

2893
02:08:43,660 --> 02:08:50,970
looks dangerous, sneak our way into the town. If
people are not enthralled, if they are being

2894
02:08:50,970 --> 02:08:54,209
forced to work, then maybe we can find some
allies.

2895
02:08:54,209 --> 02:08:56,946
MARISHA: Find allies in the town?

2896
02:08:56,946 --> 02:08:58,459
TALIESIN: I don't think they're happy.

2897
02:08:58,459 --> 02:09:02,138
LAURA: I think they're terrified. And I don't want
to let them know we're here, for fear they'll turn

2898
02:09:02,138 --> 02:09:05,004
us in, in hopes of saving their own necks.

2899
02:09:05,004 --> 02:09:09,001
MARISHA: That's what I'm thinking. Yes, they're
terrified, but this whole

2900
02:09:09,001 --> 02:09:11,110
town's being ruled by fear.

2901
02:09:11,110 --> 02:09:21,449
LIAM: I have a feeling we can revive that tree
somehow. It may weaken the Briarwoods' hold on the

2902
02:09:21,449 --> 02:09:23,832
psyche of the villagers here.

2903
02:09:23,832 --> 02:09:29,412
LAURA: This is true! It could help out. Let them
know the god of the sun is on their side.

2904
02:09:29,412 --> 02:09:33,279
TRAVIS: I heard you're supposed to pee on a lemon
tree, so.

2905
02:09:33,279 --> 02:09:38,038
LAURA: Probably you and Scanlan are on that, I
have a feeling.

2906
02:09:38,038 --> 02:09:41,918
TRAVIS: Can I make a nature check to see if that's
true?

2907
02:09:41,918 --> 02:09:46,827
TALIESIN: I really wanted to ask. What does peeing
on a lemon tree have to do with anything?

2908
02:09:46,827 --> 02:09:48,920
MATT: Sure.

2909
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:52,703
TRAVIS: 19! That's 17.

2910
02:09:52,703 --> 02:09:56,647
MATT: In your experience with the roving band of
barbarians, you guys enjoyed very much peeing on

2911
02:09:56,647 --> 02:10:03,227
very colorful trees, of all sorts of plant life.
All of them, generally, didn't seem to, over time,

2912
02:10:03,227 --> 02:10:08,446
react well to the process, whether it be the fact
that you all drank a lot of the time, so the

2913
02:10:08,446 --> 02:10:10,606
content of your urine was probably not very
hospitable.

2914
02:10:10,606 --> 02:10:12,516
LIAM: It's known as a lemon party.

2915
02:10:12,516 --> 02:10:16,426
(all laugh)

2916
02:10:16,426 --> 02:10:19,448
MATT: That's a whole different kind of festival.

2917
02:10:19,448 --> 02:10:20,560
MARISHA: You killed Percy.

2918
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:22,532
LAURA: You killed Percy.

2919
02:10:22,532 --> 02:10:26,218
TALIESIN: Thank you for bringing the text chat all
the way back around.

2920
02:10:26,218 --> 02:10:28,858
TRAVIS: Operation tree rescue.

2921
02:10:28,858 --> 02:10:33,029
MATT: The lemon party is held on the far, far
southern continent of Tubgirl,

2922
02:10:33,029 --> 02:10:39,458
the region of Goatse.

2923
02:10:39,458 --> 02:10:46,388
TRAVIS: I have an idea. Should we wait until the
sun comes up, create a distraction, so all the

2924
02:10:46,388 --> 02:10:52,001
undead giants come looking, and then we have
someone go cut the bodies off the tree, and--

2925
02:10:52,001 --> 02:10:53,767
LAURA: And bring it back to life!

2926
02:10:53,767 --> 02:10:55,830
TRAVIS: -- let Keyleth give it a little love.

2927
02:10:55,830 --> 02:10:57,779
MARISHA: And then what happens after that?

2928
02:10:57,779 --> 02:10:59,390
TRAVIS: I don't know. It's an experiment, all
right?

2929
02:10:59,390 --> 02:11:01,164
LAURA: Then we get the fuck out.

2930
02:11:01,164 --> 02:11:03,765
SAM: Won't they know we're here? Won't the people
see us doing things?

2931
02:11:03,765 --> 02:11:08,156
MARISHA: I know. I feel that's the equivalent of
putting dish soap in the fountain on prom night.

2932
02:11:08,156 --> 02:11:10,774
LAURA: No! Didn't you say that all around the Sun
Tree nobody's there?

2933
02:11:10,774 --> 02:11:13,021
MARISHA: Yeah, we did that. What?

2934
02:11:13,021 --> 02:11:15,093
LAURA: Didn't you say nobody's around the Sun
Tree?

2935
02:11:15,093 --> 02:11:18,147
SAM: That's true. But we still have to get in.

2936
02:11:18,147 --> 02:11:20,102
LAURA: We'll fly up and over. You just did the
same thing.

2937
02:11:20,102 --> 02:11:21,085
SAM: I know, I know.

2938
02:11:21,085 --> 02:11:24,005
LAURA: Fly up and over, land, bring the tree back
to life, get out.

2939
02:11:24,005 --> 02:11:27,777
SAM: Are you sure you don't want me to be a
carriage driver, and you'll hide in the hay of my

2940
02:11:27,777 --> 02:11:30,688
carriage and I'll go straight up to the
Briarwoods.

2941
02:11:30,688 --> 02:11:32,521
LAURA: I feel like they know all the townspeople.

2942
02:11:32,521 --> 02:11:35,324
SAM: I will put on my hat of disguise, I will be
someone completely different.

2943
02:11:35,324 --> 02:11:36,330
TRAVIS: They can see through that.

2944
02:11:36,330 --> 02:11:38,677
LIAM: I'm telling you, they looked right through
me.

2945
02:11:38,677 --> 02:11:39,775
LAURA: When he was invisible!

2946
02:11:39,775 --> 02:11:42,604
LIAM: Invisible. They saw me.

2947
02:11:42,604 --> 02:11:43,578
LAURA: They probably saw you!

2948
02:11:43,578 --> 02:11:45,883
SAM: So while he was transparent, they saw through
him?

2949
02:11:45,883 --> 02:11:48,584
LIAM: No, but I was heavily stealthed.

2950
02:11:48,584 --> 02:11:49,580
LAURA: No, you were invisible.

2951
02:11:49,580 --> 02:11:50,715
MARISHA: Oh, wow!

2952
02:11:50,715 --> 02:11:53,806
MATT: No, the invisibility faded when he attacked
the guard.

2953
02:11:53,806 --> 02:12:00,262
LIAM: When I beaned the guard. They should not
have been able to see me.

2954
02:12:00,262 --> 02:12:05,067
SAM: I'm not talking about getting past the
Briarwoods. I'm talking about getting past the

2955
02:12:05,067 --> 02:12:07,689
guards that guard their castle.

2956
02:12:07,689 --> 02:12:13,071
MARISHA: Here's another issue. It's going to take
me a minute to do the tree.

2957
02:12:13,071 --> 02:12:15,346
LAURA: How long?

2958
02:12:15,346 --> 02:12:16,736
MARISHA: It might take a bit.

2959
02:12:16,736 --> 02:12:18,892
LAURA: How long's a bit?

2960
02:12:18,892 --> 02:12:26,503
MARISHA: Well, I mean, it's one of those things
where the longer I do it the better it'll be. I

2961
02:12:26,503 --> 02:12:28,813
can do it for up to eight hours.

2962
02:12:28,813 --> 02:12:29,893
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

2963
02:12:29,893 --> 02:12:35,920
MARISHA: If I do it for up to eight hours, I
enrich the land over half a mile radius, centered

2964
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:39,094
on a single point, and the land becomes enriched
for a solid year.

2965
02:12:39,094 --> 02:12:40,368
LAURA: I don't want to enrich all of the--

2966
02:12:40,368 --> 02:12:44,416
LIAM: Question. What time was it when they were
doing their little scouting thing they've just

2967
02:12:44,416 --> 02:12:47,515
told us about? The sun was going down?

2968
02:12:47,515 --> 02:12:51,980
MATT: Yeah, they probably would've gotten to
Whitestone around seven o'clock, and leaving right

2969
02:12:51,980 --> 02:12:54,280
as the sun had fully set.

2970
02:12:54,280 --> 02:12:55,593
LAURA: If we go right when the sun goes up--

2971
02:12:55,593 --> 02:13:03,245
LIAM: Yes, we get there at sunrise, take those
fucking beasts out, and you start at eight AM.

2972
02:13:03,245 --> 02:13:04,477
SAM: But then what?

2973
02:13:04,477 --> 02:13:10,907
LAURA: We just sneak in. Here's the thing. I don't
know if you want to get all the crops all fancy,

2974
02:13:10,907 --> 02:13:15,064
because it'll just feed the Briarwoods. Maybe just
do the tree area,

2975
02:13:15,064 --> 02:13:17,085
which will be like two hours, maybe.

2976
02:13:17,085 --> 02:13:20,854
MARISHA: Yeah? I think if I have a solid hour or
two hours with it.

2977
02:13:20,854 --> 02:13:28,130
SAM: Once the tree is healed, we have no one of
religious power to summon any god. We don't know

2978
02:13:28,130 --> 02:13:30,691
anything about this god, none of us do!

2979
02:13:30,691 --> 02:13:33,783
TALIESIN: I do, in theory, if I'm from--

2980
02:13:33,783 --> 02:13:35,785
MATT: Go ahead and roll a religion check.

2981
02:13:35,785 --> 02:13:36,603
TALIESIN: A which?

2982
02:13:36,603 --> 02:13:37,667
MATT: A religion check.

2983
02:13:37,667 --> 02:13:38,729
LAURA: A witch?

2984
02:13:38,729 --> 02:13:40,236
MATT: A witch.

2985
02:13:40,236 --> 02:13:41,303
TALIESIN: 16.

2986
02:13:41,303 --> 02:13:49,040
MATT: 16? Okay. Pelor is the god of the sun and
agriculture. It's a good deity and is generally

2987
02:13:49,040 --> 02:13:56,544
worshipped by farmers and simple folk and people
that live off the land, and generally it's the

2988
02:13:56,544 --> 02:14:01,424
most nature-based deity of the main spectrum,
outside of Melora, which is the deity of nature.

2989
02:14:01,424 --> 02:14:06,107
MARISHA: Oh. Well, dope! Would I know stuff like
that too, then?

2990
02:14:06,107 --> 02:14:11,994
MATT: You know of Pelor, yeah. There are elements
of Pelor's following that bleeds into your druidic

2991
02:14:11,994 --> 02:14:14,458
nature, though you don't necessarily follow a
deity.

2992
02:14:14,458 --> 02:14:16,618
MARISHA: Right. We're free.

2993
02:14:16,618 --> 02:14:19,025
MATT: You believe that the essence of nature in
itself is your patron.

2994
02:14:19,025 --> 02:14:20,509
MARISHA: Totally.

2995
02:14:20,509 --> 02:14:24,589
MATT: You are not a religious man by nature, and
you know that there is a strong following of Pelor

2996
02:14:24,589 --> 02:14:29,725
in the town. The entire graveyard that you talked
about earlier, that one is largely built around

2997
02:14:29,725 --> 02:14:37,284
the imagery of Pelor. And of all the gods that are
worshipped here, Pelor's probably 75% of the

2998
02:14:37,284 --> 02:14:42,067
population of Whitestone where, in some shape or
form, if not devout worshippers, at least were

2999
02:14:42,067 --> 02:14:44,452
like, yeah, Pelor's cool.

3000
02:14:44,452 --> 02:14:56,889
MARISHA: Here's my question. I feel Pike's energy
tonight. Maybe, while I'm meditating, I can

3001
02:14:56,889 --> 02:15:04,365
somehow reach out to her, and maybe ask her to get
in touch with Sarenrae, and maybe Sarenrae can

3002
02:15:04,365 --> 02:15:06,470
call up her homeboy Pelor.

3003
02:15:06,470 --> 02:15:07,795
LAURA: Do you think that works?

3004
02:15:07,795 --> 02:15:09,726
MARISHA: I don't know.

3005
02:15:09,726 --> 02:15:10,972
TRAVIS: This is like phone a friend?

3006
02:15:10,972 --> 02:15:14,034
MARISHA: We're not organized religion people, we
Ashari.

3007
02:15:14,034 --> 02:15:21,068
LIAM: The tree is called the Sun Tree. It's
Pelor's tree. I'm not a cleric of Sarenrae, but

3008
02:15:21,068 --> 02:15:25,003
these shitbags could not have set up camp in a
temple of Sarenrae because there is too much

3009
02:15:25,003 --> 02:15:31,462
goodness there, as there was around this tree in
this town, and it's why it is dead. It's why it's

3010
02:15:31,462 --> 02:15:35,814
being surrounded by a bunch of giant undead
things, as you described.

3011
02:15:35,814 --> 02:15:38,556
You need faith, Scanlan Shorthalt.

3012
02:15:38,556 --> 02:15:43,225
SAM: Me? I am the antithesis of faith.

3013
02:15:43,225 --> 02:15:47,177
LIAM: Then you need to shut up and let us fix that
tree.

3014
02:15:47,177 --> 02:15:48,541
SAM: And then what?

3015
02:15:48,541 --> 02:15:50,417
TRAVIS: Who knows?

3016
02:15:50,417 --> 02:15:54,213
SAM: We're going to fight off a million monsters
to heal a tree, and then we're going to say,

3017
02:15:54,213 --> 02:15:58,340
"Okay. Bring out the sun," or something.

3018
02:15:58,340 --> 02:16:02,798
MARISHA: Hang on! What did you just say?

3019
02:16:02,798 --> 02:16:04,471
TALIESIN: What?

3020
02:16:04,471 --> 02:16:08,646
MARISHA: That thing you just said that no one
heard because we were all shouting and arguing?

3021
02:16:08,646 --> 02:16:10,827
Rally the townsfolk?

3022
02:16:10,827 --> 02:16:16,840
TALIESIN: Rally the townsfolk. This is something I
think-- I don't think that sneaking in is

3023
02:16:16,840 --> 02:16:24,478
necessarily the answer. I'm not saying go in, guns
blazing, but I say we let them know--

3024
02:16:24,752 --> 02:16:26,427
MARISHA: You want to build a militia?

3025
02:16:26,427 --> 02:16:28,210
TALIESIN: I want to build a rebellion.

3026
02:16:28,210 --> 02:16:30,547
LAURA: I like it. They would recognize you,
wouldn't they, Percy?

3027
02:16:30,547 --> 02:16:32,150
TALIESIN: I have a plan.

3028
02:16:32,150 --> 02:16:33,184
TRAVIS: You have a plan?

3029
02:16:33,184 --> 02:16:36,067
SAM: Does it involve healing the tree?

3030
02:16:36,067 --> 02:16:36,923
TALIESIN: It does.

3031
02:16:36,923 --> 02:16:39,849
LIAM: I don't think there is any sneaking in,
thanks to those birds,

3032
02:16:39,849 --> 02:16:42,417
so we make a stand out here.

3033
02:16:42,417 --> 02:16:44,439
TRAVIS: Tell us your plan.

3034
02:16:44,439 --> 02:16:49,936
TALIESIN: My plan is, we do our best to sneak in,
we find cover. Obviously, you said there's

3035
02:16:49,936 --> 02:16:59,722
abandoned buildings. We find cover. We heal the
tree. I have some other ideas. We take those

3036
02:16:59,722 --> 02:17:04,555
zombie giants out one by one, quietly.

3037
02:17:04,555 --> 02:17:06,251
SAM: We're going to be insurgents?

3038
02:17:06,251 --> 02:17:07,860
TRAVIS: Shh! Let him finish the plan!

3039
02:17:07,860 --> 02:17:09,446
SAM: I kind of love this.

3040
02:17:09,446 --> 02:17:10,368
TALIESIN: Okay.

3041
02:17:10,368 --> 02:17:11,968
MARISHA: It's like Attack on Titan. That's cool!

3042
02:17:11,968 --> 02:17:15,658
TALIESIN: Let's start finding our friends, and we
start making friends.

3043
02:17:15,658 --> 02:17:18,502
We let them know we're back.

3044
02:17:18,502 --> 02:17:19,651
LAURA: I like it.

3045
02:17:19,651 --> 02:17:24,650
MARISHA: I like having the people. It feels less
like we're the United States.

3046
02:17:24,650 --> 02:17:25,896
TRAVIS: Okay, where do we start?

3047
02:17:25,896 --> 02:17:29,850
TALIESIN: I have some parchment. I have the thing
I want to build, while I'm in the tree. It's very

3048
02:17:29,850 --> 02:17:32,685
simple, and I want to show you what it is.

3049
02:17:32,685 --> 02:17:36,064
MATT: What is it?

3050
02:17:36,064 --> 02:17:40,951
TALIESIN: I want to take some gunpowder and
basically--

3051
02:17:40,951 --> 02:17:42,926
SAM: Make a pipe bomb.

3052
02:17:42,926 --> 02:17:47,030
TALIESIN: Basically attach it to a piece of
parchment. I want to wet it into a piece of

3053
02:17:47,030 --> 02:17:54,535
parchment and let it dry so that when I set fire
to that piece of parchment, I get a burn scar. I'd

3054
02:17:54,535 --> 02:17:55,808
like to create a burn scar.

3055
02:17:55,808 --> 02:17:56,729
LAURA: (gasps)

3056
02:17:56,729 --> 02:17:57,639
MATT: Yeah, that's totally doable.

3057
02:17:57,639 --> 02:17:58,501
TALIESIN: Thank you.

3058
02:17:58,501 --> 02:18:04,681
MATT: Go ahead and roll a tinkering check, just
for the sake of a possible epic failure.

3059
02:18:04,681 --> 02:18:06,161
MARISHA: A burn on yourself?

3060
02:18:06,161 --> 02:18:10,730
TALIESIN: No, it'll scar anything. It just creates
a very high heat.

3061
02:18:10,730 --> 02:18:11,637
SAM: Like a mark?

3062
02:18:11,637 --> 02:18:12,580
MARISHA: Like a brand.

3063
02:18:12,580 --> 02:18:13,766
SAM: Like our mark.

3064
02:18:13,766 --> 02:18:14,776
TALIESIN: Like a mark.

3065
02:18:14,776 --> 02:18:16,023
SAM: Like our mark.

3066
02:18:16,023 --> 02:18:16,770
TALIESIN: Not our mark.

3067
02:18:16,770 --> 02:18:17,773
SAM: The resistance.

3068
02:18:17,773 --> 02:18:18,905
TALIESIN: The resistance.

3069
02:18:18,905 --> 02:18:20,201
SAM: I need a beret.

3070
02:18:20,201 --> 02:18:22,531
(all laugh)

3071
02:18:22,531 --> 02:18:25,103
TALIESIN: I rolled a 23.

3072
02:18:25,103 --> 02:18:31,851
MATT: While the rest of you end up taking your
evening's rest, Grog, you immediately snap your

3073
02:18:31,851 --> 02:18:34,665
hammock and fall 15 feet to the ground.

3074
02:18:34,665 --> 02:18:37,804
TRAVIS: (pained groan)

3075
02:18:37,804 --> 02:18:41,672
MATT: But you manage to make your way up there and
just bear hug the tree trunk for rest. You're used

3076
02:18:41,672 --> 02:18:43,106
to sleeping in uncomfortable situations.

3077
02:18:43,106 --> 02:18:45,901
LIAM: I throw five or six pine cones at his head.

3078
02:18:45,901 --> 02:18:48,342
MATT: Over time, or at once?

3079
02:18:48,342 --> 02:18:49,515
LIAM: At once.

3080
02:18:49,515 --> 02:18:54,908
TRAVIS: Fucking gravity.

3081
02:18:54,908 --> 02:19:01,608
MATT: You manage to complete three pieces of
parchment, roughly page-sized, with your black

3082
02:19:01,608 --> 02:19:08,350
powder treatment, successfully. The mist rolls in
and gets thicker and thicker, to the point where

3083
02:19:08,350 --> 02:19:14,927
you cannot see the floor of the forest. The little
bit of moonlight that manages to make its way

3084
02:19:14,927 --> 02:19:21,757
through the boughs of the trees trickles through
and then vanishes into these slowly-shifting bits

3085
02:19:21,816 --> 02:19:27,594
of fog. Your breath, every time you exhale, is
visible, as the cold night air begins to take. You

3086
02:19:27,594 --> 02:19:31,936
find yourselves instinctively shivering, as you
cannot grow close to each other for heat, nor

3087
02:19:31,936 --> 02:19:38,576
build a fire. The night, while uncomfortable, you
do manage to get an evening's bit of

3088
02:19:38,576 --> 02:19:44,934
mostly uncomfortable rest, but rest nonetheless.
Eventually coming to as the morning sun comes up

3089
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:51,775
and heats it up, the fog begins to fade away and
burn away. You're at about an hour past sunrise as

3090
02:19:51,775 --> 02:19:57,163
you all unrestfully come to consciousness as the
temperature shift hits. You manage to relieve

3091
02:19:57,163 --> 02:20:06,533
yourselves of your spider silk-based hammocks
and/or tree grasping. Both you and Trinket have

3092
02:20:06,533 --> 02:20:13,368
found this way of clutching onto the tree.
Trinket's used to the wild.

3093
02:20:13,368 --> 02:20:14,759
TRAVIS: This is, like, sunup, right?

3094
02:20:14,759 --> 02:20:16,720
MATT: It's about seven, 7:30 in the morning.

3095
02:20:16,720 --> 02:20:22,385
SAM: Can I do a quick scry back to the poo jar
that I left back in our kitchen?

3096
02:20:22,385 --> 02:20:23,522
MATT: Certainly.

3097
02:20:23,522 --> 02:20:25,199
SAM: Just to make sure that our home base is
okay.

3098
02:20:25,199 --> 02:20:29,130
MATT: You take a moment and concentrate on the
kitchen. At this point in time, you can see early

3099
02:20:29,130 --> 02:20:38,629
morning. Laina is currently in there, yawning, and is
cleaning about and starting to make a small

3100
02:20:38,713 --> 02:20:43,529
breakfast for all the guards. You can hear in the
distance, some conversation in the distant room.

3101
02:20:43,529 --> 02:20:47,695
It appears to be a couple of your various employed
mercenaries

3102
02:20:47,695 --> 02:20:50,726
having a conversation as she's making breakfast.

3103
02:20:50,726 --> 02:20:51,657
SAM: So they're fine.

3104
02:20:51,657 --> 02:20:52,577
MATT: They seem fine.

3105
02:20:52,577 --> 02:20:56,004
SAM: So I knock that one off, and I'll try for
Pike.

3106
02:20:56,004 --> 02:21:00,540
MATT: Okay. Concentrating on Pike-- about two
minutes of hard concentration.

3107
02:21:00,540 --> 02:21:02,845
There's no connection.

3108
02:21:02,845 --> 02:21:05,186
SAM: They wiped my poo away.

3109
02:21:05,186 --> 02:21:10,532
MATT: You gather, due to the relatively fresh and
unstable nature of this potion you had concocted,

3110
02:21:10,532 --> 02:21:16,836
you can only have one source connection up at a
time, so when you left it in your keep, it seems

3111
02:21:16,836 --> 02:21:22,762
that the one you had at the temple of Sarenrae was
alleviated of its magical presence. What was once

3112
02:21:22,762 --> 02:21:27,981
a magical scry poo is literally just Scan-scat at
the temple.

3113
02:21:27,981 --> 02:21:30,556
SAM: Which some could argue is magical in its own
right.

3114
02:21:30,556 --> 02:21:32,438
MATT: Sure enough. With a high enough persuasion
roll.

3115
02:21:32,438 --> 02:21:33,807
LAURA: Teacher. Teacher.

3116
02:21:33,807 --> 02:21:35,822
TALIESIN: Does it change color when it loses its
power?

3117
02:21:35,822 --> 02:21:36,685
MATT: You don't know.

3118
02:21:36,685 --> 02:21:38,457
TALIESIN: Damn it! I want to know.

3119
02:21:38,457 --> 02:21:39,834
SAM: Only one way to find out.

3120
02:21:39,834 --> 02:21:40,821
TALIESIN: God damn it.

3121
02:21:40,821 --> 02:21:43,229
MATT: Ask Pike when you see her again. (laughs)

3122
02:21:43,229 --> 02:21:48,863
TALIESIN: Your poo power may come in very handy.
This is good to know.

3123
02:21:48,863 --> 02:21:52,865
TRAVIS: Let's go find an abandoned building and
set up.

3124
02:21:52,865 --> 02:21:55,955
LIAM: Could we throw in a Scanlan grenade and be
able to see through it?

3125
02:21:55,955 --> 02:21:58,053
SAM: Sure.

3126
02:21:58,053 --> 02:21:59,619
TALIESIN: A scat grenade.

3127
02:21:59,619 --> 02:22:00,762
LIAM: A scat grenade.

3128
02:22:00,762 --> 02:22:01,540
SAM: Sure.

3129
02:22:01,540 --> 02:22:02,330
LIAM: Scatlan.

3130
02:22:02,330 --> 02:22:03,975
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Scatlan!

3131
02:22:03,975 --> 02:22:06,820
SAM: I could get in, shit in their bedroom, and
leave.

3132
02:22:06,820 --> 02:22:08,536
LIAM: You shit in your hand, and you toss it.

3133
02:22:08,536 --> 02:22:10,909
SAM: Oh, yeah. That, too! Pull the pin.

3134
02:22:10,909 --> 02:22:17,158
(all laugh)

3135
02:22:17,158 --> 02:22:19,088
LAURA: Yeah. Remember that. That's awesome.

3136
02:22:19,088 --> 02:22:21,225
TRAVIS: This is what happens.

3137
02:22:21,225 --> 02:22:22,962
LAURA: You could fly overhead with Keyleth.

3138
02:22:22,962 --> 02:22:23,847
SAM: Yes?

3139
02:22:23,847 --> 02:22:25,611
LAURA: Drop it like a bomb!

3140
02:22:25,611 --> 02:22:27,819
SAM: And then we'd have eyes in there.

3141
02:22:27,819 --> 02:22:29,674
LAURA: I like it.

3142
02:22:29,674 --> 02:22:32,277
SAM: I like this a lot. Give me something to eat.

3143
02:22:32,277 --> 02:22:34,659
MARISHA: What?

3144
02:22:34,659 --> 02:22:36,068
SAM: I need some fuel.

3145
02:22:36,068 --> 02:22:37,102
TRAVIS: Holy crap.

3146
02:22:37,102 --> 02:22:38,314
LAURA: I have a sweet potato right here, Scanlan.

3147
02:22:38,314 --> 02:22:41,703
SAM: Sweet potato? That's good, yes. Some prunes?

3148
02:22:41,703 --> 02:22:43,470
MARISHA: Yeah, something hearty.

3149
02:22:43,470 --> 02:22:45,069
LIAM: All right. We're off the rails.

3150
02:22:45,069 --> 02:22:47,207
TRAVIS: Step one of this.

3151
02:22:47,207 --> 02:22:54,161
MATT: So, you make your way down into the forest.
About another hour and a half of travel before you

3152
02:22:54,161 --> 02:22:59,896
start getting to where the trees begin to clear up
a little bit, and you can see the base of the

3153
02:22:59,896 --> 02:23:08,158
cleared-off mountain that Whitestone Castle is built
upon, and the pathway that descends into the outer

3154
02:23:08,232 --> 02:23:11,557
wall of the city of Whitestone.

3155
02:23:11,557 --> 02:23:14,385
LAURA: How far of a travel is it down into the
city?

3156
02:23:14,385 --> 02:23:19,103
MATT: It's maybe a quarter mile.

3157
02:23:19,103 --> 02:23:21,591
LAURA: So we can do that a little amount of time.

3158
02:23:21,591 --> 02:23:24,485
MATT: Space-relation-wise, you guys are just
getting to this side of the forest right there.

3159
02:23:24,485 --> 02:23:29,487
Right there, and this is the mountain.

3160
02:23:29,487 --> 02:23:32,122
LAURA: So if we're going to try stealth this shit
in--

3161
02:23:32,122 --> 02:23:33,676
TRAVIS: Do we take the stealthy one or the
invisible one?

3162
02:23:33,676 --> 02:23:34,485
SAM: Wait.

3163
02:23:34,485 --> 02:23:38,250
MARISHA: Wait. Wait. Which plan are we doing
first?

3164
02:23:38,250 --> 02:23:39,942
TRAVIS: First part is getting an abandoned
building.

3165
02:23:39,942 --> 02:23:42,135
LAURA: So that we can be near the tree to protect
you.

3166
02:23:42,135 --> 02:23:43,697
SAM: So that we can be townspeople.

3167
02:23:43,697 --> 02:23:44,610
MARISHA: Okay.

3168
02:23:44,610 --> 02:23:45,828
SAM: Right?

3169
02:23:45,828 --> 02:23:46,984
TALIESIN: So you can get a beret.

3170
02:23:46,984 --> 02:23:48,438
TRAVIS: Abandoned building, part one.

3171
02:23:48,438 --> 02:23:49,818
SAM: We're setting up shop.

3172
02:23:49,818 --> 02:23:51,242
LAURA: Get into the town.

3173
02:23:51,242 --> 02:23:53,421
TRAVIS: So who goes and finds the abandoned
building?

3174
02:23:53,421 --> 02:23:55,054
SAM: Percy is known here.

3175
02:23:55,054 --> 02:24:00,089
TALIESIN: Which is why I'm going to be wearing-- I
haven't been seen in years, and when I was seen, I

3176
02:24:00,089 --> 02:24:02,898
was much younger, and honestly--

3177
02:24:02,898 --> 02:24:05,307
MARISHA: Yes, but the Briarwoods knew who you
were.

3178
02:24:05,307 --> 02:24:07,358
TALIESIN: I had different hair. Yes, they do.

3179
02:24:07,358 --> 02:24:08,487
MARISHA: The Briarwoods recognized you instantly.

3180
02:24:08,487 --> 02:24:10,797
TALIESIN: They did, which was disorienting.

3181
02:24:10,797 --> 02:24:12,556
SAM: But they're not on sentry duty.

3182
02:24:12,556 --> 02:24:15,212
TRAVIS: We need a forward operating base, so who
wants to be stealthy or invisible

3183
02:24:15,274 --> 02:24:16,591
and find an empty building?

3184
02:24:16,591 --> 02:24:24,014
LIAM: Question: for the Assassin path of rogue, at
9th level, if I have seven days, which is way too

3185
02:24:24,014 --> 02:24:31,607
much time, I can impersonate anyone I want. In
half a day, could I just be a dirty nobody?

3186
02:24:31,607 --> 02:24:33,858
MATT: Yeah. You'd be able to disguise yourself.

3187
02:24:33,858 --> 02:24:35,137
SAM: We also have the hat.

3188
02:24:35,137 --> 02:24:36,097
MATT: The disguise kit?

3189
02:24:36,097 --> 02:24:40,740
SAM: His hat of disguise. Percy knows this town.
Perhaps Percy should wear the hat.

3190
02:24:40,805 --> 02:24:42,593
TRAVIS: Does it require attunement?

3191
02:24:42,593 --> 02:24:43,812
SAM: Just a few minutes, I think.

3192
02:24:43,812 --> 02:24:45,315
TALIESIN: I already have the hat.

3193
02:24:45,315 --> 02:24:47,474
SAM: Yes, you had it from the dinner party.

3194
02:24:47,474 --> 02:24:54,613
TALIESIN: I've been trying to think of what sorts
of buildings would be the most defensible and the

3195
02:24:54,613 --> 02:25:00,828
least likely to arouse suspicion. Things with
basements?

3196
02:25:00,828 --> 02:25:08,272
MATT: A lot of the houses have basements. There
are varying degrees of it. There are larger

3197
02:25:08,272 --> 02:25:14,426
homesteads that were reserved for the actual
nobles that ran the day-to-day life of Whitestone

3198
02:25:14,426 --> 02:25:20,359
when your family was in power. As you heard from
Desmond, probably the places where the new nobles

3199
02:25:20,359 --> 02:25:25,222
live. Those are the ones that have the gates
surrounding them: the larger homesteads scattered

3200
02:25:25,222 --> 02:25:26,396
throughout the town.

3201
02:25:26,396 --> 02:25:27,533
TALIESIN: That's too obvious.

3202
02:25:27,533 --> 02:25:32,008
MATT: It's far too obvious. There are many small
abodes and even some farm-based hovels. The poor

3203
02:25:32,008 --> 02:25:37,602
end of town is the farming side, which is the
southwest, which is the closest area to where you

3204
02:25:37,602 --> 02:25:40,472
guys made your stop earlier.

3205
02:25:40,472 --> 02:25:44,416
TALIESIN: I would almost say a shopping district.
If there's an abandoned storefront.

3206
02:25:44,416 --> 02:25:48,357
MATT: The shopping district is the center of town
around the town square.

3207
02:25:48,357 --> 02:25:49,756
LAURA: Around the Sun Tree?

3208
02:25:49,756 --> 02:25:52,074
MATT: Yeah. Right there.

3209
02:25:52,074 --> 02:25:54,729
TALIESIN: Might be too close.

3210
02:25:54,729 --> 02:26:03,218
SAM: Before we go marching in there, finding an
abode to live in is not going to be too difficult.

3211
02:26:03,218 --> 02:26:05,649
We'll need food.

3212
02:26:05,649 --> 02:26:07,425
LAURA: Are we living in there?!

3213
02:26:07,425 --> 02:26:08,467
SAM: Yes.

3214
02:26:08,467 --> 02:26:09,728
TALIESIN: We're not going to be there for long.

3215
02:26:09,728 --> 02:26:10,917
TRAVIS: We have dried food rations.

3216
02:26:10,917 --> 02:26:12,434
TALIESIN: We have food rations. We have options.

3217
02:26:12,434 --> 02:26:14,927
LAURA: We've got food for days.

3218
02:26:14,927 --> 02:26:16,294
SAM: We might be there for days and days.

3219
02:26:16,294 --> 02:26:17,254
LAURA: We've got food for days.

3220
02:26:17,254 --> 02:26:18,394
TRAVIS: We've got dried food rations.

3221
02:26:18,394 --> 02:26:23,875
SAM: We also have to go around town and, forgive
me if I'm going too far with your plan here, but

3222
02:26:23,875 --> 02:26:26,886
aren't we trying to win allies among the people?

3223
02:26:26,886 --> 02:26:28,281
TALIESIN: I have a plan.

3224
02:26:28,281 --> 02:26:30,762
SAM: But we'll need to communicate with them.
How?

3225
02:26:30,762 --> 02:26:31,460
LAURA: He has a plan.

3226
02:26:31,460 --> 02:26:32,598
TRAVIS: He has a plan.

3227
02:26:32,598 --> 02:26:34,230
SAM: (sighs) All right.

3228
02:26:34,230 --> 02:26:36,990
TRAVIS: Come on. Drop your pants and get with the
plan.

3229
02:26:36,990 --> 02:26:39,176
MARISHA: What time is it? Have we gone to sleep,
or are we waking up?

3230
02:26:39,176 --> 02:26:43,530
MATT: You guys are awake. After this discussion,
I'd say it's about 8:00 in the morning. 8:30.

3231
02:26:43,530 --> 02:26:44,778
TALIESIN: Let's make our way in.

3232
02:26:44,778 --> 02:26:45,597
LIAM: This is the time.

3233
02:26:45,597 --> 02:26:46,604
LAURA: We should stealth in.

3234
02:26:46,604 --> 02:26:47,865
MARISHA: Are we doing the tree thing right now?

3235
02:26:47,865 --> 02:26:50,296
MATT: Actually, your travel to the city and you're
on the outskirts of it now.

3236
02:26:50,296 --> 02:26:51,820
It would be closer to 9:30.

3237
02:26:51,820 --> 02:26:53,442
MARISHA: Okay.

3238
02:26:53,442 --> 02:26:55,040
LAURA: Yeah. We try to get in.

3239
02:26:55,040 --> 02:26:59,529
TALIESIN: We find a place to at least set up our
operation.

3240
02:26:59,529 --> 02:27:03,237
MARISHA: Well, that's what I was going to say. Do
we want to find operations, try and recoup--

3241
02:27:03,237 --> 02:27:06,897
LIAM: We don't really know what we're going to
find this morning. Those big guys could still be

3242
02:27:06,897 --> 02:27:08,119
there; we don't know.

3243
02:27:08,119 --> 02:27:09,245
TALIESIN: We don't.

3244
02:27:09,245 --> 02:27:12,787
LIAM: We don't know if there are people in the
pocket of the Briarwoods here.

3245
02:27:12,787 --> 02:27:14,561
TRAVIS: It's like 12% of a plan.

3246
02:27:14,561 --> 02:27:18,402
MARISHA: If we take a day to get in and get
settled, I can do a Heroes' Feast and then I start

3247
02:27:18,402 --> 02:27:20,720
crack of dawn in the morning?

3248
02:27:20,720 --> 02:27:22,332
LIAM: I think that's a good idea.

3249
02:27:22,332 --> 02:27:23,951
TALIESIN: Let's get in and set up.

3250
02:27:23,951 --> 02:27:26,848
LIAM: Hole up. Let's find a place.

3251
02:27:26,848 --> 02:27:28,413
MARISHA: All right.

3252
02:27:28,413 --> 02:27:30,843
SAM: Wait, we're just going to walk into the
city?

3253
02:27:30,843 --> 02:27:32,394
TALIESIN: No, we're going to stealth into the
city.

3254
02:27:32,394 --> 02:27:33,170
SAM: Okay.

3255
02:27:33,170 --> 02:27:34,681
LAURA: We're going to cast Pass Without a Trace on
everybody.

3256
02:27:34,681 --> 02:27:35,755
MATT: Okay.

3257
02:27:35,755 --> 02:27:37,887
SAM: Beard check?

3258
02:27:37,887 --> 02:27:39,040
TRAVIS: That was an eight.

3259
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:40,613
MATT: Stealth?

3260
02:27:40,613 --> 02:27:42,243
TRAVIS: Beard check.

3261
02:27:42,301 --> 02:27:50,034
MATT: Oh. (laughs) Your beard is pretty much at
the fullest it'll ever be. You gather you can

3262
02:27:50,034 --> 02:27:53,944
probably get a little more thickness to it, but
your beard is at maximum, Grog. The fact that you

3263
02:27:53,944 --> 02:27:56,906
even have a goliath with a beard is a feat of
magic in its own right.

3264
02:27:56,906 --> 02:27:57,967
TRAVIS: Amazing.

3265
02:27:57,967 --> 02:27:59,085
LIAM: You would be a freak.

3266
02:27:59,085 --> 02:28:01,824
TRAVIS: Is it like that Vidal Sassoon commercial?
Whip it.

3267
02:28:01,824 --> 02:28:02,733
MARISHA: That's dope.

3268
02:28:02,733 --> 02:28:03,797
TALIESIN: Isn't that dope?

3269
02:28:03,797 --> 02:28:08,475
SAM: Grog, I've heard that no one in this town
wears a beard.

3270
02:28:08,475 --> 02:28:10,392
LAURA: Oh, natural 20 on stealth!

3271
02:28:10,392 --> 02:28:14,019
TRAVIS: You can forget it. I won't go in.

3272
02:28:14,019 --> 02:28:17,652
MATT: So you guys are traveling as a group. I need
stealth checks from everybody.

3273
02:28:17,652 --> 02:28:21,781
TALIESIN: Do we have Pass Without a Trace?

3274
02:28:21,781 --> 02:28:22,789
LAURA: Yeah.

3275
02:28:22,789 --> 02:28:24,989
MARISHA: Can we each take a little bit of time to
look more like commoners?

3276
02:28:24,989 --> 02:28:26,179
TALIESIN: I'm wearing my hat, too.

3277
02:28:26,179 --> 02:28:28,442
TRAVIS: Look like commoners?

3278
02:28:28,442 --> 02:28:30,084
SAM: I rub dirt all over my face.

3279
02:28:30,084 --> 02:28:32,331
TRAVIS: Shit, I'm a goliath.

3280
02:28:32,331 --> 02:28:33,425
LAURA: Plus, we have a bear.

3281
02:28:33,425 --> 02:28:35,140
SAM: You should try to look less handsome.

3282
02:28:35,140 --> 02:28:37,907
MARISHA: Yeah, we do look like quite the motley
crew.

3283
02:28:37,907 --> 02:28:39,371
LIAM: I'm wearing a natural 20.

3284
02:28:39,371 --> 02:28:40,335
SAM: Okay.

3285
02:28:40,335 --> 02:28:42,640
MATT: Did you roll a natural 20, as well?

3286
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:43,524
LIAM: I did.

3287
02:28:43,524 --> 02:28:44,862
MATT: Both of you guys rolled natural 20s in
stealth?

3288
02:28:44,862 --> 02:28:47,491
LIAM: Had a little help with Luck, but I got it.

3289
02:28:47,551 --> 02:28:48,988
MATT: There you go.

3290
02:28:48,988 --> 02:28:50,365
TALIESIN: That's really good, because I rolled a
one.

3291
02:28:50,365 --> 02:28:51,679
LAURA: Oh no.

3292
02:28:51,679 --> 02:28:53,736
SAM: We've got Pass Without a Trace, so 28.

3293
02:28:53,736 --> 02:28:55,023
TALIESIN: 11.

3294
02:28:55,023 --> 02:28:55,899
MARISHA: Still a failure.

3295
02:28:55,899 --> 02:28:57,560
TRAVIS: Are we all going together? Are we not
sending one person in

3296
02:28:57,560 --> 02:28:59,355
to go find an empty building?

3297
02:28:59,355 --> 02:29:00,817
SAM: We're all going together.

3298
02:29:00,817 --> 02:29:04,750
MATT: You guys are all going together. You dirty
yourselves up a bit. You're still a large goliath.

3299
02:29:04,750 --> 02:29:07,284
You're still a few half-elves, a gnome.

3300
02:29:07,284 --> 02:29:08,612
LAURA: There's still a bear.

3301
02:29:08,612 --> 02:29:11,136
MATT: Outside of illusion magic, you're still
going to stick out like a sore thumb.

3302
02:29:11,136 --> 02:29:12,561
LAURA: Could we cast illusion magic? Do we have
it?

3303
02:29:12,561 --> 02:29:13,988
SAM: What's illusion magic?

3304
02:29:13,988 --> 02:29:16,660
LIAM: I'm walking 50 feet in front of everybody
else.

3305
02:29:16,660 --> 02:29:18,407
LAURA: Seeming! To make Grog and Trinket look like
commoners.

3306
02:29:18,407 --> 02:29:20,491
LIAM: I'm 50 feet in front of everyone else.

3307
02:29:20,491 --> 02:29:21,515
LAURA: Yeah, do that!

3308
02:29:21,515 --> 02:29:23,316
MARISHA: Oh, yeah! Seeming us?

3309
02:29:23,316 --> 02:29:26,129
SAM: Sure. All right. I will cast Seeming on us.

3310
02:29:26,129 --> 02:29:29,239
MATT: This is a legit use of Seeming, too. Okay.

3311
02:29:29,239 --> 02:29:31,111
SAM: We'll all look like dirty--

3312
02:29:31,111 --> 02:29:34,024
MARISHA: As opposed to the cows? Come on.

3313
02:29:34,024 --> 02:29:36,101
SAM: -- dirty, ragged peasants.

3314
02:29:36,101 --> 02:29:37,250
MATT: Trinket, as well?

3315
02:29:37,250 --> 02:29:37,972
LAURA: Yes.

3316
02:29:37,972 --> 02:29:39,541
TALIESIN: Trinket looks like a donkey.

3317
02:29:39,541 --> 02:29:40,909
LAURA: No, he'll just be a really drunk peasant.

3318
02:29:40,909 --> 02:29:42,751
MARISHA: A donkey. A mule.

3319
02:29:42,751 --> 02:29:45,231
SAM: Can I just say this? Can we just leave
Trinket behind--

3320
02:29:45,231 --> 02:29:46,250
LAURA: No!

3321
02:29:46,250 --> 02:29:48,616
SAM: I don't want to walk in there with a bear!

3322
02:29:48,616 --> 02:29:51,619
LAURA: He'll look like a fucking donkey, or he'll
look like another commoner.

3323
02:29:51,619 --> 02:29:54,055
SAM: I think I can only make us all look the
same.

3324
02:29:54,055 --> 02:29:55,494
LAURA: Then he'll look like a fucking commoner.

3325
02:29:55,494 --> 02:30:00,826
MATT: Of similar size. I believe, as far as
Seeming is concerned-- If not, then I'll allow it

3326
02:30:00,826 --> 02:30:01,937
for the purposes of this.

3327
02:30:01,937 --> 02:30:02,865
LAURA: He'll look like a commoner--

3328
02:30:02,865 --> 02:30:03,311
MARISHA: A Clydesdale!

3329
02:30:03,311 --> 02:30:04,690
LAURA: -- a weird commoner.

3330
02:30:04,690 --> 02:30:05,482
TRAVIS: Leave the bear.

3331
02:30:05,482 --> 02:30:06,444
TALIESIN: A milk cow!

3332
02:30:06,444 --> 02:30:09,481
LAURA: I'm not leaving a fucking bear on the
outside of town where there's hounds around, and

3333
02:30:09,481 --> 02:30:12,186
there's fucking vampires and birds flying around,
fuck you!

3334
02:30:12,186 --> 02:30:15,122
SAM: Oh, wait, no! You can give each target a new
appearance.

3335
02:30:15,122 --> 02:30:16,358
MATT: Yep!

3336
02:30:16,358 --> 02:30:18,241
SAM: So I can make everyone look a little
different.

3337
02:30:18,241 --> 02:30:21,603
MATT: Each creature can seem a foot shorter or
taller, or appear thin, fat, or in between.

3338
02:30:21,603 --> 02:30:23,294
MARISHA: Make him look like a milk cow.

3339
02:30:23,294 --> 02:30:26,489
MATT: You can't change their body type. So,
Trinket will still be a four-legged creature, but

3340
02:30:26,489 --> 02:30:28,257
you can make him look like a different four-legged
creature.

3341
02:30:28,257 --> 02:30:29,284
LAURA: There you go!

3342
02:30:29,284 --> 02:30:30,363
SAM: Okay. He's a milk cow.

3343
02:30:30,363 --> 02:30:33,685
LIAM: Real talk, real talk, Scanlan. My sister
will cut you.

3344
02:30:33,685 --> 02:30:36,432
TRAVIS: Or do you want him to be a donkey,
something we can move.

3345
02:30:36,432 --> 02:30:37,326
Milk cows are slow.

3346
02:30:37,326 --> 02:30:37,989
LIAM: Bring the bear.

3347
02:30:37,989 --> 02:30:38,541
TALIESIN: Donkeys can move more quickly. This is
true.

3348
02:30:38,735 --> 02:30:39,927
SAM: All right. Donkey.

3349
02:30:39,927 --> 02:30:40,660
LAURA: All right.

3350
02:30:40,660 --> 02:30:41,728
SAM: He's an ass.

3351
02:30:41,728 --> 02:30:42,875
MATT: All right, so Trinket takes on the form of a
donkey.

3352
02:30:42,875 --> 02:30:44,154
LAURA: (laughs) So are you darling, so are you.

3353
02:30:44,154 --> 02:30:45,447
TRAVIS: Just like her owner.

3354
02:30:45,447 --> 02:30:47,649
MATT: The rest of you are a smattering of various
humanoids, you--

3355
02:30:47,649 --> 02:30:49,098
LAURA: (fake coughing)

3356
02:30:49,098 --> 02:30:52,653
SAM: I make myself look like a weird hunchback,
sort of, not all there.

3357
02:30:52,653 --> 02:30:57,481
MATT: Okay, so you guys look like pretty
rough peasants, dirty faces. You know, hair a

3358
02:30:57,560 --> 02:31:03,542
little razzled. It looks like you've been living
the harsh life on the outskirts of the slums of

3359
02:31:03,542 --> 02:31:05,045
Whitestone for quite some time--

3360
02:31:05,045 --> 02:31:06,329
TRAVIS: I wanted to be a model.

3361
02:31:06,329 --> 02:31:08,125
MATT: -- with a donkey.

3362
02:31:08,125 --> 02:31:09,900
TALIESIN: (goat bleat)

3363
02:31:09,900 --> 02:31:14,799
MATT: So. You guys, utilizing your stealth checks
and the Seeming, you make your way up to the--

3364
02:31:14,799 --> 02:31:16,212
which side of Whitestone are you coming in from?

3365
02:31:16,212 --> 02:31:17,591
TALIESIN: Thank you for the double 20.

3366
02:31:17,591 --> 02:31:18,396
MATT: Percy?

3367
02:31:18,396 --> 02:31:19,148
LAURA: Where are we coming up?

3368
02:31:19,148 --> 02:31:20,098
TALIESIN: Coming in from the west.

3369
02:31:20,098 --> 02:31:23,764
MATT: Okay, so you come into this entrance here.
You make your way into the center of town,

3370
02:31:23,764 --> 02:31:32,893
blending in best you can. There are a few folks
who see you enter, just give you a strange look.

3371
02:31:32,893 --> 02:31:43,262
You all are unfamiliar to the denizens of
Whitestone--

3372
02:31:43,262 --> 02:31:44,299
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

3373
02:31:44,299 --> 02:31:49,354
MATT: -- but you don't look like a threat, per se.
So you are noticed, and some people seem to just

3374
02:31:49,354 --> 02:31:54,897
stop and watch you pass, but no one seems to make
any active mention, note,

3375
02:31:54,897 --> 02:31:56,821
or change in behavior towards it.

3376
02:31:56,821 --> 02:31:58,753
TRAVIS: Are we checking buildings while we're
walking through?

3377
02:31:58,753 --> 02:32:01,705
LAURA: I have passive perception of 21; I'm always
looking.

3378
02:32:01,705 --> 02:32:10,118
LIAM: I walk over to just one random person on the
street and say, anyone hiring hands? On farms?

3379
02:32:10,118 --> 02:32:11,861
LAURA: Our farm burned down!

3380
02:32:11,861 --> 02:32:20,022
MATT: (laughs) Make a deception roll. I'll give
you advantage on it because the Seeming does give

3381
02:32:20,022 --> 02:32:25,162
you the visual perspective of being close to their
type.

3382
02:32:25,162 --> 02:32:29,086
LIAM: That is a four-- No, hold on--

3383
02:32:29,086 --> 02:32:30,010
LAURA: No, no, no.

3384
02:32:30,010 --> 02:32:31,293
LIAM: I'm gonna use Luck, that's the Luck.

3385
02:32:31,293 --> 02:32:32,427
TRAVIS: Was the first number gonna be a 40?

3386
02:32:32,427 --> 02:32:35,820
LIAM: No, it's not 40. So it's 14.

3387
02:32:35,820 --> 02:32:37,623
MATT: Okay. That's two Luck rolls, by the way,
that you've spent.

3388
02:32:37,623 --> 02:32:39,224
LIAM: Yeah, I know.

3389
02:32:39,224 --> 02:32:47,510
MATT: The woman you approach who's probably in her
early 30s, pale blonde hair, looks like she

3390
02:32:47,510 --> 02:32:51,661
actually might be losing it in some places, gives
you a look and goes,

3391
02:32:51,661 --> 02:32:56,056
"You poor people shouldn't be here."

3392
02:32:56,056 --> 02:32:58,456
LIAM: We just need some work.

3393
02:32:58,456 --> 02:33:04,958
MATT: "You'll find it, but you're not going
anywhere else. Welcome to Whitestone." She turns

3394
02:33:04,958 --> 02:33:11,291
around and walks back, joining arms with
apparently a man that she's paired with, and the

3395
02:33:11,291 --> 02:33:18,458
two of them just walk away, a bit dumbfounded that
people walked into Whitestone. As this happens,

3396
02:33:18,458 --> 02:33:24,960
you glance over your shoulder and you see coming
from the northern edge from this side wall--

3397
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:28,465
(sounds of booming footsteps)

3398
02:33:28,465 --> 02:33:30,097
LAURA: Oh, we should avoid that shit!

3399
02:33:30,097 --> 02:33:37,627
MATT: A very tall, noticeably undead giant with
its jaw broken off and hanging from the hinge,

3400
02:33:37,627 --> 02:33:43,120
dried, caked blood across its chest, it's just
dragging this large club behind it.

3401
02:33:43,120 --> 02:33:45,187
LIAM: Where are we? What are our surroundings
right now?

3402
02:33:45,187 --> 02:33:49,406
MATT: You right now, you're in a T. To the right
and left are roads that go along the inside of the

3403
02:33:49,406 --> 02:33:54,054
wall that surrounds Whitestone, to the front of
you is the path that leads further into the city.

3404
02:33:54,054 --> 02:33:55,156
LAURA: Let's go into the city!

3405
02:33:55,156 --> 02:33:55,916
TRAVIS: We casually begin--

3406
02:33:55,916 --> 02:34:00,063
TALIESIN: I wanna head through the city, possibly
in the direction of the cemetery.

3407
02:34:00,063 --> 02:34:02,048
MATT: Cemetery's over here.

3408
02:34:02,048 --> 02:34:03,350
TALIESIN: Yeah, I wanna head in that direction.

3409
02:34:03,350 --> 02:34:05,033
MATT: All right. So you guys make your way
through--

3410
02:34:05,033 --> 02:34:08,354
LAURA: Keeping an eye out for, you know, buildings
that look clustered

3411
02:34:08,354 --> 02:34:10,355
and abandoned that we can hide in.

3412
02:34:10,355 --> 02:34:11,895
TALIESIN: What's changed?

3413
02:34:11,895 --> 02:34:21,078
MATT: What you've noticed has changed is, one:
largely, the population is far more sparse than

3414
02:34:21,078 --> 02:34:25,524
you recall. What was once a bustling city, you're now
seeing about half as many people as you would

3415
02:34:25,524 --> 02:34:31,046
would see this time of day. Going through,
everyone seems to be in relatively poor health.

3416
02:34:31,125 --> 02:34:43,236
There are a few buildings that look long-term
abandoned, immediately in this area here, in the

3417
02:34:43,236 --> 02:34:49,574
outskirts, catches your guys' eye. You do notice
that the corner lamps that you had set up at the

3418
02:34:49,574 --> 02:34:55,101
different corners of the streets appear to be
shattered.

3419
02:34:56,701 --> 02:34:57,819
TRAVIS: Interesting.

3420
02:34:57,819 --> 02:35:04,048
MATT: There would be like, you know, glass oil
lanterns that at night someone would go around and

3421
02:35:04,048 --> 02:35:10,690
light them after the sunset. The posts that hold
them now are all either broken, or the glass

3422
02:35:10,766 --> 02:35:14,264
itself has been shattered.

3423
02:35:16,465 --> 02:35:18,960
MARISHA: They want it to be really dark.

3424
02:35:18,960 --> 02:35:22,701
TALIESIN: They want it to be really dark. I'm also
thinking about that cemetery.

3425
02:35:22,701 --> 02:35:27,447
SAM: We're not gonna live in a cemetery, that's
super creepy.

3426
02:35:27,447 --> 02:35:30,834
MARISHA: As opposed to all of the other things
we've done?

3427
02:35:30,962 --> 02:35:32,350
TALIESIN: Everything here is super creepy.

3428
02:35:32,350 --> 02:35:34,907
LAURA: Is there any other abandoned buildings
around?

3429
02:35:34,907 --> 02:35:36,371
MARISHA: As opposed to sleeping in the Underdark?

3430
02:35:36,371 --> 02:35:39,913
MATT: There are plenty of buildings that look dark
and mostly untouched in this section here, as you

3431
02:35:39,913 --> 02:35:41,431
begin to move closer and closer inward.

3432
02:35:41,431 --> 02:35:45,823
TALIESIN: Let's get east of the center square and
set up camp.

3433
02:35:45,823 --> 02:35:47,882
LAURA: Okay. Where's the castle? Is it on the top
of the--

3434
02:35:47,882 --> 02:35:48,810
TRAVIS: It's north.

3435
02:35:48,810 --> 02:35:51,001
LAURA: Oh, it's that thingy? Okay.

3436
02:35:51,001 --> 02:35:52,393
SAM: We're trying to shoot for here?

3437
02:35:52,393 --> 02:36:03,704
MATT: Okay. You guys move this way, as you push
towards the center of this here. You--

3438
02:36:05,378 --> 02:36:06,899
SAM: You speak Giant, Grog?

3439
02:36:06,899 --> 02:36:07,982
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3440
02:36:07,982 --> 02:36:11,540
MATT: You move past the center here and to the
left of you, you can see the town square and there

3441
02:36:11,540 --> 02:36:19,044
it is, the Sun Tree. Very, very large, you imagine
beautiful tree at one time, full height was

3442
02:36:19,044 --> 02:36:28,393
probably about 40 feet tall. The branches twist
out, and almost look like they're hanging loosely,

3443
02:36:28,393 --> 02:36:31,994
the ends, everything looks droopy and desolate;
there's not a leaf on it.

3444
02:36:31,994 --> 02:36:35,046
MARISHA: Can I do some sort of a check from a
distance to see if I can recognize

3445
02:36:35,046 --> 02:36:37,480
what kind of tree it is?

3446
02:36:37,480 --> 02:36:39,947
MATT: Make a nature check.

3447
02:36:41,249 --> 02:36:42,494
MARISHA: 18.

3448
02:36:42,494 --> 02:36:47,941
MATT: Okay. It's hard to tell from this distance,
there are a number of types of trees it could be.

3449
02:36:47,941 --> 02:36:52,900
It's not indigenous to this land. The fact that it
grew here means that either it was transplanted,

3450
02:36:52,900 --> 02:36:55,415
or it was some sort of--

3451
02:36:55,415 --> 02:36:56,235
MARISHA: Magical grower.

3452
02:36:56,235 --> 02:36:57,483
LAURA: (sings) Divine Intervention!

3453
02:36:57,483 --> 02:36:59,374
MATT: -- magical creation for its presence.

3454
02:36:59,374 --> 02:37:01,634
MARISHA: Okay.

3455
02:37:01,634 --> 02:37:08,718
MATT: And you do see the silhouette of the eight
figures slowly swaying from beneath the branches.

3456
02:37:08,718 --> 02:37:13,958
TRAVIS: We continue on. Don't pay too much
attention to it. Find a place to post up.

3457
02:37:13,958 --> 02:37:15,437
MARISHA: Right. Don't get emotional.

3458
02:37:15,437 --> 02:37:21,424
LAURA: If you, if you do your nature-y spell from
inside a building, does it still do the same thing

3459
02:37:21,424 --> 02:37:23,327
or do you have to be next to the tree while you're
doing it?

3460
02:37:23,327 --> 02:37:25,521
TRAVIS: That's a large radius, right?

3461
02:37:25,521 --> 02:37:30,722
MARISHA: So the way the spell works, I can do it
one of two ways. I can do it instantaneously,

3462
02:37:30,722 --> 02:37:38,750
essentially grow up a whole bunch of plants and
brush and shrubbery around me, or I can wait and I

3463
02:37:38,750 --> 02:37:43,615
can concentrate for a while and instill a plant
with vibrant--

3464
02:37:43,615 --> 02:37:44,732
LAURA: Okay.

3465
02:37:44,732 --> 02:37:49,366
MARISHA: -- life energy and heal the farmlands and
it would stretch out for a really far radius.

3466
02:37:49,366 --> 02:37:50,350
LAURA: Let's keep moving.

3467
02:37:50,350 --> 02:37:51,827
MARISHA: I'm gonna probably wanna do more the
second one.

3468
02:37:51,827 --> 02:37:52,478
LAURA: Okay.

3469
02:37:52,478 --> 02:37:53,473
TRAVIS: Do it from inside a house.

3470
02:37:53,473 --> 02:37:56,405
MATT: Did you guys want keep moving down this
path, to go through the square, closer to the

3471
02:37:56,405 --> 02:37:57,911
tree, do you want to go southward?

3472
02:37:57,911 --> 02:37:59,130
MARISHA: I don't know, it's a central point.

3473
02:37:59,130 --> 02:38:00,256
LAURA: We avoid the tree a little bit and just
keep going straight.

3474
02:38:00,256 --> 02:38:01,240
MATT: Okay, so you're going this way.

3475
02:38:01,240 --> 02:38:02,089
LAURA: Yeah?

3476
02:38:02,089 --> 02:38:04,599
LIAM: There's a larger building, isn't there? I
can't see--

3477
02:38:04,599 --> 02:38:09,520
TALIESIN: Actually, I would say let's get a good
look at the tree, let's walk by it.

3478
02:38:09,520 --> 02:38:11,815
SAM: Oh, we're gonna walk by the tree?

3479
02:38:11,815 --> 02:38:16,057
MARISHA: Look like it's no big deal.

3480
02:38:16,057 --> 02:38:17,202
TRAVIS: I know.

3481
02:38:17,202 --> 02:38:21,822
MATT: You guys turn left, and you make your way
towards the town square. And as you enter the

3482
02:38:21,822 --> 02:38:31,200
square, looking around, you can see there are what
would have been carts and small booths set up for

3483
02:38:31,200 --> 02:38:39,051
selling of meats and other goods, what was a
small, you know, barter-and-sale based hub of this

3484
02:38:39,051 --> 02:38:43,427
town-- nowhere near on the scale of Emon's bazaar,
but you know, enough to support this town--

3485
02:38:43,427 --> 02:38:54,918
desolate. All look to be closed down and untouched
for quite some time. As you get a closer look to

3486
02:38:54,918 --> 02:38:58,439
the-- actually I'm gonna have you guys all roll
perception checks.

3487
02:38:58,439 --> 02:39:05,245
You're not getting too close to the tree.

3488
02:39:05,245 --> 02:39:06,194
TRAVIS: Five.

3489
02:39:06,194 --> 02:39:06,945
SAM: Nine.

3490
02:39:06,945 --> 02:39:08,395
LIAM: 26.

3491
02:39:08,395 --> 02:39:11,500
LAURA: 19. No, that's a-- yeah, 19.

3492
02:39:11,500 --> 02:39:12,487
MARISHA: 14.

3493
02:39:12,487 --> 02:39:13,602
TALIESIN: 23.

3494
02:39:13,602 --> 02:39:17,604
MATT: As you guys are keeping on the outskirts of
the square, it's hard to make out the details, and

3495
02:39:17,604 --> 02:39:24,948
the weathering has muddled the figures that are
hanging there. Percy and Vax, you guys notice the

3496
02:39:24,948 --> 02:39:26,430
figure on the far left--

3497
02:39:26,430 --> 02:39:29,019
LIAM: The body.

3498
02:39:29,019 --> 02:39:38,600
MATT: The body on the far left has red paint
smattered across its face and its arms. It's

3499
02:39:38,600 --> 02:39:46,881
wearing a dirtied, green, vest-like robe that
dangles below it as it hangs there, loosely.

3500
02:39:46,881 --> 02:39:53,829
Immediately to the left of it you see what looks
to be the body of a child. The child is dressed up

3501
02:39:53,829 --> 02:40:03,316
in a purplish, billowing shirt, very fine silk
shirt and pantaloons, and is dangling there next

3502
02:40:03,316 --> 02:40:12,452
to it. To the left of that you see what appears to be a
female, adorned in greens and browns, looks like

3503
02:40:12,532 --> 02:40:18,050
red paint has been driven through the hair, and
dangles to the left of that figure. Next to that,

3504
02:40:18,050 --> 02:40:19,324
you see what appears to be--

3505
02:40:19,324 --> 02:40:21,134
TALIESIN: I am walking the fuck away.

3506
02:40:21,134 --> 02:40:26,724
MATT: -- you see what appears to be another woman,
dressed in dark blacks and browns, leathers, some

3507
02:40:26,724 --> 02:40:32,362
furs across the top, dark hair, dangling. To the
left of that you see another man dressed

3508
02:40:32,421 --> 02:40:38,723
similarly, dark greys and blacks, long dark hair,
dangling. To the left of that you see a rather

3509
02:40:38,723 --> 02:40:45,226
large man, older, rotund, probably in his forties,
clothing padded but mostly open chest, hair

3510
02:40:45,226 --> 02:40:51,810
completely shaven bald, it looks like there are
dark scars placed across the face, hanging. To the

3511
02:40:51,810 --> 02:40:56,222
left of that you see, this figure is actually not
humanoid, you see what appears to have been--

3512
02:40:56,222 --> 02:40:57,497
MARISHA: Oh my god.

3513
02:40:57,497 --> 02:41:01,162
MATT: -- a recently hunted bear, who is dangling.

3514
02:41:01,162 --> 02:41:03,947
MARISHA: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3515
02:41:03,947 --> 02:41:07,147
SAM: Wait, what? Is that us?

3516
02:41:07,147 --> 02:41:09,985
MARISHA: It looks like us.

3517
02:41:09,985 --> 02:41:11,837
TRAVIS: What?

3518
02:41:11,837 --> 02:41:12,919
MARISHA: It's us!

3519
02:41:12,919 --> 02:41:17,108
SAM: They killed people they thought were us, or
they killed--

3520
02:41:17,108 --> 02:41:18,618
LIAM: Or it's a message.

3521
02:41:18,618 --> 02:41:21,778
SAM: Or it's a message to us.

3522
02:41:21,778 --> 02:41:28,358
MARISHA: Do they look like us or were they just
dressed like us? Are they made to look like us?

3523
02:41:28,358 --> 02:41:29,993
MATT: Do you want to get closer and look?

3524
02:41:29,993 --> 02:41:30,819
MARISHA: Yeah.

3525
02:41:30,819 --> 02:41:32,287
TALIESIN: I'm a little curious--

3526
02:41:32,287 --> 02:41:34,823
TRAVIS: Do you want to get closer and look? Are
you sure--

3527
02:41:34,823 --> 02:41:36,771
TALIESIN: Is there anything around the tree other
than us?

3528
02:41:36,771 --> 02:41:37,990
TRAVIS: They're probably watching the tree.

3529
02:41:37,990 --> 02:41:40,665
TALIESIN: Is there something at the base of the
tree, is there anything?

3530
02:41:40,665 --> 02:41:47,725
MATT: From what you can see now, nothing but just
rocks and stones and piles of loose cloth rotting

3531
02:41:47,725 --> 02:41:55,664
below it. Approaching, it looks like each one of
these bodies has been dressed up. It looks like

3532
02:41:55,664 --> 02:42:02,755
the color in the redhead's hair has been smeared
through with paint. It looks like the person who

3533
02:42:02,755 --> 02:42:09,957
has been painted red has been slapdash. You gather
with a moment of looking at it that these were not

3534
02:42:09,957 --> 02:42:15,265
individuals that were caught this way. This was
set up as a message.

3535
02:42:15,265 --> 02:42:16,736
LAURA: (whispers) My god.

3536
02:42:16,736 --> 02:42:18,061
SAM: Oh shit.

3537
02:42:18,061 --> 02:42:19,182
LAURA: Keep walking, keep your head down and keep
walking.

3538
02:42:19,182 --> 02:42:20,130
MARISHA: Oh, my god.

3539
02:42:20,130 --> 02:42:21,103
TRAVIS: I don't think they're here.

3540
02:42:21,103 --> 02:42:22,165
MARISHA: Oh, my god.

3541
02:42:22,165 --> 02:42:23,495
TRAVIS: I don't think they're here.

3542
02:42:23,495 --> 02:42:25,065
SAM: You mean in town? Of course they are!

3543
02:42:25,065 --> 02:42:29,053
TRAVIS: No, remember they have to, like, be where
the soil they came from is?

3544
02:42:29,053 --> 02:42:31,712
LAURA: No, they have, like hideouts, they don't
have to be where the soil they came from is.

3545
02:42:31,712 --> 02:42:33,246
TRAVIS: I don't think they're here.

3546
02:42:33,246 --> 02:42:34,212
SAM: Holy shit.

3547
02:42:34,212 --> 02:42:36,653
LIAM: They're in their keep, buried deep.

3548
02:42:36,653 --> 02:42:38,271
TRAVIS: Okay.

3549
02:42:38,271 --> 02:42:47,603
MATT: You guys continue past, down this pathway.
There's other buildings you see in the vicinity

3550
02:42:47,603 --> 02:42:54,867
that, you know, look abandoned or for the most
part unoccupied. I'd say about one in every three

3551
02:42:54,867 --> 02:42:56,838
buildings looks like it's in disuse.

3552
02:42:56,838 --> 02:43:01,232
LIAM: Did we see this big building right here as
we walked by? Yeah, that big one.

3553
02:43:01,232 --> 02:43:04,138
MATT: You guys came-- made this path-- you can see
a little bit, you can see is a--

3554
02:43:04,138 --> 02:43:05,449
TALIESIN: I should know what it is, anyway.

3555
02:43:05,449 --> 02:43:08,481
MATT: -- iron fence, it used to belong to one of
the noble families of Whitestone. Each one of

3556
02:43:08,481 --> 02:43:11,462
these large buildings here, these three, and you
remember this, were

3557
02:43:11,462 --> 02:43:14,418
the three families that ran the town.

3558
02:43:14,418 --> 02:43:16,672
TALIESIN: We can't go anywhere near those
buildings.

3559
02:43:16,672 --> 02:43:19,760
We have to stay as far away as humanly possible.

3560
02:43:19,760 --> 02:43:21,809
MARISHA: Question. You said there were eight
bodies?

3561
02:43:21,809 --> 02:43:23,546
MATT: Eight bodies.

3562
02:43:23,546 --> 02:43:28,407
MARISHA: Is there one that looks like a gnome
cleric and

3563
02:43:28,407 --> 02:43:31,537
one that looks like a dragonborn sorcerer?

3564
02:43:31,537 --> 02:43:32,662
LAURA: That was the first one.

3565
02:43:32,662 --> 02:43:34,024
MATT and TRAVIS: The one's painted all red--

3566
02:43:34,024 --> 02:43:35,417
LAURA: There wasn't a gnome cleric one there.

3567
02:43:35,417 --> 02:43:38,432
MATT: No. There was a bear.

3568
02:43:38,432 --> 02:43:45,997
LIAM: There was no cleric when we faced them
before. All of us who stood against them in Emon.

3569
02:43:45,997 --> 02:43:47,190
TRAVIS: We're all there.

3570
02:43:47,190 --> 02:43:51,311
SAM: Body of my guy. Is he sort of handsome?

3571
02:43:51,311 --> 02:43:54,507
MARISHA: But, it does mean that it was because of
when they saw us in Emon--

3572
02:43:54,507 --> 02:43:55,659
MATT: Think of an eight-year-old child.

3573
02:43:55,659 --> 02:43:56,622
LAURA: It was a kid, yo.

3574
02:43:56,622 --> 02:43:57,646
SAM: Oh, it was a child? Oh, god.

3575
02:43:57,646 --> 02:43:59,598
MARISHA: -- because Tiberius wasn't here with the
crows.

3576
02:43:59,598 --> 02:44:01,074
TRAVIS: No, it was because of Emon.

3577
02:44:01,074 --> 02:44:02,461
MARISHA: It was because of Emon.

3578
02:44:02,461 --> 02:44:03,292
LAURA: Yeah.

3579
02:44:03,292 --> 02:44:08,454
MARISHA: So, can we get like a vague idea of how
long these people

3580
02:44:08,454 --> 02:44:10,981
look like they might have been here?

3581
02:44:10,981 --> 02:44:12,545
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3582
02:44:12,545 --> 02:44:14,801
MARISHA: (whispers) Fuck, I'm not good at this
shit.

3583
02:44:14,801 --> 02:44:15,944
TALIESIN: Can I help?

3584
02:44:15,944 --> 02:44:17,789
MATT: Sure. It would be advantage on that check
for you.

3585
02:44:17,789 --> 02:44:20,874
MARISHA: Oh, that, you know, that wasn't bad.
Woo!

3586
02:44:20,874 --> 02:44:22,162
TALIESIN: Oh! Never mind.

3587
02:44:22,162 --> 02:44:23,643
MARISHA: I'll take that 19, 21?

3588
02:44:23,643 --> 02:44:31,301
MATT: 21? You gather these bodies have probably
been here for the better part of a week, week and

3589
02:44:31,301 --> 02:44:37,841
a half? There is some mild decomposition starting
to settle in, there is a bit of bloating to some

3590
02:44:37,841 --> 02:44:41,301
of them. Couldn't have been much longer than
that.

3591
02:44:41,301 --> 02:44:43,745
SAM: A week? That's before we set out.

3592
02:44:43,745 --> 02:44:46,444
MARISHA: Why would they put a warning for us here
in the city?

3593
02:44:46,444 --> 02:44:48,684
SAM: They assumed we would come, but they don't
know that we're here.

3594
02:44:48,684 --> 02:44:50,290
TALIESIN: They invited us.

3595
02:44:50,290 --> 02:44:53,348
LIAM: Those birds might have told them we were
here.

3596
02:44:53,348 --> 02:44:55,803
SAM: This was a week ago, this was before we were
even close.

3597
02:44:55,803 --> 02:44:57,237
TRAVIS: Let's stick with the plan.

3598
02:44:57,237 --> 02:44:58,905
TALIESIN: Sticking with the plan.

3599
02:44:58,905 --> 02:45:00,079
SAM: Let's go find a building.

3600
02:45:00,079 --> 02:45:02,981
TALIESIN: Going to go find something that's a
decent distance away from the three noble

3601
02:45:02,981 --> 02:45:06,623
households, that has a reasonable view of the
tree.

3602
02:45:06,623 --> 02:45:08,368
TRAVIS: Yeah, 150 feet from the tree.

3603
02:45:08,368 --> 02:45:10,040
MATT: That would probably be somewhere in this
vicinity here,

3604
02:45:10,040 --> 02:45:11,884
as the three main houses are right there.

3605
02:45:11,884 --> 02:45:15,802
TALIESIN: Something with a second-floor view, but
with some distance.

3606
02:45:15,802 --> 02:45:18,111
TRAVIS: Preferably three bedroom, three bath.

3607
02:45:18,111 --> 02:45:23,328
MATT: (laughs) I'd say make an investigation
check.

3608
02:45:26,764 --> 02:45:28,266
TALIESIN: Meh. Six.

3609
02:45:28,266 --> 02:45:31,591
LAURA: Can I look out too, I've been on the
lookout for a building the whole time!

3610
02:45:31,591 --> 02:45:36,230
MATT: Yeah. I'll say, I'll say it takes the better
part of the next hour or so, and you do a little

3611
02:45:36,230 --> 02:45:39,990
bit of meandering to find it, you guys are being
stealthy best you can through alleys and such, but

3612
02:45:39,990 --> 02:45:44,669
even so you are out in the open, midday, but you
are also, you know, under Seeming.

3613
02:45:44,669 --> 02:45:52,527
MARISHA: Does it look like there's a covering
nearby, roughly, 30 feet or so from the tree?

3614
02:45:52,527 --> 02:45:54,110
LAURA: 30 feet?!

3615
02:45:54,110 --> 02:45:55,247
SAM: 30 feet?

3616
02:45:55,247 --> 02:45:56,038
MATT: No.

3617
02:45:56,038 --> 02:45:57,042
SAM: What about 150?

3618
02:45:57,042 --> 02:46:00,287
MATT: No, the tree is out in the center, and
essentially the nearest building is probably

3619
02:46:00,287 --> 02:46:07,817
anywhere from 100, 200 feet away from it. It's the
tree out in the middle of the square, and the

3620
02:46:07,817 --> 02:46:11,822
square, which used to have probably more things
towards the center, more temporary establishments,

3621
02:46:11,822 --> 02:46:14,518
have all been put to the sides and put to disuse.

3622
02:46:14,518 --> 02:46:17,722
SAM: Maybe underground stuff.

3623
02:46:17,722 --> 02:46:22,601
MATT: You do manage to see what appear to be what
was once a tavern or an inn of some kind that is

3624
02:46:22,601 --> 02:46:28,589
silent, closed, the doors locked and chained. The
windows look dusty.

3625
02:46:28,589 --> 02:46:31,692
LAURA: Can we sneak in the windows, so it keeps
chained?

3626
02:46:31,692 --> 02:46:34,879
MATT: Okay. You go around the side of it, to the
alley.

3627
02:46:34,879 --> 02:46:36,406
TALIESIN: Dust of tracelessness.

3628
02:46:36,406 --> 02:46:37,648
LAURA: Yeah, Dust of tracelessness.

3629
02:46:37,648 --> 02:46:38,815
SAM: Are you guys going in?

3630
02:46:38,815 --> 02:46:39,317
LIAM: Yeah.

3631
02:46:39,317 --> 02:46:39,827
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3632
02:46:39,827 --> 02:46:40,373
LAURA: Yeah.

3633
02:46:40,373 --> 02:46:41,401
TALIESIN: This is where we're going to hole up.

3634
02:46:41,401 --> 02:46:42,460
MATT: Okay.

3635
02:46:42,460 --> 02:46:43,652
MARISHA: I kind of want to talk to the tree.

3636
02:46:43,652 --> 02:46:44,595
LAURA: Then go talk to the tree, Keyleth.

3637
02:46:44,595 --> 02:46:45,277
MATT: The window is locked.

3638
02:46:45,277 --> 02:46:46,109
SAM: Wait, not now. Not now.

3639
02:46:46,109 --> 02:46:47,036
TRAVIS: No, no, no, no, no, not yet.

3640
02:46:47,036 --> 02:46:47,835
SAM: Let's find a place first.

3641
02:46:47,835 --> 02:46:48,697
TRAVIS: Let's post up first.

3642
02:46:48,697 --> 02:46:50,989
LIAM: What am I, stealthing right now, or checking
for--

3643
02:46:50,989 --> 02:46:52,875
MATT: Continuing your guys' stealth as your going,
this would be

3644
02:46:52,875 --> 02:46:54,699
your attempting to unlock the window.

3645
02:46:54,699 --> 02:46:56,626
LIAM: Oh, unlock, okay. So that's a 22.

3646
02:46:56,626 --> 02:47:00,207
MATT: 22, okay. It takes a bit to jostle it in a
way, because the lock is on the inside, but there

3647
02:47:00,288 --> 02:47:04,488
are ways that you could shimmy the glass and get
something underneath to push it aside. You manage

3648
02:47:04,488 --> 02:47:10,066
to get the window open, and as you pull it up the
dust billows up around you, you set it aside. You

3649
02:47:10,132 --> 02:47:20,361
step in and the place smells stale, musty. Dark.
There are, you can see, candlesticks set around

3650
02:47:20,361 --> 02:47:25,046
that have not been lit for a while, and the oil
lanterns that normally light the interior of the

3651
02:47:25,046 --> 02:47:30,117
main tavern social area have been long in disuse.

3652
02:47:30,117 --> 02:47:32,394
LAURA: Is there a cellar here?

3653
02:47:32,394 --> 02:47:35,082
MATT: If you guys want to look around. Are you all
going in?

3654
02:47:35,082 --> 02:47:36,129
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're all going in.

3655
02:47:36,129 --> 02:47:37,171
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're all going in.

3656
02:47:37,171 --> 02:47:38,479
MATT: You as well? Or are you talking to the
tree?

3657
02:47:38,479 --> 02:47:39,154
SAM: Yes.

3658
02:47:39,154 --> 02:47:40,103
TRAVIS: Come inside.

3659
02:47:40,103 --> 02:47:40,867
MARISHA: Does anyone want to come talk to a tree
with me?

3660
02:47:40,867 --> 02:47:41,597
TALIESIN: Not yet.

3661
02:47:41,597 --> 02:47:42,444
LAURA: Not yet, not just yet.

3662
02:47:42,444 --> 02:47:43,280
TRAVIS: Don't bring that-- don't mess with that
thing.

3663
02:47:43,280 --> 02:47:44,419
LIAM: Yeah, come with us. Keyleth, come with us.

3664
02:47:44,419 --> 02:47:45,411
MARISHA: All right, all right.

3665
02:47:45,411 --> 02:47:46,346
TRAVIS: Once we do it, it's like ringing a dinner
bell.

3666
02:47:46,346 --> 02:47:48,753
MARISHA: All right, all right, all right, I'm
coming, I'm coming.

3667
02:47:48,753 --> 02:47:50,561
SAM: I'm gonna look for a brothel!

3668
02:47:50,561 --> 02:47:51,755
(all laugh)

3669
02:47:51,755 --> 02:47:53,415
TALIESIN: That's going to be the saddest brothel.

3670
02:47:53,415 --> 02:47:54,542
MARISHA: The saddest brothel!

3671
02:47:54,542 --> 02:48:01,495
MATT: You find your way inside the abandoned
tavern. And it is what was this giant L-shaped

3672
02:48:01,495 --> 02:48:07,942
building, right here in the corner of the town
square. There is a second floor, approximately

3673
02:48:07,942 --> 02:48:16,057
runs 20 rooms. They are all currently unlocked,
some of them left open, the bedding covered in

3674
02:48:16,057 --> 02:48:18,430
dust, some of it looks like it was left in a
hurry.

3675
02:48:18,430 --> 02:48:20,443
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll take it.

3676
02:48:20,443 --> 02:48:22,427
MATT: There is a cellar.

3677
02:48:22,427 --> 02:48:23,543
LAURA: Yeah.

3678
02:48:23,543 --> 02:48:30,298
MATT: You find the cellar, and down there, there
are a number of empty barrels, and a couple of

3679
02:48:30,298 --> 02:48:31,805
ones that are still full.

3680
02:48:31,805 --> 02:48:32,725
SAM: Ooh!

3681
02:48:32,725 --> 02:48:37,353
MATT: One that appears to be a heavy whiskey
barrel, probably about twenty untouched wine

3682
02:48:37,353 --> 02:48:45,314
bottles. A little bit of ale, but it looks like a
lot of ale was either completely used, or taken

3683
02:48:45,314 --> 02:48:47,802
with whoever left and abandoned the premises.

3684
02:48:47,802 --> 02:48:50,140
LAURA: I think we can definitely use these for
explosions, if we need them.

3685
02:48:50,140 --> 02:48:51,234
MARISHA: Ooh!

3686
02:48:51,234 --> 02:48:53,047
SAM: Or to drink.

3687
02:48:53,047 --> 02:48:56,865
TALIESIN: Muscle relaxers. Is there a view of the
tree?

3688
02:48:56,865 --> 02:49:03,171
MATT: Going from a number of the rooms up top, not
every room has a window, but it's like every third

3689
02:49:03,171 --> 02:49:10,684
room on that side of the building does have a view
of the entire square.

3690
02:49:10,684 --> 02:49:13,937
MARISHA: Can I get an eye as to how far away it
is?

3691
02:49:13,937 --> 02:49:20,845
MATT: I'd say probably about 200 feet? 250 feet?

3692
02:49:20,845 --> 02:49:23,750
LAURA: Can you go invisible and still talk to the
tree?

3693
02:49:23,750 --> 02:49:24,728
MARISHA: Hmm?

3694
02:49:24,728 --> 02:49:25,990
SAM: I can make her invisible if she can talk to
the tree.

3695
02:49:25,990 --> 02:49:27,424
LAURA: Can you talk to the tree if you're
invisible?

3696
02:49:27,424 --> 02:49:29,644
MATT: If you cast a spell while invisible, unless
it's Greater Invisibility,

3697
02:49:29,644 --> 02:49:31,629
then it will drop the illusion.

3698
02:49:31,629 --> 02:49:32,877
SAM: I can make her invisible.

3699
02:49:32,877 --> 02:49:34,182
MARISHA: I got an idea.

3700
02:49:34,182 --> 02:49:35,544
SAM: We can burrow under, we can--

3701
02:49:35,544 --> 02:49:36,381
LAURA: Yeah.

3702
02:49:36,381 --> 02:49:39,606
SAM: -- find something closer.

3703
02:49:39,606 --> 02:49:42,945
MARISHA: Actually, what are we up to right now?
Are we doing anything? Are we busy?

3704
02:49:42,945 --> 02:49:46,100
SAM: Well, there are windows on the first floor,
right?

3705
02:49:46,100 --> 02:49:48,180
MATT: There are some windows in the tavern; there
was one on the second floor.

3706
02:49:48,180 --> 02:49:50,304
LAURA: We're in the cellar, that's why I went to
the cellar.

3707
02:49:50,304 --> 02:49:51,493
MARISHA: Oh, there's a cellar?

3708
02:49:51,493 --> 02:49:54,671
SAM: I'm gonna just find some old rags, or
anything I can find, tablecloths,

3709
02:49:54,671 --> 02:49:58,437
and just cover the windows.

3710
02:49:58,437 --> 02:50:01,762
LAURA: But make it not obvious, because it doesn't
want to look like we covered the windows.

3711
02:50:01,762 --> 02:50:03,165
SAM: True.

3712
02:50:03,165 --> 02:50:08,627
LIAM: I've watched you pass through solid stone
and earth. How long can you do that for?

3713
02:50:08,627 --> 02:50:12,783
MARISHA: I mean, I can burrow us a tunnel right
now.

3714
02:50:12,783 --> 02:50:13,708
LAURA: Do it!

3715
02:50:13,708 --> 02:50:16,011
LIAM: Can you get us close to underneath the
tree?

3716
02:50:16,011 --> 02:50:17,540
LAURA: That's what she's going to do.

3717
02:50:17,540 --> 02:50:20,769
MARISHA: I'm going to do it right now. I'm going
to cast Move Earth.

3718
02:50:20,769 --> 02:50:22,167
LAURA: From the cellar.

3719
02:50:22,167 --> 02:50:25,184
MATT: You're going to start carving a tunnel--

3720
02:50:25,184 --> 02:50:31,049
MARISHA: To the direction of the tree. And I want
to be careful, I don't want to damage the roots of

3721
02:50:31,049 --> 02:50:35,070
the tree at all. So, as I start getting closer, I want
to start looking for the roots of the tree.

3722
02:50:35,145 --> 02:50:43,455
MATT: Okay. Easy enough to find old rags; all of
them have that stale, musty towel scent to them.

3723
02:50:43,530 --> 02:50:48,526
You get them a little wet. There's no water here;
all the water here has dried out.

3724
02:50:48,526 --> 02:50:49,802
SAM: We use the wine.

3725
02:50:49,802 --> 02:50:52,362
MATT: You'll have to use the wine; it'll probably
kill some of the bacteria. There are wells

3726
02:50:52,362 --> 02:50:56,299
throughout the towns you see, ground wells that
are set in the city. There is no nearby river. The

3727
02:50:56,299 --> 02:50:59,607
closest river, the one you know about, is about a
30 minute walk south.

3728
02:50:59,607 --> 02:51:00,834
TALIESIN: It's a bit of a ways.

3729
02:51:00,834 --> 02:51:06,800
MATT: Yeah. You use that to coax them out a bit.
It's easy enough for you to go around and put

3730
02:51:06,800 --> 02:51:11,050
cloth over the windows. It's a dark interior, so
it's not like an immediate--

3731
02:51:11,050 --> 02:51:13,250
TALIESIN: Just so light doesn't leak out.

3732
02:51:13,250 --> 02:51:22,091
LIAM: But, just in case, I think I'll hang back.
I'm not going down to the pre-made tunnel, I'll

3733
02:51:22,091 --> 02:51:24,072
just keep an eye above ground.

3734
02:51:24,072 --> 02:51:25,670
TRAVIS: I am, too, I'm staying up in the tavern.

3735
02:51:25,670 --> 02:51:27,094
LAURA: I'm going with you to the tunnel.

3736
02:51:27,094 --> 02:51:30,077
TALIESIN: I'm going to tinker a little thing. Can
I borrow an arrow?

3737
02:51:30,077 --> 02:51:31,130
LAURA: Yes.

3738
02:51:31,130 --> 02:51:34,220
TALIESIN: Thank you. I'm going to tinker a very
little, easy thing.

3739
02:51:34,220 --> 02:51:35,923
TRAVIS: You want the top floor, I'll take the
bottom floor.

3740
02:51:35,923 --> 02:51:45,965
TALIESIN: I want to be able to fire and ignite one
of the parchments on an arrow. So that I can--

3741
02:51:45,965 --> 02:51:48,180
LAURA: Do you want me to shoot the arrow for you?

3742
02:51:48,180 --> 02:51:52,664
TALIESIN: -- set a burn mark at a distance.

3743
02:51:53,570 --> 02:51:55,368
MATT: Interesting. Okay.

3744
02:51:55,368 --> 02:52:01,991
TALIESIN: It would be a spark, as opposed to
actual flame. It would just be concussive force.

3745
02:52:01,991 --> 02:52:05,701
MATT: Right, it's more getting the parchment there
without it tearing or the arrow leaving it behind,

3746
02:52:05,701 --> 02:52:07,484
because it is a thin, flimsy piece.

3747
02:52:07,484 --> 02:52:09,298
TALIESIN: It would be coiled.

3748
02:52:09,298 --> 02:52:11,015
MATT: Coiled and then--

3749
02:52:11,015 --> 02:52:13,033
TALIESIN: Hit, release.

3750
02:52:13,033 --> 02:52:18,118
MATT: That's going to be a really intricate-- go
ahead and roll a tinkerer's check.

3751
02:52:18,118 --> 02:52:20,601
LIAM: 20, 20, 20.

3752
02:52:21,883 --> 02:52:23,661
TALIESIN: 16.

3753
02:52:23,661 --> 02:52:29,414
MATT: Okay. You toy with it for a while; you think
you have something that may work. You're uncertain

3754
02:52:29,414 --> 02:52:35,150
as to on its release if it'll function or not. So,
write down 'Parchment Delivery Arrow' with a

3755
02:52:35,150 --> 02:52:37,528
question mark next to it.

3756
02:52:37,528 --> 02:52:38,911
SAM: Maybe there's a simpler way.

3757
02:52:38,911 --> 02:52:41,248
TALIESIN: There might be, but just in case there's
not, I want to make sure this works.

3758
02:52:41,248 --> 02:52:44,637
MARISHA: You could always slap it up there 
and shoot it with a flame arrow.

3759
02:52:44,698 --> 02:52:48,849
TALIESIN: I've got three of them, so I've got
options. But I just want to make sure--

3760
02:52:48,849 --> 02:52:51,960
MARISHA: How's my burrowing going? 200 feet.

3761
02:52:51,960 --> 02:53:00,292
MATT: All right. You continue to burrow through
the ground, moving the earth aside and the tunnel

3762
02:53:00,292 --> 02:53:07,763
opens before you like the clay slowly melting
away. And it is wet earth. Eventually, you start

3763
02:53:07,825 --> 02:53:13,313
getting to a few thick roots under the tree.

3764
02:53:13,313 --> 02:53:15,525
LAURA: Can you talk to it from here, Keyleth?

3765
02:53:15,525 --> 02:53:20,269
MATT: The roots that you see, they continue past
the tunnel. They go very,

3766
02:53:20,269 --> 02:53:22,585
very deep into the ground.

3767
02:53:22,585 --> 02:53:28,331
MARISHA: Awesome. I'm going to clear out a little
more area, and I'm going to touch the roots and

3768
02:53:28,331 --> 02:53:30,658
cast Speak with Plants.

3769
02:53:30,658 --> 02:53:32,833
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

3770
02:53:32,833 --> 02:53:34,026
SAM: Speak with Plants?

3771
02:53:34,026 --> 02:53:35,249
LIAM: Haroom haroom.

3772
02:53:35,249 --> 02:53:36,518
TALIESIN: The only superpower more pathetic than
Aquaman's.

3773
02:53:36,518 --> 02:53:37,646
LAURA: Yeah.

3774
02:53:37,646 --> 02:53:38,427
MARISHA: Shut up.

3775
02:53:38,427 --> 02:53:39,212
TALIESIN: Sorry, had to.

3776
02:53:39,212 --> 02:53:41,104
LAURA: (kid's voice) Gee wiz, I wish I had some
water.

3777
02:53:41,104 --> 02:53:44,452
MARISHA: (kid's voice) The sun is so bright
today!

3778
02:53:44,452 --> 02:53:47,710
LAURA: Too bad we don't have Tiberius with us with
his endless water fucking pitcher.

3779
02:53:47,710 --> 02:53:50,526
LIAM: It's Ent voice. Haroom haroom!

3780
02:53:50,526 --> 02:53:50,776
TALIESIN: Hi, Aquaman.

3781
02:53:50,776 --> 02:53:52,015
LAURA: Sure, sure, sure.

3782
02:53:52,015 --> 02:53:52,900
TALIESIN: Hi, Aquaman.

3783
02:53:52,900 --> 02:53:54,776
SAM: I can go to one of the wells and get some
water.

3784
02:53:54,776 --> 02:53:55,584
TALIESIN: Hi, Aquaman.

3785
02:53:55,584 --> 02:53:56,332
MARISHA: Hey, he's cool sometimes.

3786
02:53:56,332 --> 02:53:57,112
TALIESIN: Hi, Aquaman.

3787
02:53:57,112 --> 02:53:57,873
MARISHA: Sometimes.

3788
02:53:57,873 --> 02:53:59,152
TALIESIN: It's what fish say. Hi, Aquaman.

3789
02:53:59,152 --> 02:54:00,761
MARISHA: That's what fish say.

3790
02:54:00,761 --> 02:54:03,267
LIAM: That's all they say.

3791
02:54:03,267 --> 02:54:04,514
TALIESIN: Hi, Aquaman.

3792
02:54:04,514 --> 02:54:10,831
MATT: You finish the spell and you reach out and
you touch the root and you instill the force of

3793
02:54:10,831 --> 02:54:19,202
your nature-based divine energies into the root.
Silence.

3794
02:54:19,202 --> 02:54:21,572
SAM: Oh no.

3795
02:54:21,572 --> 02:54:22,827
MATT: This tree is dead.

3796
02:54:22,827 --> 02:54:23,583
TRAVIS: No!

3797
02:54:23,583 --> 02:54:24,970
SAM: Dead?!

3798
02:54:24,970 --> 02:54:26,327
LAURA: You can bring it back!

3799
02:54:26,327 --> 02:54:28,164
MARISHA: I can bring it back. Should I?

3800
02:54:28,164 --> 02:54:30,265
SAM: You can do that?

3801
02:54:30,265 --> 02:54:32,781
MARISHA: I'm a druid, that's my-- yeah man!

3802
02:54:32,781 --> 02:54:35,235
SAM: You can bring dead things back?

3803
02:54:35,235 --> 02:54:37,209
MARISHA: Yeah, it's called Plant Growth!

3804
02:54:37,209 --> 02:54:37,920
SAM: What?!

3805
02:54:37,920 --> 02:54:38,635
MARISHA: Yeah!

3806
02:54:38,635 --> 02:54:39,632
SAM: This I gotta see.

3807
02:54:39,632 --> 02:54:43,249
MARISHA: Should I? Okay. But it's dead. What time
is it now?

3808
02:54:43,440 --> 02:54:48,699
MATT: Right now, with all the traveling you guys
have done, I'd say it's past noon, probably.

3809
02:54:48,699 --> 02:54:52,615
Including the time you've spent inside the tavern,
searching it through and preparing it

3810
02:54:52,615 --> 02:54:55,084
as your base of operations.

3811
02:54:55,084 --> 02:54:55,857
LAURA: Try it.

3812
02:54:55,857 --> 02:54:56,843
MARISHA: Should I start it up now?

3813
02:54:56,843 --> 02:54:57,478
SAM: Yeah!

3814
02:54:57,478 --> 02:54:58,674
LIAM, LAURA, and TRAVIS: Go for it!

3815
02:54:58,674 --> 02:55:04,062
MARISHA: I'm going to start my Plant Growth. I'm
going to drop. Can I try to clear out an area

3816
02:55:04,062 --> 02:55:07,562
where I can-- I should be fine.

3817
02:55:07,562 --> 02:55:09,016
LAURA: Reach up in its junk.

3818
02:55:09,016 --> 02:55:10,976
TALIESIN: Put your hand in it.

3819
02:55:10,976 --> 02:55:14,228
MARISHA: I'm going to strap on my gloves.

3820
02:55:14,228 --> 02:55:15,770
TRAVIS: Okay.

3821
02:55:15,770 --> 02:55:19,697
LIAM: Turn and cough.

3822
02:55:19,697 --> 02:55:23,186
MARISHA: Hope you guys are ready for this.

3823
02:55:23,186 --> 02:55:24,265
SAM: Is it going to be loud?

3824
02:55:24,265 --> 02:55:25,688
MARISHA: No, it's just going to take a long time.

3825
02:55:25,688 --> 02:55:27,682
TRAVIS: Vax and I are guarding the tavern, so if
anything comes--

3826
02:55:27,682 --> 02:55:30,624
SAM: I'm going to get provisions ready to
spoon-feed her.

3827
02:55:30,624 --> 02:55:34,709
MARISHA: Actually, before I do that, can we all
have one last meal together

3828
02:55:34,709 --> 02:55:36,925
and eat a Heroes' Feast?

3829
02:55:36,925 --> 02:55:37,838
LAURA: I like it.

3830
02:55:37,838 --> 02:55:38,798
TALIESIN: Yes.

3831
02:55:38,798 --> 02:55:39,693
MATT: Certainly.

3832
02:55:39,693 --> 02:55:41,080
TALIESIN: Let's eat.

3833
02:55:41,080 --> 02:55:46,637
MATT: So, you've made the purchase within Emon for
how many of the

3834
02:55:46,637 --> 02:55:50,598
requisite chalice for the Heroes' Feast?

3835
02:55:50,738 --> 02:55:53,107
MARISHA: How many did I buy?

3836
02:55:53,107 --> 02:55:55,461
TALIESIN: You have at least one.

3837
02:55:55,461 --> 02:56:00,996
MARISHA: It gets used. It's expensive.

3838
02:56:00,996 --> 02:56:02,315
LAURA: It's $1000.

3839
02:56:02,315 --> 02:56:03,235
MARISHA: It's $1000.

3840
02:56:03,235 --> 02:56:08,030
MATT: It's a gem-encrusted bowl worth 1000 gold
pieces, which the spell consumes. So, we'll say

3841
02:56:08,030 --> 02:56:12,643
how many of those did you purchase in Emon,
knowing you'd be casting this in the future?

3842
02:56:13,136 --> 02:56:15,451
MARISHA: How much gold do we have?

3843
02:56:15,451 --> 02:56:16,915
SAM: Not a lot.

3844
02:56:16,915 --> 02:56:22,134
LAURA: Is that for each person, or 1000 gold for
the whole party?

3845
02:56:22,134 --> 02:56:23,531
MATT: For the whole feast.

3846
02:56:23,531 --> 02:56:25,848
LAURA: How about you did three bowls?

3847
02:56:25,848 --> 02:56:27,158
MARISHA: Three bowls.

3848
02:56:27,158 --> 02:56:34,664
MATT: Mark 3000 gold from the group's queue. And
you have three gem bowls, using one now. So you

3849
02:56:34,664 --> 02:56:40,418
have two bowls left at your disposal. And you
prepare a Heroes' Feast for the group to consume.

3850
02:56:40,479 --> 02:56:44,502
MARISHA: I take some of that leftover wine, use
that to make it fancy wine.

3851
02:56:44,502 --> 02:56:46,216
SAM: This is great. This is awesome.

3852
02:56:46,216 --> 02:56:48,842
LAURA: Are we eating in the cellar?

3853
02:56:48,842 --> 02:56:53,236
MARISHA: So you get, I believe, 2d12 additional hit
points on top of your maximum hit points.

3854
02:56:53,299 --> 02:56:54,543
SAM: Wait, forever?

3855
02:56:54,543 --> 02:56:56,037
LAURA: No, no, for how long?

3856
02:56:56,037 --> 02:56:57,054
MARISHA: For 24 hours.

3857
02:56:57,054 --> 02:56:58,267
MATT: It lasts for 24 hours.

3858
02:56:58,267 --> 02:56:59,248
SAM: 2d12?

3859
02:56:59,248 --> 02:57:00,568
MATT: So, until about--

3860
02:57:00,568 --> 02:57:02,726
SAM: What the fuck is a d12? I've never rolled a
d12.

3861
02:57:02,726 --> 02:57:07,574
MATT: -- 2PM tomorrow. So mark that down, somebody
note that it lasts until 2PM.

3862
02:57:07,582 --> 02:57:09,973
LAURA: An additional 2d12?

3863
02:57:09,973 --> 02:57:11,518
MATT: 2d10?

3864
02:57:11,518 --> 02:57:12,733
MARISHA: Oh, I'm sorry, 2d10.

3865
02:57:12,733 --> 02:57:13,731
TALIESIN: Damn it.

3866
02:57:13,731 --> 02:57:16,917
LAURA: Overall hit points.

3867
02:57:16,917 --> 02:57:22,989
MARISHA: And, you should have- Ooh! I got two
tens!

3868
02:57:23,049 --> 02:57:24,988
LAURA: Ah, badass!

3869
02:57:24,988 --> 02:57:26,483
MATT: Trinket can also benefit from this, by the
way, too.

3870
02:57:26,483 --> 02:57:29,883
LAURA: Yay! Nice.

3871
02:57:29,940 --> 02:57:31,445
TALIESIN: You also get other bonuses.

3872
02:57:31,445 --> 02:57:35,077
MATT: Yep. You are immune to poison, and diseases,
and being frightened, and all wisdom saving throws

3873
02:57:35,077 --> 02:57:38,140
are made with advantage. Feast is awesome.

3874
02:57:38,140 --> 02:57:40,198
SAM: Why don't we do that right before we go see
the Briarwoods, also?

3875
02:57:40,198 --> 02:57:41,234
LAURA: We have another bowl.

3876
02:57:41,234 --> 02:57:43,072
MARISHA: We have two more bowls.

3877
02:57:43,072 --> 02:57:44,268
SAM: Because that is fucking awesome.

3878
02:57:44,268 --> 02:57:47,918
MARISHA: Doing that right now, just in case the
Briarwoods decide to come say hello.

3879
02:57:47,918 --> 02:57:51,940
TALIESIN: Or any of the other terrible people who
live in this town because there are terrible

3880
02:57:51,940 --> 02:57:53,594
people in this town.

3881
02:57:53,594 --> 02:57:55,317
TRAVIS: That was a delicious feast.

3882
02:57:55,317 --> 02:57:58,573
SAM: The tikka masala was tangy!

3883
02:57:58,573 --> 02:58:02,672
MARISHA: So, we're immune to poison--

3884
02:58:02,672 --> 02:58:16,085
MATT: And disease and frightened. So, feast
consumed, you now take your next eight hours--

3885
02:58:16,085 --> 02:58:18,820
MARISHA: I'm going to go meditate. I'll be back in
eight hours.

3886
02:58:18,820 --> 02:58:23,627
MATT: --to work on this. As she sits down to begin
the ritual of cleansing, or bringing plant

3887
02:58:23,627 --> 02:58:30,316
vitality enhancement to the vicinity of
Whitestone. We're going to go ahead and end

3888
02:58:30,316 --> 02:58:37,034
today's session there. Pick up at the end of that
spell at the beginning of next week.

3889
02:58:37,100 --> 02:58:43,442
TALIESIN: I love you all so much. I love you so much.

3890
02:58:43,442 --> 02:58:44,473
MATT: This is getting real interesting.

3891
02:58:44,473 --> 02:58:45,539
MARISHA: What time is it?

3892
02:58:45,539 --> 02:58:49,296
LIAM: It was like eight in the morning-ish when we 
found that building, yeah?

3893
02:58:49,296 --> 02:58:50,232
MATT: What?

3894
02:58:50,232 --> 02:58:52,801
LIAM: Was it around eight in the morning when we
got to that house?

3895
02:58:52,801 --> 02:58:54,616
MATT: You guys got to town around nine, 9:30.

3896
02:58:54,616 --> 02:58:57,763
LAURA: So the spell probably started around 11.

3897
02:58:57,763 --> 02:59:02,075
MATT: Walking around, seeing things, finding the 
tavern. And then getting in there and cleaning it out.

3898
02:59:02,075 --> 02:59:08,249
I'd say you're getting close to one, two o'clock now. 
You've also taken it slow, you're also being stealthy

3899
02:59:08,249 --> 02:59:09,947
and not trying to be conspicuous as you move 
through.

3900
02:59:09,947 --> 02:59:12,472
LAURA: Right, so we'll start the fight in the morning
the next day.

3901
02:59:12,472 --> 02:59:15,702
MARISHA: Well, I'm meditating now. I dropped into 
my meditation--

3902
02:59:15,702 --> 02:59:18,543
SAM: We're not starting any fight, we're forming
an insurgency.

3903
02:59:18,543 --> 02:59:22,020
MARISHA: Hopefully nothing happens and y'all don't
have to defend me while I'm doing this shit.

3904
02:59:22,020 --> 02:59:25,328
That's what I'm hoping for.

3905
02:59:25,936 --> 02:59:30,024
TALIESIN: I have stuff to give you, too, 'cause, yeah.

3906
02:59:30,954 --> 02:59:31,523
SAM: Wow.

3907
02:59:31,533 --> 02:59:32,700
LAURA: Man.

3908
02:59:32,700 --> 02:59:34,684
TALIESIN: Thank you for letting me roll with that,
by the way.

3909
02:59:34,765 --> 02:59:35,933
MATT: Of course. It fit right into my--

3910
02:59:35,933 --> 02:59:38,323
TALIESIN: I had a funny feeling it would.

3911
02:59:38,323 --> 02:59:41,985
MATT: All right, guys. So we'll pick up from there
next week, right in the center of the--

3912
02:59:41,985 --> 02:59:45,946
MARISHA: A tree full of dead us? That's fucked up.

3913
02:59:45,946 --> 02:59:46,763
LAURA: That's mean, Matt.

3914
02:59:46,763 --> 02:59:48,269
TALIESIN: That was some mean shit, man.

3915
02:59:48,269 --> 02:59:49,798
LIAM: That's what you call a giving tree.

3916
02:59:49,798 --> 02:59:53,426
MATT: It's a friendly place, Whitestone.

3917
02:59:53,426 --> 02:59:55,849
SAM: And the tree was happy. But not really.

3918
02:59:55,849 --> 03:00:00,812
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, so that was it.

3919
03:00:00,812 --> 03:00:06,112
MATT: All righty. Well, I guess we have the 
announcements.

3920
03:00:06,112 --> 03:00:07,820
ZAC: We have some donations.

3921
03:00:07,820 --> 03:00:09,982
MATT: Yeah, you guys are awesome.

3922
03:00:09,982 --> 03:00:14,776
ZAC: And I wanna thank the chatroom for being
on their best behavior tonight.

3923
03:00:14,776 --> 03:00:17,076
LAURA: Thanks, guys.

3924
03:00:17,076 --> 03:00:18,692
ZAC: Avoided the banhammer.

3925
03:00:18,692 --> 03:00:19,817
SAM: The what?

3926
03:00:19,817 --> 03:00:21,447
ZAC: They avoided the banhammer.

3927
03:00:21,447 --> 03:00:22,319
TALIESIN: There was no banhammer?

3928
03:00:22,319 --> 03:00:26,953
ZAC: Not by me, anyway. There's always a couple
trolls that find their way.

3929
03:00:26,953 --> 03:00:32,648
MATT: Yeah, it's the internet. Trolls happen. But 
yeah, guys, thank you for being respectful.

3930
03:00:32,648 --> 03:00:35,963
TALIESIN: Guys, thank you, oh my god, I'm so happy
to be sharing this.

3931
03:00:35,963 --> 03:00:39,556
ZAC: You know what makes you guys so awesome?
Donations for charity!

3932
03:00:39,556 --> 03:00:41,574
(all cheer)

3981
03:05:40,226 --> 03:05:46,091
ZAC: Another big charity cause tomorrow. Where
you're on drums. So tomorrow the Battle of the Bands

3982
03:05:46,091 --> 03:05:54,703
from 5-7PM. Your team, in case you don't know, is
you, Felicia Day, Tom Lenk, and Josephine, one of our mods.

3983
03:05:54,703 --> 03:05:59,714
See, Felicia was doing this thing where she was like,
what team could I put together that will immediately

3984
03:05:59,714 --> 03:06:07,042
win fan-favorite without doing any actual work?
So we saw your plan, Felicia, and we came back with

3985
03:06:07,042 --> 03:06:11,540
our team of Lucas, Mr. Spoopy in the back, running the

Amy Dallen, and we know, between Amy and Josephine,

3988
03:06:20,576 --> 03:06:24,489
our chat room is definitely going to be split on who's
the chat room favorite, so.

3989
03:06:24,556 --> 03:06:26,382

on Expert on guitar, I think you guys are gonna

have your work cut out for you. For sure.

TALESIN: Is that what you do?

3998
03:06:47,413 --> 03:06:50,620
MATT: I prefer to light my opponents on fire while
they're drumming, 'cause I find that's a

3999
03:06:50,807 --> 03:06:51,982
good challenge for their skillset.

4000
03:06:51,982 --> 03:06:57,742
ZAC: Oh, that would make sure a good show. I'm very
okay with it. Like, let's go for it.
