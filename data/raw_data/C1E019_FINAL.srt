1
00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:04,172
MATT: Welcome back to Critical Role this week,
ladies and gentlemen, where a bunch of us awesome

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:08,885
voice actors get together and play Dungeons and
Dragons weekly. We have the return of some of our

3
00:00:08,885 --> 00:00:13,698
fantastic guests from last week, but we'll get to
them in just a second. But first, let's go ahead

4
00:00:13,698 --> 00:00:17,138
and get you started with our fancy intro.

5
00:00:17,138 --> 00:01:26,384
[dramatic music]

6
00:01:26,384 --> 00:01:35,604
MATT: Welcome back! (giggles) Welcome back. We got
most everyone here right now. Travis is on his

7
00:01:35,604 --> 00:01:41,831
way. He flew all the way from Alaska, and thanks
to some delays-- weather and everything-- he's

8
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:45,646
getting here as fast as he can, so we may have a
Grog arriving a little late during today's

9
00:01:45,646 --> 00:01:51,043
session.  Pretty late for today's session. But in
the meantime, our illustrious Laura Bailey will be

10
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:52,722
controlling Grog.

11
00:01:52,722 --> 00:01:55,828
LAURA: (Grog voice) I would like to rage!

12
00:01:55,828 --> 00:02:02,223
MATT: Excited for that prospect. It should be a
lot of fun. So also want to thank you again, our

13
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:07,909
invited guests returning for their second week. We
have Felicia Day and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn. Thank

14
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:09,218
you, guys.

15
00:02:09,218 --> 00:02:10,552
MARY: Pleasure is mine.

16
00:02:10,552 --> 00:02:12,218
LAURA and MARY: Pleasure.

17
00:02:12,218 --> 00:02:14,164
FELICIA: Pleasure. I smell like peanut butter.

18
00:02:14,164 --> 00:02:15,264
MATT: That's delightful.

19
00:02:15,264 --> 00:02:17,124
FELICIA: That's why I smelled my fingers earlier.

20
00:02:17,124 --> 00:02:21,060
MARY: Is this a normal thing, or just today?

21
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,212
FELICIA: I just was like, hi! (sniffs)

22
00:02:23,212 --> 00:02:26,380
SAM: That's normally how people greet me.

23
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:34,770
FELICIA: If you smelled like grape jelly, we would
be BFFs! Anyway, hi.

24
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:43,269
MATT: So welcome back. Well, cool. Before we get
into it, a couple of quick announcements. One. For

25
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:47,335
every 100 subs that we get during the show
tonight, we'll be giving away our packages that

26
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:52,658
include a picture of the Critical Role cast,
signed, a Player's Handbook for Dungeons and

27
00:02:52,658 --> 00:02:56,903
Dragons, signed by the cast of Critical Role.
We'll also be giving away a copy of Felicia's

28
00:02:56,903 --> 00:02:59,169
awesome new book that she's about to go on a book
tour for.

29
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:01,226
(cheering)

30
00:03:01,226 --> 00:03:05,424
SAM: And it doesn't look like some self-published
thing, that looks like a real-- whoa!

31
00:03:05,424 --> 00:03:09,516
FELICIA: Not to insult self-published things, but
it's legit. There is a sparkle on my dress. That

32
00:03:09,516 --> 00:03:11,297
is a very high-class sparkle.

33
00:03:11,297 --> 00:03:13,157
SAM: Does it have a barcode on it?

34
00:03:13,157 --> 00:03:19,223
FELICIA: That is an android, that's why I look so
trim there. Yeah, but the book's coming out on

35
00:03:19,223 --> 00:03:23,890
Tuesday! So I'll be going on book tour, so if you
guys want to come see me, I'm going to 12 cities.

36
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:28,950
Sorry Midwest. I'm sorry. You're so angry at me.
Anyway, thank you, yeah.

37
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,100
MATT: Awesome, cool, well you guys get some copies
of that coming through. We also have a bunch of

38
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,431
other random goodies we'll be throwing in with
these packages that include other awesome DND

39
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:39,973
stuff and comics and it'll be a little surprise,
so for every 100 subscribers, we'll be giving one

40
00:03:39,973 --> 00:03:44,821
of those packages away, so that'll be fun. Also
wanted to do a quick announcement for one of our

41
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:48,046
friends recently put up a project here. Marisha,
if you want to do the intro.

42
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:54,240
MARISHA: Yes! Hi everybody. Okay, so. Boonzy
Arts-- they make geeky candles. They have a

43
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:02,129
Kickstarter right now called Wheel of Flame, and
they're making essentially DND thematic immersive

44
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:11,362
candles that smell like the environments that
you're in! This one is Dragon's Lair and it's

45
00:04:11,362 --> 00:04:12,883
smoky and musky.

46
00:04:12,883 --> 00:04:14,567
MATT: We're going to be lighting this tonight.

47
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:17,681
LAURA: Is there moldy dungeon smell?

48
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:22,143
MARISHA: They're coming out with a few more
because their Kickstarter's doing pretty well.

49
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,837
MATT: Basement tavern refuse candle.

50
00:04:24,837 --> 00:04:27,823
TALIESIN: Ogre's nest.

51
00:04:27,823 --> 00:04:29,789
MARISHA: I think they're making a tavern one.

52
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:32,058
SAM: Bed crap?

53
00:04:32,058 --> 00:04:34,849
(laughter)

54
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:36,775
MATT: That's a Critical Role exclusive. The
Scanlan offshoot.

55
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:41,705
MARISHA: Yeah, I think they have one that's Elven
Forest, that smells like a forest and they have

56
00:04:41,705 --> 00:04:48,218
one that's Sorcerer's Lair, that smells like sage
and stuff. But yeah, Wheel of Flame is their

57
00:04:48,218 --> 00:04:53,156
Kickstarter. Go check them out, I know they have a
limited amount of candles they can give out. Also,

58
00:04:53,156 --> 00:05:01,438
there's a d20 hidden in every candle, so when the
wax melts, you get a d20!

59
00:05:01,438 --> 00:05:03,366
LAURA: That's lovely.

60
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:05,132
MARISHA: So yeah! Check them out. Wheel of Flame.

61
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:08,707
MATT: Great. Thank you, Marisha.

62
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:11,762
(cheering)

63
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:19,832
MATT: So much flame. So yeah, for all you guys who
pay the extra subscription dollars for the

64
00:05:19,832 --> 00:05:24,669
smell-o-vision twitch stream, you will be
able to also experience the

65
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:27,095
sensory death of the party.

66
00:05:27,095 --> 00:05:29,396
LAURA: Why would you say that?

67
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:35,118
MATT: You guys picked it. But yeah, so that's
actually pretty cool. Hopefully there's not a

68
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:40,613
flammable d20 in there somewhere. That would be
problematic.

69
00:05:40,613 --> 00:05:43,342
FELICIA: That was weird.

70
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,047
SAM: That happens all the time.

71
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:47,372
FELICIA: Is it really just random kiss-bys?
Drive-by kiss?

72
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:49,886
MATT: Two weeks in a row. We already have a
winner?

73
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:51,328
ZAC: PrimeJohn1.

74
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:54,427
MATT: PrimeJohn1 is our first winner!
Congratulations, PrimeJohn1.

75
00:05:54,427 --> 00:05:56,285
SAM: PJ Uno!

76
00:05:56,285 --> 00:05:59,537
FELICIA: Did you have to rename him?

77
00:05:59,537 --> 00:06:01,932
SAM: Well, I gave him a nickname to the nickname.

78
00:06:01,932 --> 00:06:04,484
FELICIA: That's really adorable. It's a
sub-nickname.

79
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:06,263
SAM: A sub-nick!

80
00:06:06,263 --> 00:06:08,585
(laughter)

81
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:13,285
FELICIA: It'll eventually just be like (grunts).

82
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:20,989
MATT: Awesome, so let's go ahead and jump in here.
Anyone else have any other announcements they want

83
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:23,637
to say before we get into the game?

84
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:34,754
LAURA: Travis and I will be in Vancouver next
weekend. Not this coming weekend, but the weekend

85
00:06:34,754 --> 00:06:38,429
after. But we're not going to be here next week,
so yeah, should say that.

86
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:39,754
MATT: Awesome, so in Vancouver?

87
00:06:39,754 --> 00:06:43,827
LAURA: It's a con. And you should come say hi.

88
00:06:43,827 --> 00:06:44,977
MATT: In Vancouver.

89
00:06:44,977 --> 00:06:48,193
LAURA: In Vancouver. Go look at my Twitter. You'll
see what it is about.

90
00:06:48,193 --> 00:06:53,460
MATT: There you go. Vancouver convention. Laura
and Travis; it's going to be awesome. Also, me and

91
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:59,567
Marisha are flying out early morning tomorrow to a
convention called AkaiCon that's over in

92
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:03,082
Tennessee, so we'll be there this weekend. So if
any of you guys are over there on the eastern

93
00:07:03,082 --> 00:07:07,063
seaboard and that vicinity that want to come say
hi and hang out with us for the weekend, we have a

94
00:07:07,063 --> 00:07:09,673
bunch of fun panels and stuff, so. AkaiCon. Come
say hi.

95
00:07:09,673 --> 00:07:15,577
FELICIA: That smells delicious. I want to eat it.
Or is that you? No, it's not you.

96
00:07:15,577 --> 00:07:18,027
SAM: No, I rubbed peanut butter all over my
chest.

97
00:07:18,027 --> 00:07:19,869
(laughs)

98
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:23,515
MATT: Homeopathic VapoRub, really.

99
00:07:23,515 --> 00:07:28,241
SAM: Oh wow, I do smell it now. Yeah, that's
nice.

100
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:30,409
TALIESIN: Nothing fun right now.

101
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:33,793
FELICIA: Does it smell like ogre butt, because
isn't that what we're doing? Troll butt?

102
00:07:33,793 --> 00:07:40,697
MATT: Oh, and I also wanted to give a big thanks
out to Obsidian! They actually approved my use of

103
00:07:40,697 --> 00:07:47,341
the Pillars of Eternity soundtrack in our music
for the show. So now I'll be able to use elements

104
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:55,676
of their soundtrack for our game, so thank you
guys. And I guess, let's get into this game. So.

105
00:07:55,676 --> 00:08:04,481
Where we left off. Our party of adventurers, Vox
Machina, had broken a few rules in the city of

106
00:08:04,481 --> 00:08:12,868
Vasselheim and had actually infracted upon a
contract for a guild of creature hunters known as

107
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:18,104
the Slayer's Take. And this group essentially told
Vox Machina that either they could go and be

108
00:08:18,104 --> 00:08:25,203
arrested for this and put on trial for breaking
the law, or they could go and join the guild, as

109
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:28,466
such could be included and written onto the
contract and everything would be fine. So they

110
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:36,470
decided to go that route. They inquired with the
Huntmaster, and she basically told the party that

111
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:40,774
they could join after they went through a trial
where they had to complete a contract. However,

112
00:08:40,774 --> 00:08:45,078
she hand-chose and divided the party into two
separate, smaller groups. The first group being

113
00:08:45,078 --> 00:08:50,843
the one that began playing with us last week, in
which we had the illustrious Scanlan, Percy, Vex,

114
00:08:50,843 --> 00:08:58,175
and Grog paired up with two new adventurers, one
of which was Zahra the tiefling warlock, who also

115
00:08:58,175 --> 00:09:05,124
is a prospective interested person to join the
guild, the Slayer's Take, and Felicia's character,

116
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:11,482
Lyra, the human wizard, who somehow became a
member of the guild and is assigned on her

117
00:09:11,482 --> 00:09:16,951
first-ever excursion to lead this group towards
the end of their contract. Now, you the audience

118
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:23,656
chose the creature which they were going to hunt,
and you voted on an adult white dragon. So they've

119
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:25,216
been hunting that.

120
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:27,208
LAURA: I didn't realize the audience chose that.

121
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,514
FELICIA: Thanks, guys.

122
00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:31,056
(laughter)

123
00:09:31,056 --> 00:09:35,504
MATT: So after stalking your way up the Glasswalk
Road to the north of the city of Vasselheim,

124
00:09:35,504 --> 00:09:39,918
through the Vesper Timberlands, through the cold
weather as you continue to travel northward on the

125
00:09:39,918 --> 00:09:46,416
word of a crazed gentleman in a tavern somewhere
who supposedly saw a dragon, you managed to knock

126
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:54,651
over your flask. You managed to see such a dragon
skulking through the skies and actually attacking

127
00:09:54,651 --> 00:10:01,045
near where you were staying. While you were
sleeping, a group of orcs and some ogrish creature

128
00:10:01,045 --> 00:10:06,917
and a dire wolf, attacked your group, you managed
to slaughter the encroaching evils, rather rapidly

129
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:11,545
in a daring display of butt-flap long-john Percy.

130
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:15,160
(laughter)

131
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,510
MATT: Some majestic combat prowess you guys managed
to completely eliminate. You interrogated one of

132
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:25,501
the orcs before Grog decided to take his head off.
It pushed you north, north-west direction within

133
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:31,162
the forest itself. You managed to come upon what
looked to be a perpetual blizzard that was blowing

134
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:36,178
around this mountain range, and the dragon was
sighted again taking its rest to the north part of

135
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:40,351
this mountain. You pushed through the forest, managed
to avoid a few possible dangerous situations,

136
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:46,704
thanks to your ranger guiding you through her
favored terrain, eventually coming upon the base

137
00:10:46,704 --> 00:10:49,860
of this mountain range. Now, you looked above and
you saw what looked like the entrance to a cavern

138
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,551
where at least the dragon seems to fly in and out
of. It's a ways up the mountain, and there was a

139
00:10:54,551 --> 00:10:58,265
smaller cavern towards the base of the mountain.
You went to inquire what was in there, at which

140
00:10:58,265 --> 00:11:03,798
point out of nowhere, a giant rock made of solid
ice and stone was flung out of the forest,

141
00:11:03,798 --> 00:11:10,368
slamming into Vex, knocking her onto her ass and
doing a decent amount of physical damage.

142
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:11,640
LAURA: 30. 30 points.

143
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:17,578
MATT: 30 points physical damage to the ranger, at
which point two frost giants seemed to, one coming

144
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:20,910
out of that cavern, another seemed to be
stalking through the woods, approached the party

145
00:11:20,954 --> 00:11:27,791
and that is where we left off. So to begin this, I
would like everyone to roll initiative.

146
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:31,113
FELICIA: But they're friendly. They look
friendly.

147
00:11:31,113 --> 00:11:36,824
SAM:  Let's try reasoning with them. Whoa! That's
not bad

148
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:39,100
FELICIA: I'm not going to go last this time!
(gasps)

149
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,568
SAM: There's a lot of gasping going on.

150
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:45,358
FELICIA: It's not horrible but it's not (sharp
gasp).

151
00:11:45,358 --> 00:11:49,655
MATT: All right, so.

152
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:51,461
SAM: Wait, does Travis not--

153
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,932
MATT: Roll for Grog.

154
00:11:52,932 --> 00:11:54,236
LAURA: Roll for Grog.

155
00:11:54,236 --> 00:11:56,317
MATT: Roll for Grog's initiative.

156
00:11:56,317 --> 00:12:02,433
LAURA: I rolled 18 for me. Oh, that's good. 19 for
Grog.

157
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:04,988
MATT: All right, so we have 25 to 20, anyone?

158
00:12:04,988 --> 00:12:06,073
TALIESIN: 28.

159
00:12:06,073 --> 00:12:07,285
LAURA: What?!

160
00:12:07,285 --> 00:12:09,633
SAM: He rolled a natural 20.

161
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:11,333
TALIESIN: I rolled another natural 20.

162
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,044
LAURA: Those dice are magic.

163
00:12:13,044 --> 00:12:16,859
TALIESIN: I sacrificed a small child to these
dice.

164
00:12:16,859 --> 00:12:22,863
MATT: So Percy's up first. Anybody else above 20?

165
00:12:22,863 --> 00:12:25,857
FELICIA: I rolled a 20, but I have a negative two
initiative.

166
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:27,765
MATT: Okay. 19 or 18?

167
00:12:27,765 --> 00:12:30,413
LAURA: 19 for Grog. 18 for Vex.

168
00:12:30,413 --> 00:12:32,842
MATT: And also for Lyra.

169
00:12:32,842 --> 00:12:35,512
FELICIA: 18 buddies.

170
00:12:35,512 --> 00:12:41,966
MATT: (chuckling) That's sweet. So 15 to ten?

171
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:43,373
SAM: 15.

172
00:12:43,373 --> 00:12:45,668
LAURA: These are pretty good initiatives.

173
00:12:45,668 --> 00:12:47,145
MARY: 13.

174
00:12:47,145 --> 00:12:51,495
SAM: Hey, then we're all above 13, it's pretty
good! This bodes well.

175
00:12:51,495 --> 00:12:53,627
MARY: I have no initiative whatsoever.

176
00:12:53,627 --> 00:12:55,414
(laughter)

177
00:12:55,414 --> 00:12:59,377
MATT: All right, that'll do. So at the top of the
round as one giant has pulled itself out of the

178
00:12:59,377 --> 00:13:03,809
cavern and begins shouting over in Giant about the
intruders. The secondary one that comes stalking

179
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:07,374
out of the forest, both of them with these giant
axes that are currently held on the side of

180
00:13:07,374 --> 00:13:12,368
leather belts (roars) give a bellowing scream and
go charging into the fray. At the top of the

181
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:14,521
round, though, Percy is ready. What have you got?

182
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:18,768
TALIESIN: What is that strange orange thing, right
here?

183
00:13:18,768 --> 00:13:20,418
MATT: This is actually a tree.

184
00:13:20,418 --> 00:13:22,275
TALIESIN: That's a tree. Okay, good. So that's
cover?

185
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:26,829
MATT: Yeah. This rock and these boulders here have
some cover, but from a giant who has a very large

186
00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:28,504
perspective maybe not as much as you'd think.

187
00:13:28,504 --> 00:13:32,584
TALIESIN: Okay, so is there any way I can maybe
get some partial cover right over here?

188
00:13:32,584 --> 00:13:35,587
MATT: You could move over this way, yes.

189
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:41,095
TALIESIN: Yeah. So I've got cover from the tree
from this one until he moves,

190
00:13:41,265 --> 00:13:42,769
but I can see this guy?

191
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:43,778
MATT: Correct.

192
00:13:43,778 --> 00:13:46,240
TALIESIN: It is Bad News time! I'm going to bust
out Bad News and take a shot.

193
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,890
MATT: All right, so. Rip out Bad News, uses one of
your attacks, second attack prepares it. You're

194
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,482
ready to fire, go ahead and shoot.

195
00:13:54,482 --> 00:13:59,405
TALIESIN: All right. They're pretty big, so I'm
going to take the negative five to my attack bonus

196
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:06,914
and see what that does. That's a 21.

197
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,629
MATT: 21 will hit.

198
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:22,114
TALIESIN: That's a good shot. Oh yeah! That's 17,
27, plus-- 33 points of damage.

199
00:14:22,114 --> 00:14:31,228
MATT: 33 points of damage? Nice. So you hear this
loud, ringing explosion that echoes through this

200
00:14:31,228 --> 00:14:35,206
small valley at the base of the mountain, and from
out the corner of your eye, it's the first time

201
00:14:35,206 --> 00:14:40,993
you've seen this weapon do its wonders. You see a
flash of light, a plume of smoke goes up and you see

202
00:14:40,993 --> 00:14:48,476
this impossibly fast blast of some projectile go
slamming into the shoulder of the giant over here

203
00:14:48,476 --> 00:14:52,150
that's currently reaching for a rock. It pushes
him back against the wall, which prevents him from

204
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:55,900
falling over and he catches himself. Looks back,
and you can see there's a small crater in the

205
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,060
armor where a little bit of blood begins to pour
out, and a little bit of smoke seems to be pouring

206
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:05,727
out of the impact. (snarls and yells) Gives out a
really angry yell. You can see like spittle that

207
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:10,852
begins to shake loose and spray from his mouth out
of frustration. That the end of your turn?

208
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:15,515
TALIESIN: That is the end of my turn. Yeah. I am
now going, maybe I shouldn't have done that.

209
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,603
(laughter)

210
00:15:17,603 --> 00:15:19,449
FELICIA: It was very impressive. It was very
impressive.

211
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:20,870
MATT: All right, Grog's up first.

212
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,290
LAURA: (Grog voice) Grog--

213
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,288
SAM: (Grog voice) Would like--

214
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:37,222
LAURA: (Grog voice) No, Grog doesn't want to Rage!
Grog shouts out in Giant, wait! My giant masters

215
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:44,514
were killed by a white dragon, which we think is
here. Will you help us fight him?

216
00:15:44,514 --> 00:15:50,788
MATT: Okay. So as Grog stands there, shouting this
out to both sides to the two giants, I want to

217
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:54,256
have Grog go ahead and roll a persuasion check.

218
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:57,196
LAURA: Okay. I am going to use Grog's dice.

219
00:15:57,196 --> 00:15:59,488
MATT: Yes. Let's do this proper. This is
customary.

220
00:15:59,488 --> 00:16:03,931
LAURA: It is proper. Wait. Okay. That's not his,
that is mine.

221
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:06,187
TALIESIN: (Grog voice) I would like to negotiate.

222
00:16:06,187 --> 00:16:10,186
LAURA: Okay. Well that is good. He is really happy
that I am playing him,

223
00:16:10,352 --> 00:16:13,620
because I rolled a one for Grog.

224
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,783
SAM: It might work.

225
00:16:15,783 --> 00:16:18,874
(laughter)

226
00:16:18,874 --> 00:16:25,267
LAURA: I think I should not-- okay. Wait!

227
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:27,470
MARY: Doesn't Grog get two actions or no?

228
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,587
LAURA: That's his action.

229
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:32,224
MATT: He is not putting up any aggressive action.

230
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:40,567
LAURA: Does he get advantage, however, because he
is speaking Giant and he's in the cold?

231
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:42,745
MATT: No.

232
00:16:42,745 --> 00:16:44,278
(laughter)

233
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:49,004
MATT: Because you have an entire band of seemingly
advancing and armed individuals that are currently

234
00:16:49,004 --> 00:16:53,638
stalking towards what appears to be the home of
these individuals. So unfortunately no. They seem

235
00:16:53,826 --> 00:16:58,869
unfazed, and the one at the back seems almost
partially amused at this plea and you can see as

236
00:16:58,869 --> 00:17:05,379
he takes his axe and puts it up against his
shoulder and runs it across the leather in a very

237
00:17:05,379 --> 00:17:08,483
aggressive, intimidating fashion as he stalks
forward out of the forest.

238
00:17:08,483 --> 00:17:11,621
LAURA: (Grog voice) Can Grog move at all?

239
00:17:11,621 --> 00:17:13,660
MATT: Yeah, would you like Grog to move? It would
be easier.

240
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,312
LAURA: (Grog voice) Where is he?

241
00:17:14,312 --> 00:17:17,192
MATT: He is right here. He is hard to miss. Where
would you like Grog to move?

242
00:17:17,192 --> 00:17:18,854
There is a giant rock there.

243
00:17:18,854 --> 00:17:21,019
LAURA: He is going to stay there.

244
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:26,366
MATT: Okay. Grog is going to stay up against the
rock. His axe across the front. Right, that ends

245
00:17:26,366 --> 00:17:28,217
Grog's turn. Vex, you're up.

246
00:17:28,217 --> 00:17:31,512
(laughter)

247
00:17:31,512 --> 00:17:36,063
LAURA: A moment of silence for that horrible thing
I just witnessed.

248
00:17:36,063 --> 00:17:42,605
MATT: You are over here. You just got up off the
ground after being slammed with a boulder, and you

249
00:17:42,605 --> 00:17:43,784
have Trinket there.

250
00:17:43,784 --> 00:17:48,188
LAURA: I am very hurt. Can I get up? Am I prone?

251
00:17:48,188 --> 00:17:52,652
MATT: In the process you've gotten to your feet as
they lurched forward and began shouting at each

252
00:17:52,652 --> 00:17:54,774
other about the intruders. So you are on your
feet.

253
00:17:54,774 --> 00:18:01,194
LAURA: Okay. I am going to cast Hunter's Mark.

254
00:18:01,194 --> 00:18:03,256
MATT: Hunter's Mark. On?

255
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:15,878
LAURA: On the one that took a little damage
already. And then I am going to shoot him. All

256
00:18:15,878 --> 00:18:21,601
these are for like really large groups of people.
I am going to shoot him three times. Can I shoot

257
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,769
him three times?

258
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:23,828
MATT: You have two attacks.

259
00:18:23,828 --> 00:18:34,005
LAURA: I'm going to shoot him two times. This was
good times. This was fun, you guys. 14 for that.

260
00:18:34,005 --> 00:18:41,690
That probably doesn't hit. 14 also doesn't hit the
second time. Oh my god! What is happening?!

261
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,847
(laughter)

262
00:18:43,847 --> 00:18:45,148
SAM: She just disappeared!

263
00:18:45,148 --> 00:18:47,441
MARY: Vex! Vex, stay with us! Vex!

264
00:18:47,441 --> 00:18:51,924
MATT: So as you get to your feet, you look over
your shoulder, you point your finger out and as

265
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:57,431
you squint down, you use your ranger focus to make
sure this guy is your quarry, and you take a quick

266
00:18:57,431 --> 00:19:01,706
scope of his body parts. You're like, those are
the areas that will make him weakest. As you go to

267
00:19:01,706 --> 00:19:04,968
pull your arrow, you can feel a kink in your
shoulder. The impact of the rock seems to have

268
00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:09,957
affected you. You release the first arrow and it's
just slightly off mark. The second one you pull

269
00:19:09,957 --> 00:19:14,101
back and as you release it, it actually splinters
off his shield as he knocks it out of the air.

270
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:20,692
LAURA: I am going to run over to cover. What is
that other side?

271
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:25,064
MATT: That is one of the mountain
outcroppings.

272
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:28,583
LAURA: Yeah, I am going to hide in that little
thing and go, Trinket hide with me.

273
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:34,554
MATT: Okay, Trinket moves up. (bear moan) All
right, and that's your turn.

274
00:19:34,554 --> 00:19:35,890
LAURA: That's all of it.

275
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,968
MATT: (laughs) All right, Lyra, you're up.

276
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:42,636
FELICIA: Okay, I am freaked out right now. These
are very large individuals. I have only read about

277
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:49,958
them, and they smell slightly like feet. So I am
going to-- that is a stench. That is like an

278
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:56,061
athlete's foot commercial waiting to happen. So I
am going to take 10d6 and do Disintegrate.

279
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,202
MATT: Go for it.

280
00:19:58,202 --> 00:20:08,773
FELICIA: I mean, it seems excessive, but they're
very large men! One, two, three, four, five-- That

281
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:13,425
one, he looks like a bull. In the nether-regions.

282
00:20:13,425 --> 00:20:15,331
MATT: So which one, this one or this one?

283
00:20:15,331 --> 00:20:17,324
FELICIA: I don't think I can reach that guy.

284
00:20:17,324 --> 00:20:18,698
MATT: What's the distance on it?

285
00:20:18,698 --> 00:20:19,874
FELICIA: Oh boy.

286
00:20:19,874 --> 00:20:22,178
MATT: At your spell sheet.

287
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:30,940
FELICIA: I should've written that down.
Disintegrate. Oh, there it is! 60 feet.

288
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,358
MATT: 60 feet? Yeah, they're both within range.

289
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:38,935
FELICIA: Oh gosh, well I should probably hit the
wounded one. That always makes RPG sense, right?

290
00:20:38,935 --> 00:20:43,532
MATT: So for that one, do you have to make an
actual spell attack roll?

291
00:20:43,532 --> 00:20:46,590
FELICIA: No, I don't. I think it's force damage.

292
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,996
MATT: That's right. You just point at it and he
has to roll a saving throw.

293
00:20:50,996 --> 00:20:56,309
FELICIA: Oh yay! Look at that! Six! Six! Six!

294
00:20:56,309 --> 00:20:57,696
SAM: Well, don't say that.

295
00:20:57,696 --> 00:20:59,464
(laughter)

296
00:20:59,464 --> 00:21:03,522
MATT: All this time trying to fight the stigma of
DND, and there we go.

297
00:21:03,522 --> 00:21:05,565
MARY: Talking to my people here!

298
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:21,064
FELICIA: All right. That's 20 plus-- now you're
all staring at me! 30, 40 points of damage!

299
00:21:21,064 --> 00:21:22,496
SAM: Whoa!

300
00:21:22,496 --> 00:21:26,856
MATT: That's a total of 40? Plus 40?

301
00:21:26,856 --> 00:21:28,282
FELICIA: 40 plus 40.

302
00:21:28,282 --> 00:21:31,837
MATT: Yeah, Disintegrate. And he failed his saving
throw.

303
00:21:31,837 --> 00:21:34,151
TALIESIN: Yeah!

304
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:38,294
FELICIA: In your anus! That's what she yells,
she's like, in your anus!

305
00:21:38,294 --> 00:21:42,623
MATT: So as she shouts, she points her finger out,
there's a little poof of arcane energy on her

306
00:21:42,623 --> 00:21:48,603
finger, and a tiny, sickly green ray of energy
just streaks forth from her finger. The giant

307
00:21:48,603 --> 00:21:53,291
looks at it awkwardly, and in the split second it
hits him in the front of his chest and suddenly

308
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,669
the armor in front of him turns to dust and you
can see his flesh beginning to just disappear in

309
00:21:56,669 --> 00:22:01,327
front of him (gasps) and suddenly tries to gasp
for air, as you see part of its jaw beginning to

310
00:22:01,327 --> 00:22:07,999
just turn to sand, and it's actually struggling in
a series of pain, and it's still standing, but you

311
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:14,167
can see a large part of its body now is just
missing. It looks like it got-- it's almost like a

312
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:20,492
portion of it rotted right before you, but there's
no actual necrosis. It's just gone. Flesh is

313
00:22:20,492 --> 00:22:27,143
missing from a large part of its body. It looks
like it's doing really poorly. It lurches forward,

314
00:22:27,143 --> 00:22:33,055
and one of its arms is not working as well and it
looks at you with a look of confusion, frustration

315
00:22:33,055 --> 00:22:36,593
and "how could you?." It's incredulous in its
torturous pain.

316
00:22:36,593 --> 00:22:43,111
FELICIA: And I go, (gibberish) in Giant and it's
the only thing I know in Giant, and I think it

317
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:48,321
says, you are my foe, and I actually say, my cat
is your friend.

318
00:22:48,321 --> 00:22:56,203
MATT: Its head turns even further to the side as
the tongue lolls out of where the cheek once was.

319
00:22:56,203 --> 00:22:57,927
FELICIA: Take that!

320
00:22:57,927 --> 00:23:02,808
MATT: (chuckles) Its angry white eyes glaring
aggressively at you. Do you wish to move, or would

321
00:23:02,808 --> 00:23:04,188
you like to stay where you are?

322
00:23:04,188 --> 00:23:06,834
FELICIA: Oh, I think I'm going to duck behind that
little outcropping I have.

323
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:07,796
MATT: Over here?

324
00:23:07,796 --> 00:23:13,214
FELICIA: Yeah, no, behind that little rock-- oh,
where am I? Oh, I'm over there. Yeah, I'm going to

325
00:23:13,214 --> 00:23:20,107
get-- oh boy. Just stand there, I'm just too
flushed right now. I can't go anywhere. This is

326
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,441
too situational for me

327
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:31,196
MATT: All right. Well, (chuckles) this very
unhappy giant is going to reach over with his one

328
00:23:31,196 --> 00:23:35,810
good arm, the other one's clutching the axe, it
reaches over and grabs another rock off the ground

329
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,842
that it can find nearby and (whoosh) flings it at
you.

330
00:23:38,842 --> 00:23:40,598
FELICIA: I should have moved!

331
00:23:40,598 --> 00:23:42,555
(laughter)

332
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:45,413
MATT: That is a 16. What's your armor class?

333
00:23:45,413 --> 00:23:46,935
FELICIA: 13.

334
00:23:46,935 --> 00:23:51,079
MATT: Yeah. You, unable to really move out of the
way, you look over and just watch it come toward

335
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:55,817
you as it slowly spins in the air. Time seems to
slow as you make no intent to shift out of the

336
00:23:55,817 --> 00:24:01,601
way. (whack) It slams into you, physical pain not
hitting in as the immediate look of-- the sight of

337
00:24:01,601 --> 00:24:05,672
white, your vision is knocked to nothingness
briefly. You end up taking--

338
00:24:05,672 --> 00:24:09,087
MARY: No, Lyra, no.

339
00:24:09,087 --> 00:24:14,543
MATT: Okay, you take 32 points of bludgeoning
damage.

340
00:24:14,543 --> 00:24:20,488
FELICIA: Whoa! That is a very intense amount of
damage for a tiny woman. Okay.

341
00:24:20,488 --> 00:24:24,525
LAURA: You should avoid those boulders in the
future.

342
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:30,889
MATT: And as soon as you recover from it, your
vision clarifies and you're able to see everything

343
00:24:30,889 --> 00:24:36,291
before you, and you see that same giant is
stalking up, right into your face, with its axe in

344
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:39,792
its bad hand. It switches it into its good hand
and rears it up preparing itself for another

345
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:50,947
round. That ends that giant's turn. It's going to
go five, six and move in between the two of you.

346
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:56,648
You guys, Zahra and Scanlan, as you see this
happening you hear the (heavy steps) heavy

347
00:24:56,648 --> 00:24:59,357
footfalls behind you, and you look over your
shoulder as the second giant comes up with the

348
00:24:59,357 --> 00:25:05,079
shield in one arm. Axe is going to go ahead and
giant swing towards the two of you. That is going

349
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:07,494
to be a 19 to hit on you, Scanlan.

350
00:25:07,494 --> 00:25:08,934
SAM: Oh yeah.

351
00:25:08,934 --> 00:25:14,157
MATT: And Zahra, that is going to be a-- that's a
25. All right.

352
00:25:14,157 --> 00:25:17,626
(laughter)

353
00:25:17,626 --> 00:25:32,581
MATT: 27 points of slashing damage to you,
Scanlan. Ooh. All right. And that is 31 points of

354
00:25:32,581 --> 00:25:37,047
slashing damage to you, Zahra. As it just (whack),
cleaves through the both of you. You are almost

355
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:40,145
knocked off your feet from the sheer blow. Most of
the armor takes the damage but you can feel a

356
00:25:40,145 --> 00:25:44,396
heavy bruise, and underneath your armor you can feel a
little bit of the blood beginning to soak through

357
00:25:44,396 --> 00:25:49,891
from the severe impact. Part of the armor plating
might have cut into part of your torso (grunts)

358
00:25:49,891 --> 00:25:54,009
but you right yourself there. That ends their
turn. That brings us to Scanlan.

359
00:25:54,009 --> 00:26:02,454
SAM: Okay. Hey, question. If I hold a turn, do I
hold the whole turn? Can I hold my action but do

360
00:26:02,454 --> 00:26:04,314
the bonus action? How does it work?

361
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:07,025
MATT: You got to take all your turn at once. You
can hold your initiative. Meaning

362
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:10,749
you can wait to activate your
turn later in the tier, but you can't piecemeal

363
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:11,837
your actions.

364
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:17,579
SAM: Okay, then I am going to just move. I am
going to act. I am going to do things. So I turn

365
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:24,675
to the guy who just hit me, and I am going to cast
Dominate Person on him. I will sing some sort of

366
00:26:24,675 --> 00:26:26,597
song to dominate him with.

367
00:26:26,597 --> 00:26:31,004
MATT: I will say, Dominate Person is effective
against humanoids.

368
00:26:31,004 --> 00:26:32,550
SAM: (gasps) Really?!

369
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,608
MATT: Dominate Monster would be--

370
00:26:34,608 --> 00:26:36,034
SAM: They're not humanoid?

371
00:26:36,034 --> 00:26:39,885
MATT: They are not. They are considered giants.
They are a different species.

372
00:26:39,885 --> 00:26:40,987
You would know that.

373
00:26:40,987 --> 00:26:43,335
SAM: I would know that. Well, then, I guess I
won't do that.

374
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,916
MATT: You turn, and your instinct is there, and
you're like, these are a little out of your reach

375
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:48,495
as far as that spell is concerned.

376
00:26:48,495 --> 00:26:49,675
SAM: Okay.

377
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:54,317
(laughter)

378
00:26:54,317 --> 00:26:56,184
MARY: It is a very short show tonight.

379
00:26:56,184 --> 00:26:58,456
SAM: Yeah. Okay, well, then we just die.

380
00:26:58,456 --> 00:27:00,282
(laughter)

381
00:27:00,282 --> 00:27:01,860
MATT: You've got options!

382
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:13,470
SAM: Yeah, no, I have options. I'll be fine.
Should I go for the guy who-- I'll do (blows

383
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:18,066
raspberry). I'll cast Lightning Bolt on him. That's
always a good go-to.

384
00:27:18,066 --> 00:27:22,723
MATT: So as you fumble with the idea of what spell
would work, you release a bolt of lightning up

385
00:27:22,723 --> 00:27:28,066
towards it. It streaks into the front of its chest
and shoulder area. You can see its muscles tense

386
00:27:28,066 --> 00:27:32,890
and shake from the sheer amount of electricity
that courses into it. It does not make that saving

387
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,887
throw, not with a five. So go ahead and roll your
damage.

388
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:36,945
SAM: Is it six or eight?

389
00:27:36,945 --> 00:27:38,156
MATT: It's 8d6.

390
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:49,076
SAM: Thank you! Okay. Six, six, four. What is
that?

391
00:27:49,076 --> 00:27:50,100
FELICIA: Six.

392
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:55,824
SAM: Oh, really? Oh, that's awesome! Now I lost
track. 32.

393
00:27:55,824 --> 00:28:02,715
MATT: 32 points of damage. Nice! So as you release
the torrent of electrical energy, it courses

394
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:06,736
through the body and ends up streaking off into
the snowy, blizzardy sky behind the giant from the

395
00:28:06,736 --> 00:28:12,253
upward angle. It (grunts) shakes from the impact,
and then rights itself and looks down at you with

396
00:28:12,253 --> 00:28:18,462
a really angry face. You can see as it opens its
mouth, this light blue and dark teeth on the

397
00:28:18,462 --> 00:28:24,983
bottom of its beard-covered jaw. Mist and steam
tend to pour out of its mouth. But not like heated

398
00:28:24,983 --> 00:28:29,592
steam, this is like a cold air itself that it
seems to emanate from it. Its pale whitish-blue

399
00:28:29,592 --> 00:28:33,559
hair, slightly framing its form. Up close, at its
sheer size, this is a very intimidating creature,

400
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:38,813
as it just stares down looming over you, now with
smoke pouring off its shoulder where you impacted

401
00:28:38,813 --> 00:28:41,637
it with the Lightning Bolt. Do you want to do
any--

402
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:47,785
SAM: I would like to inspire our new fellow,
Zahra, with a quick little ditty. (singing) Ooh,

403
00:28:47,785 --> 00:28:54,672
you so scary, ooh, you so scary, ooh, you so
scary. You fighty long time.

404
00:28:54,672 --> 00:28:57,316
(laughter)

405
00:28:57,316 --> 00:29:02,486
MATT: All right. So you go ahead and take a d10
inspiration dice. Which means, whenever you have

406
00:29:02,486 --> 00:29:08,018
to roll an attack roll or saving throw, you can
add a d10 to the result you get if you don't think

407
00:29:08,018 --> 00:29:09,151
it's going to make it.

408
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:11,716
You don't roll it now, but you just have it
on reserve whenever you want to use it.

409
00:29:12,009 --> 00:29:13,135
MARY: Love it.

410
00:29:13,135 --> 00:29:15,593
SAM: And if I move away from him he'll hit me?

411
00:29:15,593 --> 00:29:17,177
MATT: He'll get an attack of opportunity, yes.

412
00:29:17,177 --> 00:29:20,105
SAM: Can I snuggle between his legs and maybe
he'll forget I'm there?

413
00:29:20,105 --> 00:29:22,060
FELICIA: He's hung like a horse.

414
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,810
TALIESIN: You're going to hit yourself in the
head

415
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:27,143
MARY: Swing on it, man. Swing on it.

416
00:29:27,143 --> 00:29:29,469
(laughter)

417
00:29:29,469 --> 00:29:31,364
MARY: Yes! Yes, Scanlan!

418
00:29:31,364 --> 00:29:35,667
MATT: Do you want to try and do that?

419
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:40,900
SAM: It might anger him? Or it might entice him.

420
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,026
(laughter)

421
00:29:43,026 --> 00:29:44,206
SAM: I'll just stay put.

422
00:29:44,206 --> 00:29:46,776
MATT: All right. Zahra, you're up.

423
00:29:46,814 --> 00:29:53,576
MARY: All right, I have a question. Do they
understand English?

424
00:29:53,576 --> 00:29:55,611
MATT: You are not aware, actually.

425
00:29:55,611 --> 00:29:58,478
LAURA: But he said intruder when we came in.

426
00:29:58,478 --> 00:30:03,651
MATT: You heard him say it in Giant. It
was understood by Grog that it was intruder.

427
00:30:03,651 --> 00:30:06,628
MARY: All right. They're both within about 30 feet
of me, yes?

428
00:30:06,628 --> 00:30:10,282
MATT: Yes. They're both within 30 feet of you

429
00:30:10,282 --> 00:30:22,598
MARY: All right! I'm going to use one of my skills
that I have which it doesn't expel a spell slot

430
00:30:22,598 --> 00:30:29,407
and use Awakened Mind and touch them both with
telekinesis, and in doing so I shall cast Mass

431
00:30:29,407 --> 00:30:36,900
Suggestion, and I shall say to them, you will take
us to your enemy, the white dragon, and there we

432
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:43,834
shall slay it together. Then you shall return us
here safely, where we shall part as friends bonded

433
00:30:43,834 --> 00:30:47,382
forever in the slaying of a common enemy.

434
00:30:47,382 --> 00:30:58,231
MATT: All right. As you're looking out at the two
of them, you release this energy, speaking through

435
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:02,355
your mind, reaching out to theirs. What is the DC of
your spell? It should be at the top of your spell

436
00:31:02,355 --> 00:31:04,021
list, the difficulty class.

437
00:31:04,021 --> 00:31:06,611
SAM: Spell save DC. Top right.

438
00:31:06,611 --> 00:31:10,379
LAURA: Spell save DC is a 17.

439
00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:19,472
MATT: 17, all right. So both of them seem to--

440
00:31:19,472 --> 00:31:22,707
LAURA: Can you add your inspiration? Add your
inspiration!

441
00:31:22,707 --> 00:31:26,670
MATT: Inspiration has to be added to a roll.

442
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,992
MARY: My charisma is added to any spell that I
cast.

443
00:31:28,992 --> 00:31:37,297
MATT: Well, that's included with the DC there. So
both of them reach up and grab their faces, one

444
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:41,941
with its messed up, partially disintegrated hand
and falls back on its back foot and both of them

445
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:49,836
look at the group in confusion. There definitely
seems to be some sort of interference with their

446
00:31:49,836 --> 00:31:54,324
current actions based on this spell; there is a
conflict within them. That's as much as I can tell

447
00:31:54,324 --> 00:32:04,156
you right now at the moment. That's your action.
Do you want to do anything else? You can still

448
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:06,114
move. You still have a bonus action, if you want

449
00:32:06,114 --> 00:32:08,003
MARY: What do you mean bonus action?

450
00:32:08,003 --> 00:32:12,754
MATT: Your Hex is a bonus action, but that is a
spell, as well.

451
00:32:12,754 --> 00:32:18,179
MARY: If I move away from them though...

452
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:19,591
LAURA: He can hit you.

453
00:32:19,591 --> 00:32:23,552
TALIESIN: If he's going to hit you. He might not.

454
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:27,261
LAURA: That's true! Your spell might have worked.

455
00:32:27,261 --> 00:32:32,852
MARY: I shall go and protect Scanlan, underneath
the legs of that giant.

456
00:32:32,852 --> 00:32:35,487
MATT: So you move in to help defend Scanlan.

457
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:42,110
MARY: He's so tiny, I love little guys. I always
have.

458
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,829
SAM: She's a mother figure.

459
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:53,742
MATT: All right, so both of them seem to be
looking around themselves, slightly confused and

460
00:32:53,742 --> 00:32:58,649
taking in some sort of strange circumstance.
Percy, you're up.

461
00:32:58,649 --> 00:33:02,224
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold my turn.

462
00:33:02,224 --> 00:33:07,468
MATT: Okay, Percy's holding initiative. Grog.

463
00:33:07,468 --> 00:33:20,685
LAURA: Should I say, in Giant, (in Grog voice)
What say you? Let's fight this bastard. Together.

464
00:33:20,685 --> 00:33:30,520
MATT: All right, they look at Grog, confused. Look
at each other again. That's Grog's turn, Vex?

465
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:37,947
LAURA: Seriously? While everybody's having a
conversation, I would like to take

466
00:33:37,947 --> 00:33:39,335
a healing potion.

467
00:33:39,335 --> 00:33:41,566
MATT: All right. Go ahead and take one of those

468
00:33:41,566 --> 00:33:47,536
LAURA: Okay. How much do I take for a superior?

469
00:33:47,536 --> 00:33:55,821
MATT: Superior? Superior is 8d4 plus eight. It's
quite a bit.

470
00:33:55,821 --> 00:34:01,263
LAURA: It is, so just regular healing potion for
now. Which is what, 2d8?

471
00:34:01,263 --> 00:34:03,941
MATT: A regular is 2d4 plus two.

472
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:12,111
LAURA: Yay! That's good.

473
00:34:12,111 --> 00:34:13,785
MATT: Lyra.

474
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:24,934
FELICIA: I'm confused. But I do not feel good; I
might throw up. So I'm going to hold my turn to

475
00:34:24,934 --> 00:34:26,174
see what happens.

476
00:34:26,174 --> 00:34:27,788
MATT: Go ahead and make a constitution saving
throw.

477
00:34:27,788 --> 00:34:29,221
FELICIA: Oh, good.

478
00:34:29,221 --> 00:34:30,697
SAM: Oh, for the barf.

479
00:34:30,697 --> 00:34:36,536
FELICIA: Oh, it's a five! Constitution five. It's
a ten.

480
00:34:36,536 --> 00:34:42,523
MATT: You covertly do your best to not reveal to
the entire group that you make a little

481
00:34:42,523 --> 00:34:44,352
greenish-brown snow.

482
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:47,005
(laughter)

483
00:34:47,005 --> 00:34:55,349
MATT: It is the most adorable barfing sound you
guys have ever heard, though. The combination of

484
00:34:55,349 --> 00:35:01,994
the stress and the smell, it's been a harrowing
experience for Lyra in these past few minutes. At

485
00:35:01,994 --> 00:35:08,081
this point in time, as it comes to the giants'
turn. The one who is messed up looks over to the

486
00:35:08,081 --> 00:35:16,998
other and (sighs) puts the axe into his belt loop,
and the other also one puts its axe in the belt

487
00:35:16,998 --> 00:35:28,974
loop, and they glare at the rest of the group, and
say in Giant, (gibberish). And any of you speak

488
00:35:28,974 --> 00:35:30,131
Giant? Or just Grog.

489
00:35:30,131 --> 00:35:31,242
LAURA: Grog.

490
00:35:31,242 --> 00:35:35,989
MATT: Grog translates. Essentially, they say, "We
will take you but it is at your own folly."

491
00:35:35,989 --> 00:35:40,225
LAURA: (in Grog voice) They'll take us, but it is
at our own folly.

492
00:35:40,225 --> 00:35:47,574
SAM: Take us as in-- Grog, can you ask them, take
us as in lead us or on their back?

493
00:35:47,574 --> 00:35:58,902
LAURA: (strangled gibberish) Which translates to,
take us as in lead us or carry us on your back?

494
00:35:58,902 --> 00:36:07,565
MATT: They both chuckle to themselves, and they
start walking in towards the cavern.

495
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:13,637
LAURA: Wait! Can we rest a little before we go
fight this thing so we can get spell slots back

496
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:14,916
and heal?

497
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:16,464
MATT: That's up to you guys.

498
00:36:16,464 --> 00:36:18,010
LAURA: Can we? Yes! Yes!

499
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,114
FELICIA: Up to 24 hours. This one lasts the whole
day. Yeah, can we?

500
00:36:20,114 --> 00:36:22,013
MATT: It lasts for 24 hours.

501
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,886
MARY: Mass Suggestion lasts for 24 hours.

502
00:36:23,886 --> 00:36:25,377
SAM: Oh, that is good information.

503
00:36:25,377 --> 00:36:34,500
MARY: Oh and very important: none of us can damage
these two giants. Anything else can, we're fine,

504
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,378
but should any of us damage it, the spell is
poof.

505
00:36:38,378 --> 00:36:46,495
LAURA: Are they going to fight with us? Grog? Will
you ask them if they're going to fight with us?

506
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,489
(gibberish)

507
00:36:48,489 --> 00:36:49,608
MATT: How does it go, again?

508
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:51,072
LAURA: (repeats previous gibberish)

509
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:55,749
MATT: Right. One of them looks over the shoulder as
it's walking into the cavern and puts its hand on

510
00:36:55,749 --> 00:37:00,491
the top and leans over and its voice, and I will
say from this point forth it is translated to make

511
00:37:00,491 --> 00:37:01,457
it easier.

512
00:37:01,457 --> 00:37:02,865
SAM: Just like in Hunt for Red October?

513
00:37:02,865 --> 00:37:12,353
MATT: Yeah basically. "We take you but that is as
much as you get. The rest is your own choice.

514
00:37:12,353 --> 00:37:18,037
"Perhaps the dragon will eat you. That'll keep it
satiated for a while."

515
00:37:18,037 --> 00:37:20,112
It steps inside the cavern.

516
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,813
LAURA: (Grog voice) I think that's a no.

517
00:37:21,813 --> 00:37:25,853
FELICIA: Yeah. And I say (speaks gibberish). My
cat is your friend!

518
00:37:25,853 --> 00:37:27,857
TALIESIN: Bless you!

519
00:37:27,857 --> 00:37:34,948
MATT: (laughs) As you say that, one walks inside.
The one that you partially disintegrated earlier

520
00:37:34,948 --> 00:37:44,027
steps out and goes, (spitting noise) and spits a--
what in midair looks like liquid and then

521
00:37:44,027 --> 00:37:48,734
(shattering) shatters into almost like crystalline
ice as it hits the ground on a rock.

522
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:52,236
FELICIA: It is just rude. He smells so much like
feet.

523
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:56,212
SAM: We'll Mass Suggest that they take a bath
later.

524
00:37:56,212 --> 00:38:01,467
TALIESIN: Let's take a breather. For a moment,
collect ourselves.

525
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:04,743
LAURA: I wish I wouldn't have wasted a healing
potion just then because we can take some--

526
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:07,774
FELICIA: We can heal our 1d6 plus three.

527
00:38:07,774 --> 00:38:18,825
MATT: So as you guys step inside the cavern. You
guys are taking a short rest, currently?

528
00:38:18,825 --> 00:38:19,984
SAM: Short rest.

529
00:38:19,984 --> 00:38:25,203
MATT: All right, so the giants are just sitting
there waiting, arms crossed against the wall,

530
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:29,050
talking quietly to each other as the rest of you
sit down and bandage your wounds. You tend to your

531
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:34,560
adrenaline as it slowly wears off and suddenly the
pain starts to set in from some of the wounds

532
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,879
you've taken. So you guys can use as many hit dice
as you want to heal yourselves.

533
00:38:37,879 --> 00:38:40,176
MARY: So what do I do?

534
00:38:40,176 --> 00:38:44,656
LAURA: You roll a d8. You can roll up to 11d8,
plus two for each time.

535
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:47,989
SAM: Hey, DM.

536
00:38:47,989 --> 00:38:49,295
MATT: Yes?

537
00:38:49,295 --> 00:38:52,004
SAM: How many hit points do I have?

538
00:38:52,004 --> 00:38:55,516
MATT: You haven't taken damage at this point.

539
00:38:55,516 --> 00:38:58,340
SAM: Have they increased at all?

540
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,273
MATT: That is true. You leveled up after the last
one. So with this short rest I will say go ahead

541
00:39:01,273 --> 00:39:04,571
and roll an additional-- for a bard I think it is
a d8, correct?

542
00:39:04,571 --> 00:39:05,765
SAM: I don't know.

543
00:39:05,765 --> 00:39:07,355
MATT: What's your hit dice number?

544
00:39:07,355 --> 00:39:08,590
SAM: d8.

545
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,117
MATT: And what's your constitution?

546
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:12,290
SAM: 15. Plus two.

547
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:14,806
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll a d8 plus
two to it

548
00:39:14,806 --> 00:39:16,528
SAM: Four.

549
00:39:16,528 --> 00:39:19,578
MATT: All right, so you add four hit points to
your total hit point maximum.

550
00:39:19,578 --> 00:39:21,389
Welcome to level 11, Scanlan.

551
00:39:21,389 --> 00:39:29,073
(cheering and singing Super Mario victory ditty)

552
00:39:29,073 --> 00:39:31,112
MATT: You also get access to your first 6th-level
spell.

553
00:39:31,112 --> 00:39:32,432
MARY: What!?

554
00:39:32,432 --> 00:39:35,458
LAURA: What? Get some stuff before we fight a
dragon, yo.

555
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:37,445
SAM: I got it already. I am ready to rock.

556
00:39:37,445 --> 00:39:47,409
MATT: Good. Good choice. You take the next half an
hour or so to rest up. You still used your

557
00:39:47,409 --> 00:39:49,719
Disintegrate. You need to do a whole night's rest
to get that back.

558
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:54,115
FELICIA: Oh! I don't get it? It's six spell
levels.

559
00:39:54,115 --> 00:39:56,303
MATT: It is six spell levels you can get back on a
short rest?

560
00:39:56,303 --> 00:40:00,113
FELICIA: Short rest. Recover six spell levels
because I have arcane recovery. So I can actually

561
00:40:00,113 --> 00:40:01,030
get that back

562
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:04,287
MATT: (singing) Wizards are awesome!

563
00:40:04,287 --> 00:40:10,345
LAURA: (Grog voice) Grog would like to take his
Chain of Returning off of one of the axes he had

564
00:40:10,345 --> 00:40:16,759
it on and put onto the Firebrand Warhammer that he
took off of that dwarf in Kraghammer.

565
00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:20,448
MATT: All righty, I like it.

566
00:40:20,448 --> 00:40:23,380
LAURA: The mean guy he took it off.

567
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:28,674
MATT: Off of, that was King Murghol, I think,
wasn't it? The duergar king you fought in the

568
00:40:28,674 --> 00:40:31,031
Underdark.

569
00:40:31,031 --> 00:40:36,636
MARY: I have a question. So I rolled to get my
health back and I got more hit points than I had

570
00:40:36,636 --> 00:40:37,510
before--

571
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:40,057
MATT: You can't go more than your maximum. You're
at full hit points now.

572
00:40:40,057 --> 00:40:47,188
TALIESIN: I want to borrow Grog for just a second
and ask these two if they've encountered the

573
00:40:47,188 --> 00:40:51,854
dragon before, and what its disposition is.
Anything we should know.

574
00:40:51,854 --> 00:40:59,712
MATT: I want you to go ahead, and I will say
through Grog-- this is going to be interesting.

575
00:40:59,712 --> 00:41:11,116
Since Grog is translating, I'm going to go ahead
and have you roll a persuasion check.

576
00:41:11,116 --> 00:41:13,307
FELICIA: Wrong dice! Why did you use that dice?

577
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:15,135
TALIESIN: I was feeling weak. Ten.

578
00:41:15,135 --> 00:41:18,718
MATT: Ten. And I want you to roll a persuasion
check for Grog with disadvantage.

579
00:41:18,718 --> 00:41:27,155
LAURA: Great. Oh, that was a good roll, come on
also good roll.

580
00:41:27,155 --> 00:41:31,278
FELICIA: It wasn't a good roll. I see a face
there.

581
00:41:31,278 --> 00:41:33,787
TALIESIN: It was a one, wasn't it?

582
00:41:33,787 --> 00:41:36,478
LAURA: It was a one.

583
00:41:36,478 --> 00:41:39,722
MATT: All the crits were last week.

584
00:41:39,722 --> 00:41:43,089
TALIESIN: This is my fault. This is all my fault.

585
00:41:43,089 --> 00:41:48,042
FELICIA: You are a plague. Your good fortune is a
plague upon your friends.

586
00:41:48,042 --> 00:41:52,199
LAURA: Travis is going to be so pissed when he
gets here.

587
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:53,562
MATT: I know.

588
00:41:53,562 --> 00:41:55,707
SAM: He'll be dead by the time he gets here

589
00:41:55,707 --> 00:41:59,535
LAURA: His flight landed. I got a text. His flight
has landed. He's on his way.

590
00:41:59,535 --> 00:42:07,254
MATT: Great, awesome. As Grog finishes translating
(gibberish) to the giants, the giants chuckle to

591
00:42:07,254 --> 00:42:11,782
themselves and the other one says down to him,
what he translates for you, the equivalent of,

592
00:42:11,782 --> 00:42:20,905
"There's no help here. They killed our people, but
we're alive because we serve it. We'll bring you,

593
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:26,010
"like we promised, like we brought all the
others."

594
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:29,154
LAURA: They serve the dragon?

595
00:42:29,154 --> 00:42:32,998
FELICIA: Can we look around? Are there any dragon
tips around?

596
00:42:32,998 --> 00:42:37,212
MATT: You took a rest inside the cavern as you
just entered the mountain and at this point as you

597
00:42:37,212 --> 00:42:40,050
guys step up the giants are leading you further
into the cavern.

598
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,869
MARY: May I talk to him, as well?

599
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:43,440
MATT: You know Giant?

600
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,609
MARY: No, through Grog. I have telekinesis, so can
I speak to one of them?

601
00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:48,752
MATT: Well, telekinesis and telepathy are
different things.

602
00:42:48,752 --> 00:42:51,003
MARY: Oh, I mean, I have Awakened Mind.

603
00:42:51,003 --> 00:42:54,298
MATT: Oh right. So you can speak directly to their
minds

604
00:42:54,298 --> 00:43:02,876
MARY: Yes. Your people have been persecuted for so
long, and you have lost so many of the female

605
00:43:02,876 --> 00:43:10,396
version of you, and your children, and you serve
them now. Do you want to live as slaves?

606
00:43:10,396 --> 00:43:12,310
MATT: "We want to live."

607
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:16,026
MARY: So to live as a slave is better than--

608
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:18,426
MATT: "To not live at all?"

609
00:43:18,426 --> 00:43:26,023
MARY: We are offering you the opportunity to stop
your servitude. To end it forever.

610
00:43:26,023 --> 00:43:29,553
MATT: (grunts) They keep walking

611
00:43:29,553 --> 00:43:30,972
LAURA: What?

612
00:43:30,972 --> 00:43:42,281
MATT: We'll see how this plays out. This is a
process here. You guys heavily failed some early

613
00:43:42,281 --> 00:43:45,279
persuasion rolls here, they're in a very negative
position with you right now.

614
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:48,186
LAURA: Sorry about that.

615
00:43:48,186 --> 00:43:50,903
FELICIA: Let's not bring it up again. I love your
hair.

616
00:43:50,903 --> 00:43:53,430
SAM: It's really cool.

617
00:43:53,430 --> 00:44:00,785
MATT: So about 200 feet further into this cavern,
the tunnel opens up into a gargantuan natural rock

618
00:44:00,785 --> 00:44:08,148
chamber, coated in ice crystals across the
entirety of the rounded crag in the ceiling. You

619
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:12,815
can see now as the light you're bringing into-- by
the way, is anyone bringing a source of light

620
00:44:12,815 --> 00:44:14,203
other than the torchlight?

621
00:44:14,203 --> 00:44:15,808
LAURA: Yes, Grog lights his blazing axe.

622
00:44:15,931 --> 00:44:18,692
MARY: And I cast Light on my dark dragon staff.

623
00:44:18,692 --> 00:44:24,111
MATT: All right, so between the (whoosh) now the
fire that is now burning off of the warhammer and

624
00:44:24,111 --> 00:44:30,038
your Light spell, you can see as you enter
following these giants, there are definitely the

625
00:44:30,038 --> 00:44:35,397
remnants of a village here, a village that
was designed on the scale of these giants and

626
00:44:35,397 --> 00:44:41,357
while many of these structures still stand, it is
eerily quiet as you step inside. As you begin to

627
00:44:41,357 --> 00:44:44,748
step further into the center of this cavern, you
see many of these structures have been smashed and

628
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:50,437
destroyed and there is a layer of ice and snow
that has been carried in from various blizzard

629
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:55,909
winds or just the internal temperature in this
room. And the room is extremely cold. With the

630
00:44:55,909 --> 00:44:59,449
little bit of light you have, everyone's breath is
very clearly visible with each puff into the air

631
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:03,781
around, and you swear that in a few pockets here it is
so cold that you can hear the moisture from your

632
00:45:03,781 --> 00:45:09,131
breath coalesce and then shatter on the ground.
You all bundle up even tighter

633
00:45:09,131 --> 00:45:10,434
with your various furs.

634
00:45:10,434 --> 00:45:12,151
LAURA: I snuggle very close to Trinket.

635
00:45:12,151 --> 00:45:16,333
MATT: Trinket snuggles very close to you because
Trinket, while made for this type of temperature,

636
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:19,029
is still uncomfortably cold, even at this point.

637
00:45:19,029 --> 00:45:21,330
SAM: Did Lyra give me--

638
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:26,124
FELICIA: I did! I gave you my stone. My
Transmutation Stone, which helps you resist cold.

639
00:45:26,124 --> 00:45:28,767
SAM: Wow, I feel so warm and cuddly.

640
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:33,968
FELICIA: Well, don't brag about it. Oh my gosh, my
mom told me never bring-- well, she's dead, but

641
00:45:33,968 --> 00:45:39,711
before she died, she told me if you can't bring
one for everybody, don't bring any. So just be

642
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,795
quiet about it.

643
00:45:40,795 --> 00:45:44,503
SAM: Okay. I'm sorry. I was just distracted
because we're in a dire situation and I miss the

644
00:45:44,503 --> 00:45:48,815
love of my life, Pike. I'm sure you can't identify
with that.

645
00:45:48,815 --> 00:45:53,651
FELICIA: Oh no! I was just thinking the other day,
just outside the cavern, if Aldor was here--

646
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:54,641
SAM: Aldor?

647
00:45:54,641 --> 00:45:55,896
FELICIA: Yes! Did I tell you about him?

648
00:45:55,896 --> 00:45:57,022
SAM: A little.

649
00:45:57,022 --> 00:46:03,566
FELICIA: He smells like sandalwood and
dismissiveness, but that's okay.

650
00:46:03,566 --> 00:46:05,233
We'll get over that.

651
00:46:05,233 --> 00:46:10,394
SAM: Well, we have something in common then and
thank you for your stone of warmth

652
00:46:10,394 --> 00:46:11,614
or whatever it was.

653
00:46:11,614 --> 00:46:12,900
FELICIA: It's a cold resistance.

654
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,377
SAM: I'll just call it a stone of warmth.

655
00:46:16,377 --> 00:46:19,526
MATT: There is no character class more dangerous
in DND than mother.

656
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:22,087
(laughter)

657
00:46:22,087 --> 00:46:27,805
MATT: Do not have children if you are ever in a
fantasy genre or anything.

658
00:46:27,805 --> 00:46:29,865
You ain't getting past 30.

659
00:46:29,865 --> 00:46:33,956
MARY: May I again, sorry, use Awakened Mind to ask
the giant what happened here?

660
00:46:33,956 --> 00:46:41,046
MATT: As they begin walking through and looking
about, one of them starts giving you these images,

661
00:46:41,046 --> 00:46:48,743
and it's less of a language and it's more of a
series of memories. And you see visions of a time

662
00:46:48,743 --> 00:46:57,945
not long ago. Months, even years. This relatively
thriving village of frost giants that had

663
00:46:57,945 --> 00:47:02,780
essentially claimed this mountain as their own
for generations. Hunting in the nearby Vesper

664
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:10,957
Timberland, occasionally harrowing the traveling
merchant band heading up the Glasswalk Path or

665
00:47:10,957 --> 00:47:17,431
various other entities that live in this forest.
They're not by any means a good people. They exist

666
00:47:17,431 --> 00:47:26,291
and they take what they want, but it appears that
not long ago this dragon decided that it wanted to

667
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:31,732
live here instead. And you see visions of it
stalking through the tunnels, carving its way

668
00:47:31,732 --> 00:47:37,766
through the ice and ambushing this frost giant
village. You see visions of it tearing into

669
00:47:37,766 --> 00:47:44,637
families of them and freezing them on the spot,
which is interesting because you see, these giants

670
00:47:44,637 --> 00:47:50,642
seem pretty well-adapted to ice and cold
weather. It seems it is less of a freezing them

671
00:47:50,642 --> 00:47:53,614
physically and more of locking them into place.
And as you see these visions, you begin to step

672
00:47:53,614 --> 00:47:59,807
further into this village and you can see there
are spires, large spires of crystallized ice, and

673
00:47:59,807 --> 00:48:04,866
loosely within the shadows of the ice you can see
what looks like the suffocated forms of frost

674
00:48:04,866 --> 00:48:13,864
giants that are locked in that position under many
feet of ice. You see most of this village brought

675
00:48:13,864 --> 00:48:22,020
to its knees and destroyed, murdered, eaten, or
imprisoned and these two, essentially chosen to

676
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:28,188
survive and given the order to bring what this
creature wants.

677
00:48:28,188 --> 00:48:30,398
MARY: There's only two of you left?

678
00:48:30,398 --> 00:48:40,416
MATT: You get this sense of sadness and fear, but
also a sense of a lack of any other option.

679
00:48:40,416 --> 00:48:43,074
MARY: Oh, how I wish we could release you from
these bonds.

680
00:48:43,074 --> 00:48:48,527
LAURA: Is there a way to, like, melt the spires?
(whispers) I interrupted you.

681
00:48:48,527 --> 00:48:50,545
MARY: To release them.

682
00:48:50,545 --> 00:48:54,738
FELICIA: They are dead in there though, right?

683
00:48:54,738 --> 00:48:59,020
MARY: No, I know but at least maybe they could--
Do you have some burial ritual or anything that

684
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:04,349
you would like to or do these stand as a painful
remembrance for you?

685
00:49:04,349 --> 00:49:10,757
MATT: There is a moment where it seems almost like
it's going to answer, and then the mind closes off

686
00:49:10,757 --> 00:49:17,659
suddenly. There is a defensiveness and these
entities, you get the sense that even this

687
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:23,712
tenuous relationship you have built with them is
based purely on arcane persuasion, and the more

688
00:49:23,712 --> 00:49:29,848
you pry, the more you begin to test the boundaries
of what you have done. Pick and choose your words

689
00:49:29,848 --> 00:49:31,174
very carefully.

690
00:49:31,174 --> 00:49:39,661
MARY: Zahra sheds a tear, which freezes instantly
on her face, and her internal flame melts it off.

691
00:49:39,661 --> 00:49:42,062
LAURA: That's pretty badass.

692
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:50,730
MATT: As you continue to walk, you can see the center
of this village is completely in tatters. A lot of

693
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:57,713
the wood and the dried brush and the furs and
thick leathers that these giants had gathered and

694
00:49:57,713 --> 00:50:03,229
constructed their civilization out of is all just
shattered and rended to the floor and then

695
00:50:03,229 --> 00:50:10,721
frozen over, left in this weird picturesque,
almost a tapestry. A frozen moment in time of

696
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:19,373
utter desolation. Actually, I want you to all to
roll a perception check, if you could.

697
00:50:19,373 --> 00:50:26,323
TALIESIN: 17.

698
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:27,386
FELICIA: 14.

699
00:50:27,386 --> 00:50:28,343
SAM: 20.

700
00:50:28,343 --> 00:50:30,352
LAURA: Oh! No we're not in-- 14.

701
00:50:30,352 --> 00:50:33,128
MARY: Uno.

702
00:50:33,128 --> 00:50:38,550
MATT: Wow, getting the ones out. So as you guys
are walking forward, Scanlan, you notice that

703
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:46,071
there is, just outside the light perception
stepping forward, a lot of the rubble has been

704
00:50:46,071 --> 00:50:55,410
pushed and coalesced into a central monolith.
Almost like a 25, 30 foot sculpture of chaos. All

705
00:50:55,410 --> 00:51:01,892
of these things have been matted together with
what looks like mud and refuse, and as you guys

706
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:08,130
begin to notice this, too, you catch the framing
of the light on it and it seems to be built into

707
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:17,693
almost an altar or a large sculpture of worship of
a winged dragon creature that is currently in the

708
00:51:17,693 --> 00:51:24,961
process of swooping down. You get the sensation
that this was built as, essentially, a place of

709
00:51:24,961 --> 00:51:33,001
offering to this white dragon, and hopefully a
symbol to keep themselves alive and to prove their

710
00:51:33,001 --> 00:51:35,383
fealty to this entity.

711
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:41,234
FELICIA: I have a spell called Legend Lore. Can I
cast that on white dragon?

712
00:51:41,234 --> 00:51:45,900
MATT: Let's see what Legend Lore does.

713
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:50,222
FELICIA: The spell brings to your mind a brief
summary of the significant lore about the thing

714
00:51:50,222 --> 00:51:55,838
you named: current tales, forgotten stories,
secret lore that has never been widely known. If

715
00:51:55,838 --> 00:51:59,489
it is not of legendary importance, you gain no
information. Would I think that this is a

716
00:51:59,489 --> 00:52:01,117
legendary dragon?

717
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:05,325
MATT: Okay. As you take a moment and everyone stops
to look around, you notice that Lyra is sitting there

718
00:52:05,325 --> 00:52:08,570
currently muttering to herself and putting her
fingers through the air, and you can see these

719
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:14,029
small arcane sigils begin to flash in the air
where she places her hands, at which point her eyes

720
00:52:14,029 --> 00:52:22,656
glaze over with this shimmering gold energy and
she seems to go into a trance. Now, what you first

721
00:52:22,656 --> 00:52:29,848
are hit with is the image of darkness, black and
struggle, a struggle to push, a struggle to exist,

722
00:52:29,848 --> 00:52:36,240
a struggle to survive, and then suddenly light.
You see the cracking of something releasing, and

723
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:42,275
from there pulling forth from this singular egg,
the only one left of its clutch, a white dragon

724
00:52:42,275 --> 00:52:48,900
wyrmling pulling itself out of the egg. This, you
immediately sense, is the dragon that now resides

725
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,860
within this mountain.

726
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:57,189
You begin to see flashes in time of it struggling
to survive in the frozen tundra to the north,

727
00:52:57,189 --> 00:53:02,973
desperately trying to escape poachers and
individuals trying to hunt it, whether to protect

728
00:53:02,973 --> 00:53:10,802
their own villages or to use its physical body
parts in some sort of sale. You get the sense that

729
00:53:10,802 --> 00:53:17,797
at one point it was already the target of some
contract that failed. For a brief second, you see

730
00:53:17,797 --> 00:53:25,345
a flash of a frozen cavern recently, and a few
individuals locked in an icy prison bitten down on

731
00:53:25,345 --> 00:53:31,242
and shattered before it cuts to black again. You
begin to see moments of this dragon growing, and

732
00:53:31,242 --> 00:53:38,403
with each stage in its physical transformation
towards becoming a full-fledged adult dragon there

733
00:53:38,403 --> 00:53:47,843
is just spite, there is anger, there is ego, there
is a severe sense of self-importance, a lust for

734
00:53:47,843 --> 00:53:55,807
others to bow before, serve, or feed it. And you
have heard and you have read many things about

735
00:53:55,807 --> 00:54:00,453
dragons and you have heard things of great
intelligence and articulate entities that even,

736
00:54:00,453 --> 00:54:09,717
good or evil themselves, have this extremely
intelligent presence. This dragon is far more

737
00:54:09,717 --> 00:54:14,558
feral and bestial than anything you've read about.
It has an intelligence, but it seems to not be

738
00:54:14,558 --> 00:54:19,910
concerned with the intricacies of conversation as
much as it is to bend everything to its will and

739
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:24,590
to give (voices deepens) to me. (normally) And the
one thing that catches your mind before the spell

740
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:30,530
ends is the name that it finally came upon itself,
the name that it heard whispered as one of its

741
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:33,667
would-be hunters was suddenly--

742
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:34,793
SAM: Jeff.

743
00:54:34,793 --> 00:54:36,215
(laughter)

744
00:54:36,215 --> 00:54:41,470
MATT: Jeff the dragon. The name Rimefang rings
through your mind.

745
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:46,174
FELICIA: His name is Rimefang.

746
00:54:46,174 --> 00:54:55,347
MATT: The two frost giants stop their walking and
turn. "Rimefang." They nod and look up to the

747
00:54:55,347 --> 00:54:57,270
giant structure they constructed.

748
00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:01,696
FELICIA: Oh wow! Can I make a history to sww if I know
anyone in the guild who has been named Rimefang?

749
00:55:01,696 --> 00:55:05,422
MATT: Make a history check on this.

750
00:55:05,422 --> 00:55:06,852
FELICIA: It's a 21.

751
00:55:06,852 --> 00:55:13,663
MATT: Okay, Rimefang, you gather, is the name of
the dragon proper. And there's another drink for

752
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:16,305
you guys out there. They made fun of me for using
the word proper.

753
00:55:16,305 --> 00:55:18,611
SAM: Drink!

754
00:55:18,611 --> 00:55:30,153
MATT: This dragon took the name Rimefang. Because
in a lot of dragons as they evolve and begin to

755
00:55:30,153 --> 00:55:37,162
really create a lair, they really make themselves
known publicly and really draw the fear out once

756
00:55:37,162 --> 00:55:40,186
they feel they're in a comfortable position. You
feel this dragon is just starting to get to that

757
00:55:40,186 --> 00:55:46,561
point where it's eager to drive fear into the
local populace. From your history check, you do

758
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:52,288
know that there is, somewhere in the books you've
gone through, a similar contract, nothing Rimefang

759
00:55:52,288 --> 00:55:58,116
related, but there was a white dragon that was
supposedly hunted about eight, nine months back,

760
00:55:58,116 --> 00:56:05,074
and the team never returned. And you begin to
think, "Wait, so if a team of really practiced

761
00:56:05,074 --> 00:56:11,899
"people never returned from this contract, and we
were sent on this as an entry level..."

762
00:56:11,899 --> 00:56:19,551
FELICIA: Hey, guys? I have a suspicion that maybe
the guild didn't want us to succeed. And I don't

763
00:56:19,551 --> 00:56:25,081
want to panic anybody. I just don't think
Vanessa--

764
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:28,134
MARY: Lyra, do you have any enemies in the guild?

765
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:36,277
FELICIA: Well. Everyone seems to be very-- I make
a very good soup and I help people with their

766
00:56:36,277 --> 00:56:37,594
laundry sometimes and--

767
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:39,004
LAURA: Oh, are you like an assistant?

768
00:56:39,004 --> 00:56:42,305
FELICIA: No, I'm a guild member, I just like to be
helpful. Like you guys.

769
00:56:42,305 --> 00:56:43,964
LAURA: I was just wondering.

770
00:56:43,964 --> 00:56:47,505
FELICIA: Well, they just don't send me anywhere.
It's a paperwork thing.

771
00:56:47,505 --> 00:56:55,264
MARY: If you don't mind my asking because I do
respect you so much, how did your captainship of

772
00:56:55,264 --> 00:56:58,417
our crew come about?

773
00:56:58,417 --> 00:57:02,331
FELICIA: Well, I got a missive, I got a scroll in
my room and the first assignment. I mean, it was

774
00:57:02,331 --> 00:57:06,123
very exciting to me and they haven't really paid
attention to me. Mertin is very nice to me but

775
00:57:06,123 --> 00:57:14,401
Vanessa-- she just has her days, and I've been
asking her for so long, and finally I got my

776
00:57:14,401 --> 00:57:20,253
assignment. I was hoping Aldor would be here, but
he isn't, and that's fine. It'll be the next one.

777
00:57:20,253 --> 00:57:25,458
But there may not be a next one, guys. That's what
I'm saying.

778
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:30,525
MARY: Oh, were you Vanessa's assistant? I mean,
before you were a member?

779
00:57:30,525 --> 00:57:33,248
FELICIA: No. Aldor. I'm here with Aldor,
remember?

780
00:57:33,248 --> 00:57:37,917
SAM: If you think we've been sent on some sort of
suicide mission--

781
00:57:37,917 --> 00:57:39,557
FELICIA: Oh, that's good, the way you put it
there!

782
00:57:39,557 --> 00:57:47,503
SAM: Well, I'm a master of words. Should we
abandon all hope and just flee? Is that what

783
00:57:47,503 --> 00:57:52,231
you're suggesting as our leader? Or should we
carry it through and prove everyone wrong?

784
00:57:52,231 --> 00:57:57,639
FELICIA: If we abandon this quest, then we never--
I could get kicked out of the guild, for one.

785
00:57:57,639 --> 00:58:05,166
LAURA: What happens if the contract that we
magically signed doesn't ever come to fruition?

786
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:11,259
FELICIA: It's not good. Let me think.

787
00:58:11,259 --> 00:58:15,684
SAM: You know what? Retrace your steps.

788
00:58:15,684 --> 00:58:23,099
MATT: There you go. In Memento fashion, all these
things flash through. If a contract is broken,

789
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:28,377
one: if you're a member of the guild, you're
kicked out of the guild. Two: you guys are on

790
00:58:28,377 --> 00:58:35,255
this essentially as a trial basis to prevent
being arrested and put on trial for breaking

791
00:58:35,255 --> 00:58:39,508
the laws of the city of Vasselheim and essentially
hunting creatures that aren't sanctified. Or you

792
00:58:39,508 --> 00:58:42,948
yourself have not been sanctified to kill, which
goes against guild rules and the city itself.

793
00:58:42,948 --> 00:58:49,406
Which means if you were to not succeed at the
contract, you would probably be put on trial at the

794
00:58:49,406 --> 00:58:50,746
seat of judgment.

795
00:58:50,746 --> 00:58:53,188
LAURA: Percy is very good at lawyering.

796
00:58:53,188 --> 00:58:59,686
TALIESIN: I am. I lawyer quite well, but the hope
is that we wouldn't actually break the contract in

797
00:58:59,686 --> 00:59:02,528
the first place, because that's complicated.

798
00:59:02,528 --> 00:59:11,734
MARY: I wasn't part of this band of breaking the
law. I'm here to gain entry into this guild.

799
00:59:11,734 --> 00:59:14,034
FELICIA: Well, you certainly won't get into the
guild if you break the contract.

800
00:59:14,034 --> 00:59:21,014
MARY: No, I completely understand, but I won't be
brought to trial. Not that I'm all, "well it's all

801
00:59:21,014 --> 00:59:25,259
about me," but I'm serious. That's why I'm here!
My motivations are not to save my ass, my

802
00:59:25,259 --> 00:59:28,024
motivations are to get into this bloody guild!

803
00:59:28,024 --> 00:59:33,883
TALIESIN: We're not here based on other people's
expectations. We're here because we thought we

804
00:59:33,883 --> 00:59:37,156
could handle this and nothing has changed. This
changes nothing!

805
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:39,530
LAURA: We are very capable fighters!

806
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:45,879
MARY: I've seen this. You have proven yourselves
already. Those orcs didn't stand a bloody chance.

807
00:59:45,879 --> 00:59:49,382
TALIESIN: Thank you.

808
00:59:49,382 --> 00:59:51,842
FELICIA: So we go?

809
00:59:51,842 --> 00:59:57,635
SAM: We go. Well actually, Grog-- could someone
ask Ace and Gary if we're there or if we have

810
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:58,983
further to travel?

811
00:59:58,983 --> 01:00:00,229
FELICIA: We'll just keep going.

812
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:03,647
MATT: As Grog mentions this, you guys have moved
past most of the village, and you've gone towards

813
01:00:03,647 --> 01:00:10,970
the back of this large chamber, and you do see
what appears to be a tunnel that ascends upwards,

814
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:19,134
deeper into the mountain proper. See, did it
again. It's made me all self-conscious. But the

815
01:00:19,134 --> 01:00:25,879
entrance is entirely frozen. There is a wall of
solid ice between yourselves and the continuation

816
01:00:25,879 --> 01:00:27,187
of this tunnel.

817
01:00:27,187 --> 01:00:28,658
LAURA: (Grog voice) How thick is it?

818
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:30,863
MATT: It's hard to see how thick it is from this
side.

819
01:00:30,863 --> 01:00:34,150
LAURA: (Grog voice) Can Grog run at it and try to
bash it really fast?

820
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:39,729
MATT: So as you guys step up, Grog runs ahead of
the rest of the giants and goes as hard as he can

821
01:00:39,729 --> 01:00:46,009
towards this. (laughs) So swinging with the axe
towards the ice. Go ahead and

822
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,366
make an attack roll.

823
01:00:47,366 --> 01:00:49,899
LAURA: It's a hammer, which I feel would be better
against ice.

824
01:00:49,899 --> 01:00:54,160
MATT: This giant flaming warhammer from King
Murghol.

825
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,006
LAURA: I feel like every dice is betraying me.

826
01:00:56,006 --> 01:00:57,496
TALIESIN: Would you like to use mine?

827
01:00:57,496 --> 01:00:59,328
LAURA: No, I'm going to curse yours.

828
01:00:59,328 --> 01:01:02,411
MATT: No, turn it around. Shake the Wil Wheaton
curse.

829
01:01:02,411 --> 01:01:07,191
LAURA: I'll just leave it at that. It slipped out
of my hands, but I'm going to keep it. 15 plus

830
01:01:07,191 --> 01:01:08,537
what, eight? Plus nine?

831
01:01:08,537 --> 01:01:11,154
MATT: Plus nine. That'll definitely hit. Go ahead
and roll damage for that.

832
01:01:11,154 --> 01:01:13,575
LAURA: Okay. Here we go.

833
01:01:13,575 --> 01:01:15,558
SAM: I hope he can hit a wall.

834
01:01:15,558 --> 01:01:26,020
LAURA: I don't know, with my ones as of late. Oh,
that's just ten.

835
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:28,881
MATT: Ten damage? Including the fire damage?

836
01:01:28,881 --> 01:01:33,545
LAURA: Oh, yes, right. 13.

837
01:01:33,545 --> 01:01:40,883
MATT: 13 damage. (whack) The warhammer streaks
through, the light causing this interesting

838
01:01:40,883 --> 01:01:46,257
shifting of the radius around it. As it smacks
into the ice with this resounding (thwack) sound,

839
01:01:46,257 --> 01:01:52,003
the ice shakes and shimmers. A giant crack forms
up the front of it, and you can see as he (grunts)

840
01:01:52,003 --> 01:01:57,055
pulls it out, the wall itself seems to have
largely crumbled in the small space there and

841
01:01:57,055 --> 01:02:00,332
looks very fragile. But it's definitely left an
impact on the wall.

842
01:02:00,332 --> 01:02:05,698
TALIESIN: I can make an attempt at this. I'm going
to walk over and study the shattering position and

843
01:02:05,698 --> 01:02:07,714
see if I can find the weak point in the wall.

844
01:02:07,714 --> 01:02:09,880
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an investigation
check.

845
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:16,915
TALIESIN: Seven. Getting it all out of my system
now.

846
01:02:16,915 --> 01:02:25,442
MATT: The ice wall itself is not a specific
architectural structure. It is made of some sort

847
01:02:25,442 --> 01:02:30,493
of blasting of ice that froze the air in that way,
so it doesn't have any real geometric positioning,

848
01:02:30,493 --> 01:02:34,424
but the ice structure itself, you're unable to
make out what would be a weak point or not, other

849
01:02:34,424 --> 01:02:37,578
than the place of impact where Grog placed the
hammer.

850
01:02:37,578 --> 01:02:43,567
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a musket ball, go over
to the very center of the crack.

851
01:02:43,567 --> 01:02:45,878
LAURA: Should we keep a little more quiet than
that?

852
01:02:45,878 --> 01:02:48,215
FELICIA: Can I use a Fire Bolt? That would be
good, a Fire Bolt.

853
01:02:48,215 --> 01:02:49,626
TALIESIN: Let's save the Fire Bolt.

854
01:02:49,626 --> 01:02:55,058
FELICIA: No, it's a cantrip. Is that okay?

855
01:02:55,058 --> 01:02:56,504
TALIESIN: I'm backing up.

856
01:02:56,504 --> 01:02:58,388
FELICIA: I'm the leader. I'm going to say I'm
going to.

857
01:02:58,388 --> 01:03:00,344
TALIESIN: She said, Fire Bolt. I backed away.

858
01:03:00,344 --> 01:03:06,658
FELICIA: And that is 1d8 fire damage, which is
seven. Seven fire damage.

859
01:03:06,658 --> 01:03:11,342
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll to see if you
hit with it. So roll and add your spell attack

860
01:03:11,342 --> 01:03:12,590
modifier.

861
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:18,358
FELICIA: What is that? Oh, it's 12... plus 11. So
that is 23.

862
01:03:18,358 --> 01:03:21,140
MATT: All right, that definitely hits. How much
damage? That was seven fire damage, you said?

863
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:28,887
FELICIA: Oh, it's 3d10 fire. Sorry. Because of my
level. Which is seven and five and seven is 19.

864
01:03:28,887 --> 01:03:37,381
MATT: Clutching your staff at one side, the book's
under your shoulder, you bring your hand out and

865
01:03:37,381 --> 01:03:42,618
withdraw your hand with the force of the blast of
the Fire Bolt going forward. As it smacks into the

866
01:03:42,618 --> 01:03:47,837
section where Grog had slammed the hammer, (boof)
it bursts as a flash of arcane reddish fiery

867
01:03:47,837 --> 01:03:53,812
energy, and the wall itself shatters inward and
starts falling and crumbling nearby. Now, this

868
01:03:53,812 --> 01:03:58,762
tall wall, which was about 25 feet tall, begins to
fall in giant chunks.

869
01:03:58,762 --> 01:04:00,707
FELICIA: (yelps) Sorry!

870
01:04:00,707 --> 01:04:07,656
MATT: I'm going to go ahead and have Lyra and
Percy and Grog all make dexterity saving throws.

871
01:04:07,656 --> 01:04:11,001
FELICIA: Oh, I'm so good at that, with the
negatives. Oh!

872
01:04:11,001 --> 01:04:13,809
LAURA: 19!

873
01:04:13,809 --> 01:04:15,316
TALIESIN: I can't use acrobatics?

874
01:04:15,316 --> 01:04:16,806
MATT: No, not for this.

875
01:04:16,806 --> 01:04:18,440
LAURA: 21 for Grog.

876
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:25,657
FELICIA: I rolled a zero, because I've got a
negative two. It's not even on the dice!

877
01:04:25,657 --> 01:04:26,926
MATT: Percy?

878
01:04:26,926 --> 01:04:28,097
TALIESIN: Nine.

879
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:29,980
MATT: All right, so.

880
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:31,639
FELICIA: Is that worse than a critical fail?

881
01:04:31,639 --> 01:04:37,283
MATT: As the whole wall just (shattering noise)
breaking and falling down around you, you all go

882
01:04:37,283 --> 01:04:43,284
rushing backward. Grog, strangely and
unexpectedly, shoulder-rolls out of the way, epic

883
01:04:43,284 --> 01:04:51,265
Geordi La Forge style. Escapes the crumbling wall.
Unfortunately, though, Lyra and Percy stumble

884
01:04:51,265 --> 01:04:55,735
backward, slipping on the ice that's actually
coated the floor of this cavern, and get impacted

885
01:04:55,735 --> 01:04:59,143
with part of the fall. It's not too bad, but both
of you suffer 14 points of cold damage and

886
01:04:59,143 --> 01:05:03,712
bludgeoning. Cold and bludgeoning, as the wall
comes tumbling down on you. However, the rest of

887
01:05:03,712 --> 01:05:09,582
the cavern now lies open with pieces of jagged ice
almost like a broken glass window itself framing

888
01:05:09,582 --> 01:05:11,089
the exterior of this tunnel.

889
01:05:11,089 --> 01:05:14,181
FELICIA: I'm not going to go to the front anymore,
guys.

890
01:05:14,181 --> 01:05:15,935
SAM: Well, you're the leader, shouldn't you be--

891
01:05:15,935 --> 01:05:19,506
LAURA: We should protect her. She should be
towards the back.

892
01:05:19,506 --> 01:05:21,230
TALIESIN: I'm going to heal really quickly.

893
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:22,738
MATT: Take another short rest?

894
01:05:22,738 --> 01:05:26,265
LAURA: We should take a short rest so that we're
going in, you know.

895
01:05:26,265 --> 01:05:29,905
FELICIA: Yeah. I had scoliosis as a child. I'm not
nimble. It's funny.

896
01:05:29,905 --> 01:05:35,777
MARY: Before we take a short rest may I, again,
use Awakened Mind, just to see

897
01:05:35,777 --> 01:05:38,892
how far away we are.

898
01:05:38,892 --> 01:05:49,300
MATT: You get an image of a slowly ascending and
spiraling tunnel that ascends towards an upper

899
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:54,801
cavern at the top of the mountain. The upper
cavern you only get a few glimpses of as they

900
01:05:54,801 --> 01:06:01,406
themselves have only had a few glimpses of it, but
it appears this is not the only

901
01:06:01,406 --> 01:06:03,344
obstacle in the way.

902
01:06:03,344 --> 01:06:04,739
MARY: Oh, good.

903
01:06:04,739 --> 01:06:07,788
SAM: Let's carry on then.

904
01:06:07,788 --> 01:06:12,883
LAURA: Could you see when you were looking into
their mind if it is open or if it is just a big

905
01:06:12,883 --> 01:06:13,968
cavern?

906
01:06:13,968 --> 01:06:16,103
MARY: I could not see.

907
01:06:16,103 --> 01:06:24,853
MATT: From the best vantage point you could see,
it was a chamber about, I'd say 80 to 85 feet to

908
01:06:24,853 --> 01:06:30,636
the ceiling, lined with jagged ice crystals that 
are coalesced in a temperature so cold that it's

909
01:06:30,636 --> 01:06:38,052
almost like the inside of a geode, but it's all
made of ice. But you see multiple platforms that

910
01:06:38,052 --> 01:06:43,540
are risen in the walls of this, and in the center,
there is a singular platform, and there sitting on

911
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:50,697
the top of it is apparently the dragon quarry you
seek. And then the image shuts itself out, as one

912
01:06:50,697 --> 01:06:56,182
of them glances over the shoulder. It's growing
uncomfortable with sharing information.

913
01:06:56,182 --> 01:06:58,560
MARY: Got it. I thank him in my mind.

914
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:04,957
MATT: All right. Pressing forward, you can see one
giant still dragging itself forward with a portion

915
01:07:04,957 --> 01:07:09,010
of its physical body essentially gutted.

916
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:14,357
MARY: What if we gave him a half healing potion?

917
01:07:14,357 --> 01:07:17,557
SAM: Don't mess with the magic.

918
01:07:17,557 --> 01:07:23,366
LAURA: Because, here's the thing. If they fight
with us, it's great, but if they turn on us then

919
01:07:23,366 --> 01:07:25,267
we are going to have to fight them at full power
again.

920
01:07:25,267 --> 01:07:26,794
MARY: Yeah, but we have 24 hours.

921
01:07:26,794 --> 01:07:33,525
SAM: Yes, but the healing potion might do
something. Let's just keep going. You are a very

922
01:07:33,525 --> 01:07:35,037
kind soul.

923
01:07:35,037 --> 01:07:39,547
MATT: So are you guys taking a short rest to heal
up? Okay. If you haven't already rolled your

924
01:07:39,547 --> 01:07:46,109
dice-- You healed up now? Perfect. All right, so
as you guys continue to trudge up this extremely

925
01:07:46,109 --> 01:07:55,734
cold-- let me see. I think it'll be a fun one
to-- There we go. You guys continue to ascend up

926
01:07:55,734 --> 01:08:00,400
this pitch-black cavern here. It appears that both
the giants and the dragon do not need light to

927
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:08,904
make their way through this cavern structure. So
you are the small beads of visual lightness in the

928
01:08:08,904 --> 01:08:15,310
entire structure. The floor itself is slick, and
there are bits of rough rock that you can find

929
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:19,597
foot purchase but there are a few moments where 
some of you slip and you lose about ten feet and

930
01:08:19,597 --> 01:08:24,922
then catch yourself and have to move upward with
this slight 35-degree incline, slowly spiraling

931
01:08:24,922 --> 01:08:36,855
upward. You push forward for about 30 minutes or
so in this long, seemingly-- for lack of a better

932
01:08:36,855 --> 01:08:42,631
term, there isn't a lot of changed variation to it;
it's just a gradual spiral in itself.

933
01:08:42,631 --> 01:08:46,461
LAURA: I want to keep perception out to make sure
that nothing is ahead of us.

934
01:08:46,461 --> 01:08:49,451
MATT: Go ahead and roll a perception check.

935
01:08:49,451 --> 01:09:06,913
LAURA: Okay, but this is pertaining to dragons. He
is one of my favored enemies, so I have

936
01:09:06,913 --> 01:09:13,129
additional bonuses to tracking him and insight
against him. Favored enemies!

937
01:09:13,129 --> 01:09:16,200
MATT: All right. So you're perceiving anything
dragon-related and things that would be a

938
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,227
forewarning of a dragon, okay.

939
01:09:18,227 --> 01:09:20,881
LAURA: Things he would have laid down for us.
Stuff like that.

940
01:09:20,881 --> 01:09:26,653
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll again. You have an
advantage.

941
01:09:26,653 --> 01:09:29,526
LAURA: You know, just to see. Okay. 18?

942
01:09:29,526 --> 01:09:35,734
MATT: Okay. Glancing about, you do see there are
claw marks along the walls, you can see where

943
01:09:35,734 --> 01:09:45,498
portions of this cavern were carved out by the
claws of Rimefang. You can see that occasionally

944
01:09:45,498 --> 01:09:58,752
there are pieces of frozen rock that are solid
ice, some that appear to be an unthawed chunk of

945
01:09:58,752 --> 01:10:07,604
flesh of some kind. As you push further up this
cavern, you spot what looks like the lower half of

946
01:10:07,604 --> 01:10:08,670
a statue.

947
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:14,978
FELICIA: Ugh. That's a-- oh my god.

948
01:10:14,978 --> 01:10:16,457
TALIESIN: That's unpleasant.

949
01:10:16,457 --> 01:10:18,474
LAURA: Half of a giant, right?

950
01:10:18,474 --> 01:10:27,724
MATT: This appears to be a frost giant that met
its end. The actual lower half of the torso itself

951
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:36,922
is giving off a stench of slowly rotting flesh.
There is ice encasing the lower half of it. It's

952
01:10:36,922 --> 01:10:42,565
interesting because the physical form of the frost
giants resist cold naturally, and this temperature

953
01:10:42,565 --> 01:10:50,493
would normally freeze any other flesh completely
solid. Here, it naturally decays. But there is a

954
01:10:50,493 --> 01:10:54,434
distinct place where the torso was removed
forcibly by what looks like a series of daggers

955
01:10:54,434 --> 01:10:55,940
and/or dragon's teeth.

956
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:58,245
FELICIA: I have little ginger chews, if anybody
wants one.

957
01:10:58,245 --> 01:10:59,375
TALIESIN: I'll take one.

958
01:10:59,375 --> 01:11:03,058
FELICIA: Here you go. Thank you. Just in my little
pack here.

959
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:09,473
MATT: About ten more minutes of walking, you come
upon another frozen wall barrier.

960
01:11:09,473 --> 01:11:12,792
SAM: I will check it for traps!

961
01:11:12,792 --> 01:11:14,553
MATT: Go ahead and roll perception.

962
01:11:14,553 --> 01:11:17,343
LAURA: (laughs) Thanks, brother.

963
01:11:17,343 --> 01:11:18,751
SAM: Five.

964
01:11:18,751 --> 01:11:24,569
MATT: As far as you can tell, it is a
frost/snow-covered ground with walls and a

965
01:11:24,569 --> 01:11:25,334
ceiling.

966
01:11:25,334 --> 01:11:27,483
SAM: Everyone. There are definitely no traps
here.

967
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:29,967
LAURA: Oh, good. Maybe we should stay back?

968
01:11:29,967 --> 01:11:35,789
FELICIA: Maybe I could do the Fire Bolt from afar.
That's a good idea, and a leader idea that I had

969
01:11:35,789 --> 01:11:37,310
that you just reminded me of.

970
01:11:37,310 --> 01:11:40,406
LAURA: Good thinking, Lyra.

971
01:11:40,406 --> 01:11:44,701
FELICIA: Thank you. Oh, that definitely hits.
That's 28.

972
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:46,813
MATT: 28. Go ahead and roll damage.

973
01:11:46,813 --> 01:11:51,526
FELICIA: It's a nine and a ten and five. 24.

974
01:11:51,526 --> 01:11:58,143
MATT: 24. So as you focus, close one eye, and aim,
you release a secondary Fire Bolt. (boosh) It

975
01:11:58,143 --> 01:12:03,975
slams into the front of the wall of ice, which
immediately bursts inside. Shattered shards of

976
01:12:03,975 --> 01:12:08,246
glass-like ice go flying further up the cavern.
The rest of it falls and collapses at a distance,

977
01:12:08,246 --> 01:12:12,488
(crashing) around you. Thankfully, you're all far
enough away where there isn't an issue, and the

978
01:12:12,488 --> 01:12:13,750
wall seems to have shattered.

979
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:18,228
FELICIA: That's the way you do it! Thank you. Oh
my gosh, you guys.

980
01:12:18,228 --> 01:12:29,425
LAURA: Before we move forward, I've studied
dragons a lot. I just want to say. So obviously we

981
01:12:29,425 --> 01:12:36,121
all know they're susceptible to fire damage, yes?
This is an ice-breathing bastard. Do as much fire

982
01:12:36,121 --> 01:12:37,319
attacks as we can.

983
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:48,337
MARY: Yes. Don't dragons love, especially white
ones, shiny, sparkly things? Especially gems, from

984
01:12:48,337 --> 01:12:51,011
what I've gleaned over the years.

985
01:12:51,011 --> 01:12:55,006
LAURA: If he could be distracted during combat,
maybe.

986
01:12:55,006 --> 01:13:00,100
FELICIA: A very aggressive person. I got a glimpse
of his attitude, and it is not pleasant.

987
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:01,149
LAURA: Not happy.

988
01:13:01,149 --> 01:13:08,182
FELICIA: No. He is full of bile and vitriol, and
he likes to be worshiped. We could pretend to be

989
01:13:08,182 --> 01:13:09,500
worshiping him.

990
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:13,695
LAURA: But he'll still want to eat us. But yes, we
could do that.

991
01:13:13,695 --> 01:13:15,524
FELICIA: I mean, he didn't eat these two guys!

992
01:13:15,524 --> 01:13:17,834
LAURA: It might be something to think about.

993
01:13:17,834 --> 01:13:20,624
FELICIA: At least to get close to him.

994
01:13:20,624 --> 01:13:23,197
LAURA: Before we spring an attack, yes.

995
01:13:23,197 --> 01:13:25,231
MATT: Go ahead and make an intelligence check.

996
01:13:25,231 --> 01:13:28,066
LAURA: With advantage because it's pertaining to
dragons?

997
01:13:28,066 --> 01:13:32,263
SAM: (laughs) She's a stickler.

998
01:13:32,263 --> 01:13:34,627
LAURA: Is that an insight check?

999
01:13:34,627 --> 01:13:36,815
MATT: That's just adding your intelligence
modifier.

1000
01:13:36,815 --> 01:13:42,375
LAURA: Okay, let me see what that-- oh, that's
Grog's. What am I doing? Okay, so 20 was the first

1001
01:13:42,375 --> 01:13:49,988
roll. 20 is the high roll. Oh, wait! No! 22.

1002
01:13:49,988 --> 01:13:55,545
MATT: 22. Okay. A few things you do know about
dragons, specifically a white dragon, from your

1003
01:13:55,545 --> 01:14:01,539
studying. You lost someone very important to you,
supposedly to a dragon, and so you've spent a lot

1004
01:14:01,539 --> 01:14:08,129
of your life focused on their techniques, their
abilities, how they work. White dragons, you know,

1005
01:14:08,129 --> 01:14:16,163
have complete immunity to cold. Cold damage of all
sorts has no effect on them whatsoever. You know

1006
01:14:16,163 --> 01:14:20,474
that they have capability of flight. They surround
themselves with ice but are not hindered by it

1007
01:14:20,474 --> 01:14:27,147
whatsoever. You do know that their claws and teeth
are extremely dangerous. They themselves also,

1008
01:14:27,147 --> 01:14:34,943
using their wings and tail, become a fierce entity
from all sides. Its cold breath is extremely

1009
01:14:34,943 --> 01:14:41,928
dangerous. It can affect a large area, and even
its presence is frightful enough to where some of

1010
01:14:41,928 --> 01:14:48,041
the most seasoned adventurers go running, fleeing,
or cowering in a corner. Let alone encountering

1011
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:53,110
one in its lair, itself, it already has an
advantage, as it sets an environment to put it at

1012
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:58,371
its advantage. So anything and everything you can
do to prepare and be ready for such an encounter

1013
01:14:58,371 --> 01:15:04,611
would be highly recommended. You do get the
sensation that even though they are cold-based,

1014
01:15:04,611 --> 01:15:14,403
fire doesn't necessarily do any additional damage,
but it is not reduced or able to resist it.

1015
01:15:14,403 --> 01:15:19,886
LAURA: It can't resist fire. What about lightning
damage? Do I know anything about that?

1016
01:15:19,886 --> 01:15:26,313
MATT: Best that you know, most magics and other
types of damage other than cold have an effect on

1017
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:36,207
it, though it does have unnatural resilience to
spells and things for a large part of the combat.

1018
01:15:36,207 --> 01:15:43,397
FELICIA: I can cast Stoneskin on one person. Or up
to, actually-- I could cast Stoneskin

1019
01:15:43,397 --> 01:15:44,848
up to three times.

1020
01:15:44,848 --> 01:15:47,924
MATT: But it's a concentration spell, so you can
only have it up on one person.

1021
01:15:47,924 --> 01:15:53,235
FELICIA: I can only have it on one person at a
time. So who would be most likely to resist

1022
01:15:53,235 --> 01:15:56,624
slashing and bludgeoning and piercing?

1023
01:15:56,624 --> 01:16:01,803
LAURA: Probably Grog. He's going to be the one
that's going to be up close, out of all of us.

1024
01:16:01,803 --> 01:16:06,685
MATT: As Grog says, "That's all right. If I'm
raging, I already have the ability to resist."

1025
01:16:06,685 --> 01:16:09,946
LAURA: That's true. He takes half to piercing and
slashing.

1026
01:16:09,946 --> 01:16:13,411
FELICIA: Oh, okay. So then we need the other
person who might be within range.

1027
01:16:13,411 --> 01:16:16,327
TALIESIN, LAURA, and MARY: Trinket.

1028
01:16:16,327 --> 01:16:17,940
SAM: Trinket's here?

1029
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:20,194
(laughter)

1030
01:16:20,194 --> 01:16:21,970
MATT: As you look over. (sad bear moan)

1031
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:23,325
LAURA: Trinket's right there, Scanlan.

1032
01:16:23,325 --> 01:16:25,214
FELICIA: I don't want to demean him, but his
performance is--

1033
01:16:25,214 --> 01:16:27,965
LAURA: Lyra!

1034
01:16:27,965 --> 01:16:30,528
FELICIA: I love him. Of course he gets the spell.

1035
01:16:30,528 --> 01:16:33,853
LAURA: He is really, really cool!

1036
01:16:33,853 --> 01:16:35,187
SAM: He does things!

1037
01:16:35,187 --> 01:16:36,951
FELICIA: Yes, of course, I don't know what I was
thinking.

1038
01:16:36,951 --> 01:16:41,822
LAURA: Here's the thing. If he doesn't have
Stoneskin, I probably won't let him charge.

1039
01:16:41,822 --> 01:16:45,118
TALIESIN: But if he does have Stoneskin, will you
let him charge?

1040
01:16:45,118 --> 01:16:46,315
LAURA: Probably.

1041
01:16:46,315 --> 01:16:52,543
FELICIA: All right, well, that could be another--
Does that seem like a good idea for a bear?

1042
01:16:52,543 --> 01:16:59,873
MARY: Scanlan, are most of your attacks up close
or are they far?

1043
01:16:59,873 --> 01:17:05,503
SAM: I've got a wide range. I like to keep people
guessing. It's my thing.

1044
01:17:05,503 --> 01:17:08,684
FELICIA: But we wouldn't really want you within
claw damage.

1045
01:17:08,684 --> 01:17:10,956
SAM: I wouldn't want that, either.

1046
01:17:10,956 --> 01:17:19,149
FELICIA: It does make more-- I don't mean to
demean Trinket, he is a lovely bear.

1047
01:17:19,149 --> 01:17:23,341
SAM: Of all the bears I've known, he's top five.
Top five.

1048
01:17:23,341 --> 01:17:28,481
MATT: As you're saying this, Trinket senses the
conversation and plants both feet in the ground

1049
01:17:28,481 --> 01:17:29,880
(growls).

1050
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,453
LAURA: See how tough he is?

1051
01:17:32,453 --> 01:17:36,979
MATT: He seems to be showing off. And for a
moment, even though it's a conversation, that's a

1052
01:17:36,979 --> 01:17:38,343
dangerous-looking bear.

1053
01:17:38,343 --> 01:17:45,256
MARY: I use Beast Speak on Trinket. And say,
Trinket, what are you feeling right now? What's

1054
01:17:45,256 --> 01:17:47,149
going on? You seem very excited.

1055
01:17:47,149 --> 01:17:53,501
MATT: Okay, you notice Zahra leans forward and
starts giving this series of low, guttural sounds.

1056
01:17:53,501 --> 01:17:57,978
It's weird. There's this weird arcane interference
and this strange, almost like the sound itself is

1057
01:17:57,978 --> 01:18:02,837
being muffled and stretched. And Trinket turns to
her and starts giving the same noises back.

1058
01:18:02,837 --> 01:18:10,544
Trinket says to you, essentially, "I'll do
whatever it takes to protect my Vex. If this

1059
01:18:10,544 --> 01:18:13,534
"creature tries anything, I will tear its throat
from its head."

1060
01:18:13,534 --> 01:18:15,840
FELICIA: He's a sexier bear than I thought he
was.

1061
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:20,834
LAURA: And he gives good massages, Lyra.

1062
01:18:20,834 --> 01:18:29,249
FELICIA: Okay. So I will cast Stoneskin. It lasts
an hour, so I'll cast it within the perimeter that

1063
01:18:29,249 --> 01:18:30,642
we think we're going to get hit.

1064
01:18:30,642 --> 01:18:32,579
LAURA: Tell him that I love him very much!

1065
01:18:32,579 --> 01:18:35,833
MARY: I also want to tell you, Trinket. First of
all, boy or girl? Just have to check.

1066
01:18:35,833 --> 01:18:38,174
LAURA: He's a boy! Look at his giant dick.

1067
01:18:38,174 --> 01:18:40,619
MATT: He leans back in a sitting bear position.

1068
01:18:40,619 --> 01:18:51,615
MARY: Thank you, I needed some inspiration for
this fight we're about to do. All right. I also

1069
01:18:51,615 --> 01:18:56,535
want you to know that Vex loves you very much and
will do whatever she can to protect you.

1070
01:18:56,535 --> 01:19:05,433
MATT: As this guttural conversation comes forth,
Trinket comes up to you and nuzzles his nose up

1071
01:19:05,433 --> 01:19:06,716
against your side.

1072
01:19:06,716 --> 01:19:08,034
LAURA: Oh, little buddy!

1073
01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:10,615
FELICIA: I wish Aldor would do that to me.

1074
01:19:10,615 --> 01:19:13,687
SAM and MARY: Show his giant cock to you?

1075
01:19:13,687 --> 01:19:17,151
(laughter)

1076
01:19:17,151 --> 01:19:19,188
FELICIA: I saw it once. It was glorious.

1077
01:19:19,188 --> 01:19:24,582
MARY: Very inspiring.

1078
01:19:24,582 --> 01:19:32,217
MATT: As Lyra's in this memory trance, finishes
casting Stoneskin and reaches out and touches

1079
01:19:32,217 --> 01:19:40,099
Trinket. You can see Trinket's physical form, all
the fur seems to coalesce into a thick rock-type

1080
01:19:40,099 --> 01:19:42,819
exterior shell of magical protection.

1081
01:19:42,819 --> 01:19:44,598
LAURA: What does his armor class raise by?

1082
01:19:44,598 --> 01:19:50,279
MATT: Armor class doesn't change, but all damage
that Trinket takes from bludgeoning, piercing, or

1083
01:19:50,279 --> 01:19:51,994
slashing is reduced by half.

1084
01:19:51,994 --> 01:19:53,090
LAURA: Nice.

1085
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:57,083
MARY: Thank you, Trinket, lovely to talk to you.

1086
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:58,615
SAM: What else can we do to prepare?

1087
01:19:58,615 --> 01:20:01,997
LAURA: I promise, Lyra, I will let him attack this
battle.

1088
01:20:01,997 --> 01:20:07,017
FELICIA: Oh good, no, it's fantastic. That invited
so many good thoughts in my mind. I don't mind

1089
01:20:07,017 --> 01:20:09,848
anything at this point. I mean, what?

1090
01:20:09,848 --> 01:20:15,390
MATT: The giants begin to move forward into the
cavern.

1091
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:16,906
LAURA: It's happening.

1092
01:20:16,906 --> 01:20:21,228
MARY: Yep. Screw your courage to the
sticking-place.

1093
01:20:21,228 --> 01:20:24,528
TALIESIN: Ew. Oh. All right.

1094
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:30,106
MATT: All right. Scanlan, I want you to go ahead
and roll a dexterity saving throw.

1095
01:20:30,106 --> 01:20:39,070
SAM: Oh boy, already? Dex. 17. Oh. Plus four. 21.

1096
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:44,789
MATT: 21. As you begin stepping forward up the
cavern where the wall itself has collapsed, you

1097
01:20:44,789 --> 01:20:50,489
step forward onto a part of the ice that is far
more brittle than you expected, and suddenly it

1098
01:20:50,489 --> 01:20:52,106
(cracks) breaks beneath your foot.

1099
01:20:52,106 --> 01:20:53,989
SAM: My Scanlan-sense is tingling!

1100
01:20:53,989 --> 01:20:57,370
MATT: You push off and fall onto your back, and as
you guys look over, you hear the cracking and the

1101
01:20:57,370 --> 01:21:01,815
falling of some sort of stone or ice-like
structure. You see where Scanlan was stepping a

1102
01:21:01,815 --> 01:21:10,509
ten-foot-diameter pit crumbles and falls beneath.
And peering over the inside and using your light,

1103
01:21:10,509 --> 01:21:15,497
you can see there appears to be an arrangement of
razor-sharp ice spikes gathered at the bottom of a

1104
01:21:15,497 --> 01:21:16,555
15-foot pit.

1105
01:21:16,555 --> 01:21:22,431
LAURA: What? Why isn't my brother here? I need to
check for traps from now on. Snoop ahead.

1106
01:21:22,431 --> 01:21:26,978
TALIESIN: I think we've found one. There's a trap
right there.

1107
01:21:26,978 --> 01:21:29,850
SAM: Does that take up our whole path now?

1108
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:35,568
MATT: The tunnel itself is about 20 feet wide at
this point, so you guys can move around it. The

1109
01:21:35,568 --> 01:21:37,942
giants were ahead of you at this point.

1110
01:21:37,942 --> 01:21:39,387
SAM: Did they laugh?

1111
01:21:39,387 --> 01:21:43,043
MATT: One of them shakes his head and the other
one just keeps walking.

1112
01:21:43,043 --> 01:21:48,324
FELICIA: Gee, I had a spell that would be useful,
but it's not ready.

1113
01:21:48,324 --> 01:21:51,873
SAM: Thanks for that update.

1114
01:21:51,873 --> 01:22:01,930
FELICIA: I'm just being honest. I could've lied,
said that I totally prepared that spell, but I

1115
01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:04,653
could've been knowing Giant the whole time, so I
just.

1116
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:07,103
LAURA: (laughs) Oops.

1117
01:22:07,103 --> 01:22:12,897
FELICIA: If anybody falls, I can make them fall
gently. That's on the list.

1118
01:22:12,897 --> 01:22:20,136
LAURA: Oh, that's good. Is that Feather Fall?
Nice. Okay, I perceive some more and see if I see

1119
01:22:20,136 --> 01:22:22,086
any traps ahead of us the whole time.

1120
01:22:22,086 --> 01:22:26,320
MATT: All right. You go ahead and make a
perception check as you move forward.

1121
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:40,246
LAURA: That would be a seven. 15.

1122
01:22:40,246 --> 01:22:51,160
MATT: 15, okay. You guys continue to push upwards
this long spiraling corridor. You reach another

1123
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:58,582
ice wall that has already been partially broken
from some sort of encounter long ago. You

1124
01:22:58,582 --> 01:23:02,820
immediately see that the part of the wall that is
broken. There's about a ten-foot-wide blocked

1125
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:08,465
passage, the entirety of that walkway appears to
be another trap, and the giants are waiting back.

1126
01:23:08,465 --> 01:23:14,452
LAURA: Good for you. There's a thing here. We
should not step on it.

1127
01:23:14,452 --> 01:23:18,339
I have one job on this ship!

1128
01:23:18,339 --> 01:23:21,515
MARY: I know it's stupid, but goddamn it, I'm
going to do it.

1129
01:23:21,515 --> 01:23:23,816
SAM: How do we get around? What do we do?

1130
01:23:23,816 --> 01:23:28,535
LAURA: We should maybe break down this ice wall
and then not walk on this area. How about that?

1131
01:23:28,535 --> 01:23:30,368
SAM: Oh. Okay. Let's, yes.

1132
01:23:30,368 --> 01:23:33,460
FELICIA: Oh, good. Should I Firebolt? I mean, I'm
going to Firebolt. From a distance.

1133
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:37,754
LAURA, FELICIA, MARY, and SAM: (singing) From a
distance, the world is...

1134
01:23:37,754 --> 01:23:41,583
SAM: Beaches.

1135
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:44,794
FELICIA: That's a 30.

1136
01:23:44,794 --> 01:23:46,870
MATT: 30. Go ahead and roll some damage.

1137
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:50,087
FELICIA: Yeah! Nine and eight and a ten, these are
good rolls. That's a 27.

1138
01:23:50,087 --> 01:23:57,157
MATT: 27. This bolt arcs around from the side. You
hit it right at the point where half of the wall

1139
01:23:57,157 --> 01:24:00,868
had collapsed, causing the other half of the wall
to immediately shatter and collapse inward,

1140
01:24:00,868 --> 01:24:06,696
spraying bits of ice and rock against the wall on
that side. The ground becomes rough terrain in

1141
01:24:06,696 --> 01:24:11,990
that general vicinity, but it's easy enough to
traverse over without any serious issue. As you

1142
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:16,035
guys step over, and the giants make their way
across, stepping over it entirely with their long

1143
01:24:16,035 --> 01:24:24,561
gait. You move carefully over the shattered wall
bits, but the ground itself seems solid. You get

1144
01:24:24,561 --> 01:24:26,709
past without issue.

1145
01:24:26,709 --> 01:24:31,063
LAURA: Before we go into the actual lair of the
dragon-- once we get to it; I don't know much more

1146
01:24:31,063 --> 01:24:40,499
of these thingies there are. Do we want to go in
as if we're offering it something and saying, hey,

1147
01:24:40,499 --> 01:24:44,411
we love you, we want to bring you people, and
stuff like that?

1148
01:24:44,411 --> 01:24:46,113
MARY: We are here to serve you?

1149
01:24:46,113 --> 01:24:52,739
LAURA: Or do we want to send somebody in first and
act like they're here to serve it, and then we all

1150
01:24:52,739 --> 01:24:55,497
spring in and surprise it? What do you want to
do?

1151
01:24:55,497 --> 01:24:57,524
SAM: They like to eat giants.

1152
01:24:57,524 --> 01:25:03,255
LAURA: It wants to eat anything frozen, basically.
It freezes things, and then it eats them.

1153
01:25:03,255 --> 01:25:07,122
FELICIA: Well, there was another party that the
guild-- the guild did send another party.

1154
01:25:07,122 --> 01:25:10,410
LAURA: I don't know if they had a method or if
they just walked right in.

1155
01:25:10,410 --> 01:25:15,481
TALIESIN: Perhaps if we're quiet and stealthy. Can
we be quiet and stealthy?

1156
01:25:15,481 --> 01:25:16,554
FELICIA: I can't!

1157
01:25:16,554 --> 01:25:19,542
MARY: I can cast Invisibility.

1158
01:25:19,542 --> 01:25:22,206
FELICIA: Ooh, I can cast Invisibility on myself.

1159
01:25:22,206 --> 01:25:23,601
SAM: That would help.

1160
01:25:23,601 --> 01:25:30,117
MARY: So learning of the dragon, will it be able
to detect us if we cast Invisibility?

1161
01:25:30,117 --> 01:25:36,688
FELICIA: That's nature? That would be a nature
check or animal handling?

1162
01:25:36,688 --> 01:25:39,896
MATT: This would be an intelligence check.

1163
01:25:39,896 --> 01:25:45,782
FELICIA: Oh. Well, I can do that. That's a 30--
that's a 23.

1164
01:25:45,782 --> 01:25:54,257
MATT: Okay, so what you've read of dragons, their
ability to sense their surroundings is adapted to

1165
01:25:54,257 --> 01:25:58,475
all environments, whether they can see or not.
They actually have the ability to see with no

1166
01:25:58,475 --> 01:26:05,832
sight necessary to a certain extent, so
invisibility would help at a distance, quite a bit

1167
01:26:05,832 --> 01:26:11,384
of distance, but within a certain point it is able
to sense your presence whether or not it can see

1168
01:26:11,384 --> 01:26:16,183
you. Also note, if you cast Invisibility you lose
your concentration spell on Trinket.

1169
01:26:16,183 --> 01:26:20,430
FELICIA: Oh, so let's not do that. Now, his vanity,
he does like being worshipped.

1170
01:26:20,430 --> 01:26:22,033
So that is the key.

1171
01:26:22,033 --> 01:26:23,908
SAM: So we could go in with an offering.

1172
01:26:23,908 --> 01:26:29,675
LAURA: An offering. What if we laid a trap in the
offering? What if we used your frag grenade that

1173
01:26:29,675 --> 01:26:33,592
you did. Is it a bomb? Does it set off on a timer?
Is it very fragile?

1174
01:26:33,592 --> 01:26:41,276
TALIESIN: I have to set it off personally. I
actually have to shoot it to set it off.

1175
01:26:41,276 --> 01:26:45,711
MARY: So smile, you son of a bitch, basically, if
we put it in his mouth?

1176
01:26:45,711 --> 01:26:53,070
LAURA: Do we have any bombs or anything like that?
Because I have a very big beautiful diamond of

1177
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:59,257
awesomeness that we uncovered before that I keep
about. We could present him with this big,

1178
01:26:59,257 --> 01:27:03,241
huge-ass diamond and then have it trapped with
some sort of exploding device.

1179
01:27:03,241 --> 01:27:04,641
SAM: We could.

1180
01:27:04,641 --> 01:27:07,255
FELICIA: If he picks the diamond up off of the--

1181
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:13,782
LAURA: We could put it in a bag and then put the
diamond on top of a bomb or something, and then

1182
01:27:13,782 --> 01:27:16,180
when he picks it up and like, (explosion) in his
face.

1183
01:27:16,180 --> 01:27:22,834
TALIESIN: That's hoping for an awful lot of things
to go our way. More things than normally go our

1184
01:27:22,834 --> 01:27:24,287
way, to be fair.

1185
01:27:24,287 --> 01:27:32,799
FELICIA: Well, it seems worthy of trying to get
close to him, because his attacks-- Would he as a

1186
01:27:32,799 --> 01:27:35,197
dragon have a very good length attack?

1187
01:27:35,197 --> 01:27:43,965
MATT: Yeah, as a dragon has some decent reach with
some of its attacks. Its bite, and its length of

1188
01:27:43,965 --> 01:27:48,524
neck and ability to bite actually has quite a bit
of reach. Also, its tail has quite some reach, as

1189
01:27:48,524 --> 01:27:51,709
well. It can cover some decent ground just with
its physical form.

1190
01:27:51,709 --> 01:27:55,008
FELICIA: The thing is, obviously the trolls don't
come up here a lot or there wouldn't be so much

1191
01:27:55,008 --> 01:28:01,095
ice in here. Walls. So I think that's a problem,
so it's not as if they come up here all the time

1192
01:28:01,095 --> 01:28:02,952
to give it treats. Right?

1193
01:28:02,952 --> 01:28:09,188
SAM: We could just walk in there. I could be
holding Lyra as my captive and say, I've brought

1194
01:28:09,188 --> 01:28:10,639
you this captive to eat.

1195
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:12,272
FELICIA: I don't like that one.

1196
01:28:12,272 --> 01:28:14,055
SAM: Well, you know, you're very appealing.

1197
01:28:14,055 --> 01:28:19,501
MARY: We still don't know that the giants aren't
going to help us.

1198
01:28:19,501 --> 01:28:22,838
MATT: As you guys are stepping forward up the
pathway, you turn a corner and you can see the

1199
01:28:22,838 --> 01:28:28,363
giants have stopped, and they have a physical
trepidation to the way that they're leaning

1200
01:28:28,363 --> 01:28:34,679
backward in their stance. As you turn the corner,
the little bit of light that reaches out, you can

1201
01:28:34,679 --> 01:28:39,613
see there appears to be one final ice wall that
has a ten-foot opening where it's left as a

1202
01:28:39,613 --> 01:28:42,377
pathway, and it opens into a darkened chamber.

1203
01:28:42,377 --> 01:28:55,622
MARY: Well, I have darkvision for 60 feet, so I
could approach around the side and peer in and just

1204
01:28:55,622 --> 01:28:58,612
see what's there, 60 feet ahead.

1205
01:28:58,612 --> 01:29:06,143
MATT: Okay, so you walk up past the giants to this
entrance? All right. As you walk forward, you see

1206
01:29:06,143 --> 01:29:10,401
your vision spill out in the darkness, with a
little bit of dim light and the darkness before

1207
01:29:10,401 --> 01:29:16,347
you reveals itself. You can see a smattering of
broken bits along the ground, looks like rocks and

1208
01:29:16,347 --> 01:29:26,125
ice, a frozen leg of some humanoid, an arm, some
scattered, broken armor and weapons. There are

1209
01:29:26,125 --> 01:29:33,475
pieces of what appears to be a frozen-over
graveyard of previous attempts towards inhabiting

1210
01:29:33,475 --> 01:29:38,977
this room. And as you continue to push forward
towards the edge, just towards the perimeter as

1211
01:29:38,977 --> 01:29:45,186
far as your vision can see at this doorway, you
see a central platform in the middle of this giant

1212
01:29:45,186 --> 01:29:51,688
chamber that rises up about 15 feet. Ten, 15 feet,
and just cresting over the top of this platform is

1213
01:29:51,688 --> 01:30:02,997
the edge of an alabaster snout, with teeth
overlapping. You hear this (snarls) growling

1214
01:30:02,997 --> 01:30:12,391
snarl. And this little voice spills out from
underneath and says, "Why don't you enter? If

1215
01:30:12,391 --> 01:30:20,444
"you're going to arrive and present yourselves, do
not cower yet."

1216
01:30:20,444 --> 01:30:23,551
FELICIA: Get that diamond out!

1217
01:30:23,551 --> 01:30:25,798
MATT: And with that, we're going to go ahead and
take a break.

1218
01:30:25,798 --> 01:30:27,715
(shouting)

1219
01:30:27,715 --> 01:30:32,395
MATT: We're going to take a quick ten-minute break
to go ahead and use the bathroom, get a little

1220
01:30:32,395 --> 01:30:34,139
snack. Yes?

1221
01:30:34,139 --> 01:30:36,539
ZAC: We're eight subscribers away from another
giveaway.

1222
01:30:36,539 --> 01:30:39,231
(cheering)

1223
01:30:39,231 --> 01:30:43,608
ZAC: The giveaway includes a signed player's
handbook by all your wonderful hosts, as well as

1224
01:30:43,608 --> 01:30:48,290
the hosts that will be here next week, and a
signed copy of Felicia Day's new book.

1225
01:30:48,290 --> 01:30:52,026
FELICIA: My new book! It's right there! I signed
it.

1226
01:30:52,026 --> 01:30:53,397
SAM: What's it called? What's the title?

1227
01:30:53,397 --> 01:30:55,185
FELICIA: It's called You're Never Weird on the
Internet (Almost).

1228
01:30:55,185 --> 01:30:57,355
SAM: Aw. That's cool.

1229
01:30:57,355 --> 01:30:58,609
FELICIA: It's amusing.

1230
01:30:58,609 --> 01:31:00,492
ZAC: Are you weird in real life all the time?

1231
01:31:00,492 --> 01:31:02,094
FELICIA: No, I mean, look at me.

1232
01:31:02,094 --> 01:31:04,638
ZAC: No. Definitely not.

1233
01:31:04,638 --> 01:31:05,935
FELICIA: I don't believe your face.

1234
01:31:05,935 --> 01:31:09,693
SAM: Did you consider the title Day Dreaming?

1235
01:31:09,693 --> 01:31:11,341
FELICIA: You're pretty.

1236
01:31:11,341 --> 01:31:13,912
SAM: I just thought, because it's like a pun.

1237
01:31:13,912 --> 01:31:15,922
FELICIA: No, that's awful.

1238
01:31:15,922 --> 01:31:17,672
SAM: Consider it.

1239
01:31:17,672 --> 01:31:22,560
MATT: Somewhere, someone's holding their
manuscript entitled Day Dreaming and going

1240
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,081
(fake crying).

1241
01:31:24,081 --> 01:31:25,595
(laughter)

1242
01:31:25,595 --> 01:31:29,254
MATT: All right, guys, we'll take a quick break,
we'll see you back in ten minutes or so to see how

1243
01:31:29,254 --> 01:31:30,650
this goes.

1244
01:31:30,650 --> 01:46:19,098
[break]

1245
01:46:19,098 --> 01:46:22,168
MATT: Welcome back from the break! Our fantastic
Travis finally made it.

1246
01:46:22,168 --> 01:46:24,773
(cheering)

1247
01:46:24,773 --> 01:46:27,506
TRAVIS: I heard I rolled really well in the
beginning of this.

1248
01:46:27,506 --> 01:46:29,243
MATT: Yeah, it went wonderfully.

1249
01:46:29,243 --> 01:46:34,165
LAURA: Sorry. But your Chain of Returning is
attached to your blazing warhammer now.

1250
01:46:34,165 --> 01:46:39,793
MATT: There you go. So as it ends up, we have a
new winner. KadenPhilly is the winner,

1251
01:46:39,793 --> 01:46:44,919
congratulations, of our next giveaway. So we'll be
giving away the player's handbook, the signed

1252
01:46:44,919 --> 01:46:49,807
photo, a copy of Felicia's book-- yay!-- and a
bunch of other goodies coming your way soon, so

1253
01:46:49,807 --> 01:46:54,987
make sure you get your information to the
Overlord. We'll have another giveaway at 5,800, if

1254
01:46:54,987 --> 01:46:58,949
we can get to there by the end of the show
tonight, so let's see if we can hit that. In the

1255
01:46:58,949 --> 01:47:00,448
meantime, guys--

1256
01:47:00,448 --> 01:47:02,948
TRAVIS: Shit.

1257
01:47:02,948 --> 01:47:05,525
MARY: Yeah. Welcome to the shit.

1258
01:47:05,525 --> 01:47:07,766
TRAVIS: I've been watching in the car.

1259
01:47:07,766 --> 01:47:11,358
MATT: You guys have all been making your way
through the cavern back here. Zahra has stepped

1260
01:47:11,358 --> 01:47:17,257
forward and in the darkness, you can see right
here at the edge a form.

1261
01:47:17,257 --> 01:47:19,948
FELICIA: He's up above us, though.

1262
01:47:19,948 --> 01:47:24,228
MATT: Yep. About ten, 15 feet up on this platform,
leaning over the edge is Rimefang, staring at you

1263
01:47:24,228 --> 01:47:27,850
through the darkness. A claw comes forward and
beckons.

1264
01:47:27,850 --> 01:47:33,183
LAURA: Can I, from here, before we go in there--
I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on him.

1265
01:47:33,183 --> 01:47:34,521
MATT: You can't see him right now.

1266
01:47:34,521 --> 01:47:35,865
MARY: I can.

1267
01:47:35,865 --> 01:47:36,985
MATT: Zahra can.

1268
01:47:36,985 --> 01:47:39,758
TRAVIS: I can, too. I've got my belt of dwarven
darkvision.

1269
01:47:39,758 --> 01:47:41,525
FELICIA: Is he speaking dragon?

1270
01:47:41,525 --> 01:47:42,764
MATT: Speaking Common.

1271
01:47:42,764 --> 01:47:44,178
FELICIA: He's speaking Common. Okay.

1272
01:47:44,178 --> 01:47:51,022
MARY: Would he detect if I would cast anything on
him at the moment? I don't know! Then I'm going to

1273
01:47:51,022 --> 01:47:53,227
sit here and drink my drink.

1274
01:47:53,227 --> 01:47:56,433
TRAVIS: Are you offering him that jewel, or did we
ditch that idea?

1275
01:47:56,433 --> 01:47:58,053
LAURA: No, are we doing that?

1276
01:47:58,053 --> 01:48:02,512
SAM: We might. Depends what he asks. Yeah, let's
do it.

1277
01:48:02,512 --> 01:48:04,389
TRAVIS: Yeah, roll it out like a tennis ball for a
dog.

1278
01:48:04,389 --> 01:48:08,605
TALIESIN: Do we have a little bag we can put the
jewels in?

1279
01:48:08,605 --> 01:48:09,894
LAURA: Yeah.

1280
01:48:09,894 --> 01:48:12,824
SAM: We don't have time to do any of this stuff.

1281
01:48:12,824 --> 01:48:14,183
LAURA: Yeah, we do.

1282
01:48:14,183 --> 01:48:18,922
TALIESIN: We have a second. I'm going to hand you
my Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch. Why not?

1283
01:48:18,922 --> 01:48:20,711
TRAVIS: You can Hold Monster?

1284
01:48:20,711 --> 01:48:22,909
MARY: I can Hold Monster. Yeah, we both can.

1285
01:48:22,909 --> 01:48:24,453
TRAVIS: Does he qualify as a monster?

1286
01:48:24,453 --> 01:48:27,549
MATT: As far as you know, dragon's pretty much a
monster.

1287
01:48:27,549 --> 01:48:39,786
LAURA: I am putting Percy's hand grenade inside
this bag along with a diamond. Oh, it's a really

1288
01:48:39,786 --> 01:48:40,960
pretty diamond.

1289
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:42,689
TALIESIN: We'll get it back, it's okay.

1290
01:48:42,689 --> 01:48:44,009
LAURA: As long as it doesn't explode.

1291
01:48:44,009 --> 01:48:47,609
TALIESIN: You can't explode a diamond.

1292
01:48:47,609 --> 01:48:49,260
LAURA: That's true, diamonds are really strong.

1293
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:50,944
TALIESIN: Diamonds are forever.

1294
01:48:50,944 --> 01:48:55,196
LAURA: I put that in the bag. Are we tossing this
at him? What are we doing?

1295
01:48:55,196 --> 01:48:58,649
SAM: No! We walk in. He's beckoning us. Let's walk
in. I'm walking in.

1296
01:48:58,649 --> 01:49:01,081
MATT: All right, so you guys all walk in?

1297
01:49:01,081 --> 01:49:04,584
SAM: I'm going ahead.

1298
01:49:04,584 --> 01:49:06,547
LAURA: Here, hold the bag.

1299
01:49:06,547 --> 01:49:07,651
SAM: I'll take the bag.

1300
01:49:07,651 --> 01:49:09,557
MATT: Zahra, are you staying ahead with Scanlan?

1301
01:49:09,557 --> 01:49:13,212
FELICIA: I believe that you squishy people should
be back here!

1302
01:49:13,212 --> 01:49:15,328
TRAVIS: I'm not squishy, I go with them.

1303
01:49:15,328 --> 01:49:22,018
MATT: As a note, as you guys are walking through
and the light hits the walls, you begin to see the

1304
01:49:22,018 --> 01:49:27,375
ice itself, which you've become accustomed to, is
now being broken up into what looks like little

1305
01:49:27,375 --> 01:49:34,202
glittering stars. It's almost like you're walking
through a frozen area of the night sky. You

1306
01:49:34,202 --> 01:49:39,685
realize that there are gold pieces frozen in
sporadically all throughout the wall, the floor,

1307
01:49:39,685 --> 01:49:45,922
the ceiling here. The actual, whatever wealth this
dragon has acquired is in some way shape or form

1308
01:49:45,922 --> 01:49:54,510
embedded in its own lair. Anyway. So we have the
three of you up front. Who's up next? I imagine

1309
01:49:54,510 --> 01:49:55,578
we've got Trinket.

1310
01:49:55,578 --> 01:49:56,871
LAURA: Yeah. Me.

1311
01:49:56,871 --> 01:49:58,923
MATT: All right, so you guys all continue to move
forward?

1312
01:49:58,923 --> 01:50:01,169
MARY: Not too close!

1313
01:50:01,169 --> 01:50:02,359
LAURA: Scanlan!

1314
01:50:02,359 --> 01:50:05,662
MATT: There? Where do you want to stop? You guys
have laser pointers to use, by the way, if you

1315
01:50:05,662 --> 01:50:07,100
want to point out wherever you want to be.

1316
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:10,229
LAURA: Scanlan should definitely talk to him.

1317
01:50:10,229 --> 01:50:12,233
TALIESIN: I would like to go around here.

1318
01:50:12,233 --> 01:50:21,456
FELICIA: Oh glorious Rimefang, we have an offering
for you!

1319
01:50:21,456 --> 01:50:22,624
TALIESIN: That's not me.

1320
01:50:22,624 --> 01:50:23,927
SAM: Is that you? Hello.

1321
01:50:23,927 --> 01:50:26,772
MATT: No, that was you, sorry. So Percy goes
here.

1322
01:50:26,772 --> 01:50:30,817
LAURA: Over by Percy. But further.

1323
01:50:30,817 --> 01:50:34,129
FELICIA: Is that 90 feet?

1324
01:50:34,129 --> 01:50:37,386
SAM: It's less than that. We're 30 feet away now.

1325
01:50:37,386 --> 01:50:41,530
LAURA: Oh, come on, giants. Help us out.

1326
01:50:41,530 --> 01:50:51,191
MATT: So as you guys enter the chamber, the actual
air here is more still and cold than at any point

1327
01:50:51,191 --> 01:50:58,819
of the interior of the cavern has been. Even
breathing inward hurts in itself as the freezing

1328
01:50:58,819 --> 01:51:05,292
air hits your lungs. Rimefang sits there, perched
on top of this central platform, grinning down

1329
01:51:05,292 --> 01:51:11,787
towards the rest of the group. You, who have
shouted this out, Lyra, about having an offering.

1330
01:51:11,787 --> 01:51:16,655
Rimefang immediately leans forward. "An offering,
you say?"

1331
01:51:16,655 --> 01:51:22,529
LAURA: I want to make my way further up. While
he's talking, I want to make my way along the wall

1332
01:51:22,529 --> 01:51:23,400
a little.

1333
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:27,002
MATT: Make a stealth check.

1334
01:51:27,002 --> 01:51:33,503
LAURA: Oh no. 20! Natural 20! And all I needed was
fried chicken!

1335
01:51:33,503 --> 01:51:36,929
(laughter)

1336
01:51:36,929 --> 01:51:38,535
TRAVIS: It's true.

1337
01:51:38,535 --> 01:51:45,855
MATT: All right, so. You, somehow, manage to dart
out of the visual reference of a very focused

1338
01:51:45,855 --> 01:51:52,437
adult white dragon. Rimefang does not seem to
gather any movement, and you vanish into the side.

1339
01:51:52,437 --> 01:51:54,030
Where do you want to go?

1340
01:51:54,030 --> 01:51:58,099
LAURA: A little bit further. There. That sounds
good.

1341
01:51:58,099 --> 01:52:02,072
MATT: Okay. Percy, as you're stepping over you
realize you're stepping onto what looks like the

1342
01:52:02,072 --> 01:52:07,592
broken lower half of another giant that has fallen
over, a booted leg and part of an eaten armored

1343
01:52:07,592 --> 01:52:15,496
torso to your back. As you begin to look through,
you also see there currently frozen in place three

1344
01:52:15,496 --> 01:52:19,790
other individuals that are in mid-battle and are
frozen solid.

1345
01:52:19,790 --> 01:52:23,755
LAURA: If we unfreeze them, they could help us.

1346
01:52:23,755 --> 01:52:26,232
FELICIA: They're probably dead in there.

1347
01:52:26,232 --> 01:52:28,617
TRAVIS: We're standing in front of a dragon!

1348
01:52:28,617 --> 01:52:30,403
SAM: Rimefang?

1349
01:52:30,403 --> 01:52:37,392
MARY: Oh great Rimefang! What a glorious moon you
are amidst the stars of your treasure.

1350
01:52:37,392 --> 01:52:39,115
TRAVIS: Oh, pour it on, why don't you?

1351
01:52:39,115 --> 01:52:41,392
(laughter)

1352
01:52:41,392 --> 01:52:43,480
MARY: We do have an offering for you.

1353
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:50,211
SAM: Yes. And I use Mage Hand to lift the diamond
out of the bag and dangle it in front of the

1354
01:52:50,211 --> 01:52:55,817
dragon. We've brought you this diamond. We've come
from the Slayer's Take. We represent the guild and

1355
01:52:55,817 --> 01:53:01,672
we are here to formally apologize for sending a
few of our members here in the past and promise

1356
01:53:01,672 --> 01:53:08,952
that we never shall again, and as a gift of
apology and hopefully brotherhood, we offer you

1357
01:53:08,952 --> 01:53:11,370
this diamond. There are many more to come.

1358
01:53:11,370 --> 01:53:12,940
TALIESIN: And everything else in the bag, as
well.

1359
01:53:12,940 --> 01:53:16,220
LAURA: And then you put it back in the bag. And
then you give it to him.

1360
01:53:16,220 --> 01:53:26,902
MATT: There's this low, guttural snarl (snarls).
It leans forward, sneaking down off the perch a

1361
01:53:26,902 --> 01:53:32,288
little bit. Its head moves forward and stretches
outward, no more than maybe ten feet from your

1362
01:53:32,288 --> 01:53:38,583
face. You can see it inspecting the diamond as
you're holding it by the Mage Hand, floating above

1363
01:53:38,583 --> 01:53:50,946
the rest of the bag. Chuckles to itself.
(chuckles) "This is your measly offering?"

1364
01:53:50,946 --> 01:53:56,870
SAM: There is a diamond of much greater size and
value in this pouch. But first, we want to hear

1365
01:53:56,870 --> 01:54:02,272
that you are going to allow us safe passage out of
here before we turn it over to you.

1366
01:54:02,272 --> 01:54:04,801
MATT: Persuasion check.

1367
01:54:04,801 --> 01:54:09,545
ZAC: Guys, just so you know, the stream's
buffering, so hold. Twitch problems.

1368
01:54:09,545 --> 01:54:11,463
FELICIA: Oh no.

1369
01:54:11,463 --> 01:54:13,271
ZAC: Hold for buffer.

1370
01:54:13,271 --> 01:54:15,943
MATT: Do we know at what point it started
buffering?

1371
01:54:15,943 --> 01:54:19,268
ZAC: You're back up. Missing the last two
sentences. Buffer over.

1372
01:54:19,268 --> 01:54:28,841
SAM: Please allow us safe passage. And then you
said roll for persuasion, and I rolled a 19.

1373
01:54:28,841 --> 01:54:41,318
MATT: Rimefang's head withdraws back and its claws
pull back on top of the platform. It lifts its

1374
01:54:41,318 --> 01:54:50,813
head up, looking down at you with this very
disinterested, snooty look (huffs). As it snorts

1375
01:54:50,813 --> 01:54:57,246
out of its nose, this puff of frost shoots out and
crystals of ice fall and clatter to the ground

1376
01:54:57,246 --> 01:54:58,481
around it.

1377
01:54:58,481 --> 01:55:00,207
SAM: That was so cool.

1378
01:55:00,207 --> 01:55:11,536
MATT: "You. You trespass into my domain, your
voices bickering and bouncing off the walls,

1379
01:55:11,536 --> 01:55:26,203
"annoying me, waking me from my slumber. My freshly
eaten slumber. I am curious, before you so walk

1380
01:55:26,298 --> 01:55:39,087
"into my dinner table, why you seem to have gotten
past my guardians?" At which point the two giants

1381
01:55:39,087 --> 01:55:44,550
who are standing behind you look over at each
other nervously.

1382
01:55:44,550 --> 01:55:50,252
SAM: Your guardians are well aware of our power
and position and did not want to offend you by

1383
01:55:50,252 --> 01:55:51,736
turning us away.

1384
01:55:51,736 --> 01:56:08,036
MATT: "Are you to tell me I spared your
insignificant lives so you could let this

1385
01:56:08,036 --> 01:56:15,035
"insulting, insufferable insect into the heart of
my domain?"

1386
01:56:15,035 --> 01:56:22,229
SAM: I'm called Burt Reynolds, and I take great
offense at that.

1387
01:56:22,229 --> 01:56:28,478
MATT: The dragon's head turns to the side for a
moment as a glance of confusion and almost

1388
01:56:28,478 --> 01:56:38,883
amusement that you speak up to it with such a
disrespectful manner. (evil laughter)

1389
01:56:38,883 --> 01:56:42,671
SAM: You can call me Mr. Reynolds or simply Burt.

1390
01:56:42,671 --> 01:56:52,666
MATT: (heavy impacts) Its claws dig in and tighten
on the edges of this platform. You can see the

1391
01:56:52,666 --> 01:56:58,016
stonework and the ice crack and shatter under its
grip as pieces of stone tumble down the edges of

1392
01:56:58,016 --> 01:57:04,162
the platform, scattering across the ground with a
slight clattering. The wings (whoosh) unfurl

1393
01:57:04,162 --> 01:57:09,875
outward. Its head looks down upon you directly.

1394
01:57:09,875 --> 01:57:11,289
"Burt."

1395
01:57:11,289 --> 01:57:18,410
(laughter)

1396
01:57:18,410 --> 01:57:27,913
MATT: "You say you're from the Slayer's Take. I
have not lived these hundred years or so to become

1397
01:57:27,913 --> 01:57:43,074
"the hunted. I am the hunter! I am the scourge of
the Thorain Tundra! I am the stalker of this

1398
01:57:43,074 --> 01:57:56,253
"timberland. Well. Parts of you shall adorn my
walls, glittering in pieces for times to come.

1399
01:57:56,253 --> 01:58:06,651
"Giants. To my side! Tonight, you choose whether I
dine on you or just them."

1400
01:58:06,651 --> 01:58:10,043
MARY: I use-- fuck me.

1401
01:58:10,043 --> 01:58:12,662
(laughter)

1402
01:58:12,662 --> 01:58:14,941
TALIESIN: I don't know if you have that spell.

1403
01:58:14,941 --> 01:58:17,362
FELICIA: Really, what's the DC on that?

1404
01:58:17,362 --> 01:58:25,633
MARY: It's very high! I use Awakened Mind to once
more say, now we have seen what you have been

1405
01:58:25,633 --> 01:58:33,483
through. We see the terror that you face every day
from this awful beast. This is your chance. You

1406
01:58:33,483 --> 01:58:39,766
may not have another. Fight him with us and
destroy this beast forever.

1407
01:58:39,766 --> 01:58:43,663
MATT: Make a persuasion check versus the dragon's
intimidation check.

1408
01:58:43,663 --> 01:58:47,274
SAM: Oh, versus a dragon!

1409
01:58:47,274 --> 01:58:56,773
LAURA: Natural 20 all the way. Natural 20. I've
had my bow notched, and I cast Hunter's Mark while

1410
01:58:56,773 --> 01:58:58,213
all this is going on.

1411
01:58:58,213 --> 01:59:03,744
MARY: 18. 18 plus what?

1412
01:59:03,744 --> 01:59:05,753
SAM: What is it, persuasion?

1413
01:59:05,753 --> 01:59:07,165
MATT: Persuasion.

1414
01:59:07,165 --> 01:59:11,305
MARY: Plus nine. 27.

1415
01:59:11,305 --> 01:59:19,126
MATT: The giants look at each other, and they look
down at the rest of you. They pull their axes out,

1416
01:59:19,126 --> 01:59:25,140
shields at the ready, and look back up at
Rimefang, and in Giant you hear, muttered under

1417
01:59:25,140 --> 01:59:27,980
their breath, "It's now or never."

1418
01:59:27,980 --> 01:59:29,837
(cheering)

1419
01:59:29,837 --> 01:59:31,245
MATT: Roll initiative.

1420
01:59:31,245 --> 01:59:32,703
MARY: Yes!

1421
01:59:32,703 --> 01:59:38,386
LAURA, FELICIA, and TALIESIN: Oh my god.

1422
01:59:38,386 --> 01:59:40,789
FELICIA: Oh, I rolled lower!

1423
01:59:40,789 --> 01:59:42,512
LAURA: I rolled a 20.

1424
01:59:42,512 --> 01:59:44,168
TALIESIN: I rolled another 20.

1425
01:59:44,168 --> 01:59:45,491
LAURA: Me too!

1426
01:59:45,491 --> 01:59:48,167
TRAVIS: What is it with you and your 20s?

1427
01:59:48,167 --> 01:59:50,671
TALIESIN: I don't know! I don't know what
happened.

1428
01:59:50,671 --> 01:59:55,245
MATT: Okay, all right. 25 to 20, anyone?

1429
01:59:55,245 --> 01:59:56,395
LAURA: 25.

1430
01:59:56,395 --> 01:59:57,610
TALIESIN: 28.

1431
01:59:57,610 --> 01:59:58,896
MARY: What?!

1432
01:59:58,896 --> 02:00:06,434
MATT: All right. We have Percy, we have Vex,
leaving that up there. All right,

1433
02:00:06,434 --> 02:00:09,420
we have 20 to 15?

1434
02:00:09,420 --> 02:00:12,899
TRAVIS: 19.

1435
02:00:12,899 --> 02:00:17,385
MATT: 19, nice. 15 to ten?

1436
02:00:17,385 --> 02:00:20,484
MARY: 12.

1437
02:00:20,484 --> 02:00:23,990
MATT: 12. Zahra, 12. Ten to five?

1438
02:00:23,990 --> 02:00:25,371
SAM: Seven.

1439
02:00:25,371 --> 02:00:27,640
MATT: Seven for Scanlan. (laughing) what did you
roll?

1440
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:30,833
FELICIA: Negative one!

1441
02:00:30,833 --> 02:00:33,432
(laughter)

1442
02:00:33,432 --> 02:00:35,076
MARY: That's our leader!

1443
02:00:35,076 --> 02:00:36,316
MATT: Did you roll a natural one?

1444
02:00:36,316 --> 02:00:38,737
FELICIA: I rolled a one, and I have a negative
two.

1445
02:00:38,737 --> 02:00:41,042
TRAVIS: On your initiative?!

1446
02:00:41,042 --> 02:00:45,303
FELICIA: Yes! I'm never going. I'm going to just
have a snack.

1447
02:00:45,303 --> 02:00:47,938
TRAVIS: You break out the trail mix.

1448
02:00:47,938 --> 02:00:50,382
TALIESIN: The little gingers come back out.

1449
02:00:50,382 --> 02:00:54,764
FELICIA: Is that a record?

1450
02:00:54,764 --> 02:00:59,549
TRAVIS: That is a record. I don't think we've ever
had a negative initiative.

1451
02:00:59,549 --> 02:01:06,567
MATT: All right, so as the wings unfurl on top of
this platform, the combat round

1452
02:01:06,567 --> 02:01:08,505
begins with Percy.

1453
02:01:08,505 --> 02:01:12,586
TALIESIN: If I take one shot, can I hold my second
shot until an event? Can I time my second shot?

1454
02:01:12,586 --> 02:01:14,883
MATT: No, you'd have to hold your initiative, or
you do all your actions in one round,

1455
02:01:14,883 --> 02:01:15,984
unfortunately.

1456
02:01:15,984 --> 02:01:18,186
TALIESIN: Darn it. What initiative did you roll,
again?

1457
02:01:18,186 --> 02:01:19,814
SAM: Low. Second to last.

1458
02:01:19,814 --> 02:01:32,628
TALIESIN: In that case, I'm going to take a few
steps behind that frozen creature right there. I'm

1459
02:01:32,628 --> 02:01:34,586
going to pull out Bad News.

1460
02:01:34,586 --> 02:01:38,445
MARY, SAM, and TALIESIN: (singing) Bad News!

1461
02:01:38,445 --> 02:01:44,088
TALIESIN: I'm going to aim for the face. I'm going
to take a head shot on him.

1462
02:01:44,088 --> 02:01:48,755
MATT: Okay, the frozen warrior is in front of
you.

1463
02:01:48,755 --> 02:01:51,107
TALIESIN: I'm just using him as partial cover.

1464
02:01:51,107 --> 02:01:53,976
MATT: Okay, so you're behind the creature. Are you
just putting it on it to aim?

1465
02:01:53,976 --> 02:01:58,909
TALIESIN: More or less. I'm using him as a steady
and as partial cover as I take a head shot on the

1466
02:01:58,909 --> 02:02:07,755
dragon. I'm not taking a bonus for damage, no. Oh.
15?

1467
02:02:07,755 --> 02:02:14,302
MATT: 15 unfortunately does not hit. As you shoot,
(gunshot), it actually hits the body but the

1468
02:02:14,302 --> 02:02:19,186
hardness of the dragon's scales ricochets the shot
off, (ricochet sound), you see it impact on some

1469
02:02:19,186 --> 02:02:21,186
part of the far side of the cavern.

1470
02:02:21,186 --> 02:02:27,928
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn a bonus action and
spend another grit point and do another shot.

1471
02:02:27,928 --> 02:02:30,288
MATT: So you're doing your action surge?

1472
02:02:30,288 --> 02:02:31,814
TALIESIN: I'm taking my action surge.

1473
02:02:31,814 --> 02:02:35,576
MATT: Okay, so you use your action surge, and
that's it for this round. You use your first round

1474
02:02:35,576 --> 02:02:38,026
to reload Bad News and place it back up on top.

1475
02:02:38,026 --> 02:02:39,568
TALIESIN: Come on.

1476
02:02:39,568 --> 02:02:41,567
MATT: Another head shot, you said?

1477
02:02:41,567 --> 02:02:56,765
TALIESIN: Yeah. Oh! 19! That's much better. Plus
12, that's 32 to hit. And that's 15 points of

1478
02:02:56,765 --> 02:03:01,406
damage, and head shot means he's got disadvantage
on all attacks for the next round.

1479
02:03:01,406 --> 02:03:12,036
MATT: Okay, good to know. So I'm going to go ahead
and roll. All right, so. (gunshot) From the impact

1480
02:03:12,036 --> 02:03:20,909
of the blast, you see the shot ricochet off of
Rimefang's face. The impact sends a couple pieces

1481
02:03:20,909 --> 02:03:25,009
of white dragon scale shooting off into the
darkness, and the head (grunts) rears from the

1482
02:03:25,009 --> 02:03:32,195
impact, shakes, seemingly loosely shaken by the
impact of the blast. The blowback from the gun

1483
02:03:32,195 --> 02:03:39,007
actually sends a large crack through the physical
body of the ice warrior ahead of you, and it

1484
02:03:39,007 --> 02:03:43,166
collapses into a pile of ice on the ground in
front of you.

1485
02:03:43,166 --> 02:03:47,262
TALIESIN: I feel a little guilty about that. I
feel very guilty about that.

1486
02:03:47,262 --> 02:03:50,044
MATT: You get the feeling that whatever was there
probably has not been alive

1487
02:03:50,044 --> 02:03:51,608
for quite a while.

1488
02:03:51,608 --> 02:03:52,857
TALIESIN: Okay, I feel a little better.

1489
02:03:52,857 --> 02:03:55,057
MATT: Frozen solid. It breaks like the T-1000.

1490
02:03:55,057 --> 02:03:57,150
TALIESIN: And he was the most useful he's ever
been.

1491
02:03:57,150 --> 02:03:59,562
MATT: That ends Percy's turn. We're up at Vex.

1492
02:03:59,562 --> 02:04:07,997
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to cast Lightning Arrow,
and I'm going to attack through my Blazing Bow.

1493
02:04:07,997 --> 02:04:09,448
MATT: All righty.

1494
02:04:09,448 --> 02:04:20,449
LAURA: Okay. Oh, that's good! That is a 25?

1495
02:04:20,449 --> 02:04:24,683
MATT: 25? 25 does hit, yes.

1496
02:04:24,683 --> 02:04:30,090
LAURA: Okay, so that is 4d8 of lightning damage.

1497
02:04:30,090 --> 02:04:34,858
MATT: All right. Saving throw for half? Or just
take it?

1498
02:04:34,858 --> 02:04:36,940
LAURA: Saving throw for half, yes.

1499
02:04:36,940 --> 02:04:39,552
MATT: That's a natural 20 on its saving throw, so
it takes half damage.

1500
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:43,329
FELICIA: That's some stink-eye.

1501
02:04:43,329 --> 02:04:46,716
MATT: Hey, better on a saving throw than on an
attack.

1502
02:04:46,716 --> 02:05:09,675
LAURA: 13 plus six is 19, 20, so ten. Plus regular
damage, right? For my regular. 19. I know. 11 plus

1503
02:05:09,675 --> 02:05:24,190
ten is 21, plus Hunter's Mark is four. And then
plus my Blazing Bow, which adds another ten. Where

1504
02:05:24,190 --> 02:05:30,540
did that land? Shit, balls! I'm so aggressive
right now! I'm going to roll a different one! Oh

1505
02:05:30,540 --> 02:05:38,261
my god. That looks like a one. Oh wow. Two ones.
That's great.

1506
02:05:38,261 --> 02:05:42,952
MATT: So as you pull back your arrow, the actual
shaft begins to spark with bluish energy as you

1507
02:05:42,952 --> 02:05:46,866
release it. The arrow transforms (energy noises)
into an arcing bolt of electrical energy. It

1508
02:05:46,866 --> 02:05:51,306
impacts and courses through the upper torso of the
dragon, as it's (grunts) still trying to shake off

1509
02:05:51,306 --> 02:05:58,558
the damage it took from Percy's attack. It manages
to push off most of the impact, but still takes

1510
02:05:58,558 --> 02:06:02,428
damage from it. There's also a burst of fire from
the impact, as well, you can see a bit of flame

1511
02:06:02,428 --> 02:06:05,329
trickle up the side of his body and it eventually
goes out from the cold in the air.

1512
02:06:05,329 --> 02:06:06,927
LAURA: That was one attack.

1513
02:06:06,927 --> 02:06:08,058
MATT: Yes.

1514
02:06:08,058 --> 02:06:09,232
LAURA: Okay.

1515
02:06:09,232 --> 02:06:11,658
MATT: But was the spell an action?

1516
02:06:11,658 --> 02:06:14,315
LAURA: The Lightning Arrow is a bonus.

1517
02:06:14,315 --> 02:06:20,025
MATT: Oh, okay. So it makes your next attack do
that. Right. Gotcha. So you have one more attack.

1518
02:06:20,025 --> 02:06:25,199
LAURA: So I am going to send Trinket. Where is
he?

1519
02:06:25,199 --> 02:06:27,565
MATT: Trinket's over here with the giants guarding
him.

1520
02:06:27,565 --> 02:06:30,451
LAURA: Dear lord. Can Trinket run around and
attack his butt?

1521
02:06:30,451 --> 02:06:33,094
MATT: It's actually up on top of a 15-foot
platform.

1522
02:06:33,094 --> 02:06:35,526
LAURA: Oh, so Trinket can't do shit right now.

1523
02:06:35,526 --> 02:06:37,353
MATT: Not right now, but Trinket can move if you
like.

1524
02:06:37,353 --> 02:06:39,529
LAURA: Trinket's going to move, and I'm going to
attack again, can I do that?

1525
02:06:39,529 --> 02:06:40,782
MATT: Yeah, you can do that.

1526
02:06:40,782 --> 02:06:42,903
LAURA: We want to spread out.

1527
02:06:42,903 --> 02:06:46,905
MATT: That's as far as Trinket get can get,
there.

1528
02:06:46,905 --> 02:06:48,989
LAURA: Can I attack again?

1529
02:06:48,989 --> 02:06:50,204
MATT: You can, yeah.

1530
02:06:50,204 --> 02:06:58,034
LAURA: All right, I'll hit him again. Okay, just a
regular attack through the bow.

1531
02:06:58,034 --> 02:07:00,720
MATT: Yep. This is your second use of it, though;
you're done with it.

1532
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:03,983
LAURA: Yes. 17.

1533
02:07:03,983 --> 02:07:08,670
MATT: 17. As you fire the arrow, it takes its wing
and (whoosh) batters it out of the way, and the arrow

1534
02:07:08,670 --> 02:07:13,147
shatters in mid air. You see a burst of fire as it
does nothing.

1535
02:07:13,147 --> 02:07:16,550
LAURA: It was a 25 that hit before. What was the
first attack that hit?

1536
02:07:16,550 --> 02:07:19,981
TALIESIN: I was in the 30s.

1537
02:07:19,981 --> 02:07:23,348
MATT: So that ends your turn, Vex. Do you want to
move, or do you want to stay right there?

1538
02:07:23,348 --> 02:07:27,387
LAURA: Can I stealth?

1539
02:07:27,387 --> 02:07:30,027
MATT: (laughs) No, that's a hide action, I think.

1540
02:07:30,027 --> 02:07:33,636
LAURA: Then I'm going to move along the wall
further. Yeah, like that.

1541
02:07:33,636 --> 02:07:42,667
MATT: That ends your turn. Rimefang, now, shaking
off the frustration, looks around the room, lifts

1542
02:07:42,667 --> 02:07:49,814
up on its back hind legs, spreads its wings, and
just gives this large roar. (roars) The entire

1543
02:07:49,814 --> 02:07:54,625
room shakes, and you see pieces of ice and rock
begin to start falling from the ceiling.

1544
02:07:54,625 --> 02:08:14,236
Everybody, go ahead and make a wisdom saving
throw. Everybody. One giant is fine. All right,

1545
02:08:14,236 --> 02:08:18,824
starting with Percy.

1546
02:08:18,824 --> 02:08:20,039
TALIESIN: 12.

1547
02:08:20,039 --> 02:08:20,923
MATT: 12.

1548
02:08:20,923 --> 02:08:22,012
FELICIA: 15.

1549
02:08:22,012 --> 02:08:23,853
SAM: Natural 20, but it becomes 18.

1550
02:08:23,853 --> 02:08:25,007
MATT: Okay.

1551
02:08:25,007 --> 02:08:26,443
FELICIA: Because you're not wise.

1552
02:08:26,443 --> 02:08:27,942
MARY: 21.

1553
02:08:27,942 --> 02:08:30,300
MATT: All right.

1554
02:08:30,300 --> 02:08:32,336
LAURA: Ten.

1555
02:08:32,336 --> 02:08:34,237
MATT: Grog?

1556
02:08:34,237 --> 02:08:35,591
TRAVIS: Nine?

1557
02:08:35,591 --> 02:08:37,872
MATT: That's rough.

1558
02:08:37,872 --> 02:08:39,213
TRAVIS: Very wise.

1559
02:08:39,213 --> 02:08:42,450
SAM: Oh, lots of red circles.

1560
02:08:42,450 --> 02:08:51,047
MATT: All right, so. The sheer amount of presence
that this dragon permeates sends a shiver of fear

1561
02:08:51,047 --> 02:08:59,073
down your spine. Vex, Percy, Grog, and one of the
giants are currently frightened of the dragon.

1562
02:08:59,073 --> 02:09:04,031
While you are frightened, you have disadvantage on
ability checks and attack rolls, and you cannot

1563
02:09:04,031 --> 02:09:06,170
willingly move closer to the dragon.

1564
02:09:06,170 --> 02:09:08,509
LAURA: Is Trinket frightened?

1565
02:09:08,509 --> 02:09:12,340
MATT: Roll for Trinket.

1566
02:09:12,340 --> 02:09:25,504
LAURA: Okay. Come on, Trinket. No! He's probably
pretty frightened. Oh, does that count as

1567
02:09:25,504 --> 02:09:27,056
intimidation?

1568
02:09:27,056 --> 02:09:31,541
MATT: No, it's a wisdom saving throw. So it's
whatever his wisdom bonus is.

1569
02:09:31,541 --> 02:09:33,451
LAURA: He rolled an eight, so I'm guessing he's
pretty scared.

1570
02:09:33,451 --> 02:09:38,158
MATT: Probably scared. Trinket, all of a sudden
also (scared bear noises) backs up a little bit

1571
02:09:38,158 --> 02:09:41,556
and is looking equally frightened, especially
seeing you scared. Trinket feels a moment of fear

1572
02:09:41,556 --> 02:09:42,464
there.

1573
02:09:42,464 --> 02:09:45,386
LAURA: You've still got a really big dick!

1574
02:09:45,386 --> 02:09:47,247
FELICIA: What?

1575
02:09:47,247 --> 02:09:49,397
LAURA: I'm just telling him to encourage him.

1576
02:09:49,397 --> 02:09:52,113
TRAVIS: I missed something.

1577
02:09:52,113 --> 02:09:55,651
SAM: Not the dragon. Although, probably the dragon
too.

1578
02:09:55,651 --> 02:10:05,148
MATT: Rimefang then (whoosh) flies up into the air
for a minute. And then swoops over and lands over

1579
02:10:05,148 --> 02:10:10,296
on this side, and that's going to end its turn.
That brings us to Grog.

1580
02:10:10,296 --> 02:10:12,784
TRAVIS: I got to break it, right?

1581
02:10:12,784 --> 02:10:14,408
MATT: Yeah, you're scared.

1582
02:10:14,408 --> 02:10:22,275
TRAVIS: Rage? I look over my shoulder, terrified,
at the other one that's scared, and I say, repeat

1583
02:10:22,275 --> 02:10:25,187
after me, lads. I would like to rage.

1584
02:10:25,187 --> 02:10:33,428
MATT: You reach into your inner self, and suddenly
you realize this is it. You know dragons, you've

1585
02:10:33,428 --> 02:10:37,427
fought dragons in the past, you've killed dragons
in the past, and you know dragons have been

1586
02:10:37,427 --> 02:10:41,871
responsible for hurting some of your friends and
their families, and through that, that anger just

1587
02:10:41,871 --> 02:10:45,254
billows up from inside, and that fear shakes
from your body.

1588
02:10:45,254 --> 02:10:48,586
TRAVIS: I want to kill a dragon like my friend
Pike did.

1589
02:10:48,586 --> 02:10:51,994
MATT: You're now in a rage. You shake the fear
effect, and you can take the rest of your turn as

1590
02:10:51,994 --> 02:10:53,448
you see fit.

1591
02:10:53,448 --> 02:11:00,449
TRAVIS: (battle cry) I would like to run over that
direction.

1592
02:11:00,449 --> 02:11:02,351
SAM: Oh, you're running away from it?

1593
02:11:02,351 --> 02:11:05,232
MATT: You rage-ran.

1594
02:11:05,232 --> 02:11:09,988
TRAVIS: I rage-ran. Can I attack?

1595
02:11:09,988 --> 02:11:13,026
MATT: You're currently hiding behind a 15-foot
platform.

1596
02:11:13,026 --> 02:11:14,508
TRAVIS: So I can't see beyond it?

1597
02:11:14,508 --> 02:11:18,813
MATT: You're literally hiding from the dragon
right now. Cool. All right, that ends your turn?

1598
02:11:18,813 --> 02:11:20,325
Zahra, you're up.

1599
02:11:20,325 --> 02:11:23,151
MARY: All right, how far away is it from me?

1600
02:11:23,151 --> 02:11:25,918
MATT: It is currently 30 feet from you.

1601
02:11:25,918 --> 02:11:27,474
MARY: All right.

1602
02:11:27,474 --> 02:11:35,244
MATT: Real fast. Grog, make a dexterity saving
throw.

1603
02:11:35,244 --> 02:11:37,736
TRAVIS: 13?

1604
02:11:37,736 --> 02:11:39,414
MATT: 13?

1605
02:11:39,414 --> 02:11:43,354
LAURA: What was that for?

1606
02:11:43,354 --> 02:11:49,925
MATT: As you're running through, all of a sudden
the floor gives out from underneath you, and you

1607
02:11:49,925 --> 02:11:55,073
roll off to the side. You almost fall in, catching
yourself, you slide down into a pit, but manage to

1608
02:11:55,073 --> 02:11:58,335
get your handhold on a piece of stone that's
jutting out of the rock. Pull yourself up.

1609
02:11:58,335 --> 02:12:03,832
Underneath where you were in the ground is a
cracked piece of ice: a pit in the ground.

1610
02:12:03,832 --> 02:12:05,402
LAURA: Seriously?

1611
02:12:05,402 --> 02:12:09,814
MATT: But you're fine. You get back up to your
feet. That could've been really bad. It's about 15

1612
02:12:09,814 --> 02:12:12,200
feet down into these jagged shards of ice.

1613
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:15,653
LAURA: My passive perception is 21. Just for
future reference.

1614
02:12:15,653 --> 02:12:20,217
MATT: Good to know. You also have no light source.
You're at the far back in the darkness. Actually,

1615
02:12:20,217 --> 02:12:22,406
you have Grog around you right now.

1616
02:12:22,406 --> 02:12:24,916
MARY: And I still have Light cast.

1617
02:12:24,916 --> 02:12:28,364
MATT: Yeah, so you're fine. All right. That brings
us to Zahra, once again.

1618
02:12:28,364 --> 02:12:34,094
MARY: I cast my bonus Hex on this beautiful
beast.

1619
02:12:34,094 --> 02:12:36,258
MATT: It is now Hexed, as well.

1620
02:12:36,258 --> 02:12:38,905
SAM: What's that do? What's that?

1621
02:12:38,905 --> 02:12:41,575
MARY: I get extra damage.

1622
02:12:41,575 --> 02:12:46,325
TRAVIS: You sexy tailed bastard.

1623
02:12:46,325 --> 02:12:56,211
MARY: I take my dark dragon staff, and as this
moon orb begins to glow, I cast Witch Bolt-- is

1624
02:12:56,211 --> 02:13:04,313
that it?-- yes! Witch Bolt upon it! Infused with
my own internal moon fire.

1625
02:13:04,313 --> 02:13:08,128
MATT: All right. Do you have to roll to hit on
that one?

1626
02:13:08,128 --> 02:13:12,800
MARY: Witch Bolt? Yeah, what do I do? It's plus
11. 5d12 plus two.

1627
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:17,994
LAURA: Yeah, so roll and then add 11.

1628
02:13:17,994 --> 02:13:19,238
MARY: 13.

1629
02:13:19,238 --> 02:13:20,805
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

1630
02:13:20,805 --> 02:13:24,350
MARY: 24, plus two damage to all spells cast, so
26?

1631
02:13:24,350 --> 02:13:25,998
LAURA: No, that's damage.

1632
02:13:25,998 --> 02:13:27,289
MARY: Oh, sorry, 24.

1633
02:13:27,289 --> 02:13:31,314
MATT: All right, so Witch Bolt does hit. Go ahead
and roll damage for that.

1634
02:13:31,314 --> 02:13:40,154
MARY: So 5d12. Five times. All right. Do math for
me, somebody. What is that? That's a three.

1635
02:13:40,154 --> 02:13:41,901
TRAVIS: Three plus the two, so that's five.

1636
02:13:41,901 --> 02:13:44,251
LAURA: You do it all and then add the two.

1637
02:13:44,251 --> 02:13:45,996
TRAVIS: Oh, gotcha. Seven.

1638
02:13:45,996 --> 02:13:47,624
MARY: That's four.

1639
02:13:47,624 --> 02:13:56,434
TRAVIS: Yeah. Plus four. 19. 26. 38.

1640
02:13:56,434 --> 02:13:57,819
MARY: One more?

1641
02:13:57,819 --> 02:13:59,512
LAURA: No, that's all five.

1642
02:13:59,512 --> 02:14:02,090
MATT: Five, and you add 1d6 to that because of
your Hex.

1643
02:14:02,090 --> 02:14:05,176
LAURA: Plus two, so 38 is 40.

1644
02:14:05,176 --> 02:14:07,640
MARY: One.

1645
02:14:07,640 --> 02:14:09,317
MATT: Okay. So 41 points.

1646
02:14:09,317 --> 02:14:10,557
MARY: Yeah.

1647
02:14:10,557 --> 02:14:14,022
LAURA: Plus anything else? Wait, plus two damage
to all-- oh, but that's already--

1648
02:14:14,022 --> 02:14:15,127
TRAVIS: That's already there.

1649
02:14:15,127 --> 02:14:19,697
MATT: Okay, so. After you Hex it, you can see the
shadows around the dragon begin to form and

1650
02:14:19,697 --> 02:14:25,806
coalesce around its torso, and as it looks around,
these small demonic faces that cackle as bits of

1651
02:14:25,806 --> 02:14:30,889
moonlight begin to pierce through these grins
chokehold around its neck, and as it tries to

1652
02:14:30,889 --> 02:14:38,151
shake it off, you bring your staff forward, and
this bolt of bluish-green electrical energy shakes

1653
02:14:38,151 --> 02:14:44,623
out in what looks like a piercing arc of jagged
moonlight that strikes right into the center of

1654
02:14:44,623 --> 02:14:49,191
the dragon's chest. As it does, the dragon's
nearly pushed off its feet for a second, gathers

1655
02:14:49,191 --> 02:14:55,083
itself, and you can see that energy surrounds it
like magical shackles, it continues to keep its

1656
02:14:55,083 --> 02:15:01,395
hold on the creature, as Witch Bolt does. All
right. Do you wish to move, or are you going to

1657
02:15:01,395 --> 02:15:07,615
stay where you are? You can move 30 feet, six
squares.

1658
02:15:07,615 --> 02:15:13,463
MARY: I'd like to go stand by the giants.

1659
02:15:13,463 --> 02:15:15,138
TRAVIS: You're already there.

1660
02:15:15,138 --> 02:15:19,019
MATT: Yeah, you're right here. It's hard for you
to see because that guy's in the way, but you're

1661
02:15:19,019 --> 02:15:20,160
right there.

1662
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:27,998
MARY: All right. No, the other way. Blinding
players as we go. Where am I? I'm there? I'd like

1663
02:15:27,998 --> 02:15:31,907
to move to the slight cover of the pedestal.

1664
02:15:31,907 --> 02:15:36,713
MATT: You can get that far. All right, so there
you are. That ends your turn, Zahra. Scanlan,

1665
02:15:36,713 --> 02:15:37,933
you're up.

1666
02:15:37,933 --> 02:15:46,609
SAM: My eyes begin to change to a dark shade as I
turn my gaze to the dragon

1667
02:15:46,609 --> 02:15:49,198
and cast Eyebite on him.

1668
02:15:49,198 --> 02:15:50,927
TRAVIS: What? Cast what?

1669
02:15:50,927 --> 02:15:52,490
SAM: Eyebite.

1670
02:15:52,490 --> 02:15:54,406
MATT: All right. And how are you having that
affect him?

1671
02:15:54,406 --> 02:15:58,032
SAM: I would like to sicken him. Give him a little
tummy-ache.

1672
02:15:58,032 --> 02:16:01,530
TRAVIS: Is he going to do the twirls?

1673
02:16:01,530 --> 02:16:03,493
MATT: Okay, we're going to do Eyebite here.

1674
02:16:03,493 --> 02:16:05,735
SAM: Through my Hand Cone of Clarity!

1675
02:16:05,735 --> 02:16:11,171
MATT: All right. So wisdom saving throw for the
dragon. Use my meteor dice one of the fans out

1676
02:16:11,171 --> 02:16:13,675
there sent. All right, what's the DC on that now
total?

1677
02:16:13,675 --> 02:16:15,527
SAM: It's 19.

1678
02:16:15,527 --> 02:16:22,195
MATT: 19. That would fail. It's going to use its
legendary resistance to

1679
02:16:22,195 --> 02:16:24,089
choose to succeed instead.

1680
02:16:24,089 --> 02:16:26,245
SAM: It can just choose to succeed?!

1681
02:16:26,245 --> 02:16:28,886
TRAVIS: How many times can it choose to do that?!

1682
02:16:28,886 --> 02:16:31,172
MATT: Three times per day. Welcome to fighting a
dragon!

1683
02:16:31,172 --> 02:16:33,692
SAM: What? But that was a cool spell!

1684
02:16:33,692 --> 02:16:39,808
MATT: So as your eyes darken, the dragon's
currently surrounded by the Witch Bolt and the Hex

1685
02:16:39,808 --> 02:16:43,445
on the creature. You darken your eyes, and you
look over and see the arcane energy taking your

1686
02:16:43,445 --> 02:16:50,561
vision, its vision, combine it in midair. As you
do, it shakes its head and (roars) shouts. You

1687
02:16:50,561 --> 02:16:53,620
instinctively pull back, and as you do, the spell
drifts away from you and you realize the

1688
02:16:53,620 --> 02:16:55,003
incantation's lost.

1689
02:16:55,003 --> 02:16:57,930
TRAVIS: Percy, use your badass motherfucker feat
to have it work.

1690
02:16:57,930 --> 02:17:02,768
SAM: Okay, can I throw with a bonus action?

1691
02:17:02,768 --> 02:17:05,868
MATT: What are you going to throw?

1692
02:17:05,868 --> 02:17:07,298
SAM: A bag.

1693
02:17:07,298 --> 02:17:11,488
MATT: No, that's probably more of an action, but
you can drop it as a bonus action.

1694
02:17:11,488 --> 02:17:19,394
SAM: Got it. Then I will move a few steps away. I
can still move and stuff, right? I would like to

1695
02:17:19,394 --> 02:17:24,609
move away from this group of
soon-to-be-blasted-with-dragon-fire people. Just a

1696
02:17:24,609 --> 02:17:27,262
few yards away to my left.

1697
02:17:27,262 --> 02:17:28,680
MATT: All right.

1698
02:17:28,680 --> 02:17:40,913
SAM: That's fine, sure, that's great. And give
some inspiration to Lyra. I'll say, (singing) When

1699
02:17:40,913 --> 02:17:46,242
the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie,
that's Aldor-e.

1700
02:17:46,242 --> 02:17:48,758
(cheering)

1701
02:17:48,758 --> 02:17:51,005
TRAVIS: Yeah, going deep.

1702
02:17:51,005 --> 02:17:57,465
MATT: And suddenly, the fear that's getting close
to clutching your heart and giving you every

1703
02:17:57,465 --> 02:18:01,702
instinct to run from this, you hear the name
Aldor, and you feel that surge of warmth fill your

1704
02:18:01,702 --> 02:18:06,307
body, and the need to push on forward. Go ahead
and take a d10 inspiration dice to use in any roll

1705
02:18:06,307 --> 02:18:07,358
you want.

1706
02:18:07,358 --> 02:18:09,008
FELICIA: Oh my gosh, thank you so much. That's
beautiful.

1707
02:18:09,008 --> 02:18:10,539
SAM: Well, I wrote it for you.

1708
02:18:10,539 --> 02:18:16,848
MATT: All right. That ends your turn, Scanlan. Now
the giants go. This one is going to move to the

1709
02:18:16,848 --> 02:18:21,076
side. It's deathly afraid of the dragon, it's
like, this is a bad idea, it's really regretting

1710
02:18:21,076 --> 02:18:24,105
its decision. It's going to attempt to shake the
effect. And does so.

1711
02:18:24,105 --> 02:18:26,599
(cheering)

1712
02:18:26,599 --> 02:18:32,757
MATT: Shakes its fright. The other one is going to
step over you. As you're like, all of a sudden

1713
02:18:32,757 --> 02:18:35,657
this foot goes (wham) in front of you, you're
like, (nervous sound).

1714
02:18:35,657 --> 02:18:37,438
FELICIA: Oh my god, I got hit with his dick.

1715
02:18:37,438 --> 02:18:39,282
(laughter)

1716
02:18:39,282 --> 02:18:40,648
TRAVIS: What were their names? Ace and Base?

1717
02:18:40,648 --> 02:18:43,930
SAM and MARY: Ace and Gary.

1718
02:18:43,930 --> 02:18:47,427
MATT: The giant's going to move forward. It's
going to attempt to make two strikes with its

1719
02:18:47,427 --> 02:18:58,045
greataxe. That's going to be a 17, that misses.
And a 16, that misses. (whooshing) Makes two

1720
02:18:58,045 --> 02:19:01,501
strikes to the dragon, and it just dodges out of
the way. The second one, it reaches up with its

1721
02:19:01,501 --> 02:19:05,831
claw and slaps, just parries its axe out of the
way and just glares at it, and you can see at that

1722
02:19:05,831 --> 02:19:12,016
moment, the giant also itself is like (growls).
Ending their turn. Lyra, you're up.

1723
02:19:12,016 --> 02:19:18,258
FELICIA: Oh, what? Finally me? All right. I am
going to get my big spell out. Now, can I target

1724
02:19:18,258 --> 02:19:23,522
its wing and try to Disintegrate-- can I try to
cut its wing off?

1725
02:19:23,522 --> 02:19:27,257
MATT: You know what, yeah, if you want to go ahead
and try that. It's going to be a disadvantage on

1726
02:19:27,257 --> 02:19:28,524
the attack roll.

1727
02:19:28,524 --> 02:19:29,889
FELICIA: What is that?

1728
02:19:29,889 --> 02:19:31,627
TRAVIS: Roll it twice and you get the lower
number.

1729
02:19:31,627 --> 02:19:33,220
MATT: But does Disintegrate have--

1730
02:19:33,220 --> 02:19:34,448
FELICIA: It doesn't have a DC.

1731
02:19:34,448 --> 02:19:36,349
MATT: Then it would have an advantage on the
saving throw.

1732
02:19:36,349 --> 02:19:40,718
FELICIA: Oh, okay. No, I'm going to try to hit it.
It's my big gun, I don't want to be like, sorry.

1733
02:19:40,718 --> 02:19:43,761
I'm like, I just did this and it looked amazing.

1734
02:19:43,761 --> 02:19:47,338
SAM: Which one are you doing?

1735
02:19:47,338 --> 02:19:56,276
FELICIA: I'm doing Disintegrate. And it's 10d6
plus a d10, plus 40. Right? It's not the best

1736
02:19:56,276 --> 02:19:59,065
roll, guys. There's a lot of small numbers here.

1737
02:19:59,065 --> 02:20:01,366
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's only got plus 40. It's a pretty
shrimpy hit.

1738
02:20:01,366 --> 02:20:03,630
LAURA: Wait, plus 40?

1739
02:20:03,630 --> 02:20:06,904
MATT: Yeah, it's 10d6 plus 40 force damage.

1740
02:20:06,904 --> 02:20:08,762
TRAVIS: I need to get a wand.

1741
02:20:08,762 --> 02:20:10,459
MATT: Disintegrate's nasty.

1742
02:20:10,459 --> 02:20:12,090
FELICIA: 39.

1743
02:20:12,090 --> 02:20:17,589
MATT: 39 plus 40? All right, that's 79 points of
damage. What's the DC? It's 17 on that for your

1744
02:20:17,589 --> 02:20:18,648
spells?

1745
02:20:18,648 --> 02:20:20,137
FELICIA: Yes.

1746
02:20:20,137 --> 02:20:25,006
MATT: It does make its saving throw, so half
damage. But rounding up, that's 40 damage still.

1747
02:20:25,006 --> 02:20:31,530
40 force damage to the dragon. As you, with the
swelling of energy that Scanlan gave you reminding

1748
02:20:31,530 --> 02:20:36,676
you of Aldor, you release and once again that
sickeningly green beam of arcane energy just

1749
02:20:36,676 --> 02:20:41,175
streaks out, hits the dragon, and with a burst of
arcane energy you can see part of its scales have

1750
02:20:41,175 --> 02:20:46,579
withered, part of its wing is now tattered and
missing, and immediately the physical form of the

1751
02:20:46,579 --> 02:20:48,609
dragon, it's reeling in pain.

1752
02:20:48,609 --> 02:20:51,218
LAURA: So if we aim at that area that doesn't have
scales...

1753
02:20:51,218 --> 02:20:53,756
MATT: You'll find out.

1754
02:20:53,756 --> 02:20:56,970
MARY: But you've still got the Witch Bolt wrapping
around him, yeah?

1755
02:20:56,970 --> 02:20:58,798
MATT: That is focused.

1756
02:20:58,798 --> 02:21:08,949
FELICIA: I definitely want to move. I want to move
over there behind that-- over here. Yeah. So I'm a

1757
02:21:08,949 --> 02:21:10,608
little less conspicuous.

1758
02:21:10,608 --> 02:21:17,089
MATT: All righty. Cool. That will be the top of
the round. Percy, you're up.

1759
02:21:17,089 --> 02:21:19,083
TALIESIN: Still no hand-grenade.

1760
02:21:19,083 --> 02:21:23,613
MATT: No. The fear has shaken you, so you cannot
move closer to it, and you have disadvantage on

1761
02:21:23,613 --> 02:21:24,873
attacks.

1762
02:21:24,873 --> 02:21:26,663
TALIESIN: What do I do to shake the fear?

1763
02:21:26,663 --> 02:21:30,396
MATT: At the end of your turn, you make a saving
throw to try and shake it. You can't move closer

1764
02:21:30,396 --> 02:21:33,401
to it, but you can still attack it. You cannot
move closer to it, and your attacks have

1765
02:21:33,401 --> 02:21:34,651
disadvantage.

1766
02:21:34,651 --> 02:21:42,140
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to try and take a shot
at it with a standard shot for right now.

1767
02:21:42,140 --> 02:21:49,900
MATT: Okay. So because you've shot, reloaded,
shot, reloaded. Go for it.

1768
02:21:49,900 --> 02:21:56,666
TALIESIN: 17. Wait, and with disadvantage.

1769
02:21:56,666 --> 02:22:00,264
FELICIA: Oh no. That's a great 20 you can't use.

1770
02:22:00,264 --> 02:22:07,261
MATT: Yeah. So a total of 17? As you fire, it
would've hit, unfortunately it streaks through the

1771
02:22:07,261 --> 02:22:13,860
portion of the wing that currently is left a
gaping hole thanks to the Disintegrate spell, the

1772
02:22:13,860 --> 02:22:18,041
impact of the bullet itself blasting against the
back wall, sending chunks and shards of ice

1773
02:22:18,041 --> 02:22:19,709
spilling off in the distance.

1774
02:22:19,709 --> 02:22:24,542
TALIESIN: I would like to really quickly then go
into that little corner there for some cover.

1775
02:22:24,542 --> 02:22:32,250
MATT: Okay. All right. Cool, so that ends your
turn. Vex, you're up next.

1776
02:22:32,250 --> 02:22:35,306
TALIESIN: Oh, I didn't roll to shake off the
fear.

1777
02:22:35,306 --> 02:22:38,118
MATT: Go ahead and make the save.

1778
02:22:38,118 --> 02:22:39,420
TRAVIS: (singing) Shake it off.

1779
02:22:39,420 --> 02:22:41,375
ALL: (singing) Shake it off!

1780
02:22:41,375 --> 02:22:42,587
MATT: What'd you roll?

1781
02:22:42,587 --> 02:22:43,648
TALIESIN: Five.

1782
02:22:43,648 --> 02:22:48,999
MATT: Five, yeah. The fear is still clutching you
internally, like, "Shit, dragon, bad, dragon!"

1783
02:22:48,999 --> 02:22:52,151
Vex.

1784
02:22:52,151 --> 02:22:53,824
LAURA: Can I see him at all?

1785
02:22:53,824 --> 02:22:58,278
MATT: Right now? No. You can see parts of the
wings fluttering over, but you don't have a very

1786
02:22:58,278 --> 02:22:59,520
good visual on it.

1787
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:00,544
LAURA: And he's pretty far away?

1788
02:23:00,544 --> 02:23:02,204
MATT: He's decent distance, yeah.

1789
02:23:02,204 --> 02:23:06,550
LAURA: If I just try to (bowstring noise) up?

1790
02:23:06,550 --> 02:23:11,008
MATT: You can try to. It has three-quarters cover,
so it gets a plus five to its armor class.

1791
02:23:11,008 --> 02:23:18,706
LAURA: And I'm at disadvantage. Does it seem like
if I cast something that would do mass damage,

1792
02:23:18,706 --> 02:23:23,613
would the giant then not want to attack with us
anymore?

1793
02:23:23,613 --> 02:23:26,268
MATT: That's a risk you'd have to take.

1794
02:23:26,268 --> 02:23:29,299
TRAVIS: Drop some stank on that dragon.

1795
02:23:29,299 --> 02:23:40,452
LAURA: I'm scared to hit the giant with it.
Because I want to do Conjure Barrage, but I'm

1796
02:23:40,452 --> 02:23:42,212
afraid of the giant.

1797
02:23:42,212 --> 02:23:44,844
FELICIA: Well, if you do damage to him, the spell
breaks.

1798
02:23:44,844 --> 02:23:46,498
LAURA: Exactly. So that would be bad.

1799
02:23:46,498 --> 02:23:49,380
SAM: But he's not fighting for us because of a
spell right now. We convinced him.

1800
02:23:49,380 --> 02:23:50,912
FELICIA and TALIESIN: Well.

1801
02:23:50,912 --> 02:23:52,622
LAURA: Potentially.

1802
02:23:52,622 --> 02:23:56,911
TRAVIS: Look at the poker face on that DM. Giving
up nothing. Giving up nothing!

1803
02:23:56,911 --> 02:23:59,203
FELICIA: Stone-faced.

1804
02:23:59,203 --> 02:24:01,000
LAURA: Should I try it?

1805
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:04,687
TALIESIN: I don't know. What do I know?

1806
02:24:04,687 --> 02:24:11,347
MARY: If we damage it, this spell that I've been
talking to him with goes (poof).

1807
02:24:11,347 --> 02:24:14,958
LAURA: All right, then I'm going to try to hit the
dragon with a regular attack. I'm not going to do

1808
02:24:14,958 --> 02:24:15,884
Conjure Barrage.

1809
02:24:15,884 --> 02:24:17,873
MATT: All right, so what's the first range
increment on your longbow?

1810
02:24:17,873 --> 02:24:19,226
LAURA: It's 120.

1811
02:24:19,226 --> 02:24:21,686
MATT: That's the first range increment? Yeah, it's
a longbow, yeah. So you're not at disadvantage

1812
02:24:21,686 --> 02:24:26,500
from that shot. However, it does have
three-quarters cover. And given that

1813
02:24:26,500 --> 02:24:27,643
circumstance--

1814
02:24:27,643 --> 02:24:29,856
TALIESIN: Does she not have sharpshooter?

1815
02:24:29,856 --> 02:24:37,157
LAURA: I don't. That's not the feat that I took. I
took read lips. I'm really good in populated

1816
02:24:37,157 --> 02:24:38,618
areas.

1817
02:24:38,618 --> 02:24:40,340
MATT: So go for it and roll for the attacks.

1818
02:24:40,340 --> 02:24:45,134
LAURA: Okay, cool. Here we go! Yeah, no. Doesn't
hit.

1819
02:24:45,134 --> 02:24:48,139
(laughter)

1820
02:24:48,139 --> 02:24:50,208
FELICIA: We're going to die!

1821
02:24:50,208 --> 02:24:53,940
MATT: You pull back and release the first arrow.
It actually just barely scrapes the top of the

1822
02:24:53,940 --> 02:24:56,546
platform and shatters across the ice.

1823
02:24:56,546 --> 02:24:58,465
MARY: Come on!

1824
02:24:58,465 --> 02:25:01,513
LAURA: That's better! 27!

1825
02:25:01,513 --> 02:25:05,261
MATT: 27, even with the three-quarters cover, does
hit! Go ahead and roll damage.

1826
02:25:05,261 --> 02:25:07,220
(cheering)

1827
02:25:07,220 --> 02:25:24,024
LAURA: Okay. What is that? 12, 13, 14! Plus a d6,
because I'm badass! Plus six! That's 19. That's

1828
02:25:24,024 --> 02:25:28,146
not even close to 40, but it does something.

1829
02:25:28,146 --> 02:25:33,356
MATT: It's still damage! So as you release the
arrow, it just misses the top of the platform, and

1830
02:25:33,356 --> 02:25:38,190
you get just enough of an angle that it hits one
of the wings as it pulls it up, sticks into the

1831
02:25:38,190 --> 02:25:41,603
part of its hand that crests the top of the wing.
It (growls)--

1832
02:25:41,603 --> 02:25:43,062
LAURA: And I say, fuck you!

1833
02:25:43,062 --> 02:25:47,918
MATT: Okay. And it echoes, "Fuck you, fuck you..."
Do you or Trinket wish to move?

1834
02:25:47,918 --> 02:25:53,579
LAURA: We're as far away as we can be, and I can't
move any closer.

1835
02:25:53,579 --> 02:25:58,304
MATT: That's true. So now you and Trinket both
make wisdom saving throws to try and shake the

1836
02:25:58,304 --> 02:26:04,921
fear. Oh, and you're frightened, so actually, roll
again on the attack. Disadvantage on the attacks.

1837
02:26:04,921 --> 02:26:10,619
Just roll again. You're frightened.

1838
02:26:10,619 --> 02:26:24,560
LAURA: No, both of those sucked. The first one was
20. 20 was the first!

1839
02:26:24,560 --> 02:26:28,801
MATT: So a total of 20 for the second roll?
Well, that would hit. Well no, it has

1840
02:26:28,801 --> 02:26:30,647
three-quarters cover so it wouldn't,
unfortunately.

1841
02:26:30,647 --> 02:26:32,666
LAURA: Matthew Mercer.

1842
02:26:32,666 --> 02:26:37,560
MATT: You were frightened! It's part of the
effect. I had to remind myself that. So the arrow

1843
02:26:37,560 --> 02:26:44,940
splinters off the top of the wing as it reaches
upward, and you still feel the fear clutching your

1844
02:26:44,940 --> 02:26:46,474
physical self.

1845
02:26:46,474 --> 02:26:47,819
LAURA: Now we try to shake it off.

1846
02:26:47,819 --> 02:26:49,062
MATT: Now you try and shake it off.

1847
02:26:49,062 --> 02:26:50,176
LAURA: (sings) I shake it off.

1848
02:26:50,176 --> 02:26:51,592
MARY: (sings) Shake it off!

1849
02:26:51,592 --> 02:26:53,370
MATT: First roll is for you.

1850
02:26:53,370 --> 02:26:59,980
LAURA: I do not succeed. It's a three.

1851
02:26:59,980 --> 02:27:01,901
MATT: That would be a no, sorry. For Trinket?

1852
02:27:01,901 --> 02:27:08,438
LAURA: 20! Why did you say the first one was for
me? Why couldn't the second one be for me?

1853
02:27:08,438 --> 02:27:12,496
MATT: Because that's how it works. So while you're
still scared, you look over and you see Trinket

1854
02:27:12,496 --> 02:27:17,799
shakes it off. Trinket looks over his shoulder at
you and gives you a nod of like, I got this. Turns

1855
02:27:17,799 --> 02:27:25,960
back to the dragon and gives a (roars) giant
grizzly-bear growl and shout at the dragon. Do you

1856
02:27:25,960 --> 02:27:27,712
wish to move at all?

1857
02:27:27,712 --> 02:27:29,042
LAURA: Where is he?

1858
02:27:29,042 --> 02:27:29,908
MATT: Trinket's right here.

1859
02:27:29,908 --> 02:27:34,050
LAURA: He's going to run up for the time being and
hide. Give me this.

1860
02:27:34,050 --> 02:27:37,384
FELICIA: Hide? Why is everyone hiding?!

1861
02:27:37,384 --> 02:27:41,021
LAURA: He's not hiding! He's going to run up to
this area so that he's got a better vantage point

1862
02:27:41,021 --> 02:27:42,481
to run up for the next turn.

1863
02:27:42,481 --> 02:27:45,223
MATT: That's about as far as Trinket can get right
there.

1864
02:27:45,223 --> 02:27:47,202
LAURA: He can't get any further into this little
crevice?

1865
02:27:47,202 --> 02:27:48,251
MATT: Unfortunately, no.

1866
02:27:48,251 --> 02:27:49,920
LAURA: Can he run right here?

1867
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:53,276
MATT: Trinket could move here instead. That's as
far as Trinket could move on his movement.

1868
02:27:53,276 --> 02:27:55,187
LAURA: That's not really protecting him, is it?

1869
02:27:55,187 --> 02:27:58,225
MATT: No, but it's not over in a cluster of other
people.

1870
02:27:58,225 --> 02:27:59,497
LAURA: All right.

1871
02:27:59,497 --> 02:28:04,576
MATT: All right. Does that end your turn?
Rimefang, who currently has this giant in its

1872
02:28:04,576 --> 02:28:14,455
face, angrily decides to instead, as a legendary
action at the end of your turn, actually, before

1873
02:28:14,455 --> 02:28:20,884
it takes its turn as you've misfired and Trinket's
running along, it's going to go ahead and use one

1874
02:28:20,884 --> 02:28:25,623
of its legendary actions to do a wing attack
against the giant in front of it.

1875
02:28:25,623 --> 02:28:27,806
MARY: No, Derek!

1876
02:28:27,806 --> 02:28:32,512
TRAVIS: (laughs) Derek. It's Gary.

1877
02:28:32,512 --> 02:28:37,267
MARY: Gary. He told me telepathically that his
name is actually Derek.

1878
02:28:37,267 --> 02:28:42,399
MATT: This is an interesting point. Remember, this
is a dragon. It's your favored enemy. So keep that in

1879
02:28:42,399 --> 02:28:45,261
mind, you have an advantage on attacks against
it.

1880
02:28:45,261 --> 02:28:49,950
LAURA: Do I? No, I don't. I looked it up today,
yo. I don't get shit on attacks for him because we

1881
02:28:49,950 --> 02:28:54,706
transferred over from Pathfinder. All I can do is
talk to him.

1882
02:28:54,706 --> 02:28:56,742
MATT: The chat keeps yelling that the favored
enemy--

1883
02:28:56,742 --> 02:29:00,162
LAURA: Well, chat, I looked it up, and I don't
think I have advantage.

1884
02:29:00,162 --> 02:29:03,091
MATT: That's true, chat. You're wrong.

1885
02:29:03,091 --> 02:29:05,505
(shouting)

1886
02:29:05,505 --> 02:29:10,883
LAURA: I literally texted Matt today and I was
super upset.

1887
02:29:10,883 --> 02:29:13,841
ZAC: Did chat try to challenge the DM?

1888
02:29:13,841 --> 02:29:15,068
MATT: Apparently.

1889
02:29:15,068 --> 02:29:19,794
LAURA: Seriously, I thought I had it, too, and
then I looked it up. In fifth edition,

1890
02:29:19,794 --> 02:29:21,476
I don't get that.

1891
02:29:21,476 --> 02:29:24,553
MATT: As a favored enemy, she gets benefits, but
not specifically in battle. It's more about

1892
02:29:24,553 --> 02:29:25,454
knowing--

1893
02:29:25,454 --> 02:29:29,582
SAM: I appreciate the chat. Please, keep it
coming.

1894
02:29:29,582 --> 02:29:33,539
MARY: Couldn't that inspire Vex in some way? Don't
you get an inspiration roll from the chat?

1895
02:29:33,539 --> 02:29:34,790
MATT: Sorry.

1896
02:29:34,790 --> 02:29:39,198
FELICIA: You know what's good is that it's a
different team next week, because we're all going

1897
02:29:39,198 --> 02:29:40,288
to die.

1898
02:29:40,288 --> 02:29:45,091
MARY: No! Lyra, you're our leader, come on!

1899
02:29:45,091 --> 02:29:49,019
MATT: Sorry, chat. You're wrong. Tried to go with
you there, but you're wrong.

1900
02:29:49,019 --> 02:29:51,961
LAURA: I shouldn't have even said anything, I
should've just gone with you. I'm an idiot.

1901
02:29:51,961 --> 02:29:58,820
MATT: That's okay. No worries, but thank you for
being honest and wrong, chat. All right,

1902
02:29:58,820 --> 02:30:03,733
nevertheless. It's going to do a wing attack
against the giant in front of it. The giant is

1903
02:30:03,733 --> 02:30:14,513
trying to make a dexterity saving throw. Does not.
The giant is knocked prone from the wings (whoosh)

1904
02:30:14,513 --> 02:30:20,123
buffeting it with wind as it begins to take off,
knocking the giant back and dealing 13 points of

1905
02:30:20,123 --> 02:30:30,788
bludgeoning damage. The dragon then picks up and
lands right there. And rears back its head

1906
02:30:30,788 --> 02:30:39,699
(snarling roar) and unleashes a torrent of
freezing cold dragon's breath. A 60-foot cone.

1907
02:30:39,699 --> 02:30:45,320
It's going to hit the giant, it's going to hit
Lyra, and it's going to hit Percy.

1908
02:30:45,320 --> 02:30:47,091
TALIESIN: Do I not have some cover?

1909
02:30:47,091 --> 02:30:53,737
MATT: Not against dragon's breath, unfortunately.
So I need both of you guys to go ahead and make a

1910
02:30:53,737 --> 02:31:01,334
constitution saving throw from the sheer freezing
cold.

1911
02:31:01,334 --> 02:31:03,180
FELICIA: Oh no. That didn't go well for me.

1912
02:31:03,180 --> 02:31:04,436
SAM: Plus three.

1913
02:31:04,436 --> 02:31:08,648
FELICIA: Oh, that's true. No, that's damage.

1914
02:31:08,648 --> 02:31:10,148
TALIESIN: 20.

1915
02:31:10,148 --> 02:31:14,651
SAM: Wait. She gets my inspiration on this throw.

1916
02:31:14,651 --> 02:31:16,216
MATT: If she chooses to use it, yes.

1917
02:31:16,216 --> 02:31:17,694
FELICIA: Yes, I definitely want to use it.

1918
02:31:17,694 --> 02:31:19,495
MATT: So add a d10 to what you rolled.

1919
02:31:19,495 --> 02:31:22,980
FELICIA: Ten! Thank god, because that's a 21.

1920
02:31:22,980 --> 02:31:28,925
MATT: 21, okay. All right, so both of you take
half of the 54 damage it would've dealt.

1921
02:31:28,925 --> 02:31:32,565
LAURA: 54 damage?

1922
02:31:32,565 --> 02:31:39,421
MATT: You both take 27 points of cold damage. The
giant that had been partially disintegrated before

1923
02:31:39,421 --> 02:31:45,974
by Lyra now takes the brunt of the frozen damage,
and you can now see the ice begins to build up

1924
02:31:45,974 --> 02:31:55,618
around it as it (gurgling) gurgles as its life's
blood is now stilled. While frozen in place, the

1925
02:31:55,618 --> 02:32:00,652
ice around its physical form holding it there as a
statue of death. The giant is no more.

1926
02:32:00,652 --> 02:32:02,114
TRAVIS and MARY: No!

1927
02:32:02,114 --> 02:32:03,554
LAURA: What? No!

1928
02:32:03,554 --> 02:32:08,501
SAM: Grog, go get his axe! It's really big!

1929
02:32:08,501 --> 02:32:13,263
LAURA: Is it too big to carry? He's got a flaming
axe right now.

1930
02:32:13,263 --> 02:32:16,151
MATT: All right, and that ends Rimefang's turn.
Grog, you're up.

1931
02:32:16,151 --> 02:32:21,695
TRAVIS: I would like to race back from whence I
came to attack his right flank, if I could.

1932
02:32:21,695 --> 02:32:26,014
MATT: You could get there. You will have to make--
actually, no, you can move through there without

1933
02:32:26,014 --> 02:32:26,990
an issue.

1934
02:32:26,990 --> 02:32:28,760
TRAVIS: Also, I have darkvision up to 60 feet.

1935
02:32:28,760 --> 02:32:33,125
MATT: You rush up towards the dragon.

1936
02:32:33,125 --> 02:32:39,961
TRAVIS: I'd like to take my Firebrand Warhammer
and activate it. Ignite it.

1937
02:32:39,961 --> 02:32:42,955
MATT: As a bonus action. Well, it's already been
ignited, you've had it flaming this whole time.

1938
02:32:42,955 --> 02:32:47,111
TRAVIS: Oh, beautiful, yeah. It's like a torch,
which means I can see even better. I'd like to go

1939
02:32:47,111 --> 02:32:50,895
into a frenzied rage and start swinging away.

1940
02:32:50,895 --> 02:32:53,656
MATT: All right, so three attacks on the big old
dragon.

1941
02:32:53,656 --> 02:32:55,102
TRAVIS: 19.

1942
02:32:55,102 --> 02:32:56,558
MATT: 19 does hit.

1943
02:32:56,558 --> 02:32:58,136
TRAVIS: Beautiful. 25.

1944
02:32:58,136 --> 02:32:59,526
MATT: Does hit.

1945
02:32:59,526 --> 02:33:01,385
TRAVIS: And 23.

1946
02:33:01,385 --> 02:33:03,219
MATT: All three hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

1947
02:33:03,219 --> 02:33:11,005
LAURA: Okay, so this is the new thing. d10 plus
five plus eight. Plus another--

1948
02:33:11,005 --> 02:33:12,268
TRAVIS: d10?

1949
02:33:12,268 --> 02:33:13,702
LAURA: Yeah.

1950
02:33:13,702 --> 02:33:18,097
MATT: You're hitting with a weapon that's not as
big as your greataxe, but you do an additional 1d6

1951
02:33:18,097 --> 02:33:19,514
fire damage when you hit.

1952
02:33:19,514 --> 02:33:22,244
TRAVIS: Holy shit. Ah!

1953
02:33:22,244 --> 02:33:26,113
MATT: d10 and a d6 together three times. Plus
eight to each.

1954
02:33:26,113 --> 02:33:27,739
TRAVIS: Three d10s?

1955
02:33:27,739 --> 02:33:29,746
LAURA: Yes. Plus 3d6.

1956
02:33:29,746 --> 02:33:31,378
MATT: Plus eight to what you roll on both of
those.

1957
02:33:31,378 --> 02:33:33,277
TRAVIS: You threw a bunch of numbers at me.

1958
02:33:33,277 --> 02:33:36,317
MATT: All right, so a d10 and a d6 plus eight.

1959
02:33:36,317 --> 02:33:41,075
TRAVIS: 19.

1960
02:33:41,075 --> 02:33:42,245
MATT: 19 damage.

1961
02:33:42,245 --> 02:33:47,735
TRAVIS: Do I do that three times? Oh, wow. 19, and
that's 12.

1962
02:33:47,735 --> 02:33:49,293
MATT: 12, all right.

1963
02:33:49,293 --> 02:33:51,455
TRAVIS: 12 and then, help me numbers, that's--

1964
02:33:51,455 --> 02:33:54,951
LAURA: Oh, that's good, 16. Plus? Ooh. 21.

1965
02:33:54,951 --> 02:34:00,914
MATT: Nice. (whack) As you bring the warhammer
down, it smacks the side of the dragon, the flames

1966
02:34:00,914 --> 02:34:05,018
all of a sudden burst off of it from the impact,
you can see as you pull back, the white scales are

1967
02:34:05,018 --> 02:34:10,180
burned and charred and blackened behind from the
first attack. You bring it back, slam again on the

1968
02:34:10,180 --> 02:34:15,744
second part. As you do, the dragon roars
out in pain, the actual force of the impact almost

1969
02:34:15,744 --> 02:34:20,213
sending it to catch itself on the other side of
its body. Its head swings around to look at

1970
02:34:20,213 --> 02:34:24,937
whoever's slamming it in the side as you bring the
hammer back, swing underneath and then hit it from

1971
02:34:24,937 --> 02:34:28,304
underneath the bottom of its torso, right where
its ribs would be, with a (crunch) crack sound.

1972
02:34:28,304 --> 02:34:32,958
You hit it a third time, leaving a second giant
charred mark where you made impact.

1973
02:34:32,958 --> 02:34:34,370
TRAVIS: Yes!

1974
02:34:34,370 --> 02:34:37,754
MATT: That'll end your turn. Zahra, you're up.

1975
02:34:37,754 --> 02:34:40,691
MARY: All right, I've still got Witch Bolt.

1976
02:34:40,691 --> 02:34:41,693
MATT: You do.

1977
02:34:41,693 --> 02:34:43,043
MARY: And it's still going, yes?

1978
02:34:43,043 --> 02:34:47,461
MATT: You don't have to roll to attack again. You
just use your action.

1979
02:34:47,461 --> 02:34:53,017
MARY: I just fucking keep going with the fucking
Witch Bolt. Can I use a cantrip, or will that

1980
02:34:53,017 --> 02:34:54,125
dispel the Witch Bolt?

1981
02:34:54,125 --> 02:34:58,381
MATT: No, because most cantrips take an action. So
you would not be able to. The Witch Bolt is your

1982
02:34:58,381 --> 02:35:07,260
action. Almost all cantrips are actions to use
them, so you'd be either able to use your action

1983
02:35:07,260 --> 02:35:09,401
and the Witch Bolt, or use the cantrip. Your
choice.

1984
02:35:09,401 --> 02:35:12,141
MARY: No, no, I'm going to stick with Witch Bolt.
I'm very happy with this.

1985
02:35:12,141 --> 02:35:19,158
MATT: So you focus yet again, your eyes still
glowing in that strange, midnight moon color with

1986
02:35:19,158 --> 02:35:23,620
this black smoke that's framing the side of it.
You take your staff and force your will through it

1987
02:35:23,620 --> 02:35:28,668
once again. That connection between you and the
dragon and that weird swirling greenish-blue

1988
02:35:28,668 --> 02:35:31,815
energy that surrounds the dragon connects with
your staff. And as it does, it sends another bolt

1989
02:35:31,815 --> 02:35:37,139
of otherworldly energy careening into the side of
the dragon. Go ahead and roll damage.

1990
02:35:37,139 --> 02:35:41,936
LAURA: I watch her with my mouth agape.

1991
02:35:41,936 --> 02:35:46,042
TRAVIS: d12.

1992
02:35:46,042 --> 02:35:47,692
LAURA: Five times.

1993
02:35:47,692 --> 02:35:49,433
TRAVIS: We got you.

1994
02:35:49,433 --> 02:35:53,681
MARY: 12. 17.

1995
02:35:53,681 --> 02:35:56,619
TRAVIS: 19.

1996
02:35:56,619 --> 02:35:59,836
LAURA and TRAVIS: Ooh, 30.

1997
02:35:59,836 --> 02:36:02,930
LAURA and MARY: 37.

1998
02:36:02,930 --> 02:36:04,197
LAURA: And one more.

1999
02:36:04,197 --> 02:36:05,902
TRAVIS: No, that's five.

2000
02:36:05,902 --> 02:36:08,269
MATT: That was five. Then you roll a 1d6 on top of
that.

2001
02:36:08,269 --> 02:36:10,068
MARY: Plus two on that.

2002
02:36:10,068 --> 02:36:13,237
MATT: All right, so 38, then a d6 from your Hex.

2003
02:36:13,237 --> 02:36:14,521
MARY: Six.

2004
02:36:14,521 --> 02:36:17,371
MATT: So 44 points of damage.

2005
02:36:17,371 --> 02:36:18,585
LAURA: Nice!

2006
02:36:18,585 --> 02:36:24,536
MATT: As it once again, a giant piece of the
dragon's scales shatter off the side, like you're

2007
02:36:24,536 --> 02:36:30,572
cracking into the center of an icy, mountainous
cragside. It's starting to show a little bit of

2008
02:36:30,572 --> 02:36:36,381
damage. You guys are definitely taking this battle
head-on pretty well so far.

2009
02:36:36,381 --> 02:36:38,151
TRAVIS: I don't like the way he said that.

2010
02:36:38,151 --> 02:36:40,511
MATT: You're going to stay where you are, or are
you going to move?

2011
02:36:40,511 --> 02:36:42,666
MARY: How close am I to it?

2012
02:36:42,666 --> 02:36:45,831
MATT: You're currently 20 feet away from the
dragon. 15 is between the two of you.

2013
02:36:45,831 --> 02:36:50,548
MARY: All right. I stay within 30 feet of it.

2014
02:36:50,548 --> 02:36:53,401
MATT: All right, so you want to move this way?

2015
02:36:53,401 --> 02:37:01,934
MARY: I want to get up to the heavens. Oh, sorry.
I'm going to actually, you know what? I'm going to

2016
02:37:01,934 --> 02:37:04,391
move three feet backwards, that's it.

2017
02:37:04,391 --> 02:37:08,503
MATT: Okay, so you just step back? Okay. There you
go. All right. That ends Zahra's turn. Scanlan,

2018
02:37:08,503 --> 02:37:09,632
you're up.

2019
02:37:09,632 --> 02:37:10,962
SAM: How close am I?

2020
02:37:10,962 --> 02:37:13,474
MATT: You are currently about 20 feet away from
the dragon.

2021
02:37:13,474 --> 02:37:23,548
SAM: All right. Yes. Hi. Scanlan here. I'll do,
(singing) It's Bigby's Hand! Bigby's Hand.

2022
02:37:23,548 --> 02:37:27,516
Shamone. I'll just punch him in his dragon face.

2023
02:37:27,516 --> 02:37:33,289
MATT: (laughs) Okay. You do a quick little hand
gesture, hum to yourself the arcane ritual, and a

2024
02:37:33,289 --> 02:37:41,083
very large, mystical see-through replica of your
fist appears in the air above you and goes

2025
02:37:41,083 --> 02:37:50,644
spinning off in the air in an arc. Straight up
Popeye-punching towards the dragon. (laughs) Let's

2026
02:37:50,644 --> 02:37:53,668
go ahead, and Bigby-- what do you have to roll for
that?

2027
02:37:53,668 --> 02:37:56,379
SAM: Oh, I have to roll for that?

2028
02:37:56,379 --> 02:38:00,804
MATT: Let me see what the effect is on that,
remind myself real fast. Bigby's Hand. All right,

2029
02:38:00,804 --> 02:38:09,439
so it's an AC of 20. Or no, that's the hand, all
right. Clenched fist, cool. So make a melee spell

2030
02:38:09,439 --> 02:38:12,285
attack. So roll a d20 and then add your spell
attack modifier.

2031
02:38:12,285 --> 02:38:15,720
SAM: That's the spell attack bonus thing? Okay.
19.

2032
02:38:15,720 --> 02:38:22,155
MATT: 19. (wham) Just barely hits as the fist goes
slamming into the side of the dragon's face, big

2033
02:38:22,155 --> 02:38:27,024
old Popeye punch to the side of the jaw. So go
ahead and roll 4d8 points of force damage.

2034
02:38:27,024 --> 02:38:38,196
SAM: 4d8. I'm taking yours, and I hope that's
okay. Ten, 13, 18, 21. Plus something?

2035
02:38:38,196 --> 02:38:45,057
MATT: That's 21 points of damage, nice. (whack) It
gets socked in the jaw. The hand whips around

2036
02:38:45,057 --> 02:38:49,296
again, preparing for the next round. Do you want
to use anything, move, use your bonus action?

2037
02:38:49,296 --> 02:38:59,640
SAM: I'm 20 feet away. I will go 18 feet away from
it and drop the grenade.

2038
02:38:59,640 --> 02:39:02,472
MATT: Okay. So you move forward right here?

2039
02:39:02,472 --> 02:39:05,274
SAM: Yeah, closer to it.

2040
02:39:05,274 --> 02:39:11,787
MATT: Okay. The grenade is right there on the
ground that Percy made. All right. Going to stay

2041
02:39:11,787 --> 02:39:12,961
where you are?

2042
02:39:12,961 --> 02:39:14,346
SAM: Can I keep moving?

2043
02:39:14,346 --> 02:39:18,143
MATT: You can keep moving. You moved 18 feet
backward, you mean?

2044
02:39:18,143 --> 02:39:20,187
SAM: No, I had to move closer to it.

2045
02:39:20,187 --> 02:39:23,551
MATT: Right, so you moved three feet of your 25
feet, dropped it, and you still have 22 feet you

2046
02:39:23,551 --> 02:39:24,955
can move.

2047
02:39:24,955 --> 02:39:26,854
SAM: But if I leave, he's going to whack me.

2048
02:39:26,854 --> 02:39:30,307
MATT: No, he's this far away. You have to be
within a certain range for him to hit you.

2049
02:39:30,307 --> 02:39:32,268
SAM: Wait, how close did I put the grenade to
him?

2050
02:39:32,268 --> 02:39:34,389
MATT: It's currently 18 feet away from him.

2051
02:39:34,389 --> 02:39:36,534
SAM: No, I wanted to put it <i>two</i> feet away from
him.

2052
02:39:36,534 --> 02:39:44,976
MATT: Oh, I see! There, that makes more sense. So
now there is a grenade on the ground, right there.

2053
02:39:44,976 --> 02:39:50,858
You are there, right next to Grog. So yeah, you
cannot move away without it taking a swipe.

2054
02:39:50,858 --> 02:39:52,036
TRAVIS: Oh, look at that.

2055
02:39:52,036 --> 02:39:53,171
SAM: Hello, I'm a little gnome.

2056
02:39:53,171 --> 02:39:54,460
TRAVIS: It's adorable.

2057
02:39:54,460 --> 02:40:05,055
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. The giant
that's here gets up. That's half of its movement.

2058
02:40:05,055 --> 02:40:10,941
It's enough to get there, moves up behind and is
going to make two of its axe-swipes.

2059
02:40:10,941 --> 02:40:12,433
MARY: Hit him in the arse!

2060
02:40:12,433 --> 02:40:14,544
FELICIA: Butthole.

2061
02:40:14,544 --> 02:40:17,520
SAM: That was crass.

2062
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:24,232
MATT: 15 doesn't hit. Second attack is going to be
a 13. It's rolling shit. It swings twice and

2063
02:40:24,232 --> 02:40:25,693
manages to catch air.

2064
02:40:25,693 --> 02:40:27,101
FELICIA: The most useless giant.

2065
02:40:27,101 --> 02:40:33,153
MATT: Apparently. But you know what, they didn't
smash you yet. That's a good thing. That brings us

2066
02:40:33,153 --> 02:40:34,482
to Lyra's turn.

2067
02:40:34,482 --> 02:40:37,564
FELICIA: Question. Can I Fireball without hitting
anybody who's friendly?

2068
02:40:37,564 --> 02:40:42,662
MATT: From this point of view, it's going to be
very difficult to pull that off. It's a 20-foot

2069
02:40:42,662 --> 02:40:45,761
radius, so it's going to hit everything within
that sphere.

2070
02:40:45,761 --> 02:40:48,296
TRAVIS: Oh, you actually care about us that much?

2071
02:40:48,296 --> 02:40:53,263
MARY: Can I use-- everybody is really close. All
right.

2072
02:40:53,263 --> 02:41:04,350
FELICIA: Okay, so I can't do that. I think I'm
going to cast Hold Monster.

2073
02:41:04,350 --> 02:41:13,660
MATT: Hold Monster! You take your arcane thoughts
and you put them around, imagining this arcane

2074
02:41:13,660 --> 02:41:18,444
cage that begins to form out of the ether around
the dragon. These bars (crash) and tighten around

2075
02:41:18,444 --> 02:41:21,436
it. The dragon rolls a two for its saving throw.

2076
02:41:21,436 --> 02:41:24,096
(cheering)

2077
02:41:24,096 --> 02:41:26,942
MATT: But it's going to use its Legendary
Resistance to automatically succeed.

2078
02:41:26,942 --> 02:41:28,566
FELICIA: How many of those does he have?!

2079
02:41:28,566 --> 02:41:30,017
TRAVIS: He has one more.

2080
02:41:30,017 --> 02:41:33,385
FELICIA: I need to move.

2081
02:41:33,385 --> 02:41:38,777
MATT: (laughs) The cage tightens around it, and
the dragon takes its wings and (shattering) buffs

2082
02:41:38,777 --> 02:41:41,214
it off, the arcane cage shatters and disappears
into the air.

2083
02:41:41,214 --> 02:41:46,756
FELICIA: I was going to be impressive. Okay. I'm
going to get the H out. I'm going to get as far as

2084
02:41:46,756 --> 02:41:50,666
I can in that corner. Yeah, thank you. Bye-bye.

2085
02:41:50,666 --> 02:41:58,270
MATT: All righty. Good to know. All right, that
ends your turn. That brings us back to the top.

2086
02:41:58,270 --> 02:41:59,755
Percy, you're up.

2087
02:41:59,755 --> 02:42:07,087
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to-- That grenade is
sitting on top of people right now, isn't it?

2088
02:42:07,087 --> 02:42:08,262
MATT: Yeah.

2089
02:42:08,262 --> 02:42:10,162
TRAVIS: You mean that hamster, right?

2090
02:42:10,162 --> 02:42:12,229
MATT: Your call, man.

2091
02:42:12,229 --> 02:42:14,914
TRAVIS: Come on, live a little.

2092
02:42:14,914 --> 02:42:17,434
TALIESIN: It's going to hit you.

2093
02:42:17,434 --> 02:42:18,693
TRAVIS: Well, that's all right.

2094
02:42:18,693 --> 02:42:20,842
LAURA: Yeah, but it's also going to hit Scanlan.

2095
02:42:20,842 --> 02:42:23,674
MATT: You still have disadvantage on your attacks,
by the way.

2096
02:42:23,674 --> 02:42:26,008
TALIESIN: Even if my attack is not against the
dragon?

2097
02:42:26,008 --> 02:42:28,405
MATT: As long as it's within eyesight of you,
you're scared.

2098
02:42:28,405 --> 02:42:31,326
TALIESIN: Okay, in that case, I'm going to take a
shot at the dragon for the moment.

2099
02:42:31,326 --> 02:42:32,373
MATT: Okay.

2100
02:42:32,373 --> 02:42:33,859
TALIESIN: Forget about that.

2101
02:42:33,859 --> 02:42:35,860
MATT: Disadvantage on the shot.

2102
02:42:35,860 --> 02:42:41,593
TALIESIN: 19.

2103
02:42:41,593 --> 02:42:45,067
MATT: 19. That's with disadvantage? Does hit.

2104
02:42:45,067 --> 02:42:47,584
(cheering)

2105
02:42:47,584 --> 02:42:54,523
TALIESIN: Oh, that's nice. 26 points of damage.

2106
02:42:54,523 --> 02:42:56,682
MATT: 26 points of damage, nice.

2107
02:42:56,682 --> 02:42:59,045
SAM: Hey! Percy.

2108
02:42:59,045 --> 02:43:00,738
TALIESIN: I have moments.

2109
02:43:00,738 --> 02:43:05,796
MATT: All right, and you reload with the other
one. You can't move closer to it. Do you wish to

2110
02:43:05,796 --> 02:43:07,012
move at all?

2111
02:43:07,012 --> 02:43:11,267
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to hold my position.

2112
02:43:11,267 --> 02:43:13,074
MATT: Okay. Before the end of your turn--

2113
02:43:13,074 --> 02:43:19,684
TALIESIN: I was about to say, before I do that,
I'm going to use a bonus action to do a quick

2114
02:43:19,684 --> 02:43:22,476
heal. I'm going to use second wind.

2115
02:43:22,476 --> 02:43:26,095
MATT: Oh, a second wind, go for it. So you go
ahead and heal yourself 1d10 plus your level.

2116
02:43:26,095 --> 02:43:28,823
TALIESIN: That's 11 points of damage.

2117
02:43:28,823 --> 02:43:32,793
MATT: There you go. So you heal 11 points of
damage. Before your turn is over, it's going to

2118
02:43:32,793 --> 02:43:37,159
use its last legendary action to take its tail and
swing around and whack it at the gnome that it

2119
02:43:37,159 --> 02:43:42,597
heard sneak up behind it and drop something on the
ground. That's going to be a natural 20.

2120
02:43:42,597 --> 02:43:45,139
(shouting)

2121
02:43:45,139 --> 02:43:49,023
LAURA: He said it so happily, too. Evil.

2122
02:43:49,023 --> 02:43:50,542
TALIESIN: You're in trouble.

2123
02:43:50,542 --> 02:43:52,244
SAM: Wait, what did he do?

2124
02:43:52,244 --> 02:43:56,099
MATT: As you drop it, you look up and see its tail
go (whoosh, whack).

2125
02:43:56,099 --> 02:43:57,838
SAM: Whoa, but can I sing real quick?

2126
02:43:57,838 --> 02:44:00,256
MATT: It's a natural 20. There's no way you can
avoid this hit.

2127
02:44:00,256 --> 02:44:05,967
SAM: Maybe it'll fling me away from the grenade.

2128
02:44:05,967 --> 02:44:07,437
FELICIA: (singing) Bye bye bye.

2129
02:44:07,437 --> 02:44:09,698
TRAVIS: No, not cool!

2130
02:44:09,698 --> 02:44:15,474
MATT: 36 points of bludgeoning damage as the tail
slams down onto you.

2131
02:44:15,474 --> 02:44:17,522
LAURA: And also onto the grenade.

2132
02:44:17,522 --> 02:44:20,317
SAM: But it's not a concussion grenade.

2133
02:44:20,317 --> 02:44:23,028
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm right fucking there! I was going
to move!

2134
02:44:23,028 --> 02:44:24,335
LAURA: I'm sorry!

2135
02:44:24,335 --> 02:44:30,108
MATT: And down onto the grenade you set on the
ground. (boom)

2136
02:44:30,108 --> 02:44:32,936
SAM: Is it a concussion grenade? It's already
armed, isn't it?

2137
02:44:32,936 --> 02:44:36,814
MATT: It is filled with black powder, and is a
triggerable mechanism.

2138
02:44:36,814 --> 02:44:38,866
LAURA: I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that.

2139
02:44:38,866 --> 02:44:46,933
MATT: I appreciate the reminder, because I totally
forgot for a second. As it slams into you and the

2140
02:44:46,933 --> 02:44:51,475
ground, it slams into the grenade and there's an
explosion muffled sound from underneath its tail.

2141
02:44:51,475 --> 02:44:57,938
I want Grog and Scanlan to go ahead and make
dexterity saving throws.

2142
02:44:57,938 --> 02:44:59,331
TRAVIS: Yes! 21.

2143
02:44:59,331 --> 02:45:04,073
LAURA: Come on, Scanlan.

2144
02:45:04,073 --> 02:45:05,313
SAM: 20.

2145
02:45:05,313 --> 02:45:08,595
MATT: All right. Both of you guys manage to keep
low to the ground, avoiding most of the blast.

2146
02:45:08,595 --> 02:45:10,215
SAM: I'm already low to the ground.

2147
02:45:10,215 --> 02:45:19,270
MATT: All right. Both of you guys take half damage
from the strike. You both take 12 points of fire

2148
02:45:19,270 --> 02:45:20,684
and bludgeoning damage.

2149
02:45:20,684 --> 02:45:22,104
LAURA: Did the dragon take damage?

2150
02:45:22,104 --> 02:45:26,120
MATT: The dragon does not make its saving throw
against it, though, and takes the full-- what'd I

2151
02:45:26,120 --> 02:45:27,482
tell you guys? 12?

2152
02:45:27,482 --> 02:45:29,877
SAM: All right! The grenade worked!

2153
02:45:29,877 --> 02:45:32,575
(cheering)

2154
02:45:32,575 --> 02:45:37,314
MATT: Pulls its tail up, and there's like a big
arc of smoke off of its tail as it pulls it up and

2155
02:45:37,314 --> 02:45:39,360
shakes out the pain that it just suffered.

2156
02:45:39,360 --> 02:45:44,285
TALIESIN: Can I take this moment of engineering
success to try and pull a wisdom saving throw

2157
02:45:44,285 --> 02:45:46,021
against my fear that I missed on my turn?

2158
02:45:46,021 --> 02:45:49,356
MATT: That's right, forgot that. So go ahead and
make your wisdom saving throw. The explosion was

2159
02:45:49,356 --> 02:45:50,576
the inspiration you required.

2160
02:45:50,576 --> 02:45:51,665
TALIESIN: Natural 20!

2161
02:45:51,665 --> 02:45:53,711
(cheering)

2162
02:45:53,711 --> 02:45:56,992
TALIESIN: It worked! (cackles)

2163
02:45:56,992 --> 02:46:00,939
MATT: With the explosion the grenade set off, you
realize, wait, you might actually have this, and

2164
02:46:01,039 --> 02:46:03,230
it worked! You could do this!

2165
02:46:03,230 --> 02:46:09,959
TALIESIN: I built a thing! And it blew up! Kind of
on purpose!

2166
02:46:09,959 --> 02:46:14,382
MATT: There you go. At the end of your turn,
that's its final legendary action.

2167
02:46:14,382 --> 02:46:15,956
Vex, you're up.

2168
02:46:15,956 --> 02:46:18,065
LAURA: Can I try to shake off the attack?

2169
02:46:18,065 --> 02:46:19,750
MATT: At the end of your turn, you do.

2170
02:46:19,750 --> 02:46:22,344
LAURA: Oh, at the end. But I was inspired by that
explosion!

2171
02:46:22,344 --> 02:46:27,148
MATT: It was inspiring. It may help you shake it
off at the end of the round.

2172
02:46:27,148 --> 02:46:33,734
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to attack it. Oh, that's
such a good roll.

2173
02:46:33,734 --> 02:46:37,724
MARY: That is. Oh, that's even better!

2174
02:46:37,724 --> 02:46:41,791
LAURA: That's okay. It was a disadvantage. That's
27 with a disadvantage with the exploding arrow.

2175
02:46:41,791 --> 02:46:45,742
MATT: With the Exploding Arrow? That does hit.

2176
02:46:45,742 --> 02:46:48,261
TRAVIS: More Percy goodness.

2177
02:46:48,261 --> 02:46:51,185
LAURA: So what do I do? Do I just roll regular?

2178
02:46:51,185 --> 02:47:01,240
MATT: So go ahead and roll regular arrow damage.
With an additional 2d6. Sorry, 3d6. Well, with the

2179
02:47:01,240 --> 02:47:03,724
arrow, it's 2d6. The grenade was 3d6. You're 2d6.

2180
02:47:03,724 --> 02:47:06,978
LAURA: Oh shit. 16 and then 3d6?

2181
02:47:06,978 --> 02:47:08,541
MATT: 3d8, sorry.

2182
02:47:08,541 --> 02:47:09,722
LAURA: 3d8?!

2183
02:47:09,722 --> 02:47:14,897
MATT: Sorry. 3d8 was the grenade. 2d8 for the
exploding arrow. 2d8.

2184
02:47:14,897 --> 02:47:16,010
LAURA: 2d8.

2185
02:47:16,010 --> 02:47:17,356
MATT: Sorry. It's a lot of numbers.

2186
02:47:17,356 --> 02:47:29,662
LAURA: That's okay, I'm going to roll them both.
Okay. Six additional. Did I say what my other

2187
02:47:29,662 --> 02:47:31,870
damage was. Was I speaking out loud?

2188
02:47:31,870 --> 02:47:38,073
MATT: Yeah, no. I marked it down. I also need
Scanlan and Grog to make dexterity saving throws.

2189
02:47:38,073 --> 02:47:39,864
LAURA: Oh no, I'm sorry, I'm stupid!

2190
02:47:39,864 --> 02:47:41,241
SAM: Wait, what did you just shoot at us?

2191
02:47:41,241 --> 02:47:42,423
LAURA: An exploding arrow!

2192
02:47:42,423 --> 02:47:43,640
SAM: Nice.

2193
02:47:43,640 --> 02:47:45,515
TRAVIS: 18.

2194
02:47:45,515 --> 02:47:46,638
SAM: 11.

2195
02:47:46,638 --> 02:47:47,711
MATT: Okay.

2196
02:47:47,711 --> 02:47:51,903
LAURA: I also meant to say I was shooting from my
Blood-Seeker Bow. I pulled it out and said I was

2197
02:47:51,903 --> 02:47:53,302
going to do it.

2198
02:47:53,302 --> 02:47:54,602
MATT: You pull out your Blood-Seeker Bow?

2199
02:47:54,602 --> 02:47:56,462
LAURA: I was going to shoot from my Blood-Seeker
Bow for that.

2200
02:47:56,462 --> 02:47:57,573
MATT: Okay.

2201
02:47:57,573 --> 02:47:58,728
LAURA: Can I do that?

2202
02:47:58,728 --> 02:48:07,321
MATT: I'll let it. So it is now taking an ongoing
ten points of bleeding damage? Now, you take three

2203
02:48:07,321 --> 02:48:16,085
points of fire damage. Scanlan, you take six
points of fire damage. You guys avoid the grenade,

2204
02:48:16,085 --> 02:48:18,793
and then (arrow noises) a second explosion again.

2205
02:48:18,793 --> 02:48:27,515
TALIESIN: I'm sorry. I'm a genius! I'm sorry!
Sorry! Oh god, I'm clever.

2206
02:48:27,515 --> 02:48:31,898
LAURA: So for my second attack, I want to throw
Trinket in and I want Trinket to

2207
02:48:31,898 --> 02:48:34,117
go up and attack him.

2208
02:48:34,117 --> 02:48:38,664
MATT: Trinket rushes in and is going to make two
attacks at it.

2209
02:48:38,664 --> 02:48:43,418
LAURA: He's going to do two claw attacks, so
that's 2d4 each time.

2210
02:48:43,418 --> 02:48:46,891
MATT: Go for it. So go ahead and roll for the
first strike. He's no longer scared, so Trinket

2211
02:48:46,891 --> 02:48:48,376
does not have the disadvantage.

2212
02:48:48,376 --> 02:48:56,440
LAURA: Okay, he doesn't hit on the first one. But
the second one, he gets a 21!

2213
02:48:56,440 --> 02:48:57,970
MATT: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2214
02:48:57,970 --> 02:49:01,682
LAURA: Yes! Okay. Was I wrong?

2215
02:49:01,682 --> 02:49:04,884
MARY: That's 23.

2216
02:49:04,884 --> 02:49:06,156
LAURA: Oh, okay. Either way.

2217
02:49:06,156 --> 02:49:07,598
MATT: It hits even harder!

2218
02:49:07,598 --> 02:49:08,671
MARY: It hits harder?

2219
02:49:08,671 --> 02:49:13,481
MATT: (Irish accent) Exactly. What's that about?
Rightly so.

2220
02:49:13,481 --> 02:49:17,133
LAURA: That's 13 extra damage for Trinket.

2221
02:49:17,133 --> 02:49:20,322
MATT: 13 extra damage as Trinket runs up, first
strike hits the armor and just streaks across

2222
02:49:20,322 --> 02:49:25,433
without damage, but as soon as the dragon turns
around to see the giant brown bear that has gotten

2223
02:49:25,433 --> 02:49:29,916
brave enough to strike it, its other claw goes and
sinks into the side of one of its calves and tears

2224
02:49:29,916 --> 02:49:36,468
a portion of the dragon's flesh. It (snarls) roars
and Trinket, bringing its claw down, roars back at

2225
02:49:36,468 --> 02:49:44,191
it. Dragon roar versus bear roar. All right. That
ends your turn. It is now Rimefang's turn.

2226
02:49:44,191 --> 02:49:46,019
Rimefang--

2227
02:49:46,019 --> 02:49:50,612
MARY: He has no more of these legendary saves,
yes?

2228
02:49:50,612 --> 02:49:51,987
SAM: No, he has one.

2229
02:49:51,987 --> 02:49:54,159
MATT: Well, one more legendary resistance.

2230
02:49:54,159 --> 02:49:57,308
FELICIA: He used a wing-buffet and then two
saves.

2231
02:49:57,308 --> 02:49:59,080
SAM: He's got one more.

2232
02:49:59,080 --> 02:50:01,441
FELICIA: Oh, one more save. Ugh.

2233
02:50:01,441 --> 02:50:06,690
SAM: If he chooses to use it. He might save it for
later in the fight.

2234
02:50:06,690 --> 02:50:14,760
MATT: Great. So the dragon is now going to
(flapping) fly--

2235
02:50:14,760 --> 02:50:23,137
SAM: No, he won't. I cast a spell on it as it
retreats from me because I am a war caster.

2236
02:50:23,137 --> 02:50:24,779
MATT: Okay.

2237
02:50:24,779 --> 02:50:28,389
SAM: And I will cast Bigby's Hand to grapple that
shit and pull him back down.

2238
02:50:28,389 --> 02:50:30,847
(cheering)

2239
02:50:30,847 --> 02:50:33,919
MATT: That's right, you took the war caster feat.
Okay.

2240
02:50:33,919 --> 02:50:38,811
SAM: Don't you fly away from me, motherfucker!

2241
02:50:38,811 --> 02:50:42,607
TRAVIS: So hot for you right now.

2242
02:50:42,607 --> 02:50:50,677
MATT: All right, so you use your action to do
Bigby's Clenched, no, Grasping Hand. No, it's--

2243
02:50:50,677 --> 02:50:54,521
SAM: It's the grapple one to pull its wings
together so it can't fly away?

2244
02:50:54,521 --> 02:50:59,461
MATT: Yes. All right, so. So you use the hand's
strength score, so go ahead and roll a d20 and

2245
02:50:59,461 --> 02:51:01,153
then add plus eight to it.

2246
02:51:01,153 --> 02:51:03,376
SAM: 18 plus eight. 26.

2247
02:51:03,376 --> 02:51:13,715
MATT: As the dragon brings its wings up, the hand
grabs its wings together and forces it back down

2248
02:51:13,715 --> 02:51:16,901
to the ground. It shakes off the effect, but it's
unable to fly away.

2249
02:51:16,901 --> 02:51:19,377
SAM: You will leave when Burt Reynolds tells you
to leave!

2250
02:51:19,377 --> 02:51:27,960
(laughter)

2251
02:51:27,960 --> 02:51:33,999
MATT: Okay. You also deal 2d6 plus five damage to
it.

2252
02:51:33,999 --> 02:51:38,163
SAM: 2d6. That's another 18.

2253
02:51:38,163 --> 02:51:42,183
MATT: 18 points of damage as the hand crushes on
it, holding it in place, it does not get a chance

2254
02:51:42,183 --> 02:51:55,083
to move. All right. Angrily, in reaction to that,
the dragon-- well, first off let me see. Does not

2255
02:51:55,083 --> 02:51:59,702
get its breath weapon back yet, unfortunately. It
is going to use multiattack, so it gets three

2256
02:51:59,702 --> 02:52:04,402
attacks: one bite and two claw attacks. It's going
to make all of them against you.

2257
02:52:04,402 --> 02:52:07,818
SAM: Of course it does. And thus ends Scanlan.

2258
02:52:07,818 --> 02:52:10,261
TRAVIS and MARY: No!

2259
02:52:10,261 --> 02:52:14,106
MATT: We'll make each attack as it goes. So the
first attack against you is going to be the bite

2260
02:52:14,106 --> 02:52:16,701
attack. That is a 23 to hit?

2261
02:52:16,701 --> 02:52:18,152
SAM: That hits.

2262
02:52:18,152 --> 02:52:19,477
MATT: All right.

2263
02:52:19,477 --> 02:52:20,808
LAURA: Are you unconscious?

2264
02:52:20,808 --> 02:52:22,189
SAM: I will be very soon.

2265
02:52:22,189 --> 02:52:29,519
MATT: That's going to be 18 points of piercing
damage.

2266
02:52:29,519 --> 02:52:31,708
LAURA: Oh no, Scanlan's unconscious!

2267
02:52:31,708 --> 02:52:41,324
MATT: Are you unconscious? Okay. It would be an
additional d8 points of cold damage. Scanlan falls

2268
02:52:41,324 --> 02:52:50,509
unconscious on the ground. It's going to take a
claw attack down. It's already all-in. Its second

2269
02:52:50,509 --> 02:52:58,639
claw attack hits. You immediately fail a death
saving throw from the second strike. The second

2270
02:52:58,639 --> 02:53:02,158
claw attack hits you, as well, as it's focused on
you. You've failed two death saving throws.

2271
02:53:02,158 --> 02:53:03,767
LAURA: Oh my god!

2272
02:53:03,767 --> 02:53:06,254
SAM: It's a dragon.

2273
02:53:06,254 --> 02:53:11,548
MATT: That's the end of his turn. Grog, you're
up.

2274
02:53:11,548 --> 02:53:18,122
TRAVIS: I race over to Scanlan and I pour a
level-3 healing potion into Scanlan's mouth.

2275
02:53:18,122 --> 02:53:24,573
MATT: Okay, so Grog, you use your action to pull
out, grab Scanlan, and pour it into his mouth.

2276
02:53:24,573 --> 02:53:26,852
This is the superior one?

2277
02:53:26,852 --> 02:53:28,234
TRAVIS: Yes.

2278
02:53:28,234 --> 02:53:31,761
MATT: You heal 8d4 plus eight hit points.

2279
02:53:31,761 --> 02:53:33,215
SAM: Do I roll? Does he roll?

2280
02:53:33,215 --> 02:53:34,631
MATT: I'll let you roll for it; it's fine.

2281
02:53:34,631 --> 02:53:37,841
SAM: 8d4? Can I roll 4d8s?

2282
02:53:37,841 --> 02:53:39,912
MATT: (laughs) 8d4.

2283
02:53:39,912 --> 02:53:41,417
SAM: 8d4.

2284
02:53:41,417 --> 02:53:42,824
MATT: You have a better chance, actually.

2285
02:53:42,824 --> 02:53:45,794
TRAVIS: This is my friend of the lady favors. I
need him!

2286
02:53:45,794 --> 02:53:49,709
MATT: As you see the dragon bites down on him, he
falls unconscious on the ground, the ice around

2287
02:53:49,709 --> 02:53:54,425
his wounds, and his eyes just roll back into his
head, unconscious. One claw slams down into his

2288
02:53:54,425 --> 02:54:00,908
body, the gnome shakes from the impact. The second
claw comes down into his torso and pulls back, you

2289
02:54:00,908 --> 02:54:05,507
can see bits of flesh and muscle pull back from
its claw as it pulls away, and Scanlan's on

2290
02:54:05,507 --> 02:54:09,406
death's door. You rush over and grab and lift him
up, take the healing potion, pop off the cork with

2291
02:54:09,406 --> 02:54:15,113
your teeth, and you rage-feed him the potion.
"Drink it!"

2292
02:54:15,113 --> 02:54:17,472
SAM: I'm at 19 now.

2293
02:54:17,472 --> 02:54:23,453
MATT: So you're at 19 hit points and you're
conscious now, the wounds seal up. You've still

2294
02:54:23,453 --> 02:54:26,441
failed two death saving throws. They're gone until
the end of the battle.

2295
02:54:26,441 --> 02:54:30,276
TRAVIS: Can I do anything else after I've poured
it into his-- can I do anything else?

2296
02:54:30,276 --> 02:54:31,774
MATT: You have a bonus action.

2297
02:54:31,774 --> 02:54:36,667
TRAVIS: Can I throw him the fuck away from the
dragon? Pick him up and chuck him towards Lyra?

2298
02:54:36,667 --> 02:54:40,479
MATT: I'll say because you're frenzied raged,
normally you would get an additional attack. I

2299
02:54:40,479 --> 02:54:42,325
will say you can use that.

2300
02:54:42,325 --> 02:54:45,133
TRAVIS: And I won't throw. I'll slide him on the
icy floor towards Lyra.

2301
02:54:45,133 --> 02:54:48,129
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an athletics check.

2302
02:54:48,129 --> 02:54:49,900
TRAVIS: Okay. Natural 20.

2303
02:54:49,900 --> 02:54:52,234
(cheering)

2304
02:54:52,234 --> 02:55:03,157
MATT: As he wakes up, Grog goes (grunts, whoosh)
and slip-n-slides you across the icy floor. You

2305
02:55:03,157 --> 02:55:07,937
come to a stop about 15 feet away-- actually, be
about there. You're still prone; you're on the

2306
02:55:07,937 --> 02:55:08,931
ground.

2307
02:55:08,931 --> 02:55:11,021
LAURA: But you can take a potion on your turn, at
least?

2308
02:55:11,021 --> 02:55:15,759
TRAVIS: And I just turn around and give it the
eyebrow of you're-fucking-dead.

2309
02:55:15,759 --> 02:55:20,476
MATT: (laughs) All right. That ends Grog's turn.
Zahra, you're up.

2310
02:55:20,476 --> 02:55:22,782
MARY: Witch Bolt. Fucking Witch Bolt.

2311
02:55:22,782 --> 02:55:26,139
MATT: By the way, your Bigby's Hand has faded,
because when you fell unconscious you lost

2312
02:55:26,139 --> 02:55:27,997
concentration. Witch Bolt?

2313
02:55:27,997 --> 02:55:33,330
MARY: If you're still within range. I push even
harder for Scanlan's sake.

2314
02:55:33,330 --> 02:55:37,026
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll 5d12, I believe
it is?

2315
02:55:37,026 --> 02:55:42,930
MARY: The fire turns from white to yellow. I'm
raging. What is it?

2316
02:55:42,930 --> 02:55:46,719
MATT: Whatever the spell is. Is it 5d10 or
5d12?

2317
02:55:46,719 --> 02:55:48,351
MARY: It is 5d12.

2318
02:55:48,351 --> 02:55:51,398
MATT: There you go. 5d12 plus 1d6.

2319
02:55:51,398 --> 02:55:57,168
MARY: Eight. Give me some math here, guys.

2320
02:55:57,168 --> 02:56:10,320
TRAVIS: Okay. 14. 29. 45.

2321
02:56:10,320 --> 02:56:12,247
MARY: 45 plus two.

2322
02:56:12,247 --> 02:56:13,639
LAURA: 47.

2323
02:56:13,639 --> 02:56:14,702
MARY: Plus 11 attack.

2324
02:56:14,702 --> 02:56:16,670
LAURA: No, 47, and 1d6.

2325
02:56:16,670 --> 02:56:18,884
MARY: 1d6. Six.

2326
02:56:18,884 --> 02:56:21,432
MATT: All right, so what's the total damage on
that, then?

2327
02:56:21,432 --> 02:56:22,508
LAURA: 53.

2328
02:56:22,508 --> 02:56:24,975
MARY: 51.

2329
02:56:24,975 --> 02:56:26,945
MATT: 51 points of damage.

2330
02:56:26,945 --> 02:56:33,612
TRAVIS: Did I best you on math? It's a dark day
when Grog beats Vex on math.

2331
02:56:33,612 --> 02:56:36,307
MARY: She's very upset about the whole Scanlan
thing.

2332
02:56:36,307 --> 02:56:38,558
LAURA: I'm still very scared!

2333
02:56:38,558 --> 02:56:47,633
MATT: That is nasty. All right, so. As you blast
again, the fury of seeing Scanlan torn down to the

2334
02:56:47,633 --> 02:56:52,310
ground and nearly devoured by this dragon, you
blast again. This time the greenish-blue energy

2335
02:56:52,310 --> 02:56:57,950
flaring up into a vibrant, angry yellow, and now
you can see what once was almost like a bolt of

2336
02:56:57,950 --> 02:57:03,632
arcane moon energy becomes an actual burning fire
in its visual. Do you wish to move, or are you

2337
02:57:03,632 --> 02:57:05,762
going to stay where you are?

2338
02:57:05,762 --> 02:57:07,749
MARY: I'm still how many feet away from him?

2339
02:57:07,749 --> 02:57:12,001
MATT: You are currently 20 feet away from him.

2340
02:57:12,001 --> 02:57:13,555
MARY: I will stay where I am.

2341
02:57:13,555 --> 02:57:14,886
MATT: All right.

2342
02:57:14,886 --> 02:57:22,271
MARY: Can I give-- no I can't, I'd have to go and
give it to him, wouldn't I?

2343
02:57:22,271 --> 02:57:27,474
MATT: At the end of your turn, because it's
regained its legendary actions, it's going to use

2344
02:57:27,474 --> 02:57:33,872
a wing attack against Grog and every creature
around it, including Trinket and the one giant. So

2345
02:57:33,872 --> 02:57:39,432
as it takes the hit from the Witch Bolt, (heavy
breathing) the arcane hand no longer grasping its

2346
02:57:39,432 --> 02:57:44,205
wings, its wings flare out, (whoosh) and swings
around with its wings, hitting everything around

2347
02:57:44,205 --> 02:57:53,579
you. Dexterity saving throw for Grog, for the
giant, and for Trinket. Giant does not make it.

2348
02:57:53,579 --> 02:57:54,714
TRAVIS: 18.

2349
02:57:54,714 --> 02:57:57,609
MATT: 18, it's a DC 19. Make it for Trinket.

2350
02:57:57,609 --> 02:57:58,707
LAURA: Ten.

2351
02:57:58,707 --> 02:58:02,081
MATT: All right, so Trinket and Grog both take 13
points of bludgeoning damage and are both knocked

2352
02:58:02,081 --> 02:58:03,060
prone.

2353
02:58:03,060 --> 02:58:04,661
TRAVIS: Halved, because I'm raging.

2354
02:58:04,661 --> 02:58:06,718
LAURA: Halved, because he's got Stoneskin.

2355
02:58:06,718 --> 02:58:11,110
MATT: Yeah. Trinket takes half damage, as well. So
you both take seven points of bludgeoning damage,

2356
02:58:11,110 --> 02:58:16,537
but you're still knocked prone. You both fall onto
your back. The giant also is knocked prone there.

2357
02:58:16,537 --> 02:58:25,110
All right. That ends Zahra's turn. That brings us
to Scanlan. You're conscious. You're on the

2358
02:58:25,110 --> 02:58:26,053
ground.

2359
02:58:26,053 --> 02:58:28,179
SAM: I will stand.

2360
02:58:28,179 --> 02:58:33,608
MATT: All right. So you still have half your
movement. You can still move roughly ten feet. Any

2361
02:58:33,608 --> 02:58:34,795
direction.

2362
02:58:34,795 --> 02:58:36,885
SAM: Taking a potion is an action or a bonus?

2363
02:58:36,885 --> 02:58:43,497
MATT: I consider it a bonus action to keep things
moving. Action to administer it to somebody else.

2364
02:58:43,497 --> 02:58:44,912
TRAVIS: Do that thing.

2365
02:58:44,912 --> 02:58:47,945
SAM: I will Dimension Door way over there.

2366
02:58:47,945 --> 02:58:55,765
MATT: (laughs) Okay. Scanlan stands up, waves his
hand, and this blackened archway just (whoosh)

2367
02:58:55,765 --> 02:59:00,168
appears next to him with this crackling sound of
energy. He leaps through it and vanishes out of

2368
02:59:00,168 --> 02:59:05,374
sight. You are now in darkness, you cannot see
anything except for a little bit of light bouncing

2369
02:59:05,374 --> 02:59:08,695
off of the top of the cavern, glittering across
all the ice crystals, but you are in complete

2370
02:59:08,695 --> 02:59:10,843
shadow. (breathing heavily)

2371
02:59:10,843 --> 02:59:15,578
SAM: And I'll take one of those four healing
potions that someone gave us. Were they moderate?

2372
02:59:15,578 --> 02:59:17,567
MATT: They were superior. I think Grog used one.

2373
02:59:17,567 --> 02:59:19,349
FELICIA: Yeah, we handed them out.

2374
02:59:19,349 --> 02:59:22,133
SAM: Okay, I definitely have one, so I'll take
it.

2375
02:59:22,133 --> 02:59:24,176
MATT: 8d4 plus eight.

2376
02:59:24,176 --> 02:59:25,299
LAURA: Who all took them?

2377
02:59:25,299 --> 02:59:27,219
MARY: I didn't, because I have two.

2378
02:59:27,219 --> 02:59:28,893
FELICIA: I don't think she and I took them.

2379
02:59:28,893 --> 02:59:31,596
LAURA: Oh, the four of us, because we're
assholes?

2380
02:59:31,596 --> 02:59:32,994
MATT: I think you each took one.

2381
02:59:32,994 --> 02:59:34,494
FELICIA: I sacrificed myself.

2382
02:59:34,494 --> 02:59:38,951
MATT: So we'll consider that. It's fine. All
right, so that ends Scanlan's turn. The giant is

2383
02:59:38,951 --> 02:59:41,390
going to get up.

2384
02:59:41,390 --> 02:59:43,147
TRAVIS: Get up, Gary, you piece of shit!

2385
02:59:43,147 --> 02:59:50,124
MATT: That would be a 21. That hits. And that'll
be a 17. That misses. But it does manage to hit

2386
02:59:50,124 --> 03:00:03,682
with an attack, finally. This whole time. That's
24 points of slashing damage to the dragon. As its

2387
03:00:03,682 --> 03:00:07,771
first strike whiffs, and as it brings it back with
a backhand, it brings its shield up to protect

2388
03:00:07,771 --> 03:00:17,150
itself. The axe (smack) lands a good seven to
eight inches into the dragon's hide. (roars) The

2389
03:00:17,150 --> 03:00:28,119
head turns around. "You traitor! I will eat every
one of you!" That ends the giant's turn. It's

2390
03:00:28,119 --> 03:00:33,575
going to stay right there, trying to finish him
off. That ends the giant's turn. Lyra, you're up.

2391
03:00:33,575 --> 03:00:36,170
FELICIA: I still can't Fireball, right?

2392
03:00:36,170 --> 03:00:42,494
MATT: You could? Depending on where you want to
place it, you may hit other things.

2393
03:00:42,494 --> 03:00:48,655
LAURA: You can place it-- hit the giant and the
dragon.

2394
03:00:48,655 --> 03:00:54,693
FELICIA: Then the giant will wake up. If we hit
the giants-- does he look almost dead?

2395
03:00:54,693 --> 03:00:58,832
MATT: You can tell he's taken a few hits from the
dragon, but the other one is the one that was

2396
03:00:58,832 --> 03:01:00,092
completely wrecked.

2397
03:01:00,092 --> 03:01:01,478
LAURA: Is the other giant dead?

2398
03:01:01,478 --> 03:01:05,226
MATT: It is frozen in place and dead. It was
partially disintegrated by Lyra earlier, and the

2399
03:01:05,226 --> 03:01:07,227
frost breath finished it off.

2400
03:01:07,227 --> 03:01:09,466
FELICIA: I could maybe hit Trinket or Grog?

2401
03:01:09,466 --> 03:01:10,690
SAM: Trinket's protected.

2402
03:01:10,690 --> 03:01:18,518
FELICIA: I don't think he's protected from fire
damage. It's a lot of damage. I don't want to kill

2403
03:01:18,518 --> 03:01:19,704
Trinket.

2404
03:01:19,704 --> 03:01:22,683
TRAVIS: Is it fire, and it's a frost dragon?

2405
03:01:22,683 --> 03:01:30,074
FELICIA: It's a very big spell. It's 8d6. Can't
really use it. I'll try to Hold Monster again.

2406
03:01:30,074 --> 03:01:33,473
LAURA: How much radius does the dragon take up?

2407
03:01:33,473 --> 03:01:41,820
MATT: The dragon itself is 15 feet across on each
side, so if you were to hit the dragon, it would

2408
03:01:41,820 --> 03:01:43,692
still hit everything directly around it.

2409
03:01:43,692 --> 03:01:48,683
FELICIA: Yeah, let me try to Hold Monster again.
At least force him to use his thing.

2410
03:01:48,683 --> 03:01:55,149
MATT: All right. Actually, he fails his saving
throw, but uses his third and final legendary

2411
03:01:55,149 --> 03:01:58,303
resistance to resist the Hold Monster spell.

2412
03:01:58,303 --> 03:02:00,927
TALIESIN: Good, you drained it. That's over with.

2413
03:02:00,927 --> 03:02:04,810
MATT: He's out of legendary resistance. He turns
around and looks at you now. It was currently

2414
03:02:04,810 --> 03:02:10,544
glaring at the giant, growling at everyone around
it, and as soon as that spell hits it with the

2415
03:02:10,544 --> 03:02:15,584
cage once again, (heavy impacts) it breaks it with
its wings and turns around, (whoosh) and opens its

2416
03:02:15,584 --> 03:02:17,725
mouth right towards you.

2417
03:02:17,725 --> 03:02:20,196
FELICIA: I'm going to move away as far as I can.

2418
03:02:20,196 --> 03:02:22,160
MATT: Okay. So you are here.

2419
03:02:22,160 --> 03:02:25,961
FELICIA: Yes. That's very far. Yes. Thank you.

2420
03:02:25,961 --> 03:02:32,673
MATT: Okay. All right, that ends your turn. Back
up to Percy.

2421
03:02:32,673 --> 03:02:38,076
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to take one last
really good shot. I'm going to shoot him right in

2422
03:02:38,076 --> 03:02:43,546
the face again. I'm going to spend my grit point
and hit him in the face. Let's make this work.

2423
03:02:43,546 --> 03:02:52,697
Yay! That hits. That's 31 to hit.

2424
03:02:52,697 --> 03:02:57,027
MATT: 31 will hit, yeah. Go ahead and roll
damage.

2425
03:02:57,027 --> 03:03:06,154
TALIESIN: I'm going to roll damage. That's 15
points of damage, but he's got disadvantage on all

2426
03:03:06,154 --> 03:03:07,804
attacks until my turn.

2427
03:03:07,804 --> 03:03:11,386
MATT: He did take ten points of bleeding damage
from your-- Laura. It did take ten points of

2428
03:03:11,386 --> 03:03:18,549
bleeding damage from your bow, and it does save
against the bleed effect, so that's gone,

2429
03:03:18,549 --> 03:03:21,093
unfortunately. But you did ten additional damage
to him.

2430
03:03:21,093 --> 03:03:25,326
TALIESIN: I'm going to move in this direction. Hug
the wall.

2431
03:03:25,326 --> 03:03:27,295
MATT: Right there?

2432
03:03:27,295 --> 03:03:28,576
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think right there.

2433
03:03:28,576 --> 03:03:35,344
MATT: Okay. So as you take your shot, (gunshot) it
ricochets off the armor. The dragon's starting to

2434
03:03:35,344 --> 03:03:38,348
look a little rough. You can see bits of the blood
beginning to seep from the inside of its scales.

2435
03:03:38,348 --> 03:03:42,898
It's starting to look a little harsher and
harsher. It's still standing up pretty well, but

2436
03:03:42,898 --> 03:03:46,629
you can see, it's starting to get a little more
battle-worn. That ends Percy's turn.

2437
03:03:46,629 --> 03:03:47,878
Vex, you're up.

2438
03:03:47,878 --> 03:03:48,719
LAURA: Me?

2439
03:03:48,719 --> 03:03:49,682
MATT: Yes.

2440
03:03:49,682 --> 03:03:51,736
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to move Trinket away.

2441
03:03:51,736 --> 03:03:54,897
MATT: Trinket stands up, and Trinket's going to
move back this way.

2442
03:03:54,897 --> 03:03:59,772
LAURA: Yeah, and then hide behind that outcropping
thing. Yeah.

2443
03:03:59,772 --> 03:04:04,170
MATT: Okay. As he moves away, the dragon uses his
reaction. It's going to be a bite attack on him,

2444
03:04:04,170 --> 03:04:05,284
actually.

2445
03:04:05,284 --> 03:04:06,455
TALIESIN: With disadvantage.

2446
03:04:06,455 --> 03:04:08,646
MATT: With disadvantage?

2447
03:04:08,646 --> 03:04:09,926
TALIESIN: With disadvantage.

2448
03:04:09,926 --> 03:04:13,451
MATT: Oh, because of the head shot. Yeah. Well, it
rolled a two and a 15.

2449
03:04:13,451 --> 03:04:15,858
(cheering)

2450
03:04:15,858 --> 03:04:21,320
MATT: So thank god you put that on there. So as it
(whoosh) lashes out, Trinket's armor actually

2451
03:04:21,320 --> 03:04:26,848
takes the impact, and some of the teeth crack a
little bit against the armor, and the jaw pulls

2452
03:04:26,848 --> 03:04:31,742
back as Trinket just (bear moan) runs off behind
the ice wall. What are you doing?

2453
03:04:31,742 --> 03:04:34,320
LAURA: I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns.

2454
03:04:34,320 --> 03:04:38,365
MATT: Did you make a wisdom save last turn to try
to resist the fear effect?

2455
03:04:38,365 --> 03:04:39,851
LAURA: I did, and I failed it.

2456
03:04:39,851 --> 03:04:41,031
MATT: That's right. Okay.

2457
03:04:41,031 --> 03:04:46,622
LAURA: Yeah. So I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns
on the dragon.

2458
03:04:46,622 --> 03:04:50,785
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll for attack.

2459
03:04:50,785 --> 03:04:54,141
LAURA: 26.

2460
03:04:54,141 --> 03:04:58,553
MATT: 26 hits, yes. Hail of Thorns. What's the
radius on that?

2461
03:04:58,553 --> 03:05:04,233
LAURA: That's a good question. Hail of Thorns.

2462
03:05:04,233 --> 03:05:05,916
MATT: (laughs) How's that go?

2463
03:05:05,916 --> 03:05:14,291
LAURA: Okay, wait. Next time you hit a creature
with a ranged weapon-- spell-- range. It just hits

2464
03:05:14,291 --> 03:05:19,567
it, but then everything within five feet makes a
dexterity saving throw. Sorry, guys.

2465
03:05:19,567 --> 03:05:26,876
MATT: So Grog, make a dexterity saving throw.
Because you're prone, I'd say with disadvantage.

2466
03:05:26,876 --> 03:05:28,539
LAURA: Oh. Sorry, Grog.

2467
03:05:28,539 --> 03:05:31,728
TRAVIS: Nine?

2468
03:05:31,728 --> 03:05:33,293
MATT: Actually, you're fine. Just straight roll.

2469
03:05:33,293 --> 03:05:34,456
TRAVIS: Oh, great. 18.

2470
03:05:34,456 --> 03:05:43,074
MATT: 18? All right. You take half of the 1d10
piercing damage. So roll for the actual arrow

2471
03:05:43,074 --> 03:05:52,228
damage, and then 1d10. The giant does not make it,
and the dragon does not make it. They both fail.

2472
03:05:52,228 --> 03:05:55,792
LAURA: 13 for the actual arrow, plus another five
for Hunter's Mark.

2473
03:05:55,792 --> 03:06:00,043
MATT: All right. What's the 1d10 for the Hail of
Thorns?

2474
03:06:00,043 --> 03:06:06,120
LAURA: 3d10 because I'm casting it at 3rd level.
18 for the Hail of Thorns.

2475
03:06:06,120 --> 03:06:12,101
MATT: 18. So that's nine points of damage to you,
Grog. Nine points to the giant, and nine points to

2476
03:06:12,101 --> 03:06:15,863
the dragon. All right.

2477
03:06:15,863 --> 03:06:18,406
LAURA: Oh. And then I get another attack.

2478
03:06:18,406 --> 03:06:20,256
MATT: You do. You have two attacks.

2479
03:06:20,256 --> 03:06:31,430
LAURA: (giggles) This is crazy! Okay, so I'm going
to-- should I do Conjure Barrage? Conjure Barrage

2480
03:06:31,430 --> 03:06:35,789
at them, as well.

2481
03:06:35,789 --> 03:06:42,309
MATT: All right. Conjure Barrage is an action to
cast, right?

2482
03:06:42,309 --> 03:06:48,526
LAURA: Oh, you're right. So a regular. I can only
do a regular attack. Okay, so regular attack. Oh,

2483
03:06:48,526 --> 03:06:50,483
that doesn't hit. That's a 16.

2484
03:06:50,483 --> 03:06:53,744
MATT: That unfortunately does not hit. Well, it
hits, but the arrow shatters across the dragon's

2485
03:06:53,744 --> 03:07:00,257
armor. All right, that ends your turn. As the
giant takes a blasting impact of thorns across its

2486
03:07:00,257 --> 03:07:07,571
torso, it looks to the dragon, Rimefang. Looks at
the rest of you, which some of you have fallen,

2487
03:07:07,571 --> 03:07:13,696
some of you are on the ground. It decides that
perhaps it chose its alliances poorly. And you can

2488
03:07:13,696 --> 03:07:17,946
see, it takes its axe and shield ready, and almost
in a phalanx format is now alongside the dragon.

2489
03:07:17,946 --> 03:07:28,718
All right, that brings us to Rimefang's turn.
Rimefang is going to (flapping) fly up in the

2490
03:07:28,718 --> 03:07:30,006
air.

2491
03:07:30,006 --> 03:07:42,178
TRAVIS: Oh, he's reaching for shit. He duplicates
himself into another dragon. Now you're all dead.

2492
03:07:42,178 --> 03:07:44,435
MATT: Now he's going to--

2493
03:07:44,435 --> 03:07:48,195
TRAVIS: Oh no, the ale's gone!

2494
03:07:48,195 --> 03:08:01,941
MATT: This way, up at the top, and is currently up
in the air (flapping). Let's see. He gets his cold

2495
03:08:01,941 --> 03:08:05,706
breath back. Oh, did you roll to try and shake the
frightened effect, by the way?

2496
03:08:05,706 --> 03:08:06,725
LAURA: I didn't.

2497
03:08:06,725 --> 03:08:08,387
MATT: Go ahead and do that now.

2498
03:08:08,387 --> 03:08:10,876
MARY: Come on, darling. Come on!

2499
03:08:10,876 --> 03:08:14,662
LAURA and TRAVIS: Natural 20!

2500
03:08:14,662 --> 03:08:20,345
MATT: That will do it. As you shake the frightened
effect, you're like, "Ah! All right." You're

2501
03:08:20,345 --> 03:08:23,651
steeled. "No, I know these guys. I'm trying to
kill these guys." As you see it fly overhead.

2502
03:08:23,651 --> 03:08:29,284
Rears back its head and then (whoosh) arc across
the ground with its breath weapon, hitting Percy,

2503
03:08:29,284 --> 03:08:34,668
Vex, and Lyra. You guys all need to make
constitution saving throws.

2504
03:08:34,668 --> 03:08:37,513
TALIESIN: Oh, so there's no disadvantage roll for
him to make here, is there?

2505
03:08:37,513 --> 03:08:38,893
MATT: No.

2506
03:08:38,893 --> 03:08:40,148
FELICIA: 23.

2507
03:08:40,148 --> 03:08:41,828
MATT: 23 on the constitution saving throw?

2508
03:08:41,828 --> 03:08:45,077
FELICIA: Yeah, I actually. I get five
constitution, and I rolled an 18.

2509
03:08:45,077 --> 03:08:47,335
TALIESIN: 15.

2510
03:08:47,335 --> 03:08:51,495
MATT: 15? What did you roll, Vex?

2511
03:08:51,495 --> 03:08:53,275
LAURA: 18.

2512
03:08:53,275 --> 03:09:01,816
MATT: 18. All right. (chuckles) So as the ice
breath (whoosh) passes across, it's like every

2513
03:09:01,816 --> 03:09:07,949
center point of the worst ice storm or blizzard
impacting you with a series of punches every

2514
03:09:07,949 --> 03:09:14,746
single second as this breath caresses and beats
your body left and right. Both of you guys take 54

2515
03:09:14,746 --> 03:09:16,224
points of cold damage.

2516
03:09:16,224 --> 03:09:17,887
TALIESIN: 54?

2517
03:09:17,887 --> 03:09:22,863
MATT: 54. Lyra, you take 27 points of cold
damage.

2518
03:09:22,863 --> 03:09:29,149
TRAVIS: And the room gets quiet.

2519
03:09:29,149 --> 03:09:30,838
MARY: Really fast.

2520
03:09:30,838 --> 03:09:36,509
MATT: It continues its flight pattern (flapping,
impacts) and lands on top of this upper platform.

2521
03:09:36,509 --> 03:09:39,826
LAURA: Oh, he's got another fucking platform?

2522
03:09:39,826 --> 03:09:41,477
SAM: How high up?

2523
03:09:41,477 --> 03:09:48,982
MATT: That's ten feet up. There are two platforms
on opposite sides of this room now. That ends its

2524
03:09:48,982 --> 03:09:53,016
turn. It is now Grog's turn.

2525
03:09:53,016 --> 03:09:56,417
TRAVIS: That giant is definitely against us?

2526
03:09:56,417 --> 03:10:02,549
MATT: It looks to be questioning its loyalty at
the moment, yeah.

2527
03:10:02,549 --> 03:10:06,432
TRAVIS: You questioned at the wrong time. I charge
Gary and hack away.

2528
03:10:06,432 --> 03:10:10,355
MATT: All right. You get up, and you have enough
movement, definitely, to move up into battle with

2529
03:10:10,355 --> 03:10:11,688
him. Go ahead and attack.

2530
03:10:11,688 --> 03:10:22,523
TRAVIS: (laughs) What do I do, again? What is this
shit? This thing plus five. 16. No, attack bonus.

2531
03:10:22,523 --> 03:10:24,328
MATT: You have to hit first. You have to roll to
hit.

2532
03:10:24,328 --> 03:10:27,054
TRAVIS: I know. Jesus! It's like I've never done
this before. 24.

2533
03:10:27,054 --> 03:10:28,985
LAURA: No, that was higher than 24.

2534
03:10:28,985 --> 03:10:32,184
TRAVIS: 16 plus nine? Oh, it's 25.

2535
03:10:32,184 --> 03:10:34,237
MATT: Hits. Roll a second attack.

2536
03:10:34,237 --> 03:10:36,799
TRAVIS: 28.

2537
03:10:36,799 --> 03:10:38,073
MATT: Hits.

2538
03:10:38,073 --> 03:10:39,682
TRAVIS: And 20.

2539
03:10:39,682 --> 03:10:42,673
MATT: 20 hits. Roll damage against the giant.

2540
03:10:42,673 --> 03:10:49,629
TRAVIS: (quietly) What is this, 1d10 plus five?
Oh, that's ten. 18. 18?

2541
03:10:49,629 --> 03:10:52,768
LAURA: Plus six fire damage.

2542
03:10:52,768 --> 03:10:53,754
TRAVIS: Oh.

2543
03:10:53,754 --> 03:10:55,743
LAURA: Six!

2544
03:10:55,743 --> 03:10:58,048
TRAVIS: 24 on the first one.

2545
03:10:58,048 --> 03:10:59,205
MATT: Nice.

2546
03:10:59,205 --> 03:11:04,800
TRAVIS: Sorry, new math. 13 plus-- 17 on the
second one.

2547
03:11:04,800 --> 03:11:06,366
MATT: All right, and the third one?

2548
03:11:06,366 --> 03:11:11,121
TRAVIS: 12, plus-- 15 on the third one.

2549
03:11:11,121 --> 03:11:17,431
MATT: As you rush forward, (whack, whack) the
first two hits, one hits in the side, and you can

2550
03:11:17,431 --> 03:11:21,895
see it (grunts) reacts. The second one, it brings
its shield up, and you splinter the buckler shield

2551
03:11:21,895 --> 03:11:26,742
on its arm, and as it shatters, you can see the
bones in its arm (crunch) crack from the impact,

2552
03:11:26,742 --> 03:11:30,852
and it drops its arm to one side, with the flames
itself beginning to set fire to the furs it has on

2553
03:11:30,852 --> 03:11:35,332
its arm. (grunts) He tries to shake off the fire
that's on its arm. As you see it bring its arm up,

2554
03:11:35,332 --> 03:11:40,391
it reveals the underside of its torso. You use
that to reach down, leap in the air with an

2555
03:11:40,391 --> 03:11:45,057
overhead swipe, slam this warhammer with all your
strength into the side of its ribcage. As you do,

2556
03:11:45,057 --> 03:11:51,459
(crack) you can see its torso cave in, and you're
probably sure that the splintered bones seem to

2557
03:11:51,459 --> 03:11:56,570
have impacted something serious as the giant all
of a sudden, (death rattle).

2558
03:11:56,570 --> 03:11:59,693
(cheering)

2559
03:11:59,693 --> 03:12:02,834
MARY: Dead? Dead!

2560
03:12:02,834 --> 03:12:06,545
MATT: From the damage left over from the battle
you had earlier, the damage it already took from

2561
03:12:06,545 --> 03:12:11,879
the dragon, and that was just enough to finish it
off by two hit points. That ends your turn, Grog.

2562
03:12:11,879 --> 03:12:13,474
Zahra, you're up.

2563
03:12:13,474 --> 03:12:15,269
MARY: How far away from the dragon am I?

2564
03:12:15,269 --> 03:12:18,086
MATT: You are 30 feet away.

2565
03:12:18,086 --> 03:12:22,101
MARY: That's exactly right, which means Witch Bolt
is still in effect, and I'm going to fucking

2566
03:12:22,101 --> 03:12:25,985
unleash on this white wyrm of death.

2567
03:12:25,985 --> 03:12:33,063
MATT: All right! (boof) A third time, now, you
release Witch Bolt. It slams into it. The dragon

2568
03:12:33,063 --> 03:12:34,715
actually tries to shift out of the way--

2569
03:12:34,715 --> 03:12:36,820
MARY: He can't.

2570
03:12:36,820 --> 03:12:38,646
MATT: He can't, because you're locked in.

2571
03:12:38,646 --> 03:12:40,433
MARY: You can't get away from me.

2572
03:12:40,433 --> 03:12:42,519
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

2573
03:12:42,519 --> 03:12:43,724
LAURA: Creepy Zahra!

2574
03:12:43,724 --> 03:12:51,358
MARY: Creepy Zahra. Well, I am a demon. All right.
11.

2575
03:12:51,358 --> 03:13:06,958
TRAVIS: 27. 39. 48. 1d6. 53.

2576
03:13:06,958 --> 03:13:08,029
MARY: 53.

2577
03:13:08,029 --> 03:13:09,304
FELICIA: Damn!

2578
03:13:09,304 --> 03:13:11,853
TRAVIS: You bad bitch!

2579
03:13:11,853 --> 03:13:17,360
MATT: All right, so. It tries to dodge out of the
way. This time, as you focus again, the yellowish

2580
03:13:17,360 --> 03:13:22,515
energy has now transitioned to a deep, hot,
searing red flame from your eyes.

2581
03:13:22,515 --> 03:13:24,692
MARY: Oh, you can't run!

2582
03:13:24,692 --> 03:13:29,887
MATT: (boof) You focus again. The beam now,
transitioning into a similar red-hot color,

2583
03:13:29,887 --> 03:13:33,834
streaks across and slams into the side of the
dragon. You can see the impact. The scales are

2584
03:13:33,834 --> 03:13:38,868
left with this glowing red heat from the blast,
and part of its armor is torn open. You can see

2585
03:13:38,868 --> 03:13:45,099
the burn-charred muscle beneath. The dragon's
looking pretty rough. Do you wish to move, or are

2586
03:13:45,099 --> 03:13:46,510
you staying right there?

2587
03:13:46,510 --> 03:13:49,994
MARY: I'm going to approach it by five feet.

2588
03:13:49,994 --> 03:13:56,058
MATT: There you go. That brings us to Scanlan's
turn. You are way over here.

2589
03:13:56,058 --> 03:14:01,475
SAM: I will first use my bonus action on myself.
Can I cast Healing Word on myself?

2590
03:14:01,475 --> 03:14:03,130
MATT: Yeah. Sure.

2591
03:14:03,130 --> 03:14:11,896
SAM: Okay, d4 plus five. That's nothing. Actually,
wait. Can I just take a potion as a bonus action?

2592
03:14:11,896 --> 03:14:13,465
MATT: If you want to, yeah.

2593
03:14:13,465 --> 03:14:16,835
SAM: Okay, I'll just do that. I'll take a greater
heal. 4d4 plus four.

2594
03:14:16,835 --> 03:14:18,017
MATT: All righty.

2595
03:14:18,017 --> 03:14:30,516
SAM: Anyway, I'll roll it later. Sorry. (counts
quietly) Plus four is 11. Okay, I'm pretty much

2596
03:14:30,516 --> 03:14:31,759
back up to--

2597
03:14:31,759 --> 03:14:35,404
MATT: There you go. Are you going to stay where
you are?

2598
03:14:35,404 --> 03:14:36,681
SAM: I'm how far?

2599
03:14:36,681 --> 03:14:37,968
MATT: You are over here.

2600
03:14:37,968 --> 03:14:39,243
SAM: But how far?

2601
03:14:39,243 --> 03:14:45,854
MATT: Oh. It's 90 feet away from you.

2602
03:14:45,854 --> 03:14:50,934
SAM: (whispering) Sniper shot. (louder) From the
shadows, I cast Lightning Bolt, which has a

2603
03:14:50,934 --> 03:14:52,728
hundred-foot range.

2604
03:14:52,728 --> 03:14:54,381
MATT: It does, and because it's high enough--

2605
03:14:54,381 --> 03:14:56,732
SAM: If the angle is nice and clean.

2606
03:14:56,732 --> 03:15:03,383
MATT: Yes, that's true. So out of the darkness,
release a bolt of energy. It's going to attempt to

2607
03:15:03,383 --> 03:15:06,069
make a saving throw. What's the DC on it?

2608
03:15:06,069 --> 03:15:08,980
SAM: It's my spell? What is it?

2609
03:15:08,980 --> 03:15:10,588
MATT: Yeah, it's whatever your spell DC is.

2610
03:15:10,588 --> 03:15:11,578
SAM: 17?

2611
03:15:11,578 --> 03:15:14,717
MATT: 17, okay. It does make its saving throw, so
it is half damage. Go ahead and roll. Rolled a 16

2612
03:15:14,717 --> 03:15:15,876
plus five.

2613
03:15:15,876 --> 03:15:18,529
SAM: It was 8d6, but now it's 4d6, right?

2614
03:15:18,529 --> 03:15:21,535
MATT: No, it's 8d6 still. You roll the total, and
it's halved.

2615
03:15:21,535 --> 03:15:33,941
SAM: All right, what is that? (counts quietly) 26.
13.

2616
03:15:33,941 --> 03:15:35,727
MATT: All right.

2617
03:15:35,727 --> 03:15:38,960
TRAVIS: Yes, dude. Way not to be dead.

2618
03:15:38,960 --> 03:15:42,494
FELICIA: Way to not die.

2619
03:15:42,494 --> 03:15:46,055
TRAVIS: I need my whoring partner.

2620
03:15:46,055 --> 03:15:52,896
MATT: All right, at the end of your turn, it's
going to use one of its legendary actions to make

2621
03:15:52,896 --> 03:15:58,972
a tail attack and reach over the side here at
Percy, who's trying to stay hidden there. Brings

2622
03:15:58,972 --> 03:16:05,755
around his tail. (whoosh) Comes swinging down over
the side. Another natural 20.

2623
03:16:05,755 --> 03:16:08,087
(groaning)

2624
03:16:08,087 --> 03:16:09,231
FELICIA: He looks disappointed.

2625
03:16:09,231 --> 03:16:11,297
LAURA: He doesn't want us to die.

2626
03:16:11,297 --> 03:16:13,134
FELICIA: It's going to happen.

2627
03:16:13,134 --> 03:16:15,722
MARY: No! Would you stop it, Lyra? Come on!

2628
03:16:15,722 --> 03:16:18,527
FELICIA: I'm sorry. I have self-esteem issues.

2629
03:16:18,527 --> 03:16:20,466
MARY: Not today, you don't.

2630
03:16:20,466 --> 03:16:25,578
MATT: 32 points of bludgeoning damage to you,
Percy. (whack) From over the top.

2631
03:16:25,578 --> 03:16:27,204
TALIESIN: I'm out.

2632
03:16:27,204 --> 03:16:32,492
MATT: Percy is down as the tail (whack) slams him
down. You can see now, as the tail pulls back, the

2633
03:16:32,492 --> 03:16:37,055
ice on the ground is slightly concave. There's
pieces of ice that have shattered and jutted up

2634
03:16:37,055 --> 03:16:42,737
from the impact. As the tail pulls away, dropping
chunks of stone and ice, you can see a

2635
03:16:42,737 --> 03:16:47,553
currently unconscious Percy is now face-down and
pushed probably a good half-foot into the ground

2636
03:16:47,553 --> 03:16:51,097
itself. Your face is a mess, if they ever pull you
up from that right now.

2637
03:16:51,097 --> 03:16:53,405
TALIESIN: I like my face.

2638
03:16:53,405 --> 03:17:02,381
MATT: That ends Scanlan's turn. The giant is dead.
There are no giants; they're gone. Lyra, you're

2639
03:17:02,381 --> 03:17:03,236
up.

2640
03:17:03,236 --> 03:17:04,769
FELICIA: Okay, I can Fireball him now.

2641
03:17:04,769 --> 03:17:06,465
(cheering)

2642
03:17:06,465 --> 03:17:15,623
FELICIA: Fireball. Ooh, that looks pretty good!
Six and six and six.

2643
03:17:15,623 --> 03:17:17,980
LAURA: Come on, Lyra. Killing blow.

2644
03:17:17,980 --> 03:17:20,430
TRAVIS: Nuke him. Nuke the bastard.

2645
03:17:20,430 --> 03:17:33,093
FELICIA: So that's 18, 28, 38, 52. 52 points of
damage.

2646
03:17:33,093 --> 03:17:35,390
MATT: 52 points? And what's the DC on your spell?

2647
03:17:35,390 --> 03:17:36,703
FELICIA: It's no DC. It just hits.

2648
03:17:36,703 --> 03:17:38,214
MATT: Right, but it has a save.

2649
03:17:38,214 --> 03:17:39,091
FELICIA: 17.

2650
03:17:39,091 --> 03:17:43,279
MATT: 17. Okay, it rolled a 15 plus five, so it is
half damage, but that's still 26 points of damage

2651
03:17:43,279 --> 03:17:44,152
to it.

2652
03:17:44,152 --> 03:17:45,297
FELICIA: It's not bad.

2653
03:17:45,297 --> 03:17:52,047
MATT: (explosion noise) As you reach out, this
arcing bead of red streaks through the darkness,

2654
03:17:52,047 --> 03:17:56,975
impacts right at the side of the dragon's wing,
and then (boof) bursts into a giant ball of flame.

2655
03:17:56,975 --> 03:18:02,417
The whole cavern rocks from the sound of the
impact. As the dragon pulls back, you can see this

2656
03:18:02,417 --> 03:18:06,529
giant char mark on the outside of its wing. It's
looking pretty rough. It's still standing, but

2657
03:18:06,529 --> 03:18:10,186
it's looking pretty rough. Unfortunately, the
radius of the blast, as it is a 20-foot radius, is

2658
03:18:10,186 --> 03:18:16,409
large enough. Percy, his body is hit in the impact
and blasted onto its back now. He rolls partly out

2659
03:18:16,409 --> 03:18:17,522
of the impact--

2660
03:18:17,522 --> 03:18:18,849
TALIESIN: Do I actually roll?

2661
03:18:18,849 --> 03:18:23,285
MATT: You actually (boof) over there. You're still
technically in the same spot, but you're on your

2662
03:18:23,285 --> 03:18:27,495
back now. You do automatically fail a death saving
throw from that.

2663
03:18:27,495 --> 03:18:30,657
FELICIA: Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

2664
03:18:30,657 --> 03:18:40,835
MATT: All right, that ends Lyra's turn. That
brings us to the top. Percy. Make a saving throw.

2665
03:18:40,835 --> 03:18:43,233
Just roll a ten or higher.

2666
03:18:43,233 --> 03:18:46,382
TALIESIN: I did not roll a ten or higher.

2667
03:18:46,382 --> 03:18:48,203
MATT: You fail a second death saving throw.

2668
03:18:48,203 --> 03:18:50,051
SAM: Oh god!

2669
03:18:50,051 --> 03:18:54,719
MATT: Vex, you're up.

2670
03:18:54,719 --> 03:19:04,654
LAURA: (screams) Okay, here's the thing. Did he
roll far enough away that he is not within ten

2671
03:19:04,654 --> 03:19:06,157
feet of the dragon?

2672
03:19:06,157 --> 03:19:07,867
MATT: The dragon is ten feet up.

2673
03:19:07,867 --> 03:19:09,308
LAURA: So he's far enough away.

2674
03:19:09,308 --> 03:19:13,737
MATT: In theory, he'd be just out of the way of a
ten-foot radius. A 20-foot radius, no.

2675
03:19:13,737 --> 03:19:20,332
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to Lightning Arrow the
dragon.

2676
03:19:20,332 --> 03:19:21,730
MATT: Okay.

2677
03:19:21,730 --> 03:19:24,451
FELICIA: Do you have a potion?

2678
03:19:24,451 --> 03:19:25,653
TRAVIS: I do.

2679
03:19:25,653 --> 03:19:27,152
TALIESIN: Grog's got it.

2680
03:19:27,152 --> 03:19:33,398
LAURA: Do I have to attack? I do have to attack
regular.

2681
03:19:33,398 --> 03:19:35,189
MATT: You do have to roll the attack, yes.

2682
03:19:35,189 --> 03:19:37,519
LAURA: That's good. That's a 29.

2683
03:19:37,519 --> 03:19:38,631
MATT: 29 hits.

2684
03:19:38,631 --> 03:19:43,568
LAURA: Okay, so that is 4d8 against the dragon.

2685
03:19:43,568 --> 03:19:49,538
MATT: Yeah, 4d8 lightning damage. What's the DC on
it?

2686
03:19:49,538 --> 03:19:51,905
LAURA: 14.

2687
03:19:51,905 --> 03:19:55,355
MATT: 14? It does not make the save. Rolled a
three.

2688
03:19:55,355 --> 03:20:03,960
SAM: Come on, Vex. Come on. Do it for Trinket.

2689
03:20:03,960 --> 03:20:08,267
TRAVIS: Do it for Percy. Do it for Pike.

2690
03:20:08,267 --> 03:20:11,176
TALIESIN: Let's not have another Pike, please.

2691
03:20:11,176 --> 03:20:16,333
LAURA: 17.

2692
03:20:16,333 --> 03:20:18,975
MATT: Plus your Hunter's Mark.

2693
03:20:18,975 --> 03:20:27,765
LAURA: That's good. That's another six for
Hunter's Mark. Plus another 11.

2694
03:20:27,765 --> 03:20:32,114
MATT: Plus another 11. Okay. As the arrow
releases, once again, (arrow flying) it turns into

2695
03:20:32,114 --> 03:20:36,481
a bolt of pure arcane energy, smacking into the
side of it. You can see the explosion hit and the

2696
03:20:36,481 --> 03:20:40,245
energy crackle through the rest of its body. Its
muscles shudder and it has to grasp the side of

2697
03:20:40,245 --> 03:20:45,685
the top of this platform to keep itself steady.
You can see now, the dragon's (heavy breathing).

2698
03:20:45,685 --> 03:20:50,655
One eye is partially closed, and with each breath
you can see this frost mist emanating from its

2699
03:20:50,655 --> 03:20:52,775
breath. It looks like it's on its last legs.

2700
03:20:52,775 --> 03:20:54,359
LAURA: For my second attack--

2701
03:20:54,359 --> 03:20:57,510
(cheering)

2702
03:20:57,510 --> 03:21:06,252
LAURA: For my second attack, I'm going to regular
attack him. Oh my god. Just going to regular

2703
03:21:06,252 --> 03:21:07,346
attack him.

2704
03:21:07,346 --> 03:21:08,458
MATT: Roll for attack.

2705
03:21:08,458 --> 03:21:13,078
LAURA: Jesus. Please. Oh! It's 30.

2706
03:21:13,078 --> 03:21:16,432
MATT: 30 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2707
03:21:16,432 --> 03:21:22,522
LAURA: 13, 14, 15.

2708
03:21:22,522 --> 03:21:24,670
MATT: Including the Hunter's Mark?

2709
03:21:24,670 --> 03:21:29,169
LAURA: No! Four.

2710
03:21:29,169 --> 03:21:35,842
MATT: Okay, so 19 total? Okay. As the arrow (arrow
flying, impacts) embeds itself in the side of the

2711
03:21:35,842 --> 03:21:40,529
neck, the dragon reaches up and it's scratching at
the pain. As it pulls the arrow out, blood begins

2712
03:21:40,529 --> 03:21:42,038
to pour down its side.

2713
03:21:42,038 --> 03:21:44,260
LAURA: Ugh, he's still alive!

2714
03:21:44,260 --> 03:21:48,869
MATT: It's rough. That ends your turn.

2715
03:21:48,869 --> 03:21:54,958
LAURA: Fuck! Is it his turn?

2716
03:21:54,958 --> 03:22:06,487
MATT: It is now Rimefang's turn. Rimefang turns.
(heavy breaths, roars) and lets out a spray of icy

2717
03:22:06,487 --> 03:22:13,377
damage out in this direction at an arc this way. I
need to get a dexterity saving throw from Lyra,

2718
03:22:13,377 --> 03:22:16,200
from Vex, and from Zahra.

2719
03:22:16,200 --> 03:22:17,918
MARY: Do I have a reaction?

2720
03:22:17,918 --> 03:22:19,527
MATT: After this, you will.

2721
03:22:19,527 --> 03:22:22,548
MARY: Okay, got it.

2722
03:22:22,548 --> 03:22:23,580
FELICIA: Eight.

2723
03:22:23,580 --> 03:22:24,488
MATT: Eight?

2724
03:22:24,488 --> 03:22:25,808
LAURA: 28.

2725
03:22:25,808 --> 03:22:27,859
MATT: 28. Okay. Zahra?

2726
03:22:27,859 --> 03:22:29,308
MARY: 11.

2727
03:22:29,308 --> 03:22:33,863
MATT: 11. Okay, so that is 54 points of damage to
you.

2728
03:22:33,863 --> 03:22:35,266
FELICIA: I'm down.

2729
03:22:35,266 --> 03:22:41,716
MATT: Lyra is currently (crackles) frozen in
place right now from the blast. She's unconscious,

2730
03:22:41,716 --> 03:22:45,980
and there is a coat of ice around her body holding
her in place. How are you doing on hit points?

2731
03:22:45,980 --> 03:22:48,480
LAURA: I'm at 28 hit points.

2732
03:22:48,480 --> 03:22:54,344
MATT: Okay, you kick the frost off, and you're on
one knee. And you take 54 points of ice damage.

2733
03:22:54,344 --> 03:22:55,900
LAURA: Are you unconscious, too?

2734
03:22:55,900 --> 03:22:58,330
MARY: Nope. I'm not. Do I have a reaction?

2735
03:22:58,330 --> 03:22:59,566
MATT: You have a reaction?

2736
03:22:59,566 --> 03:23:01,634
MARY: I do, I use Hellish Rebuke.

2737
03:23:01,634 --> 03:23:05,128
SAM: Oh! What is that? It sounds hellish.

2738
03:23:05,128 --> 03:23:07,549
MARY: I know. I get one per day.

2739
03:23:07,549 --> 03:23:11,372
MATT: All right, so the creature must make a
dexterity saving throw.

2740
03:23:11,372 --> 03:23:12,879
LAURA: So it does it back to him?

2741
03:23:12,879 --> 03:23:14,159
MARY: Yes.

2742
03:23:14,159 --> 03:23:16,110
MATT: That is 15. What's the DC?

2743
03:23:16,110 --> 03:23:17,732
MARY: I don't know.

2744
03:23:17,732 --> 03:23:18,701
LAURA: 17.

2745
03:23:18,701 --> 03:23:19,734
MARY: 17.

2746
03:23:19,734 --> 03:23:24,832
MATT: Okay, so it takes 2d10 fire damage. Go ahead
and roll that.

2747
03:23:24,832 --> 03:23:27,847
LAURA: Yes! Oh my god, you can kill it just
because it attacked you?!

2748
03:23:27,847 --> 03:23:30,568
TALIESIN: Kill it out of spite.

2749
03:23:30,568 --> 03:23:33,744
FELICIA: Tell him he's very ugly.

2750
03:23:33,744 --> 03:23:35,955
MARY: Nine.

2751
03:23:35,955 --> 03:23:37,723
MATT: Nine points of fire damage?

2752
03:23:37,723 --> 03:23:39,120
How do you want to do this?

2753
03:23:39,120 --> 03:23:41,929
(cheering)

2754
03:23:41,929 --> 03:23:45,123
MARY: I don't know what that means!

2755
03:23:45,123 --> 03:23:49,751
MATT: How do you finish this dragon with your
Hellish Rebuke?

2756
03:23:49,751 --> 03:23:52,076
TALIESIN: Make it good!

2757
03:23:52,076 --> 03:23:59,581
MATT: After it finishes blasting you with ice
damage, you watch the wizard frozen in place. You

2758
03:23:59,581 --> 03:24:04,263
see Percy unconscious and bleeding on the ground.
You see Vex on the ground, about to fall

2759
03:24:04,263 --> 03:24:09,425
unconscious. Your friends are lost in the darkness
around you, and suddenly you feel that tiefling

2760
03:24:09,425 --> 03:24:11,754
surge of anger within you, and you?

2761
03:24:11,754 --> 03:24:18,914
MARY: Almost completely turn into flame as I walk
towards it. Can I use anything?

2762
03:24:18,914 --> 03:24:22,304
MATT: How do you want the Hellish Rebuke to be?

2763
03:24:22,304 --> 03:24:30,243
MARY: I want this Hellish Rebuke to be me
levitating in the air and using my dark dragon

2764
03:24:30,243 --> 03:24:41,822
staff to blast it from here down, just
eviscerating everything from the bowels down with

2765
03:24:41,822 --> 03:24:43,275
hellish fire.

2766
03:24:43,275 --> 03:24:47,800
MATT: So after the frost takes on the front of
you, and there is ice caked against the front of

2767
03:24:47,800 --> 03:24:52,389
your armor, you suddenly look up at it and as your
eyes flare with flame, the ice (shatters)

2768
03:24:52,389 --> 03:24:56,102
evaporates from the sheer heat your body's
emanating. You take a step forward, but the step

2769
03:24:56,102 --> 03:25:00,335
itself is about an inch off the ground. A second
step, you're two inches off the ground. And with

2770
03:25:00,335 --> 03:25:04,243
each progressive step, you're slowly floating in
the air, the warlock energy now swirling around

2771
03:25:04,243 --> 03:25:08,000
you. The shadows are spinning around you and
coalescing around your feet. As you look forward

2772
03:25:08,000 --> 03:25:12,266
towards it, you see the portion of its armor that
was blasted open earlier, with its flesh and sinew

2773
03:25:12,266 --> 03:25:18,225
exposed. You take the staff forward, and with an
angry snarl, the one last blast of infernal

2774
03:25:18,225 --> 03:25:23,273
energy, the Hellish Rebuke then (shooting sound)
sinking into the side of its chest. As the inside

2775
03:25:23,273 --> 03:25:28,587
of its flesh begins to spark and smoke, the dragon
(grunts) reaches out and grabs the side. It's

2776
03:25:28,587 --> 03:25:32,983
beginning to try to bring its wings up to fly
away, and as it does, (explosion noise) a blast of

2777
03:25:32,983 --> 03:25:38,035
infernal flame comes cascading out of its chest.
You can see now, all of its armor begins to peel

2778
03:25:38,035 --> 03:25:46,134
back as its chest is blown open. Its eyes
suddenly go from this piercing blue-white to a

2779
03:25:46,134 --> 03:25:53,669
dull gray color, and it reaches out, and (heavy
breathing) "No." It tumbles forward onto the

2780
03:25:53,669 --> 03:25:59,903
ground next to Percy, almost crushing his
unconscious form. It gets up, (impacts) takes two

2781
03:25:59,903 --> 03:26:03,875
more steps forward. "No. You can't."

2782
03:26:03,875 --> 03:26:08,292
MARY: Yes, I fucking can!

2783
03:26:08,292 --> 03:26:11,642
(cheering)

2784
03:26:11,642 --> 03:26:14,178
MATT: And with that, Rimefang falls dead to the
ground.

2785
03:26:14,178 --> 03:26:18,271
(cheering)

2786
03:26:18,271 --> 03:26:30,229
SAM: I run over to Lyra, cast Seeming on myself to
give myself the appearance of Aldor, and I pour a

2787
03:26:30,229 --> 03:26:34,494
potion into her mouth, and I wake her up.

2788
03:26:34,494 --> 03:26:36,243
FELICIA: What happened?

2789
03:26:36,243 --> 03:26:37,723
SAM: You did good, baby.

2790
03:26:37,723 --> 03:26:39,499
FELICIA: (gasps) And I'm just in him.

2791
03:26:39,499 --> 03:26:44,490
(laughter)

2792
03:26:44,490 --> 03:26:49,437
TRAVIS: I run over to Percy and pour a healing
potion in his mouth, and I don't "in him."

2793
03:26:49,437 --> 03:26:51,995
(laughter)

2794
03:26:51,995 --> 03:26:55,013
MATT: You can just barely get there with your
movement. Thank god you're a barbarian.

2795
03:26:55,013 --> 03:27:01,636
TALIESIN: Oh! What happened? Oh, look. It's dead!

2796
03:27:01,636 --> 03:27:02,976
MARY: Hello, Percy.

2797
03:27:02,976 --> 03:27:06,311
LAURA: Oh my god. I stand up and I give Zahra a
giant hug.

2798
03:27:06,311 --> 03:27:09,263
TALIESIN: Can we cut that bastard up for scrap
now? Ugh.

2799
03:27:09,263 --> 03:27:11,068
LAURA: You were amazing.

2800
03:27:11,068 --> 03:27:12,610
MARY: Forever besties?

2801
03:27:12,610 --> 03:27:17,787
FELICIA: Wait, then I notice. Aldor, why are you
so short?

2802
03:27:17,787 --> 03:27:28,938
SAM: Baby. I can't change height, so I release
Seeming and I'm back to normal.

2803
03:27:28,938 --> 03:27:35,918
FELICIA: That was not as good a kiss as usual. I
was worried, but it was special.

2804
03:27:35,918 --> 03:27:36,915
TRAVIS: Oh!

2805
03:27:36,915 --> 03:27:40,911
(laughter)

2806
03:27:40,911 --> 03:27:45,664
MARY: Is it time to take what we need from this
thing?

2807
03:27:45,664 --> 03:27:48,417
LAURA: Gather up all of the shit we have to take
and put it in the bag of stuff.

2808
03:27:48,417 --> 03:27:53,018
TALIESIN: That would be: two white dragon eyes,
one white dragon tongue, one white dragon heart,

2809
03:27:53,018 --> 03:27:56,680
six white dragon claws, and 20 white dragon
teeth.

2810
03:27:56,680 --> 03:27:58,218
MATT: Who's harvesting this?

2811
03:27:58,218 --> 03:27:59,886
MARY: You have the bag.

2812
03:27:59,886 --> 03:28:02,110
FELICIA: It's nature. Who has good animal
handling?

2813
03:28:02,110 --> 03:28:03,828
LAURA: Wait, we have to harvest it special?

2814
03:28:03,828 --> 03:28:07,721
MATT: Part of harvesting the organs from the
creature is a delicate process.

2815
03:28:07,721 --> 03:28:09,287
LAURA: Is it nature? What is it a check for?

2816
03:28:09,287 --> 03:28:10,514
MATT: It's a nature-based check, yes.

2817
03:28:10,514 --> 03:28:11,882
LAURA: I have a low nature. What do you have?

2818
03:28:11,882 --> 03:28:13,079
TALIESIN: Very low nature.

2819
03:28:13,079 --> 03:28:16,866
MARY: I have a six nature. Can I harvest him?

2820
03:28:16,866 --> 03:28:17,966
MATT: You can.

2821
03:28:17,966 --> 03:28:19,738
TRAVIS: Can I go and loot the giant that's not
frozen?

2822
03:28:19,738 --> 03:28:22,315
MATT: You can. You can also help with this roll.

2823
03:28:22,315 --> 03:28:28,035
SAM: Inspiration? Okay. I inspire them.

2824
03:28:28,035 --> 03:28:31,533
MATT: How do you inspire Zahra as she goes to
start carving into this dragon?

2825
03:28:31,533 --> 03:28:40,022
SAM: I will sing something. I don't know what. I'm
so out of it. We just killed a dragon!

2826
03:28:40,022 --> 03:28:42,323
(laughter)

2827
03:28:42,323 --> 03:28:49,759
SAM: I go over to her and I'm like, (incoherent,
impressed stammering). And that's all I got.

2828
03:28:49,759 --> 03:28:52,114
MATT: And with that, you killed a dragon.

2829
03:28:52,114 --> 03:28:54,280
MARY: It was a group effort.

2830
03:28:54,280 --> 03:28:57,601
LAURA: Can I help at all? Can I assist? Can I hold
her utensils for her?

2831
03:28:57,601 --> 03:29:01,631
MATT: Between the two of you working together,
that would give you advantage on the checks. Which

2832
03:29:01,631 --> 03:29:06,936
one are you going for first? Are you going for the
eyes? Choose which portion you're harvesting

2833
03:29:06,936 --> 03:29:08,028
first.

2834
03:29:08,028 --> 03:29:11,684
LAURA: Everything. We need all of it, don't we?

2835
03:29:11,684 --> 03:29:14,930
MATT: Yeah, but which part are you harvesting
first? You choose with each roll. You have eyes,

2836
03:29:14,930 --> 03:29:15,928
heart--

2837
03:29:15,928 --> 03:29:17,500
FELICIA: Can I assist? Can I help?

2838
03:29:17,500 --> 03:29:18,970
MATT: We already have an assist over there.

2839
03:29:18,970 --> 03:29:20,785
FELICIA: I want to be helpful.

2840
03:29:20,785 --> 03:29:22,643
LAURA: We'll all stand and watch.

2841
03:29:22,643 --> 03:29:25,645
TALIESIN: Start with the eyes.

2842
03:29:25,645 --> 03:29:30,646
LAURA: Pop them out. Pop those bitches out. But
you get an advantage.

2843
03:29:30,646 --> 03:29:33,647
MATT: You will get advantage on it because she's
assisting you.

2844
03:29:33,647 --> 03:29:35,379
MARY: That's nine plus--

2845
03:29:35,379 --> 03:29:37,928
LAURA: Yeah, that's 15 plus six is 21.

2846
03:29:37,928 --> 03:29:45,253
MATT: 21. Okay. As you come over, using a dagger
that you have. Pop very delicately each dragon eye

2847
03:29:45,253 --> 03:29:46,878
out and place it into the satchel.

2848
03:29:46,878 --> 03:29:48,428
LAURA: Into the cooler bag.

2849
03:29:48,428 --> 03:29:54,134
MATT: As you pull each eye out, it's like holding
the coldest orb you've ever held. It actually

2850
03:29:54,134 --> 03:29:59,517
burns your fingers as you clutch it. (gasp) Throw
it inside and have to shake your hand off.

2851
03:29:59,517 --> 03:30:02,424
LAURA: I jiggle them around in the bag. Just
because.

2852
03:30:02,424 --> 03:30:04,510
FELICIA: We have a special crate?

2853
03:30:04,510 --> 03:30:05,554
LAURA: Yeah, I'm holding it.

2854
03:30:05,554 --> 03:30:08,319
TALIESIN: The tongue would be next.

2855
03:30:08,319 --> 03:30:10,967
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for that.

2856
03:30:10,967 --> 03:30:17,564
LAURA: Plus another roll for advantage. Ooh,
that's way better. Plus six. 23.

2857
03:30:17,564 --> 03:30:22,974
MATT: 23, all right. So you manage to, with the
help of Vex pulling the jaw open, Grog holding

2858
03:30:22,974 --> 03:30:32,062
onto the side, Lyra's supervising. You manage to
get to the base of the tongue, carve off-- And you

2859
03:30:32,062 --> 03:30:38,929
(slurp-pop) pull out the rather massive, very
heavy tongue-- which, once again, this in itself,

2860
03:30:38,929 --> 03:30:44,037
is like (yelps). Put it in real fast. And in the
process of doing so, you suffer two points of cold

2861
03:30:44,037 --> 03:30:47,512
damage, but the tongue has been harvested.

2862
03:30:47,512 --> 03:30:48,953
TALIESIN: A heart.

2863
03:30:48,953 --> 03:30:53,487
MATT: This one's going to be difficult. Part of
the chest is blown open, exposing the interior,

2864
03:30:53,487 --> 03:30:57,410
but there has been damage done to the inside, so
go ahead and attempt this.

2865
03:30:57,410 --> 03:30:58,807
TRAVIS: Two rolls.

2866
03:30:58,807 --> 03:31:05,931
MARY: 12. 14. Plus six is 20.

2867
03:31:05,931 --> 03:31:12,191
MATT: Oh, 20! 20 is just what you needed. You pry
in and crack open a portion of its body, and you

2868
03:31:12,191 --> 03:31:17,197
begin to slowly carve out the portion, the heart,
and the dragon heart itself is massive. It's huge,

2869
03:31:17,197 --> 03:31:19,074
and it takes three of you to pull it out.

2870
03:31:19,074 --> 03:31:22,560
LAURA: How do we fit it in this bag? Is it magic?

2871
03:31:22,560 --> 03:31:25,436
MATT: You don't know, but it's not going to fit in
that satchel.

2872
03:31:25,436 --> 03:31:26,565
MARY: How heavy is it?

2873
03:31:26,565 --> 03:31:29,431
MATT: I'd say it probably weighs a good 200
pounds.

2874
03:31:29,431 --> 03:31:35,053
FELICIA: I should know what people would do in the
guild situation if they had an organ that wouldn't

2875
03:31:35,053 --> 03:31:36,798
fit in the bag, right? We have to preserve it.

2876
03:31:36,798 --> 03:31:41,327
MATT: Travel back quickly or have preservation
magic. Whether it would be a necromancy-based

2877
03:31:41,327 --> 03:31:42,312
magic.

2878
03:31:42,312 --> 03:31:43,333
FELICIA: Nope.

2879
03:31:43,333 --> 03:31:47,995
TRAVIS: We're not shoving it in there? Are we
cutting it in half?

2880
03:31:47,995 --> 03:31:53,627
LAURA: We could roll it up in one of our fancy
robes, though, and hold on to it. And pack it in--

2881
03:31:53,627 --> 03:31:56,495
oh, we, yeah! Let's chisel out some of the ice.

2882
03:31:56,495 --> 03:32:01,457
MATT: As you begin to wrap it up, you notice that
the cold air begins to (cracking) crack around it,

2883
03:32:01,457 --> 03:32:07,662
and the heart itself is freezing, as per the
nature of a freshly dead white dragon. So it might

2884
03:32:07,662 --> 03:32:10,887
be a good thing.

2885
03:32:10,887 --> 03:32:13,151
LAURA: What about all this gold in the cavern?

2886
03:32:13,151 --> 03:32:16,554
TALIESIN: Claws and teeth.

2887
03:32:16,554 --> 03:32:27,204
MARY: Teeth. Yes, roll to carve. Seven. 13.

2888
03:32:27,204 --> 03:32:33,974
MATT: 13. Going through the jaw, you begin
plucking teeth out, piece by piece (cling, cling)

2889
03:32:33,974 --> 03:32:39,290
and most of them, you notice, as part of the
nature of the body, are beginning to decay faster

2890
03:32:39,290 --> 03:32:42,975
than you expected. A lot of the teeth are becoming
brittle and breaking, and as you start pulling

2891
03:32:42,975 --> 03:32:45,828
them out, you're frustrated because with each one
it seems to almost shatter as soon as you claw it

2892
03:32:45,828 --> 03:32:51,099
from the jaw. By the end of it, you manage to
gather about three dragon's teeth before the rest

2893
03:32:51,099 --> 03:32:52,414
of them begin to break.

2894
03:32:52,414 --> 03:32:54,156
TRAVIS: We have a shitload of dragon teeth left
over.

2895
03:32:54,156 --> 03:32:55,832
LAURA: But we need white dragon.

2896
03:32:55,832 --> 03:32:57,417
TRAVIS: He was a white dragon!

2897
03:32:57,417 --> 03:33:00,720
LAURA: Or wait, are you sure it wasn't the blue
dragon that we harvested?

2898
03:33:00,720 --> 03:33:02,675
TRAVIS: No, it was a white dragon, we have 37 left
over.

2899
03:33:02,675 --> 03:33:05,077
LAURA: Okay. We have 37 dragon teeth from the
first white dragon.

2900
03:33:05,077 --> 03:33:09,527
MARY: Can I also get-- if there's any powder left
or anything, for myself, I would like to--

2901
03:33:09,527 --> 03:33:13,067
TALIESIN: Claws, still. We have to get claws
still.

2902
03:33:13,067 --> 03:33:19,406
MARY: I know, but if it's on the ground, and it's
in front of me, I would just like to put it in my

2903
03:33:19,406 --> 03:33:22,037
little bag, to have it for my own spellcasting.

2904
03:33:22,037 --> 03:33:29,239
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a nature roll for
that. Roll two more nature checks, or one more

2905
03:33:29,239 --> 03:33:30,509
check, with advantage.

2906
03:33:30,509 --> 03:33:32,180
LAURA: Another one.

2907
03:33:32,180 --> 03:33:34,317
MARY: That sucks, too. 13.

2908
03:33:34,317 --> 03:33:38,767
MATT: Okay. You managed to pull out some of the
more sensitive parts of the dragon, but as you

2909
03:33:38,767 --> 03:33:41,355
begin to cut away at some of the scales-- you're
going for the scales or the claws?

2910
03:33:41,355 --> 03:33:45,190
MARY: I was going for the powdered-- the remains
of whatever teeth that we couldn't get.

2911
03:33:45,190 --> 03:33:49,186
MATT: Oh, that! Never mind then, sorry. So then,
that you can gather without a problem. It's

2912
03:33:49,186 --> 03:33:55,953
powdered dragon ice bone, so yeah, that's fine.
All right.

2913
03:33:55,953 --> 03:33:57,502
TALIESIN: We still need claws.

2914
03:33:57,502 --> 03:33:59,008
LAURA: Let's go for claws.

2915
03:33:59,008 --> 03:34:02,709
TRAVIS: One more.

2916
03:34:02,709 --> 03:34:08,406
MARY: Nine. 15.

2917
03:34:08,406 --> 03:34:16,367
MATT: 15? In beginning to pull out the portions of
its hands and getting the base of where the claw

2918
03:34:16,367 --> 03:34:21,737
itself begins to grow, you manage to pull out five
functional dragon claws without them breaking.

2919
03:34:21,737 --> 03:34:23,546
MARY: How many did we need, Percy?

2920
03:34:23,546 --> 03:34:25,387
TALIESIN: Six. Do we have an extra? We have one?

2921
03:34:25,387 --> 03:34:27,426
MATT: You guys, prepared with your bag.

2922
03:34:27,426 --> 03:34:29,345
MARY: Hello! Prepared people!

2923
03:34:29,345 --> 03:34:31,709
TRAVIS: Oh, I looted the giant.

2924
03:34:31,709 --> 03:34:33,637
MATT: All right, you looted the giant.

2925
03:34:33,637 --> 03:34:35,367
MARY: Now can we get some scales?

2926
03:34:35,367 --> 03:34:38,819
LAURA: Just her? All of us?

2927
03:34:38,819 --> 03:34:41,413
MATT: All of you working together to get scales.

2928
03:34:41,413 --> 03:34:43,696
FELICIA: All of us? Free for all?

2929
03:34:43,696 --> 03:34:46,090
MATT: Well, this is the roll they're making for
it.

2930
03:34:46,090 --> 03:34:47,245
LAURA: 20 for scales.

2931
03:34:47,245 --> 03:34:50,896
MATT: 20 for scales, okay. So all of you working
together, you manage to pull off what amounts to

2932
03:34:50,896 --> 03:34:56,912
about 25 pounds of dragon scales. Mind you, the
scales are heavy and they're about that big each.

2933
03:34:56,912 --> 03:35:03,028
It would be enough if you were to bring it to a
master craftsman, to possibly construct a set of

2934
03:35:03,028 --> 03:35:04,349
armor from them.

2935
03:35:04,349 --> 03:35:08,575
LAURA: That's why we have so many pounds of dragon
scales from the previous dragons! We could make

2936
03:35:08,575 --> 03:35:10,560
three sets of armor right now.

2937
03:35:10,560 --> 03:35:14,237
FELICIA: I'm going to look around and just see if
there's a stash or a hoard that he was gathering.

2938
03:35:14,237 --> 03:35:20,208
MATT: All right, there are individual gold pieces
embedded all through. It would take you weeks to

2939
03:35:20,208 --> 03:35:21,532
chisel it all from the walls.

2940
03:35:21,532 --> 03:35:23,151
MARY: Are there any giant gems that we can see?

2941
03:35:23,151 --> 03:35:24,795
MATT: Everyone make a perception check.

2942
03:35:24,795 --> 03:35:26,891
LAURA: I want to get my diamond back, too, from
earlier.

2943
03:35:26,891 --> 03:35:28,761
TRAVIS: Can I loot the bloody giant?

2944
03:35:28,761 --> 03:35:32,011
LAURA: Natural 20 for perception! Ooh! Sparklies!

2945
03:35:32,011 --> 03:35:39,965
MATT: All right. So Grog. You go over to the giant
that's not frozen. Looking at it, most of its

2946
03:35:39,965 --> 03:35:44,046
armor itself is made for a giant's form, much
larger than anything else, and a lot of it has

2947
03:35:44,046 --> 03:35:48,779
been shredded by the dragon, or frozen and broken
from the impact and you, cutting it apart with its

2948
03:35:48,779 --> 03:35:54,097
axe. For the most part, all you're able to find
off of its body are approximately 120 gold pieces,

2949
03:35:54,097 --> 03:35:58,805
which isn't bad. Giants don't really carry a
lot of money on them, usually what they carry on

2950
03:35:58,805 --> 03:36:05,262
them is just trophies from battles they fought
previously. At least, these ones here. What did

2951
03:36:05,262 --> 03:36:06,508
you roll for perception?

2952
03:36:06,508 --> 03:36:07,965
TALIESIN: 16.

2953
03:36:07,965 --> 03:36:08,907
FELICIA: 18.

2954
03:36:08,907 --> 03:36:09,861
SAM: 11.

2955
03:36:09,861 --> 03:36:10,724
MARY: 13.

2956
03:36:10,724 --> 03:36:11,959
LAURA: Natural 20.

2957
03:36:11,959 --> 03:36:17,694
MATT: So as you guys are looking around, the
cavern seems to be fairly barren. You, however,

2958
03:36:17,694 --> 03:36:20,820
Vex, as you walk to the back of the cavern, you
see there are other pieces of partially eaten

2959
03:36:20,820 --> 03:36:25,863
frozen bodies. And you, using a little bit of
torchlight you can pull out, and glancing

2960
03:36:25,863 --> 03:36:30,451
underneath, you see a little bit of shining, more
of a cluster of shining about seven or eight

2961
03:36:30,451 --> 03:36:35,748
inches beneath the ice surface. And you look down
and you can see, there appears to be quite a hoard

2962
03:36:35,748 --> 03:36:39,987
of something frozen beneath the surface of this
cavern.

2963
03:36:39,987 --> 03:36:42,779
FELICIA: Oh I can help! (blasting sounds) I throw
a Fire Bolt.

2964
03:36:42,779 --> 03:36:45,311
MATT: (laughs) You start carving, you're like,
(yelps). Dodge out of the way just in time as

2965
03:36:45,311 --> 03:36:47,110
firebolts begin blasting the ice.

2966
03:36:47,110 --> 03:36:49,925
FELICIA: 14. 14 points of damage.

2967
03:36:49,925 --> 03:36:55,650
MATT: (boom boom) A large chunk of the ice is
blasted out from the Fire Bolt, and you catch your

2968
03:36:55,650 --> 03:36:58,996
breath for a second. It's not enough to get all
the way down, but it does manage to blast away a

2969
03:36:58,996 --> 03:37:00,117
large portion of the ice.

2970
03:37:00,117 --> 03:37:02,634
LAURA: I still have like two points of health,
FYI.

2971
03:37:02,634 --> 03:37:04,946
FELICIA: Oh! I'm sorry! You do look so lovely,
though.

2972
03:37:04,946 --> 03:37:09,770
MATT: And so between the two of you guys, you take
a dagger, you take your staff and you begin

2973
03:37:09,770 --> 03:37:12,706
jamming into the ice. You manage to break it
apart, and you do find beneath there, frozen,

2974
03:37:12,706 --> 03:37:18,672
quite a hoard. You find over the next hour or so,
4,244 gold pieces--

2975
03:37:18,672 --> 03:37:20,188
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Whoa!

2976
03:37:20,188 --> 03:37:21,226
LAURA: How much?

2977
03:37:21,226 --> 03:37:32,695
MATT: 4,244 gold pieces. A cluster of gems worth
around 850 gold. A singular diamond. It's about

2978
03:37:32,695 --> 03:37:38,297
that large. It's actually a little bit smaller
than the other one you have, but it's worth

2979
03:37:38,297 --> 03:37:48,262
anywhere in the neighborhood of 1,200 gold
pieces. You also manage to find a pair of leather

2980
03:37:48,262 --> 03:37:55,456
gloves with almost gold trim around each one of
the joints. You find what looks like a small

2981
03:37:55,456 --> 03:38:01,763
leather cap that you pull over the head, that a
peasant would wear, and what looks to be one glass

2982
03:38:01,763 --> 03:38:04,341
vial containing an indeterminate liquid.

2983
03:38:04,341 --> 03:38:06,780
LAURA: What is the color of the liquid?

2984
03:38:06,780 --> 03:38:08,824
MATT: From what you can look at the color, it's
like a purplish-blue.

2985
03:38:08,824 --> 03:38:12,924
MARY: Can anybody do a perception check on magical
liquid?

2986
03:38:12,924 --> 03:38:16,014
TRAVIS: I would like to perception check the
leather hat.

2987
03:38:16,014 --> 03:38:19,343
MATT: Make a perception check.

2988
03:38:19,343 --> 03:38:22,020
LAURA: Can anybody do an arcana check on the
leather hat?

2989
03:38:22,020 --> 03:38:24,073
MATT: Oh. Do you have Detect Magic?

2990
03:38:24,073 --> 03:38:25,254
TRAVIS: 16!

2991
03:38:25,254 --> 03:38:26,800
MATT: Or Identify spell?

2992
03:38:26,800 --> 03:38:29,507
FELICIA: No. I thought about them.

2993
03:38:29,507 --> 03:38:34,076
MATT: Okay. Make an arcana check. Well, you guys
have a brief rest here; it should be fine,

2994
03:38:34,076 --> 03:38:37,624
actually. Okay. Looking at it, this is a very
fancy leather hat.

2995
03:38:37,624 --> 03:38:41,734
TRAVIS: It's a fancy leather hat. It's mine.
Dibs!

2996
03:38:41,734 --> 03:38:43,315
TALIESIN: I'm curious about the gloves, myself.

2997
03:38:43,315 --> 03:38:46,630
MATT: You take some time with each one of these
items that you pull out from the ice, and each one

2998
03:38:46,630 --> 03:38:51,288
emanates a magical aura from them. You take the
gloves first and you look at them, and you

2999
03:38:51,288 --> 03:38:55,767
eventually come to realize, oh, you've heard about
this, you read about this in your books. These are

3000
03:38:55,767 --> 03:39:02,510
Gloves of Missile Snaring. They're gloves that
when worn, you have an opportunity to possibly

3001
03:39:02,510 --> 03:39:09,242
snatch a missile out of the air. These gloves seem
to almost meld into your hands when you don them. When

3002
03:39:09,242 --> 03:39:12,291
a ranged weapon attack hits you while you're
wearing them, you can use your reaction to reduce

3003
03:39:12,291 --> 03:39:16,098
the damage by a certain amount, provided you have
a free hand. If you reduce the damage to zero, you

3004
03:39:16,098 --> 03:39:20,493
can catch the missile, midair, (whoosh) stop it
from hitting you.

3005
03:39:20,493 --> 03:39:22,721
TALIESIN: That might be good for you, though.

3006
03:39:22,721 --> 03:39:24,546
LAURA: For anybody with ranged, probably.

3007
03:39:24,546 --> 03:39:26,410
MATT: Anybody who's hit by ranged.

3008
03:39:26,410 --> 03:39:28,643
TALIESIN: I have a two-handed ranged weapon,
though, which you do not.

3009
03:39:28,643 --> 03:39:34,576
MATT: Looking at the hat itself, while not a very
impressive hat, the magical energy on it does give

3010
03:39:34,576 --> 03:39:41,623
you the idea that it is used as an illusion-based
magic. It is a Hat of Disguise. While wearing this

3011
03:39:41,623 --> 03:39:47,180
hat you can use an action to cast the Disguise
Self spell at will. It ends if the hat is

3012
03:39:47,180 --> 03:39:48,222
removed.

3013
03:39:48,222 --> 03:39:50,073
SAM: May I have that one, please?

3014
03:39:50,073 --> 03:39:51,296
TALIESIN: No, Scanlan.

3015
03:39:51,296 --> 03:39:53,448
TRAVIS: What? He can already disappear.

3016
03:39:53,448 --> 03:39:55,956
FELICIA: You'll abuse it. You've already abused
that privilege already.

3017
03:39:55,956 --> 03:40:00,922
SAM: I'm sorry. By the way, your lips taste like
bubblegum.

3018
03:40:00,922 --> 03:40:13,061
MATT: The potion is a Potion of Climbing. You can
actually climb your walking speed for one hour.

3019
03:40:13,061 --> 03:40:14,413
MARY: Like Spider Climb?

3020
03:40:14,413 --> 03:40:16,078
FELICIA: Spider Pig.

3021
03:40:16,078 --> 03:40:17,615
MARY: What's it called?

3022
03:40:17,615 --> 03:40:25,336
MATT: Climbing or scaling cliffs, you can go at
the speed-- normally, you're very slow when you

3023
03:40:25,336 --> 03:40:31,395
climb. You can just parkour up super fast. While
this is happening, because you rolled a 20, you

3024
03:40:31,395 --> 03:40:35,694
look over at the corpses that are frozen on the
ground. You see one of the corpses is wielding a

3025
03:40:35,694 --> 03:40:41,894
sword, and another one of the corpses appears to
have a shattered bow in one hand. You go over and

3026
03:40:41,894 --> 03:40:46,879
see the sword itself is not affected by the ice.
It actually seems to be resisting the ice. You

3027
03:40:46,879 --> 03:40:52,740
(cracking) break it out of the hand. The person
who's holding the bow, currently, the upper torso

3028
03:40:52,740 --> 03:40:56,951
is bitten off and shattered. Part of the body is
ruined. The bow is broken and destroyed, but there

3029
03:40:56,951 --> 03:41:02,504
is a quiver on its back. Within the quiver, you
see most of the arrows are frozen solid within the

3030
03:41:02,504 --> 03:41:05,420
quiver, but there is one that seems unaffected by
the ice.

3031
03:41:05,420 --> 03:41:08,136
LAURA: Can I tell what it is?

3032
03:41:08,136 --> 03:41:12,800
MATT: You pull out the arrow. It appears to be a
deep forest green, and the actual shaft of the

3033
03:41:12,800 --> 03:41:18,873
arrow has a texture to it, almost a rough metallic
texture.

3034
03:41:18,873 --> 03:41:22,707
SAM, MARY, and TRAVIS: Take it!

3035
03:41:22,707 --> 03:41:24,497
LAURA: I'm taking it! Are you kidding me?

3036
03:41:24,497 --> 03:41:27,750
MATT: If you wish to bring those over to Lyra.
Lyra, make an arcana check.

3037
03:41:27,750 --> 03:41:32,160
FELICIA: This is a very interesting arrow. I
haven't seen one of these like this. Oh, wait,

3038
03:41:32,160 --> 03:41:37,060
maybe I have. 27.

3039
03:41:37,060 --> 03:41:41,061
MATT: Good to know. You take the time with it. You
immediately recognize, there is a similar

3040
03:41:41,061 --> 03:41:44,504
enchantment on both of these weapons, and whoever
came in here earlier had the intent of slaying

3041
03:41:44,504 --> 03:41:52,442
this dragon and failed to do so. What you find is
a Dragon-Slayer Longsword. Which is a plus-one

3042
03:41:52,442 --> 03:41:56,503
weapon, normally, but against dragons or people of
the dragon subtype, it deals an additional 3d6

3043
03:41:56,503 --> 03:41:58,037
damage with every hit.

3044
03:41:58,037 --> 03:41:59,561
FELICIA: It's too bad it didn't work for them.

3045
03:41:59,561 --> 03:42:08,474
MATT: And an Arrow of Dragon-Slaying. It's a
singular arrow, a one-use arrow, but if it hits a

3046
03:42:08,474 --> 03:42:14,440
dragon of the dragon race, type, or group, it has
to make a constitution saving throw or take an

3047
03:42:14,440 --> 03:42:20,339
additional 6d10 piercing damage. It's a one-use,
"fuck you, dragon" arrow.

3048
03:42:20,339 --> 03:42:22,560
SAM: 6d10?

3049
03:42:22,560 --> 03:42:23,979
FELICIA: That's very pleasant.

3050
03:42:23,979 --> 03:42:27,638
LAURA: Yeah, right? What is the saving throw?

3051
03:42:27,638 --> 03:42:32,233
SAM: You'll see. You're going to get the paper.

3052
03:42:32,233 --> 03:42:36,663
MATT: So at this point, you guys have taken
probably a good hour and a half or so in this

3053
03:42:36,663 --> 03:42:38,840
cavern. You start seeing water drip.

3054
03:42:38,840 --> 03:42:40,757
LAURA: Oh, we should get out.

3055
03:42:40,757 --> 03:42:44,509
MATT: It's beginning to thaw in the absence of
Rimefang.

3056
03:42:44,509 --> 03:42:52,249
MARY: Well, what's good is, I believe we're within
the three days of the contract, yes?

3057
03:42:52,249 --> 03:42:53,385
MATT: Possibly.

3058
03:42:53,385 --> 03:42:57,774
FELICIA: Well, we got the contract. We completed
it within three days. Now, we have to get back.

3059
03:42:57,774 --> 03:43:01,509
MARY: Yes, we've killed it, so let's go home.

3060
03:43:01,509 --> 03:43:04,190
MATT: Percy, you go and you pull out the contract
real fast to inspect it, and you can see that the

3061
03:43:04,190 --> 03:43:11,594
arcane sigils that were built into it are faded,
and where it looks like each piece of the dragon

3062
03:43:11,594 --> 03:43:19,368
that you harvested correctly, has seemingly had a
strange, glimmering gold shimmer from the actual

3063
03:43:19,368 --> 03:43:20,761
text on the contract.

3064
03:43:20,761 --> 03:43:22,290
LAURA: Lyra, they're going to love you.

3065
03:43:22,290 --> 03:43:26,272
FELICIA: It's so exciting. I can't wait to go to
the mess hall and tell everybody, many times, over

3066
03:43:26,272 --> 03:43:30,368
and over, how this happened together. And you
guys, this has been an amazing journey. Thank

3067
03:43:30,368 --> 03:43:31,476
you.

3068
03:43:31,476 --> 03:43:37,746
MARY: I would like to take just one gold coin
right at the base of the head of what was formerly

3069
03:43:37,746 --> 03:43:42,783
Rimefang for myself. I'll put it in a necklace
when we all go back to town.

3070
03:43:42,783 --> 03:43:46,740
MATT: All right. You take that one gold piece,
pocket it. Take a moment to remember your final

3071
03:43:46,740 --> 03:43:51,957
death blow against the dragon. You guys trek back
through the caverns you arose, back through the

3072
03:43:51,957 --> 03:43:58,008
ruined frost giant village, back into the Vesper
Timberland, find where your horses were currently

3073
03:43:58,008 --> 03:44:03,336
tied up, make your way back towards the city of
Vasselheim. About a day and a half's worth of

3074
03:44:03,336 --> 03:44:09,046
travel later, you notice that the blizzard that
encompassed the six-mile radius of this mountain

3075
03:44:09,046 --> 03:44:14,702
range has faded into a soft fog, and the actual
weather in this area seems to have been connected

3076
03:44:14,702 --> 03:44:20,664
to the presence of the dragon and is slowly
dissipating. You eventually take yourself to the

3077
03:44:20,664 --> 03:44:26,016
base of Vasselheim's main wall. You shout at the
top of the wall, and noticing the group arriving,

3078
03:44:26,016 --> 03:44:31,712
they let the doors open. You can see the giant,
dragon-headed ballistae that line the city walls

3079
03:44:31,712 --> 03:44:36,903
are armed and ready, and upon approval, they move
them away. You enter the city, make your way

3080
03:44:36,903 --> 03:44:43,976
through the Braving Grounds to the Quadroads to
the outside of the Slayer's Take guildhall. As you

3081
03:44:43,976 --> 03:44:50,161
enter the main room, you see Mertin is standing
there. Looks like he's playing a game of solitaire

3082
03:44:50,161 --> 03:44:59,999
with a deck of cards. He looks up. "Well, I'll be
damned. Are you serious? You killed him?"

3083
03:44:59,999 --> 03:45:01,474
FELICIA: Mertin, we did it.

3084
03:45:01,474 --> 03:45:03,325
MATT: "Show me your contract. Show me this
contract."

3085
03:45:03,325 --> 03:45:09,871
FELICIA: I don't know why you'd doubt us. Really,
it's right here.

3086
03:45:09,871 --> 03:45:20,528
MATT: "Well done." And he puts his hand out to
shake your hand.

3087
03:45:20,528 --> 03:45:26,598
FELICIA: Oh my gosh. I start crying. This is the
most proud moment of my life, Mertin. I've admired

3088
03:45:26,598 --> 03:45:30,985
you for so long and the fact (cries) thank you.
And then I just hug him.

3089
03:45:30,985 --> 03:45:39,102
MATT: Okay. He hugs you. "I appreciate it very
much. You lost me 200 gold pieces, but well done.

3090
03:45:39,102 --> 03:45:44,516
"You've proven to be more than I expected. Let me
get the Huntmistress. She will be very happy to

3091
03:45:44,516 --> 03:45:50,875
"see that you've arrived. Aye, my wife. Yes." And
he gets up and leaves. A few moments later, the

3092
03:45:50,875 --> 03:45:58,860
headmaster Vanessa Cyndrial comes in, her tiefling
self with her horns curled behind her head. Walks

3093
03:45:58,860 --> 03:46:09,505
in with this smooth glare. "I must say. Some of
these contracts we put out as a test of your power

3094
03:46:09,505 --> 03:46:16,614
"and will, and to be perfectly honest, I was
pulling for you." She puts out her hand and her

3095
03:46:16,614 --> 03:46:22,406
husband takes a pouch of coin and puts it in her
hand. She takes it and puts it on the side of her

3096
03:46:22,406 --> 03:46:30,589
belt. "I'm impressed by all of you, and by this
token, and by the completed contract. First off,

3097
03:46:30,589 --> 03:46:34,058
"you have definitely proven your worth to the
Slayer's Take."

3098
03:46:34,058 --> 03:46:36,850
FELICIA: Oh my god, that is so sweet, Vanessa.

3099
03:46:36,850 --> 03:46:41,777
MATT: "Keep the emotions in check. We have to put
up a face here. No one wants to see a member of

3100
03:46:41,777 --> 03:46:50,733
"the guild cry. Now, for the rest of you, I would
like to humbly ask if you wish to join the

3101
03:46:50,733 --> 03:46:52,789
"Slayer's Take guild."

3102
03:46:52,789 --> 03:46:54,814
SAM: Yeah, sure, that'll work. The bear, too?

3103
03:46:54,814 --> 03:46:59,284
MATT: "The bear, as well. Best not show him the
back room. We have a few trophies back there that

3104
03:46:59,284 --> 03:47:00,995
"might freak him out."

3105
03:47:00,995 --> 03:47:04,018
TRAVIS: Do we get to work with another leader next
time?

3106
03:47:04,018 --> 03:47:10,243
SAM: What? Because if the answer is yes, we
refuse. This is our leader from now on.

3107
03:47:10,243 --> 03:47:11,522
FELICIA: Thank you so much.

3108
03:47:11,522 --> 03:47:16,023
MATT: "You are able to choose what your group is
at any time. Whatever the contract requires."

3109
03:47:16,023 --> 03:47:26,557
FELICIA: I really appreciate it, but given the
kiss that we had, I realized why Aldor doesn't

3110
03:47:26,557 --> 03:47:34,250
love me is that I don't have enough experience.
Sexually. So I'm going to stay in town to spread

3111
03:47:34,250 --> 03:47:40,429
my wings in that area. And then he'll love me.
Won't he, Vanessa?

3112
03:47:40,429 --> 03:47:48,211
MATT: Vanessa goes, "Lyra, I would recommend this
course of action to not be taken. I would think

3113
03:47:48,211 --> 03:47:54,869
"that would reflect poorly-- I mean, your personal
time is your own, but nevertheless, my dear, this

3114
03:47:54,869 --> 03:47:56,218
"is a very pious house--"

3115
03:47:56,218 --> 03:47:58,032
SAM: I think this is a great idea.

3116
03:47:58,032 --> 03:48:02,941
FELICIA: Oh, no. Not you. You're such a friend to
me. I can't ruin that.

3117
03:48:02,941 --> 03:48:04,511
SAM: You're right.

3118
03:48:04,511 --> 03:48:10,230
MATT: Vanessa walks up and puts her hand on your
shoulder and goes, "We're going to have a talk,

3119
03:48:10,230 --> 03:48:11,561
"woman to woman."

3120
03:48:11,561 --> 03:48:14,305
FELICIA: (whispers) Oh my god, you guys, I'm in!

3121
03:48:14,305 --> 03:48:18,993
MARY: Be straight with her, will you? Please.

3122
03:48:18,993 --> 03:48:25,871
MATT: "I'm going to make sure she doesn't
embarrass the rest of us. So with the contract

3123
03:48:25,871 --> 03:48:33,500
"completed, provide what you've harvested from your
quarry, and payment will be delivered."

3124
03:48:33,500 --> 03:48:38,809
LAURA: I put the bag down that's got all the stuff
in it. And then we take out a couple from the

3125
03:48:38,809 --> 03:48:44,832
white dragon, and put out the other stuff. And
we've got this giant heart right here.

3126
03:48:44,832 --> 03:48:53,127
MATT: The heart, which Grog has been carrying on
his back as you guys travel. (impact sound) It

3127
03:48:53,127 --> 03:48:59,702
hits the table and the wood cracks a little bit
beneath it from the impact. And you can see, the

3128
03:48:59,702 --> 03:49:01,463
ice is starting to melt a bit on the exterior.

3129
03:49:01,463 --> 03:49:03,321
LAURA: Careful, it needs to be preserved.

3130
03:49:03,321 --> 03:49:10,047
MATT: She gives a nod. "Very well. Mertin, please,
provide these for transport to the contract

3131
03:49:10,047 --> 03:49:11,473
"client."

3132
03:49:11,473 --> 03:49:14,276
MARY: Can we ask who actually contracted it?

3133
03:49:14,276 --> 03:49:16,746
MATT: "It's written on the contract itself."

3134
03:49:16,746 --> 03:49:18,104
MARY: Oh, that's right. I'm so sorry.

3135
03:49:18,104 --> 03:49:20,204
MATT: Percy has the contract, currently.

3136
03:49:20,204 --> 03:49:23,429
TALIESIN: I do. Ozwyn Grud?

3137
03:49:23,429 --> 03:49:25,457
TRAVIS: Grundle?

3138
03:49:25,457 --> 03:49:28,790
FELICIA: Alchemist Ozwyn Grud.

3139
03:49:28,832 --> 03:49:32,450
MATT: Make a history check, by the way.

3140
03:49:32,450 --> 03:49:36,689
TALIESIN: May I, as well?

3141
03:49:36,689 --> 03:49:37,843
FELICIA: 21.

3142
03:49:37,843 --> 03:49:42,762
TALIESIN: 25.

3143
03:49:42,762 --> 03:49:52,272
TRAVIS: Oh, a history check? Four. He's a person.

3144
03:49:52,272 --> 03:49:57,482
MARY: I had four, as well. We are so getting shots
later. Like, now.

3145
03:49:57,482 --> 03:50:00,453
LAURA: Nine.

3146
03:50:00,453 --> 03:50:03,882
MATT: All right. The two of you immediately go,
"Huh," and it hits you: you've heard the name

3147
03:50:03,882 --> 03:50:09,453
before. You've heard the name and you're trying to
figure out where it is. You pick it up and say,

3148
03:50:09,453 --> 03:50:21,268
"He's a member of the Arcana Pansophical." It's a
really exclusive group of archmages across the

3149
03:50:21,268 --> 03:50:28,223
entire globe that essentially work together to
keep the peace on a global scale. Of which, you

3150
03:50:28,223 --> 03:50:36,638
know that Arcanist Allura Vysoren is a member of
the Arcana Pansophical.

3151
03:50:36,638 --> 03:50:38,091
TALIESIN: Yes, of course.

3152
03:50:38,091 --> 03:50:40,290
MATT: This is another member of that team, who
ordered this.

3153
03:50:40,290 --> 03:50:44,392
TALIESIN: This is most likely going to good use,
at the very least.

3154
03:50:44,392 --> 03:50:46,751
SAM: So do we collect our money?

3155
03:50:46,751 --> 03:50:49,863
MATT: "Indeed. What is the total on that contract,
if you don't mind repeating?"

3156
03:50:49,863 --> 03:50:51,312
TALIESIN: I was just working that out.

3157
03:50:51,312 --> 03:50:52,664
LAURA: Lots of gold.

3158
03:50:52,664 --> 03:51:02,692
TALIESIN: Lots of gold. It's 1,800 for the dragon
eyes, 1,200 for the dragon tongue. 3,500 for the

3159
03:51:02,692 --> 03:51:10,862
heart. 1,500 for the claws, and then how much for
the dragon teeth?

3160
03:51:10,862 --> 03:51:15,219
LAURA: Per dragon's tooth? Or for all six dragon
teeth?

3161
03:51:15,219 --> 03:51:17,315
TALIESIN: For all 20 dragon teeth.

3162
03:51:17,315 --> 03:51:22,584
MATT: Yeah. Essentially, considering the dragon
teeth that you had already stored, those are used

3163
03:51:22,584 --> 03:51:26,507
in this transaction, as well as the claws. So you
no longer have dragon's teeth and dragon claws

3164
03:51:26,507 --> 03:51:30,510
stored in your bag. However, you've fulfilled the
contract and get full payment for those.

3165
03:51:30,510 --> 03:51:32,058
TRAVIS: We have 12 teeth left.

3166
03:51:32,058 --> 03:51:35,085
SAM: So it's 9,000 total?

3167
03:51:35,085 --> 03:51:36,239
TALIESIN: 9,000 total.

3168
03:51:36,239 --> 03:51:41,873
MATT: "9,000 gold pieces." She reaches beneath,
pulls out a small chest. You see her do something

3169
03:51:41,873 --> 03:51:46,580
beneath the table you don't recognize, and all of a
sudden you hear a clicking sound and she pulls up

3170
03:51:46,580 --> 03:51:51,868
three large sacks of gold (heavy impacts) on the
table. "Divide as you see fit. On top of this, as

3171
03:51:51,868 --> 03:51:57,690
"you have now been accepted to this, when your
other team members arrive, which should be any

3172
03:51:57,690 --> 03:52:03,012
"moment now, in the next day or so, you'll be
inducted, you'll be absolved of your breach of the

3173
03:52:03,012 --> 03:52:08,381
"laws of Vasselheim, and you will also acquire a
small payment in conjunction with the hydra

3174
03:52:08,381 --> 03:52:15,529
"contract. So we will discuss this as soon as your
friends arrive. Until then, feel free to rest,

3175
03:52:15,529 --> 03:52:18,204
"divide the gold, and be on your way."

3176
03:52:18,204 --> 03:52:19,723
LAURA: That's 1,500 each.

3177
03:52:19,723 --> 03:52:20,961
SAM and TALIESIN: Thank you.

3178
03:52:20,961 --> 03:52:22,639
FELICIA: Oh, I don't need any. (laughs)

3179
03:52:22,639 --> 03:52:24,123
LAURA: What about you, Zahra?

3180
03:52:24,123 --> 03:52:26,834
MARY: Oh, I need. I'll take, definitely. Thank
you.

3181
03:52:26,834 --> 03:52:29,744
MATT: "You do not need your money? Well, that will
go back to the guild, thank you."

3182
03:52:29,744 --> 03:52:31,347
TRAVIS: No, she misspoke.

3183
03:52:31,347 --> 03:52:35,454
MARY: She misspoke. I'm so sorry. She completely
misspoke.

3184
03:52:35,454 --> 03:52:38,761
MATT: (chuckles) "Very well." Tosses the coins.

3185
03:52:38,761 --> 03:52:42,655
LAURA: 1,800 each.

3186
03:52:42,655 --> 03:52:49,328
MATT: "Well done. Congratulations, and I look
forward to a very fruitful and profitable future

3187
03:52:49,328 --> 03:52:51,270
"together here at the Slayer's Take."

3188
03:52:51,270 --> 03:52:56,413
TRAVIS: Aye. Scanlan, should we go and make sure
that your wounds are completely healed?

3189
03:52:56,413 --> 03:52:59,329
LAURA: Can we insight check Vanessa really fast?

3190
03:52:59,329 --> 03:53:00,920
MATT: You may. What are you trying to gather?

3191
03:53:00,920 --> 03:53:02,708
LAURA: Just to see what kind of person she is.

3192
03:53:02,708 --> 03:53:05,446
MATT: All right, go for an insight check.

3193
03:53:05,446 --> 03:53:10,295
LAURA: 24.

3194
03:53:10,295 --> 03:53:16,932
MATT: Okay. You know you have a very strong sense
of being able to read a person, and yet she is

3195
03:53:16,932 --> 03:53:24,914
still an enigma to you. She seems earnest. She
seems definitely a shrewd businesswoman, and

3196
03:53:24,914 --> 03:53:28,592
there's a reason this guild has been successful
for as long as she's been at the helm of it. But

3197
03:53:28,592 --> 03:53:33,767
as far as reading her intent? She seems very
guarded and hard to read. You're unable to really

3198
03:53:33,767 --> 03:53:35,128
catch a bead on her.

3199
03:53:35,128 --> 03:53:39,102
FELICIA: Vanessa, I want to thank you for trusting
me with this very difficult task. I know that you

3200
03:53:39,102 --> 03:53:45,335
sent some other people after this dragon, and your
confidence in our abilities over theirs, who were

3201
03:53:45,335 --> 03:53:48,877
defeated? It's just fantastic. I mean, what were
you thinking?

3202
03:53:48,877 --> 03:53:50,525
TRAVIS: What were you thinking?

3203
03:53:50,525 --> 03:53:52,170
TALIESIN: What were you thinking, really?

3204
03:53:52,170 --> 03:53:57,339
MATT: "Well, to be perfectly honest, this dragon
had been a thorn in our side, with previous

3205
03:53:57,339 --> 03:54:03,775
"contracts failed on its side, and you all seemed
so confident in your skills. I figured it would be

3206
03:54:03,775 --> 03:54:08,056
"a good excuse for you to either flee from this
thing and come back with your tail between your

3207
03:54:08,056 --> 03:54:12,225
"legs, or be foolish and get yourself killed, in
which case, you're not a problem of ours anymore

3208
03:54:12,225 --> 03:54:18,547
"and everything's fine. Or, best case scenario,
what you've shown to me today."

3209
03:54:18,547 --> 03:54:20,015
LAURA: Which is that we're amazing.

3210
03:54:20,015 --> 03:54:21,707
TRAVIS: Vox Machina does not flee.

3211
03:54:21,707 --> 03:54:24,865
MARY: Never. Although I'm not a part of it.

3212
03:54:24,865 --> 03:54:27,614
SAM: We'll make you an honorary member.

3213
03:54:27,614 --> 03:54:33,766
MATT: "Anyway, I have business to attend to. Enjoy
your night. Celebrate. And return here when you

3214
03:54:33,766 --> 03:54:37,098
"wish to see your friends hopefully return as
successful as you were."

3215
03:54:37,098 --> 03:54:38,635
SAM and MARY: Thank you.

3216
03:54:38,635 --> 03:54:40,288
TRAVIS: We are sure they will.

3217
03:54:40,288 --> 03:54:46,144
MATT: "Mertin!" "Yes, I know, my dear. I'm taking
it." And he takes the heart and (grunts) lifts it

3218
03:54:46,144 --> 03:54:51,371
over his back and the halfling, as thick as he is,
(grunts) is bringing it to the back room. She

3219
03:54:51,371 --> 03:54:57,208
turns around, gathers the rest of the materials
into a sack, and exits the room. And with that, we

3220
03:54:57,208 --> 03:54:59,821
will conclude tonight's session. Well done!

3221
03:54:59,821 --> 03:55:01,281
SAM: We did it!

3222
03:55:01,281 --> 03:55:02,974
MARY: We survived!

3223
03:55:02,974 --> 03:55:06,602
LAURA: Good job, Mary!

3224
03:55:06,602 --> 03:55:10,769
MATT: By the way, these are your magical items.
You want to go ahead and take those?

3225
03:55:10,769 --> 03:55:12,929
SAM: I have to split.

3226
03:55:12,929 --> 03:55:16,499
TALIESIN: Yes, you're moving.

3227
03:55:16,499 --> 03:55:17,639
FELICIA: Tonight?

3228
03:55:17,639 --> 03:55:18,789
TALIESIN: Tomorrow.

3229
03:55:18,789 --> 03:55:19,923
FELICIA: Oh my goodness.

3230
03:55:19,923 --> 03:55:29,823
MATT: First off, guys, a big round of applause and
appreciation for our guests. Mary, Felicia. You

3231
03:55:29,823 --> 03:55:31,525
guys were fantastic.

3232
03:55:31,525 --> 03:55:34,480
TALIESIN: Guest dragon kill.

3233
03:55:34,480 --> 03:55:40,020
FELICIA: That was very fun. Thank you for letting
me guest and be on the Twitch channel. You guys

3234
03:55:40,020 --> 03:55:46,244
are a joy to have. I'm so proud to be part of the
Geek and Sundry family.

3235
03:55:46,244 --> 03:55:51,282
MARY: I would like to say thank you so much to the
community, to the Critters out there. I've never

3236
03:55:51,282 --> 03:55:57,478
felt so much love overnight and through this last
week. You inspired me today, and all of us, so

3237
03:55:57,478 --> 03:55:59,077
thank you so much.

3238
03:55:59,077 --> 03:56:04,327
ZAC: Speaking of Critters, #CriticalRole is
officially trending on Twitter right now on the

3239
03:56:04,327 --> 03:56:10,866
front page. You guys should all keep that trend
going and go tell us what you think about the show

3240
03:56:10,866 --> 03:56:16,686
and your favorite moments from tonight with
#CriticalRole, @GeekandSundry. A couple of other

3241
03:56:16,686 --> 03:56:22,086
quick announcements. Thank you, Felicia, for
coming out. She's about to leave for a month,

3242
03:56:22,086 --> 03:56:23,134
right?

3243
03:56:23,134 --> 03:56:27,202
FELICIA: I'm going on a book tour, so please, if
you haven't, preorder my book. feliciadaybook.com.

3244
03:56:27,202 --> 03:56:35,240
I'm going to 12 cities, then DragonCon. I'm pretty
excited about it. I'm going all over. I'm sorry,

3245
03:56:35,240 --> 03:56:37,550
Midwest. It'll be fun.

3246
03:56:37,550 --> 03:56:41,980
ZAC: Speaking of her book, guys, we are 60
subscribers away, roughly, from doing another

3247
03:56:41,980 --> 03:56:47,520
signed book giveaway. Subs are what keep this
channel alive. We wouldn't be able to bring you

3248
03:56:47,520 --> 03:56:52,508
this content without subscribers, so let's try to
get that 60 before we're done reading all our

3249
03:56:52,508 --> 03:56:56,964
donations and prizes and everything else. But
actually, I think we're going to play that video

3250
03:56:56,964 --> 03:57:00,210
of Felicia one more time really quick to support
her book tour.

3251
03:57:00,210 --> 03:57:01,888
FELICIA: That's very sweet.

3252
03:57:01,888 --> 03:57:04,986
ZAC: We'll be right back, really quick, with our
donations and everything.

3253
03:57:04,986 --> 03:57:06,166
MATT: Yes.

3254
03:57:06,166 --> 04:28:00,574
