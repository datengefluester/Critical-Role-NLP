1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,845
MATT: Hello, everyone! And welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,845 --> 00:00:07,978
nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons,
and occasionally curse at me before the stream.

3
00:00:07,978 --> 00:00:13,014
You ass. Every time. You guys have caught him a
few times. Anyway, welcome to tonight's game.

4
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:17,438
Ashley Johnson unfortunately cannot join us this
evening. She's finishing up stuff at Blindspot,

5
00:00:17,438 --> 00:00:18,975
but we hope to have her back next week.

6
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:20,636
TRAVIS: Yeah! Ashley Johnson! Blindspot!

7
00:00:20,636 --> 00:00:22,857
LIAM: Come back, Shane!

8
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:29,512
MATT: Fingers crossed on that one. Sam Riegel also
will be here a little late-- more than usual late.

9
00:00:29,512 --> 00:00:35,972
Travis will be taking over Scanlan until he
arrives.

10
00:00:35,972 --> 00:00:39,913
LAURA: What if you kill him? What if he dies while
you're--

11
00:00:39,913 --> 00:00:42,968
MATT: I know you were kidding, but now you have
to.

12
00:00:42,968 --> 00:00:45,762
TRAVIS: There are better ways to go. Worse ways.
Whatever.

13
00:00:45,762 --> 00:00:48,397
MATT: We'll see what transpires by the time he
gets here. Hopefully he'll have a character left.

14
00:00:48,397 --> 00:00:50,321
TALIESIN: You can do a limerick. It'll be
exciting.

15
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:51,593
TRAVIS: Nope.

16
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,267
MATT: All right, so before we get started, we're
going to go ahead and run through our

17
00:00:54,267 --> 00:01:00,340
announcements, so we can hop right in. We've got a
fun game ready for you guys tonight. First and

18
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:05,691
foremost, next Monday, at 7:00pm, here on Geek and
Sundry's Twitch stream, taking over the spot for

19
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:12,616
No Survivors, we'll be running a Critical Role one
shot. I'll be running a game of Pathfinder, where

20
00:01:12,616 --> 00:01:19,314
our campaign actually started. A one-shot evening
with a host of great players. Taliesin and Marisha

21
00:01:19,314 --> 00:01:20,691
will be joining us on that--

22
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:22,679
(cheering)

23
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:24,575
MATT: Way to prove me wrong!

24
00:01:24,575 --> 00:01:26,126
LAURA: What happened?

25
00:01:26,126 --> 00:01:27,598
LIAM: No singing Travis?

26
00:01:27,598 --> 00:01:29,965
TRAVIS: He must have heard on Twitch and came
running.

27
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:33,652
SAM: Yeah, that can't happen. No way.

28
00:01:33,652 --> 00:01:38,297
MATT: That's amazing. All right. Well, welcome!

29
00:01:38,297 --> 00:01:42,201
TRAVIS: (laughs) Man, I didn't get to masturbate
in public.

30
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:44,432
MATT: Oh, night's still young, Travis.

31
00:01:44,432 --> 00:01:46,111
LAURA: There's always tomorrow, darling.

32
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:47,775
LIAM: You think Grog is above that?

33
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:54,214
MATT: Remember, Twitch is live. That's not going
to happen. So yeah!

34
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,734
SAM: Oh shit, it's in my car.

35
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:56,599
MATT: What happened?

36
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,736
TALIESIN: What do you need, what do you need?

37
00:01:57,736 --> 00:01:58,932
SAM: It's okay. I'm good.

38
00:01:58,932 --> 00:02:00,967
LIAM: You're going to wing it? You remember your
numbers? Yeah, go get it, we're doing

39
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:01,976
announcements.

40
00:02:01,976 --> 00:02:03,411
SAM: It's literally in my other car.

41
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:04,700
MATT: I can text you your character sheet.

42
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,971
SAM: But I have my PDF.

43
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:09,782
MATT: You have your PDF, you're good. Okay, so. I
think--

44
00:02:09,782 --> 00:02:11,094
TALIESIN: Pathfinder!

45
00:02:11,094 --> 00:02:17,856
MATT: Actually, if I recall, I think I may have
left that behind as well. I made an extra copy of

46
00:02:17,856 --> 00:02:19,258
your character.

47
00:02:19,258 --> 00:02:21,414
TALIESIN: I've made an extra copy of your
character.

48
00:02:21,414 --> 00:02:27,763
MATT: There you go. He got this. Perfect.
Next Monday, 7:00pm-10:00pm, possibly a little

49
00:02:27,845 --> 00:02:31,590
over that, we'll see. You know how these sessions
go. I'll be running a game of Pathfinder. Taliesin

50
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,627
and Marisha will be playing, as well as Ivan Van
Norman, as he is allowing us to take his spot for

51
00:02:35,627 --> 00:02:39,437
No Survivors, he will be a player in that game, as
well as two special guests. We'll have Ashly

52
00:02:39,437 --> 00:02:44,336
Burch, the wonderful, talented, amazing Ashly
Burch will be playing, as well as the incredible

53
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:48,987
Phil Lamarr. That'll be our troop of five
players.

54
00:02:48,987 --> 00:02:52,616
TRAVIS: Justice League, Futurama, Pulp Fiction.

55
00:02:52,616 --> 00:02:54,097
LAURA: Tales from the Borderlands?

56
00:02:54,097 --> 00:02:59,008
MATT: Yup. Ashly Burch, who's currently up for a
BAFTA as well. 'Cause apparently if your name's

57
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:01,023
Ashley, you get nominated for a BAFTA.

58
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:04,039
LAURA: The BAFTAs already happened. She didn't.

59
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,669
MATT: But she was nominated!

60
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:09,036
TALIESIN: BAFTA nominee Ashly Burch.

61
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:10,999
MATT: Exactly.

62
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:17,814
LIAM: She's also a delightful knucklehead, so
BAFTA aside.

63
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:24,282
MATT: She's awesome people. Love her to death and
we're excited to have her on. But yeah, so that'll

64
00:03:24,282 --> 00:03:29,920
be next Monday, 7:00pm Pacific here. Come watch,
it'll be fun! It'll be a little different than the

65
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:37,144
usual stuff here. Let's see. Next up, if my phone
would listen, there we go. Next week, next

66
00:03:37,144 --> 00:03:42,333
Thursday is our 50th episode. Crazy.

67
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,690
TRAVIS: Explosion. Brain matter everywhere.

68
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:50,483
MATT: It's been crazy that we've gotten to a 50th
episode point, so it'll be a loose celebration.

69
00:03:50,483 --> 00:03:58,388
We'll have a game, couple surprises, and we'll be
finishing it off with a grand Critmas finale for

70
00:03:58,388 --> 00:04:00,375
this year until we get in the holidays.

71
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,899
LAURA: It's all happening that night?

72
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:03,250
MATT: We don't have a choice.

73
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,618
LAURA: Longest night ever!

74
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:05,726
MARISHA and MATT: Longest night ever!

75
00:04:05,726 --> 00:04:08,967
MATT: We were going to try and find another night
maybe to do Critmas, but their scheduling won't

76
00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:10,168
allow it.

77
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:12,076
LIAM: Cheers to a seven-hour stream.

78
00:04:12,076 --> 00:04:14,179
TALIESIN: Oh god, I'm going to die.

79
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:18,668
MATT: They're prepping to try and make it
transition as fast as possible so we aren't here

80
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:19,758
until 4:00am.

81
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:21,914
MARISHA: And by they're you mean us?

82
00:04:21,914 --> 00:04:28,681
MATT: Yes. Come next week for an awesome
spectacular! It'll be great! You'll enjoy it.

83
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:30,474
LAURA: Spectacular, spectacular.

84
00:04:30,474 --> 00:04:37,441
MATT: Good. Marisha, you want to talk about
Hector's thing?

85
00:04:37,441 --> 00:04:45,489
MARISHA: Hector Navarro, aka @Hectorisfunny on
Twitter, is the next host up for Signal Boost, and

86
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:51,513
his first episode happened this Tuesday and he's
fucking hilarious. You have to watch him.

87
00:04:51,513 --> 00:04:53,337
TRAVIS: He is, it's great.

88
00:04:53,337 --> 00:04:57,353
MARISHA: He's really funny. And this coming up
episode might be one of my favorite ones.

89
00:04:57,353 --> 00:05:02,152
MATT: Yeah, the opening joke for this next episode
made me laugh out loud on the ground for five

90
00:05:02,152 --> 00:05:03,173
minutes.

91
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:04,682
MARISHA: Yes, that's a true story.

92
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:06,929
LAURA: Don't build it up too much. Now they'll be
expecting it, Matt.

93
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:11,565
MATT: It's the best thing you've ever seen. You
will die it's so funny!

94
00:05:11,565 --> 00:05:15,559
MARISHA: Anyway, give him love. Go watch it. It's
funny. It's very funny. And he has great things

95
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:16,762
that he boosts.

96
00:05:16,762 --> 00:05:25,083
MATT: Exactly. Let's see. Also, if you guys
haven't seen it, we did a fun one-shot game with

97
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:28,711
Kinda Funny, with Greg Miller and their crew up
in San Francisco and the episodes have been going

98
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:33,461
up this week, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, finishing with today, so if you want to

99
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:37,633
go check it out, it's a ridiculous two-hour game
we played, broken up over four episodes. I think

100
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:43,134
the full episode goes up standalone tomorrow, but
it's a lot of fun. We had Travis, Laura and

101
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,117
Marisha all playing in that game and--

102
00:05:45,117 --> 00:05:49,115
LAURA: Different characters. We weren't our
regular characters, but equally fun, I thought.

103
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,246
MATT: Yeah. Who'd you play?

104
00:05:51,246 --> 00:05:54,452
LAURA: I played Jester, a tiefling cleric.

105
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:57,324
MATT: Yes, it was delightful. Marisha, what'd you
play?

106
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:58,956
LAURA: Yeah.

107
00:05:58,956 --> 00:06:00,801
MARISHA: What was my character's name?

108
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:02,009
TRAVIS: <i>Wow!</i>

109
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:03,524
LAURA: You were a dwarf paladin.

110
00:06:03,524 --> 00:06:05,315
MARISHA: I know, but what was my character's
name?

111
00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:06,385
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

112
00:06:06,385 --> 00:06:08,065
LAURA: I don't remember.

113
00:06:08,065 --> 00:06:14,713
MATT: I think it was Scottish McSweedsen. Accent
McDialect.

114
00:06:14,713 --> 00:06:16,331
LAURA: Ooh, hello!

115
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:24,991
MARISHA: Look, a lot's happened in a couple weeks,
okay? I've moved, I've had a change of scenery--

116
00:06:24,991 --> 00:06:30,587
MATT: It's true. But yeah, that's fun. Travis, you
got to play an Order of the Lycan Blood Hunter.

117
00:06:30,587 --> 00:06:40,465
TRAVIS: I did. McLaren von Tosscobble. Oh, it was
fun. He has secrets. And bourbon. He had lots of

118
00:06:40,465 --> 00:06:42,327
bourbon.

119
00:06:42,327 --> 00:06:44,952
MATT: So much bourbon. We may have been drinking
during that game, I don't know. But go check it

120
00:06:44,952 --> 00:06:49,107
out if you haven't. It was a lot of fun. Sam, you
had an announcement you wanted to make?

121
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:55,283
SAM: I play Zedd in the Ratchet and Clank game
that just came out.

122
00:06:55,283 --> 00:06:56,446
LIAM: It's a good game.

123
00:06:56,446 --> 00:07:00,773
SAM: It's a good game, it's getting good reviews!
I haven't seen what I did in it, but I assume it's

124
00:07:00,773 --> 00:07:02,044
nerdy.

125
00:07:02,044 --> 00:07:07,599
MATT: Good man. Fantastical. Liam--

126
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,230
LIAM: Hey man, I know you guys all love Wyrmwood
Gaming, but like this free-- the shipping is

127
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,991
killing me. Well the good news is, if you use the
code "critrole" you don't have to pay the

128
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,392
shipping, you just pay the cost for the box and they
send it to you.

129
00:07:20,392 --> 00:07:22,220
LAURA: Oh. These glorious boxes?

130
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,586
LIAM: These boxes by Wyrmwood Gaming. The code
again is "critrole". Not only that, but they have

131
00:07:26,586 --> 00:07:32,772
a Kickstarter going on. They are now selling, or
they're kickstarting their Sentinel deck box,

132
00:07:32,772 --> 00:07:35,192
which looks like this.

133
00:07:35,192 --> 00:07:36,982
MARISHA: Oh wait, I haven't seen this yet!

134
00:07:36,982 --> 00:07:41,441
LAURA: So wait, this is a regular Sentinel deck
box.

135
00:07:41,441 --> 00:07:45,926
LIAM: This is a regular. Now, for fans of the
show, you can get our logo etched into any of the

136
00:07:45,926 --> 00:07:48,119
boxes at any tier.

137
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:50,827
LAURA: This is another box. This one has our logo
etched into it.

138
00:07:50,827 --> 00:07:52,991
TALIESIN: What does it say at the bottom there?

139
00:07:52,991 --> 00:07:54,461
TRAVIS: You can do a rubbing on the front.

140
00:07:54,461 --> 00:07:56,204
LAURA: It says "How do you want to do this?"

141
00:07:56,204 --> 00:08:03,835
LIAM: But again, if you want to go full Gilmore,
we have the Masterworks box, which is freaking

142
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:09,292
gorgeous. The dice go in here, the Bluetooth is
hidden in there.

143
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:10,529
SAM: Bluetooth?!

144
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:14,385
LIAM: You'll never lose your shit. And then all
your cards go there.

145
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:17,322
SAM: Put your weed in there.

146
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:21,675
TALIESIN: You're not supposed to just come out and
say it.

147
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:27,312
TRAVIS: Can I do a sleight of hand roll?

148
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:33,915
LIAM: Lastly, if you go over to their Facebook
page right now for Wyrmwood Gaming, they're doing

149
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:39,863
a contest. They're giving away one of these mofos.
So all the rules for how the contest works are

150
00:08:39,863 --> 00:08:44,365
there. And you can get one of these for looking at
their Facebook page.

151
00:08:44,365 --> 00:08:45,657
LAURA: Sweet.

152
00:08:45,672 --> 00:08:46,581
LIAM: Critrole!

153
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:47,761
LAURA: Crit. Role!

154
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:53,376
MATT: And last but not least, as the subscriber
count continues, we're going to be doing

155
00:08:53,376 --> 00:08:57,686
giveaways. We actually got a great gift from
Midnight Syndicate, who, those of you who may have

156
00:08:57,686 --> 00:09:03,089
paid attention, created a lot of the music that I
use during our games. They're a phenomenal group

157
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:09,962
that has incredible tabletop gaming-centric music
for all sorts: fantasy, horror, Lovecraft-- they

158
00:09:09,962 --> 00:09:15,710
have an incredible array of tracks and they sent
us a bunch of CDs to give out to you guys. So we

159
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:21,511
are now folding these delightful Midnight
Syndicate CDs in as part of the giveaway as well.

160
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:25,404
What's the milestone we're hitting for
subscribers?

161
00:09:25,404 --> 00:09:28,692
CREW: I think it's 16,800?

162
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:34,976
MATT: So 16,800. When we hit that tonight, we'll
be giving away the next giveaway, which will

163
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:38,926
include this as well as art posters, and all the
other good stuff we give away as part of our

164
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:43,971
subscriber giveaways, so that's cool. Thank you,
Midnight Syndicate, you guys are awesome. Check

165
00:09:43,971 --> 00:09:50,085
out their stuff on the internet for your own home
games. It's brilliant stuff. All righty! So,

166
00:09:50,085 --> 00:09:57,742
without further ado, let's get back into the realm
of Exandria.

167
00:09:57,742 --> 00:10:00,726
TALIESIN: When we last left off, we were in a
cardboard box.

168
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:03,077
MATT: Yes. In Hobotown, USA.

169
00:10:03,077 --> 00:10:05,244
MARISHA: I knew this day would come.

170
00:10:05,244 --> 00:10:14,304
MATT: So last we left off, Vox Machina, having
traversed many places in the world in hopes of

171
00:10:14,304 --> 00:10:21,042
finding a way to expel or destroy the Chroma
Conclave, a collective of four chromatic dragons

172
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:28,266
that together managed to destroy large bastions of
society on the continent of Tal'Dorei and beyond

173
00:10:28,266 --> 00:10:33,491
in Wildemount. Thordak, the Cinder King, the
seeming leader of their group, currently sits in

174
00:10:33,491 --> 00:10:37,882
the center of the partially destroyed city of
Emon. The other dragons have scattered about and

175
00:10:37,882 --> 00:10:44,705
claimed their own territories. From this, the
party has discovered the existence of these

176
00:10:44,705 --> 00:10:50,782
legendary magical items, referred to as the
Vestiges of Divergence, that existed from wars

177
00:10:50,782 --> 00:10:56,050
long past. They were carried on from generation to
generation that contain power that may be

178
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:04,444
sufficient to defeat these creatures. You were
sent to seek out the nameless sphinx that exists

179
00:11:04,444 --> 00:11:09,547
somewhere near the Frostweald. Weeld-weld. It's
pronounced so many different ways--

180
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:10,893
SAM: Which is it? Which is it?

181
00:11:10,893 --> 00:11:15,920
MATT: It can be any of them, it's a magical world.
The Frostweald.

182
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,450
LAURA: Oh, it's right in between it.

183
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,364
MATT: It's in that weird place.

184
00:11:19,422 --> 00:11:22,105
TALIESIN: Frost Wilfred Brimley

185
00:11:22,105 --> 00:11:26,755
MATT: Frost Brimley. Frost Brimley is the most
dangerous of forests, by the way. Everyone gets

186
00:11:26,755 --> 00:11:36,490
diabetes. Sorry. Somewhere the sphinx exists in
the Frostweald, which the nameless mate to Osysa,

187
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:43,417
the gynosphinx you met in Vasselheim, sent you to
go seek out this information. Upon going to the

188
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:48,372
town of Westruun to the north, it had been
partially destroyed by the black dragon Umbrasyl,

189
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:54,961
and in its absence had been taken over by what
seems to be Grog's roving barbarian herd.

190
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:56,082
TRAVIS: Dicks.

191
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,073
LAURA: Total dicks.

192
00:11:57,073 --> 00:12:02,487
MATT: They currently sit on the throne of the town
of Westruun and have made some sort of accord with

193
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:07,384
the dragon where they can both simultaneously rule
that area as long as they continually provide

194
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:13,855
goods, gold, and whatever they can procure from
those who live within the city still. Deciding to

195
00:12:13,855 --> 00:12:20,498
continue south, the party made their way into the
ever-frozen forest of the Frostweald. You stumbled

196
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:26,230
upon a small hive of basilisks that surrounded an
obelisk of Ioun, which gave you your first clue as

197
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:32,436
to the location where this sphinx could be found.
You battled the basilisks, destroyed their

198
00:12:32,436 --> 00:12:38,457
underground hive, or at least the exit from it,
via Fireballs and other such stone wall endeavors.

199
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:44,659
Found amongst the stone ruins of previous victims
of the basilisks, you found most of Tyriok

200
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:52,063
Gadsworth, the wandering cartographer, now missing
a portion of his right arm. However, he is

201
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:55,877
restored and alive, which is much better than how
he was before and is currently leading you guys

202
00:12:55,877 --> 00:13:02,529
towards a camp of orcs, supposedly nearby, as some
of the survivors of Westruun's destruction were

203
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:08,814
camping far south and some were being captured by
this roving orc camp. So you guys have just

204
00:13:08,814 --> 00:13:16,080
stepped away from the obelisk and the remains of
these basilisks you've slaughtered. As Tyriok

205
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:21,229
leads you guys from where he last saw-- at least
where he saw some roving orcs before he found

206
00:13:21,229 --> 00:13:28,696
himself turned to stone in that previous area. As
you travel along, the cold midday air of this

207
00:13:28,696 --> 00:13:34,302
forest, there's no wind. It's very still and very
quiet, which is unsettling in a place that's so

208
00:13:34,302 --> 00:13:39,399
out and open in nature. Your boots are crunching
through the snow, step after step, but you're

209
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:44,559
still being as careful and as quiet as you can,
moving along. Tyriok is shivering in the cold and

210
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,902
one of you manages to pull out one of your extra
blankets you have in the Bag of Holding to keep him

211
00:13:48,902 --> 00:13:57,724
from going into hypothermia. You guys press on for
about ten minutes or so, and he's trying to look

212
00:13:57,724 --> 00:14:02,895
around and look at the placement of the sun, look
at different areas that he'd seen within the

213
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:10,919
forest and he's thinking to himself. "All right, so
I recognize that mountain spire, time

214
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:17,565
"of the day, that way is north, west. Follow me!"
And he continues to lead you in that direction.

215
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,824
LAURA: And all of that with just a stump.

216
00:14:19,824 --> 00:14:21,766
MATT: Yes. You're terrible.

217
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:24,652
TRAVIS: Tyriok, do you have a weapon on you?

218
00:14:24,652 --> 00:14:30,872
MATT: "The best weapon I have is right here."

219
00:14:30,872 --> 00:14:36,609
TRAVIS: Yeah, right, on your way, lad. (whispers)
He's going to die first.

220
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:41,744
MATT: He's trouncing through the snow, little bit
ahead, stopping, looking about, before you

221
00:14:41,744 --> 00:14:44,407
realize that he's a huge target, he's making a lot
of noise.

222
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:47,436
MARISHA: Didn't we discuss sending him home?

223
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:49,851
LAURA: No, he had to show us where the orcs were.

224
00:14:49,851 --> 00:14:51,951
TRAVIS: Yeah, I said he shouldn't come, but no--

225
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:56,060
LAURA: Did I cast Pass Without a Trace on us
before we headed out?

226
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:00,645
MATT: You cast it before the battle. I don't
recall if you cast it afterwards.

227
00:15:00,645 --> 00:15:03,885
LAURA: Then I'll cast it again so that he's
incorporated in it and I think we should try to

228
00:15:03,885 --> 00:15:05,087
stealth it.

229
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:06,287
MATT: Okay.

230
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:07,966
TRAVIS: You going to tell him?

231
00:15:07,966 --> 00:15:11,002
LAURA: Hey. Hey, Wonderbrain.

232
00:15:11,002 --> 00:15:13,072
MATT: "Yes?"

233
00:15:13,072 --> 00:15:17,662
LAURA: I think it would be smart if we moved as
quietly as possible.

234
00:15:17,662 --> 00:15:25,537
MATT: "Why, that's what I was doing. Perhaps I
should stand in the back, then, if you guys want

235
00:15:25,537 --> 00:15:33,773
"to go... Loosely that way, about 300 paces to the
right of the second stone you see with the large

236
00:15:33,773 --> 00:15:39,382
"outcropping that looks like a gorilla's face,
and then continue. I'll guide you from back here."

237
00:15:39,382 --> 00:15:41,017
TRAVIS: Yeah, that sounds legit.

238
00:15:41,017 --> 00:15:42,260
MATT: He steps to the back.

239
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:47,474
LAURA: You know, keep a distance. When you hear no
more fighting, it's probably safe. Probably.

240
00:15:47,474 --> 00:15:49,169
MATT: "Okay, okay."

241
00:15:49,169 --> 00:15:54,232
LIAM: I walk up alongside him and say, listen, I
know you're not used to weaponry, but take this,

242
00:15:54,232 --> 00:15:58,950
please. It's a loaner. And I take my Keen Dagger
and I stick it in his hand.

243
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:02,357
LAURA: What? No, don't-- I take it back and I give
another dagger to him.

244
00:16:02,357 --> 00:16:09,436
LIAM: I give him the Keen Dagger and say, hold
this. It's a loner. It's very sharp. Be careful

245
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:14,745
with it, all right? If you get caught on your own,
stab. That's all you got to do, is stab.

246
00:16:14,745 --> 00:16:16,387
TALIESIN: Stab the other person, not yourself.

247
00:16:16,387 --> 00:16:18,864
MATT: His eyes don't leave the blade and he goes,
"Okay."

248
00:16:18,864 --> 00:16:22,956
LAURA: Don't accidentally stab yourself because I
think it sucks your life energy out of you.

249
00:16:22,956 --> 00:16:24,462
LIAM: That is not what that does.

250
00:16:24,462 --> 00:16:26,616
LAURA: Yes it does, it definitely sucks your
life.

251
00:16:26,616 --> 00:16:28,236
MATT: Make a deception check.

252
00:16:28,236 --> 00:16:30,895
LIAM: At a disadvantage since I contradicted
her?

253
00:16:30,895 --> 00:16:34,165
LAURA: 25.

254
00:16:34,165 --> 00:16:35,607
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

255
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:37,661
LIAM: That's another knife I have.

256
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:38,667
TRAVIS: Oh really?

257
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:39,504
LIAM: Yes.

258
00:16:39,504 --> 00:16:41,230
LAURA: Oh!

259
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,617
TRAVIS: That's a giant die.

260
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:44,562
LAURA: It's not above 25.

261
00:16:44,562 --> 00:16:46,072
LIAM: 15. It's 15.

262
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:50,994
MATT: He goes, "Perhaps this is best suited for
someone who knows how to wield such dark powers."

263
00:16:50,994 --> 00:16:55,105
LAURA: I think you are so right. And I'll take
that from you. And in exchange, I will give you

264
00:16:55,105 --> 00:16:57,868
this wonderful opal dagger that I have on my
person.

265
00:16:57,868 --> 00:17:00,324
MATT: "Oh. This is more my speed."

266
00:17:00,324 --> 00:17:01,634
LAURA: Still very sharp.

267
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:04,101
TRAVIS: You know what that one does? It makes you
infertile.

268
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:08,746
LIAM: Give me this, you fucking hoarder. What's
the matter with you? What are you--

269
00:17:08,746 --> 00:17:14,544
TRAVIS: Yeah, can you feel it in your little bits
rumbling? They're all going to sleep <i>forever</i>.

270
00:17:14,544 --> 00:17:20,601
MATT: "Perhaps you have a third or fourth dagger I
can try."

271
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:22,779
LAURA: What? What did he just tell you? I wasn't
paying attention.

272
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:24,200
TRAVIS: Look, I'm a man of the truth.

273
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,624
LAURA: He's lying. He always lies, don't pay any
attention to him. You're safe with that.

274
00:17:27,624 --> 00:17:33,614
LIAM: I push him off, ten feet away from the
group, and I pull out the same Keen Dagger--

275
00:17:33,614 --> 00:17:34,826
LAURA: Jesus!

276
00:17:34,826 --> 00:17:37,276
LIAM: Here's a different one. This is a normal
dagger.

277
00:17:37,276 --> 00:17:40,224
MATT: "How about I take no dagger and I stay away
from this? You guys are starting to be a little

278
00:17:40,224 --> 00:17:43,523
"weird." And he hands you the secondary dagger and
he puts his one hand up.

279
00:17:43,523 --> 00:17:47,660
LIAM: I just don't want what happened to you before to
happen again, all right? You can even put it in

280
00:17:47,741 --> 00:17:54,179
your belt, just have it. All right? It's a normal
dagger, it's fine. My sister is intimidating.

281
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:57,825
MATT: "To say the least. All right."

282
00:17:57,825 --> 00:18:01,781
MARISHA: Vax, just because he's holding a dagger
doesn't mean he's going to be successful at using it.

283
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:02,775
LIAM: What?

284
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:08,708
MARISHA: You're wasting your time-- never mind.

285
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,461
LIAM: Hold on to it.

286
00:18:10,461 --> 00:18:15,649
MATT: "Okay." As you guys start walking, his eyes
don't leave the blade as he takes each step and

287
00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:18,388
(whoosh).

288
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:22,103
LAURA: And then as he walks away, it poofs back
into his fucking belt.

289
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:25,637
LIAM: No, it doesn't.

290
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:29,831
TRAVIS: All right, so we head towards the
outcropping that looks like a gorilla's face.

291
00:18:29,831 --> 00:18:33,059
MATT: Okay, so I'll have you guys all roll a
perception check, if you could.

292
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:36,346
TRAVIS: Perception check. First one!

293
00:18:36,346 --> 00:18:38,307
MARISHA: Heh, natural 19.

294
00:18:38,307 --> 00:18:42,056
LAURA: I don't see anything at all.

295
00:18:42,056 --> 00:18:42,982
TRAVIS: Ten.

296
00:18:42,982 --> 00:18:44,318
LAURA: One.

297
00:18:44,318 --> 00:18:45,466
LIAM: 22.

298
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:46,564
MARISHA: 29.

299
00:18:46,564 --> 00:18:47,735
TALIESIN: 26.

300
00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:48,592
SAM: Three.

301
00:18:48,592 --> 00:18:50,201
LAURA: Off to the races.

302
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:52,312
MARISHA: No, I'm sorry, 30. 30.

303
00:18:52,312 --> 00:18:53,448
TRAVIS: What?!

304
00:18:53,448 --> 00:18:56,131
MARISHA: I rolled a 19, my Perception's 11.

305
00:18:56,131 --> 00:18:58,197
TALIESIN: I think you notice things and have an
epiphany at that point.

306
00:18:58,197 --> 00:19:04,712
MATT: As you guys are walking, Keyleth shoots her
arms out in a stop motion, and you look off and

307
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:12,651
you can see past the clump of trees, maybe 60 feet
ahead of you guys, two hulking-looking humanoids

308
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:17,785
tromping through the snow, dragging something
behind them. You hear the distant crunch of the

309
00:19:17,785 --> 00:19:24,200
snow and there's shape, but it's darker in the
area where they are in the distance. Can't really

310
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,327
make out a form, but you figure these are probably
orcish in nature based on their gait and their

311
00:19:28,327 --> 00:19:30,047
outline.

312
00:19:30,047 --> 00:19:31,303
LAURA: (whispers) What is it?

313
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:37,772
MARISHA: I look at the group and I go--

314
00:19:37,772 --> 00:19:40,265
TRAVIS: Two deer. Santa Claus.

315
00:19:40,265 --> 00:19:45,402
LAURA: Hello, salute, running away.

316
00:19:45,402 --> 00:19:47,108
SAM: Milking a cow.

317
00:19:47,108 --> 00:19:50,003
LIAM: Cha-cha slide.

318
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:52,397
LAURA: Use your words, Keyleth. Talk.

319
00:19:52,397 --> 00:19:56,589
MARISHA: Okay, okay. it looked like there were two
orcs and they were carrying a body.

320
00:19:56,589 --> 00:19:59,751
LAURA: Are they headed this way?

321
00:19:59,751 --> 00:20:03,687
MARISHA: No, they're headed away from us, correct?
Away, they're going away?

322
00:20:03,687 --> 00:20:05,638
MATT: Eh, parallel, a little bit away.

323
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:08,351
LAURA: So I cast Pass Without a Trace on us, so
should we stealth?

324
00:20:08,351 --> 00:20:10,054
MATT: Have you guys all roll stealth now.

325
00:20:10,054 --> 00:20:11,991
TRAVIS: Still flat grassland, or are there some
trees?

326
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:13,728
MATT: Well, you guys are in the center of the
Frostweald.

327
00:20:13,728 --> 00:20:18,199
So it's relatively thick trees, relative
canopy.

328
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:21,279
TALIESIN: Rolling stealth plus ten.

329
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,553
MARISHA: Thank goodness. 22.

330
00:20:23,553 --> 00:20:24,607
TALIESIN: 26.

331
00:20:24,607 --> 00:20:25,429
SAM: 15.

332
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:26,494
LIAM: 45.

333
00:20:26,494 --> 00:20:27,965
LAURA: 29. What?!

334
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:28,971
TRAVIS: 26.

335
00:20:28,971 --> 00:20:30,874
MARISHA: You got a natural 20?

336
00:20:30,874 --> 00:20:33,823
TRAVIS: 45, holy shit.

337
00:20:33,823 --> 00:20:36,600
TALIESIN: You don't know where you are anymore at
that point.

338
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,939
LIAM: I am one-dimensional.

339
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:39,554
MATT: So what are you guys going to do?

340
00:20:39,554 --> 00:20:40,481
LAURA: He's a dot.

341
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:45,654
TRAVIS: From our previous time in the Frostweald,
we don't recognize any of this terrain

342
00:20:45,654 --> 00:20:46,543
right?

343
00:20:46,543 --> 00:20:50,215
MATT: I mean, you recognize the terrain. It's a
large forest.

344
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:51,864
TRAVIS: No landmarks, no lakes?

345
00:20:51,864 --> 00:20:57,790
MATT: Not nearby, none that you've seen at least.
If you want to go look for that, you could, but--

346
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:02,777
TRAVIS: Are there any paths in front of us, or is
it just trees and intermittent terrain?

347
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:07,291
MATT: If there are paths, they're under so much
snow and relatively fresh snow that's perpetually

348
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:12,943
piled on this region, they're not visible at the
moment. You can occasional hoofprints in the snow

349
00:21:12,943 --> 00:21:15,632
from some wildlife that might live in the vicinity
of the forest.

350
00:21:15,632 --> 00:21:17,954
TRAVIS: Don't you like this terrain?

351
00:21:17,954 --> 00:21:19,194
LAURA: I do.

352
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,582
TRAVIS: Well, so what should we do?

353
00:21:20,582 --> 00:21:29,426
LIAM: We're looking for orcs. They're what we're
looking for. Aren't they going where we want to go?

354
00:21:29,426 --> 00:21:31,567
TALIESIN: Let's pace and slowly approach.

355
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:35,637
LAURA: I like it. Can I search the ground and see
if there are a lot of tracks around? Or is this

356
00:21:35,637 --> 00:21:37,210
like a roaming party?

357
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,660
MATT: From what you can see around, you don't see
any tracks from them specifically in front of you,

358
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:45,949
from where they're travelling, it appears to just
be the two of them right now. They're either

359
00:21:45,949 --> 00:21:50,917
scouts or hunters, and the closer you guys, as you
slowly approach, to get a better view, they're

360
00:21:50,917 --> 00:21:56,560
both dragging what look to be like two boars that
were killed, are currently being dragged by their

361
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,599
legs over their shoulders, leaving a trail of
crimson in the snow behind them.

362
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:02,902
LAURA: I think we should take them out before they
get back to their group.

363
00:22:02,902 --> 00:22:07,872
SAM: Wait. What is our overall goal here? Are we
to slay a bunch of orcs or are we to follow them

364
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,060
somewhere?

365
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,507
LAURA: We're supposed to slay them and stop them
from--

366
00:22:11,507 --> 00:22:15,102
TRAVIS: Number two and then number one. Follow
them and then kill the rest.

367
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:18,563
LIAM: We want to get rid of all of them, so follow
these guys back to the bee's nest and we can take

368
00:22:18,563 --> 00:22:19,275
care of the hive.

369
00:22:19,275 --> 00:22:21,025
SAM: Okay, well let's follow silently.

370
00:22:21,025 --> 00:22:25,859
LIAM: Why don't I go a little bit ahead, you
follow behind by about 50 paces and the rest of

371
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:27,195
the group behind you?

372
00:22:27,195 --> 00:22:29,743
LAURA: But what if we kill them now, we won't have
to fight them--

373
00:22:29,743 --> 00:22:31,384
SAM: Then we won't know where the camp is.

374
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:32,735
LAURA: But I can follow tracks.

375
00:22:32,735 --> 00:22:35,701
SAM: Oh. Can you?

376
00:22:35,701 --> 00:22:37,501
MARISHA: There won't be tracks if they're dead.

377
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:39,545
LIAM: They're not coming from where they're from,
they're going.

378
00:22:39,545 --> 00:22:40,970
SAM: They were just hunting.

379
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,232
LAURA: Fine! Fuck it!

380
00:22:42,232 --> 00:22:43,299
SAM: Let's follow them.

381
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:44,741
MATT: So you guys--

382
00:22:44,741 --> 00:22:45,638
TRAVIS: We follow them.

383
00:22:45,638 --> 00:22:47,524
MATT: Okay, you don't catch up, you follow.

384
00:22:47,524 --> 00:22:49,247
TRAVIS: At a safe distance.

385
00:22:49,247 --> 00:22:54,904
MATT: Okay. So you guys continue moving forward,
watching them as they go, at a far enough

386
00:22:54,904 --> 00:23:06,346
distance. Pike's doing her best to walk behind in
the snow, but it's okay! She's barely moving her

387
00:23:06,346 --> 00:23:09,096
upper body to make sure it's minimal amount of
movement.

388
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:12,542
LIAM: I'm not far ahead, but I'm ahead. I'm like
30 yards ahead.

389
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:18,221
MATT: Yeah. Listening out, you can hear the
occasional laughter, too far away to hear any sort

390
00:23:18,221 --> 00:23:24,166
of language, not that I think you understand or
know the language Orcish, but eventually they come

391
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:31,162
over a hill, and down, and you see it first as you
crest over. You can see there is a small clearing

392
00:23:31,162 --> 00:23:39,362
in the forest of this area, where there are two
tents, what looks to be relatively filth-stained

393
00:23:39,362 --> 00:23:43,727
tents, like they've been used for an extended
period of time, covered in dirt and mud and other

394
00:23:43,727 --> 00:23:49,704
things. You can see a small pile of skinned bodies
to a side of one of the tents.

395
00:23:49,704 --> 00:23:51,431
LAURA: (whispers) Oh! They're definitely bad.

396
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:52,978
SAM: (whispers) I don't know.

397
00:23:52,978 --> 00:23:57,492
MATT: There's a large stump next to it, with a
trail of blood that leads up to it. You can see there are

398
00:23:57,492 --> 00:24:02,926
two small fires that are set in the center of this
area, where they're keeping warm to themselves.

399
00:24:02,926 --> 00:24:07,370
And these bundled-up orcs are sitting around the
fires, drinking. You can see some of them have

400
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:14,422
random silver mugs or cups, some have steins, some
have carved pieces of bark that are used as a

401
00:24:14,422 --> 00:24:22,914
means of drinking. You can see outside of these
tents what appear to be large barrels or casks of

402
00:24:22,914 --> 00:24:28,335
wine or liquor that have been probably raided from
the camp they found outside of the lake. You can

403
00:24:28,335 --> 00:24:32,844
see a couple of them are much larger than the
other orcs. One of them is sitting down by the

404
00:24:32,844 --> 00:24:39,141
fire and is chuckling with the rest. You see to
the back of the camp, there is one that's taking

405
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:43,178
javelins and chucking them up in the air, and
they're arcing through. And every time he chucks

406
00:24:43,178 --> 00:24:48,857
one, you hear a (scared noise), and as soon as you
move to the edge of it, you look over and there is a

407
00:24:48,857 --> 00:24:53,534
young man who's strung up by his torso from one of
the trees and it looks like a few of the orcs are

408
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:57,398
making target practice. They've already hit him
twice. There's one that's sticking out of his

409
00:24:57,398 --> 00:25:01,669
thigh and another one that's embedded itself in
his shoulder, and little trails of blood streaking

410
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:06,455
down, but he is currently strung up like a piñata
and they're having fun with him. You take a moment

411
00:25:06,455 --> 00:25:09,732
as the rest of the group catches up to you on the
edge and you can see there are a few other people

412
00:25:09,732 --> 00:25:17,076
being kept inside the tents right now. One large
orc musters out, adorned in thicker armor than the

413
00:25:17,076 --> 00:25:22,258
rest of them. He has a band across his head with a
big old rough, uncut gem on the front. He starts

414
00:25:22,258 --> 00:25:27,104
barking out orders to a few of them. One of the
larger ones stands up, and he's probably a good

415
00:25:27,104 --> 00:25:31,548
foot taller than the other orcs, lumbers to the
back of the two tents and you can see there are

416
00:25:31,548 --> 00:25:39,334
two bears that are currently chained up to the
back. He reaches over and grabs one of the skinned

417
00:25:39,334 --> 00:25:43,836
bodies from the side of the tent and throws it to
the two bears and they immediately start tearing

418
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:47,940
it apart and eating it. At this point the rest of
the party catches up to you.

419
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,224
LIAM: Okay, so I saw that.

420
00:25:49,224 --> 00:25:50,260
MATT: Yes.

421
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,155
LIAM: Okay. But they're still a ways off, right?

422
00:25:52,155 --> 00:25:55,611
MATT: In fact, I could probably show you now.
Since you have--

423
00:25:55,611 --> 00:25:58,366
SAM: Whoa! It's a cozy camp.

424
00:25:58,366 --> 00:26:00,091
LAURA: Oh my god, look at that camp!

425
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,064
SAM: There's fire, there's bears.

426
00:26:02,064 --> 00:26:04,461
LAURA: Where are the wine barrels?

427
00:26:04,461 --> 00:26:08,493
MATT: The barrels are right there, right there,
and right there.

428
00:26:08,493 --> 00:26:10,166
SAM: Oh, there's the guy hanging up in the tree!

429
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:11,376
MARISHA: Where, where, where?

430
00:26:11,376 --> 00:26:14,106
Can you point out those barrels one more
time?

431
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,009
MATT: There, there, and there.

432
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:18,368
LAURA: So next to the tents that the prisoners are
being kept in.

433
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,458
MATT: Yes.

434
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:21,019
SAM: Okay. We have options, people.

435
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:22,336
MATT: They haven't noticed you.

436
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,082
LIAM: How far back are we?

437
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:31,456
MATT: You are probably back here, a good 60 feet
outside of the outskirts of the camp. They don't

438
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:35,518
seem to have noticed your approach and this is
entirely however you guys want to approach this.

439
00:26:35,518 --> 00:26:37,243
LIAM: All right, well, I turn back to the group.

440
00:26:37,243 --> 00:26:39,439
LAURA: What time of day is it?

441
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:41,080
MATT: It's mid-afternoon.

442
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:48,134
SAM: Can we rest? Are we rested? Yeah, we had a
night in the-- wait, no. We just killed those--

443
00:26:48,134 --> 00:26:51,934
MATT: No, you haven't rested since the basilisks.

444
00:26:51,934 --> 00:26:54,847
SAM: Okay, so we're down a couple spells, or
whatever.

445
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,722
MARISHA: Yeah, but I'm full on hit points. Is
anyone hurt?

446
00:26:57,722 --> 00:26:59,825
LAURA: Well, I'm a little hurt.

447
00:26:59,825 --> 00:27:01,251
MATT: It was a bump in the road, the basilisks.

448
00:27:01,251 --> 00:27:09,740
SAM: Yeah. Okay. Hey, oi! So do I create a
distraction while you go around back? Do we go in

449
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:14,273
guns blazing? What's the plan? I can distract.

450
00:27:14,273 --> 00:27:17,494
LAURA: I think it would be good to create a
distraction. We go in, save the prisoners and then

451
00:27:17,494 --> 00:27:18,885
take out the camp.

452
00:27:18,885 --> 00:27:23,135
SAM: So a distraction that would get everyone to
run towards me and ignore you?

453
00:27:23,135 --> 00:27:24,498
LAURA: And then we can stealth down--

454
00:27:24,498 --> 00:27:27,509
LIAM: Can we go around the sides--

455
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:28,733
MARISHA: Flank them?

456
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:30,354
LIAM: Flank them ahead of time.

457
00:27:30,354 --> 00:27:33,549
Scanlan, you create a distraction--

458
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:34,827
MARISHA: As they're running--

459
00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:36,305
LIAM: -- closer to here?

460
00:27:36,305 --> 00:27:37,143
SAM: Sure.

461
00:27:37,143 --> 00:27:39,493
LIAM: You want to get that guy down to the treeline
and get the people out.

462
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:41,700
SAM: Sure. I'll draw them away from the tents.

463
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:48,704
LAURA: Okay. And then, once everyone's clear, we
bring them back and kill them all? Or what?

464
00:27:48,704 --> 00:27:54,196
LIAM: Well, this may be it for orcs? This could be
all of them, or it could be just a forward camp,

465
00:27:54,196 --> 00:27:55,951
so we need to keep one alive.

466
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:57,364
LAURA: And find out.

467
00:27:57,364 --> 00:28:00,247
LIAM: And find out if this is the end of it, or if
there's more.

468
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:01,209
TALIESIN: That's fair.

469
00:28:01,209 --> 00:28:02,627
TRAVIS: Good thinking.

470
00:28:02,627 --> 00:28:04,772
LAURA: How do we get all the prisoners out very
quickly?

471
00:28:04,772 --> 00:28:11,290
TALIESIN: You have knives. You could cut your way
through the back of the tent.

472
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:14,618
LAURA: Scanlan, could you potentially put all the
people in the door?

473
00:28:14,618 --> 00:28:24,473
SAM: No. That is for my recreational use only.
Also takes a minute to cast.

474
00:28:24,473 --> 00:28:31,790
MARISHA: Well, Scanlan can create a distraction, I
can possibly take a few people out with my ranged

475
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,859
spells along the way.

476
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:40,960
LAURA: I'm saying get the prisoners safe so that
nobody's running blindly into the forest.

477
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,639
LIAM: I've lost track of all you've done in the
past 24 hours. Could you send everybody through a

478
00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:49,273
tree, even back to where their people are?

479
00:28:49,273 --> 00:28:50,564
MARISHA: Not today.

480
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:55,504
LAURA: What if you spent some time, a minute,
creating your mansion, you have a little door

481
00:28:55,504 --> 00:29:01,216
here. Once you've created a distraction, we can
all run up and put them in the door and then we

482
00:29:01,216 --> 00:29:03,918
fight. And then we get the people out of the
mansion.

483
00:29:03,918 --> 00:29:05,378
LIAM: Yes, that's good. That's good.

484
00:29:05,378 --> 00:29:07,254
SAM: Interesting idea. It's an interesting idea.

485
00:29:07,254 --> 00:29:08,590
TRAVIS: I kind of like it.

486
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,877
SAM: I like it too.

487
00:29:09,877 --> 00:29:14,245
LIAM: They can go down to the workout room, so
they don't soil the other chambers.

488
00:29:14,245 --> 00:29:17,675
SAM: It's not concentration. I mean, it's
concentration for a minute, but then after it's

489
00:29:17,675 --> 00:29:18,704
cast, it's okay.

490
00:29:18,704 --> 00:29:20,609
MATT: Once it's cast, it's 24 hours that door
stays there.

491
00:29:20,609 --> 00:29:22,677
TRAVIS: Yeah, all your little Mr. Meeseeks will
take care of them.

492
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:26,517
SAM: But we still have to get them out of the camp
and into the door, unless I make the door in the

493
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:27,577
camp.

494
00:29:27,577 --> 00:29:31,626
TALIESIN: Make the door, make the door at the back
of the camp. And that way, we can run them out the

495
00:29:31,626 --> 00:29:32,691
back of the tents.

496
00:29:32,691 --> 00:29:34,046
LAURA: Not near the bears.

497
00:29:34,046 --> 00:29:38,447
LIAM: You need to go full Burt Reynolds out in
front of that camp and get the bulk of them

498
00:29:38,447 --> 00:29:39,681
running towards you.

499
00:29:39,681 --> 00:29:40,777
SAM: I can't do both.

500
00:29:40,777 --> 00:29:41,955
TALIESIN: Make the door first.

501
00:29:41,955 --> 00:29:43,540
TRAVIS: No, no, hey look. I'm good for a
distraction.

502
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,782
LIAM: Blow your shawm.

503
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:51,412
SAM: I'm fine with distractions, but I can't go to
the back of the camp and set a door and to the

504
00:29:51,412 --> 00:29:52,977
front of the camp and draw them out.

505
00:29:52,977 --> 00:30:00,795
MARISHA: Let Scanlan handle-- I almost called him
Scandal, which is still appropriate. Let Scanlan

506
00:30:00,795 --> 00:30:02,994
handle the door, I can handle the distraction.

507
00:30:02,994 --> 00:30:03,946
LAURA: Okay.

508
00:30:03,946 --> 00:30:04,985
LIAM and TALIESIN: All right

509
00:30:04,985 --> 00:30:06,477
LAURA: All right, so we sneak around to the back.

510
00:30:06,477 --> 00:30:07,752
SAM: I'm really good at distractions.

511
00:30:07,752 --> 00:30:09,836
MARISHA: You are, you're incredibly good at
distractions.

512
00:30:09,836 --> 00:30:13,198
LIAM: But you're the only one who can make a
Hefner mansion out of thin air.

513
00:30:13,198 --> 00:30:17,942
SAM: So I'm to sneak in and make a door and await
further instructions?

514
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,842
LIAM: We'll all go together.

515
00:30:19,842 --> 00:30:22,063
LAURA: We'll make the door far enough away.

516
00:30:22,063 --> 00:30:28,704
LIAM: Wait, Keyleth does the distraction. As soon
as she goes, you go. So once those guys start

517
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:29,699
running towards her--

518
00:30:29,699 --> 00:30:31,071
SAM: How far away are we?

519
00:30:31,071 --> 00:30:36,916
MATT: You guys are probably about 60 feet away
from the far outside of the campline, so around

520
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:43,385
this ring here, just outside of where the table
edges are.

521
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:46,820
SAM: But we're talking like 150 feet? 200 feet?

522
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:51,702
MATT: You're probably closer to about 60 feet away
right now, you can move for--

523
00:30:51,702 --> 00:30:58,348
SAM: Okay, well, we're fine. I can make the
door from 300 feet away. So we're fine. So I can

524
00:30:58,348 --> 00:31:00,288
make the door right now before we do anything.

525
00:31:00,288 --> 00:31:01,569
LAURA: Do it, make the door!

526
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:02,921
SAM: Except there's going to be a glowing door in
their camp.

527
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:05,397
LAURA: Make the door behind one of those trees.

528
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:10,938
SAM: All right. Okay, I'm going to go ahead and do
it.

529
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:12,166
TRAVIS: Yeah, fuck it, just do it.

530
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:15,448
LAURA: Get ready to do a distraction right fucking
now.

531
00:31:15,448 --> 00:31:19,950
LIAM: But you know what you're doing, right? Wait!
Let's get in position! You and I can do a lot more

532
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:23,580
hurt to these guys if we're closer to the position
we have to go?

533
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,237
SAM: All right, flank around, flank around. It's
going to take me a minute to cast the spell. You

534
00:31:26,237 --> 00:31:27,632
have a minute to get into position.

535
00:31:27,632 --> 00:31:31,495
MATT: So who all's flanking around? All right, so
the twins and Percy, where are you guys going?

536
00:31:31,495 --> 00:31:35,758
LIAM: I'll take the long way around, this way.

537
00:31:35,758 --> 00:31:37,189
MATT: Over here?

538
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:37,944
TRAVIS: Far side?

539
00:31:37,944 --> 00:31:38,868
LIAM: Yeah.

540
00:31:38,868 --> 00:31:39,879
MATT: Okay, so.

541
00:31:39,879 --> 00:31:42,944
LIAM: With an eye for the shithead who's
tormenting that guy in the tree.

542
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:44,067
MATT: All right, are you going with him?

543
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:45,951
LAURA: No, I'm staying on the other side.

544
00:31:45,951 --> 00:31:47,578
MATT: Okay, Percy, you're going with Vax?

545
00:31:47,578 --> 00:31:52,218
TALIESIN: I'm going to go, actually, right over
here. I'm going to hide over here and I'm going to

546
00:31:52,218 --> 00:31:54,388
try and get a bead on the guy on the tree.

547
00:31:54,388 --> 00:31:57,717
MATT: Okay, easy enough. You get a bead on him, in
the outskirts there.

548
00:31:57,717 --> 00:31:59,484
TRAVIS: Pike and I will go with Vax.

549
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,721
SAM: Oh, she's not a good sneaker.

550
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:04,516
TRAVIS: Oh no, you're right, she should stay put.
You're right.

551
00:32:04,516 --> 00:32:06,266
MATT: You're going to be right there.

552
00:32:06,266 --> 00:32:10,289
LAURA: Charge in after the distraction.

553
00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:12,679
MATT: So Grog, where are you going?

554
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:13,794
TRAVIS: I'll go with Vax.

555
00:32:13,794 --> 00:32:18,705
MATT: Vax? All right, so you make your way around.
Keeping your guys' existing stealth checks, which

556
00:32:18,705 --> 00:32:21,043
were okay.

557
00:32:21,043 --> 00:32:22,560
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was a 25.

558
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,894
LIAM: 45.

559
00:32:23,894 --> 00:32:29,225
MATT: Okay.

560
00:32:29,225 --> 00:32:39,330
LAURA: Oh, Pike did come? We said Pike could stay,
because she's not stealthy.

561
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:47,611
MATT: Not stealthy. Okay then. She stays there. So
Pike's going to go-- Scanlan, you're moving back?

562
00:32:47,611 --> 00:32:49,013
Where are you going?

563
00:32:49,013 --> 00:32:53,925
SAM: I'm staying next to Keyleth because I can do
this from a range.

564
00:32:53,925 --> 00:32:56,812
MATT: Where do you guys want to go-- Keyleth, for
this distraction?

565
00:32:56,812 --> 00:32:58,271
MARISHA: Where's Scanlan?

566
00:32:58,271 --> 00:32:59,877
SAM: Wait, don't do the distraction yet! I haven't
set the--

567
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:02,392
MATT: Where do you guys want to set up for the
distraction?

568
00:33:02,392 --> 00:33:04,658
MARISHA: Where did you go, Scanlan?

569
00:33:04,658 --> 00:33:06,434
SAM: I'm right next to you. We want to do it--

570
00:33:06,434 --> 00:33:10,335
MARISHA: Yeah, we want to do it towards us.

571
00:33:10,335 --> 00:33:12,380
SAM: We want to distract around here.

572
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,979
LAURA: And then run the other direction.

573
00:33:13,979 --> 00:33:14,983
MARISHA: Yes.

574
00:33:14,983 --> 00:33:17,238
MATT: All right, so you guys are set up right
about there.

575
00:33:17,238 --> 00:33:19,687
MARISHA: No, that's where we wanted-- Put us
more--

576
00:33:19,687 --> 00:33:22,366
SAM: No, he knows. We're back right now, but
that's where we will end up.

577
00:33:22,366 --> 00:33:26,061
MATT: You're further back. I can only put you so
far away from the table edge.

578
00:33:26,061 --> 00:33:27,632
MARISHA: No, that's good, that's good, that's
good.

579
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:33,913
MATT: All right, Pike's going to stay up with you,
since you have the bead right now and if worse

580
00:33:33,913 --> 00:33:42,855
comes to worst, she can help rush in and try and
help at that point. All right, so who's doing what?

581
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:45,011
SAM: I'm going to start casting the door.

582
00:33:45,011 --> 00:33:46,300
MATT: All right.

583
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:51,228
SAM: And I'm going to do it back behind camp, on
the treeline or whatever.

584
00:33:51,228 --> 00:33:53,869
MATT: Okay, back far this way?

585
00:33:53,869 --> 00:33:56,593
SAM: You know, just out of eyeshot of them.

586
00:33:56,593 --> 00:34:00,260
MATT: Okay, I'll put this little dice on the
corner to represent where the door is.

587
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,933
LAURA: Yeah, that's good, that's good.

588
00:34:01,933 --> 00:34:03,430
LIAM: I turn to Grog.

589
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,359
TRAVIS: Yeah?

590
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:07,547
LIAM: I'm moving a little closer, just a bit, stay
there.

591
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:08,985
TRAVIS: Come with you?

592
00:34:08,985 --> 00:34:11,181
LIAM: The opposite of that.

593
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:13,430
TRAVIS: Go away from you?

594
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:20,165
LIAM: This is your spot, this is your spot! And I
creep towards the trees, a tree closest to me, so

595
00:34:20,165 --> 00:34:23,195
I can get closer. Which is the orc that's throwing
the javelins on that map?

596
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:25,087
MATT: These two right here are taking turns.

597
00:34:25,087 --> 00:34:26,434
LIAM: Okay.

598
00:34:26,434 --> 00:34:34,781
MATT: At this point, you hear another (grunt,
scream), and then some (condescending laughter).

599
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,125
Oh, moving up to here?

600
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:38,929
LIAM: The other tree closer to you.

601
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:39,876
MATT: Right there?

602
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:41,784
LIAM: Yeah, and I'll hold there.

603
00:34:41,784 --> 00:34:44,016
MATT: All right. Who's up next? Who's doing what?

604
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:45,490
TALIESIN: Waiting for the distraction.

605
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:51,598
SAM: Do you want me to go in and you can cast
something? I'll get their attention and you can

606
00:34:51,598 --> 00:34:52,737
cast something?

607
00:34:52,737 --> 00:34:53,841
MARISHA: Sure.

608
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:54,757
SAM: Okay.

609
00:34:54,757 --> 00:34:57,576
MARISHA: Can I have a Monster Manual?

610
00:34:57,576 --> 00:34:59,310
MATT: For what?

611
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,418
MARISHA: Conjure Woodland Beings?

612
00:35:01,418 --> 00:35:03,725
LIAM: Do you want the app?

613
00:35:03,725 --> 00:35:04,849
MARISHA: Maybe.

614
00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:09,189
SAM: There's not many that you can conjure. It's
pixies and little things.

615
00:35:09,189 --> 00:35:11,258
LAURA: Yeah, that's little creatures.

616
00:35:11,258 --> 00:35:14,056
SAM: It's okay, she knows what she's doing. No,
she doesn't.

617
00:35:14,056 --> 00:35:16,378
MARISHA: Well, I can conjure a bunch of little
creatures.

618
00:35:16,378 --> 00:35:18,013
LIAM: You can search. Search!

619
00:35:18,013 --> 00:35:20,685
TRAVIS: If you make a bunch of David the Gnomes--

620
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:24,761
LAURA: Seriously, like a giant scorpion would be
probably pretty cool.

621
00:35:24,761 --> 00:35:30,419
LIAM: Fire elemental? Big, bright fire elemental?

622
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:39,050
MARISHA: Yeah, but then it wouldn't be me. It'd be
something else that's not me that I can control?

623
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:43,772
MATT: Percy's taking the bead, waiting for the
distraction.

624
00:35:43,772 --> 00:35:45,011
TALIESIN: Just do it!

625
00:35:45,011 --> 00:35:46,523
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to say Conjure Woodland
Beings.

626
00:35:46,523 --> 00:35:47,660
MATT: What are you conjuring?

627
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,927
MARISHA: I don't know.

628
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:50,183
MATT: You have to know what you're doing.

629
00:35:50,183 --> 00:35:52,631
MARISHA: Well, that's what I'm trying to figure
out. You know, there's not a list of what you can

630
00:35:52,631 --> 00:35:53,784
conjure in the book.

631
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:54,932
SAM: No, there's not.

632
00:35:54,932 --> 00:35:58,796
MARISHA: And it's very unfortunate. And it's some
kind of fey creature. So what's a fey creature

633
00:35:58,796 --> 00:36:02,488
that's a challenge rating of two that would make
sense? That's really scary?

634
00:36:02,488 --> 00:36:03,990
LAURA: Fairies?

635
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:08,129
MARISHA: Or I can also summon like eight fairies
if they're a low enough, you know--

636
00:36:08,129 --> 00:36:14,815
MATT: I hate conjuration spells, by the way guys,
so you all know. The worst spells in the whole game.

637
00:36:14,815 --> 00:36:18,815
SAM: I will say this, to be fair to Marisha, the
spell does say, your DM will have a list of the

638
00:36:18,815 --> 00:36:19,989
creatures.

639
00:36:19,989 --> 00:36:22,114
(laughter)

640
00:36:22,114 --> 00:36:22,864
MATT: Does it really?

641
00:36:22,864 --> 00:36:24,002
SAM: It does, at the end of the spell.

642
00:36:24,002 --> 00:36:25,373
MATT: Fuck that spell.

643
00:36:25,373 --> 00:36:27,809
(laughter)

644
00:36:27,809 --> 00:36:29,778
MARISHA: Yeah it says the DM will have the
statistics.

645
00:36:29,778 --> 00:36:31,860
SAM: It says the DM will have the creatures.

646
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:36,247
MATT: Fuck that spell. Conjuration needs to die.
No, conjuration's great, when you're not the DM.

647
00:36:36,247 --> 00:36:39,578
TRAVIS: You don't know me, you don't know what
lists I have.

648
00:36:39,578 --> 00:36:41,190
MATT: How about some dryads?

649
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,359
MARISHA: Dryads?

650
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:43,779
MATT: We'll go see what their challenge rating
is.

651
00:36:43,779 --> 00:36:45,036
MARISHA: That sounds cool.

652
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,160
MATT: Past the devils.

653
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,253
LIAM: I'll give you level-two challenge rating.

654
00:36:48,253 --> 00:36:57,672
MATT: And no, we're not doing the whole pixies
Polymorph. That's so dumb. Not even going to lie.

655
00:36:57,672 --> 00:36:59,334
MARISHA: Challenge rating of two.

656
00:36:59,334 --> 00:37:00,931
MATT: Challenge rating of one.

657
00:37:00,931 --> 00:37:04,151
MARISHA: It's got to be a fey. Oh, it only has a
challenge rating of one?

658
00:37:04,151 --> 00:37:05,793
LAURA and LIAM: Centaur!

659
00:37:05,793 --> 00:37:07,197
MARISHA: What are centaurs?

660
00:37:07,197 --> 00:37:08,818
SAM: Centaurs are not fey, are they?

661
00:37:08,818 --> 00:37:09,842
MARISHA: Apparently.

662
00:37:09,842 --> 00:37:10,788
LAURA: They are!

663
00:37:10,788 --> 00:37:11,993
LIAM: Green dragon wyrmling!

664
00:37:11,993 --> 00:37:13,254
TRAVIS: I'm getting bored.

665
00:37:13,254 --> 00:37:15,470
MATT: I don't think centaurs are fey.

666
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,019
MARISHA: Okay. Well then, let's do two dryads.

667
00:37:17,019 --> 00:37:18,856
MATT: Two dryads. You can do up to two challenge
rating--

668
00:37:18,856 --> 00:37:21,590
TALIESIN: (sings) Five gold rings!

669
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:24,477
MARISHA: Two triads. Dryads. I don't know what it
is.

670
00:37:24,477 --> 00:37:26,096
LIAM: Will o' the wisp!

671
00:37:26,096 --> 00:37:28,235
MARISHA: Two dryads.

672
00:37:28,235 --> 00:37:31,047
MATT: We will say here, two dryads. Where are they
going?

673
00:37:31,047 --> 00:37:32,850
MARISHA: Right in where--

674
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:36,229
SAM: Front and center.

675
00:37:36,229 --> 00:37:38,615
MARISHA: Thank you. Yep, here. Ish.

676
00:37:38,615 --> 00:37:39,920
SAM: See this, Matt?

677
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,323
MARISHA: Here. No, there.

678
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:42,429
MATT: Right there?

679
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:44,422
MARISHA: Yeah that's a little out. And Scanlan and
I are far back.

680
00:37:44,422 --> 00:37:57,138
MATT: Now, suddenly the dryads pop into being and
these two humanoid green nature entities that look

681
00:37:57,138 --> 00:38:02,080
humanoid but are covered with leaves and their
skin has the texture of bark in places. Beautiful,

682
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:08,751
wistful, both appear, summoned out of the ether
and land on the snow.

683
00:38:08,751 --> 00:38:10,074
LIAM: Crunch.

684
00:38:10,074 --> 00:38:15,785
MATT: The ground gives out from under them, they
both go, (screams) and fall into a pit here.

685
00:38:15,785 --> 00:38:17,263
SAM: Oh shit!

686
00:38:17,263 --> 00:38:21,058
MARISHA: See, aren't you glad that wasn't me?

687
00:38:21,058 --> 00:38:22,562
SAM: Yeah. Good job.

688
00:38:22,562 --> 00:38:24,081
LIAM: Couldn't have gone with the will o' the wisp.

689
00:38:24,081 --> 00:38:25,392
TRAVIS: A pit?

690
00:38:25,392 --> 00:38:27,082
LIAM: They would have floated right above it.

691
00:38:27,082 --> 00:38:34,854
MATT: This whole section here has now crumpled
below. The dryads, however, have to make a save.

692
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,782
LAURA: Oh my god.

693
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:38,887
MATT: One of them saves.

694
00:38:38,887 --> 00:38:41,539
LIAM: But that wasn't us!

695
00:38:41,539 --> 00:38:42,956
MARISHA: That wasn't us!

696
00:38:42,956 --> 00:38:45,667
MATT: That wasn't you guys. Like right there?
Okay!

697
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:47,913
MARISHA: Wasn't me! It's all I care about!

698
00:38:47,913 --> 00:38:49,796
MATT: All right.

699
00:38:49,796 --> 00:38:54,198
TALIESIN: This is the most Douglas Adams beginning
of a fight ever.

700
00:38:54,198 --> 00:39:00,711
MATT: One dryad dies a horrible screaming death.
(screams) And the other one you hear is breathing

701
00:39:00,711 --> 00:39:02,783
heavily from the inside right now.

702
00:39:02,783 --> 00:39:08,115
MARISHA: Keyleth is standing at the edge of the
forest going--

703
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:16,752
MATT: At which point, a bunch of the orcs turn
around. I need both of you guys to-- let's see,

704
00:39:16,752 --> 00:39:19,408
because they're making active perception. What was
your stealth check, Sam?

705
00:39:19,408 --> 00:39:21,704
SAM: 15, but it doesn't matter. I'm walking
forward.

706
00:39:21,704 --> 00:39:22,974
MATT: (chuckles) Okay.

707
00:39:22,974 --> 00:39:33,434
SAM: I'm going to cast the Resilient Sphere on
myself. And I'm going to roll into camp. Hamster-style.

708
00:39:33,434 --> 00:39:35,588
MARISHA: Wait, can I go with you a little bit?

709
00:39:35,588 --> 00:39:36,628
SAM: Don't.

710
00:39:36,628 --> 00:39:38,992
MARISHA: Can I do a thing with him?

711
00:39:38,992 --> 00:39:41,300
TRAVIS: If he says don't, then--

712
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,630
LAURA: Then probably don't.

713
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,828
LIAM: No, let him do his thing. It's marble
madness, everybody.

714
00:39:44,828 --> 00:40:08,303
SAM: I'm going to start singing to get their
attention. (sings 'Tro-lo-lo')

715
00:40:08,303 --> 00:40:10,168
MARISHA: Just avoid the pit!

716
00:40:10,168 --> 00:40:15,464
MATT: All right. All 60 feet, you avoid the pit,
you roll around, all the orcs look over. "Huh?

717
00:40:15,464 --> 00:40:21,874
"Stupid gnome!"

718
00:40:21,874 --> 00:40:23,486
SAM: Very stupid.

719
00:40:23,486 --> 00:40:26,251
MATT: Initiative has now kicked in; I need
everyone to roll initiative. (laughs)

720
00:40:26,251 --> 00:40:29,174
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

721
00:40:29,174 --> 00:40:30,702
MATT: Jesus Christ.

722
00:40:30,702 --> 00:40:32,592
MARISHA: Oh, that's a good roll!

723
00:40:32,592 --> 00:40:33,999
MATT: All right, so--

724
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:37,063
TALIESIN: Oh, hell yes.

725
00:40:37,063 --> 00:40:41,016
MARISHA: Spent all that time figuring out what I
was going to do and then they fell in a crack.

726
00:40:41,016 --> 00:40:44,760
SAM: You did great! You exposed the trap! You
saved--

727
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,140
LAURA: It's true!

728
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,325
TALIESIN: If you'd conjured a will-o'-wisp, it
would have been you in that hole.

729
00:40:48,325 --> 00:40:51,440
SAM: If I had just gone out, I would have fallen
in the hole!

730
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,206
LIAM: It's all right, Wendy will draw some dryads
falling into the spikes--

731
00:40:55,206 --> 00:40:57,331
MATT: Initiative orders. 25 to 20?

732
00:40:57,331 --> 00:40:58,377
LIAM: 25.

733
00:40:58,377 --> 00:40:59,299
TALIESIN: 24.

734
00:40:59,299 --> 00:41:00,359
MATT: Whoa.

735
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:01,484
MARISHA: 21.

736
00:41:01,484 --> 00:41:05,241
MATT: All right, 25. So we have Vax. 24, Percy.

737
00:41:05,241 --> 00:41:07,773
MARISHA: 21.

738
00:41:07,773 --> 00:41:09,827
TRAVIS: And 20.

739
00:41:09,827 --> 00:41:12,097
MATT: Keyleth and Grog. Oh man.

740
00:41:12,097 --> 00:41:13,523
MATT: All right, 20 to 15.

741
00:41:13,523 --> 00:41:14,721
LAURA: 16.

742
00:41:14,721 --> 00:41:18,272
MATT: 16. Vex. And then Pike, right after you!

743
00:41:18,272 --> 00:41:21,512
SAM: 11.

744
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:30,385
MATT: 11. Tyriok is hidden away. As you guys begin
to approach the camp, he's like, "I'm going to

745
00:41:30,385 --> 00:41:38,375
"stay back here." So he's way out of the field now.
Scanlan bringing up the rear. As he would want

746
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:46,291
to. All right. So that brings us to the top of the
combat round. All the orcs now have stood up,

747
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:51,021
grabbed their weapons, and they see this giant
hamster wheel of a gnome rolling into the camp.

748
00:41:51,021 --> 00:41:56,019
They all look really confused but have their
weapons ready to go. Vax, you're up first.

749
00:41:56,019 --> 00:41:58,507
LIAM: Poo.

750
00:41:58,507 --> 00:42:00,487
MARISHA: The door's already summoned, yeah?

751
00:42:00,487 --> 00:42:06,890
LIAM: What are we doing, are we waiting, are we
going? I-- I'm going to sling a dagger. I'm going

752
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:11,047
to click my Boots of Haste. I did? Then I'm going
to sling a dagger.

753
00:42:11,047 --> 00:42:12,741
MATT: You used them on the basilisk fight.

754
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:15,741
LIAM: Great, thank you. I'm going to sling a
dagger at the orc right in front of those two bears.

755
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:16,675
MATT: Right there?

756
00:42:16,675 --> 00:42:17,681
LIAM: There. Yeah.

757
00:42:17,681 --> 00:42:18,690
MATT: All right, go for it.

758
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:21,746
LIAM: All right. So advantage.

759
00:42:21,746 --> 00:42:24,767
SAM: We're still trying to draw them out, right?

760
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:26,053
LAURA: Yeah.

761
00:42:26,053 --> 00:42:30,562
LIAM: I got a 21.

762
00:42:30,562 --> 00:42:32,006
MATT: 21 hits.

763
00:42:32,006 --> 00:42:40,149
LIAM: Okay. All right. So I'm going to roll for
damage. So this is Assassin. It is not surprise?

764
00:42:40,149 --> 00:42:47,100
MATT: Not surprise. They have been made aware that
there is a threat, as Scanlan rolled in. You do

765
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,211
have advantage because he doesn't see you. So it
would sneak attack.

766
00:42:50,211 --> 00:42:52,258
TRAVIS: In his gerbil ball.

767
00:42:52,258 --> 00:42:56,359
LIAM: Here comes the sneak attack damage, Two,
four, that was the worst sneak attack damage ever.

768
00:42:56,359 --> 00:43:05,593
(counting) 29.

769
00:43:05,593 --> 00:43:11,024
MATT: 29 points of piercing damage. The giant
creature, as the dagger (whoosh) through the air,

770
00:43:11,024 --> 00:43:15,826
doesn't even notice it. It's looking over where
Scanlan is and is grabbing the chains and breaking

771
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,899
them from where the bears are currently bound.

772
00:43:17,899 --> 00:43:19,109
SAM: Oh shit.

773
00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:24,245
MATT: Hasn't broken them yet, he's going in for
the pull as the dagger (impacts) the back of its

774
00:43:24,245 --> 00:43:27,482
neck and it's looking over in the direction where
it came from. What are you doing?

775
00:43:27,482 --> 00:43:29,121
LIAM: I would like to use my bonus action to
hide.

776
00:43:29,121 --> 00:43:32,558
MATT: Okay, go ahead and go for it. Roll for
stealth.

777
00:43:32,558 --> 00:43:34,789
LIAM: 30.

778
00:43:34,789 --> 00:43:41,124
MATT: 30? He glances over in your direction, looks
up, looks in the other direction, reaches up and

779
00:43:41,124 --> 00:43:45,630
goes to pull the dagger out, but it's already
gone.

780
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:47,243
LAURA: That's so sneaky.

781
00:43:47,243 --> 00:43:50,439
MATT: (roars) And angrily yells out into nothing.
Has no idea where you are.

782
00:43:50,439 --> 00:43:54,138
LIAM: And then I'm going to use my movement to
squish down into the snow a bit, up to here,

783
00:43:54,138 --> 00:43:56,471
feathers sticking out a little bit.

784
00:43:56,471 --> 00:43:59,658
MATT: Awesome. Ends Vax's turn. Percy, you're up.

785
00:43:59,658 --> 00:44:06,233
TALIESIN: Amazingly, I've got a bead on that guy
who's trying to let the bears out of their chains.

786
00:44:06,233 --> 00:44:07,887
MATT: You do, actually. Yes.

787
00:44:07,887 --> 00:44:14,348
TALIESIN: I'm going to take Bad News and I'm going
to sit and take a nice calm breath, and I'm going

788
00:44:14,348 --> 00:44:22,943
to squeeze off a shot and knock him on his ass, so
this is a trick shot, leg hit.

789
00:44:22,943 --> 00:44:24,427
MATT: Go for it.

790
00:44:24,427 --> 00:44:32,222
TALIESIN: Wait, before I do anything, I still can
use Hex because the last creature to have Hex on

791
00:44:32,222 --> 00:44:35,730
them died, so I can use it as a bonus action to
cast Hex again, can't I?

792
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,385
MATT: Correct. How long does it last, though?

793
00:44:37,385 --> 00:44:39,787
TALIESIN: Couple hours, I believe.

794
00:44:39,787 --> 00:44:41,447
MATT: I will check.

795
00:44:41,447 --> 00:44:42,784
TALIESIN: Might have been too long.

796
00:44:42,784 --> 00:44:46,775
MATT: It's been about an hour or so since that
last encounter as you were travelling through the

797
00:44:46,775 --> 00:44:50,298
forest, so with Hex, up to an hour. Yeah,
unfortunately.

798
00:44:50,298 --> 00:44:53,804
TALIESIN: Oh, fuck it. And it's a full day's rest?
It's a long rest.

799
00:44:53,804 --> 00:44:58,168
MATT: For you, yeah. 'Cause it's the feat as
opposed to an actual class feature.

800
00:44:58,168 --> 00:45:00,008
All right, taking your aim.

801
00:45:00,008 --> 00:45:01,967
TALIESIN: That's fine! Taking that shot.

802
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:03,525
MATT: Sharpshooter or not?

803
00:45:03,525 --> 00:45:08,617
TALIESIN: No, not Sharpshooter. That's 24 to hit.

804
00:45:08,617 --> 00:45:15,356
MATT: 24 hits! Heavy plate armor covered orc-like
creature. Bigger than a regular orc that you've

805
00:45:15,356 --> 00:45:16,672
seen before.

806
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:19,004
TALIESIN: He has a strength saving throw?

807
00:45:19,004 --> 00:45:20,444
MATT: Yes, he does.

808
00:45:20,444 --> 00:45:22,023
TRAVIS: Which one is he?

809
00:45:22,023 --> 00:45:25,486
MATT: That is going to be a nine, 'cause he rolled
really bad.

810
00:45:25,486 --> 00:45:26,934
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, he's prone.

811
00:45:26,934 --> 00:45:28,646
MATT: So with that (impact).

812
00:45:28,646 --> 00:45:38,659
TALIESIN: He also takes 15 points of piercing
damage.

813
00:45:38,659 --> 00:45:45,545
MATT: 15 points of piercing damage. As you
(gunshot) rockets off, the sound cracks through

814
00:45:45,545 --> 00:45:51,446
the air. All the orcs now glance over in your
direction, as the bullet streaks past them,

815
00:45:51,446 --> 00:45:57,307
tickling the bottom of the feet of the guy who's
strung up, and slamming into the chest of the

816
00:45:57,307 --> 00:46:01,675
armored orc. Lands straight on his back on the
ground right there.

817
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:05,563
TALIESIN: Cool.

818
00:46:05,563 --> 00:46:07,028
MATT: All right.

819
00:46:07,028 --> 00:46:13,023
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to move to my right
six spaces and I'm going to take another shot at

820
00:46:13,023 --> 00:46:17,328
the guy who's right ahead of us, in front of 
the pit.

821
00:46:17,328 --> 00:46:18,882
MATT: Right there?

822
00:46:18,882 --> 00:46:22,710
TALIESIN: Yeah, right there. I'm going to take a
Sharpshooter shot.

823
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:25,410
MATT: Go for it. You reload and then the third
attack for the shot.

824
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:36,833
TALIESIN: Yep. Whoa, that's nice. 18, 19, 20, 21,
22, 23. 27. That hits. That's ridiculous.

825
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:39,464
MATT: Is that even with Sharpshooter?

826
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:41,161
TALIESIN: Yeah. I rolled an 18.

827
00:46:41,161 --> 00:46:43,120
MATT: (chuckle) All righty.

828
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:55,957
TALIESIN: So that's a better roll? A better roll.
That was a pretty good roll. 16, 17, 17, 27-- 33

829
00:46:55,957 --> 00:46:57,420
points of damage.

830
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:05,740
MATT: 33 points of damage. You blow that orc's
head clear off its shoulder. Spray of mist comes

831
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:11,108
out the top of his form, as he slumps down into
the fire in front of him. Two other orcs look over

832
00:47:11,108 --> 00:47:14,465
at you, who are now clearly visible. (grunts)

833
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:16,852
TALIESIN: I put down the gun and I breathe.

834
00:47:16,852 --> 00:47:21,290
MATT: (chuckles) All right, that ends your turn.
Brings us to Keyleth.

835
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:24,634
MARISHA: Okay, you mentioned that a few were
coming over and looking over at the edge of the

836
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:26,996
pit. Are there still a few more at the edge of the
pit?

837
00:47:26,996 --> 00:47:30,592
MATT: They weren't coming and looking at the edge
of the pit, they all looked over in the direction

838
00:47:30,592 --> 00:47:34,088
of where Scanlan was rolling in, around the
center. They're all still in place watching this

839
00:47:34,088 --> 00:47:39,467
giant gnome roll in, but some of them have looked
over at Percy, who's firing a very loud weapon in

840
00:47:39,467 --> 00:47:41,033
their vicinity.

841
00:47:41,033 --> 00:47:42,643
TALIESIN: I figured I would be part of the
distraction.

842
00:47:42,643 --> 00:47:47,183
MARISHA: Sure. How far away is that guy from the
pit?

843
00:47:47,183 --> 00:47:49,229
MATT: He's about 15 feet.

844
00:47:49,229 --> 00:47:55,502
MARISHA: Okay, here's what I want to do. I'm going
to go earth elemental, but I want to, like, do it

845
00:47:55,502 --> 00:47:58,348
like a badass, you know? So I see Scanlan--

846
00:47:58,348 --> 00:48:00,478
MATT: Did you use your scorpion form?

847
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:04,112
MARISHA: Fuck! I did use scorpion. Fuck, damn it,
we haven't taken a short rest.

848
00:48:04,112 --> 00:48:06,791
MATT: You haven't taken a short rest. Yeah, so you
can't--

849
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:09,598
MARISHA: Then I don't do any of that. Instead,
where's Scanlan?

850
00:48:09,598 --> 00:48:11,218
MATT: Scanlan is right here.

851
00:48:11,218 --> 00:48:14,034
TALIESIN: I thought we had taken a short rest, just not
a long rest.

852
00:48:14,034 --> 00:48:14,857
MATT: Between?

853
00:48:14,857 --> 00:48:17,004
TALIESIN: Yeah. 'Cause we stopped and we healed.

854
00:48:17,004 --> 00:48:20,537
MATT: You know what? You may have, yeah! If you
want to do that, I'll let you do it.

855
00:48:20,537 --> 00:48:23,612
MARISHA: Did we? Are you sure?

856
00:48:23,612 --> 00:48:25,117
SAM: We healed up each other.

857
00:48:25,117 --> 00:48:26,416
MARISHA: All right, fine!

858
00:48:26,416 --> 00:48:29,488
MATT: We'll say we allowed a short rest, that way
you were reviving Tyriok and everything. That's fine.

859
00:48:29,488 --> 00:48:38,485
MARISHA: Okay, so I walk and I sink into the
ground as I'm walking off, and I want to pop up

860
00:48:38,485 --> 00:48:39,948
next to this guy.

861
00:48:39,948 --> 00:48:41,531
MATT: All right.

862
00:48:41,531 --> 00:48:45,233
MARISHA: And I want to throw his ass in the pit.

863
00:48:45,233 --> 00:48:47,288
(cheering)

864
00:48:47,288 --> 00:48:52,182
MARISHA: (yelling) This. Is. Vox Machina!
...Town.

865
00:48:52,182 --> 00:48:54,721
MATT: All right, go ahead and make an athletics
check.

866
00:48:54,721 --> 00:48:57,037
MARISHA: ...Territory. Strength check?

867
00:48:57,037 --> 00:49:00,355
MATT: You know what, this would be strength. Yeah,
we'll make it strength.

868
00:49:00,355 --> 00:49:04,864
MARISHA: 17.

869
00:49:04,864 --> 00:49:13,420
MATT: 17? Okay. The orc looks as you (explosion)
out of the snow and rock being thrown out of the

870
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:19,348
area, and, "Huh?" looks over his shoulder at you
with confused look, goes to wring the edge of this

871
00:49:19,348 --> 00:49:25,587
giant club it's holding to come towards you as you
grab both shoulders, gives you this look of utter,

872
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:32,893
sheer fear, as you lift him up and lob him over
the side into the pit.

873
00:49:32,893 --> 00:49:35,503
TALIESIN: That dryad can help kill him now.

874
00:49:35,503 --> 00:49:39,702
MATT: Yeah, he does not make his save.

875
00:49:39,702 --> 00:49:43,917
SAM: Oh no, is he going to crush the dryad?

876
00:49:43,917 --> 00:49:46,682
MARISHA: He's going to get crushed. He's going to
crush the dryad.

877
00:49:46,682 --> 00:49:50,539
MATT: 28 points of damage. Yeah, you hear a
(pained grunt).

878
00:49:50,539 --> 00:49:52,295
SAM: He died?

879
00:49:52,295 --> 00:49:54,514
MATT: You don't know.

880
00:49:54,514 --> 00:49:57,391
LAURA: Do we also hear a little dryad voice?

881
00:49:57,391 --> 00:49:59,190
MATT: (high-pitched grunt)

882
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:00,756
(laughter)

883
00:50:00,756 --> 00:50:02,658
MATT: As it gets sandwiched.

884
00:50:02,658 --> 00:50:03,876
LIAM: Pushed it through.

885
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:13,855
MATT: The dryad was almost out of the pit,
climbing her way out (heavy landing). All right,

886
00:50:13,855 --> 00:50:16,131
so Keyleth, does that end your turn?

887
00:50:16,131 --> 00:50:17,133
MARISHA: Yeah.

888
00:50:17,133 --> 00:50:18,480
MATT: All right, Grog, you're up.

889
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,151
TRAVIS: I'm going to hold my turn until all of our
party has gone.

890
00:50:23,151 --> 00:50:27,873
MATT: So I'll let you go to the back of the
initiative order.

891
00:50:27,873 --> 00:50:29,627
TRAVIS: Okay, yeah, sure.

892
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:35,535
MATT: All righty. Vex? What you got?

893
00:50:35,535 --> 00:50:43,612
LAURA: I'm going to run forward. Well, actually,
I'm going to stay hidden. Okay. I'm going to--

894
00:50:43,612 --> 00:50:45,655
SAM: Those seem like opposite commands.

895
00:50:45,655 --> 00:50:49,129
LAURA: I know, I know, I know. Can I stealth
forward?

896
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:51,419
MATT: I mean, no one seems to have noticed you at
the moment.

897
00:50:51,419 --> 00:50:57,043
LAURA: Okay, good, then I stealth forward, towards
the camp, towards the tent, away, staying away

898
00:50:57,043 --> 00:51:01,913
from people. Yeah. Is that as far as I can go in,
towards the tent?

899
00:51:01,913 --> 00:51:03,913
MATT: Six spaces, yeah, 'cause you don't have any
additional movement from there.

900
00:51:03,913 --> 00:51:06,189
LAURA: Then I'm going to stealthily--

901
00:51:06,189 --> 00:51:08,966
MATT: You can keep moving if you use the rest of
your action to move again.

902
00:51:08,966 --> 00:51:12,267
LAURA: I'll be able to get to it on my next turn?
To the tent?

903
00:51:12,267 --> 00:51:13,340
MATT: Yeah.

904
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:16,967
LAURA: Okay. Then I'll shoot one of the guys.

905
00:51:16,967 --> 00:51:18,802
MATT: All right, which one do you want to shoot?

906
00:51:18,802 --> 00:51:21,183
LAURA: That--

907
00:51:21,183 --> 00:51:24,558
MATT: The one right there?

908
00:51:24,558 --> 00:51:29,721
LAURA: Yeah. That's really hard to hold steady.
Yeah, I'm going to shoot him.

909
00:51:29,721 --> 00:51:33,970
MATT: Okay, go for it. Both attacks?

910
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:37,402
LAURA: Yeah. 18 on the first.

911
00:51:37,402 --> 00:51:39,284
MATT: 18 just barely hits.

912
00:51:39,284 --> 00:51:41,009
LAURA: And 30 on the second?

913
00:51:41,009 --> 00:51:43,002
MATT: That hits. Roll damage twice on that.

914
00:51:43,002 --> 00:51:51,111
LAURA: Okay. 15, 16, 17. And that's sneak attack?

915
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:53,144
MATT: Yes, on the first one. So roll an
additional--

916
00:51:53,144 --> 00:51:56,358
LAURA: Five is 22?

917
00:51:56,358 --> 00:51:59,158
MATT: 22 points of damage for the first arrow.
Nice. Second attack?

918
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:07,438
LAURA: Second attack is five, seven, 13, no 14. 12? I can
add. 13, 14. Oh no, I don't get sneak attack on

919
00:52:07,438 --> 00:52:08,498
the second.

920
00:52:08,498 --> 00:52:09,514
MATT: No, just the first one.

921
00:52:09,514 --> 00:52:10,615
LAURA: 14 on the second attack.

922
00:52:10,615 --> 00:52:16,268
MATT: 14. Nice. You pull two arrows out and
release them both at once. As you duck behind the

923
00:52:16,268 --> 00:52:21,472
tree, the guy who's pulled out this giant greataxe
and is now starting to lumber in the direction of

924
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:27,371
Keyleth, this giant earth elemental that burst out
of the ground. Both arrows sink in.

925
00:52:27,371 --> 00:52:29,143
LAURA: I use my bonus action to hide.

926
00:52:29,143 --> 00:52:33,481
MATT: Go ahead and roll stealth again. As both
arrows sink into the back of the armor, piercing

927
00:52:33,481 --> 00:52:37,945
through, and embedding themselves a few inches or
more into the back of this, this creature looks

928
00:52:37,945 --> 00:52:40,180
over its shoulder towards you. What'd you roll?

929
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:41,372
LAURA: 36.

930
00:52:41,372 --> 00:52:48,564
MATT: 36? Glances back over. Doesn't seem to have
any idea where the arrows came from, but is

931
00:52:48,564 --> 00:52:54,012
grimacing in the pain. End your turn? All right,
Pike, now, is going to--

932
00:52:54,012 --> 00:52:55,623
LAURA: Oh, Pike!

933
00:52:55,623 --> 00:53:10,610
MATT: As everyone's scattered about, Pike is going
to move forward. Let's see here. Yeah, going to do

934
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:13,534
what Pike would do.

935
00:53:13,534 --> 00:53:14,552
TRAVIS: Guiding Bolt.

936
00:53:14,552 --> 00:53:15,598
MATT: Guiding Bolt!

937
00:53:15,598 --> 00:53:16,611
(laughter)

938
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:17,642
TRAVIS: Yes!

939
00:53:17,642 --> 00:53:19,731
LIAM, LAURA, and TRAVIS: Yeah!

940
00:53:19,731 --> 00:53:23,207
LAURA: But she's really strong now, with the
Guiding Bolt. Yeah!

941
00:53:23,207 --> 00:53:26,739
MARISHA: WWPD. What would Pike do?

942
00:53:26,739 --> 00:53:30,680
MATT: So Pike is going aim it at one of the guys,
one of the guys with the javelins that was

943
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:35,829
throwing at the guy, to prevent that from
happening. Guiding Bolt on that. Ranged spell

944
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:41,130
attack-- oh yeah, that'll hit. That's a 15 plus
six. Yeah, that hits.

945
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:42,568
LIAM: Come on, Trickfoot!

946
00:53:42,568 --> 00:53:44,595
MATT: All righty, that's 4d6 radiant damage to
that guy.

947
00:53:44,595 --> 00:53:45,692
LIAM: Dag, yo!

948
00:53:45,692 --> 00:53:47,568
TRAVIS: 4d6?

949
00:53:47,568 --> 00:53:51,386
MATT: 4d6. 15 radiant damage.

950
00:53:51,386 --> 00:53:53,282
ALL: Oh.

951
00:53:53,282 --> 00:53:55,318
TRAVIS: You roll her really well.

952
00:53:55,318 --> 00:53:57,810
MATT: 15 points of radiant damage, the next attack
against that guy has advantage, as he's now a

953
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:02,836
giant beacon, as the blast streaks forward from
her extended hand, smashes into the front of this

954
00:54:02,836 --> 00:54:08,226
orc, drops the javelin in his hand, spins around,
looking in the direction she came from and you can

955
00:54:08,226 --> 00:54:13,502
now see there's this glow pulsing off the front of
his armor. That's going to go ahead and end her

956
00:54:13,502 --> 00:54:31,036
turn, bringing us down to their turn. Now, this
guy is going to try and get back up. He's going to

957
00:54:31,036 --> 00:54:37,678
bring down his greataxe onto the chains he was
setting up, he was going to try and break them.

958
00:54:37,678 --> 00:54:42,156
Now he's going to smash it down. Breaks both of
the chains and both of the bears are now free.

959
00:54:42,156 --> 00:54:43,531
TALIESIN: He's prone, though, can he do that?

960
00:54:43,531 --> 00:54:44,656
SAM: He just got up.

961
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:52,956
MATT: He got up. He can still only move three more
squares, there. That's going to finish his turn.

962
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:58,807
This guy here is going to lurch forward in the
front of you, Keyleth, and take two swings with

963
00:54:58,807 --> 00:55:04,402
his greataxe towards you. That is a 17 to hit?

964
00:55:04,402 --> 00:55:07,608
MARISHA: 17 is my natural armor.

965
00:55:07,608 --> 00:55:15,131
MATT: All right, so that hits. And then that is an
18. 17 and 18 both hit you. You take 24 points of

966
00:55:15,131 --> 00:55:20,802
slashing damage, as each smash of the greataxe
streaks across the front of the stony armor that

967
00:55:20,802 --> 00:55:24,168
you wear, breaking off chunks here and there, but
there's plenty more where that came from as an

968
00:55:24,168 --> 00:55:31,268
earth elemental. That ends his turn. Let's see.
This guy's going to rush up, this guy's going to

969
00:55:31,268 --> 00:55:39,688
rush up, this guy here is going to attempt to
climb out. He gets partway up, starts cresting

970
00:55:39,688 --> 00:55:46,221
over the edge, he's not up because he was knocked
prone as he fell, so he's over the side. Percy,

971
00:55:46,221 --> 00:55:53,381
you see one orcish arm come up and start to pull
itself out the side of the pit. This guy here is

972
00:55:53,381 --> 00:55:56,452
going to move up, grabbing another javelin. This
guy is going to pick up his javelin from the

973
00:55:56,452 --> 00:56:00,959
ground, move over this way, seeing that the earth
elemental is being taken care of, and they're both

974
00:56:00,959 --> 00:56:08,462
going to throw javelins at you. Let's see, that is
a 24 to hit.

975
00:56:08,462 --> 00:56:10,798
TALIESIN: Can I do a Gloves of Missile Snaring?

976
00:56:10,798 --> 00:56:13,736
MATT: Yes, you can. Go ahead and roll.

977
00:56:13,736 --> 00:56:16,596
LAURA: Are those the ones I gave you?

978
00:56:16,596 --> 00:56:21,771
TALIESIN: Yeah, so that's 24 to hit?

979
00:56:21,771 --> 00:56:24,891
MATT: Well, what does it say on the gloves?

980
00:56:24,891 --> 00:56:29,490
TALIESIN: It's actually-- I can reduce damage, I
can't change whether or not it hit.

981
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:35,377
MATT: Yes, exactly, so it is eight points of
piercing damage.

982
00:56:35,377 --> 00:56:44,978
TALIESIN: Eight? Eight points of piercing damage?
Okay, so I'm going to try and catch it. And yeah,

983
00:56:44,978 --> 00:56:50,389
I reduce the damage to zero and I actually can
catch it in midair.

984
00:56:50,389 --> 00:56:55,680
MATT: As it chucks the javelin, you catch it and
stop it in midair.

985
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,626
TALIESIN: Stab it into the ground.

986
00:56:57,626 --> 00:57:04,501
MATT: Stab it into the ground. As you're thinking
how awesome that was, the other one rolled a

987
00:57:04,501 --> 00:57:05,899
natural 20.

988
00:57:05,899 --> 00:57:07,353
(groaning)

989
00:57:07,353 --> 00:57:08,869
LIAM: Oh, look at that smile.

990
00:57:08,869 --> 00:57:13,535
MATT: However! Still rolled pretty low on the
damage. That's going to be nine points of piercing

991
00:57:13,535 --> 00:57:14,696
damage for the second one.

992
00:57:14,696 --> 00:57:16,187
TALIESIN: Can I use it again or no?

993
00:57:16,187 --> 00:57:20,366
MATT: What does it say on the glove? It's a
reaction. You only get one reaction per round, so

994
00:57:20,366 --> 00:57:21,570
no, you cannot.

995
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:23,289
TALIESIN: What did they roll to hit, though?

996
00:57:23,289 --> 00:57:25,190
MATT: That one was a 20, a natural 20.

997
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:26,499
TALIESIN: A natural 20, so it hits no matter
what.

998
00:57:26,499 --> 00:57:29,627
MATT: Yeah. So yeah, you take nine points of
piercing damage as the other javelin streaks past

999
00:57:29,627 --> 00:57:34,821
you, it cuts past the shoulder, nothing too bad,
but didn't quite take away from the moment that

1000
00:57:34,821 --> 00:57:36,163
you just got to enjoy.

1001
00:57:36,163 --> 00:57:37,545
TALIESIN: I took eight points of damage?

1002
00:57:37,545 --> 00:57:42,527
MATT: Nine points of piercing damage. All right,
that ends that orc's turn. This one, the one that

1003
00:57:42,527 --> 00:57:46,128
seems more decorated with the gem-encrusted
headband runs out and starts shouting orders.

1004
00:57:46,128 --> 00:57:50,673
SAM: Did the two that were on me attack?

1005
00:57:50,673 --> 00:57:56,852
MATT: He's going to come forward and begin to
attempt to attack your orb as well. All three

1006
00:57:56,852 --> 00:57:59,280
strike at the orb, trying to cut through.

1007
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,518
SAM: Can I act like they're hurting me?

1008
00:58:02,518 --> 00:58:03,938
MATT: If you want to.

1009
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:06,402
SAM: Ugh! Ah! Ooh! Oh!

1010
00:58:06,402 --> 00:58:08,009
MATT: Make a deception check.

1011
00:58:08,009 --> 00:58:11,335
SAM: Deception?

1012
00:58:11,335 --> 00:58:12,739
MATT: Deception, yes.

1013
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,135
SAM: 27.

1014
00:58:14,135 --> 00:58:19,396
LIAM: Okay, Sam, I'm going to need five small pain
reactions and five large pain reactions.

1015
00:58:19,396 --> 00:58:21,900
SAM: (sounds of pain)

1016
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,218
TALIESIN: Can I get some closed-mouth ones?

1017
00:58:23,218 --> 00:58:24,555
SAM: (sounds of pain)

1018
00:58:24,555 --> 00:58:26,372
TALIESIN: Okay, now breathier.

1019
00:58:26,372 --> 00:58:34,644
MATT: As they're all striking at this sphere,
sparks of arcane energy shooting off with each

1020
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:38,401
blade attack against the outside, they're all
getting winded. You can see sweat dripping off

1021
00:58:38,401 --> 00:58:42,244
their brow, as they're not seemingly making an
impact. However, with each pained cry you give

1022
00:58:42,244 --> 00:58:46,853
out, you see their grins widen. And they realize,
no, this is working. And all three of them keep

1023
00:58:46,853 --> 00:58:53,852
hacking at it, as the one war chief is like,
(yelling in Orcish) and they keep slamming at the

1024
00:58:53,852 --> 00:58:55,523
sides of this in hopes of cutting through it.

1025
00:58:55,523 --> 00:58:58,518
TALIESIN: Cats with a catnip toy.

1026
00:58:58,518 --> 00:59:11,995
MATT: This one, two javelins there, that's good
there, that's good there. I don't think they have

1027
00:59:11,995 --> 00:59:17,376
one, in there-- nope! So that is going to be the
end of their turn. Now the bears are going to go.

1028
00:59:17,376 --> 00:59:25,779
The two bears are going to go tromping forward 40
feet. 35, 40.

1029
00:59:25,779 --> 00:59:27,920
MARISHA: Remember the love in your heart!

1030
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:37,213
MATT: This one's going to go ahead and run past to
there. Since they can't attack anything, this one's

1031
00:59:37,213 --> 00:59:41,851
going to keep moving around. He uses his movement
to get behind there and starts biting at the back

1032
00:59:41,851 --> 00:59:50,352
of the ball. This one will get over to the earth
elemental, as it is the biggest and most visible

1033
00:59:50,352 --> 00:59:55,247
target. All right, that's going to go ahead and
end their turn. Scanlan, you're up.

1034
00:59:55,247 --> 01:00:00,084
SAM: Yeah, it's my turn.

1035
01:00:00,084 --> 01:00:02,254
TRAVIS: Wait, are we at the top of the round?

1036
01:00:02,254 --> 01:00:08,072
SAM: No, no, it's bottom of the round. I'm the
last guy and then you. Oh shit, do I keep them

1037
01:00:08,072 --> 01:00:09,756
here, or do I go to work?

1038
01:00:09,756 --> 01:00:11,045
LAURA: Get them out.

1039
01:00:11,045 --> 01:00:18,605
SAM: Okay, I'm going to very quickly drop the orb
and Dimension Door into one of the tents.

1040
01:00:18,605 --> 01:00:29,652
MATT: Okay. The orb vanishes, and with a flick of
your wrist, a goodbye wave, you vanish entirely

1041
01:00:29,652 --> 01:00:32,535
from sight. Which tent do you want to appear in?

1042
01:00:32,535 --> 01:00:38,686
SAM: I had wanted to go to not the one that Laura
was saying, the other one. That's the one I was

1043
01:00:38,686 --> 01:00:41,681
going to go to, because it's closer to the door.

1044
01:00:41,681 --> 01:00:49,680
MATT: So you appear inside this tent. And on the
inside you can see there are two people that are

1045
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,902
currently within. Just to mark where the tent is.

1046
01:00:52,902 --> 01:00:55,925
SAM: Are they human? Or are they dancer?

1047
01:00:55,925 --> 01:01:04,993
MATT: They are human and they're pretty
brutalized. One of them you see is this relatively

1048
01:01:04,993 --> 01:01:11,555
well-dressed nobleman, his clothing filthy. Part
of his face is swollen and bruised from what looks

1049
01:01:11,555 --> 01:01:17,107
like he's been beaten within an inch of his life.
The other one is a woman and you can see, one arm

1050
01:01:17,107 --> 01:01:21,544
appears to be broken and she's cradling it in her
hand. And they're both recoiling and holding to

1051
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:26,661
the back, like the corners of the tent, and when
you appear, they both gasp and begin naturally

1052
01:01:26,661 --> 01:01:28,772
scrambling away before they realize you're not an
orc.

1053
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:34,619
SAM: I say, come with me if you want to live. And
do I have any movement? Can I try to unbind them?

1054
01:01:34,619 --> 01:01:39,031
MATT: Yeah, you don't have movement. You can start
to move over to start unbinding them if you want to.

1055
01:01:39,031 --> 01:01:40,510
SAM: Okay, that's what I'll do.

1056
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:48,327
MATT: Okay, so you go to the rope bonds and start
helping them try and release themselves. Okay.

1057
01:01:48,327 --> 01:01:51,112
That's the end of Scanlan's turn. Grog, you're
up.

1058
01:01:51,112 --> 01:01:56,173
TRAVIS: Watching everybody run forward, forming
this delicious mosh pit right there in the middle,

1059
01:01:56,173 --> 01:02:05,512
can I go into a frenzied rage? Can I book ass
towards all these bastards and see if I can get

1060
01:02:05,512 --> 01:02:07,583
close to this little prick?

1061
01:02:07,583 --> 01:02:09,679
MATT: 30, 35, 40--

1062
01:02:09,679 --> 01:02:10,982
TRAVIS: I have 50.

1063
01:02:10,982 --> 01:02:12,684
MATT: 45--

1064
01:02:12,684 --> 01:02:15,596
(cheering)

1065
01:02:15,596 --> 01:02:16,715
TRAVIS: I'm good!

1066
01:02:16,715 --> 01:02:22,325
MATT: We'll say, go ahead and make an acrobatics
check to try and move between those two guys.

1067
01:02:22,325 --> 01:02:26,244
TRAVIS: 20.

1068
01:02:26,244 --> 01:02:33,567
MATT: 20. Okay! You manage to, in a rage, as
you're rushing through, yelling. They're all

1069
01:02:33,567 --> 01:02:40,929
confused by the moment of the disappearing hamster
ball of a gnome, look over their shoulder, and you

1070
01:02:40,929 --> 01:02:45,727
dive into a shoulder roll, like a bowling ball,
slamming into two of them, finding your feet on

1071
01:02:45,727 --> 01:02:50,157
the other side, swing around, and the two that you
pushed past, knocked on their shoulder, didn't

1072
01:02:50,157 --> 01:02:54,057
fall off their feet, but you manage to push your
way through, land in place, spin around. You can

1073
01:02:54,057 --> 01:02:55,589
take the rest of your turn, if you want.

1074
01:02:55,589 --> 01:03:03,895
TRAVIS: Can I turn and say, all right, amateurs,
time to go pro! And I would like to use Reckless

1075
01:03:03,895 --> 01:03:12,650
Attack and with my frenzied rage, I take all three
attacks at the crystal-bearing piece of shit. I

1076
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:13,947
can't hit him with my thing.

1077
01:03:13,947 --> 01:03:15,607
MATT: Right there? He's just out of range.

1078
01:03:15,607 --> 01:03:18,561
TRAVIS: He's just out of range? Whoever's the
closest except for the bear.

1079
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:20,697
MATT: Okay. It'll be either one of those two
guys.

1080
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:21,936
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, he'll take it.

1081
01:03:21,936 --> 01:03:23,137
MATT: All right, go for it.

1082
01:03:23,137 --> 01:03:25,652
TRAVIS: He'll take all of it. So I have advantage
on these and advantage on attacks.

1083
01:03:25,652 --> 01:03:29,732
MATT: I'd say, go for each attack, just in case,
individually, just in case you manage to kill one,

1084
01:03:29,732 --> 01:03:31,083
you can move on to the next.

1085
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:32,639
TRAVIS: So do all the attacks first?

1086
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:34,231
MATT: Yeah. Well no, do the first attack.

1087
01:03:34,231 --> 01:03:35,593
LIAM: Attack and damage, attack and damage.

1088
01:03:35,593 --> 01:03:39,577
TRAVIS: Attack and damage, okay. 15 for the first
one.

1089
01:03:39,577 --> 01:03:41,044
MATT: 15 for the first one hits!

1090
01:03:41,044 --> 01:03:50,126
TRAVIS: Yay! Oh god, nine. 18! 18 points of
damage.

1091
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:51,594
MATT: 18 points of damage, all right.

1092
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:53,016
TRAVIS: And there's a constitution--

1093
01:03:53,016 --> 01:03:54,128
MATT: Does fail its save.

1094
01:03:54,128 --> 01:04:02,221
TRAVIS: Yay! Give me your shit. Okay, second one
is a 24.

1095
01:04:02,221 --> 01:04:04,072
MATT: 24 points of damage?

1096
01:04:04,072 --> 01:04:05,318
TRAVIS: No, 24 to hit.

1097
01:04:05,318 --> 01:04:06,507
MATT: 24 to hit? 24 hits.

1098
01:04:06,507 --> 01:04:12,969
TRAVIS: Yep. That's crap, nine. That's also 18
points of damage on the second one.

1099
01:04:12,969 --> 01:04:21,459
MATT: 18. The first hack cleaves into the side of
his shoulders, the second one you bring across his

1100
01:04:21,459 --> 01:04:26,705
midsection and his whole innards spill out onto
the snow. Crumples into the ground before you.

1101
01:04:26,705 --> 01:04:30,849
TRAVIS: And when I kill someone, I get an
additional attack.

1102
01:04:30,849 --> 01:04:34,806
MATT: As a bonus action. But you're already using
your bonus action as a frenzied rage.

1103
01:04:34,806 --> 01:04:35,830
TRAVIS: Right, thank you.

1104
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:38,383
MATT: Yeah, so you can do that outside of a
frenzied rage, if you kill something.

1105
01:04:38,383 --> 01:04:41,187
TRAVIS: So this is the last one and there's a bear
there, right?

1106
01:04:41,187 --> 01:04:43,622
MATT: He also did fail his save on that, so you
got another bonus to strength.

1107
01:04:43,622 --> 01:04:47,987
TRAVIS: Hell, upgrades all around, bitches. Last
one.

1108
01:04:47,987 --> 01:04:50,641
MATT: What's your strength at now?

1109
01:04:50,641 --> 01:04:53,609
TRAVIS: 24. It's a plus three on top of everything
else.

1110
01:04:53,609 --> 01:04:54,822
MATT: Plus three on top of that?

1111
01:04:54,822 --> 01:04:55,764
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1112
01:04:55,764 --> 01:04:57,004
MATT: Nice. All right, what was the attack?

1113
01:04:57,004 --> 01:04:59,524
TRAVIS: No, it's a plus one because we took a short
rest, right?

1114
01:04:59,566 --> 01:05:00,325
SAM: We did.

1115
01:05:00,325 --> 01:05:01,974
MATT: When you take a short rest, yeah.

1116
01:05:01,974 --> 01:05:03,918
TRAVIS: That wipes it. Right? Or a long rest wipes
it.

1117
01:05:03,918 --> 01:05:05,647
MATT: Yeah. I believe for Craven Edge--

1118
01:05:05,647 --> 01:05:08,327
TRAVIS: Craven Edge. Strength loss/gain from this
feature lasts until your next short rest.

1119
01:05:08,327 --> 01:05:09,441
MATT: Short rest, yeah.

1120
01:05:09,441 --> 01:05:10,474
TRAVIS: So it's just plus one.

1121
01:05:10,474 --> 01:05:13,204
MATT: But you can say you don't have to take a
short rest if you don't want to. It's up to you.

1122
01:05:13,204 --> 01:05:18,025
TRAVIS: I didn't want to! I'm not hit. I was fine!
I was literally untouched.

1123
01:05:18,025 --> 01:05:22,439
MATT: Yeah, if you wanted to keep it, you would
have been able to walk around aggressively and

1124
01:05:22,439 --> 01:05:23,871
maintain it. That's fine.

1125
01:05:23,871 --> 01:05:25,352
TRAVIS: Yeah. Aggressively.

1126
01:05:25,352 --> 01:05:26,887
MATT: Okay.

1127
01:05:26,887 --> 01:05:28,219
MARISHA: (laughs) Walk around aggressively.

1128
01:05:28,219 --> 01:05:32,927
TRAVIS: 27 on the third one.

1129
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,363
MATT: 27 hits.

1130
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:35,998
TRAVIS: That's the damage.

1131
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:37,123
MATT: Oh, that's the damage, all right.

1132
01:05:37,123 --> 01:05:41,436
TRAVIS: Can I use it against the bear?

1133
01:05:41,436 --> 01:05:43,321
SAM: Ooh.

1134
01:05:43,321 --> 01:05:46,742
TRAVIS: Or just the person, is he the only other
one in range?

1135
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:53,398
MATT: Well, if you're rolling to hit, right?
Whoever you're attacking, the AC differs. So what

1136
01:05:53,398 --> 01:05:55,218
was your attack roll on that one?

1137
01:05:55,218 --> 01:05:56,730
TRAVIS: It was a 24.

1138
01:05:56,730 --> 01:06:00,571
MATT: Yeah, no, that hits the bear. So go for it.
Damage the bear.

1139
01:06:00,571 --> 01:06:03,945
TRAVIS: That was the damage, was 27.

1140
01:06:03,945 --> 01:06:05,971
MATT: 27 points against the bear, got you.

1141
01:06:05,971 --> 01:06:07,024
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1142
01:06:07,024 --> 01:06:13,746
MATT: All right, so after completely gutting the
first guy, you turn around and slam the axe into

1143
01:06:13,746 --> 01:06:20,504
the hide of the bear. Up close, you can see, the
bear, unlike Trinket, edges of its shoulders and

1144
01:06:20,504 --> 01:06:26,635
parts of its spine, you can see bone protruding
out in points and juts. It's different, a little

1145
01:06:26,635 --> 01:06:29,865
more dangerous than a regular bear you've
encountered at the get-go. However, your blade

1146
01:06:29,865 --> 01:06:37,515
does sink a good four to five inches into its
hide, cleaving a giant wound in its side. It howls

1147
01:06:37,515 --> 01:06:41,666
and seems very pissed off. But so are you.

1148
01:06:41,666 --> 01:06:43,660
TRAVIS: Does he have to make a constitution--

1149
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:45,055
MATT: He did make his save at 15.

1150
01:06:45,055 --> 01:06:46,399
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch.

1151
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,893
MATT: That end your turn?

1152
01:06:47,893 --> 01:06:48,944
TRAVIS: That does.

1153
01:06:48,944 --> 01:06:50,919
MATT: That ends your turn! All right, back up to
the top. Vax, you're up.

1154
01:06:50,919 --> 01:06:53,979
LIAM: All right, I'm still hidden, so I'm going to
move along the side of the tent behind those

1155
01:06:53,979 --> 01:06:59,956
barrels. And I want to throw two daggers at the
magic-using orc.

1156
01:06:59,956 --> 01:07:02,954
MATT: Magic-using orc?

1157
01:07:02,954 --> 01:07:04,862
LIAM: Didn't you say one of them was with a
circlet?

1158
01:07:04,862 --> 01:07:05,852
MATT: Oh. That one?

1159
01:07:05,852 --> 01:07:06,831
LIAM: That one.

1160
01:07:06,831 --> 01:07:07,928
MATT: Oh yeah, right there.

1161
01:07:07,928 --> 01:07:11,090
LIAM: Yeah, and I'm going to use my Sharpshooter
ability to do negative five to the attack roll,

1162
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:12,140
plus ten to damage.

1163
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:13,427
MATT: To the damage? Go for it.

1164
01:07:13,427 --> 01:07:19,890
LIAM: I'm going to use Luck. Same exact roll.
First one--

1165
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:21,410
LAURA: You should roll in your box.

1166
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:24,772
LIAM: Okay. I need Wyrmwood! Critrole. 17 from the
first.

1167
01:07:24,772 --> 01:07:26,152
MATT: 17 hits.

1168
01:07:26,152 --> 01:07:30,628
LIAM: 17 hits. And the second one is 15.

1169
01:07:30,628 --> 01:07:32,134
MATT: 15 misses, unfortunately.

1170
01:07:32,134 --> 01:07:34,865
LIAM: Misses, but the sneak attack damage travels
on the first dagger.

1171
01:07:34,865 --> 01:07:35,967
MATT: Yes it does.

1172
01:07:35,967 --> 01:07:57,311
LIAM: Yes it does. So here it comes. (counting)
33. 33 plus six! 39.

1173
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:01,540
MATT: 39, is that with the plus ten?
Sharpshooter?

1174
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,023
LIAM: Oh. No, it's not!

1175
01:08:03,023 --> 01:08:06,663
MATT: So 49.

1176
01:08:06,663 --> 01:08:08,107
LIAM: 49.

1177
01:08:08,107 --> 01:08:12,840
MATT: 49 points of damage, as you dart up along
the side of the tent, getting behind the barrels.

1178
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:23,062
It sinks right into the back, between the shoulder
blades of the chief orc of this group. You see

1179
01:08:23,062 --> 01:08:28,238
his whole body tenses up from the severe amount of
pain and he tries to reach at from the back and

1180
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:30,201
spins around, looking straight at you.

1181
01:08:30,201 --> 01:08:34,170
LIAM: Hey, go fuck yourself. I stare him down.

1182
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:36,886
MATT: All right, okay. Ending your turn there.
Percy, you're up.

1183
01:08:36,886 --> 01:08:41,316
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to grab the javelin
really quick. I'm going to walk over to the guy

1184
01:08:41,316 --> 01:08:43,270
who's just starting to crawl out of the pit.

1185
01:08:43,270 --> 01:08:44,841
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1186
01:08:44,841 --> 01:08:47,697
(laughter)

1187
01:08:47,697 --> 01:08:56,544
TALIESIN: I'm going to look him in the eye.
Javelin goes right in the face.

1188
01:08:56,544 --> 01:08:58,614
MATT: Roll for an attack.

1189
01:08:58,614 --> 01:09:03,031
TALIESIN: I'm using it as a stabbing weapon. I'm
not letting go until he drops.

1190
01:09:03,031 --> 01:09:09,545
MATT: Right, no. I understand. I do not believe
the javelin is finesse. So this may be a

1191
01:09:09,545 --> 01:09:12,204
strength-based attack. Let me double-check.

1192
01:09:12,204 --> 01:09:13,946
LIAM: But it's already happened.

1193
01:09:13,946 --> 01:09:16,491
TALIESIN: That's fine. It wasn't about the
strength!

1194
01:09:16,491 --> 01:09:18,734
MATT: So it's your strength bonus plus five.

1195
01:09:18,734 --> 01:09:20,320
TALIESIN: Strength bonus plus five?

1196
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,155
TRAVIS: With advantage because he's hanging over
a--?

1197
01:09:22,155 --> 01:09:23,799
MATT: What's your strength modifier?

1198
01:09:23,799 --> 01:09:24,880
TALIESIN: One.

1199
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,076
MATT: So plus six for this roll.

1200
01:09:26,076 --> 01:09:27,177
TALIESIN: Plus six?

1201
01:09:27,177 --> 01:09:33,581
MATT: Technically, you get advantage because he's
there, technically prone as he's getting up out of the--

1202
01:09:33,581 --> 01:09:37,253
TALIESIN: Six, seven, eight, nine, 11.

1203
01:09:37,253 --> 01:09:42,644
MATT: 11. Your first attack you whiff. He ducks
out of the way, actually pulling down into the pit

1204
01:09:42,644 --> 01:09:48,179
and it misses his head, and he gets up again and
extends a hand to reach out towards your ankle.

1205
01:09:48,179 --> 01:09:50,298
TALIESIN: Throw it away, pull out the gun and
shoot.

1206
01:09:50,298 --> 01:09:53,029
(laughter)

1207
01:09:53,029 --> 01:09:54,411
LIAM: What a Raiders moment!

1208
01:09:54,411 --> 01:09:56,719
TRAVIS: Yes! Totally.

1209
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:58,777
MARISHA: Yes, totally Indy-ed it!

1210
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:08,509
TALIESIN: First shot to the face. That's still
better. 17 to hit?

1211
01:10:08,509 --> 01:10:09,862
MATT: That hits.

1212
01:10:09,862 --> 01:10:15,818
TALIESIN: Okay. That's 15 points of piercing
damage.

1213
01:10:15,818 --> 01:10:21,988
MATT: As soon as he reaches out for your ankle,
you pull a pistol out and he looks up at you. The

1214
01:10:21,988 --> 01:10:25,844
front of his head detonates and he slumps
backward, falling into the pit silently.

1215
01:10:25,844 --> 01:10:28,751
MARISHA: Silently. Oh no.

1216
01:10:28,751 --> 01:10:32,323
TALIESIN: I'm going to look up to see if anybody
has noticed that this has happened.

1217
01:10:32,323 --> 01:10:37,703
MATT: The two guys that were throwing javelins at
you have watched this happen. They seem

1218
01:10:37,703 --> 01:10:43,002
unaffected, they're just really pissed off at you. Orcs
aren't-- they're used to seeing their friends die,

1219
01:10:43,002 --> 01:10:45,604
they keep coming at you, so these two are like,
(growls).

1220
01:10:45,604 --> 01:10:48,539
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to pick one of them
and take another shot. The one on the left, I'm

1221
01:10:48,539 --> 01:10:51,821
going to take a-- yeah, let's do a sharpshooter
shot on him.

1222
01:10:51,821 --> 01:10:53,142
MATT: Your left, okay.

1223
01:10:53,142 --> 01:10:54,181
TALIESIN: Yeah, our left.

1224
01:10:54,181 --> 01:10:55,360
MATT: Okay, go for it.

1225
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,706
SAM: Stage right.

1226
01:10:56,706 --> 01:11:01,602
TALIESIN: Yeah, that'll hit. 26.

1227
01:11:01,602 --> 01:11:03,399
MATT: 26 hits.

1228
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:08,883
TALIESIN: That's 17 points of damage.

1229
01:11:08,883 --> 01:11:14,072
MATT: 17 points of damage, got it. This one is a
gut shot, hits him on the side of the stomach and

1230
01:11:14,072 --> 01:11:19,349
you can see part of the back of the armor blow
out, and he grabs it for a second and keeps

1231
01:11:19,349 --> 01:11:25,407
looking towards you, seemingly un-fully phased by
the impact of the blow. Going to stay where you are?

1232
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:26,426
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1233
01:11:26,426 --> 01:11:32,816
MATT: Okay. Use that pit to your advantage. Good.
Ending Percy's turn, Keyleth, you're up. Vex,

1234
01:11:32,816 --> 01:11:34,097
you're on deck.

1235
01:11:34,097 --> 01:11:36,236
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to take the two dudes who
are in front of me, you can tell me if I can do

1236
01:11:36,236 --> 01:11:41,208
this twice or not, I want to do my multi-slam
attack, my multi-attack slam, and I want to go, in

1237
01:11:41,208 --> 01:11:50,087
as dictated in Common as I can as an earth
elemental, knock. Knock. And I want to take their

1238
01:11:50,087 --> 01:11:51,807
heads and go, boof-boof.

1239
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:57,848
MATT: (laughs) Okay, so you'll move one, two to
get into combat range with two of them. Go ahead

1240
01:11:57,848 --> 01:11:59,350
and make a slam attack against each of them.

1241
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:00,510
MARISHA: Against each of them?

1242
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:01,621
MATT: Yes.

1243
01:12:01,621 --> 01:12:06,360
MARISHA: Okay. Natural 19 on the first one.

1244
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:07,542
MATT: All right.

1245
01:12:07,542 --> 01:12:09,779
MARISHA: And a natural 18 on the second.

1246
01:12:09,779 --> 01:12:12,497
MATT: I'm going to say those both hit. Go ahead
and roll slam damage.

1247
01:12:12,497 --> 01:12:14,970
LIAM: (rock voice) Knock-knock.

1248
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:28,150
MARISHA: (rock voice) Knock-knock. (normal voice)
First attack is 13 plus-- 18 points. Second, not

1249
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:29,920
as good, ten points.

1250
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:35,515
MATT: Ten points. So you take the larger orc who's
coming at you with full plate armor and this

1251
01:12:35,515 --> 01:12:39,715
greataxe that it's bearing towards you, hacked at
you twice last round, and the one that just got

1252
01:12:39,715 --> 01:12:45,471
shot in its gut by Percy. You stumble in the front
of them and they both look up at you for a second,

1253
01:12:45,471 --> 01:12:51,596
snarl before you go, "Knock-knock." (whack) Crack
their heads together. The one that Percy shot

1254
01:12:51,596 --> 01:12:56,198
pulls back, its nose is smashed and it's a smear
of blood on the front of its face, it's still

1255
01:12:56,198 --> 01:13:00,381
standing but it stumbles back a bit. The other
orc, however, as you pull back in your hand you

1256
01:13:00,381 --> 01:13:04,820
look down, most of its face is completely caved
in, you hear a slight gurgle and a little blub of

1257
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:08,664
blood come out of what used to be its mouth before
its body goes limp in your grasp.

1258
01:13:08,664 --> 01:13:12,237
MARISHA: Can I take his body and chuck it in the
hole?

1259
01:13:12,237 --> 01:13:18,176
MATT: Sure, you take it and throw it over your
head. It arcs right in front of you, Percy, down

1260
01:13:18,176 --> 01:13:25,782
into the pit. You hear a (yelp) as the final
remnants of the dryad are crushed by the fall.

1261
01:13:25,782 --> 01:13:27,158
LAURA: Oh no!

1262
01:13:27,158 --> 01:13:28,741
MARISHA: It served its purpose.

1263
01:13:28,741 --> 01:13:36,444
MATT: All righty. That finishes your turn,
Keyleth.

1264
01:13:36,444 --> 01:13:37,503
MARISHA: Yeah.

1265
01:13:37,503 --> 01:13:38,560
MATT: Vex, you're up.

1266
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,301
LAURA: Oh, me? I thought Travis was after--

1267
01:13:40,301 --> 01:13:41,470
TRAVIS: I'm at the bottom of the round.

1268
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:42,330
LAURA: Oh, every time?

1269
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:43,502
MATT: Yeah, he changed his initiative.

1270
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:48,946
LAURA: Oh, okay. I want to shoot Trinket out into
a Cannonball from--

1271
01:13:48,946 --> 01:13:51,102
MATT: Okay, this'll be your action to do this.

1272
01:13:51,102 --> 01:13:56,503
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to move up to where I'm
lined up with all of that row, so this whole

1273
01:13:56,503 --> 01:13:58,561
shebang right here.

1274
01:13:58,561 --> 01:13:59,465
MATT: Over here?

1275
01:13:59,465 --> 01:14:00,656
LAURA: Yeah. All of these guys.

1276
01:14:00,656 --> 01:14:02,024
TRAVIS: Yeah, please me too.

1277
01:14:02,024 --> 01:14:03,665
LAURA: And you too, because you practiced it with
him.

1278
01:14:03,665 --> 01:14:05,901
TRAVIS: Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1279
01:14:05,901 --> 01:14:12,365
LAURA: Take out the thing and say, Trinket!
Cannonball! And shoot him out and try to roll into

1280
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:13,599
all those guys there.

1281
01:14:13,599 --> 01:14:16,639
MATT: Okay, so using your action and Trinket's
bonus action as part of the attack here.

1282
01:14:16,639 --> 01:14:17,753
LAURA: Right.

1283
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:24,506
MATT: Trinket all of a sudden leaps out of the
necklace, slamming into the larger bear in front.

1284
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:33,176
For 30 feet, that's five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.
What's Trinket's movement?

1285
01:14:33,176 --> 01:14:38,257
LAURA: His move is 40.

1286
01:14:38,257 --> 01:14:45,072
MATT: 40. You have 40, landing right there. Go
ahead and roll three attacks.

1287
01:14:45,072 --> 01:14:46,447
LAURA: Three attacks.

1288
01:14:46,447 --> 01:14:47,991
TRAVIS: Good boy.

1289
01:14:47,991 --> 01:14:53,603
LAURA: Oh god, really? He gets advantage because
he's awesome.

1290
01:14:53,603 --> 01:14:55,522
MATT and LAURA: No.

1291
01:14:55,522 --> 01:14:59,525
LAURA: He rolled pretty fricking bad. 12?

1292
01:14:59,525 --> 01:15:04,865
MATT: 12 hits the bear. It's a big bear. What's
the second attack?

1293
01:15:04,865 --> 01:15:06,071
LAURA: 15?

1294
01:15:06,071 --> 01:15:08,964
MATT: 15 just hits the orc. And the third one?

1295
01:15:08,964 --> 01:15:10,299
LAURA: One!

1296
01:15:10,299 --> 01:15:11,875
MATT and LAURA: Miss.

1297
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:15,293
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll the
Cannonball damage on those two.

1298
01:15:15,293 --> 01:15:16,506
LAURA: What is that?

1299
01:15:16,506 --> 01:15:19,213
MATT: It should be on Trinket's sheet as one of
the attacks.

1300
01:15:19,213 --> 01:15:23,997
LAURA: Cannonball, exclamation point. Cannonball.

1301
01:15:23,997 --> 01:15:25,848
MATT: If you don't have it written down, I have it
in my--

1302
01:15:25,848 --> 01:15:27,225
LIAM: Yeah, go for that.

1303
01:15:27,225 --> 01:15:28,094
LAURA: Yeah.

1304
01:15:28,094 --> 01:15:29,635
MATT: Okay. (laughs)

1305
01:15:29,635 --> 01:15:32,885
LAURA: You know what, you sent it to me forever
ago, it's in my email somewhere, Matt.

1306
01:15:32,885 --> 01:15:37,195
MATT: That's okay. I have it here in my pdf, it's
fine. As part of your beastmaster--

1307
01:15:37,195 --> 01:15:41,595
LAURA: Can you tell me what magical beasts I can
conjure while you're at it, because--

1308
01:15:41,595 --> 01:15:47,376
MATT: I will fight you. All right, 2d6 plus eight
bludgeoning damage.

1309
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,232
LAURA: 2d6 plus eight, okay.

1310
01:15:49,232 --> 01:15:52,502
MATT: However, the one that missed does get an
opportunity attack against Trinket.

1311
01:15:52,502 --> 01:15:53,823
SAM: Oh, snap.

1312
01:15:53,823 --> 01:15:55,860
LAURA: I suck. 2d6 plus eight.

1313
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:57,481
LIAM: Hey, that's not bad.

1314
01:15:57,481 --> 01:15:58,753
LAURA: 12 on the first.

1315
01:15:58,753 --> 01:16:05,505
MATT: Okay, 12 on the first. As the bear slams
into the larger bear, like rolling over the top,

1316
01:16:05,505 --> 01:16:10,974
and then comes down onto the second, the other
target, the orc, smashing into him. The orc almost

1317
01:16:10,974 --> 01:16:15,783
gets knocked off his feet and then the third one
sidesteps and swings at Trinket, so go ahead and

1318
01:16:15,783 --> 01:16:17,710
roll damage for the second orc.

1319
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:18,973
TRAVIS: Nice.

1320
01:16:18,973 --> 01:16:21,344
LAURA: That's better. 17 on the second.

1321
01:16:21,344 --> 01:16:25,651
MATT: 17. Trinket crushes the other orc who'd
already been softened up from the blow from

1322
01:16:25,651 --> 01:16:26,944
Keyleth's earth elemental.

1323
01:16:26,944 --> 01:16:28,245
LAURA: Yes, good job Trinket!

1324
01:16:28,245 --> 01:16:30,632
MATT: As Trinket rolls past, you can see this
crushed form of the orc on the ground in the snow,

1325
01:16:30,632 --> 01:16:33,502
crushed in place.

1326
01:16:33,502 --> 01:16:34,762
LAURA: Good job, buddy!

1327
01:16:34,762 --> 01:16:38,169
MATT: Most of the bones broken and turned to dust.
The third one, however, sidesteps and is going to

1328
01:16:38,169 --> 01:16:42,133
go ahead and take a swing at Trinket. That is
going to be a 19 to hit.

1329
01:16:42,133 --> 01:16:43,233
LAURA: 20!

1330
01:16:43,233 --> 01:16:46,696
MATT: 20. Right across the top of Trinket's armor,
no effect.

1331
01:16:46,696 --> 01:16:48,230
TALIESIN: Can't even hit a bear.

1332
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:49,762
LAURA: Really dizzy though.

1333
01:16:49,762 --> 01:16:51,981
MATT: That's going to be your turn, though.

1334
01:16:51,981 --> 01:16:52,909
LAURA: Okay.

1335
01:16:52,909 --> 01:16:55,393
MATT: All right. That brings us to Pike. Pike--

1336
01:16:55,393 --> 01:16:58,181
LAURA: Can I use my bonus, though? Do I have a
bonus action on top of that?

1337
01:16:58,181 --> 01:17:00,006
MATT: Sure.

1338
01:17:00,006 --> 01:17:01,321
LAURA: Hide?

1339
01:17:01,321 --> 01:17:06,762
MATT: You did not start your round hidden,
unfortunately. Or did you? Oh no, you did, you

1340
01:17:06,762 --> 01:17:12,088
did! You totally did, yes, so you can hide. Roll
stealth. You'll have to move back over here--

1341
01:17:12,088 --> 01:17:13,421
LAURA: Natural 20!

1342
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:14,595
MARISHA: Hey!

1343
01:17:14,595 --> 01:17:17,969
MATT: So you move back behind the tree so you can
find a place to hide. And then you go ahead and

1344
01:17:17,969 --> 01:17:22,523
vanish. Cartoon-style, like run behind the tree
and don't come out the other side.

1345
01:17:22,523 --> 01:17:25,443
LIAM: Does she paddle the canoe down?

1346
01:17:25,443 --> 01:17:35,247
MATT: Pike's going to go ahead and, one, two,
three, four, five. With the view there is going

1347
01:17:35,247 --> 01:17:36,337
to go ahead--

1348
01:17:36,337 --> 01:17:42,673
LIAM: Come on, golden child. I want the Pike.

1349
01:17:42,673 --> 01:17:48,785
MATT: Pike's going to go ahead and continue to run
over here, because she sees that the guy who's

1350
01:17:48,785 --> 01:17:52,603
hanging up there who has three javelins stuck in
him now is like passed out and bleeding.

1351
01:17:52,603 --> 01:17:53,650
LAURA: Oh no.

1352
01:17:53,650 --> 01:17:55,413
MATT: She's making her way around to try and heal
him.

1353
01:17:55,413 --> 01:17:57,183
LIAM: Such an Ashley thing to do.

1354
01:17:57,183 --> 01:18:00,707
MATT: All right. Their turn now.

1355
01:18:00,707 --> 01:18:03,616
SAM: Oh boy.

1356
01:18:03,616 --> 01:18:10,300
MATT: This guy here is going to go ahead and
converge, well no, locked in with Trinket, he's

1357
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:17,565
not going to take the attack of opportunity from
him. This guy's going to move here, that orc's

1358
01:18:17,565 --> 01:18:19,164
going to move around to--

1359
01:18:19,164 --> 01:18:21,647
LAURA: Look at how teeny Trinket is compared to
the other bears!

1360
01:18:21,647 --> 01:18:31,502
MATT: I know. This bear's going to go ahead and
move in on you, Marisha. Big old dire-bear-looking

1361
01:18:31,502 --> 01:18:33,072
creature bearing down on you.

1362
01:18:33,072 --> 01:18:34,342
MARISHA: I brace.

1363
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:41,258
MATT: All right, so. The war chief begins to
scream out, (yelling in Orcish), pointing at you,

1364
01:18:41,258 --> 01:18:49,817
Grog. And you see the other orc on the other side
goes, (yells) and seems to be energized by the

1365
01:18:49,817 --> 01:18:57,640
rousing cry that it's given, so advantage on
attack rolls for all within earshot.

1366
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:00,074
TRAVIS: Come on, give us a tickle.

1367
01:19:00,074 --> 01:19:01,525
LAURA: You can do that?

1368
01:19:01,525 --> 01:19:02,939
MATT: This guy's actually going to move--

1369
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:05,104
SAM: Well, maybe it's another spell or something,
yeah.

1370
01:19:05,104 --> 01:19:06,617
MARISHA: Paladin or some shit like that.

1371
01:19:06,617 --> 01:19:08,189
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's a very paladin thing.

1372
01:19:08,189 --> 01:19:10,082
LAURA: Man, that's a good thing to have.

1373
01:19:10,082 --> 01:19:14,311
MATT: All right. So since I moved him up last
round because he was hiding behind a tree there,

1374
01:19:14,311 --> 01:19:20,836
so the other larger orc, the one that was tending
the bears rushes up alongside with you as well,

1375
01:19:20,836 --> 01:19:26,552
Keyleth. All right, so the war chief is going to
make one attack as a bonus action, it can do that

1376
01:19:26,552 --> 01:19:32,835
against you, Grog, with advantage. That's going to
be a 22 to hit.

1377
01:19:32,835 --> 01:19:34,136
TRAVIS: That'll hit.

1378
01:19:34,136 --> 01:19:37,827
MATT: All right. You take 16 points of slashing
damage, reduced to eight, because you're raging,

1379
01:19:37,827 --> 01:19:43,421
so eight points of slashing damage as the war
chief comes down with its greataxe. It sinks a few

1380
01:19:43,421 --> 01:19:46,971
inches into your shoulder and it carves it down,
almost matching the scar you have across your

1381
01:19:46,971 --> 01:19:53,768
chest, and grinning at you the whole time. As you
grin back at it, his friend is going to come up

1382
01:19:53,768 --> 01:20:00,664
with its greataxe and is going to come down, this
is with advantage as well. That's going to be a 17

1383
01:20:00,664 --> 01:20:01,774
to hit?

1384
01:20:01,774 --> 01:20:02,690
TRAVIS: Misses.

1385
01:20:02,690 --> 01:20:07,135
MATT: That misses. As it comes up overhead to try
and swing down to go towards the top of the nape

1386
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:11,791
of your neck and head area, you notice out of the
corner of your eye, bring up your sword and

1387
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:16,695
deflect it down into the snow behind you, looking
over your shoulder at it. The bear is now going to

1388
01:20:16,695 --> 01:20:20,420
come up alongside and is going to make a bite and
a claw attack against you.

1389
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:21,487
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1390
01:20:21,487 --> 01:20:23,206
MATT: That is going to be a 19 to hit?

1391
01:20:23,206 --> 01:20:24,918
TRAVIS: That's 19, my armor class.

1392
01:20:24,918 --> 01:20:26,446
MATT: And that's going to be a 21 to hit.

1393
01:20:26,446 --> 01:20:27,549
TRAVIS: Yep, both hit.

1394
01:20:27,549 --> 01:20:36,206
MATT: So you take nine points of piercing damage
as it bites you, reduced to four. We'll say four,

1395
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:40,044
I'm trying to round down consistently going
forward. So you take four points of piercing

1396
01:20:40,044 --> 01:20:43,790
damage from that, and then you take 12, reduced to
six slashing damage.

1397
01:20:43,790 --> 01:20:45,862
TRAVIS: Okay. Ten total?

1398
01:20:45,862 --> 01:20:54,722
MATT: Total of 11 points of damage. Or ten, you're
right. From the bear. Bear attacking you, actually

1399
01:20:54,722 --> 01:20:56,621
no, first the orc attacking Trinket now.

1400
01:20:56,621 --> 01:20:57,540
LAURA: No!

1401
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:58,577
MATT: With advantage.

1402
01:20:58,577 --> 01:20:59,896
LAURA: No!

1403
01:20:59,896 --> 01:21:01,944
MATT: Oh man, that's a 16 even with advantage.

1404
01:21:01,944 --> 01:21:02,983
LAURA: Ha!

1405
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:05,686
MATT: Just slamming a greataxe over Trinket's
armor, Trinket--

1406
01:21:05,686 --> 01:21:07,483
LAURA: Trinket's yawning.

1407
01:21:07,483 --> 01:21:16,498
MATT: Bear against you, Keyleth, that's going to
be a natural 20 with the bite.

1408
01:21:16,498 --> 01:21:18,170
MARISHA: Ouch.

1409
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:24,601
MATT: And natural 20 with the claws. Two
natural 20s in a row, that bear wanted a piece of you.

1410
01:21:24,601 --> 01:21:30,179
MARISHA: Keyleth was like, aw, cute. (screams)

1411
01:21:30,179 --> 01:21:44,236
MATT: 18, 24. We're looking at 30, no, 42 points
of damage on you in your elemental form from the bear.

1412
01:21:44,236 --> 01:21:45,763
MARISHA: Damn.

1413
01:21:45,763 --> 01:21:50,932
MATT: Bear bites into you and takes a mouthful of
stone and tears a chunk out of the front of your

1414
01:21:50,932 --> 01:21:56,756
sternum area and then with its claw swipes across
your face, ripping part of your elemental jaw,

1415
01:21:56,756 --> 01:22:00,611
exposing a little bit of soft earth beneath.

1416
01:22:00,611 --> 01:22:02,671
LAURA: Soft earth.

1417
01:22:02,671 --> 01:22:04,295
LIAM: That was your good jaw.

1418
01:22:04,295 --> 01:22:08,685
MATT: The other large orc, the larger one with its
axe is going to take two attacks with its greataxe

1419
01:22:08,685 --> 01:22:12,926
against you. That is a 21 to hit and an 18 to
hit.

1420
01:22:12,926 --> 01:22:15,111
MARISHA: Wait, I'm getting attacked by someone
else, too?

1421
01:22:15,111 --> 01:22:16,717
MATT: Yeah, the other large orc there.

1422
01:22:16,717 --> 01:22:18,219
MARISHA: Yeah, both of those hit.

1423
01:22:18,219 --> 01:22:23,946
MATT: All right. You take 24 points of slashing
damage as both of the greataxe blows come on from

1424
01:22:23,946 --> 01:22:25,332
the other side, you're being--

1425
01:22:25,332 --> 01:22:26,439
MARISHA: 24?

1426
01:22:26,439 --> 01:22:33,187
MATT: --chiseled down now. Yes. That's going to
end their turn. That brings us to Scanlan.

1427
01:22:33,187 --> 01:22:37,171
SAM: Have I freed them from their shackles?

1428
01:22:37,171 --> 01:22:41,214
MATT: We'll say as your action this turn, you will
have been able to get them both out of their

1429
01:22:41,214 --> 01:22:43,823
rope-binds, including the one that has the broken
arm.

1430
01:22:43,823 --> 01:22:50,844
SAM: Okay. The construction of the tent, can I
lift up the back and shuttle them out that way, or

1431
01:22:50,844 --> 01:22:52,882
do I have to cut through it or anything?

1432
01:22:52,882 --> 01:23:00,681
MATT: It's not-- the back flap is currently hit
into the ground with a stake. It shouldn't be too

1433
01:23:00,681 --> 01:23:02,838
hard to lift it up if you want to try.

1434
01:23:02,838 --> 01:23:08,015
SAM: I don't want to waste too much time in there.
You know what, I'll walk them out the front door,

1435
01:23:08,015 --> 01:23:20,894
point them towards the mansion. And say: run, do
not walk, to my beautiful, beautiful house.

1436
01:23:20,894 --> 01:23:22,439
MATT: Which way do you want to go?

1437
01:23:22,439 --> 01:23:24,628
SAM: To the right, stage right when I get out?

1438
01:23:24,628 --> 01:23:28,457
MATT: So right there? Okay.

1439
01:23:28,457 --> 01:23:32,160
SAM: Just enough to get them around the tent,
yeah, and on their way.

1440
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:38,179
MATT: They come out, seeing all the action
happening, looking really nervous. Give you a nod,

1441
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:42,444
and the woman says, "Thank you." And they both
turn, and if you point out the shimmering light,

1442
01:23:42,444 --> 01:23:45,924
they (running) and bolt off spending the entirety
of their round--

1443
01:23:45,924 --> 01:23:48,921
SAM: And I yell to them, wipe your feet before you
go in!

1444
01:23:48,921 --> 01:23:51,172
(laughter)

1445
01:23:51,172 --> 01:23:54,502
MATT: Okay, they won't quite reach the door, but
they're on their way out.

1446
01:23:54,502 --> 01:23:57,031
SAM: That's pretty much all I can move, you
think?

1447
01:23:57,031 --> 01:24:00,182
MATT: From there, yeah. Tiny gnome feet.

1448
01:24:00,182 --> 01:24:02,112
SAM: Okay. Do I have a bonus action?

1449
01:24:02,112 --> 01:24:03,166
MATT: You do.

1450
01:24:03,166 --> 01:24:09,334
SAM: All right. I will-- I can only really see
Keyleth around, right? Everyone else is hiding?

1451
01:24:09,334 --> 01:24:14,949
MATT: You don't see-- well, you see Pike, because
you're running behind. Pike is not making any

1452
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:20,293
tink-tink-tink. Behind you, you can see Grog in a
frenzy.

1453
01:24:20,293 --> 01:24:21,291
TALIESIN: I'm hidden by Keyleth.

1454
01:24:21,291 --> 01:24:22,797
MATT: Yeah, you can't see Percy.

1455
01:24:22,797 --> 01:24:33,320
SAM: I will inspire Keyleth as my bonus action, I
will sing to her, (singing) her blood runs cold, her memory

1456
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:41,454
has just been sold, my druid is a centerfold,
druid is a centerfold. I don't know.

1457
01:24:41,454 --> 01:24:44,012
(laughter)

1458
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:49,454
MATT: If you've ever seen an earth elemental go,
huh? But you take your d10 inspiration die because

1459
01:24:49,454 --> 01:24:53,389
it was a catchy tune, seems familiar. All right.
That's going to end your turn, Scanlan?

1460
01:24:53,389 --> 01:24:54,526
SAM: That's it.

1461
01:24:54,526 --> 01:24:55,635
MATT: Grog, you're up.

1462
01:24:55,635 --> 01:25:01,706
TRAVIS: All this love for me, I'm flattered. And I
would like to use all three of my frenzied rage

1463
01:25:01,706 --> 01:25:03,521
attacks against the bear.

1464
01:25:03,521 --> 01:25:05,001
MATT: Go for it. First attack?

1465
01:25:05,001 --> 01:25:10,292
TRAVIS: First one, reckless, all three reckless,
the first two normal, maybe the third Great Weapon

1466
01:25:10,292 --> 01:25:15,900
Master, we'll see. 21.

1467
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:18,097
MATT: 21 hits. Roll damage.

1468
01:25:18,097 --> 01:25:24,530
TRAVIS: Yes. Awesome. Six, 11, 20, that's 20.

1469
01:25:24,530 --> 01:25:29,871
MATT: 20. With that, you take the axe and you
swing it in a wide arc across the front of the

1470
01:25:29,871 --> 01:25:36,012
bear's body. As you hit the edge of the bone, it
splinters at the impact, and its shoulder-joint is

1471
01:25:36,012 --> 01:25:42,266
knocked out. The sword continues and cuts right
halfway into its throat and actually manages to

1472
01:25:42,266 --> 01:25:47,930
cut through a very main artery and the bear begins
to bleed out on the spot, onto the ground.

1473
01:25:47,930 --> 01:25:52,342
TRAVIS: Is that an automatic failed constitution
save?

1474
01:25:52,342 --> 01:25:58,526
MATT: With the constitution of the bear, no, it
makes it. 14.

1475
01:25:58,526 --> 01:26:00,943
TRAVIS: But he's dead, right?

1476
01:26:00,943 --> 01:26:04,202
MATT: It is dead, the bear is no longer of the
realm of the living.

1477
01:26:04,202 --> 01:26:07,086
TRAVIS: So I killed somebody, so I get an extra
attack, correct?

1478
01:26:07,086 --> 01:26:08,780
MATT: You still get, it's your bonus action--

1479
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:09,794
TRAVIS: Oh, it's the bonus.

1480
01:26:09,794 --> 01:26:11,688
MATT: Right. So unless-- it's only helpful when
you're not frenzying.

1481
01:26:11,688 --> 01:26:12,345
TRAVIS: Beautiful.

1482
01:26:12,345 --> 01:26:13,784
MATT: When you're frenzying you get it every
turn.

1483
01:26:13,784 --> 01:26:15,189
TRAVIS: Yeah, I get it all the time!

1484
01:26:15,189 --> 01:26:16,065
MATT: Yeah.

1485
01:26:16,065 --> 01:26:17,298
TRAVIS: So can I turn to my right--

1486
01:26:17,298 --> 01:26:18,280
MATT: Yeah.

1487
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:19,668
TRAVIS: To the next bloke.

1488
01:26:19,668 --> 01:26:21,314
MATT: Regular one or the war chief?

1489
01:26:21,314 --> 01:26:23,224
TRAVIS: The war chief, let's try the war chief.

1490
01:26:23,224 --> 01:26:25,638
MATT: Sure, all right. Regular attack or Great
Weapon Master?

1491
01:26:25,638 --> 01:26:27,797
TRAVIS: Regular, because I've just got two left so
we'll see how regular does.

1492
01:26:27,797 --> 01:26:29,379
MATT: Go for it.

1493
01:26:29,379 --> 01:26:32,570
TRAVIS: 22.

1494
01:26:32,570 --> 01:26:34,688
MATT: 22 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1495
01:26:34,688 --> 01:26:38,154
TRAVIS: 18.

1496
01:26:38,154 --> 01:26:47,474
MATT: 18. Makes his constitution save. So already
still wounded and bleeding from the dagger that

1497
01:26:47,474 --> 01:26:52,225
Vax left in him earlier, you manage to take the
blade down, sweeping across the front of its

1498
01:26:52,225 --> 01:26:57,243
armor, cutting and actually destroying and causing
this jagged edge to the front of its armored

1499
01:26:57,243 --> 01:26:59,227
breastplate. Make your next attack.

1500
01:26:59,227 --> 01:27:00,798
TRAVIS: The third one, let's do Great Weapon
Master.

1501
01:27:00,798 --> 01:27:03,158
MATT: Okay, go for it. With advantage.

1502
01:27:03,158 --> 01:27:05,545
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

1503
01:27:05,545 --> 01:27:09,145
LIAM: Orc down, orc down!

1504
01:27:09,145 --> 01:27:11,980
LAURA: Yes!

1505
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:14,564
MATT: Okay. So roll damage.

1506
01:27:14,564 --> 01:27:20,101
TRAVIS: 32.

1507
01:27:20,101 --> 01:27:24,549
MATT: So you multiply that by two. Right? Before
the modifier.

1508
01:27:24,549 --> 01:27:26,878
TRAVIS: Before the modifier, it was--

1509
01:27:26,878 --> 01:27:29,771
MATT: 2d6, which you rolled what?

1510
01:27:29,771 --> 01:27:35,875
TRAVIS: I rolled a 12. Or no, it was seven plus
five and then my rage modifier.

1511
01:27:35,875 --> 01:27:40,986
MATT: Right, so it's seven times two, so 14 plus
your modifier and your rage.

1512
01:27:40,986 --> 01:27:45,886
TRAVIS: Wow, which is ten now. And Great Weapon
Master is ten.

1513
01:27:45,886 --> 01:27:49,976
MATT: Right. So that's plus 20 is what you're
looking at on top of that.

1514
01:27:49,976 --> 01:27:50,946
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1515
01:27:50,946 --> 01:27:55,128
MATT: So 14 plus 20, 34, and then roll 4d6 on top
of that, Brutal Critical.

1516
01:27:55,128 --> 01:27:56,591
LAURA: What!

1517
01:27:56,591 --> 01:28:03,760
TRAVIS: Ten. No. 11.

1518
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,160
LAURA: 12.

1519
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:06,543
TRAVIS: Not 11, 12.

1520
01:28:06,543 --> 01:28:09,728
SAM: 47.

1521
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:11,554
MATT: How do you want to do this?

1522
01:28:11,554 --> 01:28:13,015
(cheering)

1523
01:28:13,015 --> 01:28:14,932
MATT: (laughs) Jesus.

1524
01:28:14,932 --> 01:28:23,799
TRAVIS: I would like to stick the hilt of Craven
Edge into the snow and reach forward and grab his

1525
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:26,739
shoulders and pull him onto the point of the
sword.

1526
01:28:26,739 --> 01:28:34,414
MATT: So you throw the blade down, handle-first,
it falls a little bit forward. You reach forward

1527
01:28:34,414 --> 01:28:40,852
and grab the war chief and pull him down onto the
blade. He looks up at you, staring into your face

1528
01:28:40,852 --> 01:28:44,129
the entire time as you pull him over each jagged
inch of the blade.

1529
01:28:44,129 --> 01:28:48,033
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's see the light leave those
eyes.

1530
01:28:48,033 --> 01:28:58,005
MATT: The life expires as it falls forward on the
blade. Let me go ahead and make a constitution

1531
01:28:58,005 --> 01:29:02,240
save. That is 18, makes it.

1532
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:05,417
TRAVIS: That's it, that's my turn.

1533
01:29:05,417 --> 01:29:07,020
LAURA: That was a good turn.

1534
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:12,648
MATT: But he is done, that war chief is done. Well
done. That brings us to Vax.

1535
01:29:12,648 --> 01:29:17,735
LIAM: All right, I'm going to curve around to the
front of the tent I'm at and start aiming at the

1536
01:29:17,735 --> 01:29:20,241
larger orc who's whacking on Keyleth there.

1537
01:29:20,241 --> 01:29:23,078
MATT: All right, glancing at the tent by the way,
you do see there are a few people in there that are

1538
01:29:23,078 --> 01:29:25,913
still bound and shaking and trying to look out and
see what's happening.

1539
01:29:26,021 --> 01:29:30,151
LIAM: I see them, I note them, and I'm throwing
two daggers at the person attacking Keyleth, the thing.

1540
01:29:30,151 --> 01:29:31,387
MATT: All right.

1541
01:29:31,387 --> 01:29:36,841
LIAM: First one is, and I'm using-- I'm going to
use Luck. That's a point, straight up in the air.

1542
01:29:36,841 --> 01:29:38,221
LAURA: Yeah.

1543
01:29:38,221 --> 01:29:44,041
LIAM: Fuck, okay, the first one probably misses.
16, and I was using the minus five, so the first

1544
01:29:44,041 --> 01:29:45,393
one probably misses, 11.

1545
01:29:45,393 --> 01:29:46,672
MATT: Yes, that guy right there?

1546
01:29:46,672 --> 01:29:47,442
LIAM: Yeah.

1547
01:29:47,442 --> 01:29:48,738
MATT: Yeah, that misses unfortunately.

1548
01:29:48,738 --> 01:29:49,710
LIAM: All right, second one.

1549
01:29:49,710 --> 01:29:52,800
MATT: Or it doesn't miss, it hits him but it hits
the armor plates of his full plate, it's too, or

1550
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,259
the plate of the armor it's wearing is too strong
and the blade can't pierce it.

1551
01:29:55,259 --> 01:29:56,840
LIAM: Second one is a 26.

1552
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:57,851
MATT: That does hit.

1553
01:29:57,851 --> 01:30:00,547
LIAM: Which hits, and since he's up against
Keyleth I get sneak attack damage.

1554
01:30:00,547 --> 01:30:01,676
MATT: Correct.

1555
01:30:01,676 --> 01:30:11,320
LIAM: So here comes the damage. (counting) 25.

1556
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:20,527
MATT: 25. With that, the first one hits the armor
and streaks off and vanishes into the snow. The

1557
01:30:20,527 --> 01:30:25,310
guy turns around and looks over and looks at you
directly, grins, shrugging off the earth elemental

1558
01:30:25,310 --> 01:30:31,608
to his side, grabs his greataxe and begins to move
forward in a direction towards you angrily.

1559
01:30:31,608 --> 01:30:35,852
However, as you let loose the second dagger, it
catches him right in the center of the face,

1560
01:30:35,852 --> 01:30:41,548
embedding itself between his eyes, and one wanders
off as the momentum carries it forward three or

1561
01:30:41,548 --> 01:30:49,611
four steps. (thudding) And grinds its face into
the ground right before reaching you, into the

1562
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:56,276
fire. The body catches flame as soon as it lands,
collapsing into one of the campfires and it begins

1563
01:30:56,276 --> 01:30:57,711
to burn.

1564
01:30:57,711 --> 01:30:59,779
LIAM: Sorry, sweetheart. And I feel the dagger
go--

1565
01:30:59,779 --> 01:31:04,721
MATT: Yep, to the side of your Blinkback Belt. All
right, do you want to stay right there? You have

1566
01:31:04,721 --> 01:31:06,296
more movement if you want to use it.

1567
01:31:06,296 --> 01:31:08,187
LIAM: How much left? Like five or ten?

1568
01:31:08,187 --> 01:31:09,613
MATT: Three more squares, 15 feet.

1569
01:31:09,613 --> 01:31:14,852
LIAM: I'm going to walk up right up next to
Keyleth in front of the bear. One, can I go

1570
01:31:14,852 --> 01:31:16,094
diagonally?

1571
01:31:16,094 --> 01:31:17,623
MATT: Through the fire, you can if you want to.

1572
01:31:17,623 --> 01:31:18,811
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

1573
01:31:18,811 --> 01:31:21,680
MATT: Make an acrobatics check, go for it.

1574
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:23,724
LIAM: 27.

1575
01:31:23,724 --> 01:31:27,138
MATT: Okay, yeah, you basically run and leap up
over the body of the guy you just killed, using

1576
01:31:27,138 --> 01:31:31,065
him as a stepping stone, and you see ash and
embers (whoosh) out the side as the pressure

1577
01:31:31,065 --> 01:31:35,734
pushes him further into the fireplace. You leap in
the air, land next to the one orc that's attacking

1578
01:31:35,734 --> 01:31:40,095
Trinket and right next to where Keyleth is
currently standing as the earth elemental.

1579
01:31:40,095 --> 01:31:42,409
LAURA: Not unlike a raven taking flight.

1580
01:31:42,409 --> 01:31:45,553
LIAM: Aren't you far away?

1581
01:31:45,553 --> 01:31:47,812
TALIESIN: (uncannily good crow noises)

1582
01:31:47,812 --> 01:31:50,064
MATT: Percy, you're up. That was way too good.

1583
01:31:50,064 --> 01:31:52,605
TALIESIN: I've been paid good money for that.

1584
01:31:52,605 --> 01:31:53,886
MATT: Your turn.

1585
01:31:53,886 --> 01:31:55,147
TALIESIN: I can emote as a bird.

1586
01:31:55,147 --> 01:31:56,351
MARISHA: Whose? His.

1587
01:31:56,351 --> 01:31:57,449
MATT: Percy's turn, yeah.

1588
01:31:57,449 --> 01:32:00,267
TALIESIN: My turn. Look at that, is there only one
guy standing now?

1589
01:32:00,267 --> 01:32:02,219
MATT: There are two guys standing right now, and a
bear.

1590
01:32:02,219 --> 01:32:04,366
TALIESIN: Okay, I'll look at that guy who's right
in front of me--

1591
01:32:04,366 --> 01:32:08,386
MARISHA: Two guys and a bear with Charlie Sheen,
new to CBS.

1592
01:32:08,386 --> 01:32:10,399
MATT: Oh, disadvantage on your next roll.

1593
01:32:10,399 --> 01:32:13,390
LIAM: For the rest of the arc.

1594
01:32:13,390 --> 01:32:14,981
MATT: Percy, what've you got?

1595
01:32:14,981 --> 01:32:18,649
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a push shot, I haven't
tried a push shot before, I'm going to do a push

1596
01:32:18,649 --> 01:32:20,209
shot on that guy in front of me.

1597
01:32:20,209 --> 01:32:21,605
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

1598
01:32:21,605 --> 01:32:26,504
TALIESIN: That's 29.

1599
01:32:26,504 --> 01:32:27,923
MATT: 29 hits.

1600
01:32:27,923 --> 01:32:35,898
TALIESIN: All right, that's 13 points of damage
and he pushes directly away from me ten feet.

1601
01:32:35,898 --> 01:32:38,181
MATT: He does. Into the fire.

1602
01:32:38,181 --> 01:32:39,441
TALIESIN: Yep.

1603
01:32:39,441 --> 01:32:43,085
MATT: So it does 13 damage, runs back, falls onto
the body of the other orc that's currently now

1604
01:32:43,085 --> 01:32:50,214
engulfed in flames and catches fire himself. He
takes six points of fire damage on top of that.

1605
01:32:50,214 --> 01:32:53,135
and is currently in danger of catching fire.

1606
01:32:53,135 --> 01:32:58,461
TALIESIN: That's good. And then, let's see, the
bear is a still a problem, isn't he?

1607
01:32:58,461 --> 01:32:59,649
MATT: Yes.

1608
01:32:59,649 --> 01:33:02,888
TALIESIN: I'll sneak another shot at the bear.

1609
01:33:02,888 --> 01:33:04,436
MATT: Go for it.

1610
01:33:04,436 --> 01:33:12,355
TALIESIN: This is going to be a sharpshooter and a
trick shot, I can't take both at the same time,

1611
01:33:12,355 --> 01:33:13,730
can I, it's one or the other?

1612
01:33:13,730 --> 01:33:17,607
MATT: No, sharpshooter is your feat. Trick shot,
you can't take multiple trick shots, but you can

1613
01:33:17,607 --> 01:33:18,936
sharpshooter and--

1614
01:33:18,936 --> 01:33:20,814
TALIESIN: And trick shot. I'm going to
sharpshooter and trick shot.

1615
01:33:20,814 --> 01:33:22,325
MATT: Made a mistake once, we learned.

1616
01:33:22,325 --> 01:33:28,388
TALIESIN: And that's 23?

1617
01:33:28,388 --> 01:33:32,467
MATT: 23 hits. Big bear. It's not that hard to
hit.

1618
01:33:32,467 --> 01:33:37,756
TALIESIN: Not that hard to hit? Has to take a
constitution saving throw.

1619
01:33:37,756 --> 01:33:42,059
MATT: That is 11.

1620
01:33:42,059 --> 01:33:46,425
TALIESIN: No, he has disadvantage on attacks until
the end of his next turn.

1621
01:33:46,425 --> 01:33:47,555
MATT: Headshot?

1622
01:33:47,555 --> 01:33:48,549
TALIESIN: Yep.

1623
01:33:48,549 --> 01:33:50,673
MATT: All right, so you go ahead and roll damage
for that.

1624
01:33:50,673 --> 01:33:52,635
MARISHA: Is this against the bear?

1625
01:33:52,635 --> 01:33:55,619
TALIESIN: Yeah. 25 points of damage.

1626
01:33:55,619 --> 01:34:00,527
MATT: 25 points of damage. You-- after you fire,
the one orc stumbling back and catching flames,

1627
01:34:00,527 --> 01:34:05,797
you turn around and look at the bear. Fire again,
it strikes the front of its bony ridge on its

1628
01:34:05,797 --> 01:34:12,578
head, where the brow line is, shattering part of
the bone and causing it to rear back. Looks very

1629
01:34:12,578 --> 01:34:17,271
disoriented. It's still angry and ready to swipe,
but it doesn't really know where it's standing at

1630
01:34:17,271 --> 01:34:18,501
the moment.

1631
01:34:18,501 --> 01:34:21,313
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn through my action
surge really quickly and reload and take two more

1632
01:34:21,313 --> 01:34:23,537
shots. Two more sharpshooter shots, nothing
fancy.

1633
01:34:23,537 --> 01:34:24,949
MATT: Go for it. Against?

1634
01:34:24,949 --> 01:34:25,863
TALIESIN: The bear.

1635
01:34:25,863 --> 01:34:27,356
MATT: The bear? Go for it.

1636
01:34:27,356 --> 01:34:29,653
LIAM: Don't be a happy bear, be a sad bear.

1637
01:34:29,653 --> 01:34:30,938
TALIESIN: 23.

1638
01:34:30,938 --> 01:34:32,357
MATT: Hits.

1639
01:34:32,357 --> 01:34:34,574
TALIESIN: That's 20 points of damage.

1640
01:34:34,574 --> 01:34:35,749
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

1641
01:34:35,749 --> 01:34:42,669
MATT: That actually, with that shot, you aim for
the other part of the brow, release it, and with

1642
01:34:42,669 --> 01:34:47,428
that it shatters part of the bear's face. You hit
a part of the bone ridge that causes the front of

1643
01:34:47,428 --> 01:34:50,788
the skull to break, and you can see part of its
face collapses a bit as the bear,

1644
01:34:50,788 --> 01:34:52,422
in a pile on the ground.

1645
01:34:52,422 --> 01:34:53,758
LAURA: No!

1646
01:34:53,758 --> 01:34:55,456
TALIESIN: So I have one last shot.

1647
01:34:55,456 --> 01:34:56,415
MATT: You do.

1648
01:34:56,415 --> 01:35:00,687
TALIESIN: Can I spend a grit to try and shoot the
rope that's holding that guy in the tree?

1649
01:35:00,687 --> 01:35:03,201
MATT: Yeah. You have disadvantage if you do.

1650
01:35:03,201 --> 01:35:04,806
TALIESIN: Disadvantage. Grit or no grit?

1651
01:35:04,806 --> 01:35:06,640
MATT: Oh, oh sorry, to use a grit point...

1652
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:10,150
TALIESIN: I can actually technically get advantage
on the shot.

1653
01:35:10,150 --> 01:35:12,190
MATT: I was going to say, you could, yeah. So if
you want to do that, go for it.

1654
01:35:12,190 --> 01:35:14,309
TALIESIN: Yeah, so I'll spend a grit point on
that.

1655
01:35:14,309 --> 01:35:18,870
Natural 20.

1656
01:35:18,870 --> 01:35:21,483
TRAVIS: Ah! The golden snitch.

1657
01:35:21,483 --> 01:35:28,498
MATT: With that, you aim, take a moment, fire the
bullet. You catch it in a way where it doesn't

1658
01:35:28,498 --> 01:35:36,286
completely cut the rope, it's one of those rare
perfect shots where it takes two of the three

1659
01:35:36,286 --> 01:35:41,494
threads that holds the rope together, as they
untether, it causes his body to (creaks) and it

1660
01:35:41,494 --> 01:35:48,079
causes him to begin to sway a little bit. As the
counter-sway comes back, it snaps, and it manages

1661
01:35:48,079 --> 01:35:53,044
to catch him to hit the edge of the tree, fall
into a few branches that break his fall, and he

1662
01:35:53,044 --> 01:35:54,370
tumbles out.

1663
01:35:54,370 --> 01:35:55,336
SAM: Ow!

1664
01:35:55,336 --> 01:35:57,545
MATT: Only taking one point of damage.

1665
01:35:57,545 --> 01:36:00,116
TALIESIN: Can't even kill a kitten with that.

1666
01:36:00,116 --> 01:36:01,741
MARISHA: Can't even kill a kitten.

1667
01:36:01,741 --> 01:36:03,598
MATT: That was a one in a million shot right
there.

1668
01:36:03,598 --> 01:36:05,050
TALIESIN: No, it was a one in 20 shot.

1669
01:36:05,050 --> 01:36:08,547
MATT: One in 20 for you, yeah. One in a million
for anybody else. But you're Percival.

1670
01:36:08,547 --> 01:36:10,619
TALIESIN: I'm cool.

1671
01:36:10,619 --> 01:36:13,353
MATT: Okay, cool. That brings us to Keyleth,
you're up.

1672
01:36:13,353 --> 01:36:14,632
MARISHA: Who's left alive?

1673
01:36:14,632 --> 01:36:20,203
MATT: There are two orcs, one that's currently on
fire and down in the flame trying to pull itself

1674
01:36:20,203 --> 01:36:25,191
up. The other is currently whaling on Grog out of
anger, but is starting to look around and notice

1675
01:36:25,191 --> 01:36:28,333
it's not a very good situation.

1676
01:36:28,333 --> 01:36:30,425
TRAVIS: No no, stay, we've got party favors.

1677
01:36:30,425 --> 01:36:31,560
MATT: Keyleth, what have you got?

1678
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:33,393
MARISHA: Are we still trying to keep one alive?

1679
01:36:33,393 --> 01:36:34,441
SAM: Sure we are.

1680
01:36:34,441 --> 01:36:35,627
MARISHA: Sure. All right.

1681
01:36:35,627 --> 01:36:38,666
TALIESIN: I assume the one that isn't on fire, but
you know, that's my opinion.

1682
01:36:38,666 --> 01:36:44,547
MARISHA: Yeah, sure. I want to earth glide
underneath and pop up underneath of him.

1683
01:36:44,547 --> 01:36:46,683
MATT: This guy here?

1684
01:36:46,683 --> 01:36:48,715
MARISHA: The fire guy, yeah.

1685
01:36:48,715 --> 01:36:56,255
MATT: The fire guy. He's actually on top of
another larger orc, so you burst through, the fire

1686
01:36:56,255 --> 01:37:00,856
is destroyed and you see a bunch of the stone is
thrown aside, what was the campfire has now been

1687
01:37:00,856 --> 01:37:04,856
detonated in a burst of snow and earth. You burst
out. Are you catching him?

1688
01:37:04,856 --> 01:37:07,491
MARISHA: Yeah. That's cool.

1689
01:37:07,491 --> 01:37:12,116
MATT: So you burst up, the bigger orc body then
rolls off onto the ground and keeps smoldering.

1690
01:37:12,116 --> 01:37:15,503
You catch the guy who's on fire, currently holding
him above you. What are you going to do?

1691
01:37:15,503 --> 01:37:21,219
MARISHA: First, I want to stamp him out in the
fire, in the snow, sorry. Stamp out his fire in

1692
01:37:21,219 --> 01:37:22,432
the snow.

1693
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:31,468
MATT: You're clutching him. He's flailing about in
your grip. Fire's out.

1694
01:37:31,468 --> 01:37:37,842
MARISHA: And then I'm going to, I want to grapple
onto him. I want to start dragging him over to

1695
01:37:37,842 --> 01:37:39,191
this nearby tree.

1696
01:37:39,191 --> 01:37:41,070
MATT: So make a grapple check, it's an athletics.

1697
01:37:41,070 --> 01:37:42,190
MARISHA: Athletics?

1698
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:43,296
MATT: Yep.

1699
01:37:43,296 --> 01:37:45,502
MARISHA: I've only got basic stats here.

1700
01:37:45,502 --> 01:37:47,232
MATT: Roll a d20, add your strength modifier.

1701
01:37:47,232 --> 01:37:51,447
MARISHA: Oh. 19. 20, 20.

1702
01:37:51,447 --> 01:37:56,179
MATT: He rolled a one. Yep. Through the flames and
the chaos, he can't even resist, and you have him

1703
01:37:56,179 --> 01:37:59,119
in a full grapple. He's not restrained, he can
still attack, but he's at disadvantage on all his

1704
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:03,430
attacks, but he can't move, his movement is zero
and you're currently holding him in place.

1705
01:38:03,430 --> 01:38:06,686
MARISHA: Okay. Can I start dragging him over so--

1706
01:38:06,686 --> 01:38:11,721
MATT: At half-speed, yeah, you've already done 20
feet to get there, so you can move him ten feet.

1707
01:38:11,721 --> 01:38:19,184
MARISHA: Okay. I'll slowly start dragging him to
this tree over here. So we can tie him up.

1708
01:38:19,184 --> 01:38:21,249
MATT: One, two. That's as far as you can drag him
there.

1709
01:38:21,249 --> 01:38:22,312
MARISHA: Okay.

1710
01:38:22,312 --> 01:38:24,720
MATT: As you're pulling him back, and he's like,
(struggling noises).

1711
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:25,938
MARISHA: Come on.

1712
01:38:25,938 --> 01:38:27,720
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Vex, you're
up.

1713
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:31,476
LAURA: All right, I'm going to turn Trinket
around, he's going to attack that dude that got a

1714
01:38:31,476 --> 01:38:34,260
hit on him. The one behind him.

1715
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:38,801
MATT: Right here? Oh, the one behind him is the
one that currently is being dragged away after

1716
01:38:38,801 --> 01:38:39,846
being set on fire.

1717
01:38:39,846 --> 01:38:40,805
LAURA: Oh shit.

1718
01:38:40,805 --> 01:38:41,759
TRAVIS: There's one on me.

1719
01:38:41,759 --> 01:38:44,652
LAURA: Okay, he runs up to the one on Grog. But he
moves out of the way so that I can get a clean

1720
01:38:44,652 --> 01:38:45,570
shot on him.

1721
01:38:45,570 --> 01:38:46,903
MATT: Okay. Moves around.

1722
01:38:46,903 --> 01:38:51,181
LAURA: And he bites him and he claws him!

1723
01:38:51,181 --> 01:38:52,306
MATT: Go for it!

1724
01:38:52,306 --> 01:38:53,355
LAURA: Okay.

1725
01:38:53,355 --> 01:38:54,551
MATT: This is your bonus action?

1726
01:38:54,551 --> 01:38:55,610
LAURA: Huh?

1727
01:38:55,610 --> 01:38:57,365
MATT: You're giving him the attack on the bonus
action?

1728
01:38:57,365 --> 01:39:00,270
LAURA: I still get a bonus action, he gets to
attack and I get to attack.

1729
01:39:00,270 --> 01:39:04,303
MATT: Okay, so yeah, so you get one attack and he
gets both attacks. Go for it.

1730
01:39:04,303 --> 01:39:09,676
LAURA: Yeah, he gets two attacks because of
Bestial Fury. Gosh darn it! That one's good, okay.

1731
01:39:09,676 --> 01:39:11,954
He bites the shit out of him.

1732
01:39:11,954 --> 01:39:13,572
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll damage on
that.

1733
01:39:13,572 --> 01:39:17,171
TRAVIS: (laughs) "Gosh darn it!"

1734
01:39:17,171 --> 01:39:24,266
LAURA: What is that, 13? No, 12.

1735
01:39:24,266 --> 01:39:26,550
MATT: 12, all right.

1736
01:39:26,550 --> 01:39:30,163
LAURA: And then I'm going to shoot him from my
hiding spot.

1737
01:39:30,163 --> 01:39:35,181
MATT: Okay. So you dart out from behind the
tree and release an arrow, go for it.

1738
01:39:35,181 --> 01:39:36,503
LAURA: All right.

1739
01:39:36,503 --> 01:39:37,632
LIAM: Get it, girl.

1740
01:39:37,632 --> 01:39:38,817
SAM: Don't hit me.

1741
01:39:38,817 --> 01:39:39,980
LIAM: That's all right.

1742
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:41,528
LAURA: 20.

1743
01:39:41,528 --> 01:39:43,375
MATT: 20 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1744
01:39:43,375 --> 01:39:50,920
LAURA: Great. 16 plus sneak attack. 19.

1745
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:56,838
MATT: 19 points of damage. This arrow strikes him
in the side of the throat, he gurgles and falls on

1746
01:39:56,838 --> 01:40:01,711
the ground. As he's trying to grab, Trinket uses
that and pounces on top and rips out, tears its

1747
01:40:01,711 --> 01:40:02,798
throat out.

1748
01:40:02,798 --> 01:40:04,361
LAURA and TRAVIS: Yeah!

1749
01:40:04,361 --> 01:40:10,119
MATT: That orc is done. Currently, at this moment,
the camp is cleared out except for the one that

1750
01:40:10,119 --> 01:40:13,660
Keyleth's currently grappling, and you guys all
turn around and you can see now, there is the

1751
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:18,013
other tent still filled with people. The other two
here disappear into the mansion's doorway.

1752
01:40:18,013 --> 01:40:20,404
MARISHA: (rock voice) Grog.

1753
01:40:20,404 --> 01:40:26,012
TRAVIS: Oh, sweet, yeah, hold on. You hold one
end, I'll hold the other. Wait. No, that might be

1754
01:40:26,012 --> 01:40:32,936
something-- never mind. And I take out Craven
Edge. I walk up to the orc that she's holding.

1755
01:40:32,936 --> 01:40:35,697
MARISHA: And I put him in a nice little sleeper
hold.

1756
01:40:35,697 --> 01:40:42,292
TRAVIS: Yeah, look, mate. So unless you want to
bleed or lose the head that's attached to your

1757
01:40:42,292 --> 01:40:46,847
body, are there more of you around these parts?

1758
01:40:46,847 --> 01:40:49,734
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

1759
01:40:49,734 --> 01:40:51,798
SAM: I don't think he can understand you, Grog.

1760
01:40:51,798 --> 01:40:53,239
TRAVIS: He speaks fear.

1761
01:40:53,239 --> 01:40:54,507
SAM: Oh.

1762
01:40:54,507 --> 01:40:57,074
TRAVIS: I get advantage on those because I--

1763
01:40:57,074 --> 01:40:59,490
MATT: Because of Craven Edge, yeah.

1764
01:40:59,490 --> 01:41:04,794
TRAVIS: 25.

1765
01:41:04,794 --> 01:41:12,153
MATT: The orc's looking at you, and while it was
putting on a brave face, as soon as you approach,

1766
01:41:12,153 --> 01:41:18,341
holding out Craven Edge, your muscles rippling
with the arcane strength of the blade that his

1767
01:41:18,341 --> 01:41:23,392
fallen friends have imbued you with, as each step
happens the shadows that drift off the blade begin

1768
01:41:23,392 --> 01:41:28,186
to drift up your arm and off your shoulder, and
from his perspective the whole world goes dark

1769
01:41:28,186 --> 01:41:33,834
around you as you take each step. And that grimace
on the orc's face falls into fight-or-flight fear.

1770
01:41:33,834 --> 01:41:40,891
He says, "No. We are the only ones. I am the only
one."

1771
01:41:40,891 --> 01:41:46,447
TRAVIS: Have you had any dealings with the
goliaths that are in Westruun?

1772
01:41:46,447 --> 01:41:54,676
MATT: "We don't deal with goliaths." Spits blood,
but it can only get, with what little bit of strength

1773
01:41:54,676 --> 01:41:57,617
it has left, only dribbles down the chin in a
not-very-aggressive way.

1774
01:41:57,617 --> 01:41:58,992
TRAVIS: Anything else?

1775
01:41:58,992 --> 01:42:04,862
SAM: Yeah, we need to know, wait. Does he know
anything else? Is there another camp, is there

1776
01:42:04,862 --> 01:42:05,796
anything?

1777
01:42:05,796 --> 01:42:06,766
TALIESIN: No.

1778
01:42:06,766 --> 01:42:07,796
SAM: They just had some prisoners?

1779
01:42:07,796 --> 01:42:08,719
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1780
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:12,485
TRAVIS: Yeah, is there any reason why I should
leave you alive? (laughs) I love this question.

1781
01:42:12,485 --> 01:42:26,352
MATT: He goes, "No. I should go to whoever made
us. I will die here with my brethren. I will not

1782
01:42:26,352 --> 01:42:27,987
"run a coward."

1783
01:42:27,987 --> 01:42:30,674
LIAM: Has he seen a cave with a sphinx in it?

1784
01:42:30,674 --> 01:42:32,071
SAM: Yeah, sphinx?

1785
01:42:32,071 --> 01:42:40,507
TRAVIS: Before I dispatch you to your maker, have
you seen a sphinx or a cave of magical origin

1786
01:42:40,507 --> 01:42:42,179
around these parts?

1787
01:42:42,179 --> 01:42:47,370
MATT: "Rot in Kord's prison, half-giant."

1788
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:54,882
TRAVIS: And I take Craven Edge and I grab both of
his ankles, and I pull them apart and I shove the

1789
01:42:54,882 --> 01:42:59,332
blade up under his grundle, and then rip one of
his legs off.

1790
01:42:59,332 --> 01:43:04,121
MATT: It's a horrific display. Even the earth
elemental takes a step back.

1791
01:43:04,121 --> 01:43:07,740
TALIESIN: Cool.

1792
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:09,650
MATT: Fails the constitution saving throw.

1793
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:10,628
TRAVIS: Yes!

1794
01:43:10,628 --> 01:43:14,105
LAURA: While that was going on, I wanted to run
forward and work on the guy that fell from the

1795
01:43:14,105 --> 01:43:17,273
tree. I wasn't paying attention to that.

1796
01:43:17,273 --> 01:43:20,035
MATT: Yeah, Pike has gone over to help, and he's
pretty messed up, but Pike's already gotten to him

1797
01:43:20,035 --> 01:43:23,560
at this point while this is happening. You come
over and aid and manage to keep him from dying.

1798
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:25,946
He's unconscious, still, and he slowly comes to
consciousness--

1799
01:43:25,946 --> 01:43:28,103
LAURA: Does he look like the description that we
got?

1800
01:43:28,103 --> 01:43:34,662
MATT: Yeah, it's Cyrus. Bloodied, horribly
brutalized, but alive. What's your strength at now?

1801
01:43:34,662 --> 01:43:40,429
TRAVIS: Plus four to attack and plus 11 for
damage.

1802
01:43:40,429 --> 01:43:41,945
MATT: What's your strength score at?

1803
01:43:41,945 --> 01:43:48,173
TRAVIS: Oh, score. It is now 21.

1804
01:43:48,173 --> 01:43:51,045
MATT: 21, nice. Fuck, dude.

1805
01:43:51,045 --> 01:43:52,543
LAURA: You're stronger than Pike again.

1806
01:43:52,543 --> 01:43:54,082
TRAVIS: Yeah, only for a little bit.

1807
01:43:54,082 --> 01:43:56,252
MATT: All righty.

1808
01:43:56,252 --> 01:43:58,069
MARISHA: Are there any other prisoners still tied
up?

1809
01:43:58,069 --> 01:44:01,025
SAM: Yeah, I'm in the other tent untying them.

1810
01:44:01,025 --> 01:44:04,447
MATT: Yeah, there's three more in this side over
here, you guys were--

1811
01:44:04,447 --> 01:44:07,339
SAM: Calming them down, looking for loot.

1812
01:44:07,339 --> 01:44:08,404
TRAVIS: 20.

1813
01:44:08,404 --> 01:44:11,715
MARISHA: I was going to say, before I drop my
earth elemental form I start busting open some of

1814
01:44:11,715 --> 01:44:14,942
these crates for quick lootage.

1815
01:44:14,942 --> 01:44:19,714
MATT: You should have a higher strength than 20 if
you kept it from the last basilisk fight. Because

1816
01:44:19,714 --> 01:44:23,042
you're 17, you got how many bonuses from that
combat?

1817
01:44:23,042 --> 01:44:27,605
TRAVIS: Seven from-- without the short rest, so
it's been seven?

1818
01:44:27,605 --> 01:44:30,835
MATT: You've got seven bonus benefits.

1819
01:44:30,835 --> 01:44:31,852
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1820
01:44:31,852 --> 01:44:33,953
MATT: So you're 24 then, aren't you?

1821
01:44:33,953 --> 01:44:36,131
TRAVIS: No, only 21, because it takes two to go up
the thing, right?

1822
01:44:36,131 --> 01:44:37,301
LAURA: No--

1823
01:44:37,301 --> 01:44:38,641
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

1824
01:44:38,641 --> 01:44:45,807
MATT: Okay. So. Every time they fail a saving
throw, your strength goes up by one. Every two

1825
01:44:45,807 --> 01:44:47,893
strength, you get a bonus.

1826
01:44:47,893 --> 01:44:48,991
TRAVIS: Oh.

1827
01:44:48,991 --> 01:44:50,216
MATT: That's how it works.

1828
01:44:50,216 --> 01:44:51,942
TRAVIS: Oh. I'm at 24.

1829
01:44:51,942 --> 01:44:53,427
MATT: So your strength is 24.

1830
01:44:53,427 --> 01:44:55,525
MARISHA: (laughs) That's awesome!

1831
01:44:55,525 --> 01:44:59,451
MATT: Which means your overall strength bonus
should be plus seven.

1832
01:44:59,451 --> 01:45:01,531
LIAM: Juicing, man, he's juicing.

1833
01:45:01,531 --> 01:45:06,306
TRAVIS: I'm going to turn that plus four to a plus
seven.

1834
01:45:06,306 --> 01:45:10,528
MATT: Because your strength modifier normally is
plus three, correct?

1835
01:45:10,528 --> 01:45:11,372
TRAVIS: Correct.

1836
01:45:11,372 --> 01:45:16,587
MATT: At 17. With every even number it goes up,
and it goes up one point by each time you steal a

1837
01:45:16,587 --> 01:45:22,769
strength. Every two that you, every time it hits
an even number, 18, 20, 22, 24, the modifier goes

1838
01:45:22,769 --> 01:45:27,267
up by one. So yeah, if you're strength's at 24 right
now, your overall strength modifier is plus seven.

1839
01:45:27,267 --> 01:45:32,073
So it would be a plus four on top of whatever your
normal attacking damage was already.

1840
01:45:32,073 --> 01:45:33,453
LAURA: Wow.

1841
01:45:33,453 --> 01:45:35,802
TALIESIN: So your strength saving throw goes up by
one.

1842
01:45:35,802 --> 01:45:37,953
TRAVIS: So plus four is correct. I had plus four
down. Okay, got it. Got it, got it, got it.

1843
01:45:37,953 --> 01:45:39,196
MATT: Plus four on top of what you had normally,
yes.

1844
01:45:39,196 --> 01:45:40,453
TRAVIS: On what I had normally.

1845
01:45:40,453 --> 01:45:44,141
LIAM: Let's get this camp cleared and get these
people inside Scanlan's love shack.

1846
01:45:44,141 --> 01:45:51,594
MATT: As you're untying them, they're all, "Thank
you, thank you so much, they took us in the night,

1847
01:45:51,594 --> 01:45:56,640
"we didn't know, we thought we were dead." And some
of them start breaking down into tears. There's a

1848
01:45:56,640 --> 01:46:01,779
little girl in there that amongst everyone is
probably the most stalwart, and is trying to calm

1849
01:46:01,779 --> 01:46:06,635
one of the men that's sobbing, she's like, "It's
okay, it's okay." And is patting him on the shoulder.

1850
01:46:06,635 --> 01:46:08,505
MARISHA: It's always the kids, man. It's always
the kids.

1851
01:46:08,505 --> 01:46:10,361
LAURA: Are you survivors of Westruun?

1852
01:46:10,361 --> 01:46:18,641
MATT: "Yes. We were up by the base and they came
in the night and they killed my wife and they took

1853
01:46:18,641 --> 01:46:20,929
"me. They took everything."

1854
01:46:20,929 --> 01:46:22,592
LAURA: You're safe now.

1855
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:25,071
MATT: "Thank you."

1856
01:46:25,071 --> 01:46:26,370
LAURA: As is your camp.

1857
01:46:26,370 --> 01:46:28,822
MATT: "Thank you."

1858
01:46:28,822 --> 01:46:34,378
TRAVIS: If I could ask, have you seen-- fuck,
Wilhand?

1859
01:46:34,378 --> 01:46:35,362
SAM: Wilhand?

1860
01:46:35,362 --> 01:46:36,808
TRAVIS: Yeah, Wilhand. Yeah.

1861
01:46:36,808 --> 01:46:38,903
LAURA: Small, older, gnomish fellow?

1862
01:46:38,903 --> 01:46:46,072
MATT: The little girl pipes up and goes, "Yeah,
yeah, Wilhand. He was as tall as me."

1863
01:46:46,072 --> 01:46:52,133
TRAVIS: I drop down to my knees. You seem very
brave. Do you know where Wilhand has gone?

1864
01:46:52,133 --> 01:46:57,148
MATT: "I haven't seen him since we left town."

1865
01:46:57,148 --> 01:46:59,451
LAURA: So he stayed in the town.

1866
01:46:59,451 --> 01:47:02,074
MATT: "I haven't seen him outside of it."

1867
01:47:02,074 --> 01:47:04,567
SAM: Oh, the town. We were in the camp. Okay.

1868
01:47:04,567 --> 01:47:06,418
LAURA: What's your name, darling?

1869
01:47:06,418 --> 01:47:08,397
MATT: "Vanessa."

1870
01:47:08,397 --> 01:47:10,971
LAURA: Vanessa. You're very strong, Vanessa.

1871
01:47:10,971 --> 01:47:14,476
MATT: "Thank you. You're very strong too."

1872
01:47:14,476 --> 01:47:21,969
LAURA: Oh, well, thank you. Do you like bears? Not
those scary ones but really nice ones?

1873
01:47:21,969 --> 01:47:26,750
MATT: And you see she's a little-- bears are a
rough subject for her, she's probably seen them

1874
01:47:26,750 --> 01:47:28,449
eat a few people she knew.

1875
01:47:28,449 --> 01:47:34,526
LAURA: Trinket sits back. He's friendly.

1876
01:47:34,526 --> 01:47:38,897
TRAVIS: He's super cuddly. And I run over and I
put Trinket in a headlock and give him a noogie.

1877
01:47:38,897 --> 01:47:41,514
See? Totally nice.

1878
01:47:41,514 --> 01:47:46,399
MATT: Trinket breaks free and licks you right
across the face, your beard up to the side again.

1879
01:47:46,399 --> 01:47:47,900
TRAVIS: Here we go again.

1880
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:49,986
MATT: She chuckles.

1881
01:47:49,986 --> 01:47:54,563
MARISHA: I drop elemental form and start helping
Pike heal whoever needs healing.

1882
01:47:54,563 --> 01:47:55,674
MATT: Okay.

1883
01:47:55,674 --> 01:47:57,546
LAURA: I go for that circlet that was on the war
chief.

1884
01:47:57,546 --> 01:47:58,654
TRAVIS: Oh, good call.

1885
01:47:58,654 --> 01:48:00,129
LIAM: Grog.

1886
01:48:00,129 --> 01:48:01,309
TRAVIS: Yeah?

1887
01:48:01,309 --> 01:48:02,596
LAURA: I inspect it first.

1888
01:48:02,596 --> 01:48:08,843
LIAM: We should bury the dead. There's piles of
dead, we should bury them.

1889
01:48:08,843 --> 01:48:10,896
LAURA: Was it human bodies or animal bodies?

1890
01:48:10,896 --> 01:48:12,631
MATT: They were human bodies.

1891
01:48:12,631 --> 01:48:14,029
TRAVIS: Yeah, of course, you're right.

1892
01:48:14,029 --> 01:48:17,652
LIAM: We'll put them in the pit and then we'll
cover it up. Gimme a hand.

1893
01:48:17,652 --> 01:48:19,689
TRAVIS: Yeah. Whatever you need.

1894
01:48:19,689 --> 01:48:22,348
MATT: The rest of the people, while you guys are
doing this, have been escorted into the mansion.

1895
01:48:22,348 --> 01:48:27,817
They're all in there being cleaned up, the
servants are tending to them, and I mean, they'll

1896
01:48:27,817 --> 01:48:30,286
be shat out of there in 24 hours, but--

1897
01:48:30,286 --> 01:48:32,959
SAM: It's fine. They'll have a good night's
sleep.

1898
01:48:32,959 --> 01:48:37,594
MATT: At this point you hear a voice in the
distance say, "Hey! Is everything all right?"

1899
01:48:37,594 --> 01:48:39,696
LAURA: Oh, quite, come on over!

1900
01:48:39,696 --> 01:48:47,284
MATT: Walking out from behind a tree, a one-armed
man. He comes running over. "I heard a lot of

1901
01:48:47,284 --> 01:48:51,246
"craziness going on. Those-- you did good, saw a
little bit of it."

1902
01:48:51,246 --> 01:48:53,246
SAM: Did you have to use your dagger at all?

1903
01:48:53,246 --> 01:48:56,181
MATT: "No, but I kept it there just in case." And
he's still clutching it in his hand.

1904
01:48:56,181 --> 01:48:59,802
TRAVIS: There's one standing behind you right
now.

1905
01:48:59,802 --> 01:49:04,591
MATT: (yelps) Spins around and swings it, loses
his grip of it, and it (dagger flying) into the

1906
01:49:04,591 --> 01:49:07,062
tree, and he's like, runs over, grabs it.

1907
01:49:07,062 --> 01:49:12,041
TRAVIS: Nobody saw that. Totally cool.

1908
01:49:12,041 --> 01:49:18,467
MATT: "Okay, thank you." So you guys begin taking
the bodies over and putting them into the pit on

1909
01:49:18,467 --> 01:49:23,411
top of the orc that you blew most of the forehead
off of.

1910
01:49:23,411 --> 01:49:27,228
TALIESIN: Two orcs, what did we, two--

1911
01:49:27,228 --> 01:49:29,059
MARISHA: Two dryads.

1912
01:49:29,059 --> 01:49:30,830
TALIESIN: Two dryads, two orcs.

1913
01:49:30,830 --> 01:49:32,684
LAURA: The circlet?

1914
01:49:32,684 --> 01:49:35,238
MATT: Well, the dryads have vanished by now at
this point, the magic. You inspect the circlet,

1915
01:49:35,238 --> 01:49:40,986
the circlet is more of adornment, looks like it
was a symbol of power, does not appear to have

1916
01:49:40,986 --> 01:49:46,910
anything magical about it, but the uncut gem in
the center appears to be a raw ruby, probably

1917
01:49:46,910 --> 01:49:56,105
worth about 150 gold in its current form. You also
find on their bodies overall, from the ones that

1918
01:49:56,105 --> 01:50:02,867
you have access to, an additional 230 gold pieces.
And amongst the goods that have been gathered

1919
01:50:02,867 --> 01:50:10,576
here, if you should wish to return them or keep
them for yourself, there is roughly 700 gold

1920
01:50:10,576 --> 01:50:16,354
pieces amongst the other bits of dried food,
starting-to-rot vegetables.

1921
01:50:16,354 --> 01:50:19,062
SAM: There's a couple boars, right?

1922
01:50:19,062 --> 01:50:22,622
MATT: There are a couple boars that were dragged
in, that have been killed.

1923
01:50:22,622 --> 01:50:27,295
TALIESIN: Let's eat the food that won't last and
return, cook the boar and return.

1924
01:50:27,295 --> 01:50:28,692
MATT: There is one unspoiled fire.

1925
01:50:28,692 --> 01:50:31,074
MARISHA: Yeah, can we take a short rest?

1926
01:50:31,074 --> 01:50:36,356
TALIESIN: We can also bring the food into the
mansion and let the help cook it.

1927
01:50:36,356 --> 01:50:39,171
SAM: That's true. How about the casks, what's in
the casks?

1928
01:50:39,171 --> 01:50:47,632
MATT: There are four casks of varying size, there
are two large, large casks, there's one giant

1929
01:50:47,632 --> 01:50:53,470
grain barrel, there's one barrel that appears to
be of a standard ale, and there are two smaller

1930
01:50:53,470 --> 01:51:00,433
wine barrels. Only one of them appears to be
labeled, or at least hasn't been fully rubbed off.

1931
01:51:00,433 --> 01:51:08,325
They're nothing special, these are probably
grabbed by whoever ran a tavern in Westruun and

1932
01:51:08,325 --> 01:51:10,040
took what they could during the chaos.

1933
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:11,865
TRAVIS: All ale and wine is special.

1934
01:51:11,865 --> 01:51:13,338
MATT: Fair enough.

1935
01:51:13,338 --> 01:51:19,298
SAM: We should take that, and wait, this meat, don't we
have a cold bag? Don't we have a cooler?

1936
01:51:19,298 --> 01:51:20,325
TRAVIS: We do!

1937
01:51:20,325 --> 01:51:22,373
SAM: Let's keep some meat.

1938
01:51:22,395 --> 01:51:23,301
TRAVIS: That nothing is in!

1939
01:51:23,301 --> 01:51:24,593
LAURA: No, we do have some stuff in it.

1940
01:51:24,593 --> 01:51:25,883
TRAVIS: Some stuff is in it!

1941
01:51:25,883 --> 01:51:27,501
SAM: Keep some grain and meat or something.

1942
01:51:27,501 --> 01:51:29,677
LAURA: All right, yeah, I'm keeping some boar
meat.

1943
01:51:29,677 --> 01:51:34,214
MARISHA: But seriously, I eat some because I'm--
Keyleth's a little hungry.

1944
01:51:34,214 --> 01:51:36,351
LAURA: I thought you were a vegetarian.

1945
01:51:36,351 --> 01:51:39,202
MARISHA: No, never said that.

1946
01:51:39,202 --> 01:51:41,189
TRAVIS: Can I try and roughly butcher this boar?

1947
01:51:41,189 --> 01:51:45,022
MATT: You've done it pretty well. You butcher the
boar, there's already a stump set up for you,

1948
01:51:45,022 --> 01:51:50,343
previously used for not quite as humane reasons,
but you manage to prepare the boar, cook it over

1949
01:51:50,343 --> 01:51:55,606
the area here. As the sun slowly begins to set,
you guys take your short rest. Is everyone taking

1950
01:51:55,606 --> 01:51:56,849
a short rest?

1951
01:51:56,849 --> 01:51:57,997
TRAVIS: Not me, not me.

1952
01:51:57,997 --> 01:52:00,569
MATT: Okay, so you maintain your damage, you still
maintain your--

1953
01:52:00,569 --> 01:52:03,962
SAM: Wait, the sun is setting, are we taking a
short rest or a long rest? Are we spending the night?

1954
01:52:03,962 --> 01:52:05,187
LIAM: Can't we go in your house?

1955
01:52:05,187 --> 01:52:07,849
SAM: Of course we can, yeah. Are we going to spend
the night? What time is it?

1956
01:52:07,849 --> 01:52:12,521
MATT: It's about five o'clock in the afternoon.

1957
01:52:12,521 --> 01:52:14,087
SAM: Oh, little early.

1958
01:52:14,087 --> 01:52:18,032
LIAM: Let's pack it in early. Who knows what'll
happen tomorrow?

1959
01:52:18,032 --> 01:52:20,289
SAM: Are we going up to the mountain?

1960
01:52:20,289 --> 01:52:22,153
LIAM: Yeah, tomorrow morning.

1961
01:52:22,153 --> 01:52:25,751
SAM: All right. Do we need to scout up? How far to
the mountaintop?

1962
01:52:25,751 --> 01:52:27,542
TALIESIN: We're not going to the mountaintop.

1963
01:52:27,542 --> 01:52:29,523
SAM: Or the glowing place.

1964
01:52:29,523 --> 01:52:33,237
MATT: Where the beacon is? Keyleth would be the
one that knows, since she's the one who marked it.

1965
01:52:33,237 --> 01:52:37,218
It's probably about an hour and a half's travel on
foot to get there.

1966
01:52:37,218 --> 01:52:40,187
SAM: We should go check it out before we go to
bed, swing by on a broom or something.

1967
01:52:40,187 --> 01:52:41,748
LAURA: I like it. I'll hop on the broom.

1968
01:52:41,748 --> 01:52:42,654
MATT: Okay.

1969
01:52:42,654 --> 01:52:45,767
MARISHA: Wait, check it out and then? Your door is
stationary, though, right?

1970
01:52:45,767 --> 01:52:49,002
MATT: The door is stationary, the door is on the
outside of this camp.

1971
01:52:49,002 --> 01:52:50,646
TRAVIS: But everybody inside's safe.

1972
01:52:50,646 --> 01:52:51,640
LAURA: Yeah.

1973
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:53,060
TRAVIS: Do it.

1974
01:52:53,060 --> 01:52:54,824
LAURA: Can I stealth in the air?

1975
01:52:54,824 --> 01:52:57,188
MATT: Not really.

1976
01:52:57,188 --> 01:52:58,966
LAURA: Can I wrap myself in like my--

1977
01:52:58,966 --> 01:53:00,346
TRAVIS: What? Aluminum foil?

1978
01:53:00,346 --> 01:53:02,371
MATT: I mean, you will make a stealth check.

1979
01:53:02,371 --> 01:53:04,466
LIAM: You'll figure this broom out eventually.

1980
01:53:04,466 --> 01:53:10,611
MATT: I'm going to put it at disadvantage because
you are, it's possible, but you're also a giant

1981
01:53:10,611 --> 01:53:12,459
rocketing half-elf in the sky.

1982
01:53:12,459 --> 01:53:15,233
LAURA: I'm not that giant, okay?

1983
01:53:15,233 --> 01:53:17,992
TRAVIS: Wow. Wow.

1984
01:53:17,992 --> 01:53:19,971
MATT: Roll disadvantage.

1985
01:53:19,971 --> 01:53:22,549
LAURA: So I usually get advantage, so I'll just
roll regular.

1986
01:53:22,549 --> 01:53:28,615
TRAVIS: I love your broom rolls so much.

1987
01:53:28,615 --> 01:53:31,404
LAURA: Oh! Oh! You know what, I still have Pass
Without a Trace, because I never cast Hunter's

1988
01:53:31,404 --> 01:53:33,247
Mark to break that concentration.

1989
01:53:33,247 --> 01:53:34,652
LIAM: You nerd.

1990
01:53:34,652 --> 01:53:37,495
TRAVIS: I would not remember that shit.

1991
01:53:37,495 --> 01:53:41,274
LAURA: 23.

1992
01:53:41,274 --> 01:53:47,790
MATT: 23. All right. Cool. Don't forget your point
of exhaustion, Grog. From the end of the frenzied rage.

1993
01:53:47,790 --> 01:53:49,608
TRAVIS: Yes, thank you.

1994
01:53:49,608 --> 01:53:56,892
SAM: I'm going to go with her. You're going on the
broom? Yeah, I'm going to turn into a mangy crow

1995
01:53:56,892 --> 01:53:58,899
that looks like it would be with a witch.

1996
01:53:58,899 --> 01:54:01,810
LAURA: I like it. (cackles)

1997
01:54:01,810 --> 01:54:04,174
SAM: I'll Polymorph.

1998
01:54:04,174 --> 01:54:05,988
MATT: Polymorph. You follow her as a crow.

1999
01:54:05,988 --> 01:54:09,009
SAM: And I perch on her shoulder. (crow sounds)

2000
01:54:09,009 --> 01:54:11,132
TALIESIN: (unnervingly realistic crow noises)

2001
01:54:11,132 --> 01:54:12,204
SAM: Thank you!

2002
01:54:12,204 --> 01:54:13,369
MATT: That's so creepy.

2003
01:54:13,369 --> 01:54:15,166
TALIESIN: (unnervingly realistic crow noises)

2004
01:54:15,166 --> 01:54:16,543
MATT: Perfect.

2005
01:54:16,543 --> 01:54:19,860
SAM: Wow. Thank you.

2006
01:54:19,860 --> 01:54:25,020
MATT: So as you continue cresting over the top of
the tree ridge, heading towards the direction that

2007
01:54:25,020 --> 01:54:31,506
Keyleth points out to you, you guys swoop down. As
the treeline comes to an end, the snow begins to

2008
01:54:31,506 --> 01:54:36,845
subside and you reach the base of the Stormpeak.
There, make a perception check,

2009
01:54:36,845 --> 01:54:38,536
both of you, actually.

2010
01:54:38,536 --> 01:54:41,211
SAM: Mine sucks. Natural one.

2011
01:54:41,211 --> 01:54:43,326
LAURA: I'm so scared of all my dice right now.

2012
01:54:43,326 --> 01:54:46,232
MATT: What you got?

2013
01:54:46,232 --> 01:54:47,607
LAURA: 17.

2014
01:54:47,607 --> 01:54:49,245
MATT: 17? Okay.

2015
01:54:49,245 --> 01:54:50,912
LAURA: Oh wait! Favored terrain.

2016
01:54:50,912 --> 01:54:52,316
MATT: Mountains?

2017
01:54:52,316 --> 01:54:54,009
SAM: You're in the air, though.

2018
01:54:54,009 --> 01:54:55,494
LAURA: Forest at the edge of the mountain.

2019
01:54:55,494 --> 01:54:59,090
MATT: Does not pertain to the forest, more of it's
the mountain.

2020
01:54:59,090 --> 01:55:00,278
LAURA: Okay. 17.

2021
01:55:00,278 --> 01:55:05,944
MATT: 17, okay. As the sun finally hits the edge
of the mountain range and begins to set, and the

2022
01:55:05,944 --> 01:55:09,455
light's starting to diminish, you're having a hard
time picking out details. You know the general

2023
01:55:09,455 --> 01:55:12,491
vicinity that Keyleth pointed at you, it takes
longer than you anticipated, but eventually you

2024
01:55:12,491 --> 01:55:17,851
come-- and there are a few small caves and
entrances to the side of this mountain, but after

2025
01:55:17,851 --> 01:55:22,364
you sweep past once or twice, doing a couple
loops, one catches your eye. You look at it from

2026
01:55:22,364 --> 01:55:28,512
this vantage point. It looks like a small inlet,
like a cavern. As you get closer, unlike the other

2027
01:55:28,512 --> 01:55:38,688
rough entrances, this one seems intentionally
carved in the mountainside in a triangle. Directly

2028
01:55:38,688 --> 01:55:43,277
about 30 feet to its peak, there is a triangular
entrance to the very very base of this mountain

2029
01:55:43,277 --> 01:55:47,025
that is recessed into the mountain rock itself.

2030
01:55:47,025 --> 01:55:50,343
LAURA: I don't think we should land on the ground,
we should just stay above.

2031
01:55:50,343 --> 01:55:52,054
SAM: (crow sounds)

2032
01:55:52,054 --> 01:55:53,769
TALIESIN: (realistic crow sounds)

2033
01:55:53,769 --> 01:55:55,047
LAURA: You can't talk when you're a bird?

2034
01:55:55,047 --> 01:55:56,191
MATT: He cannot.

2035
01:55:56,191 --> 01:56:02,195
LAURA: Oh. This is really smart, you coming,
because we can't do anything. Do you want to pop

2036
01:56:02,195 --> 01:56:12,365
out of that, can you pop back in? One caw for yes,
two caws for no. You can't even understand me

2037
01:56:12,365 --> 01:56:14,272
right now? This is ridiculous.

2038
01:56:14,272 --> 01:56:15,603
SAM: I don't know, can I understand her?

2039
01:56:15,603 --> 01:56:16,840
MATT: You can understand her, yeah.

2040
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:18,655
SAM: I'm just fucking with her, then.

2041
01:56:18,655 --> 01:56:20,275
(laughter)

2042
01:56:20,275 --> 01:56:22,153
MATT: But she doesn't know if you understand.

2043
01:56:22,153 --> 01:56:31,787
LAURA: I float down gracefully on the broom and
give it a little bit of a closer look.

2044
01:56:31,787 --> 01:56:42,398
MATT: Okay. As you pull down to the edge of the
tunnel, the cavern entrance, you can see the

2045
01:56:42,398 --> 01:56:48,929
relatively worn, through time and weathering, the
structure of the tunnel, even though it is

2046
01:56:48,929 --> 01:56:52,784
intentional, it has been there for a long time,
and you can see the effect that time has had on

2047
01:56:52,784 --> 01:57:03,029
it, from what was once a very pristine entrance.
Looking inside, it goes dark about 25 feet in. Do

2048
01:57:03,029 --> 01:57:04,660
you want to step further into the cavern?

2049
01:57:04,660 --> 01:57:06,283
LAURA: No no no, I'm still in the air, I'm not on
the ground.

2050
01:57:06,283 --> 01:57:10,502
MATT: Okay, so yeah, looking inside about 25 feet
past, what little bit of daylight that still exists

2051
01:57:10,502 --> 01:57:14,361
disappears into the shadow of the cavern, you
don't know anything beyond that.

2052
01:57:14,361 --> 01:57:19,474
LAURA: What do you think, Scanlan? Back up a
little bit and shoot a flaming arrow into that?

2053
01:57:19,474 --> 01:57:21,912
SAM: (caws)

2054
01:57:21,912 --> 01:57:29,187
LAURA: Sweet. I back up a little, far distance
away, and shoot a flaming arrow into it.

2055
01:57:29,187 --> 01:57:34,735
MATT: Okay, so you pull out your arrow, the shaft
ignites as you release it. It arcs forward and it

2056
01:57:34,735 --> 01:57:37,370
lights up a little bit of the tunnel around it,
tunnel continues--

2057
01:57:37,370 --> 01:57:38,924
LIAM: Good aim from the broom?

2058
01:57:38,924 --> 01:57:40,251
MATT: Decent aim.

2059
01:57:40,251 --> 01:57:41,134
LIAM: Okay.

2060
01:57:41,134 --> 01:57:44,415
MATT: I mean, it's not a wide target, she's
shooting it into an open 30-foot space.

2061
01:57:44,415 --> 01:57:47,635
LAURA: And it's not moving, it's not fucking
moving right now.

2062
01:57:47,635 --> 01:57:49,986
LIAM: I've watched Harry Potter, they always have
two hands on the broom.

2063
01:57:49,986 --> 01:57:53,057
LAURA: Why are you trying to do this to me right
now? Why you got to be a player hater?

2064
01:57:53,057 --> 01:57:54,224
LIAM: Because it's fun.

2065
01:57:54,224 --> 01:57:56,204
MATT: From the narrative standpoint, it's fine.
She could take another shot and it would make it

2066
01:57:56,204 --> 01:58:02,645
there anyway. You can see it go through, and it
arcs and then disappears. You see what looks like

2067
01:58:02,645 --> 01:58:04,853
an edge, and it vanishes past it.

2068
01:58:04,853 --> 01:58:10,835
LAURA: Well. That looks deep. I don't think we
should check this out on our own.

2069
01:58:10,835 --> 01:58:13,424
SAM: Might be fun.

2070
01:58:13,424 --> 01:58:18,183
LAURA: You're a bird, you could probably fly in
and fly back out.

2071
01:58:18,183 --> 01:58:22,481
SAM: Sure. (caws) Okay, I'll fly in.

2072
01:58:22,481 --> 01:58:30,023
MATT: Okay. You head down, coasting into the
darkness. Does your form have--

2073
01:58:30,023 --> 01:58:32,204
SAM: I have darkvision, I don't know what crows
have.

2074
01:58:32,204 --> 01:58:34,775
MATT: If you have darkvision. But you, crows--

2075
01:58:34,775 --> 01:58:36,295
SAM: I don't know what a crow has.

2076
01:58:36,295 --> 01:58:38,939
MATT: I will look it up real fast.

2077
01:58:38,939 --> 01:58:40,471
TALIESIN: I don't think a crow has darkvision.

2078
01:58:40,471 --> 01:58:41,474
MATT: Hold on, hold on.

2079
01:58:41,474 --> 01:58:43,189
TRAVIS: They're dark as night, man, of course they
do.

2080
01:58:43,189 --> 01:58:44,990
SAM: Are they daytime birds? They're daytime
birds. They're not owls.

2081
01:58:44,990 --> 01:58:46,153
TALIESIN: They're not owls.

2082
01:58:46,153 --> 01:58:47,046
SAM: Shit.

2083
01:58:47,046 --> 01:58:49,013
LAURA: Should've been a fucking owl.

2084
01:58:49,013 --> 01:58:50,700
TALIESIN: (owl sounds)

2085
01:58:50,700 --> 01:58:54,063
SAM: You can do that too? Quick, do a
nightingale.

2086
01:58:54,063 --> 01:58:58,314
MATT: No, you do not have darkvision as a--

2087
01:58:58,314 --> 01:59:00,765
SAM: So I'm just flying around in the dark
knocking into things.

2088
01:59:00,765 --> 01:59:08,868
MATT: Yeah. Essentially, you coast into the
shadow, hitting a couple things. You eventually

2089
01:59:08,868 --> 01:59:10,884
hit ceiling.

2090
01:59:10,884 --> 01:59:11,785
SAM: Ow!

2091
01:59:11,785 --> 01:59:19,077
MATT: And coast down and you land harshly, taking
three points of damage in your crow form as you

2092
01:59:19,077 --> 01:59:22,281
hit and land and tumble down a few stairs.

2093
01:59:22,281 --> 01:59:23,640
SAM: Ooh, stairs.

2094
01:59:23,640 --> 01:59:29,562
MATT: At that point, you're in complete darkness
right now, you can see a faint distant bit of

2095
01:59:29,562 --> 01:59:34,643
light that's barely creeping in from the entrance
you came from. Around you, though, nothing.

2096
01:59:34,643 --> 01:59:36,911
SAM: I'll break form and come back as Scanlan.

2097
01:59:36,911 --> 01:59:40,714
MATT: Okay. You come back as a gnome. Now your
darkvision kicks in and indeed you can see there

2098
01:59:40,714 --> 01:59:51,893
is a smoothly carved tunnel overhead that descends
down a long flight of stairs. Make a perception check.

2099
01:59:51,893 --> 01:59:56,010
SAM: Natural 18.

2100
01:59:56,010 --> 01:59:57,972
(laughter)

2101
01:59:57,972 --> 02:00:02,371
MATT: And you have 60-foot darkvision? As a
gnome?

2102
02:00:02,371 --> 02:00:06,281
SAM: It just says darkvision. I didn't write down
the distance.

2103
02:00:06,281 --> 02:00:10,239
MATT: Okay, I'm going to look this up real fast.
Because this is important to know for this

2104
02:00:10,239 --> 02:00:11,887
circumstance.

2105
02:00:11,887 --> 02:00:15,296
LIAM: By the way, blackbird has a hit point of
one, so technically you popped back into gnome

2106
02:00:15,296 --> 02:00:17,137
form the second you hit the ground.

2107
02:00:17,137 --> 02:00:18,496
MATT: Does it actually have one hit point?

2108
02:00:18,496 --> 02:00:19,345
LIAM: Yeah.

2109
02:00:19,345 --> 02:00:20,458
MATT: Then yeah.

2110
02:00:20,458 --> 02:00:21,915
MARISHA: Darkvision is 60 feet, I wrote it down.

2111
02:00:21,915 --> 02:00:23,768
SAM: 60 feet. I'll write it down for the future.

2112
02:00:23,830 --> 02:00:28,705
MATT: There you go. So yeah, your vision just hits
the edge of the staircase, which stops, and then

2113
02:00:28,705 --> 02:00:35,997
continues forward. The darkness beyond there is
obscured, or a hint of blue light that slightly

2114
02:00:36,087 --> 02:00:43,508
shifts and glimmers beyond your vision. It seems
like the tunnel ceiling ends as the path continues

2115
02:00:43,508 --> 02:00:48,182
beyond that, and your vision is cut off beyond
that. You cannot see, but you do see a very very

2116
02:00:48,182 --> 02:00:52,845
faint blue shimmer coming from the tunnel beyond.

2117
02:00:52,845 --> 02:00:56,379
LAURA: I float up to the edge of the mouth of the
cave and say, (whispers) Scanlan?

2118
02:00:56,379 --> 02:00:58,567
MATT: (echoes) Scanlan, Scanlan, Scanlan.

2119
02:00:58,567 --> 02:01:02,186
SAM: Wow, I've always wanted that to happen.

2120
02:01:02,186 --> 02:01:03,762
MATT: (echoes) Happen, happen--

2121
02:01:03,762 --> 02:01:10,493
LAURA: (whispers) Are you alive?

2122
02:01:10,493 --> 02:01:12,136
SAM: Can I see down the blue thing?

2123
02:01:12,136 --> 02:01:13,815
MATT: You can go down further if you want to.

2124
02:01:13,815 --> 02:01:17,930
SAM: I don't want to go to where the blue is, I
just want to see if I can peek down there?

2125
02:01:17,930 --> 02:01:20,620
MATT: You'd have to descend the stairs to. Because
the actual tunnel continues down along with the

2126
02:01:20,620 --> 02:01:23,425
roof and then as it continues past, it levels
off.

2127
02:01:23,425 --> 02:01:31,760
SAM: I'm going to die. I'm going to shoot one
single Magic Missile into the space.

2128
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:34,439
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

2129
02:01:34,439 --> 02:01:35,808
LAURA: What if that's his face?

2130
02:01:35,808 --> 02:01:40,397
MATT: All right, so you take the wand, and the
Magic Missile, which gives a very faint

2131
02:01:40,397 --> 02:01:44,900
candlelight glow around it as it is a burst of
arcane energy, arcs down and slams into the

2132
02:01:44,900 --> 02:01:49,407
stonework and filters out. The little flash you
see at the base of the stairway, the stonework

2133
02:01:49,407 --> 02:01:54,036
there is like a tiled square stonework, it looks
like the further you descend, the more and more

2134
02:01:54,036 --> 02:02:03,473
there is a constructed architecture to this place,
however, the missile dashes against the stone tile

2135
02:02:03,473 --> 02:02:08,536
floor at the bottom of the stairway. No other
seeming reaction, that same blue glimmer

2136
02:02:08,536 --> 02:02:09,828
unchanged.

2137
02:02:09,828 --> 02:02:19,857
SAM: Okay. I quickly pee a little on the side of
the wall, just a little bit, okay. Zip up, turn

2138
02:02:19,857 --> 02:02:24,641
into an owl and get outta there. At level five,
because I'm out of level four.

2139
02:02:24,641 --> 02:02:28,923
MATT: Okay, so. (hooting) An owl ascends quickly
and spooks you.

2140
02:02:28,923 --> 02:02:32,558
LAURA: I stay at the mouth of the cave and say,
(whispers) Scanlan, are you alive?

2141
02:02:32,558 --> 02:02:34,024
MATT: (echoing) Alive, alive, alive.

2142
02:02:34,024 --> 02:02:35,791
LAURA: (whispers) Scanlan?

2143
02:02:35,791 --> 02:02:38,754
MATT: (echoing) Scanlan, Scanlan.

2144
02:02:38,754 --> 02:02:44,289
LAURA: Wait. Scanlan! Is that you? You were a
crow.

2145
02:02:44,289 --> 02:02:47,089
SAM: (confused hooting)

2146
02:02:47,089 --> 02:02:51,021
LAURA: Okay. That's you. Should we go?

2147
02:02:51,021 --> 02:02:53,718
TALIESIN: You're just turning your head 180
degrees back and forth, aren't you?

2148
02:02:53,718 --> 02:02:54,862
SAM: Oh yeah.

2149
02:02:54,862 --> 02:02:57,943
LAURA: We should go back. One hoo for-- I start
flying back.

2150
02:02:57,943 --> 02:03:06,945
MATT: Vex takes off on the broom. All right. You
guys head back to the camp, make your way into the

2151
02:03:06,945 --> 02:03:11,582
mansion, and rest for the evening. You don't rest
for the evening?

2152
02:03:11,582 --> 02:03:12,609
TRAVIS: No.

2153
02:03:12,609 --> 02:03:13,670
SAM: What?

2154
02:03:13,670 --> 02:03:14,937
LAURA: You're exhausted.

2155
02:03:14,937 --> 02:03:17,122
TRAVIS: I have one level of exhaustion, I'm okay.

2156
02:03:17,122 --> 02:03:19,068
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend a little time
tinkering before I sleep, working on the broom.

2157
02:03:19,068 --> 02:03:19,764
MATT: Okay.

2158
02:03:19,764 --> 02:03:21,620
LIAM: I never stopped digging, can I assume that
everybody's buried?

2159
02:03:21,620 --> 02:03:23,544
MATT: At this point in time, yeah. By the time
they've been gone, everyone's been buried,

2160
02:03:23,544 --> 02:03:26,660
everyone's been taken care of, and you make your
way back, waiting at the door for your sister to return.

2161
02:03:26,660 --> 02:03:29,760
TRAVIS: What's the second level of exhaustion?

2162
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:35,364
MATT: Yeah, so yeah, for not taking your evening's
rest you get a second level of exhaustion and your

2163
02:03:35,364 --> 02:03:37,064
speed is halved.

2164
02:03:37,064 --> 02:03:39,700
TRAVIS: Okay. I want to see how far this can go. I
want to push this.

2165
02:03:39,700 --> 02:03:43,105
TALIESIN: I've tried this experiment in real life.
It never ends well.

2166
02:03:43,105 --> 02:03:44,575
(laughter)

2167
02:03:44,575 --> 02:03:47,770
TRAVIS: I'm willing to learn.

2168
02:03:47,770 --> 02:03:51,688
MATT: Okay. So we'll go ahead and take a break as
the party is resting for the evening, we'll be

2169
02:03:51,688 --> 02:03:56,090
back here in a few minutes, guys, to continue this
next chapter of Vox Machina's adventure. All

2170
02:03:56,090 --> 02:03:57,969
right, see you in a little bit.

2171
02:03:57,969 --> 02:17:50,793
[break]

2172
02:17:50,793 --> 02:17:57,766
MATT: Hey guys, welcome back. So. Kicking into
high gear to return to the game as it's going. You

2173
02:17:57,766 --> 02:18:03,017
guys go through your restful evening, except for
Grog, resting up and getting prepared for whatever

2174
02:18:03,017 --> 02:18:10,492
comes your way, except for Grog. As you spend the
night fending off sleep, staring at Craven Edge

2175
02:18:10,492 --> 02:18:16,761
there on your lap, feeling the cold blade against
your fingertips and considering and still feeling

2176
02:18:16,761 --> 02:18:19,437
the strength that it's imbued upon you pulsing
through your veins.

2177
02:18:19,437 --> 02:18:21,983
TRAVIS: Yeah, could I ask it one question?

2178
02:18:21,983 --> 02:18:23,496
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

2179
02:18:23,496 --> 02:18:25,926
TRAVIS: Right, it was a good day, right? Like,
superb.

2180
02:18:25,926 --> 02:18:27,680
MATT: "Yes."

2181
02:18:27,680 --> 02:18:29,792
TRAVIS: Do you remember your former owners?

2182
02:18:29,792 --> 02:18:31,266
MATT: "I do."

2183
02:18:31,266 --> 02:18:33,880
TRAVIS: Do you remember Lord Briarwood?

2184
02:18:33,880 --> 02:18:35,537
MATT: "I do."

2185
02:18:35,537 --> 02:18:37,379
TRAVIS: How was he?

2186
02:18:37,379 --> 02:18:45,464
MATT: "He was a stalwart champion. He kept me fed.
Mostly."

2187
02:18:45,464 --> 02:18:56,594
TRAVIS: Did he give you a goal? You know, before
we put him into different pieces, he was, like,

2188
02:18:56,594 --> 02:19:06,353
trying to build up this god called Vecna. You
don't know anything about a god called Vecna, do you?

2189
02:19:06,353 --> 02:19:09,283
MATT: "Doesn't interest me."

2190
02:19:09,283 --> 02:19:10,425
TRAVIS: No?

2191
02:19:10,425 --> 02:19:11,558
MATT: "No."

2192
02:19:11,558 --> 02:19:12,726
TRAVIS: Just the blood.

2193
02:19:12,726 --> 02:19:14,208
MATT: "Just the hunger."

2194
02:19:14,208 --> 02:19:15,418
TRAVIS: Right, the hunger.

2195
02:19:15,418 --> 02:19:17,323
MATT: "It's all there is, is the hunger."

2196
02:19:17,323 --> 02:19:23,954
TRAVIS: But look, we did really good today. So I'm
not going to go to sleep, I'm going to carry this

2197
02:19:23,954 --> 02:19:27,052
over the next day, I want to see how hard we can
push this.

2198
02:19:27,052 --> 02:19:28,952
MATT: "So close to being full."

2199
02:19:28,952 --> 02:19:44,070
TRAVIS: You're close to being full? Hold on, how
many more lives do you need?

2200
02:19:44,070 --> 02:19:47,243
MATT: "I'm close."

2201
02:19:47,243 --> 02:19:57,629
TRAVIS: Do you know, do you know what happens when
you get full? Like, do you get bigger? Do I get stronger?

2202
02:19:57,629 --> 02:20:00,394
MATT: "Feed me and you'll find out."

2203
02:20:00,394 --> 02:20:02,102
MARISHA: Oh boy.

2204
02:20:02,102 --> 02:20:06,600
TRAVIS: You've got it. Can I insight check the
sword?

2205
02:20:06,600 --> 02:20:07,606
MATT: Yeah.

2206
02:20:07,606 --> 02:20:09,070
LIAM: Yes please!

2207
02:20:09,070 --> 02:20:10,887
(laughter)

2208
02:20:10,887 --> 02:20:12,717
TALIESIN: I've never been so happy.

2209
02:20:12,717 --> 02:20:14,606
TRAVIS: (clears throat) Two.

2210
02:20:14,606 --> 02:20:17,434
(laughter)

2211
02:20:17,434 --> 02:20:23,231
MATT: It's hard to read the blade, but the
disposition doesn't seem to have changed any of

2212
02:20:23,231 --> 02:20:28,480
your previous conversations, so seems hard to
read. It's a sword.

2213
02:20:28,480 --> 02:20:35,334
TRAVIS: Outstanding. I tell you what, if you get
full, we'll celebrate this upcoming day

2214
02:20:35,334 --> 02:20:36,880
as your birthday.

2215
02:20:36,880 --> 02:20:41,525
MATT: "If you insist, Grog Strongjaw."

2216
02:20:41,525 --> 02:20:45,819
TRAVIS: And that'll do me for the night.

2217
02:20:45,819 --> 02:20:49,526
MATT: All right. You all come to, rallying your
breakfast, your chicken-filled breakfast.

2218
02:20:49,526 --> 02:20:52,240
LAURA: And some boar!

2219
02:20:52,240 --> 02:21:00,518
MATT: And some boar, freshly cooked by Grog, who
has some dark circles under the eyes from a night

2220
02:21:00,518 --> 02:21:03,273
of unrestful consciousness.

2221
02:21:03,273 --> 02:21:07,083
LAURA: How you doing there, Grog? And I slap him
across the face a few times.

2222
02:21:07,083 --> 02:21:08,189
TRAVIS: Really good.

2223
02:21:08,189 --> 02:21:09,024
LAURA: Yeah?

2224
02:21:09,024 --> 02:21:10,524
TRAVIS: Yeah, I slept really hard.

2225
02:21:10,524 --> 02:21:11,300
LAURA: That's good.

2226
02:21:11,300 --> 02:21:13,133
TRAVIS: Lots of dreams.

2227
02:21:13,133 --> 02:21:15,773
TALIESIN: All right. Let's send our friends on
their way and make our way to

2228
02:21:15,773 --> 02:21:17,295
the cavern that you found.

2229
02:21:17,295 --> 02:21:19,724
TRAVIS: Yeah, we send them back towards the camp
zone, right?

2230
02:21:19,724 --> 02:21:24,131
SAM: Yes, and they have a mapmaker with them, so
they'll find it without a problem.

2231
02:21:24,131 --> 02:21:25,709
LAURA: They'll know how to get back.

2232
02:21:25,709 --> 02:21:28,984
MATT: Tyriok's like, "Yes, I can actually find our
way back quite easily from this position, as we've

2233
02:21:28,984 --> 02:21:32,535
"already traveled this way and I have a good memory
for these types of things. I have to."

2234
02:21:32,535 --> 02:21:42,453
LAURA: Yes. Will you and Cyrus inform everyone
else that it's safe for them-- oh shit, we're not

2235
02:21:42,453 --> 02:21:47,008
back, they can't go there. We'll be back, and
we're going to send you to Whitestone, where

2236
02:21:47,008 --> 02:21:49,011
you'll be safe.

2237
02:21:49,011 --> 02:21:51,340
SAM: Eventually. But right now, just go to your--

2238
02:21:51,340 --> 02:21:55,143
TALIESIN: Well, they were fine rolling around, we
already sent the wounded and the young to

2239
02:21:55,143 --> 02:21:56,693
Whitestone, they're fine.

2240
02:21:56,693 --> 02:21:57,912
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2241
02:21:57,912 --> 02:22:03,754
MATT: "All right, then, that can be done, and can
I take my satchel with me in case I can find some

2242
02:22:03,754 --> 02:22:05,281
"way to recover it?"

2243
02:22:05,281 --> 02:22:07,066
LAURA: Of course, it's yours, darling.

2244
02:22:07,066 --> 02:22:13,384
MATT: "All right." And he takes the stone
arm-slash-satchel and tucks it under his arm. "All

2245
02:22:13,384 --> 02:22:19,912
"right. Rest of you." And Cyrus steps forward. "All
right, well, lead the way." And they all give you

2246
02:22:19,912 --> 02:22:28,160
guys a thank-you, the little girl runs up,
Vanessa, and hugs you and hugs Keyleth, and Cyrus

2247
02:22:28,160 --> 02:22:33,104
and them pull a couple of the orcish weapons that
were left behind and arm themselves. Cyrus

2248
02:22:33,104 --> 02:22:37,926
actually takes a couple of javelins and is like,
(sighs) "I think the proper way to make vengeance

2249
02:22:37,926 --> 02:22:40,942
"with these. All right, you guys stay safe."

2250
02:22:40,942 --> 02:22:42,187
LAURA: You too.

2251
02:22:42,187 --> 02:22:43,877
MATT: "Really appreciate it."

2252
02:22:43,877 --> 02:22:44,804
LIAM: Tyriok!

2253
02:22:44,804 --> 02:22:46,130
MATT: "Yes?"

2254
02:22:46,130 --> 02:22:48,068
LIAM: Could I have my loaner back, please?

2255
02:22:48,068 --> 02:22:52,026
MATT: (laughs) "Oh, right, right, yeah,
certainly." He pulls it out and hands it to you.

2256
02:22:52,026 --> 02:22:55,850
LIAM: I'll take that carefully. Thank you.

2257
02:22:55,850 --> 02:22:58,511
LAURA: You can keep the opal dagger I gave you.

2258
02:22:58,511 --> 02:23:01,448
MATT: "Oh, thank you thank you thank you so
much!"

2259
02:23:01,448 --> 02:23:03,273
TRAVIS: (under his breath) Infertility.

2260
02:23:03,273 --> 02:23:09,197
MATT: Puts it back away. "I appreciate that. All
right, so we'll be off?" The rest of the people

2261
02:23:09,197 --> 02:23:13,188
nod, they take some of the supplies from the
wagons, they begin making their way back on the

2262
02:23:13,188 --> 02:23:17,117
already treaded path you guys made that Tyriok
knows is safe to get out of the Frostweald.

2263
02:23:17,117 --> 02:23:19,424
LAURA: Scanlan, did you see how generous I was
just then?

2264
02:23:19,424 --> 02:23:20,803
SAM: Nope, missed it.

2265
02:23:20,803 --> 02:23:24,996
LAURA: What's wrong, Grog?

2266
02:23:24,996 --> 02:23:26,410
TRAVIS: What?

2267
02:23:26,410 --> 02:23:28,162
SAM: Did you have trouble sleeping?

2268
02:23:28,162 --> 02:23:33,827
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, look, the sand pit was, I think
I need to comb it after you use it.

2269
02:23:33,827 --> 02:23:35,791
SAM: Sand pit? I have a bedroom for you.

2270
02:23:35,791 --> 02:23:39,775
TRAVIS: What? There's a training area downstairs
just for me.

2271
02:23:39,775 --> 02:23:43,967
SAM: Oh Grog, you have your own bedroom upstairs.
It's got a giant-sized bed in it.

2272
02:23:43,967 --> 02:23:45,191
TRAVIS: I haven't been using it.

2273
02:23:45,191 --> 02:23:50,719
SAM: Oh, for crying-- I spent minutes thinking
about conjuring that.

2274
02:23:50,719 --> 02:23:53,909
MARISHA: Grog, you did sleep last night, right?

2275
02:23:53,909 --> 02:23:59,990
TRAVIS: Yep. Yeah, I mean, like, I had my way with
a few of those imaginary friends, because, man.

2276
02:23:59,990 --> 02:24:07,287
No. It was good. Good sleep. Real, a little sore
in my back.

2277
02:24:07,287 --> 02:24:09,735
LIAM: I'm going to make an insight check on Grog.

2278
02:24:09,735 --> 02:24:11,794
MATT: Insight check, go for it.

2279
02:24:11,794 --> 02:24:16,334
LIAM: Yeah. 16.

2280
02:24:16,334 --> 02:24:17,645
MATT: Okay.

2281
02:24:17,645 --> 02:24:21,425
SAM: Whispers!

2282
02:24:21,425 --> 02:24:23,373
LAURA: Whispers about Grog?

2283
02:24:23,373 --> 02:24:25,164
LIAM: I've never had a whisper before!

2284
02:24:25,164 --> 02:24:26,511
LAURA: You've never had a whisper?

2285
02:24:26,511 --> 02:24:28,268
LIAM: On the show.

2286
02:24:28,268 --> 02:24:30,480
TALIESIN: It's warm in your ear.

2287
02:24:30,480 --> 02:24:35,595
SAM: I don't know what products we're selling
currently, but I assume there are some.

2288
02:24:35,595 --> 02:24:38,928
TALIESIN: We do know that Gilmore's Glorious Goods
shirts will be shipping out next week.

2289
02:24:38,928 --> 02:24:41,132
SAM: Oh wow! The preorder shirts?

2290
02:24:41,132 --> 02:24:43,911
TALIESIN: Gilmore's Glorious Goods shirt, the
preorder shirt will be shipping out next week.

2291
02:24:43,911 --> 02:24:47,356
We'll be using this time to ignore what's
happening over here while the Gilmore's Glorious

2292
02:24:47,356 --> 02:24:49,796
Goods shirts ship out next week.

2293
02:24:49,796 --> 02:24:52,353
MARISHA: And of course don't forget to tune in
next week for our 50th episode.

2294
02:24:52,353 --> 02:24:55,648
TALIESIN: 50th episode. Not anniversary.

2295
02:24:55,648 --> 02:24:58,847
SAM: 50th episode. There's going to be special
giveaways. I don't know. Is that true? I don't know.

2296
02:24:58,847 --> 02:25:00,556
LAURA: What, no, there's not.

2297
02:25:00,556 --> 02:25:07,091
MATT: So. What do you want to do?

2298
02:25:07,091 --> 02:25:10,513
MARISHA: Shall we? Up the mountain!

2299
02:25:10,513 --> 02:25:15,246
LAURA: Wait. So did we already tell everyone what
we saw?

2300
02:25:15,246 --> 02:25:16,893
MARISHA: I'm assuming you told us when you got
back.

2301
02:25:16,893 --> 02:25:18,122
LAURA: Yeah.

2302
02:25:18,122 --> 02:25:19,635
MATT: You guys informed the party of what you
saw.

2303
02:25:19,635 --> 02:25:21,890
SAM: There's a triangle, seems to be Ioun-based.

2304
02:25:21,890 --> 02:25:23,559
LAURA: Blue light.

2305
02:25:23,559 --> 02:25:28,420
SAM: Smells of urine inside, it's very weird.

2306
02:25:28,420 --> 02:25:35,962
LIAM: Scanlan, maybe not black birds for a while.
All right? It's a touchy subject.

2307
02:25:35,962 --> 02:25:41,763
SAM: Ooh, sorry. I forgot. Well actually, no, I
don't know what you're talking about.

2308
02:25:41,763 --> 02:25:47,927
LIAM: Stay away from black birds for a while.

2309
02:25:47,927 --> 02:25:49,237
SAM: Okay.

2310
02:25:49,237 --> 02:25:50,536
LIAM: Thanks, buddy.

2311
02:25:50,536 --> 02:25:52,003
SAM: Sure, no problem.

2312
02:25:52,003 --> 02:25:56,371
MATT: All right. You guys make your way southward
to the Frostweald.

2313
02:25:56,371 --> 02:25:58,385
SAM: The Frostweald.

2314
02:25:58,385 --> 02:26:00,605
MATT: Frostweald? Frostwold?

2315
02:26:00,605 --> 02:26:04,896
TALIESIN: Frost-vield. What is wrong
with-- Frost-vield.

2316
02:26:04,896 --> 02:26:09,516
MARISHA: Frost-Willem Dafoe.

2317
02:26:09,516 --> 02:26:10,785
SAM: Sig-il.

2318
02:26:10,785 --> 02:26:13,050
MATT: I will smite you.

2319
02:26:13,050 --> 02:26:14,192
MARISHA: Jif.

2320
02:26:14,192 --> 02:26:16,151
TALIESIN: Jif. God damn it, you beat me to it.

2321
02:26:16,151 --> 02:26:19,960
MATT: All right. You guys continue to head south,
eventually following the path that you lead along

2322
02:26:19,960 --> 02:26:21,725
with Keyleth's directional--

2323
02:26:21,725 --> 02:26:25,300
LAURA: I keep an eye out for any enemies along the
way.

2324
02:26:25,300 --> 02:26:30,544
MATT: Indeed you do, make a perception check,
being the scout person for this.

2325
02:26:30,544 --> 02:26:32,480
LAURA: I'm going to do that with advantage because
I'm in the woods.

2326
02:26:32,480 --> 02:26:35,101
MATT: You're in the forest, yeah, that is true.

2327
02:26:35,101 --> 02:26:37,086
LAURA: 25.

2328
02:26:37,086 --> 02:26:42,665
MATT: 25. With that, you manage to skirt the
outside of what appears to be another localized

2329
02:26:42,665 --> 02:26:50,190
basilisk nest. You catch it early enough and guide
the party around it to avoid that on your way.

2330
02:26:50,190 --> 02:26:52,921
LAURA: Let's go this way and then circle back.

2331
02:26:52,921 --> 02:26:58,249
MATT: You eventually make your way to the
outskirts of the forest, the trees begin to thin

2332
02:26:58,249 --> 02:27:04,011
out, the snow begins to melt, the temperature
begins to rise somewhat. It's still cold-ish, but

2333
02:27:04,011 --> 02:27:05,387
it's less freezing.

2334
02:27:05,387 --> 02:27:09,816
TRAVIS: Oh right, the <i>Frost</i>-weald.

2335
02:27:09,816 --> 02:27:16,336
MATT: Yeah, there's been a long-term enchantment
over this forest that has kept it the way it is,

2336
02:27:16,336 --> 02:27:24,677
you're not certain as to what the actual reasons
are for it. Eventually, as the sun reaches not

2337
02:27:24,677 --> 02:27:31,803
quite zenith but later morning, you find your way
to the outside of this tunnel that you and Scanlan

2338
02:27:31,803 --> 02:27:36,927
had found the evening before. There before you,
you guys see the 30-foot-tall triangular entrance

2339
02:27:36,927 --> 02:27:41,886
to this passageway deeper into the mountain
itself.

2340
02:27:41,886 --> 02:27:50,875
LAURA: So this is the place. Technically, Scanlan
flew in, so I don't think he had to check for traps.

2341
02:27:50,875 --> 02:27:56,290
SAM: I did not check for traps, I just flew in,
but perhaps we should this time.

2342
02:27:56,290 --> 02:27:58,574
LIAM: Lead me in as far as you went.

2343
02:27:58,574 --> 02:28:00,425
SAM: If you'll check for traps.

2344
02:28:00,425 --> 02:28:03,153
LIAM: Yeah. Where you flew over, yeah.

2345
02:28:03,153 --> 02:28:04,785
SAM: Yes, let's do it.

2346
02:28:04,785 --> 02:28:06,954
LIAM: In the entrance and down those stairs.

2347
02:28:06,954 --> 02:28:12,141
MATT: All right. So go ahead and make an
investigation check.

2348
02:28:12,141 --> 02:28:21,045
LIAM: 20. No, 17.

2349
02:28:21,045 --> 02:28:23,301
MATT: 17.

2350
02:28:23,301 --> 02:28:25,670
SAM: I will also check for traps.

2351
02:28:25,670 --> 02:28:27,500
MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.

2352
02:28:27,500 --> 02:28:29,152
SAM: 22.

2353
02:28:29,152 --> 02:28:33,640
LIAM: Checking for traps, I should know this, but
is that separate from perception for me?

2354
02:28:33,640 --> 02:28:38,777
MATT: Perception is to notice various details in
here, if you're actually actively searching for

2355
02:28:38,777 --> 02:28:45,436
trap mechanisms like that, investigation is
generally more used. Yeah.

2356
02:28:45,436 --> 02:28:49,417
SAM: 22.

2357
02:28:49,417 --> 02:28:52,314
MATT: I mean, they're both pretty similar in some
ways and it depends on the circumstances.

2358
02:28:52,314 --> 02:28:58,449
LIAM: But is it a different roll? Traps? Or is it
just perception and investigation?

2359
02:28:58,449 --> 02:29:02,375
MATT: Perception and investigation, depending on
the circumstance, one or the other. For the most

2360
02:29:02,375 --> 02:29:05,055
part, perception would be like if you notice
something wrong about the room, you'd be like,

2361
02:29:05,055 --> 02:29:09,340
that stone seems different, then you would do
investigation to try to find out what type of trap

2362
02:29:09,340 --> 02:29:15,706
it is per se, or if you were actively searching
for traps, that would be more of an investigation,

2363
02:29:15,706 --> 02:29:22,322
like knowing where you've seen around, and seeing
the terrain to possibly facilitate something like that.

2364
02:29:22,322 --> 02:29:24,280
LIAM: It's only my third year doing this.

2365
02:29:24,280 --> 02:29:26,109
MATT: I know, it's all good. What did you have
again?

2366
02:29:26,109 --> 02:29:27,428
SAM: 22.

2367
02:29:27,428 --> 02:29:32,587
MATT: 22. All right. As you guys slowly descend
the steps, as you get about 25, 30 feet into the

2368
02:29:32,587 --> 02:29:38,262
tunnel before it lowers into these stone steps,
and they're rather large steps. Each spread of

2369
02:29:38,262 --> 02:29:42,795
your gait is wider than the common step, and these
have been around for a very long time. You can see

2370
02:29:42,795 --> 02:29:47,685
where the corners are, they're rounded. Looks like
at points in time there may have been flooding in

2371
02:29:47,685 --> 02:29:56,377
this area that has caused that type of softening
of the stonework at the tip, though the little bit

2372
02:29:56,377 --> 02:30:02,177
of moisture that's in this area seems to be from
blown-in snow possibly or another source you don't

2373
02:30:02,177 --> 02:30:08,179
currently see. It is pitch-dark in here, if anyone
would like to--

2374
02:30:08,179 --> 02:30:10,103
TRAVIS: I have darkvision.

2375
02:30:10,103 --> 02:30:14,907
MATT: He has darkvision. Darkvision, darkvision.
Darkvision, darkvision. Absolutely blind.

2376
02:30:14,907 --> 02:30:17,536
LIAM: I'm pulling out Flametongue dagger.

2377
02:30:17,536 --> 02:30:22,026
MARISHA: Then I'll light up my hands a little
bit.

2378
02:30:22,026 --> 02:30:25,299
MATT: Okay, so you guys have a low candlelight, so
it gives you a little bit of vision, but it's

2379
02:30:25,299 --> 02:30:30,795
still very, very dim. You guys make your way down
the stairway, step to step, and you can hear each

2380
02:30:30,795 --> 02:30:40,521
footstep echoes as you continue downward. It
progresses deeper and deeper and you begin to see

2381
02:30:40,521 --> 02:30:45,454
this gentle blue flickering light at the very
bottom of the staircase as it begins to approach,

2382
02:30:45,454 --> 02:30:47,940
and your eyes have adjusted to the darkness at
this point in time.

2383
02:30:47,940 --> 02:30:52,140
LAURA: Does it look like water reflection?

2384
02:30:52,140 --> 02:30:59,447
MATT: It looks like it could be some sort of
water-like movement, and as you hit the bottom of

2385
02:30:59,447 --> 02:31:05,169
the stairway and it evens out into these square
stone tiles across the way, you see ahead of you

2386
02:31:05,169 --> 02:31:13,839
what looks to be a singular circular room with no
exits from what you can tell at this point. Just a

2387
02:31:13,839 --> 02:31:22,075
circular room that loops around, and in the center
there is a ten-foot pool of a still, somewhat

2388
02:31:22,075 --> 02:31:30,396
still surface of water. There is a little bit of
movement because there is some sort of a cold

2389
02:31:30,396 --> 02:31:34,787
breeze that was ejecting out of the tunnel, but
there is no real source of the wind that you can

2390
02:31:34,787 --> 02:31:37,409
pick up at the moment.

2391
02:31:37,409 --> 02:31:43,576
LAURA: Can I investigate the walls? Did you
already check for traps in this room?

2392
02:31:43,576 --> 02:31:47,005
LIAM: I did an investigation check.

2393
02:31:47,005 --> 02:31:49,311
MATT: As you entered this room?

2394
02:31:49,311 --> 02:31:50,941
LIAM: Yeah, I'll do it again here.

2395
02:31:50,941 --> 02:31:53,675
MATT: That was when you guys were going down the
stairway, go ahead and make the roll.

2396
02:31:53,675 --> 02:31:56,270
LIAM: I'm going to use Luck.

2397
02:31:56,270 --> 02:31:57,688
SAM: I got a 24.

2398
02:31:57,688 --> 02:31:58,778
MATT: 24, okay.

2399
02:31:58,778 --> 02:32:00,325
LIAM: 18.

2400
02:32:00,325 --> 02:32:07,308
MATT: 18, okay. The two of you, there is a very,
very faint blue glow that is emanating from below

2401
02:32:07,308 --> 02:32:13,893
the surface of the water that is giving this very,
very tiny bit of light to the room. Thankfully

2402
02:32:13,893 --> 02:32:20,491
because most of you are darkvision-based, it
doesn't impede you from seeing all the details in

2403
02:32:20,491 --> 02:32:24,296
the room. Percy, you'll still not be able to make
out the fine details.

2404
02:32:24,296 --> 02:32:25,926
TALIESIN: That's why I'm in the back.

2405
02:32:25,926 --> 02:32:32,451
MATT: But between the two of you inspecting the
edges, there are no seams, there are no doors,

2406
02:32:32,451 --> 02:32:39,155
there are no other passages. You do, however, see
script across the opposite side of the room that

2407
02:32:39,155 --> 02:32:43,803
is chiseled into the stonework itself in Elvish
script.

2408
02:32:43,803 --> 02:32:45,268
MARISHA: Oh, Elvish.

2409
02:32:45,268 --> 02:32:49,028
MATT: Oh sorry, this is not Elvish, Elvish was the
obelisk. What languages do you--

2410
02:32:49,028 --> 02:32:52,498
LIAM: Common, Elvish, and Abyssal.

2411
02:32:52,498 --> 02:32:53,778
MATT: What languages do you know?

2412
02:32:53,778 --> 02:32:55,431
SAM: Gnome and Common.

2413
02:32:55,431 --> 02:32:57,409
MATT: It is a language neither of you know.

2414
02:32:57,409 --> 02:32:59,036
TALIESIN: Can I take a look at it?

2415
02:32:59,036 --> 02:33:00,369
SAM: You can't see nothing.

2416
02:33:00,369 --> 02:33:02,671
LIAM: I walk up with my dagger and hold it
underneath.

2417
02:33:02,671 --> 02:33:04,401
MATT: Run it across?

2418
02:33:04,401 --> 02:33:05,753
TALIESIN: Celestial?

2419
02:33:05,753 --> 02:33:07,508
MATT: It is Celestial.

2420
02:33:07,508 --> 02:33:08,694
TALIESIN: Well, there you go.

2421
02:33:08,694 --> 02:33:10,220
MATT: Are you the only one that knows Celestial?

2422
02:33:10,220 --> 02:33:16,696
TALIESIN: I had not a lot of friends growing up,
this was a lot of quiet time.

2423
02:33:16,696 --> 02:33:23,736
MATT: (laughs) That is okay. All right, so.
Looking at this, it reads, and you read it out

2424
02:33:23,736 --> 02:33:29,264
loud, the translation. The thing about Celestial,
it's interesting, it's a beautiful-sounding

2425
02:33:29,264 --> 02:33:38,305
language that even the translation to Common is
built into rhyme. It says, "Knowledge dost billow,

2426
02:33:38,305 --> 02:33:46,096
"all realms are the shore. The sky a window, the
water a door."

2427
02:33:46,096 --> 02:33:49,002
MARISHA: Wait.

2428
02:33:49,002 --> 02:33:52,248
LAURA: Wait. Start at the beginning?

2429
02:33:52,248 --> 02:34:00,652
MATT: "Knowledge dost billow, all realms are the
shore. The sky a window, the water a door."

2430
02:34:00,652 --> 02:34:07,369
TRAVIS: Yep. So in this room, it's a circle,
what's the distance across the room?

2431
02:34:07,369 --> 02:34:09,998
MATT: It's about 30 feet across on a side.

2432
02:34:09,998 --> 02:34:11,479
TRAVIS: Oh, so it's not that big.

2433
02:34:11,479 --> 02:34:13,201
MATT: And it's a ten-foot pool. No, it's a pretty
tight space.

2434
02:34:13,201 --> 02:34:16,039
TRAVIS: And there's solid flooring and then the
pool in the middle.

2435
02:34:16,039 --> 02:34:18,811
MATT: Yeah, in the middle, so you move around. So
a ten-foot walkway around it.

2436
02:34:18,811 --> 02:34:25,908
LAURA: Can I get on the broom? And fly up above
the pool of water and look down into it?

2437
02:34:25,908 --> 02:34:31,593
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a perception check.

2438
02:34:31,593 --> 02:34:33,977
LAURA: 25.

2439
02:34:33,977 --> 02:34:40,665
MATT: 25. Looking down into it, you see no bottom.
You see the glow continues downward and it's

2440
02:34:40,665 --> 02:34:47,975
almost like there is a very soft, faint source of
light in there, but the water obscures it too much

2441
02:34:47,975 --> 02:34:54,571
to see a bottom. It doesn't disappear into
darkness, which leads you to believe that it's not

2442
02:34:54,571 --> 02:34:59,013
endless, but you can't make out any details of
where it would end or how far that is from where

2443
02:34:59,013 --> 02:35:05,627
you are. You do see what looks to be slow,
shifting movement of aquatic plant life that is

2444
02:35:05,627 --> 02:35:09,137
gathered on the edges about ten feet down and
further.

2445
02:35:09,137 --> 02:35:11,817
MARISHA: So Percy read this out loud, right?

2446
02:35:11,817 --> 02:35:13,571
TALIESIN: Yes, I read it out loud.

2447
02:35:13,571 --> 02:35:21,579
MARISHA: Would Keyleth know anything about this as
possibly being a portal to the realm of water? Can

2448
02:35:21,579 --> 02:35:25,377
I do like a check to see if this is something that
might be a--

2449
02:35:25,377 --> 02:35:27,155
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

2450
02:35:27,155 --> 02:35:28,947
MARISHA: Not my strong suit.

2451
02:35:28,947 --> 02:35:30,561
TALIESIN: Good, oh!

2452
02:35:30,561 --> 02:35:34,732
LAURA: Oh my gosh Keyleth, you're so smart!

2453
02:35:34,732 --> 02:35:37,502
MARISHA: I'm so smart. Just straight
intelligence?

2454
02:35:37,502 --> 02:35:38,909
MATT: Straight intelligence.

2455
02:35:38,909 --> 02:35:39,964
MARISHA: 15.

2456
02:35:39,964 --> 02:35:49,585
MATT: 15. There is talk of elements here, very
plainly in the translation. It's possible.

2457
02:35:49,585 --> 02:35:57,319
However, usually doorways to the planes have a
very prominent magical signature to them, one that

2458
02:35:57,319 --> 02:36:03,738
is especially, you are pretty sensitive to, being
an Ashari, and that is a large part of what your

2459
02:36:03,738 --> 02:36:12,894
people's charge is. You do not get the feeling
that this pool is a gateway to another plane, per

2460
02:36:12,894 --> 02:36:15,122
se, just a very deep pool.

2461
02:36:15,122 --> 02:36:18,846
LAURA: Keyleth! Use the thing to see magical
runes!

2462
02:36:18,846 --> 02:36:20,932
SAM: Oh yeah, yeah. The chunk, the hunk.

2463
02:36:20,932 --> 02:36:24,976
MARISHA: Okay, I pull out my Hunk of Quall. Hunk
of Quall.

2464
02:36:24,976 --> 02:36:33,062
MATT: Hold it up and concentrate for a moment.
Doesn't seem to spark, and there doesn't appear to

2465
02:36:33,062 --> 02:36:34,177
be a reaction.

2466
02:36:34,177 --> 02:36:36,127
LAURA: Really thought it was going to do
something, I really, really did.

2467
02:36:36,127 --> 02:36:41,057
TRAVIS: Can I take a single gold coin, make a
wish, and flick it into the wishing well.

2468
02:36:41,057 --> 02:36:43,966
LAURA: I watch it go down.

2469
02:36:43,966 --> 02:36:53,551
MATT: Drifts from side to side, drifts down,
glimmers occasionally, drifts, and then is out of sight.

2470
02:36:53,551 --> 02:37:00,675
LIAM: There's a fairly good chance we need to go
down through this. Grog and Keyleth? You're

2471
02:37:00,675 --> 02:37:05,302
probably the best suited for this, you because
your fucking chest is so big and you because you

2472
02:37:05,302 --> 02:37:07,121
can turn into water.

2473
02:37:07,121 --> 02:37:10,826
TRAVIS: I also have two vials of breathing
underwater.

2474
02:37:10,826 --> 02:37:12,774
LAURA: Hey, that's a good thing.

2475
02:37:12,774 --> 02:37:16,747
MARISHA: I also happened to pack Control Water in
my bag of tricks today.

2476
02:37:16,747 --> 02:37:19,415
TRAVIS: You did?

2477
02:37:19,415 --> 02:37:20,760
MARISHA: I did.

2478
02:37:20,760 --> 02:37:22,049
TRAVIS: Fricking awesome.

2479
02:37:22,049 --> 02:37:25,171
MARISHA: When we go underground there tends to be
water, so I tend to bring it.

2480
02:37:25,171 --> 02:37:27,684
LAURA: Should we control it, or--

2481
02:37:27,684 --> 02:37:32,756
MARISHA: Keyleth walks up and puts her hands in
the pool.

2482
02:37:32,756 --> 02:37:34,507
MATT: Okay.

2483
02:37:34,507 --> 02:37:38,076
MARISHA: Anything happen when I touch the water?

2484
02:37:38,076 --> 02:37:42,812
MATT: Your hand goes in the water. It is cold, it
is in line with most subterranean pools that

2485
02:37:42,812 --> 02:37:49,760
you've encountered. Not freezing, but very chilly.
Reacts like any other water that you've

2486
02:37:49,760 --> 02:37:53,129
encountered before. It's not particularly murky,
either.

2487
02:37:53,129 --> 02:37:54,700
MARISHA: I dive in.

2488
02:37:54,700 --> 02:37:59,048
MATT: Keyleth, (splash). You dive in, pulling
yourself down.

2489
02:37:59,048 --> 02:38:00,797
LIAM: Grog. Go with her.

2490
02:38:00,797 --> 02:38:02,171
TRAVIS: You got it.

2491
02:38:02,171 --> 02:38:06,306
MATT: Sinking down, and you can see the tunnel
around you, it goes from smoother stone to a

2492
02:38:06,306 --> 02:38:15,175
little rougher and as you descend you can see the
algae and various aquatic plant matter and life

2493
02:38:15,175 --> 02:38:19,734
that is gathered around, until eventually you go
down about 40 feet or so, your feet hit the

2494
02:38:19,734 --> 02:38:24,775
bottom, and you can see it ends behind you but
then before you there is a tunnel, there is a

2495
02:38:24,775 --> 02:38:27,784
continued walkway underwater forward.

2496
02:38:27,784 --> 02:38:30,445
TRAVIS: I come down behind her.

2497
02:38:30,445 --> 02:38:37,776
MATT: You feel the impact as Grog lands right
behind you. Let me see here. What's your

2498
02:38:37,776 --> 02:38:46,555
constitution modifier? Keyleth?

2499
02:38:46,555 --> 02:38:52,511
MARISHA: Not great. Two. Plus two.

2500
02:38:52,511 --> 02:38:56,567
MATT: Two? Okay. Yours is five, right? For the
constitution modifier?

2501
02:38:56,567 --> 02:38:59,357
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry, no, I'm being a dickhole. It is
five, yeah.

2502
02:38:59,357 --> 02:39:01,038
MATT: Yeah, so you can hold your breath for five
minutes.

2503
02:39:01,038 --> 02:39:02,502
SAM: Five minutes!

2504
02:39:02,502 --> 02:39:04,298
MARISHA: Is that however long your--

2505
02:39:04,298 --> 02:39:06,363
MATT: Yeah, one minute per constitution modifier.
For you it's two.

2506
02:39:06,363 --> 02:39:07,546
MARISHA: Interesting.

2507
02:39:07,546 --> 02:39:10,921
MATT: After you've landed here, you're about 30
seconds in, looking around, Grog's there.

2508
02:39:10,921 --> 02:39:16,039
MARISHA: How far does the tunnel look?

2509
02:39:16,039 --> 02:39:19,138
MATT: Make a perception check, with disadvantage
because of the water distortion.

2510
02:39:19,138 --> 02:39:22,357
TRAVIS: Can I look everywhere except the tunnel
with my darkvision?

2511
02:39:22,357 --> 02:39:25,838
MARISHA: Bad and bad. 16.

2512
02:39:25,838 --> 02:39:27,768
MATT: With disadvantage.

2513
02:39:27,768 --> 02:39:29,090
MARISHA: 16.

2514
02:39:29,090 --> 02:39:31,148
TRAVIS: Don't worry about it, it's four.

2515
02:39:31,148 --> 02:39:41,335
MATT: (laughs) It's not hard to see. The tunnel
continues, begins to curve upward about 60 to 80

2516
02:39:41,335 --> 02:39:48,165
feet ahead of you. It is choked with that heavy
algae slowly drifting there, but there is a path

2517
02:39:48,165 --> 02:39:51,994
you can see to swim through where it wouldn't
really stop or halt your progress.

2518
02:39:51,994 --> 02:39:53,670
But it curves upward.

2519
02:39:53,670 --> 02:39:56,766
MARISHA: You want to keep going?

2520
02:39:56,766 --> 02:40:00,465
MARISHA and TRAVIS: (underwater blubbing
conversation sounds)

2521
02:40:00,465 --> 02:40:02,953
MATT: You're halfway through your breath, by the
way. You're now at one minute.

2522
02:40:02,953 --> 02:40:13,959
TRAVIS: I'll swim forward. Just to where it starts
to curve up.

2523
02:40:13,959 --> 02:40:17,413
MATT: I'll have both you guys make athletics
checks.

2524
02:40:17,413 --> 02:40:20,514
TRAVIS: That sucks dick.

2525
02:40:20,514 --> 02:40:22,169
LAURA: At disadvantage.

2526
02:40:22,169 --> 02:40:23,661
TRAVIS: At a disadvantage?

2527
02:40:23,661 --> 02:40:25,174
MATT: No, not athletics.

2528
02:40:25,174 --> 02:40:26,117
MARISHA: 15.

2529
02:40:26,117 --> 02:40:27,262
TRAVIS: 12.

2530
02:40:27,262 --> 02:40:29,344
MATT: Oh, no, you do, because you have
exhaustion.

2531
02:40:29,344 --> 02:40:30,973
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right. 12.

2532
02:40:30,973 --> 02:40:32,185
MATT: 12. What?

2533
02:40:32,185 --> 02:40:33,229
MARISHA: 15.

2534
02:40:33,229 --> 02:40:35,939
MATT: 15. Okay. You guys aren't having a huge
issue, you get forward, you can move about half

2535
02:40:35,939 --> 02:40:40,555
your movement forward every six seconds or so, so
you manage to make your way up into the center of

2536
02:40:40,555 --> 02:40:48,147
where the plant matter begins to grow darker and
more apparent. Grog, you start making your way

2537
02:40:48,147 --> 02:40:53,907
through. I need you to go ahead and make a
dexterity save at disadvantage.

2538
02:40:53,907 --> 02:40:56,765
MARISHA: What? What the why? What the why?

2539
02:40:56,765 --> 02:40:58,414
SAM: Piranhas, that's why.

2540
02:40:58,414 --> 02:41:01,862
MATT: Dexterity at disadvantage because you're
swimming underwater, in which movement is much

2541
02:41:01,862 --> 02:41:03,248
harder as well.

2542
02:41:03,248 --> 02:41:04,540
LIAM: Ninja sharks.

2543
02:41:04,540 --> 02:41:05,408
TRAVIS: 11.

2544
02:41:05,408 --> 02:41:06,502
MATT: 11. All right.

2545
02:41:06,502 --> 02:41:08,084
MARISHA: Dolphins with lasers.

2546
02:41:08,084 --> 02:41:09,179
LAURA: It's going to be so bad.

2547
02:41:09,179 --> 02:41:15,615
MATT: You take eight points of psychic damage as
suddenly, out of the greenish plant matter, you

2548
02:41:15,615 --> 02:41:23,106
see these red tendrils, these red vines of algae
that begin reaching out towards you. One of them

2549
02:41:23,106 --> 02:41:28,517
brushes against your shoulder, and you feel this
surge of shock energy almost travel through your

2550
02:41:28,517 --> 02:41:32,321
nervous system to your head, and it's like you
have an instantly pounding headache and you feel

2551
02:41:32,321 --> 02:41:35,778
your muscles begin to tense up. Make a
constitution saving throw.

2552
02:41:35,778 --> 02:41:37,278
LAURA: Oh god!

2553
02:41:37,278 --> 02:41:38,964
TRAVIS: That's a one.

2554
02:41:38,964 --> 02:41:40,583
(gasping)

2555
02:41:40,583 --> 02:41:46,031
MATT: You feel your muscles lock up as paralysis
takes over. You watch as Grog suddenly tenses up,

2556
02:41:46,031 --> 02:41:49,223
and the air that's in his lungs escapes in a big
heave.

2557
02:41:49,223 --> 02:41:54,513
MARISHA: Upon seeing this, I reach forward and I
grab hold of him and I cast Control Water and

2558
02:41:54,513 --> 02:41:56,761
jettison the both of us out of there.

2559
02:41:56,761 --> 02:42:02,712
TRAVIS: If it's water.

2560
02:42:02,712 --> 02:42:05,432
LAURA: It's got to be water.

2561
02:42:05,432 --> 02:42:07,443
MARISHA: I kicked the camera, sorry.

2562
02:42:07,443 --> 02:42:10,306
MATT: So do you, you push yourself away, you jet?
Okay.

2563
02:42:10,306 --> 02:42:12,949
MARISHA: I take a jet, jetting us back out.
Waterslide!

2564
02:42:12,949 --> 02:42:17,659
MATT: So you pull him back using Control Water to
shove you guys. Yeah, the water's basically

2565
02:42:17,659 --> 02:42:25,350
pushing you forward, like an ice man waterslide,
and make your way to the other side. Grog, you,

2566
02:42:25,350 --> 02:42:30,520
that's the first round to get you to the bottom
there, your constitution modifier's five, you have

2567
02:42:30,520 --> 02:42:32,395
five rounds before you're officially drowning.

2568
02:42:32,395 --> 02:42:33,637
TRAVIS: Okay.

2569
02:42:33,637 --> 02:42:39,087
MATT: So she pulls you in, grabs you to the
bottom. You look up. Using Control Water again to

2570
02:42:39,087 --> 02:42:41,934
concentrate, this is going to take you two rounds
to get to the top because you're

2571
02:42:41,934 --> 02:42:43,169
carrying Grog's weight.

2572
02:42:43,169 --> 02:42:44,520
LAURA: Can I see them coming up?

2573
02:42:44,520 --> 02:42:48,717
MATT: You do see the form begin, Keyleth's face
begin rising to the surface. Eventually she breaks

2574
02:42:48,717 --> 02:42:52,907
through the water, carrying Grog, who's too heavy
for her, and then dips

2575
02:42:52,907 --> 02:42:54,519
right back down in the water.

2576
02:42:54,519 --> 02:42:55,749
MARISHA: Help!

2577
02:42:55,749 --> 02:42:58,232
TALIESIN: Pull Grog.

2578
02:42:58,232 --> 02:43:02,330
MATT: You grab and pull Grog out and onto the
edge, and he's locked in place, eyes wide.

2579
02:43:02,330 --> 02:43:07,947
MARISHA: Can I take the Control Water to see if I
can like waterbend it out of his lungs, if there's

2580
02:43:07,947 --> 02:43:09,269
any water in his lungs?

2581
02:43:09,269 --> 02:43:15,036
MATT: Yeah. As you concentrate, you pull this
single strain of water out of, it's the weirdest

2582
02:43:15,036 --> 02:43:19,006
sensation you've ever had, as the water is pumped
instantly from inside your lungs.

2583
02:43:19,006 --> 02:43:20,344
TRAVIS: It's like a reverse beer bong.

2584
02:43:20,344 --> 02:43:28,812
MATT: (laughs) Yeah, it is. And the water scatters
across the stonework on the side of the pool. It

2585
02:43:28,812 --> 02:43:31,815
takes about 30 seconds before your muscles come
back and all of a sudden you're--

2586
02:43:31,815 --> 02:43:35,101
TRAVIS: (coughing and choking)

2587
02:43:35,101 --> 02:43:37,710
LAURA: What the hell happened? What was down
there?

2588
02:43:37,710 --> 02:43:42,975
MARISHA: Really nasty plants. And I go over. I'm
pretty sure my Control Water

2589
02:43:42,975 --> 02:43:44,542
lasts for a minute, yeah?

2590
02:43:44,542 --> 02:43:47,431
MATT: Control Water lasts for up to ten minutes.
Concentration.

2591
02:43:47,431 --> 02:43:52,983
MARISHA: Dope. I'm going to go over, and can I
start clearing the water out of this tunnel?

2592
02:43:52,983 --> 02:43:56,287
MATT: Where would you want it to go?

2593
02:43:56,287 --> 02:43:58,712
MARISHA: Out?

2594
02:43:58,712 --> 02:44:01,119
LIAM: Up the stairs. Behind us is stairs up.

2595
02:44:01,119 --> 02:44:07,548
MATT: You can't make water disappear. You can part
it, you can do all kinds of things with it, the

2596
02:44:07,548 --> 02:44:09,854
water still has to go somewhere.

2597
02:44:09,854 --> 02:44:11,668
LIAM: Part it. An air tunnel for us.

2598
02:44:11,668 --> 02:44:13,324
MARISHA: That's what I was thinking, making like
an air tunnel.

2599
02:44:13,324 --> 02:44:17,166
MATT: Or you can redirect the flow. Up to you.
What do you want to do? The abilities you have to

2600
02:44:17,166 --> 02:44:22,358
choose from are part water, redirect flow,
whirlpool, but that's not really

2601
02:44:22,358 --> 02:44:24,526
in your realm, or flood.

2602
02:44:24,526 --> 02:44:26,665
MARISHA: And how big was this tunnel?

2603
02:44:26,665 --> 02:44:34,162
MATT: All the way across, I'd say it's about 25,
20 feet across.

2604
02:44:34,162 --> 02:44:36,263
MARISHA: That's a big tunnel. I'll part it.

2605
02:44:36,263 --> 02:44:37,579
MATT: Okay.

2606
02:44:37,579 --> 02:44:38,682
MARISHA: Yeah.

2607
02:44:38,682 --> 02:44:43,011
MATT: So you dive back down? When are you starting
to part it?

2608
02:44:43,011 --> 02:44:49,394
MARISHA: I yell to everybody else and I say,
there's a tunnel through to the other side. Let's

2609
02:44:49,394 --> 02:44:54,161
go. And I jump in and I'll sink and I'll start
parting the water behind me.

2610
02:44:54,161 --> 02:44:56,256
MATT: All right. So.

2611
02:44:56,256 --> 02:45:00,201
MARISHA: Or, let me see, let me sink to the bottom
and then I'll part the water in the tunnel

2612
02:45:00,201 --> 02:45:01,815
straight ahead.

2613
02:45:01,815 --> 02:45:03,580
MATT: Okay. Do you guys follow suit?

2614
02:45:03,580 --> 02:45:04,731
TALIESIN: I follow.

2615
02:45:04,731 --> 02:45:05,751
LAURA: Yeah.

2616
02:45:05,751 --> 02:45:06,988
SAM: Are we diving into water or parted water?

2617
02:45:06,988 --> 02:45:08,518
MATT: You're diving into water right now.

2618
02:45:08,518 --> 02:45:10,819
MARISHA: And before I jump in, I say, don't touch
the plants on the edge.

2619
02:45:10,819 --> 02:45:13,484
LIAM: So we're going through water to get to air.

2620
02:45:13,484 --> 02:45:15,453
MARISHA: Yeah, that's what I'm hoping for, yeah.

2621
02:45:15,453 --> 02:45:17,470
LAURA: Is it a fast drop, or do we float down with
that water?

2622
02:45:17,470 --> 02:45:20,567
MATT: You float down, because she didn't part the
water of the top of the tunnel, you guys float

2623
02:45:20,567 --> 02:45:26,467
down at a natural pace, eventually touching the
bottom of the subterranean tunnel, holding your

2624
02:45:26,467 --> 02:45:31,330
breath. Keyleth moves her hands this way and the
water in the center of the tunnel actually parts

2625
02:45:31,330 --> 02:45:33,398
almost like a bubble in front of you.

2626
02:45:33,398 --> 02:45:34,843
LAURA: Nice!

2627
02:45:34,843 --> 02:45:39,374
MATT: You step into that open space now and you
can breathe. You all catch yourself--

2628
02:45:39,374 --> 02:45:41,592
MARISHA: Let's go fast while I still have this
concentration.

2629
02:45:41,592 --> 02:45:45,613
MATT: There's still droplets dropping around you.
As you're holding it at bay and you push it off to

2630
02:45:45,613 --> 02:45:49,851
the side, elements, a lot of the water has been
forced out of the top for the time being wherever

2631
02:45:49,851 --> 02:45:50,934
you're going--

2632
02:45:50,934 --> 02:45:52,249
MARISHA: Sure, displacement physics.

2633
02:45:52,249 --> 02:45:56,896
MATT: Yeah. However, the planet life that was
currently drifting freely is all to the ground,

2634
02:45:56,896 --> 02:46:02,431
and is this giant mass of plant matter on the
ground that is soaking wet and there.

2635
02:46:02,431 --> 02:46:04,689
MARISHA: Okay. Don't touch the plants, let's go.

2636
02:46:04,689 --> 02:46:06,179
LAURA: Go where?

2637
02:46:06,179 --> 02:46:07,499
MARISHA: Forward.

2638
02:46:07,499 --> 02:46:09,373
LIAM: Is it covering like a rug all in front of
us?

2639
02:46:09,373 --> 02:46:13,319
MATT: I mean, there is plant matter all over the
entire surface. It's thicker on the edges, because

2640
02:46:13,319 --> 02:46:15,710
a lot of it dropped down on itself.

2641
02:46:15,710 --> 02:46:17,235
LIAM: So are we able to pick our way through?

2642
02:46:17,235 --> 02:46:22,182
MATT: Yeah, it looks like a bunch of wet fur on
the sides. You guys begin walking, what's the

2643
02:46:22,182 --> 02:46:25,840
marching order here? Who's going first?

2644
02:46:25,840 --> 02:46:28,081
TRAVIS: I'll go first because I'm at disadvantage
on everything, so.

2645
02:46:28,081 --> 02:46:31,040
MATT: Okay. Grog goes first.

2646
02:46:31,040 --> 02:46:32,431
LIAM: I'll go behind Grog.

2647
02:46:32,431 --> 02:46:33,625
MATT: Okay. Who's after that?

2648
02:46:33,625 --> 02:46:35,075
LAURA: I'll go next.

2649
02:46:35,075 --> 02:46:37,216
SAM: I'll take Pike and go after her.

2650
02:46:37,216 --> 02:46:39,364
TALIESIN: I'll go behind them.

2651
02:46:39,364 --> 02:46:41,097
MARISHA: Following up their rears.

2652
02:46:41,097 --> 02:46:45,623
MATT: And Keyleth's following up the rear. Okay.
Has Trinket stepped back into your necklace, by

2653
02:46:45,623 --> 02:46:46,660
the way?

2654
02:46:46,660 --> 02:46:47,883
LAURA: Yes yes yes.

2655
02:46:47,883 --> 02:46:49,137
MATT: Okay. Just making sure.

2656
02:46:49,137 --> 02:46:50,433
TRAVIS: Hold it up, show him.

2657
02:46:50,433 --> 02:46:51,645
LAURA: He's in my necklace.

2658
02:46:51,645 --> 02:46:55,634
MATT: Grog, as you step past, and you're stepping
with a squashing sound as your footfalls hit each

2659
02:46:55,634 --> 02:47:03,577
of the sections of the dark brown-greenish plant
matter. It's really soggy, and Keyleth, as you're

2660
02:47:03,577 --> 02:47:09,243
concentrating, it's a lot of water to part, and
you're basically creating this 20-foot tunnel. As

2661
02:47:09,243 --> 02:47:14,741
you begin stepping across, you can see the red
vines begin to pull their way out, but without the

2662
02:47:14,741 --> 02:47:26,514
water there, they can't support the weight of the
vine itself, so currently they're unable to really

2663
02:47:26,514 --> 02:47:30,782
shift in your direction. You can see them trying,
you can see the vines (slithering) in the matted

2664
02:47:30,782 --> 02:47:33,301
mass, but they can't actually work towards--

2665
02:47:33,301 --> 02:47:34,546
LAURA: Can't move quickly.

2666
02:47:34,546 --> 02:47:36,067
MARISHA: They're assholes, don't touch them.

2667
02:47:36,067 --> 02:47:38,811
MATT: So as you dart across, you guys each
individually make your way across the other side

2668
02:47:38,811 --> 02:47:42,450
of the tunnel where the Control Water spell ends.
You can see the curvature leading upward, there is

2669
02:47:42,450 --> 02:47:47,359
still that barrier of water that's shimmering
right there in front of you. You all eventually

2670
02:47:47,359 --> 02:47:55,406
make it past that big central patch, and as it
curves upward, you can look about 35 feet at a

2671
02:47:55,406 --> 02:47:59,734
diagonal that way, you can see the surface of
water that's where it breaks.

2672
02:47:59,734 --> 02:48:01,414
LAURA: Oh. Swim up.

2673
02:48:01,414 --> 02:48:06,737
MARISHA: Can I take the Control Water and jettison
us all up like I did with Grog?

2674
02:48:06,737 --> 02:48:07,777
MATT: Yeah.

2675
02:48:07,777 --> 02:48:08,953
MARISHA: Hold on!

2676
02:48:08,953 --> 02:48:16,071
MATT: So you guys all take a breath as the water
wall collapses behind you, rushes up, and like a

2677
02:48:16,071 --> 02:48:20,454
water jet all of you get jettisoned out and have
to catch yourself on your feet.

2678
02:48:20,454 --> 02:48:22,143
MARISHA: Three-point landing.

2679
02:48:22,143 --> 02:48:24,332
LAURA: I catch myself on the broom and I fly.

2680
02:48:24,332 --> 02:48:29,464
TRAVIS: I definitely roll. How does Scanlan land?

2681
02:48:29,464 --> 02:48:31,454
SAM: Not well.

2682
02:48:31,454 --> 02:48:37,225
MATT: (laughs) Scanlan's more like a waterslide,
he comes out the end and feet in the air. It's

2683
02:48:37,225 --> 02:48:40,821
fun, but--

2684
02:48:40,821 --> 02:48:42,150
SAM: Slip-and-slide?

2685
02:48:42,150 --> 02:48:45,607
MATT: Yeah! But you hit the sprinkler head you
didn't know was under there.

2686
02:48:45,607 --> 02:48:46,989
(groaning)

2687
02:48:46,989 --> 02:48:48,472
TRAVIS: The worst!

2688
02:48:48,472 --> 02:48:49,484
SAM: There's a rock.

2689
02:48:49,484 --> 02:48:52,452
TRAVIS: We all know what you're talking about. You
haven't lived.

2690
02:48:52,452 --> 02:48:55,066
MARISHA: Those things are death traps, man.
They're the best.

2691
02:48:55,066 --> 02:48:57,661
LAURA: And when they're not wet enough.

2692
02:48:57,661 --> 02:49:07,861
MATT: So you guys all emerge outside of this pool
now. You take a moment to look around as there is

2693
02:49:07,861 --> 02:49:14,141
no light source in this room either. Those with
darkvision, you look around and you see what

2694
02:49:14,141 --> 02:49:23,105
appears to be a smooth, marble stone floor, very
intricately carved, with four pillars surrounding

2695
02:49:23,105 --> 02:49:29,656
the exit of the pool that you guys came out of.
You can see on each of these pillars, facing

2696
02:49:29,656 --> 02:49:34,783
inward, or not inward, sorry, facing outward of
these pillars, what looks to be these stone lion

2697
02:49:34,783 --> 02:49:42,534
heads. They each face outward. The chamber is also
circular, but much larger, it's actually 60 feet

2698
02:49:42,534 --> 02:49:45,589
across, from the 30 feet of the first chamber you
came to.

2699
02:49:45,589 --> 02:49:49,917
LIAM: Right where we are, I'm going to take my
Flametongue dagger and go in a circle and detect

2700
02:49:49,917 --> 02:49:51,367
traps. Detect some traps.

2701
02:49:51,367 --> 02:49:54,085
MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.

2702
02:49:54,085 --> 02:49:55,979
LIAM: 18.

2703
02:49:55,979 --> 02:49:59,948
MATT: 18, okay. As you glance around with the
dagger, and now that you have light as opposed to

2704
02:49:59,948 --> 02:50:06,159
the darkvision that was before, you can see now.
The room is a very deep blue cobalt marble, and

2705
02:50:06,159 --> 02:50:11,602
the edges of each of these intricately carved
pillars, where the base hits the rest of the

2706
02:50:11,602 --> 02:50:18,738
structure, and along the walls you can see what
looks like gold and platinum filigree and trim.

2707
02:50:18,738 --> 02:50:29,720
It's a very beautifully, very elegantly built
room. You look around the walls. They themselves

2708
02:50:29,720 --> 02:50:34,813
are smooth with, once again, no door, no exit,
however, you look around the outside of the pool

2709
02:50:34,813 --> 02:50:42,490
that you came out of, and there is a
three-foot-wide gold loop around it, almost like

2710
02:50:42,490 --> 02:50:50,108
there's a big circular gold plate that surrounds
the pool, and inside it is carved a language that

2711
02:50:50,108 --> 02:50:52,749
you can't understand. You recognize it again as
Celestial.

2712
02:50:52,749 --> 02:50:53,930
TALIESIN: Oh dear.

2713
02:50:53,930 --> 02:50:55,247
MARISHA: What does it say?

2714
02:50:55,247 --> 02:50:56,705
TALIESIN: Dagger again?

2715
02:50:56,705 --> 02:51:12,492
MATT: All right, this one translates to: "Betwixt
the chaos, our order reigns, the ones who made us,

2716
02:51:12,492 --> 02:51:17,937
"refined the planes. As ages die--"

2717
02:51:17,937 --> 02:51:22,275
MARISHA: Hang on. "The ones who made us--"

2718
02:51:22,275 --> 02:51:47,017
MATT: "Refined the planes. As ages die, their time
an ember, the four endure, the four remember."

2719
02:51:47,017 --> 02:51:50,032
SAM: Aren't there four dragons?

2720
02:51:50,032 --> 02:51:53,155
TRAVIS: That can't be what this is about.

2721
02:51:53,155 --> 02:51:54,642
SAM: Why not?

2722
02:51:54,642 --> 02:51:57,061
MARISHA: Because we killed one of them.

2723
02:51:57,061 --> 02:51:58,452
LAURA: It could be four sphinxes.

2724
02:51:58,452 --> 02:52:00,014
TALIESIN: There's four lion heads in the room.

2725
02:52:00,014 --> 02:52:05,088
MATT: As you look up as well, as you glance at
more of the scenery, and you put the dagger up,

2726
02:52:05,088 --> 02:52:12,303
right above where the pool is, there is a
beautiful circular mural, the size of the room

2727
02:52:12,303 --> 02:52:14,901
itself, 60 feet across from end to end.

2728
02:52:14,901 --> 02:52:16,185
LAURA: How high is the ceiling?

2729
02:52:16,185 --> 02:52:18,429
MATT: The ceiling is 40 feet tall.

2730
02:52:18,429 --> 02:52:26,815
LIAM: If it's in Celestial and it says, "those who
made us," I highly doubt that the dragons are the

2731
02:52:26,815 --> 02:52:29,485
ones that made the architects of this structure.

2732
02:52:29,485 --> 02:52:34,940
MARISHA: If you recall, there were also five
dragons and we killed one of them already.

2733
02:52:34,940 --> 02:52:36,939
LAURA: Yeah, it's four sphinxes.

2734
02:52:36,939 --> 02:52:39,281
SAM: Four somethings in the room.

2735
02:52:39,281 --> 02:52:48,840
MATT: Glancing up across the mural, this
beautifully painted image shows flames twisting

2736
02:52:48,840 --> 02:52:58,504
and writhing in an arced pattern that then twist
into broken rock and soil and earth and mountains

2737
02:52:58,504 --> 02:53:07,571
that then break once again, sinking into an angry
ocean, and that ocean then begins to rise into

2738
02:53:07,571 --> 02:53:13,170
clouds into the sky, those clouds then dissipating
and turning into raw flame

2739
02:53:13,170 --> 02:53:14,952
and continuing the loop.

2740
02:53:14,952 --> 02:53:17,343
MARISHA: It's the water cycle.

2741
02:53:17,343 --> 02:53:19,040
SAM: Elements.

2742
02:53:19,040 --> 02:53:26,722
MATT: In the center of this loop, there is a
single dark hole in the ceiling.

2743
02:53:26,722 --> 02:53:31,776
LAURA: I'm flying, so I'm up near it. Can I
investigate it?

2744
02:53:31,776 --> 02:53:33,338
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2745
02:53:33,338 --> 02:53:34,601
LIAM: Careful, please?

2746
02:53:34,601 --> 02:53:37,421
LAURA: I'm not poking my head into it, I want to
get a closer look.

2747
02:53:37,421 --> 02:53:40,439
TRAVIS: That's what she said last time.

2748
02:53:40,439 --> 02:53:42,197
MATT: Scanlan, make an intelligence check.

2749
02:53:42,197 --> 02:53:44,585
LAURA: Investigation or perception? You said
perception?

2750
02:53:44,585 --> 02:53:46,613
MATT: What are you looking for?

2751
02:53:46,613 --> 02:53:49,628
LAURA: I just want to get a closer look at the
circle.

2752
02:53:49,628 --> 02:53:51,936
MATT: Make it perception. I'll say sure, why not.

2753
02:53:51,936 --> 02:53:54,205
LAURA: 19?

2754
02:53:54,205 --> 02:53:59,857
MATT: Okay, glancing at the circle, I mean, it has
a similar small gold band around the outside of

2755
02:53:59,857 --> 02:54:08,675
it, but this mural is built around this central
hole. It's about three feet across, it's not very

2756
02:54:08,675 --> 02:54:14,009
big, and it goes straight up into darkness.

2757
02:54:14,009 --> 02:54:19,812
LAURA: It said in the previous room, "the sky is a
window." Does that pertain to this?

2758
02:54:19,812 --> 02:54:21,438
TALIESIN: It might.

2759
02:54:21,438 --> 02:54:23,398
MARISHA: It could. It said, "the water a door."

2760
02:54:23,398 --> 02:54:25,036
LAURA: Which we came through.

2761
02:54:25,036 --> 02:54:27,029
MARISHA: Wait, and the hole is right above the
water, correct?

2762
02:54:27,029 --> 02:54:28,347
MATT: Correct.

2763
02:54:28,347 --> 02:54:30,736
MARISHA: It lines up. It lines up.

2764
02:54:30,736 --> 02:54:34,617
TALIESIN: Vax, double-check the gold floor, I'm
not--

2765
02:54:34,617 --> 02:54:38,502
LAURA: Are there any runes on the gold around that
circle on the ceiling?

2766
02:54:38,502 --> 02:54:48,488
MATT: Looking around the gold itself, no, but
you're looking at the actual mural itself this

2767
02:54:48,488 --> 02:54:54,265
close up, there is a texture to the painting
itself, and you can see embedded within elements

2768
02:54:54,265 --> 02:55:02,570
of the actual brushwork and where the flames meet
the rock, you can see hidden lines. With what

2769
02:55:02,570 --> 02:55:04,853
appear to be very very faint runes.

2770
02:55:04,853 --> 02:55:07,406
LAURA: Is it the same language that was around
the--

2771
02:55:07,406 --> 02:55:13,397
MATT: It's a language you don't understand. This
is not a spoken language.

2772
02:55:13,397 --> 02:55:16,009
What languages do you know?

2773
02:55:16,009 --> 02:55:18,461
LAURA: Abyssal, Draconic, Elvish--

2774
02:55:18,461 --> 02:55:22,893
MATT: These are rooted in Draconic. Very ancient,
this is the basis of what most arcane runes are

2775
02:55:22,893 --> 02:55:30,645
created from, as Draconic is the base root of
arcane writing. None of them spell anything you

2776
02:55:30,645 --> 02:55:35,227
understand with your knowledge of Draconic,
however that is the base root of this writing, as

2777
02:55:35,227 --> 02:55:36,689
ancient as it is.

2778
02:55:36,689 --> 02:55:40,358
LIAM: Pike? Does this mean anything to you?

2779
02:55:40,358 --> 02:55:46,215
SAM: By the way, Matt, I rolled my second natural
one of the night for my intelligence check.

2780
02:55:46,215 --> 02:55:48,334
MATT: Okay. You have no idea what this is about,
yeah.

2781
02:55:48,334 --> 02:55:49,916
SAM: I'm trying to get water out of my ear.

2782
02:55:49,916 --> 02:55:53,885
MATT: Pike's looking up and says, "This is beyond
me, this is very old."

2783
02:55:53,885 --> 02:56:00,437
MARISHA: Does this harken back to anything that we
remember about the telling of the Spark, or the

2784
02:56:00,437 --> 02:56:01,774
Second Spark?

2785
02:56:01,774 --> 02:56:05,937
MATT: You know, I'm going to make a religion check
with her. Not bad. She goes, "Best I can gather,

2786
02:56:05,937 --> 02:56:17,415
"these represent the elemental chaos, and the
center is the prime, our world, that was crafted

2787
02:56:17,415 --> 02:56:26,366
"out of that chaos when the gods came, just like we
were told at the Platinum Sanctuary. That's what

2788
02:56:26,366 --> 02:56:28,336
"you told me you found there."

2789
02:56:28,336 --> 02:56:34,328
MARISHA: All of the elemental realms overlap,
which create our realm. Which is why there's

2790
02:56:34,328 --> 02:56:35,682
gateways.

2791
02:56:35,682 --> 02:56:37,687
TRAVIS: Can I walk over to one of the pillars?

2792
02:56:37,687 --> 02:56:38,903
MATT: Yeah.

2793
02:56:38,903 --> 02:56:40,640
TRAVIS: Is it covered with anything?

2794
02:56:40,640 --> 02:56:47,743
MATT: They're all the same, and they all have that
giant gold stone lion head facing outward from

2795
02:56:47,743 --> 02:56:48,834
each of the pillars.

2796
02:56:48,834 --> 02:56:50,950
TRAVIS: Is there writing or anything fancy on the
pillar?

2797
02:56:50,950 --> 02:56:52,546
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2798
02:56:52,546 --> 02:56:55,204
LAURA: I grab the Hunk of Quall and I float it up
to the ceiling.

2799
02:56:55,204 --> 02:56:56,963
MARISHA: I gave Vex the Hunk of Quall.

2800
02:56:56,963 --> 02:56:58,714
TRAVIS: Hey! 15 with a minus two.

2801
02:56:58,714 --> 02:57:02,199
MATT: Nothing really catches your attention.

2802
02:57:02,199 --> 02:57:03,442
TRAVIS: Can I knock on it?

2803
02:57:03,442 --> 02:57:06,027
MATT: Solid. Cobalt marble.

2804
02:57:06,027 --> 02:57:08,861
TALIESIN: The lion heads. Do they have open mouths
or closed mouths?

2805
02:57:08,861 --> 02:57:13,069
MATT: The mouths are closed. You take the Quall--

2806
02:57:13,069 --> 02:57:14,831
LAURA: I take the Hunk up to the ceiling.

2807
02:57:14,831 --> 02:57:16,970
MATT: All right. What are you doing with it?

2808
02:57:16,970 --> 02:57:18,770
LAURA: How did you make this work, Keyleth?

2809
02:57:18,770 --> 02:57:22,607
MARISHA: Just hold it out like you're searching
for a signal.

2810
02:57:22,607 --> 02:57:30,337
MATT: Okay, you hold it up, and you see the bauble
glows ever so faintly, and whenever you drift it

2811
02:57:30,337 --> 02:57:37,099
over the mural, all the runes that are within a
foot of it slightly glow as it passes over them,

2812
02:57:37,099 --> 02:57:41,259
almost like a blacklight. It reveals them ever so
faintly.

2813
02:57:41,259 --> 02:57:44,270
LAURA: Does that mean these are magic? I can't
remember what this thing does.

2814
02:57:44,270 --> 02:57:48,217
MARISHA: Yeah, it means that there's magical
essence, it finds magic.

2815
02:57:48,217 --> 02:57:56,839
TALIESIN: I'm going to take some of the water from
the pool, and I'm going to bring it to one of the

2816
02:57:56,839 --> 02:57:59,124
columns and dash it on the column and see what
happens.

2817
02:57:59,124 --> 02:58:02,815
MATT: Okay. You take the water--

2818
02:58:02,815 --> 02:58:05,647
TALIESIN: On the, yeah, the water column.

2819
02:58:05,647 --> 02:58:11,333
MATT: You throw it on the column that matches the
water overhead. You feel this slight grinding

2820
02:58:11,333 --> 02:58:13,133
shift of stone.

2821
02:58:13,133 --> 02:58:15,314
LAURA: Wind blows! Fire burns!

2822
02:58:15,314 --> 02:58:18,485
TALIESIN: Really? Really? We had to bring it
there? Really?

2823
02:58:18,485 --> 02:58:21,867
MATT: You glance around and the lion's mouth has
opened.

2824
02:58:21,867 --> 02:58:25,561
MARISHA: Good call, Percy!

2825
02:58:25,561 --> 02:58:28,421
SAM: Wait, what are the other elements? Fire,
air?

2826
02:58:28,421 --> 02:58:31,212
LAURA: Yeah, I go over to one of the other pillars
and blow on it, the one under the air part.

2827
02:58:31,212 --> 02:58:36,117
MATT: Same crumbling sound of stone and the mouth
of the lion is now open.

2828
02:58:36,117 --> 02:58:37,657
TRAVIS: Ooh, ooh, fire, fire!

2829
02:58:37,657 --> 02:58:39,612
LIAM: I use the Flametongue dagger.

2830
02:58:39,612 --> 02:58:43,285
MATT: As you brush it across the pillar, once
again, the lion mouth opens on the

2831
02:58:43,285 --> 02:58:44,521
outside of the pillar.

2832
02:58:44,521 --> 02:58:45,715
LAURA: How do we do earth?

2833
02:58:45,715 --> 02:58:48,267
SAM: She's an earth elemental, or she can do
earthy things.

2834
02:58:48,267 --> 02:58:53,309
MARISHA: Well, I Druidcraft some earth and start
wrapping it around the pillar.

2835
02:58:53,309 --> 02:59:01,809
MATT: Okay. You create this little burst of soil,
this little knob of wet mud and clay, and you

2836
02:59:01,809 --> 02:59:09,309
circle it, smear across the side of the pillar.
The fourth mouth opens. There's a low rumble.

2837
02:59:09,309 --> 02:59:22,563
Suddenly each mouth of the lion begins to pour a
constant cavalcade of sand. The pool immediately

2838
02:59:22,563 --> 02:59:30,682
fills up, you guys noticing, this room, as wide as
it is, across the way other holes have opened up

2839
02:59:30,682 --> 02:59:32,585
in the side and sand is pouring in.

2840
02:59:32,585 --> 02:59:36,541
LAURA: Oh shit. I fly up into the hole in the
ceiling--

2841
02:59:36,541 --> 02:59:39,867
TRAVIS: Oh! A fucking hourglass?

2842
02:59:39,867 --> 02:59:41,641
(yelling)

2843
02:59:41,641 --> 02:59:46,059
LAURA: I fly up into the hole. I drop the endless
rope down from the hole as I'm flying it up so

2844
02:59:46,059 --> 02:59:50,703
there's a rope in the middle of the room; so that
everybody can go for, I'm flying up--

2845
02:59:50,703 --> 02:59:53,070
SAM: If the sand fills up, we can ride the sand up
to the hole.

2846
02:59:53,070 --> 03:00:01,331
MATT: So you ride up through the top, you go up
about 60 feet to the very top before you get

2847
03:00:01,331 --> 03:00:05,599
there. You have to take a second to go ahead and
rummage and find the rope. The rope is on you at

2848
03:00:05,599 --> 03:00:06,515
all times?

2849
03:00:06,515 --> 03:00:07,399
LAURA: Yeah.

2850
03:00:07,399 --> 03:00:09,171
MATT: Not in the Bag of Holding?

2851
03:00:09,171 --> 03:00:11,755
LAURA: No, it's on my cloak. Rope of Infinite
Twine.

2852
03:00:11,755 --> 03:00:14,267
MATT: Right, it's a robe. It's--

2853
03:00:14,267 --> 03:00:18,673
TRAVIS: It's a robe, it's not a rope. It's from
the inside of a robe or jacket.

2854
03:00:18,673 --> 03:00:20,138
MATT: A pocket on the inside of the robe.

2855
03:00:20,138 --> 03:00:21,204
LAURA: Oh.

2856
03:00:21,204 --> 03:00:25,632
MATT: So. You would have to get that from Grog
first, it was probably in the Bag of Holding.

2857
03:00:25,632 --> 03:00:28,877
LAURA: Fuck! All right, fine, I fly back down--
Gimme gimme gimme the rope.

2858
03:00:28,877 --> 03:00:30,004
TRAVIS: I give it.

2859
03:00:30,004 --> 03:00:33,801
MATT: Okay, at this point the sand has now come up
to your knees, waist area, and you're having to

2860
03:00:33,801 --> 03:00:35,283
climb out and get on top.

2861
03:00:35,283 --> 03:00:39,011
LIAM: Scanlan, grab your horn, call out, say that
Osysa sent us.

2862
03:00:39,011 --> 03:00:41,296
LAURA: I tell him to hold on to one end as I fly
up.

2863
03:00:41,296 --> 03:00:42,629
LIAM: Don't you have a cone?

2864
03:00:42,629 --> 03:00:49,317
MATT: The weight of both of you across it,
especially with your weight, the broom (pff).

2865
03:00:49,317 --> 03:00:52,973
LAURA: I let go, the rope should be coming out of
the robe.

2866
03:00:52,973 --> 03:00:55,255
MATT: Right, okay. I thought you were trying to
lift him up with you.

2867
03:00:55,255 --> 03:00:57,477
LAURA: No no no, I'm trying to let the rope out as
I'm flying up.

2868
03:00:57,477 --> 03:01:01,813
MATT: Okay. You pull up and you come off the top
again into this chamber that leads into it. You

2869
03:01:01,813 --> 03:01:04,655
can see with what your vision is a tunnel that
leads ahead to a set of double metal doors.

2870
03:01:04,655 --> 03:01:06,818
LAURA: Is there anything to tie rope off onto?

2871
03:01:06,818 --> 03:01:08,116
MATT: No.

2872
03:01:08,116 --> 03:01:10,268
LAURA: What about the doors? Are there handles?

2873
03:01:10,268 --> 03:01:13,717
MATT: From what you can look over there, no. They
are solid metal.

2874
03:01:13,717 --> 03:01:15,082
LAURA: Shit.

2875
03:01:15,082 --> 03:01:17,280
LIAM: Scanlan, can I borrow your horn? Your cone?

2876
03:01:17,280 --> 03:01:18,884
SAM: Yes, I can yell.

2877
03:01:18,884 --> 03:01:23,266
MATT: At this point, about half the room is filled
now.

2878
03:01:23,266 --> 03:01:24,883
TALIESIN: Okay.

2879
03:01:24,883 --> 03:01:28,853
LIAM: I grab Scanlan's horn. Osysa sent us, can
you hear us?

2880
03:01:28,853 --> 03:01:32,018
MATT: You hear that voice echo up through.

2881
03:01:32,018 --> 03:01:39,090
MARISHA: Gather close next to me, who's close
nearby? I do a Wall of Stone as a pillar and

2882
03:01:39,090 --> 03:01:41,792
pillar us up towards the hole.

2883
03:01:41,792 --> 03:01:43,078
MATT: Okay.

2884
03:01:43,078 --> 03:01:44,899
MARISHA: Elevator time.

2885
03:01:44,899 --> 03:01:49,628
MATT: It is a three-foot-wide hole. You'll be able
to fit one person through there.

2886
03:01:49,628 --> 03:01:54,243
MARISHA: Can I at least rise us up to where we're
close and we can get there?

2887
03:01:54,243 --> 03:01:55,419
MATT: Okay, yeah, so.

2888
03:01:55,419 --> 03:01:56,724
MARISHA: Where we're up and out.

2889
03:01:56,724 --> 03:02:00,513
MATT: So you get up out of the sand, now you guys
have been climbing up best you can, but as the

2890
03:02:00,513 --> 03:02:04,800
nature of sand you're still pulling in, as it's
pouring in now, you see now, parts of the ceiling

2891
03:02:04,800 --> 03:02:05,903
are starting to open.

2892
03:02:05,903 --> 03:02:07,286
LAURA: Keyleth! Do you have the Immovable Rod?

2893
03:02:07,286 --> 03:02:08,471
MARISHA: I do have the Immovable Rod.

2894
03:02:08,471 --> 03:02:09,998
LAURA: I fly down and I grab the Immovable Rod.

2895
03:02:09,998 --> 03:02:11,543
MARISHA: Here, catch, yeah, take it!

2896
03:02:11,543 --> 03:02:16,085
MATT: Okay, you grab the rod. You fly up, you take
the rod and you set it in place there.

2897
03:02:16,085 --> 03:02:17,787
LAURA: Tie the rope onto it.

2898
03:02:17,787 --> 03:02:20,388
MATT: Tie the rope onto it. All right. At this
point now the sand's pushed up. You guys are on

2899
03:02:20,388 --> 03:02:22,568
the last ten feet before it hits the ceiling.

2900
03:02:22,568 --> 03:02:23,717
LAURA: Climb it, climb it.

2901
03:02:23,717 --> 03:02:27,078
TALIESIN: Climbing, climbing the rope, climbing
the rope.

2902
03:02:27,078 --> 03:02:30,793
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to go
and turn into a bird.

2903
03:02:30,793 --> 03:02:33,574
LAURA: Can I fly back down and grab Scanlan?

2904
03:02:33,574 --> 03:02:34,844
SAM: I'm okay.

2905
03:02:34,844 --> 03:02:38,347
LAURA: Well I go down and I grab Pike then and I
go up on the broom.

2906
03:02:38,347 --> 03:02:40,148
MATT: Okay. Pike goes, "Thank you!"

2907
03:02:40,148 --> 03:02:45,921
You grab her and she holds onto the edge of
the broom and you guys make it up that way. No,

2908
03:02:45,921 --> 03:02:50,120
since the hole is just small enough where you
pretty much have to go through single-file, so

2909
03:02:50,120 --> 03:02:54,330
nobody else can climb while you're doing that. You
guys go through, who's coming up first?

2910
03:02:54,330 --> 03:02:55,446
MARISHA: I'm flying.

2911
03:02:55,446 --> 03:02:57,071
MATT: You fly up after them. Who's going up
first?

2912
03:02:57,071 --> 03:02:58,272
TALIESIN: I'll go up next.

2913
03:02:58,272 --> 03:03:00,419
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an athletics check.

2914
03:03:00,419 --> 03:03:01,880
TALIESIN: Athletics or acrobatics?

2915
03:03:01,880 --> 03:03:03,704
MATT: This would be athletics, because you're
climbing a rope, a tiny--

2916
03:03:03,704 --> 03:03:05,444
SAM: The hole, is it triangular?

2917
03:03:05,444 --> 03:03:06,773
MATT: No, it's circular.

2918
03:03:06,773 --> 03:03:08,770
TALIESIN: 19.

2919
03:03:08,770 --> 03:03:16,617
MATT: 19, okay. Making your way up. It's a long
pull.

2920
03:03:16,617 --> 03:03:17,840
TALIESIN: I'm going to Batman.

2921
03:03:17,840 --> 03:03:19,318
MATT: All right. Who's up next?

2922
03:03:19,318 --> 03:03:21,841
LIAM: I'd like to use acrobatics to ignore the
rope and use the sides of this little tunnel to do

2923
03:03:21,841 --> 03:03:23,253
that going up.

2924
03:03:23,253 --> 03:03:25,230
MATT: Okay, okay, go ahead and do that.

2925
03:03:25,230 --> 03:03:27,596
LIAM: That is 25.

2926
03:03:27,596 --> 03:03:29,550
MATT: 25, okay, that keeps you going.

2927
03:03:29,550 --> 03:03:32,507
So you guys get up a third of the way, who's
after you?

2928
03:03:32,507 --> 03:03:36,384
SAM: I guess I'm climbing the rope. There's a
rope, yes? Climbing that rope.

2929
03:03:36,384 --> 03:03:38,127
MATT: Yep. Make an athletics check.

2930
03:03:38,127 --> 03:03:39,470
SAM: Okay.

2931
03:03:39,470 --> 03:03:43,329
17.

2932
03:03:43,329 --> 03:03:47,792
MATT: 17, okay. You guys are all making it up, you
get about a third of the way up, I need the three

2933
03:03:47,792 --> 03:03:53,224
of you to make your checks again, as it is a very
tight space and it's a very, very heavy pull up.

2934
03:03:53,224 --> 03:03:54,481
You're just like--

2935
03:03:54,481 --> 03:03:55,884
LIAM: 25 again.

2936
03:03:55,884 --> 03:03:57,492
MATT: 25 again. Awesome.

2937
03:03:57,492 --> 03:03:58,594
SAM: 13.

2938
03:03:58,594 --> 03:03:59,460
TALIESIN: 23.

2939
03:03:59,460 --> 03:04:03,727
MATT: 23. You guys make it up two-thirds of the
pathway, now. You can see now the sand has reached

2940
03:04:03,727 --> 03:04:09,198
the bottom, and at this point, you guys who made
it up to the top, you look up as you notice part

2941
03:04:09,198 --> 03:04:15,499
of the stonework above goes (fwsh) and sand begins
to now fall directly on top of you guys, pushing

2942
03:04:15,499 --> 03:04:21,768
past you. I need you guys to make one more check,
with disadvantage because of the sand, because

2943
03:04:21,768 --> 03:04:25,103
that was what the time limit was going to do.

2944
03:04:25,103 --> 03:04:27,983
MARISHA: It's gone, it's gone!

2945
03:04:27,983 --> 03:04:31,470
MATT: As soon as the timer went out, that was when
the top one went boom, and capped off the top.

2946
03:04:31,470 --> 03:04:36,013
SAM: This is an athletics check?

2947
03:04:36,013 --> 03:04:37,210
MATT: This is athletics, yeah.

2948
03:04:37,210 --> 03:04:39,317
TRAVIS: No, not 27, 24.

2949
03:04:39,317 --> 03:04:46,496
MATT: 24. Right, this is you coming up from the
bottom. So you make it up a third of the way now.

2950
03:04:46,496 --> 03:04:47,966
What'd you roll with dis--?

2951
03:04:47,966 --> 03:04:48,828
SAM: 17.

2952
03:04:48,828 --> 03:04:49,956
MATT: 17 with disadvantage?

2953
03:04:49,956 --> 03:04:50,869
TALIESIN: 13.

2954
03:04:50,869 --> 03:04:52,025
LIAM: 25 acrobatics.

2955
03:04:52,025 --> 03:04:56,823
MATT: 25. You actually have to climb over Percy to
get past, because Percy's being held up from the

2956
03:04:56,823 --> 03:05:05,457
sand that is coming down. Grog, it's starting to
catch up to you. You, I need Vax and Scanlan, you

2957
03:05:05,457 --> 03:05:08,400
guys make it to the top and pull your weight out
of the sand that's now pouring

2958
03:05:08,400 --> 03:05:09,922
down in that tunnel.

2959
03:05:09,922 --> 03:05:11,508
SAM: The tunnel on top?

2960
03:05:11,508 --> 03:05:15,948
MATT: The top of the tunnel, yeah, you guys emerge
from it and you're now inside a chamber along

2961
03:05:15,948 --> 03:05:18,650
with Vex and Keyleth.

2962
03:05:18,650 --> 03:05:20,955
MARISHA: So the only people that are left are
Percy and Grog?

2963
03:05:20,955 --> 03:05:22,091
MATT: Percy and Grog.

2964
03:05:22,091 --> 03:05:23,030
SAM: Pike?

2965
03:05:23,030 --> 03:05:24,729
MATT: Pike was brought up by Vex.

2966
03:05:24,729 --> 03:05:27,034
TRAVIS: Second roll was 11, 19 total.

2967
03:05:27,034 --> 03:05:28,172
MATT: 19 total?

2968
03:05:28,172 --> 03:05:34,477
LIAM: I have a regular 50-foot rope and I'm tying
a loop and I'm going to throw it down towards Grog

2969
03:05:34,477 --> 03:05:38,115
and try to get it down so he can hold onto it and
help pull while he does what he's doing.

2970
03:05:38,115 --> 03:05:43,623
MARISHA: Can I cantrip a Gust against the sand to
try and blow some of it?

2971
03:05:43,623 --> 03:05:48,057
MATT: It's a lot of sand, you might be able to
help a little bit with your cantrip, it's more of

2972
03:05:48,057 --> 03:05:51,466
a puff of wind than a strong force, and it's a lot
of sand falling. It's not going to help

2973
03:05:51,466 --> 03:05:53,908
tremendously on this circumstance, unfortunately,
as a cantrip.

2974
03:05:53,908 --> 03:05:58,013
LAURA: Can I use Pike's shield and try to direct
it to where some of it isn't coming--?

2975
03:05:58,013 --> 03:06:00,968
MATT: Sure, go ahead and make a strength check.

2976
03:06:00,968 --> 03:06:04,247
LAURA: Oh, maybe Pike should do it, because she's
way stronger than me!

2977
03:06:04,247 --> 03:06:06,280
MATT: Okay. Pike's going to step forward.

2978
03:06:06,280 --> 03:06:07,670
LAURA: She's got 19 strength now!

2979
03:06:07,670 --> 03:06:09,154
SAM: Don't do this, Pike, don't do this.

2980
03:06:09,154 --> 03:06:11,618
MATT: "I have to do it."

2981
03:06:11,618 --> 03:06:18,544
She steps forward and puts her shield out.
All right. She manages to direct some of the flow,

2982
03:06:18,544 --> 03:06:25,046
which begins to spray onto the outside of the
room, begins to fill up one side, however that

2983
03:06:25,046 --> 03:06:28,143
does give a round of no disadvantage to Grog and
Percy. Roll again.

2984
03:06:28,143 --> 03:06:31,822
TRAVIS: Except I'm exhausted, right? So I have
disadvantage anyway.

2985
03:06:31,822 --> 03:06:33,200
MATT: Yes, you do.

2986
03:06:33,200 --> 03:06:36,787
TALIESIN: 17.

2987
03:06:36,787 --> 03:06:38,102
TRAVIS: 21.

2988
03:06:38,102 --> 03:06:43,911
MATT: You manage to make it up the rest of the
way. The rope, Percy comes out. Pull him up onto

2989
03:06:43,911 --> 03:06:51,797
the side. Pike, unfortunately, it's too much and
loses it. The sand comes rushing down on top of

2990
03:06:51,797 --> 03:06:52,787
you. What'd you roll?

2991
03:06:52,787 --> 03:06:53,870
TRAVIS: 21.

2992
03:06:53,870 --> 03:06:55,704
LIAM: I grab Grog by the beard and pull.

2993
03:06:55,704 --> 03:07:00,116
MATT: He's almost to the top, because you made one
check, that's your second check now. Need you to

2994
03:07:00,116 --> 03:07:02,971
make one more check now as the sand's pouring
down, it's now come up to you and it's starting to

2995
03:07:02,971 --> 03:07:05,919
grab the lower part of your legs, and you're
starting to feel yourself being buried.

2996
03:07:05,919 --> 03:07:09,732
LIAM: I'm pulling on his beard, can I cancel his
disadvantage?

2997
03:07:09,732 --> 03:07:18,532
MATT: The rope that came down-- Roll a perception
check, Grog. With disadvantage.

2998
03:07:18,532 --> 03:07:19,840
What did you roll?

2999
03:07:19,840 --> 03:07:25,460
TRAVIS: Perception is four, but I
rolled a 24 on my fourth--

3000
03:07:25,460 --> 03:07:26,445
MATT: With disadvantage?

3001
03:07:26,445 --> 03:07:27,699
TRAVIS and LAURA: Yeah.

3002
03:07:27,699 --> 03:07:30,752
MATT: Nice! So you don't even see the rope that
Vax dropped. It keeps in the sand. But you,

3003
03:07:30,752 --> 03:07:34,115
grabbing onto the one that's already up there, you
hand-over-hand pull up. You guys watch as the sand

3004
03:07:34,115 --> 03:07:45,497
eventually stops, and fills the entirety of the
tunnel and stops. And then (thud, slam) Grog pulls

3005
03:07:45,497 --> 03:07:48,587
himself outside, manages to brush the sand off,
it's all in his beard.

3006
03:07:48,587 --> 03:07:49,919
MARISHA: Grog!

3007
03:07:49,919 --> 03:07:53,566
TRAVIS: How about a short rest?

3008
03:07:53,566 --> 03:07:55,685
(laughter)

3009
03:07:55,685 --> 03:07:58,755
TRAVIS: Anyone feel like a nap? Fucking hell.

3010
03:07:58,755 --> 03:08:02,932
LIAM: I start shaking out his beard and getting
all the crap out.

3011
03:08:02,932 --> 03:08:04,172
TRAVIS: Yeah, thank you.

3012
03:08:04,172 --> 03:08:06,176
LIAM: And it's like, fwang!

3013
03:08:06,176 --> 03:08:07,938
MARISHA: I cantrip Gust, brush him off.

3014
03:08:07,938 --> 03:08:10,106
LAURA: I thought we were doing what we were
supposed to do down there.

3015
03:08:10,106 --> 03:08:11,881
SAM: I think we did do what we were supposed to
do.

3016
03:08:11,881 --> 03:08:15,647
LAURA: Jeez, it would've been better if we
would've just gone up the hole.

3017
03:08:15,647 --> 03:08:17,033
MARISHA: Yeah.

3018
03:08:17,033 --> 03:08:21,351
TRAVIS: Fuck, I've never rolled that well in my
life.

3019
03:08:21,351 --> 03:08:30,677
MATT: That was the time to do it, man. So you guys
now see there is a long stone brick hallway before

3020
03:08:30,677 --> 03:08:36,597
you. It's solid behind you, with a little bit of
sand that's now coasted from the corner after Pike

3021
03:08:36,597 --> 03:08:43,893
had diverted it briefly. Beyond the way, about 30
feet ahead of you, you see two metallic doors that

3022
03:08:43,893 --> 03:08:45,035
are closed.

3023
03:08:45,035 --> 03:08:46,518
LIAM: Traps, I'm looking for traps.

3024
03:08:46,518 --> 03:08:47,794
MATT: Investigation check.

3025
03:08:47,794 --> 03:08:52,922
LIAM: Yeah, that's good. That is a 27.

3026
03:08:52,922 --> 03:08:57,404
MATT: You take a moment, scanning the floor as you
approach, coming up to the actual doors, you take

3027
03:08:57,404 --> 03:09:00,849
a minute to look them over. They are not locked,
nor are they trapped.

3028
03:09:00,849 --> 03:09:04,701
MARISHA: I never trust that. That's never been
good.

3029
03:09:04,701 --> 03:09:05,965
LIAM: I'm going stealth.

3030
03:09:05,965 --> 03:09:07,288
MATT: Okay.

3031
03:09:07,288 --> 03:09:11,019
LIAM: 30 for stealth.

3032
03:09:11,019 --> 03:09:16,799
MARISHA: What did that riddle say? Something about
a name. A name must be earned?

3033
03:09:16,799 --> 03:09:18,464
SAM: We're in a room with two doors? Is that it?

3034
03:09:18,464 --> 03:09:20,052
MATT: Correct, a hallway with two doors.

3035
03:09:20,052 --> 03:09:23,801
LAURA: A name is earned. Yes.

3036
03:09:23,801 --> 03:09:25,828
MARISHA: So maybe this is us earning our name.

3037
03:09:25,828 --> 03:09:27,079
LAURA: Or his name.

3038
03:09:27,079 --> 03:09:31,230
TRAVIS: Wait, so we went through water, we went
through sand.

3039
03:09:31,230 --> 03:09:35,188
LAURA: Now there's fire.

3040
03:09:35,188 --> 03:09:37,584
MARISHA: And wind.

3041
03:09:37,584 --> 03:09:39,410
SAM: We haven't gone through fire or wind yet.

3042
03:09:39,410 --> 03:09:45,060
LAURA: That was really smart, Grog.

3043
03:09:45,060 --> 03:09:50,139
LIAM: Deathwalker's Ward, I'll have resistance to
fire.

3044
03:09:50,139 --> 03:09:54,412
MATT: Okay, that would take a short rest to go
ahead and set that.

3045
03:09:54,412 --> 03:09:55,884
TRAVIS: I'm okay with that.

3046
03:09:55,884 --> 03:09:58,611
LIAM: Let's sit and let Grog catch a breath, shall
we?

3047
03:09:58,611 --> 03:10:01,787
MATT: Okay. You taking a short rest or no? Up to
you.

3048
03:10:01,787 --> 03:10:03,706
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll take it.

3049
03:10:03,706 --> 03:10:05,144
LAURA: Does it cure exhaustion if he takes a short
rest?

3050
03:10:05,144 --> 03:10:06,433
MATT: No, long rest cures exhaustion.

3051
03:10:06,433 --> 03:10:08,163
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck that shit, I'm rolling through.

3052
03:10:08,163 --> 03:10:11,380
MATT: (laughs) All right, you guys take a short
rest, you take a breather here, if you need to use

3053
03:10:11,380 --> 03:10:19,649
any hit dice, now you can. All right, so. Finish
the short rest, you've reset your armor to fire

3054
03:10:19,649 --> 03:10:20,961
resistance.

3055
03:10:20,961 --> 03:10:26,460
MARISHA: Is there any runes or anything around in
this room that look like they would indicate--

3056
03:10:26,460 --> 03:10:30,974
MATT: In the short rest, in the time you've taken,
while there were no traps in the door, you guys

3057
03:10:30,974 --> 03:10:37,647
did notice that there is a very, very faint symbol
in the metal. Very large, so at first it just

3058
03:10:37,647 --> 03:10:40,978
seemed like it was part of the door's design, but
as you step back and rest, you glance over at the

3059
03:10:40,978 --> 03:10:45,446
door, Keyleth, looking at it from this distance,
you can see the symbol--

3060
03:10:45,446 --> 03:10:47,967
TALIESIN: Ooh, he's got paper.

3061
03:10:47,967 --> 03:10:56,299
MATT: --like this. This is the symbol of Ioun.
This is the ancient original symbol of Ioun. This

3062
03:10:56,299 --> 03:11:00,665
is what is a relief in each of the doors, ever so
faintly, where only at a distance would you be

3063
03:11:00,665 --> 03:11:01,860
able to really see it.

3064
03:11:01,860 --> 03:11:03,679
SAM: Is it the exact same in both doors?

3065
03:11:03,679 --> 03:11:04,654
MATT: Yes.

3066
03:11:04,654 --> 03:11:06,790
SAM: Not a mirror image, not one blue one green?

3067
03:11:06,790 --> 03:11:08,229
MATT: No, it is the exact same.

3068
03:11:08,229 --> 03:11:10,570
SAM: Okay. Should we open a door?

3069
03:11:10,570 --> 03:11:13,279
MARISHA: Well, do you want to bust out those Ioun
stones you have?

3070
03:11:13,279 --> 03:11:15,914
SAM: Maybe there's a clue in here.

3071
03:11:15,914 --> 03:11:18,031
MARISHA: You also have your Ioun stones.

3072
03:11:18,031 --> 03:11:20,150
SAM: Yeah, but what's that going to do?

3073
03:11:20,150 --> 03:11:24,501
TRAVIS: In the walls and in the floors and in the
ceiling, is it just the same marble and stone, are

3074
03:11:24,501 --> 03:11:26,268
there any porous openings or--?

3075
03:11:26,268 --> 03:11:27,903
MATT: Make a perception check.

3076
03:11:27,903 --> 03:11:29,937
LAURA: What was that second line? "Knowledge dost
billow--"

3077
03:11:29,937 --> 03:11:35,573
SAM: "All realms are the shore. The sky is a
window, the water a door."

3078
03:11:35,573 --> 03:11:36,971
TRAVIS: 16.

3079
03:11:36,971 --> 03:11:41,097
MATT: Okay. Looking about, the stonework is pretty
consistent here. It's old, but unlike the

3080
03:11:41,097 --> 03:11:46,460
weathered entrance, a lot of this has not seen the
elements since it's fairly buried, and even at its

3081
03:11:46,460 --> 03:11:55,256
seemingly ancient time that it's been here, it
doesn't appear to be worn, looks fairly fresh. You

3082
03:11:55,256 --> 03:11:57,120
don't see any weaknesses, you don't see missing
stones.

3083
03:11:57,120 --> 03:11:58,415
TRAVIS: It's stone, though, right?

3084
03:11:58,415 --> 03:11:59,540
MATT: It is stone, yes.

3085
03:11:59,540 --> 03:12:00,772
TRAVIS: Like marble, or?

3086
03:12:00,772 --> 03:12:11,466
MATT: No, actually, this is more old, classic
granite or other deep-earth stones that are used

3087
03:12:11,466 --> 03:12:15,928
for various forms of construction. Doesn't have
any special properties that you can recognize.

3088
03:12:15,928 --> 03:12:19,057
TALIESIN: Well, if no one else is going to, I
think it'll be funny.

3089
03:12:19,057 --> 03:12:21,466
LIAM: Take 20 paces back.

3090
03:12:21,466 --> 03:12:22,810
SAM: And do what?

3091
03:12:22,810 --> 03:12:25,269
LIAM: And wait for me to open the door and look
in.

3092
03:12:25,269 --> 03:12:27,002
TALIESIN: Well, why don't I open the door and look
in?

3093
03:12:27,002 --> 03:12:30,542
LIAM: All right. I'm a little better at being
invisible, but go for it.

3094
03:12:30,542 --> 03:12:34,105
SAM: Which door?

3095
03:12:34,105 --> 03:12:35,984
TALIESIN: Both of them.

3096
03:12:35,984 --> 03:12:42,961
MATT: Both doors (creak) open. You look into what
appears to be a, from what you can see, because

3097
03:12:42,961 --> 03:12:48,354
there is a very, very faint bit of light emanating
from his dagger, but beyond that it is

3098
03:12:48,354 --> 03:12:54,117
pitch darkness. Percy is the one who cannot see.

3099
03:12:54,117 --> 03:12:55,843
TRAVIS: What do you see, Percy?

3100
03:12:55,843 --> 03:12:57,675
TALIESIN: I see a door that I have conquered.

3101
03:12:57,675 --> 03:13:01,972
(laughter)

3102
03:13:01,972 --> 03:13:06,982
TRAVIS: That was good.

3103
03:13:06,982 --> 03:13:10,856
LIAM: It was great. Do I need to make another
stealth check at this point?

3104
03:13:10,856 --> 03:13:12,707
MATT: Nah, it maintains.

3105
03:13:12,707 --> 03:13:14,583
LIAM: All right, so I'm going to--

3106
03:13:14,583 --> 03:13:21,834
Just stay back, there's no point in all of
us getting with something. And I move 20 feet

3107
03:13:21,834 --> 03:13:23,038
ahead of everybody.

3108
03:13:23,038 --> 03:13:28,987
MATT: You move 20 feet ahead. You enter the room
and you can see this chamber is square in size,

3109
03:13:28,987 --> 03:13:34,957
but it is divided, it seems to be in three halls.
There's a path to the right, a path to the left,

3110
03:13:34,957 --> 03:13:43,471
and a path ahead of you. You can't quite see all
the way past, the hallway continues to the very

3111
03:13:43,471 --> 03:13:48,912
edge of your visual range once you enter the
chamber. However, what you can see is to the right

3112
03:13:48,912 --> 03:13:53,197
and left of you parts of the wall have collapsed,
like there's piles of rubbles and stone and earth.

3113
03:13:53,197 --> 03:13:56,784
Make a perception check at this point.

3114
03:13:56,784 --> 03:13:59,095
LAURA: I'm peeking through the door at this
point.

3115
03:13:59,095 --> 03:14:00,876
MATT: Okay, she does as well.

3116
03:14:00,876 --> 03:14:05,857
LIAM: Going to use my second Luck today because I
rolled a one. That's better.

3117
03:14:05,857 --> 03:14:09,293
Perception, you said? 22.

3118
03:14:09,293 --> 03:14:16,346
MATT: Looking to the edge of the two pathways you
can see, there appears to be a little bit of a

3119
03:14:16,346 --> 03:14:25,092
shimmer or bit of movement, like light silk,
almost like threads shifting, entwined, it looks

3120
03:14:25,092 --> 03:14:31,126
almost like a large, very, very faint web that is
draped over one wall on the right and matching on

3121
03:14:31,126 --> 03:14:32,483
the left side.

3122
03:14:32,483 --> 03:14:35,054
LIAM: Does it remind me of anything I've seen in
my dreams?

3123
03:14:35,054 --> 03:14:40,162
MATT: I mean, other than the idea of a glimmering
thread, maybe, but it isn't glowing, it's not

3124
03:14:40,162 --> 03:14:45,629
emanating light, and it's very thin, very wispy.
And there are a few of them that you can see

3125
03:14:45,629 --> 03:14:50,779
before the rest of your perspective on the two
walls that break it into three passageways.

3126
03:14:50,779 --> 03:14:53,303
LIAM: I don't hear any eight-legged friends
around?

3127
03:14:53,303 --> 03:14:57,533
MATT: You don't see any currently at this
position. Ahead of you, in the central chamber,

3128
03:14:57,533 --> 03:15:02,552
you do see what looks to be a small pit, like a
divot. Almost like a cauldron, about ten feet

3129
03:15:02,552 --> 03:15:08,494
across. Similar in size and circular structure as
the first water pool you guys dove into, except

3130
03:15:08,494 --> 03:15:15,281
for it comes to a convex end with nothing visible
in it. There's like stones built around the

3131
03:15:15,281 --> 03:15:16,788
outside of it.

3132
03:15:16,788 --> 03:15:22,737
LIAM: I could be grasping at straws, but I'm
getting a bit of an arachnid vibe in here. I'm not

3133
03:15:22,737 --> 03:15:27,725
sure. There's three passages, there's webbing of
some kind to the left and to the right, and some

3134
03:15:27,725 --> 03:15:33,037
sort of divot or bowl on the ground. I think you
can all come in. Quietly.

3135
03:15:33,037 --> 03:15:37,243
LAURA: I walk up next to him. Oh yeah, I see what
you're talking about. Yeah.

3136
03:15:37,243 --> 03:15:41,312
MARISHA: Upon hearing this, Keyleth drops to her
knees and does a Locate Creature.

3137
03:15:41,312 --> 03:15:43,403
Do I sense any spiders?

3138
03:15:43,403 --> 03:15:46,482
MATT: You actually do not sense any spiders.

3139
03:15:46,482 --> 03:15:49,852
MARISHA: I think we're good on spiders.

3140
03:15:49,852 --> 03:15:54,293
TALIESIN: This thread is silk, isn't it? It's
actual material. I'm not going to touch it.

3141
03:15:54,293 --> 03:16:07,244
Conscious of the creation of air currents, I'm
going to gingerly put on my mask so that my breath

3142
03:16:07,244 --> 03:16:10,172
does not move things, and examine.

3143
03:16:10,172 --> 03:16:12,584
MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.

3144
03:16:12,584 --> 03:16:18,221
LAURA: Smart. While he's doing that, I want to use
Primeval Awareness to sense celestials.

3145
03:16:18,221 --> 03:16:23,841
MATT: And that is one of the entities that you can
check with that? Okay. What'd you roll, Taliesin?

3146
03:16:23,841 --> 03:16:29,106
TALIESIN: I rolled a two. So my investigation is
five. Which is how old I'm turning.

3147
03:16:29,106 --> 03:16:32,471
(laughter)

3148
03:16:32,471 --> 03:16:36,019
MATT: It is a thread and there are multiple-- as
you get closer, you can see there are many threads

3149
03:16:36,019 --> 03:16:44,109
that are partway through this 15, 20-foot wide
hallway on the far right that you've gone to and

3150
03:16:44,109 --> 03:16:50,845
inspected. This network of threads appear to be
attaching at the halfway point and then draped

3151
03:16:50,845 --> 03:16:57,291
against the wall, what looks like a spiderweb made
of this thread all converges in the center. That's

3152
03:16:57,291 --> 03:17:02,405
the best you can make of it. You do not sense any
celestials.

3153
03:17:02,405 --> 03:17:04,332
TRAVIS: The hell's a celestial?

3154
03:17:04,332 --> 03:17:07,190
MATT: But do mark off your spell slot for that
use.

3155
03:17:07,190 --> 03:17:15,697
LAURA: That's not a spell slot, it's just my-- Oh!
Expend one ranger spell slot! I have never, ever

3156
03:17:15,697 --> 03:17:16,775
done that.

3157
03:17:16,775 --> 03:17:18,144
MATT: I assumed you were keeping track of that.

3158
03:17:18,144 --> 03:17:19,806
LAURA: I have never even looked at that bold--

3159
03:17:19,806 --> 03:17:21,352
MATT: Well, going forward--

3160
03:17:21,352 --> 03:17:23,557
TRAVIS: It is in bold print.

3161
03:17:23,557 --> 03:17:26,376
LAURA: Wow. I am sorry about that, Matt.

3162
03:17:26,376 --> 03:17:27,455
MATT: That's okay.

3163
03:17:27,455 --> 03:17:30,007
SAM: Is there any way to cross the room without
touching the web?

3164
03:17:30,007 --> 03:17:35,308
MATT: Yeah. Essentially, it's a 15, 20-foot wide
thing, the web only starts about partway and

3165
03:17:35,308 --> 03:17:36,995
encompasses the side of it.

3166
03:17:36,995 --> 03:17:40,917
MARISHA: And is there anything behind the webs?
Just rubble?

3167
03:17:40,917 --> 03:17:45,625
MATT: Behind the webs, the hallway continues and
then ends and then continues right. It's almost

3168
03:17:45,625 --> 03:17:51,735
like it's a square room that has walls here that
split it into three different passages and they

3169
03:17:51,735 --> 03:17:53,828
all converge again on the opposite side.

3170
03:17:53,828 --> 03:17:57,072
LAURA: Can we see all the way to the end?

3171
03:17:57,072 --> 03:17:58,827
MATT: Make a perception check.

3172
03:17:58,827 --> 03:18:00,524
TALIESIN: It's very mini-golf.

3173
03:18:00,524 --> 03:18:05,429
LAURA: 16.

3174
03:18:05,429 --> 03:18:10,838
MATT: 16? You notice at the end of the two
hallways on the sides, beyond the spiderweb in the

3175
03:18:10,838 --> 03:18:19,394
corner, there are two small five, six-foot-wide
pools of water similar to the ones you dove into

3176
03:18:19,394 --> 03:18:24,455
that are lined with stones and a little bit of
gold trim similar to what you guys saw in the

3177
03:18:24,455 --> 03:18:25,953
previous room.

3178
03:18:25,953 --> 03:18:27,047
LAURA: Those doorways?

3179
03:18:27,047 --> 03:18:31,103
MATT: So you have the rubble's on the side, you
have the spiderwebs, you have the pools at the end

3180
03:18:31,103 --> 03:18:35,493
there, and you have the empty cauldron in the
center piece, but you cannot see, unless you move

3181
03:18:35,493 --> 03:18:39,320
further forward, you cannot see beyond where those
hallways converge on the opposite side.

3182
03:18:39,320 --> 03:18:42,311
TRAVIS: Is it just me, or does that one in the
middle look like a fire pit?

3183
03:18:42,311 --> 03:18:46,837
MARISHA: I agree. I think this looks like a
convergence-of-the-elements type of a room.

3184
03:18:46,837 --> 03:18:49,452
TRAVIS: We have some boar in the frozen bag.

3185
03:18:49,452 --> 03:18:51,188
SAM: You want to start cooking here?

3186
03:18:51,188 --> 03:18:53,772
MARISHA: I can light a fire in that pit.

3187
03:18:53,772 --> 03:19:00,819
LAURA: Is it far away? You can set my arrow on
fire and send it down.

3188
03:19:00,819 --> 03:19:03,885
MATT: Nah. It's 25 feet from the doors you guys
entered in

3189
03:19:03,885 --> 03:19:05,840
LAURA: Oh. Just don't want to walk down there.

3190
03:19:05,840 --> 03:19:10,713
TRAVIS: The last time we did that, shit went
down.

3191
03:19:10,713 --> 03:19:14,800
LAURA: Let's get in the doorway and then if
something happens we shut the doors.

3192
03:19:14,800 --> 03:19:18,214
TRAVIS: Well, can we walk over to the cauldron
first and see what's above it?

3193
03:19:18,214 --> 03:19:20,268
LAURA: If you want to walk in.

3194
03:19:20,268 --> 03:19:24,132
MATT: Vax. Okay, as you walk up, make a perception
check.

3195
03:19:24,132 --> 03:19:28,290
LIAM: 23.

3196
03:19:28,290 --> 03:19:31,704
MATT: As they're having this conversation, looking
about and floating back, I know your passive as

3197
03:19:31,704 --> 03:19:38,302
well, but even mid-conversation with him, as you
kept an eye out, you see too that to the front of

3198
03:19:38,302 --> 03:19:44,213
each of these walls that bisects the room, what
you thought was just a wall, now as you've had

3199
03:19:44,213 --> 03:19:47,845
time to study it in quiet as everybody else has
been talking during these experiments-- Scanlan,

3200
03:19:47,845 --> 03:19:55,479
you probably would've noticed this too-- the wall
is, the separator's actually a giant obelisk on

3201
03:19:55,479 --> 03:20:02,014
each side, just like the one that you saw in the
Frostweald on the way in that the basilisks were

3202
03:20:02,014 --> 03:20:07,556
around. You see they're much newer, they're not as
weathered by the ages, and they're these two

3203
03:20:07,556 --> 03:20:11,076
markers with the symbol of Ioun carved into them.

3204
03:20:11,076 --> 03:20:12,831
LIAM: Shorthalt, come here.

3205
03:20:12,831 --> 03:20:14,136
SAM: Oi? Oi, yes.

3206
03:20:14,136 --> 03:20:17,641
LIAM: Look at this thing. Look there and there.
These are like the--

3207
03:20:17,641 --> 03:20:19,512
SAM: It's like the one that we saw before.

3208
03:20:19,512 --> 03:20:20,807
LIAM: Yeah, do you still have the doohickus?

3209
03:20:20,807 --> 03:20:22,147
SAM: Of course I have my doohickus.

3210
03:20:22,147 --> 03:20:23,877
LIAM: Do you want us to shove it in the hole?

3211
03:20:23,877 --> 03:20:27,838
SAM: You realize that I was born to shove things
in holes.

3212
03:20:27,838 --> 03:20:30,456
LIAM: That's why I called you over, man.

3213
03:20:30,456 --> 03:20:32,471
SAM: All right, so which one?

3214
03:20:32,471 --> 03:20:41,491
LIAM: Eenie, meenie, miney, mo. Catch a druid by
the toe. If she hollers, let her go, eenie,

3215
03:20:41,491 --> 03:20:43,220
meenie, miney--

3216
03:20:43,220 --> 03:20:46,480
MARISHA: You know, we've always found that very
offensive. I just want to say that.

3217
03:20:46,480 --> 03:20:50,439
SAM: I'll choose the right one and I'll stick my
Ioun stone in it.

3218
03:20:50,439 --> 03:20:55,366
MATT: Okay, looking at the base of it, you see
there is the same triangular symbol there. You

3219
03:20:55,366 --> 03:21:01,527
place the Ioun stone into the recess in the
obelisk. As you do, it glows faintly, the obelisk

3220
03:21:01,527 --> 03:21:08,075
itself tends to give off the same teal,
greenish-blue glow, the other one also does the

3221
03:21:08,075 --> 03:21:17,326
same. At which point the darkness across the room
is immediately dissipated as two previously unseen

3222
03:21:17,326 --> 03:21:24,744
braziers across the way burst into flame, lighting
the opposite side of the room. You can see what

3223
03:21:24,744 --> 03:21:30,472
looks to be a series of heavy steps that lead up
to a higher platform on the opposite side of the

3224
03:21:30,472 --> 03:21:35,079
room. You can see two pillars at the edge on the
very top of this raised platform

3225
03:21:35,079 --> 03:21:37,335
that meet the ceiling.

3226
03:21:37,335 --> 03:21:42,171
SAM: Well, let's go up there and check it out.

3227
03:21:42,171 --> 03:21:43,558
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

3228
03:21:43,558 --> 03:21:45,341
TRAVIS: I like it. You want a hand?

3229
03:21:45,341 --> 03:21:47,110
LIAM: I push Scanlan a bit up ahead of me.

3230
03:21:47,110 --> 03:21:50,991
MARISHA: So this is going over the firepit, past
the wispy--

3231
03:21:50,991 --> 03:21:56,943
MATT: Yeah, there's all the stuff on the sides and
the central room has that pit.

3232
03:21:56,943 --> 03:21:59,428
LAURA: Hold your breath as you pass the wispy
wisps, I don't trust them.

3233
03:21:59,428 --> 03:22:02,226
LIAM: Get that silver tongue of yours ready, all
right?

3234
03:22:02,226 --> 03:22:05,820
SAM: I don't think anything's going to want to
talk to us down here.

3235
03:22:05,820 --> 03:22:10,976
TRAVIS: Can we look at the ground for (laughs) for
traps as we're walking?

3236
03:22:10,976 --> 03:22:14,044
Any squares that might move?

3237
03:22:14,044 --> 03:22:16,235
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3238
03:22:16,235 --> 03:22:19,819
TRAVIS: Yup. Nine.

3239
03:22:19,819 --> 03:22:23,358
MATT: Nothing catches your attention.

3240
03:22:23,358 --> 03:22:24,754
TRAVIS: No, we're good.

3241
03:22:24,754 --> 03:22:25,962
LIAM: Would you like me to do that?

3242
03:22:25,962 --> 03:22:30,045
MATT: Are you guys all moving in the different
ways, the same way? Which way are you taking?

3243
03:22:30,045 --> 03:22:36,868
SAM: If we go to the right or the left, we have to
cross these webs? Or no?

3244
03:22:36,868 --> 03:22:40,871
MATT: You can move around the web on that, it only
covers half the path, you still have about seven

3245
03:22:40,871 --> 03:22:44,007
to ten feet of clearance between where the web
starts and the wall.

3246
03:22:44,007 --> 03:22:47,369
LAURA: Just open with a brazier at the end.

3247
03:22:47,369 --> 03:22:48,652
MATT: Mm-hmm.

3248
03:22:48,652 --> 03:22:51,282
SAM: Why don't we each take a direction?

3249
03:22:51,282 --> 03:22:52,605
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll take the left.

3250
03:22:52,605 --> 03:22:53,606
LAURA: I'll take the middle.

3251
03:22:53,606 --> 03:22:54,873
TALIESIN: I'll take the right.

3252
03:22:54,873 --> 03:22:59,382
MATT: Okay. You guys all quietly move forward,
stepping through these passages, stepping around,

3253
03:22:59,382 --> 03:23:03,438
you can see, like I said, the crumbled walls in
the far corner, you can see the webbing there,

3254
03:23:03,438 --> 03:23:07,719
there are the small pools at the far end corners
before they converge again into the central

3255
03:23:07,719 --> 03:23:09,798
chamber where that giant platform is.

3256
03:23:09,798 --> 03:23:13,676
TALIESIN: I have my gun in my hand, by the way.
And my mask on.

3257
03:23:13,676 --> 03:23:16,521
SAM: Wait, I could just bamf over to the other
side. Should I just do that?

3258
03:23:16,521 --> 03:23:17,980
LAURA: Maybe you should do that.

3259
03:23:17,980 --> 03:23:20,220
MATT: You guys are partway across now. Are you
stopping?

3260
03:23:20,220 --> 03:23:21,316
MARISHA: No.

3261
03:23:21,316 --> 03:23:28,089
TALIESIN: I'm going to continue not disturbing the
air as best I can.

3262
03:23:28,089 --> 03:23:30,726
MARISHA: Yeah, we're moving very slowly, not
disturbing the air.

3263
03:23:30,726 --> 03:23:32,672
MATT: Okay, you guys keep walking carefully.
Scanlan, are you doing anything?

3264
03:23:32,672 --> 03:23:35,795
SAM: Yeah, I'll Dimension Door to the platform on
the other side.

3265
03:23:35,795 --> 03:23:41,308
MATT: Okay. You appear on the opposite side and
you look around. What you didn't see from the

3266
03:23:41,308 --> 03:23:48,618
shadow that was being cast past the braziers, to
the right of you, Scanlan, you see a large form

3267
03:23:48,618 --> 03:23:57,050
that is there, as a pile, a crumpled pile on the
top of this platform. What catches your eyes, and

3268
03:23:57,050 --> 03:24:02,227
you guys see this too as you begin to walk up as
Scanlan appears and glances over, as you get

3269
03:24:02,227 --> 03:24:16,653
closer you can see there is what looks to be a
cold, blue marble that is right there, and you see

3270
03:24:16,653 --> 03:24:25,681
it being turned and held by what looks to be a
very faintly lit giant paw. You can see two eyes

3271
03:24:25,681 --> 03:24:30,665
that glance up, and glance over at Scanlan amongst
the shadows, the same color as that blue marble.

3272
03:24:30,665 --> 03:24:38,163
As it glances at Scanlan, and it is massive in
comparison to your tiny gnomish frame, the marble

3273
03:24:38,163 --> 03:24:42,617
is then tucked deep into what looks like hair of
some kind before it disappears, the eyes still

3274
03:24:42,617 --> 03:24:51,886
glowing the blue color. Suddenly the form begins
to move as two giant arms (impacts), and a voice comes

3275
03:24:51,886 --> 03:25:02,758
billowing out of this entity. "I have watched you
come." The creature now stands on all fours. A

3276
03:25:02,758 --> 03:25:11,666
good 15, 20 feet taller than you, Scanlan. A body
similar and lionlike to Osysa's, only thicker and

3277
03:25:11,666 --> 03:25:17,671
rippling with muscle beneath the fur. The face is
masculine and human-like, cheeks adorned with

3278
03:25:17,671 --> 03:25:24,092
ceremonial marks, head wreathed in a thick mane of
red-brown hair. Two enormous feathered wings

3279
03:25:24,092 --> 03:25:31,332
stretch out from its back, with a giant whoosh, a
whoosh of wind that tends to cause the braziers to

3280
03:25:31,332 --> 03:25:41,305
shift in place. And it looks at you for a second,
expectantly, then to the rest of the others.

3281
03:25:41,305 --> 03:25:48,037
SAM: Hello. Osysa sent us.

3282
03:25:48,037 --> 03:25:55,834
MATT: It mounts itself there, turns so it's facing
both you and the rest of you as you all approach.

3283
03:25:55,834 --> 03:26:15,020
"You, you seek power, glory, retribution. I know
your quarry, and I know your goal. She has told

3284
03:26:15,020 --> 03:26:30,312
"me. I can show you. But all great knowledge should
not be given. You must be proven. It must be

3285
03:26:30,312 --> 03:26:41,642
"earned. It must be EARNED." And as his voice
roars, the room echoes and you can see wind begin

3286
03:26:41,642 --> 03:26:43,273
to whip all around you.

3287
03:26:43,273 --> 03:26:50,255
Glancing over your shoulder, you guys can see now
the empty pit in the center of the hall behind you

3288
03:26:50,255 --> 03:26:56,434
is now whipping into a whirlwind and what appears
to be a small centralized cyclone that's now

3289
03:26:56,434 --> 03:27:04,082
rising up, meeting the ceiling, staying stationary
in place, arcing there. The braziers flame up even

3290
03:27:04,082 --> 03:27:09,716
brighter now, the flames, you can feel the heat
even from your distance at this point. You can see

3291
03:27:09,716 --> 03:27:19,554
now the sphinx is baring its gleaming white teeth
there at the top. "What. Is. My. Name?"

3292
03:27:19,554 --> 03:27:20,555
SAM: Fuck.

3293
03:27:20,555 --> 03:27:22,406
MATT: Roll initiative.

3294
03:27:22,406 --> 03:27:24,151
MARISHA: We have no fucking clue!

3295
03:27:24,151 --> 03:27:25,594
LAURA: Oh my god!

3296
03:27:25,594 --> 03:27:31,871
TALIESIN: Okay, that just happened.

3297
03:27:31,871 --> 03:27:33,787
LAURA: His name, what is his name?

3298
03:27:33,787 --> 03:27:36,035
TALIESIN: I'm back, baby.

3299
03:27:36,035 --> 03:27:38,580
MARISHA: The golden snitch lives!

3300
03:27:38,580 --> 03:27:46,982
MATT: All righty.

3301
03:27:46,982 --> 03:27:52,903
MARISHA: I have the worst initiative rolls all the
time except for earlier today.

3302
03:27:52,903 --> 03:28:11,147
MATT: All righty. So. Initiative roll. Ooh. Okay.
All righty. So. 25 to 20.

3303
03:28:11,147 --> 03:28:12,550
LIAM: 24.

3304
03:28:12,550 --> 03:28:13,960
TALIESIN: 30.

3305
03:28:13,960 --> 03:28:15,659
MATT: (laughs) Damn.

3306
03:28:15,659 --> 03:28:18,001
LAURA: Jeez Louise.

3307
03:28:18,001 --> 03:28:21,171
MATT: All right.

3308
03:28:21,171 --> 03:28:23,000
LAURA: Any ideas?

3309
03:28:23,000 --> 03:28:26,682
TALIESIN: Very, I, yes? Maybe? I don't know?

3310
03:28:26,682 --> 03:28:28,298
MATT: 20 to 15?

3311
03:28:28,298 --> 03:28:29,332
LAURA: 19.

3312
03:28:29,332 --> 03:28:30,281
MATT: 19.

3313
03:28:30,281 --> 03:28:31,521
SAM: 17.

3314
03:28:31,521 --> 03:28:35,075
MATT: All right.

3315
03:28:35,075 --> 03:28:36,532
LAURA: That map is awesome.

3316
03:28:36,532 --> 03:28:40,131
TRAVIS: All the elements are there.

3317
03:28:40,131 --> 03:28:43,333
LIAM: Look at the fire. (laughs)

3318
03:28:43,333 --> 03:28:45,477
MATT: Oh yeah, we got flickering braziers, guys.

3319
03:28:45,477 --> 03:28:48,743
SAM: Whoa, that's lit, it's lit up! How did you do
that?

3320
03:28:48,743 --> 03:28:54,096
MATT: Dwarven Forge has cool stuff. Thank you
guys.

3321
03:28:54,096 --> 03:28:55,412
TRAVIS: Fucking Dwarven Forge, man.

3322
03:28:55,412 --> 03:28:57,546
MATT: All right, so that brings us to 15 to ten?

3323
03:28:57,546 --> 03:28:58,775
TRAVIS: 14.

3324
03:28:58,775 --> 03:29:01,457
MATT: Grog. Anyone else?

3325
03:29:01,457 --> 03:29:02,776
MARISHA: Seven.

3326
03:29:02,776 --> 03:29:12,883
MATT: Oh, and Pike is actually before Grog. All
right. Percy, you're up first.

3327
03:29:12,883 --> 03:29:16,166
SAM: He hasn't attacked us.

3328
03:29:16,166 --> 03:29:20,036
MARISHA: What is his name, Percy?

3329
03:29:20,036 --> 03:29:21,899
SAM: Atreyu.

3330
03:29:21,899 --> 03:29:34,219
TALIESIN: I hate you. I'm going to pull back to
the water pit to my right. Oh, to my left, sorry.

3331
03:29:34,219 --> 03:29:37,933
I'm going to pull back to that water pit. I'm
going to examine it.

3332
03:29:37,933 --> 03:29:40,269
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3333
03:29:40,269 --> 03:29:47,747
TALIESIN: 21.

3334
03:29:47,747 --> 03:30:01,553
MATT: 21. As you rush over, you look down into the
pool. The surface itself is disturbed by the wind

3335
03:30:01,553 --> 03:30:08,611
that's blowing in this chamber. However, looking
into it, below the surface you don't see-- it's

3336
03:30:08,611 --> 03:30:13,412
darkness, you don't see a continuation, you don't
see anything behind it.

3337
03:30:13,412 --> 03:30:16,205
The water doesn't seem natural.

3338
03:30:16,205 --> 03:30:30,106
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to scoop some of the
water with my mask, pull the mask off, scoop

3339
03:30:30,106 --> 03:30:36,044
water, and try and toss it at the flame that's
right next to me. That's my move.

3340
03:30:36,044 --> 03:30:41,175
MATT: Okay. You put the mask in and your hand
moves into it. Your hand gets extremely cold

3341
03:30:41,175 --> 03:30:47,750
suddenly. You don't see it beneath the surface; it
almost vanishes below the water. It's really

3342
03:30:47,750 --> 03:30:51,547
unsettling. You pull it up and the water is there
in your mask. You throw it and the water, it

3343
03:30:51,547 --> 03:30:56,517
evaporates and the flames flicker slightly, but
they's too strong and it doesn't seem to have much

3344
03:30:56,517 --> 03:30:59,010
of an effect on the brazier.

3345
03:30:59,010 --> 03:31:00,977
TALIESIN: Fascinating. All right. That's my move.

3346
03:31:00,977 --> 03:31:04,371
MATT: Yep. That's your move and your action. All
right, that ends Percy's turn. Vax, you're up.

3347
03:31:04,371 --> 03:31:08,102
LIAM: How are we supposed to know your name? Is it
Osyso?

3348
03:31:08,102 --> 03:31:13,559
MATT: Teeth are bared and it's sitting there
looking at all of you, waiting.

3349
03:31:13,559 --> 03:31:21,674
LIAM: I'm going to click my Boots of Haste. Can I
use a bonus action to hide and then hold?

3350
03:31:21,674 --> 03:31:25,375
Any stuff?

3351
03:31:25,375 --> 03:31:29,650
MATT: You could, yeah, you can move and then hold
your action to a trigger point if you want to.

3352
03:31:29,650 --> 03:31:30,914
LIAM: Where am I in there?

3353
03:31:30,914 --> 03:31:32,155
MATT: You're right here.

3354
03:31:32,155 --> 03:31:35,475
LIAM: So I'm going to hide. I'm going to move
backward around the corner and hide.

3355
03:31:35,475 --> 03:31:36,854
MATT: Around this way?

3356
03:31:36,854 --> 03:31:38,020
LIAM: Yeah.

3357
03:31:38,020 --> 03:31:40,751
MATT: Okay, you can move there. Go ahead and roll
for hide.

3358
03:31:40,751 --> 03:31:42,448
LIAM: Okay. 25.

3359
03:31:42,448 --> 03:31:44,852
MATT: Okay.

3360
03:31:44,852 --> 03:31:50,188
LIAM: And I'm going to hold for the moment he
attacks any of my friends.

3361
03:31:50,188 --> 03:31:59,219
MATT: Okay, got you. All right, at the end of your
turn, the entire-- the wind that's blowing, there's

3362
03:31:59,219 --> 03:32:03,593
grains of sand that are picked up into it,
and you guys feel like there's something out of

3363
03:32:03,593 --> 03:32:10,532
place, this whole area, like this sudden drift.
You feel like the air in your lungs gets

3364
03:32:10,532 --> 03:32:13,842
butterflies for a second and something, even
though this place is stationary, it's almost like

3365
03:32:13,842 --> 03:32:17,448
the whole place shifts. I need everybody to make a
constitution saving throw.

3366
03:32:17,448 --> 03:32:18,578
LIAM: Shit.

3367
03:32:18,578 --> 03:32:20,855
TRAVIS: Fuck.

3368
03:32:20,855 --> 03:32:22,145
TALIESIN: Damn, I'm back.

3369
03:32:22,145 --> 03:32:24,127
MARISHA: Nice.

3370
03:32:24,127 --> 03:32:26,236
TALIESIN: 26.

3371
03:32:26,236 --> 03:32:27,488
SAM: Four.

3372
03:32:27,488 --> 03:32:30,111
MARISHA: Saving throw, correct?

3373
03:32:30,111 --> 03:32:32,056
MATT: Yes, constitution saving throw.

3374
03:32:32,056 --> 03:32:33,866
MARISHA: 23. 22.

3375
03:32:33,866 --> 03:32:35,002
LIAM: 17.

3376
03:32:35,002 --> 03:32:37,408
TRAVIS: With disadvantage, 13.

3377
03:32:37,408 --> 03:32:50,604
MATT: Okay. While most of you guys manage to
withstand it, Scanlan and Grog and Vex, the wind

3378
03:32:50,604 --> 03:32:54,327
feels like it's knocked out of you, and like you
were suddenly stretched thin and you can't

3379
03:32:54,327 --> 03:33:03,086
understand it. You glance-- right now, it's hard to
really tell. Scanlan lurches forward for a second.

3380
03:33:03,086 --> 03:33:07,248
Grog and Vex, you're right next to each other, you
both glance at each other and you can see, it's

3381
03:33:07,248 --> 03:33:16,917
like Grog's skin has aged suddenly. His-- around
his eyes it's grown a little more sunken, his

3382
03:33:16,917 --> 03:33:21,508
muscles have sagged slightly. He looks, not
ancient by any means, but it looks like he's seen

3383
03:33:21,508 --> 03:33:25,173
about another 15 to 20 years of travels.

3384
03:33:25,173 --> 03:33:27,150
TALIESIN: Oh shit.

3385
03:33:27,150 --> 03:33:28,389
TRAVIS: What does that mean?

3386
03:33:28,389 --> 03:33:29,605
SAM: Me too?

3387
03:33:29,605 --> 03:33:36,125
MATT: You also have, although due to your gnome
lineage it has less of an effect, and no one's

3388
03:33:36,125 --> 03:33:40,934
noticed it at this distance, but if anyone gets a
quick glance, you'll see a few grey hairs starting

3389
03:33:40,934 --> 03:33:42,973
to sprout on the side of Scanlan's head.

3390
03:33:42,973 --> 03:33:44,611
SAM: I get rid of those.

3391
03:33:44,611 --> 03:33:46,480
MATT: All right. Vex, you're up.

3392
03:33:46,480 --> 03:33:48,822
LAURA: Oh. Do I feel old?

3393
03:33:48,822 --> 03:33:54,053
MATT: You feel like you've been pulled through
something, but it doesn't have a mighty effect,

3394
03:33:54,053 --> 03:34:00,045
although, Grog, glancing at Vex you can see there
is definitely a little bit more of a weathered

3395
03:34:00,045 --> 03:34:04,770
look to her, crow's nests forming, deep-seated
frown lines.

3396
03:34:04,770 --> 03:34:12,459
LAURA: Oh, jeez. I shout out-- I run towards the
other water portal.

3397
03:34:12,459 --> 03:34:13,753
MATT: Okay.

3398
03:34:13,753 --> 03:34:25,361
LAURA: And I shout out, Pike, do you know the
names of the four ancient gods? Is your name four?

3399
03:34:25,361 --> 03:34:27,198
That's stupid.

3400
03:34:27,198 --> 03:34:35,255
MATT: There doesn't seem to be a reaction. Pike
goes, "No, I mean, the gods that were at the

3401
03:34:35,255 --> 03:34:36,576
"beginning, there's--"

3402
03:34:36,576 --> 03:34:37,780
LAURA: Yeah?

3403
03:34:37,780 --> 03:34:46,325
MATT: "There was Pelor and Melora and, I mean,
they're the ones who cast away the elements, the

3404
03:34:46,325 --> 03:34:54,223
"chaos that this realm was first. I don't know!"
And she seems-- she's bungled and unable to really

3405
03:34:54,223 --> 03:34:56,054
formulate what you're asking.

3406
03:34:56,054 --> 03:35:01,571
LAURA: I wouldn't have any religion, anything to
base that off of?

3407
03:35:01,571 --> 03:35:06,125
MATT: Make a religion check if you want to.

3408
03:35:06,125 --> 03:35:10,997
LAURA: Wow. Wow. Two! That's four ones in a
night.

3409
03:35:10,997 --> 03:35:14,333
MATT: Wow. Wow. It's the reverse Percy tonight.

3410
03:35:14,333 --> 03:35:17,946
LAURA: I've been cursed.

3411
03:35:17,946 --> 03:35:24,247
MATT: You try and think back to the conversation
you had with Highbearer Vord in

3412
03:35:24,247 --> 03:35:27,932
the Platinum Sanctuary, and your mind's a blank.
You can't recall any of that conversation.

3413
03:35:27,932 --> 03:35:31,078
LAURA: I have an advantage on anything having to
do with dragons.

3414
03:35:31,078 --> 03:35:32,659
MATT: It has nothing to do with dragons.

3415
03:35:32,659 --> 03:35:33,758
LAURA: Well, I was just checking.

3416
03:35:33,758 --> 03:35:37,338
MATT: This is the creation myth of all of
existence. However, you still have your action if

3417
03:35:37,338 --> 03:35:40,688
you want to do something. You're by the pool, it's
right to your right, and there's

3418
03:35:40,688 --> 03:35:42,317
this sphinx now rearing--

3419
03:35:42,317 --> 03:35:46,756
LAURA: I saw Percy dip his hand into the water, so
I do the same thing to see what it does.

3420
03:35:46,756 --> 03:35:48,069
MATT: You what? You put your--

3421
03:35:48,069 --> 03:35:49,595
LAURA: I put my hand in the water.

3422
03:35:49,595 --> 03:35:52,447
MATT: You dip your hand in the water. The hand,
once it breaks the surface, it vanishes into

3423
03:35:52,447 --> 03:35:57,089
darkness below the water. You don't even see,
there's no visual on it.

3424
03:35:57,089 --> 03:35:58,257
LAURA: Does it hurt?

3425
03:35:58,257 --> 03:35:59,883
MATT: No, it doesn't hurt, it's cold, it's very
cold.

3426
03:35:59,883 --> 03:36:02,075
LAURA: Pull it back out.

3427
03:36:02,075 --> 03:36:05,717
MATT: Pull it back out. Your hand is wet and it
drips and you shake it free.

3428
03:36:05,717 --> 03:36:09,803
LAURA: Can I use a bonus action to try to hide? Is
there anywhere to hide? Maybe against a wall or

3429
03:36:09,803 --> 03:36:11,068
something?

3430
03:36:11,068 --> 03:36:18,046
MATT: You move one, two, three, four, five, six.
You're not going to be able to get completely out

3431
03:36:18,046 --> 03:36:21,878
of sight. (laughs) Unless you want to jump in the
water.

3432
03:36:21,878 --> 03:36:26,235
TALIESIN: So there's a whirlwind in the center of
the room, there's two piles of rocks, there's two

3433
03:36:26,235 --> 03:36:30,113
vats of water, there's two torches, and then
there's two spiderwebs.

3434
03:36:30,113 --> 03:36:31,545
MATT: Correct.

3435
03:36:31,545 --> 03:36:33,893
TALIESIN: And the spiderwebs are covering the
walls.

3436
03:36:33,893 --> 03:36:44,793
MATT: Yeah. All right, so that ends Vex's turn.
Scanlan, you're up.

3437
03:36:44,793 --> 03:36:57,173
SAM: I will face the sphinx and say: is your name
Ioun?

3438
03:36:57,173 --> 03:37:12,662
MATT: The sphinx is still there growling at you.
"She is beyond me... What is my name, little

3439
03:37:12,662 --> 03:37:14,196
"scrumptious one?"

3440
03:37:14,196 --> 03:37:16,149
TRAVIS: Hit him!

3441
03:37:16,149 --> 03:37:18,469
TALIESIN: Do you have your earpiece in, by the
way?

3442
03:37:18,469 --> 03:37:19,623
SAM: Sure, we all do.

3443
03:37:19,623 --> 03:37:21,149
TALIESIN: Okay. Good to know.

3444
03:37:21,149 --> 03:37:28,398
SAM: I mean, I'm not going to attack this thing if
it hasn't attacked me yet, so I'm going to, eee.

3445
03:37:28,398 --> 03:37:30,995
TRAVIS: There's spiderwebs, there's stones,
there's fire, there's water--

3446
03:37:30,995 --> 03:37:32,601
TALIESIN: Working on it!

3447
03:37:32,601 --> 03:37:39,622
LAURA: I feel like we're so stupid, we should know
this. "The four endure, the four remember."

3448
03:37:39,622 --> 03:37:45,786
SAM: Can I hold my attack until a trigger?

3449
03:37:45,786 --> 03:37:48,305
MATT: You can if you want to, yeah.

3450
03:37:48,305 --> 03:37:50,012
SAM: Or hold my action until a trigger?

3451
03:37:50,012 --> 03:37:51,503
MATT: Yeah, what do you want to hold it for?

3452
03:37:51,503 --> 03:37:55,673
SAM: If he makes a move towards me physically.

3453
03:37:55,673 --> 03:37:57,769
MATT: Okay.

3454
03:37:57,769 --> 03:38:01,732
Remember, you guys who are holding your
action, you can interrupt and release at anything

3455
03:38:01,732 --> 03:38:07,003
if it doesn't happen, be aware of that. All
right, so it now goes to the sphinx's turn.

3456
03:38:07,003 --> 03:38:12,611
TRAVIS: Okay, this should be fun. We're all
standing around with our thumbs up our asses.

3457
03:38:12,611 --> 03:38:14,972
LIAM: Yup.

3458
03:38:14,972 --> 03:38:22,569
MATT: The sphinx takes a step forward to the edge
of the stairway and (roars) gives out this

3459
03:38:22,569 --> 03:38:28,624
earth-shattering roar that shakes-- a couple of
stones and dust that are loosened from the ceiling

3460
03:38:28,624 --> 03:38:33,089
falls down. I need everybody to make a wisdom
saving throw.

3461
03:38:33,089 --> 03:38:35,934
SAM: Is this magic?

3462
03:38:35,934 --> 03:38:38,438
MATT: Yes, it is.

3463
03:38:38,438 --> 03:38:40,667
LIAM: Is it charm, by any chance?

3464
03:38:40,667 --> 03:38:42,522
MATT: It's not a spell, it is a magical effect.

3465
03:38:42,522 --> 03:38:44,290
SAM: Do I get advantage on that?

3466
03:38:44,290 --> 03:38:46,207
MATT: What do you get advantage from?

3467
03:38:46,207 --> 03:38:49,449
SAM: Advantage versus magic on saves.

3468
03:38:49,449 --> 03:38:51,436
MATT: From being a gnome?

3469
03:38:51,436 --> 03:38:59,225
SAM: It says, Gnome Cunning, advantage on wisdom,
character, intelligence, magic saves. That's what

3470
03:38:59,225 --> 03:39:00,718
I wrote down, anyway.

3471
03:39:00,718 --> 03:39:02,701
MATT: Let me double-check here just to be sure.

3472
03:39:02,701 --> 03:39:05,923
SAM: It doesn't really matter, I rolled shit on
both, so it's okay. Don't bother.

3473
03:39:05,923 --> 03:39:09,418
MATT: (laughs) Okay. Against magic, so yeah, you
would have advantage.

3474
03:39:09,418 --> 03:39:11,192
LIAM: And does it have anything to do with charm
or sleep?

3475
03:39:11,192 --> 03:39:12,405
MATT: Nope.

3476
03:39:12,405 --> 03:39:13,726
LIAM: Nope, okay. 17.

3477
03:39:13,726 --> 03:39:14,643
MATT: 17.

3478
03:39:14,643 --> 03:39:16,270
SAM: Seven.

3479
03:39:16,270 --> 03:39:17,251
TALIESIN: 19.

3480
03:39:17,251 --> 03:39:18,147
MARISHA: 23.

3481
03:39:18,147 --> 03:39:19,347
LAURA: 24.

3482
03:39:19,347 --> 03:39:22,609
TRAVIS: 11. Disadvantage.

3483
03:39:22,609 --> 03:39:24,340
TALIESIN: (laughs) You picked the wrong day to
stop sniffing glue.

3484
03:39:24,340 --> 03:39:29,338
TRAVIS: What the fuck? (laughs) I know. Paint
chips.

3485
03:39:29,338 --> 03:39:32,518
TALIESIN: You made a bad call.

3486
03:39:32,518 --> 03:39:34,675
TRAVIS: I made a bad call.

3487
03:39:34,675 --> 03:39:36,625
MATT: Grog. Vex, what was it you rolled, again?

3488
03:39:36,625 --> 03:39:37,811
LAURA: 24.

3489
03:39:37,811 --> 03:39:38,873
MATT: 24. And you rolled?

3490
03:39:38,873 --> 03:39:39,867
LIAM: 17.

3491
03:39:39,867 --> 03:39:45,877
MATT: 17. That's right. All right, so. As the roar
pierces through the hallway, most of you guys

3492
03:39:45,877 --> 03:39:54,518
steel yourself. Grog, Scanlan, Pike, and Vax, you
feel the sudden reality of how fearful and

3493
03:39:54,518 --> 03:39:58,911
dangerous this creature is. You stepped into the
lair of an ancient, powerful entity and you feel

3494
03:39:58,911 --> 03:40:01,710
like your very life is at stake. You guys are
frightened for one minute.

3495
03:40:01,710 --> 03:40:03,522
SAM: Okay.

3496
03:40:03,522 --> 03:40:07,789
MATT: Frightened means you have disadvantage on
ability checks and attack rolls while you can see

3497
03:40:07,789 --> 03:40:14,617
it, and you cannot willingly move closer to the
creature. So you have to either move adjacent,

3498
03:40:14,617 --> 03:40:22,151
like same distance from it, or away. You can make
a saving throw every turn to try and resist it. It

3499
03:40:22,151 --> 03:40:28,488
is now going to stay right where it is. That
brings it to Pike's turn. Pike doesn't quite know

3500
03:40:28,488 --> 03:40:33,484
how to deal with this whole circumstance. She is
going to cast--

3501
03:40:33,484 --> 03:40:36,052
TALIESIN: Text Ashley.

3502
03:40:36,052 --> 03:40:41,294
TRAVIS: There's also the obelisks. We got to go
start touching the other shit.

3503
03:40:41,294 --> 03:40:43,679
LAURA: Obelisks were in Elvish.

3504
03:40:43,679 --> 03:40:48,069
MARISHA: Issylra is a continent, right?

3505
03:40:48,069 --> 03:40:51,856
TRAVIS: It was all written in what, in--?

3506
03:40:51,856 --> 03:40:56,880
MATT: Pike is going to reach forward to you, Grog.
Take a step this way. Pike's going to reach

3507
03:40:56,880 --> 03:41:01,007
forward and cast Freedom of Movement on you. At
fourth level.

3508
03:41:01,007 --> 03:41:07,445
TRAVIS: Oh. I was going to rage and shake it,
but--

3509
03:41:07,445 --> 03:41:14,841
MATT: So for the next hour, you cannot be
paralyzed or restrained, you can't have your speed

3510
03:41:14,841 --> 03:41:19,941
reduced via magical effects. You're still feared,
but--

3511
03:41:19,941 --> 03:41:21,526
TRAVIS: I can shake that with a rage.

3512
03:41:21,526 --> 03:41:25,306
MATT: You can shake that with a rage, yes. But
yeah, for the next hour.

3513
03:41:25,306 --> 03:41:27,024
It's not concentration, either.

3514
03:41:27,024 --> 03:41:27,986
TRAVIS: Thank you, Pike.

3515
03:41:27,986 --> 03:41:29,279
MATT: She says, "Go get him, Grog."

3516
03:41:29,279 --> 03:41:30,461
TRAVIS: You got it, buddy!

3517
03:41:30,461 --> 03:41:34,390
MATT: All right. That ends Pike's turn. Grog,
you're up.

3518
03:41:34,390 --> 03:41:37,738
TRAVIS: I might as well do what Pike says. I'm
going to bum-rush the sphinx.

3519
03:41:37,738 --> 03:41:38,873
MATT: Straight-up?

3520
03:41:38,873 --> 03:41:39,962
TRAVIS: Yup.

3521
03:41:39,962 --> 03:41:41,795
MATT: All right. You rush up the stairs.

3522
03:41:41,795 --> 03:41:43,406
TALIESIN: Oh god.

3523
03:41:43,406 --> 03:41:49,311
MATT: With a precariousness of-- we'll say you rush
up here for the sake of positioning.

3524
03:41:49,311 --> 03:41:53,885
TRAVIS: Sure. Two strikes, straight-up.

3525
03:41:53,885 --> 03:41:55,856
SAM: Just going to hit it?

3526
03:41:55,856 --> 03:42:01,570
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah. I'm not smart, this is all
I do. 23?

3527
03:42:01,570 --> 03:42:04,784
MATT: 23? That hits.

3528
03:42:04,784 --> 03:42:09,372
TRAVIS: His face is awful. Should I roll damage or
roll both attacks first?

3529
03:42:09,372 --> 03:42:12,112
MATT: It's all against him, roll attacks. You're
not going to kill it in one hit.

3530
03:42:12,112 --> 03:42:13,326
TRAVIS: No, that's true.

3531
03:42:13,326 --> 03:42:16,795
SAM: What if it's a nine-point hit point?

3532
03:42:16,795 --> 03:42:21,686
TRAVIS: 24 on the first one.

3533
03:42:21,686 --> 03:42:23,263
MATT: 24 damage, all righty.

3534
03:42:23,263 --> 03:42:26,786
TRAVIS: Second attack. Holy shit, that's a 28.

3535
03:42:26,786 --> 03:42:28,659
MATT: Nice, that hits.

3536
03:42:28,659 --> 03:42:36,043
TRAVIS: Something's going to happen to me and it's
going to be bad. Six. 11. 23.

3537
03:42:36,043 --> 03:42:44,195
MATT: Okay. Makes its first constitution saving
throw. Fails its second. So you steal another

3538
03:42:44,195 --> 03:42:47,073
strength point and the sphinx's strength goes down
to that.

3539
03:42:47,073 --> 03:42:48,726
TRAVIS: So I'm at 25 now.

3540
03:42:48,726 --> 03:42:50,496
LAURA: Down to 79 strength.

3541
03:42:50,496 --> 03:42:52,082
MATT: You're at 25 now. Okay.

3542
03:42:52,082 --> 03:42:54,877
TRAVIS: And I don't go up again until 26. Right?
On the evens.

3543
03:42:54,877 --> 03:43:00,488
MATT: Right. But 25 is the max for this sword. It
says on the weapon, it should be under ability.

3544
03:43:00,488 --> 03:43:02,080
TRAVIS: Oh, you're right, yeah.

3545
03:43:02,080 --> 03:43:10,278
MATT: All right. So. You run up and swing two
heavy swings after going into a rage to resist the

3546
03:43:10,278 --> 03:43:16,044
fear effect. You grin and bear it, go over and
swing twice, hacking into the side of it. Its hide

3547
03:43:16,044 --> 03:43:21,434
is very strong and there's almost like this weird
resistance on the outside of its body, like its

3548
03:43:21,434 --> 03:43:25,601
very force of existence and personality is keeping
the blade from doing as much damage as it should,

3549
03:43:25,601 --> 03:43:29,856
but you still strike true, slamming into it twice.
You pull the strength from it. As you do, a voice

3550
03:43:29,856 --> 03:43:32,613
in your head goes, "Yesss."

3551
03:43:32,613 --> 03:43:35,220
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

3552
03:43:35,220 --> 03:43:42,553
MATT: At this point, as you look at the blade, the
blade now begins to emanate a shadow aura stronger

3553
03:43:42,553 --> 03:43:47,818
than previously that begins to also form around
your upper shoulders, drifting. The blade suddenly

3554
03:43:47,818 --> 03:43:54,782
extends another foot, the edges of it that were
smooth project with a jagged, thorny outside. The

3555
03:43:54,782 --> 03:44:03,303
blade itself now is longer, thicker, and far more
dangerous-looking than it was before. Until your

3556
03:44:03,303 --> 03:44:06,713
next short rest, all attacks with the sword do an
additional 2d6 necrotic damage.

3557
03:44:06,713 --> 03:44:09,563
ALL: Whoa!

3558
03:44:09,563 --> 03:44:21,347
TRAVIS: (laughs) Super Saiyan, motherfucker! 2d6
necrotic damage? Okay. And I'll stay there.

3559
03:44:21,347 --> 03:44:22,978
MATT: Okay.

3560
03:44:22,978 --> 03:44:25,808
TRAVIS: And await my punishment.

3561
03:44:25,808 --> 03:44:32,163
MATT: All right. At the end of your turn, the
sphinx is going to use its

3562
03:44:32,163 --> 03:44:33,781
three legendary actions.

3563
03:44:33,781 --> 03:44:37,039
LIAM: Three legendary actions?

3564
03:44:37,039 --> 03:44:41,099
MATT: Is going to use three of them to cast a
spell out of order. It's going to go ahead and

3565
03:44:41,099 --> 03:44:43,212
call down a Flame Strike.

3566
03:44:43,212 --> 03:44:44,842
LAURA: We're all going to die!

3567
03:44:44,842 --> 03:44:46,181
MATT: Onto the twins.

3568
03:44:46,181 --> 03:44:47,449
LAURA: Why?!

3569
03:44:47,449 --> 03:44:51,313
LIAM: Can I attack him now, while he's casting,
because I held my turn?

3570
03:44:51,313 --> 03:44:53,317
MATT: You can, actually, yes.

3571
03:44:53,317 --> 03:44:58,449
LIAM: Okay, so I'm hidden and Grog's next to him,
which would normally put me at advantage, but he's

3572
03:44:58,449 --> 03:45:02,030
got me afraid, which puts me at disadvantage,
which means it cancels out and it's one straight

3573
03:45:02,030 --> 03:45:03,961
roll, right? On the attacks?

3574
03:45:03,961 --> 03:45:05,918
MATT: Correct.

3575
03:45:05,918 --> 03:45:12,608
LIAM: Okay. Good. So I'm going to throw-- I'm
hasted, I'm going to throw two daggers at him. The

3576
03:45:12,608 --> 03:45:22,108
first one is, probably hits, where's the freaking
page? 23 for the first.

3577
03:45:22,108 --> 03:45:24,542
MATT: 23 hits.

3578
03:45:24,542 --> 03:45:26,669
LIAM: 18 for the second.

3579
03:45:26,669 --> 03:45:28,661
MATT: Okay.

3580
03:45:28,661 --> 03:45:31,604
LIAM: Do they both hit or just the first? I'm only
doing two.

3581
03:45:31,604 --> 03:45:32,741
MATT: What was the second one? It was--

3582
03:45:32,741 --> 03:45:33,605
LIAM: 18.

3583
03:45:33,605 --> 03:45:34,512
MATT: 18 hits.

3584
03:45:34,512 --> 03:45:41,705
LIAM: Okay, so the first one is seven, the second
is seven. And I want to use the rest of my turn

3585
03:45:41,705 --> 03:45:46,552
to, as I'm hasted, to run around to the back of
that obelisk and start reading.

3586
03:45:46,552 --> 03:45:48,043
MATT: Over here?

3587
03:45:48,043 --> 03:45:49,071
LIAM: Yeah.

3588
03:45:49,071 --> 03:45:54,883
MATT: Okay. All right. As you're doing that
reaction shot, it calls down the column, hits both

3589
03:45:54,883 --> 03:45:58,607
of you before you can burst off. All of a sudden,
as you look over at your brother, you feel this

3590
03:45:58,607 --> 03:46:05,133
rising energy before all of a sudden this entire
area is (boom) consumed in burning holy divine

3591
03:46:05,133 --> 03:46:08,259
light. I need both of you guys to make a dexterity
saving throw.

3592
03:46:08,259 --> 03:46:09,658
LIAM: I'm going to use evasion.

3593
03:46:09,658 --> 03:46:12,954
MATT: Yeah, evasion happens automatically as part
of your reaction to that, so yeah.

3594
03:46:12,954 --> 03:46:14,934
LIAM: Okay.

3595
03:46:14,934 --> 03:46:15,914
LAURA: 30.

3596
03:46:15,914 --> 03:46:20,122
LIAM: Dexterity, so 14.

3597
03:46:20,122 --> 03:46:21,267
MATT: You rolled a what?

3598
03:46:21,267 --> 03:46:22,107
LAURA: 30.

3599
03:46:22,107 --> 03:46:23,886
MATT: 30 dexterity saving throw?

3600
03:46:23,886 --> 03:46:31,523
LIAM: No, eff it, I'm going to use my last Luck of
the day. Ugh, barely any better. 16.

3601
03:46:31,523 --> 03:46:34,088
MATT: 16 for you?

3602
03:46:34,088 --> 03:46:35,134
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

3603
03:46:35,134 --> 03:46:42,616
MATT: Okay. Right, so Vex? You take half damage
from this. You take full damage, unfortunately. So

3604
03:46:42,616 --> 03:46:50,311
that's going to be 21 points of fire and radiant
damage to you.

3605
03:46:50,311 --> 03:46:51,476
TRAVIS: Is half?

3606
03:46:51,476 --> 03:46:57,467
MATT: 21 is the half. You, however, have
resistance to fire, Liam.

3607
03:46:57,467 --> 03:46:58,638
LIAM: Yes.

3608
03:46:58,638 --> 03:47:02,510
MATT: So the 22 points of fire damage you would've
taken is reduced to 11.

3609
03:47:02,510 --> 03:47:04,943
LIAM: With evasion, if I fail, I take half
damage.

3610
03:47:04,943 --> 03:47:13,680
MATT: Right, so yeah, so you would take, so you
would take the same, but a quarter because of

3611
03:47:13,680 --> 03:47:15,938
halving fire damage to take from that.

3612
03:47:15,938 --> 03:47:18,688
LIAM: So I didn't hear the number because I was
reading, what was--?

3613
03:47:18,688 --> 03:47:20,500
TRAVIS: 21, so half 21 would be 11.

3614
03:47:20,500 --> 03:47:29,429
MATT: Well, radiant damage you're not resistant to, so
I'd say it would be 17 points of damage. There you

3615
03:47:29,429 --> 03:47:33,781
go. You rush out of the flames and find your way
around the obelisk. However, you have to wait

3616
03:47:33,781 --> 03:47:39,012
until your turn before you can take a look at
that. All right, now it comes to Keyleth's turn.

3617
03:47:39,012 --> 03:47:48,510
MARISHA: Okay. I yell out: Issylra!

3618
03:47:48,510 --> 03:47:52,519
MATT: It doesn't seem to have any effect.

3619
03:47:52,519 --> 03:47:54,279
MARISHA: Okay, that might be a continent.

3620
03:47:54,279 --> 03:47:56,971
MATT: It is.

3621
03:47:56,971 --> 03:47:58,694
(laughter)

3622
03:47:58,694 --> 03:48:02,946
MATT: It's the continent where Vasselheim is,
and--

3623
03:48:02,946 --> 03:48:10,247
MARISHA: Not his name. And I cast Control Water
again and I start pouring the water out of the

3624
03:48:10,247 --> 03:48:14,534
pools and onto the fire.

3625
03:48:14,534 --> 03:48:21,604
MATT: Okay. The water comes out as a column,
doesn't appear to be coming to an end, you're not

3626
03:48:21,604 --> 03:48:25,509
quite sure where it's being drawn from, it's this
constant stream, and as it hits the flame (tshhh)

3627
03:48:25,509 --> 03:48:31,754
but the flames aren't going out. It's all turning
to steam and it's filling the room with steam and

3628
03:48:31,754 --> 03:48:36,009
the more and more it pours into it, the more and
more the room is beginning to become obscured and

3629
03:48:36,009 --> 03:48:37,530
making it hard to see.

3630
03:48:37,530 --> 03:48:39,041
MARISHA: Okay, well, I stop that.

3631
03:48:39,041 --> 03:48:43,726
MATT: Okay. As you do, the streams stop water. The
pools are still completely still where you've

3632
03:48:43,726 --> 03:48:48,936
pulled it out of, seemingly unbothered other than
the little bit of wind that's blowing, and have

3633
03:48:48,936 --> 03:48:50,907
not lessened in their volume at all.

3634
03:48:50,907 --> 03:48:55,586
MARISHA: Good to know. Can I do some sort of check
to see if I would've heard anything about this

3635
03:48:55,586 --> 03:49:00,433
type of a thing in my druid time, is this like a
different plane of existence, what is this shit?

3636
03:49:00,433 --> 03:49:02,127
MATT: What, this place you are?

3637
03:49:02,127 --> 03:49:08,488
MARISHA: Yeah, or would I know of what his name
would be from the telling of the Second Spark and

3638
03:49:08,488 --> 03:49:10,489
any of my elemental knowledge as a druid?

3639
03:49:10,489 --> 03:49:11,745
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

3640
03:49:11,745 --> 03:49:19,007
MARISHA: Ooh, that's good. 19.

3641
03:49:19,007 --> 03:49:27,346
MATT: 19. Thinking back about the stories you've
heard, which isn't a whole lot necessarily. Are we

3642
03:49:27,346 --> 03:49:28,928
good on the stream?

3643
03:49:28,928 --> 03:49:30,375
RYAN: (off-camera) Yeah, we're good on the
stream.

3644
03:49:30,375 --> 03:49:31,869
LIAM: Had a little flicker.

3645
03:49:31,869 --> 03:49:38,591
MATT: We had a little flicker. You recall, go
through, poring through all the information that

3646
03:49:38,591 --> 03:49:41,504
was given to you, you don't know a whole lot about
the history element, it isn't a part of the

3647
03:49:41,504 --> 03:49:48,159
druidic training experience, but based on the
discussion with Highbearer Vord, no mention of a

3648
03:49:48,159 --> 03:49:49,952
sphinx, nothing like that.

3649
03:49:49,952 --> 03:49:55,343
MARISHA: Fuck. I don't know, you guys!

3650
03:49:55,343 --> 03:49:58,062
MATT: I think that's your turn, though. Unless you
want to move.

3651
03:49:58,062 --> 03:49:59,618
MARISHA: No. I'm good.

3652
03:49:59,618 --> 03:50:08,784
MATT: Okay. End of your turn, the shimmering webs
on each side flash for a second, and stepping out

3653
03:50:08,784 --> 03:50:16,867
of them, you can see a slightly translucent, not
fully physical spider on each side.

3654
03:50:16,867 --> 03:50:22,610
LIAM: Fey spiders, you son of a-- oh god, I keep
hitting that, we got to fix that.

3655
03:50:22,610 --> 03:50:26,788
MATT: This spider immediately (skittering) up to
Percy. And this one (skittering) up to Vex.

3656
03:50:26,788 --> 03:50:28,239
LAURA: Ah, c'mon!

3657
03:50:28,239 --> 03:50:34,368
MATT: Versus you, Percy, rolled a one. Completely
missed. It goes and reaches out towards you, out

3658
03:50:34,368 --> 03:50:38,820
of the way. Vex, however, that is a 23.

3659
03:50:38,820 --> 03:50:40,283
LAURA: That hits me.

3660
03:50:40,283 --> 03:50:43,286
MATT: That hits. You go ahead and suffer--

3661
03:50:43,286 --> 03:50:45,083
LAURA: You go ahead and suffer!

3662
03:50:45,083 --> 03:50:51,279
MATT: (laughs) Suffer nine points of psychic
damage. The spider, upon biting you, dissipates

3663
03:50:51,279 --> 03:50:56,971
out of existence. It actually bites you and then
its form (shhk) into your head and causes this

3664
03:50:56,971 --> 03:51:02,786
psychic backlash and feedback in your head. The
other spider misses you and remains in existence.

3665
03:51:02,786 --> 03:51:04,692
Top of the round, Percy, you're up.

3666
03:51:04,692 --> 03:51:08,548
SAM: Oh, well if, at the end of the round, have I
not gone yet?

3667
03:51:08,548 --> 03:51:09,995
MATT: You have not gone yet, do you want to?

3668
03:51:09,995 --> 03:51:10,992
SAM: Can I go?

3669
03:51:10,992 --> 03:51:11,886
MATT: Yeah.

3670
03:51:11,886 --> 03:51:13,516
SAM: Yeah, I mean, I guess I'll attack at this
point.

3671
03:51:13,516 --> 03:51:14,878
MATT: Okay.

3672
03:51:14,878 --> 03:51:24,263
SAM: I'll try something that will definitely fail.
I will try and fail to put him into the Resilient

3673
03:51:24,263 --> 03:51:28,064
Sphere. Which I'm sure will fail. (laughs)

3674
03:51:28,064 --> 03:51:32,945
MATT: What is the DC on the Resilient Sphere?

3675
03:51:32,945 --> 03:51:35,695
SAM: Well, I don't have my stuff with me.

3676
03:51:35,695 --> 03:51:38,457
MATT: I believe if it's through the--

3677
03:51:38,457 --> 03:51:40,073
SAM: Through the hand cone?

3678
03:51:40,073 --> 03:51:42,326
MATT: The hand cone I think is 20 now, isn't it?

3679
03:51:42,326 --> 03:51:43,655
SAM: It's 20 now, yeah.

3680
03:51:43,655 --> 03:51:45,504
MATT: Okay, so it doesn't make its dexterity
saving throw.

3681
03:51:45,504 --> 03:51:47,367
SAM: But I have disadvantage on attack, but that
doesn't matter.

3682
03:51:47,367 --> 03:51:52,537
MATT: Doesn't matter for this one. That is 21.
Yep.

3683
03:51:52,537 --> 03:51:54,437
SAM: Okay.

3684
03:51:54,437 --> 03:51:59,622
MATT: So. You attempt to create the sphere around
it. As you can see it begins to encase the sphinx,

3685
03:51:59,622 --> 03:52:06,282
and the sphinx just-- its head, after staring at
Grog, goes (growls), and as it roars at you, the

3686
03:52:06,282 --> 03:52:09,836
sphere that's formed around it shatters and the
arcane essence is scattered

3687
03:52:09,836 --> 03:52:11,539
about the room and vanishes.

3688
03:52:11,539 --> 03:52:16,226
SAM: Can I ask him if his name is Earned?

3689
03:52:16,226 --> 03:52:18,948
MATT: He sits there glaring at you.

3690
03:52:18,948 --> 03:52:21,077
SAM: Okay, that's a stupid question, sorry.

3691
03:52:21,077 --> 03:52:23,536
TRAVIS: Maybe say it in Celestial.

3692
03:52:23,536 --> 03:52:24,886
SAM: I don't know Celestial!

3693
03:52:24,886 --> 03:52:26,173
LAURA: Say it in Celestial, Percy.

3694
03:52:26,173 --> 03:52:29,210
MATT: All right, so that's Percy's turn now,
Percy, what are you doing?

3695
03:52:29,210 --> 03:52:33,530
TALIESIN: The first thing I'm going to is, I'm
going to guess a name, because that's fun.

3696
03:52:33,530 --> 03:52:34,531
MATT: Sure.

3697
03:52:34,531 --> 03:52:39,718
TALIESIN: I'm going to yell, Lux! Whatever that
would be in Celestial. First light.

3698
03:52:39,718 --> 03:52:46,203
MATT: Okay. You shout out, and the sound of
Celestial being spoken has this echo to it, this,

3699
03:52:46,203 --> 03:52:55,360
Lux, and it fades afterward. It has no immediate
effect, the wind seems to swallow it around you

3700
03:52:55,360 --> 03:52:58,519
from all the noise going around. The sphinx has no
interest.

3701
03:52:58,519 --> 03:53:02,537
TALIESIN: That's fine, I'm going to take a slash
at that spider with my sword.

3702
03:53:02,537 --> 03:53:03,979
MATT: Go for it.

3703
03:53:03,979 --> 03:53:09,933
TALIESIN: That's 19.

3704
03:53:09,933 --> 03:53:11,427
MATT: 19 hits.

3705
03:53:11,427 --> 03:53:15,576
TALIESIN: I don't suppose that there's a keyword
dragon in there anywhere?

3706
03:53:15,576 --> 03:53:17,070
MATT: A what?

3707
03:53:17,070 --> 03:53:20,381
TALIESIN: I don't suppose there's a keyword dragon
anywhere in that spider's description, but--

3708
03:53:20,381 --> 03:53:22,220
MATT: (laughs) No, there isn't.

3709
03:53:22,220 --> 03:53:23,759
TALIESIN: Pissing in the wind.

3710
03:53:23,759 --> 03:53:27,005
MATT: It's okay. It is a magical sword you're
attacking with, right?

3711
03:53:27,005 --> 03:53:32,642
TALIESIN: It is a magical sword I'm attacking
with. That's 11 points of slashing damage.

3712
03:53:32,642 --> 03:53:35,676
MATT: This spider is scattered into ether.

3713
03:53:35,676 --> 03:53:39,262
TALIESIN: With my sword out, I'm going to run down
the hall and I'm going to take two more slashing

3714
03:53:39,262 --> 03:53:40,832
attacks at the web.

3715
03:53:40,832 --> 03:53:43,216
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll.

3716
03:53:43,216 --> 03:53:50,813
TALIESIN: 17, but really, how hard is it to hit a
web?

3717
03:53:50,813 --> 03:53:55,231
MATT: It's more about finding the right place to
do the proper damage, but that works, go ahead and

3718
03:53:55,231 --> 03:53:56,689
roll damage.

3719
03:53:56,689 --> 03:54:00,256
TALIESIN: That's 13 points of damage.

3720
03:54:00,256 --> 03:54:06,532
MATT: Okay. You cut through some of the threads,
it limps on one side, but it's still keeping

3721
03:54:06,532 --> 03:54:08,051
itself aloft.

3722
03:54:08,051 --> 03:54:10,784
TALIESIN: 19.

3723
03:54:10,784 --> 03:54:12,688
MATT: All right, that hits, go ahead and roll
damage.

3724
03:54:12,688 --> 03:54:16,489
TALIESIN: Ooh. 15 points of damage.

3725
03:54:16,489 --> 03:54:22,060
MATT: 15 points of damage. All right. With that,
the second strike, the thread dissipates and turns

3726
03:54:22,060 --> 03:54:27,333
into smoke and vanishes from existence. None of
the threads remain, it vanishes.

3727
03:54:27,333 --> 03:54:29,542
TALIESIN: Is there anything written on the wall?

3728
03:54:29,542 --> 03:54:31,792
MATT: Go ahead and roll an investigation check.

3729
03:54:31,792 --> 03:54:34,888
SAM: It says, "That guy's name is Paul."

3730
03:54:34,888 --> 03:54:36,572
MARISHA: Paul was here.

3731
03:54:36,572 --> 03:54:39,363
TALIESIN: 19.

3732
03:54:39,363 --> 03:54:45,211
MATT: Okay, 19. Glancing at the wall behind--

3733
03:54:45,211 --> 03:54:54,502
TALIESIN: Fucking brain! Knowledge is power. For
reals!

3734
03:54:54,502 --> 03:54:56,895
LAURA: Maybe that's his name. Power.

3735
03:54:56,895 --> 03:54:59,480
MATT: It says in Celestial, "Windows and doors."

3736
03:54:59,480 --> 03:55:02,485
LAURA: The sky. The sky.

3737
03:55:02,485 --> 03:55:05,937
TALIESIN: Water and sky.

3738
03:55:05,937 --> 03:55:08,972
MATT: It says windows and doors.

3739
03:55:08,972 --> 03:55:15,490
TALIESIN: I say out loud, windows and doors! Water
and sky! And that's--

3740
03:55:15,490 --> 03:55:21,370
MATT: That's your turn. Percy's over. Vax, you're
up.

3741
03:55:21,370 --> 03:55:24,304
LIAM: I'm taking a quick look at the obelisk that
I'm right in front of, I think it's in Elvish,

3742
03:55:24,304 --> 03:55:25,678
isn't it?

3743
03:55:25,678 --> 03:55:33,038
MATT: The obelisk in front of you? This actually,
aside from the symbol of Ioun, there's no writing

3744
03:55:33,038 --> 03:55:34,126
on it.

3745
03:55:34,126 --> 03:55:41,308
LIAM: There's nothing on it, nothing to do. I'm
going to throw three daggers through the web. Is

3746
03:55:41,308 --> 03:55:43,998
that the one-- so Percy's over there? I'm going to
throw three daggers through the web over there.

3747
03:55:43,998 --> 03:55:45,557
MATT: Okay, go for it.

3748
03:55:45,557 --> 03:55:55,298
LIAM: 13. 30. And 17.

3749
03:55:55,298 --> 03:55:57,813
MATT: All right, what was it? Sorry, it was?

3750
03:55:57,813 --> 03:55:59,954
LIAM: 13, 30, and 17.

3751
03:55:59,954 --> 03:56:02,664
MATT: All right, the second two hit, so go ahead
and roll damage.

3752
03:56:02,664 --> 03:56:09,649
LIAM: Ten and eight.

3753
03:56:09,649 --> 03:56:15,511
MATT: Ten and eight. All right. You throw two and
it cuts a few threads and the path of it falls

3754
03:56:15,511 --> 03:56:17,428
limp but the web stays up.

3755
03:56:17,428 --> 03:56:21,278
LIAM: And I can't move any closer to the sphinx at
this point, right, because of the fear?

3756
03:56:21,278 --> 03:56:22,458
MATT: Correct.

3757
03:56:22,458 --> 03:56:24,002
LIAM: So I'm stuck here, am I?

3758
03:56:24,002 --> 03:56:28,514
MATT: Yeah, you can't move any closer to it right
now. But you can make a saving throw at the end of

3759
03:56:28,514 --> 03:56:29,539
your turn to try--

3760
03:56:29,539 --> 03:56:32,702
LIAM: I will do that. I'd also like to take
one step to the right.

3761
03:56:32,702 --> 03:56:34,023
MATT: One step to the right? All right.

3762
03:56:34,023 --> 03:56:37,952
LIAM: This way, yeah. And no, I rolled an eight
for wisdom.

3763
03:56:37,952 --> 03:56:41,733
MATT: Okay, so you're still in the fear
effect. All right. By the way, Grog, go ahead and

3764
03:56:41,733 --> 03:56:44,211
make a saving throw to resist the effect so it's
gone, even though you--

3765
03:56:44,211 --> 03:56:46,863
TRAVIS: Oh, at disadvantage?

3766
03:56:46,863 --> 03:56:48,123
MATT: Yeah.

3767
03:56:48,123 --> 03:56:49,530
TRAVIS: Which saving throw?

3768
03:56:49,530 --> 03:56:50,994
MATT: It's wisdom.

3769
03:56:50,994 --> 03:56:52,242
TRAVIS: (laughs) Five.

3770
03:56:52,242 --> 03:56:54,508
MATT: All right, you're still under the effect.
And Scanlan, actually, roll it again.

3771
03:56:54,508 --> 03:56:56,058
TRAVIS: Oh, but I'm raging.

3772
03:56:56,058 --> 03:56:59,237
MATT: Right, you resist, I mean, it doesn't affect
you but it still persists.

3773
03:56:59,237 --> 03:57:00,250
TRAVIS: Got you.

3774
03:57:00,250 --> 03:57:01,929
MATT: If you stopped raging then the fear would
kick in.

3775
03:57:01,929 --> 03:57:05,096
SAM: Is this a saving throw?

3776
03:57:05,096 --> 03:57:06,543
MATT: This is wisdom.

3777
03:57:06,543 --> 03:57:08,788
SAM: And do I still get advantage or no, because
the first time it's cast.

3778
03:57:08,788 --> 03:57:10,326
MATT: You would, I'd say, sure.

3779
03:57:10,326 --> 03:57:14,899
SAM: 12.

3780
03:57:14,899 --> 03:57:20,614
MATT: 12, yeah. The fear still strikes in your
heart. All right. Vax, that's the end of your

3781
03:57:20,614 --> 03:57:34,636
turn. All right. I need everybody in here to go
ahead and reroll initiative as the time flux in

3782
03:57:34,636 --> 03:57:39,901
the room all of a sudden flickers and time seems
to shift and move. Everyone reroll initiative.

3783
03:57:39,901 --> 03:57:43,872
MARISHA: What? Well, that's a better roll.

3784
03:57:43,872 --> 03:57:49,523
SAM: Are we time bandits now? Is that what's
happening?

3785
03:57:49,523 --> 03:57:54,400
TALIESIN: Oh my god. His name is the Doctor.

3786
03:57:54,400 --> 03:57:56,623
(laughter)

3787
03:57:56,623 --> 03:57:59,700
MARISHA: But Doctor who?

3788
03:57:59,700 --> 03:58:02,881
TALIESIN: Doctor whom. That's always bothered me.
Doctor whom.

3789
03:58:02,881 --> 03:58:04,589
MATT: All right, so. 25 to 20.

3790
03:58:04,589 --> 03:58:06,662
SAM: 20.

3791
03:58:06,662 --> 03:58:07,821
MATT: 20.

3792
03:58:07,821 --> 03:58:10,983
LAURA: 23.

3793
03:58:10,983 --> 03:58:12,780
MATT: Okay.

3794
03:58:12,780 --> 03:58:17,940
LAURA: 22, that's a lie, 22.

3795
03:58:17,940 --> 03:58:19,913
SAM: Liar.

3796
03:58:19,913 --> 03:58:21,426
TALIESIN: Liar!

3797
03:58:21,426 --> 03:58:23,552
MATT: Okay. 20 to 15?

3798
03:58:23,552 --> 03:58:24,870
TALIESIN: 18.

3799
03:58:24,870 --> 03:58:25,907
MARISHA: 18.

3800
03:58:25,907 --> 03:58:26,924
TRAVIS: 17.

3801
03:58:26,924 --> 03:58:34,694
MATT: All right, we got Percy, Keyleth, Grog. All
right. And then.

3802
03:58:34,694 --> 03:58:37,566
LIAM: Ocho.

3803
03:58:37,566 --> 03:58:39,748
MATT: Ocho? Pike's before you.

3804
03:58:39,748 --> 03:58:44,026
LIAM: Time slippage, man.

3805
03:58:44,026 --> 03:58:53,288
MATT: Yeah man, it sucks. All right. That ends
that count. It is now its turn. The time shift

3806
03:58:53,288 --> 03:58:58,117
actually managed to lose your turn, both you and
Scanlan. You guys shifted

3807
03:58:58,117 --> 03:58:59,938
through the top of the order.

3808
03:58:59,938 --> 03:59:02,376
LAURA: Wait, but I still rolled a 22.

3809
03:59:02,376 --> 03:59:04,239
MATT: I know.

3810
03:59:04,239 --> 03:59:06,085
TALIESIN: I hate time travel so much.

3811
03:59:06,085 --> 03:59:07,669
TRAVIS: It screws a high roll.

3812
03:59:07,669 --> 03:59:14,079
MATT: Basically, Scanlan, you can go
simultaneously now. You lose your turn.

3813
03:59:14,079 --> 03:59:16,322
SAM: That sounds cool.

3814
03:59:16,322 --> 03:59:18,024
MATT: I mean, it's time, it's shitty.

3815
03:59:18,024 --> 03:59:20,434
TRAVIS: What's the Celestial word for time?

3816
03:59:20,434 --> 03:59:24,325
MARISHA: I know, we were thinking about that
time.

3817
03:59:24,325 --> 03:59:33,068
MATT: You know what? It doesn't specify. I'll say
go ahead. It starts at the top of the initiative

3818
03:59:33,068 --> 03:59:40,133
round, so you know what? Vex, your turn, go for
it. Go for it. Doesn't specify, I could be a dick

3819
03:59:40,133 --> 03:59:41,333
about it, but you know.

3820
03:59:41,333 --> 03:59:42,737
LAURA: I take back my glare.

3821
03:59:42,737 --> 03:59:44,925
MATT: It's more fun to not have your turn lost.

3822
03:59:44,925 --> 03:59:46,791
TALIESIN: There was a time jump so the glare never
happened.

3823
03:59:46,791 --> 03:59:50,623
MATT: What you got?

3824
03:59:50,623 --> 03:59:57,129
LAURA: Can I look up at the ceilings and see if
there's any portals on the top of the ceiling like

3825
03:59:57,129 --> 03:59:59,110
there were in the last room?

3826
03:59:59,110 --> 04:00:03,733
MATT: Make a perception check.

3827
04:00:03,733 --> 04:00:05,167
LAURA: 29.

3828
04:00:05,167 --> 04:00:07,761
MATT: 29. Nope, solid stone ceiling.

3829
04:00:07,761 --> 04:00:16,959
LAURA: Is there anything to tie the Robe of
Infinite Twine onto?

3830
04:00:16,959 --> 04:00:20,919
MATT: I mean, there's the brazier, but it's pretty
close to flame and you don't know if rope will

3831
04:00:20,919 --> 04:00:22,345
survive that.

3832
04:00:22,345 --> 04:00:24,815
LAURA: Do I still have the Immovable Rod from
before?

3833
04:00:24,815 --> 04:00:26,427
MATT: Yeah, you retrieved it, yeah.

3834
04:00:26,427 --> 04:00:30,861
LAURA: Okay, then I put the Immovable Rod, I tie
it in, I hold on to the rope,

3835
04:00:30,861 --> 04:00:32,533
and I jump in the water.

3836
04:00:32,533 --> 04:00:35,739
MATT: Okay. You take the rod and you (click) in
the middle of the air, you take the rope, tie it

3837
04:00:35,739 --> 04:00:40,185
around real fast over everything, and the sphinx
now looming forward being attacked and flanked by

3838
04:00:40,185 --> 04:00:49,480
the two of them. You take the rope and jump into
the water. There's no splash, you disappear into

3839
04:00:49,480 --> 04:00:52,854
the water. You guys watch her vanish into the
pool.

3840
04:00:52,854 --> 04:00:54,476
MARISHA: Vex jumped in the water?

3841
04:00:54,476 --> 04:00:55,659
MATT: Yeah.

3842
04:00:55,659 --> 04:00:56,760
MARISHA: Cool.

3843
04:00:56,760 --> 04:01:07,289
LIAM: The code is "critrole", and you will not
have to pay for any kind of shipment in any way,

3844
04:01:07,289 --> 04:01:10,498
shape, or form. The wood still costs.

3845
04:01:10,498 --> 04:01:15,494
MARISHA: Also, look how attractive that map is.
Dwarven Forge, everybody.

3846
04:01:15,494 --> 04:01:19,813
SAM: Oh boy. We'll be making an appearance--

3847
04:01:19,813 --> 04:01:25,978
TALIESIN: Don't do that. That's weird. Stop that.
God, every time you're off camera.

3848
04:01:25,978 --> 04:01:28,099
LIAM: Travis is flexing his boobies.

3849
04:01:28,099 --> 04:01:34,641
SAM: Guys, we're going to die because we can't
think of the name Steve.

3850
04:01:34,641 --> 04:01:36,858
TALIESIN: It'll be fine.

3851
04:01:36,858 --> 04:01:39,251
MARISHA: Yeah, there's a correlation with blue.

3852
04:01:39,251 --> 04:01:42,561
TALIESIN: I have theories. I have lots and lots of
theories.

3853
04:01:42,561 --> 04:01:43,880
MARISHA: I have lots of theories, too.

3854
04:01:43,880 --> 04:01:46,894
TALIESIN: I have lots of theories. There's lots of
theories here, we have to be fast enough to try

3855
04:01:46,894 --> 04:01:48,062
them out.

3856
04:01:48,062 --> 04:01:49,206
SAM: Test them out.

3857
04:01:49,206 --> 04:01:50,657
LIAM: And then time shifts and we're back in.

3858
04:01:50,657 --> 04:01:52,366
TALIESIN: I can only move so fast through the
room.

3859
04:01:52,366 --> 04:01:53,447
MATT: Do you pull yourself out?

3860
04:01:53,447 --> 04:01:54,847
LAURA: Yeah, I pull myself back out.

3861
04:01:54,847 --> 04:01:59,041
MATT: Okay, you guys, there's a breathless moment
and suddenly Vex comes out from the rope,

3862
04:01:59,041 --> 04:02:00,745
drenched in water.

3863
04:02:00,745 --> 04:02:02,933
LAURA: Oh my god.

3864
04:02:02,933 --> 04:02:04,052
SAM: What?

3865
04:02:04,052 --> 04:02:09,505
LAURA: K-A. Other door. But make sure there's a
rope.

3866
04:02:09,661 --> 04:02:11,491
SAM: K-A? What does that mean?

3867
04:02:11,491 --> 04:02:13,962
LAURA: Jump in the water. Make sure you can get
out.

3868
04:02:13,962 --> 04:02:15,456
SAM: What?

3869
04:02:15,456 --> 04:02:16,869
TRAVIS: K-A on the door?

3870
04:02:16,869 --> 04:02:18,250
SAM: What does that mean? What?

3871
04:02:18,250 --> 04:02:22,997
MATT: As you say K-A out loud, the sphinx goes--
there's a glimmer in the eye at you, and it

3872
04:02:22,997 --> 04:02:25,726
continues on, looking over at Grog and Scanlan.

3873
04:02:25,726 --> 04:02:27,609
SAM: You got part of the name? Part of the name.

3874
04:02:27,609 --> 04:02:32,215
MARISHA: Oh, son of a bitch! All right.

3875
04:02:32,215 --> 04:02:34,295
SAM: Which water did you go in?

3876
04:02:34,295 --> 04:02:35,830
LAURA: The little brazier that I'm next to.

3877
04:02:35,830 --> 04:02:37,004
SAM: Okay.

3878
04:02:37,004 --> 04:02:38,960
LAURA: But don't jump in without a rope.

3879
04:02:38,960 --> 04:02:41,528
MARISHA: You're on the one on the left. Yeah?

3880
04:02:41,528 --> 04:02:43,792
LAURA: Yeah. Make sure you can get out.

3881
04:02:43,792 --> 04:02:47,489
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Scanlan,
you're up.

3882
04:02:47,489 --> 04:02:57,036
SAM: Well, shit. I want to go diving, but I don't
think I'd make it over there. Shit. For now, I'll

3883
04:02:57,036 --> 04:03:00,129
just-- someone else is going to do the water
thing, I assume?

3884
04:03:00,129 --> 04:03:02,084
MARISHA: I can, I'm close by, I'm close by, I can
handle it.

3885
04:03:02,084 --> 04:03:08,071
MATT: At the end of your turn, the water that's
around you, it's freezing cold and you suffer

3886
04:03:08,071 --> 04:03:09,721
eight points of cold damage.

3887
04:03:09,721 --> 04:03:10,827
LAURA: Okay.

3888
04:03:10,827 --> 04:03:16,087
MATT: From the process of submerging into it.
However, once that damage hits, your body heat

3889
04:03:16,087 --> 04:03:19,808
manages to recover, and it turns back to normal
water temperature, so.

3890
04:03:19,808 --> 04:03:26,670
SAM: I'm going to, I will attempt to cast Eyebite
on the sphinx.

3891
04:03:26,670 --> 04:03:30,083
MATT: Okay. The DC is 20 on that?

3892
04:03:30,083 --> 04:03:31,001
SAM: Yeah.

3893
04:03:31,001 --> 04:03:33,097
MATT: What is the saving throw for that one?

3894
04:03:33,097 --> 04:03:34,167
SAM: Wisdom.

3895
04:03:34,167 --> 04:03:45,145
MATT: Wisdom. Eyebite it is. That is a 27. Yeah,
it resists the Eyebite.

3896
04:03:45,145 --> 04:03:56,675
SAM: What a dick. What a dick. Well, I can't do
anything else, so I will-- hi. Who's around? Who's

3897
04:03:56,675 --> 04:04:05,618
about to do something? I'll turn to Vax and
inspire him.

3898
04:04:05,618 --> 04:04:06,902
MATT: Okay, go for it.

3899
04:04:06,902 --> 04:04:11,740
SAM: That's it. I'll say, (singing) You are not
throwing away your shot, you are not throwing away your

3900
04:04:11,740 --> 04:04:16,506
shot, you're just like your sister, you're young,
brooding and hungry, and you're not throwing away

3901
04:04:16,506 --> 04:04:17,858
your shot.

3902
04:04:17,858 --> 04:04:20,070
(laughter)

3903
04:04:20,070 --> 04:04:28,875
MATT: That's fantastic. Okay. All right, so. You
take your d10 inspiration die. At the end of your

3904
04:04:28,875 --> 04:04:33,167
turn, it goes to the lair count. Lair count's
already happened this turn, so I'm not going to

3905
04:04:33,167 --> 04:04:41,016
keep that going. However, the sphinx does take its
turn. It's going to go ahead and loose a claw

3906
04:04:41,016 --> 04:04:49,534
attack at both of you. Against Scanlan, that is--

3907
04:04:49,534 --> 04:04:51,406
SAM: I'm going to use Cutting Words.

3908
04:04:51,406 --> 04:04:52,619
MATT: Okay. All right.

3909
04:04:52,619 --> 04:04:55,920
SAM: To get out of it. I'm going to blow my shawm.
(high-pitched lip whistle noise)

3910
04:04:55,920 --> 04:04:57,844
(laughter)

3911
04:04:57,844 --> 04:04:58,959
SAM: To distract it.

3912
04:04:58,959 --> 04:05:04,656
MATT: Roll a d10. It rolled a 25 to hit, so.

3913
04:05:04,656 --> 04:05:07,435
SAM: He's still going to hit me. A d10.

3914
04:05:07,435 --> 04:05:09,792
MATT: Yeah, so roll a d10 and that's how much it
reduces it by.

3915
04:05:09,792 --> 04:05:11,040
SAM: By eight.

3916
04:05:11,040 --> 04:05:16,200
MATT: By eight, that brings it to a 17. What's
your AC?

3917
04:05:16,200 --> 04:05:17,377
SAM: 16.

3918
04:05:17,377 --> 04:05:23,751
MATT: So it still hits you. Hits you for 28 points
of slashing damage as its giant claw (whoosh)

3919
04:05:23,751 --> 04:05:28,467
rakes across you. The sheer impact almost throws
you off the top of the platform, and you can feel

3920
04:05:28,467 --> 04:05:34,999
the blood beginning to seep from the wound under
your armor. It turns around and rapidly does a

3921
04:05:34,999 --> 04:05:39,942
full-on claw attack towards you, Grog. That is
going to be a 27 to hit.

3922
04:05:39,942 --> 04:05:41,047
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.

3923
04:05:41,047 --> 04:05:45,849
MATT: You also take 28 points of damage. It is
magical damage, however, you don't-- doesn't

3924
04:05:45,849 --> 04:05:53,619
matter for you, being, it's a resistance against slashing, so
you take 14 points of slashing damage from the

3925
04:05:53,619 --> 04:05:57,104
strike. That's going to end its turn. That brings
us to Percy.

3926
04:05:57,104 --> 04:05:58,475
TALIESIN: Who's that?

3927
04:05:58,475 --> 04:05:59,452
MARISHA: That's Ashley.

3928
04:05:59,452 --> 04:06:00,708
TALIESIN: That's Ashley?

3929
04:06:00,708 --> 04:06:01,797
MARISHA: That's Pike, yeah yeah.

3930
04:06:01,797 --> 04:06:03,954
TALIESIN: I'm going to yell at Pike, first thing.

3931
04:06:03,954 --> 04:06:04,996
MATT: Okay.

3932
04:06:04,996 --> 04:06:09,713
TALIESIN: Look into the wind, look into the
typhoon, tell me what you see!

3933
04:06:09,713 --> 04:06:13,809
MATT: "What?" She hears you, yeah.

3934
04:06:13,809 --> 04:06:19,542
TALIESIN: I'm going to run to the little stone
pile, and out of idle curiosity, I'm going to try

3935
04:06:19,542 --> 04:06:23,336
to shove a bunch of stuff away to see if there's
anything in there, look at the stones or

3936
04:06:23,336 --> 04:06:24,192
anything.

3937
04:06:24,192 --> 04:06:26,905
MATT: Okay, so you take your action, you start
pulling the stones away. As you rummage through,

3938
04:06:26,905 --> 04:06:31,737
you pull apart and you begin to see there is--
where there was hard rocks, you're starting to

3939
04:06:31,737 --> 04:06:37,030
find finer stones, until eventually you find sand.
Just like the sand that you encountered in the

3940
04:06:37,030 --> 04:06:39,013
previous room.

3941
04:06:39,013 --> 04:06:47,159
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to take a handful, I'm
going to grab a bunch of that and--

3942
04:06:47,159 --> 04:06:51,920
MATT: Okay, you reach in and as your hands
disappear into the sand, there's no resistance

3943
04:06:51,920 --> 04:06:55,931
once they hit the sand, they vanish into the sand.

3944
04:06:55,931 --> 04:06:58,002
TALIESIN: I put on my mask and I shove my head
in.

3945
04:06:58,002 --> 04:07:00,056
MATT: Okay. You shove your head through.

3946
04:07:00,056 --> 04:07:01,310
SAM: Whispers.

3947
04:07:01,310 --> 04:07:02,453
MARISHA: Whispers!

3948
04:07:02,453 --> 04:07:04,790
LAURA: So many whispers!

3949
04:07:04,790 --> 04:07:08,925
TRAVIS: You know what this means, right? Jump in
the fire.

3950
04:07:08,925 --> 04:07:13,339
SAM: Oh my god. Oh wait, we got to jump into all
these things?

3951
04:07:13,339 --> 04:07:17,102
LAURA: Maybe. I don't know. How long is his name?

3952
04:07:17,102 --> 04:07:19,024
MARISHA: Yeah, how long is his name?

3953
04:07:19,024 --> 04:07:20,097
SAM: Mississippi.

3954
04:07:20,097 --> 04:07:21,670
TRAVIS: Rumpelstiltskin.

3955
04:07:21,670 --> 04:07:25,461
MARISHA: You already did water, I'm wondering if
there's anything in the other one,

3956
04:07:25,461 --> 04:07:26,983
or I might try fire.

3957
04:07:26,983 --> 04:07:28,416
LAURA: Oh. You're right.

3958
04:07:28,416 --> 04:07:30,283
SAM: No, you've got to go for the water.

3959
04:07:30,283 --> 04:07:32,043
TRAVIS: The element is going to be a quarter of
the letters.

3960
04:07:32,043 --> 04:07:34,474
TALIESIN: I pull out my head and I yell, J-I.

3961
04:07:34,474 --> 04:07:35,451
LAURA: J-I.

3962
04:07:35,451 --> 04:07:36,545
SAM: K-A-J-I?

3963
04:07:36,545 --> 04:07:38,805
MARISHA: K-A-J-I.

3964
04:07:38,805 --> 04:07:40,117
LAURA: Kaiju.

3965
04:07:40,117 --> 04:07:47,189
MARISHA: K-A-J-I. But it could be any fucking
order. Wait, wait, wait! Did anyone take note of

3966
04:07:47,189 --> 04:07:48,961
the order on the cycle?

3967
04:07:48,961 --> 04:07:50,936
SAM and LIAM: It was a circle.

3968
04:07:50,936 --> 04:07:52,134
MARISHA: Never mind.

3969
04:07:52,134 --> 04:07:54,397
MATT: All right, Percy, that's your turn? You
going to move?

3970
04:07:54,397 --> 04:07:57,329
TALIESIN: I burned a whole turn doing that, didn't
I?

3971
04:07:57,329 --> 04:07:59,309
MATT: Yeah, that's going to be the rest of it. All
right, Keyleth, you're up.

3972
04:07:59,309 --> 04:08:08,014
MARISHA: Okay. Seeing Vex jump in and seeing Percy
stick his head in a wall, I run up to the fire

3973
04:08:08,014 --> 04:08:09,147
column.

3974
04:08:09,147 --> 04:08:10,591
TALIESIN: Yeah! Yeah!

3975
04:08:10,591 --> 04:08:16,515
MARISHA: Right there. And see if there's anything
in the fire.

3976
04:08:16,515 --> 04:08:19,459
MATT: Percy, you also suffered seven points of
damage from the crushing and bludgeoning on your

3977
04:08:19,459 --> 04:08:20,861
head as it passed through.

3978
04:08:20,861 --> 04:08:26,045
MARISHA: And I take the fire hand and I stick it,
and I light up my fire and I

3979
04:08:26,045 --> 04:08:27,383
stick it in the fire.

3980
04:08:27,383 --> 04:08:28,425
MATT: Okay.

3981
04:08:28,425 --> 04:08:29,488
MARISHA: Does anything happen?

3982
04:08:29,488 --> 04:08:36,545
MATT: You put your hand in and your hand is
still-- it's hot because of the flame that's on

3983
04:08:36,545 --> 04:08:39,425
it. As you put it in, it is a scorching hot pain.

3984
04:08:39,425 --> 04:08:40,576
MARISHA: Okay.

3985
04:08:40,576 --> 04:08:44,052
MATT: You take two points of fire damage just from
placing it in there.

3986
04:08:44,052 --> 04:08:48,315
MARISHA: Okay, I pull it out and I go fire
elemental.

3987
04:08:48,315 --> 04:08:49,785
MATT: Okay.

3988
04:08:49,785 --> 04:08:50,985
TALIESIN: Yeah!

3989
04:08:50,985 --> 04:08:53,032
TRAVIS: Do it, do it.

3990
04:08:53,032 --> 04:08:54,142
TALIESIN: You're my hero.

3991
04:08:54,142 --> 04:08:58,073
LIAM: Heat don't hurt.

3992
04:08:58,073 --> 04:09:02,886
MARISHA: And I stick my head, go into the fire.

3993
04:09:02,886 --> 04:09:04,234
MATT: Into the flame?

3994
04:09:04,234 --> 04:09:05,694
MARISHA: Into the flame!

3995
04:09:05,694 --> 04:09:08,803
(cheering)

3996
04:09:08,803 --> 04:09:13,408
LIAM: I think we should stop there. We should not
go into the wind.

3997
04:09:13,408 --> 04:09:15,176
SAM: Where's the wind one?

3998
04:09:15,176 --> 04:09:16,009
LIAM: Center.

3999
04:09:16,009 --> 04:09:16,947
SAM: Okay.

4000
04:09:16,947 --> 04:09:20,207
TRAVIS: Why? Was that sarcastic?

4001
04:09:20,207 --> 04:09:21,098
LIAM: Yeah.

4002
04:09:21,098 --> 04:09:26,627
TRAVIS: (Grog voice) It was lost on me. Your
subtle humor is lost on me.

4003
04:09:26,627 --> 04:09:28,923
SAM: What else can we plug?

4004
04:09:28,923 --> 04:09:30,288
LAURA: I don't know.

4005
04:09:30,288 --> 04:09:32,812
SAM: Be sure to follow us at @CriticalRole.

4006
04:09:32,812 --> 04:09:35,744
LAURA: Hey, we're on twitter, you guys!
@CriticalRole.

4007
04:09:35,744 --> 04:09:37,193
SAM: @CriticalRole is on twitter.

4008
04:09:37,193 --> 04:09:38,757
TRAVIS: Don't miss the beginning of the 50th
episode.

4009
04:09:38,757 --> 04:09:45,754
MARISHA: I pull my head out and I go, M-A-L. The
letters M-A-L.

4010
04:09:45,754 --> 04:09:48,959
SAM: Kajimal. Kajimal. His name's Michael
Jackson.

4011
04:09:48,959 --> 04:09:57,093
MATT: All right, that's going to be your turn
there. At the end of your turn, he's going to go

4012
04:09:57,093 --> 04:10:02,582
ahead and use a point to do a claw attack against
Scanlan again.

4013
04:10:02,582 --> 04:10:04,515
LIAM: His name is probably Jamal Porter.

4014
04:10:04,515 --> 04:10:06,288
MATT: Hm. That's a natural 20.

4015
04:10:06,288 --> 04:10:08,153
TRAVIS: Natural 20?

4016
04:10:08,153 --> 04:10:09,659
MATT: Yeah.

4017
04:10:09,659 --> 04:10:13,942
SAM: No worries. I didn't need to live anyway.

4018
04:10:13,942 --> 04:10:16,665
MARISHA: Against Scanlan? Oh, Jesus Christ.

4019
04:10:16,665 --> 04:10:23,990
MATT: You take 38 points of slashing damage as the
claw grabs you and slams you against the stone,

4020
04:10:23,990 --> 04:10:26,519
and you can feel the claw actually pierce part of
your throat.

4021
04:10:26,519 --> 04:10:27,781
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

4022
04:10:27,781 --> 04:10:31,631
MATT: And as it withdraws, you can feel the blood
beginning to pour. It didn't hit anything vital,

4023
04:10:31,631 --> 04:10:33,822
but it's a serious wound--

4024
04:10:33,822 --> 04:10:35,796
SAM: All the vital stuff's below the belt.

4025
04:10:35,796 --> 04:10:43,723
MATT: All right. That ends Keyleth's turn. That
brings us to Grog. This thing is tearing into

4026
04:10:43,723 --> 04:10:45,186
Scanlan.

4027
04:10:45,186 --> 04:10:50,526
TRAVIS: Yeah. I run over to Scanlan. How jacked-up
are you?

4028
04:10:50,526 --> 04:10:52,231
SAM: I'm all right.

4029
04:10:52,231 --> 04:10:53,265
TRAVIS: Are you?

4030
04:10:53,265 --> 04:10:54,531
SAM: Totally fine.

4031
04:10:54,531 --> 04:10:57,700
TRAVIS: All right. Then I run down the steps and I
jump into the tornado.

4032
04:10:57,700 --> 04:11:04,369
MATT: (laughs) Okay. You leap into it.

4033
04:11:04,369 --> 04:11:06,220
LAURA: Oh no, Grog can't read.

4034
04:11:06,220 --> 04:11:07,915
(laughter)

4035
04:11:07,915 --> 04:11:09,486
SAM: Oh no, that's true!

4036
04:11:09,486 --> 04:11:14,280
MATT: Pike looks over and sees you whoosh into the
cyclone and vanish.

4037
04:11:14,280 --> 04:11:18,136
TRAVIS: (laughs) There's a couple of lines.

4038
04:11:18,136 --> 04:11:19,420
LIAM: Squiggly lines.

4039
04:11:19,420 --> 04:11:21,830
LAURA: It's like a--

4040
04:11:21,830 --> 04:11:26,118
LIAM: Snake shape and a box.

4041
04:11:26,118 --> 04:11:28,366
LAURA: There's a circle.

4042
04:11:28,366 --> 04:11:34,905
SAM: Two sticks and a snake.

4043
04:11:34,905 --> 04:11:38,753
LIAM: (Grog voice) Six. It said six.

4044
04:11:38,753 --> 04:11:42,119
LAURA: (Grog voice) Also ale.

4045
04:11:42,119 --> 04:11:44,058
SAM: Cake and a rope.

4046
04:11:44,058 --> 04:11:45,822
MARISHA: Good call.

4047
04:11:45,822 --> 04:11:48,693
LAURA: Was that O-I?

4048
04:11:48,693 --> 04:11:50,695
TALIESIN: This is why I'm the smart one.

4049
04:11:50,695 --> 04:11:53,249
MARISHA: You are. You are.

4050
04:11:53,249 --> 04:11:54,455
TALIESIN: Arsehole.

4051
04:11:54,455 --> 04:12:02,420
SAM: Check out our 50th episode next week,
guys, with special guests Vin Diesel--

4052
04:12:02,420 --> 04:12:08,096
TALIESIN: It's going to be so fleek. Streets
ahead.

4053
04:12:08,096 --> 04:12:10,564
MATT: Okay, you guys get the idea of what's going
on, we're going to now bring this, because now

4054
04:12:10,564 --> 04:12:14,060
shit's happening. So. Grog, after seeing this,
though you cannot say to anyone what you found

4055
04:12:14,060 --> 04:12:20,690
yet, you, having no tether, are drifting away from
the portal and seeing it disappearing slowly away

4056
04:12:20,690 --> 04:12:22,075
from you. What are you going to do?

4057
04:12:22,075 --> 04:12:25,444
TRAVIS: Can I grab my earring and say what I see?

4058
04:12:25,444 --> 04:12:29,963
MATT: You grab your earring, you say it. There's
no response. You guys hear nothing.

4059
04:12:29,963 --> 04:12:33,307
SAM: He's gone.

4060
04:12:33,307 --> 04:12:35,154
MATT: And you're about 15 feet away from it now.

4061
04:12:35,154 --> 04:12:36,542
LAURA: Grog?

4062
04:12:36,542 --> 04:12:41,166
TRAVIS: Can I take my Chain of Returning and
attach it to Craven Edge and throw it through the

4063
04:12:41,166 --> 04:12:42,340
doorway that I see?

4064
04:12:42,340 --> 04:12:44,382
MATT: You can. Go ahead and roll for an attack.

4065
04:12:44,382 --> 04:12:45,972
LAURA: What if it hits Pike?

4066
04:12:45,972 --> 04:12:47,905
TALIESIN: Should've had a breakfast!

4067
04:12:47,905 --> 04:12:49,898
TRAVIS: 23.

4068
04:12:49,898 --> 04:12:59,128
MATT: 23. Whoosh. You fling it through, and it
catches something. You feel it's taut, you start

4069
04:12:59,128 --> 04:13:04,171
pulling your way in, pulling your way in, pulling
your way in. Go ahead and roll damage.

4070
04:13:04,171 --> 04:13:05,649
LAURA and MARISHA: It's Pike.

4071
04:13:05,649 --> 04:13:06,574
TALIESIN: Oh.

4072
04:13:06,574 --> 04:13:08,531
SAM: God. It's fine.

4073
04:13:08,531 --> 04:13:10,017
MARISHA: It's got to be Pike.

4074
04:13:10,017 --> 04:13:14,336
TRAVIS: Damage, oh, damage. Sorry, damage. I
rolled the wrong thing.

4075
04:13:14,336 --> 04:13:16,623
Please don't let it be Pike. Nine.

4076
04:13:16,623 --> 04:13:18,149
LAURA: Pike.

4077
04:13:18,149 --> 04:13:19,859
TRAVIS: 14.

4078
04:13:19,859 --> 04:13:22,732
LAURA: Plus 2d6 necrotic.

4079
04:13:22,732 --> 04:13:24,551
MATT: Yep, plus 2d6 necrotic damage.

4080
04:13:24,551 --> 04:13:29,674
TRAVIS: 30.

4081
04:13:29,674 --> 04:13:34,554
MATT: 30. 30 points of damage. Okay. You pull the
chain and you make your way to the portal, you put

4082
04:13:34,554 --> 04:13:38,769
your hands out, pull through, and as you do, the
chain in your hand-- you look and you can see now,

4083
04:13:38,769 --> 04:13:46,174
grasping onto the edge of the wall, you see Pike,
sweat dripping down her face as Craven Edge has

4084
04:13:46,174 --> 04:13:51,301
embedded itself into her abdomen. She's holding
it, and she looks at you with a gritted face and

4085
04:13:51,301 --> 04:13:55,957
she goes, "It's okay, Grog. You're back, that's
all that matters."

4086
04:13:55,957 --> 04:14:00,669
LAURA: That's the saddest thing ever!

4087
04:14:00,669 --> 04:14:06,537
TRAVIS: I crawl through the door. Can I run to Pike?
That's my turn.

4088
04:14:06,537 --> 04:14:08,644
SAM: Did you get any of his name?

4089
04:14:08,644 --> 04:14:17,398
MATT: Doesn't have a chance yet. At the end of this
turn, it uses the last two points of its legendary

4090
04:14:17,398 --> 04:14:19,209
actions to Teleport.

4091
04:14:19,209 --> 04:14:20,762
SAM: I'm going to Counterspell that.

4092
04:14:20,762 --> 04:14:22,083
MATT: Okay.

4093
04:14:22,083 --> 04:14:23,972
SAM: Don't know why.

4094
04:14:23,972 --> 04:14:26,467
LIAM: Keep it away from Pike and Grog!

4095
04:14:26,467 --> 04:14:27,647
TALIESIN: It's always the right move.

4096
04:14:27,647 --> 04:14:29,461
LIAM: Yeah. Instinct, buddy.

4097
04:14:29,461 --> 04:14:33,465
MATT: All right. So now we get to go ahead and
roll for this, I believe. Let me go ahead and

4098
04:14:33,465 --> 04:14:43,277
check what level it is, I believe it's a-- all
right, this is a 7th-level spell.

4099
04:14:43,277 --> 04:14:50,016
SAM: Jesus. I mean, I wrote down crazy things, but
it says at level four, roll plus five, versus ten

4100
04:14:50,016 --> 04:14:52,262
plus level. I don't even know what that means!

4101
04:14:52,262 --> 04:14:57,083
MATT: Here, hold on. So DC equals ten plus level,
so it's DC 17.

4102
04:14:57,083 --> 04:15:00,666
SAM: Okay. So I have to roll?

4103
04:15:00,666 --> 04:15:08,079
MATT: Using an ability check. Roll d20 and add
five, trying to beat a 17.

4104
04:15:08,079 --> 04:15:11,526
SAM: Ability check at disadvantage.

4105
04:15:11,526 --> 04:15:13,261
MATT: Yes.

4106
04:15:13,261 --> 04:15:15,195
SAM: Yeah, that's not going to happen.

4107
04:15:15,195 --> 04:15:16,626
LIAM: Yes it is, come on.

4108
04:15:16,626 --> 04:15:22,531
SAM: Well, that would've worked. The first one was
an 11 plus five.

4109
04:15:22,531 --> 04:15:30,544
MATT: 16. One under. You go to Counterspell, but
the image of its head, and seeing Pike wounded,

4110
04:15:30,544 --> 04:15:35,173
it's too much for you and your hand shakes and you
can't manage to clarify the Dispel Magic, as the

4111
04:15:35,173 --> 04:15:43,823
whole sphinx vanishes and appears right next to
Pike. All right. That brings us to Vax.

4112
04:15:43,823 --> 04:15:48,404
LIAM: Can I try to make my wisdom save before I do
anything, or does that come at the end?

4113
04:15:48,404 --> 04:15:49,620
MATT: At the end of your turn.

4114
04:15:49,620 --> 04:15:52,365
LIAM: All right. Then I'm going to come around the
corner.

4115
04:15:52,365 --> 04:15:54,086
MATT: It's not in your sight, by the way, you
don't see it.

4116
04:15:54,086 --> 04:16:00,961
LIAM: I know. Can I walk over, yeah, ten feet that
way and see it scowling down at Pike.

4117
04:16:00,961 --> 04:16:02,559
MATT: You can, yeah, around the edge.

4118
04:16:02,559 --> 04:16:04,330
LIAM: And put three daggers in its flank.

4119
04:16:04,330 --> 04:16:05,515
MATT: Go for it.

4120
04:16:05,515 --> 04:16:12,029
LIAM: First one misses, it's a 13. 24. And a 15.

4121
04:16:12,029 --> 04:16:15,775
MATT: All right. 13, 24, 15.

4122
04:16:15,775 --> 04:16:16,930
LIAM: Yeah.

4123
04:16:16,930 --> 04:16:17,908
MATT: Middle one hits.

4124
04:16:17,908 --> 04:16:21,340
LIAM: Eight. Eight points of damage. I'm going to
try to shake off the fear.

4125
04:16:21,340 --> 04:16:23,821
MATT: Eight points. It does get sneak attack
because it's adjacent to Pike.

4126
04:16:23,821 --> 04:16:29,364
LIAM: But am I at disadvantage because of the
fear? I thought I was at disadvantage.

4127
04:16:29,364 --> 04:16:33,331
MATT: Oh, you're at disadvantage to all the
attacks, yeah. Wait, I'm sorry. I thought those

4128
04:16:33,331 --> 04:16:34,354
were your three attacks.

4129
04:16:34,354 --> 04:16:38,359
LIAM: I did three attack rolls, but I thought that
to get sneak attack damage I need advantage, but

4130
04:16:38,359 --> 04:16:40,032
if I'm afraid, I don't have advantage.

4131
04:16:40,032 --> 04:16:44,205
MATT: Right, but Pike's still adjacent. That's one
of the ways you can get sneak attack, is either

4132
04:16:44,205 --> 04:16:46,516
having advantage or an ally's adjacent.

4133
04:16:46,516 --> 04:16:53,336
LIAM: All right. I thought that meant that, sorry.
All right, I'll take it. Four, seven, 13, 25.

4134
04:16:53,336 --> 04:16:58,606
Added to what I said before, which was eight, so
33.

4135
04:16:58,606 --> 04:17:04,511
MATT: 33. So one dagger, two of them you throw and
they vanish into the cyclone, consumed and

4136
04:17:04,511 --> 04:17:12,601
thankfully return with magic or they would be gone
for good. Third one you throw. It stabs into the

4137
04:17:12,601 --> 04:17:19,956
shank of the sphinx, who growls, turns back to
Pike. All right, is that your turn?

4138
04:17:19,956 --> 04:17:25,863
LIAM: I don't know what I rolled, so I'm going to
roll again. 20.

4139
04:17:25,863 --> 04:17:30,682
MATT: 20. You manage to finally shake off the
fear. All right.

4140
04:17:30,682 --> 04:17:32,159
LIAM: Can I use the rest of my movement?

4141
04:17:32,159 --> 04:17:33,596
MATT: You can, yes.

4142
04:17:33,596 --> 04:17:35,555
LIAM: I'm going to run up to the side of the
sphinx.

4143
04:17:35,555 --> 04:17:52,766
MATT: You're there. All righty. Now produces two
spiders. Jump out of the web. Both of them, the

4144
04:17:52,766 --> 04:18:01,423
only thing they see, rush up to Vex. That is a
natural 20 and a two. (laughs) So the second one

4145
04:18:01,423 --> 04:18:09,482
misses you, first one you take 16 points of
psychic damage, and that one vanishes on the

4146
04:18:09,482 --> 04:18:14,853
impact. All right. That ends their turn. Up to the
top, Vex, it's your turn.

4147
04:18:14,853 --> 04:18:17,178
LAURA: Grog, what did you see?

4148
04:18:17,178 --> 04:18:20,065
TRAVIS: Can I respond?

4149
04:18:20,065 --> 04:18:26,912
MATT: I would say make a wisdom saving throw. At
the sight of what you've done to Pike and all that

4150
04:18:26,912 --> 04:18:30,058
is happening, this is to see if you can shake from
the stupor of what has happened.

4151
04:18:30,058 --> 04:18:31,945
TRAVIS: Nine.

4152
04:18:31,945 --> 04:18:33,494
MATT: He's not responsive right now.

4153
04:18:33,494 --> 04:18:49,362
LAURA: I guess I-- Jesus. Can I bring Trinket out?
That's stupid. If I, well, I'm going to go and try

4154
04:18:49,362 --> 04:18:51,551
to see what's going on over there with the
sphinx.

4155
04:18:51,551 --> 04:18:54,133
MATT: Okay, so you rush over right there?

4156
04:18:54,133 --> 04:18:56,687
LAURA: Can I see Grog?

4157
04:18:56,687 --> 04:18:59,917
MATT: You can, you can see Grog. As you rush
around the corner, you can see the sphinx there,

4158
04:18:59,917 --> 04:19:07,665
you see Pike with Craven Edge partially embedded
in her abdomen, the chain now lax, as Grog is

4159
04:19:07,665 --> 04:19:13,373
standing on the outside of the portal holding it
in his hand, his eyes wide. The rage has faded

4160
04:19:13,373 --> 04:19:14,666
now, by the way.

4161
04:19:14,666 --> 04:19:15,892
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4162
04:19:15,892 --> 04:19:20,434
LAURA: Can I run forward and cast Cure Wounds on
Pike?

4163
04:19:20,434 --> 04:19:23,154
SAM: She's Pike!

4164
04:19:23,154 --> 04:19:28,363
LAURA: She's got a fucking sword in her! Can I
help her?

4165
04:19:28,363 --> 04:19:30,893
MATT: Yeah, you could cast Cure Wounds if you
want.

4166
04:19:30,893 --> 04:19:33,963
LAURA: I mean, does she still have a sword through
her, can I pull her off of it and then cast it?

4167
04:19:33,963 --> 04:19:35,894
MATT: Sword is still inside of her right now,
yeah.

4168
04:19:35,894 --> 04:19:39,862
LIAM: Don't do damage to yourself.

4169
04:19:39,862 --> 04:19:44,598
MATT: You can try and pull it out if you want to.
Make a strength check. Roll a d20, add your

4170
04:19:44,598 --> 04:19:45,753
strength modifier.

4171
04:19:45,753 --> 04:19:47,941
LAURA: I know, I-- oh, natural 20!

4172
04:19:47,941 --> 04:19:52,002
MATT: And for the one who normally can't find the
physical strength of activities like this, through

4173
04:19:52,002 --> 04:19:53,514
the inspiration of seeing--

4174
04:19:53,514 --> 04:19:55,221
LAURA: It reminds me of what happened to Pike
before.

4175
04:19:55,221 --> 04:20:00,348
MATT: Yeah. And that clear image crystallizes in
your mind of when that glabrezu snatched her from

4176
04:20:00,348 --> 04:20:05,621
you once. And with that, you find the strength to
persevere, you reach out and grabbing the jagged

4177
04:20:05,621 --> 04:20:13,440
blade take nine points of necrotic damage in
touching the outside of the blade, but you pull,

4178
04:20:13,440 --> 04:20:19,382
you can see the blood forming at the edge of your
fingers as you yank it outside of Pike's body, and

4179
04:20:19,382 --> 04:20:24,014
it clatters to the ground at the base of Grog's
feet. Grog's still seeing this all before you,

4180
04:20:24,014 --> 04:20:26,693
eyes wide open, mouth agape.

4181
04:20:26,693 --> 04:20:30,147
LAURA: Grog, snap out of it! And I cast Cure
Wounds on Pike's stomach.

4182
04:20:30,147 --> 04:20:31,235
MATT: Okay, what level?

4183
04:20:31,235 --> 04:20:32,249
LAURA: Level three.

4184
04:20:32,249 --> 04:20:35,290
MATT: Level three. So 3d8 plus, I think it's--
what's your modifier for wisdom?

4185
04:20:35,290 --> 04:20:38,683
LAURA: Three.

4186
04:20:38,683 --> 04:20:44,714
MATT: So 3d8 plus three. And that will end Vex's
turn. Scanlan, you're up.

4187
04:20:44,714 --> 04:20:46,507
SAM: Can I roll to see if I'm fearful?

4188
04:20:46,507 --> 04:20:47,998
MATT: That'll be the end of your turn.

4189
04:20:47,998 --> 04:20:54,009
SAM: Okay. Then I'm going to, as a bonus action,
cast Healing Words on myself.

4190
04:20:54,009 --> 04:20:55,179
LAURA: 17.

4191
04:20:55,179 --> 04:20:57,242
MATT: 17? Okay, good to know.

4192
04:20:57,242 --> 04:21:10,083
SAM: I'll heal myself at level two. 2d4 plus
five. Okay. Seven points, great. And then for my

4193
04:21:10,083 --> 04:21:13,079
action I'll Dimension Door into the tornado.

4194
04:21:13,079 --> 04:21:24,560
MATT: Okay. You Dimension Door into the cyclone.
You find yourself on the outside of the wind

4195
04:21:24,560 --> 04:21:30,556
before it grabs you and pulls you in. You step
through a portal and you're now drifting out in an

4196
04:21:30,556 --> 04:21:37,313
expanse of air and cloud. There's no up, there's
no down, there's no left or right, you see various

4197
04:21:37,313 --> 04:21:43,617
masses of land slowly rotating in place as you see
different gusts of wind floating about. You drift

4198
04:21:43,617 --> 04:21:47,651
by and see a single stone that has carvings on
it.

4199
04:21:47,651 --> 04:21:50,166
SAM: Dammit.

4200
04:21:50,166 --> 04:21:52,284
TALIESIN: You did this to yourself.

4201
04:21:52,284 --> 04:21:55,956
SAM: Great.

4202
04:21:55,956 --> 04:22:01,395
MATT: However, you have no anchor and you are
drifting away from the opening you came through.

4203
04:22:01,395 --> 04:22:06,308
SAM: That's my action and my bonus. I have no
movement.

4204
04:22:06,308 --> 04:22:07,680
MATT: Correct, so you were--

4205
04:22:07,680 --> 04:22:09,233
SAM: I'm gonna just do this.

4206
04:22:09,233 --> 04:22:15,289
MATT: Okay. You do that. There's, it's air, you're
still drifting away. All right. That brings us to

4207
04:22:15,289 --> 04:22:24,007
the top of the initiative round. Let's see. For
this one, I need everyone in the room to go ahead

4208
04:22:24,007 --> 04:22:26,150
and make another constitution saving throw.

4209
04:22:26,150 --> 04:22:31,668
TRAVIS: So ready for a nap. 24.

4210
04:22:31,668 --> 04:22:37,609
MATT: 24. Vex, what'd you get?

4211
04:22:37,609 --> 04:22:39,019
LAURA: Six.

4212
04:22:39,019 --> 04:22:40,844
LIAM: Seven.

4213
04:22:40,844 --> 04:22:42,291
MATT: Keyleth?

4214
04:22:42,291 --> 04:22:45,687
MARISHA: Do I use my fire elemental constitution?
14.

4215
04:22:45,687 --> 04:22:47,163
TALIESIN: 18.

4216
04:22:47,163 --> 04:22:50,547
MATT: 18. Okay. Pike makes it.

4217
04:22:50,547 --> 04:22:52,545
LAURA: So hard to get these last two fucking
letters.

4218
04:22:52,545 --> 04:22:54,756
MATT: Okay, so you rolled a 14?

4219
04:22:54,756 --> 04:22:55,743
MARISHA: 14.

4220
04:22:55,743 --> 04:23:01,393
MATT: All right, so Keyleth, Vax, and Vex, all
three of you guys suddenly feel the wind pulled

4221
04:23:01,393 --> 04:23:06,368
out from you once again, and you all age, and now
I'm giving you the specifics here, you're

4222
04:23:06,368 --> 04:23:16,787
aging each time this happens. Ten years. All three
of you. Bones are starting to ache a little bit.

4223
04:23:16,787 --> 04:23:21,993
Not terribly, but a little more than usual. Your
body's now starting to feel the wear of time

4224
04:23:21,993 --> 04:23:22,971
passage.

4225
04:23:22,971 --> 04:23:24,571
TRAVIS: If that's happened twice, they're 20 years
older.

4226
04:23:24,571 --> 04:23:26,652
MATT: Yeah. 25 for those who got hit before.

4227
04:23:26,652 --> 04:23:29,540
SAM: Wait, the first time was 25 years?

4228
04:23:29,540 --> 04:23:32,768
MATT: The first one was 15, now it's an additional
ten to those who were hit.

4229
04:23:32,768 --> 04:23:34,438
LAURA: The first one was 15?

4230
04:23:34,438 --> 04:23:35,684
MATT: Yes.

4231
04:23:35,684 --> 04:23:42,874
LAURA: Wow. But as a half-elf you have a longer
life, so really at age 50, you're not that far in.

4232
04:23:42,874 --> 04:23:47,546
MATT: It's not huge, it's not like a major
difference. You know, 25 years to a human, to

4233
04:23:47,546 --> 04:23:55,766
Percy, would be a lot harsher than it is to you
guys. It's minor differences. It is now the

4234
04:23:55,766 --> 04:24:02,070
sphinx's turn, the sphinx is now going to (roars)
roar even louder this time. This roar echoes out

4235
04:24:02,070 --> 04:24:07,198
with a shockwave. I need everybody except for
Scanlan to make another wisdom saving throw.

4236
04:24:07,198 --> 04:24:08,536
MARISHA: Fuck me.

4237
04:24:08,536 --> 04:24:13,624
TRAVIS: Ten.

4238
04:24:13,624 --> 04:24:17,758
MATT: Ten? And you were still frightened from
previously, right? Because you did not shake that.

4239
04:24:17,758 --> 04:24:20,761
TRAVIS: Yeah, I never shook it, still in a rage,
but never shook it.

4240
04:24:20,761 --> 04:24:22,137
LAURA: But your rage ended.

4241
04:24:22,137 --> 04:24:26,818
MATT: You dropped the rage. All right. Pike. All
right.

4242
04:24:26,818 --> 04:24:28,184
LAURA: Natural 20.

4243
04:24:28,184 --> 04:24:29,145
LIAM: 11.

4244
04:24:29,145 --> 04:24:30,158
MARISHA: 24.

4245
04:24:30,158 --> 04:24:31,165
TALIESIN: 19.

4246
04:24:31,165 --> 04:24:37,388
MATT: All right, so. Vax, suddenly as the blast
hits, the fear hits you again as the sound

4247
04:24:37,388 --> 04:24:39,191
vanishes and you can't hear.

4248
04:24:39,191 --> 04:24:40,361
LIAM: Mup.

4249
04:24:40,361 --> 04:24:42,287
MATT: There's nothing. You are completely
deafened.

4250
04:24:42,287 --> 04:24:43,580
TRAVIS: Deafened?

4251
04:24:43,580 --> 04:24:47,434
MATT: As are you and Pike. However, because you
were previously frightened, you find your muscles

4252
04:24:47,434 --> 04:24:52,468
tense up and you are both paralyzed as well. You
cannot move, you cannot speak, you cannot--

4253
04:24:52,468 --> 04:24:55,891
LIAM: And I'm not afraid, but I'm deaf.

4254
04:24:55,891 --> 04:25:02,497
MATT: You are afraid and deaf. Yeah. All right.
Percy, it's your turn.

4255
04:25:02,497 --> 04:25:08,128
TRAVIS: We've both seen it, we can't say shit.

4256
04:25:08,128 --> 04:25:10,415
SAM: Well, I'm floating to my death, so.

4257
04:25:10,415 --> 04:25:17,208
TALIESIN: Bugger all, I got to fix this shit. Oh,
what a clusterfuck.

4258
04:25:17,208 --> 04:25:21,299
SAM: Don't worry, I still have my lips. (blows
whistle)

4259
04:25:21,299 --> 04:25:24,664
(laughter)

4260
04:25:24,664 --> 04:25:32,496
TALIESIN: Great. Okay. Where is-- can you point to
Vex in that?

4261
04:25:32,496 --> 04:25:34,262
TRAVIS: Wait, didn't I have Freedom of Movement?

4262
04:25:34,262 --> 04:25:38,020
MATT: This is Vex here. You do have Freedom of
Movement. So you are not currently affected by

4263
04:25:38,020 --> 04:25:46,176
paralysis. Look at you, remembering your buffs,
buddy! So the fear still hits you, and your

4264
04:25:46,176 --> 04:25:50,683
muscles tense, but you, looking over at Pike now
frozen in place, you remember everything that's

4265
04:25:50,683 --> 04:25:54,189
transpired and that holy divine energy that she
imbued upon you glows from the inside, and your

4266
04:25:54,189 --> 04:25:56,455
muscles return to you and you're still able to
function.

4267
04:25:56,455 --> 04:25:57,528
TRAVIS: Oh, Pike!

4268
04:25:57,528 --> 04:25:58,491
MATT: Percy, you're up.

4269
04:25:58,491 --> 04:26:00,007
TALIESIN: I'm going to turn around the corner.

4270
04:26:00,007 --> 04:26:01,366
MATT: Around here?

4271
04:26:01,366 --> 04:26:10,473
TALIESIN: Grog, say the bloody words!

4272
04:26:10,473 --> 04:26:13,030
MATT: Make another wisdom saving throw.

4273
04:26:13,030 --> 04:26:15,322
MARISHA: Come on, Grog. Snap out of it.

4274
04:26:15,322 --> 04:26:19,145
TRAVIS: Nine. At a disadvantage.

4275
04:26:19,145 --> 04:26:37,846
TALIESIN: Okay. All right, all right, all right.
What the fuck am I going to do? I am going to hold

4276
04:26:37,846 --> 04:26:40,165
my turn right here.

4277
04:26:40,165 --> 04:26:41,504
MATT: Okay, holding your action.

4278
04:26:41,504 --> 04:26:46,646
TALIESIN: Until such time as someone says the
fucking letters that we need, and I'm going to be

4279
04:26:46,646 --> 04:26:51,379
ready to yell them out.

4280
04:26:51,379 --> 04:26:58,825
MATT: All right, Keyleth. Actually, at the end of
Percy's turn, the sphinx is going to go ahead.

4281
04:26:58,825 --> 04:27:09,486
It's going to use one of its actions to do a claw
attack now against-- this is going to be against

4282
04:27:09,486 --> 04:27:18,123
Pike. That is going to be a 15, which misses. The
claw, even though she's paralyzed-- actually, no,

4283
04:27:18,123 --> 04:27:21,880
he has advantage on the attack because she's
paralyzed. Rolled a one on the second one. Manages

4284
04:27:21,880 --> 04:27:25,256
to hit her, but the armor and the shield takes the
brunt of it, not dealing any physical damage to

4285
04:27:25,256 --> 04:27:30,316
it. There's now frustration in the sphinx's voice
as it's growling with each one of these screams.

4286
04:27:30,316 --> 04:27:31,888
Now it is your turn, Keyleth.

4287
04:27:31,888 --> 04:27:37,752
MARISHA: Okay. Question: as a fire elemental, I
can fly, right?

4288
04:27:37,752 --> 04:27:41,634
MATT: Does it say on the fire elemental? It should
say movement: flight.

4289
04:27:41,634 --> 04:27:48,700
MARISHA: It says that I can, oh, movement? It
doesn't really say, it says I can move through a

4290
04:27:48,700 --> 04:27:51,174
space as narrow as one inch wide without
squeezing.

4291
04:27:51,174 --> 04:27:56,360
MATT: Well, for the elemental form here, which I have
a list of your elemental forms just in case. Fire

4292
04:27:56,360 --> 04:28:01,105
elemental, speed of 50 feet. No, it cannot fly. It
moves as a flame across the ground.

4293
04:28:01,105 --> 04:28:04,688
MARISHA: Can't fly. So if I go into that portal
I'm going to be in the same fucking situation, I'm

4294
04:28:04,688 --> 04:28:05,932
assuming.

4295
04:28:05,932 --> 04:28:08,911
TALIESIN: Sadly, there is only one of us who can
fly, and very busy right now.

4296
04:28:08,911 --> 04:28:13,852
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to drop my elemental
form--

4297
04:28:13,852 --> 04:28:15,084
MATT: Okay.

4298
04:28:15,084 --> 04:28:20,293
MARISHA: You still have my Immovable Rod?

4299
04:28:20,293 --> 04:28:21,992
LAURA: It's planted next to the water.

4300
04:28:21,992 --> 04:28:23,005
MATT: It's over there.

4301
04:28:23,005 --> 04:28:27,127
LAURA: But my rope is attached to it and it's
dangling next to me. I dropped it when I healed

4302
04:28:27,127 --> 04:28:34,447
Pike. So it's right next to me, I pulled the robe
over to there.

4303
04:28:34,447 --> 04:28:40,431
MATT: Yeah, the robe that produces the rope is on
the ground right now next to Vex.

4304
04:28:40,431 --> 04:28:44,451
MARISHA: Okay, before I drop elemental form I'm
going to go pick up the rod.

4305
04:28:44,451 --> 04:28:47,305
MATT: What are you doing?

4306
04:28:47,305 --> 04:28:50,245
MARISHA: It's so I can move faster. Pick up the
rod.

4307
04:28:50,245 --> 04:28:56,668
MATT: 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and then you drop
your form to grab the rope.

4308
04:28:56,668 --> 04:28:58,012
MARISHA: Drop my form.

4309
04:28:58,012 --> 04:29:00,524
MATT: And you're grabbing the what? The rod?

4310
04:29:00,524 --> 04:29:01,605
MARISHA: The Immovable Rod.

4311
04:29:01,605 --> 04:29:04,738
MATT: All right, so you click the rod off. You now
have the rod with the rope on the end of it.

4312
04:29:04,738 --> 04:29:08,638
MARISHA: And do I still have movement now as
myself?

4313
04:29:08,638 --> 04:29:14,068
MATT: No, you-- in dropping the form, you've used
most of-- I'd say you have one more square of

4314
04:29:14,068 --> 04:29:15,494
movement left.

4315
04:29:15,494 --> 04:29:17,279
MARISHA: I'll step forward a square.

4316
04:29:17,279 --> 04:29:18,953
MATT: This way or this way?

4317
04:29:18,953 --> 04:29:24,366
MARISHA: No, the other way. Yeah, yeah. And say,
Vex, catch!

4318
04:29:24,366 --> 04:29:29,991
MATT: Okay, so you throw the Immovable Rod to
her?

4319
04:29:29,991 --> 04:29:31,182
MARISHA: Yeah.

4320
04:29:31,182 --> 04:29:33,927
MATT: Make a dexterity check, easy enough for
you.

4321
04:29:33,927 --> 04:29:40,294
LAURA: 19.

4322
04:29:40,294 --> 04:29:42,075
MATT: Yeah, you catch the rod, no issue.

4323
04:29:42,075 --> 04:29:44,024
LAURA: I know, it was really close.

4324
04:29:44,024 --> 04:29:46,079
MATT: All right. So is that your turn?

4325
04:29:46,079 --> 04:29:47,293
MARISHA: I think so. I think that's all I can do.

4326
04:29:47,293 --> 04:29:50,711
MATT: All right, that ends Keyleth's turn. At the
end of Keyleth's turn it's going to use another

4327
04:29:50,711 --> 04:29:55,861
legendary action. This one, it's going to go ahead
and reach out and strike at you, Vex, as you're

4328
04:29:55,861 --> 04:29:57,030
now holding the rod.

4329
04:29:57,030 --> 04:29:57,954
LAURA: Of course.

4330
04:29:57,954 --> 04:30:02,845
MATT: That's going to be a 29 to hit. You suffer
28 points of slashing damage as its giant claw

4331
04:30:02,845 --> 04:30:06,106
rakes across the front of your body, almost
tossing you off your feet from the sheer force of

4332
04:30:06,106 --> 04:30:07,985
the blow.

4333
04:30:07,985 --> 04:30:09,258
LAURA: 28 points?

4334
04:30:09,258 --> 04:30:11,735
MATT: 28 points. That brings us to Grog.

4335
04:30:11,735 --> 04:30:17,239
TRAVIS: I look down at Pike. Pike, buddy, are you
all right?

4336
04:30:17,239 --> 04:30:20,340
MATT: You've gotten your senses back now at this
point. You look at her, and she's still frozen in

4337
04:30:20,340 --> 04:30:25,212
place. She can't move and you can see the sweat's
still pouring from her face. The wound has stopped

4338
04:30:25,212 --> 04:30:29,336
bleeding, the wound is still fresh and visible.

4339
04:30:29,336 --> 04:30:36,528
TRAVIS: And I call out, the letters inside the
wind are O-R-I.

4340
04:30:36,528 --> 04:30:38,704
MARISHA: O-R-I.

4341
04:30:38,704 --> 04:30:42,207
LAURA: Maljikaori? Maljikairi?

4342
04:30:42,207 --> 04:30:43,507
LIAM: Karimaljika?

4343
04:30:43,507 --> 04:30:45,730
LAURA: Kaorimal?

4344
04:30:45,730 --> 04:30:47,828
MARISHA: Malkaoriji?

4345
04:30:47,828 --> 04:30:51,746
MATT: Anyway. Anyway, before you guys start doing
this whole thing, take your turns to do stuff.

4346
04:30:51,746 --> 04:30:54,230
Grog. What else do you want to do on your turn?

4347
04:30:54,230 --> 04:31:06,971
TRAVIS: I turn, I face the sphinx, and I don't do
anything.

4348
04:31:06,971 --> 04:31:08,472
MATT: Okay.

4349
04:31:08,472 --> 04:31:10,224
TRAVIS: Craven Edge is on the ground, right?

4350
04:31:10,224 --> 04:31:11,739
MATT: Craven Edge is on the ground, yeah.

4351
04:31:11,739 --> 04:31:13,597
TRAVIS: That's it. That's all I do.

4352
04:31:13,597 --> 04:31:18,797
MATT: Okay. Ending Grog's turn, it is Pike's turn.
Pike cannot move, fails the saving throw,

4353
04:31:18,797 --> 04:31:22,584
unfortunately is still paralyzed, still
frightened.

4354
04:31:22,584 --> 04:31:25,166
TALIESIN: I was holding my action for this.

4355
04:31:25,166 --> 04:31:26,524
MATT: Okay, what are you going to do?

4356
04:31:26,524 --> 04:31:30,243
TALIESIN: Maljikaori?

4357
04:31:30,243 --> 04:31:32,941
MATT: No response.

4358
04:31:32,941 --> 04:31:37,262
MARISHA: Hang on, wait, before you move it, before
you move it, put it back, put it back, put it

4359
04:31:37,262 --> 04:31:40,002
back. Okay, I want to write it down.

4360
04:31:40,002 --> 04:31:41,826
TALIESIN: Maorikalji!

4361
04:31:41,826 --> 04:31:43,306
MATT: Nothing.

4362
04:31:43,306 --> 04:31:47,289
LAURA: The order was fire, earth, water, air. That
was the circle. So it could be in any of those

4363
04:31:47,289 --> 04:31:48,666
orders, maybe.

4364
04:31:48,666 --> 04:31:52,927
MATT: You've got one more try before your turn's
up, this is--

4365
04:31:52,927 --> 04:31:54,545
TALIESIN: Malkaoriji!

4366
04:31:54,545 --> 04:32:01,075
MATT: Nope. That is your turn, however. In the six
seconds, you shout out, you come up with and shout

4367
04:32:01,075 --> 04:32:04,294
out those three things. That ends Percy's turn. At
the end of Percy's turn, it's going to use its

4368
04:32:04,294 --> 04:32:12,503
third legendary action to go ahead and make
another strike at Vex holding the rod. 25 to hit.

4369
04:32:12,503 --> 04:32:14,225
LAURA: Yeah.

4370
04:32:14,225 --> 04:32:17,459
MATT: Takes another claw and rakes you for 28
points of slashing damage.

4371
04:32:17,459 --> 04:32:18,746
LAURA: I'm unconscious.

4372
04:32:18,746 --> 04:32:25,791
MATT: Vex falls unconscious on the ground from the
blow, the rod clacks to the ground behind her.

4373
04:32:25,791 --> 04:32:39,852
That ends that turn. All right. Oh shit, I did
that out of order. It's fine. That's my fault.

4374
04:32:39,852 --> 04:32:44,084
Percy shouldn't have got that turn, but we'll say
it happened, it's fine. Vax, you're up.

4375
04:32:44,084 --> 04:32:48,882
LIAM: I'm going to use my bonus action to
disengage from the sphinx and I'm going to run

4376
04:32:48,882 --> 04:32:55,796
around the whirlwind, and as I move I'm taking the
rope which I already made a loop on, and I'm going

4377
04:32:55,796 --> 04:33:02,596
to throw the loop over Grog's head on one end, and
I'm going to jump into the whirlwind holding

4378
04:33:02,596 --> 04:33:05,018
tightly-- I'm going to, into there, I'm going
after Scanlan.

4379
04:33:05,018 --> 04:33:11,132
MATT: The rope clenches onto your neck and you
feel like you're being choked suddenly. Without

4380
04:33:11,132 --> 04:33:15,497
even realizing this, as you shout this out, all of
a sudden a lasso is thrown around your neck and

4381
04:33:15,497 --> 04:33:17,587
pulls back and cuts off your air supply.

4382
04:33:17,587 --> 04:33:19,912
TRAVIS: (chokes) Okay.

4383
04:33:19,912 --> 04:33:25,850
MATT: And you vanish into the cyclone. The rope
goes taut, pulling. You come through the portal

4384
04:33:25,850 --> 04:33:30,239
and you can see, indeed, Scanlan's about 30 feet
away and drifting.

4385
04:33:30,239 --> 04:33:32,569
LIAM: And I was hasted and I ran at the
whirlwind.

4386
04:33:32,569 --> 04:33:36,373
MATT: Right. Which is why you're gaining on him,
but it's still going to take a moment as you're

4387
04:33:36,373 --> 04:33:38,855
both still drifting, because he also leapt through.

4388
04:33:38,855 --> 04:33:43,861
LIAM: It's really quiet in here. But then again it
would be really quiet out of here as well.

4389
04:33:43,861 --> 04:33:48,661
MATT: Yep. All right, so. That's going to be the
end of your turn, Vax. This spider now is going to

4390
04:33:48,661 --> 04:33:58,971
leap over as two more, or sorry, three more leap
out of this. They all rush up to Keyleth, she's

4391
04:33:58,971 --> 04:34:06,219
the one visible person there, and all making
strikes against you. That is 19 to hit.

4392
04:34:06,219 --> 04:34:07,784
MARISHA: Hits.

4393
04:34:07,784 --> 04:34:09,084
MATT: Eight.

4394
04:34:09,084 --> 04:34:10,160
MARISHA: Miss.

4395
04:34:10,160 --> 04:34:11,538
MATT: 23.

4396
04:34:11,538 --> 04:34:12,505
MARISHA: Hits.

4397
04:34:12,505 --> 04:34:14,226
MATT: And ten.

4398
04:34:14,226 --> 04:34:15,232
MARISHA: Miss.

4399
04:34:15,232 --> 04:34:25,121
MATT: All right, so you take 12 points of psychic
damage as two of the spiders dissipate, leaving

4400
04:34:25,121 --> 04:34:32,087
nothing but a psychic mist behind. All right. Top
of the turn, Vex, I need you to make a death

4401
04:34:32,087 --> 04:34:33,773
saving throw.

4402
04:34:33,773 --> 04:34:37,898
LAURA: Six.

4403
04:34:37,898 --> 04:34:43,412
MATT: Six. Mark off one of your failed death
saving throws. Scanlan, your turn, you're floating

4404
04:34:43,412 --> 04:34:48,844
out in space and you see all of a sudden through the
portal, Vax come rocketing towards you, hand

4405
04:34:48,844 --> 04:34:52,959
forward, clutching a rope in one hand, arm
outstretched towards you. What do you want to do?

4406
04:34:52,959 --> 04:34:58,016
SAM: Well, as much as I appreciate the gesture,
I'm going to try to Dimension Door out of here.

4407
04:34:58,016 --> 04:35:05,142
LIAM: I deftly roll my eyes so fucking hard.

4408
04:35:05,142 --> 04:35:10,748
MATT: You Dimension Door and you appear right at
the doorway. You cannot Dimension Door through

4409
04:35:10,748 --> 04:35:16,065
dimensions. But you make your way to the outside
of the door. You are still drifting with the

4410
04:35:16,065 --> 04:35:20,137
momentum you had going backwards, so you appear
back at the door and start going backwards again.

4411
04:35:20,137 --> 04:35:21,316
SAM: Can I grab the door?

4412
04:35:21,316 --> 04:35:22,628
MATT: You can grab the rope.

4413
04:35:22,628 --> 04:35:26,252
LIAM: I don't see or hear him, so I assume he is
healing my sister right now, and I feel

4414
04:35:26,252 --> 04:35:27,304
comforted.

4415
04:35:27,304 --> 04:35:30,894
MATT: You see him vanish. There's the rope there
that Vax is carrying. You can grab onto that and

4416
04:35:30,894 --> 04:35:37,838
wrestle through. With that, Scanlan manages to
pull himself through the portal, landing onto the

4417
04:35:37,838 --> 04:35:43,571
side right there. And you're fine now. That's
probably going to take your full action,

4418
04:35:43,571 --> 04:35:44,966
everything to get there, but you're out--

4419
04:35:44,966 --> 04:35:46,208
SAM: Bonus too?

4420
04:35:46,208 --> 04:35:48,927
MATT: I'll give you a bonus, sure, because your
movement.

4421
04:35:48,927 --> 04:35:51,230
SAM: All right. Do I have time to assess and see
that she's dead?

4422
04:35:51,230 --> 04:35:53,181
MATT: She's doing pretty rough, yeah.

4423
04:35:53,181 --> 04:35:54,367
SAM: I will heal her.

4424
04:35:54,367 --> 04:35:55,500
MATT: All right. Healing Word.

4425
04:35:55,500 --> 04:35:57,297
SAM: Healing Word at level--

4426
04:35:57,297 --> 04:35:58,549
MATT: What level are you doing?

4427
04:35:58,549 --> 04:36:02,892
SAM: I don't have many levels. At level three.

4428
04:36:02,892 --> 04:36:09,165
MATT: Okay. So that's 3d4 plus five.

4429
04:36:09,165 --> 04:36:10,389
SAM: I roll?

4430
04:36:10,389 --> 04:36:14,509
MATT: Yes. 3d4 plus five. Finishing up Scanlan's
turn--

4431
04:36:14,509 --> 04:36:17,324
SAM: 11.

4432
04:36:17,324 --> 04:36:24,145
LAURA: Hey, it's better than zero. Thank you. I'm
alive!

4433
04:36:24,145 --> 04:36:30,153
MATT: All right. I need everybody in the room to
roll another constitution saving throw.

4434
04:36:30,153 --> 04:36:31,738
LAURA: (laughs) Oh no.

4435
04:36:31,738 --> 04:36:33,898
MATT: Except for you, you're not in the room.

4436
04:36:33,898 --> 04:36:37,931
LAURA: This aging thing, is it permanent forever?

4437
04:36:37,931 --> 04:36:39,294
SAM: We'll find out later.

4438
04:36:39,294 --> 04:36:42,317
MARISHA: Maybe if we ask nicely, he'll make us
young again.

4439
04:36:42,317 --> 04:36:44,254
LIAM: I probably look really good with ten years
on me.

4440
04:36:44,254 --> 04:36:46,658
TRAVIS: 16.

4441
04:36:46,658 --> 04:36:48,935
LAURA: Nine.

4442
04:36:48,935 --> 04:36:50,632
LIAM: I'm not here.

4443
04:36:50,632 --> 04:36:51,914
MATT: Oh, sorry. Keyleth?

4444
04:36:51,914 --> 04:36:53,512
MARISHA: 17.

4445
04:36:53,512 --> 04:36:54,901
MATT: Pike succeeds. 17.

4446
04:36:54,901 --> 04:36:55,755
TALIESIN: 24.

4447
04:36:55,755 --> 04:36:56,715
SAM: 21.

4448
04:36:56,715 --> 04:36:57,729
MATT: 21. All right. So.

4449
04:36:57,729 --> 04:36:58,842
SAM: Do I also have to roll for fear?

4450
04:36:58,842 --> 04:37:03,443
MATT: At the end of your turn you would, yes.
Actually, no, I think that's gone off of you now.

4451
04:37:03,443 --> 04:37:15,109
It's fine. So Vex, you come to consciousness, and
you age another four years.

4452
04:37:15,109 --> 04:37:17,858
LIAM: Aw, he softballed you with that one.

4453
04:37:17,858 --> 04:37:22,944
MATT: I rolled a four. It's a d20 every time.
Yeah.

4454
04:37:22,944 --> 04:37:24,897
MARISHA: Shit.

4455
04:37:24,897 --> 04:37:27,905
TALIESIN: You basically just got Netflix, that's
really all that happened.

4456
04:37:27,905 --> 04:37:31,052
MATT: It is now the sphinx's turn.

4457
04:37:31,052 --> 04:37:38,648
TRAVIS: We're all laughing and one of us is
unconscious.

4458
04:37:38,648 --> 04:37:40,524
LAURA: We're seriously going to die.

4459
04:37:40,524 --> 04:37:42,033
TALIESIN: We're not going to die, we're doing
great.

4460
04:37:42,033 --> 04:37:43,209
MARISHA: We're doing all right.

4461
04:37:43,209 --> 04:37:53,196
MATT: There. Next to Scanlan and Percy, two claw
attacks against you. That is a 28. And 21.

4462
04:37:53,196 --> 04:38:03,706
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my shield to glance off 
the 21. I'm going to use the shield of plus five AC.

4463
04:38:03,706 --> 04:38:07,477
MATT: Okay. Which reduces it to a--

4464
04:38:07,477 --> 04:38:11,855
TALIESIN: Versus AC of 23. It gives me a temporary
AC of 23.

4465
04:38:11,855 --> 04:38:14,879
MATT: Right, so the second one would miss. So the
first strike hits you for 28 points of slashing

4466
04:38:14,879 --> 04:38:20,631
damage, the second one scrapes across the arcane
barrier that appears before you from the brooch,

4467
04:38:20,631 --> 04:38:27,962
and resist that. That's the end of its turn.
Percy, you got your turn last turn when you

4468
04:38:27,962 --> 04:38:29,310
shouldn't have, but I'm letting that fly--

4469
04:38:29,310 --> 04:38:30,499
TALIESIN: No, because I was holding my--

4470
04:38:30,499 --> 04:38:31,673
MATT: Oh sorry, you were holding it, yes.

4471
04:38:31,673 --> 04:38:32,831
TALIESIN: It's all part of the plan.

4472
04:38:32,831 --> 04:38:34,419
MATT: I confused myself. So yeah. Now it's your
turn.

4473
04:38:34,419 --> 04:38:36,223
TALIESIN: I said Jamalkaori last time, if I
recall.

4474
04:38:36,223 --> 04:38:37,280
MATT: You did.

4475
04:38:37,280 --> 04:38:42,602
TALIESIN: Kaorijimal.

4476
04:38:42,602 --> 04:38:44,732
MATT: Nothing.

4477
04:38:44,732 --> 04:38:51,386
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to, while I'm
saying all these things I'm going to be running

4478
04:38:51,386 --> 04:38:58,625
around the corner back towards the spiderweb. Make
another one.

4479
04:38:58,625 --> 04:39:01,940
MATT: What have you said so far?

4480
04:39:01,940 --> 04:39:03,547
TALIESIN: We said, Maljikaori--

4481
04:39:03,547 --> 04:39:05,913
MARISHA: Maorikaji.

4482
04:39:05,913 --> 04:39:09,983
TALIESIN: Jimalkaori.

4483
04:39:09,983 --> 04:39:11,771
MARISHA: And Kaorijimal.

4484
04:39:11,771 --> 04:39:15,005
MATT: Right, okay. So. You have two more if you
wanted to do anything, Taliesin.

4485
04:39:15,005 --> 04:39:18,747
MARISHA: You should try that one.

4486
04:39:18,747 --> 04:39:20,901
TALIESIN: Is that as far as I can move right now?

4487
04:39:20,901 --> 04:39:22,867
MATT: You can move up to there, I think.

4488
04:39:22,867 --> 04:39:25,576
TALIESIN: Okay, I can't get any closer to the
web?

4489
04:39:25,576 --> 04:39:30,612
MATT: Not for your full movement, unfortunately.

4490
04:39:30,612 --> 04:39:37,225
TALIESIN: Kamaljiori?

4491
04:39:37,225 --> 04:39:47,704
MATT: At this point, all of a sudden the braziers
flicker out. You notice as the wind cyclone begins

4492
04:39:47,704 --> 04:39:57,696
to slowly drift to a minor wind curl. At this
point in time, Grog, if you wanted to pull on that

4493
04:39:57,696 --> 04:39:59,448
rope it would be a good time.

4494
04:39:59,448 --> 04:40:04,046
TRAVIS: Yeah, I turn around and grab the thing
that's strangling my neck like a dog leash and I

4495
04:40:04,046 --> 04:40:06,080
yank it in real hard.

4496
04:40:06,080 --> 04:40:09,614
MATT: With that, you, as you're drifting off, you
turn around and see the doorway where the rope

4497
04:40:09,614 --> 04:40:12,984
goes taut, and the door begins to close.

4498
04:40:12,984 --> 04:40:14,400
LIAM: Bye, guys.

4499
04:40:14,400 --> 04:40:18,430
MATT: You're pulling yourself in, and suddenly
you're yanked through and come shooting out of it

4500
04:40:18,430 --> 04:40:22,057
on the side. With that--

4501
04:40:22,057 --> 04:40:23,589
LIAM: I can't hear you.

4502
04:40:23,589 --> 04:40:28,584
MATT: --the angry demeanor of the sphinx has
entirely shifted. And now it goes from like this

4503
04:40:28,584 --> 04:40:36,480
low, feral position to a proud, honored beast,
putting its paws forward, its shoulders high.

4504
04:40:36,480 --> 04:40:41,216
"You have earned a name."

4505
04:40:41,216 --> 04:40:42,935
LIAM: What did you say?

4506
04:40:42,935 --> 04:40:44,527
SAM: Oh yeah, they're deaf.

4507
04:40:44,527 --> 04:40:48,959
MATT: It raises a paw like this, at which point
all the paralysis fades, all the fear fades, all

4508
04:40:48,959 --> 04:40:50,594
the effects fade.

4509
04:40:50,594 --> 04:40:51,957
MARISHA: Are we young again?

4510
04:40:51,957 --> 04:40:55,820
MATT: The age is not dispersed.

4511
04:40:55,820 --> 04:40:59,994
SAM: Ever?

4512
04:40:59,994 --> 04:41:09,360
MATT: Hold on a second, let me see what it can do.
Actually, no. It goes forward and looks at you,

4513
04:41:09,360 --> 04:41:15,882
who's looking the worst for wear comparatively and
says, "I can help but one of you." And his paw

4514
04:41:15,882 --> 04:41:20,676
goes out and touches you, there's a warm glow, and
the age vanishes from you. "However, that is the

4515
04:41:20,676 --> 04:41:30,354
"extent of my magic this day. Perhaps the little
one could help a few at this. It is but a rather

4516
04:41:30,354 --> 04:41:36,651
"challenging restoration." Pike nods. "I can do
that. I can do that."

4517
04:41:36,651 --> 04:41:42,731
LAURA: I look at Vax and laugh at him because he's
so much older than I am.

4518
04:41:42,731 --> 04:41:50,207
MARISHA: That's true, oh my god, you guys are
never going to experience this ever again.

4519
04:41:50,207 --> 04:41:57,863
MATT: "I apologize for the formalities, but it is
a pleasure to meet you, Vox Machina."

4520
04:41:57,863 --> 04:42:01,994
TALIESIN: Hello.

4521
04:42:01,994 --> 04:42:03,057
MARISHA: Hi.

4522
04:42:03,057 --> 04:42:04,116
LAURA: You too.

4523
04:42:04,116 --> 04:42:05,794
SAM: What was his name again?

4524
04:42:05,794 --> 04:42:08,228
MATT: "Kamaljiori."

4525
04:42:08,228 --> 04:42:15,686
LIAM: Hahaha, good one, that was a good one.
Hazing. Who doesn't love hazing, right?

4526
04:42:15,686 --> 04:42:23,352
MARISHA: At about that time, I lift up my shoulder
and I show him the Slayer's Take symbol.

4527
04:42:23,352 --> 04:42:24,629
MATT: He gives a nod.

4528
04:42:24,629 --> 04:42:27,102
SAM: Don't we get something out of this?

4529
04:42:27,102 --> 04:42:39,046
MATT: Looks to you and says, "I admire your
impatience. The Vestiges that you seek. Some have

4530
04:42:39,046 --> 04:42:47,667
"been destroyed over this epoch. Others lie
scattered across the planes. Some are sealed or

4531
04:42:47,667 --> 04:43:00,873
"hidden. Others have found an owner. You carry one
now, I see." The sphinx backs up and turns around

4532
04:43:00,873 --> 04:43:07,019
on the steps and lays down, crossing its paws,
glancing at you all, shoulders high. And a smile,

4533
04:43:07,019 --> 04:43:19,476
it's warm, it's this interesting contrast to when
you first entered. "Well. I happen to carry a

4534
04:43:19,476 --> 04:43:22,762
"Vestige here, if you will take it."

4535
04:43:22,762 --> 04:43:27,237
SAM: I mean, sure, if you're getting rid of it
anyway.

4536
04:43:27,237 --> 04:43:29,169
TALIESIN: It is most gracious of you.

4537
04:43:29,169 --> 04:43:35,383
MATT: Gets up and turns around to the back of the
platform. Takes the marble from beneath its fur

4538
04:43:35,383 --> 04:43:40,973
and holds it up to one of the doorways, which
switches--

4539
04:43:40,973 --> 04:43:42,834
SAM: What?

4540
04:43:42,834 --> 04:43:45,594
LIAM: Dwarven Forge.

4541
04:43:45,594 --> 04:43:47,398
LAURA: Secret doors.

4542
04:43:47,398 --> 04:43:58,216
MATT: It pulls something from within (shing), and
you see this single thin blade that vibrates as he

4543
04:43:58,216 --> 04:44:04,983
pulls it out. The door closes, it puts the marble
away. The blade goes into its teeth, and it steps

4544
04:44:04,983 --> 04:44:11,992
back down the stairs. Takes the blade from its
hand as it stops, and holds it out. It's

4545
04:44:11,992 --> 04:44:21,730
impossibly small in its hand, it looks very dinky.
"Here I keep the Mythcarver."

4546
04:44:21,730 --> 04:44:23,820
MARISHA: Mythcarver?

4547
04:44:23,820 --> 04:44:32,994
MATT: "Granted to me by the White Duke himself
before his passing. We were friends long ago. It

4548
04:44:32,994 --> 04:44:37,539
"is yours." He takes the blade and sets it down on
the stone.

4549
04:44:37,539 --> 04:44:42,662
"But you seek the others that remain, yes?"

4550
04:44:42,662 --> 04:44:44,227
SAM: Yes, yes.

4551
04:44:44,227 --> 04:44:45,933
TALIESIN: Very much so.

4552
04:44:45,933 --> 04:44:59,917
MATT: "Fenthras, the Wrath of the Feywarden, a bow
that felled Titans. It was lost in the Feywild in

4553
04:44:59,917 --> 04:45:01,529
"the Calamity."

4554
04:45:01,529 --> 04:45:02,923
LIAM: Obviously for Scanlan.

4555
04:45:02,923 --> 04:45:04,259
LAURA: Obviously.

4556
04:45:04,259 --> 04:45:16,490
MATT: "It now acts as the heart of a cancerous tree,
corrupting the verdant land there. The Plate of

4557

"Brass, a trophy won by a fire giant in a card game
from a Suutan bloodline that once donned it."

4559
04:45:34,385 --> 04:45:36,152
MARISHA: What was that called again?

4560
04:45:36,152 --> 04:45:38,845
MATT: Don't worry, I wrote all these down for you
guys.

4561
04:45:38,845 --> 04:45:43,262
LAURA: Oh, thank you. I know, I'm like, there's
going to be a test later!

4562
04:45:43,262 --> 04:45:50,581
MATT: I know. I got this for you guys. "Cabal's
Ruin, a magic-devouring cloak once used by an

owner, by a goristro named Yenk in the endless

"maze of the Abyss."

4567
04:46:20,168 --> 04:46:22,426
SAM: Let's go there!

4568
04:46:22,426 --> 04:46:28,890
MATT: "The Titanstone Knuckles were taken from the
brutalized corpse of their proud owner, now worn

4569
04:46:28,890 --> 04:46:36,557

"taste your fear from here. Whisper, blade forged
from metal pulled from the Far Realm, was a center

4571
04:46:48,261 --> 04:46:57,135
"to many a dark ritual. It now lies at the bottom
of the Ozmit Sea, sunken with the lost ship, The

"Shrew, in a storm 300 years ago near an island of
glass.

4573
04:47:02,819 --> 04:47:16,075
"Know that all life is connected on an impossibly
small level, beyond the mind's ability to

4574
04:47:16,075 --> 04:47:30,262
"understand on your level. Ideas transcend
distance, language. Many share dreams, thoughts,

4575
04:47:30,262 --> 04:47:41,007
"inspirations without knowing. The fact that you
are now aware of these, others too may now be

4576
04:47:41,007 --> 04:47:55,162
"drawn to the search as well. Beware. Now go. You
have earned the name, you have earned the knowledge.

4577
04:47:55,162 --> 04:48:00,361
"The race is on."

4578
04:48:00,361 --> 04:48:10,215
And with that, sand begins to erupt from the two
piles of rubble, swirling in a giant whirlwind of

4579
04:48:10,215 --> 04:48:15,534
blasted stone and sand, you guys have to cover
your eyes as it begins to completely consume the

4580
04:48:15,534 --> 04:48:22,280
vision around you. You see the sphinx back up
towards the top of the platform before the sand

4581
04:48:22,280 --> 04:48:28,970
consumes even within 15 feet, ten feet, five feet
of your vision. You lose sight of your friends

4582
04:48:28,970 --> 04:48:34,846
around you, and for a second the panic hits you
before the sand comes to a stop and drops to the

4583
04:48:34,846 --> 04:48:42,754
ground. Looking around, you stand at the base of
the triangular cavern entrance by the mountain

4584
04:48:42,754 --> 04:48:47,907
range where you first entered the temple. And
that's where we'll end tonight's game.

4585
04:48:47,907 --> 04:48:50,789
TRAVIS: Fucking shit.

4586
04:48:50,789 --> 04:48:55,469
LAURA: That got so much more intense than I ever
thought it was going to.

4587
04:48:55,469 --> 04:48:58,768
TRAVIS: I thought it was going to be like a gentle
education, like a gentle ribbing.

4588
04:48:58,768 --> 04:49:00,734
LAURA: Yeah, I thought we'd go and talk to this
guy.

4589
04:49:00,734 --> 04:49:04,108
LIAM: Hey, we're friends with your girlfriend,
want to give us some stuff?

4590
04:49:04,108 --> 04:49:06,025
TRAVIS: Matt, that was--

4591
04:49:06,025 --> 04:49:08,195
MATT: Well done, guys!

4592
04:49:08,195 --> 04:49:10,305
TRAVIS: A crazy-ass puzzle.

4593
04:49:10,305 --> 04:49:13,393
MARISHA: We can look at that list, so I can make
some serious notes?

4594
04:49:13,393 --> 04:49:14,807
MATT: Yeah. There's a list for you guys.

4595
04:49:14,807 --> 04:49:16,557
TRAVIS: I'll make a copy of it, I'll make a copy
of it.

4596
04:49:16,557 --> 04:49:21,477
LAURA: Do we need to go after all of them? We'll
do it; we'll talk about it later.

4597
04:49:21,477 --> 04:49:27,630
MARISHA: I think we each need to be outfitted with
something. We need our legendary weapons, you guys.

4598
04:49:27,630 --> 04:49:31,442
LAURA: We took the weapon off the ground before he
portaled us out, right, Matt?

4599
04:49:31,442 --> 04:49:34,882
MATT: Yes, actually. In which case I will give
this to you as you now have access to its

4600
04:49:34,882 --> 04:49:36,386
capabilities.

4601
04:49:36,386 --> 04:49:38,045
MARISHA: Fenthras? Is that what it was-- no.

4602
04:49:38,045 --> 04:49:43,307
MATT: No, the Mythcarver. It's a legendary
longsword. This incredible silvered blade once

4603
04:49:43,307 --> 04:49:48,525
belonged to the White Duke himself, and many more
master bards before him. It resonates with nearby

4604
04:49:48,525 --> 04:49:54,352
musical tones. It acts as a plus three longsword,
and the weapon deals an additional 1d6 force

4605
04:49:54,352 --> 04:49:59,499
damage upon a hit. Whenever you use your Bardic
Inspiration feature, you gain advantage on attacks

4606
04:49:59,499 --> 04:50:01,427
with this weapon until the end of your turn.

4607
04:50:01,427 --> 04:50:03,491
TRAVIS: Advantage on attacks?

4608
04:50:03,491 --> 04:50:07,464
MATT: So if you were to give somebody-- use your
bonus action before your attack, you would get

4609
04:50:07,464 --> 04:50:09,296
advantage on any attacks with the weapon.

4610
04:50:09,296 --> 04:50:10,982
LIAM: Percy, that was made for you.

4611
04:50:10,982 --> 04:50:12,869
TALIESIN: I know, obviously. I'm so excited.

4612
04:50:12,869 --> 04:50:17,167
MATT: And whenever you use your Cutting Words
feature against an enemy, the target also has

4613
04:50:17,167 --> 04:50:18,799
disadvantage on its next saving throw.

4614
04:50:18,799 --> 04:50:20,126
LAURA: Wow!

4615
04:50:20,126 --> 04:50:22,016
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

4616
04:50:22,016 --> 04:50:24,253
SAM: Well, I guess I'll have to take it.

4617
04:50:24,253 --> 04:50:31,026
TALIESIN: I've got a weird question I'm going to
throw out there. Did you pick your sword back up

4618
04:50:31,026 --> 04:50:32,788
before all this mess happened?

4619
04:50:32,788 --> 04:50:35,020
TRAVIS: Yep.

4620

SAM: Hey, the White Duke!

4621
04:50:37,221 --> 04:50:42,054
MATT: As Grog looks at his feet, the blade that
still laid there before you, tethered to you by

4622
04:50:42,054 --> 04:50:45,278
chain, still remains at your feet as you see the
chain amongst the sand.

4623
04:50:45,278 --> 04:50:47,246
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

4624
04:50:47,246 --> 04:50:56,371
MATT: Still jagged, still extended, still in its
full form. All right. So. Well done, everyone.

4625
04:50:56,371 --> 04:51:01,792
We'll pick this up next week for the 50th episode,
so excited.

4629
04:51:07,807 --> 04:51:10,200
MATT: I know it was long, I wanted to try and get
through this before we started the 50th.

4630
04:51:10,200 --> 04:51:13,156
MARISHA: Oh my god, it's midnight.
