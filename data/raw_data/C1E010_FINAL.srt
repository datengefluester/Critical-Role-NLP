00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,854
MATT: Welcome, everyone, to this 
Thursday's episode of Critical Role,

2
00:00:02,854 --> 00:00:06,485
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors
get together and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

3
00:00:06,485 --> 00:00:11,408
This will be our 10th episode, I think, 
which is awesome.

4
00:00:11,408 --> 00:00:14,676
For all the classic folks
that have been coming every week,

5
00:00:14,676 --> 00:00:17,143
good to see you again; for a bunch 
of newcomers out there as well,

6
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:19,338
welcome and thank you.
I hope you enjoy.

7
00:00:19,338 --> 00:00:22,097
We're going to cut to some videos here.
Probably the last time

8
00:00:22,097 --> 00:00:25,474
that we run the character backstories
at the start of the show.

9
00:00:25,474 --> 00:00:28,815
We usually use it
as partially a stall method

10
00:00:28,815 --> 00:00:31,273
when some of our players
haven't gotten here on time.

11
00:00:31,273 --> 00:00:34,716
(clears throat) i.e., Scanlan.
But he's on his way, I'm sure.

12
00:00:34,716 --> 00:00:36,971
But also since we have
a lot of new people watching,

13
00:00:36,971 --> 00:00:38,740
and we figured it would be cool
for them to actually get an idea

14
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,645
of the character backgrounds, as well, 
but going forward,

15
00:00:40,645 --> 00:00:43,572
we'll just be playing them
for the intermission break.

16
00:00:43,572 --> 00:00:46,162
So we'll be back here
in about 10 minutes or so.

17
00:00:46,162 --> 00:00:48,974
In the meantime,
enjoy the character backstories.

18
00:00:48,974 --> 00:00:51,217
We'll see you guys in just a moment.

19
00:00:51,847 --> 00:01:55,852
[dramatic music]

20
00:01:59,934 --> 00:02:02,228
ASHLEY: Pike grew up 
on the outskirts of town,

21
00:02:02,228 --> 00:02:03,852
near the Bramblewood.

22
00:02:03,852 --> 00:02:06,129
Her ancestors 
were a family of deep gnomes

23
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:08,758
with quite an unfavorable reputation.

24
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,216
Thievery, destruction, and trickery

25
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:14,931
left them with the curse 
of the last name Trickfoot.

26
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:17,875
Sarenrae, 
the goddess of healing and redemption,

27
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:21,336
had other plans for Pike's 
great-great-grandfather Wilhand,

28
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:24,602
who left his family at a young age
after a dream,

29
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:28,654
a dream that changed the course 
of the Trickfoot family.

30
00:02:28,654 --> 00:02:32,319
Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae
and pledged from then on

31
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,779
that him and his family
would live a life of service and devotion.

32
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:40,584
As a child, 
Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal.

33
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:44,489
Whether it was animals, people, 
or even flowers,

34
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:47,396
she felt she had a purpose 
in making things whole

35
00:02:47,396 --> 00:02:48,969
that had once been broken.

36
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:52,573
She studied and learned 
the ways to heal though divine magic.

37
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:56,129
She lived a peaceful life, 
quiet and simple,

38
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:59,702
until one day, 
Wilhand was captured and almost killed

39
00:02:59,702 --> 00:03:02,221
by a group of goliath barbarians.

40
00:03:02,221 --> 00:03:05,619
One of the goliaths took a stand
against the murder of the innocent gnome

41
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:10,984
and he himself was beaten, bloodied, 
and left for dead, abandoned by his herd.

42
00:03:10,984 --> 00:03:13,853
Wilhand went to Pike for help.

43
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:16,960
She prayed and healed this barbarian
as best she could,

44
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,984
bringing him back to life.

45
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:24,865
When he awoke, she discovered 
his name was Grog Strongjaw.

46
00:03:24,865 --> 00:03:29,608
After that, they were best of friends,
a rather unlikely pair.

47
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:32,911
Little did she know 
that in a few years' time,

48
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:35,187
Grog would soon return the favor

49
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:37,607
and bring her back 
from the clutches of death.

50
00:03:37,607 --> 00:03:39,877
(roar, crunch)

51
00:03:39,877 --> 00:03:44,060
After being killed in battle, 
Pike felt angry.

52
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,512
She wanted to be stronger
so that it would never happen again.

53
00:03:47,512 --> 00:03:50,146
She spent four months at sea

54
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:54,003
training with the men and women
aboard a ship called the Broken Howl.

55
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:58,430
Gripping her holy symbol in one hand,
and her morningstar in the other,

56
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,623
this time, Pike is ready.

57
00:04:03,163 --> 00:04:04,972
TRAVIS: Right, Listen up!

58
00:04:04,972 --> 00:04:10,163
If you have ale, 
then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw.

59
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:13,589
A goliath of towering height and size,

60
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:19,135
this barbarian has an appetite 
for the two great loves in his life:

61
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:22,606
combat, women, and ale! (chuckle)

62
00:04:22,606 --> 00:04:24,763
(record scratch) Wait.

63
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:29,014
Easily the brains of the group, 
Grog is often consulted

64
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:34,621
for his vast knowledge of shapes, 
colors, and (chuckle) shiny things!

65
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:36,560
Also ale.

66
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,426
In his early years, 
armed with his two-handed great axe,

67
00:04:40,426 --> 00:04:42,953
Grog often enjoyed proving his might

68
00:04:42,953 --> 00:04:46,385
amongst the ranks 
of his family's wandering herd.

69
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:50,637
But after coming upon an unsuspecting 
elderly gnome in the woods,

70
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:55,042
he objected to the killing 
of such an innocent life.

71
00:04:55,042 --> 00:05:00,024
A creature of impulse, 
Grog felt only pity for this--

72
00:05:00,024 --> 00:05:03,011
well, this terrified little thing.

73
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:06,370
And his disobedience cost him dearly.

74
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:11,556
Beaten bloody and banished 
by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak,

75
00:05:11,556 --> 00:05:14,753
Grog was abandoned and left to die.

76
00:05:14,753 --> 00:05:16,699
Exiled from his herd,

77
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:21,707
it was then that the relative 
of the very gnome he fought to save,

78
00:05:21,707 --> 00:05:24,068
saved him.

79
00:05:24,068 --> 00:05:26,917
It was the kindness 
of a gnome cleric named Pike

80
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:31,145
that healed Grog, 
bringing him back from death's edge.

81
00:05:31,145 --> 00:05:34,896
And they have remained close friends 
ever since.

82
00:05:34,896 --> 00:05:36,867
Most nights, Grog can be found

83
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:41,552
challenging entire taverns 
to wrestling matches! Ha!

84
00:05:41,552 --> 00:05:44,711
or accompanying Scanlan 
to the nearest house

85
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,814
where you pay forÂ… lady favors.

86
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,944
Also ale!

87
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:53,094
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth

88
00:05:53,094 --> 00:05:55,749
would leave you with little information
on the half-elven druid.

89
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:58,638
You might even think 
that her social awkwardness

90
00:05:58,638 --> 00:06:02,083
due to her sheltered upbringing 
is kind of sweet. (chuckle)

91
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:05,759
Of course, it would be unwise 
to underestimate her

92
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,138
based on first impressions.
(thunder)

93
00:06:08,138 --> 00:06:10,888
Under that unintimidating petite frame

94
00:06:10,888 --> 00:06:13,671
is a vicious beast 
waiting to be unleashed,

95
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:16,580
whose natural powers
have made even the fiercest of champions

96
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,687
pee their pants, literally! (soft chuckle)

97
00:06:19,687 --> 00:06:23,028
Born to the Air Tribe 
of the Ashari people,

98
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:27,584
Keyleth was raised with a deep love
of nature and the elemental magics.

99
00:06:27,584 --> 00:06:29,503
It is her people's inherent duty

100
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:32,572
to protect 
the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

101
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:36,070
where the four elemental planes 
begin to bleed with this realm.

102
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,710
Since she was a little girl, 
she had quite a knack

103
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,655
for air manipulation 
and beast shaping abilities.

104
00:06:41,655 --> 00:06:46,424
Well, if you consider kittens and 
flying squirrels to be little beasts.

105
00:06:46,424 --> 00:06:48,732
Which, I do. (clears throat)

106
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:51,972
Anyways, it wasn't long 
before the headmaster of the tribe,

107
00:06:51,972 --> 00:06:56,021
her father, Korren,
realized her true prodigious abilities

108
00:06:56,021 --> 00:07:00,114
and she was inveterated 
to succeed him as the next headmaster.

109
00:07:00,114 --> 00:07:03,761
Just like that, 
her jovial childhood was stripped

110
00:07:03,761 --> 00:07:05,856
and replaced 
with endless spell memorization,

111
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:10,419
teachings from ancient traditions, 
and exceedingly high expectations.

112
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:11,768
Every druid leader to be

113
00:07:11,768 --> 00:07:15,315
must embark on journey 
to seek out the sister tribes

114
00:07:15,315 --> 00:07:17,666
in order to introduce 
and establish respect

115
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,128
amongst the fellow headmasters.

116
00:07:20,128 --> 00:07:23,814
They call this the AraMente, 
or Noble Odyssey.

117
00:07:23,814 --> 00:07:25,699
When her father felt she was ready,

118
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:28,846
he set her on the path 
to truly discovering herself,

119
00:07:28,846 --> 00:07:32,533
not knowing when, or if, 
she will ever return.

120
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:34,785
As she hiked down the mountain 
towards Stillben,

121
00:07:34,785 --> 00:07:37,860
she meditated on the task ahead.

122
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,953
Part of the AraMente

123
00:07:38,953 --> 00:07:43,168
is proving yourself a strong warrior, 
a valiant protector,

124
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:45,714
and a wise and compassionate leader.

125
00:07:45,714 --> 00:07:49,929
With this knowledge, 
one thought plays on repeat in her mind:

126
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:52,741
Is she even worthy?

127
00:07:54,701 --> 00:07:57,067
TALIESIN: Percy was the third
of seven children,

128
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:59,906
born to a noble family who lived 
far to the north

129
00:07:59,906 --> 00:08:02,345
in the ancient castle of Whitestone.

130
00:08:02,345 --> 00:08:05,038
With so many siblings 
to share the burdens of lordship,

131
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:06,645
Percy turned his attentions

132
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:10,624
to the sciences, 
engineering, and naturalism.

133
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:15,725
One day, a mysterious couple named 
Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court.

134
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:17,574
During a feast held in their honor,

135
00:08:17,574 --> 00:08:20,563
the Briarwoods violently 
took control of the castle,

136
00:08:20,563 --> 00:08:23,875
killing or imprisoning 
everyone who would stand in their way.

137
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:29,565
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, 
only to be freed by his younger sister.

138
00:08:29,565 --> 00:08:32,443
Together they fled, 
chased by the Briarwoods' men.

139
00:08:32,443 --> 00:08:37,715
As they ran, Percy's sister took 
several arrows to the chest and fell.

140
00:08:37,715 --> 00:08:39,025
Percy kept running,

141
00:08:39,025 --> 00:08:43,414
eventually jumping into a freezing river 
and floating unconscious to freedom.

142
00:08:43,414 --> 00:08:46,391
He did not remember 
waking up on a fishing boat.

143
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:49,065
He barely remembered 
the next two years,

144
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:52,709
as he slowly made his way 
as far south as possible.

145
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:55,880
Then one night, Percy had a dream.

146
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,799
A roaring cloud of smoke 
offered him vengeance

147
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,603
against those who destroyed his family.

148
00:09:01,603 --> 00:09:05,920
When he awoke, 
Percy began to design his first gun.

149
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,465
(gunshot)

150
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:11,666
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard 
of Scanlan Shorthalt?

151
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:15,147
Well, gird your loins, ladies, 
because he has his eye on you.

152
00:09:15,147 --> 00:09:20,298
A talented musician, master of disguise,
and dashingly handsome in his own mind,

153
00:09:20,298 --> 00:09:25,197
Scanlan sings songs almost as much 
as he sings his own praises.

154
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:28,625
Born a poor gnome, 
Scanlan used his endless charm

155
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:32,855
and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin 
and support his single mother.

156
00:09:32,855 --> 00:09:35,514
One day he was discovered 
by a half-orc promoter,

157
00:09:35,514 --> 00:09:39,389
and joined Dr. Dranzel's 
Spectacular Traveling Troupe,

158
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:41,152
where he learned the ways of the world,

159
00:09:41,152 --> 00:09:45,403
and honed his skills 
as a bard extraordinaire.

160
00:09:45,403 --> 00:09:49,027
A loner much of his life, 
Scanlan has never quite come to terms

161
00:09:49,027 --> 00:09:53,052
with the violent death of his mother 
at the hands of a goblin invasion.

162
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:56,156
While his years on the road 
provided many, shall we say,

163
00:09:56,156 --> 00:09:59,488
educational experiences 
with the opposite sex,

164
00:09:59,488 --> 00:10:03,351
deep down, Scanlan yearns 
for the one thing he's never known:

165
00:10:03,351 --> 00:10:06,139
the true love of a fellow gnome.

166
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:10,775
Still, Scanlan considers himself 
a lover first, performer second,

167
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:13,231
and fighter distant third.

168
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:16,117
On the battlefield, 
he'll support his allies,

169
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:17,769
but rarely draws blood,

170
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:20,724
unless it's to protect 
fellow gnome, Pike.

171
00:10:20,724 --> 00:10:23,660
Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, 
a rollicking song,

172
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,254
and a twinkle in his eye

173
00:10:25,254 --> 00:10:28,452
that melts hearts 
and makes the females swoon.

174
00:10:30,522 --> 00:10:35,815
ORION: Greetings and salutations. 
I am Tiberius Stormwind.

175
00:10:35,815 --> 00:10:40,047
I hail from a town called Ty'rex, 
located in the heart of Draconia.

176
00:10:40,047 --> 00:10:42,529
From a politically respected family,

177
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:46,258
at the age of 15, I succeeded 
in passing the Sorcerer's Rite,

178
00:10:46,258 --> 00:10:48,552
showing prodigy-like control of my magic.

179
00:10:48,552 --> 00:10:50,978
The judges and the Draconian high council 
were amazed

180
00:10:50,978 --> 00:10:54,326
at how powerful my spells were 
for how long I had been training.

181
00:10:54,326 --> 00:10:55,555
At 20 years old,

182
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:59,363
I was the youngest appointed member 
of the magic guild in Draconian history.

183
00:10:59,363 --> 00:11:00,869
For the next few years,

184
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,700
I almost went mad from the malaise 
of being a guild member,

185
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,724
as it's rather boring.

186
00:11:05,724 --> 00:11:08,467
However, one day 
I happened upon a chamber,

187
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,903
unused for quite some time.

188
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,639
In the room were stacks of books

189
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,222
and maps of the surrounding cities 
and areas around the known world.

190
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:18,054
For months, 
I would frequent the chamber,

191
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:20,146
and learned of artifacts from legend.

192
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,015
After a long period of research,

193
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,312
I made a list of artifacts 
that caught my eye.

194
00:11:24,312 --> 00:11:26,596
I brought these findings 
to the high council

195
00:11:26,596 --> 00:11:28,448
and was told 
that all of the information

196
00:11:28,448 --> 00:11:30,226
in the chamber I had stumbled upon

197
00:11:30,226 --> 00:11:33,423
was either believed to be fiction, 
or unsolvable mysteries,

198
00:11:33,423 --> 00:11:35,345
and hence were lost forever.

199
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:38,603
I found those answers 
to be unacceptable.

200
00:11:38,603 --> 00:11:40,483
A year later, I devised a ruse

201
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:44,518
and managed to convince the city council 
to lend support in me leaving Draconia

202
00:11:44,518 --> 00:11:48,010
on a mission of peace and diplomacy 
for the surrounding kingdoms.

203
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,306
Going from town to town 
and making friends and allies,

204
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:52,452
in and for the name of Draconia.

205
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:53,888
Being a red dragonborn,

206
00:11:53,888 --> 00:11:57,167
I had quite the task on my hands 
in that respect,

207
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:58,903
but it was exactly what I needed

208
00:11:58,903 --> 00:12:02,267
so I could explore the world 
and find these artifacts,

209
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:04,324
as I felt the truth was out there.

210
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:08,571
Some may describe me as buffoonish, 
but I say poppycock to all that.

211
00:12:08,571 --> 00:12:11,373
I am much sharper 
than most give me credit for.

212
00:12:11,373 --> 00:12:14,416
I just don't pay attention 
to things sometimes.

213
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:19,139
I've also been known to be 
rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky,

214
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,078
and well, dangerous.

215
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:24,656
I can't help but show my true scales 
every now and then.

216
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:27,900
But overall, I think I'm quite friendly 
for a dragonborn!

217
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,367
LIAM: Never entirely welcome 
in the company of elves or men,

218
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:36,127
Vax'ildan learned at a young age 
to skip past formality,

219
00:12:36,127 --> 00:12:39,949
preferring instead 
to invite himself in your door.

220
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:44,199
Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, 
Vax was born by a chance encounter

221
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:47,494
between elven royalty 
and human peasantry.

222
00:12:47,494 --> 00:12:50,321
Raised by their mother 
in their early years,

223
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:52,228
the twins were eventually sent off 
to their father

224
00:12:52,228 --> 00:12:54,545
in the elven capital of Syngorn.

225
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:58,774
But their cool reception 
among the elves there never warmed,

226
00:12:58,774 --> 00:13:01,052
and their time in the capital didn't last.

227
00:13:01,052 --> 00:13:05,824
The siblings stole away one autumn night 
and set out on the open road.

228
00:13:05,824 --> 00:13:07,340
After a few years of wandering,

229
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,334
they eventually decided 
to return to their mother,

230
00:13:10,334 --> 00:13:12,707
and journeyed back 
to the lands of their youth.

231
00:13:12,707 --> 00:13:15,442
But instead of finding 
their childhood home,

232
00:13:15,442 --> 00:13:18,613
they returned to a pile of rubble.

233
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:21,776
Their mother was gone, 
their home burned to ash.

234
00:13:21,776 --> 00:13:24,639
Pressing the townspeople for answers,

235
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,309
they learned of the day 
the dragon came.

236
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:29,854
(roar)

237
00:13:29,854 --> 00:13:34,779
With their ties all severed, 
Vax'ildan and his sister set out

238
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:37,360
to find their fortune together 
in Tal'Dorei.

239
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,152
An outsider since birth, 
Vax quickly learned

240
00:13:41,152 --> 00:13:44,736
to solve life's challenges 
in his own particular way,

241
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:47,638
often by side-stepping them entirely.

242
00:13:47,638 --> 00:13:51,138
And when his knack 
for circumventing adversity isn't enough,

243
00:13:51,138 --> 00:13:52,685
(knife scraping)

244
00:13:52,685 --> 00:13:55,760
the way of blades 
the elves schooled him in

245
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,112
more than makes up the difference.

246
00:13:58,112 --> 00:14:02,714
LAURA: Like so many half-elves, 
Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life

247
00:14:02,714 --> 00:14:07,597
suffering the cool reception 
of a people who don't fully accept her.

248
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:11,142
Born of a human mother
and an elven father

249
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:14,058
who only later in life 
took an interest in their existence,

250
00:14:14,058 --> 00:14:18,744
Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan 
quickly realized

251
00:14:18,744 --> 00:14:22,080
the only people 
they could truly rely on in this world

252
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,003
were each other.

253
00:14:24,003 --> 00:14:27,946
It was at the age of ten
when the two were taken from their mother

254
00:14:27,946 --> 00:14:30,180
and brought to live in Syngorn,

255
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,786
the isolated elven city 
for which their father was an ambassador.

256
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:38,105
He quietly took them in, 
but always kept an icy distance,

257
00:14:38,105 --> 00:14:41,045
and after too many years 
of disdainful looks,

258
00:14:41,045 --> 00:14:44,598
the pair decided 
to leave his indifference behind,

259
00:14:44,598 --> 00:14:47,013
and set out on their own.

260
00:14:47,013 --> 00:14:49,002
Vax took to the cities,

261
00:14:49,002 --> 00:14:52,819
stealing small trinkets 
and learning the ways of the thief,

262
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:58,009
while Vex kept to the woods;
she preferred the isolation.

263
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:02,588
Always the keen observer, 
she learned to hunt and to track,

264
00:15:02,588 --> 00:15:04,931
to spy and to shoot.

265
00:15:04,931 --> 00:15:07,503
And through a series of fateful events,

266
00:15:07,503 --> 00:15:10,755
earned herself a companion 
in the form of a bear--

267
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:13,095
her own stolen Trinket--

268
00:15:13,095 --> 00:15:16,887
to fight alongside her 
and protect her fiercely.

269
00:15:16,887 --> 00:15:22,496
Also, he is adorable, 
and gives expert massages.

270
00:15:23,436 --> 00:16:24,574
[dramatic music]

271
00:16:30,742 --> 00:16:33,954
MATT: Hello, everyone!
Welcome back to Critical Role.

272
00:16:33,954 --> 00:16:38,795
First off, I want to thank the chat
for buying this amazing cloak.

273
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:44,457
This most delightful
Dungeon Master Cloak.

274
00:16:44,457 --> 00:16:46,058
TALIESIN: It makes your eyes pop.

275
00:16:46,058 --> 00:16:49,220
MATT: Does it? It makes more
than my eyes pop. (laughs)

276
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,645
So thank you, chat, that's amazing.
We did some videos with that.

277
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,752
It's a little warm in here for it
at the moment, but I'll be wearing it

278
00:16:54,752 --> 00:16:58,406
probably when we come back
from the break for a bit, too. Thank you.

279
00:16:58,406 --> 00:17:01,823
A couple other quick things.
First off, our shirts are up still.

280
00:17:01,823 --> 00:17:03,843
We have one more week on that,
but our goal

281
00:17:03,843 --> 00:17:06,291
by the end of this show tonight
is to get to 1,000 t-shirts sold.

282
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,164
If we get to 1,000
before the end of the game tonight,

283
00:17:08,164 --> 00:17:11,077
we are going to stay after
and do a Q&amp;A with you guys.

284
00:17:11,077 --> 00:17:13,718
So, go ahead and get some shirts.

285
00:17:13,718 --> 00:17:16,147
Wonderfully modeled
by a few of our team members here.

286
00:17:16,147 --> 00:17:20,535
You can find a link in the chat room,

287
00:17:20,535 --> 00:17:25,149
or you can go to
teespring.com/critical-role

288
00:17:25,149 --> 00:17:29,942
and they've got hoodies,
girl tees, guy tees. Rock it out.

289
00:17:29,942 --> 00:17:33,209
LIAM: 999 gets nothing!

290
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:38,542
MATT: Well, we'll see.
So yes, that's awesome.

291
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:41,685
Also, we have the subscriber giveaway.

292
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,489
As soon as we hit 2,850 tonight,
we are going to be giving away

293
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:47,108
one of the Tabletop Day promo kits
that are only available exclusively now

294
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,672
by subscribing to this channel.

295
00:17:48,672 --> 00:17:52,064
So, once we hit 2,850,
we are going to give away one of these

296
00:17:52,064 --> 00:17:54,850
to one of the random folks
in the chat room, so look forward to that.

297
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,962
Also, we have our charity,
which we do throughout the show.

298
00:17:58,962 --> 00:18:00,442
Marisha do you want
to take it away on that?

299
00:18:00,442 --> 00:18:03,465
MARISHA: Yes. 826LA, 
which is a non-profit,

300
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:08,590
after-school tutoring program
for kids K-12th grade.

301
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,575
They excel in creative writing
and reading.

302
00:18:12,575 --> 00:18:16,680
They're awesome. Donate to them.
Go check them out.

303
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,072
And there might be an 826 in your area,
so google 826.

304
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:24,494
They're always looking for tutors.
It's a good program.

305
00:18:24,494 --> 00:18:26,897
MATT: Go check it out.
A couple of other quick things.

306
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,945
If you guys haven't checked it out,
recently I had the opportunity

307
00:18:30,945 --> 00:18:34,298
to Dungeon Master for PewDiePie

308
00:18:34,298 --> 00:18:37,708
and cinnamontoastken,
his co-partner on the podcast there.

309
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,803
Episode went up a couple of days ago.
Had a lot of fun.

310
00:18:39,803 --> 00:18:40,982
Hopefully, we'll be doing that
again in the future,

311
00:18:40,982 --> 00:18:44,180
but I know probably a bunch of you folks
came through that this week, so welcome!

312
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,926
Welcome to our chaotic little show,
Critical Role.

313
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,822
Everyone in the chat room:
be nice, be welcoming.

314
00:18:48,822 --> 00:18:50,311
They've been really awesome.

315
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:53,242
Any other announcements we want to make
before we jump into the game?

316
00:18:53,242 --> 00:18:55,637
ORION: Yeah. Have we talked
about something important here, guys?

317
00:18:55,637 --> 00:18:57,835
There are these shirts
that we need to sell.

318
00:18:57,835 --> 00:18:59,574
LAURA: We just talked about them.

319
00:18:59,574 --> 00:19:02,552
SAM: For five minutes.
We literally just talked about that.

320
00:19:02,552 --> 00:19:07,310
ORION: Listen, guys, this is something
that we need to really discuss, first.

321
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,407
TRAVIS: That was amazing.
He comes in character!

322
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:17,439
(all laugh)

323
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:19,138
ORION: I love you, Travis

324
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:20,483
TRAVIS: I love you. I love you!

325
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:24,951
ORION: I think you guys out there
need to really look in your hearts--

326
00:19:24,951 --> 00:19:28,751
and moreover, your wallets--
and get one of our shirts.

327
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:31,459
Just get them, because they're dope.

328
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:34,649
MATT: Glowing recommendation
from Tiberius Stormwind.

329
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:36,612
TALIESIN: I like
that you two match, actually.

330
00:19:36,612 --> 00:19:42,193
LAURA: The episode of Dread part 2
came out today-- of TableTop.

331
00:19:42,193 --> 00:19:44,577
It's so intense! You can watch it
on Geek &amp; Sundry.

332
00:19:44,577 --> 00:19:49,873
I'm not telling you anything,
but it's very intense!

333
00:19:49,873 --> 00:19:51,374
TALIESIN: We can't talk about anything.

334
00:19:51,374 --> 00:19:53,845
SAM: Did we talk about the shirts?

335
00:19:53,845 --> 00:19:55,146
ORION: I don't think we did.

336
00:19:55,146 --> 00:19:58,935
MATT: Let's get this on the road, then,
so we can get into the story.

337
00:19:58,935 --> 00:20:01,629
LAURA: I'm so nervous!
TRAVIS: (laughing) I don't want to live.

338
00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:03,973
MATT: So. To get everyone caught up
to where we are...

339
00:20:03,973 --> 00:20:06,096
The party was initially sent on a quest

340
00:20:06,096 --> 00:20:09,748
into the mountainous region
beneath the dwarven city of Kraghammer

341
00:20:09,748 --> 00:20:15,675
to find a folk hero of the region
named Lady Kima of Vord,

342
00:20:15,675 --> 00:20:17,472
who's a halfling paladin
who had gone missing

343
00:20:17,472 --> 00:20:19,739
while on a vision quest
that had apparently led her to some evil

344
00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:22,144
that was brewing beneath the city.

345
00:20:22,144 --> 00:20:25,625
As the party went in search of her,
they ended up finding themselves

346
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,292
climbing deeper and deeper
into the Underdark,

347
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:30,321
a very scary portion
of the subterranean world,

348
00:20:30,321 --> 00:20:35,032
encountering numerous beasts
and talking cellphones.

349
00:20:35,032 --> 00:20:36,278
ORION: Sorry.

350
00:20:39,357 --> 00:20:41,057
(all laugh)

351
00:20:41,057 --> 00:20:43,112
SAM: Disadvantage.

352
00:20:43,112 --> 00:20:46,032
MATT: Discovering that there was 
apparently an alliance

353
00:20:46,032 --> 00:20:47,586
that had been forged 
between the illithids,

354
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:49,327
the mind flayers that lived down there,

355
00:20:49,327 --> 00:20:52,764
and the duergar, who normally are at odds.
They've forged some sort of pact.

356
00:20:52,764 --> 00:20:55,735
Upon battling their way deeper

357
00:20:55,735 --> 00:20:59,694
into the cavernous regions
below the lava-encrusted obsidian walls,

358
00:20:59,694 --> 00:21:02,929
they began to uncover a plot
that apparently some monstrosity,

359
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:07,033
some new dark leader
by the name of K'Varn

360
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:09,564
had been the one responsible
for uniting them

361
00:21:09,564 --> 00:21:11,305
and currently resides
in a temple in the center

362
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:16,096
of the subterranean illithid city
of Yug'Voril.

363
00:21:16,096 --> 00:21:20,004
You guys made your way down
to what seems to be the cavern

364
00:21:20,004 --> 00:21:23,709
that contains the island
that Yug'Voril resides upon.

365
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:26,784
You manage to scavenge a few broken boats
from the lake that surrounds the island.

366
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:30,060
Percy repaired them,
and you rode around the outskirts

367
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,044
to what seemed to be
some sort of a beach-side cavern.

368
00:21:33,044 --> 00:21:34,241
Upon entering the cavern,

369
00:21:34,241 --> 00:21:40,002
you found a partially-buried chest
or container of some kind

370
00:21:40,002 --> 00:21:44,590
in what looks like a camp
that had been destroyed and scattered,

371
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:48,132
and a few rotting corpses
against the walls.

372
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:49,990
As you continued to inspect the area,

373
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,500
the corpses began to rise
from their sitting positions.

374
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,232
With previous experience
in the realm of undead,

375
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:59,393
you, however, know
that these eyes of these creatures

376
00:21:59,393 --> 00:22:03,820
carry far more intelligence
than your run-of-the-mill zombie.

377
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,839
And that was where we left off
at this point in time,

378
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:09,812
which requires a music change.

379
00:22:11,403 --> 00:22:13,310
ASHLEY: Oh, just jumping right in?
LAURA: Just right into it.

380
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,639
MATT: Right in.

381
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:18,000
We have a good number of the party
that is still out in the boat

382
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,212
that is being towed by Keyleth,
currently in shark form.

383
00:22:20,212 --> 00:22:21,394
ASHLEY: We're in a boat?
TALIESIN: We're in a boat.

384
00:22:21,394 --> 00:22:23,883
ASHLEY: I'm in a boat.
I'm in a motherfucking boat.

385
00:22:23,883 --> 00:22:27,060
MATT: There's Keyleth's shark form.

386
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,612
LAURA: Where? Awesome.

387
00:22:29,612 --> 00:22:31,294
MATT: Right there.

388
00:22:31,294 --> 00:22:36,817
So in the cavern,
I believe we had Vax, we had Scanlan.

389
00:22:36,817 --> 00:22:41,238
Tiberius and Vex on the flying carpet
and are making their way down.

390
00:22:41,238 --> 00:22:42,514
You scouted ahead

391
00:22:42,514 --> 00:22:44,413
and began to check the interior 
before this happened.

392
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:46,868
So, these creatures
are now rising up off the ground,

393
00:22:46,868 --> 00:22:49,878
looking insidious in their expression,
all glaring at you,

394
00:22:49,878 --> 00:22:52,405
as you're the most
apparently-nearby individual.

395
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:54,456
What are you doing?

396
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,696
LAURA: You have fuzz in your hair.
MATT: And it's going to stay!

397
00:22:56,696 --> 00:22:59,371
LAURA: No you got it. It's gone.
MATT: Aw, damn it.

398
00:22:59,371 --> 00:23:02,259
MATT: I was hoping it would bother you
for the rest of the game.

399
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:04,247
So, that being the case,

400
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:08,309
we're jumping right into battle
at the top of this game

401
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:11,539
in the center of this beach-side cavern.
Roll initiative, everybody.

402
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:12,937
TRAVIS: Shit.
LAURA: God.

403
00:23:12,937 --> 00:23:17,262
SAM: First roll of the night. Yeah!
TRAVIS: Fuck yes.

404
00:23:19,382 --> 00:23:20,923
TALIESIN: Bam.

405
00:23:20,923 --> 00:23:26,799
MARISHA: New dice. Not bad.
SAM: (wordless squeal)

406
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,817
MATT: All right, so top of the round.
Who's got 25 to 20? Anybody?

407
00:23:29,817 --> 00:23:33,384
TALIESIN: 25.
MATT: Ooh! Percy with the rolls.

408
00:23:33,384 --> 00:23:36,967
MATT: Okay, so 25--
TRAVIS AND LAURA: 20.

409
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:40,446
MATT: 20 and 20 for Grog and Vex.

410
00:23:40,446 --> 00:23:44,506
All right. 20 to 15?

411
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:49,143
ORION: 16.
MATT: 16 for Tiberius.

412
00:23:49,143 --> 00:23:52,206
MATT: 15 to ten?

413
00:23:52,206 --> 00:23:55,610
LIAM: A really strong 13.
MATT: A really strong 13 for Vax.

414
00:23:55,610 --> 00:24:01,077
MARISHA: 12. For the shark.
MATT: All right.

415
00:24:01,077 --> 00:24:02,909
SAM: Me and Pike.
Worst rollers in the game.

416
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:05,019
MATT: (laughs) Don't say that.
You got this. You'll be fine.

417
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:07,561
SAM: Well, we roll well when it counts.

418
00:24:07,561 --> 00:24:10,444
ASHLEY: Yeah, but for initiative,
we always roll less.

419
00:24:10,444 --> 00:24:13,111
MATT: Well, that's the plate armor and--
I don't know why.

420
00:24:13,111 --> 00:24:16,147
And what have you guys got,
initiative-wise?

421
00:24:16,147 --> 00:24:19,129
SAM: Four.
ASHLEY: Oh, wow. I got seven.

422
00:24:19,129 --> 00:24:23,555
MATT: Pike, then Scanlan.
All right, so top of the round.

423
00:24:23,555 --> 00:24:27,129
Percy, you're out in the ship.
Are you going to stay on the ship?

424
00:24:27,129 --> 00:24:29,229
TALIESIN: (garbled) No.
MATT: (laughs)

425
00:24:29,229 --> 00:24:31,920
TALIESIN: (garbled) These cookies
are really good!

426
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,488
MATT: I know. Timing is everything.
What are you doing? Quick!

427
00:24:33,488 --> 00:24:37,064
TALIESIN: I'm going to tug on the rope
three times in succession

428
00:24:37,064 --> 00:24:41,585
to let our shark friend know
that it's time to boogie.

429
00:24:41,585 --> 00:24:44,313
I'm going to take the rope.
I'm going to jump out of the boat.

430
00:24:44,313 --> 00:24:45,977
Is there anything to tie the rope to?

431
00:24:45,977 --> 00:24:51,294
MATT: This beach is just gravel.
There's no particular physical element.

432
00:24:51,294 --> 00:24:53,699
Maybe on the far end,
there might be a part of the wall,

433
00:24:53,699 --> 00:24:56,774
but it's going to be an awkward hinge,
and there's really nowhere to latch--

434
00:24:56,774 --> 00:25:00,093
TALIESIN: Is there something
that if I had an adhesive that I could--

435
00:25:00,093 --> 00:25:03,461
MATT: Well, if you have an adhesive,
you might be able to stick it

436
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:06,682
to the wall at the far end of the beach--
the cavern wall that you're up against--

437
00:25:06,682 --> 00:25:09,731
but there's nothing
actually on the beach floor at all.

438
00:25:09,731 --> 00:25:15,645
TALIESIN: I'm going to attempt
to take the piece of rope,

439
00:25:15,645 --> 00:25:18,205
place it against the wall,

440
00:25:18,205 --> 00:25:22,110
and take an ice shot
slightly above the rope

441
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:25,069
and freeze it to the wall.

442
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:26,758
MATT: Okay. So as you hold it up,

443
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:30,591
you line up your enchanted ice chamber
of your Pepperbox,

444
00:25:30,591 --> 00:25:35,152
fire, and with an extremely loud echoing
(gun noise) gun shot sound

445
00:25:35,152 --> 00:25:37,473
throughout the cavern,
you see a blast.

446
00:25:37,473 --> 00:25:39,551
The bullet itself ricochets
and spins off into the distance,

447
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:41,875
into the darkness,
but you do see left behind,

448
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:43,926
where part of the rock
has chiseled from the impact,

449
00:25:43,926 --> 00:25:47,869
ice has coalesced and cracked 
and has, for the time being,

450
00:25:47,869 --> 00:25:49,710
held the rope 
to the edge of the cavern.

451
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,826
TALIESIN: I'm running in,
for the rest of my movement.

452
00:25:51,826 --> 00:25:55,680
MATT: All right, so Percy is there.

453
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,873
Percy, it's going to take you
a few rounds to get there.

454
00:25:57,873 --> 00:25:59,495
It's long, winding pathway,

455
00:25:59,495 --> 00:26:01,764
but you're in the process
of making your way there.

456
00:26:01,764 --> 00:26:06,056
All right, great, so that brings us
to Grog and Vex.

457
00:26:06,056 --> 00:26:07,234
Grog and Vex, what have you got?

458
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:10,451
TRAVIS: Would you like to go?
LAURA: Well, you're outside. You can go.

459
00:26:10,451 --> 00:26:12,812
TRAVIS: Is the boat beached 
on the shore yet?

460
00:26:12,812 --> 00:26:16,568
MATT: No, the boat is not beached.
The rope that the boat is attached to

461
00:26:16,568 --> 00:26:20,031
is currently attached to the wall,
so it's anchored.

462
00:26:20,031 --> 00:26:22,008
TRAVIS: Okay, good.
ASHLEY: And I'm in the boat?

463
00:26:22,008 --> 00:26:28,161
MATT: You're in the boat. 
Grog's in the boat. Clarota, Kima...

464
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:32,229
TRAVIS: I would like to bust out
at a full dead sprint after Percy.

465
00:26:32,229 --> 00:26:36,569
"There's no blood being had without me!"

466
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:39,272
MATT: As Grog leaps out,
(sploosh) splashing.

467
00:26:39,272 --> 00:26:41,288
It's shallow at this point.
You're about waist deep in the water.

468
00:26:41,288 --> 00:26:43,944
You trudge up to the shore,
run across the gravel beach,

469
00:26:43,944 --> 00:26:46,065
and start heading 
straight into the cavern after Percy.

470
00:26:46,065 --> 00:26:47,293
TRAVIS: Screaming.

471
00:26:47,293 --> 00:26:49,866
MATT: Yelling into the cavern,
a big old goliath scream.

472
00:26:49,866 --> 00:26:56,029
Laser pointer if anyone needs it,
by the way. There you go.

473
00:26:56,029 --> 00:26:57,797
All right, that brings us to Vex.

474
00:26:57,797 --> 00:26:59,578
LAURA: Which one looks biggest?

475
00:26:59,578 --> 00:27:02,846
MATT: You're still on top
of the flying carpet, the three of you.

476
00:27:02,846 --> 00:27:06,209
LAURA: Does one of the ghouls
look scarier than the others?

477
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:09,115
MATT: Best you can tell, there are three
that all look similar in stature.

478
00:27:09,115 --> 00:27:10,749
There's one over here
that is generally larger,

479
00:27:10,749 --> 00:27:14,470
taller, more lanky, and appears 
to have a semblance of armor on him still.

480
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:18,696
And he almost seems to be giving looks
and silent commands to the others.

481
00:27:18,696 --> 00:27:21,041
LAURA: He's a master zombie.
Hunter's Mark him.

482
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:23,987
MATT: What's the range on Hunter's Mark?
You're back here.

483
00:27:23,987 --> 00:27:31,462
TALIESIN: Hey, Laura!
LAURA: I did it!

484
00:27:31,462 --> 00:27:33,832
LAURA: Hunter's Mark, 90 feet.
MATT: Yeah, you can get there.

485
00:27:33,832 --> 00:27:37,608
LAURA: Okay, good. Well, I don't need it

486
00:27:37,608 --> 00:27:40,700
because I'm going to Conjure Barrage 
a cone at them all

487
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,410
once he's Hunter's Marked.

488
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,995
SAM: Barrage a cone?
Sounds like an Italian porn guy.

489
00:27:45,995 --> 00:27:48,583
MATT: Hunter's Mark on that one.

490
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,355
LAURA: While I whistle for Trinket
to get his butt in.

491
00:27:51,355 --> 00:27:55,161
MATT: Trinket's ears perk up
from the distance.

492
00:27:55,161 --> 00:27:56,334
He can hear your whistle
echoing through the cavern

493
00:27:56,334 --> 00:27:58,882
on the beach side.
He stumbles out of the boat,

494
00:27:58,882 --> 00:28:02,916
(sploosh) big splash,
and chases after Grog.

495
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:04,748
LAURA: Okay, and then I Conjure Barrage.

496
00:28:04,748 --> 00:28:07,036
MATT: All wet and soaked,
the fur pushed against the body.

497
00:28:07,036 --> 00:28:10,863
Conjure Barrage.
What's the range of that?

498
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:12,909
LAURA: It's a 60-foot cone.

499
00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:15,586
MATT: You are quite a distance
from most of them.

500
00:28:15,586 --> 00:28:17,501
You might have
to hop off the flying carpet.

501
00:28:17,501 --> 00:28:18,773
LAURA: I will?!

502
00:28:18,773 --> 00:28:22,594
ORION: She can move it just fine.
Just think, "forward."

503
00:28:22,594 --> 00:28:25,447
LAURA: Can we fly the carpet forward?

504
00:28:25,447 --> 00:28:28,301
MATT: You're currently
not in control of the carpet. Tiberius is.

505
00:28:28,301 --> 00:28:34,667
LAURA: Can I delay until--
what's your initiative?

506
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:37,651
ORION: Well, 16, but that's fine.

507
00:28:37,651 --> 00:28:40,227
LAURA: I'll delay until his. 
Can I do that?

508
00:28:40,227 --> 00:28:46,084
MATT: You can do that.
Vex delays on that. Grog's turn's ended.

509
00:28:46,084 --> 00:28:52,008
All right, so the undead take their turn.
So as all the entities rise up,

510
00:28:52,008 --> 00:28:57,077
they all swarm in,
rushing around with an unnatural speed.

511
00:28:57,077 --> 00:29:03,410
LIAM: Age ain't slowing them down nothing!
Wow. Hi, fellas!

512
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:08,648
MATT: They all leap up.
You see portions of their jaw dangling,

513
00:29:08,648 --> 00:29:11,910
with these sharp, awful blackened teeth
that are broken and gnarled.

514
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,044
LIAM: I feel so popular!

515
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:17,264
MATT: You glance around suddenly
as this darkened room,

516
00:29:17,264 --> 00:29:19,041
which you're able to make
a little bit of light

517
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:20,696
from Tiberius's light
on the end of his staff.

518
00:29:20,696 --> 00:29:24,998
They move (whoosh) with a blur of speed,
and they're right up in your face.

519
00:29:24,998 --> 00:29:27,338
TALIESIN: 28 Days Later zombies.

520
00:29:27,338 --> 00:29:31,055
LAURA: Oh, god.
Get out of the middle of them.

521
00:29:31,055 --> 00:29:34,688
MATT: First thing you notice: one of them 
is giving off an awful stench.

522
00:29:34,688 --> 00:29:38,893
The smell you smelled
when you first entered the cavern

523
00:29:38,893 --> 00:29:41,467
is now so strong
that it's nearly overpowering.

524
00:29:41,467 --> 00:29:42,961
LIAM: Is there one specifically?

525
00:29:42,961 --> 00:29:44,673
MATT: It's hard to find a source to it.

526
00:29:44,673 --> 00:29:47,686
However, you are taking a claw strike
from each of them.

527
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:48,373
LIAM: Oh, good.

528
00:29:48,373 --> 00:29:54,426
MATT: That is going to be a six.
That misses.

529
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:57,545
MATT: That is a 19?
LIAM: Yeah.

530
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,924
MATT: Hits. 18?
LIAM: Yeah.

531
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:02,913
MATT: And then 20.
LIAM: Hell yeah.

532
00:30:02,913 --> 00:30:05,359
MATT: All right. So, three claw strikes.

533
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:10,073
You take seven points of slashing damage,
another seven points of slashing damage,

534
00:30:10,073 --> 00:30:13,267
and then a ten, so that's 
a total of 24 points of slashing damage.

535
00:30:13,267 --> 00:30:14,443
LIAM: Okay. (grunts)

536
00:30:14,443 --> 00:30:20,600
MATT: As all these horribly-muddied
and half-rotted claws

537
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,771
start sinking past the armor
into your flesh, the back of your neck.

538
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:25,724
One catches you in the side.
And it all happens so fast,

539
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:29,159
you feel like you're almost spun around
by the sheer force of the impact.

540
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:32,197
I need you to make
three constitution saving throws.

541
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:38,227
SAM: They've got poison or something. 
They've got poison magic.

542
00:30:38,227 --> 00:30:41,708
LIAM: Okay. 15.
LAURA: Okay. Plus your constitution.

543
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:44,482
LIAM: Plus nothing.
LAURA: Oh really?!

544
00:30:44,482 --> 00:30:47,120
LIAM: It's all in speed, man. 15.
MATT: 15.

545
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,058
LIAM: Six.
MATT: All right.

546
00:30:49,058 --> 00:30:50,539
LIAM: 19.
MATT: Okay.

547
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:55,390
MATT: Okay. So, two of the impacts,
you feel this sense of strange rot

548
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,197
impeding upon your system,
and you shrug it off,

549
00:30:57,197 --> 00:31:00,086
but one of them still manages
to sift through, and your system seizes.

550
00:31:00,086 --> 00:31:01,972
You feel all the muscles in your body
begin to tighten up,

551
00:31:01,972 --> 00:31:03,424
and suddenly you are unable to move.

552
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:07,035
Your entire body
is one tense, giant, flexing muscle,

553
00:31:07,035 --> 00:31:09,124
and you're unable to shift anywhere
from your position.

554
00:31:09,124 --> 00:31:10,543
LIAM: (strained) Feels like rigor mortis.

555
00:31:10,543 --> 00:31:12,490
MATT: You're currently paralyzed, 
my friend.

556
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:16,975
LAURA: Oh no, I can't do anything.
You won't be able to dodge it.

557
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:19,471
MATT: Yeah, all right.
That brings us to Tiberius and Vex.

558
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:21,602
LIAM: Send a fireball right here.

559
00:31:21,602 --> 00:31:25,289
LAURA AND SAM: No!
TRAVIS: That would be bad.

560
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:27,046
ORION: How far away am I right now?

561
00:31:27,046 --> 00:31:29,229
MATT: Right here?
I'd say you're approximately--

562
00:31:29,229 --> 00:31:30,846
ORION: Well, I'll move the carpet

563
00:31:30,846 --> 00:31:34,030
the minimum distance I have to
for her to get in range.

564
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,417
MATT: You can probably push it 20 feet.
It's about there.

565
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:41,950
ORION: Okay, so that's where I'll stay.
"This doesn't look good."

566
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:47,569
I cast Obelisk of Stone
on my dear friend. (fshh)

567
00:31:47,569 --> 00:31:52,332
I'm going to raise him up
out of harm's way.

568
00:31:52,332 --> 00:31:55,728
MATT: All right. 
So, as you finish casting,

569
00:31:55,728 --> 00:31:59,480
you can see some of the actual sand
that fills the bottom of this cave

570
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,332
begins to swirl up in a wind
around Tiberius's hands,

571
00:32:02,332 --> 00:32:03,820
and as he lifts his arms up,

572
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:07,436
a single column of stone shakes
and shifts out of the ground,

573
00:32:07,436 --> 00:32:11,497
lifting your paralyzed body
15 feet into the air.

574
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:15,683
Thankfully, the actual cavern itself
is about 25 feet tall,

575
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,890
so it doesn't crush you
against the ceiling.

576
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:21,163
ORION: No, I only raise it about 20 feet.

577
00:32:21,163 --> 00:32:24,553
MATT: It can only go 15 feet for level 3.
Or 20. I'm sorry. 20 feet.

578
00:32:24,553 --> 00:32:26,560
So, you're barely
brought up to the ceiling.

579
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,159
It crests the top of your head,

580
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,608
but not enough to actually crush you
or do any damage.

581
00:32:30,608 --> 00:32:33,338
But you are seemingly out of harm's way
from the current undead onslaught.

582
00:32:33,338 --> 00:32:35,025
ORION: And then I go,
"That was a good idea!"

583
00:32:35,025 --> 00:32:37,709
And then I spend three sorcerer points

584
00:32:37,709 --> 00:32:42,358
and I hock a fireball (fwoosh)
at all those fuckers, too.

585
00:32:42,358 --> 00:32:45,156
MATT: All right, so Tiberius,
as you lift up the pillar with one hand,

586
00:32:45,156 --> 00:32:48,164
the dust settles and falls from your hand,
and as it does

587
00:32:48,164 --> 00:32:51,821
this hand back here begins to coalesce
this small bead of red burning energy.

588
00:32:51,821 --> 00:32:53,598
You fling it out with your off hand.

589
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:56,659
It streaks across,
hits the base of the pillar,

590
00:32:56,659 --> 00:33:00,001
and explodes
with a blast of red fiery magical energy.

591
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:04,122
Go ahead and roll damage.

592
00:33:04,122 --> 00:33:06,342
Your DC on that is 17, right?

593
00:33:06,342 --> 00:33:11,892
ORION: Yes. Two, four, six. 
Is it six or eight?

594
00:33:11,892 --> 00:33:15,326
MATT: They all failed their saving throw.
It's 8d6.

595
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:20,955
SAM: 8d6?! Jeez. Seems unfair.

596
00:33:23,145 --> 00:33:25,943
MATT: Same damage
your Lightning Bolt does.

597
00:33:26,913 --> 00:33:31,612
SAM: Oh, you're right.
Man, I'm a bad mama jama.

598
00:33:31,612 --> 00:33:35,762
ORION: 32 damage.
MATT: 32 damage.

599
00:33:35,762 --> 00:33:40,022
MATT: So. As you guys are running
into the cavern,

600
00:33:40,022 --> 00:33:42,844
you hear this loud,
familiar explosion sound

601
00:33:42,844 --> 00:33:45,695
that has this weird dull thud.
And then flaming heat.

602
00:33:45,695 --> 00:33:48,108
You see flickers of light
from around the bend,

603
00:33:48,108 --> 00:33:53,278
and this wave of heat hits you.
The explosion, as it finishes,

604
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:56,688
you can see these three undead
are completely incinerated

605
00:33:56,688 --> 00:33:58,909
and are left as burning cinders
on the ground.

606
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:00,400
This one's still standing.

607
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:05,443
However, the force of the explosion
also destroys the pillar from underneath.

608
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,983
SAM: Oh!
ORION: Oh, shit.

609
00:34:06,983 --> 00:34:07,953
(all laugh)

610
00:34:07,953 --> 00:34:10,026
MATT: Causing him to fall.

611
00:34:10,026 --> 00:34:14,733
ORION: Hold on, as he falls--
do I still have a movement after this?

612
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:20,366
MATT: You used your movement
to move the carpet, sorry.

613
00:34:20,366 --> 00:34:22,068
MARISHA: It's like the Tower of Terror.

614
00:34:22,068 --> 00:34:24,426
LIAM: How much bludgeoning damage
am I taking?

615
00:34:24,426 --> 00:34:26,587
MATT: You only take, I'd say, 2d6.
LIAM: Okay.

616
00:34:26,587 --> 00:34:28,170
MATT: No, 1d6,
because it's only a 20-foot fall.

617
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:30,197
LIAM: Right, okay.

618
00:34:30,197 --> 00:34:33,749
MATT: You're able to catch yourself,
and it's also sand, so it's not too hard.

619
00:34:33,749 --> 00:34:35,789
All right, that finishes your turn?

620
00:34:35,789 --> 00:34:40,568
ORION: It certainly does. 
"Vex, would you finish that bastard off?"

621
00:34:40,568 --> 00:34:45,161
MATT: Wait, you did land
in a bunch of rocks of the broken pillar.

622
00:34:45,161 --> 00:34:48,094
Roll another d6 points of damage.

623
00:34:48,094 --> 00:34:51,678
LIAM: That was more substantial.

624
00:34:51,678 --> 00:34:53,409
MATT: If it was the sand, 
it wasn't so hard,

625
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:56,523
but it was the fact that I realized
there was a whole crapton of pillar rubble

626
00:34:56,523 --> 00:34:59,543
that your paralyzed body fell upon,
unable to brace your fall.

627
00:34:59,543 --> 00:35:03,859
So. That's going to hurt in the morning.
Vex, you're up.

628
00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:08,423
LAURA: Okay. Well, there's "no" really
anybody else, so I'm going to...

629
00:35:08,423 --> 00:35:10,050
TRAVIS: (teasing) There's "no" really?

630
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:15,803
LAURA: There's "no" really anybody else--
I can shoot through my fire thing, right?

631
00:35:15,803 --> 00:35:18,684
MATT: If you want to, yeah.
You still haven't used it for the day.

632
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:22,010
LAURA: Should I save it?

633
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:24,787
LAURA: I'll attack him twice.
MATT: Okay, you're attacking him twice.

634
00:35:24,787 --> 00:35:27,794
MATT: As you're sitting on the carpet,
you pull out (schwoop, schwoop)

635
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:30,231
and rapidly release two arrows
in succession.

636
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:31,959
LAURA: Oh, natural 20!

637
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:33,117
(all cheer)

638
00:35:33,117 --> 00:35:35,152
MATT: Yeah! All right.
And what's the other attack?

639
00:35:35,152 --> 00:35:35,925
LAURA: 21.

640
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,462
MATT: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

641
00:35:37,462 --> 00:35:42,175
LAURA: Hit him. Oh, actually, 23.
I forgot I had bracers on.

642
00:35:42,175 --> 00:35:45,364
MATT: That hits. Well, the bracers only 
affect your damage, not to hit.

643
00:35:45,364 --> 00:35:48,394
LAURA: Good to know! 21!

644
00:35:48,394 --> 00:35:51,620
MATT: You get +2 to all damage rolls
with ranged attacks.

645
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,258
LAURA: What do I do for a critical, then?

646
00:35:53,258 --> 00:35:55,608
MATT: You roll the regular damage,
multiply it by two,

647
00:35:55,608 --> 00:35:57,167
and then add your modifier at the end.

648
00:35:57,167 --> 00:36:03,927
LAURA: Okay. Oh, that's not that good.
15 for the first one.

649
00:36:03,927 --> 00:36:08,199
And 12 for the second one.

650
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,952
MATT: And Hunter's Mark on both of those?

651
00:36:09,952 --> 00:36:14,198
LAURA: And Hunter's Mark on both!
MATT: Because it's on the board? (laughs)

652
00:36:14,198 --> 00:36:18,120
LAURA: That was definitely a six.
That was a six!

653
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,407
MATT: There you go!
LAURA: Seven, then, for Hunter's Mark.

654
00:36:21,407 --> 00:36:26,449
MATT: The smoke filters out of the way,
and you make the visual.

655
00:36:26,449 --> 00:36:28,622
You see your brother on the ground,
currently seizing,

656
00:36:28,622 --> 00:36:30,678
and in the rubble,
you see the shadow of one of the undead,

657
00:36:30,678 --> 00:36:33,661
still standing angrily. 
It rears back with its claws forward

658
00:36:33,661 --> 00:36:36,966
and gives this horrible gnashing sound
as its jaw opens and actually widens.

659
00:36:36,966 --> 00:36:39,943
This long tongue (wet sucking noise)
whips out on it.

660
00:36:39,943 --> 00:36:41,385
As you bear down and release one arrow,

661
00:36:41,385 --> 00:36:43,478
(shoomf) piercing the side
of its shoulder.

662
00:36:43,478 --> 00:36:45,543
As it reaches out to break it off,
its tongue still out,

663
00:36:45,543 --> 00:36:47,920
the second one goes into the tongue,
out the back of the throat.

664
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,129
(choking noise) It reaches up
and breaks off the arrow in the throat,

665
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:55,777
looks towards you, goes to lunge,
and as it does, you can see

666
00:36:55,777 --> 00:36:59,662
it just collapses on top of his body,
no longer moving.

667
00:36:59,662 --> 00:37:03,480
TRAVIS: Embrace him. Embrace him!
LIAM: Give me some sugar.

668
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:09,731
MATT: All right, so. The rest of you 
finally make your way into the cavern.

669
00:37:09,731 --> 00:37:14,456
You manage to shrug off
the rest of this paralyzation,

670
00:37:14,456 --> 00:37:16,595
stiffly get up,
and find your way out of the rubble.

671
00:37:16,595 --> 00:37:19,703
LAURA: Can we land? Tiberius?
ORION: I'm sorry. Yes.

672
00:37:19,703 --> 00:37:20,977
TRAVIS: Tell me it's not over.

673
00:37:20,977 --> 00:37:23,689
SAM: Oh. Sorry, Grog. The fight's over.
ORION: Sorry, Grog.

674
00:37:23,689 --> 00:37:26,245
TRAVIS: I live for one thing.

675
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:28,916
ASHLEY: Am I close enough
to get out of the boat?

676
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:30,257
MATT: Yeah, you can get out of the boat.

677
00:37:30,257 --> 00:37:31,982
LAURA: Are you alive?
LIAM: I'm alive.

678
00:37:31,982 --> 00:37:34,901
MATT: Keyleth, you're left out there
as a shark as everyone goes inside.

679
00:37:34,901 --> 00:37:36,924
LAURA: I go look at the treasure chest.
SAM: I'm going, too!

680
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:39,134
LIAM: Good job, badasses.

681
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:42,538
MARISHA: I'll stay with the boat.

682
00:37:42,538 --> 00:37:45,068
TALIESIN: All right, that was... fine.

683
00:37:45,068 --> 00:37:47,462
ASHLEY: I didn't even need
to get out of the boat.

684
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:49,390
You guys just handled it like that.

685
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:53,061
TALIESIN: I'll go back to the boat, then.
It's fine. I don't care.

686
00:37:53,061 --> 00:37:57,109
ORION: I'm sorry, Percy.
Listen, I'm sorry, everybody.

687
00:37:57,109 --> 00:38:00,629
I didn't mean to kill everybody 
so quickly.

688
00:38:00,629 --> 00:38:03,343
I'll let you kill everybody next time, 
Percy.

689
00:38:03,343 --> 00:38:06,055
MATT: Vex, you go over
and lift the top of the chest,

690
00:38:06,055 --> 00:38:08,807
which was unlocked previously
by your brother.

691
00:38:08,807 --> 00:38:11,235
As you lift it up, for a split second

692
00:38:11,235 --> 00:38:15,006
you see what looks like a flash
of orange energy-- a very familiar one,

693
00:38:15,006 --> 00:38:17,961
as suddenly, a secondary fire blast
(explosion sound)

694
00:38:17,961 --> 00:38:20,291
emanates from the treasure chest itself.

695
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:22,553
LAURA: I thought you checked for traps.
LIAM: I didn't do nothing!

696
00:38:22,553 --> 00:38:25,204
(others laugh)

697
00:38:25,204 --> 00:38:26,850
MATT: The blast radius
sends the top half of the chest

698
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:30,325
careening off
and scraping off the roof of the cavern.

699
00:38:30,325 --> 00:38:32,864
You guys, who just turned the corner,
see this giant explosion,

700
00:38:32,864 --> 00:38:34,337
sending you about 20 feet backwards.

701
00:38:34,337 --> 00:38:38,702
LAURA: Awesome. Good thing
you didn't get there in time, Scanlan.

702
00:38:38,702 --> 00:38:40,616
LIAM: Is that chest
ten feet away from me, as well?

703
00:38:40,616 --> 00:38:43,143
MATT: Yeah. So a reflex saving throw
for both of you.

704
00:38:43,143 --> 00:38:48,012
LAURA: Okay, cool.
LIAM: I have a thing I can do, too.

705
00:38:48,012 --> 00:38:50,315
LAURA: What's reflex? Is that dexterity?

706
00:38:50,315 --> 00:38:53,819
MATT: Or dexterity, sorry.
(sing-song) Carry over from Pathfinder.

707
00:38:53,819 --> 00:38:55,064
I meant dexterity.

708
00:38:55,064 --> 00:38:59,683
LAURA: 30.
MATT: 30? Jesus Christ.

709
00:38:59,683 --> 00:39:01,230
LIAM: This is a dexterity check?

710
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,825
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: 20.

711
00:39:03,825 --> 00:39:08,016
MATT: You both manage to find a way
to dodge most of the impact,

712
00:39:08,016 --> 00:39:10,391
but you still both
take 14 points of fire damage.

713
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:13,254
LIAM: As a rogue with evasion,
if I succeed, it's nothing.

714
00:39:13,254 --> 00:39:15,211
MATT: Then you take nothing.

715
00:39:15,211 --> 00:39:17,217
LAURA: As a twin of a rogue...

716
00:39:17,217 --> 00:39:19,186
MATT: You take 14 points of fire damage.

717
00:39:19,186 --> 00:39:22,358
LAURA: Can I have your thingy
LIAM: My thingy?

718
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:24,189
LAURA: Your eraser thingy?
LIAM: I don't know where it is.

719
00:39:24,189 --> 00:39:25,427
LAURA: Oh, thanks.
ASHLEY: You're welcome.

720
00:39:25,427 --> 00:39:28,169
MATT: The familiar whine of the trap
catches your ear.

721
00:39:28,169 --> 00:39:31,807
You dodge out of the way instinctively.
Your sister's not so lucky.

722
00:39:31,807 --> 00:39:34,011
You take the brunt of the damage,
but not the full damage.

723
00:39:34,011 --> 00:39:36,922
LAURA: Oh no. Did I destroy the loot?

724
00:39:36,922 --> 00:39:39,004
MATT: If you want to inspect
what the chest once was.

725
00:39:39,004 --> 00:39:44,975
As you go back to where the chest was,
most of the chest is destroyed.

726
00:39:44,975 --> 00:39:47,199
It's knocked off its hinge.

727
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:53,047
What you do find inside, though,
is what looks like a very, very...

728
00:39:56,842 --> 00:39:59,887
There we go.

729
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:05,127
What looks like a slightly-charred
two-handed blade:

730
00:40:05,127 --> 00:40:08,097
a giant sword
that is currently laid inside.

731
00:40:08,097 --> 00:40:10,670
Looks like it's been there
a while in storage.

732
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,216
There was a set of natural armor

733
00:40:12,216 --> 00:40:14,278
that's been completely destroyed
by the blast.

734
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:16,230
LAURA: Aw, come on!

735
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,977
MATT: There are a number
of coins in there.

736
00:40:18,977 --> 00:40:21,682
There's probably a good,
hefty pile of gold,

737
00:40:21,682 --> 00:40:25,599
slightly molded by the moisture

738
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,491
that's been kept inside this chest
until it was detonated.

739
00:40:28,491 --> 00:40:32,575
Gathering it up, you find 
approximately 420 gold pieces.

740
00:40:32,575 --> 00:40:35,327
SAM: Yeah, 420.

741
00:40:35,327 --> 00:40:38,835
LIAM: What's that mean?
Is that a reference? What is that?

742
00:40:38,835 --> 00:40:40,769
MATT: But for everything
that was damaged inside the chest,

743
00:40:40,769 --> 00:40:43,321
the sword,
which would be considered a greatsword,

744
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:45,629
seems to be largely unaffected
by the blast,

745
00:40:45,629 --> 00:40:47,706
other than a little bit of soot
that you had to rub off the blade.

746
00:40:47,706 --> 00:40:49,491
LAURA: I'll take it to Grog,

747
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:51,917
because I figure 
he'll probably be able to use it.

748
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:54,151
MATT: There you go.
She hands you this fantastic sword.

749
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:55,382
LAURA: I don't know
if it's magic or anything, Grog,

750
00:40:55,382 --> 00:40:57,680
so you might want to have Tiberius
have a look at it.

751
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,152
TRAVIS: "Hold on, let me check."
I take it and I shake it really hard.

752
00:41:00,152 --> 00:41:01,950
ORION: That's not how you really--

753
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:06,244
TRAVIS: I think I know what I'm doing.
All right, here. You can check it.

754
00:41:06,244 --> 00:41:09,699
ORION: As he's doing that,
I get 18 trying to see what's up.

755
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:12,979
MATT: Okay, there's definitely
a magical aura emanating from the blade.

756
00:41:12,979 --> 00:41:17,491
You take a moment to inspect it,
and you ascertain the magical nature.

757
00:41:17,491 --> 00:41:23,456
ORION: What you have there
is a Greatsword of Frenzy, Grog.

758
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:26,835
You have a +1 bonus
to attack and damage rolls

759
00:41:26,835 --> 00:41:28,368
made with this magic weapon.

760
00:41:28,368 --> 00:41:30,917
Ooh! When you attack a creature
with this magic weapon

761
00:41:30,917 --> 00:41:34,037
and roll a 20 on the attack roll,
after dealing damage,

762
00:41:34,037 --> 00:41:36,961
you can immediately
make an additional attack for free.

763
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:38,904
TRAVIS: Glad I shook it.

764
00:41:38,904 --> 00:41:42,736
LAURA: Pass that piece of paper over here.

765
00:41:42,736 --> 00:41:44,413
SAM: Maybe Scanlan could use it.

766
00:41:44,413 --> 00:41:46,150
MATT: Scanlan could.
It's a little big for you.

767
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,653
You'd be at quite a disadvantage
using this weapon.

768
00:41:48,653 --> 00:41:55,101
TRAVIS: Give it over here.
A Greatsword of Frenzy?

769
00:41:55,101 --> 00:41:57,137
SAM: I'd like to rage frenzy.

770
00:42:00,197 --> 00:42:04,566
Are there any bodies
that we can look at?

771
00:42:04,566 --> 00:42:08,309
MATT: You guys were inspecting

772
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:11,732
what remains 
of three of the undead creatures.

773
00:42:11,732 --> 00:42:15,723
They have been turned to ash, pretty much,
from the force of the explosion,

774
00:42:15,723 --> 00:42:18,942
the arcane nature of the detonation.
You find pieces of them.

775
00:42:18,942 --> 00:42:21,305
Most of them have been charred
and burned away from the bodies,

776
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:24,402
who are already
in partially-decomposed form.

777
00:42:24,402 --> 00:42:28,067
The larger one
that you had Hunter's Marked, though.

778
00:42:28,067 --> 00:42:30,633
Upon inspecting it,
while most of its armor is destroyed,

779
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:33,968
it does manage to carry
a partially-mildewed coin purse.

780
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:38,231
Looking inside, you only find 
about five or six pieces of gold,

781
00:42:38,231 --> 00:42:41,717
but you do find one really, 
really nice...

782
00:42:41,717 --> 00:42:44,367
looks like it's taken
a little bit of damage,

783
00:42:44,367 --> 00:42:46,259
but it was once
a really pretty diamond.

784
00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:50,825
LAURA: I'm just going to keep this
with the party gold.

785
00:42:50,825 --> 00:42:55,036
SAM: With the party treasury? Oh, sure.
LAURA: Plus one diamond to the treasury.

786
00:42:55,036 --> 00:42:57,785
ORION: "Vex, let me see the diamond
for just one second."

787
00:42:57,785 --> 00:43:00,554
As he's shaking his sword,

788
00:43:00,554 --> 00:43:03,937
I go into the Bag of Holding
and take out the Mending Wheel.

789
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:13,144
LAURA: Did you turn it back into coal?
ORION: That's not how it works, Vex.

790
00:43:13,144 --> 00:43:14,901
MATT: Tiberius, you reach
into the Bag of Holding.

791
00:43:14,901 --> 00:43:18,031
You pull out the Mending Wheel,
which is a magical artifact

792
00:43:18,031 --> 00:43:21,736
that you found earlier in the campaign
as part of your personal quest.

793
00:43:21,736 --> 00:43:25,819
It looks like a large, spoked,
roulette wheel when it's laying down,

794
00:43:25,819 --> 00:43:28,573
with these strange points
that fold out of it.

795
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:29,905
Once you spin the wheel,

796
00:43:29,905 --> 00:43:32,904
you place an object
in the center of the wheel.

797
00:43:32,904 --> 00:43:35,122
It's lifted without gravity

798
00:43:35,122 --> 00:43:37,436
and mends itself 
back to its undamaged form.

799
00:43:37,436 --> 00:43:40,346
You place the diamond in the center
and spin the wheel.

800
00:43:40,346 --> 00:43:43,915
You can see the actual cracks
on the surface of it slowly begin to mend.

801
00:43:43,915 --> 00:43:47,001
Eventually, the diamond is brought
to a solid, undamaged,

802
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:50,011
finely-cut example of a diamond.

803
00:43:50,011 --> 00:43:53,071
LAURA: Whoa, sparkles!
ORION: There you go.

804
00:43:53,071 --> 00:43:55,915
ASHLEY: It's so pretty!

805
00:43:55,915 --> 00:44:01,181
SAM: What time of day?
MATT: You have no idea.

806
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:03,870
SAM: How long has it been
since we rested?

807
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:06,475
MATT: It hasn't been too terribly long.

808
00:44:06,475 --> 00:44:08,583
You rested at the camp
after taking out Queen Ulara,

809
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:11,454
so I'd say it's probably been about--
with the travel to get to this point,

810
00:44:11,454 --> 00:44:12,988
probably about six hours 
since you rested.

811
00:44:12,988 --> 00:44:15,998
TRAVIS: Plus, nobody is hurt.
LAURA: Well, he's hurt.

812
00:44:15,998 --> 00:44:17,675
TRAVIS: Well, I'm not hurt.

813
00:44:17,675 --> 00:44:21,235
LAURA: Can I perception check
around the cave?

814
00:44:21,235 --> 00:44:23,549
MATT: Go ahead and roll perception.

815
00:44:23,549 --> 00:44:26,131
SAM: Can I remind our party
of a couple things?

816
00:44:26,131 --> 00:44:31,911
Pike, might be a good time
to try to heal Vax's foot again.

817
00:44:31,911 --> 00:44:35,188
And also, while we have a moment,

818
00:44:35,188 --> 00:44:38,543
did we ever discern
what is in that yellow vial?

819
00:44:38,543 --> 00:44:42,701
ORION: Oh this thing?
SAM: Yeah, do we know what this is?

820
00:44:42,701 --> 00:44:51,669
ORION: I'll do an arcana check
on the vial, which is not great.

821
00:44:51,669 --> 00:44:54,321
"I don't know, it looks icky."

822
00:44:54,321 --> 00:44:59,366
SAM: Let me take a look, as well.
Ooh, yes. 24.

823
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:04,206
MATT: You take a look at the liquid
and it looks enchanted,

824
00:45:04,206 --> 00:45:05,723
but the way its mixture is,

825
00:45:05,723 --> 00:45:09,169
the colors seem to swirl and shift
in a very caustic way.

826
00:45:09,169 --> 00:45:12,082
You can see from glancing
at the glass vial it's contained in,

827
00:45:12,082 --> 00:45:15,374
the interior of the glass
looks slightly pock-marked,

828
00:45:15,374 --> 00:45:19,282
almost like the viscous fluid within
has actually damaged the glass slightly.

829
00:45:19,282 --> 00:45:21,917
SAM: It sounds bad. Bad news.

830
00:45:21,917 --> 00:45:23,876
MATT: You're unable to really ascertain
what the nature of the liquid is,

831
00:45:23,876 --> 00:45:25,877
but those are the details
you can make out, currently.

832
00:45:25,877 --> 00:45:28,182
ASHLEY: I went over to Vax's foot again.

833
00:45:28,182 --> 00:45:31,766
LAURA: Oh no, come on! Don't!

834
00:45:31,766 --> 00:45:33,362
(all laugh)

835
00:45:33,362 --> 00:45:35,900
SAM: There's a little zombie poo on it.

836
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,170
LAURA: I'm getting real tired 
of your shit.

837
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:42,530
LIAM: Ever since we were five.

838
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:45,124
LAURA: I rolled 22 on perception, 
by the way.

839
00:45:45,124 --> 00:45:47,167
MATT: All right. Make a medicine check.

840
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:50,892
ORION: Does this cave bottleneck?

841
00:45:50,892 --> 00:45:53,090
MATT: It ends here.
This is the end of the cave.

842
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:55,726
It curved around
and ended in this little portion here.

843
00:45:55,726 --> 00:46:01,552
So you had a perception check?
What did you roll?

844
00:46:01,552 --> 00:46:04,180
LAURA: 22.
MATT: 22.

845
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:08,139
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes!
SAM: Oh, snap.

846
00:46:08,139 --> 00:46:10,910
MARISHA: Secrets.
TRAVIS: The second whisper.

847
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:14,644
SAM: Get down into frame!
Lower into frame. Pull them down.

848
00:46:14,644 --> 00:46:16,762
ORION: Pull them down.

849
00:46:16,762 --> 00:46:20,143
SAM: Ladies and gentlemen,

850
00:46:20,143 --> 00:46:25,055
we have a bunch of shirts
to sell tonight.

851
00:46:25,055 --> 00:46:29,783
LAURA: (quietly) I think maybe...
LIAM: You look weird. What's up?

852
00:46:29,783 --> 00:46:35,064
LAURA: We should not be hanging out
in this room right now.

853
00:46:35,064 --> 00:46:38,644
Can I try to get a better look
at what I saw?

854
00:46:38,644 --> 00:46:42,820
MATT: You see, best you can,
and you guys follow her eyeline.

855
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,018
You look up, and you see

856
00:46:45,018 --> 00:46:48,724
what first looks like
it's part of the cavern ceiling.

857
00:46:48,724 --> 00:46:51,589
It has this weird texture.
It looks almost like the smooth rock

858
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:55,136
that the interior of the cavern
comes off as.

859
00:46:55,136 --> 00:46:56,912
However, as you see it shift and move,

860
00:46:56,912 --> 00:47:00,892
it looks almost like a portion of it
is moving and slowly crawling,

861
00:47:00,892 --> 00:47:06,358
and it looks like there's
a red gleaming eye, and then two,

862
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:08,939
and something drops down from the side,

863
00:47:08,939 --> 00:47:10,529
almost like a tail
that seems to dangle for a second.

864
00:47:10,529 --> 00:47:12,315
At which point, it detaches.

865
00:47:12,315 --> 00:47:15,658
(fwoosh) Opens up
almost like a giant ray,

866
00:47:15,658 --> 00:47:19,124
with a screeching mouth that
(screeches) screams at you.

867
00:47:19,124 --> 00:47:21,262
It lands down in the center of the room.

868
00:47:21,262 --> 00:47:24,527
ASHLEY: I rolled a nine for medicine,
just B-T-W.

869
00:47:24,527 --> 00:47:28,664
(all laugh)

870
00:47:28,664 --> 00:47:30,850
LIAM: How's my foot doing these days?

871
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:33,214
MATT: Your foot is still healing,
but unfortunately,

872
00:47:33,214 --> 00:47:36,279
based on the medicine roll,
it is getting better

873
00:47:36,279 --> 00:47:40,050
but not enough to complete the process
of you getting all your toes back.

874
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:41,918
ASHLEY: I saw that thing
out of the corner of my eye

875
00:47:41,918 --> 00:47:45,080
and was just distracted.

876
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:50,885
ORION: You guys want to run?
SAM: Oh, what is that thing?

877
00:47:50,885 --> 00:47:56,070
LAURA: It's a big ray of death.
I don't know.

878
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:58,447
LIAM: It does
look like a flying manta ray.

879
00:47:58,447 --> 00:47:59,954
MATT: Let's roll some initiative, folks.

880
00:47:59,954 --> 00:48:01,199
LAURA: Ugh!
ASHLEY: Ugh, come on!

881
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:04,285
SAM: Get out of this cave.
LIAM: Cheeky bastard.

882
00:48:04,285 --> 00:48:08,336
ASHLEY: Oh, really? Really?
I just rolled a natural 20.

883
00:48:08,336 --> 00:48:10,238
Why couldn't I get that for medicine?

884
00:48:10,238 --> 00:48:13,125
MATT: That's how it works.

885
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:18,704
MARISHA: Just throwing it out there:
still the shark with the boat.

886
00:48:18,704 --> 00:48:22,216
LAURA: Ugh, double 20s on the table.

887
00:48:22,216 --> 00:48:23,240
LIAM: Natural 20.

888
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,762
MARISHA: If you guys want to run,
the keys are in the car.

889
00:48:25,762 --> 00:48:30,628
The engine's warmed up, ready to go.
I've got the key turned on.

890
00:48:30,628 --> 00:48:32,528
It's nice and cozy.

891
00:48:32,528 --> 00:48:38,985
That's such a good roll, though.
That's a good initiative roll.

892
00:48:42,105 --> 00:48:46,187
MATT: So at this, 
this thing leaps out from almost nowhere.

893
00:48:46,187 --> 00:48:49,161
The only reason you picked it up
is your acute vision, and as it lands,

894
00:48:49,161 --> 00:48:50,769
it's right around the corner
from the two of you,

895
00:48:50,769 --> 00:48:54,783
and it has this long,
almost spined tail

896
00:48:54,783 --> 00:49:01,025
and this jaw that opens up,
this nasty, toothy gaping maw.

897
00:49:01,025 --> 00:49:05,853
All right.
Initiative rolls of 25 to 20?

898
00:49:05,853 --> 00:49:07,452
TALIESIN: 22.
MATT: 22.

899
00:49:07,452 --> 00:49:09,440
TRAVIS: 21.
LIAM: 25.

900
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,274
MATT: 25. All right.
TRAVIS: And the shark.

901
00:49:12,274 --> 00:49:14,542
MARISHA: 20.

902
00:49:14,542 --> 00:49:18,714
ASHLEY: 20.
MATT: Nice. All right.

903
00:49:18,714 --> 00:49:21,714
MATT: What were you?

904
00:49:21,714 --> 00:49:25,374
TALIESIN: 22.
TRAVIS: Plus Ash's was natural 20.

905
00:49:25,374 --> 00:49:27,641
MATT: And Grog, what was yours again?

906
00:49:27,641 --> 00:49:32,368
TRAVIS: 21.
MATT: All right.

907
00:49:32,368 --> 00:49:34,848
MATT: 20 to 15?

908
00:49:34,848 --> 00:49:38,653
ORION: 18.
MATT: 18 for Tiberius. 15 to ten?

909
00:49:38,653 --> 00:49:40,981
SAM: 11.
MATT: 11 for Scanlan.

910
00:49:40,981 --> 00:49:42,400
LAURA: Ten.
MATT: Ten.

911
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,501
ASHLEY: Sorry, Scanlan.

912
00:49:43,501 --> 00:49:45,417
SAM: It's all right.
I'll see you next match.

913
00:49:45,417 --> 00:49:48,435
MARISHA: We're all over ten, though.

914
00:49:48,435 --> 00:49:52,607
That's pretty good, guys.
We should be proud of that.

915
00:49:52,607 --> 00:49:54,971
MATT: All right, so top of the round.
As this creature sits there,

916
00:49:54,971 --> 00:49:56,970
it's giving off this weird,
horrible moaning sound

917
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:02,848
(screeches)

918
00:50:02,848 --> 00:50:05,220
that's starting 
to just fill your ears.

919
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,769
At the top of the round is Vax.

920
00:50:07,769 --> 00:50:11,506
LAURA: What should we do? Command us.

921
00:50:11,506 --> 00:50:12,844
LIAM: Command us?

922
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:14,234
LAURA: Do you want us to stay?

923
00:50:14,234 --> 00:50:15,413
LIAM: Run!

924
00:50:15,413 --> 00:50:17,999
(all laugh)

925
00:50:17,999 --> 00:50:20,903
LIAM: We've never done it before!

926
00:50:20,903 --> 00:50:23,645
LAURA: We've never run!
TRAVIS: Let's see what happens!

927
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:26,999
LIAM: What the hell is it called?
My quick action to dash.

928
00:50:26,999 --> 00:50:29,215
LAURA: Just leaving me?
LIAM: Yeah!

929
00:50:29,215 --> 00:50:30,634
LAURA: You're leaving me behind?

930
00:50:30,634 --> 00:50:32,540
LIAM: Can I grab her by the scruff 
and run?

931
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:35,257
MATT: If you want to try and move her,
you'll basically move both of you.

932
00:50:35,257 --> 00:50:38,870
You can do that,
but you'll have no other action.

933
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,538
LIAM: That's what I want to do.
MATT: Okay.

934
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,039
LIAM: Grabbing my sister.

935
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,200
MATT: Grab your sister.

936
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,469
ORION: Get on the damn carpet, you fools!

937
00:50:45,469 --> 00:50:47,128
LAURA: (groaning) Can it fit us?

938
00:50:47,128 --> 00:50:49,524
MATT: Currently, you guys would be able
to get onto the carpet.

939
00:50:49,524 --> 00:50:51,541
LAURA: We jump onto the carpet!

940
00:50:51,541 --> 00:50:53,370
ASHLEY: What if he flies?
LAURA: He probably does.

941
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:56,456
MATT: What?! 
Why would a giant winged-thing fly?

942
00:50:56,456 --> 00:51:00,034
ASHLEY: laughs)
He looks like he flies, guys.

943
00:51:00,034 --> 00:51:05,453
SAM: Wait! Can we have an aerial battle 
over water? Let's do it!

944
00:51:05,453 --> 00:51:08,600
MATT: Percy.
TALIESIN: I'm on the boat.

945
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,522
MATT: No, you're not on the boat.

946
00:51:10,522 --> 00:51:12,298
You guys have come into the cavern
after this point, when you gave chase.

947
00:51:12,298 --> 00:51:13,434
You guys are in the cavern.

948
00:51:13,434 --> 00:51:14,980
TALIESIN: I started heading
back to the boat.

949
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:18,570
MATT: Oh, you did?
Then yeah, you're still out by the boat.

950
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:20,756
TALIESIN: So I just heard
someone yell, "run."

951
00:51:20,756 --> 00:51:26,719
So I'm going to start unhooking the boat.
I'm getting the boat ready to go.

952
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:27,739
MATT: You take the butt of your gun

953
00:51:27,739 --> 00:51:30,725
and you start bashing against the ice
that you set against the wall. It cracks,

954
00:51:30,725 --> 00:51:32,558
and eventually you get the rope free
from the side of the wall.

955
00:51:32,558 --> 00:51:36,472
TALIESIN: And I'm bringing the boat around
so that people can get on really quick.

956
00:51:36,472 --> 00:51:38,952
MATT: Okay. That brings us to Grog.

957
00:51:38,952 --> 00:51:43,081
TRAVIS: I would like to rage... and run!

958
00:51:43,081 --> 00:51:43,933
(all laugh)

959
00:51:43,933 --> 00:51:47,123
TRAVIS: Passing as many people as I can!

960
00:51:47,123 --> 00:51:48,972
MATT: All right!

961
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:52,178
TRAVIS: Rage running! (frantic noises)

962
00:51:52,178 --> 00:51:55,316
MATT: Okay. So you just bolt out.
I say rage run and barbarian speed,

963
00:51:55,316 --> 00:51:58,050
you're going to get
nearly completely out of the cavern.

964
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:01,679
LIAM: His knees 
are really high in the air!

965
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:06,619
MATT: Keyleth! Are you staying
out in shark form at the boat?

966
00:52:06,619 --> 00:52:08,078
MARISHA: Yeah, I guess.

967
00:52:08,078 --> 00:52:12,370
I feel Percy unhook,

968
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:17,380
and I start the forward momentum.

969
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:21,562
Pointing that direction?

970
00:52:21,562 --> 00:52:25,842
MATT: Okay! All right. Pike.

971
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:28,177
ASHLEY: Oh wow, I'm up so soon!
Okay, I'm going to start running!

972
00:52:28,177 --> 00:52:31,685
MATT: All right! So you turn and run.
You catch up to Grog,

973
00:52:31,685 --> 00:52:34,148
because he traveled twice the distance
that you could have

974
00:52:34,148 --> 00:52:36,549
with your tiny little gnome legs
in your full-plate armor.

975
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:37,662
You're like (grunt).

976
00:52:37,662 --> 00:52:39,258
Plus, it's sand,
so your feet are sinking with each step.

977
00:52:39,258 --> 00:52:42,926
It's rough for you to get around
because of your size and the terrain.

978
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:44,820
ASHLEY: Can I jump on his leg or back?

979
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,390
MATT: You can try to.

980
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:47,548
ASHLEY: All right.

981
00:52:47,548 --> 00:52:50,288
MATT: All right! 
Make an athletics check.

982
00:52:50,288 --> 00:52:54,181
With disadvantage,
because you're in full-plate armor.

983
00:52:54,181 --> 00:52:58,624
LIAM: Nothing's free! (laughing)
You've got to roll for everything.

984
00:52:58,624 --> 00:53:03,571
ASHLEY: All right. We got a 19.
And we got a nine.

985
00:53:03,571 --> 00:53:07,651
MATT: All right. What's your strength?
What was your athletics? Total.

986
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:09,813
ASHLEY: My athletics is a one, total.

987
00:53:09,813 --> 00:53:11,757
MATT: So that brings you to a ten.
Ten is what you needed.

988
00:53:11,757 --> 00:53:15,445
So, as you run up,
you leap and grab onto Grog's back.

989
00:53:15,445 --> 00:53:17,410
Grog, I want you to make a--

990
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:21,618
ASHLEY: Wait, no! Hold on.
I need to be honest. I rolled an eight.

991
00:53:21,618 --> 00:53:24,293
My athletics is a one,
so doesn't that make me nine?

992
00:53:24,293 --> 00:53:26,122
MATT: That makes you a nine.

993
00:53:26,122 --> 00:53:27,165
ASHLEY: Sorry.

994
00:53:27,165 --> 00:53:28,714
TRAVIS: Look at that honor code!

995
00:53:28,714 --> 00:53:31,161
LAURA: That was good,
because I was going to let it go.

996
00:53:31,161 --> 00:53:33,917
MATT: So! As you jump
to grab onto the back of Grog's back,

997
00:53:33,917 --> 00:53:35,526
you manage to find purchase.

998
00:53:35,526 --> 00:53:38,580
Grog instinctually
reaches back with an elbow

999
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,897
and hits you right in the side
of the armor,

1000
00:53:40,897 --> 00:53:42,242
which knocks you flat on your back.

1001
00:53:42,242 --> 00:53:45,004
You're currently
prone in the sand right there.

1002
00:53:45,004 --> 00:53:47,389
And Grog just keeps running.

1003
00:53:47,389 --> 00:53:50,095
You glance over your shoulder
for a second, but because you're raging,

1004
00:53:50,095 --> 00:53:52,008
you don't see her.
You just see shadows in the cavern.

1005
00:53:52,008 --> 00:53:53,441
TRAVIS: (screaming in panic)

1006
00:53:53,441 --> 00:53:56,654
MATT: So you start moving your hand
in the air, freaking out.

1007
00:53:56,654 --> 00:53:59,182
Holding your axe in one hand
and your greatsword in the other,

1008
00:53:59,182 --> 00:54:01,649
just (panicked screaming).

1009
00:54:01,649 --> 00:54:05,981
ASHLEY: (laughing) Oh my god,
that's hilarious.

1010
00:54:05,981 --> 00:54:08,611
TRAVIS: Whack! Boom! Oh my god.

1011
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:10,334
ASHLEY: That's all right. I'm tough!

1012
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:13,055
MATT: The large, ray-like, 
cloaked creature

1013
00:54:13,055 --> 00:54:16,293
swoops down towards the top of the--

1014
00:54:16,293 --> 00:54:18,704
ASHLEY: Oh, shoot.
We've got to get out of here!

1015
00:54:18,704 --> 00:54:22,410
TRAVIS: (laughing) Sorry.

1016
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:27,622
LIAM: It's a good thing we ran!
LAURA: Oh yeah. Does it even matter?

1017
00:54:27,622 --> 00:54:30,556
LAURA: No, it's just going to attack us.
LIAM: We just gave up a turn.

1018
00:54:30,556 --> 00:54:34,111
MATT: All right. It's going to make 
a bite attack against Tiberius

1019
00:54:34,111 --> 00:54:36,105
and a tail attack against Scanlan.

1020
00:54:36,105 --> 00:54:38,643
So it's the two
that are immediately visible to it.

1021
00:54:38,643 --> 00:54:42,015
So the bite attack against you, Tiberius.
That's going to be a 21.

1022
00:54:42,015 --> 00:54:44,113
ORION: Yeah, that hits.

1023
00:54:44,113 --> 00:54:48,074
MATT: The bite attack against you
is going to be a 23.

1024
00:54:48,074 --> 00:54:49,402
(all laugh)

1025
00:54:49,402 --> 00:54:53,786
MATT: The tail (whapsh) whips around
as you're on top of the carpet,

1026
00:54:53,786 --> 00:54:55,286
about to try
to get everyone out of there.

1027
00:54:55,286 --> 00:54:57,251
You turn around and see this thing
go piercing by.

1028
00:54:57,251 --> 00:54:58,864
It strikes across your chest.

1029
00:54:58,864 --> 00:55:01,731
Your armor takes most of the damage,
but you can feel the bruise underneath.

1030
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:02,794
It doesn't actually pierce the skin,

1031
00:55:02,794 --> 00:55:05,619
but you take seven points of damage
from the impact of the tail.

1032
00:55:05,619 --> 00:55:07,223
MATT: Tiberius!
ORION: Yes?

1033
00:55:07,223 --> 00:55:11,104
MATT: All right, it comes out
and sinks its teeth into your form,

1034
00:55:11,104 --> 00:55:13,859
across your shoulder area,
and it bites down. You end up taking--

1035
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:15,723
ORION: You're ruining my robe! (grunts)

1036
00:55:15,723 --> 00:55:17,662
MATT: (laughing) Ten points
of piercing damage.

1037
00:55:17,662 --> 00:55:21,070
MARISHA: Oh no.
LIAM: (squishing noise)

1038
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:24,844
MATT: And the creature wraps around you,
(squelch) completely envelops you.

1039
00:55:24,844 --> 00:55:26,798
SAM: Him, or me, or both?
MATT: Him.

1040
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:30,224
MATT: It completely surrounds you
and wraps you like a blanket.

1041
00:55:30,224 --> 00:55:33,533
All of a sudden, your vision goes dark.
You feel yourself like (muffled yelling).

1042
00:55:33,533 --> 00:55:37,496
You're unable to really move.
You are blind and unable to breathe.

1043
00:55:37,496 --> 00:55:39,893
The air is not able to get to you
at this time.

1044
00:55:39,893 --> 00:55:43,142
TRAVIS: Shit.
LIAM: It is poppycock.

1045
00:55:43,142 --> 00:55:49,272
MATT: So! That's going to end its turn.
Tiberius, your turn.

1046
00:55:49,272 --> 00:55:55,295
ORION: Well. (grunts) Fire breath!

1047
00:55:55,295 --> 00:55:58,166
MATT: Okay!
LAURA: Oh, that's good!

1048
00:55:58,166 --> 00:56:01,075
ORION: (roaring) Get off of me!

1049
00:56:01,075 --> 00:56:04,004
MATT: Because it's attached to your head,
it's going to have disadvantage.

1050
00:56:04,004 --> 00:56:08,144
So I think it's--
is it a dexterity saving throw?

1051
00:56:08,144 --> 00:56:10,629
Its head
is right by your mouth.

1052
00:56:10,629 --> 00:56:12,539
Go ahead and roll damage.

1053
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:15,891
I rolled a natural 20 and a six.

1054
00:56:15,891 --> 00:56:19,149
So because of the disadvantage,
it does not make its save.

1055
00:56:19,149 --> 00:56:24,739
ORION: So, wisdom?
LIAM: d6 times something, I think.

1056
00:56:24,739 --> 00:56:26,492
MATT: Yeah. Roll the damage
for your fire breath.

1057
00:56:26,492 --> 00:56:27,904
ORION: How many d6?
LIAM: Depends on your level.

1058
00:56:27,904 --> 00:56:29,958
MATT: Depends on your level,
as a dragonborn.

1059
00:56:29,958 --> 00:56:31,970
ORION: Oh! Hang on.
MATT: Should be on your sheet.

1060
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:34,211
ORION: Is it... no...
MATT: No, no, it's... Here, I'll...

1061
00:56:34,211 --> 00:56:35,538
MATT: No! It's part
of the dragonborn ability.

1062
00:56:35,538 --> 00:56:37,678
Let me pull it up real fast.

1063
00:56:37,678 --> 00:56:41,296
ORION: I don't want to roll wrong.
I think it's 2d6.

1064
00:56:41,296 --> 00:56:43,755
LIAM: That's for a low level.

1065
00:56:43,755 --> 00:56:46,355
LAURA: You know nothing here.
TRAVIS: Your powers are worthless.

1066
00:56:46,355 --> 00:56:47,471
SAM: If only there was a way.

1067
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:49,141
TALIESIN: If there was some book

1068
00:56:49,141 --> 00:56:51,045
that had all 
this information available.

1069
00:56:51,045 --> 00:56:52,750
MATT: It is 3d6 at 6th level.

1070
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,637
ORION: Oh! Awesome. Cool.

1071
00:56:54,637 --> 00:56:57,251
TALIESIN: Some ancient tome
which suddenly answers everything.

1072
00:56:57,251 --> 00:57:02,283
ORION: (panting in relief) 21!

1073
00:57:02,283 --> 00:57:05,989
MATT: 21 points of damage.
You all hear a muffled (explosion sound)

1074
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:07,853
as bits of flame begin to shoot out 
from the corners

1075
00:57:07,853 --> 00:57:10,121
of where it's wrapping
around the torso of Tiberius,

1076
00:57:10,121 --> 00:57:11,342
surrounding his head.

1077
00:57:11,342 --> 00:57:12,698
The creature's tail flicks around in pain.

1078
00:57:12,698 --> 00:57:17,425
You hear this muffled (screeching) sound
as it keeps, still tight around his head,

1079
00:57:17,425 --> 00:57:20,572
fighting through the damage
and maintaining its hold on him.

1080
00:57:20,572 --> 00:57:24,886
ORION: If I do something,
I'll probably have disadvantage.

1081
00:57:24,886 --> 00:57:29,663
Right? Correct?
Well, I'll just try it again.

1082
00:57:29,663 --> 00:57:35,943
I'll spend... fuck. Jeez. No!

1083
00:57:35,943 --> 00:57:38,610
LAURA: Don't spend
all your sorcerer's points!

1084
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:42,873
ORION: No, I fly around
and (ping) hit one of my stones,

1085
00:57:42,873 --> 00:57:49,113
and I'll spend...

1086
00:57:49,113 --> 00:57:52,663
five sorcerer points
to cast Telekinesis

1087
00:57:52,663 --> 00:57:55,410
and (blast sound) fling it off me.

1088
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:57,753
MATT: Okay! All right.

1089
00:57:57,753 --> 00:58:01,220
We're going to do
a contested roll on this.

1090
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:03,338
LIAM: It's a contest.
It's like an arm wrestle.

1091
00:58:03,338 --> 00:58:05,471
It's like arm wrestling with dice.

1092
00:58:05,471 --> 00:58:07,775
ORION: Oh, yeah! Arcana?

1093
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:09,646
MATT: Well, no.

1094
00:58:09,646 --> 00:58:13,050
For this, I believe it's the roll
plus your spell modifier.

1095
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:15,153
Should be five.
So roll a d20, add five to it.

1096
00:58:15,153 --> 00:58:16,208
ORION: 20.

1097
00:58:16,208 --> 00:58:17,686
MATT: 20! All right.

1098
00:58:17,686 --> 00:58:20,419
So, your Ioun stone is floating
around your head,

1099
00:58:20,419 --> 00:58:21,783
which is currently
surrounded by the creature.

1100
00:58:21,783 --> 00:58:23,020
It's clinging to your head;

1101
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:25,275
you can feel it
grinding into the top of your skull.

1102
00:58:25,275 --> 00:58:28,679
You instill the Ioun stone to trigger.

1103
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:31,691
As you do, the force begins
to pull it (grunt) off of,

1104
00:58:31,691 --> 00:58:33,702
and flings it off of your head.

1105
00:58:33,702 --> 00:58:37,639
The creature is detached and thrown back
at that point of the wall, off of you.

1106
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:39,512
ORION: (grunts) Good!

1107
00:58:39,512 --> 00:58:42,114
I use my movement
to get the hell out of there! (grunts)

1108
00:58:42,114 --> 00:58:45,339
MATT: All right. They move out that way.

1109
00:58:45,339 --> 00:58:47,053
MARISHA: Trinket, run!

1110
00:58:47,053 --> 00:58:50,453
LAURA: It's not my turn yet!
Tell him to go!

1111
00:58:50,453 --> 00:58:52,239
MATT: Scanlan, are you staying
on the carpet?

1112
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:53,634
Anything else you want to do?

1113
00:58:53,634 --> 00:58:57,340
SAM: I am staying on the carpet.
Wait! Is Pike off the carpet?

1114
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:59,937
ASHLEY: I'm laying in the dirt.
MATT: Pike's laying in the dirt right now.

1115
00:58:59,937 --> 00:59:06,260
SAM: Okay! I will jump off the carpet,
grab her, and say,

1116
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,846
"Pike. Come with me 
if you want to live."

1117
00:59:08,846 --> 00:59:11,341
(all laugh)

1118
00:59:11,341 --> 00:59:13,527
SAM: And I just hold her really tight,

1119
00:59:13,527 --> 00:59:18,069
and I sniff her hair,
and it smells like strawberries.

1120
00:59:18,069 --> 00:59:19,743
TALIESIN: Got to make it weird, man.
ASHLEY: (laughs)

1121
00:59:19,743 --> 00:59:22,400
SAM: And then I Dimension Door us
to the boat.

1122
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,542
MARISHA: Aw! That's cute!

1123
00:59:24,542 --> 00:59:26,379
MATT: As Scanlan grabs you
and holds you for a second,

1124
00:59:26,379 --> 00:59:28,073
for a moment you're confused,

1125
00:59:28,073 --> 00:59:31,015
and you hear that strange shrieking moan
in the distance,

1126
00:59:31,015 --> 00:59:34,845
and suddenly the darkness gives way
to this flash of purple arcane energy,

1127
00:59:34,845 --> 00:59:37,926
and the two of you (boof)
fall a few inches into hard wood,

1128
00:59:37,926 --> 00:59:40,286
and you feel the boat rock 
for a second

1129
00:59:40,286 --> 00:59:42,119
as you're now 
on the outside in the boat,

1130
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:43,544
being tugged by Keyleth the shark.

1131
00:59:43,544 --> 00:59:45,155
ASHLEY: Scanlan! Thanks!

1132
00:59:45,155 --> 00:59:47,207
SAM: Don't worry!
That hard wood is the boat.

1133
00:59:47,207 --> 00:59:53,209
(all laugh)

1134
00:59:53,209 --> 00:59:57,374
TRAVIS: I have to applaud.

1135
00:59:57,374 --> 01:00:00,196
MATT: Okay! Vex!

1136
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:03,411
LAURA: Trinket! Run!

1137
01:00:03,411 --> 01:00:07,031
MATT: (bear moan) Trinket runs up.
Are you staying on the carpet?

1138
01:00:07,031 --> 01:00:12,570
LAURA: I jump off the carpet,
climb on Trinket, and we take off!

1139
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:14,617
MATT: All right.

1140
01:00:14,617 --> 01:00:16,446
You jump on top of your bear,
and you start bolting down the hallway.

1141
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:21,929
All right, that ends your turn.
Clarota just (whoosh) vanishes.

1142
01:00:21,929 --> 01:00:25,994
Kima (laughing) goes running
on her halfling legs

1143
01:00:25,994 --> 01:00:27,562
towards the flying carpet.

1144
01:00:27,562 --> 01:00:29,272
She takes her full turn
and she just manages

1145
01:00:29,272 --> 01:00:30,733
to get on top of the carpet,
and that's her turn.

1146
01:00:30,733 --> 01:00:32,945
And she goes, "Go, go, go, go!"

1147
01:00:32,945 --> 01:00:33,984
ORION: I am going!

1148
01:00:33,984 --> 01:00:38,733
MATT: (laughing) All right.
So, for the time being,

1149
01:00:38,733 --> 01:00:42,565
we'll say you guys manage to
(whoosh) make your way

1150
01:00:42,565 --> 01:00:46,324
outside of the cavern to the ship.

1151
01:00:46,324 --> 01:00:49,975
SAM: For now.
TALIESIN: Up, up, up.

1152
01:00:49,975 --> 01:00:52,150
LAURA: Can you go? Oh, you're a shark.

1153
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:53,314
MATT: Being towed.

1154
01:00:53,314 --> 01:00:55,282
LAURA: Damn it!
TALIESIN: We're fine.

1155
01:00:55,282 --> 01:00:58,252
LAURA: Wonder how far this thing can fly.

1156
01:00:58,252 --> 01:01:00,445
TRAVIS: Well, we'll find out real quick.

1157
01:01:00,445 --> 01:01:03,997
TALIESIN: We have lots of ways to hurt it
before it gets there.

1158
01:01:03,997 --> 01:01:07,087
We have arrows and guns.
We're fine.

1159
01:01:07,087 --> 01:01:09,415
MATT: As you guys all get into the boat--

1160
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:13,165
MARISHA: (laughing)
Follow the Macy's Day balloon shark.

1161
01:01:13,165 --> 01:01:16,180
SAM: (shushing)
This is the craziest thing ever.

1162
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:22,246
MATT: As Keyleth begins to pull away,
the boat picks up speed into the water,

1163
01:01:22,246 --> 01:01:24,284
and you hear that moan sound
begin to get louder

1164
01:01:24,284 --> 01:01:27,297
as the creature (swoosh)
out of the cavern, giving chase.

1165
01:01:27,297 --> 01:01:28,564
TALIESIN: I take a shot.

1166
01:01:28,564 --> 01:01:31,879
MATT: All right, so!
For the purposes of this--

1167
01:01:31,879 --> 01:01:37,405
TALIESIN: You've been waiting to use this!
SAM: This is a James Bond water chase!

1168
01:01:37,405 --> 01:01:40,710
(all laugh)

1169
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:43,365
MATT: All right, so going off,
same top of the round.

1170
01:01:43,365 --> 01:01:44,442
Vax, you're up first.

1171
01:01:44,442 --> 01:01:50,276
LIAM: Okay, so I throw a dagger
at the McRay there.

1172
01:01:50,276 --> 01:01:54,230
MATT: Due to its distance,
the darkness behind it,

1173
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:55,617
and the fact that you are in a boat,

1174
01:01:55,617 --> 01:01:57,039
you are at a disadvantage
on both your attack rolls.

1175
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:59,257
LIAM: Plus I had a one on the first one.

1176
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:01,587
MATT: So you super miss on that one.

1177
01:02:01,587 --> 01:02:06,707
LIAM: No, it was a seven plus... 
13 on the second.

1178
01:02:06,707 --> 01:02:08,409
MATT: Okay, so you throw both daggers.
(whoosh whoosh)

1179
01:02:08,409 --> 01:02:11,834
Unfortunately, it's hard
to make the form of the creature.

1180
01:02:11,834 --> 01:02:14,724
It seems to almost--
I can't say change its color,

1181
01:02:14,724 --> 01:02:17,246
but it embraces the shadows around it,
and it gets harder and harder to see.

1182
01:02:17,246 --> 01:02:20,971
And for a moment, you swear 
you see two more appear at its sides.

1183
01:02:20,971 --> 01:02:23,024
LIAM: Oh. Mirror images!
SAM: Oh no.

1184
01:02:23,024 --> 01:02:25,506
MATT: You fling both daggers,
and they vanish into the darkness

1185
01:02:25,506 --> 01:02:28,076
and return to your side.
That ends your turn.

1186
01:02:28,076 --> 01:02:29,324
Percy, you're up.

1187
01:02:29,324 --> 01:02:30,182
TALIESIN: All right!

1188
01:02:30,182 --> 01:02:32,524
I'm going to take
a dead-eye sharpshooter shot.

1189
01:02:32,524 --> 01:02:34,844
I'm going hardcore with this.

1190
01:02:34,844 --> 01:02:37,756
So, with Bad News,
I'm sitting down.

1191
01:02:37,756 --> 01:02:43,952
MATT: So you've leaned
your giant sniper cannon

1192
01:02:43,952 --> 01:02:45,862
that you've constructed
up against the side of the boat,

1193
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:48,053
aim it up, best you can,
and take a shot.

1194
01:02:48,053 --> 01:02:50,319
You are at disadvantage
for this shot.

1195
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:52,553
TALIESIN: I'm at advantage
for this shot!

1196
01:02:52,553 --> 01:02:54,644
MATT: So it cancels out.
It's just a regular shot.

1197
01:02:54,644 --> 01:02:57,283
TALIESIN: Regular shot.
LIAM: Come on!

1198
01:02:57,283 --> 01:02:59,121
TALIESIN: 13.
LIAM: Beautiful human.

1199
01:02:59,121 --> 01:03:00,682
MATT: 13?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1200
01:03:00,682 --> 01:03:02,161
MATT: 13 unfortunately misses.
TALIESIN: Damn it!

1201
01:03:02,161 --> 01:03:03,241
MATT: (gun blast sound)

1202
01:03:03,241 --> 01:03:05,865
The ship actually rocks
from the impact of the explosion.

1203
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:08,759
For a second there, you all feel like 
it's going to list and take on water.

1204
01:03:08,759 --> 01:03:10,682
LAURA: Are we all on the boat,
or are some people still on the carpet?

1205
01:03:10,682 --> 01:03:12,943
ORION: No, a bunch of people
are on the carpet.

1206
01:03:12,943 --> 01:03:14,988
MATT: Who's on the carpet still?
TRAVIS: We're in the boat.

1207
01:03:14,988 --> 01:03:16,677
LAURA: We didn't all fit in the boat!

1208
01:03:16,677 --> 01:03:18,256
That's why we didn't
all take the boat originally.

1209
01:03:18,256 --> 01:03:19,748
ORION: I'm still on the carpet!

1210
01:03:19,748 --> 01:03:22,249
MATT: Okay.
Tiberius is still on the carpet.

1211
01:03:22,249 --> 01:03:26,196
LAURA: You're the only one
still on the carpet, then.

1212
01:03:26,196 --> 01:03:27,330
TRAVIS: Like I said.

1213
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:30,158
TALIESIN: By the way,
if anyone wants to make us

1214
01:03:30,158 --> 01:03:32,651
a little six-square carpet,
that would be awesome!

1215
01:03:32,651 --> 01:03:38,326
MARISHA: If someone crocheted us
a little single-square magic carpet?

1216
01:03:38,326 --> 01:03:39,742
ORION: That'd be so fun.

1217
01:03:39,742 --> 01:03:42,373
MARISHA: So we could put it
on our little floaty deal.

1218
01:03:42,373 --> 01:03:44,072
TALIESIN: And I reload.

1219
01:03:44,072 --> 01:03:46,475
MATT: So you go ahead and reload.
Yeah, that'll be your turn.

1220
01:03:46,475 --> 01:03:48,045
That comes up to Grog!

1221
01:03:48,045 --> 01:03:49,975
TRAVIS: How close is Manta Ray?

1222
01:03:49,975 --> 01:03:54,818
MATT: The creature is approximately...

1223
01:03:54,818 --> 01:03:57,658
40ish feet away, at an angle,

1224
01:03:57,658 --> 01:04:00,364
so it's about 50 feet away from you,
up in the air.

1225
01:04:00,364 --> 01:04:02,390
LAURA: How long is that chain on the axe?

1226
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:05,040
TRAVIS: I was going to do something else.

1227
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:08,001
MATT: You can try and shift your weight
to the back of the boat

1228
01:04:08,001 --> 01:04:09,826
and get closer with your movement,
if you want.

1229
01:04:09,826 --> 01:04:13,804
TRAVIS: I don't think
the chain's long enough. 50 feet long?

1230
01:04:13,804 --> 01:04:16,456
Is the Chain of Returning
long enough to get to him?

1231
01:04:16,456 --> 01:04:17,411
MATT: You can certainly try.

1232
01:04:17,411 --> 01:04:20,541
TRAVIS: (laughing) I'm going to hold off.

1233
01:04:20,541 --> 01:04:23,647
I would like to hold off,
and maybe he'll come closer,

1234
01:04:23,647 --> 01:04:25,920
since I seem to be
an intimate sort of fellow.

1235
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:30,187
MATT: All right, cool.
Keyleth. You're pulling the boat?

1236
01:04:30,187 --> 01:04:35,586
MARISHA: I'm going to use a run action,
just double speed.

1237
01:04:35,586 --> 01:04:39,165
I feel action above,
and I'm just shark instincts.

1238
01:04:39,165 --> 01:04:43,055
MATT: Okay. So you manage
to get some distance for the ship,

1239
01:04:43,055 --> 01:04:44,392
pulling it further behind.

1240
01:04:44,392 --> 01:04:46,369
MARISHA: Yeah, 
I have a swim speed of 40.

1241
01:04:46,369 --> 01:04:48,479
MATT: You're moving slower than that
because you're pulling it,

1242
01:04:48,479 --> 01:04:50,888
towing the entire boat behind you,
so you're going 20,

1243
01:04:50,888 --> 01:04:53,602
but you're putting distance 
between you and the creature,

1244
01:04:53,602 --> 01:04:54,812
for the rest of the party,

1245
01:04:54,812 --> 01:04:56,851
which makes it harder 
for it to catch up.

1246
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:59,172
All right, that brings us to Pike!

1247
01:04:59,172 --> 01:05:00,352
ASHLEY: Okay!

1248
01:05:00,352 --> 01:05:04,566
I'm going to send a Guiding Bolt 
to the flying manta ray.

1249
01:05:04,566 --> 01:05:08,479
So, I have to roll
and see if it hits?

1250
01:05:08,479 --> 01:05:11,655
MATT: Yes. Add your spell modifier to it.
Oh, you found your sheet?

1251
01:05:11,655 --> 01:05:12,972
ASHLEY: Yeah, I did.
MATT: Awesome.

1252
01:05:14,982 --> 01:05:16,230
ASHLEY: It doesn't hit. It's 12.

1253
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:17,460
MATT: 12 does not hit, unfortunately.

1254
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:19,775
Once again, you fire
and you think you hit one of them,

1255
01:05:19,775 --> 01:05:23,853
but it seems to hit one 
of the group of three

1256
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:25,413
that's now flying overhead,

1257
01:05:25,413 --> 01:05:28,012
and one shimmers and vanishes,
seemingly unaffected by the bolt,

1258
01:05:28,012 --> 01:05:29,986
but that one image of it disappears.

1259
01:05:29,986 --> 01:05:34,668
ASHLEY: Can I do anything else?
Since I'm just sitting.

1260
01:05:34,668 --> 01:05:36,250
MATT: No, not unless you want
to move somewhere in the boat.

1261
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:37,854
ASHLEY: No. Dang it!

1262
01:05:37,854 --> 01:05:41,944
MATT: All right. It's now its turn.
It is going to move.

1263
01:05:41,944 --> 01:05:52,530
It gains up on the boat
to about there.

1264
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:53,683
It actually gets a little lower.

1265
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:58,333
It's starting to gain on you guys,

1266
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:00,223
make its way (shh) gliding down
towards the front,

1267
01:06:00,223 --> 01:06:02,649
and you see now
there's now two of them side by side

1268
01:06:02,649 --> 01:06:04,904
that are coming down towards you guys.

1269
01:06:04,904 --> 01:06:07,701
SAM: Are those real?
LAURA: I don't know.

1270
01:06:07,701 --> 01:06:11,614
MATT: It's then that
that strange moaning sound it's making

1271
01:06:11,614 --> 01:06:13,968
(moans) begins to grow louder and louder,

1272
01:06:13,968 --> 01:06:17,118
and all of you close your ears
for a second.

1273
01:06:17,118 --> 01:06:18,577
Everybody, make a wisdom saving throw.

1274
01:06:18,577 --> 01:06:19,463
MARISHA: Including me?

1275
01:06:19,463 --> 01:06:22,942
MATT: You don't actually hear
in the water. You're muffled.

1276
01:06:22,942 --> 01:06:23,626
MARISHA: I'm in the water, yeah.

1277
01:06:23,626 --> 01:06:26,119
MATT: It's to the point
where it doesn't actually affect you.

1278
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:26,371
Plus, you're in shark form.

1279
01:06:26,371 --> 01:06:28,524
ORION: Oh crap, wisdom?
MATT: Yes.

1280
01:06:28,524 --> 01:06:31,419
ORION: Aw!
SAM: (laughs)

1281
01:06:31,419 --> 01:06:33,620
MATT: All right. Scanlan?

1282
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:34,917
SAM: I rolled a two,
but my wisdom is negative two.

1283
01:06:34,917 --> 01:06:36,119
(all laugh)

1284
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:41,244
SAM: So I'm at a zero.
MATT: All right. Tiberius?

1285
01:06:41,244 --> 01:06:43,121
ORION: I rolled a four.
MATT: Four. Percy?

1286
01:06:43,121 --> 01:06:44,537
TALIESIN: One.

1287
01:06:44,537 --> 01:06:49,127
MATT: One? Oh no. Grog?
LAURA: Oh no! Our whole party!

1288
01:06:49,127 --> 01:06:50,063
TRAVIS: 13.

1289
01:06:50,063 --> 01:06:51,320
ASHLEY: 12.

1290
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:52,435
LAURA: 11.

1291
01:06:52,435 --> 01:06:53,406
LIAM: 14.

1292
01:06:53,406 --> 01:06:56,098
SAM: Oh boy!
TALIESIN: We are killing it!

1293
01:06:56,098 --> 01:07:02,457
MATT: Grog and Vex.
Now let's see. You rolled a what?

1294
01:07:02,457 --> 01:07:04,105
LAURA: I rolled an 11.

1295
01:07:04,105 --> 01:07:08,258
MATT: 11? Okay, yeah, so, no.
Vax however, is okay.

1296
01:07:08,258 --> 01:07:13,978
So, Kima, Vax, and Grog, and Clarota
all hear this horrible moaning sound

1297
01:07:13,978 --> 01:07:17,077
and plug their ears and shake it off,
not a problem. Everyone else--

1298
01:07:17,077 --> 01:07:18,980
SAM: Instant peril.

1299
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:23,188
MATT: This creature-- all of a sudden,
its form becomes far more frightening

1300
01:07:23,188 --> 01:07:25,409
than you ever saw before.
It almost seems to swell with the cavern.

1301
01:07:25,409 --> 01:07:27,446
ORION: Is it casting a spell?

1302
01:07:27,446 --> 01:07:31,377
MATT: It's a natural ability.
All of you are considered frightened.

1303
01:07:31,377 --> 01:07:34,517
ORION: Oh my lord!

1304
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:37,151
SAM: Is it charming us?

1305
01:07:37,151 --> 01:07:41,239
MATT: Nope. It is not a charm effect.
It is a fear effect.

1306
01:07:41,239 --> 01:07:43,267
You are scared of it, currently.

1307
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:47,842
LAURA: Trinket is immune to being scared.

1308
01:07:47,842 --> 01:07:50,312
It doesn't matter, 
because I'm scared.

1309
01:07:50,312 --> 01:07:52,752
MATT: You're scared.
Trinket's not affected, but you are.

1310
01:07:52,752 --> 01:07:55,202
Essentially, until the end
of its next turn,

1311
01:07:55,202 --> 01:07:59,034
it's disadvantage on all attack rolls,
and you cannot move closer to it.

1312
01:07:59,034 --> 01:08:01,194
TRAVIS: Can I take that turn now?

1313
01:08:01,194 --> 01:08:03,050
MATT: You can take that turn now, yeah.
As it's moaning.

1314
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:06,565
TRAVIS: Now, since I shook it off,
I'm like, "That's lovely,"

1315
01:08:06,565 --> 01:08:11,041
and I would like to try,
for the first time, Intimidating Presence.

1316
01:08:11,041 --> 01:08:12,530
SAM: Is that a spell?

1317
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:14,992
TRAVIS: On a creature within 30 feet.

1318
01:08:14,992 --> 01:08:18,694
MATT: It would be within 30 feet.
Turn around.

1319
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:20,695
ASHLEY: Get it! 
LAURA: Get it Grog, get it!

1320
01:08:20,695 --> 01:08:22,963
TRAVIS: (yells)

1321
01:08:22,963 --> 01:08:25,213
(all laugh)

1322
01:08:25,213 --> 01:08:27,640
MATT: All right, so what's the DC on that?
TRAVIS: 13.

1323
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:30,327
MATT: 13 for what kind of saving throw?
TRAVIS: Wisdom saving throw.

1324
01:08:30,327 --> 01:08:32,259
MATT: Okay, for the creature.
Wisdom saving throw.

1325
01:08:32,259 --> 01:08:33,652
It rolls a 12.

1326
01:08:33,652 --> 01:08:35,171
(all cheer)

1327
01:08:35,171 --> 01:08:38,116
MATT: So after it does this moaning sound

1328
01:08:38,116 --> 01:08:39,892
that sends the entire boat
shaking with fear,

1329
01:08:39,892 --> 01:08:41,405
everyone grasping the side of the boat,

1330
01:08:41,405 --> 01:08:42,713
looking at each other like,
"We're going to die!"

1331
01:08:42,713 --> 01:08:45,436
Grog turns around, steps forward,

1332
01:08:45,436 --> 01:08:48,410
pushing Pike and Scanlan
to the side a little bit,

1333
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:50,581
and just glares at this creature,

1334
01:08:50,581 --> 01:08:54,954
gives a giant bestial goliath shout
(roars) out into the cavern

1335
01:08:54,954 --> 01:08:56,617
that counteracts
the moan that it's doing.

1336
01:08:56,617 --> 01:08:58,982
You can see the creature,
teeth bared, its wings out,

1337
01:08:58,982 --> 01:09:01,992
looking extremely frightening,
looks visibly shaken.

1338
01:09:01,992 --> 01:09:05,441
It begins to flap backwards
and actually get about 30 feet of distance

1339
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:07,491
between you guys
instinctually with its movement.

1340
01:09:07,491 --> 01:09:09,399
TRAVIS: That's right, bitch!

1341
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:11,651
He's frightened
until the end of the next turn.

1342
01:09:11,651 --> 01:09:14,659
LAURA: Does that cancel out our fear?

1343
01:09:14,659 --> 01:09:16,022
MATT: It doesn't cancel out yours.

1344
01:09:16,022 --> 01:09:18,807
It just means it's further away
and can't get closer to Grog.

1345
01:09:18,807 --> 01:09:20,818
SAM: But we're still scared of it.

1346
01:09:20,818 --> 01:09:22,618
MATT: You're still scared of it
until the end of its next turn,

1347
01:09:22,618 --> 01:09:24,746
but now it's keeping its distance
from the boat.

1348
01:09:24,746 --> 01:09:28,470
It was starting to catch up to you guys,
and now it's actually pulled back.

1349
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:33,021
Not wanting to get near Grog.
All right. Tiberius.

1350
01:09:33,021 --> 01:09:38,608
ORION: What's the creature made out of?
What's his skin like when I look at him?

1351
01:09:38,608 --> 01:09:40,988
MATT: It looks leathery.

1352
01:09:40,988 --> 01:09:46,894
It has almost the texture
of a very, very thick bat or lizard skin.

1353
01:09:46,894 --> 01:09:48,892
But it's very dark, from what you can see.

1354
01:09:48,892 --> 01:09:51,189
You've had just little glimpses of it
here and there.

1355
01:09:51,189 --> 01:09:53,802
Most of it's been shrouded in shadow.

1356
01:09:53,802 --> 01:09:59,862
It's almost like a thick leather cloak
that's come to life.

1357
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:05,759
ORION: Well, I don't really--

1358
01:10:05,759 --> 01:10:08,759
Hey! What do you think I should do, guys?

1359
01:10:08,759 --> 01:10:09,910
(all laugh)

1360
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:12,500
TRAVIS: Knock it into the water.
Let the shark have at it.

1361
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,465
SAM: Can you make us faster?
Can you haste her, or anything?

1362
01:10:14,465 --> 01:10:16,867
ORION: Haste doesn't work that way now.

1363
01:10:16,867 --> 01:10:20,293
LAURA: How high are the ceilings?
Can you pillars it down into the water?

1364
01:10:20,293 --> 01:10:21,419
SAM: Just defer.

1365
01:10:21,419 --> 01:10:22,507
ORION: I'll defer for now.

1366
01:10:22,507 --> 01:10:24,730
MATT: Okay, so Tiberius,
you move your movement to later.

1367
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:27,730
LIAM: We can't sail away--

1368
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:30,570
SAM: Can you shake us?
Can you shake our magic fear?

1369
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:32,613
MATT: Not unless you have
an anti-fear spell.

1370
01:10:32,613 --> 01:10:33,624
Scanlan, you're up.

1371
01:10:33,624 --> 01:10:37,206
SAM: I'm going to attack
at disadvantage, I guess, with...

1372
01:10:37,206 --> 01:10:42,973
I'm going to create a big hand
right in front of him,

1373
01:10:42,973 --> 01:10:45,204
to stall him with the Bigby's Hand.

1374
01:10:45,204 --> 01:10:46,734
ASHLEY: Talk to the hand!
MATT: All right!

1375
01:10:46,734 --> 01:10:48,032
TRAVIS: Bigby's Hand?
ORION: Bigby Hand? Nice!

1376
01:10:48,032 --> 01:10:53,469
SAM: It's this guy I know.
His name's Bigby, he has a big hand.

1377
01:10:53,469 --> 01:11:01,328
MATT: All right, so. You take your turn.
Are you just using the... which one?

1378
01:11:01,328 --> 01:11:04,506
SAM: I'm going to grapple
and try to get it into the water

1379
01:11:04,506 --> 01:11:06,082
MATT: Oh, Grasping Hand?
ASHLEY: Ooh.

1380
01:11:06,082 --> 01:11:08,333
MATT: Okay, all right. 
Attempt to grapple.

1381
01:11:08,333 --> 01:11:11,435
Use the hand's strength score
to resolve the grapple.

1382
01:11:11,435 --> 01:11:12,638
SAM: What do I do? What do I roll?

1383
01:11:12,638 --> 01:11:15,558
MATT: Strength of 26, so roll d20 + 8.

1384
01:11:15,558 --> 01:11:17,257
MARISHA: Come on!

1385
01:11:17,257 --> 01:11:23,124
SAM: I don't know what that is.
Is that a six or a nine?

1386
01:11:23,124 --> 01:11:26,812
LAURA: There should be a dot on one side.

1387
01:11:26,812 --> 01:11:28,223
SAM: It's a nine!

1388
01:11:28,223 --> 01:11:32,893
MATT: Okay, so nine plus eight. 
You're at 17.

1389
01:11:32,893 --> 01:11:38,126
Its contest was at 15.
Oh, but you are at disadvantage.

1390
01:11:38,126 --> 01:11:39,884
So roll again.

1391
01:11:39,884 --> 01:11:41,667
MARISHA: Oh, come on...
LAURA: Don't be lower.

1392
01:11:41,667 --> 01:11:43,243
SAM: 14. Yeah, I'm good.

1393
01:11:43,243 --> 01:11:46,018
MATT: Okay, so as you rear back,
your eyes squinting,

1394
01:11:46,018 --> 01:11:48,586
just scared to even do anything
with this creature,

1395
01:11:48,586 --> 01:11:49,965
you try out this new spell

1396
01:11:49,965 --> 01:11:53,096
that you've only just recently managed
to conjure to your attention.

1397
01:11:53,096 --> 01:11:54,953
SAM: (singing) Talk to the hand!

1398
01:11:54,953 --> 01:11:59,901
MATT: As Scanlan finishes singing,

1399
01:11:59,901 --> 01:12:02,063
the rippling sonic energy
from his singing

1400
01:12:02,063 --> 01:12:04,028
shoots out from in front of him
and forms this giant,

1401
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:07,582
slightly ethereal-looking 
arcane fist the size of the creature

1402
01:12:07,582 --> 01:12:11,994
that reaches out, 
grabs onto it as he's moving his hand,

1403
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:14,359
controlling it silently from a distance.

1404
01:12:14,359 --> 01:12:16,463
It grapples the creature,
holds it in place

1405
01:12:16,463 --> 01:12:19,395
as its wings are also folded on itself
and you pull down.

1406
01:12:19,395 --> 01:12:26,634
Let's see here. Grasping Hand.
All right, so you are trying to...?

1407
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:28,451
SAM: Well, I don't know.

1408
01:12:28,451 --> 01:12:31,403
Does it fall from gravity,
or does it just it stay there, locked in?

1409
01:12:31,403 --> 01:12:33,314
MATT: It's locked in
where you're holding it.

1410
01:12:33,314 --> 01:12:35,297
SAM: Okay. Then I'll just lock it there.

1411
01:12:35,297 --> 01:12:41,236
MATT: Okay, so you lock it there. Great.
You can use a bonus action to crush it.

1412
01:12:41,236 --> 01:12:43,263
SAM: Oh yeah, I can crush it.

1413
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:45,375
Yeah, I also give it a little squeeze.
A little tickle.

1414
01:12:45,375 --> 01:12:48,132
MATT: So as you're holding it in place,
you use your bonus action to squeeze it.

1415
01:12:48,132 --> 01:12:51,587
It takes 2d6 + 5 bludgeoning damage.

1416
01:12:51,587 --> 01:12:54,712
SAM: 11 plus five. 16.

1417
01:12:54,712 --> 01:12:55,827
MATT: 16, nice.

1418
01:12:55,827 --> 01:13:00,058
As it is currently held in place,
screeching (screech, crunch)

1419
01:13:00,058 --> 01:13:01,549
you hear this strange crushing sound

1420
01:13:01,549 --> 01:13:04,781
of bones breaking on the inside
of its strange form.

1421
01:13:04,781 --> 01:13:06,831
SAM: This is the strongest I've ever been!

1422
01:13:06,831 --> 01:13:07,640
(all laugh)

1423
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:10,123
MATT: All right,
and it is considered grappled,

1424
01:13:10,123 --> 01:13:11,990
which is bad for a creature like that.

1425
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:14,313
That ends Scanlan's turn. Vex.

1426
01:13:14,313 --> 01:13:15,629
LAURA: Hunter's Mark!

1427
01:13:15,629 --> 01:13:18,689
MATT: All right,
you Hunter's Mark the creature.

1428
01:13:18,689 --> 01:13:23,178
LAURA: And I'm going to attack him twice!
Because I'm original.

1429
01:13:24,838 --> 01:13:27,838
TRAVIS: I have one thing I do.

1430
01:13:27,838 --> 01:13:29,368
LAURA: 16.

1431
01:13:29,368 --> 01:13:31,606
MATT: 16 does hit.

1432
01:13:31,606 --> 01:13:34,907
LAURA: And 28.

1433
01:13:34,907 --> 01:13:37,274
MATT: All right.
Technically, because it's grappled--

1434
01:13:37,274 --> 01:13:39,590
LIAM: Does it cancel out the disadvantage?

1435
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:43,290
MATT: It does not, technically.
It just means he can move it,

1436
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:45,045
so yeah, it does not
cancel out the disadvantage.

1437
01:13:45,045 --> 01:13:46,368
LAURA: Oh, so I've got to roll
a couple more times?

1438
01:13:46,368 --> 01:13:47,464
MATT: Yeah.

1439
01:13:49,144 --> 01:13:50,464
LAURA: They both hit. They're both high.

1440
01:13:50,464 --> 01:13:51,819
MATT: Okay, great. There you go.

1441
01:13:51,819 --> 01:13:54,279
So, as you're on the boat,
you can see the hand grasping.

1442
01:13:54,279 --> 01:13:55,941
It gives you a moment of bravery.

1443
01:13:55,941 --> 01:13:58,691
You pull out (swoosh, swoosh)
let loose two more arrows

1444
01:13:58,691 --> 01:14:01,184
into the slightly dark,
shrouded exterior of the boat.

1445
01:14:01,184 --> 01:14:02,806
Both arrows strike true

1446
01:14:02,806 --> 01:14:06,149
into the currently-grappled
cloak-like creature.

1447
01:14:06,149 --> 01:14:09,515
LAURA: 26 for those two.
Plus Hunter's Mark.

1448
01:14:09,515 --> 01:14:15,169
Oh, wait! No, 30 for those two.

1449
01:14:15,169 --> 01:14:18,169
And 9 for Hunter's Mark.

1450
01:14:18,169 --> 01:14:23,478
MATT: Nice. Portions of it are trying 
to squeeze free of this arcane hand.

1451
01:14:23,478 --> 01:14:26,402
One strikes through its wing,
leaving a gaping wound in the middle,

1452
01:14:26,402 --> 01:14:27,292
where you can see

1453
01:14:27,292 --> 01:14:30,011
it's going to have a hard time
maintaining height at this point.

1454
01:14:30,011 --> 01:14:31,034
The second one strikes it

1455
01:14:31,034 --> 01:14:32,772
and actually pierces 
one of its red, glowing eyes.

1456
01:14:32,772 --> 01:14:36,114
It gives out this horrible, 
painful screeching sound (screech)

1457
01:14:36,114 --> 01:14:37,118
into the cavern

1458
01:14:37,118 --> 01:14:40,614
as you can now see what was once
two gleaming red, piercing eyes,

1459
01:14:40,614 --> 01:14:42,933
left with only one,

1460
01:14:42,933 --> 01:14:44,078
and darkness
on the other side of its face.

1461
01:14:44,078 --> 01:14:45,930
TRAVIS: Yes! Yes!
ASHLEY: Ooh!

1462
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:48,230
MATT: That brings us 
to Kima and Clarota.

1463
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:51,995
Kima, at this point in time is,
unfortunately, at a disadvantage

1464
01:14:51,995 --> 01:14:55,185
of finding out what to do
at this distance, being a paladin.

1465
01:14:55,185 --> 01:14:56,293
She is going to attempt--

1466
01:14:56,293 --> 01:14:57,913
TRAVIS: The middle finger.

1467
01:14:57,913 --> 01:15:00,155
MATT: Nothing.
She's going to wait it out.

1468
01:15:00,155 --> 01:15:04,804
ORION: I see what happens.

1469
01:15:04,804 --> 01:15:06,259
MATT: So you're taking your turn
after Laura?

1470
01:15:06,259 --> 01:15:08,719
ORION: Yes. I'll follow suit.

1471
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:12,403
I'm going to...

1472
01:15:12,403 --> 01:15:16,079
I'm going to straight-up cast this
because I have to.

1473
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:20,135
I cast Telekinesis
and I pull the eye out. (sucking noise)

1474
01:15:20,135 --> 01:15:23,160
LAURA: Ew.
TRAVIS: Kill Bill-style, right?

1475
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:25,109
MATT: Interesting! Okay.

1476
01:15:25,109 --> 01:15:28,805
So Clarota, at this time,

1477
01:15:28,805 --> 01:15:31,033
is also going to attempt a Mind Blast
on the creature.

1478
01:15:31,033 --> 01:15:32,816
It moves to the back of the boat

1479
01:15:32,816 --> 01:15:36,386
and while it's currently grappled,
he's going to attempt that.

1480
01:15:36,386 --> 01:15:40,136
The saving throw does succeed,
so it only takes half damage.

1481
01:15:42,376 --> 01:15:44,772
Okay. Marking that.

1482
01:15:44,772 --> 01:15:50,237
And then as you do Telekinesis.
Roll a d20 plus five.

1483
01:15:50,237 --> 01:15:53,722
ORION: Okay. And do I have advantage
because of the grapple?

1484
01:15:53,722 --> 01:15:55,520
MATT: The grapple
does not give you advantage, no.

1485
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,317
So you have disadvantage
on the roll, technically,

1486
01:15:57,317 --> 01:15:58,878
because you are scared of it.

1487
01:15:58,878 --> 01:16:00,489
ORION: And that's my what?
MATT: Plus five.

1488
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:01,863
ORION: 17.

1489
01:16:01,863 --> 01:16:07,151
MATT: 17? All right. So!
As you focus your energy once again--

1490
01:16:07,151 --> 01:16:09,763
even just facing this creature
is a terrifying thing--

1491
01:16:09,763 --> 01:16:13,430
you see that one gleaming bit of red
that's piercing through the darkness.

1492
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:17,998
The secondary form around it dissipates.

1493
01:16:17,998 --> 01:16:21,935
Where there was once two gliding,
one of them vanishes entirely

1494
01:16:21,935 --> 01:16:26,448
as that gleaming red
is suddenly much brighter,

1495
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:27,870
yanked from its socket.

1496
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:30,235
It now gives out
another painful screech (screeches)

1497
01:16:30,235 --> 01:16:34,576
as it is blinded,
being crushed by a Bigby Hand,

1498
01:16:34,576 --> 01:16:38,555
and you now have drifting amongst you
at your control

1499
01:16:38,555 --> 01:16:40,550
one of the eyes of this creature.

1500
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:41,786
(all laugh)

1501
01:16:41,786 --> 01:16:43,919
LAURA: Put it in a little vial.
Keep it for later.

1502
01:16:43,919 --> 01:16:47,014
ORION: I'm going to float it over
and put it in one of my vials.

1503
01:16:47,014 --> 01:16:51,299
MATT: Okay. Write down in your inventory,
"cloaker eye."

1504
01:16:51,299 --> 01:16:53,890
ORION: I'm going to smell it,
first of all.

1505
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:56,773
ORION: No.
LAURA: Not good.

1506
01:16:56,773 --> 01:16:59,300
TALIESIN: You know exactly
where that's been.

1507
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:04,268
MATT: This guy's not having a good day.
Vax, you're up.

1508
01:17:04,268 --> 01:17:06,794
LIAM: All right. Dagger, dagger,
thunk, thunk.

1509
01:17:06,794 --> 01:17:12,091
But at disadvantage
because of the dark. I'm not afraid.

1510
01:17:12,091 --> 01:17:16,750
MATT: Well, no. You resisted the fear.
You have low light, so you're fine.

1511
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:19,860
LIAM: Okay. First one is 26.
MATT: Hits.

1512
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:21,490
LIAM: Second one is 26.

1513
01:17:21,490 --> 01:17:25,307
MATT: Hits. Because it is blinded,
you do have advantage on it--

1514
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:27,534
not advantage;
you are able to sneak attack.

1515
01:17:27,534 --> 01:17:30,123
LIAM: Sneak attack. All right, okay.

1516
01:17:30,123 --> 01:17:34,460
MATT: It's currently held aloft,
grappled by the hand.

1517
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:37,068
It has no visual sight, currently.

1518
01:17:37,068 --> 01:17:39,767
SAM: I've no idea
what we're even fighting.

1519
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:49,497
LIAM: 23.

1520
01:17:49,497 --> 01:17:51,807
MATT: All right.
How do you want to do this?

1521
01:17:51,807 --> 01:17:53,279
MARISHA: (cheers)

1522
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:56,480
LIAM: I saw where Tiberius
pulled the eye out,

1523
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:59,456
and that's what I'm aiming at,
its eye socket.

1524
01:17:59,456 --> 01:18:01,620
So I flip it in the air,
and when I catch it,

1525
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:05,105
I immediately let go
and fill in the blank.

1526
01:18:05,105 --> 01:18:06,868
MATT: Okay!
SAM: "Socket" to me.

1527
01:18:06,868 --> 01:18:09,787
MATT: So as the creature is flailing about
in torturous pain,

1528
01:18:09,787 --> 01:18:12,396
suddenly the dagger (fwoosh, thunk)

1529
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:14,825
sinks into the empty socket
in the front of its face.

1530
01:18:14,825 --> 01:18:17,376
As it does, its body tenses up
and reaches out

1531
01:18:17,376 --> 01:18:19,376
against the force of your arcane hand.

1532
01:18:19,376 --> 01:18:21,190
You actually have to focus
to keep it in place

1533
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:22,343
in its final death throes.

1534
01:18:22,343 --> 01:18:27,037
All of its tension
and then it falls limp within your grasp.

1535
01:18:27,037 --> 01:18:29,679
You now have this limp creature
at your disposal.

1536
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:31,409
SAM: Oh, I'm going to bring him
to the boat.

1537
01:18:31,409 --> 01:18:35,805
MATT: As Scanlan slowly drifts over
the limp body of this creature

1538
01:18:35,805 --> 01:18:37,222
to the edge of the boat--

1539
01:18:37,222 --> 01:18:39,963
LAURA: What was it? Can we loot him?

1540
01:18:39,963 --> 01:18:40,966
(all laugh)

1541
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:44,111
LAURA: Does he have teeth and scales
and neat things?

1542
01:18:44,111 --> 01:18:46,774
LIAM: It's a cloaker,
because that was a cloaker's eye.

1543
01:18:46,774 --> 01:18:50,054
TALIESIN: Can we fashion it into a sail?

1544
01:18:50,054 --> 01:18:51,929
SAM: That's a good idea.

1545
01:18:51,929 --> 01:18:55,268
MATT: There is no wind in this tunnel.

1546
01:18:55,268 --> 01:18:57,322
MARISHA: I can make one.

1547
01:18:57,322 --> 01:18:59,787
SAM, TALIESIN, AND LAURA:
We can make wind.

1548
01:18:59,787 --> 01:19:02,467
ASHLEY: We do have an Air Ashari.
LAURA: We have a Grog.

1549
01:19:02,467 --> 01:19:04,955
TRAVIS: Oh, we can make wind.
TALIESIN: Grog will make wind.

1550
01:19:04,955 --> 01:19:07,391
ORION: I rolled a 16
for a history check on the creature.

1551
01:19:07,391 --> 01:19:09,535
MATT: History's not
going to do much for you.

1552
01:19:09,535 --> 01:19:10,898
Nature is
what you're going to want to do.

1553
01:19:10,898 --> 01:19:14,455
Nature or arcana, those are the two.

1554
01:19:14,455 --> 01:19:17,818
ORION: So that's 14. Oh, no. Arcana?
MATT: Roll for arcana.

1555
01:19:17,818 --> 01:19:21,945
ORION: Yeah. 25.

1556
01:19:21,945 --> 01:19:25,169
MATT: Yep. This creature is a cloaker.
It's an aberration.

1557
01:19:25,169 --> 01:19:30,197
It's one of those creatures
that drifts over from the Far Realm,

1558
01:19:30,197 --> 01:19:32,277
or at some point in time
drifted over from the Far Realm

1559
01:19:32,277 --> 01:19:36,357
and is an unnatural entity to this plane.
They normally live subterranean.

1560
01:19:36,357 --> 01:19:39,620
When not moving,
they are nearly invisible and blend in,

1561
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:42,998
almost like a straight leather cloak
left and discarded to the side,

1562
01:19:42,998 --> 01:19:44,903
hence the name "cloaker."

1563
01:19:44,903 --> 01:19:46,607
TALIESIN: I've got a great idea.

1564
01:19:46,607 --> 01:19:48,950
I want to sit,
and I want to skin this thing.

1565
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:51,291
ORION: Well, yes. I want the teeth, also.

1566
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:53,633
TALIESIN: You can have the teeth.
I'm going to skin it.

1567
01:19:53,633 --> 01:19:55,841
MATT: Okay. So you guys are now
currently in this boat,

1568
01:19:55,841 --> 01:19:58,565
drifting along in the open area
over on that side.

1569
01:19:58,565 --> 01:20:00,945
LAURA: Should we make our way
to the little island?

1570
01:20:00,945 --> 01:20:03,161
TALIESIN: Or we could go
to those strange buildings

1571
01:20:03,161 --> 01:20:05,311
that are off in the northwest corner.

1572
01:20:05,311 --> 01:20:07,227
LAURA: All the way up and over?

1573
01:20:07,227 --> 01:20:10,347
MARISHA: Oh, well, I was going to say
we could go into this cave here.

1574
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:13,588
SAM: Maybe move it this way
so the people can see.

1575
01:20:13,588 --> 01:20:15,308
LAURA: Oh yeah,
it's right on the edge.

1576
01:20:15,308 --> 01:20:17,473
TALIESIN: Keep going. There you go.

1577
01:20:17,473 --> 01:20:19,791
MARISHA: Well, what about this cave?

1578
01:20:19,791 --> 01:20:22,775
LAURA: The only thing is,

1579
01:20:22,775 --> 01:20:28,205
I'm afraid that if we keep using up
all our spells,

1580
01:20:28,205 --> 01:20:31,189
then we won't be able to take down
the big baddie if we come to him.

1581
01:20:31,189 --> 01:20:34,545
MARISHA: We need a rest.
LAURA AND ASHLEY: We need rest.

1582
01:20:34,545 --> 01:20:37,302
MARISHA: I want to be able
to use my scrying spell

1583
01:20:37,302 --> 01:20:38,844
before we try anything.

1584
01:20:38,844 --> 01:20:42,461
LAURA: Oh, okay.
So should we make our way to this cave?

1585
01:20:42,461 --> 01:20:43,864
MARISHA: Sure.
TRAVIS: Good, we'll do that.

1586
01:20:43,864 --> 01:20:46,883
ORION: How close are we?
How long will that take?

1587
01:20:46,883 --> 01:20:48,623
MATT: If you guys start heading
that direction, you'll find out.

1588
01:20:48,623 --> 01:20:50,562
TALIESIN: Let's start
heading that direction,

1589
01:20:50,562 --> 01:20:52,585
and I want to skin this creature.

1590
01:20:52,585 --> 01:20:54,598
MATT: Okay, as you guys are moving along,
you leave a little space for Percy.

1591
01:20:54,598 --> 01:20:56,649
It's a little unwieldy in the ship.

1592
01:20:56,649 --> 01:20:59,171
It's hard for you to do this,
so it's not going to be the best job.

1593
01:20:59,171 --> 01:21:01,916
TALIESIN: Not going for craftsmanship.

1594
01:21:01,916 --> 01:21:05,039
MATT: Fair enough. As you're plucking
what you think might be interesting

1595
01:21:05,039 --> 01:21:07,318
from this creature's body,
as in the process of skinning it,

1596
01:21:07,318 --> 01:21:10,483
you probably take a moment to realize
that a normal blade

1597
01:21:10,483 --> 01:21:12,590
is going to have a hard time
cutting through its hide,

1598
01:21:12,590 --> 01:21:14,636
so you might have to borrow one.

1599
01:21:14,636 --> 01:21:18,322
SAM: I sing a little song to inspire him.

1600
01:21:18,322 --> 01:21:24,715
I sing, "When you're trying 
to skin a cloaker,

1601
01:21:24,715 --> 01:21:27,883
"here's some inspiration.

1602
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:33,220
"When we're on a creepy boat,
here's some inspiration.

1603
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:36,903
"I want you to be near me--"
(speaking) All right, that's it.

1604
01:21:36,903 --> 01:21:38,634
(all laugh)

1605
01:21:38,634 --> 01:21:41,681
MATT: Right, so you gain
a d10 inspiration dice.

1606
01:21:41,681 --> 01:21:44,919
TALIESIN: I'm making a camo canopy
for the boat.

1607
01:21:44,919 --> 01:21:51,148
MATT: Yeah, this is going to be
a survival check on this. Roll survival.

1608
01:21:51,148 --> 01:21:56,380
ORION: I rolled a natural 20
to help him with any arcana enchantment

1609
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:59,030
if he succceeds.

1610
01:21:59,030 --> 01:22:00,420
TALIESIN: 17.

1611
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:02,201
MATT: 17? Did you
add the inspiration dice to that?

1612
01:22:02,201 --> 01:22:03,448
TALIESIN: I didn't.

1613
01:22:03,448 --> 01:22:04,412
MATT: You don't have to
if you don't want to.

1614
01:22:04,412 --> 01:22:05,545
TALIESIN: I'm keeping it for later.
MATT: Okay.

1615
01:22:05,545 --> 01:22:06,884
SAM: No, it only lasts ten minutes.

1616
01:22:06,884 --> 01:22:08,526
TALIESIN: Oh, does it
only last ten minutes?

1617
01:22:08,526 --> 01:22:10,029
ORION: A lot can happen in ten minutes.

1618
01:22:10,029 --> 01:22:12,774
TALIESIN: Oh, in that case, 26.

1619
01:22:12,774 --> 01:22:18,071
MATT: 26 would make a difference.
In the confined space on this ship,

1620
01:22:18,071 --> 01:22:21,363
as you guys crest around
towards the northern side of that island,

1621
01:22:21,363 --> 01:22:23,281
you begin to move around.
You can see to the right of you,

1622
01:22:23,281 --> 01:22:28,546
there is this tunnel
that filters out the side of this cavern

1623
01:22:28,546 --> 01:22:30,969
that's just a continuation of the water,
a river on the far end.

1624
01:22:30,969 --> 01:22:33,047
You don't know where it goes.
It disappears in the darkness,

1625
01:22:33,047 --> 01:22:36,082
and you can hear in the distance
the light sound of rushing water.

1626
01:22:36,082 --> 01:22:42,690
MARISHA: Can I use my shark eyes
to look down the tunnel?

1627
01:22:42,690 --> 01:22:45,340
MATT: It begins to curve
about 20 feet in,

1628
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:48,178
so you're unable to make much
past that distance,

1629
01:22:48,178 --> 01:22:50,903
and it looks like a continuation
of the water flowing through, or into;

1630
01:22:50,903 --> 01:22:52,636
you're not quite able to tell
from this distance.

1631
01:22:52,636 --> 01:22:54,199
TALIESIN: (singing)
Nobody knows what it's like--

1632
01:22:54,199 --> 01:22:56,029
TALIESIN AND MARISHA: (singing)
To be a shark man.

1633
01:22:56,029 --> 01:22:58,152
MATT, ORION, AND SAM: (laugh)

1634
01:22:58,152 --> 01:23:02,116
MATT: Percy. You manage to pull from it
all the teeth in the process.

1635
01:23:02,116 --> 01:23:03,855
TALIESIN: For you.

1636
01:23:03,855 --> 01:23:06,699
MATT: So that comes to roughly
45 cloaker teeth.

1637
01:23:06,699 --> 01:23:10,250
You don't know what that'll be worth,
but you have that at your disposal.

1638
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:13,851
So you can write down,
"45 cloaker teeth."

1639
01:23:13,851 --> 01:23:16,506
You manage to skin most of it.

1640
01:23:16,506 --> 01:23:19,862
You get most of the top of its hide 
usable. It's still wet.

1641
01:23:19,862 --> 01:23:23,432
It'll take a while to do that,

1642
01:23:23,432 --> 01:23:25,688
let alone in an area
where it's dry on the surface.

1643
01:23:25,688 --> 01:23:28,410
But you manage to pull
most of the top of it off,

1644
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:30,930
so you have this wet, skinned portion
of the back of the cloaker

1645
01:23:30,930 --> 01:23:32,350
at your disposal.

1646
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:35,487
TALIESIN: I'm going to build
a relative canopy

1647
01:23:35,487 --> 01:23:37,520
specifically for the left side
of the boat

1648
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:40,009
so that we're protected

1649
01:23:40,009 --> 01:23:42,869
and visibly obscured
from anybody in the city.

1650
01:23:42,869 --> 01:23:44,977
MATT: Okay. Make a tinker check.

1651
01:23:44,977 --> 01:23:46,531
TALIESIN: What's the bonus on that, again?

1652
01:23:46,531 --> 01:23:49,932
MATT: Well, for that,
it should be dex, I believe.

1653
01:23:49,932 --> 01:23:53,483
TALIESIN: Dex, thank you.
(raspberry noise)

1654
01:23:53,483 --> 01:23:55,861
MATT: Plus four,
because you're proficient with it.

1655
01:23:55,861 --> 01:23:58,119
So it's your dex
plus your proficiency modifier.

1656
01:23:58,119 --> 01:24:00,190
TALIESIN: That's 11.

1657
01:24:00,190 --> 01:24:01,479
MATT: 11?

1658
01:24:01,479 --> 01:24:02,988
TALIESIN: I rolled really badly.

1659
01:24:02,988 --> 01:24:06,961
MATT: Yeah, you did.
You still have the hide.

1660
01:24:06,961 --> 01:24:09,292
In the time it takes
for you to get to the beach,

1661
01:24:09,292 --> 01:24:11,648
you don't have much material
at your disposal,

1662
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:13,587
and to fashion anything
that's on that side,

1663
01:24:13,587 --> 01:24:15,603
the most you manage to get
is a slight lift to it,

1664
01:24:15,603 --> 01:24:18,247
and by the time you get to the beach,
it just collapses on itself.

1665
01:24:18,247 --> 01:24:20,661
TALIESIN: Okay. Once we're at the beach
and we have all evening,

1666
01:24:20,661 --> 01:24:21,846
I'll make another attempt.

1667
01:24:21,846 --> 01:24:26,195
MATT: Okay, it'll take you some time.
It's doable, but it'll take a while.

1668
01:24:26,195 --> 01:24:28,930
TALIESIN: I had a two.
ASHLEY: It's okay.

1669
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:31,045
TRAVIS: We made our way to the beach.

1670
01:24:31,045 --> 01:24:34,756
MATT: As you make your way
towards the beach,

1671
01:24:34,756 --> 01:24:38,443
Keyleth, you see in the distance
in the water what looks like

1672
01:24:38,443 --> 01:24:41,330
something slinking on the very bottom
of this underground lake.

1673
01:24:41,330 --> 01:24:43,734
Probably a good 50, 60 feet down,

1674
01:24:43,734 --> 01:24:48,405
you can barely make out
what looks like a dark form,

1675
01:24:48,405 --> 01:24:53,584
probably about 100 to 150 feet away,
and it's only because of your shark form

1676
01:24:53,584 --> 01:24:55,913
that you're able to make out
any sort of semblance of it,

1677
01:24:55,913 --> 01:24:56,851
but it looks big,

1678
01:24:56,851 --> 01:24:59,502
and it looks like it's slowly moving
through the bottom of the lake.

1679
01:24:59,502 --> 01:25:01,018
Doesn't seem to be moving towards you.

1680
01:25:01,018 --> 01:25:04,404
ORION: It's just a thing.
There's going to be things here.

1681
01:25:04,404 --> 01:25:09,081
SAM: What if it's just like
one of those party cruises where they--

1682
01:25:09,081 --> 01:25:11,751
TRAVIS: On the bottom of the--

1683
01:25:11,751 --> 01:25:13,892
TALIESIN: Submersive party cruise.

1684
01:25:13,892 --> 01:25:16,178
LAURA: How close are we to the cave?
Are we still really far away?

1685
01:25:16,178 --> 01:25:19,757
MATT: You guys are maybe 300 feet
from the beach.

1686
01:25:19,757 --> 01:25:25,338
SAM: But we don't see it
because we're on deck, right?

1687
01:25:25,338 --> 01:25:27,709
MATT: The creature?
No, only Keyleth does.

1688
01:25:27,709 --> 01:25:29,231
MARISHA: I drop them off at the beach.

1689
01:25:29,231 --> 01:25:31,799
TALIESIN: Let's dry-dock the boat.

1690
01:25:31,799 --> 01:25:36,463
MATT: Okay, I'm going to ask Keyleth
to make a stealth check in shark form.

1691
01:25:36,463 --> 01:25:39,649
TALIESIN: A shark stealth. Stealth shark.

1692
01:25:39,649 --> 01:25:45,271
MATT: The dex bonus of a shark form 
is zero, so just roll a d20.

1693
01:25:45,271 --> 01:25:48,219
MARISHA: That's not true. It's +1.

1694
01:25:48,219 --> 01:25:54,402
MATT: Giant shark? According to here...
it says one. It's a zero. Dex is 11.

1695
01:25:54,402 --> 01:25:57,948
MARISHA: Oh, I was looking at mine.
SAM: Shark argument!

1696
01:25:57,948 --> 01:25:59,751
MARISHA: It's okay. 17.

1697
01:25:59,751 --> 01:26:00,556
MATT: 17, okay.

1698
01:26:00,556 --> 01:26:03,831
As you deftly drag the boat
at just the right distance

1699
01:26:03,831 --> 01:26:07,147
to curve around 
this large subterranean form,

1700
01:26:07,147 --> 01:26:10,615
it doesn't seem to take notice,
and eventually drifts far enough away

1701
01:26:10,615 --> 01:26:13,578
where you can no longer make any sort 
of visual connection with its form.

1702
01:26:13,578 --> 01:26:16,450
You make your way
to the side of the beach.

1703
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:18,783
You drag up to the point
where the ship begins to hit the gravel.

1704
01:26:18,783 --> 01:26:21,169
You begin to move, curve to the side,
and it (grinding sound) lifts up

1705
01:26:21,169 --> 01:26:22,861
and comes to a rest
at the top of the gravel beach.

1706
01:26:22,861 --> 01:26:24,560
You guys all step off the boat.

1707
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:27,274
Okay, Grog, you go ahead
and haul the boat up.

1708
01:26:27,274 --> 01:26:28,549
LAURA: I'm going to cast 
Pass Without a Trace

1709
01:26:28,549 --> 01:26:29,415
on all of us right now.

1710
01:26:29,415 --> 01:26:30,382
MATT: Okay.

1711
01:26:30,382 --> 01:26:33,637
MARISHA: I go ahead and un-shark myself.

1712
01:26:33,637 --> 01:26:34,853
MATT: Okay.

1713
01:26:34,853 --> 01:26:37,035
LIAM: And I'm going to look
for bad things on the beach.

1714
01:26:37,035 --> 01:26:40,425
SAM: Yeah, what's the layout of the beach?
Is it just a beach?

1715
01:26:40,425 --> 01:26:45,998
MATT: Okay, so looking at the beach here,
it's an open beach.

1716
01:26:45,998 --> 01:26:48,215
You can see
there are a few rock formations,

1717
01:26:48,215 --> 01:26:51,685
small 15-foot-tall portions
of stalagmites or stone

1718
01:26:51,685 --> 01:26:55,036
that either have been here for a long time

1719
01:26:55,036 --> 01:26:58,901
or have been constructed or put there
to jut out of that part of the beach.

1720
01:26:58,901 --> 01:27:00,768
But for the most part,
it's just an open gravel beach

1721
01:27:00,768 --> 01:27:03,271
that slowly comes to stop
at the edge of the cavern,

1722
01:27:03,271 --> 01:27:07,093
and there is a tunnel
about 15, 20 feet wide ahead of you.

1723
01:27:07,093 --> 01:27:10,684
SAM: Is there a half-submerged
Statue of Liberty, or anything?

1724
01:27:10,684 --> 01:27:12,854
MATT: Perception check?

1725
01:27:12,854 --> 01:27:15,567
(all laugh)

1726
01:27:15,567 --> 01:27:17,045
SAM: I got a 16 for my perception.

1727
01:27:17,045 --> 01:27:20,082
MATT: 16. You do not see any sort
of half-submerged Statue of Liberty.

1728
01:27:20,082 --> 01:27:20,992
My apologies.

1729
01:27:20,992 --> 01:27:25,159
LIAM: How far away are we
from the main island?

1730
01:27:25,159 --> 01:27:27,577
Is it like DUMBO to Manhattan distance?

1731
01:27:27,577 --> 01:27:33,546
MATT: Yeah, I'd say it's probably
about a good half a mile or so.

1732
01:27:33,546 --> 01:27:36,138
TRAVIS: I would like to perceive

1733
01:27:36,138 --> 01:27:37,795
if Lady Kima
has been giving me any second looks

1734
01:27:37,795 --> 01:27:40,065
after I intimidated old Flappy Wings.

1735
01:27:40,065 --> 01:27:42,534
MATT: Make a perception check.

1736
01:27:42,534 --> 01:27:47,505
TRAVIS: Ten, plus... probably nothing.
Yeah, nothing. Ten.

1737
01:27:47,505 --> 01:27:48,586
MATT: It's hard to tell.

1738
01:27:48,586 --> 01:27:50,951
She seems very focused 
on the task at hand.

1739
01:27:50,951 --> 01:27:52,560
Her eyes have been, for the most part,
up in the air around you.

1740
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:53,649
Unfortunately, Grog, you don't think

1741
01:27:53,649 --> 01:27:55,367
she's paying much mind to you
at the moment

1742
01:27:55,367 --> 01:27:57,260
because she's more concerned
about keeping the group alive

1743
01:27:57,260 --> 01:27:59,260
and where you guys are currently headed.

1744
01:27:59,260 --> 01:28:02,903
You'll have to try harder
to get her attentions.

1745
01:28:02,903 --> 01:28:05,087
It's okay, Grog.

1746
01:28:05,087 --> 01:28:06,960
LAURA: Can we look around the entrance

1747
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,277
and see if anything dangerous
looks like it's around?

1748
01:28:08,277 --> 01:28:10,539
I'm looking up on the ceiling.

1749
01:28:10,539 --> 01:28:14,378
MATT: Yeah, now that you know the idea
of what to look for, for a cloaker,

1750
01:28:14,378 --> 01:28:15,926
go ahead and make a perception check.

1751
01:28:19,386 --> 01:28:21,111
LIAM: 29.

1752
01:28:21,111 --> 01:28:23,980
MATT: Okay. You guys glance around and,

1753
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:26,882
currently looking at the walls
on the exterior of this beach area,

1754
01:28:26,882 --> 01:28:31,210
nothing matches the description
of what you saw in the previous cavern.

1755
01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:32,370
For the time being,

1756
01:28:32,370 --> 01:28:33,989
it looks relatively safe
on this part of the beach.

1757
01:28:33,989 --> 01:28:35,939
LAURA: Okay.
LIAM: And there's caves?

1758
01:28:35,939 --> 01:28:38,339
MATT: There is a singular cave
on the far end.

1759
01:28:38,339 --> 01:28:42,103
There's a slight outcropping,
and then it leads into

1760
01:28:42,103 --> 01:28:45,179
that one 20-foot-wide cavern
that goes deeper in there.

1761
01:28:45,179 --> 01:28:47,055
LIAM: I'm going to creep up
just to the edge of the cave.

1762
01:28:47,055 --> 01:28:48,245
I'm not going to go in.

1763
01:28:48,245 --> 01:28:50,685
Is it a separate perception check
for the inside of the cave as well?

1764
01:28:50,685 --> 01:28:52,028
MATT: Yes.

1765
01:28:52,028 --> 01:28:53,281
LIAM: All right.

1766
01:28:53,281 --> 01:28:54,773
MATT: You want to make a stealth check
one more time?

1767
01:28:54,773 --> 01:28:55,974
Stealth check first.

1768
01:28:55,974 --> 01:29:00,844
LIAM: Stealth check is good.
It's a 21. 31.

1769
01:29:00,844 --> 01:29:02,664
MATT: 31, okay.
So making your way up,

1770
01:29:02,664 --> 01:29:05,256
you dodge from low
on the side of the beach,

1771
01:29:05,256 --> 01:29:06,962
jumping in front
of these strange stone platforms,

1772
01:29:06,962 --> 01:29:09,002
keeping in, look for cover.

1773
01:29:09,002 --> 01:29:10,678
You make your way up
against the side of a wall,

1774
01:29:10,678 --> 01:29:13,261
begin to glance inside.
Make a perception check.

1775
01:29:13,261 --> 01:29:16,380
LIAM: And that is 19.

1776
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:20,360
MATT: 19. It's pitch-black in the cavern.
You have no light source, unfortunately.

1777
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,676
You have darkvision,
which does help you to a certain extent.

1778
01:29:22,676 --> 01:29:24,223
You cannot see
the entirety of the cavern,

1779
01:29:24,223 --> 01:29:29,510
but you can see about,
let's say, 40 to 60 feet in.

1780
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:34,067
The beach gravel comes to a halt

1781
01:29:34,067 --> 01:29:37,697
and comes to this smooth stone flooring.

1782
01:29:37,697 --> 01:29:40,091
You don't see anything
that particularly catches your attention.

1783
01:29:40,091 --> 01:29:42,233
LIAM: Manufactured or made,
or just paved floor?

1784
01:29:42,233 --> 01:29:46,630
MATT: It looks like it has
some natural change in the topography.

1785
01:29:46,630 --> 01:29:50,623
It's not a polished floor, 
but it's definitely been worn over time.

1786
01:29:50,623 --> 01:29:55,849
LAURA: Can we maybe try to look in?
ORION: Could be a tide cave.

1787
01:29:55,849 --> 01:29:57,386
TRAVIS: We have firewood bundles 
and stuff.

1788
01:29:57,386 --> 01:30:00,426
MARISHA: I'm wet.
That was a really cold lake.

1789
01:30:00,426 --> 01:30:03,841
ORION: Prestidigitation!
Now you're all dry.

1790
01:30:03,841 --> 01:30:06,218
LIAM: It's very hard to know, though.
It's dark in there.

1791
01:30:06,218 --> 01:30:09,456
LAURA: Should we just light it up,
see what's in there?

1792
01:30:09,456 --> 01:30:11,645
TALIESIN: Let's light it up.
See what happens.

1793
01:30:11,645 --> 01:30:13,807
LAURA: Hey, Tiberius?

1794
01:30:13,807 --> 01:30:15,215
ORION: Yes? Oh, Light!

1795
01:30:15,215 --> 01:30:17,576
LAURA: I shoot the arrow.

1796
01:30:17,576 --> 01:30:21,509
MATT: Okay. So as you cast Light
on the arrow, it's blinding.

1797
01:30:21,509 --> 01:30:23,146
You know at this point
to close that one eye

1798
01:30:23,146 --> 01:30:24,506
as you release it in the distance.

1799
01:30:24,506 --> 01:30:25,527
LAURA: Oh wait, wrong eye.

1800
01:30:25,527 --> 01:30:27,114
MATT: There you go. That's the one.

1801
01:30:27,114 --> 01:30:28,640
LAURA: Right, right.

1802
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:32,723
MATT: You fire the arrow
into the depth of this cavern.

1803
01:30:32,723 --> 01:30:36,366
Before the Light spell wears off,
it arcs inward

1804
01:30:36,366 --> 01:30:38,600
and it hits the back wall
and ricochets off.

1805
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:42,941
Looking inside, it all
looks like a natural cavern interior.

1806
01:30:42,941 --> 01:30:48,368
The light is the same glowing white light
that you're used to.

1807
01:30:48,368 --> 01:30:49,670
Once it enters the deep part of the cave,

1808
01:30:49,670 --> 01:30:52,375
the light almost gets a purplish hue
before it's snuffed out.

1809
01:30:52,375 --> 01:30:56,307
LAURA: This doesn't seem very good.

1810
01:30:56,307 --> 01:30:59,070
ASHLEY: Wait, the light gets
a purplish hue?

1811
01:30:59,070 --> 01:31:03,769
MATT: The white light becomes purple
and then (ffft) is snuffed.

1812
01:31:03,769 --> 01:31:10,643
ORION: I want to do an arcana check. 18. 
Check for any nasty magic.

1813
01:31:10,643 --> 01:31:13,393
MATT: At this distance,
it's hard to make out any sort of source.

1814
01:31:13,393 --> 01:31:15,568
You don't sense anything directly,
at your distance.

1815
01:31:15,568 --> 01:31:17,610
You'd probably have to get deeper
in the cave

1816
01:31:17,610 --> 01:31:20,717
to make a true assessment
of the magical source.

1817
01:31:20,717 --> 01:31:24,350
LAURA: Oh, you didn't add ten
to your stealth. Pass Without a Trace.

1818
01:31:24,350 --> 01:31:26,486
MATT: You have
Pass Without a Trace now, too?

1819
01:31:26,486 --> 01:31:28,378
LAURA: Well, I already-- yeah.

1820
01:31:28,378 --> 01:31:29,978
LIAM: So my stealth was at a 41.

1821
01:31:29,978 --> 01:31:33,809
MATT: Okay. Good to know. (laughs)

1822
01:31:33,809 --> 01:31:36,655
SAM: What do we do? 
We've got to get-- someone's going in.

1823
01:31:36,655 --> 01:31:38,035
TRAVIS: Want me to go in?

1824
01:31:38,035 --> 01:31:40,247
SAM: Yeah, man! Go in!
OTHERS: No!

1825
01:31:40,247 --> 01:31:43,355
LIAM: No, if anyone's going in, send me.
I'm at a 41 stealth,

1826
01:31:43,355 --> 01:31:46,396
and if we stay on the beach,
we're in view of the main island.

1827
01:31:46,396 --> 01:31:48,237
LAURA: We've got to try to hide
a little bit.

1828
01:31:48,237 --> 01:31:50,529
ASHLEY: So the arrow's not still lit?
It just went through?

1829
01:31:50,529 --> 01:31:52,113
Can you Light, Tiberius?

1830
01:31:52,113 --> 01:31:54,944
LAURA: Just get some light in there. 
Can you put Daylight in there?

1831
01:31:54,944 --> 01:31:58,090
LIAM: Tiberius, my dagger.
Do the dagger.

1832
01:31:58,090 --> 01:32:01,310
ORION: Well, sure, but it means 
that thing will be bright the whole time.

1833
01:32:01,310 --> 01:32:02,940
LIAM: I would lose stealth.

1834
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:04,110
ORION: Yes, you would.

1835
01:32:04,110 --> 01:32:06,204
MARISHA: Pike, can you check--

1836
01:32:06,204 --> 01:32:07,641
ASHLEY: I have darkvision.

1837
01:32:07,641 --> 01:32:10,170
MATT: Yes, as do a lot of you guys.

1838
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:11,108
ASHLEY: Oh, we all do.

1839
01:32:11,108 --> 01:32:12,524
LAURA: Can you see if it's evil?

1840
01:32:12,524 --> 01:32:18,875
SAM: Light a fire. Let's just light a fire
and throw it in there.

1841
01:32:18,875 --> 01:32:21,316
LIAM: Non-magical.
TRAVIS: We have torches.

1842
01:32:21,316 --> 01:32:22,676
LIAM: Yeah, throw a torch in.

1843
01:32:22,676 --> 01:32:24,529
SAM: Yeah, let's just toss a torch.

1844
01:32:24,529 --> 01:32:28,262
TRAVIS: I pull one
of the three torches we have

1845
01:32:28,262 --> 01:32:30,240
and, "Tiberius, will you?"

1846
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:31,585
ORION: (fire breath noise)

1847
01:32:31,585 --> 01:32:33,329
TRAVIS: I give it a nice long throw.

1848
01:32:33,329 --> 01:32:36,607
MATT: All right. Tiberius's flame breath
(fsssh) coalesces

1849
01:32:36,607 --> 01:32:41,502
and begins to ignite the tip of the torch
as Grog lobs it in, end over end.

1850
01:32:41,502 --> 01:32:43,776
You see it hits the far end
of the cavern,

1851
01:32:43,776 --> 01:32:44,984
topples, and hits the ground.

1852
01:32:44,984 --> 01:32:47,752
The fire itself, the bright red burning,
as it comes to rest,

1853
01:32:47,752 --> 01:32:51,311
takes on once again
a strange purplish hue.

1854
01:32:51,311 --> 01:32:53,715
LIAM: Do the half-elves and the gnomes
see anything

1855
01:32:53,715 --> 01:32:55,292
when there's light going through?

1856
01:32:55,292 --> 01:32:59,130
MATT: You see nothing in particular.

1857
01:32:59,130 --> 01:33:02,513
You catch what looks
almost like small whiffs

1858
01:33:02,513 --> 01:33:07,259
of almost a mist or a fog,
but it's like, (ffft) then vanish, (shh).

1859
01:33:07,259 --> 01:33:09,326
LAURA: I don't think 
we should go in there.

1860
01:33:09,326 --> 01:33:12,789
MATT: Almost like
there's this perpetually

1861
01:33:12,789 --> 01:33:17,402
materializing and dematerializing tufts
of small clouds of smoke.

1862
01:33:17,402 --> 01:33:20,912
LIAM: Forget this. Forget this cave.
Keyleth, can you do that thing you do

1863
01:33:20,912 --> 01:33:24,381
where you make the beach
look like an empty beach,

1864
01:33:24,381 --> 01:33:26,721
or something other than it is?

1865
01:33:26,721 --> 01:33:29,423
Can we camp on the beach
instead of going in there?

1866
01:33:29,423 --> 01:33:31,087
MARISHA: I can.

1867
01:33:31,087 --> 01:33:35,267
ORION: Let's do that.
I agree. I'm tired.

1868
01:33:35,267 --> 01:33:41,352
MARISHA: What if this is a clue
or something important?

1869
01:33:41,352 --> 01:33:45,087
SAM: Yeah, we've never shied away 
from a confrontation before.

1870
01:33:45,087 --> 01:33:47,757
ORION: Pike, can you sense
if there's any nasties down there?

1871
01:33:47,757 --> 01:33:51,426
ASHLEY: Can I use Dispel Magic?

1872
01:33:51,426 --> 01:33:52,977
MATT: You can attempt to, yeah.

1873
01:33:52,977 --> 01:33:54,368
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll attempt.

1874
01:33:54,368 --> 01:33:56,801
MATT: Okay. So Pike, as you step up
to the mouth of the cave,

1875
01:33:56,801 --> 01:33:59,876
looking where the torchlight is,
you cast Dispel Magic.

1876
01:33:59,876 --> 01:34:03,629
As you formulate your divine energy,

1877
01:34:03,629 --> 01:34:06,670
grasping onto your symbol of Sarenrae
around your neck,

1878
01:34:06,670 --> 01:34:11,857
you can see this strange pulsing shimmer
of divine energy that clears out the area.

1879
01:34:11,857 --> 01:34:16,215
The purplish hue to the light vanishes

1880
01:34:16,215 --> 01:34:18,612
and the light becomes 
a natural torchlight for a moment

1881
01:34:18,612 --> 01:34:21,414
and all the wisps of smoke vanish...

1882
01:34:21,414 --> 01:34:23,963
then slowly filter back into the space.

1883
01:34:23,963 --> 01:34:27,620
TRAVIS: We don't need to go in there.

1884
01:34:29,798 --> 01:34:33,642
SAM: Indeed. If only we had someone
who could go under the ground

1885
01:34:33,642 --> 01:34:37,446
and be one with the earth
and pop up in there and look around-- no?

1886
01:34:37,446 --> 01:34:39,840
LAURA: But she'll be popping up
into the wisps.

1887
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,518
SAM: Yeah, but she'll be fine!

1888
01:34:43,208 --> 01:34:44,948
TRAVIS: Wall it up!

1889
01:34:44,948 --> 01:34:48,387
LAURA: I think just wall it up.
Can we see anything sparkling?

1890
01:34:48,387 --> 01:34:50,818
Can we look in and see
if there's anything that looks useful?

1891
01:34:50,818 --> 01:34:52,694
TRAVIS: Yeah, do I see any shapes
and colors and sparkly things?

1892
01:34:52,694 --> 01:34:55,014
ASHLEY: Should we check for traps?

1893
01:34:55,014 --> 01:34:57,195
MATT: It's hard to tell. You can't see 
the entire cavern from this distance,

1894
01:34:57,195 --> 01:34:59,452
because the cavern opens up
and then curves around.

1895
01:34:59,452 --> 01:35:02,182
There's a whole portion
you can't see without entering it.

1896
01:35:02,182 --> 01:35:04,319
LIAM: Here's what I think, all right?

1897
01:35:04,319 --> 01:35:06,870
We don't need to whack
every problem over the head,

1898
01:35:06,870 --> 01:35:10,782
and we have something far more important
than whatever's in there.

1899
01:35:10,782 --> 01:35:12,137
LAURA: Right, Lady Kima?

1900
01:35:12,137 --> 01:35:16,631
ORION: Right. I suggest we go and rest.
I believe we can get some respite.

1901
01:35:16,631 --> 01:35:19,778
MATT: "I think we have a specific goal
at this point in time,

1902
01:35:19,778 --> 01:35:21,958
"and who knows what dangers
or terrors roam these tunnels

1903
01:35:21,958 --> 01:35:25,552
"aside from our specific
directional choice at this moment."

1904
01:35:25,552 --> 01:35:28,839
LIAM: The only question is,
do we want to try to rest here

1905
01:35:28,839 --> 01:35:30,536
under some sort of illusion,

1906
01:35:30,536 --> 01:35:32,866
or do we go to the island we can see?

1907
01:35:32,866 --> 01:35:35,706
LAURA: No, because the island's
way over back here.

1908
01:35:35,706 --> 01:35:39,064
TALIESIN: We rest here. We take shifts.
We should be fine.

1909
01:35:39,064 --> 01:35:45,265
LIAM: We could sail there
to the northwestern edge of the island.

1910
01:35:45,265 --> 01:35:47,050
There's some sort of structure there.

1911
01:35:47,050 --> 01:35:49,275
LAURA: I think we rest up
before we do that.

1912
01:35:49,275 --> 01:35:52,161
MARISHA: What if there's something
in this cavern that could help us, though?

1913
01:35:52,161 --> 01:35:53,502
LAURA: Can you wall it up?

1914
01:35:53,502 --> 01:35:55,370
TRAVIS: Between you and Tiberius,
with the columns and stuff?

1915
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:58,012
MARISHA: We could.
How about this?

1916
01:35:58,012 --> 01:36:00,151
TRAVIS: I don't need to rest,
so I can just stand guard.

1917
01:36:00,151 --> 01:36:02,139
MARISHA: How about I do what Scanlan says?

1918
01:36:02,139 --> 01:36:04,796
SAM: Oh. Hello.

1919
01:36:04,796 --> 01:36:06,236
TALIESIN: That always works.

1920
01:36:06,236 --> 01:36:09,623
MARISHA: Yes, I know. I think this is
the first time I've said this, ever.

1921
01:36:09,623 --> 01:36:15,448
Maybe I'll try what Scanlan says
and I'll turn into a rock elemental

1922
01:36:15,448 --> 01:36:18,677
and just bamf in there
and see if there's anything good,

1923
01:36:18,677 --> 01:36:21,631
and if it's bad, I'll just run out
and make a rock wall.

1924
01:36:21,631 --> 01:36:23,158
SAM: Oh. Okay.

1925
01:36:23,158 --> 01:36:25,676
LAURA: All right. We'll all be ready
to attack on the outside.

1926
01:36:25,676 --> 01:36:27,383
MARISHA: Maybe? Okay?
TRAVIS: Go for it.

1927
01:36:27,383 --> 01:36:29,050
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's go for it.
This is a terrible plan.

1928
01:36:29,050 --> 01:36:30,522
I think it's a great idea.

1929
01:36:30,522 --> 01:36:32,542
MARISHA: Let's do it. I like it.
SAM: Yeah, let's send in one person.

1930
01:36:32,542 --> 01:36:36,750
ORION: As soon as I see 
Her Royalty go in--

1931
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:39,719
MATT: All right. You all gather yourself
on the exterior of the cave.

1932
01:36:39,719 --> 01:36:42,024
You get into defensive positions
and prepare--

1933
01:36:42,024 --> 01:36:43,719
LIAM: Can I ask one quick question
before we go?

1934
01:36:43,719 --> 01:36:45,688
Regardless of what happens,

1935
01:36:45,688 --> 01:36:47,465
if there is
something shitty in here or not,

1936
01:36:47,465 --> 01:36:48,987
are we camping here afterward?

1937
01:36:48,987 --> 01:36:50,112
OTHERS: Yes.

1938
01:36:50,112 --> 01:36:52,958
LIAM: We're sure? Okay.
Then I click my Boots of Haste.

1939
01:36:52,958 --> 01:36:54,205
MATT: All right.

1940
01:36:54,205 --> 01:36:57,673
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead
and cast Enhance Ability on myself

1941
01:36:57,673 --> 01:37:03,621
before I do that,
and give myself...

1942
01:37:03,621 --> 01:37:06,621
extra wisdom.

1943
01:37:06,621 --> 01:37:07,920
MATT: All right, extra wisdom.

1944
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:11,133
MARISHA: I want to be a perceptive bastard
while I'm in there.

1945
01:37:11,133 --> 01:37:14,175
MATT: So Keyleth transforms herself
into her earth elemental form.

1946
01:37:14,175 --> 01:37:15,790
TALIESIN: Rah. That's what rocks say.

1947
01:37:15,790 --> 01:37:17,195
TALIESIN AND MARISHA: Rah.

1948
01:37:17,195 --> 01:37:23,583
SAM: I'm going to inspire her
with a little dolphin dance or something.

1949
01:37:23,583 --> 01:37:28,577
Whatever that is. I don't know,
I'm just going to--

1950
01:37:28,577 --> 01:37:30,757
MATT: It's hard to explain why,

1951
01:37:30,757 --> 01:37:33,887
but his strange shimmy
is slightly inspiring.

1952
01:37:33,887 --> 01:37:36,398
You've learned something
about yourself today

1953
01:37:36,398 --> 01:37:39,934
that you hope nobody else
wants to bring up in conversation.

1954
01:37:39,934 --> 01:37:42,086
You get a d10 inspiration dice.

1955
01:37:42,093 --> 01:37:47,480
ORION: As soon as I see Keyleth go off,
I rub my ring and go invisible.

1956
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:52,166
MATT: Okay. So as you guys
all mount into your defensive positions,

1957
01:37:52,166 --> 01:37:57,103
Keyleth, are you going straight through?
Are you going beneath, above?

1958
01:37:57,103 --> 01:38:01,792
MARISHA: Burrow beneath. 
I'll go, "(deep voice) Bye-bye."

1959
01:38:01,792 --> 01:38:06,346
MATT: This large earth elemental form
takes a few lumbering steps forward,

1960
01:38:06,346 --> 01:38:08,976
and begins to sink
into the sand and gravel below,

1961
01:38:08,976 --> 01:38:10,450
just (shifting sound).

1962
01:38:10,450 --> 01:38:12,712
MARISHA: "Oh yeah, wait,
have you guys seen this one?"

1963
01:38:12,712 --> 01:38:17,239
(all laugh)

1964
01:38:17,239 --> 01:38:18,880
MARISHA: As I go into the ground.

1965
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:22,522
MATT: The most awkward
earth elemental exit ever.

1966
01:38:22,529 --> 01:38:25,556
MARISHA: "I'll take the elevator."

1967
01:38:25,556 --> 01:38:27,836
TRAVIS: I think it's the funniest thing
I've ever seen.

1968
01:38:27,836 --> 01:38:30,848
(all laugh)

1969
01:38:30,848 --> 01:38:34,358
MATT: Grog's loud laughter bellows,
echoing through the cavern.

1970
01:38:34,358 --> 01:38:37,189
You make your way underneath the ground,

1971
01:38:37,189 --> 01:38:40,729
using your tremor sense to formulate
where the top of this cavern would be,

1972
01:38:40,729 --> 01:38:43,872
and you poke your head through the floor.

1973
01:38:43,872 --> 01:38:46,948
Looking into this, you can see now,
there are portions of this cavern

1974
01:38:46,948 --> 01:38:49,535
where it looks like elements
of the mithril veins

1975
01:38:49,535 --> 01:38:55,425
that the subterranean Kraghammer mines
were currently pulling from

1976
01:38:55,425 --> 01:38:57,591
seem to now spread down into this cavern.

1977
01:38:57,591 --> 01:39:00,422
There are small veins
that trickle through the rock

1978
01:39:00,422 --> 01:39:01,752
in this cavern of mithril.

1979
01:39:01,752 --> 01:39:06,350
You also look up and...
make a perception check.

1980
01:39:06,350 --> 01:39:10,006
MARISHA: With advantage, right?
MATT: This is wisdom, yep.

1981
01:39:11,696 --> 01:39:16,643
MARISHA: That's a 13. That's a 19!
I'll take that one.

1982
01:39:16,643 --> 01:39:18,758
MATT: All right, total of?

1983
01:39:18,758 --> 01:39:20,734
MARISHA: 29.

1984
01:39:20,734 --> 01:39:23,590
MATT: 29. You take a moment
and formulate your vision,

1985
01:39:23,590 --> 01:39:27,121
the firelight still trickling through,
although you have darkvision.

1986
01:39:27,121 --> 01:39:31,610
You look about the room, and you can see

1987
01:39:31,610 --> 01:39:34,610
there is a strange energy about the room.

1988
01:39:34,610 --> 01:39:36,691
There's something about this room

1989
01:39:36,691 --> 01:39:40,538
that feels similar
to when you encountered the Frost Plane

1990
01:39:40,538 --> 01:39:45,275
during the first Westruun
winter's veil encounter.

1991
01:39:45,275 --> 01:39:50,201
There's a type of energy
that seems to be brought into being

1992
01:39:50,201 --> 01:39:53,826
whenever you've caught a mind flayer
shifting and bamfing

1993
01:39:53,826 --> 01:39:55,958
out of any sort of combat you come into.

1994
01:39:55,958 --> 01:39:58,395
There's something about this room
that seems like it's crossing over

1995
01:39:58,395 --> 01:40:00,318
or has a thin barrier 
with some other plane.

1996
01:40:00,318 --> 01:40:02,469
LIAM: It's a gate.

1997
01:40:02,469 --> 01:40:04,874
MATT: You don't see a particular doorway,

1998
01:40:04,874 --> 01:40:07,524
but it feels like
there is a very thin veil here,

1999
01:40:07,524 --> 01:40:09,256
and as you focus more on the vicinity,

2000
01:40:09,256 --> 01:40:12,674
you can see what looks like
little bits of energy that leak through.

2001
01:40:12,674 --> 01:40:16,205
That mist you were seeing
seems to be elements

2002
01:40:16,205 --> 01:40:20,708
where the actual reality of this room
is warping temporarily, and shifting.

2003
01:40:20,708 --> 01:40:22,134
ASHLEY: It's like Stargate.

2004
01:40:22,134 --> 01:40:27,893
MARISHA: Can I take a piece of rock

2005
01:40:27,893 --> 01:40:30,893
and toss it up?

2006
01:40:30,893 --> 01:40:35,207
MATT: You take it and you throw it up.
It arcs across,

2007
01:40:35,207 --> 01:40:37,747
hits the other side of the room,
and clatters to the ground.

2008
01:40:37,747 --> 01:40:42,635
As it clatters to the ground,
you suddenly see, lightning-quick,

2009
01:40:42,635 --> 01:40:46,707
five of these large,

2010
01:40:46,707 --> 01:40:50,367
fast-moving,
slithering weird creatures

2011
01:40:50,367 --> 01:40:54,292
that were up against the wall
and now visible at this point

2012
01:40:54,292 --> 01:40:56,612
strike at the rock
and seem to start fighting each other

2013
01:40:56,612 --> 01:40:58,654
for whatever that movement was.

2014
01:40:58,654 --> 01:41:01,479
They're large, bluish and purple in color
when it shifts in its form,

2015
01:41:01,479 --> 01:41:03,157
with these sharp beaks

2016
01:41:03,157 --> 01:41:06,197
and what looks like four tentacles
that wrap out from the face.

2017
01:41:06,197 --> 01:41:09,479
LIAM: That's familiar.
SAM: Maybe they're friendly!

2018
01:41:09,479 --> 01:41:13,890
MATT: Make a nature check, if you want.
No, this would be arcana.

2019
01:41:13,890 --> 01:41:16,878
Arcana. This wouldn't be nature.

2020
01:41:16,878 --> 01:41:20,754
MARISHA: Arcana? All right.

2021
01:41:20,754 --> 01:41:22,421
TALIESIN: You've got a number there.

2022
01:41:22,421 --> 01:41:28,213
MARISHA: I've got a vague number. 11.
MATT: Okay.

2023
01:41:28,213 --> 01:41:31,728
MARISHA: Wait! Plus four. 15.

2024
01:41:31,728 --> 01:41:36,256
MATT: Arcana is intellect, though.
It's not wisdom, is it?

2025
01:41:36,256 --> 01:41:37,754
MARISHA: I used Scanlan's die.

2026
01:41:37,754 --> 01:41:42,428
MATT: Oh, you did? Oh, I see. 15.
Unable to really make out

2027
01:41:42,428 --> 01:41:43,825
more than you've heard
of creatures like this.

2028
01:41:43,825 --> 01:41:47,708
Unlike most aberrations and creatures

2029
01:41:47,708 --> 01:41:50,116
that seem to bleed over
from different planes of existence,

2030
01:41:50,116 --> 01:41:54,089
this one is not an aberration
in its form.

2031
01:41:54,089 --> 01:41:58,165
This is just a subterranean monstrosity.
It's known as a grick.

2032
01:41:58,165 --> 01:42:00,058
MARISHA: A grick.

2033
01:42:00,058 --> 01:42:04,738
MATT: Essentially, it looks like that.

2034
01:42:04,738 --> 01:42:06,896
ALL: Ew!

2035
01:42:06,896 --> 01:42:08,702
SAM: Show the people at home.

2036
01:42:08,702 --> 01:42:10,247
TRAVIS: I automatically don't like it.

2037
01:42:10,247 --> 01:42:13,153
MATT: As they all take a moment
and realize

2038
01:42:13,153 --> 01:42:15,284
that whatever they were fighting over
is not living and not moving,

2039
01:42:15,284 --> 01:42:20,124
they hiss at each other
and slowly find other alcoves

2040
01:42:20,124 --> 01:42:23,935
and what you can now see are small caves
that are dug into the rock nearby.

2041
01:42:23,935 --> 01:42:26,526
Something draws them to this room,

2042
01:42:26,526 --> 01:42:31,398
as any natural space with this strange,
fluctuating energy would do so.

2043
01:42:31,398 --> 01:42:35,302
MARISHA: But they're not necessarily
bleeding through from the other plane.

2044
01:42:35,302 --> 01:42:36,680
They come from this plane.

2045
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:40,303
MATT: It seems to be, yeah.
They're not too weird.

2046
01:42:40,303 --> 01:42:45,514
They're weird,
but they're not too weird.

2047
01:42:45,514 --> 01:42:48,541
MARISHA: Big worms with tentacles,
but not too weird.

2048
01:42:48,541 --> 01:42:49,759
MATT: You've seen it all.

2049
01:42:49,759 --> 01:42:51,381
TALIESIN: They're not wearing sombreros
or anything.

2050
01:42:51,390 --> 01:42:54,468
LAURA: So what are you doing, Keyleth?
Are you staying in there?

2051
01:42:54,468 --> 01:42:56,138
TRAVIS: Please say no.

2052
01:42:56,138 --> 01:42:59,861
MARISHA: I'm just going to seep back down.

2053
01:42:59,861 --> 01:43:01,304
LIAM: Take the stairs, though.

2054
01:43:01,304 --> 01:43:05,001
MARISHA: I take the stairs.

2055
01:43:05,001 --> 01:43:08,867
MATT: All right. After a few moments,
Keyleth reappears.

2056
01:43:08,867 --> 01:43:13,208
MARISHA: But before I reappear, I go,
"Grog. I'm in a boat."

2057
01:43:13,208 --> 01:43:15,250
(all laugh)

2058
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:22,128
TRAVIS: She's in the floor!
And she's in a boat! It's magic. (giggles)

2059
01:43:22,128 --> 01:43:25,253
LIAM: It is pretty funny.

2060
01:43:25,253 --> 01:43:28,688
TRAVIS: Will you teach me that sometime?

2061
01:43:28,688 --> 01:43:29,888
MARISHA: "No."

2062
01:43:29,888 --> 01:43:31,804
MATT: For a split-second,
as you're doing that,

2063
01:43:31,804 --> 01:43:36,213
you realize
that laughter's probably very audible.

2064
01:43:38,548 --> 01:43:41,839
MARISHA: I'm not an elemental anymore.

2065
01:43:41,839 --> 01:43:46,456
MATT: So as you start laughing,
you revert back from elemental form.

2066
01:43:46,456 --> 01:43:49,052
MARISHA: I go, "Tee-hee-hee, shh."

2067
01:43:49,052 --> 01:43:50,230
ASHLEY: Make a wall!

2068
01:43:50,230 --> 01:43:52,452
LAURA: Wait, what did you see, Keyleth?

2069
01:43:52,452 --> 01:43:54,452
SAM: Wait, is she back?

2070
01:43:54,466 --> 01:43:56,711
MATT: Yeah, her elemental form is gone.
She's now back into Keyleth's form.

2071
01:43:56,711 --> 01:43:58,347
LIAM: We're all just on the beach.

2072
01:43:58,347 --> 01:43:59,591
ORION: I'm not.

2073
01:43:59,591 --> 01:44:04,575
SAM: Thanks, Ti.
LIAM: People were still laughing.

2074
01:44:04,575 --> 01:44:08,729
ASHLEY: I'm laughing just a little bit.
I maybe peed a little.

2075
01:44:08,729 --> 01:44:11,921
ORION: Pike is chuckling, at best.
TRAVIS: I stop laughing.

2076
01:44:11,921 --> 01:44:13,821
LAURA: What was it?
Was there anything in there?

2077
01:44:13,821 --> 01:44:19,835
MARISHA: It seemed like it had
Dimension Door properties,

2078
01:44:19,835 --> 01:44:23,645
but I don't know if it was necessarily
at full Dimension Door strength.

2079
01:44:23,645 --> 01:44:24,928
LAURA: Were there creatures?

2080
01:44:24,928 --> 01:44:26,791
MARISHA: There were creatures.

2081
01:44:26,791 --> 01:44:30,164
There appeared to be these things
that I've heard of, called gricks.

2082
01:44:30,164 --> 01:44:33,940
They're like worms 
with beaks and tentacles.

2083
01:44:33,940 --> 01:44:36,017
LAURA: Oh, I've heard of gricks.
They're really fast.

2084
01:44:36,017 --> 01:44:39,293
MARISHA: Yeah, they're super-fast.
LAURA: Yeah, they slither.

2085
01:44:39,293 --> 01:44:41,723
LAURA: Yeah, man. I studied the Underdark.
LIAM: All right.

2086
01:44:41,723 --> 01:44:45,400
MARISHA: They did this whole
Hungry Hungry Hippos thing.

2087
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:48,431
SAM: But you said it was a gate
to another dimension?

2088
01:44:48,431 --> 01:44:51,966
MARISHA: It seemed to be
some sort of dimensional gateway.

2089
01:44:51,966 --> 01:44:54,126
I don't know which dimension.

2090
01:44:54,126 --> 01:44:58,710
SAM: I we come across any people
that we can beat information out of,

2091
01:44:58,710 --> 01:45:01,792
we might want to ask them
if this a known thing,

2092
01:45:01,792 --> 01:45:05,067
a gateway back to the overworld.

2093
01:45:05,067 --> 01:45:08,058
LAURA: I think it would probably go
to the Abyss or something.

2094
01:45:08,058 --> 01:45:11,510
LIAM: Or a shortcut into the--
MARISHA: Into the temple.

2095
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:17,525
LAURA: I wonder, do they attack things?
They seemed really fast, right?

2096
01:45:17,525 --> 01:45:19,436
MARISHA: The grick things? Yeah.

2097
01:45:19,436 --> 01:45:22,019
LAURA: Percy can you make a bomb?

2098
01:45:22,019 --> 01:45:27,361
SAM: Oh, he did already. I've got it.
I have a bomb.

2099
01:45:27,361 --> 01:45:29,749
LAURA: Can you throw the bomb in there
and they would all maybe attack it,

2100
01:45:29,749 --> 01:45:31,926
and maybe it would blow them up?

2101
01:45:31,926 --> 01:45:34,494
SAM: Maybe. It might hit some of them.

2102
01:45:34,494 --> 01:45:38,937
Do we want to go in there?
Because we can certainly do that.

2103
01:45:38,937 --> 01:45:42,146
LAURA: Just throw it from outside
and see what happens.

2104
01:45:42,147 --> 01:45:45,041
MARISHA: If we take a few minutes
and I take another breather--

2105
01:45:45,041 --> 01:45:48,005
because being a rock elemental
takes it out of you for a little bit--

2106
01:45:48,005 --> 01:45:50,886
and you guys can make some bombs,
I can go back in there as an elemental.

2107
01:45:50,886 --> 01:45:54,508
ORION: Actually, I think
that's a good idea. Percy?

2108
01:45:54,508 --> 01:46:00,779
The bomb that Scanlan is holding,
could you fix a thing around it

2109
01:46:00,779 --> 01:46:03,648
to possibly hold magic properties?

2110
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:06,413
TALIESIN: I have not the slightest clue
how to do that.

2111
01:46:06,413 --> 01:46:12,210
ORION: You can use some of this--
one of the glass, my potion--

2112
01:46:12,210 --> 01:46:13,687
what do you call those fucking things?

2113
01:46:13,687 --> 01:46:15,134
TRAVIS: Vials?
ORION: Yes.

2114
01:46:15,134 --> 01:46:17,981
SAM: Are we right outside
the mouth of the cave right now?

2115
01:46:17,981 --> 01:46:19,595
LAURA: We are really close to it.

2116
01:46:19,595 --> 01:46:21,961
SAM: Can we get away
from the mouth of the cave?

2117
01:46:21,961 --> 01:46:26,018
TRAVIS: Okay, who needs to rest?
Show of hands, who needs rest?

2118
01:46:26,018 --> 01:46:27,571
MARISHA: I'm going to rest
while they talk.

2119
01:46:27,571 --> 01:46:29,331
While they figure out a plan.

2120
01:46:29,331 --> 01:46:32,026
LIAM: Tibber-hoods,
do you have any fireballs left in you?

2121
01:46:32,026 --> 01:46:35,128
SAM: T-Money, what do you think?

2122
01:46:35,128 --> 01:46:37,966
ORION: I cast Silence on Vax.

2123
01:46:37,966 --> 01:46:39,592
(all laugh)

2124
01:46:39,592 --> 01:46:41,018
SAM: I cast Dispel Magic.

2125
01:46:41,018 --> 01:46:43,465
ORION: Counterspell!

2126
01:46:43,465 --> 01:46:45,775
SAM: Counter-counterspell!

2127
01:46:45,775 --> 01:46:48,191
ORION: Do you have Counterspell?
You don't have Counterspell.

2128
01:46:48,191 --> 01:46:49,466
SAM: No.

2129
01:46:49,466 --> 01:46:51,345
(all laugh)

2130
01:46:51,345 --> 01:46:55,421
MATT: All right, both you guys go ahead--
well no, roll your Counterspell roll.

2131
01:46:55,421 --> 01:46:57,098
ORION: Counterspell 
just fizzles his shit.

2132
01:46:57,098 --> 01:46:58,468
MATT: What level is your spell?

2133
01:46:58,468 --> 01:47:00,519
SAM: It's a level 3 spell?

2134
01:47:00,519 --> 01:47:02,642
MATT: So, no, your spell just (pfft).

2135
01:47:02,642 --> 01:47:04,130
SAM: Damn it.

2136
01:47:04,130 --> 01:47:08,737
ORION: And I don't silence him.
Did I have to roll anything to do that?

2137
01:47:08,737 --> 01:47:10,310
MATT: No.
ORION: Oh, cool.

2138
01:47:10,310 --> 01:47:11,487
MATT: He has to make a save for Silence.

2139
01:47:11,487 --> 01:47:13,316
LIAM: Am I silenced?

2140
01:47:13,316 --> 01:47:16,899
MATT: What's the save on that one?
ORION: 17.

2141
01:47:16,899 --> 01:47:19,548
MATT: Right, but what's the actual save?
Is it wisdom, is it intelligence?

2142
01:47:19,548 --> 01:47:23,134
LIAM: Well, I rolled pitifully,
so it probably doesn't matter.

2143
01:47:23,134 --> 01:47:29,925
ORION: I just know it's 120-foot range.
Should write the other stuff down.

2144
01:47:29,925 --> 01:47:33,163
LAURA: Tiberius, 
was that really necessary?

2145
01:47:33,163 --> 01:47:36,348
ORION: "No, it wasn't.
But yes, I do have fireballs left."

2146
01:47:36,354 --> 01:47:38,799
And I dispel it immediately.

2147
01:47:38,799 --> 01:47:40,551
LIAM: (yells incoherently)

2148
01:47:40,551 --> 01:47:41,851
LAURA: Shh!

2149
01:47:41,851 --> 01:47:44,777
LIAM: I didn't know 
he was going to dispel it!

2150
01:47:44,777 --> 01:47:47,603
ORION: I'm unpredictable.

2151
01:47:47,603 --> 01:47:50,442
ASHLEY: Because I have Spiritual Weapon,

2152
01:47:50,442 --> 01:47:55,615
maybe I can try to create
a crazy-ass bomb type of thing.

2153
01:47:55,615 --> 01:47:57,379
SAM: We have a bomb.

2154
01:47:57,379 --> 01:47:59,617
MATT: You do know
that the essence of Spiritual Weapon,

2155
01:47:59,617 --> 01:48:05,018
it creates a weapon
that is partially in form

2156
01:48:05,018 --> 01:48:09,576
with your deity's
weapon of choice or preference.

2157
01:48:09,576 --> 01:48:12,115
It's mainly melee weapons.
Nothing too intricate.

2158
01:48:12,115 --> 01:48:14,176
TALIESIN: We are not making
a holy hand grenade.

2159
01:48:14,176 --> 01:48:15,563
LAURA: We already have a bomb.

2160
01:48:15,563 --> 01:48:17,997
Just throw it in, they attack it,
we close them up.

2161
01:48:17,997 --> 01:48:19,757
SAM: I have a bomb.
TRAVIS: We've got a bomb.

2162
01:48:19,757 --> 01:48:21,889
ORION: With what Vex is getting to, Percy,

2163
01:48:21,889 --> 01:48:26,079
is if you could fashion such a thing,
or if I could, I'll enchant it.

2164
01:48:26,079 --> 01:48:27,696
LAURA: Throw a bomb, they attack it,

2165
01:48:27,696 --> 01:48:30,381
then you can throw a fireball
at the same time.

2166
01:48:30,381 --> 01:48:33,150
We just have to get them in a cluster.

2167
01:48:33,150 --> 01:48:36,416
ORION: Can I attempt to imbue the bomb
with a fireball in it?

2168
01:48:36,416 --> 01:48:38,134
MATT: No, 
that is a Delayed-Blast Fireball,

2169
01:48:38,134 --> 01:48:39,281
which is a higher-level spell.

2170
01:48:39,281 --> 01:48:40,261
ORION: Okay.

2171
01:48:40,261 --> 01:48:41,547
ASHLEY: Throw the bomb in.

2172
01:48:41,547 --> 01:48:44,470
LAURA AND LIAM: One-two punch.
TRAVIS: Scanlan, toss it.

2173
01:48:44,470 --> 01:48:48,131
SAM: I'm not a good thrower.
Is that what you call it, thrower?

2174
01:48:48,131 --> 01:48:51,941
MARISHA: Here, give it to me
and I'll go in as an elemental.

2175
01:48:51,941 --> 01:48:54,707
LIAM: No, we can just throw it.
LAURA: Just throw it!

2176
01:48:54,707 --> 01:48:57,361
SAM: Then you'll have to hit it
to light it.

2177
01:48:57,361 --> 01:49:01,625
ASHLEY: Who has really good dexterity?

2178
01:49:01,625 --> 01:49:05,350
ORION: You have a bomb?
SAM: I have a bomb.

2179
01:49:05,350 --> 01:49:06,680
ORION: Hold it out in your hand, please.

2180
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:09,278
SAM: I don't want to touch it.
It's a saddlebag bomb.

2181
01:49:09,278 --> 01:49:12,310
LIAM: I'm not trying 
to get it into a basket.

2182
01:49:12,315 --> 01:49:14,877
LAURA: We just need to throw it
into the cave.

2183
01:49:14,877 --> 01:49:16,628
ORION: I cast Telekinesis.

2184
01:49:16,628 --> 01:49:20,026
I pick up the bomb,
and I start guiding it into the cave.

2185
01:49:20,026 --> 01:49:22,600
LAURA: Is it so hard
to just throw a freaking bomb into a cave?

2186
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:24,061
SAM: It's already in!

2187
01:49:24,061 --> 01:49:25,392
ORION: Pay attention, ranger.

2188
01:49:25,392 --> 01:49:27,866
MATT: So the bomb
that was constructed ages ago by Percy

2189
01:49:27,866 --> 01:49:30,688
that was originally intended
to put on a summoned pony.

2190
01:49:30,688 --> 01:49:32,252
SAM: Yes. Never got to use it.

2191
01:49:32,252 --> 01:49:33,977
MATT: But now is finally being used.

2192
01:49:33,977 --> 01:49:35,470
Tiberius, you approach
the edge of the cavern.

2193
01:49:35,470 --> 01:49:37,040
Make a stealth check.

2194
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:40,297
ASHLEY: How do we light it?

2195
01:49:40,297 --> 01:49:45,091
SAM: He'll light it. A what check?
LAURA: A stealth check.

2196
01:49:46,761 --> 01:49:48,672
ORION: I'm still invisible.

2197
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:50,094
MATT: Right, so you
would have advantage on that.

2198
01:49:50,094 --> 01:49:51,326
ORION: Oh. Dope.

2199
01:49:51,326 --> 01:49:52,817
LAURA: And you have
Pass Without a Trace.

2200
01:49:52,817 --> 01:49:54,262
ORION: Yes. What's with that, so.

2201
01:49:54,262 --> 01:49:57,819
MATT: Invisibility and Telekinesis
are both concentration spells.

2202
01:49:57,819 --> 01:49:59,319
You would lose your Invisibility
to cast Telekinesis.

2203
01:49:59,319 --> 01:50:01,635
ORION: All right. Well, I rolled 21.

2204
01:50:01,635 --> 01:50:04,244
MATT: A 21 total?
On the first roll.

2205
01:50:04,244 --> 01:50:06,980
ORION: Yes.
I rolled a 13 the second time.

2206
01:50:06,980 --> 01:50:08,703
MATT: Okay, got you.

2207
01:50:08,703 --> 01:50:10,261
So as you make your way up
to the edge of the cavern,

2208
01:50:10,261 --> 01:50:13,167
you come in partially,
you guide the bomb towards the back,

2209
01:50:13,167 --> 01:50:16,008
and you lob it towards the far end.

2210
01:50:16,008 --> 01:50:20,641
This large, awkward
saddlebag-style construct

2211
01:50:20,641 --> 01:50:23,902
of Percy's design,
made of leather, metal bands,

2212
01:50:23,902 --> 01:50:27,407
hits the back wall--

2213
01:50:27,407 --> 01:50:28,433
TALIESIN: I was very proud of that.

2214
01:50:28,433 --> 01:50:30,223
ORION: As soon as I let go,
I cast Invisibility on myself again.

2215
01:50:30,223 --> 01:50:31,130
MATT: Okay.

2216
01:50:33,450 --> 01:50:36,241
ORION: I'm going to wait. What happens?

2217
01:50:36,241 --> 01:50:37,351
TRAVIS: Yeah, you wait
and see what happens.

2218
01:50:37,351 --> 01:50:37,961
SAM: Let's find out.

2219
01:50:37,961 --> 01:50:40,681
MATT: Okay. The bomb hits the wall,
hits the ground, tumbles for a second,

2220
01:50:40,681 --> 01:50:42,471
awkwardly slumps over on itself.

2221
01:50:42,471 --> 01:50:45,088
At which point, in a blur of motion,
the strange hissing sound,

2222
01:50:45,088 --> 01:50:47,440
a bunch of momentum hits the room

2223
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,654
and you see all these creatures
begin attacking it--

2224
01:50:49,674 --> 01:50:53,857
ORION: As soon as I hear that noise,
Fireball.

2225
01:50:53,857 --> 01:50:55,136
LAURA: What's the point of the bomb?
Why not just do that?

2226
01:50:55,136 --> 01:50:56,231
LIAM: It'll ignite the bomb.
LAURA: You're right, it will, yeah.

2227
01:50:56,231 --> 01:50:58,609
MATT: So. The fireball impacts
the far end of the wall,

2228
01:50:58,609 --> 01:51:00,314
where the cluster
of these strange worm creatures are.

2229
01:51:00,314 --> 01:51:03,701
It explodes with a large, blasting,
echoing explosion sound.

2230
01:51:03,701 --> 01:51:04,907
SAM: I'm doing this.

2231
01:51:04,907 --> 01:51:07,494
MATT: Hold your ears.
Roll damage on that.

2232
01:51:07,494 --> 01:51:11,506
ASHLEY: I take my shield
and put it in front of a couple people.

2233
01:51:13,016 --> 01:51:17,167
TALIESIN: Scanlan, is there any way
you could absorb this sound?

2234
01:51:17,197 --> 01:51:18,219
MARISHA: Yeah, could we cast Silence?

2235
01:51:18,219 --> 01:51:21,799
SAM: Nope. He can't. Too late.
He's casting like seven spells right now.

2236
01:51:21,799 --> 01:51:23,673
MATT: All right. How much damage is that?

2237
01:51:30,433 --> 01:51:34,074
LIAM: Once we finish this math,
this explosion is going to be really cool.

2238
01:51:34,074 --> 01:51:34,992
LAURA: And really loud.

2239
01:51:34,992 --> 01:51:36,340
ORION: 32.

2240
01:51:36,340 --> 01:51:37,674
MATT: 32 points of damage?
ORION: Yeah.

2241
01:51:37,674 --> 01:51:39,105
MATT: That blasts open.

2242
01:51:39,105 --> 01:51:42,495
Percy, roll 4d6 points of damage
from the actual bomb

2243
01:51:42,495 --> 01:51:44,850
as the fireball detonates the saddlebag
simultaneously

2244
01:51:44,850 --> 01:51:47,083
with the explosion of the fireball.

2245
01:51:50,163 --> 01:51:51,628
TALIESIN: 14 points of damage. 4d6.

2246
01:51:51,628 --> 01:51:52,813
MATT: Okay, all right, great.

2247
01:51:52,813 --> 01:51:56,269
So simultaneously you guys hear
(explosion noises).

2248
01:51:56,269 --> 01:51:59,795
You can feel the sand shift and move
and some part of the beach,

2249
01:51:59,795 --> 01:52:02,303
some of the gravel
moves and rocks a little bit.

2250
01:52:02,303 --> 01:52:03,351
TALIESIN: Oh, god.

2251
01:52:03,351 --> 01:52:08,634
MATT: Pitch-black smoke
comes pouring out of the cavern.

2252
01:52:08,634 --> 01:52:09,864
You have to guard yourself.

2253
01:52:09,894 --> 01:52:11,123
LIAM: That's going to attract 
some attention.

2254
01:52:11,123 --> 01:52:14,587
MATT: As the smoke slowly clears,
you get a glance in there

2255
01:52:14,587 --> 01:52:20,559
and you can see there are bits
and pieces and chunks of grick matter

2256
01:52:20,559 --> 01:52:23,623
across the wall
and the inside of the cavern,

2257
01:52:23,623 --> 01:52:26,347
with some gaping half-bodies
of these creatures

2258
01:52:26,347 --> 01:52:28,089
torn open from the explosion.

2259
01:52:28,089 --> 01:52:30,774
There is nothing living
and nothing moving

2260
01:52:30,774 --> 01:52:32,591
from what you can see
at the center of this cavern.

2261
01:52:32,591 --> 01:52:34,291
SAM: Let's go in!

2262
01:52:34,301 --> 01:52:37,314
MATT: The occasional (dripping sounds)
chunks dripping off the ceiling.

2263
01:52:37,314 --> 01:52:39,116
TRAVIS: Excellent.
ASHLEY: Is the magic dispelled? For sure?

2264
01:52:39,116 --> 01:52:40,317
LAURA: Take a couple steps in,
and perception.

2265
01:52:40,317 --> 01:52:44,713
MATT: Perception check.
LIAM: 15.

2266
01:52:44,713 --> 01:52:47,181
SAM: It was a good bomb.
TALIESIN: It was a very good bomb.

2267
01:52:47,181 --> 01:52:49,752
SAM: Thank you for crafting it for me.
What do I owe you?

2268
01:52:49,752 --> 01:52:53,942
TALIESIN: Your life, at this point.
And a song. You owe me a song.

2269
01:52:53,942 --> 01:52:55,268
SAM: Maybe start on a new one.

2270
01:52:55,268 --> 01:52:55,962
LAURA: 24.

2271
01:52:55,962 --> 01:52:57,295
MATT: Okay, glancing through?
You can see the small tunnels

2272
01:52:57,295 --> 01:52:59,140
that these creatures house themselves in
as a defensive position.

2273
01:52:59,140 --> 01:53:01,854
These creatures are not hunters,
they're more scavengers,

2274
01:53:01,854 --> 01:53:03,834
but they fight in packs
and wait for things to find their way in.

2275
01:53:03,834 --> 01:53:07,028
This tunnel was definitely a place
where they do that to keep fed.

2276
01:53:07,028 --> 01:53:11,164
However, this tunnel appears
to be empty other than

2277
01:53:11,164 --> 01:53:13,869
the strange phenomenon of this energy
in the tunnel.

2278
01:53:13,869 --> 01:53:15,112
ORION: I feel we should camp here
for the night.

2279
01:53:15,112 --> 01:53:18,661
ASHLEY: No more magic?
ORION: Or day, whenever the heck.

2280
01:53:18,661 --> 01:53:21,563
LAURA: Is there anything
that can come through the portal?

2281
01:53:23,393 --> 01:53:25,010
TALIESIN: It's more just an energy shield.

2282
01:53:25,010 --> 01:53:27,359
SAM: Before we plan something,
is there a portal or something?

2283
01:53:27,359 --> 01:53:30,989
MATT: Make an arcana check.
LIAM: Something funky in here.

2284
01:53:30,989 --> 01:53:32,580
ORION: Yes, of course, that's obvious.

2285
01:53:32,580 --> 01:53:33,373
LAURA: What's all this purple stuff?

2286
01:53:33,373 --> 01:53:33,854
LIAM: Well, let's figure it out.

2287
01:53:33,854 --> 01:53:34,315
SAM: 16.

2288
01:53:34,315 --> 01:53:35,876
MATT: 16. As you take a moment

2289
01:53:35,876 --> 01:53:37,397
and step inside
and feel the essence of it,

2290
01:53:37,397 --> 01:53:39,480
there is no portal,
there is no doorway, there is no tear.

2291
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:42,861
There's just a very thin veil
between this plane and another.

2292
01:53:42,861 --> 01:53:46,495
You're unable to really ascertain
the nature of this energy coming through,

2293
01:53:46,495 --> 01:53:50,153
but you're able to see
there is these strange warps in reality.

2294
01:53:50,153 --> 01:53:51,625
As you walk into this room,
you look at your hands,

2295
01:53:51,625 --> 01:53:54,079
and for a second your fingers seem
to bend and go to form.

2296
01:53:54,079 --> 01:53:57,366
As you look at people's faces,
they twist and shift and then go back.

2297
01:53:57,366 --> 01:53:58,519
SAM: I don't think we should camp here.

2298
01:53:58,519 --> 01:53:59,971
MATT: You don't know
if it's purely a visual thing

2299
01:53:59,971 --> 01:54:00,898
or if matter itself is actually twisting,

2300
01:54:00,898 --> 01:54:01,930
but it's very discombobulating
being in this room

2301
01:54:01,930 --> 01:54:02,721
for any length of time.

2302
01:54:02,721 --> 01:54:04,349
LIAM: Clarota,
what are we looking at in here?

2303
01:54:04,349 --> 01:54:06,484
MATT: Clarota, as he enters
behind you guys,

2304
01:54:06,484 --> 01:54:07,723
puts his hands together and goes,

2305
01:54:07,723 --> 01:54:20,363
"This, I believe, is the veil
where K'Varn stepped into the cavern."

2306
01:54:20,363 --> 01:54:22,413
ORION: Yes, exactly.
That's what I was going to say earlier.

2307
01:54:22,413 --> 01:54:25,083
LAURA: Okay, Tiberius.

2308
01:54:25,083 --> 01:54:29,559
ORION: Me, Clarota, mm.
That's what I do with Clarota.

2309
01:54:29,559 --> 01:54:32,987
MATT: The tentacles writhe
around Clarota's maw.

2310
01:54:32,987 --> 01:54:35,633
ORION: That means he likes me.

2311
01:54:35,633 --> 01:54:42,684
MATT: "This is a boundary,
a thin membrane

2312
01:54:42,684 --> 01:54:52,948
"between this Prime Material Plane
and elements of the Far Realm."

2313
01:54:52,948 --> 01:54:54,135
MARISHA: The Far Realm?

2314
01:54:54,135 --> 01:54:56,360
ORION: Ooh, Clarota. Yes.
Do you think we could,

2315
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:58,295
after a rest of course,
conjure a way

2316
01:54:58,295 --> 01:55:01,664
and possibly break the barrier
and go to that side?

2317
01:55:01,664 --> 01:55:08,784
MATT: "You wish not to do that.
Your mind would break."

2318
01:55:08,784 --> 01:55:11,142
ORION: Oh, that would be awful.
I need it.

2319
01:55:11,142 --> 01:55:16,962
SAM: Clarota, is this a possible thing
that we should maybe shut down?

2320
01:55:16,962 --> 01:55:20,245
Could K'Varn send his allies through here?

2321
01:55:20,245 --> 01:55:24,157
MATT: "We have not the power
to shut this down.

2322
01:55:24,157 --> 01:55:29,980
"It is how they overlap."

2323
01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:32,642
LAURA: Is it safe to be near it?

2324
01:55:32,642 --> 01:55:34,257
MATT: "I don't know."

2325
01:55:34,257 --> 01:55:37,509
(all laugh)

2326
01:55:37,509 --> 01:55:38,666
LAURA: I got him, guys, I got him.

2327
01:55:38,686 --> 01:55:40,046
MATT: "We'll have to find out."

2328
01:55:40,046 --> 01:55:41,682
ORION: Well, at least we know
this beach is secure.

2329
01:55:41,682 --> 01:55:43,970
We should go out in the front
and seal this up for the night.

2330
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:44,740
LAURA: You were rather loud.

2331
01:55:44,740 --> 01:55:48,607
I'm afraid things might be drawn
to this beach from that explosion.

2332
01:55:48,607 --> 01:55:50,316
ASHLEY: We could keep watch.

2333
01:55:50,316 --> 01:55:51,694
TRAVIS: I don't need to rest.
I'll stand guard.

2334
01:55:51,694 --> 01:55:52,733
ORION: This is inside and I was outside.
They were hearing stuff inside.

2335
01:55:52,733 --> 01:55:54,655
TALIESIN: Could this veil
exist in sunlight?

2336
01:55:54,655 --> 01:56:03,035
MATT: "I do not know.
I have not traveled the boundary myself."

2337
01:56:03,035 --> 01:56:03,972
LIAM: I wonder what would happen

2338
01:56:03,972 --> 01:56:06,108
if K'Varn was cut off
from the other side of this.

2339
01:56:06,108 --> 01:56:08,086
TALIESIN: That's exactly
what I was thinking.

2340
01:56:08,086 --> 01:56:09,375
LAURA: Maybe it would be good
to block it off.

2341
01:56:09,375 --> 01:56:10,972
LIAM: Or collapse it.

2342
01:56:10,972 --> 01:56:12,948
TALIESIN: At least wall it off
on our way out.

2343
01:56:12,948 --> 01:56:14,991
SAM: Yeah, that's a good idea.
LAURA: I like it.

2344
01:56:14,991 --> 01:56:16,060
TRAVIS: Do that, you two.

2345
01:56:16,060 --> 01:56:18,848
MARISHA: Like, completely cave it in?

2346
01:56:18,848 --> 01:56:21,714
TRAVIS: Yeah, just block it off.
TALIESIN: Just wall it off. Earth-meld it.

2347
01:56:21,714 --> 01:56:25,197
MARISHA: I don't think
throwing up a stone wall

2348
01:56:25,197 --> 01:56:27,486
is going to necessarily stop K'Varn.

2349
01:56:27,486 --> 01:56:29,690
LAURA: No, but can't you use
your rock-changing ability

2350
01:56:29,690 --> 01:56:33,362
and squish all the rocks down
and close the cave off?

2351
01:56:33,362 --> 01:56:35,196
TALIESIN: I was just having
this conversation.

2352
01:56:35,196 --> 01:56:37,998
MARISHA: I can spend time
essentially collapsing the whole thing.

2353
01:56:37,998 --> 01:56:39,008
LAURA: Yeah.

2354
01:56:39,008 --> 01:56:41,478
TRAVIS: I start kicking sand and gravel
into the cave.

2355
01:56:41,478 --> 01:56:44,719
ORION: Wait, how wide
is the slimmest part of the cave?

2356
01:56:44,719 --> 01:56:46,587
MATT: It's about 20, 25 feet.

2357
01:56:46,587 --> 01:56:47,581
LAURA: Keep going, Grog.
You'll get there.

2358
01:56:47,581 --> 01:56:48,793
LIAM: We can camp,

2359
01:56:48,793 --> 01:56:52,141
but it's only been 6 or 7 hours
since we woke up, really.

2360
01:56:52,141 --> 01:56:54,223
MARISHA: It's been longer.

2361
01:56:54,223 --> 01:56:56,556
It was 6 or 7 hours
when we were on that side of the thing.

2362
01:56:56,556 --> 01:56:58,935
TALIESIN: We did take about 8 hours or so.

2363
01:56:58,935 --> 01:56:59,816
LIAM: 8 hours, all right.

2364
01:56:59,816 --> 01:57:01,662
ASHLEY: Some of us can stay up.
I can stay up, keep watch.

2365
01:57:01,662 --> 01:57:02,332
TRAVIS: Me, too.

2366
01:57:02,332 --> 01:57:06,109
MARISHA: There's still things
I want to do.

2367
01:57:06,109 --> 01:57:08,608
LIAM: Spill it, girl, spill it.

2368
01:57:08,608 --> 01:57:11,165
MARISHA: Clarota?

2369
01:57:11,165 --> 01:57:14,546
MATT: "Yes?" His tentacles quiver
as you call his name

2370
01:57:14,546 --> 01:57:20,269
and he looks over at you with a curious,
hungry-to-be-of-service expression

2371
01:57:20,269 --> 01:57:22,844
on his tentacled, mind flayer face.

2372
01:57:22,844 --> 01:57:27,400
MARISHA: Do you have anything
that might assist me in a scrying spell

2373
01:57:27,400 --> 01:57:33,721
to help spy on K'Varn?
Maybe something in his image?

2374
01:57:33,721 --> 01:57:38,436
MATT: "I have not seen K'Varn
with my mind or my eyes.

2375
01:57:38,436 --> 01:57:46,256
"I've only heard of him arriving
after I was cast out of my colony."

2376
01:57:46,256 --> 01:57:48,136
TALIESIN: The description of her dream.

2377
01:57:48,136 --> 01:57:50,113
ASHLEY: Wait, but I had a vision.
I had a dream.

2378
01:57:50,133 --> 01:57:51,228
LAURA: So you know what he looks like?

2379
01:57:51,228 --> 01:57:52,809
MARISHA: Do you know what he looks like?

2380
01:57:52,809 --> 01:57:56,013
ASHLEY: Well, what I saw was like a--

2381
01:57:58,063 --> 01:58:00,353
LAURA: Are those Cheez-Its
you're eating right there?

2382
01:58:00,353 --> 01:58:07,617
ASHLEY: It's what I do when I'm thinking.
I had a little snack pouch.

2383
01:58:07,617 --> 01:58:14,162
TALIESIN: Crackers, all around.
LIAM: It's lembas bread.

2384
01:58:14,162 --> 01:58:24,623
ASHLEY: I saw a single, twisted,
unnatural black horn of--

2385
01:58:24,623 --> 01:58:25,805
MATT: Which Kima mentions again.

2386
01:58:25,805 --> 01:58:31,075
"That. That is what we're trying
to prevent making its way to the surface."

2387
01:58:31,075 --> 01:58:32,686
ORION: I see.
LAURA: Okay.

2388
01:58:32,686 --> 01:58:33,495
MATT: "That's the Horn of Orcus."

2389
01:58:33,495 --> 01:58:35,027
LAURA: Maybe you can envision the horn?

2390
01:58:35,027 --> 01:58:37,256
ASHLEY: Would that work?

2391
01:58:37,256 --> 01:58:41,073
MATT: "I don't know.
I'm not a scrying type."

2392
01:58:41,073 --> 01:58:42,272
ORION: If you'll excuse me.

2393
01:58:42,272 --> 01:58:45,953
I reach into my pouch
and pull up the Scroll of Telescription.

2394
01:58:45,953 --> 01:58:49,743
I enchant it to reach my brother Jerahd.

2395
01:58:49,743 --> 01:58:54,728
I write on it, "Dear brother,
it seems I am in a bit of a pickle

2396
01:58:54,728 --> 01:58:57,691
"with a certain type of creature
that can take control of others

2397
01:58:57,691 --> 01:59:01,064
"with its mind and do nasty things.

2398
01:59:01,064 --> 01:59:04,620
"Goes by the name of K'Varn,
and the only thing I know about him

2399
01:59:04,620 --> 01:59:08,611
"is that he has a black horn.
Please help. Love, Tiberius."

2400
01:59:08,611 --> 01:59:10,859
SAM: I put a little cologne on the page.

2401
01:59:10,859 --> 01:59:12,767
ORION: He can't smell it, Scanlan.

2402
01:59:12,767 --> 01:59:14,554
SAM: Yeah, but it's always a nice gesture.

2403
01:59:14,554 --> 01:59:16,156
ORION: And I send it.

2404
01:59:16,156 --> 01:59:20,223
MATT: Okay, so the scribe
rolls itself on top

2405
01:59:20,223 --> 01:59:21,693
and poof, vanishes in front of you.

2406
01:59:21,713 --> 01:59:25,957
ORION: Hopefully,
he answers back promptly.

2407
01:59:25,957 --> 01:59:27,417
Jerahd is a warlock

2408
01:59:27,417 --> 01:59:32,738
and is a wizard of the mind, arcana,
things I do not know of.

2409
01:59:32,738 --> 01:59:33,835
He could possibly help us

2410
01:59:33,835 --> 01:59:37,503
and has access to great knowledge
in this matter.

2411
01:59:37,503 --> 01:59:38,439
SAM: Phone a friend.

2412
01:59:38,439 --> 01:59:39,594
ASHLEY: Good resource.
LAURA: I like it.

2413
01:59:39,594 --> 01:59:44,603
MARISHA: Well, I guess while we wait
for him to respond,

2414
01:59:44,603 --> 01:59:52,703
I'm going to start using
all of my Stone Shape

2415
01:59:52,703 --> 01:59:57,521
and I'm going to start
bringing down this tunnel.

2416
01:59:57,521 --> 01:59:59,036
TALIESIN: I'm going to work on the boat.

2417
01:59:59,036 --> 02:00:00,745
MARISHA: Just start collapsing it.

2418
02:00:00,745 --> 02:00:01,874
MATT: Okay.

2419
02:00:01,874 --> 02:00:03,414
TRAVIS: Still kicking sand in.

2420
02:00:03,414 --> 02:00:05,950
LAURA: While she's doing that,
can I use my primeval awareness

2421
02:00:05,950 --> 02:00:10,314
and see if there's anything undead
or aberrations

2422
02:00:10,314 --> 02:00:14,720
or things that are around us
that are seeming more active?

2423
02:00:14,720 --> 02:00:16,354
MATT: Okay, you have a long distance
you can pull on that one.

2424
02:00:16,354 --> 02:00:19,503
You take a moment and concentrate.
Not in your immediate vicinity.

2425
02:00:19,503 --> 02:00:23,410
You do sense that across the way,
on that island,

2426
02:00:23,410 --> 02:00:27,670
there are hundreds of aberrations.

2427
02:00:27,670 --> 02:00:30,337
TRAVIS: Hundreds?
TALIESIN: That's two zeros.

2428
02:00:30,337 --> 02:00:31,157
MATT: Hundreds.

2429
02:00:31,157 --> 02:00:33,561
You can't make out the details,
you just sense the presence.

2430
02:00:33,561 --> 02:00:36,811
You see clusters, you see some
wandering the outskirts of the island,

2431
02:00:36,811 --> 02:00:37,848
and the center of the island, you sense

2432
02:00:37,848 --> 02:00:42,786
there is one very strong source
of aberration-based essence.

2433
02:00:42,786 --> 02:00:43,823
MARISHA: On the outskirts of the island?

2434
02:00:43,823 --> 02:00:44,938
MATT: No, in the center.

2435
02:00:44,938 --> 02:00:46,421
LAURA: In the center.
TRAVIS: In the temple.

2436
02:00:46,421 --> 02:00:49,083
LAURA: So. Wait. I'm sensing...

2437
02:00:49,083 --> 02:00:52,466
would that help you
to know that K'Varn is an aberration?

2438
02:00:53,656 --> 02:00:55,877
MARISHA: I'd assume anything helps.

2439
02:00:55,877 --> 02:00:59,971
LAURA: I'm sensing
a really strong energy of an aberration

2440
02:00:59,971 --> 02:01:00,917
in the middle of town.

2441
02:01:00,917 --> 02:01:01,576
MARISHA: Aberration in the center?

2442
02:01:01,576 --> 02:01:03,911
LAURA: And that's something
that would've come out of this portal.

2443
02:01:03,911 --> 02:01:05,001
Right, Clarota?

2444
02:01:05,001 --> 02:01:09,545
MATT: Clarota gives you a look
and says, "Most likely,

2445
02:01:09,545 --> 02:01:16,050
"or at least is related to the kin
from the other side of the veil."

2446
02:01:16,050 --> 02:01:18,803
MARISHA: Wait, what?

2447
02:01:18,803 --> 02:01:20,879
SAM: "Or at least is related to the kin
from the other side of the veil."

2448
02:01:20,879 --> 02:01:22,055
MATT: "That."

2449
02:01:22,055 --> 02:01:23,495
SAM: I speak Clarota.

2450
02:01:23,495 --> 02:01:24,573
MARISHA: Thank you.

2451
02:01:24,573 --> 02:01:27,963
MATT: "Pay attention, druid."

2452
02:01:27,973 --> 02:01:29,463
MARISHA: I was taking notes!

2453
02:01:29,463 --> 02:01:30,724
TALIESIN: He said, "pay attention, druid."

2454
02:01:30,724 --> 02:01:37,268
SAM: While this is going on,
I go near Lady Kima and I start humming.

2455
02:01:37,268 --> 02:01:41,893
I'm going to cast Suggestion on her.

2456
02:01:41,893 --> 02:01:43,156
MATT: Okay.

2457
02:01:43,156 --> 02:01:44,950
SAM: Or try to. I'm just going to say,

2458
02:01:44,950 --> 02:01:53,321
"(singing) Gnome makes you want to
check out Grog's bod,

2459
02:01:53,321 --> 02:01:59,608
"gnome makes you want to
check out his bod and sweat him so hard."

2460
02:01:59,608 --> 02:02:03,024
ORION: Is that B-52s?
SAM: Yeah.

2461
02:02:03,024 --> 02:02:06,208
TRAVIS: I go over to the water
and scoop some and pour it over my head.

2462
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:07,877
(all laugh)

2463
02:02:07,877 --> 02:02:10,694
MATT: As you're doing this, Grog,

2464
02:02:10,694 --> 02:02:12,631
Kima, who at this point
as you got out of this conversation

2465
02:02:12,631 --> 02:02:17,723
is currently rewrapping
the handle of the maul

2466
02:02:17,723 --> 02:02:21,903
that she found earlier in the cavern,
stops what she's doing,

2467
02:02:21,903 --> 02:02:26,373
glances over at Scanlan
with a very stern look and goes,

2468
02:02:26,373 --> 02:02:30,945
"Gnome, I mean no disrespect when I say,
toy with my mind again

2469
02:02:30,945 --> 02:02:33,046
"and you'll find
the business end of this hammer

2470
02:02:33,046 --> 02:02:34,647
"right up your rectum."

2471
02:02:34,647 --> 02:02:36,250
ALL: Oh!

2472
02:02:36,250 --> 02:02:38,316
SAM: And that's the part
I need for shitting on beds,

2473
02:02:38,316 --> 02:02:41,080
so I apologize. I apologize.
I'm sorry.

2474
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:43,408
MATT: "You've bothered me enough recently
with your antics."

2475
02:02:43,408 --> 02:02:46,970
As she does that, she motions
towards your nether region.

2476
02:02:46,970 --> 02:02:49,462
"I'd watch it."

2477
02:02:49,462 --> 02:02:52,626
SAM: I do call it my antic, but yes.
You're right.

2478
02:02:52,626 --> 02:02:55,579
I'm sorry, that was disrespectful.
I apologize.

2479
02:02:55,579 --> 02:03:00,020
I tried, man, come on.
I'm your wingman.

2480
02:03:00,020 --> 02:03:01,874
MATT: She keeps wrapping
the handle of the maul.

2481
02:03:01,874 --> 02:03:03,343
LIAM: Scanlan, she didn't say ant-dick,
she said antic.

2482
02:03:03,343 --> 02:03:05,485
SAM: Thank you, Vax.

2483
02:03:05,485 --> 02:03:09,064
TRAVIS: Did it work?
SAM: I don't think so, Grog.

2484
02:03:09,064 --> 02:03:10,958
MATT: As we're taking a rest
at this moment

2485
02:03:10,958 --> 02:03:12,413
to prepare for whatever you guys
want to do next.

2486
02:03:12,413 --> 02:03:14,675
Let's take a quick restroom break
for the group.

2487
02:03:14,675 --> 02:03:16,310
TALIESIN: Oh my god.
LAURA: Yeah, yes, please.

2488
02:03:16,310 --> 02:03:19,238
MATT: Let's say about a 5-minute break
if we want to just play 3 videos or so.

2489
02:03:19,238 --> 02:03:20,632
We'll make it quick
so we can get back to the game.

2490
02:03:20,632 --> 02:03:22,761
ZAC: Hold up, before you go off--

2491
02:03:22,761 --> 02:03:25,489
MATT: Before we do that, all right,
just a second.

2492
02:03:25,489 --> 02:03:27,169
LAURA: There's things happening.
MATT: Things are happening.

2493
02:03:27,169 --> 02:03:29,870
ZAC: I have a present from the chat room.

2494
02:03:29,870 --> 02:03:32,056
ALL: Whoa!

2495
02:03:32,056 --> 02:03:34,069
ZAC: It is a happy 10th episode
Critical Role cake.

2496
02:03:34,069 --> 02:03:34,851
ALL: Aww!

2497
02:03:34,851 --> 02:03:38,841
MATT: You guys are so awesome!
LAURA: That's so sweet!

2498
02:03:38,841 --> 02:03:42,012
ZAC: Also, in honor of the twins.

2499
02:03:42,012 --> 02:03:43,525
MATT: All right,
so they came in from this side.

2500
02:03:43,525 --> 02:03:44,775
SAM: Wow.
LAURA: Aw, you guys!

2501
02:03:44,775 --> 02:03:48,060
SAM: We get one of those
every two episodes!

2502
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:49,304
(all laugh)

2503
02:03:49,304 --> 02:03:50,434
SAM: Wow, that's great!

2504
02:03:50,434 --> 02:03:51,594
MATT: Guys, that's great.
Thank you so much!

2505
02:03:51,594 --> 02:03:53,356
TALIESIN: This aberration is a cake!

2506
02:03:53,356 --> 02:03:55,703
ZAC: So while you guys are on break,
you'll get yourselves some cake.

2507
02:03:55,703 --> 02:03:58,587
But before we cut to the videos,

2508
02:03:58,587 --> 02:04:00,480
I just want to remind everyone
watching from the front page

2509
02:04:00,480 --> 02:04:06,308
that we are 140 shirts away
from getting to a thousand shirts sold,

2510
02:04:06,308 --> 02:04:09,308
and at a thousand, we will do a live Q&amp;A
after the show tonight.

2511
02:04:09,308 --> 02:04:10,341
MATT: Yep.

2512
02:04:10,341 --> 02:04:11,794
ZAC: So we have an hour
to sell 140 shirts.

2513
02:04:11,794 --> 02:04:13,126
SAM: Or sweatshirts.

2514
02:04:13,126 --> 02:04:15,595
ZAC: Or sweatshirts.
There's hoodies on there.

2515
02:04:15,595 --> 02:04:17,491
Women's cut tees.

2516
02:04:17,491 --> 02:04:18,315
LAURA: I still haven't ordered mine.
I need to get my hoodie.

2517
02:04:18,315 --> 02:04:20,218
ZAC: Male tees.

2518
02:04:20,218 --> 02:04:20,908
MATT: Presents for your friends?

2519
02:04:20,908 --> 02:04:22,077
TRAVIS: Presents for your friends!

2520
02:04:22,077 --> 02:04:24,509
ORION: Yeah, that's cool.
TRAVIS: That's a good gift.

2521
02:04:24,509 --> 02:04:25,053
ZAC: All you've got to do
is scroll down on the channel

2522
02:04:25,053 --> 02:04:26,259
or join the chat room,

2523
02:04:26,259 --> 02:04:27,429
or you'll see every once in a while
the ads show up on the front page.

2524
02:04:27,429 --> 02:04:28,125
ORION: I'm going to really enjoy it.

2525
02:04:28,125 --> 02:04:29,649
ZAC: So get a t-shirt.
We're pretty close.

2526
02:04:29,649 --> 02:04:33,409
I think we're only 40 subs away
or something, Lucas?

2527
02:04:33,409 --> 02:04:34,476
TALIESIN: Whoa.

2528
02:04:34,476 --> 02:04:37,788
ZAC: From a tabletop promo giveaway,

2529
02:04:37,788 --> 02:04:39,915
and we'll have all these guys
sign a poster

2530
02:04:39,915 --> 02:04:41,511
and include that with shipping.

2531
02:04:41,511 --> 02:04:42,958
If you're wondering why
you should sub this channel,

2532
02:04:42,958 --> 02:04:44,813
it helps keep shows like this,

2533
02:04:44,813 --> 02:04:47,067
and we have a lot
of other programming

2534
02:04:47,067 --> 02:04:50,619
like a live comic book show,
cosplay show.

2535
02:04:50,619 --> 02:04:55,290
We have live music every Friday night.
It's a good time. So you should sub.

2536
02:04:55,290 --> 02:04:57,219
And I guess let's cut to the break.

2537
02:04:57,219 --> 02:04:58,062
TRAVIS: I've got to pee!

2538
02:04:58,062 --> 02:04:59,961
MATT: 5-minute break guys, make it quick.

2539
02:04:59,961 --> 02:05:03,595
We'll see you back here in 5 minutes.
Thank you.

2540
02:05:03,595 --> 02:06:05,021
[dramatic music]

2541
02:06:11,329 --> 02:06:13,520
ASHLEY: Pike grew up 
in the outskirts of town,

2542
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:14,926
near the Bramblewood.

2543
02:06:14,926 --> 02:06:17,112
Her ancestors 
were a family of deep gnomes

2544
02:06:17,112 --> 02:06:20,070
with quite an unfavorable reputation.

2545
02:06:20,070 --> 02:06:22,013
Thievery, destruction, and trickery

2546
02:06:22,013 --> 02:06:26,341
left them with the curse 
of the last name Trickfoot.

2547
02:06:26,341 --> 02:06:29,243
Sarenrae, 
the goddess of healing and redemption,

2548
02:06:29,243 --> 02:06:32,919
had other plans for Pike's 
great-great-grandfather Wilhand,

2549
02:06:32,919 --> 02:06:36,593
who left his family at a young age
after a dream,

2550
02:06:36,593 --> 02:06:39,847
a dream that changed the course 
of the Trickfoot family.

2551
02:06:39,847 --> 02:06:43,772
Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae
and pledged from then on

2552
02:06:43,772 --> 02:06:48,182
that him and his family
would live a life of service and devotion.

2553
02:06:48,182 --> 02:06:51,754
As a child, 
Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal.

2554
02:06:51,754 --> 02:06:55,885
Whether it was animals, people, 
or even flowers,

2555
02:06:55,885 --> 02:06:58,655
she felt she had a purpose 
in making things whole

2556
02:06:58,655 --> 02:06:59,819
that had once been broken.

2557
02:06:59,819 --> 02:07:03,700
She studied and learned 
the ways to heal though divine magic.

2558
02:07:03,700 --> 02:07:07,202
She lived a peaceful life, 
quiet and simple,

2559
02:07:07,202 --> 02:07:11,015
until one day, 
Wilhand was captured and almost killed

2560
02:07:11,015 --> 02:07:13,702
by a group of goliath barbarians.

2561
02:07:13,702 --> 02:07:17,295
One of the goliaths took a stand
against the murder of the innocent gnome

2562
02:07:17,295 --> 02:07:22,109
and he himself was beaten, bloodied, 
and left for dead, abandoned by his herd.

2563
02:07:22,109 --> 02:07:25,005
Wilhand went to Pike for help.

2564
02:07:25,005 --> 02:07:27,925
She prayed and healed this barbarian
as best she could,

2565
02:07:27,925 --> 02:07:31,311
bringing him back to life.

2566
02:07:31,311 --> 02:07:35,975
When he awoke, she discovered 
his name was Grog Strongjaw.

2567
02:07:35,975 --> 02:07:40,717
After that, they were best of friends,
a rather unlikely pair.

2568
02:07:40,717 --> 02:07:43,502
Little did she know 
that in a few years' time,

2569
02:07:43,502 --> 02:07:46,744
Grog would soon return the favor

2570
02:07:46,744 --> 02:07:51,760
and bring her back 
from the clutches of death.

2571
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:55,322
After being killed in battle, 
Pike felt angry.

2572
02:07:55,322 --> 02:07:59,257
She wanted to be stronger
so that it would never happen again.

2573
02:07:59,257 --> 02:08:01,170
She spent four months at sea

2574
02:08:01,170 --> 02:08:05,406
training with the men and women
aboard a ship called the Broken Howl.

2575
02:08:05,406 --> 02:08:09,591
Gripping her holy symbol in one hand,
and her morningstar in the other,

2576
02:08:09,591 --> 02:08:12,774
this time, Pike is ready.

2577
02:08:14,691 --> 02:08:16,598
TRAVIS: Right, Listen up!

2578
02:08:16,598 --> 02:08:21,559
If you have ale, 
then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw.

2579
02:08:21,559 --> 02:08:25,332
A goliath of towering height and size,

2580
02:08:25,332 --> 02:08:30,349
this barbarian has an appetite 
for the two great loves in his life:

2581
02:08:30,349 --> 02:08:34,552
combat, women, and ale! (chuckle)

2582
02:08:34,552 --> 02:08:35,550
(record scratch) Wait.

2583
02:08:35,550 --> 02:08:41,075
Easily the brains of the group, 
Grog is often consulted

2584
02:08:41,075 --> 02:08:46,272
for his vast knowledge of shapes, 
colors, and (chuckle) shiny things!

2585
02:08:46,272 --> 02:08:48,005
Also ale.

2586
02:08:48,005 --> 02:08:52,155
In his early years, 
armed with his two handed great axe,

2587
02:08:52,155 --> 02:08:54,784
Grog often enjoyed proving his might

2588
02:08:54,784 --> 02:08:58,114
amongst the ranks 
of his family's wandering herd.

2589
02:08:58,114 --> 02:09:02,558
But after coming upon an unsuspecting 
elderly gnome in the woods,

2590
02:09:02,558 --> 02:09:06,702
he objected to the killing 
of such an innocent life.

2591
02:09:06,702 --> 02:09:11,904
A creature of impulse, 
Grog felt only pity for this--

2592
02:09:11,904 --> 02:09:14,995
well, this terrified little thing.

2593
02:09:14,995 --> 02:09:17,708
And his disobedience cost him dearly.
(weapon crack)

2594
02:09:17,708 --> 02:09:23,020
Beaten bloody and banished 
by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak,

2595
02:09:23,020 --> 02:09:26,372
Grog was abandoned and left to die.

2596
02:09:26,372 --> 02:09:28,871
Exiled from his herd,

2597
02:09:28,871 --> 02:09:32,757
it was then that the relative 
of the very gnome he fought to save,

2598
02:09:32,757 --> 02:09:35,454
saved him.

2599
02:09:35,454 --> 02:09:37,892
It was the kindness 
of a gnome cleric named Pike

2600
02:09:37,892 --> 02:09:43,115
that healed Grog, 
bringing him back from death's edge.

2601
02:09:43,115 --> 02:09:46,835
And they have remained close friends 
ever since.

2602
02:09:46,835 --> 02:09:48,194
Most nights, Grog can be found

2603
02:09:48,194 --> 02:09:52,895
challenging entire taverns 
to wrestling matches! Ha!

2604
02:09:52,895 --> 02:09:55,253
or accompanying Scanlan 
to the nearest house

2605
02:09:55,253 --> 02:09:58,843
where you pay for... lady favors.

2606
02:09:58,843 --> 02:10:02,303
Also ale!

2607
02:10:02,303 --> 02:10:03,767
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth

2608
02:10:03,767 --> 02:10:07,486
would leave you with little information
on the half-elven druid.

2609
02:10:07,486 --> 02:10:09,621
You might even think 
that her social awkwardness

2610
02:10:09,621 --> 02:10:13,038
due to her sheltered upbringing 
is kind of sweet. (chuckle)

2611
02:10:13,038 --> 02:10:16,599
Of course, it would be unwise 
to underestimate her

2612
02:10:16,599 --> 02:10:19,764
based on first impressions.
(thunder crack)

2613
02:10:19,764 --> 02:10:21,702
Under that unintimidating petite frame

2614
02:10:21,702 --> 02:10:24,760
is a vicious beast 
waiting to be unleashed,

2615
02:10:24,760 --> 02:10:27,412
whose natural powers
have made even the fiercest of champions

2616
02:10:27,412 --> 02:10:31,789
pee their pants, literally! (soft chuckle)

2617
02:10:31,789 --> 02:10:34,126
Born to the Air Tribe 
of the Ashari people,

2618
02:10:34,126 --> 02:10:38,586
Keyleth was raised with a deep love
of nature and the elemental magics.

2619
02:10:38,586 --> 02:10:40,378
It is her people's inherent duty

2620
02:10:40,378 --> 02:10:43,137
to protect 
the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

2621
02:10:43,137 --> 02:10:47,756
where the four elemental planes 
begin to bleed with this realm.

2622
02:10:47,756 --> 02:10:49,647
Since she was a little girl, 
she had quite a knack

2623
02:10:49,647 --> 02:10:52,910
for air manipulation 
and beast shaping abilities.

2624
02:10:52,910 --> 02:10:57,140
Well, if you consider kittens and 
flying squirrels to be little beasts.

2625
02:10:57,140 --> 02:11:00,107
Which, I do. (clears throat)

2626
02:11:00,107 --> 02:11:03,064
Anyways, it wasn't long 
before the headmaster of the tribe,

2627
02:11:03,064 --> 02:11:07,021
her father, Korren,
realized her true prodigious abilities

2628
02:11:07,021 --> 02:11:11,127
and she was inveterated 
to succeed him as the next headmaster.

2629
02:11:11,127 --> 02:11:14,589
Just like that, 
her jovial childhood was stripped

2630
02:11:14,589 --> 02:11:17,165
and replaced 
with endless spell memorization,

2631
02:11:17,165 --> 02:11:21,537
teachings from ancient traditions, 
and exceedingly high expectations.

2632
02:11:21,537 --> 02:11:22,590
Every druid leader to be

2633
02:11:22,590 --> 02:11:25,812
must embark on journey 
to seek out the sister tribes

2634
02:11:25,812 --> 02:11:28,259
in order to introduce 
and establish respect

2635
02:11:28,259 --> 02:11:30,937
amongst the fellow headmasters.

2636
02:11:30,937 --> 02:11:34,304
They call this the AraMente, 
or Noble Odyssey.

2637
02:11:34,304 --> 02:11:36,310
When her father felt she was ready,

2638
02:11:36,310 --> 02:11:39,716
he set her on the path 
to truly discovering herself.

2639
02:11:39,716 --> 02:11:44,007
Not knowing when, or if, 
she will ever return.

2640
02:11:44,007 --> 02:11:45,861
As she hiked down the mountain 
towards Stillben,

2641
02:11:45,861 --> 02:11:48,256
she meditated on the task ahead.

2642
02:11:48,256 --> 02:11:49,500
Part of the AraMente

2643
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:54,461
is proving yourself a strong warrior, 
a valiant protector,

2644
02:11:54,461 --> 02:11:56,483
and a wise and compassionate leader.

2645
02:11:56,483 --> 02:12:01,291
With this knowledge, 
one thought plays in repeat in her mind:

2646
02:12:01,291 --> 02:12:04,891
Is she even worthy?

2647
02:12:05,901 --> 02:12:08,149
TALIESIN: Percy was the third 
of seven children,

2648
02:12:08,149 --> 02:12:10,719
born to a noble family who lived 
far to the north

2649
02:12:10,719 --> 02:12:13,891
in the ancient castle of Whitestone.

2650
02:12:13,891 --> 02:12:16,441
With so many siblings 
to share the burdens of lordship,

2651
02:12:16,441 --> 02:12:17,596
Percy turned his attentions

2652
02:12:17,596 --> 02:12:22,205
to the sciences, 
engineering, and naturalism.

2653
02:12:22,205 --> 02:12:25,362
One day, a mysterious couple 
named Lord and Lady Briarwood

2654
02:12:25,362 --> 02:12:26,310
came to court.

2655
02:12:26,310 --> 02:12:28,417
During a feast held in their honor,

2656
02:12:28,417 --> 02:12:31,468
the Briarwoods violently 
took control of the castle,

2657
02:12:31,468 --> 02:12:36,265
killing or imprisoning 
everyone who would stand in their way.

2658
02:12:36,265 --> 02:12:39,948
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, 
only to be freed by his younger sister.

2659
02:12:39,948 --> 02:12:43,855
Together they fled, 
chased by the Briarwoods' men.

2660
02:12:43,855 --> 02:12:49,310
As they ran, Percy's sister took 
several arrows to the chest and fell.

2661
02:12:49,310 --> 02:12:50,858
Percy kept running,

2662
02:12:50,858 --> 02:12:55,343
eventually jumping into a freezing river
and floating unconscious to freedom.

2663
02:12:55,343 --> 02:12:57,712
He did not remember 
waking up on a fishing boat.

2664
02:12:57,712 --> 02:12:59,555
He barely remembered 
the next two years,

2665
02:12:59,555 --> 02:13:04,179
as he slowly made his way 
as far south as possible.

2666
02:13:04,179 --> 02:13:06,907
Then one night, Percy had a dream.

2667
02:13:06,907 --> 02:13:09,415
A roaring cloud of smoke 
offered him vengeance

2668
02:13:09,415 --> 02:13:12,208
against those who destroyed his family.

2669
02:13:12,208 --> 02:13:16,514
When he awoke, 
Percy began to design his first gun.

2670
02:13:16,514 --> 02:13:20,492
(gunshot)

2671
02:13:20,492 --> 02:13:22,734
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard 
of Scanlan Shorthalt?

2672
02:13:22,734 --> 02:13:26,148
Well, gird your loins, ladies, 
because he has his eye on you.

2673
02:13:26,148 --> 02:13:28,729
A talented musician, 
master of disguise,

2674
02:13:28,729 --> 02:13:31,161
and dashingly handsome 
in his own mind,

2675
02:13:31,161 --> 02:13:36,249
Scanlan sings songs almost as much 
as he sings his own praises.

2676
02:13:36,249 --> 02:13:39,315
Born a poor gnome, 
Scanlan used his endless charm

2677
02:13:39,315 --> 02:13:43,939
and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin 
and support his single mother.

2678
02:13:43,939 --> 02:13:46,467
One day he was discovered 
by a half-orc promoter,

2679
02:13:46,467 --> 02:13:50,825
and joined Dr. Dranzel's 
Spectacular Traveling Troupe,

2680
02:13:50,825 --> 02:13:52,795
where he learned the ways of the world,

2681
02:13:52,805 --> 02:13:56,779
and honed his skills 
as a bard extraordinaire.

2682
02:13:56,779 --> 02:13:59,898
A loner much of his life, 
Scanlan has never quite come to terms

2683
02:13:59,898 --> 02:14:03,600
with the violent death of his mother 
at the hands of a goblin invasion.

2684
02:14:03,600 --> 02:14:07,659
While his years on the road 
provided many, shall we say,

2685
02:14:07,659 --> 02:14:10,624
educational experiences 
with the opposite sex--

2686
02:14:11,111 --> 02:14:14,421
MATT: Welcome back. Break is finished.

2687
02:14:14,421 --> 02:14:18,007
Once again, I want to remind you guys,
we're just a little over 100 shirts left.

2688
02:14:18,007 --> 02:14:20,179
If we can manage to get to 1000
in the next 45 minutes--

2689
02:14:20,179 --> 02:14:21,301
SAM: It's going to be tight.

2690
02:14:21,301 --> 02:14:22,563
LAURA: It's going to be tight.

2691
02:14:22,563 --> 02:14:23,273
TRAVIS: Gifts. Gifts for your friends
and family. Your pets.

2692
02:14:23,273 --> 02:14:24,484
MATT: Shop for your buddies' birthdays--

2693
02:14:24,484 --> 02:14:26,200
LIAM: Your friends are going
to be watching the show in under a month.

2694
02:14:26,200 --> 02:14:28,252
SAM: You know what?

2695
02:14:28,252 --> 02:14:30,989
Just buy them and then return them
after the show's over.

2696
02:14:30,989 --> 02:14:32,281
(all laugh)

2697
02:14:32,281 --> 02:14:33,039
SAM: It's fine.
ORION: Just do that.

2698
02:14:33,039 --> 02:14:34,333
SAM: We'll take it.
MATT: Don't do that.

2699
02:14:34,333 --> 02:14:35,835
LAURA: Don't do that.

2700
02:14:35,835 --> 02:14:37,237
MATT: Yeah, no worries, guys.

2701
02:14:37,237 --> 02:14:39,833
So to bring this back to where we were,

2702
02:14:39,833 --> 02:14:44,092
you guys have been puttering around
after you're clearing out this cavern

2703
02:14:44,092 --> 02:14:49,376
on the northern shore
of this large cave surrounding Yug'Voril.

2704
02:14:49,396 --> 02:14:52,509
What is your current plan of action?

2705
02:14:52,509 --> 02:14:54,159
TRAVIS: While they've been sleeping,
I took my axe--

2706
02:14:54,159 --> 02:14:54,838
SAM: Wait, did we sleep?

2707
02:14:54,838 --> 02:14:56,075
MATT: You guys didn't end up resting,
I think.

2708
02:14:56,075 --> 02:14:56,920
TRAVIS: Oh, no?
MATT: Just been preparing.

2709
02:14:56,920 --> 02:14:57,610
TRAVIS: I thought we rested.

2710
02:14:57,630 --> 02:14:58,883
LAURA: No, we haven't rested.

2711
02:14:58,883 --> 02:15:00,617
MARISHA: I've been collapsing that cavern.

2712
02:15:00,617 --> 02:15:02,326
MATT: You manage to make a way

2713
02:15:02,326 --> 02:15:06,477
where the central focal point
of this cavern's entrance,

2714
02:15:06,477 --> 02:15:10,637
you manage to eventually carve
all the stone to close it off.

2715
02:15:10,637 --> 02:15:14,354
MARISHA: Okay. Tiberius!
ORION: Yes?

2716
02:15:14,354 --> 02:15:16,554
MARISHA: Has your brother
gotten back to you yet?

2717
02:15:16,554 --> 02:15:21,296
ORION: He should've
got the message immediately.

2718
02:15:21,296 --> 02:15:24,052
I'm pretty sure
he's researching it before he answers.

2719
02:15:24,052 --> 02:15:28,729
MATT: About 20 minutes of you doing this,
as you're having this discussion,

2720
02:15:28,729 --> 02:15:32,732
a small slip of parchment
apparates in front of you

2721
02:15:32,732 --> 02:15:35,859
with a flash of purplish energy.

2722
02:15:35,859 --> 02:15:41,552
Written upon it, it says,
"Tiberius, you speak of the Far Realm,

2723
02:15:41,552 --> 02:15:45,229
"which I am quite familiar with;
there are many aberrations.

2724
02:15:45,229 --> 02:15:48,723
"However, I do not know
the name K'Varn per se.

2725
02:15:48,723 --> 02:15:50,302
"In my research,
there are many things

2726
02:15:50,302 --> 02:15:51,802
"that can fall
under the description you say.

2727
02:15:51,802 --> 02:15:53,162
"It's vague enough.

2728
02:15:53,182 --> 02:15:55,490
"Unfortunately,
I have not much to go off of.

2729
02:15:55,490 --> 02:15:58,998
"If you had an image
or a visual description of this creature

2730
02:15:58,998 --> 02:16:00,161
"I'd be able to help,

2731
02:16:00,161 --> 02:16:04,105
"but at the moment I have no way
of giving you any more knowledge.

2732
02:16:04,105 --> 02:16:05,957
"My apologies,"
and signed at the bottom.

2733
02:16:05,957 --> 02:16:10,453
SAM: May I see this?
(sniffs) Hmm, Draconiar Noir.

2734
02:16:10,453 --> 02:16:12,467
(all laugh)

2735
02:16:12,467 --> 02:16:20,282
ORION: You are astute.
I say all that stuff out loud.

2736
02:16:20,282 --> 02:16:22,318
TRAVIS: I start digging a ditch
with my axe in the sand.

2737
02:16:22,318 --> 02:16:23,279
MATT: Okay.

2738
02:16:23,279 --> 02:16:25,640
LAURA: What are you digging there, Grog?

2739
02:16:25,640 --> 02:16:26,477
TALIESIN: I'm going to work
on the camouflage.

2740
02:16:26,477 --> 02:16:27,738
TRAVIS: Don't worry about it.

2741
02:16:27,738 --> 02:16:31,215
MATT: Go ahead and make
another tinker check.

2742
02:16:31,215 --> 02:16:34,825
SAM: Are we in the cavern?
No, we're on the beach, right?

2743
02:16:34,825 --> 02:16:36,340
MATT: You guys are on the beach.
SAM: Oh, thank god.

2744
02:16:36,340 --> 02:16:38,985
LAURA: Can we hear any kind of movement
coming from the other island?

2745
02:16:38,985 --> 02:16:40,878
Does it seem like
they heard those explosions?

2746
02:16:40,878 --> 02:16:41,661
Are we safe here?

2747
02:16:41,661 --> 02:16:47,703
MATT: The island itself I'd say
is about a quarter- to a half-mile away.

2748
02:16:47,703 --> 02:16:51,109
It's hard to tell from this distance
with no light source,

2749
02:16:51,109 --> 02:16:54,781
any movement whatsoever over there,
or any sound they make over there.

2750
02:16:54,781 --> 02:16:56,998
LIAM: Oh, so it's really dark?

2751
02:16:56,998 --> 02:17:00,279
MATT: Yes, other than
the bioluminescent fungal plant life

2752
02:17:00,279 --> 02:17:01,380
and forest that coats this side.

2753
02:17:01,380 --> 02:17:02,949
You have no light source 
on that side whatsoever.

2754
02:17:02,949 --> 02:17:03,876
LIAM: All right.
LAURA: Okay.

2755
02:17:03,876 --> 02:17:05,047
MATT: And it's just faint enough

2756
02:17:05,047 --> 02:17:06,616
where you can make out
the outline of the island itself,

2757
02:17:06,616 --> 02:17:08,880
but beyond that
you have very little visual.

2758
02:17:08,880 --> 02:17:10,037
SAM: Let's sleep.

2759
02:17:10,037 --> 02:17:17,865
MARISHA: Is there any type of stone
or rock or debris

2760
02:17:17,865 --> 02:17:27,143
with the residual energy
from the purple mists of the Far Realm?

2761
02:17:27,143 --> 02:17:28,435
MATT: It doesn't necessarily cling.

2762
02:17:28,435 --> 02:17:32,194
It's more of a presence thing
than it is a material clinging energy.

2763
02:17:33,554 --> 02:17:35,581
MARISHA: Okay.

2764
02:17:35,581 --> 02:17:38,245
LIAM: Also, I'm sorry,

2765
02:17:38,245 --> 02:17:41,858
if it's this dark in here,
we lit up the cave.

2766
02:17:41,858 --> 02:17:43,936
Anyone on that island
would have seen that.

2767
02:17:43,936 --> 02:17:46,421
I don't think it's very safe here.

2768
02:17:46,421 --> 02:17:49,253
SAM: Where do you want to go?

2769
02:17:49,253 --> 02:17:50,883
LAURA: He's doing a camouflage-y thing,

2770
02:17:50,883 --> 02:17:52,250
and she can make it look
like nothing's on the--

2771
02:17:52,250 --> 02:17:54,715
LIAM: I know that,
but no one camouflaged

2772
02:17:54,715 --> 02:17:56,966
the explosion of fire
that lit up the cave.

2773
02:17:56,966 --> 02:17:57,644
SAM: Then let's get out of here.

2774
02:17:57,644 --> 02:18:00,218
Why don't we go to the island
and see if we can make camp?

2775
02:18:00,218 --> 02:18:02,242
TALIESIN: Let's head
to those little buildings

2776
02:18:02,242 --> 02:18:02,949
off the corner there.

2777
02:18:02,949 --> 02:18:04,545
MARISHA: Not yet.
LAURA: Hide?

2778
02:18:04,545 --> 02:18:05,865
ORION: I do not think that is wise.

2779
02:18:05,865 --> 02:18:06,653
SAM: What? What's wrong?

2780
02:18:06,653 --> 02:18:14,073
MARISHA: I'm going to sit down
near where the Far Plane portal is.

2781
02:18:14,073 --> 02:18:17,758
MATT: Which you already closed off
at this point in time.

2782
02:18:17,758 --> 02:18:18,926
MARISHA: I want to be near it, though.

2783
02:18:18,926 --> 02:18:21,166
MATT: So you're near the edge of the wall
where you've already blocked it off?

2784
02:18:21,166 --> 02:18:21,522
MARISHA: Right.

2785
02:18:21,522 --> 02:18:23,394
MATT: Okay. So you get closer
to that presence.

2786
02:18:23,394 --> 02:18:27,265
MARISHA: Yeah, so I can be close to it.

2787
02:18:27,265 --> 02:18:34,306
And Clarota? Pike?
Do any of you want to help me in this?

2788
02:18:34,306 --> 02:18:36,122
SAM: What are you doing?

2789
02:18:36,122 --> 02:18:37,530
MARISHA: I'm going to do my scrying spell.
SAM: Oh, okay.

2790
02:18:37,530 --> 02:18:40,685
ASHLEY: I can assist
because I have that, as well.

2791
02:18:40,685 --> 02:18:45,167
MATT: You do have Scrying as a spell.

2792
02:18:45,167 --> 02:18:50,361
I would say if you both expend--
if you have it prepared.

2793
02:18:50,361 --> 02:18:52,910
Do you have scrying prepared?

2794
02:18:52,910 --> 02:18:55,031
ASHLEY: No.

2795
02:18:55,031 --> 02:18:56,114
(all laugh)

2796
02:18:56,114 --> 02:18:57,806
MATT: All right, well,
we'll see what we can do.

2797
02:18:57,806 --> 02:19:00,048
MARISHA: Can I say that
because I prepared it, I can be like,

2798
02:19:00,048 --> 02:19:04,345
"Here's my book. You can borrow it.
I wrote it down. I know you know it."

2799
02:19:04,345 --> 02:19:06,451
MATT: Well, see, for druids,
it's not so much a spellbook

2800
02:19:06,451 --> 02:19:07,192
more than it is just an innate nature.

2801
02:19:07,192 --> 02:19:09,940
You have a book for your own note-taking,
but the actual spell itself

2802
02:19:09,940 --> 02:19:13,908
comes from you harnessing
the divine energy of nature around you.

2803
02:19:13,908 --> 02:19:16,616
So there wouldn't be a way

2804
02:19:16,616 --> 02:19:18,503
that it should be able to help you
in that spell,

2805
02:19:18,503 --> 02:19:20,993
more than a slight bonus to the DC,

2806
02:19:20,993 --> 02:19:22,005
but I'll keep that in mind.

2807
02:19:22,005 --> 02:19:25,053
MARISHA: Scanlan, can you give me
some meditation music?

2808
02:19:25,053 --> 02:19:27,502
SAM: Would that help at all?

2809
02:19:27,502 --> 02:19:29,158
MATT: Yeah.
Definitely would give inspiration.

2810
02:19:29,158 --> 02:19:31,463
ORION: Your Highness,
hold on a second, wait a minute!

2811
02:19:31,463 --> 02:19:32,109
MARISHA: What?

2812
02:19:32,109 --> 02:19:33,653
ORION: I think we're doing this
a bit prematurely.

2813
02:19:33,653 --> 02:19:35,501
MARISHA: Why?
SAM: She can do it again tomorrow.

2814
02:19:35,501 --> 02:19:37,979
ORION: If she fails,
he will know where we are.

2815
02:19:37,979 --> 02:19:39,537
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: True.

2816
02:19:39,537 --> 02:19:41,469
MARISHA: He knows we're here already!

2817
02:19:41,469 --> 02:19:47,841
He possessed the queen and said,
"Welcome, you're my treasured guests."

2818
02:19:47,841 --> 02:19:50,161
Remember that?
He knows exactly where we are!

2819
02:19:50,161 --> 02:19:51,406
SAM: That's a good impression.

2820
02:19:51,406 --> 02:19:52,775
ASHLEY: That's a really good point.
TALIESIN: It is actually very good.

2821
02:19:52,775 --> 02:19:54,638
ORION: It was because
he had eyes to look through.

2822
02:19:54,638 --> 02:19:57,308
MARISHA: He seems to be pretty powerful
and all-knowing.

2823
02:19:57,308 --> 02:19:58,684
I'm pretty sure
he probably knows we're fucking here.

2824
02:19:58,684 --> 02:19:59,635
TALIESIN: I think this
is a reasonable risk.

2825
02:19:59,635 --> 02:20:00,982
LAURA: He's probably
just playing with us right now,

2826
02:20:00,982 --> 02:20:02,998
waiting for us to get there.

2827
02:20:02,998 --> 02:20:04,999
MARISHA: He said,
"You are our treasured guests."

2828
02:20:04,999 --> 02:20:06,488
I wrote it down.

2829
02:20:06,488 --> 02:20:08,015
LIAM: He knows we're coming.

2830
02:20:08,015 --> 02:20:09,205
MARISHA: He knows we're coming.
He wants us to come.

2831
02:20:09,225 --> 02:20:11,002
TRAVIS: To inspire Keyleth
with her scrying spell,

2832
02:20:11,002 --> 02:20:12,657
I hop in the ditch I've been digging

2833
02:20:12,657 --> 02:20:15,446
and start going,
"Look, I can do it too! (laughs)"

2834
02:20:15,446 --> 02:20:17,801
And I start paddling in the ditch.

2835
02:20:17,801 --> 02:20:19,398
MARISHA: Oh! Good job, Grog! You did it!

2836
02:20:19,398 --> 02:20:21,199
TRAVIS: Is that inspiration?

2837
02:20:21,199 --> 02:20:23,923
MATT: You feel inspired.

2838
02:20:23,923 --> 02:20:26,326
MARISHA: Besides,
we're talking about moving anyway, right?

2839
02:20:26,326 --> 02:20:29,073
So I might as well do it here
if we're going to relocate.

2840
02:20:29,074 --> 02:20:33,031
Plus, I want to be
near the energy of the Far Realm.

2841
02:20:33,031 --> 02:20:34,268
Maybe it'll help a little bit?

2842
02:20:34,268 --> 02:20:34,912
MATT: It's possible.

2843
02:20:34,912 --> 02:20:36,939
MARISHA: It's what I'm hoping for.
TALIESIN: Let's go for it.

2844
02:20:36,939 --> 02:20:41,326
SAM: All right!
So I'll sing to inspire her.

2845
02:20:41,326 --> 02:20:43,681
"Scry, scry, Miss Keyleth, scry,

2846
02:20:43,681 --> 02:20:48,922
"put your eyeballs to the K'Varn
and tell us why."

2847
02:20:48,922 --> 02:20:51,190
All right, no, that's it.

2848
02:20:51,190 --> 02:20:54,111
TALIESIN: Singing, "This will be the day
that I scry."

2849
02:20:54,111 --> 02:20:57,293
ALL: "This will be the day that I scry!"

2850
02:20:57,293 --> 02:20:58,518
(all laugh)

2851
02:20:58,518 --> 02:20:59,727
MATT: All right, then.

2852
02:20:59,727 --> 02:21:02,398
MARISHA: So wait,
do I get two inspiration dice?

2853
02:21:02,398 --> 02:21:03,837
MATT: No. You can only have
one inspiration dice

2854
02:21:03,837 --> 02:21:05,522
at any given point in time,
and it's a d10.

2855
02:21:05,522 --> 02:21:08,582
MARISHA: Okay, but I'm happy
because of Grog, right?

2856
02:21:08,582 --> 02:21:10,399
MATT: You are!
SAM: Yes. You get happiness.

2857
02:21:10,399 --> 02:21:13,319
MATT: So you're smiling
through the spell.

2858
02:21:13,319 --> 02:21:15,934
(laughs) All right, so,
you take ten minutes to yourself

2859
02:21:15,934 --> 02:21:17,019
to prepare the ritual.

2860
02:21:17,019 --> 02:21:19,169
You carve out a portion of the beach

2861
02:21:19,169 --> 02:21:22,067
where the gravel
is most easy to manipulate,

2862
02:21:22,067 --> 02:21:24,319
and you begin to set up
this extensive scrying ritual.

2863
02:21:24,319 --> 02:21:28,013
MARISHA: And I want to meditate
specifically on the horn,

2864
02:21:28,013 --> 02:21:31,601
and I want to use Pike
and see if I can channel her vision,

2865
02:21:31,601 --> 02:21:37,879
focusing on the horn,
since that's what we really know.

2866
02:21:37,879 --> 02:21:40,966
It's pretty much the only thing
we know what it looks like.

2867
02:21:40,966 --> 02:21:43,033
MATT: Okay.
So, as you draw the circle

2868
02:21:43,033 --> 02:21:45,671
across the portion
of the gravel and stonework--

2869
02:21:45,671 --> 02:21:46,989
actually, this is further in the cave,

2870
02:21:46,989 --> 02:21:49,279
so the gravel has given in
to more solid stonework.

2871
02:21:49,279 --> 02:21:50,935
You begin to carve across the ground

2872
02:21:50,935 --> 02:21:53,135
with a small piece of charcoal
that you use for your ritual drawings,

2873
02:21:53,135 --> 02:21:55,886
this giant, runic circle.

2874
02:21:55,886 --> 02:21:57,183
You draw points for you to sit

2875
02:21:57,183 --> 02:21:59,832
and a point for Pike to sit as well,
to help you focus in this vision.

2876
02:21:59,832 --> 02:22:02,164
Once you've taken the ten minutes

2877
02:22:02,164 --> 02:22:04,159
to establish
all the various material components

2878
02:22:04,159 --> 02:22:07,920
and littered it with pieces
of dried animal matter, some herbs,

2879
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:11,978
and lit a small bowl of incense
on the side to help you in this spell,

2880
02:22:11,978 --> 02:22:14,815
you sit down, take your place.
Pike, you take your place.

2881
02:22:14,815 --> 02:22:17,327
And you begin to concentrate.

2882
02:22:17,327 --> 02:22:21,115
You draw the essence
of the nature energies around you

2883
02:22:21,115 --> 02:22:23,848
and begin to project your vision

2884
02:22:23,848 --> 02:22:25,975
towards the description
of this dark horn,

2885
02:22:25,975 --> 02:22:30,776
pushing what you can best ascertain
is the direction of the temple

2886
02:22:30,776 --> 02:22:34,087
from where this ritual
is being conducted.

2887
02:22:34,087 --> 02:22:38,437
All right, so. Given the circumstances...

2888
02:22:38,437 --> 02:22:41,777
bonus from that, let's make a will save.

2889
02:22:41,777 --> 02:22:46,471
All right. So.

2890
02:22:46,471 --> 02:22:50,581
You feel your vision project beyond you.

2891
02:22:50,581 --> 02:22:54,659
It's a sort of out-of-body experience
as the energy that makes up Keyleth

2892
02:22:54,659 --> 02:22:58,175
is no longer given physical form,
it's just adrift in the darkness.

2893
02:22:58,175 --> 02:23:01,270
You feel yourself drawn,
pulled almost,

2894
02:23:01,270 --> 02:23:03,904
like there's an energy that draws you
as if poison from a wound.

2895
02:23:03,904 --> 02:23:05,386
It pulls you upward,

2896
02:23:05,386 --> 02:23:07,270
and you're looking down over the top
of this entire cavern, suddenly.

2897
02:23:07,270 --> 02:23:09,670
The darkness tends to fade for a moment,

2898
02:23:09,670 --> 02:23:11,630
and you can make out
the general outline of this island.

2899
02:23:11,630 --> 02:23:14,185
Once again, your vision
(shhh) zooms in and shifts.

2900
02:23:14,185 --> 02:23:16,817
You can look over the city.
You can see Yug'Voril over top.

2901
02:23:16,817 --> 02:23:20,395
You can see
the glowing aspects of the forest

2902
02:23:20,395 --> 02:23:22,065
surrounding the outskirts of it.

2903
02:23:22,065 --> 02:23:25,343
And you can see in the center
of this ruined city

2904
02:23:25,343 --> 02:23:29,976
that has been reconstructed
in the image of the temple that stands.

2905
02:23:29,976 --> 02:23:32,973
This giant pseudo-pyramid
with a flattened top.

2906
02:23:32,973 --> 02:23:36,571
You can now see it
from the overhead view of this temple.

2907
02:23:36,571 --> 02:23:39,598
It is actually open,

2908
02:23:39,598 --> 02:23:42,000
and that strange glowing source
of green energy

2909
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,175
you can see
is slowly emanating from the top.

2910
02:23:44,175 --> 02:23:46,063
Your vision is pulled forward again.

2911
02:23:46,063 --> 02:23:47,520
You feel yourself drawn towards it,

2912
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:49,949
and as you come towards the top,
you can see:

2913
02:23:49,949 --> 02:23:55,213
the open portion of this temple's roof
is a crossbeam made of gold or brass,

2914
02:23:55,213 --> 02:23:58,738
and there is some sort of structure
hanging from it

2915
02:23:58,738 --> 02:24:01,815
that falls deeper into the temple.

2916
02:24:01,815 --> 02:24:03,810
You then move past this

2917
02:24:03,810 --> 02:24:06,775
into what is the topmost chamber
of this temple.

2918
02:24:06,775 --> 02:24:10,508
It's darker at first,
and as your essence tends to coalesce

2919
02:24:10,508 --> 02:24:13,682
and find some sort of visual here,
you can see now,

2920
02:24:13,682 --> 02:24:20,199
this brass cross-beam that is held aloft
in the center of this temple chamber

2921
02:24:20,199 --> 02:24:24,081
drips down into a spiral of metal,

2922
02:24:24,081 --> 02:24:27,581
this strange, arcane contraption

2923
02:24:27,581 --> 02:24:30,569
that does not match any of the construct
of this temple previously.

2924
02:24:30,569 --> 02:24:32,261
It almost seems like it's been
a new addition

2925
02:24:32,261 --> 02:24:37,884
or is taking the place of something else
that was a central focus of this chamber.

2926
02:24:37,884 --> 02:24:42,609
You follow this strange arcane structure.
About 15 to 20 feet it comes

2927
02:24:42,609 --> 02:24:45,837
from the top of the temple chamber
to the center,

2928
02:24:45,837 --> 02:24:48,733
where held aloft underneath it
by another 15-foot drop,

2929
02:24:48,733 --> 02:24:51,579
you see in this dark room

2930
02:24:51,579 --> 02:24:56,199
a pool of a dull, bluish purple liquid.

2931
02:24:56,199 --> 02:25:00,202
And it's pulsing with life,
and with energy.

2932
02:25:00,202 --> 02:25:01,995
You now look down, your eyes focus,

2933
02:25:01,995 --> 02:25:07,931
and in this pool, 
this ten, 15-foot-wide round pool,

2934
02:25:07,931 --> 02:25:12,684
you can see this pulse,
almost a heartbeat of purplish energy,

2935
02:25:12,684 --> 02:25:17,726
what look like small purple stones.

2936
02:25:17,726 --> 02:25:22,683
But they're not stones, they're minds.
They're brains. They're essences.

2937
02:25:22,683 --> 02:25:25,599
And they're all working together,
interconnected.

2938
02:25:25,599 --> 02:25:28,274
You're looking upon the Elder Brain
of Yug'Voril,

2939
02:25:28,274 --> 02:25:30,504
the center of the entire illithid colony

2940
02:25:30,504 --> 02:25:32,611
that resides
in the center of this chamber.

2941
02:25:32,611 --> 02:25:35,448
You can see now this green energy
that's being brought down

2942
02:25:35,448 --> 02:25:39,111
from this metallic structure
at the top of this temple

2943
02:25:39,111 --> 02:25:43,686
is being funneled down over,
and is acting as an arcane prison for,

2944
02:25:43,686 --> 02:25:45,472
the Elder Brain.

2945
02:25:45,472 --> 02:25:50,025
It's sealing and controlling, essentially,
and what you had gathered

2946
02:25:50,025 --> 02:25:53,169
from your previous discussions
with Clarota,

2947
02:25:53,169 --> 02:25:55,675
this is what has taken the minds
of the mind flayers

2948
02:25:55,675 --> 02:25:58,030
and bent them to K'Varn's will.

2949
02:25:58,030 --> 02:26:01,314
Your focus shifts now
from the Elder Brain,

2950
02:26:01,314 --> 02:26:03,845
and you look around the room,
and in the dark shadows of this room,

2951
02:26:03,845 --> 02:26:08,391
you can see there are cages.
There are metal bars.

2952
02:26:08,391 --> 02:26:11,612
You're unable to really ascertain
what the material is,

2953
02:26:11,612 --> 02:26:16,540
but in each one of these small cages
you see some creature.

2954
02:26:16,540 --> 02:26:17,922
Some of this realm, some not.

2955
02:26:17,922 --> 02:26:20,746
Horrible forms: mutated, torn,
some missing limbs,

2956
02:26:20,746 --> 02:26:23,837
some in the process of slowly dying

2957
02:26:23,837 --> 02:26:26,629
because they're unable
to keep a physical form intact.

2958
02:26:26,629 --> 02:26:30,145
It's a collection, a horrible collection

2959
02:26:30,145 --> 02:26:33,082
of malformed entities
that are being experimented on.

2960
02:26:33,082 --> 02:26:35,192
Pulled apart, put together.

2961
02:26:35,192 --> 02:26:39,307
This also serves as, seemingly,
a laboratory for K'Varn.

2962
02:26:39,307 --> 02:26:42,834
And you feel
a presence in the room, suddenly.

2963
02:26:42,834 --> 02:26:46,142
Your essence shifts around
and you look in the darkness

2964
02:26:46,142 --> 02:26:48,098
and you see,
slowly drifting out of the shadow,

2965
02:26:48,098 --> 02:26:52,378
a single gnarled black horn.

2966
02:26:52,378 --> 02:26:57,624
Underneath that horn, you can see now
the physical form that it adorns:

2967
02:26:57,624 --> 02:27:02,622
dark brown leathery skin
with slightly pointed edges,

2968
02:27:02,622 --> 02:27:05,284
almost like scales that form
out of portions of this flesh.

2969
02:27:05,284 --> 02:27:10,595
You see below this horn one large,
piercing, sky-blue eye

2970
02:27:10,595 --> 02:27:13,599
that glances up and meets your gaze.

2971
02:27:13,599 --> 02:27:15,473
As it does, from beneath that eye,

2972
02:27:15,473 --> 02:27:19,043
you see a toothy maw
tear into a wide grin.

2973
02:27:19,043 --> 02:27:22,484
And around the outskirts
of the singular eye,

2974
02:27:22,484 --> 02:27:25,811
numerous other eyes
(whoosh whoosh) shift around.

2975
02:27:25,811 --> 02:27:28,214
Coming into the light,
you see now a fleshy ball

2976
02:27:28,214 --> 02:27:32,230
that is drifting in the air itself
under its own physical form.

2977
02:27:32,230 --> 02:27:36,093
This aberration, this horrible entity
is now floating forward.

2978
02:27:36,093 --> 02:27:39,008
You can see metal plates that are grafted
to the physical body of this creature.

2979
02:27:39,008 --> 02:27:41,063
MARISHA: Oh, come on!

2980
02:27:41,063 --> 02:27:43,199
MATT: Apparently K'Varn
has experimented on itself.

2981
02:27:43,199 --> 02:27:46,244
These eyes are attached
to strange finger-like stalks

2982
02:27:46,244 --> 02:27:48,161
that twist out of its body.

2983
02:27:48,161 --> 02:27:51,113
These eyes, darting around the room,
looking at different directions,

2984
02:27:51,113 --> 02:27:54,228
and then they all (whoosh)
singularly shift on you at once.

2985
02:27:54,228 --> 02:27:56,771
As it does, you can feel,
all of a sudden, your presence,

2986
02:27:56,771 --> 02:27:58,702
which has been drifting
through the scrying spell,

2987
02:27:58,702 --> 02:27:59,784
locked in place.

2988
02:27:59,784 --> 02:28:03,609
And for a second,
you feel like you can't breathe.

2989
02:28:03,609 --> 02:28:06,798
As K'Varn presses towards you,

2990
02:28:06,798 --> 02:28:10,478
this fleshy sphere of eyestalks and teeth,

2991
02:28:10,478 --> 02:28:13,851
this small chuckle billows up
deep within its mouth.

2992
02:28:13,851 --> 02:28:19,089
"(chuckles) So, guest.

2993
02:28:19,089 --> 02:28:22,089
"Do you like my home?

2994
02:28:22,089 --> 02:28:25,014
"You're welcome any time."

2995
02:28:25,014 --> 02:28:29,709
At which point, the horn seems to glow
with this creepy greenish energy,

2996
02:28:29,709 --> 02:28:33,950
and you feel this piercing pain
blast into your head.

2997
02:28:33,950 --> 02:28:37,198
You try and scream, but you can't.
There's no breath.

2998
02:28:37,198 --> 02:28:39,644
Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.

2999
02:28:39,644 --> 02:28:42,244
LAURA: Oh no!
SAM: Oh, shit. Oh god.

3000
02:28:42,244 --> 02:28:46,957
MARISHA: Do I still
have my Enhance Ability up?

3001
02:28:46,957 --> 02:28:48,732
MATT: No,
because that's a concentration spell.

3002
02:28:48,732 --> 02:28:50,887
LIAM: What does Keyleth look like
to us right now?

3003
02:28:50,887 --> 02:28:54,066
MATT: Keyleth is sweating profusely,
and you can see she's flinching.

3004
02:28:54,066 --> 02:28:55,867
LIAM: I'm walking up to Keyleth
and I'm grabbing her by the shirt

3005
02:28:55,867 --> 02:28:58,195
and I'm going to slap her
across the face.

3006
02:28:58,195 --> 02:28:59,068
MATT: All right. So?

3007
02:28:59,068 --> 02:29:01,542
MARISHA: 27.

3008
02:29:01,542 --> 02:29:03,769
MATT: 27. All right. Good.

3009
02:29:03,769 --> 02:29:08,084
You take 11 points of psychic damage
and are thrust out of the scry spell.

3010
02:29:08,084 --> 02:29:10,896
Your vision is pulled
out of the top of the temple

3011
02:29:10,896 --> 02:29:13,362
and suddenly you're back in your form

3012
02:29:13,362 --> 02:29:17,372
as a sharp pain
hits you across the side of the head.

3013
02:29:17,372 --> 02:29:19,213
MARISHA: Ow!

3014
02:29:19,213 --> 02:29:20,630
MATT: Vax is holding you.

3015
02:29:20,630 --> 02:29:23,127
MARISHA: Christ! What-- why?!

3016
02:29:23,127 --> 02:29:25,530
LIAM: You were in pain.
Are you all right?

3017
02:29:25,530 --> 02:29:27,088
Are you all right?

3018
02:29:27,088 --> 02:29:29,458
MARISHA: "You were in pain,

3019
02:29:29,458 --> 02:29:32,362
"so I thought I'd fucking
slap you across the face?" Gee!

3020
02:29:32,362 --> 02:29:34,607
LAURA: Keyleth! Language.
TRAVIS: Are we hitting each other now?

3021
02:29:34,607 --> 02:29:39,160
MARISHA: Sorry. Wow.

3022
02:29:39,160 --> 02:29:43,082
ORION AND LAURA: What did you see?

3023
02:29:43,082 --> 02:29:45,211
ORION: So she tells us, right?

3024
02:29:45,211 --> 02:29:47,822
MARISHA: K'Varn's a beholder.

3025
02:29:47,822 --> 02:29:50,276
LAURA: (gasps)
SAM: A beholder? What's that?

3026
02:29:50,276 --> 02:29:52,495
ORION: It is really
not a thing we want to fight.

3027
02:29:52,495 --> 02:29:55,921
It is awful. It is wretched.
It will kill all of us

3028
02:29:55,921 --> 02:29:58,974
if we don't find out a way
to kill it-- oh my god.

3029
02:29:58,974 --> 02:30:03,606
MARISHA: Not only is K'Varn a beholder,
K'Varn has been experimenting on himself

3030
02:30:03,606 --> 02:30:08,336
and so he has armor grafted onto him,

3031
02:30:08,336 --> 02:30:11,486
and the horn

3032
02:30:11,486 --> 02:30:16,355
The horn which-- I don't know.

3033
02:30:16,355 --> 02:30:20,052
LAURA: You said there is something
caging the Elder Brain right?

3034
02:30:20,052 --> 02:30:22,903
MARISHA: Yes. That big green light.

3035
02:30:22,903 --> 02:30:26,105
Can, we can see it?
Is it like the Luxor in Vegas?

3036
02:30:26,105 --> 02:30:27,636
Can we see the green light?

3037
02:30:27,636 --> 02:30:30,145
MATT: It's not a beam,
but you do see a slight green glow

3038
02:30:30,145 --> 02:30:32,118
at the top of the temple
in the distance.

3039
02:30:32,118 --> 02:30:33,437
You saw it when you first entered,

3040
02:30:33,437 --> 02:30:36,005
and it's been this dull beacon
as you traveled around this island.

3041
02:30:36,005 --> 02:30:38,748
LAURA: So there's something connected
to the top of the temple

3042
02:30:38,748 --> 02:30:40,563
that's caging the Elder Brain?

3043
02:30:40,563 --> 02:30:44,629
MARISHA: It's like an arcane prison
around all of the Elder Brain.

3044
02:30:44,629 --> 02:30:46,878
LAURA: Is it possible

3045
02:30:46,878 --> 02:30:51,417
to maybe collapse the top of the temple
from far away,

3046
02:30:51,417 --> 02:30:54,821
and release the Elder Brain
from its cage

3047
02:30:54,821 --> 02:30:58,139
and then Clarota,
your brethren could fight the beholder

3048
02:30:58,139 --> 02:31:00,755
instead of us? (laughs)

3049
02:31:00,755 --> 02:31:04,194
MARISHA: Clarota, do you know
how we could possibly break this prison?

3050
02:31:04,194 --> 02:31:05,834
TRAVIS: Could you tell me
what a beholder is first?

3051
02:31:05,834 --> 02:31:07,966
Because I don't know.

3052
02:31:07,966 --> 02:31:09,939
SAM: Big bad scary thing.

3053
02:31:09,939 --> 02:31:12,915
TRAVIS: With finger eyes?

3054
02:31:12,915 --> 02:31:15,552
ORION: DM, I write a detailed--

3055
02:31:15,552 --> 02:31:18,149
SAM: Just hold on. Wait. Patience.

3056
02:31:18,149 --> 02:31:19,455
MATT: That's a beholder.

3057
02:31:19,455 --> 02:31:22,603
LAURA: Oh, the thing
on the front of the Monster Manual.

3058
02:31:22,603 --> 02:31:24,697
ASHLEY: It's on the cover of a book.

3059
02:31:24,697 --> 02:31:26,612
TRAVIS: Worst possible scenario
imaginable.

3060
02:31:26,612 --> 02:31:30,161
LAURA: That's all you could have said.
LIAM: The iconic creature.

3061
02:31:30,161 --> 02:31:32,783
TALIESIN: It's on the cover
of Dungeons &amp; Dragons Monthly right now.

3062
02:31:32,783 --> 02:31:35,200
It is the cover model.

3063
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:38,348
LIAM: There's dragon, then beholder.
MARISHA: Oh, man.

3064
02:31:38,348 --> 02:31:39,550
LAURA: I mean, we've killed a dragon.

3065
02:31:39,550 --> 02:31:41,881
TRAVIS: Yeah he's got lots of teeth.
Let's brush 'em.

3066
02:31:41,881 --> 02:31:48,427
MARISHA: Each eye tends to have a beam
that has a different ability.

3067
02:31:48,427 --> 02:31:49,677
SAM: Yes.
LAURA: Oh.

3068
02:31:49,677 --> 02:31:51,974
LIAM: It's a magic fun bag.

3069
02:31:51,974 --> 02:31:55,488
MARISHA: It's a magic fun bag.
It's probably got everything

3070
02:31:55,488 --> 02:31:58,854
from Silence and Dispel Magic

3071
02:31:58,854 --> 02:32:01,884
to Petrify to a disintegration ray.

3072
02:32:01,884 --> 02:32:03,985
TALIESIN: You're thinking
about this wrong, though.

3073
02:32:03,985 --> 02:32:06,543
You're thinking about this
in the wrong direction.

3074
02:32:06,543 --> 02:32:11,877
Beholder is not--
that's not the goal.

3075
02:32:11,877 --> 02:32:13,791
LAURA: The horn is the goal.

3076
02:32:13,791 --> 02:32:17,864
TALIESIN: Even more than that,
it's the hundreds of allies we could have.

3077
02:32:17,864 --> 02:32:20,730
LAURA: Exactly! We free the Elder Brain,
they attack it.

3078
02:32:20,730 --> 02:32:22,745
TALIESIN: Prison is the target.

3079
02:32:22,745 --> 02:32:24,238
TRAVIS: Not the beholder?

3080
02:32:24,238 --> 02:32:28,978
TALIESIN: Not the beholder.
If we can free the Elder Brain--

3081
02:32:28,978 --> 02:32:30,773
LAURA: We don't 
have to fight it ourselves.

3082
02:32:30,773 --> 02:32:32,297
TALIESIN: Then we're not alone.

3083
02:32:32,297 --> 02:32:37,010
Now, what was creating this green light?
Where was it emanating from?

3084
02:32:37,010 --> 02:32:42,368
MARISHA: It seemed to be emanating
from the top opening of this pyramid

3085
02:32:42,368 --> 02:32:44,906
that was the main temple
of the center of town.

3086
02:32:44,906 --> 02:32:47,516
TALIESIN: Can you describe
the top of the pyramid?

3087
02:32:47,516 --> 02:32:48,891
MATT: I'll give you
a detailed description.

3088
02:32:48,891 --> 02:32:50,400
Essentially,
this pyramid comes to a top

3089
02:32:50,400 --> 02:32:52,444
and then flattens up at the very top.

3090
02:32:52,444 --> 02:32:54,595
Where you would expect there
to be a flat surface

3091
02:32:54,595 --> 02:32:56,253
is instead, essentially,
a windowed opening.

3092
02:32:56,253 --> 02:33:00,100
You don't think it's purely open
like you could just jump through.

3093
02:33:00,100 --> 02:33:01,302
There is some sort of glass
that coats it,

3094
02:33:01,302 --> 02:33:04,232
but there is a brass cross-beam
at the very top,

3095
02:33:04,232 --> 02:33:06,272
and then part of this cross-beam

3096
02:33:06,272 --> 02:33:09,505
holds aloft this strange series
of metallic wires

3097
02:33:09,505 --> 02:33:13,644
that spiral and intertwine
that serves as a conical focus piece.

3098
02:33:13,644 --> 02:33:15,734
You can't see the interior of it.

3099
02:33:15,734 --> 02:33:17,084
LAURA: So if we take out the beams--

3100
02:33:17,084 --> 02:33:19,073
MARISHA: It was almost like a beehive.

3101
02:33:19,073 --> 02:33:20,546
MATT: Essentially a slow beehive.

3102
02:33:20,546 --> 02:33:23,443
MARISHA: It was focusing the energy.

3103
02:33:23,443 --> 02:33:26,585
TALIESIN: We have
something very important.

3104
02:33:26,585 --> 02:33:29,329
We have a vial of yellow liquid.

3105
02:33:29,329 --> 02:33:30,455
SAM: What does it do?

3106
02:33:30,455 --> 02:33:31,932
LAURA: It might age you.

3107
02:33:31,932 --> 02:33:33,709
MARISHA: We don't know.
LAURA: It might do something.

3108
02:33:33,709 --> 02:33:35,221
TALIESIN: It seems to be very acidic.

3109
02:33:35,221 --> 02:33:37,679
SAM: So it could burn the metal?
ASHLEY: Burn the beams?

3110
02:33:37,679 --> 02:33:38,924
TALIESIN: I could melt the metal

3111
02:33:38,924 --> 02:33:42,001
and we could actually
bring that entire structure crashing down.

3112
02:33:42,001 --> 02:33:43,421
LAURA: But does anybody
have an aging spell?

3113
02:33:43,421 --> 02:33:45,570
Something that causes things
to disintegrate things?

3114
02:33:45,570 --> 02:33:49,141
Maybe we could rust the metal as well?

3115
02:33:49,141 --> 02:33:52,511
TALIESIN: We have that yellow goop,
and that would definitely help.

3116
02:33:52,511 --> 02:33:54,071
LIAM: We know that it's acid?

3117
02:33:54,071 --> 02:33:56,130
TALIESIN: We suspect it.

3118
02:33:56,130 --> 02:33:58,060
LAURA: It might be a form changer,

3119
02:33:58,060 --> 02:34:02,026
because the king swallowed a vial
and it made him strong.

3120
02:34:02,026 --> 02:34:06,032
MARISHA: Actually, I can learn Heat Metal

3121
02:34:06,032 --> 02:34:09,974
and I can heat the beam
and make it (clicks her tongue) beam.

3122
02:34:09,974 --> 02:34:12,534
LAURA: He's got vials of acid
in his Bag of Holding.

3123
02:34:12,534 --> 02:34:14,386
ASHLEY: Excellent.

3124
02:34:14,386 --> 02:34:16,405
TALIESIN: We're going to break the temple.

3125
02:34:16,405 --> 02:34:18,370
LAURA: Let's break the temple. Clarota?

3126
02:34:18,370 --> 02:34:20,695
MATT: At this point,
as you guys look over at Clarota,

3127
02:34:20,695 --> 02:34:23,269
you see Clarota,
for the first time in a while,

3128
02:34:23,269 --> 02:34:25,169
looks visually disturbed.

3129
02:34:25,169 --> 02:34:28,261
Has withdrawn from the group

3130
02:34:28,261 --> 02:34:31,581
and is leaning against the side
of the beach cavern wall

3131
02:34:31,581 --> 02:34:34,055
and the tentacles
that normally slowly twirl

3132
02:34:34,055 --> 02:34:36,575
are all tensed
and pulled up into a knot.

3133
02:34:36,575 --> 02:34:39,728
LAURA: Clarota, you're going to cramp 
your face if you do that.

3134
02:34:39,728 --> 02:34:42,063
TALIESIN: If you have something to say,
we would appreciate it.

3135
02:34:42,063 --> 02:34:45,238
LIAM: If you keep making that face,
it'll freeze that way.

3136
02:34:45,238 --> 02:34:50,517
MATT: "That K'Varn is

3137
02:34:50,517 --> 02:34:55,077
"of this new creature, a beholder,

3138
02:34:55,077 --> 02:35:01,268
"and carries this horn
that Lady Kima has spoken of.

3139
02:35:01,268 --> 02:35:06,133
"It's a great danger.
Also, keep in mind

3140
02:35:06,133 --> 02:35:11,590
"the temple is not made
of average stolen metals.

3141
02:35:11,590 --> 02:35:17,223
"This is the center of the Elder Brain.
We reinforce it with magical protection.

3142
02:35:17,223 --> 02:35:20,791
"It's the center
of our entire species' knowledge.

3143
02:35:20,791 --> 02:35:26,429
"Every brain in there is our elders'.
As we pass to the next generation,

3144
02:35:26,429 --> 02:35:32,502
"our mind is brought and introduced
to the Elder Brain.

3145
02:35:32,502 --> 02:35:37,072
"We have that room protected
from simple acids.

3146
02:35:37,072 --> 02:35:41,257
"We must make sure we are ready."

3147
02:35:41,257 --> 02:35:45,549
LIAM: Clarota, Keyleth has scried
the top of the building right now.

3148
02:35:45,549 --> 02:35:49,344
It didn't look like it was part
of the original structure.

3149
02:35:49,344 --> 02:35:53,964
Is she mistaken? Is the top something
that was built by your people?

3150
02:35:53,964 --> 02:35:56,502
MATT: "No. It was open before.

3151
02:35:56,502 --> 02:36:01,968
"There seems to be some sort
of new focus K'Varn has constructed."

3152
02:36:01,968 --> 02:36:04,918
LIAM: Would that be as strong
as the rest of the building?

3153
02:36:04,918 --> 02:36:08,586
MATT: "I do not know.

3154
02:36:08,586 --> 02:36:13,822
"But if I've seen anything
of the nature of this insidious creature,

3155
02:36:13,822 --> 02:36:18,546
"I would say, plan for the worst.

3156
02:36:18,546 --> 02:36:23,333
"Nothing is more terrifying

3157
02:36:23,333 --> 02:36:26,333
"than underestimating a beholder."

3158
02:36:26,333 --> 02:36:31,431
LAURA: Right. Can beholders fly?
MARISHA: Yeah.

3159
02:36:31,431 --> 02:36:33,446
LAURA: They can. Okay.

3160
02:36:33,446 --> 02:36:37,948
TRAVIS: Among other things,
it seems like.

3161
02:36:37,948 --> 02:36:40,917
LAURA: What can't they do?
LIAM: Not much.

3162
02:36:40,917 --> 02:36:43,049
TALIESIN: They're terrible monsters.

3163
02:36:43,049 --> 02:36:45,299
LAURA: So they're really
very fleshy and weak,

3164
02:36:45,299 --> 02:36:46,529
but he put armor on himself.

3165
02:36:46,529 --> 02:36:47,886
TRAVIS: He's super strong.
LAURA: So now he's extra strong.

3166
02:36:47,886 --> 02:36:49,548
LIAM: Like a wizard times 50.

3167
02:36:49,548 --> 02:36:51,879
MARISHA: I'm assuming-- oh, go ahead.

3168
02:36:51,879 --> 02:36:53,170
MATT: Then Kima says,

3169
02:36:53,170 --> 02:36:58,680
"The key is here is not to think
how to fight him head-on.

3170
02:36:58,680 --> 02:37:00,524
"We have to be smart about this.

3171
02:37:00,524 --> 02:37:05,861
"While he has the home turf,
we have the element of surprise.

3172
02:37:05,861 --> 02:37:07,613
"We choose the grounds
in which we attack,

3173
02:37:07,613 --> 02:37:11,515
"and we choose the methods
in which we set the battlefield."

3174
02:37:11,515 --> 02:37:12,750
MARISHA: Underwater fight!

3175
02:37:12,750 --> 02:37:16,224
SAM: We could try
to just draw him out somehow.

3176
02:37:16,224 --> 02:37:18,174
MATT: "I highly doubt
he's going to leave his home turf.

3177
02:37:18,174 --> 02:37:22,073
"But if we can find a way
to perhaps turn it against him

3178
02:37:22,073 --> 02:37:23,370
"or use it to our advantage.

3179
02:37:23,370 --> 02:37:26,053
"Maybe some reconnaissance.
I don't know."

3180
02:37:26,053 --> 02:37:27,162
LAURA: Reconnaissance!

3181
02:37:27,162 --> 02:37:28,572
MATT: "I don't know!"

3182
02:37:28,572 --> 02:37:31,395
TRAVIS: It is glass on the top,
so we could try to Sunlight the head?

3183
02:37:31,395 --> 02:37:36,929
ASHLEY: I have something
called Divine Intervention.

3184
02:37:36,929 --> 02:37:41,055
LAURA: What is that?

3185
02:37:41,055 --> 02:37:44,578
ASHLEY: You can call on your deity,

3186
02:37:44,578 --> 02:37:48,568
and you roll a percentile die,

3187
02:37:48,568 --> 02:37:50,939
and you can have them help you
with something.

3188
02:37:50,939 --> 02:37:52,050
LAURA: So is it possible

3189
02:37:52,050 --> 02:37:53,603
to try to get her help
before we do this?

3190
02:37:53,603 --> 02:37:55,246
Or is it something
that you have to do on the spot?

3191
02:37:55,246 --> 02:37:59,427
ASHLEY: I don't know, because this is new.

3192
02:37:59,427 --> 02:38:01,790
MATT: That's up to you.
You can attempt it once a day,

3193
02:38:01,790 --> 02:38:03,952
and once it works,
it can't be done for another week.

3194
02:38:03,952 --> 02:38:05,863
LAURA: So if we attempt it,
then she can intervene?

3195
02:38:05,863 --> 02:38:07,029
She can be on our side?

3196
02:38:07,029 --> 02:38:08,121
MATT: In some way.

3197
02:38:08,121 --> 02:38:11,554
Essentially, you formulate
how you want your deity's aid.

3198
02:38:11,554 --> 02:38:14,777
And if you succeed--
you have a 10% chance of success--

3199
02:38:14,777 --> 02:38:18,428
in some divine way,

3200
02:38:18,428 --> 02:38:23,048
Sarenrae will guide power or aid to you.

3201
02:38:23,048 --> 02:38:25,156
SAM: Why don't you wait on that.

3202
02:38:25,156 --> 02:38:26,817
LIAM: Well, we either have

3203
02:38:26,817 --> 02:38:29,504
a 10% chance right now for her
to tell us what to do--

3204
02:38:29,504 --> 02:38:32,358
LIAM: Or a 10% chance--
SAM: To help us later.

3205
02:38:32,358 --> 02:38:35,003
LAURA: Once we know
what we're doing.

3206
02:38:35,003 --> 02:38:37,459
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's wait
until we know what we're doing.

3207
02:38:37,459 --> 02:38:39,991
ORION: I believe we should go
and rescue the prisoners

3208
02:38:39,991 --> 02:38:42,381
and build a small army.

3209
02:38:42,386 --> 02:38:44,605
Moreover, I've been thinking.

3210
02:38:44,605 --> 02:38:48,928
It all goes downward, correct?
He's all up in a pit, yes?

3211
02:38:48,928 --> 02:38:50,355
SAM: The world down here?

3212
02:38:50,355 --> 02:38:53,208
ORION: No, the beholder, K'Varn.

3213
02:38:53,208 --> 02:38:55,331
LIAM: He's in the top of a pyramid.

3214
02:38:55,331 --> 02:38:57,178
ORION: Up or down?
LIAM AND TRAVIS: Up.

3215
02:38:57,178 --> 02:38:59,718
ORION: Well, that won't
help me at all.

3216
02:38:59,718 --> 02:39:01,920
MARISHA: It's his laboratory.

3217
02:39:01,920 --> 02:39:03,825
LAURA: I feel like we should go
for the top.

3218
02:39:03,825 --> 02:39:06,052
TRAVIS: How would we free the prisoners,
first of all?

3219
02:39:06,052 --> 02:39:09,076
TALIESIN: I think it's
that beehive structure.

3220
02:39:09,076 --> 02:39:11,985
LAURA: We have to take out
the metal thingy.

3221
02:39:11,985 --> 02:39:13,276
LIAM: It's not letting them out.

3222
02:39:13,276 --> 02:39:16,218
We have to get them
out of K'Varn's control.

3223
02:39:16,218 --> 02:39:17,609
So how do we do that?

3224
02:39:17,609 --> 02:39:19,129
TALIESIN: I think we destroy
the beehive structure at the top.

3225
02:39:19,129 --> 02:39:21,902
LAURA: I think we destroy the structure.

3226
02:39:21,902 --> 02:39:23,923
LIAM: It's the only option
that seems open to us,

3227
02:39:23,923 --> 02:39:26,906
unless we keep stumbling around
and looking for some other way, I think.

3228
02:39:26,906 --> 02:39:28,393
LAURA: We don't have
any kind of corruption spell

3229
02:39:28,393 --> 02:39:29,825
that ages things?

3230
02:39:29,825 --> 02:39:32,613
MARISHA: Well, we've got the acid thing,
and maybe Grog can--

3231
02:39:32,613 --> 02:39:35,475
LAURA: What if we hit it
with Dispel Magic,

3232
02:39:35,475 --> 02:39:38,905
maybe get your goddess's aid--

3233
02:39:38,905 --> 02:39:41,600
hit it with Dispel Magic,
hit it with corruption,

3234
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:45,082
rust the shit, and then it falls!

3235
02:39:45,082 --> 02:39:46,662
SAM: But we don't have corruption.

3236
02:39:46,662 --> 02:39:50,801
LIAM: Can Scanlan mercilessly mock
the top of the thing?

3237
02:39:50,801 --> 02:39:55,046
SAM: Oh, I can mock.
TRAVIS: Eff you, brass cross!

3238
02:39:55,046 --> 02:40:00,688
MARISHA: I like Percy's idea.
We've got that acidic vial.

3239
02:40:00,688 --> 02:40:05,401
TALIESIN: We have several
vials of acid, actually.

3240
02:40:05,401 --> 02:40:09,409
ASHLEY: Can you take the normal acid
and could we make it magical?

3241
02:40:09,409 --> 02:40:12,986
LAURA: Like, extra bad?
We don't even know what it does yet.

3242
02:40:12,986 --> 02:40:19,141
MARISHA: Well, I can always be an eagle,
and I can maybe fly,

3243
02:40:19,141 --> 02:40:23,891
or maybe Grog could carry a big boulder.

3244
02:40:23,891 --> 02:40:26,438
That way, after the acid has--

3245
02:40:26,440 --> 02:40:29,096
TALIESIN: I thought about
making an acid arrow. I really did.

3246
02:40:29,098 --> 02:40:32,077
MARISHA: He could throw a big boulder
to collapse it the rest of the way.

3247
02:40:32,077 --> 02:40:35,172
LIAM: Question. You built a bomb before.
SAM: That took months.

3248
02:40:35,172 --> 02:40:37,235
LIAM: If we could hole up for--
months or weeks, was it?

3249
02:40:37,235 --> 02:40:38,957
LAURA AND SAM: Months.
TRAVIS: Yeah, it took months.

3250
02:40:38,957 --> 02:40:41,054
TALIESIN: It took me months
to figure out how to build.

3251
02:40:41,054 --> 02:40:43,536
LIAM: Now that you know how to build one,
would it be quicker?

3252
02:40:43,536 --> 02:40:45,316
MARISHA: Wait,
the bomb we just threw in that room?

3253
02:40:45,316 --> 02:40:47,889
TALIESIN: I could make
an exploding arrow.

3254
02:40:47,889 --> 02:40:49,869
I've made one, I can make another.

3255
02:40:49,869 --> 02:40:52,299
MATT: I would say your materials
are very limited.

3256
02:40:52,299 --> 02:40:56,005
TALIESIN: Yeah. At this point, though,
if I had a workshop, I could--

3257
02:40:56,005 --> 02:40:57,528
SAM: Well, let's take Kima's advice

3258
02:40:57,528 --> 02:40:59,963
and maybe start
with a little reconnaissance.

3259
02:40:59,963 --> 02:41:01,955
We'll get closer,
we'll rest for the night,

3260
02:41:01,955 --> 02:41:04,386
and maybe send in a snooping party.

3261
02:41:04,386 --> 02:41:08,134
LIAM: My sister says
that island is crawling with nasty shits.

3262
02:41:08,134 --> 02:41:09,575
LAURA: We can't get closer.

3263
02:41:09,575 --> 02:41:14,032
ASHLEY: We should just rest.
We'll stay up, because we're good.

3264
02:41:14,032 --> 02:41:20,756
LAURA: What if we fly in over the top
with the carpet in stealth,

3265
02:41:20,756 --> 02:41:26,481
put the camouflage on the carpet
so they don't see it.

3266
02:41:26,481 --> 02:41:31,145
Fly in over the top.
Stealth in, spy, get an idea of--

3267
02:41:31,145 --> 02:41:32,286
LIAM: Inspect the top of the building,

3268
02:41:32,286 --> 02:41:34,899
see where the acid
would be put to good use.

3269
02:41:34,899 --> 02:41:40,167
LAURA: Yeah, see what kind of magic
is being held on top of it.

3270
02:41:40,167 --> 02:41:41,670
LIAM: We're guessing

3271
02:41:41,670 --> 02:41:43,624
that K'Varn doesn't want to leave
his little cubby-hole.

3272
02:41:43,624 --> 02:41:45,007
TALIESIN: I would assume not.

3273
02:41:45,007 --> 02:41:49,266
LIAM: So even if we fly down on top,
he gets pissed, he could fly up,

3274
02:41:49,266 --> 02:41:50,260
but we could fly away.

3275
02:41:50,260 --> 02:41:52,534
He probably doesn't want to leave
the top of the--

3276
02:41:52,534 --> 02:41:54,400
TALIESIN: There's going to come a point

3277
02:41:54,400 --> 02:41:56,363
where chaos
is just going to descend on us.

3278
02:41:56,363 --> 02:41:57,972
TRAVIS: We're also forgetting

3279
02:41:57,972 --> 02:42:00,007
that the second that he sees us
or we get close enough,

3280
02:42:00,007 --> 02:42:02,039
he could control all of our minds.

3281
02:42:02,039 --> 02:42:06,033
SAM: Wasn't the point of us going
to these beaches

3282
02:42:06,033 --> 02:42:09,877
to try to see if there
was any other advantage we could find?

3283
02:42:09,877 --> 02:42:11,299
LAURA: We were trying to find clues

3284
02:42:11,299 --> 02:42:13,728
so that maybe scrying
would be helpful, which it was.

3285
02:42:13,728 --> 02:42:15,153
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: All right.

3286
02:42:15,153 --> 02:42:19,505
LAURA: Okay, here's another option:
Dimension Door.

3287
02:42:19,505 --> 02:42:22,259
What if you go and hug one of the beams
and Dimension Door the beam out?

3288
02:42:22,259 --> 02:42:24,539
SAM: I don't think I can do that.
ORION: No.

3289
02:42:24,539 --> 02:42:28,008
SAM: I can banish a being,
but not a beam.

3290
02:42:28,008 --> 02:42:31,360
LAURA: You can't cast a portal
on the door and make it fall?

3291
02:42:31,360 --> 02:42:32,851
TALIESIN: No, sadly.
LAURA: Not like Portal?

3292
02:42:32,851 --> 02:42:37,975
LIAM: Well, we've been here,
and we've been here.

3293
02:42:37,975 --> 02:42:40,874
SAM: Should we go to one more beach
before we all die?

3294
02:42:40,874 --> 02:42:43,422
LIAM: Here, or here,
or this little nubbin right here?

3295
02:42:43,422 --> 02:42:44,970
TALIESIN: I was thinking about that.

3296
02:42:44,970 --> 02:42:46,684
LAURA: Those are just
more things to fight.

3297
02:42:46,684 --> 02:42:52,772
LIAM: Well, that's true,
but my sister studied the island,

3298
02:42:52,772 --> 02:42:56,967
and she sensed
the presence of things everywhere.

3299
02:42:56,967 --> 02:42:59,211
TRAVIS: That sounds awesome.
Let's go there.

3300
02:42:59,211 --> 02:43:01,051
MATT: Clustered mainly
in the city region.

3301
02:43:01,051 --> 02:43:02,967
MARISHA: There's no need 
for us to relocate now.

3302
02:43:02,967 --> 02:43:05,926
LIAM: Well I am curious about this.

3303
02:43:05,926 --> 02:43:07,892
Can we see this from the beach we're on?
What is this?

3304
02:43:07,892 --> 02:43:09,121
MATT: At this distance,

3305
02:43:09,121 --> 02:43:12,464
it's hard to make out
any sort of visual.

3306
02:43:12,464 --> 02:43:14,566
TALIESIN: We could camp there.

3307
02:43:14,566 --> 02:43:17,006
That could be where
we stage our attack from.

3308
02:43:17,006 --> 02:43:18,690
TRAVIS: Yeah, I like that.
Let's go take over a little shanty-town.

3309
02:43:18,690 --> 02:43:19,758
MARISHA: Wait. Why?

3310
02:43:19,758 --> 02:43:22,093
SAM: Because it'll be
that much closer tomorrow.

3311
02:43:22,093 --> 02:43:24,886
We can do reconnaissance from there.

3312
02:43:24,886 --> 02:43:27,076
MARISHA: We can do reconnaissance
from where we are.

3313
02:43:27,076 --> 02:43:29,119
SAM: We still have to get across
this body of water.

3314
02:43:29,119 --> 02:43:31,077
You said
there's something swimming down there.

3315
02:43:31,077 --> 02:43:33,024
MARISHA: We've got a magic carpet.

3316
02:43:33,024 --> 02:43:34,699
TRAVIS: It'll be a little victory.
We'll take over the shanty-town.

3317
02:43:34,699 --> 02:43:36,447
MARISHA: It's literally
never been a problem.

3318
02:43:36,447 --> 02:43:37,797
ASHLEY: Can we all fit
on the magic carpet?

3319
02:43:37,797 --> 02:43:39,429
LAURA AND TRAVIS: No.
MATT: Not at once, no.

3320
02:43:39,429 --> 02:43:41,488
ASHLEY: I can water-walk.

3321
02:43:41,488 --> 02:43:43,440
LIAM: We can also
do two trips on the carpet.

3322
02:43:43,440 --> 02:43:45,767
MARISHA: But we're not all going
for reconnaissance, are we?

3323
02:43:45,767 --> 02:43:47,965
LAURA: No, stealthy stealth.

3324
02:43:47,965 --> 02:43:50,495
TALIESIN: If something goes wrong,
though, it's going to be--

3325
02:43:50,495 --> 02:43:53,340
I would rather something go wrong
with all of us

3326
02:43:53,340 --> 02:43:55,302
than something go wrong
with half of us.

3327
02:43:55,302 --> 02:43:57,927
LIAM: Well, I tell you what.
We don't know what to do,

3328
02:43:57,927 --> 02:44:00,522
so why don't Vex and I and Scanlan

3329
02:44:00,522 --> 02:44:03,126
go for a little ride
and check out the tip of this island?

3330
02:44:03,126 --> 02:44:04,994
ASHLEY: I don't want to be split up.
TRAVIS: I don't, either.

3331
02:44:04,994 --> 02:44:08,314
TRAVIS: Let's take over the shanty-town.
Let's at least get on the island.

3332
02:44:08,314 --> 02:44:09,858
SAM AND TALIESIN: Baby steps.

3333
02:44:09,858 --> 02:44:11,896
TRAVIS: Yeah, baby steps.

3334
02:44:11,896 --> 02:44:15,209
MARISHA: Okay, well, then you guys
go check it out first.

3335
02:44:15,209 --> 02:44:17,487
TALIESIN: We'll get in the boat
and we'll start heading there.

3336
02:44:17,487 --> 02:44:19,326
ASHLEY: Are we getting on the boat
or doing the carpet?

3337
02:44:19,326 --> 02:44:20,490
TALIESIN: Well, we can't
all fit on the carpet.

3338
02:44:20,490 --> 02:44:24,460
LIAM: Let's let Tiberius
and the twins and Scanlan

3339
02:44:24,460 --> 02:44:28,953
fly ahead of the boat,
quietly, carefully, see what we see.

3340
02:44:28,953 --> 02:44:32,267
We have the earrings
that Tibber-hoods crafted for us,

3341
02:44:32,267 --> 02:44:33,816
so we can tell you what we see.

3342
02:44:33,816 --> 02:44:34,923
TALIESIN: Perfect.

3343
02:44:34,923 --> 02:44:38,320
LIAM: And we don't want to rush in.

3344
02:44:38,320 --> 02:44:40,590
We're probably going to go here,
but let's not rush in.

3345
02:44:40,590 --> 02:44:42,691
Let the quiet ones go have a look.

3346
02:44:42,691 --> 02:44:44,071
LAURA: Just to make sure
it's not crawling with baddies.

3347
02:44:44,071 --> 02:44:46,736
MARISHA: Okay.
So we'll start boating over.

3348
02:44:46,736 --> 02:44:48,683
LIAM: You need to take it easy
for a moment.

3349
02:44:48,683 --> 02:44:49,907
You just went through some shit, Keyleth.

3350
02:44:49,907 --> 02:44:52,130
ASHLEY: You guys are going on the carpet?
LAURA: Yeah.

3351
02:44:52,130 --> 02:44:53,426
MARISHA: Yeah,
I'm going to take the boat.

3352
02:44:53,426 --> 02:44:56,011
TRAVIS: I've got a big axe.
I'll paddle the boat towards the island.

3353
02:44:56,011 --> 02:44:56,987
MARISHA: Awesome.

3354
02:44:56,987 --> 02:44:59,526
TRAVIS: I've been practicing
in the sand to impress Keyleth.

3355
02:44:59,526 --> 02:45:02,119
Working on the elevator.

3356
02:45:02,119 --> 02:45:04,501
I haven't figured it out yet,
because I don't know what that is.

3357
02:45:04,501 --> 02:45:07,046
LIAM: You know that thing a dog does
when it pulls its butt along the floor?

3358
02:45:07,046 --> 02:45:09,279
LAURA: But I could cast
Pass Without a Trace

3359
02:45:09,279 --> 02:45:14,103
so everybody gets +10
to their stealth rolls.

3360
02:45:14,103 --> 02:45:15,536
LIAM: Yeah, that sounds good.

3361
02:45:15,536 --> 02:45:16,869
TRAVIS: So who's in the boat with me?

3362
02:45:16,869 --> 02:45:19,913
SAM: Oh, we're going over?
By boat? Is that what's happening?

3363
02:45:19,913 --> 02:45:23,154
TRAVIS: Percy, Keyleth.
LAURA: Trinket.

3364
02:45:23,154 --> 02:45:25,930
TRAVIS: Pike and Trinket.
So we start paddling in the boat.

3365
02:45:25,930 --> 02:45:30,094
LAURA: How about Kima and Clarota?
Clarota should go with us.

3366
02:45:30,094 --> 02:45:31,436
MATT: Clarota can just hover.

3367
02:45:31,436 --> 02:45:32,887
LAURA: Can Clarota be on the carpet, then?

3368
02:45:32,887 --> 02:45:34,091
MATT: You can have him
alongside the carpet.

3369
02:45:34,091 --> 02:45:35,349
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll take Kima.
LIAM: Yes.

3370
02:45:35,349 --> 02:45:37,125
LAURA: Yeah, Clarota come with us.
TRAVIS: (singing) Love Boat.

3371
02:45:37,125 --> 02:45:38,715
MATT: So Percy,
you're on the boat as well?

3372
02:45:38,715 --> 02:45:41,067
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm in the boat.

3373
02:45:41,067 --> 02:45:44,274
SAM: Are the rest of us flying?
We're flying.

3374
02:45:44,274 --> 02:45:47,323
LIAM: Team Clarence
and Team Kima-gibbler.

3375
02:45:47,323 --> 02:45:50,094
TRAVIS: Watch your mouth.

3376
02:45:50,094 --> 02:45:52,186
LAURA: Clarota, I'm sure
we've asked this before

3377
02:45:52,186 --> 02:45:56,256
and I wasn't here
because I missed a part of a thing?

3378
02:45:56,256 --> 02:46:02,469
What about your hat? What does it do?
Can you make more of them?

3379
02:46:02,469 --> 02:46:05,175
LIAM: He said no, it would take a while.
SAM: We did this already.

3380
02:46:05,175 --> 02:46:11,177
MATT: "I could, but the time required
would be months, weeks.

3381
02:46:11,177 --> 02:46:15,977
"Not in our timeframe, I believe."

3382
02:46:15,977 --> 02:46:16,942
TRAVIS: That's squid for no.

3383
02:46:16,942 --> 02:46:18,091
LAURA: All right.

3384
02:46:18,091 --> 02:46:19,485
LIAM: All right, let's do it.

3385
02:46:19,485 --> 02:46:23,098
Quiet ones, let's get on the carpet.
Tiberius?

3386
02:46:23,098 --> 02:46:25,934
LAURA: Try to stealth it.
Are we camouflaging the carpet?

3387
02:46:25,934 --> 02:46:27,170
TALIESIN: I'm going to attempt

3388
02:46:27,170 --> 02:46:29,956
to attach the skin
to the bottom of the carpet.

3389
02:46:29,956 --> 02:46:32,752
MATT: To the bottom of the carpet?

3390
02:46:32,752 --> 02:46:33,827
LIAM: We're saving the world,
here, people.

3391
02:46:33,827 --> 02:46:35,147
Let's not twiddle our thumbs
for too long.

3392
02:46:35,147 --> 02:46:36,418
TRAVIS: But you're on the boat.

3393
02:46:36,418 --> 02:46:37,850
TALIESIN: Well,
before you guys take off.

3394
02:46:37,850 --> 02:46:39,353
Just going to try
and sew it on the corners.

3395
02:46:39,353 --> 02:46:40,993
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a roll.

3396
02:46:40,993 --> 02:46:45,780
TALIESIN: That's better. 16.

3397
02:46:45,780 --> 02:46:47,584
MATT: 16. Easy enough to do.

3398
02:46:47,584 --> 02:46:50,289
All right, so you take a little bit
of your thick, heavy leather thread,

3399
02:46:50,289 --> 02:46:51,559
the stuff that you use for something,

3400
02:46:51,559 --> 02:46:53,980
and you loosely attach it
to the bottom of the carpet.

3401
02:46:53,980 --> 02:46:57,723
LIAM: Sorry,
I did a quick scrying spell

3402
02:46:57,723 --> 02:47:02,157
and I know that we're 50 shirts
away from the total, so keep going.

3403
02:47:02,157 --> 02:47:04,383
Get your mother a shirt. Keep going.

3404
02:47:04,383 --> 02:47:06,253
SAM: Okay, so we're over the water?

3405
02:47:06,253 --> 02:47:08,812
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're already paddling.
The boat's going too. We're fucking fast.

3406
02:47:08,812 --> 02:47:13,344
MATT: So, as Grog's pulling along--
make an athletics check, by the way.

3407
02:47:13,344 --> 02:47:14,937
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, about to smash you.

3408
02:47:14,937 --> 02:47:17,318
LAURA: And we're stealthing? Ahead?

3409
02:47:17,318 --> 02:47:19,776
MATT: You guys are--
LAURA: Being sneaky.

3410
02:47:19,776 --> 02:47:21,533
TRAVIS: It's a 22.

3411
02:47:21,533 --> 02:47:24,010
MATT: All right, so. You pull it across.

3412
02:47:24,010 --> 02:47:25,882
It's a slow speed,
but you're making your way.

3413
02:47:25,882 --> 02:47:30,367
I would also like Grog
to make a stealth check.

3414
02:47:30,367 --> 02:47:32,579
LAURA: I rolled a natural 20 on stealth.

3415
02:47:32,579 --> 02:47:34,735
TRAVIS: Where's my stealth?

3416
02:47:34,735 --> 02:47:35,984
TALIESIN: You've got
Pass Without a Trace also.

3417
02:47:35,984 --> 02:47:38,058
TRAVIS: 19. So 29.

3418
02:47:38,058 --> 02:47:42,959
MATT: 29 stealth. As you're very carefully
breaking the water's surface--

3419
02:47:42,959 --> 02:47:46,349
Okay, so as you guys
make your way across the channel

3420
02:47:46,349 --> 02:47:51,006
towards the far end of the island,
which is the beach that's in view,

3421
02:47:51,006 --> 02:47:57,364
you see the water disturbed slightly
about 200 feet off to the right.

3422
02:47:57,364 --> 02:48:02,694
Something deep below.
You can see bubbles rising up.

3423
02:48:02,694 --> 02:48:07,392
As you carefully make your way,
ever so quiet, across to the beach,

3424
02:48:07,392 --> 02:48:10,244
you find purchase.

3425
02:48:10,244 --> 02:48:13,044
Landfall hits you
on the other side of the beach,

3426
02:48:13,044 --> 02:48:14,871
apparently not disturbing
whatever lies beneath the surface.

3427
02:48:14,871 --> 02:48:17,645
TRAVIS: I immediately hop out,
pull the boat up just to beach the boat.

3428
02:48:17,645 --> 02:48:19,039
MATT: Okay, so you pull the boat up.

3429
02:48:19,039 --> 02:48:20,452
The rest of you guys
bring the carpet over.

3430
02:48:20,452 --> 02:48:22,496
You come to a landing part,
totally fine.

3431
02:48:22,496 --> 02:48:25,463
The beach comes to a steep incline
that leads up onto the island proper.

3432
02:48:25,463 --> 02:48:27,291
There's cliffs
on both sides of this beach,

3433
02:48:27,291 --> 02:48:29,143
and as the incline increases

3434
02:48:29,143 --> 02:48:31,327
up about maybe 500, 600 feet
from where you are,

3435
02:48:31,327 --> 02:48:34,050
you can see what looks like
a few buildings

3436
02:48:34,050 --> 02:48:36,782
or rubble of what was
a small gathering of structures.

3437
02:48:36,782 --> 02:48:39,945
LAURA: Can we check out
the thing in the air?

3438
02:48:39,945 --> 02:48:42,410
LIAM: Is there a larger one
behind those smaller structures?

3439
02:48:42,410 --> 02:48:43,445
LAURA: That was it.

3440
02:48:43,445 --> 02:48:46,328
MATT: What you're seeing now is this.

3441
02:48:46,328 --> 02:48:48,890
TRAVIS: Are there any
of those crazy trees you mentioned before?

3442
02:48:48,890 --> 02:48:51,592
MATT: You do see, towards the right
of those structures,

3443
02:48:51,592 --> 02:48:55,538
those fungal-based trees.

3444
02:48:55,538 --> 02:48:59,437
They rise about 25, 30 feet in the air.
There's no leaves.

3445
02:48:59,437 --> 02:49:03,401
It's almost like a cluster
of weird fungus-like vines

3446
02:49:03,401 --> 02:49:05,572
that drift from the top surface,

3447
02:49:05,572 --> 02:49:07,539
and the trees unnaturally sway in place,

3448
02:49:07,539 --> 02:49:10,162
almost like they have a rhythm
to their movement.

3449
02:49:10,162 --> 02:49:11,584
TRAVIS: Dr. Seuss trees. Not cool.

3450
02:49:11,584 --> 02:49:12,566
MATT: Really nasty Dr. Seuss trees.

3451
02:49:12,566 --> 02:49:14,236
LAURA: Clarota,
will those trees attack us?

3452
02:49:14,236 --> 02:49:16,842
Are they living and attack-y?

3453
02:49:16,842 --> 02:49:21,908
MATT: Clarota says, "No, those trees
merely exist on this island.

3454
02:49:21,908 --> 02:49:24,093
"They feed off of the essence of it

3455
02:49:24,093 --> 02:49:28,567
"and they provide food
for other things that live here."

3456
02:49:28,567 --> 02:49:32,042
TRAVIS: Like what?
MARISHA: Trees are bad?

3457
02:49:32,042 --> 02:49:35,082
MATT: "Wandering spores."
LAURA: Wandering spores?!

3458
02:49:35,082 --> 02:49:37,856
MATT: "Other creatures."
TRAVIS: Other creatures?

3459
02:49:37,856 --> 02:49:42,857
MATT: "We feed our captives,
our slaves of the colony,

3460
02:49:42,857 --> 02:49:45,538
"with the fungal essence
of the tree."

3461
02:49:45,538 --> 02:49:46,495
TRAVIS: Other creatures?

3462
02:49:46,495 --> 02:49:49,351
Don't skimp on the details,
it's only our lives.

3463
02:49:49,351 --> 02:49:56,204
MATT: "The trees are not dangerous,
but whatever resides on this island

3464
02:49:56,204 --> 02:50:00,184
"is probably under the influence
of the Elder Brain.

3465
02:50:00,184 --> 02:50:05,928
"And my people, which are in turn
under the influence of K'Varn."

3466
02:50:05,928 --> 02:50:07,956
LIAM: But as you're from this island,

3467
02:50:07,956 --> 02:50:10,726
what wildlife
can we expect to run into here?

3468
02:50:10,726 --> 02:50:17,611
MATT: "Small, sightless rats.
Cavern insects.

3469
02:50:17,611 --> 02:50:25,782
"But the dangers lie in the spores
that wander the forests."

3470
02:50:25,782 --> 02:50:28,535
LAURA: I'm picturing
a big yellow thing with little legs.

3471
02:50:28,535 --> 02:50:29,423
SAM: Pus.
LIAM: Fuzzball.

3472
02:50:29,423 --> 02:50:30,936
LAURA: Is that what it is?

3473
02:50:30,936 --> 02:50:34,200
MATT: "You'll know when you see it."

3474
02:50:34,200 --> 02:50:35,888
LAURA: Well, that's lovely.
Thank you for your help.

3475
02:50:35,888 --> 02:50:38,539
MATT: "Spiny."
LAURA: Spiny.

3476
02:50:38,539 --> 02:50:40,331
MATT: "Drifting."

3477
02:50:40,331 --> 02:50:43,950
TRAVIS: I take the cask of ale
out of the Bag of Holding

3478
02:50:43,950 --> 02:50:46,087
and pour him a little glass of ale,
and I'm like--

3479
02:50:46,087 --> 02:50:47,392
LAURA: Oh, you know what, Grog,
I hate to tell you this--

3480
02:50:47,392 --> 02:50:50,000
TRAVIS: It sounds a little scratchy.
Would you care for some ale?

3481
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:51,280
LIAM: It's really good.

3482
02:50:51,280 --> 02:50:52,803
MATT: It's a psychic discussion.

3483
02:50:52,803 --> 02:50:56,917
He looks at you
and gives you a stern look.

3484
02:50:56,917 --> 02:50:59,020
Takes the ale from you.

3485
02:50:59,020 --> 02:51:04,584
TRAVIS: Why?

3486
02:51:04,584 --> 02:51:09,299
MATT: "I have no need
for such false sustenance."

3487
02:51:09,299 --> 02:51:11,159
LIAM: Clarota, that was rude.

3488
02:51:11,159 --> 02:51:15,602
TRAVIS: I will not forget that.

3489
02:51:15,602 --> 02:51:18,602
LIAM: Very rude. All right.

3490
02:51:18,602 --> 02:51:22,219
SAM: Can we go inspect
those structures up there?

3491
02:51:22,219 --> 02:51:23,449
LIAM: Yes, everyone wait here.

3492
02:51:23,449 --> 02:51:27,009
I grab Scanlan by the scruff of the neck
and nod at my sister.

3493
02:51:27,009 --> 02:51:28,253
SAM: I turn invisible.

3494
02:51:28,253 --> 02:51:31,016
LIAM: Let's go take a peek, yes?
We'll take a peek. Just wait a minute.

3495
02:51:31,016 --> 02:51:33,140
TALIESIN: We can wait. That's fine.

3496
02:51:33,140 --> 02:51:39,021
MARISHA: I actually go collect
a few of the vines hanging from the trees.

3497
02:51:39,021 --> 02:51:42,730
MATT: All right.
Go ahead and make a nature check.

3498
02:51:42,730 --> 02:51:45,965
TALIESIN: General perception check
on the beach as well.

3499
02:51:45,965 --> 02:51:47,291
MATT: All right.

3500
02:51:47,291 --> 02:51:52,518
TALIESIN: I don't know why I'm bothering.
11. It's a beach.

3501
02:51:52,518 --> 02:51:53,608
TRAVIS: I rolled 15.

3502
02:51:53,608 --> 02:51:54,963
MARISHA: 16.

3503
02:51:54,963 --> 02:51:55,958
MATT: 16 on nature?

3504
02:51:55,958 --> 02:51:58,896
Okay, from a safe distance,
you look at it.

3505
02:51:58,896 --> 02:52:04,465
The trees do not appear to be anything
beyond a subterranean forest.

3506
02:52:04,465 --> 02:52:06,271
Fungal trees.

3507
02:52:06,271 --> 02:52:07,848
MARISHA: I wanted to collect some.

3508
02:52:07,848 --> 02:52:09,328
MATT: Oh, you wanted to go over
and collect some?

3509
02:52:09,328 --> 02:52:12,709
Okay. It's quite a ways up.
It's up the side of the cliff.

3510
02:52:12,709 --> 02:52:16,023
It's up an incline,
and the forest starts

3511
02:52:16,023 --> 02:52:19,023
adjacent to the structure
where they're going.

3512
02:52:19,023 --> 02:52:20,795
TALIESIN: Might want to wait.

3513
02:52:20,795 --> 02:52:23,599
MATT: So you can make a stealth check
to make your way there, if you'd like.

3514
02:52:23,599 --> 02:52:26,122
MARISHA: No, I'll wait.
I thought we were next to a tree.

3515
02:52:26,122 --> 02:52:28,651
MATT: No, most of the forest
starts further up this incline

3516
02:52:28,651 --> 02:52:30,381
as the island itself
begins to level off.

3517
02:52:30,381 --> 02:52:31,908
TALIESIN: Let the scouts scout.

3518
02:52:31,908 --> 02:52:33,244
SAM: Let's go scout it out.

3519
02:52:33,244 --> 02:52:34,188
MATT: All right.

3520
02:52:34,188 --> 02:52:36,234
SAM: So we make our way
up to the structure.

3521
02:52:36,234 --> 02:52:37,274
LIAM: 28 for stealth.

3522
02:52:37,274 --> 02:52:39,150
MATT: 28 for stealth.
You get advantage on your roll.

3523
02:52:39,150 --> 02:52:41,498
LAURA: Is it our old stealth check?

3524
02:52:41,498 --> 02:52:44,470
Can I use my flying stealth check?
Damn it.

3525
02:52:44,470 --> 02:52:45,497
SAM: Nope.

3526
02:52:45,497 --> 02:52:47,034
MATT: What did you roll?
SAM: Three.

3527
02:52:47,034 --> 02:52:49,355
MATT: With advantage?

3528
02:52:49,355 --> 02:52:51,694
SAM: That was my advantage.
The first one was a one.

3529
02:52:51,694 --> 02:52:55,036
(all laugh)

3530
02:52:55,036 --> 02:52:56,740
LAURA: 31.
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

3531
02:52:56,740 --> 02:52:59,749
MATT: All right. So.
LIAM: Do the twins outweigh him?

3532
02:52:59,749 --> 02:53:01,996
SAM: Wait, plus two! That makes it five.

3533
02:53:01,996 --> 02:53:04,381
LAURA: Plus ten. Pass Without a Trace.

3534
02:53:04,381 --> 02:53:05,907
SAM: Oh, plus ten! That's 15!

3535
02:53:05,916 --> 02:53:11,149
TRAVIS: We're getting better!
Plus my inspiration from paddling.

3536
02:53:11,149 --> 02:53:17,566
MATT: You guys make your way
towards this ruin, and as you come to it,

3537
02:53:17,566 --> 02:53:23,725
you caught a small glimmer of it
on the bridge that was constructed

3538
02:53:23,725 --> 02:53:25,990
across the first beach you came across
in this cavern.

3539
02:53:25,990 --> 02:53:30,632
The stonework is interesting.

3540
02:53:30,632 --> 02:53:33,645
It's almost like an influx
of jade and marble.

3541
02:53:33,645 --> 02:53:35,340
The stone itself

3542
02:53:35,340 --> 02:53:38,205
does not seem to be anything
you've seen naturally around the cavern;

3543
02:53:38,205 --> 02:53:40,809
either it was brought here
or was crafted

3544
02:53:40,809 --> 02:53:44,698
from some substance
that resides on this island.

3545
02:53:44,698 --> 02:53:50,287
But it has this weird green jade,
marble, almost...

3546
02:53:50,287 --> 02:53:52,907
vein-like visual to it.

3547
02:53:52,907 --> 02:53:56,536
And you notice all the structures
aren't straight and smooth.

3548
02:53:56,536 --> 02:53:59,395
Everything has this slightly
non-Euclidean bend to it.

3549
02:53:59,395 --> 02:54:03,966
Every edge has a slight curve.

3550
02:54:03,966 --> 02:54:05,616
It's off-putting.

3551
02:54:05,616 --> 02:54:08,899
There isn't a rigidity
to any of these walls,

3552
02:54:08,899 --> 02:54:11,974
and the buildings themselves
almost seem to sag,

3553
02:54:11,974 --> 02:54:16,260
or they sit or rest at a strange,
unnatural angle.

3554
02:54:16,260 --> 02:54:17,724
LAURA: These buildings are sad.

3555
02:54:17,724 --> 02:54:19,795
MATT: Many have been long-crumbled,

3556
02:54:19,795 --> 02:54:23,238
and you find some of these buildings
have fallen in on themselves.

3557
02:54:23,238 --> 02:54:27,314
You do notice,
as you approach the edge of it,

3558
02:54:27,314 --> 02:54:32,250
there is a large, circular structure.

3559
02:54:32,250 --> 02:54:35,850
A pit that is built central to this.

3560
02:54:35,850 --> 02:54:38,731
Parts of the wall have fallen in,

3561
02:54:38,731 --> 02:54:40,200
but for the most part
still remains intact,

3562
02:54:40,200 --> 02:54:42,661
and in the center of this pit,
on the floor,

3563
02:54:42,661 --> 02:54:47,507
you can see what looks
like splotches of dried crimson,

3564
02:54:47,507 --> 02:54:52,188
long-left blood splatters
of some sort of creature.

3565
02:54:52,188 --> 02:54:57,172
You see dried bones,
but the bones, while dried,

3566
02:54:57,172 --> 02:55:00,156
have some sort of fungus
growing on them.

3567
02:55:00,156 --> 02:55:03,457
You also see what looks to be,
tucked against one of the walls,

3568
02:55:03,457 --> 02:55:09,072
a campsite.
But a very large campsite.

3569
02:55:09,072 --> 02:55:11,937
The fire pit is 15 feet wide
and is just a small cinder.

3570
02:55:11,937 --> 02:55:15,019
You see what looks to be
a pile of furs.

3571
02:55:15,019 --> 02:55:16,342
SAM: A recent campsite?

3572
02:55:16,342 --> 02:55:18,787
MATT: There is actual embers
in the fire pit.

3573
02:55:18,787 --> 02:55:23,731
There looks to be
a large bedroll made of patchwork furs,

3574
02:55:23,731 --> 02:55:27,909
but the pile itself is huge.

3575
02:55:27,909 --> 02:55:30,204
LIAM: But it looks twice the size
of what I would use for a fire,

3576
02:55:30,204 --> 02:55:31,823
or what I would use for a bedroll.

3577
02:55:31,823 --> 02:55:33,300
MATT: Three times, even,

3578
02:55:33,300 --> 02:55:34,499
which means it houses
a lot of individuals.

3579
02:55:34,499 --> 02:55:37,067
SAM: Or one big thing.

3580
02:55:37,067 --> 02:55:38,730
MARISHA: Or a really big thing.

3581
02:55:38,730 --> 02:55:39,974
LIAM: Giants.
MARISHA: Yeah.

3582
02:55:39,974 --> 02:55:41,440
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3583
02:55:41,440 --> 02:55:46,477
MATT: As you're taking this look, too,
as you guys are having this visual, you--

3584
02:55:46,477 --> 02:55:48,872
LIAM: Question: bigger than Grog?

3585
02:55:48,872 --> 02:55:55,626
MATT: Well.
You immediately hear a sound.

3586
02:55:55,626 --> 02:56:01,174
It's a slight rumble in the ground
and what sounds like a footfall,

3587
02:56:01,174 --> 02:56:06,801
and as you glance over your shoulder,
you can see what looks to be

3588
02:56:06,801 --> 02:56:10,185
some sort of towering humanoid
dragging something behind it.

3589
02:56:10,185 --> 02:56:12,193
SAM: (singing)
There are giants in the sky.

3590
02:56:12,193 --> 02:56:17,012
MATT: It glances up
with its nose in the air (sniffs).

3591
02:56:17,012 --> 02:56:19,230
"Who goes there?"

3592
02:56:19,230 --> 02:56:24,243
And you look to see
what looks large, almost goliath-like:

3593
02:56:24,243 --> 02:56:30,736
bald, skin is smooth, no hair,
but its skin is purplish in color.

3594
02:56:30,736 --> 02:56:33,600
Where a normal giant
would stand naturally,

3595
02:56:33,600 --> 02:56:34,682
it's horribly hunched,

3596
02:56:34,682 --> 02:56:37,933
like its back has
a horrible scoliosis twist to it.

3597
02:56:37,933 --> 02:56:41,102
One giant popping yellow eye
glances out

3598
02:56:41,102 --> 02:56:43,219
towards the edge
of where you guys are.

3599
02:56:43,219 --> 02:56:45,204
It doesn't seem
to have found any of you immediately,

3600
02:56:45,204 --> 02:56:46,716
but something has alerted its attention;

3601
02:56:46,716 --> 02:56:48,037
it seems to have caught
some sort of trail

3602
02:56:48,037 --> 02:56:49,099
in its natural homestead.

3603
02:56:49,099 --> 02:56:54,380
You see it standing probably
close to 15, 20 feet in height

3604
02:56:54,380 --> 02:56:58,818
as it begins lumbering up 
(krsh krsh krsh) towards you.

3605
02:56:58,818 --> 02:56:59,907
LIAM: Stealthed.

3606
02:56:59,907 --> 02:57:02,854
LAURA: Oh, should we hide?
Can we try to hide?

3607
02:57:02,854 --> 02:57:04,590
MATT: All of you
were stealthed as well.

3608
02:57:04,590 --> 02:57:06,631
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

3609
02:57:06,631 --> 02:57:11,607
Can I do insight
and see if it seems like a bad guy?

3610
02:57:11,607 --> 02:57:13,954
MATT: You can make an insight check.

3611
02:57:13,954 --> 02:57:18,052
LAURA: I know. I'm just checking
to see if he's a misunderstood guy.

3612
02:57:18,052 --> 02:57:20,038
TRAVIS: Do I see him?
Can I do a simple recognize check?

3613
02:57:20,038 --> 02:57:21,608
MATT: You don't see him.
All you guys

3614
02:57:21,608 --> 02:57:24,178
are staying back at the beach
while they're checking.

3615
02:57:24,178 --> 02:57:28,152
ORION: Both of you have got earrings.

3616
02:57:28,152 --> 02:57:29,848
LAURA: That's 17.

3617
02:57:29,848 --> 02:57:34,210
MATT: 17? This entity
looks like it's hungry,

3618
02:57:34,210 --> 02:57:37,304
it looks malicious,

3619
02:57:37,304 --> 02:57:41,461
and looks like it's caught
the thrill of the hunt,

3620
02:57:41,461 --> 02:57:46,126
since it seems to have seen something
near its homestead moving.

3621
02:57:46,126 --> 02:57:49,389
As it begins to step forward,
it drops whatever it's holding behind it.

3622
02:57:49,389 --> 02:57:50,954
LIAM: I'm picking up Scanlan
and moving backwards.

3623
02:57:50,954 --> 02:57:52,906
LAURA: Yeah, can we move into the shadows?

3624
02:57:52,906 --> 02:57:53,893
SAM: I'm invisible.

3625
02:57:53,893 --> 02:57:55,918
LIAM: You're right there.
LAURA: We know where you are.

3626
02:57:55,918 --> 02:57:58,119
LIAM: I was holding your hand
the whole time.

3627
02:57:58,119 --> 02:57:59,299
SAM: Okay.

3628
02:57:59,299 --> 02:58:02,437
MATT: And that is where
we're going to leave tonight's session.

3629
02:58:02,437 --> 02:58:04,362
(all groan)

3630
02:58:04,362 --> 02:58:06,631
TRAVIS: Come on!
LIAM: Nowhere near K'Varn.

3631
02:58:06,631 --> 02:58:08,813
MARISHA AND TRAVIS: Really?
LIAM: Nowhere near him.

3632
02:58:08,813 --> 02:58:10,937
ORION: No.
MATT: Yeah.

3633
02:58:10,937 --> 02:58:16,054
TRAVIS: But wait,
maybe if we sell out the shirts

3634
02:58:16,054 --> 02:58:19,110
we can go another half-hour
or something.

3635
02:58:19,110 --> 02:58:21,354
MARISHA: Yeah, how many shirts
do we have left?

3636
02:58:21,354 --> 02:58:23,027
ORION: Like 20 or something like that?

3637
02:58:23,027 --> 02:58:24,017
SAM: Didn't make it.

3638
02:58:24,017 --> 02:58:27,667
Didn't make it to K'Varn,
didn't make it to the shirts.

3639
02:58:27,667 --> 02:58:30,533
LIAM: It's K'Varn!

3640
02:58:30,533 --> 02:58:34,625
ZAC: We have to read
all the donation messages.

3641
02:58:34,625 --> 02:58:38,782
If we meet our goal for the shirts
by the time we're done reading--

3642
02:58:38,782 --> 02:58:40,402
LAURA: 20 shirts!

3643
02:58:40,402 --> 02:58:43,016
ZAC: Then are you guys cool
with doing the Q&amp;A?

3644
02:58:43,016 --> 02:58:44,160
ALL: Yeah!

3645
02:58:44,160 --> 02:58:46,746
ZAC: All right, so.
LIAM: If you sell those 20 shirts.

3646
02:58:46,746 --> 02:58:47,790
TRAVIS: There's 20 shirts left?
LAURA: That's it.

3647
02:58:47,790 --> 02:58:49,111
LIAM: Come on, guys. 20 shirts.

3648
02:58:49,111 --> 02:58:52,713
LAURA: Me and Pike bought hoodies.
ZAC: Go fuck it up.

3649
02:58:52,713 --> 02:58:55,254
ASHLEY: I bought a hoodie.
LAURA: I bought a hoodie.

3650
02:58:55,254 --> 02:58:58,650
ZAC: All right, I'm just going to try
to open this up here.

3651
02:58:58,650 --> 02:59:00,572
LAURA: We could all be hoodie Twinkies.

3652
02:59:00,572 --> 02:59:02,244
ORION: We have Twinkies?

3653
02:59:02,244 --> 02:59:04,438
TALIESIN: There's no Twinkies.
There's just cake.

3654
02:59:04,438 --> 02:59:06,821
SAM: That was the stoner-est thing
you've ever said.

3655
02:59:06,821 --> 02:59:13,271
LIAM: I'll buy a hoodie
if you guys buy 19. Deal? Here we go.

3656
02:59:13,271 --> 02:59:15,531
MATT: What are you doing, man?

3657
02:59:15,531 --> 02:59:18,041
ZAC: I'm trying to load it
into Google Docs

3658
02:59:18,041 --> 02:59:19,831
so we can actually see the messages.

3659
02:59:19,831 --> 02:59:21,896
LAURA: He's taking his time.

3660
02:59:21,896 --> 02:59:25,074
MATT: Oh, that's much easier.
In theory.

3661

03:23:32,157 --> 03:23:35,102
LAURA: Can we talk
about Keyleth's child murdering?

4098
03:23:35,102 --> 03:23:36,182
MARISHA: (laughs)

4099
03:23:36,182 --> 03:23:38,432
TRAVIS: How did the kid die, Marisha?
TALIESIN: Yeah, tell them.

4100
03:23:38,432 --> 03:23:39,485
LAURA: This was sad.

4101
03:23:39,485 --> 03:23:44,870
MARISHA: God, I got asked this question
at the panel over the weekend, too.

4102
03:23:44,870 --> 03:23:45,932
It's a hot topic.

4103
03:23:45,932 --> 03:23:47,145
Everyone wants to know
how I killed the kid.

4104
03:23:47,145 --> 03:23:49,188
Well, we were fighting-- 
tell us about the fight.

4105
03:23:49,188 --> 03:23:53,255
MATT: Over the course
of the first major arc of their campaign,

4106
03:23:53,255 --> 03:23:55,002
every town they went to,
there seemed to be

4107
03:23:55,002 --> 03:23:57,767
this recurring theme
of children disappearing,

4108
03:23:57,767 --> 03:24:00,555
so they kept trying
to follow this thread and asking around,

4109
03:24:00,555 --> 03:24:01,369
and these kids kept vanishing,

4110
03:24:01,369 --> 03:24:03,989
and the one common thread
they were discovering was,

4111
03:24:03,989 --> 03:24:04,996
shortly before each kid disappeared,

4112
03:24:04,996 --> 03:24:10,747
they began playing with a new kid
who had long black hair and golden eyes.

4113
03:24:10,747 --> 03:24:13,340
And then they would disappear
within a week of playing with that child.

4114
03:24:13,340 --> 03:24:16,210
Towards the end of the campaign,
during a celebration,

4115
03:24:16,210 --> 03:24:19,949
after they managed to save
the city of Emon,

4116
03:24:19,949 --> 03:24:24,217
they looked over and found
that the Sovereign Uriel's child

4117
03:24:24,217 --> 03:24:27,572
was talking to this black-haired,
golden-eyed child.

4118
03:24:27,572 --> 03:24:31,837
So the party, in the middle
of a platform, grandstand,

4119
03:24:31,837 --> 03:24:33,097
bowing before the townspeople,

4120
03:24:33,097 --> 03:24:35,242
they just pulled their weapons out
and jumped off after this child,

4121
03:24:35,242 --> 03:24:39,060
who grabbed the sovereign's son
and pulled him into this pocket dimension.

4122
03:24:39,060 --> 03:24:41,125
What it turned out to be was this entity,

4123
03:24:41,125 --> 03:24:43,856
which is a variation
of the Dread Emperor,

4124
03:24:43,856 --> 03:24:47,544
for those who are familiar
with that character.

4125
03:24:47,544 --> 03:24:50,191
The Dread Emperor had created
this pocket dimension world,

4126
03:24:50,191 --> 03:24:51,038
this giant bramble forest

4127
03:24:51,038 --> 03:24:52,519
that surrounded a gothic castle
where it existed.

4128
03:24:52,519 --> 03:24:56,588
This weird, messed-up individual
brought children there

4129
03:24:56,588 --> 03:25:03,862
because it loved to be around
their innocence and their naivety,

4130
03:25:03,862 --> 03:25:04,717
their sense of play.

4131
03:25:04,717 --> 03:25:08,326
MARISHA: So basically,
a sorcerer Neverland Ranch.

4132
03:25:08,326 --> 03:25:09,832
MATT: Yeah. It was messed up.

4133
03:25:09,832 --> 03:25:11,711
But once the children got too old,
they were no longer useful,

4134
03:25:11,711 --> 03:25:14,825
so he killed them
and put them in a basement.

4135
03:25:14,825 --> 03:25:18,702
So the party gave chase,
they fought their way to the castle,

4136
03:25:18,702 --> 03:25:23,003
and they discovered
that what was dangerous

4137
03:25:23,003 --> 03:25:26,424
about fighting this Dread Emperor
in his library

4138
03:25:26,424 --> 03:25:28,062
was it was wearing golden armor,

4139
03:25:28,062 --> 03:25:31,737
and attached to this armor via four chains
were four children by collars,

4140
03:25:31,737 --> 03:25:33,275
and if anyone attacked him directly,

4141
03:25:33,275 --> 03:25:37,116
he shared the damage he took
with the children.

4142
03:25:37,116 --> 03:25:40,679
MARISHA: And we actually found
these clippers for the chain.

4143
03:25:40,679 --> 03:25:44,016
LAURA: Big golden scissors,
but we put them in our pocket

4144
03:25:44,016 --> 03:25:45,261
and forgot that we had them.

4145
03:25:45,261 --> 03:25:48,789
MARISHA: We were like,
"sweet clippers. Pocket. Keep going."

4146
03:25:48,789 --> 03:25:53,601
And then we get to this emperor
with these giant gold chains

4147
03:25:53,601 --> 03:25:56,139
and we're like,
"How do you break these gold chains?

4148
03:25:56,139 --> 03:26:01,577
"If only we had clippers.
Oh, well, we don't."

4149
03:26:01,577 --> 03:26:03,415
MATT: However, you guys started 
attacking the chains with your weapons,

4150
03:26:03,415 --> 03:26:05,519
and you were doing enough damage
during the first few rounds

4151
03:26:05,519 --> 03:26:07,984
to save most of the kids.

4152
03:26:07,984 --> 03:26:09,839
LAURA: But there was one kid left.

4153
03:26:09,839 --> 03:26:10,850
MARISHA: So there was one.

4154
03:26:10,850 --> 03:26:15,626
So we were trying
to get these kids away from us

4155
03:26:15,626 --> 03:26:18,432
because we don't want to hurt them,
but we wanted them away,

4156
03:26:18,432 --> 03:26:23,545
so I used a Grasping Vine,
and I was trying to yank the kid away,

4157
03:26:23,545 --> 03:26:30,455
but the Grasping Vine attached
to the chain instead of the kid,

4158
03:26:30,455 --> 03:26:38,238
so with the chain at the collar
around his neck, when the vine yanked--

4159
03:26:38,238 --> 03:26:39,866
MATT: You broke the kid's neck.

4160
03:26:39,866 --> 03:26:41,096
LAURA: I thought
you grabbed the kid's waist

4161
03:26:41,096 --> 03:26:44,683
and he got pulled toward the thing,
but the chain was still around his neck.

4162
03:26:44,683 --> 03:26:46,650
MATT: That's what happened.
The vine wrapped around his body

4163
03:26:46,650 --> 03:26:50,593
and it broke his neck
because he was still attached.

4164
03:26:50,593 --> 03:26:52,083
MARISHA: Oh, that's right.

4165
03:26:52,113 --> 03:26:53,710
I should have grabbed the chain,
but instead--

4166
03:26:53,710 --> 03:26:55,573
MATT: You just grabbed the kid.

4167
03:26:55,573 --> 03:26:58,109
TRAVIS: Sam, what's it like
being the sexiest member of the group?

4168
03:26:58,109 --> 03:26:59,946
SAM: Is that what one of the things was?

4169
03:26:59,946 --> 03:27:01,840
TRAVIS: Yep.
TALIESIN: We just want to know.

4170
03:27:01,840 --> 03:27:02,919
SAM: It's a lot like life.

4171
03:27:02,919 --> 03:27:03,750
(all laugh)

4172
03:27:03,750 --> 03:27:10,273
SAM: I've come to accept it.
It's the hand I was dealt.

4173
03:27:10,273 --> 03:27:11,844
TRAVIS: Matt, how do you deal
with writer's block,

4174
03:27:11,844 --> 03:27:15,008
and when can we expect Trinket plushies?

4175
03:27:15,008 --> 03:27:17,640
MATT: Trinket plushies would be amazing.

4176
03:27:17,640 --> 03:27:19,307
I would love to expect those
at some point in the future.

4177
03:27:19,307 --> 03:27:20,331
TALIESIN: I want plushies for all of us.

4178
03:27:20,331 --> 03:27:24,165
LIAM: We could expect Trinket plushies.
It might not be next week,

4179
03:27:24,165 --> 03:27:26,843
but I feel like within 12 months,
there will be a Trinket plushie.

4180
03:27:26,843 --> 03:27:27,974
MATT: I'd like that. That would be cool.

4181
03:27:27,974 --> 03:27:29,784
LAURA: If Trinket survives for 12 months.

4182
03:27:29,784 --> 03:27:34,200
MATT: As far as writer's block?
Good music.

4183
03:27:34,200 --> 03:27:36,119
I have a number of playlists,
where if I'm having a problem,

4184
03:27:36,119 --> 03:27:38,268
I just close my eyes
and listen to good music.

4185
03:27:38,268 --> 03:27:41,456
A lot of soundtracks.
I find Elder Scrolls soundtrack is great.

4186
03:27:41,456 --> 03:27:44,820
Stuff like that. Gets my mind going.

4187
03:27:44,820 --> 03:27:46,300
TRAVIS: How did the group
come up with Vox Machina?

4188
03:27:46,300 --> 03:27:47,333
TALIESIN: Well...

4189
03:27:47,333 --> 03:27:50,918
(all laugh)

4190
03:27:50,918 --> 03:27:53,565
TALIESIN: Oh, god.
Do we really want to tell this story?

4191
03:27:53,565 --> 03:27:55,925
LIAM: How we came up with Vox Machina?
Is that the question?

4192
03:27:55,925 --> 03:27:58,065
ZAC: They asked it!

4193
03:27:58,085 --> 03:27:59,445
LAURA: Yeah, our previous name.

4194
03:27:59,445 --> 03:28:00,120
SAM: We needed to come up with a name.

4195
03:28:00,120 --> 03:28:01,587
LIAM: We used to be the SHITs.

4196
03:28:01,587 --> 03:28:04,057
We used to be
the Super High Intensity Team, the SHITs.

4197
03:28:04,057 --> 03:28:05,984
TALIESIN: The SHITs.
ASHLEY: Which I'm still a fan of.

4198
03:28:05,984 --> 03:28:08,233
LAURA: I think it's awesome.
TRAVIS: Yeah, me, too. SHITs forever.

4199
03:28:08,233 --> 03:28:09,438
SAM: Some people
didn't think that it was--

4200
03:28:09,438 --> 03:28:12,311
LAURA: Some people
that are maybe druid and--

4201
03:28:12,311 --> 03:28:13,485
TRAVIS: Royalty.

4202
03:28:13,485 --> 03:28:15,424
SAM: So we had to come up
with something less provocative.

4203
03:28:15,424 --> 03:28:16,879
TALIESIN: We tried to come up
with something

4204
03:28:16,879 --> 03:28:19,084
as we were slowly gaining esteem.

4205
03:28:19,084 --> 03:28:21,036
MARISHA: Hey, there was a few of us
with family ties.

4206
03:28:21,036 --> 03:28:22,034
TALIESIN: We were all like,

4207
03:28:22,034 --> 03:28:24,531
"okay, perhaps we don't want
to be known as the SHITs."

4208
03:28:24,531 --> 03:28:25,644
MARISHA: Over here, as well,
and over here.

4209
03:28:25,644 --> 03:28:26,305
TALIESIN: No, I was with you.

4210
03:28:26,305 --> 03:28:28,965
MARISHA: All these people
with royal family ties.

4211
03:28:28,965 --> 03:28:31,041
TALIESIN: I have a family name. No.

4212
03:28:31,041 --> 03:28:33,620
MARISHA: Can't be a part of the SHITs.

4213
03:28:33,620 --> 03:28:37,972
"What have you been doing
for the last ten years, Keyleth?" "Well."

4214
03:28:37,972 --> 03:28:39,546
TALIESIN: "I've been the SHITs."

4215
03:28:39,546 --> 03:28:40,870
(all laugh)

4216
03:28:40,870 --> 03:28:43,643
MATT: Someone asked if the group
would ever do Hot Pepper Gaming.

4217
03:28:43,643 --> 03:28:44,526
MATT AND TALIESIN: (laugh)

4218
03:28:44,526 --> 03:28:46,987
MATT: There are plans in place
for most of us to partake.

4219
03:28:46,987 --> 03:28:48,072
I don't know if everyone will,
but some will.

4220
03:28:48,072 --> 03:28:49,449
MARISHA: Again.
TALIESIN: Quite a few.

4221
03:28:49,449 --> 03:28:51,499
MATT: Yeah, so that will be fun.

4222
03:28:51,499 --> 03:28:53,472
LIAM: Someone is asking
what Matt whispered to me

4223
03:28:53,472 --> 03:28:56,678
when I insight-checked Marisha.

4224
03:28:56,678 --> 03:29:01,397
It's not what you think it is,
and I'm not going to say.

4225
03:29:01,397 --> 03:29:03,364
LAURA AND ASHLEY: Ooh.

4226
03:29:03,364 --> 03:29:05,768
LAURA: I saw, what color is Trinket
and what color is his armor?

4227
03:29:05,768 --> 03:29:07,418
He's brown, and he's got silver armor.

4228
03:29:07,418 --> 03:29:08,146
TALIESIN: We accept fanfic
as our personal savior.

4229
03:29:08,146 --> 03:29:09,758
LIAM: It's moving too fast.

4230
03:29:09,758 --> 03:29:13,336
TRAVIS: I saw, what level is everyone,
and what is your alignment?

4231
03:29:13,336 --> 03:29:14,585
TALIESIN: Just became ten.
MARISHA: Ten.

4232
03:29:14,585 --> 03:29:16,727
MATT: Everyone's ten now, I think.

4233
03:29:16,727 --> 03:29:18,523
ASHLEY: I don't think I am yet,
because I missed a lot of games.

4234
03:29:18,523 --> 03:29:19,844
TRAVIS: Alignments, starting with Liam.

4235
03:29:19,844 --> 03:29:22,774
LIAM: Chaotic good.
TRAVIS: Chaotic good. Tiberius?

4236
03:29:22,774 --> 03:29:24,615
ORION: Huh?
LIAM, MATT, AND TRAVIS: Your alignment.

4237
03:29:24,615 --> 03:29:26,310
MATT: It's a Q&amp;A.

4238
03:29:26,310 --> 03:29:27,640
ORION: Yeah, I know.

4239
03:29:27,640 --> 03:29:29,891
These guys were talking
about stuff I know about,

4240
03:29:29,891 --> 03:29:31,511
and I was responding to other people
that were talking on Twitter.

4241
03:29:31,511 --> 03:29:33,119
TRAVIS: What's your alignment?
ORION: Chaotic good.

4242
03:29:33,119 --> 03:29:36,115
TRAVIS: (laughs)
LAURA: Oh, that makes sense.

4243
03:29:36,115 --> 03:29:39,796
MARISHA: Neutral good.
ASHLEY: I'm chaotic good.

4244
03:29:39,796 --> 03:29:43,370
TRAVIS: Percy?
TALIESIN: I believe neutral good.

4245
03:29:43,370 --> 03:29:45,675
TRAVIS: I'm chaotic neutral. Sam?
SAM: I think I'm neutral good.

4246
03:29:45,675 --> 03:29:46,900
LAURA: I'm neutral good.

4247
03:29:46,900 --> 03:29:48,859
ASHLEY: Wait, chaotic good?
Does that make sense? Is that what I am?

4248
03:29:48,859 --> 03:29:49,650
LAURA: I don't think you're chaotic.

4249
03:29:49,650 --> 03:29:50,252
TRAVIS: "Is that what I am?"

4250
03:29:50,252 --> 03:29:52,515
MATT: (laughs) What is your alignment?

4251
03:29:52,515 --> 03:29:55,238
ASHLEY: What is my alignment?
MATT: You should look at your sheet.

4252
03:29:55,238 --> 03:29:56,263
SAM: I don't remember.
I don't think it's on my sheet.

4253
03:29:56,263 --> 03:29:59,745
ORION: Can you just be good?

4254
03:29:59,745 --> 03:30:00,999
ASHLEY: It says chaotic good.

4255
03:30:00,999 --> 03:30:02,379
SAM: What should I be, Matt?

4256
03:30:02,379 --> 03:30:04,547
MATT: Okay. It's not so much required
to be lawful, like the older editions are,

4257
03:30:04,547 --> 03:30:08,030
but it depends on the deity you chose.

4258
03:30:08,030 --> 03:30:12,124
I'm still keeping an eye
on your actions in the game.

4259
03:30:12,124 --> 03:30:15,779
TALIESIN: There's so many.
I'm trying to pick one.

4260
03:30:15,779 --> 03:30:18,779
MATT: That crack in your thing
is still there.

4261
03:30:18,779 --> 03:30:21,663
ASHLEY: Wait, but maybe
the crack would get healed

4262
03:30:21,663 --> 03:30:23,403
because of my honesty roll.

4263
03:30:23,403 --> 03:30:26,882
SAM: Yeah, but that was a game thing.
That wasn't a character thing.

4264
03:30:26,882 --> 03:30:30,432
LAURA: No, that was definitely
a character thing.

4265
03:30:30,432 --> 03:30:32,367
LIAM: You've got a wicked streak.

4266
03:30:32,367 --> 03:30:33,245
ASHLEY: I've got a wicked streak, man.

4267
03:30:33,245 --> 03:30:34,131
MATT: We'll see how it plays out.

4268
03:30:34,131 --> 03:30:35,697
ASHLEY: (groans)

4269
03:30:35,697 --> 03:30:37,765
TALIESIN: This is like
trying to catch snowflakes.

4270
03:30:37,765 --> 03:30:39,038
LIAM: On a related note,

4271
03:30:39,038 --> 03:30:40,255
somebody wants you to say,
"fuck you, Dylan" for some reason.

4272
03:30:40,255 --> 03:30:41,380
ASHLEY: Fuck you, Dylan!

4273
03:30:41,380 --> 03:30:44,459
(all laugh)

4274
03:30:44,459 --> 03:30:46,114
TRAVIS: That was amazing, actually.
MATT: That was really good.

4275
03:30:46,114 --> 03:30:48,573
TRAVIS: That had
a lot of conviction behind it.

4276
03:30:48,573 --> 03:30:49,607
MARISHA: (laughs)

4277
03:30:49,607 --> 03:30:51,246
TRAVIS: "Liam, scoot in.
We can't see you."

4278
03:30:51,246 --> 03:30:53,447
MATT: Come in, buddy.
LIAM: Aww.

4279
03:30:53,447 --> 03:30:56,710
ORION: Scootch.
MARISHA: Is that better?

4280
03:30:56,710 --> 03:30:58,750
LAURA: Now we're all nice and cozy.

4281
03:30:58,750 --> 03:31:04,148
LIAM: Tiberius is chaotic inattentive?
It goes so fast!

4282
03:31:04,148 --> 03:31:05,942
LAURA: Wait a sec.
"Hey, guys, love the stream."

4283
03:31:05,942 --> 03:31:08,829
ZAC: They want to know
how you all got into voice acting.

4284
03:31:08,829 --> 03:31:10,816
LIAM: Hooking.
TRAVIS: Virgin sacrifice.

4285
03:31:10,816 --> 03:31:13,000
MATT: That's a long question.
SAM: How does anyone do anything?

4286
03:31:13,000 --> 03:31:14,230
MARISHA: It's a long story.

4287
03:31:14,230 --> 03:31:17,939
MATT: Training to be an actor,
and then pursuing the opportunities.

4288
03:31:17,939 --> 03:31:19,989
LIAM: And then you met the right person
while training to be an actor.

4289
03:31:19,989 --> 03:31:22,853
TALIESIN: Acting
with a desire for a bad haircut.

4290
03:31:22,853 --> 03:31:26,215
MARISHA: And the ability
to work in your pajamas.

4291
03:31:26,215 --> 03:31:28,970
LAURA: I can't read this fast.
It's too much.

4292
03:31:28,970 --> 03:31:30,694
SAM: A lot of stuff for Matt.

4293
03:31:30,694 --> 03:31:31,710
TRAVIS: Keyleth,
do you have a holy symbol?

4294
03:31:31,710 --> 03:31:34,743
MARISHA: Who? Me?
TRAVIS: Do you have a holy symbol?

4295
03:31:34,743 --> 03:31:37,440
MARISHA: I don't have a holy symbol.
Not a druid thing.

4296
03:31:37,440 --> 03:31:41,106
I like the earth.
I worship the earth. No deities.

4297
03:31:41,106 --> 03:31:47,438
LAURA: You can still trust Vex
after Dread. I'm not the same girl.

4298
03:31:47,438 --> 03:31:49,606
MATT: Whole different character.
LAURA: Whole different character.

4299
03:31:49,606 --> 03:31:52,369
TRAVIS: Are any of you guys
going to GenCon?

4300
03:31:52,369 --> 03:31:54,362
LIAM: When Geek &amp; Sundry arranges that.

4301
03:31:54,362 --> 03:31:56,659
MARISHA: Yeah, tell Geek &amp; Sundry
to take us there.

4302
03:31:56,659 --> 03:31:57,680
LAURA: Yeah,
we thought that would be fun.

4303
03:31:57,680 --> 03:31:59,681
ORION: Hit them up.
Tell them you want us there.

4304
03:31:59,681 --> 03:32:01,683
SAM: I do not think
I look like Tim Curry.

4305
03:32:01,683 --> 03:32:06,516
(all laugh)

4306
03:32:06,516 --> 03:32:08,392
LIAM: With the beard, you did.

4307
03:32:08,392 --> 03:32:10,006
MATT: Yeah, I can see that
a little bit.

4308
03:32:10,006 --> 03:32:11,456
TRAVIS: That's a good one!
Did any of you grow up shy?

4309
03:32:11,456 --> 03:32:13,163
LAURA: Yes.
MATT AND TALIESIN: No.

4310
03:32:13,163 --> 03:32:14,504
LIAM: Yeah.

4311
03:32:14,504 --> 03:32:16,448
MATT: I was a ham.

4312
03:32:16,448 --> 03:32:17,941
TALIESIN: I was a working actor.

4313
03:32:17,941 --> 03:32:19,501
MATT: Oh, yeah, you were a child actor.
You're like,

4314
03:32:19,501 --> 03:32:21,001
"oh, I was working with Spielberg
when I was six."

4315
03:32:21,001 --> 03:32:22,578
LAURA: You were a child actor, too.

4316
03:32:22,578 --> 03:32:25,578
LIAM: I was a spaz. I was so shy.

4317
03:32:25,578 --> 03:32:28,769
I'm going to be blind as that manta ray
by the time this Q&amp;A is over!

4318
03:32:28,769 --> 03:32:31,728
MATT: As a note, guys.
For those of you that have seen Mr. Mom?

4319
03:32:31,728 --> 03:32:32,464
TALIESIN: Oh, god.

4320
03:32:32,464 --> 03:32:34,122
MATT: The little kid with the woobie?

4321
03:32:34,122 --> 03:32:35,832
LIAM: The woobie. He's right over here.

4322
03:32:35,832 --> 03:32:37,336
TALIESIN: This is how
everything goes wrong.

4323
03:32:37,336 --> 03:32:38,553
This is what happens.

4324
03:32:38,553 --> 03:32:39,926
ASHLEY: I'm going to re-watch that.

4325
03:32:39,926 --> 03:32:42,726
LIAM: This goes right.
We're playing D&amp;D once a week!

4326
03:32:42,726 --> 03:32:45,998
Any interest in turning Critical Role
into a comic book? Yes.

4327
03:32:45,998 --> 03:32:48,363
Who will draw it, from the chat room?

4328
03:32:48,363 --> 03:32:50,063
MATT: Yeah, that would be amazing.

4329
03:32:50,063 --> 03:32:52,422
If anyone out there wants to make it
a comic book, that would be great!

4330
03:32:52,422 --> 03:32:54,897
TRAVIS: Tiberius, would you say,
"I encourage violence"?

4331
03:32:54,897 --> 03:32:56,527
ORION: When I want to.

4332
03:32:56,527 --> 03:32:59,958
LAURA: (gasps) I just saw one that said,
"Laura, would you like

4333
03:32:59,958 --> 03:33:02,396
"a giant Trinket plushie
to sit at the table with me?" And yes.

4334
03:33:02,396 --> 03:33:05,081
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: I would.

4335
03:33:05,081 --> 03:33:07,087
LIAM: Like an FAO Schwarz-size bear?

4336
03:33:07,087 --> 03:33:09,272
TALIESIN: She might actually cry.
LAURA: Dude, that would be amazing.

4337
03:33:09,272 --> 03:33:12,174
MATT: Someone asked,
how did we all get into D&amp;D?

4338
03:33:12,174 --> 03:33:13,025
High school, for me.

4339
03:33:13,025 --> 03:33:13,949
TALIESIN: High school.
LIAM: High school.

4340
03:33:13,949 --> 03:33:15,555
LAURA: These guys.
TRAVIS: This.

4341
03:33:15,555 --> 03:33:16,698
MATT: For most everyone else, this.

4342
03:33:16,698 --> 03:33:18,757
SAM: This is my first time playing.

4343
03:33:18,757 --> 03:33:20,015
TRAVIS: Liam's birthday party.

4344
03:33:20,015 --> 03:33:22,300
LIAM: Either high school
or my birthday two and a half years ago.

4345
03:33:22,300 --> 03:33:24,568
It was my birthday request
to play a one-off,

4346
03:33:24,568 --> 03:33:26,226
and it turned into this.

4347
03:33:26,226 --> 03:33:27,760
MATT: Yeah. This is Liam's fault.

4348
03:33:27,760 --> 03:33:33,098
MARISHA: My first game was with you,
but then I've done other games since

4349
03:33:33,098 --> 03:33:34,262
and I came back for this one.

4350
03:33:34,262 --> 03:33:35,676
TALIESIN: I had played other games
before you,

4351
03:33:35,676 --> 03:33:41,083
but had never really experienced
the sensation of playing D&amp;D.

4352
03:33:41,083 --> 03:33:43,361
This was a whole-- there were levels
that were reached

4353
03:33:43,361 --> 03:33:44,855
that had never been reached before.

4354
03:33:44,855 --> 03:33:47,108
MARISHA: I've had
some frustrating DMs, too.

4355
03:33:47,108 --> 03:33:49,620
MATT: It happens.

4356
03:33:49,620 --> 03:33:50,552
SAM: Who's the youngest?

4357
03:33:50,552 --> 03:33:51,847
LAURA: Who's the youngest?

4358
03:33:51,847 --> 03:33:53,140
LIAM: Not me.
TALIESIN: Not me.

4359
03:33:53,140 --> 03:33:53,640
LAURA: Marisha?

4360
03:33:53,640 --> 03:33:55,453
SAM: Probably Marisha. She's, like, 16.

4361
03:33:55,453 --> 03:33:56,831
LIAM: I'm the oldest.

4362
03:33:56,831 --> 03:33:59,435
MARISHA: In Los Angeles, there is no age,
only age "rages."

4363
03:33:59,435 --> 03:34:00,326
TRAVIS: "Age rages?"

4364
03:34:00,326 --> 03:34:01,871
MARISHA: Age rages.

4365
03:34:01,871 --> 03:34:02,957
TRAVIS AND TALIESIN:
I would like to age rage.

4366
03:34:02,957 --> 03:34:03,637
(all laugh)

4367
03:34:03,637 --> 03:34:05,556
MARISHA: I would like to age rage.

4368
03:34:05,556 --> 03:34:07,882
SAM: I think I'm the oldest.

4369
03:34:07,882 --> 03:34:11,572
LIAM: No. I'm the oldest.

4370
03:34:11,572 --> 03:34:12,469
LAURA: Oh, my old brother.

4371
03:34:12,469 --> 03:34:13,553
LIAM: Light!
ORION: (laughs)

4372
03:34:13,553 --> 03:34:14,633
MARISHA: (sing-song) I will never tell.

4373
03:34:14,633 --> 03:34:16,171
ORION: Tiberius isn't old.

4374
03:34:16,171 --> 03:34:19,787
LIAM: No, I know that.
You're an old soul.

4375
03:34:19,787 --> 03:34:21,105
I'm May 28th, and you're when?

4376
03:34:21,105 --> 03:34:21,865
SAM: October 9th.

4377
03:34:21,865 --> 03:34:24,943
TALIESIN: Wait, how old are you?
SAM: 38.

4378
03:34:24,943 --> 03:34:25,575
TALIESIN: I'm 38!

4379
03:34:25,575 --> 03:34:26,755
SAM: When's your birthday?

4380
03:34:26,755 --> 03:34:28,054
TALIESIN: January 19th. I'm the oldest!

4381
03:34:28,054 --> 03:34:31,146
LIAM: What month?
TALIESIN: January.

4382
03:34:31,146 --> 03:34:31,846
MATT: Hold on.

4383
03:34:31,846 --> 03:34:33,037
MARISHA: I'm 18 to 30.

4384
03:34:33,037 --> 03:34:35,008
ORION: I don't care; I'll just keep going.

4385
03:34:35,008 --> 03:34:38,193
Wizards who do magic,
they have to pick it every day.

4386
03:34:38,193 --> 03:34:39,644
Sorcerers invoke it.

4387
03:34:39,644 --> 03:34:44,585
They learn it from their being
and they cast it out that way.

4388
03:34:44,585 --> 03:34:46,983
The character Tiberius,
figuring him out,

4389
03:34:46,983 --> 03:34:50,924
that predicted which way I went

4390
03:34:50,924 --> 03:34:57,594
because I feel he would
just have it within him to do.

4391
03:34:57,594 --> 03:35:02,271
The whole thing is,
he's the Keyser Soze of the group,

4392
03:35:02,271 --> 03:35:05,309
in a way,
where he's the false buffoon,

4393
03:35:05,309 --> 03:35:06,698
but he knows exactly what he's doing

4394
03:35:06,698 --> 03:35:10,958
when it comes to a battle
and other particular things.

4395
03:35:10,958 --> 03:35:12,323
MATT: Yeah. Awesome.

4396
03:35:12,323 --> 03:35:15,035
TALIESIN: January 19th
is an awesome birthday. Yes, thank you.

4397
03:35:15,035 --> 03:35:18,849
MATT: Question: "how do we send you shit?"
Talk to Overlord.

4398
03:35:18,849 --> 03:35:20,168
TALIESIN: Probably in a bag.

4399
03:35:20,168 --> 03:35:21,558
LAURA: Don't send us shit.
MATT: Small boxes of shit.

4400
03:35:21,558 --> 03:35:22,625
ZAC: DM the Overlord!

4401
03:35:22,625 --> 03:35:23,402
ORION: (English accent)
We don't want no poo.

4402
03:35:23,402 --> 03:35:24,077
MATT: DM the Overlord

4403
03:35:24,077 --> 03:35:28,201
for where to send
your boxes full of fecal matter.

4404
03:35:28,201 --> 03:35:30,871
ZAC: Thanks, Matt.
Thanks so fucking much!

4405
03:35:30,871 --> 03:35:33,552
MATT: (laughs)

4406
03:35:33,552 --> 03:35:34,724
ZAC: That's all I need.

4407
03:35:34,724 --> 03:35:38,312
They will send me fecal matter,
and it's on you.

4408
03:35:38,312 --> 03:35:40,396
LIAM: I think someone asked
about my birthay.

4409
03:35:40,396 --> 03:35:41,551
Laura and my birthday.

4410
03:35:41,551 --> 03:35:45,265
The whole reason we are playing twins
is that we share the same birthday.

4411
03:35:45,265 --> 03:35:46,320
LAURA: We are twins!

4412
03:35:46,320 --> 03:35:48,445
LIAM: It's May 28th.
LAURA: What, what!

4413
03:35:48,445 --> 03:35:50,244
MARISHA: May birthdays!

4414
03:35:50,244 --> 03:35:52,480
LIAM: She's older than me, though.
LAURA: No, I'm not.

4415
03:35:52,480 --> 03:35:53,428
TALIESIN: I can't read this,
it's actually hurting--

4416
03:35:53,428 --> 03:35:54,438
TRAVIS: I'm having
a motherfucking aneurysm.

4417
03:35:54,438 --> 03:35:57,353
MARISHA: I know,
you're going to get motion sick--

4418
03:35:57,353 --> 03:35:59,973
MATT: I know. Real fast,
a note to all you guys,

4419
03:35:59,973 --> 03:36:03,075
because Travis and Laura
have a vacation planned in two weeks.

4420
03:36:03,075 --> 03:36:04,906
Depending on where we are in the game,

4421
03:36:04,906 --> 03:36:07,370
if the party's about to go in
to fight K'Varn

4422
03:36:07,370 --> 03:36:10,167
and then they have to leave
the following week,

4423
03:36:10,167 --> 03:36:11,690
we might actually take a week off

4424
03:36:11,690 --> 03:36:16,362
and instead do a three-hour hangout
and answer questions,

4425
03:36:16,362 --> 03:36:19,199
and I might go over teaching people
how to play the game,

4426
03:36:19,199 --> 03:36:21,088
because we don't want to do a boss fight
without two of our party.

4427
03:36:21,088 --> 03:36:23,370
So just as a heads-up,
that might be something that happens.

4428
03:36:23,370 --> 03:36:24,294
LAURA: Sorry, guys.
MATT: We'll figure it out.

4429
03:36:24,294 --> 03:36:26,583
ORION: Somebody wanted you
to say something as Trey.

4430
03:36:26,583 --> 03:36:29,078
MATT: (laughs) As Trey?

4431
03:36:29,078 --> 03:36:29,428
ORION: Yeah.

4432
03:36:29,428 --> 03:36:31,191
That's what these shirts are,
by the way.

4433
03:36:31,191 --> 03:36:32,803
These are from Type-0,
the thing that we're in.

4434
03:36:32,803 --> 03:36:34,704
MATT: "I hope
you've enjoyed your game tonight,

4435
03:36:34,704 --> 03:36:36,674
"and if you have any questions,
please feel free

4436
03:36:36,674 --> 03:36:39,154
"to put them on the screen. Thank you."

4437
03:36:39,154 --> 03:36:40,483
ORION: "Pay attention, yo."

4438
03:36:40,483 --> 03:36:41,820
TALIESIN: I saw VentralMalcavian.
I actually, in high school,

4439
03:36:41,820 --> 03:36:44,658
played the Malcavian prince
of Los Angeles.

4440
03:36:44,658 --> 03:36:45,627
It was fabulous.

4441
03:36:45,627 --> 03:36:46,422
MARISHA: Oh, that's amazing.

4442
03:36:46,422 --> 03:36:48,941
TALIESIN: Malcavian all the way.
It was magical.

4443
03:36:48,941 --> 03:36:50,167
MARISHA: That's awesome.

4444
03:36:50,167 --> 03:36:50,940
LIAM: I want to know the answer
to one someone asked.

4445
03:36:50,940 --> 03:36:52,952
"How did Travis and Laura meet?"

4446
03:36:52,952 --> 03:36:55,781
ALL: Aww.
LAURA: Adorable.

4447
03:36:55,781 --> 03:36:56,815
TRAVIS: Oh, back in Dallas.

4448
03:36:56,815 --> 03:37:00,741
Like, right out of high school,
we were in the same talent agency.

4449
03:37:00,741 --> 03:37:04,185
LAURA: We did a job as extras together
on a set.

4450
03:37:04,185 --> 03:37:05,613
TRAVIS: With the silent extra talk.

4451
03:37:05,613 --> 03:37:07,140
[no audio]

4452
03:37:07,140 --> 03:37:08,493
LIAM: Were you good?

4453
03:37:08,493 --> 03:37:10,333
MARISHA: Oh, did you guys
do that on camera? That's so cute.

4454
03:37:10,333 --> 03:37:11,756
LAURA: We sat for 8 hours
at the same table,

4455
03:37:11,756 --> 03:37:14,738
and we couldn't talk to each other
because we weren't allowed to make noise.

4456
03:37:14,738 --> 03:37:18,471
TRAVIS: We thought we were superstars.
LAURA: Yeah, we thought we were so cool.

4457
03:37:18,471 --> 03:37:20,366
TRAVIS: "This is the greatest job ever".

4458
03:37:20,366 --> 03:37:24,254
LAURA: And then just started hanging out
in the same circles, and that was that.

4459
03:37:24,254 --> 03:37:25,007
ASHLEY: The rest is history?

4460
03:37:25,007 --> 03:37:28,496
TRAVIS: She totally fell for me.

4461
03:37:28,496 --> 03:37:30,754
ORION: That's adorable.
MARISHA: It's adorable.

4462
03:37:30,754 --> 03:37:34,972
SAM: Someone asked many questions.

4463
03:37:34,972 --> 03:37:36,521
"When did Pike and Scanlan
start flirting?"

4464
03:37:36,521 --> 03:37:38,431
Or, "When did Scanlan
start flirting with Pike?"

4465
03:37:38,431 --> 03:37:40,146
Right from the beginning.

4466
03:37:40,146 --> 03:37:41,165
TRAVIS: (laughing) Yeah, no joke.

4467
03:37:41,165 --> 03:37:45,499
LAURA: Yes, like literally
the moment Pike was in the game.

4468
03:37:45,499 --> 03:37:47,029
SAM: Donatello's my favorite Ninja Turtle.

4469
03:37:47,029 --> 03:37:50,045
LIAM: Sam is my favorite Ninja Turtle.
ORION: Mine, too.

4470
03:37:50,045 --> 03:37:52,940
LAURA: Donatello 
is my favorite Ninja Turtle.

4471
03:37:52,940 --> 03:37:56,465
SAM: Advice for bards
is sing loud, and sing proud.

4472
03:37:56,465 --> 03:37:58,472
Or play your flute or whatever.

4473
03:37:58,472 --> 03:38:01,664
LIAM: That's more commonly known as
"rock out with your cock out."

4474
03:38:01,664 --> 03:38:02,819
TALIESIN: Someone now asked
how you two met, now, too.

4475
03:38:02,819 --> 03:38:04,323
MARISHA: People are now asking
how we met.

4476
03:38:04,323 --> 03:38:04,844
SAM: Bard out with your heart out.

4477
03:38:04,844 --> 03:38:05,864
ORION: Bard out with your heart out.

4478
03:38:05,864 --> 03:38:08,301
MATT: Me and Marisha met--
a mutual friend of ours

4479
03:38:08,301 --> 03:38:10,487
was putting together
a sketch-writing group--

4480
03:38:10,487 --> 03:38:11,935
this was years ago.

4481
03:38:11,935 --> 03:38:16,106
MARISHA: It was supposed to be SNL,
but geeky, nerdy stuff

4482
03:38:16,106 --> 03:38:19,375
where we were going to write
and perform our own sketches.

4483
03:38:19,375 --> 03:38:20,751
MATT: Those never pan out.

4484
03:38:20,751 --> 03:38:21,316
MARISHA: That never happened.

4485
03:38:21,316 --> 03:38:22,305
MATT: Not in L.A.
MARISHA: Yeah.

4486
03:38:22,305 --> 03:38:23,311
TALIESIN: (laughs)

4487
03:38:23,311 --> 03:38:25,052
MATT: But we met there,

4488
03:38:25,052 --> 03:38:26,835
we harbored secret crushes
for about a year,

4489
03:38:26,835 --> 03:38:29,683
and then when we reconnected
a little over a year later,

4490
03:38:29,683 --> 03:38:33,353
I was out of a relationship,
and she was just getting out of one,

4491
03:38:33,353 --> 03:38:36,181
and we both started talking again.
And then eventually we were like,

4492
03:38:36,181 --> 03:38:37,679
"Hey, this is cool.
We should do this."

4493
03:38:37,679 --> 03:38:40,042
MARISHA: You got me an audition
for Resident Evil.

4494
03:38:40,042 --> 03:38:40,482
MATT: Yeah.

4495
03:38:40,482 --> 03:38:42,535
MARISHA: And then I was like,
"I owe you a drink."

4496
03:38:42,535 --> 03:38:45,214
LAURA: Is that the Resident Evil
we worked on together?

4497
03:38:45,214 --> 03:38:48,289
TALIESIN: He was adorable.
It was so adorable watching him. Oh, god.

4498
03:38:48,289 --> 03:38:48,985
MATT: It was for Damnation,
the CG movie.

4499
03:38:48,985 --> 03:38:51,230
LAURA: Oh, okay. I did that, too.
MATT: Yeah.

4500
03:38:51,230 --> 03:38:52,429
MARISHA: Yeah.

4501
03:38:52,429 --> 03:38:55,740
TALIESIN: Back when we had a karaoke bar
that we went to.

4502
03:38:55,740 --> 03:38:57,711
I miss our karaoke bar.

4503
03:38:57,711 --> 03:39:02,084
TRAVIS: Do you ever want to be a player
and not a DM?

4504
03:39:02,084 --> 03:39:05,687
MATT: I do. It doesn't happen often.
At all. But that's okay.

4505
03:39:05,687 --> 03:39:06,767
TALIESIN: He's so good!

4506
03:39:06,767 --> 03:39:08,354
MATT: I'll have the opportunity.

4507
03:39:08,354 --> 03:39:11,298
LIAM: "Will Critical Role continue
after the boss?" Yes.

4508
03:39:11,298 --> 03:39:12,750
LAURA: Yeah!
MATT AND TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

4509
03:39:12,750 --> 03:39:13,730
SAM: No! We're all going to die!

4510
03:39:13,730 --> 03:39:15,868
MATT: (laughs)

4511
03:39:15,868 --> 03:39:17,020
TRAVIS: "Zac, what was
the most recent picture

4512
03:39:17,020 --> 03:39:18,117
you shared with the community?"

4513
03:39:18,117 --> 03:39:21,239
Somebody is asking to see it.
Or asking me to ask you to see it.

4514
03:39:21,239 --> 03:39:25,061
ZAC: Oh, I'll show you later.
It's inappropriate.

4515
03:39:25,061 --> 03:39:28,936
SAM: Oh, yes, guys, by the way.
Ashley and I are dating in real life.

4516
03:39:28,936 --> 03:39:30,891
ORION: Do they ship you?

4517
03:39:30,891 --> 03:39:34,422
SAM: Yeah, no, we've been together
for a couple of years now.

4518
03:39:34,422 --> 03:39:38,450
TRAVIS: Yeah, like, 40 years.
ASHLEY: 40-something years now.

4519
03:39:38,450 --> 03:39:40,017
TALIESIN: On and off.
SAM: It feels like it.

4520
03:39:40,017 --> 03:39:43,068
TALIESIN: On and off.
ASHLEY: On and off.

4521
03:39:43,068 --> 03:39:44,836
TALIESIN: Drama. Just drama.

4522
03:39:44,836 --> 03:39:45,451
ASHLEY: It's a long time. You lose track--

4523
03:39:45,451 --> 03:39:46,893
LIAM: If you replace Ashley with Liam,
it's true.

4524
03:39:46,893 --> 03:39:49,225
TRAVIS: "Pike, does Scanlan have a shot?"

4525
03:39:49,225 --> 03:39:49,828
ASHLEY: I don't know; we'll see.

4526
03:39:49,828 --> 03:39:51,312
MATT: "Do you guys
have backup characters rolled

4527
03:39:51,312 --> 03:39:52,136
"for when you get TPK'd?"

4528
03:39:52,136 --> 03:39:53,058
SAM: "We'll see?"
Come on, give me a hint!

4529
03:39:53,058 --> 03:39:53,696
LIAM: I've got an idea.

4530
03:39:53,696 --> 03:39:55,454
LAURA: Aw, I saw,
how did me and Trinket become friends?

4531
03:39:55,454 --> 03:39:56,827
TALIESIN: That's dark, people!
That's really dark!

4532
03:39:56,827 --> 03:39:57,885
LIAM: That's a good one!

4533
03:39:57,885 --> 03:40:00,683
TRAVIS: How did you and Trinket
become friends?

4534
03:40:00,683 --> 03:40:02,760
LAURA: Okay, it's kind of a long story.
LIAM: Yeah, go for it.

4535
03:40:02,760 --> 03:40:05,103
MARISHA: Wait, you and Trinket?
LAURA: Me and Trinket.

4536
03:40:05,103 --> 03:40:06,540
MARISHA: Yeah, I want to hear it.

4537
03:40:06,540 --> 03:40:11,672
LAURA: I sent this short story to Matt--
what was it, a year ago?

4538
03:40:11,672 --> 03:40:16,365
I just wanted him to know
why Trinket was so special to me.

4539
03:40:16,365 --> 03:40:17,368
It's such a dorky thing.

4540
03:40:17,368 --> 03:40:20,794
LIAM: It really is a short story
and not a blurb. It was long.

4541
03:40:20,794 --> 03:40:23,210
LAURA: It was a long thing.
And it was all about,

4542
03:40:23,210 --> 03:40:29,749
shortly after me and my brother
left our family of the elves

4543
03:40:29,749 --> 03:40:31,609
and we were setting off on our own

4544
03:40:31,609 --> 03:40:34,189
and he was off in the city
and I was making camp outside of town,

4545
03:40:34,189 --> 03:40:39,452
these people came into the camp
and basically I trusted them too much,

4546
03:40:39,452 --> 03:40:40,959
they kidnapped me
and brought me back to their camp.

4547
03:40:40,959 --> 03:40:44,118
And they were poachers
on the black market.

4548
03:40:44,118 --> 03:40:50,299
And I was in a cage and I could hear
a large creature in pain,

4549
03:40:50,299 --> 03:40:54,186
and through my own wiles
I got out of the cage,

4550
03:40:54,186 --> 03:40:57,866
took out the two hunters,
and I went to see what animal it was,

4551
03:40:57,866 --> 03:41:00,981
and it was a giant bear
in a lot of pain.

4552
03:41:00,981 --> 03:41:03,990
Unfortunately, it had been cut open
from the middle,

4553
03:41:03,990 --> 03:41:07,929
they had been harvesting the bear
but they hadn't killed it,

4554
03:41:07,929 --> 03:41:11,644
and it was really sad,
so I felt terrible for it,

4555
03:41:11,644 --> 03:41:16,531
and I put it out of its misery
and felt really bad about it.

4556
03:41:16,531 --> 03:41:21,479
And then I heard off to the side,
a small animal make noise,

4557
03:41:21,479 --> 03:41:23,241
and I realized it was its cub.

4558
03:41:23,241 --> 03:41:26,416
ALL: No!

4559
03:41:26,416 --> 03:41:30,031
LAURA: So I took the cub
and I felt really horrible,

4560
03:41:30,031 --> 03:41:33,301
and that was also my first time
I'd ever killed any people, as well,

4561
03:41:33,301 --> 03:41:37,720
so Trinket was very special to me
because I wanted to protect him

4562
03:41:37,720 --> 03:41:41,411
and not let him experience that again.

4563
03:41:41,411 --> 03:41:42,110
ASHLEY: Trinket.

4564
03:41:42,110 --> 03:41:42,467
TRAVIS: Did you eat the cub?

4565
03:41:42,467 --> 03:41:44,203
LAURA: I didn't eat the cub!
I saved the cub!

4566
03:41:44,203 --> 03:41:45,462
TRAVIS: Oh, the cub is Trinket.

4567
03:41:45,462 --> 03:41:47,322
LAURA: And I have never
even told anybody about that.

4568
03:41:47,322 --> 03:41:52,573
I never told Vax about that,
or anything. So Trinket was mine.

4569
03:41:52,573 --> 03:41:54,323
ALL: Aw.
MATT: That's really cute.

4570
03:41:54,323 --> 03:41:55,591
MARISHA: Trinket.
LAURA: Yeah.

4571
03:41:55,591 --> 03:41:57,841
TALIESIN: Bear love.
ORION: Also adorable.

4572
03:41:57,841 --> 03:41:58,860
ASHLEY: Trinket!

4573
03:41:58,860 --> 03:42:00,170
TALIESIN: Someone mentioned

4574
03:42:00,170 --> 03:42:02,951
we should bring Jennifer Hale
on the show as a guest.

4575
03:42:02,951 --> 03:42:04,742
LAURA: Ooh, she'd be pretty great.
TALIESIN: That would be hot.

4576
03:42:04,742 --> 03:42:06,202
MATT: That would be interesting.

4577
03:42:06,202 --> 03:42:08,275
LIAM: There's a short list for guests,
and a long lists for guests,

4578
03:42:08,275 --> 03:42:09,835
for down the road.

4579
03:42:09,835 --> 03:42:10,831
MATT: Yeah, we're going to have
some fun people jumping in

4580
03:42:10,831 --> 03:42:12,056
for a few weeks here and there.

4581
03:42:12,056 --> 03:42:15,041
SAM: George Clooney, anybody?
LIAM: Carrot Top.

4582
03:42:15,041 --> 03:42:19,042
SAM AND LAURA: Carrot Top, anybody?

4583
03:42:19,042 --> 03:42:22,334
ASHLEY: Why do I have food in my hair?

4584
03:42:22,334 --> 03:42:24,860
MATT: Because you're doing it right!

4585
03:42:24,860 --> 03:42:27,449
ASHLEY: Anyway, who would you guys
like to see play D&amp;D with us?

4586
03:42:27,449 --> 03:42:28,667
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

4587
03:42:28,667 --> 03:42:30,738
TRAVIS: There we go,
watch this thing light up.

4588
03:42:30,738 --> 03:42:31,863
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's a good question.

4589
03:42:31,863 --> 03:42:33,113
LAURA: I'm seeing that
"expect a crochet Trinket."

4590
03:42:33,113 --> 03:42:34,588
I appreciate that. Thank you.

4591
03:42:34,588 --> 03:42:35,414
SAM: Let's wait two minutes
until the feed catches up.

4592
03:42:35,414 --> 03:42:37,751
TALIESIN: Ashly Burch.
LAURA AND TRAVIS: Stephen Colbert.

4593
03:42:37,751 --> 03:42:40,499
LAURA: Barack Obama!
TRAVIS AND LIAM: Barack Obama.

4594
03:42:40,499 --> 03:42:43,868
ASHLEY: I don't know
if we can get Barack Obama, you guys.

4595
03:42:43,868 --> 03:42:45,858
TALIESIN: I don't know
if we can get Ashly Burch. That's tough.

4596
03:42:45,858 --> 03:42:46,938
SAM: Oh, not the president Barack Obama,
some other guy.

4597
03:42:46,938 --> 03:42:48,738
TALIESIN: George Takei!
LAURA: Wil Wheaton.

4598
03:42:48,738 --> 03:42:51,449
TALIESIN: Steve Blum, Troy Baker.
LAURA: Tom Hiddleston.

4599
03:42:51,449 --> 03:42:53,057
LIAM: Tim Burton?
TALIESIN: Vin Diesel.

4600
03:42:53,057 --> 03:42:55,000
ORION: (laughs) Tim Burton?
MATT: I love Vin Diesel.

4601
03:42:55,000 --> 03:42:58,286
MARISHA: Hardwick. Vin Diesel!
MATT: We're working on Hardwick.

4602
03:42:58,286 --> 03:43:00,524
LIAM: My eyes are bleeding!
TALIESIN: Claudia Black.

4603
03:43:00,524 --> 03:43:02,954
LAURA: So many!
SAM: (deep voice) Jon Snow!

4604
03:43:02,954 --> 03:43:04,460
LIAM: Eliza Dushku. 
TRAVIS: There's a Laura emote!

4605
03:43:04,460 --> 03:43:06,585
LIAM: Elijah Wood.
LAURA: There is?! There's a me emote?

4606
03:43:06,585 --> 03:43:09,611
MATT: A lot of the people
you guys have mentioned,

4607
03:43:09,611 --> 03:43:10,491
we're actually talking to.

4608
03:43:10,491 --> 03:43:11,667
I'm going to talk to Nathan,
I'm going to talk to Chris--

4609
03:43:11,667 --> 03:43:13,158
LAURA: We're talking to Vin Diesel.

4610
03:43:13,158 --> 03:43:14,448
SAM: Garfunkel and Oates, yeah.

4611
03:43:14,448 --> 03:43:15,589
MATT: We don't know
if they're available.

4612
03:43:15,589 --> 03:43:16,982
TALIESIN: Garfunkel and Oates
would be amazing.

4613
03:43:16,982 --> 03:43:18,306
MARISHA: That would be hilarious.
ASHLEY: That would be great.

4614
03:43:18,306 --> 03:43:19,524
SAM: Bards. They could be bards!

4615
03:43:19,524 --> 03:43:21,479
MATT: Dame Judy Dench? Yeah.

4616
03:43:21,479 --> 03:43:24,703
MARISHA: Steve Blum.
SAM: Troy Baker? I don't know.

4617
03:43:24,703 --> 03:43:26,176
LAURA: Who is that?
SAM: Sasha Gray.

4618
03:43:26,176 --> 03:43:28,845
LIAM: Pfft.
SAM: Troy Baker.

4619
03:43:28,845 --> 03:43:29,685
ASHLEY: Sasha Gray?

4620
03:43:29,685 --> 03:43:30,205
TALIESIN: I'd play with them.
That'd be awesome.

4621
03:43:30,205 --> 03:43:31,210
ASHLEY: Sasha Gray is a...?
SAM: Porn star, yeah.

4622
03:43:31,210 --> 03:43:33,188
LIAM: Troy didn't know
what to make of this

4623
03:43:33,188 --> 03:43:33,821
when we first started it.

4624
03:43:33,821 --> 03:43:34,853
MATT: Yeah. I think he still
doesn't to know what to make of it.

4625
03:43:34,853 --> 03:43:36,353
LAURA: Actually, no, you know what,

4626
03:43:36,353 --> 03:43:37,628
I've had conversations
with Troy about it--

4627
03:43:37,628 --> 03:43:38,913
TALIESIN: Peter Dinklage.

4628
03:43:38,913 --> 03:43:39,814
ASHLEY: Peter Dinklage
is on my hall pass list.

4629
03:43:39,814 --> 03:43:41,405
LAURA: I don't think
he'd be opposed to joining the game.

4630
03:43:41,405 --> 03:43:42,828
MATT: Really?

4631
03:43:42,828 --> 03:43:44,660
LAURA: Yeah, he seemed very interested
when he brought it up.

4632
03:43:44,660 --> 03:43:45,955
TALIESIN: Sir Ian McKellen.

4633
03:43:45,955 --> 03:43:48,529
MATT: Because my first conversation
with him about it was very brief

4634
03:43:48,529 --> 03:43:52,253
and very much like, "Cool."
I was like, "Okay..."

4635
03:43:52,253 --> 03:43:53,324
LAURA: I think because me and Travis
were so excited about it--

4636
03:43:53,324 --> 03:43:55,019
MATT: Probably.
LAURA: It grew on him.

4637
03:43:55,019 --> 03:43:57,512
MATT: Yeah, we'll drag him in it sometime.
LAURA: Yeah.

4638
03:43:57,512 --> 03:44:00,077
TALIESIN: Wow, this is an amazing--

4639
03:44:00,077 --> 03:44:02,724
LAURA: Matt Oswalt,
that would be such a fun guest!

4640
03:44:02,724 --> 03:44:04,302
MATT: Danny Sexbang, yeah.
MARISHA: Eminem.

4641
03:44:04,302 --> 03:44:08,261
TRAVIS: If Grog comes across his uncle,
yes, he would definitely want to kill him.

4642
03:44:08,261 --> 03:44:09,864
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

4643
03:44:09,864 --> 03:44:11,391
TRAVIS: Bad relationship.

4644
03:44:11,391 --> 03:44:12,298
TALIESIN: You've had a little--
MARISHA: We've had a run-in, once--

4645
03:44:12,298 --> 03:44:13,654
TALIESIN: We've had a run-in
with the family once--

4646
03:44:13,654 --> 03:44:14,714
TRAVIS: With his son, yeah. My cousin.

4647
03:44:14,714 --> 03:44:17,526
TALIESIN: Yeah. That was the only time
you actually--

4648
03:44:17,526 --> 03:44:20,282
TRAVIS: Let him go?
TALIESIN: Deflated a conflict.

4649
03:44:20,282 --> 03:44:23,099
TRAVIS: Yeah, well.
MATT: Yeah, you stopped the fight.

4650
03:44:23,099 --> 03:44:25,464
TRAVIS: My childhood affection
was the only thing that let him live.

4651
03:44:25,484 --> 03:44:26,288
MATT: It was amazing.

4652
03:44:26,288 --> 03:44:27,681
TRAVIS: But if we see him again,
maybe a different outcome.

4653
03:44:27,681 --> 03:44:30,125
SAM: Hey, I have a question.
I have a question for the DM.

4654
03:44:30,125 --> 03:44:32,960
Is there a spell or a portal
or anything out there

4655
03:44:32,960 --> 03:44:38,410
where we can all switch bodies
with each other?

4656
03:44:38,410 --> 03:44:43,475
And I'm Keyleth for a while,
and Taliesin is Grog for a while?

4657
03:44:43,475 --> 03:44:44,470
LIAM: What is this, an anime episode?

4658
03:44:44,470 --> 03:44:46,134
SAM: I don't know, it could be cool!

4659
03:44:46,134 --> 03:44:48,878
MATT: (laughs) There are artifacts
that can do similar effects, yes.

4660
03:44:48,878 --> 03:44:49,884
LAURA: What?
SAM: I want to do that.

4661
03:44:49,884 --> 03:44:51,394
MATT: Like soul transfers
and stuff like that.

4662
03:44:51,394 --> 03:44:54,118
LAURA: That just seems messed up.
MARISHA: Soul transfers?

4663
03:44:54,118 --> 03:44:56,061
TALIESIN: So would I be Grog, then?
MARISHA: No.

4664
03:44:56,132 --> 03:44:58,825
SAM: You would rage.
TALIESIN: It would just be me as Grog.

4665
03:44:58,825 --> 03:45:01,585
LIAM: Someone requested as a player,
Zac Eubank.

4666
03:45:01,585 --> 03:45:04,613
SAM: I've heard of him.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4667
03:45:04,613 --> 03:45:05,880
MATT: Probably try that guy
in something.

4668
03:45:05,880 --> 03:45:06,369
LIAM: Zac, did you type that?

4669
03:45:06,369 --> 03:45:07,945
ZAC: I would really hate
to steal the show, guys.

4670
03:45:07,945 --> 03:45:09,401
(all laugh)

4671
03:45:09,401 --> 03:45:13,012
MARISHA: I don't think
I've seen you stand up so fast.

4672
03:45:13,012 --> 03:45:14,502
TALIESIN: We could have
some kind of Freaky Friday.

4673
03:45:14,502 --> 03:45:16,414
MATT: Oh, this is a good question.
"What if a party member dies?

4674
03:45:16,414 --> 03:45:18,026
"Do we have to scratch out
the name on the shirt?"

4675
03:45:18,026 --> 03:45:20,095
SAM: You could buy a new shirt.

4676
03:45:20,095 --> 03:45:24,584
MATT: You're welcome to.
It's a possibility.

4677
03:45:24,584 --> 03:45:28,458
There are magics that can,
through challenge, reverse death,

4678
03:45:28,458 --> 03:45:30,376
but death is definitely a possibility

4679
03:45:30,376 --> 03:45:32,505
and permanent death
is definitely a possibility.

4680
03:45:32,505 --> 03:45:34,272
LIAM: Somebody's going to die eventually.
MATT: It's probably going to happen.

4681
03:45:34,272 --> 03:45:35,477
TRAVIS: Why are you asking the DM?
Don't put ideas in his head.

4682
03:45:35,477 --> 03:45:37,789
ASHLEY: It's possible that will happen.

4683
03:45:37,789 --> 03:45:39,203
LIAM: But if it does happen,
it's your fault.

4684
03:45:39,203 --> 03:45:40,316
SAM: That's a season two thing.

4685
03:45:40,316 --> 03:45:42,272
ASHLEY: This time around.
When we fight K'Varn.

4686
03:45:42,272 --> 03:45:43,865
TALIESIN: That makes the t-shirt
extra special.

4687
03:45:43,865 --> 03:45:46,165
LAURA: Ooh, what are Lady Kima's
and Clarota's alignments?

4688
03:45:46,165 --> 03:45:47,142
Can we know that?

4689
03:45:47,142 --> 03:45:48,676
MATT: What's what?

4690
03:45:48,676 --> 03:45:49,587
LAURA: What are Lady Kima's
and Clarota's alignments?

4691
03:45:49,587 --> 03:45:51,275
MATT: You don't know that.

4692
03:45:51,275 --> 03:45:52,995
LAURA: We don't know that.

4693
03:45:52,995 --> 03:45:54,593
MATT: You have no clue
what their alignments are.

4694
03:45:54,593 --> 03:45:55,496
TALIESIN: I'm down for that.

4695
03:45:55,496 --> 03:45:56,595
MARISHA: Has anyone permanently died
at any point?

4696
03:45:56,595 --> 03:45:57,512
TALIESIN: Not in this game.
SAM: Permanently?

4697
03:45:57,512 --> 03:45:58,474
TRAVIS: In this campaign.

4698
03:45:58,474 --> 03:46:01,488
MATT: Nearly.
Ashley almost died permanently.

4699
03:46:01,488 --> 03:46:03,950
SAM: Some of us have been in comas
every other session.

4700
03:46:03,950 --> 03:46:07,819
ASHLEY: Hey, there is an emote Laura!

4701
03:46:07,819 --> 03:46:10,399
LIAM: Throw up the Laura emote,
if there is one.

4702
03:46:10,399 --> 03:46:12,260
SAM: How do I get an emote?

4703
03:46:12,260 --> 03:46:14,338
LIAM: Is there a spirit in the room?
Make it known if you're there.

4704
03:46:14,338 --> 03:46:17,708
SAM: What's the weirdest thing
Grog's ever done as a character?

4705
03:46:17,708 --> 03:46:23,520
Troll dick stuff... No, wait!
He went and humped a fairy in another--

4706
03:46:23,520 --> 03:46:25,223
TRAVIS: You don't know what happened
when I went through the portal!

4707
03:46:25,223 --> 03:46:25,933
SAM: Yeah, what happened up there?

4708
03:46:25,933 --> 03:46:27,777
ORION: Yeah, we don't know
what happened.

4709
03:46:27,777 --> 03:46:30,116
TRAVIS: A barbarian
never kisses and tells.

4710
03:46:30,116 --> 03:46:32,509
TALIESIN: What about all the other stuff
you probably did?

4711
03:46:32,509 --> 03:46:33,906
Will you tell us about that?

4712
03:46:33,906 --> 03:46:35,492
TRAVIS: We did summon a pony
and chop its head off.

4713
03:46:35,492 --> 03:46:38,206
SAM: That was fun.
TRAVIS: And smeared its gore all over us.

4714
03:46:38,206 --> 03:46:40,630
LAURA: You also collected
lots of dried poo

4715
03:46:40,630 --> 03:46:42,563
and put it in the Bag of Holding.

4716
03:46:42,563 --> 03:46:44,433
TRAVIS: We had a dried poo chunk.

4717
03:46:44,433 --> 03:46:46,303
SAM: We used dried poo
to blind the king a few episodes ago.

4718
03:46:46,303 --> 03:46:48,843
TALIESIN: You rage-looted.
The rage-looting was pretty much

4719
03:46:48,843 --> 03:46:50,339
the most disgraceful thing
I've ever seen.

4720
03:46:50,339 --> 03:46:52,129
LAURA: Yeah, the rage-looting.
TRAVIS: Disgraceful or amazing?

4721
03:46:52,129 --> 03:46:52,592
MARISHA: That got us in a lot of trouble.

4722
03:46:52,592 --> 03:46:55,155
ORION: We accidentally killed the ox,
right, because we stuffed it in the Bag?

4723
03:46:55,155 --> 03:46:57,750
TALIESIN: He felt guilty for weeks after.
He felt genuinely bad about it.

4724
03:46:57,750 --> 03:46:59,153
TRAVIS: Minutes after.

4725
03:46:59,153 --> 03:47:02,044
MARISHA: Oh, there was also
the time you slapped Trinket on the ass

4726
03:47:02,044 --> 03:47:04,531
and I think you were sleeping
on the couch that night.

4727
03:47:04,531 --> 03:47:05,508
TRAVIS: That was pretty bad.

4728
03:47:05,508 --> 03:47:06,158
TALIESIN: (laughs)

4729
03:47:06,158 --> 03:47:08,287
LAURA: (gasps) We were going
through this thing.

4730
03:47:08,287 --> 03:47:09,792
There were traps everywhere--
electrical traps, everywhere.

4731
03:47:09,792 --> 03:47:11,459
And all of us were being really cautious,

4732
03:47:11,459 --> 03:47:14,914
and Grog hits Trinket on the butt
with the blunt of his axe

4733
03:47:14,914 --> 03:47:17,459
and sends Trinket
running through the thing.

4734
03:47:17,459 --> 03:47:19,265
TRAVIS: He needed to be motivated!

4735
03:47:19,265 --> 03:47:22,638
LAURA: And he just hit every trap
on the way through and almost died.

4736
03:47:22,638 --> 03:47:23,364
ASHLEY: Oh, Trinket.

4737
03:47:23,364 --> 03:47:24,598
TRAVIS: He was a little clumsy,
but he got through, didn't he?

4738
03:47:24,598 --> 03:47:25,574
MATT: Yeah.

4739
03:47:25,574 --> 03:47:28,340
TRAVIS: Yeah? And then I slept
on the couch for two nights.

4740
03:47:28,340 --> 03:47:30,310
(all laugh)

4741
03:47:30,310 --> 03:47:32,079
TRAVIS: I was in big trouble.

4742
03:47:32,079 --> 03:47:33,672
TALIESIN: Erika Ishii, Yuri Lowenthal.

4743
03:47:33,672 --> 03:47:35,556
MATT: Yeah, Yuri's probably
going to come in at some point soon.

4744
03:47:35,556 --> 03:47:38,624
LAURA: He guested before we had the show.
He came in our game.

4745
03:47:38,624 --> 03:47:41,173
MATT: Yeah, he guested once
before the show.

4746
03:47:41,173 --> 03:47:41,854
SAM: He did?

4747
03:47:41,854 --> 03:47:43,339
MATT: As Ghost Fist, the dwarven monk.

4748
03:47:43,339 --> 03:47:45,250
LAURA: You weren't there.

4749
03:47:45,250 --> 03:47:45,811
That was probably a night
you were gone somewhere.

4750
03:47:45,811 --> 03:47:48,102
TRAVIS: Tiefling? What's a tiefling?

4751
03:47:48,102 --> 03:47:52,021
TALIESIN: Tieflings are like horned,
pseudo-demonic--

4752
03:47:52,021 --> 03:47:53,825
LIAM: We haven't encountered
any tieflings yet.

4753
03:47:53,825 --> 03:47:55,072
MARISHA: Demon blood.
TALIESIN: They're playables.

4754
03:47:55,072 --> 03:47:59,375
LAURA: That's what I want to be if I die.
I want to roll as a tiefling.

4755
03:47:59,375 --> 03:48:01,116
TALIESIN: That would be awesome.

4756
03:48:01,116 --> 03:48:04,969
MATT: You guys have seen them,
but they're very rare in this setting.

4757
03:48:04,969 --> 03:48:06,824
At least in this part of the world,
tieflings are super rare.

4758
03:48:06,824 --> 03:48:12,336
You haven't encountered them
much yet. Yet.

4759
03:48:12,336 --> 03:48:15,069
LIAM: Matt, someone's asking
what's good to roll as

4760
03:48:15,069 --> 03:48:17,548
if you are brand new to the game.

4761
03:48:17,548 --> 03:48:18,449
MATT: If you're brand new to the game?
LIAM: Fighter?

4762
03:48:18,449 --> 03:48:21,840
MATT: Fighter's pretty easy.

4763
03:48:21,840 --> 03:48:25,557
I personally would say
paladin or ranger are fun

4764
03:48:25,557 --> 03:48:27,069
because you can taste
a little bit of magic

4765
03:48:27,069 --> 03:48:28,968
but you're also combat-based.

4766
03:48:28,968 --> 03:48:32,270
It's a nice introduction
to how all things work,

4767
03:48:32,270 --> 03:48:34,460
and the magic is a slow build.
You don't get it immediately,

4768
03:48:34,460 --> 03:48:38,247
so at level one, you're just a melee guy--
or combat guy--

4769
03:48:38,247 --> 03:48:39,855
and eventually,
you start getting abilities.

4770
03:48:39,855 --> 03:48:43,426
I think the hybrid classes
are good for that.

4771
03:48:43,426 --> 03:48:47,251
TALIESIN: Someone asked about Percy.
Percy doesn't know if his sister died

4772
03:48:47,251 --> 03:48:49,761
and Percy doesn't have a plan
for his family

4773
03:48:49,761 --> 03:48:51,801
because right now
Percy is scared shitless

4774
03:48:51,801 --> 03:48:54,696
of everything going on in the north,
so no. No.

4775
03:48:54,696 --> 03:48:55,670
MATT: Someone else asked before,

4776
03:48:55,670 --> 03:48:57,562
how often do players interact
with their personal stories?

4777
03:48:57,562 --> 03:49:02,040
Occasionally.
There hasn't been much room for that

4778
03:49:02,040 --> 03:49:04,071
since everyone's been underground
for this entire run,

4779
03:49:04,071 --> 03:49:06,940
but there are personal stories
happening in the world

4780
03:49:06,940 --> 03:49:09,862
and I'm sure they will come up
as things progress, as well.

4781
03:49:09,862 --> 03:49:11,612
They have in the past,
and they're going to again.

4782
03:49:11,612 --> 03:49:14,271
LIAM: Someone asked, for fan art,

4783
03:49:14,271 --> 03:49:17,038
do we want the characters
to look like us?

4784
03:49:17,038 --> 03:49:20,471
I think how we really look.
I think either would be fine.

4785
03:49:20,471 --> 03:49:21,736
A lot of the stuff that's coming in

4786
03:49:21,736 --> 03:49:27,705
is based on the artwork of
a woman named Kit Buss.

4787
03:49:27,705 --> 03:49:32,018
She took input from us
on what we were looking for,

4788
03:49:32,018 --> 03:49:33,015
and she did the initial art

4789
03:49:33,015 --> 03:49:34,363
and people have riffed off that,
which is great.

4790
03:49:34,363 --> 03:49:34,953
MATT: They're incredible.

4791
03:49:34,953 --> 03:49:37,438
LIAM: If you want to make a dragonborn

4792
03:49:37,438 --> 03:49:38,938
that looks like Orion
with his face pulled out,

4793
03:49:38,938 --> 03:49:40,737
that's cool, too.

4794
03:49:40,737 --> 03:49:43,563
MARISHA: Yeah,
it's your interpretation.

4795
03:49:43,563 --> 03:49:46,024
SAM: If you want to put my face
on every character, that's cool.

4796
03:49:46,024 --> 03:49:47,804
MARISHA: We want to see
different interpretations.

4797
03:49:47,864 --> 03:49:49,007
MATT: That was a great photoshop.
LAURA: Somebody did do that.

4798
03:49:49,007 --> 03:49:50,121
TALIESIN: Someone did actually do that.
That was really weird.

4799
03:49:50,121 --> 03:49:53,453
MATT: I think Kit's artwork,

4800
03:49:53,453 --> 03:49:57,461
we're using as the basis
of the official art,

4801
03:49:57,461 --> 03:50:00,483
but you're welcome to create
whatever you want going forward.

4802
03:50:00,483 --> 03:50:02,447
LAURA: Kit's really talented.

4803
03:50:02,447 --> 03:50:04,290
LIAM: Could someone draw Scanlan

4804
03:50:04,290 --> 03:50:07,887
with the illusionary growth
and the illusionary wang?

4805
03:50:07,887 --> 03:50:09,450
LAURA: The illusionary
giant weird nipple?

4806
03:50:09,450 --> 03:50:10,469
SAM: Third purple nipple?
LIAM: Yes.

4807
03:50:10,469 --> 03:50:11,973
SAM: And the donkey dong?

4808
03:50:11,973 --> 03:50:14,078
LIAM: I mean, the donkey dong
could be in pants or something.

4809
03:50:14,078 --> 03:50:15,055
It doesn't have to be pornographic.

4810
03:50:15,055 --> 03:50:17,228
LAURA: This makes me uncomfortable.
MATT: Yeah.

4811
03:50:17,228 --> 03:50:21,145
TALIESIN: There's just so much to read.

4812
03:50:21,145 --> 03:50:22,945
MATT: Do you write a synopsis
for previous ventures?

4813
03:50:22,945 --> 03:50:25,352
Actually, the synopsis for each episode

4814
03:50:25,352 --> 03:50:27,034
is on the Geek &amp; Sundry website
underneath the episodes,

4815
03:50:27,034 --> 03:50:29,549
so it'll tell you what happens
in that episode underneath.

4816
03:50:29,549 --> 03:50:32,761
Just go to geekandsundry.com.
He writes them all.

4817
03:50:32,761 --> 03:50:34,181
LIAM: Go to Geek &amp; Sundry,
then click on shows,

4818
03:50:34,181 --> 03:50:38,004
then click on Critical Role,
and that'll get you there.

4819
03:50:38,004 --> 03:50:43,091
LAURA: It's
geekandsundry.com/shows/critical-role.

4820
03:50:43,091 --> 03:50:45,343
LIAM: It's as easy as that.
MATT: Yeah. So simple.

4821
03:50:45,343 --> 03:50:46,846
TRAVIS: I think
this might have been covered,

4822
03:50:46,846 --> 03:50:48,376
but how did the campaign start?

4823
03:50:48,376 --> 03:50:49,625
MATT: His birthday.

4824
03:50:49,625 --> 03:50:52,679
LIAM: Yeah, for my birthday
I said I wanted to play D&amp;D for a night

4825
03:50:52,679 --> 03:50:55,958
and I asked the people that I wanted,
and they came,

4826
03:50:55,958 --> 03:50:59,887
and then the next day
I sent out an email going,

4827
03:50:59,887 --> 03:51:02,554
"oh man, that was so great.
I feel like we should do that again."

4828
03:51:02,554 --> 03:51:06,215
And nobody responded for a day,
and I felt ashamed and sad

4829
03:51:06,215 --> 03:51:08,899
because I thought that I was a dork
and nobody wanted to do it,

4830
03:51:08,899 --> 03:51:10,512
but then slowly,
everyone trickled in going,

4831
03:51:10,512 --> 03:51:11,989
"yeah, yeah, yeah."
And here we are.

4832
03:51:11,989 --> 03:51:13,725
MARISHA: Oh, really?
I didn't know you felt--

4833
03:51:13,725 --> 03:51:15,834
LIAM: Yep. For a day, I was like,

4834
03:51:15,834 --> 03:51:18,685
"oh, god. I just outed myself
as the biggest dork in the group."

4835
03:51:18,685 --> 03:51:19,771
MARISHA, LAURA, AND MATT: Aw.

4836
03:51:19,771 --> 03:51:22,448
TRAVIS: Is Trinket's intelligence
higher than Grog's?

4837
03:51:22,448 --> 03:51:23,471
LIAM: Yes.
LAURA: No.

4838
03:51:23,471 --> 03:51:25,193
MATT: No.
TRAVIS: No. Okay? It's not.

4839
03:51:25,193 --> 03:51:29,193
LAURA: I think his intelligence is a four,
so he's two points lower than you.

4840
03:51:29,193 --> 03:51:30,221
TRAVIS: Yeah, suck it.
LIAM: That's very close.

4841
03:51:30,221 --> 03:51:31,343
ASHLEY: Best and worst D&amp;D memories.

4842
03:51:31,343 --> 03:51:33,083
I can only read that
because it's in all caps.

4843
03:51:33,083 --> 03:51:35,203
TRAVIS: Best and worst?
MATT: Best and worst D&amp;D memories.

4844
03:51:37,023 --> 03:51:39,757
SAM: Our six-hour games were pretty bad.

4845
03:51:39,757 --> 03:51:41,663
TRAVIS: (laughs)
SAM: No, I love this.

4846
03:51:41,663 --> 03:51:43,486
LAURA: Dude, they were like eight hours.

4847
03:51:43,486 --> 03:51:44,876
MARISHA: How much do you write
and how much do you improv?

4848
03:51:44,876 --> 03:51:47,651
I mean, someone said,

4849
03:51:47,651 --> 03:51:49,546
how much do we write
and how much do we improv?

4850
03:51:49,546 --> 03:51:52,271
Everything the players do is improv.

4851
03:51:52,271 --> 03:51:53,337
MATT: Yeah, there's no pre-planning.

4852
03:51:53,337 --> 03:51:55,595
LIAM: Matt's writing plot points,
but he's improvising, too,

4853
03:51:55,595 --> 03:51:58,642
and we have no idea
what the hell's going to happen.

4854
03:51:58,642 --> 03:52:00,407
SAM: I write all my songs from scratch.

4855
03:52:00,407 --> 03:52:02,187
(all laugh)

4856
03:52:02,187 --> 03:52:05,517
ORION: Every day he comes in.
Two hours, just writing songs.

4857
03:52:05,517 --> 03:52:07,918
TRAVIS: Does your full name
fit into a tweet?

4858
03:52:07,938 --> 03:52:09,702
TALIESIN: I have been specifically
not tweeting my full name yet.

4859
03:52:09,702 --> 03:52:11,414
LAURA: Why?
TRAVIS: Don't let them have it.

4860
03:52:11,414 --> 03:52:12,238
TALIESIN: I've been really enjoying

4861
03:52:12,238 --> 03:52:15,043
watching people attempt
to figure out what it is.

4862
03:52:15,043 --> 03:52:24,051
Right now, Percy's in a hole underground,
so it's not his favorite place to be.

4863
03:52:24,051 --> 03:52:25,162
TRAVIS: (laughs)

4864
03:52:25,162 --> 03:52:27,515
TALIESIN: Once I'm actually in a place
to try and impress people,

4865
03:52:27,515 --> 03:52:29,556
I'll be saying my name more.

4866
03:52:29,556 --> 03:52:32,426
TRAVIS: Did you ever consider
doing a longer episode?

4867
03:52:32,426 --> 03:52:35,157
LIAM: I don't know.
Do you guys want to watch for five hours?

4868
03:52:35,157 --> 03:52:37,352
LAURA: I know, that seems a bit much
for you guys.

4869
03:52:37,362 --> 03:52:38,562
MARISHA: We used to play for eight hours.

4870
03:52:38,562 --> 03:52:41,565
LAURA: We used to play for eight hours!

4871
03:52:41,565 --> 03:52:46,521
MATT: Someone asked why do I treat ones
as regular failures instead of flops?

4872
03:52:46,521 --> 03:52:50,203
Because I run my campaigns pretty hard,

4873
03:52:50,203 --> 03:52:55,099
and I think if 1s
were critical fails the classic way,

4874
03:52:55,099 --> 03:52:59,071
we would have TPK'd by now.

4875
03:52:59,071 --> 03:53:02,718
TRAVIS: What's that?
MATT, SAM, AND ORION: Total party kill.

4876
03:53:02,718 --> 03:53:06,870
MATT: Because in some rule sets,
when you roll a one, it's a serious--

4877
03:53:06,870 --> 03:53:10,503
I like treating it
as no matter what you're doing,

4878
03:53:10,503 --> 03:53:12,633
you fail, regardless.
No matter what your bonus is, you fail.

4879
03:53:12,633 --> 03:53:14,019
I think that's enough.

4880
03:53:14,019 --> 03:53:16,539
In old campaigns I used to run,
if you rolled a one attacking somebody,

4881
03:53:16,539 --> 03:53:17,865
your weapon would go flying
across the room

4882
03:53:17,865 --> 03:53:19,522
and you'd fall on the ground.

4883
03:53:19,522 --> 03:53:21,185
Or if you were trying to lift a boulder,

4884
03:53:21,185 --> 03:53:24,549
the boulder would fall and crush you
and you're dead.

4885
03:53:24,549 --> 03:53:26,274
TALIESIN: Yeah,
I like the way you treat it.

4886
03:53:26,274 --> 03:53:28,158
MATT: Which can be fun for certain games,
but for this--

4887
03:53:28,158 --> 03:53:30,152
TRAVIS: Why do you want us to die?
What a shitty question.

4888
03:53:30,152 --> 03:53:31,188
MATT: For this, there's enough challenge

4889
03:53:31,188 --> 03:53:33,302
where I think we don't need
any more reasons.

4890
03:53:33,302 --> 03:53:35,643
If it's funny and it makes sense--

4891
03:53:35,643 --> 03:53:39,546
if it's a difficult challenge
and you roll a one,

4892
03:53:39,546 --> 03:53:43,098
there might be some drawbacks
to a failure in that case,

4893
03:53:43,098 --> 03:53:46,065
but I don't think
it's a consistent thing I need to do.

4894
03:53:46,065 --> 03:53:47,547
MARISHA: People are saying
to make them longer.

4895
03:53:47,547 --> 03:53:52,711
LIAM: Sam, I saw a question
wondering when you're going to make

4896
03:53:52,711 --> 03:53:55,495
a Weird Al Yankovic-esque
compilation of songs.

4897
03:53:55,495 --> 03:53:59,369
SAM: (laughs)
LIAM: Next month?

4898
03:53:59,369 --> 03:54:00,730
SAM: Yeah, pretty soon.
I'm working on an album.

4899
03:54:00,730 --> 03:54:03,450
ORION: We're going to be
in the studio.

4900
03:54:03,450 --> 03:54:04,603
SAM: Yeah, we'll be in the studio.

4901
03:54:04,603 --> 03:54:06,649
TALIESIN: Scanlan at Sunset,
coming soon.

4902
03:54:06,649 --> 03:54:08,854
SAM: It's just me
changing the words to contemporary songs,

4903
03:54:08,854 --> 03:54:14,775
but making them about Dungeons &amp; Dragons,
and I'll grow my hair like Weird Al.

4904
03:54:14,775 --> 03:54:18,083
LAURA: There was one time, for a 1,
that it was a really funny bad fail,

4905
03:54:18,083 --> 03:54:21,028
and that was when
we were fighting the Dread Emperor.

4906
03:54:21,028 --> 03:54:21,898
ASHLEY: Oh, and you went through--

4907
03:54:21,898 --> 03:54:23,112
TALIESIN: Through
the stained-glass window.

4908
03:54:23,112 --> 03:54:24,320
LAURA: And Scanlan was trying
to get the final blow,

4909
03:54:24,320 --> 03:54:25,410
and he rolled a one.

4910
03:54:25,410 --> 03:54:26,710
ASHLEY: That's one of my favorite moments.

4911
03:54:26,710 --> 03:54:28,009
LAURA: And the Dread Emperor
literally side-stepped him

4912
03:54:28,009 --> 03:54:30,137
and Scanlan fell out of a window.

4913
03:54:30,137 --> 03:54:31,865
TRAVIS: He lunged and-- tell them.

4914
03:54:31,865 --> 03:54:35,850
MATT: Yeah, so the Dread Emperor
had maybe three or four hit points left.

4915
03:54:35,850 --> 03:54:38,325
People were hurt on the ground.
It was this epic confrontation.

4916
03:54:38,325 --> 03:54:39,333
LAURA: We were dying.

4917
03:54:39,333 --> 03:54:41,070
TRAVIS: Scanlan's never killed anything.

4918
03:54:41,070 --> 03:54:42,680
MATT: Yeah, he's never killed anything.

4919
03:54:42,680 --> 03:54:44,173
He pulls out his blade
and just goes for an attack

4920
03:54:44,173 --> 03:54:45,417
and we're all like, "Yes, go!"

4921
03:54:45,417 --> 03:54:46,594
LAURA: "Go, Scanlan!"

4922
03:54:46,594 --> 03:54:48,248
MATT: And he rolls a one,

4923
03:54:48,248 --> 03:54:50,218
and it's him charging towards him,
blade in the air.

4924
03:54:50,218 --> 03:54:51,278
SAM: (quiet war cry)

4925
03:54:51,278 --> 03:54:53,526
MATT: "You son of a bitch!" Running.

4926
03:54:53,526 --> 03:54:57,824
Dread Emperor just side-steps.
Scanlan goes flying--

4927
03:54:57,824 --> 03:54:59,102
LIAM: Nothing but net.

4928
03:54:59,102 --> 03:55:00,125
MATT: Loses his balance,

4929
03:55:00,125 --> 03:55:02,205
crashes through a three-story-high
stained-glass window

4930
03:55:02,205 --> 03:55:05,981
in the back end of this library,
out into a bramble bush,

4931
03:55:05,981 --> 03:55:09,129
with all the glass tumbling onto him
and is like, "Ow."

4932
03:55:09,129 --> 03:55:10,063
TRAVIS: (laughs)
MATT: On the ground.

4933
03:55:10,063 --> 03:55:13,077
ASHLEY: It was one
of the funniest moments that we had.

4934
03:55:13,077 --> 03:55:14,089
LAURA: It was really amazing.
MATT: It was pretty great.

4935
03:55:14,089 --> 03:55:15,590
TALIESIN: It was amazing.

4936
03:55:15,590 --> 03:55:16,030
ASHLEY: I was crying,
I was laughing so hard.

4937
03:55:16,030 --> 03:55:18,205
ORION: No Holds Bard.
That's the name of your album.

4938
03:55:18,205 --> 03:55:19,847
ALL: Oh!

4939
03:55:19,847 --> 03:55:22,771
SAM: No Holds Bard. That's good.
MATT: No Holds Bard. I like that.

4940
03:55:22,771 --> 03:55:27,219
LIAM: Ashley. Scanlan or Steve Rogers?
ASHLEY: Oh, man.

4941
03:55:29,609 --> 03:55:31,428
SAM: Or Mr. Rogers?

4942
03:55:31,428 --> 03:55:36,348
ASHLEY: That's a really hard choice.
Mr. Rogers, for sure. I love Mr. Rogers.

4943
03:55:36,348 --> 03:55:37,678
TRAVIS: When are you guys
going to do a drunk episode?

4944
03:55:37,678 --> 03:55:39,180
TALIESIN: Have we not
done a drunk episode?

4945
03:55:39,180 --> 03:55:40,104
MARISHA: A drunk episode?

4946
03:55:40,104 --> 03:55:41,540
MATT: Someone asked, do I fudge my rolls?

4947
03:55:41,540 --> 03:55:44,744
No, because at that point
it becomes too weird.

4948
03:55:44,744 --> 03:55:47,110
If you don't stick
to at least what roll is there,

4949
03:55:47,110 --> 03:55:49,249
then you lose the essence of fate,

4950
03:55:49,249 --> 03:55:51,061
and I think
that's what makes it fun for me.

4951
03:55:51,061 --> 03:55:54,081
It makes it scary because
then I don't know what's going to happen.

4952
03:55:54,081 --> 03:55:57,583
LIAM: Scanlan has fudged a bedroll.
SAM: I rolled the fudge.

4953
03:55:57,583 --> 03:56:00,934
MARISHA: Question.
Worst possible enemy to fight?

4954
03:56:00,934 --> 03:56:01,990
Probably a beholder.

4955
03:56:01,990 --> 03:56:02,907
LAURA: A beholder.

4956
03:56:02,907 --> 03:56:03,740
TALIESIN: A beholder, I would imagine,
is the worst.

4957
03:56:03,740 --> 03:56:04,435
MATT: (laughs)

4958
03:56:04,435 --> 03:56:05,316
SAM: We'll find out.
Maybe he'll be super easy.

4959
03:56:05,316 --> 03:56:07,563
ORION: I don't know if you guys noticed,

4960
03:56:07,563 --> 03:56:10,862
who's been watching this whole time
we've been playing,

4961
03:56:10,862 --> 03:56:14,369
I generally do random chaotic things

4962
03:56:14,369 --> 03:56:16,407
to be quirky and funny
just because I like to,

4963
03:56:16,407 --> 03:56:21,254
but this is the first time I was scared.

4964
03:56:21,254 --> 03:56:23,338
I really freaked out

4965
03:56:23,338 --> 03:56:25,942
with the confirmation
it's a fucking beholder.

4966
03:56:25,942 --> 03:56:27,342
It's terrible.

4967
03:56:27,342 --> 03:56:28,393
TRAVIS: You looked excited.

4968
03:56:28,393 --> 03:56:30,486
LAURA: Yeah, you did look excited.
I think you were excited

4969
03:56:30,486 --> 03:56:32,135
that you thought it might be a beholder,
and then it was.

4970
03:56:32,135 --> 03:56:33,504
ORION: Yeah, and then I was terrified.

4971
03:56:33,504 --> 03:56:34,997
MATT: It's going to be fun.

4972
03:56:34,997 --> 03:56:37,153
ORION: It was a deluge of terror
after that.

4973
03:56:37,153 --> 03:56:38,918
MARISHA: Someone asked
how the party met in-game.

4974
03:56:38,918 --> 03:56:40,753
That's a good question.

4975
03:56:40,753 --> 03:56:42,033
LAURA: Oh, that's a good question.

4976
03:56:42,033 --> 03:56:43,498
TALIESIN: You guys found me
in a basement.

4977
03:56:43,498 --> 03:56:46,859
LAURA: Yeah! We saved you.
TALIESIN: Yeah, I had been arrested.

4978
03:56:46,859 --> 03:56:49,255
MATT: The very first game we played,

4979
03:56:49,255 --> 03:56:52,067
you all had come together
as individual mercenaries

4980
03:56:52,067 --> 03:56:56,309
in the city of Stillben,
which is a swamp town

4981
03:56:56,309 --> 03:57:00,053
on the far eastern side
of this continent.

4982
03:57:00,053 --> 03:57:01,193
You all, for your own reasons,
had come there

4983
03:57:01,193 --> 03:57:02,779
because you needed money,

4984
03:57:02,779 --> 03:57:06,968
you were trying to establish
some way of making your skills useful,

4985
03:57:06,968 --> 03:57:09,629
and there was a job board,
and all of you came together in a tavern,

4986
03:57:09,629 --> 03:57:11,211
saw there was a posting,

4987
03:57:11,211 --> 03:57:14,824
and you decided to combine forces
and try it out.

4988
03:57:14,824 --> 03:57:16,904
That's how that started.

4989
03:57:16,904 --> 03:57:20,442
And then they met Percy along the way.
In a prison in the Umbra Hills.

4990
03:57:20,442 --> 03:57:23,008
TALIESIN: We've never really discussed
what I was doing down there.

4991
03:57:23,008 --> 03:57:24,886
LAURA: Yeah, I would like to know.

4992
03:57:24,886 --> 03:57:25,890
TALIESIN: That's a story for another time.

4993
03:57:25,890 --> 03:57:28,378
TRAVIS: So why did Scanlan
take a dump on that guest room bed?

4994
03:57:28,378 --> 03:57:30,826
MATT: Yeah, Scanlan.
ORION: He's kooky.

4995
03:57:30,826 --> 03:57:32,839
SAM: You'll find out
when that guy gets to his room.

4996
03:57:32,839 --> 03:57:34,549
(all laugh)

4997
03:57:34,549 --> 03:57:37,673
SAM: And just... has the worst day.

4998
03:57:37,673 --> 03:57:41,371
LAURA: (laughs)
TRAVIS: (laughing) Has the worst day.

4999
03:57:41,371 --> 03:57:44,999
LIAM: We probably talked about this
in the last Q&amp;A,

5000
03:57:44,999 --> 03:57:46,406
but I'm sure there's
a lot of new people here.

5001
03:57:46,406 --> 03:57:48,697
They want to know about Pike's death.

5002
03:57:48,697 --> 03:57:50,520
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: (fake cries)

5003
03:57:50,520 --> 03:57:53,148
MARISHA: It was so sad.
LAURA: It was so sad.

5004
03:57:53,148 --> 03:57:56,322
LIAM: Keyleth looked at her
and thought she was a kid, and then--

5005
03:57:56,322 --> 03:57:57,896
MATT AND MARISHA: (laugh)

5006
03:57:57,896 --> 03:58:00,212
MARISHA: And I was just like,
"I hate kids!" (pshh)

5007
03:58:00,212 --> 03:58:02,553
MATT: I'll try to make it quick.

5008
03:58:02,553 --> 03:58:05,867
In what was the final boss battle
for the first arc,

5009
03:58:05,867 --> 03:58:09,533
they were going towards
the center of the city

5010
03:58:09,533 --> 03:58:11,788
because a glabrezu,
a treachery demon,

5011
03:58:11,788 --> 03:58:17,327
had infiltrated the Sovereign Uriel,
the king of the area, and his family.

5012
03:58:17,327 --> 03:58:20,183
Filled their bodies with shades
as opposed to their souls.

5013
03:58:20,183 --> 03:58:22,396
They managed to recover the family,

5014
03:58:22,396 --> 03:58:24,982
but they got into a conflict
with the glabrezu,

5015
03:58:24,982 --> 03:58:29,449
and as the fight was ensuing,
Pike got too close,

5016
03:58:29,449 --> 03:58:33,096
the glabrezu took a swipe at her,
and rolled a critical hit,

5017
03:58:33,096 --> 03:58:36,332
and did enough damage
to bring her to death instantly.

5018
03:58:36,332 --> 03:58:40,022
So mid-fight, went down.
The whole party froze.

5019
03:58:40,022 --> 03:58:43,541
ASHLEY: I had already taken some hits,
and then I realized at a certain point,

5020
03:58:43,541 --> 03:58:46,367
because in the Pathfinder edition,
if you're negative--

5021
03:58:46,367 --> 03:58:47,693
MATT: Your constitution score.

5022
03:58:47,693 --> 03:58:51,652
ASHLEY: Your constitution,
and then I wasn't keeping track,

5023
03:58:51,652 --> 03:58:55,009
and I looked down
and it was way past my constitution,

5024
03:58:55,009 --> 03:58:59,699
and I was like, "Oh, Matt?
So what does it mean if you're this?"

5025
03:58:59,699 --> 03:59:03,772
The look that he gave me,
he was like, "Oh."

5026
03:59:03,772 --> 03:59:10,554
And he just paused because he was like,
"Oh, that. You're dead."

5027
03:59:10,554 --> 03:59:11,746
(all laugh)

5028
03:59:11,746 --> 03:59:12,956
ASHLEY: He was trying
to figure out a way to say it.

5029
03:59:12,956 --> 03:59:13,817
MATT: It was awful.

5030
03:59:13,817 --> 03:59:16,624
ASHLEY: And I instantly started crying.
I was like, "No! No no no!"

5031
03:59:16,624 --> 03:59:18,747
TRAVIS: There's a video of it.

5032
03:59:18,747 --> 03:59:21,961
LAURA: All of us are crying.
ASHLEY: It was horrible!

5033
03:59:21,961 --> 03:59:23,600
TRAVIS: You went under the table.

5034
03:59:23,600 --> 03:59:26,067
MARISHA: It's on Liam's Vine.
If you go find Liam's Vine,

5035
03:59:26,067 --> 03:59:30,836
there's a five-second clip
of all of us just screaming bloody murder.

5036
03:59:30,836 --> 03:59:31,897
MATT: It wasn't just like
she fell and died.

5037
03:59:31,897 --> 03:59:33,800
The glabrezu has giant pincers.

5038
03:59:33,800 --> 03:59:39,064
Grabbed her by the torso, lifted her up,
and then snapped her in half, essentially.

5039
03:59:39,064 --> 03:59:40,159
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: It was terrible.

5040
03:59:40,159 --> 03:59:41,728
MATT: And they had to recover
both halves of her.

5041
03:59:41,728 --> 03:59:43,228
TALIESIN: How long ago was that?

5042
03:59:43,228 --> 03:59:46,018
MATT: That was over a year ago.
ORION: It was a year, yeah.

5043
03:59:46,018 --> 03:59:48,225
MARISHA: I remember you saying
you'd had a bad week, too.

5044
03:59:48,225 --> 03:59:49,454
MATT: No, it wasn't a year.
Almost a year.

5045
03:59:49,454 --> 03:59:50,694
ASHLEY: I did.

5046
03:59:50,694 --> 03:59:52,224
LAURA: You were on your way out the door,

5047
03:59:52,224 --> 03:59:55,008
and then we talked you into staying
for a little longer

5048
03:59:55,008 --> 03:59:56,649
because we were getting into the fight
and you were like, "Okay, I'll stay."

5049
03:59:56,649 --> 03:59:58,733
ASHLEY: I was like, "I'll stay."
LAURA: And then she died.

5050
03:59:58,733 --> 03:59:59,645
MARISHA: That's right,
you were going to go somewhere.

5051
03:59:59,645 --> 04:00:01,938
ASHLEY: "In case anybody gets hurt."

5052
04:00:01,938 --> 04:00:03,158
MARISHA: Oh, that's right,
because didn't you have guests?

5053
04:00:03,158 --> 04:00:04,244
You had people who were visiting you

5054
04:00:04,244 --> 04:00:05,757
and you went back
and you're like,

5055
04:00:05,757 --> 04:00:10,037
"(cries) You don't understand."

5056
04:00:10,037 --> 04:00:12,694
MATT: I definitely have ideas
to keep the campaign going past level 20

5057
04:00:12,694 --> 04:00:13,878
and to epic or mythic stages.

5058
04:00:13,878 --> 04:00:17,303
I would like to, if it goes that long.
We shall see.

5059
04:00:17,303 --> 04:00:18,529
SAM: What happens at level 20?

5060
04:00:18,529 --> 04:00:19,786
MARISHA: We start killing gods.

5061
04:00:19,786 --> 04:00:24,770
ORION: There was a question for everybody.
You cannot pick yourself.

5062
04:00:24,770 --> 04:00:27,171
Which is your favorite character?

5063
04:00:27,171 --> 04:00:28,783
LAURA: Oh, what's our--
ooh, that's a tough one.

5064
04:00:28,783 --> 04:00:31,426
LIAM: Outside of ourselves.

5065
04:00:31,426 --> 04:00:34,910
ASHLEY: I would pick Grog or Scanlan,
but also rogues.

5066
04:00:34,910 --> 04:00:37,890
The damage that you can do is so crazy.

5067
04:00:37,890 --> 04:00:40,089
TRAVIS: I pick Mercer.
Nobody else can take it.

5068
04:00:40,089 --> 04:00:43,488
MATT: I'm not a character.
TRAVIS: You're many characters.

5069
04:00:43,488 --> 04:00:45,375
MATT: Well, that's cheating.
TRAVIS: Is it?

5070
04:00:45,375 --> 04:00:47,651
LIAM: Oh, it's so hard.
LAURA: That's so hard. I love everyone.

5071
04:00:47,651 --> 04:00:50,596
TALIESIN: I think Laura's
actually my favorite character.

5072
04:00:50,596 --> 04:00:51,224
LAURA: Really?

5073
04:00:51,224 --> 04:00:55,342
TALIESIN: You have these very interesting
emotional reactions to things

5074
04:00:55,342 --> 04:00:58,803
that I find really entertaining
from my side of the table.

5075
04:00:58,803 --> 04:01:03,979
LIAM: Scanlan is really hard to beat
for laughs,

5076
04:01:03,979 --> 04:01:08,275
but Tiberius is so quirky.
I love that.

5077
04:01:08,275 --> 04:01:14,522
I love how klutzy Keyleth is,
with raw power at the same time.

5078
04:01:14,522 --> 04:01:16,049
I'm very partial to my twin.

5079
04:01:16,049 --> 04:01:17,648
LAURA: Oh.
TALIESIN: Aw.

5080
04:01:17,648 --> 04:01:19,402
LIAM: Trinket is pretty great.
LAURA: Trinket is the bomb.

5081
04:01:19,402 --> 04:01:20,683
LIAM: It's hard to pick.

5082
04:01:20,683 --> 04:01:24,545
MARISHA: It's hard to pick.
I don't know. I have a soft spot for Grog.

5083
04:01:24,545 --> 04:01:26,834
TRAVIS: Oh, Keyleth.

5084
04:01:26,834 --> 04:01:32,481
ORION: I agree. I would like to do
the complete opposite of Tiberius

5085
04:01:32,481 --> 04:01:36,901
with rage, and just tear shit apart
with my teeth.

5086
04:01:36,901 --> 04:01:38,721
MARISHA: I like Percy, too.
I'm not going to lie.

5087
04:01:38,721 --> 04:01:38,976
TALIESIN: Aw.

5088
04:01:38,976 --> 04:01:39,467
LAURA: Yeah, everybody's great.

5089
04:01:39,467 --> 04:01:41,428
MARISHA: Percy as a character.

5090
04:01:41,428 --> 04:01:44,994
LAURA: I don't have as much fun playing
if Sam's not there

5091
04:01:44,994 --> 04:01:48,608
because Scanlan is such a funny,
fun character, and your ideas for things.

5092
04:01:48,608 --> 04:01:51,360
Even right from where
we first started playing,

5093
04:01:51,360 --> 04:01:54,335
the things that you came up with to--

5094
04:01:54,335 --> 04:01:56,038
TALIESIN: Burt Reynolds.
LAURA: Yeah! Burt Reynolds.

5095
04:01:56,038 --> 04:01:57,778
TRAVIS: Fucking Burt Reynolds.
SAM: He's coming back soon.

5096
04:01:57,778 --> 04:01:59,939
LAURA: All these different things
that you would do,

5097
04:01:59,939 --> 04:02:00,936
it's just so different.

5098
04:02:00,936 --> 04:02:01,992
TRAVIS: Burt Reynolds,
the customs officer.

5099
04:02:01,992 --> 04:02:02,791
TALIESIN: With the badge.

5100
04:02:02,791 --> 04:02:03,518
MATT: That's one
of my favorite deterrents.

5101
04:02:03,518 --> 04:02:06,413
You avoided essentially
what would have been a throwdown

5102
04:02:06,413 --> 04:02:08,755
with the entire thieves' guild of Emon
by bluffing your way--

5103
04:02:08,755 --> 04:02:09,947
MARISHA: Finger mustache.

5104
04:02:09,947 --> 04:02:12,448
MATT: By pulling out a silver star--
LAURA: And a fake mustache.

5105
04:02:12,448 --> 04:02:15,998
MATT: And convincing them

5106
04:02:15,998 --> 04:02:18,554
that you were part
of the customs department.

5107
04:02:18,554 --> 04:02:25,311
ORION: Pike would be super fun
to play, too, because clerics are crazy.

5108
04:02:25,311 --> 04:02:26,153
MARISHA: Yeah, Pike's great.

5109
04:02:26,153 --> 04:02:27,173
TALIESIN: You're really
the heart of the group.

5110
04:02:27,173 --> 04:02:27,844
We don't pretend that losing you

5111
04:02:27,844 --> 04:02:30,587
wouldn't have broken us
into tiny little pieces.

5112
04:02:30,587 --> 04:02:32,462
MATT: Gilmore.
SAM: Gilmore!

5113
04:02:32,462 --> 04:02:33,410
MATT: You guys haven't met Gilmore yet.

5114
04:02:33,410 --> 04:02:35,500
LAURA: Oh my god,
you guys are going to love him.

5115
04:02:35,500 --> 04:02:36,720
SAM: I can't wait.
TALIESIN: You haven't met Gilmore!

5116
04:02:36,720 --> 04:02:37,775
MARISHA: They haven't met Gilmore.

5117
04:02:37,775 --> 04:02:38,950
SAM: What is it, 
Gilmore's Glorious Goods?

5118
04:02:38,950 --> 04:02:39,987
MARISHA AND LAURA:
Gilmore's Glorious Goods.

5119
04:02:39,987 --> 04:02:40,646
TRAVIS: We haven't been to Gilmore's?

5120
04:02:40,646 --> 04:02:42,452
LAURA: No, not since the show started.

5121
04:02:42,452 --> 04:02:44,490
MATT: They haven't seen Emon yet.

5122
04:02:44,490 --> 04:02:46,855
ASHLEY: Another really special thing
that we've done

5123
04:02:46,855 --> 04:02:48,169
is that during Christmas time--

5124
04:02:48,169 --> 04:02:51,284
SAM: Oh, yeah! 
There's a Christmas episode.

5125
04:02:51,284 --> 04:02:56,491
ASHLEY: We always have specials,
or winter's fest.

5126
04:02:56,491 --> 04:02:58,147
TALIESIN: We get to do
a Christmas special online this year!

5127
04:02:58,147 --> 04:03:01,367
ASHLEY: And we always give each other
presents from our characters.

5128
04:03:01,367 --> 04:03:05,357
And it's probably my favorite thing, ever.

5129
04:03:05,357 --> 04:03:07,858
TALIESIN: It is so amazing.
ASHLEY: It's so amazing.

5130
04:03:07,858 --> 04:03:09,549
MARISHA: We come in Christmas pajamas.

5131
04:03:09,549 --> 04:03:14,702
ASHLEY: The first Christmas,
Grog gave me two pine cone earrings.

5132
04:03:14,702 --> 04:03:17,524
LAURA: Literally pine cones. 
It was street.

5133
04:03:17,524 --> 04:03:18,617
TRAVIS: They were pine cones.

5134
04:03:18,617 --> 04:03:19,560
MARISHA: I still have the pine cones
you gave me.

5135
04:03:19,560 --> 04:03:21,810
TALIESIN: I still have
the bag of leftover IKEA crap.

5136
04:03:21,810 --> 04:03:23,743
MATT: That's a good question,
which Laura should answer.

5137
04:03:23,743 --> 04:03:26,218
What kind of dice do you all use,
and what do you do with bad dice?

5138
04:03:26,218 --> 04:03:29,334
ORION: (laughs)
MARISHA: Oh, I love your dice thing.

5139
04:03:29,334 --> 04:03:31,310
ASHLEY: I currently want to burn my dice.
LAURA: Yeah, you should.

5140
04:03:31,310 --> 04:03:32,627
ASHLEY: Because I've been rolling like a--

5141
04:03:32,627 --> 04:03:33,668
TRAVIS: You had a good initiative.

5142
04:03:33,668 --> 04:03:35,928
LAURA: I've told you the last five games
to get rid of your dice.

5143
04:03:35,928 --> 04:03:36,999
ASHLEY: I know you have.

5144
04:03:36,999 --> 04:03:38,226
LAURA: Because that's what I do.
If I roll with a--

5145
04:03:38,226 --> 04:03:40,736
TRAVIS: Yeah, you are fickle
on your dice, though. Come on.

5146
04:03:40,736 --> 04:03:43,349
LAURA: I am fickle. If I roll a one,
it's gone for the game.

5147
04:03:43,349 --> 04:03:44,680
I won't roll it again.

5148
04:03:44,680 --> 04:03:47,664
But if it rolls bad
more than three times,

5149
04:03:47,664 --> 04:03:49,577
it's out. It's gone.

5150
04:03:49,577 --> 04:03:49,952
ORION: It's done.

5151
04:03:49,952 --> 04:03:50,763
MARISHA: You have a dice graveyard.

5152
04:03:50,763 --> 04:03:53,103
LAURA: There is a dice graveyard,
and I spent a lot of money

5153
04:03:53,103 --> 04:03:56,244
on these really beautiful 
amethyst dice.

5154
04:03:56,244 --> 04:03:59,167
ORION: And they're garbage now.

5155
04:03:59,167 --> 04:04:01,001
MARISHA: You should auction them.

5156
04:04:01,001 --> 04:04:01,864
You should auction 
all your graveyard dice.

5157
04:04:01,864 --> 04:04:04,733
LAURA: I should!
ORION: No! They're cursed.

5158
04:04:04,733 --> 04:04:06,319
LAURA: That's true. 
But they're beautiful.

5159
04:04:06,319 --> 04:04:08,372
TALIESIN: They're worth more money
because they're cursed.

5160
04:04:08,372 --> 04:04:10,745
ORION: Oh, you could buy cursed die,
which is now a mystical item.

5161
04:04:10,745 --> 04:04:14,095
LIAM: Guys, there is no god,

5162
04:04:14,095 --> 04:04:16,680
and it is the cold, random chance
of the universe.

5163
04:04:16,680 --> 04:04:18,822
ORION AND MATT: (crack up)

5164
04:04:18,822 --> 04:04:21,150
ASHLEY: Only cold, random chance of what?
LIAM: Of the universe.

5165
04:04:21,150 --> 04:04:24,187
LAURA: No, because some people roll bad.
Some dice roll bad.

5166
04:04:24,187 --> 04:04:25,119
LIAM: There's no magic dice.

5167
04:04:25,119 --> 04:04:25,885
TALIESIN: There is only one god,
and it is--

5168
04:04:25,885 --> 04:04:26,796
TALIESIN AND MATT: The Dice God.
MARISHA: The Dice God!

5169
04:04:26,796 --> 04:04:28,086
TALIESIN: He is cruel and painful.

5170
04:04:28,086 --> 04:04:28,721
ORION: That is true.
When it comes to dice.

5171
04:04:28,721 --> 04:04:30,290
ASHLEY: Just, on principle,
I can't buy new dice

5172
04:04:30,290 --> 04:04:32,240
because I'm like, 
"it's not the dice."

5173
04:04:32,240 --> 04:04:33,524
LAURA: It is the dice!
LIAM: It's chance.

5174
04:04:33,524 --> 04:04:36,374
TALIESIN: You got a cool custom die.
MARISHA: I did get a custom die.

5175
04:04:36,374 --> 04:04:37,418
TALIESIN: She's got a custom die,
and it's awesome.

5176
04:04:37,418 --> 04:04:38,864
ORION: I'd pay for cursed dice,
so we're good.

5177
04:04:38,864 --> 04:04:42,685
SAM: Oh my god. That's daunting.

5178
04:04:42,685 --> 04:04:46,576
MATT: I did see a question someone asked.
Who has the most magical items? Tiberius.

5179
04:04:46,576 --> 04:04:48,001
TALIESIN: Tiberius.
MATT: Tiberius is a hoarder.

5180
04:04:48,001 --> 04:04:49,243
ORION: Wait, what happened?

5181
04:04:49,243 --> 04:04:51,116
MATT: Someone asked
who has the most magical items.

5182
04:04:51,116 --> 04:04:52,352
ORION: Yeah.

5183
04:04:52,352 --> 04:04:55,199
MARISHA: Someone asked me
what my favorite animal to turn into was.

5184
04:04:55,199 --> 04:05:01,050
I'd have to say it was probably my tiger,
my saber-toothed tiger.

5185
04:05:01,050 --> 04:05:01,903
ASHLEY: Minxie!
MARISHA AND TALIESIN: Minxie.

5186
04:05:01,903 --> 04:05:08,174
MARISHA: Minxie form, which Grog named
because Grog and I went on a--

5187
04:05:08,174 --> 04:05:09,044
TRAVIS: We intimidated this--

5188
04:05:09,044 --> 04:05:10,859
MARISHA: We went
on an intimidation mission,

5189
04:05:10,859 --> 04:05:15,903
and I was his pet tiger Minxie.

5190
04:05:15,903 --> 04:05:16,914
MATT: I like that.

5191
04:05:16,914 --> 04:05:23,606
The name of the one true dice god
is RNGesus. For random number generator.

5192
04:05:23,606 --> 04:05:24,830
TRAVIS: I love it.
TALIESIN: (laughs)

5193
04:05:24,830 --> 04:05:26,501
MARISHA: RNGesus!
MATT: That's great.

5194
04:05:26,501 --> 04:05:29,010
ASHLEY: Hogwarts houses?

5195
04:05:29,010 --> 04:05:31,896
LAURA: I'm a Hufflepuff.
MARISHA: What would RNGesus do?

5196
04:05:31,896 --> 04:05:33,360
TALIESIN: Hogwarts houses?
ORION: Is that a group question?

5197
04:05:33,360 --> 04:05:34,914
LIAM: Hogwarts houses, everyone?
Ravenclaw.

5198
04:05:34,914 --> 04:05:37,031
LAURA: Hufflepuff.
MATT: Hufflepuff.

5199
04:05:37,031 --> 04:05:39,036
MARISHA: Ravenclaw.
TALIESIN: Slytherin.

5200
04:05:39,036 --> 04:05:41,428
SAM: Never read it. Never saw it.
LAURA: (gasps)

5201
04:05:41,428 --> 04:05:42,587
SAM: Don't know anything about it.
Seriously.

5202
04:05:42,587 --> 04:05:45,424
LIAM: Bullshit.
SAM: Don't know anything about it.

5203
04:05:45,424 --> 04:05:46,213
TRAVIS: Nothing? Zero? Nada?
SAM: Don't know anything about it.

5204
04:05:46,213 --> 04:05:48,007
LAURA: Slytherin.
TALIESIN: Slytherin.

5205
04:05:48,007 --> 04:05:49,872
LIAM: Hufflepuff.
SAM: Is that like a--

5206
04:05:49,872 --> 04:05:50,825
LAURA: No, he's not a Hufflepuff.
He's a Slytherin.

5207
04:05:50,825 --> 04:05:52,425
LIAM: Sam?
MATT: You're a Slytherin.

5208
04:05:52,425 --> 04:05:55,215
LIAM: What the fuck
are you talking about?

5209
04:05:55,215 --> 04:05:57,393
LAURA: What are you?
ORION: I'm a Slytherin.

5210
04:05:57,393 --> 04:05:58,226
MATT: Hufflepuff!

5211
04:05:58,226 --> 04:05:59,604
SAM: I'm waiting to read it
to my son.

5212
04:05:59,604 --> 04:06:00,750
LAURA: We've got a lot of Slytherins
in our group.

5213
04:06:00,750 --> 04:06:04,216
MARISHA: No Gryffindors in this bitch.
Get out, Gryffindor. Get out.

5214
04:06:04,216 --> 04:06:07,520
TALIESIN: Actually,
when the final book came out,

5215
04:06:07,520 --> 04:06:09,972
we went to one of those Borders parties
and I had my little Slytherin robes.

5216
04:06:09,972 --> 04:06:11,129
I have Slytherin robes.

5217
04:06:11,129 --> 04:06:15,769
And all the Slytherin kids
were hanging outside of Borders

5218
04:06:15,769 --> 04:06:17,680
smoking clove cigarettes

5219
04:06:17,680 --> 04:06:20,534
and hustling little Gryffindor kids
for their book money.

5220
04:06:20,534 --> 04:06:21,844
(all laugh)

5221
04:06:21,844 --> 04:06:24,873
TALIESIN: It got really dark.
ASHLEY: That is awesome.

5222
04:06:24,873 --> 04:06:27,693
LIAM: Someone continues to ask.

5223
04:06:27,693 --> 04:06:31,711
In the last Q&amp;A,
I referenced going through a rough patch,

5224
04:06:31,711 --> 04:06:35,479
and they want to know
if I'm still going through it,

5225
04:06:35,479 --> 04:06:39,371
and how D&amp;D helped.

5226
04:06:39,371 --> 04:06:40,155
SAM: Okay, bye, guys.

5227
04:06:40,155 --> 04:06:41,139
(all laugh)

5228
04:06:41,139 --> 04:06:44,805
ORION: Oh, shit.
SAM: Good night.

5229
04:06:44,805 --> 04:06:49,475
LIAM: Yeah, I had a problem
with one of my ears.

5230
04:06:49,475 --> 04:06:55,443
It's like two years in.
No one has diagnosed it correctly.

5231
04:06:55,443 --> 04:06:58,954
In the beginning,
it was wildly disorienting.

5232
04:06:58,954 --> 04:07:00,898
I didn't know what was going on.

5233
04:07:00,898 --> 04:07:04,889
The symptoms were way more extreme
than what I'm going through now,

5234
04:07:04,889 --> 04:07:08,348
so it's not gone, but it's managed,

5235
04:07:08,348 --> 04:07:14,148
and I've found that running helps a lot,
which is why I run like a madman now.

5236
04:07:14,148 --> 04:07:18,369
And... the most important thing
in my life

5237
04:07:18,369 --> 04:07:21,186
is my wife and my two children.

5238
04:07:21,186 --> 04:07:25,630
The second most important thing
in my life

5239
04:07:25,630 --> 04:07:28,907
are the people on this couch
and this bench.

5240
04:07:28,907 --> 04:07:34,234
It's kind of eclipsed my job, for me,
in the last couple of years.

5241
04:07:34,234 --> 04:07:38,386
Looking forward to these nights
was huge for me,

5242
04:07:38,386 --> 04:07:41,127
both when I was in the thick of it
and still.

5243
04:07:41,127 --> 04:07:46,124
And I look at everyone here
as a second family.

5244
04:07:46,124 --> 04:07:50,563
ASHLEY: Oh, Liam.
MARISHA: We love you.

5245
04:07:50,563 --> 04:07:53,340
LAURA: I'm going to make
a Liam plushie.

5246
04:07:53,340 --> 04:07:54,217
ASHLEY: Yeah, man.

5247
04:07:54,217 --> 04:07:57,995
MATT: Love this guy here.
Look at all the hearts.

5248
04:07:57,995 --> 04:07:59,267
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, we've got to go
on Honesty Hour now.

5249
04:07:59,267 --> 04:08:04,045
Give them the whole shebang.
Ride the feels.

5250
04:08:04,045 --> 04:08:06,699
MATT: Has Pike tried healing? (laughs)

5251
04:08:06,699 --> 04:08:09,563
LAURA: It's a medicine roll
over and over and over again.

5252
04:08:09,563 --> 04:08:12,100
MATT: She heals quite a bit.
It's been awesome.

5253
04:08:12,100 --> 04:08:15,372
I've seen this a bit.
Advice for first-time DMs.

5254
04:08:15,372 --> 04:08:19,413
I'll give a bunch of that
if we end up doing the week off,

5255
04:08:19,413 --> 04:08:23,411
but quickly, I would say,

5256
04:08:23,411 --> 04:08:25,874
improvisational classes
help tremendously,

5257
04:08:25,874 --> 04:08:27,984
but being able to think on your feet.

5258
04:08:27,984 --> 04:08:31,155
Be open to players being creative.
Don't always shut people down.

5259
04:08:31,155 --> 04:08:33,425
It's not you against them. It can be,
but I like to think of it more open.

5260
04:08:33,425 --> 04:08:35,389
You can let them try
whatever they come up with,

5261
04:08:35,389 --> 04:08:37,580
but depending on how elaborate
or how ridiculous it is,

5262
04:08:37,580 --> 04:08:38,977
it might be really hard to happen.

5263
04:08:38,977 --> 04:08:42,519
And let them fail spectacularly,
because it makes a great story.

5264
04:08:42,519 --> 04:08:46,433
Build out a sheet
of a bunch of fantasy names

5265
04:08:46,433 --> 04:08:50,250
in case they go to a place
or meet an NPC you weren't expecting.

5266
04:08:50,250 --> 04:08:52,473
Then you can just pick a name

5267
04:08:52,473 --> 04:08:53,811
and make something up
on the spot about it

5268
04:08:53,811 --> 04:08:55,477
and take notes afterward.

5269
04:08:55,477 --> 04:08:56,623
LIAM: That's not
how you do it, though.

5270
04:08:56,623 --> 04:08:58,747
MATT: It's how I used to do it.
I wouldn't know where people would go

5271
04:08:58,747 --> 04:09:00,174
and I'd have a whole list of names
and I'd be like--

5272
04:09:00,174 --> 04:09:02,783
LIAM: You just have the universe
printed on the inside of your skull.

5273
04:09:02,783 --> 04:09:04,204
MATT: Kind of.

5274
04:09:04,204 --> 04:09:06,003
But I still have to pick out
of random places sometimes,

5275
04:09:06,003 --> 04:09:07,632
depending on what you guys do.

5276
04:09:07,632 --> 04:09:08,585
LIAM: Oh.

5277
04:09:08,585 --> 04:09:10,077
(all laugh)

5278
04:09:10,077 --> 04:09:11,008
TALIESIN: I don't want to know
how it's done.

5279
04:09:11,008 --> 04:09:11,718
LAURA: I know. No.

5280
04:09:11,718 --> 04:09:12,852
MARISHA: He's destroying the illusion.

5281
04:09:12,852 --> 04:09:15,478
LIAM: This all exists somewhere else,
doesn't it?

5282
04:09:15,478 --> 04:09:18,137
MATT: Most of it does.
I write a lot of it up,

5283
04:09:18,137 --> 04:09:21,160
but there are moments
where you have to pull out of the ether

5284
04:09:21,160 --> 04:09:24,107
because players go this way
and you're like, "Uh... all right,

5285
04:09:24,107 --> 04:09:25,033
"let's see where this goes."

5286
04:09:25,033 --> 04:09:27,434
But have fun.
Learn the rules well

5287
04:09:27,434 --> 04:09:30,353
because everyone's going to look
to you for rules.

5288
04:09:30,353 --> 04:09:33,114
Have fun. Let players play.
Let them be creative.

5289
04:09:33,114 --> 04:09:36,079
And let them succeed or fail
spectacularly.

5290
04:09:36,079 --> 04:09:38,873
MARISHA: Have we ever
thrown a total curveball at you,

5291
04:09:38,873 --> 04:09:40,724
where you've had to do that?

5292
04:09:40,724 --> 04:09:42,966
Where you've had to be like, 
"Uh... uh..."

5293
04:09:42,966 --> 04:09:46,965
MATT: A few times. I tend to prepare
pretty openly and loosely

5294
04:09:46,965 --> 04:09:48,882
so I can have 
some realm of understanding

5295
04:09:48,882 --> 04:09:50,066
where you guys are going.

5296
04:09:50,066 --> 04:09:50,736
MARISHA: Like that time

5297
04:09:50,736 --> 04:09:52,446
we sneaked in the back door
of the thieves' guild?

5298
04:09:52,446 --> 04:09:55,388
MATT: Yeah, that was--
LIAM: That was one of them.

5299
04:09:55,388 --> 04:09:56,841
LAURA: Because we just went
straight for it.

5300
04:09:56,841 --> 04:09:58,031
MATT: Yeah.

5301
04:09:58,031 --> 04:10:00,957
LIAM: What about when Grog decided
he wanted to vet people

5302
04:10:00,957 --> 04:10:02,192
to guard Greyskull Keep?

5303
04:10:02,192 --> 04:10:03,213
MATT: Yep.

5304
04:10:03,213 --> 04:10:03,713
LIAM: That was pulled
out of your ass, right?

5305
04:10:03,713 --> 04:10:05,286
MATT: A lot of that
was pulled out of my ass.

5306
04:10:05,286 --> 04:10:06,802
LIAM: Very well done.
TALIESIN: That was amazing.

5307
04:10:06,802 --> 04:10:07,295
LAURA: Oh, yeah.
ASHLEY: That was so great.

5308
04:10:07,295 --> 04:10:08,687
SAM: We haven't
gone to the keep yet, have we?

5309
04:10:08,687 --> 04:10:10,657
LAURA: I know, we haven't been back.

5310
04:10:10,657 --> 04:10:12,268
LIAM: Not since we left.
The last private game before this.

5311
04:10:12,268 --> 04:10:14,568
TRAVIS: We got the last six guards
that are totally awesome.

5312
04:10:14,568 --> 04:10:17,688
ASHLEY: Our warm, comfy beds
that we haven't gotten to sleep in yet.

5313
04:10:17,688 --> 04:10:20,305
LAURA: Ooh! Which Game of Thrones house
do we belong to?

5314
04:10:20,305 --> 04:10:23,033
TRAVIS: Baratheon.
LAURA: Stark.

5315
04:10:23,033 --> 04:10:24,490
ASHLEY: Probably Stark.
SAM: Slytherin.

5316
04:10:24,490 --> 04:10:25,761
(all laugh)

5317
04:10:25,761 --> 04:10:29,362
MARISHA: Slytherin. (laughs)
TALIESIN: Greyjoy.

5318
04:10:29,362 --> 04:10:34,579
ORION: Somebody asked if Tiberius
is inspired by a particular wizard

5319
04:10:34,579 --> 04:10:40,471
or something like that. He actually is.
Somebody mentioned Elminster.

5320
04:10:40,471 --> 04:10:41,933
LIAM: Tony Roberts.
ORION: Tony Roberts. That's exactly--

5321
04:10:41,933 --> 04:10:43,834
MATT AND ORION: (laugh)

5322
04:10:43,834 --> 04:10:46,877
ORION: That's going to be funny,
if I actually do that.

5323
04:10:46,877 --> 04:10:52,146
But no, Tiberius is actually
based off Elminster Aumar,

5324
04:10:52,146 --> 04:10:54,814
who I play in Neverwinter, the MMO.

5325
04:10:54,814 --> 04:10:57,967
I booked that 
before we started the group,

5326
04:10:57,967 --> 04:11:01,178
and then when I decided
to make him a sorcerer, I was like--

5327
04:11:01,178 --> 04:11:03,085
it was right at the same time, too--

5328
04:11:03,085 --> 04:11:04,458
MATT: Yeah, same time.

5329
04:11:04,458 --> 04:11:06,842
ORION: We just started to play,
and that happened, and...

5330
04:11:06,842 --> 04:11:14,679
yeah, so he's a dragonborn Elminster.

5331
04:11:14,679 --> 04:11:18,347
LIAM: Billy Mays, here,
for the Wizard's Academy!

5332
04:11:18,347 --> 04:11:20,609
ASHLEY: Billy Mays here,
with another fantastic creation.

5333
04:11:20,609 --> 04:11:22,524
SAM: Are Scanlan's feelings
for Pike mutual?

5334
04:11:22,524 --> 04:11:24,747
Pike, come on, give us a hint.

5335
04:11:24,747 --> 04:11:25,764
TRAVIS: Yeah, give us something.

5336
04:11:25,764 --> 04:11:27,114
MARISHA: I know, it's been two years,
and we don't know.

5337
04:11:27,114 --> 04:11:30,936
ASHLEY: I just don't know, because Pike's heart
might belong to somebody else.

5338
04:11:30,936 --> 04:11:31,443
LAURA: (gasps)

5339
04:11:31,443 --> 04:11:35,122
SAM: Wait, what?
I never heard this in two years!

5340
04:11:35,122 --> 04:11:41,912
ASHLEY: It's my backstory
as a character that's just personal.

5341
04:11:41,912 --> 04:11:45,557
It's my secret that I deal with,
whether people know it or not.

5342
04:11:45,567 --> 04:11:46,715
MATT: Intrigue!

5343
04:11:46,715 --> 04:11:48,587
TRAVIS: You're in love
with the Dread Pirate Roberts?

5344
04:11:48,587 --> 04:11:50,698
LAURA: I told everybody
my Trinket story.

5345
04:11:50,698 --> 04:11:53,058
ASHLEY: It's something
I'm still working out.

5346
04:11:53,058 --> 04:11:53,987
I haven't talked to Matt about it.

5347
04:11:53,987 --> 04:11:55,740
MATT: Let a girl keep her secrets.

5348
04:11:55,740 --> 04:11:59,044
SAM: Well, maybe Scanlan
has somebody else in mind, as well.

5349
04:11:59,044 --> 04:12:03,958
(all laugh)

5350
04:12:03,958 --> 04:12:05,638
TALIESIN: Well, this got uncomfortable
really quickly.

5351
04:12:05,638 --> 04:12:09,228
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)
ORION: Scanlan, denied!

5352
04:12:09,228 --> 04:12:11,923
MATT: I did not start
with Newgrounds Voices,

5353
04:12:11,923 --> 04:12:14,144
but I have been watching Newgrounds
since late 90s.

5354
04:12:14,144 --> 04:12:18,964
ASHLEY: But that doesn't mean
I couldn't possibly love Scanlan.

5355
04:12:18,964 --> 04:12:22,049
SAM: There's a chance?
ASHLEY: There might be a chance.

5356
04:12:22,049 --> 04:12:23,160
ORION: That's all you need.

5357
04:12:23,160 --> 04:12:25,552
SAM: I could change your heart
with enough spells.

5358
04:12:25,552 --> 04:12:27,375
ASHLEY: (laughs)

5359
04:12:27,375 --> 04:12:30,450
TRAVIS: Were you guys ever playing
during the D&amp;D scare of the '80s?

5360
04:12:30,450 --> 04:12:31,429
Whatever that means.

5361
04:12:31,429 --> 04:12:33,163
SAM: What does that mean?
ASHLEY: What is that?

5362
04:12:33,163 --> 04:12:33,663
MATT: Oh, the Chick tracts.

5363
04:12:33,663 --> 04:12:35,570
LAURA: Oh, when they said
it was satanic and stuff? No.

5364
04:12:35,570 --> 04:12:38,249
TALIESIN: No, I wasn't playing
until the '90s.

5365
04:12:38,249 --> 04:12:39,400
TRAVIS: No, we're all much younger.

5366
04:12:39,400 --> 04:12:42,122
LIAM: Maybe in '89,
I might have been.

5367
04:12:42,122 --> 04:12:45,290
TRAVIS: Important: how sexy is Grog?
As sexy as you want him to be.

5368
04:12:45,290 --> 04:12:47,250
MATT: Enjoy your boxes, buddy!

5369
04:12:47,250 --> 04:12:50,348
LIAM: Yeah, I started
When I was 10 or 11 in grade school,

5370
04:12:50,348 --> 04:12:53,569
which was the very end of the '80s.

5371
04:12:53,569 --> 04:12:57,082
TALIESIN: Oh my god,
this is going so fast.

5372
04:12:57,082 --> 04:12:58,078
TRAVIS: Can we have a Kima wedding?

5373
04:12:58,078 --> 04:13:01,194
LAURA: Oh, Grog and Kima.
TRAVIS: I'm working on her.

5374
04:13:01,194 --> 04:13:03,885
TALIESIN: Where do you get
your awesome shirts?

5375
04:13:03,885 --> 04:13:05,488
They want to know
where your shirts come from.

5376
04:13:05,488 --> 04:13:05,986
TRAVIS: Oh.

5377
04:13:05,986 --> 04:13:07,013
TALIESIN: The internet.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5378
04:13:07,013 --> 04:13:09,733
ORION: We did start this campaign
in a different thing.

5379
04:13:09,733 --> 04:13:14,906
We started in Pathfinder
and for a lot of us, me included,

5380
04:13:14,906 --> 04:13:16,947
that was the first time playing D&amp;D,

5381
04:13:16,947 --> 04:13:19,858
so Matthew home-brewed
everything in Pathfinder,

5382
04:13:19,858 --> 04:13:23,520
and then right before
we decided to do this,

5383
04:13:23,520 --> 04:13:27,125
we switched over to 5th Edition.

5384
04:13:27,125 --> 04:13:30,647
MATT: It was better
for a group this size.

5385
04:13:30,647 --> 04:13:31,951
I think Pathfinder with eight players

5386
04:13:31,951 --> 04:13:34,243
becomes too weighed-down
with floating modifiers,

5387
04:13:34,243 --> 04:13:37,575
and it becomes very difficult
to keep fluid.

5388
04:13:37,575 --> 04:13:40,052
It's fine if you're a bunch of friends 
at home playing for eight hours,

5389
04:13:40,052 --> 04:13:43,582
but when you're playing
in front of an audience of thousands

5390
04:13:43,582 --> 04:13:44,425
on the internet every week,

5391
04:13:44,425 --> 04:13:47,098
we have to use a system
that makes combat go a lot quicker,

5392
04:13:47,098 --> 04:13:49,908
so 5th Edition was the way to go.

5393
04:13:49,908 --> 04:13:53,026
LIAM: I see a good one.
I have an answer, I'll start.

5394
04:13:53,026 --> 04:13:54,375
MATT: There's your emote, Laura.
LIAM: There it is.

5395
04:13:54,375 --> 04:13:59,074
LAURA: Oh, Greg did it.
Oh, with a little porty emote.

5396
04:13:59,074 --> 04:14:02,934
That's cute. Thanks, Greg Miller.

5397
04:14:02,934 --> 04:14:04,324
TRAVIS: You and a wiener onscreen.

5398
04:14:04,324 --> 04:14:06,367
LIAM: Someone wants to know

5399
04:14:06,367 --> 04:14:09,882
what our favorite moment has been
since we started Critical Role.

5400
04:14:09,882 --> 04:14:15,448
Mine was sneaking
into the illithid captain's room

5401
04:14:15,448 --> 04:14:21,181
with Scanlan, holding a bucket of poop.
I was scared to death.

5402
04:14:21,181 --> 04:14:23,966
I didn't know what was going to happen,
and it went great.

5403
04:14:23,966 --> 04:14:24,898
MATT: Yeah, you guys rolled really well.

5404
04:14:24,898 --> 04:14:27,849
LIAM: It was electric. That was mine.
Anybody else?

5405
04:14:27,849 --> 04:14:29,885
TALIESIN: My first crit with my new gun,

5406
04:14:29,885 --> 04:14:31,827
which was also my first kill
with my new gun.

5407
04:14:31,827 --> 04:14:32,462
LAURA: That was so awesome.

5408
04:14:32,462 --> 04:14:35,284
TALIESIN: That felt really good.
That felt good.

5409
04:14:35,284 --> 04:14:37,501
MATT: Taking out the abyssal abomination.

5410
04:14:37,501 --> 04:14:39,311
TALIESIN: That felt nice.

5411
04:14:39,311 --> 04:14:43,031
SAM: I think, for me,
I enjoyed springing Keyleth out of jail

5412
04:14:43,031 --> 04:14:45,153
by convincing the guards
she had pubic lice.

5413
04:14:45,153 --> 04:14:46,178
TRAVIS: (laughs)
MARISHA: Yes.

5414
04:14:46,178 --> 04:14:49,067
MATT: Yeah, I forgot about that.
LAURA: Was that during the game?

5415
04:14:49,067 --> 04:14:51,716
TALIESIN: That was not during the show.
LAURA: Oh, that was before the show.

5416
04:14:51,716 --> 04:14:57,025
SAM: Before the show. Oh, okay.

5417
04:14:57,025 --> 04:14:58,575
MARISHA: That was a good one, though.
LAURA: That was a good one.

5418
04:14:58,575 --> 04:14:59,637
MARISHA: Was that the same time

5419
04:14:59,637 --> 04:15:02,200
where I ran at the wall
and started foaming at the mouth?

5420
04:15:02,200 --> 04:15:03,286
SAM: You were crazy.

5421
04:15:03,286 --> 04:15:06,888
LAURA: Yeah, and we had to bust you out.
That, and Percy was an awesome lawyer.

5422
04:15:06,888 --> 04:15:08,083
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right!

5423
04:15:08,083 --> 04:15:12,089
SAM: We had a whole Phoenix Wright party.
TALIESIN: I'd forgotten about that.

5424
04:15:12,089 --> 04:15:14,851
MARISHA: We basically
took the insanity plea

5425
04:15:14,851 --> 04:15:16,899
to get me out of prison, as a team.

5426
04:15:16,899 --> 04:15:19,402
LAURA: That's a good question, Matt.
I just saw, if we all die

5427
04:15:19,402 --> 04:15:20,775
or if some of us die,

5428
04:15:20,775 --> 04:15:24,154
do we have to roll in at a level one,
or do we start at a higher level?

5429
04:15:24,154 --> 04:15:27,536
MATT: No, you guys would start
a level behind the rest of the group.

5430
04:15:27,536 --> 04:15:29,257
The detriment to it is
you would be a level lower.

5431
04:15:29,257 --> 04:15:32,843
That is the drawback of dying
or losing a character,

5432
04:15:32,843 --> 04:15:35,346
is you would be a level or a half-level
behind the rest of the party.

5433
04:15:35,346 --> 04:15:37,146
LAURA: On top of losing a character.

5434
04:15:37,146 --> 04:15:38,398
SAM: New character would be rough, man.
ASHLEY: That would suck.

5435
04:15:38,398 --> 04:15:40,713
MATT: It's possible.
You guys all know it.

5436
04:15:40,713 --> 04:15:41,688
We all knew it going in.

5437
04:15:41,688 --> 04:15:44,368
SAM: Can I come back
as Spider-Man or something?

5438
04:15:44,368 --> 04:15:45,988
MATT: I'm not going to hold that back.

5439
04:15:45,988 --> 04:15:47,502
TALIESIN: You're not Spider-Man?

5440
04:15:47,502 --> 04:15:48,897
MATT: I'm not going to be Marvel
in this bitch, okay?

5441
04:15:48,897 --> 04:15:49,784
I'm not going to be like,
"oh, death.

5442
04:15:49,784 --> 04:15:53,288
"I can take it back any time,
and it doesn't matter anymore." No.

5443
04:15:53,288 --> 04:15:54,409
TRAVIS: Do you design specific things
for an hourglass?

5444
04:15:54,409 --> 04:15:57,934
Are there particular scenarios
that require it?

5445
04:15:57,934 --> 04:16:01,104
MATT: There are.
It's harder to do in the Underdark.

5446
04:16:01,104 --> 04:16:04,134
There aren't so many traps
or timed circumstances.

5447
04:16:04,134 --> 04:16:05,560
I like the hourglass

5448
04:16:05,560 --> 04:16:09,242
for certain circumstances
that have a very definite time limit,

5449
04:16:09,242 --> 04:16:12,519
and I do think up what the challenge is,
what type of skills would work,

5450
04:16:12,519 --> 04:16:14,572
or let the players come up
with creative ways

5451
04:16:14,572 --> 04:16:16,650
that they can apply their skills
to a situation to succeed,

5452
04:16:16,650 --> 04:16:20,553
and I figure out,
loosely off the 4th Edition rules,

5453
04:16:20,553 --> 04:16:22,383
where I have number of successes 
vs number of failures

5454
04:16:22,383 --> 04:16:24,615
in that period of time,

5455
04:16:24,615 --> 04:16:26,381
and if they don't manage to do it
in that time period, it's a failure.

5456
04:16:26,381 --> 04:16:30,096
I think it's fun.
It builds the tension,

5457
04:16:30,096 --> 04:16:32,756
and the party goes, "oh, shit!
We've got to do this now!"

5458
04:16:32,756 --> 04:16:35,590
I love it. Hourglass is awesome.

5459
04:16:35,590 --> 04:16:38,845
LAURA: Do we play
any other tabletop games?

5460
04:16:38,845 --> 04:16:40,591
SAM: Risk.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5461
04:16:40,591 --> 04:16:41,861
ASHLEY: Risk.

5462
04:16:41,861 --> 04:16:45,046
MARISHA: How do you mean, tabletop?
All tabletop?

5463
04:16:45,046 --> 04:16:46,776
LIAM: Board games, anything.

5464
04:16:46,776 --> 04:16:49,522
ORION: I'm a big
Magic: The Gathering guy. We play.

5465
04:16:49,522 --> 04:16:50,246
MARISHA: Yeah,
we like Magic: The Gathering.

5466
04:16:50,246 --> 04:16:52,825
ASHLEY: Settlers of Catan.
MARISHA: Settlers of Catan!

5467
04:16:52,825 --> 04:16:55,458
MATT: Mansions of Madness.
TALIESIN: Mansions of Madness. Yeah.

5468
04:16:55,458 --> 04:16:59,303
MARISHA: I think the four of us here
are all Warmachine Hordes players.

5469
04:16:59,303 --> 04:17:00,528
MATT: Yeah.

5470
04:17:00,528 --> 04:17:03,516
LIAM: I've been playing
the board game Dungeon,

5471
04:17:03,516 --> 04:17:05,565
which is D&amp;D-inspired.

5472
04:17:05,565 --> 04:17:07,167
Someone also asked, what's a good way

5473
04:17:07,167 --> 04:17:10,713
to get your wife or your kids
or friends involved.

5474
04:17:10,713 --> 04:17:15,561
I yanked my eight-year-old son in
by playing Dungeon with him,

5475
04:17:15,561 --> 04:17:17,746
and he totally got into it
because of Dungeon,

5476
04:17:17,746 --> 04:17:20,577
and now I am DMing a game
for three eight-year-olds.

5477
04:17:20,577 --> 04:17:22,157
MATT: Which is awesome.

5478
04:17:22,157 --> 04:17:24,192
LIAM: It's like D&amp;D-light
in a board game,

5479
04:17:24,192 --> 04:17:24,996
and if they like the board game,

5480
04:17:24,996 --> 04:17:28,112
you can say, "you know, if you like this,
we can ratchet up a bit."

5481
04:17:28,112 --> 04:17:29,879
MARISHA: Yeah,
there's also D&amp;D board games.

5482
04:17:29,879 --> 04:17:38,663
Branded D&amp;D board games that are fun.
Mini dungeon delvers. They're fun.

5483
04:17:38,663 --> 04:17:40,556
ORION: I will be on Mulligan soon,

5484
04:17:40,556 --> 04:17:46,677
and I like red and white, blue and black,
and all the colors of the rainbow.

5485
04:17:46,677 --> 04:17:48,822
LAURA: I just did that show with Wil.

5486
04:17:48,822 --> 04:17:53,732
Titansgrave, which is
a different tabletop RPG,

5487
04:17:53,732 --> 04:17:56,618
and it's really fun.

5488
04:17:56,618 --> 04:17:58,706
MATT: How do I handle 
experience leveling in this game?

5489
04:17:58,706 --> 04:18:02,180
At certain milestones,
when characters have a chance to rest--

5490
04:18:02,180 --> 04:18:04,744
have a breather
or sleep for the evening--

5491
04:18:04,744 --> 04:18:08,450
then that's when experience
is divvied out for the next session.

5492
04:18:08,450 --> 04:18:10,207
Characters don't level
in the middle of a battle, or anything,

5493
04:18:10,207 --> 04:18:14,229
but I keep track of it,
usually on a session by session basis,

5494
04:18:14,229 --> 04:18:16,403
and if there's a moment of rest,
then people can level up.

5495
04:18:16,403 --> 04:18:17,661
I also saw a question,

5496
04:18:17,661 --> 04:18:22,030
when did Percy build the Bad News,
and how long did it take?

5497
04:18:22,030 --> 04:18:25,739
TALIESIN: Bad News was built
during the changeover to 5th Edition.

5498
04:18:25,739 --> 04:18:29,203
Took about--

5499
04:18:29,203 --> 04:18:29,933
MATT: Four or five months.

5500
04:18:29,933 --> 04:18:31,633
TALIESIN: Yeah,
it was about four or five months.

5501
04:18:31,633 --> 04:18:33,120
MATT: In-game.

5502
04:18:33,120 --> 04:18:34,045
TALIESIN: In-game.

5503
04:18:34,045 --> 04:18:38,070
Sitting at a table just tinkering
and tinkering.

5504
04:18:38,070 --> 04:18:40,060
TRAVIS: Somebody asked
how I became a goliath

5505
04:18:40,060 --> 04:18:43,064
because it's not an official race
in the book. Is it not an official race?

5506
04:18:43,064 --> 04:18:45,176
LIAM: It's now in 5th Edition,
in one of the added books.

5507
04:18:45,176 --> 04:18:47,895
TRAVIS: Now it is.
I think I asked Matt

5508
04:18:47,895 --> 04:18:50,553
what the bigger creatures were
in the world

5509
04:18:50,553 --> 04:18:51,414
and he said orcs and other things

5510
04:18:51,414 --> 04:18:53,955
and he also said there were goliaths
that were half and half

5511
04:18:53,955 --> 04:18:55,803
and I was like "can I be that?"
He was like, "sure."

5512
04:18:55,803 --> 04:18:56,798
MATT: Yeah.

5513
04:18:56,798 --> 04:18:58,815
TRAVIS: That was a thing
I asked Marisha once,

5514
04:18:58,815 --> 04:18:59,953
during our first game, was,

5515
04:18:59,953 --> 04:19:05,121
"Wait, I can do whatever I want?"
"Kind of."

5516
04:19:05,121 --> 04:19:08,039
MARISHA: Do whatever you want.
It's awesome.

5517
04:19:08,039 --> 04:19:11,510
TRAVIS: You can try!
MARISHA: Fun, imaginative world.

5518
04:19:11,510 --> 04:19:15,895
MATT: How is Critical Role going,
compared to how you envisioned it?

5519
04:19:15,895 --> 04:19:20,005
SAM: Pretty good!
ORION: Envisioned it?

5520
04:19:20,005 --> 04:19:23,650
MATT: One of our biggest fears
when this thing came to our attention,

5521
04:19:23,650 --> 04:19:25,244
when Geek &amp; Sundry contacted us,

5522
04:19:25,244 --> 04:19:27,419
was we didn't want it
to change the game for us.

5523
04:19:27,419 --> 04:19:29,792
We did this together for fun.

5524
04:19:29,792 --> 04:19:31,678
We enjoyed it, and it was just
a wonderful thing for us for two years.

5525
04:19:31,678 --> 04:19:32,649
ORION: Two years plus, man.

5526
04:19:32,649 --> 04:19:35,644
MATT: And so our biggest fear
was it changing that dynamic,

5527
04:19:35,644 --> 04:19:38,961
and so we tried to be very careful
that we didn't alter how we played,

5528
04:19:38,961 --> 04:19:43,022
and didn't change the format, really,
other than having cameras.

5529
04:19:43,022 --> 04:19:45,049
LIAM: We didn't want it
to turn into a reality TV show.

5530
04:19:45,049 --> 04:19:48,956
LAURA: I was worried
even when we were figuring out

5531
04:19:48,956 --> 04:19:50,636
the setup of the tables,
how it was going to work,

5532
04:19:50,636 --> 04:19:53,632
that being far away from each other
was going to screw things up,

5533
04:19:53,632 --> 04:19:56,068
but it's just like
when we were playing at our house

5534
04:19:56,068 --> 04:19:57,590
across the table from each other.

5535
04:19:57,590 --> 04:19:58,919
MATT: Just a little more distance.

5536
04:19:58,919 --> 04:20:03,186
There's been very little change,
except we have other people now

5537
04:20:03,186 --> 04:20:05,318
that we don't have to spend hours
telling them,

5538
04:20:05,318 --> 04:20:07,995
"oh, what we do is we play this,
and this is what happened."

5539
04:20:07,995 --> 04:20:08,945
You guys already know
because you watched it,

5540
04:20:08,945 --> 04:20:09,412
and it's awesome.

5541
04:20:09,412 --> 04:20:10,367
MARISHA: Yeah, that's true.

5542
04:20:10,367 --> 04:20:13,041
LIAM: There's a light goose
to the energy

5543
04:20:13,041 --> 04:20:14,507
because it feels
like we're doing theater,

5544
04:20:14,507 --> 04:20:16,532
which is the one added difference
that I like,

5545
04:20:16,532 --> 04:20:19,231
because when we played at home,
we would have moments

5546
04:20:19,231 --> 04:20:21,826
where we'd go into lulls
or get tired or something,

5547
04:20:21,826 --> 04:20:24,447
and that doesn't happen here.

5548
04:20:24,447 --> 04:20:25,987
LAURA: We're also only playing
for three hours, as opposed to eight.

5549
04:20:25,987 --> 04:20:28,025
ORION: And I'm drinking a lot less.

5550
04:20:28,025 --> 04:20:30,938
TALIESIN: It's much more kinetic.

5551
04:20:30,938 --> 04:20:33,730
TRAVIS: How do you handle
Percy crafting things?

5552
04:20:33,730 --> 04:20:38,944
TALIESIN: I make a standard roll,
plus-- what is it?

5553
04:20:38,944 --> 04:20:43,884
Is it dexterity
and a modifier on top of that?

5554
04:20:43,884 --> 04:20:47,150
MATT: Yeah, he's proficient
with a tinkering kit, essentially,

5555
04:20:47,150 --> 04:20:49,759
so it's a proficiency bonus
on top of that,

5556
04:20:49,759 --> 04:20:52,712
and what it will be is, 
he'll tell me

5557
04:20:52,712 --> 04:20:54,749
or describe to me the schematics
of what he's trying to build

5558
04:20:54,749 --> 04:20:56,016
and what materials
he has at his disposal,

5559
04:20:56,016 --> 04:20:57,168
or ask me what he needs for it--

5560
04:20:57,168 --> 04:21:00,909
TALIESIN: I built Keyleth
a special staff, ages ago.

5561
04:21:00,909 --> 04:21:02,059
MARISHA: Yes.

5562
04:21:02,059 --> 04:21:03,646
MATT: So if he has the materials,
I'll tell him how expensive it is,

5563
04:21:03,646 --> 04:21:05,829
or how to get the materials,
and he attempts the roll.

5564
04:21:05,829 --> 04:21:07,844
If he fails, wastes all the materials.
It's a complete waste.

5565
04:21:07,844 --> 04:21:09,406
TALIESIN: Man, I've been doing a lot,
lately.

5566
04:21:09,406 --> 04:21:11,325
MATT: If he rolls decent,
it's functional, for the most part,

5567
04:21:11,325 --> 04:21:13,406
but the thing with tinkering is

5568
04:21:13,406 --> 04:21:15,945
it doesn't always quite
work how you want.

5569
04:21:15,945 --> 04:21:19,895
If he rolls really well,
then it's pretty damn good.

5570
04:21:19,895 --> 04:21:22,237
TALIESIN: And I get a bonus
if I'm actually back at the keep.

5571
04:21:22,237 --> 04:21:24,408
MATT: At the workshop.
The keep has a workshop for him.

5572
04:21:24,408 --> 04:21:26,855
LAURA: I saw a thing
asking what was it like

5573
04:21:26,855 --> 04:21:28,298
shooting the opening credits.

5574
04:21:28,298 --> 04:21:29,552
(all laugh)

5575
04:21:29,552 --> 04:21:31,322
MARISHA: That was fun.

5576
04:21:31,322 --> 04:21:32,882
LAURA: Being in costume for it
and everything.

5577
04:21:32,882 --> 04:21:33,773
LIAM: Silly.

5578
04:21:33,773 --> 04:21:34,441
LAURA: Which is really funny,

5579
04:21:34,441 --> 04:21:36,264
because we did not plan 
on being in costume.

5580
04:21:36,264 --> 04:21:37,846
TRAVIS: No, we thought
maybe one or two things.

5581
04:21:37,846 --> 04:21:40,706
LAURA: Like a bracer or carry a weapon.

5582
04:21:40,706 --> 04:21:43,154
TALIESIN: And then Matt and I
emptied out our Ren Faire closets.

5583
04:21:43,154 --> 04:21:43,404
MATT: Yep.

5584
04:21:43,404 --> 04:21:45,849
TRAVIS: And then alcohol made its way in.

5585
04:21:45,849 --> 04:21:48,234
LAURA: We all showed up and were like,
"oh, this is cool! Let's put this on!"

5586
04:21:48,234 --> 04:21:50,401
MARISHA: Yeah, it just kept getting
more and more involved.

5587
04:21:50,401 --> 04:21:52,554
ORION: Everybody give a quick huzzah
to Jareth.

5588
04:21:52,554 --> 04:21:54,673
ALL: Huzzah to Jareth!

5589
04:21:54,673 --> 04:21:57,435
ORION: He graduated high school today.

5590
04:21:57,435 --> 04:21:58,463
LAURA: Oh, nice! Congratulations.
MATT: Congratulations, buddy.

5591
04:21:58,463 --> 04:21:58,713
MARISHA: Congratulations!

5592
04:21:58,713 --> 04:22:00,234
TRAVIS: Somebody asked,
"if you accept fan art,

5593
04:22:00,234 --> 04:22:04,120
"would you also accept someone
making fight music for the game?"

5594
04:22:04,120 --> 04:22:04,747
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: Totally.

5595
04:22:04,747 --> 04:22:06,874
TALIESIN: We don't want to tell anybody
what not to do.

5596
04:22:06,874 --> 04:22:08,482
SAM: I would accept
a small statue of Pike

5597
04:22:08,482 --> 04:22:11,482
that I can hold near my breast.

5598
04:22:11,482 --> 04:22:12,378
TALIESIN: I don't want to see that.

5599
04:22:12,378 --> 04:22:14,760
LAURA: Didn't you have one made?
SAM: I did have one made in-game--

5600
04:22:14,760 --> 04:22:16,942
ASHLEY: And that's what saved my life.

5601
04:22:16,942 --> 04:22:19,254
LAURA: (gasps) That's right, it did!
It saved her life.

5602
04:22:19,254 --> 04:22:21,766
SAM: I made two. I made one of me
that I gave to you,

5603
04:22:21,766 --> 04:22:23,105
and one of you that I keep with me.

5604
04:22:23,105 --> 04:22:24,291
TALIESIN: Is it overwhelming
having 8,000 people watching?

5605
04:22:24,291 --> 04:22:26,307
TRAVIS: No.
TALIESIN: No.

5606
04:22:26,307 --> 04:22:29,387
MATT: It's not overwhelming.
It's really cool.

5607
04:22:29,387 --> 04:22:31,535
It's good to know
there's people out there

5608
04:22:31,535 --> 04:22:33,369
that have any interest
in Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5609
04:22:33,369 --> 04:22:34,785
I grew up an indoor kid.

5610
04:22:34,785 --> 04:22:37,657
I was not quite sure
if I could tell people I play this game,

5611
04:22:37,657 --> 04:22:40,872
and now people
are much more open to the idea,

5612
04:22:40,872 --> 04:22:41,926
like, "oh, Dungeons &amp; Dragons!"

5613
04:22:41,926 --> 04:22:44,970
It used to be like,
"you play D&amp;D? What the shit?"

5614
04:22:44,970 --> 04:22:46,722
Now it's, "you play D&amp;D? 
What's it like?"

5615
04:22:46,722 --> 04:22:48,365
It's much more open. It's great.

5616
04:22:48,365 --> 04:22:49,071
LIAM: One of our favorite things

5617
04:22:49,071 --> 04:22:52,160
about all the feedback
we're getting through social media

5618
04:22:52,160 --> 04:22:54,316
is how many of you guys
are starting to play the game.

5619
04:22:54,316 --> 04:22:57,374
ALL: Yeah, that's cool.
ASHLEY: That's awesome.

5620
04:22:57,374 --> 04:23:00,643
MARISHA: Everyone should try D&amp;D.

5621
04:23:00,643 --> 04:23:01,944
TALIESIN: The world would be
a better place with more D&amp;D.

5622
04:23:01,944 --> 04:23:03,896
MARISHA: The world would be
a better place with more D&amp;D.

5623
04:23:03,896 --> 04:23:04,844
LIAM: Somebody asked

5624
04:23:04,844 --> 04:23:10,684
what each of our favorite thing
about playing D&amp;D is.

5625
04:23:10,684 --> 04:23:12,044
The people.

5626
04:23:12,044 --> 04:23:16,647
We all do a decent amount of gaming
in this group,

5627
04:23:16,647 --> 04:23:20,643
so this just feels like the most social,
friend-oriented--

5628
04:23:20,643 --> 04:23:24,315
it just feels real
because we're hashing it out together

5629
04:23:24,315 --> 04:23:26,033
instead of doing this.

5630
04:23:26,033 --> 04:23:28,141
TRAVIS: Personalities are fucking great.
ORION: Which isn't bad!

5631
04:23:28,141 --> 04:23:33,778
LIAM: Which is great! We all do it,
but it's a nice counter-balance.

5632
04:23:33,778 --> 04:23:38,812
ORION: Somebody asked why Tiberius
is so loyal to Keyleth.

5633
04:23:38,812 --> 04:23:43,288
Tiberius comes from a presidential family.

5634
04:23:43,288 --> 04:23:48,652
A family of political power,
of high-seating in his land,

5635
04:23:48,652 --> 04:23:57,126
so he's very honorable,
and Keyleth is royalty in his eyes.

5636
04:23:57,126 --> 04:24:01,690
He didn't know, because that
was a reveal for Keyleth's character.

5637
04:24:01,690 --> 04:24:04,650
I think it was a year and a half,
we were playing,

5638
04:24:04,650 --> 04:24:05,115
and then you revealed it.

5639
04:24:05,115 --> 04:24:07,762
MARISHA: It was a while
before I told you guys I was a princess.

5640
04:24:07,762 --> 04:24:09,152
LIAM: Hey, it's Scott White.
"Happy 10th episode." Hey, Scott!

5641
04:24:09,152 --> 04:24:13,147
ALL: Scott!
MATT: Thanks for coming!

5642
04:24:13,147 --> 04:24:15,228
LIAM: Actor Scott White.

5643
04:24:15,228 --> 04:24:16,864
TRAVIS: People asked if this will be
on Video On Demand

5644
04:24:16,864 --> 04:24:19,866
or if people miss it,
how do they see it?

5645
04:24:19,866 --> 04:24:21,328
SAM: Pay Per View.

5646
04:24:21,328 --> 04:24:26,060
ZAC: It'll be up on the website.
MARISHA: On the website.

5647
04:24:26,100 --> 04:24:27,958
TALIESIN: I think we're
just both really snooty,

5648
04:24:27,958 --> 04:24:29,240
which is why we kind of hang out.

5649
04:24:29,240 --> 04:24:30,599
LAURA: Dude, Scott!

5650
04:24:30,599 --> 04:24:33,409
I was just talking to Amanda Wyatt today
about your concert the other night,

5651
04:24:33,409 --> 04:24:34,763
and I wish I would have been there.

5652
04:24:34,763 --> 04:24:35,874
SAM: No.
LAURA: Different one?

5653
04:24:35,874 --> 04:24:37,619
SAM: No, it's a totally different
Scott White.

5654
04:24:37,619 --> 04:24:40,462
TALIESIN: Someone asked if it's weird
not being a fantasy character

5655
04:24:40,462 --> 04:24:45,106
in a fantasy setting,
for Percy as a gunslinger.

5656
04:24:45,106 --> 04:24:47,154
I really like it.
I will actually admit

5657
04:24:47,154 --> 04:24:50,337
that I've always been fascinated
by that moment in history

5658
04:24:50,337 --> 04:24:52,721
where suddenly we went
from bows and arrows to guns,

5659
04:24:52,721 --> 04:24:54,151
so I really like the idea

5660
04:24:54,151 --> 04:24:57,999
of being the guy
who made that terrible mistake

5661
04:24:57,999 --> 04:25:04,223
and had this really bad idea,
and I'm really enjoying...

5662
04:25:04,223 --> 04:25:05,856
MARISHA: RPing that guy.

5663
04:25:05,856 --> 04:25:07,620
TALIESIN: RPing that guy,
and trying to figure out

5664
04:25:07,620 --> 04:25:10,685
what would drive a human being
to do something so stupid

5665
04:25:10,685 --> 04:25:13,230
as to invent a gun.

5666
04:25:13,230 --> 04:25:14,388
LIAM: I love that we have Percy
in our group.

5667
04:25:14,388 --> 04:25:15,537
MARISHA: Which I think is why Percy
is one of my favorite characters.

5668
04:25:15,537 --> 04:25:19,562
TALIESIN: He's really screwing
the entire future, at this point.

5669
04:25:19,562 --> 04:25:21,041
MATT: Yeah.

5670
04:25:21,041 --> 04:25:22,373
ORION: Somebody asked us a fun question.

5671
04:25:22,373 --> 04:25:26,526
If each of us could have a familiar
like Trinket,

5672
04:25:26,526 --> 04:25:28,676
if we could have our own animal,
what would it be?

5673
04:25:28,676 --> 04:25:30,128
MARISHA: Like as our character?

5674
04:25:30,128 --> 04:25:32,637
LAURA: Like a pet?
MARISHA: In-character?

5675
04:25:32,637 --> 04:25:34,668
ORION: Tiberius, of course,

5676
04:25:34,668 --> 04:25:40,942
would have a small dragonite
or pseudodragon. Definitely.

5677
04:25:40,942 --> 04:25:42,087
TALIESIN: Flying squirrel.

5678
04:25:42,087 --> 04:25:44,054
LIAM: That's what I
was going to fucking say.

5679
04:25:44,054 --> 04:25:44,714
TALIESIN: Bam!

5680
04:25:44,714 --> 04:25:46,852
ORION: Oh, and the dragon's name
would be Monty.

5681
04:25:46,852 --> 04:25:50,621
MARISHA: Keyleth would probably
have a mountain lion.

5682
04:25:50,621 --> 04:25:53,002
Keyleth likes cats,
and she lived in the mountains,

5683
04:25:53,002 --> 04:25:55,944
so something native
would have been mountain lion-y.

5684
04:25:55,944 --> 04:25:57,154
ORION: Thanks, Effigy.

5685
04:25:57,154 --> 04:26:00,211
MATT: Thanks for staying, Sam!

5686
04:26:00,211 --> 04:26:02,411
SAM: Oh, yeah. Bye, guys!
ALL: Bye, Sam.

5687
04:26:02,411 --> 04:26:03,532
MATT: Sam's got to run 
back to his family.

5688
04:26:03,532 --> 04:26:05,641
TALIESIN: Sam!

5689
04:26:05,641 --> 04:26:07,774
Text me the change in schedule,
if you get a second.

5690
04:26:07,774 --> 04:26:10,150
ZAC: I actually think
that's a pretty good time

5691
04:26:10,150 --> 04:26:11,443
to start winding this down.

5692
04:26:11,443 --> 04:26:12,395
LIAM: Yeah.

5693
04:26:12,395 --> 04:26:13,323
ORION: It's only 11:30.

5694
04:26:13,323 --> 04:26:15,052
ZAC: It's been an hour-long Q&amp;A,
so I think it's a pretty good time.

5695
04:26:15,052 --> 04:26:16,507
MARISHA: It's been an hour?

5696
04:26:16,507 --> 04:26:18,160
MATT: All right,
so we'll get a few more questions here,

5697
04:26:18,160 --> 04:26:20,438
and then we'll go ahead
and close it on this, guys.

5698
04:26:20,438 --> 04:26:22,683
MARISHA: Going back to the question
of my favorite thing about D&amp;D,

5699
04:26:22,683 --> 04:26:27,191
because that kind of got segued out.

5700
04:26:27,191 --> 04:26:29,069
Aside from the people,

5701
04:26:29,069 --> 04:26:31,413
I think that it's something
really fantastic--

5702
04:26:31,413 --> 04:26:35,213
not to sound cheesy-- and magical

5703
04:26:35,213 --> 04:26:39,505
when a group of grown adults
can get together

5704
04:26:39,505 --> 04:26:43,979
and use their imagination
and have an amazing time,

5705
04:26:43,979 --> 04:26:48,158
and my favorite thing
about Dungeons &amp; Dragons

5706
04:26:48,158 --> 04:26:52,272
is when you walk away from it,
and especially after you've slept on it

5707
04:26:52,272 --> 04:26:54,983
and after you meditate on it,
it's pretty much real.

5708
04:26:54,983 --> 04:26:59,891
It's just as real as other things we do
in our day-to-day lives.

5709
04:26:59,891 --> 04:27:02,655
If you guys noticed how excited we got

5710
04:27:02,655 --> 04:27:06,865
when we were like, "oh my god,
you guys haven't met Gilmore yet."

5711
04:27:06,865 --> 04:27:14,084
And all of us went, "oh my god. Gilmore."
And we all got excited over an NPC.

5712
04:27:14,084 --> 04:27:16,981
ORION: Nothing that exists, really.

5713
04:27:16,981 --> 04:27:18,934
LAURA: I dream about our characters.

5714
04:27:18,934 --> 04:27:20,213
MARISHA: Yeah, I do, too.
Yeah, I have dreams.

5715
04:27:20,213 --> 04:27:21,667
LAURA: Isn't that crazy!

5716
04:27:21,667 --> 04:27:23,837
MARISHA: Because for us, Gilmore is real,

5717
04:27:23,837 --> 04:27:27,875
and Pike is real, which is why
we all fucking cried our eyes out

5718
04:27:27,875 --> 04:27:29,868
when Pike died.

5719
04:27:29,868 --> 04:27:31,849
TALIESIN: Is it my imagination
that Gilmore is blond, by the way?

5720
04:27:31,849 --> 04:27:34,029
Does everybody else see Gilmore
as very blond?

5721
04:27:34,029 --> 04:27:35,549
LAURA: Oh, I pictured Gilmore
with black hair.

5722
04:27:35,549 --> 04:27:37,291
ASHLEY: I pictured him
with black hair, too.

5723
04:27:37,291 --> 04:27:39,466
TALIESIN: I saw big curly blond hair.

5724
04:27:39,466 --> 04:27:41,264
LAURA: Oh, I like that!

5725
04:27:41,264 --> 04:27:45,273
I pictured him with black,
slicked-back, greasy hair in a ponytail.

5726
04:27:45,273 --> 04:27:46,165
TALIESIN: I can see that, too.

5727
04:27:46,165 --> 04:27:48,285
ORION: What's your favorite part, Ashley?

5728
04:27:48,285 --> 04:27:51,358
ASHLEY: It's funny,
because when we first started,

5729
04:27:51,358 --> 04:27:54,471
and for the two years
that we've been doing it,

5730
04:27:54,471 --> 04:27:58,017
there was an element
that I liked about it,

5731
04:27:58,017 --> 04:28:00,885
that it was just ours,
and then when I would try to tell people,

5732
04:28:00,885 --> 04:28:04,413
I was like,
"ugh, they're not going to understand."

5733
04:28:04,413 --> 04:28:06,619
We get to go and play make-believe,

5734
04:28:06,619 --> 04:28:09,078
and nobody is judging anybody
and we can just go do it.

5735
04:28:09,078 --> 04:28:13,043
So I was hesitant
when we were starting the show,

5736
04:28:13,043 --> 04:28:15,660
but what's been awesome

5737
04:28:15,660 --> 04:28:18,579
is that you guys
have been so accepting

5738
04:28:18,579 --> 04:28:23,651
and such an amazing group
in the chat room.

5739
04:28:23,651 --> 04:28:28,604
And how you guys
have been supportive of us.

5740
04:28:28,604 --> 04:28:34,514
This has been one of my favorite things
that I've been a part of... in my life?

5741
04:28:34,514 --> 04:28:38,657
That's a really bold statement.

5742
04:28:38,657 --> 04:28:40,023
MATT: No, I feel the same way.

5743
04:28:40,023 --> 04:28:43,927
ASHLEY: I love it so much.
After two years,

5744
04:28:43,927 --> 04:28:46,348
obviously there's so much more
of an attachment to it,

5745
04:28:46,348 --> 04:28:50,643
but I just love it.
I love it so much.

5746
04:28:50,643 --> 04:28:53,926
TALIESIN: Everyone's so nice.
I barely believe it's the internet.

5747
04:28:53,926 --> 04:28:56,131
MATT: Oh, look at all the Ashley hearts.

5748
04:28:56,131 --> 04:28:59,153
TALIESIN: Aww.
ASHLEY: Hey, man.

5749
04:28:59,153 --> 04:28:59,941
ZAC: Somebody wanted to know

5750
04:28:59,941 --> 04:29:02,556
if any of you guys
had ever reached god mode status

5751
04:29:02,556 --> 04:29:04,522
in past D&amp;D campaigns.

5752
04:29:04,522 --> 04:29:05,329
MARISHA: No.
TALIESIN: Yes.

5753
04:29:05,329 --> 04:29:05,725
ZAC: Yes, you have?

5754
04:29:05,725 --> 04:29:06,370
TALIESIN: Yeah, I did.

5755
04:29:06,370 --> 04:29:10,262
But my DM was not very good,
so the game got so boring

5756
04:29:10,262 --> 04:29:14,319
we quit because our DM was weak.

5757
04:29:14,319 --> 04:29:17,577
MATT: Someone asked
about the PewDiePie thing.

5758
04:29:17,577 --> 04:29:19,918
What it was like DMing for him and Ken?

5759
04:29:19,918 --> 04:29:22,451
It was fun. They were great.
They were a lot of fun.

5760
04:29:22,451 --> 04:29:24,711
We only had half an hour to play,

5761
04:29:24,711 --> 04:29:27,534
both for me to teach them
and to play through a session,

5762
04:29:27,534 --> 04:29:29,056
so it was a very new challenge of,

5763
04:29:29,056 --> 04:29:31,398
"all right, let's do this!"
Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5764
04:29:31,398 --> 04:29:32,819
But it worked out pretty well.

5765
04:29:32,819 --> 04:29:34,174
We had a good time
and left on a cliffhanger,

5766
04:29:34,174 --> 04:29:36,069
and as long as they want
to keep bringing me back

5767
04:29:36,069 --> 04:29:37,941
to do it occasionally,
I'm happy to,

5768
04:29:37,941 --> 04:29:39,036
so let them know that you enjoyed it

5769
04:29:39,036 --> 04:29:41,700
and they should have me back,
because it was a good time.

5770
04:29:41,700 --> 04:29:45,116
ORION: I'm going to say
what my favorite part of D&amp;D is.

5771
04:29:45,116 --> 04:29:47,553
MARISHA: What's your favorite part
of D&amp;D, Orion?

5772
04:29:47,553 --> 04:29:55,592
ORION: Much like doing improv,
it's a wonderful escape.

5773
04:29:55,592 --> 04:30:03,644
I know I'm really frantic
in how I play it. Poor Matthew.

5774
04:30:03,644 --> 04:30:06,856
He puts up with arguments about spells
that I want to make super OP,

5775
04:30:06,856 --> 04:30:08,047
and he's like, "you can't do that."
I'm like, "but why?"

5776
04:30:08,047 --> 04:30:12,017
Those are our arguments.

5777
04:30:12,017 --> 04:30:15,293
MATT: Just keeping the balance.

5778
04:30:15,293 --> 04:30:19,247
ORION: When we got together
and we would play for 8 hours,

5779
04:30:19,247 --> 04:30:22,670
we would get together
and have lunch or dinner

5780
04:30:22,670 --> 04:30:27,228
and we would spend a lot of time,
and every game was a very special day,

5781
04:30:27,228 --> 04:30:32,668
so no matter
if the day was going great or not,

5782
04:30:32,668 --> 04:30:34,323
it didn't matter
because as soon as the game started,

5783
04:30:34,323 --> 04:30:37,978
it was a whole different world
that we had to step into,

5784
04:30:37,978 --> 04:30:40,293
and now we live in it and we breathe it.

5785
04:30:40,293 --> 04:30:43,256
It's great. We're all actors,

5786
04:30:43,256 --> 04:30:49,573
and to get lost in each other,
and with how Matthew narrates,

5787
04:30:49,573 --> 04:30:54,084
and you'll see it
when you watch the show,

5788
04:30:54,084 --> 04:31:00,571
I'm like, "oh," and there's cameras now,
and that's a whole other layer,

5789
04:31:00,571 --> 04:31:06,436
and I still get lost
in Keyleth shedding a tear,

5790
04:31:06,436 --> 04:31:12,060
and the way
Clarota interacts differently.

5791
04:31:12,060 --> 04:31:15,630
I don't see Matthew doing it.
I see (creature noise) that.

5792
04:31:15,630 --> 04:31:17,210
LAURA: Isn't that crazy

5793
04:31:17,210 --> 04:31:19,991
that it's instantly Clarota
and it's instantly Kima?

5794
04:31:19,991 --> 04:31:22,555
It's not Matt anymore,
as soon as it's that character.

5795
04:31:22,555 --> 04:31:24,654
ORION: So it is that sense
of realistic magic

5796
04:31:24,654 --> 04:31:27,233
that exists every single game.

5797
04:31:27,233 --> 04:31:29,235
MARISHA: It's weird, too,
because I almost feel like

5798
04:31:29,235 --> 04:31:33,566
bringing the game public
and for everybody else,

5799
04:31:33,566 --> 04:31:35,052
and the fact that we're doing it weekly,

5800
04:31:35,052 --> 04:31:39,608
it's almost bled the reality lines
even more,

5801
04:31:39,608 --> 04:31:44,635
because now they are like,
"oh, yeah, totally. Clarota.

5802
04:31:44,635 --> 04:31:46,887
"Yeah, we totally know
who you're talking about."

5803
04:31:46,887 --> 04:31:48,889
And so we're like,
"yeah, Clarota, right?"

5804
04:31:48,889 --> 04:31:53,386
You guys know Clarota.
And we're getting fan art.

5805
04:31:53,386 --> 04:31:55,845
TALIESIN: This is the speed
our personal text messages,

5806
04:31:55,845 --> 04:31:57,521
or group text messages, go at.

5807
04:31:57,521 --> 04:31:58,389
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah, it's true.

5808
04:31:58,389 --> 04:32:00,140
ASHLEY: Our group text message thread
is insane.

5809
04:32:00,140 --> 04:32:00,936
MARISHA: Yeah.

5810
04:32:00,936 --> 04:32:03,239
ASHLEY: The fan art
that you guys have been putting out

5811
04:32:03,239 --> 04:32:04,161
is so amazing.

5812
04:32:04,161 --> 04:32:07,187
LAURA: It makes us so happy.

5813
04:32:07,187 --> 04:32:10,781
ZAC: We're working on getting all of that
up on the website. We're working on it.

5814
04:32:10,781 --> 04:32:12,690
LAURA: Awesome.
MATT: That's going to be great.

5815
04:32:12,690 --> 04:32:16,046
LAURA: I save so many pictures
to my phone.

5816
04:32:16,046 --> 04:32:17,559
LIAM: I save it all.

5817
04:32:17,559 --> 04:32:18,940
LAURA: I have no reason for it,

5818
04:32:18,940 --> 04:32:21,270
but I scroll through it
when I'm by myself.

5819
04:32:21,270 --> 04:32:22,688
LIAM: I have a process.

5820
04:32:22,688 --> 04:32:25,282
It goes into my iPhone folder,
and then right into Dropbox.

5821
04:32:25,282 --> 04:32:26,497
TALIESIN: You find all the good stuff.

5822
04:32:26,497 --> 04:32:28,150
LAURA: Yeah, you find
a lot of good stuff.

5823
04:32:28,150 --> 04:32:30,917
Liam, man, you find so much
on the internet.

5824
04:32:30,917 --> 04:32:32,106
TALIESIN: He's the winner
for finding stuff.

5825
04:32:32,106 --> 04:32:33,717
LIAM: Pile of shit has a thousand eyes.

5826
04:32:33,717 --> 04:32:36,373
(all laugh)

5827
04:32:36,373 --> 04:32:38,462
TALIESIN: I love watching people
take risks.

5828
04:32:38,462 --> 04:32:41,438
That's my favorite thing about D&amp;D:
it's such a good place to take risks.

5829
04:32:41,438 --> 04:32:45,792
And the rewards that come with it
are so fantastic.

5830
04:32:45,792 --> 04:32:47,225
MATT: Two quick questions
I want to answer real fast,

5831
04:32:47,225 --> 04:32:48,964
when you're done.

5832
04:32:48,964 --> 04:32:50,114
TALIESIN: No, I'm done. Go ahead.

5833
04:32:50,114 --> 04:32:52,447
MATT: One: how did I
get into dungeon mastering?

5834
04:32:52,447 --> 04:32:55,355
By having
a really terrible dungeon master.

5835
04:32:55,355 --> 04:32:56,951
ORION: (laughs)
LIAM: Thanks to that guy!

5836
04:32:56,951 --> 04:33:00,054
MATT: Yeah.
Really nice guy in high school.

5837
04:33:00,054 --> 04:33:03,263
My first couple of games I ever played,
and he was just terrible,

5838
04:33:03,263 --> 04:33:05,611
and he had a player character
in the group

5839
04:33:05,611 --> 04:33:07,306
that was a paladin but also a samurai,

5840
04:33:07,306 --> 04:33:08,819
and he gave him
all the best magical equipment

5841
04:33:08,819 --> 04:33:11,535
and would fight party members.
It was awful.

5842
04:33:11,535 --> 04:33:13,081
I got frustrated,
so I bought the books myself

5843
04:33:13,081 --> 04:33:16,192
and learned to do it on my own.
I've been doing it ever since.

5844
04:33:16,192 --> 04:33:17,757
ORION: There you go.
What was the other thing?

5845
04:33:17,757 --> 04:33:18,692
MATT: What was that?

5846
04:33:18,692 --> 04:33:19,978
ORION: You said
there were two questions.

5847
04:33:19,978 --> 04:33:20,860
MATT: I forgot what the other one was.

5848
04:33:20,860 --> 04:33:22,100
ZAC: There's another one

5849
04:33:22,100 --> 04:33:22,900
that keeps getting asked
over and over again.

5850
04:33:22,900 --> 04:33:25,405
If you guys could be a different race,
what would you be?

5851
04:33:25,405 --> 04:33:26,248
LAURA: A different class?

5852
04:33:26,248 --> 04:33:27,172
ORION: I think I would want
to be Japanese

5853
04:33:27,172 --> 04:33:31,312
because it would be a whole different
cultural experience.

5854
04:33:31,312 --> 04:33:32,414
MARISHA: And they stay young forever.

5855
04:33:32,414 --> 04:33:34,599
ZAC: I thought that's what they meant.

5856
04:33:34,599 --> 04:33:37,068
LIAM: Ukraine, definitely.

5857
04:33:37,068 --> 04:33:38,347
TALIESIN: Dutch.

5858
04:33:38,347 --> 04:33:39,977
LIAM: I change my mind about that
every day.

5859
04:33:39,977 --> 04:33:43,643
I think about what to do
once he kills me off.

5860
04:33:43,643 --> 04:33:47,453
LAURA: Yeah. I think I definitely,
if I have to re-roll,

5861
04:33:47,453 --> 04:33:51,000
which I don't ever want to have to do,
but I would want to be a tiefling.

5862
04:33:51,000 --> 04:33:52,061
TALIESIN: Tieflings are cool.

5863
04:33:52,061 --> 04:33:55,433
I like being token human.
Token human has been a lot of fun.

5864
04:33:55,433 --> 04:33:58,370
LAURA: I know! I also like being a human.
MATT: Humans are pretty awesome.

5865
04:33:58,370 --> 04:34:00,821
ORION: Dragonborn for life.
MATT: (laughs) Forever.

5866
04:34:00,821 --> 04:34:02,251
TALIESIN: My previous character
was dragonborn.

5867
04:34:02,251 --> 04:34:03,541
LIAM: I don't want to say,

5868
04:34:03,541 --> 04:34:05,608
because I'm convinced
Matt will kill me eventually,

5869
04:34:05,608 --> 04:34:07,807
and I don't want to spoil
whatever I cook up.

5870
04:34:07,807 --> 04:34:09,317
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Oh, that's true.

5871
04:34:09,317 --> 04:34:12,124
MARISHA: I might have to bring in a dwarf.
It might be time.

5872
04:34:12,124 --> 04:34:13,452
MATT: If I could play a character,
it would be a dwarf.

5873
04:34:13,452 --> 04:34:15,376
Probably a dwarf bard.
I love dwarves so much.

5874
04:34:15,376 --> 04:34:16,279
LAURA: You're so good at dwarves.

5875
04:34:16,279 --> 04:34:18,594
LIAM: Can we hear
your dwarf accent again?

5876
04:34:18,594 --> 04:34:19,148
MARISHA: Well...

5877
04:34:19,148 --> 04:34:22,041
MATT: Marisha,
want to give us an example?

5878
04:34:22,041 --> 04:34:23,654
MARISHA: (Swedish accent)
Oh, you mean this dwarf?

5879
04:34:23,654 --> 04:34:24,549
ORION AND MATT: (crack up)

5880
04:34:24,549 --> 04:34:26,157
MARISHA: (same accent) 
This dwarf accent?

5881
04:34:26,157 --> 04:34:28,027
(all laugh)

5882
04:34:28,027 --> 04:34:29,780
ASHLEY: It's a Swedish dwarf!

5883
04:34:29,780 --> 04:34:31,304
LIAM: (similar accent) 
Welcome to IKEA.

5884
04:34:31,304 --> 04:34:32,774
TRAVIS: Wow.
TALIESIN: That was a dwarf chef.

5885
04:34:32,774 --> 04:34:35,916
MARISHA: (same accent) Hello!
Hello, welcome to Kraghammer.

5886
04:34:35,916 --> 04:34:38,527
TALIESIN: (imitates the Swedish Chef)

5887
04:34:38,527 --> 04:34:41,579
MARISHA: (same accent) Where's the d20?

5888
04:34:41,579 --> 04:34:43,559
ORION: (Scottish accent)
She's the special dwarf.

5889
04:34:43,559 --> 04:34:45,902
ZAC: I have a good question
to end out on.

5890
04:34:45,902 --> 04:34:47,989
I also like
what somebody in the chat room said

5891
04:34:47,989 --> 04:34:51,310
that for Critical Role fans,
you could call them Critters.

5892
04:34:51,310 --> 04:34:53,721
MARISHA: (gasps) Critters!

5893
04:34:53,721 --> 04:34:55,890
LIAM: I said that months ago.

5894
04:34:55,890 --> 04:34:57,014
LAURA: I love it!
TALIESIN: (cheers)

5895
04:34:57,014 --> 04:34:58,721
ASHLEY: Oh, Critters, I love you!

5896
04:34:58,721 --> 04:35:02,029
MATT: Oh, that's awesome.
Thank you, Liam. Thank you, chat.

5897
04:35:02,029 --> 04:35:05,675
ZAC: So you guys have officially
dubbed yourselves Critters,

5898
04:35:05,675 --> 04:35:07,819
and by yourselves, I mean by Liam.

5899
04:35:07,819 --> 04:35:09,650
(all laugh)

5900
04:35:09,650 --> 04:35:12,785
ZAC: The question I think
would be good to end out on is,

5901
04:35:12,785 --> 04:35:17,836
"what would each of you recommend to them
to tell their friends

5902
04:35:17,836 --> 04:35:18,986
to get them into D&amp;D?"

5903
04:35:18,986 --> 04:35:24,097
How would you recommend other people
push D&amp;D onto people?

5904
04:35:24,097 --> 04:35:26,082
LIAM: Live a video game
while drinking with your friends.

5905
04:35:26,082 --> 04:35:27,525
LAURA AND ASHLEY: Yeah.

5906
04:35:27,525 --> 04:35:30,125
LAURA: Or hanging with your friends.
You don't have to drink.

5907
04:35:30,125 --> 04:35:33,034
ASHLEY: Yeah, but I feel that also

5908
04:35:33,034 --> 04:35:37,273
the DM makes all the difference
in the world. Find a good DM.

5909
04:35:37,273 --> 04:35:40,341
Which, there isn't anyone
as good as Matt.

5910
04:35:40,341 --> 04:35:42,348
MATT: Or be one. That's not true.
MARISHA: Step up.

5911
04:35:42,348 --> 04:35:51,499
MATT: It's communal storytelling.
You forge memories with friends.

5912
04:35:51,499 --> 04:35:55,852
It's a really cool improvised story
that you all create together.

5913
04:35:55,852 --> 04:35:59,944
LIAM: And playing with someone
who's not a crazy talented voice actor

5914
04:35:59,944 --> 04:36:04,352
is still better than not playing,
so find a DM and start a game.

5915
04:36:04,352 --> 04:36:05,660
Start your first game.

5916
04:36:05,660 --> 04:36:15,845
ORION: I tell people it's not about math,
it's not about paper and pencil.

5917
04:36:15,845 --> 04:36:18,786
When you were a kid
and you went outside and played all day

5918
04:36:18,786 --> 04:36:20,769
and you were just a kid?
That's what this is.

5919
04:36:20,769 --> 04:36:24,994
It's just remembering
how to do that again with friends.

5920
04:36:24,994 --> 04:36:26,655
ZAC: That's what you fucking tell people.

5921
04:36:26,655 --> 04:36:27,683
MARISHA: It's pretend as adults.

5922
04:36:27,683 --> 04:36:30,135
TALIESIN: It's a game that you can play
with your friends

5923
04:36:30,135 --> 04:36:34,547
that will create the kinds of bonded,
shared experiences

5924
04:36:34,547 --> 04:36:37,024
that created the friends
you had in high school.

5925
04:36:37,024 --> 04:36:41,009
The friends you just don't get anymore.
But you can get them by doing this.

5926
04:36:41,009 --> 04:36:43,343
This is to make
that high school friend again.

5927
04:36:43,343 --> 04:36:45,264
MARISHA: Totally. If you can find
a group of friends

5928
04:36:45,264 --> 04:36:49,110
that you can openly play D&amp;D with,
without them judging you.

5929
04:36:49,110 --> 04:36:51,574
LAURA: And even if
it's not people you know very well.

5930
04:36:51,574 --> 04:36:56,791
If you find people that like D&amp;D--
so many people that we've seen online,

5931
04:36:56,791 --> 04:36:59,361
and some of our friends,
don't have D&amp;D groups,

5932
04:36:59,361 --> 04:37:03,272
and they find a place
to go and play D&amp;D and meet those people.

5933
04:37:03,272 --> 04:37:05,944
Honestly, I didn't know you very well,
I didn't know Orion very well,

5934
04:37:05,944 --> 04:37:10,387
when we started,
and now all of us are best friends.

5935
04:37:10,387 --> 04:37:12,293
LIAM: Now we're thick as thieves.
LAURA: It creates that.

5936
04:37:12,293 --> 04:37:15,555
TALIESIN: This is a group of people
I see more often than any other group.

5937
04:37:15,555 --> 04:37:17,956
LAURA: I know, we see each other more
than almost anybody else in our lives.

5938
04:37:17,956 --> 04:37:19,827
ZAC: I like the hashtag #BondageFriends.

5939
04:37:19,827 --> 04:37:20,938
MATT: (laughs)
LAURA AND MARISHA: Bondage friends.

5940
04:37:20,938 --> 04:37:21,751
ORION: Well, hold on.

5941
04:37:21,751 --> 04:37:22,685
TALIESIN: That's a whole other
group of friends.

5942
04:37:22,685 --> 04:37:25,261
ORION: I don't love that hashtag.

5943
04:37:25,261 --> 04:37:27,280
TALIESIN: I see them
about once a month, really.

5944
04:37:27,280 --> 04:37:30,832
LAURA: We've got to get going.
Grog has a session in the morning.

5945
04:37:30,832 --> 04:37:31,951
ZAC: Yeah, so I think that's good.

5946
04:37:31,951 --> 04:37:33,241
TALIESIN: It's funny because--
MATT AND TALIESIN: It's true.

5947
04:37:33,241 --> 04:37:34,347
ZAC: I think that's a good time
to close it out.

5948
04:37:34,347 --> 04:37:38,254
Thank you, everyone, for getting us
to that thousand shirts sold.

5949
04:37:38,254 --> 04:37:41,007
MATT: You guys were amazing.
Thank you so much.

5950
04:37:41,007 --> 04:37:42,148
ZAC: Every month, we're going to have

5951
04:37:42,148 --> 04:37:44,832
a new special limited-edition
Critical Role shirt

5952
04:37:44,832 --> 04:37:46,212
going up on Teespring,

5953
04:37:46,212 --> 04:37:49,823
but we're also
launching a merch store in June

5954
04:37:49,823 --> 04:37:52,144
that will have lots
of different Critical Role shirts,

5955
04:37:52,144 --> 04:37:53,142
so you'll have
many options to choose from,

5956
04:37:53,142 --> 04:37:55,489
and those will be shirts
that live on forever,

5957
04:37:55,489 --> 04:37:59,279
but the shirts that we sell on Teespring
will be limited edition.

5958
04:37:59,279 --> 04:38:03,006
You'll only be able to have them
within two weeks.

5959
04:38:03,006 --> 04:38:04,167
ORION: I have a weird thing, too.

5960
04:38:04,167 --> 04:38:07,378
I'm doing a thing
where if you have a PS4

5961
04:38:07,378 --> 04:38:09,643
and you follow me on Twitter,
@orionacaba,

5962
04:38:09,643 --> 04:38:12,065
every 20 followers,
I'm going to randomly pick one person.

5963
04:38:12,065 --> 04:38:15,535
I'll tweet at you,
and then tweet me your PS4 handle,

5964
04:38:15,535 --> 04:38:17,715
and I'll add you to my friends list
and we can play together.

5965
04:38:17,715 --> 04:38:19,589
MATT: There you go.
ORION: So yeah, hit me up.

5966
04:38:19,589 --> 04:38:22,028
MATT: Guys, thank you all so much.

5967
04:38:22,028 --> 04:38:24,434
Sincerely, for watching,
for being amazing,

5968
04:38:24,434 --> 04:38:29,583
and for tuning in
to enjoy our silliness.

5969
04:38:29,583 --> 04:38:31,711
LAURA: We love you, Critters!

5970
04:38:31,711 --> 04:38:33,943
MARISHA: See you next week!
