1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,347
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to
Critical Role this week, where us crazy voice

2
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:10,725
actors play a nerdy game of Dungeons and Dragons!
I'm so glad you guys could join us. We had a small

3
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:16,597
hiatus last week as me and Marisha were away at a
cool event in the desert, but we're back. I want

4
00:00:16,597 --> 00:00:21,466
to give a big thanks and shout-out to Ivan for
running that one-shot game last week. Ivan, you

5
00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:26,489
kicked ass, you were awesome, and thank you for
carrying the torch when we couldn't be here.

6
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:31,570
Really appreciate that. And for those who tuned in
for him and supporting: thank you guys. Quick

7
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,041
little shout-out. We had actually one of our
fellow Critters come find us out in the desert

8
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:39,949
this past week. So a shout-out to our friend Scott
from Boise, Idaho. Operator, thank you so much for

9
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:43,316
coming and visiting. It was awesome getting to
chat with you, and it was cool.

10
00:00:43,316 --> 00:00:44,848
MARISHA: Yeah, that was a surrealist experience.

11
00:00:44,848 --> 00:00:48,237
MATT: Yeah, we had some cool Critical Role
representation out on the Playas. That was really

12
00:00:48,237 --> 00:00:53,386
neat. Thank you so much. It was awesome to meet
you, Scott, and thanks for coming by. Other fun

13
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:59,046
announcements... This is a cool thing that came
up, actually. Hasbro's working with Indiegogo

14
00:00:59,046 --> 00:01:05,203
right now to do essentially the search for their
new face-to-face party game circumstance. So

15
00:01:05,203 --> 00:01:11,027
they're accepting a bunch of submissions right
now. I think it's nextgreatgamechallenge.com, but

16
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:15,045
if you're like me and spent a lot of your youth
spending your summers designing your own card

17
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:18,468
games and your own board games and your own party
games and such that just sat there and did

18
00:01:18,468 --> 00:01:23,221
nothing, now is actually a really cool opportunity
to submit those and possibly get them published.

19
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:29,477
Because the person who wins, wins $10,000 on top
of the fact that they get flown out to Hasbro, to

20
00:01:29,477 --> 00:01:34,277
the actual company building to work on developing
the game with their development team. So that's

21
00:01:34,277 --> 00:01:38,830
pretty cool. (laughs) So those of you who have
that little game design brain, go ahead and throw

22
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:43,671
your ideas out that way. Submit to this! Hopefully
you could win. The thing goes to September 30th?

23
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:48,914
You don't have a whole lot of time, so get on it.
But check it out! A possible opportunity for you

24
00:01:48,914 --> 00:01:54,988
to design your own game. Who knows, maybe one day
we'll be playing it on this Twitch stream. So

25
00:01:54,988 --> 00:01:56,216
check that out.

26
00:01:56,216 --> 00:02:02,505
Also, Welovefine is running a t-shirt design
contest for the upcoming Rage of Dragons Dungeons

27
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:09,510
and Dragons release, and they've asked me to be
one of the judges of that contest. So all you

28
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:13,797
people with an artistic bone in your body, go
ahead and design some t-shirts. Go to

29
00:02:13,797 --> 00:02:19,669
welovefine.com, check out the contest rules for
the Rage of Demons contest. But I'll be judging

30
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:24,530
your designs! And hopefully if yours is
appreciated by me and all the other judges, you'll

31
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,066
be getting a cash prize and have your shirts
officially sanctioned by D&amp;D and put on

32
00:02:28,123 --> 00:02:33,567
welovefine.com, so check that out! That's a cool
thing! I've already seen some great art. Some

33
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:36,540
people have floated over to Twitter. If I haven't
responded, it's because I'm a judge and I probably

34
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,538
shouldn't. (laughs) But everything looks cool, so
thank you guys for your submissions.

35
00:02:40,538 --> 00:02:43,025
TRAVIS: Do you accept cash bribes?

36
00:02:43,025 --> 00:02:54,072
MATT: (laughs) No. Other cool announcements. Oh!
Once again, every week we have our hundred sub

37
00:02:54,198 --> 00:02:58,321
giveaway. Every hundred subs we get, we have a
giveaway with somebody randomly within the chat

38
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:04,343
who is actively in the chat. This involves a
picture of the cast, signed, one of our posters

39
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:11,596
from our fantastic official artist Kit Buss,
signed, and for a few short giveaways, we'll also

40
00:03:11,596 --> 00:03:15,477
be giving away a copy of this Pen to Paper
Imaginary Friend book that we received, gifted to

41
00:03:15,477 --> 00:03:20,760
us by 826LA. It's a book of a collection of
stories from the kids that have been tutored at

42
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,748
826LA that told stories about their imaginary
friends and what they were like, and their

43
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:31,051
adventures. And they had a lot of talented artists
and animators come in and actually illustrate what

44
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:37,404
these imaginary friends look like and what their
experiences are with those imaginary friends. So

45
00:03:37,404 --> 00:03:41,039
we'll be giving one of these away with each one of
those hundred sub giveaways to you guys who have

46
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,041
been so gracious in helping support 826LA.

47
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,122
MARISHA: Yes. And we went today!

48
00:03:45,122 --> 00:03:52,661
MATT: We went today to 826LA to deliver a nice,
big, fatty check to them from you guys, and they

49
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:56,263
were blown away by it. We got to teach a bunch of
young kids the basics of Dungeons and Dragons, and

50
00:03:56,263 --> 00:04:00,525
we gave them copies of the books to hopefully
start a few games of their own there,

51
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:01,733
so thank you.

52
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:06,611
MARISHA: This was such a great experience, and we
took video of it, so hopefully we'll have that

53
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:12,028
edited and maybe sometime next week or the week
after, you guys can see and learn a little bit

54
00:04:12,028 --> 00:04:14,540
about this charity that we support and talk about
every week.

55
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,935
MATT: Yep, we'll have a cool video up. It'll show
you guys our whole experience at 826LA delivering

56
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:24,883
and talking to them about everything, so that'll
be fun! Other announcements: This is one of the

57
00:04:24,883 --> 00:04:28,494
gifts that we're actually talking about at the
start of the stream because we want to utilize it

58
00:04:28,494 --> 00:04:35,843
through it. A fantastic gentleman by the name of
Jim Donnis sent us custom Vox Machina etched

59
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:46,151
glasses. Customized character glass icons. I have
my Dungeon Master glass here. So that's really

60
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:50,821
awesome. And also sent us some really, really
nice, quality, expensive dranky-drank.

61
00:04:50,821 --> 00:04:52,398
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's legit.

62
00:04:52,398 --> 00:04:58,296
MATT: It's legit. Jim, that's ridiculous. And
amazing. And thank you! We shall progressively

63
00:04:58,296 --> 00:05:01,840
enjoy it through the stream tonight. So here's to
you, Jim. Thank you very much.

64
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,056
MARISHA and TALIESIN: To Jim!

65
00:05:03,056 --> 00:05:04,789
TRAVIS: (slurred) To Jim!

66
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:16,185
MATT: That's tasty. Also, announcements from us!
Any project or game announcements? I know this

67
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:19,768
recently sparks the release of the Mad Max game
that just came out.

68
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:21,434
MARISHA: Where's Orion?

69
00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:23,548
MATT: Orion will be here in a second. He's missing
his moment.

70
00:05:23,548 --> 00:05:25,536
LAURA: But Travis plays the lead villain!

71
00:05:25,536 --> 00:05:27,318
MATT: Travis is the main villain! Scrotus!

72
00:05:27,318 --> 00:05:31,951
TRAVIS: Yes, Scabrous Scrotus. Who is in no way
related to Grog.

73
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:36,944
MATT: No. He is large and has many curious
accoutrements on his outfit.

74
00:05:36,944 --> 00:05:40,025
TRAVIS: Yes he does! He has a giant horn on his
crotch. Don't know what that's about.

75
00:05:40,025 --> 00:05:41,718
ORION: Are we talking about Mad Max?

76
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:42,653
MATT: Yes, we are.

77
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:43,700
ORION: Hey, he's Scrotus!

78
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,548
MATT: Yes! And you are?

79
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:57,425
ORION: I play Scab and a bunch of war boys. So
check it out! Because I work with this guy here!

80
00:05:57,425 --> 00:06:03,275
MATT: And I'm a war boy commander and a bunch of
other guys, so you hear a lot of me going,

81
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:07,583
"Get that guy!" And a lot of random NPCs giving
quests.

82
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,402
LAURA: Yeah, I think you hear me barfing a lot
during that game.

83
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:12,897
MATT: Oh, man. That was a lot of dry heaving for
like twenty minutes.

84
00:06:12,897 --> 00:06:14,454
LAURA: Yeah! Crazy.

85
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:20,256
MARISHA: Always makes me actually want to barf. It
makes my eyes water and be like, ugh.

86
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:27,248
MATT: You know you've achieved it properly when
the director goes, "Okay, no, we got it. Ugh." So

87
00:06:27,248 --> 00:06:32,542
yeah, Chris put us through the paces on our
varying array of vomiting techniques on that

88
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:38,364
project. So enjoy that in Mad Max! Also, same
time, just came out Metal Gear Solid V: The

89
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:43,422
Phantom Pain, for those of you who worked on that
one. I know Marisha, if you want to talk about

90
00:06:43,422 --> 00:06:44,757
your involvement in that?

91
00:06:44,757 --> 00:06:46,017
MARISHA: Yes, oh-- Sam!

92
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:47,870
MATT: We have a Sam! Sam's arrived! Yay!

93
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:55,935
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm one of the Diamond Dog soldiers
that you can eventually recruit and play as, and

94
00:06:55,935 --> 00:07:02,964
so you can either shoot at me a lot and kill me a
lot, or you can run around as me. And apparently

95
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:07,065
once you get me I've got better stats than Big
Boss, which is pretty fucking dope.

96
00:07:07,065 --> 00:07:12,661
MATT: Damn right, you do. I also voice a lot of
the male Diamond Dog soldiers and enemy soldiers

97
00:07:12,661 --> 00:07:16,015
throughout the game, so you'll be shooting and
capturing and recruiting a lot of me and Marisha

98
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:22,860
throughout the game. Yeah, so check that out. Any
other announcements?

99
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:29,503
ORION: Yes! Speaking of Mad Max again, because
it's super cool, I've actually partnered with

100
00:07:29,503 --> 00:07:35,139
Twitch as of ten days ago, so I'm doing my Twitch
and I've been playing the shit out of Mad Max, so

101
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:39,080
follow me on there! Orionacaba at Twitch, and
check that shit out.

102
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,788
MARISHA: You should play some Metal Gear.

103
00:07:40,788 --> 00:07:41,721
ORION: Nope!

104
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:44,120
TRAVIS: Not until you beat Mad Max.

105
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,544
LAURA: You should play some Borderlands.

106
00:07:45,544 --> 00:07:50,355
ORION: I'll go to your place and watch you play it
because I want to watch you play your character.

107
00:07:50,355 --> 00:07:54,412
MATT: Why don't you come to our place to watch
Laura play Borderlands? We'll chain this.

108
00:07:54,412 --> 00:07:59,150
MARISHA: Guys, why don't we just LAN party and
only play as characters we voice?

109
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,120
MATT: That's not masturbatory at all.

110
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,645
TRAVIS: No. Not at all.

111
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:04,111
ORION: Yeah, that's weird.

112
00:08:04,111 --> 00:08:05,419
TALIESIN: We can make a little ring.

113
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:06,665
MARISHA: Yes! Of narcissism!

114
00:08:06,665 --> 00:08:07,760
MATT: Exactly.

115
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,449
ORION: Ew, that's gross.

116
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:11,964
MATT: Cool! Do we have any other announcements?

117
00:08:11,964 --> 00:08:19,269
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, it's the start of the 2015 NFL
football season. I'll be repping the Dallas

118
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:24,502
Cowboys today. They're not playing right now, but
they will be on Sunday. Go Cowboys.

119
00:08:24,502 --> 00:08:27,801
MATT: Awesome. For the four of you that are
interested in football watching the stream--

120
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:30,346
TRAVIS: We all come from different walks, all
right?

121
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:34,615
MATT: I know. No, that's awesome. Cool! There we
go.

122
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,238
TALIESIN: Teach me of your ways.

123
00:08:36,238 --> 00:08:38,165
TRAVIS: (laughs) My sorcerer's ways.

124
00:08:38,165 --> 00:08:41,887
MATT: (laughs) I was too much of an indoor kid.
But I'm learning!

125
00:08:41,887 --> 00:08:43,450
TRAVIS: There goes ball. Chase ball.

126
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,173
LAURA: We're growing! We're learning and growing.

127
00:08:45,173 --> 00:08:48,793
MATT: I am. I got really into rugby when we were
in New Zealand. Oh, sports I can watch!

128
00:08:48,793 --> 00:08:51,386
MARISHA: Rugby's dope, man. They're hardcore.

129
00:08:51,386 --> 00:08:56,155
MATT: Yeah, they hit each other really hard. They
call things a scrum. That sounds like fun.

130
00:08:56,155 --> 00:08:57,559
TRAVIS: Yeah. That's rugby. Scrum.

131
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,406
MATT: That's intense, man.

132
00:08:58,406 --> 00:08:59,549
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's some brutal stuff.

133
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:05,260
MATT: Yeah. So we will have a Liam possibly
joining us later in the evening. He had some

134
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,902
family commitments tonight, but he's going to hope
to try and join us around 8:30 or 9:00,

135
00:09:07,902 --> 00:09:08,820
if at all.

136
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,793
LAURA: A wild Scanlan coming next to me.

137
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:14,236
MATT: Oh no! We got Scanlan jumping ship now!

138
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:16,046
SAM: I've never been over here before.

139
00:09:16,046 --> 00:09:20,057
ORION: How does it feel on that side? When I
played with Will Friedle--

140
00:09:20,057 --> 00:09:21,799
LAURA: Yeah, I was on that side.

141
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:26,132
MARISHA: Yeah, we were switched. That's right.
It's weird. It does feel weird.

142
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,665
SAM: Everything flushes the other way around.

143
00:09:28,665 --> 00:09:30,758
MATT: That's how it works in this place, yeah.

144
00:09:30,758 --> 00:09:33,201
MARISHA: Is it colder over there? Are you guys in
winter?

145
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:35,560
SAM: Wow, that's so weird!

146
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,763
MARISHA: I know, it's awesome.

147
00:09:36,763 --> 00:09:46,751
MATT: Well, anything else? Are we good on
announcements? Perfect! All right. Well then,

148
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:51,430
let's go ahead and roll that intro and return.
We'll jump right into the game and kick up this

149
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,118
next session of Critical Role! See you in just a
minute.

150
00:09:54,118 --> 00:11:01,297
[dramatic music]

151
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:05,444
MATT: Welcome back. Quick announcement that I
forgot: There is a Kickstarter up for the third

152
00:11:05,444 --> 00:11:09,681
Mythica film, which if you guys haven't watched
it, it's a really awesome indie-budget fantasy

153
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:17,722
series, and a bunch of good friends are in it. I
play the main villain, necromancer Zorlock, who

154
00:11:17,722 --> 00:11:20,875
showed up a little bit in the second film, and the
third one is now going into post, and that's what

155
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,434
the Kickstarter's asking for your help.

156
00:11:22,434 --> 00:11:23,600
[no audio]

157
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,614
MATT: If it's something you want to donate to,
it's a cool project, you get to watch me be all

158
00:11:25,614 --> 00:11:26,866
evil and cast--

159
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:29,248
TRAVIS: I watched it. It's really fun.

160
00:11:29,248 --> 00:11:33,715
MATT: (laughs) You can see me cast necromantic
spells at Kevin Sorbo. I mean, what more could you

161
00:11:33,715 --> 00:11:34,642
want, really?

162
00:11:34,642 --> 00:11:35,572
LAURA: Nothing.

163
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:37,024
MATT: Our hair has a battle. It's wonderful.

164
00:11:37,024 --> 00:11:39,152
ORION: Our mighty DM versus Hercules.

165
00:11:39,152 --> 00:11:42,964
MATT: Indeed. I remember the first time we met on
set, he came up to me, and goes like, "What's your

166
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:54,517
"mother's name?" I still wonder. But anyway. Let us
bring us back to the story. Now, Vox Machina,

167
00:11:54,517 --> 00:12:02,890
after completing the trials of the Slayer's Take
and acquiring their marking brand as essence of

168
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:08,606
them joining the actual guild itself, meeting the
gynosphinx that is currently responsible--

169
00:12:08,606 --> 00:12:09,914
LAURA: (chuckles)

170
00:12:09,914 --> 00:12:16,792
MATT: Such children. Responsible for the
development and the progression of the guild

171
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:26,574
itself, they found themselves having Pike join
them for about a week's time while the landscape

172
00:12:26,574 --> 00:12:32,531
of her temple to Sarenrae was being cleansed of a
curse, and the group decided to follow through on

173
00:12:32,531 --> 00:12:38,967
their promise to aid Keyleth on her Aramente to
find the Pyrah people to the far southwest of

174
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:39,949
Vasselheim.

175
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:42,212
LAURA: Ugh!

176
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:43,654
TRAVIS: I'm burping garlic.

177
00:12:43,654 --> 00:12:50,704
MATT: Ugh. Garlic. Stinking Cloud over there. You
thought he wasn't a caster. They made their way to

178
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:59,417
the mountains, eventually to the actual Pyrah
tribe itself, where they underwent a trial through

179
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:05,512
the elemental plane of fire. Battled some of the
druids, the Pyrah themselves, in elemental fire

180
00:13:05,512 --> 00:13:11,887
form, combated against time through a cinder storm
as they attempted to escape, and managed to do so

181
00:13:11,887 --> 00:13:17,236
with their lives, and in doing so gained the
blessing of the Aramente for Keyleth from the

182
00:13:17,236 --> 00:13:25,156
Pyrah tribe, as well as a blessing from the main
druid as well, as a spark stone. And

183
00:13:25,156 --> 00:13:30,572
returned to Vasselheim, Pike then said her
goodbyes again, returning to help the restoration

184
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:37,610
of the temple of Sarenrae, and you've all been
left to your devices now. So. As you all awaken

185
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:43,953
the next morning within the guildhall itself, your
journey and your path is your own to take.

186
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:46,976
TRAVIS: We wake the next morning. Beard check,
please.

187
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:50,076
MATT: Beard check. (laughs)

188
00:13:50,076 --> 00:13:51,444
TRAVIS: Zero. Or ten?

189
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:52,511
LAURA: That's zero.

190
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,601
SAM: That's good.

191
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:55,199
MARISHA: It depends.

192
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,900
TRAVIS: That's a hundred.

193
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,867
MARISHA: Are you serious?

194
00:13:57,867 --> 00:13:59,327
TRAVIS: That's the second time that's happened.

195
00:13:59,327 --> 00:14:03,987
MARISHA: All you had to have rolled was a nine or
anything other than a zero. That's all you had

196
00:14:03,987 --> 00:14:05,166
to-- anything.

197
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:10,430
MATT: If this had been the second edition
Encyclopedia Magica, you would've gotten the most

198
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:18,221
broken artifact ever. You rolled two hundreds.
With a tiny methodical squeak, your pores produce

199
00:14:18,221 --> 00:14:24,663
but a few random molecules of hair-like material
that then puff in the air around you.

200
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:29,253
TRAVIS: Is it at least rough? Like, you know, he
needs to shave, it's so rough.

201
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:31,151
LAURA: Nah, it's smooth as a baby's bottom.

202
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:32,865
TALIESIN: Well-oiled.

203
00:14:32,865 --> 00:14:37,570
LAURA: Fine leather. That's what your face feels
like.

204
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:43,354
ORION: It's still 24 hours since we had the feast,
right? It still counts as the same time?

205
00:14:43,354 --> 00:14:48,446
MATT: The travel back to the town took about two
and a half, three days, so that's been long past

206
00:14:48,446 --> 00:14:53,013
the feast. So the benefits of the Heroes' Feast
have already been washed from your system.

207
00:14:53,013 --> 00:14:55,614
SAM: Where am I?

208
00:14:55,614 --> 00:15:05,133
MATT: Where are you? That's a very good question.
As you returned, tired from the venture, went to

209
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:08,751
sleep. You have spent the past week or so--

210
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:10,190
SAM: On my own.

211
00:15:10,323 --> 00:15:16,573
MATT: On your own, essentially finding one of the
various establishments in the city that can aid

212
00:15:16,628 --> 00:15:22,910
you through your sore muscles through the help of
feminine companionship-- or other types of

213
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:27,525
companionship; whatever your preference may be.
But upon leaving, realize that your party had left

214
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:29,508
and been gone for some time.

215
00:15:29,508 --> 00:15:33,404
SAM: Where are they? Where am I?

216
00:15:33,404 --> 00:15:37,569
MATT: You've just now found word they've returned
to the Slayer's Take guildhall, and you've made

217
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,743
your way in that direction this bright morning.

218
00:15:39,743 --> 00:15:41,195
TRAVIS: Because it's free to stay there.

219
00:15:41,195 --> 00:15:42,465
LAURA: Yeah, we can stay there for free.

220
00:15:42,465 --> 00:15:43,486
SAM: Hello!

221
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:44,965
LAURA and MARISHA: Scanlan!

222
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:46,918
SAM: Where have you guys been?

223
00:15:46,918 --> 00:15:49,214
LAURA: Oh, Scanlan. You've just missed Pike!

224
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:54,354
SAM: What?! Pike? Pike was here?

225
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:58,390
MARISHA: We took a field trip with her.

226
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,870
SAM: What are you talking about? Why didn't you
call me? We have an earring!

227
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:08,800
ORION: I used it twice, and you said, stop
bothering me, Tiberius.

228
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,152
SAM: Well, I-- (sighs)

229
00:16:10,152 --> 00:16:15,466
TALIESIN: We were hearing very weird things from
the other end of that ear piece

230
00:16:15,466 --> 00:16:18,316
ORION: Though he definitely said my name and told
me to stop.

231
00:16:18,316 --> 00:16:22,621
SAM: You didn't lead with Pike, though! You should
have said, Pike's here. Hey, Pike's here.

232
00:16:22,621 --> 00:16:24,032
LAURA: You probably should have done that.

233
00:16:24,032 --> 00:16:25,129
ORION: My bad.

234
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:27,122
SAM: (frustrated noise)

235
00:16:27,122 --> 00:16:28,202
ORION: Sorry about that.

236
00:16:28,202 --> 00:16:32,238
SAM: I mean, I was having a fun time, but I
would've dropped everything to be with Pike.

237
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:35,167
ORION: Well, a Stormwind likes to finish a
sentence, and I apparently need to start a

238
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:37,756
sentence correctly for you to hold your attention
long enough.

239
00:16:37,756 --> 00:16:41,192
SAM: Don't bury the lede. Pike first. Always Pike
first.

240
00:16:41,192 --> 00:16:42,241
ORION: Right. Sorry.

241
00:16:42,241 --> 00:16:43,902
SAM: I wasn't even in a brothel.

242
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,444
LAURA: Oh, you weren't?

243
00:16:45,444 --> 00:16:49,766
SAM: I walked toward the brothel, but then I
bumped into Zahra. Remember Zahra?

244
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:50,946
TALIESIN: Oh, Zahra!

245
00:16:50,946 --> 00:16:56,321
SAM: She invited me over. We talked all night. One
thing led to another-- nothing untoward-- but we

246
00:16:56,321 --> 00:17:02,288
just had a nice slumber party. It was lovely. It
was me and a couple of tieflings. Three, I think.

247
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:07,950
We were doing each other's hair, telling stories,
playing songs. It was wonderful!

248
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,135
TRAVIS: Can I roll to see if he's bullshitting?

249
00:17:10,135 --> 00:17:12,898
MATT: You can go ahead and make a-- this would be
an insight.

250
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:16,559
TRAVIS: Yeah! Grog insight check! Modifier is
zero! That's a nine.

251
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,314
(laughter)

252
00:17:18,314 --> 00:17:25,161
MATT: You are enthralled by his tale. Your elbows
are on the edge of the bedspread right now with

253
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:26,858
your hands clasped--

254
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:28,100
TRAVIS: Are my feet behind me, crisscrossing?

255
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,959
MATT: You are this close to a breakdown from
Grease. It's pretty fantastic.

256
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:34,477
TRAVIS: (singing) Tell me more, tell me more...

257
00:17:34,477 --> 00:17:39,181
SAM: It was great. We had a great PG night.

258
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:43,567
MARISHA: Sounds like exactly what you needed.

259
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:46,073
LAURA: Well, then. That sounds like a wonderful
time. It's all right that you missed Pike.

260
00:17:46,073 --> 00:17:49,713
SAM: Yeah, except I would have dropped everything
to come to see the woman I love, the woman of my

261
00:17:49,713 --> 00:17:56,374
dreams, the woman I will marry and bear children
with. I don't know if she'll bear mine or I'll

262
00:17:56,374 --> 00:17:57,582
bear hers.

263
00:17:57,582 --> 00:17:59,571
ORION: Yes. How does it work with gnomes?

264
00:17:59,571 --> 00:18:01,017
SAM: Gnomes, it's tricky.

265
00:18:01,017 --> 00:18:03,504
ORION: Yes, I've never seen a gnome birth,
before.

266
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:05,046
SAM: You never know.

267
00:18:05,046 --> 00:18:06,771
TALIESIN: Would it help if there were trolls?

268
00:18:06,771 --> 00:18:08,882
SAM: Oh, don't get me started.

269
00:18:08,882 --> 00:18:12,405
TALIESIN: All right, so if there were trolls, it
would be better that you missed everything. There

270
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:15,181
weren't trolls, but if there had been, it would
have been better.

271
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:16,976
SAM: Well, at least we're all together again.

272
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:18,662
MARISHA: We got to meet my family!

273
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:19,688
SAM: Wait, what?!

274
00:18:19,688 --> 00:18:20,522
MARISHA: Yeah!

275
00:18:20,522 --> 00:18:21,707
SAM: I missed everything.

276
00:18:21,707 --> 00:18:25,539
LAURA: What did you do for all the days we've been
gone now?

277
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:33,857
SAM: This was a long slumber party. We just kept
going and going, and at one point, I was like,

278
00:18:33,857 --> 00:18:38,946
okay, I'll see you-- oh, there's another meal?
Okay, I'll stick around for another day. And we

279
00:18:38,946 --> 00:18:40,325
just kept going.

280
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:42,083
TRAVIS: Did you do nails?

281
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:45,423
SAM: We did. Not my hands. Just my toenails.

282
00:18:45,423 --> 00:18:46,426
LAURA: All right.

283
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:52,253
SAM: We braided hair. We connected.

284
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:53,425
LAURA: That's wonderful.

285
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:54,924
TRAVIS: Connected.

286
00:18:54,924 --> 00:19:00,373
SAM: Well, at least we're all back. We can get on
the flying carpet and go somewhere fun.

287
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:01,623
LAURA: Oh no.

288
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:06,789
TRAVIS: Who wants to--

289
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:10,005
LAURA: Scanlan, you've missed everything!

290
00:19:10,005 --> 00:19:14,934
TRAVIS: Maybe we should let Keyleth explain where
the flying carpet went.

291
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:16,981
TALIESIN: Yes, Keyleth. Where is the flying
carpet?

292
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:18,600
MARISHA: Why do I have to explain it?

293
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,202
TRAVIS: You're right. Tiberius, where did the
flying carpet go?

294
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:25,437
ORION: It's right here. I open my Bag of Holding.
(swoosh) It just doesn't fly anymore.

295
00:19:25,437 --> 00:19:26,734
SAM: You have a Bag of Holding?

296
00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:31,826
ORION: I went to Draconia for like two minutes and
picked one up.

297
00:19:31,826 --> 00:19:32,972
SAM: That's really far.

298
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:36,778
ORION: Oh. Well, I teleported. I went there, came
back.

299
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:44,313
LAURA: So they killed the carpet. It lives no
more. They also spent a lot of money. But hey,

300
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:47,175
they didn't die, and that's a good thing.

301
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:48,678
SAM: That is a good thing.

302
00:19:48,678 --> 00:19:50,438
MARISHA: And we fought a devil.

303
00:19:50,438 --> 00:19:51,599
LAURA: A demon.

304
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,131
SAM: Whoa! The devil?

305
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:55,002
ORION: No, a rakshasa.

306
00:19:55,002 --> 00:19:58,587
TALIESIN: It seems that an enormous amount of
alcohol has given you some perspective. I'm very

307
00:19:58,587 --> 00:20:00,351
proud of you. Well done.

308
00:20:00,351 --> 00:20:01,543
LAURA: Thank you.

309
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:09,631
SAM: Well, thank you for catching me up, fellows.
What's our mission now? What are we doing now?

310
00:20:09,631 --> 00:20:11,828
LAURA: That is a good question.

311
00:20:11,828 --> 00:20:16,354
ORION: I have a suggestion. First I'm going to
bring up Lockheed. Keyleth,

312
00:20:16,354 --> 00:20:18,866
if you think you could help?

313
00:20:18,866 --> 00:20:24,993
SAM: What? I was gone for a day! There's a dragon
now?

314
00:20:24,993 --> 00:20:29,568
ORION: I'm going to take him out of his cage and
put him on the table here.

315
00:20:29,568 --> 00:20:33,384
MARISHA: Aw, he's got puppy breath. Oh, yes you
do. Yes you do.

316
00:20:33,384 --> 00:20:35,511
MATT: It is slightly worse than puppy breath.

317
00:20:35,511 --> 00:20:38,828
MARISHA: You want me to cure him of poison?

318
00:20:38,828 --> 00:20:47,777
ORION: He's diseased. You can maybe see if you
could perhaps use your medicine strengths to see

319
00:20:47,777 --> 00:20:48,977
what the problem is.

320
00:20:48,977 --> 00:20:52,155
MARISHA: I mean, the Heroes' Feast would have
worked.

321
00:20:52,155 --> 00:20:55,415
ORION: Yes, I know. That's why I asked earlier as
the other guy.

322
00:20:55,415 --> 00:21:01,654
LAURA: We did not have him with us then? We didn't
have him with us when we had the feast?

323
00:21:01,654 --> 00:21:02,725
ORION: No.

324
00:21:02,725 --> 00:21:06,549
LAURA: You didn't think of him at the time?

325
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:08,875
ORION: I said I fed him, but I didn't say what I
fed him.

326
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:12,570
TALIESIN: I have a strange thought.

327
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:13,550
LAURA: What?

328
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,739
TALIESIN: When was the last time we went home?

329
00:21:15,862 --> 00:21:20,686
LAURA: Well, okay. Here's the thing. If we're
going to go home-- Emon.

330
00:21:20,686 --> 00:21:21,947
TALIESIN: Greyskull.

331
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:27,457
LAURA: Right. If we're going to go home, I would
really, really like to stop by Kraghammer.

332
00:21:27,457 --> 00:21:28,805
TALIESIN: And pick up our money.

333
00:21:28,805 --> 00:21:31,038
LAURA: Yes. 25,000 gold.

334
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:36,248
TRAVIS: If we're going to leave, could I make a
small request?

335
00:21:36,248 --> 00:21:38,574
TALIESIN: You want to try again, don't you?

336
00:21:38,574 --> 00:21:40,859
TRAVIS: I have a bit of a chip on my shoulder.

337
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:42,143
MARISHA: Oh!

338
00:21:42,143 --> 00:21:50,265
TRAVIS: Would you mind terribly if I maybe went
out to the street and picked a fight?

339
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:51,546
TALIESIN: Oh, give me strength.

340
00:21:51,546 --> 00:21:57,939
MARISHA: Wait, go out on the street? You're not
going to chase down what's-his-butt?

341
00:21:57,939 --> 00:21:59,316
TRAVIS: I want Kern.

342
00:21:59,316 --> 00:22:00,923
MARISHA: Okay, we're going to find Kern.

343
00:22:00,923 --> 00:22:02,975
SAM: Are you sure about this?

344
00:22:02,975 --> 00:22:04,573
TRAVIS: I'm sure.

345
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:08,107
MARISHA: Hang on, are we going to go find Kern and
do this with rules, or we going to

346
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:09,780
do this without rules?

347
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,308
SAM: Without rules, you would win.

348
00:22:11,308 --> 00:22:14,445
TRAVIS: I can't do it. I have to do it by the
rules.

349
00:22:14,445 --> 00:22:16,938
LAURA: So you want to go in the Crucible again.

350
00:22:16,938 --> 00:22:25,656
TRAVIS: Yeah. Is there a tavern downstairs or
anywhere they'd have cups or wineskins?

351
00:22:25,656 --> 00:22:32,481
MATT: Within the guildhall, there is a mess hall
area. A kitchen would have cups, but it's not a

352
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:33,637
full tavern.

353
00:22:33,637 --> 00:22:35,815
LAURA: Tiberius, do you have any wineskins or
anything?

354
00:22:35,815 --> 00:22:37,649
ORION: Excuse me?

355
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:39,046
LAURA: Do you have a wineskin?

356
00:22:39,046 --> 00:22:41,648
ORION: Oh, I'm sorry. I was waiting on my first
request before.

357
00:22:41,648 --> 00:22:43,110
SAM: Oh, what was your first request?

358
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:47,395
ORION: To see if Keyleth could do anything, but a
wineskin? Yes.

359
00:22:47,395 --> 00:22:48,817
LAURA and TRAVIS: Oh, thank you.

360
00:22:48,817 --> 00:22:55,100
MARISHA: Can I do a check to see if I can tell
what Lockheed has? What kind of disease?

361
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,124
MATT: Sure. Go ahead and make a medicine check.

362
00:22:57,124 --> 00:22:59,438
SAM: Oh, it's sick? Get me away from it.

363
00:22:59,438 --> 00:23:00,864
MARISHA: 21.

364
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:07,433
MATT: 21. Looking at Lockheed, you get the feeling
that his disease essentially comes from a

365
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:13,647
continuous time period of poor meat being
presented as a meal option. It's less of a magical

366
00:23:13,647 --> 00:23:17,787
or any sort of unnatural disease. It's just
something that is passing through his system.

367
00:23:17,787 --> 00:23:19,025
ORION: Emaciated?

368
00:23:19,025 --> 00:23:24,446
MATT: Not too emaciated. More that some bad meat
has found its system, which means without

369
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:28,655
treatment over time, his health could diminish.
However, if the food you've been feeding him has

370
00:23:28,655 --> 00:23:33,807
been a decent level, if this continues, it might
clear. It could be aided through the use of simple

371
00:23:33,807 --> 00:23:36,428
healing salves and/or natural remedies.

372
00:23:36,428 --> 00:23:42,281
MARISHA: Can I make a few Goodberries for him and
feed him a few more Goodberries?

373
00:23:42,281 --> 00:23:43,566
MATT: Sure.

374
00:23:43,566 --> 00:23:45,042
TALIESIN: Why not great berries?

375
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:48,716
MARISHA: Well, I guess that's a matter of opinion,
Percy.

376
00:23:48,716 --> 00:23:55,292
ORION: As far as the matters at hand: I, of
course, Grog, encourage your violence. And

377
00:23:55,292 --> 00:23:58,481
Taliesin, I do quite like the idea of going back
to Emon--

378
00:23:58,481 --> 00:24:00,871
LAURA: Who did you just-- who did you just--

379
00:24:00,871 --> 00:24:05,926
TALIESIN: You just NPCed me. Just NPCed me all
over the place.

380
00:24:05,926 --> 00:24:09,326
ORION: Oh, sorry. I'm sorry, speaking Draconic
again. Percy.

381
00:24:09,326 --> 00:24:14,547
TALIESIN: Taliesin is my mother's name, please.
No.

382
00:24:14,547 --> 00:24:17,313
ORION: Sorry. No, that's not your mother's name.

383
00:24:17,313 --> 00:24:20,650
TALIESIN: It's not my mother's name. She wasn't
well. Carry on.

384
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,712
LAURA: What was your mother's name?

385
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:27,018
ORION: I'm sorry. Percival. I go over to Percival
and I give him a hug.

386
00:24:27,018 --> 00:24:28,707
TALIESIN: Oh god.

387
00:24:28,707 --> 00:24:30,411
ORION: Sorry, I'm scaly.

388
00:24:30,411 --> 00:24:32,781
TALIESIN: It's all right. We didn't touch in my
family. Go ahead.

389
00:24:32,781 --> 00:24:38,475
ORION: I like the idea of going back to Emon, but
before that, I do believe we should go back to

390
00:24:38,475 --> 00:24:40,325
Kraghammer and collect our gold.

391
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:41,268
TALIESIN and LAURA: Yes.

392
00:24:41,268 --> 00:24:42,473
ORION: Did we say that already?

393
00:24:42,473 --> 00:24:43,437
TALIESIN and LAURA: We did.

394
00:24:43,437 --> 00:24:45,020
ORION: Wonderful. I was concerned about Lockheed.

395
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,574
MARISHA: So much has happened.

396
00:24:46,574 --> 00:24:48,532
ORION: I'm going to put him on my shoulder.

397
00:24:48,532 --> 00:24:51,245
TRAVIS: Did you say you encourage my violence?

398
00:24:51,245 --> 00:24:52,020
ORION: Of course.

399
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,610
TRAVIS: I take off running out the room.

400
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:56,069
(laughter)

401
00:24:56,069 --> 00:24:59,029
MARISHA: Oh, Tiberius. You have to be careful. You
have to be responsible--

402
00:24:59,029 --> 00:25:00,570
TRAVIS: Was there a window in the room?

403
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,586
MATT: No, not in this one.

404
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:03,913
TRAVIS: Okay, just checking.

405
00:25:03,913 --> 00:25:06,913
TALIESIN: Was there a Looney Tunes hole in the
wall?

406
00:25:06,913 --> 00:25:10,151
(laughter)

407
00:25:10,151 --> 00:25:13,700
MATT: So as Grog bounds off into the distance, do
you guys give chase?

408
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,079
ORION and TALIESIN: Yes!

409
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:17,389
MATT: You get out into the main thoroughfare.

410
00:25:17,389 --> 00:25:20,569
MARISHA: We really need to make that leash for
him, like we said we were going to.

411
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:24,664
MATT: As you make your way to the main
thoroughfare, you look over and you catch the

412
00:25:24,664 --> 00:25:30,189
image of the distant goliath heading northward
towards the Braving Grounds, just plowing through

413
00:25:30,189 --> 00:25:34,022
the crowd. You see a couple people that are
knocked flat onto their ass, like head shaking,

414
00:25:34,022 --> 00:25:36,699
"what just happened?" as he just goes bounding
into the distance.

415
00:25:36,699 --> 00:25:38,952
MARISHA: Follow the trail of distressed people!

416
00:25:38,952 --> 00:25:44,031
ORION: I give chase. I give myself Fly so I can go
over the crowd.

417
00:25:44,031 --> 00:25:50,857
MATT: As you glide over the crowd, you can see a
few Bastions glance up and narrow their eyes and

418
00:25:50,857 --> 00:25:52,717
begin whispering to themselves.

419
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:57,181
ORION: It's fine! I realize what I'm doing, and I
stop.

420
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:04,873
TALIESIN: That's going on your tombstone: I
realize what I'm doing, and I stop.

421
00:26:04,873 --> 00:26:11,499
MATT: As you enter the group, you, Percy, thanks
to him, notice that there are now no less than

422
00:26:11,499 --> 00:26:15,274
five Bastions keeping a 30-foot distance walking and
following behind Tiberius.

423
00:26:15,326 --> 00:26:22,967
LAURA: I go up and I tell Tiberius, maybe it's
best just to keep a low profile for a while. And I

424
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:27,213
turn around and wave at the Bastions.

425
00:26:27,213 --> 00:26:29,277
TALIESIN: It's all right. He's from Emon.

426
00:26:29,277 --> 00:26:32,691
MATT: As soon as you wave and make that
interaction, they break off in two and three and

427
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,799
go in different directions and disappear into the
crowd.

428
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,647
LAURA: Cool. That was fun.

429
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:38,250
TALIESIN: Hunter's Mark one of them.

430
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,709
LAURA: Yeah, I'll Hunter's Mark one of them.

431
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:41,751
ORION: Do they feel that?

432
00:26:41,751 --> 00:26:44,152
LAURA: Oh, wait. Can they feel that?

433
00:26:44,152 --> 00:26:47,123
MATT: Go ahead and make a sleight-of-hand check on
this.

434
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:57,197
LAURA: Oh gosh. Wait, which one should I roll
first? Okay. Hold on.

435
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:59,442
Natural 20, what!

436
00:26:59,442 --> 00:27:09,984
MATT: You are the anti-Wheaton as of late. It's
kind of amazing. All right, yeah. You Hunter's

437
00:27:09,984 --> 00:27:14,115
Mark one of the Bastions who wanders off in the
crowd, and you have a very good idea of where he

438
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:18,398
and/or the cluster that's with him is moving. As
you guys progress, following this path that Grog

439
00:27:18,443 --> 00:27:24,136
is carving through the crowd, heading for the main
bazaar area at the center of the Quad Roads

440
00:27:24,136 --> 00:27:30,758
district, heading northwestern, up into the Braving
Grounds of Vasselheim, you can also sense that

441
00:27:30,758 --> 00:27:35,708
they are following, though at a good 60-foot
distance, keeping an eye on the red-scaled

442
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:42,373
dragonborn that then flew out into the open air of
the midday sun, with his tinier dragon, his very

443
00:27:42,373 --> 00:27:48,340
meta dragon-on-dragon action. You continue pushing
into the Braving Grounds area. You can see, now,

444
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:54,623
giant black smokestacks that are billowing up from
the various blacksmithies, and there is a large

445
00:27:54,623 --> 00:27:59,321
industrial iron complex that is used in the mining
and reforming of all the weapons and armor that go

446
00:27:59,321 --> 00:28:03,998
to the Bastions of the city here in the Braving
Grounds. You make your way up towards the Bellows'

447
00:28:03,998 --> 00:28:09,529
Respite Inn, to where the Crucible itself is held
in the center. As you approach, it is midday.

448
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:14,429
There's no crowd gathered. The Crucible is
currently empty and left on its own. You glance

449
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:17,997
about for a second, and there's nobody here
running any sort of fight ring.

450
00:28:17,997 --> 00:28:20,352
SAM: Damn it, you'll have to come back.

451
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:24,106
TRAVIS: (shouting) Kern!

452
00:28:24,106 --> 00:28:27,480
MATT: As you're shouting into the air, a few
people nearby--

453
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:35,368
TRAVIS: And the Star Trek reference is good. His
name's Kern; it's fun.

454
00:28:35,368 --> 00:28:42,557
MATT: Nearby individuals drop their stuff and look
over as this billowing, deep goliath voice fills

455
00:28:42,557 --> 00:28:51,697
the air around the center of this mildly
business-as-usual road vicinity. Suddenly, a few

456
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:55,679
individuals come looking out from inside the
Bellows' Respite Inn. It has a tavern portion to

457
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:02,771
the front. One of them is Once-Lucky Ned, who is
the person that runs the tavern. He's a human

458
00:29:02,771 --> 00:29:11,025
barkeep that wanders out and, "You! Philip!
Yelling Kern?" And you see this look on his face.

459
00:29:11,025 --> 00:29:16,152
TRAVIS: Bring me the body of Kern.

460
00:29:16,152 --> 00:29:18,564
LAURA: Alive! Alive.

461
00:29:18,564 --> 00:29:20,156
ORION: He wants to fight him.

462
00:29:20,156 --> 00:29:24,872
MATT: He cocks his head a little bit at you. "Just
a moment. Stay right there."

463
00:29:24,872 --> 00:29:26,306
And he runs back inside.

464
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,488
SAM: There's going to be a street fight!

465
00:29:28,488 --> 00:29:33,883
MARISHA: I hear Scanlan say that and I run out and
I say, (shouting) fight!

466
00:29:33,883 --> 00:29:38,463
MATT: At this point, other members of the tavern
are starting to come out, tankards in hand, like,

467
00:29:38,463 --> 00:29:45,353
"what's going on?" They see you. "Oh! There's
going to be a fight at the Crucible!" You hear the

468
00:29:45,353 --> 00:29:49,059
shouts going off the nearby houses; it's echoing,
like town crier to town crier. You're hearing

469
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:54,345
voices echo throughout the entirety of the Braving
Grounds: people preparing for this midday

470
00:29:54,345 --> 00:30:01,284
unexpected throwdown. At this point, you see a few
of the Bastions wearing the armor that is geared

471
00:30:01,284 --> 00:30:04,538
towards Kord, the god of strength that runs this
portion of Vasselheim.

472
00:30:04,538 --> 00:30:06,095
LAURA: The ones that I'm keeping an eye on?

473
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,068
MATT: No, the ones that you're keeping an eye on
were from the Quad Roads, and they're still

474
00:30:08,068 --> 00:30:12,306
staying back. One of them, the one that you've
marked, is around the corner, just keeping an eye

475
00:30:12,306 --> 00:30:16,005
on everybody, but he's mainly keeping to himself.
He does stand out like a sore thumb because his

476
00:30:16,005 --> 00:30:25,637
armor is darker and based around Erathis, whereas
here the Bastions that are under Kord's vision

477
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:29,336
have more of a red, dark, almost rusty look to
their armor.

478
00:30:29,336 --> 00:30:35,410
Anyway, as the shouts continue, some of the Kord
Bastions gather, one of which you recognize as the

479
00:30:35,446 --> 00:30:42,901
one who was acting as the bookie the first time
you came to the Crucible. And he looks-- wiping

480
00:30:42,901 --> 00:30:47,048
sleep from his eyes-- he looks like he just got
into his armor and rushed out here for about ten

481
00:30:47,048 --> 00:30:49,913
minutes since you just came out here and shouted
your challenge to the sky.

482
00:30:49,913 --> 00:30:51,601
He rushes out for a second.

483
00:30:51,601 --> 00:31:02,699
"You! Hey, am I to hear properly that you are 
challenging our standing champion once again?"

484
00:31:02,699 --> 00:31:04,513
TRAVIS: Aye, you heard right.

485
00:31:04,513 --> 00:31:06,743
MATT: "Midday, now, under the noonday sun?"

486
00:31:06,743 --> 00:31:11,078
TRAVIS: Aye, where everyone can see, and he can't
hide.

487
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:19,864
MATT: He glances over to another Bastion that's to
his left. "Get Kern. Now." He rushes off and he

488
00:31:19,887 --> 00:31:26,828
looks back to you. "Well, then. A fight we're
going to have." At this point now, there's

489
00:31:26,828 --> 00:31:30,206
probably about 20, 25 people that are beginning to
gather around the outskirts of the Crucible around

490
00:31:30,206 --> 00:31:35,197
you. "Oh, it's Philip! Philip's showing down
with Kern!" There's all these different whispers

491
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:39,121
now going throughout the crowd as the rest of you
gather. The Bastion that you've been following

492
00:31:39,121 --> 00:31:43,889
backs off and stays further back, and is slowly
keeping a distance further away as the crowd

493
00:31:43,889 --> 00:31:48,381
begins to gather, wanting to stay inconspicuous
amongst all this chaos and

494
00:31:48,381 --> 00:31:49,594
rabble you guys have collected.

495
00:31:49,594 --> 00:31:53,417
MARISHA: I join in with everybody else. Yeah, did
you see that, Kern's fighting Philip!

496
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:55,149
TALIESIN: Why are you telling me this? Of course I
know.

497
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:57,120
MARISHA: Kern's fighting--

498
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,187
ORION: I also know.

499
00:31:58,187 --> 00:31:59,191
MARISHA: Shit.

500
00:31:59,191 --> 00:32:05,561
LAURA: Can I try, subtly, to pass off my ring of
AC to Grog?

501
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:10,000
MATT: Grog, do you have any enchantment of
protection, currently?

502
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,134
TRAVIS: Nope.

503
00:32:11,134 --> 00:32:12,132
MATT: You do not?

504
00:32:12,132 --> 00:32:13,063
TRAVIS: I don't.

505
00:32:13,063 --> 00:32:15,172
MATT: On the ring, does it say attunement
required?

506
00:32:15,172 --> 00:32:20,843
LAURA: No. It doesn't, I don't think. Hold on, let
me look.

507
00:32:20,843 --> 00:32:23,440
MATT: I can look it up for you, if need be.

508
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,628
LAURA: Ring of Protection.

509
00:32:24,628 --> 00:32:26,812
TRAVIS: Yeah, my Belt of Dwarvenkind is the only
thing, but that's all.

510
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:30,246
LAURA: It just says plus two bonus to AC and
saving throw-- oh, requires attunement.

511
00:32:30,246 --> 00:32:32,996
MATT: Yeah, you have to take time to go ahead and
attune to the magical item.

512
00:32:32,996 --> 00:32:34,687
LAURA: Damn it! I'm sorry, Grog.

513
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:35,583
TRAVIS: It's all right.

514
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:37,893
LAURA: You shouldn't have taken off running!

515
00:32:37,893 --> 00:32:42,909
MATT: (laughs) About 20 minutes pass by as the
crowd is now gathered, about 50 to 60 people.

516
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:47,360
Apparently, word of your last battle has gotten
around, and now there's this fevered pitch of

517
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,796
interest. People have dropped what they're doing
and the smokestacks you can see have slowly turned

518
00:32:51,796 --> 00:32:58,680
to a dribble as everyone who's working the nearby
forges and/or smelting irons have rushed out here

519
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,359
to see this battle and dropped what they're doing.
This has turned into full-on,

520
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:04,703
"Morpheus is fighting Neo."

521
00:33:04,703 --> 00:33:10,672
TRAVIS: I turn to the bookie, and I take out my
entire coin purse, and I throw it at him.

522
00:33:10,672 --> 00:33:13,827
ORION: I use my Mage Hand--

523
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:15,151
LAURA: No, don't use magic!

524
00:33:15,151 --> 00:33:16,664
ORION: Oh no, I don't! I don't do that!

525
00:33:16,664 --> 00:33:20,190
TALIESIN: We whack him on the head before he
starts to do the hand. Stop it!

526
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:25,687
TRAVIS: I throw him the coin purse and I say, I
expect to see that doubled when I get out. And I

527
00:33:25,687 --> 00:33:27,855
jump into the pit before Kern even arrives.

528
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:33,130
MATT: You leap and the whole crowd goes (cheering)
and this series of shouting screams surround the

529
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,606
air around you. He grabs the coin purse-- how much
is in that coin purse?

530
00:33:35,606 --> 00:33:40,010
TRAVIS: According to this, it's eleven-- that
can't be right, can it?

531
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,325
SAM: 11,000?

532
00:33:41,325 --> 00:33:42,477
LAURA: Personal funds?!

533
00:33:42,477 --> 00:33:44,477
MATT: Your personal funds, not what's in the Bag
of Holding.

534
00:33:44,477 --> 00:33:45,653
TRAVIS: 1,363.

535
00:33:45,653 --> 00:33:48,634
MATT: 1,363 gold pieces.

536
00:33:48,634 --> 00:33:52,866
LAURA: That's normal. He probably has more than
that.

537
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:54,384
MARISHA: You should start charging admission at
the door.

538
00:33:54,384 --> 00:33:56,537
SAM: I run up. There's a bookie here?

539
00:33:56,537 --> 00:33:58,073
MATT: There is a bookie.

540
00:33:58,073 --> 00:34:03,058
SAM: I run up to him and very subtly say, I'd like
a hundred against Grog, please.

541
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:05,186
(laughter)

542
00:34:05,186 --> 00:34:10,254
MATT: Okay. He looks down at you and says, "Not
bad. Going with the odds.

543
00:34:10,254 --> 00:34:11,713
"It's three to one against him."

544
00:34:11,713 --> 00:34:15,552
SAM: All right, yes. Just don't mention if I win.
Maybe I'll come and collect later.

545
00:34:15,552 --> 00:34:16,772
ORION: I have 600 gold pieces--

546
00:34:16,772 --> 00:34:17,836
MATT: You don't hear this.

547
00:34:17,836 --> 00:34:20,177
SAM: I'll collect later. Don't say anything.

548
00:34:20,177 --> 00:34:22,394
MATT: "All right."

549
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:29,809
TALIESIN: Good chap, I'd like to place a bet. 500
gold pieces on Philip.

550
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:34,441
MATT: "On to Philip. All right. (laughs) 500."

551
00:34:34,441 --> 00:34:40,408
ORION: I'm going to break my bank and follow suit
to my human friend. 612 is, I think,

552
00:34:40,408 --> 00:34:41,527
all I have left.

553
00:34:41,527 --> 00:34:49,982
MATT: "Curious number, but certainly." At this
time, the crowd gets a little more hushed, people

554
00:34:49,982 --> 00:34:54,903
are like, "Oh." And you see-- you don't see this,
because you're down in the Crucible-- you see the

555
00:34:54,903 --> 00:35:00,360
crowd, which has probably gathered close to 70
plus people, part, and you see walking over, soot

556
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,863
smeared across the front of his face, stepping up
is Kern the Hammer, with a bristled, half-orc

557
00:35:04,863 --> 00:35:09,585
mustache, a little bit tousled from a day of hard
work, sweat glistening off the top of his brow and

558
00:35:09,585 --> 00:35:10,987
the top of his head.

559
00:35:10,987 --> 00:35:13,117
TRAVIS: He's missing a lip.

560
00:35:13,117 --> 00:35:19,873
MATT: As he approaches, you can see-- there has
been some healing through the quick work of the

561
00:35:19,873 --> 00:35:24,576
clerics who worked after the last battle. However,
there is definitely a section of his upper lip

562
00:35:24,576 --> 00:35:29,121
that is permanently missing, looking almost like a
half-cleft palate. You can see beneath it, his

563
00:35:29,121 --> 00:35:33,257
sneering yellowed teeth grinding as he approaches
the Crucible.

564
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:35,620
TALIESIN: I believe in you, Philip.

565
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,840
LAURA: I'm going to bet.

566
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,123
MATT: You're going to bet?

567
00:35:39,123 --> 00:35:41,896
LAURA: I'm going to bet. I'm going to put 600 on
Philip!

568
00:35:41,896 --> 00:35:44,828
MARISHA: So wait, this betting thing is
enjoyable?

569
00:35:44,828 --> 00:35:47,009
ORION: No, it's not. It's a gamble.

570
00:35:47,009 --> 00:35:48,482
MARISHA: It feels bad?

571
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:50,740
TALIESIN: It's terrible.

572
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,108
MARISHA: So why do we do it?

573
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:55,520
ORION: So we can make more, and plus, it's giving
faith in our friend.

574
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,916
LAURA: It's inspiration.

575
00:35:59,077 --> 00:36:01,811
MARISHA: I'll bet five gold on Philip.

576
00:36:01,811 --> 00:36:07,641
TRAVIS: (laughs) That's an excellent bet. That is
an excellent bet, Keyleth.

577
00:36:07,641 --> 00:36:10,472
MARISHA: Thank you! Is that how it works?

578
00:36:10,472 --> 00:36:16,163
MATT: Vax stands behind you and is like, "Yes,
I'll stand behind your bet," and keeps his gold to

579
00:36:16,163 --> 00:36:22,407
himself. At this point, the crowd separates. This
tension's mounting, and everyone's eyes are on

580
00:36:22,407 --> 00:36:27,065
Kern as he steps up to the edge of the Crucible.
You now notice the dark figure. The noonday sun is

581
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:31,265
now high in the sky, and you can see, by the
little bit of the shadowed outline of Kern,

582
00:36:31,265 --> 00:36:37,330
muscle-bound, looming over the edge of the
Crucible. You hear a voice call down to you, low

583
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:44,725
and gravelly and familiar. "You! Did you like the
gift I sent you?"

584
00:36:44,725 --> 00:36:51,382
TRAVIS: I reach into my belt and I pull out his
upper lip, and I give it a smell and I say, I've

585
00:36:51,382 --> 00:36:55,631
enjoyed it very much. I've come to collect the
rest. And I fling it into the pit.

586
00:36:55,631 --> 00:37:04,330
MATT: It hits the ground. "You're not wearing the
medal. A shame, really. I thought you'd be more

587
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:11,648
"proud of your status." (whoosh, thud). He leaps
down into the pit right before you, this grin on

588
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:17,636
his face. As everyone's gathering around, people
are now swarming the bookie, handing gold left and

589
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:22,231
right, and he's making notes in his little ledger
out of his pocket. People are beginning to gather

590
00:37:22,231 --> 00:37:25,347
around and crush against the outsides of the
Crucible with some people being careful, almost

591
00:37:25,347 --> 00:37:30,660
being pushed in. At this point in time, now,
Kern's glaring at you and you guys are slowly

592
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:41,861
circling each other. (grunts) "You've been
training, I see. Good. So have I!" He goes and

593
00:37:41,861 --> 00:37:43,675
takes his wine skin, pops off the top--

594
00:37:43,675 --> 00:37:52,158
TRAVIS: Hold! Surely a man of your stature would
honor me by sharing a drink before this battle.

595
00:37:52,158 --> 00:38:03,024
MATT: He takes (glugging) and throws you the
wineskin.

596
00:38:03,024 --> 00:38:05,730
TRAVIS: How much is left in there?

597
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:13,298
MATT: About a third. You're clutching it in your
hand, and he's staring at you intently.

598
00:38:13,298 --> 00:38:20,794
TRAVIS: (sniff, sniff) I don't drink such piss
water. I pour it out. I take out my own wineskin

599
00:38:20,794 --> 00:38:25,367
that I filled with the stone giant strength, and I
chug it down.

600
00:38:25,367 --> 00:38:27,022
SAM: He's juicing!

601
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:30,165
MARISHA: Oh shit!

602
00:38:30,165 --> 00:38:31,573
TALIESIN: Oh!

603
00:38:31,573 --> 00:38:36,580
MATT: You see him snarl to the side as you toss
his wineskin to the ground and you chug your own.

604
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:41,115
It tastes very heavily-- this is frost giant
strength, you said?

605
00:38:41,115 --> 00:38:42,946
TRAVIS: Or the stone giant, yeah.

606
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:50,044
MATT: Oh, the stone giant. It tastes very heavily
of black charcoal, dust, grit, and the actual

607
00:38:50,044 --> 00:38:54,150
liquid itself has a very gravelly texture as it
goes down your throat, and you can feel chunks

608
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:58,052
getting caught, but you push through and continue
gulping it. It's thicker, like a molasses, than it

609
00:38:58,052 --> 00:39:02,799
is an actual liquid. You finish it off, toss it to
the side. Go ahead and mark your increase to

610
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:03,924
strength for this.

611
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,172
TRAVIS: I got it down already.

612
00:39:05,172 --> 00:39:08,547
(laughter)

613
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:09,885
MATT: You came prepared!

614
00:39:09,885 --> 00:39:15,092
TRAVIS: (singing) We're going to need a montage, a
montage.

615
00:39:15,092 --> 00:39:20,530
MATT: (laughs) You toss your wineskin to the side.
The bookie, you hear now, raises his hand. "All

616
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:31,689
"here in attendance. We have here in the Crucible
this day, a rematch of titans. The standing

617
00:39:31,689 --> 00:39:41,963
"champion of all the Braving Grounds of Vasselheim:
Kern the Hammer." (cheers)

618
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:45,215
(booing)

619
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:49,952
MATT: Coins start raining on you: copper, silver,
and gold pieces spin down on the ground around

620
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:57,279
you, Grog. You guys just stand tensely locked in
that warrior glare. "Challenging him, once again,

621
00:39:57,279 --> 00:40:07,448
"tail between his legs, intent on claiming his
glory, returning to the Crucible, Philip."

622
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:17,137
TRAVIS: No! Philip is dead. There is no Philip.
There is only Grog, the Vengeful.

623
00:40:17,137 --> 00:40:20,511
(cheering)

624
00:40:20,511 --> 00:40:25,591
MATT: Cheers go up around the outside of the
Crucible. You can now see the entire crowd-- the

625
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:31,255
energy itself is electric in the air; eyes are
intense and bloodshot. Everyone is looking down

626
00:40:31,255 --> 00:40:36,443
into what is about to be, hopefully, a drag-out,
throwdown fight. You feel the rippling strength of

627
00:40:36,443 --> 00:40:43,584
your stone giant elders tearing through your body.
You flex, and you hear with each muscle tensing

628
00:40:43,584 --> 00:40:47,746
and the popping of bones and sinew as you prepare
yourself for this. As you're doing this, you see

629
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:54,904
across the way, Kern cracks his knuckles, and you
can see the giant scar from his snarling lip. You

630
00:40:54,904 --> 00:40:59,367
realize he hasn't been snarling this whole time;
it's just the natural state of his current smile.

631
00:40:59,367 --> 00:41:07,240
And then he snarls. You can see his orcish tusks
protruding out, and the gums themselves, black and

632
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,439
purple, peering out from underneath his upper lip
that you once destroyed.

633
00:41:10,439 --> 00:41:14,580
"I'm going to take yours this time, boy."

634
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:19,542
TRAVIS: Enough words, toothless. Let's do this.

635
00:41:19,542 --> 00:41:21,169
MATT: Roll initiative.

636
00:41:21,169 --> 00:41:28,745
TRAVIS: Oh, I get advantage, don't I? That's
better. 20.

637
00:41:28,745 --> 00:41:31,558
MARISHA: Music change!

638
00:41:31,558 --> 00:41:34,993
SAM: How did you have that ready?

639
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:40,197
TALIESIN: Witchcraft!

640
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:47,639
MATT: I keep all my stuff at the ready, just in
case. All right.

641
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:49,416
TALIESIN: Are we that predictable?

642
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:55,715
MATT: I have a whole cluster over here. So what'd
you get for initiative, in total?

643
00:41:55,715 --> 00:41:56,847
TRAVIS: 20.

644
00:41:56,847 --> 00:42:02,608
MARISHA: There's papers just littering our
apartment, just information.

645
00:42:02,608 --> 00:42:05,472
MATT: I have clusters and clusters of maps that
are either used or unused, at all times.

646
00:42:05,472 --> 00:42:08,045
All righty.

647
00:42:08,045 --> 00:42:09,914
MARISHA: Our house is a D&amp;D cave.

648
00:42:09,914 --> 00:42:16,400
MATT: I'm so sorry. As you're preparing for this
circumstance, you are up first.

649
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,368
Grog, you have initiative.

650
00:42:18,368 --> 00:42:24,276
TRAVIS: I race towards Kern, and I duck down as if
I'm going to go into a form tackle towards his

651
00:42:24,276 --> 00:42:30,950
waist. I take a step to the side at the last
second and wrap my arms around his waist from

652
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:34,508
behind, pick him up to DDT him over my shoulder.

653
00:42:34,508 --> 00:42:37,402
(cheering)

654
00:42:37,402 --> 00:42:38,910
ORION: The DDT!

655
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,009
MARISHA: The DDT!

656
00:42:40,009 --> 00:42:42,841
MATT: Okay. For this, go ahead and make an
athletics check.

657
00:42:42,841 --> 00:42:48,455
TRAVIS: Okay. (laughs) 25.

658
00:42:48,455 --> 00:42:49,578
MATT: 25.

659
00:42:49,578 --> 00:42:51,060
TRAVIS: 18 plus seven.

660
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:58,449
MATT: He rolled a 23. 15 plus eight. So you rush
up behind and he goes in for the feint, attempts

661
00:42:58,449 --> 00:43:02,698
to parry. However, you vanish from the side. He
feels the arms wrap around him and he reaches down

662
00:43:02,698 --> 00:43:06,365
instinctively to try and pry them away, but it's
too late as you lift him up off of his back and

663
00:43:06,365 --> 00:43:13,242
(whack) send him onto the ground. Go ahead and
roll 1d2 plus your strength modifier.

664
00:43:13,242 --> 00:43:15,634
LAURA: 1d-what? Two?

665
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,200
MATT: Well, it's 1d4 divided by two.

666
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,130
TRAVIS: Six.

667
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:25,202
MATT: Six, all right. (impact noise) So he took
the damage. There's no attacks this round,

668
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:33,965
currently; however, he is currently prone. He is
prone on the ground right there. As you slam him

669
00:43:33,965 --> 00:43:37,636
onto the ground and release him, he falls to the
ground and you hear (pained grunt) this exhale of

670
00:43:37,636 --> 00:43:40,764
pain. All right, you also have a bonus action,
still.

671
00:43:40,764 --> 00:43:48,908
TRAVIS: Right, with that action, I would like to
go into-- does it take an action to rage?

672
00:43:48,908 --> 00:43:51,056
MATT: It takes a bonus action for you to rage.

673
00:43:51,056 --> 00:43:52,160
TRAVIS: Which is what this is?

674
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,136
MATT: Yes.

675
00:43:53,136 --> 00:43:54,451
TRAVIS: I would like to rage.

676
00:43:54,451 --> 00:43:56,363
(cheering)

677
00:43:56,363 --> 00:44:00,371
MATT: And with that, as you see his form crumple
on the ground, he gets up to one knee and begins

678
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:06,262
standing up, wiping off a little bit of the dust
that's been smeared across his slobbered chin. You

679
00:44:06,262 --> 00:44:11,167
look down at him, and the light that's pouring
down from the sun that was once white and yellow

680
00:44:11,167 --> 00:44:18,059
in tone now turns to red as your eyes focus on
your quarry before you. That ends your turn.

681
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:29,149
Kern uses half movement to stand up. (grunts)
Looks at you and gives this chuckle. (slow

682
00:44:29,149 --> 00:44:34,582
chuckle) "This early, then? So be it." Bites the
edge of his wrist and tears a chunk of his own

683
00:44:34,582 --> 00:44:41,913
flesh off the side of his arm. (tearing sound,
heavy breathing) Uses his bonus action to rage.

684
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:47,844
Goes into his frenzied rage, as well. And he's
coming at you with both fists. One thing you

685
00:44:47,844 --> 00:44:52,229
notice, strangely: Kern, who previously seemed to
throw haymakers at you, before,

686
00:44:52,229 --> 00:44:54,398
goes into a stance.

687
00:44:54,398 --> 00:44:57,579
LAURA: He's been training!

688
00:44:57,579 --> 00:44:59,066
ORION: He monked up!

689
00:44:59,066 --> 00:45:09,061
MATT: And goes into swing two heavy fists at you.
That is going to be a-- Let's see, 24?

690
00:45:09,061 --> 00:45:10,205
TRAVIS: That hits.

691
00:45:10,205 --> 00:45:13,315
MATT: Ooh, that is going to be a 27.

692
00:45:13,315 --> 00:45:14,409
TRAVIS: Yeah, that'll hit, too.

693
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:18,302
MATT: All right, first hit is nine points of
damage.

694
00:45:18,356 --> 00:45:19,308
TRAVIS: Okay.

695
00:45:19,308 --> 00:45:21,004
MATT: Second one is eight points of damage.

696
00:45:21,004 --> 00:45:22,819
TRAVIS: He got nine points of damage?

697
00:45:22,819 --> 00:45:25,913
MATT: (whack, whack) Yeah. And for those who are
paying attention: they're both raging, they both

698
00:45:25,913 --> 00:45:29,608
take half damage, but since they're both doing it,
we're negating both abilities because otherwise

699
00:45:29,608 --> 00:45:31,072
this battle would take three hours.

700
00:45:31,072 --> 00:45:35,659
(whack, whack) These fists, you see as they hit
you, they're not just extremely strong and

701
00:45:35,659 --> 00:45:40,069
powerful previously, but they're hitting precise
areas where you feel the muscle and bone is less

702
00:45:40,069 --> 00:45:42,998
resistant. There is technique to these punches
that wasn't there before.

703
00:45:42,998 --> 00:45:45,296
TRAVIS: No problem!

704
00:45:45,296 --> 00:45:54,033
MATT: He is going to dodge to the side here.
(whoosh) Dodge off to the side (whoosh). Prepares

705
00:45:54,033 --> 00:45:56,308
himself, fists ready, for a defensive action.
It's your go.

706
00:45:56,308 --> 00:46:02,946
TRAVIS: All right, I would like to enter a
frenzied rage, and I would like to-- since he

707
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,889
moves off to my side, I see him move, and I throw
a back fist into the concave area of his nose.

708
00:46:09,889 --> 00:46:11,066
MATT: Okay.

709
00:46:11,066 --> 00:46:13,822
TRAVIS: 23.

710
00:46:13,822 --> 00:46:14,872
MATT: 23 hits.

711
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:19,239
TRAVIS: Great. That is-- motherfucker, six.

712
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:20,655
MATT: Six damage?

713
00:46:20,655 --> 00:46:21,392
TRAVIS: Yes.

714
00:46:21,392 --> 00:46:22,313
MATT: All righty.

715
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:27,929
TRAVIS: I would like to then reach forward, as
he's reeling back from that hit, with both of my

716
00:46:27,929 --> 00:46:30,415
thumbs and throw them towards his eyes.

717
00:46:30,415 --> 00:46:38,709
MATT: You're going to attempt to blind? All right,
so what this is going to be is for your second

718
00:46:38,709 --> 00:46:44,465
attack, a loose grapple, and we'll see if you can
manage to push forward from that point. So go

719
00:46:44,465 --> 00:46:46,627
ahead and make an athletics check.

720
00:46:46,627 --> 00:46:49,273
TRAVIS: 14.

721
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:54,210
MATT: 14. That is going to be a 16 on his end,
unfortunately. As you reach up, he (whoosh) slaps

722
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:59,039
the hands away. His defensive posture-- he was
ready for that sort of advance and he just knocks

723
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:03,522
them to the side with a grin. Yeah. You do still
have a bonus action, if you wish to use it.

724
00:47:03,522 --> 00:47:07,651
TRAVIS: If he knocks it aside, I take my right leg
and I throw it to the outside of his kneecap,

725
00:47:07,651 --> 00:47:09,818
trying to snap his ACL or MCL.

726
00:47:09,818 --> 00:47:11,479
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for the attack on
that.

727
00:47:11,479 --> 00:47:13,663
TRAVIS: That's a 27.

728
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,180
MATT: 27 does indeed hit.

729
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:20,233
TRAVIS: Why didn't that happen before? That's
seven.

730
00:47:20,233 --> 00:47:29,931
MATT: Seven points of damage? Oof, all right. As
he pushes your hands out of the way, (whack) a

731
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:35,336
resounding snap sound as your foot hits the side
of his thigh. His leg muscles themselves are like

732
00:47:35,336 --> 00:47:39,314
a tree trunk and take most of the impact of the
damage and you see him (pained cry). You can see

733
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:45,316
the pain in his face. His grin gives way to a
sudden grimace of pain. Your leg is now held in

734
00:47:45,316 --> 00:47:50,097
place; he resisted the full force of the blow to
some physical damage himself, but not enough to

735
00:47:50,097 --> 00:47:53,538
knock the knee out. Do you want to move at all, or
are you going to stay where you are?

736
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:56,898
TRAVIS: I would like to move to flank his right
side.

737
00:47:56,898 --> 00:47:58,159
MATT: All righty.

738
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:00,128
SAM: Put him in a body bag!

739
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:04,577
MATT: As you move over, with that it comes to his
turn. As you're moving to the side, he spins

740
00:48:04,577 --> 00:48:09,736
around this time. You have not yet seen him move
his legs to this extent, to a full back roundhouse

741
00:48:09,736 --> 00:48:14,374
kick towards your head. That is going to be a 20?

742
00:48:14,374 --> 00:48:15,697
TRAVIS: That hits.

743
00:48:15,697 --> 00:48:19,303
MATT: That hits, okay. Second attack is going to
be a 19?

744
00:48:19,303 --> 00:48:20,445
TRAVIS: That hits.

745
00:48:20,445 --> 00:48:24,298
MATT: Next attack is going to be a 12, no, 13.

746
00:48:24,298 --> 00:48:25,406
TRAVIS: That misses.

747
00:48:25,406 --> 00:48:30,305
MATT: Okay. So the roundhouse kick (whoosh) swings
around, completely unexpected as you pull to the

748
00:48:30,305 --> 00:48:37,058
side. (smack) Hits you right square in the side of
the face and jaw. That is going to be seven points

749
00:48:37,058 --> 00:48:38,115
of damage.

750
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:39,120
TRAVIS: Okay.

751
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:43,603
MATT: And as you're reeling from that, he brings
the leg back, jumps in the air and does a

752
00:48:43,603 --> 00:48:49,349
secondary jump, side-swiping kick to the other
side of your head, as you're sent to the side.

753
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:54,299
(whack, whack) Second one doing eight points of
damage. (whack, whack)

754
00:48:54,299 --> 00:48:57,734
TRAVIS: Okay. All right.

755
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:05,623
MATT: And he's going to move slightly over here,
basically getting you up against the wall. He's

756
00:49:05,623 --> 00:49:09,607
situating himself now where since you moved to the
side; he's putting you in this pincer formation

757
00:49:09,607 --> 00:49:12,534
between the wall and himself. That ends his turn.
You're up.

758
00:49:12,534 --> 00:49:19,612
TRAVIS: (grunts, pants) I see you've been taking
some ballet. How very cultured of you. And I rush

759
00:49:19,612 --> 00:49:21,992
forward. I'm between him and the wall?

760
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:24,066
MATT: You are between him and the wall, yes.

761
00:49:24,066 --> 00:49:26,214
TRAVIS: Okay. (laughs)

762
00:49:26,214 --> 00:49:31,129
LAURA: I get up on Trinket's shoulders and cheer.

763
00:49:31,129 --> 00:49:36,381
MATT: (roars) Trinket roars with you. (roar) This
roar of victory, which people around immediately

764
00:49:36,381 --> 00:49:40,842
take two steps away from the large bear that's
suddenly roaring in the center. You guys are

765
00:49:40,842 --> 00:49:42,318
unfazed, too focused on each other.

766
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:47,989
TRAVIS: I rush up and get him, give him a little
nasty-- of the last time for a double thunderclap,

767
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:49,550
to either side of his ears.

768
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:51,006
MATT: Oof, okay.

769
00:49:51,006 --> 00:49:56,650
TRAVIS: That is a 13.

770
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:00,971
MATT: 13. Unfortunately, as you go to swing, he
(whoosh) ducks out of the way, and your hands slap

771
00:50:00,971 --> 00:50:03,401
into each other, finding no purchase on his head.

772
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:07,054
TRAVIS: That's all right. Since I didn't find any
purchase, I'll see where his ears are, try and

773
00:50:07,054 --> 00:50:13,209
grab them, and I'm going to attempt to rip his
ears off of his head. His nice pointy ears.

774
00:50:13,209 --> 00:50:17,159
MATT: Okay, so your second attack is going to be
to try and grab his ears. Go for it.

775
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:19,596
TRAVIS: 16.

776
00:50:19,596 --> 00:50:24,537
MATT: 16, no. As you go up for the one ear, he
parries it to the side with his hand.

777
00:50:24,537 --> 00:50:30,042
TRAVIS: (sighs) Third attack. 14.

778
00:50:30,042 --> 00:50:37,513
MATT: 14. (whoosh) Knocks that one out of the way.
As you're (whoosh, whoosh) swinging at him, he

779
00:50:37,513 --> 00:50:40,718
seems to just be dodging out of the way. He still
has the force behind him, but whatever he's picked

780
00:50:40,758 --> 00:50:43,840
up now has completely thrown you off. You weren't
prepared. You were prepared for a bruiser. You've

781
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,486
now seen, still a bruiser, but with a little more
refined technique, and it's throwing you off your

782
00:50:47,486 --> 00:50:51,822
game. You need to resettle yourself. You need to
pull yourself in, Grog. However, in that moment of

783
00:50:51,822 --> 00:51:02,250
thinking, he swings at you with a double pummel up
towards the torso. That is a natural 20. That is

784
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:03,556
going to be a 13.

785
00:51:03,556 --> 00:51:04,910
SAM: Oh! Miss.

786
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:11,194
MATT: This is yours, I believe. And that's going
to be a nine. (laughs) Or, sorry, a ten. So first

787
00:51:11,194 --> 00:51:15,256
one hits, second two miss. (whack) The first one
comes through and smacks you right in the center

788
00:51:15,256 --> 00:51:20,179
of the stomach. With a double hit, that's 14
points of damage.

789
00:51:20,179 --> 00:51:22,797
TRAVIS: I would like to use my Stone's Endurance.

790
00:51:22,797 --> 00:51:29,073
MATT: Go for it. You, at that point as the punch
hits your stomach, you flex, feeling the strength

791
00:51:29,073 --> 00:51:33,481
of the mountain fill your body, your ancestral
roots of your stone giant

792
00:51:33,481 --> 00:51:35,120
brethren fill your form.

793
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,146
TRAVIS: That's 16.

794
00:51:38,146 --> 00:51:44,562
MATT: 16. As the fist (crash) finds the side of
your stomach, the iron-like form that is your

795
00:51:44,562 --> 00:51:49,378
torso stops his fist in its place, and you see
him (pained exhale) pull away, shaking his hand.

796
00:51:49,422 --> 00:51:54,236
As he shakes away, he brings up his other hand to
backhand you. You duck out of the way. He swings

797
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:59,624
with a kick around with the momentum, and you
catch it in the middle of the air. So we're going

798
00:51:59,624 --> 00:52:02,440
to start your turn with you now holding his leg up
by the side of your head.

799
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:08,196
TRAVIS: Oh, fantastic. I'll keep that leg up in
the air. I'll move it over to my shoulder, take

800
00:52:08,196 --> 00:52:12,539
both my hands up and bring it down on top of his
kneecap, hyper-flexing the leg.

801
00:52:12,539 --> 00:52:14,171
(yelling)

802
00:52:14,171 --> 00:52:16,021
MATT: Go ahead and roll for attack on this.

803
00:52:16,021 --> 00:52:17,611
TRAVIS: That's better. 26.

804
00:52:17,611 --> 00:52:20,073
(cheering)

805
00:52:20,073 --> 00:52:23,777
TRAVIS: That's eight.

806
00:52:23,777 --> 00:52:25,395
MATT: Eight damage? All right.

807
00:52:25,395 --> 00:52:27,417
MARISHA: Maybe we can start a chant for
inspiration.

808
00:52:27,417 --> 00:52:29,248
LAURA: Yeah, can we? Grog.

809
00:52:29,248 --> 00:52:30,993
MATT: So that's your first attack?

810
00:52:30,993 --> 00:52:32,206
TRAVIS: That was my first.

811
00:52:32,206 --> 00:52:36,331
MATT: So as you go (crash), bring it down, the
knee-- a human's leg would have hyperextended, but

812
00:52:36,331 --> 00:52:41,229
the sheer size of muscle-- and this is comparable
to your own-- you feel it definitely hurt and he's

813
00:52:41,229 --> 00:52:44,930
like (pained cry) yelp out in pain, but it's not
enough to fully pop the leg back.

814
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:48,396
TRAVIS: What's the matter, ballerina? I thought
you should be stretched out and ready for this.

815
00:52:48,396 --> 00:52:51,383
And I reach back and I drive my fist into his
nutsack.

816
00:52:51,383 --> 00:52:53,158
(laughter)

817
00:52:53,158 --> 00:52:55,234
MATT: Roll a second attack.

818
00:52:55,234 --> 00:52:56,240
TRAVIS: 25.

819
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,472
MATT: That definitely hits. Go ahead and roll
damage on that.

820
00:52:58,472 --> 00:53:00,637
ORION: Oh my god, a Grog punch to the balls.

821
00:53:00,637 --> 00:53:02,106
TRAVIS: Eight. My first eight.

822
00:53:02,106 --> 00:53:04,796
MATT: Nice! Second eight, actually. You've already
rolled.

823
00:53:04,796 --> 00:53:05,979
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right, okay.

824
00:53:05,979 --> 00:53:09,398
ORION: I'm going to argue that that should be
doubled because there's two balls.

825
00:53:09,398 --> 00:53:11,343
(laughter)

826
00:53:11,343 --> 00:53:16,865
MATT: Kern is one of those individuals who's had
his nuts kicked enough times in his life to know

827
00:53:16,865 --> 00:53:21,511
the pain well and be prepared for it. So as you
come down, (whack) slam it right into him. You

828
00:53:21,511 --> 00:53:28,236
hear this (high, pained wail) almost wolf-like
screeching howl as Kern's head lifts up in severe

829
00:53:28,236 --> 00:53:33,282
pain. His hands come down and grasp your wrist and
is now holding it, trying to pull it away from his

830
00:53:33,282 --> 00:53:35,722
midsection. He's in a very bad situation right
now.

831
00:53:35,722 --> 00:53:41,238
TRAVIS: With that last one, can I take my right
leg and in an effort to shoot for that same knee

832
00:53:41,238 --> 00:53:43,766
I've been kicking at, aim for the knee or sweep
his feet?

833
00:53:43,766 --> 00:53:45,179
MATT: Sure, go for it.

834
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:48,493
TRAVIS: Fuck. That'll miss. It's a 13.

835
00:53:48,493 --> 00:53:53,253
MATT: 13. As you pull back to sweep, Kern uses
this advantage to bring up the other leg that you

836
00:53:53,253 --> 00:53:58,627
haven't hit, plant it right on your shoulder and
neck area, and then push off your body. As you

837
00:53:58,627 --> 00:54:02,970
sweep underneath, he leaps backward, flipping in
the air. (thud) Lands on both of his feet,

838
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:06,814
clutching the inside of his groin area, like
(snarling grunt) shaking off the pain through the

839
00:54:06,814 --> 00:54:10,402
anger. So he leaps back to here.

840
00:54:10,402 --> 00:54:13,188
MARISHA: As that's happening, we all start a
chant.

841
00:54:13,188 --> 00:54:18,157
ALL: (chanting) Grog, Grog, Grog.

842
00:54:18,157 --> 00:54:24,994
SAM: As they're chanting, I'm starting to sing
amid the chant. (singing) It's the eye of the

843
00:54:24,994 --> 00:54:34,036
goliath, it's the thrill of the fight. Rising up
to the challenge of that asshole. (speaking) And

844
00:54:34,036 --> 00:54:36,451
I'm trying to send inspiration to him.

845
00:54:36,451 --> 00:54:41,295
MATT: With that, you hear through the fury,
through the anger that the chant, your real name,

846
00:54:41,295 --> 00:54:46,664
not Philip now, your real name, reclaimed in the
center of this proving point in the center of the

847
00:54:46,664 --> 00:54:52,789
oldest known city to civilization, under the
visual guidance of the god of strength and valor.

848
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:59,592
And through all that, you hear the gentle hymn of
Scanlan's voice cut through all that and come to

849
00:54:59,592 --> 00:55:04,648
you with a beat, a rhythmic beat that drives you
forward. Go ahead and take a d10 inspiration.

850
00:55:04,648 --> 00:55:06,417
(cheering)

851
00:55:06,417 --> 00:55:15,294
MATT: Now Kern, having landed on his feet, rushes
forward towards you, and first using his bonus

852
00:55:15,294 --> 00:55:19,223
action, is going to go ahead and reach down for a
very deep uppercut. It looks like he's coming in

853
00:55:19,223 --> 00:55:24,639
for a left, and sweeps down to try and take you from
underneath, breaking through your defense. That is going

854
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:25,641
to be a 20.

855
00:55:25,641 --> 00:55:26,795
TRAVIS: That hits.

856
00:55:26,795 --> 00:55:33,658
MATT: You take ten points of damage. Right to the
chin from underneath. For the bonus action, Kern

857
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:38,992
then comes back, and you're used to an unleashed
flurry. Kern, however, comes back into a fully

858
00:55:38,992 --> 00:55:43,784
defensive position, righting his hands and leg in
a backwards stance, and is just looking at you,

859
00:55:43,784 --> 00:55:48,176
ready for you to come. He's using his action to go
into a dodge. It's now your turn.

860
00:55:48,176 --> 00:55:50,511
SAM: Oh, wait, so he gets some sort of advantage?

861
00:55:50,511 --> 00:55:52,843
MATT: All attacks against him have disadvantage
this next turn.

862
00:55:52,843 --> 00:56:00,036
ORION: Wait, against him? No, he meant...
advantage, because balls.

863
00:56:00,036 --> 00:56:00,959
MATT: Nope.

864
00:56:00,959 --> 00:56:02,005
ORION: Damn it.

865
00:56:02,005 --> 00:56:03,561
MARISHA: The balls doesn't give advantage?

866
00:56:03,561 --> 00:56:04,894
ORION: No, he has tough nuts. Never mind.

867
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:09,760
MATT: He has the feat Toughness, which I think
really resists any sort of

868
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,033
ball damage at this point.

869
00:56:11,033 --> 00:56:20,303
TRAVIS: In an effort to keep my distance, I run
towards him, I jump up in the air and throw one

870
00:56:20,303 --> 00:56:23,877
thrust-kick towards the side, right towards his
chest, just to see what his defense will do.

871
00:56:23,919 --> 00:56:27,616
MATT: Go for it. With disadvantage, so roll
twice.

872
00:56:27,616 --> 00:56:33,001
LAURA: Oh god. Mother bitch!

873
00:56:33,001 --> 00:56:36,207
TRAVIS: Well, that was a natural 20, but 19.

874
00:56:36,207 --> 00:56:37,972
MATT: 19. Total 19?

875
00:56:37,972 --> 00:56:38,965
TRAVIS: Total 19.

876
00:56:38,965 --> 00:56:40,463
MATT: That just barely hits.

877
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:49,946
TRAVIS: Can I add the inspiration to the-- no,
just to the roll, right. That is an eight.

878
00:56:49,946 --> 00:56:51,848
MATT: Eight. So.

879
00:56:51,848 --> 00:56:55,426
TRAVIS: Halved. So half of three is one and a
half, and we're rounding up?

880
00:56:55,426 --> 00:56:57,826
MATT: Rounding up, yeah. Three and four is a two,
considered.

881
00:56:57,826 --> 00:56:59,059
TRAVIS: Right, so eight.

882
00:56:59,059 --> 00:57:04,671
MATT: All righty. All right. So you rush up,
(whack) slamming. He puts the defense out and

883
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:08,810
tries to push to the side. However, his defense is
imperfect; you can see he's still new to this

884
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:14,120
fighting style, and you still manage to push
through with sheer force and slam into the side of

885
00:57:14,173 --> 00:57:15,996
his torso from the impact.

886
00:57:15,996 --> 00:57:19,751
TRAVIS: I leap forward again and try to throw my
thumbs into his eyes.

887
00:57:19,751 --> 00:57:24,014
MATT: Okay, you're going for the blind again. Go
ahead and roll an attack on this, with

888
00:57:24,014 --> 00:57:25,015
disadvantage.

889
00:57:25,015 --> 00:57:27,972
TRAVIS: 21-- aw. 15.

890
00:57:27,972 --> 00:57:28,826
MATT: 15.

891
00:57:28,826 --> 00:57:30,360
ORION: Inspiration!

892
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,943
SAM: If you want to use it.

893
00:57:32,943 --> 00:57:35,376
TRAVIS: That's a 22.

894
00:57:35,376 --> 00:57:36,293
MATT: 22 hits.

895
00:57:36,293 --> 00:57:37,752
(cheering)

896
00:57:37,752 --> 00:57:44,365
MATT: So you rush forward to grab. You have hold
of his head now. There's no damage this round, but

897
00:57:44,365 --> 00:57:49,159
you're enabling yourself now for the rest of the
round to attempt to push into his eyes. There's no

898
00:57:49,159 --> 00:57:53,220
damage on this one. You grab the side of his head,
and you see his eyes open with this look of fear

899
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:58,111
at the unexpected ferocity from you. Go ahead and
make an athletics check.

900
00:57:58,111 --> 00:57:59,791
MARISHA: Come on, Grog!

901
00:57:59,791 --> 00:58:02,128
TRAVIS: 24.

902
00:58:02,128 --> 00:58:07,588
MATT: 24. He rolled a 19, so go ahead and do
damage on this. Roll damage.

903
00:58:07,588 --> 00:58:15,283
TRAVIS: With the four? Six.

904
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:21,371
MATT: Six, all righty. So as you have a hold of
his head, you grin as your thumbs push into his

905
00:58:21,371 --> 00:58:29,345
eyes. He yells out in pain, and before you can
damage the eyes permanently, he slaps off of your

906
00:58:29,345 --> 00:58:34,348
hands so hard and with such an intense push that
you can't help but feel your actual forearms be

907
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:38,947
blown back. However, he's clutching the side of
his face, and for the next round, he is blinded.

908
00:58:38,947 --> 00:58:41,789
TRAVIS: Can I move?

909
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:43,040
MATT: You can move, as well.

910
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,402
TRAVIS: I just back straight up.

911
00:58:44,402 --> 00:58:49,005
MATT: Back this way? He currently doesn't threaten
you because he's blinded, so you can rush past him

912
00:58:49,005 --> 00:58:50,599
and not get an attack of opportunity.

913
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:51,445
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

914
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:52,250
MATT: Yeah.

915
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:54,386
TRAVIS: I'll move along the wall to his left
side.

916
00:58:54,386 --> 00:58:55,365
MATT: Over here?

917
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,205
TRAVIS: Yes.

918
00:58:56,205 --> 00:58:57,165
MATT: To there?

919
00:58:57,165 --> 00:58:58,022
TRAVIS: Yes.

920
00:58:58,022 --> 00:58:58,767
MATT: Okay.

921
00:58:58,767 --> 00:58:59,800
LAURA: But back up?

922
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,351
TRAVIS: And back up just a little bit. Yeah.

923
00:59:01,351 --> 00:59:12,428
MATT: Okay. So. As you dodge off to the side,
Kern's grabbing his face, and just takes a moment.

924
00:59:12,428 --> 00:59:19,194
Hears your footsteps along the side, as there is
no stealth to this; there are just footprints.

925
00:59:19,194 --> 00:59:24,526
However, Kern does attempt to sidestep over. He's
going to attempt to make three strikes at you,

926
00:59:24,526 --> 00:59:27,297
with a disadvantage on all of them because he's
currently blinded.

927
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:30,668
TRAVIS: All right, you seem to be rolling pretty
high. You could use the dice that I threw.

928
00:59:30,668 --> 00:59:37,800
MATT: And rolls against him have advantage as
well. All right, so attacks against you. That is

929
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,397
going to be a 14.

930
00:59:39,397 --> 00:59:40,729
TRAVIS: Misses!

931
00:59:40,729 --> 00:59:45,850
MATT: Natural 20 or an eight. So that'll be 16.

932
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:47,132
TRAVIS: Okay, that misses.

933
00:59:47,132 --> 00:59:58,749
MATT: 19 and 19. Another one does hit. So, wide
punches forward. They're a foot away from you. You

934
00:59:58,749 --> 01:00:03,546
chuckle, getting out of the way, and as you
chuckle, he hears that. (snap) And for a moment,

935
01:00:03,546 --> 01:00:06,557
his mind clarifies, even though his eyes are
closed with a trickle of blood off the side of one

936
01:00:06,557 --> 01:00:11,875
of the eye. He immediately goes into a
faster-than-you-expected midsection punch that

937
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:15,946
(whack) smacks you right in the middle of your
laughing stomach. Because you're laughing, there

938
01:00:16,076 --> 01:00:20,854
is that tension, but it wasn't flexed, prepared
for an actual impact from a fist. And you take

939
01:00:20,854 --> 01:00:25,007
seven points of damage from the hit to your
abdomen.

940
01:00:25,007 --> 01:00:27,426
TRAVIS: All right.

941
01:00:27,426 --> 01:00:30,801
MATT: It is your turn. He is still blinded, so you
have advantage on all these attacks. As you reel

942
01:00:30,801 --> 01:00:32,177
from the hit to your midsection--

943
01:00:32,177 --> 01:00:37,569
TRAVIS: I want to move-- no, I'll stay right where
I am. Can I reach forward, grab his head and his

944
01:00:37,715 --> 01:00:40,027
shoulder, and go in for a bite attack at his
neck?

945
01:00:40,027 --> 01:00:41,257
MATT: You certainly can.

946
01:00:41,257 --> 01:00:46,727
TRAVIS: (growls) Yes! Aiming for the jugular. 23.

947
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:50,137
MATT: 23? Definitely hits. Go ahead and roll
damage on that.

948
01:00:50,137 --> 01:00:53,322
TRAVIS: All right. Eight.

949
01:00:53,322 --> 01:00:54,967
SAM: You're sure you're adding that right?

950
01:00:54,967 --> 01:00:55,714
TRAVIS: Yeah.

951
01:00:55,714 --> 01:00:56,880
SAM: It's just plus four?

952
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,934
TRAVIS: Plus six. This is halved.

953
01:00:58,934 --> 01:01:02,058
SAM: Are you sure? I thought you were both raging.
There's no halves!

954
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:03,268
TRAVIS: No, we halve the die.

955
01:01:03,268 --> 01:01:05,464
SAM: Is that true?

956
01:01:05,464 --> 01:01:10,346
MATT: Both of them are at half damage because of
their raging, so we're considering them both to

957
01:01:10,346 --> 01:01:11,268
not count that.

958
01:01:11,268 --> 01:01:13,261
SAM: So they're not counting the halves?

959
01:01:13,261 --> 01:01:14,709
LAURA: So he shouldn't be halving his die?

960
01:01:14,709 --> 01:01:21,395
MATT: Well, no. The die halving is the natural
damage of a punch, 1d2. So it's half of a d4.

961
01:01:21,395 --> 01:01:22,887
LAURA: Got it. Sorry.

962
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:28,042
MATT: Except for Kern, who is currently doing a
full d4 on his punches. For some reason! (laughs)

963
01:01:28,042 --> 01:01:39,356
All right. So. As you rush in, he puts out a hand
to try and punch instinctively as you rush towards

964
01:01:39,356 --> 01:01:44,347
him, his eyes still coated in his own blood. You
push to the side, reach in, and grab the back of

965
01:01:44,347 --> 01:01:48,539
his shoulder, and (crunching sound) Grog-bite into
the side. It's like biting into a tree trunk, his

966
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:49,835
skin is so thick.

967
01:01:49,835 --> 01:01:51,531
TRAVIS: I eat bar stools for dinner.

968
01:01:51,531 --> 01:01:58,650
MATT: You do, actually, and the taste is similar,
Your teeth grind in, and you find yourself tearing

969
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:02,716
into probably what would be the toughest steak
you've ever tried. You get about a quarter to a

970
01:02:02,753 --> 01:02:06,035
half an inch in with your teeth, definitely taking
a chunk and (tearing sound) tearing out what you

971
01:02:06,035 --> 01:02:12,132
can, but based on the general hardiness of his
half-orc structure, you don't get to a jugular or

972
01:02:12,132 --> 01:02:17,253
any major vein, but you do leave a gash that
leaves a significant mark on his body. That's the

973
01:02:17,253 --> 01:02:18,099
first attack.

974
01:02:18,099 --> 01:02:21,304
TRAVIS: I pull back from the bite, and I whisper
into his ear, I was wondering what was going to

975
01:02:21,356 --> 01:02:28,053
break first: your spirit, or your body. And I
would like to try to pick him up over my head and

976
01:02:28,053 --> 01:02:30,189
bring him down on my knee, Bane-style.

977
01:02:30,189 --> 01:02:31,563
LAURA: Batman!

978
01:02:31,563 --> 01:02:37,584
MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check. With
advantage.

979
01:02:37,584 --> 01:02:40,939
TRAVIS: Okay, that's 25.

980
01:02:40,939 --> 01:02:42,115
MATT: 25.

981
01:02:42,115 --> 01:02:47,393
TRAVIS: Do I need to roll on advantage to see if I
get a 20?

982
01:02:47,523 --> 01:02:48,623
MATT: Sure, go for it.

983
01:02:48,623 --> 01:02:50,339
TRAVIS: Oh, it's a 19. It was so close! 26.

984
01:02:50,339 --> 01:02:51,504
MATT: 26.

985
01:02:51,504 --> 01:02:52,830
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch!

986
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:57,932
MATT: You reach forward and scoop him up, lifting
him over your head. He's trying to resist it, but

987
01:02:57,932 --> 01:03:04,307
in his unable-to-see state, there's no way he can
possibly resist this. You lift him up over the

988
01:03:04,307 --> 01:03:12,088
top, (whack) down onto the knee. Go ahead and roll
damage. I will consider both your two final

989
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:14,966
attacks, but this attack damage is doubled,
modifier included.

990
01:03:14,966 --> 01:03:16,314
TRAVIS: Seven, so 14.

991
01:03:16,314 --> 01:03:18,616
(cheering)

992
01:03:18,616 --> 01:03:28,574
MATT: All right. As part of this, he is--

993
01:03:28,574 --> 01:03:30,279
SAM: Oh no. He's going to pull some shit.

994
01:03:30,279 --> 01:03:33,047
TRAVIS: Matt reaching for things is never good.

995
01:03:33,047 --> 01:03:36,669
MATT: I'm going to go ahead and make a
constitution check on his end. The DC is going to

996
01:03:36,669 --> 01:03:45,108
be the damage dealt, so he's going to try and
essentially resist the effect of this. He is at

997
01:03:45,108 --> 01:03:53,768
disadvantage because he's blinded. That is a
three. An 18 and a three. However, he still has a

998
01:03:53,768 --> 01:03:57,019
high constitution and so that's still plus 9 to
that.

999
01:03:57,019 --> 01:03:58,774
TALIESIN, TRAVIS, and LAURA: 12.

1000
01:03:58,774 --> 01:04:05,136
MATT: Not enough to beat the 14. So, for the
purposes of this round, Kern is currently on the

1001
01:04:05,136 --> 01:04:07,596
ground, stunned. He loses an entire round of
combat.

1002
01:04:07,596 --> 01:04:09,623
(excited noises)

1003
01:04:09,623 --> 01:04:19,322
MATT: No longer blinded, but Kern is currently
(choking noises) reaching towards his back, where

1004
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:23,315
there's this shooting pain throughout his entire
nervous system. You have another round to go.

1005
01:04:23,315 --> 01:04:31,034
TRAVIS: I reach up with my fingernails, and I
carve these scrapes down my face, and I leap up

1006
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:33,492
with both feet, and I jump down on his head.

1007
01:04:33,492 --> 01:04:35,338
(yelling)

1008
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:37,686
LAURA: It's so brutal!

1009
01:04:37,686 --> 01:04:40,604
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll. Attacks have
advantage on him because he's stunned.

1010
01:04:40,604 --> 01:04:43,203
TRAVIS: That's better. 23.

1011
01:04:43,203 --> 01:04:44,343
MATT: 23 hits.

1012
01:04:44,343 --> 01:04:49,447
TRAVIS: You know what? Just three of them. (battle
cry)

1013
01:04:49,447 --> 01:04:53,680
MATT: Just rage-stomping on him? Okay! Three
attacks.

1014
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:56,255
TRAVIS: 20.

1015
01:04:56,255 --> 01:04:57,485
MATT: 20 hits.

1016
01:04:57,485 --> 01:05:00,036
MARISHA: You're right. This is so much more
exciting when you bet.

1017
01:05:00,036 --> 01:05:01,143
TRAVIS: 15.

1018
01:05:01,143 --> 01:05:09,212
MATT: The first, you leap up into the air, both
feet down (wham) right into the shoulder and side

1019
01:05:09,212 --> 01:05:12,812
of the rib cage. You hear a (wet crunching noise)
snap as at least two ribs give way under the sheer

1020
01:05:12,812 --> 01:05:18,761
weight and force of your left foot. As you leap up
again, bring down both feet a second time, one

1021
01:05:18,761 --> 01:05:23,229
finds purchase on the ground next to him, while
the second one hits him right in the lower

1022
01:05:23,229 --> 01:05:29,751
abdomen, pelvis region. (whack) With this second
one, you hear (deep groaning) the scream as the

1023
01:05:29,751 --> 01:05:34,581
air is nearly knocked out of Kern. The third one,
you reach up, this time just seeing seething rage.

1024
01:05:34,581 --> 01:05:38,342
You can feel the actual foam at the corners of
your mouth dripping down the sides of your chin.

1025
01:05:38,342 --> 01:05:43,624
As you bring your leg up again to stomp a third
time, this time Kern rolls out of the way. He

1026
01:05:43,624 --> 01:05:46,241
manages to just avoid the third slam. What's the
total damage on that?

1027
01:05:46,241 --> 01:05:53,048
TRAVIS: Did I roll? It's good. Eight and eight!

1028
01:05:53,048 --> 01:05:54,318
MATT: Damn!

1029
01:05:54,318 --> 01:06:03,171
TALIESIN: You turned him into a stain.

1030
01:06:03,171 --> 01:06:11,364
MATT: Kern, no longer stunned, now gets up,
(grunts) holding the back of his side.

1031
01:06:11,364 --> 01:06:13,583
LAURA: You suck, Kern!

1032
01:06:13,583 --> 01:06:15,503
ORION: You also smell!

1033
01:06:15,503 --> 01:06:21,639
MATT: (chuckles) Glances up for a moment at you,
and sees you raising your fists and gives a grin.

1034
01:06:21,639 --> 01:06:29,907
Looks back towards you and lunges towards you now.
He's going to attempt a grapple at you. Go ahead and

1035
01:06:29,907 --> 01:06:32,364
make an athletics check.

1036
01:06:32,364 --> 01:06:34,952
TRAVIS: That's a one.

1037
01:06:34,952 --> 01:06:36,694
LAURA: Do you get an advantage at all?

1038
01:06:36,694 --> 01:06:45,985
MATT: Nope, no longer blinded, no longer stunned.
You are considered currently grappled. All right,

1039
01:06:45,985 --> 01:06:55,685
so for the action there-- as a bonus action he's
going to rear back, open his mouth, and attempt to

1040
01:06:55,685 --> 01:06:57,297
bite towards your face.

1041
01:06:57,297 --> 01:06:58,656
MARISHA: He's Mike Tyson-ing you.

1042
01:06:58,656 --> 01:07:03,787
MATT: Correct. That is a 21.

1043
01:07:03,787 --> 01:07:05,072
TRAVIS: That hits.

1044
01:07:05,072 --> 01:07:17,073
MATT: You take ten points of damage, and you feel
teeth grasp on to the top of your lip, and with a

1045
01:07:17,073 --> 01:07:22,327
sickening sharp, burning sensation, (wet ripping
noise) your upper lip is now torn from the front

1046
01:07:22,327 --> 01:07:28,126
of your face. As you see Kern reel back, a streak
of blood spilling off in an arc as his head pulls

1047
01:07:28,126 --> 01:07:36,020
back, a terrible grin creeping across his smile.
As you now see, this dull gray-colored, Grog

1048
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:40,064
flesh-toned piece of skin dangling bloodily from
his mouth.

1049
01:07:40,064 --> 01:07:44,694
(disgusted noises)

1050
01:07:44,694 --> 01:07:46,919
MARISHA: We can fix it!

1051
01:07:46,919 --> 01:07:49,656
MATT: Your turn, currently grappled so you can't
move.

1052
01:07:49,656 --> 01:07:52,162
TRAVIS: I would like to attempt to break that grapple.

1053
01:07:52,162 --> 01:07:54,454
MATT: Okay. Make an athletics check.

1054
01:07:54,454 --> 01:07:58,983
TRAVIS: That is 21.

1055
01:07:58,983 --> 01:08:02,597
MATT: He rolled a 14. So you break from the
grapple. Still have your bonus action.

1056
01:08:02,597 --> 01:08:04,691
TRAVIS: Both of my bonus actions, or all three?

1057
01:08:04,691 --> 01:08:12,585
MATT: Actually, breaking from grapple-- let me
double-check. It uses an action, so yeah, it's

1058
01:08:12,585 --> 01:08:15,198
your action. You still have a bonus action.

1059
01:08:15,198 --> 01:08:24,501
TRAVIS: I blow through my newly lipless mouth,
(laughs) and I run up and

1060
01:08:24,501 --> 01:08:26,070
I throw my face into his.

1061
01:08:26,070 --> 01:08:28,931
MATT: Okay! Go ahead and roll for your headbutt.

1062
01:08:28,931 --> 01:08:31,132
TRAVIS: That's a 17.

1063
01:08:31,132 --> 01:08:38,657
MATT: 17 misses. As you dodge forward, Kern
actually spits it toward you and it (squelch) hits

1064
01:08:38,657 --> 01:08:43,843
you in the face, and for a second, it completely
throws you off. Your head still goes forward.

1065
01:08:43,843 --> 01:08:49,832
However, as you look down, Kern has already
swished beneath you. The sheer speed is

1066
01:08:49,832 --> 01:08:56,572
unexpected; he's now beneath looking up and grabs
the chunk of the lip that he had taken and comes

1067
01:08:56,572 --> 01:08:58,168
up for a full round of attacks against you.

1068
01:08:58,168 --> 01:08:59,666
TRAVIS: Wait, that was just my one attack.

1069
01:08:59,666 --> 01:09:04,155
MATT: Oh, that's right. You still have-- No, you
used your action to break the grapple. So you're

1070
01:09:04,155 --> 01:09:06,204
still grappled, so you can't move. So this
is his turn.

1071
01:09:06,257 --> 01:09:07,515
TRAVIS: I broke the grapple!

1072
01:09:07,515 --> 01:09:10,117
MATT: You did break the grapple, so yeah, you
could still move if you wanted to.

1073
01:09:10,117 --> 01:09:12,100
TRAVIS: No, I'll stay there.

1074
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:15,484
MATT: Okay. That is a 23.

1075
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:16,526
TRAVIS: Hits.

1076
01:09:16,526 --> 01:09:20,636
MATT: 23. And a 12.

1077
01:09:20,636 --> 01:09:22,343
TRAVIS: (sighs) Misses.

1078
01:09:22,343 --> 01:09:27,061
MATT: So, grabs the lip in one hand, reaches up
and then (slam) uppercuts you from underneath for

1079
01:09:27,061 --> 01:09:30,250
the first hit. That is seven points of damage.

1080
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:31,409
TRAVIS: Okay.

1081
01:09:31,409 --> 01:09:36,328
MATT: The next one, however, is eight points of
damage. Swings up and actually haymakers you to

1082
01:09:36,328 --> 01:09:40,848
the side with the hand still holding the chunk of
your lip in it (slamming impact) across the side

1083
01:09:40,848 --> 01:09:50,170
of your face, and is going to attempt to do a
backwards leaping flip-kick. However, because Kern

1084
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:54,762
is not as practiced at this and is over-extending,
you see it telegraphed far in advance, and you

1085
01:09:54,762 --> 01:09:58,766
duck out of the way, and it (whoosh) whiffs past.
Kern loses his balance for a minute and in an

1086
01:09:58,766 --> 01:10:02,101
embarrassing moment almost falls over from his own
strike. Manages to catch himself and is like,

1087
01:10:02,101 --> 01:10:07,440
"Nobody saw that, right?" That ends Kern's turn.
You're up.

1088
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,318
LAURA: (shouting) I saw that, Kern!

1089
01:10:09,318 --> 01:10:12,372
TRAVIS: I reach forward, throw that leg towards
the right knee again.

1090
01:10:12,372 --> 01:10:13,656
Still working on the same spot.

1091
01:10:13,656 --> 01:10:15,310
MATT: Okay.

1092
01:10:15,488 --> 01:10:16,469
TRAVIS: Miss.

1093
01:10:16,469 --> 01:10:19,315
MATT: All right. Still have two more strikes.

1094
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:22,608
TRAVIS: That's a 21.

1095
01:10:22,608 --> 01:10:24,368
MATT: 21 hits.

1096
01:10:24,368 --> 01:10:29,863
TRAVIS: And I miss.

1097
01:10:29,863 --> 01:10:35,592
MATT: Okay. So, you rush forward with your leg
(whoomph) he manages to duck out of the way,

1098
01:10:35,592 --> 01:10:40,377
bringing his knee up to the side. Comes down to
try and get ready for the next attack; however,

1099
01:10:40,377 --> 01:10:43,804
you already used that inertia of the kick to bring
your fist down (whack) right across the front of

1100
01:10:43,804 --> 01:10:45,696
his face. Go ahead and roll damage.

1101
01:10:45,696 --> 01:10:46,921
TRAVIS: That's an eight.

1102
01:10:46,921 --> 01:10:53,456
MATT: Eight. All right. Okay, and the third
strike, you come out to follow that up with a full

1103
01:10:53,456 --> 01:10:56,787
combo, at which point however, he reaches out,
(clutching noise) grabs the sides of your wrists

1104
01:10:56,787 --> 01:11:02,006
with both of his hands and brings it down to where
you're now face-to-face again, left at his mercy

1105
01:11:02,006 --> 01:11:07,044
at this point. You're off-balance and led towards
him. It's Kern's turn. Kern is going to reach back

1106
01:11:07,044 --> 01:11:10,686
and attempt to headbutt you in the front. That is
a 21.

1107
01:11:10,686 --> 01:11:11,809
TRAVIS: That hits.

1108
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:15,336
MATT: That is an 11.

1109
01:11:15,336 --> 01:11:16,513
TRAVIS: Misses.

1110
01:11:16,513 --> 01:11:18,054
MATT: And that's going to be a 22.

1111
01:11:18,054 --> 01:11:19,144
TRAVIS: That hits.

1112
01:11:19,144 --> 01:11:24,735
MATT: Just (whack) headbutts you right square in
the face. You reel back from it. He goes to

1113
01:11:24,735 --> 01:11:29,159
headbutt again. This time you duck out of the way.
However, at that point, he pulls you closer in

1114
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:33,017
towards him, still holding your wrists to his
side, and he headbutts you a third time. So, the

1115
01:11:33,017 --> 01:11:38,874
first headbutt does nine points of damage, and the
other one does seven points of damage.

1116
01:11:38,874 --> 01:11:40,169
TRAVIS: Okay.

1117
01:11:40,169 --> 01:11:46,406
MATT: (whack, whoosh, whack) Pulling you in, this
time releasing you from the sheer impact, pushing

1118
01:11:46,406 --> 01:11:48,892
you back onto your feet. It's your go.

1119
01:11:48,892 --> 01:11:50,357
TRAVIS: Am I back to the wall?

1120
01:11:50,357 --> 01:11:51,986
MATT: You're pretty close to the wall, yeah.

1121
01:11:51,986 --> 01:11:56,042
TRAVIS: I'd like to take a step back, put my back
foot on the wall, and then push off into the air

1122
01:11:56,042 --> 01:11:57,789
with a huge overhand right.

1123
01:11:57,789 --> 01:12:01,671
MATT: Nice! Okay, pushing off in the air and
arcing down with the fist.

1124
01:12:01,671 --> 01:12:03,898
TRAVIS: That's a 22.

1125
01:12:03,898 --> 01:12:04,741
MATT: 22 hits.

1126
01:12:04,741 --> 01:12:07,592
TRAVIS: Eight points of damage.

1127
01:12:07,592 --> 01:12:10,100
MATT: Eight points of damage. All righty.

1128
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:15,549
TRAVIS: And then I say, you were supposed to be
the only lipless one. And I soccer ball the shit

1129
01:12:15,549 --> 01:12:18,553
out of those dimes between his legs.

1130
01:12:18,553 --> 01:12:20,185
(laughter)

1131
01:12:20,185 --> 01:12:21,598
TRAVIS: Nice! 25.

1132
01:12:21,598 --> 01:12:23,776
MATT: 25, that definitely hits.

1133
01:12:23,776 --> 01:12:25,445
TRAVIS: That is seven.

1134
01:12:25,445 --> 01:12:34,317
MATT: All righty. (whack) With another screeching
(howls in pain) your foot immediately cracks

1135
01:12:34,317 --> 01:12:42,583
right. You've now repeatedly pummeled him into his
man-bits, and you can see there is a dark stain in

1136
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:46,475
his trousers when you pull your foot back. You've
definitely drawn blood in his nether regions.

1137
01:12:46,514 --> 01:12:50,428
LAURA: Oh, Kord. That is painful.

1138
01:12:50,428 --> 01:12:53,117
TRAVIS: Is he still standing? Is he bent over?

1139
01:12:53,117 --> 01:12:57,176
MATT: He's standing partially bent forward,
clutching towards the severe pain in his nether

1140
01:12:57,176 --> 01:12:58,146
regions.

1141
01:12:58,146 --> 01:13:01,865
TRAVIS: What? Did you lose something? No? You'll
lose it now. And I do it again.

1142
01:13:01,865 --> 01:13:03,154
MATT: All right.

1143
01:13:03,154 --> 01:13:04,635
TRAVIS: 19.

1144
01:13:04,635 --> 01:13:05,936
MATT: 19 just barely hits.

1145
01:13:05,936 --> 01:13:07,695
(cheering)

1146
01:13:07,695 --> 01:13:08,828
TRAVIS: Eight!

1147
01:13:08,828 --> 01:13:10,159
MATT: Eight. All righty.

1148
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:11,629
TRAVIS: Thank you, Percy.

1149
01:13:11,629 --> 01:13:21,672
MATT: (whack) A third hit. This time (guttural
cry) another howl in pain. Kern reaches down and

1150
01:13:21,672 --> 01:13:25,622
clasps his hands once again, the same capture
maneuver he did with your fist, onto your ankle,

1151
01:13:25,622 --> 01:13:31,192
and you can see the face goes from pain and his
eyes flash open with a blood-seething orc rage.

1152
01:13:31,192 --> 01:13:35,479
Half-orc this may be; in this moment, Kern's gone
full orc.

1153
01:13:35,479 --> 01:13:36,611
TRAVIS: Okay.

1154
01:13:36,611 --> 01:13:42,182
MATT: And you can see (growls) on his turn, Kern
is going to, pulling your leg forward towards you.

1155
01:13:42,182 --> 01:13:46,513
You feel yourself pulled off balance, and the
momentum pull you towards him as he unleashes

1156
01:13:46,513 --> 01:13:47,931
another flurry of blows against you.

1157
01:13:47,931 --> 01:13:52,413
SAM: As he does, I shout out from the audience
using my Cutting Words.

1158
01:13:52,413 --> 01:13:54,063
MATT: What do you shout?

1159
01:13:54,063 --> 01:13:58,607
SAM: Oh, Kern, do you need some dick? Because I
gave some to your mom last night!

1160
01:13:58,607 --> 01:14:03,067
(laughing and jeering)

1161
01:14:03,067 --> 01:14:05,141
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d10, and I'll subtract
it from his attack roll.

1162
01:14:05,141 --> 01:14:06,141
SAM: d10?

1163
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:07,719
ORION: That was a burn.

1164
01:14:07,719 --> 01:14:09,387
SAM: Fuck! Only three.

1165
01:14:09,387 --> 01:14:15,393
MATT: That's okay. So, his roll was a 21, that
brings it down to an 18. What's your armor class?

1166
01:14:15,393 --> 01:14:16,539
TRAVIS: It's 18.

1167
01:14:16,539 --> 01:14:17,673
MATT: 18, so it still hits.

1168
01:14:17,673 --> 01:14:19,769
(dismayed shouting)

1169
01:14:19,769 --> 01:14:24,003
MATT: Still, that was awesome! You can see there's
a momentary distraction as Kern glances over for a

1170
01:14:24,003 --> 01:14:28,517
second angrily, but still follows through with the
first hit, this one clocking you straight in the

1171
01:14:28,517 --> 01:14:36,685
face, sending your head back in severe pain. You
take ten points of damage. (whack) You fall

1172
01:14:36,685 --> 01:14:45,783
backward, the force of the blow sending you onto
your heels. Second strike comes in at a 15. I

1173
01:14:45,783 --> 01:14:46,791
believe that misses.

1174
01:14:46,791 --> 01:14:48,131
TRAVIS: Oh, that misses. Yeah, sorry.

1175
01:14:48,131 --> 01:14:56,410
MATT: That is-- oh, that's a natural 20. That puts
it at 12 points of damage on the third strike. As

1176
01:14:56,410 --> 01:15:01,805
Kern comes forward, the second punch swings over
your head as you're still reeled back. The third

1177
01:15:01,805 --> 01:15:07,049
one, he runs forward towards you as you're pushed
a few feet away and knees you right straight to

1178
01:15:07,049 --> 01:15:12,525
the solar plexus, (gasps) the impact causing the
air to escape your lungs, and for a brief moment

1179
01:15:12,525 --> 01:15:15,972
you're (gasping) having to pull the air back in.
It's your turn.

1180
01:15:15,972 --> 01:15:16,909
TRAVIS: Right.

1181
01:15:16,909 --> 01:15:22,496
MARISHA: So, is that-- I was just saying, if we
get another chant going--

1182
01:15:22,496 --> 01:15:25,378
ALL: (chanting) Grog, Grog, Grog.

1183
01:15:25,378 --> 01:15:30,231
MARISHA: Cover me. I cast Healing Word on Grog.

1184
01:15:30,231 --> 01:15:34,600
MATT: All right, I'm going to ask you to do a
sleight-of-hand check.

1185
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:38,155
MARISHA: Okay. Do I get advantage because we're
all chanting together?

1186
01:15:38,155 --> 01:15:40,105
MATT: Nope.

1187
01:15:40,105 --> 01:15:42,350
ORION: What if I shot off a Prestidigitation
firework?

1188
01:15:42,350 --> 01:15:43,440
LAURA: Nope.

1189
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:46,736
MARISHA: To help me out? Will it be a team
effort? No? All right.

1190
01:15:46,786 --> 01:15:47,970
MATT: Doing this now.

1191
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:52,710
MARISHA: Oh, that's good, that's a 16. 18 total.

1192
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:59,947
MATT: (chuckles) As you begin casting, one of the
Bastions grabs your wrist and pulls you into his

1193
01:15:59,947 --> 01:16:04,731
face and says, "I'm sorry, missy. Am I to
understand that you're cheating?"

1194
01:16:04,731 --> 01:16:08,445
MARSHA: No! That's just the language of my
people.

1195
01:16:08,445 --> 01:16:09,666
ORION: She's foreign.

1196
01:16:09,666 --> 01:16:10,979
MARISHA: Yes, I'm foreign.

1197
01:16:10,979 --> 01:16:14,916
MATT: Go ahead and make a deception roll. It would
be with disadvantage, but because Tiberius is

1198
01:16:14,916 --> 01:16:17,453
helping you, we're just gonna make it
a straight roll.

1199
01:16:17,478 --> 01:16:21,817
MARISHA: Deception?

1200
01:16:21,817 --> 01:16:23,275
MATT: Deception.

1201
01:16:23,275 --> 01:16:26,012
MARISHA: 11 total, because charisma.

1202
01:16:26,012 --> 01:16:28,560
MATT: The Bastion says, "You're coming with me."

1203
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:32,036
MARISHA: Why do I always get busted?

1204
01:16:32,036 --> 01:16:36,617
ORION: Can I do something real quick?

1205
01:16:36,617 --> 01:16:38,725
MATT: Scanlan was going to act first, and then
we'll get to you.

1206
01:16:38,725 --> 01:16:40,578
ORION: I want to be like, excuse me, and I--
sorry.

1207
01:16:40,578 --> 01:16:46,999
SAM: I said, I see this happening. I go over and I
use Friends to cast--

1208
01:16:46,999 --> 01:16:51,771
MATT: As you're about to walk over, Tiberius puts
his hand out and goes--

1209
01:16:51,771 --> 01:16:56,736
ORION: No! Excuse me. And I pull out ten gold
coins. That's all I actually have because I had

1210
01:16:56,736 --> 01:17:01,258
ten left, (laughs) and I take those, and I give
them. I'm sorry. This has been a misunderstanding.

1211
01:17:01,258 --> 01:17:06,400
She's foreign, and she's royalty. Please, I'm from
Draconia. She's from-- she's a druid. I say all

1212
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,592
this shit really quick, and I'm like, I'm so, so
sorry.

1213
01:17:08,592 --> 01:17:12,115
MARISHA: I worship the ever-loving unicorn,
Rainbow Fluffers.

1214
01:17:12,115 --> 01:17:19,364
MATT: Make a deception check with disadvantage,
because he's already pissed off with this.

1215
01:17:19,364 --> 01:17:25,525
ORION: What was it? Deception?

1216
01:17:25,525 --> 01:17:27,953
MARISHA: He rolled a 12 and a 13.

1217
01:17:27,953 --> 01:17:31,251
ORION: Deception? So that's 22 and 21.

1218
01:17:31,251 --> 01:17:39,799
MATT: Okay. The Bastion glares at you, looks over
at one of the nearby Bastions. You see two

1219
01:17:39,799 --> 01:17:46,078
manacles clank down on your wrists. Another
Bastion to your left and the Bastion that's

1220
01:17:46,253 --> 01:17:49,517
holding you both says, "Apparently, she's got
people helping her out. Come on. We're dragging

1221
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:51,874
"her off." You both are being pulled away

1222
01:17:51,874 --> 01:17:55,709
ORION: As they do that, I'm like, you said
dragon!

1223
01:17:55,709 --> 01:17:58,840
MATT: You guys are being dragged away from the
Crucible. Grog.

1224
01:17:58,840 --> 01:17:59,854
TRAVIS: It's my turn?

1225
01:17:59,854 --> 01:18:00,741
MATT: It is your turn.

1226
01:18:00,741 --> 01:18:02,614
TRAVIS: I come back from that knee to the solar
plexus.

1227
01:18:02,614 --> 01:18:04,348
MARISHA: Right, guys, have fun! Root for Grog for
us!

1228
01:18:04,348 --> 01:18:08,652
TRAVIS: I reach out and grab the back of his head,
and I drive my elbow straight into his chin.

1229
01:18:08,652 --> 01:18:09,693
MATT: Go for it.

1230
01:18:09,693 --> 01:18:12,506
TRAVIS: 25?

1231
01:18:12,506 --> 01:18:13,652
MATT: 25 does hit.

1232
01:18:13,652 --> 01:18:15,994
TRAVIS: Yes! Eight.

1233
01:18:15,994 --> 01:18:17,078
MATT: All righty.

1234
01:18:17,078 --> 01:18:24,349
TRAVIS: As it carries through, I'd like to come
back with a back elbow, same spot. Boom.

1235
01:18:24,349 --> 01:18:26,938
MATT: All righty. Roll for an attack on that.

1236
01:18:26,938 --> 01:18:29,555
TRAVIS: 16.

1237
01:18:29,555 --> 01:18:35,028
MATT: No. (whoosh) Parries it to the side after
the first impact sets his jaw off to the side

1238
01:18:35,028 --> 01:18:37,876
again. (crack) Snaps it back into place.

1239
01:18:38,026 --> 01:18:38,865
TRAVIS: Last one?

1240
01:18:38,865 --> 01:18:39,669
MATT: Last one.

1241
01:18:39,669 --> 01:18:42,927
TRAVIS: Since I'm standing and I probably whiffed,
I see that knee that I've been working on, and I

1242
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:45,043
throw my heel out and try and pop it in.

1243
01:18:45,043 --> 01:18:46,790
MATT: Okay.

1244
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:48,158
TRAVIS: Yes! 27.

1245
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:50,739
MATT: 27 does hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

1246
01:18:50,739 --> 01:18:51,778
TRAVIS: Eight.

1247
01:18:51,778 --> 01:18:59,883
MATT: Eight. All right. You go forward and (pop)
your foot finds the side of the knee, and the knee

1248
01:18:59,883 --> 01:19:06,948
this time buckles under the weight (cracking) off
to the side. Kern falls onto one knee, puts both

1249
01:19:06,948 --> 01:19:10,728
hands out on the ground, and (coughing) coughs up
this sputtering puddle of blood that then spills

1250
01:19:10,728 --> 01:19:16,038
out on the ground. Kern looks like that blow is
about to knock Kern over to the side, but Kern

1251
01:19:16,038 --> 01:19:23,194
sits there and tenses his muscles. His head whips
up at you, and that orcish glare, that sheer focus

1252
01:19:23,194 --> 01:19:30,032
of fury that you saw once before, is holding him
on the edge. Kern looks up at you.

1253
01:19:30,032 --> 01:19:37,079
"No, this is my town!" (roars)

1254
01:19:37,079 --> 01:19:44,039
and leaps up at you with a flurry
of an extremely desperate half-orc. First strike

1255
01:19:44,039 --> 01:19:46,590
comes at you. That is a 22 to hit.

1256
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:47,590
TRAVIS: Hits.

1257
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:51,383
MATT: That is a 27 to hit.

1258
01:19:51,383 --> 01:19:52,619
TRAVIS: Hits.

1259
01:19:52,619 --> 01:19:54,170
MATT: And natural 20.

1260
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:56,426
(groaning)

1261
01:19:56,426 --> 01:19:58,440
MATT: First strike is ten points of damage.

1262
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,086
TRAVIS: Ten points. Okay.

1263
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:02,579
MATT: Next one is eight points of damage.

1264
01:20:02,579 --> 01:20:03,869
TRAVIS: Okay.

1265
01:20:03,869 --> 01:20:08,960
MATT: Last one which is eight, six, 14 points of
damage.

1266
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:10,056
TRAVIS: Right, okay.

1267
01:20:10,056 --> 01:20:11,163
MATT: What are you at?

1268
01:20:11,163 --> 01:20:15,164
TRAVIS: So that puts me at negative 13. I use my
Relentless Rage.

1269
01:20:15,164 --> 01:20:17,035
SAM: Oh! What is that?

1270
01:20:17,035 --> 01:20:20,209
TALIESIN: Our little boy's growing up!

1271
01:20:20,209 --> 01:20:28,546
MATT: So Grog is put in the negative as the orc
has pummeled you, and you feel (doosh, doosh), and

1272
01:20:28,546 --> 01:20:32,882
with a final resounding crack, the knee comes up,
slamming you into your chin. You feel your body

1273
01:20:32,882 --> 01:20:36,969
begin to fade. Your vision begin to dull to black.

1274
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:41,834
SAM: I just won 100 gold!

1275
01:20:41,834 --> 01:20:44,799
MATT: At that point, you feel that seething anger, that

1276
01:20:44,799 --> 01:20:50,771
rage, that medallion that was given to you, the
section of lip that is now missing from your face.

1277
01:20:50,771 --> 01:20:53,658
Let me go and see what this is. Relentless Rage.

1278
01:20:53,658 --> 01:20:58,730
ORION: For Philip! No, it's Grog now. I'm not
there; I'm arrested.

1279
01:20:58,730 --> 01:21:00,944
MATT: All right, make a constitution saving throw
right now.

1280
01:21:00,944 --> 01:21:03,567
TRAVIS: 21.

1281
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:06,664
MATT: 21. You instead drop to one hit point.

1282
01:21:06,664 --> 01:21:08,096
TRAVIS: One hit point.

1283
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:13,372
MATT: All of a sudden, the rage pulls you through,
and your whole body (whipping noise) snaps up into

1284
01:21:13,372 --> 01:21:18,165
place again, and you can see Kern before you has
this grin on his face that he's just watched

1285
01:21:18,165 --> 01:21:25,671
victory come to him, and then it's torn away. His
eyes open and that half-orcish rage suddenly fades

1286
01:21:25,671 --> 01:21:31,880
for a second as you see, for the first time, deep
fear take the heart of your combatant.

1287
01:21:32,008 --> 01:21:33,205
Take your turn.

1288
01:21:33,205 --> 01:21:40,246
TRAVIS: I look at my arms, I look at him, I spit
blood into the sand, and I say, well, well. Where

1289
01:21:40,246 --> 01:21:47,967
have I seen this happen before? Time's up. And I
run forward and in a massive arcing uppercut, I

1290
01:21:47,967 --> 01:21:51,533
drive my fist under his jaw with everything I
have.

1291
01:21:51,533 --> 01:21:53,319
MATT: Go ahead and roll for damage.

1292
01:21:53,319 --> 01:21:54,915
TRAVIS: Oh, damage?

1293
01:21:54,915 --> 01:21:56,123
MATT: Roll for attack.

1294
01:21:56,123 --> 01:22:00,158
TRAVIS: Okay. Oh, shit. 18?

1295
01:22:00,158 --> 01:22:05,909
MATT: 18? As you rush forward he, through the
fear, still brings his hand up and slaps the first

1296
01:22:05,909 --> 01:22:07,933
hit out of the way. Second attack.

1297
01:22:07,933 --> 01:22:14,282
TRAVIS: I look down and I say, (sighs) Very well,
respect. And I take my elbow and

1298
01:22:14,282 --> 01:22:15,732
drive it into his temple.

1299
01:22:15,732 --> 01:22:18,045
MATT: Roll for second attack.

1300
01:22:18,045 --> 01:22:19,358
TRAVIS: 15.

1301
01:22:19,358 --> 01:22:23,994
MATT: 15. The second one, brings back and parries
it to the side. (heavy breathing)

1302
01:22:23,994 --> 01:22:29,240
LAURA: I lift up my shirt and I say, I love you,
Grog!

1303
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,193
SAM: Oh my god, it's her tits! It's her tits!

1304
01:22:31,193 --> 01:22:34,800
MATT: Through the fury of your rage--

1305
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,304
SAM: She just showed her tits. That's inspiring!

1306
01:22:37,304 --> 01:22:42,757
MATT: In this moment, if that were to distract
Grog, I'm afraid Grog would drop his rage.

1307
01:22:42,757 --> 01:22:44,546
TRAVIS: (laughing) Don't, no.

1308
01:22:44,546 --> 01:22:46,184
LAURA: Never mind! I put my shirt back on.

1309
01:22:46,184 --> 01:22:52,615
MATT: However, the entire other side of the
Crucible right now is going (gasps, cheers) they

1310
01:22:52,615 --> 01:23:02,858
all burst into cheers. Vax, by the way, is
standing behind you and going, "Sister!" and is

1311
01:23:02,858 --> 01:23:05,471
pulling your shirt down for you, and is
desperately trying--

1312
01:23:05,471 --> 01:23:06,987
LAURA: 600 gold!

1313
01:23:06,987 --> 01:23:08,866
TRAVIS: I've missed the uppercut.

1314
01:23:08,866 --> 01:23:10,248
MATT: Missed the elbow.

1315
01:23:10,248 --> 01:23:11,277
TRAVIS: Missed the elbow.

1316
01:23:11,277 --> 01:23:12,723
SAM: Can I sing from the audience?

1317
01:23:12,723 --> 01:23:14,438
MATT: At this, not right now.

1318
01:23:14,438 --> 01:23:15,671
SAM: It's all this roll.

1319
01:23:15,671 --> 01:23:17,054
MATT: It's the middle of his turn.

1320
01:23:17,054 --> 01:23:21,446
TRAVIS: I take both of my fists up over my head,
and I just bring it down.

1321
01:23:21,446 --> 01:23:23,279
MATT: All right. Roll for it.

1322
01:23:23,279 --> 01:23:26,508
TRAVIS: 13.

1323
01:23:26,508 --> 01:23:35,161
MATT: 13. Kern simply slaps it out of your way,
and you can see the fear begin to fade, and for a

1324
01:23:35,161 --> 01:23:41,221
second, looks at you and sees, truly, how close on
the edge you are. "Oh, you've proven yourself this

1325
01:23:41,221 --> 01:23:48,720
"day, but there is only one champion of the
Crucible." You're up, Scanlan.

1326
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:54,763
SAM: Yeah, so I was going sing to him to inspire.
I guess I can still try.

1327
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:56,579
MATT: Yeah, go for it, what do you want to sing?

1328
01:23:56,579 --> 01:24:04,656
SAM: I sing, (singing) with your arms, and your
fists, and your legs, and your wrists, it's in

1329
01:24:04,656 --> 01:24:05,765
your head--

1330
01:24:05,765 --> 01:24:08,709
ALL: (singing) In your head, you are fighting.

1331
01:24:08,709 --> 01:24:10,581
SAM: That's all I got.

1332
01:24:10,581 --> 01:24:14,966
MATT: d10 inspiration die to you, Grog, in this
pinnacle moment, so hold on to that d10.

1333
01:24:14,966 --> 01:24:16,703
TRAVIS: Okay.

1334
01:24:16,703 --> 01:24:25,618
MATT: All right. Kern, now intensely scared, is
using his action to go into his dodge maneuver.

1335
01:24:25,618 --> 01:24:30,855
He's on the edge. You can see, one eye is swollen
shut and he (deep breath) goes into the stance to

1336
01:24:30,855 --> 01:24:35,851
defend himself. However, as his bonus action, all
of a sudden takes two steps forward and almost

1337
01:24:35,851 --> 01:24:43,337
Bruce Lee one-inch (whipping noise) punches to
your torso. That is nine plus eight. 17.

1338
01:24:43,337 --> 01:24:44,501
TRAVIS: Misses.

1339
01:24:44,501 --> 01:24:50,170
MATT: Misses. Goes to punch; however, the short
distance, while the speed is extreme, misjudged

1340
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:54,593
the distance and it stops an inch before your
chest. You look down, and it's barely stopping

1341
01:24:54,593 --> 01:24:59,659
before it finds your chest. Looks up at you. "Come
at me."

1342
01:24:59,659 --> 01:25:02,107
MARISHA: He just come-at-me-bro'd you!

1343
01:25:02,107 --> 01:25:05,481
SAM: Is he in defense now?

1344
01:25:05,481 --> 01:25:07,735
MATT: He's in dodge mode, yeah.

1345
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:09,360
SAM: He's in dodge, so it's at disadvantage?

1346
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,277
MATT: So all of your attacks are at disadvantage.

1347
01:25:11,277 --> 01:25:14,772
TRAVIS: I want to leap at him and try and grab him
around the waist.

1348
01:25:14,772 --> 01:25:18,197
LAURA: Oh my god. Just hit him.

1349
01:25:18,197 --> 01:25:19,527
MARISHA: Take him down!

1350
01:25:19,527 --> 01:25:21,401
TRAVIS: I get three-- no.

1351
01:25:21,401 --> 01:25:22,853
SAM: Just hit him!

1352
01:25:22,853 --> 01:25:25,708
MATT: Do what you want, Grog. Do what you want.
What are you doing?

1353
01:25:25,708 --> 01:25:31,257
TRAVIS: All right, fine, fuck it. With desperation
that this might fall away, I throw my goliath fist

1354
01:25:31,257 --> 01:25:32,085
at him.

1355
01:25:32,085 --> 01:25:35,585
MATT: All right, so first punch (grunts), with
disadvantage.

1356
01:25:35,585 --> 01:25:38,037
TRAVIS: 19. Nine. 17.

1357
01:25:38,037 --> 01:25:39,948
ORION: Plus ten!

1358
01:25:39,948 --> 01:25:42,314
TRAVIS: 22!

1359
01:25:42,314 --> 01:25:45,857
MATT: 22! (whoosh) Roll damage.

1360
01:25:45,857 --> 01:25:47,867
TRAVIS: Eight!

1361
01:25:47,867 --> 01:25:49,122
MATT: How do you want to do this?

1362
01:25:49,122 --> 01:25:55,121
(cheering)

1363
01:25:55,121 --> 01:26:01,682
MATT: (laughs) RIP ears, everyone.
Clutch Scanlan inspiration. Grog, how do you want

1364
01:26:01,726 --> 01:26:03,134
to do this?

1365
01:26:03,134 --> 01:26:10,527
TRAVIS: (chuckles) As the fist connects and he
starts to wobble, I reach over. I stand above him

1366
01:26:10,527 --> 01:26:17,306
and grab around his waist with his back facing
towards me. I lift him up over my head so that his

1367
01:26:17,306 --> 01:26:21,715
head gets to come up and look at the crowd one
last time before sending him straight back onto

1368
01:26:21,715 --> 01:26:24,941
his shoulder blades and neck and smashing him into
the earth!

1369
01:26:24,941 --> 01:26:31,879
MATT: (smash) With a resounding slam, Kern's body
impacts into the stone floor of the Crucible, a

1370
01:26:31,879 --> 01:26:37,255
cloud of dirt and dust (whoosh) around. Rocks
break off and tumble down the side of the walls of

1371
01:26:37,255 --> 01:26:41,411
the Crucible as the crowd has to stop themselves
from falling in from the sheer impact of the

1372
01:26:41,411 --> 01:26:48,201
tremor that you've left slamming Kern. You can see
everyone fall silent; the crowd's cheers all come

1373
01:26:48,201 --> 01:26:55,503
to a sudden halt. The dust settles. You can see
nothing at the base of the Crucible. As the cloud

1374
01:26:55,503 --> 01:27:01,741
slowly comes to rest, you see there, broken and
laid out on the ground is an unconscious,

1375
01:27:01,741 --> 01:27:08,478
bloodied, and ruined Kern, as Grog steps forward,
head hunched beneath his billowing shoulders,

1376
01:27:08,478 --> 01:27:12,892
fists clenched in anger, victorious in the center
of the Crucible.

1377
01:27:12,892 --> 01:27:18,912
TRAVIS: I put my foot on his chest and do my best
King Kong. (yells)

1378
01:27:18,912 --> 01:27:25,764
MATT: At which point, the crowd raises into
shouting cheers, claps--

1379
01:27:25,764 --> 01:27:27,646
LAURA: Did I show my boobs?!

1380
01:27:27,646 --> 01:27:29,001
SAM: No.

1381
01:27:29,001 --> 01:27:33,068
TALIESIN: None of us remember that. At all.

1382
01:27:33,068 --> 01:27:43,179
MATT: The bookie screams out, "We have now a new
champion of the Crucible! Not Philip, but Grog,

1383
01:27:43,179 --> 01:27:50,525
"the Victorious!" Cheers and shouts, and you hear
loud boos, even curses shouted. You see people

1384
01:27:50,525 --> 01:27:57,172
shouting off, throwing empty coin purses off to
the side, different language-- it's a whole

1385
01:27:57,172 --> 01:28:04,308
cacophony of cheers and curses, and then all of
them fall suddenly quiet. The whole crowd turns

1386
01:28:04,308 --> 01:28:10,499
over to the edge of the Crucible. You see standing
over-- let me bring this down here for a moment of

1387
01:28:10,499 --> 01:28:18,087
tension-- standing over to the edge, a hood is
thrown back on a figure that's been watching the

1388
01:28:18,087 --> 01:28:30,181
entire fight. You notice this figure, as the hood
is thrown back: an older human man in his mid- to

1389
01:28:30,181 --> 01:28:40,695
late-sixties with tough reddish tanned skin.
Short, but stocky. Receding gray hairline with a

1390
01:28:40,695 --> 01:28:46,171
long, coarse gray beard that tumbles to his belt
line. He wears what looks like ceremonial robes of

1391
01:28:46,171 --> 01:28:51,766
red and gold, simple wooden sandals, and a dark
brown necklace of large, two-inch round beads that

1392
01:28:51,766 --> 01:28:57,803
adorn the shoulders and neck area. His body is
stout and ripped as muscle, trained over a

1393
01:28:57,803 --> 01:29:02,911
lifetime of martial prowess and careful honing.
His arms are crossed as he looks down at the

1394
01:29:02,911 --> 01:29:12,001
Crucible, down at you, Grog. Gives a nod and a
smile. Turns around and walks away from the crowd,

1395
01:29:12,001 --> 01:29:22,486
quietly, as everyone silently takes in this
momentary experience. A few seconds pass, and then

1396
01:29:22,486 --> 01:29:24,828
the crowd continues cheering once again.

1397
01:29:24,828 --> 01:29:31,180
(cheering)

1398
01:29:31,180 --> 01:29:36,666
MATT: The clerics now come climbing down to the
center of the Crucible to retrieve the unconscious

1399
01:29:36,666 --> 01:29:42,815
and bleeding-out body of Kern, administering Heals
immediately to make sure he doesn't actually slip

1400
01:29:42,815 --> 01:29:43,769
away from everyone.

1401
01:29:43,769 --> 01:29:49,321
TRAVIS: I run over and grab my lip and pick it up
and go, just between you and me, is there anything

1402
01:29:49,321 --> 01:29:50,681
we can do with this?

1403
01:29:50,681 --> 01:29:52,663
(laughter)

1404
01:29:52,663 --> 01:29:57,708
MATT: One of the clerics looks up for a second.
"Hold it there for a moment." And reaches out and

1405
01:29:57,708 --> 01:30:05,673
administers a 5th-level Cure Wounds. He's making a
medicine check to see how-- well, that's a 16. You

1406
01:30:05,673 --> 01:30:16,737
go ahead and heal-- that's shitty rolls-- ten. I
should've just rolled that one there. You heal 22

1407
01:30:16,737 --> 01:30:23,399
hit points, but you feel your lip fuse, and while
it might leave a very small scar, it is in one

1408
01:30:23,399 --> 01:30:27,761
piece. You might want to be careful about spitting
or anything too heavy with it for the next few

1409
01:30:27,761 --> 01:30:31,397
days for fear of jettisoning it from the front of
your face accidentally.

1410
01:30:31,397 --> 01:30:37,021
TRAVIS: Right, or growing a beard on it-- oh,
that's already on my chin.

1411
01:30:37,021 --> 01:30:40,290
TALIESIN: If you grow enough beard, you can knit
it together to hold it in place.

1412
01:30:40,290 --> 01:30:42,555
TRAVIS: I'm actually sweating.

1413
01:30:42,555 --> 01:30:44,042
LAURA: Yeah. I am, too.

1414
01:30:44,042 --> 01:30:48,073
MATT: You make your way up the rope ladder to the
top of the Crucible as the crowd-- some folks come

1415
01:30:48,203 --> 01:30:52,987
up and cheer and grab your hand and shake it.
"Thank you. I believed you'd do this. Kern's been

1416
01:30:52,987 --> 01:30:56,729
"sent in there too long. It's about time he got
taken down." (laughs) And he gets pushed out of

1417
01:30:56,729 --> 01:31:01,837
the way by another person, a young guy, 16: scrawny
but excited, "You're my new hero. Oh my god. Oh,

1418
01:31:01,837 --> 01:31:04,258
"Grog. Where did you learn to train? Can I train
with you?"

1419
01:31:04,258 --> 01:31:14,648
TRAVIS: Grog's not here right now. This is Philip.
If you'd like to leave a message, come back another time.

1420
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:20,670
Got to go, bye! And I walk away. I find
Scanlan in the crowd, and I reach out and shake

1421
01:31:20,670 --> 01:31:21,701
his hand.

1422
01:31:21,701 --> 01:31:23,067
SAM: Ow!

1423
01:31:23,067 --> 01:31:25,573
TRAVIS: Sorry, little bit of ongoing rage.

1424
01:31:25,573 --> 01:31:29,875
TALIESIN: Scanlan, are you all right? You look a
little poorer, somehow. Have you lost money? You

1425
01:31:29,875 --> 01:31:32,343
look like you've lost money. Especially in the
face.

1426
01:31:32,343 --> 01:31:33,762
SAM: Well, it was worth it.

1427
01:31:33,762 --> 01:31:38,919
TRAVIS: I heard your voices cutting through the
crowd. Where are Tiberius and Keyleth?

1428
01:31:38,919 --> 01:31:44,857
ORION: Grog, we got arrested while you were
fighting, just so you know.

1429
01:31:44,857 --> 01:31:48,762
MATT: You guys, by the way, right now are
currently brought to a small holding facility not

1430
01:31:48,762 --> 01:31:53,879
far from the Crucible, where you've been set down
on a bench, both manacled and left while the one

1431
01:31:53,879 --> 01:31:57,195
Bastion that originally found you is currently
keeping watch.

1432
01:31:57,195 --> 01:31:58,152
TRAVIS: Outside?

1433
01:31:58,152 --> 01:32:00,302
MATT: Out of vision of you guys. You don't see;
they're just missing.

1434
01:32:00,302 --> 01:32:09,666
SAM: Grog, before we go deal with our friends, if
I may: That man fought a brave fight. I feel you

1435
01:32:09,666 --> 01:32:15,080
should go make amends with him, it was a
respectable battle. You won't feel good about

1436
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:17,117
yourself unless you do.

1437
01:32:17,117 --> 01:32:19,917
MATT: At which point, the bookie hands a sack of
gold right into your hand.

1438
01:32:19,917 --> 01:32:23,020
"Well fought, new champion!" And hands it to you.

1439
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:29,542
TRAVIS: Fuck that shit. (laughs) I was about to,
but chaotic neutral, sorry!

1440
01:32:29,542 --> 01:32:31,392
(laughter)

1441
01:32:31,392 --> 01:32:32,431
ORION: Never mind.

1442
01:32:32,431 --> 01:32:33,361
TRAVIS: I was ready.

1443
01:32:33,361 --> 01:32:34,830
TALIESIN: And that, kids, is chaotic neutral.

1444
01:32:34,830 --> 01:32:40,235
MATT: At three to one odds, that sack of gold you
get back contains 5,452 gold pieces.

1445
01:32:40,282 --> 01:32:44,915
LAURA: You know what's so great about that, Grog?
You said you were going to pay back the gold you

1446
01:32:44,915 --> 01:32:46,487
lost me in the first fight.

1447
01:32:46,487 --> 01:32:52,769
TRAVIS: I did. And I pay it back happily as I look
at her dragon eyes of money hoarding.

1448
01:32:52,769 --> 01:32:55,171
MATT: Okay. You go ahead and work out that payback to
her.

1449
01:32:55,171 --> 01:32:56,288
LAURA: All right!

1450
01:32:56,288 --> 01:32:58,916
ORION: I'm going to use the earring real quick
again. Whenever you're free, Grog.

1451
01:32:58,948 --> 01:33:06,130
TRAVIS: And handing money to Vex has sobered me up
a little bit. I do walk over to Kern the Hammer

1452
01:33:06,130 --> 01:33:10,247
and extend a hand and say, well fought, brother.

1453
01:33:10,247 --> 01:33:14,100
MATT: His arms are currently draped over two of
the clerics that have pulled him out of the

1454
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:21,260
Crucible, face broken, blood streaked down one
side of his face. Is stepping with one foot,

1455
01:33:21,297 --> 01:33:25,937
dragging the toes of the other. (grunts) Is
brought to turn around to face you by the two

1456
01:33:25,937 --> 01:33:31,564
clerics and looks at you as you extend your hand.
Looks over at you. One eye swollen shut, the other

1457
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:36,059
glaring at you, bloodshot and angry. You see the
teeth are gritted and grinding beneath his

1458
01:33:36,059 --> 01:33:48,386
still-busted, missing upper lip. (snarls, laughs)
"Well fought, goliath." And he (groans) brings one

1459
01:33:48,386 --> 01:33:52,104
hand around one of the clerics and takes you in a
Beastmaster--

1460
01:33:52,104 --> 01:33:53,995
TRAVIS: Yes! Strength and honor!

1461
01:33:53,995 --> 01:34:02,304
MATT: However, there is no strength left. It's
barely there. He takes his hand back and it hangs

1462
01:34:02,304 --> 01:34:10,774
loosely to one side, and he looks at you and says,
"I'm proud to have finally found my match. When I

1463
01:34:10,809 --> 01:34:17,346
"recover, I'm going to find you, and I'm going to
want that championship back!"

1464
01:34:17,346 --> 01:34:21,698
TRAVIS: When the time comes for a rematch, I'll be
here.

1465
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:26,915
MATT: "Good. Where can I find you, Grog?"

1466
01:34:26,915 --> 01:34:28,467
TRAVIS: (quietly) Oh shit.

1467
01:34:28,467 --> 01:34:32,090
SAM: Yeah, yeah. Just tell him.

1468
01:34:32,090 --> 01:34:39,565
TRAVIS: If I'm not here at the Crucible, because I
don't think you need an audience for glory, you

1469
01:34:39,565 --> 01:34:42,585
can always find me in Emon at Castle Greyskull.

1470
01:34:42,585 --> 01:34:44,956
LAURA: Greyskull Keep!

1471
01:34:44,956 --> 01:34:46,286
TRAVIS: Greyskull Keep!

1472
01:34:46,286 --> 01:34:48,022
SAM: It's a real place.

1473
01:34:48,022 --> 01:34:53,183
LAURA: Good luck with your dick, by the way. Sorry
about that.

1474
01:34:53,183 --> 01:34:59,553
MATT: He looks over at you, (groans) and you see
for a minute he had forgotten about that in this

1475
01:34:59,553 --> 01:35:06,086
exchange of honor, and some of the pain resurges,
and (moans) starts whimpering, (coughs up spit)

1476
01:35:06,086 --> 01:35:10,910
spits off to the side this giant bloody loogie
that slaps on one of the sides of the cleric who's

1477
01:35:10,910 --> 01:35:13,627
like, "Ugh!" Starts wiping it from the outside of
his tunic.

1478
01:35:13,627 --> 01:35:22,854
Looks back at you. "Greyskull. So be it. Ow." And
hobbles away through a series of painful whimpers

1479
01:35:22,985 --> 01:35:28,937
and whines. Percy, the bookie collects you. You
bet 500 at a three to one; that is four times

1480
01:35:29,016 --> 01:35:30,578
return. You make 2,000 gold.

1481
01:35:30,578 --> 01:35:31,885
TALIESIN: Beautiful!

1482
01:35:31,885 --> 01:35:33,773
MARISHA: I've made 20 gold.

1483
01:35:33,773 --> 01:35:37,106
MATT: You haven't made anything yet. You're
arrested.

1484
01:35:37,106 --> 01:35:38,203
MARISHA: I'm arrested.

1485
01:35:38,203 --> 01:35:41,523
MATT: 2,400 to you, Vex.

1486
01:35:41,523 --> 01:35:42,624
LAURA: Fuck yeah!

1487
01:35:42,624 --> 01:35:45,948
SAM: I'm here to collect my winnings, please.

1488
01:35:45,948 --> 01:35:52,771
MATT: The Bastion laughs. "Then you would owe
me 300 gold."

1489
01:35:52,771 --> 01:35:55,955
SAM: No, I bet on Grog, if you remember
correctly.

1490
01:35:55,955 --> 01:36:00,010
MATT: "No, I have it here in my ledger that you
bet against your friend Grog."

1491
01:36:00,010 --> 01:36:02,200
LAURA: Oh, he would never do that. I believe you
are mistaken, actually.

1492
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:09,086
SAM: There must be a typo. I bet on Grog. Don't
you remember?

1493
01:36:09,086 --> 01:36:11,532
MATT: Are you casting something?

1494
01:36:11,532 --> 01:36:13,549
SAM: Nope, I'm just doing this.

1495
01:36:13,549 --> 01:36:17,067
MATT: Go ahead and make a deception roll.

1496
01:36:17,067 --> 01:36:18,656
LAURA: Can I back him up?

1497
01:36:18,656 --> 01:36:21,057
SAM: Nope.

1498
01:36:21,057 --> 01:36:23,299
MATT: What did you roll?

1499
01:36:23,299 --> 01:36:29,135
SAM: Two. Well, wait. What is this, deception or
persuasion? What is this?

1500
01:36:29,135 --> 01:36:30,672
LAURA: Deception. Oh, that's so high!

1501
01:36:30,672 --> 01:36:31,868
MATT: Deception.

1502
01:36:31,868 --> 01:36:33,529
SAM: Yeah, it's 15. No, it's not good, no.

1503
01:36:33,529 --> 01:36:36,974
MATT: He gives you a look and goes, "No, you did
not."

1504
01:36:36,974 --> 01:36:42,388
SAM: I've got to work on this.

1505
01:36:42,388 --> 01:36:47,096
MATT: And he whips around and takes his cloak
around, dismissing you, taking you out of the

1506
01:36:47,096 --> 01:36:49,470
conversation, and walks back towards the Bellows'
Respite Inn.

1507
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:56,768
ORION: Can I now use the damn earring? Okay. Grog,
(stutters) could you use your clout to get us out

1508
01:36:56,768 --> 01:36:57,889
of holding?

1509
01:36:57,889 --> 01:37:01,409
TRAVIS: What? You're in holding? Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm a pretty big deal.

1510
01:37:01,409 --> 01:37:05,676
LAURA: What's going on? You were arrested? Why?

1511
01:37:05,676 --> 01:37:08,887
ORION: Because Keyleth tried to do something, and
I tried to talk her out of it and it didn't work

1512
01:37:08,887 --> 01:37:10,709
out, and we're now in holding. It's
fine.

1513
01:37:10,768 --> 01:37:12,634
MARISHA: Oh, bullshit, you tried to talk me out of
it.

1514
01:37:12,634 --> 01:37:13,873
LAURA: You tried to talk out what?

1515
01:37:13,873 --> 01:37:15,114
ORION: I mean, I tried to help her out.

1516
01:37:15,114 --> 01:37:18,182
TRAVIS: Tiberius, what can you see around you?

1517
01:37:18,182 --> 01:37:21,063
ORION: A guard looking at me.

1518
01:37:21,063 --> 01:37:23,689
LAURA: Can I track them?

1519
01:37:23,689 --> 01:37:26,690
MATT: Make a survival check.

1520
01:37:26,690 --> 01:37:34,787
TALIESIN: If someone were to be an idiot, where
would you take them to hold them?

1521
01:37:34,787 --> 01:37:36,872
LAURA: 16.

1522
01:37:36,872 --> 01:37:40,756
MATT: Because you know their tracks, their
footprints-- I would put it at a disadvantage, but

1523
01:37:40,756 --> 01:37:44,976
that would cancel it out. At a 16, you
look around. You can see there is a track of two

1524
01:37:45,029 --> 01:37:49,466
people with their feet being dragged behind two
heavy footprints by heavily armored individuals

1525
01:37:49,466 --> 01:37:53,975
that lead. There are three buildings off to the side
and there is what looks to be a small station for

1526
01:37:54,018 --> 01:38:03,153
holding, a general Bastion satellite station
within this portion of the Braving Grounds.

1527
01:38:03,225 --> 01:38:06,055
LAURA: Can we go over and knock?

1528
01:38:06,055 --> 01:38:12,144
MATT: You knock. A few seconds pass and the door
slides open a little bit, and from the inside, you

1529
01:38:12,188 --> 01:38:17,745
can see a partially scarred on one cheek, late
thirties, early forties gentleman who looks

1530
01:38:17,745 --> 01:38:21,888
square-jawed and definitely trained in some
semblance of looking gruff and angry and says,

1531
01:38:21,888 --> 01:38:23,323
"Can I help you?"

1532
01:38:23,323 --> 01:38:29,374
LAURA: Hi, yes. I'm looking for-- (sighs) I'm
looking for a couple of people. They're actually

1533
01:38:29,374 --> 01:38:33,073
mental patients, and they've gotten loose.

1534
01:38:33,073 --> 01:38:34,343
ORION: Vex! Here we are!

1535
01:38:34,343 --> 01:38:38,521
LAURA: Oh! That's them, I'm afraid.

1536
01:38:38,521 --> 01:38:41,352
MATT: "These two cheaters over here? These are the
ones you're looking for?"

1537
01:38:41,352 --> 01:38:49,354
LAURA: Cheaters? Well, that makes sense. They
don't understand normal social rules.

1538
01:38:49,354 --> 01:38:51,346
ORION: I'm from Draconia!

1539
01:38:51,346 --> 01:38:57,615
MARISHA: And I'm also... not from here.

1540
01:38:57,615 --> 01:38:59,952
LAURA: You see what I'm talking about?

1541
01:38:59,952 --> 01:39:02,681
MATT: Go ahead and make a deception check.

1542
01:39:02,681 --> 01:39:06,154
ORION: Just say where you're from. That's easy.

1543
01:39:06,154 --> 01:39:10,460
MARISHA: Zephra. But they don't know what that
means.

1544
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:13,768
ORION: I'm sure they don't know what Draconia is,
but I like to spread the word.

1545
01:39:13,768 --> 01:39:14,953
LAURA: 24.

1546
01:39:14,953 --> 01:39:23,082
MATT: 24. Okay. He gives you a look and says,
"Well, look. We have reason to believe they may

1547
01:39:23,102 --> 01:39:28,296
"have been trying to fix and/or rig the bets on the
recent bout out here in the Crucible. That is a very

1548
01:39:28,355 --> 01:39:30,619
"serious offense here in the Braving Grounds."

1549
01:39:30,648 --> 01:39:32,502
LAURA: I can imagine it would be, yes.

1550
01:39:32,502 --> 01:39:35,503
MATT: "However, I don't want to deal with the
processing and the time it takes, so if these are

1551
01:39:35,503 --> 01:39:39,737
"indeed your charges and you're willing to fill out
some paperwork and pay the fines right now, we'll

1552
01:39:39,737 --> 01:39:40,949
"relinquish them to you."

1553
01:39:40,949 --> 01:39:43,116
SAM: Well, what's the fine? How much was the
fine?

1554
01:39:43,116 --> 01:39:43,971
MATT: Who are you?

1555
01:39:43,971 --> 01:39:45,379
LAURA: Oh, he's my lawyer.

1556
01:39:45,379 --> 01:39:56,716
SAM: I'm Burt Reynolds, esquire. I'm an attorney
at large. I represent all manner of escaped

1557
01:39:56,716 --> 01:39:58,969
mental patients. (laughs)

1558
01:39:59,394 --> 01:40:01,501
MATT: Make a deception check.

1559
01:40:01,501 --> 01:40:03,239
TRAVIS: The mustache is up.

1560
01:40:03,239 --> 01:40:04,791
SAM: 20.

1561
01:40:04,791 --> 01:40:10,560
MATT: "Very well, small Reynolds, sir."

1562
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:15,882
SAM: If you would like us to fill out the
paperwork. I have about two reams of paperwork for

1563
01:40:15,882 --> 01:40:21,637
you to fill out, to release them to us, as
well. And also there will be court costs involved,

1564
01:40:21,637 --> 01:40:27,978
oh boy, in triplicate. You'll have to get your
supervisor to fill out this one, and I will need

1565
01:40:27,978 --> 01:40:30,210
this one, and I will need this one, as well--

1566
01:40:30,210 --> 01:40:32,626
MATT: "500 gold's fine, and we'll release them to
you. All right? Is that fine?"

1567
01:40:32,626 --> 01:40:36,466
SAM: Oh, 500 gold. That's fine. And they'll still
get to collect their winnings from the pit?

1568
01:40:36,466 --> 01:40:38,789
MATT: "I don't care what they're going to do, just
take them from me!"

1569
01:40:38,789 --> 01:40:46,122
SAM: Great, thank you sir. You know what, I can
make this paperwork disappear. This is fine.

1570
01:40:46,122 --> 01:40:49,296
LAURA: Actually, for a small-- never mind.

1571
01:40:49,296 --> 01:40:51,313
TALIESIN: Just let it go.

1572
01:40:51,313 --> 01:41:00,190
LAURA: I noped myself on that one. Here you are,
500 gold.

1573
01:41:00,190 --> 01:41:03,074
MATT: He collects it and ushers over the other
Bastion, who comes over and takes off your

1574
01:41:03,074 --> 01:41:07,160
manacles and escorts you to the door and says,
"However, if I see either of you two causing any

1575
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:12,477
"trouble anywhere in Vasselheim, it's down to the
oubliette you go, you hear me?"

1576
01:41:12,599 --> 01:41:15,643
SAM: Say that word again? What? Oubliette?

1577
01:41:15,643 --> 01:41:20,738
MATT: "The Amaranthine oub-lie-blah-bloo. What is wrong
with me? Get out of here! Run!"

1578
01:41:20,738 --> 01:41:22,012
(laughter)

1579
01:41:22,012 --> 01:41:25,208
SAM: You've been bested. (laughs)

1580
01:41:25,208 --> 01:41:30,679
MATT: You've out-talked the talker as the guard
finds himself so flustered by the frustration and

1581
01:41:30,679 --> 01:41:36,204
anger that he's been caused by this entire strange
arrival of individuals, his speech pattern has

1582
01:41:36,204 --> 01:41:41,388
been muddled, and in frustration shoves both of
you out the front door and slams it behind you.

1583
01:41:41,388 --> 01:41:43,275
ORION: As I leave, he's speaking Draconian!

1584
01:41:43,275 --> 01:41:45,738
SAM: I think he's having an aneurysm.

1585
01:41:45,738 --> 01:41:47,691
ORION: He's speaking Draconian! I heard him.

1586
01:41:47,691 --> 01:41:51,326
LAURA: You guys! What were you trying to do? Cast
magic?

1587
01:41:51,326 --> 01:41:57,041
ORION: She casted heal and I tried to talk her out
of it, and I just got arrested, too.

1588
01:41:57,041 --> 01:41:59,618
SAM: Thank goodness you are being represented by
an Ace Attorney.

1589
01:41:59,618 --> 01:42:02,920
ORION: Hold it!

1590
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:09,461
LAURA: He won! Let's go get your winnings, because
I think that should cover the amount I just spent

1591
01:42:09,461 --> 01:42:10,969
on getting you out of jail.

1592
01:42:10,969 --> 01:42:12,352
MARISHA: Yes! I'm owed 20 gold!

1593
01:42:12,352 --> 01:42:14,760
TRAVIS: Tiberius, thank you for your efforts. You,
as well, Keyleth.

1594
01:42:14,891 --> 01:42:17,508
MARISHA: Oh, I'm so happy you won, Grog.

1595
01:42:17,508 --> 01:42:18,376
TRAVIS: Thank you.

1596
01:42:18,376 --> 01:42:19,354
MARISHA: So happy.

1597
01:42:19,354 --> 01:42:20,913
TRAVIS: I'm the champion.

1598
01:42:20,954 --> 01:42:24,238
MARISHA: I wish I could've seen, because
I was eating my binder out of stress.

1599
01:42:24,296 --> 01:42:28,458
MATT: As you guys make your way back to the
Bellows' Respite Inn, you manage to find the one

1600
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:32,842
Bastion who acts as the bookie, who is currently
halfway through a very heavy pint and chatting

1601
01:42:32,883 --> 01:42:36,648
with one of his friends, and you can hear there are
stories now. People are retelling the tale of the

1602
01:42:36,648 --> 01:42:40,130
battle in the Cauldron of the rise of Grog the
Victorious.

1603
01:42:40,130 --> 01:42:44,684
ORION: When we're released, I would like 
to get my winnings back.

1604
01:42:44,684 --> 01:42:47,424
MATT: That's where you guys are going: to the
bookie who keeps them.

1605
01:42:47,463 --> 01:42:48,952
TRAVIS: Are we in the tavern?

1606
01:42:48,952 --> 01:42:50,704
MARISHA: Hey, Grog! They're talking about you.

1607
01:42:50,704 --> 01:42:52,495
MATT: You guys are now in the Bellows' Respite,
yes.

1608
01:42:52,495 --> 01:42:56,876
TRAVIS: Are there any small lads running about or
maybe excited to see me or something?

1609
01:42:56,876 --> 01:43:02,244
MATT: As you guys enter the tavern, there is a
sudden bit of whispered quiet. "Shh! There he is!"

1610
01:43:02,244 --> 01:43:06,342
And all the tales fall to an end and the place
falls quiet as everyone stares at you as you

1611
01:43:06,342 --> 01:43:10,179
enter. (heavy footstep sounds) Stepping in.

1612
01:43:10,179 --> 01:43:12,593
TRAVIS: Are there any younger men that are--

1613
01:43:12,593 --> 01:43:18,621
MATT: (shushing noises) There are maybe two men
looking like late teens to early twenties

1614
01:43:18,621 --> 01:43:25,105
who saw the fight and are currently like wide
doe-eyed, seeing a hero before them.

1615
01:43:25,105 --> 01:43:29,908
TRAVIS: I walk over to one of them and I pull out
a gold coin and I say, how would you like to make

1616
01:43:29,908 --> 01:43:31,491
a gold coin, son?

1617
01:43:31,491 --> 01:43:32,753
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

1618
01:43:32,753 --> 01:43:34,091
TRAVIS: Wait!

1619
01:43:34,091 --> 01:43:39,400
MATT: "From you, Grog the Victorious? Of course!
What can I do?"

1620
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:44,569
TRAVIS: I reach into the Bag of Holding. I take
out the second-place medal, the participant medal,

1621
01:43:44,569 --> 01:43:46,903
and I go, make sure Kern gets this.

1622
01:43:46,903 --> 01:43:49,521
(laughter)

1623
01:43:49,521 --> 01:43:53,775
MATT: He reads it. (chuckles) "Yes. Yes, indeed.
Of course." And he runs off.

1624
01:43:53,775 --> 01:43:55,199
TRAVIS: You sick fucks!

1625
01:43:55,199 --> 01:43:57,308
(laughter)

1626
01:43:57,308 --> 01:44:01,284
SAM: Well, I mean, come on. You came into a bar
looking for young boys.

1627
01:44:01,284 --> 01:44:02,974
What was I supposed to think?

1628
01:44:02,974 --> 01:44:07,865
MARISHA: We're together now. We're not arrested
anymore. You don't have to keep doing this. All

1629
01:44:07,865 --> 01:44:11,019
right! To Grog the Victorious!

1630
01:44:11,019 --> 01:44:12,881
ALL: To Grog!

1631
01:44:12,881 --> 01:44:16,281
MATT: The bookie gives you your coin purse of 20
gold.

1632
01:44:16,281 --> 01:44:20,352
MARISHA: You guys, this really makes gambling so
much fun.

1633
01:44:20,352 --> 01:44:22,302
SAM: Don't make a habit of it.

1634
01:44:22,302 --> 01:44:28,279
MATT: Tiberius, you get your coin purse of 2,448.

1635
01:44:28,279 --> 01:44:29,709
ORION: Great, wonderful.

1636
01:44:29,709 --> 01:44:31,539
TALIESIN: But you owe--

1637
01:44:31,539 --> 01:44:33,324
ORION: No, she's paying for that.

1638
01:44:33,324 --> 01:44:35,343
LAURA and TALIESIN: She's got 20 gold.

1639
01:44:35,343 --> 01:44:36,783
ORION: She had other gold.

1640
01:44:36,783 --> 01:44:39,220
MARISHA: I bought a nice meal for you the other
night.

1641
01:44:39,220 --> 01:44:41,533
LAURA: That's true. She bought a couple of nice
meals for you.

1642
01:44:41,533 --> 01:44:43,144
ORION: Oh, shit! That's right. I'll pay you.

1643
01:44:43,144 --> 01:44:44,722
SAM: I lost 100 gold.

1644
01:44:44,722 --> 01:44:45,803
ORION: What was it? 24?

1645
01:44:45,803 --> 01:44:47,443
MATT: 2,448 was the number.

1646
01:44:47,443 --> 01:44:49,089
LAURA: So I guess I broke even.

1647
01:44:49,089 --> 01:44:50,494
TALIESIN: You still netted a profit.

1648
01:44:50,494 --> 01:44:57,044
MATT: If you want to take the 500 from that,
(mutters quietly) minus 500... 1,948.

1649
01:44:57,044 --> 01:44:58,584
SAM: That fight was amazing.

1650
01:44:58,584 --> 01:44:59,951
MARISHA: That was fantastic.

1651
01:44:59,951 --> 01:45:05,442
MATT: I was going to say, as you guys celebrate
with a joyous drink of ale here at the Bellows'

1652
01:45:05,442 --> 01:45:09,563
Respite Inn to celebrate the victory of not
Philip, but Grog the Victorious in the Cauldron

1653
01:45:09,563 --> 01:45:18,755
here in the Braving Grounds of Vasselheim in the
northwestern region of the countryside, we will go

1654
01:45:18,755 --> 01:45:22,628
and take a quick restroom break, return here in
about five minutes. See you guys here shortly.

1655
01:45:22,628 --> 01:45:24,358
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1656
01:45:24,358 --> 01:58:18,756
[break]

1657
01:58:18,806 --> 01:58:22,178
MATT: Welcome back, guys. Welcome back! We are
returning as the party has finished their

1658
01:58:22,178 --> 01:58:28,870
celebration, drinking hard through the afternoon,
celebrating Grog's victory at the Crucible.

1659
01:58:28,870 --> 01:58:40,385
LIAM: Was that amazing, or was that amazing? I've
never seen anything like that, at all! Cheers to

1660
01:58:40,385 --> 01:58:42,169
you, big man.

1661
01:58:42,169 --> 01:58:43,273
TRAVIS: Thanks, bud.

1662
01:58:43,273 --> 01:58:44,522
SAM: L'chaim!

1663
01:58:44,522 --> 01:58:45,650
MARISHA and LAURA: Cheers!

1664
01:58:45,650 --> 01:58:46,827
ORION: I raise my glass of water and cheers, as
well.

1665
01:58:46,827 --> 01:58:47,947
TRAVIS: Thank you, Tiberius.

1666
01:58:47,947 --> 01:58:49,621
MATT: Y'all enjoy our applesauce.

1667
01:58:49,621 --> 01:58:51,678
TRAVIS: Or glass of water.

1668
01:58:51,678 --> 01:58:53,119
MATT: Apple juice.

1669
01:58:53,119 --> 01:58:54,482
LAURA: Good apple juice.

1670
01:58:54,482 --> 01:58:55,772
MATT: Very good apple juice.

1671
01:58:55,772 --> 01:58:58,387
TALIESIN: Be gentle with that. Apples don't grow
on trees.

1672
01:58:58,387 --> 01:59:00,644
LIAM: This episode of Critical Role brought to you
by Mott's!

1673
01:59:00,644 --> 01:59:11,283
MATT: Mott's Irish apple juice. All right! With
that bit of business with the Crucible currently

1674
01:59:11,283 --> 01:59:15,636
taken care of, the rest of your path is your own.
What do you wish to do?

1675
01:59:15,636 --> 01:59:20,777
LAURA: (stuttering) Money? Kraghammer?

1676
01:59:20,777 --> 01:59:22,635
TALIESIN: Emon by way of Kraghammer.

1677
01:59:22,635 --> 01:59:25,182
MARISHA: Is there anything else we want to do
while we're here?

1678
01:59:25,182 --> 01:59:26,550
ORION: No!

1679
01:59:26,550 --> 01:59:28,774
MARISHA: Are we over this town? Over this city?

1680
01:59:28,774 --> 01:59:33,206
TALIESIN: I just need to pick up a little bit of
ore on the way out so I can work on making some

1681
01:59:33,206 --> 01:59:35,072
more ammunition on the way to Kraghammer.

1682
01:59:35,072 --> 01:59:41,452
ORION: I like that idea. We could take the airship
and you could craft some things. When we do go, I

1683
01:59:41,452 --> 01:59:45,748
think I might have an idea for our carpet
situation.

1684
01:59:45,748 --> 01:59:46,835
SAM: Oh?!

1685
01:59:46,835 --> 01:59:47,715
MARISHA: Really?

1686
01:59:47,715 --> 01:59:49,037
SAM: Your Wheel of Mending, perhaps?

1687
01:59:49,037 --> 01:59:50,353
ORION: No, that didn't work.

1688
01:59:50,353 --> 01:59:51,873
LIAM: We tried that. It didn't work.

1689
01:59:51,873 --> 01:59:58,374
ORION: It kept it intact. But when we return to
House Thunderbrand, I believe we have a few items

1690
01:59:58,374 --> 02:00:05,400
that they want. The deal was when we procure
certain items, we will be allowed to have certain

1691
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:14,615
information and certain-- we didn't explain what
we were going to get. But we should return, get

1692
02:00:14,615 --> 02:00:17,289
our gold, and definitely visit House
Thunderbrand.

1693
02:00:17,289 --> 02:00:19,426
LAURA: Right. 'Cause they have magic things.

1694
02:00:19,426 --> 02:00:23,718
ORION: They are strongly arcane. Perhaps they can
enchant for what we have procured for them in

1695
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:28,515
that venture. And maybe that could be a good way
of getting around getting our carpet re-enchanted

1696
02:00:28,555 --> 02:00:30,185
without costing any coin.

1697
02:00:30,185 --> 02:00:31,479
TALIESIN: We'll prod that.

1698
02:00:31,479 --> 02:00:35,373
LIAM: Can they make me unsee my sister's boobies?

1699
02:00:35,373 --> 02:00:39,393
LAURA: You didn't see them! You were behind me, so
shut up. What are you doing all the

1700
02:00:39,393 --> 02:00:41,147
way over there, anyway?

1701
02:00:41,278 --> 02:00:42,558
SAM: I saw them. I saw them!

1702
02:00:42,558 --> 02:00:44,629
ORION: Scanlan? When you describe them to me?

1703
02:00:44,629 --> 02:00:46,348
SAM: I will draw them in great detail.

1704
02:00:46,348 --> 02:00:47,276
ORION: Thank you.

1705
02:00:47,276 --> 02:00:48,520
MARISHA: I wasn't there, either!

1706
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:49,591
LAURA: How about no?

1707
02:00:49,591 --> 02:00:57,301
TALIESIN: In great details of the internet. Just
saying. I went there. It was already there.

1708
02:00:57,301 --> 02:01:02,557
LAURA: I was caught up in a moment of passion! I'm
sorry!

1709
02:01:02,557 --> 02:01:04,507
TALIESIN: Too late!

1710
02:01:04,507 --> 02:01:07,127
SAM: She would do anything for you, Grog!

1711
02:01:07,127 --> 02:01:09,938
LAURA: Anything for you and for the 600 gold that
that I put on your fight.

1712
02:01:09,938 --> 02:01:11,460
SAM: Oh, it was for the money!

1713
02:01:11,460 --> 02:01:15,241
LIAM: Listen, I was right there. There was no
other way around that situation.

1714
02:01:15,241 --> 02:01:17,433
TALIESIN: You did what you had to.

1715
02:01:17,433 --> 02:01:21,827
SAM: Listen. I would show any part of me for,
like, two gold.

1716
02:01:21,827 --> 02:01:23,282
TRAVIS: Here's two gold.

1717
02:01:23,282 --> 02:01:26,683
SAM: Here, take a look at my third nipple!

1718
02:01:26,683 --> 02:01:28,639
LAURA: On your body?

1719
02:01:28,639 --> 02:01:31,462
SAM: It can be wherever I put it, really. It's
magical.

1720
02:01:31,462 --> 02:01:34,402
ORION: It's a piece of gum!

1721
02:01:34,402 --> 02:01:39,493
LIAM: I have no idea what's going on.

1722
02:01:39,493 --> 02:01:42,627
SAM: We're all together. That's what's going on.

1723
02:01:42,627 --> 02:01:44,370
MARISHA: I love this tavern.

1724
02:01:44,370 --> 02:01:48,131
ORION: What is closer to Kraghammer? Emon? Or
where we're from?

1725
02:01:48,131 --> 02:01:51,717
TALIESIN: It's halfway. I think Kraghammer is in
between us and Emon.

1726
02:01:51,717 --> 02:01:56,744
MATT: No. Actually, from where you guys are
currently, across the Ozmit Sea is Emon, which is

1727
02:01:56,744 --> 02:02:01,149
the port city in Tal'Dorei, and then Kraghammer is
maybe two days' travel.

1728
02:02:01,208 --> 02:02:03,149
LAURA: So we gotta stop into Emon first.

1729
02:02:03,203 --> 02:02:04,783
ORION: Oh, that's fine. Are we all ready to go?

1730
02:02:04,783 --> 02:02:05,826
MARISHA: What time is it?

1731
02:02:05,826 --> 02:02:09,112
MATT: By now, I'd say it's probably 1:00 in the
afternoon, since that fight's happened.

1732
02:02:09,112 --> 02:02:10,524
MARISHA: Y'all, we're day drunk!

1733
02:02:10,524 --> 02:02:11,762
ORION: Are we ready to go?

1734
02:02:11,762 --> 02:02:13,314
TRAVIS: We're getting ore, right?

1735
02:02:13,314 --> 02:02:15,301
MARISHA: We're celebrating Grog, right?

1736
02:02:15,301 --> 02:02:16,675
TRAVIS: Doesn't Percy want ore?

1737
02:02:16,675 --> 02:02:20,660
TALIESIN: It's not hard to get a little bit of
ore. I'm just going to pick up some.

1738
02:02:20,660 --> 02:02:25,182
ORION: After that, are we ready to go?

1739
02:02:25,182 --> 02:02:33,137
SAM: Well, maybe. There's two more things that I
have unanswered questions for. First of all, you

1740
02:02:33,137 --> 02:02:37,266
said we were going to stop on the way to get a new
carpet or to get our carpet repaired?

1741
02:02:37,266 --> 02:02:41,171
ORION: We need to go to Kraghammer to collect our
30,000 gold waiting for us.

1742
02:02:41,171 --> 02:02:42,913
LAURA: 25,000.

1743
02:02:42,913 --> 02:02:49,677
ORION: 25,000, sorry. While we're there, House
Thunderbrand. We've procured a few items, or at

1744
02:02:49,677 --> 02:02:56,236
least one, while we were down in the Underdark. We
should return there and talk to them and perhaps

1745
02:02:56,236 --> 02:03:00,386
in exchange for gold, perhaps have them enchant the
carpet to fly again.

1746
02:03:00,386 --> 02:03:07,633
SAM: That is a smart idea. That's great. Before we
leave though, does anyone have a nagging, tugging

1747
02:03:07,674 --> 02:03:14,448
feeling about that cloaked human who praised your
performance? Should we investigate that at all?

1748
02:03:14,448 --> 02:03:17,150
TRAVIS: He had a lovely beard!

1749
02:03:17,150 --> 02:03:22,232
SAM: Well, that makes something. Could we at least
find out who he was before we leave town?

1750
02:03:22,232 --> 02:03:24,031
LAURA: Oh, bartender!

1751
02:03:24,031 --> 02:03:29,550
MATT: At which point, you see off to the side
Once-Lucky Ned, the barkeep, looks over.

1752
02:03:29,550 --> 02:03:32,227
"Yes, yes? You have a question?"

1753
02:03:32,227 --> 02:03:37,525
LAURA: Yes. That bearded, hooded gentleman at the
end of the fight, yeah?

1754
02:03:37,525 --> 02:03:41,733
MATT: Thinks for a second. "Oh, you mean--"

1755
02:03:41,733 --> 02:03:43,655
LAURA: The one that everyone was quiet for.

1756
02:03:43,655 --> 02:03:44,981
MARISHA: The red and gold robes.

1757
02:03:44,981 --> 02:03:47,124
LAURA: What? Who? Who is he?

1758
02:03:47,124 --> 02:03:49,746
MATT: "You're certainly not from around here, are
you?"

1759
02:03:49,746 --> 02:03:50,868
LAURA: I'm not.

1760
02:03:50,868 --> 02:03:55,292
MATT: Looks around. "That was Earthbreaker
Groon."

1761
02:03:55,292 --> 02:03:56,858
SAM: Earthbaker Groon?

1762
02:03:56,858 --> 02:03:57,954
MATT: "Earthbreaker Groon."

1763
02:03:57,954 --> 02:04:00,531
ALL: Earthbreaker Groon.

1764
02:04:00,531 --> 02:04:02,043
TRAVIS: That's a great name!

1765
02:04:02,043 --> 02:04:03,860
ORION: Where does he hail from?

1766
02:04:03,860 --> 02:04:08,964
MATT: "He's the Dawn Marshal of the entirety of
these here Braving Grounds."

1767
02:04:08,964 --> 02:04:11,167
MARISHA: Dawn Marshal?

1768
02:04:11,216 --> 02:04:18,624
MATT: "He's the Dawn Marshal. He is the highest
esteemed cleric of the church of Kord, the Trial

1769
02:04:18,624 --> 02:04:26,739
"Forge itself, in the center of this city, this
portion, this district. Well, he is the very top

1770
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:30,340
"of the entire hierarchy underneath Kord's strength
and watch."

1771
02:04:30,340 --> 02:04:32,207
LAURA: And he nodded!

1772
02:04:32,207 --> 02:04:38,473
MATT: "Apparently, he was summoned to watch this
fight and approved of your prowess in battle."

1773
02:04:38,473 --> 02:04:39,821
LAURA: What does that mean?

1774
02:04:39,821 --> 02:04:41,347
MATT: "I have no fucking clue!"

1775
02:04:41,347 --> 02:04:42,892
(laughter)

1776
02:04:42,892 --> 02:04:45,318
MATT: "But that's an honor is what that is, and
appreciate that yourself."

1777
02:04:45,318 --> 02:04:50,658
TRAVIS: Aye, and I do. If I wanted to find this
Earthbreaker Groom--

1778
02:04:50,658 --> 02:04:53,329
MATT: "Groon. With an N."

1779
02:04:53,329 --> 02:04:57,091
TRAVIS: Oh. Groon. Right. The other one's weird.
Would I find him in the

1780
02:04:57,091 --> 02:04:59,151
middle of the Trial Forge?

1781
02:04:59,151 --> 02:05:00,456
MATT: "Most likely."

1782
02:05:00,456 --> 02:05:04,011
MARISHA: So this guy's like the Pope of Kord?

1783
02:05:04,011 --> 02:05:06,084
MATT: "Pope?"

1784
02:05:06,084 --> 02:05:13,910
ORION: What is a Pope? It's okay. She's young.
Thank you for the information.

1785
02:05:13,910 --> 02:05:15,214
MARISHA: I'm foreign!

1786
02:05:15,214 --> 02:05:17,492
ORION: And foreign. Have a good day.

1787
02:05:17,492 --> 02:05:18,732
MATT: "Thank you."

1788
02:05:18,732 --> 02:05:20,174
TALIESIN: And has antlers on her head.

1789
02:05:20,174 --> 02:05:21,475
ORION: I think we should all leave.

1790
02:05:21,475 --> 02:05:22,769
MARISHA: I like my antlers.

1791
02:05:22,769 --> 02:05:24,017
TALIESIN: I like your antlers.

1792
02:05:24,017 --> 02:05:25,468
MARISHA: What's wrong with my antlers?

1793
02:05:25,468 --> 02:05:27,671
TALIESIN: There's nothing. It's just a very
reasonable reason not to take you too seriously.

1794
02:05:27,671 --> 02:05:28,614
ORION: Scanlan?

1795
02:05:28,614 --> 02:05:30,408
SAM: Yes? Yes, Tiberius, my good friend?

1796
02:05:30,408 --> 02:05:35,666
ORION: Are you satisfied in your knowledge you've
procured?

1797
02:05:35,666 --> 02:05:37,177
SAM: I'm always satisfied.

1798
02:05:37,177 --> 02:05:40,817
(laughter)

1799
02:05:40,817 --> 02:05:42,196
ORION: Wonderful!

1800
02:05:42,196 --> 02:05:43,591
TRAVIS: Too easy. Too easy!

1801
02:05:43,591 --> 02:05:50,814
ORION: Grog, I'm sure you would like to... go to a
pub of sorts?

1802
02:05:50,814 --> 02:05:52,402
LAURA and MARISHA: We're in a pub!

1803
02:05:52,402 --> 02:05:53,452
ORION: Oh, fuck!

1804
02:05:53,452 --> 02:05:54,707
MARISHA: We're day drunk!

1805
02:05:54,707 --> 02:05:56,061
SAM: That's how drunk we are!

1806
02:05:56,061 --> 02:05:57,354
ORION: Shit!

1807
02:05:57,354 --> 02:06:00,319
TALIESIN: I have a brilliant, if slightly
inebriated, thought.

1808
02:06:00,319 --> 02:06:01,771
ORION: I walk out of the bar.

1809
02:06:01,771 --> 02:06:03,030
MATT: Okay.

1810
02:06:03,030 --> 02:06:05,941
TALIESIN: I have an even better brilliant, yet slightly
inebriated thought.

1811
02:06:05,941 --> 02:06:08,474
SAM: Oh, I think I saw Tiberius fall over.

1812
02:06:08,512 --> 02:06:11,944
MARISHA: Oh, is Tiberius puking? Oh...

1813
02:06:11,944 --> 02:06:13,788
LAURA: What is it, Percy?

1814
02:06:13,788 --> 02:06:22,499
TALIESIN: My thought is I can probably find some
of the ore I need to procure at the same time that

1815
02:06:22,499 --> 02:06:27,326
we find this Groon fellow, and at the very least,
you can strike up a quick conversation with him.

1816
02:06:27,326 --> 02:06:31,203
LAURA: Would you like me to go with you, Grog, as
your manager?

1817
02:06:31,203 --> 02:06:33,929
TRAVIS: I would actually like both the twins to go
with.

1818
02:06:33,929 --> 02:06:36,390
SAM: Grog, would you like any young boys to
accompany you?

1819
02:06:36,390 --> 02:06:38,307
(laughter)

1820
02:06:38,307 --> 02:06:41,400
TALIESIN: You can give them a medal!

1821
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:43,166
TRAVIS: No.

1822
02:06:43,166 --> 02:06:45,602
ORION: I went back into the bar because I went to
take a piss outside.

1823
02:06:45,602 --> 02:06:48,413
LAURA: Let's go!

1824
02:06:48,413 --> 02:06:50,130
MARISHA: Wait, where're we going?

1825
02:06:50,130 --> 02:06:51,073
ORION: What is going on?

1826
02:06:51,073 --> 02:06:53,187
LAURA: You guys are recovering from your drink.

1827
02:06:53,187 --> 02:06:54,413
ORION: Hold on a second.

1828
02:06:54,413 --> 02:06:55,319
MARISHA: No!

1829
02:06:55,319 --> 02:06:56,998
ORION: I've had plenty of water.

1830
02:06:56,998 --> 02:06:58,264
TALIESIN: You're already been arrested today.

1831
02:06:58,264 --> 02:07:02,471
ORION: I'm fine! (slurred) Scanlan has been
ordering me water for the whole time

1832
02:07:02,471 --> 02:07:03,994
has been cleared.

1833
02:07:03,994 --> 02:07:07,590
MARISHA: That's right! I have already been
arrested today, but I did get better.

1834
02:07:07,590 --> 02:07:15,563
MATT: All right, so you guys are going with Percy
to procure materials for forging new ammunition?

1835
02:07:15,563 --> 02:07:17,012
TALIESIN: Yes.

1836
02:07:17,012 --> 02:07:19,111
MATT: All right, go ahead and make an
investigation check.

1837
02:07:19,111 --> 02:07:24,694
TALIESIN: What happened to my dice? Okay. 14.

1838
02:07:24,694 --> 02:07:31,473
MATT: 14, okay. It takes you roughly 30 minutes or
so. Thankfully, this region itself contains...

1839
02:07:31,473 --> 02:07:36,577
honestly, most of the smithing-based materials
and/or workshops they required. The difficult part

1840
02:07:36,577 --> 02:07:45,485
is finding black powder. It is not refined in this
region. It's usually considered almost a byproduct

1841
02:07:45,485 --> 02:07:52,203
of some of the mining and smelting, and it's very
rare to find. Eventually, you find one smithy that

1842
02:07:52,203 --> 02:07:57,808
gathers it. You're not entirely certain why. And
after you give people a couple of examples of the

1843
02:07:57,808 --> 02:08:01,439
smell of it and what to look for, people send you
in this one direction. And you're sent to this one

1844
02:08:01,439 --> 02:08:06,580
small hovel that is attached to the very base of
the mountain that overlooks the entirety of the

1845
02:08:06,580 --> 02:08:13,089
city, on the far northwestern edge of the Braving
Grounds. You come to the door, and it's a very

1846
02:08:13,089 --> 02:08:18,366
simple, slovenly-kept house. The wood itself is a
little warped from the weather; it hasn't kept

1847
02:08:18,366 --> 02:08:24,297
well, and there's a musty smell of mildew from the
outside of the building. But you see a slight glow

1848
02:08:24,297 --> 02:08:27,224
between the cracks. Apparently, there is some sort
of interior light.

1849
02:08:27,224 --> 02:08:30,789
TALIESIN: Hello?

1850
02:08:30,789 --> 02:08:32,147
MATT: "Yes?"

1851
02:08:32,147 --> 02:08:40,593
TALIESIN: Charming. My name is Percival
Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski De Rolo III.

1852
02:08:40,593 --> 02:08:41,972
SAM: Huzzah!

1853
02:08:41,972 --> 02:08:48,921
TALIESIN: Thank you. I was sent here in terms to
hopefully negotiate the purchase of some black

1854
02:08:48,921 --> 02:08:50,424
powder? I heard--

1855
02:08:50,424 --> 02:08:54,028
MATT: The door slams open at this point,
mid-sentence, and you see from around the corner a

1856
02:08:54,028 --> 02:09:02,083
very lithe, crooked-looking man. Quite elderly,
but very spry for his size. You see his arms and

1857
02:09:02,136 --> 02:09:06,809
legs are very lanky and almost spider-like in the
way they move and shift as he peeks out. And you

1858
02:09:06,860 --> 02:09:10,624
can see he has spectacles of two different sizes
and thicknesses around each eye. His hair is

1859
02:09:10,624 --> 02:09:15,197
frazzled and gray and white, and he goes, "Yes?!
You said you need black powder? Yes, yes, come in,

1860
02:09:15,197 --> 02:09:17,672
"come in!" And he runs back into the hovel.

1861
02:09:17,672 --> 02:09:19,773
TALIESIN: I gingerly enter.

1862
02:09:19,773 --> 02:09:26,603
MATT: As you step inside, the scent hits you
immediately, and you realize this place is

1863
02:09:26,603 --> 02:09:31,385
probably filled with black powder. And the last
thing anyone wants is to set off any sort of

1864
02:09:31,385 --> 02:09:35,393
flame. This would be a very bad idea. And as you
look around, your eyes adjust to the low-lit

1865
02:09:35,393 --> 02:09:43,591
interior. You realize it's low-lit because there
are two very, very faintly set magical torch

1866
02:09:43,591 --> 02:09:46,187
sconces on each side that are very, very low
light.

1867
02:09:46,187 --> 02:09:48,780
LAURA: Very similar to the ones surrounding you.

1868
02:09:48,780 --> 02:09:52,970
MATT: Kind of like these, but even smaller! And
you can see in the room, there is a small forge

1869
02:09:52,970 --> 02:09:54,551
that's in disuse to the far end.

1870
02:09:54,551 --> 02:09:56,175
TALIESIN: I would hope so!

1871
02:09:56,175 --> 02:10:02,436
MATT: There are a large, large, <i>large</i> number of
crates and barrels that all seem to be containing

1872
02:10:02,436 --> 02:10:09,551
various parts of discarded gravel. Basically,
whatever is shoved off of any mining expedition

1873
02:10:09,551 --> 02:10:15,069
goes to him and he just shuffles through it and
separates in different pieces. And there's barrels

1874
02:10:15,069 --> 02:10:23,233
full of sulfur, barrels full of what looks like
broken onyx or broken quartz, and they've all been

1875
02:10:23,233 --> 02:10:27,581
separated. And you can see now this is his OCD
collection. And there is, indeed, at the far end

1876
02:10:27,581 --> 02:10:33,823
what looks to be a barrel that contains a large
amount of black powder that is just everywhere.

1877
02:10:33,823 --> 02:10:38,260
It's like this very fine coat of powder that is
encompassing this entire room. And as he turns

1878
02:10:38,260 --> 02:10:42,710
around, you can see now his hands themselves are
black and coated in it. And he goes, "So! You came

1879
02:10:42,710 --> 02:10:47,869
"looking for black powder, did you? No one asks
about the black powder, but I knew it had a

1880
02:10:47,869 --> 02:10:51,432
"purpose! Yes! You wish to buy it?! How much do you
want?"

1881
02:10:51,432 --> 02:10:55,095
(giggling)

1882
02:10:55,095 --> 02:10:57,379
MATT: (pants heavily) "Speak up! Speak up, I
haven't all day!"

1883
02:10:57,379 --> 02:11:00,971
TALIESIN: How much for a barrel or a hogshead's
worth?

1884
02:11:00,971 --> 02:11:13,490
MATT: "For the barrel? The barrel, that'll run
you... (mutters) 4,623 gold pieces for the barrel.

1885
02:11:13,490 --> 02:11:18,175
"However, for the hogshead--" You can see now the
spittle dribbling down his chin.

1886
02:11:18,175 --> 02:11:20,663
TALIESIN: I can! It's as if I can see the spittle
myself!

1887
02:11:20,663 --> 02:11:26,379
MATT: Yes, indeed! "But! For the hogshead, which--
ooh!" And he turns around and shuffles through a

1888
02:11:26,379 --> 02:11:30,337
bunch of pieces of burlap and sacks and pulls out
what looks to be an actual dried and hollowed-out

1889
02:11:30,379 --> 02:11:38,472
hog's head. "To fill this? To fill this hog's head
with it? This'll only cost you 426 gold pieces.

1890
02:11:38,472 --> 02:11:40,868
"Yes?"

1891
02:11:40,868 --> 02:11:46,960
TALIESIN: How about 400 even, and you can direct
me to some ore, as well?

1892
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:50,534
MATT: "Ore? I do not work in ore."

1893
02:11:50,534 --> 02:11:53,824
TALIESIN: I thought you might have a friend.

1894
02:11:53,824 --> 02:11:55,177
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

1895
02:11:55,177 --> 02:11:56,482
TRAVIS: Nice, Percy.

1896
02:11:56,482 --> 02:11:58,694
LIAM: Look at that, he slipped right into Mercer
there.

1897
02:11:58,694 --> 02:12:00,344
SAM: No, that's the other character.

1898
02:12:00,344 --> 02:12:03,228
TALIESIN: I love Percy. 25.

1899
02:12:03,228 --> 02:12:04,639
MATT: 25.

1900
02:12:04,639 --> 02:12:08,112
TALIESIN: I'm sure you have a friend. You must.
You seem so amiable.

1901
02:12:08,112 --> 02:12:13,661
MATT: "400! 400 and I send you to Samson! Yes? You
take?"

1902
02:12:13,661 --> 02:12:15,766
TALIESIN: My good sir, you have a deal!

1903
02:12:15,766 --> 02:12:20,398
MATT: "Glorious!" He turns around and jams the hog
head into the barrel of black powder, picks it up.

1904
02:12:20,398 --> 02:12:25,202
(poof) The soot settles against you and the rest
of you guys as you now find yourself partially

1905
02:12:25,202 --> 02:12:30,395
covered in this slowly dissipating cloud of black
powder. (coughs) You cough instinctively and

1906
02:12:30,431 --> 02:12:33,262
push it away. "Yes. 400 gold. You pay?"

1907
02:12:33,298 --> 02:12:37,680
TALIESIN: I gingerly put the purse down in front
of me.

1908
02:12:37,680 --> 02:12:41,828
MATT: He takes it. With a whisk, it's already put
away into a side pouch, and you hear the clanging

1909
02:12:41,828 --> 02:12:49,265
of haphazard coins in his far pocket. "Here! Hog
head! Take it! (grunts) To Samson! This way!" And

1910
02:12:49,265 --> 02:12:54,237
he grabs your arm and drags you out of his hovel.
He points across the way with his shaking, crooked

1911
02:12:54,237 --> 02:13:02,446
finger. "Samson! There! In the brick building!
Tell him Victor sent you. He'll give you ore!"

1912
02:13:02,446 --> 02:13:06,665
TALIESIN: Thank you for all of your help. You've
been so kind.

1913
02:13:06,665 --> 02:13:11,451
MATT: "My pleasure. You want more powder, come
back. Yes, yes?!"

1914
02:13:11,451 --> 02:13:13,044
TALIESIN: I might do that.

1915
02:13:13,044 --> 02:13:17,462
MATT: "Good! Goodbye!" And pushes you out, takes
both of you by the arms and pushes you out, slams

1916
02:13:17,462 --> 02:13:21,783
the door behind, and you are left standing there,
half-covered in blackened soot and black powder,

1917
02:13:21,783 --> 02:13:25,169
in the center of the thoroughfare, midday, stunned
by the whole encounter.

1918
02:13:25,169 --> 02:13:27,765
TRAVIS: I mean, come on, come the fuck on!

1919
02:13:27,765 --> 02:13:30,790
SAM: Amazing. Matt's crazy prospector character.

1920
02:13:30,790 --> 02:13:37,078
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk over to Samson's place
and become very excited at the

1921
02:13:37,078 --> 02:13:39,092
prospect of a new accent.

1922
02:13:39,092 --> 02:13:43,173
LIAM: 6.2, 6.4, 6.5.

1923
02:13:43,173 --> 02:13:45,418
TALIESIN: 4.3 from the Russian judge.

1924
02:13:45,418 --> 02:13:52,315
MATT: Yeah, you walk to the distant brick
building. The bricks themselves are made of a

1925
02:13:52,315 --> 02:13:58,608
hardened, grayish clay material that's been made
in the basic construction of this. The roof itself

1926
02:13:58,608 --> 02:14:04,040
is a solid slab of stone. There is no pretty or
elegant aspect of its construction. It's merely

1927
02:14:04,040 --> 02:14:09,219
built here for purpose. The door is partially
ajar, and as you peek in you can see there is a

1928
02:14:09,219 --> 02:14:15,191
very active forge. There is a heat emanating from
the interior, and you can see there is a man who

1929
02:14:15,191 --> 02:14:19,093
is currently hammering something away at what
looks like an anvil set outside in front of it.

1930
02:14:19,093 --> 02:14:22,851
(metal clanging)

1931
02:14:22,890 --> 02:14:25,303
"Yes?"

1932
02:14:25,303 --> 02:14:27,893
TALIESIN: Mr. Samson?

1933
02:14:27,893 --> 02:14:29,211
MATT: "Yes?"

1934
02:14:29,211 --> 02:14:35,555
TALIESIN: The strange fellow down the road sent me
to you. He said you might have some ore?

1935
02:14:35,555 --> 02:14:41,452
MATT: (heavy sigh) The head sinks into the
shoulders with a sigh. "All right. If you dealt

1936
02:14:41,452 --> 02:14:45,954
"with that crazy old coot, at the very least I can
offer you a brief conversation. Hold on just a

1937
02:14:45,954 --> 02:14:50,372
"second!" (grunts) And you see he takes this visor
off the front of his face and sets it down and

1938
02:14:50,372 --> 02:14:57,855
removes these big leather gloves and this leather
apron of sorts and puts it to the side, and he

1939
02:14:57,855 --> 02:15:01,694
wipes his brow as he steps over. And you can see
him now. He's a man in his late twenties.

1940
02:15:01,694 --> 02:15:07,381
Muscle-bound, a little thick around the waist,
barrel-chested. A little bit of scruff on his

1941
02:15:07,381 --> 02:15:15,732
chin, but nothing beyond not having time for
upkeep and focused on his work. He steps up. "So

1942
02:15:15,732 --> 02:15:17,490
"what did the old coot tell you, anyway?"

1943
02:15:17,490 --> 02:15:21,725
TALIESIN: He said you might have some raw ore for
sale that I might purchase. You'll excuse me if I

1944
02:15:21,725 --> 02:15:24,005
don't come in; I'm covered in explosive powder.

1945
02:15:24,005 --> 02:15:29,937
MATT: "No, please. Stay there. For the love of
Kord, stay on that doorstep. Do not step into my

1946
02:15:29,937 --> 02:15:31,272
"abode, please."

1947
02:15:31,272 --> 02:15:32,556
TALIESIN: Of course.

1948
02:15:32,556 --> 02:15:33,450
MATT: "Please."

1949
02:15:33,450 --> 02:15:34,958
TALIESIN: No. Yes.

1950
02:15:34,958 --> 02:15:39,082
MATT: "Please. All right. What ore are you
interested in?"

1951
02:15:39,082 --> 02:15:43,585
TALIESIN: Just some iron ore. Actually, I have a
little invention which sends projectiles

1952
02:15:43,585 --> 02:15:44,699
at great speed.

1953
02:15:44,699 --> 02:15:50,802
MATT: "That sounds fascinating. I have ore for
sale. Raw ore-- would you like ingots? I prepare

1954
02:15:50,802 --> 02:15:54,620
"ingots. They're a little more expensive, but
they're proper and ready for any sort of use as

1955
02:15:54,620 --> 02:15:55,941
"blacksmithing materials."

1956
02:15:55,941 --> 02:15:57,900
TALIESIN: Ingots would be preferable, yes.

1957
02:15:57,900 --> 02:15:59,992
MATT: "All right, how many are you looking for?
Five, ten, 20?"

1958
02:15:59,992 --> 02:16:03,523
TALIESIN: What could you give me for approximately
a thousand gold's worth?

1959
02:16:03,523 --> 02:16:12,191
MATT: He gives you an arched eyebrow in surprise.
"I mean, I only have about 200 pounds of iron

1960
02:16:12,191 --> 02:16:13,771
"ingots at the ready."

1961
02:16:13,771 --> 02:16:15,689
TALIESIN: I certainly can't carry that much with
me right now.

1962
02:16:15,689 --> 02:16:17,503
Let's say about a hundred pounds' worth?

1963
02:16:17,503 --> 02:16:23,665
MATT: "A hundred pounds of iron ingots. I could
sell it to you. Let's set the price at about 400

1964
02:16:23,665 --> 02:16:24,565
"gold pieces."

1965
02:16:24,565 --> 02:16:26,763
LAURA: Ugh, haggle him down. I'm not there.

1966
02:16:26,763 --> 02:16:33,134
LIAM: But in the back of his head, he hears
your voice. We all do, at this point.

1967
02:16:33,311 --> 02:16:41,483
TALIESIN: Let's say 350 gold, and I promise to
always shower twice before entering your home for

1968
02:16:41,483 --> 02:16:43,123
my next purchase.

1969
02:16:43,123 --> 02:16:45,161
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

1970
02:16:45,161 --> 02:16:46,543
TALIESIN: All right.

1971
02:16:46,543 --> 02:16:50,386
SAM: Pointless haggle. I love it. Best part of
the show.

1972
02:16:50,386 --> 02:16:52,235
MARISHA: I wish I were Percy.

1973
02:16:52,235 --> 02:16:53,350
TALIESIN: 24.

1974
02:16:53,350 --> 02:17:03,478
MATT: 24? He goes, "You drive a hard bargain.
However, underneath all that soot, I can see you

1975
02:17:03,478 --> 02:17:09,008
"dress well, at the very least. A bit tattered
around the edges... I'd like future business, so

1976
02:17:09,008 --> 02:17:14,416
"350 and take the ingots, and please do shower next
time."

1977
02:17:14,416 --> 02:17:20,752
TALIESIN: Of course. You are a gentleman, and
apparently a worthy smith, as well. I do bid you

1978
02:17:20,752 --> 02:17:21,990
good day, then.

1979
02:17:21,990 --> 02:17:26,607
MATT: "I've already completed the transaction.
Flattery is not required." He reaches over and

1980
02:17:26,607 --> 02:17:32,088
settles into a large, triple-bagged sack of
ingots. He gets partway through and goes, "Nah,

1981
02:17:32,088 --> 02:17:37,811
"this is cart-worthy." He sets it up on a small
cart and brings it over to you. And it's a small,

1982
02:17:37,811 --> 02:17:43,351
wheeled wooden cart. It looks really rickety and
probably about to collapse, but he does not charge

1983
02:17:43,351 --> 02:17:46,430
you for it. It can be hand-carried if need be.

1984
02:17:46,430 --> 02:17:49,653
TALIESIN: Good man, I will see you when my need
arises again.

1985
02:17:49,653 --> 02:17:52,233
MATT: "I look forward to it. Remember: bathed!"

1986
02:17:52,275 --> 02:17:55,403
TALIESIN: Very bathed. In fact, quite bathed.

1987
02:17:55,403 --> 02:18:05,740
MATT: "Seriously. Bathed. Please. All right, we're
good. Thank you." And he closes the door. All

1988
02:18:05,740 --> 02:18:08,948
right. You guys?

1989
02:18:08,948 --> 02:18:11,214
TRAVIS: We're going to see Earthbreaker...

1990
02:18:11,214 --> 02:18:12,763
SAM and LAURA: Earthbreaker Groon!

1991
02:18:12,763 --> 02:18:15,452
MATT: All right. Make your way to the outskirts of
the Trial Forge.

1992
02:18:15,452 --> 02:18:17,553
ORION: We know who he is. Do we need to pursue
this guy?

1993
02:18:17,553 --> 02:18:19,147
LAURA: Just to talk to him, because he likes
Grog.

1994
02:18:19,147 --> 02:18:21,508
MARISHA: I mean, we can stay and keep getting
day-drunk.

1995
02:18:21,508 --> 02:18:23,898
SAM: Why don't you just go get arrested again?

1996
02:18:23,898 --> 02:18:27,812
MARISHA: Hey, that hurts, Scanlan.

1997
02:18:27,812 --> 02:18:30,784
TALIESIN: I'm going to come back and join you.

1998
02:18:30,784 --> 02:18:36,571
ORION: I'm going to do a daily roll for my pet
because I'm going to try to teach a trick, and I

1999
02:18:36,571 --> 02:18:37,682
rolled a 15.

2000
02:18:37,682 --> 02:18:39,904
MATT: Okay. Trying to teach it a trick?

2001
02:18:39,904 --> 02:18:46,740
ORION: Yeah. At the end of the-- does it just
build up points today and then try...

2002
02:18:46,740 --> 02:18:48,328
MATT: What kind of trick are you teaching?

2003
02:18:48,328 --> 02:18:50,250
ORION: To scout!

2004
02:18:50,250 --> 02:18:54,962
MATT: To scout for you? I'd say with a 15, yeah.
You take some time, and with a small Draconian

2005
02:18:54,962 --> 02:18:59,938
command, a phrase of your choice, you teach it
that on that one phrase, it will go ahead and

2006
02:18:59,938 --> 02:19:08,549
wander ahead for a bit and then come back and
relinquish in very broken, very basic Draconic

2007
02:19:08,549 --> 02:19:13,906
language into your connection with it. Very, very
basic information on what it saw.

2008
02:19:13,906 --> 02:19:14,866
ORION: Cool.

2009
02:19:14,866 --> 02:19:17,776
SAM: I'm going to throw a Lightning Bolt spell
into my Ioun Stone.

2010
02:19:17,776 --> 02:19:19,774
MATT: Okay, so you store that. Awesome.

2011
02:19:19,774 --> 02:19:21,009
ORION: Little treat.

2012
02:19:21,009 --> 02:19:25,565
MATT: It takes it and gobbles it down happily.
Awesome. You guys make your way to the Trial

2013
02:19:25,565 --> 02:19:30,643
Forge, the large temple to Kord itself. It's once
again brilliant to behold. There are steps leading

2014
02:19:30,643 --> 02:19:35,601
up to the front area: these giant reddish, almost
rusted-over looking iron doors that block the

2015
02:19:35,601 --> 02:19:39,743
front entrance. At the very top of it, you see
looming over this entire district is a gargantuan

2016
02:19:39,743 --> 02:19:45,478
statue of Kord himself. This giant, muscle-bound
humanoid titan of a figure, that stands there:

2017
02:19:45,478 --> 02:19:52,688
giant beard, muscle-bound torso, bracers against
the arms, just one knee up. This very heroic pose

2018
02:19:52,688 --> 02:19:59,076
and just looking over the rest of Vasselheim under
his gaze. You see at the front of these iron

2019
02:19:59,076 --> 02:20:03,459
doors, there are two more Bastions adorned in the
same way as the ones that oversaw the battle at the

2020
02:20:03,518 --> 02:20:11,507
Crucible. One shouts out, "Halt! Ye who approacheth
the Trial Forge, what is your business here?"

2021
02:20:11,566 --> 02:20:19,287
LAURA: Yes, we are here to pay homage to
Earthbreaker Groon with the latest

2022
02:20:19,287 --> 02:20:21,571
champion of the city.

2023
02:20:21,571 --> 02:20:25,482
MATT: "Of the city? The city claims no champion!"

2024
02:20:25,482 --> 02:20:28,672
LAURA: Of the Crucible. You know.

2025
02:20:28,672 --> 02:20:30,675
MATT: They glance at each other.

2026
02:20:30,675 --> 02:20:32,156
LIAM: The Earthbreaker is a fan.

2027
02:20:32,156 --> 02:20:37,764
MATT: (chuckles) "I highly doubt that."

2028
02:20:37,764 --> 02:20:39,027
ORION: Tell him it's Grog's--

2029
02:20:39,027 --> 02:20:42,352
MARISHA: We're not there.

2030
02:20:42,352 --> 02:20:47,763
LIAM: Check your facts, buddy. He likes the cut of
his jib, believe you me.

2031
02:20:47,763 --> 02:20:56,146
MATT: And the other one gets up to his side and
stands there, arms crossed, looking down upon you

2032
02:20:56,146 --> 02:21:01,541
from three large stone steps up with this look of,
"I'm looking forward to throwing these guys out."

2033
02:21:01,541 --> 02:21:10,978
About five minutes pass and the next one comes
back and whispers in his ear... "Very well. The

2034
02:21:10,978 --> 02:21:19,514
"four of you may enter briefly. But this one's only
invited to the center chamber. The rest of you

2035
02:21:19,514 --> 02:21:24,131
"must keep a distance. A distance."

2036
02:21:24,131 --> 02:21:28,098
LAURA: Oh, yeah, like what? Ten feet? Yeah?

2037
02:21:28,098 --> 02:21:35,138
MATT: "You'll know." He steps aside and the doors
(stone scraping) slide open. As you guys step into

2038
02:21:35,138 --> 02:21:40,542
the interior, the smell that hits you immediately
is that of sage and other burned herbs that are

2039
02:21:40,542 --> 02:21:48,865
used ceremonially to cleanse a certain landscape
of evil spirits, from a superstitious standpoint, but

2040
02:21:48,918 --> 02:21:58,161
also to build an atmosphere of meditation and
understanding. The one Bastion that left and came

2041
02:21:58,161 --> 02:22:01,647
back and whispered in his ear comes up and leans
into you guys and gives you a nod. He doesn't

2042
02:22:01,647 --> 02:22:05,459
actually speak to you, but he gives you a
hand gesture to follow. Leads you into the Trial

2043
02:22:05,502 --> 02:22:11,882
Forge and you can see now, these halls are
essentially one long hallway. It's an arch about

2044
02:22:11,882 --> 02:22:20,256
85 to 100 feet up. And the interior of it is built
out of a very thick, sturdy reddish stone. You

2045
02:22:20,256 --> 02:22:24,206
don't know if the actual stone itself is built
from a substance of this color, or itself has been

2046
02:22:24,206 --> 02:22:29,465
stained or colored to match the rest of the Kord
reddish aesthetic. But as you step in, your

2047
02:22:29,465 --> 02:22:36,113
footfalls clack against a black marble floor with
what looks like gold streaks through it, almost

2048
02:22:36,113 --> 02:22:40,409
like there are small veins of some sort of gold
material that has been polished within the actual

2049
02:22:40,409 --> 02:22:41,562
marble itself.

2050
02:22:41,562 --> 02:22:42,824
LAURA: Very pretty.

2051
02:22:42,824 --> 02:22:47,508
MATT: Gives you a nod and a smile. No words in
response. Continues to gesture forth, and as you

2052
02:22:47,508 --> 02:22:52,207
guys step in, you see occasionally a few other
individuals walking by with a similar gold and red

2053
02:22:52,207 --> 02:22:58,871
robe aesthetic that you saw Earthbreaker wearing
when he went to watch your battle in the Crucible.

2054
02:22:58,871 --> 02:23:06,415
However, they are generally a little more dressed
down, very simple, as opposed the expressive

2055
02:23:06,415 --> 02:23:12,651
designs that were billowing across the baggy
leggings that the Earthbreaker was wearing. And

2056
02:23:12,707 --> 02:23:18,913
the robes. As you continue forward, they all step
aside and keep a quiet watch, until you begin to

2057
02:23:18,966 --> 02:23:23,837
notice in the distance, there are two large
hallways that intersect. You can see most of the

2058
02:23:23,837 --> 02:23:30,722
Trial Forge are now two long hallways that
intersect into a center piece. And the center

2059
02:23:30,722 --> 02:23:36,778
place of this temple, there is a raised dais at
three different levels. And at the top of it, you

2060
02:23:36,778 --> 02:23:43,262
can see, there is a beam of light that comes down
from above. As you begin to walk towards the

2061
02:23:43,262 --> 02:23:50,622
structure, you see there is a small figure that is
currently sitting on top of this central dais. As

2062
02:23:50,622 --> 02:23:56,029
you approach the outskirts of this main central
chamber where the two long hallways intersect, the

2063
02:23:56,029 --> 02:23:59,691
quiet Bastion puts his hand out and tells the rest
of you to stop.

2064
02:23:59,691 --> 02:24:02,195
Gives you a look and nudges you to proceed.

2065
02:24:02,195 --> 02:24:05,362
SAM: Do you need us with you?

2066
02:24:05,362 --> 02:24:07,829
TRAVIS: What? Yeah, you know I don't like
talking.

2067
02:24:07,829 --> 02:24:14,027
LAURA: (whispering) He's not very good at talking.
Would you like someone to come and

2068
02:24:14,027 --> 02:24:15,422
translate for him?

2069
02:24:15,422 --> 02:24:17,049
LIAM: Is he going on his own, then?

2070
02:24:17,049 --> 02:24:21,327
LAURA: Is that a yes?

2071
02:24:21,327 --> 02:24:23,010
SAM: Good luck.

2072
02:24:23,010 --> 02:24:24,107
LAURA: Okay, sorry.

2073
02:24:24,107 --> 02:24:25,624
TRAVIS: I go forward.

2074
02:24:25,624 --> 02:24:28,988
MATT: As you step forward, footfalls clacking
against the material--

2075
02:24:28,988 --> 02:24:36,529
LIAM: I'm sorry, we've been daytime drinking, and
I hate to interrupt that, do you have a place here

2076
02:24:36,529 --> 02:24:37,565
if I can't--

2077
02:24:37,565 --> 02:24:39,531
SAM: I don't think they-- This is a temple.

2078
02:24:39,531 --> 02:24:40,910
LAURA: Yeah this really not the kind of--

2079
02:24:40,910 --> 02:24:41,931
LIAM: Are you sure?

2080
02:24:41,931 --> 02:24:42,825
LAURA: Yeah.

2081
02:24:42,825 --> 02:24:44,373
MATT: Puts his hand out.

2082
02:24:44,373 --> 02:24:45,708
LAURA: They don't like talking.

2083
02:24:45,708 --> 02:24:50,470
SAM: Oh he has some sort of vow of silence. We
should respect it and also make fun of it when

2084
02:24:50,470 --> 02:24:51,670
he's gone.

2085
02:24:51,670 --> 02:24:56,122
LIAM: Is that the end of that? It's fine.
(whispering) I've got a flask.

2086
02:24:56,122 --> 02:25:02,243
MATT: As Grog steps out in the central chamber,
you can hear his footfalls echoing throughout the

2087
02:25:02,243 --> 02:25:09,149
site, and as you look up, you can see now the
light source from above, there is what looks like

2088
02:25:09,149 --> 02:25:14,120
a stained-glass domed roof to the top of the
central chamber. There is a dark spot in the

2089
02:25:14,120 --> 02:25:20,008
center, where you can see the shadow from the
early afternoon sun is being blocked from the

2090
02:25:20,008 --> 02:25:24,693
giant statue of Kord that remains at the top of
this temple, who is currently, essentially, now

2091
02:25:24,693 --> 02:25:31,197
looking at the structure, straddling the top of
this giant domed stained glass roof, and so

2092
02:25:31,197 --> 02:25:36,602
underneath this statue is where the top of this
structure is, and through it, these beams of light

2093
02:25:36,602 --> 02:25:42,223
are coming down, multicolored and cascading onto
this central chamber. Sitting in the center, you

2094
02:25:42,223 --> 02:25:48,859
see, cross-legged, arms to the side, eyes closed,
there sits Earthbreaker Groon, the Dawn Marshal

2095
02:25:48,859 --> 02:25:51,198
himself. Quiet, as you approach.

2096
02:25:51,198 --> 02:25:52,303
TRAVIS: Eyes closed?

2097
02:25:52,303 --> 02:25:53,688
MATT: Eyes closed.

2098
02:25:53,688 --> 02:26:06,278
TRAVIS: I step forward and say: (coughs) Sorry to
disturb, I'm looking for Earthbreaker Groon.

2099
02:26:06,278 --> 02:26:13,041
MATT: You see an eyebrow twitch for a second. Eyes
remain closed, and the head turns for a second.

2100
02:26:13,041 --> 02:26:20,529
Hands come together like this, and in that one
motion stands to his feet, almost like it was

2101
02:26:20,529 --> 02:26:23,752
effortless, from what would seem like a very
uncomfortable position, suddenly is fully standing

2102
02:26:23,752 --> 02:26:31,568
with a swift movement. In place, rotates and turns
towards you, eyes still closed, at which point the

2103
02:26:31,568 --> 02:26:35,959
eyes open-- and you saw pupils previously, but in
this moment of what seems to be serious

2104
02:26:35,959 --> 02:26:43,194
meditation, there is this luminescent white light
that encompasses the entirety of each eye, just

2105
02:26:43,194 --> 02:26:46,536
looking straight towards you, the hands still
clasped in the center.

2106
02:26:46,536 --> 02:26:48,056
They're staring straight at you.

2107
02:26:48,056 --> 02:26:49,399
TRAVIS: Okay.

2108
02:26:49,399 --> 02:26:59,059
MATT: "You have found the Earthbreaker. What do
you ask of me?"

2109
02:26:59,059 --> 02:27:07,247
TRAVIS: I keep the little bit of pee that's about
to fall out from falling out, and I say: I

2110
02:27:07,247 --> 02:27:14,369
happened to see you amongst the crowd at my recent
tussle. It seemed that everyone there seemed to

2111
02:27:14,369 --> 02:27:19,467
know who you were. I wanted to at least introduce
myself.

2112
02:27:19,467 --> 02:27:24,074
MATT: "You are Grog the Victorious."

2113
02:27:24,074 --> 02:27:26,744
TRAVIS: That's right! (coughs) That's right.

2114
02:27:26,744 --> 02:27:37,654
MATT: "Once called Philip. Known as one of Vox
Machina, the travelling band from Emon. Slayer of

2115
02:27:37,654 --> 02:27:54,223
"demons that once usurped Uriel himself. I know of
your travels. I know of your deeds. What else do

2116
02:27:54,223 --> 02:27:57,999
"you ask of the Earthbreaker?"

2117
02:27:57,999 --> 02:28:12,129
TRAVIS: I don't really ask. I only mean to say
that Vox Machina is at your disposal, if you would

2118
02:28:12,129 --> 02:28:26,886
ever need someone outside of the amazing Braving
Grounds, Vasselheim. We're really amazing.

2119
02:28:26,886 --> 02:28:30,216
ORION: We know where they're at, right?

2120
02:28:30,216 --> 02:28:31,158
MARISHA: No.

2121
02:28:31,158 --> 02:28:32,369
ORION: We don't know where they're at?

2122
02:28:32,369 --> 02:28:34,258
TRAVIS: If you would just keep us in mind.

2123
02:28:34,258 --> 02:28:41,344
MATT: At this point in time, his eyelids close,
and they open again, and there's a softness that

2124
02:28:41,344 --> 02:28:46,930
there wasn't before. The white light has faded,
and you can now see beneath them these extremely

2125
02:28:46,930 --> 02:28:55,109
piercing very, very light blue, almost white
irises that surround his pupils. And from his old,

2126
02:28:55,109 --> 02:29:01,604
weathered, wrinkled face from underneath his
beard, you can see a smile slowly crawl across

2127
02:29:01,642 --> 02:29:08,902
his cheeks. His hands release and rest to his
side. He lifts his head slightly as if to look

2128
02:29:08,902 --> 02:29:17,518
down at you from upon this dais, not with
judgment, but with curiosity. His voice echoes and

2129
02:29:17,518 --> 02:29:25,914
booms through this with even but a whisper from
his throat, once again saying, "Your piety is

2130
02:29:25,914 --> 02:29:36,453
"accepted. Perhaps there may be a use for Kord of
you and your compatriots in the future. Should

2131
02:29:36,453 --> 02:29:47,767
"this day arise, you will know, and you must hurry.
Dark times are ahead. I can see the veils

2132
02:29:47,767 --> 02:30:00,228
"twisting. Many, many evil minds come to rend the
peace apart. There will be a day I call for you,

2133
02:30:00,228 --> 02:30:06,278
"Grog the Victorious. Stay alive."

2134
02:30:06,278 --> 02:30:14,132
TRAVIS: I mean to. Thank you. It has been an honor
being in your presence.

2135
02:30:14,262 --> 02:30:21,953
MATT: He steps back to his position originally.
"Now go." He turns around and sits back into his

2136
02:30:21,953 --> 02:30:27,136
meditate position and closes his eyes and
disappears back into the same place where you

2137
02:30:27,136 --> 02:30:28,611
originally saw him.

2138
02:30:28,611 --> 02:30:32,324
TRAVIS: I turn around and I go: Guys, his fucking
eyes are glowing.

2139
02:30:32,324 --> 02:30:34,270
LIAM: (whispers) We're not here.

2140
02:30:34,270 --> 02:30:35,551
LAURA: (whispers) You've got to go.

2141
02:30:35,551 --> 02:30:37,221
SAM: You kept it together great!

2142
02:30:37,221 --> 02:30:38,558
TRAVIS: Thanks. Did you hear all of that?

2143
02:30:38,558 --> 02:30:40,309
SAM: Yeah, I couldn't hear much, but it was
great.

2144
02:30:40,309 --> 02:30:42,145
TRAVIS: I almost had an aneurysm.

2145
02:30:42,145 --> 02:30:44,129
LIAM: He sounded very serious.

2146
02:30:44,129 --> 02:30:46,690
TRAVIS: Yeah we should go. He's cool.

2147
02:30:46,690 --> 02:30:48,068
SAM: Do you think I should shit somewhere--

2148
02:30:48,068 --> 02:30:49,769
LAURA: No. Just go.

2149
02:30:49,769 --> 02:30:51,165
SAM: Okay, we'll just go, then.

2150
02:30:51,165 --> 02:30:52,771
TRAVIS: Yeah, sans shit. And we're out.

2151
02:30:52,771 --> 02:30:53,778
LIAM: Better be safe.

2152
02:30:53,778 --> 02:30:55,372
SAM: Better be safe?

2153
02:30:55,372 --> 02:30:56,575
LIAM: Just a little one.

2154
02:30:56,575 --> 02:30:57,843
LAURA and TRAVIS: No.

2155
02:30:57,843 --> 02:30:59,239
SAM: No? Okay, we'll just go.

2156
02:30:59,239 --> 02:31:04,684
TRAVIS: And we make our way out of the
golden-floored, glowing-eyed guy's house.

2157
02:31:04,684 --> 02:31:07,806
MATT: You are escorted out of the Trial Forge. You
eventually meet up with the rest of Vox Machina.

2158
02:31:07,806 --> 02:31:14,897
You carrying to your side, strapped, a dried
hogshead filled with black powder and a cart of

2159
02:31:14,897 --> 02:31:18,167
about 100 pounds of iron ingots.

2160
02:31:18,167 --> 02:31:20,830
TRAVIS: Ooh! You want me to hold onto all that for
you?

2161
02:31:20,830 --> 02:31:25,013
TALIESIN: Actually, if you could just help load it
onto the ship, that would be lovely.

2162
02:31:25,013 --> 02:31:26,337
SAM: Are we going on the airship?

2163
02:31:26,337 --> 02:31:28,504
ORION: If we could fit it in the Bag of Holding,
it would be much better.

2164
02:31:28,504 --> 02:31:32,911
TALIESIN: Sure. Certainly, if we can put it in the
Bag of Holding, that would be fine.

2165
02:31:32,911 --> 02:31:34,358
LAURA: Is that a pig's head?

2166
02:31:34,358 --> 02:31:35,688
MARISHA: It is literally a pig's head.

2167
02:31:35,688 --> 02:31:40,180
TALIESIN: I... Yes, that is in fact a pig's head.
It's complicated.

2168
02:31:40,180 --> 02:31:46,925
SAM: Let's find Captain Damon and get back on the
ship.

2169
02:31:46,925 --> 02:31:49,038
ORION: I start casting Circle of Teleportation.

2170
02:31:49,038 --> 02:31:54,242
MATT: As you guys are having this discussion, you
look over and you can see the airship, which is a

2171
02:31:54,242 --> 02:31:58,162
not too hard to see from this distance, is
currently being outfitted, actually being

2172
02:31:58,162 --> 02:32:02,689
finalized, being outfitted with brand new
ballistae. Remember those giant dragon-headed

2173
02:32:02,689 --> 02:32:06,690
ballistae you saw settled on the walls on the
outskirts of Vasselheim? Those have now been

2174
02:32:06,690 --> 02:32:12,442
affixed to the airship, as the previous air
encounter it had, they didn't seem to quite cut

2175
02:32:12,442 --> 02:32:16,949
through the defenses. You guys notice this just in
time, as you see a flash of light and you look

2176
02:32:16,949 --> 02:32:22,775
over your shoulder, and Tiberius has finished
drawing what looks to be a large sigil-- I fixed

2177
02:32:22,775 --> 02:32:24,217
my pronunciation in that, thank you--

2178
02:32:24,217 --> 02:32:26,282
SAM: I like "siggle."

2179
02:32:26,282 --> 02:32:31,628
MATT: I grew up with "siggle," and nevertheless--
I know. Sigil--

2180
02:32:31,628 --> 02:32:38,727
LIAM: Since I came in at the halfway mark, I
really wanted to go to an ink specialist here in

2181
02:32:38,727 --> 02:32:46,703
Vasselheim before we left, so can we retcon and go
backwards and say that I got the elven sounds for

2182
02:32:46,703 --> 02:32:51,855
"vuh" and "mm" put right there?

2183
02:32:51,855 --> 02:32:53,971
LAURA: Tattooed on his fucking wrist.

2184
02:32:53,971 --> 02:33:04,389
LIAM: Elven. And then over here, I don't remember
much of the mathematics, that my teachers in our

2185
02:33:04,389 --> 02:33:05,635
homeland--

2186
02:33:05,635 --> 02:33:12,090
SAM: Wait, are you saying that someone out there
in the world should do the elven symbol for VM and

2187
02:33:12,090 --> 02:33:14,411
we should all get literally tattooed?

2188
02:33:14,411 --> 02:33:20,631
LIAM: No, that's ridiculous. But over here, I have
a mathematical shape. I don't know if you know

2189
02:33:20,631 --> 02:33:26,918
arithmetic, but I learned arithmetic when I was
studying. I learned knife-work, I learned elven

2190
02:33:26,918 --> 02:33:33,943
poetry, and I learned arithmetic and I had a knack
for it. She didn't, but I did. And I would like to

2191
02:33:33,943 --> 02:33:39,457
get a-- it was called an icosahedron-- right
here.

2192
02:33:39,457 --> 02:33:40,931
LAURA: Right here?

2193
02:33:40,931 --> 02:33:42,351
LIAM: Right here.

2194
02:33:42,351 --> 02:33:46,421
MARISHA: Wait, are we all doing that together?

2195
02:33:46,421 --> 02:33:47,604
SAM: In real life?

2196
02:33:47,604 --> 02:33:49,158
MARISHA: I'll go with you.

2197
02:33:49,158 --> 02:33:52,341
LIAM: This is real life. But to start--

2198
02:33:52,341 --> 02:33:56,912
MARISHA: You guys, we got a little day-drunk.
Let's go together. Come on.

2199
02:33:56,912 --> 02:34:02,884
LIAM: Just me, the symbol for "vuh" and "mm" in
Elven right there.

2200
02:34:03,024 --> 02:34:08,849
MATT: All right. So, as you've had this done over
the past few days as you were awaiting the return

2201
02:34:08,849 --> 02:34:14,552
of the other team who went off against a white
dragon, apparently, you've had the time to do so,

2202
02:34:14,552 --> 02:34:16,901
you just haven't quite revealed it to the rest of
your allies yet.

2203
02:34:16,901 --> 02:34:17,851
LIAM: All right.

2204
02:34:17,851 --> 02:34:20,896
MATT: All right. But you guys look over your
shoulder, and as you're talking about taking an

2205
02:34:20,896 --> 02:34:25,100
airship, Tiberius has crafted a runic circle into
the ground that itself is beginning to pulse with

2206
02:34:25,100 --> 02:34:28,653
arcane energy, a familiar "siggle," one that you
think actually--

2207
02:34:28,653 --> 02:34:29,938
LAURA: (whispers) Sigil.

2208
02:34:29,938 --> 02:34:36,902
MATT: Sigil. No, I keep fucking it up. I just
happily fixed it, and then you caught me.

2209
02:34:36,902 --> 02:34:43,385
LIAM: That's pronounced Coke and a cola.

2210
02:34:43,385 --> 02:34:50,121
MATT: There we go. The arcane <i>sigil</i> on the
ground, a familiar one that you once saw on the

2211
02:34:50,121 --> 02:34:53,142
beach of one Underdark subterranean island.

2212
02:34:53,142 --> 02:34:57,640
MARISHA: Down by the beach, so that we have--

2213
02:34:57,640 --> 02:34:59,459
LAURA: Down over by the bad lands?

2214
02:34:59,459 --> 02:35:03,128
MATT: Tiberius, you are on the cusp of completing
your ritual.

2215
02:35:03,128 --> 02:35:07,531
ORION: Oh, I choose Emon.

2216
02:35:07,531 --> 02:35:14,143
MATT: All right. The sigil flashes with arcane
energy and opens up. You see a small doorway

2217
02:35:14,143 --> 02:35:16,497
that's sparkling across the ground.

2218
02:35:16,497 --> 02:35:17,848
MARISHA: He's just making the sigil.

2219
02:35:17,848 --> 02:35:20,401
LAURA: We can just pop over to Emon.

2220
02:35:20,401 --> 02:35:25,461
MATT: You can see the sigil shimmering as the
energy is beginning to fade.

2221
02:35:25,461 --> 02:35:26,912
TRAVIS: We should go in.

2222
02:35:26,912 --> 02:35:28,127
TALIESIN: Let's go!

2223
02:35:28,127 --> 02:35:30,008
SAM: What about the airship? What about Captain
Damon?

2224
02:35:30,008 --> 02:35:31,771
LAURA: The airship was only going to take us to
Emon, anyway.

2225
02:35:31,771 --> 02:35:33,856
LIAM: I walk right through it and say, Tiberius,
where are we going?

2226
02:35:33,856 --> 02:35:36,307
ORION: Emon. I go through, too.

2227
02:35:36,307 --> 02:35:37,359
SAM: Captain Damon--

2228
02:35:37,359 --> 02:35:39,133
ORION: I'll hold it for a minute.

2229
02:35:39,133 --> 02:35:40,780
LAURA: Good thinking, Tiberius!

2230
02:35:40,780 --> 02:35:42,436
MARISHA: And I just jump in, woohoo!

2231
02:35:42,436 --> 02:35:43,909
MATT: You all leap through the sigil--

2232
02:35:43,909 --> 02:35:47,435
TALIESIN: I keep jumping into things.

2233
02:35:47,435 --> 02:35:50,355
MARISHA: I like jumping into things. I like leap
of faiths. They're exciting.

2234
02:35:50,355 --> 02:35:54,667
MATT: You guys find yourself once again in a
small, white room. Familiar; the place that was

2235
02:35:54,667 --> 02:35:59,902
your immediate sigh of relief when you returned
from the Underdark.

2236
02:35:59,902 --> 02:36:01,621
MARISHA: Guys, it feels good to be home.

2237
02:36:01,653 --> 02:36:06,073
MATT: You push through the doorway, returning once
again to the 80-foot circular chamber of white

2238
02:36:06,073 --> 02:36:11,212
stone, where a vibrant crystal chandelier hangs
from the ceiling. There are five other doors

2239
02:36:11,212 --> 02:36:15,805
around the room, and you are currently in the
center of the Traverse Junction within the

2240
02:36:15,805 --> 02:36:17,234
Alabaster Lyceum.

2241
02:36:17,234 --> 02:36:19,850
LIAM: I mean, we just did this. It wasn't too long
ago.

2242
02:36:19,850 --> 02:36:22,640
LAURA: So it's okay, we popped out. Is the same
guy there?

2243
02:36:22,640 --> 02:36:26,063
MATT: Indeed. Gatekeeper Xanthus is there waiting
for you.

2244
02:36:26,063 --> 02:36:27,725
MARISHA: How long have we been gone?

2245
02:36:27,725 --> 02:36:29,846
TRAVIS: Hold on, Tiberius wants to say something.

2246
02:36:29,846 --> 02:36:35,853
ORION: To explain the travel schematic, it would
take us a few days to come back on the airship to

2247
02:36:35,853 --> 02:36:40,044
this particular area if want to go back to
Kraghammer. It would be much more efficient if we

2248
02:36:40,044 --> 02:36:44,502
teleport, as we have, and take a transport to
Kraghammer, which is only north of here, as well,

2249
02:36:44,502 --> 02:36:46,397
which will only probably take a day, right?

2250
02:36:46,397 --> 02:36:47,801
LAURA: Five days.

2251
02:36:47,801 --> 02:36:49,215
SAM: Oh shit, did we leave Trinket?

2252
02:36:49,215 --> 02:36:51,069
LAURA: Trinket is with us.

2253
02:36:51,069 --> 02:36:52,734
ORION: Airship. From here.

2254
02:36:52,734 --> 02:36:58,046
MATT: Oh. It is nearly a week to travel from Emon
to Vasselheim in the airship, yes.

2255
02:36:58,046 --> 02:36:59,164
ORION: To Kraghammer?

2256
02:36:59,164 --> 02:37:01,707
MATT: No, to Kraghammer from here, it's about a
three-day travel on horseback.

2257
02:37:01,707 --> 02:37:04,034
ORION: Right. The airship, right?

2258
02:37:04,127 --> 02:37:06,367
MATT: There is no airship to Kraghammer.

2259
02:37:06,367 --> 02:37:09,296
LAURA: Yeah, but it would have dropped us off in
Emon anyway.

2260
02:37:09,296 --> 02:37:11,101
ORION: So we just shaved off five days.

2261
02:37:11,101 --> 02:37:13,475
SAM: Good job, Tiberius.

2262
02:37:13,475 --> 02:37:17,414
LAURA: I pop on out and I say, hello again.

2263
02:37:17,414 --> 02:37:21,120
MATT: "Yes? Oh, you. You've returned."

2264
02:37:21,120 --> 02:37:22,881
LAURA: Yes, we have.

2265
02:37:22,881 --> 02:37:27,154
MATT: "Well, this time, I would like you to fill
out the proper paperwork."

2266
02:37:27,154 --> 02:37:32,387
LAURA: This time, of course, you already know
ahead of time that we are dear friends of Uriel,

2267
02:37:32,387 --> 02:37:34,460
and we do not need to.

2268
02:37:34,460 --> 02:37:40,198
MATT: "That is not true. I had my ass chewed out
by Headmaster Thurmond the last time you came

2269
02:37:40,198 --> 02:37:45,622
"through and told me that. So--" and he fumbles
underneath his desk-- (boof) slams down what looks

2270
02:37:45,622 --> 02:37:51,312
to be a cluster of about 20 to 25 papers. "I
require you to fill these out so I do not lose my

2271
02:37:51,312 --> 02:37:53,422
"job here in the Lyceum."

2272
02:37:53,422 --> 02:37:56,929
LIAM: All right, Vax pulls it over and starts
filling it out and says, all right, but you know,

2273
02:37:56,929 --> 02:37:58,882
we're kind of a big deal here--

2274
02:37:58,882 --> 02:38:02,417
LAURA: I was saying, Percy is so good at
paperwork.

2275
02:38:02,417 --> 02:38:04,221
ORION: I can split the load.

2276
02:38:04,221 --> 02:38:07,889
MARISHA: I thought we had a lawyer for this. I
thought we had Burt Reynolds, esquire.

2277
02:38:07,889 --> 02:38:11,619
ORION: We're doing the paperwork.

2278
02:38:11,619 --> 02:38:20,552
LIAM: I've got it, Burt. Just because you didn't
like paperwork, or Elven, doesn't mean I don't.

2279
02:38:20,552 --> 02:38:23,120
I've got it. But Uriel's not going to be pleased.

2280
02:38:23,120 --> 02:38:24,639
LAURA: He's going to be super pissed.

2281
02:38:24,639 --> 02:38:25,931
LIAM: But don't worry, I'll do it.

2282
02:38:25,931 --> 02:38:28,602
MATT: "I look forward to it. Great."

2283
02:38:28,602 --> 02:38:30,316
ORION: Well, there you are, and here's my--

2284
02:38:30,316 --> 02:38:31,918
SAM: Do you have a bathroom around here?

2285
02:38:31,918 --> 02:38:33,406
ORION: Oh, Scanlan, hold it.

2286
02:38:33,406 --> 02:38:36,282
MATT: "Down the hall to the left."

2287
02:38:36,282 --> 02:38:38,035
SAM: All right. I might make it.

2288
02:38:38,035 --> 02:38:47,170
LIAM: Vax fills out the entire thing, except for
the final signature, and says, Scanlan, could you

2289
02:38:47,170 --> 02:38:48,877
put the final signature on this?

2290
02:38:48,877 --> 02:38:49,974
ORION: Notarize it.

2291
02:38:49,974 --> 02:38:51,226
LAURA: Tiberius is helping.

2292
02:38:51,226 --> 02:39:01,143
SAM: Oh boy. Buttoning up my fly. Final signature?
I'll just sign my name.

2293
02:39:01,143 --> 02:39:03,969
LIAM: That works, too.

2294
02:39:03,969 --> 02:39:08,403
MATT: "Thank you kindly. You are free to go."

2295
02:39:08,403 --> 02:39:09,923
LAURA: Thank you so much.

2296
02:39:09,923 --> 02:39:11,366
MATT: "Oh, it's been a pleasure."

2297
02:39:11,366 --> 02:39:12,513
LAURA: A real pleasure.

2298
02:39:12,513 --> 02:39:13,948
MATT: "Very much so, thank you."

2299
02:39:13,948 --> 02:39:14,843
LAURA: Thank you.

2300
02:39:14,843 --> 02:39:15,762
MATT: "Thank you."

2301
02:39:15,762 --> 02:39:16,776
LAURA: Thank you so much.

2302
02:39:16,776 --> 02:39:18,237
MATT: "Thank you so much."

2303
02:39:18,237 --> 02:39:20,204
TRAVIS: Okay, here we go. We'll go out this way.

2304
02:39:20,204 --> 02:39:22,767
SAM: You know what I think? I think you guys hate
each other, actually.

2305
02:39:22,767 --> 02:39:28,401
MATT: "Be on your way. Goodbye. Please, leave now.
Go."

2306
02:39:28,401 --> 02:39:31,443
LAURA: Emon is so beautiful--

2307
02:39:31,443 --> 02:39:33,345
SAM: Don't worry, I shat in the hallway.

2308
02:39:33,345 --> 02:39:36,637
LAURA: What time of day is it?

2309
02:39:36,637 --> 02:39:40,312
MATT: As you guys leave the Lyceum, you enter the
main courtyard that leads into it. You are

2310
02:39:40,312 --> 02:39:45,909
currently within the Cloudtop District of Emon, a
clear blue sky dotted with clouds ahead of you.

2311
02:39:45,909 --> 02:39:52,361
You gather it's probably around 2:00 or 3:00 in
the afternoon. No time has passed, since the

2312
02:39:52,361 --> 02:39:54,623
travel was instantaneous, thanks to
teleportation.

2313
02:39:54,623 --> 02:39:56,166
LAURA: You are so good, you.

2314
02:39:56,166 --> 02:40:01,979
TALIESIN: Why don't we take a day or two to
recuperate and then make our way to Kraghammer?

2315
02:40:01,979 --> 02:40:04,095
MARISHA: We are officially drunk in two different
cities!

2316
02:40:04,095 --> 02:40:05,657
LAURA: I'm not drunk.

2317
02:40:05,657 --> 02:40:07,396
SAM: Is our next destination Kraghammer?

2318
02:40:07,396 --> 02:40:09,182
ORION: Yes. Collect our money.

2319
02:40:09,182 --> 02:40:12,288
SAM: Let's take a night and then go set off in the
morning.

2320
02:40:12,288 --> 02:40:14,338
ORION: What time is it right now, in the day?

2321
02:40:14,338 --> 02:40:15,560
MATT: It's about 4PM.

2322
02:40:15,560 --> 02:40:20,876
ORION: Could we ride, maybe? Drunk riding.

2323
02:40:20,876 --> 02:40:25,488
MARISHA: Well... (whining) We haven't been home in
so long.

2324
02:40:25,488 --> 02:40:27,161
ORION: We can go to the keep and say hi to
everyone.

2325
02:40:27,161 --> 02:40:29,833
MARISHA: I need to water the garden. It's probably
half dead.

2326
02:40:29,833 --> 02:40:31,835
ORION: No, we have servants that do that.

2327
02:40:31,835 --> 02:40:32,754
SAM: To the keep!

2328
02:40:32,754 --> 02:40:34,392
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: To the keep.

2329
02:40:34,392 --> 02:40:39,861
MATT: All right. You guys make your way through
the Cloudtop District to the southern edge of

2330
02:40:39,861 --> 02:40:47,757
Emon, to the lower slums outside of the city,
along the southern wall to Greyskull Keep. The

2331
02:40:47,757 --> 02:40:53,675
visual is welcoming. It looks standing, clean, and
in the distance you can see a figure walking

2332
02:40:53,675 --> 02:40:59,444
across the top of the wall, keeping watch. As you
get closer, you can see it is the image of

2333
02:40:59,444 --> 02:41:06,000
Cordell, the half-orc individual that you guys
hired along with Shayne. As you approach the front

2334
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:17,875
gate, you see what looks like a tent: a large,
thick burlap or linen, brown tent is set up right

2335
02:41:17,875 --> 02:41:19,637
outside of you guys'--

2336
02:41:19,637 --> 02:41:20,749
LIAM: That wasn't there before--

2337
02:41:20,749 --> 02:41:21,957
LAURA: What? What is that?

2338
02:41:21,957 --> 02:41:24,081
SAM: Cordell. Cordell! What is this tent?

2339
02:41:24,081 --> 02:41:29,267
MATT: Cordell is looking over the edge as you
approach and he gives you a wave. "Hello." And you

2340
02:41:29,267 --> 02:41:34,695
can see Shayne runs up next to him off the top.
She has her crossbow at the ready. She goes, "Oh!

2341
02:41:34,695 --> 02:41:41,090
"Finally, you've arrived. I'm so glad you could
make it. Yes, this has been here for about two

2342
02:41:41,090 --> 02:41:42,438
"weeks now."

2343
02:41:42,438 --> 02:41:44,249
SAM: Is someone inside of it?

2344
02:41:44,249 --> 02:41:47,528
MATT: At which point, you hear sudden rustling
from inside of the tent and a face pops out,

2345
02:41:47,528 --> 02:41:52,373
briefly. You can see what looks like humanoid
features, and suddenly darts back inside. And you

2346
02:41:52,373 --> 02:41:54,681
hear more rustling. It sounds like pots and metals
clinking around.

2347
02:41:54,681 --> 02:41:56,734
LAURA: I immediately go over there and throw open
the--

2348
02:41:56,734 --> 02:42:01,337
MATT: As you throw open the tent, at that moment,
you see another person is pushing out of the tent.

2349
02:42:01,337 --> 02:42:04,358
And you both have this awkward moment where you
both (awkward noises) and he pushes off of you

2350
02:42:04,358 --> 02:42:08,472
instinctively and rights himself. The tent half
collapses behind him and he catches himself and

2351
02:42:08,472 --> 02:42:15,544
stands there at the ready. You see before you what
looks to be a young man, probably in his late

2352
02:42:15,544 --> 02:42:25,620
teens, 19 to 20 years old. Haphazardly dressed in
scale mail armor, a longsword, crossbow, and

2353
02:42:25,620 --> 02:42:31,558
handaxe, and buckler all dangling from his belts,
weighing him down slightly. His dark brown eyes

2354
02:42:31,558 --> 02:42:36,444
peer from beneath his short, tousled ash-blond
hair. And a nervous yet excited smile flashes

2355
02:42:36,480 --> 02:42:45,945
across his face. "Oh! You've returned! Ah. You!
You, Percival. Percival, the great one who streaks

2356
02:42:45,945 --> 02:42:54,804
"fire from his tube. And the great druid princess.
Keyleth, right? And you. You, the dragonborn who

2357
02:42:54,804 --> 02:43:00,008
"controls the elements himself. Tiberius of the
Stormwind family, yes. Yes, I've heard of you.

2358
02:43:00,008 --> 02:43:07,398
"Scanlan. Scanlan I've heard your tales across the
land. Your womanizing does not reach ears too far

2359
02:43:07,398 --> 02:43:08,323
"from the city."

2360
02:43:08,323 --> 02:43:10,165
SAM: Well, I'm... Men, too.

2361
02:43:10,165 --> 02:43:18,607
MATT: "And you, the twins. Vax'ildan and
Vex'ahlia. Oh, the many bodies you've lain at your

2362
02:43:18,607 --> 02:43:27,165
"feet of the evil that crossed your path. And the
mighty, muscled Grog. Oh, I am beside myself. I've

2363
02:43:27,165 --> 02:43:28,468
"been waiting for this--"

2364
02:43:28,468 --> 02:43:29,960
LAURA: Grog the Victorious. Get it right.

2365
02:43:29,960 --> 02:43:31,209
MATT: "The Victorious. Yes, of course!"

2366
02:43:31,209 --> 02:43:34,889
SAM: And you are, young man?

2367
02:43:34,889 --> 02:43:45,597
MATT: "I am Kynan Leore, son of Harold the
butcher, and I wish to join you in your travels."

2368
02:43:45,597 --> 02:43:49,618
LAURA: Oh, darling! You're so brave and strong.

2369
02:43:49,618 --> 02:43:51,850
ORION: Well, you're welcome to do so--

2370
02:43:51,850 --> 02:43:53,762
SAM: No! No, not at all.

2371
02:43:53,762 --> 02:43:58,532
MATT: "Really? It would be my honor. It really,
truly would be."

2372
02:43:58,532 --> 02:44:06,014
SAM: No. This is not an open membership situation.
Vox Machina has been together for many years, and

2373
02:44:06,014 --> 02:44:08,052
we've forged our bonds of friendship--

2374
02:44:08,052 --> 02:44:10,278
MATT: "I can forge my way. I can prove myself."

2375
02:44:10,278 --> 02:44:12,318
ORION: What is your skill, sir?

2376
02:44:12,318 --> 02:44:17,746
MATT: "Well. My father, Harold the butcher, is
well known throughout these lands."

2377
02:44:17,746 --> 02:44:18,861
MARISHA: For?

2378
02:44:18,861 --> 02:44:20,405
LAURA: Butchering, I believe.

2379
02:44:20,405 --> 02:44:21,938
TRAVIS: He's a good butcher. Yep.

2380
02:44:21,938 --> 02:44:30,266
MATT: "Well, he is an actual butcher in the upper
slums. But! I have been training day and night for

2381
02:44:30,266 --> 02:44:35,627
"months until I was ready to fight alongside you
all and I humbly offer my sword

2382
02:44:35,627 --> 02:44:36,976
"as part of Vox Machina."

2383
02:44:36,976 --> 02:44:38,046
ORION: Ah, your sword?

2384
02:44:38,046 --> 02:44:39,407
MATT: "Yes, I am a skilled swordsman!"

2385
02:44:39,407 --> 02:44:40,601
LAURA: You are?

2386
02:44:40,601 --> 02:44:46,563
MATT: "I trained under old Leonard Fyke, an
ex-guard captain of Emon, himself.

2387
02:44:46,563 --> 02:44:47,966
"He was a friend of--"

2388
02:44:47,966 --> 02:44:49,967
MARISHA: Wait. What was his name? Linen Fyken?

2389
02:44:49,967 --> 02:44:51,407
MATT: "Leonard Fyke. He was once--"

2390
02:44:51,407 --> 02:44:52,532
MARISHA: Leonard Fyke.

2391
02:44:52,532 --> 02:44:53,375
MATT: "Leonard Fyke, yes."

2392
02:44:53,375 --> 02:44:55,731
ORION: As he's talking, I motion to open the
gates.

2393
02:44:55,731 --> 02:45:02,112
MATT: You hear a shift as Shayne and Cordell begin
to pull the top of the gates, the chains

2394
02:45:02,112 --> 02:45:03,586
clenching. (metal creaking)

2395
02:45:03,586 --> 02:45:06,791
LIAM: Is he talking to Vex? Are they talking
together?

2396
02:45:06,791 --> 02:45:08,773
LAURA: I'm using insight on him as he's talking.

2397
02:45:08,773 --> 02:45:10,080
MATT: Go ahead and roll insight.

2398
02:45:10,080 --> 02:45:11,437
LIAM: How close are they?

2399
02:45:11,437 --> 02:45:13,587
MATT: They're about four feet across.

2400
02:45:13,587 --> 02:45:18,768
LIAM: Four feet apart? I flip a dagger in my hand
and I go (impact noise) to the back of his head,

2401
02:45:18,821 --> 02:45:20,542
is what I do.

2402
02:45:20,542 --> 02:45:21,937
MARISHA: Just to knock him out?

2403
02:45:21,937 --> 02:45:24,756
LIAM: Yeah. I did it. It's done.

2404
02:45:24,756 --> 02:45:26,649
MATT: All right. Roll an attack.

2405
02:45:26,649 --> 02:45:32,318
LIAM: Don't worry. I'm using the flat end. Oh,
good. That's a 17.

2406
02:45:32,318 --> 02:45:33,702
SAM: Plus whatever.

2407
02:45:33,702 --> 02:45:34,979
LIAM: Plus a high number.

2408
02:45:34,979 --> 02:45:36,009
MATT: Oh, you rolled a 17?

2409
02:45:36,009 --> 02:45:36,939
LIAM: Yeah.

2410
02:45:36,939 --> 02:45:42,543
MATT: Go ahead and roll sneak attack damage. It's
a critical because he hasn't acted.

2411
02:45:42,587 --> 02:45:45,164
LIAM: Yeah, but it's the back end of the dagger,
all right?

2412
02:45:45,164 --> 02:45:47,825
MATT: Yeah. Go ahead and roll sneak attack times
two.

2413
02:45:47,825 --> 02:45:49,220
ORION: I go inside the keep.

2414
02:45:49,220 --> 02:45:50,740
LAURA: And you're touching my dice!

2415
02:45:50,740 --> 02:45:56,199
LIAM: The boy needs a lesson. This is not a life
for a child. Okay, that's good.

2416
02:45:56,199 --> 02:45:58,988
SAM: Oh Jesus. It's like a million.

2417
02:45:58,988 --> 02:46:02,327
MATT: Times two.

2418
02:46:02,327 --> 02:46:06,122
LIAM: 28 on the sneak attack damage only.

2419
02:46:06,122 --> 02:46:08,828
MATT: Is that times two? Or is it 28 times two?

2420
02:46:08,828 --> 02:46:11,177
LIAM: Oh, times two. So that's--

2421
02:46:11,177 --> 02:46:13,481
SAM: Dead!

2422
02:46:13,481 --> 02:46:15,505
LIAM: No, he's not.

2423
02:46:15,505 --> 02:46:18,843
TALIESIN: You cleaved his head off with the blunt
end of the knife.

2424
02:46:18,843 --> 02:46:20,741
LAURA: If he's a level one, you killed him.

2425
02:46:20,741 --> 02:46:24,473
LIAM: It's 56. Just the sneak attack damage
alone.

2426
02:46:24,473 --> 02:46:29,457
MATT: And then add the d4 and the modifier for the
dagger.

2427
02:46:29,457 --> 02:46:31,694
LIAM: That's ten.

2428
02:46:31,694 --> 02:46:34,427
MATT: So a total of 66 damage.

2429
02:46:34,427 --> 02:46:36,097
LIAM: 66 damage, yeah.

2430
02:46:36,097 --> 02:46:42,645
MATT: 66 damage. As you're having this
conversation, you (whoosh) behind him and (whack)

2431
02:46:42,645 --> 02:46:47,925
right to the temple. He's like, "I'm a swordsman.
I'm trained. I'm--" (impact noise). And he goes

2432
02:46:47,925 --> 02:46:50,129
straight down into a pile.

2433
02:46:50,129 --> 02:46:56,260
LIAM: With my bonus action, I pull out one of my
remaining healing potions, right? And I shove it

2434
02:46:56,260 --> 02:47:00,758
in his mouth like this, and it'll go
glug-glug-glug down him.

2435
02:47:00,815 --> 02:47:03,399
MARISHA: That happened so fast.

2436
02:47:03,399 --> 02:47:09,432
MATT: Eventually he's like, (panting)

2437
02:47:09,489 --> 02:47:10,851
LAURA: Hi, darling.

2438
02:47:10,851 --> 02:47:19,862
LIAM: I take him by the lapels. Things move very
fast with us. I don't think you understand what

2439
02:47:19,862 --> 02:47:22,859
you're asking for. If you think you can handle
that--

2440
02:47:22,859 --> 02:47:24,531
MATT: "Oh, Vax'ildan."

2441
02:47:24,531 --> 02:47:25,862
(laughter)

2442
02:47:25,924 --> 02:47:27,417
SAM: This is why he's single.

2443
02:47:27,417 --> 02:47:31,606
MATT: "I've heard of your work for quite some
time. Show me your ways."

2444
02:47:31,606 --> 02:47:40,822
LIAM: Illithid, all right? Beholders. Large white
dragons. I know it's cool to see her flash her

2445
02:47:40,822 --> 02:47:48,508
boobs and this one sing a song. It's all
excitement and craziness and all the rock and roll

2446
02:47:48,508 --> 02:47:57,858
that the kids are talking about. But listen to me.
It's dangerous. You could die any given day. So

2447
02:47:57,858 --> 02:48:04,264
could I, so could she, so could him. Maybe not
him, but the rest of us, sure. Are you really

2448
02:48:04,264 --> 02:48:05,994
interested in this?

2449
02:48:05,994 --> 02:48:08,239
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

2450
02:48:08,239 --> 02:48:11,038
LAURA: Why?

2451
02:48:11,038 --> 02:48:18,571
LIAM: Tough love. That's called tough love. It's
not bad. That's a ten plus-- can somebody pass me

2452
02:48:18,571 --> 02:48:21,003
that shit over there?

2453
02:48:21,003 --> 02:48:22,510
TALIESIN: Plus six.

2454
02:48:22,510 --> 02:48:23,766
LIAM: 16.

2455
02:48:23,766 --> 02:48:30,269
MATT: He looks at you for a second. His brow comes
together, and you can see there's a quiver to his

2456
02:48:30,269 --> 02:48:31,843
bottom lip. He goes--

2457
02:48:31,843 --> 02:48:36,875
TALIESIN: Wait, wait. There. There's his heart
breaking.

2458
02:48:36,875 --> 02:48:41,629
MATT: "I thought you were heroes. I waited two
weeks to meet you."

2459
02:48:41,629 --> 02:48:45,168
LAURA: How could you do that to him?

2460
02:48:45,168 --> 02:48:46,910
LIAM: Tell me your name again.

2461
02:48:46,910 --> 02:48:48,140
LAURA: Kynan.

2462
02:48:48,140 --> 02:48:54,347
MATT: "It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter at
all. You're right." And he puts his hand up and

2463
02:48:54,347 --> 02:48:58,396
pushes you away. He pulls out of your hands and
takes a few steps away and looks over his

2464
02:48:58,396 --> 02:49:01,558
shoulder. You can see now, there's tears welling
up in his eyes. He goes,

2465
02:49:01,558 --> 02:49:04,600
"I just wanted to be a hero."

2466
02:49:04,600 --> 02:49:05,578
SAM: Wait.

2467
02:49:05,578 --> 02:49:07,875
LIAM: Kynan! Kynan.

2468
02:49:07,875 --> 02:49:11,266
TRAVIS: Train him up.

2469
02:49:11,266 --> 02:49:13,274
SAM: Send him on a mission.

2470
02:49:13,274 --> 02:49:14,485
LIAM: Come back when you're ready.

2471
02:49:14,485 --> 02:49:15,992
SAM: No, send him on a mission.

2472
02:49:15,992 --> 02:49:30,889
LIAM: Come back when you're ready. Come back
again. Train yourself, and I, personally, will be

2473
02:49:30,889 --> 02:49:32,286
your mentor.

2474
02:49:32,286 --> 02:49:35,150
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

2475
02:49:35,150 --> 02:49:38,906
LAURA: Oh, you'd better roll good because I'm
going to be so mad at you if you hurt him.

2476
02:49:38,906 --> 02:49:45,969
LIAM: What's my persuasion? Oh, you passed it
down. All right. I make a seven.

2477
02:49:45,969 --> 02:49:48,921
MATT: He looks back at you, and the tears--

2478
02:49:48,921 --> 02:49:50,443
LIAM: I'm going to use Luck!

2479
02:49:50,443 --> 02:49:52,274
MATT: All right.

2480
02:49:52,274 --> 02:49:54,202
LIAM: It's a 20 on that one!

2481
02:49:54,202 --> 02:49:55,345
MATT: Natural 20?

2482
02:49:55,345 --> 02:49:56,263
LIAM: Yes.

2483
02:49:56,263 --> 02:50:01,307
MATT: He looks at you with the tears welling up in
his eyes. He blinks them away for a second.

2484
02:50:01,362 --> 02:50:03,064
(sniffs) "You mean that?"

2485
02:50:03,064 --> 02:50:15,625
LIAM: I do. You will be my right-hand man. I
promise.

2486
02:50:15,625 --> 02:50:20,366
MATT: He looks over at the rest of you. Looks at
Percy. Looks at Keyleth. Tiberius isn't there;

2487
02:50:20,366 --> 02:50:31,724
Tiberius has already walked into the keep. Looks
at Scanlan. Looks at Vex'ahlia. Looks at Grog. He

2488
02:50:31,724 --> 02:50:41,561
grasps the sword that's currently sheathed at his
side. "I will. I'll make you proud. I will be Vox

2489
02:50:41,561 --> 02:50:52,286
"Machina with you. I swear it. I swear it!" He runs
back to his tent, and you see him start gathering

2490
02:50:52,286 --> 02:50:58,680
up his things, and he begins tearing it down, and
you can see the tears are still coming, but he's

2491
02:50:58,680 --> 02:51:00,316
steeled his expression.

2492
02:51:00,316 --> 02:51:06,170
LIAM: I walk over to him. These people can't hear
this. I kneel down next to him, and I put my hand

2493
02:51:06,170 --> 02:51:17,028
on his shoulder and say, I was once like you and
didn't know what I wanted or where I was going. I

2494
02:51:17,028 --> 02:51:24,901
just want you to be ready. We've got some shit to
do. When we come back, we'll start over. You're

2495
02:51:24,901 --> 02:51:33,444
starting from ground zero. Starting from the
basement, you'll work your way up. And I promise,

2496
02:51:33,444 --> 02:51:38,998
I will be ready for you no matter what Mercer
throws at me. I promise.

2497
02:51:38,998 --> 02:51:40,757
SAM: Mercer's our god.

2498
02:51:40,757 --> 02:51:43,882
MATT: "All right."

2499
02:51:43,882 --> 02:51:50,642
LIAM: Don't question it. And I take him by the
hair. Don't question it. Come back. Right on his

2500
02:51:50,642 --> 02:51:51,638
forehead.

2501
02:51:51,638 --> 02:51:57,959
MATT: He gathers the rest of his tent and things,
piles it up, and he's speechless at this point.

2502
02:51:58,017 --> 02:52:05,278
You can see he's partially torn between wanting to
look hard and ready to do this, and also still

2503
02:52:05,278 --> 02:52:09,061
blown away by the fact that he's even encountered
you guys after all this time. He takes the rest of

2504
02:52:09,061 --> 02:52:14,607
his stuff and holds it in one arm and darts off
down the path towards the river, hops over it, and

2505
02:52:14,607 --> 02:52:17,809
then makes his way towards the rest of Emon and
vanishes into the distance.

2506
02:52:17,809 --> 02:52:19,909
MARISHA: You know, you might have just sent him to
his death.

2507
02:52:19,909 --> 02:52:22,095
LAURA: Why did you have to knock him out?!

2508
02:52:22,095 --> 02:52:23,548
LIAM: To go home and train?

2509
02:52:23,548 --> 02:52:25,787
LAURA: We could have trained him!

2510
02:52:25,787 --> 02:52:30,507
LIAM: We almost died ourselves in that temple, in
that pyramid.

2511
02:52:30,507 --> 02:52:32,794
MARISHA: You just put expectations in his head!

2512
02:52:32,794 --> 02:52:34,428
ORION: Are they inside yet?

2513
02:52:34,428 --> 02:52:36,792
LAURA: Yeah, we're walking inside.

2514
02:52:36,792 --> 02:52:39,763
LIAM: So we should have made him a full-fledged
member today, right now?

2515
02:52:39,763 --> 02:52:41,935
MARISHA: No, that's not what I'm saying at all.

2516
02:52:41,935 --> 02:52:43,815
LIAM: Make him a butler? He doesn't want to do
that.

2517
02:52:43,815 --> 02:52:47,130
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
you turn into the entrance of the keep, and there

2518
02:52:47,130 --> 02:52:50,585
standing, arms behind his back, is Tiberius.
Serious-faced.

2519
02:52:50,585 --> 02:52:56,338
ORION: I look right at Vax. Why did you do that to
that young man?

2520
02:52:56,338 --> 02:52:57,880
LIAM: He wasn't ready!

2521
02:52:57,880 --> 02:53:04,380
ORION: Stop it. It was aggressive beyond
necessity. We should have trialed the boy.

2522
02:53:04,380 --> 02:53:06,774
MARISHA: That was his trial.

2523
02:53:06,774 --> 02:53:08,202
ORION: That was not a trial!

2524
02:53:08,202 --> 02:53:10,242
SAM: We'll see, if he comes back.

2525
02:53:10,242 --> 02:53:16,375
ORION: You are far more powerful, Vax. You know
that. This boy was a fan, at best. We could have

2526
02:53:16,375 --> 02:53:18,227
put him to work, or something.

2527
02:53:18,227 --> 02:53:22,650
MARISHA: Do you think he would have been happy
with work? I'm not even happy that he told him to

2528
02:53:22,650 --> 02:53:26,868
go off and continue training. I think telling him
to go off and continue training is a bad idea.

2529
02:53:26,868 --> 02:53:35,920
LIAM: He now knows the facts. He knows his skill
level. He knows where he stands. He will either go

2530
02:53:35,920 --> 02:53:37,971
back to being a fishmonger--

2531
02:53:37,971 --> 02:53:39,895
SAM: Son of a butcher.

2532
02:53:39,895 --> 02:53:48,224
LIAM: Son of a butcher, well. Everyone has their
own personal path. Or he will come back to me, and

2533
02:53:48,224 --> 02:53:53,529
if he comes back to me, I will train him. If not,
it wasn't meant to be.

2534
02:53:53,529 --> 02:53:55,442
ORION: And if he comes for your head?

2535
02:53:55,442 --> 02:53:56,263
LAURA: He won't.

2536
02:53:56,263 --> 02:53:57,623
TRAVIS: Oh, he won't?

2537
02:53:57,623 --> 02:54:00,038
LIAM: I'll deal with that, as well.

2538
02:54:00,038 --> 02:54:01,863
TRAVIS: Did you never see The Incredibles?

2539
02:54:01,863 --> 02:54:04,460
(laughter)

2540
02:54:04,460 --> 02:54:05,815
ORION: Vax.

2541
02:54:05,815 --> 02:54:07,917
LIAM: Yes, Tiberius?

2542
02:54:07,917 --> 02:54:12,557
ORION: You and Grog I respect and fear the most
out of all of us. You are cunning.

2543
02:54:12,557 --> 02:54:14,315
SAM: What am I, chopped liver?

2544
02:54:14,315 --> 02:54:15,963
ORION: I could crush you in one blow, Scanlan.

2545
02:54:15,963 --> 02:54:19,368
SAM: Let's leave it at that.

2546
02:54:19,368 --> 02:54:27,291
ORION: Vex, I fear you and am slightly attracted
to you, as well. Grog and Vax, you are the

2547
02:54:27,291 --> 02:54:29,175
strongest and most noble and cunning--

2548
02:54:29,175 --> 02:54:33,861
SAM: You live because I let you live. Just needed
to say that out loud.

2549
02:54:33,861 --> 02:54:40,003
ORION: You believe what you believe. I'm just
saying, when it comes to things, sometimes you

2550
02:54:40,003 --> 02:54:47,535
really rush into stuff, and stop. Because you
could just be chill sometimes.

2551
02:54:47,535 --> 02:54:49,780
(laughter)

2552
02:54:49,780 --> 02:54:57,243
MATT: At which point, you hear a voice ring out
from across the courtyard of the keep. "Ah! You've

2553
02:54:57,243 --> 02:55:03,732
"all returned!" And you see across the way, Laina,
your joyful housekeeper, comes rushing out, arms

2554
02:55:03,732 --> 02:55:07,890
open to greet you all. You can see there's a
little bit of dirt on the front of her apron, like

2555
02:55:07,890 --> 02:55:13,319
she's been cutting the hedges or doing some sort
of garden work. She rushes out and hugs you. "It's

2556
02:55:13,319 --> 02:55:17,089
"been so long. It's been far too long. It's so good
to see all of you."

2557
02:55:17,089 --> 02:55:21,916
ORION: As I see her, I turn to greet, but I want
to give Vax a little pinch on the butt. A little

2558
02:55:21,916 --> 02:55:23,215
friendly pinch.

2559
02:55:23,215 --> 02:55:32,300
MATT: A little tweak. A little dragonborn tweak.
"Oh! Sorry, that reminds me. Hold on." And she

2560
02:55:32,300 --> 02:55:36,947
pulls out a little piece of paper. You recognize
it: it's used in various arcane messaging. She

2561
02:55:36,947 --> 02:55:43,688
pulls out a small quill and dabbles it and starts
writing a quick message on it. Closes the lid

2562
02:55:43,688 --> 02:55:45,800
(fire burst noise). It disappears.

2563
02:55:45,800 --> 02:55:47,989
MARISHA: What was that?

2564
02:55:47,989 --> 02:55:50,420
MATT: "I'm sorry. I was given that, just in case
you all returned--"

2565
02:55:50,420 --> 02:55:53,162
MARISHA: Who gave you that? What was that?

2566
02:55:53,162 --> 02:56:00,743
MATT: "Seeker Asum Emring of the council. The
ranger. He said as soon as you all returned, I'm

2567
02:56:00,743 --> 02:56:03,466
"supposed to let him know. He had very important
business with you."

2568
02:56:03,466 --> 02:56:07,969
LAURA: Maybe for the future, don't do that until
we tell you it's okay to do that?

2569
02:56:07,969 --> 02:56:14,432
SAM: Seeker Emring, you said? Of the council of
Tal'Dorei?

2570
02:56:14,432 --> 02:56:15,567
MATT: "Yes."

2571
02:56:15,567 --> 02:56:16,881
SAM: He's an ally.

2572
02:56:16,881 --> 02:56:21,661
LAURA: No, he's fine. It's just, maybe we wanted
to take a little nap or something.

2573
02:56:21,661 --> 02:56:22,755
MARISHA: Yes, ask us first.

2574
02:56:22,755 --> 02:56:27,920
MATT: "I'm sorry, I was-- oh. Okay. My apologies.
I was given implicit instructions by him."

2575
02:56:27,920 --> 02:56:34,952
ORION: It's all right, we forgive you. I give her
a hug. Sorry, I'm very scaly.

2576
02:56:34,952 --> 02:56:37,730
MATT: "Oh! Ah, it's good to see you, too, Lord
Tiberius Stormwind."

2577
02:56:37,730 --> 02:56:42,414
SAM: Could you instruct the security guard-- we
can take care of it. We should instruct the

2578
02:56:42,414 --> 02:56:47,741
security guards: if there's a tent outside the
keep, they should just burn it down.

2579
02:56:47,741 --> 02:56:56,052
MATT: "Oh, that nice boy! I brought him biscuits
every morning. He was so sweet, that one."

2580
02:56:56,052 --> 02:57:00,771
MARISHA: You brought him biscuits? Oh, she fed the
stray. That's adorable.

2581
02:57:00,771 --> 02:57:06,281
LIAM: Do me a favor. Roll up his tent, keep it
inside. If he comes back to ask for it--

2582
02:57:06,281 --> 02:57:07,901
MATT: He already rolled up his tent when he took
off.

2583
02:57:07,901 --> 02:57:09,049
LIAM: Did he leave anything?

2584
02:57:09,049 --> 02:57:11,691
MATT: There was a couple of small pots and pans
and things that he left.

2585
02:57:11,691 --> 02:57:16,368
LIAM: If he comes back, let him in. If I'm not
here, let him use my room for as long as he likes,

2586
02:57:16,368 --> 02:57:17,989
and I'll pay for it.

2587
02:57:17,989 --> 02:57:19,186
MATT: "Okay, it'll be done."

2588
02:57:19,186 --> 02:57:21,326
LAURA: Feeling guilty that you knocked him out,
brother?

2589
02:57:21,326 --> 02:57:24,314
LIAM: No, I feel perfectly justified.

2590
02:57:24,314 --> 02:57:25,884
ORION: Oh, you shouldn't.

2591
02:57:25,884 --> 02:57:29,707
TRAVIS: Can we rest before we go see this ranger?

2592
02:57:29,707 --> 02:57:30,816
SAM: Let's do it.

2593
02:57:30,816 --> 02:57:36,251
MATT: Right. You guys make your way into the keep. Laina
immediately rushes off to the kitchen and begins

2594
02:57:36,309 --> 02:57:40,660
preparing a welcome back meal for all of you. You
can smell, after the next ten to 15 minutes pass

2595
02:57:40,660 --> 02:57:46,259
by, that scent of freshly-cooked meats and baking
bread begins to fill the air around Greyskull

2596
02:57:46,259 --> 02:57:51,863
Keep. The halls are kept nice and warm. It's very
clean, and it's a very welcome sight to be back

2597
02:57:51,863 --> 02:58:00,047
home. You take time to rest and exhale and go over
the sequence, and as you walk by, you see across

2598
02:58:00,047 --> 02:58:09,700
the right from the main foyer, you can see a
little bit of the light echoing through from the

2599
02:58:09,700 --> 02:58:16,573
temple of Sarenrae, the stained glass, itself, and
for a moment you all take a sad memory of Pike,

2600
02:58:16,573 --> 02:58:19,781
whereever she is, hopefully to return to you very
soon.

2601
02:58:19,781 --> 02:58:22,034
MARISHA: It's just not home without her.

2602
02:58:22,034 --> 02:58:27,081
LAURA: Here's the thing, Scanlan, how do you look
through your poo? Can you look through it

2603
02:58:27,081 --> 02:58:28,638
anywhere, or is it perhaps from the--

2604
02:58:28,638 --> 02:58:35,862
SAM: If you'd like to. I'm feeling a little bit
Pike-sick right now.

2605
02:58:35,862 --> 02:58:39,307
I could concentrate very hard.

2606
02:58:39,307 --> 02:58:41,698
LAURA: Just concentrate for a moment and see what
she's doing.

2607
02:58:41,698 --> 02:58:43,390
LIAM: Would we be able to see, as well?

2608
02:58:43,390 --> 02:58:45,277
SAM: No, I'd have to describe to you what I see.

2609
02:58:45,277 --> 02:58:48,002
LAURA: Tell us what you see. Unless she's naked,
in which case, stop looking.

2610
02:58:48,002 --> 02:58:58,406
SAM: Of course, I would definitely stop looking if
I saw her naked in front of my poo. Definitely.

2611
02:58:58,406 --> 02:59:01,158
MATT: Are you...?

2612
02:59:01,158 --> 02:59:03,524
SAM: Sure, I'm going to try to scry through my
poo.

2613
02:59:03,524 --> 02:59:11,548
MATT: You sit down and close your eyes and begin
to concentrate, and as you begin to focus your

2614
02:59:11,548 --> 02:59:17,301
energy, the sense of the arcane mind itself has
gathered between the center of the head and the

2615
02:59:17,301 --> 02:59:21,715
center of the chest. You begin to join these in
the center, and your consciousness begins to glide

2616
02:59:21,715 --> 02:59:28,762
downward towards your bowels. Eventually, you find
a point of connection and you feel your vision

2617
02:59:28,762 --> 02:59:33,391
transcending this single point on the prime
material plane. You are brought through the small

2618
02:59:33,391 --> 02:59:39,001
channel across the astral sea to connect, and
suddenly your vision takes place. What looks like

2619
02:59:39,001 --> 02:59:44,594
a cluster of dirt to one side and a darkened
chamber that is lit by a series of torches. Before

2620
02:59:44,594 --> 02:59:53,123
you, you see, still and slightly muddled, the
Temple of Sarenrae as partially uncovered. You can

2621
02:59:53,123 --> 02:59:59,735
see the large stone archway that is the front of
the partially collapsed temple. You can see now

2622
02:59:59,735 --> 03:00:06,290
there is stone being brought down the wooden
staircase, and it is being used to slowly build up

2623
03:00:06,290 --> 03:00:12,631
and reconstruct what was once a beautiful and very
well-revered structure. You can see in the

2624
03:00:12,631 --> 03:00:19,520
distance a small, white-haired gnome figure that
is currently acting as foreman for this whole

2625
03:00:19,520 --> 03:00:26,417
construction process and is giving orders and
shouts to the other individuals here. Glancing

2626
03:00:26,417 --> 03:00:31,041
about, you see her step over, and one person trips
and drops a stone, and she walks up to them and

2627
03:00:31,041 --> 03:00:35,638
takes them by the shoulder and lifts them back up
and gives them a little hug, and then picks up the

2628
03:00:35,638 --> 03:00:39,251
stone and carries it with them over to where it
belongs on the side of one of the walls.

2629
03:00:39,251 --> 03:00:41,507
SAM: She should fire that person, but okay.

2630
03:00:41,642 --> 03:00:47,602
MATT: A few more moments pass and you gather that
this is a slow-moving, but a consistent moving,

2631
03:00:47,677 --> 03:00:51,989
renovation of the temple of Sarenrae, based on the
limited number of people that she has at her

2632
03:00:51,989 --> 03:00:54,702
disposal to help with the process. But it seems to
be going well.

2633
03:00:54,702 --> 03:00:57,198
SAM: (gasps)

2634
03:00:57,198 --> 03:00:58,594
LAURA: What did you see?

2635
03:00:58,594 --> 03:01:00,346
SAM: She was definitely naked.

2636
03:01:00,346 --> 03:01:01,448
ORION: Really?

2637
03:01:01,448 --> 03:01:13,002
SAM: No, she was supervising her crew in a fair,
but firm way. She was just being Pike: driven,

2638
03:01:13,002 --> 03:01:21,462
radiant, beautiful, and empowered by the spirit of 
Sarenrae. She's everything that we think of her

2639
03:01:21,509 --> 03:01:29,631
and more. She's beautiful and charming. Let's just
let it be known that I could kill Tiberius if

2640
03:01:29,631 --> 03:01:31,682
I wanted to. Just going to say that.

2641
03:01:31,682 --> 03:01:34,033
ORION: It's fine. Yes, you can, Scanlan.

2642
03:01:34,033 --> 03:01:39,279
SAM: Yes. I mean, that's beside the point. Pike
was glorious and wonderful and confident, and I

2643
03:01:39,357 --> 03:01:43,091
miss her so much. I hope from time to time
I can look in on her.

2644
03:01:43,213 --> 03:01:45,064
LAURA: Anytime you want.

2645
03:01:45,099 --> 03:01:46,698
TRAVIS: Look through your shit.

2646
03:01:46,698 --> 03:01:52,460
SAM: Well, it's really any bodily fluid, I
believe. I could piss. I could barf.

2647
03:01:52,460 --> 03:01:54,516
LAURA: Ooh! Any time ever?

2648
03:01:54,516 --> 03:01:59,408
TRAVIS: Is this real? Is it a real thing? Is it
real? He can do this?

2649
03:01:59,544 --> 03:02:05,273
MATT: There is a gradual fade to the effect.

2650
03:02:05,273 --> 03:02:07,919
LIAM: I'm raising my flask, and I say: To Pike.

2651
03:02:07,919 --> 03:02:09,133
ALL: To Pike.

2652
03:02:09,133 --> 03:02:11,526
LIAM: The best in all of us.

2653
03:02:11,526 --> 03:02:13,796
SAM: She really was, and is.

2654
03:02:13,796 --> 03:02:17,666
MARISHA: Our own little inspirational poster,
inside each and every one of us.

2655
03:02:17,666 --> 03:02:19,347
SAM: She's not little, but yes.

2656
03:02:19,347 --> 03:02:24,949
MATT: As you all drink, a familiar voice echoes
from across the hallway.

2657
03:02:24,949 --> 03:02:26,162
MARISHA: Pike?

2658
03:02:26,162 --> 03:02:28,010
MATT: "Your food is ready, everyone."

2659
03:02:28,010 --> 03:02:29,222
(groaning)

2660
03:02:29,222 --> 03:02:33,575
MATT: And you see Erwen Dastell, your elderly
halfling manservant, is there standing in his

2661
03:02:33,575 --> 03:02:39,651
attire, smiling, happy to see you all. "Laina
would like you all to know that your meal is

2662
03:02:39,651 --> 03:02:41,334
"ready. This way, please."

2663
03:02:41,334 --> 03:02:42,725
LAURA: Thank you, Erwen.

2664
03:02:42,725 --> 03:02:50,339
MATT: He leads you to the dining hall. The food is
already prepared, and you sit down to eat. The

2665
03:02:50,473 --> 03:02:54,742
meal is very welcome; it's the best food you've
had in a while. Comparable to Southern comfort

2666
03:02:54,776 --> 03:02:57,264
food. There's gravy, biscuits-- it's beautiful.

2667
03:02:57,264 --> 03:02:58,670
LAURA: Fried chicken.

2668
03:02:58,670 --> 03:03:05,930
MATT: (chuckles) It's delightful. A little ways
into the meal, you can see Cordell steps into the

2669
03:03:05,930 --> 03:03:12,958
room and glances in for a second. "I am sorry to
interrupt, but we have a visitor."

2670
03:03:12,958 --> 03:03:16,545
SAM: Is it a councilor from Tal'Dorei?

2671
03:03:16,545 --> 03:03:18,246
MATT: "It is. The halfling."

2672
03:03:18,246 --> 03:03:20,458
ORION: Invite him in for dinner.

2673
03:03:20,458 --> 03:03:21,929
LAURA: Does he want some fried chicken?

2674
03:03:21,971 --> 03:03:23,743
MATT: "I could ask."

2675
03:03:23,908 --> 03:03:27,003
MARISHA: Tell him if he's okay with us being a
little tipsy.

2676
03:03:27,003 --> 03:03:28,129
LAURA: Still?

2677
03:03:28,129 --> 03:03:30,779
MARISHA: Well, I figured we just kept going.

2678
03:03:30,779 --> 03:03:44,323
MATT: A moment goes by, and you see Seeker Asum
Emring arrives at the doorway. He's wearing dark,

2679
03:03:44,495 --> 03:03:50,596
looks like studded leather armor, a very deep
green cloak about his shoulders. Even at the

2680
03:03:50,596 --> 03:03:56,457
council meetings, he's dressed for utility. He
seems to be that individual who has his eye in

2681
03:03:56,457 --> 03:04:04,408
many places in the room at once; he's a ranger by
trade, and paranoid by nature. His head is shaved

2682
03:04:04,408 --> 03:04:09,757
bald, and he has tattoos across one side of his
halfling face. As he walks in, he gives a swift

2683
03:04:09,757 --> 03:04:17,637
bow and says to everyone, "Greetings. I'm sorry to
interrupt your meal. I was notified that you have

2684
03:04:17,637 --> 03:04:23,436
"arrived, and I have business I would like to
discuss, if you have a moment."

2685
03:04:23,436 --> 03:04:28,563
MARISHA: (groans) Is it bad news? We're not in the
mood for bad news.

2686
03:04:28,612 --> 03:04:32,680
MATT: "I'm all right. It's not bad news, it's just
something I wanted to run by the rest of you."

2687
03:04:32,680 --> 03:04:34,902
TRAVIS: Please feel free to speak.

2688
03:04:34,902 --> 03:04:39,725
MATT: He steps and finds a chair at one of
the nearby tables, clustered towards the center,

2689
03:04:39,790 --> 03:04:48,267
where you guys have pushed your dining tables
together. "Now, while you were gone, a venture has

2690
03:04:48,313 --> 03:04:54,560
"been put into motion. In celebration of the
agreed-upon construction of a grand bridge across

2691
03:04:54,560 --> 03:05:00,321
"the Shearing Channel to the eastern continent of
Wynandia, a dinner is being held here within a

2692
03:05:00,321 --> 03:05:09,432
"week. This venture is helmed by one Lord and Lady
Briarwood of Whitestone, as the bridge would be

2693
03:05:09,432 --> 03:05:16,588
"set at the edge of the Alabaster Sierras. They are
probably en route as we speak. The bridge shall

2694
03:05:16,588 --> 03:05:24,254
"open trade routes with the kingdom of Wildmount
across the way. I'm here because few things escape

2695
03:05:24,254 --> 03:05:33,868
"my eye. Percival, when last we were company, you
had shifted so very uncomfortably at the mention

2696
03:05:33,868 --> 03:05:37,389
"of these two. May I ask why?"

2697
03:05:37,389 --> 03:05:39,204
TALIESIN: Had I? I hadn't noticed.

2698
03:05:39,204 --> 03:05:40,819
MATT: "Well, I did."

2699
03:05:40,819 --> 03:05:49,574
TALIESIN: I have had dealings with them before. I
find them... untrustworthy.

2700
03:05:49,574 --> 03:05:57,009
MATT: "I have my reservations, as well. My network
has been watching their acquisition of Whitestone

2701
03:05:57,009 --> 03:06:03,927
"since the de Rolo family fell to disease, and
there are far more questions than answers. I've

2702
03:06:03,927 --> 03:06:09,179
"sent operatives to inquire, but each has sent me a
letter of resignation instead of choosing to stay

2703
03:06:09,179 --> 03:06:16,707
"within Whitestone under my employ. Now, our sovereign
requested that I extend an invitation to this

2704
03:06:16,840 --> 03:06:24,430
"coming dinner-- per your request to him, Percy--
to you, Vox Machina. I am here to ask if you will

2705
03:06:24,430 --> 03:06:30,202
"attend, and if so, if I can trust you to keep an
eye while I do my work."

2706
03:06:30,202 --> 03:06:33,333
LAURA: What say you, Percy?

2707
03:06:33,333 --> 03:06:35,223
TRAVIS: It's Percy's call.

2708
03:06:35,223 --> 03:06:42,744
TALIESIN: (sighs) Yes, we will attend.

2709
03:06:42,744 --> 03:06:49,186
MATT: "Very good. I will contact you in the next
few days and shall discuss further. Until then,

2710
03:06:49,186 --> 03:06:53,447
"enjoy the rest of your meal, and thank you." He
sits up from his seat.

2711
03:06:53,447 --> 03:06:55,987
SAM: We're having bread pudding for dessert.

2712
03:06:55,987 --> 03:06:58,216
MATT: "I'm good, thank you."

2713
03:06:58,216 --> 03:07:00,609
MARISHA: Wait, when did you say this dinner was
taking place?

2714
03:07:00,609 --> 03:07:02,886
MATT: "In about a week, they should be arriving."

2715
03:07:02,886 --> 03:07:05,828
TALIESIN: Excuse me. I have a bit of work to do
downstairs.

2716
03:07:05,828 --> 03:07:08,084
SAM: Can we go to Kraghammer in that?

2717
03:07:08,084 --> 03:07:11,379
LAURA: Seven days in a week or in a week, like
five days?

2718
03:07:11,379 --> 03:07:16,727
MATT: "They are expected to arrive in the next
five to seven days. The dinner is set for seven to

2719
03:07:16,727 --> 03:07:17,859
"eight days from now."

2720
03:07:17,859 --> 03:07:18,970
LAURA: Got it.

2721
03:07:18,970 --> 03:07:23,564
SAM: Thank you for your information.

2722
03:07:23,564 --> 03:07:25,709
MATT: "Of course. We shall discuss further."

2723
03:07:25,709 --> 03:07:26,802
LAURA: Percy--

2724
03:07:26,802 --> 03:07:28,093
TALIESIN: I've already gone.

2725
03:07:28,093 --> 03:07:30,058
ORION: Oh, what is the attire for the event?

2726
03:07:30,058 --> 03:07:36,413
MATT: "As formal as one may muster. If you do not
have suitable attire, it will be provided, but

2727
03:07:36,413 --> 03:07:38,177
"please do notify the council."

2728
03:07:38,177 --> 03:07:40,090
SAM: I could lend you one of my jackets.

2729
03:07:40,090 --> 03:07:41,936
ORION: I'd like to see what they propose.

2730
03:07:41,936 --> 03:07:45,316
TRAVIS: I don't really do formal, so?

2731
03:07:45,316 --> 03:07:47,685
LAURA: Don't worry, Grog. We have a wonderful
tailor.

2732
03:07:47,685 --> 03:07:50,380
LIAM: The fancy clothes in the bag.

2733
03:07:50,380 --> 03:07:52,249
LAURA: In your Bag of Holding.

2734
03:07:52,249 --> 03:07:54,693
TRAVIS: We've got like two left, and they wouldn't
fit me.

2735
03:07:54,693 --> 03:07:59,196
MATT: "You can figure this out amongst yourselves.
I have business to attend to. Have a good night."

2736
03:07:59,196 --> 03:08:00,752
LIAM: We'll be there. Thank you.

2737
03:08:00,752 --> 03:08:04,609
MATT: "Of course." And with that, he turns around
and leaves. He's one of those individuals where as

2738
03:08:04,609 --> 03:08:09,258
he walks away, and this catches your eye in
particular, for a moment you have to admire the

2739
03:08:09,258 --> 03:08:14,267
fact that he takes naught but two steps and for a
second, you swear he was walking, he had about 15

2740
03:08:14,324 --> 03:08:16,698
feet to the door, and he's just gone.

2741
03:08:16,698 --> 03:08:18,175
LAURA: He's good.

2742
03:08:18,175 --> 03:08:22,320
MATT: And with that, we shall end this week's
session.

2743
03:08:22,320 --> 03:08:23,735
(groaning)

2744
03:08:23,735 --> 03:08:25,223
LAURA: Oh, but I want to talk to Percy!

2745
03:08:25,223 --> 03:08:28,808
MARISHA: I know! Percy just ran off to the
basement, to his workshop.

2746
03:08:28,808 --> 03:08:31,499
MATT: We'll pick up directly from this moment next
week.

2747
03:08:31,499 --> 03:08:35,304
MARISHA: Guys, I feel like we need to have a
conversation with Percy.

2748
03:08:35,304 --> 03:08:37,277
LAURA: Yeah, that needs to happen.

2749
03:08:37,277 --> 03:08:39,348
TALIESIN: (screams)

2750
03:08:39,348 --> 03:08:41,581
(laughter)

2751
03:08:41,581 --> 03:08:45,919
LIAM: So, Percy, do you want to strike off in a
random direction and just go and go and go?

2752
03:08:45,919 --> 03:08:54,479
TALIESIN: So, that money that we're owed. Why
don't we do that? I think we have time for that.

2753
03:08:54,479 --> 03:08:57,065
MARISHA: Maybe we could send an errand-boy to get
it?

2754
03:08:57,065 --> 03:08:59,113
SAM: We're back, guys. We're back!

2755
03:08:59,113 --> 03:52:16,481
