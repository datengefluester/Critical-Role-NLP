00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,426
MATT: Hello, and welcome to this evening's episode
of Critical Role! We'll be with you in just a

2
00:00:04,494 --> 00:00:08,374
second. Unfortunately we're down a Travis
Willingham tonight, but in Grog's stead we have

3
00:00:08,374 --> 00:00:13,673
the rest of the party venturing forth into the Emberhold after
just recently discovering Lady Kima. We shall see

4
00:00:13,673 --> 00:00:16,712
what happens very shortly, but in the meantime,
let's go ahead and

5
00:00:16,712 --> 00:00:19,613
give you guys some character backstory.

6
00:00:19,613 --> 00:01:28,077
[dramatic music]

7
00:01:28,077 --> 00:01:32,935
ASHLEY: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town,
near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family

8
00:01:32,935 --> 00:01:38,692
of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable
reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery

9
00:01:38,692 --> 00:01:44,684
left them with the curse of the last name
Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and

10
00:01:44,684 --> 00:01:49,754
redemption, had other plans for Pike's
great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his

11
00:01:49,754 --> 00:01:55,741
family at a young age after a dream, a dream that
changed the course of the Trickfoot family.

12
00:01:55,741 --> 00:02:01,526
Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae, and pledged
from then on that him and his family would live a

13
00:02:01,526 --> 00:02:08,860
life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike
seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was

14
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:15,314
animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had
a purpose in making things whole that had once

15
00:02:15,314 --> 00:02:21,350
been broken. She studied and learned the ways to
heal through divine magic. She lived a peaceful

16
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:27,826
life, quiet and simple, until one day Wilhand was
captured and almost killed by a group of goliath

17
00:02:27,826 --> 00:02:33,634
barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand
against the murder of the innocent gnome, and he

18
00:02:33,634 --> 00:02:40,600
himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead,
abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for

19
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:47,730
help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best
she could, bringing him back to life. When he

20
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:55,610
awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw.
After that, they were the best of friends, a

21
00:02:55,679 --> 00:03:02,244
rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in
a few years' time Grog would soon return the favor

22
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:09,977
and bring her back from the clutches of death.
(roaring, crunch) After being killed in battle,

23
00:03:09,977 --> 00:03:16,349
Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that
it would never happen again. She spent four months

24
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:22,439
at sea, training with the men and women aboard a
ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy

25
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:29,758
symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the
other, this time, Pike is ready.

26
00:03:29,758 --> 00:03:38,917
TRAVIS: Right, listen up! If you have ale, then
you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of

27
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:46,625
towering height and size, this barbarian has an
appetite for the two great loves in his life:

28
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:57,624
combat, women, and ale. Wait... Easily the brains
of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast

29
00:03:57,624 --> 00:04:06,366
knowledge of shapes, colors, and shiny things.
Also ale. In his early years, armed with his

30
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:12,101
two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving
his might amongst the ranks of his family's

31
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:18,638
wandering herd. But after coming upon an
unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he

32
00:04:18,638 --> 00:04:26,543
objected to the killing of such an innocent life.
A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for

33
00:04:26,543 --> 00:04:36,637
this terrified little thing. His disobedience cost
him dearly. Beaten bloody and banished by the herd

34
00:04:36,637 --> 00:04:44,941
leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and
left to die. Exiled from his herd, it was then

35
00:04:44,941 --> 00:04:52,572
that the relative of the very gnome he fought to
save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome

36
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:59,683
cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him
back from death's edge. And they have remained

37
00:04:59,683 --> 00:05:07,182
close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be
found challenging entire taverns to wrestling

38
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:17,292
matches! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest
house where you pay for lady favors. Also ale.

39
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:22,507
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth would leave
you with little information on the half-elven

40
00:05:22,507 --> 00:05:27,819
druid. You might even think that her social
awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is

41
00:05:27,876 --> 00:05:34,599
kind of sweet. Of course, it would be unwise to
underestimate her based on first impressions.

42
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:41,040
Under that unintimidating petite frame is a
vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose

43
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:47,112
natural powers have made even the fiercest of
champions pee their pants. Literally. (laughs)

44
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:53,294
Born to the Air tribe of the Ashari people,
Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and

45
00:05:53,294 --> 00:05:59,164
the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent
duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei,

46
00:05:59,164 --> 00:06:05,306
where the four elemental planes begin to bleed
with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she

47
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:10,806
had quite a knack for air manipulation and
beast-shaping abilities. Well, if you consider

48
00:06:10,806 --> 00:06:18,127
kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts.
Which, I do. Anyways, it wasn't long before the

49
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:23,952
headmaster of the tribe, her father, Korren,
realized her true prodigious abilities and she was

50
00:06:23,952 --> 00:06:30,783
inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster.
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped

51
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:36,099
and replaced with endless spell memorization,
teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly

52
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:42,113
high expectations. Every druid leader to be must
embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes

53
00:06:42,113 --> 00:06:48,184
in order to introduce and establish respect
amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the

54
00:06:48,184 --> 00:06:54,600
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt
she was ready, he set her on the path to truly

55
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:01,202
discovering herself, not knowing when, or if she
will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain

56
00:07:01,202 --> 00:07:07,478
towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead.
Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong

57
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:14,417
warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and
compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one

58
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:21,213
thought plays in repeat in her mind: is she even
worthy?

59
00:07:21,213 --> 00:07:26,771
TALIESIN: Percy was the third of seven
children, born to a noble family who lived far to

60
00:07:26,771 --> 00:07:32,073
the north, in the ancient castle of Whitestone.
With so many siblings to share the burdens of

61
00:07:32,073 --> 00:07:39,101
lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the
sciences, engineering and naturalism. One day, a

62
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:44,819
mysterious couple, named Lord and Lady Briarwood,
came to court. During a feast held in their honor,

63
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:50,066
the Briarwoods violently took control of the
castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would

64
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:56,253
stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the
dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister.

65
00:07:56,253 --> 00:08:03,421
Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men.
As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to

66
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:09,267
the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually
jumping into a freezing river and floating

67
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:15,220
unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking
up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the

68
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:21,920
next two years, as he slowly made his way as far
south as possible. Then, one night, Percy had a

69
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:28,271
dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him
vengeance against those who destroyed his family.

70
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:35,652
When he awoke, Percy began to design his first
gun. (gunshot)

71
00:08:35,652 --> 00:08:41,330
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?
Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his

72
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:47,222
eye on you. A talented musician, master of
disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind,

73
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:55,138
Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his
own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his

74
00:08:55,138 --> 00:09:00,812
endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for
coin and support his single mother. One day he was

75
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:07,121
discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr.
Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe where he

76
00:09:07,121 --> 00:09:13,379
learned the ways of the world, and honed his
skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of

77
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:17,843
his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms
with the violent death of his mother at the hands

78
00:09:17,843 --> 00:09:23,933
of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road
provided many, shall we say, educational

79
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:30,064
experiences with the opposite sex, deep down
Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known:

80
00:09:30,064 --> 00:09:37,937
the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan
considers himself a lover first, performer second,

81
00:09:37,937 --> 00:09:44,180
and fighter distant third. On the battlefield,
he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood

82
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:50,962
unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count
on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song,

83
00:09:50,962 --> 00:09:57,221
and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and
makes the females swoon.

84
00:09:57,221 --> 00:10:04,743
ORION: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius
Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

85
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:10,907
located in the heart of Draconia, born from a
politically respected family. At the age of 15, I

86
00:10:10,907 --> 00:10:16,105
succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing
prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and

87
00:10:16,105 --> 00:10:20,653
the Draconian High Council were amazed at how
powerful my spells were for how long I had been

88
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:25,357
training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest
appointed member of the Magic Guild in Draconian

89
00:10:25,357 --> 00:10:31,518
history. For the next few years, I almost went mad
from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's

90
00:10:31,518 --> 00:10:38,134
rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a
chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room

91
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:43,294
were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding
cities and areas around the known world. For

92
00:10:43,294 --> 00:10:48,467
months I would frequent the chamber, and learned
of artifacts from legend. After a long period of

93
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:52,949
research, I made a list of artifacts that caught
my eye. I brought these findings to the high

94
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:57,714
council and was told that all of the information
in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either

95
00:10:57,714 --> 00:11:03,580
believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries,
and hence were lost forever. I found those answers

96
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:09,370
to be unacceptable. A year later I devised a ruse
and managed to convince the city council to lend

97
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:14,597
support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of
peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms,

98
00:11:14,597 --> 00:11:19,584
going from town to town and making friends and
allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a

99
00:11:19,653 --> 00:11:25,581
red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands
in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed,

100
00:11:25,581 --> 00:11:31,505
so I could explore the world and find these
artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some

101
00:11:31,505 --> 00:11:37,321
may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock
to all that. I am much sharper than most give me

102
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:42,866
credit for. I just don't pay attention to things
sometimes. I've also been known to be rather

103
00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:50,300
cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well,
dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales

104
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:56,550
every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite
friendly for a dragonborn.

105
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:01,830
LIAM: Never entirely welcome in the company of
elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to

106
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:08,241
skip past formality, preferring instead to invite
himself in your door. Along with twin sister

107
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:15,460
Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter
between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised

108
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,838
by their mother in their early years, the twins
were eventually sent off to their father in the

109
00:12:19,838 --> 00:12:25,833
elven capital of Syngorn, but their cool reception
among the elves there never warmed, and their time

110
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:31,393
in the capital didn't last. The siblings stole
away one autumn night and set out on the open

111
00:12:31,393 --> 00:12:37,421
road. After a few years of wandering, they
eventually decided to return to their mother, and

112
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:43,059
journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But
instead of finding their childhood home, they

113
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:49,817
returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was
gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the

114
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:59,217
townspeople for answers, they learned of the day
the dragon came. With their ties all severed,

115
00:12:59,217 --> 00:13:06,111
Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their
fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since

116
00:13:06,111 --> 00:13:12,601
birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's
challenges in his own particular way, often by

117
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:20,562
sidestepping them entirely. And when his knack for
circumventing adversity isn't enough, the way of

118
00:13:20,562 --> 00:13:25,880
blades the elves schooled him in more than makes
up the difference.

119
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,747
LAURA: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has
spent most of her life suffering the cool

120
00:13:30,747 --> 00:13:37,981
reception of a people who don't fully accept her.
Born of a human mother and an elven father who

121
00:13:37,981 --> 00:13:43,271
only later in life took an interest in their
existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother

122
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:50,943
Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they
could truly rely on in this world were each other.

123
00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:56,230
It was at the age of ten when the two were taken
from their mother, and brought to live in Syngorn,

124
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:03,110
the isolated elven city for which their father was
an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always

125
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:09,753
kept an icy distance, and after too many years of
disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his

126
00:14:09,753 --> 00:14:17,760
indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax
took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and

127
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:25,716
learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to
the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the

128
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:32,874
keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track,
to spy and to shoot. And through a series of

129
00:14:32,874 --> 00:14:40,765
fateful events, earned herself a companion in the
form of a bear, her own stolen Trinket, to fight

130
00:14:40,765 --> 00:14:50,186
alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also, he
is adorable, and gives expert massages.

131
00:14:50,186 --> 00:15:57,413
[dramatic music]

132
00:15:57,474 --> 00:16:02,208
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome back to the next
episode of Critical Role. We unfortunately are

133
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,152
down one Grog this evening, as I mentioned
before.

134
00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:06,026
ALL: (distressed noises)

135
00:16:06,026 --> 00:16:11,999
MATT: We are missing him terribly. We'll see what
terrors will transpire in his absence. However,

136
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:15,356
though! We do have some fun things to announce
real fast: first off, we're still giving away

137
00:16:15,356 --> 00:16:21,178
promo kits for every 50 subscribers we get, so
we'll be having those randomly drawn from everyone

138
00:16:21,178 --> 00:16:26,501
in the chat room every time 50 subscribers are
joined to the channel, I guess you would say.

139
00:16:26,501 --> 00:16:31,004
Also, every ten subscribers we're giving away
Steam keys for different games, so also cool

140
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:38,135
giveaways, which is kind of fun. I want to take a
moment also to mention our... charity, there,

141
00:16:38,135 --> 00:16:40,186
that's the word I was looking for, it's been a
long day.

142
00:16:40,186 --> 00:16:41,301
(laughter)

143
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:45,408
MATT: Our charity, 826LA, which we're putting up
links in the chat room for you guys if you're

144
00:16:45,408 --> 00:16:51,202
able to donate. It's a fantastic program that
tutors children, helps with creative writing and

145
00:16:51,202 --> 00:16:56,408
general literacy skills. It's a wonderful program,
you can look it up at 826LA, you should Google it,

146
00:16:56,408 --> 00:16:59,938
find the website, it has all the information you
need. It's a really great charity and we're still

147
00:16:59,938 --> 00:17:03,693
pushing that through our show every week, so thank
you for all who have donated, and if you have the

148
00:17:03,693 --> 00:17:10,749
opportunity to, I highly recommend it. Also! I
wanted to let you guys know we have-- Marisha

149
00:17:10,749 --> 00:17:15,157
wants to mention a cool sponsor tonight or at
least a promotional push we're pushing.

150
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:20,439
MARISHA: Yes! Yes! Friends of the show, Espionage
Cosmetics, hooked us all up with some awesome

151
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:31,578
nerdy manicures. We'll tweet pictures of our
nails, so yes, we're all wearing awesome nails and

152
00:17:31,578 --> 00:17:37,811
we're going to be doing a giveaway from Espionage.
Their tabletop bath bombs,

153
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:41,246
which are awesome d20s--

154
00:17:41,246 --> 00:17:42,888
MATT: d10s, technically.

155
00:17:42,888 --> 00:17:47,358
MARISHA: Oh, d10s-- No, there's a d20! There's a
d10 and there's a percentile die!

156
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:50,570
MATT: No, you're right! I saw the wrong side of
it, my apologies. Forget I said anything.

157
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,743
MARISHA: So yes, and we'll probably also go ahead
and throw in a Critical Role signed picture as

158
00:17:54,743 --> 00:18:00,622
well with this. What you have to do is tweet
@EspionageMakeup, is their twitter,

159
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:07,669
@EspionageMakeup and #CriticalRole, and tell them
what your favorite character is from Critical Role

160
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:13,840
and who your favorite nail wraps are today and then
we'll pick at half-time a winner.

161
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,396
MATT: Indeed. So fantastic. I may have some more
stuff down the road we'll be able to talk about

162
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:21,682
but in the meantime, let's go ahead and get
everyone caught up to speed with what has transpired

163
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:28,313
recently on Critical Role. So the party, to give
you a quick overview for those who have just

164
00:18:28,313 --> 00:18:34,748
joined us, they were given a mission to seek out a
female halfling paladin named Lady Kima of Vord,

165
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:39,666
who had been missing, going on a vision quest,
apparently seeking some deep, dark evil that had

166
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:47,617
begun to simmer and grow beneath the dwarven city
of Kraghammer. The party managed to make their way

167
00:18:47,617 --> 00:18:53,025
to the city, delve deep within its caverns to
discover an entire series of caves, and what

168
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:58,786
eventually led to the Underdark itself. A
subterranean landscape of terror and darkness.

169
00:18:58,786 --> 00:19:04,504
After a series of battles with some duergar, which
are kinda ashy-skinned evil dwarven offshoot

170
00:19:04,504 --> 00:19:11,721
people, characters, and a few brushes with some
illithids or mind flayer creatures, they managed

171
00:19:11,721 --> 00:19:17,589
to befriend one, or I should say, ally with one
named Clarota. Who has been traveling with them,

172
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:22,898
who has apparently been kicked away from his
society and wishes reentry to save them from the

173
00:19:22,898 --> 00:19:34,082
kind of ominous presence of this unseen, barely
spoken entity called K'vorn. K'varn.

174
00:19:34,082 --> 00:19:35,223
(laughter)

175
00:19:35,223 --> 00:19:41,090
MATT: Long day. Long day. So upon traveling deep
into the recesses--

176
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,117
SAM: Don't worry Matt, you just have to talk
for three straight hours.

177
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:44,506
MATT: (laughs) I know. I know.

178
00:19:44,506 --> 00:19:46,417
(laughter)

179
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:48,105
MARISHA: Your day is just getting started.

180
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,526
MATT: I know. But yes, so they have now, after a
series of battles, found their way into the

181
00:19:52,526 --> 00:20:00,372
magma-covered, kind of obsidian jagged caverns
where the Emberhold, the duergar fortress

182
00:20:00,372 --> 00:20:05,464
currently resides, where they believe Lady Kima
was. Upon finding a way in, unfortunately

183
00:20:05,464 --> 00:20:09,666
announcing their presence to the fortress itself,
they managed to find Lady Kima in a torture

184
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:16,058
chamber beneath Emberhold, save her, slay her
oppressor, and now they have, after a tenuous

185
00:20:16,058 --> 00:20:20,680
alliance was made-- as Lady Kima and their
mind-flayer friend Clarota are very much at odds--

186
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:25,908
a very tenuous alliance was forged. And they now
journey back up to the main basement floor, or

187
00:20:25,908 --> 00:20:31,997
main base floor of the Emberhold proper. And
that's where we left off last time. So, hope you

188
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,264
can absorb all that, guys. (laughs)

189
00:20:34,264 --> 00:20:37,284
SAM: We are inside this fortress.

190
00:20:37,284 --> 00:20:38,487
MATT: Correct.

191
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,491
SAM: We are moving towards the armory. We're
trying to find the armory or something,

192
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:42,636
is that right?

193
00:20:42,636 --> 00:20:47,789
MATT: You're trying to find, essentially-- Lady
Kima has mentioned she wants to find the rest of

194
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:53,953
her equipment that she says is either in an
armory, or she mentioned a vault. And also she

195
00:20:53,953 --> 00:21:02,576
knows-- she mentioned something about vengeance to
those who run the keep. So she stormed up.

196
00:21:02,576 --> 00:21:03,962
LAURA: We're following her, right?

197
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,855
MATT: You've followed her back into the base floor
of the Emberhold itself. You all currently are now

198
00:21:06,855 --> 00:21:11,078
back kinda where you started after you snuck into
the side passage of the Emberhold.

199
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:13,738
LAURA: And she said she would lead the way to the
vault?

200
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:22,988
SAM: Can we be quiet for a second and see if
there's any footsteps around us or guards marching

201
00:21:22,988 --> 00:21:26,338
around? Are we in immediate peril or do we have a
second?

202
00:21:26,338 --> 00:21:28,486
MATT: Certainly. Everyone go ahead and make an
immediate perception roll.

203
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:29,864
SAM: Okay.

204
00:21:29,864 --> 00:21:31,910
LAURA: So fast!

205
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:36,217
MARISHA: Website went live, if you want to
announce that now or later.

206
00:21:36,217 --> 00:21:39,722
MATT: Later. Two?

207
00:21:39,722 --> 00:21:40,963
LAURA: No, 22! (laughs)

208
00:21:40,963 --> 00:21:42,407
LIAM: 28.

209
00:21:42,407 --> 00:21:43,268
ASHLEY: 13.

210
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,208
TALIESIN: 24.

211
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,190
ORION: Fail.

212
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,324
SAM: Ten. (laughs)

213
00:21:46,324 --> 00:21:50,464
MATT: That's a fail! All right, so-- You've got to
be ready!

214
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:53,865
MARISHA: 27!

215
00:21:53,865 --> 00:21:54,968
MATT: Okay.

216
00:21:54,968 --> 00:21:56,689
(laughter)

217
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:58,264
SAM: I'm sure he'll give you half of that.

218
00:21:58,264 --> 00:22:06,198
MATT: Nearly at the ready. All right, so as you
all take a moment and kind of steel yourselves,

219
00:22:06,198 --> 00:22:12,498
your ears perk up and you can hear what sounds
like echoes of distant footsteps down hallways,

220
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:17,503
far out of sight. You hear some movement across
the stone ceiling above you that eventually comes

221
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:23,525
to a stop. And you wait for about a minute, and
the entire place is now in a very eerie silence.

222
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:27,221
LIAM: They know we're here, still.

223
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,905
LAURA: But they don't know where we are.

224
00:22:28,905 --> 00:22:30,421
LIAM: No.

225
00:22:30,421 --> 00:22:32,525
ORION: Maybe they went to sleep?

226
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:35,713
TALIESIN: Lady Kima, do you remember where the
vault is?

227
00:22:35,713 --> 00:22:38,531
Do you remember how we can get back there?

228
00:22:38,531 --> 00:22:42,270
MATT: Kima turns to you, her eyes still peering
back, and she's creeping towards the edge of the

229
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:47,260
hallway. She looks back at you, briefly, and says,
"I've only seen half of this stronghold before

230
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:53,230
"they captured me. As far as I know, probably
somewhere on the second floor."

231
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,441
LAURA: What floor are we on now?

232
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:57,773
MATT: "The ground floor."

233
00:22:57,773 --> 00:22:59,177
LIAM: The ground floor.

234
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,337
LAURA: Right, cool.

235
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,806
ASHLEY: So it's just one up?

236
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:03,021
(laughter)

237
00:23:03,021 --> 00:23:04,209
MATT: "Apparently."

238
00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:09,888
LIAM: Were there stairs-- When we went down that
set of stairs there, was there also stairs going

239
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,203
up right there, or stairs going up?

240
00:23:12,203 --> 00:23:13,917
MATT: There were stairs-- Right there? No. There
were stairs going up

241
00:23:13,917 --> 00:23:15,411
in the first room you entered.

242
00:23:15,411 --> 00:23:17,337
LAURA: Oh, right! So we could go back in the
little storage room.

243
00:23:17,337 --> 00:23:18,640
LIAM: We could.

244
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,871
LAURA: And go up.

245
00:23:19,871 --> 00:23:22,245
LIAM: We should just spend the next three hours in
the storage room.

246
00:23:22,245 --> 00:23:24,115
LAURA: Let's go in the storage room and go up.

247
00:23:24,115 --> 00:23:32,032
LIAM: Lady Kima, allow me to take a peek around
the corner, see what's going on.

248
00:23:32,032 --> 00:23:33,313
So I'm gonna go stealth.

249
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:34,499
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll stealth.

250
00:23:34,499 --> 00:23:38,090
LIAM: And inch past her. That's good. 29.

251
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:45,443
MATT: 29? All right. She begrudgingly steps back.
You can see there's that eagerness to get in some

252
00:23:45,443 --> 00:23:50,278
sort of a fray or to feel somebody else bash along
the side of this greatsword that she borrowed from

253
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:59,826
you guys. She lets you pass. You creep up along
the edge. As you do, you see-- back here there is,

254
00:23:59,826 --> 00:24:06,146
in the middle of this hallway, a series of
doorways, and what looks to be a large room in the

255
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:09,939
center of the chamber where two duergar currently
stand.

256
00:24:09,939 --> 00:24:20,408
LIAM: I turn back to the group.

257
00:24:20,408 --> 00:24:23,408
TALIESIN: (whispers) How
about the other way?

258
00:24:23,408 --> 00:24:25,183
SAM: Why don't we just kill them?

259
00:24:25,249 --> 00:24:27,280
LIAM: Isn't that a corner-- a dead-on corner right
there?

260
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,666
MATT: This is another hallway.

261
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,172
LIAM: Another hallway.

262
00:24:30,172 --> 00:24:34,995
SAM: Let's go kill the duergar.

263
00:24:34,995 --> 00:24:37,118
LAURA: How dark is it in here? Is it like--

264
00:24:37,118 --> 00:24:41,468
MATT: No. It's pretty dark in here. Like, with low
light vision, you're able to see maybe a good 30

265
00:24:41,468 --> 00:24:46,853
to 40 feet ahead of you. There are a few of those
red crystal clusters that give off a little bit of

266
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:52,526
light, incrementally, but duergar themselves,
you've gotten to the point where you see they like

267
00:24:52,526 --> 00:24:56,669
it very, very dark. They actually aren't needing
light. This is more of a courtesy to guests they

268
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:57,645
may have.

269
00:24:57,645 --> 00:25:01,455
LAURA: So potentially, brother, we could take them
both out if you throw your knife

270
00:25:01,455 --> 00:25:03,025
and I do an arrow.

271
00:25:03,025 --> 00:25:06,582
ORION: Wait, didn't we see further past that,
'cause that's where Grog did the--

272
00:25:06,637 --> 00:25:07,737
(crushing noise)

273
00:25:07,737 --> 00:25:09,163
SAM: No, this is the area that we haven't been in
yet.

274
00:25:09,163 --> 00:25:16,504
LIAM: I just put up a hand, and then slip around
this direction and slip down this second hallway

275
00:25:16,504 --> 00:25:17,987
that you revealed.

276
00:25:17,987 --> 00:25:23,551
MATT: All right. As you step past, you do see,
this room here is a little ajar; the inside looks

277
00:25:23,551 --> 00:25:27,612
to be a storage room. There's just a series of
boxes, barrels, and various--

278
00:25:27,612 --> 00:25:30,730
LAURA: (gasps) Maybe you can put yourself in a box
and walk around.

279
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:33,645
MARISHA: (gasps) Yes! Metal Gear Solid it!

280
00:25:33,645 --> 00:25:37,996
LIAM: I continue to creep away from my sister,
specifically.

281
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:44,184
MATT: All right, you glare down the side of this
hallway. It leads to two other smaller rooms down

282
00:25:44,184 --> 00:25:48,768
the way, with a split towards the back end. There
does not appear to be anybody

283
00:25:48,768 --> 00:25:50,413
visible in that hall.

284
00:25:50,413 --> 00:25:51,915
LIAM: All right, I got this, I'm going to keep
going.

285
00:25:51,915 --> 00:25:53,165
SAM: Wait, what about us!?

286
00:25:53,165 --> 00:25:54,573
LAURA: Why are you doing this?

287
00:25:54,573 --> 00:25:58,005
MATT: All right, so you go past this way.

288
00:25:58,005 --> 00:26:07,438
SAM: Jesus. Two duergar, we can take them out in a
second!

289
00:26:07,438 --> 00:26:10,476
MATT: Now this hallway, there appears to be an
opening to this room, no doorway.

290
00:26:10,476 --> 00:26:12,825
LAURA: Everybody wait while my brother goes on a
field trip.

291
00:26:12,825 --> 00:26:15,249
MATT: And this additional room, you do not
currently see an entrance.

292
00:26:15,249 --> 00:26:16,818
LIAM: An opening that's not a doorway? Or--

293
00:26:16,818 --> 00:26:18,760
MATT: I mean, there isn't a door in the way, it's
just an opening.

294
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:23,038
LIAM: The door is open. All right, so I'm going to
press against the wall, up to the edge, wait for

295
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:27,853
five seconds, see if I can hear anything, and then
if not, curve around and peek in.

296
00:26:28,009 --> 00:26:31,407
MATT: Perception roll.

297
00:26:31,407 --> 00:26:35,096
LIAM: 20.

298
00:26:35,096 --> 00:26:41,953
MATT: 20. You take a moment and listen. You hear
what sounds like a light crackling of some sort of

299
00:26:41,953 --> 00:26:50,095
a fire? And the occasional dull ring of metal
being hit against metal.

300
00:26:50,095 --> 00:26:53,785
SAM: What was it? Metal against metal?

301
00:26:53,785 --> 00:27:00,548
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to get low to the ground,
and peek in the door.

302
00:27:00,548 --> 00:27:09,702
MATT: All right. Peeking through, you do see,
indeed, it is some sort of a smithy, with two

303
00:27:09,702 --> 00:27:15,265
kilns, or two anvils, set up, a work table in the
center, and there is one lone duergar that,

304
00:27:15,265 --> 00:27:19,619
apparently, in the middle of his work, has not
been paying attention to any of the ruckus going

305
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:24,162
on around, and is just in the middle of hitting
some sort of long, thick piece of black iron, and

306
00:27:24,162 --> 00:27:28,503
it's just, (ting ting), sweat dripping down the
front of his brow, the room itself is-- even

307
00:27:28,503 --> 00:27:32,309
against the corner of the doorway, you can tell
the temperature is a lot warmer on the inside.

308
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:33,988
LIAM: And his back is to me, currently?

309
00:27:33,988 --> 00:27:37,908
MATT: It's kinda to the side to you. He's
currently looking-- working out

310
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:39,357
the anvil, banging down.

311
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:40,345
LIAM: So this way?

312
00:27:40,345 --> 00:27:41,223
MATT: Yes.

313
00:27:41,223 --> 00:27:46,222
LIAM: Oh, but I see the door on the other side, so
I take the earring--

314
00:27:46,222 --> 00:27:48,045
SAM: Oh, why don't you just keep going forever?

315
00:27:48,045 --> 00:27:51,512
LIAM: -- take the earring and I whisper to my
sister, (whispers) follow along.

316
00:27:51,512 --> 00:27:54,820
LAURA: Oh. I've been invited on the field trip,
guys!

317
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,688
SAM: Just you?

318
00:27:55,688 --> 00:27:56,725
LAURA: Just me!

319
00:27:56,725 --> 00:27:57,779
SAM: Come on!

320
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:59,055
LAURA: Who else can stealth?

321
00:27:59,055 --> 00:28:01,467
MARISHA: I'm a stealthy panther right now.

322
00:28:01,467 --> 00:28:08,848
LAURA: Do you wanna be something and pop in my
pocket? (laughs) That sounded wrong.

323
00:28:08,848 --> 00:28:11,138
MATT: You haven't had a short rest yet, and you
do--

324
00:28:11,138 --> 00:28:14,856
MARISHA: (clears throat) I was gonna say, I'm
still a cat form. But I can accompany you.

325
00:28:14,856 --> 00:28:18,676
LAURA: I should not go with you, I can't stealth
for shit right now.

326
00:28:18,676 --> 00:28:20,569
(laughter)

327
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:22,641
LAURA: I rolled a seven.

328
00:28:22,641 --> 00:28:25,589
LIAM: (whispers) Send Scanlan up.

329
00:28:25,589 --> 00:28:26,960
LAURA: (whispers) Scanlan.

330
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,012
SAM: Huh, what?

331
00:28:28,012 --> 00:28:29,507
LAURA: My brother's calling for you.

332
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:33,334
MATT: You feel the oppressive force of Clarota's
voice in your heads simultaneously say,

333
00:28:33,334 --> 00:28:36,187
"I can also accompany."

334
00:28:36,187 --> 00:28:39,247
ASHLEY: Good plan. Good plan, Clarota.

335
00:28:39,247 --> 00:28:44,683
SAM: All right. I'll step ahead and go invisible.

336
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:50,171
MATT: All right, so mark off your next
Invisibility spell. As you vanish, Clarota also

337
00:28:50,171 --> 00:28:55,004
kind of waves his hand for a moment, and his image
disappears the same way Scanlan's did.

338
00:28:55,004 --> 00:28:56,572
SAM: Ooh! He does that too?

339
00:28:56,572 --> 00:28:57,795
MATT: Apparently.

340
00:28:57,795 --> 00:28:58,771
LAURA: What did he do?

341
00:28:58,771 --> 00:29:08,794
SAM: He went invisible! (sings) We're walking down
a hall, nobody's watching us.

342
00:29:08,794 --> 00:29:10,443
(laughter)

343
00:29:10,443 --> 00:29:12,085
MATT: As you're humming to yourself--

344
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:13,673
SAM: Oh no!

345
00:29:13,673 --> 00:29:19,952
MATT: You make your way down and eventually
towards the back of where

346
00:29:19,952 --> 00:29:22,567
Vax is pressed against the--

347
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:25,246
LIAM: I can feel Scanlan's flute pressing into my
buttocks.

348
00:29:25,246 --> 00:29:26,860
SAM: That's not my flute!

349
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,571
(laughter)

350
00:29:28,571 --> 00:29:33,687
LIAM: So I turn to them, and then I start-- I pass
the door.

351
00:29:33,687 --> 00:29:35,073
MATT: Okay.

352
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,663
LIAM: I'm gonna go around the corner to that other
door.

353
00:29:37,663 --> 00:29:38,816
MATT: All right.

354
00:29:38,816 --> 00:29:41,681
LIAM: And now I'm going to stab the duergar in the
neck.

355
00:29:41,681 --> 00:29:45,808
MATT: All right! Go ahead and roll for an attack!

356
00:29:45,808 --> 00:29:47,330
LIAM: Natural 20, natural 20!

357
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,757
(cheering)

358
00:29:48,757 --> 00:29:50,156
MATT: That's how you start the game.

359
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:55,184
MARISHA: It's a good day! I feel like it's gonna
be a good day.

360
00:29:55,184 --> 00:30:01,645
MATT: All righty. So go ahead and roll damage.
This is a sneak attack, as he didn't-- it was not

361
00:30:01,645 --> 00:30:02,907
aware you were there.

362
00:30:02,907 --> 00:30:08,891
LIAM: I'll use my keen dagger, I think. Four plus
seven is-- This is a pencil, right? Okay, 11.

363
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:11,064
Where-- how do you make it work? 11.

364
00:30:11,064 --> 00:30:12,163
MATT: All right.

365
00:30:12,163 --> 00:30:15,977
LIAM: Eight, 13--

366
00:30:15,977 --> 00:30:18,260
SAM: Get him in the neck so he can't yell.

367
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,907
LIAM: Ooh. 66.

368
00:30:21,907 --> 00:30:25,696
MATT: You don't multiply the modifier. The
modifier goes on at the end. So it's the dice roll

369
00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:30,982
plus your sneak attack, multiplied by two, and
then the dex modifier at the end.

370
00:30:30,982 --> 00:30:34,281
MARISHA: That's a lot!

371
00:30:34,281 --> 00:30:35,405
LIAM: Okay.

372
00:30:35,405 --> 00:30:36,727
MATT: Plus seven, I think, right at the end.

373
00:30:36,727 --> 00:30:37,940
LIAM: Yeah, that's right.

374
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,834
So it's the damage plus the sneak attack,
double that--

375
00:30:40,877 --> 00:30:42,501
MATT: And then add the plus seven at the end.

376
00:30:42,501 --> 00:30:45,499
LAURA: That's 28 times two plus seven.

377
00:30:45,499 --> 00:30:46,715
LIAM: 26.

378
00:30:46,715 --> 00:30:50,656
MATT: Splitting hairs here! That's enough. So.

379
00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:52,126
LIAM: One plus two plus two plus one.

380
00:30:52,126 --> 00:30:59,122
MATT: So you hear this, 'Tink! Tink! Tink!'
(pause) That's it. Without even a guttural noise,

381
00:30:59,122 --> 00:31:03,119
the dagger buries itself in the base of his skull.
You see him just (grunts)

382
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:04,788
and slump down to the ground.

383
00:31:04,788 --> 00:31:11,263
LIAM: I catch the hammer and I start going 'Tink!
Tink! Tink!' And wave the two invisible beings

384
00:31:11,263 --> 00:31:12,390
into the room.

385
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,737
ASHLEY: Hey! What happened in there?

386
00:31:13,737 --> 00:31:16,944
SAM: We're here! We're ready to fight. What do you
need us to do?

387
00:31:16,944 --> 00:31:23,700
MATT: Kima at this point-- You can see her hand
kind of tensing around the sword as she looks back

388
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:32,547
at Grog, whose hands are also wringing his
greataxe. "I want to kill something!" She kind of

389
00:31:32,547 --> 00:31:35,314
backs off to the side and sees the other duergar
that are there.

390
00:31:35,314 --> 00:31:36,777
ASHLEY: (Grog voice) I want to rage!

391
00:31:36,777 --> 00:31:39,303
MATT: And she's going to go ahead and run around.

392
00:31:39,303 --> 00:31:42,518
LIAM: Don't waste my natural 20, Kima. Come on!

393
00:31:42,518 --> 00:31:44,764
LAURA: Man, you can't control Kima!

394
00:31:44,764 --> 00:31:48,963
MARISHA: This is why we don't have AI in the
party, guys. You can't control the AI.

395
00:31:48,963 --> 00:31:56,320
MATT: You know you guys are telling a very, very
angry woman right now to be patient. Doesn't seem

396
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,664
to make a ruckus.

397
00:31:57,664 --> 00:32:03,292
LAURA: Can I sneak up to the corner at least, so I
can be ready to attack those two bastards?

398
00:32:03,292 --> 00:32:06,620
MATT: Over to here? All righty. Trinket, who
hasn't seen you in a while,

399
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,122
is sticking to your back.

400
00:32:08,122 --> 00:32:10,390
LAURA: I sit there and I kind of pet him as I look
around the corner.

401
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:15,307
MATT: Okay. Trinket is enjoying the petting. All
right, so that duergar's down, the current armory

402
00:32:15,307 --> 00:32:21,160
section appears to be completely open and at your
disposal. There are a series of partially made

403
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:28,199
weapons kind of scattered in a pile. There are
some ingots, and even some raw iron material in

404
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:32,660
the far corner. Other than that, it just looks
like your general smithing workshop.

405
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,705
SAM: Is Kima with us now?

406
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:38,378
MATT: Kima is currently looking around this
section with you guys.

407
00:32:38,378 --> 00:32:43,028
SAM: Kima, do you see any of your equipment here
that you wanted?

408
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:48,525
MATT: She glances around, goes and move some of the
piles by, turning over the room as quietly as she

409
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:53,688
can-- not as quietly as you'd like-- but quiet
enough. "No. Nothing's here."

410
00:32:53,688 --> 00:32:57,731
SAM: Can't you just take one of these things and
call it a day?

411
00:32:57,731 --> 00:33:00,279
(laughter)

412
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:02,672
MATT: She glares in the direction of your voice.

413
00:33:02,672 --> 00:33:03,854
SAM: I'm invisible, I--

414
00:33:03,854 --> 00:33:07,302
MATT: "This will do me just fine for now!"

415
00:33:07,302 --> 00:33:08,443
SAM: Oh!

416
00:33:08,443 --> 00:33:16,203
MATT: "Right. Let's keep looking." She leaves the
room. She starts heading down this way--

417
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:18,704
LIAM: All right, I'm following after her,
tiptoeing after her.

418
00:33:18,704 --> 00:33:23,116
LAURA: We should go after her. 'Cause we're all
gonna split up.

419
00:33:23,116 --> 00:33:26,256
LIAM: Yeah, I speak into my earring and say zubba
zubba zubba zubba.

420
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:30,380
LAURA: Let's all go in that back way and see if we
can stealth around.

421
00:33:30,422 --> 00:33:32,990
MATT: Okay. For everyone else, stealth
check.

422
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,050
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

423
00:33:34,092 --> 00:33:35,285
ASHLEY: Here we go!

424
00:33:35,285 --> 00:33:37,362
ORION: Yes! Natural 20!

425
00:33:37,362 --> 00:33:40,307
MATT: Disadvantage on you, Pike, because of your
heavy armor.

426
00:33:40,307 --> 00:33:42,010
ASHLEY: So that means I roll twice?

427
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,171
MATT: Roll twice, take the lower.

428
00:33:43,171 --> 00:33:44,407
ASHLEY: I take the lower one.

429
00:33:44,407 --> 00:33:51,488
ORION: Now as that happens, I want to cast Mage
Hand and I want to cast Light on it, and I want to

430
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,755
slowly have it drift down there.

431
00:33:53,755 --> 00:33:56,895
MATT: They're both concentration spells. You can
have one or the other.

432
00:33:56,895 --> 00:33:58,430
ORION: Dagnabbit.

433
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,731
MATT: Mage Hand isn't an actual object,
unfortunately.

434
00:34:00,731 --> 00:34:10,599
ORION: Dagnabbit. Okay, fine. Instead I cast
Prestidigitation and I make a little glowy orb,

435
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:15,465
and it's a little flickery, and I cast-- I think I
can maybe try, what, 15 feet?

436
00:34:15,465 --> 00:34:18,017
MATT: Okay. And where are you casting it? Just in
the middle of this hallway here?

437
00:34:18,017 --> 00:34:19,466
ORION: No. To my left.

438
00:34:19,466 --> 00:34:20,442
MATT: Here?

439
00:34:20,442 --> 00:34:21,754
SAM: He wants to see in the dark place.

440
00:34:21,754 --> 00:34:23,001
ORION: I wanna see in the dark place.

441
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:29,064
MATT: There is no entrance to this room
currently from what you can see. It's just a wall.

442
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,717
There is a door on the opposite side.

443
00:34:31,717 --> 00:34:33,724
SAM: Now it's a well-lit wall.

444
00:34:33,724 --> 00:34:37,339
ORION: Hm. All right, well, I follow after the
bear.

445
00:34:37,339 --> 00:34:38,661
(laughter)

446
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:41,463
MATT: All right, so what was your stealth roll?

447
00:34:41,463 --> 00:34:42,516
LAURA: Oh, it was 17.

448
00:34:42,516 --> 00:34:44,847
MATT: 17. Roll for Trinket.

449
00:34:44,847 --> 00:34:46,047
LAURA: Oh gosh.

450
00:34:46,047 --> 00:34:47,476
SAM: (bear noises)

451
00:34:47,533 --> 00:34:49,677
LAURA: I thought he just got what I got. Crap.

452
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,998
SAM: Not good.

453
00:34:51,998 --> 00:34:53,498
LAURA: What do I add to it?

454
00:34:53,498 --> 00:34:54,464
SAM: Nothing.

455
00:34:54,464 --> 00:34:55,952
MATT: Add his dex modifier. Trinket's dex
modifier.

456
00:34:55,952 --> 00:34:59,905
LAURA: Okay, hold on. Hold on. Oh, good.

457
00:34:59,905 --> 00:35:01,392
LIAM and LAURA: 11.

458
00:35:01,392 --> 00:35:08,886
MATT: All right, as you guys are making your way
down the hallway, slowly--

459
00:35:08,886 --> 00:35:12,411
LAURA: I kinda clamp my hand over his mouth and
tell him to shush.

460
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:17,266
MATT: You guys make your way down here. One of the
duergar glances over--

461
00:35:17,266 --> 00:35:18,575
SAM: Oh boy.

462
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,953
MATT: -- utters something to the friend at his
side and he goes--

463
00:35:21,034 --> 00:35:23,804
LIAM: I heard the bear and I start sliding my back
down along the wall.

464
00:35:23,804 --> 00:35:27,316
LAURA: Oh crap. I turn around and notch my arrow
for them.

465
00:35:27,316 --> 00:35:30,007
MATT: Okay, Trinket moves past

466
00:35:30,007 --> 00:35:33,005
TALIESIN: I walk up to the very, very edge of the
hallway.

467
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:38,935
LIAM: And I'm stabbing! Stabbing, stabbing!
Stabbing.

468
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:42,173
ORION: Matthew, behind the bear.

469
00:35:42,218 --> 00:35:44,071
MATT: You move behind the bear?

470
00:35:44,071 --> 00:35:45,024
ORION: Yes.

471
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,975
MATT: You are right there and they both see you

472
00:35:46,975 --> 00:35:49,657
ORION: No, no, the other bear. I mean, the other
side of the bear.

473
00:35:49,657 --> 00:35:58,277
MATT: As you're walking behind Trinket, all this
transpires simultaneously. Right. And they saw the

474
00:35:58,438 --> 00:36:02,719
bear and then saw something move behind it. Their
attention was got. They see you and they start

475
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:03,657
walking towards--

476
00:36:03,657 --> 00:36:05,008
LIAM: Stabbing duergars, stabbing duergars.

477
00:36:05,008 --> 00:36:08,269
MATT: However, as they pass there, you get one shot
at this guy as he passes past you. Go ahead and

478
00:36:08,314 --> 00:36:09,310
make your attack.

479
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,432
ORION: I wave at them.

480
00:36:10,432 --> 00:36:12,436
MATT: Okay. (laughs) Tiberius waves at them.

481
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,120
MARISHA: I go ahead and move up next to Percy.

482
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,670
ORION: Hello. I don't think they're our friends.

483
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:20,185
MATT: Unfortunately, the space is a little limited
for your size. You have to wait for the rest of

484
00:36:20,185 --> 00:36:21,421
them to let you by.

485
00:36:21,421 --> 00:36:27,409
MARISHA: Oh, but Grog's behind me. He's not here,
right? Where's Grog?

486
00:36:27,409 --> 00:36:29,735
MATT: You're a big cat right now.

487
00:36:29,735 --> 00:36:30,911
MARISHA: I'm a big kitty.

488
00:36:30,911 --> 00:36:32,143
LIAM: I rolled a 15.

489
00:36:32,143 --> 00:36:35,168
MATT: 15? 15 does barely hit.

490
00:36:35,168 --> 00:36:40,956
LIAM: Okay, so same keen dagger.

491
00:36:40,956 --> 00:36:44,067
MATT: As you go ahead, move around the corner and
fire. Two arrows?

492
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:45,225
LAURA: 17.

493
00:36:45,225 --> 00:36:48,838
MATT: All right. Second one? Same guy or different
targets?

494
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:54,446
LAURA: Same target. He's right in front. That one
hits too, that's 19.

495
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:57,219
MATT: Both hit, go ahead and roll damage on both.

496
00:36:57,219 --> 00:36:58,491
LIAM: 32 for me.

497
00:36:58,491 --> 00:37:06,319
MATT: Okay. So as you watch them both walk past
you, one of them continues past with his hammer

498
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:09,830
out, rushing towards whatever he sees moving at
the end of the hallway, probably Tiberius after

499
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:14,358
Trinket. The next one that comes past you, you
reach around and just take your dagger and swing

500
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:19,089
it across the back of his neck area. You manage to
sever the base of the spine and he just crumples

501
00:37:19,089 --> 00:37:22,857
into a pile in front of you. The other one--
Damage?

502
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:25,868
LAURA: 22 with the two arrows. Nine and 13.

503
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:31,887
MATT: Both arrows impact his chest. The duergar
steps back for a second, surprised by the moment,

504
00:37:31,887 --> 00:37:36,376
looks really furious and begins to step forward,
his size enlarging.

505
00:37:36,376 --> 00:37:39,672
TALIESIN: I knock him right in the face with the
butt of my gun as he rounds the corner.

506
00:37:39,672 --> 00:37:44,827
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a stealth check
to see whether or not he sees you.

507
00:37:44,827 --> 00:37:46,688
TALIESIN: I can't use my previous stealth roll?

508
00:37:46,688 --> 00:37:49,673
MATT: Not for this point. This is an active
combat.

509
00:37:49,673 --> 00:37:51,869
TALIESIN: Damn it. Eight.

510
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:56,845
MATT: Okay. So you still get the attack, but you
don't have advantage, 'cause he's aware you're

511
00:37:56,904 --> 00:38:00,519
there. As he's running past you, he glances and
sees you in the corner of his eye and is preparing

512
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:02,868
for the blows. Go ahead and roll your attack.

513
00:38:02,868 --> 00:38:05,535
TALIESIN: What do I add to this, by the way? I've
never done a physical attack.

514
00:38:05,535 --> 00:38:10,440
MATT: You're hitting it with the blunt. Go ahead
and roll a d20 and

515
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,160
add your strength modifier and four.

516
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,164
TALIESIN: All right. Natural 20!

517
00:38:17,164 --> 00:38:18,934
(cheering)

518
00:38:18,934 --> 00:38:20,288
MARISHA: Look, it's flashing!

519
00:38:20,288 --> 00:38:22,557
TALIESIN: It flashes if I hit a natural 20.

520
00:38:22,557 --> 00:38:28,902
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll damage. It
is a 1d4 plus your strength modifier.

521
00:38:28,902 --> 00:38:33,209
TALIESIN: So that would be 2d4 plus my strength
modifier, because it's a natural 20.

522
00:38:33,209 --> 00:38:34,796
MATT: Correct, yes.

523
00:38:34,796 --> 00:38:38,801
TALIESIN: That's six points of damage.

524
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:41,038
MATT: Well, it's five on there, right?

525
00:38:41,038 --> 00:38:42,874
TALIESIN: My strength modifier is one.

526
00:38:42,874 --> 00:38:45,806
MATT: Okay, so that's five times two is ten plus
one. 11 points of damage.

527
00:38:45,806 --> 00:38:47,105
TALIESIN: 11 points of damage.

528
00:38:47,105 --> 00:38:50,951
MATT: Which will do it. As the duergar sees you,
is rushing past with his hammer, about to fall

529
00:38:51,138 --> 00:38:57,057
back and swing at you, you rush out from behind
the corner with the blunt end of your weapon and

530
00:38:57,057 --> 00:38:59,817
just whack him in the side of the temple.

531
00:38:59,817 --> 00:39:01,233
SAM: Girly scream.

532
00:39:01,233 --> 00:39:03,345
ORION: What was that?

533
00:39:03,345 --> 00:39:05,115
TALIESIN: (whispers) We're good, we're good.

534
00:39:05,115 --> 00:39:08,057
MATT: Unconscious on the ground. Alive but
unconscious.

535
00:39:08,057 --> 00:39:11,420
ASHLEY: He's not dead? Can I-- so he's at a
disadvantage, basically?

536
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,061
MATT: He's incapacitated.

537
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:16,115
ASHLEY: So can I go up to him and slit his throat
with my mace of disruption?

538
00:39:16,115 --> 00:39:18,258
To make sure he's dead?

539
00:39:18,258 --> 00:39:19,222
MATT: If you'd like to?

540
00:39:19,252 --> 00:39:20,207
ASHLEY: Yes, I want to.

541
00:39:20,207 --> 00:39:21,397
MATT: Okay.

542
00:39:21,397 --> 00:39:23,245
ASHLEY: Is that really bad, though?

543
00:39:23,245 --> 00:39:26,783
MATT: Pike walks up and grabs the back of the
duergar's hair, holds it back and using the jagged

544
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:32,258
edge of her mace of disruption, tears open the
throat of the duergar, which then spills all this

545
00:39:32,258 --> 00:39:33,924
blackish ichor across the ground.

546
00:39:33,995 --> 00:39:36,267
LIAM: She went renegade, folks. She's gone
renegade.

547
00:39:36,267 --> 00:39:38,714
ASHLEY: I just wanted to make sure he didn't come
after us.

548
00:39:38,714 --> 00:39:46,379
MATT: Grog looks impressed but also slightly
worried as the man who grew up alongside you. All

549
00:39:46,379 --> 00:39:48,851
right, so that happened.

550
00:39:48,851 --> 00:39:54,831
LIAM: And then she says, okay, I'm gonna dismember
the body. Hold on.

551
00:39:54,831 --> 00:39:56,667
(laughter)

552
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:58,030
LAURA: Torture weapons.

553
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:03,474
SAM: Because I'm invisible in the thing with Lady
Kima, I get up on a stool to see if I can catch

554
00:40:03,474 --> 00:40:04,911
some cleavage.

555
00:40:04,911 --> 00:40:06,311
(laughter)

556
00:40:06,311 --> 00:40:08,440
SAM: Just peek over, peek in.

557
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:14,897
MATT: The leather armor that she wore is a full
torso-covering leather armor piece, I apologize.

558
00:40:14,897 --> 00:40:16,781
SAM: (sighs) I give up.

559
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:27,869
MATT: Sorry, Scanlan. She is-- Yeah, which by the
way, I mean, it's not just so much the fact that

560
00:40:27,869 --> 00:40:33,224
Pike did it, it's the fact that Pike did it by
running a jagged, blade-edged mace across

561
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:35,620
someone's throat. It was less of a slice and more of
a--

562
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,433
ASHLEY: Is Sarenrae gonna get really mad at me?

563
00:40:37,538 --> 00:40:38,406
MATT: We'll see.

564
00:40:38,406 --> 00:40:42,070
ASHLEY: They're really bad! If they're really bad
guys, they were super bad. The duergar are so bad.

565
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,385
She'd probably be happy--

566
00:40:43,385 --> 00:40:45,468
ORION: Right, Pike, but man, that was rough.

567
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:46,533
MATT: We'll find out.

568
00:40:46,533 --> 00:40:48,598
TALIESIN: He had a little duergar back at home.

569
00:40:48,598 --> 00:40:53,040
MATT: So, given this case, now the rest of the
party is able to move forward. This hallway now,

570
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,423
you can only see about that far down with the
current light source. You can see Kima is now

571
00:40:58,423 --> 00:40:59,491
moving across--

572
00:40:59,491 --> 00:41:00,625
SAM: Aw, she's just going?

573
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,280
LAURA: Go listen-- aw, she's still going that
direction?

574
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,082
LIAM: All right. I'm tiptoe-jogging behind Kima.

575
00:41:04,082 --> 00:41:07,834
MARISHA: Can we do something to slow her down?

576
00:41:07,834 --> 00:41:09,533
SAM: I can stop her if you want?

577
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,529
MARISHA: Well, I mean, can we-- I mean, we don't
wanna stop her

578
00:41:11,529 --> 00:41:13,781
I just wanna be like, hey, slow, girl.

579
00:41:13,781 --> 00:41:16,285
LAURA: She's-- you know what? I bet she's pretty
noisy too!

580
00:41:16,285 --> 00:41:18,986
MATT: She's wearing leather armor, she's not very
noisy right now.

581
00:41:18,986 --> 00:41:24,672
LIAM: I carefully place a hand on Kima's shoulder,
and do a little, sort of, curtsy motion.

582
00:41:24,672 --> 00:41:26,783
Allow me, I can--

583
00:41:26,783 --> 00:41:31,537
MATT: Okay, as you do so she kinda stops and looks
back over her shoulder and gives a begrudging nod.

584
00:41:31,537 --> 00:41:35,836
But you can see she's-- there's shaking, her hand
holding the greatsword

585
00:41:35,836 --> 00:41:37,389
is currently shaking with rage.

586
00:41:37,389 --> 00:41:42,314
LIAM: I say-- (silent) Two words, three
syllables.

587
00:41:42,314 --> 00:41:43,812
(laughter)

588
00:41:43,812 --> 00:41:51,048
MATT: All right, so. Coasting down this hallway.
It leads down to an open doorway and a closed

589
00:41:51,048 --> 00:41:57,187
doorway immediately to your right. And then the
room to-- actually, the doorway's to your left,

590
00:41:57,187 --> 00:42:00,327
and to the right you see another wall to another
room that you don't have

591
00:42:00,327 --> 00:42:01,734
a doorway currently available.

592
00:42:01,734 --> 00:42:03,333
LIAM: There's a door to my left and a door
straight ahead, right?

593
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:04,451
MATT: Correct.

594
00:42:04,451 --> 00:42:09,792
LIAM: Okay, I inch up to the closed door on the
left and place my ear to the door and listen.

595
00:42:09,792 --> 00:42:13,471
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a perception check.

596
00:42:13,471 --> 00:42:14,958
LIAM: Yeah, natural 20.

597
00:42:14,958 --> 00:42:16,186
MARISHA: What?!

598
00:42:16,186 --> 00:42:17,604
ASHLEY: Come on!

599
00:42:17,604 --> 00:42:19,112
SAM: Yeah. It's gonna be one of those nights.

600
00:42:19,112 --> 00:42:20,628
LAURA: I need that one! Oh my goodness.

601
00:42:20,628 --> 00:42:22,017
TALIESIN: Don't. Jinx it.

602
00:42:22,017 --> 00:42:25,667
MATT: I'm gon' kill all you.

603
00:42:25,667 --> 00:42:27,158
LAURA: No!

604
00:42:27,158 --> 00:42:28,672
(laughter)

605
00:42:28,672 --> 00:42:35,941
MATT: You put your ear to the side, and you hear
nothing.

606
00:42:35,941 --> 00:42:41,955
LIAM: Okay. Do I sense any kind of-- I'm checking
for traps on the door.

607
00:42:41,955 --> 00:42:44,179
MATT: Okay. Yup.

608
00:42:44,179 --> 00:42:49,460
LIAM: Trap's perception, right? 26.

609
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:55,769
MATT: So the door itself does not appear to be
trapped. It does appear to be locked, though.

610
00:42:55,769 --> 00:43:02,113
LIAM: All right, well, I pull out my picks. And I
get a three on that, so--

611
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:04,432
MATT: That's okay. It's a really, really, really
crappy lock.

612
00:43:04,432 --> 00:43:05,459
LAURA: Oh!

613
00:43:05,459 --> 00:43:10,354
MATT: You notice that the door itself, it has a
locking mechanism on it. It was kinda half-locked,

614
00:43:10,416 --> 00:43:14,356
and as you push, it opens up, into a commode.

615
00:43:14,356 --> 00:43:16,289
LIAM: Aw, yes!

616
00:43:16,289 --> 00:43:22,594
MATT: There's nobody in there. It is a room with
what looks almost like a bench, with a series of

617
00:43:22,594 --> 00:43:24,621
holes cut into the bench. It's a communal--

618
00:43:24,621 --> 00:43:28,116
LIAM: Well, I'm tempted to close the door for a
moment, but I will press on instead.

619
00:43:28,116 --> 00:43:30,135
SAM: Check for loot!

620
00:43:30,135 --> 00:43:31,438
(laughter)

621
00:43:31,438 --> 00:43:32,973
LAURA: Gross!

622
00:43:32,973 --> 00:43:38,132
LIAM: All right, so I'm going to inch towards that
open door ahead of me, see what's around the

623
00:43:38,132 --> 00:43:39,115
corner.

624
00:43:39,115 --> 00:43:42,796
SAM: I'm gonna follow-- I'm gonna inch up behind
him as well. I'm still invisible, right? How long

625
00:43:42,796 --> 00:43:43,888
does that last?

626
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:46,276
MATT: Okay. It's concentration for quite some
time, I believe.

627
00:43:46,276 --> 00:43:47,471
MARISHA: Actually--

628
00:43:47,471 --> 00:43:50,108
TALIESIN: Really quickly-- Oh, do you want to go
first?

629
00:43:50,108 --> 00:43:51,274
MARISHA: No, you go.

630
00:43:51,274 --> 00:43:54,240
TALIESIN: Does anyone want to hide these bodies
that we've just scattered about--

631
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,573
LAURA: Yeah, that would be good!

632
00:43:55,573 --> 00:43:57,278
MARISHA: Inside the loo.

633
00:43:57,278 --> 00:43:59,099
TALIESIN: It's a perfect place for them to be
interred.

634
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:02,664
LIAM: So, Pike, hold still, please.

635
00:44:02,664 --> 00:44:04,076
ASHLEY: I'm not moving!

636
00:44:04,076 --> 00:44:05,894
SAM: Pike, eviscerate the bodies!

637
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:12,120
MARISHA: Here, I'm gonna-- I'll walk over, in
tiger form, and I just grab one by the scruff and

638
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,111
start dragging it.

639
00:44:14,111 --> 00:44:18,812
MATT: Grog helps out. You guys move the two bodies
slowly over into the restroom area.

640
00:44:18,812 --> 00:44:23,235
MARISHA: Wait, we kinda prop them up to kinda like
Weekend at Bernie's them, yeah, make them just

641
00:44:23,235 --> 00:44:25,295
look like they're, you know, passed out.

642
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:30,799
MATT: Okay, as they're both generally laying back,
like they just got really drunk and barely found

643
00:44:30,799 --> 00:44:31,866
their way to the toilet.

644
00:44:31,866 --> 00:44:33,069
SAM: And throats slit.

645
00:44:33,069 --> 00:44:34,471
(laughter)

646
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:36,416
MATT: It's really rough blockage.

647
00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:40,614
MARISHA: We take that one and kind of like lean him
forward so you can't tell immediately.

648
00:44:40,614 --> 00:44:44,020
MATT: Okay. All right, that's not a worry. You
bring that up to that little area there.

649
00:44:44,094 --> 00:44:45,199
All right.

650
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:47,035
LIAM: Well done, there.

651
00:44:47,035 --> 00:44:48,801
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you.

652
00:44:48,801 --> 00:44:52,463
MATT: You guys move forward to that. Grog has come
over here to be able to help. Now, looking down

653
00:44:52,463 --> 00:44:54,236
this hallway, here you can see--

654
00:44:54,236 --> 00:44:58,222
SAM: Who we got, who we got?

655
00:44:58,222 --> 00:45:00,970
MATT: This side opens up--

656
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:03,807
LAURA: All I want to do is find the damn treasure
room.

657
00:45:03,807 --> 00:45:11,577
MATT: Looking into this room, it appears to be a
barracks. A room that is just filled with

658
00:45:11,577 --> 00:45:13,620
different beds, all apparently empty.

659
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,949
LAURA: Oh, they're up and looking for us.

660
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:17,648
MARISHA: <i>Apparently</i> empty?

661
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,171
MATT: From what you can see.

662
00:45:19,171 --> 00:45:26,323
MARISHA: Can I use my keen smell to see if I smell
any duergar in there?

663
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:32,706
MATT: Sure. So you slowly approach the door using
your keen senses, which opens up this

664
00:45:32,706 --> 00:45:40,576
hallway a little bit visibly to you. You can see
it goes back quite a bit. Sniffing this room, you

665
00:45:40,576 --> 00:45:45,225
can tell that there were duergar there recently.
Apparently, at the moment, though, there is no

666
00:45:45,225 --> 00:45:51,687
immediate scent that matches a duergar. So the
room, for the most part, has been completely

667
00:45:51,687 --> 00:45:52,799
evacuated.

668
00:45:52,799 --> 00:45:58,689
MARISHA: Okay, I kinda-- even though I'm not a
dog, I'm a cat, I still kinda point. I go into

669
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:02,322
pointer face. You know? Like--

670
00:46:02,322 --> 00:46:03,618
ORION: Pointer face?

671
00:46:03,618 --> 00:46:05,234
MARISHA: You know, like a pointer.

672
00:46:05,234 --> 00:46:06,932
LIAM: Yeah, angling your nose forward, all right.

673
00:46:06,932 --> 00:46:08,476
SAM: I think Keyleth has to pee.

674
00:46:08,476 --> 00:46:10,880
(laughter)

675
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,735
SAM: I never had a cat.

676
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:17,200
LIAM: All right, I'm gonna start sliding down that
hall there, ignoring this other passage, and get

677
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,479
up to the door and again place my ear to it. Oh
look, there's the front entrance.

678
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:26,743
MATT: As you look to your right, this is a large
foyer-type area with two red carpets that are

679
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:31,345
rolled on the sides of it that lead to the front
of the main double-sided, large ten-foot-tall

680
00:46:31,345 --> 00:46:38,628
stone doors of the front of the fortress. To your
left, there is a double wooden door, about eight

681
00:46:38,628 --> 00:46:42,787
feet tall each side, about five feet wide, that
are currently closed, leading into whatever this

682
00:46:42,787 --> 00:46:44,986
large chamber is immediately to your left.

683
00:46:44,986 --> 00:46:47,563
SAM: Can I hang a right and go down that other
hall?

684
00:46:47,563 --> 00:46:49,283
TALIESIN: We should check out what's in that other
hall.

685
00:46:49,283 --> 00:46:50,442
SAM: Is there a door over there?

686
00:46:50,442 --> 00:46:52,096
MATT: There are two doors, actually.

687
00:46:52,096 --> 00:46:53,082
SAM: Closed?

688
00:46:53,082 --> 00:46:53,889
MATT: Both closed.

689
00:46:53,889 --> 00:46:55,488
SAM: I'm going to listen into those doors.

690
00:46:55,488 --> 00:46:56,974
MATT: Make a perception check.

691
00:46:56,974 --> 00:46:58,603
SAM: Natural 17.

692
00:46:58,603 --> 00:47:01,070
(cheering)

693
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:03,076
MARISHA: Gotta love that nat 17.

694
00:47:03,076 --> 00:47:08,374
MATT: Listening in, you don't hear any noise.

695
00:47:08,374 --> 00:47:10,685
SAM: That could mean nothing.

696
00:47:10,685 --> 00:47:12,039
LIAM: Are you at the double doors with me?

697
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:13,765
SAM: I'm to the right. I went the other way.

698
00:47:13,765 --> 00:47:19,023
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to listen at the big
wooden doors, and I rolled, oh,

699
00:47:19,023 --> 00:47:21,467
not that great. 17.

700
00:47:21,467 --> 00:47:23,529
MATT: All right. Listening in--

701
00:47:23,529 --> 00:47:28,342
ORION: I scootch up ahead of Grog like, excuse me,
excuse me.

702
00:47:28,342 --> 00:47:37,133
MATT: As you listen back, there is no noise
internally, except for the slight squeak as you

703
00:47:37,133 --> 00:47:42,612
put yourself against the door. It shifts a little bit,
making no noticeable noise, but it appears the

704
00:47:42,612 --> 00:47:45,156
doors are unlocked, or there is no lock.

705
00:47:45,156 --> 00:47:46,791
LAURA: Oh no.

706
00:47:46,791 --> 00:47:50,040
MATT: You're not hearing anything from inside that
one door you're at.

707
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,932
SAM: Wait, I just heard a noise?

708
00:47:51,932 --> 00:47:53,368
MATT: No, you hear no noise coming from that
room.

709
00:47:53,368 --> 00:47:59,279
SAM: Oh, okay. Stinking Cloud, can I go through
doors, or do I have to see what

710
00:47:59,279 --> 00:48:00,358
I'm casting it at?

711
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:02,864
MATT: You have to have sight, unfortunately. I
mean, you could peek very low.

712
00:48:02,864 --> 00:48:05,535
SAM: I'm going to open the door and look.

713
00:48:05,535 --> 00:48:06,593
MATT: Okay.

714
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:08,095
SAM: 'Cause why not?

715
00:48:08,095 --> 00:48:14,145
MATT: You open the door. It appears to be some
sort of a guest bedroom. It's a singular bed

716
00:48:14,145 --> 00:48:20,289
that's in much better condition than the barracks,
it's empty, it's well-made. It's more lit than the

717
00:48:20,352 --> 00:48:28,393
other rooms. It seems to be a room that's designed
for either non-duergar riff-raff or general

718
00:48:28,393 --> 00:48:34,026
soldiers or guests or people that would come to
the fortress to stay, so.

719
00:48:34,026 --> 00:48:35,442
SAM: Okay.

720
00:48:35,442 --> 00:48:41,996
LIAM: I'm going to try to peer into the door, and
I haven't talked about this before, but I'm wearing

721
00:48:41,996 --> 00:48:47,608
a cloak of elvenkind, which means I have advantage
on stealth, and enemies have disadvantage on

722
00:48:47,667 --> 00:48:50,278
spotting me, so I'm going to lean my head in.

723
00:48:50,278 --> 00:48:51,529
MATT: All right.

724
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:53,215
LIAM: Do I need to roll for stealth or am I
already stealthed?

725
00:48:53,215 --> 00:48:56,963
MATT: For this, you're already stealthed. So as
you glance inside the room, you see what appears

726
00:48:56,963 --> 00:49:03,597
to be a great hall of some kind. There are large
wooden tables, there is a fire pit in the center

727
00:49:03,597 --> 00:49:08,181
that has a number of mostly burned wood that is
mainly just small darkened embers with a little

728
00:49:08,181 --> 00:49:13,990
bit of glowing yellow and red to it. There are
stools scattered about the room, you can see there

729
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:19,416
are remnants of some of a meal that hasn't been
fully cleaned up yet on some of the tables. But

730
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:26,445
the room appears to be empty. You do see a slight
glimmer across the way on one of the tables.

731
00:49:26,445 --> 00:49:28,695
LIAM: Oh, I'm going to go check it out.

732
00:49:28,695 --> 00:49:30,229
LAURA: (whispers) Get the sparkly thing.

733
00:49:30,229 --> 00:49:33,199
MATT: All right. Everyone else, what are you
doing?

734
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:37,799
SAM: Can I look around the guest bedroom? Just
kinda snoop around up in things?

735
00:49:37,799 --> 00:49:42,516
LAURA: Can I ask him, I'm asking you what you see
in there. What do you see in there?

736
00:49:42,516 --> 00:49:44,204
LIAM: I don't know yet, hold on

737
00:49:44,204 --> 00:49:45,384
LAURA: Is it sparkly?

738
00:49:45,384 --> 00:49:47,490
LIAM: I'm going to try to sense for traps in this
room.

739
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:48,483
MATT: Okay.

740
00:49:48,483 --> 00:49:50,348
MARISHA: I'm going to snoop in the barracks.

741
00:49:50,348 --> 00:49:51,860
MATT: Snoop in the barracks.

742
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,093
LIAM: 14.

743
00:49:53,093 --> 00:49:58,951
ORION: I'm going to make my way around all this
riff-raff, uh, no, uh, yes.

744
00:49:58,951 --> 00:50:03,306
MATT: You push your way through. "Excuse me,
excuse me, pardon me." Pushing through everybody.

745
00:50:03,306 --> 00:50:10,703
ORION: I'm going to go past where Vax is in the
room down that hallway, then I'm going to do my

746
00:50:10,703 --> 00:50:15,780
Mage Hand thingy again. Oh, my Prestidigitation.

747
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,995
MATT: Down this hallway?

748
00:50:16,995 --> 00:50:17,931
ORION: Mm-hm.

749
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:18,748
MATT: Okay.

750
00:50:18,748 --> 00:50:20,734
ORION: Slowly, five feet by five feet.

751
00:50:20,734 --> 00:50:27,094
MATT: All right. You see slowly, as you move down
this hallway to check it out, a secondary set of

752
00:50:27,094 --> 00:50:29,029
barracks that are also apparently empty.

753
00:50:29,029 --> 00:50:34,696
LAURA: Where are they? The stairs are up in the storage
room, man. That's where we just were.

754
00:50:34,857 --> 00:50:40,514
MATT: You see a secondary commode that is open. And
as you glance around the corner as the light

755
00:50:40,534 --> 00:50:44,616
passes by you see there are two duergar currently
coming down the hallway this direction.

756
00:50:44,616 --> 00:50:45,616
MARISHA: Oh shit!

757
00:50:45,616 --> 00:50:48,175
ORION: I just stop! And I creep back.

758
00:50:48,175 --> 00:50:54,711
MATT: Okay. As you creep back, you hear footsteps
coming your way quickly.

759
00:50:54,711 --> 00:50:59,083
LIAM: I'm going to the door, then, I can hear
that. Inside the door, inside the door.

760
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:00,481
MATT: Oh, inside the door there?

761
00:51:00,481 --> 00:51:04,075
MARISHA: I'm going to stay actually right there,
just right at the threshold.

762
00:51:04,075 --> 00:51:05,669
MATT: Okay. The rest of you guys?

763
00:51:05,669 --> 00:51:10,361
LAURA: I mean, I'm so far away. I can try to get
up there but--

764
00:51:10,361 --> 00:51:14,673
MATT: You can glance, there's still a hallway
around that way if you wanted to go around.

765
00:51:14,673 --> 00:51:16,277
LAURA: Okay. I'll go around the back way then.

766
00:51:16,277 --> 00:51:17,323
MATT: Okay, so you move around--

767
00:51:17,323 --> 00:51:18,518
LAURA: With Trinket!

768
00:51:18,518 --> 00:51:22,825
MATT: Trinket follows up behind. Makes your way up
there. Scanlan, you staying in that room?

769
00:51:22,825 --> 00:51:25,367
SAM: I'm taking a dump on the guest bed.

770
00:51:25,367 --> 00:51:28,974
(laughter)

771
00:51:28,974 --> 00:51:30,577
ORION: They don't see me, right?

772
00:51:30,577 --> 00:51:34,076
LAURA: I like walk by the door and see that
happening

773
00:51:34,076 --> 00:51:35,871
(laughter)

774
00:51:35,871 --> 00:51:38,396
SAM: But also just covering it up with a blanket
afterwards.

775
00:51:38,396 --> 00:51:41,424
MATT: Okay, well, you're in mid-process, this is
all happening very quickly.

776
00:51:41,662 --> 00:51:42,877
SAM: Oh. (grunts)

777
00:51:42,877 --> 00:51:47,792
ASHLEY: I'll go around back behind where Trinket
and Vex just went.

778
00:51:47,792 --> 00:51:51,741
MATT: Okay. Because of your little legs you get
about that far. Your little legs carry you.

779
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:53,681
SAM: I'm invisible. It's poop.

780
00:51:53,681 --> 00:51:55,597
(laughter)

781
00:51:55,597 --> 00:51:56,949
MATT: (sighs)

782
00:51:56,949 --> 00:52:00,342
(grunting and laughter)

783
00:52:00,342 --> 00:52:02,283
MARISHA: It's apparating poo.

784
00:52:02,283 --> 00:52:05,834
TALIESIN: I'm staying in the hallway,

785
00:52:06,003 --> 00:52:08,461
SAM: Scanlan's just like, I hate this mission.

786
00:52:08,461 --> 00:52:13,409
MATT: Okay, so. Tiberius, as you're backing up,
both the duergar turn around immediately, seeing

787
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:18,852
you, and rear back with javelins, throwing them
directly at you.

788
00:52:18,852 --> 00:52:22,819
ORION: Oh! I'll cast Blur instead.

789
00:52:22,819 --> 00:52:25,884
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll initiative real fast
to see who gets off first what.

790
00:52:25,884 --> 00:52:30,103
ORION: I'm not going to count that. Oh, I'll count
that. 19.

791
00:52:30,165 --> 00:52:32,622
(laughter)

792
00:52:32,674 --> 00:52:34,277
MATT: What, why didn't you count it?

793
00:52:34,277 --> 00:52:36,346
ORION: Because it flew out of my hand, I didn't
roll it.

794
00:52:36,346 --> 00:52:37,591
MATT: Okay. All right.

795
00:52:37,591 --> 00:52:38,675
ORION: Yeah.

796
00:52:38,675 --> 00:52:40,363
(laughter)

797
00:52:40,522 --> 00:52:42,231
ORION: It's on camera, tell them to play back.

798
00:52:42,231 --> 00:52:45,422
MATT: So you go ahead and cast Blur. You guys see
as Tiberius comes running back, (startled sounds).

799
00:52:45,422 --> 00:52:48,578
He manages to cast a spell really fast as two
javelins come flying towards him. His visible

800
00:52:48,578 --> 00:52:54,098
image begins to actually blur; the outline looks
almost like there's two mirror images of Tiberius

801
00:52:54,098 --> 00:52:57,234
in the same place that are both shimmering and
preventing them from actually telling where he's

802
00:52:57,234 --> 00:53:03,960
actually standing. The first javelin comes in at a
14.

803
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,376
ORION: Nope.

804
00:53:05,376 --> 00:53:06,961
MATT: Second one comes in at a 17.

805
00:53:06,961 --> 00:53:09,303
ORION: 17. Yes.

806
00:53:09,303 --> 00:53:13,945
MATT: Oh sorry, no, it's a four, 'cause it has
disadvantage. So both javelins just whish past.

807
00:53:13,945 --> 00:53:17,702
Looks like they pierced part of that kinda
shimmering blurring form, but both just ricochet

808
00:53:17,702 --> 00:53:22,977
off the walls of stone and come clattering to the
ground. Kinda near back where Kima and Grog are.

809
00:53:22,977 --> 00:53:24,852
They both step out of the way as they land.

810
00:53:24,852 --> 00:53:25,815
MARISHA: Ha-ha.

811
00:53:25,815 --> 00:53:29,454
MATT: All right, so that brings us to-- that was
your action. Who else wants

812
00:53:29,454 --> 00:53:30,923
to take the next action?

813
00:53:30,923 --> 00:53:32,187
LIAM: I'm gonna hold.

814
00:53:32,187 --> 00:53:34,784
LAURA: I can't see anything, can I, from where I
am?

815
00:53:34,784 --> 00:53:36,528
MATT: It's kinda dark, and you can see movement in
the distance.

816
00:53:36,528 --> 00:53:38,772
LAURA: Can I hop on Trinket's back and see if I
can see higher?

817
00:53:38,772 --> 00:53:43,117
MATT: You can try. All right. So you hop on the
back of Trinket, (laughs) looking over the top,

818
00:53:43,117 --> 00:53:46,376
and you know Grog is kinda blocking part of your
view, but you can see, with your low-light vision,

819
00:53:46,376 --> 00:53:52,995
what looks to be Tiberius' form shimmering and two
duergar-height individuals that are partially

820
00:53:52,995 --> 00:53:58,024
blocked by him. So they do have partial cover, or
three-quarters cover. Do you have the feat that

821
00:53:58,024 --> 00:53:59,118
ignores that?

822
00:53:59,118 --> 00:54:02,253
LAURA: I don't know? I don't know.

823
00:54:02,253 --> 00:54:06,335
MATT: (laughs) Because you don't know I'm going to
say no.

824
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,791
TALIESIN: It would be called Sharpshooter.

825
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:09,183
MATT: Yeah it would be called Sharpshooter, is the
feat.

826
00:54:09,183 --> 00:54:10,378
LAURA: No, I don't have that.

827
00:54:10,378 --> 00:54:16,834
MATT: Okay, yeah. So go ahead and roll for attack
on one or both duergar, up to you.

828
00:54:16,834 --> 00:54:21,293
LAURA: 21.

829
00:54:21,293 --> 00:54:22,457
MATT: Okay.

830
00:54:22,457 --> 00:54:24,980
LAURA: And 23.

831
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:31,159
MATT: Okay. The 21 misses, the 23 hits. Because
they have cover and because it's so dark it's

832
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:33,850
difficult to make out their form, but you do
manage to hit one with the arrow.

833
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:35,469
LAURA: Okay. I Hunter's Mark him.

834
00:54:35,469 --> 00:54:40,343
MATT: Okay. Next time, make sure you do that
before you attack. Otherwise it won't count for

835
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:41,564
the attack.

836
00:54:41,564 --> 00:54:52,595
LAURA: Okay. Okay. 13, uh, 12! (laughs) Math! Stay
in school.

837
00:54:52,595 --> 00:54:56,665
MATT: (laughs) All right. There you go. 12, then
add your Hunter's Mark bonus to that as well.

838
00:54:56,665 --> 00:54:57,931
LAURA: Oh, good, one.

839
00:54:57,931 --> 00:55:01,560
MATT: All right, gotcha. So one arrow sinks in the
shoulder, but doesn't appear to be stopping his

840
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:07,702
angry advance towards Tiberius. Let's see. You're
staying where you are?

841
00:55:07,702 --> 00:55:08,812
LIAM: Waiting.

842
00:55:08,812 --> 00:55:12,405
MATT: All right. You guys are actually kind of
like pinched off in the hallway right here, so as

843
00:55:12,478 --> 00:55:13,816
you guys are all kind of--

844
00:55:13,816 --> 00:55:15,704
SAM: (strained) Don't say 'pinched off' to me.

845
00:55:15,704 --> 00:55:17,158
(laughter)

846
00:55:17,158 --> 00:55:20,860
MATT: -- as you're doing this, Tiberius, you're
right there. The two duergar catch up to you and

847
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:24,040
both, now that their javelins are out of their
hands, pull out their hammers with their bonus

848
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,792
actions and come down at you with an attack each.

849
00:55:26,792 --> 00:55:29,699
MARISHA: Run, Tiberius!

850
00:55:29,699 --> 00:55:31,344
MATT: That's gonna be a six.

851
00:55:31,344 --> 00:55:32,412
ORION: No.

852
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,024
MATT: And a 17.

853
00:55:34,024 --> 00:55:35,567
ORION: 17 hits.

854
00:55:35,567 --> 00:55:40,576
MATT: Okay, yeah, that Blur is saving you, man.
All right, so as the one-- both the duergar are

855
00:55:40,576 --> 00:55:43,641
kinda like swelling with frustration, anger. It's
an ability, you've now gotten to the point where

856
00:55:43,641 --> 00:55:47,117
you can see, these duergar can actually
temporarily increase their form for stronger blows

857
00:55:47,117 --> 00:55:53,678
and attacks. Comes and strikes you for 12 points
of bludgeoning damage as the hammer comes cracking

858
00:55:53,678 --> 00:55:58,248
down, finding purchase on your torso, and it kinda
pushes you back a few inches. That's gonna bruise

859
00:55:58,248 --> 00:55:59,439
tomorrow morning.

860
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:05,824
MARISHA: Can I do a combo move with Grog, assuming
that he would agree with me that it's gonna be

861
00:56:05,824 --> 00:56:06,903
super cool?

862
00:56:06,903 --> 00:56:08,727
MATT: He'd probably agree with you, what do you
wanna do?

863
00:56:08,727 --> 00:56:17,616
MARISHA: Okay. (laughs) Thanks, Grog! So since
Grog's kind of there-- Can we arrange like a

864
00:56:17,616 --> 00:56:26,872
fastball special, almost? So have him like kind of
go up and crouch and I'm gonna bust out--

865
00:56:26,872 --> 00:56:29,492
MATT: How are you going to communicate this to
Grog?

866
00:56:29,492 --> 00:56:31,357
MARISHA: He-- with--

867
00:56:31,357 --> 00:56:32,436
LIAM: (meows)

868
00:56:32,436 --> 00:56:35,033
(laughter)

869
00:56:35,054 --> 00:56:38,053
MATT: I'm gonna have to say, unfortunately, that's
not gonna work out for this moment. Grog's

870
00:56:38,053 --> 00:56:40,939
attention is on the duergar and you are a giant
cat.

871
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,296
LIAM: Hey, I'm gonna sneak behind Tiberius and
stab that guy.

872
00:56:43,296 --> 00:56:45,249
LAURA: It would've been so cool, though.

873
00:56:45,249 --> 00:56:46,826
ASHLEY: That would've been really cool.

874
00:56:46,826 --> 00:56:53,251
LIAM: And since Tiberius is there, I can get sneak
attack damage, 'cause one of my allies is there--

875
00:56:53,251 --> 00:56:56,210
MATT: All right, just a second there, you're still
holding, let's finish Keyleth. So Keyleth, what

876
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:57,373
are you doing?

877
00:56:57,373 --> 00:56:59,961
MARISHA: Well, is Grog in my way?

878
00:56:59,961 --> 00:57:02,575
MATT: Grog is there. You can attempt to leap over
Grog.

879
00:57:02,575 --> 00:57:06,734
MARISHA: I was wanting to vault off Grog's back,
is what I was wanting to do.

880
00:57:06,734 --> 00:57:08,214
MATT: You can do that without asking him.

881
00:57:08,214 --> 00:57:09,470
MARISHA: Yeah, that's what I was going to do.

882
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:11,347
MATT: No, you were saying you wanted to tell Grog
you were going to do that. But yes, you can still

883
00:57:11,347 --> 00:57:13,042
do it. So go ahead and roll an acrobatics check.

884
00:57:13,042 --> 00:57:14,945
MARISHA: No, you asked how I was communicating
it.

885
00:57:14,945 --> 00:57:16,804
LAURA: Just do it, Keyleth!

886
00:57:16,804 --> 00:57:23,131
MARISHA: So I'm gonna come out and I'm gonna vault
off his back and try and do a pounce over top of

887
00:57:23,131 --> 00:57:28,316
Tiberius for that duergar that's closest to you.
What am I rolling?

888
00:57:28,316 --> 00:57:29,187
TALIESIN: Acrobatics.

889
00:57:29,187 --> 00:57:30,722
MARISHA: Acrobatics? Is this an acrobatics thing?

890
00:57:30,722 --> 00:57:34,499
MATT: Yes. From around the corner, you pull back,
leap up, jump onto Grog's back and attempt to

891
00:57:34,499 --> 00:57:35,931
spring off of it.

892
00:57:35,931 --> 00:57:37,135
MARISHA: 11.

893
00:57:37,135 --> 00:57:47,474
MATT: 11, okay. (laughs) All right. So you jump
off of Grog's back. Grog, not expecting it,

894
00:57:47,474 --> 00:57:52,638
instinctively ducks down and the force you push
off, as he's not aware there's going to be a giant

895
00:57:52,638 --> 00:57:53,560
cat there--

896
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,927
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

897
00:57:54,973 --> 00:57:57,748
MATT: -- in doing so, it doesn't give you the
momentum you need. You are able to jump over him

898
00:57:57,748 --> 00:58:01,485
and get kind of into center of the fray. But you
do not have the pounce attack, unfortunately.

899
00:58:01,485 --> 00:58:02,948
MARISHA: Okay. That's fine.

900
00:58:02,948 --> 00:58:04,464
MATT: But it gets you there, at least.

901
00:58:04,464 --> 00:58:06,103
MARISHA: Oh, can I not attack?

902
00:58:06,103 --> 00:58:07,368
MATT: You can attack, yeah.

903
00:58:07,368 --> 00:58:11,494
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. I'm gonna go ahead and
do my bite attack.

904
00:58:11,494 --> 00:58:12,522
MATT: Go for it.

905
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:15,611
MARISHA: I'm gonna go right for his throat. Still
with the same intention that I had in mind.

906
00:58:15,611 --> 00:58:17,921
MATT: Okay, this is the one that took the arrow
from Laura.

907
00:58:17,921 --> 00:58:19,267
MARISHA: Okay, 17.

908
00:58:19,267 --> 00:58:21,859
MATT: 17? That hits. Go ahead and roll for damage.

909
00:58:21,859 --> 00:58:28,968
MARISHA: 1d10 plus five. Where's my d10s? Ten
damage. Piercing damage.

910
00:58:28,968 --> 00:58:33,740
MATT: Ten piercing damage, all right. So, as you
rush forward, you bite at him. You see he pulls

911
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:37,427
back, but you get a big, meaty chunk of his
forearm and clamp down, and you feel a snap, some

912
00:58:37,427 --> 00:58:41,111
sort of bone in the middle of his arm and he gives
out a horrible-- (yells) sound, as he takes the

913
00:58:41,111 --> 00:58:45,212
butt of his hammer and hits you on the snout.
Doesn't do any damage, but it's enough to get you

914
00:58:45,212 --> 00:58:49,663
to kind of let go of your grip a little bit, and
he rips his arm out of your jaws. Leaving that

915
00:58:49,663 --> 00:58:53,616
kind of nasty, irony taste of duergar blood, that
you've now become accustomed to, unfortunately.

916
00:58:53,616 --> 00:58:58,632
That ends the round. Now you have Tiberius and a
cat in your way.

917
00:58:58,632 --> 00:58:59,985
MARISHA: (meows)

918
00:58:59,985 --> 00:59:01,730
LIAM: Do the doors go in or out, that I'm by?

919
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:02,738
MATT: The doors go in.

920
00:59:02,738 --> 00:59:05,837
LIAM: In. So I'm just gonna go like this (hinges
creak) and throw a dagger and say peek-a-boo at

921
00:59:05,837 --> 00:59:07,004
the same time.

922
00:59:07,004 --> 00:59:08,086
(laughter)

923
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,870
MATT: Okay. As you step out (fwip).

924
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:12,176
LIAM: That is a 29 to hit.

925
00:59:12,176 --> 00:59:13,258
MATT: That does hit.

926
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,188
LIAM: Okay.

927
00:59:14,188 --> 00:59:16,280
MATT: You do not get sneak attack bonus,
unfortunately.

928
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:20,565
LIAM: Even though my ally is five feet away from
him? I thought I remembered that rule.

929
00:59:20,565 --> 00:59:22,254
MATT: You do if you are in melee with them.

930
00:59:22,254 --> 00:59:23,676
LAURA: Oh, right.

931
00:59:23,676 --> 00:59:25,975
MATT: You get the bonus if you're both like
flanking them, or you're like harrying them in

932
00:59:25,975 --> 00:59:27,953
combat. Because you're at a distance, you don't
get the bonus.

933
00:59:27,953 --> 00:59:32,482
LIAM: Okay, so that is a nine. And then I'm going
to follow-- the nine of damage.

934
00:59:32,482 --> 00:59:33,486
MATT: All right.

935
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:35,777
LIAM: And immediately follow up with my other
dagger, which also hits.

936
00:59:35,777 --> 00:59:39,572
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll damage on the
second dagger. Which is 1d4 plus what?

937
00:59:39,572 --> 00:59:41,836
LIAM: Six. That's a nine.

938
00:59:41,836 --> 00:59:50,048
MATT: Nine, okay. So, after the guy rips his arm
out of Keyleth's face, essentially, a dagger comes

939
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:53,387
swinging out from behind the doorway, stabs him in
the other shoulder. You see he looks down at it

940
00:59:53,387 --> 00:59:57,520
confused for a second, and as that dagger vanishes
in a puff of dark smoke, returning to your-- the

941
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:01,309
side of your hilt, he looks up just in time to see
the second dagger catch him right in the middle of

942
01:00:01,309 --> 01:00:05,844
the forehead, and he just falls onto his back at
that point, unmoving. That duergar is stripped.

943
01:00:05,904 --> 01:00:07,106
LAURA: What-what!

944
01:00:07,106 --> 01:00:12,223
MATT: Who's up next? Who wants to do anything? Who
hasn't done anything yet this action?

945
01:00:12,288 --> 01:00:15,017
SAM: Is there is a door next to me for another
room?

946
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:16,154
MATT: You're just finishing.

947
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,309
SAM: Oh, I'm just finishing, okay.

948
01:00:17,309 --> 01:00:19,775
MATT: Sorry. So, Pike, have you done anything
yet?

949
01:00:19,775 --> 01:00:22,538
ASHLEY: Can I-- Is there a door there? Somewhere,
right there?

950
01:00:22,538 --> 01:00:24,817
MATT: You move around here, there is a door over here,
yes.

951
01:00:24,878 --> 01:00:28,956
ASHLEY: I can't really do anything. Check it out,
check it out.

952
01:00:28,956 --> 01:00:30,682
LIAM: Yeah, bust in. You can't stealth.

953
01:00:30,682 --> 01:00:32,597
MATT: The door is a secondary guest room.

954
01:00:32,597 --> 01:00:34,613
LIAM: And now, poop on this bed.

955
01:00:34,613 --> 01:00:36,081
ASHLEY: All right.

956
01:00:36,081 --> 01:00:39,291
(laughter)

957
01:00:39,291 --> 01:00:42,370
TALIESIN: I can't do anything that could make
noise anyway.

958
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:49,398
MATT: It is a guest room of equal design and
dressing as the one that Scanlan, you are unaware,

959
01:00:49,398 --> 01:00:50,698
is currently fouling.

960
01:00:50,698 --> 01:00:52,904
(laughter)

961
01:00:52,904 --> 01:00:59,259
ASHLEY: Maybe I get a sudden urge for some reason
to just poo on the bed.

962
01:00:59,259 --> 01:01:02,048
(laughter)

963
01:01:02,048 --> 01:01:08,582
MATT: You can do what you want. Be aware, Pike as
a character has her intent, the more you stray

964
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:11,557
from that, the more it will have ramifications for
her in the end.

965
01:01:11,557 --> 01:01:14,606
ASHLEY: Yes, I know, I'm just kidding, That's not
what, that's not what I want to do. I was just,

966
01:01:14,606 --> 01:01:17,014
had this feeling that Scanlan was doing something
and I felt that--

967
01:01:17,014 --> 01:01:21,008
SAM: She could probably hear, muffled from behind
the door, (grunts).

968
01:01:21,008 --> 01:01:29,171
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'll just-- I guess I can't do
anything while I'm in there, so? Can I just--

969
01:01:29,171 --> 01:01:33,244
MATT: That's about as far as you're able to move.
You can still use your action if you wanted to do

970
01:01:33,244 --> 01:01:37,541
anything, but right now your vision is currently
fairly well-blocked by a woman and a bear, and a

971
01:01:37,541 --> 01:01:38,956
man the size of a bear.

972
01:01:38,956 --> 01:01:41,334
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay, so I'll just hang out there.

973
01:01:41,334 --> 01:01:48,646
MATT: Okay, so that brings us back to Kima, who
currently doesn't have any sort of way of getting

974
01:01:48,646 --> 01:01:51,854
over there, kind of frustrating, trying 
to find a way over.

975
01:01:51,854 --> 01:01:53,975
MARISHA: It's a narrow hallway.

976
01:01:54,136 --> 01:01:57,172
MATT: Clarota, who is still invisible, is just gonna
hold on that point.

977
01:01:57,216 --> 01:02:01,167
ORION: As everybody is doing this, I'm going to--
why are you blocking me, I'm not supposed to be

978
01:02:01,167 --> 01:02:04,089
this close to this thing! Keep going.

979
01:02:04,089 --> 01:02:08,464
MATT: Okay, Percy! Stand there? All right, Tiberius,
you're up.

980
01:02:08,464 --> 01:02:15,080
ORION: Oh, like I was saying. Well, shit.

981
01:02:15,127 --> 01:02:26,371
SAM: Aren't you right next to the guy? Kill him.

982
01:02:26,533 --> 01:02:29,677
MATT: Do it quick, or we are gonna move for the
next turn.

983
01:02:29,677 --> 01:02:35,125
ORION: Okay, I'll just lift up my hand and go,
Firebolt.

984
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:39,123
MATT: Okay, point-blank Firebolt. Go ahead and
roll your spell attack.

985
01:02:39,123 --> 01:02:45,681
ORION: Okay, okay, 20.

986
01:02:45,681 --> 01:02:52,316
MATT: 20, all right. That'll hit, go ahead and roll for
damage for the Firebolt.

987
01:02:52,316 --> 01:02:59,832
ORION: Okay, ten, 18, 20, 21, 23.

988
01:02:59,832 --> 01:03:05,528
MATT: 23 damage? All right. So as you
instinctively pull back, you release the blast of

989
01:03:05,528 --> 01:03:10,297
Firebolt energy, the duergar who is currently
harrying you with this warhammer takes the brunt

990
01:03:10,374 --> 01:03:16,308
of it right to the bottom of his face and his
torso. The studded leather armor that he's wearing

991
01:03:16,356 --> 01:03:20,983
tears open with a sheer flaming burst of the
impact of it, and you see most of his skin is

992
01:03:20,983 --> 01:03:26,295
charred and burned at that point. He reels back for a
second, looking very, very hurt but not quite put

993
01:03:26,356 --> 01:03:27,482
down yet.

994
01:03:27,482 --> 01:03:35,294
ORION: As my bonus action, I'm gonna spend two
sorcery points and do it again. So I roll for

995
01:03:35,294 --> 01:03:38,682
that. It's a 22.

996
01:03:38,682 --> 01:03:44,445
MATT: All right, the second blast, as he reaches
back, before he can get a chance to get back to

997
01:03:44,477 --> 01:03:48,399
his feet, the second blast hits. This time, it sends
him off his feet, flying about five to ten feet

998
01:03:48,448 --> 01:03:50,042
back, skidding across the ground.

999
01:03:50,042 --> 01:03:51,200
ORION: 15 damage.

1000
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:58,096
MATT: Yes, and that puts him, still on the floor,
laid out with a burning, kind of crippling, crispy

1001
01:03:58,096 --> 01:04:02,769
scent in the air of what was once a standing
duergar, now dead and burning on the ground.

1002
01:04:02,769 --> 01:04:10,101
MARISHA: So once again I grab him by the scruff,
take him, and put him in the bathroom.

1003
01:04:10,171 --> 01:04:14,297
LIAM: I give a couple of pats on Tiberius's
shoulder and start to inch down the hall.

1004
01:04:14,347 --> 01:04:18,690
MATT: All right, as you guys are doing this,
Scanlan steps out of the guest room, getting his

1005
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:20,165
pantaloons back on.

1006
01:04:20,165 --> 01:04:21,862
SAM: My invisible pantaloons.

1007
01:04:21,862 --> 01:04:26,453
MATT: Yes. You hear the footprints of Scanlan,
you being still invisible, you essentially just--

1008
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:34,349
SAM: I phantom pooped. Did I find anything in
there, by the way?

1009
01:04:34,367 --> 01:04:36,116
LIAM: Just relief.

1010
01:04:36,116 --> 01:04:39,753
MATT: You found a fun way to prank duergar.

1011
01:04:39,753 --> 01:04:41,784
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, did I find anything in the
barracks?

1012
01:04:41,784 --> 01:04:43,621
MATT: Over there? No.

1013
01:04:43,621 --> 01:04:49,484
TALIESIN: Did Liam-- Did Vax find anything shiny
in the room? The shiny thing.

1014
01:04:49,484 --> 01:04:54,257
LIAM: No, I got interrupted. That's a good idea,
thanks for the reminder, Percy.

1015
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:55,706
TALIESIN: You're welcome, yes.

1016
01:04:55,706 --> 01:04:59,371
LIAM: Checking for-- I checked for traps
before, but I can't remember what I rolled. I'm

1017
01:04:59,539 --> 01:05:00,933
sure it was successful.

1018
01:05:00,933 --> 01:05:02,222
MATT: Go ahead and roll again.

1019
01:05:02,222 --> 01:05:03,749
(laughter)

1020
01:05:03,749 --> 01:05:04,768
LIAM: 17.

1021
01:05:04,768 --> 01:05:09,621
MATT: Okay, as you push the door open and get a
glance inside of the main hall, you don't see any

1022
01:05:09,621 --> 01:05:10,928
traps across the floor.

1023
01:05:10,928 --> 01:05:12,658
LIAM: Okay, I'm gonna go check out the shiny
thing.

1024
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:14,864
MATT: Okay. Everyone else staying out in the
hallway?

1025
01:05:14,864 --> 01:05:16,126
SAM: I'm coming with him.

1026
01:05:16,126 --> 01:05:16,812
MATT: Okay.

1027
01:05:16,872 --> 01:05:18,266
SAM: If I can get there.

1028
01:05:18,266 --> 01:05:21,635
MATT: You manage to scoot through, dancing around
folks, people kind of let you get by.

1029
01:05:21,635 --> 01:05:22,825
Anyone else?

1030
01:05:22,825 --> 01:05:25,510
LAURA: Yeah, sure, I like shiny things.

1031
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:31,336
MARISHA: I'm burying my shame, again. Burying the
duergar.

1032
01:05:31,336 --> 01:05:34,261
MATT: So, you're dragging the duergar over in
the--

1033
01:05:34,261 --> 01:05:35,534
TALIESIN: I'll go in, too.

1034
01:05:35,534 --> 01:05:37,752
ASHLEY: I'll follow, I'll follow.

1035
01:05:37,752 --> 01:05:40,192
LAURA: We're all going. It's a big, happy room.

1036
01:05:40,192 --> 01:05:42,410
LIAM: So say we all.

1037
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:44,572
MARISHA: Well, I guess I'll go after I bury
duergar.

1038
01:05:44,572 --> 01:05:49,759
MATT: Yes, as you guys step in here, move up
towards the back corner, where there's the shiny

1039
01:05:49,759 --> 01:05:52,172
glint. Tiberius, you stay inside or outside?

1040
01:05:52,172 --> 01:05:55,381
ORION: I'm going to wait for everybody to go inside.

1041
01:05:55,381 --> 01:05:58,043
MARISHA: We will be Team Outside Posse.

1042
01:05:58,043 --> 01:06:04,432
MATT: Kima walks in, Grog goes to start making his
way in. As he does, you go over towards the

1043
01:06:04,432 --> 01:06:09,577
glimmer. The glimmer on the table, you look, it's
just formless and kind of this weird spark of

1044
01:06:09,577 --> 01:06:13,352
light. It then vanishes, and the doors that you
guys entered--

1045
01:06:13,421 --> 01:06:14,982
LAURA: (singsong) It's a trap.

1046
01:06:14,982 --> 01:06:20,342
MATT: -- slam behind you, with Tiberius, Grog and
Keyleth all kept outside of the room.

1047
01:06:20,342 --> 01:06:21,488
ASHLEY: No!

1048
01:06:21,488 --> 01:06:26,556
MATT: The rest of you guys, the flames go to
darkness and the entire room goes pitch-black.

1049
01:06:26,556 --> 01:06:27,863
MARISHA: Oh, shit!

1050
01:06:27,863 --> 01:06:29,146
LAURA: Oh, no, we don't have light.

1051
01:06:29,146 --> 01:06:31,568
LIAM: In the darkness, I say, fuck!

1052
01:06:31,568 --> 01:06:33,942
(laughter)

1053
01:06:33,942 --> 01:06:35,397
LAURA: Stupid, stupid, stupid!

1054
01:06:35,397 --> 01:06:38,627
ORION: I motion to Grog and I'm like, you know
what to do, damn it.

1055
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:44,830
MATT: Grog's gonna go for the door, however, at
this point in time, I'm going to ask for--

1056
01:06:44,894 --> 01:06:47,922
LAURA: Can we stealth? I mean, I guess we're all
kind of--

1057
01:06:47,922 --> 01:06:49,385
SAM: Ask for?

1058
01:06:49,385 --> 01:06:52,608
LIAM: Roll for Deus ex Machina.

1059
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:55,333
SAM: Oh, You're gonna ask the chat room
something?

1060
01:06:55,333 --> 01:06:58,986
MATT: No, no, no. I'm not. I'm working
out what's actually gonna happen here. All right,

1061
01:06:59,059 --> 01:07:13,589
so, suddenly there is a cacophonous bit of pain
streaking through Pike, Vex, and Clarota. Guys, go

1062
01:07:13,589 --> 01:07:16,851
ahead and make an intelligence saving throw.

1063
01:07:16,851 --> 01:07:18,320
SAM: Intelligence?

1064
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,370
LAURA: All of us?

1065
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:20,715
SAM: Some sort of a mind thing.

1066
01:07:20,715 --> 01:07:21,958
LAURA: Oh, crud.

1067
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:25,061
MARISHA: Intelligence.

1068
01:07:25,061 --> 01:07:29,056
LAURA: Oh, oh, oh! Oh, no, I don't get any
advantage in this.

1069
01:07:29,056 --> 01:07:30,539
LIAM: 13.

1070
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:34,175
MATT: Not you, just you two. So what's the--

1071
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:35,873
TALIESIN: Never mind, that was such a good roll.

1072
01:07:35,873 --> 01:07:38,478
ASHLEY: What was that? That's a one. (laughs)

1073
01:07:38,478 --> 01:07:39,614
MATT: Okay.

1074
01:07:39,614 --> 01:07:40,955
ASHLEY: I rolled a one!

1075
01:07:40,955 --> 01:07:46,648
MATT: So in the darkness, suddenly there is this
searing pain, like some sort of screaming sound is

1076
01:07:46,648 --> 01:07:52,077
blasting you from the inside of your very mind.
You two are both currently stunned.

1077
01:07:52,077 --> 01:07:53,313
LAURA: Oh, crud.

1078
01:07:53,313 --> 01:07:54,701
SAM: Who's you two?

1079
01:07:54,701 --> 01:07:56,100
LAURA: Me and Pike.

1080
01:07:56,100 --> 01:08:03,035
ASHLEY: I did bad things, I did bad things. I
shouldn't have killed a man while he was down.

1081
01:08:03,035 --> 01:08:08,398
Wait, so what does that-- That means we just can't
do anything, right?

1082
01:08:08,398 --> 01:08:11,907
MATT: On every turn, you get to try and break
that, but right now neither of you can--

1083
01:08:11,907 --> 01:08:15,098
MARISHA: Every turn they have to try and break out
of it? It keeps going?

1084
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,959
It's like a keep-going thing?

1085
01:08:16,959 --> 01:08:20,520
MATT: You both just sit there, grasping your
heads, just screaming in pain as your body is

1086
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:25,970
unable to function or listen to any thought
process. Clarota also unfortunately falls victim

1087
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:29,607
to this and is also unable to make any actions.

1088
01:08:29,607 --> 01:08:30,761
SAM: Oh boy!

1089
01:08:30,761 --> 01:08:35,715
LIAM: I'm pulling out my flametongue dagger to try
to get a little bit of light in here.

1090
01:08:35,715 --> 01:08:42,591
MATT: All right, however-- You, as you are
currently pulling out your flametongue dagger, you

1091
01:08:42,591 --> 01:08:47,983
feel a presence nearby, and with a little bit of
embers around the fire, you see, out of nothing, a

1092
01:08:47,983 --> 01:08:53,748
figure step into view that apparently was not
visible but a moment before. A tall, lithe figure,

1093
01:08:53,748 --> 01:08:59,057
with long limbs, fingers and a wrapping of facial
tentacles coming towards your face.

1094
01:08:59,057 --> 01:09:00,648
SAM: It was invisible.

1095
01:09:00,648 --> 01:09:02,907
LIAM: I see him, I'm gonna stab, I'm just gonna stab.

1096
01:09:02,907 --> 01:09:05,609
MATT: Before you get the chance to stab, you get a
surprise attack from this guy.

1097
01:09:05,609 --> 01:09:07,809
LAURA: Oh, no, what if he sucks our brains out?

1098
01:09:07,809 --> 01:09:14,105
MATT: All right, that comes to an 18 versus armor
class.

1099
01:09:14,105 --> 01:09:15,673
LIAM: Yeah, he got me.

1100
01:09:15,673 --> 01:09:20,352
MATT: So, as you go back for your blade to pull it
out, he grabs you by the shoulders and pulls you,

1101
01:09:20,352 --> 01:09:24,267
and the tentacles wrap around your face and pull
you into this horrible toothy maw. You feel this

1102
01:09:24,273 --> 01:09:28,071
tearing pain sensation as its teeth begin to dig
into your face.

1103
01:09:28,071 --> 01:09:29,561
ASHLEY: No, no, no, no.

1104
01:09:29,731 --> 01:09:32,860
LAURA: Oh my god, he's gonna die.

1105
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:35,357
LIAM: That hurts. A lot.

1106
01:09:35,357 --> 01:09:43,496
MATT: You take 17 points of psychic damage as the
actual presence of the tentacles pulling on your

1107
01:09:43,496 --> 01:09:47,399
face, you feel it's kind of grabbing your brain
and trying to hold it in place. You are currently

1108
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:48,803
considered grappled.

1109
01:09:48,803 --> 01:09:50,118
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

1110
01:09:50,118 --> 01:09:57,176
MATT: Now, guys, everyone roll initiative. That
was a surprise round.

1111
01:09:57,176 --> 01:09:59,141
MARISHA: Surprise round.

1112
01:09:59,141 --> 01:10:00,268
MATT: Yes.

1113
01:10:00,268 --> 01:10:02,360
MARISHA: 'Cause they got the drop on us

1114
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,948
TALIESIN: That'll do.

1115
01:10:04,948 --> 01:10:08,740
ORION: What's going on in there? I hear lots of
ruckus.

1116
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:10,524
SAM: We'll be out in a minute.

1117
01:10:10,524 --> 01:10:17,732
ORION: Don't give me that, Scanlan. Oh. Scanlan,
you can hear me. What's going on in there?

1118
01:10:17,732 --> 01:10:19,522
SAM: We're all dying.

1119
01:10:19,522 --> 01:10:22,769
ORION: I turn to Grog. They're all dying.

1120
01:10:22,769 --> 01:10:27,082
MATT: (laughs) All right, so 25 to 20?

1121
01:10:27,082 --> 01:10:28,879
SAM: No one.

1122
01:10:28,879 --> 01:10:35,415
MATT: All right, 25 to 20, no one-- almost forgot,
go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw.

1123
01:10:35,459 --> 01:10:42,213
LIAM: 23.

1124
01:10:42,213 --> 01:10:46,717
MATT: 23, all right, you feel the presence of its
mind pressing into your brain and you manage to,

1125
01:10:46,717 --> 01:10:51,366
through the pain of its tentacles pulling you
towards its mouth, shrug off its current attempt

1126
01:10:51,366 --> 01:10:53,023
to push into your mind.

1127
01:10:53,023 --> 01:10:54,672
LIAM: I'm thinking of the middle finger.

1128
01:10:54,672 --> 01:11:00,577
MATT: That's a good thing. Okay. So you're still
grappled but you're not stunned.

1129
01:11:00,577 --> 01:11:02,566
SAM: Is he a piece on the board yet?

1130
01:11:02,566 --> 01:11:06,076
MATT: Both of them are now visible right there.
All right, so, 25 to 20?

1131
01:11:06,076 --> 01:11:07,303
LAURA: Nobody.

1132
01:11:07,303 --> 01:11:08,696
MATT: 20 to 15?

1133
01:11:08,696 --> 01:11:09,809
LIAM: 17.

1134
01:11:09,809 --> 01:11:10,790
TALIESIN: 16.

1135
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:11,764
ORION: 17.

1136
01:11:11,764 --> 01:11:28,632
MATT: 17 and 16, all right. So actually, Grog is
going first. All right, and Percy. 15 to ten? Ten

1137
01:11:28,632 --> 01:11:29,595
to five?

1138
01:11:29,595 --> 01:11:31,144
MARISHA: Oh, oh, wait, 13.

1139
01:11:31,144 --> 01:11:32,805
(laughter)

1140
01:11:32,805 --> 01:11:34,344
MARISHA: Sorry, I was thinking about shit.

1141
01:11:34,344 --> 01:11:36,105
MATT: That's okay. Ten to five?

1142
01:11:36,105 --> 01:11:37,268
LAURA: Nine.

1143
01:11:37,268 --> 01:11:39,232
TALIESIN: Thinking about shit.

1144
01:11:39,232 --> 01:11:42,948
MARISHA: Thinking about life and death. (laughs)

1145
01:11:42,948 --> 01:11:44,361
TALIESIN: Word.

1146
01:11:44,361 --> 01:11:46,000
MATT: All right.

1147
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:46,775
SAM: Two.

1148
01:11:46,775 --> 01:11:48,882
ASHLEY: Oh, so did I. Best friends.

1149
01:11:48,882 --> 01:11:51,183
SAM: Besties. Twinsies.

1150
01:11:51,183 --> 01:11:53,249
ASHLEY: Gnomesies.

1151
01:11:53,249 --> 01:11:55,663
(laughter)

1152
01:11:55,663 --> 01:12:06,272
SAM: We're still-- Mr. Dungeon Master, sir, this
is all the same day.

1153
01:12:06,272 --> 01:12:08,292
I don't get any of my spells back?

1154
01:12:08,292 --> 01:12:13,768
MATT: No, you guys have not rested. All right, so
first, the top actually-- Kima is at the top of

1155
01:12:13,768 --> 01:12:15,368
the initiative order.

1156
01:12:15,368 --> 01:12:20,449
MARISHA: Kima, get it girl, get it, get it girl.

1157
01:12:20,449 --> 01:12:25,354
MATT: Kima angrily leaps on top of the table and
goes running down with an angry yell, and leaps

1158
01:12:25,354 --> 01:12:30,106
down toward the one that's currently grabbing onto
you with its grapple. As she's running a little

1159
01:12:30,106 --> 01:12:34,020
bit of light bursts, as you can see this divine
energy begin to burst and glow off the edge of the

1160
01:12:34,226 --> 01:12:37,937
greatsword that she's holding. She leaps down,
and with a giant arc through the air that lights

1161
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:44,421
up that portion of the room with a brief sweep,
the blade comes down towards-- oh, that'll hit.

1162
01:12:44,421 --> 01:12:47,227
Second attack also hits.

1163
01:12:47,227 --> 01:12:48,414
ASHLEY: Yes, go Kima.

1164
01:12:48,414 --> 01:13:02,076
MATT: So that comes to-- okay, using her Divine
Smite ability on top of that, she manages to deal

1165
01:13:02,076 --> 01:13:04,273
37 points of damage to it.

1166
01:13:04,273 --> 01:13:05,694
TALIESIN: Damn.

1167
01:13:05,694 --> 01:13:14,689
MATT: As she finishes both of her strikes
simultaneously. The mindflayer, however, does not

1168
01:13:14,689 --> 01:13:20,106
release its grasp on you. You are still considered
grappled. That ends her turn. Grog now is gonna

1169
01:13:20,106 --> 01:13:24,578
angrily attempt to bash into this door, is gonna
make an-- actually no, no athletics check, he's

1170
01:13:24,578 --> 01:13:28,446
going to go into a rage and hitting away at the
door.

1171
01:13:28,446 --> 01:13:31,964
(growling)

1172
01:13:31,964 --> 01:13:36,873
LIAM and LAURA: (Grog voice) I would like to
rage.

1173
01:13:36,873 --> 01:13:39,383
(laughter)

1174
01:13:39,383 --> 01:13:46,085
MATT: All right, that puts a total of 32 points of
damage, that's enough. So Grog just takes two big

1175
01:13:46,085 --> 01:13:50,423
swings. The first one comes through, cracks the
door in half, splitting it down the center. Rears

1176
01:13:50,423 --> 01:13:53,994
back a second time, cleaves through the door
entirely. What little bit is left on the hinges,

1177
01:13:53,994 --> 01:13:59,534
he kicks out with his foot, leaving now this side
completely open to the interior. He then moves in

1178
01:13:59,534 --> 01:14:07,752
around Clarota. That's as far as he can get in
this current turn. That brings us to Vax.

1179
01:14:07,752 --> 01:14:10,488
LIAM: What can I do while grappled, nothing until
I'm ungrappled?

1180
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:13,400
MATT: Well, no, you can try and make an acrobatics
or athletics roll against them

1181
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,896
to try and break free.

1182
01:14:14,896 --> 01:14:17,623
LIAM: Okay, but then do I have an action once
that's done or that's the action?

1183
01:14:17,623 --> 01:14:19,469
MATT: I'll let you use that as your move.

1184
01:14:19,469 --> 01:14:23,277
LIAM: All right, so I'm gonna try to use, I guess
athletics is what I would do.

1185
01:14:23,277 --> 01:14:25,019
MATT: Or acrobatics, up to you, whichever's
higher.

1186
01:14:25,019 --> 01:14:27,373
LIAM: Well, that would be acrobatics.

1187
01:14:27,373 --> 01:14:28,866
MATT: Acrobatics, then.

1188
01:14:28,866 --> 01:14:29,958
LIAM: 27.

1189
01:14:29,958 --> 01:14:30,957
MATT: 27?

1190
01:14:30,957 --> 01:14:31,941
LIAM: Yeah.

1191
01:14:31,941 --> 01:14:34,224
MATT: That'll do it.

1192
01:14:34,224 --> 01:14:35,164
LIAM: Okay.

1193
01:14:35,164 --> 01:14:38,657
MATT: You manage to, just in that moment of it
being struck with the two blade strikes from Lady

1194
01:14:38,657 --> 01:14:43,650
Kima, you manage to pull your head free from its
grasp. And just manage to right yourself now, the

1195
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:46,545
throbbing pain in your head of what you just
narrowly avoided still there.

1196
01:14:46,545 --> 01:14:52,663
LIAM: Okay. Poison dagger in hand, I roll an 18.
Does that hit?

1197
01:14:52,663 --> 01:14:57,317
MATT: Okay. 18. Currently that does hit, yes.

1198
01:14:57,317 --> 01:14:59,983
LIAM: I wanna grab him by the calamari and stab
him in the eye.

1199
01:14:59,983 --> 01:15:01,322
(laughter)

1200
01:15:01,322 --> 01:15:02,767
MATT: Okay, go for it.

1201
01:15:02,767 --> 01:15:07,693
LIAM: That's what I did, so-- and then if I'm five
feet-- if Kima's there, I can sneak attack

1202
01:15:07,693 --> 01:15:09,326
according to the rules?

1203
01:15:09,326 --> 01:15:10,293
MATT: Correct.

1204
01:15:10,293 --> 01:15:19,624
LIAM: All right, so I'm gonna stab him in the eye.
One. Plus the sneak attack damage is two, four,

1205
01:15:19,624 --> 01:15:27,690
ten, 13, 19, 38, plus seven-- 45.

1206
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:32,672
MATT: 45. All right. So, as you--

1207
01:15:32,672 --> 01:15:33,895
LIAM: With the poison dagger.

1208
01:15:33,895 --> 01:15:37,067
MATT: Right, the poison dagger. I think you've
already used the daily poison ability on this.

1209
01:15:37,067 --> 01:15:38,592
LIAM: I don't remember, so it's just a stab.

1210
01:15:38,592 --> 01:15:42,547
MATT: Okay. So the 45 points of damage. You pull
back and you jam it into the side of its eye. You

1211
01:15:42,547 --> 01:15:49,640
can see as it rears back, a spray of dark-colored
liquid kind of warms the side of your face. As you

1212
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:54,033
pull the blade back out it rears back and
(growls). You can hear its voice piercing into

1213
01:15:54,033 --> 01:15:58,253
your head going, "I will eat you one way or
another!"

1214
01:15:58,253 --> 01:15:59,853
ASHLEY: No, you won't!

1215
01:15:59,853 --> 01:16:03,025
LAURA: Did it distract him enough that we lost our
thingy?

1216
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:05,740
MATT: That's your main attack?

1217
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:09,897
LIAM: I mean, I would imagine between ungrappling
and stabbing, is that it for me? Or do I get my

1218
01:16:09,897 --> 01:16:10,974
second attack, I don't know?

1219
01:16:10,974 --> 01:16:12,188
MATT: You can get your second attack, I'm sorry.

1220
01:16:12,188 --> 01:16:19,058
LIAM: Okay, well I think, go fuck yourself, and
stab again. Nine plus-- 19.

1221
01:16:19,058 --> 01:16:21,642
MATT: 19? Yeah, that hits.

1222
01:16:21,642 --> 01:16:26,558
LIAM: Other eye, other eye. No sneak attack. Two
plus-- eight.

1223
01:16:26,558 --> 01:16:33,202
MATT: Eight. Okay. As it rears back and you hear
it saying that, you pull back and you grab with

1224
01:16:33,202 --> 01:16:38,407
your off hand the cluster of tentacles in the
front of its face and pull it down. As you do, the

1225
01:16:38,407 --> 01:16:43,664
inertia-- you jam the blade into the other eye. As
you do, you hear this blast burst of angry scream

1226
01:16:43,664 --> 01:16:49,068
inside your head, before it goes dead cold,
silent, and the mind flayer falls to the ground.

1227
01:16:49,068 --> 01:16:51,343
LIAM: I fucking hate these things!

1228
01:16:51,343 --> 01:17:02,312
MATT: All right. That brings us to Clarota, who's
currently stunned and fails save, Clarota's still

1229
01:17:02,312 --> 01:17:03,968
stunned. Tiberius.

1230
01:17:03,968 --> 01:17:06,582
ORION: I look through the door.

1231
01:17:06,582 --> 01:17:08,558
MATT: Look through the door.

1232
01:17:08,558 --> 01:17:12,819
ORION: What's going on in here? Are there any
enemies I can see?

1233
01:17:12,819 --> 01:17:17,145
MATT: You can see over here, barely. It's very
dark in the far corner, you can see just the shape

1234
01:17:17,145 --> 01:17:18,653
of some humanoid there.

1235
01:17:18,653 --> 01:17:25,808
ORION: Oh. Okay, is he-- (laughs)

1236
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:27,562
MATT: What are you doing, Tiberius?

1237
01:17:27,562 --> 01:17:29,465
ORION: (laughs) How tall is the thing?

1238
01:17:29,465 --> 01:17:34,256
MATT: From what you can see, it's maybe roughly
six, seven feet. Grog's blocking most of it.

1239
01:17:34,256 --> 01:17:36,395
ORION: No, like, we're in a bunker, right?

1240
01:17:36,395 --> 01:17:39,697
MATT: Right now, you're in this giant great hall
with giant tables and stools everywhere.

1241
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:41,053
ORION: And the ceiling is--

1242
01:17:41,053 --> 01:17:42,830
MATT: You can't see the ceiling right now, there's
no light.

1243
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:44,009
ORION: Oh.

1244
01:17:44,009 --> 01:17:47,766
MATT: The room is near pitch-black, like there's
just very little light in there currently.

1245
01:17:47,766 --> 01:17:51,160
ORION: I will waltz in behind Grog.

1246
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:52,258
MATT: All right.

1247
01:17:52,258 --> 01:17:57,408
ORION: I cast Light.

1248
01:17:57,408 --> 01:18:03,781
MATT: Okay. The room all of a sudden bursts into
view, you can now see the walls, the ceiling--

1249
01:18:03,781 --> 01:18:10,959
it's a smooth stone room. There is a large
chandelier currently hanging from the top of the

1250
01:18:10,959 --> 01:18:16,067
ceiling. It's about 25 feet up to the ceiling in
this current room.

1251
01:18:16,067 --> 01:18:18,141
MARISHA: (gasps) There's a big chandelier. That's
fun.

1252
01:18:18,141 --> 01:18:25,583
ORION: And now do I see that guy better?

1253
01:18:25,583 --> 01:18:28,695
MATT: You do, yes. You see now there is a mind
flayer currently ducking behind one of the tables

1254
01:18:28,695 --> 01:18:31,534
right now. You can see a number of your friends in
the party are currently clutching their heads,

1255
01:18:31,534 --> 01:18:33,870
silently screaming to themselves, unmoving.

1256
01:18:33,870 --> 01:18:38,193
ORION: Ah, right. There's another one of those
guys over there!

1257
01:18:38,193 --> 01:18:40,348
MARISHA: Wait, there's another one?

1258
01:18:40,348 --> 01:18:41,385
ORION: Yes!

1259
01:18:41,385 --> 01:18:42,310
MARISHA: There's two?

1260
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:43,352
MATT: There's two.

1261
01:18:43,352 --> 01:18:46,517
ORION: I spend three sorcerer points.

1262
01:18:46,517 --> 01:18:48,917
MATT: How many sorcerer points do you have left?
You spent a lot over the past couple games.

1263
01:18:48,917 --> 01:18:54,758
ORION: No, I have not, because I didn't do
anything last game, because I was all recharged.

1264
01:18:54,758 --> 01:18:58,702
MATT: That's true, actually. Okay. Just keep track
of that. So how many do you have left?

1265
01:18:58,702 --> 01:19:01,589
ORION: I have eight right now. Now I'll spend it
to go down to--

1266
01:19:01,589 --> 01:19:02,465
LAURA: Five.

1267
01:19:02,465 --> 01:19:03,878
ORION: Five. 'Cause math.

1268
01:19:03,878 --> 01:19:06,278
MATT: Okay, got you. Cool, good on you.

1269
01:19:06,278 --> 01:19:10,219
MARISHA: Fantasy math. Once again, 826LA,
after-school tutoring. Good charity.

1270
01:19:10,219 --> 01:19:16,863
ORION: I could have used it. I cast my pillars, or
Grand Columns, as I like to call it, and (piston

1271
01:19:16,863 --> 01:19:19,570
sound) all the way up and smash that little
bastard.

1272
01:19:19,570 --> 01:19:20,670
MATT: All right.

1273
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:22,009
MARISHA: Smashy smashy.

1274
01:19:22,009 --> 01:19:23,089
MATT: So what's the save you get past that for the
spell?

1275
01:19:23,089 --> 01:19:31,164
ORION: He does a dex save, and he takes 6d6
damage, and the dex save is to see if he's pinned

1276
01:19:31,164 --> 01:19:32,529
or not.

1277
01:19:32,529 --> 01:19:35,368
MATT: Right. It does make its save, I believe,
it's 21?

1278
01:19:35,368 --> 01:19:38,527
ORION: Oh, my, what?

1279
01:19:38,527 --> 01:19:45,351
MATT: Rolled a 21 versus your DC of your spell,
which I believe is not higher than 21.

1280
01:19:45,351 --> 01:19:46,273
ORION: No.

1281
01:19:46,273 --> 01:19:48,676
MATT: So yeah, so he still takes the damage, but
is not pinned.

1282
01:19:48,676 --> 01:19:54,924
ORION: Which is 15, 18 points of damage.

1283
01:19:54,924 --> 01:19:59,078
MATT: Okay, 18 points of damage, and manages to
pull out of the way just in time as it slams into

1284
01:19:59,078 --> 01:20:02,694
him, he darts off and catches himself on the
ground, kind of slowly levitating above the ground

1285
01:20:02,694 --> 01:20:08,721
as he comes to a stop. The pillar then slams into
the roof, this section here. Actually splinters

1286
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:18,016
part of the table, which is now kind of lifted
off-kilter at an angle. Yup. It--

1287
01:20:18,016 --> 01:20:23,601
ORION: Oh, so that-- does that mean he's in the
air for a whole round? 'Cause how it works is,

1288
01:20:23,601 --> 01:20:28,375
he's all the way up to that height, but he gets to
come, or fall, back down if he makes the save.

1289
01:20:28,375 --> 01:20:33,352
That's how-- so he has to travel that distance, so
does he cast Levitate as he's coming down?

1290
01:20:33,352 --> 01:20:36,890
MATT: How I'm playing it is, the impact of the
pillar suddenly slamming in from underneath is

1291
01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:40,903
what does the initial damage, and he manages to
roll off before it slams into the ceiling. He

1292
01:20:40,903 --> 01:20:46,196
kinda-- So. However, that ends your turn. The mind
flayer, now looking around and seeing the room lit

1293
01:20:46,196 --> 01:20:51,788
up, seeing the entire group now in this room,
looks around at everyone, puts its hands together

1294
01:20:51,788 --> 01:20:55,493
and concentrates-- and as it does you see its form
(sucking noise) vanish.

1295
01:20:55,493 --> 01:20:59,157
MARISHA: Damn it!

1296
01:20:59,157 --> 01:21:06,779
MATT: A few seconds pass, you guys manage to shrug
your stun, and Clarota as well.

1297
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:08,471
ASHLEY: Whoa, what happened?

1298
01:21:08,471 --> 01:21:09,738
MARISHA: That's not good.

1299
01:21:09,738 --> 01:21:10,779
LAURA: What happened?

1300
01:21:10,779 --> 01:21:12,583
MARISHA: They really know we're here.

1301
01:21:12,583 --> 01:21:14,864
LAURA: We need to get out of this room, then.

1302
01:21:14,864 --> 01:21:18,940
TALIESIN: Let's just search the rest of this floor
as quickly as possible.

1303
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,355
MARISHA: As quickly as possible.

1304
01:21:20,355 --> 01:21:27,499
LAURA: Grog, can you always put down the dust of
tracelessness?

1305
01:21:27,499 --> 01:21:33,982
MATT: "All right, I will." He's doing his
flower-girl moment. Passes behind you guys. All

1306
01:21:33,994 --> 01:21:36,271
right, so, what is the current mode of action for
you guys?

1307
01:21:36,271 --> 01:21:39,401
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and dart down this
hall that we know is for sure empty.

1308
01:21:39,401 --> 01:21:40,832
MATT: Okay.

1309
01:21:40,832 --> 01:21:43,229
LIAM: Exit the other side of the great hall that
we're in.

1310
01:21:43,229 --> 01:21:44,236
MATT: All right.

1311
01:21:44,236 --> 01:21:47,652
LAURA: And I think we should all go back-- we
should go to the second floor.

1312
01:21:47,652 --> 01:21:49,741
MATT: Through here.

1313
01:21:49,741 --> 01:21:51,346
LIAM: Walking in that door.

1314
01:21:51,346 --> 01:21:57,438
MATT: You look through here and see what appears
to be some sort of a kitchen. You can see shelf

1315
01:21:57,438 --> 01:22:01,392
units, you can see what looks like a few tables, you
can see some kitchen elements.

1316
01:22:01,485 --> 01:22:03,677
LIAM: I'm gonna walk all the way in, all the way
in.

1317
01:22:03,677 --> 01:22:06,188
MATT: All right, you walk all the way in. There's
a door towards the back--

1318
01:22:06,188 --> 01:22:08,225
LIAM: The right, what do I see?

1319
01:22:08,225 --> 01:22:11,314
MATT: The right, you see what looks to be a
doorway that's partially open that leads to a

1320
01:22:11,314 --> 01:22:12,354
staircase.

1321
01:22:12,354 --> 01:22:13,461
LIAM: Up or down?

1322
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:14,981
MATT: Looks like it's going up.

1323
01:22:14,981 --> 01:22:16,946
MARISHA: And what's in this room? I'm looking over
here.

1324
01:22:16,946 --> 01:22:19,691
MATT: Okay, you look over here. It's a double door
that is currently closed.

1325
01:22:19,691 --> 01:22:22,673
TALIESIN: I will head in your direction as well.

1326
01:22:22,673 --> 01:22:24,776
ORION: Eight, two of my d6s to heal up.

1327
01:22:24,776 --> 01:22:30,948
MATT: You haven't taken a short rest yet. You have
to-- you guys have to stop and take ten minutes,

1328
01:22:30,948 --> 01:22:33,148
15 minutes to rest to do that, so--

1329
01:22:33,148 --> 01:22:38,846
SAM: I'm gonna look all over the great hall and
see if there's any cool stuff in there.

1330
01:22:38,846 --> 01:22:41,078
MATT: Make a perception check.

1331
01:22:41,078 --> 01:22:43,524
LAURA: I think what we should do-- Everyone, I
think what we should do is make our way back to

1332
01:22:43,524 --> 01:22:48,553
the initial storage room we were in and go up that
stairway, because that one's hidden. It's by a

1333
01:22:48,553 --> 01:22:53,276
hidden entrance, people aren't gonna think about
that one as much as main stairways.

1334
01:22:53,276 --> 01:22:56,880
TALIESIN: I agree, I think we should-- I agree
with that, I just think we should check the rest

1335
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:01,443
of the floor as well. Just double-check
everything, make sure we didn't miss the--

1336
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:03,251
LIAM: Vax is heading back to the group.

1337
01:23:03,251 --> 01:23:04,534
MATT: Okay.

1338
01:23:04,534 --> 01:23:08,865
MARISHA: Percy and I are checking this room with
the double doors. Do you have any trap checks to

1339
01:23:08,865 --> 01:23:10,096
see if it's locked?

1340
01:23:10,096 --> 01:23:11,364
LIAM: I do!

1341
01:23:11,364 --> 01:23:15,909
MATT: Okay, so Percy and both you guys open this
doorway. It opens up into what looks to be another

1342
01:23:15,909 --> 01:23:21,542
smaller eating hall. This one's nicer, this one
has one long table. This is probably where the

1343
01:23:21,542 --> 01:23:25,821
more socially risen--

1344
01:23:25,821 --> 01:23:27,563
TALIESIN: Take a quick look around.

1345
01:23:27,563 --> 01:23:29,183
MARISHA: Yeah, anything in there?

1346
01:23:29,183 --> 01:23:31,849
MATT: Looks like it hasn't been used for a day or
two.

1347
01:23:31,849 --> 01:23:32,807
TALIESIN: All right.

1348
01:23:32,807 --> 01:23:34,053
MARISHA: No cool goodies?

1349
01:23:34,053 --> 01:23:35,628
MATT: No current goodies in this area, no.

1350
01:23:35,628 --> 01:23:39,878
TALIESIN: So we'll go-- just keep going down and
check the rest of that hallway.

1351
01:23:39,878 --> 01:23:41,217
MATT: Okay.

1352
01:23:41,217 --> 01:23:47,280
LAURA: There's a lot more, you guys. I think we
should go find the vault on the second floor.

1353
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:56,752
MATT: All right, you guys press down here. There
apparently are now-- you can see there's another

1354
01:23:56,752 --> 01:23:58,184
set of double doors--

1355
01:23:58,184 --> 01:23:59,556
LIAM: Vax is following.

1356
01:23:59,556 --> 01:24:00,631
MATT: All right.

1357
01:24:00,631 --> 01:24:05,509
LAURA: I think I should gather the group and try
to make it back to the other storage room. Just to

1358
01:24:05,509 --> 01:24:07,456
get us out of this area specifically.

1359
01:24:07,456 --> 01:24:08,999
MATT: So you guys are all moving back with--

1360
01:24:08,999 --> 01:24:09,865
LAURA: Is that cool?

1361
01:24:09,865 --> 01:24:11,464
MATT: -- Vex to return to the previous storage
room?

1362
01:24:11,464 --> 01:24:13,090
MARISHA: We can do that. Yeah, go for it.

1363
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:17,902
TALIESIN: And you'll hear us if anything goes
wrong. Yeah, we'll power through it.

1364
01:24:17,902 --> 01:24:19,279
LAURA: Use your earring.

1365
01:24:19,279 --> 01:24:20,406
MATT: All right.

1366
01:24:20,406 --> 01:24:26,634
MARISHA: I'll go ahead and very-- I'm just gonna
kinda use my keen sense-- or sorry, my keen smell

1367
01:24:26,634 --> 01:24:29,232
again to see if I can smell any duergar in the
area.

1368
01:24:29,232 --> 01:24:32,842
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a perception check
with advantage.

1369
01:24:32,842 --> 01:24:38,797
MARISHA: That's pretty good. Oh yeah, I'll take
that first roll, which was seven-- 27.

1370
01:24:38,797 --> 01:24:47,007
MATT: 27. You smell that on this floor, there
doesn't appear to be any duergar in your immediate

1371
01:24:47,007 --> 01:24:51,483
vicinity. There is a strong, lingering scent of
them coming from the doorway

1372
01:24:51,483 --> 01:24:52,944
that you're currently at.

1373
01:24:52,944 --> 01:24:55,299
MARISHA: A strong, lingering scent?

1374
01:24:55,299 --> 01:24:59,265
MATT: Correct, like it-- you can kind of tell
there was a recent moving of a large number of

1375
01:24:59,265 --> 01:25:00,148
duergar.

1376
01:25:00,148 --> 01:25:01,579
MARISHA: But probably not present.

1377
01:25:01,579 --> 01:25:02,837
MATT: You don't know.

1378
01:25:02,837 --> 01:25:04,732
MARISHA: Whatever. I guess we'll see what's in
here.

1379
01:25:04,732 --> 01:25:06,223
MATT: All righty.

1380
01:25:06,223 --> 01:25:07,403
MARISHA: Peeky, peeky.

1381
01:25:07,403 --> 01:25:09,391
LIAM: I kind of parkour past Percy.

1382
01:25:09,391 --> 01:25:10,421
MATT: Okay.

1383
01:25:10,421 --> 01:25:11,914
ORION: Parkour past Percy!

1384
01:25:11,914 --> 01:25:13,191
MARISHA: Parkour, parkour!

1385
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:19,795
MATT: You open the doors into what appears to be a
large temple chamber, a place of worship. What you

1386
01:25:19,795 --> 01:25:24,654
see are a series of long, wooden benches that are
arranged to look towards the center. There is an

1387
01:25:24,654 --> 01:25:30,779
altar to the right that is a risen kind of stone
dais, and in the center there is a stone table, an

1388
01:25:30,779 --> 01:25:34,953
altar which has a piece of black cloth wrapped
over it and something on top of it you can't see

1389
01:25:34,953 --> 01:25:38,996
from this distance. In the center of the room
there is a 12-foot-tall statue of what looks like

1390
01:25:38,996 --> 01:25:43,900
an extremely strong armored duergar clutching a
giant warhammer and a shield.

1391
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:46,949
MARISHA: Hm. I'm gonna-- oh wait, I'm a tiger.

1392
01:25:46,949 --> 01:25:48,341
MATT: Yup.

1393
01:25:48,341 --> 01:25:52,274
LIAM: I'm gonna perception check the room. Which
is high. 27.

1394
01:25:52,274 --> 01:25:55,211
MATT: 27? There does not appear to be anybody
inside this room.

1395
01:25:55,211 --> 01:25:56,332
LIAM: Screw this room.

1396
01:25:56,332 --> 01:25:57,526
MATT: However, do you have a religion--

1397
01:25:57,526 --> 01:25:59,172
TALIESIN: I would like to do a religion roll.

1398
01:25:59,172 --> 01:26:01,141
MATT: Roll religion, guys.

1399
01:26:01,141 --> 01:26:02,309
TALIESIN: Nine.

1400
01:26:02,309 --> 01:26:03,796
LIAM: Nine.

1401
01:26:03,796 --> 01:26:05,667
ASHLEY: Could I do a religion roll from where I
am?

1402
01:26:05,667 --> 01:26:06,998
MATT: You are not over there, unfortunately.

1403
01:26:06,998 --> 01:26:10,591
MARISHA: That's what I was gonna do, is tell
somebody to get Pike over here real quick.

1404
01:26:10,591 --> 01:26:11,996
LAURA: Do you guys have earrings?

1405
01:26:11,996 --> 01:26:14,991
ASHLEY: I can put on my sprinter's boots.

1406
01:26:14,991 --> 01:26:19,291
LIAM: Yeah, Pike, Pike? There's some sort of
religious artifacts over here. Could use your

1407
01:26:19,291 --> 01:26:20,270
expertise.

1408
01:26:20,270 --> 01:26:22,938
MATT: Pike, you make your way through, eventually
coming down this hallway--

1409
01:26:23,064 --> 01:26:26,955
(clanking)

1410
01:26:27,012 --> 01:26:29,410
MARISHA: She's coming! I can hear her coming.

1411
01:26:29,468 --> 01:26:32,014
ASHLEY: Hey guys, I'm here! Did you know I was
coming?

1412
01:26:32,014 --> 01:26:33,342
(laughter)

1413
01:26:33,342 --> 01:26:34,632
MATT: Go ahead and make a religion check.

1414
01:26:34,632 --> 01:26:36,054
LIAM: Don't stab anything.

1415
01:26:36,054 --> 01:26:39,698
ORION: I'm gonna follow suit, but slowly.

1416
01:26:39,698 --> 01:26:40,805
ASHLEY: 17.

1417
01:26:40,805 --> 01:26:50,341
MATT: All right. As you're heading that direction
slowly, best that you can tell right now, this

1418
01:26:50,341 --> 01:26:55,966
room is definitely a small temple built to-- and
the name kind of escapes you, the words trying to

1419
01:26:55,966 --> 01:26:59,709
form in your head for a second, and then
eventually you come to realize this is a chapel to

1420
01:26:59,709 --> 01:27:05,383
Laduguer. Laduguer is the deity of the duergar.
It's the god that basically freed them from their

1421
01:27:05,383 --> 01:27:10,516
original enslavement from the illithids, and they
worship as a pinnacle of power,

1422
01:27:10,516 --> 01:27:12,125
strength, and conquest.

1423
01:27:12,125 --> 01:27:17,212
ORION: I make it up to where those guys are.

1424
01:27:17,212 --> 01:27:18,217
MATT: All right.

1425
01:27:18,217 --> 01:27:19,543
TALIESIN: Let's keep searching.

1426
01:27:19,543 --> 01:27:26,982
SAM: Hey, what's the darkness right next to me? Is
there a door there? What is that?

1427
01:27:26,982 --> 01:27:29,064
MATT: There is a door right over here.

1428
01:27:29,064 --> 01:27:30,672
SAM: Oh. I'm gonna open it.

1429
01:27:30,672 --> 01:27:36,409
MATT: Okay. All right. So you go ahead and open
the door. It opens up into what you can

1430
01:27:36,409 --> 01:27:45,351
immediately see is a chamber that is some kind of
magical laboratory. You see in the far corner,

1431
01:27:45,351 --> 01:27:54,552
hunched, a robed duergar, and as you open the
door, there's a slight sound, a click sound, and a

1432
01:27:54,552 --> 01:28:00,241
jet of greenish fume begins to spray up into your
face. Make a constitution save.

1433
01:28:00,241 --> 01:28:06,167
SAM: Oh, god. I don't even know what that is!
(laughs) 15.

1434
01:28:06,167 --> 01:28:08,915
MATT: 15? All right.

1435
01:28:08,915 --> 01:28:17,726
So you take 11 points of poison damage.
However, you can feel the poison forcing its way

1436
01:28:17,726 --> 01:28:21,096
into your lungs. You manage to back out of the
cloud in time and cough it up and your general

1437
01:28:21,096 --> 01:28:25,318
physical well-being-- you resist most of the
effects of the poison. However, this poison fume

1438
01:28:25,318 --> 01:28:30,804
trap did appear to go off and as the smoke slowly
dissipates, you hear a chuckle

1439
01:28:30,804 --> 01:28:32,310
across the other side.

1440
01:28:32,310 --> 01:28:34,414
ORION: As I hear the noise, I--

1441
01:28:34,414 --> 01:28:36,900
MATT: You don't hear the noise, you're too far
away.

1442
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:38,272
ORION: Oh, shit.

1443
01:28:38,272 --> 01:28:40,107
MATT: You guys do hear it, though.

1444
01:28:40,107 --> 01:28:42,851
LAURA: Okay, I come over there and see what the--
what just happened.

1445
01:28:42,851 --> 01:28:48,439
MATT: Okay, as you rush over, Scanlan's backed up
away and you can see there's this chamber here.

1446
01:28:48,439 --> 01:28:50,374
LAURA: Is the poison still in the air, or is it--

1447
01:28:50,374 --> 01:28:52,947
MATT: It's dissipated at this point. It's thin
enough. You still can smell it, and it smells

1448
01:28:52,947 --> 01:28:56,301
awful, like a very, very heavy, electrical
fire-type smell.

1449
01:28:56,301 --> 01:28:57,580
LAURA: So I can see that guy?

1450
01:28:57,580 --> 01:28:58,666
MATT: Yeah.

1451
01:28:58,666 --> 01:29:02,544
LAURA: So should I notch an arrow and try to hit
him?

1452
01:29:02,544 --> 01:29:03,892
MATT: It's up to you. What're you going to do?

1453
01:29:03,892 --> 01:29:05,073
LAURA: All right, I attack him, then!

1454
01:29:05,073 --> 01:29:06,254
MATT: All right, go for it then.

1455
01:29:06,254 --> 01:29:07,903
ASHLEY: Attack him! Get him!

1456
01:29:07,903 --> 01:29:13,337
LAURA: Shabang! Oh, dang it, I didn't do it. I
meant to Hunter's Mark him and transfer it over,

1457
01:29:13,337 --> 01:29:14,720
but that's okay, I didn't say it.

1458
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:15,972
MATT: You didn't say it this time.

1459
01:29:15,972 --> 01:29:18,145
LAURA: That's 30. For the first.

1460
01:29:18,145 --> 01:29:19,466
LIAM: You did say shabang.

1461
01:29:19,466 --> 01:29:21,119
LAURA: I did say shabang, and 16 for the second.

1462
01:29:21,119 --> 01:29:24,003
MATT: Okay, both hit. Go ahead and roll damage on
each.

1463
01:29:24,003 --> 01:29:25,779
ASHLEY: Hit it.

1464
01:29:25,779 --> 01:29:28,199
(music flares up)

1465
01:29:28,199 --> 01:29:31,300
LAURA: Well, sort of. 15 and eight.

1466
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:33,443
MATT: 15 and eight. All right.

1467
01:29:33,443 --> 01:29:35,799
LIAM: The music is on.

1468
01:29:35,860 --> 01:29:40,843
MATT: All right. So both arrows you've been firing
over the top. He's kind of hard to see with the

1469
01:29:40,843 --> 01:29:43,905
table and from being crouched in the corner, but
both arrows still manage to barely make their

1470
01:29:43,905 --> 01:29:48,557
mark. One kind of pins him against the wall, and
he looks at his shoulder briefly, looks back at

1471
01:29:48,557 --> 01:29:51,993
you, raises his hand, as he begins muttering
something under his breath. As he does, your arrow

1472
01:29:51,993 --> 01:29:56,941
(shnk) through his hand and he tries to shake it,
and now he's pinned to the wall with an arrow in

1473
01:29:57,001 --> 01:29:58,190
the middle of his hand.

1474
01:29:58,190 --> 01:29:59,386
LAURA and ASHLEY: Yeah!

1475
01:29:59,386 --> 01:30:00,988
LAURA: Trinket! Oh no, I used two attacks.

1476
01:30:00,988 --> 01:30:01,868
MATT: Yeah.

1477
01:30:01,868 --> 01:30:02,887
LAURA: Dang it.

1478
01:30:02,887 --> 01:30:08,436
MATT: You can still tell Trinket to move. What are
you gonna do?

1479
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:12,498
LAURA: No, no no, I'm gonna hold him there, 'cause
he's already in the room.

1480
01:30:12,498 --> 01:30:16,440
MATT: Okay, got you. All right, so what are you
guys doing over in the temple?

1481
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:18,458
LIAM: Exiting.

1482
01:30:18,458 --> 01:30:19,638
MATT: All right.

1483
01:30:19,638 --> 01:30:23,009
MARISHA: No! Look and see if there's anything
cool, first. What was that thing that's covered up

1484
01:30:23,009 --> 01:30:24,872
by the blanket on the altar?

1485
01:30:24,872 --> 01:30:26,774
MATT: You keep walking towards it?

1486
01:30:26,774 --> 01:30:28,916
MARISHA: Yeah. What's up with that?

1487
01:30:28,916 --> 01:30:31,884
MATT: You make your way, you look at the top of
the dais where the altar is, and on top you can

1488
01:30:31,884 --> 01:30:37,888
see the black cloth that is wrapped over it. The
scent gets to you before the actual visual. It's

1489
01:30:37,888 --> 01:30:45,950
freshly rotting flesh of some kind, and as you
glance over, you can see there is a heart that has

1490
01:30:45,950 --> 01:30:49,886
been cut from a body and it's at the point where
the blood has coagulated and begin to become

1491
01:30:49,886 --> 01:30:53,000
thick. It's roughly dwarven size.

1492
01:30:53,206 --> 01:30:58,856
MARISHA: I get up and I grab it in my mouth.

1493
01:30:58,856 --> 01:31:00,697
MATT: Okay. It tastes disgusting.

1494
01:31:00,697 --> 01:31:07,133
MARISHA: And then I walk over to Vax and I lay it
at his feet. I kind of nudge it with my nose.

1495
01:31:07,133 --> 01:31:09,434
MATT: She got you a heart.

1496
01:31:09,434 --> 01:31:15,249
LIAM: I scritch Keyleth behind the ear, but nudge
it aside with my toe and exit the room.

1497
01:31:15,249 --> 01:31:16,618
MATT: Okay.

1498
01:31:16,618 --> 01:31:22,559
LIAM: I did scritch her ears, but I'm going to
continue down to the end of the hall.

1499
01:31:22,559 --> 01:31:25,490
MATT: This way?

1500
01:31:25,490 --> 01:31:26,701
LIAM: Yeah.

1501
01:31:26,701 --> 01:31:30,452
MATT: Okay, you make your way into what looks like
a giant foyer, into a secondary entrance in the

1502
01:31:30,452 --> 01:31:32,090
side of the fortress.

1503
01:31:32,090 --> 01:31:33,909
LIAM: I just walk all the way over to the corner,
stealthing.

1504
01:31:33,909 --> 01:31:35,406
MATT: Make a stealth check.

1505
01:31:35,406 --> 01:31:37,640
LIAM: It's high, it's 28.

1506
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:42,949
MATT: 28, got it, okay. So, as you make your way
through, you eventually careen to this corner. You

1507
01:31:42,949 --> 01:31:46,982
can see another hallway, what appears to be
another room of some kind. You also glance back

1508
01:31:46,982 --> 01:31:49,824
and see there are two sets of stairways that go up
and down.

1509
01:31:49,824 --> 01:31:51,094
LIAM: What's behind me?

1510
01:31:51,094 --> 01:31:53,487
MATT: This is a giant foyer that leads outside of
the fortress.

1511
01:31:53,487 --> 01:31:54,893
LIAM: And the edge of the map this way?

1512
01:31:54,893 --> 01:32:00,940
MATT: This way here? This way? This comes to an
abrupt end at that point, a rocky wall into the

1513
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:03,292
mountain itself that it's buttressed up against.

1514
01:32:03,292 --> 01:32:05,961
LIAM: Okay, I'm gonna keep coming this way,
stealthing.

1515
01:32:05,961 --> 01:32:08,995
MATT: All right. As you move through--

1516
01:32:08,995 --> 01:32:13,249
LAURA: What's happening with that dude I-- are you
doing all this while I just pin down--

1517
01:32:13,249 --> 01:32:15,441
LIAM: Yeah. I don't know what's going on back
there. I'm just walking around.

1518
01:32:15,441 --> 01:32:21,769
MATT: So, you glance in this room. There's an open
walkway and what appears to be another barrack

1519
01:32:21,769 --> 01:32:23,513
section, also completely empty.

1520
01:32:23,513 --> 01:32:27,996
LIAM: Screw that. Do I see a door for this room
that's still darkened out? Then I'm gonna

1521
01:32:27,996 --> 01:32:29,528
keep sliding along the wall.

1522
01:32:29,528 --> 01:32:35,220
MATT: Okay, as you slide along here, to make your
way around to a door there.

1523
01:32:35,282 --> 01:32:38,608
LIAM: Okay. Pressing my hand, just to see if I can
check any for traps.

1524
01:32:38,608 --> 01:32:39,874
MATT: Okay.

1525
01:32:39,874 --> 01:32:43,005
LIAM: 26.

1526
01:32:43,005 --> 01:32:46,054
MATT: 26, all right. The door does not appear to
be trapped.

1527
01:32:46,054 --> 01:32:48,041
TALIESIN: I'm gonna be heading in that direction
anyway.

1528
01:32:48,041 --> 01:32:49,343
MARISHA: Agreed. Same here.

1529
01:32:49,343 --> 01:32:50,257
MATT: Okay.

1530
01:32:50,257 --> 01:32:52,289
LIAM: I would like to stealth through the door.

1531
01:32:52,289 --> 01:32:57,074
ORION: Before I leave, I carefully examine that
statue.

1532
01:32:57,074 --> 01:33:00,774
MATT: Okay, what are you examining?

1533
01:33:00,774 --> 01:33:05,592
ORION: The facial features of the god, the deity,
right? Is that what he is?

1534
01:33:05,592 --> 01:33:10,093
MATT: Yeah. Okay, so you look at the face of
Laduguer. You can see it's very, very old, it's

1535
01:33:10,093 --> 01:33:15,145
very well-crafted. You can see a lot of very
meticulous craftsmanship went into its creation.

1536
01:33:15,145 --> 01:33:23,479
It almost glistens with a perfection that is out
of place in an area that is so covered in soot and

1537
01:33:23,479 --> 01:33:27,417
various other volcanic activity-based mineral
deposits.

1538
01:33:27,417 --> 01:33:33,968
ORION: I'm gonna do a quick arcana check, just to
see if there's any kind of mystical thing around

1539
01:33:33,968 --> 01:33:36,507
it or anything like that. And it's 19.

1540
01:33:36,507 --> 01:33:42,429
MATT: Okay. There is some sort of a hum to the air
that has an arcane element to it, but you are

1541
01:33:42,429 --> 01:33:45,555
unable to pinpoint what it necessarily means or
what the source is.

1542
01:33:45,555 --> 01:33:49,997
ORION: Interesting. Knowing that, I kind of gather
my thoughts and I head towards where the rest of

1543
01:33:49,997 --> 01:33:51,041
the group is.

1544
01:33:51,041 --> 01:33:56,483
MATT: Okay, so, while you're opening the door, the
mage in the far corner kind of looks about

1545
01:33:56,483 --> 01:34:04,143
sporadically and looks down at the arrow in its
hand and its shoulder and just kind of fearfully,

1546
01:34:04,143 --> 01:34:10,643
"Wait wait wait! Wait. Stop. Don't attack. Let's
have a conversation."

1547
01:34:10,643 --> 01:34:13,705
LAURA: Speak fast. Before I kill you.

1548
01:34:13,705 --> 01:34:18,989
MATT: He leans forward, kind of pulling the arrow
out of the doorway. (groans in pain) Starts

1549
01:34:18,989 --> 01:34:20,487
hobbling towards you a little bit.

1550
01:34:20,487 --> 01:34:23,333
LAURA: Can we all-- we go in the room and Trinket
goes up next to him and, like,

1551
01:34:23,333 --> 01:34:24,833
gets all up in his face?

1552
01:34:24,833 --> 01:34:31,057
MATT: Okay. As you both enter, both of you make
constitution saving throws. As two more plumes of

1553
01:34:31,057 --> 01:34:34,137
poison (pff) out of the ground as both you and
Trinket walk in.

1554
01:34:34,137 --> 01:34:36,114
LIAM: Good.

1555
01:34:36,114 --> 01:34:37,717
LAURA: 15?

1556
01:34:37,717 --> 01:34:39,534
MATT: 15, okay. And for Trinket as well.

1557
01:34:39,534 --> 01:34:46,055
LAURA: Oh, I should've been so smart, but I
wasn't.

1558
01:34:46,055 --> 01:34:50,397
(laughter)

1559
01:34:50,397 --> 01:34:53,326
LAURA: 14 for Trinket.

1560
01:34:53,326 --> 01:34:55,883
MATT: Okay. You take seven points of poison
damage.

1561
01:34:55,883 --> 01:34:57,153
LAURA: Okay.

1562
01:34:57,153 --> 01:35:00,210
MATT: Trinket, however, takes 14 points of poison
damage.

1563
01:35:00,210 --> 01:35:01,935
LAURA: Oh man. What did I get, seven?

1564
01:35:01,935 --> 01:35:04,882
MATT: Seven. And Trinket is currently considered
poisoned.

1565
01:35:04,882 --> 01:35:06,182
LAURA: Oh no!

1566
01:35:06,182 --> 01:35:07,634
SAM: What does that mean?

1567
01:35:07,634 --> 01:35:11,193
MATT: It means disadvantage on attack rolls,
disadvantage on ability checks.

1568
01:35:11,193 --> 01:35:12,591
LAURA: That's okay.

1569
01:35:12,591 --> 01:35:17,644
MATT: And now there's a bear coughing and kind of
thrashing about the room. The table it bumps into

1570
01:35:17,644 --> 01:35:19,181
and it kind of topples over.

1571
01:35:19,181 --> 01:35:21,995
LAURA: Is this like a turn thing or can I do
something?

1572
01:35:21,995 --> 01:35:25,887
MATT: Well, this is just a reactionary moment of
you guys coughing and trying to get out of this

1573
01:35:25,887 --> 01:35:26,889
poisonous fume.

1574
01:35:26,889 --> 01:35:29,851
LAURA: I mean, can I quickly cast Protection from
Poison on Trinket?

1575
01:35:29,851 --> 01:35:30,807
MATT: You can, yes.

1576
01:35:30,807 --> 01:35:31,886
LAURA: Okay. I do that.

1577
01:35:31,886 --> 01:35:32,880
MATT: Okay.

1578
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,164
LAURA: And that cures it.

1579
01:35:34,164 --> 01:35:35,862
MATT: That completely removes the poison?

1580
01:35:35,862 --> 01:35:36,963
LAURA: Yes it does.

1581
01:35:36,963 --> 01:35:37,721
MATT: Okay.

1582
01:35:37,721 --> 01:35:38,676
LAURA: Yay Trinket!

1583
01:35:38,676 --> 01:35:42,423
MATT: Well done. So that's your action. You now,
as you are checking the door and you open it up,

1584
01:35:42,423 --> 01:35:46,576
you hear all this commotion going off to the side
now. Scanlan, you're over there as well, watching

1585
01:35:46,576 --> 01:35:49,723
as more plumes of these poisonous smoke bits.

1586
01:35:49,723 --> 01:35:53,012
SAM: If I get close to the door without going
through it, can I see the guy?

1587
01:35:53,012 --> 01:35:59,632
MATT: You can move over and look, you can just
barely make out his form. It is a dark room that

1588
01:35:59,632 --> 01:36:03,582
is currently filled with a slowly dissipating
green cloud so it's hard to make him out.

1589
01:36:03,582 --> 01:36:12,096
SAM: Okay, well then I will just-- fuck (laughs).
Well, if I can't see him

1590
01:36:12,096 --> 01:36:14,083
then I will just yell at him.

1591
01:36:14,083 --> 01:36:15,023
MATT: All right.

1592
01:36:15,023 --> 01:36:20,434
SAM: I'll yell with Vicious Mockery. I don't like
you very much for poisoning me and my friends,

1593
01:36:20,434 --> 01:36:22,341
you're a poopy head!

1594
01:36:22,341 --> 01:36:24,093
(laughter)

1595
01:36:24,093 --> 01:36:25,067
MARISHA: So vicious.

1596
01:36:25,067 --> 01:36:26,330
LAURA: That is threatening.

1597
01:36:26,330 --> 01:36:29,240
MARISHA: Damn.

1598
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:33,003
SAM: Ooh. That does seven points of damage.

1599
01:36:33,003 --> 01:36:37,674
MATT: Seven points from Vicious Mockery? All
right!

1600
01:36:37,674 --> 01:36:40,012
(laughter)

1601
01:36:40,012 --> 01:36:41,743
MATT: I don't know how that works.

1602
01:36:41,743 --> 01:36:43,640
SAM: It's Vicious Mockery. It's an attack.

1603
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:44,802
MATT: That's crazy.

1604
01:36:44,802 --> 01:36:47,675
LIAM: That's, like, 80 points of damage!

1605
01:36:47,675 --> 01:36:51,717
MARISHA: And who said that words couldn't hurt
people?

1606
01:36:51,717 --> 01:36:54,105
TALIESIN: And bonus damage to his mother, wherever
she may be.

1607
01:36:54,105 --> 01:36:58,257
MARISHA: Sticks and stones can break my bones, but
words can hurt.

1608
01:36:58,257 --> 01:37:02,091
MATT: Okay. So it has to make a will saving throw,
against your DC. It rolls a three. It does not.

1609
01:37:02,091 --> 01:37:08,629
So, as you shout out into this room, the currently
fearful duergar mage kind of glances, eyes slide

1610
01:37:08,629 --> 01:37:12,960
about, hears these words and you see him wrack his
head for a second with a sudden sense of

1611
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,566
self-loathing and disappointment.

1612
01:37:15,566 --> 01:37:18,571
(laughter)

1613
01:37:18,571 --> 01:37:23,465
MATT: His hands drop and it looks like for a
minute his intent to begin muttering some sort of

1614
01:37:23,465 --> 01:37:25,758
incantation is momentarily distracted.

1615
01:37:25,758 --> 01:37:27,148
ORION: Nice!

1616
01:37:27,148 --> 01:37:29,283
MATT: All right, awesome.

1617
01:37:29,283 --> 01:37:30,465
ASHLEY: Can I start moving back?

1618
01:37:30,465 --> 01:37:32,924
MATT: Yeah, you can start moving back this way.

1619
01:37:32,924 --> 01:37:36,483
LIAM: I hear that, but I'm still going to poke my
head stealthily through the door and see what I

1620
01:37:36,483 --> 01:37:38,547
see. Do I need a new stealth check or?

1621
01:37:38,547 --> 01:37:39,756
MATT: Yes you do.

1622
01:37:39,756 --> 01:37:47,270
LIAM: Okay, great. So that is a 32.

1623
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:51,630
MATT: All right, you glance inside at what looks
to be some sort of a training room. There are--

1624
01:37:51,630 --> 01:37:55,928
most of the floor itself is stone, and in the far
corner there is a large section that is mainly

1625
01:37:55,928 --> 01:38:01,216
just sand and dirt and there are a number of
wooden training structures. You know, various

1626
01:38:01,216 --> 01:38:06,239
shields and wooden bars that are used as a means
of training for weaponry. There's what looks like

1627
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:08,721
a giant rack of weapons, full of arms and stuff.

1628
01:38:08,721 --> 01:38:10,634
LIAM: Anything good-looking?

1629
01:38:10,634 --> 01:38:14,119
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

1630
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:15,284
LIAM: One.

1631
01:38:15,284 --> 01:38:18,299
MATT: Most of the materials in this room look like
the basic duergar fare.

1632
01:38:18,299 --> 01:38:19,924
LIAM: These don't look very good.

1633
01:38:19,924 --> 01:38:22,337
TALIESIN: I was going to run in and take a look
around anyway so--

1634
01:38:22,337 --> 01:38:31,114
MATT: (laughs) Okay. As you run in, go ahead and
make a dexterity saving throw.

1635
01:38:31,114 --> 01:38:33,500
TALIESIN: God damn it. Okay.

1636
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:36,360
SAM: (sings) Traps, traps, traps-traps-traps.

1637
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:37,631
TALIESIN: 24.

1638
01:38:37,631 --> 01:38:46,184
MATT: All right, so. You take ten points of
lightning damage as you feel a tile on the ground

1639
01:38:46,184 --> 01:38:52,266
trigger and then spring up, and as it does, you
hear this sudden high-pitched whine as blue energy

1640
01:38:52,266 --> 01:38:57,477
streaks up from the floor, runs through your body.
Thankfully, you manage to dive out of the way and

1641
01:38:57,477 --> 01:39:03,145
touch the ground to ground the energy, minimizing
the damage. But yeah, you triggered (laughs)

1642
01:39:03,145 --> 01:39:08,222
triggered a trap plate. You're beginning to get
the sense that a lot of this tactic of this

1643
01:39:08,222 --> 01:39:12,099
fortress now has been to lead you guys through
a--

1644
01:39:12,099 --> 01:39:14,050
MARISHA: Maze?

1645
01:39:14,050 --> 01:39:15,524
MATT: A maze of traps.

1646
01:39:15,524 --> 01:39:16,864
SAM: A labyrinth.

1647
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:19,828
LIAM: Before we hurt ourselves any longer, we
should--

1648
01:39:19,828 --> 01:39:24,643
LAURA: We've got to kill this guy. Or talk to him
at least.

1649
01:39:24,643 --> 01:39:27,171
LIAM: We need to get to the main event here.

1650
01:39:27,171 --> 01:39:35,455
MATT: All right. At this point, Kima is now-- As
Kima hears you shouting all these curses into the

1651
01:39:35,455 --> 01:39:41,029
room, Kima pushes past you, and pushes past you.
You can see Kima coming into the room behind you

1652
01:39:41,029 --> 01:39:47,518
guys. Steps over the broken table, down in front
of the circle, and grabs the mage by the front of

1653
01:39:47,518 --> 01:39:52,455
his robe, pulling him into her face. The mage at
this point is still kind of reeling from the fact

1654
01:39:52,455 --> 01:39:55,112
that you managed to strike him so deeply in the
heart of his hearts.

1655
01:39:55,112 --> 01:39:57,003
SAM: He's just not a nice man.

1656
01:39:57,003 --> 01:40:02,430
MATT: However, Kima, with a look of absolute death
in her face, grabs him and pulls him forward and

1657
01:40:02,430 --> 01:40:07,425
says, "Listen, where is the rest of your fucking
army?"

1658
01:40:07,484 --> 01:40:09,994
She's going to make an intimidation check.

1659
01:40:10,036 --> 01:40:11,648
TALIESIN: Yeah! Damn.

1660
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:14,901
MATT: He does not succeed in resisting that.

1661
01:40:14,901 --> 01:40:15,959
LAURA: Yes!

1662
01:40:15,959 --> 01:40:19,225
MATT: The duergar is pressed against the wall now,
and she's slamming him against the back of a

1663
01:40:19,225 --> 01:40:26,998
bookshelf. "Look, all right, they're
waiting for you up there, all right? You're not

1664
01:40:27,043 --> 01:40:31,041
"going to survive this. At this point, the entire
city's probably waiting for you in the outside of

1665
01:40:31,041 --> 01:40:36,208
"the fortress and those that are upstairs are
well-prepared. Okay? Your best chance of survival

1666
01:40:36,208 --> 01:40:42,800
"is laying down your arms and surrendering. I'm
looking out for your best interests here."

1667
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,192
LIAM: Kill this asshole.

1668
01:40:44,192 --> 01:40:45,489
MARISHA: Kill him.

1669
01:40:45,489 --> 01:40:49,562
MATT: Kima, who is still holding him against
there, you can see her hand releases the scruff

1670
01:40:49,562 --> 01:40:54,964
and he takes a deep breath for a second. But
before he can finish exhaling, she goes in,

1671
01:40:54,964 --> 01:40:59,168
immediately grabbing his throat and squeezing it
extremely tight. As she does, you see his tongue,

1672
01:40:59,176 --> 01:41:02,691
dangling out the side of his mouth (strangling
noises) as she's cutting off his entire air

1673
01:41:02,691 --> 01:41:09,235
supply. She pulls forward and takes the greatsword
and begins to slowly push it into his abdomen. As

1674
01:41:09,235 --> 01:41:13,347
she does, he starts screaming in terrible pain.
You can see her just slowly pushing the blade

1675
01:41:13,347 --> 01:41:19,840
through his body into the bookcase behind. As she
does, she goes, "You're gonna tell me, right now,

1676
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:25,883
"who they have waiting for us upstairs." As she
begins to push all the way to the hilt now, he's

1677
01:41:25,883 --> 01:41:30,878
pinned up against the bookcase and probably a
portion of the stonework behind him. He's now got

1678
01:41:30,878 --> 01:41:36,237
blood pouring out the sides of his face and
outside the front of his nose. The duergar being held

1679
01:41:36,283 --> 01:41:43,093
up against the wall says, "Whatever you haven't
killed. The army's probably up with the king

1680
01:41:43,093 --> 01:41:52,434
"himself. They're all waiting for you and I hope
they piss on your body when they're done!" At

1681
01:41:52,434 --> 01:41:59,274
which point she takes the blade and twists it. As
she does, he gives this guttural yelp and his eyes

1682
01:41:59,274 --> 01:42:03,739
just go blank. Blanker than the duergar eyes
normally are.

1683
01:42:03,739 --> 01:42:06,488
ORION: I make it to the doorway and go, what is
going on in here?

1684
01:42:06,488 --> 01:42:11,397
LAURA: Are there any-- taking that in-- any
healing potions or anything in

1685
01:42:11,397 --> 01:42:13,373
here that we could use?

1686
01:42:13,373 --> 01:42:15,529
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

1687
01:42:15,529 --> 01:42:21,906
SAM: Can I look at the door and see if the trap
will go off again if we step through it again?

1688
01:42:21,906 --> 01:42:23,297
MATT: Perception check.

1689
01:42:23,297 --> 01:42:26,194
SAM: 20.

1690
01:42:26,194 --> 01:42:31,364
MATT: Looks like, from glancing about the room and
getting a feel for it, there were three traps that

1691
01:42:31,364 --> 01:42:35,131
were all placed directly at the front of the door,
basically to give him a point of defense, they've

1692
01:42:35,131 --> 01:42:37,784
all been triggered, so you don't have to worry
about any more in this room.

1693
01:42:37,784 --> 01:42:39,350
LAURA: Is this still considered the Underdark?

1694
01:42:39,350 --> 01:42:40,396
MATT: This is, yes.

1695
01:42:40,396 --> 01:42:41,416
LAURA: Oh, cool!

1696
01:42:41,416 --> 01:42:42,737
SAM: I'm going to go in and look around some
more.

1697
01:42:42,737 --> 01:42:44,554
MATT: You're looking around as well?

1698
01:42:44,554 --> 01:42:46,500
SAM: Look around for potions and stuff.

1699
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:51,132
LAURA: Oh, that's considered the-- aw, I could have
been rolling twice for all these damn things!

1700
01:42:51,202 --> 01:42:52,974
MATT: (sings) Remember your abilities.

1701
01:42:52,974 --> 01:42:54,340
LAURA: (sings) 25.

1702
01:42:54,340 --> 01:42:55,400
MATT: Okay.

1703
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:57,637
SAM: Who's the singer here, people?

1704
01:42:57,637 --> 01:43:04,298
MATT: Sorry, Scanlan. So, as Kima pulls the blade
from its body, kicking it off the greatsword and

1705
01:43:04,298 --> 01:43:07,880
wiping it across the leather on the side-- the
leather that you gave to her! And a little part of

1706
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:09,407
you is like, (sadly) hmm.

1707
01:43:09,407 --> 01:43:11,386
LIAM: That's all right. Worth it. This halfling's
hot.

1708
01:43:11,386 --> 01:43:17,251
MATT: So you guys made your way back, Clarota's
there, against the corner, and Grog rushes over,

1709
01:43:17,251 --> 01:43:20,242
just feeling like he was ready for action. "What's
going on?"

1710
01:43:20,242 --> 01:43:22,336
ASHLEY: You're too late.

1711
01:43:22,336 --> 01:43:26,042
MARISHA: This might be a good time to stop for a
moment.

1712
01:43:26,042 --> 01:43:29,445
MATT: That's up to you guys, as I say, do you guys
want to take a short rest?

1713
01:43:29,445 --> 01:43:31,145
LAURA: Did I find any potions? Did I find
anything?

1714
01:43:31,145 --> 01:43:39,388
MATT: Yes. Glancing around the room, you manage to
find two potions of healing, one potion of

1715
01:43:39,388 --> 01:43:40,722
superior healing.

1716
01:43:40,722 --> 01:43:41,823
ALL: Ooh.

1717
01:43:41,823 --> 01:43:44,596
LAURA: What is that? That's major.

1718
01:43:44,596 --> 01:43:45,903
MARISHA: That's cool.

1719
01:43:45,903 --> 01:43:49,411
MATT: You also find one vial of some sort of
weird, viscous yellow liquid

1720
01:43:49,411 --> 01:43:50,953
that you cannot identify.

1721
01:43:50,953 --> 01:43:56,814
MARISHA: Oh, don't open that. Who knows how long
those guards had to be staked out here?

1722
01:43:56,814 --> 01:43:58,299
Don't open that.

1723
01:43:58,299 --> 01:44:01,300
SAM: Can I do a-- can I investigate it or arcana
it?

1724
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:05,774
MATT: Sure, you can give it a go.

1725
01:44:05,774 --> 01:44:07,569
SAM: Yeah. That's a one.

1726
01:44:07,569 --> 01:44:08,432
LAURA: Oh good.

1727
01:44:08,432 --> 01:44:11,703
SAM: Oh wait, no, that's a seven. These dice are
horrible. Anyway, it doesn't matter. It's bad.

1728
01:44:11,703 --> 01:44:17,935
MATT: It looks delicious. No, actually, you can't
make out, it has some changing color as you kind

1729
01:44:17,935 --> 01:44:24,003
of swirl the bottle and watch the texture inside
shift and change with the centrifugal force. You

1730
01:44:24,003 --> 01:44:27,548
can't make out anything about its intent, but it
does feel like it's a potion

1731
01:44:27,548 --> 01:44:28,634
created with some effect.

1732
01:44:28,634 --> 01:44:29,982
SAM: Tiberius, do you want to drink this?

1733
01:44:29,982 --> 01:44:37,112
ORION: No! What is it? I check it for 18.

1734
01:44:37,112 --> 01:44:38,229
SAM: For what?

1735
01:44:38,229 --> 01:44:40,325
ORION: For whatever you're trying to hand to me.

1736
01:44:40,325 --> 01:44:47,430
MATT: 18 arcana? Okay. You take a look at it. It
definitely is magical, you don't have a lot of

1737
01:44:47,430 --> 01:44:54,074
experience with alchemy but you gather that the
effect that it would have upon imbibement would be

1738
01:44:54,074 --> 01:44:58,065
to alter your physical form in some way, you just
don't know the specific effects.

1739
01:44:58,065 --> 01:45:01,364
ORION: Absolutely, Scanlan, I'll take that for
now. And I put it in my pouch.

1740
01:45:01,364 --> 01:45:04,027
TALIESIN: Let's take a short rest.

1741
01:45:04,027 --> 01:45:09,641
MATT: So, as you guys all kind of enter this room,
this brief safe zone to take a short rest, if you

1742
01:45:09,641 --> 01:45:12,810
feel you want to heal yourself up and regain any
short rest-based abilities, do so.

1743
01:45:12,810 --> 01:45:15,090
MARISHA: Can we talk about what this duergar just
told us?

1744
01:45:15,090 --> 01:45:16,999
LAURA: Can we go to the bathroom before we do
that?

1745
01:45:16,999 --> 01:45:22,167
MATT: That's what I was going to say. We can
return-- So we're going to take a quick bathroom

1746
01:45:22,167 --> 01:45:25,760
break, we're going to play the videos again, we'll
return here in just a second, as the next element

1747
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,614
of the attack on Emberhold continues.

1748
01:45:28,614 --> 01:45:32,785
MARISHA: Oh, and this is your last chance because
after the break we'll pick a winner for the

1749
01:45:32,785 --> 01:45:40,810
Espionage giveaway. So, last chance if you want to
tweet @EspionageMakeup and #CriticalRole and look

1750
01:45:40,810 --> 01:45:45,001
at our sweet nails! They're awesome. They're
cool.

1751
01:45:45,001 --> 01:45:47,534
MATT: (whispers) Galaxies! All right, see you guys
in a second.

1752
01:45:47,534 --> 01:45:50,295
ORION: I have text and whatnot.

1753
01:45:50,295 --> 02:01:27,903
[break]

1754
02:01:27,903 --> 02:01:32,712
MATT: Welcome back, guys! All right, so we've had
ourselves sufficiently rested.

1755
02:01:32,712 --> 02:01:40,566
ZAC: Indeed we have. We have a Tabletop Promo Day
kit to give away, because you guys got the 50 subs

1756
02:01:40,566 --> 02:01:42,002
since we started today.

1757
02:01:42,002 --> 02:01:43,142
MATT: Which is awesome.

1758
02:01:43,142 --> 02:01:48,069
ZAC: And we'll give away another one with another
signed poster at the end of the night if you get

1759
02:01:48,123 --> 02:01:55,023
another 50. So we're about to give this away, but
I just want to remind you guys to donate to 826LA.

1760
02:01:55,023 --> 02:02:00,864
That's the group that Critical Role is supporting,
and these guys are here out of the graces of their

1761
02:02:00,864 --> 02:02:05,457
heart, and it would be very helpful for you guys
to donate to them and show your love for Critical

1762
02:02:05,457 --> 02:02:10,142
Role by donating to the charity. We'll post the
link in the chat. Get those donations rolling!

1763
02:02:10,142 --> 02:02:11,344
MATT: Awesome.

1764
02:02:11,344 --> 02:02:12,288
ZAC: Zac out!

1765
02:02:12,288 --> 02:02:15,473
MATT: All right, thank you, Zac! Couple of quick
things. You wanted to announce the Espionage--

1766
02:02:15,473 --> 02:02:22,649
MARISHA: Yes! Our winner for the Espionage Bath
Bombs Tabletop from @espionagemakeup goes to

1767
02:02:22,649 --> 02:02:30,599
(drumroll) Danny Carr. Who is @Eleine35. So,
Danny, I'm pretty sure you follow me on Twitter,

1768
02:02:30,599 --> 02:02:35,328
just PM me your address and I'll get these out to
you. And thank you!

1769
02:02:35,328 --> 02:02:38,173
MATT: Yeah, did you follow him? Because you have
to follow him--

1770
02:02:38,173 --> 02:02:41,525
MARISHA: Oh, I have to follow-- Oh, well then I'll
follow Danny right now.

1771
02:02:41,525 --> 02:02:47,730
MATT: Awesome! Also, as a heads-up, guys, we've
had some people perpetually asking us about the

1772
02:02:47,730 --> 02:02:49,446
shirts that we made.

1773
02:02:49,446 --> 02:02:52,417
ORION: You mean these shirts?

1774
02:02:52,417 --> 02:03:01,481
MATT: That shirt right there. So, we have a-- it's
a temporary-- it's very basic, but we have up, if

1775
02:03:01,481 --> 02:03:05,542
you guys ever want to go to critrole.com, we have
a limited run of those shirts currently available

1776
02:03:05,542 --> 02:03:06,606
for purchase.

1777
02:03:06,606 --> 02:03:09,479
MARISHA: Very limited, like once they're gone,
they're gone.

1778
02:03:09,479 --> 02:03:14,076
LAURA: It's less than-- probably less than 15 of
each size, less than that, probably. It was a

1779
02:03:14,076 --> 02:03:15,178
small amount.

1780
02:03:15,178 --> 02:03:18,618
LIAM: I was wearing mine earlier today and I only
rolled 20s. Only.

1781
02:03:18,618 --> 02:03:28,902
MARISHA: It's true. So, it's www.critrole.com,
and, yeah, and the site is still under

1782
02:03:28,902 --> 02:03:35,006
construction, so. But we managed to rush it out,
and I wanna give a huge shout-out to Michael

1783
02:03:35,006 --> 02:03:38,023
Whitesman, who's a big friend of ours, for helping
us make the website

1784
02:03:38,023 --> 02:03:39,590
ORION: Thanks, Whitey!

1785
02:03:39,590 --> 02:03:43,959
MARISHA: @whitesly, if you want to bug him, and,
yeah, so, if you buy--

1786
02:03:43,959 --> 02:03:46,101
ORION: That's his nickname! It's not like a--

1787
02:03:46,101 --> 02:03:48,754
MARISHA: Whitesly! His last name is Whitesly.

1788
02:03:48,754 --> 02:03:52,538
ORION: I know. But I said, "What's up Whitey,"
like, to him personally, and then they look at me

1789
02:03:52,538 --> 02:03:54,885
like, "Oh my lord, that's so racist."

1790
02:03:54,885 --> 02:03:56,201
(laughter)

1791
02:03:56,201 --> 02:03:57,924
ORION: And I'm like, no, no, it's his nickname.
It's okay.

1792
02:03:57,924 --> 02:03:59,338
MATT: That is actually his nickname.

1793
02:03:59,338 --> 02:04:01,421
LIAM: I'm just sad that you don't call me Whitey.

1794
02:04:01,421 --> 02:04:03,260
ORION: I mean, I can.

1795
02:04:03,260 --> 02:04:05,509
LIAM: Okay. Let's start. After this game.

1796
02:04:05,509 --> 02:04:12,610
MARISHA: Anyways. Anyways, you can go buy t-shirts
now, which was the whole point of that. At

1797
02:04:12,610 --> 02:04:16,649
critrole.com. And there's a limited run. Once
they're gone, they're gone.

1798
02:04:16,649 --> 02:04:21,739
MATT: The cost includes shipping. We'll get--
we're packaging them ourselves. We'll have,

1799
02:04:21,739 --> 02:04:24,943
hopefully, more in the future, but this is the
first attempt at trying to do something like this

1800
02:04:24,943 --> 02:04:26,013
for you guys, so--

1801
02:04:26,013 --> 02:04:29,739
MARISHA: Yeah. We're doing this all ourselves just
to, just 'cause-- See how this works. You guys--

1802
02:04:29,739 --> 02:04:32,491
LAURA: And that includes the shipping, that's why
the price is--

1803
02:04:32,491 --> 02:04:36,445
ASHLEY: So future t-shirts-- Were you guys saying
something, like it would be artwork from--

1804
02:04:36,445 --> 02:04:43,705
MARISHA: Yes, this was, we got this from
@rusegafdi. He wore this at Tabletop Day, so--

1805
02:04:43,705 --> 02:04:45,792
LAURA: A very similar design, so yeah.

1806
02:04:45,792 --> 02:04:50,489
MARISHA: Yeah, so we're-- we decided we're going
to do, like, fan-designed t-shirts. So, once every

1807
02:04:50,489 --> 02:04:55,811
so often, we'll do a fan-designed t-shirt, and
yes. And then--

1808
02:04:55,811 --> 02:04:57,866
but they'll all be limited, so yeah!

1809
02:04:57,866 --> 02:05:01,400
MATT: Yeah. Shipping, shipping is included with
the price, guys, don't worry. But yeah. So,

1810
02:05:01,400 --> 02:05:04,698
anyway, check that out! Thank you guys so much,
and let's go ahead

1811
02:05:04,698 --> 02:05:06,415
and get back to the game proper.

1812
02:05:06,415 --> 02:05:10,307
CREW: Hey, the t-shirts are sold out already.
They're now sold out. They bought all of them.

1813
02:05:10,307 --> 02:05:12,525
MARISHA: T-shirts are sold out!

1814
02:05:12,525 --> 02:05:13,666
ORION: Wait, what?

1815
02:05:13,666 --> 02:05:16,085
TALIESIN: We didn't even finish telling you
people!

1816
02:05:16,085 --> 02:05:17,963
LAURA: No they're not.

1817
02:05:17,963 --> 02:05:19,394
TALIESIN: Let us finish our sentence first!

1818
02:05:19,394 --> 02:05:23,693
MATT: Okay, so, so, so the limited run was very
limited--

1819
02:05:23,693 --> 02:05:27,317
MARISHA: Holy shit!

1820
02:05:27,317 --> 02:05:29,084
MATT: I guess we'll have to order some more,
then.

1821
02:05:29,084 --> 02:05:32,551
SAM: Uh, mental note: make more t-shirts.

1822
02:05:32,551 --> 02:05:34,545
MARISHA: We didn't know! We didn't know!

1823
02:05:34,545 --> 02:05:38,416
MATT: We were gauging interest. I guess there's
interest.

1824
02:05:38,416 --> 02:05:46,428
MARISHA: I'm sorry! Now I almost feel guilty.
Congratulations to the 100 people who got 'em.

1825
02:05:46,428 --> 02:05:52,513
ORION: Hold on. Tiberius is gonna work some magic,
and then try to conjure up a few more. He was

1826
02:05:52,513 --> 02:05:56,517
unaware there was a shortage of, of those-- okay.

1827
02:05:56,517 --> 02:06:00,630
MATT: Sorry, guys, all right, well, we'll-- thank
you guys very much,

1828
02:06:00,630 --> 02:06:02,518
we'll get more to you very soon.

1829
02:06:02,518 --> 02:06:07,876
MARISHA: I don't know what to say! Oh god, I'm
like, going to cry.

1830
02:06:07,876 --> 02:06:12,152
LAURA: Second run, yeah! Just hashtag them
critical role and we'll-- oh, but if you're

1831
02:06:12,152 --> 02:06:14,500
selling them already, there's
somebody that's making really cool t-shirts on

1832
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:18,510
Redbubble, but if you're making them there, like,
we can't print them too, so, like, just submit

1833
02:06:18,510 --> 02:06:19,977
them to us, and then we can--

1834
02:06:19,977 --> 02:06:25,525
MATT: Yeah, we'll figure it out! Anyway, guys,
thank you so much! Let's get to the game!

1835
02:06:25,525 --> 02:06:27,777
TALIESIN: Thank you! Cool!

1836
02:06:27,777 --> 02:06:32,660
SAM: Guys, guys, the chatroom just solved the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict!

1837
02:06:32,660 --> 02:06:34,386
(laughter)

1838
02:06:34,386 --> 02:06:37,374
MATT: Thank you so much, chat! Nice.

1839
02:06:37,374 --> 02:06:41,592
TALIESIN: We've got a box of stuff coming right
for you right now. Thank you.

1840
02:06:41,592 --> 02:06:48,213
MARISHA: Oh my god, I'm like, shaking.

1841
02:06:48,213 --> 02:06:53,710
MATT: All right, so. For all who didn't get 'em,
we'll have more soon, I promise.

1842
02:06:53,710 --> 02:06:59,671
LIAM: Do you guys like &? What is that?

1843
02:06:59,671 --> 02:07:02,266
MARISHA: (laughs) We didn't know if people liked
our show or not!

1844
02:07:02,266 --> 02:07:07,571
MATT: So. So. So, you've housed yourselves into this
enchanting room, this magical laboratory, and

1845
02:07:07,571 --> 02:07:12,108
taken about a 15-minute rest. You're able to use
any of your unused hit dice to heal yourself up if

1846
02:07:12,188 --> 02:07:13,850
need be. Any--

1847
02:07:13,850 --> 02:07:17,678
ASHLEY: Oh, well, where's everybody at? 'Cause
maybe I can just do a-- some healing up.

1848
02:07:17,678 --> 02:07:19,225
TALIESIN: I just spent a healing surge, so.

1849
02:07:19,225 --> 02:07:20,981
LAURA: Well, he's, well, as far as health goes--

1850
02:07:20,981 --> 02:07:22,563
LIAM: I'm low, yeah, I'm pretty low.

1851
02:07:22,563 --> 02:07:23,710
ASHLEY: Yeah, what are you at?

1852
02:07:23,710 --> 02:07:25,024
MATT: How many hit dice do you have left?

1853
02:07:25,024 --> 02:07:29,431
LIAM: I know, I have, I don't have that many left.
I'm at, like-- I accidentally erased it, but I

1854
02:07:29,431 --> 02:07:31,113
believe I'm at 30?

1855
02:07:31,113 --> 02:07:36,413
ASHLEY: Ooh, yeah, you-- I need to, I'll get on
that. Anybody else? What's everybody at?

1856
02:07:36,413 --> 02:07:39,703
SAM: I can sing to you and give you an extra
little roll.

1857
02:07:39,703 --> 02:07:43,262
LIAM: I'd like you to sing to me, either in the
game or on another day.

1858
02:07:43,262 --> 02:07:45,400
SAM: Are you Vex or Vax? (laughs)

1859
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:46,724
LIAM: I'm Vix.

1860
02:07:46,724 --> 02:07:50,333
SAM: All right, I'll sing to you and-- are you
gonna use a dice?

1861
02:07:50,333 --> 02:07:55,956
LIAM: Thank you. Ah, let me see how beautiful your
song is

1862
02:07:55,956 --> 02:08:01,483
SAM: (sings) Heal the Vax, make him a better elf.

1863
02:08:01,483 --> 02:08:07,479
SAM and ASHLEY: (sings) For you and for me and the
entire adventuring band.

1864
02:08:07,479 --> 02:08:16,812
SAM: (sings) There are duergar dying, if you cared
enough for the adventurers, you'd bring Vax back

1865
02:08:16,812 --> 02:08:21,578
to help us with the stabby-stab. Thank you, thank
you, thank you.

1866
02:08:21,578 --> 02:08:23,639
LIAM: And please, vaccinate your kids.

1867
02:08:23,639 --> 02:08:27,835
(laughter)

1868
02:08:27,835 --> 02:08:29,820
LIAM: I mean, don't Vax-inate them.

1869
02:08:29,820 --> 02:08:33,085
MATT: Yeah, there's the difference. All right, so.

1870
02:08:33,085 --> 02:08:35,362
SAM: You get a 1d6 for that.

1871
02:08:35,362 --> 02:08:37,463
MATT: So, an extra 1d6 healing to anyone.

1872
02:08:37,463 --> 02:08:39,410
LIAM: Who needs more than one? Three, okay.

1873
02:08:39,410 --> 02:08:44,934
ASHLEY: I healed you, 18, which was actually low,
but I rolled really high for each roll.

1874
02:08:44,934 --> 02:08:46,005
That's my--

1875
02:08:46,005 --> 02:08:50,307
LIAM: Oh, thanks. That's very good. Okay, great, I
am almost tip-top condition, thank you.

1876
02:08:50,307 --> 02:08:51,818
I have a blister.

1877
02:08:51,818 --> 02:08:56,226
MATT: So, as you guys manage to pull yourself out
of your rest mode, you now glance out, and the

1878
02:08:56,226 --> 02:09:01,346
hallway's still quiet, you can hear the movement
of footsteps up above you. What is your intent?

1879
02:09:01,346 --> 02:09:04,618
SAM: To win!

1880
02:09:04,618 --> 02:09:09,971
MARISHA: Okay. Wait, what are we gonna do, 'cause
here's-- there's an army waiting upstairs for us?

1881
02:09:09,971 --> 02:09:14,058
LIAM: They know we're up there, but Kima needs her
stuff, and we need to kind of

1882
02:09:14,058 --> 02:09:15,598
put an end to this problem.

1883
02:09:15,598 --> 02:09:18,332
MARISHA: I'm gonna hop out of tiger form, by the
way, since we rested and stuff.

1884
02:09:18,332 --> 02:09:19,787
SAM: Wait, they're above us?

1885
02:09:19,787 --> 02:09:26,704
LIAM: Yeah, they're all upstairs, including the
mind flayer who vanished from the room we're in,

1886
02:09:26,704 --> 02:09:32,097
so I'm sure he told everyone what's going on. But
they don't know we've found the secret entrance,

1887
02:09:32,097 --> 02:09:36,019
so I think we should go-- Vex'ahlia's correct, we
should use the stairwell

1888
02:09:36,019 --> 02:09:37,381
near the secret entrance.

1889
02:09:37,381 --> 02:09:40,619
ORION: Are we sure there's no other way out of
here, through this particular floor?

1890
02:09:40,619 --> 02:09:42,178
Is that the only exit?

1891
02:09:42,178 --> 02:09:45,864
LAURA: There's-- I mean, there's the front
entrance, there's that door over there, there's

1892
02:09:45,864 --> 02:09:50,097
like two other stairways, but we should use this
back one, by the back entrance.

1893
02:09:50,097 --> 02:09:56,933
LIAM: Also, Lady Kima, our purpose here was to
find you, but your purpose is somewhat greater

1894
02:09:56,933 --> 02:10:01,516
than our own. What do you suggest we do in this
moment?

1895
02:10:01,516 --> 02:10:07,929
MATT: As she stands up, and she holds the
greatsword and swings it a bit. "What I'm seeking

1896
02:10:07,929 --> 02:10:16,514
"lies deeper into this cavern. Whatever is at the
heart of this illithid scourge." And she glances

1897
02:10:16,514 --> 02:10:21,466
over at Clarota-- who's in the back corner, hands
folded-- and there's a slight mental hiss sound in

1898
02:10:21,466 --> 02:10:31,588
her direction. "There's something far darker at
the heart of this temple. I've seen it. But I have

1899
02:10:31,588 --> 02:10:38,959
"my thoughts and my ideas, but I need confirmation
before I speak of any doom-saying. However, the

1900
02:10:38,959 --> 02:10:45,698
"link between those foul creatures and the assault
that's currently mounting against Kraghammer lie

1901
02:10:45,698 --> 02:10:48,439
"upstairs at the center of this duergar people."

1902
02:10:48,439 --> 02:10:53,976
SAM: Oh, here? Here at-- where we are now? Yes,
here?

1903
02:10:53,976 --> 02:10:56,674
MATT: "The link between this K'varn character--"

1904
02:10:56,674 --> 02:11:06,211
LIAM: And let me ask you this. We can be on the
same page, we can go up and fuck shit up. However,

1905
02:11:06,211 --> 02:11:12,712
your weapons and armor-- would they be a great
help? Should they be our short-term purpose, or

1906
02:11:12,712 --> 02:11:15,537
should we just go up and try to end this problem?

1907
02:11:15,537 --> 02:11:20,598
MATT: "To be honest, we've entirely lost the
element of surprise. I would not wish to sacrifice

1908
02:11:20,643 --> 02:11:27,061
"as foolishly for a few additional trinkets of my
own when I feel that this should do well enough,

1909
02:11:27,061 --> 02:11:30,615
"as long as we manage to work together and be smart
about this."

1910
02:11:30,615 --> 02:11:36,432
LAURA: So we should potentially just leave this
castle for now and go find K'varn, rest up--

1911
02:11:36,432 --> 02:11:37,720
SAM: No, no, no.

1912
02:11:37,720 --> 02:11:39,750
LIAM: No, Kima is saying this is the main event.

1913
02:11:39,750 --> 02:11:46,724
SAM: She just said there's a link upstairs. The
link from-- to K'varn that we need to--

1914
02:11:46,724 --> 02:11:48,735
LAURA: I get it! Okay. Yeah.

1915
02:11:48,735 --> 02:11:51,888
MATT: "How do you think K'varn is able to send
these armies up again and again towards the back

1916
02:11:51,888 --> 02:11:53,268
"door of Kraghammer?"

1917
02:11:53,268 --> 02:11:54,486
LAURA: Right.

1918
02:11:54,486 --> 02:11:58,127
MATT: "Besides, if we go on and leave them as they
are, who's to say they wouldn't come up behind us,

1919
02:11:58,127 --> 02:12:00,601
"and then we're fighting a two-sided front once we
get there?"

1920
02:12:00,601 --> 02:12:03,190
LAURA: Then let's-- We gotta go upstairs.

1921
02:12:03,190 --> 02:12:07,844
LIAM: Vox Machina, our years are short. Let's make
good use of them.

1922
02:12:07,844 --> 02:12:10,106
SAM: Let's leave this decision up to Grog.

1923
02:12:10,106 --> 02:12:12,372
ORION: Absolutely not!

1924
02:12:12,372 --> 02:12:13,523
(laughter)

1925
02:12:13,523 --> 02:12:18,542
MATT: Grog's standing there clutching his
greataxe. "I say, I haven't been able to kill much

1926
02:12:18,542 --> 02:12:22,355
"since we got here. Let's kill something!"

1927
02:12:22,355 --> 02:12:24,543
ORION: That's a terrible idea.

1928
02:12:24,543 --> 02:12:26,613
LAURA: Have some ale before we go out, Grog.

1929
02:12:26,613 --> 02:12:30,920
MATT: "Oh, yeah, of course." And he goes into his
bag of holding, and pulls out his now half-empty

1930
02:12:30,920 --> 02:12:36,264
cask, and you see him frown as he hears it clink
around. He pours everyone a small drink, to what

1931
02:12:36,264 --> 02:12:37,848
is now an empty cask.

1932
02:12:37,848 --> 02:12:40,673
LAURA: This could potentially kill us all.

1933
02:12:40,673 --> 02:12:42,329
TRAVIS: Vox Machina.

1934
02:12:42,329 --> 02:12:44,555
ALL: Vox Machina!

1935
02:12:44,555 --> 02:12:47,115
LAURA: Scanlan had a great idea, though. Should we
talk about what Scanlan wants to do?

1936
02:12:47,115 --> 02:12:50,946
SAM: Ah, yes, I have an idea. But also, are there
two stairs up to the top floor?

1937
02:12:50,946 --> 02:12:53,129
LIAM: There's multiple.

1938
02:12:53,129 --> 02:13:00,824
SAM: Perhaps we should use more than one. One,
half of our band go up, create a diversion. The

1939
02:13:00,824 --> 02:13:05,813
other half sneak up and kill, kill, kill. That's
one option. The other option--

1940
02:13:05,813 --> 02:13:07,521
LIAM: Pike leads the diversion group.

1941
02:13:07,521 --> 02:13:09,719
ASHLEY: Definitely the stealthy ones with me.

1942
02:13:09,719 --> 02:13:11,792
(laughter)

1943
02:13:11,792 --> 02:13:19,778
SAM: Ah, I do have an idea about gaining the upper
hand on our first meeting with this army that's

1944
02:13:19,778 --> 02:13:22,462
upstairs. An intimidation technique of some sort.

1945
02:13:22,462 --> 02:13:25,063
MARISHA: You're not going to kill another pony,
are you?

1946
02:13:25,063 --> 02:13:26,456
SAM: I can't anymore.

1947
02:13:26,456 --> 02:13:27,942
MARISHA: Good.

1948
02:13:27,942 --> 02:13:34,656
SAM: Much as I would love to. No, but we've heard
over our eavesdropping that some of these duergar

1949
02:13:34,656 --> 02:13:44,411
bastards are scared of that strange chimera sort
of hodgepodge, human centipede thing? We could be

1950
02:13:44,411 --> 02:13:49,594
one of those with a little bit of deception, and
all of us sort of piling on each other. We could

1951
02:13:49,594 --> 02:13:52,725
act like a big scary monster and go up and freak
the fuck out of them.

1952
02:13:52,725 --> 02:13:55,812
MARISHA: Ah! That's actually a really good idea.

1953
02:13:55,812 --> 02:14:00,697
LAURA: -- all of us piled on Grog and Trinket and
you as the bases, and we become this--

1954
02:14:00,697 --> 02:14:06,391
SAM: They would probably be, at least for the
moment, intimidated a bit, and we could get a few

1955
02:14:06,391 --> 02:14:10,388
licks in before they realized we're just a pile of
idiots running at them.

1956
02:14:10,388 --> 02:14:11,834
(laughter)

1957
02:14:11,834 --> 02:14:13,406
LAURA: I like it.

1958
02:14:13,406 --> 02:14:19,178
MARISHA: So we're basically gonna be like three
kids Little Rascals-style on each other's

1959
02:14:19,178 --> 02:14:21,661
shoulders with a giant coat?

1960
02:14:21,661 --> 02:14:24,614
SAM: But that could be the diversion, at least.

1961
02:14:24,614 --> 02:14:28,037
MARISHA: Okay, well then, why don't-- I actually
like this idea. Why don't we have a few of our

1962
02:14:28,037 --> 02:14:32,684
stealthy members, why don't we have the twins be
in the shadows, and picking people off while--

1963
02:14:32,684 --> 02:14:34,668
LAURA: That's true, 'cause I've got range, so that
makes sense.

1964
02:14:34,668 --> 02:14:37,831
MARISHA: Right, why don't we have some of our
ranged people-- I'll transform. I can transform

1965
02:14:37,831 --> 02:14:41,450
into-- how about a giant scorpion? That sounds
fun.

1966
02:14:41,450 --> 02:14:42,811
SAM: Can you transform into anything?

1967
02:14:42,811 --> 02:14:45,824
MARISHA: I can transform into beasts. They have to
be beasts.

1968
02:14:45,824 --> 02:14:50,770
SAM: How about the type of beast that we know
would scare them, like that big triceratops thing

1969
02:14:50,770 --> 02:14:52,848
that we saw with the big metal thing on it.

1970
02:14:52,848 --> 02:15:00,691
MARISHA: I can be a rhinoceros-- I can be, like--
Can I do dinosaurs? I can be a dinosaur, right?

1971
02:15:00,691 --> 02:15:02,429
That's a new thing I can be, right?

1972
02:15:02,429 --> 02:15:03,894
MATT: Up to a certain point.

1973
02:15:03,894 --> 02:15:11,799
LIAM: What if you were a scorpion, with a
dragonborn tail sliding around and a gnome on your

1974
02:15:11,799 --> 02:15:12,980
front leg and a--

1975
02:15:12,980 --> 02:15:20,945
MARISHA: Well here's, oh wait wait, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay, okay, hang on, hang on, hang on,

1976
02:15:20,945 --> 02:15:26,831
this might be crazy-- wonder what would
happen if I drank that weird yellowish potion?

1977
02:15:26,831 --> 02:15:29,727
While I'm a monster?

1978
02:15:29,727 --> 02:15:32,471
LAURA: No, It could be poison, though.

1979
02:15:32,471 --> 02:15:36,177
MARISHA: But I'm wondering if you can, like, if I
can transform into a monster and then you with

1980
02:15:36,177 --> 02:15:38,234
Polymorph can maybe just transform.

1981
02:15:38,234 --> 02:15:40,434
ORION: Stop talking, stop talking! Hold on.

1982
02:15:40,434 --> 02:15:42,144
(laughter)

1983
02:15:42,144 --> 02:15:43,644
MARISHA: You don't have to snap at me.

1984
02:15:43,644 --> 02:15:46,222
ORION: No, no, no, you're brilliant, your
highness.

1985
02:15:46,222 --> 02:15:49,971
MARISHA: Oh, thank you. I mean.

1986
02:15:49,971 --> 02:15:54,295
ORION: I have an idea, I have an idea.

1987
02:15:54,295 --> 02:15:56,915
LIAM: We're off the rails, here.

1988
02:15:56,915 --> 02:15:59,331
LAURA: Tell it to us, Tiberius, what's the idea?

1989
02:15:59,331 --> 02:16:01,720
SAM: Does it involve shitting on a bed?

1990
02:16:01,720 --> 02:16:03,267
(laughter)

1991
02:16:03,267 --> 02:16:05,235
ORION: Eventually, actually, yes.

1992
02:16:05,235 --> 02:16:06,878
TALIESIN: Aren't you empty yet?

1993
02:16:06,878 --> 02:16:15,418
ORION: This is what's going to happen. As far as
we know, they're all duergar up there, correct?

1994
02:16:15,418 --> 02:16:21,981
LAURA: Mostly, except for the mind flayers. And
another big monster probably, they might have--

1995
02:16:21,981 --> 02:16:25,776
ASHLEY: Which I saw in a vision. I think that's
what's controlling them

1996
02:16:25,776 --> 02:16:30,511
LAURA: Oh no, that's K'varn. No, no, no, he's at
the other one.

1997
02:16:30,511 --> 02:16:34,494
ASHLEY: Sorry, read it wrong.

1998
02:16:34,494 --> 02:16:40,915
ORION: This is what will happen. Those who can go
stealth, we will creep up there. I will go

1999
02:16:40,915 --> 02:16:46,892
invisible myself. I will be in front. You closely
behind me.

2000
02:16:46,892 --> 02:16:48,620
SAM: He has a name.

2001
02:16:48,620 --> 02:17:02,019
ORION: Vax. There we go. You closely behind me,
and whoever else can stealth follows suit. I will

2002
02:17:02,019 --> 02:17:04,901
cast Alter Self and turn myself into their god.

2003
02:17:04,901 --> 02:17:06,398
SAM: Their god?

2004
02:17:06,398 --> 02:17:07,624
ALL: K'varn?

2005
02:17:07,624 --> 02:17:10,156
MARISHA: But you don't know what he looks like.

2006
02:17:10,156 --> 02:17:11,828
LAURA: Oh, or into that other thingie.

2007
02:17:11,828 --> 02:17:13,362
ORION: I absolutely know what he looks like.

2008
02:17:13,362 --> 02:17:15,480
MATT: You mean Laduguer?

2009
02:17:15,638 --> 02:17:17,480
ORION: We just saw his statue.

2010
02:17:17,480 --> 02:17:19,194
MARISHA: Well. that's not K'varn though.

2011
02:17:19,194 --> 02:17:27,913
ORION: But that's who they worship. As I give my,
whatever the hell I come up with to say at that

2012
02:17:27,913 --> 02:17:29,511
particular time--

2013
02:17:29,511 --> 02:17:32,027
SAM: Maybe you should think it first, think it
through first.

2014
02:17:32,027 --> 02:17:42,848
ORION: As soon as the mind flayers catch on, and I
turn to Clarota, and I turn to Kima, that's when

2015
02:17:42,848 --> 02:17:50,347
all of you will strike at them first. The rest of
you will wait 'til I shoot off a couple of

2016
02:17:50,347 --> 02:17:56,107
Fireballs at the duergar once they figure out
we're full of crap. 'Cause I'm sure that might

2017
02:17:56,107 --> 02:18:01,930
happen unless I'm super convincing, which I hope
that's the case-- But I think that's our best bet

2018
02:18:01,930 --> 02:18:04,812
to keep a certain element of surprise.

2019
02:18:04,812 --> 02:18:09,213
MARISHA: So wait, so wait, are you going to be
their god, and I'm still going to also be a crazy

2020
02:18:09,213 --> 02:18:12,985
monster, as like your pet crazy monster, with our
stealthy team, or just--

2021
02:18:12,985 --> 02:18:15,659
TALIESIN: I think the only thing better than their
god would be their god on top of a giant

2022
02:18:15,659 --> 02:18:16,900
scorpion.

2023
02:18:16,900 --> 02:18:19,003
LAURA and MARISHA: Ooh!

2024
02:18:19,003 --> 02:18:20,824
LIAM: I have faith in you, Tiberius.

2025
02:18:20,824 --> 02:18:23,097
MARISHA: You'll be like Xerxes.

2026
02:18:23,097 --> 02:18:33,574
ASHLEY: Can I cast, 'cause I've been wanting to
use Thaumaturgy. Which can make your voice three

2027
02:18:33,574 --> 02:18:35,242
times as louder.

2028
02:18:35,242 --> 02:18:38,397
MATT: At the moment he would be speaking, yeah.

2029
02:18:38,397 --> 02:18:40,725
ASHLEY: At the moment he'd be speaking, okay, so
let's do that.

2030
02:18:40,725 --> 02:18:42,730
LAURA: Oh, that's going to be so cool.

2031
02:18:42,730 --> 02:18:43,961
MARISHA: Some theatrics.

2032
02:18:43,961 --> 02:18:50,823
LIAM: I love it when a good plan comes together.

2033
02:18:50,823 --> 02:18:56,727
SAM: So some of us are stealthing, you're being a
big god who talks loud and is riding a scorpion.

2034
02:18:56,727 --> 02:19:02,583
ASHLEY: So maybe I'll tuck behind him, on top of
you the scorpion, and then when you're getting

2035
02:19:02,583 --> 02:19:06,915
ready to talk I'll just (whoosh) and then you'll--
your voice will be, you know, you'll have--

2036
02:19:06,915 --> 02:19:08,281
LIAM: Yeah, that's good, that's good.

2037
02:19:08,281 --> 02:19:12,089
SAM: How about this-- so, just to clarify, are we
all going up the same staircase, or are we going

2038
02:19:12,175 --> 02:19:14,550
up two separate staircases, Vex and Vax--

2039
02:19:14,550 --> 02:19:18,404
LAURA: I think we should just go up the same
staircase. There's too many of them. If we split

2040
02:19:18,404 --> 02:19:19,931
up we could just all die.

2041
02:19:19,931 --> 02:19:22,756
SAM: You don't know what-- there could be a
million rooms up there.

2042
02:19:22,756 --> 02:19:27,337
LIAM: We have no idea what's up there, but
Tiberius has got a plan, I like it.

2043
02:19:27,337 --> 02:19:29,762
LAURA: If he's the god, we just go in behind him
as the god.

2044
02:19:29,762 --> 02:19:33,977
ASHLEY: What if we did like your Dimension Door?
Is it too not very god-like if he's coming up the

2045
02:19:33,977 --> 02:19:35,927
staircase like, hey?

2046
02:19:35,927 --> 02:19:37,769
SAM: The Dimension Door's off the table.

2047
02:19:37,769 --> 02:19:44,809
LIAM: Tiberius, Tiberius. Tibs.

2048
02:19:44,809 --> 02:19:48,625
SAM: But don't use the god thing. But don't use
the god thing until we get to the big group. The

2049
02:19:48,625 --> 02:19:53,743
big thing, if you see a guard, don't turn into a
god, you gotta see like more than five people

2050
02:19:53,743 --> 02:19:55,569
before you turn into a god.

2051
02:19:55,569 --> 02:19:56,687
LIAM: Tiberius.

2052
02:19:56,687 --> 02:19:57,651
ORION: Yes, Vax?

2053
02:19:57,651 --> 02:20:01,439
LIAM: Do you intend to go up one of the other
stairways? I believe this one by the entrance, the

2054
02:20:01,439 --> 02:20:06,543
secret entrance we came in, will afford us the
element of surprise. Do you think you want to go

2055
02:20:06,543 --> 02:20:08,186
up one of the others?

2056
02:20:08,186 --> 02:20:09,582
ORION: No, let's go up that one.

2057
02:20:09,582 --> 02:20:11,538
LIAM: And make a distraction, right? Your plan is
to make a distraction.

2058
02:20:11,538 --> 02:20:12,872
ORION: Yes, of course.

2059
02:20:12,872 --> 02:20:14,234
LIAM: You're a brave dragonborn.

2060
02:20:14,234 --> 02:20:19,519
MARISHA: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on
the party. Everyone stay close.

2061
02:20:19,519 --> 02:20:22,719
LIAM: Who's the stealth party, not you, you and
me, you.

2062
02:20:22,719 --> 02:20:25,577
MARISHA: Well, all of us, all of us I guess, until
we get upstairs.

2063
02:20:25,577 --> 02:20:28,542
LAURA: Potentially all of us will be stealthed
except for Tiberius, and you who is a scorpion,

2064
02:20:28,542 --> 02:20:30,141
and you who's riding behind Tiberius.

2065
02:20:30,141 --> 02:20:33,600
ASHLEY: I'm riding on her, so I probably won't be
rolling for stealth.

2066
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:35,385
MATT: Uh.

2067
02:20:35,385 --> 02:20:36,688
ASHLEY: Just kidding.

2068
02:20:36,688 --> 02:20:37,561
MATT: You'll be rolling.

2069
02:20:37,561 --> 02:20:39,961
ASHLEY: I probably won't roll well, just putting
it out there.

2070
02:20:39,961 --> 02:20:50,747
MATT: You hear in the back of your mind this
subtle, soft, echoing chuckle. "You're all crazy.

2071
02:20:50,747 --> 02:20:52,972
"I like it."

2072
02:20:52,972 --> 02:20:54,445
(laughter)

2073
02:20:54,445 --> 02:20:59,855
MATT: At which point, Kima, who's listening to all
this with a look of kind of awe and curiosity

2074
02:20:59,855 --> 02:21:03,164
says, "You know, for once? I actually agree with
the thing."

2075
02:21:03,164 --> 02:21:04,866
(laughter)

2076
02:21:04,866 --> 02:21:08,966
MATT: "All right." Takes her greatsword in her
hands. "Lead the way."

2077
02:21:08,966 --> 02:21:15,356
ASHLEY: So you guys are stealthing up first?

2078
02:21:15,356 --> 02:21:20,103
MARISHA: We all have Pass Without a Trace as long
as you stand close enough.

2079
02:21:20,103 --> 02:21:23,398
LIAM: Wait, wait for the inspiration.

2080
02:21:23,398 --> 02:21:27,146
SAM: I have some inspiration dice to give out,
that I can give out as bonus actions. Can I give

2081
02:21:27,146 --> 02:21:29,158
it out before we go into battle?

2082
02:21:29,158 --> 02:21:32,315
MATT: I would say like momentarily, right
beforehand.

2083
02:21:32,315 --> 02:21:36,915
SAM: Okay, good to know. But I can't mass give it
out, just have to give it to one person.

2084
02:21:36,915 --> 02:21:39,735
MATT: It's one of those things where it has to be
in the moment when the adrenaline's pumping, I

2085
02:21:39,735 --> 02:21:42,042
think, for it to last into the combat.

2086
02:21:42,042 --> 02:21:47,459
SAM: Okay, and do we want to send Clarota and Kima
off through a different staircase so we have at

2087
02:21:47,459 --> 02:21:49,663
least a backup plan?

2088
02:21:49,737 --> 02:21:53,192
LAURA: No, no, no stick together. Too big of a
group of an army upstairs to split us up.

2089
02:21:53,192 --> 02:21:54,728
LIAM: Don't split the party.

2090
02:21:54,728 --> 02:22:01,192
SAM: In those action movies, when there's one guy
who goes away for a while, he comes back at the

2091
02:22:01,192 --> 02:22:03,027
end and saves the day. If we did that--

2092
02:22:03,027 --> 02:22:05,294
LAURA: That's not going to be us!

2093
02:22:05,294 --> 02:22:08,105
LIAM: We few, we happy few.

2094
02:22:08,105 --> 02:22:10,457
(laughter)

2095
02:22:10,457 --> 02:22:13,235
LIAM: About to go and do something very stupid.
Let's do it.

2096
02:22:13,235 --> 02:22:16,638
MATT: So you are venturing up which stairway?

2097
02:22:16,638 --> 02:22:18,648
LAURA: The secret one, the one by-- in the storage
room.

2098
02:22:18,648 --> 02:22:22,215
MATT: All right. So. You guys--

2099
02:22:22,215 --> 02:22:26,778
MARISHA: We got this. We got this.

2100
02:22:26,778 --> 02:22:31,578
LAURA: Oh no, Grog fell over. Oh my gosh.

2101
02:22:31,578 --> 02:22:45,369
MARISHA: It's been a good day. What are you going
to say? Are you thinking about this?

2102
02:22:45,369 --> 02:22:46,854
Think about something.

2103
02:22:46,854 --> 02:22:47,992
ORION: Okay.

2104
02:22:47,992 --> 02:22:49,932
MARISHA: Start thinking about this now.

2105
02:22:49,932 --> 02:22:52,280
LIAM: There are rooms up there.

2106
02:22:52,280 --> 02:22:57,024
TALIESIN: What's the name of the god again?

2107
02:22:57,024 --> 02:23:01,346
MARISHA: Laduguer.

2108
02:23:01,346 --> 02:23:07,028
ASHLEY: Can I take off my armor right now?

2109
02:23:07,028 --> 02:23:18,823
MATT: You'd become a soft target. All right, you
guys all make your way up, and you're all

2110
02:23:18,823 --> 02:23:24,847
squeezing into this tiny, tiny room. You're all
shoulder-to-shoulder, essentially. You come up to

2111
02:23:24,847 --> 02:23:29,561
the top area, there's a small box, and there is
just a single stone door.

2112
02:23:29,561 --> 02:23:32,308
LAURA: Check for traps.

2113
02:23:32,308 --> 02:23:37,782
LIAM: Excuse me, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, excuse me Kima, sorry,

2114
02:23:37,782 --> 02:23:43,187
sorry, All right, my hands are on the door. I'm
going to check for traps on this door.

2115
02:23:43,187 --> 02:23:47,482
I get a 21.

2116
02:23:47,482 --> 02:23:53,705
MATT: Okay, you take a moment and you place your
hand along this stone surface. You find that

2117
02:23:53,705 --> 02:23:56,102
there's a low hum to it.

2118
02:23:56,102 --> 02:23:57,735
LIAM: Careful, careful, careful.

2119
02:23:57,735 --> 02:24:04,482
MATT: And you can tell that there's a small,
almost like a thin whisper of string laid across

2120
02:24:04,482 --> 02:24:07,061
the very top of the stone, where the wall meets
it.

2121
02:24:07,061 --> 02:24:14,249
LIAM: Of course I can, of course I can. I'm going
to take care of this, hold on. Yeah, this is

2122
02:24:14,249 --> 02:24:16,272
thieves' tools, correct? 26.

2123
02:24:16,272 --> 02:24:24,048
MATT: 26, okay. You come up and you find that this
is a very, very fine hair trigger. This is

2124
02:24:24,048 --> 02:24:29,667
actually a partial enchantment as part of a
magical trap. You know that with the slightest

2125
02:24:29,667 --> 02:24:36,214
hint of false vibration to it, the door shifting
or hitting it in the wrong place will trigger

2126
02:24:36,214 --> 02:24:41,805
whatever this trap is. And so you bring your tools
up, you manage to place one at the base of each

2127
02:24:41,805 --> 02:24:48,570
point at where this arcane silver thread lies
across. Simultaneously, you take your daggers and

2128
02:24:48,570 --> 02:24:52,994
place them underneath the thread at each ends and
sever them both at the same time. The thin whisper

2129
02:24:52,994 --> 02:24:57,585
of a string just slowly glides down and vanishes
into a small sparkle of light.

2130
02:24:57,585 --> 02:25:01,000
SAM: Cut the red wire.

2131
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:10,508
LIAM: I'm just going to lay my ear on the door and
see what I can hear. That is 21.

2132
02:25:10,508 --> 02:25:14,479
MATT: Hearing it, you hear what sounds like a low
mutter of somewhere in the neighbourhood of ten to

2133
02:25:14,479 --> 02:25:20,016
15 low voices, and the slow, small shuffling of
many, many, many, many footsteps.

2134
02:25:20,016 --> 02:25:25,030
LIAM: Shuffling, you said? And if I listen for a
moment, do I-- does it continue?

2135
02:25:25,030 --> 02:25:30,316
MATT: It, kind of, couple of footsteps, some
talking, soft footprints. You can hear the

2136
02:25:30,316 --> 02:25:31,541
scraping of metal--

2137
02:25:31,541 --> 02:25:36,466
LIAM: And it's the only way we can go is through
this door, right?

2138
02:25:36,466 --> 02:25:37,913
We're all smooshed into this hallway--

2139
02:25:37,913 --> 02:25:39,537
MATT: There is a hallway this way.

2140
02:25:39,537 --> 02:25:44,361
LAURA: Oh, so we stealth down the other hall, we
try.

2141
02:25:44,361 --> 02:25:51,199
LIAM: So I mooshed everyone away from this hall.

2142
02:25:51,199 --> 02:25:55,513
MATT: The whispers and voices aren't directly on
the other side of this wall, they're just in that

2143
02:25:55,513 --> 02:26:02,367
room echoing through, but you do hear a lot of
people there. All right, so, what are you doing?

2144
02:26:02,367 --> 02:26:07,339
LAURA: Well, well, stealthing down that hallway.
Can we check for traps, check for traps, I look,

2145
02:26:07,339 --> 02:26:08,656
I'm perceiving.

2146
02:26:08,656 --> 02:26:10,947
MATT: (laughs) Roll for perceiving

2147
02:26:10,947 --> 02:26:13,799
(laughter)

2148
02:26:13,799 --> 02:26:16,632
LIAM: 23 for Vax.

2149
02:26:16,632 --> 02:26:20,963
LAURA: Oh, I get twice that, good. Oh, good, that
was way better.

2150
02:26:20,963 --> 02:26:22,722
MATT: (laughs)

2151
02:26:22,722 --> 02:26:25,127
LAURA: Ten.

2152
02:26:25,127 --> 02:26:26,873
MATT: Okay, no traps.

2153
02:26:26,873 --> 02:26:27,972
LAURA: Yay!

2154
02:26:27,972 --> 02:26:35,370
MATT: You both glide your way up and peek around
the corner. What you see immediately are six

2155
02:26:35,370 --> 02:26:42,595
duergar all stationed in this hallway guarding
what looks like two large doors and entrance to

2156
02:26:42,595 --> 02:26:46,741
this main chamber. And they're all just standing
there, weapons ready, looking around.

2157
02:26:46,741 --> 02:26:49,460
SAM: Wait, which is the main chamber that you
just--

2158
02:26:49,460 --> 02:26:51,288
MATT: This big chamber here that you--

2159
02:26:51,288 --> 02:26:53,026
SAM: Oh, that we were listening to at the door.

2160
02:26:53,026 --> 02:26:59,456
LIAM: Vax sneaks back to the group and motions
Tiberius over, and Keyleth over.

2161
02:26:59,456 --> 02:27:01,553
SAM: We're doing this?

2162
02:27:01,553 --> 02:27:07,118
LIAM: One moment, one moment. Lightning,
Lightning, who knows Lightning?

2163
02:27:07,118 --> 02:27:12,735
MARISHA: Are you gonna try to Lightning Bolt an
entire line?

2164
02:27:12,735 --> 02:27:15,826
LIAM: Do you know the magic of lightning? I've
seen you do it before, I've seen you.

2165
02:27:15,826 --> 02:27:19,320
MARISHA: I do know it right now.

2166
02:27:19,320 --> 02:27:24,276
LIAM: You know it? Anyone who knows Lightning,
I've seen it done on the battlefield with us,

2167
02:27:24,276 --> 02:27:26,117
person to person to person.

2168
02:27:26,117 --> 02:27:28,009
SAM: I can do it.

2169
02:27:28,009 --> 02:27:31,398
MATT: Who is up once again, clearing his throat in
your presence.

2170
02:27:31,398 --> 02:27:35,145
SAM: Hi! Scanlan here.

2171
02:27:35,145 --> 02:27:38,494
LIAM: Scanlan, you know how to harness the power
of electricity.

2172
02:27:38,494 --> 02:27:44,965
SAM: I don't wanna brag, but I'm a regular Ben
Franklin over here. He's a guy, he's a gnome I

2173
02:27:44,965 --> 02:27:46,097
knew once.

2174
02:27:46,097 --> 02:27:51,603
MARISHA: Scanlan, can you and I focus our Call
Lightning spells together? To Lightning these--

2175
02:27:51,603 --> 02:27:54,657
SAM: I mean, mine's so fricking powerful.

2176
02:27:54,657 --> 02:27:58,944
LIAM: If Scanlan and one of the others does
Lightning at the same time and it goes through

2177
02:27:58,944 --> 02:28:02,273
that line, we could drop them all at once.

2178
02:28:02,273 --> 02:28:04,475
LAURA: But that's noisy, they'll come out.

2179
02:28:04,475 --> 02:28:07,798
LIAM: It's not that noisy, it's not like armor
banging around.

2180
02:28:07,798 --> 02:28:09,756
LAURA: I think it's gonna be noisy, it's not a
stealthy attack.

2181
02:28:09,756 --> 02:28:11,936
TALIESIN: It's a quick way to get rid of six
people, though.

2182
02:28:11,936 --> 02:28:14,463
ORION: Oh, is that what we need to do?

2183
02:28:14,463 --> 02:28:21,004
LIAM: There's a row of duergar around the corner,
they're all in a line like Radio City, we just--

2184
02:28:21,004 --> 02:28:25,766
if I can get-- Scanlan, if you-- what about you,
Keyleth? Do I remember light-- or do you bring it

2185
02:28:25,766 --> 02:28:29,006
down from above? Tiberius.

2186
02:28:29,006 --> 02:28:30,624
ORION: What, what?

2187
02:28:30,624 --> 02:28:34,842
SAM: Do you want me to shock 'em?

2188
02:28:34,842 --> 02:28:39,182
ORION: Oh, I have an idea. Okay, I'll peek
around.

2189
02:28:39,182 --> 02:28:41,747
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

2190
02:28:41,747 --> 02:28:44,241
ORION: Sweet.

2191
02:28:44,241 --> 02:28:46,408
MARISHA: You have plus ten because of my Pass
Without a Trace.

2192
02:28:46,408 --> 02:28:49,075
LIAM: You've got six duergar in a row. Is there
anything you can do that's--

2193
02:28:49,075 --> 02:28:50,188
ORION: 27.

2194
02:28:50,188 --> 02:28:55,534
MATT: That's when you see this long row of duergar
that are all kind of armored and ready, guarding

2195
02:28:55,534 --> 02:28:57,356
the front of this chamber.

2196
02:28:57,356 --> 02:29:03,771
ORION: I cast Watery Sphere at the end of the last
guy and create a giant ball.

2197
02:29:03,771 --> 02:29:06,571
LIAM: Wait, you're doing it now?

2198
02:29:06,571 --> 02:29:08,952
ORION: What does it look like, Vax?

2199
02:29:08,952 --> 02:29:12,512
MATT: Okay, so this giant water sphere appears. At
which side of the wall?

2200
02:29:12,512 --> 02:29:18,254
ORION: On the last guy. Yeah, and I draw it
towards us.

2201
02:29:18,254 --> 02:29:21,405
LIAM: Vax is grabbing the gnome and tossing him
out to the right,

2202
02:29:21,405 --> 02:29:23,149
out here at the front of the group.

2203
02:29:23,149 --> 02:29:25,506
ORION: And I stop at the last guy.

2204
02:29:25,506 --> 02:29:31,308
MATT: Okay, as the water sphere begins to pull in.
Saving throws, what's your DC?

2205
02:29:31,308 --> 02:29:33,956
ORION: My spell DC, 17.

2206
02:29:33,956 --> 02:29:37,971
MATT: This is a dexterity save? All right.

2207
02:29:37,971 --> 02:29:43,710
SAM: One at a time.

2208
02:29:43,710 --> 02:29:45,869
MATT: All of them fail!

2209
02:29:45,869 --> 02:29:48,213
(cheering)

2210
02:29:48,213 --> 02:29:52,830
MARISHA: This is gonna be cool, this is gonna be
cool. It's gonna put them all in one spot.

2211
02:29:52,830 --> 02:29:54,925
SAM: They were already in a line.

2212
02:29:54,925 --> 02:29:59,224
MARISHA: No, now we can electrocute them and
they're wet!

2213
02:29:59,293 --> 02:30:06,534
MATT: There is now an entire clustered sphere of
water that is containing a mishmash of duergar.

2214
02:30:06,534 --> 02:30:10,899
MARISHA: Lightning Bolt!

2215
02:30:10,899 --> 02:30:16,496
MATT: Call Lightning. All right, so, as Keyleth,
you step forward, out in the hallway, you bring

2216
02:30:16,496 --> 02:30:21,056
your arm up and there's this small cluster of dark
clouds beginning to form and swirl up on the top

2217
02:30:21,056 --> 02:30:26,603
of the 20-foot hallway. As it swirls, you bring
your arm downward, and there's a sudden crack of

2218
02:30:26,603 --> 02:30:31,891
thunder, a loud blasting sound that echoes through
the hallway. As the lightning strikes the center

2219
02:30:31,891 --> 02:30:39,352
of the sphere, the water itself bursts as the
actual cacophonous blast of the lightning loosely

2220
02:30:39,352 --> 02:30:43,108
shakes the aquatic sphere. However, go ahead and
roll damage.

2221
02:30:43,108 --> 02:30:45,285
MARISHA: Do I get any more damage because of
the--

2222
02:30:45,285 --> 02:30:48,320
MATT: You get an additional two dice of damage to
each one of the duergar because they are contained

2223
02:30:48,320 --> 02:30:49,427
in the water.

2224
02:30:49,427 --> 02:30:50,503
ORION: Yeah!

2225
02:30:50,503 --> 02:30:52,290
MARISHA: So 5d10?

2226
02:30:52,290 --> 02:30:53,505
MATT: Correct.

2227
02:30:53,505 --> 02:30:55,021
MARISHA: Do I roll for each one?

2228
02:30:55,021 --> 02:30:59,739
MATT: You just roll once, and that's across the
board for all of them, and they are at a

2229
02:30:59,739 --> 02:31:02,097
disadvantage because they are in the sphere.

2230
02:31:02,097 --> 02:31:03,699
MARISHA: Oh, and they're at a disadvantage?

2231
02:31:03,699 --> 02:31:06,035
ORION: Yeah, yeah, because I'm like holding them
up.

2232
02:31:06,035 --> 02:31:07,882
MARISHA: All right.

2233
02:31:07,882 --> 02:31:10,521
MATT: It's really funny, because two of them
rolled 20s in a row, but they're at a

2234
02:31:10,521 --> 02:31:11,771
disadvantage.

2235
02:31:11,771 --> 02:31:23,569
MARISHA: Nice. Not too shabby. So we have ten, 19
plus 18, bringing it to 28 plus three, 31 plus

2236
02:31:23,569 --> 02:31:25,026
one. 32.

2237
02:31:25,026 --> 02:31:30,645
MATT: Okay. So the sphere explodes, the actual
stone on the ground you can feel shake and shudder

2238
02:31:30,645 --> 02:31:36,245
with the impact of the lightning storm. All but
one of the duergar are blown apart and scattered

2239
02:31:36,245 --> 02:31:44,001
across the wall Akira-style, just (splat) against
the walls. One of them is still in the center of

2240
02:31:44,001 --> 02:31:48,640
the sphere, now looking charred and burnt, and
eyes wide open with anger and frustration.

2241
02:31:48,640 --> 02:31:52,304
MARISHA: Scanlan, go!

2242
02:31:52,304 --> 02:32:02,105
SAM: I say, (chants) you ugly, you ugly, yo mama
says you ugly! And I cast Vicious Mockery.

2243
02:32:02,105 --> 02:32:05,949
(laughter)

2244
02:32:05,949 --> 02:32:09,794
MATT: He rolled a 14 vs the DC which I think is--

2245
02:32:09,794 --> 02:32:10,962
SAM: 19.

2246
02:32:10,962 --> 02:32:12,536
MATT: All right, how much total did you do?

2247
02:32:12,536 --> 02:32:14,641
SAM: Just a five.

2248
02:32:14,641 --> 02:32:16,465
MATT: How much did you do, total?

2249
02:32:16,465 --> 02:32:18,654
MARISHA: 32, total.

2250
02:32:18,654 --> 02:32:27,862
MATT: Hold on. So as the duergar is currently held
aloft in this aquatic sphere, half-charred and

2251
02:32:27,862 --> 02:32:31,629
burnt with pieces of his friends floating in the
water around him, he hears through this kind of

2252
02:32:31,629 --> 02:32:36,822
warbling sound, "You ugly, you ugly," and he sees
everyone kind of step in the hallway clapping with

2253
02:32:36,822 --> 02:32:40,919
you, and he kind of looks around at himself, looks
at his situation... and eventually just gives up

2254
02:32:40,919 --> 02:32:44,497
and takes a big old gulp of water and drowns
inside the aquatic sphere.

2255
02:32:44,497 --> 02:32:45,475
(laughter)

2256
02:32:45,475 --> 02:32:47,497
SAM: Yes! I shamed him to death

2257
02:32:47,497 --> 02:32:49,311
ASHLEY: Amazing.

2258
02:32:49,311 --> 02:32:51,813
MARISHA: (laughs) What a terrible way to die.

2259
02:32:51,813 --> 02:32:57,023
MATT: Good news is, you guys royally screwed over
six duergar, one of which

2260
02:32:57,023 --> 02:32:58,588
you shamed him to death.

2261
02:32:58,588 --> 02:33:00,002
(laughter)

2262
02:33:00,002 --> 02:33:03,766
MATT: You have definitely, however, announced your
presence at the chamber.

2263
02:33:03,766 --> 02:33:13,384
LIAM: Vax spanks Tiberius on the tail and says,
get ready to deity! Going stealth.

2264
02:33:13,384 --> 02:33:16,851
MARISHA: I say-- I go, get on my back, get on my
back, and I piggyback him.

2265
02:33:16,851 --> 02:33:18,714
MATT: You transform?

2266
02:33:18,714 --> 02:33:20,258
ORION: I do.

2267
02:33:20,258 --> 02:33:22,268
MATT: No, Marisha, did you transform?

2268
02:33:22,268 --> 02:33:26,262
MARISHA: Well I'm piggybacking him, just now. I'm
literally just piggybacking Tiberius waiting.

2269
02:33:26,262 --> 02:33:27,878
MATT: Okay, so Tiberius, you leap onto her back.

2270
02:33:27,878 --> 02:33:31,366
ORION: Mm-hm, and I cast Alter Self, and I turn
to--

2271
02:33:31,366 --> 02:33:33,143
LIAM: Scanlan, Vex.

2272
02:33:33,143 --> 02:33:39,303
ASHLEY: I'm going to cast the thing on him.

2273
02:33:39,303 --> 02:33:48,319
MATT: Okay, so you cast Thaumaturgy on him to give
him a vocal emphasis, a roaring, booming voice. Do

2274
02:33:48,319 --> 02:33:50,405
you stay with him or do you move back with the
rest of the group?

2275
02:33:50,405 --> 02:33:55,929
MARISHA: Oh, oh, Pike Pike Pike Pike Pike. What
kind of animal would this god use? Would you know

2276
02:33:55,929 --> 02:34:01,274
what kind of animal the duergar would worship? Do
you know?

2277
02:34:01,274 --> 02:34:02,450
ORION: It's a religion check.

2278
02:34:02,450 --> 02:34:04,206
MATT: Religion check.

2279
02:34:04,206 --> 02:34:10,544
MARISHA: What kind of animals he might like? You
know, check out-- you know, animals.

2280
02:34:10,544 --> 02:34:14,996
ASHLEY: 14.

2281
02:34:14,996 --> 02:34:21,538
MATT: You have no idea. You know the deity exists,
you don't know of any sort of animal, beast or

2282
02:34:21,538 --> 02:34:24,712
creature symbolism that would befit a duergar
god.

2283
02:34:24,712 --> 02:34:26,162
ASHLEY: I have no idea.

2284
02:34:26,162 --> 02:34:33,072
MARISHA: I guess a scorpion, a scorpion sounds
good? Scorpion. Giant Scorpion.

2285
02:34:33,141 --> 02:34:40,248
MATT: Keyleth's form shifts. As you see a bunch of
arachnid-like legs sprawl out the side of her

2286
02:34:40,248 --> 02:34:45,682
torso, her form condenses into a dark, chitinous shell
as two giant claws form out the side of her body,

2287
02:34:45,755 --> 02:34:50,436
and a giant poison stinger curls up from behind.
Tiberius kind of holds on during the

2288
02:34:50,436 --> 02:34:51,608
transformation--

2289
02:34:51,608 --> 02:34:54,508
ASHLEY: I'm going to go back, because if they see
me, then they'll know something's fishy.

2290
02:34:54,508 --> 02:35:00,920
MATT: All right, the rest of you are here. So. You
feel this kind of divine energy cascade around

2291
02:35:00,920 --> 02:35:04,946
your throat. You can feel your vocal cords
themselves are temporarily infused with some sort

2292
02:35:04,946 --> 02:35:10,612
of divine presence. You've transformed yourself
now into the visage of this duergar deity.

2293
02:35:10,612 --> 02:35:13,760
Standing at probably a good-- what height are you
going at?

2294
02:35:13,760 --> 02:35:17,003
ORION: How tall are the--

2295
02:35:17,003 --> 02:35:22,091
MATT: The duergar are about four-and-a-half feet
tall.

2296
02:35:22,091 --> 02:35:23,619
ORION: So let's make him six feet tall.

2297
02:35:23,619 --> 02:35:25,893
MATT: All right, six-foot-tall duergar standing
there.

2298
02:35:25,893 --> 02:35:32,208
LAURA: The two of us get back by the other twin
door, and get ready to bust into that entrance.

2299
02:35:32,208 --> 02:35:34,765
SAM: I'm with them. We're the stealth party.

2300
02:35:34,765 --> 02:35:45,747
LIAM: I'm in fact nudging Grog away from this door
towards the front towards Tiberius. I don't know,

2301
02:35:45,747 --> 02:35:47,029
they're not that strong.

2302
02:35:47,029 --> 02:35:48,941
MATT: What are you doing? Grog says, "Which way,
which way do I go?"

2303
02:35:48,941 --> 02:35:52,199
LIAM: Vax kicks Grog in the butt and sends him
forward. Go help Tiberius!

2304
02:35:52,199 --> 02:35:54,654
MATT: "I'm walking back for you."

2305
02:35:54,654 --> 02:35:59,603
LAURA: Grog, don't do that. Not that far. Grog,
come back, because if they see him--

2306
02:35:59,603 --> 02:36:04,881
ORION: No, stay in the corner, Grog. Wait 'til I
say help me, and then come kill everything.

2307
02:36:04,881 --> 02:36:08,377
MATT: He looks like he's listening. Mostly.

2308
02:36:08,377 --> 02:36:09,589
(laughter)

2309
02:36:09,589 --> 02:36:11,887
MARISHA: Back him up. Back him up.

2310
02:36:11,887 --> 02:36:20,771
MATT: You hear shifting in the doorway from the
front where you guys are. What's the plan? What's

2311
02:36:20,771 --> 02:36:21,663
doing what?

2312
02:36:21,663 --> 02:36:23,033
SAM: Who's going in first?

2313
02:36:23,033 --> 02:36:27,462
ORION: Is this going to be the entrance where
we're going in?

2314
02:36:27,462 --> 02:36:29,267
LAURA: Yeah you bust in and be a god.

2315
02:36:29,267 --> 02:36:31,057
MARISHA: Oh, are we busting in?

2316
02:36:31,057 --> 02:36:36,072
LAURA: When you give it, we'll go in the other
way.

2317
02:36:36,072 --> 02:36:37,453
MARISHA: Fuck if I know.

2318
02:36:37,453 --> 02:36:39,505
ORION: That's your job. Bust the door open.

2319
02:36:39,505 --> 02:36:42,886
MATT: All right, go ahead and make an athletics
check.

2320
02:36:42,886 --> 02:36:49,215
LIAM: I'm simultaneously checking our door for--
no, I already did. It's unlocked, and untrapped.

2321
02:36:49,215 --> 02:36:50,612
Never mind.

2322
02:36:50,612 --> 02:36:56,451
MARISHA: Giant scorpion. Athletics. Plus my dex,
I'm assuming?

2323
02:36:56,451 --> 02:36:58,469
MATT: No, plus your strength.

2324
02:36:58,469 --> 02:37:01,320
MARISHA: Strength, that's pretty cool, though.
22.

2325
02:37:01,320 --> 02:37:02,511
MATT: A 22.

2326
02:37:02,511 --> 02:37:03,631
MARISHA: I rolled a 19.

2327
02:37:03,631 --> 02:37:07,909
MATT: All right, the doors splinter open. The
doors are actually broken off the hinges.

2328
02:37:07,909 --> 02:37:13,724
ORION: As that happens, I cast Light and I cast
Prestidigitation.

2329
02:37:13,724 --> 02:37:20,936
SAM: Concentrate. Don't cast too much shit.

2330
02:37:20,936 --> 02:37:26,568
ORION: I can't hear what's going on. I hear some
annoyances in the background as I cast

2331
02:37:26,568 --> 02:37:29,681
Prestidigitation to make my voice louder.

2332
02:37:29,681 --> 02:37:34,368
LAURA: No, she already did it. It's three times
louder than it normally would be.

2333
02:37:34,368 --> 02:37:36,413
ORION: Oh, shit.

2334
02:37:36,413 --> 02:37:38,924
MARISHA: So just keep focusing on your Light.

2335
02:37:38,924 --> 02:37:41,435
MATT: As you guys come bursting in--

2336
02:37:41,435 --> 02:37:42,466
LIAM: Holy shit.

2337
02:37:42,466 --> 02:37:44,175
LAURA: Yeah, there's a lot of them.

2338
02:37:44,175 --> 02:37:46,472
MARISHA: Maybe do some Prestidigitation where you
move shit around.

2339
02:37:46,472 --> 02:37:48,974
ASHLEY: Oh ho ho. What!

2340
02:37:48,974 --> 02:37:52,429
MARISHA: Oh! Hello, everybody.

2341
02:37:52,429 --> 02:37:55,862
LIAM and LAURA: (Grog voice) I would like to
rage.

2342
02:37:55,862 --> 02:37:59,029
LAURA: Oh, no. Basilisks!

2343
02:37:59,029 --> 02:38:00,484
LIAM: What?

2344
02:38:00,484 --> 02:38:01,928
LAURA: Those thingies!

2345
02:38:01,928 --> 02:38:05,851
MARISHA: Oh, that's right, they have those pet
basilisks. Remember?

2346
02:38:05,851 --> 02:38:12,782
MATT: So the doors burst open and you guys come
through. All of the duergar stand there with their

2347
02:38:12,811 --> 02:38:17,475
weapons at the ready. You can see in the back, on
this raised platform, where the cloth stops, there

2348
02:38:17,475 --> 02:38:22,827
is two thrones, at the top two duergar sitting on
the thrones at the ready. You can see two kind of

2349
02:38:22,827 --> 02:38:27,586
lizard-like creatures in the back on chained
leashes. However, all of the duergar that are

2350
02:38:27,586 --> 02:38:31,778
ready to strike as you burst through, take a step
back, looking extremely confused about what's

2351
02:38:31,778 --> 02:38:32,561
going on.

2352
02:38:32,561 --> 02:38:35,670
ORION: (shouts) Silence! All of you, silence!

2353
02:38:35,670 --> 02:38:37,398
SAM: We weren't talking.

2354
02:38:37,398 --> 02:38:41,410
ORION: Who knows who I am?

2355
02:38:41,410 --> 02:38:43,888
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2356
02:38:43,888 --> 02:38:46,156
MARISHA: Get it. Get it. Get it.

2357
02:38:46,156 --> 02:38:50,055
LIAM: Yep. Yep yep yep yep. Vax is quietly moving
along the back wall.

2358
02:38:50,055 --> 02:38:51,977
SAM: Our door is open?

2359
02:38:51,977 --> 02:38:53,475
LIAM: It is now.

2360
02:38:53,475 --> 02:38:55,499
LAURA: Yeah we're going to try to stealth in and
sneak attack them.

2361
02:38:55,499 --> 02:38:56,741
ORION: 16.

2362
02:38:56,741 --> 02:39:01,152
LAURA: Oh god. Oh god.

2363
02:39:01,152 --> 02:39:13,239
MATT: Okay. The duergar in the front take another
step back, looking both frightened and awed. The

2364
02:39:13,239 --> 02:39:16,928
one nearest to you takes his hammer and throws it to
the ground, and takes a knee.

2365
02:39:16,928 --> 02:39:25,462
ORION: Well, it looks like there's one saved soul
at this point in time.

2366
02:39:25,462 --> 02:39:30,223
MATT: At which point two of the other ones nearby
kind of look at each other and look back at the

2367
02:39:30,223 --> 02:39:35,390
one who's on on the ground. They put their hammers
down, and they kneel as well. At which point, in

2368
02:39:35,436 --> 02:39:41,109
the back, you see the two throned figures stand up.
One of which you can barely see in the dim light

2369
02:39:41,109 --> 02:39:46,308
outside of your Light spell that's currently
gleaming above you. This long,

2370
02:39:46,308 --> 02:39:53,623
almost-touching-the-floor black, braided beard
that drags right over this heavy-set plate of

2371
02:39:53,623 --> 02:40:02,275
jagged black iron metal. A giant sword in his hand.
"You're kneeling below this false idol."

2372
02:40:02,275 --> 02:40:05,169
ORION: Silence!

2373
02:40:05,169 --> 02:40:06,574
MATT: "This imposter!"

2374
02:40:06,574 --> 02:40:10,596
ORION: As I cast-- As I say silence, I blow a big
plume of fire out of my mouth,

2375
02:40:10,596 --> 02:40:12,211
and I cast Control Flames.

2376
02:40:12,211 --> 02:40:16,171
MATT: So the light (pff).

2377
02:40:16,171 --> 02:40:20,440
ORION: I don't cast Control Flames. I just do the
Fireball for effect. I don't do Control Flames,

2378
02:40:20,440 --> 02:40:22,470
because that's a concentration spell.

2379
02:40:22,470 --> 02:40:25,326
MATT: All right, so you do Fireball. Where are you
casting Fireball? Or just doing it to do it?

2380
02:40:25,326 --> 02:40:26,710
ORION: Just (fwoosh).

2381
02:40:26,710 --> 02:40:29,600
MATT: Plume of flame. Roll an intimidation check.

2382
02:40:29,652 --> 02:40:32,242
TALIESIN: You guys, what are you doing right now?

2383
02:40:32,242 --> 02:40:36,792
LIAM: I'm moving along the back wall. I want that
illithid.

2384
02:40:36,792 --> 02:40:38,102
ORION: 18.

2385
02:40:38,102 --> 02:40:41,230
MATT: Okay. Make a stealth check. Who else is
going in there with him?

2386
02:40:41,230 --> 02:40:45,041
LAURA: I go in and stand at the walls next to the
door.

2387
02:40:45,041 --> 02:40:47,132
LIAM: 32.

2388
02:40:47,132 --> 02:40:49,358
MATT: Okay, your stealth roll?

2389
02:40:49,358 --> 02:40:55,706
ASHLEY: I'm so stressed.

2390
02:40:55,706 --> 02:40:58,649
MARISHA: I know! I feel like I'm going to have a
heart attack.

2391
02:40:58,649 --> 02:41:00,523
MATT: So you rolled a--

2392
02:41:00,523 --> 02:41:01,599
ORION: 18.

2393
02:41:01,599 --> 02:41:05,187
MATT: Okay, you can see this figure-- which you
are gathering at this point is probably King

2394
02:41:05,187 --> 02:41:10,956
Murghol-- still holding his sword aloft, looks
back towards his wife who's sitting in the throne

2395
02:41:10,956 --> 02:41:14,512
next to him, who is just standing up kind of
confused.

2396
02:41:14,512 --> 02:41:22,855
ORION: That's right, boy. I am Laduguer! You know,
and you know your deeds as

2397
02:41:22,855 --> 02:41:27,524
of late might upset my rest.

2398
02:41:27,524 --> 02:41:31,842
MATT: All of the duergar are now looking over
their shoulders back towards the king and watching

2399
02:41:31,842 --> 02:41:33,621
this transpire between the two of you.

2400
02:41:33,621 --> 02:41:36,396
ORION: (shouts) All of you, lay down your arms!

2401
02:41:36,396 --> 02:41:37,755
LAURA: 32.

2402
02:41:37,755 --> 02:41:40,734
MATT: 32. You're moving in, everyone else staying
in the hallway?

2403
02:41:40,734 --> 02:41:46,656
ASHLEY: I'm not moving. I'm like this!

2404
02:41:46,656 --> 02:41:53,501
MATT: As you guys push in further and further, the
group that are kneeling move back in sheer fear

2405
02:41:53,501 --> 02:42:00,191
and horror. At which point the king takes a step
down off of the throne area onto the next

2406
02:42:00,191 --> 02:42:09,132
platform, weapons still at his side and says,
"Men, I've trained you. I've raised you. I've fed

2407
02:42:09,132 --> 02:42:11,248
"you and I've kept you alive."

2408
02:42:11,248 --> 02:42:17,427
ORION: And I don't care for you to finish that
sentence! I cast Fireball. Right fucking-- Right

2409
02:42:17,427 --> 02:42:18,595
on him.

2410
02:42:18,595 --> 02:42:21,663
SAM: That's an attack right there.

2411
02:42:21,663 --> 02:42:23,192
ORION: Of course it is!

2412
02:42:23,192 --> 02:42:34,764
MATT: So the blast hits him and a 20-foot radius
that will grab everything in that radius.

2413
02:42:34,764 --> 02:42:40,721
Including you. So go ahead and roll damage. 8d6.

2414
02:42:40,721 --> 02:42:42,201
LIAM: It's all right.

2415
02:42:42,201 --> 02:42:43,624
MARISHA: 8d6.

2416
02:42:43,624 --> 02:42:49,524
LIAM: Heal me, Pike, heal me. Heal me in three
minutes, heal me. This is gonna hurt. This is

2417
02:42:49,524 --> 02:42:50,996
gonna sting.

2418
02:42:50,996 --> 02:42:57,741
MARISHA: Oh, god damn. Come on, you got this.
You got this, Vax.

2419
02:42:57,741 --> 02:42:59,827
SAM: You want it to be a lot, but not too much.

2420
02:42:59,827 --> 02:43:01,794
(laughter)

2421
02:43:01,794 --> 02:43:03,913
LIAM: A little less than 55.

2422
02:43:03,913 --> 02:43:05,326
ORION: Uh, 25.

2423
02:43:05,326 --> 02:43:06,749
MATT: 25, okay.

2424
02:43:06,749 --> 02:43:08,262
ORION: Oh, I'm sorry, 30.

2425
02:43:08,262 --> 02:43:13,365
MATT: Okay, good. So it explodes around them. You
see all of them kind of shield themselves from the

2426
02:43:13,365 --> 02:43:15,438
blast of flame. As it spreads out--

2427
02:43:15,438 --> 02:43:18,591
LIAM: Wait, I'm doing the rogue thing that I can't
remember the name for.

2428
02:43:18,591 --> 02:43:20,059
LAURA and MARISHA: Uncanny Dodge?

2429
02:43:20,059 --> 02:43:21,535
LIAM: No, it's something else.

2430
02:43:21,535 --> 02:43:22,838
ORION: Quickly. Quickly.

2431
02:43:22,838 --> 02:43:28,079
MATT: So while you're looking that up-- The
duergar brace themselves and they have an innate

2432
02:43:28,079 --> 02:43:31,056
natural resistance against things magical in
nature.

2433
02:43:31,056 --> 02:43:32,632
LIAM: Evasion!

2434
02:43:32,632 --> 02:43:36,773
MATT: So they all take the brunt of the damage,
however, it does not do as much as you hoped to

2435
02:43:36,773 --> 02:43:42,841
the group. All of them look hurt, but definitely
not taken out of the fight. The two lizard

2436
02:43:42,841 --> 02:43:47,019
creatures you now have a better look at, you do
see it's familiar. They have numerous sets of

2437
02:43:47,019 --> 02:43:53,377
legs, and though the chains hold them at bay, both
of them glance up instinctually. I want you,

2438
02:43:53,423 --> 02:43:59,540
Tiberius, to make two constitution saving throws.

2439
02:43:59,540 --> 02:44:00,681
SAM: Traps.

2440
02:44:00,681 --> 02:44:01,781
ORION: Yes.

2441
02:44:01,781 --> 02:44:10,968
LIAM: DM. Evasion, if I make a success I get
half-damage, if I fail I get-- If I fail, I get

2442
02:44:10,968 --> 02:44:15,116
half-damage, if I succeed I get no damage. I think
I failed. I got a nine.

2443
02:44:15,116 --> 02:44:20,955
MATT: Yeah you take half-damage. So you take the--
What was the total damage on your Fireball? So you

2444
02:44:20,955 --> 02:44:27,447
take 15 points of fire damage. So as you glance
about the room now, you look over and both of

2445
02:44:27,447 --> 02:44:30,939
these lizard creatures kind of look towards you.
You kind of look back and forth-- there's a

2446
02:44:30,939 --> 02:44:40,567
slight gleam in their eye. Suddenly you feel your
form begin to tighten up, instant. You are

2447
02:44:40,567 --> 02:44:46,621
considered restrained, which means you are at
disadvantage to all your attack rolls and ability

2448
02:44:46,621 --> 02:44:48,048
checks for right now.

2449
02:44:48,048 --> 02:44:52,277
ORION: Hold on, I still have a bonus attack I can
do before that happens, correct?

2450
02:44:52,277 --> 02:44:55,002
MATT: No, this is as it's happening. Your turn is
still happening.

2451
02:44:55,002 --> 02:44:56,014
ORION: I got it.

2452
02:44:56,014 --> 02:44:59,322
MATT: This is all kind of a fluid moment. Things
happen as they happen until initiative is being

2453
02:44:59,386 --> 02:45:03,528
rolled, which is now. So everyone roll
initiative.

2454
02:45:03,528 --> 02:45:05,344
MARISHA: Sneaky sneaky.

2455
02:45:05,344 --> 02:45:10,597
LAURA: Oh, great.

2456
02:45:10,597 --> 02:45:23,547
MATT: All right, so, 25 to 20?

2457
02:45:23,547 --> 02:45:25,427
SAM: Natural 20.

2458
02:45:25,427 --> 02:45:26,717
MATT: Plus your--

2459
02:45:26,717 --> 02:45:27,679
SAM: Nothing.

2460
02:45:27,679 --> 02:45:28,980
MATT: Plus nothing for dex. Okay.

2461
02:45:28,980 --> 02:45:31,499
SAM: Oh, for dex. Plus nothing.

2462
02:45:31,499 --> 02:45:33,468
MATT: Okay, so 25 to 20?

2463
02:45:33,468 --> 02:45:34,355
TALIESIN: 23.

2464
02:45:34,355 --> 02:45:35,549
LIAM: 21.

2465
02:45:35,549 --> 02:45:37,020
MATT: 21, all right, all right.

2466
02:45:37,020 --> 02:45:40,118
TALIESIN: Yeah. Sneak attack.

2467
02:45:40,118 --> 02:45:49,349
MATT: All righty, 20 to 15?

2468
02:45:49,349 --> 02:45:51,066
LAURA: 19.

2469
02:45:51,066 --> 02:45:52,820
ORION: 17.

2470
02:46:00,620 --> 02:46:05,471
MATT: All right, 15 to ten?

2471
02:46:05,471 --> 02:46:08,061
MARISHA: I'm nine.

2472
02:46:08,061 --> 02:46:13,701
ASHLEY: Five. Not to brag.

2473
02:46:13,701 --> 02:46:18,957
MARISHA: (laughs) Big number five.

2474
02:46:18,957 --> 02:46:22,102
MATT: All right.

2475
02:46:27,892 --> 02:46:33,215
MARISHA: I just noticed your shirt. It's really
great.

2476
02:46:36,406 --> 02:46:40,563
SAM: Guys, tune in every week for this kind of
intense action.

2477
02:46:40,563 --> 02:46:43,933
LAURA: Unless we're all dead next week. In which
case--

2478
02:46:43,933 --> 02:46:47,437
LIAM: -- Mama put the coins on my eyes.

2479
02:46:47,437 --> 02:46:52,666
MATT: All right, that brings us to top of the
round. Percy, you're up.

2480
02:46:52,666 --> 02:46:58,386
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold off until-- I'm
actually going to delay my turn until post-Pike.

2481
02:46:58,386 --> 02:47:03,771
ORION: Can I still yell out shit while this is
happening? Even though it isn't my turn?

2482
02:47:03,771 --> 02:47:06,766
MATT: I mean, you can yell like one thing.

2483
02:47:06,766 --> 02:47:09,953
TALIESIN: I'm loud and I've got range, so I'm
going to let the room fill,

2484
02:47:09,953 --> 02:47:14,290
and then I'm going to come in and get some.

2485
02:47:14,290 --> 02:47:19,620
ORION: As this is all going down, I'm going to
yell, those who want to live, throw down your

2486
02:47:19,620 --> 02:47:22,098
arms. That's what I do.

2487
02:47:22,098 --> 02:47:27,097
MATT: Okay. That brings us back to the top. Vax,
you're up.

2488
02:47:27,097 --> 02:47:33,109
LIAM: Okay, I use my bonus action to click my
boots of haste together. And I tap-dance over to

2489
02:47:33,109 --> 02:47:37,932
the illithid, and I'm going to use two daggers to
stab him in his eyeballs.

2490
02:47:37,932 --> 02:47:39,439
MATT: Okay.

2491
02:47:39,439 --> 02:47:41,428
LIAM: First one hits, it's 18.

2492
02:47:41,428 --> 02:47:44,348
MATT: It is a critical because it does not see you
and has not acted yet this combat.

2493
02:47:44,348 --> 02:47:55,088
LIAM: Yeah it is. So I just take my keen dagger
and I shove it in his eyeball. 1d4 is two, plus--

2494
02:47:55,088 --> 02:47:58,570
MARISHA: Feel like I'm going to have a heart
attack.

2495
02:47:58,570 --> 02:48:01,729
TALIESIN: We're going to be fine. It's nothing we
can't handle.

2496
02:48:01,729 --> 02:48:05,011
MARISHA: Nothing we can't handle.

2497
02:48:05,011 --> 02:48:13,727
LIAM: 19, 28, plus 36 is the first dagger into his
eyeball.

2498
02:48:13,727 --> 02:48:14,889
MATT: Okay.

2499
02:48:14,889 --> 02:48:21,727
LIAM: Second dagger also hits for a little less,
for seven points of fire

2500
02:48:21,727 --> 02:48:23,814
damage in his other eyeball.

2501
02:48:23,814 --> 02:48:29,706
MATT: All right. Gotcha. So the first one actually
jams into one of its eyes. It didn't even see you,

2502
02:48:29,706 --> 02:48:34,310
it recoils back, slapping your hand back out of
the way. The other dagger strikes and just gleans

2503
02:48:34,310 --> 02:48:37,515
off its shoulder. However, it turns around with
its other eye and

2504
02:48:37,515 --> 02:48:39,643
it definitely knows you're there.

2505
02:48:39,643 --> 02:48:43,373
LIAM: I'd like to circulate my hands to kind of
carve out the eyeball area.

2506
02:48:43,373 --> 02:48:44,949
(laughter)

2507
02:48:44,949 --> 02:48:46,590
MATT: No, it pushed you off.

2508
02:48:46,590 --> 02:48:48,719
LIAM: Yeah, okay, okay, it's all right.

2509
02:48:48,719 --> 02:48:52,769
MATT: All right. That brings us to Grog.

2510
02:48:52,769 --> 02:48:55,860
SAM: (Grog voice) I would like to rage.

2511
02:48:55,860 --> 02:48:59,393
LIAM: (Grog voice) I would like to go to a whore
house.

2512
02:48:59,393 --> 02:49:04,435
MATT: He goes into a rage. And Grog is going to go
ahead and take his axe with the chain on it and

2513
02:49:04,435 --> 02:49:11,572
throw it toward the first duergar he sees, which
is right here. Throws it. All right, that is a--

2514
02:49:11,572 --> 02:49:16,556
That's going to miss. He rolled a four. Swings
past. He's going to make an athletics check to see

2515
02:49:16,556 --> 02:49:19,941
if he can bring it back. That he succeeds. So he
throws the axe. It swings past the duergar, clangs

2516
02:49:19,941 --> 02:49:24,616
to the ground, uses his chain, he yanks it back,
catches it in his hand. His turn is spent,

2517
02:49:24,616 --> 02:49:26,828
however. Next up is Scanlan.

2518
02:49:26,828 --> 02:49:34,088
SAM: I step into the room, lining myself up with
those two pig, creature, beast things. In a line.

2519
02:49:34,088 --> 02:49:37,036
Yeah. Can I also catch the king or no?

2520
02:49:37,036 --> 02:49:39,903
MATT: No, it has to be a line. It has to go
straight.

2521
02:49:39,903 --> 02:49:44,026
SAM: Going for the guys. I don't want to scald
you. You're already hurting. I'm going to go

2522
02:49:44,026 --> 02:49:48,881
straight across the piggies and make them squeal
with Lightning.

2523
02:49:48,881 --> 02:49:52,436
MATT: All right. At the start of your turn--

2524
02:49:52,436 --> 02:49:54,422
SAM: Oh shit, there's a trap.

2525
02:49:54,422 --> 02:49:58,038
MATT: No, at the start of your turn you come up
and the creature looks over and you guys make eye

2526
02:49:58,038 --> 02:50:01,932
contact. You weren't averting your gaze. Go ahead
and make a constitution save.

2527
02:50:01,932 --> 02:50:09,017
LIAM: Saving throw, saving throw. Come on,
Scanlan, you lucky motherfucker! Roll high.

2528
02:50:09,017 --> 02:50:11,419
SAM: 17, plus what?

2529
02:50:11,419 --> 02:50:12,806
MATT: Plus your constitution modifier.

2530
02:50:12,806 --> 02:50:13,746
SAM: 19.

2531
02:50:13,746 --> 02:50:16,587
MATT: All right, so, as it glances over at you,
there's a shine in its eye, and you feel all of a

2532
02:50:16,587 --> 02:50:20,593
sudden your form, for a second, tense, and you
shrug off the effect, untouched by it. Now, go

2533
02:50:20,593 --> 02:50:22,758
ahead and take your turn.

2534
02:50:22,758 --> 02:50:28,552
SAM: I cast Lightning on the two beasts. 
In a straight line.

2535
02:50:28,552 --> 02:50:30,914
MATT: Okay, so you pull back and you unleash a
lightning bolt.

2536
02:50:30,914 --> 02:50:32,673
It goes streaking across the room.

2537
02:50:32,673 --> 02:50:34,971
SAM: If I can get the king, I'll try.

2538
02:50:34,971 --> 02:50:37,062
MATT: Unfortunately, he's just out of the line
array, but it does streak across and blast both of

2539
02:50:37,062 --> 02:50:41,403
these now visibly basilisks in front of you.

2540
02:50:41,403 --> 02:50:43,662
You hit automatically. Just go ahead and
roll damage.

2541
02:50:43,662 --> 02:50:44,953
(laughter)

2542
02:50:44,953 --> 02:50:47,629
MARISHA: Oh sweet, sweet dice rolls.

2543
02:50:47,629 --> 02:50:49,061
LIAM: Let it rain!

2544
02:50:49,061 --> 02:50:51,352
MARISHA: Let it rain d6s from the sky!

2545
02:50:51,352 --> 02:50:55,005
SAM: 29.

2546
02:50:55,005 --> 02:51:03,010
MATT: 29. One fails its saving throw, one makes
it. So 29 damage to one, and 14 to the other.

2547
02:51:03,010 --> 02:51:07,819
SAM: And then, for bonus action, I inspire Vax
with a little ditty.

2548
02:51:09,585 --> 02:51:11,127
MATT: All right.

2549
02:51:11,127 --> 02:51:18,259
SAM: (sings) I want to sing a song of inspiration,
of inspiration!

2550
02:51:18,259 --> 02:51:20,103
(laughter)

2551
02:51:20,103 --> 02:51:26,503
MATT: All righty, that's it. That ends Scanlan's
turn. King Murghol's turn, now. King Murghol is

2552
02:51:26,503 --> 02:51:33,319
going to-- It sees this blast of lightning streak
past now, as it blasts, just barely passing in

2553
02:51:33,319 --> 02:51:38,507
front of it, hitting both of his pet basilisks.
Now seeing that there's, like, a full army between

2554
02:51:38,507 --> 02:51:44,658
himself and the current intruders, one of which is
visibly stiffening, he glances over at this tiny

2555
02:51:44,658 --> 02:51:50,586
gnome individual, who now gave loose to this bolt
of energy. Grabs his blade with both hands and

2556
02:51:50,586 --> 02:51:55,484
goes running towards you with an angry-- but he
uses a bonus action, quickly, to pull out a vial,

2557
02:51:55,484 --> 02:52:00,314
pop a cork, chug it, shatter the glass on the
ground. As he does, you can see his arms actually

2558
02:52:00,314 --> 02:52:04,374
billow and grow extremely strong and thick with
muscle.

2559
02:52:04,374 --> 02:52:06,169
MARISHA and LAURA: What color was the vial?

2560
02:52:06,169 --> 02:52:08,331
MATT: This was purplish in color.

2561
02:52:08,331 --> 02:52:18,780
He then runs forward. And is going to take
his turn, swinging at Scanlan.

2562
02:52:18,780 --> 02:52:26,035
SAM: As he does, I sing (sings) Dodge that sexy
attack-oh white boy.

2563
02:52:26,035 --> 02:52:28,329
(laughter)

2564
02:52:28,329 --> 02:52:34,189
SAM: I sing my-- what is it called?
Counter-- Cutting Word-- no, yes, what? Cutting

2565
02:52:34,189 --> 02:52:40,305
Words! And I try to distract him as he's attacking
me. What is that, a d8?

2566
02:52:40,305 --> 02:52:41,929
MATT: A d8 off of his first attack.

2567
02:52:41,929 --> 02:52:44,449
SAM: Five.

2568
02:52:44,449 --> 02:52:48,947
MATT: Five. Okay, well, he rolled a 20, which
brings it down, oh, a total of 20, which brings it

2569
02:52:48,947 --> 02:52:50,481
down to 15. What's your armor class?

2570
02:52:50,481 --> 02:52:51,841
SAM: 14.

2571
02:52:51,841 --> 02:53:00,586
MATT: Oh. Second strike is a 13. Third strike is a
12. Wow, he just can't hit at all this turn. But,

2572
02:53:00,586 --> 02:53:05,753
however, the one strike he does get on you, the
sword comes down, streaks across the front of you,

2573
02:53:05,753 --> 02:53:13,095
and as you're finishing your last, final note of
that song, you take 18 points of slashing damage.

2574
02:53:13,095 --> 02:53:15,179
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

2575
02:53:15,179 --> 02:53:16,809
ASHLEY: Where you at?

2576
02:53:16,809 --> 02:53:17,801
SAM: I'm fine.

2577
02:53:17,801 --> 02:53:18,755
ASHLEY: Where are you at?

2578
02:53:18,755 --> 02:53:20,334
SAM: I'm fine. I've got more than him.

2579
02:53:20,334 --> 02:53:24,152
MATT: That ends his turn. This brings us back to
Vex!

2580
02:53:24,152 --> 02:53:30,257
LAURA: That's me! I cast Hunter's Mark! Actually,
I just transfer it, because the other one died.

2581
02:53:30,257 --> 02:53:32,689
I transfer it to the king.

2582
02:53:32,689 --> 02:53:39,430
And then I cast-- First I want to move
Trinket over and-- oh no, I can only move

2583
02:53:39,430 --> 02:53:46,446
Trinket. Okay, first I'm gonna cast Conjure
Barrage. It's a 60-foot cone.

2584
02:53:46,446 --> 02:53:49,449
So I want to see how many of them I can get.

2585
02:53:49,449 --> 02:53:55,243
MATT: You can, you can get-- let's see. 
That'll get everybody.

2586
02:53:55,243 --> 02:53:59,271
LAURA: Can I angle it so I don't hit my buddies?

2587
02:53:59,271 --> 02:54:02,544
MATT: You can angle it in a way that will-- well,
if you wanna get the king in it, you're going to

2588
02:54:02,544 --> 02:54:06,232
hit these two here. And Grog.

2589
02:54:06,232 --> 02:54:07,977
LAURA: All right, I'll hit them.

2590
02:54:07,977 --> 02:54:11,141
MATT: Okay, so, you will be able to hit everything
in that row. So go for it.

2591
02:54:11,218 --> 02:54:12,947
How does the effect on that work?

2592
02:54:13,367 --> 02:54:17,885
LAURA: I roll 3d8.

2593
02:54:17,885 --> 02:54:19,773
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll 3d8.

2594
02:54:19,773 --> 02:54:30,197
LAURA: That was on a corner. Oh good! 17.

2595
02:54:30,197 --> 02:54:33,175
MATT: 17, okay. And what's the effect on the
spell, like what do they roll against?

2596
02:54:33,175 --> 02:54:35,402
LAURA: They roll a dexterity saving throw.

2597
02:54:35,402 --> 02:54:41,510
MATT: Dexterity saving throw. King makes his, with
a 20. So he takes half-damage for it,

2598
02:54:41,510 --> 02:54:42,677
or no damage?

2599
02:54:42,677 --> 02:54:45,041
LAURA: Half as much, yeah.

2600
02:54:45,041 --> 02:54:51,116
MATT: Okay, so what was the total again? It was--
What was the total originally? It was-- what was

2601
02:54:51,116 --> 02:54:51,849
the total?

2602
02:54:51,849 --> 02:54:53,440
LAURA: The total? Was 17.

2603
02:54:53,440 --> 02:54:56,655
MATT: 17. Okay, so that is eight damage to the
king.

2604
02:54:56,655 --> 02:54:57,974
LAURA: Plus a Hunter's Mark.

2605
02:54:57,974 --> 02:55:00,675
MATT: Right, so roll the additional one on that.

2606
02:55:00,675 --> 02:55:02,493
LAURA: Four.

2607
02:55:02,493 --> 02:55:09,193
MATT: Four, gotcha. All right. The basilisk also
does not make its save. What's the DC on this?

2608
02:55:09,193 --> 02:55:12,235
LAURA: DC. What do you mean?

2609
02:55:12,235 --> 02:55:13,773
MATT: Your spell DC. At the top of your spell
page.

2610
02:55:13,773 --> 02:55:15,599
LAURA: Yes. It's 14.

2611
02:55:15,599 --> 02:55:16,331
MATT: 14.

2612
02:55:16,331 --> 02:55:18,012
LAURA: Oh, I did get a-- I didn't add my spell
attack bonus! Should I have done that?

2613
02:55:18,012 --> 02:55:20,692
MATT: No, that's just to hit something with a
spell.

2614
02:55:20,692 --> 02:55:21,958
LAURA: Okay, cool.

2615
02:55:21,958 --> 02:55:30,165
MATT: All right, so basilisk in front makes it, so
it takes the eight damage. Okay, the rest of the

2616
02:55:30,165 --> 02:55:41,758
duergar, they do make their saves, they take half
damage. However, with the spray of arrows that

2617
02:55:41,758 --> 02:55:52,411
comes flying out of the front of your bow, you
manage to take out five duergar in one swipe. The

2618
02:55:52,411 --> 02:55:57,910
others ones remain, damaged but still standing.
Also, now dexterity saving throw for you,

2619
02:55:57,910 --> 02:56:02,408
Tiberius, and Grog.

2620
02:56:02,408 --> 02:56:03,792
MARISHA: Natural 20.

2621
02:56:03,792 --> 02:56:05,714
ORION: 19.

2622
02:56:05,714 --> 02:56:08,916
MATT: Nice. So both you guys take eight damage.
Grog fails, Grog takes 17.

2623
02:56:08,916 --> 02:56:10,766
LAURA: I'm sorry, Grog.

2624
02:56:10,766 --> 02:56:15,788
MATT: "It's all right." All right, Vex, is that
the end of your turn?

2625
02:56:15,788 --> 02:56:24,294
LAURA: Oh, I move Trinket in, and I want to-- If I
can get him to illithid, I want to get Trinket

2626
02:56:24,294 --> 02:56:31,046
close, like kind of behind the queen. No, no, I
want to get him near. That way he can flank.

2627
02:56:31,046 --> 02:56:38,355
MATT: Okay, all right. That ends your turn. 
It is now Lady Kima's turn.

2628
02:56:38,355 --> 02:56:39,998
SAM: Ooh, I forgot about her.

2629
02:56:39,998 --> 02:56:45,748
MATT: Kima rushes in angrily. She has to make a
saving throw. Succeeds against the basilisk, as it

2630
02:56:45,748 --> 02:56:54,020
glances past. Rushes forward, in combat with both
King Murghol and the basilisk. However, as she

2631
02:56:54,020 --> 02:56:58,541
goes in for King Murghol, screaming, the blade of
the greatsword arcing across the air with a divine

2632
02:56:58,541 --> 02:57:05,222
glowing energy, you see it aiming for the king,
but then looks to her side and sees this dangerous

2633
02:57:05,222 --> 02:57:09,198
lizard creature, recognizing it in a moment, she
changes her trajectory and swings next to the

2634
02:57:09,198 --> 02:57:21,355
lizard with her first strike. That is a-- that
hits. And that strike does just enough damage. She

2635
02:57:21,355 --> 02:57:27,225
cleaves that basilisk in two with her first
strike. With her first strike, using the inertia,

2636
02:57:27,225 --> 02:57:30,515
she turns around and strikes at King Murghol.

2637
02:57:31,190 --> 02:57:35,658
However, King Murghol, seeing her come
forward, takes his sword up and manages to parry

2638
02:57:35,658 --> 02:57:39,587
hers to the side. Both of them lock for a second
as he steps into her and kind of glares into her

2639
02:57:39,587 --> 02:57:44,967
face. "Oh, you're supposed to be downstairs for
playtime." Pushes her off with his blade..

2640
02:57:44,967 --> 02:57:52,565
MARISHA: Playtime? I don't-- (laughs) I know, all
the ladies are like 'ew'.

2641
02:57:52,565 --> 02:57:59,575
MATT: That brings us to Queen Ulara's turn. Queen
Ulara is now standing over there with Trinket

2642
02:57:59,575 --> 02:58:05,741
towards her back. As she instinctually does this,
she goes ahead and reaches up, places her hand on

2643
02:58:05,741 --> 02:58:09,643
the front of her robes. You can see this duergar
woman with kind of long, reddish hair that she's

2644
02:58:09,643 --> 02:58:14,026
let flow to the back, to the small of her back.
She stands up out of the throne. As she puts her

2645
02:58:14,026 --> 02:58:20,290
hand on her chest, her form shimmers, much like
you saw earlier on Tiberius, in your earlier

2646
02:58:20,290 --> 02:58:26,577
battle. She moves back to there.

2647
02:58:26,577 --> 02:58:30,200
ORION: As she does that, I try to Counterspell
it.

2648
02:58:30,200 --> 02:58:32,002
MATT: That's a reaction?

2649
02:58:32,002 --> 02:58:33,004
ORION: Yep.

2650
02:58:33,004 --> 02:58:35,900
MATT: Okay. So let's go ahead and do the contested
roll.

2651
02:58:35,900 --> 02:58:37,901
ORION: Contested roll.

2652
02:58:37,901 --> 02:58:45,231
SAM: That was almost the name of this show. Not as
catchy.

2653
02:58:45,231 --> 02:58:49,566
ORION: DC equals ten plus the spell's level.

2654
02:58:49,566 --> 02:58:55,758
MATT: Okay. So the DC is 12. Go ahead and you roll
that.

2655
02:58:55,758 --> 02:59:01,520
ORION: DC is 13. It's a third-level spell. Right?

2656
02:59:01,520 --> 02:59:03,078
MATT: Blur is second-level.

2657
02:59:03,078 --> 02:59:06,128
ORION: Oh, I thought Counter-- Okay, I see.

2658
02:59:06,128 --> 02:59:16,022
MATT: Yes. So, Counterspell. Go ahead and-- Oh--
interrupt a creature in process of casting a

2659
02:59:16,022 --> 02:59:22,198
spell. If the creature is casting a spell-- third
level or lower, it fails and has no effect. So,

2660
02:59:22,198 --> 02:59:31,924
yeah, it just counters it entirely. So, the-- her
form begins to shimmer for a second. All of a

2661
02:59:31,924 --> 02:59:39,091
sudden, Tiberius, your attempt to go ahead and
counter the spell, that burst of energy you're

2662
02:59:39,091 --> 02:59:41,734
trying to put through the Blur vanishes. She looks
back at you.

2663
02:59:41,734 --> 02:59:44,354
ORION: What do you think you're doing, lass?

2664
02:59:44,354 --> 02:59:46,868
SAM: You still trying to be a god?

2665
02:59:46,868 --> 02:59:48,862
ORION: I'm in that form still.

2666
02:59:48,862 --> 02:59:50,114
(laughter)

2667
02:59:50,114 --> 02:59:54,581
MATT: Yeah. So with her sorcery points expended on
that quick cast, she turns around for her main

2668
02:59:54,581 --> 03:00:00,550
action, puts out her fingers, and you see these
blasts of blue energy begin to rocket out from her

2669
03:00:00,550 --> 03:00:05,017
fingertips, across the room, in what is a Chain
Lightning.

2670
03:00:05,017 --> 03:00:08,569
LIAM: Shit. He's got the iPhone out.

2671
03:00:08,569 --> 03:00:19,650
MATT: So, this'll be towards-- actually, this'd be
towards you, Vex, Kima, and Scanlan.

2672
03:00:19,650 --> 03:00:21,047
LAURA: All right.

2673
03:00:21,047 --> 03:00:22,345
LIAM: Did you say Vex or Vax?

2674
03:00:22,345 --> 03:00:26,212
MATT: Yeah, Vex and Vax, both of you.

2675
03:00:26,212 --> 03:00:28,525
LAURA: Wait, you're all the way over there.

2676
03:00:28,525 --> 03:00:30,734
SAM: Yeah, you're all the way over somewhere else,
right?

2677
03:00:30,734 --> 03:00:41,325
MATT: Over there, yeah. Chain Lightning, man. It's
a bitch. All right. All right, so. Vax, go ahead

2678
03:00:41,325 --> 03:00:43,485
and make a dexterity saving throw.

2679
03:00:43,485 --> 03:00:49,774
LIAM: Not good. Seven.

2680
03:00:49,774 --> 03:00:52,032
MATT: Seven, all right.

2681
03:00:52,032 --> 03:00:56,560
LIAM: Can I use Evasion, or-- Uncanny Dodge or
Evasion?

2682
03:00:56,560 --> 03:00:56,810
SAM: I gave you some dice. I gave you, I gave you
some dice.

2683
03:00:56,810 --> 03:00:58,227
LIAM: You did give me some dice.

2684
03:00:58,227 --> 03:01:00,006
SAM: It's not going to be enough, though.

2685
03:01:00,006 --> 03:01:04,257
LIAM: So now I'm at 13, but can I use Evasion or
Uncanny Dodge? Evasion is for area effects,

2686
03:01:04,257 --> 03:01:05,231
Uncanny Dodge is--

2687
03:01:05,231 --> 03:01:09,466
MATT: Well, you've already used one for the area
effect, the other one reduces the damage by half.

2688
03:01:09,466 --> 03:01:10,193
LIAM: All right, Uncanny Dodge.

2689
03:01:10,193 --> 03:01:11,769
MATT: Okay, so you're reducing the damage by
half?

2690
03:01:11,769 --> 03:01:12,590
LIAM: Yeah.

2691
03:01:12,590 --> 03:01:19,579
MATT: Okay, so instead, you take 18 points of
lightning damage. However, both Vex and Scanlan

2692
03:01:19,579 --> 03:01:26,243
and Kima all have to make dexterity saving throws
as well. She makes hers.

2693
03:01:26,243 --> 03:01:33,091
SAM: Not great. 14. I have no dexterity.

2694
03:01:33,091 --> 03:01:34,515
LAURA: 16.

2695
03:01:34,515 --> 03:01:40,576
MATT: 16, okay. So you took, was it 18 lightning
damage, I said?

2696
03:01:40,576 --> 03:01:44,294
LIAM: Oh, I didn't add any dexterity. I add a 9 to
what I got, which means I'm at 22.

2697
03:01:44,294 --> 03:01:50,556
MATT: Just, you mean, your dexterity modifier? 22?
Okay, then you would've taken half damage, make it

2698
03:01:50,556 --> 03:01:55,384
quarter damage, so you take half of that even. So
keep that in mind when you make your dexterity

2699
03:01:55,384 --> 03:02:01,868
saving throw. So, that would give you total how
much damage? So, it was 18 you took, right?

2700
03:02:01,868 --> 03:02:06,485
LIAM: Yeah, and we halved it to nine. Five?

2701
03:02:06,485 --> 03:02:15,842
MATT: So, 36 damage to Scanlan and to Kima, and to
you, Vex. 36 points of lightning damage. That ends

2702
03:02:15,842 --> 03:02:24,994
her turn. Tiberius, you're up. So you, it's your
turn now, as you're now

2703
03:02:24,994 --> 03:02:26,364
on top of the scorpion still.

2704
03:02:26,364 --> 03:02:27,280
ASHLEY: It's okay.

2705
03:02:27,280 --> 03:02:31,962
MARISHA: You're on top of me. I'm holding you!

2706
03:02:31,962 --> 03:02:35,612
ASHLEY: I got you.

2707
03:02:35,612 --> 03:02:40,915
ORION: Cool. This is-- there's still on the altar
that's raised above-- and all that.

2708
03:02:40,915 --> 03:02:44,306
TALIESIN: You've got a problem down there, to be
fair.

2709
03:02:44,306 --> 03:02:46,447
ORION: Where we're at?

2710
03:02:46,447 --> 03:02:48,942
TALIESIN: You've got the witch problem to deal
with.

2711
03:02:48,942 --> 03:02:50,938
MATT: What do you got, Tiberius? Quick, before you
miss your turn.

2712
03:02:50,938 --> 03:02:55,888
ORION: I shall miss nothing. I'm going to stay
right where I'm at.

2713
03:02:55,888 --> 03:02:56,860
MATT: All right.

2714
03:02:56,860 --> 03:03:13,077
ORION: I'm going to snicker, and I will (laughs)
hand out, put out my hand, and give my little ring

2715
03:03:13,077 --> 03:03:14,649
a rub, and let out a Fireball from it, right where
no one else but these buttholes will get hurt.

2716
03:03:14,649 --> 03:03:18,605
MATT: All right, so (laughs), I'd say probably a
20-foot radius around would put it about there.

2717
03:03:18,605 --> 03:03:20,943
LIAM: (Tiberius voice) What is the Common word for
it?

2718
03:03:21,140 --> 03:03:22,784
ALL: (Tiberius voice) Butthole.

2719
03:03:22,784 --> 03:03:26,731
MATT: So, as you polish off the ring and release
it, the bead of red energy streaks across,

2720
03:03:26,731 --> 03:03:32,286
blasting the floor, the secondary explosion, giant
Fireball just bursts into the room, go ahead and

2721
03:03:32,286 --> 03:03:34,101
roll damage on that.

2722
03:03:34,101 --> 03:03:53,081
ORION: Six, I have enough, there's a four, this is
terrible, help me count, eight.

2723
03:03:53,081 --> 03:03:59,043
MARISHA: Okay, well, we have all these twos. Let's
put the twos side by side. That's fun. Uh-huh.

2724
03:03:59,043 --> 03:04:01,500
LAURA: Your turns are taking so long!

2725
03:04:01,500 --> 03:04:03,386
ORION: 18. 23!

2726
03:04:03,386 --> 03:04:13,114
MATT: 23. Okay. The rest of these duergar
detonate, blasted away out of play. Just, their

2727
03:04:13,114 --> 03:04:16,358
bodies go thrown against the walls and the various
pillars in the room. There's two pillars over

2728
03:04:16,358 --> 03:04:21,957
there, they're kind of holding the ceiling up. The
rest of them just go thrown about the room. The

2729
03:04:21,957 --> 03:04:26,255
queen takes a bit of the damage, but seems to
shrug off most of it.

2730
03:04:26,255 --> 03:04:33,391
ORION: I'm going to spend two sorcerer points. And
I'm going to reach out my hand, and I'm going to

2731
03:04:33,391 --> 03:04:40,448
form an ice knife and-- where is the queen,
actually?

2732
03:04:40,448 --> 03:04:41,767
MATT: Right there.

2733
03:04:41,767 --> 03:04:48,810
ORION: Oh, very good. I'm going to throw the ice
knife right there.

2734
03:04:48,810 --> 03:04:53,665
MATT: Okay. Right there? All right.

2735
03:04:53,665 --> 03:04:56,264
ORION: And I cast it at level two.

2736
03:04:56,264 --> 03:05:00,919
MATT: All right. So you get to throw at a target,
though, right? Or are you just throwing

2737
03:05:00,919 --> 03:05:04,603
on the ground to do the radial? Okay, so you
take-- you form the ice knife, you throw it, it

2738
03:05:04,603 --> 03:05:08,804
streaks across, slams into the stone floor and
explodes, sending shards of ice out. Go ahead and

2739
03:05:08,804 --> 03:05:09,873
roll damage.

2740
03:05:09,873 --> 03:05:12,059
ORION: Which is 3d6, because it's at level two
now.

2741
03:05:12,059 --> 03:05:15,307
MATT: Correct. Saving throw, which it succeeds.

2742
03:05:15,307 --> 03:05:20,191
ORION: Much better. 14 points of damage.

2743
03:05:20,191 --> 03:05:26,766
MATT: Okay. Both succeed for half damage. So seven
points of damage to each. All right, got it, cool.

2744
03:05:26,766 --> 03:05:29,251
That ends your turn, Tiberius. Clarota, now--

2745
03:05:29,251 --> 03:05:32,626
ORION: How do you like them apples?!

2746
03:05:32,626 --> 03:05:40,361
MATT: Clarota steps forward-- Seeing the other
mind flayer there, steps past and decides to go

2747
03:05:40,361 --> 03:05:42,806
into a contest of wills against it.

2748
03:05:42,806 --> 03:05:46,331
MARISHA: Contest of wills, staring contest,
staring contest!

2749
03:05:46,331 --> 03:05:54,347
MATT: All right, this is intense. All right.
Clarota is going to step forward and begin to

2750
03:05:54,535 --> 03:05:59,495
intensely stare at-- you can see the air itself
seems to shimmer and push, like a strange bubble

2751
03:05:59,495 --> 03:06:03,815
shifting between the two of them at this
connection point. Mind flayer, now one-eyed and

2752
03:06:03,815 --> 03:06:10,246
seeping liquid from the side of its face, glares
back at him. Fails his saving throw.

2753
03:06:10,246 --> 03:06:11,893
MARISHA: That's right, he does.

2754
03:06:11,893 --> 03:06:18,254
MATT: This mind flayer suddenly diverts its
attention away from Clarota and towards the queen.

2755
03:06:18,254 --> 03:06:21,603
(cheering)

2756
03:06:21,603 --> 03:06:23,955
SAM: The old Dominate.

2757
03:06:23,955 --> 03:06:26,000
ASHLEY: Tight, tight, tight.

2758
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:27,443
(laughter)

2759
03:06:27,443 --> 03:06:34,081
MATT: That ends Clarota's turn. All right. The
duergar would go if they weren't all blasted to

2760
03:06:34,081 --> 03:06:38,088
hell. That brings us to Keyleth.

2761
03:06:38,088 --> 03:06:46,601
MARISHA: All right. I'm going to go right for the
king. You're coming for a ride, Tiberius. I'm

2762
03:06:46,601 --> 03:06:49,768
gonna make a straight line. I have a 40-foot
movement, pretty straight movement.

2763
03:06:49,768 --> 03:06:51,650
ORION: All right! Let's get 'em!

2764
03:06:51,650 --> 03:06:53,712
LAURA: Oh no, Tiberius fell off.

2765
03:06:53,712 --> 03:06:57,211
MATT: There you go.

2766
03:06:57,211 --> 03:07:01,880
MARISHA: Okay, I'm in melee, yeah?

2767
03:07:01,880 --> 03:07:02,877
MATT: Yes, you are.

2768
03:07:02,877 --> 03:07:05,272
MARISHA: All right, I'm gonna do my full three
multi-attack.

2769
03:07:05,272 --> 03:07:08,022
ORION: I'm maniacally laughing.

2770
03:07:08,022 --> 03:07:13,111
MATT: You are going to have a disadvantage on the
tail attack, because you have Tiberius on your

2771
03:07:13,111 --> 03:07:15,488
back and you're trying to make sure you don't hit
him with your tail.

2772
03:07:15,488 --> 03:07:16,348
MARISHA: Okay.

2773
03:07:16,348 --> 03:07:17,995
MATT: So, first two claw strikes.

2774
03:07:17,995 --> 03:07:21,943
MARISHA: Okay, first one, probably not gonna hit.
12?

2775
03:07:21,943 --> 03:07:24,677
MATT: No, that does not hit.

2776
03:07:24,677 --> 03:07:27,324
MARISHA: Second one. 16?

2777
03:07:27,324 --> 03:07:33,188
MATT: Does not hit. Clink, clink! Off the armor.
Tail strike.

2778
03:07:33,188 --> 03:07:37,029
MARISHA: Tail strike. Two. Ten. Nothing.

2779
03:07:37,029 --> 03:07:41,118
MATT: Yeah, unfortunately just his thick suit of
armor-- you're just hitting at him with the giant

2780
03:07:41,118 --> 03:07:43,620
scorpion claws, but nothing seems to be getting
through.

2781
03:07:43,620 --> 03:07:47,097
MARISHA: God, you're so heavy, Tiberius, god!

2782
03:07:47,097 --> 03:07:49,937
MATT: You hear this clacking scorpion angrily
(scorpion sounds).

2783
03:07:49,937 --> 03:07:52,687
MARISHA: My balance is wonky.

2784
03:07:52,687 --> 03:07:53,930
MATT: Pike, you're up!

2785
03:07:53,930 --> 03:08:00,034
ASHLEY: All right, time for some healing. So pull
me in there. I'm gonna do a-- I'm gonna do a Mass

2786
03:08:00,034 --> 03:08:11,539
Cure Wounds. At level five gives, which I thinks
gives-- thinks? Which methinks gives me 4d8? Plus

2787
03:08:11,539 --> 03:08:14,796
my spell ability modifier. Okay, so--

2788
03:08:14,796 --> 03:08:17,739
MARISHA: Get your heal on.

2789
03:08:17,739 --> 03:08:20,459
LIAM: (Yoda voice) 4d8 you would give.

2790
03:08:20,459 --> 03:08:30,023
ASHLEY: Oh, so, 20. 20 points of healing for
whoever would like it.

2791
03:08:30,023 --> 03:08:34,782
MATT: For everyone who's in the radius. Everyone
but Grog, essentially, gets healed for 20 points.

2792
03:08:34,782 --> 03:08:37,936
Grog's too far away from you, unfortunately.

2793
03:08:37,936 --> 03:08:40,723
SAM: Thank you, my love.

2794
03:08:40,723 --> 03:08:43,321
MATT: All right, Percy, you're up.

2795
03:08:43,321 --> 03:08:51,548
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to just get-- just
step into the doorway to take a look. I'm just

2796
03:08:51,548 --> 03:08:58,081
stepping one step. And now I'm just going to
shoot-- can I-- I'm just gonna try and-- The

2797
03:08:58,081 --> 03:09:03,316
minute I recognize what a basilisk is, since I've
faced them before, I'm going to do my best not to

2798
03:09:03,316 --> 03:09:04,852
look and take a shot.

2799
03:09:04,852 --> 03:09:09,251
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and fire with a
disadvantage against the basilisk on the far end

2800
03:09:09,251 --> 03:09:10,498
of the room.

2801
03:09:10,498 --> 03:09:11,893
SAM: Don't you shoot me.

2802
03:09:11,893 --> 03:09:13,992
MARISHA: Oh, that was a pretty one.

2803
03:09:13,992 --> 03:09:17,211
TALIESIN: I get 16 at my disadvantage.

2804
03:09:17,211 --> 03:09:19,779
MATT: 16 at disadvantage? That does hit. Go ahead
and roll damage.

2805
03:09:19,779 --> 03:09:22,292
TALIESIN: Nice! I'll be taking another shot, too.

2806
03:09:22,292 --> 03:09:25,137
MATT: Also, Tiberius, make another constitution
saving throw.

2807
03:09:25,137 --> 03:09:26,716
TALIESIN: Six points of damage.

2808
03:09:26,716 --> 03:09:30,353
MATT: Six points of damage to the basilisk, got
it.

2809
03:09:30,353 --> 03:09:36,719
TALIESIN: I'm going to take another shot, though.
16 again.

2810
03:09:36,719 --> 03:09:39,833
ORION: Ten.

2811
03:09:39,833 --> 03:09:45,756
TALIESIN: 16 hits. This time I do 12 points of
damage.

2812
03:09:45,756 --> 03:09:48,819
MARISHA: 12 points?

2813
03:09:48,819 --> 03:09:56,180
TALIESIN: 12 points. And then I'm gonna duck back
around the corner again.

2814
03:09:56,180 --> 03:10:01,018
MATT: Okay. Cool. As you duck around the corner,
you've gotten these strikes in, and as you're

2815
03:10:01,018 --> 03:10:09,257
trying to-- as you finish your blows on the
duergar king, Murghol, in front of you, you hear

2816
03:10:09,257 --> 03:10:15,493
this clanking sound as Tiberius's now fully stone
form falls off of the scorpion onto the ground,

2817
03:10:15,493 --> 03:10:16,969
beside you.

2818
03:10:16,969 --> 03:10:18,955
SAM: Oh no! He's stoned!

2819
03:10:18,955 --> 03:10:22,906
ASHLEY: You turned to stone?

2820
03:10:22,906 --> 03:10:24,553
LAURA: 'Cause of the basilisk.

2821
03:10:24,553 --> 03:10:25,931
LIAM: We've dealt with this before.

2822
03:10:25,931 --> 03:10:27,940
LAURA: Basilisk blood, we can fix it.

2823
03:10:27,940 --> 03:10:31,046
SAM: I think you pee on the body and it cures
them.

2824
03:10:31,046 --> 03:10:33,597
ASHLEY: Can I-- I can't, I have to go--

2825
03:10:33,597 --> 03:10:37,755
SAM: Let's try it and find out.

2826
03:10:37,755 --> 03:10:41,862
MATT: The basilisk now takes its turn.

2827
03:10:41,862 --> 03:10:44,423
LIAM: (stone Tiberius voice) Please, no!

2828
03:10:44,423 --> 03:10:51,874
MATT: Steps forward onto the edge. It's going to
go ahead and-- it's gonna be for Lady Kima. It's

2829
03:10:51,874 --> 03:10:55,074
going to attempt to make its stare at her. Lady
Kima--

2830
03:10:55,074 --> 03:10:56,591
ASHLEY: Close your eyes!

2831
03:10:56,591 --> 03:10:59,160
LAURA: She's smart, she's closing her eyes.

2832
03:10:59,160 --> 03:11:03,524
MATT: Lady Kima, who's currently in this blood
frenzy against the king, unfortunately is not

2833
03:11:03,524 --> 03:11:06,530
paying attention. Off to the side, the basilisk
gets a glance out, which she looks at from the

2834
03:11:06,530 --> 03:11:10,585
corner of her eye, she sees the movement over and
has a hard time pushing through the stiffness as

2835
03:11:10,585 --> 03:11:13,622
the gaze begins to take a clenching effect on her
body.

2836
03:11:13,622 --> 03:11:14,720
LAURA: Oh no.

2837
03:11:14,720 --> 03:11:22,043
COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: All set, let's go.

2838
03:11:22,043 --> 03:11:29,195
MATT: Yes, thank you. Let's do that. Oh, Waze.
Why's my phone on? All right, so, that brings us

2839
03:11:29,195 --> 03:11:33,530
to the-- Oof, okay.

2840
03:11:33,530 --> 03:11:36,657
LIAM: (computer voice) I'm sorry, I can't help you
with that, Vex'ahlia.

2841
03:11:36,657 --> 03:11:45,002
MATT: This mind flayer, who's currently Dominated,
steps forward and is going to attempt to make a

2842
03:11:45,002 --> 03:11:51,982
tentacle grab against the queen. Queen Ulara
manages to dodge out of the way, seeing this

2843
03:11:51,982 --> 03:11:56,571
coming, and just backhands it, while taking a step
back. Unfortunately does not cling with the

2844
03:11:56,571 --> 03:12:05,596
tentacle. That ends its action. Yeah,
unfortunately that didn't hit. All right, next, at

2845
03:12:05,596 --> 03:12:07,290
the top, that brings us to Vax.

2846
03:12:07,290 --> 03:12:13,374
LIAM: I'm hasted. I'm gonna try to go stealth
again from where I am. So I'm stealth, 17-- 30.

2847
03:12:13,575 --> 03:12:19,750
Okay. I'm going to scuttle along the floor and
leap on the back of the basilisk and try to stab

2848
03:12:19,750 --> 03:12:22,466
it in the eye while looking at the ceiling.

2849
03:12:22,466 --> 03:12:27,348
MATT: Well, at the start of your turn, it's within
30 feet of you and you can see it.

2850
03:12:27,348 --> 03:12:29,153
Are you going to--

2851
03:12:29,153 --> 03:12:30,784
LIAM: Not look at it, no, no.

2852
03:12:30,784 --> 03:12:37,312
MATT: Okay, so you're taking disadvantage on this
attack. So you move behind, you're hidden.

2853
03:12:37,312 --> 03:12:40,743
LIAM: 15 for my first attack.

2854
03:12:40,743 --> 03:12:44,423
MATT: Your first attack, that will not hit,
unfortunately.

2855
03:12:44,423 --> 03:12:49,995
LIAM: And second time, 19 for the second attack.

2856
03:12:49,995 --> 03:12:51,337
MATT: That does hit, yes.

2857
03:12:51,337 --> 03:12:59,116
LIAM: Okay. Feel for the eyes, stab it with keen
dagger-- Four. 11.

2858
03:12:59,116 --> 03:13:07,718
MATT: Okay. As you rush over, you take your first
strike at the basilisk, you see it reel back and

2859
03:13:07,718 --> 03:13:11,261
slap around its tail. You barely just get out of
the way, and as you see its head turning around to

2860
03:13:11,261 --> 03:13:15,786
attempt to glare at you, you instinctively take
your offhand dagger and place it directly into the

2861
03:13:15,786 --> 03:13:20,389
eye socket of the basilisk. It sinks past your
fingers and you feel that warm rush of blood and

2862
03:13:20,389 --> 03:13:24,622
gore against your hand. As you pull back, it just
slumps to the ground.

2863
03:13:24,622 --> 03:13:27,138
(cheering)

2864
03:13:27,138 --> 03:13:35,596
ASHLEY: We'll get you some of that-- we'll get you
some of that blood. Blood! Basilisk blood!

2865
03:13:35,596 --> 03:13:44,300
LIAM: I only moved ten feet. So who's stone right
now? Tiberius and-- wasn't-- aren't two people?

2866
03:13:44,300 --> 03:13:48,401
MATT: Lady Kima is mid-effect and Tiberius is
solid stone.

2867
03:13:48,401 --> 03:13:55,310
LIAM: I've got Haste on-- If I've got Haste on,
can I get to Kima? 'Cause I've got haste boots.

2868
03:13:55,310 --> 03:13:57,610
MATT: I would say, yeah, you could spend the rest
of your movement doing that, yeah.

2869
03:13:57,610 --> 03:14:02,591
LIAM: Okay, and I use my thumb to slide some of
its blood off the blade

2870
03:14:02,591 --> 03:14:04,270
and drip it onto her eyes.

2871
03:14:04,270 --> 03:14:11,410
MATT: Okay. All right. That ends your turn. That
brings us to Grog. Grog turns and is going to go

2872
03:14:11,410 --> 03:14:24,800
ahead and go raging, frenzied, against the queen.
And a critical hit.

2873
03:14:24,800 --> 03:14:26,644
(cheering)

2874
03:14:26,644 --> 03:14:29,272
MARISHA: He crit?

2875
03:14:29,272 --> 03:14:30,548
ORION: Yeah.

2876
03:14:30,548 --> 03:14:34,730
MATT: The first hit, she's gonna go ahead and use
her reaction to do Shield, it's going to up her

2877
03:14:34,730 --> 03:14:40,021
defense. First attack misses, so two attacks miss
now and the last attack is a critical hit, which

2878
03:14:40,021 --> 03:14:42,020
is nice. So that's a--

2879
03:14:42,020 --> 03:14:45,386
MARISHA: No crits for you! Crit happens, whether
you're here or not.

2880
03:14:45,386 --> 03:14:52,469
MATT: All right, so that's 31 points of damage.
Oof, that's a hefty chunk. All right, that ends

2881
03:14:52,469 --> 03:14:54,945
Grog's turn. That brings us to Scanlan!

2882
03:14:54,945 --> 03:14:59,211
SAM: I'm next to the king, right? I'm near the
king? Over there.

2883
03:14:59,211 --> 03:15:00,840
MATT: Yep. You're right next to him.

2884
03:15:00,840 --> 03:15:08,805
SAM: Okay. I just make eye contact with him and I
mentally tell him that he really has the urge to

2885
03:15:08,945 --> 03:15:16,915
try to do a headstand. Lay down his weapon and he
really just wants to see if he can do it.

2886
03:15:16,915 --> 03:15:18,612
(laughter)

2887
03:15:18,612 --> 03:15:20,387
MATT: Okay.

2888
03:15:20,387 --> 03:15:21,570
SAM: Suggestion.

2889
03:15:21,570 --> 03:15:24,381
MATT: Okay. (laughs) What's your DC?

2890
03:15:24,381 --> 03:15:25,451
SAM: 19.

2891
03:15:25,451 --> 03:15:27,016
MATT: All right. This is through the hand cone?

2892
03:15:27,016 --> 03:15:29,097
SAM: Through the hand cone, through the hand
cone.

2893
03:15:29,097 --> 03:15:37,494
MATT: Okay. That will be a 20, unfortunately.
Makes his saving throw. He glances back towards

2894
03:15:37,494 --> 03:15:42,258
you with a look of confusion for a second. Looks
at his feet and like begins to reach forward and

2895
03:15:42,258 --> 03:15:46,827
then steels his mind and looks up at you angrily.
All right.

2896
03:15:46,827 --> 03:15:51,568
SAM: Can I also, as my bonus action-- Who's around
me? Who needs inspiration? Who needs inspiring?

2897
03:15:51,568 --> 03:15:59,121
Who's-- yeah, oh, shit. I'll give Pike some
inspiration, 'cause she's my awesome sweetheart.

2898
03:15:59,121 --> 03:16:00,377
ASHLEY: What do I get?

2899
03:16:00,377 --> 03:16:01,492
LAURA: You get 1d8.

2900
03:16:01,492 --> 03:16:02,980
ASHLEY: Hey, thanks, man.

2901
03:16:02,980 --> 03:16:07,213
MATT: Next up is King Murghol, who's furious now.
Both of his beasts have been slain and most of his

2902
03:16:07,213 --> 03:16:14,648
men have been completely torn asunder by
multitudes of arrows and fireball spells. He, now

2903
03:16:14,648 --> 03:16:20,313
growing in physical form, on top of already the
musculature he acquired from that potion, is going

2904
03:16:20,313 --> 03:16:27,251
to make his three attacks against whatever is
nearby. That's actually going to be-- actually,

2905
03:16:27,251 --> 03:16:30,290
that's gonna be two strikes against you, Scanlan,
since you just now tried to make him stand on his

2906
03:16:30,290 --> 03:16:32,260
head, and one against Kima.

2907
03:16:32,260 --> 03:16:33,699
(laughter)

2908
03:16:33,699 --> 03:16:35,602
MATT: That is a 15--

2909
03:16:35,602 --> 03:16:37,190
SAM: Hit.

2910
03:16:37,190 --> 03:16:38,719
MATT: -- a 24--

2911
03:16:38,719 --> 03:16:40,485
SAM: (higher voice) Hit.

2912
03:16:40,485 --> 03:16:42,728
MATT: -- and against Kima is a 20, that also hits.
So all three hit.

2913
03:16:42,728 --> 03:16:44,591
LIAM: Nobody puts baby in the corner.

2914
03:16:44,591 --> 03:16:46,057
(laughter)

2915
03:16:46,057 --> 03:16:58,210
MATT: Oof, all right. So the first strike hits you
for 21 points of slashing damage.

2916
03:16:58,210 --> 03:16:59,616
SAM: Still alive.

2917
03:16:59,616 --> 03:17:02,553
MATT: The next one hits you for 23 points of
slashing damage.

2918
03:17:02,553 --> 03:17:04,559
SAM: No longer alive (laughs).

2919
03:17:04,559 --> 03:17:06,230
ASHLEY: You're no longer alive?

2920
03:17:06,230 --> 03:17:07,994
LAURA: Are you unconscious?!

2921
03:17:07,994 --> 03:17:12,072
MATT: Scanlan falls unconscious on the ground from
the two strikes of the king. The third strike back

2922
03:17:12,072 --> 03:17:16,848
towards Kima, who's currently seizing from the
effect of the spell. She's restrained, so he has

2923
03:17:16,848 --> 03:17:17,786
advantage.

2924
03:17:17,786 --> 03:17:20,011
LIAM: But she's got the basilisk blood in her
eyes.

2925
03:17:20,011 --> 03:17:31,470
MATT: There's a process to undoing a creature into
stone. To your knowledge, it does not seem to be

2926
03:17:31,470 --> 03:17:41,156
having an effect. However, Lady Kima takes 22
points of damage. All righty. That brings us to--

2927
03:17:41,156 --> 03:17:44,470
Vex, you're up.

2928
03:17:44,470 --> 03:17:47,662
LAURA: Oh, that's me. Every time!

2929
03:17:47,662 --> 03:17:49,062
LIAM: I'm Vex.

2930
03:17:49,062 --> 03:18:01,803
LAURA: No, you're not. Okay, I'm gonna hail, I'm
gonna-- hail of arr-- no, yeah, Hail of Thorns? At

2931
03:18:01,803 --> 03:18:04,247
level three.

2932
03:18:04,247 --> 03:18:05,715
MATT: Okay, at who?

2933
03:18:05,715 --> 03:18:17,488
LAURA: At the queen and the illithid. So, I
should've transferred my bonus action over to--

2934
03:18:17,488 --> 03:18:23,802
but I didn't, that's okay. That gives me-- I
should've done this before,

2935
03:18:23,802 --> 03:18:25,402
I'm an asshole, I'm sorry.

2936
03:18:25,402 --> 03:18:27,305
LIAM: But what about in the game?

2937
03:18:27,305 --> 03:18:34,106
LAURA: That gives me 2d10.

2938
03:18:34,106 --> 03:18:36,283
MATT: Additional damage to the arrow.

2939
03:18:36,283 --> 03:18:37,726
LAURA: Yes.

2940
03:18:37,726 --> 03:18:42,395
MATT: So it explodes around, right? All right, so,
fire the arrow. So, as your bonus action, you go

2941
03:18:42,395 --> 03:18:45,337
and you grab one of the arrows out from the back,
and as you pull it back you can see a bunch of

2942
03:18:45,337 --> 03:18:50,471
these little thorns begin to grow and sprout from
the actual shaft of the arrow. You release it and

2943
03:18:50,471 --> 03:18:51,907
as it arcs across--

2944
03:18:51,907 --> 03:18:53,324
LAURA: Yes! Natural 20!

2945
03:18:53,324 --> 03:18:55,216
(cheering)

2946
03:18:55,216 --> 03:19:02,007
MATT: Against the queen. All right, go ahead and
roll the damage for the arrow and the damage for

2947
03:19:02,007 --> 03:19:04,363
the spell. And all that doubles.

2948
03:19:04,363 --> 03:19:05,942
LAURA: Oh, awesome.

2949
03:19:05,942 --> 03:19:10,043
MARISHA: (sings) All that doubles is gold.

2950
03:19:10,043 --> 03:19:13,499
TALIESIN: (sings) Only shooting arrows.

2951
03:19:13,499 --> 03:19:17,271
ORION: (sings) In a butthole.

2952
03:19:17,271 --> 03:19:19,811
LAURA: Yeah, all of it doubles.

2953
03:19:19,811 --> 03:19:22,593
MATT: The bonus at the end doesn't double, just
the dice.

2954
03:19:22,593 --> 03:19:24,373
LAURA: Oh, so, 36--

2955
03:19:24,373 --> 03:19:32,681
MATT: 36 points of damage. Yeah, plus the seven.
And then it does-- it explodes? In a radius. And

2956
03:19:32,681 --> 03:19:35,386
it does the dice damage, the 2d10, to--

2957
03:19:35,386 --> 03:19:38,734
LAURA: To everything within five feet.

2958
03:19:38,734 --> 03:19:40,743
MATT: All right, so the mind flayer and Grog.

2959
03:19:40,743 --> 03:19:45,324
LAURA: Oh, right, yeah, I should've hit the mind
flayer with that arrow. No, it would've still hit

2960
03:19:45,324 --> 03:19:46,687
Grog. Okay.

2961
03:19:46,687 --> 03:19:48,726
LIAM: Grog is a tank.

2962
03:19:48,726 --> 03:19:50,800
LAURA: They have to make a dexterity saving
throw.

2963
03:19:50,800 --> 03:19:54,869
MATT: All righty. Grog does not make it and the
mind flayer does not make it.

2964
03:19:54,869 --> 03:19:56,230
LAURA: Yes!

2965
03:19:56,230 --> 03:20:00,064
MATT: All right, cool. All right, second arrow you
can fire now if you want to.

2966
03:20:00,064 --> 03:20:04,718
LAURA: Second arrow. I'm gonna fire from my
flaming bow. I've got one shot on that left. At

2967
03:20:04,718 --> 03:20:06,282
her again.

2968
03:20:06,282 --> 03:20:07,789
MATT: All right.

2969
03:20:07,789 --> 03:20:09,555
LAURA: And that's a 28.

2970
03:20:09,555 --> 03:20:10,661
MATT: That hits.

2971
03:20:10,661 --> 03:20:22,518
LAURA: And that's nine plus a ten, where's my ten?
There they are. That's plus two. 11.

2972
03:20:22,518 --> 03:20:28,684
MATT: All right. You see flames begin to burn up
along the side of her robe and she's looking

2973
03:20:28,684 --> 03:20:36,836
really flustered and frustrated at this point. All
right, that brings us to Kima's turn. No. She's

2974
03:20:36,836 --> 03:20:42,480
made of hardy stuff. Kima currently is fighting
this, is going to go ahead and release an entire--

2975
03:20:42,480 --> 03:20:45,668
all of her attacks against the king Murghol as
he's right in front of her. She has disadvantage

2976
03:20:45,668 --> 03:20:49,370
on that, unfortunately, because she is restrained.
She's gonna make two attacks against him using

2977
03:20:49,370 --> 03:20:56,432
Divine Smite, expending a 3rd-level spell. So
that's 3d8 extra damage to each strike. So the

2978
03:20:56,432 --> 03:21:03,146
first one hits. Both hit. All right. She's going
to do it twice.

2979
03:21:03,146 --> 03:21:05,930
That's gonna be 6d8 additional damage.

2980
03:21:05,930 --> 03:21:08,424
MARISHA: Ooh! That's hot.

2981
03:21:08,424 --> 03:21:22,047
MATT: Oof. Okay. So, as Kima rears back, her first
strike comes down and hits overhead, into King

2982
03:21:22,047 --> 03:21:26,229
Murghol's armor, and as it does, it hits. The
blade only goes about a few inches in, but then

2983
03:21:26,229 --> 03:21:30,191
all of a sudden the blade heats up white-hot and
actually buries itself an additional six inches

2984
03:21:30,191 --> 03:21:34,746
into his shoulder. He screams out in pain, reaches
up and grabs the blade and as he does, his hand

2985
03:21:34,746 --> 03:21:40,663
actually burns in the process. She pulls the blade
out, around and swings it down again, sinking

2986
03:21:40,663 --> 03:21:44,260
another eight inches into the side of his torso.
This time with a giant arc of white divine light

2987
03:21:44,260 --> 03:21:48,992
into the side. He looks like he's starting to
bleed out from the two of the wounds really

2988
03:21:48,992 --> 03:21:54,061
heavily. The king is looking a little rough. That
ends Kima's turn. Kima's going to try and make a

2989
03:21:54,061 --> 03:22:03,329
saving throw. Kima pulls the blade out, and turns
to stone herself.

2990
03:22:03,329 --> 03:22:08,754
LAURA: Oh shit. Shit, shit, shit. He's still at
like really high health, too. The king.

2991
03:22:08,754 --> 03:22:10,387
SAM: What, he is?

2992
03:22:10,387 --> 03:22:11,990
MATT: The king is looking a little rough.

2993
03:22:11,990 --> 03:22:19,240
SAM: You never know. He might just start doing a
headstand.

2994
03:22:19,240 --> 03:22:21,503
(laughter)

2995
03:22:21,503 --> 03:22:23,287
MATT: The queen's turn.

2996
03:22:23,287 --> 03:22:24,471
LAURA: Oh no.

2997
03:22:24,471 --> 03:22:33,792
MATT: The queen looks over at Grog in front of
her, kinda frustratedly, uses a bulk of sorcery

2998
03:22:33,792 --> 03:22:40,518
points, puts her hand up towards him as he's
pulling his axe back angrily. He fails his save.

2999
03:22:40,518 --> 03:22:44,683
And he puts his axe back down and looks towards
the rest of the group.

3000
03:22:44,683 --> 03:22:46,954
MARISHA: Oh no! Not again!

3001
03:22:46,954 --> 03:22:49,214
MATT: Eye color glazed over.

3002
03:22:49,214 --> 03:22:51,891
SAM: He's so easily influenced.

3003
03:22:51,891 --> 03:22:53,714
LAURA: No, he's under her control.

3004
03:22:53,714 --> 03:23:01,689
MATT: So that was her sorcery points, her quick
action. She then says, "We're not gonna die this

3005
03:23:01,689 --> 03:23:10,685
"day alone and I won't die. My love, I'm sorry, but
there's much more work to be done." And she raises

3006
03:23:10,685 --> 03:23:14,579
her hand up and you see this buildup of green
arcane energy at her hand. She turns it towards

3007
03:23:14,579 --> 03:23:20,373
the rest of the group, faces it up towards the
ceiling and releases this pulse of arcane, green,

3008
03:23:20,373 --> 03:23:25,291
ill-looking energy that blasts into the stone
ceiling. As it does, the stone itself

3009
03:23:25,291 --> 03:23:31,571
disintegrates in a large chunk, and a glowing
mass of seeping, hot, molten magma begins to pour

3010
03:23:31,571 --> 03:23:33,937
into the room.

3011
03:23:33,937 --> 03:23:35,430
MARISHA: Oh shit!

3012
03:23:35,430 --> 03:23:38,447
ORION: Where's it coming from?

3013
03:23:38,447 --> 03:23:40,737
MATT: It's now coming from right here.

3014
03:23:40,737 --> 03:23:42,058
LAURA: Oh my god.

3015
03:23:42,058 --> 03:23:44,859
LIAM: (sings) TPK. TPK.

3016
03:23:44,859 --> 03:23:50,404
MATT: So now, magma is pouring onto the throne
room from above. The giant fall that is on top of

3017
03:23:50,404 --> 03:23:52,389
the fortress is now peering into the room.

3018
03:23:52,389 --> 03:23:54,311
SAM: (high-pitched) Someone grab me and leave.

3019
03:23:54,311 --> 03:24:03,833
MATT: That brings us to Tiberius, who is stone.
Clarota currently looks around and--

3020
03:24:03,833 --> 03:24:07,132
ORION: Hold on. Am I conscious in stone form?

3021
03:24:07,132 --> 03:24:11,224
MATT: No. You are a slate. You are a blue screen.
You are Grog after the intellect devourer.

3022
03:24:11,224 --> 03:24:14,565
ASHLEY: Oh god, this is bad.

3023
03:24:14,565 --> 03:24:16,076
MATT: Okay. (laughs)

3024
03:24:16,076 --> 03:24:17,946
SAM: Pike, it's all on you, dude.

3025
03:24:17,946 --> 03:24:20,597
MARISHA: Do you have water?

3026
03:24:20,597 --> 03:24:23,835
ASHLEY: I can create it.

3027
03:24:23,835 --> 03:24:33,027
MATT: Clarota steps back and grabs Lady Kima and
begins dragging her back through the doorway.

3028
03:24:33,027 --> 03:24:35,276
LAURA: Oh god, we've got to get out. That's a
retreat.

3029
03:24:35,276 --> 03:24:42,326
MATT: Pulling her down towards the stairway. That
brings us to Keyleth.

3030
03:24:42,326 --> 03:24:47,672
SAM: Keyleth. Keyleth. Get us out of here.

3031
03:24:47,672 --> 03:24:56,125
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. I come out of the form.
Yes, thank you.

3032
03:24:56,125 --> 03:24:58,224
MATT: It's a free action.

3033
03:24:58,224 --> 03:25:01,620
ORION: Isn't there a dead basilisk right in front
of us right now?

3034
03:25:01,620 --> 03:25:04,410
MATT: There is a body of a dead basilisk on the
ground, yes.

3035
03:25:04,410 --> 03:25:13,100
MARISHA: I'm going to take Wind Wall. I'm gonna
cast Wind Wall and try and wrap it around the lava

3036
03:25:13,100 --> 03:25:17,885
column and try and contain it within the Wind
Wall, cooling it down. Essentially making a

3037
03:25:17,885 --> 03:25:20,098
tornado-like vortex around the lava.

3038
03:25:20,098 --> 03:25:24,925
MATT: Okay. For the purposes of this, I want you
to go ahead and make a basic religion check.

3039
03:25:24,925 --> 03:25:27,387
MARISHA: Okay.

3040
03:25:27,387 --> 03:25:30,717
MATT: Wait no, not religion. For you it'd be
nature. Just for the purposes of my thought, I

3041
03:25:30,717 --> 03:25:33,735
think a nature check would be an interesting way
to see how this plays out.

3042
03:25:33,735 --> 03:25:34,982
MARISHA: 18.

3043
03:25:34,982 --> 03:25:42,210
MATT: 18? Okay. So, as you bring this gust of cold
wind, swirling around, the column of magma begins

3044
03:25:42,210 --> 03:25:46,611
to cool and darken as Trinket is like backing up
against the wall and the magma is starting to

3045
03:25:46,611 --> 03:25:55,388
singe the edge of Trinket's nails. It cools to a
dark, black, kind of rockish color. And the magma

3046
03:25:55,388 --> 03:26:04,181
fall ceases, but you can see parts of it breaking
and beginning to break past that shell exterior.

3047
03:26:04,181 --> 03:26:05,410
So you've slowed it.

3048
03:26:05,410 --> 03:26:11,069
MARISHA: This isn't gonna hold for long! Somebody
rub some blood on Tiberius, quick, and let's get

3049
03:26:11,069 --> 03:26:13,962
the hell out of here! I'm just holding this.

3050
03:26:13,962 --> 03:26:19,095
MATT: Holding it there? Okay. That brings us to
Pike.

3051
03:26:19,095 --> 03:26:23,968
ASHLEY: There's so much to do. I don't know if I
should heal you, if I should rub blood on you or

3052
03:26:23,968 --> 03:26:26,285
if I should go try to remove the curse from Grog.

3053
03:26:26,285 --> 03:26:29,426
LAURA: See if you can get the curse out of Grog.
Because if we've got to retreat, then--

3054
03:26:29,426 --> 03:26:32,780
ASHLEY: Can Remove Curse remove the thing off of
him?

3055
03:26:32,780 --> 03:26:35,692
MATT: From your knowledge, no, it's an arcane
effect, not a curse.

3056
03:26:35,692 --> 03:26:41,065
ASHLEY: That's an arcane effect. Okay, so, Grog
might be on his own for a little bit. Okay. So can

3057
03:26:41,065 --> 03:26:47,284
I heal Scanlan and then also rub some basilisk
blood on Tiberius?

3058
03:26:47,284 --> 03:26:52,367
MATT: From your previous experience, it's not the
blood directly. The blood itself has to be

3059
03:26:52,367 --> 03:26:58,208
distilled into a specific alchemical form to
reverse the effect.

3060
03:26:58,208 --> 03:27:02,416
ORION: We just drank the blood last time.

3061
03:27:02,416 --> 03:27:06,641
MATT: No, it wasn't drinking. After the battle,
you guys took the blood, prepared it, and then

3062
03:27:06,641 --> 03:27:08,606
used it as part of the recovery.

3063
03:27:08,606 --> 03:27:12,415
MARISHA: Will someone collect some blood?

3064
03:27:12,415 --> 03:27:16,969
MATT: Okay, so you heal Scanlan. How much does he
heal?

3065
03:27:16,969 --> 03:27:21,634
ORION: The king's almost dead.

3066
03:27:21,634 --> 03:27:26,041
MARISHA: Do we want to kill the king? Do we need
somebody alive to help us?

3067
03:27:26,041 --> 03:27:27,547
ASHLEY: Oh, 19, 19!

3068
03:27:27,547 --> 03:27:32,243
MATT: So you're healed 19. You're on the ground,
prone, but you're conscious now.

3069
03:27:32,243 --> 03:27:33,478
SAM: Hi!

3070
03:27:33,478 --> 03:27:37,432
MATT: You look up at Pike and smile and you look
over and see this large column of magma that's now

3071
03:27:37,432 --> 03:27:40,522
cracking through stone and pouring into the throne
room again.

3072
03:27:40,522 --> 03:27:43,653
ASHLEY: Is there anything else we can do? Is there
anything else I can do at this moment?

3073
03:27:43,653 --> 03:27:48,931
MATT: No, this has been a heal, this has been--
no, okay, you can move, that's about it.

3074
03:27:48,931 --> 03:27:52,351
ASHLEY: I can move? Can I take anyone with me
while I move?

3075
03:27:52,351 --> 03:27:54,818
MATT: I will say you can drag him. You'll be at
half speed.

3076
03:27:54,818 --> 03:27:57,488
ASHLEY: Can I try to drag Tiberius away from the
magma?

3077
03:27:57,488 --> 03:27:59,794
MATT: You can try. Make a strength check.

3078
03:27:59,794 --> 03:28:03,233
SAM: You're two feet tall. He's a dragon.

3079
03:28:03,233 --> 03:28:04,918
MATT: Let's say athletics, do athletics.

3080
03:28:04,918 --> 03:28:09,351
ASHLEY: Athletics? 19.

3081
03:28:09,351 --> 03:28:16,686
MATT: Okay. So, you grab onto Tiberius, you rush
over after healing him, grab and start dragging

3082
03:28:16,686 --> 03:28:20,814
him towards the entrance. At half-speed you manage
to get him three squares, that's as far as you

3083
03:28:20,814 --> 03:28:26,325
got. As you're pulling back, the king, as a
reaction, gets one strike on you with his sword.

3084
03:28:26,325 --> 03:28:30,263
That's gonna be a 19.

3085
03:28:30,263 --> 03:28:31,956
ASHLEY: Get outta here.

3086
03:28:31,956 --> 03:28:33,069
(laughter)

3087
03:28:33,069 --> 03:28:34,370
MATT: Your AC is 20?

3088
03:28:34,370 --> 03:28:35,302
ASHLEY: It's 20.

3089
03:28:35,302 --> 03:28:36,586
MATT: So the blade hits you--

3090
03:28:36,586 --> 03:28:37,821
ASHLEY: I just flip him off.

3091
03:28:37,821 --> 03:28:38,918
(laughter)

3092
03:28:38,918 --> 03:28:41,916
MATT: The blade comes down towards you, but with a
flash of divine energy in your shoulder armor, it

3093
03:28:41,916 --> 03:28:45,792
just gets deflected off the side and you glare at
him out of the side of your face. And continue to

3094
03:28:45,792 --> 03:28:47,600
drag Tiberius out of the room.

3095
03:28:47,600 --> 03:28:49,351
LIAM: Now go home and get your shine box.

3096
03:28:49,351 --> 03:28:50,506
(laughter)

3097
03:28:50,506 --> 03:28:51,755
MATT: All right. Percy, you're up.

3098
03:28:51,755 --> 03:28:55,992
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to step into the
room, to give some cover. Right about, probably

3099
03:28:55,992 --> 03:28:58,927
just slightly on the other end of this.

3100
03:28:58,927 --> 03:29:01,024
MATT: Where, over here?

3101
03:29:01,024 --> 03:29:04,008
TALIESIN: No, like, next to Keyleth, like near
Keyleth.

3102
03:29:04,008 --> 03:29:08,468
MATT: Oh, you're gonna have to go around here,
then. This is a really harrowing place.

3103
03:29:08,468 --> 03:29:16,947
TALIESIN: Okay, the first thing I'm going to do,
is I'm going to-- I've got my ice shot loaded. I'm

3104
03:29:16,947 --> 03:29:20,759
going to take a shot at the break in the ceiling
and I'm gonna try and ice it over.

3105
03:29:20,759 --> 03:29:24,949
MATT: Okay, all right. So as you pull over, you go
ahead and aim up with your ice shot ready. Go

3106
03:29:24,949 --> 03:29:26,386
ahead and fire.

3107
03:29:26,386 --> 03:29:27,897
TALIESIN: That's 20.

3108
03:29:27,897 --> 03:29:31,672
MATT: 20 definitively hits. It's not hard to do.
Go ahead and roll damage and that will signify how

3109
03:29:31,672 --> 03:29:36,355
long and how much it will stop. So just the ice
damage. Not the actual bullet, it won't do

3110
03:29:36,355 --> 03:29:37,720
anything. So just--

3111
03:29:37,720 --> 03:29:38,968
TALIESIN: Oh. So just the ice damage

3112
03:29:38,968 --> 03:29:40,200
MATT: Just the ice damage.

3113
03:29:40,200 --> 03:29:40,980
TALIESIN: Two.

3114
03:29:40,980 --> 03:29:43,874
MATT: Two. Okay. So as you blast up, you can see,
as the magma's beginning to pour down again, you

3115
03:29:43,874 --> 03:29:48,215
blast it and it immediately-- a spot cools into a
rock and begins to slip again. You've maybe given

3116
03:29:48,215 --> 03:29:52,755
yourself a couple more seconds. That may be what
you need, you don't know. But that's all you got

3117
03:29:52,755 --> 03:29:53,725
on that one.

3118
03:29:53,725 --> 03:29:55,801
TALIESIN: Okay, my next shot, I'm just gonna turn
to the king and just shoot.

3119
03:29:55,801 --> 03:29:57,134
MATT: Okay, go for it.

3120
03:29:57,244 --> 03:30:02,084
TALIESIN: I'm also gonna spend a point for
additional damage. And I'm also taking

3121
03:30:02,245 --> 03:30:04,847
Sharpshooter for additional damage.

3122
03:30:04,847 --> 03:30:06,031
MATT: Okay.

3123
03:30:06,031 --> 03:30:09,409
TALIESIN: That's 16.

3124
03:30:09,409 --> 03:30:11,953
MATT: 16 versus armor class will not hit,
unfortunately.

3125
03:30:11,953 --> 03:30:16,466
TALIESIN: Oh! Wait, okay, no, I just, I don't get
the-- oh god, it's not Pathfinder, gah!

3126
03:30:16,466 --> 03:30:18,147
MATT: Yeah.

3127
03:30:18,147 --> 03:30:21,326
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine. I'm gonna spend my
bonus action to take another shot.

3128
03:30:21,326 --> 03:30:23,548
MATT: Okay, so you're using your Action Surge?

3129
03:30:23,548 --> 03:30:24,403
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3130
03:30:24,403 --> 03:30:27,328
MATT: Okay. So Action Surge. You now have two more
attacks. Go for it.

3131
03:30:27,328 --> 03:30:29,992
TALIESIN: 23, eff you.

3132
03:30:29,992 --> 03:30:31,236
MATT: That hits.

3133
03:30:31,236 --> 03:30:32,724
(laughter)

3134
03:30:32,724 --> 03:30:35,909
TALIESIN: That's nine points of damage.

3135
03:30:35,909 --> 03:30:38,144
MATT: Nine points of damage, got it.

3136
03:30:38,144 --> 03:30:39,948
TALIESIN: Taking another shot.

3137
03:30:39,948 --> 03:30:41,014
MATT: All right.

3138
03:30:41,014 --> 03:30:47,407
TALIESIN: This shot's fire, fire bonus damage. And
I'm also gonna spend another grit point to maybe

3139
03:30:47,407 --> 03:30:51,896
do a little more damage. 28 to hit.

3140
03:30:51,896 --> 03:30:55,711
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage. With
the extra grit point you do two dice, right?

3141
03:30:55,711 --> 03:31:05,767
TALIESIN: Yeah. I get a bonus die, I just have to
find one. Oh, that'll do. That's 17 points of

3142
03:31:05,767 --> 03:31:07,424
damage plus one point of fire damage.

3143
03:31:07,424 --> 03:31:15,498
MATT: Nice. Okay, so, the next-- the first shot
fires, just ricochets off his armor and streaks

3144
03:31:15,498 --> 03:31:18,992
across the room. You get his attention, though,
and he looks back at you with this kind of wild

3145
03:31:18,992 --> 03:31:22,691
look in his eyes, the muscles tensing. You can see
the armor actually bending and twisting against

3146
03:31:22,691 --> 03:31:28,235
his physical form underneath. However, the next
shot blasts off side of his jaw, there's actually

3147
03:31:28,235 --> 03:31:31,658
a giant gap now in his flesh as he looks back at
you and you can see his teeth. And as he grits

3148
03:31:31,658 --> 03:31:36,395
down towards you, now definitely intent on getting
vengeance on that, the second shot (impact sound)

3149
03:31:36,395 --> 03:31:40,629
takes off a chunk of his head. You can see the
skull exposed on where you've now taken a piece of

3150
03:31:40,629 --> 03:31:44,410
flesh off the top of his scalp. He's looking
pretty rough.

3151
03:31:44,410 --> 03:31:49,430
TALIESIN: Let's move it, people. And I'm gonna
take like a step back towards the door. Just with

3152
03:31:49,430 --> 03:31:52,146
what's remaining of my movement.

3153
03:31:52,146 --> 03:31:57,801
MATT: Okay. You can get back to there. All right.
That brings us to--

3154
03:31:57,801 --> 03:32:02,569
TALIESIN: Oh, I killed him, didn't I? No, he's not
dead, damn it.

3155
03:32:02,569 --> 03:32:04,876
MATT: He's not dead yet. Not dead yet.

3156
03:32:04,876 --> 03:32:06,749
TALIESIN: I know, that would've been so cool.

3157
03:32:06,749 --> 03:32:15,500
MATT: All right. The mind flayer, who is no longer
dominated as Clarota took his attention off of

3158
03:32:15,500 --> 03:32:21,566
that for the time being, looks around at everyone,
sees the circumstance, the magma flowing down, and

3159
03:32:21,566 --> 03:32:25,559
just grabs his chest and you can see his form
blink out and vanish.

3160
03:32:25,559 --> 03:32:28,122
ORION: (groans) He peaced out.

3161
03:32:28,122 --> 03:32:35,196
MATT: That brings us to the top. Vax. At this
round, by the way, is broken and has begun to

3162
03:32:35,196 --> 03:32:39,719
spread, the magma has now filled this much of the
room. And it's quickening.

3163
03:32:39,719 --> 03:32:48,782
LIAM: My boots of haste are on, so I run-- I just
dart right around Grog, around that column, up to

3164
03:32:48,782 --> 03:32:55,478
the queen, while pulling out my keen dagger, I
speak my mother's name, kiss the blade and shove

3165
03:32:55,478 --> 03:32:58,836
it in, right into her collarbone.

3166
03:32:58,836 --> 03:33:00,585
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for the attack.

3167
03:33:00,585 --> 03:33:05,092
LIAM: So that's a two, but I'm gonna use Luck. I
get ad-- 20.

3168
03:33:05,092 --> 03:33:06,170
MATT: 20 does hit.

3169
03:33:06,170 --> 03:33:09,459
LIAM: Because of it, and because Grog's there,
this--

3170
03:33:09,459 --> 03:33:11,578
MATT: Grog is not an ally, currently. You do not
get Sneak Attack.

3171
03:33:11,578 --> 03:33:17,007
LIAM: Don't get Sneak Attack, all right. Three,
ten, then. That's the first attack. And the second

3172
03:33:17,007 --> 03:33:20,736
one also hits, that's a 29.

3173
03:33:20,736 --> 03:33:22,165
MATT: All right.

3174
03:33:22,165 --> 03:33:23,564
LIAM: Is ten.

3175
03:33:23,564 --> 03:33:30,033
MATT: Ten, nice. So the first blade plunges into
her clavicle, she maneuvers out of the way to the

3176
03:33:30,033 --> 03:33:34,075
point where it misses any vital points, but still
sinks in. She looks at you angrily and you can see

3177
03:33:34,075 --> 03:33:40,372
her dull white, ashy, duergar eyes flash with an
intense arcane rage. As you pull the blade out,

3178
03:33:40,372 --> 03:33:46,050
her eyes dart around with some sort of a plan, a
thought process going through her head, as the

3179
03:33:46,050 --> 03:33:50,254
other blade sinks into the side of her torso she
spits out blood that actually spatters across your

3180
03:33:50,254 --> 03:33:56,480
face. She pushes the blade out and you see her
preparing herself for something. That ends your

3181
03:33:56,480 --> 03:34:02,261
turn. Grog currently moves forward towards you.

3182
03:34:02,261 --> 03:34:06,373
LIAM: (Grog voice) Wrong direction!

3183
03:34:06,373 --> 03:34:10,153
MATT: That is a 25 versus armor class.

3184
03:34:10,153 --> 03:34:12,122
LIAM: Yeah, but Uncanny Dodge!

3185
03:34:12,122 --> 03:34:19,538
MATT: How many times can you-- you've already used
that. It's once per encounter. Once per encounter

3186
03:34:19,538 --> 03:34:23,542
you can use that. Next one is a 21 versus armor
class?

3187
03:34:23,542 --> 03:34:25,534
LIAM: Once a round.

3188
03:34:25,534 --> 03:34:29,982
MATT: Once a round you can do it? Okay, well never
mind. So take half on that first attack. All

3189
03:34:29,982 --> 03:34:37,747
right, so. First strike comes at you with a-- oof,
that'll be 19 points of damage. Reduced to nine.

3190
03:34:37,747 --> 03:34:39,027
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

3191
03:34:39,027 --> 03:34:46,306
MATT: Second strike hits you for a total of 15
points of damage. So 24 total.

3192
03:34:46,306 --> 03:34:49,323
MARISHA: Could be worse.

3193
03:34:49,323 --> 03:34:53,696
MATT: And that's Grog's go. That brings us to
Scanlan.

3194
03:34:53,696 --> 03:34:55,202
LIAM: That really hurts, Grog.

3195
03:34:55,202 --> 03:35:01,929
SAM: With my knowledge of the arcane arts, do I
have any knowledge that using my Dispel Magic

3196
03:35:01,929 --> 03:35:05,745
spell would work on Grog? Or do I just have to try
it?

3197
03:35:05,745 --> 03:35:11,949
MATT: It's a possibility. You know the spell
that's been cast on him-- you use it. There is a

3198
03:35:11,949 --> 03:35:14,470
chance, but it has to be a contested roll.

3199
03:35:14,470 --> 03:35:15,598
LIAM: You could roll a 20.

3200
03:35:15,598 --> 03:35:17,355
MARISHA: You could roll a 20.

3201
03:35:17,355 --> 03:35:20,706
SAM: Does it take my move to just stand up?

3202
03:35:20,706 --> 03:35:24,809
MATT: Yes, it does, unfortunately. So it's your
call.

3203
03:35:24,809 --> 03:35:28,286
SAM: But I don't have to be standing to cast a
spell--

3204
03:35:28,286 --> 03:35:33,366
MATT: No, but I would say it's going to be
difficult, it's going to give--

3205
03:35:33,366 --> 03:35:34,864
SAM: All right, I'll stand up.

3206
03:35:34,864 --> 03:35:41,948
MATT: All right. You get back up. What are you
doing?

3207
03:35:41,948 --> 03:35:48,406
SAM: And I will-- Jesus, is it better for me to
get out of there or get the king?

3208
03:35:48,406 --> 03:35:50,708
LAURA: Yeah, get the king. You may be able to kill
him. He's on his last legs, probably.

3209
03:35:50,708 --> 03:35:52,083
MATT: He's looking pretty rough.

3210
03:35:52,083 --> 03:35:54,002
SAM: Yeah, but Keyleth is right behind him.

3211
03:35:54,002 --> 03:35:55,612
LIAM: Do it. Stab him.

3212
03:35:55,612 --> 03:35:57,019
LAURA: You can attack him with your sword.

3213
03:35:57,019 --> 03:36:00,188
SAM: I am a tiny, tiny boy. I can only do--

3214
03:36:00,188 --> 03:36:04,130
LAURA: Do it anyway. He's at his last legs. It
would be epic, Scanlan.

3215
03:36:04,130 --> 03:36:07,269
MATT: What do you got? Go ahead, quick. Magma's
pouring through.

3216
03:36:07,269 --> 03:36:16,186
SAM: Okay, I swing my Singing Dawnblade at him.
(laughs) I have a dawn blade. It's just so lame

3217
03:36:16,186 --> 03:36:17,631
though! It's so weak!

3218
03:36:17,631 --> 03:36:21,078
MATT: Okay, so. Go ahead and roll for an attack,
d20.

3219
03:36:21,078 --> 03:36:23,247
SAM: A natural 20.

3220
03:36:23,247 --> 03:36:25,775
(cheering)

3221
03:36:25,775 --> 03:36:31,003
MARISHA: We said he could roll a 20! We called it!
Who called it? We called it.

3222
03:36:31,003 --> 03:36:32,716
MATT: So, roll the dice.

3223
03:36:32,716 --> 03:36:35,909
SAM: So that's eight.

3224
03:36:35,909 --> 03:36:40,941
MATT: You rolled an eight. Times two, that's 16,
plus whatever the bonus damage is for the sword.

3225
03:36:40,941 --> 03:36:47,666
SAM: Plus seven. Plus the dawn blade gets another
bonus attack at disadvantage.

3226
03:36:47,666 --> 03:36:53,072
MATT: It does. So, you strike with a critical hit,
doing-- let's see, that's eight, 16, plus seven,

3227
03:36:53,072 --> 03:36:55,800
23 points of damage, go ahead and roll for a
second attack.

3228
03:36:55,800 --> 03:36:59,062
SAM: I've never hit anyone with a sword before!
Five.

3229
03:36:59,062 --> 03:37:01,537
ASHLEY: Can I give him a War God's Blessing and
give him a plus ten?

3230
03:37:01,537 --> 03:37:02,852
MATT: You can.

3231
03:37:02,852 --> 03:37:04,400
ASHLEY: All right, plus ten, so fifteen.

3232
03:37:04,400 --> 03:37:06,715
MATT: So what's your total? You rolled a five,
plus--

3233
03:37:06,715 --> 03:37:10,103
SAM: Five plus-- ten-- I don't know, what am I
adding? I've never used a sword before!

3234
03:37:10,103 --> 03:37:14,122
MATT: Add your proficiency modifier, which is
four, plus your strength modifier, so that's five

3235
03:37:14,122 --> 03:37:17,760
to that, which is ten, makes it 20, which hits!
Roll damage on the attack.

3236
03:37:17,760 --> 03:37:19,128
(cheering)

3237
03:37:19,128 --> 03:37:20,806
MARISHA: Kill him, kill him!

3238
03:37:20,806 --> 03:37:21,907
SAM: Six!

3239
03:37:21,907 --> 03:37:26,292
MATT: Six points of damage. All right, six on that
plus your strength, which is one. Seven. Plus the

3240
03:37:26,292 --> 03:37:32,391
dawn blade, which is-- that's eight. So that's
eight damage on top of the 23.

3241
03:37:32,391 --> 03:37:33,759
How do you want to do this?

3242
03:37:33,759 --> 03:37:35,326
(cheering)

3243
03:37:35,326 --> 03:37:40,924
SAM: I-- as I draw back the blade, I say, oh! You
should've stood on your head! And I lop it off.

3244
03:37:40,924 --> 03:37:50,083
MATT: So. As you say that, you-- the blade
vibrates to the sound of your voice, like the

3245
03:37:50,083 --> 03:37:55,772
echoing of a song of Scanlan behind yours in
almost a chorus out of nowhere. The blade streaks

3246
03:37:55,772 --> 03:38:01,462
through the air, coming down, slitting across the
back of his Achilles' tendon. He instinctually

3247
03:38:01,462 --> 03:38:04,419
falls to one knee, which is kind of the height
level for you. As you do, you bring the blade

3248
03:38:04,419 --> 03:38:10,385
around with a flourish and take Murghol's head off
his shoulders. It spins, tumbles to the ground,

3249
03:38:10,385 --> 03:38:18,140
and rolls across the floor into the magma.
Blackened beard curling back as the rest of his

3250
03:38:18,140 --> 03:38:23,391
face is melted away by the lava, which is now
pouring pretty heavily into this room.

3251
03:38:23,391 --> 03:38:25,838
SAM: (sings) Scanlan make you feel good!

3252
03:38:25,838 --> 03:38:30,796
MATT: All right. So that's your action. And your
movement. And your bonus action. No, you did your

3253
03:38:30,796 --> 03:38:32,044
bonus action to do the extra attack.

3254
03:38:32,044 --> 03:38:33,905
SAM: Oh! Great, great. I don't know how to use
swords!

3255
03:38:33,905 --> 03:38:41,894
MATT: All right, so. That's the end of your turn.
Wow! You used a sword! And got a kill! On a boss!

3256
03:38:41,894 --> 03:38:42,980
SAM: Yay!

3257
03:38:42,980 --> 03:38:44,615
ASHLEY: Good job, Scanlan!

3258
03:38:44,615 --> 03:38:49,859
MATT: All right, King Murghol's turn would be now,
but he's on the ground. Vex?

3259
03:38:49,859 --> 03:38:57,435
LAURA: I call Trinket back. Get him away from that
lava. I run past, 'cause I can't-- can I see? Do I

3260
03:38:57,435 --> 03:39:00,012
have an angle or is it being blocked by molten
tornado?

3261
03:39:00,012 --> 03:39:02,106
MATT: You-- it's completely blocked right now.

3262
03:39:02,106 --> 03:39:04,006
LAURA: Can I run across behind it?

3263
03:39:04,006 --> 03:39:05,593
MATT: Through here?

3264
03:39:05,593 --> 03:39:08,491
LAURA: Yeah. Is that magmous right now?

3265
03:39:08,491 --> 03:39:12,772
MATT: Yeah, it is. It's still pouring! She slowed
it down, but it's still breaking through and

3266
03:39:12,772 --> 03:39:16,407
pouring out slower. It would be even bigger if
they hadn't slowed it.

3267
03:39:16,407 --> 03:39:19,580
LAURA: Okay, then well, maybe I won't run in that
direction. I run in the other direction and down--

3268
03:39:19,580 --> 03:39:21,840
yeah. So I can see.

3269
03:39:21,840 --> 03:39:23,255
MATT: Go for it. Roll for an attack.

3270
03:39:23,255 --> 03:39:24,365
LAURA: Okay.

3271
03:39:24,365 --> 03:39:25,510
MATT: First attack.

3272
03:39:25,510 --> 03:39:31,559
LAURA: First attack is (sings) 20. No. 19.

3273
03:39:31,559 --> 03:39:32,500
MATT: Hits.

3274
03:39:32,500 --> 03:39:36,931
LAURA: Yes! Okay. 14.

3275
03:39:36,931 --> 03:39:38,794
MATT: 14 points of damage.

3276
03:39:38,794 --> 03:39:47,440
LAURA: Second attack is-- Second attack is (sings)
21!

3277
03:39:47,440 --> 03:39:49,307
MATT: Hits. Roll damage on that.

3278
03:39:49,307 --> 03:39:52,292
LAURA: What's that? 12?

3279
03:39:52,292 --> 03:39:53,919
MATT: 12 to hit?

3280
03:39:53,919 --> 03:39:54,692
LAURA: Yeah.

3281
03:39:54,692 --> 03:39:55,814
MATT: Or 12 damage?

3282
03:39:55,814 --> 03:39:56,793
LAURA: 12 damage.

3283
03:39:56,793 --> 03:39:58,012
MATT: All right, 12 damage.

3284
03:39:58,012 --> 03:40:00,843
LAURA: Oh, um. Hunter's Mark. Damn it.

3285
03:40:00,843 --> 03:40:02,295
Bonus action!

3286
03:40:02,295 --> 03:40:05,057
MATT: Yep. All right, so both arrows (impact
sounds). One clips her in the leg, and the other

3287
03:40:05,057 --> 03:40:10,209
embeds itself in her abdomen. You see she grabs
for it. She's looking really rough. Next is Kima.

3288
03:40:10,209 --> 03:40:16,784
Kima's stone. It's now the queen's turn. She looks
over at you who's stabbed her, the arrows in her

3289
03:40:16,784 --> 03:40:22,280
abdomen, and she looks up at Grog and says,
(sighs) "We've got business elsewhere." And she

3290
03:40:22,280 --> 03:40:25,738
reaches out and touches Grog. Both of them blink
out, Dimension Door.

3291
03:40:25,738 --> 03:40:27,321
SAM: We've lost Grog again!

3292
03:40:27,321 --> 03:40:32,413
MATT: A very familiar purplish color as you've
seen you cast it, they Dimension Door out of the

3293
03:40:32,413 --> 03:40:34,020
entire vicinity.

3294
03:40:34,020 --> 03:40:36,134
SAM: Son of a--

3295
03:40:36,134 --> 03:40:39,443
MARISHA: This is the second time we've lost Grog.

3296
03:40:39,443 --> 03:40:43,712
MATT: At which point, the stone rocks crack on the
column and the magma now goes into full pour.

3297
03:40:43,712 --> 03:40:45,425
LAURA: We've got to get out!

3298
03:40:45,425 --> 03:40:47,936
MATT: You guys have to get out of that tunnel.
What do you do now, what's the process?

3299
03:40:47,936 --> 03:40:49,038
ASHLEY: We run!

3300
03:40:49,038 --> 03:40:51,041
SAM: Wait, we gotta get our stone friends out.

3301
03:40:51,041 --> 03:40:54,518
MATT: So, this is going into a skill challenge
now.

3302
03:40:54,518 --> 03:40:58,486
LAURA: Yeah, we all run out that--

3303
03:40:58,486 --> 03:41:02,939
SAM: No, we don't all run out, they're stone, we
have to drag them out, yeah.

3304
03:41:02,939 --> 03:41:06,448
LIAM: Who all's stone, it's Tiberius
and Kima? Okay.

3305
03:41:06,719 --> 03:41:09,655
MARISHA: Can we-- where's the magic carpet? Throw
their asses on the magic carpet!

3306
03:41:09,655 --> 03:41:17,059
LAURA: Grog has the magic carpet. Grog had
everything.

3307
03:41:17,179 --> 03:41:20,834
SAM: Wait, Feather Fall, do you have Feather
Fall?

3308
03:41:20,834 --> 03:41:24,327
ASHLEY: Before, before we leave, can I take some
of the basilisk's blood and put it in a vial?

3309
03:41:24,327 --> 03:41:28,452
MATT: Okay, this will be the first skill
challenge. Go ahead and make a dexterity check.

3310
03:41:28,452 --> 03:41:29,512
ASHLEY: Dexterity check?

3311
03:41:29,512 --> 03:41:35,726
MARISHA: Oh, can we get the magic carpet now?

3312
03:41:35,726 --> 03:41:39,577
MATT: No, the magic carpet is in the bag of
holding. That thing is huge. You carry that with

3313
03:41:39,577 --> 03:41:41,795
you, you would be at disadvantage for everything
you've been doing.

3314
03:41:41,795 --> 03:41:43,183
ORION: Oh, I see.

3315
03:41:43,183 --> 03:41:44,398
ASHLEY: 18!

3316
03:41:44,398 --> 03:41:49,465
MATT: 18, okay, so. I mean, you go over to it, and
you manage to gather up into your wine skin a

3317
03:41:49,465 --> 03:41:55,014
little bit of basilisk's blood, best you can. The
magma pulls close to you and you manage to just

3318
03:41:55,014 --> 03:42:00,829
take six points of fire damage from just the
general heat of the magma now pouring into the

3319
03:42:00,829 --> 03:42:04,696
room. It's spilling out and now just continuing to
fill the rest of this chamber.

3320
03:42:04,696 --> 03:42:06,687
LIAM: I shout to Percy, come, Tiberius, now!

3321
03:42:06,687 --> 03:42:07,818
TALIESIN: We pick him up.

3322
03:42:07,818 --> 03:42:11,314
MATT: Both of you guys make an athletics check.

3323
03:42:11,314 --> 03:42:13,477
SAM: Oh, it's not a strength check?

3324
03:42:13,477 --> 03:42:15,699
MATT: For this, this is just an athletics to pull
them all off.

3325
03:42:15,699 --> 03:42:16,832
LIAM: 19.

3326
03:42:16,832 --> 03:42:18,547
TALIESIN: 17.

3327
03:42:18,547 --> 03:42:23,304
MATT: Okay. You guys grab and pull Tiberius out of
the room. It takes the two of you to heft him

3328
03:42:23,304 --> 03:42:28,898
over. You manage to pull him out of the way, that
works out well. Down the stairway, all right. We

3329
03:42:28,898 --> 03:42:31,891
don't need the video for this, we're just going to
do this visually. So, you guys manage to bring

3330
03:42:31,891 --> 03:42:34,599
Tiberius down the stairway. What are you doing,
Scanlan?

3331
03:42:34,599 --> 03:42:40,457
SAM: I'm unfurling my Bull's Strength scroll and
reading it so I get a plus five to strength? Is

3332
03:42:40,457 --> 03:42:41,473
that a thing?

3333
03:42:41,473 --> 03:42:44,874
MATT: All right, so that's Enhance Ability. So you
go ahead and give yourself Enhance Ability. Your

3334
03:42:44,874 --> 03:42:47,282
strength is now-- you have advantage on all of
your strength checks.

3335
03:42:47,282 --> 03:42:52,474
SAM: Okay, and I start to help, who was pushing
Kima? I'm gonna help push Kima out.

3336
03:42:52,474 --> 03:42:56,091
LAURA: Oh wait, no! Wait, didn't Clarota take
Kima?

3337
03:42:56,091 --> 03:42:57,668
MATT: No, Clarota pulled Kima out of the room.

3338
03:42:57,668 --> 03:42:59,444
LAURA: Oh, so we're all fucking fine, let's just
get out.

3339
03:42:59,444 --> 03:43:00,550
MATT: So you guys are fine.

3340
03:43:00,550 --> 03:43:04,801
MARISHA: I go ahead and on our way out I cast
Create Water, and I kinda just use my air ability

3341
03:43:04,801 --> 03:43:09,112
and make a mist to try and like mist the lava
that's coming towards us.

3342
03:43:09,112 --> 03:43:13,502
MATT: Okay. You do, but the magma's so intense and
this has filled so much of the room now that you

3343
03:43:13,502 --> 03:43:17,466
get a localized area. The rest of it just kinda
flows around and continues to fill the space. All

3344
03:43:17,466 --> 03:43:21,772
right, so. All of you guys make a dexterity check
to try to get down quickly. Go for it.

3345
03:43:21,772 --> 03:43:22,738
ASHLEY: Can I make another one?

3346
03:43:22,738 --> 03:43:24,114
MATT: Yes, everyone makes one.

3347
03:43:24,114 --> 03:43:25,468
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

3348
03:43:25,468 --> 03:43:27,236
LIAM: Natural 20.

3349
03:43:27,236 --> 03:43:30,396
ORION: (hoarsely) I rolled a 19!

3350
03:43:30,396 --> 03:43:31,749
MARISHA: 20.

3351
03:43:31,749 --> 03:43:33,431
SAM: (sings) Seven!

3352
03:43:33,431 --> 03:43:34,620
ASHLEY: Four!

3353
03:43:34,620 --> 03:43:37,185
LAURA: Do I get to roll twice 'cause of terrain?

3354
03:43:37,185 --> 03:43:39,287
MATT: Because of-- yes you do.

3355
03:43:39,287 --> 03:43:41,092
SAM: Do I get my Enhance Ability?

3356
03:43:41,092 --> 03:43:42,380
MATT: Not for this one.

3357
03:43:42,380 --> 03:43:45,188
ORION: I would like to note that I am frozen like
this.

3358
03:43:45,188 --> 03:43:46,572
MATT: Okay, Tiberius is.

3359
03:43:46,572 --> 03:43:47,656
LAURA: 29.

3360
03:43:47,656 --> 03:43:52,230
MATT: Okay, gotcha. So, Pike and Scanlan, both of
you guys are, unfortunately 'cause you're smaller

3361
03:43:52,230 --> 03:43:56,119
and your legs are moving, you guys rush down the
stairway and curl around. As the rest of you make

3362
03:43:56,119 --> 03:44:01,161
your way to the door, which is currently closed,
you are all kinda gathered at the exterior of

3363
03:44:01,161 --> 03:44:06,771
that hidden doorway. It's currently dark and held
shut on where you guys entered. However, you two,

3364
03:44:07,015 --> 03:44:10,877
the magma's now reached the stairway. It's
beginning to pour down off the top, and it manages

3365
03:44:10,877 --> 03:44:17,019
to catch the two of you. You guys each take five
points of heat damage from the magma's proximity.

3366
03:44:17,019 --> 03:44:18,594
LIAM: To the two ladies?

3367
03:44:18,594 --> 03:44:23,213
MATT: No, Pike and Scanlan. You guys make it to
the bottom floor. The doorway is currently closed

3368
03:44:23,213 --> 03:44:25,429
for the secret exit of the fortress.

3369
03:44:25,429 --> 03:44:32,800
LIAM: Vax drops Tiberius' stone ass to the ground
and starts feeling to get the mechanism of the

3370
03:44:32,800 --> 03:44:33,982
door open.

3371
03:44:33,982 --> 03:44:37,358
SAM: Are we at the foot of the stairs yet, me and
Pike?

3372
03:44:37,358 --> 03:44:39,114
MATT: You guys just make it to the foot of the
stairs. You guys are now--

3373
03:44:39,114 --> 03:44:40,435
MARISHA: It's a big stone door?

3374
03:44:40,435 --> 03:44:42,329
MATT: Yeah, it's the one you guys, the one you
guys-- it opens up, outward.

3375
03:44:42,329 --> 03:44:46,209
MARISHA: I just cast Stone Shape and make a hole.

3376
03:44:46,209 --> 03:44:50,595
MATT: Okay, as you're feeling around for the
mechanism, Keyleth steps forward and basically the

3377
03:44:50,595 --> 03:44:53,416
stone turns into almost a clay, and she just pulls
it apart.

3378
03:44:53,416 --> 03:44:57,385
MARISHA: Sorry, Vax. I didn't mean to, like,
overstep there.

3379
03:44:57,385 --> 03:45:00,692
MATT: A giant glob of magma pours down and
splashes down onto the ground, hitting everyone in

3380
03:45:00,692 --> 03:45:06,038
the vicinity. Everyone down here takes 12 points
of heat damage.

3381
03:45:06,038 --> 03:45:08,630
LIAM: Ah, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot!

3382
03:45:08,630 --> 03:45:10,268
LAURA: Hot hot hot hot hot.

3383
03:45:10,268 --> 03:45:14,098
LIAM: All right, I'm picking up Tiberius' stone
butt and continuing--

3384
03:45:14,098 --> 03:45:19,321
MATT: Okay, you guys push through the open hole
that Keyleth pushed in, sweat dripping down your

3385
03:45:19,321 --> 03:45:24,919
faces as the heat proximity to you is
nigh-intolerable. You make your way out of the

3386
03:45:24,919 --> 03:45:27,539
gate and now you have that giant magma flow.

3387
03:45:27,539 --> 03:45:29,859
LAURA: Oh, right! Is the thing not-- wasn't
there--

3388
03:45:29,859 --> 03:45:34,593
MATT: No no-- as you guys go and step out, the
doorway that opened up, previously? Is what parted

3389
03:45:34,593 --> 03:45:38,060
the magma flow. You pulled it open, so now it's
just a wall of magma in front of you.

3390
03:45:38,060 --> 03:45:39,939
LAURA: She also had created a wall barrier.

3391
03:45:39,939 --> 03:45:41,306
MARISHA: I did create a wall over top.

3392
03:45:41,306 --> 03:45:42,655
MATT: You did. It's not there anymore.

3393
03:45:42,655 --> 03:45:43,750
MARISHA: It was permanent!

3394
03:45:43,750 --> 03:45:47,806
MATT: It was permanent, but a perpetual flow of
magma on it for a period of a few hours will

3395
03:45:47,806 --> 03:45:49,407
eventually eat through a stone wall.

3396
03:45:49,407 --> 03:45:50,654
LAURA: Can you cast it again?

3397
03:45:50,654 --> 03:45:53,780
MARISHA: I can. Yeah. Do it again. Bam.

3398
03:45:53,780 --> 03:45:57,624
MATT: Okay. It's probably the last of that. You
create a stone wall that juts out, once again

3399
03:45:57,624 --> 03:46:03,985
blocking off the magma flow. You guys all step out
of the room just as the main force of magma begins

3400
03:46:03,985 --> 03:46:07,910
to fill the room behind you. Everyone make one
more dexterity check to get out in time, as it's a

3401
03:46:07,910 --> 03:46:09,660
small space and you're pushing out.

3402
03:46:09,660 --> 03:46:11,264
SAM: Natural 20.

3403
03:46:11,264 --> 03:46:13,602
ORION: 16.

3404
03:46:13,602 --> 03:46:14,917
MATT: You made nothing.

3405
03:46:14,917 --> 03:46:17,142
MARISHA: "You made nothing." Seven.

3406
03:46:17,142 --> 03:46:18,381
TALIESIN: Ten.

3407
03:46:18,381 --> 03:46:20,377
ASHLEY: Two.

3408
03:46:20,377 --> 03:46:21,544
LAURA: Oh no. 29.

3409
03:46:21,544 --> 03:46:22,691
LIAM: 12.

3410
03:46:22,691 --> 03:46:31,857
MATT: Okay. Everyone under 15: you, you, Percy, I
believe, and Keyleth. The magma now, as you're

3411
03:46:31,857 --> 03:46:36,236
helping getting your friends out, you're pushing
out, you push Vex out-- Vex darts out, Scanlan

3412
03:46:36,236 --> 03:46:42,292
manages to get out. As you guys are pulling
Tiberius through, the hefty force of magma comes

3413
03:46:42,292 --> 03:46:45,511
funneling down into the room and splashes across
the floor.

3414
03:46:45,511 --> 03:46:51,054
TALIESIN: Oh, that's a lot of dice.

3415
03:46:51,054 --> 03:46:55,755
MATT: That is 18 points of heat damage.

3416
03:46:55,755 --> 03:46:57,084
LIAM: Vax is unconscious.

3417
03:46:57,084 --> 03:46:58,760
MARISHA: 18 points?

3418
03:46:58,760 --> 03:47:03,289
MATT: As you're pushing through, Vax, you fall
unconscious as the magma is currently lapping at

3419
03:47:03,289 --> 03:47:07,514
the back of your leg. The rest of you begin
pushing out as you begin to realize that your

3420
03:47:07,514 --> 03:47:10,493
half-elf friend is currently melting in a pool of
magma.

3421
03:47:10,493 --> 03:47:12,389
ASHLEY: Can I grab him? Can I grab him out?

3422
03:47:12,389 --> 03:47:17,085
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength check. This is
strength at this point, this is pure adrenaline

3423
03:47:17,085 --> 03:47:18,771
pushing through.

3424
03:47:18,771 --> 03:47:21,464
ASHLEY: 12!

3425
03:47:21,464 --> 03:47:25,230
MATT: 12. You manage to start pulling him up
through the hole that Keyleth made.

3426
03:47:25,230 --> 03:47:30,043
TALIESIN: I'm going to assist, I'm pulling out--
I'm doing another ice shot to try and cool off the

3427
03:47:30,043 --> 03:47:30,940
magma around him.

3428
03:47:30,940 --> 03:47:32,356
LAURA: I send Trinket up, to like, pull him.

3429
03:47:32,356 --> 03:47:34,678
MATT: Before you get to that point, as you're
readying for it, 'cause it's a small space-- as

3430
03:47:34,678 --> 03:47:42,992
you're pulling it, giant bear claws come over and
latch onto the back of Vax's armor. The grizzly

3431
03:47:42,992 --> 03:47:49,605
bear begins to tense, pulling back. Makes a
strength check. That'll do it. Both of you manage

3432
03:47:49,605 --> 03:47:55,604
to pull you out. You take an additional bit of
heat damage. You are now at two failed saving

3433
03:47:55,604 --> 03:47:57,943
throws. Two failed death saving throws.

3434
03:47:57,943 --> 03:47:59,865
LIAM: I am a centimeter away from real death.

3435
03:47:59,865 --> 03:48:04,665
MATT: As he pulls it out, you can see most of his
foot is melted. And his right leg.

3436
03:48:04,665 --> 03:48:06,372
SAM: Aw, that's his best leg.

3437
03:48:06,372 --> 03:48:09,348
TALIESIN: I pull a level two healing potion, just
get it in his mouth.

3438
03:48:09,348 --> 03:48:12,086
MATT: Okay, you pull it out. At this point, the
magma's beginning to fill up the room,

3439
03:48:12,086 --> 03:48:13,088
by the way.

3440
03:48:13,088 --> 03:48:16,550
MARISHA: Okay, wait wait wait, can I take my stone
wall and like, close it off?

3441
03:48:16,550 --> 03:48:17,704
We're all out, right?

3442
03:48:17,704 --> 03:48:19,418
MATT: You're outside of it. How long does Stone
Shape last?

3443
03:48:19,418 --> 03:48:21,128
MARISHA: Stone Shape?

3444
03:48:21,128 --> 03:48:22,304
MATT: What you used on the wall.

3445
03:48:22,304 --> 03:48:24,696
MARISHA: I'm just-- I'm just taking it away.

3446
03:48:24,696 --> 03:48:25,788
MATT: Closing the wall?

3447
03:48:25,788 --> 03:48:27,519
MARISHA: I'm closing it. I can do it again, I
still have two more spell slots.

3448
03:48:27,519 --> 03:48:29,092
MATT: Okay, how many spells do you have at that
level?

3449
03:48:29,092 --> 03:48:30,598
MARISHA: Three.

3450
03:48:30,598 --> 03:48:31,926
MATT: Three. So you spent--

3451
03:48:31,926 --> 03:48:33,308
MARISHA: One, so far.

3452
03:48:33,308 --> 03:48:36,004
MATT: One going out, coming-- no, wait, it's the
same-- you haven't had a chance to do a full

3453
03:48:36,004 --> 03:48:37,258
night's rest.

3454
03:48:37,258 --> 03:48:41,309
MARISHA: I know. I was an animal all week-- all
last game. I didn't use any last game.

3455
03:48:41,309 --> 03:48:43,278
MATT: That's true, so you used the stone form,
used Stone Wall.

3456
03:48:43,278 --> 03:48:46,509
MARISHA: I used one Stone Wall last week and I
have two level five spells now.

3457
03:48:46,509 --> 03:48:49,854
MATT: That's true, that's true, you do, that's
good. All right, I just wanted to make sure. Okay,

3458
03:48:49,854 --> 03:48:52,977
so as you do that, you send up another Stone Wall.
It blocks off the magma just as it begins to pour

3459
03:48:52,977 --> 03:48:58,162
over and spill out into this vicinity. It'll last
a short time, but it'll last enough for what you

3460
03:48:58,162 --> 03:48:59,614
guys need. You guys drag--

3461
03:48:59,614 --> 03:49:00,634
ASHLEY: Can I heal him?

3462
03:49:00,634 --> 03:49:03,802
MATT: You can attempt to, yeah, go for it.

3463
03:49:03,802 --> 03:49:09,691
LAURA: Anticipation.

3464
03:49:09,691 --> 03:49:12,185
MARISHA: I know. C'mon, Pike!

3465
03:49:12,185 --> 03:49:13,440
ASHLEY: 24.

3466
03:49:13,440 --> 03:49:15,503
MATT: All right. Heals you.

3467
03:49:15,503 --> 03:49:17,289
LAURA: Oh my god.

3468
03:49:17,289 --> 03:49:20,247
MATT: Comes to consciousness. You guys are about
ten feet away from the base of the stronghold.

3469
03:49:20,247 --> 03:49:26,121
Your foot heals up, but it's still burned.

3470
03:49:26,121 --> 03:49:27,745
LAURA: Ew, get that away from me.

3471
03:49:27,745 --> 03:49:35,205
MATT: For the time being, until you can take some
serious physical rest, your movement is reduced by

3472
03:49:35,205 --> 03:49:40,569
five. And your stealth rolls are currently at
disadvantage.

3473
03:49:40,569 --> 03:49:43,201
ASHLEY: Can that ever be healed?

3474
03:49:43,201 --> 03:49:48,696
MATT: Over time with some rest it can be, but
right now-- like, you're healed up, but that foot

3475
03:49:48,696 --> 03:49:54,935
is scarred. It probably spent a good six seconds
completely submerged in molten lava.

3476
03:49:54,935 --> 03:49:57,763
LIAM: Are you telling me I'll never compete in the
roller derby again?

3477
03:49:57,763 --> 03:49:58,836
(laughter)

3478
03:49:58,836 --> 03:50:04,249
MATT: Quite possibly. You all are just on the
outskirts of the stronghold. You can see now

3479
03:50:04,249 --> 03:50:11,423
elements of the windows of the top floor are
beginning to glow with internal light, as the

3480
03:50:11,423 --> 03:50:15,448
entire stronghold is currently filling up entirely
with molten rock.

3481
03:50:15,448 --> 03:50:17,927
SAM: Oh, I left my keys in there!

3482
03:50:17,927 --> 03:50:19,301
(laughter)

3483
03:50:19,301 --> 03:50:24,737
MATT: You're all resting for a moment, off to the
side. Grog is missing. And you all take a

3484
03:50:24,737 --> 03:50:28,854
moment to realize that somehow you all managed to
survive this, mostly.

3485
03:50:28,854 --> 03:50:30,076
MARISHA: Sort of.

3486
03:50:30,076 --> 03:50:35,764
MATT: However, you didn't find the vault, didn't
find Kima's stuff, and a number of escaped

3487
03:50:35,764 --> 03:50:43,107
individuals from this are out and at large. We'll
end today's game on that note.

3488
03:50:43,107 --> 03:50:46,217
LIAM: Percy, I need Bad News to be my other foot
now.

3489
03:50:46,217 --> 03:50:50,914
MARISHA: Yeah, you should have-- you need, like, a
sweet pimp swagger now.

3490
03:50:50,914 --> 03:50:54,697
MATT: So that went a little long, guys. Thank you
for your-- for hanging out, but that was an

3491
03:50:54,697 --> 03:50:58,186
intense session. Some climactic moments there.

3492
03:50:58,186 --> 03:51:01,932
LIAM: Are you sure you guys don't want to send in
a bulette, right now?

3493
03:51:01,932 --> 03:51:05,649
MARISHA: Yeah, or maybe, like, you know, a black
ooze. You wanna do that?

3494
03:51:05,649 --> 03:51:07,259
SAM: Wow, guys.

3495
03:51:07,259 --> 03:51:09,193
ZAC: That was fucking intense.

3496
03:51:09,193 --> 03:51:10,569
MATT: That was crazy!

3497
03:51:10,569 --> 03:51:16,229
ZAC: Guys. Riveting. And exhausting. Are you guys
tired?

3498
03:51:16,229 --> 03:51:17,550
ALL: Yes.

3499
03:51:17,550 --> 03:51:20,036
ZAC: No dancing tonight, guys, get over it.

3500
03:51:20,036 --> 03:51:21,546
ASHLEY: Sorry it went late.

3501
03:51:21,546 --> 03:51:23,547
LAURA: That went so long, I'm sorry guys.

3502
03:51:23,547 --> 03:51:28,868
ZAC: No, they are happy that you went late. They
want you to stay forever.

3503
03:51:28,868 --> 03:51:30,449
MATT: That was nuts.

3504
03:51:30,449 --> 03:51:36,918
ZAC: So I wanted to make a couple announcements of
people that helped out tonight. Not just donators,

3505
03:51:36,918 --> 03:51:41,171
oh so-- I'm gonna read off a couple of people who
helped out first and then we're gonna start off

3506
03:51:41,171 --> 03:51:47,467
reading off people who donated to the charity. If
you want us to read off who you are and your

3507
03:51:47,467 --> 03:51:51,220
message to the Critical Role crew, you still have
time to donate, 'cause I'll start at the bottom

3508
03:51:51,220 --> 03:51:57,507
and work my way up. So if the mods could post the
link to, you know, the command for Critical Role

3509
03:51:57,507 --> 03:52:03,593
and you guys'll see there's a link there to
donate. Donate to 826LA. Every little bit helps

3510
03:52:03,593 --> 03:52:10,904
these guys a lot and it would be really helpful to
the stream and the show. These guys have been

3511
03:52:10,904 --> 03:52:16,179
working really hard and Matt puts in a ton of time
and to show your support, go donate to the charity

3512
03:52:16,179 --> 03:52:19,523
and we'll get to your messages.

3513
03:52:19,641 --> 03:52:22,893
Okay, so first off, I'm gonna thank
the_Duganator8--

3514
03:52:22,893 --> 03:52:24,998
MARISHA: Yes! Was it the Duganator's birthday?

3515
03:52:24,998 --> 03:52:26,086
ZAC: Yes!

3516
03:52:26,086 --> 03:52:29,206

3517
03:52:29,206 --> 03:52:32,914

us to you. We wish it was our birthdays, so...

3519
03:52:35,839 --> 03:52:37,557
ZAC: Way to not use the copywritten one.

3520
03:52:37,557 --> 03:52:40,498
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah, way to not use the
copywritten one, yeah.

3521
03:52:40,498 --> 03:52:46,130
ZAC: Arislan and Alduin and JakeBoudreaux and
Negihama and Duganator8 were all the ones that

3522
03:52:46,130 --> 03:52:48,118
pitched in to buy dinner for you guys.

3523
03:52:48,118 --> 03:52:53,837
MARISHA: Thank you guys, we love it, cupcakes!
Happy birthday.

pull up these donations and messages, if you

3531
03:53:31,164 --> 03:53:37,348

we'll probably have more as we get to the top. So
