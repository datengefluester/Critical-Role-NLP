1
00:00:00,315 --> 00:00:04,407
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

2
00:00:04,407 --> 00:00:12,582
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. And get
the somewhat adjusted, altered countdown to us

3
00:00:12,582 --> 00:00:13,506
going live.

4
00:00:13,506 --> 00:00:14,845
TRAVIS: False start, offense.

5
00:00:14,845 --> 00:00:20,491
MATT: It's great. But yes, welcome. We have just a
couple of announcements to do tonight. Nothing too

6
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:22,486
long and crazy. First and--

7
00:00:22,486 --> 00:00:23,920
SAM: Mine's really long, Matt.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,763
MATT: Okay, Sam's is really long. Speaking of
which, let's go ahead and get us into our

9
00:00:27,763 --> 00:00:29,578
wonderful sponsor for tonight, Loot Crate.

10
00:00:29,578 --> 00:00:30,669
ALL: Loot Crate!

11
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:33,333
MATT: Thank you so much, Loot Crate. Sam, if you
want to tell us a little about Loot Crate.

12
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:38,457
SAM: You guys, Loot Crate. The theme this month is
Magical. Brands included Dr. Strange, Fantastic

13
00:00:38,457 --> 00:00:43,840
Beasts and Where to Find Them, and more. Please
make a special call out to the below Dr. Strange

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,694
Q-Fig Loot Crate has announced will be in this
month's crate. I just did.

15
00:00:48,694 --> 00:00:50,655
(laughter)

16
00:00:50,655 --> 00:00:59,609
SAM: But tonight I've prepared, because we all
need just some theater today. I've prepared

17
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:01,168
for us a small radio play.

18
00:01:01,168 --> 00:01:02,610
ALL: Ooh!

19
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,298
SAM: I'd like each of you to read a part in.

20
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:06,919
LIAM: Pass 'em down, pass 'em down.

21
00:01:06,919 --> 00:01:11,807
SAM: Pass it down, keep passing it down. I didn't
know Ashley was going to be here, so, Ashley, you

22
00:01:11,807 --> 00:01:13,703
can read with Travis. You are both--

23
00:01:13,703 --> 00:01:15,186
MARISHA: Sam!

24
00:01:15,186 --> 00:01:16,320
SAM: You are both doing it together.

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,477
MARISHA: The first line--

26
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:26,433
SAM: Guys, calm down. It's sort of a Dust Bowl
type of a play I wrote.

27
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:27,560
MARISHA: Sam!

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,146
SAM: I wrote a play, okay?

29
00:01:29,146 --> 00:01:30,919
MARISHA: Do I have to say this?

30
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:35,735
SAM: Yes! You do! Come on! Guys, okay, I'll be
reading stage direction, Taliesin is playing

31
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:40,349
Junior, Marisha is playing Mama, Liam is Pa, Laura
is playing Sam Riegel.

32
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:48,268
And Travis and Laura are-- Travis and Ashley
are the radio sound effects duo. Let's see how

33
00:01:48,268 --> 00:01:56,191
this goes. August, 1929, the Badlands, South
Dakota. Lights up on the McCallister Farm. Mama, a

34
00:01:56,191 --> 00:02:00,898
sturdy, country woman, comes in from the windy,
dusty farm and slams the door. Sound effects!

35
00:02:00,898 --> 00:02:02,144
ASHLEY: (wind noises)

36
00:02:02,144 --> 00:02:03,177
TRAVIS: (ke-thunk)

37
00:02:03,177 --> 00:02:07,377
MARISHA: "Junior? Junior! Git yer slowpoke,
molasses ass down here."

38
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:12,587
SAM: Oh! That's me! Enter Junior, a simpleton,
down the stairs.

39
00:02:12,587 --> 00:02:14,915
TRAVIS: (ke-kunk, ke-kunk, ke-kunk, ke-kunk)

40
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:16,345
SAM: Good sound effects, guys.

41
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:23,830
TALIESIN: "Sorry I didn't do no chores, Mama. I'm
a simpleton!" What are you doing to me?

42
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,420
MARISHA: "You'll be sorry when I run this
cat-o-nine tails over your rear end."

43
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,667
ASHLEY: (whip sound)

44
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,390
SAM: Yeah, good sound effect, good sound effect.

45
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,121
TALIESIN: "It ain't my fault because school was
late because Teacher Sally died the evening before last."

46
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,898
SAM: Come on! Project, <i>project!</i>

47
00:02:36,898 --> 00:02:44,180
TALIESIN: "It ain't my fault school was
late because, well, Teacher Sally died this

48
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,653
"evening before last."

49
00:02:45,653 --> 00:02:52,500
MARISHA: "Not sweet, sweet Sally. My rear end, I'm
going to miss her. What did her in?" I don't even

50
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,621
know what the fuck--

51
00:02:53,621 --> 00:02:56,817
SAM: Enter Pa, a drunk. He smashes a beer bottle
against the family cat.

52
00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:57,685
LIAM: (thumps)

53
00:02:57,685 --> 00:02:58,627
LAURA: No, you're not the sound effects.

54
00:02:58,627 --> 00:02:59,520
TRAVIS: (glass shattering)

55
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,261
ASHLEY: (cat snarling)

56
00:03:00,261 --> 00:03:01,073
SAM: There you go.

57
00:03:01,073 --> 00:03:02,076
(laughter)

58
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:07,160
LIAM: "Oh, same thing that kills us all around
here. Dust poisoning. As we all know the Dust

59
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:12,057
"Bowl's full of radioactive dust. It melts your
face clean off of the bone."

60
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:18,252
MARISHA: "It's true. And dust ebola is the second
leading cause of death in the dust bowl. My rear

61
00:03:18,252 --> 00:03:23,029
"end just can't stand this dusty dust. Deadly
dust."

62
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:26,959
SAM: It should be noted that the playwright did no
historical research on the Dust Bowl.

63
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,359
(laughter)

64
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:31,844
SAM: Junior.

65
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:35,751
TALIESIN: "Here, Ma, I found your bagpipes to play
at the dust funeral."

66
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:40,349
ASHLEY: (awful yet great impression of bagpipes)

67
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:41,721
(laughter)

68
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,035
SAM: Good sound effects!

69
00:03:43,035 --> 00:03:50,151
LIAM: "Oh, Lord, what will we ever do with this
dust?!"

70
00:03:50,151 --> 00:03:54,262
SAM: Enter Sam Riegel, a strapping traveling
salesman from the big city, played by Laura.

71
00:03:54,262 --> 00:04:01,639
LAURA: "Hi, folks! Handsome Sam Riegel here. Only
thing more handsome than me is this here Loot

72
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:05,749
"Crate, featuring X-X-X."

73
00:04:05,749 --> 00:04:13,428
SAM: I was supposed to put in actual stuff. Promo
link "lootcrate.com/criticalrole." Keep going.

74
00:04:13,428 --> 00:04:16,316
(laughter)

75
00:04:16,316 --> 00:04:23,024
LAURA: "Once you enjoy the geeky gear inside, you
can use the box to clean up, well, all this dust!"

76
00:04:23,024 --> 00:04:30,602
MARISHA: "Can it be? A box than can cure our woes
and pick us up back onto our dusty rear ends?"

77
00:04:30,602 --> 00:04:32,057
What's with-- why?

78
00:04:32,057 --> 00:04:33,667
ALL: Hooray!

79
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:36,632
SAM: And so the McCallisters used a dusty old
vacuum cleaner--

80
00:04:36,632 --> 00:04:40,146
TRAVIS: (vacuum noises)

81
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:45,005
SAM: And their Loot Crates to clean up all the
dust in the Dust Bowl. Thus saving their farm and

82
00:04:45,005 --> 00:04:47,188
the American Dream.

83
00:04:47,188 --> 00:04:50,344
(cheering)

84
00:04:50,344 --> 00:04:53,585
TRAVIS: Holy shit. It keeps getting better.

85
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,261
SAM: I'm a playwright, guys.

86
00:04:56,261 --> 00:05:00,918
MARISHA: A few on the fly rewrites there.

87
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:05,660
MATT: And you know, based on our viewership
tonight, it's a pretty good opening night.

88
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,651
(laughter)

89
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:09,706
MATT: Far better than most playwrights.

90
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:10,600
SAM: Thank you.

91
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,762
MATT: So, well done, Sam.

92
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:12,985
SAM: Good sound effects, guys.

93
00:05:12,985 --> 00:05:14,365
LAURA: Yeah, that was good sound effects.

94
00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:23,123
MATT: Awesome. Well. Next up, we have a quick
announcement that a special guest is going to come

95
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:26,708
in here and tag me out. We have Brian Foster. Go
ahead and tag. Boom!

96
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,583
(cheering)

97
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:35,951
BRIAN: Hello, hello, hello. Man, it's been a Chris
Hardweek, hasn't it?

98
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:37,688
ALL: Oh!

99
00:05:37,688 --> 00:05:45,441
BRIAN: There's a giant note here that says, "Kill
Grog. He's gotten too powerful." All right, so

100
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:50,522
we're going to talk about Talks Machina, which is
the new Critical Role after-slash-talk show.

101
00:05:50,522 --> 00:05:53,389
(cheering)

102
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:57,091
BRIAN: We've all been working on this along with a
lot of people at Geek &amp; Sundry for a super long

103
00:05:57,091 --> 00:06:02,684
time. So we're super excited about it. It's going
to start this Tuesday at 7:00pm. You can watch it

104
00:06:02,684 --> 00:06:07,821
on Twitch for the first four episodes, and then
those are going to be available on the VOD for

105
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:12,292
Twitch and on the Geek &amp; Sundry website. You can
also watch it on a website called

106
00:06:12,292 --> 00:06:14,418
Pro-ject Alpha dot com.

107
00:06:14,418 --> 00:06:16,165
(laughter)

108
00:06:16,165 --> 00:06:26,026
BRIAN: We're going to have two or three members of
the cast on every single week. Mostly from this

109
00:06:26,026 --> 00:06:32,771
cast. We're also going to have celebrity guests--
previous guests from Critical Role. We're going to

110
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:39,013
let them back out. We're going to let 'em back
out. And we're also going to have some

111
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:41,555
super fans that are going to be able to be on the
show. We're going to get all dirty and nerdy.

112
00:06:41,593 --> 00:06:46,023
We're going to talk about the previous week's
episode. We're going to give away prizes every

113
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:52,040
single week. We're also going to have the
near-impossible task of picking out your fanart

114
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:58,840
and gifs-- I said "gifs" because "jif" sounds so
mushy. It's "gif", right? Yeah, yeah.

115
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,498
MARISHA: Yeah, living language; we decide.

116
00:07:01,498 --> 00:07:07,139
BRIAN: It's been decided and decreed, ladies and
gentlemen. So here's what we need from you-- We're

117
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:11,096
going to give out a bunch of Critical Role merch,
we're going to give out a bunch of D&amp;D merch,

118
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:13,286
we're going to give out stuff from our friends at
Wyrmwood.

119
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:16,034
(cheering)

120
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:20,359
BRIAN: We're going to give out, it says here, a
shirtless picture of Travis Willingham riding a

121
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:21,513
mechanical bull.

122
00:07:21,513 --> 00:07:22,724
LAURA: Oh!

123
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:24,356
TRAVIS: The photoshoot is still TBD.

124
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:35,387
BRIAN: Oh, I see. Yes. (singing) He's waiting for
an open tanning bed. Because we get so many--

125
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:41,694
there's so many thousands of tweets every Thursday
night that go out about this amazing and weird and

126
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:50,682
horrible show, we are asking that if you guys want
to tweet a question for us to ask the cast live on

127
00:07:50,682 --> 00:07:54,472
the air, we're asking that you tweet
@TalksMachina, which is the official Twitter

128
00:07:54,472 --> 00:07:59,954
handle for our show. And use the hashtag
#AskTalksMachina because that way we can track

129
00:07:59,954 --> 00:08:06,836
'em, make sure we get as many of your questions as
we can on the show. Send your fanart and gifs to

130
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:13,521
talksmachina@gmail.com anytime between Thursday
nights during the show and Tuesdays at 9:00am

131
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:18,393
Pacific Time. We're trying to feature fanart and
gifs from each week's episodes since we're going

132
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:24,584
to be talking about those episodes on the show on
Tuesdays. So send those in. That's it. We're going

133
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:32,852
to see you guys this Tuesday at 7:00pm on Twitch
and Pro-ject Alpha dot com. Until then, it's high noon!

134
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:40,375
(laughter)

135
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:43,121
SAM: Fix your mic there, Matt.

136
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:46,069
TRAVIS: Yes! Look at the jaw, it's so forced.

137
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:57,259
MATT: Motherfucker. Didn't get enough of that at
BlizzCon this past weekend. Okay, then. (laughs)

138
00:08:57,259 --> 00:08:58,867
Thank you, Brian Foster.

139
00:08:58,867 --> 00:09:02,027
ASHLEY: That guy's hot! Is he single?

140
00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:03,493
MATT: He's taken, unfortunately.

141
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:04,739
ASHLEY: Aw.

142
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:10,731
MATT: By you? All right, so, anyway we have one
more quick announcement, Liam, if you want to take

143
00:09:10,797 --> 00:09:11,705
over for this.

144
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:15,643
LIAM: Well it's not really an announcement, I'm
just a willing accomplice with one of my favorite

145
00:09:15,643 --> 00:09:20,515
artist buddies. Sedona Parnham has sent something
she has made specifically for Sam Riegel.

146
00:09:20,515 --> 00:09:22,807
SAM: Oh, me? Oh. Why?

147
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:26,730
LIAM: So it was sent to me on the sly, because
you're so dear. To all of us.

148
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,821
SAM: Is it a radio play?

149
00:09:28,821 --> 00:09:36,830
LIAM: So dear. So charming. And now you will be
well-rested. Please accept this gift.

150
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,145
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm so excited.

151
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:40,476
SAM: What is this? Do I read it?

152
00:09:40,476 --> 00:09:44,649
LIAM: No, don't read-- it's nothing to read. Just
open it up and show us all what you find.

153
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:46,342
TALIESIN: Oh, my--

154
00:09:46,342 --> 00:09:49,170
(laughter)

155
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,190
SAM: It's a pillow case. It's a pillow case.

156
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,723
MARISHA: It's size appropriate.

157
00:09:53,723 --> 00:10:00,166
SAM: The chest hair, the nipples. It's adorable,
guys.

158
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,794
LAURA: He's so cute!

159
00:10:01,794 --> 00:10:05,687
SAM: This is 400 count Egyptian cotton here.

160
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:07,835
(laughter)

161
00:10:07,835 --> 00:10:11,448
LIAM: There's only one other copy of that
pillowcase, and it is mine.

162
00:10:11,448 --> 00:10:14,372
(laughter)

163
00:10:14,372 --> 00:10:15,361
TRAVIS: Gross. Gross.

164
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:17,366
SAM: Are we going to be sleeping on the same
pillows at night?

165
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,437
LIAM: Yeah. I mean, we need a blanket as well.

166
00:10:19,437 --> 00:10:28,650
ALL: (singing) Somewhere out there, 
(simultaneous) someone's saying a prayer!
(simultaneous) if love will see us through!

167
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,291
TRAVIS: You're in different parts of the song.

168
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,481
MATT: For all you Critters who are under the age
of 35, you have know idea what we're singing. I'm sorry.

169
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:36,348
TRAVIS: Go watch American Tail and Land Before
Time.

170
00:10:36,348 --> 00:10:42,975
LIAM: So that was from Sedona who is known as
@anodesu on Twitter. She's done a ton of great art

171
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,040
for this show. She's one of my favorites; she's a
buddy now.

172
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,945
SAM: She's my favorite now.

173
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:51,380
MATT: Well, thank you, guys. Unless you have
anything else to kick forward, I think we jump

174
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,838
back into the chaos of the City of Brass and the
elemental plane of fire on tonight's episode of

175
00:10:55,838 --> 00:10:57,918
Critical Role.

176
00:10:57,918 --> 00:12:29,208
[dramatic music]

177
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:38,666
MATT: Hello, and welcome back, everyone. Sorry,
you waited too long, Taliesin. So, last we left off,

178
00:12:38,731 --> 00:12:45,904
Vox Machina was slowly making their way toward the
final confrontation with Thordak, the Cinder King,

179
00:12:45,904 --> 00:12:50,593
as well as the end of the Chroma Conclave,
hopefully, or the end of modern Tal'Dorei as

180
00:12:50,593 --> 00:12:55,594
we know it. One way or the other. You found
yourselves preparing Fort Daxio for some sort of a

181
00:12:55,594 --> 00:13:02,088
plot to draw Thordak out. In the process, you took
the rest of your intrepid adventurers to the fire

182
00:13:02,088 --> 00:13:07,189
elemental plane in search of the final Vestige
that you had referred to yourself by the

183
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:15,610
androsphinx earlier in your adventure. Upon
arriving here, you spoke with a number of efreet

184
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:21,045
that ran the outskirts of the City of Brass.
Entered, found yourselves immediately traced and

185
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:27,158
followed, and discovering that the society here
is, well, very different than ones that you're

186
00:13:27,158 --> 00:13:33,910
used to. You managed to barely escape a
confrontation in an alleyway with two efreet. You

187
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:40,854
escaped on the path of two seemingly recent-made
allies for the time being, led into their

188
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:46,458
establishment in which jewelry is crafted, and
with a plot to hopefully find whoever this fire

189
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:54,115
giant is that holds onto the Plate of the
Dawnmartyr. Many of you allowed chains to be

190
00:13:54,115 --> 00:13:59,145
affixed to your neck and wrists so you could pass
as slaves in a society where they're relatively

191
00:13:59,145 --> 00:14:10,197
normal under the efreet that run the city. Your
new friends, Senokir and Uten, are to help guide

192
00:14:10,197 --> 00:14:18,436
you in the direction of the next part of your
venture. So. Picking up where we left off. You

193
00:14:18,436 --> 00:14:22,335
guys have been led out into this main street,
watching the giant lava fountain that pours out

194
00:14:22,335 --> 00:14:28,426
into this deeply carved pit in the center of the
ground. You see flickers of flame that

195
00:14:28,426 --> 00:14:32,394
occasionally burst out between the various bits of
stonework that make up the floor in the center of

196
00:14:32,394 --> 00:14:38,498
the streets here. Looking up into the sky, you can
see the deep reddish-orange hue of the skyline and

197
00:14:38,498 --> 00:14:45,564
one burning hot sun in the sky that doesn't seem
to move from its position, but grows slightly

198
00:14:45,564 --> 00:14:54,828
dimmer as the day goes on. You are all led out
into the street with Senokir and Uten leading you

199
00:14:54,828 --> 00:15:01,608
out into the main area. Senokir turns back to the
rest of you, this slight half-smile on his face.

200
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:13,171
"So, we are to find our way to the first giant you
requested. This was the one named Whaska. Is that correct?"

201
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:16,417
LAURA: (whispering) Whaska. (louder) Mm-hmm.

202
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:19,757
MATT: "Let us find our way to the Zenith Forge
where he does most of his work."

203
00:15:19,757 --> 00:15:21,084
TRAVIS: Forge?

204
00:15:21,084 --> 00:15:29,197
MATT: "Zenith Forge. Now come. Follow me." And he
tugs the chains with a sudden burst and pulls you

205
00:15:29,197 --> 00:15:38,880
along. As you begin walking, he begins to talk
about how: "Whaska is one of the few giants that

206
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:46,662
"still maintains the privilege of freedom. There
was a coup within their people a few years ago,

207
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:54,548
"seemingly orchestrated by some of their own. As
such most of the fire giants in the city

208
00:15:54,548 --> 00:16:01,728
"either were cast out or were placed in chains. And
the few that remain, one of which you'll speak

209
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:11,295
"with on this day, is one of the ones that sold
them out. So. I hope you have your questions ready."

210
00:16:11,295 --> 00:16:13,809
TRAVIS: Yeah, for you? Shitloads.

211
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:14,794
MATT: "Shh."

212
00:16:14,794 --> 00:16:15,641
TRAVIS: Sorry.

213
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,149
MATT: Don't talk to your master in public.

214
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:21,400
TRAVIS: That was hot.

215
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,164
(laughter)

216
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,440
LIAM: I feel like you're working some shit out,
here.

217
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,436
(laughter)

218
00:16:28,499 --> 00:16:29,986
TRAVIS: Do we have a safety word?

219
00:16:29,986 --> 00:16:32,136
MATT: You did not establish one.

220
00:16:32,136 --> 00:16:34,506
(laughter)

221
00:16:34,506 --> 00:16:36,392
LAURA: Oh, no.

222
00:16:36,392 --> 00:16:37,752
TRAVIS: (weakly) Oklahoma.

223
00:16:37,752 --> 00:16:39,195
(laughter)

224
00:16:39,195 --> 00:16:40,696
ALL: (singing) Oklahoma.

225
00:16:40,696 --> 00:16:49,221
MATT: You're led through a multitude of streets,
led along the outside of this large place that he

226
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:53,902
points out to you that he refers to as the
furnace. "That is where the Charcoal Palace exists

227
00:16:53,902 --> 00:16:58,246
"and the sultan of the entire city. We won't be
going there."

228
00:16:58,246 --> 00:17:00,273
LAURA: The Chuckle Palace?

229
00:17:00,273 --> 00:17:01,408
SAM: The Chocolate Palace.

230
00:17:01,408 --> 00:17:05,793
MATT: "The Charcoal Palace. You are listening; you
are not supposed to speak."

231
00:17:05,793 --> 00:17:07,086
LAURA: (whispers) I'm sorry.

232
00:17:07,086 --> 00:17:09,202
LIAM: Like charcoal.

233
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:20,905
MATT: "Charcoal Palace." The air itself here, as
you're spending more time outside-- and the

234
00:17:20,905 --> 00:17:24,680
interior of these buildings aren't meant to
detract heat or cool either. Most if not all of

235
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,430
the denizens here are well-tempered against the
heat. As you guys are being dragged along, I need

236
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:34,307
all of you who do not have fire resistance to go
ahead and make another constitution saving throw.

237
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:36,372
TALIESIN: Damn it.

238
00:17:36,372 --> 00:17:38,878
TRAVIS: I'm a master of a good burn. Does that
give me fire resistance?

239
00:17:38,878 --> 00:17:40,827
MATT: Nope! So I think that you don't have to
worry about it.

240
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:45,573
MARISHA: I had cast fire resistance on me.

241
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:46,873
MATT: Yes, and how long does that last?

242
00:17:46,873 --> 00:17:48,505
MARISHA: It lasts an hour. Has it been an hour?

243
00:17:48,505 --> 00:17:50,166
MATT: It's been about an hour now, so that's
past.

244
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,229
MARISHA: I'll recast.

245
00:17:51,229 --> 00:17:52,047
MATT: Okay.

246
00:17:52,047 --> 00:17:53,105
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a reroll.

247
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,162
SAM: This is a saving throw, or--?

248
00:17:54,162 --> 00:17:55,497
MATT: A saving throw, yes. Constitution saving
throw.

249
00:17:55,497 --> 00:18:00,805
SAM: Am I allowed to inspire myself on a saving
throw?

250
00:18:00,805 --> 00:18:02,200
MATT: Only on ability checks, sorry.

251
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,154
SAM: 11.

252
00:18:04,154 --> 00:18:04,957
MATT: 11, okay.

253
00:18:04,957 --> 00:18:05,840
TALIESIN: 16.

254
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,049
MATT: All right. Vex?

255
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:08,987
LAURA: Oh, 15.

256
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:09,852
MATT: All right.

257
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:12,960
ASHLEY: Seven. I burn to death.

258
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,798
MATT: All of you manage for the most part to
resist the heat. Your sweat is starting to become

259
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:24,359
more of a prevalent downpour across your face.
Pike, you take a point of exhaustion.

260
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,963
ALL: Oh no!

261
00:18:25,963 --> 00:18:27,775
ASHLEY: I'm just feeling so tired.

262
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:30,060
MATT: So you are currently at disadvantage on
ability checks.

263
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,397
MARISHA: The heat makes you lethargic.

264
00:18:31,397 --> 00:18:32,728
TRAVIS: I'm very familiar with that.

265
00:18:32,728 --> 00:18:33,812
LAURA: Well, it does.

266
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,571
MATT: Travis can work you through the exhaustion
levels.

267
00:18:35,571 --> 00:18:36,530
TRAVIS: Yeah.

268
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:43,072
MATT: Heading past the buildings and constructs
you see these spires that come into these rounded

269
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:51,908
point towers all made from some colored glass,
some dark greens and blacks. You begin to see

270
00:18:51,908 --> 00:19:00,728
there are deep, carved, and well-manufactured
waterways or what would be considered waterways in

271
00:19:00,728 --> 00:19:09,505
other cities. Except here, the actual molten lava
from the Sea of Fire pours through. So there are

272
00:19:09,505 --> 00:19:18,365
large bridges that lead over these constantly
bubbling and churning long aqueducts that are

273
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,797
filled with molten rock.

274
00:19:19,797 --> 00:19:21,090
TRAVIS: In the ground or raised or--?

275
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:25,877
MATT: In the ground. Similar to how you see most
city aqueducts constructed, except for the Sea of

276
00:19:25,877 --> 00:19:32,743
Fire spills into it. Anything going over there is
uncomfortable as the heat grows astronomically as

277
00:19:32,743 --> 00:19:36,189
you pass over each bridge and the air itself
becomes more sulfurous. And you find yourselves

278
00:19:36,189 --> 00:19:44,173
coughing autonomically as the fumes reach your
lungs. You begin to pass by--

279
00:19:44,173 --> 00:19:48,754
LIAM: We're walking out in public at this point,
right? And there's people about? We see other

280
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:49,907
beings about?

281
00:19:49,907 --> 00:19:57,629
MATT: You do. You see as the sun which--and you've
been here for two hours now so you have some time.

282
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:05,042
It's still very busy in the city. And as you pass
by, you see many efreet on their own business.

283
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:09,111
Some coasting at different levels of height, some
just traversing through. Occasionally you come

284
00:20:09,111 --> 00:20:16,105
across strange, horned devil-like entities that
work, walk in clusters.

285
00:20:16,105 --> 00:20:19,931
LIAM: So, question, because I put on the Ring of
Invisibility before we left.

286
00:20:19,931 --> 00:20:20,913
MATT: Yes.

287
00:20:20,913 --> 00:20:25,271
LIAM: But Senokir, I think, might have chuckled
when I gave my sister a wet willie. So as we're

288
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:31,574
walking, and I've got the ring on, as we pass
people I'm doing this and looking to see if anyone

289
00:20:31,574 --> 00:20:33,389
is reacting to that.

290
00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:38,015
MATT: No one else reacts except for Senokir. Who
looks back towards you with this--

291
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,535
(laughter)

292
00:20:41,535 --> 00:20:43,493
TALIESIN: Oh, God, that face.

293
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:47,294
LAURA: Oh, no, he's so weird.

294
00:20:47,294 --> 00:20:52,473
I can hear you moving around me.

295
00:20:52,473 --> 00:20:53,701
LIAM: (fart noise)

296
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:56,982
LAURA: Blends in with the sulfur; I don't care.

297
00:20:56,982 --> 00:21:07,429
MATT: Being led through the street you eventually
see two large, lithe gray-fleshed creatures that

298
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:14,574
stalk by with these large hooked tails that bend
over in front. You can see barbs sticking out of

299
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:17,207
parts of their body and they move in clusters of
three or four.

300
00:21:17,207 --> 00:21:20,004
LAURA: Wait, were they walking on two feet or--?

301
00:21:20,004 --> 00:21:22,749
MATT: Two feet. They're bipedal. And they're
stalking through--

302
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:24,147
SAM: Three feet.

303
00:21:24,147 --> 00:21:25,757
TRAVIS: With like big-ass scorpion tails?

304
00:21:25,757 --> 00:21:31,868
MATT: It resembles that. The more you push into
the city, the more diverse the populace becomes.

305
00:21:31,868 --> 00:21:39,358
And you do see the occasional human, the
occasional elf, not being subjugated, though they

306
00:21:39,358 --> 00:21:46,636
do usually carry some sort of a bodyguard or a
handful of servants at their side as well. But you

307
00:21:46,636 --> 00:21:51,765
do see devils walking amongst the people here. And
many, many efreet that are all walking the streets

308
00:21:51,765 --> 00:22:01,486
with large scimitars at their side and with a
uniform, a long silk vest of a dull grey charcoal

309
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:07,432
pattern. And it looks to be a pendant that hangs
around their neck that constantly churns with a

310
00:22:07,432 --> 00:22:12,942
flame. And it's a uniform for each of these, and
you get the sense as they walk around singularly

311
00:22:12,942 --> 00:22:18,115
or in pairs, that these probably act as the
patrol, as the guard of the city.

312
00:22:18,115 --> 00:22:21,014
TRAVIS: Those that are walkin' around that don't
like have a bodyguard and don't seem to be

313
00:22:21,014 --> 00:22:26,160
enslaved, are they still wearing that white and
gold cloak-y thing that our strange bit is

314
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,010
wearing?

315
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,937
MATT: No. They are very diverse in their attire.

316
00:22:28,937 --> 00:22:30,367
TRAVIS: Really?

317
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:39,214
MATT: You get the sense that at least the outfits
they're wearing is their signature outfit. But you

318
00:22:39,214 --> 00:22:44,926
also have a hard time grasping what the cultural
intricacies are of the City of Brass. Being that

319
00:22:44,926 --> 00:22:48,124
you're Grog.

320
00:22:48,124 --> 00:22:49,831
TRAVIS: Hey, man.

321
00:22:49,831 --> 00:22:54,637
MATT: As you're passing by these various aspects--
do you have a question?

322
00:22:54,637 --> 00:22:57,526
LAURA: Oh, I just wanted to whisper: Vax?

323
00:22:57,526 --> 00:22:59,151
LIAM: (coughs)

324
00:22:59,151 --> 00:23:01,723
LAURA: Can you pick these locks as we're walking?

325
00:23:01,723 --> 00:23:04,415
LIAM: (softly) Yeah.

326
00:23:04,415 --> 00:23:07,316
LAURA: Do it then. Subtly.

327
00:23:07,316 --> 00:23:13,883
LIAM: I will stealthily pick my sister's locks.

328
00:23:13,883 --> 00:23:20,088
MATT: Okay. As you guys are walking past, and at
this point Senokir is talking and he mentions off

329
00:23:20,088 --> 00:23:26,254
to the side, "We are now passing the street of
artisans and the city market. This is what we call

330
00:23:26,254 --> 00:23:31,940
"the Pyraklum. This is where we're going to find
Whaska. This is where we're going to find the

331
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:37,387
"Zenith Forge and hopefully the end of your
journey. But we can work out the specifics later."

332
00:23:37,387 --> 00:23:39,173
As this is happening, I need you to make a sleight
of hand roll.

333
00:23:39,173 --> 00:23:40,667
LIAM: Get behind Grog.

334
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:43,692
SAM: (whispers) Sleight of hand roll, boy!

335
00:23:43,692 --> 00:23:46,070
LIAM: Well, I'm going to Luck that sucker.

336
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,254
LAURA: Oh, God.

337
00:23:47,254 --> 00:23:54,249
LIAM: It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. It's a
20.

338
00:23:54,249 --> 00:23:57,310
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a lockpicking
check.

339
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:02,150
LIAM: Okay. Okay, that's fine as well. That's 25.

340
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:11,357
MATT: Okay. It takes you the better part of about
four or five blocks to very carefully, walking

341
00:24:11,357 --> 00:24:14,421
with your sister, keeping in pace with her gait,
making sure not to rustle the chains or anything

342
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:22,826
to distract Senokir or Uten as they walk along--
and Uten is being very, you know, very careful

343
00:24:22,826 --> 00:24:25,479
with his watch. Not just on you, but on the city
overall. It's not like they're, you know, honed in

344
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:30,270
on you per se, but very observant of the
atmosphere. And you get the sense that Uten

345
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:38,448
definitely, as far as the partnership goes, seems
to be the more paranoid of the two of them.

346
00:24:38,448 --> 00:24:44,007
However as time goes on you eventually (click)
hear the gentle release of the lock on one of her

347
00:24:44,007 --> 00:24:46,697
arm manacles and then slowly the other.

348
00:24:46,697 --> 00:24:54,392
LIAM: As I trail backwards behind her you hear:
twins, motherfucker!

349
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:55,698
(laughter)

350
00:24:55,698 --> 00:25:04,664
MATT: As you begin to approach a large black and
gray building built from heavy, heavy stones--

351
00:25:04,664 --> 00:25:07,714
MARISHA: Can I talk to Uten a little bit while
we're walking?

352
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,073
TRAVIS: Is she picking your nose?

353
00:25:09,073 --> 00:25:13,314
LIAM: I thought the same thing! It's a scratch, no
pick!

354
00:25:13,314 --> 00:25:22,974
MARISHA: So, do you play tour guide often to
newcomers in this town?

355
00:25:22,974 --> 00:25:32,012
MATT: Uten says, "It is not often that we take
newcomers under our wing like this. Usually they

356
00:25:32,012 --> 00:25:39,114
"are either customers or, well, to be arrested
shortly. So, no, this is probably the first tour

357
00:25:39,114 --> 00:25:44,430
"we've given. Senokir seems to strangely enjoy
it."

358
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,868
MARISHA: Playing tour guide?

359
00:25:46,868 --> 00:25:54,227
MATT: "Apparently!" Motions over and Senokir,
other hand out, is like, "And around this way, you

360
00:25:54,227 --> 00:26:02,076
"can see the Fenstral Spire, which is a wonderful
craft fair that happens once every two weeks!"

361
00:26:02,076 --> 00:26:05,673
Uten goes back to you.

362
00:26:05,673 --> 00:26:07,911
LAURA: He's making shit up as he's walking.

363
00:26:07,911 --> 00:26:14,168
MARISHA: Seems he has quite a love for the City of
Brass. How long have you all been residents here?

364
00:26:14,168 --> 00:26:22,195
MATT: "We've been in business together for about
the better part of ten years. I've only been here

365
00:26:22,195 --> 00:26:29,776
"about 12. It was a very dangerous scavenge to
begin, but at least the laws of the normal world

366
00:26:29,776 --> 00:26:36,863
"do not apply here. I have no idea how long
Senokir's been here. He keeps a lot to himself,

367
00:26:36,863 --> 00:26:38,665
"that one, but I trust him."

368
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:41,157
MARISHA: And your business mainly deals in--

369
00:26:41,157 --> 00:26:47,314
MATT: "Fine jewelry. I showed you our
establishment."

370
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:54,692
MARISHA: Well, as you mentioned, people ending in
arrest, are you bounty hunters?

371
00:26:54,692 --> 00:27:02,966
MATT: "No! I must admit, our life is not as
interesting as you might be expecting, and I am

372
00:27:02,966 --> 00:27:08,100
"sorry for that. I will say, probably should not be
talking so much right now."

373
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:16,571
MARISHA: Sure. Go, slaves! Walk! Forward! Like you
do!

374
00:27:16,571 --> 00:27:18,765
TRAVIS: Why are you talking to us like that?

375
00:27:18,765 --> 00:27:22,542
MARISHA: Because-- shut up, slave! And I smack
Grog with the flail.

376
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:33,598
MATT: Doesn't physically hurt, but emotionally,
there's a scar.

377
00:27:33,598 --> 00:27:35,635
TRAVIS: I'm wounded! I've been gashed open!

378
00:27:35,635 --> 00:27:39,452
MARISHA: Forward march! (whip crack)

379
00:27:39,452 --> 00:27:40,931
TALIESIN: To be fair, he didn't say Oklahoma.

380
00:27:40,931 --> 00:27:42,868
MARISHA: You never said Oklahoma.

381
00:27:42,868 --> 00:27:48,933
TRAVIS: It's dangerous to keep a race car at a red,
I'm just saying, I'm a race car at a fucking red.

382
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:52,703
Pulp Fiction!

383
00:27:52,703 --> 00:28:03,950
MATT: As you continue pushing forward, eventually
you come to that gray building with heavy gray and

384
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:10,201
dark stones. It's large, square in shape, and you
see an oversized chimney that bellows out constant

385
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:15,240
black smoke that pours upward into infinity. There
are a number of stacks like that throughout the

386
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,361
entirety of the city, hundreds that all eventually
bleed together as they all mingle and join in the

387
00:28:21,361 --> 00:28:28,667
atmosphere, whatever this atmosphere is consisting
of. The large doors are partially open, they're

388
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:39,879
about 20 feet tall and about 20 feet as wide as
well. They are made from a very dark wood, but as

389
00:28:39,879 --> 00:28:45,416
you get close, it's just a textured stone. You see
a dull light from the inside.

390
00:28:45,416 --> 00:28:50,481
SAM: Where are we, Master?

391
00:28:50,481 --> 00:29:00,823
MATT: "Welcome to the Zenith Forge. So, once we
enter, I would have to be the one to ask all the

392
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:07,515
"questions, but that would be difficult for us to
do. So the choice is yours. Either we try and find

393
00:29:07,515 --> 00:29:12,470
"a careful way to funnel questions, or we put our
cards on the table and you do the talking."

394
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:22,636
MARISHA: Well, I can alter myself to look like
you, if you can hang back.

395
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:29,236
MATT: "You already look like Uten and other
compatriots. You can still speak, I just want to make

396
00:29:29,236 --> 00:29:34,741
"sure that, well, our slaves don't talk out of
turn."

397
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:35,999
MARISHA: Sure.

398
00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:38,523
TRAVIS: Have you spoken with a fire giant before?

399
00:29:38,523 --> 00:29:46,371
MATT: "It's been a while. Since the upset
socially, I found it best to not deal with them

400
00:29:46,371 --> 00:29:49,930
"outside of a customer-patron relationship."

401
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:54,142
TRAVIS: So weird. Are they good
conversationalists?

402
00:29:54,142 --> 00:29:59,041
MATT: "They're curious."

403
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:05,239
ASHLEY: You seem a little bit nervous. I can't
really tell because you're so strange in a

404
00:30:05,239 --> 00:30:06,541
wonderful way.

405
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:10,756
(laughter)

406
00:30:10,756 --> 00:30:12,852
MATT: "You're sweet, little one."

407
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,488
ASHLEY: Thank you.

408
00:30:14,488 --> 00:30:16,367
MATT: "They're very big."

409
00:30:16,367 --> 00:30:17,856
ASHLEY: Okay.

410
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:26,011
MATT: "And consider that since they kept their
freedom, they're probably rather cunning."

411
00:30:26,011 --> 00:30:28,365
ASHLEY: Bigger than him?

412
00:30:28,365 --> 00:30:30,034
MATT: "You'll see."

413
00:30:30,034 --> 00:30:31,217
ASHLEY: Oh.

414
00:30:31,217 --> 00:30:33,196
MATT: As he begins to tug the chains and pull you
through the doorway.

415
00:30:33,196 --> 00:30:34,704
SAM: Shit. What questions are we asking?

416
00:30:34,704 --> 00:30:39,147
LAURA: I guess we have to ask, like, hey do you
have any cool collections? Do you play cards? Have

417
00:30:39,147 --> 00:30:41,598
you won a lot? Stuff like that.

418
00:30:41,598 --> 00:30:47,208
MARISHA: Yeah. What's going to make him give us
this thing anyway? Do we have anything to give him?

419
00:30:47,266 --> 00:30:50,420
LAURA: Well, aren't we going to try and steal it
once we see it? Or are we really going to try and

420
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,281
purchase it?

421
00:30:51,281 --> 00:30:54,883
TRAVIS: Maybe he's got beef with somebody in the
city and we'll go out and jack 'em up if he'll

422
00:30:54,883 --> 00:30:56,153
tell us where--

423
00:30:56,153 --> 00:31:01,480
LAURA: Or maybe if we see that he has it then we
can challenge him to a game of cards?

424
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,150
MARISHA: Or maybe-- oh!

425
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:07,780
SAM: If we see that he has it. How do we know that
he has it?

426
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,266
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Yeah, he might not have it.

427
00:31:09,266 --> 00:31:13,252
LIAM: You could also chat with him and I could
walk over and take it.

428
00:31:13,252 --> 00:31:15,766
MARISHA: Well maybe he won't know its value.

429
00:31:15,766 --> 00:31:17,806
TRAVIS: It's a suit of armor, though.

430
00:31:17,806 --> 00:31:20,367
LAURA: That he can't fit into because he's huge
and it's for normal people.

431
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:22,929
MARISHA: You still have your Locate Item,
correct?

432
00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:24,129
LAURA: I do! Oh yeah!

433
00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:25,688
SAM: Use it. Now!

434
00:31:25,688 --> 00:31:28,423
LAURA: Okay! I use it.

435
00:31:28,423 --> 00:31:29,767
TALIESIN: Now!

436
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:34,070
MATT: You're going to stop as you're being pulled
into the foyer of this building in chains, and

437
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,605
you're going to begin to cast the spell.

438
00:31:35,605 --> 00:31:37,414
LAURA: Oh, do I have to stop? I can't do it as
we're walking?

439
00:31:37,414 --> 00:31:41,550
MATT: I mean you can do it, it's a visual thing.

440
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,660
TALIESIN: We can hold him.

441
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,921
MARISHA: Senokir, hold?

442
00:31:44,921 --> 00:31:45,951
TALIESIN: One moment!

443
00:31:45,951 --> 00:31:46,877
MARISHA: Senokir?

444
00:31:46,877 --> 00:31:47,989
MATT: "Yes?"

445
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,387
TALIESIN: We're going to--

446
00:31:49,387 --> 00:31:54,021
MARISHA: Hang on, a little bit of preparation on
our end, if you don't mind.

447
00:31:54,021 --> 00:31:58,389
MATT: "All right. Then decide. I mean, if you wish
to progress--"

448
00:31:58,389 --> 00:31:59,989
LAURA: As he's talking I start doing it.

449
00:31:59,989 --> 00:32:03,569
(laughter)

450
00:32:03,569 --> 00:32:13,477
MATT: All right, it's really quick. And you
basically have to pull out your component from the

451
00:32:13,477 --> 00:32:19,822
side there, it's a little twig and you snap it.
And you continue the ritual. All right. You

452
00:32:19,822 --> 00:32:27,705
concentrate for a second as he's talking, and
currently no. You do not sense it.

453
00:32:27,705 --> 00:32:31,224
LAURA: Okay. And that lasts for ten minutes?

454
00:32:31,224 --> 00:32:32,566
MARISHA: But it can point us in the right
direction.

455
00:32:32,566 --> 00:32:34,264
MATT: It lasts for up to ten minutes, yeah.

456
00:32:34,264 --> 00:32:35,795
TRAVIS: Was it 1000 feet?

457
00:32:35,795 --> 00:32:36,742
MATT: 1000 feet.

458
00:32:36,742 --> 00:32:37,913
TRAVIS: Radius.

459
00:32:37,913 --> 00:32:42,756
LAURA: Senokir, how large is the forge?

460
00:32:42,756 --> 00:32:54,131
MATT: "Well, here it's a few rooms. It's large
enough to house Whaska and his servants to

461
00:32:54,131 --> 00:32:56,903
"construct the crafts that they are good at."

462
00:32:56,903 --> 00:32:59,208
TRAVIS: What do they construct?

463
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:08,959
MATT: "As far as I know, arms, armor. You see, fire
giants, they find their sense of self-worth in

464
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:15,589
"society by their craftsmanship. So it's a very
important thing for some."

465
00:33:15,589 --> 00:33:24,433
TRAVIS: Right. Yeah. So, like, wheels? Or like
weapons? Arms? You said arms.

466
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:26,106
MATT: "I said arms."

467
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:29,124
TRAVIS: I have a hard time listening when you talk
like that.

468
00:33:29,124 --> 00:33:32,331
MATT: "Would you like me to speak slower?"

469
00:33:32,331 --> 00:33:33,873
TRAVIS: It might help, you know--

470
00:33:33,873 --> 00:33:35,625
LAURA: No! That's all right.

471
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,609
TALIESIN: No. That's just fine.

472
00:33:37,609 --> 00:33:45,872
MATT: "So. Are you to funnel questions, or do you
wish to ask as a troupe?"

473
00:33:45,872 --> 00:33:50,059
TRAVIS and TALIESIN and LAURA: Funnel them.

474
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:56,779
MATT: "Then decide on your questions now, or
covertly speak once we enter. But we cannot stay

475
00:33:56,779 --> 00:34:00,461
"here in the open and continue to talk long."

476
00:34:00,461 --> 00:34:02,995
SAM: Three questions, quick.

477
00:34:02,995 --> 00:34:05,533
TRAVIS: Yeah. Has he heard of the Dawnmartyr?

478
00:34:05,533 --> 00:34:10,985
TALIESIN: We're looking for a suit of armor he may
have won in a card game.

479
00:34:10,985 --> 00:34:11,880
LAURA: Yeah.

480
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,504
MARISHA: Looking--

481
00:34:13,504 --> 00:34:15,735
TRAVIS: And maybe he didn't win it, but has he
seen it, heard of it--

482
00:34:15,735 --> 00:34:18,391
LAURA: Right. Has he seen a suit of armor--

483
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:20,374
TALIESIN: --that vanished during a card game?

484
00:34:20,374 --> 00:34:22,042
TRAVIS: Question two. Does he know where it may
be?

485
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:23,140
TALIESIN: It has great emotional value.

486
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:27,584
TRAVIS: And question three, if he doesn't want to
tell us where, is there someone that he has an

487
00:34:27,584 --> 00:34:30,569
errand that he need run in exchange for--

488
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:38,521
MARISHA: Do we mention the Suutan bloodline or do
you think that would be bad blood? Is that bad?

489
00:34:38,521 --> 00:34:40,090
TRAVIS: (singing) Hey maybe now we've got--

490
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:41,542
ALL: (singing) --bad blood!

491
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:43,695
LAURA: I don't know. Does Senokir think that that
would be bad?

492
00:34:43,695 --> 00:34:46,780
MARISHA: Is it a bad idea to mention the Suutan
bloodline?

493
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,869
MATT: "I don't know."

494
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:51,367
(laughter)

495
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:54,650
MARISHA: I'm sorry, you just seem to know so much
about this fine city.

496
00:34:54,650 --> 00:35:02,355
MATT: "I know enough. But I don't know of the
bloodline specifically. I've heard of it. You can

497
00:35:02,355 --> 00:35:06,315
"certainly inquire within. That's why we're here!"

498
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:11,175
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's three! Has he heard of them,
does he know where it is and if he won't tell us,

499
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,691
does he need an errand run, and Suutan bloodline.

500
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:16,784
LAURA: Senokir, where are you from originally?

501
00:35:16,784 --> 00:35:24,132
MATT: "These questions aren't pertinent at the
moment."

502
00:35:24,132 --> 00:35:28,070
LAURA: That's true. I was just curious; you're so
interesting.

503
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:33,209
MATT: "Thank you. Now, shall we?"

504
00:35:33,209 --> 00:35:34,662
MARISHA: Yeah.

505
00:35:34,662 --> 00:35:36,101
TALIESIN: Yes, let's.

506
00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:39,569
MATT: Gives a tug on the chain, leads you guys
inside.

507
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:41,010
MARISHA: Sorry, guys.

508
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:46,256
MATT: The interior is very dimly lit. Thankfully,
most of you have some form of darkvision. This is

509
00:35:46,256 --> 00:35:54,661
an open, heavy hall where, in the distance, you
can see four different forges that are burning

510
00:35:54,661 --> 00:36:02,239
simultaneously. They are being fed by a small
trail of the exterior sea of lava that is being

511
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:08,961
funneled into the back corner. Within, you can see
there is a large anvil in the center of the room

512
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:15,527
as well as a number of smaller anvils off to the
side. It appears to be four human-sized figures--

513
00:36:15,527 --> 00:36:20,684
you can make out the shadow of them in the
darkness. They appear to be human or human-like

514
00:36:20,684 --> 00:36:25,942
and they're in the process of moving things
behind. They have troughs of water so they can

515
00:36:25,942 --> 00:36:32,780
quench the heated weapons. There at the center
anvil, you see a large, hulking figure standing.

516
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:40,179
Dark black leather apron across the torso,
currently holding with heavy tongs this large,

517
00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:47,739
superheated piece of metal. Red sparks fly and
illuminate the room with one hit. The second

518
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:52,052
splash of light, as you see this piece of metal
being slowly rotated from side to side. It's

519
00:36:52,052 --> 00:36:57,390
beaten into a heavier shape, the dark metal having
a bladed edge to it, the actual length of it

520
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,353
probably twice the size of Grog.

521
00:36:59,353 --> 00:37:01,948
LIAM: What's the guesstimate on this fella's
height?

522
00:37:01,948 --> 00:37:10,517
MATT: I'd say in the neighborhood of 20 feet. 16
to 20 feet from this vantage point.

523
00:37:10,517 --> 00:37:13,932
LAURA: I guess he's the size of the zombie giants
we fought.

524
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:15,587
MARISHA: In Whitestone.

525
00:37:15,587 --> 00:37:26,537
MATT: (hammering) "So? Go."

526
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:31,356
MARISHA: You want me to talk first? Yeah, no,
okay.

527
00:37:31,356 --> 00:37:33,726
MATT: "Well, you're the one who wants to ask
questions."

528
00:37:33,726 --> 00:37:35,422
MARISHA: Yeah. I got this.

529
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:37,440
TRAVIS and LAURA: Don't fuck it up.

530
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,850
MARISHA: Thanks, guys.

531
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:44,326
SAM: I'm hanging back behind Percy here.

532
00:37:44,326 --> 00:37:47,850
MARISHA: Does this guy have a name, Senokir?

533
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,699
LAURA: Whaska.

534
00:37:49,699 --> 00:38:09,125
MARISHA: Right. Sorry. Good day, fair Whaska.
Strong Whaska.

535
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:14,499
MATT: The last hit strikes the blade before the
hammer pulls back. The currently hunched and

536
00:38:14,499 --> 00:38:22,520
focused fire giant suddenly pulls back, and is
standing. You see the glowing iron metal off the

537
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:29,497
side, gently gliding across the ground and
scraping the stone before it comes to rest at the

538
00:38:29,497 --> 00:38:36,219
side. The giant stands at its full height. You can
see the heavily red bearded chin of itself gently

539
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:44,159
singed on the edges. The dark gray ash-like skin
of the face looks down at you, the eyes glowing

540
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:49,657
with piercing red dots through the shadow. "Yes?"

541
00:38:49,657 --> 00:39:07,495
MARISHA: Hi. I am Keyleth of the Ashari druids.
Sorry. I was curious if I could ask you a few

542
00:39:07,495 --> 00:39:12,798
questions and just take a moment of your time,
which I'm sure is very valuable.

543
00:39:12,798 --> 00:39:20,907
MATT: The metal blade lifts and smacks the ground
with a resounding (ting) sound that rings. All the

544
00:39:20,907 --> 00:39:25,806
other individuals working at the forges stop their
work and look up.

545
00:39:25,806 --> 00:39:30,457
MARISHA: We promise we can make it worth your
time.

546
00:39:30,457 --> 00:39:41,715
MATT: The giant looks back. Does this with his
hand, you hear the wind resistance across his

547
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:48,006
massive arm, and all the rest of the servants
gather their materials and begin to finish what

548
00:39:48,006 --> 00:39:53,578
they're doing quickly and set them aside. As they
begin to go about finishing up their business,

549
00:39:53,578 --> 00:40:02,311
Whaska takes the large, unfinished metal blade and
sets it onto the anvil, puts the tongs down with

550
00:40:02,311 --> 00:40:10,863
this heavy, echoing clack in this large chamber.
The apron gets removed and tossed over the rest of

551
00:40:10,863 --> 00:40:22,455
the materials and tools and walks up (slow, heavy
footsteps) and stands there looking straight down

552
00:40:22,455 --> 00:40:29,928
at all of you, towering over your group, backlit
from the glow of the red forge hue behind him.

553
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:35,165
"You may ask your questions."

554
00:40:35,165 --> 00:40:48,362
MARISHA: We are in search of a piece of armor,
something that holds great weight and many legends

555
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,038
behind it.

556
00:40:50,038 --> 00:40:53,569
MATT: "Then I have probably made it." (chuckles)

557
00:40:53,569 --> 00:41:02,077
MARISHA: Maybe you have. It is called the Plate of
the Dawnmartyr. Are you familiar with this?

558
00:41:02,077 --> 00:41:19,288
MATT: His eyes squint a bit. "I am not familiar
with this. I did not make this armor you ask."

559
00:41:19,288 --> 00:41:31,912
MARISHA: I don't believe it is from this realm,
but it resides here. It was won by a fire giant,

560
00:41:31,912 --> 00:41:34,510
as yourself, in a game of cards.

561
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:40,200
MATT: "A game of cards?"

562
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,338
MARISHA: Or some call them card games.

563
00:41:43,338 --> 00:41:51,911
(sighs and laughter)

564
00:41:51,911 --> 00:41:58,370
MATT: "I may know who you would actually be
seeking."

565
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:03,834
MARISHA: Really? That would be phenomenal
information.

566
00:42:03,834 --> 00:42:16,781
MATT: "This information that would lead you to
this powerful, legendary, sought-after armor you

567
00:42:16,781 --> 00:42:20,749
"seek-- is it worth a lot to you?"

568
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:29,566
MARISHA: Well look, you shouldn't compare it to
you or the things you've made, right? I'm sure--

569
00:42:29,566 --> 00:42:35,838
MATT: He crosses his arms. You hear the clatter of
the metal bracers he has on cling against each

570
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:37,487
other as his muscles tense.

571
00:42:37,487 --> 00:42:42,249
MARISHA: Yes, it's very valuable for us to find
it! Yes.

572
00:42:42,249 --> 00:42:52,680
MATT: "Then--" He begins to walk over to the side
(footsteps) grabs something in the shadow and you

573
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:59,347
hear this scraping sound (creak) of heavy wood
being dragged across stone as he lifts up and

574
00:42:59,347 --> 00:43:07,129
slams in front of you a table. A little bit larger
height than you, you can look just above it, but

575
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:14,504
it's a relatively large table. (boom) "Then make
your offer."

576
00:43:14,504 --> 00:43:20,655
MARISHA: I'm assuming you don't want me to--

577
00:43:20,655 --> 00:43:22,290
TRAVIS: (coughs) Jewels.

578
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:26,233
MARISHA: Right. (quietly) Do we still have all
those jewels?

579
00:43:26,233 --> 00:43:28,562
LAURA: Ask Senokir what he means.

580
00:43:28,562 --> 00:43:42,546
MARISHA: I look at Whaska and I say: Let me confer
with my other masters. Hey, Senokir, what does he

581
00:43:42,546 --> 00:43:44,853
want? What do you think is fair here?

582
00:43:44,853 --> 00:43:52,460
MATT: "Well, usually as a craftsman, they want
something of their craft, perhaps."

583
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:56,072
MARISHA: Craft? They want something-- okay.

584
00:43:56,072 --> 00:43:58,414
MATT: "Or you could always ask."

585
00:43:58,414 --> 00:44:06,506
MARISHA: Sure. Yeah. I'll ask. Whaska!

586
00:44:06,506 --> 00:44:09,183
MATT: "Yes?"

587
00:44:09,183 --> 00:44:15,495
MARISHA: In speaking with my fellow masters, we
want to make sure we give you something that is

588
00:44:15,495 --> 00:44:20,751
fair and desired. Is there anything that you might
have on your wish list?

589
00:44:20,751 --> 00:44:27,921
MATT: He reaches forwards and rummages through a
small pouch that's affixed to the side of his

590
00:44:27,921 --> 00:44:32,032
belt. When I say a small pouch, small by his
comparison, the pouch is about the size of you,

591
00:44:32,032 --> 00:44:37,380
Keyleth, and as his fingers dig around inside you
hear the clanging of heavy metal and various other

592
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:44,740
objects slamming into each other. As he pulls out
some sort of strange, small cylinder, he lifts it

593
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:47,093
to his eye and peers through it.

594
00:44:47,093 --> 00:44:49,499
MARISHA: Oh, he's looking to see what we got!

595
00:44:49,499 --> 00:44:50,678
MATT: Scans through.

596
00:44:50,678 --> 00:44:51,739
LAURA: Oh no!

597
00:44:51,739 --> 00:45:09,130
MATT: "For servants you all walk with many
enchanted, powerful, and desirable affixions to

598
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:10,912
"yourselves."

599
00:45:10,912 --> 00:45:15,442
MARISHA: You are a very intelligent and observant
man.

600
00:45:15,442 --> 00:45:18,238
MATT: Puts away the cylinder into the pouch.

601
00:45:18,238 --> 00:45:21,243
MARISHA: Giant, fire, respected fire giant.

602
00:45:21,243 --> 00:45:34,694
MATT: "Offer me some of what you could give up.
And should it be worth the information you seek,

603
00:45:34,694 --> 00:45:37,738
"it will be yours."

604
00:45:37,738 --> 00:45:47,631
MARISHA: Let me once again confer with my masters
and enchanted servants. Okay, guys, what have we got?

605
00:45:47,631 --> 00:45:49,714
TALIESIN: I've got a Ring of Lightning
Resistance.

606
00:45:49,714 --> 00:45:53,983
LAURA: Don't you have a lot of fucking weapons in
your Bag of Holding?

607
00:45:53,983 --> 00:45:57,982
TRAVIS: They're just <i>normal</i> weapons. There's a
Greatsword of Frenzy, but--

608
00:45:57,982 --> 00:46:00,543
LAURA: That's not bad. Greatsword of Frenzy!

609
00:46:00,543 --> 00:46:09,063
MARISHA: Yeah, Greatsword of Frenzy, yeah.
Whatever. And you said, a ring?

610
00:46:09,063 --> 00:46:11,535
TALIESIN: I've got a Ring of Lightning
Resistance.

611
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:13,922
TRAVIS: Oh! My war mask! My war helmet.

612
00:46:13,922 --> 00:46:15,624
MARISHA: It's not magical, though.

613
00:46:15,624 --> 00:46:16,866
SAM: You built that thing!

614
00:46:16,866 --> 00:46:18,483
LAURA: Oh, that's right, the helmet.

615
00:46:18,483 --> 00:46:19,926
TRAVIS: It's crafted, though. It's like--

616
00:46:19,926 --> 00:46:21,844
SAM: But it's so <i>ugly.</i>

617
00:46:21,844 --> 00:46:25,367
LAURA: Yeah, but it's hideous. And they said they
didn't do it very well.

618
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:26,951
TALIESIN: We did okay.

619
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:29,386
TRAVIS: It's inscripted. It's got my title on the
inside.

620
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:31,147
MARISHA: I've got my magic choker.

621
00:46:31,147 --> 00:46:32,591
SAM: That won't even fit his thumb!

622
00:46:32,591 --> 00:46:36,038
TALIESIN: I would put it on Pinterest. Maybe we
could tell him it's a thimble. We could tell him

623
00:46:36,038 --> 00:46:37,281
it's a handcrafted thimble.

624
00:46:37,281 --> 00:46:40,768
LIAM: How high up is that side?

625
00:46:40,768 --> 00:46:43,921
MATT: It's about eight feet up.

626
00:46:43,921 --> 00:46:45,931
TRAVIS: Don't fucking-- don't even.

627
00:46:45,931 --> 00:46:47,528
LIAM: All right, that's pretty tall, that's pretty
high.

628
00:46:47,528 --> 00:46:51,999
MATT: Yeah, you'd have to leap for that, man.
You're not pickpocketing a giant without some high

629
00:46:51,999 --> 00:46:56,446
rolls. Mind you, you can certainly try. I would
<i>love</i> for you to try.

630
00:46:56,446 --> 00:47:00,340
TRAVIS: Got to feed those forges with something!

631
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:05,569
MARISHA: Okay. I have a Ring of Protection +1 that
no one's been using because it's just a Ring of

632
00:47:05,569 --> 00:47:07,976
Protection +1. Which is good, by the way.

633
00:47:07,976 --> 00:47:09,662
TALIESIN: And I have the Ring of Lightning
Resistance.

634
00:47:09,662 --> 00:47:10,789
LIAM: I have two Vestiges.

635
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:13,140
LAURA: Do you want to try this Greatsword of
Frenzy?

636
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,418
MARISHA: Yeah, let's do the Greatsword.

637
00:47:14,418 --> 00:47:15,523
TRAVIS: What about the Alchemy Jug?

638
00:47:15,523 --> 00:47:16,404
TALIESIN: No!

639
00:47:16,404 --> 00:47:17,136
LIAM: No way!

640
00:47:17,136 --> 00:47:18,564
TRAVIS: Which we have used-- what?

641
00:47:18,564 --> 00:47:22,365
LAURA: Doesn't matter, it's too cool! You make
mayonnaise out of that all the time!

642
00:47:22,365 --> 00:47:25,754
MARISHA: And I have my +1 magic necklace.

643
00:47:25,754 --> 00:47:27,926
TALIESIN: Are you using that?

644
00:47:27,926 --> 00:47:28,870
MARISHA: No.

645
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:29,950
TALIESIN: Okay.

646
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:34,805
MATT: You hear the heavy foot taps of an
impatient--

647
00:47:34,805 --> 00:47:43,269
MARISHA: Okay, all right. Here's what I'm going to
do. I'm going to take the Greatsword and the Ring

648
00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:45,324
of Lightning Resistance and put it on the table.

649
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:48,026
MATT: Can someone run that to me real fast, if you
don't mind?

650
00:47:48,026 --> 00:47:49,460
SAM: Coming!

651
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:52,504
TALIESIN: (hums "Yakety Sax")

652
00:47:52,504 --> 00:47:55,814
MARISHA: I'm glad we didn't sell any of this stuff
over the course of time.

653
00:47:55,814 --> 00:48:02,876
MATT: So you take the big Greatsword and (crash)
put it on there, and take the ring, place it up

654
00:48:02,876 --> 00:48:09,428
there with it. Both of his large, meaty fire giant
hands grasp the side of the table as he leans down

655
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:19,894
and looks them over very intently. Takes the
blade, holds it in his hands. "This is a very good start."

656
00:48:19,894 --> 00:48:29,837
MARISHA: Oh, yeah. Well, lucky you! I also happen
to have this awesome Magic Choker +1.

657
00:48:29,837 --> 00:48:33,500
TRAVIS: Choker? Did you offer the fire giant a
fucking choker?

658
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,071
TALIESIN: He can wear it as a pinkie ring.

659
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:39,333
MARISHA: I also offered him a tiny ring. He's
going to use it.

660
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,470
TALIESIN: It's going to be like a little eyebrow
piercing.

661
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:48,771
MATT: As you place it there, he glances at it for
a second. The little, burning pupils of the giant

662
00:48:48,771 --> 00:48:56,344
look up towards you. "It was a strong start. Not a
very strong follow up." As he leans back up, he says--

663
00:48:56,344 --> 00:49:02,961
MARISHA: Wait! That's a two-for-one deal, because
it also comes with this Ring of Protection. You

664
00:49:02,961 --> 00:49:04,751
just hadn't let me get that far yet.

665
00:49:04,751 --> 00:49:06,202
TRAVIS: Arms, arms!

666
00:49:06,202 --> 00:49:08,964
LAURA: He doesn't want jewelry, he wants arms!

667
00:49:08,964 --> 00:49:13,957
MARISHA: Oh, he wants arms, right. It's a Ring of
Protection. That's cool.

668
00:49:13,957 --> 00:49:16,422
LAURA: Yeah, but it's not weapons.

669
00:49:16,422 --> 00:49:30,901
MATT: He seems unmoved by the presentation of the
ring. He says, "You are to make one more offer. If

670
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:41,845
"you do not, I will tell the Illuminated of the
dubious outsiders masquerading as servants. Slaves

671
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:48,667
"sent to undermine the rule of the The Grand Sultan
of the Efreet, The Lord of the Flame, The

672
00:49:48,667 --> 00:49:55,025
"Potentate Incandescent, The Tempering and Eternal
Flame of Truth, The Most Puissant of Hunters,

673
00:49:55,025 --> 00:50:02,135
"Marshall of the Order of the Fiery Heart, The
Smoldering Dictator, The Crimson Firebrand Marrake

674
00:50:02,135 --> 00:50:05,436
"al-Sidaan al-Hariq ben Lazan."

675
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:06,537
TRAVIS: God bless you.

676
00:50:06,537 --> 00:50:09,376
MATT: "So. What is your final offer?"

677
00:50:09,376 --> 00:50:10,998
MARISHA: Was that <i>one</i> man's resume?

678
00:50:10,998 --> 00:50:13,607
TRAVIS: Vax, give him all of your Vestiges!

679
00:50:13,607 --> 00:50:16,198
(laughter)

680
00:50:16,198 --> 00:50:20,116
MARISHA: What if we give him some of the dragon
scales?

681
00:50:20,116 --> 00:50:22,272
TRAVIS: What about the black sapphire?

682
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:27,230
LAURA: I mean, we do have dragon scales. We do
have a fuck-ton of dragon scales.

683
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,606
SAM: But he wants arms!

684
00:50:28,606 --> 00:50:41,990
MARISHA: Hang on! Whaska! A great craftsman such
as yourself deserves only the finest of materials.

685
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:53,056
How about some (whispers) dragon scales?
Dragonhide? White dragon, what kind of dragonhide?

686
00:50:53,056 --> 00:50:59,699
White dragonhide.

687
00:50:59,699 --> 00:51:07,283
MATT: One large hard raises up, and begins to tug
at the edge of his beard.

688
00:51:07,283 --> 00:51:16,891
MARISHA: A lot of white dragonhide. I think we
even have a fair amount.

689
00:51:16,891 --> 00:51:18,358
TRAVIS: Leave it.

690
00:51:18,358 --> 00:51:19,897
LAURA: Just let it go.

691
00:51:19,897 --> 00:51:24,067
MATT: "Make your offer."

692
00:51:24,067 --> 00:51:25,818
LAURA: Get it out of the bag of holding.

693
00:51:25,818 --> 00:51:27,495
MATT: His finger taps the edge of the table.

694
00:51:27,495 --> 00:51:29,051
SAM: Put it on the table, people.

695
00:51:29,051 --> 00:51:33,067
LAURA: Give him, like, 40 pounds of white
dragonhide.

696
00:51:33,067 --> 00:51:38,149
MARISHA: Yeah, he needs a lot. He's gonna have a big
loincloth. A really big loincloth.

697
00:51:38,149 --> 00:51:40,156
TALIESIN: That's going to be weird.

698
00:51:40,156 --> 00:51:42,147
TRAVIS: 40 pounds of white dragonhide.

699
00:51:42,147 --> 00:51:47,034
LAURA: Right? Can we do it like that?

700
00:51:47,034 --> 00:51:56,778
MATT: Yeah. You go ahead and unveil and put 40
pounds of white dragonhide--

701
00:51:56,778 --> 00:52:09,751
MARISHA: I want to make sure it's like, "One, two,
three, four, five--" Five minutes later, "37--"

702
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:12,462
LAURA: But it's better if it's one big piece, as
opposed to a bunch of tiny little pieces.

703
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:24,766
MATT: You manage to pull all of the hide out. With
flourish. As you finish, Whaska's mouth turns into

704
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:33,773
this wide grin, as his arms go out (thump) scoop
it all to his end of the table. "Your respect will

705
00:52:33,773 --> 00:52:40,094
"be remembered." He takes the handfuls of it, and
the sword, puts the rings into the pouch, takes

706
00:52:40,094 --> 00:52:45,090
the sword and jams it into his belt, takes the
hide, and walks over to the side and opens this

707
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:54,303
large chest. Throws everything into the side of
it. Closes it. And begins to walk over. As he

708
00:52:54,303 --> 00:53:01,233
walks away from it you hear this heavy metal click
when he's about 15, 20 feet from the chest. He

709
00:53:01,233 --> 00:53:08,170
steps to the table. "Now--" He then rests his
elbows on the table, folding his hands under his

710
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:15,334
chin, leaning forward towards you, and looks over
the rest of the troupe. "There are two other fire

711
00:53:15,334 --> 00:53:32,333
"giants here. One is Sugan. Sugan, well, was the
brains behind our positions. I have this foundry

712
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:46,331
"and this forge because Sugan led us against our
people. He currently enslaved most of our kin,

713
00:53:46,331 --> 00:53:58,104
"with my help, and with the help of Juuraiel, and
her late husband, Guras. Sugan, he currently

714
00:53:58,104 --> 00:54:07,487
"resides within the foundry itself, as a respected
chain lord to the rest of his kind. Do not speak

715
00:54:07,487 --> 00:54:21,660
"to Sugan. You seek Juuraiel. Juuraiel runs a
powerful slag mine in the pits. Her home is

716
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:31,015
"outside the Shrine to Surtr, called the Smoking
Hammer Shrine. Look for the spiraling tower of

717
00:54:31,015 --> 00:54:40,195
"black iron and copper. If there is any problems--"
And he reaches back, and pulls forward a small,

718
00:54:40,195 --> 00:54:47,702
square, metal icon. And he flicks it over towards
you. It looks like a small piece of copper in his

719
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:51,606
thumb. But as he flicks it in your direction, you
reach out instinctively to grab it, Keyleth, and

720
00:54:51,606 --> 00:54:56,692
then realize, "Oh, shit!" And you have to back out
of the way as it (loud thud). Roughly the size of

721
00:54:56,692 --> 00:54:58,511
a manhole cover.

722
00:54:58,511 --> 00:54:59,900
MARISHA: It's a ring?

723
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:04,817
MATT: It's a large piece of square metal. You look
at it and it has a series of runes that you

724
00:55:04,817 --> 00:55:20,360
recognize as being Giant imprinted into the metal.
"This will grant you respect and conversation with

725
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:28,118
"Juuraiel. Should she show any resistance, just
tell her I gave it to you."

726
00:55:28,118 --> 00:55:33,683
MARISHA: Thank you. I go over and I start trying
to (grunts) pick it up.

727
00:55:33,683 --> 00:55:34,858
MATT: Make a strength check.

728
00:55:34,858 --> 00:55:40,486
(laughter)

729
00:55:40,486 --> 00:55:42,382
TRAVIS: Use your legs. Bend the knees.

730
00:55:42,382 --> 00:55:43,978
TALIESIN: Oh, no!

731
00:55:43,978 --> 00:55:45,081
LIAM: Pull a hammie?

732
00:55:45,081 --> 00:55:46,288
MARISHA: Eight total.

733
00:55:46,288 --> 00:55:48,361
MATT: You can get it a few inches off the ground--

734
00:55:48,361 --> 00:55:49,624
MARISHA: Or just a check, right? Just a straight
check?

735
00:55:49,624 --> 00:55:50,671
MATT: Yeah, just with your modifier.

736
00:55:50,671 --> 00:55:51,884
MARISHA: Okay, then five.

737
00:55:51,884 --> 00:55:54,942
MATT: You get it a few inches off the ground
before it (crashing sound) hits the ground with a

738
00:55:54,942 --> 00:55:56,085
resounding clang.

739
00:55:56,085 --> 00:55:57,879
MARISHA: (hisses in pain)

740
00:55:57,879 --> 00:55:59,406
MATT: Almost got your finger, but you're fine.

741
00:55:59,406 --> 00:56:00,310
MARISHA: Okay.

742
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:01,462
TRAVIS: Do you want me to?

743
00:56:01,462 --> 00:56:03,168
MARISHA: Yeah.

744
00:56:03,168 --> 00:56:04,666
TRAVIS: C'mon, Beast Mode!

745
00:56:04,666 --> 00:56:07,506
LAURA: You're so strong, Pike.

746
00:56:07,506 --> 00:56:08,920
ASHLEY: I'll give it a try.

747
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:14,800
SAM: C'mon, Pike! Lift that thing!

748
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,815
LAURA: Get it!

749
00:56:16,815 --> 00:56:23,145
ASHLEY: Oh, definitely not. Just doesn't even
move. That's a seven.

750
00:56:23,145 --> 00:56:28,565
MATT: Between the two of you, given about five
minutes, you guys could eventually carry it.

751
00:56:28,565 --> 00:56:36,480
MARISHA: You wouldn't happen to have a wallet
version, would you? Don't worry about it!

752
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,083
TALIESIN: Can we put it in the Bag of Holding?

753
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:43,693
MATT: Grabs the table and moves it back to the
space he got it. (thunderous claps) "Our business

754
00:56:43,693 --> 00:56:57,196
"is done. Good luck. And should you find yourself
in any trouble, you never heard my name." Turns

755
00:56:57,196 --> 00:57:03,526
back to the anvil, slowly puts on the apron, and
goes right back to work. (metal ringing) Holds the

756
00:57:03,526 --> 00:57:08,687
metal over into the large furnace to the side to
let it glow to a brighter orange, to white at the

757
00:57:08,687 --> 00:57:12,657
tip, and begins hammering once more. As you guys
gather the rest of your strength to pull that

758
00:57:12,657 --> 00:57:14,082
along with you.

759
00:57:14,082 --> 00:57:17,198
LAURA: Sexiest fire giant I ever did see.

760
00:57:17,198 --> 00:57:18,798
LIAM: Who was that?

761
00:57:18,798 --> 00:57:23,488
MATT: There is this awkward pause. Whaska stops
and looks over.

762
00:57:23,488 --> 00:57:25,415
(laughter)

763
00:57:25,415 --> 00:57:31,529
TRAVIS: She's touched. Just don't worry about
her.

764
00:57:31,613 --> 00:57:37,586
MARISHA: Oh, Whaska! Is it okay if I ask one last
question?

765
00:57:37,586 --> 00:57:42,076
MATT: "Depends on the question. What do you
ask?"

766
00:57:42,076 --> 00:57:51,979
MARISHA: How do fire giants feel about the
name, the Suutan-- Oh, wait. I already asked him

767
00:57:51,979 --> 00:57:56,175
that. Never mind. You know what, been a huge help.

768
00:57:56,175 --> 00:57:58,272
(laughter)

769
00:57:58,272 --> 00:58:00,582
TRAVIS: You're not going to fist-bump, or
anything?

770
00:58:00,582 --> 00:58:03,252
MATT: (metal ringing) Goes right back to
hammering.

771
00:58:03,252 --> 00:58:05,423
SAM: Have you heard of the Plate of the
Dawnmartyr?

772
00:58:05,423 --> 00:58:12,174
MARISHA: Is it too late to roll an insight check
to make sure he was telling us the whole story?

773
00:58:12,174 --> 00:58:18,699
MATT: You could roll one now to gain his current
composure while he's hammering the large sword.

774
00:58:18,699 --> 00:58:21,214
MARISHA: That's pretty good. 25.

775
00:58:21,214 --> 00:58:25,437
MATT: He seems focused on his work and cares less
about your presence now than he did when you

776
00:58:25,437 --> 00:58:27,162
entered.

777
00:58:27,162 --> 00:58:29,167
TRAVIS: How heavy is that thing?

778
00:58:29,167 --> 00:58:33,496
MARISHA: You know, it's more 
cumbersome? It's awkward.

779
00:58:33,496 --> 00:58:35,359
SAM: Doesn't have handles.

780
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:37,907
MARISHA: It's very wide. I can't really--

781
00:58:37,907 --> 00:58:39,346
SAM: Like picking up a box.

782
00:58:39,346 --> 00:58:42,036
MARISHA: Yes. But it's not that heavy.

783
00:58:42,036 --> 00:58:44,721
TRAVIS: You guys are doing a great job with that,
really.

784
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:45,914
MARISHA: Thank you.

785
00:58:45,914 --> 00:58:47,673
TALIESIN: It's like a piece of pre-packaged Ikea
furniture.

786
00:58:47,673 --> 00:58:48,966
MATT: Yeah.

787
00:58:48,966 --> 00:58:53,496
MARISHA: How is it they didn't design this to fit
into a <i>car.</i>

788
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:57,950
MATT: As Keyleth and Pike carry it along at an
angle because of height difference.

789
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:01,112
ASHLEY: Got to take a second to switch hands.

790
00:59:01,112 --> 00:59:04,249
MATT: Wait, wait, oh oh oh!

791
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,492
MARISHA: You walk backwards.

792
00:59:06,492 --> 00:59:10,641
TALIESIN: We bought the new bed frame. It's called
the "Nupe."

793
00:59:10,641 --> 00:59:12,583
TRAVIS: No you go first, you go first.

794
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:13,882
ASHLEY: I'll go backwards, I'll go backwards.

795
00:59:13,882 --> 00:59:14,895
TRAVIS: Turn it over!

796
00:59:14,895 --> 00:59:16,274
MARISHA: Are you okay going down the stairs? Okay,
okay.

797
00:59:16,274 --> 00:59:17,270
ASHLEY: Okay.

798
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:19,973
(clanging sound effects)

799
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:25,100
LIAM: As we leave, I give the saddest puppy stare
to that wallet on the side of his belt and wish

800
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,274
upon a star. And then I leave.

801
00:59:27,274 --> 00:59:37,504
MATT: All right. You guys make your way out into
the main thoroughfare. Senokir turns back. "Very

802
00:59:37,504 --> 00:59:42,670
"well. I know where this shrine is, so follow me."

803
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:45,340
LAURA: (imitates Senokir) Great. We will.

804
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:46,789
ASHLEY: (imitates Senokir) Great.

805
00:59:46,789 --> 00:59:48,017
TRAVIS: (whispers) Weird.

806
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:49,652
MATT: "Are you mocking me?"

807
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:51,906
LAURA: What? What are you talking about?

808
00:59:51,906 --> 00:59:56,200
MATT: "Right. Continue, please." Pulls the chains
a little bit.

809
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,893
TRAVIS: (choking noise)

810
00:59:57,893 --> 01:00:14,402
MATT: An extended period of time to make it
towards where the mines and the pits are for the

811
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:23,311
next hour or so, walking through the streets. As
you're heading in this northward direction, you

812
01:00:23,311 --> 01:00:30,541
pass by a series of intersections where a lot of
these lava rivers merge and splinter off. You can

813
01:00:30,541 --> 01:00:39,295
see there are individuals that are taking elements
of it and carrying off large metallic buckets. You

814
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:46,199
also notice in the distance one very
terrifying-looking structure. All the rest have

815
01:00:46,199 --> 01:00:52,127
this beautiful, grandiose design to them. There is
one that looks like it is made of curved obsidian

816
01:00:52,127 --> 01:00:59,829
spikes, like a series of giant, clawed hands
climbing up over themselves. It forms a bastion in

817
01:00:59,829 --> 01:01:04,670
the center of the city. This is on the outskirts
of the furnace that you walked past or saw in the

818
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:10,632
distance when you first left Senokir's
establishment. Pressing beyond that, you notice

819
01:01:10,632 --> 01:01:19,708
that there is a heavy number of nasty-looking
devilish entities that seem to be running patrol

820
01:01:19,708 --> 01:01:27,524
around the outside of that building. You get the
essence that there's a heavy devil presence in the

821
01:01:27,524 --> 01:01:34,394
City of Brass. Devils of multiple kinds, you
gather. Many you've never seen before. But they

822
01:01:34,394 --> 01:01:40,901
seem to be gathering around and have that same
terrifying essence to them. You see some that are

823
01:01:40,901 --> 01:01:45,424
humanoid, but covered in long chains with hooks at
the end, dragging on the ground behind them. You

824
01:01:45,424 --> 01:01:52,821
see some that are these nasty little impish
looking creatures that leap from section to

825
01:01:52,821 --> 01:01:58,908
section and usually travel in packs. But they all
have business; they carry small satchels at their

826
01:01:58,908 --> 01:02:04,625
side. They mingle with the rest of the efreet and
the other denizens of the city unmolested,

827
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:06,517
unbothered, unprovoked.

828
01:02:06,517 --> 01:02:09,888
LIAM: I wave at a couple. Quietly.

829
01:02:09,888 --> 01:02:14,701
MATT: From a distance, you're not getting 
too close. No one seems to pay mind.

830
01:02:14,701 --> 01:02:16,869
LAURA: Senokir, what is that place?

831
01:02:16,869 --> 01:02:22,195
MATT: "That is the embassy. We shouldn't go by
there."

832
01:02:22,195 --> 01:02:24,173
TRAVIS: Why? What's in the embassy?

833
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:28,114
MATT: "Well, that's where the ambassadors to the
Nine Hells reside."

834
01:02:28,114 --> 01:02:38,928
TRAVIS: Right. Nine. That's a lot.

835
01:02:38,928 --> 01:02:41,978
MARISHA: Is it like a cityscape?

836
01:02:42,037 --> 01:02:44,828
SAM: We have diplomatic immunity.

837
01:02:44,828 --> 01:02:49,427
TRAVIS: Senokir, did that exchange go about the
way you thought it would?

838
01:02:49,427 --> 01:02:50,700
MATT: "Sure."

839
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,356
(laughter)

840
01:02:53,356 --> 01:02:55,470
TRAVIS: Good.

841
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:56,795
LIAM: This guy likes to party.

842
01:02:56,795 --> 01:03:12,580
MATT: As you continue, eventually you come upon
the outside of this beautiful temple that is made

843
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:22,444
of hundreds of heavy, dark iron and metal hammers
that are all molded together in this mish-mash

844
01:03:22,444 --> 01:03:30,669
that forms this giant archway. As you walk past
it, Senokir pipes up again, "And that is the

845
01:03:30,669 --> 01:03:36,342
"Smoking Hammer Shrine that was spoken of. Which
means--" And he points over to the right. There

846
01:03:36,342 --> 01:03:47,020
you can see-- it resembles a home that is conical in
its advancement. It's thick at the base, and it

847
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:55,548
spirals upward, made of black metallic substance.
Rough around the edges, like it's been pushed

848
01:03:55,548 --> 01:04:00,264
together, similar to the shrine you saw. But it's
this spiral that continues upward. This very thick

849
01:04:00,264 --> 01:04:04,720
spiral that quickly tapers off into a point. You
see there are levels to it, and there appear to be

850
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:09,822
openings and windows. This is an abode of some
kind. A very massive abode, and to a certain

851
01:04:09,822 --> 01:04:12,727
extent one of the more impressive buildings you've
seen in this immediate vicinity.

852
01:04:12,727 --> 01:04:15,258
LAURA: Big enough for a giant to live in?

853
01:04:15,258 --> 01:04:22,808
MATT: Easily. As you get to the front of the
building, there are no windows that lead to the

854
01:04:22,808 --> 01:04:31,578
bottom floor. There is one very heavy door that is
a half-circle. You're not sure how, where, or from

855
01:04:31,578 --> 01:04:37,986
which direction it opens, but it is this big,
round, metal slab that stands there at the front.

856
01:04:37,986 --> 01:04:46,824
You do see a brass knob in the center of it, that
is roughly about eye-height to you, Grog. And

857
01:04:46,824 --> 01:04:57,787
that's the extent of it. As you approach, Senokir
turns around, "So I believe we've found our way to

858
01:04:57,787 --> 01:05:08,683
"the home of Juuraiel, as you acquired the
information about. Your turn."

859
01:05:08,683 --> 01:05:12,222
MARISHA: Yes, we know. Sorry.

860
01:05:12,222 --> 01:05:16,979
MATT: "So? What is your intent here?"

861
01:05:16,979 --> 01:05:25,667
SAM: Well, gang. I don't feel like we should say
the name of the thing that we want, in case she

862
01:05:25,667 --> 01:05:27,555
doesn't know what it is?

863
01:05:27,555 --> 01:05:35,303
LAURA: Maybe describe it? I feel like the more we
make it seem like it's valuable to us, the more

864
01:05:35,303 --> 01:05:39,702
they're going to ask in return. So maybe make it
seem less valuable?

865
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:43,700
LIAM: She won it in a card game and hung it on the
wall as a decoration.

866
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:46,888
LAURA: She could think it's a fucking trinket. It
could be like nothing. It could be like a

867
01:05:46,888 --> 01:05:48,307
candlestick.

868
01:05:48,307 --> 01:05:53,760
TRAVIS: Do I know if giants have any natural
enemies that they hate?

869
01:05:53,760 --> 01:06:03,097
MATT: Other giants. Well, they have, depending on
the type of giant, many natural enemies, usually

870
01:06:03,097 --> 01:06:09,311
that exist within the topography they're used to.
You only really know about stone giants in the

871
01:06:09,311 --> 01:06:16,880
Cliffkeep. And maybe hill giants. There is no
specific, sworn, vengeful enemies to the stone

872
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,243
giants that you're aware of.

873
01:06:18,243 --> 01:06:23,867
TRAVIS: Did he say that Sugan, being the brains of
the two, enslaved other giants?

874
01:06:23,867 --> 01:06:30,790
MATT: You got the essence that there was
a large coup. There was a larger free

875
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:36,306
citizenship of fire giants that existed within the
city. Through some circumstance, these three

876
01:06:36,306 --> 01:06:42,166
currently remaining giants sold the rest of their
kind within the city into slavery or had them

877
01:06:42,166 --> 01:06:49,268
ousted. The three that did so elevated their
social status and became more powerful

878
01:06:49,268 --> 01:06:51,295
figures within the City of Brass.

879
01:06:51,295 --> 01:06:53,983
TRAVIS: I think you might have to play him in a
game of cards.

880
01:06:53,983 --> 01:06:55,218
SAM and MARISHA: Yeah.

881
01:06:55,218 --> 01:06:58,464
SAM: Wait, Keyleth will?

882
01:06:58,464 --> 01:07:00,087
MARISHA: No. I will not.

883
01:07:00,087 --> 01:07:02,306
LAURA: Scanlan will.

884
01:07:02,306 --> 01:07:04,202
MARISHA: That's a Scanlan or a Percy thing.

885
01:07:04,202 --> 01:07:05,420
SAM: Me?!

886
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:08,706
TRAVIS: (singing) You're a hustler, baby!

887
01:07:08,706 --> 01:07:14,409
LIAM: I don't want to do anything. I want you to
win this in a game of cards. But I'll be a plan B.

888
01:07:14,409 --> 01:07:15,808
They're not going to see me.

889
01:07:15,808 --> 01:07:22,118
TALIESIN: If you have the magic still, we could
find out precisely where the armor is.

890
01:07:22,118 --> 01:07:29,558
MARISHA: That's true. That spell lasts for ten
minutes, the Locate Item spell.

891
01:07:29,558 --> 01:07:33,625
LAURA: So I'd have to cast it again. I only have
one more level two spell because I don't have very

892
01:07:33,625 --> 01:07:34,870
many spells.

893
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:37,792
MARISHA: I can cast it, because I shouldn't speak
here.

894
01:07:37,792 --> 01:07:41,083
TRAVIS: You did so good, though.

895
01:07:41,083 --> 01:07:43,019
MARISHA: Thanks!

896
01:07:43,019 --> 01:07:56,558
TRAVIS: Oh, fair fire giant! Fair? Hammering at an
anvil. 20 feet tall. Oh, fair, gentle fire giant!

897
01:07:56,558 --> 01:07:59,075
MARISHA: Oh, giant. My fair giant.

898
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:03,873
TRAVIS: Do we do the spell when we get up there,
or now?

899
01:08:03,873 --> 01:08:07,019
LAURA: Do it now, because it's 1,000 feet.

900
01:08:07,019 --> 01:08:10,057
MARISHA: I'll cast Locate Item.

901
01:08:10,057 --> 01:08:13,980
MATT: All right. As you go and pull up your
component, you snap a twig.

902
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:16,466
MARISHA: No one's around and going to maim me,
right?

903
01:08:16,466 --> 01:08:23,301
MATT: You take a moment to wait until there's no
immediate approaching individuals that might see

904
01:08:23,301 --> 01:08:32,849
it. As far as spells go, it still requires a lot
of physical action, but you can keep it condensed.

905
01:08:32,849 --> 01:08:38,532
As soon as you finish, you feel the immediate
glowing beacon of your intent within that

906
01:08:38,532 --> 01:08:39,881
structure.

907
01:08:39,881 --> 01:08:41,043
MARISHA: It's here.

908
01:08:41,043 --> 01:08:44,272
TALIESIN: Is it on the ground floor? Or does it
feel like it's above us?

909
01:08:44,272 --> 01:08:54,519
MATT: It appears to be maybe 25 feet up from where
you currently are at an angle, on the inside of

910
01:08:54,519 --> 01:08:55,754
the building.

911
01:08:55,754 --> 01:08:58,256
MARISHA: It's going to be right on the inside,
hanging on the wall.

912
01:08:58,256 --> 01:09:02,498
TRAVIS: Can't Vax do some Spider-Man shit and
check out the windows? He's all invisible.

913
01:09:02,498 --> 01:09:05,717
SAM: It's risky.

914
01:09:05,717 --> 01:09:09,311
TRAVIS: Why? If he falls, nobody will see it.
We'll just hear it.

915
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:12,227
LIAM: Yeah! And then you pretend like you
tripped!

916
01:09:12,227 --> 01:09:15,921
MARISHA: Are there really high windows?

917
01:09:15,921 --> 01:09:23,508
MATT: There are no windows on the bottom floor. On
the second floor up, there are, yes. Which is

918
01:09:23,508 --> 01:09:25,901
about 40 feet up.

919
01:09:25,901 --> 01:09:28,329
LAURA: No, it's definitely on the first floor.

920
01:09:28,329 --> 01:09:30,963
MARISHA: They're 20 feet high, so, high up.

921
01:09:30,963 --> 01:09:34,667
LAURA: That's what it is. It's on the first floor,
up high.

922
01:09:34,667 --> 01:09:36,158
LIAM: So let me go.

923
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:38,276
SAM: Yeah, dude! This is what you do!

924
01:09:38,276 --> 01:09:40,931
LAURA: He just said there were windows on the
second floor.

925
01:09:40,931 --> 01:09:45,997
LIAM: I'm already climbing. Would this be
acrobatics?

926
01:09:45,997 --> 01:09:47,953
MATT: For climbing, this would be athletics.

927
01:09:47,953 --> 01:09:54,470
LIAM: Athletics. Dang it, Bobby. That's a 16.

928
01:09:54,470 --> 01:10:05,267
MATT: Dang it, Bobby! All right. Thanks to the
rough construction of this building, it isn't too

929
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:08,626
difficult to find handholds, though there are
certain moments where you have to leap and catch

930
01:10:08,626 --> 01:10:16,557
to get there. It takes you probably the better
part of 15 minutes to eventually get up to that

931
01:10:16,557 --> 01:10:23,795
area. The first opening you see, even though it's
a window, is an oval porthole in the side of that

932
01:10:23,795 --> 01:10:34,955
structure. As you glance inside, getting your arm
up in there, you are inside a servants' quarters,

933
01:10:34,955 --> 01:10:41,502
but even the servants' quarters are very large.
It's simple. You see two beds in there, but the

934
01:10:41,502 --> 01:10:50,790
beds are 30 feet long, 20 feet wide with various
hides and furs that have been patched together in

935
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:58,999
this quilt-like fashion, but haphazard in their
stitching. Other than that, it's not very pretty.

936
01:10:58,999 --> 01:11:04,556
LIAM: I think there might be a lot of giants
potentially in here at any one time.

937
01:11:04,556 --> 01:11:08,387
MATT: You see two very large metallic pissing pots
that currently reside at the edge of each bed.

938
01:11:08,387 --> 01:11:11,433
LAURA: Eww, you could take a swim in it!

939
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:13,701
(disgusted noises)

940
01:11:13,701 --> 01:11:16,598
MATT: Were you so inclined, you definitely could.

941
01:11:16,598 --> 01:11:21,583
LIAM: But nobody in here now?

942
01:11:21,583 --> 01:11:23,185
MATT: Nobody in here now, no.

943
01:11:23,185 --> 01:11:28,843
LIAM: Are there any other windows along from where
I am? I know they would be a ways off.

944
01:11:28,843 --> 01:11:34,630
MATT: It's a ways off to the next one, but you could
try to climb over if you'd like to.

945
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:36,258
LIAM: Yeah.

946
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:40,883
MATT: I need you to make another athletics check
for me.

947
01:11:40,883 --> 01:11:44,166
LIAM: That's a 19.

948
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:53,010
MATT: You slowly shimmy over. While the rest of
you guys are waiting, as you're sitting there, you

949
01:11:53,010 --> 01:12:00,808
can't see what's happening; you occasionally see a
pebble (thunk) and a bit of dust fall. Senokir's

950
01:12:00,808 --> 01:12:10,697
like, "Well, how about we walk around for a moment,
so we aren't looking weirdly in public doing

951
01:12:10,697 --> 01:12:11,662
"nothing."

952
01:12:11,662 --> 01:12:16,369
SAM: You're right. If you think we're looking
weird, we should trust that.

953
01:12:16,369 --> 01:12:27,905
MATT: "Well said." Tugs the chain, and you guys
begin to be dragged in a heavy circle around the

954
01:12:27,905 --> 01:12:29,356
nearby street.

955
01:12:29,356 --> 01:12:33,666
MARISHA: I radio over the earpiece to Vax and say,
hey, we're going to walk the block.

956
01:12:33,666 --> 01:12:36,139
LIAM: Yeah cool, I'm just hanging.

957
01:12:36,139 --> 01:12:43,760
MATT: All right. You leap over, grasping, lose
your hand for a second, and get back up there. The

958
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,500
soreness is starting to kick in; you're not used
to this much physical activity of this type of

959
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,278
strength, and it's kicking your ass.

960
01:12:48,278 --> 01:12:51,523
LIAM: So fast, but so weak.

961
01:12:51,523 --> 01:12:58,930
MATT: So fast, but so weak. It's already hot here,
and the beads of sweat are pouring down your face at

962
01:12:58,930 --> 01:13:00,201
this point.

963
01:13:00,201 --> 01:13:03,799
LIAM: I have little indoor fans, like I'm a
baseball mascot.

964
01:13:03,799 --> 01:13:07,927
MATT: Yeah, basically. Thankfully you have fire
resistance so you don't have to worry about the

965
01:13:07,927 --> 01:13:12,219
heat getting too much on you. It's more of the
physical exertion that's getting you. You do

966
01:13:12,219 --> 01:13:17,746
eventually pull over to the next window. As you
get to it, you pull up into the lip, and as you

967
01:13:17,746 --> 01:13:23,985
reach out to grab, your hand hits something. You
look up, and you see that this particular opening

968
01:13:23,985 --> 01:13:33,242
has an imperfect, thick glass window or at least a
glass surface that is currently blocking the

969
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,913
entrance. This is actually a window that is
closed.

970
01:13:35,913 --> 01:13:37,004
LIAM: Is it transparent?

971
01:13:37,004 --> 01:13:38,727
MATT: Somewhat transparent, yes.

972
01:13:38,727 --> 01:13:41,945
LIAM: So it's just cloudy?

973
01:13:41,945 --> 01:13:48,389
MATT: It's somewhat opaque, because of the nature
of its creation it wasn't perfect glass. It's

974
01:13:48,389 --> 01:13:54,966
about that thick, and the entire oval is about six
feet high, and about four feet wide.

975
01:13:54,966 --> 01:13:57,767
LIAM: Can I check for traps?

976
01:13:57,767 --> 01:14:00,007
MATT: Sure, go for it. Make an investigation
check.

977
01:14:00,007 --> 01:14:04,406
LIAM: Okay, oh good, 27.

978
01:14:04,406 --> 01:14:17,919
MATT: All right. This window is trapped. As you
glance around, you can see that it is. It is a

979
01:14:17,919 --> 01:14:23,616
window that has a slot on the side. The glass is
wider than the window in a slot that's pulled up

980
01:14:23,616 --> 01:14:27,275
through chains that you gather would probably lift
it from the inside, like a winch that would pull

981
01:14:27,275 --> 01:14:36,037
it open or closed. However, on the bottom, you can
see along the edge. On the very bottom edge, you

982
01:14:36,037 --> 01:14:42,285
can see some sort of slight bit of material that
doesn't match both the glass or the blackened iron

983
01:14:42,285 --> 01:14:48,447
structure of this building. It's a silver plate
that rests where the glass sits down. As soon as

984
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:51,312
it would move, a weight would shift, and something
would happen.

985
01:14:51,312 --> 01:14:57,386
LIAM: Looking at it, do I think I could disarm it
from this side? Or is it something from the inside

986
01:14:57,386 --> 01:14:58,434
of the room?

987
01:14:58,434 --> 01:15:03,467
MATT: It would need to be something from the
inside. Even if you were to attempt to do it from

988
01:15:03,467 --> 01:15:06,778
the inside, you would have to be at the base of
the structure. From this side, it's too big for

989
01:15:06,778 --> 01:15:08,694
you to do anything, really.

990
01:15:08,694 --> 01:15:10,295
LIAM: Okay, and I can't see shit.

991
01:15:10,295 --> 01:15:12,212
MATT: Make a perception check.

992
01:15:12,212 --> 01:15:13,738
LIAM: Natural 20.

993
01:15:13,738 --> 01:15:16,539
MATT: Which gives you a total of?

994
01:15:16,539 --> 01:15:21,299
LIAM: Oh, perception? A total of 32.

995
01:15:21,299 --> 01:15:26,619
MATT: All right. As you peer in and close your eye
on the inside, you can see another bedroom similar

996
01:15:26,619 --> 01:15:31,632
to the one over there that you just passed by. But
this one is exorbitant in its decor. You see

997
01:15:31,632 --> 01:15:39,744
beautiful deep red tapestries along each wall that
are the full length of it. The bed itself is a

998
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:45,703
canopy bed that is 40 feet tall with heavy dark
silks and fabrics that dangle from it. This is a

999
01:15:45,703 --> 01:15:51,207
gaudy bedroom for some sort of a giant.

1000
01:15:51,207 --> 01:15:53,612
LIAM: Any armor on the walls?

1001
01:15:53,612 --> 01:15:59,267
MATT: No armor visible from this perspective, no.
You do see small pieces of art. There are other

1002
01:15:59,267 --> 01:16:07,392
metallic trinkets that are built into the wall.
But nothing that resembles armor, unfortunately.

1003
01:16:07,392 --> 01:16:13,158
LIAM: Well, my arms are starting to do this thing
so I'm going to start going down.

1004
01:16:13,158 --> 01:16:15,800
TALIESIN: There's a giant velvet Elvis.

1005
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:24,888
MATT: You eventually make your way down and wait
for the rest of your group to return. You guys had

1006
01:16:24,888 --> 01:16:31,684
a nice awkward walk being led quietly through the
street and back around.

1007
01:16:31,684 --> 01:16:34,103
TRAVIS: Can we be the monks from Monty Python?

1008
01:16:34,103 --> 01:16:38,905
TALIESIN: Pie Iesu Domine. Dona Eis Requiem.

1009
01:16:38,905 --> 01:16:48,642
MATT: As you guys begin chanting to yourselves,
Senokir goes, "Actually... sure, go ahead," and

1010
01:16:48,642 --> 01:16:55,526
keeps pulling you along as you guys chant in
whatever phrases you decide upon. You come back

1011
01:16:55,526 --> 01:17:01,119
around and you see the rest of them arriving at
the door, although they cannot see you. Senokir

1012
01:17:01,119 --> 01:17:06,793
does glance over in your direction. "Ah, it appears
that our walk was just enough time."

1013
01:17:06,793 --> 01:17:09,626
LAURA: Oh shit, you can see him?

1014
01:17:09,626 --> 01:17:12,089
MATT: "I have my ways, yes."

1015
01:17:12,089 --> 01:17:17,093
ASHLEY: What kind of ways?

1016
01:17:17,093 --> 01:17:24,820
MATT: "Your brother is a fun character."

1017
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:26,885
LAURA: You mean a dick?

1018
01:17:26,885 --> 01:17:36,196
MATT: "From your standards, yes. Being from where
I'm standing, I find it hilarious." (clipped laughter)

1019
01:17:36,196 --> 01:17:38,589
TRAVIS: Oh god, his laugh's the worst.

1020
01:17:38,589 --> 01:17:41,746
MATT: "Now shall we?"

1021
01:17:41,746 --> 01:17:43,777
ASHLEY: Let's?

1022
01:17:43,777 --> 01:17:49,941
SAM: We don't even know how this door works. What
if it's like a DeLorean and flips up or something?

1023
01:17:49,941 --> 01:17:51,744
LAURA: Do you know how to open this door?

1024
01:17:51,744 --> 01:17:53,085
ASHLEY: Do we just knock?

1025
01:17:53,085 --> 01:18:00,520
MATT: "Well, let's try. I have not been here."
Just knocks on it. It barely makes a noise.

1026
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:03,172
TRAVIS: Sounds like bubbles popping.

1027
01:18:03,172 --> 01:18:12,401
MATT: It's like the knuckle against the stonework;
it's making this dull, awful sound. Nothing.

1028
01:18:12,401 --> 01:18:17,609
TRAVIS: Should I knock? Do you want me to <i>knock</i>,
or do you just want me to knock?

1029
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:19,559
SAM, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: <i>Knock.</i>

1030
01:18:19,559 --> 01:18:21,453
TRAVIS: Which one was that, I don't know.

1031
01:18:21,453 --> 01:18:23,464
(laughter)

1032
01:18:23,464 --> 01:18:24,593
SAM: The big one.

1033
01:18:24,593 --> 01:18:33,400
TRAVIS: Okay. Can I lean back and slug the door
using siege?

1034
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:49,495
MATT: Yes, you can. Go ahead and roll an attack.
No weapon bonus though, just your strength.

1035
01:18:49,495 --> 01:18:53,134
TRAVIS: Yeah, so that's a 15.

1036
01:18:53,134 --> 01:18:56,496
MATT: Okay. So that's your strength bonus and your
proficiency modifier?

1037
01:18:56,496 --> 01:18:58,070
TRAVIS: Not my proficiency modifier.

1038
01:18:58,070 --> 01:19:05,667
MATT: So that would be 20. You reach back (heavy
impact) and you watch as his hand hits the section

1039
01:19:05,667 --> 01:19:13,431
where the engraved metal door is, dents inward,
and leaves this big heavy dent in the front and

1040
01:19:13,431 --> 01:19:21,376
the impact is like a dull thunderous clap of
lightning. You hear it echo on the inside.

1041
01:19:21,376 --> 01:19:23,960
ASHLEY: It's engraved with something?

1042
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:30,788
MATT: There was some very faint texture or pattern
to it. Yeah, a design that was built into it.

1043
01:19:30,788 --> 01:19:36,920
TRAVIS: Knuckles. By the way, can I see that
manhole cover you guys have been carrying around

1044
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,111
this whole time?

1045
01:19:38,111 --> 01:19:39,465
MARISHA: Yeah, sure.

1046
01:19:39,465 --> 01:19:43,539
TRAVIS: It's got Giant runes on it. Runes of
Giant.

1047
01:19:43,539 --> 01:19:45,929
MARISHA: Help me. Hey, Pike, can you help prop it
up on that side?

1048
01:19:45,929 --> 01:19:48,902
TRAVIS: Do I recognize any of these runes?

1049
01:19:48,902 --> 01:19:51,390
MATT: You recognize it's Giant. You cannot read.

1050
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:59,976
TRAVIS: Yep. This is very important script. It
says that you must carry this at all times, and if

1051
01:19:59,976 --> 01:20:02,416
you let it go prematurely you will die.

1052
01:20:02,416 --> 01:20:03,705
MARISHA: What?

1053
01:20:03,705 --> 01:20:05,174
ASHLEY: I don't think he's telling the truth.

1054
01:20:05,174 --> 01:20:08,039
TALIESIN: Better safe than sorry, though.

1055
01:20:08,039 --> 01:20:09,680
MATT: Grog, make a deception check.

1056
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:13,128
ASHLEY: We'll hold it.

1057
01:20:13,128 --> 01:20:15,558
TRAVIS: Natural 20!

1058
01:20:15,558 --> 01:20:21,100
MARISHA: What! Bullshit! Goddamn it.

1059
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:24,134
MATT: Which is a grand total of?

1060
01:20:24,134 --> 01:20:26,952
TRAVIS: It's a grand total of 21.

1061
01:20:26,952 --> 01:20:33,289
MATT: Keyleth, Pike, I need you guys to both roll
insight checks.

1062
01:20:33,289 --> 01:20:37,667
TALIESIN: This is the first time that actual
Travis has really leaked into Grog.

1063
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:39,369
LAURA: Yeah, no shit.

1064
01:20:39,369 --> 01:20:41,894
MARISHA: Natural one!

1065
01:20:41,894 --> 01:20:43,797
TALIESIN: Wow.

1066
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:46,825
TRAVIS: The stars are aligning.

1067
01:20:46,825 --> 01:20:54,068
ASHLEY: That's a 14.

1068
01:20:54,068 --> 01:21:00,761
MATT: Okay. Suddenly, as Grog says this, you
realize, him being of giant kin and the

1069
01:21:00,761 --> 01:21:06,762
seriousness in his eyes, and the stark intensity
in the way he describes this: If you drop this,

1070
01:21:06,762 --> 01:21:09,467
something terrible is going to happen!

1071
01:21:09,467 --> 01:21:14,907
MARISHA: Pike, I need to readjust my grip! Here, I
want to put it on my back.

1072
01:21:14,907 --> 01:21:17,041
ASHLEY: Grog, maybe you should hold it then
because we're not as strong as you.

1073
01:21:17,041 --> 01:21:20,115
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't want to drop it. Will it
kill all of us? Is it a blast radius thing?

1074
01:21:20,115 --> 01:21:27,958
TRAVIS: The fable goes on to say that if you hand
it to one of your friends, you will shit

1075
01:21:27,958 --> 01:21:35,661
everywhere. Immediate bowel loss. Green apple
splatters all over your feet, just awful.

1076
01:21:35,702 --> 01:21:40,282
ASHLEY: That doesn't sound true.

1077
01:21:40,282 --> 01:21:43,584
TRAVIS: The giant tales are to be respected.

1078
01:21:43,584 --> 01:21:48,105
MATT: You probably don't believe the second half, 
but you do believe the first half.

1079
01:21:48,105 --> 01:21:49,864
TRAVIS: It is a fable.

1080
01:21:49,864 --> 01:21:52,744
SAM: So it could be metaphor.

1081
01:21:52,744 --> 01:21:56,432
ASHLEY: Safe than sorry, we'll just hold
it.

1082
01:21:56,432 --> 01:22:05,038
MATT: It's at this point you hear this (thunk) and
you hear this heavy, low (clicking) as the sound of

1083
01:22:05,038 --> 01:22:12,331
chains being tightened and winding forward are
followed by the large doorway rising up.

1084
01:22:12,331 --> 01:22:13,737
LAURA: Oh, it lifts!

1085
01:22:13,737 --> 01:22:15,375
LIAM: Does it get stuck with the dent?

1086
01:22:15,375 --> 01:22:23,012
MATT: You watch as it rises, and there is
a small carved slit where the knob itself rises up

1087
01:22:23,074 --> 01:22:31,705
and fits as the door entirely lifts into the
structure leaving the front walkway open and there

1088
01:22:31,705 --> 01:22:38,643
standing, you see with arms off to the side
apparently finishing the rotation of this chain--

1089
01:22:38,643 --> 01:22:40,927
SAM: A wench.

1090
01:22:40,927 --> 01:22:50,821
MATT: No, you see two male fire giants, fully
armored with large blocky black metal swords

1091
01:22:50,821 --> 01:22:53,377
staring down at you from each side.

1092
01:22:53,377 --> 01:22:54,703
MARISHA: What are they wearing?

1093
01:22:54,703 --> 01:23:04,835
MATT: They are both wearing dark plated scale
mail, and both of them have

1094
01:23:04,835 --> 01:23:13,851
these black bands of metal across their neck that
have a small, pulsing red gem in the center.

1095
01:23:13,851 --> 01:23:18,703
SAM: But Matthew, are they fuckable, though? 
Those guards? Would you do them?

1096
01:23:18,703 --> 01:23:33,566
MATT: Scanlan, that's up to you, man. 
You've done some freaky shit in

1097
01:23:33,566 --> 01:23:37,479
your time. Although in this circumstance you'd be
the gerbil.

1098
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:47,150
SAM: I'm the gerbil.

1099
01:23:47,150 --> 01:23:49,624
MARISHA: Lemmiwinks!

1100
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:55,882
MATT: You are Lemmiwinks in this. If you want to
gain some experience, that's up to you.

1101
01:23:55,882 --> 01:23:57,352
TALIESIN: And really interesting fanart.

1102
01:23:57,352 --> 01:24:09,616
MATT: Anyway. They both stand there expectantly,
saying nothing.

1103
01:24:09,616 --> 01:24:15,341
TRAVIS: Is this where we let the master do the
talking?

1104
01:24:15,341 --> 01:24:18,078
MARISHA: We're here to speak with Juuraiel.

1105
01:24:18,078 --> 01:24:26,652
MATT: There's a small pause. You hear a voice echo
from further back in the room, though you see no

1106
01:24:26,652 --> 01:24:32,239
source for it, "What is your business with this
Juuraiel?"

1107
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:47,981
MARISA: We have a deal we'd like to make. We have
a token of our-- We want to play cards?

1108
01:24:47,981 --> 01:24:50,988
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1109
01:24:50,988 --> 01:24:52,413
MARISHA: Oh Jesus.

1110
01:24:52,413 --> 01:24:55,505
TRAVIS: Why are you talking? Persuasion check?

1111
01:24:55,505 --> 01:24:59,419
MARISHA: I'm the only one not in chains! I'm the
only one who can! It's bullshit!

1112
01:24:59,419 --> 01:25:03,796
LAURA: You could have made any of us look like
not--

1113
01:25:03,796 --> 01:25:09,761
MARISHA: No, I can't. It's only a self spell or
else I would've. Oh, that's not too bad.

1114
01:25:09,761 --> 01:25:12,914
Persuasion? 18.

1115
01:25:12,914 --> 01:25:24,118
MATT: There's a pause and you hear a few heavy
footfalls, getting louder as they go. Emerging

1116
01:25:24,118 --> 01:25:33,119
from around the side, you see now a tall,
broad-shouldered, female fire giant with a very

1117
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:41,705
strong square jaw. Her hair is pulled into this
long red braid that dangles past her lower back

1118
01:25:41,705 --> 01:25:47,349
and you can see it drifting behind her with this
large metal ring that it's braided into at the

1119
01:25:47,349 --> 01:25:53,872
bottom. She's not wearing any armor at the moment,
just wearing casual clothes, and these clothes are

1120
01:25:53,872 --> 01:26:02,488
lined with gold and platinum. This is a very
expensive ware that she has on, as well as rings

1121
01:26:02,488 --> 01:26:12,285
that encrust both of her hands. As she steps
forward and looks out towards you. "So you want to

1122
01:26:12,285 --> 01:26:14,753
"play cards and make a deal you say?"

1123
01:26:14,753 --> 01:26:20,711
MARISHA: I lift with Pike the big manhole cover.

1124
01:26:20,711 --> 01:26:24,148
MATT: She reaches over and grabs it, from both of
you.

1125
01:26:24,148 --> 01:26:28,169
TRAVIS: The fables were a lie!

1126
01:26:28,169 --> 01:26:30,937
ASHLEY: We're safe.

1127
01:26:30,937 --> 01:26:44,997
MATT: She glances over it, and puts it over in her
hands. "So, you have spoken with Whaska?"

1128
01:26:44,997 --> 01:26:51,355
MARISHA: Yes.

1129
01:26:51,355 --> 01:27:01,446
MATT: "Okay, I will hear what you have to say.
Let's hear your deal. Let them in!" She turns

1130
01:27:01,446 --> 01:27:06,251
around and walks across to the end of the room, as
the two giants step to the side, removing their

1131
01:27:06,251 --> 01:27:11,996
crossed swords from the entryway that scrape
across the stone. And you may enter the premises.

1132
01:27:11,996 --> 01:27:16,243
LAURA: I want to look around immediately, all the
walls.

1133
01:27:16,243 --> 01:27:19,612
MATT: Make a perception check.

1134
01:27:19,612 --> 01:27:24,473
LIAM: 25.

1135
01:27:24,473 --> 01:27:26,200
LAURA: 29.

1136
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:40,166
MATT: As you guys walk in this central chamber, the
foyer, if you will, it's beautiful. The use of

1137
01:27:40,166 --> 01:27:46,535
autumn colors mixed with various golds and
metallics to create this archway that is a band of

1138
01:27:46,535 --> 01:27:52,407
brass, a band of gold, a band of platinum, a band
of brass, and repeats itself onward. It has this

1139
01:27:52,407 --> 01:28:01,560
tunnel-like feel, and within each of these walls,
there are a number of weapons. Large, giant-sized

1140
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:08,406
weapons that are bolted into the wall and have
beautiful runes inscribed within, and wooden

1141
01:28:08,406 --> 01:28:16,185
plaques on the bottom that contain language that
only you recognize, but can't read. There are

1142
01:28:16,185 --> 01:28:21,860
shelves that contain large books that are locked
up behind glass and chains roped across it. This

1143
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:33,434
is a collection. This is like a small personal
museum. To your size, it is huge. To Juuraiel's

1144
01:28:33,434 --> 01:28:37,467
size, it's like a nice den.

1145
01:28:37,467 --> 01:28:42,142
LIAM: Are there any pieces of armor with a sun on
it?

1146
01:28:42,142 --> 01:28:47,147
MATT: As you guys continue inward, there is a
large desk on the opposite side, as well as a few

1147
01:28:47,147 --> 01:28:52,730
comfortable chairs off to the sides and a
staircase that spirals upward to a second floor.

1148
01:28:52,730 --> 01:29:02,961
There are very bright red burning torches that the
flame itself would be a heavy bonfire by

1149
01:29:02,961 --> 01:29:08,366
comparison to any of you. It burns and licks the
edge of the interior without any damage done to

1150
01:29:08,366 --> 01:29:15,604
the beautiful construct of the foyer. This desk at
the end, which she has now walked around and sat

1151
01:29:15,604 --> 01:29:24,832
on the opposite side, is made up of beautiful dark
green wood and has gold leaf designs all throughout

1152
01:29:24,832 --> 01:29:34,289
the legs. Everything here speaks of projected
affluence. Juuraiel, this fire giant you have come

1153
01:29:34,289 --> 01:29:42,508
across, makes a statement with her wealth, with
everything she presents. The other two giants that

1154
01:29:42,508 --> 01:29:50,525
you saw at the entryway, who had the binding on
their necks, close the door behind them, place

1155
01:29:50,525 --> 01:29:55,990
their weapons up leaning against the wall, and
both lumber behind you as you walk in, slowly

1156
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:58,191
keeping watch as you progress inward.

1157
01:29:58,191 --> 01:30:05,977
Juuraiel raises her finger and says, "Could
you please bring a means of my guests to speak eye

1158
01:30:05,977 --> 01:30:14,494
"to eye?" And the two giants diverge slightly, both
grab two of the chairs and scoot them in, up to

1159
01:30:14,494 --> 01:30:20,693
the edge of the desk. These chairs are about head
height to both of you at the resting point, so

1160
01:30:20,693 --> 01:30:24,965
you'll have to climb up into them, and then
probably get to be up at the desk level.

1161
01:30:24,965 --> 01:30:29,164
LIAM: The cards are going to be like giant novelty
cards.

1162
01:30:29,164 --> 01:30:39,780
TRAVIS: Can I ask a question? In my bag, I have
two vials of fox's cunning. Is that a potion?

1163
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:41,239
MATT: Yeah.

1164
01:30:41,239 --> 01:30:44,568
TRAVIS: Can I drink one?

1165
01:30:44,568 --> 01:30:46,161
MATT: If you'd like to.

1166
01:30:46,161 --> 01:30:57,719
TRAVIS: It's so hot outside! I'm so thirsty! I
would like just a sip. I had it made because I'm

1167
01:30:57,719 --> 01:31:09,129
an idiot. Just in case the sewer plate says "eat
these and enjoy" or something.

1168
01:31:09,129 --> 01:31:18,105
LAURA: Yeah. She already took it, though. I'm
looking at the walls at around 20 to 25 feet. Do I

1169
01:31:18,105 --> 01:31:20,945
see it, up high on the ceiling? Because I've been
looking.

1170
01:31:20,945 --> 01:31:28,938
MATT: As you guys get to the desk itself, on the
back wall behind the desk, above her shoulder, you

1171
01:31:28,938 --> 01:31:36,766
see a beautiful ruby shield that refracts the
light in the room. It's roughly, from head to toe,

1172
01:31:36,766 --> 01:31:42,441
Grog's size. It's pointed at the bottom and rises
up almost like it's designed to look like a flame.

1173
01:31:42,441 --> 01:31:49,074
It has this uneven, flickering, frozen in time of
the construct of the top of the shield. On the

1174
01:31:49,074 --> 01:31:59,352
other side of her other shoulder, you see, much
smaller in size, but a beautiful set of-- make

1175
01:31:59,352 --> 01:32:04,700
sure I get the description right on this--
beautiful brass armor with priceless cut rubies

1176
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:08,257
all across the rest of the silver inlay of the
armor itself.

1177
01:32:08,257 --> 01:32:13,413
LAURA: You're going to be blinging out; we got to
get it!

1178
01:32:13,413 --> 01:32:18,866
LIAM: How many feet up the wall?

1179
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:27,527
MATT: It is about 25 to 30 feet up the wall. It's
up where it's resting about the top height of the

1180
01:32:27,527 --> 01:32:30,472
shield, so there's an even point and it's about
five feet down from the ceiling.

1181
01:32:30,472 --> 01:32:37,027
LAURA: Should we let just Keyleth and Senokir up
on the chairs?

1182
01:32:37,027 --> 01:32:39,950
SAM: I would like a seat at the table, if that's
all right?

1183
01:32:39,950 --> 01:32:54,628
MARISHA: Let me get us out of this. Juuraiel? Do
you mind if we speak candidly and dispose of our

1184
01:32:54,628 --> 01:32:57,585
guises that led us here?

1185
01:32:57,585 --> 01:33:05,868
MATT: "But of course. You've already presented
trust from one of my allies. You are safe within here."

1186
01:33:05,868 --> 01:33:08,440
LAURA: Can I roll an insight check on the whole
allies thing?

1187
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:10,190
MATT: You may.

1188
01:33:10,190 --> 01:33:17,019
LAURA: I was having difficulty choosing. 19?

1189
01:33:17,019 --> 01:33:25,389
TRAVIS: I told you the fables were true!

1190
01:33:25,389 --> 01:33:34,180
SAM: Oh yeah, you know, like Loot Crate and stuff.

1191
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:39,475
TALIESIN: Loot Crate. Magical Loot Crate.

1192
01:33:39,475 --> 01:33:48,557
SAM: Doctor Strange. Use 'criticalrole' for 10% off
your Loot Crate guys, code 'criticalrole'!

1193
01:33:48,557 --> 01:33:53,803
MATT: You drank the potion, Grog?

1194
01:33:53,901 --> 01:33:54,857
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1195
01:33:54,857 --> 01:33:58,197
MATT: So you have advantage on intelligence
checks.

1196
01:33:58,197 --> 01:34:01,454
TRAVIS: Nice. Do I gain any temporary
intelligence?

1197
01:34:01,454 --> 01:34:07,447
MATT: There's a clarity in your mind that hasn't
been there in a while, not since being an eagle.

1198
01:34:07,447 --> 01:34:13,463
TRAVIS: Do I look over at the symbols and do they
all of a sudden start to mean something?

1199
01:34:13,463 --> 01:34:15,579
MATT: No?

1200
01:34:15,579 --> 01:34:18,421
LAURA: Oh no, you can't read still.

1201
01:34:18,421 --> 01:34:21,179
MATT: You need to learn to read still.

1202
01:34:21,179 --> 01:34:26,016
TALIESIN: You have a deeper understanding of the
tragedy of that.

1203
01:34:26,016 --> 01:34:30,201
TRAVIS: I got to A, B, C. We'll work on it.

1204
01:34:30,201 --> 01:34:34,350
LIAM: While you don't recognize them as
letters, they're like little characters that

1205
01:34:34,350 --> 01:34:39,151
you're familiar with: the burly guy, and then the
cross guy, he's holding swords.

1206
01:34:39,151 --> 01:34:41,518
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's the tree. Yep, that one's the
wiener.

1207
01:34:41,518 --> 01:34:44,618
SAM: Keyleth, may I speak?

1208
01:34:44,618 --> 01:34:53,318
MARISHA: I said we'd dropped our guises so yes,
everyone, you can take your slave robes off now.

1209
01:34:53,318 --> 01:34:54,960
SAM: We're all chained.

1210
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:59,754
TRAVIS: Not wearing robes.

1211
01:34:59,754 --> 01:35:03,525
MATT: You see Senokir looks over at Uten.

1212
01:35:03,525 --> 01:35:05,159
MARISHA: Senokir, can we--?

1213
01:35:05,159 --> 01:35:11,096
MATT: "Not to worry. Uten, if you don't mind."
Uten pulls out the ring of keys that he has and

1214
01:35:11,096 --> 01:35:18,071
goes through and begins undoing your guys'
shackles. This will take a little while.

1215
01:35:18,071 --> 01:35:21,759
TRAVIS: Did the door to the room close?

1216
01:35:21,759 --> 01:35:30,979
MATT: It's closed. The two servant giants closed
it. Juuraiel leans forward with a grin, "So,

1217
01:35:30,979 --> 01:35:34,603
"please. What do you come here requesting?"

1218
01:35:34,603 --> 01:35:38,765
SAM: Hello. Hi, there. Hi.

1219
01:35:38,765 --> 01:35:45,501
MATT: "Even smaller!" And now leans in real close
to the edge of the desk. The massive size of her

1220
01:35:45,501 --> 01:35:55,880
face and the breath; it's delightful. It's a
combination of rotting vegetation and very dry

1221
01:35:55,880 --> 01:36:06,330
earth. But her teeth are gleaming. The smile is
interested in whatever you're about to say.

1222
01:36:06,330 --> 01:36:19,918
SAM: Hi there. I'm a bit of a gambler. I'm known
around the worlds as being one of the luckiest men

1223
01:36:19,918 --> 01:36:28,947
with a deck of cards you've ever met. I've won
games in many of the different planes. I see that

1224
01:36:28,947 --> 01:36:32,365
you collect many treasures that you've won in
matches as well. Is that true?

1225
01:36:32,365 --> 01:36:43,935
MATT: Eyes shift back and forth over the rest of
you here, "I have an interest in games of chance

1226
01:36:43,935 --> 01:36:53,240
"on occasion, yes. So, you come all this way to
play games?"

1227
01:36:53,240 --> 01:37:00,906
SAM: Yes, I have. I spend my life just playing
games. It's my livelihood. I've won many things

1228
01:37:00,906 --> 01:37:09,798
over the years. In fact, all of these great
people, large and small next to me, I won in

1229
01:37:09,798 --> 01:37:16,181
various card games around the planes. That one
over there, the big one, I won him in a game of

1230
01:37:16,181 --> 01:37:26,911
Gin Rummy in the Feywild. This guy I picked up in
a game of Fish. I'm here to collect, possibly, one

1231
01:37:26,911 --> 01:37:29,484
of your items, if that's all right with you?

1232
01:37:29,484 --> 01:37:34,828
MATT: Make a deception check.

1233
01:37:34,828 --> 01:37:35,985
SAM: 32.

1234
01:37:35,985 --> 01:37:40,526
(laughter)

1235
01:37:40,526 --> 01:37:48,007
MATT: Leans even farther forward, to where it's
about two feet between you and her large eyes that

1236
01:37:48,007 --> 01:37:51,856
have come in, and her chin is scraping against the
wood to get a really good look at you. She looks

1237
01:37:51,856 --> 01:37:59,823
over, her red pupils slowly inspecting you. The
grin grows even wider as she leans back, "Well,

1238
01:37:59,823 --> 01:38:09,115
"you intrigue me, small one. If your luck has been
so great as to collect these fine specimens of

1239
01:38:09,115 --> 01:38:16,350
"strangers and you bring them all with you to such
a place. Where do you hail from, if I might ask?"

1240
01:38:16,350 --> 01:38:21,108
SAM: Places. That information is not relevant
right now.

1241
01:38:21,108 --> 01:38:26,994
MATT: "Fair enough. So! You come to play me for
what?"

1242
01:38:26,994 --> 01:38:32,169
SAM: Maybe I'll decide after our match.

1243
01:38:32,169 --> 01:38:41,418
MATT: "Well, I need to know what the ante is, so I
can ask for a suitable request for my side."

1244
01:38:41,418 --> 01:38:43,754
SAM: Certainly.

1245
01:38:43,754 --> 01:38:53,326
TALIESIN: I'm going to lean in and-- (no vocals)

1246
01:38:53,326 --> 01:38:57,206
SAM: There's a large ruby shield back there, is
that true?

1247
01:38:57,206 --> 01:38:58,889
MATT: "Ah, yes."

1248
01:38:58,889 --> 01:39:05,939
SAM: He wants that, but I think his taste sucks.
So I'm going to go for that brass piece of armor

1249
01:39:05,939 --> 01:39:07,390
back there.

1250
01:39:07,390 --> 01:39:12,167
MATT: "Ah, interesting. So you wish to play for
the armor?"

1251
01:39:12,167 --> 01:39:18,262
SAM: Sure, I'm a little man, and it
might help me in a fight someday if I ever lose.

1252
01:39:18,262 --> 01:39:28,444
MATT: "Fair enough. So." She leans behind and
pulls out a wooden box from a small cubby. And you

1253
01:39:28,444 --> 01:39:32,074
now look behind the desk and there are a series of
cubbies that are embedded in the wall. And there

1254
01:39:32,074 --> 01:39:38,354
are different things that she's thrown in there.
She pulls out this wooden box, unlocks it with her

1255
01:39:38,354 --> 01:39:49,425
heavy fingers, and opens it. She pulls out a deck
of cards that is larger than what you're used to

1256
01:39:49,490 --> 01:39:56,476
playing with, but small enough that you could
functionally hold a hand. Small from her

1257
01:39:56,476 --> 01:39:58,356
perspective. Kind of.

1258
01:39:58,356 --> 01:40:03,668
(laughter)

1259
01:40:03,668 --> 01:40:08,085
SAM: Let me cut the cards.

1260
01:40:08,085 --> 01:40:10,462
TRAVIS: And you die.

1261
01:40:10,462 --> 01:40:20,522
MATT: She takes it and closes the box. Begins to
shuffle them, without even looking away from you.

1262
01:40:20,522 --> 01:40:33,245
As she looks at you, she cocks a bit of a
half-smile to one side and says, "So for that, do

1263
01:40:33,245 --> 01:40:45,114
"you know the history of this? For you to come so
far to play a game, there may be a reason you

1264
01:40:45,114 --> 01:40:54,196
"come. And the thing you select for the game we
play has much value to you."

1265
01:40:54,196 --> 01:41:04,955
SAM: Honestly, the game itself is what's of value
to me. I am just happy to win and keep my winning

1266
01:41:05,013 --> 01:41:07,909
streak alive. What I get out of it is
meaningless.

1267
01:41:07,909 --> 01:41:09,958
MATT: "Okay."

1268
01:41:09,958 --> 01:41:13,488
SAM: But if you'd like to enlighten me on that
object--

1269
01:41:13,488 --> 01:41:22,628
MATT: "We will play three hands. The winner of two
takes the pot."

1270
01:41:22,628 --> 01:41:25,214
LAURA: (dry heaves)

1271
01:41:25,214 --> 01:41:33,671
MATT: "Request the armor. Me, I request your
friends."

1272
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:37,176
LAURA: I knew that's where she was
going to go with this.

1273
01:41:37,176 --> 01:41:42,729
SAM: Well, I was going to offer one of your
choosing. But you've only offered me one of your

1274
01:41:42,729 --> 01:41:44,134
items.

1275
01:41:44,134 --> 01:41:51,011
MATT: "Take it or leave it. If you <i>truly</i> have no
idea what this armor is worth, perhaps you wish to

1276
01:41:51,011 --> 01:41:53,299
"choose another thing to ante."

1277
01:41:53,299 --> 01:42:00,197
SAM: You seem attached to it. I want it. I'll have
it.

1278
01:42:00,197 --> 01:42:02,719
MATT: "How badly do you want it?"

1279
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:06,295
SAM: Certainly badly enough to risk these
scoundrels.

1280
01:42:06,295 --> 01:42:08,430
MATT: "Then we have an accord."

1281
01:42:08,430 --> 01:42:09,750
SAM: We do.

1282
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:14,161
MARISHA: Hell yeah! Let's do this!

1283
01:42:14,161 --> 01:42:15,592
TRAVIS: I've never been an ante before.

1284
01:42:15,592 --> 01:42:17,361
LIAM: Stone-cold gnome.

1285
01:42:17,361 --> 01:42:19,502
TALIESIN: So many bad ideas start with--

1286
01:42:19,502 --> 01:42:23,204
LAURA: Do we need to all sit on the table, then?

1287
01:42:23,204 --> 01:42:25,869
MARISHA: Does it work like Vegas? Are all the odds
on the house?

1288
01:42:25,869 --> 01:42:27,216
TRAVIS: Is it wizard's chess?

1289
01:42:27,216 --> 01:42:32,325
SAM: May I ask what game we're playing? Blackjack?
Are we playing--

1290
01:42:32,325 --> 01:42:34,346
TRAVIS: Strip poker!

1291
01:42:34,346 --> 01:42:37,714
SAM: Strip poker? Five-card stud?

1292
01:42:37,714 --> 01:42:40,723
(laughter)

1293
01:42:40,723 --> 01:42:49,046
MATT: "We refer to it as the Tinder Start. But you
probably know of it as the Gambit of Ord."

1294
01:42:49,046 --> 01:42:51,005
SAM: We've played this before?

1295
01:42:51,005 --> 01:42:53,612
MARISHA: Wait, did we end up playing it?

1296
01:42:53,612 --> 01:42:56,122
MATT: This is the thing you didn't end up
playing.

1297
01:42:56,122 --> 01:42:59,748
MARISHA: Fucking fuck! We didn't end up playing
this. But wait, we remember the rules?

1298
01:42:59,748 --> 01:43:08,853
MATT: You didn't play it. You, make an
intelligence check. Being a bard that you are. And

1299
01:43:08,853 --> 01:43:10,193
add a +2 to it.

1300
01:43:10,193 --> 01:43:11,301
TRAVIS: Get the Hand Cone out!

1301
01:43:11,301 --> 01:43:12,518
SAM: 21.

1302
01:43:12,518 --> 01:43:14,051
MATT: You <i>have</i> played this game.

1303
01:43:14,051 --> 01:43:17,747
LAURA: Thank god! Do you suck at it?

1304
01:43:17,747 --> 01:43:20,398
SAM: I suck at everything.

1305
01:43:20,398 --> 01:43:29,898
MATT: The hand is represented. Each of you roll a
d8, but you keep the die hidden. Then you both

1306
01:43:29,898 --> 01:43:38,762
roll a d6, and then keep it secret. Then you both
roll a d4, and then reveal them all together. But

1307
01:43:38,762 --> 01:43:41,502
you can raise it as you wish.

1308
01:43:41,502 --> 01:43:44,669
TRAVIS: You raise after each roll?

1309
01:43:44,669 --> 01:43:45,816
MATT: Yeah.

1310
01:43:45,816 --> 01:43:47,760
LAURA: What's the goal? What are you trying to
get to?

1311
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:52,535
MATT: The highest number between the three rolls.
But you can fold if you want to. This usually is

1312
01:43:52,535 --> 01:43:59,259
done in a betting type circumstance, so we'll see
how things go from here. Anyway, finishes

1313
01:43:59,259 --> 01:44:04,028
shuffling. Tosses you a series of cards. Takes a
couple cards for herself. Sets the deck aside,

1314
01:44:04,028 --> 01:44:09,708
right in front of her. The two guards in the back,
by the way, we hear them stepping away and

1315
01:44:09,708 --> 01:44:14,597
retrieve their weapons, and head back behind you
guys. Just keeping them at their sides.

1316
01:44:14,597 --> 01:44:19,987
LIAM: So in this room, let's say you're her, and
we're all where we are, and the giants are behind

1317
01:44:19,987 --> 01:44:22,386
the group, is that about right?

1318
01:44:22,386 --> 01:44:23,271
MATT: Yes.

1319
01:44:23,271 --> 01:44:25,531
LIAM: And how much room is there behind her and
the wall?

1320
01:44:25,531 --> 01:44:28,881
MATT: Maybe 15 feet, 20 feet.

1321
01:44:28,881 --> 01:44:41,289
LIAM: I'm going to slowly tippie-toe around the
side of the wall, carefully avoiding giants. I want

1322
01:44:41,289 --> 01:44:45,418
to stand not directly behind her, but off at an
angle.

1323
01:44:45,418 --> 01:44:48,415
MATT: Make a stealth check.

1324
01:44:48,415 --> 01:44:59,015
LIAM: 30.

1325
01:44:59,015 --> 01:45:11,045
MATT: Okay. You both take a look at your hands. Go
ahead and roll a d8. Okay.

1326
01:45:11,045 --> 01:45:12,577
SAM: And now?

1327
01:45:12,577 --> 01:45:21,927
MATT: So, for this circumstance, we'll go ahead
and take a d6. Roll it and put it next to the die.

1328
01:45:21,927 --> 01:45:26,215
All right. And now take a d4.

1329
01:45:26,215 --> 01:45:28,692
SAM: And if we fold, do we start over?

1330
01:45:28,692 --> 01:45:31,084
MATT: If you fold, you lose the round.

1331
01:45:31,084 --> 01:45:32,528
SAM: Oh, well then it's just a number.

1332
01:45:32,528 --> 01:45:33,964
LAURA: So it's just numbers, at this point?

1333
01:45:33,964 --> 01:45:37,044
MATT: At this point, yeah. You walked into a game
of her choice.

1334
01:45:37,044 --> 01:45:39,791
LAURA: There's no way to cheat.

1335
01:45:39,791 --> 01:45:44,796
LIAM: So there's three rolls in a row, and she's
done two. Can we see them from where I am?

1336
01:45:44,796 --> 01:45:51,029
MATT: You currently went around the table?

1337
01:45:51,029 --> 01:45:54,470
LIAM: Yeah, I'm at an angle, but I'm a lot lower
than she is.

1338
01:45:54,470 --> 01:46:00,982
MATT: Make a perception check.

1339
01:46:00,982 --> 01:46:05,577
LIAM: Luck. That's fine. 22.

1340
01:46:05,577 --> 01:46:08,880
MATT: You get a good glance at the first two
cards, yes.

1341
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:20,556
LIAM: Can I (mutters inaudibly) in the earring, as
quiet as a mouse? Can I just breathe it?

1342
01:46:20,556 --> 01:46:24,376
MATT: Make a stealth check.

1343
01:46:24,376 --> 01:46:25,463
LIAM: With advantage?

1344
01:46:25,463 --> 01:46:27,528
MATT: Not with advantage because it's an audio
thing.

1345
01:46:27,528 --> 01:46:32,309
LIAM: Is it three rolls? I don't understand the
game.

1346
01:46:32,309 --> 01:46:36,845
LAURA: There's no way we can cheat! Because the
ante's already on the table!

1347
01:46:36,845 --> 01:46:38,087
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to wait.

1348
01:46:38,087 --> 01:46:40,371
LAURA: Right, there's no way to cheat?

1349
01:46:40,371 --> 01:46:42,421
MATT: That you can think of.

1350
01:46:42,421 --> 01:46:47,622
LAURA: Unless you can fudge the dice!

1351
01:46:47,622 --> 01:46:49,625
MARISHA: But that's risky.

1352
01:46:49,625 --> 01:46:51,890
LAURA: It's technically cards.

1353
01:46:51,890 --> 01:46:56,602
MATT: It's cards. The dice is just the mechanic
for it. Take a look at your hand.

1354
01:46:56,602 --> 01:47:00,950
SAM: I know my hand. Wait, am I rolling the d4 or
no?

1355
01:47:00,950 --> 01:47:09,409
MATT: We rolled the d8 and the d6. She looks down
and goes, "All right. So, to make this even more

1356
01:47:09,409 --> 01:47:20,458
"interesting. I'll wait. Let us see how the first
hand goes, shall we?" And she puts her third card

1357
01:47:20,458 --> 01:47:23,740
in front of her, face down. Roll now.

1358
01:47:23,740 --> 01:47:27,701
SAM: (quietly) Not good, you guys.

1359
01:47:27,701 --> 01:47:43,186
MATT: "And call." And she turns the cards over.
"Four, six, one." A total of 11.

1360
01:47:43,186 --> 01:47:48,742
SAM: One, five, two. Total of eight.

1361
01:47:48,742 --> 01:47:58,851
MATT: "That is an unfortunate way to open it, my
small friend. But you seem keen on winning, and I

1362
01:47:58,851 --> 01:48:06,165
"respect that." She takes the cards, places them to
the side. Deals out a new hand, brings it back to

1363
01:48:06,165 --> 01:48:13,415
her. "Shall we begin?" Go ahead and roll your d8.

1364
01:48:13,415 --> 01:48:15,544
SAM: Oh, man, this is just straight rolls.

1365
01:48:15,544 --> 01:48:20,038
TRAVIS: We're going to kill everybody in this
motherfucking house!

1366
01:48:20,038 --> 01:48:22,623
LAURA: There's no way to fucking sleight of hand
this shit, is there?

1367
01:48:22,623 --> 01:48:24,112
MARISHA: Can he add his Bardic Inspiration?

1368
01:48:24,112 --> 01:48:26,413
MATT: No, this isn't an ability check.

1369
01:48:26,413 --> 01:48:31,859
ASHLEY: If I cast Enhance Ability on him?

1370
01:48:31,859 --> 01:48:37,068
LAURA: Maybe, can you pray for Sarenrae?

1371
01:48:37,068 --> 01:48:43,526
MATT: This is quite literally a game of chance. If
you wanted to try and fuck around with a creative

1372
01:48:43,526 --> 01:48:47,967
way to cheat, you're welcome to try. That could also
go very poorly, depending on how it goes. Before

1373
01:48:47,967 --> 01:49:01,161
you do the next one, she stops and goes, "So, as I
was going to say before. How about, as your

1374
01:49:01,161 --> 01:49:05,592
"friends are the ante on the table, throw yourself
in as well?"

1375
01:49:05,592 --> 01:49:09,724
SAM: And what will you give me if I win?

1376
01:49:09,724 --> 01:49:14,479
MATT: "Perhaps the ruby shield?"

1377
01:49:14,479 --> 01:49:20,698
SAM: I love myself a lot. A lot more 
than a bunch of rubies

1378
01:49:20,698 --> 01:49:27,418
and a handle, I'll tell you that much. If I'm
giving <i>myself</i> to slavery forever, I want

1379
01:49:27,418 --> 01:49:34,760
something a hell of a lot better than that. I'm a
man who's won 500 straight card games in a row.

1380
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:38,878
You think these slaves are something? You should
see what I have at home.

1381
01:49:38,878 --> 01:49:42,837
MATT: Make a deception check.

1382
01:49:42,837 --> 01:49:47,308
SAM: 32.

1383
01:49:47,308 --> 01:49:51,539
TRAVIS: Uh-oh.

1384
01:49:51,539 --> 01:49:53,323
LAURA: Oh no.

1385
01:49:53,323 --> 01:49:55,156
MATT: She nods.

1386
01:49:55,156 --> 01:50:05,183
SAM: I'll give you myself as a slave if you do
<i>not</i> draw your next card and skip straight to the

1387
01:50:05,183 --> 01:50:12,493
third, and that's your number. I get all three.

1388
01:50:12,493 --> 01:50:17,127
MATT: "Very well."

1389
01:50:17,127 --> 01:50:19,117
TRAVIS: Oh, nice, dude!

1390
01:50:19,117 --> 01:50:21,456
LAURA: Oh, hopefully she didn't roll an eight on
that first one.

1391
01:50:21,456 --> 01:50:23,476
MATT: She rolled, the first die is placed there.

1392
01:50:23,476 --> 01:50:25,564
LAURA and TRAVIS: She rolled an eight?!?

1393
01:50:25,564 --> 01:50:27,754
SAM: Oh, fucking balls. Fuck balls.

1394
01:50:27,754 --> 01:50:31,104
(laughter)

1395
01:50:31,104 --> 01:50:35,683
LAURA: We have to be ready to fight. Grab it and
then Jenga out.

1396
01:50:35,683 --> 01:50:37,788
MATT: She rolled her last card but is not
showing.

1397
01:50:37,788 --> 01:50:40,661
ASHLEY: But take the shield, too, though. Take the
shield!

1398
01:50:40,661 --> 01:50:46,466
SAM: (whispers) Pretty bad.

1399
01:50:46,466 --> 01:50:52,492
TALIESIN: No, we're good. Tell her to show her
last card.

1400
01:50:52,492 --> 01:50:54,278
LAURA: Maybe it's a one.

1401
01:50:54,278 --> 01:50:59,492
MATT: It's a two. "A ten. What did you roll?"

1402
01:50:59,492 --> 01:51:08,585
TALIESIN: I cast Minor Illusion on the first card,
to turn the three into an eight.

1403
01:51:08,585 --> 01:51:13,907
MATT: As you begin to mutter the incantation under
your breath, she says, "I would not recommend

1404
01:51:13,907 --> 01:51:17,204
"bringing incantations into our game of chance."

1405
01:51:17,204 --> 01:51:31,399
SAM: Before I reveal my cards, I have one more
proposal.

1406
01:51:31,399 --> 01:51:36,276
MATT: "Yes?"

1407
01:51:36,276 --> 01:51:37,793
SAM: (whispers) I don't know what it is.

1408
01:51:37,793 --> 01:51:40,746
(laughter)

1409
01:51:40,746 --> 01:51:43,162
LAURA: Maybe we can perform for her?

1410
01:51:43,162 --> 01:51:49,215
SAM: I'll come clean with you. We know exactly
what that fucking piece of armor is.

1411
01:51:49,215 --> 01:51:50,839
MATT: "I had a feeling."

1412
01:51:50,839 --> 01:51:53,269
(laughter)

1413
01:51:53,269 --> 01:52:00,404
SAM: We want it. We're not leaving
here without it. I'm sorry, I'm not going to show

1414
01:52:00,404 --> 01:52:08,146
you my cards. Because before I do, you'll be dead.
Sorry, guys.

1415
01:52:08,146 --> 01:52:22,825
MATT: She turns her head to the side, "You do not
want to walk this path, do you? Because if you

1416
01:52:22,825 --> 01:52:33,276
"truly cherish the lives that you and your friends
here have, based on your current change in tone,

1417
01:52:33,276 --> 01:52:43,296
"this tells me that they now belong to me. Perhaps
you would wish to continue to make this agreement

1418
01:52:43,296 --> 01:52:54,186
"you came to make. Show me your card."

1419
01:52:54,186 --> 01:52:59,577
SAM: I drew a three, and a three, and a three.

1420
01:52:59,577 --> 01:53:01,935
TRAVIS: Oh, that sucks!

1421
01:53:01,935 --> 01:53:10,632
MATT: "By one each time. Perhaps it was time for
you to lose cards after all. Based on our

1422
01:53:10,632 --> 01:53:22,508
"agreement, you and your friends are now property
of Juuraiel. However, I see that you are traveled.

1423
01:53:22,508 --> 01:53:35,883
"You seem capable. You are bold. You walk in here
after acquiring the will of Whaska. So, you want

1424
01:53:35,883 --> 01:53:37,950
"freedom, yes?"

1425
01:53:37,950 --> 01:53:39,969
SAM: Yes?

1426
01:53:39,969 --> 01:53:47,698
MATT: "Then perhaps there is a favor
you can do for me. In exchange for this favor, I

1427
01:53:47,698 --> 01:53:54,658
"will nullify our contract, and you will be free to
go. Does this sound viable?"

1428
01:53:54,658 --> 01:53:57,864
SAM: Possibly. Is it a card game?

1429
01:53:57,864 --> 01:54:05,907
MATT: "The other choice is you are now mine. Or,
as you threatened boldly before, that I was to

1430
01:54:05,907 --> 01:54:11,776
"die. But I can say, given the current place that
you reside, the enchantments I have on this room,

1431
01:54:11,776 --> 01:54:17,683
"the friends of mine that I have at your back, you
will not have the outcome you wish."

1432
01:54:17,683 --> 01:54:20,884
SAM: What is your offer?

1433
01:54:20,884 --> 01:54:23,442
MATT: "Do you agree?"

1434
01:54:23,442 --> 01:54:26,652
LAURA: Did you ever meet a dragon named Thordak?

1435
01:54:26,652 --> 01:54:28,486
MATT: "No."

1436
01:54:28,486 --> 01:54:34,169
LAURA: Fuck. Big red guy? Took a lot of fire
giants with him?

1437
01:54:34,169 --> 01:54:37,235
MATT: "There are a number of red dragons that
walk."

1438
01:54:37,235 --> 01:54:41,782
LAURA: This one was special. He had an enormous
jewel in his chest.

1439
01:54:41,782 --> 01:54:49,369
MATT: "Sounds worthwhile. But do you agree to our
arrangement?"

1440
01:54:49,369 --> 01:54:54,631
SAM: Just curious, can we draw the third hand? I
just want to feel what it feels like to win once.

1441
01:54:54,631 --> 01:55:01,369
ASHLEY: What about best out of five? You're
probably so bored with life; why not?

1442
01:55:01,369 --> 01:55:04,795
SAM: My slave speaks the truth.

1443
01:55:04,795 --> 01:55:15,505
MATT: "You are full of spunk and life. And you are
foolish. Do you agree to our accord?"

1444
01:55:15,505 --> 01:55:24,112
SAM: I'm really curious about this last hand. If
you beat me in this last hand, I agree.

1445
01:55:24,112 --> 01:55:28,908
MATT: "If I beat you in this hand, you agree.
Otherwise, what? I still own you?"

1446
01:55:28,908 --> 01:55:34,158
SAM: Yes. Well, that's the deal.

1447
01:55:34,158 --> 01:55:36,392
TRAVIS: Yeah, I like that. Maybe you'll win
one.

1448
01:55:36,392 --> 01:55:38,717
ASHLEY: One more hand?

1449
01:55:38,717 --> 01:55:41,657
MATT: "We will see who wins this hand for your own
sake."

1450
01:55:41,657 --> 01:55:44,152
SAM: Thank you. That would make me feel so
much better about myself.

1451
01:55:44,152 --> 01:56:09,205
MATT: "It does <i>not</i> change our deal." First die.
Second. And third. She reveals four, four, four.

1452
01:56:09,205 --> 01:56:11,338
Literally rolled all fours.

1453
01:56:11,338 --> 01:56:13,272
TRAVIS: God! Matt! You!

1454
01:56:13,272 --> 01:56:15,970
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Wow.

1455
01:56:15,970 --> 01:56:18,267
SAM: I'm really just bad at everything.

1456
01:56:18,267 --> 01:56:19,649
TRAVIS: Did you roll an 11?

1457
01:56:19,649 --> 01:56:20,962
SAM: I rolled an 11.

1458
01:56:20,962 --> 01:56:22,532
MATT: Oh my God!

1459
01:56:22,532 --> 01:56:27,188
TRAVIS: You are a deity.

1460
01:56:27,188 --> 01:56:32,596
MATT: I wish I had this luck in Vegas! Like,
literal gambling.

1461
01:56:32,596 --> 01:56:33,945
TRAVIS: It's just four hours.

1462
01:56:33,945 --> 01:56:35,388
SAM: Best seven out of 13!

1463
01:56:35,388 --> 01:56:37,776
(laughter)

1464
01:56:37,776 --> 01:56:40,785
MATT: "You have agreed to our accord as per the
agreement."

1465
01:56:40,785 --> 01:56:47,229
SAM: I have agreed. I'm already your slave,
so I couldn't really say no. So yes, I

1466
01:56:47,229 --> 01:56:50,273
agree to our accord. What favor can I grant you?

1467
01:56:50,273 --> 01:57:13,261
MATT: "You will have your freedom and the armor
you seek. My lover does not live because of an

1468
01:57:13,261 --> 01:57:26,931
"altercation with one who frequents the city. My
partner, Drogat, died needlessly in the streets of

1469
01:57:26,931 --> 01:57:33,930
"an innocent altercation with Ghurrix, a pit fiend
that lives at the embassy."

1470
01:57:33,930 --> 01:57:37,766
LAURA: (groaning) Ah jeez.

1471
01:57:37,766 --> 01:57:40,946
SAM: Sorry, we're not supposed to go to the
embassy. We were told so by our tour guide.

1472
01:57:40,946 --> 01:57:50,345
MATT: "Oh, you should never go to the embassy. But
this Ghurrix is tied up with a lot of politics in

1473
01:57:50,345 --> 01:58:01,231
"this city. As much as I would love to squeeze what
infernal life he has, I fear it would cause the

1474
01:58:01,231 --> 01:58:10,718
"execution of me and mine. So, I sit and fester
with the need of vengeance. I need you, if you're

1475
01:58:10,718 --> 01:58:23,000
"as capable as you promise, to go and find
Ghurrix, in whatever way you see fit, and carve

1476
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:36,785
"the life from his body. Now, Ghurrix frequents the
Arches, which is the slave market of the city,

1477
01:58:36,785 --> 01:58:47,054
"where he finds rare and unique servants for the
Nine Hells and his masters there. Goes about once

1478
01:58:47,054 --> 01:59:01,453
"a week and is probably due there in a day or two.
Go, slay Ghurrix, and return to me with no mention

1479
01:59:01,453 --> 01:59:11,177
"and no trace that can be brought back to my home.
Then the armor is yours, as is your freedom.

1480
01:59:11,177 --> 01:59:16,470
"There is no agreement. You've already agreed. So
go."

1481
01:59:16,470 --> 01:59:28,842
SAM: Yes, we accept. Thank you, my master, we will
go do so right away. Two days, you say?

1482
01:59:28,842 --> 01:59:31,614
MATT: "Two days, yes."

1483
01:59:31,614 --> 01:59:36,444
LAURA: Does that mean we don't have to answer to
you anymore? You're equal to us?

1484
01:59:36,444 --> 01:59:37,728
SAM: Yes.

1485
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:40,374
MARISHA: High five, yeah!

1486
01:59:40,374 --> 01:59:45,375
SAM: I release you from your slavery.

1487
01:59:45,375 --> 01:59:48,423
MARISHA: And into another one.

1488
01:59:48,423 --> 01:59:52,932
SAM: What does he look like?

1489
01:59:52,932 --> 02:00:07,241
MATT: She reaches down to the side of the desk,
and pulls out a very small book, relative size,

1490
02:00:07,241 --> 02:00:24,682
and flips through, and opens a page to turn
towards you. "<i>This</i> is what I seek to see

1491
02:00:24,682 --> 02:00:38,252
"destroyed. You can tell, Ghurrix wears a symbol of
his station. It is a thick, black chain. And at

1492
02:00:38,252 --> 02:00:46,075
"the bottom, it has the symbol of two manacles
intertwined within a red symbol that pulses with

1493
02:00:46,075 --> 02:00:50,104
"anger. That is your mark."

1494
02:00:50,104 --> 02:00:56,590
SAM: Are you sure you don't want just a game of
Pinochle instead?

1495
02:00:56,590 --> 02:01:01,047
MATT: "You try my patience, small one."

1496
02:01:01,047 --> 02:01:05,623
SAM: Please, call me Kenny Rogers.

1497
02:01:05,623 --> 02:01:09,419
MATT: "Two days. Go!"

1498
02:01:09,419 --> 02:01:14,841
SAM: Let's go, slaves! I'm sorry, equals, peers,
let's go!

1499
02:01:14,841 --> 02:01:21,569
MATT: As you guys step down, the two giant guards
step back and begin to walk towards the door to

1500
02:01:21,569 --> 02:01:22,541
let you out.

1501
02:01:22,541 --> 02:01:27,935
LAURA: Actually, madam, master. Do you have any
symbols that you can give us, like something we

1502
02:01:27,935 --> 02:01:31,736
could show people so they don't try to claim us
for themselves? Because we're a lot smaller than

1503
02:01:31,736 --> 02:01:34,994
everyone else here. Something that shows that
we're <i>your</i> slaves?

1504
02:01:34,994 --> 02:01:46,179
MATT: "Hmm." She gets up from behind the desk, and
walks up the stairs for a moment.

1505
02:01:46,179 --> 02:01:49,943
LAURA: Is she out of the room?

1506
02:01:49,943 --> 02:01:51,390
MATT: She's out of the room, currently.

1507
02:01:51,390 --> 02:01:52,803
LAURA: And two other giants are behind us?

1508
02:01:52,803 --> 02:01:54,068
MATT: Yes.

1509
02:01:54,068 --> 02:01:55,538
LAURA: What are they doing?

1510
02:01:55,538 --> 02:01:57,201
MATT: They're standing watching all of you.

1511
02:01:57,201 --> 02:01:59,037
LAURA: All of us except for--

1512
02:01:59,037 --> 02:02:01,090
LIAM: I'm standing there, but I'm not--

1513
02:02:01,090 --> 02:02:04,005
LAURA: Jump up and fucking see how it's
attached to the wall!

1514
02:02:04,005 --> 02:02:07,339
TRAVIS: How big is the suit of armor, the
Dawnmartyr?

1515
02:02:07,339 --> 02:02:23,628
MATT: It would fit a human. A minute passes. You
hear the footfalls return. As she comes down the

1516
02:02:23,628 --> 02:02:28,614
stairs, with her hand in a fist, she throws her
hand open. Hitting the ground, and scattering

1517
02:02:28,614 --> 02:02:36,907
across the stonework, some of them stopping at
your feet or beyond, a series of black, metal

1518
02:02:36,907 --> 02:02:39,990
rings that match the ones that the two giants wear
around their neck.

1519
02:02:39,990 --> 02:02:41,812
TRAVIS: But smaller.

1520
02:02:41,812 --> 02:02:45,647
MATT: But smaller. Various sizes. There's probably
like a dozen or so you can pick from. Some will

1521
02:02:45,647 --> 02:02:55,277
fit better than others. "These I had made, but I
had no need for servants of your size until today.

1522
02:02:55,277 --> 02:02:59,465
"So, go. These should be enough."

1523
02:02:59,465 --> 02:03:03,858
LAURA: Thank you. They're lovely.

1524
02:03:03,858 --> 02:03:06,979
TRAVIS: Yeah, I put mine on. I like it a lot.

1525
02:03:06,979 --> 02:03:09,686
SAM: Have a lovely afternoon.

1526
02:03:09,686 --> 02:03:14,343
MATT: "You as well. Good luck. Please, kill it.
Return."

1527
02:03:14,343 --> 02:03:17,504
TRAVIS: Do we want to stay the night here?

1528
02:03:17,504 --> 02:03:19,777
MARISHA: Yeah, I was going to ask that.

1529
02:03:19,777 --> 02:03:22,517
SAM: Gross, but okay, go ahead.

1530
02:03:22,517 --> 02:03:32,471
TRAVIS: A quick query. We're, like, visitors. We
don't really have a place to stay. Now that we're

1531
02:03:32,471 --> 02:03:34,481
yours, do you have like a broom cupboard?

1532
02:03:34,481 --> 02:03:41,532
MATT: Senokir pipes up and goes, "Actually, you're
welcome to stay at our place. We have facilities

1533
02:03:41,532 --> 02:03:46,559
"that could function. Besides, it's a lot of chain
we have to carry back now."

1534
02:03:46,559 --> 02:03:48,804
TALIESIN: It's true.

1535
02:03:48,804 --> 02:03:55,275
LAURA: We'll do you the favor, Senokir, of
carrying this chain back to your place.

1536
02:03:55,275 --> 02:03:57,431
MATT: "That's wonderful, thank you."

1537
02:03:57,431 --> 02:04:00,062
LAURA: A favor for a favor. (giggles)

1538
02:04:00,062 --> 02:04:02,875
MATT: "Indeed. We'll talk soon about mine."

1539
02:04:02,875 --> 02:04:10,301
TRAVIS: He's going to wear us like winter coats.
Going to make a suit out of our skin.

1540
02:04:10,301 --> 02:04:11,947
MARISHA: Nice lampshade.

1541
02:04:11,947 --> 02:04:15,980
LAURA: Ooh, his eyebrows literally going up when
you said that. I think he wants to do it.

1542
02:04:15,980 --> 02:04:28,123
MATT: So, the door is lifted. You guys are led
back out onto the street. Closes behind you.

1543
02:04:28,123 --> 02:04:34,617
The time that has passed now, I need everyone once
again to roll another constitution saving throw.

1544
02:04:34,617 --> 02:04:38,047
TRAVIS: But I drank that Fox's Cunning.

1545
02:04:38,047 --> 02:04:41,520
MARISHA: Am I okay?

1546
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:43,793
TALIESIN: We're going to be fine, anyway. We have
the mansion.

1547
02:04:43,793 --> 02:04:45,166
TRAVIS: 24.

1548
02:04:45,166 --> 02:04:47,290
TALIESIN: 11.

1549
02:04:47,290 --> 02:04:50,133
SAM: 20.

1550
02:04:50,133 --> 02:04:53,100
MARISHA: Do I still have fire resist?

1551
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:55,345
MATT: Your fire resist would have gone away. You
could cast it again.

1552
02:04:55,345 --> 02:04:59,285
MARISHA: I'll just roll this time. It's just
straight constitution?

1553
02:04:59,285 --> 02:05:00,985
LAURA: Saving throw.

1554
02:05:00,985 --> 02:05:02,780
ASHLEY: With a saving throw?

1555
02:05:02,780 --> 02:05:04,176
MATT: Yeah.

1556
02:05:04,176 --> 02:05:05,622
ASHLEY: So roll another.

1557
02:05:05,622 --> 02:05:07,965
MATT: Well, no. You roll and then you add your
saving throw bonus.

1558
02:05:07,965 --> 02:05:09,530
MARISHA: Seven.

1559
02:05:09,530 --> 02:05:14,108
MATT: Vex?

1560
02:05:14,108 --> 02:05:15,684
LAURA: Four.

1561
02:05:15,684 --> 02:05:17,167
ASHLEY: Three!

1562
02:05:17,167 --> 02:05:25,228
MATT: All right. Pike, Vex, Keyleth, and Percy all
suffer a point of exhaustion. Pike, your speed is

1563
02:05:25,228 --> 02:05:26,383
halved right now.

1564
02:05:26,383 --> 02:05:28,342
LAURA: Oh no, Pike, but you're already so little!

1565
02:05:28,342 --> 02:05:29,480
ASHLEY: My what's halved?

1566
02:05:29,480 --> 02:05:30,808
MATT: Your speed is halved, so you are trailing
behind everybody.

1567
02:05:30,808 --> 02:05:32,654
LAURA: Grog, pick her up, she looks like she needs
some water.

1568
02:05:32,654 --> 02:05:34,133
ASHLEY: Grog, I'm just so tired.

1569
02:05:34,133 --> 02:05:35,511
TRAVIS: You look so mopey.

1570
02:05:35,511 --> 02:05:37,316
ASHLEY: I feel very mopey.

1571
02:05:37,316 --> 02:05:38,938
TRAVIS: Did you want a piggyback ride?

1572
02:05:38,938 --> 02:05:40,503
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1573
02:05:40,503 --> 02:05:44,324
TRAVIS: All right, I pick her up and I put her
on my shoulder.

1574
02:05:44,324 --> 02:05:50,019
MATT: You guys eventually make your way back,
being led by Senokir back to his establishment.

1575
02:05:50,019 --> 02:05:58,348
Let's go ahead and take a little break for now. Go
ahead and use the restroom--

1576
02:05:58,348 --> 02:06:01,489
TRAVIS: You looked like the creepy guy was saying we
should take a break for just a second.

1577
02:06:01,489 --> 02:06:11,947
MATT: "That would be frightening, wouldn't it?" All
right, guys, we'll be back in just a few minutes,

1578
02:06:11,947 --> 02:06:13,878
we'll see you in a second.

1579
02:06:13,878 --> 02:23:49,732
[break]

1580
02:23:49,732 --> 02:23:56,295
MATT: Welcome back everyone to Critical Role. That
was terrible.

1581
02:23:56,295 --> 02:23:58,188
TRAVIS: The timing. Well, she's been gone.

1582
02:23:58,188 --> 02:23:59,988
MATT: She's been gone a while. It's okay, welcome
back.

1583
02:23:59,988 --> 02:24:00,854
ASHLEY: I'm sorry.

1584
02:24:00,854 --> 02:24:01,826
MATT: Ashley, you're amazing.

1585
02:24:01,826 --> 02:24:03,187
ASHLEY: I'm just not working right now.

1586
02:24:03,187 --> 02:24:12,053
MATT: That's okay. So. You guys have returned to
Senokir and Uten's establishment to rest until you

1587
02:24:12,053 --> 02:24:18,342
feel is necessary to undertake this endeavor. But
it is your guys' prerogative as to if you want to

1588
02:24:18,342 --> 02:24:22,695
wait over the next day, day and a half to jump to
it or is there anything you want to do to prepare

1589
02:24:22,695 --> 02:24:24,441
for this circumstance? What do you want to do?

1590
02:24:24,441 --> 02:24:26,973
TALIESIN: Let's sleep in the mansion so we can
gain some of our--

1591
02:24:26,973 --> 02:24:29,326
LAURA: Yeah let's sleep in the mansion till we can
at least get rid of this <i>heat.</i>

1592
02:24:29,326 --> 02:24:36,181
SAM: If it's a day or two, we could go back to
Daxio and check and come back. But then we'd have

1593
02:24:36,181 --> 02:24:38,522
to get back into the city. That's probably a
terrible idea.

1594
02:24:38,584 --> 02:24:47,943
MARISHA: Can I bamf right here? What's your name?
What is Simma sina--

1595
02:24:47,943 --> 02:24:49,223
TRAVIS: Sequin.

1596
02:24:49,223 --> 02:24:56,498
MARISHA: Senokir. Took a ten-minute break and
that's it. Senokir, is there a way we could-- If I

1597
02:24:56,498 --> 02:25:02,526
wanted to Plane Shift home, is there a way that I
could Plane Shift right back here and not get, you

1598
02:25:02,526 --> 02:25:05,378
know, our heads chopped off for it?

1599
02:25:05,378 --> 02:25:07,914
MATT: "I don't know. Is there?"

1600
02:25:07,914 --> 02:25:17,338
MARISHA: Let me check, guys. You know, let me
check the druidic texts and see what they say.

1601
02:25:17,338 --> 02:25:22,800
MATT: Specifically, you can choose a target in
general terms. It'll probably bring you right back

1602
02:25:22,800 --> 02:25:26,654
to where you arrived here. So you'd be back to
the outside of the city.

1603
02:25:26,654 --> 02:25:28,296
LIAM: At the respawn point.

1604
02:25:28,296 --> 02:25:32,315
MARISHA: Well, I can't say Senokir's jewelry shop
in the City of Brass?

1605
02:25:32,315 --> 02:25:39,370
MATT: You can specify a target or destination in
general terms. So the City of Brass or Dispater on

1606
02:25:39,370 --> 02:25:42,754
the second level of the Nine Hells. You appear in
or near that destination.

1607
02:25:42,754 --> 02:25:48,337
SAM: No guarantee that we'd be back in. So we
should stay.

1608
02:25:48,337 --> 02:25:50,338
MATT: Up to you. Crapshoot, it's possible.

1609
02:25:50,338 --> 02:25:54,366
LAURA: As long as we know that Allura will send us
a message if something goes wrong.

1610
02:25:54,366 --> 02:25:57,649
LIAM: Did it get dark out at all? Or no?

1611
02:25:57,649 --> 02:26:03,784
MATT: Actually, by this time, as you guys have
gotten back and ended this rest you guys have

1612
02:26:03,784 --> 02:26:07,865
really come to get really thirsty, and as the
exhaustion hits in, you all continue to reach for

1613
02:26:07,865 --> 02:26:11,381
your waterskins and they're dried up.

1614
02:26:11,381 --> 02:26:14,190
TALIESIN: We should go back into the mansion.

1615
02:26:14,190 --> 02:26:15,411
SAM: I agree.

1616
02:26:15,411 --> 02:26:22,509
MATT: The sun, however, has gone to a darker red
color, like a soft eclipse almost. And as it does,

1617
02:26:22,509 --> 02:26:30,651
the heat remains but the light gets dimmer and
dimmer into a red twilight. And as it does, the

1618
02:26:30,651 --> 02:26:38,182
city shuts down. Everybody goes home, locks up,
and nothing but the efreet that you saw wandering the

1619
02:26:38,182 --> 02:26:45,264
streets earlier with the little flaming brooches
or amulets in the uniform outfit wander the streets.

1620
02:26:45,264 --> 02:26:47,971
LAURA: Why doesn't anyone go outside at night?

1621
02:26:47,971 --> 02:26:49,917
MATT: Pardon me. (sneezes)

1622
02:26:49,917 --> 02:26:50,796
MARISHA: Bless you.

1623
02:26:50,796 --> 02:26:51,661
LAURA: Bless you, Senokir.

1624
02:26:51,661 --> 02:26:52,304
MATT: (sneezes)

1625
02:26:52,304 --> 02:26:53,262
TRAVIS: Give me a third one.

1626
02:26:53,262 --> 02:26:54,252
MARISHA: Bless you again.

1627
02:26:54,252 --> 02:27:04,172
MATT: Fuck you. Hate you so much. Live gaming.
You ask this to Senokir?

1628
02:27:04,172 --> 02:27:05,255
LAURA: Yeah.

1629
02:27:05,255 --> 02:27:13,178
MATT: "That's largely because the Illuminated
maintain a curfew. And if you don't follow the

1630
02:27:13,178 --> 02:27:16,320
"curfew, you'll wind up in chains."

1631
02:27:16,320 --> 02:27:21,134
LAURA: Okay. Different chains than regular
chains?

1632
02:27:21,134 --> 02:27:22,570
MATT: "At first, yes."

1633
02:27:22,570 --> 02:27:23,910
LAURA: Okay.

1634
02:27:23,910 --> 02:27:27,899
TRAVIS: Waterskins from our servants--

1635
02:27:27,899 --> 02:27:29,974
LIAM: Who's that guy? What is that guy?

1636
02:27:29,974 --> 02:27:31,378
OFFSCREEN: Thanks, Gov'ner.

1637
02:27:31,378 --> 02:27:33,503
LAURA: What are we at?

1638
02:27:33,503 --> 02:27:34,575
MATT: "Kill him."

1639
02:27:34,575 --> 02:27:36,990
(laughter)

1640
02:27:36,990 --> 02:27:43,996
MATT: "If you require water I can procure that for
you, if you like."

1641
02:27:43,996 --> 02:27:47,012
LAURA: Hmm?

1642
02:27:47,012 --> 02:27:51,739
MATT: "If you want water I can procure that for
you."

1643
02:27:51,739 --> 02:27:53,515
TALIESIN: Can we get water from the--

1644
02:27:53,515 --> 02:27:56,896
SAM: Well, we have water in his fucking jug.

1645
02:27:56,896 --> 02:28:00,631
LAURA: Yeah. We've got so much water.

1646
02:28:00,631 --> 02:28:02,123
MARISHA: I can also create water.

1647
02:28:02,123 --> 02:28:03,976
LAURA: Yeah, but he's got a jug full of it.

1648
02:28:03,976 --> 02:28:06,304
MARISHA: Pike and I can create water. Me and Pike
both can.

1649
02:28:06,304 --> 02:28:08,862
TRAVIS: I can create water. Don't say it like it's
cool.

1650
02:28:08,862 --> 02:28:14,586
TALIESIN: They're not speaking in metaphor. We
know you can create water.

1651
02:28:14,586 --> 02:28:19,532
MATT: All right, so, what do you guys wish to do?

1652
02:28:19,532 --> 02:28:24,364
LIAM: I mean, are we in a hurry, do we want to
try to make this happen tonight?

1653
02:28:24,364 --> 02:28:29,380
TALIESIN: Let's mansion for the night and then I
think in the morning. We can't find him tonight.

1654
02:28:29,380 --> 02:28:30,398
Can we?

1655
02:28:30,398 --> 02:28:33,496
LIAM: I'm not talking about him, I'm talking about
doubling back to the house and trying to get

1656
02:28:33,496 --> 02:28:35,330
through the servants' window.

1657
02:28:35,330 --> 02:28:38,296
SAM: You really want to try to break into this
fire giant's house?

1658
02:28:38,296 --> 02:28:43,344
LIAM: If we're in a hurry, I mean we've killed
some pretty gnarly things, I know they're big. So

1659
02:28:43,344 --> 02:28:44,791
are we.

1660
02:28:44,791 --> 02:28:47,502
LAURA: She could be gnarlier than the giants that
we've fought.

1661
02:28:47,502 --> 02:28:52,353
TRAVIS: And there might be an unbelievable amount
of fire giants in that building.

1662
02:28:52,353 --> 02:28:53,353
SAM: Or traps.

1663
02:28:53,353 --> 02:28:56,702
MARISHA: Or allies nearby. It's in the middle of a
city.

1664
02:28:56,702 --> 02:29:00,508
LIAM: Yeah. And I'm sure the other thing will be
super easy.

1665
02:29:00,508 --> 02:29:03,844
LAURA: The pit fiend?

1666
02:29:03,844 --> 02:29:07,676
LIAM: It's on the table. I mean, whatever, you
know. I'm going to follow your lead.

1667
02:29:07,676 --> 02:29:10,185
SAM: You want to do a smash and grab?

1668
02:29:10,185 --> 02:29:16,180
LAURA: Run in, grab the armor, Plane Shift out.
Can they chase us down if we do that?

1669
02:29:16,180 --> 02:29:19,892
MARISHA: Classic B&amp;E? Plane Shift takes a
minute--

1670
02:29:19,892 --> 02:29:21,355
LAURA: No, it's instant. Remember, we checked it.

1671
02:29:21,355 --> 02:29:22,435
MATT: It's an action.

1672
02:29:22,435 --> 02:29:26,130
MARISHA: It takes an action. As long as we're all
in a circle holding hands.

1673
02:29:26,130 --> 02:29:27,383
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

1674
02:29:27,383 --> 02:29:31,096
TALIESIN: And what happens if you can't Plane
Shift out of that house? We probably want to get

1675
02:29:31,096 --> 02:29:32,921
out of the house and then Plane Shift.

1676
02:29:32,921 --> 02:29:34,384
MARISHA: In case it's magically locked down?

1677
02:29:34,384 --> 02:29:35,902
TALIESIN: In case it's magically locked down.

1678
02:29:35,902 --> 02:29:37,007
LAURA: Yeah, that's pretty smart.

1679
02:29:37,007 --> 02:29:40,385
TALIESIN: In which the phrase, "I have many
enchantments upon my home," led me to believe

1680
02:29:40,385 --> 02:29:41,947
there's probably--

1681
02:29:41,947 --> 02:29:46,163
TRAVIS: I mean, I really don't see what the problem
is, right? Hellfiend goes, "Oh, time to go shopping

1682
02:29:46,163 --> 02:29:52,259
for slaves." He walks up to the Arches, we set
a trap, Vax goes stabby-stab-stab, Percy goes

1683
02:29:52,259 --> 02:29:57,379
(gunshot), Pike goes, (high-pitched) "Hi", and like,
donesky!

1684
02:29:57,379 --> 02:30:01,259
TALIESIN: You're writing the best children's book
ever.

1685
02:30:01,259 --> 02:30:05,460
LAURA: I mean, I'm down, I think that's a great
plan, Grog.

1686
02:30:05,460 --> 02:30:08,928
MARISHA: He also said that the pit fiend could be
there in one to two days.

1687
02:30:08,928 --> 02:30:09,967
LAURA: Yes.

1688
02:30:09,967 --> 02:30:11,197
SAM: Could be there tomorrow?

1689
02:30:11,197 --> 02:30:17,530
MARISHA: Also, do we know how much time passes in
the fire plane versus the real world?

1690
02:30:17,530 --> 02:30:22,528
MATT: You're not entirely certain, comparatively
the time. You feel like you've been here for, I

1691
02:30:22,528 --> 02:30:33,890
mean, a while. By the cycle of the sun-like light
source in the sky here on the plane, it seems like

1692
02:30:33,890 --> 02:30:35,898
you've been here for about a day.

1693
02:30:35,898 --> 02:30:37,538
LAURA: Oh, shit.

1694
02:30:37,538 --> 02:30:44,040
MARISHA: Do we remember any type of relative time
jump when we were here last time in and out?

1695
02:30:44,040 --> 02:30:49,960
MATT: No, but you were only here for maybe a
handful of hours last time you guys came here.

1696
02:30:49,960 --> 02:30:52,079
TRAVIS: Were you worried about being away from
Fort Daxio for too long?

1697
02:30:52,079 --> 02:30:55,223
LIAM: Yeah, that's what I was suggesting.

1698
02:30:55,223 --> 02:30:58,138
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean we could come back to
Thordak just destroyed everything.

1699
02:30:58,138 --> 02:30:59,807
TRAVIS: Can't we scry on the fort?

1700
02:30:59,807 --> 02:31:02,820
MARISHA: I can't scry between dimensions.

1701
02:31:02,820 --> 02:31:04,442
MATT: It has to be on the same plane.

1702
02:31:04,442 --> 02:31:06,676
LAURA: Can you scry on the pit fiend?

1703
02:31:06,676 --> 02:31:10,353
MARISHA: Yeah.

1704
02:31:10,353 --> 02:31:12,344
SAM: We know what it looks like.

1705
02:31:12,344 --> 02:31:15,263
LAURA: And you know like a thing for him, right?
We know his name.

1706
02:31:15,263 --> 02:31:17,256
TRAVIS: Thank you, watering boy.

1707
02:31:17,256 --> 02:31:18,464
MARISHA: Yes, I could.

1708
02:31:18,464 --> 02:31:20,489
SAM: Cabin boy, thank you.

1709
02:31:20,489 --> 02:31:24,069
TRAVIS: That's what I meant! That's what I wanted
to say!

1710
02:31:24,069 --> 02:31:32,570
MARISHA: Yeah, can I use the scrying eye to try
and scry on the pit fiend?

1711
02:31:32,570 --> 02:31:38,818
MATT: You certainly can. So you have secondhand
knowledge of the pit fiend.

1712
02:31:38,818 --> 02:31:44,530
MARISHA: And trying to imagine his emblem that
she described with the two manacles and the black

1713
02:31:44,530 --> 02:31:47,631
chain, because that was pretty cool.

1714
02:31:47,631 --> 02:31:53,304
MATT: So, focusing on the emblem that you were
described, you close your eyes and concentrate,

1715
02:31:53,304 --> 02:32:10,278
holding the orb of scrying within your grasp.
Okay. What's your spell DC?

1716
02:32:10,278 --> 02:32:11,794
MARISHA: 19.

1717
02:32:11,794 --> 02:32:13,599
MATT: What's the spell DC of the scrying orb?

1718
02:32:13,599 --> 02:32:16,565
MARISHA: It doesn't say.

1719
02:32:16,565 --> 02:32:21,708
MATT: It would be 15. Unless you cast the spell,
right?

1720
02:32:21,708 --> 02:32:24,505
MARISHA: Yeah, I get to do it, so it should still
be mine, right?

1721
02:32:24,505 --> 02:32:30,049
MATT: Usually it would be set for the item, but
for the purposes of this it won't make a huge

1722
02:32:30,049 --> 02:32:33,264
difference. What's your spell DC?

1723
02:32:33,264 --> 02:32:34,529
MARISHA: 19.

1724
02:32:34,529 --> 02:32:39,284
MATT: 19, okay yeah, so it won't make a
difference. You close your eyes and you see a

1725
02:32:39,284 --> 02:32:45,716
brief fuzzy vision of the city from your
perspective and then your vision jumps suddenly

1726
02:32:45,716 --> 02:32:51,959
and comes to fire, then comes to black, then comes
to a quick view of that weird citadel, carved out

1727
02:32:51,959 --> 02:32:56,877
of black obsidian hands reaching over each other,
the one that you saw earlier, the embassy. Then

1728
02:32:56,877 --> 02:33:03,946
you feel a wall and you're thrust through a series of
walls, not able to really take in any visuals, the

1729
02:33:03,946 --> 02:33:14,485
process is so fast, wall after wall, then you come
to a darkened room, a wide chamber that contains a

1730
02:33:14,485 --> 02:33:22,363
long series of papers and scrolls that are laid
out in a specific format. You can see, chained to

1731
02:33:22,363 --> 02:33:28,988
the walls, individuals moaning and crying. And you
see, sitting in this small circle in the center of

1732
02:33:28,988 --> 02:33:35,518
the floor, a humanoid-- a humanoid in the sense
that it has arms or legs-- but you see the pit fiend

1733
02:33:35,518 --> 02:33:43,300
sitting there, almost meditating, eyes closed, large
teeth, jagged and pointed, coming out of its large

1734
02:33:43,300 --> 02:33:47,379
jaw, dark red horns that curve behind its head,
these large wings that are folded around it from

1735
02:33:47,379 --> 02:33:53,800
the back as it sits its knees out, crosslegged, its
arms resting upon the edges, eyes closed. It

1736
02:33:53,856 --> 02:33:57,877
appears to be sleeping. Or at least resting.

1737
02:33:57,877 --> 02:34:01,862
MARISHA: Can I get a focus on what the slaves look
like?

1738
02:34:01,862 --> 02:34:05,222
MATT: Unfortunately you can't, the target of your
scry is about the most you can focus on; you can

1739
02:34:05,222 --> 02:34:11,847
give a blurry atmosphere around them, you can
barely pick up the aspect of their presence, but

1740
02:34:11,847 --> 02:34:13,720
that's the most you can do with the scry spell.

1741
02:34:13,720 --> 02:34:20,743
MARISHA: Okay. Well, he appears to be in his
bedroom, definitely in the citadel. As she said.

1742
02:34:20,743 --> 02:34:25,212
LAURA: Does he have any, like, cuts on him,
anything that looks weak?

1743
02:34:25,212 --> 02:34:29,575
MARISHA: He had big gnarly teeth and slaves.

1744
02:34:29,575 --> 02:34:31,647
ASHLEY: Did he look scary?

1745
02:34:31,647 --> 02:34:35,307
MARISHA: He looked very unpleasant.

1746
02:34:35,307 --> 02:34:39,544
TRAVIS: But it's just him, right? One dude?

1747
02:34:39,544 --> 02:34:41,023
SAM: We could take one dude!

1748
02:34:41,023 --> 02:34:48,944
MARISHA: Well, he also had a bunch of people
chained to the wall, and this was after my vision

1749
02:34:48,944 --> 02:34:58,224
being slammed through several walls. It seemed to
be very deep in the labyrinth that is the embassy,

1750
02:34:58,224 --> 02:35:01,177
which seems like a labyrinth.

1751
02:35:01,177 --> 02:35:03,420
LAURA: So we'll have to wait until he comes
out.

1752
02:35:03,420 --> 02:35:06,138
TALIESIN: Can we trick him into the mansion?

1753
02:35:06,138 --> 02:35:11,074
SAM: The mansion door, I think, is only ten feet
tall.

1754
02:35:11,074 --> 02:35:12,524
LAURA: How tall is he?

1755
02:35:12,524 --> 02:35:13,860
SAM: 20?

1756
02:35:13,860 --> 02:35:18,902
MATT: Best that you could tell, probably close to
15 feet.

1757
02:35:18,902 --> 02:35:20,919
LAURA: He could duck in.

1758
02:35:20,919 --> 02:35:22,638
MARISHA: He's a little taller than Grog.

1759
02:35:22,638 --> 02:35:25,747
ASHLEY: What kind of slaves did it look like he
had? All types?

1760
02:35:25,747 --> 02:35:31,557
MARISHA: I tried to look. I couldn't tell. Looked
like a nice variety.

1761
02:35:31,557 --> 02:35:36,280
LAURA: If we said, "Hey, I heard there's really good
slaves up in this mansion--"

1762
02:35:36,280 --> 02:35:40,695
SAM: And then what do we do in the mansion?

1763
02:35:40,695 --> 02:35:45,775
TALIESIN: We can quietly attack him from all
sides. Have a fight that won't draw the attention

1764
02:35:45,775 --> 02:35:47,014
of the guards.

1765
02:35:47,014 --> 02:35:50,929
SAM: Something tells me that people fight in this
city a lot.

1766
02:35:50,929 --> 02:35:55,305
LAURA: Yeah, but I don't think the slaves attack
the owners very often.

1767
02:35:55,305 --> 02:36:02,403
TALIESIN: There's nothing we could damage in there
that would remain damaged.

1768
02:36:02,403 --> 02:36:07,815
MARISHA: Unless we tried to use ourselves as slave
bait again, put a few of us on the auction.

1769
02:36:07,815 --> 02:36:14,957
LIAM: You seemed to be able to talk Yenk into
doing whatever you wanted. Do you think you could

1770
02:36:14,957 --> 02:36:16,126
do that with this guy?

1771
02:36:16,126 --> 02:36:18,540
SAM: I could certainly make an appearance of
Yenk.

1772
02:36:18,540 --> 02:36:22,376
LIAM: I meant convince him to come inside.

1773
02:36:22,376 --> 02:36:23,776
SAM: You mean Dominate him?

1774
02:36:23,776 --> 02:36:26,724
LAURA: He could be much more intelligent than Yenk
was, though.

1775
02:36:26,724 --> 02:36:27,816
LIAM: Could be.

1776
02:36:27,816 --> 02:36:30,611
SAM: I can try.

1777
02:36:30,611 --> 02:36:31,954
TALIESIN: He wears jewelry.

1778
02:36:31,954 --> 02:36:33,473
MARISHA: He has a logo.

1779
02:36:33,473 --> 02:36:34,652
TRAVIS: He meditates.

1780
02:36:34,652 --> 02:36:36,402
LAURA: He meditates?

1781
02:36:36,402 --> 02:36:37,582
TRAVIS: Yep.

1782
02:36:37,582 --> 02:36:38,747
TALIESIN: Bikram yoga.

1783
02:36:38,747 --> 02:36:41,478
LAURA: Is that the hot one?

1784
02:36:41,478 --> 02:36:43,189
TALIESIN: That is the hot one.

1785
02:36:43,189 --> 02:36:50,519
TRAVIS: Should we go recon on the auction as slave
shopping or whatever it is?

1786
02:36:50,519 --> 02:36:52,232
LAURA: In the morning. Not now.

1787
02:36:52,232 --> 02:36:56,958
TRAVIS: Set up the door outside of the market or
whatever.

1788
02:36:56,958 --> 02:36:58,642
SAM: So, he's going to the auction to slave shop?

1789
02:36:58,642 --> 02:36:59,876
TALIESIN: Yes.

1790
02:36:59,876 --> 02:37:03,634
TRAVIS: Unique slaves. He likes unique slaves.

1791
02:37:03,634 --> 02:37:10,294
SAM: Seems crazy that a gigantic fucking pit boss,
whatever he is, would be like, "Oh, sure, I'll

1792
02:37:10,294 --> 02:37:13,140
"step into this creepy door, weird stranger!"

1793
02:37:13,140 --> 02:37:16,057
LAURA: The mansion door is rather creepy, isn't
it?

1794
02:37:16,057 --> 02:37:18,444
SAM: Yeah, for sure! Everything about me is
creepy, guys!

1795
02:37:18,444 --> 02:37:24,955
TRAVIS: But it's unique, and what if inside the
door we make it look even more unique?

1796
02:37:24,955 --> 02:37:27,199
LAURA: Yeah, can't you make the mansion look like
anything you want?

1797
02:37:27,199 --> 02:37:30,336
MATT: Within reason.

1798
02:37:30,336 --> 02:37:33,841
TRAVIS: That's important to say.

1799
02:37:33,841 --> 02:37:40,770
MATT: There are limitations. It's still a
mansion.

1800
02:37:40,770 --> 02:37:44,467
LAURA: I mean, if it looks like a sexy den or
something.

1801
02:37:44,467 --> 02:37:46,767
TRAVIS: Yeah, and if he doesn't come in the door,
then we kill him.

1802
02:37:46,767 --> 02:37:57,948
SAM: This seems like a plan C to me. Convincing a
giant killing machine to step into a nice house

1803
02:37:57,948 --> 02:38:03,151
seems like it's a desperate plan of people without
anything at all.

1804
02:38:03,151 --> 02:38:06,620
TALIESIN: He's not a giant killing machine, he's a
businessman looking to purchase--

1805
02:38:06,620 --> 02:38:10,376
TRAVIS: What, do we go and make a deal with the
devil? (goofy chuckle)

1806
02:38:10,376 --> 02:38:17,658
SAM: The deal is we just attack him and kill him!
What's the big deal? We were sent on a killing

1807
02:38:17,658 --> 02:38:19,475
mission here.

1808
02:38:19,475 --> 02:38:21,227
TALIESIN: Where are we going to kill him?

1809
02:38:21,227 --> 02:38:27,975
SAM: Wherever we see him! Let's talk to Sonny
here, creepy Sonny.

1810
02:38:27,975 --> 02:38:36,154
LIAM: What about this? This is a terrible idea.
Could one of us goad him into following us out of

1811
02:38:36,154 --> 02:38:42,258
his abode or some building, somewhere, and you
plop the mansion door outside the actual door? So

1812
02:38:42,258 --> 02:38:46,328
he goes to try to leave the tavern or whatever the
fuck, he goes into our house?

1813
02:38:46,328 --> 02:38:52,016
LAURA: Ultimately, if we can get him in a building
and then back out of the building, great. But if

1814
02:38:52,016 --> 02:38:54,612
we can get him in that building, why can't we get
him in the fucking mansion?

1815
02:38:54,612 --> 02:39:00,571
MATT: As far as you understand, for a person to
walk into the mansion, they have to know they're

1816
02:39:00,571 --> 02:39:01,797
walking into the mansion.

1817
02:39:01,797 --> 02:39:10,399
SAM: So we can definitely entice them. You guys
can pose as slaves and show him some amazing feats

1818
02:39:10,399 --> 02:39:14,740
and say, "There's more where that came from,
inside the mansion!" but if he says no, then

1819
02:39:14,740 --> 02:39:15,916
what's our plan?

1820
02:39:15,916 --> 02:39:20,325
MATT: Senokir pipes up at this point. He's been
listening in to this whole conversation off to the

1821
02:39:20,325 --> 02:39:32,502
side. He goes, "If you are indeed going to fight a
creature of this esteem, I will request to not be

1822
02:39:32,502 --> 02:39:43,539
"present. Thus, you will be masterless in this
city. I don't know how to protect you the way you look."

1823
02:39:43,539 --> 02:39:47,724
TRAVIS: Don't we have the neck rings, the collars,
to mock that we're--

1824
02:39:47,724 --> 02:39:55,476
MATT: "Perhaps. That will be helpful. Just make
sure you have a solid story, or another way

1825
02:39:55,476 --> 02:39:57,147
"of masking yourself. Otherwise--"

1826
02:39:57,147 --> 02:40:01,618
SAM: I can make us all look different. What would
make us passable in the city?

1827
02:40:01,618 --> 02:40:13,055
MATT: "Well, dressed more like us, or the others
who are free. It all depends on what you can look like."

1828
02:40:13,055 --> 02:40:15,833
TRAVIS: Less appealing. Less different.

1829
02:40:15,833 --> 02:40:21,812
MATT: "Or, at least, amongst the elite of this
city, where you won't be bothered."

1830
02:40:21,812 --> 02:40:26,216
SAM: I can make us all robes and stuff.

1831
02:40:26,216 --> 02:40:28,992
ASHELY: Don't we want to look unique for him to
want--

1832
02:40:28,992 --> 02:40:31,345
LAURA: One of us.

1833
02:40:31,345 --> 02:40:33,953
MARISHA: Seeming allows you to tailor us, right?

1834
02:40:33,953 --> 02:40:35,146
SAM: Sure, sure.

1835
02:40:35,146 --> 02:40:37,286
MATT: Actually, what does Seeming allow?

1836
02:40:37,286 --> 02:40:44,870
SAM: I can shrink or grow us by a foot, change our
general appearance and clothing.

1837
02:40:44,870 --> 02:40:52,484
MARISHA: How about we do a little bit of both? We
can have a few of us, maybe two, as slaves, the

1838
02:40:52,484 --> 02:41:01,595
rest as masters, walking around incognito. Once one
of us gets sold off, we track him back so we're

1839
02:41:01,595 --> 02:41:07,053
not fighting a member of the Embassy of the City
of Brass in the middle of the market.

1840
02:41:07,053 --> 02:41:08,227
LAURA: That would be bad.

1841
02:41:08,227 --> 02:41:16,951
LIAM: I like the mansion idea. What if we pitched
the mansion as a traveling magical boutique slave

1842
02:41:16,951 --> 02:41:26,626
shop? Artisan slave shop? We lube this guy up in a
loincloth and this guy after a hard day's

1843
02:41:26,626 --> 02:41:35,102
tinkering, and we sell them! This guy can sell
anything! This guy could sell a hunk of shit to

1844
02:41:35,102 --> 02:41:36,331
the Emperor of Emon.

1845
02:41:36,331 --> 02:41:39,877
MARISHA: These people have seen a lot of shit, not
just one hunk of shit.

1846
02:41:39,877 --> 02:41:43,908
LAURA: What if you and I dressed in exact,
identical clothing, and then we're unique? We're,

1847
02:41:43,908 --> 02:41:45,429
you know, twin slaves?

1848
02:41:45,429 --> 02:41:50,173
TALIESIN: I was actually going to say quintuplets.
We could all look the same.

1849
02:41:50,173 --> 02:41:53,473
MARISHA: Is that a fantasy that people have?

1850
02:41:53,473 --> 02:41:54,739
TALIESIN: It is now.

1851
02:41:54,739 --> 02:41:56,518
LIAM: That's the plan!

1852
02:41:56,518 --> 02:42:00,189
SAM: I'm sorry, what's going on? We're all looking
like you?

1853
02:42:00,189 --> 02:42:06,086
LIAM: We're septuplets! Sextuplets! And you're the
salesman.

1854
02:42:06,086 --> 02:42:15,711
SAM: I'm selling a group of identical sextuplet
slaves and the advantage is just that they look

1855
02:42:15,711 --> 02:42:20,473
cool? "Check out my slaves; they all look alike!"

1856
02:42:20,473 --> 02:42:24,097
TRAVIS: If you give us one order, we all
understand the order!

1857
02:42:24,097 --> 02:42:29,073
TALIESIN: Somehow, a stamp with an upside-down
airplane is worth a fortune. This, obviously, is

1858
02:42:29,073 --> 02:42:30,160
more rare.

1859
02:42:30,160 --> 02:42:33,661
SAM: I could make you all other ways unique.

1860
02:42:33,661 --> 02:42:39,847
LIAM: I mean, we're fairly attractive! I feel like
six of us would be worth the price of admission.

1861
02:42:39,847 --> 02:42:43,380
LAURA: Although you can only grow us or shrink us
by a foot, so this would be a really little--

1862
02:42:43,380 --> 02:42:45,348
TALIESIN: We'll make her taller and you two
shorter.

1863
02:42:45,348 --> 02:42:49,897
MARISHA: Can I also throw out that maybe six might
be pushing it a little? Maybe we should drop it

1864
02:42:49,897 --> 02:42:51,990
down to, like, quadruplets?

1865
02:42:51,990 --> 02:42:59,061
TALIESIN: No! Because six is what he's walking
around with! He's got more back in his shop!

1866
02:42:59,061 --> 02:43:06,004
LIAM: It's got the word "sex" right in it!
Sextuplets! Sex sells! Sextuplets sell!

1867
02:43:06,004 --> 02:43:07,828
TRAVIS: You can do it. Magic door, sextuplets.

1868
02:43:07,828 --> 02:43:16,311
SAM: I love this idea, don't get me wrong, but I
feel like convincing him that you are able-bodied

1869
02:43:16,311 --> 02:43:22,501
slaves with magical abilities might be even more
of icing on the cake than, "Hey, they look alike!"

1870
02:43:22,501 --> 02:43:27,297
TRAVIS: I like that! You vamp, baby, you do
whatever. Do what you do.

1871
02:43:27,297 --> 02:43:36,867
SAM; All right, and when it doesn't work, Sonny,
can we fight him right there in the Arches? Will

1872
02:43:36,867 --> 02:43:39,618
people be like, "What the fuck's going on? Arrest
them all!"

1873
02:43:39,618 --> 02:43:47,392
MATT: "He is a known entity in this city. If you
wish to fight him in the open, I would recommend

1874
02:43:47,392 --> 02:43:56,133
"having a way of perhaps having the Illuminated on
your side."

1875
02:43:56,133 --> 02:43:57,761
SAM: That's the guards?

1876
02:43:57,761 --> 02:43:59,269
MATT: "That is the guard."

1877
02:43:59,269 --> 02:44:06,117
LIAM: Artisanal half-elf slaves.

1878
02:44:06,117 --> 02:44:12,490
LAURA: Wait. If we can convince them that he's
broken a law of some sort--

1879
02:44:12,490 --> 02:44:16,629
TRAVIS and LAURA: Bribes.

1880
02:44:16,629 --> 02:44:23,045
SAM: We could also try to convince them that he's
broken a law or done something horrible.

1881
02:44:23,045 --> 02:44:25,039
LAURA: What's against the law here?

1882
02:44:25,039 --> 02:44:39,677
MATT: "Well, going against the sultan is the most
grievous of things. He is a paranoid one."

1883
02:44:39,677 --> 02:44:43,825
LAURA: He's the one in the big-- no.

1884
02:44:43,825 --> 02:44:47,485
MATT: "In the Charcoal Palace."

1885
02:44:47,485 --> 02:44:57,802
SAM: I could make the image of our mark standing
out there in the middle of the Arches, cursing the

1886
02:44:57,802 --> 02:45:00,675
sultan's name and pissing all over the place.

1887
02:45:00,675 --> 02:45:05,454
TRAVIS: Right, but listen, I don't know if we have
enough to bribe all the efreet. What if we went to

1888
02:45:05,454 --> 02:45:16,976
the Charcoal Palace, spewed a tale, and said that
this pit fiend is plotting to overthrow the

1889
02:45:16,976 --> 02:45:20,872
Charcoal Palace and all we want is to remove the
problem for him?

1890
02:45:20,872 --> 02:45:25,876
MATT: "I can really recommend you not go near that
palace."

1891
02:45:25,876 --> 02:45:28,220
LAURA: Yeah, let's not do that.

1892
02:45:28,220 --> 02:45:29,473
TRAVIS: So, we do it.

1893
02:45:29,473 --> 02:45:30,561
LAURA: No, let's not.

1894
02:45:30,561 --> 02:45:38,309
MATT: "They have wards to pierce through lies. You
will find yourselves never heard from again, if

1895
02:45:38,309 --> 02:45:41,399
"you have falsehood in your midst."

1896
02:45:41,399 --> 02:45:45,495
TALIESIN: Does the sultan mark his slaves?

1897
02:45:45,495 --> 02:45:53,748
MATT: "The sultan, I imagine, would, though I am
not aware of it myself."

1898
02:45:53,748 --> 02:45:56,238
TALIESIN: Does he have a seal?

1899
02:45:56,238 --> 02:46:00,601
MATT: "I believe so."

1900
02:46:00,601 --> 02:46:07,647
TALIESIN: If we were to sell ourselves as slaves,
we could be marked as the property of the sultan.

1901
02:46:07,647 --> 02:46:10,143
SAM: And then what?

1902
02:46:10,143 --> 02:46:15,056
TALIESIN: And then we could claim that he was
trying to steal property of the sultan.

1903
02:46:15,056 --> 02:46:20,821
SAM: Are we still sextuplets in this scenario?

1904
02:46:20,821 --> 02:46:27,904
TALIESIN: You don't get to negotiate that aspect.
Even if we're just sneaking back into the house

1905
02:46:27,904 --> 02:46:33,682
and stealing the armor, we're doing it as
identical sextuplets. There's no fighting that

1906
02:46:33,682 --> 02:46:35,234
anymore.

1907
02:46:35,234 --> 02:46:37,670
LIAM: One addendum. Our sizes don't change,
right?

1908
02:46:37,670 --> 02:46:39,279
SAM: I can make you a foot taller or smaller.

1909
02:46:39,279 --> 02:46:49,498
LIAM: We could be the Matryoshka nesting dolls.
From biggest to smallest. That's unique!

1910
02:46:49,498 --> 02:46:51,246
SAM: That <i>is</i> unique.

1911
02:46:51,246 --> 02:46:59,436
MARISHA: I feel like we're spending a lot of time
on this, and maybe not enough time on our battle plan.

1912
02:46:59,436 --> 02:47:02,276
LIAM: Oh, that would go to shit anyway.

1913
02:47:02,276 --> 02:47:09,521
SAM: Okay, so far, let's recap. Recap, vote, and
move on.

1914
02:47:09,521 --> 02:47:13,877
LAURA: Senokir, if you saw a bunch of people who
looked the same, that went from small to big,

1915
02:47:13,877 --> 02:47:16,503
wouldn't you want them as slaves?

1916
02:47:16,503 --> 02:47:18,376
MATT: "Depending."

1917
02:47:18,376 --> 02:47:20,768
LAURA: They were totally hot, too.

1918
02:47:20,768 --> 02:47:22,530
MATT: "Probably."

1919
02:47:22,530 --> 02:47:26,810
ASHLEY: And also, if they had skills, each of them
had a separate skill?

1920
02:47:26,810 --> 02:47:32,521
MATT: "Most likely. There are many unique slaves
that pass through the Arches."

1921
02:47:32,521 --> 02:47:35,806
LAURA: Oh, really? What's the most unique one
you've ever seen?

1922
02:47:35,806 --> 02:47:44,669
MATT: "They've had a few celestials through
before. Those generally fetch a pretty penny with

1923
02:47:44,669 --> 02:47:54,379
"the individuals you're speaking about. The winged
ones, they apparently are very sought-after by the

1924
02:47:54,379 --> 02:47:56,539
"Nine Hells."

1925
02:47:56,539 --> 02:48:01,069
LAURA: Wings! You have wings!

1926
02:48:01,069 --> 02:48:02,915
MARISHA: Or we could Seeming wings?

1927
02:48:02,915 --> 02:48:05,603
LAURA: Yeah, but they could probably see through
that shit! His are real!

1928
02:48:05,603 --> 02:48:09,714
LIAM: So far, only Cinnabons here has been able to
see through my shit.

1929
02:48:09,714 --> 02:48:15,361
LAURA: I feel like they'd be able to tell. But
whatever.

1930
02:48:15,361 --> 02:48:20,777
TALIESIN: If each of the sextuplets-- I'm never
going to get tired of saying that-- were unique in

1931
02:48:20,777 --> 02:48:25,025
their own way, and yours was that you had a trace
of celestial which is why you have wings?

1932
02:48:25,025 --> 02:48:28,014
TRAVIS: Do we still want to try and get him in the
mansion?

1933
02:48:28,014 --> 02:48:29,181
TALIESIN: Yes.

1934
02:48:29,181 --> 02:48:34,717
SAM: So wait, I'm going to recap these plans,
here. Plan A, making us all sextuplets and trying

1935
02:48:34,717 --> 02:48:36,080
to get him into the mansion.

1936
02:48:36,080 --> 02:48:37,582
TRAVIS: Celestial sextuplets.

1937
02:48:37,582 --> 02:48:42,533
SAM: Plan B, we're all sextuplets--

1938
02:48:42,533 --> 02:48:49,401
MATT: Seeming does not add wings. It has
the same arrangement of body parts. But if one of

1939
02:48:49,401 --> 02:48:52,191
them has wings, you could change those wings into
a different color.

1940
02:48:52,191 --> 02:49:04,420
MARISHA: Can I use Alter Self, because Alter Self
gives-- because I can give myself gills and stuff

1941
02:49:04,420 --> 02:49:05,232
like that.

1942
02:49:05,232 --> 02:49:10,760
SAM: So, Plan A, again, sextuplets, slaves,
mansion. Plan B, we're still sextuplets, but this

1943
02:49:10,760 --> 02:49:18,273
time, we're somehow framing him for dishonoring
the sultan and then attacking him in the middle of

1944
02:49:18,273 --> 02:49:19,239
the square.

1945
02:49:19,239 --> 02:49:21,107
TALIESIN: Which is why Plan A is much better.

1946
02:49:21,107 --> 02:49:27,306
SAM: Plan C, still sextuplets, that doesn't
change, but now we're just ambushing him in the

1947
02:49:27,306 --> 02:49:30,972
center of the Arches and we've paid off the guards
to turn a blind eye.

1948
02:49:30,972 --> 02:49:33,130
TALIESIN: We don't have enough money to pay off
the guards.

1949
02:49:33,130 --> 02:49:34,279
SAM: We have tons of money!

1950
02:49:34,279 --> 02:49:35,631
LAURA: We don't have <i>that</i> much money.

1951
02:49:35,631 --> 02:49:44,854
SAM: I mean, we could bribe them with six
identical slaves. So what's it going to be? Plan

1952
02:49:44,854 --> 02:49:52,242
A, the mansion that's certainly going to fail?
Plan B, the framing job? Or Plan C, the bribery

1953
02:49:52,242 --> 02:49:53,743
slash ambush?

1954
02:49:53,743 --> 02:49:56,719
LAURA: Plan A, into plan B if it doesn't work!

1955
02:49:56,719 --> 02:49:57,729
SAM: All right, great!

1956
02:49:57,729 --> 02:50:03,077
TALIESIN: Remember, we're just to show off. You've
got more.

1957
02:50:03,077 --> 02:50:05,329
SAM: Of course I've got more.

1958
02:50:05,329 --> 02:50:07,026
LAURA: What is the sultan's name?

1959
02:50:07,026 --> 02:50:16,942
MATT: "The sultan's name is the Grand Sultan of
the Efreet, the Lord of Flame, the Potentate

1960
02:50:16,942 --> 02:50:23,083
"Incandescent, the Tempering and Eternal Flame of
Truth, the Most Puissant of Hunters, Marshal of

1961
02:50:23,083 --> 02:50:29,467
"the Order of the Fiery Heart, the Smoldering
Dictator, the Crimson Firebrand, Marrake al-Sidan

1962
02:50:29,467 --> 02:50:31,325
"al-Hariq ben Lazen."

1963
02:50:31,325 --> 02:50:37,229
MARISHA: It's like when you start the little
Halloween sing-y things.

1964
02:50:37,229 --> 02:50:39,519
LAURA: I almost got it memorized though.

1965
02:50:39,519 --> 02:50:41,235
TRAVIS: I thought Percy's was long, shit.

1966
02:50:41,235 --> 02:50:43,043
TALIESIN: Mine's better.

1967
02:50:43,043 --> 02:50:48,644
LIAM: Scan-Man, can you rearrange the inside of
the mansion to look like whatever you want--

1968
02:50:48,644 --> 02:50:50,852
SAM: Yeah, what would it be? A slave auction
house?

1969
02:50:50,852 --> 02:50:58,287
LIAM: Could it be a theater for presentation, or a
ring to show off amazing skills? Wings, arrows?

1970
02:50:58,287 --> 02:51:03,282
SAM: A circus side-show thing?

1971
02:51:03,282 --> 02:51:05,724
TALIESIN: Somewhere between the Folies Bergere and
Caligula's living room.

1972
02:51:05,724 --> 02:51:07,522
SAM: Caligula's living room, I can do.

1973
02:51:07,522 --> 02:51:16,408
MARISHA: Maybe have a little side area with hookah
and some nice dancers, you know? As he watches, to

1974
02:51:16,408 --> 02:51:18,060
add to the atmosphere?

1975
02:51:18,060 --> 02:51:24,368
SAM: I mean, sure, I can do some of these things.
Within reason. Right?

1976
02:51:24,368 --> 02:51:27,540
MATT: Maybe.

1977
02:51:27,540 --> 02:51:33,194
SAM: Once the mansion is built, does it stay
built? It rebuilds every time?

1978
02:51:33,194 --> 02:51:37,367
TALIESIN: I think it's like a Windows PC. You can
change the desktop settings.

1979
02:51:37,367 --> 02:51:44,048
MARISHA: What if the ladies went on a redecorating
tear really fast?

1980
02:51:44,048 --> 02:51:48,335
LAURA: They hung a bunch of fabric up and lit some
candles?

1981
02:51:48,335 --> 02:51:50,879
MARISHA: Dim the lights.

1982
02:51:50,879 --> 02:52:01,413
MATT: It's still a mansion. You have an indoor
foyer. You can customize any other floor plan you

1983
02:52:01,413 --> 02:52:04,599
like, and the decor of it, but it still looks like
a mansion.

1984
02:52:04,599 --> 02:52:09,027
LAURA: So we can put pieces of fabric up.

1985
02:52:09,027 --> 02:52:12,190
ASHLEY: Opium den style.

1986
02:52:12,190 --> 02:52:14,878
LIAM: Can we build a stage out of chickens?

1987
02:52:14,878 --> 02:52:18,231
TALIESIN: You could have little slave chickens.

1988
02:52:18,231 --> 02:52:29,429
SAM: I mean, that sounds so great. I'm on board.
Let's try this stupid, crazy plan. So, we're going

1989
02:52:29,429 --> 02:52:35,047
to go to the Arches tomorrow, disguised as the
slaves of what's-her-butt?

1990
02:52:35,047 --> 02:52:38,075
LAURA: Juuraiel?

1991
02:52:38,075 --> 02:52:45,312
TALIESIN: You've already made a sale, and you have
more back at the--

1992
02:52:45,312 --> 02:52:51,566
SAM: Sure. So, you're slaves, I'm a slave-master.
What do I look like?

1993
02:52:51,566 --> 02:52:53,100
LAURA: Whatever you want to look like.

1994
02:52:53,100 --> 02:52:56,976
SAM: No, I've got to look like a slave-master.
Senny, what would I look like?

1995
02:52:56,976 --> 02:53:02,792
MATT: "I would recommend not being a pink-skinned
gnome like yourself. Perhaps something that could

1996
02:53:02,792 --> 02:53:05,437
"live in this city."

1997
02:53:05,437 --> 02:53:06,758
LAURA: Like maybe an imp!

1998
02:53:06,758 --> 02:53:09,472
MATT: "An imp would be interesting."

1999
02:53:09,472 --> 02:53:12,586
SAM: An imp with jewelry and such?

2000
02:53:12,586 --> 02:53:18,170
MATT: "However, an imp would not be solo and would
probably still be behooven to the Nine Hells, and

2001
02:53:18,170 --> 02:53:23,516
"would work and be considered a subordinate to a
pit fiend. I would not recommend an imp."

2002
02:53:23,516 --> 02:53:26,428
SAM: Give me a thing.

2003
02:53:26,428 --> 02:53:27,794
LAURA: Something little.

2004
02:53:27,794 --> 02:53:34,690
MATT: "Perhaps an azer."

2005
02:53:34,690 --> 02:53:38,877
LAURA: What is that?

2006
02:53:38,877 --> 02:53:49,270
MATT: "Well, as you would consider, close to
them-- a dwarf. You may have seen a few." You've

2007
02:53:49,270 --> 02:53:54,234
seen a couple of strange individuals throughout
the city as you've walked by. They're dwarf-like,

2008
02:53:54,234 --> 02:53:59,938
they're thick, they're muscular. They look like a
dwarf, except for instead of hair and a beard,

2009
02:53:59,938 --> 02:54:07,660
it's fire. A wreath of fire across dark grey,
almost obsidian skin.

2010
02:54:07,660 --> 02:54:09,212
TALIESIN: Baby Ghost Rider.

2011
02:54:09,212 --> 02:54:12,925
LAURA: Awesome! Be one of those!

2012
02:54:12,925 --> 02:54:18,702
MATT: To give you a specific visual, to give you a
feel for what I'm talking about here, when I say--

2013
02:54:18,702 --> 02:54:23,747
TALIESIN: That's baby Ghost Rider!

2014
02:54:23,747 --> 02:54:26,723
LAURA: That is awesome!

2015
02:54:26,723 --> 02:54:29,925
SAM: I'm in.

2016
02:54:29,925 --> 02:54:32,188
LIAM: (high-pitched) Flames!

2017
02:54:32,188 --> 02:54:37,823
LIAM, TALIESIN, and MATT: (high-pitched) Flames on
the side of my face! Heaving, heaving breaths.

2018
02:54:37,823 --> 02:54:43,256
SAM: I'll make a mansion for the night. We'll all
take a rest and then go tomorrow.

2019
02:54:43,256 --> 02:54:45,622
MATT: "I was going to make some beds. We have--"

2020
02:54:45,622 --> 02:54:54,017
LAURA: Oh, that's so kind of you! But we have beds
that are specific to us, and we--

2021
02:54:54,017 --> 02:54:59,927
TALIESIN: Just the break from the heat is the only
thing that would force us to deny your

2022
02:54:59,927 --> 02:55:01,271
hospitality.

2023
02:55:01,271 --> 02:55:02,360
MATT: "Very well."

2024
02:55:02,360 --> 02:55:05,583
TALIESIN: But we will keep the door to our rooms,
of course, in your abode.

2025
02:55:05,583 --> 02:55:12,670
MATT: "Of course. We'll discuss soon our
arrangement. Good night."

2026
02:55:12,670 --> 02:55:16,172
TALIESIN: Why does he keep doing that?!

2027
02:55:16,172 --> 02:55:23,897
ASHLEY: Should one of us sleep in his house?

2028
02:55:23,897 --> 02:55:25,656
LAURA: No, nobody should!

2029
02:55:25,656 --> 02:55:29,975
TALIESIN: There's something wrong in it. There's
something in the basement.

2030
02:55:29,975 --> 02:55:34,313
TRAVIS: I have a quick request. Before I go to
sleep, can I try and find Pike and see if she will

2031
02:55:34,313 --> 02:55:38,007
teach me the alphabet, before my fox's cunning
wears off?

2032
02:55:38,007 --> 02:55:43,094
TALIESIN: That's the saddest thing I've ever
heard.

2033
02:55:43,094 --> 02:55:50,790
MATT: You go and find Pike in her room. She comes
to the door, already groggy, no pun intended.

2034
02:55:50,790 --> 02:56:02,611
Sorry about that. You open your door and you see
Grog standing there, looking a little sheepish.

2035
02:56:02,611 --> 02:56:05,219
ASHLEY: Grog, what's wrong?

2036
02:56:05,219 --> 02:56:14,525
TRAVIS: Yeah, look, I had trouble sleeping, and I
actually know Giant, but I can't read it. Do you

2037
02:56:14,525 --> 02:56:22,371
think maybe, before this fancy smart-potion wears
off, you could teach me some letters?

2038
02:56:22,371 --> 02:56:29,611
ASHLEY: Well, if we have a book or something, I
could. A Beginning to Read Giant, is there

2039
02:56:29,611 --> 02:56:31,968
anything like that where I could know what the
letters are?

2040
02:56:31,968 --> 02:56:35,162
TRAVIS: Well no, I don't see a lot of Giant, just
even Common or--

2041
02:56:35,162 --> 02:56:45,988
ASHLEY: Just Common letters? Yes, I can show you
the alphabet. I'll write it out. Okay? Do you know

2042
02:56:45,988 --> 02:56:55,690
how to spell your name? Okay. It's very easy. You
have four letters in your name, but there are two

2043
02:56:55,690 --> 02:56:58,788
of the same letter. So you really only have three
letters in your name.

2044
02:56:58,788 --> 02:57:01,405
TRAVIS: How many-- I'm not so hot on the numbers,
either.

2045
02:57:01,405 --> 02:57:10,826
ASHLEY: Okay, well, we won't talk about numbers.
Okay, what's the first letter of the alphabet?

2046
02:57:10,826 --> 02:57:11,885
This you know.

2047
02:57:11,885 --> 02:57:12,815
TRAVIS: G.

2048
02:57:12,815 --> 02:57:14,277
ASHLEY: That's the first letter of your name.

2049
02:57:14,277 --> 02:57:15,260
TRAVIS: Oh, it is!

2050
02:57:15,260 --> 02:57:20,112
ASHLEY: Yes, but that's not the first letter of
the alphabet. You've said it before. Ah--

2051
02:57:20,112 --> 02:57:24,793
TRAVIS: Ah-- I. Hey!

2052
02:57:24,793 --> 02:57:36,848
ASHLEY: Oh! It's the first letter, well, you wouldn't 
know that, because you don't know how to spell.

2053
02:57:36,848 --> 02:57:39,274
TRAVIS: Fucking A, this is tough.

2054
02:57:39,274 --> 02:57:41,155
ASHLEY: Oh! You said it!

2055
02:57:41,155 --> 02:57:43,051
TRAVIS: Fucking? A?

2056
02:57:43,051 --> 02:57:46,426
ASHLEY: A! A is the first letter of the alphabet.

2057
02:57:46,426 --> 02:57:51,410
TRAVIS: A. Ay. A. A.

2058
02:57:51,410 --> 02:57:54,929
ASHLEY: And we can keep going--

2059
02:57:54,929 --> 02:58:01,267
(laughter)

2060
02:58:01,267 --> 02:58:09,666
MATT: Okay, for the purposes of the narrative, you
spend the next few hours with Pike in your room,

2061
02:58:09,666 --> 02:58:19,228
beginning to learn elements of the alphabet of
Common. You go through enough of it where you pick

2062
02:58:19,228 --> 02:58:26,258
up some of it and as the potion fades, so does the
memory of the last three hours.

2063
02:58:26,258 --> 02:58:28,945
(yelling)

2064
02:58:28,945 --> 02:58:32,661
MARISHA: That's so mean!

2065
02:58:32,661 --> 02:58:40,451
MATT: This is Flowers for Grogernon. But it
wouldn't have mattered because the Common alphabet

2066
02:58:40,451 --> 02:58:43,613
and Giant runics are totally different things.

2067
02:58:43,613 --> 02:58:45,942
TRAVIS: Yeah, totally. I just wanted to know
something.

2068
02:58:45,942 --> 02:58:51,272
ASHLEY: Did I at least teach him how to spell his
name?

2069
02:58:51,272 --> 02:58:54,761
MATT: Make an intelligence check, Grog.

2070
02:58:54,761 --> 02:58:58,918
TRAVIS: Do I still-- no, it wore off, right? I
don't have advantage.

2071
02:58:58,918 --> 02:59:02,249
LAURA: You can do it, Grog! Roll a natural 20!

2072
02:59:02,249 --> 02:59:05,261
MATT: I'll say, as you feel the potion fading from
you--

2073
02:59:05,261 --> 02:59:06,873
TRAVIS: I burp, and I get a little bubble?

2074
02:59:06,873 --> 02:59:08,902
MATT: Sure. Go ahead and roll an intelligence
check.

2075
02:59:08,902 --> 02:59:20,154
TRAVIS: Oh, that's even worse. Aw, minus two,
fuck! Twelve.

2076
02:59:20,154 --> 02:59:30,644
MATT: You get "Gr--" and that's where it ends.

2077
02:59:30,644 --> 02:59:39,828
TRAVIS: My cursive is sweet. I'm so tired. You
know, I've learned all of these but I'm really

2078
02:59:39,828 --> 02:59:41,146
sleepy.

2079
02:59:41,146 --> 02:59:42,512
ASHLEY: We'll keep working on it.

2080
02:59:42,512 --> 02:59:48,501
TRAVIS: I'm not sure we will. But yeah, keep
working. Good night. Thank you, Pike.

2081
02:59:48,501 --> 02:59:49,943
ASHLEY: You sleep so well, okay?

2082
02:59:49,943 --> 02:59:55,004
LIAM: Smash cut to a year later where he's going,
"See. Kevdak. Run."

2083
02:59:55,004 --> 02:59:59,750
ASHLEY: No! That's so cute!

2084
02:59:59,750 --> 03:00:07,323
Before I go to sleep, I am going to cast
Lesser Restoration on myself, to maybe get rid of

2085
03:00:07,323 --> 03:00:08,673
one point of exhaustion.

2086
03:00:08,673 --> 03:00:09,834
MATT: Okay.

2087
03:00:09,834 --> 03:00:15,369
TALIESIN: Out of curiosity, sleeping outside of
the effects of the heat should make--

2088
03:00:15,369 --> 03:00:18,000
MATT: That'd the Greater Restoration, technically,
to try and--

2089
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:20,020
LIAM: There's AC in here, isn't there?

2090
03:00:20,020 --> 03:00:22,753
TALIESIN: There's AC.

2091
03:00:22,753 --> 03:00:25,100
LAURA: In the mansion. Not in the studio.

2092
03:00:25,100 --> 03:00:29,096
(laughter)

2093
03:00:29,096 --> 03:00:32,303
MATT: Greater Restoration reduces exhaustion. But
you can do that as well.

2094
03:00:32,303 --> 03:00:33,784
ASHLEY: I'll cast Greater Restoration before bed.

2095
03:00:33,784 --> 03:00:35,579
MATT: Okay. So you reduce a level of exhaustion.

2096
03:00:35,579 --> 03:00:41,511
TALIESIN: I am going to send a little time working
on a couple things for the fort when we get back.

2097
03:00:41,511 --> 03:00:52,734
Netting ammo for the trebuchet, just a sketch. To
start to design a very simple bolo for the

2098
03:00:52,734 --> 03:00:53,732
trebuchet.

2099
03:00:53,732 --> 03:00:56,423
MATT: Okay. Just designing?

2100
03:00:56,423 --> 03:01:02,794
TALIESIN: Just penciling and then penciling-- I've
got a notion for a watch tower that's super super

2101
03:01:02,794 --> 03:01:08,391
simple. Platform for two people, tops, with a rope
that connects to a bell so when you start heading

2102
03:01:08,391 --> 03:01:10,218
down it, it goes (high voice) Fuck!

2103
03:01:10,218 --> 03:01:16,240
MATT: Great. All right. So, as you guys all come
to consciousness the next day, you gather your

2104
03:01:16,240 --> 03:01:21,292
things and you step out of the mansion into the
center of Senokir's shop.

2105
03:01:21,292 --> 03:01:23,972
MARISHA: Do we recover our point of exhaustion
when we sleep?

2106
03:01:23,972 --> 03:01:28,260
MATT: With the long rest, you recover a point of
exhaustion, so you'll all back to baseline,

2107
03:01:28,260 --> 03:01:34,057
including you, Pike, because your Greater
Restoration. Your spells are recovered, HP is

2108
03:01:34,057 --> 03:01:39,022
recovered, if there was any loss of it. So, the
day is yours, what do you wish to do?

2109
03:01:39,022 --> 03:01:43,665
SAM: Go to The Arches. The golden arches. Wait,
first we've got to cast Seeming.

2110
03:01:43,665 --> 03:01:48,231
MARISHA: Are we going to scout-- I guess we still
need Seeming.

2111
03:01:48,231 --> 03:01:50,367
ASHLEY: So we're all going to look like Vax?

2112
03:01:50,367 --> 03:01:51,691
LAURA: And Vex.

2113
03:01:51,691 --> 03:01:53,496
ASHLEY: And Vex. All the girls are going to look
like Vex.

2114
03:01:53,496 --> 03:01:55,396
LIAM: Three Vex's, I mean, it's kind of the same.

2115
03:01:55,396 --> 03:01:57,874
LAURA: I mean, yeah, but one's got boobs.

2116
03:01:57,874 --> 03:01:59,112
LIAM: Which one?

2117
03:01:59,112 --> 03:02:00,374
LAURA: Which one?

2118
03:02:00,374 --> 03:02:03,974
(laughter)

2119
03:02:03,974 --> 03:02:09,990
SAM: We're going, right? All right. So, yes, I'll
cast Seeming on everyone. Making them various

2120
03:02:09,990 --> 03:02:15,109
level heights of Vex and Vax, I guess.

2121
03:02:15,109 --> 03:02:16,980
(laughter)

2122
03:02:16,980 --> 03:02:19,208
LAURA: (shouting) This is awesome.

2123
03:02:19,208 --> 03:02:23,750
SAM: And they're slaves, right? They're slaves.
Tattered clothing.

2124
03:02:23,750 --> 03:02:26,879
LAURA: No. No, make us look like good slaves.

2125
03:02:26,879 --> 03:02:28,153
TALIESIN: Simple white robes.

2126
03:02:28,153 --> 03:02:31,834
SAM: All right. Simple tattered white robes.

2127
03:02:31,834 --> 03:02:33,241
(laughter)

2128
03:02:33,241 --> 03:02:34,400
LAURA: No, I want to look pretty.

2129
03:02:34,400 --> 03:02:35,873
ASHLEY: You're so rich, you want us clean.

2130
03:02:35,873 --> 03:02:37,683
LAURA: Make us clean, like pretty slaves.

2131
03:02:37,683 --> 03:02:42,779
SAM: You're clean. That's right. You're the best
of the best. You would have the best robes. Right?

2132
03:02:42,779 --> 03:02:44,233
ASHLEY: Like Princess Leia, Jabba the Hut.

2133
03:02:44,233 --> 03:02:46,512
SAM: Totally right. The best, finest simple
white.

2134
03:02:46,512 --> 03:02:48,230
TRAVIS: And we still have the neck thing.

2135
03:02:48,230 --> 03:02:51,501
SAM: Absolutely. And wait, am I making him
celestial-ish?

2136
03:02:51,501 --> 03:02:55,320
LAURA: Oh yeah, make his wings, when they come
out, like white wings.

2137
03:02:55,320 --> 03:02:58,168
SAM: Is that a celestial? What does a celestial
look like? Do they glow all the time?

2138
03:02:58,168 --> 03:02:59,648
TALIESIN: They have white wings, correct?

2139
03:02:59,648 --> 03:03:01,957
MATT: Most angelic entities have white or gold
wings.

2140
03:03:01,957 --> 03:03:05,855
MARISHA: Did we find out if I could Alter Self
wings?

2141
03:03:05,855 --> 03:03:08,612
MATT: You could not. It has to be the same
physical structure.

2142
03:03:08,612 --> 03:03:14,608
TRAVIS: Wait a minute. We don't want him walking
through the streets, to The Arches, as a

2143
03:03:14,608 --> 03:03:16,481
celestial. We want to get him in the house.

2144
03:03:16,481 --> 03:03:18,311
TALIESIN: When he pops his wings, the wings will
be gold.

2145
03:03:18,311 --> 03:03:19,611
TRAVIS: Yeah, we haven't started walking though.

2146
03:03:19,611 --> 03:03:21,642
LIAM: Can they be gold, delayed later, when they
pop out?

2147
03:03:21,642 --> 03:03:23,328
MATT: We'll find out.

2148
03:03:23,328 --> 03:03:24,528
LIAM: Oh, shit. Well.

2149
03:03:24,528 --> 03:03:26,683
ASHLEY: Can you hide them under a cape?

2150
03:03:26,683 --> 03:03:28,349
SAM: I don't know where you hide them normally.

2151
03:03:28,349 --> 03:03:29,627
LAURA: They only last for an hour.

2152
03:03:29,627 --> 03:03:30,848
LIAM: In my shoulder blades.

2153
03:03:30,848 --> 03:03:33,441
SAM: They're in you? Ew.

2154
03:03:33,441 --> 03:03:34,926
LIAM: Yeah, well, it feels that way.

2155
03:03:34,926 --> 03:03:37,006
SAM: Are you Wolverine?

2156
03:03:37,006 --> 03:03:39,184
TALIESIN: We are learning way too much about
everyone.

2157
03:03:39,184 --> 03:03:41,750
TRAVIS: So Seeming on everybody but Vax, right?

2158
03:03:41,750 --> 03:03:44,599
SAM: No.

2159
03:03:44,599 --> 03:03:47,826
LAURA: No. Why?

2160
03:03:47,826 --> 03:03:50,151
LIAM: The Seeming on us-- We look like us
already.

2161
03:03:50,151 --> 03:03:51,264
LAURA: It's just clothes, though.

2162
03:03:51,264 --> 03:03:52,314
TRAVIS: Have we headed to The Arches yet?

2163
03:03:52,314 --> 03:03:54,538
SAM: We're walking there right now.

2164
03:03:54,538 --> 03:03:56,152
TRAVIS: We're going to walk with a celestial in
the middle of the streets?

2165
03:03:56,152 --> 03:03:58,984
LAURA: No, we're saying we're not making his wings
look like that yet, dude.

2166
03:03:58,984 --> 03:04:01,298
MATT: You guys are not sure where The Arches are.

2167
03:04:01,298 --> 03:04:02,926
LAURA: Oh. Senokir?

2168
03:04:02,926 --> 03:04:04,410
MATT: "Yes?"

2169
03:04:04,410 --> 03:04:07,080
MARISHA: Should we maybe go scout the location
first as regular slaves?

2170
03:04:07,080 --> 03:04:08,653
LAURA, SAM and TALIESIN : No.

2171
03:04:08,653 --> 03:04:10,232
MATT: "What do you require?"

2172
03:04:10,232 --> 03:04:12,710
LAURA: Hi, where are The Arches?

2173
03:04:12,710 --> 03:04:21,251
MATT: "Do you require guidance there? Uten, why
don't you bring them to The Arches. I will not be

2174
03:04:21,251 --> 03:04:22,593
"joining you."

2175
03:04:22,593 --> 03:04:23,943
TALIESIN: That's very fair.

2176
03:04:23,943 --> 03:04:30,032
MATT: "I wish not to get involved with a pit
fiend. I will ask though, just to be safe, if I

2177
03:04:30,032 --> 03:04:39,404
"could have, of your choice, one small bauble to
remember you by. As we still have an arrangement

2178
03:04:39,404 --> 03:04:45,185
"to discuss, and knowing, to an extent, your
capabilities, there's a chance that you might

2179
03:04:45,185 --> 03:04:48,477
"escape without returning to me."

2180
03:04:48,477 --> 03:04:53,775
LIAM: Is that for memories or for some voodoo
shit?

2181
03:04:53,775 --> 03:04:55,401
LAURA: It's voodoo shit.

2182
03:04:55,401 --> 03:05:00,839
MATT: "It is to make sure that should you abscond
without upholding your end of the deal, I can find you."

2183
03:05:00,839 --> 03:05:02,630
LIAM: From each of us or--

2184
03:05:02,630 --> 03:05:04,931
TRAVIS: I can give him one of the Sandkheg
bottles.

2185
03:05:04,931 --> 03:05:10,011
MARISHA: No, it's okay. I Druidcraft a band around
his arm.

2186
03:05:10,011 --> 03:05:16,837
MATT: "Thank you. That'll die soon."

2187
03:05:16,837 --> 03:05:20,971
MARISHA: You can, like, preserve it.

2188
03:05:20,971 --> 03:05:22,846
TRAVIS: No, it's going to die, Keyleth. Don't--

2189
03:05:22,846 --> 03:05:31,388
MATT: "It'll still function. It just will be
lifeless. So, continue please. Stay safe."

2190
03:05:31,388 --> 03:05:33,644
TALIESIN: Okay.

2191
03:05:33,644 --> 03:05:34,773
SAM: Yeah, great.

2192
03:05:34,773 --> 03:05:35,829
TRAVIS: We go.

2193
03:05:35,829 --> 03:05:41,713
MATT: Uten is like, "Okay, follow me. I will lead
you." Even he is looking a little weird over at

2194
03:05:41,713 --> 03:05:43,972
Senokir.

2195
03:05:43,972 --> 03:05:49,844
SAM: And when I cast Seeming, I also cast it on
myself, making myself look like an azer?

2196
03:05:49,844 --> 03:05:53,430
MATT: An azer. The flaming beard dwarf.

2197
03:05:53,430 --> 03:05:56,277
SAM: Yeah, I don't know if I can make flames with
Seeming.

2198
03:05:56,277 --> 03:06:01,050
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of the illusion
you can pull off something that resembles flames

2199
03:06:01,050 --> 03:06:02,509
enough to the point where it should pass.

2200
03:06:02,509 --> 03:06:03,574
SAM: All right, great.

2201
03:06:03,574 --> 03:06:09,923
MATT: All right, so, as you guys walk out into the
city, you are lead by Uten on a similar path that

2202
03:06:09,923 --> 03:06:27,054
led you by the Pyriculum where you met Whaska,
but you continue past that in the northeast

2203
03:06:27,054 --> 03:06:31,693
direction heading towards, as he tells you as you
pass, near the naval grounds of the Sea of Fire.

2204
03:06:31,693 --> 03:06:38,611
Beyond that, you guys find the streets become wider
and the network of clusters of metal cages begin to

2205
03:06:38,611 --> 03:06:45,090
adorn portions of the center street islands.
Within these cages, you see humanoids of all

2206
03:06:45,090 --> 03:06:52,741
walks of life, creatures, beasts; it's a
collection, a veritable zoo of entities from all

2207
03:06:52,741 --> 03:07:00,426
the planes, all bound to various cages, chains,
and other elements, whereas efreeti individually

2208
03:07:00,426 --> 03:07:06,527
bark from top in a language you don't understand.
You see large banners and streamers set across

2209
03:07:06,527 --> 03:07:14,427
elements of the road to mark various segments of
this area, and at this point Uten turns to you and

2210
03:07:14,427 --> 03:07:22,529
goes, "Well, you have officially reached The
Arches. I will bid you adieu as I also will not

2211
03:07:22,529 --> 03:07:24,599
"want to deal with a pit fiend. Good luck."

2212
03:07:24,599 --> 03:07:25,741
LAURA: Wait, Uten.

2213
03:07:25,741 --> 03:07:26,767
MATT: (sighs) "Yes."

2214
03:07:26,767 --> 03:07:30,068
LAURA: So what happens? Are these all for sale
then and--?

2215
03:07:30,068 --> 03:07:33,807
MATT: "All the ones that do not look like they're
yelling for you to buy something. Most likely."

2216
03:07:33,807 --> 03:07:41,357
LAURA: Okay, and then other people come through.
So, if you like do the door thing here then this

2217
03:07:41,357 --> 03:07:43,302
could potentially be a market.

2218
03:07:43,302 --> 03:07:45,509
MARISHA: Is it okay to just set up shop?

2219
03:07:45,509 --> 03:07:48,266
MATT: "If you are convincing enough."

2220
03:07:48,266 --> 03:07:50,418
LAURA: Convincing enough?

2221
03:07:50,418 --> 03:07:54,648
LIAM: Do we need a shingle to put out front?

2222
03:07:54,648 --> 03:07:56,329
SAM: A sign?

2223
03:07:56,329 --> 03:07:58,309
LIAM: Flowers to make it look pretty?

2224
03:07:58,309 --> 03:08:01,550
TALIESIN: Keyleth, can you shape something?

2225
03:08:01,550 --> 03:08:07,770
LIAM: Oh my god, you look just like my sister! You
look just like me! That is fucking weird--

2226
03:08:07,770 --> 03:08:09,995
(laughter)

2227
03:08:09,995 --> 03:08:14,751
LIAM: I'm going to go stand over by Grog. I'll
talk to you later, never mind.

2228
03:08:14,751 --> 03:08:19,756
MATT: You go walk over to Grog and look up at a
much larger, slightly butcher version of yourself

2229
03:08:19,756 --> 03:08:21,506
staring down at you.

2230
03:08:21,506 --> 03:08:23,907
LIAM: Yeah! Slightly? Completely butcher!

2231
03:08:23,907 --> 03:08:26,428
(laughter)

2232
03:08:26,428 --> 03:08:28,334
TRAVIS: What's up, me?

2233
03:08:28,334 --> 03:08:32,697
SAM: Are we going to pose and start selling?

2234
03:08:32,697 --> 03:08:37,452
LAURA: I mean, we'll set up shop and only sell to
him.

2235
03:08:37,452 --> 03:08:43,661
MARISHA: I could also, theoretically-- I just
don't know well these things can see through other

2236
03:08:43,661 --> 03:08:51,342
things. I could do Hallucinatory Terrain right
around this and make us look like a little legit

2237
03:08:51,342 --> 03:08:55,719
kiosk. With a little entrance incorporating your
door.

2238
03:08:55,719 --> 03:08:57,702
SAM: How much can you change the--

2239
03:08:57,702 --> 03:09:00,152
MARISHA: I can control it as much as I want.

2240
03:09:00,152 --> 03:09:03,075
TALIESIN: Can you grow a gazebo?

2241
03:09:03,075 --> 03:09:06,340
LAURA: Yeah, but people will see the gazebo appear
out of nowhere.

2242
03:09:06,340 --> 03:09:08,416
TALIESIN: It's a magical tent.

2243
03:09:08,416 --> 03:09:13,784
SAM: What do we need to sell people? We just need
a slab to put them up on. To say, "Look here,

2244
03:09:13,784 --> 03:09:15,446
"there's this one for sale."

2245
03:09:15,446 --> 03:09:19,291
LAURA: Yeah, but we need the mansion door to get
him inside so we're not going to have us outside.

2246
03:09:19,291 --> 03:09:21,230
Are we?

2247
03:09:21,230 --> 03:09:24,173
SAM: Yeah, of course, we're going to have you guys
outside. How else are we going to convince him

2248
03:09:24,173 --> 03:09:26,152
that there is more good stuff inside?

2249
03:09:26,152 --> 03:09:27,344
LAURA: Oh, I understand.

2250
03:09:27,344 --> 03:09:28,885
LIAM: We're the showroom window.

2251
03:09:28,885 --> 03:09:31,662
TALIESIN: Can you grow a gazebo out of
grapevines?

2252
03:09:31,662 --> 03:09:35,027
SAM: Or just a stone slab? We don't need much.
Let's not break the bank.

2253
03:09:35,027 --> 03:09:41,396
MARISHA: I mean, I could do some Druidcraft but
that's minor. Growing a gazebo out of vines,

2254
03:09:41,396 --> 03:09:50,664
that's Plant Growth. I guess I could do Plant
Growth fairly instantly, without the full--

2255
03:09:50,664 --> 03:09:52,869
because it's a one or the other kind of a thing.

2256
03:09:52,869 --> 03:09:54,799
LAURA: I thought you said Hallucinatory Terrain?

2257
03:09:54,799 --> 03:09:56,169
SAM: Why do we need a fucking gazebo?

2258
03:09:56,169 --> 03:09:57,419
LAURA: Let's just fucking stand here.

2259
03:09:57,419 --> 03:10:00,332
LIAM: We don't want to look like Three Card Monte
guys with a cardboard box--

2260
03:10:00,332 --> 03:10:03,054
LAURA: What if we danced?

2261
03:10:03,054 --> 03:10:04,998
SAM: Matthew, what does everyone else have around
them?

2262
03:10:04,998 --> 03:10:09,774
MARISHA: I still feel like if we are a crowd of
slaves at a door--

2263
03:10:09,774 --> 03:10:11,939
SAM: What are the other kiosks? Are there any?

2264
03:10:11,939 --> 03:10:20,435
MATT: There are many scenarios in which you see
people being sold. You find elevated wooden

2265
03:10:20,435 --> 03:10:29,590
platforms, you find metallic stages that are being
lifted by slaves, held up, where the barker shouts

2266
03:10:29,590 --> 03:10:34,791
out among them. There are all sorts of
presentations, each person is trying to shout over

2267
03:10:34,791 --> 03:10:40,635
the other. Many of the various humanoids and
efreeti you see in the vicinity are all yelling

2268
03:10:40,635 --> 03:10:47,252
over each other and trying to catch attention.
It's this weird constant barking, almost auction

2269
03:10:47,252 --> 03:10:51,779
type atmosphere, where it's a lot of din, noise,
music, and voices shouting over each other. It's

2270
03:10:51,779 --> 03:10:56,621
also very crowded in this area. There are a couple
small parts, there's like an alleyway nearby

2271
03:10:56,621 --> 03:11:00,405
where there is a little more of an opening. Like
if there was a spot to set up it would be there,

2272
03:11:00,405 --> 03:11:04,247
if not there's-- probably could traverse the rest
of the vicinity of the slave market but currently

2273
03:11:04,247 --> 03:11:08,328
where you are that's the one space that's not too
close to an existing shop.

2274
03:11:08,328 --> 03:11:09,777
TRAVIS: Set up there.

2275
03:11:09,777 --> 03:11:13,990
LAURA: Yeah, set up there. Then Grog, you lift him
up and make him look super tall and we're doing

2276
03:11:13,990 --> 03:11:15,527
this around him.

2277
03:11:15,527 --> 03:11:17,231
TRAVIS: The celestial will sell itself. We don't
need anything fancy.

2278
03:11:17,231 --> 03:11:18,259
LIAM: In a row, in a row.

2279
03:11:18,259 --> 03:11:19,706
LAURA: In a row, doing the same move.

2280
03:11:19,706 --> 03:11:28,510
MARISHA: Can I Druidcraft some nice inviting
looking bushes?

2281
03:11:28,510 --> 03:11:29,617
TRAVIS: Shrubs?

2282
03:11:29,617 --> 03:11:30,720
MARISHA: Shrubs, yeah.

2283
03:11:30,720 --> 03:11:34,596
MATT: Sure, which will definitely catch attention
because no vegetation exists here for the most part.

2284
03:11:34,596 --> 03:11:35,520
MARISHA: Never mind, then.

2285
03:11:35,520 --> 03:11:38,958
MATT: I'm just saying it would catch attention if
you want people to look in your area.

2286
03:11:38,958 --> 03:11:43,578
TALIESIN: No, it will be fancy. I think it will be
fancy.

2287
03:11:43,578 --> 03:11:44,654
MARISHA: What?

2288
03:11:44,654 --> 03:11:47,452
TALIESIN: Plants where there are no plants is
fancy.

2289
03:11:47,452 --> 03:11:48,949
TRAVIS: What?

2290
03:11:48,949 --> 03:11:53,006
ASHLEY: And if a slave can do that, that's pretty
special.

2291
03:11:53,006 --> 03:11:56,067
TRAVIS: Maybe we wait until we see him so we don't
get unwanted buyers.

2292
03:11:56,067 --> 03:12:01,409
ASHLEY: Maybe you can do some flair as people are
walking by.

2293
03:12:01,409 --> 03:12:02,567
SAM: Should we sit here and wait for a while?

2294
03:12:02,567 --> 03:12:03,454
TRAVIS: Yup.

2295
03:12:03,454 --> 03:12:10,780
TALIESIN: Let's keep an eye out. Why doesn't
whichever one of us is the one that can be sneaky

2296
03:12:10,780 --> 03:12:12,009
and look around.

2297
03:12:12,009 --> 03:12:13,372
LIAM: We all need to be voguing.

2298
03:12:13,372 --> 03:12:14,706
TRAVIS: We're staying together.

2299
03:12:14,706 --> 03:12:16,873
LAURA: We'll look as we're voguing.

2300
03:12:16,873 --> 03:12:18,365
TALIESIN: All right. All right.

2301
03:12:18,365 --> 03:12:21,320
TRAVIS: We wait to see if the pit fiend shows
himself.

2302
03:12:21,320 --> 03:12:26,255
SAM: Can you guys all do like the Robert Palmer
video?

2303
03:12:26,255 --> 03:12:31,041
(laughter)

2304
03:12:31,041 --> 03:12:32,675
MATT: (singing) Simply irresistible.

2305
03:12:32,675 --> 03:12:36,793
LAURA: Do you want to give us instruments and
we'll all play something?

2306
03:12:36,793 --> 03:12:41,911
SAM: Sure, sure. I'll play a little ditty. We'll
jam to it.

2307
03:12:41,911 --> 03:12:46,171
MATT: There is a series of smaller buildings in
the area. There is the main street that runs

2308
03:12:46,171 --> 03:12:53,053
through here and across that street is where there
are many of the various slave blocks and larger

2309
03:12:53,053 --> 03:12:57,456
platforms set. You guys find the entrance to this
alley way, which curves around behind you and there

2310
03:12:57,456 --> 03:13:02,760
is a large wall that leads to another section
beyond that. This is where you begin to set up or

2311
03:13:02,760 --> 03:13:06,912
where you're planning to set up shop. So you guys
wait there for a while. Looking about, you can see,

2312
03:13:06,912 --> 03:13:14,368
most of the people that are selling slaves there--
some of them are humanoid, some of them are kobold

2313
03:13:14,368 --> 03:13:21,072
servants, some of them are worse for wear, looking
like they are hoping to get sold soon before they

2314
03:13:21,072 --> 03:13:35,872
expire. You do see, across the way, two young boys
maybe about 15 or so years old, light blue--

2315
03:13:35,872 --> 03:13:37,314
(laughter)

2316
03:13:37,314 --> 03:13:38,736
MATT: No, Scanlan, no.

2317
03:13:38,736 --> 03:13:40,910
(laughter)

2318
03:13:40,910 --> 03:13:48,223
MATT: Light blue skin and pupil-less. They are held
by red-colored chains and they look broken of

2319
03:13:48,223 --> 03:13:49,538
spirit and they are both sitting with a hunch.

2320
03:13:49,538 --> 03:13:51,665
LAURA: Aw, can we get them? Go get them.

2321
03:13:51,665 --> 03:13:53,166
SAM: Poor Nightcrawler.

2322
03:13:53,166 --> 03:13:54,964
LAURA: Go get them and see if we can get them.

2323
03:13:54,964 --> 03:13:56,277
TRAVIS: Are they celestials?

2324
03:13:56,277 --> 03:13:59,405
SAM: I am going to go over there and buy these two
kids? For what?

2325
03:13:59,405 --> 03:14:01,043
LAURA: Maybe and then we can set them free once
we're out of here.

2326
03:14:01,043 --> 03:14:02,376
SAM: All right.

2327
03:14:02,376 --> 03:14:03,377
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: What?

2328
03:14:03,377 --> 03:14:05,951
TRAVIS: No, leave them alone.

2329
03:14:05,951 --> 03:14:07,438
SAM: This isn't our fight.

2330
03:14:07,438 --> 03:14:09,053
TRAVIS: Stay on target.

2331
03:14:09,053 --> 03:14:12,513
SAM: Do one of you want to go over there and say
hi, slave to slave?

2332
03:14:12,513 --> 03:14:14,478
LAURA: Yeah, I'll go over there.

2333
03:14:14,478 --> 03:14:17,290
SAM: Yeah, sure, go on.

2334
03:14:17,290 --> 03:14:19,919
MATT: Okay, Vex, by the way, your alignment's back
up to Chaotic Good.

2335
03:14:19,919 --> 03:14:22,684
LAURA: Oh! (fake sobs)

2336
03:14:22,684 --> 03:14:24,817
MATT: That was the last little push there with
that instance.

2337
03:14:24,817 --> 03:14:26,226
LIAM: I murder an old lady.

2338
03:14:26,226 --> 03:14:29,167
(laughter)

2339
03:14:29,167 --> 03:14:34,421
LIAM: Welcome back.

2340
03:14:34,421 --> 03:14:36,949
MATT: All right, so what are you doing?

2341
03:14:36,949 --> 03:14:41,002
SAM: I'll walk over with her so it doesn't seem
weird that my slave is wandering around, I

2342
03:14:41,002 --> 03:14:43,218
suppose. I guess?

2343
03:14:43,218 --> 03:14:46,139
LAURA: Yeah, talk to the guy and I'll talk to the
slaves.

2344
03:14:46,139 --> 03:14:47,268
SAM: They have an owner?

2345
03:14:47,268 --> 03:14:51,187
MATT: Yeah, as you approach the two of them, with
the red chain around their necks and arms and they

2346
03:14:51,187 --> 03:14:56,201
are leaning over the edge of the small wooden
platform looking dejected at the ground. And

2347
03:14:56,201 --> 03:15:02,231
approaching them, the skin itself is like a soft
white porcelain with a slight translucent blue hue

2348
03:15:02,231 --> 03:15:10,505
to it, white pupiless eyes. They look human, but
they are beautiful and out of place here. Even in

2349
03:15:10,505 --> 03:15:17,788
their destitution, you can't help but be struck by
their presence. Both their chains are currently

2350
03:15:17,788 --> 03:15:22,610
locked to this stump that is in the center of this
wooden platform and behind it you see this

2351
03:15:22,610 --> 03:15:34,049
grotesque-looking dwarf in very fine clothing that
is very very dirty and old. He stands there

2352
03:15:34,049 --> 03:15:42,766
clutching the edges of his lapel going, "All
right, we've got here before you two, two I found

2353
03:15:42,766 --> 03:15:47,307
"and kept beneath my will. For sale. With angel
blood within them."

2354
03:15:47,307 --> 03:16:00,263
SAM: (French accent) Hello, I am slave master
Francois Australia and I am curious about your two

2355
03:16:00,263 --> 03:16:01,826
angel boys.

2356
03:16:01,826 --> 03:16:03,109
(laughter)

2357
03:16:03,109 --> 03:16:07,588
MATT: "Well, if you're looking to purchase, these
will both set you back about 10,000 gold apiece or

2358
03:16:07,588 --> 03:16:09,249
"18 for the set."

2359
03:16:09,249 --> 03:16:15,182
SAM: (French accent) What can they do? I would be
curious to find out.

2360
03:16:15,182 --> 03:16:21,867
MATT: (whispering) "Whatever the fuck they can do
I don't know. I wasn't selling them for their

2361
03:16:21,867 --> 03:16:24,946
"skillset. I was selling them for their
uniqueness."

2362
03:16:24,946 --> 03:16:28,150
SAM: (French accent) How do you know anything
about these boys? How did you get them?

2363
03:16:28,150 --> 03:16:31,509
MATT: "What's it to you, small one?"

2364
03:16:31,509 --> 03:16:36,851
SAM: (French accent) I like to see a chain of
ownership so I know that the previous owner will

2365
03:16:36,851 --> 03:16:38,863
not hunt me down and kill me in the night!

2366
03:16:38,863 --> 03:16:43,907
MATT: "There is no previous owner! I went and got
them myself! The chain of ownership is this chain

2367
03:16:43,907 --> 03:16:48,624
"right here." He points to the one on the stump.
You can see greasy black hair that is parted in

2368
03:16:48,624 --> 03:16:56,527
the middle, mustache comes down into a weirdly
fluffy beard that has weird oily portions of it.

2369
03:16:56,527 --> 03:17:05,714
He's an awful-looking dwarf. "So, are you going to
buy or shall I wait for the ones I'm looking for?"

2370
03:17:05,714 --> 03:17:08,757
SAM: (French accent) Which ones are those?

2371
03:17:08,757 --> 03:17:10,831
(laughter)

2372
03:17:10,872 --> 03:17:12,045
MATT: "Piss off."

2373
03:17:12,045 --> 03:17:15,151
LAURA: (whispering) Offer him 15 for the pair.

2374
03:17:15,151 --> 03:17:23,188
SAM: (French accent) (whispering) Merci. (normal
volume) Would you take 15 for both of them?

2375
03:17:23,188 --> 03:17:29,855
MATT: "Are your ears clogged? I said ten each or
18 for the bundle!"

2376
03:17:29,855 --> 03:17:35,535
SAM: (French accent) Yes, but you don't seem to
know where they come from, who they belonged to

2377
03:17:35,535 --> 03:17:40,462
before. It's a risk that is possibly worth 3,000
gold.

2378
03:17:40,462 --> 03:17:43,244
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2379
03:17:43,244 --> 03:17:46,935
LIAM: This is how Sam wooed me in 2008.

2380
03:17:46,935 --> 03:17:48,601
(laughter)

2381
03:17:48,601 --> 03:17:50,473
SAM: Is this persuasion, solely? 20.

2382
03:17:50,473 --> 03:18:00,087
MATT: "Cash on hand? 15. (whispering) Don't tell
anyone I said that."

2383
03:18:00,087 --> 03:18:05,608
SAM: (French accent) Oui. Oh, slave, can I have
the gold?

2384
03:18:05,608 --> 03:18:07,506
(laughter)

2385
03:18:07,506 --> 03:18:14,377
SAM: (normal voice) Are we really going to do
this?

2386
03:18:14,377 --> 03:18:17,613
LAURA: Yeah, we are going to buy them. We are
buying them!

2387
03:18:17,613 --> 03:18:19,165
TRAVIS: We're taking in everything.

2388
03:18:19,165 --> 03:18:21,289
LAURA: They're so young! They're innocents.

2389
03:18:21,289 --> 03:18:22,980
TALIESIN: And then we have extra slaves, it's
beautiful.

2390
03:18:22,980 --> 03:18:29,951
MATT: "Haha. Well, it's been fine doing business
with you." He puts the coins away, pulls out a

2391
03:18:29,951 --> 03:18:33,720
piece of paper. "What's your full name?"

2392
03:18:33,720 --> 03:18:38,342
SAM: (French accent) Francois Bertrand Jean-Luc
Australia.

2393
03:18:38,342 --> 03:18:41,883
(laugher)

2394
03:18:41,883 --> 03:18:49,015
MATT: "Here you are. Transference of ownership."
Grabs the chains, unhooks them, takes the lock and

2395
03:18:49,015 --> 03:18:55,245
hands it to you. "They're yours to take. Now you
two shove off! Do what the man says."

2396
03:18:55,245 --> 03:18:57,287
SAM: (French accent) Do they have names?

2397
03:18:57,287 --> 03:19:00,821
MATT: "No! It's your choice to name them!"

2398
03:19:00,821 --> 03:19:01,846
SAM: Au revoir.

2399
03:19:01,846 --> 03:19:06,874
MATT: So as the two of you walk back with these
two chained boys who walk behind you--

2400
03:19:06,874 --> 03:19:08,934
LAURA: Do you speak Common?

2401
03:19:08,934 --> 03:19:12,130
MATT: (stuttering) "Yes."

2402
03:19:12,130 --> 03:19:14,014
LAURA: How did he find you?

2403
03:19:14,014 --> 03:19:23,150
MATT: "Well, we--" They both look at each other.
"It doesn't matter, it's you who own us now."

2404
03:19:23,150 --> 03:19:24,788
LAURA: It matters, dear.

2405
03:19:24,788 --> 03:19:30,533
TALIESIN: Let's not have this conversation with
them yet, sister, until all has been taken care of.

2406
03:19:30,533 --> 03:19:34,492
LAURA: Ugh. (retching)

2407
03:19:34,492 --> 03:19:36,685
TRAVIS: I see why we got them now. Even better
bait.

2408
03:19:36,685 --> 03:19:39,666
LAURA: Come stand over with us.

2409
03:19:39,666 --> 03:19:41,965
TALIESIN: What, sister?

2410
03:19:41,965 --> 03:19:44,339
LIAM: (retching)

2411
03:19:44,339 --> 03:19:46,988
MARISHA: This is what we are now.

2412
03:19:46,988 --> 03:19:55,779
LIAM: Grog, slap me really hard across the face
right now.

2413
03:19:55,779 --> 03:19:56,857
TRAVIS: Done.

2414
03:19:56,857 --> 03:20:06,458
MATT: Oh! He hits you and it's numb for minute.
You realize, why is the world sideways? He knocked

2415
03:20:06,458 --> 03:20:08,030
you to the ground.

2416
03:20:08,030 --> 03:20:11,423
LIAM: Sweet, sweet ignorance.

2417
03:20:11,423 --> 03:20:12,934
TALIESIN: Do you need a hand up, brother?

2418
03:20:12,934 --> 03:20:15,327
TRAVIS: Stop hitting yourself.

2419
03:20:15,327 --> 03:20:17,345
LIAM: I'm taking off a hit point.

2420
03:20:17,345 --> 03:20:32,371
MATT: The two children follow you back. They are
chained and you have them at your disposal. What

2421
03:20:32,371 --> 03:20:33,761
are you guys going to do?

2422
03:20:33,761 --> 03:20:34,871
TRAVIS: We're waiting.

2423
03:20:34,871 --> 03:20:37,628
SAM: We're just waiting, I guess.

2424
03:20:37,628 --> 03:20:39,249
LAURA: Do we have the mansion up?

2425
03:20:39,249 --> 03:20:47,358
SAM: Not yet. I'll say to the boys: You two, have
you been for sale for more than a day or two?

2426
03:20:47,358 --> 03:20:55,492
MATT: "He's had us here for three days. Sorry."

2427
03:20:55,492 --> 03:21:01,800
SAM: It's all right. In that time have you seen a
large red thing with big wings?

2428
03:21:01,800 --> 03:21:04,922
MATT: They both recoil, "No, no!"

2429
03:21:04,922 --> 03:21:12,149
SAM: Okay, all right. Thank you. We just wait, I
suppose.

2430
03:21:12,149 --> 03:21:13,520
LAURA: Yeah, I guess so.

2431
03:21:13,520 --> 03:21:14,760
SAM: You want to go buy a few more?

2432
03:21:14,760 --> 03:21:16,215
LAURA: No, no, no, sorry. I'm sorry.

2433
03:21:16,215 --> 03:21:17,630
ASHLEY: You could just say, Angels for sale!

2434
03:21:17,630 --> 03:21:22,414
LIAM: Wait, did you drop a bunch of gold on them?

2435
03:21:22,414 --> 03:21:25,509
LAURA: No! No, no, no, we got an amazing deal.

2436
03:21:25,509 --> 03:21:26,504
LIAM: Like how much?

2437
03:21:26,504 --> 03:21:30,930
LAURA: Like, 50 gold. It was so affordable.

2438
03:21:30,930 --> 03:21:32,956
TALIESIN: I want to do an insight check on that.

2439
03:21:32,956 --> 03:21:34,257
MATT: Go for it.

2440
03:21:34,257 --> 03:21:41,973
TALIESIN: Insight check, okay, that's 22.

2441
03:21:41,973 --> 03:21:45,536
MATT: Make a deception check.

2442
03:21:45,536 --> 03:21:52,366
LAURA: With my gold. Yikes, no, I don't win.

2443
03:21:52,366 --> 03:21:54,317
MATT: She is lying through her teeth.

2444
03:21:54,317 --> 03:21:59,019
TALIESIN: You're an idiot and I'm very proud of
you. Don't do that again.

2445
03:21:59,019 --> 03:22:05,301
LAURA: Don't talk to me right now. Just don't.

2446
03:22:05,301 --> 03:22:06,439
(laughter)

2447
03:22:06,439 --> 03:22:08,561
TALIESIN: What if I were to do a very strange
accent?

2448
03:22:08,561 --> 03:22:10,999
LAURA: No, also not attractive.

2449
03:22:10,999 --> 03:22:13,980
SAM: (Vex impersonation) What if you were to talk
like Vex?

2450
03:22:13,980 --> 03:22:15,755
LAURA: Don't! Stop.

2451
03:22:15,755 --> 03:22:17,816
(laughter)

2452
03:22:17,816 --> 03:22:25,334
LIAM: I have found, put your hand up here like
this when you're talking to them because Percival

2453
03:22:25,334 --> 03:22:27,234
sounds like Percival.

2454
03:22:27,234 --> 03:22:32,993
MATT: While they're talking, Keyleth, you notice,
across the way, the dwarf they had spoken to and

2455
03:22:32,993 --> 03:22:39,269
purchased these two from has packed up his things
and looks around, pulls a wand out, does a large

2456
03:22:39,269 --> 03:22:42,007
circle, and him and his kiosk vanishes.

2457
03:22:42,007 --> 03:22:43,245
LIAM: We fit right in.

2458
03:22:43,245 --> 03:22:46,911
MARISHA: See, there are a lot of pop-up vendors
here, guys.

2459
03:22:46,911 --> 03:22:51,368
TALIESIN: Good to know. So if you summon your
magical room--

2460
03:22:51,368 --> 03:22:53,677
MARISHA: Maybe you'll be more impressive.

2461
03:22:53,677 --> 03:22:55,540
SAM: Makes sense.

2462
03:22:55,540 --> 03:22:59,339
TRAVIS: Can I survey the road in the direction of
the embassy. Do we see anything?

2463
03:22:59,339 --> 03:23:02,120
MATT: Make a perception check.

2464
03:23:02,120 --> 03:23:03,619
TRAVIS: Natural one.

2465
03:23:03,619 --> 03:23:04,970
LAURA: Aw, man!

2466
03:23:04,970 --> 03:23:13,736
MATT: You look over in the direction of the
embassy and you stare at the embassy and from this

2467
03:23:13,736 --> 03:23:16,527
far away it's hard to make out the shape but--

2468
03:23:16,527 --> 03:23:19,736
TRAVIS: It looks like the letter ah--

2469
03:23:19,736 --> 03:23:21,087
TALIESIN: You only know two. Pick one.

2470
03:23:21,087 --> 03:23:22,669
(laughter)

2471
03:23:22,669 --> 03:23:24,122
TRAVIS: And I stay there.

2472
03:23:24,122 --> 03:23:26,410
TALIESIN: G and R, that's what you've got.

2473
03:23:26,410 --> 03:23:27,712
LAURA: That is so sad.

2474
03:23:27,712 --> 03:23:33,269
MARISHA: I could try and scry on him while we
wait.

2475
03:23:33,269 --> 03:23:34,500
SAM: Yeah, scry again.

2476
03:23:34,500 --> 03:23:35,883
TRAVIS: Nobody else wants to check the road?

2477
03:23:35,883 --> 03:23:38,497
MARISHA: There is an alley behind us that we set
up in front of?

2478
03:23:38,497 --> 03:23:42,581
MATT: Yes, there is an alley behind you for about
20 or so feet and then it curves off.

2479
03:23:42,581 --> 03:23:45,793
MARISHA: Does anyone seem to be behind the alley?

2480
03:23:45,793 --> 03:23:47,420
MATT: From what you can see currently, no.

2481
03:23:47,420 --> 03:23:49,320
MARISHA: Scanlan.

2482
03:23:49,320 --> 03:23:50,276
SAM: Oi?

2483
03:23:50,276 --> 03:23:54,956
MARISHA: Do you want to come with me back into the
alley for a little bit and watch, in case anyone

2484
03:23:54,956 --> 03:24:00,664
sees? You could be giving me a good firm scolding,
just in case.

2485
03:24:00,664 --> 03:24:03,231
LAURA: Scanlan should be visible at all times.

2486
03:24:03,231 --> 03:24:06,569
MARISHA: Well, it takes a minute to do the
Scrying.

2487
03:24:06,569 --> 03:24:15,087
SAM: Vax, Vex, don't argue, we'll get through
this. I mean, I'm going to go back with you so--

2488
03:24:15,087 --> 03:24:16,726
MARISHA: Stand guard, I'll be right back.

2489
03:24:16,726 --> 03:24:18,596
SAM: Sure, I'll stand watch.

2490
03:24:18,596 --> 03:24:22,660
MARISHA: I go back to a little dark corner and I
pull out the Scrying Eye.

2491
03:24:22,660 --> 03:24:25,836
TALIESIN: Pike--

2492
03:24:25,836 --> 03:24:30,201
ASHLEY: No, no, my name is Vex.

2493
03:24:30,201 --> 03:24:38,540
TALIESIN: Vex, sister, do you want to perhaps do a
walk around with the two boys and see if we can't

2494
03:24:38,540 --> 03:24:40,011
attract some attention?

2495
03:24:40,011 --> 03:24:41,018
ASHLEY: Sure.

2496
03:24:41,018 --> 03:24:43,111
SAM: We're splitting the party.

2497
03:24:43,111 --> 03:24:49,223
TALIESIN: I'm not getting far but I'm going to
take the two boys--

2498
03:24:49,223 --> 03:24:51,689
LAURA: You be careful with them.

2499
03:24:51,689 --> 03:24:58,868
TALIESIN: I'll be very careful with them. I'm
going to say, don't talk to anyone, don't look

2500
03:24:58,868 --> 03:25:02,832
anyone in the eye, and don't answer any questions
without my permission, do you understand?

2501
03:25:02,832 --> 03:25:04,001
MATT: "Yes."

2502
03:25:04,001 --> 03:25:06,181
ASHLEY: And don't be scared.

2503
03:25:06,181 --> 03:25:08,148
MATT: "Okay."

2504
03:25:08,148 --> 03:25:14,244
TALIESIN: I've got a plan, follow my lead. This
should be interesting.

2505
03:25:14,244 --> 03:25:22,496
MATT: As you guys begin to wander off with the two
boys, Keyleth, you hold the scry crystal in your

2506
03:25:22,496 --> 03:25:27,933
hand and, as you focus, you see this flash of heat
in your mind and then darkness again. The spell has

2507
03:25:27,933 --> 03:25:31,115
no effect.

2508
03:25:31,115 --> 03:25:32,720
LAURA: He's not even here.

2509
03:25:32,720 --> 03:25:34,750
SAM: Or he's blocking it somehow.

2510
03:25:34,750 --> 03:25:38,082
LAURA: No, I bet he's in the fucking Nine Hells
right now.

2511
03:25:38,082 --> 03:25:39,889
SAM: Getting some money to go and come to the
slave market.

2512
03:25:39,889 --> 03:25:43,064
LAURA: Yeah, he's probably sold all the people
that were hanging out with him last time.

2513
03:25:43,064 --> 03:25:48,112
MATT: Just so you're aware, the scry spell fails
if they're not on your plane of existence or if

2514
03:25:48,112 --> 03:25:49,524
they succeed their saving throw.

2515
03:25:49,524 --> 03:25:51,940
SAM: Ah!

2516
03:25:51,940 --> 03:25:53,346
TALIESIN: You can try again in ten minutes.

2517
03:25:53,346 --> 03:25:54,526
MARISHA: I can try again.

2518
03:25:54,526 --> 03:26:00,103
TALIESIN: I'm going to look around for something
interesting.

2519
03:26:00,103 --> 03:26:09,150
MATT: Okay, you begin to walk around, you hear the
barking of various heavy-throated creatures. You

2520
03:26:09,150 --> 03:26:16,943
come across this large, it looks almost like a
wolf or dog but the face is a little less

2521
03:26:16,943 --> 03:26:20,940
pronounced like a wolf and a little more humanoid
in the front, but it is still bestial and

2522
03:26:20,940 --> 03:26:26,780
monstrous. The coat is gray and matted and you can
see these long fangs protruding. It barks and

2523
03:26:26,780 --> 03:26:30,470
snarls but every single time it reaches for the
bars-- and the bars themselves look like a flimsy

2524
03:26:30,470 --> 03:26:35,598
wood-- but as it tries to tear at them or bite
there is a spark of arcane energy and it backs up

2525
03:26:35,598 --> 03:26:39,649
and seems to recoil from the attack and begins to
pace back and forth in its cage again.

2526
03:26:39,649 --> 03:26:50,478
TALIESIN: I try and discern who runs this
establishment.

2527
03:26:50,478 --> 03:26:55,494
MATT: You also see behind that, there are two more
cages that contain these very large insect-like

2528
03:26:55,494 --> 03:27:02,611
creatures that have very long bodies with multiple
legs, looks like a set of eight or so legs, almost

2529
03:27:02,611 --> 03:27:06,900
like an oversized praying mantis, the giant
pincers in the front, but they are currently

2530
03:27:06,900 --> 03:27:12,326
collapsed on the ground within their cages resting
in the heat. Behind them you see an individual

2531
03:27:12,326 --> 03:27:24,100
that appears to be a similar racial background as
Senokir, but is older with this red and graying

2532
03:27:24,100 --> 03:27:29,919
goatee that comes to a very defined point at the
end of the chin and is currently sitting, sipping

2533
03:27:29,919 --> 03:27:33,893
off of a wine skin and watching you. (slurp)

2534
03:27:33,893 --> 03:27:37,239
TALIESIN: Most humble greetings, good master.

2535
03:27:37,239 --> 03:27:40,395
ASHLEY: I'll bow as well.

2536
03:27:40,395 --> 03:27:46,734
TALIESIN: My sister and I have been sent by our
owner to peruse the market for things that he

2537
03:27:46,734 --> 03:27:54,185
might enjoy and I have been asked to inquire upon
the nature of what you're selling and your

2538
03:27:54,185 --> 03:27:58,960
suggested price. Never making eye contact.

2539
03:27:58,960 --> 03:28:14,575
MATT: "Very well. We have today, and today only,
two ankhegs for sale. Mind you, not bound. The

2540
03:28:14,575 --> 03:28:26,721
"will is yours to break. And one barghest at the
front. The prices: the ankhegs are 500 gold

2541
03:28:26,721 --> 03:28:29,849
"apiece, the barghest, 8,000 gold."

2542
03:28:29,849 --> 03:28:38,019
TALIESIN: My master is always interested in
creatures of unusual disposition and he will be

2543
03:28:38,019 --> 03:28:50,603
excited to know what you have for sale. I thank
you for your time. May I please leave your-- I've

2544
03:28:50,603 --> 03:28:51,464
lost my brain.

2545
03:28:51,464 --> 03:28:52,754
MATT: "Yes, please, go."

2546
03:28:52,754 --> 03:29:00,203
TALIESIN: I bow, I back off properly. What are you
feeding me in this cup?

2547
03:29:00,203 --> 03:29:02,976
(laughter)

2548
03:29:02,976 --> 03:29:07,825
MATT: As time progresses and you guys have been
wandering around, eventually the image does come

2549
03:29:07,825 --> 03:29:10,935
across your mind as you wish to-- You wanted to
Scry again?

2550
03:29:10,935 --> 03:29:12,237
MARISHA: Yeah, whenever I can.

2551
03:29:12,237 --> 03:29:16,384
MATT: Okay. Still no success, unfortunately.

2552
03:29:16,384 --> 03:29:22,796
TALIESIN: I'm making sure that the whole market
knows that there is someone perusing and

2553
03:29:22,796 --> 03:29:28,464
purchasing for unusual creatures and making sure
they see the weird twins and the two angelic-- I'm

2554
03:29:28,464 --> 03:29:33,252
making a show of it. And I'm making a show of our
non-chained obedience.

2555
03:29:33,252 --> 03:29:44,917
MATT: As it progresses, the actual twins, you
notice far up the way to where The Arches begin,

2556
03:29:44,917 --> 03:29:55,982
you see a sight you've been seeking this entire
time. You see a large, deep red entity begin

2557
03:29:55,982 --> 03:30:02,480
strolling down the street with its burly rippling
armored muscles, its giant red wings flared out

2558
03:30:02,480 --> 03:30:09,781
behind it, its horned head and crest piercing the
sky behind it as its burning eyes and fanged jaw

2559
03:30:09,781 --> 03:30:15,519
and mouth. He lumps forward with each step, and as
it does, you begin to see the essence of the

2560
03:30:15,519 --> 03:30:20,094
necklace that had been described previously,
dangling around its neck.

2561
03:30:20,094 --> 03:30:22,368
LIAM: Preemptive jenga.

2562
03:30:22,368 --> 03:30:27,921
SAM: All right, we go back to the sales area.

2563
03:30:27,921 --> 03:30:32,935
TALIESIN: We're not going to hurry. We're going to
meander so that maybe we get seen.

2564
03:30:32,935 --> 03:30:34,447
ASHLEY: He gets a glimpse, yeah.

2565
03:30:34,447 --> 03:30:43,847
LIAM: Can I tell you something really quick? I am super
impressed with you. That was very kind. That's it.

2566
03:30:43,847 --> 03:30:45,626
Get ready.

2567
03:30:45,626 --> 03:30:52,904
MATT: As you guys wait in the spot that you've
chosen, the pit fiend, as you've rightfully

2568
03:30:52,904 --> 03:30:57,519
designated it at this point, begins walking
through and slowly making its way through the

2569
03:30:57,519 --> 03:31:05,518
crowd. As it glances around, you can see it
strolling up to a few bars and running its claws

2570
03:31:05,518 --> 03:31:19,105
across. You hear the (clanking) sound of it--
thank you, Criss Angel. You see it running its

2571
03:31:19,105 --> 03:31:24,504
claws across the bars with a heavy (clanking). It
seems disinterested by many of the creatures that

2572
03:31:24,504 --> 03:31:26,403
it passes by.

2573
03:31:26,403 --> 03:31:28,776
MARISHA: Should I do something theatrical?
Magicky?

2574
03:31:28,776 --> 03:31:42,018
SAM: I'll play a song. (singing) Hot in the city,
hot in the city tonight! Tonight!

2575
03:31:42,018 --> 03:31:43,988
MATT: Make a perform check.

2576
03:31:43,988 --> 03:31:51,799
SAM: 23.

2577
03:31:51,799 --> 03:31:57,542
MATT: (heavy footsteps) It begins to eventually
cross paths with the alley where you guys are

2578
03:31:57,542 --> 03:32:09,186
situated. It turns its head and looks down to you,
with your flaming beard and fire-wreathed head,

2579
03:32:09,186 --> 03:32:18,082
playing your song. It slows its gait ever so
slightly. It is an imposing and frightening

2580
03:32:18,082 --> 03:32:22,821
entity. Even just being in its presence, even as
you play the best you can, you feel everything

2581
03:32:22,821 --> 03:32:27,760
almost slowed down in its proximity as its sheer
immensity passes you, leaving you in its shadow

2582
03:32:27,760 --> 03:32:34,564
for a momentary bit of time. In that moment, you
feel the back of your neck stand on end. All the

2583
03:32:34,564 --> 03:32:44,151
hairs immediately come to full point. You feel
cold and alone as it sets its eyes upon you. It

2584
03:32:44,151 --> 03:32:47,032
moves its gaze beyond and continues walking.

2585
03:32:47,032 --> 03:32:48,862
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk by with the slaves.

2586
03:32:48,862 --> 03:32:54,941
MATT: Okay, so you come by, the other direction,
as you guys finish your meandering. As you walk

2587
03:32:54,941 --> 03:33:01,308
by, it (footsteps stopping). Looks at the two boys
that you've procured and slows.

2588
03:33:01,308 --> 03:33:08,769
SAM: I'll call out to Percy: (French accent) It's
no use! No one has enough money for our slaves!

2589
03:33:08,769 --> 03:33:11,362
Forget it. We should clean up and go home.

2590
03:33:11,362 --> 03:33:12,677
TALIESIN: Of course, master.

2591
03:33:12,677 --> 03:33:14,289
ASHLEY: Of course, sir. We tried so hard.

2592
03:33:14,289 --> 03:33:25,385
MATT: The pit fiend has turned about and is
standing there with its arms crossed, watching

2593
03:33:25,385 --> 03:33:33,929
this transpire maybe halfway up the block where
you guys had set up. Its eyes narrow with a bright

2594
03:33:33,929 --> 03:33:44,473
spark of yellow light that situates where its face
is. (heavy footsteps) It saunters up in your

2595
03:33:44,473 --> 03:33:49,356
direction, looks over to where the rest of you
are, and where the two--

2596
03:33:49,356 --> 03:33:54,672
SAM: Is he coming over?

2597
03:33:54,672 --> 03:33:56,028
MATT: He's heading in your direction.

2598
03:33:56,028 --> 03:33:59,778
SAM: Okay, I'll summon the magnificent mansion
door, and I'll say to the slaves:

2599
03:33:59,778 --> 03:34:03,946
(French accent) All right, it was worth a 
try, but we must pack it in.

2600
03:34:04,029 --> 03:34:10,163
MATT: As you're saying this, the pit fiend puts a
hand up. Its mouth doesn't move but you hear a

2601
03:34:10,163 --> 03:34:21,067
voice piercing deep inside your head. It says,
"Stop. I have discourse to make with you, small one."

2602
03:34:21,067 --> 03:34:25,651
SAM: But of course. I am here to sell, if you are
here to buy.

2603
03:34:25,651 --> 03:34:31,487
MATT: "I have interest with your aasimar."

2604
03:34:31,487 --> 03:34:36,242
SAM: (French accent) They are for sale, for a good
price.

2605
03:34:36,242 --> 03:34:39,479
TALIESIN: I've already brought them into the
mansion. I've already handed them off and said:

2606
03:34:39,479 --> 03:34:44,017
Put them very far downstairs. Hide them.

2607
03:34:44,017 --> 03:34:46,440
MATT: You bring them into the mansion?

2608
03:34:46,440 --> 03:34:51,750
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. I've brought them into the
mansion and have put them downstairs. The servants

2609
03:34:51,750 --> 03:34:54,354
are taking them down.

2610
03:34:54,354 --> 03:35:00,571
SAM: (French accent) We have already packed up for
the day, but if this is a serious business

2611
03:35:00,571 --> 03:35:05,078
proposal, well, I can go in and fetch them.

2612
03:35:05,078 --> 03:35:13,919
MATT: The creature leans down toward you, the pit
fiend's very presence itself almost causing the

2613
03:35:13,919 --> 03:35:20,882
air to vibrate around you. Though it is not the
largest creature that you've faced, there is

2614
03:35:20,882 --> 03:35:30,610
something about its presence that is purely evil.
A bastion of power across all elements of the

2615
03:35:30,610 --> 03:35:37,152
cosmos that you haven't had stare you down at
this proximity. As it leans forward, the voice

2616
03:35:37,152 --> 03:35:43,918
once again pierces the center of your brain. "It
would do well to bring them forth."

2617
03:35:43,918 --> 03:35:51,364
SAM: (French accent) I cannot just communicate
with them. Would you join me inside my shop? There

2618
03:35:51,364 --> 03:35:53,797
you will see many other fine specimens.

2619
03:35:53,797 --> 03:35:55,915
MATT: "What is your price?"

2620
03:35:55,915 --> 03:35:59,437
SAM: (French accent) Well, you haven't seen what I
have to offer.

2621
03:35:59,437 --> 03:36:01,748
MATT: "I have seen enough."

2622
03:36:01,748 --> 03:36:07,379
SAM: (French accent) So you are not interested in
the naga, the goristro, the other celestial

2623
03:36:07,379 --> 03:36:08,794
beings? The orcs?

2624
03:36:08,794 --> 03:36:10,582
MATT: Make a deception check.

2625
03:36:10,582 --> 03:36:14,446
TRAVIS: Deceiving the devil, come on, baby!

2626
03:36:14,446 --> 03:36:15,970
SAM: 31.

2627
03:36:15,970 --> 03:36:17,901
LIAM: (airhorn noises)

2628
03:36:17,901 --> 03:36:30,387
MATT: "Perhaps in time, but now I seek the aasimar
in your possession."

2629
03:36:30,387 --> 03:36:32,236
LIAM: But I did the airhorn!

2630
03:36:32,236 --> 03:36:44,860
SAM: (French accent) If you please, and with due
respect, I do not see any jewelry or fineries on

2631
03:36:44,860 --> 03:36:48,703
your person. Can you afford such prices that I
will quote you?

2632
03:36:48,703 --> 03:37:00,149
MATT: As you say this, the eyes narrow. It leans
back as its head cocks slightly. "Have you never

2633
03:37:00,149 --> 03:37:03,150
"done business in this city before?"

2634
03:37:03,150 --> 03:37:10,233
SAM: (French accent) I'm afraid that I haven't.
But if you are serious, and it seems that you are

2635
03:37:10,233 --> 03:37:13,500
by the way that you are not moving your mouth--

2636
03:37:13,500 --> 03:37:15,693
MATT: He begins walking away from you.

2637
03:37:15,693 --> 03:37:20,704
SAM: (French accent) Wait! Would you like to come
inside with me and see them for yourself?

2638
03:37:20,704 --> 03:37:25,651
MATT: It has completely written you off and is
walking northward, back from whence it came.

2639
03:37:25,651 --> 03:37:29,393
TRAVIS: Quick, throw a price out!

2640
03:37:29,393 --> 03:37:34,607
SAM: (French accent) 30,000 apiece!

2641
03:37:34,607 --> 03:37:45,356
MATT: (footsteps) Slows its gait, turns around,
(footsteps) keeps walking.

2642
03:37:45,356 --> 03:37:47,411
SAM: (French accent) 10,000!

2643
03:37:47,411 --> 03:37:58,630
MATT: It stops. Turns around and starts heading
back toward you. (footsteps) The voice once again

2644
03:37:58,630 --> 03:38:05,186
pierces, this time even more intense, more
oppressive. You've seen shadow. You've never

2645
03:38:05,186 --> 03:38:13,765
really felt it inside you before. The voice itself
presses against your will. You hear it say, "Your

2646
03:38:13,765 --> 03:38:26,083
"price is acceptable. You know the Embassy is good
to pay. Present the charges, and I will take them."

2647
03:38:26,083 --> 03:38:33,095
LAURA: Can I come out and bow before Scanlan and
say, "Forgive me, master, for interrupting, but

2648
03:38:33,095 --> 03:38:38,459
"the female aasimar is fighting back."

2649
03:38:38,459 --> 03:38:50,483
SAM: (French accent) Well, put her-- ugh-- I'm so
sorry, sir. I must go deal with this. I don't want

2650
03:38:50,483 --> 03:38:52,954
to make you wait here. You are clearly a man of
respect.

2651
03:38:52,954 --> 03:38:57,267
MATT: "I will wait." It stays there, across the
way, with its arms crossed, about ten feet from you.

2652
03:38:57,267 --> 03:38:59,445
SAM: (French accent) I will be right back, I
promise.

2653
03:38:59,445 --> 03:39:03,875
LAURA: I know she is much more powerful than the
boys, but we cannot control her.

2654
03:39:03,875 --> 03:39:07,404
SAM: Did she use <i>the magic</i>?

2655
03:39:07,404 --> 03:39:12,882
LAURA: All of it, my master! All of
the magic!

2656
03:39:12,882 --> 03:39:19,286
SAM: Oh my god. Oh my god! I run into the
mansion.

2657
03:39:19,286 --> 03:39:25,778
MATT: I would like you to make a deception check
and you to make a deception check, please.

2658
03:39:25,778 --> 03:39:29,635
TRAVIS: (laughing) Did she use <i>the magic</i>?

2659
03:39:29,635 --> 03:39:35,878
SAM: Can I inspire myself? Can I, after I know my
roll?

2660
03:39:35,878 --> 03:39:38,322
MATT: Yeah, that's part of what's good about it.

2661
03:39:38,322 --> 03:39:42,658
SAM: Oh. Well, then fucking yes, I'll inspire
myself. That helps.

2662
03:39:42,658 --> 03:39:43,926
MATT: What'd you roll?

2663
03:39:43,926 --> 03:39:45,036
SAM: One.

2664
03:39:45,036 --> 03:39:46,624
MATT: That's an auto-fail.

2665
03:39:46,624 --> 03:39:51,961
LAURA: I rolled a 28.

2666
03:39:51,961 --> 03:39:53,311
SAM: Hey, she's good!

2667
03:39:53,311 --> 03:40:03,673
MATT: Well, as you charge in, and you're staying
outside of the door? You watch as the creature,

2668
03:40:03,673 --> 03:40:10,872
staring at Scanlan-- or his persona-- talk to you
and then charge through the doorway. The pit fiend

2669
03:40:10,872 --> 03:40:17,765
(sniffs) looks over to you.

2670
03:40:17,765 --> 03:40:27,758
SAM: Inside the mansion, I run up to Grog and I
say: Cut me! Cut my face, cut my arms, cut me.

2671
03:40:27,758 --> 03:40:29,150
Right now.

2672
03:40:29,150 --> 03:40:32,677
TRAVIS: Okay, I pick him up by the top of his head
and I do a one, two, three!

2673
03:40:32,677 --> 03:40:39,695
LAURA: While I'm outside, I say: Could I offer you
some refreshments, great master?

2674
03:40:39,695 --> 03:40:51,770
MATT: The voice echoes through your head in a way
that is genuinely the stuff of nightmares. You

2675
03:40:51,770 --> 03:40:54,682
feel your will crack slightly at its presence. It
says, "No."

2676
03:40:54,682 --> 03:40:56,584
LAURA: (small voice) Okay.

2677
03:40:56,584 --> 03:40:59,381
TRAVIS: I also spit in your eye so it starts to
water.

2678
03:40:59,381 --> 03:41:06,273
SAM: Great. I run out of the mansion. (French
accent) Oh my god! Oh! It's incredible in there!

2679
03:41:06,273 --> 03:41:13,038
She is so powerful! She cut me with her mind!
Please, come with me, I will need help with this.

2680
03:41:13,038 --> 03:41:26,760
MATT: The voice says, "Your deceptions are
angering and useless. If there is no business to

2681
03:41:26,760 --> 03:41:35,511
"be had, I will let the embassy know. You will not
have business in this city ever again."

2682
03:41:35,511 --> 03:41:42,466
LIAM: I slowly flex out my black wings, slowly,
and lower them, and take a step half-covering you,

2683
03:41:42,466 --> 03:41:49,071
and say, Are you all right, master? Do you need my
help?

2684
03:41:49,071 --> 03:42:00,810
SAM: I think so? I'll say to the young man: All
right, I am sorry to play these games and haggle

2685
03:42:00,810 --> 03:42:04,355
with prices. I will go fetch them immediately.

2686
03:42:04,355 --> 03:42:09,763
I'll go in the mansion and yell: Fucking jenga!
We've got to fucking kill this guy! We've got to

2687
03:42:09,763 --> 03:42:17,571
go kill him right now! Come on! Let's go!

2688
03:42:17,571 --> 03:42:24,281
TRAVIS: Well, we're inside. Do we want to set up a
sneak attack? Can we?

2689
03:42:24,281 --> 03:42:25,705
LAURA: It's too late!

2690
03:42:25,705 --> 03:42:26,887
TRAVIS: Why?

2691
03:42:26,887 --> 03:42:30,835
LAURA: Because he's outside, dude! I'm out there
with him. So is Vax.

2692
03:42:30,835 --> 03:42:32,132
TRAVIS: Who's inside the mansion?

2693
03:42:32,132 --> 03:42:35,616
MARISHA: We didn't really specify.

2694
03:42:35,616 --> 03:42:37,064
MATT: Yeah, you're in the alleyway still.

2695
03:42:37,064 --> 03:42:38,498
MARISHA: I'm in the alleyway with the twins.

2696
03:42:38,498 --> 03:42:45,578
LIAM: How are the twins and boss-man here arranged
in the alley, or outside the door?

2697
03:42:45,578 --> 03:42:51,656
MATT: The doorway is in the alley. It's right
where the alley meets the street. Keyleth is

2698
03:42:51,656 --> 03:42:57,194
behind the alley. The twins are on the sides of
the doorway, so you guys are along the sidewalk of

2699
03:42:57,194 --> 03:43:07,154
the street. Grog is inside, along with Scanlan,
Percy, and Pike.

2700
03:43:07,154 --> 03:43:09,352
LIAM: What's our proximity to him?

2701
03:43:09,352 --> 03:43:13,518
MATT: He's about 15 feet from you guys. He's
across the street, at this point, with his arms

2702
03:43:13,518 --> 03:43:14,831
crossed, keeping a distance.

2703
03:43:14,831 --> 03:43:16,852
MARISHA: 15 feet across the street?

2704
03:43:16,852 --> 03:43:24,715
SAM: I can go out with the two angels, get him to
come over and look at them, at least. Then you

2705
03:43:24,715 --> 03:43:26,276
guys can pour out? I don't know.

2706
03:43:26,276 --> 03:43:29,756
TRAVIS: You can bring them out in front of the
house if you want to. Then when he walks over we can--

2707
03:43:29,756 --> 03:43:34,471
SAM: Yeah, bring them up.

2708
03:43:34,471 --> 03:43:42,332
LAURA: I don't want him to hurt them.

2709
03:43:42,332 --> 03:43:44,103
MARISHA: I packed this, just in case.

2710
03:43:44,103 --> 03:43:46,214
SAM: You want to be an angel?

2711
03:43:46,214 --> 03:43:48,376
MARISHA: No, I packed Feeblemind.

2712
03:43:48,376 --> 03:43:49,694
LAURA: What does that do?

2713
03:43:49,694 --> 03:43:51,091
SAM: It could maybe work.

2714
03:43:51,091 --> 03:43:55,218
MARISHA: It's an 8th-level spell, and it makes him
stupid.

2715
03:43:55,218 --> 03:43:56,699
SAM: Can you look like an angel?

2716
03:43:56,699 --> 03:44:01,703
MARISHA: No. Well, I could use Alter Self.

2717
03:44:01,703 --> 03:44:10,216
LAURA: Can you make yourself step out-- no, I said
there was a female.

2718
03:44:10,216 --> 03:44:12,453
MARISHA: As one of the female aasimar?

2719
03:44:12,453 --> 03:44:16,709
MATT: You guys are having this conversation over
your earpiece?

2720
03:44:16,709 --> 03:44:19,235
SAM: No, but we're in the-- oh shit. She's not
there.

2721
03:44:19,235 --> 03:44:23,516
MATT: I was going to say. But you're in direct
line of sight to the pit fiend.

2722
03:44:23,516 --> 03:44:25,460
LAURA: So I'm not saying anything. I'm sorry.

2723
03:44:25,460 --> 03:44:28,605
MARISHA: This guy has to make an intelligence
saving throw.

2724
03:44:28,605 --> 03:44:32,705
SAM: All right, you do whatever you want. Give me
the angels. I'm going to go back out there.

2725
03:44:32,705 --> 03:44:35,452
MARISHA: Do you want me to try and make this guy
stupid?

2726
03:44:35,452 --> 03:44:40,773
SAM: Yeah, if you can! Do whatever you can! All
I'm trying to do is get him to stay long enough

2727
03:44:40,773 --> 03:44:42,409
for you guys to do something.

2728
03:44:42,409 --> 03:44:43,635
TRAVIS: Yeah, get him to come toward the door.

2729
03:44:43,635 --> 03:44:45,800
MARISHA: He's 15 feet away?

2730
03:44:45,800 --> 03:44:47,827
SAM: Are you inside the mansion?

2731
03:44:47,827 --> 03:44:52,574
MARISHA: No, I'm outside. I'm in the alleyway. How
many feet away am I from him?

2732
03:44:52,574 --> 03:44:54,937
MATT: From him right now? About 35 feet.

2733
03:44:54,937 --> 03:44:56,267
MARISHA: Is he aware of my presence?

2734
03:44:56,267 --> 03:44:58,006
MATT: You don't know.

2735
03:44:58,006 --> 03:45:03,342
MARISHA: I'm going to saunter further down the
alleyway. This has a 150-foot range.

2736
03:45:03,342 --> 03:45:06,763
MATT: Okay, so you pull even further back? Okay,
make a stealth check.

2737
03:45:06,763 --> 03:45:11,861
MARISHA: Ooh, that's good. 21.

2738
03:45:11,861 --> 03:45:13,074
MATT: Okay.

2739
03:45:13,074 --> 03:45:19,496
SAM: I've got the angels. I'm walking back out.
Right?

2740
03:45:19,496 --> 03:45:20,407
LAURA: No!

2741
03:45:20,407 --> 03:45:21,522
ASHLEY: I'll be behind them.

2742
03:45:21,522 --> 03:45:26,583
MATT: Okay, so Pike is coming out with the two
aasimar.

2743
03:45:26,583 --> 03:45:30,442
LAURA: Fuck.

2744
03:45:30,442 --> 03:45:36,899
TRAVIS: I'll exit the mansion too, and start
walking toward the embassy a few steps, slowly.

2745
03:45:36,899 --> 03:45:38,508
Just to get distance.

2746
03:45:38,508 --> 03:45:43,215
LAURA: I get ready. The minute, well, never mind.

2747
03:45:43,215 --> 03:45:45,617
MARISHA: Okay. So wait, what are you doing?

2748
03:45:45,617 --> 03:45:47,790
SAM: I'm going outside with the two angels.

2749
03:45:47,790 --> 03:45:54,473
MATT: So, you exit with the reddish chains in hand
and both of the boys exit with you. As soon as

2750
03:45:54,473 --> 03:45:58,256
they walk out of the portal and they see, across
the way, the pit fiend standing there with his

2751
03:45:58,256 --> 03:46:03,988
arms crossed, they both (gasps) you hear the
breath escape their lungs as the fear hits them.

2752
03:46:03,988 --> 03:46:13,694
The pit fiend's arms go lax. You can see a bit of
a smile on its face, now. It looks like its

2753
03:46:13,694 --> 03:46:24,374
pensive frustration in waiting has been expended.
The voice says, "You will be paid."

2754
03:46:24,374 --> 03:46:26,778
SAM: All right.

2755
03:46:26,778 --> 03:46:28,095
TALIESIN: Money first.

2756
03:46:28,095 --> 03:46:31,749
SAM: I don't want to fucking bargain with this
thing.

2757
03:46:31,749 --> 03:46:36,967
MARISHA: As he goes to hand over the chains, right
as he goes to reach for it, I'm going to do

2758
03:46:36,967 --> 03:46:38,458
Feeblemind.

2759
03:46:38,458 --> 03:46:39,745
MATT: Feeblemind, okay.

2760
03:46:39,745 --> 03:46:41,336
MARISHA: Jesus fucking Christ!

2761
03:46:41,336 --> 03:46:43,499
SAM: Don't miss and hit me, babe!

2762
03:46:43,499 --> 03:46:45,847
MATT: All righty, what's the DC on this?

2763
03:46:45,847 --> 03:46:49,282
MARISHA: He's got to make an intelligence saving
throw.

2764
03:46:49,282 --> 03:46:51,339
MATT: Correct, and what's your spell DC?

2765
03:46:51,339 --> 03:46:52,301
MARISHA: 19.

2766
03:46:52,301 --> 03:46:53,264
MATT: 19. Okay.

2767
03:46:53,264 --> 03:46:54,638
LAURA: Oh god. Natural one, natural one.

2768
03:46:54,638 --> 03:46:57,008
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

2769
03:46:57,008 --> 03:47:05,006
MATT: All right. As it takes one step forward
toward Scanlan, you, in the back of the alleyway,

2770
03:47:05,006 --> 03:47:12,041
extend your finger. You watch as this slight shift
of light travels forward, like a slight ripple,

2771
03:47:12,041 --> 03:47:18,286
almost like a miniature breaking of the sound
barrier. Strikes across the air. Seems to collide

2772
03:47:18,286 --> 03:47:24,635
with the front of the pit fiend. As it hits, the
energy (fizzling) dissipates, not affecting its

2773
03:47:24,635 --> 03:47:28,841
form. You watch as the pit fiend suddenly, its
attention--

2774
03:47:28,841 --> 03:47:31,442
MARISHA: He takes 4d6 psychic damage.

2775
03:47:31,442 --> 03:47:33,844
MATT: He does.

2776
03:47:33,844 --> 03:47:37,453
LIAM: Was Scanlan walking toward him, or had they
gotten right up against each other?

2777
03:47:37,453 --> 03:47:40,633
LAURA: I release Trinket from my crystal
necklace.

2778
03:47:40,633 --> 03:47:45,705
MARISHA: He saved from it, didn't he?

2779
03:47:45,705 --> 03:47:48,764
MATT: He does not appear affected by the ability.

2780
03:47:48,764 --> 03:47:50,687
MARISHA: He's not affected by the ability?!

2781
03:47:50,687 --> 03:47:57,435
MATT: I mean, he took damage, but the Feeblemind
did not seem to alter him.

2782
03:47:57,435 --> 03:48:02,025
LAURA: Are there any of the efreeti guards
around?

2783
03:48:02,025 --> 03:48:08,633
MATT: Currently, you do not see any. However,
let's go ahead and pick up this confrontation next

2784
03:48:08,633 --> 03:48:14,795
week. It's 11:00. If we jump into this now, we'll
be here past midnight.

2785
03:48:14,795 --> 03:48:16,117
TALIESIN: No, yeah, we're calling it.

2786
03:48:16,117 --> 03:48:18,169
MARISHA: Gives us time to think.

2787
03:48:18,169 --> 03:48:19,161
LAURA: We took too long.

2788
03:48:19,161 --> 03:48:20,712
MATT: It's all good.

2789
03:48:20,712 --> 03:48:22,850
TALIESIN: This got wonderfully bad.

2790
03:48:22,850 --> 03:48:27,554
LIAM: I'm going to forget by next week. Is Scanlan
walking toward him, or had Scanlan gotten right

2791
03:48:27,554 --> 03:48:28,656
next to him?

2792
03:48:28,656 --> 03:48:32,346
MATT: Scanlan stepped out of the door and walked
out just enough-- Scanlan is probably ten feet

2793
03:48:32,346 --> 03:48:39,636
from the door, there, right behind him, just
emerged from the doorway. He's about ten feet from

2794
03:48:39,636 --> 03:48:46,626
Scanlan, and 15 from-- Correct. I'll set up
the arrangement for next week. I'll put something

2795
03:48:46,626 --> 03:48:50,395
together for you guys so you know what we're going
to start with next week. But yeah, we're going to

2796
03:48:50,395 --> 03:48:56,600
jump in, next Thursday, into a mid-street City of
Brass battle.

2797
03:48:56,600 --> 03:48:58,312
LIAM: Sextuplets!

2798
03:48:58,312 --> 03:49:01,878
SAM: Vex, Vax, Vax, Vex, Vex, and Vax!

2799
03:49:01,878 --> 03:49:08,091
MATT: Here's the one thing I'm going to leave you
with, because I feel this is important. As soon as

2800
03:49:08,091 --> 03:49:15,830
you guys watch this slight dissipation of arcane
energy splash across the torso and head of the pit

2801
03:49:15,830 --> 03:49:22,902
fiend, and it steps onto its back foot, and you
all realize this is the Jenga moment. As you're

2802
03:49:22,902 --> 03:49:30,250
preparing to go into combat, you watch as the pit
fiend narrows its eyes and, from immediately to

2803
03:49:30,250 --> 03:49:39,233
its left, a small, localized gateway tears open
and out from it you watch a humanoid female with

2804
03:49:39,233 --> 03:49:46,711
large, red, feathered wings, carrying some sort of
glowing lasso or rope at her side, armor, and a

2805
03:49:46,711 --> 03:49:55,019
large weapon, with a bow slung across her
shoulder, flies out next to the pit fiend. "You rang?"

2806
03:49:55,019 --> 03:49:56,853
LAURA: Aw, fuck.

2807
03:49:56,853 --> 03:49:58,465
MATT: And <i>that's</i> where we'll pick up next week.

2808
03:49:58,465 --> 03:50:00,680
LAURA: We're doomed.

2809
03:50:00,680 --> 03:50:08,969
MATT: So, we'll see you guys next week. Thank you
very much. Thank you, Ashley, for coming and

2810
03:50:08,969 --> 03:50:09,969
playing.

2811
03:50:09,969 --> 03:50:12,909
ASHLEY: I won't be here next week.

2812
03:50:12,909 --> 03:50:16,399
MATT: You won't be here next week? Aw, you're
filming Thursday? Aw.

2813
03:50:16,399 --> 03:50:19,302
LIAM: What you going to be working on?

2814
03:50:19,302 --> 03:50:23,299
ASHLEY: I don't know. Stuffs and stuffs.

2815
03:50:23,299 --> 03:50:25,328
TRAVIS: Yay, Pike!

2816
03:50:25,328 --> 03:50:28,274
MARISHA: We'll get you that armor!

2817
03:50:28,274 --> 03:50:37,104
MATT: Well, guys, thank you very much. Have a good
night, rest well. Thank you, Loot Crate. Is it

2818
03:50:37,104 --> 03:50:39,516
Thursday yet? See you guys soon.

2819
03:50:39,516 --> 03:57:40,354
