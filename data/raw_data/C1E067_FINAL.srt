1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,570
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,588
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

3
00:00:06,588 --> 00:00:07,975
LIAM: I take offense at that!

4
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:11,043
MATT: Yep. Welcome to the chaos.

5
00:00:11,043 --> 00:00:12,425
TALIESIN: We're cool.

6
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:15,678
MATT: Well, you guys are cool. I'm still working on
it.

7
00:00:15,678 --> 00:00:18,661
LAURA: You're in that picture too, Matthew.

8
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:21,502
MATT: I am, but of all the people in that picture,
I think I needed the most work.

9
00:00:21,502 --> 00:00:24,450
TRAVIS: Oh, come on! Get out of here!

10
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,083
LIAM: Loser contest, loser contest! I am the
biggest loser!

11
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:35,802
MATT: Hey guys, I'm the one with Critical Tape
tonight, so. Critical Tape on our fantastic sconce

12
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:42,688
there. Spare no expense. Anyway. So before we go
ahead and jump in tonight, I want to give a big

13
00:00:42,688 --> 00:00:48,043
thanks and Sam's going to back me up on this for
our sponsor for tonight's episode, Backblaze.

14
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:51,199
(cheering)

15
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,996
MATT: Sam, why don't you tell us all about that,
please?

16
00:00:52,996 --> 00:00:59,350
SAM: Guys, I'm a little disappointed tonight,
because I prepared an epic presentation tonight.

17
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:05,383
It was multimedia, there were song elements, there
were rhyming-verse sonnets, I wrote a great poem

18
00:01:05,383 --> 00:01:10,630
about how Backblaze is unlimited and you can get
it for just five dollars a month, about how it

19
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:16,492
backs up-- you get all your data anywhere in the
world, on the web or on your phones, and you can

20
00:01:16,492 --> 00:01:22,515
get a full-featured preview of it by going to
backblaze.com/criticalrole, I wrote all this stuff

21
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:28,630
down on my laptop, but my laptop had a
catastrophic hard drive failure today, and I didn't

22
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:35,097
back it up with Backblaze. And this is what I'm
talking about, guys, this is my art that I made,

23
00:01:35,097 --> 00:01:39,432
my art, there was a whole piece about you that
would've brought you to tears, you'll never get to

24
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,471
hear any of it.

25
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:41,988
TRAVIS: What about me?

26
00:01:41,988 --> 00:01:46,398
SAM: There was nothing about you. But it was
beautiful artwork that I made that you'll never

27
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:52,286
get to hear. However, I do remember one little
piece of it. I wrote this song, from scratch,

28
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:57,866
about Backblaze. It's an original piece not based
on any Broadway musical, and it goes like this:

29
00:01:57,866 --> 00:02:16,908
(singing) 525,600 fanfics, 525,000 doodles of
Grog, 525,000 nudies of Percleth, how do you back

30
00:02:16,908 --> 00:02:31,345
up a Critter's hard drive? How about Backblaze!
How about Backblaze! Sam wrote this song.

31
00:02:31,345 --> 00:02:32,575
Okay, good, that's it.

32
00:02:32,575 --> 00:02:34,033
(cheering)

33
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:40,330
TRAVIS: Oh, so in love with you right now.
Backblaze never sounded so good. Holy shit.

34
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:46,441
MATT: Let's have a very, very brief moment of
silence for your hard drive. Thank you, that was

35
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:48,003
great. All right.

36
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:51,916
TRAVIS: My musical boner for you is super rigid
right now.

37
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:56,464
SAM: Oh yeah? You would be even more hard if you
knew that I was talking to Lin-Manuel today.

38
00:02:56,464 --> 00:02:57,781
LAURA and TRAVIS: (gasp)

39
00:02:57,781 --> 00:03:00,327
LAURA: No you were not. Is that part of
announcements?

40
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:03,200
SAM: No, that's just a little humblebrag.

41
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,457
LAURA: You mother-- wow.

42
00:03:07,457 --> 00:03:09,675
SAM: We should probably run that intro, right?

43
00:03:09,675 --> 00:03:12,344
MATT: Yeah, in just a second.

44
00:03:12,344 --> 00:03:13,958
LAURA: So we can hear about it!

45
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,456
TRAVIS: You're full of shit, right?

46
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:23,720
MATT: All right, other announcements, I wanted to
say real fast, it got posted in the Anime Florida

47
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:30,567
convention that's this weekend, I did say unfortunately I
had to cancel on the event due to personal

48
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:33,952
reasons. I'm sorry I can't be there, but they have
a lot of great guests. Please go, have fun, check

49
00:03:33,952 --> 00:03:36,276
it out, it's going to be great. I'm going to make
it up to you guys, since there are thankfully

50
00:03:36,276 --> 00:03:39,823
plenty of conventions in Florida throughout the
year, so I plan to be out there really soon and

51
00:03:39,823 --> 00:03:46,085
will get a chance to make it up to you guys in
person. Anyway. Sorry about that. Much love, and

52
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:52,169
let's get into this episode. So everyone ready?
Everyone set? We had a few levels, actually. We

53
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:55,239
had Vex, Vax, Grog, and Keyleth, all hit level
15.

54
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:57,787
SAM: Whoa. What's up with us?

55
00:03:57,787 --> 00:03:59,006
TALIESIN: I don't know.

56
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,406
MARISHA: We're gods now.

57
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,099
TRAVIS: I'm the smartest man alive.

58
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,025
MARISHA: I have my 8th-level spell.

59
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:05,724
LAURA: (gasps) Do you really?

60
00:04:05,724 --> 00:04:06,855
MARISHA: Yeah I do.

61
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:09,896
LAURA: Can we know what you took? No, that's got
to be a surprise.

62
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:11,565
MARISHA: I get them all.

63
00:04:11,565 --> 00:04:13,519
LAURA: Oh, you don't have to choose?

64
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,842
MATT: Well, she has to choose at the beginning of
each day.

65
00:04:16,842 --> 00:04:18,545
LAURA: Fucking rangers.

66
00:04:18,545 --> 00:04:20,028
LIAM: I multiclassed into monk.

67
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:21,443
LAURA: No you didn't.

68
00:04:21,443 --> 00:04:25,550
I took the second level in rogue, though.

69
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,040
SAM: Oh yeah? Do you get a rogue spell?

70
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,021
LAURA: I don't get any rogue spells, but I do get
to disengage now.

71
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,331
MARISHA: You so sneaky.

72
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:34,496
TRAVIS: And she gets to sleep with barbarians
whenever she wants.

73
00:04:34,496 --> 00:04:35,769
SAM: Ew.

74
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:37,863
(laughter)

75
00:04:37,863 --> 00:04:40,999
TALIESIN: Somehow no new information, yet still
TMI.

76
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:46,222
MATT: And on that note, let's dive into tonight's
episode of Critical Role.

77
00:04:46,222 --> 00:06:17,374
[dramatic music]

78
00:06:17,374 --> 00:06:22,803
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. So. Last time we
left off, Vox Machina, in their attempt to gain

79
00:06:22,803 --> 00:06:27,119
power through artifacts called the Vestiges of
Divergence, to eventually destroy the Chroma

80
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:32,777
Conclave, great evil dragons that came together to
terrorize the Tal'Dorei countryside, they were

81
00:06:32,777 --> 00:06:40,576
seeking one in the country-- continent of Marquet,
the city of Ank'harel. After traveling there and

82
00:06:40,576 --> 00:06:45,732
meeting with members of the various
establishments, the new culture they were

83
00:06:45,732 --> 00:06:57,346
introduced to, a drug deal gone awry, some time in
a casino, some hookah excursions and some terrible

84
00:06:57,346 --> 00:07:06,543
alcohol purchases, they found themselves finding
an ally in the current head and for the past 400

85
00:07:06,543 --> 00:07:13,629
years the head of the city of Ank'harel known as
J'mon Sa Ord. They gave the party their allegiance

86
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:18,875
in this endeavor against the Conclave and
presented them with a brass flute that apparently

87
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:28,830
can at least notify that the aid is required.
After which the party spent the evening in their

88
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,915
tavern after the casino incident and then went
searching for this individual, this Mistress

89
00:07:33,915 --> 00:07:40,450
Asharu who apparently has the Cabal's Ruin, this
next Vestige in your journey. Upon checking in her

90
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:46,531
house after having no response for a couple days,
you broke inside to find that the home had been

91
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:55,126
attacked as of a week ago, her body left behind,
apparently riddled with puncture wounds, seemingly

92
00:07:55,126 --> 00:08:01,882
bullet holes after your inspection, Percy, and
Cabal's Ruin, the cloak that you were seeking, is

93
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:10,402
gone. And that is where we left off. So. Diving
back in, you've had the information synced to you

94
00:08:10,402 --> 00:08:17,447
that Mistress Asharru's been destroyed, Cabal's
Ruin is gone. You went and checked out the small

95
00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:23,281
back exit that led to one of the other streets of
the city, essentially another way out of the

96
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:27,538
house. That's all the information you have right
now, and you're all trying to wrap your head

97
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:31,110
around what just happened and what the next steps
are. What do you want to do?

98
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,450
LAURA: We're still in the house?

99
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,879
MATT: You're still in the house, yes.

100
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:43,190
LAURA: I'm a little nervous that the trap that
went off on the front door was an alarm system.

101
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,421
SAM: Sure.

102
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:45,814
LAURA: For whoever left.

103
00:08:45,814 --> 00:08:47,198
TALIESIN: It might be.

104
00:08:47,198 --> 00:08:48,683
TRAVIS: With the cloak?

105
00:08:48,683 --> 00:09:00,316
SAM: Or it could've been Cloaky's alarm system
that means that whoever killed Cloaky got in

106
00:09:00,316 --> 00:09:02,085
through not the front door.

107
00:09:02,085 --> 00:09:04,391
LAURA: Yeah, but we saw a trail of blood leading
to the front door.

108
00:09:04,391 --> 00:09:08,242
SAM: That was her trying to get out after she was
stabbed to death, right? No?

109
00:09:08,242 --> 00:09:11,240
LAURA: No, I think it was the blood from--

110
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,443
TRAVIS: Yeah, otherwise she walked back in her
individual footsteps and then laid down.

111
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:18,215
SAM: You're right, that is better detective work
than mine.

112
00:09:18,215 --> 00:09:23,425
LAURA: I think. I mean, I think that it was--

113
00:09:23,425 --> 00:09:31,398
SAM: But how'd they get out without-- so whoever
the murderer is set the trap as he/she was

114
00:09:31,398 --> 00:09:32,407
leaving.

115
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:34,405
TRAVIS: The murderer who's shooting bullets.

116
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:39,945
LIAM: Is there anything gained by discussing this
here? Do we need to look any further, or should we

117
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:41,463
get the hell out?

118
00:09:41,463 --> 00:09:45,246
TALIESIN: One last quick glance around the room to
see if there's anything helpful.

119
00:09:45,246 --> 00:09:47,451
MARISHA: Percy, can I see your gun?

120
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:50,111
TALIESIN: I hand it to her without even thinking
about it.

121
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:52,976
MARISHA: I inspect--

122
00:09:52,976 --> 00:09:54,867
TALIESIN: (gasps) You're a genius.

123
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:56,844
MATT: Make an investigation check.

124
00:09:56,844 --> 00:09:59,690
MARISHA: (sighs) I'm so bad at these.

125
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,513
MATT: What are you trying to find?

126
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:06,760
MARISHA: I want to see if there's a gem or device
on it, like a tracking device.

127
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,469
MATT: Sure, go for it.

128
00:10:08,469 --> 00:10:11,209
TALIESIN: I'd be very impressed if there was.

129
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:13,517
MARISHA: Oh, shit. 20.

130
00:10:13,517 --> 00:10:20,127
MATT: 20. You inspect the gun, and the gun, almost
like a pearled handle in a weapon, has whitestone

131
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:25,798
inlay and certain portions of the actual weapon
contain pockets of whitestone. Upon getting closer

132
00:10:25,798 --> 00:10:32,456
to it and-- you're perturbed as she begins to
inspect closely and you see her face open up with

133
00:10:32,456 --> 00:10:38,145
reaction. It's probably been a while since you've
missed a detail that Keyleth picked up on your own

134
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:51,677
item. There is a very, very faint magical aura on
the piece of whitestone that's underneath the main

135
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:59,903
set of barrels on the front, and there is-- the
carved signature of Ripley across the bottom does

136
00:10:59,903 --> 00:11:02,291
give off a faint magical glow.

137
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,161
LAURA: She's been fucking tracking us?

138
00:11:04,161 --> 00:11:06,099
LIAM: What're you looking at there, Keyleth?

139
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:07,747
TRAVIS: Oh, no.

140
00:11:07,747 --> 00:11:11,064
MARISHA: I think Percy was right. I think she has
been spying on us.

141
00:11:11,064 --> 00:11:15,375
TRAVIS: Well, Scanlan, throw it in the acid.

142
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,161
(laughter)

143
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:20,486
SAM: Better give me the gun.

144
00:11:20,486 --> 00:11:24,729
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I can use this,
if it's--

145
00:11:24,729 --> 00:11:28,085
SAM: Can you reverse lookup on the telephone?

146
00:11:28,085 --> 00:11:30,514
MARISHA: Yeah, I can scry through it.

147
00:11:30,514 --> 00:11:33,913
TALIESIN: You can scry?

148
00:11:33,913 --> 00:11:37,156
MARISHA: And she was very attached to it, which
means it should work pretty well.

149
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:40,832
MATT: In theory, you can scry on anybody that
you've met as well, as long as you know about them.

150
00:11:40,832 --> 00:11:44,302
MARISHA: I've also met her, so that helps.

151
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:48,755
MATT: I would give that a bonus to the actual
roll.

152
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:51,242
TRAVIS: I agree with what Vax is going to say, we
should move.

153
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:54,088
LIAM: Yeah, if anyone wants to roll this place, do
it, and let's get out of here.

154
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:59,486
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a quick look around,
quickly, quickly. Investigation, or? It doesn't

155
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:00,851
matter, that was a terrible roll.

156
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:02,229
MATT: What are you looking for?

157
00:12:02,229 --> 00:12:07,858
TALIESIN: Clues, objects, I'm basically doing the
standard police tumble. I'm tossing the place.

158
00:12:07,858 --> 00:12:09,774
MATT: What'd you roll?

159
00:12:09,774 --> 00:12:11,671
TALIESIN: I rolled a nine.

160
00:12:11,671 --> 00:12:18,836
MATT: A nine. You angrily begin throwing things
around the room in a fit. But you're so unfocused in

161
00:12:18,836 --> 00:12:24,901
your search, it's less about the actual search and
more about the frustration that this bypassed your

162
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:28,997
attention for so long, and you guys watch as Percy
begins to throw the bed to the side and go through

163
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:32,169
and start shoving stuff off of counters, and he's
not really looking for anything, he's just trying

164
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,871
to deal with his pent-up frustration.

165
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:39,443
MARISHA: Percy. We should go. This isn't helping
anything.

166
00:12:39,443 --> 00:12:46,503
TALIESIN: Yes. Yes. Yes. Better to do that in here
than outside. Secret passage?

167
00:12:46,503 --> 00:12:51,711
LIAM: Yeah, it's this way. I think I checked for
traps last--

168
00:12:51,711 --> 00:12:54,113
LAURA: Because you already went up to the top.

169
00:12:54,113 --> 00:12:55,983
LIAM: Yeah. I went all the way to the top and
peeked around.

170
00:12:55,983 --> 00:13:00,159
MATT: Yeah, there were no traps and you managed to
make it through below the small--

171
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:06,225
LIAM: I had a look around. Is it public, or off to
the side?

172
00:13:06,225 --> 00:13:11,510
MATT: It's a small alley that leads into an open
public space, so as long as you listen out for

173
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,448
anybody in the vicinity, you can--

174
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:15,061
LIAM: I'm going to scurry up, open up--

175
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:20,860
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a perception check.

176
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,647
LIAM: 20. No, 22.

177
00:13:22,647 --> 00:13:29,650
MATT: 22. Okay. You go up these small handholds as
you go up to the top, and there's a little bit of

178
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:36,418
a grate that's pushed there, you push it open, and
the metal circle plops on the side. You find that

179
00:13:36,418 --> 00:13:41,190
there's actually a piece of thin cloth that's
covering it as you push it over, and you listen up

180
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:47,410
for a second. You hear the bustle on the outside
of the city, but you do not notice anyone paying

181
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,895
attention to it, and you use the right moment to
dart up and you begin taking watch for the

182
00:13:50,895 --> 00:13:51,918
rest of the party.

183
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:55,041
LIAM: I'm off to the side like Marion in Raiders,
to the side of the alley.

184
00:13:55,041 --> 00:14:01,729
LAURA: Before I leave the room, can I check to see
if it seems like Ripley was alone or if there were

185
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:02,872
other people?

186
00:14:02,872 --> 00:14:07,223
MATT: Make a survival check.

187
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:08,766
LAURA: Natural 20.

188
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:11,162
TRAVIS: First one of the night.

189
00:14:11,162 --> 00:14:15,120
MATT: While you guys are having this conversation,
Vex is occasionally chiming in this whole time,

190
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,263
but is also keeping a very close eye on her own
mental layout of how the actual scuffle happened,

191
00:14:20,263 --> 00:14:24,929
looking for signs of impact. You actually follow
the footprints where someone smeared in the blood

192
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:29,755
and tracked it up. There are varying foot sizes in
some of the tracks you can see pressed in the

193
00:14:29,755 --> 00:14:34,154
dust, and there was a layer of dust down here
within certain areas because portions of the room

194
00:14:34,154 --> 00:14:41,027
are not often trekked. In fact, you see from the
general dust that's settled, there's a track from

195
00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:44,495
the bed to a couple of shelves to the table and
the exit, and you get the idea that Mistress

196
00:14:44,495 --> 00:14:51,987
Asharru, being as trained as she was, she had a
pattern and outside that pattern that she walked,

197
00:14:51,987 --> 00:14:55,998
there is a pretty heavy layer of dust that
gathered in those areas of the room, and those

198
00:14:55,998 --> 00:15:00,924
areas had been disturbed in some ways, and you
gather based on the footprints that are there,

199
00:15:00,924 --> 00:15:05,794
there were at least five or six people in the room
when this went down.

200
00:15:05,794 --> 00:15:08,097
LIAM: Terminator overlay.

201
00:15:08,097 --> 00:15:14,524
LAURA: All right. Grog?

202
00:15:14,524 --> 00:15:15,448
TRAVIS: Yeah?

203
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,279
LAURA: Can I have some of that Dust of
Tracelessness?

204
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,725
TRAVIS: What, are you going to mix it with some
spice and get high?

205
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:21,180
LAURA: Definitely.

206
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,474
TRAVIS: Yup, here you go.

207
00:15:22,474 --> 00:15:26,955
LAURA: Can I sprinkle it around so that they can't
track us in the room, having been here?

208
00:15:26,955 --> 00:15:31,614
MATT: Yeah. And as you throw around the dust, all
the tracks, everything that gave a sign of the

209
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:36,458
previous invaders, vanishes slowly as the dust
begins to cover the entirety of the floor, and as

210
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:40,400
you guys leave the same. It looks weirdly
undisturbed other than the body lying there with

211
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,525
now no actual ability to track how it got there.

212
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:49,807
SAM: That's tampering with evidence. That's a
definite felony.

213
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:54,093
LAURA: Definitely. Not as bad a felony as shoving
spice up your ass, but...

214
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:59,318
SAM: I don't know what you're talking about. That
was a scientific experiment.

215
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:04,052
LIAM: It was fucking awesome. Are we getting out
of here, or are we going to get out of here?

216
00:16:04,052 --> 00:16:05,875
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes.

217
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:12,762
MATT: Okay. You all eventually make your way to the end
of the secret tunnel, Vax leads you up at times when it's

218
00:16:12,762 --> 00:16:17,244
least likely to be noticed in the alleyway, and
eventually you all make yourselves up into the

219
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:21,871
top, close off the entrance, and then are hiding
off, and then carefully, nonchalantly make your

220
00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:26,182
way into the main thoroughfare up here. And it
isn't a large street, it's one of the secondary

221
00:16:26,182 --> 00:16:30,153
side-streets. Occasionally you have a person that
comes by with a large cart, or a couple people

222
00:16:30,153 --> 00:16:35,638
walking arm-in-arm, but no one seems to pay any
attention or notice your alleyway entry, and you

223
00:16:35,638 --> 00:16:39,800
have successfully obscured yourself within the
rest of the denizens of Ank'harel.

224
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,608
TALIESIN: Can you find her without her knowing?

225
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:48,941
MARISHA: I mean, all magic has a risk factor
depending on--

226
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,931
SAM: We have to look. Otherwise we have no leads
at all.

227
00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:53,769
LIAM: Let's head back to the Debt's Respite.

228
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:56,456
LAURA: And get ready to leave, because we can't
hang around--

229
00:16:56,456 --> 00:16:58,826
TALIESIN: Talk to her employer so they know it
wasn't us.

230
00:16:58,826 --> 00:17:03,765
SAM: Wait, wait. Should we not scry from a
different place than the place we're staying at?

231
00:17:03,765 --> 00:17:05,787
TALIESIN: It's the place that she knows we are
already.

232
00:17:05,787 --> 00:17:07,023
TRAVIS: True.

233
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:09,716
TALIESIN: She knows exactly where we're standing
anywhere we're holding the bloody gun.

234
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:13,696
TRAVIS: And when we do, we should set a little
ambush in case it sets off any alarms.

235
00:17:13,696 --> 00:17:16,001
LAURA: Can she hear us? When you scry, can you
hear?

236
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:21,138
SAM: Yeah, you can.

237
00:17:21,138 --> 00:17:27,034
MARISHA: I can hear, but I don't think they can
hear me. It's like looking through a little

238
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:28,310
window.

239
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,472
LAURA: Yeah, so if we're talking about her right
now, she can hear--

240
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:34,688
MARISHA: I don't know how this runic magic works
on his gun.

241
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:39,007
MATT: Yeah, you're not sure what the actual
enchantment is. It's subtle.

242
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:42,342
MARISHA: This is something different than what I
would be doing.

243
00:17:42,342 --> 00:17:46,383
LIAM: I grab Keyleth's hand and pull the gun over
and say, but for now, we assume she can hear

244
00:17:46,383 --> 00:17:48,279
everything that we are saying.

245
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:49,552
TRAVIS: Ripley's a piece of shit.

246
00:17:49,552 --> 00:17:50,983
LAURA: You're a piece of shit. You're ugly.

247
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:53,174
LIAM: Percival's going to fucking murder you.

248
00:17:53,174 --> 00:17:57,007
MARISHA: You're not that ugly. She just meant that
to hurt your feelings.

249
00:17:57,007 --> 00:17:59,573
TRAVIS: Keyleth, don't soften the blow. She's a
piece of shit.

250
00:17:59,573 --> 00:18:01,417
MARISHA: But you are a piece of shit.

251
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:02,539
TRAVIS: Nice job.

252
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,539
(laughter)

253
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:09,801
SAM: It's The Wire. Except terrible.

254
00:18:09,801 --> 00:18:13,807
MATT: Omar's challenge rating 30.

255
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:19,011
MARISHA: Was Ripley a magic-user, did she ever
engage in magic?

256
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:22,064
TALIESIN: Not that I really was aware. I didn't
know her that well.

257
00:18:22,064 --> 00:18:28,760
SAM: We know that she used some magic. She
disguised her hand with some illusion spell.

258
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,304
TALIESIN: Nothing complex.

259
00:18:32,304 --> 00:18:38,695
MATT: She disguised her hand, she also a short
distance seemingly teleported or managed to break

260
00:18:38,695 --> 00:18:42,803
away from you guys and Trinket to make
her escape.

261
00:18:42,803 --> 00:18:48,411
TRAVIS: If she's anything like you, she might've
paid someone to magically upgrade it for her.

262
00:18:48,411 --> 00:18:50,343
TALIESIN: She is like me.

263
00:18:50,343 --> 00:18:53,992
LIAM: She's also potentially listening to us right
now, I mean, time is of the essence.

264
00:18:53,992 --> 00:18:56,456
TALIESIN: Let's head back to the tavern.

265
00:18:56,456 --> 00:19:02,803
MATT: Okay, you guys make your way back to the
Debt's Respite. You head back up to your rooms,

266
00:19:02,803 --> 00:19:07,057
and you have a relative private space to go ahead
and discuss the next portion of your plan.

267
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:09,486
SAM: Do we leave the gun outside the room?

268
00:19:09,486 --> 00:19:12,171
TALIESIN: We have more than one room, right?

269
00:19:12,171 --> 00:19:13,472
MATT: You have three rooms.

270
00:19:13,472 --> 00:19:15,755
TALIESIN: Can we leave the gun with Trinket in the
other room?

271
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:19,545
MARISHA: I don't know if he's qualified to handle
firearms.

272
00:19:19,545 --> 00:19:22,464
TALIESIN: That's precisely why I want to leave the
gun with Trinket in the other room.

273
00:19:22,464 --> 00:19:26,715
LAURA: He won't shoot it. He'll sit on it. Is there
a safety?

274
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:29,222
TALIESIN: It's not loaded, it's all right.

275
00:19:29,222 --> 00:19:31,223
SAM: You could always put it in the Bag of
Holding.

276
00:19:31,223 --> 00:19:33,356
LIAM: I mean, Percival, be sure there's nothing in
the gun, please.

277
00:19:33,356 --> 00:19:36,103
TALIESIN: It's so complex to make it work, it's
fine.

278
00:19:36,103 --> 00:19:38,959
MARISHA: If Trinket shoots himself in the ass...

279
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:40,040
TALIESIN: It would be very funny, but--

280
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,248
LAURA: He won't.

281
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:43,351
TRAVIS: What do you want to do with it now? What's
the plan?

282
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:46,257
TALIESIN: We're going to leave it with Trinket in
the other room for the moment, and we're going to

283
00:19:46,257 --> 00:19:50,700
discuss things. Leaving it under the bed with a
bear in the room.

284
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,655
LAURA: Trinket, sit on the bed.

285
00:19:52,655 --> 00:19:54,876
MATT: (bear noises)

286
00:19:54,876 --> 00:20:00,940
LAURA: If anybody walks in the room that's not one
of us, well. Make them very scared and make sure they--

287
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,244
SAM: Shoot them with the gun.

288
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:03,952
LAURA: (laughs) Shoot them with the gun.

289
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:07,735
MATT: Licks the side of your face and gets back in
a restful period with the front of his paws and

290
00:20:07,735 --> 00:20:11,062
his head leaning over the edge of the bed, and the
bed itself is bowing under his weight.

291
00:20:11,062 --> 00:20:13,123
LAURA: Don't you fall asleep.

292
00:20:13,123 --> 00:20:18,990
MATT: All right, so you guys head to one of the
other rooms, then?

293
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,634
TRAVIS: Yeah.

294
00:20:20,634 --> 00:20:23,679
MATT: Okay. You guys close the door behind you.

295
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,585
TRAVIS: Should I keep watch outside?

296
00:20:26,585 --> 00:20:29,263
LIAM: Yeah, that's a good idea.

297
00:20:29,263 --> 00:20:31,819
TRAVIS: I'll stand watch outside.

298
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:34,320
MATT: And you do, Grog. This hallway is yours.

299
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,231
LAURA: Don't you fall asleep, Grog.

300
00:20:39,231 --> 00:20:42,686
TRAVIS: (snoring)

301
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:45,351
MATT: All right.

302
00:20:45,351 --> 00:20:53,424
TALIESIN: I think we need to tell her employer
that we are not responsible. As we were the last

303
00:20:53,424 --> 00:20:58,768
people to attempt to employ her, suspicion
automatically falls on us, and we need to let them

304
00:20:58,768 --> 00:21:01,833
know immediately that it was not us.

305
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:05,003
LIAM: All right. Should we scry now, though?

306
00:21:05,003 --> 00:21:14,003
MARISHA: I have to study and then sleep on it,
because that's how my process works.

307
00:21:14,003 --> 00:21:17,534
(laughter)

308
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:19,439
TALIESIN: Fucking method.

309
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:21,289
LAURA: Okay, yeah.

310
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:22,675
MATT: You do have an item.

311
00:21:22,675 --> 00:21:24,407
MARISHA: Oh my god! I have that thing you gave
me.

312
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:25,778
LAURA: The ball, yeah, that I gave you.

313
00:21:25,778 --> 00:21:27,029
TRAVIS: You have one ball?

314
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:28,708
LIAM: You have been holding out on us.

315
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,528
LAURA: Just the one ball, though.

316
00:21:30,528 --> 00:21:31,917
MARISHA: I have a secret.

317
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,265
SAM: Vax's face.

318
00:21:33,265 --> 00:21:44,620
LIAM: It's not necessarily a bad thing. Anything
is workable. Stupid.

319
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,406
TALIESIN: Bless you.

320
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:50,494
MARISHA: What is it that I got? I have a little
ball--

321
00:21:50,494 --> 00:21:52,196
LAURA: The ball of seeing. The ball of scrying.

322
00:21:52,196 --> 00:21:54,630
MARISHA: Scrying Eye! I have the Scrying Eye.

323
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,676
MATT: There you go.

324
00:21:55,676 --> 00:21:57,093
SAM: (singing) Scrying eyes--

325
00:21:57,093 --> 00:21:59,199
ALL: (singing) -- are watching you.

326
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:00,604
SAM: (singing) They see your...

327
00:22:00,604 --> 00:22:02,101
MATT: Anyone have the item card for the--

328
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:03,326
MARISHA: I have it.

329
00:22:03,326 --> 00:22:06,982
MATT: Oh, you do? Great. So yeah, it allows you to
basically do the equivalent of a scry spell once

330
00:22:06,982 --> 00:22:08,369
per day.

331
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:09,527
MARISHA: Once a day.

332
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:10,569
MATT: Yeah, all right.

333
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:11,922
MARISHA: Do we want to do this here?

334
00:22:11,922 --> 00:22:13,390
LIAM: I think as soon as possible.

335
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:17,761
TALIESIN: I think the question is, do we tell them
and see if we can enlist some help with this now

336
00:22:17,761 --> 00:22:19,009
or wait until after we know--

337
00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:20,220
SAM: Tell who?

338
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,766
MARISHA: I mean, this is going to take me ten
minutes. This is going to take me a second.

339
00:22:22,766 --> 00:22:26,027
SAM: Let's find out where she is. If she's still
in the city, we can maybe hunt her down and track

340
00:22:26,027 --> 00:22:27,186
her down today.

341
00:22:27,186 --> 00:22:30,995
TALIESIN: Do we get any help before we do that,
though? From her employers?

342
00:22:30,995 --> 00:22:33,477
LAURA: We'll talk to... Treev?

343
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,526
MARISHA: You guys figure it out, I'm going to
start scrying.

344
00:22:35,526 --> 00:22:42,003
TALIESIN: Figure out where she's going, what she's
doing, how many of them. All these things. I'm

345
00:22:42,003 --> 00:22:43,111
sorry.

346
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,720
LAURA: Percy, we'll find her.

347
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,071
TALIESIN: That's what I'm worried about.

348
00:22:48,071 --> 00:22:50,371
MATT: All right, so without the gun you don't get
the bonus from the item focus.

349
00:22:50,371 --> 00:22:51,356
MARISHA: Oh, fuck.

350
00:22:51,356 --> 00:22:53,232
MATT: But you also have the gun not in your
presence.

351
00:22:53,232 --> 00:22:57,687
MARISHA: Do we want to have the gun for this?
Actually, yeah. I'll do that. I'm going to go in

352
00:22:57,687 --> 00:22:59,724
the other room, grab the gun, and scry.

353
00:22:59,724 --> 00:23:02,998
LAURA: I'm going to go sit with you while you
scry.

354
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:05,920
MATT: Okay, you go into the room, and as you walk
toward the bed, Trinket growls at you.

355
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,504
LAURA: Trinket.

356
00:23:07,504 --> 00:23:13,097
TALIESIN: I have another option. I have another
option. We still have her notes. We still have her notes.

357
00:23:13,097 --> 00:23:15,312
MARISHA: Does anything help?

358
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:21,777
MATT: I mean, an object of which has some close
contact with the individual could help, yeah.

359
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:22,850
MARISHA: Sure, whatever.

360
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,741
TALIESIN: It is her diary notes of how to build my
gun.

361
00:23:24,741 --> 00:23:26,741
MATT: Yeah. You can use that instead, if you
wanted.

362
00:23:26,741 --> 00:23:28,318
LAURA: So we're not in the room with Trinket.

363
00:23:28,318 --> 00:23:29,603
MARISHA: Can I use both?

364
00:23:29,603 --> 00:23:31,390
MATT: They would not overlap.

365
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,520
MARISHA: Oh.

366
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,549
LAURA: Trinket, you keep doing your thing.

367
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:35,938
MATT: (bear noises)

368
00:23:35,938 --> 00:23:38,451
LAURA: All right, let's go back to the other room
and let's get something else to--

369
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:42,116
MARISHA: I don't know, what do you think would be
better, her notes or?

370
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:43,762
TALIESIN: Her notes. Let's be safe.

371
00:23:43,762 --> 00:23:45,448
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to use her notes.

372
00:23:45,448 --> 00:23:51,771
MATT: Okay. That will add five to the DC modifier.
So what's the DC of the spell?

373
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:55,691
MARISHA: My spell save DC is 19.

374
00:23:55,691 --> 00:24:01,431
MATT: All right, so now it's 24 to try and resist
this, as I throw my d20 into oblivion. Fuck that

375
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:03,365
dice. I didn't need it.

376
00:24:03,365 --> 00:24:05,759
LAURA: Do you want one? I have a bag.

377
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:11,811
MATT: You know, I'll use the big one, then, that
Chris Perkins gave me.

378
00:24:11,811 --> 00:24:13,646
TRAVIS: And thus ends Vox Machina.

379
00:24:13,646 --> 00:24:25,289
MATT: DM power. All right, then. This is now
Ripley's wisdom saving throw. Hm, okay.

380
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:26,737
TRAVIS: (laughs) Hm.

381
00:24:26,737 --> 00:24:28,616
LIAM: Interesting, interesting.

382
00:24:28,616 --> 00:24:31,029
LAURA: Does that dice go to dice jail?

383
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:41,454
MATT: No. As you sit down and focus, you take the
small object in your hand and concentrate with the

384
00:24:41,454 --> 00:24:45,867
notes in front of you, and you find that thread of
connection between your memory of Ripley, as fuzzy

385
00:24:45,867 --> 00:24:49,784
in some places as it is, you have a very clear
image of the moments you guys met in Whitestone.

386
00:24:49,784 --> 00:24:55,621
The notes, you connect those threads, focus on the
object, and then you guys watch as Keyleth's eyes

387
00:24:55,621 --> 00:25:02,240
dart open once again, clouded over and white. Your
vision pierces above. You can see your

388
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:09,419
consciousness thrust through the clouds, white
clouds passing by, passing by, and then your

389
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:13,730
vision comes back down through the clouds, only
instead of the desert, instead of the mountains,

390
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,973
instead of anything in the nearby area, it's just
ocean. Just ocean.

391
00:25:17,973 --> 00:25:20,012
LAURA: She's fucking finding another one.

392
00:25:20,012 --> 00:25:22,641
MATT: Waves seem endless around you.

393
00:25:22,641 --> 00:25:24,035
MARISHA: Oh no.

394
00:25:24,035 --> 00:25:28,065
MATT: You emerge once more, your vision moving
before, only now there's a torrential rain

395
00:25:28,065 --> 00:25:33,427
surrounding you, lightning, thunder clapping. You
are in the center of a very, very heavy storm that

396
00:25:33,427 --> 00:25:40,763
is tearing across this ocean expanse. A boat
creaks, ropes swing, and you hear voices yell. A

397
00:25:40,763 --> 00:25:47,215
crew barely holding it together. Standing on the
deck, hooded, you see Ripley, calm, and looking

398
00:25:47,215 --> 00:25:53,036
out into the horizon. She smiles from beneath her
dark leather cloak, a shimmer of blue energy dimly

399
00:25:53,036 --> 00:25:59,168
crackling across its inner lining. A voice yells,
"Nothing yet!" And her eyes dart up to the crow's

400
00:25:59,168 --> 00:26:05,165
nest, then back down to her weapon, a handheld
firearm of slick design, but familiar function.

401
00:26:05,165 --> 00:26:06,552
Six barrels.

402
00:26:06,552 --> 00:26:07,880
LIAM: Oh, snap.

403
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,284
MATT: Lightning flashes once more in the distance,
followed by a very, very nearby crack of thunder.

404
00:26:13,284 --> 00:26:19,091
The boat lists for a second as a wave passes under
it, and it catches itself again. She runs to the

405
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:23,985
deck to look out across the crashing waves, and
the vision fades back.

406
00:26:23,985 --> 00:26:25,811
LIAM: That was magical.

407
00:26:25,811 --> 00:26:29,293
TRAVIS: That was hot. That was hot.

408
00:26:29,293 --> 00:26:32,313
SAM: Is there any ocean in town?

409
00:26:32,313 --> 00:26:36,113
MARISHA: Bitch! She is a-- I grab the gun-- you
are a piece of shit!

410
00:26:36,113 --> 00:26:38,472
LAURA: I thought the gun was under the bed with
Trinket.

411
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:42,093
TALIESIN: You've literally just grabbed my hand
and are yelling into it.

412
00:26:42,093 --> 00:26:44,571
MARISHA: I'm sorry, I'm still a little fuzzy when
I come out of it.

413
00:26:44,571 --> 00:26:46,444
SAM: Make gun fingers, at least.

414
00:26:46,444 --> 00:26:52,376
LIAM: What's the matter, what's the matter? What
did you see?

415
00:26:52,376 --> 00:26:55,540
MARISHA: She's going after the other one, she's in
the middle of the fucking ocean.

416
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:59,041
SAM: So she's going for the other Vestige.
Whisper? Is that what's in the ocean?

417
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:03,506
LAURA: Whisper's in the ocean. The dagger. Fuck.

418
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:05,380
MARISHA: And she had the cloak.

419
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,508
SAM: And she knows everything that we know.

420
00:27:07,508 --> 00:27:08,996
TALIESIN: Do you know where she is?

421
00:27:08,996 --> 00:27:11,633
MARISHA: She's with a crew in the middle of the
ocean, so--

422
00:27:11,633 --> 00:27:14,654
LAURA: Can we instantly be in the middle of the
ocean with her?

423
00:27:14,654 --> 00:27:23,568
MARISHA: I can't get us there. There's no trees in
the middle of the ocean.

424
00:27:23,568 --> 00:27:25,455
TALIESIN: She's heading for an island, though.

425
00:27:25,455 --> 00:27:26,682
LAURA: Is she?

426
00:27:26,682 --> 00:27:28,946
LIAM: I thought it was beneath the waves.

427
00:27:28,946 --> 00:27:30,387
SAM: It's in the Ozmit Sea.

428
00:27:30,387 --> 00:27:31,772
LIAM: Yeah, beneath the Ozmit Sea.

429
00:27:31,772 --> 00:27:34,560
MARISHA: Scanlan, can you get us there?

430
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,677
SAM: I can make us all cows. That is about it.

431
00:27:38,677 --> 00:27:40,461
MARISHA: I mean, I can mist us.

432
00:27:40,461 --> 00:27:42,361
LAURA: Mist into the ocean?

433
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:44,093
MARISHA: We could mist there, but it would
take...

434
00:27:44,093 --> 00:27:49,952
SAM: (clears throat) Whisper, blade forged from
metal pulled from the Far Realm, was center to

435
00:27:49,952 --> 00:27:55,575
many dark rituals. Now it lies at the bottom of
the Ozmit Sea, sunken with the lost ship The Shrew

436
00:27:55,575 --> 00:28:01,538
in a storm 300 years ago, near an island... of trees.

437
00:28:01,538 --> 00:28:05,474
No, it's an island of grass. There's no trees on
the island.

438
00:28:05,474 --> 00:28:08,127
MARISHA: No, it's not even an island of grass,
it's an island of glass.

439
00:28:08,127 --> 00:28:10,333
SAM: Oh, glass! I can't read! (laughs)

440
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:12,795
TALIESIN: An island of glass trees.

441
00:28:12,795 --> 00:28:16,679
SAM: An island of grass.

442
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:21,372
LIAM: Ah, boy.

443
00:28:21,372 --> 00:28:23,577
SAM: Island of glass?

444
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:28,388
MARISHA: Yeah, which doesn't sound promising, to
be totally honest. So we might have to mist there.

445
00:28:28,388 --> 00:28:31,251
LIAM: How far away is--

446
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,725
SAM: It's continents, it would take weeks.

447
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:35,403
TRAVIS: Don't they have an airship here?

448
00:28:35,403 --> 00:28:39,864
MARISHA: Wait, the Water Ashari are in the Ozmit?

449
00:28:39,864 --> 00:28:42,012
MATT: They're in the Ozmit Sea, yes.

450
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:45,505
MARISHA: Do I know if they would be close by this
island of glass?

451
00:28:45,505 --> 00:28:52,476
MATT: I'm going to go ahead and have... let's see.
Scanlan, roll a history check? And if you could

452
00:28:52,476 --> 00:28:54,391
roll an intelligence check.

453
00:28:54,391 --> 00:28:56,000
MARISHA: Why is it always intelligence?

454
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,170
SAM: I've got a 15 history.

455
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,377
MARISHA: Oh my god. I rolled a natural one.

456
00:29:00,377 --> 00:29:03,921
MATT: You know it's in the Ozmit Sea, but you've
never been there, you don't know where it is, you

457
00:29:03,921 --> 00:29:06,393
have no idea what the actual space is there.

458
00:29:06,393 --> 00:29:08,399
MARISHA: We don't communicate.

459
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,836
MATT: You. Island of glass, and after thinking
about it hard, you're like, of course, it's the

460
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:14,666
Isle of Glintshore.

461
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:16,072
LAURA: Of course.

462
00:29:16,072 --> 00:29:28,296
MATT: It's part of a cluster of islands. You don't
know quite where it is, but you know of it. That's

463
00:29:28,296 --> 00:29:33,050
about all the information you have on it at the
moment. You don't know how far, the specific

464
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,880
direction really.

465
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,416
SAM: Well, it doesn't look like we can just
magically get to her.

466
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:41,063
TRAVIS: Ooh, ooh.

467
00:29:41,063 --> 00:29:42,440
LAURA: Yes, Grog?

468
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,579
TRAVIS: Aren't you two dweebs always wanting to
steal an airship?

469
00:29:45,579 --> 00:29:46,605
SAM and TALIESIN: Yes.

470
00:29:46,605 --> 00:29:47,640
TRAVIS: Don't they have one here?

471
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,829
SAM and TALIESIN: Yes.

472
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:52,129
TRAVIS: So... Do I have to say the third thing, or
are you going to get there?

473
00:29:52,129 --> 00:29:55,643
SAM: I would like to steal that airship, but even
then, though, it would take us a week.

474
00:29:55,643 --> 00:29:58,931
TALIESIN: It would take way too much time. We are
on a schedule.

475
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:02,017
TRAVIS: What? Road trip, bitches. Come on. We got
to like, you know--

476
00:30:02,017 --> 00:30:08,326
SAM: Okay, let's game this out. What's the
worse-case scenario? She has one Vestige. She may

477
00:30:08,326 --> 00:30:09,446
have two.

478
00:30:09,446 --> 00:30:10,985
LIAM: What's left after that?

479
00:30:10,985 --> 00:30:13,548
MARISHA: I mean, we could let her do the hard work
for us.

480
00:30:13,548 --> 00:30:20,339
LIAM: She has the cloak, that we know of. She's on
top of the dagger almost.

481
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:27,607
SAM: The Spire of Conflux, in the Abyssal Plane.
And the Plate of Dawnmartyr in the Elemental Plane

482
00:30:27,607 --> 00:30:31,386
of Fire. I mean, those are going to be super hard
to find, even for her.

483
00:30:31,386 --> 00:30:34,917
LIAM: I know, but if we're in an arms race and
she's on top of another, maybe we should head to

484
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,394
the next that's out of her reach now.

485
00:30:37,394 --> 00:30:38,497
TRAVIS: That makes sense.

486
00:30:38,497 --> 00:30:42,774
MARISHA: The staff is in the plane of the Abyss.

487
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:45,026
LAURA: That's a very scary place.

488
00:30:45,026 --> 00:30:49,767
TRAVIS: The only problem with that is she only has
one now and if she has two, she might be a bit

489
00:30:49,767 --> 00:30:50,649
harder--

490
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:54,315
LAURA: Especially, imagine if one of us was
wearing all of the Vestiges.

491
00:30:54,315 --> 00:30:58,134
SAM: She has people working for her, clearly.

492
00:30:58,134 --> 00:31:00,159
LAURA: She's not going to give it up.

493
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,384
SAM: No, but I mean it won't be her alone.

494
00:31:03,384 --> 00:31:06,906
LIAM: And we're not going to get there in time to
stop her from getting that dagger.

495
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:10,313
TALIESIN: But we might be able to take them from
her and perhaps even finally put her down before

496
00:31:10,313 --> 00:31:13,114
she puts more of those bloody things into the
world.

497
00:31:13,114 --> 00:31:15,117
MARISHA: Can I also ask another question, Percy?

498
00:31:15,117 --> 00:31:16,314
TALIESIN: Sure.

499
00:31:16,314 --> 00:31:20,021
MARISHA: Why does she want these Vestiges in the
first place? I have a feeling she doesn't want to

500
00:31:20,021 --> 00:31:21,118
fight dragons.

501
00:31:21,118 --> 00:31:24,107
SAM: She might want to join up with the dragons.

502
00:31:24,107 --> 00:31:26,347
MARISHA: Do you know?

503
00:31:26,347 --> 00:31:27,385
TALIESIN: I don't--

504
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,026
LIAM: I mean, there's many reasons to amass
power.

505
00:31:30,026 --> 00:31:34,711
LAURA: Could she be the one letting the dragons
know about-- could she be the spy?

506
00:31:34,711 --> 00:31:43,601
TALIESIN: I spent less than a week in her company
in my life. I know very little about her other

507
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:53,483
than-- I spent a week in her company and I spent I
don't know how much time trying to track her down

508
00:31:53,483 --> 00:32:02,575
and all I really know is she's very smart and she
is the worst person I've ever met.

509
00:32:02,575 --> 00:32:09,493
MARISHA: Why would you say that exactly? Because
we've met a lot of terrible people.

510
00:32:09,493 --> 00:32:10,651
SAM: Kevdak.

511
00:32:10,651 --> 00:32:11,829
TALIESIN: People don't frighten me.

512
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,438
MARISHA: Their dad.

513
00:32:13,438 --> 00:32:14,993
TALIESIN: He doesn't frighten me.

514
00:32:14,993 --> 00:32:19,980
MARISHA: Saundor was pretty shitty. Clarota.

515
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:24,235
SAM: Well, let's not rank the bad people we've
met.

516
00:32:24,235 --> 00:32:34,390
TALIESIN: I don't even know if she wants anything.
Maybe she wants nothing.

517
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:38,193
TRAVIS: Are you genuinely afraid of her?

518
00:32:38,193 --> 00:32:40,130
TALIESIN: Yes, very much so.

519
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,775
TRAVIS: Oh.

520
00:32:41,775 --> 00:32:45,038
LAURA: Fuck, why didn't we kill her when we had
her in our--

521
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:47,419
SAM: She got away. We tried.

522
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:57,750
TALIESIN: I made a terrible trade. I made the
wrong trade and I made a terrible decision. I know that.

523
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:02,080
(laughter)

524
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,650
TALIESIN: The table on the left is completely
incapable--

525
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,888
TRAVIS: The player on your right--

526
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,552
LIAM: A little mug interference.

527
00:33:13,552 --> 00:33:22,690
TALIESIN: Let me get this enchantment off my gun.
Let's find somebody who can pull it off and put it

528
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:28,660
onto something else and leave it here. And then
let's run screaming to this island and see if we

529
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:36,430
can catch her and if she's not there, we spend 24
hours where I will recount every desperate attempt

530
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:41,669
I have made to try and kill her in the last few
years of my life and then we head back and deal

531
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:45,006
with the other monstrosities that are waiting for
us back home.

532
00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:47,093
SAM: I don't know that we'll get there in time.

533
00:33:47,093 --> 00:33:48,755
LIAM: How do we get there?

534
00:33:48,755 --> 00:33:52,958
MARISHA: We had to fly across the Ozmit Sea to get
to Marquet.

535
00:33:52,958 --> 00:34:00,096
MATT: It took you about a week to get to
Vasselheim via skyship from Emon and that's

536
00:34:00,096 --> 00:34:08,951
normally a two-and-a-half week journey by boat.
You guys got to Marquet via your Transport Via

537
00:34:08,951 --> 00:34:12,302
Plants. Oh no, sorry, you got to Marquet via the
Teleportation Circle that--

538
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:14,181
MARISHA: Gilmore made for us.

539
00:34:14,181 --> 00:34:16,363
LAURA: Are we by the ocean at all?

540
00:34:16,363 --> 00:34:18,345
MARISHA: But the ocean's above us, right?

541
00:34:18,345 --> 00:34:23,848
MATT: You have a mountain range that is at the
top, the northern part of the desert, probably a

542
00:34:23,848 --> 00:34:29,590
day and a half of foot travel and the mountain
range, you're not sure how big that is. From what

543
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:35,420
you know of loose geography-- Scanlan, you
probably know this better than anybody-- that

544
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:42,131
Ank'Harel and this part of the desert is not too
far from the northern shore of Marquet, compared

545
00:34:42,131 --> 00:34:50,892
to the rest of it. The entire continent is like a
big U and this is the Ozmit Sea up here. This is

546
00:34:50,892 --> 00:34:53,754
Marquet. Ank'Harel's right there and then this is
the ocean.

547
00:34:53,754 --> 00:34:56,551
LAURA: Can Misty Step travel faster than a boat?

548
00:34:56,551 --> 00:35:02,051
MATT: Of an ocean boat? Yes, probably twice as
fast.

549
00:35:02,051 --> 00:35:05,869
LAURA: So if it took her a week to get where she
is now, we could probably get there--

550
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:09,266
TALIESIN: In three days. But where do you rest in
the--

551
00:35:09,266 --> 00:35:11,652
SAM: Yes. We'd have to rest in order to do Misty
Step--

552
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:15,413
LIAM: If your magic runs out while we're flying
over the ocean, what happens, we drown?

553
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:18,393
LAURA: We don't necessarily drown immediately.

554
00:35:18,393 --> 00:35:21,473
TALIESIN: Also, if we can find a way to teleport
to the island, if there's a way that we can.

555
00:35:21,473 --> 00:35:23,360
LIAM: But how?

556
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,963
SAM: We have one teleportation circle.

557
00:35:24,963 --> 00:35:26,992
MARISHA: I mean, I could teleport us--

558
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:28,498
LIAM: You have to have a circle to a circle.

559
00:35:28,498 --> 00:35:36,193
MARISHA: I could teleport us to the edge of the
continent, we could sleep, and then Misty Step

560
00:35:36,193 --> 00:35:37,899
lasts eight hours.

561
00:35:37,899 --> 00:35:39,341
MATT: Yeah. Wind Walk, you mean?

562
00:35:39,341 --> 00:35:40,606
MARISHA: Wind Walk, whatever.

563
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:43,408
MATT: It's a different spell, but yeah. It's 30
feet.

564
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:44,627
LIAM: That wouldn't do it.

565
00:35:44,627 --> 00:35:45,584
MATT: Little different.

566
00:35:45,584 --> 00:35:46,926
MARISHA: Wind Walk lasts eight hours.

567
00:35:46,926 --> 00:35:58,417
SAM: She's on a boat. She's not on a magic boat.
She can't magically get back to the shore without

568
00:35:58,417 --> 00:36:04,129
sailing there. If we sail out on an airship or a
boat--

569
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:05,912
LAURA: We could bomb her!

570
00:36:05,912 --> 00:36:10,431
SAM: Well yes! She's slow moving, she's on a boat,
it'll take her days to get wherever she's going,

571
00:36:10,431 --> 00:36:16,117
we need to find her, and we can keep scrying on
the airship, and catch up to her slowly, she's a

572
00:36:16,117 --> 00:36:18,051
slow moving target, even after she--

573
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,837
LIAM: I like that you're assuming we'll have an
airship.

574
00:36:19,837 --> 00:36:23,043
SAM: We don't right now, but we will soon.

575
00:36:23,043 --> 00:36:25,641
MARISHA: It could take us a while to even get the
airship.

576
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:29,478
SAM: Nope. One day. Me and Percy. Maybe two
hours.

577
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:35,135
TRAVIS: I actually agree with that strategy. It is
a bit like fish in a barrel because she is limited

578
00:36:35,135 --> 00:36:36,401
by her speed.

579
00:36:36,401 --> 00:36:38,283
LAURA: Will we be able to find her in the middle
of the ocean?

580
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:39,806
SAM: We can keep scrying from the airship.

581
00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:40,885
LIAM: That's true.

582
00:36:40,885 --> 00:36:42,020
TALIESIN: We can keep scrying.

583
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:46,962
TALIESIN: The first thing we have to do is remove
this enchantment and I'm very open to ideas on how

584
00:36:46,962 --> 00:36:47,864
to do that.

585
00:36:47,864 --> 00:36:52,476
TRAVIS: Wait, but play it out. How do we see where
she is in comparison to a giant body of water?

586
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:56,234
SAM: Well, we use what sailors do.

587
00:36:56,234 --> 00:36:57,634
TRAVIS: Look up at the stars?

588
00:36:57,634 --> 00:37:00,427
SAM: Up at the stars, right? We scry at night.

589
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:03,789
TRAVIS: We're looking at her, right, not up, can
we, like, go like that--

590
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:05,178
LAURA: No, you can scry up, yeah.

591
00:37:05,178 --> 00:37:07,550
MATT: Focused around the target of the scrying.

592
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,947
LIAM: Are either of you gentlemen smart enough to
do that?

593
00:37:09,947 --> 00:37:12,123
MARISHA: We can't tilt the camera up a little
bit?

594
00:37:12,123 --> 00:37:17,053
MATT: No. You can, but you'll see a blurred
skyline--

595
00:37:17,053 --> 00:37:22,384
SAM: We can listen for clues. Maybe the crew
members will shout out a, "Oh, we're at longitude

596
00:37:22,384 --> 00:37:25,865
"blah blah blah latitude blah blah blah!"

597
00:37:25,865 --> 00:37:30,018
MATT: For you, when you scry on something, imagine
it, like, super high depth of field, so like what

598
00:37:30,018 --> 00:37:34,579
you're looking at is super in-focus and most
everything else is very blurred and out of focus.

599
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:42,418
SAM: Okay, wait, to play this out a bit more: we
know where she's going. We know where Glintshore

600
00:37:42,418 --> 00:37:44,393
is roughly if we got a local--

601
00:37:44,393 --> 00:37:45,483
LIAM: Do you know where that island is?

602
00:37:45,483 --> 00:37:49,789
SAM: Well we can find a local who does. A sailor
or something who can help us navigate our way there.

603
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:51,410
LAURA: Maybe somebody in an airship.

604
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:55,365
TRAVIS: We could, but we might just be chasing, as
long as we're all right with that. We'll just be

605
00:37:55,365 --> 00:37:56,609
chasing.

606
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:59,482
LAURA: We'll keep scrying until we see if she's
found it.

607
00:37:59,482 --> 00:38:00,764
TALIESIN: Until we see a tree.

608
00:38:00,764 --> 00:38:05,010
TRAVIS: Vax does have a point, though. If we're
just chasing, we could get the jump on other ones.

609
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:09,671
TALIESIN: Here's the terrifying notion: if you see
a tree in any of your scries, can you teleport to it?

610
00:38:09,671 --> 00:38:10,880
MARISHA: Yes, I can.

611
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,684
TALIESIN: So as long as she gets next to a tree--

612
00:38:12,684 --> 00:38:14,449
SAM: I don't think she's getting next to a tree.

613
00:38:14,449 --> 00:38:15,767
MARISHA: She's in the middle of the ocean.

614
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:18,759
TALIESIN: Once she's on the island, if the island
has a tree...

615
00:38:18,759 --> 00:38:20,583
LAURA and LIAM: It's possible.

616
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:24,257
SAM: It was near. It was near the island of
glass.

617
00:38:24,257 --> 00:38:26,996
TALIESIN: We're going to be looking for her.
That's where I would set up shop if I were--

618
00:38:26,996 --> 00:38:31,349
LIAM: I mean, Percival is correct, the first thing
we have to do is get that gun unfucked, but then

619
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:35,397
after we have to decide if we are chasing her
down-- and it seems 50-50 to me, not impossible,

620
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:39,872
but not a sure thing at all-- or do we head to the
next Vestige to keep it out of her hands?

621
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,299
LAURA: Into the Plane of Abyss?

622
00:38:41,299 --> 00:38:44,073
LIAM: Well isn't that where we have to go anyway?

623
00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:47,507
TRAVIS: Let's get the gun unfucked, and we'll
simmer on it.

624
00:38:47,507 --> 00:38:55,450
SAM: Wait, before we get the gun unfucked, is
there any use to it being fucked? Like, can we

625
00:38:55,450 --> 00:39:01,126
have play-acting conversations around it like "Oh,
this is where we should go next, hope you're

626
00:39:01,126 --> 00:39:01,949
"listening!"

627
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:06,163
TALIESIN: That is deeply assuming that it actually
conveys sound, which it may not.

628
00:39:06,163 --> 00:39:10,210
MARISHA: Yeah, we have no idea what it actually
is, let's go get it.

629
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:14,870
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're going to have to move that
enchantment onto something else.

630
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:18,352
SAM: We can go to that place where-- back to the
asshole.

631
00:39:18,352 --> 00:39:20,402
TALIESIN: I know what he wants, no.

632
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:21,562
SAM: What does he want?

633
00:39:21,562 --> 00:39:22,599
LAURA: He wants whitestone.

634
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:23,837
SAM: So give him whitestone.

635
00:39:23,837 --> 00:39:24,729
TALIESIN: Absolutely not.

636
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:28,455
MARISHA: He's going to take one really close look
at that gun and see a lot of whitestone in it.

637
00:39:28,455 --> 00:39:30,864
TRAVIS: I got two chunks of whitestone in the Bag
of Holding.

638
00:39:30,864 --> 00:39:34,448
TALIESIN: He wants the green gems, and I'm not
prepared to make that deal.

639
00:39:34,448 --> 00:39:40,942
SAM: We can make him a fake one and give it to him
for one favor. We can make a fake gem, how hard is that?

640
00:39:40,942 --> 00:39:42,076
LAURA: He's going to know.

641
00:39:42,076 --> 00:39:44,426
TRAVIS: I got a bunch of gems in the Bag of
Holding.

642
00:39:44,426 --> 00:39:46,837
TALIESIN: It's not going to work.

643
00:39:46,837 --> 00:39:48,611
LAURA: Do you have green gems?

644
00:39:48,611 --> 00:39:50,092
TRAVIS: Gems, lots of gems.

645
00:39:50,092 --> 00:39:52,180
LAURA: No, but the green gems from Whitestone?

646
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:59,071
LIAM: Whitestone is much further away from the
Ozmit Sea than where we are now, right?

647
00:39:59,071 --> 00:40:02,808
MATT: Whitestone is <i>much</i> further away, yes.

648
00:40:02,808 --> 00:40:04,652
LIAM: Way, way, other side of the continent
right?

649
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,623
MATT: Across a vast ocean, and then across the
continent.

650
00:40:07,623 --> 00:40:18,149
SAM: One thing that occurred to me, that may not
help us at all. Mistress Asharru, the dead girl:

651
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:23,416
she was part of an organization?

652
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:24,561
TALIESIN: Yes.

653
00:40:24,561 --> 00:40:27,051
SAM: Maybe they would want to help us because of
revenge?

654
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:30,731
TALIESIN: Here's the question, and this is what
I've been thinking about sitting here for the last

655
00:40:30,731 --> 00:40:38,114
few minutes, is either way this is terrible:
either we don't tell them and leave town and

656
00:40:38,114 --> 00:40:43,662
eventually they find her and she's got strange
holes in her from some strange thing that could

657
00:40:43,662 --> 00:40:49,846
possibly be a thing that a man with white hair who
breezed through town a week ago was holding, or we

658
00:40:49,846 --> 00:40:56,859
go and tell them, and I cannot believe this is
about to come out of my mouth, that it wasn't me,

659
00:40:56,859 --> 00:41:00,077
it was a one armed woman, who had--

660
00:41:00,077 --> 00:41:01,572
SAM: A fugitive?

661
00:41:01,572 --> 00:41:08,271
TALIESIN: An identical, thank you, weapon, of this
one of a kind weapon that no one bloody saw.

662
00:41:08,271 --> 00:41:13,174
LAURA: No, but here's the thing, maybe somebody
did see her.

663
00:41:13,174 --> 00:41:17,119
TALIESIN: Maybe somebody did see her, and maybe
they'll know where to get the gun.

664
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:23,978
MARISHA: Even if they did see her, we know she
knows how to alter her appearance. Also, no

665
00:41:23,978 --> 00:41:29,182
offense Percy, but I feel like we need to be
careful on who you expose that gun to, from here

666
00:41:29,182 --> 00:41:30,051
on out.

667
00:41:30,051 --> 00:41:31,402
TALIESIN: I am keenly aware.

668
00:41:31,402 --> 00:41:37,160
MARISHA: Not only, one, for people who might think
you're the culprit, but two, for people who are

669
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,445
going to want to rip you off again.

670
00:41:39,445 --> 00:41:45,318
TALIESIN: She's the only person who's ever gotten
a good look at it. She's the only one.

671
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:54,263
SAM: So other than chasing her, going for the next
Vestige on the list, the third option is wish her

672
00:41:54,263 --> 00:41:58,965
good luck and continue on with our mission
ignoring the fact that she exists.

673
00:41:58,965 --> 00:42:00,632
MARISHA: Maybe she'll die in the Ozmit Sea.

674
00:42:00,632 --> 00:42:02,968
TALIESIN: She won't.

675
00:42:02,968 --> 00:42:04,791
LIAM: How long's it been since we left Draconia?

676
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:10,933
MATT: Five days?

677
00:42:10,933 --> 00:42:12,329
LAURA: Not five days?!

678
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:18,907
MATT: From your travel from Draconia, back to
Whitestone, to resting in Whitestone, heading from

679
00:42:18,907 --> 00:42:26,064
there to the southern city, then travelling from
there to Ank'Harel, then you've had--

680
00:42:26,064 --> 00:42:30,914
TALIESIN: A lot of that was instantaneous. We did
camp three or four days--

681
00:42:30,914 --> 00:42:34,916
MATT: Well no, yeah about four or five days
because you travelled then from Whitestone to

682
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:40,981
south of Ank'Harel, then you wind walked to
Ank'Harel, but then camped outside of Ank'Harel,

683
00:42:40,981 --> 00:42:45,675
because the time you got there was night, then you
made it into the city, then you stayed for the

684
00:42:45,675 --> 00:42:50,295
evening, you slept again and the next night you
went ahead and went into the casino, then slept

685
00:42:50,295 --> 00:42:52,604
the night there, so yeah, it's been about five
days.

686
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:58,750
MARISHA: Is it like a flying from east to west
thing where we gain back a day when we go back?

687
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,108
MATT: No.

688
00:43:00,108 --> 00:43:02,906
LAURA: But we don't have to fly, we just have to
teleport there.

689
00:43:02,906 --> 00:43:04,552
TALIESIN: So long as we teleport we're fine.

690
00:43:04,552 --> 00:43:12,008
LAURA: But we don't have a plan. We have five days
to figure out how to fucking kill a dragon. Oh Jesus.

691
00:43:12,008 --> 00:43:16,563
MARISHA: And we didn't get the Vestige we came
here for, so--

692
00:43:16,563 --> 00:43:18,302
TALIESIN: No we did not, in fact, it's worse.

693
00:43:18,302 --> 00:43:23,397
MATT: Well two weeks was the agreement, so you
have more than five. Nine.

694
00:43:23,397 --> 00:43:25,816
LIAM: You can do anything in nine days.

695
00:43:25,816 --> 00:43:28,776
TRAVIS: We don't even have to keep the agreement,
come on.

696
00:43:28,776 --> 00:43:33,236
LAURA: Potentially.

697
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:39,247
TRAVIS: Just saying. We getting the gun un-fucked
or what?

698
00:43:39,247 --> 00:43:41,278
TALIESIN: Let's go downstairs and talk to her
employer.

699
00:43:41,278 --> 00:43:42,391
LAURA: Treev?

700
00:43:42,391 --> 00:43:44,881
MATT: Treev, yes. All right.

701
00:43:44,881 --> 00:43:47,047
TALIESIN: I'm going to leave the gun upstairs
still.

702
00:43:47,047 --> 00:43:52,026
MARISHA: Wait, what? Don't we need it to tap the
gun to--

703
00:43:52,026 --> 00:43:53,821
SAM: Well we got to find out who's going to
un-fuck it.

704
00:43:53,821 --> 00:43:56,120
LAURA: Is Treev downstairs?

705
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:03,143
MATT: All right, you head down into the tavern,
and at this time of day it's a little empty, a

706
00:44:03,143 --> 00:44:09,014
little sparse, maybe like, four patrons. Two in
discussions, one that's deep in the cups and one

707
00:44:09,014 --> 00:44:14,045
in the midst of going through paperwork and in the
far back you see Treev once again has his heavy

708
00:44:14,045 --> 00:44:17,802
spectacles on and is currently looking through
that same book he was before, doesn't seem to pay

709
00:44:17,802 --> 00:44:19,574
any mind to you until you approach him.

710
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,242
LAURA: Treev?

711
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:25,977
MATT: "Oh, aye, good to see you. What can I do for
you?"

712
00:44:25,977 --> 00:44:29,656
LAURA: We need to talk to you. It's rather
urgent.

713
00:44:29,656 --> 00:44:36,908
MATT: "Then talk to me." Puts his book away,
glasses on it, leans forward.

714
00:44:36,908 --> 00:44:47,158
TALIESIN: There's been a complication. The
mistress is-- she's been assassinated.

715
00:44:47,158 --> 00:44:53,337
MARISHA: We hadn't heard anything in these past
few days, we decided to pay her a call.

716
00:44:53,337 --> 00:45:02,300
MATT: He leans forward a little bit on the bar.
Vex, Vax and Keyleth. You notice that the hooded

717
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,702
figure, that originally delivered the note, is
back in the far corner, where it was and it seems

718
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:09,033
to have stepped a couple inches out of the shadows as
well, paying very close attention to this

719
00:45:09,033 --> 00:45:10,418
conversation.

720
00:45:10,418 --> 00:45:12,704
TALIESIN: Did we bring the note with us? Good.

721
00:45:12,704 --> 00:45:18,079
MATT: Goes, "So you are saying that the mistress
was assassinated?"

722
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:19,689
TALIESIN: And the cloak stolen.

723
00:45:19,689 --> 00:45:21,488
MATT: "Cloak?"

724
00:45:21,488 --> 00:45:23,381
TALIESIN: The cloak she wore.

725
00:45:23,381 --> 00:45:27,036
MATT: "And you know this how?"

726
00:45:27,036 --> 00:45:28,757
LAURA: We found her body.

727
00:45:28,757 --> 00:45:31,681
MATT: "Where?"

728
00:45:31,681 --> 00:45:33,155
LAURA: In her home.

729
00:45:33,155 --> 00:45:34,816
SCANLAN: Don't think that was her home.

730
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:36,252
MARISHA: In her hideout.

731
00:45:36,252 --> 00:45:39,317
TALIESIN: In her room beneath the house.

732
00:45:39,317 --> 00:45:41,583
MATT: "How do you know where she lived?"

733
00:45:41,583 --> 00:45:51,972
TALIESIN: We are very clever. But not clever
enough to stop this. This appears to have happened

734
00:45:51,972 --> 00:45:56,191
possibly before we even-- we don't know when it
happened. It happened a while ago.

735
00:45:56,191 --> 00:45:58,107
LAURA: About a week ago. I think.

736
00:45:58,107 --> 00:46:00,413
MATT: Percy, make a persuasion check.

737
00:46:00,413 --> 00:46:10,789
TALIESIN: 13.

738
00:46:10,789 --> 00:46:19,499
MATT: Okay. Treev puts one hand out on the bar,
he's got a big heavy coin in it, he's nervously

739
00:46:19,499 --> 00:46:22,618
tapping it. (few knocks on wood)

740
00:46:22,618 --> 00:46:26,222
TALIESIN: We think we know who did it. In fact, we
are near positive we know who did it.

741
00:46:26,222 --> 00:46:31,105
MATT: You hear (door closing) as the door of the
tavern closes and all the patrons you saw are now

742
00:46:31,105 --> 00:46:36,924
standing up completely sober and they're all
taking a circle to the outside of your group. He's

743
00:46:36,924 --> 00:46:45,920
leaning forward, going, "All right, so you're
clever. You came looking for the mistress, she

744
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,525
"suddenly winds up dead. You found her body."

745
00:46:48,525 --> 00:46:51,463
TALIESIN: And we tell you this as opposed to
leaving.

746
00:46:51,463 --> 00:46:53,595
LAURA: We had nothing to do with it. We could've
left town.

747
00:46:53,595 --> 00:46:57,192
MARISHA: Clearly we know how this looks, which is
why we came to you first.

748
00:46:57,192 --> 00:46:59,361
TALIESIN: We are desperate in finding who did
this.

749
00:46:59,361 --> 00:47:01,257
LIAM: What's the hooded figure doing right now?

750
00:47:01,257 --> 00:47:07,577
MATT: Still sitting in the back of that shadowed
alcove between a bunch of barrels that are stacked

751
00:47:07,577 --> 00:47:09,170
and part of the bar side.

752
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:10,718
LIAM: I'm going to keep focused there.

753
00:47:10,718 --> 00:47:11,918
TRAVIS: Is he still tapping the coin?

754
00:47:11,918 --> 00:47:13,172
MATT: No, the coin tapping has stopped.

755
00:47:13,172 --> 00:47:17,991
MARISHA: And what are the people around us doing?
Are they, like, drawing their weapons?

756
00:47:17,991 --> 00:47:18,901
MATT: No.

757
00:47:18,901 --> 00:47:20,102
MARISHA: Do they seem armed?

758
00:47:20,102 --> 00:47:22,675
MATT: Do you take a look around?

759
00:47:22,675 --> 00:47:24,144
MARISHA: I want to just glance.

760
00:47:24,144 --> 00:47:27,282
TRAVIS: I take a very blatant look around.

761
00:47:27,282 --> 00:47:35,606
MATT: Okay. None of them appear to be armed, but
they're all looking very closely upon you. You can

762
00:47:35,606 --> 00:47:37,688
make a perception check, Keyleth and Grog, if
you'd like.

763
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:42,167
TRAVIS: 13.

764
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:43,609
MARISHA: Not bad.

765
00:47:43,609 --> 00:47:45,167
TRAVIS: There is a ceiling.

766
00:47:45,167 --> 00:47:48,060
MARISHA: Straight perception? 25.

767
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:51,036
MATT: Okay. Yeah, you see them staring. They look
pretty normal.

768
00:47:51,036 --> 00:47:53,002
TRAVIS: They look pretty.

769
00:47:53,002 --> 00:47:58,803
MATT: You do notice, what you didn't quite notice
before, when you first entered, but a lot of these

770
00:47:58,803 --> 00:48:04,507
tables have like small cubbies on the edges, and
each one of them are standing very close to one.

771
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:10,712
One you see a little bit of a pommel that is
barely poking out and they're all at the

772
00:48:10,712 --> 00:48:17,669
ready. This tavern definitely is-- Mercenary band
uses this tavern as their base of operation and has

773
00:48:17,669 --> 00:48:23,418
definitely seemingly outfitted it to be functionally
good place for mercenaries when they need to be.

774
00:48:23,418 --> 00:48:28,770
MARISHA: I look down in front of me. Is there any
hidden cubbies in the table that we are at?

775
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:30,543
MATT: That you are at?

776
00:48:30,543 --> 00:48:31,606
MARISHA: Yeah.

777
00:48:31,606 --> 00:48:35,341
MATT: You have to get down to really inspect. You
want to do that?

778
00:48:35,341 --> 00:48:36,348
MARISHA: No.

779
00:48:36,348 --> 00:48:40,754
MATT: Okay. At initial glance you don't see
anything, because everything is close to you, it's

780
00:48:40,754 --> 00:48:45,133
from a top-down perspective and you're blocked from
seeing anything beneath.

781
00:48:45,133 --> 00:48:53,013
TALIESIN: For what it's worth, we will not draw
first. We want to find her. Have any of your

782
00:48:53,013 --> 00:49:00,414
people seen a woman with one metal arm? She's so
dangerous and now so much more dangerous.

783
00:49:00,414 --> 00:49:12,399
MATT: He goes ahead and puts his finger up this
way and marks this direction. The figure that

784
00:49:12,399 --> 00:49:19,988
you're watching, Vax, steps out from the shadow and
walks very calmly across the room, through all of

785
00:49:19,988 --> 00:49:26,812
you right to the edge of the bar by the door and
goes-- not breaking eye contact with you, speaks

786
00:49:26,812 --> 00:49:35,575
out of the side of his mouth, Treev goes, "Go
ahead and check their story. See her abode. We're

787
00:49:35,575 --> 00:49:40,016
"all going to wait here nice and patiently together
until we figure out what the fuck is going on."

788
00:49:40,016 --> 00:49:44,397
TRAVIS: Makes sense. Do you have any mead?

789
00:49:44,397 --> 00:49:46,091
MATT: "We got mead."

790
00:49:46,091 --> 00:49:52,659
TALIESIN: In the meantime, I'd like to at least to
start to tell you what we need next, for when our

791
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:54,050
story is confirmed.

792
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:58,799
MATT: "Well, you've certainly got a captive audience,
so go ahead."

793
00:49:58,799 --> 00:50:08,547
TALIESIN: This woman has been tracking us. She
placed a mystical tracker upon us at some point.

794
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:17,733
We've just discovered it and we need to find a way
to move it away and put it somewhere she does not

795
00:50:17,733 --> 00:50:25,437
suspect that we know that she placed it and does
not see us coming when it's time for us to kill her.

796
00:50:25,437 --> 00:50:30,688
MATT: "So you're saying this woman that you're
chasing is the one that killed the mistress?"

797
00:50:30,688 --> 00:50:33,051
TALIESIN: Yes. We believe so.

798
00:50:33,051 --> 00:50:40,804
LAURA: Your mistress has-- had a very powerful item on
her. It's why we sought her out as well.

799
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:44,975
MATT: "More so blinded-sided at the idea that the
mistress was felled by someone. She could take

800
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:47,137
"care of herself and has for quite some time."

801
00:50:47,137 --> 00:50:51,514
LAURA: From what I could see, her attackers were
not alone. There were five of them.

802
00:50:51,514 --> 00:50:53,552
LIAM: They had an unfair advantage.

803
00:50:53,552 --> 00:50:59,928
MATT: "Five of them and a woman, you say?" His
eyes narrow for a second. "Describe this woman."

804
00:50:59,928 --> 00:51:09,021
SAM: She disguises her appearance, so how we know
her might not be how you have seen her. She has

805
00:51:09,021 --> 00:51:12,513
sometimes shown herself as an old woman.

806
00:51:12,513 --> 00:51:20,136
MATT: "Old woman?" And he starts describing. "Sort
of a spindly gray-blonde hair, tumbles past the

807
00:51:20,136 --> 00:51:24,225
"shoulders, piercing blue-ish green eyes."

808
00:51:24,225 --> 00:51:25,928
TALIESIN: <i>Always</i> piercing eyes.

809
00:51:25,928 --> 00:51:28,212
SAM: Did she come through here?

810
00:51:28,212 --> 00:51:32,062
MATT: "She was the last one to hire the mistress.
About a week before you came."

811
00:51:32,062 --> 00:51:33,173
TALIESIN: (sighs heavily)

812
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,419
SAM: What was the job?

813
00:51:34,419 --> 00:51:35,597
MATT: "I don't know."

814
00:51:35,597 --> 00:51:38,723
SAM: And she had some fellows traveling with her?

815
00:51:38,723 --> 00:51:42,759
MATT: "She had five individuals following her,
aye."

816
00:51:42,759 --> 00:51:44,245
MARISHA: What did they look like?

817
00:51:44,245 --> 00:51:48,307
MATT: "Didn't get the best good look. Kept it very
hush-hush between me and the lady at the table.

818
00:51:48,307 --> 00:51:51,628
"Rest of them stayed at the back of the bar. Then
they went on their business."

819
00:51:51,628 --> 00:51:53,215
SAM: Where were they staying?

820
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,180
MATT: "Here."

821
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,467
SAM: In our rooms?

822
00:51:55,467 --> 00:51:56,995
MATT: "Aye."

823
00:51:56,995 --> 00:52:00,607
SAM: That gives me the heebie-jeebies.

824
00:52:00,607 --> 00:52:05,389
TALIESIN: That does not make me feel good. She is
so dangerous.

825
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:07,634
MARISHA: How was she a full week ahead of us?

826
00:52:07,634 --> 00:52:10,223
LAURA: Oh shit. Treev--

827
00:52:10,223 --> 00:52:13,713
SAM: Because we went to Draconia.

828
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:16,759
LAURA: I put Dust of Tracelessness on the ground.
In her home.

829
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:18,851
MATT: "What's that mean?"

830
00:52:18,851 --> 00:52:24,834
TALIESIN: It's going to obfuscate any of the
scuffle. They're only going to find a body with

831
00:52:24,834 --> 00:52:26,206
holes in it.

832
00:52:26,206 --> 00:52:32,619
MATT: "So you're telling me that you came in here
with a story about a murder of one of my finest mercs."

833
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:33,613
TALIESIN: Yes.

834
00:52:33,613 --> 00:52:39,323
MATT: "And you decided upon finding this murder to
get rid of all the evidence of said murder and

835
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,925
"anything that could possibly point to you not
being the murderers."

836
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:48,222
TALIESIN: I did point this out to everybody before
we came down here, but at the moment we were a

837
00:52:48,222 --> 00:52:51,054
little bit thrown by the dead woman.

838
00:52:51,054 --> 00:52:52,882
MATT: "I'm not going to lie, I mean as far as--"

839
00:52:52,882 --> 00:52:57,753
LIAM: Why would we come directly to you if that
were the case? Why wouldn't we have not just left?

840
00:52:57,753 --> 00:52:59,482
LAURA: Plus, you know what?

841
00:52:59,482 --> 00:53:02,450
TALIESIN: They will be able to tell the body is at
least a week old.

842
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:06,771
LAURA: Exactly. Your man has seen a dead body
before. He's going to be able to tell that it's

843
00:53:06,771 --> 00:53:08,101
been there for a while.

844
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:11,432
MARISHA: I'm sure you have a cleric in the circle.
Talk to her firsthand if you have to.

845
00:53:11,432 --> 00:53:15,785
LIAM: I'm curious if you can imagine a reason why
we would come to you with this rather than sneak

846
00:53:15,785 --> 00:53:17,109
away in the night.

847
00:53:17,109 --> 00:53:19,333
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm just curious how much the mead
is?

848
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:31,479
MATT: "On the house." He reaches under the bar and
pulls up one thick, dark, red ceramic bottle.

849
00:53:31,479 --> 00:53:35,559
Cap's already off. He's plucked it off with his
thumb and sets it in front of you.

850
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:37,775
TRAVIS: My thanks.

851
00:53:37,775 --> 00:53:40,432
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry.

852
00:53:40,432 --> 00:53:52,209
MATT: "Guess it's possibly one of the major
setbacks of this line of business. Very few grow

853
00:53:52,209 --> 00:54:04,107
"too old and gray and get to die happy in their beds.
God knows I wasn't planning to." There's a long,

854
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:12,014
awkward pause interspersed with bits of
conversation for about 15 minutes before the

855
00:54:12,014 --> 00:54:18,446
hooded figure returns, enters the door, comes over
and whispers for a good solid minute in the ear of

856
00:54:18,446 --> 00:54:29,804
Treev, before stepping back and calmly walking
back to its corner. Treev sits up. "Well, parts of

857
00:54:29,804 --> 00:54:36,775
"your story certainly hold up. The body has been
there for a while, at least from before I saw you.

858
00:54:36,775 --> 00:54:40,218
"Mind you, I don't know when you came into town. We
only met a few days ago."

859
00:54:40,218 --> 00:54:47,837
TALIESIN: If we were smart enough to take care of
her and smart enough to pull all of this off, this

860
00:54:47,837 --> 00:54:49,908
would be a ridiculous move.

861
00:54:49,908 --> 00:54:53,642
LAURA: (laughs) That we would come to hire her after
we had already--

862
00:54:53,642 --> 00:54:54,709
MARISHA: Killed her?

863
00:54:54,709 --> 00:54:56,345
TALIESIN: I would beg you to explain why we're
having this conversation.

864
00:54:56,345 --> 00:55:01,207
MATT: "Oh, believe me. A lot of <i>you</i> doesn't make
sense, period. So I'm just trying to figure it all

865
00:55:01,207 --> 00:55:06,690
"out." And he rubs the end of his long draconian
snout.

866
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:12,329
TALIESIN: The woman in question helped murder my
entire family, took great pleasure and delight in

867
00:55:12,329 --> 00:55:14,897
it. I have been tracking her for years.

868
00:55:14,897 --> 00:55:17,048
MATT: "What you plan to do when you find her,
then?"

869
00:55:17,048 --> 00:55:24,872
TALIESIN: Kill her. That's all. I've lost my taste
for anything beyond that, but she is dangerous and

870
00:55:24,872 --> 00:55:26,183
she is evil.

871
00:55:26,183 --> 00:55:29,177
LIAM: In this moment, everyone in this room wants
the same thing.

872
00:55:29,177 --> 00:55:37,577
MARISHA: We didn't come to you because we
necessarily needed to go through the proper

873
00:55:37,577 --> 00:55:42,641
channels, we did it because we were trying to be
forthcoming. Clearly you are all a talented bunch,

874
00:55:42,641 --> 00:55:44,615
so are we.

875
00:55:44,615 --> 00:55:49,894
TALIESIN: My feelings for her have become very
complex. I don't care who kills her at this point.

876
00:55:49,894 --> 00:55:52,055
She just needs to be removed from the earth.

877
00:55:52,055 --> 00:55:55,236
MATT: "Which one of you is your dealmaker?"

878
00:55:55,236 --> 00:55:59,794
LIAM: I boot Scanlan forward on the tush.

879
00:55:59,794 --> 00:56:01,740
SAM: Hello, hi.

880
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:02,974
MATT: "This one?"

881
00:56:02,974 --> 00:56:06,459
SAM: I make the best deals, I know the best
words.

882
00:56:06,459 --> 00:56:11,770
MATT: "<i>This</i> one?"

883
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:17,528
SAM: Sometimes it's Vex, but many times it's me.

884
00:56:17,528 --> 00:56:27,237
MATT: He leans over the bar and gets real close up
to you, and takes a moment to (sniffs). "Aye, you

885
00:56:27,237 --> 00:56:31,872
"smell like trouble. I like that." Make a
persuasion check.

886
00:56:31,872 --> 00:56:33,556
SAM: What am I persuading him to do?

887
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:36,298
MATT: This is your essence of presence and telling
him that you're the kind of person that--

888
00:56:36,298 --> 00:56:37,619
SAM: Oh, my general charm?

889
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:38,564
MATT: Your general charm.

890
00:56:38,564 --> 00:56:41,982
TALIESIN: I don't know what he's wearing, but it's
very nice.

891
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:44,819
SAM: Persuasion, you say? 29.

892
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:55,104
MATT: "How is this for a deal? I got a nice fine
look at your faces, I got friends all across these

893
00:56:55,104 --> 00:57:06,680
"lands. If what you say is true, you go. We let you
leave. You find this murdering bitch, you kill

894
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:15,429
"her. I want one thing, her good hand. I think that
would be vengeance enough for the mistress."

895
00:57:15,429 --> 00:57:18,024
MARISHA: I mean, we don't have any use for it.

896
00:57:18,024 --> 00:57:20,012
TALIESIN: I feel <i>very</i> good about that deal.

897
00:57:20,012 --> 00:57:21,341
LIAM: Good terms.

898
00:57:21,341 --> 00:57:24,378
MATT: "Not talking to you. I'm talking to <i>you</i>."

899
00:57:24,378 --> 00:57:28,219
SAM: That's lovely, but we can't find her without
some assistance.

900
00:57:28,219 --> 00:57:33,472
MATT: "Well, you've come to the right place. What
assistance do I have to give you, what do you need?"

901
00:57:33,472 --> 00:57:37,923
SAM: We need to get this curse off of the thing
that found your assassin.

902
00:57:37,923 --> 00:57:41,607
MATT: "Can't really help you with that, sorry,
mate."

903
00:57:41,607 --> 00:57:44,404
SAM: Don't have any magic wielders among you?

904
00:57:44,404 --> 00:57:48,617
MATT: "We've got scattered mercs throughout the
city, aye, but they work for coin, and half of

905
00:57:48,617 --> 00:57:49,952
"them are busy in other jobs."

906
00:57:49,952 --> 00:57:51,178
LIAM: We have coin.

907
00:57:51,178 --> 00:57:54,275
MATT: "How much you got?"

908
00:57:54,275 --> 00:57:56,067
LIAM: What do we got?

909
00:57:56,067 --> 00:57:57,667
TRAVIS: Enough.

910
00:57:57,667 --> 00:58:04,349
TALIESIN: Let us know what it takes. Money is
money and we have a long way to go and a lot to

911
00:58:04,349 --> 00:58:07,146
deal with, but we are happy to pay for the work
that is done.

912
00:58:07,146 --> 00:58:09,532
MATT: "All right. I can call someone in."

913
00:58:09,532 --> 00:58:14,629
SAM: We also may need some naval assistance--

914
00:58:14,629 --> 00:58:17,249
LAURA: Specifically an airship of sorts--

915
00:58:17,249 --> 00:58:22,273
TALIESIN: Or transportation, she's heading, she's
on a boat, she's heading north to the island of--

916
00:58:22,304 --> 00:58:23,911
TRAVIS: Glintshore.

917
00:58:23,911 --> 00:58:28,611
MARISHA: Or, you know, even if you know of any
trees, big trees.

918
00:58:28,611 --> 00:58:37,219
MATT: He goes "Hmm. Ships, no, not much in the way
of ships here in the middle of a desert, you're

919
00:58:37,219 --> 00:58:41,686
"looking for them sky-buggers. Looking for a ship
like that for seafaring types you're going to want

920
00:58:41,686 --> 00:58:47,322
"to go past the Agrin Mountains, then make your way
towards the Bay of Gifts."

921
00:58:47,322 --> 00:58:48,954
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Bay of Gifts.

922
00:58:48,954 --> 00:58:50,920
MATT: "That's where you'll find the port town of
Shamal."

923
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,886
MARISHA: Port town of Shamal?

924
00:58:52,886 --> 00:59:00,502
MATT: "Shamal. The mountain range is vast in
itself, you're looking at, oh, at least a week on

925
00:59:00,502 --> 00:59:02,555
"foot to try and traverse those mountains."

926
00:59:02,555 --> 00:59:03,928
LIAM: Did you say Bay of Gifs?

927
00:59:03,928 --> 00:59:05,358
SAM: Bay of Jifs, it's pronounced.

928
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:08,129
MATT: "I'm going to fucking fuck you."

929
00:59:08,129 --> 00:59:11,838
(laughter)

930
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:15,438
TALIESIN: It's a local joke, I'm so sorry.

931
00:59:15,438 --> 00:59:20,643
MARISHA: The port of Shamal?

932
00:59:20,643 --> 00:59:23,637
SAM: There is a skyport near here, is that true?

933
00:59:23,637 --> 00:59:26,113
MATT: "Aye, it's over by the--"

934
00:59:26,113 --> 00:59:28,891
SAM: Controlled by the local government?

935
00:59:28,891 --> 00:59:32,732
MATT: "There's no one fucking controls the
skyport."

936
00:59:32,732 --> 00:59:35,514
TALIESIN: We're not asking you, we have other
friends as well.

937
00:59:35,514 --> 00:59:41,043
MATT: "Well, if you're looking for speed, it's
probably your best bet. Ships on this ocean, let's

938
00:59:41,043 --> 00:59:44,296
"say the weather's not usually handy."

939
00:59:44,296 --> 00:59:47,758
TALIESIN: We are looking for speed, and a crazy
captain.

940
00:59:47,758 --> 00:59:51,552
MATT: "Well, wish you the best of luck."

941
00:59:51,552 --> 00:59:52,716
LAURA: Thank you.

942
00:59:52,716 --> 01:00:00,233
MATT: "Now, go! Kill her. Give me her hand. I
figure if time goes by and I haven't heard from

943
01:00:00,233 --> 01:00:04,017
"you, you've either died or I'll be sending some of
our mercs to come find you."

944
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:07,001
LIAM: Yeah, but the magic thing with the gun.

945
01:00:07,001 --> 01:00:11,148
SAM: How long would it take to get this person who
can remove a curse?

946
01:00:11,148 --> 01:00:13,981
TALIESIN: Or if you were going to go do something
like this, who would you find in town?

947
01:00:13,981 --> 01:00:18,292
MATT: "If you're looking for fast, speedy, and
immediate assistance with this, well, that's going

948
01:00:18,292 --> 01:00:23,903
"to have to run the cost up a bit, see. We have
quite an enchanter that could probably help you

949
01:00:23,903 --> 01:00:24,803
"with that."

950
01:00:24,803 --> 01:00:25,757
LAURA: Oh really?

951
01:00:25,757 --> 01:00:34,776
MATT: "Aye. See if in the next hour I could bring
him in, but it'll run you, full disillusion or

952
01:00:34,776 --> 01:00:38,726
"whatever you need, 750 gold."

953
01:00:38,726 --> 01:00:41,553
TALIESIN: Not full disillusion, how about a
transference?

954
01:00:41,553 --> 01:00:43,464
MATT: "Transference--"

955
01:00:43,464 --> 01:00:45,320
TALIESIN: To move the enchantment to another
object.

956
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,771
MATT: "Well, takes--"

957
01:00:46,771 --> 01:00:50,037
LAURA: It's a much easier enchantment.

958
01:00:50,037 --> 01:00:55,038
MATT: "Moving something takes a little bit longer
than to just get rid of something."

959
01:00:55,038 --> 01:00:56,317
TALIESIN: How much longer?

960
01:00:56,317 --> 01:01:01,318
MATT: "I dunno, not one of them types. But I mean,
we've had a couple of enchantments moved in the

961
01:01:01,318 --> 01:01:04,655
"past, and that was anywhere from a few days to a
few weeks, get that done."

962
01:01:04,655 --> 01:01:07,229
MARISHA: Why don't we call them in and have them
look at it?

963
01:01:07,229 --> 01:01:08,501
MATT: "All right."

964
01:01:08,501 --> 01:01:09,607
SAM: 750? Do we have that to spare?

965
01:01:09,607 --> 01:01:10,454
TRAVIS: Yes.

966
01:01:10,454 --> 01:01:11,879
TALIESIN: That's worth its weight.

967
01:01:11,879 --> 01:01:14,353
MATT: "750."

968
01:01:14,353 --> 01:01:18,457
LAURA: 750, or if you have a need of gems, we have
gems.

969
01:01:18,457 --> 01:01:22,875
LIAM: You don't get fast and cheap.

970
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:23,955
TALIESIN: I know.

971
01:01:23,955 --> 01:01:25,252
SAM: Are you a gem lover?

972
01:01:25,252 --> 01:01:30,253
MATT: "I carry a bit of jewelry on occasion."

973
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:32,555
SAM: I like you. What do we have?

974
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:36,508
LAURA: So many things. You should call your
enchanter.

975
01:01:36,508 --> 01:01:44,973
MATT: "All right," and he goes ahead and pulls out
a small tome of blank sheets, many you see have

976
01:01:44,973 --> 01:01:49,773
been torn out, and he makes a quick note on one,
rolls it up very simply, doesn't do the usual

977
01:01:49,845 --> 01:01:58,523
rigmarole of an official writ, but hands it to the
masked hooded figure in the corner who walks out

978
01:01:58,523 --> 01:02:02,980
and darts off. "Kyme'll be here in a hour."

979
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,015
LAURA: An hour.

980
01:02:04,015 --> 01:02:04,893
SAM: Kine?

981
01:02:04,893 --> 01:02:05,782
MATT: "Kyme."

982
01:02:05,782 --> 01:02:07,129
LAURA: Kynan?

983
01:02:07,129 --> 01:02:10,549
LIAM: Sorry, that rang a bell. Sorry.

984
01:02:10,549 --> 01:02:13,871
MATT: "Payment?"

985
01:02:13,871 --> 01:02:17,325
LAURA: Payment?

986
01:02:17,325 --> 01:02:18,743
SAM: Up front? Wow.

987
01:02:18,743 --> 01:02:21,114
LAURA: But we don't even know what he's doing
yet.

988
01:02:21,114 --> 01:02:23,604
MATT: "Do you trust in my service?"

989
01:02:23,604 --> 01:02:28,842
LAURA: Of course, I don't know what we're going to
have him do, that's all.

990
01:02:28,842 --> 01:02:32,248
MATT: "Well if you'd much rather, we could go
ahead and clean out your guts here in the floor,

991
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:35,177
"wouldn't be the first time I had to swab the
floors here."

992
01:02:35,177 --> 01:02:44,046
LAURA: How about these two beautiful sapphires?
They're quite lovely.

993
01:02:44,046 --> 01:02:45,878
MATT: "All right."

994
01:02:45,878 --> 01:02:50,863
LAURA: And-- and I pull out a giant raw ruby as
well.

995
01:02:50,863 --> 01:02:58,837
MATT: He knocks the countertop and gestures for
you to put them down. He looks over at one of the

996
01:02:58,901 --> 01:03:04,649
guys in the bar. They've all relaxed a bit now,
two of them have sat down. One of them approaches;

997
01:03:04,649 --> 01:03:14,649
human, a little scruffy, looks like he's a little
ill to be honest, like he's probably not had a

998
01:03:14,649 --> 01:03:21,121
good week of food. He, however, walks up and
fumbles through a small pouch and pulls out a

999
01:03:21,121 --> 01:03:30,436
small jeweler's eyepiece and takes them up and
inspects each of them independently. How much are

1000
01:03:30,436 --> 01:03:31,894
they worth?

1001
01:03:31,894 --> 01:03:36,572
LAURA: 200 each for the sapphires, and the ruby is
150.

1002
01:03:36,572 --> 01:03:38,169
SAM: Jesus, Laura.

1003
01:03:38,169 --> 01:03:40,553
LAURA: It's only a hundred gold short!

1004
01:03:40,553 --> 01:03:53,318
MATT: "I'd take it." Sits back down. "Very well,
debt is paid." Takes the gems, pops them in his

1005
01:03:53,318 --> 01:03:57,635
little side pouch. Do you guys wait for the hour?

1006
01:03:57,635 --> 01:04:03,887
TALIESIN: I was going to say, if somebody wants to
go booking passage on an airship, my personal

1007
01:04:03,887 --> 01:04:07,559
feeling is that Grog and Scanlan would be the
people to send on such an adventure.

1008
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:13,528
SAM: Grog? I mean, yes, Grog would be good at
that, yes, let's do that.

1009
01:04:13,528 --> 01:04:16,514
TALIESIN: I'm only saying Grog because then they
know what they're getting into.

1010
01:04:16,514 --> 01:04:18,073
SAM: I like that idea.

1011
01:04:18,073 --> 01:04:19,992
TRAVIS: Are you trying to get me out of the room?

1012
01:04:19,992 --> 01:04:26,048
TALIESIN: No! Well, yes. Would you rather sit for
an hour in here or would you rather go outside and

1013
01:04:26,048 --> 01:04:28,080
talk to somebody about a giant flying boat?

1014
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,939
TRAVIS: The last one.

1015
01:04:29,939 --> 01:04:34,905
LIAM: Perfect, it's like Hannibal and Mr. T,
together, that's what you want.

1016
01:04:34,905 --> 01:04:38,168
TALIESIN: I don't know, that's my opinion,
personally, unless anybody else--

1017
01:04:38,168 --> 01:04:40,045
TRAVIS: Just call me Baracus, let's go.

1018
01:04:40,045 --> 01:04:42,543
SAM: All right, we'll go.

1019
01:04:42,543 --> 01:04:45,445
TALIESIN: Our friends are going to arrange travel
for us, the rest of us are going to stay here, is

1020
01:04:45,445 --> 01:04:46,830
that appropriate?

1021
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:55,137
MATT: "Certainly. Sit, I'll get you some food." So
is it going to be just you two?

1022
01:04:55,137 --> 01:04:57,691
SAM: I guess we're going to go try to find an
airship.

1023
01:04:57,789 --> 01:05:02,067
TRAVIS: Yeah, Twins! Schwarzenegger and DeVito, at
it again!

1024
01:05:02,067 --> 01:05:04,391
(laughter)

1025
01:05:04,391 --> 01:05:05,642
TALIESIN: Julius, my god!

1026
01:05:05,642 --> 01:05:07,310
SAM: Which one's which?

1027
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:10,644
LIAM: Vincent, you are my twin.

1028
01:05:10,644 --> 01:05:17,165
TALIESIN: I'm pregnant, Vincent. Oh, wrong one,
sorry. I always thought it was the same guy. In my

1029
01:05:17,165 --> 01:05:18,648
head. It's a sequel.

1030
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:25,591
MATT: All right, so, as the rest of you guys stay
behind you get a fair meal, the two of you begin

1031
01:05:25,591 --> 01:05:36,740
making your way through Ank'Harel. You're making
your way over towards the edge of the Suncut

1032
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:42,662
Bazaar towards the Sand Herald district right on
that cusp there is where you saw the skyport in

1033
01:05:42,662 --> 01:05:47,335
the distance. Go ahead and make an investigation
check. You can make one as well, Grog.

1034
01:05:47,335 --> 01:05:49,316
SAM: 25.

1035
01:05:49,316 --> 01:05:53,078
TRAVIS: 17!

1036
01:05:53,078 --> 01:05:57,307
MATT: All right. Where normally it would be
confusing to find where the base of it is as it is

1037
01:05:57,307 --> 01:06:03,083
obfuscated by a series of other larger buildings,
you guys ask a couple of folks rather quickly that

1038
01:06:03,083 --> 01:06:08,780
know the layout of the town really well, and with
enough of a flash of a smile and a flash of a

1039
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:18,437
really intense arm muscle, within the next 30
minutes or so find yourself at the base of the

1040
01:06:18,437 --> 01:06:20,676
actual skyport. It is called the Indala Skyport.

1041
01:06:20,676 --> 01:06:22,608
SAM: (sings) Indala.

1042
01:06:22,608 --> 01:06:31,486
MATT: Not as tall as the one in Emon which lays on
the outskirts of the Cloudtop District, but it

1043
01:06:31,486 --> 01:06:39,677
appears to be on the level, it's maybe a good
five stories up. The outside of it is a similar

1044
01:06:39,677 --> 01:06:44,260
chain lifted platform as the tower at the Cerulean
Palace that you guys traversed earlier in your

1045
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:50,366
time in Ank'Harel. There is a large stone scaffold
with no walls, sitting there on the ground. As you

1046
01:06:50,366 --> 01:06:56,007
approach, there are two people dressed in simple
clothing, you see some dust and dirt on their

1047
01:06:56,007 --> 01:07:00,427
hands, they're in the midst of moving crates up
and down and you see they're moving some barrels

1048
01:07:00,427 --> 01:07:06,313
off of the platform, putting them up onto a cart
that's probably going to be wheeled deeper into

1049
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:16,201
the city. As you approach the platform you see one
of them is by a bell mechanism, attached to part

1050
01:07:16,201 --> 01:07:21,721
of the platform, a small block that's about
shoulder high, and there's a bell on the end of it

1051
01:07:21,721 --> 01:07:23,071
with a ringer.

1052
01:07:23,071 --> 01:07:29,274
TRAVIS: Wait, before we ring Indala: have you ever
rented a skyship before?

1053
01:07:29,274 --> 01:07:31,002
SAM: No, I have no idea what we're doing here.

1054
01:07:31,002 --> 01:07:32,201
TRAVIS: Oh really?

1055
01:07:32,201 --> 01:07:38,811
SAM: I mean, I assume we're trying to find out how
much it costs for a seven day rental including a

1056
01:07:38,811 --> 01:07:40,103
pilot or two?

1057
01:07:40,103 --> 01:07:41,923
TRAVIS: So we're doing this like the straight and
narrow way.

1058
01:07:41,923 --> 01:07:44,110
SAM: We're getting the information, probably come
back and steal it.

1059
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:47,624
TRAVIS: Ooh, okay, I'll be quiet, you talk.

1060
01:07:47,624 --> 01:07:50,642
SAM: Okay, well, you're pretty good at this too.

1061
01:07:50,642 --> 01:07:55,083
TRAVIS: Yeah, well. (singing) Indala, Indala

1062
01:07:55,083 --> 01:07:57,005
LIAM: Help, help, it's happening.

1063
01:07:57,005 --> 01:07:58,582
TALIESIN: Help, help, it's actually happening.

1064
01:07:58,582 --> 01:08:00,117
TRAVIS: Do you mind if I ring the bell?

1065
01:08:00,117 --> 01:08:02,927
SAM: Yeah, go for it.

1066
01:08:02,927 --> 01:08:06,306
TRAVIS: Can I ring the fucking shit out of that
bell?

1067
01:08:06,306 --> 01:08:10,298
MATT: As you step up onto the stone platform both
of you, the two guys that are working, the guy

1068
01:08:10,298 --> 01:08:14,451
keeps putting the barrels, there's like two or
three on the side there, and he goes ahead and

1069
01:08:14,451 --> 01:08:21,809
sets one of the three up, staring at you as you
approach. The other guy is to the side, goes, "Can

1070
01:08:21,809 --> 01:08:27,430
"I help you?" As you walk past and turn back and
smile and (bell ringing) start ringing the crap

1071
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:32,245
out of it. Make a strength check.

1072
01:08:32,245 --> 01:08:38,288
TRAVIS: Aww no, oh that's not too bad. 13.

1073
01:08:38,288 --> 01:08:45,791
MATT: 13, okay. You have enough control over your
physical brawn as to not snap or destroy the bell,

1074
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:51,125
however, what happens is after you ring the bell
for a few seconds, the guy goes, "Wait, no!" And

1075
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:58,585
before anything else happens, the chains that were
slack tighten up, and the platform begins to lift

1076
01:08:58,585 --> 01:09:04,305
up. The guy who had two barrels left on the
platform still is like "No, wait!" And goes over

1077
01:09:04,305 --> 01:09:07,927
and tries to grab one of the barrels as it tumbles
off and breaks on the ground next to him.

1078
01:09:07,927 --> 01:09:12,622
(yelling in Marquesian) and is raising his fists.

1079
01:09:12,622 --> 01:09:15,236
SAM: We're on an elevator?

1080
01:09:15,236 --> 01:09:20,510
MATT: Yeah, and it's now lifting up and it's about
15-20 feet off the ground and it's going up to the

1081
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:25,990
top. The bell seemed to have notified whatever
crew is bringing the platform up, but he didn't

1082
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:29,116
get a chance to finish bringing his load off the
platform before you rung the bell.

1083
01:09:29,116 --> 01:09:30,314
TRAVIS: I think we're doing it right.

1084
01:09:30,314 --> 01:09:31,391
SAM: I think so.

1085
01:09:31,391 --> 01:09:37,482
MATT: As you leave the two gentlemen below, as the
two of you lift up on this platform, you make your

1086
01:09:37,482 --> 01:09:45,615
way up to the elevated terrace that marks the
actual skyport and it's a large, wide, thick

1087
01:09:45,615 --> 01:09:50,679
platform that's built atop a series of warehouses
that fill out this district, and this was a newer

1088
01:09:50,679 --> 01:09:58,189
addition to it as this technology became
available. Go ahead and roll a history check.

1089
01:09:58,189 --> 01:10:00,589
SAM: Natural 20.

1090
01:10:00,589 --> 01:10:05,397
TRAVIS: Wow!

1091
01:10:05,397 --> 01:10:06,812
SAM: Love me some airships.

1092
01:10:06,812 --> 01:10:12,708
MATT: Actually, skyships originated in Ank'Harel.
This is where the crystals that hold them aloft

1093
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:19,769
are enchanted. There have been other ships. There
are different designs that are constructed in

1094
01:10:19,769 --> 01:10:26,511
different towns. You do know that there is no
skyship transport to Wildemount, and that was part

1095
01:10:26,511 --> 01:10:35,438
of the reason why the Sovereign Uriel was trying
to make that deal with the Briarwoods under the

1096
01:10:35,438 --> 01:10:42,716
idea that it would open trade with Wildemount.
It's pretty insular, locked off from the larger

1097
01:10:42,716 --> 01:10:46,779
countries here that work together. The skyport
here is probably the first skyport that was built

1098
01:10:46,779 --> 01:10:54,092
and this is the origin of that tech. As you come
to the very top of the platform,

1099
01:10:54,092 --> 01:11:01,372
it eventually stops and you see one
gentleman there who's essentially working this

1100
01:11:01,372 --> 01:11:05,010
large crank that brings the platform up and it has
a series of thick chains that wind on themselves.

1101
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:10,017
As soon as he finishes and you guys get to the top
he turns. "What, yes, what. Hello?"

1102
01:11:10,017 --> 01:11:11,343
TRAVIS: Meep-meep!

1103
01:11:11,343 --> 01:11:21,229
SAM: Be pleased. We are here to inquire about some
business if you don't mind.

1104
01:11:21,229 --> 01:11:25,540
MATT: He points that way, and you guys look right,
and the rest of this terrace for the record--

1105
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:35,273
there are two skyships that are currently docked
here at the moment. One that has a very nice,

1106
01:11:35,273 --> 01:11:43,299
thick, heavy design, it has beautiful gems
encrusted in the side and there's brass and gold

1107
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:48,641
inlay that twists into this turquoise transition
to the bottom. It's a beautiful ship. You can see

1108
01:11:48,641 --> 01:11:54,914
there's a crew of about 12, that are currently
loading things onto it right now. There's a big,

1109
01:11:54,914 --> 01:11:57,762
crane-like apparatus similar to what you had in
Emon that is currently putting things onto the

1110
01:11:57,762 --> 01:12:01,817
ship. It looks like it's being heavily loaded for
transport somewhere. There's another ship, it

1111
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:07,717
looks familiar, it's actually very similar to the
Emon designs that you guys saw at the skyports

1112
01:12:07,717 --> 01:12:14,878
over there that appears to be, by about six heavy 
chains, locked to the opposite side of this skyport and doesn't

1113
01:12:14,926 --> 01:12:20,378
seem to have any apparent hustle bustle of crew
around. It's a little bit smaller than the more

1114
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:26,329
intricate design. The one that has all the work
around it does match some of the design aesthetic

1115
01:12:26,329 --> 01:12:30,680
of some of the higher end areas of Ank'Harel, so
that you probably imagine it was one of the

1116
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:35,771
original skyships that was built here. The other
one you saw has the small fins on the side,

1117
01:12:35,771 --> 01:12:40,705
similar to the one you rode across to Vasselheim.
You do also notice that there are about six Hands

1118
01:12:40,705 --> 01:12:45,985
of Ord scattered across the terrace in full armor
that are basically keeping an eye out and watching

1119
01:12:45,985 --> 01:12:56,796
everything, making sure that no bullshit goes
down. You do see a small building that's in the

1120
01:12:56,796 --> 01:13:04,027
center of this terrace, that maybe has about three
or four different rooms. Apparently, the

1121
01:13:04,027 --> 01:13:11,465
individual who was overseeing this entire process
with the one big ship is walking back and forth

1122
01:13:11,465 --> 01:13:14,431
between with instructions to the foreman who's
yelling out to the crewmen who are loading up this

1123
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:16,529
big ship. That'll probably be the place to go to
inquire.

1124
01:13:16,529 --> 01:13:17,973
SAM: Okay. We go over there.

1125
01:13:17,973 --> 01:13:22,135
MATT: All right. As you walk in--

1126
01:13:22,135 --> 01:13:23,506
SAM: We die.

1127
01:13:23,506 --> 01:13:28,382
MATT: Suffer a horrible stroke and fall to the
ground. Scanlan is no more.

1128
01:13:28,382 --> 01:13:30,782
TRAVIS: Green dragon unveils herself and we die.

1129
01:13:30,782 --> 01:13:33,550
LIAM: My barrels! (dragon roaring noise)

1130
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:39,405
TRAVIS: Shit, literally in the last place we would have
looked.

1131
01:13:39,405 --> 01:13:58,072
MATT: So as you walk into the room, it's fairly
quiet. There appears to be a clerk office there

1132
01:13:58,072 --> 01:14:04,723
with a bunch of ledgers stacked up, and you can
see a layout of a number of days with notes

1133
01:14:04,723 --> 01:14:11,980
scrawled in a language that you don't recognize.
There are a couple of small clockwork timepieces

1134
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:16,494
that are against the walls there. And you see a
younger woman, probably mid-20s, but going gray a

1135
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:21,965
little early all on one side of her head, who is
currently going through one of these books. She

1136
01:14:21,965 --> 01:14:29,597
has a quill between her teeth right now, she's
thumbing through the pages. Looks up, "Can I help

1137
01:14:29,597 --> 01:14:32,226
"you?" Takes the quill out, sets it down.

1138
01:14:32,226 --> 01:14:39,579
SAM: Hello, Be pleased, beep beep. My associate
and I would like to inquire about renting an

1139
01:14:39,637 --> 01:14:41,041
airship.

1140
01:14:41,041 --> 01:14:43,250
MATT: "Renting an airship."

1141
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:46,028
SAM: Chartering it for a trip.

1142
01:14:46,028 --> 01:14:56,408
MATT: "Okay, well for now, let's see. Ship Vusin
is already chartered and is loading up to be

1143
01:14:56,408 --> 01:15:04,791
"heading northward towards Issylra. That is not
available. The other one which is the Deera has

1144
01:15:04,791 --> 01:15:10,903
"been docked for about four weeks without use. So
you could go inquire with the captain there."

1145
01:15:10,903 --> 01:15:15,548
SAM: Is that the crappier one or the better one?

1146
01:15:15,548 --> 01:15:16,839
MATT It's the smaller one.

1147
01:15:16,839 --> 01:15:22,145
SAM: Okay, so we would charter from the captain
themself, not from you?

1148
01:15:22,145 --> 01:15:33,566
MATT: "Well the captain would pay us a cut based
on what the destination is."

1149
01:15:33,566 --> 01:15:36,801
SAM: So I can do my homework, how much do you
think a week's charter would run on an airship?

1150
01:15:36,801 --> 01:15:38,551
MATT: "That is for you to negotiate with the
captain."

1151
01:15:38,551 --> 01:15:41,215
TRAVIS: Yes, is there any way to book passage on
the ship that's already moving northward?

1152
01:15:41,215 --> 01:15:43,355
SAM: As passengers.

1153
01:15:43,355 --> 01:15:48,563
MATT: "That is not a passenger-based ship,
unfortunately that is actually working for one of

1154
01:15:48,563 --> 01:15:52,606
"the guilds. It is paid for use of their mercantile
only."

1155
01:15:52,606 --> 01:15:55,376
SAM: Okay.

1156
01:15:55,376 --> 01:15:58,746
TRAVIS: How fast is that smaller ship?

1157
01:15:58,746 --> 01:16:05,949
MATT: "Unloaded, pretty quick. The cargo can load
down ships."

1158
01:16:05,949 --> 01:16:07,405
TRAVIS: Hmm, yes.

1159
01:16:07,405 --> 01:16:10,673
MATT: "Depends on how fast you wish to go and
where you are going. May I ask where you are

1160
01:16:10,673 --> 01:16:11,915
"planning to charter this to?"

1161
01:16:11,915 --> 01:16:15,891
SAM: Our mission is a bit of a hush-hush one, we
better not disclose that.

1162
01:16:15,891 --> 01:16:26,079
TRAVIS: Yeah, we are going to an ocean.

1163
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:29,974
MATT: "Perhaps it is best that we negotiate the
price here than as opposed to with the captain."

1164
01:16:29,974 --> 01:16:34,095
SAM: Yes, that would be preferable for sure.

1165
01:16:34,095 --> 01:16:37,572
TRAVIS: Wait, why? Who's the captain?

1166
01:16:37,572 --> 01:16:45,401
MATT: She stands up and walks over to one of the
small windows that leads out to the terrace and

1167
01:16:45,401 --> 01:16:51,763
you can see another bell that's out there and she
grabs the edge (bell ringing) on the bell, goes

1168
01:16:51,763 --> 01:16:59,965
back to her seat. "I'm calling the captain, he'll
be here." A few minutes pass, in the distance out

1169
01:16:59,965 --> 01:17:11,269
the window you can see a small rope ladder drops,
and a figure makes their way over and walks in.

1170
01:17:11,269 --> 01:17:18,960
Inside, in gold-trimmed armor is a familiar sight,
this is Captain Damon, the guy who actually

1171
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,950
brought you guys across the Ozmit Sea.

1172
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:24,566
SAM: It's our guy! Damon!

1173
01:17:24,566 --> 01:17:28,877
MARISHA: Are there not that many pilots in the
world?

1174
01:17:28,877 --> 01:17:41,036
MATT: There aren't a <i>lot</i> of skyships. You would
know, there's probably six in commission.

1175
01:17:41,036 --> 01:17:43,676
SAM: How fast did this one make the Kessel Run?

1176
01:17:43,676 --> 01:17:49,882
MATT: It was a week across the entire Ozmit Sea,
that was with some cargo on board, so it wasn't

1177
01:17:49,882 --> 01:17:55,609
very slow. It would have taken a normal ship two
and a half weeks.

1178
01:17:55,609 --> 01:17:57,202
SAM: Does Damon recognize us?

1179
01:17:57,202 --> 01:18:00,499
MATT: As he walks in he goes "Yes, are we ready
to--"

1180
01:18:00,499 --> 01:18:03,753
MARISHA: Wyverns attacked us!

1181
01:18:03,753 --> 01:18:04,969
LIAM: (whispering) We're not there.

1182
01:18:04,969 --> 01:18:07,016
MARISHA: I'm not there at all!

1183
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:12,362
TRAVIS: What did you end up drinking in that damn
tavern?

1184
01:18:12,362 --> 01:18:16,446
SAM: Captain Damon! Hello.

1185
01:18:16,446 --> 01:18:17,648
MATT: "Wait, I know you."

1186
01:18:17,648 --> 01:18:20,891
SAM: Yes, we've flown together before. On the
friendly skies.

1187
01:18:20,891 --> 01:18:24,890
MATT: "Yes, that was a dangerous journey."

1188
01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:32,143
SAM: It was, and would have been more dangerous
had we not been there. To protect you and your ship.

1189
01:18:32,143 --> 01:18:37,294
MATT: "Indeed. We appreciate that. What can I do
for you?" And he looks over towards the clerk who

1190
01:18:37,294 --> 01:18:41,121
goes, "They are looking to charter a ship
northward. I know nothing else more, but I figured

1191
01:18:41,121 --> 01:18:45,877
"the confusion here would allow us at least both to
discuss this so we can negotiate the proper

1192
01:18:45,877 --> 01:18:50,726
"price. So you talk, I'll be here to keep record."
And she opens a fresh page in her tome, dips her quill--

1193
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:52,632
TRAVIS: Mmm. Ledgers.

1194
01:18:52,632 --> 01:18:55,127
SAM: Oh, maybe we don't want any of this on the
record for right now.

1195
01:18:55,127 --> 01:18:58,864
MATT: "Okay. Remember that for the negotiation."

1196
01:18:58,864 --> 01:19:00,989
SAM: Oh shit.

1197
01:19:00,989 --> 01:19:08,985
MATT: Captain winks at her. "All right, so, we're
very busy, our books are full and we have a few

1198
01:19:08,985 --> 01:19:15,360
"other individuals that are currently seeking use
of our ship. So what is it you need, where are you

1199
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:16,689
"going and for how long?"

1200
01:19:16,689 --> 01:19:21,281
SAM: This would be a week or less for the
mission.

1201
01:19:21,281 --> 01:19:24,063
TRAVIS: Looking to leave quite soon.

1202
01:19:24,063 --> 01:19:25,393
SAM: Maybe even tomorrow morning.

1203
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:26,571
MATT: "All right."

1204
01:19:26,571 --> 01:19:28,924
SAM: We'd be going north. Correct?

1205
01:19:28,924 --> 01:19:29,892
TRAVIS: Yes.

1206
01:19:29,892 --> 01:19:35,805
SAM: Into the Ozmit Sea, and to a location that we
would disclose to you once we get airborne.

1207
01:19:35,805 --> 01:19:41,405
MATT: You hear a voice in the back, "Also consider
that in the negotiation."

1208
01:19:41,405 --> 01:19:49,200
SAM: But also consider this. We are on a mission
that's very important to the security of both

1209
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:54,946
Marquet and other continents, and we have friends
in high places. And I will flash our little badge.

1210
01:19:54,946 --> 01:19:56,247
TRAVIS: Yes!

1211
01:19:56,247 --> 01:19:59,482
SAM: The badge that J'Mon Sa Ord gave us.

1212
01:19:59,482 --> 01:20:02,071
LIAM: Not your fake little star from pre-show?

1213
01:20:02,071 --> 01:20:05,231
MATT: He looks down and he goes, "That looks very
pretty."

1214
01:20:05,231 --> 01:20:09,133
TRAVIS: Oh, this is given from J'mon Sa Ord.

1215
01:20:09,133 --> 01:20:13,673
MATT: "I don't know who that is."

1216
01:20:13,673 --> 01:20:16,262
SAM: Yes, I didn't think you would--

1217
01:20:16,262 --> 01:20:20,056
MATT: The clerk, however, says, "Wait, you're
saying you got something from J'mon Sa Ord. You

1218
01:20:20,056 --> 01:20:22,607
"saw J'mon Sa Ord, and you were given something."

1219
01:20:22,607 --> 01:20:23,895
TRAVIS and SAM: Yes.

1220
01:20:23,895 --> 01:20:26,541
MATT: (laughter) "Let me see this."

1221
01:20:26,541 --> 01:20:27,905
SAM: I hand it over.

1222
01:20:27,905 --> 01:20:31,023
MATT: She looks at it. (laughter fades)

1223
01:20:31,023 --> 01:20:37,307
(laughter)

1224
01:20:37,307 --> 01:20:41,011
MATT: "Very well."

1225
01:20:41,055 --> 01:20:45,677
TRAVIS: Consider that in negotiation.

1226
01:20:45,677 --> 01:20:56,789
MATT: She looks over and meets eyes with the
captain and goes, "We're going to go ahead, you

1227
01:20:56,789 --> 01:21:00,564
"let me know the price and the palace is going to
pay for this expedition."

1228
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:03,886
SAM: I didn't know it would do that!

1229
01:21:03,886 --> 01:21:10,088
LAURA: That is the most valuable necklace!

1230
01:21:10,088 --> 01:21:17,681
MATT: Opens the book and begins writing down a
series of charges and is racking up--

1231
01:21:17,681 --> 01:21:19,336
LIAM: You just Babe Ruth-ed that shit!

1232
01:21:19,336 --> 01:21:21,659
MARISHA: Company card, man.

1233
01:21:21,659 --> 01:21:27,111
SAM: We'll probably need sparkling water, stat.
Lots of brandy for the trip.

1234
01:21:27,111 --> 01:21:30,803
TRAVIS: Maybe some servants and some masseuses.

1235
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:38,089
SAM: Yes. I will definitely need someone with a
knowledge of the sea, both in the air and down

1236
01:21:38,089 --> 01:21:39,722
below, the waters below.

1237
01:21:39,722 --> 01:21:47,370
MATT: The captain says, "Actually we've got an
individual just for that." He looks back to the

1238
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:54,145
clerk, "Are you sure?" "Yes, it's fine, not a
worry. We'll talk when they leave."

1239
01:21:54,145 --> 01:22:00,932
TRAVIS: Don't mind me, but I have violence on the
mind at all times. Is there any customary weaponry

1240
01:22:00,932 --> 01:22:05,302
or defense that you can put on this airship during
our travels? Just in case we run into the same

1241
01:22:05,302 --> 01:22:08,224
shit we did last time.

1242
01:22:08,224 --> 01:22:14,615
MATT: The captain goes, "Actually, after the
encounter we had over the Ozmit last time, I

1243
01:22:14,615 --> 01:22:22,656
"managed to outfit this ship with a brand new
series of dragon arbalests, so this is going to be

1244
01:22:22,656 --> 01:22:23,909
"a well-defended journey."

1245
01:22:23,909 --> 01:22:25,479
TRAVIS: Nice. Do they aim in all directions?

1246
01:22:25,479 --> 01:22:26,744
MATT: "You'll see."

1247
01:22:26,744 --> 01:22:27,779
TRAVIS: Nice.

1248
01:22:27,779 --> 01:22:34,505
MATT: And you do recall seeing them when you were
in Vasselheim, you saw them being brought down and

1249
01:22:34,505 --> 01:22:36,849
installed on the ship. But that was last time you
saw the ship.

1250
01:22:36,849 --> 01:22:41,038
SAM: Can the ship be prepared to leave tomorrow
morning?

1251
01:22:41,038 --> 01:22:47,335
MATT: "We can leave in the next hour, if you
want."

1252
01:22:47,335 --> 01:22:51,297
TRAVIS: Stand at the ready, our business is of
great import.

1253
01:22:51,297 --> 01:22:57,489
SAM: Yes, Grog. Yes it is. I think you should ring
the bell to make this an official deal.

1254
01:22:57,489 --> 01:22:58,687
TRAVIS: Can I ring the bell?

1255
01:22:58,687 --> 01:23:00,482
MATT: You can if you want to.

1256
01:23:00,482 --> 01:23:03,778
TRAVIS: But I don't grab it and ring it, I go
(clang) one loud time.

1257
01:23:03,778 --> 01:23:14,649
MATT: The ringing is discordant and painful in
proximity and the clerk went (groaning). The

1258
01:23:14,649 --> 01:23:20,526
captain chuckles to himself. "So. In the
morning."

1259
01:23:20,526 --> 01:23:24,154
SAM: We'll have to discuss with our associates,
but be prepared as quickly as possible.

1260
01:23:24,154 --> 01:23:26,323
MATT: "All right. I'll assemble the crew and we'll
be ready within the hour."

1261
01:23:26,323 --> 01:23:27,824
SAM: Excellent.

1262
01:23:27,824 --> 01:23:35,408
TRAVIS: How many of your crew will you have with
you? Just ballpark it.

1263
01:23:35,408 --> 01:23:44,409
MATT: It would be a crew of eight. "Normally
seven, but we have eight now."

1264
01:23:44,409 --> 01:23:49,174
TRAVIS: And I'm sure this crew is your finest. No
greenhorns. Men you've spent years with, trust

1265
01:23:49,174 --> 01:23:50,067
your life with.

1266
01:23:50,067 --> 01:23:51,188
MATT: "Most of them, yes."

1267
01:23:51,188 --> 01:23:53,726
TRAVIS: Most of them. How many do you not trust
your life with?

1268
01:23:53,726 --> 01:23:56,764
MATT: "There is one we've had on board for a short
time, but she's definitely proven worthy."

1269
01:23:56,764 --> 01:24:01,523
TRAVIS: Perhaps she should stay behind on this
voyage.

1270
01:24:01,601 --> 01:24:04,356
MATT: "She's the one with the mastery of the
ocean."

1271
01:24:04,356 --> 01:24:08,450
TRAVIS: She's coming with us.

1272
01:24:08,517 --> 01:24:15,230
SAM: Thank you, Damon. Oh, one more thing. I asked
you this last time, but are you still single?

1273
01:24:15,298 --> 01:24:17,484
MATT: "Yes?"

1274
01:24:17,484 --> 01:24:19,000
SAM: Okay, good to know.

1275
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,777
TRAVIS: Don't worry about him, there's a hubbub
down in the quarter. People talking. It's the gold

1276
01:24:22,777 --> 01:24:23,807
armor.

1277
01:24:23,807 --> 01:24:25,841
MATT: "I'm going to go ready my ship."

1278
01:24:25,841 --> 01:24:31,853
TRAVIS: Yep. Good! We'll be back. Why did you ask
him if he was single? That was so awkward.

1279
01:24:31,853 --> 01:24:33,965
SAM: Because Vex really liked him last time.

1280
01:24:33,965 --> 01:24:35,972
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know, but he thought you liked
him. Now we have to--

1281
01:24:35,972 --> 01:24:38,646
SAM: You know what, everyone thinks I like them.
That's part of my wink-y charm.

1282
01:24:38,646 --> 01:24:41,049
TRAVIS: I thought you said that it's part of your
winky, I'm like, that's not--

1283
01:24:41,049 --> 01:24:42,471
SAM: (nudge-wink sound)

1284
01:24:42,471 --> 01:24:50,537
MATT: All right. You guys seemingly locked
passage.

1285
01:24:50,537 --> 01:24:52,815
TRAVIS: Boom. For free, bitch! On the house!

1286
01:24:52,815 --> 01:24:54,333
SAM: We could have been using this all over the
place!

1287
01:24:54,333 --> 01:24:56,858
TRAVIS: I know. It's an AmEx Black Card.

1288
01:24:56,858 --> 01:25:00,699
SAM: Real quick, guys. Real quick.

1289
01:25:00,699 --> 01:25:02,105
TRAVIS: We make our way back.

1290
01:25:02,105 --> 01:25:09,489
SAM: Real quick, though, on the way back I'm going
to go to the casino. Just real quick.

1291
01:25:09,489 --> 01:25:10,720
LAURA: (yells) Scanlan!

1292
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:11,996
TALIESIN: No, hold out. Let's see this.

1293
01:25:11,996 --> 01:25:14,180
TRAVIS: Yep. I'm with him. I'm with you.

1294
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:20,823
MATT: Now you, guiding back, head right towards
the Luck's Run.

1295
01:25:20,823 --> 01:25:25,156
TRAVIS: I don't know if this is where our friends
are.

1296
01:25:25,156 --> 01:25:26,541
SAM: It's a shortcut, friend.

1297
01:25:26,541 --> 01:25:27,612
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

1298
01:25:27,612 --> 01:25:33,021
SAM: We get outside, I pull Grog into a little
alleyway and I say: Listen, friend. I'm going to

1299
01:25:33,021 --> 01:25:36,191
go in there and do a little business. Can you do
me a favor?

1300
01:25:36,191 --> 01:25:38,771
TRAVIS: Play some music outside while you go
number two?

1301
01:25:38,771 --> 01:25:44,481
SAM: I need you to keep your eyes open. Can I
Minor Illusion a face of one of those guys who did

1302
01:25:44,481 --> 01:25:46,192
the deal with me?

1303
01:25:46,192 --> 01:25:50,289
MATT: Yeah, you could. It's a still image, it
makes no sound. It's very much an illusion--

1304
01:25:50,289 --> 01:25:57,653
SAM: Yeah, it's for him. To show him what he looks
like. This face, look at it. Lock it in. I do the

1305
01:25:57,653 --> 01:26:00,418
other face as well. This face, you see it?

1306
01:26:00,418 --> 01:26:01,794
TRAVIS: Is there a test on this later?

1307
01:26:01,794 --> 01:26:04,653
SAM: There's only one test. If you see these
people, grab them.

1308
01:26:04,653 --> 01:26:05,976
TRAVIS: Grab them. And then what?

1309
01:26:05,976 --> 01:26:07,989
SAM: Do what Grog does best.

1310
01:26:07,989 --> 01:26:10,792
TRAVIS: Just do what I do best when I see them?

1311
01:26:10,792 --> 01:26:15,697
SAM: Yes. But you won't see them unless they leave
the casino. Just stay out here at the door.

1312
01:26:15,697 --> 01:26:16,520
TRAVIS: Outside?

1313
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:17,493
SAM: Yes.

1314
01:26:17,493 --> 01:26:18,639
TRAVIS: Cool.

1315
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:20,124
SAM: You're my lookout man.

1316
01:26:20,124 --> 01:26:23,736
TRAVIS: Should I have a code word if you know
they're coming out, like--

1317
01:26:23,736 --> 01:26:27,886
SAM: Yeah, let's come up with one right now.
Yeah.

1318
01:26:27,886 --> 01:26:30,575
TRAVIS: Dijon.

1319
01:26:30,575 --> 01:26:33,515
SAM: Yeah. There it is. Dijon.

1320
01:26:33,515 --> 01:26:36,996
MATT: All right. Grog, you taking watch, you head
into the casino.

1321
01:26:36,996 --> 01:26:40,115
SAM: Oh! Before I go in, hat of disguise on.

1322
01:26:40,115 --> 01:26:44,775
MATT: What do you wish to look like?

1323
01:26:44,775 --> 01:26:57,280
SAM: Adult human male. Goatee, pork pie hat, black
jacket. Just an ordinary man.

1324
01:26:57,336 --> 01:26:59,537
LIAM: Yeah, Mr. Shorthalt! Yeah!

1325
01:26:59,537 --> 01:27:02,082
TALIESIN: Is it Abbott or Costello? I'm not sure
which.

1326
01:27:02,082 --> 01:27:07,154
MATT: And you walk into the Luck's Run. Being
midday, it's not as busy as the evening you saw

1327
01:27:07,154 --> 01:27:12,534
previously but I'd say about half the tables are
still running and they have clientele throughout.

1328
01:27:12,534 --> 01:27:18,336
SAM: I'm looking, in the interest of time, going
to look around for any of those two faces.

1329
01:27:18,336 --> 01:27:21,002
MATT: Make a perception check.

1330
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:22,617
LIAM: That's bardic magic, bitch.

1331
01:27:22,617 --> 01:27:23,940
SAM: Nine.

1332
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:31,413
MATT: You spend the better part of a half an hour
scoping through each floor. No sign.

1333
01:27:31,413 --> 01:27:35,024
SAM: I didn't go into their office, though,
right?

1334
01:27:35,024 --> 01:27:40,901
MATT: No. Through the bottom floor, and going up
and checking hallways. And the third floor, which

1335
01:27:40,901 --> 01:27:46,172
you hadn't been before, which is more of a lounge
patio. It has more of the higher stakes games. You

1336
01:27:46,172 --> 01:27:48,550
can see there are some more of the higher rollers
and--

1337
01:27:48,550 --> 01:27:52,466
SAM: And can I make my way to the office area,
where they led me?

1338
01:27:52,466 --> 01:27:54,169
MATT: Yeah. I mean, the door is closed.

1339
01:27:54,169 --> 01:27:55,945
SAM: Can I listen outside?

1340
01:27:55,945 --> 01:27:59,930
MATT: Yeah, you take a listen. Doesn't appear to
be any sound from the other side.

1341
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:00,825
SAM: Damn it.

1342
01:28:00,825 --> 01:28:04,300
TRAVIS: Can I go to the corner where I can see the
front entrance and the side alley where I was and

1343
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:06,570
look and see if I see either of those two faces?

1344
01:28:06,570 --> 01:28:08,301
MATT: Sure, make a perception check.

1345
01:28:08,301 --> 01:28:11,505
TRAVIS: This will go well. Total shit. Six.

1346
01:28:11,505 --> 01:28:14,943
MATT: Six. No sign of them.

1347
01:28:14,943 --> 01:28:17,031
TRAVIS: Cool. I'm looking at the wall.

1348
01:28:17,031 --> 01:28:19,456
SAM: Damn it. All right. I'll quickly Dimension
Door inside the office.

1349
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:26,364
MATT: (whoosh) Inside the office. Thankfully you
have your gnomish dark vision. It is dark in here,

1350
01:28:26,364 --> 01:28:31,201
there are no lights. The table and chairs and the
general decor of the room seemingly untouched

1351
01:28:31,201 --> 01:28:32,604
since last time you were in here.

1352
01:28:32,604 --> 01:28:37,378
SAM: All right. Is there any source of light
around here?

1353
01:28:37,378 --> 01:28:39,794
MATT: There are a couple of lanterns in the corner
that could be lit.

1354
01:28:39,794 --> 01:28:41,078
SAM: I will light one.

1355
01:28:41,078 --> 01:28:46,139
MATT: All right. (whoosh) You turn the lantern up.
Light glows.

1356
01:28:46,139 --> 01:28:52,713
SAM: Going right into the desk, looking for
anything. Keys, gold, contraband, weapons.

1357
01:28:52,713 --> 01:28:54,153
MATT: Investigation check.

1358
01:28:54,153 --> 01:28:56,451
SAM: 23.

1359
01:28:56,451 --> 01:29:09,800
MATT: 23. Scanning through you find the odd four
copper pieces. You find a couple of small books.

1360
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:15,739
One looks like it's on etiquette, and the other is
written in a language you don't understand. But

1361
01:29:15,739 --> 01:29:25,555
you gather it's Marquesian. You do also find some
small notes-- like a little name that is drawn on

1362
01:29:25,555 --> 01:29:29,982
the inside of one of the drawers. Looks old, like
it's been there for a long time, and says "Lelan."

1363
01:29:29,982 --> 01:29:41,897
And you find-- that's about it. You get the sense
this isn't a stationary room that they use as a

1364
01:29:41,897 --> 01:29:44,988
base of operations, it's almost like a rental
space used when people want to come in here and do

1365
01:29:44,988 --> 01:29:48,354
business. Which happens often in a casino
establishment. They want to make sure that they

1366
01:29:48,354 --> 01:29:52,569
provide their clientele with all the necessary
needs, and a lot of the rooms on this center floor

1367
01:29:52,569 --> 01:29:57,814
are to facilitate the meetings between the top and
the bottom.

1368
01:29:57,814 --> 01:30:01,084
SAM: Damn it. All right, I'll do one more
investigation check to see if there's any hidden

1369
01:30:01,084 --> 01:30:04,574
compartments in the desk or around it.

1370
01:30:04,574 --> 01:30:06,971
TRAVIS: Burn it to the ground.

1371
01:30:06,971 --> 01:30:08,627
SAM: 24.

1372
01:30:08,627 --> 01:30:16,367
MATT: 24. Nothing under the desks, but the table
that you're at, there is a small false bottom on

1373
01:30:16,367 --> 01:30:23,597
each side. You pull it open and there is a single
dagger on each end. Apparently for those that

1374
01:30:23,597 --> 01:30:29,622
know, they're provided as a means of defense in
case things in one of these meetings go wrong. But

1375
01:30:29,622 --> 01:30:32,374
who knows who knows this information. It looks
like they haven't been used in a while.

1376
01:30:32,374 --> 01:30:33,207
SAM: All right.

1377
01:30:33,207 --> 01:30:35,206
TRAVIS: Can I look around and see if I see the two
faces now?

1378
01:30:35,206 --> 01:30:37,913
MATT: Sure, make another perception check.

1379
01:30:37,913 --> 01:30:40,034
TRAVIS: 18.

1380
01:30:40,034 --> 01:30:41,550
MATT: Nope.

1381
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:50,773
SAM: All right, fine. I will take the daggers,
take the Marquesian book, whatever that was, take

1382
01:30:50,773 --> 01:30:59,889
a huge dump on the desk, and take one of the
daggers and dig a big piece of it and write on the

1383
01:30:59,889 --> 01:31:02,011
wall, "The Meat Man cometh."

1384
01:31:02,011 --> 01:31:03,774
(laughing)

1385
01:31:03,774 --> 01:31:07,803
TALIESIN: Wouldn't it be, "The Meat Man goeth?" Oh
well, never mind.

1386
01:31:07,803 --> 01:31:09,804
SAM: And then I'll let myself out.

1387
01:31:09,804 --> 01:31:18,121
MATT: Okay. You open the door. There are two
people walking through. They glance over at you

1388
01:31:18,121 --> 01:31:23,331
and keep walking. You close the door behind you
and you have left your mark.

1389
01:31:23,331 --> 01:31:27,070
SAM: Okay. On the way out of the casino do I see
any familiar faces?

1390
01:31:27,070 --> 01:31:28,718
MATT: Make a perception check.

1391
01:31:28,718 --> 01:31:29,836
SAM: 18!

1392
01:31:29,836 --> 01:31:30,954
MATT: 18. Nah.

1393
01:31:30,954 --> 01:31:32,101
SAM: Ah, fuck you!

1394
01:31:32,101 --> 01:31:35,802
MATT: They seemingly know better than to return to
the scene of the crime.

1395
01:31:35,802 --> 01:31:37,813
SAM: All right.

1396
01:31:37,813 --> 01:31:44,864
MATT: For lesser folk, 400 gold can keep you going
for quite some time.

1397
01:31:44,864 --> 01:31:47,208
TRAVIS: Put some money on red or black while
you're in there. Just once.

1398
01:31:47,208 --> 01:31:50,193
SAM: All right.

1399
01:31:50,193 --> 01:31:53,396
LAURA: You should try the dice game just once.

1400
01:31:53,396 --> 01:31:54,944
SAM: The dice game?

1401
01:31:54,944 --> 01:31:55,845
LAURA: Yeah.

1402
01:31:55,845 --> 01:31:56,868
SAM: All right. Grog?

1403
01:31:56,868 --> 01:31:57,848
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1404
01:31:57,848 --> 01:32:00,244
SAM: Want to come in and play once with me?

1405
01:32:00,244 --> 01:32:01,268
TRAVIS: No.

1406
01:32:01,268 --> 01:32:02,437
SAM: Okay, great.

1407
01:32:02,437 --> 01:32:04,606
(laughter)

1408
01:32:04,606 --> 01:32:06,026
SAM: I'll do the dice game once.

1409
01:32:06,026 --> 01:32:12,584
MATT: Okay, all right. So you walk in to the
table. There's three other individuals there. Hold

1410
01:32:12,584 --> 01:32:17,585
on, let me get prepared here. Since this is the
first time we're really doing this here, which is

1411
01:32:17,585 --> 01:32:20,156
kind of fun. All righty.

1412
01:32:20,156 --> 01:32:21,670
TALIESIN: No, this is like, the third run.

1413
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:23,405
LAURA: Isn't this the seven or the twelve game?

1414
01:32:23,405 --> 01:32:25,758
MATT: Oh, the dice game! Dice game, I'm sorry.

1415
01:32:25,758 --> 01:32:28,364
SAM: What's the other game?

1416
01:32:28,364 --> 01:32:32,806
MATT: Well the dice game's cool. There's the dice
game, the lizards, and the card game. Your call.

1417
01:32:32,806 --> 01:32:34,177
MARISHA: What's the card game?

1418
01:32:34,177 --> 01:32:35,354
MATT: Dice game is the 2d6--

1419
01:32:35,354 --> 01:32:38,159
SAM: What's the fastest one? Let's do that one.

1420
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:39,990
MATT: The fastest one is the dice game. The card
game takes a little more time.

1421
01:32:39,990 --> 01:32:41,298
SAM: Okay.

1422
01:32:41,298 --> 01:32:46,262
MATT: All right, so. That is a 25 gold minimum buy
in for Avandra's Favor.

1423
01:32:46,262 --> 01:32:48,160
TRAVIS: Even in the middle of the day, the
minimums don't go down?

1424
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:50,202
LAURA: I know, I feel like the minimums should go
down in the middle of the day.

1425
01:32:50,202 --> 01:32:51,304
SAM: 50 gold.

1426
01:32:51,304 --> 01:32:52,793
MATT: You've never been to Ank'Harel!

1427
01:32:52,793 --> 01:32:54,688
SAM: 50 gold!

1428
01:32:54,688 --> 01:32:56,172
TRAVIS: Well I've been to Harrah's!

1429
01:32:56,172 --> 01:32:57,953
MATT: The minimums stay where they are.

1430
01:32:57,953 --> 01:32:59,225
SAM: 50 gold.

1431
01:32:59,225 --> 01:33:05,526
MATT: All right, you throw 50 gold down. As you
slap it down, still in your human guise, an

1432
01:33:05,526 --> 01:33:12,718
individual to the left of you goes, "Whew. All
right. Big, strong opening and strong scent."

1433
01:33:12,718 --> 01:33:17,485
Scoots over a bit to the right. Go ahead and roll
your dice.

1434
01:33:17,485 --> 01:33:18,910
SAM: Six.

1435
01:33:18,910 --> 01:33:19,939
MATT: Six.

1436
01:33:19,939 --> 01:33:21,031
LAURA: Double down!

1437
01:33:21,031 --> 01:33:23,195
MATT: He goes, "Mm. That's unfortunate."

1438
01:33:23,195 --> 01:33:24,876
TALIESIN: Six is the double down, isn't it? Six is
the double down.

1439
01:33:24,876 --> 01:33:25,806
LAURA: Yeah!

1440
01:33:25,806 --> 01:33:28,865
MATT: "You can go ahead and double the price to
add an additional 1d6. You're going for seven or 12."

1441
01:33:28,865 --> 01:33:30,556
SAM: Sure, yeah.

1442
01:33:30,556 --> 01:33:31,963
TALIESIN: So roll one more die.

1443
01:33:31,963 --> 01:33:34,681
MATT: "So 100 gold on the table. Roll one more
dice. You want a one--"

1444
01:33:34,681 --> 01:33:36,173
MARISHA: --or a six.

1445
01:33:36,173 --> 01:33:37,773
SAM: I got a five.

1446
01:33:37,773 --> 01:33:38,882
MARISHA: Aww.

1447
01:33:38,882 --> 01:33:43,673
MATT: "I am very sorry my friend." Shifts the coin
away. 100 gold down now.

1448
01:33:43,673 --> 01:33:47,677
SAM: I just say: I hate this casino.

1449
01:33:47,677 --> 01:33:49,561
(laughter)

1450
01:33:49,561 --> 01:33:51,305
MATT: Any other games you want to play?

1451
01:33:51,305 --> 01:34:02,500
SAM: No! No, I leave. Goddammit. Wait, what was
the names? The names that they gave me? The two

1452
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:04,226
guys gave me?

1453
01:34:04,226 --> 01:34:06,007
MATT: Oh! Oh, right.

1454
01:34:06,007 --> 01:34:07,177
SAM: Grug, or something.

1455
01:34:07,177 --> 01:34:15,170
MATT: That was Rutur was the half orc. And I have
to go look up what the other one was.

1456
01:34:15,170 --> 01:34:20,905
SAM: It's fine. I'll ask the dealer, or the dicer,
if he's seen Rutur around.

1457
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:23,602
MATT: He kind of--

1458
01:34:23,602 --> 01:34:30,891
SAM: Jesus Christ. Five more gold.

1459
01:34:30,891 --> 01:34:38,087
MATT: "Ah, yes. Rutur makes his way around here on
occasion. Every couple weeks, maybe."

1460
01:34:38,087 --> 01:34:40,211
(laughter)

1461
01:34:40,211 --> 01:34:43,169
LIAM: This city has had its way with you, Scanlan
Shorthalt.

1462
01:34:43,169 --> 01:34:45,062
TALIESIN: You're never going to get a kiss.

1463
01:34:45,062 --> 01:34:47,324
TRAVIS: Take your finger out of my asshole, Gary.

1464
01:34:47,324 --> 01:34:50,679
MATT: "He doesn't seem to carry much change with
him."

1465
01:34:50,679 --> 01:34:55,490
(laughter)

1466
01:34:55,490 --> 01:34:59,172
SAM: Are you trying to do this to me on purpose?

1467
01:34:59,172 --> 01:35:03,558
MATT: He looks at you strangely. "Hm?"

1468
01:35:03,558 --> 01:35:06,272
LIAM: You talking to Matt?

1469
01:35:06,272 --> 01:35:08,203
MATT: You keep coming back man, I don't know.

1470
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:10,629
SAM: Fine.

1471
01:35:10,629 --> 01:35:13,827
TRAVIS: Do I see any half orcs outside?

1472
01:35:13,827 --> 01:35:16,502
MATT: You do not at the moment.

1473
01:35:16,502 --> 01:35:17,591
TRAVIS: Damn it.

1474
01:35:17,591 --> 01:35:21,612
MATT: There is still Quon A Drensal or Gambit of
Ord if you're feeling lucky and you want to make

1475
01:35:21,612 --> 01:35:22,571
your money back.

1476
01:35:22,571 --> 01:35:33,042
SAM: Not in a million years, no! This place, it
sucks all my mojo. It's like the anti-mojo.

1477
01:35:33,042 --> 01:35:37,641
TALIESIN: I feel a valuable lesson has finally
been learned, for the first time in this game.

1478
01:35:37,641 --> 01:35:43,822
SAM: All right, I leave. And I go out and I say,
Grog, let's go home. But before we do, slap me in

1479
01:35:43,822 --> 01:35:45,129
the face really hard.

1480
01:35:45,129 --> 01:35:46,011
TRAVIS: You're sure?

1481
01:35:46,011 --> 01:35:47,391
SAM: Yes, I need it. I need it.

1482
01:35:47,391 --> 01:35:49,377
TRAVIS: Really hard. You want me to use the
gauntlets or no?

1483
01:35:49,377 --> 01:35:50,176
SAM: No.

1484
01:35:50,176 --> 01:35:52,111
LIAM: If he doesn't roll for damage then I'm going
to be offended.

1485
01:35:52,111 --> 01:35:58,602
TRAVIS: All right, I take the Titanstone Knuckle
off my left hand and I slap him.

1486
01:35:58,602 --> 01:36:02,479
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll a strength
check.

1487
01:36:02,479 --> 01:36:07,546
TRAVIS: 18.

1488
01:36:07,546 --> 01:36:13,126
MATT: All right. You take five points of damage.

1489
01:36:13,126 --> 01:36:18,188
TALIESIN: Is he still wearing the disguise? Is he
wearing the hat of disguise?

1490
01:36:18,188 --> 01:36:19,277
SAM: Yes. Of course.

1491
01:36:19,277 --> 01:36:20,172
MATT: He is.

1492
01:36:20,172 --> 01:36:22,252
TALIESIN: So would his head not be, necessarily,
where his--

1493
01:36:22,252 --> 01:36:27,474
MATT: That's true, and with Grog being not the one
who would remember that or recall that, he goes--

1494
01:36:27,474 --> 01:36:31,993
SAM: I can't even get slapped in the face right!

1495
01:36:31,993 --> 01:36:35,115
TALIESIN: I will ruin everything! I will ruin
everything!

1496
01:36:35,115 --> 01:36:37,189
MATT: It's a valid point, thank you for
remembering.

1497
01:36:37,189 --> 01:36:40,019
TRAVIS: I was so confused why a stranger would ask
me to slap him.

1498
01:36:40,019 --> 01:36:44,107
(laughter)

1499
01:36:44,107 --> 01:36:45,941
SAM: We go home.

1500
01:36:45,941 --> 01:36:51,376
LIAM: Wait. So way faster than the casino trip,
while we've been waiting so long, Percival has

1501
01:36:51,376 --> 01:36:55,498
been acting fucking twitchy since we found that
body so I walk over to him sitting off at a table.

1502
01:36:55,498 --> 01:37:01,512
Hey, Mr. Cool-as-a-cucumber. Shush. Or come with
me, come have a seat.

1503
01:37:01,512 --> 01:37:03,186
LAURA: Okay, all right, I'm here.

1504
01:37:03,186 --> 01:37:09,400
LIAM: What's the matter? Yeah, it's her again.
We're going to find her. It's fine. You're huffing

1505
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:14,641
and hawing since we found her body. It's fine.
What's going on?

1506
01:37:14,641 --> 01:37:26,517
TALIESIN: I was really hoping she was going to go
away. That's all. I was really hoping that she was

1507
01:37:26,517 --> 01:37:28,116
just going to go away.

1508
01:37:28,116 --> 01:37:30,459
LIAM: Well she's going to go away, Percival. If
not now, later.

1509
01:37:30,459 --> 01:37:45,861
TALIESIN: Every second she's alive is untold
damage to the world. Do you know how every now and

1510
01:37:45,861 --> 01:37:48,035
then I say something awful?

1511
01:37:48,035 --> 01:37:49,398
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

1512
01:37:49,398 --> 01:37:59,817
TALIESIN: I love you both very much for that. When
I think of that terrible person inside of me I see

1513
01:37:59,817 --> 01:38:15,607
her face. She has a very active imagination. She
knows how to make these machines, and her

1514
01:38:15,607 --> 01:38:31,512
imagination terrifies me. If you knew that that
was me, would you let me live? Has she made ten

1515
01:38:31,512 --> 01:38:39,698
more of these things, has she made 100? Does she
hand them out to people? Maybe, I don't know,

1516
01:38:39,698 --> 01:38:45,869
maybe she's running around and torturing people's
parents and siblings to death and then handing

1517
01:38:45,869 --> 01:38:49,176
them a gun and kicking them out into the world to
see what will happen because it could be funny.

1518
01:38:49,176 --> 01:38:55,031
LIAM: You're probably right, Percival. She
probably is. This is not Lord and Lady Briarwood

1519
01:38:55,031 --> 01:38:56,495
over again, though.

1520
01:38:56,495 --> 01:38:57,487
TALIESIN: No, it's not.

1521
01:38:57,487 --> 01:38:58,859
LIAM: And you're not alone.

1522
01:38:58,859 --> 01:38:59,905
TALIESIN: No, I'm not.

1523
01:38:59,905 --> 01:39:04,601
LIAM: You have me, you have her. You have her. You
have the other two Laurel and Hardy motherfuckers

1524
01:39:04,601 --> 01:39:05,631
who aren't back yet.

1525
01:39:05,631 --> 01:39:07,417
TALIESIN: I was so hoping that maybe--

1526
01:39:07,417 --> 01:39:11,811
MARISHA: I slam some mead in front of him.

1527
01:39:11,811 --> 01:39:16,650
TALIESIN: Thank you. I was hoping something heavy
had fallen on her from a great height, saving the

1528
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:20,089
world a few thousand lives.

1529
01:39:20,089 --> 01:39:25,030
LAURA: Well, we're going to be above her. Maybe we
can be the one to drop something heavy.

1530
01:39:25,030 --> 01:39:26,956
TALIESIN: That's really what I'm hoping.

1531
01:39:26,956 --> 01:39:29,928
MARISHA: Oh, I've been practicing that actually. I
can be really heavy.

1532
01:39:29,928 --> 01:39:31,224
TALIESIN: That may help.

1533
01:39:31,224 --> 01:39:31,975
MARISHA: Yeah.

1534
01:39:31,975 --> 01:39:38,985
TALIESIN: She is the biggest mistake I've made,
and I'm horrified by who's paid the price.

1535
01:39:38,985 --> 01:39:43,817
LIAM: All the more reason for you to be the same
cold-hearted asshole you've been for the last

1536
01:39:43,817 --> 01:39:47,567
year. Why change now? Get the job done, Percival.

1537
01:39:47,567 --> 01:39:49,675
TALIESIN: I'm counting to a hundred. I'll be
fine.

1538
01:39:49,675 --> 01:39:52,989
MARISHA: It's not very often we see you shaky,
Percy.

1539
01:39:52,989 --> 01:39:59,460
TALIESIN: Once we're out of here, I'll feel fine.
Once that thing is off my machine I will feel

1540
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:06,514
fine. And I'm thinking of something else. I'm
thinking of building something awful to help deal

1541
01:40:06,514 --> 01:40:07,707
with her.

1542
01:40:07,707 --> 01:40:13,681
MARISHA: Hang on. Wait. Hang on. I was about to
ask if you ever have regrets of building something

1543
01:40:13,681 --> 01:40:18,550
awful and releasing it into this world, and now
you just said you're going to double down,

1544
01:40:18,550 --> 01:40:19,752
essentially?

1545
01:40:19,752 --> 01:40:26,993
TALIESIN: I've been thinking long and hard about
it. I think inevitably, anytime I think of

1546
01:40:26,993 --> 01:40:33,854
something it might be too late. I think I'm going
to be very careful about what I build. I'm going

1547
01:40:33,854 --> 01:40:41,745
to be very careful about where it goes, and I'm
also going to ask anybody, if-- when I die, destroy

1548
01:40:41,745 --> 01:40:50,491
everything. Please. This is why I don't write down
notes. Any of my sketches, they're put away, and

1549
01:40:50,491 --> 01:40:58,866
they're put in a place where I can remove them
once the job is done. But I sketch my idle

1550
01:40:58,866 --> 01:41:04,569
thoughts, and right now I'm having an idle thought
for her and it's simple, it's nothing complicated,

1551
01:41:04,569 --> 01:41:06,395
it's just vicious.

1552
01:41:06,395 --> 01:41:11,658
LIAM: Well all right, we can do that. We can
destroy anything you make, but for now, Percy.

1553
01:41:11,658 --> 01:41:14,499
Keep your head, man.

1554
01:41:14,499 --> 01:41:16,266
TALIESIN: One night of sleep, I'll be there.

1555
01:41:16,266 --> 01:41:22,164
MARISHA: What exactly are you thinking of making?
Just because we could destroy your notes, I mean,

1556
01:41:22,164 --> 01:41:26,714
you're still alive and your guns still got into
the world.

1557
01:41:26,714 --> 01:41:35,317
LAURA: Regardless of what he makes, who wields it?
Fenthras is a horrible weapon wielded by a

1558
01:41:35,317 --> 01:41:40,784
horrible being before I had it. A gun can do the
same thing.

1559
01:41:40,784 --> 01:41:45,784
MARISHA: You're arguably one of the greatest minds
in existence right now, Percival.

1560
01:41:45,784 --> 01:41:47,688
TALIESIN: That's a terrible thought.

1561
01:41:47,688 --> 01:41:52,270
MARISHA: But you are. And Vex isn't wrong.

1562
01:41:52,270 --> 01:42:01,428
TALIESIN: I know. There are things that one day I
will speak of that I'm not really ready to deal

1563
01:42:01,428 --> 01:42:06,605
with yet. But I think I may even have something
that could help us with the dragons. I have a

1564
01:42:06,605 --> 01:42:10,797
thought. I'm going to work on it on our way to the
island.

1565
01:42:10,797 --> 01:42:12,316
LIAM: Now I'm nervous.

1566
01:42:12,316 --> 01:42:20,307
TALIESIN: It will be something that once the
dragons are felled I plan on destroying

1567
01:42:20,307 --> 01:42:28,122
immediately after. And I think you'll be all right
with it when you see it, it's too complicated for

1568
01:42:28,122 --> 01:42:32,767
any one person to really deal with. But I will
feel much better if she is in the ground.

1569
01:42:32,767 --> 01:42:34,440
LAURA: Well I'm interested in seeing it.

1570
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:40,932
MARISHA: Percy. You know you can talk to us,
right? You never share ideas with us.

1571
01:42:40,932 --> 01:42:45,784
TALIESIN: I do. I told you my idea of killing all
the dragonborn to start a war between the

1572
01:42:45,784 --> 01:42:47,210
dragons.

1573
01:42:47,210 --> 01:42:48,887
MARISHA: All right, well.

1574
01:42:48,887 --> 01:42:51,255
TALIESIN: That's why I don't share those ideas,
I'm not proud of them.

1575
01:42:51,255 --> 01:42:57,014
LAURA: Is this thing you're building going to kill
a lot of people in addition to the dragon?

1576
01:42:57,014 --> 01:43:02,864
TALIESIN: I hope not, but it could. It could make
it very easy to kill a lot of people.

1577
01:43:02,864 --> 01:43:08,851
LIAM: One day at a time, gang. Let's deal with
Ripley first.

1578
01:43:08,851 --> 01:43:15,249
TALIESIN: Let's deal with Ripley. Let's collect a
few more things that will help us deal with home.

1579
01:43:15,249 --> 01:43:25,681
Let's save home. And then I will spend some good
time undoing some of the damage that I've done. I

1580
01:43:25,681 --> 01:43:27,991
should have killed her. I should have.

1581
01:43:27,991 --> 01:43:37,408
MARISHA: You shouldn't feel regret about not
taking another person's life. It's a moment of

1582
01:43:37,408 --> 01:43:38,746
humanity.

1583
01:43:38,746 --> 01:43:43,633
TALIESIN: It wasn't. I was not being kind, I was
being selfish. I didn't kill her because the

1584
01:43:43,633 --> 01:43:48,858
Briarwoods mattered more to me, even though I
knew that she was far more dangerous. That if

1585
01:43:48,858 --> 01:43:56,424
they had escaped, the world would be darker, two
more vampires or whatever, but she was the genie

1586
01:43:56,424 --> 01:44:05,603
and I knowingly and very willingly said, I'm fine
with that. And I knew at that moment, this was not

1587
01:44:05,603 --> 01:44:10,904
a thought I had later, in my head, I went, she is
going to kill hundreds of people. And that's okay

1588
01:44:10,904 --> 01:44:11,979
right now.

1589
01:44:11,979 --> 01:44:18,995
LAURA: Percy, if you had stayed with her and let
the Briarwoods go, a god, a terrible god, would

1590
01:44:18,995 --> 01:44:21,773
probably be loosed on the land right now. I
think you chose correctly.

1591
01:44:21,773 --> 01:44:26,306
TALIESIN: I think I stumbled into the correct
answer, I'm not sure I chose correctly. I think I

1592
01:44:26,306 --> 01:44:27,823
got lucky.

1593
01:44:27,823 --> 01:44:33,897
MARISHA: Did you not want to kill her because in a
way you feel responsible for who she is?

1594
01:44:33,897 --> 01:44:40,205
TALIESIN: Oh, I feel absolutely responsible for
inspiring a maniac, of course I do.

1595
01:44:40,205 --> 01:44:45,436
LIAM: Look. We're going to help you get to her.
You're going to get her. You've got to let us in

1596
01:44:45,436 --> 01:44:47,264
on it a bit, though, all right?

1597
01:44:47,264 --> 01:44:52,751
TALIESIN: Once I have something drawn I'll show
you what it is. And I'll have something drawn by

1598
01:44:52,751 --> 01:44:54,109
tomorrow. Something simple.

1599
01:44:54,109 --> 01:44:55,188
LIAM: That's a promise?

1600
01:44:55,188 --> 01:44:56,188
TALIESIN: That is absolutely a promise.

1601
01:44:56,188 --> 01:45:00,531
MARISHA: Also I know you're really smart, but
we're smart too. Don't insult our intelligence by

1602
01:45:00,531 --> 01:45:04,216
assuming we can't comprehend one of your ideas.

1603
01:45:04,216 --> 01:45:10,484
TALIESIN: Oh no you'll comprehend it, and it's not
that I don't think you can comprehend it, I know

1604
01:45:10,484 --> 01:45:14,942
you can, it's that I know what it says about me
that I even thought it.

1605
01:45:14,942 --> 01:45:19,170
MARISHA: Percy. Percy.

1606
01:45:19,170 --> 01:45:21,101
TALIESIN: You've been drinking.

1607
01:45:21,101 --> 01:45:22,340
MARISHA: I have!

1608
01:45:22,340 --> 01:45:27,828
LAURA: Oh, Keyleth! Really? Hold off of the
alcohol. We have a lot to do today.

1609
01:45:27,828 --> 01:45:30,499
MARISHA: We've been through so much!

1610
01:45:30,499 --> 01:45:34,893
LIAM: I think my point has been made. I start
moving Keyleth towards that door for some fresh air.

1611
01:45:34,893 --> 01:45:36,758
LAURA: Please, get her some fresh air.

1612
01:45:36,758 --> 01:45:38,186
MARISHA: I want more mead!

1613
01:45:38,186 --> 01:45:39,241
LIAM: Come on.

1614
01:45:39,241 --> 01:45:40,518
TALIESIN: I'm sorry I'm an idiot.

1615
01:45:40,518 --> 01:45:42,681
MARISHA: I love you, but I hate you, but I love
you.

1616
01:45:42,681 --> 01:45:43,952
LAURA: Percy.

1617
01:45:43,952 --> 01:45:45,705
TALIESIN: I'm fond of you as well. Yes, dear.

1618
01:45:45,705 --> 01:45:47,270
LAURA: You're a better man than you believe.

1619
01:45:47,270 --> 01:45:58,336
TALIESIN: Thank you. I accept that compliment. You
as well, you are a better woman than you believe.

1620
01:45:58,336 --> 01:46:01,269
Doesn't feel good, does it? There you are.

1621
01:46:01,269 --> 01:46:02,907
LAURA: No, it doesn't. Shit.

1622
01:46:02,907 --> 01:46:05,110
TALIESIN: That's what you get for saying things
like that. Terrible person.

1623
01:46:05,110 --> 01:46:07,640
LIAM: Thought for a second you also had one ball.

1624
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:12,795
MATT: All right. So your companions arrive.

1625
01:46:12,795 --> 01:46:14,007
TRAVIS: We're back!

1626
01:46:14,007 --> 01:46:18,580
SAM: We're back. Good news, Grog sweet-talked them
into giving us an airship for free.

1627
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:19,949
LIAM: No shit, Grog!

1628
01:46:19,949 --> 01:46:21,213
SAM: Grog did the whole thing himself.

1629
01:46:21,213 --> 01:46:22,063
LAURA: Wait, what?!

1630
01:46:22,063 --> 01:46:22,873
LIAM: How did you do it?

1631
01:46:22,873 --> 01:46:29,623
TRAVIS: Well, it's a very intricate and detailed
process. Involves a lot of-- you know what? It'll

1632
01:46:29,623 --> 01:46:33,002
be all over your heads, so just say thank you.

1633
01:46:33,002 --> 01:46:36,008
SAM: Let's just say that he's a good reader of
body language.

1634
01:46:36,008 --> 01:46:37,446
LAURA: What the fuck did you do? Did you really?

1635
01:46:37,446 --> 01:46:39,254
SAM: We got an airship for free.

1636
01:46:39,254 --> 01:46:40,532
LIAM: Who's excited now?

1637
01:46:40,532 --> 01:46:42,965
TALIESIN: I'm very excited, that's the best thing
I've heard all day.

1638
01:46:42,965 --> 01:46:44,321
LAURA: Did you steal it? Tell me you didn't do
anything--

1639
01:46:44,321 --> 01:46:50,462
SAM: We did nothing illegal. And to sweeten the
deal, Captain Damon will be our Damon pilot.

1640
01:46:50,462 --> 01:46:52,572
TALIESIN: That Captain Damon.

1641
01:46:52,572 --> 01:46:54,088
TRAVIS: "Our Damon pilot."

1642
01:46:54,088 --> 01:46:59,055
MARISHA: Did you tell him we were the ones with
the wyverns? Because that's what I would have told

1643
01:46:59,055 --> 01:47:02,179
him. Had I been there, theoretically.

1644
01:47:02,179 --> 01:47:04,746
SAM: That thought popped right into my head.

1645
01:47:04,746 --> 01:47:06,004
MARISHA: Really? Okay.

1646
01:47:06,004 --> 01:47:12,574
SAM: And on the way back I won back the 50 gold I
lost on the fusaka.

1647
01:47:12,574 --> 01:47:13,474
TRAVIS: You did!

1648
01:47:13,474 --> 01:47:14,339
SAM: Yeah, yep.

1649
01:47:14,339 --> 01:47:15,416
TALIESIN: Well done!

1650
01:47:15,416 --> 01:47:18,711
SAM: So I'm going to leave Marquet totally
evens.

1651
01:47:18,711 --> 01:47:20,972
LAURA: That's great!

1652
01:47:20,972 --> 01:47:21,911
TALIESIN: That's amazing.

1653
01:47:21,911 --> 01:47:23,067
SAM: Yup, pretty good.

1654
01:47:23,067 --> 01:47:24,055
TALIESIN: I wish I could say that.

1655
01:47:24,055 --> 01:47:25,192
LIAM: Oh cheers to that, cheers.

1656
01:47:25,192 --> 01:47:30,380
SAM: Still batting a thousand, this guy. Unstoppable
me!

1657
01:47:30,380 --> 01:47:33,078
TRAVIS: Now we can leave whenever we're ready.

1658
01:47:33,078 --> 01:47:34,596
SAM: Oh, yeah, let's pack our bags.

1659
01:47:34,596 --> 01:47:35,520
LAURA: Right now?

1660
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:37,086
SAM: Oh, wait no, we still have to de-curse the
thing.

1661
01:47:37,086 --> 01:47:38,736
LAURA: Oh the enchantment! Right. We're waiting on
that, that's why we're fucking here.

1662
01:47:38,736 --> 01:47:42,129
MATT: You guys go back down to the main area?

1663
01:47:42,129 --> 01:47:43,379
LIAM: So many things.

1664
01:47:43,379 --> 01:47:48,126
LAURA: Shall we bring the weapon down there?

1665
01:47:48,126 --> 01:47:49,579
LIAM: That seems like a bad idea.

1666
01:47:49,579 --> 01:47:51,601
TALIESIN: Once they're here. Actually, yes, why
not?

1667
01:47:51,601 --> 01:47:54,511
LAURA: Yay, then Trinket's with us again.

1668
01:47:54,511 --> 01:47:59,388
MATT: Yes. All so you guys head back down to the
main thoroughfare, or the main area of the

1669
01:47:59,388 --> 01:48:00,884
tavern?

1670
01:48:00,884 --> 01:48:01,957
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1671
01:48:01,957 --> 01:48:09,861
MATT: There you see the same folks are there. You
see Treev is there, and you see a shifty-looking

1672
01:48:09,861 --> 01:48:19,709
guy. A rather pointed nose, very shallow features.
And his hands are together, he has a satchel over

1673
01:48:19,709 --> 01:48:25,272
his shoulder, and these long, plain looking robes.
And his thinning, short, dark hair is slicked

1674
01:48:25,272 --> 01:48:30,820
against his skull. He has a thin mustache goatee
right there, and he's sitting at the edge of the

1675
01:48:30,820 --> 01:48:32,186
bar, talking to Treev.

1676
01:48:32,186 --> 01:48:33,732
LAURA: So he looks totally trustworthy.

1677
01:48:33,732 --> 01:48:34,990
MATT: Totally trustworthy.

1678
01:48:34,990 --> 01:48:36,971
MATT: As soon as you guys walk down the stairs--

1679
01:48:36,971 --> 01:48:39,663
LIAM: Is he that picture of you on the carousel?

1680
01:48:39,663 --> 01:48:42,271
MATT: Basically yes, but with the shorter slicked
hair.

1681
01:48:42,271 --> 01:48:44,780
TALIESIN: I'm glad that's a thing again. I really
missed that.

1682
01:48:44,780 --> 01:48:48,708
MATT: I don't know how to take that actually,
based on how I just described the NPC.

1683
01:48:48,708 --> 01:48:50,836
LIAM: It's more the grimace.

1684
01:48:50,836 --> 01:48:54,604
TALIESIN: I suddenly can hear thousands of Twitch
viewers Googling. Googling like mad!

1685
01:48:54,604 --> 01:48:55,922
MATT: Noted.

1686
01:48:55,922 --> 01:48:57,783
LIAM: Whoops. "And then Vax died."

1687
01:48:57,783 --> 01:49:04,504
MATT: Disadvantage for the rest of the episode.
No. Treev goes, "Oh and here they are, the ones

1688
01:49:04,504 --> 01:49:12,685
"who hired your help. Folks, I'd like to introduce
you to Kyme, he's one of our fine allies in the

1689
01:49:12,685 --> 01:49:19,356
"Omnival Library here in the city, and I believe he
can take care of your little problem. So talk."

1690
01:49:19,356 --> 01:49:27,881
And the guy spins around on the stool at the edge
of the bar, and goes, "Okay, so I have been told

1691
01:49:27,881 --> 01:49:39,328
"that you require some sort of disenchantment
type thing. Who am I talking to here? There's a

1692
01:49:39,453 --> 01:49:43,552
"lot of you. You? Okay, come."

1693
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:52,151
TALIESIN: All right. I have an object-- so
hard to talk to that face.

1694
01:49:52,151 --> 01:49:56,450
LAURA: Scanlan. He seems like the type, you might
want to try selling him some of that fusaka.

1695
01:49:56,450 --> 01:50:00,853
TALIESIN: I have an object that I own that someone
is tracking me with. They are aware of my

1696
01:50:00,853 --> 01:50:05,038
whereabouts, they've put some kind of enchantment
on it. I was wondering if I could transfer that

1697
01:50:05,038 --> 01:50:10,107
enchantment to another object, and send it in a
different direction so that they don't know that we're

1698
01:50:10,107 --> 01:50:11,902
following them.

1699
01:50:11,902 --> 01:50:14,459
MATT: "That's possible, yes."

1700
01:50:14,459 --> 01:50:19,060
TALIESIN: I would even be willing, if possible, to
remove part of the object that I currently own,

1701
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:21,970
and then replace it with something else if
necessary.

1702
01:50:21,970 --> 01:50:27,536
MATT: "Depending on the strength of the
enchantment, that can take anywhere within the

1703
01:50:27,536 --> 01:50:29,570
"next few weeks."

1704
01:50:29,570 --> 01:50:31,369
TALIESIN: Can I get you a drink? Are you all
right?

1705
01:50:31,369 --> 01:50:33,574
MATT: "Why? Why do you ask?"

1706
01:50:33,574 --> 01:50:34,692
LAURA: Can I insight check him?

1707
01:50:34,692 --> 01:50:35,818
MATT: Make an insight check, yeah.

1708
01:50:35,818 --> 01:50:38,424
LIAM: Yay.

1709
01:50:38,424 --> 01:50:47,271
SAM: May I make a physiological check of his mouth
shape? His jaw seems--

1710
01:50:47,271 --> 01:50:49,715
LIAM: New Matt character!

1711
01:50:49,715 --> 01:50:51,528
TALIESIN: I know.

1712
01:50:51,528 --> 01:50:54,355
LAURA: 19.

1713
01:50:54,355 --> 01:50:56,134
MATT: 19.

1714
01:50:56,134 --> 01:51:01,810
SAM: You know at shop.geekandsundry.com, there's a
lot of new items up for sale.

1715
01:51:01,810 --> 01:51:02,942
MARISHA: That's true.

1716
01:51:02,942 --> 01:51:04,094
TALIESIN: There's the mug.

1717
01:51:04,094 --> 01:51:06,116
LIAM: Do they have the model airship yet?

1718
01:51:06,116 --> 01:51:07,568
SAM: There's the mug, there's rings, patches.
What?

1719
01:51:07,568 --> 01:51:08,683
LIAM: The model airship?

1720
01:51:08,683 --> 01:51:16,687
SAM: The model airship, it's life-sized. Nail wraps
by Espionage Cosmetics, only 12 dollars. And don't

1721
01:51:16,687 --> 01:51:21,508
forget, one week left on pre-orders for those
silicon bracelets and the enamel pins guys.

1722
01:51:21,508 --> 01:51:23,138
MATT: All righty.

1723
01:51:23,138 --> 01:51:25,214
SAM: Backblaze!

1724
01:51:25,214 --> 01:51:31,760
TALIESIN: So I'm going to show him the gun, and
I'm going to say, what do you think? And I'm going

1725
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:33,307
to show him where the enchantment is.

1726
01:51:33,307 --> 01:51:35,164
SAM: You're showing him the gun? We just said
don't show people the gun.

1727
01:51:35,164 --> 01:51:36,853
LAURA: We need to remove the enchantment from it.

1728
01:51:36,853 --> 01:51:37,670
SAM: Okay.

1729
01:51:37,670 --> 01:51:41,719
LAURA: If we can remove the enchantment, if it
takes a long time to transfer, maybe you can keep

1730
01:51:41,719 --> 01:51:44,253
transferring it after we've left? Is that a
thing?

1731
01:51:44,253 --> 01:51:52,631
MATT: "I can get rid of the enchantment
immediately, but it's gone. Transfer, that's a

1732
01:51:52,631 --> 01:51:58,785
"time-taking process, it's much more expensive than
what I was promised as part of this contract."

1733
01:51:58,785 --> 01:52:04,084
Looks back to Treev. Treev's leaning back and he's
like, "I just brought you here to talk with them."

1734
01:52:04,084 --> 01:52:13,115
TALIESIN: We just want to know our options, sir, and time is
sadly of the essence. What can you tell us about this?

1735
01:52:13,115 --> 01:52:19,275
MATT: "Strange construction."

1736
01:52:19,275 --> 01:52:21,544
TALIESIN: Yes.

1737
01:52:21,544 --> 01:52:33,404
MATT: "Ah. I see what you're talking about." He
starts glancing-- shut up!-- Glancing at the

1738
01:52:33,404 --> 01:52:47,176
bottom of Retort. "It is a variation on a scrying
enchantment, with a hint of a message-type base.

1739
01:52:47,176 --> 01:52:50,074
"It's audio only, not visual."

1740
01:52:50,074 --> 01:52:52,065
MARISHA: Son of a bitch!

1741
01:52:52,065 --> 01:52:54,727
TALIESIN: Can they track where we are?

1742
01:52:54,727 --> 01:53:04,139
MATT: "They cannot track location, but this is a
joint enchantment, there are two pieces to this.

1743
01:53:04,139 --> 01:53:11,892
"And it would appear that, wherever the receiving
end is, they can probably hear everything around it."

1744
01:53:11,892 --> 01:53:16,674
MARISHA: Guys, this could be a gift, think of the
possibilities.

1745
01:53:16,674 --> 01:53:18,284
TRAVIS: She's hearing this right now.

1746
01:53:18,284 --> 01:53:19,442
SAM: If she's listening.

1747
01:53:19,442 --> 01:53:23,454
MATT: "Oh, I'm sure whoever has the other side of
this enchantment is now well aware of everything

1748
01:53:23,454 --> 01:53:24,910
"we've just discussed."

1749
01:53:24,910 --> 01:53:26,044
LAURA: Great.

1750
01:53:26,044 --> 01:53:27,392
SAM: Maybe we should take it out of the room.

1751
01:53:27,392 --> 01:53:28,725
TALIESIN: Shh, no.

1752
01:53:28,725 --> 01:53:32,995
MATT: "Who has the other side of this enchantment
by the way?" And he suddenly looks extremely

1753
01:53:32,995 --> 01:53:35,877
nervous. Beads of sweat start showing up on his
forehead.

1754
01:53:35,877 --> 01:53:42,980
TALIESIN: I'll tell you what. You do the work
quickly, you do the work well, and you follow a

1755
01:53:42,980 --> 01:53:47,550
few other instructions of ours, and I will not say
her name out loud right now. How does that sound

1756
01:53:47,550 --> 01:53:48,751
to you?

1757
01:53:48,751 --> 01:53:52,728
MATT: What do you want? Disenchantment,
transference, tell me.

1758
01:53:52,728 --> 01:54:01,179
TALIESIN: Not anymore, we just want the
enchantment destroyed. And I will not say her

1759
01:54:01,179 --> 01:54:05,576
name, so that she will know that you do not know
who she is.

1760
01:54:05,576 --> 01:54:09,107
MATT: What does that mean? What does that mean?
What's he saying? What is he saying?

1761
01:54:09,107 --> 01:54:10,660
SAM: For your own protection.

1762
01:54:10,660 --> 01:54:19,236
TALIESIN: This is me, giving you a deal, good sir.
This is me, showing you respect. And you, if you

1763
01:54:19,236 --> 01:54:27,346
can hear me, and I get the sneaking suspicion you
can, I'm not ignoring you anymore.

1764
01:54:27,346 --> 01:54:40,042
SAM: Wait, before you do, a quick word, is there a
way to reverse the direction? Okay.

1765
01:54:40,042 --> 01:54:50,374
MATT: Reaches into a little pouch of components on
the side. Takes things, crushes them, sprinkles

1766
01:54:50,374 --> 01:54:57,728
them on. Looks about. "Ahem, it's done, it's gone,
here."

1767
01:54:57,728 --> 01:55:00,289
LAURA: What?! Really?

1768
01:55:00,289 --> 01:55:02,047
MARISHA: Can I check it?

1769
01:55:02,047 --> 01:55:02,941
MATT: Yeah.

1770
01:55:02,941 --> 01:55:04,246
MARISHA: Scanlan, help me check this.

1771
01:55:04,246 --> 01:55:05,247
LAURA: That fast?

1772
01:55:05,247 --> 01:55:06,147
SAM: All right.

1773
01:55:06,147 --> 01:55:07,669
LAURA: You are very powerful, you.

1774
01:55:07,669 --> 01:55:10,243
MARISHA: What do we do here?

1775
01:55:10,243 --> 01:55:11,715
MATT: Make an arcana check.

1776
01:55:11,715 --> 01:55:12,702
MARISHA: Scanlan, help.

1777
01:55:12,702 --> 01:55:15,709
SAM: Yeah, I got a natural one, sister.

1778
01:55:15,709 --> 01:55:17,632
MARISHA: Oh boy. 16.

1779
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:25,050
MATT: As you're staring at it, you watch as the
Ripley signature that's very, very small, put in

1780
01:55:25,050 --> 01:55:30,807
the bottom of the piece of whitestone, begins to
glow. Suddenly, he goes, "By the way, it takes a

1781
01:55:30,807 --> 01:55:38,919
"moment. Put your face away please!" And as you
pull it back, it flashes, and then goes dark

1782
01:55:38,919 --> 01:55:42,670
again. "And... now it's done."

1783
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:45,990
MARISHA: Okay, I'll look at it again. What does it
look like?

1784
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:47,346
MATT: Looks the same.

1785
01:55:47,346 --> 01:55:48,750
MARISHA: What do you mean it looks the same?

1786
01:55:48,750 --> 01:55:53,182
MATT: Meaning like, the signature's still there,
the stone is still there, but that slight essence

1787
01:55:53,182 --> 01:55:55,979
of slight enchantment that was there before is
gone.

1788
01:55:55,979 --> 01:56:01,442
TALIESIN: You wouldn't happen to know where to get
some construction materials on very quick notice?

1789
01:56:01,442 --> 01:56:04,760
MATT: "No!"

1790
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:06,847
LAURA: You wouldn't be able to identify something
for me, would you?

1791
01:56:06,847 --> 01:56:08,584
TALIESIN: Oh yes, go ahead, do that.

1792
01:56:08,584 --> 01:56:11,104
LAURA: You seem so smart, is all.

1793
01:56:11,104 --> 01:56:14,376
MATT: "This was not part of the agreement."

1794
01:56:14,376 --> 01:56:17,133
LAURA: Darling, we're already here, please?

1795
01:56:17,133 --> 01:56:18,702
TALIESIN: And we didn't say your name.

1796
01:56:18,702 --> 01:56:20,022
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1797
01:56:20,022 --> 01:56:21,505
MARISHA: "And we didn't say your name."

1798
01:56:21,505 --> 01:56:26,157
LAURA: Oh, damn it. I will pay you.

1799
01:56:26,157 --> 01:56:29,630
MATT: "How much?"

1800
01:56:29,630 --> 01:56:31,928
LAURA: How much do you want?

1801
01:56:31,928 --> 01:56:36,661
MATT: Looks back at Treev. Treev goes--

1802
01:56:36,661 --> 01:56:38,583
LAURA: Just to identify something, that's all
dear.

1803
01:56:38,583 --> 01:56:39,758
TALIESIN: Something simple.

1804
01:56:39,758 --> 01:56:42,504
MATT: "100 gold, please."

1805
01:56:42,504 --> 01:56:52,731
LAURA: 100 gold. Darling. It seemed effortless for
you to do that before. Is it hard?

1806
01:56:52,731 --> 01:56:54,679
MATT: "I have a shop to get back to. I'm sorry, I
can't be here any longer."

1807
01:56:54,679 --> 01:56:55,747
LAURA: Fine, fine.

1808
01:56:55,747 --> 01:56:56,860
MATT: And he gets up from the stool.

1809
01:56:56,860 --> 01:57:01,646
LAURA: Shit! Fine. A hundred gold, whatever. I
just want to know, can you look at this please?

1810
01:57:01,646 --> 01:57:08,255
It's a tea set, it's gold. Isn't it beautiful?

1811
01:57:08,255 --> 01:57:13,972
MATT: Takes it from you and his hands are clammy,
as he pulls it out of your grasp. And he looks

1812
01:57:13,972 --> 01:57:18,417
over the tea set, and it's in his hands, he
doesn't really know what to do with it. And he

1813
01:57:18,417 --> 01:57:29,680
places it on the side. "Okay." Begins breathing
heavily, and it's fogging the side of the metallic

1814
01:57:29,680 --> 01:57:34,079
tea set. And you see this sweat dripping off of
his nose. He's still very nervous about this

1815
01:57:34,079 --> 01:57:42,573
endeavor and wants to get out of here as soon as
possible. "All right, this is a tea set of

1816
01:57:42,573 --> 01:57:50,501
"envenoming. Whenever you produce some sort of a
liquid imbibement within the tea set, it's

1817
01:57:50,501 --> 01:57:54,041
"guaranteed to be a bad day for whoever drinks from
it."

1818
01:57:54,041 --> 01:57:56,111
LAURA: It's so good we didn't drink from it.

1819
01:57:56,111 --> 01:57:59,929
TALIESIN: Does the liquid hold its potency or is
it just within the tea set?

1820
01:57:59,929 --> 01:58:01,069
MATT: "For a day."

1821
01:58:01,069 --> 01:58:02,109
TALIESIN: Good to know.

1822
01:58:02,109 --> 01:58:02,939
LAURA: Lovely.

1823
01:58:02,939 --> 01:58:03,696
TALIESIN: Excellent.

1824
01:58:03,696 --> 01:58:04,845
SAM: Will someone die?

1825
01:58:04,845 --> 01:58:09,107
MATT: "I'm not a master of poisons, I just know
that it poisons."

1826
01:58:09,107 --> 01:58:10,571
LAURA: Thank you so much.

1827
01:58:10,571 --> 01:58:14,656
MATT: And he takes it and holds it, and is like,
"100 gold."

1828
01:58:14,656 --> 01:58:16,101
LAURA: Of course dear.

1829
01:58:16,101 --> 01:58:21,376
MATT: "Thank you." And as soon as he gets it, he
lets go of it, puts it in his pouch. "And good

1830
01:58:21,376 --> 01:58:29,783
"day. Treev, careful next time." And he darts off,
outside. Bursting through the door and into the

1831
01:58:29,783 --> 01:58:32,312
alley. And Treev sits.

1832
01:58:32,312 --> 01:58:37,617
TALIESIN: I was imagining the FBI agent from The
Frighteners, I was having a lot of that.

1833
01:58:37,617 --> 01:58:42,251
MARISHA: I was imagining The Creep music video from
Lonely Island.

1834
01:58:42,251 --> 01:58:54,058
MATT: Kind of. Yeah, actually. Treev is like, "Now
that was fun to watch."

1835
01:58:54,058 --> 01:58:55,278
LAURA: That guy was weird.

1836
01:58:55,278 --> 01:59:00,616
MATT: "He's a weird one. I knew he'd do the job,
but honestly I like watching him twitch."

1837
01:59:00,616 --> 01:59:08,839
TALIESIN: Thank you, that was very helpful. That
was very helpful. They don't know that we're

1838
01:59:08,839 --> 01:59:13,329
coming as they don't know how we're going or why,
because we have spoken all of that outside of the

1839
01:59:13,329 --> 01:59:15,920
range of that device. They don't know any of
that.

1840
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:17,413
MARISHA: True, the gun was in the other room.

1841
01:59:17,413 --> 01:59:21,863
TALIESIN: All they know is that we found the
enchantment and killed it.

1842
01:59:21,863 --> 01:59:23,257
LIAM: Should we melt it just in case?

1843
01:59:23,257 --> 01:59:37,041
TALIESIN: No. There will be no more melting of my
property for a little while yet. I have a bit of a

1844
01:59:37,041 --> 01:59:44,110
quick shopping list before we head out of town. I
was wondering if it would be possible to gather

1845
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:48,821
some quick supplies, if some of your people knew
where to get simple construction materials,

1846
01:59:48,821 --> 01:59:50,369
quickly. Today.

1847
01:59:50,369 --> 01:59:52,241
LAURA: And potions of healing.

1848
01:59:52,241 --> 01:59:58,658
MATT: "Potions, head to the Suncut Bazaar. I'm
sure you could find a few folks. We usually get ours

1849
01:59:58,658 --> 02:00:02,665
"from--" And he starts looking through a list, he
goes, "Let's see, there's--"

1850
02:00:02,665 --> 02:00:05,163
LIAM: Are we staying here for the night before
heading out in the morning?

1851
02:00:05,163 --> 02:00:06,103
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: No.

1852
02:00:06,103 --> 02:00:07,153
LIAM: So we're sleeping on the ship?

1853
02:00:07,153 --> 02:00:08,190
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yes.

1854
02:00:08,190 --> 02:00:10,649
MATT: "Nisaba are the two I know of, at least."

1855
02:00:10,649 --> 02:00:11,846
LAURA: Saaba and what?

1856
02:00:11,846 --> 02:00:14,290
MATT: "Usar and Nisaba."

1857
02:00:14,290 --> 02:00:18,853
LAURA: They'll give a good deal?

1858
02:00:18,853 --> 02:00:22,115
MATT: "Perhaps. You ask them nicely."

1859
02:00:22,115 --> 02:00:31,632
TALIESIN: I need lumber, steel, lead, and a couple
other things. Very simple. Just some materials.

1860
02:00:31,632 --> 02:00:35,460
I'll show you what I'm building and I'll have you
figure out the number.

1861
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:38,888
MATT: "Right."

1862
02:00:38,888 --> 02:00:43,185
TALIESIN: Loaded straight on the ship.

1863
02:00:43,185 --> 02:00:49,795
MATT: "What you're looking for is the Bone Garden.
It's the northernmost side of the Suncut Bazaar.

1864
02:00:49,795 --> 02:00:59,043
"They deal with a lot of the not guild-run sales
of various construction means. More for the

1865
02:00:59,043 --> 02:01:01,188
"residential folk here in Ank'Harel."

1866
02:01:01,188 --> 02:01:02,584
TALIESIN: That'll do.

1867
02:01:02,584 --> 02:01:08,842
MATT: For the sake of brevity, what are you
searching for?

1868
02:01:08,842 --> 02:01:19,847
TALIESIN: I'm trying to get enough construction
material to build a very basic 125-pound mountable

1869
02:01:19,847 --> 02:01:25,736
cannon that I can move around the ship on wheels,
and a little bit of shot for a cannon, about five

1870
02:01:25,736 --> 02:01:30,685
pound shot. It's simple, but it's going to be a
son of a bitch.

1871
02:01:30,685 --> 02:01:35,508
MATT: There are cannons made. That technology--

1872
02:01:35,508 --> 02:01:41,241
TALIESIN: --does exist. But does something that
small that can move around a ship exist? This

1873
02:01:41,241 --> 02:01:46,688
would be something that four people could pick up
and move around.

1874
02:01:46,688 --> 02:01:59,876
MATT: That small? The few things they have here,
they're magically-based fire. It's similar to the

1875
02:01:59,876 --> 02:02:09,956
dragon arbalist installation. It's not so much a
gunpowder-based explosion, since that is mostly

1876
02:02:09,956 --> 02:02:17,977
unutilized. This is a metal tube that contains an
enchantment that throws out bursts of energy. You

1877
02:02:17,977 --> 02:02:21,440
could purchase a base for one of those
constructs. That would cut down the time

1878
02:02:21,479 --> 02:02:26,557
because if you're going to make a cannon, that's
going to be an endeavor, that'll take you a long time.

1879
02:02:26,557 --> 02:02:32,739
TALIESIN: A base will do, and I need to build a
thing to build cannonballs.

1880
02:02:32,739 --> 02:02:40,697
MATT: Takes you the better part of the day to even
find out, asking around because Treev doesn't know

1881
02:02:40,697 --> 02:02:45,742
anything about where to find the base for a cannon
like that. Takes you the better part of the rest

1882
02:02:45,742 --> 02:02:49,873
of the day, pushing into dusk, for you to find out where
that could be purchased. That's going to run you

1883
02:02:49,908 --> 02:02:52,486
about 60 gold.

1884
02:02:52,486 --> 02:02:54,724
TALIESIN: I'm good with that.

1885
02:02:54,724 --> 02:02:56,222
MATT: It's not enchanted.

1886
02:02:56,222 --> 02:03:04,701
TALIESIN: 60 gold and then a little extra to make
cannonballs and otherwise. Get them to deliver it

1887
02:03:04,701 --> 02:03:08,201
to the ship and I'm sending everything to be
delivered immediately to the ship.

1888
02:03:08,201 --> 02:03:12,236
MATT: Anything else anyone wants to prepare?

1889
02:03:12,236 --> 02:03:14,866
LAURA: Potions. I need healing potions. Who needs
healing potions?

1890
02:03:14,866 --> 02:03:15,790
SAM: All of us.

1891
02:03:15,790 --> 02:03:16,763
TALIESIN: Everybody.

1892
02:03:16,763 --> 02:03:17,877
MARISHA: Sure.

1893
02:03:17,877 --> 02:03:23,382
MATT: On street-level sales, asking around, the
most you can acquire are probably any number of

1894
02:03:23,382 --> 02:03:33,571
common, regular healing potions you may want.
Through conversations, at most five of the greater

1895
02:03:33,571 --> 02:03:35,193
can be purchased.

1896
02:03:35,193 --> 02:03:37,609
LAURA: Okay. Scanlan, can you come with me?

1897
02:03:37,609 --> 02:03:38,912
SAM: Yes.

1898
02:03:38,912 --> 02:03:41,594
LAURA: Can we find a Hand of Ord?

1899
02:03:41,594 --> 02:03:46,799
MATT: Yeah, not too hard to find at all. Quick
look around, a Hand of Ord, especially here in the

1900
02:03:46,799 --> 02:03:47,827
market.

1901
02:03:47,827 --> 02:03:49,762
SAM: Flash the thing? What am I flashing it for?

1902
02:03:49,762 --> 02:03:51,168
LAURA: I want to talk to him.

1903
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:52,537
LIAM: Get the cube out.

1904
02:03:52,537 --> 02:03:59,616
SAM: Oi, mate. We're friends with J'mon Sa Ord.

1905
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:05,398
LAURA: We're not making a street deal right now.

1906
02:04:05,398 --> 02:04:07,743
SAM: Oh! I thought everything was here.

1907
02:04:07,743 --> 02:04:11,953
TALIESIN: This could be part of your problem here.

1908
02:04:11,953 --> 02:04:14,758
MATT: He bends down after giving you a weird
eyebrow.

1909
02:04:14,758 --> 02:04:16,961
SAM: I'm a normal, human man.

1910
02:04:16,961 --> 02:04:19,692
MATT: You're still in your--

1911
02:04:19,692 --> 02:04:21,332
SAM: I forgot to take it off.

1912
02:04:21,332 --> 02:04:30,929
MATT: So you're a normal, human man in non-Ank'Harel
attire. Shows off the necklace. He looks at it.

1913
02:04:30,929 --> 02:04:34,842
"How did you come about that?"

1914
02:04:34,842 --> 02:04:40,523
LAURA: We met with J'mon Sa Ord earlier. We have
their blessing.

1915
02:04:40,523 --> 02:04:43,294
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1916
02:04:43,294 --> 02:04:47,908
LAURA: 18.

1917
02:04:47,908 --> 02:04:49,470
MATT: 18 total?

1918
02:04:49,470 --> 02:04:50,418
LAURA: Yeah.

1919
02:04:50,418 --> 02:04:54,326
MATT: He goes, "Okay, what can I be of service to
you?"

1920
02:04:54,326 --> 02:05:00,200
LAURA: We're in need of some healing potions. I'm
assuming, as a guard of the city, you have access

1921
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:01,809
to quite a few?

1922
02:05:01,809 --> 02:05:06,432
MATT: "Could probably muster a few from the
barracks, yes."

1923
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:10,382
LAURA: Some greater healing potions would be
wonderful.

1924
02:05:10,382 --> 02:05:16,954
MATT: "I'll get what we can spare. We still have to
keep enough to maintain our watch."

1925
02:05:16,954 --> 02:05:18,876
LAURA: Of course.

1926
02:05:18,876 --> 02:05:21,776
MATT: "Wait here. Give me a half-hour."

1927
02:05:21,776 --> 02:05:23,629
SAM: Okay.

1928
02:05:23,629 --> 02:05:28,627
MATT: You guys wait for him and he comes back with
six regular healing potions and three greater.

1929
02:05:28,627 --> 02:05:34,960
SAM: This thing is the best thing ever! I'm not
holding anything but it's still cool!

1930
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:37,245
(laughter)

1931
02:05:37,245 --> 02:05:39,398
LAURA: Six regular?

1932
02:05:39,398 --> 02:05:42,264
TRAVIS: And three greater.

1933
02:05:42,264 --> 02:05:47,002
MATT: "This is what we can spare from the nearby
barracks."

1934
02:05:47,002 --> 02:05:50,205
LAURA: Thank you so much. Your aid is
appreciated.

1935
02:05:50,205 --> 02:05:54,308
MATT: "If I could have your names, just to be safe
that everything is--"

1936
02:05:54,308 --> 02:05:56,975
LAURA: Be pleased. Vox Machina.

1937
02:05:56,975 --> 02:05:59,127
MATT: "Vox Machina."

1938
02:05:59,127 --> 02:06:06,640
LAURA: And then I want to buy like three more
greaters.

1939
02:06:06,640 --> 02:06:08,394
MATT: All right. That is 1500 gold.

1940
02:06:08,394 --> 02:06:10,566
LAURA: Can I say I haggled?

1941
02:06:10,566 --> 02:06:12,798
MATT: Roll a persuasion check.

1942
02:06:12,798 --> 02:06:18,275
(assorted muttering)

1943
02:06:18,275 --> 02:06:19,637
LAURA: Shut up!

1944
02:06:19,637 --> 02:06:20,666
MARISHA: Big money, no whammies.

1945
02:06:20,666 --> 02:06:21,769
LAURA: Natural 20!

1946
02:06:21,769 --> 02:06:22,998
ALL: Oh!

1947
02:06:22,998 --> 02:06:25,358
TRAVIS: The sorcery is strong with this one,
apparently.

1948
02:06:25,358 --> 02:06:31,779
MATT: Through diving between two different
locations that sell these potions and forcing them

1949
02:06:31,779 --> 02:06:37,583
to basically bid back and forth for your business,
you manage to work it down to 1100 gold pieces for

1950
02:06:37,583 --> 02:06:39,581
the three greater healing potions.

1951
02:06:39,581 --> 02:06:43,509
TALIESIN: It's like you've got Amazon.com on your
phone and you're going, "Eh? Eh?"

1952
02:06:43,509 --> 02:06:46,123
LAURA: All right, three more greater healing
potions.

1953
02:06:46,123 --> 02:06:47,046
MATT: Yes.

1954
02:06:47,046 --> 02:06:48,034
LAURA: Sounds good.

1955
02:06:48,034 --> 02:06:53,790
SAM: You saved 400 gold! Want to kick some of that
to this guy? Well, I've been helping you all day,

1956
02:06:53,790 --> 02:06:56,165
shuttling back and forth between those two.

1957
02:06:56,165 --> 02:06:57,833
LAURA: Can I insight check him?

1958
02:06:57,833 --> 02:06:59,020
MATT: Go for it.

1959
02:06:59,020 --> 02:07:01,745
TALIESIN: It's not going to work but oh, I hope it
does.

1960
02:07:01,745 --> 02:07:02,966
MATT: Make a deception check.

1961
02:07:02,966 --> 02:07:04,320
LIAM: Oh, it's high.

1962
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:06,130
TRAVIS: (chuckles) You're fucked.

1963
02:07:06,130 --> 02:07:07,372
SAM: It's not that good.

1964
02:07:07,372 --> 02:07:08,406
LAURA: 27.

1965
02:07:08,406 --> 02:07:10,782
MATT: Remember, you can also add your own
inspiration die if you want to.

1966
02:07:10,782 --> 02:07:15,321
SAM: No, no need. Let's see here. You said 27?

1967
02:07:15,321 --> 02:07:16,330
LAURA: Yeah.

1968
02:07:16,330 --> 02:07:17,377
SAM: 26.

1969
02:07:17,377 --> 02:07:18,776
(gasping)

1970
02:07:18,776 --> 02:07:26,223
MATT: For the first time, you see a crack in
Scanlan Shorthalt's veneer. You see a bit of sweat

1971
02:07:26,223 --> 02:07:33,176
at his brow and as he mentions this money,
suddenly you see this quiver to his smile. His

1972
02:07:33,176 --> 02:07:41,098
teeth shine not as bright as you recall. And there's a
taste of desperation you never knew was there at

1973
02:07:41,098 --> 02:07:42,289
the mention of money.

1974
02:07:42,289 --> 02:07:43,778
TRAVIS: The faintest nosebleed.

1975
02:07:43,778 --> 02:07:44,822
LAURA: Darling?

1976
02:07:44,822 --> 02:07:45,992
SAM: (strained) Yes?

1977
02:07:45,992 --> 02:07:48,843
LAURA: We all have off days.

1978
02:07:48,843 --> 02:07:51,926
SAM: (strained) I've had a whole off city!

1979
02:07:51,926 --> 02:07:54,399
LAURA: We're about to leave.

1980
02:07:54,399 --> 02:07:56,577
SAM: (strained) Please, can we?

1981
02:07:56,577 --> 02:07:59,254
LAURA: We can. I won't tell anyone.

1982
02:07:59,254 --> 02:08:02,299
SAM: All right. So, like, 200 gold then?

1983
02:08:02,299 --> 02:08:04,461
TRAVIS: Please, sir?

1984
02:08:04,461 --> 02:08:08,284
LAURA: I give him 50. That's for lying to me.

1985
02:08:08,284 --> 02:08:12,632
SAM: Thank you. I want to go away from this
place.

1986
02:08:12,632 --> 02:08:18,861
LIAM: Can we get back to politics, please?

1987
02:08:18,861 --> 02:08:23,377
LAURA: All right. Minus 1100.

1988
02:08:23,377 --> 02:08:31,077
MATT: I like to imagine when this whole campaign's
over, Scanlan Shorthalt comes back and cleans out

1989
02:08:31,077 --> 02:08:32,905
the casino in vengeance.

1990
02:08:32,905 --> 02:08:35,148
LIAM: As the airship bears down on Ank'Harel.

1991
02:08:35,148 --> 02:08:39,644
MATT: I meant monetarily, but that works too.

1992
02:08:39,644 --> 02:08:41,486
LIAM: Scarface.

1993
02:08:41,486 --> 02:08:44,404
TRAVIS: Even though it's dusk, should we mount up
tonight?

1994
02:08:44,404 --> 02:08:46,285
SAM: Yes.

1995
02:08:46,285 --> 02:08:48,101
LAURA: Yes, Let's go get on the boat.

1996
02:08:48,101 --> 02:08:49,812
TRAVIS: Let's head to the skies.

1997
02:08:49,812 --> 02:08:51,658
LIAM: This is really happening.

1998
02:08:51,658 --> 02:08:53,000
TALIESIN: I'm so excited.

1999
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:54,477
LIAM: We've joked about it for ages.

2000
02:08:54,477 --> 02:08:55,599
TRAVIS: (singing) Indalla!

2001
02:08:55,599 --> 02:09:01,631
MATT: All right, you all make your way to the sky
port.

2002
02:09:01,631 --> 02:09:02,807
TALIESIN: Yes.

2003
02:09:02,807 --> 02:09:06,115
SAM: Ah, it would've been so much sweeter if we
could've stolen the airship, but getting it for

2004
02:09:06,115 --> 02:09:07,349
free feels right.

2005
02:09:07,349 --> 02:09:09,132
TALIESIN: We got it for a steal.

2006
02:09:09,132 --> 02:09:16,018
MATT: All right, so you guys make your way up to
the terraced platform above the sky port. The

2007
02:09:16,018 --> 02:09:19,704
larger ship you guys saw earlier is no longer
there, it has taken off, and now all you see

2008
02:09:19,704 --> 02:09:25,774
before you is the ship Deera that is currently
down. The six chains have been reduced to two, and

2009
02:09:25,774 --> 02:09:31,995
it appears to be at the ready. As opposed to its
resting position, now the fan on the sides is

2010
02:09:31,995 --> 02:09:39,502
unfurled, the crystals themselves glow with a
faint blue energy signature, as the dusk sun

2011
02:09:39,502 --> 02:09:46,707
begins to set. It's much more prominent now. And a
series of four rope ladders have been dropped from the

2012
02:09:46,707 --> 02:09:50,029
side of the actual ship.

2013
02:09:50,029 --> 02:09:52,633
SAM: Ladies, your chariot awaits.

2014
02:09:52,633 --> 02:09:56,767
MARISHA: No. I make sure Scanlan goes first.

2015
02:09:56,767 --> 02:09:58,179
SAM: All right.

2016
02:09:58,179 --> 02:10:01,227
MATT: All right.

2017
02:10:01,227 --> 02:10:04,156
LAURA: I turn around and wink at him as I go up.

2018
02:10:04,156 --> 02:10:09,497
MATT: All right, you guys make your way up the
rope ladders. This is indeed the ship that you

2019
02:10:09,497 --> 02:10:15,667
made across, although it has a new paint job on
it. It looks a little bit nicer, but it also seems

2020
02:10:15,667 --> 02:10:21,992
to have seen some disuse. You make your way onto
the board and there you can see familiar ship

2021
02:10:21,992 --> 02:10:27,277
hands that go around, nodding to you out of
recognition. Some of them are pulling up the rope

2022
02:10:27,277 --> 02:10:32,235
ladders behind you. You see two on the bottom
there are now unchaining from the edge of where

2023
02:10:32,235 --> 02:10:36,494
it's latched onto the side of the ship, on each
side, that keeps it latched into the skyport. And

2024
02:10:36,494 --> 02:10:42,520
Captain Damon comes up to the top to greet you.
"Very well. I see that you've come to begin the

2025
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:48,738
"journey. Well, it is a pleasure to see you all
again, safe and sound, although you are missing

2026
02:10:48,738 --> 02:10:51,279
"one. Two, actually."

2027
02:10:51,279 --> 02:11:00,220
TALIESIN: Yes, we're a bit thinner. It has been
difficult and we have friends elsewhere preparing

2028
02:11:00,220 --> 02:11:05,189
for more difficult times. Are you aware of what's
going on across the sea?

2029
02:11:05,189 --> 02:11:11,662
MATT: "I'm very aware. That was the guild that
owned the ship and ran our business disappeared in

2030
02:11:11,662 --> 02:11:18,216
"the attack, and we've been set adrift, making our
own money and making ends meet in the meantime,

2031
02:11:18,216 --> 02:11:19,940
"doing odd jobs here and there."

2032
02:11:19,940 --> 02:11:25,139
TALIESIN: Well, if you're interested, we are
definitely moving towards correcting some of these

2033
02:11:25,139 --> 02:11:27,579
problems. Quickly.

2034
02:11:27,579 --> 02:11:34,946
MATT: "If you do, tell the guild that the ship
crashed, because as of right now it's technically

2035
02:11:34,946 --> 02:11:36,376
"my ship."

2036
02:11:36,376 --> 02:11:38,136
TALIESIN: Is this an insurance thing?

2037
02:11:38,136 --> 02:11:42,285
MATT: "I didn't-- the guild owned and ran the
shipping business, but I mean--"

2038
02:11:42,285 --> 02:11:48,118
TALIESIN: Oh no. Yes, I'm a deep believer in
insurance fraud. Of course.

2039
02:11:48,118 --> 02:11:51,015
MATT: "It's not--" (sighs)

2040
02:11:51,015 --> 02:11:53,487
LIAM: We're friends here. You're good.

2041
02:11:53,487 --> 02:11:59,817
MATT: "I'd like to know where we're going. As that
is part of the deal to be kept secret until boarding."

2042
02:11:59,817 --> 02:12:04,432
TRAVIS: Actually, if you don't mind, we're heading
north. Once we're away from port, we plan to

2043
02:12:04,432 --> 02:12:06,594
inform you of our destination.

2044
02:12:06,594 --> 02:12:07,553
TALIESIN: Tomorrow.

2045
02:12:07,553 --> 02:12:11,455
MATT: "North it is. Very well." And he pulls a
whistle from around his neck and blows it really

2046
02:12:11,455 --> 02:12:16,576
loudly and everyone unleashes the chains from the
side. (clanking sound) They crash down, slamming

2047
02:12:16,576 --> 02:12:22,250
onto the terrace deck below. The ship lurches and
lifts up a few feet naturally and finding its own

2048
02:12:22,250 --> 02:12:27,193
balance, based on the enchantment of the crystals.
"You can stay on the edge if you'd like. You're

2049
02:12:27,193 --> 02:12:36,730
"welcome to find your quarters down below. But we
are about to make sail." He walks to the edge of

2050
02:12:36,730 --> 02:12:42,248
the ship, the middle of the ship, the back where
you can see he directs the position of it, and

2051
02:12:42,248 --> 02:12:49,520
controls the crystals themselves. And the giant
dragon-headed arbalist you see installed at the

2052
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:57,601
side. They're like the giant heavy crossbows that
are bolted onto the side, these large spears-- the

2053
02:12:57,601 --> 02:13:01,120
ones you were using in the fight before, they're
nearly twice the size of what they were, and the

2054
02:13:01,120 --> 02:13:07,859
front of them have this giant dark metal dragon
head that is built around it. It's been definitely

2055
02:13:07,859 --> 02:13:15,449
fitted to be a much more badass airship than you
remember. It lifts up, and as the last bit of the

2056
02:13:15,449 --> 02:13:22,025
sun disappears below the distant horizon and the
city of Ank'Harel's lighting up for the evening

2057
02:13:22,025 --> 02:13:28,952
time, you take up into the sky, slowly turning
northward towards what you can see as barely

2058
02:13:28,952 --> 02:13:37,311
visible, the silhouetted edge of the mountain range
before you, the Agrad Mountains, making your way

2059
02:13:37,311 --> 02:13:41,064
to the rest of your journey. And we're going to go
ahead and take a break; we'll come back here in

2060
02:13:41,064 --> 02:13:42,199
just a minute.

2061
02:13:42,199 --> 02:13:47,077
TRAVIS: One thing before we do: we forgot to
mention that next week during Game the Game,

2062
02:13:47,077 --> 02:13:53,836
thanks to Magic Puzzle Quest, Matt and Marisha,
Taliesin, Liam, and myself will be joining Ivan

2063
02:13:53,836 --> 02:13:57,942
and Becca for Game the Game, from 5:30 to 6:30, so
make sure you tune in. It's going to be a very

2064
02:13:57,942 --> 02:14:00,070
special Game the Game. Thank you, Magic Puzzle
Quest.

2065
02:14:00,070 --> 02:14:01,725
LAURA: Also thank you Backblaze!

2066
02:14:01,725 --> 02:14:06,995
MATT: All right guys, we'll see you in a few
minutes. Thank you, Travis.

2067
02:14:06,995 --> 02:27:05,154
[break]

2068
02:27:05,154 --> 02:27:11,023
MATT: Hello, and welcome back to Critical Role. So
as we left off, Vox Machina is--

2069
02:27:11,023 --> 02:27:17,525
LAURA: Wait, before we do that! We forgot to
mention at the top of the show. There's only one

2070
02:27:17,525 --> 02:27:20,720
week of preorder left on the bracelets and the
pins.

2071
02:27:20,720 --> 02:27:22,627
TRAVIS: Yeah, we wouldn't want people to miss out.
It's limited run.

2072
02:27:22,627 --> 02:27:25,050
TALIESIN: I don't have a bracelet, but I have the
pins.

2073
02:27:25,050 --> 02:27:26,311
LAURA: He's wearing the bracelet.

2074
02:27:26,311 --> 02:27:30,146
SAM: Laura, I did mention that while you were
getting whispered to.

2075
02:27:30,146 --> 02:27:36,829
LAURA: I know, you did. I heard you, but, you
know. In case people were drowning you out. And

2076
02:27:36,829 --> 02:27:41,517
then we also have the limited items, which we only
have a little bit left in the store: the nail

2077
02:27:41,517 --> 02:27:49,822
wraps, and the patches that were limited edition
at Comic-Con that are still there. I

2078
02:27:49,822 --> 02:27:51,996
think, still in the store? So yeah.

2079
02:27:51,996 --> 02:27:53,562
TALIESIN: Were the rings up in there?

2080
02:27:53,562 --> 02:27:55,498
LAURA: The rings! And the rings, the spinning
rings.

2081
02:27:55,498 --> 02:27:56,936
TALIESIN: Did they come back in?

2082
02:27:56,936 --> 02:27:59,144
TRAVIS: And the mug, which is my favorite. Okay,
now we're good.

2083
02:27:59,144 --> 02:28:00,280
LAURA: Okay, sorry.

2084
02:28:00,280 --> 02:28:06,849
MATT: All right, no worries. Thank you for
mentioning that. Vox Machina, as night has taken

2085
02:28:06,849 --> 02:28:14,176
the sky and you lift up, heading northward, you
watch as the glowing jewel of Ank'Harel begins to

2086
02:28:14,176 --> 02:28:21,007
slowly grow smaller and smaller in the distance.
Below you, you see a mass of black darkness.

2087
02:28:21,007 --> 02:28:23,954
MARISHA: I want to take Percy to the front of the
ship.

2088
02:28:23,954 --> 02:28:24,949
TALIESIN: Ah! That's my--

2089
02:28:24,949 --> 02:28:26,135
MARISHA: Set it down.

2090
02:28:26,135 --> 02:28:27,320
TALIESIN: I'll put it down, okay.

2091
02:28:27,320 --> 02:28:30,727
MARISHA: And I want to--

2092
02:28:30,727 --> 02:28:32,404
TALIESIN: (whispers) I feel so dirty.

2093
02:28:32,404 --> 02:28:33,799
MARISHA: (whispers) Say you can fly.

2094
02:28:33,799 --> 02:28:34,627
TALIESIN: No.

2095
02:28:34,627 --> 02:28:35,524
MARISHA: Say you can fly.

2096
02:28:35,524 --> 02:28:38,613
TALIESIN: No, because I'm not going to say that--
It's not true. It's not true.

2097
02:28:38,613 --> 02:28:39,640
MARISHA: Say you're flying.

2098
02:28:39,640 --> 02:28:40,835
TALIESIN: I feel sick.

2099
02:28:40,835 --> 02:28:43,064
MARISHA: (laughs) Damn it.

2100
02:28:43,064 --> 02:28:44,652
LAURA: Don't throw up again.

2101
02:28:44,652 --> 02:28:48,756
LIAM: While they're doing that, I'm actually
flying next to the ship and praying for a while

2102
02:28:48,756 --> 02:28:50,604
out in the dark.

2103
02:28:50,604 --> 02:29:01,952
MATT: Okay. So yeah. You have very little idea of
where you are other than watching the city slowly

2104
02:29:01,952 --> 02:29:06,441
disappear. Above, as you look towards the front
of the ship, where it's going, you can see little

2105
02:29:06,441 --> 02:29:12,235
specks of light in the distance, almost like
smaller cities or villages that slowly begin to

2106
02:29:12,235 --> 02:29:18,365
move past and below you. And the stars in the sky
breaking through some of the clouds that

2107
02:29:18,365 --> 02:29:24,861
occasionally block as you progress. As the ship
begins to rise about cloud level, you can see the

2108
02:29:24,861 --> 02:29:30,349
very faint outline of the mountain range, and you
then coast above it. As you begin to finally crest

2109
02:29:30,349 --> 02:29:37,948
over the top of the mountain range itself, Captain
Damon locks the ship steering mechanism in place

2110
02:29:37,948 --> 02:29:45,934
and walks back to address all of you, and goes,
"All right, we're well on our way. We're heading

2111
02:29:45,934 --> 02:29:50,484
"north. We've been travelling for a number of hours
now. Where are we going?"

2112
02:29:50,484 --> 02:29:52,686
TALIESIN: Before--

2113
02:29:52,686 --> 02:29:55,710
MATT: (sighs)

2114
02:29:55,710 --> 02:30:00,018
TALIESIN: I swear this is important. Before we say
anything, we would like to take a moment to meet

2115
02:30:00,018 --> 02:30:01,638
the rest of the crew.

2116
02:30:01,638 --> 02:30:03,822
TRAVIS: Yes, and all hands on deck.

2117
02:30:03,822 --> 02:30:08,023
TALIESIN: To make sure that nobody suspicious has
snuck on board and nobody is hiding their

2118
02:30:08,023 --> 02:30:09,197
identity.

2119
02:30:09,197 --> 02:30:20,916
MATT: "Very well." He gathers the rest of the
crew. You recognize a few of them. They have a few

2120
02:30:20,916 --> 02:30:29,381
new faces, because they lost a few on the last
journey. You individually meet each one with

2121
02:30:29,381 --> 02:30:35,962
pretty heavy inspection from you guys. I want you
to make insight checks, all of you, as you're

2122
02:30:35,962 --> 02:30:37,857
inspecting this crew.

2123
02:30:37,857 --> 02:30:41,319
TALIESIN: No!

2124
02:30:41,319 --> 02:30:43,791
SAM: 15.

2125
02:30:43,791 --> 02:30:45,239
TRAVIS: 19.

2126
02:30:45,239 --> 02:30:46,843
LAURA: 22.

2127
02:30:46,843 --> 02:30:47,969
LIAM: 15.

2128
02:30:47,969 --> 02:31:01,497
MATT: All right. Glancing about, mostly human
crew. There is one elf, a female, who's part of

2129
02:31:01,497 --> 02:31:09,117
the crew, who handles most direct navigation with
the captain now, and you hadn't met before. Her

2130
02:31:09,117 --> 02:31:19,385
name is Julia, and she seems nice enough. There is
a female halfling who has very nice, clean-cut

2131
02:31:19,385 --> 02:31:26,826
hair, pulled into a heavy ponytail in the back.
And as she smiles, you can see her somewhat broken

2132
02:31:26,826 --> 02:31:39,788
and rotted teeth. As you guys give the whole
look-over, she smiles and looks a little nervous

2133
02:31:39,788 --> 02:31:48,668
at the rest of you. You take a closer look and you
pick up on it, Vex. This is one of the bandits,

2134
02:31:48,668 --> 02:31:51,311
the one you took captive on the journey over to
Vasselheim.

2135
02:31:51,311 --> 02:31:52,926
LAURA: The one that I harpooned!

2136
02:31:52,926 --> 02:31:55,591
MATT: Yes. She apparently has become one of the
crew now.

2137
02:31:55,591 --> 02:31:58,896
LAURA: Wow. Well, we vouched for her at the time.

2138
02:31:58,896 --> 02:32:01,075
MARISHA: We wanted her, right? Are we cool?

2139
02:32:01,075 --> 02:32:04,723
TRAVIS: She dies.

2140
02:32:04,723 --> 02:32:10,173
TALIESIN: Good for you. Excellent.

2141
02:32:10,173 --> 02:32:12,959
MARISHA: What's her name? Did we ever get a name
from her?

2142
02:32:12,959 --> 02:32:14,105
MATT: Teela.

2143
02:32:14,105 --> 02:32:15,896
ALL: Teela.

2144
02:32:15,896 --> 02:32:20,535
MATT: Teera, sorry. R. Teera. I had it written
down. I should look at my sheet first.

2145
02:32:20,535 --> 02:32:30,798
TALIESIN: And there's no magic attempts to hide
somebody's face or anything like that?

2146
02:32:30,798 --> 02:32:36,789
MATT: No. You guys all give a good look and a very
thorough inspection of the crew, and they all seem

2147
02:32:36,789 --> 02:32:37,902
legitimate.

2148
02:32:37,902 --> 02:32:39,015
TALIESIN: And this is everybody?

2149
02:32:39,015 --> 02:32:39,868
MATT: Yes.

2150
02:32:39,868 --> 02:32:40,639
TRAVIS: Captain.

2151
02:32:40,639 --> 02:32:41,590
MATT: "Yes?"

2152
02:32:41,590 --> 02:32:46,777
TRAVIS: Who is it that's in charge of your
seaworthy navigations? The newest member of your

2153
02:32:46,777 --> 02:32:48,190
crew you mentioned?

2154
02:32:48,190 --> 02:32:54,722
MATT: "Well, that would be Teera. She's actually
been all about this ocean. Not necessarily by

2155
02:32:54,722 --> 02:32:58,922
"skyship, but she knows the area as well, and has
since studied up and has become a very esteemed

2156
02:32:58,922 --> 02:33:06,556
"member of our crew." He looks to her, and Teera's
smile broadens again. "That is correct. I'm happy

2157
02:33:06,556 --> 02:33:11,324
"to help in wherever it is you're looking to go.
Where are you going?"

2158
02:33:11,324 --> 02:33:21,154
SAM: Shall we lay it on them, then? We're going to
go near the island of glass, aka Glintshore.

2159
02:33:21,154 --> 02:33:32,605
MATT: You watch her face go, and Captain Damon
goes, "Why Glintshore? That place is a rocky waste."

2160
02:33:32,605 --> 02:33:37,237
SAM: Well, we're not going there. We're going near
it to find a shipwreck.

2161
02:33:37,237 --> 02:33:45,217
MATT: "Shipwreck? There's probably hundreds of
them! The place is dotted with reefs."

2162
02:33:45,217 --> 02:33:49,228
TALIESIN: We're looking for a ship called The
Shrew.

2163
02:33:49,228 --> 02:33:52,655
MATT: "So you're wanting us to take you to the
Hespet Archipelago."

2164
02:33:52,655 --> 02:33:55,457
MARISHA: Yeah.

2165
02:33:55,457 --> 02:33:58,506
TALIESIN: There is another ship on the way there,
as well.

2166
02:33:58,506 --> 02:34:00,651
TRAVIS: Some say arch-ipelago, but yeah.

2167
02:34:00,651 --> 02:34:02,448
TALIESIN: There may be trouble.

2168
02:34:02,448 --> 02:34:07,482
SAM: The other ship may already be there, and if
we can find the other ship, then we've found our

2169
02:34:07,482 --> 02:34:08,754
destination.

2170
02:34:08,754 --> 02:34:25,199
MATT: "Right. The arch-ipelago. Let's see. We have
no sundry we're holding, so we're at maximum

2171
02:34:25,199 --> 02:34:30,851
"speed. I'd say two, maybe three days of travel,
depending on weather."

2172
02:34:30,851 --> 02:34:36,225
SAM: Just to get in the area. It'll take us
another day or two to find this ship.

2173
02:34:36,225 --> 02:34:42,812
TALIESIN: Well, not necessarily. Every day we scry.
Every day we hone in. We keep following where

2174
02:34:42,812 --> 02:34:43,932
they're going.

2175
02:34:43,932 --> 02:34:46,066
MARISHA: Ideally, she does the hard work for us.

2176
02:34:46,066 --> 02:34:55,017
TRAVIS: It's worth noting as well that if we do
find this ship, we do not mean her well.

2177
02:34:55,017 --> 02:34:59,013
MATT: "I can only assume, going to Hespet."

2178
02:34:59,013 --> 02:35:04,482
MARISHA: You seem very familiar with this place.
Do you have more information?

2179
02:35:04,482 --> 02:35:06,212
LIAM: Or apprehension?

2180
02:35:06,212 --> 02:35:12,989
MATT: "Hespit is a-- the whole network of islands
there is a haven for criminals, fugitives,

2181
02:35:12,989 --> 02:35:18,808
"pirates, and everyone else who generally keeps
away from the large continents. So you go without

2182
02:35:18,808 --> 02:35:24,203
"guard, stay without threat, you're likely to be
bent into slavery, or end up left bleeding

2183
02:35:24,203 --> 02:35:25,828
"somewhere on the shoreline."

2184
02:35:25,828 --> 02:35:28,049
TRAVIS: Is that a promise?

2185
02:35:28,049 --> 02:35:29,534
LAURA: We're super powerful.

2186
02:35:29,534 --> 02:35:33,141
LIAM: You do the flying. We'll do the fucking shit
up.

2187
02:35:33,141 --> 02:35:38,107
MATT: "We'll have to come in low, most likely. I
don't want to try and draw attention to this ship,

2188
02:35:38,107 --> 02:35:42,659
"because I'm sure it would fetch quite a penny if
it were to fall into the hands of--"

2189
02:35:42,659 --> 02:35:45,320
TRAVIS: I'm sure Keyleth would provide you with
some cover as well.

2190
02:35:45,320 --> 02:35:48,747
MATT: "Well, that would be very much appreciated."

2191
02:35:48,747 --> 02:35:50,052
MARISHA: I could do that.

2192
02:35:50,052 --> 02:35:55,661
MATT: "Thankfully Glintshore itself is pretty much
useless to most of their standards of business

2193
02:35:55,661 --> 02:36:02,768
"practices. It's mostly ignored by them, from what
I know at least of what they do, but still, just

2194
02:36:02,768 --> 02:36:04,397
"to be safe and be careful."

2195
02:36:04,397 --> 02:36:10,714
SAM: Has Teera been around there? Does she know
anything of that particular shipwreck?

2196
02:36:10,714 --> 02:36:17,249
MATT: He's about to talk and Teera pipes up, "I
do, actually, and I will be guiding us directly to

2197
02:36:17,249 --> 02:36:18,890
"it, so don't worry."

2198
02:36:18,890 --> 02:36:20,089
SAM: To the shipwreck?

2199
02:36:20,089 --> 02:36:21,993
MATT: "Not to the shipwreck, but to the
Glintshore."

2200
02:36:21,993 --> 02:36:26,354
SAM: Have you heard of that shipwreck? The Shrew?

2201
02:36:26,354 --> 02:36:31,948
MATT: "I have not. But there are plenty of
shipwrecks in the area. I'm sure there's much to

2202
02:36:31,948 --> 02:36:33,849
"recover, if that's what you're looking for."

2203
02:36:33,849 --> 02:36:37,247
LAURA: No, we'll stick with the Shrew.

2204
02:36:37,247 --> 02:36:42,229
MATT: "I'll take you where I can."

2205
02:36:42,229 --> 02:36:54,348
TRAVIS: The island of glass, is it called that
because of a glass production site?

2206
02:36:54,348 --> 02:36:58,516
(laughter)

2207
02:36:58,516 --> 02:36:59,708
SAM: Yep.

2208
02:36:59,708 --> 02:37:01,355
LAURA: Was that hard for you, Grog?

2209
02:37:01,355 --> 02:37:02,895
TRAVIS: I hurt myself.

2210
02:37:02,895 --> 02:37:15,823
MATT: Captain Damon says, "I don't know the
history, exactly, but at some point in time,

2211
02:37:15,823 --> 02:37:24,141
"something really bad happened. All the sand of the
shores were fused into dark brown and black glass.

2212
02:37:24,141 --> 02:37:31,118
"It's a jagged landscape, leading all the way up to
the mountain. The jungle is petrified and dead.

2213
02:37:31,118 --> 02:37:39,670
"It's not a welcoming place. I'm surprised why
anyone would pay so much to go there. But I'm sure

2214
02:37:39,670 --> 02:37:40,953
"you have your reasons."

2215
02:37:40,953 --> 02:37:44,009
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see if that
sounds familiar?

2216
02:37:44,009 --> 02:37:45,847
MATT: Sure.

2217
02:37:45,847 --> 02:37:53,386
MARISHA: Beasts or something that would happen--
Heat, a lot of fucking heat. 26.

2218
02:37:53,440 --> 02:38:06,117
MATT: To fuse the beaches, or an island its
entirety, would require such extreme, fierce heat.

2219
02:38:06,268 --> 02:38:09,724
This is going through your mind as well, Percy,
being a man who understands this science very

2220
02:38:09,724 --> 02:38:18,768
well. Something very bad had to have happened here
a long time ago on a very large scale to render an

2221
02:38:18,768 --> 02:38:21,886
island pretty much covered in glass.

2222
02:38:21,886 --> 02:38:29,860
LAURA: Do you think this is where they knocked
Thordak down? Didn't they fight Thordak in the

2223
02:38:29,860 --> 02:38:30,992
ocean?

2224
02:38:30,992 --> 02:38:34,867
MARISHA: That's what my thought was. Would a
dragon's breath?

2225
02:38:34,867 --> 02:38:40,778
MATT: A dragon's breath would fuse a small chunk
of the beach here.

2226
02:38:40,778 --> 02:38:46,194
MARISHA: What about if a bunch of sorcerers and
magic users got together and made a big nuke?

2227
02:38:46,194 --> 02:38:53,008
MATT: That's possible. Very little chance there
would be any survivors.

2228
02:38:53,008 --> 02:38:56,221
LIAM: Like a meteor or a comet from the sky.

2229
02:38:56,221 --> 02:39:04,419
TALIESIN: Even a comet wouldn't be enough. This is
big.

2230
02:39:04,419 --> 02:39:05,862
MARISHA: Keyteor.

2231
02:39:05,862 --> 02:39:11,687
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation, he
goes, "The mountain still stands. The jungle still

2232
02:39:11,687 --> 02:39:16,949
"stands, though petrified and burnt. I know not the
means that brought it to where it is, but it's

2233
02:39:16,949 --> 02:39:21,334
"been that way for as long as we have history on
it. Long ago."

2234
02:39:21,334 --> 02:39:26,682
MARISHA: How long ago was it?

2235
02:39:26,682 --> 02:39:32,009
MATT: "I'm assuming the Age of Arcanum if
anything."

2236
02:39:32,009 --> 02:39:38,182
TRAVIS: Right. You said we have quarters on this
ship; do you mind if I sleep under the stars?

2237
02:39:38,182 --> 02:39:40,635
MATT: "Be my guest."

2238
02:39:40,635 --> 02:39:45,277
TRAVIS: Rocking. Going to commune with nature in
my own way. Fart in the wind.

2239
02:39:45,277 --> 02:39:47,379
TALIESIN: I'm going to be far away from that.

2240
02:39:47,379 --> 02:39:51,847
TRAVIS: No one wants to join me? Get all hippie up
on the deck of the ship?

2241
02:39:51,847 --> 02:39:55,462
LAURA: I'll do that! I'll sleep out, and Trinket
will want to do that as well.

2242
02:39:55,462 --> 02:39:57,237
LIAM: I actually do, yeah.

2243
02:39:57,237 --> 02:39:58,591
MATT: (bear noises)

2244
02:39:58,591 --> 02:40:02,179
LAURA: Stars, Trinket. Beautiful.

2245
02:40:02,179 --> 02:40:06,423
LIAM: Speaking of heat, make with the bed farts,
Trinket. I get cold at night.

2246
02:40:06,423 --> 02:40:15,487
SAM: Keyleth, make sure you learn your scrying
spells for tomorrow. Do we still have that ball,

2247
02:40:15,487 --> 02:40:16,999
the scry-ball?

2248
02:40:16,999 --> 02:40:18,061
MATT: Yep.

2249
02:40:18,061 --> 02:40:21,005
LAURA: We'll have two scrys tomorrow if you learn
the spell.

2250
02:40:21,005 --> 02:40:26,708
MARISHA: I could theoretically do three scrys
tomorrow. I could <i>theoretically</i> do <i>five</i> scrys

2251
02:40:26,708 --> 02:40:28,010
tomorrow.

2252
02:40:28,010 --> 02:40:36,172
TRAVIS: I pay super close attention, but after we
gave them the destination, did they tell us how

2253
02:40:36,172 --> 02:40:37,485
long it would take?

2254
02:40:37,485 --> 02:40:39,337
SAM: Two, three days.

2255
02:40:39,337 --> 02:40:40,696
MATT: Depending on the weather.

2256
02:40:40,696 --> 02:40:46,703
TRAVIS: What if we pass over the ship in the
night?

2257
02:40:46,703 --> 02:40:49,963
TALIESIN: Then we'll attack them in the night.

2258
02:40:49,963 --> 02:40:53,821
SAM: How will we see them? Is there someone who
stands watch at night?

2259
02:40:53,821 --> 02:40:58,514
MARISHA: She knows where we're going, so she'll
let us know if we get there?

2260
02:40:58,514 --> 02:41:02,040
SAM: But we're looking for the boat, not the
island.

2261
02:41:02,040 --> 02:41:05,976
TALIESIN: The boat itself. There's work that
always needs to be done. There'll be lights,

2262
02:41:05,976 --> 02:41:08,016
unless they are hiding.

2263
02:41:08,016 --> 02:41:12,197
LIAM: You can alert one of us if we come upon a
ship in the night or day, correct?

2264
02:41:12,197 --> 02:41:16,576
MATT: "I have to sleep at some point as well."

2265
02:41:16,576 --> 02:41:18,738
LIAM: Of course, but someone is awake?

2266
02:41:18,738 --> 02:41:22,273
MATT: "Deshall, who is my second in command, will
take over while I'm sleeping. There will be

2267
02:41:22,273 --> 02:41:26,640
"someone here, along with a few hands, taking
shifts as well at all times."

2268
02:41:26,640 --> 02:41:33,353
MARISHA: I describe the ship to them from what
I've seen.

2269
02:41:33,353 --> 02:41:37,362
LAURA: But it's in the ocean, isn't it? And we're
very high above it?

2270
02:41:37,362 --> 02:41:39,907
TRAVIS: Do we want to go lower?

2271
02:41:39,907 --> 02:41:43,697
SAM: Yes.

2272
02:41:43,697 --> 02:41:45,809
TRAVIS: How high off the deck, would you say?

2273
02:41:45,809 --> 02:41:55,822
SAM: Off the sea? Three, maybe four feet? No. I
don't know, couple hundred feet? You're the captain.

2274
02:41:55,822 --> 02:42:00,596
MATT: "We're okay for now. High is fine. But once
we get close to the archipelago we'll want to make

2275
02:42:00,596 --> 02:42:06,135
"sure that we keep within 100 feet of the
surface. I could take it into the ocean. This can

2276
02:42:06,135 --> 02:42:08,127
"work as a functional ship in the water."

2277
02:42:08,127 --> 02:42:13,248
TRAVIS: Shut the hell up! Well, we want to stay
out, right now.

2278
02:42:13,248 --> 02:42:25,535
MATT: "Well then, you seem weary enough. You may
have your rest, and rest assured that we'll be to

2279
02:42:25,535 --> 02:42:32,443
"your destination as soon as this ship can carry
us. I'm going to rest myself." He goes down to his

2280
02:42:32,443 --> 02:42:42,205
quarters and Deshall takes over, who is
mid-thirties, grizzled, scruff on his chin, but

2281
02:42:42,205 --> 02:42:47,818
put together well, hair parted to one side, not a
man of many words. He takes over the helm and

2282
02:42:47,907 --> 02:42:53,679
keeps it going through the night. You guys go
ahead and rest for the evening?

2283
02:42:53,679 --> 02:42:57,187
LIAM: I'm going to meditate for an hour before
bed.

2284
02:42:57,187 --> 02:43:05,044
TRAVIS: Could I take a shot of the sandkheg
bottle? I would like to slowly start building up

2285
02:43:05,044 --> 02:43:06,507
an immunity.

2286
02:43:06,507 --> 02:43:12,011
MATT: All righty. Make a constitution saving
throw, Grog.

2287
02:43:12,011 --> 02:43:15,116
LIAM: (Grog voice) Meaning I would like to get 
fucked up on a regular basis.

2288
02:43:15,210 --> 02:43:16,568
TRAVIS: 29.

2289
02:43:16,568 --> 02:43:24,443
MATT: You drink it. You feel the sparkling
numbness begin to spread across your throat. It's

2290
02:43:24,443 --> 02:43:30,311
strange. It's weird. It's exhilarating. It
triggers your adrenaline, and you almost go into a

2291
02:43:30,311 --> 02:43:35,453
rage from the instinctual reaction of that sort of
chemical release in your brain. You hold it in

2292
02:43:35,453 --> 02:43:40,181
place, and you sit there a second and stare as it
slowly goes down your system. You feel the warm,

2293
02:43:40,181 --> 02:43:49,626
curling burn from inside your belly that fine
alcohol gives you, that little shimmer of pins and

2294
02:43:49,626 --> 02:43:53,731
needles down the back of your neck and your spine.
Your vision begins to blur a little bit. It takes

2295
02:43:53,731 --> 02:43:56,916
you a lot of alcohol to get trashed, but you're a
little buzzed.

2296
02:43:56,916 --> 02:44:05,156
TRAVIS: Sick. Awesome. Well played, sandkheg. I go
to sleep.

2297
02:44:05,156 --> 02:44:10,405
MATT: With your nightcap, you are good to go.
Looking under the stars, you finish your

2298
02:44:10,405 --> 02:44:16,359
meditation. Everyone else, you go to rest fine.
Throughout the evening you sleep. The last thing

2299
02:44:16,359 --> 02:44:24,681
you see before you go to bed is the edge of the
mountain range, late into the night, and a small

2300
02:44:24,681 --> 02:44:38,207
sparkle in a crescent shape. You ask one of the
hands to the side. He points over and says, "The

2301
02:44:38,207 --> 02:44:45,013
"Bay of Gifts." This is the northern side where you
see Shamal, the port city. That's the last little

2302
02:44:45,013 --> 02:44:50,456
bastion of civilization of Marquet as it begins to
approach from underneath as you all go to sleep.

2303
02:44:50,456 --> 02:44:53,966
The continent is behind you.

2304
02:44:53,966 --> 02:44:57,579
MARISHA: How many hours has it been?

2305
02:44:57,579 --> 02:45:00,311
MATT: When you come to consciousness after the
evening's rest--

2306
02:45:00,311 --> 02:45:08,236
LAURA: I want to hold Fenthras in my hand and keep
thinking about the things Saundor said.

2307
02:45:08,236 --> 02:45:17,574
MATT: After a good eight hour rest for all of you
to recover yourselves, hit points, everything,

2308
02:45:17,574 --> 02:45:34,368
spells, you come to. The warmth of the sun is what
kicks you into consciousness. It's been about 13

2309
02:45:34,368 --> 02:45:42,983
hours since you guys left. Eight hours of rest.
You had five hours of travel northward until you

2310
02:45:42,983 --> 02:45:46,593
began to reach the northern end of the continent
on this skyship.

2311
02:45:46,593 --> 02:45:52,107
TALIESIN: This might be the best sleep that we've
gotten in months, at this point. Like babies.

2312
02:45:52,107 --> 02:45:57,786
SAM: Is it morning time?

2313
02:45:57,786 --> 02:45:58,979
MATT: Yeah.

2314
02:45:58,979 --> 02:46:01,003
SAM: You want to do that morning scry?

2315
02:46:01,003 --> 02:46:03,997
MARISHA: Yeah, morning scry.

2316
02:46:03,997 --> 02:46:06,763
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit down with a pen and
paper, ready to write!

2317
02:46:06,763 --> 02:46:17,109
MARISHA: Yeah, morning constitutional, here we
come. Bust out whatever magazines they have

2318
02:46:17,109 --> 02:46:21,481
nearby. Cup of coffee, first.

2319
02:46:21,481 --> 02:46:27,884
MATT: All right. Using the same journal?

2320
02:46:27,884 --> 02:46:33,352
TALIESIN: Let's use the gun now. Let's go nuts.

2321
02:46:33,352 --> 02:46:35,845
SAM: Now that it's been de-cursed, will that mess
up--

2322
02:46:35,845 --> 02:46:38,763
TALIESIN: It's got a lot of her work in it.

2323
02:46:38,763 --> 02:46:42,271
MATT: All right, are you using the crystal first?

2324
02:46:42,271 --> 02:46:45,347
MARISHA: Yeah. Crystal first.

2325
02:46:45,347 --> 02:46:50,416
MATT: What's the crystal DC? Because it's not your
actual spell, which I should have remembered last

2326
02:46:50,416 --> 02:46:55,009
time. I mean, she rolled low enough last time that
it wasn't an issue.

2327
02:46:55,009 --> 02:46:57,430
MARISHA: It doesn't say.

2328
02:46:57,430 --> 02:47:08,013
MATT: Okay, then it should be 15. That's a natural
one. As you're concentrating on the scry spell,

2329
02:47:08,013 --> 02:47:16,689
your vision once again is thrust through the
clouds, thrown down over the ocean. You see for a

2330
02:47:16,689 --> 02:47:28,486
brief moment a cluster of dark land, roughly in
the shape of a bean or a cashew from this

2331
02:47:28,486 --> 02:47:36,939
perspective, and then it flashes downward and you
can see a ship. A ship that is on the water. It is

2332
02:47:36,939 --> 02:47:38,160
stationary.

2333
02:47:38,160 --> 02:47:40,222
MARISHA: Docked, like anchors down?

2334
02:47:40,222 --> 02:47:43,107
MATT: Seemingly. The sails aren't up.

2335
02:47:43,107 --> 02:47:45,688
TRAVIS: It's not at land? It's in the water?

2336
02:47:45,688 --> 02:47:54,313
MATT: Yeah. Your vision flashes again and you can
see the crew have all gathered on the deck, though

2337
02:47:54,313 --> 02:48:06,295
details of their visage are obscured by the spell.
You see Ripley there with her cloak. She is

2338
02:48:06,295 --> 02:48:15,206
talking to the rest of the crew and goes, "All
right, so. We've located it. We have eight hours.

2339
02:48:15,206 --> 02:48:22,730
"Gather your things and drink well." They all pull
out these small vials, uncork, and drink down.

2340
02:48:22,730 --> 02:48:39,140
They all nod. One by one, they start diving off
the ship and into the water. Five people, you're

2341
02:48:39,140 --> 02:48:46,326
not sure of the sex, and Ripley, dive off the
side. You're following her as she goes underwater;

2342
02:48:46,326 --> 02:48:51,221
you can see the bubbles go past. Then the bubbles
are no more and you watch as she is now breathing

2343
02:48:51,221 --> 02:48:57,344
the water like it's air. Swimming downward. All of
them are carrying, you see on the side, these

2344
02:48:57,344 --> 02:49:02,649
heavy rock weights that are letting them guide
down deeper into the water as it gets darker,

2345
02:49:02,649 --> 02:49:11,074
until there's almost nothing to see. Then there's
a flicker of light and you see Ripley is now

2346
02:49:11,074 --> 02:49:17,112
holding her gun. There's a beam of light on the
end of it that's giving them torchlight as they go

2347
02:49:17,112 --> 02:49:26,387
deeper in. Then the spell fades.

2348
02:49:26,387 --> 02:49:30,372
MARISHA: She's found it. She's there.

2349
02:49:30,372 --> 02:49:31,725
TRAVIS: She's got it?

2350
02:49:31,725 --> 02:49:37,305
MARISHA: She doesn't have it, but she's found the
ship. She's right off the shore of the island.

2351
02:49:37,305 --> 02:49:39,363
LAURA: Can you scry again immediately?

2352
02:49:39,363 --> 02:49:43,114
MARISHA: She's under the water. I mean, I could.

2353
02:49:43,114 --> 02:49:44,779
TRAVIS: How is she under the water?

2354
02:49:44,779 --> 02:49:48,795
MARISHA: They all took water breathing potions.
Her plus five other people.

2355
02:49:48,795 --> 02:49:55,827
TALIESIN: Was there anything around? Could you see
the island in sight?

2356
02:49:55,827 --> 02:50:00,576
MARISHA: I saw the island. It was dark in
landscape.

2357
02:50:00,576 --> 02:50:06,953
MATT: It was such a brief shot, because it wasn't
the focus of the scry spell. Even the fact that

2358
02:50:06,953 --> 02:50:14,065
you caught a glimpse of it was a strange side
effect of the scry attempt.

2359
02:50:14,065 --> 02:50:19,733
TALIESIN: Was the sun with the island, or was the
sun away from the island? Is there any way to even

2360
02:50:19,733 --> 02:50:22,464
know that? Were they on the north side or the
south side?

2361
02:50:22,464 --> 02:50:29,284
MATT: From what you can gather at this time, no.
That's part of the scry spell. You wouldn't be

2362
02:50:29,284 --> 02:50:30,440
able to tell.

2363
02:50:30,440 --> 02:50:35,213
LIAM: I'm heading over to find the captain and the
halfling to ask how far they estimate we are from

2364
02:50:35,213 --> 02:50:36,571
the island.

2365
02:50:36,571 --> 02:50:38,582
MARISHA: I heard Ripley say, "We have eight
hours."

2366
02:50:38,582 --> 02:50:42,028
LAURA: That's how long the spell lasts.

2367
02:50:42,028 --> 02:50:45,175
TRAVIS: I have two vials of underwater breathing.

2368
02:50:45,175 --> 02:50:49,922
MARISHA: I'll take water breathing as a spell.

2369
02:50:49,922 --> 02:50:52,265
LAURA: How many people can you cast it on?

2370
02:50:52,265 --> 02:51:02,191
MATT: Water breathing as a spell actually lasts
for 24 hours. The potions only last for eight.

2371
02:51:02,191 --> 02:51:04,330
MARISHA: Is it concentration?

2372
02:51:04,330 --> 02:51:07,771
MATT: Nope. It grants up to ten willing creatures
you can see--

2373
02:51:07,771 --> 02:51:09,566
MARISHA: What!? Ten willing?

2374
02:51:09,566 --> 02:51:10,908
LAURA: That's sick.

2375
02:51:10,908 --> 02:51:13,080
MARISHA: I got us on lock, you guys.

2376
02:51:13,080 --> 02:51:16,629
TALIESIN: I had a plan. I'm putting it away.

2377
02:51:16,629 --> 02:51:25,002
MATT: Yeah, so the potion enchantments are lesser
than the spell, but the actual druidic spell

2378
02:51:25,002 --> 02:51:31,998
effect is much better. You see him looking off in
the distance as you're asking the question. He

2379
02:51:31,998 --> 02:51:38,271
points and goes, "Well given <i>that</i> might slow us
down a bit--" You look ahead and you now see,

2380
02:51:38,271 --> 02:51:40,582
immediately visible from this point--

2381
02:51:40,582 --> 02:51:44,662
LAURA: Don't be a green dragon!

2382
02:51:44,662 --> 02:52:00,389
MATT: What you are able to make out, because it's
a familiar sight to you, are very tall, dark,

2383
02:52:00,389 --> 02:52:08,459
distant thunderheads. The storm that you saw in
your first vision, Keyleth, apparently is still

2384
02:52:08,459 --> 02:52:13,906
swirling its way through the middle of the ocean.
It's violent, it's visceral, and you can see the

2385
02:52:13,906 --> 02:52:19,528
weight of the water giving it this deep, dark,
gray color, and the rest of the ocean below is

2386
02:52:19,528 --> 02:52:26,228
obscured with the blur of rainfall. He goes,
"Those are high clouds. I can't get above them.

2387
02:52:26,228 --> 02:52:31,739
"The enchantment is only so strong to get us into
that thinner air. So I recommend everyone hold on."

2388
02:52:31,739 --> 02:52:33,618
LIAM: Is there anything you can do about this?

2389
02:52:33,618 --> 02:52:35,212
MARISHA: I can. Get us closer.

2390
02:52:35,212 --> 02:52:36,578
MATT: "What?"

2391
02:52:36,578 --> 02:52:39,067
TALIESIN: Trust her. She's crazy.

2392
02:52:39,067 --> 02:52:44,032
MARISHA: Straight through, fastest route,
captain.

2393
02:52:44,032 --> 02:52:49,089
MATT: "Okay, I trust you." He brings it around and
begins pulling forward. You can see this little

2394
02:52:49,089 --> 02:52:53,759
metallic rod on the side and he pushes it forward
even further. The crystals flicker for a second

2395
02:52:53,759 --> 02:53:07,877
and the whole ship leans in a forward direction.
It takes about an hour before the shade from the

2396
02:53:07,877 --> 02:53:14,023
thunderheads, which, you can't even see where they
stop, they go up and up and up, begin to meet.

2397
02:53:14,023 --> 02:53:17,163
You're starting to see flashes in the clouds of
lightning.

2398
02:53:17,163 --> 02:53:30,619
MARISHA: I go ahead and I start casting my first
8th-level spell, which is Control Weather. It's

2399
02:53:30,619 --> 02:53:37,316
everything I've ever wanted, you guys!

2400
02:53:37,316 --> 02:53:46,425
MATT: Yeah, concentration for up to eight hours.
So you guys watch as Keyleth stands at the bow of

2401
02:53:46,425 --> 02:53:53,136
the ship, puts her arms out, and you see the
flashes of lightning in the cloud. A bolt strikes

2402
02:53:53,136 --> 02:54:00,202
her in one arm. She holds it in place. The bolt
uses her as a conduit and then vanishes into her

2403
02:54:00,202 --> 02:54:05,899
arm. Her other arm pulls another bolt to it, and
it vanishes into her arm. You can see the energy's

2404
02:54:05,899 --> 02:54:11,047
now circling around. She brings her arms out and
thrusts them into the storm. The lightning

2405
02:54:11,047 --> 02:54:17,364
protrudes out of each arm. As it hits the clouds,
the clouds seem to almost melt away and carve this

2406
02:54:17,364 --> 02:54:24,478
central path. The clouds are being pushed back, at
gale force. These winds are separating them. You

2407
02:54:24,478 --> 02:54:30,520
watch. For five miles around you, the storm
basically parts to nearly nothing except for the

2408
02:54:30,520 --> 02:54:38,159
very peripheral to the right and left side. You
hear Captain Damon go, "Okay! I see your point."

2409
02:54:38,159 --> 02:54:42,809
LIAM: Hot fucking damn, Keyleth!

2410
02:54:42,809 --> 02:54:48,677
LAURA: You know, I thought it was a possibility,
but this is the first time I'm sure your

2411
02:54:48,677 --> 02:54:50,841
girlfriend is way cooler than you.

2412
02:54:50,841 --> 02:54:52,747
LIAM: Everyone knew that.

2413
02:54:52,747 --> 02:55:02,748
MATT: So pushing forward, Keyleth is concentrating
at the edge of the ship. Her eyes spark with

2414
02:55:02,748 --> 02:55:06,499
energy. You're almost like the mermaid at the
front of the ship at this point. You're right at

2415
02:55:06,499 --> 02:55:07,596
the front, arms out.

2416
02:55:07,596 --> 02:55:10,816
LIAM: You're like a reverse Pyro. You're undoing
all the violence.

2417
02:55:10,816 --> 02:55:17,972
MATT: The shade fades away. The clear blue sky
above then invites these warm sun beams down upon

2418
02:55:17,972 --> 02:55:19,446
the top of the ship.

2419
02:55:19,446 --> 02:55:21,034
LAURA: I do some sunbathing.

2420
02:55:21,034 --> 02:55:26,284
MARISHA: I make it temperate with a nice warm
breeze.

2421
02:55:26,284 --> 02:55:30,666
SAM: Keyleth, can you make the breeze behind us,
and can you make it rather strong?

2422
02:55:30,666 --> 02:55:33,752
MARISHA: Can I do that?

2423
02:55:33,752 --> 02:55:38,746
TALIESIN: He's reading! He doesn't know.

2424
02:55:38,746 --> 02:55:43,035
SAM: Well, you said it lasts eight hours.

2425
02:55:43,035 --> 02:55:47,592
TALIESIN: He's checking to see if it's a thing you
can actually do.

2426
02:55:47,592 --> 02:55:49,573
LIAM: Checking his stocks. Message from mom.

2427
02:55:49,573 --> 02:56:00,477
MATT: What you can do is you can clear the storm
for five miles, and then subtly change to a wind

2428
02:56:00,477 --> 02:56:03,979
stage behind you, yes. I'll let you do that,
sure.

2429
02:56:03,979 --> 02:56:09,077
MARISHA: Make the winds in our favor! I'm drunk on
power!

2430
02:56:09,077 --> 02:56:13,949
MATT: The wind begins to build from behind. Some
of you have to duck down now because it's starting

2431
02:56:13,949 --> 02:56:21,154
to take. It almost takes your hat off, Scanlan.
You catch it. But it is picking up speed and you

2432
02:56:21,154 --> 02:56:26,701
guys are beginning to coast forward. Occasionally
the winds die down as you have to clear more of

2433
02:56:26,701 --> 02:56:33,016
the storm. Over the next six or so hours, you come
out the other side of the storm.

2434
02:56:33,016 --> 02:56:39,574
MARISHA: I go into a deep meditation. This is some
Buddhist shit going on for me right now.

2435
02:56:39,574 --> 02:56:53,064
MATT: Perfect. As the storm subsides, your ship
has a clear view of distant breaks in the patterns

2436
02:56:53,064 --> 02:57:01,129
of waves on the horizon. Multiple chained islands,
many miles apart from each other, emerge. This,

2437
02:57:01,129 --> 02:57:06,219
you've now begun to reach, is the Hespet
Archipelago. Each of the twelve islands vary in

2438
02:57:06,219 --> 02:57:15,609
size from massive rock to pebble-like protrusions.
They span and are scattered, and the ship begins

2439
02:57:15,609 --> 02:57:24,195
to veer to the left as the captain begins to zero
in on your destination. He yells out, "We're going

2440
02:57:24,195 --> 02:57:33,407
"low! They have visibility!" The ship begins to go
into a relatively steep decline. You hear the wood

2441
02:57:33,407 --> 02:57:42,014
creaking with the sudden shift in direction and
weight. The gem on the right side begins to

2442
02:57:42,014 --> 02:57:47,979
brighten while the one on the left begins to
darken slightly, exemplifying the shift in energy

2443
02:57:47,979 --> 02:57:52,782
and power. Eventually you're brought down, nearly
coasting on the surface of the ocean, and as you

2444
02:57:52,782 --> 02:57:58,278
get to about 40, 50 feet above you see the waves
begin to part beneath it as whatever force is

2445
02:57:58,278 --> 02:58:03,040
holding it there is now pushing the water down. He
brings it up a little so it's not breaking the

2446
02:58:03,040 --> 02:58:12,543
surface and coasts at an even 60 feet above.
Pushing forward, you already begin to see what you

2447
02:58:12,543 --> 02:58:22,542
assume is the Isle of Glintshore. In this clear,
sunlit moment, you also see, throughout the ocean,

2448
02:58:22,542 --> 02:58:32,999
clusters of dangerous, jagged-looking reef, some
ten, 15 below the surface, some actually breaching

2449
02:58:32,999 --> 02:58:39,725
the surface of the ocean, some even deeper. This
portion of the ocean is like a maze network of

2450
02:58:39,725 --> 02:58:48,725
every ship captain's nightmare. You get the
feeling why this has become a favored place of

2451
02:58:48,725 --> 02:58:58,196
criminals to avoid pursuers and also why people
who trade avoid it for many reasons, not just

2452
02:58:58,196 --> 02:59:06,189
those who stay here. And also why the shipwreck
probably found its way here. As you begin to grow

2453
02:59:06,189 --> 02:59:12,610
closer to the island, you see, as it begins to
come more into form, there is a singular mountain

2454
02:59:12,610 --> 02:59:20,781
peak that's shifted mostly to the western side.
It's not a super peak. It's a gradual point. You

2455
02:59:20,781 --> 02:59:28,773
can see a little bit of a brush-like detail of the
jungle that you had heard mentioned before. He

2456
02:59:28,773 --> 02:59:36,161
begins to bring you up towards the southern shore
of the island. At this point of perspective, the

2457
02:59:36,161 --> 02:59:42,694
sunlight that's hitting the island is causing a
glittery shift of thousands of points of light

2458
02:59:42,694 --> 02:59:51,557
across the beach shoreline, deep into where the
blackened jungle tree line is. It's beautiful.

2459
02:59:51,557 --> 02:59:59,735
It's a very strange and awe-inspiring sight, to be
such a small little forgotten part of the land and

2460
02:59:59,735 --> 03:00:01,687
to look so pretty from this distance.

2461
03:00:01,687 --> 03:00:08,525
The closer you get, the beauty begins to
fade as you see the black beaches. You can see the

2462
03:00:08,525 --> 03:00:19,076
landscape is barren and broken, aside from the
ashen gray and black jungle plants and trees that

2463
03:00:19,174 --> 03:00:24,236
have been left there, dead, for an extended period
of time. The mountain itself, the rock itself

2464
03:00:24,236 --> 03:00:30,861
going from black to a ruddy red and brown color.
The sands themselves and the glass surface across

2465
03:00:30,861 --> 03:00:38,599
the eastern shore that tends to reach out, almost
like a mouth of a creature, is rough and varied in

2466
03:00:38,599 --> 03:00:47,705
topography. You also see, within that bay, a tiny
little thing that looks like a ship.

2467
03:00:47,705 --> 03:00:51,596
LIAM: Are we close enough to see if there's people
on the deck?

2468
03:00:51,596 --> 03:00:54,702
MATT: You're not close enough. You're barely now
seeing that there's a ship.

2469
03:00:54,702 --> 03:00:58,361
MARISHA: It's been six hours, you said, since I
did my scry.

2470
03:00:58,361 --> 03:01:00,774
MATT: Probably about seven hours now, since you
did the spell.

2471
03:01:00,774 --> 03:01:02,509
LAURA: They're going to be coming out any minute.

2472
03:01:02,509 --> 03:01:04,335
MARISHA: They have one hour left.

2473
03:01:04,335 --> 03:01:05,639
LAURA: Unless they're already out.

2474
03:01:05,639 --> 03:01:09,373
LIAM: Yeah, that's the duration of the spell, the
eight hours. They could be back already.

2475
03:01:09,373 --> 03:01:12,507
MARISHA: If we have one hour left, they could
fail. They could not find it at all.

2476
03:01:12,507 --> 03:01:16,444
LAURA: Could we shoot the boat from above and
destroy their escape?

2477
03:01:16,444 --> 03:01:23,477
TRAVIS: Could I make a song request? Could we drop
your big rocky ass from 300 feet up right through

2478
03:01:23,477 --> 03:01:25,181
the bottom of their ship and sink that bitch?

2479
03:01:25,181 --> 03:01:27,511
TALIESIN: I'll also say, there's nothing a ship
doesn't like more than fire.

2480
03:01:27,511 --> 03:01:29,053
LAURA: Yes.

2481
03:01:29,053 --> 03:01:33,711
MARISHA: I mean, all of these things are very
appealing to me right now. I'm just trying to

2482
03:01:33,711 --> 03:01:37,453
understand why.

2483
03:01:37,453 --> 03:01:38,710
SAM: Well, we can't let them escape.

2484
03:01:38,710 --> 03:01:42,862
LIAM: It's better that they're floating on the
water than standing on the ship.

2485
03:01:42,862 --> 03:01:45,059
TRAVIS: And if they have a teleportation circle on
the boat, we want to destroy it.

2486
03:01:45,059 --> 03:01:47,752
MARISHA: She also has the cloak we want.

2487
03:01:47,752 --> 03:01:51,704
LAURA: Right. So we wait until she drowns, and
then we take it from her.

2488
03:01:51,704 --> 03:01:54,203
TALIESIN: We can retrieve it from the bottom of
the sea, if we have to.

2489
03:01:54,203 --> 03:01:59,831
MARISHA: What do we know about magical items? Do
they get destroyed by things like fire or me being

2490
03:01:59,831 --> 03:02:00,707
a meteor?

2491
03:02:00,707 --> 03:02:04,667
MATT: Generally, no. Magical items, a part of the
enchantment is to make them resistant to the

2492
03:02:04,667 --> 03:02:12,173
general elements. They endure, and the reason that
you find mostly just the enchanted objects in

2493
03:02:12,173 --> 03:02:18,111
ancient ruins is because everything that would be
destroyed by the weathering of time, these items

2494
03:02:18,111 --> 03:02:19,679
stay relatively pristine.

2495
03:02:19,679 --> 03:02:21,615
MARISHA: Then yes, I'm down to fuck this shit up.

2496
03:02:21,615 --> 03:02:30,295
LAURA: I wonder if she hired the boat, or if it's
hers. I would hate to kill innocent crew members.

2497
03:02:30,295 --> 03:02:33,796
TALIESIN: I don't think they're innocent crew
members. I think she had help.

2498
03:02:33,796 --> 03:02:36,268
SAM: She had five killers with her when she killed
those--

2499
03:02:36,268 --> 03:02:44,374
MATT: You did see, for the record, in your
scrying, while there were five that leapt down

2500
03:02:44,374 --> 03:02:45,965
with her, there were more on the ship.

2501
03:02:45,965 --> 03:02:48,962
SAM: It's fine, we'll throw them a life raft or
something.

2502
03:02:48,962 --> 03:02:53,840
LIAM: Then I'd like to put my vote in for the
meteor.

2503
03:02:53,840 --> 03:02:57,355
TRAVIS: They're also in the bay, so they can swim
to shore.

2504
03:02:57,355 --> 03:03:05,759
LIAM: Well, we can stop their retreat. They're
going to be in worse shape without that boat.

2505
03:03:05,759 --> 03:03:08,387
TRAVIS: I want to send a message to the ship, is
all.

2506
03:03:08,387 --> 03:03:15,611
MATT: The captain's like, "What do you want me to
do? Do you want me to head for the ship?"

2507
03:03:15,611 --> 03:03:17,150
SAM: Up above the ship.

2508
03:03:17,150 --> 03:03:22,921
TRAVIS: And Vax rides Keyleth down, like Dr.
Strangelove, the whole way.

2509
03:03:22,921 --> 03:03:30,556
SAM: You're going to take a lot of damage?

2510
03:03:30,556 --> 03:03:33,832
MARISHA: He can fly.

2511
03:03:33,832 --> 03:03:40,515
LAURA: Can you cast Water Breathing on us before
you fly down, and that way-- or is that going to

2512
03:03:40,515 --> 03:03:42,185
fuck up your spells?

2513
03:03:42,185 --> 03:03:45,949
MARISHA: It's not a concentration spell, right?
Water breathing?

2514
03:03:45,949 --> 03:03:47,599
MATT: No, it's not concentration.

2515
03:03:47,599 --> 03:03:49,146
LIAM: And it lasts a long time.

2516
03:03:49,146 --> 03:03:53,000
LAURA: 24 hours. So just in case we end up in the
water, we're not fucked.

2517
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:55,231
TALIESIN: We have ten people, 12 people?

2518
03:03:55,231 --> 03:04:02,752
TRAVIS: Last song request. We destroy the ship,
right? It (burbling) and they all (burbling) come

2519
03:04:02,752 --> 03:04:08,430
up to the top, they got to go one place, which is
where? The shore. So why don't we wait on the shore?

2520
03:04:08,430 --> 03:04:11,109
MARISHA: Well do we want to drop your ass off on
the shore?

2521
03:04:11,109 --> 03:04:14,927
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, I mean, I'd love to be a
welcoming party. I'm just saying, if anyone else

2522
03:04:14,927 --> 03:04:17,902
wants to come with, that's where I know they'll be
going.

2523
03:04:17,902 --> 03:04:20,412
TALIESIN: I'm hoping to take care of this before
the ship even sinks.

2524
03:04:20,412 --> 03:04:22,125
LAURA: I can be death from above on the broom.

2525
03:04:22,125 --> 03:04:27,983
MARISHA: This is my favorite plan we've come up
with in a long time.

2526
03:04:27,983 --> 03:04:30,664
SAM: We should probably make sure that this is the
right boat.

2527
03:04:30,664 --> 03:04:34,261
LAURA: Yes, yes, we need to double check that this
is actually the boat.

2528
03:04:34,261 --> 03:04:36,971
MARISHA: Does this look like the right boat?

2529
03:04:36,971 --> 03:04:38,935
MATT: You're a little ways from it. Are you going
to wait until you get closer?

2530
03:04:38,935 --> 03:04:42,267
TRAVIS: Is there a telescope on this ship?

2531
03:04:42,267 --> 03:04:44,676
MATT: There is one that you've been using.

2532
03:04:44,676 --> 03:04:48,001
LAURA: Can you cast a spell, just in case shit
happens, as soon as we get close enough to the ship?

2533
03:04:48,001 --> 03:04:49,312
MARISHA: Dispel?

2534
03:04:49,312 --> 03:04:51,380
LAURA: No, the spell, the breathing spell.

2535
03:04:51,380 --> 03:04:55,549
MARISHA: Oh, yeah. What's our ETA, captain?

2536
03:04:55,549 --> 03:05:01,340
MATT: "At this speed, I'd say 20 minutes."

2537
03:05:01,340 --> 03:05:10,258
MARISHA: I'll wait ten minutes, because I like to
milk my time.

2538
03:05:10,258 --> 03:05:17,370
MATT: All right, ten minutes go by. Who is keeping
watch through the telescope?

2539
03:05:17,370 --> 03:05:18,514
LAURA: Me.

2540
03:05:18,514 --> 03:05:20,852
MATT: All right, make a perception check.

2541
03:05:20,852 --> 03:05:22,834
SAM: Wait, but Keyleth knows what the boat looks
like.

2542
03:05:22,834 --> 03:05:24,440
LAURA: She told me all about it.

2543
03:05:24,440 --> 03:05:25,602
MARISHA: Yeah.

2544
03:05:25,602 --> 03:05:31,603
LAURA: 25.

2545
03:05:31,603 --> 03:05:36,664
MATT: 25, all right. You're scanning across.
Looking at the ship: the sails are up, it is

2546
03:05:36,664 --> 03:05:44,503
anchored, and there are maybe four individuals who
are currently playing cards on the upper deck.

2547
03:05:44,503 --> 03:05:46,794
LAURA: It looks like the boat's been docked there
for a while.

2548
03:05:46,794 --> 03:05:53,464
MATT: You also notice, scanning the area, it
catches your eye, there's a very lazy, very faint

2549
03:05:53,464 --> 03:06:00,391
trail that looks like smoke on the shore of the
C-shaped bay on the eastern side of the island.

2550
03:06:00,391 --> 03:06:10,194
LAURA: A camp on the shoreline?

2551
03:06:10,194 --> 03:06:12,877
MATT: That might be a source for the smoke.

2552
03:06:12,877 --> 03:06:14,544
LAURA: Is it close by the boat?

2553
03:06:14,544 --> 03:06:21,240
MATT: If you're looking from your perspective,
this is the eastern side and it has this C-shaped

2554
03:06:21,240 --> 03:06:27,928
bay right here, where this is the shoreline. The
ship is docked right about here in the water. It's

2555
03:06:27,928 --> 03:06:32,137
surrounded by a reef. It's barely made its way in
there and it can't go any further without hitting

2556
03:06:32,137 --> 03:06:36,817
reef. The smoke is right there. It's right on the
beach side.

2557
03:06:36,817 --> 03:06:40,488
TRAVIS: Can we see the other side of the island,
or the water on the other side, from this vantage point?

2558
03:06:40,488 --> 03:06:42,434
MATT: No, not from this vantage point.

2559
03:06:42,434 --> 03:06:50,546
LAURA: Can you scry and see if she's still
underwater, or if she's camping? Because I see smoke.

2560
03:06:50,546 --> 03:06:55,405
SAM: Can Keyleth look through the-- we have a
telescope of some sort?

2561
03:06:55,405 --> 03:06:57,182
MATT: There is a telescope, yeah.

2562
03:06:57,182 --> 03:07:01,456
SAM: Can she look and see if the boat looks right?
Did you see any identifying marks on the boat?

2563
03:07:01,456 --> 03:07:04,167
TALIESIN: It's not like there's going to be a
dozen of them out here.

2564
03:07:04,167 --> 03:07:05,830
LIAM: It would be a very big coincidence.

2565
03:07:05,830 --> 03:07:09,780
MARISHA: I look through the telescope. Does it
look like the same boat?

2566
03:07:09,780 --> 03:07:11,452
MATT: Perception check.

2567
03:07:11,452 --> 03:07:16,742
MARISHA: I rolled an 18, so 29.

2568
03:07:16,742 --> 03:07:22,916
MATT: Yes, this is very much the boat. Size,
color, shape, placement, this is the same ship.

2569
03:07:22,916 --> 03:07:24,872
TRAVIS: Thought we were getting ready to kill a
cruise ship.

2570
03:07:24,872 --> 03:07:26,355
MARISHA: Okay, so am I scrying?

2571
03:07:26,355 --> 03:07:28,508
LAURA: Well I guess you don't need to now.

2572
03:07:28,508 --> 03:07:32,627
SAM: We'd know if she's still underwater or if
she's on land.

2573
03:07:32,627 --> 03:07:35,151
LAURA: There's people on the boat waiting still.

2574
03:07:35,151 --> 03:07:40,681
MATT: You are ten minutes from getting there. It
takes ten minutes to cast scrying.

2575
03:07:40,681 --> 03:07:42,839
TRAVIS: No, we don't need it.

2576
03:07:42,839 --> 03:07:44,838
LAURA: But you should probably cast breathing.

2577
03:07:44,838 --> 03:07:47,213
MARISHA: It takes me 30 seconds to scry once I get
there.

2578
03:07:47,213 --> 03:07:48,671
SAM: Let's scry.

2579
03:07:48,671 --> 03:07:50,344
MARISHA: I'm going to scry.

2580
03:07:50,344 --> 03:07:52,207
LAURA: But cast breathing on us first.

2581
03:07:52,207 --> 03:07:54,550
MARISHA: I'm going to cast Water Breathing, and
then I'm going to scry.

2582
03:07:54,550 --> 03:07:55,995
TALIESIn: Wait, can you do me a favor?

2583
03:07:55,995 --> 03:08:00,757
MARISHA: I'm dishing them out. I'm the magic ATM
right now. What do you want?

2584
03:08:00,757 --> 03:08:07,052
TALIESIN: Once we're somewhat in the distance,
fire an eyeball and get a good look at that ship.

2585
03:08:07,052 --> 03:08:13,192
I want to see if it's a trap. You have an arrow.

2586
03:08:13,192 --> 03:08:15,945
LAURA: Yes, I do. Once we get close enough.

2587
03:08:15,945 --> 03:08:22,558
MARISHA: Okay, so I go to everybody and I say, you
have Water Breathing, you have Water Breathing.

2588
03:08:22,558 --> 03:08:34,744
And everyone has Water Breathing. Then I go,
everyone leave me alone for ten minutes. I drop

2589
03:08:34,744 --> 03:08:36,105
down and I Scry.

2590
03:08:36,105 --> 03:08:42,667
MATT: Okay. So you begin concentrating as you guys
get closer and closer to the ship. You can now see

2591
03:08:42,667 --> 03:08:44,251
it getting closer and closer.

2592
03:08:44,251 --> 03:08:46,961
TRAVIS: Do we want to raise our elevation as we're
getting closer?

2593
03:08:46,961 --> 03:08:49,809
SAM: Yeah, we told him to go up above it.

2594
03:08:49,809 --> 03:08:53,189
MATT: You guys begin to notice, you, Vex, as
you're looking through, the people who were

2595
03:08:53,189 --> 03:08:56,629
playing cards start moving on the deck of the
ship. They start scattering.

2596
03:08:56,629 --> 03:08:57,792
LAURA: Are they seeing us?

2597
03:08:57,792 --> 03:09:01,833
MATT: They have seen you. You're not a hard vision
to see once they pay attention.

2598
03:09:01,833 --> 03:09:06,902
LAURA: Do they look like they're looking over the
sides of the boat?

2599
03:09:06,902 --> 03:09:10,355
MATT: Roll a perception check.

2600
03:09:10,355 --> 03:09:17,311
SAM: This is like the Hindenburg flying up to a
rowboat.

2601
03:09:17,311 --> 03:09:18,662
LAURA: 20.

2602
03:09:18,662 --> 03:09:19,639
MATT: No.

2603
03:09:19,639 --> 03:09:21,349
LAURA: No, they don't look like they're looking
over the side of the boat?

2604
03:09:21,349 --> 03:09:27,597
MATT: No. Okay, you're starting to get closer and
closer. You watch as they all scatter into the

2605
03:09:27,597 --> 03:09:33,868
bottom of the boat, except for one who stands on
the deck. You watch, (launching sound) this one

2606
03:09:33,868 --> 03:09:39,420
sparkle of bright red arcane energy (fizzing) up
into the sky, (explosion)--

2607
03:09:39,420 --> 03:09:41,017
SAM: A flare.

2608
03:09:41,017 --> 03:09:48,432
MATT: --with a dull burst exploding sound, and
then vanishes. The explosion dissipates.

2609
03:09:48,432 --> 03:09:50,199
LAURA: Yeah, it's a flare.

2610
03:09:50,199 --> 03:09:52,815
SAM: To warn the people on land.

2611
03:09:52,815 --> 03:09:55,001
MATT: Another one (fizzing).

2612
03:09:55,001 --> 03:09:57,034
LAURA: Okay, okay. Shit.

2613
03:09:57,034 --> 03:09:58,743
SAM: How do we get to land quickly?

2614
03:09:58,743 --> 03:10:02,303
LAURA: I can fly there on my broom, but I don't
fly very quickly.

2615
03:10:02,303 --> 03:10:04,788
TALIESIN: Are we close enough that one of her
arrows can make it?

2616
03:10:04,788 --> 03:10:08,979
MATT: No, you're about three minutes out now from
approaching it.

2617
03:10:08,979 --> 03:10:10,810
TRAVIS: The ship or the shore?

2618
03:10:10,810 --> 03:10:12,047
MATT: The ship.

2619
03:10:12,047 --> 03:10:18,859
SAM: We should split. Some should go to the beach,
some should continue with plan Drop Keyleth--

2620
03:10:18,859 --> 03:10:20,753
TRAVIS: I'm going to the beach. I can't, yeah.

2621
03:10:20,753 --> 03:10:22,432
SAM: How are you getting to the beach? You can't
fly.

2622
03:10:22,432 --> 03:10:24,107
TRAVIS: Oh.

2623
03:10:24,107 --> 03:10:27,048
TALIESIN: Once we're close enough, you can port
them down.

2624
03:10:27,048 --> 03:10:30,266
SAM: I can make you a thing that flies, to get you
there.

2625
03:10:30,266 --> 03:10:31,651
TRAVIS: What kind of thing?

2626
03:10:31,651 --> 03:10:32,964
SAM: I don't know. Giant eagle?

2627
03:10:32,964 --> 03:10:36,105
TRAVIS: You worry about other stuff.

2628
03:10:36,105 --> 03:10:37,390
LAURA: A pterodactyl.

2629
03:10:37,390 --> 03:10:42,263
TRAVIS: That sounds like our only option, yeah.

2630
03:10:42,263 --> 03:10:46,196
LAURA: Three more minutes of scrying, still? Maybe
the scrying was ill-timed.

2631
03:10:46,196 --> 03:10:47,466
MATT: Two minutes.

2632
03:10:47,466 --> 03:10:50,177
SAM: All right, Grog. You and me. Come on, let's
go.

2633
03:10:50,177 --> 03:10:53,931
LAURA: Oh jeez. I ready the broom. I get on the
broom and wait.

2634
03:10:53,931 --> 03:10:57,670
TALIESIN: Prepare, I'm telling the men, prepare
the harpoons. It may be a trap.

2635
03:10:57,670 --> 03:11:03,623
MATT: "Understood. Man the harpoons!" You see they
all run off to the various, the three different

2636
03:11:03,623 --> 03:11:06,788
dragon arbalist stations.

2637
03:11:06,788 --> 03:11:12,330
TALIESIN: Prepare for a hard turn to shore if they
begin to show any signs of magical attack.

2638
03:11:12,330 --> 03:11:18,288
MATT: "Understood." You can now see the captain's
gone into war mode now. He's keeping focus forward

2639
03:11:18,288 --> 03:11:20,012
as he's pushing the ship.

2640
03:11:20,012 --> 03:11:23,348
TRAVIS: How do we communicate with the captain
once we're off the ship? Should we give him an

2641
03:11:23,348 --> 03:11:24,419
earring?

2642
03:11:24,419 --> 03:11:31,939
SAM: It won't reach, it's too far. Grog, I can
make you a thing that flies. Should I? All right,

2643
03:11:31,939 --> 03:11:38,653
I make him a giant eagle using Polymorph. I can't
do it to me, though, so you're on your own.

2644
03:11:38,653 --> 03:11:39,866
LAURA: Well you can hop on his back.

2645
03:11:39,866 --> 03:11:41,294
SAM: Oh yeah, good call!

2646
03:11:41,294 --> 03:11:43,026
TRAVIS: I'm a big-ass eagle.

2647
03:11:43,026 --> 03:11:50,228
MATT: Second time. Now the wings flare out, and
you remember, oh, flying! I'm smarter! Your

2648
03:11:50,228 --> 03:11:55,876
Flowers for Algernon moment comes in the form of a
feathered bird.

2649
03:11:55,876 --> 03:11:58,164
LIAM: a^2 + b^2 = c^2.

2650
03:11:58,164 --> 03:11:59,948
TRAVIS: No it doesn't.

2651
03:11:59,948 --> 03:12:04,818
MATT: Scanlan, you have to rush to get there
because he's almost completely taken aback by the

2652
03:12:04,818 --> 03:12:11,839
moment and goes to fly. You catch him, barely, as
he leaps off the side of the ship. You guys head

2653
03:12:11,839 --> 03:12:12,996
off toward the--

2654
03:12:12,996 --> 03:12:14,223
TRAVIS: In a wide arc.

2655
03:12:14,223 --> 03:12:19,457
TALIESIN: I tell the captain, no matter what
happens, use your judgment with any man or sailor

2656
03:12:19,457 --> 03:12:24,074
who wishes to parlay and come aboard, but if any
woman attempts to come on board you do not

2657
03:12:24,074 --> 03:12:26,669
recognize as one of us, kill her. Kill her
immediately.

2658
03:12:26,669 --> 03:12:29,650
TRAVIS: What if she's looking like nothing but
a--

2659
03:12:29,650 --> 03:12:32,665
LAURA: Anybody that comes on board, lock them up.
Immediately.

2660
03:12:32,665 --> 03:12:34,042
TALIESIN: At the very least.

2661
03:12:34,042 --> 03:12:35,791
SAM: And kill them.

2662
03:12:35,791 --> 03:12:37,521
TALIESIN: Check for a fake arm, and remove it.

2663
03:12:37,521 --> 03:12:38,816
MATT: "Loud and clear."

2664
03:12:38,816 --> 03:12:43,416
LAURA: I tell Trinket to hop in the necklace
because we're going to be traveling very quickly, dear.

2665
03:12:43,416 --> 03:12:45,199
MATT: Into the necklace.

2666
03:12:45,199 --> 03:12:52,151
TALIESIN: I'm trying to use the scope on my big,
on Bad News to see if anything interesting is

2667
03:12:52,151 --> 03:12:55,658
happening on the deck. Can I see the person who
was firing the flares?

2668
03:12:55,658 --> 03:12:59,718
MATT: The person that's now fired three flares is
now running below the deck.

2669
03:12:59,718 --> 03:13:03,696
TALIESIN: All right. They're all below the deck?

2670
03:13:03,696 --> 03:13:06,689
MATT: Seemingly everybody is below the deck right
now, yes.

2671
03:13:06,689 --> 03:13:10,089
TALIESIN: It's a trap. Let's move away from the
ship. Move toward the beach.

2672
03:13:10,089 --> 03:13:12,697
SAM: But we've got to sink the ship.

2673
03:13:12,697 --> 03:13:14,765
TALIESIN: We're going to sink this ship from a
distance.

2674
03:13:14,765 --> 03:13:17,074
LAURA: She's still scrying. We can, they might be
by the ship.

2675
03:13:17,074 --> 03:13:18,571
TALIESIN: I tell them to turn. Turn now!

2676
03:13:18,571 --> 03:13:20,522
MATT: "Aye, aye!"

2677
03:13:20,522 --> 03:13:23,699
LAURA: I shoot the arrow and try to get to the
boat. The oracle arrow.

2678
03:13:23,699 --> 03:13:29,051
MATT: The ship suddenly begins to list very
heavily to the left side. All the hands grab hold

2679
03:13:29,051 --> 03:13:34,094
who are currently stationed at the various
elements. You can see things on the deck, ropes

2680
03:13:34,094 --> 03:13:38,905
and various odds and ends, pieces of metal, coins,
all begin drifting to one side, some tumbling over

2681
03:13:38,905 --> 03:13:45,699
into the ocean below. You all hold on tight as you
pull around the side. Keyleth, I need you to make

2682
03:13:45,699 --> 03:13:46,921
a concentration check.

2683
03:13:46,921 --> 03:13:49,137
LAURA: Oh, come on!

2684
03:13:49,137 --> 03:13:57,847
MATT: I'm giving you advantage because it isn't a
huge issue. Constitution saving throw.

2685
03:13:57,847 --> 03:14:02,390
SAM: What are they going to do? They don't have
anything that can fight us. They're deck hands.

2686
03:14:02,390 --> 03:14:08,561
TALIESIN: Why are they down below? There's no
hiding in the middle of the ocean. That's a death

2687
03:14:08,561 --> 03:14:09,561
sentence.

2688
03:14:09,561 --> 03:14:10,671
MARISHA: Okay, 13.

2689
03:14:10,671 --> 03:14:15,453
MATT: You're fine. As it's turning, all of a
sudden your eyes flare open with vision. So this

2690
03:14:15,453 --> 03:14:18,183
is not with the journal, correct?

2691
03:14:18,183 --> 03:14:21,259
TALIESIN: She's still got my gun.

2692
03:14:21,259 --> 03:14:33,908
MATT: So what's your spell DC? 19 plus, okay. As
the ship lists, your vision flashes and, for a

2693
03:14:33,908 --> 03:14:40,990
second, your vision focuses on Ripley's face. You
see a spark of blue energy, similar to the inside

2694
03:14:40,990 --> 03:14:45,653
of the cloak that you saw the first time with your
vision. The spell kicks out.

2695
03:14:45,653 --> 03:14:47,661
MARISHA: Son of a bitch!

2696
03:14:47,661 --> 03:14:51,864
LAURA: Was it underwater? Can you at least tell
that much?

2697
03:14:51,864 --> 03:14:53,064
MATT: No.

2698
03:14:53,064 --> 03:14:56,118
LAURA: Fuck. Good times.

2699
03:14:56,118 --> 03:14:57,828
MATT: You find yourself sliding.

2700
03:14:57,828 --> 03:15:00,583
LIAM: Are we above the ship at the moment?

2701
03:15:00,583 --> 03:15:02,610
MARISHA: I grab Vax for safety.

2702
03:15:02,610 --> 03:15:10,059
MATT: All right, you guys hold on. The ship turns,
a very quick turn, heading toward the shore.

2703
03:15:10,059 --> 03:15:17,670
TALIESIN: We are, we've got two fliers. I'm going
to, I think it's time, we're going to attack them

2704
03:15:17,670 --> 03:15:20,195
if we can with the bolts. If that's possible.

2705
03:15:20,195 --> 03:15:21,968
MATT: If you give them the order, they will.

2706
03:15:21,968 --> 03:15:24,128
MARISHA: Percy, I can destroy that ship if we get
over it.

2707
03:15:24,128 --> 03:15:26,117
LIAM: I think we should still go.

2708
03:15:26,117 --> 03:15:28,148
MATT: "Are we firing? What do you need?''

2709
03:15:28,148 --> 03:15:29,516
LIAM: Keyleth, you ready? Let's go.

2710
03:15:29,516 --> 03:15:30,595
TALIESIN: Let's fire.

2711
03:15:30,595 --> 03:15:32,615
MARISHA: I go with Vax.

2712
03:15:32,615 --> 03:15:36,030
TALIESIN: They're going to go. I'm going to fire
on the ship. Fire on the ship!

2713
03:15:36,030 --> 03:15:40,462
MATT: "Fire!" He yells out. You watch as the
arbalists all pull back, (arrows releasing). As

2714
03:15:40,462 --> 03:15:47,418
they release it, they have these giant, hard, dark
iron bolts that are loaded into these. As they

2715
03:15:47,418 --> 03:15:52,140
release them, they go traveling through the
dragon's mouth. The dragon's mouth bursts into

2716
03:15:52,140 --> 03:16:00,091
flame and lights the bolts into arcane fire. All
launch off and arc downward. One of them misses,

2717
03:16:00,091 --> 03:16:05,148
(splashing) into the water, but two go slamming
into the side of the ship. You see wood

2718
03:16:05,148 --> 03:16:10,313
splintering. You see flames begin to crawl along
the side while both of you, what are you doing?

2719
03:16:10,313 --> 03:16:13,054
MARISHA: I'm holding on to him, piggyback ride
style.

2720
03:16:13,054 --> 03:16:17,363
LIAM: I'm on your back, or piggyback? Aren't you
going earth elemental?

2721
03:16:17,363 --> 03:16:20,559
MARISHA: I got to get over the ship. I can't fly
as an earth elemental!

2722
03:16:20,559 --> 03:16:21,960
LIAM: Here we go!

2723
03:16:21,960 --> 03:16:27,017
MATT: All right, as she's saying this, you leap
off, wings go out, coasting down over the ship. You

2724
03:16:27,017 --> 03:16:31,185
begin to glide under as you can see the
explosions. They begin loading up the second round

2725
03:16:31,185 --> 03:16:36,352
of assault on the ship. You arc around, keeping
her on your back. You guys are coming down toward

2726
03:16:36,352 --> 03:16:41,537
the ship. You now watch as another volley, two
miss but a third one hits. Another splinter of

2727
03:16:41,537 --> 03:16:44,160
various pieces of the ship bow torn asunder.

2728
03:16:44,160 --> 03:16:46,954
MARISHA: I wait until he gets me over top of the
boat. As soon as he gets me over top.

2729
03:16:46,954 --> 03:16:51,866
MATT: You coast up on the side. You watch as one
of the three large masts begins to slowly fall

2730
03:16:51,866 --> 03:16:58,616
over from the impact of the various assaults from
the ship. You are now up over the ship itself.

2731
03:16:58,616 --> 03:16:59,837
LIAM: You ready to do this?

2732
03:16:59,837 --> 03:17:00,987
MARISHA: Nice and high, nice and high!

2733
03:17:00,987 --> 03:17:02,602
LIAM: All right, we're going to twist in the air!
Here we go!

2734
03:17:02,602 --> 03:17:07,176
MATT: As this is happening, you see one of them
has come over from inside of the ship and is

2735
03:17:07,176 --> 03:17:12,379
watching this attack happen. You can barely see,
he looks harried but he looks up and releases.

2736
03:17:12,379 --> 03:17:16,115
MARISHA: I let go. We're over the boat?

2737
03:17:16,115 --> 03:17:18,035
MATT: You guys are over the boat now, yes.

2738
03:17:18,035 --> 03:17:20,521
TALIESIN: Is there any way I could have gotten any
of this in my scope?

2739
03:17:20,521 --> 03:17:24,359
MATT: You know what, yes. Well make a perception
check first, actually, to see if you've seen this.

2740
03:17:24,359 --> 03:17:28,969
LIAM: As we're twisting in the air, I cast Bless
on Keyleth and myself.

2741
03:17:28,969 --> 03:17:38,153
MATT: Make a concentration check because you are
flying. A constitution saving throw.

2742
03:17:38,153 --> 03:17:45,565
LIAM: 18. That means that you and I, whenever we
make an attack roll or a saving throw for the next

2743
03:17:45,565 --> 03:17:47,205
minute, add a d4.

2744
03:17:47,205 --> 03:17:49,811
TALIESIN: 14.

2745
03:17:49,811 --> 03:17:56,176
MATT: 14? You can make the attack. It'll be at
disadvantage because of the distance. This is with

2746
03:17:56,176 --> 03:17:57,250
Bad News, I assume?

2747
03:17:57,250 --> 03:17:58,405
TALIESIN: Yes.

2748
03:17:58,405 --> 03:18:01,732
MATT: So disadvantage on the attack. Are you using
any grit or anything?

2749
03:18:01,732 --> 03:18:18,430
TALIESIN: Not cool! I'm already shaky today. Yeah,
you know what, I'll use a grit to deadeye the

2750
03:18:18,430 --> 03:18:20,305
shot, to cancel out the disadvantage.

2751
03:18:20,305 --> 03:18:22,299
MATT: All right, go ahead and make your roll.

2752
03:18:22,299 --> 03:18:24,526
LAURA: Who are you shooting?

2753
03:18:24,526 --> 03:18:27,015
SAM: The guy on deck who just went like this.

2754
03:18:27,015 --> 03:18:28,775
LAURA: Oh, I thought he already ran under.

2755
03:18:28,775 --> 03:18:34,341
MATT: No, he came up onto the deck to do
something. He barely saw, and he's taking a shot.

2756
03:18:34,341 --> 03:18:37,228
TALIESIN: That's not bad. 24.

2757
03:18:37,228 --> 03:18:38,918
MATT: 24 hits. Go ahead.

2758
03:18:38,918 --> 03:18:40,752
LIAM: Bullet cam!

2759
03:18:40,752 --> 03:18:53,354
TALIESIN: Let me find the correct dice for this.
23 points of piercing damage.

2760
03:18:53,354 --> 03:19:00,973
MATT: The individual reaches up and you see a
burst of electrical energy fire up in the

2761
03:19:00,973 --> 03:19:06,585
direction of both of you. Right as, head shot on
the side of the skull, sending him face down and

2762
03:19:06,585 --> 03:19:12,956
bleeding onto the now raging fire that is the top
of this ship. Both of you guys have advantage on a

2763
03:19:12,956 --> 03:19:14,318
dexterity saving throw.

2764
03:19:14,318 --> 03:19:17,195
MARISHA: Wait, what?

2765
03:19:17,195 --> 03:19:19,299
TALIESIN: He still got a shot off, but it went
wild.

2766
03:19:19,299 --> 03:19:21,718
MARISHA: Natural 20!

2767
03:19:21,718 --> 03:19:23,665
LIAM: And I have a 28.

2768
03:19:23,665 --> 03:19:32,921
MATT: All right. So both of you take 14 points of
lightning damage as the Lightning Bolt barely

2769
03:19:32,921 --> 03:19:38,821
skims past you. Vax, you, scooting off, your wings
burned by the electrical impact, but you're off to

2770
03:19:38,821 --> 03:19:41,156
the side. Keyleth, you're now in freefall over the
ship.

2771
03:19:41,156 --> 03:19:42,349
LIAM: Can I use evasion?

2772
03:19:42,349 --> 03:19:44,177
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

2773
03:19:44,177 --> 03:19:47,263
LIAM: So that's, if I succeed the dex, yeah, it's
every turn.

2774
03:19:47,263 --> 03:19:48,632
MATT: Seven.

2775
03:19:48,632 --> 03:19:49,817
LIAM: It halves it, right?

2776
03:19:49,817 --> 03:19:52,347
MATT: It was 14 because you made the save, and
then seven.

2777
03:19:52,347 --> 03:20:05,895
MARISHA: I blow Vax a kiss and then I go earth
elemental. I light up my flaming hands! And then I

2778
03:20:05,895 --> 03:20:07,251
go Keyteor.

2779
03:20:07,251 --> 03:20:09,488
LIAM: See you later!

2780
03:20:09,488 --> 03:20:17,735
MATT: Your Keyteor, as you coined it, is now this
ball of condensed rock, a trail of flame behind

2781
03:20:17,735 --> 03:20:25,803
it. (whistling) (crashing) Slams into the ship. I
want you to go ahead and roll 6d6 points of

2782
03:20:25,803 --> 03:20:28,740
damage. Plus a d4.

2783
03:20:28,740 --> 03:20:37,755
MARISHA: 6d6. There's got to be one more for this.
Don't fuck me.

2784
03:20:37,755 --> 03:20:43,730
LIAM: How do you even know which ones you rolled?
It looks like 80 dice.

2785
03:20:43,730 --> 03:21:03,940
MARISHA: Well all of them. 21. Plus one. Oh wait.
22, plus do I roll my flame hands?

2786
03:21:03,940 --> 03:21:05,674
MATT: Yes, you do.

2787
03:21:05,840 --> 03:21:07,836
MARISHA: 27.

2788
03:21:07,836 --> 03:21:14,064
MATT: Boom! You punch through the upper deck of
the ship, smack through the central deck of the

2789
03:21:14,064 --> 03:21:20,419
ship, and slam into the base, splintering wood,
but the actual bottom of the ship is still intact.

2790
03:21:20,419 --> 03:21:25,528
However, from the impact and everything that's
going on, the flames trail through and begin to

2791
03:21:25,528 --> 03:21:32,048
burn. You see as, looking down at you, one of the
crewmen who was underneath is now a pulp beneath

2792
03:21:32,048 --> 03:21:38,248
your elemental feet. Another one is now scrambling
back up to the top amidst the chaos.

2793
03:21:38,248 --> 03:21:42,506
MARISHA: I get up and I say: Sorry!

2794
03:21:42,506 --> 03:21:48,244
MATT: As you pull your foot out, water begins to
pour inside. Apparently your feet punched through,

2795
03:21:48,244 --> 03:21:53,521
and now it's beginning to quickly (splashing
sounds). Water's beginning to pour out of the

2796
03:21:53,521 --> 03:21:55,095
ocean and fill the bottom of the ship.

2797
03:21:55,095 --> 03:21:57,723
MARISHA: I tell the guys above: Swim to shore!

2798
03:21:57,723 --> 03:22:03,838
MATT: It sounds, (loud gravelly gibberish).
They're like (yelling).

2799
03:22:03,838 --> 03:22:11,911
LAURA: While this is happening, can I have taken a
flying run off of the airship and started flying

2800
03:22:11,911 --> 03:22:13,653
toward the smoke? The campfire?

2801
03:22:13,653 --> 03:22:21,319
MATT: You dart off with the broom underneath and
scoot off toward the bay. You guys have made your

2802
03:22:21,319 --> 03:22:29,550
way, flying down, on eagle-Grog-back to the beach,
coasting up to the side. You can see, as you scoot

2803
03:22:29,550 --> 03:22:34,615
across to the top about ten feet up, all the
jagged, broken glass that is this beach. It is

2804
03:22:34,615 --> 03:22:44,030
similar to the broken, burnt ground of the
Cindergrove, except it's all sharp. It's not fun.

2805
03:22:44,030 --> 03:22:50,850
You come around and make a perception check, Grog.
With your bonus. I think you have advantage on

2806
03:22:50,850 --> 03:22:55,811
this because you're a giant eagle. Let me double
check really fast. I'm pretty sure. Giant eagle,

2807
03:22:55,811 --> 03:22:58,562
you have advantage on perception checks, so yeah,
roll twice.

2808
03:22:58,562 --> 03:23:02,202
TRAVIS: Same number. And do I get a bonus on
the--

2809
03:23:02,202 --> 03:23:03,769
MATT: Well, your wisdom is plus two.

2810
03:23:03,769 --> 03:23:05,291
TRAVIS: 15.

2811
03:23:05,291 --> 03:23:12,919
MATT: 15. As you're coming along, you do see,
there appears to be some semblance of a smoldering

2812
03:23:12,919 --> 03:23:18,739
fire that is giving off a hint of a trail of
smoke. There's a couple of things on the ground

2813
03:23:18,739 --> 03:23:26,164
around it, and there are two small boats that are
up against, up on the shore. They look like little

2814
03:23:26,164 --> 03:23:29,510
skiffs or paddle boats that probably belong to the
ship.

2815
03:23:29,510 --> 03:23:39,484
TRAVIS: I fly over. I'm going to make a low buzz
over the campfire, but keep going along the beach.

2816
03:23:39,484 --> 03:23:41,859
Not landing at the boat or the fire.

2817
03:23:41,859 --> 03:23:48,249
MATT: You keep going. Vex, you see the eagle swoop
past with Scanlan on the back. Are you heading to

2818
03:23:48,249 --> 03:23:49,321
catch up with them?

2819
03:23:49,321 --> 03:23:50,281
LAURA: Yeah.

2820
03:23:50,281 --> 03:23:52,920
MATT: Okay, so you guys have Vex coming and
meeting up alongside you guys now, as you're

2821
03:23:52,920 --> 03:23:59,516
flying and coasting. From the side, you see this
broom-riding Vex lean forward, go over and give

2822
03:23:59,516 --> 03:24:04,710
you a wink from the side as you begin heading
along the upper coast, the curvature of the beach,

2823
03:24:04,710 --> 03:24:06,211
heading towards the east.

2824
03:24:06,211 --> 03:24:12,717
TALIESIN: Vax, Keyleth, search the ship. Take
anything you think might be hers.

2825
03:24:12,717 --> 03:24:15,936
LIAM: How far am I from Percival on the airship?

2826
03:24:15,936 --> 03:24:20,962
MATT: You've probably looped around, and you're
probably halfway between the ship, which is now

2827
03:24:20,962 --> 03:24:26,336
heading back toward the shore, and the boat on the
ground that is now, both masts are now in complete

2828
03:24:26,336 --> 03:24:34,536
flames. The sail is on fire. Two of the crewmen,
the two crewmen who haven't really been hurt

2829
03:24:34,536 --> 03:24:38,863
have jumped off the sides and are now swimming
through the water. You can see their trail behind

2830
03:24:38,863 --> 03:24:46,575
them. The one who was shot in the head, you can't
see through the flames. It wasn't enough to kill

2831
03:24:46,575 --> 03:24:51,467
him, that wasn't. However, the whole ship is on
fire now. The one that you impacted with is a

2832
03:24:51,467 --> 03:24:53,469
mess, Keyleth.

2833
03:24:53,469 --> 03:24:55,839
LIAM: Then I'm beelining straight through the air
towards Percival.

2834
03:24:55,839 --> 03:24:58,071
TALIESIN: Stay with Keyleth! Check the ship!

2835
03:24:58,071 --> 03:25:00,064
MARISHA: I crush everything.

2836
03:25:00,064 --> 03:25:02,102
TALIESIN: Search the ship, Keyleth. Search it.

2837
03:25:02,102 --> 03:25:03,290
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2838
03:25:03,290 --> 03:25:04,285
MARISHA: Me?

2839
03:25:04,285 --> 03:25:08,245
MATT: Yeah. You can still hear him, he's telling
you this through your earring.

2840
03:25:08,245 --> 03:25:13,900
TALIESIN: Take the captain's quarters. You can
breathe underwater. Tear it apart as it's going down.

2841
03:25:13,900 --> 03:25:19,461
MATT: As an earth elemental, roll an investigation
minus three because your intelligence is five. You

2842
03:25:19,461 --> 03:25:23,840
are dumber than Grog as an earth elemental.

2843
03:25:23,840 --> 03:25:32,687
MARISHA: Natural 20! There's no reason that should
have happened!

2844
03:25:32,687 --> 03:25:42,803
MATT: I agree! As water is filling the bottom, and
you're not very good at treading water in this

2845
03:25:42,803 --> 03:25:49,364
form. You're sinking with the ship pretty much.
It's (burbling noises). Thankfully you can breathe

2846
03:25:49,364 --> 03:25:54,482
water because you still have the enchantment on
you. Glancing around, you do see what amounts to a

2847
03:25:54,482 --> 03:26:01,714
bunch of notes, papers, that are all soaked in
water, that you palm with your elemental hand. And

2848
03:26:01,714 --> 03:26:06,009
you keep it there, grab a couple, and you now have
two fists filled with papers. You don't know what

2849
03:26:06,009 --> 03:26:12,777
they are or what's on them. You can't even read in
this form, technically, but you're now underwater

2850
03:26:12,777 --> 03:26:17,770
and the ship is breaking and falling. You can
watch as the flames above, the glow is growing

2851
03:26:17,770 --> 03:26:23,448
dimmer as the water is beginning to take the fire.
It's slowly falling into the bay.

2852
03:26:23,448 --> 03:26:27,450
TALIESIN: Start walking to the beach, Keyleth. Get
to the beach.

2853
03:26:27,450 --> 03:26:37,903
MARISHA: Yeah, I guess I start toward the beach.
Well that's going to take a long time. The ship is

2854
03:26:37,903 --> 03:26:39,163
sinking, right?

2855
03:26:39,163 --> 03:26:45,799
MATT: Yeah, you're probably, now, the ship is
probably 30 feet below the surface and falling,

2856
03:26:45,799 --> 03:26:47,004
you with it.

2857
03:26:47,004 --> 03:26:48,426
MARISHA: I'm going to drop my form.

2858
03:26:48,426 --> 03:26:53,077
MATT: Okay, you're back into Keyleth form and
immediately the lack of mass, the ship begins to

2859
03:26:53,077 --> 03:27:01,829
fall below you as you keep buoyancy now. The hole
that you broke through is now this opening that

2860
03:27:01,829 --> 03:27:04,164
you can swim up to get out of the wreckage of the
ship.

2861
03:27:04,164 --> 03:27:08,510
MARISHA: Okay, I take all the papers and I shove
them in a pocket, and I'm going to cast Control

2862
03:27:08,510 --> 03:27:11,402
Water. I'm going to shoot myself up and out.

2863
03:27:11,402 --> 03:27:17,607
MATT: Like a waterspout. You watch as Keyleth is
jettisoned out of the ocean and then begins to

2864
03:27:17,607 --> 03:27:21,704
lightly surf along the surface, standing.

2865
03:27:21,704 --> 03:27:24,190
LAURA: Percy!

2866
03:27:24,190 --> 03:27:25,314
TALIESIN: Yes.

2867
03:27:25,314 --> 03:27:30,329
LAURA: Make sure the airship stays far away from
these boats. I don't want Ripley having any access

2868
03:27:30,329 --> 03:27:31,745
to the airship.

2869
03:27:31,745 --> 03:27:38,762
SAM: On the beach, we're going around, along the
beach. Is there a tree line?

2870
03:27:38,762 --> 03:27:50,151
MATT: The tree line is further inland, maybe about
300 feet inland? Most of the open glass shore is

2871
03:27:50,151 --> 03:27:54,075
on the eastern and southern side. On the north and
northwestern side is where the mountain is, and

2872
03:27:54,075 --> 03:27:57,693
the jungle surrounds most of the mountain, and a
lot of the western side of the island.

2873
03:27:57,693 --> 03:28:03,305
SAM: I shout down to Grog: I don't think she's on
the beach, man! It's all glass! We should go

2874
03:28:03,305 --> 03:28:04,451
inland.

2875
03:28:04,451 --> 03:28:05,881
TRAVIS: We turn inland.

2876
03:28:05,881 --> 03:28:08,337
MATT: Okay, you guys go ahead and take off
inland.

2877
03:28:08,337 --> 03:28:09,809
LIAM: Am I closing on Percy?

2878
03:28:09,809 --> 03:28:14,709
MATT: You're making your way toward the ship,
yeah. The ship is faster than you.

2879
03:28:14,709 --> 03:28:16,069
LIAM: Oh really?

2880
03:28:16,069 --> 03:28:17,103
MATT: Yes.

2881
03:28:17,103 --> 03:28:19,732
LIAM: I click my boots of haste, then. I can go
500 feet in a round.

2882
03:28:19,732 --> 03:28:21,910
MATT: 500 feet?

2883
03:28:21,910 --> 03:28:27,144
LIAM: 480, yeah. If I use double dash, yeah,
action action.

2884
03:28:27,144 --> 03:28:28,918
MATT: Well your flying speed is, what, 60?

2885
03:28:28,918 --> 03:28:36,435
LIAM: I mean, I did the math at one point. I know
it's 480 feet. My speed, flying, is 60.

2886
03:28:36,435 --> 03:28:38,497
MATT: You can dash as a bonus action, right?

2887
03:28:38,497 --> 03:28:43,855
LIAM: As a bonus action, yeah, but if I'm hasted,
it's doubled. So it's 60, it's 120, action,

2888
03:28:43,855 --> 03:28:53,764
action, bonus action, so 120 plus 120, and then
bonus action, I can also dash. I don't know.

2889
03:28:53,764 --> 03:28:58,879
MATT: You can catch up to the ship with haste,
yes. So you click your boots of haste and all of a

2890
03:28:58,879 --> 03:29:06,832
sudden, your wings, the feathers themselves almost
thin out, they retract in. You become less of a

2891
03:29:06,832 --> 03:29:13,218
bird and more of a bullet, coasting forward at a
downward arc. You eventually catch up to the back

2892
03:29:13,218 --> 03:29:21,728
outer side of the airship as it's bearing down on
the smoke spiral and the innermost part of the bay

2893
03:29:21,728 --> 03:29:22,899
beach line.

2894
03:29:22,899 --> 03:29:28,143
LIAM: I'm going to pick you up, you haughty prick!
And I reach out my arms and grab him from behind.

2895
03:29:28,143 --> 03:29:33,215
MATT: Okay. You almost drop Bad News at the sudden
impact, but you grab it and hold on to it as

2896
03:29:33,215 --> 03:29:42,183
you're lifted up again over the air. Another
uncomfortable height experience. You've had a

2897
03:29:42,183 --> 03:29:46,802
couple of these recently. But it's swift enough to
the point, and not prolonged, to the point where

2898
03:29:46,802 --> 03:29:50,128
you're able to keep yourself in check. You begin
to carry him down--

2899
03:29:50,128 --> 03:29:52,119
LIAM: Barrel roll, and follow my sister.

2900
03:29:52,119 --> 03:29:59,247
MATT: Okay, so now all of you guys are this loose
squadron along the beach line. As you watch, they

2901
03:29:59,247 --> 03:30:02,236
turn off and begin to head toward the tree line.

2902
03:30:02,236 --> 03:30:04,917
LAURA: Can I get a closer look at the campsite?

2903
03:30:04,917 --> 03:30:08,486
MATT: You'd probably have to stop and inspect it
if you want.

2904
03:30:08,486 --> 03:30:11,795
LAURA: Is there anybody that I can see around it
from above?

2905
03:30:11,795 --> 03:30:15,139
MATT: Make a perception check.

2906
03:30:15,139 --> 03:30:18,759
LAURA: Yes, 30, then.

2907
03:30:18,759 --> 03:30:26,160
MATT: From what you can see, the campsite, the
fire has the smoldering element that, from your

2908
03:30:26,160 --> 03:30:30,635
experience with campfires, means it's probably
been burning for anywhere from four to five hours

2909
03:30:30,635 --> 03:30:34,741
and is towards the end of its life. Whatever wood
was in there is on the very very last cinders.

2910
03:30:34,741 --> 03:30:41,893
There appear to be some elements in detail, some
heavy movement right around it in the shoreline

2911
03:30:41,893 --> 03:30:47,811
there. There's a little bit of silt that has
washed up onto the glass, so right next to the

2912
03:30:47,811 --> 03:30:54,794
waterline there is still a meeting of underwater
dirt and silt and where the glass begins to take

2913
03:30:54,794 --> 03:31:00,823
over. And you can see a bunch of shifting in that
area, but you're too far away to make out any

2914
03:31:00,823 --> 03:31:06,664
details. But other than that, you don't see any
hint of people or life around that site.

2915
03:31:06,664 --> 03:31:13,106
TRAVIS: Can Scanlan and I make a loop heading
towards the tree line and then stop, I'd say, 100

2916
03:31:13,106 --> 03:31:15,504
feet from where the water hits the shore?

2917
03:31:15,504 --> 03:31:19,669
MATT: Okay, so you head to the tree line and then
you stop about 100 feet out, about halfway between

2918
03:31:19,669 --> 03:31:21,098
the shore and the tree line?

2919
03:31:21,098 --> 03:31:22,210
TRAVIS: Right, yeah, not all the way.

2920
03:31:22,210 --> 03:31:28,608
MATT: You hit there and you end up stopping,
(whooshing) land, and you land in the one area

2921
03:31:28,608 --> 03:31:36,120
where it appears the least painful to land on.
Now, for all intents and purposes, this entire

2922
03:31:36,120 --> 03:31:39,935
landscape is considered rough terrain, so your
speed is halved. You can run full speed if you

2923
03:31:39,935 --> 03:31:41,885
want, but you will take damage in doing so.

2924
03:31:41,885 --> 03:31:43,515
LIAM: Ugh, Lego, it's all made of little Legos!

2925
03:31:43,515 --> 03:31:48,781
MATT: Kind of, yeah. So you land. Scanlan, you're
on the back of Grog and you're now standing in the

2926
03:31:48,781 --> 03:31:51,428
center of this open beach area.

2927
03:31:51,428 --> 03:31:55,163
SAM: I'm scanning around for any footprints or
anything.

2928
03:31:55,163 --> 03:31:56,778
TRAVIS: As he's scanning, I peck him in the
shoulder.

2929
03:31:56,778 --> 03:31:58,243
SAM: Ow, ow! Fuck, ow!

2930
03:31:58,243 --> 03:32:02,109
MARISHA: So we've all convened on the shore at
this point?

2931
03:32:02,109 --> 03:32:08,428
MATT: You see them land a little ways up from the
shore. Vex, are you landing with them?

2932
03:32:08,428 --> 03:32:12,457
LAURA: No, I wanted to fly down a little closer
and see if I can see any footprints, and see where

2933
03:32:12,457 --> 03:32:13,383
they lead.

2934
03:32:13,383 --> 03:32:16,211
MATT: Okay, so you watch Vex spiral off and head
to the actual campsite at the edge of the beach.

2935
03:32:16,211 --> 03:32:19,215
What are you two doing?

2936
03:32:19,215 --> 03:32:20,446
TALIESIN: Keyleth, can you meet up with us?

2937
03:32:20,446 --> 03:32:23,229
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm meeting up with them on the
shore I guess.

2938
03:32:23,229 --> 03:32:25,590
LIAM: I'm a Vax backpack, so we'll just--

2939
03:32:25,590 --> 03:32:27,353
TALIESIN: At the campfire.

2940
03:32:27,353 --> 03:32:34,276
MATT: So you guys (whooshing) come down and land
at the campfire as you watch Keyleth water-skiing

2941
03:32:34,276 --> 03:32:40,831
right up to the edge of the beach, where, as soon
as the water ends, you have to catch yourself, but

2942
03:32:40,831 --> 03:32:50,022
you catch yourself. As you now stand here at the
beach, the little hint of the flaming wreckage of

2943
03:32:50,022 --> 03:32:57,306
the ship in the distance finally sinking below the
surface of the water; the gallant eagle, Grog,

2944
03:32:57,306 --> 03:33:04,412
standing off a little ways, with Scanlan Shorthalt
raising a fist to the air; we're going to end our

2945
03:33:04,412 --> 03:33:09,348
session for today. Give us some fun to explore
next episode.

2946
03:33:09,348 --> 03:33:11,757
MARISHA: But there was so much more to do!

2947
03:33:11,757 --> 03:33:17,075
TALIESIN: I am having such a Robert Louis
Stevenson moment right now. I'm so excited.

2948
03:33:17,075 --> 03:33:18,711
SAM: We finished before eleven!

2949
03:33:18,711 --> 03:33:19,987
TALIESIN: No we did not!

2950
03:33:19,987 --> 03:33:24,329
MATT: Yes we did! I intended that because we've
gone long a lot of weeks!

2951
03:33:24,329 --> 03:33:29,579
TALIESIN: I cannot imagine that I might actually
get four hours of sleep tonight. That's amazing.

2952
03:33:29,579 --> 03:33:37,528
MATT: I'm going to write more campaign setting.
Guys, awesome episode, well done.

2953
03:33:37,528 --> 03:33:39,196
LIAM: That was a great game, Matt.

2954
03:33:39,196 --> 03:33:41,302
MATT: Good stuff, guys.

2955
03:33:41,302 --> 03:33:43,810
TRAVIS: Thank you to our sponsor, Backblaze!

2956
03:33:43,810 --> 03:33:48,362
SAM: Did they run a commercial during the break?

2957
03:33:48,362 --> 03:33:50,910
LAURA: I hope so, because I love those
commercials.

2958
03:33:50,910 --> 03:33:55,487
TRAVIS: Those commercials are fucking hilarious.

2959
03:33:55,487 --> 03:34:01,119
MATT: All right, guys, well, thank you very much,
rest well, you guys as well. Thank you so much for

2960
03:34:01,119 --> 03:34:04,107
all your awesome support in watching the show. We
appreciate everything, and--

2961
03:34:04,107 --> 03:34:08,570
TRAVIS: And next Thursday you can see us at Game
the Game the hour beforehand.

2962
03:34:08,570 --> 03:34:15,905
MATT: Game the Game, 5:30 to 6:30, going into our
next episode of Critical Role and have a good

2963
03:34:15,905 --> 03:34:18,282
night. Is it Thursday yet?

2964
03:34:18,282 --> 03:43:09,081
