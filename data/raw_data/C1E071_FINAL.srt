00:00:00,097 --> 00:00:03,045
MATT: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

2
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:08,383
sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons!
Tonight's going to be an interesting episode, but

3
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:12,023
before we get to that, a couple of quick
announcements and a couple of cool things we wanted

4
00:00:12,023 --> 00:00:17,596
to show you. One, our friend of the show, Kiki,
who we saw previously made the awesome Fenthras

5
00:00:17,596 --> 00:00:25,132
bow replica for Laura over there recently decided
to go ahead and also create Cabal's Ruin.

6
00:00:25,132 --> 00:00:30,270
Taliesin, do you want to come over here and try
this on?

7
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,086
TALIESIN: No, I'm getting into that.

8
00:00:32,086 --> 00:00:34,240
MARISHA: It is on your body.

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,942
MATT: Come attune to this shit, boy!

10
00:00:36,942 --> 00:00:39,631
MARISHA: Go sit in the corner with it for 30
minutes.

11
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:49,813
LIAM: Put it on. Oh my god.

12
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:52,289
TRAVIS: Stand in front of this table. Stand in
front of this camera.

13
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:59,127
No one can see you over there. Why are you
getting totally naked?

14
00:00:59,197 --> 00:01:01,820
LIAM: It looks just like Tom Cruise's!

15
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,624
TRAVIS: Stand over here!

16
00:01:04,624 --> 00:01:05,801
MATT: Go over there.

17
00:01:05,801 --> 00:01:06,932
TALIESIN: Where?

18
00:01:06,932 --> 00:01:10,886
TRAVIS: In front of the table, you dicklord! Yes!

19
00:01:10,886 --> 00:01:12,883
SAM: Someone get a camera on this guy.

20
00:01:12,883 --> 00:01:14,921
TALIESIN: I don't know which camera is--

21
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:23,413
TRAVIS: Put your butt against this table! Kneel
down, Taliesin!

22
00:01:23,413 --> 00:01:28,099
MARISHA: Taliesin, you work in film and TV. You
know how this works! Get behind where we are.

23
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:30,934
LAURA: No, he wants to be right there.

24
00:01:30,934 --> 00:01:34,748
TALIESIN: I know. (laughs)

25
00:01:34,748 --> 00:01:36,775
LIAM: Oh my goodness.

26
00:01:36,775 --> 00:01:40,570
TALIESIN: Our plan's going to go so
well.

27
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:51,387
MATT: And she also made a fantastic replica of
Whisper, the blade that was previously attuned by

28
00:01:51,387 --> 00:01:53,986
our dear rogue. Will you pass that over to Liam?

29
00:01:53,986 --> 00:01:58,127
TRAVIS: And will you hold up that mini?

30
00:01:58,127 --> 00:02:01,732
LAURA: You get to have that because you took two
Vestiges.

31
00:02:01,732 --> 00:02:09,353
TRAVIS: This amazing mini was done by Eric
Blumkiss-- I'm sure I'm messing up the name-- from

32
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:14,136
Sweden. It's an incredible Grog mini that's so
detailed and amazing, and I had to have it, so I

33
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:16,036
promised our firstborn child to him.

34
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,617
LAURA: Oh, good times.

35
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:25,932
MATT: That might make an appearance tonight as a
proxy Grog for battle.

36
00:02:25,932 --> 00:02:28,943
TALIESIN: I would break everything on the way back
here.

37
00:02:28,943 --> 00:02:31,793
MATT: And also, since it was recently Sam's
birthday.

38
00:02:31,793 --> 00:02:37,735
SAM: What? A present for me? On stream?

39
00:02:37,735 --> 00:02:40,003
MATT: It's from me and Marisha.

40
00:02:40,003 --> 00:02:42,594
TALIESIN: Happy pineapple day.

41
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:52,630
SAM: Oh, this is so exciting. What did I get? It's
a great gift! Shirt-ception!

42
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,278
MARISHA: Yay!

43
00:02:54,278 --> 00:02:55,846
SAM: Part four!

44
00:02:55,846 --> 00:02:58,168
MARISHA: Must keep it going!

45
00:02:58,168 --> 00:03:07,044
SAM: (yells) Oh man! This is the best gift! It's
the gift that keeps giving.

46
00:03:07,044 --> 00:03:11,134
TRAVIS: The four of them stacked are pretty
fucking incredible.

47
00:03:11,134 --> 00:03:13,479
MARISHA: I know, I think you've aged through the
process.

48
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:21,413
SAM: Yeah. I'm going to take a picture of me.
Someone can put that on a shirt. Oh man, this is

49
00:03:21,413 --> 00:03:22,473
amazing.

50
00:03:22,473 --> 00:03:27,201
MATT: We are slowly folding into infinity. Sam's
shirts will be the end of all existence.

51
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:30,433
SAM: That's so great. That's my favorite gift I've
ever gotten.

52
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:35,065
LIAM: That's what's inside the black spinning marble
underneath Whitestone.

53
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:40,785
SAM: Oh man. Thank you, guys. That's so sweet.

54
00:03:40,785 --> 00:03:42,390
MATT: Happy birthday, Sam.

55
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,675
MARISHA: So sweet.

56
00:03:43,675 --> 00:03:51,313
MATT: All right, announcements for the evening.
First off, our fantastic sponsor Loot Crate is

57
00:03:51,313 --> 00:03:55,731
back. Sam, do you have anything?

58
00:03:55,731 --> 00:04:04,447
SAM: I prepared a history lesson tonight. It's a
history of crates. Ancient Greece: Zeus presents a

59
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:09,325
lovely crate to the first woman on earth, a lovely
gal named Pandora. It contained death and evil,

60
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:11,039
corrupted the world forevermore.

61
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:17,536
Egypt: 1957, the Ark of the Covenant-- sort of a
crate; it carried the Ten Commandments-- is opened

62
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:23,394
by Colonel Dietrich and Dr. Rene Belloq. Ghosts
fly out, and it melts the faces of several Nazis,

63
00:04:23,394 --> 00:04:25,840
while Indiana Jones hides his face.

64
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,630
Los Angeles, California, 1995: Rookie detective
David Mills, played by Brad Pitt, receives a

65
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,390
cardboard crate from murder suspect John Doe! It
contains the head of his girlfriend, Gwyneth

66
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,538
Paltrow.

67
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:44,846
Your town, present day: you receive a small,
expertly constructed crate that contains geek chic

68
00:04:44,846 --> 00:04:49,793
gear and apparel from The Walking Dead, Nightmare
on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw

69
00:04:49,793 --> 00:04:56,909
Massacre, and Halloween! Now, which would you
rather get? The Ark of the Covenant? Pandora's

70
00:04:56,909 --> 00:05:03,752
box? A box with Gwyneth Paltrow's head in it? Or a
Loot Crate, which you can use code CriticalRole to

71
00:05:03,752 --> 00:05:07,399
get 10% off your monthly crate. Guys, I
think there's only one choice.

72
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:14,099
MARISHA: That might be my favorite one. That might
be my favorite one you've done. That was good.

73
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:18,696
LIAM: We've got to slow you down or Loot Crate is
going to poach you for ads.

74
00:05:18,696 --> 00:05:24,753
SAM: That would be fine! I would much rather do
these! I would do these for money every day!

75
00:05:24,753 --> 00:05:27,438
(laughter)

76
00:05:27,438 --> 00:05:35,641
MATT: Curses! Thank you, Sam. And thank you,
Loot Crate. Head up: me and Taliesin will be flying

77
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:40,740
out tomorrow to be attending a convention this
weekend called Another Anime Convention. Another

78
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,546
Anime Con is in New Hampshire--

79
00:05:42,546 --> 00:05:43,727
LIAM: Florida.

80
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:44,829
MARISHA: Boston.

81
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:46,407
MATT: No! I looked it up.

82
00:05:46,407 --> 00:05:47,632
MARISHA: You're not sure.

83
00:05:47,632 --> 00:05:51,628
MATT: (giggles) We'll be doing panels and signings
and all kinds of other fun stuff this weekend, so

84
00:05:51,628 --> 00:05:55,508
please come and say hi, ask questions, bring
things to get signed. Come meet us; we would love

85
00:05:55,508 --> 00:06:02,204
to see you. It'll be a lot of fun. Also, Marisha,
you have a new Signal Boost run coming up you want

86
00:06:02,204 --> 00:06:03,223
to talk about?

87
00:06:03,223 --> 00:06:10,244
MARISHA: Oh yes! We're doing a Halloween special
edition. Two runs, starting Tuesday, and we're

88
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:16,305
bringing back all the hosts! Taliesin and I are
the first episode, and I know you guys love us, so

89
00:06:16,305 --> 00:06:21,045
for everyone who's like, "I'm not watching anymore
because Taliesin's not the host anymore!" Now you

90
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:22,113
should watch again.

91
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:23,747
TALIESIN: I'm back. What are you going to do?

92
00:06:23,747 --> 00:06:29,928
MARISHA: You're good at the spooky stuff. You
basically built our list. It was amazing. It's all

93
00:06:29,928 --> 00:06:31,050
good stuff.

94
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,026
MATT: Liam, you had a new project you want to talk
about, as well?

95
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:40,871
LIAM: Yes. I am continuing to be Doctor Strange in
various Marvel animated things, and on digital HD,

96
00:06:40,871 --> 00:06:46,309
they've got a new animated feature called Marvel's
Hulk: Where Monsters Dwell, and I am still the

97
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:51,489
sorcerer supreme, where I say things like "eye of
Tamagotchi" and "sphere of Esperanto" and other

98
00:06:51,489 --> 00:06:53,728
such spells. Check it out.

99
00:06:53,796 --> 00:06:54,874
LAURA: I'm in that.

100
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:55,933
LIAM: Are you?

101
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:57,539
LAURA: I'm in that with you.

102
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,806
LIAM: Can you say who you are? Who are you?

103
00:06:59,806 --> 00:07:01,311
TRAVIS: How about no. Probably not.

104
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:02,740
MATT: The glory hosts of Hogwarts.

105
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,427
LAURA: You'll hear me.

106
00:07:04,427 --> 00:07:09,499
LIAM: My name was in a press release. Laura will
play some confident kickass someone or other. Like

107
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:10,596
you do.

108
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,479
LAURA: Whoa, that was double ones!

109
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:16,633
MATT: Good, you got them out of the way! Stop
rolling, Laura. Save it for the battle.

110
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:19,272
SAM: Battle? Wait, we're going to battle?

111
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,084
TRAVIS: Yeah, rap-battle.

112
00:07:21,084 --> 00:07:28,699
MATT: I guess it depends. All right, so! Now that
our announcements are out of the way, tension

113
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:29,534
builds--

114
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:32,148
LAURA: No! Gears of War came out this week!

115
00:07:32,148 --> 00:07:36,138
MATT: Let's go ahead and dive into tonight's
episode of Critical Role.

116
00:07:36,138 --> 00:09:06,507
[dramatic music]

117
00:09:06,507 --> 00:09:13,047
MATT: And welcome back. So! Picking up where we
left off, Vox Machina, in their journey to destroy

118
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:18,441
the Chroma Conclave, a gathering of chromatic
dragons that have torn through the Tal'Dorei

119
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:25,272
countryside and taken up residence and calling it
their domain, they've defeated Umbrasyl. They have

120
00:09:25,272 --> 00:09:30,879
their sights set on the next series of dragons. In
the process of setting up a timeline in which they

121
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:38,140
had to bait the white dragon Vorugal in the ravine
outside of the ruins of Draconia, hopefully to

122
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,398
jump on and destroy the dragon.

123
00:09:40,398 --> 00:09:44,759
They were approached in Whitestone by an
individual that apparently was not Seeker Assum,

124
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:51,128
an ally of theirs from long ago. Instead it was
one of the dragons of the Conclave: Raishan, the

125
00:09:51,128 --> 00:09:58,658
green dragon, who had come to parley and actually
offer an alliance, seemingly unhappy with the

126
00:09:58,658 --> 00:10:05,321
current set of rules and lack of interest from
Thordak in making up his side of the bargain which

127
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:14,561
was struck. Raishan has asked for your aid in
destroying the swollen, dangerous red dragon. You

128
00:10:14,561 --> 00:10:20,696
guys asked, as a showing of faith, to have Raishan
come with you to the ruins of Draconia, gather the

129
00:10:20,696 --> 00:10:29,688
Ravenites, and destroy Vorugal alongside you. As
such, you gathered Lady Kima as an ally in this

130
00:10:29,688 --> 00:10:38,580
endeavor. You transported yourselves to the snow-
and ice-covered ravine. Just now have taken up in

131
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:48,012
Scanlan's Magnificent Mansion, and are laying down
for an evening's rest. So. As you guys wake up the

132
00:10:48,012 --> 00:10:51,151
next morning, or before you do--

133
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,836
LAURA: No.

134
00:10:52,836 --> 00:10:54,540
SAM and MARISHA: We don't sleep?

135
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,488
LAURA: No.

136
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,649
SAM: Why're you waking me up?

137
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:07,926
LAURA: Because I was thinking, maybe it's a bad
idea to go jumping into this tomorrow. Don't you

138
00:11:07,926 --> 00:11:10,531
think maybe we should wait a day?

139
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:12,528
SAM: Sure?

140
00:11:12,528 --> 00:11:18,626
LAURA: I mean, we could watch Vorugal, see what's
going on, see what his behavior is, and also

141
00:11:18,626 --> 00:11:25,170
prepare a little bit more with the Ravenites. But,
that happening, you might have to inform them that

142
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,982
he's not actually going to have a--

143
00:11:28,982 --> 00:11:30,480
SAM: An attack?

144
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,668
LAURA: Tomorrow.

145
00:11:31,668 --> 00:11:35,931
SAM: But we literally just got back from telling
them to be ready to move tomorrow morning.

146
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:37,375
LAURA: I know.

147
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:44,574
MARISHA: Percy, how are you feeling? You know, he
seems all right.

148
00:11:44,574 --> 00:11:48,526
LAURA: No, he would have extra day to recover!
Percy's not himself yet.

149
00:11:48,526 --> 00:11:51,030
TALIESIN: I am sleeping in the corner, I would assume.

150
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,824
TRAVIS: He does look a little weak, even for his
standards.

151
00:11:53,824 --> 00:11:55,130
MARISHA: A little pale.

152
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,962
LAURA: I just don't think it's the best idea to
jump into this.

153
00:11:57,962 --> 00:11:59,849
TRAVIS: (burps loudly)

154
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:03,310
SAM: So we have to go back and tell them--

155
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,063
LIAM: Literally just got back.

156
00:12:05,063 --> 00:12:09,801
SAM: And they were pissed. They were super pissed
that we were there. We could go back.

157
00:12:09,801 --> 00:12:13,761
LAURA: Do you go back in the morning or do you go
back now?

158
00:12:13,761 --> 00:12:17,990
MARISHA: I feel like time is of the essence here.
Probably not best to wait until morning.

159
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,731
SAM: Tooma is not going to be pleased.

160
00:12:19,731 --> 00:12:21,261
MARISHA: Look, she already hates us.

161
00:12:21,261 --> 00:12:22,207
SAM: That's true.

162
00:12:22,207 --> 00:12:23,669
TRAVIS: Yeah. Can't get any worse.

163
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:24,913
LIAM: It could.

164
00:12:24,913 --> 00:12:30,626
TRAVIS: What, we're freeing them from a dragon. We
are bearers of good tidings.

165
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:32,417
MARISHA: Are we?

166
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:33,506
TRAVIS: Yeah!

167
00:12:33,506 --> 00:12:34,950
MARISHA: (groans)

168
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:39,999
TRAVIS: Now do we totally trust Tooma and the
Ravenites? Do we want to give her all the details

169
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:45,263
or just that we're going to be checking it out for
one day more before we ring the dinner bell?

170
00:12:45,263 --> 00:12:48,008
SAM: What are the details?

171
00:12:48,008 --> 00:12:53,173
TRAVIS: Well, if we have an extra day, what does
that get us?

172
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:56,659
MARISHA: We can maybe try and get Pike.

173
00:12:56,659 --> 00:12:58,460
TRAVIS: Ooh.

174
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,013
MARISHA: Gives us an extra day for Pike.

175
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,354
TRAVIS: How do we do that?

176
00:13:02,354 --> 00:13:03,960
SAM: I don't know.

177
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:09,822
MARISHA: I can go get her, theoretically, if we
have an extra day.

178
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:13,550
TRAVIS: Which I think we do. But I think we need
you here, right?

179
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:22,214
MARISHA: She does have the stone, right? She does
have the stone? I think she has the stone.

180
00:13:22,214 --> 00:13:23,622
LAURA: Yeah, she has the stone.

181
00:13:23,622 --> 00:13:24,768
MARISHA: Okay.

182
00:13:24,768 --> 00:13:29,018
TRAVIS: We're going to be setting a trap, right?

183
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:30,042
LAURA: Yes.

184
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:33,181
TRAVIS: So maybe we make that trap more better?

185
00:13:33,181 --> 00:13:36,701
LAURA: What exactly did you tell Tooma was going
to happen?

186
00:13:36,701 --> 00:13:45,673
SAM: Be ready to attack tomorrow morning. We're
going to deliver a giant beast for the dragon to

187
00:13:45,673 --> 00:13:50,764
hunt, and that her people should be ready to
strike. That's it.

188
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:54,083
LAURA: Did you tell her to tell Vorugal anything
in particular?

189
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:59,597
LIAM: No, but we don't know if she has or not.
They've got their necks on the line. I know

190
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:02,194
they're not to be trusted, but they're in a
precarious position, as well.

191
00:14:02,194 --> 00:14:05,815
MARISHA: Well, we don't want to necessarily have
them jump in right away. We want them to set

192
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:10,010
Vorugal on Yenk, correct?

193
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:14,571
LAURA: Yes. Shouldn't she inform Vorugal that the
monster is coming?

194
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:16,612
MARISHA: Glorified messengers at this point.

195
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:17,662
TRAVIS: Who's Yenk?

196
00:14:17,662 --> 00:14:20,434
LAURA: The big monster that we're setting for
him.

197
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:21,711
MARISHA: The goristro.

198
00:14:21,711 --> 00:14:23,829
TRAVIS: What's that? He's like a ram?

199
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:27,893
LAURA: Yeah, a giant ram. Haven't you seen the
picture? Did you see the picture?

200
00:14:27,893 --> 00:14:31,247
TRAVIS: No. I'm the only one that really
appreciates pictures, and I haven't seen it.

201
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:32,679
MARISHA: Oh, that's unfortunate.

202
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:36,248
LAURA: I'll go grab the book from Percy as he's
sleeping.

203
00:14:36,248 --> 00:14:41,292
TALIESIN: Roll for it!

204
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:42,539
SAM: You don't get to say roll!

205
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:43,997
LAURA: You don't get to say roll for it!

206
00:14:43,997 --> 00:14:46,820
LIAM: I've said that, and he's ignored me, so you
don't get to say shit!

207
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,350
TALIESIN: Matt! Dad, make her roll for it!

208
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,772
MATT: For?

209
00:14:50,772 --> 00:14:54,318
LAURA: I'm just trying the big book of beasts away
from Percy as he's sleeping.

210
00:14:54,318 --> 00:14:56,462
SAM: He's not sleeping <i>on</i> it, is he?

211
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,810
TALIESIN: It's in my possession.

212
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,972
MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage.

213
00:14:59,972 --> 00:15:01,454
TALIESIN: All right. That'll do.

214
00:15:01,454 --> 00:15:04,257
TRAVIS: Say it so confidently.

215
00:15:04,257 --> 00:15:07,272
LAURA: Subtract some, because you're still really
tired from being dead!

216
00:15:07,272 --> 00:15:08,397
TALIESIN: That's disadvantage.

217
00:15:08,397 --> 00:15:11,258
MATT: And minus two on both of these rolls.

218
00:15:11,258 --> 00:15:13,399
TALIESIN: Oh, and minus two. That's 14.

219
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:15,253
MATT: Yeah, she slips it off you.

220
00:15:15,253 --> 00:15:16,521
TALIESIN: Okay.

221
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:19,714
MATT: This is what you see.

222
00:15:19,714 --> 00:15:21,082
LAURA: That's what we see, Grog!

223
00:15:21,082 --> 00:15:26,322
TRAVIS: Wait. Is that like this, is it like me?

224
00:15:26,322 --> 00:15:28,463
SAM: We don't know! We haven't seen this thing.

225
00:15:28,463 --> 00:15:34,378
MATT: It's clustered around a bunch of other art pieces
of other demonic-looking entities, and it is by and

226
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:40,140
large about twice to four times the size of
anything else on the page depicted.

227
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,479
TRAVIS: That's really big.

228
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:43,099
MARISHA: Two Grogs? Is it like two Grogs?

229
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:45,866
MATT: There's no picture of Grog in there. You
have no sense of scale.

230
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:49,021
SAM: Quick! Draw a picture of Grog, and then we'll
know.

231
00:15:49,021 --> 00:15:52,454
TRAVIS: I'll draw it full scale! I put my hand on the
page.

232
00:15:52,454 --> 00:15:54,633
LAURA: Oh, he's tiny!

233
00:15:54,633 --> 00:16:02,610
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think he's hand-held. Maybe we
need like a few Yenks. Everyone can do with a few Yenks.

234
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,738
(laughter)

235
00:16:06,738 --> 00:16:10,148
LIAM: Jeez. We're all about to die tomorrow or the
day after.

236
00:16:10,148 --> 00:16:18,352
TRAVIS: Wait! Vax and Scanlan, when you're within,
did you see Vorugal in your travels?

237
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:26,804
SAM: No, we kept out of sight in the caverns and
Vorugal we don't think saw us, but we also didn't

238
00:16:26,804 --> 00:16:28,145
see Vorugal, either.

239
00:16:28,145 --> 00:16:31,888
TRAVIS: Do you think you could replicate your path in
the daylight?

240
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:37,266
LAURA: I think he would see them. What if you
became a fly or something and flew down? Would he

241
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:38,384
notice you?

242
00:16:38,384 --> 00:16:44,755
SAM: Wouldn't see me. I don't want to speak for
Vax, but if we're going back tonight, you no

243
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:48,548
longer have the ability to fly, is that true? But
you do, Vexy?

244
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:51,565
LAURA: I do. And I can speak Draconic.

245
00:16:51,565 --> 00:16:54,032
SAM: Oh, yeah. Well, that would've been helpful
last time, actually.

246
00:16:54,032 --> 00:16:57,890
LAURA: Sorry. I didn't think about that last
time.

247
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:05,867
SAM: But yes, if I were a fly-- I assume any of us
can avoid his detection if we stay low and

248
00:17:05,867 --> 00:17:09,349
invisible. Well, yes.

249
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,909
LAURA: All right.

250
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:12,114
SAM: Right?

251
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,842
LAURA: Can you make me invisible?

252
00:17:13,842 --> 00:17:15,502
MARISHA: I can't. He can.

253
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:16,862
SAM: I can make you invisible.

254
00:17:16,862 --> 00:17:18,974
TRAVIS: Are we going to go now, or are we going in
the morning?

255
00:17:18,974 --> 00:17:21,651
LAURA: We'll pop down tonight to talk to her one
more time.

256
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:22,713
TRAVIS: All right.

257
00:17:22,713 --> 00:17:24,098
MARISHA: So you're telling them?

258
00:17:24,098 --> 00:17:28,656
LAURA: Hold off a day. She's going to be so
pissed.

259
00:17:28,656 --> 00:17:33,659
MARISHA: Are we going to go back and see them
again? Okay, we'll just say: next morning, then

260
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:37,781
you go say, "hey, we got an awesome thing for
you." Okay.

261
00:17:37,781 --> 00:17:43,337
TRAVIS: Yeah. If we're summoning a few good Yenks,
do we have a spot that we want to say stay away from?

262
00:17:43,337 --> 00:17:46,617
MARISHA: Well, they gave us a location of the
stones.

263
00:17:46,617 --> 00:17:48,688
SAM: She told us to release Yenk--

264
00:17:48,688 --> 00:17:51,035
TRAVIS: Oh, on the summoning stones.

265
00:17:51,035 --> 00:18:01,528
SAM: The summoning circle or something like that.
All right?

266
00:18:01,528 --> 00:18:04,130
TRAVIS: I've got to go pee.

267
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:09,213
LIAM: Also, when we were there, we weren't allowed
to bring any weapons in, so you're going to have

268
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,550
to dump--

269
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,877
LAURA: Nothing?!

270
00:18:11,877 --> 00:18:13,701
SAM: I'm leaving mine in the mansion.

271
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:15,532
LAURA: (groans)

272
00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:18,128
SAM: Bring something that you don't mind putting
down.

273
00:18:18,128 --> 00:18:19,850
LIAM: Yeah, don't bring your best.

274
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,084
LAURA: Fenthras.

275
00:18:21,084 --> 00:18:22,995
SAM: No, leave that at home.

276
00:18:22,995 --> 00:18:30,502
LIAM: I'll take it. I'm not going to use it; I
don't know how! Barely. Woo-hoo!

277
00:18:30,502 --> 00:18:37,832
LAURA: Now you've got three Vestiges! Should we
go, then? Can you make me invisible and we go?

278
00:18:37,832 --> 00:18:42,220
SAM: I can make you invisible. You can fly us down
through the cavern, but you're going to have to be

279
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,392
super stealthy.

280
00:18:43,392 --> 00:18:45,342
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to cast Pass Without a
Trace on us.

281
00:18:45,342 --> 00:18:49,103
SAM: Okay. Don't know how that'll work if we're
flying, but okay. Doesn't that cover our tracks?

282
00:18:49,103 --> 00:18:58,667
Oh, that's the stealth rolls thing? Okay, good.
Wait, Keyleth, will you hold onto my Mythcarver

283
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:00,140
sword for me?

284
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:00,966
MARISHA: Sure!

285
00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:01,992
SAM: I can trust you.

286
00:19:01,992 --> 00:19:04,026
MARISHA: Of course! (giggles)

287
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:05,674
SAM: Oh boy. That's a big smile.

288
00:19:05,674 --> 00:19:07,515
MARISHA: You can trust me.

289
00:19:07,515 --> 00:19:09,910
SAM: Okay. Don't kill anyone with it.

290
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:13,735
MATT: Keyleth finally has a Vestige.

291
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:21,197
MARISHA: I do! I was the last one, you guys! It
feels-- doesn't really feel like anything.

292
00:19:21,197 --> 00:19:23,571
LAURA: Once you attune it to yourself--

293
00:19:23,571 --> 00:19:24,758
MARISHA: Sure.

294
00:19:24,758 --> 00:19:26,938
LIAM: Scanlan feels the same way, don't you
Scanlan?

295
00:19:26,938 --> 00:19:33,780
SAM: I feel nothing. Sometimes I have to hold it
with my left hand so it feels different.

296
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,354
MARISHA: I switch hands.

297
00:19:35,354 --> 00:19:37,658
(laughter)

298
00:19:37,658 --> 00:19:38,771
MARISHA: Still nothing.

299
00:19:38,771 --> 00:19:40,312
TRAVIS: When you call it the stranger--

300
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:48,836
MATT: So as you cast Pass Without a Trace on
yourself and Scanlan, the shadows of the mansion

301
00:19:48,836 --> 00:19:55,477
cling to you a little darker, a little more
crushed. You wish to cast Invisibility on Vex, you said?

302
00:19:55,477 --> 00:20:00,341
SAM: Yes, I will use yet another 3rd-level
Invisibility spell to make us both invisible.

303
00:20:00,341 --> 00:20:03,607
MATT: All right. You both jump onto the back of her
broom.

304
00:20:03,607 --> 00:20:04,674
LAURA: Okay.

305
00:20:04,674 --> 00:20:07,646
MATT: And just to double check here--

306
00:20:07,646 --> 00:20:09,055
TRAVIS: The way he said that--

307
00:20:09,055 --> 00:20:11,179
LAURA: No, he said it really terribly.

308
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:12,749
MATT: What do you mean? I didn't say anything!

309
00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:13,891
TRAVIS: You sure did.

310
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:15,587
LAURA: Sure did!

311
00:20:15,587 --> 00:20:20,593
MATT: I'll say technically you're carrying the
broom, so the broom will also be invisible. Okay,

312
00:20:20,593 --> 00:20:26,507
so as you're holding the broom, you both leap onto
it, the two of you and the broom vanish, and you

313
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:29,120
guys are free to exit the mansion at your
disposal.

314
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,801
SAM: Yeah, so we made a right here and left here
and right at the big rock.

315
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:38,314
LAURA: Is anybody going to keep track of us like
you kept track of Vex-- Vax. I just called my

316
00:20:38,314 --> 00:20:41,285
brother me. I just did that.

317
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:44,328
SAM: Vex is the girl one. Vax is the boy.

318
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:53,859
LAURA: Is somebody going to be around in case
something goes horribly wrong?

319
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:58,921
LIAM: I'll go with you if Kiki wants to turn me
into a crow or a fly or something. I'll stay back

320
00:20:58,921 --> 00:21:00,790
and watch.

321
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,532
LAURA: Stay up like Kiki did before.

322
00:21:02,532 --> 00:21:08,700
MARISHA: I mean I could do what I did before and
follow you as Minxie. Worked last time. I still

323
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,158
have my one last shape, as well.

324
00:21:10,158 --> 00:21:12,365
SAM: Isn't Minxie big and spottable?

325
00:21:12,365 --> 00:21:16,382
MARISHA: It's a mountain-based tiger. I'm a white
snow tiger.

326
00:21:16,382 --> 00:21:17,833
SAM: That's so hot.

327
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:25,131
MARISHA: It's actually very cold in the mountains.
That's why they have thick coats.

328
00:21:25,131 --> 00:21:27,743
TRAVIS: You don't think Vorugal is going to think
that's a midnight snack?

329
00:21:27,743 --> 00:21:29,840
MARISHA: Who, me?

330
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,526
TRAVIS: Yeah, you. Big white tiger?

331
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:35,840
MARISHA: He didn't see me before.

332
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,167
TRAVIS: Oh okay.

333
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:44,650
MARISHA: Let me see something. Hang on, because
this'll tell me because Polymorph-- you might go

334
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,145
out of my range. Is the only problem.

335
00:21:48,145 --> 00:21:51,324
SAM: Polymorph just lasts. Wait, no.

336
00:21:51,324 --> 00:21:52,845
MATT: Nope, concentration.

337
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:54,309
SAM: So he has to stay within range.

338
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:56,049
MARISHA: Range is 60 feet.

339
00:21:56,049 --> 00:22:00,625
MATT: No, that's just to cast it. I'm pretty sure
he can go off on his own as long as you maintain

340
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:01,744
concentration.

341
00:22:01,744 --> 00:22:07,597
MARISHA: Okay. Can I? He can go. Do you want to
go? All right. What do you want to be?

342
00:22:07,597 --> 00:22:10,054
LIAM: Something white.

343
00:22:10,054 --> 00:22:13,087
LAURA: Something very small. Like a moth, a white
moth.

344
00:22:13,087 --> 00:22:16,740
SAM: It's got to be something that can go as fast as
we're going.

345
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,389
LAURA: He can sit on my shoulder. No?

346
00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:22,599
LIAM: Yeah, but then if you guys get fucked I'm
dead, as well.

347
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:24,535
LAURA: I'll just smack you and then you'll become you
again.

348
00:22:24,535 --> 00:22:27,281
LIAM: So it'll just be like every day. All right,
yeah.

349
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:28,661
MARISHA: It's true.

350
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:31,730
LAURA: Right? If I smack him, it's not going to
kill him, he just turns back into--

351
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:38,208
SAM: If he were a black crow or something he could
fly back on its own. A moth can't travel a mile.

352
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,241
LAURA: Make him a white crow.

353
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:42,417
LIAM: Yeah, can you make me an albino crow?

354
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:46,654
MARISHA: Sure! I don't see why not.

355
00:22:46,654 --> 00:22:48,838
SAM: With one yellow eye and one black eye.

356
00:22:48,838 --> 00:22:50,371
TRAVIS: Oh get on with it, fuckers!

357
00:22:50,371 --> 00:22:52,488
(laughter)

358
00:22:52,488 --> 00:22:55,905
MARISHA: I do that. With one yellow eye and one
black eye.

359
00:22:55,905 --> 00:23:03,447
MATT: All right. And as your form shifts to the
first probably albino crow to wander the landscape

360
00:23:03,447 --> 00:23:09,687
here in Wildemount, you are able to follow them,
should you so chose.

361
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:17,572
MARISHA: To match Vex, I give him one little blue
feather, just off the side. Little blue streak.

362
00:23:17,572 --> 00:23:20,797
LIAM: A little bit; this isn't Percy's, but
(caws).

363
00:23:20,797 --> 00:23:22,816
(laughter)

364
00:23:22,816 --> 00:23:24,694
TALIESIN: (caws)

365
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,650
LAURA: Come on, let's go. Come on.

366
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,304
SAM: All right, let's go.

367
00:23:28,304 --> 00:23:34,077
MATT: You guys make your way outside into the
heavy snowfall, across the top of the ravine. You

368
00:23:34,077 --> 00:23:40,210
go ahead and make a survival check to try and
follow the tracks of Minxie to the outskirts of

369
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,889
where you guys were last time.

370
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:47,890
SAM: Do I also get to give her any assistance,
like "we went this way, go that way?"

371
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:51,333
MATT: Yeah. You know what, giving you the assist,
go ahead and roll with advantage on that.

372
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:53,909
TRAVIS: Oh, that's lucky.

373
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:56,402
SAM: Dice jail already?

374
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:58,847
LAURA: Yeah. Definitely already. 17.

375
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:03,657
MATT: Okay. Takes you a little bit of time, but
you manage to find your way back through the heavy

376
00:24:03,657 --> 00:24:07,966
snowfall. It's freezing cold and your teeth are
starting to chatter a little bit, but you manage

377
00:24:07,966 --> 00:24:14,082
to make your way to the top of the ravine, dipping
down where you find the cavern entrance at the

378
00:24:14,082 --> 00:24:20,488
bottom, leading into where Tooma and rest of the
Ravenites at least seem to have the central

379
00:24:20,488 --> 00:24:27,532
portion of their society within the mountain
itself. You guys come down. It's a little warmer

380
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:34,276
the further into the rock you travel. The snow
turns to slush, then to damp ground, to dry rock

381
00:24:34,276 --> 00:24:35,592
and stone.

382
00:24:35,592 --> 00:24:38,264
LAURA: I get off the broom and put it behind me.

383
00:24:38,264 --> 00:24:45,606
MATT: Okay. Both still walking invisibly, with you
now (whoosh) walking behind them, hopping as the

384
00:24:45,606 --> 00:24:47,071
white crow.

385
00:24:47,071 --> 00:24:53,277
SAM: We should do the same thing we did last time.
I know you weren't here. We turned visible, asked

386
00:24:53,277 --> 00:24:59,111
to guards to go-- It's going to be really shitty
when we get in there, because she's going to hate us.

387
00:24:59,111 --> 00:25:03,294
LAURA: All right. Ow! Fuck you! Stop it!

388
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:06,963
SAM: I will drop invisibility. Are the guards
around?

389
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,738
MATT: You guys are just on the outskirts of the
entranceway.

390
00:25:09,738 --> 00:25:12,539
SAM: Oh, we'll stay invisible until we get to
the guards.

391
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:17,022
MATT: To the center of the town, or outside of
Tooma's--

392
00:25:17,022 --> 00:25:19,163
LAURA: Oh! I thought we were already in the cave.

393
00:25:19,163 --> 00:25:22,834
MATT: You're inside the cave. There's a path in
there and it opens up into the actual subterranean

394
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:27,743
village, and then in there, across from this
fountain area, is where Tooma's tent is.

395
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:30,216
SAM: Where did we meet the guards last time?

396
00:25:30,216 --> 00:25:32,076
MATT: As soon as you entered the main village
area.

397
00:25:32,076 --> 00:25:33,721
SAM: That's where we want to meet them again.

398
00:25:33,721 --> 00:25:39,453
MATT: So as you both drop your invisibility guise,
with your white crow friend hopping behind you,

399
00:25:39,453 --> 00:25:46,082
the same two guards are still patrolling. Only one
of them notices you. Turns around and gives an odd

400
00:25:46,082 --> 00:25:49,033
look, his head cocked to the side as he grabs his
spear and puts it towards you again.

401
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:54,069
SAM: Yep, same routine. We'll leave our weapons
here. This is my friend Vex. We'd like to see

402
00:25:54,069 --> 00:26:01,157
Tooma again. I know it's very upsetting that we
have to make these night calls like this but it's

403
00:26:01,157 --> 00:26:02,413
very important.

404
00:26:02,413 --> 00:26:05,525
LAURA: I speak in Draconic. I say: Sorry, my
friend rambles.

405
00:26:05,525 --> 00:26:08,133
LIAM: (hacking spit)

406
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:13,580
LAURA: My broom takes off behind me.

407
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:20,254
MATT: Yeah, exactly. Vanishes forever. Keeping the
spear there, yells out (foreign word), and the

408
00:26:20,254 --> 00:26:26,725
other soldier who's wandering, turns around, looks and
sees, steps over, puts his spear down, and they

409
00:26:26,725 --> 00:26:35,927
both have a conversation briefly. You can, as I
recall, speak Draconic and can read lips, is that

410
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:42,344
what it was? Yeah. They're both discussing why
these stupid people keep coming back and bothering

411
00:26:42,344 --> 00:26:49,731
Tooma, as well as the coming tension of tomorrow's
activities, and how they can't keep interrupting

412
00:26:49,731 --> 00:26:55,979
Tooma if she's going to be keeping her mind
straight. But one of them leaves. The other one

413
00:26:55,979 --> 00:26:59,654
steps, circles around, and begins nudging you both
forward, telling you in Draconic,

414
00:26:59,654 --> 00:27:02,010
"Then go, make it quick."

415
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,208
LAURA: We will.

416
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:10,459
MATT: As you guys stay at the outskirts of Tooma's
tent, the interior light has been sufficiently

417
00:27:10,459 --> 00:27:15,455
dimmed, as it was before, with a little bit of the
embers that are still there in the fire pit in the

418
00:27:15,455 --> 00:27:23,996
center. Now, barely cracking ember. Tooma is
passed out and curled up inside her throne-like

419
00:27:23,996 --> 00:27:32,455
chair, as one of the other dragonborn soldiers
comes over and nudges her gently, "Tooma. They

420
00:27:32,455 --> 00:27:40,468
"return." She rakes towards his face. He barely
ducks out of the way. Unnatural speed for a

421
00:27:40,468 --> 00:27:46,185
creature as old as she is, per se, but then the
hand recoils back with a snapping sound, and she

422
00:27:46,185 --> 00:27:53,670
wakes up, "You come again?"

423
00:27:53,670 --> 00:28:00,165
SAM: Yes. We offer profound apologies for waking
you from your slumber again.

424
00:28:00,165 --> 00:28:02,960
MATT: Snaps her arm back into place. (cracking)

425
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:13,455
LAURA: In Draconic: we apologize for waking you
up. Unfortunately, I sent my brother here before

426
00:28:13,455 --> 00:28:22,317
with our compatriot, and he spoke out of turn.
We're actually planning the attack the day after

427
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:24,110
tomorrow.

428
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:35,137
MATT: (sigh, foreign words) Which you recognize
as, "Tell the others: wait a day." And one of her

429
00:28:35,137 --> 00:28:39,179
servants wanders off behind you guys and exits the
tent. She turns back to you.

430
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:44,367
"Then what is to be done?"

431
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:49,826
LAURA: We'll be releasing a very large fiend.

432
00:28:49,826 --> 00:28:54,404
SAM: At the spot where you told us.

433
00:28:54,404 --> 00:28:56,376
MATT: "At the stones, yes."

434
00:28:56,376 --> 00:29:03,501
LAURA: The stones. We hope that you will inform Vorugal
that it's going to happen. He'll head over,

435
00:29:03,501 --> 00:29:09,501
fight-fight-fight. He becomes much weaker, we jump
in, fight-fight-fight.

436
00:29:09,501 --> 00:29:15,177
MATT: "It'll be done. Do not mess this up."

437
00:29:15,177 --> 00:29:22,859
SAM: Question, before we go. Typically when you've
done this in the past, you inform Vorugal and he

438
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:28,571
heads on over right away? Does he need to see
evidence of a hunt? How does it work? Do you

439
00:29:28,571 --> 00:29:30,098
typically inform him?

440
00:29:30,098 --> 00:29:34,164
MATT: "I do not inform. Skork does the
informing."

441
00:29:34,164 --> 00:29:35,246
SAM: Skork?

442
00:29:35,246 --> 00:29:37,030
LAURA: Yes, Skork. I remember him.

443
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:43,259
SAM: And is there some sort of hunt horn or
anything that signals the beginning of this, or

444
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:44,389
does it just happen?

445
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:51,773
MATT: "Depending on where the prey is, whether it
be nearby forests or presented in chains to the cinder

446
00:29:51,773 --> 00:29:57,302
"stones of which I've sent you, Vorugal begins the
chase."

447
00:29:57,302 --> 00:30:01,424
LAURA: He won't be in chains, exactly. Is that all
right?

448
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:02,828
MATT: "Just keep it there."

449
00:30:02,828 --> 00:30:05,011
LAURA: Oh, okay.

450
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:14,231
SAM: I don't want to mess this up. If Vorugal were
to see anyone near this summoning circle, would he

451
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:18,531
be suspicious, or would he be okay with it?

452
00:30:18,531 --> 00:30:26,587
MATT: "If it is not a Ravenite, it would probably
make them part of the hunt."

453
00:30:26,587 --> 00:30:28,354
SAM: Okay. Good to know.

454
00:30:28,354 --> 00:30:31,631
LAURA: Good news. Good. Great.

455
00:30:31,631 --> 00:30:33,049
MATT: "Is that all?"

456
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:38,490
LAURA: That's all. Be pleased. We will see you in
a couple of days.

457
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:42,665
SAM: There's like a 50/50 chance we'll come back
again tonight.

458
00:30:42,665 --> 00:30:44,143
LAURA: No it's not. We're not.

459
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:45,422
SAM: No? 60/40.

460
00:30:45,422 --> 00:30:46,503
LAURA: Let's just go.

461
00:30:46,503 --> 00:30:47,580
SAM: We're out of here.

462
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,892
MATT: "Leave me!"

463
00:30:48,892 --> 00:30:49,879
SAM: Sorry.

464
00:30:49,879 --> 00:30:54,116
LAURA: Again, I apologize for my brother. He's an
idiot.

465
00:30:54,116 --> 00:30:58,886
MATT: She doesn't even pay you guys any mind, just
curls over, takes her heavy robes and like wraps

466
00:30:58,886 --> 00:31:03,494
them around her and curls up into a small little
bundle of old dragonborn woman. The rest of the

467
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:10,259
soldiers close in, cutting you off from her, and
they all give you the very stern look that you

468
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:12,654
have seen many times that tells you, "get the fuck
out."

469
00:31:12,654 --> 00:31:17,558
LAURA: Okay. You make us invisible?

470
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:21,419
SAM: Oh yeah, invisibility yet again. I'm out of
3rd-level spells.

471
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:27,535
LAURA: Is Pass Without a Trace still active on us?
It's up to an hour.

472
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:30,105
MATT: Yeah it'd still be active.

473
00:31:30,105 --> 00:31:34,053
LIAM: As they're leaving, not wanting to get left
out, I fly down from the air and land in my sister's

474
00:31:34,053 --> 00:31:39,651
hair and like a cat (growls) into the top of her
head five or seven or 12 times.

475
00:31:39,651 --> 00:31:41,732
LAURA: Thank you.

476
00:31:41,732 --> 00:31:43,091
LIAM: (caws)

477
00:31:43,091 --> 00:31:44,222
MARISHA: So tangled.

478
00:31:44,222 --> 00:31:50,510
MATT: Instantaneous bedhead. You can't even see
it, but you can feel it and it bothers you. All

479
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:57,316
right. You guys both are invisible, the bird
clutching to your side. You take the broom back up

480
00:31:57,316 --> 00:32:04,050
into the snowy storm. I need you both to make
stealth checks with advantage.

481
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:06,308
LAURA: I thought we were invisible. We're
invisible.

482
00:32:06,308 --> 00:32:08,192
SAM: Yes, I've made us invisible again.

483
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,458
LIAM: Big bonus.

484
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:10,649
LAURA: Okay, stealth checks.

485
00:32:10,649 --> 00:32:12,891
SAM: With advantage?

486
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:15,314
LAURA: Plus ten to whatever you roll.

487
00:32:15,314 --> 00:32:18,991
SAM: Oh snap! 12, 22--

488
00:32:18,991 --> 00:32:20,421
LAURA: 36.

489
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:22,807
SAM: 24.

490
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:29,355
MATT: All right. You guys make your way up out of
the ravine, up onto the top of the snowy banks at

491
00:32:29,355 --> 00:32:36,137
the top of where the cliffsides are. Eventually,
over the next 20 or so minutes, finding the

492
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:40,783
shimmering outskirts of Scanlan's doorway, joining
the rest of the party.

493
00:32:40,783 --> 00:32:46,548
LAURA: Get the fuck off my head, you piece of
shit.

494
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,700
MATT: Polymorph lasts for how long?

495
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,434
MARISHA: An hour.

496
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:57,791
MATT: As soon as you get to the top of ravine, the
white crow (impact) face-down in the snow.

497
00:32:57,791 --> 00:32:59,626
MARISHA: I think it's an hour.

498
00:32:59,626 --> 00:33:03,405
LIAM: Speaking of which: hold still, there's a little
bit of bird shit right there.

499
00:33:03,405 --> 00:33:05,444
LAURA: Aw, I thought you were serious.

500
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:06,763
LIAM: Sorry.

501
00:33:06,763 --> 00:33:08,542
MATT: Thankfully, that doesn't transform, either.

502
00:33:08,542 --> 00:33:11,292
(laughter)

503
00:33:11,292 --> 00:33:14,275
MATT: You make your way back into Scanlan's
mansion.

504
00:33:14,275 --> 00:33:22,703
MARISHA: While they were gone, I, with Fenthras and
Whisper, was playing make-believe archer Vex, like

505
00:33:22,703 --> 00:33:26,390
a 12-year-old in the bedroom with a Nerf bow.

506
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:32,134
MATT: As you enter the front of Scanlan's mansion,
you see Keyleth in the corner, who's pulled

507
00:33:32,134 --> 00:33:37,221
Whisper back in Fenthras, and it goes (dagger
impact) into the wall.

508
00:33:37,221 --> 00:33:43,147
MARISHA: It worked! How did it go, guys?

509
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:45,712
LAURA: Give me the bow, right now.

510
00:33:45,712 --> 00:33:50,660
TRAVIS: Oh, busted.

511
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:54,802
MARISHA: It might be like a cool combo move.

512
00:33:54,802 --> 00:33:58,659
LAURA: I'll think about it. Thank you.

513
00:33:58,659 --> 00:34:00,744
TRAVIS: She take it well?

514
00:34:00,744 --> 00:34:03,559
LAURA: She did! She said she'd wait.

515
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:05,177
SAM: She's a night person. She's okay.

516
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:06,248
TRAVIS: Great.

517
00:34:06,248 --> 00:34:07,262
LAURA: Yeah.

518
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:15,038
MATT: You did catch on the way up, Vex, that even
through the dark sleet-covered snow blaring night,

519
00:34:15,038 --> 00:34:19,256
there is the faint hint of light blue sunrise in
the distance.

520
00:34:19,256 --> 00:34:28,383
LAURA: Oh shit. Day's coming. We didn't sleep! We
need to sleep!

521
00:34:28,383 --> 00:34:32,938
TRAVIS: Wait! Should we see if we can get Pike
first?

522
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:36,676
SAM: First? Do we have any spells to do that?

523
00:34:36,676 --> 00:34:41,457
MARISHA: I can try and scry.

524
00:34:41,457 --> 00:34:45,908
LAURA: What if you take the stone, pop over to
her, then use Tree Stride and come back?

525
00:34:45,908 --> 00:34:48,028
MARISHA: That I can do, yeah.

526
00:34:48,028 --> 00:34:50,661
SAM: You have another Tree Stride in you? Didn't
we get here today?

527
00:34:50,661 --> 00:34:54,112
MARISHA: We did, but if I burn a higher-level
spell, then yeah. What does it matter,

528
00:34:54,112 --> 00:34:55,348
at this point?

529
00:34:55,348 --> 00:34:57,659
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's get all our ducks in a row.

530
00:34:57,659 --> 00:35:01,125
MARISHA: All right. I'll be right back. See you
guys in a minute.

531
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:04,928
LIAM: Bye! A minute passes.

532
00:35:04,928 --> 00:35:11,359
MARISHA: A minute passes. This is like when you
walk the same direction, you say bye, and then you

533
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,060
walk the same direction to the car.

534
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:20,399
MATT: Awkward quiet. You hear Kima snoring with
her back against the foyer wall, just (snoring).

535
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:28,279
Until eventually, the stone begins to glow and pulse
like a dull frozen heartbeat. (pulsing) Keyleth,

536
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:31,757
your eyes open, and you see it flashing in your
hands again, and you look up real fast and before

537
00:35:31,757 --> 00:35:36,606
you can say anything, your mouth opens to say
goodbye before she vanishes in a swirl of glitter

538
00:35:36,606 --> 00:35:38,014
and blue light.

539
00:35:38,014 --> 00:35:39,424
LAURA: Oh shit.

540
00:35:39,424 --> 00:35:44,788
MATT: Now, Pike! Come sit down!

541
00:35:44,788 --> 00:35:52,906
(cheering)

542
00:35:52,906 --> 00:35:54,953
ASHLEY: Hello!

543
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:57,114
MARISHA: I like your jacket! It's really great.

544
00:35:57,114 --> 00:36:00,998
ASHLEY: Oh hi! Okay.

545
00:36:00,998 --> 00:36:03,043
MATT: Just flew in.

546
00:36:03,043 --> 00:36:07,058
ASHLEY: Yeah. Here we go.

547
00:36:07,058 --> 00:36:10,003
(laughter)

548
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:17,315
MATT: So. As the day has gone by and through the
chaos of getting Whitestone ready, trying to

549
00:36:17,315 --> 00:36:23,200
assemble the followers of Sarenrae that you've
gathered, and protecting the remnants of the city

550
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:29,066
as Vox Machina went off, a moment hits you and you
close your eyes and pray to Sarenrae and hope that

551
00:36:29,066 --> 00:36:34,244
all shall be well with your friends, and you wish that
you could be there to help them. And there's a

552
00:36:34,244 --> 00:36:38,873
sudden warmth in your proximity, and then a sudden
flash of blue light, and then nearby, you see a

553
00:36:38,873 --> 00:36:46,205
somewhat cold, damp Keyleth just appear in the
space next to you as you're preparing to lay

554
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:51,292
yourself down for an evening's rest, it being
later at night now, clutching the stone.

555
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,564
ASHLEY: Hey! I was just about to go to bed!

556
00:36:53,564 --> 00:36:56,393
MARISHA: Were you sleeping? This is so awkward!

557
00:36:56,393 --> 00:36:58,771
ASHLEY: I was just saying my prayers.

558
00:36:58,771 --> 00:37:02,456
MARISHA: Oh my gosh.

559
00:37:02,456 --> 00:37:04,522
ASHLEY: I do it as much as I can.

560
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:11,506
MARISHA: You know, I never thought about having
poor timing with these gate stones. I'm so sorry!

561
00:37:11,506 --> 00:37:15,735
ASHLEY: (stammers)

562
00:37:15,735 --> 00:37:17,578
MARISHA: I thought you were on the toilet.

563
00:37:17,578 --> 00:37:19,621
ASHLEY: I know. I'm so glad I wasn't.

564
00:37:19,621 --> 00:37:20,997
MARISHA: Yeah, me too.

565
00:37:20,997 --> 00:37:22,632
ASHLEY: I'm so glad you're here.

566
00:37:22,632 --> 00:37:23,603
MARISHA: I missed you.

567
00:37:23,603 --> 00:37:24,712
ASHLEY: I missed you.

568
00:37:24,712 --> 00:37:26,662
SAM: We saw her literally today.

569
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:30,313
MARISHA: Yeah, but it seems like I went around the
world and back!

570
00:37:30,313 --> 00:37:34,134
ASHLEY: I was thinking today and I was like, "Oh
man, I should've just gone with them."

571
00:37:34,134 --> 00:37:38,247
MARISHA: Yeah, we got all the way there and we
were like, "oh, we forgot Pike!"

572
00:37:38,247 --> 00:37:39,920
ASHLEY: I know. It's okay.

573
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,773
MARISHA: Do you want to go?

574
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:44,147
ASHLEY: Or I will be there now. Let's go.

575
00:37:44,147 --> 00:37:45,257
MARISHA: We can go now.

576
00:37:45,257 --> 00:37:46,082
ASHLEY: Let's do it.

577
00:37:46,082 --> 00:37:47,307
MARISHA: All right.

578
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:50,163
SAM: Is that a new set of dice?

579
00:37:50,163 --> 00:37:55,519
ASHLEY: I had to go buy some because I left all of
my stuff in New York. Let's see how this goes.

580
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:57,503
SAM: You stopped on the way here to buy dice?

581
00:37:57,503 --> 00:38:03,478
ASHLEY: No, I got those a little earlier. We're
okay. We're here. Okay.

582
00:38:03,478 --> 00:38:05,390
MARISHA: Okay. So we Tree Stride back.

583
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:09,882
MATT: Okay. Pike, you gather your materials, your
armor, your weapons. All things that you feel

584
00:38:09,882 --> 00:38:15,763
would be necessary for this type of a conflict.
You rejoin with Keyleth. The two of you find your

585
00:38:15,763 --> 00:38:17,519
way back to the Sun Tree.

586
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:22,081
MARISHA: Right. So yeah, so the leader of
Ravenites, her name is Tooma, and we went there,

587
00:38:22,081 --> 00:38:25,431
and we were talking to her, and I think we have a
plan, but not really a plan, so we're going to

588
00:38:25,431 --> 00:38:28,276
figure it out as we go. All right? Let's go.
That's the plan; you're caught up.

589
00:38:28,276 --> 00:38:34,214
ASHLEY: Okay, great. Hey, guys.

590
00:38:34,214 --> 00:38:36,056
(laughter)

591
00:38:36,056 --> 00:38:43,103
MATT: So as the spell finishes, the Sun Tree
opens, you step through the portal into the slow

592
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:48,453
crawling sunrise. The sun hasn't quite crested,
but you can see through the snowfall, which is

593
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:53,151
lessening at the moment, the distant light blue is
getting lighter and lighter. You probably have

594
00:38:53,151 --> 00:39:00,061
another 30 minutes before the sun hits the actual
horizon line. But as you step out of one of the

595
00:39:00,061 --> 00:39:06,374
trees that you created previous, when you had
journeyed to the ruins of Draconia, you do see

596
00:39:06,374 --> 00:39:11,029
about 150 feet off, the shimmer of the outside
of Scanlan's mansion door.

597
00:39:11,029 --> 00:39:16,369
MARISHA: (whispers) Let's be quiet, okay? Let's do
this.

598
00:39:16,369 --> 00:39:18,722
SAM: Oh, great. Pike's good at quiet.

599
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:20,351
MARISHA: We stealth there.

600
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:22,746
MATT: Both you guys roll stealth checks.

601
00:39:22,746 --> 00:39:24,150
SAM: Oh Jesus.

602
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,548
LIAM: This is so great. Now we can all die
together!

603
00:39:26,548 --> 00:39:29,267
MATT: You have disadvantage, Pike.

604
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:31,700
MARISHA: Oh, that's a natural one.

605
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,100
SAM: Wait, what?

606
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:38,839
ASHLEY: I don't think I can get worse than that;
that is a one.

607
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:41,004
SAM and MATT: Two natural ones?

608
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,675
MARISHA: No!

609
00:39:42,675 --> 00:39:45,382
SAM: Oh my god. The dragon's going to fucking kill
us right now.

610
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:50,308
MARISHA: Oh my god, Pike. The plan hasn't even
started!

611
00:39:50,308 --> 00:39:53,215
LAURA: Dice jail!

612
00:39:53,215 --> 00:39:56,530
LIAM: We're all about to lie down for a three-hour
nap. What are you talking about?

613
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,662
ASHLEY: Off to a great start.

614
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:08,481
MATT: As you guys begin stepping through the snow,
Pike, you take a step and you hear this strange

615
00:40:08,481 --> 00:40:15,019
(cracking) sound and you feel this slight shift
beneath your feet. And you watch as some snow

616
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:17,065
begins to trickle off the side of the cliffside.

617
00:40:17,065 --> 00:40:18,404
MARISHA: Pike?

618
00:40:18,404 --> 00:40:21,872
ASHLEY: I'm going to not move.

619
00:40:21,872 --> 00:40:26,568
MARISHA: I don't move, either. Do we not move or
do we run?

620
00:40:26,568 --> 00:40:30,586
ASHLEY: We should run. We should run because it's
probably coming down!

621
00:40:30,586 --> 00:40:32,100
MARISHA: Run!

622
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,133
(laughter)

623
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:36,933
MATT: As soon as you both push off running,
(whoosh) a portion of the cliff actually shears

624
00:40:36,933 --> 00:40:41,600
off and begins to slide down the side. Pike, if
you could go ahead and roll a dexterity saving

625
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,820
throw real fast.

626
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,171
LAURA: Oh my god, Matt! Why are you trying to kill
her right when she gets here?!

627
00:40:45,171 --> 00:40:47,980
SAM: Yeah, Matt. Why did you roll two natural
ones?

628
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,851
ASHLEY: Wait, what did you say it is?

629
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:52,360
TRAVIS and MATT: A dexterity saving throw.

630
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:58,126
ASHLEY: Wait, I get nothing, okay. A four.

631
00:40:58,126 --> 00:41:01,913
MATT: A four. You begin to see Pike slide down off
the edge.

632
00:41:01,913 --> 00:41:05,246
MARISHA: I cast Grasping Vine to grab onto her.

633
00:41:05,246 --> 00:41:11,461
MATT: With that, some of the reeds, some of the
nearby frozen plants on the edge that were largely

634
00:41:11,461 --> 00:41:15,162
covered with snow that were revealed as the rest
of the snow began to crumble off, a large vine

635
00:41:15,162 --> 00:41:21,110
shoots out, wraps around you, and pulls you back
up onto the side of the cliff: fine. The rest of

636
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:25,918
the rock and snow and ice, you hear (crashing)
clattering into the ravine below.

637
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:27,842
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Go!

638
00:41:27,842 --> 00:41:32,806
MATT: All right, you guys run. You see the doorway
shimmering before you, you get closer and you

639
00:41:32,806 --> 00:41:39,062
hear in the distance, this strangely familiar
distant echoing (growls).

640
00:41:39,062 --> 00:41:41,024
ASHLEY: Aw, come on! What is that noise?

641
00:41:41,024 --> 00:41:42,590
MARISHA: Go, run!

642
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:46,314
MATT: You both just get to the doorway in time.
The snowfall's still there though gentler than it

643
00:41:46,314 --> 00:41:50,185
was in the night. You both dart inside, slamming
the mansion door behind you, into a warmer,

644
00:41:50,185 --> 00:41:52,652
comfortable, quieter atmosphere. (panting)

645
00:41:52,652 --> 00:41:54,167
ASHLEY: Hey!

646
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:55,522
LAURA: What just happened?

647
00:41:55,522 --> 00:41:56,880
LIAM: Jeepers.

648
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,840
TRAVIS: Hey!

649
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,887
ASHLEY: Hey!

650
00:41:58,887 --> 00:42:01,452
TRAVIS: Hey, buddy! Why are you out of breath?

651
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,582
LIAM: You all right? You look white as a ghost.

652
00:42:03,582 --> 00:42:10,095
TALIESIN: Have I had a full night's sleep, at this
point?

653
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:11,600
MATT: No, not yet.

654
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,829
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

655
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:14,328
MARISHA: Dragon might know we're here.

656
00:42:14,328 --> 00:42:15,489
TRAVIS: What, why?

657
00:42:15,489 --> 00:42:21,323
MARISHA: Well, there might've been a rockslide.
And it might've been our fault. I'm not sure.

658
00:42:21,323 --> 00:42:23,693
TRAVIS: You just walked through a tree. Why was
there a rockslide?

659
00:42:23,693 --> 00:42:25,885
MARISHA: I don't know, Grog!

660
00:42:25,885 --> 00:42:27,444
LIAM: The door is easy to see.

661
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:29,043
SAM: The door is shimmery and shiny?

662
00:42:29,043 --> 00:42:31,193
MATT: No, nobody can see through it.

663
00:42:31,193 --> 00:42:33,995
MARISHA: They can see a shimmering door.

664
00:42:33,995 --> 00:42:38,195
MATT: Only if you let them. Only individuals that
you choose can see the entrance.

665
00:42:38,195 --> 00:42:39,990
LAURA: That's great!

666
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:43,403
ASHLEY: So whatever that was just saw us disappear.

667
00:42:43,403 --> 00:42:48,388
LAURA: Oh shit! Grog! Open the door! Dust of
Tracelessness! Out the door! Right now!

668
00:42:48,388 --> 00:42:53,711
TRAVIS: Oh! Yeah, I open the front door and I take
big handful of the Dust of Tracelessness and I

669
00:42:53,711 --> 00:42:55,152
(whack).

670
00:42:55,152 --> 00:43:01,435
MATT: Okay, make a strength check. There's a mild
wind here you're fighting against with dust, so

671
00:43:01,435 --> 00:43:03,041
we'll see.

672
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:04,132
TRAVIS: 14.

673
00:43:04,132 --> 00:43:11,645
MATT: 14? Okay. You take a big old heaping handful
and (whoosh) another one. As you send it out

674
00:43:11,645 --> 00:43:19,914
there, all the snow crusts over and any signs of
footprints, both half-elf or gnomish, turn into a

675
00:43:19,914 --> 00:43:26,327
gentle, untouched solid surface of snow, as you
begin to hear in the distance another echoing

676
00:43:26,327 --> 00:43:28,996
(growl).

677
00:43:28,996 --> 00:43:30,514
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: What is that?

678
00:43:30,514 --> 00:43:32,239
LAURA and SAM: Close the door.

679
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:34,283
LAURA: Close the door, Grog!

680
00:43:34,283 --> 00:43:37,540
TRAVIS: I just want to see what it is!

681
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,438
ASHLEY: I slam it shut with my gauntlets.

682
00:43:40,438 --> 00:43:41,744
TRAVIS: Hey, pushy!

683
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:45,542
ASHLEY: We don't know what that was! Well, maybe
you do, but I don't know.

684
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:47,733
MARISHA: I'm assuming that was Vorugal.

685
00:43:47,733 --> 00:43:50,432
SAM: The dragon.

686
00:43:50,432 --> 00:43:53,389
TRAVIS: It's a dragon.

687
00:43:53,389 --> 00:43:54,790
ASHLEY: It's a dragon!

688
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:57,442
TRAVIS: Yeah, a big white dragon.

689
00:43:57,442 --> 00:44:00,079
MARISHA: Big white. Big dummy dragon.

690
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,028
TRAVIS: And you let it know we're here!
(chuckles)

691
00:44:03,028 --> 00:44:10,993
ASHLEY: Well, that was an accident. I was going to
surprise you guys. And we almost died.

692
00:44:10,993 --> 00:44:14,256
TRAVIS: But hey, we're not, so we need to get some
sleep, right?

693
00:44:14,256 --> 00:44:15,574
SAM: Yes, everyone sleep now.

694
00:44:15,574 --> 00:44:17,020
TRAVIS: We sleep.

695
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,836
MATT: Okay. You guys all go to rest?

696
00:44:18,836 --> 00:44:19,645
TRAVIS: Yes.

697
00:44:19,645 --> 00:44:25,928
MATT: All right. A full rest is taken for all of
you. Everyone's healed back to full. Spells are

698
00:44:25,928 --> 00:44:32,721
recovered. Percy, you are now down to a minus two,
I believe, penalty to your rolls.

699
00:44:32,721 --> 00:44:34,749
LIAM: Wake up and it's two in the afternoon?

700
00:44:34,749 --> 00:44:41,030
MATT: Technically, yeah. It's mid-afternoon by the
time you guys finish your full rest, except for

701
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:45,389
Percy. Percy is up before everybody else and is
pacing about the mansion by himself probably.

702
00:44:45,389 --> 00:44:51,705
SAM: The mansion will last 24 hours, so it'll be
dark again by the time it wears off, so we can

703
00:44:51,705 --> 00:44:53,626
stay in here as long as we need to.

704
00:44:53,626 --> 00:44:54,923
LIAM: All right.

705
00:44:54,923 --> 00:44:58,775
SAM: But do we have things we need to accomplish
today?

706
00:44:58,775 --> 00:45:08,347
TALIESIN: How about making a quiet cavern, not too
far away from the summoning circle, where we can hide?

707
00:45:08,347 --> 00:45:10,189
LAURA: That might be smart, actually.

708
00:45:10,189 --> 00:45:18,626
MARISHA: At the pace in which that cliff fell
apart last night, I don't know about the structure

709
00:45:18,626 --> 00:45:20,157
of the topography here.

710
00:45:20,157 --> 00:45:21,471
TALIESIN: That's fair.

711
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:25,913
LAURA: But we're also up high and the ravine is down
low. That could make a difference.

712
00:45:25,913 --> 00:45:29,108
LIAM: Yeah, we could get piled on.

713
00:45:29,108 --> 00:45:30,904
LAURA: Oh! I understand.

714
00:45:30,904 --> 00:45:38,585
SAM: But with Percival's engineering skills, he
could maybe find a good little spot of granite for

715
00:45:38,585 --> 00:45:40,432
you to dig into or something.

716
00:45:40,432 --> 00:45:44,002
MARISHA: I can try and do a Commune With Nature
and see.

717
00:45:44,002 --> 00:45:48,596
TRAVIS: These islands float, right?

718
00:45:48,596 --> 00:45:54,801
MATT: Oh, they once did. All the islands of
Draconia were disabled, the arcane essence that

719
00:45:54,801 --> 00:45:57,375
let them stay up, and they all crashed into the
ravine.

720
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:06,702
LIAM: Also, when shit goes down, we don't want to
repeat the mistakes of the past. A) we don't want

721
00:46:06,702 --> 00:46:09,020
to teleport inside the dragon's belly.

722
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:12,087
SAM: I'm keeping all options on the table.

723
00:46:12,087 --> 00:46:13,606
TRAVIS: Only stupid people do that.

724
00:46:13,606 --> 00:46:17,008
LIAM: Clearly. B) We don't all want to be all
grouped together.

725
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:18,487
LAURA: We don't want that.

726
00:46:18,487 --> 00:46:22,423
LIAM: I'm eating one of these magic candies.

727
00:46:22,423 --> 00:46:23,505
LAURA: Those chicken candies?

728
00:46:23,505 --> 00:46:30,454
LIAM: Yes, there's chicken. We want to spread out
so we're not all blasted at the same time.

729
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,319
TALIESIN: Vex and I at a distance.

730
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:35,779
LIAM: Separately, though, so you can hit from
different angles.

731
00:46:35,779 --> 00:46:42,265
TRAVIS: So two caves? Four caves?

732
00:46:42,265 --> 00:46:46,701
MARISHA: I'll have to think on the caves.

733
00:46:46,701 --> 00:46:54,035
SAM: They don't have to be giant caverns. It's
just a little nook. A little foxhole.

734
00:46:54,035 --> 00:46:58,289
LIAM: Cubby-holes. Up high for anyone who can take
to the air, down low for anyone who can't.

735
00:46:58,289 --> 00:47:02,616
MARISHA: Honestly, I'm not going to know a whole
lot until we scout out the location.

736
00:47:02,616 --> 00:47:04,256
TALIESIN: Let's go scout out the location.

737
00:47:04,256 --> 00:47:05,944
SAM: Okay, how do we do that? In broad daylight.

738
00:47:05,944 --> 00:47:11,534
MARISHA: I've got something I've never done
before!

739
00:47:11,534 --> 00:47:13,189
LAURA: What is this?

740
00:47:13,189 --> 00:47:16,296
SAM: It's called Invisible Reconnaissance.

741
00:47:16,296 --> 00:47:25,969
MARISHA: Almost. It's called Animal Shapes. And
it's basically Polymorph, but for all of us. I can

742
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:27,660
turn us all into whatever we want.

743
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,095
LAURA: So we don't just look like cows.

744
00:47:29,095 --> 00:47:30,765
LAURA and MARISHA: We <i>are</i> cows.

745
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:35,290
TRAVIS: Quick question. In all of our time here,
when we were scouting before, and when you two

746
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:39,244
jokers were going to go see Tooma, did we see a
bunch of animals around?

747
00:47:39,244 --> 00:47:42,669
LAURA: I have not seen very many animals, I don't
think.

748
00:47:42,669 --> 00:47:49,297
MATT: Within the ravine, there's been very few.
What animals you have seen have been a few flying

749
00:47:49,297 --> 00:48:00,964
owls, other carnivorous birds that are generally
scavengers. You've seen maybe a few small wolves

750
00:48:00,964 --> 00:48:04,659
that are picking through the ruins and eventually
scattered off. White snow wolves.

751
00:48:04,659 --> 00:48:14,456
TRAVIS: As long as being animals isn't going to
make us a mid-day snack, versus being Ravenites.

752
00:48:14,456 --> 00:48:22,435
SAM: I will say this: I love the sound of this
spell, but wouldn't travelling mist be really

753
00:48:22,435 --> 00:48:25,324
undetectable? Could we mist around?

754
00:48:25,324 --> 00:48:31,951
MARISHA: It's almost debatable. Because we look
like an unnatural mist.

755
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:35,783
SAM: There's a snowstorm out there. We're just
going to be one with the clouds.

756
00:48:35,783 --> 00:48:37,455
LAURA: Is there a snowstorm?

757
00:48:37,455 --> 00:48:43,415
MATT: If you guys glance outside of the mansion
and look, it is not a snowstorm, but there are

758
00:48:43,415 --> 00:48:52,036
heavy winds. (wind blowing) You can hear
multitudes, a cacophony of off-harmonies of winds,

759
00:48:52,036 --> 00:48:57,577
of different portions of the distant ravine that
are all howling together. There is a faint

760
00:48:57,577 --> 00:49:01,156
snowfall, but the clouds are dark and heavy, and
more of a storm coming your way.

761
00:49:01,156 --> 00:49:04,596
LAURA: Does snow get thrown up to the wind?

762
00:49:04,596 --> 00:49:07,808
MATT: A little further down in the ravine, it
does.

763
00:49:07,808 --> 00:49:11,572
LIAM: And as long as we're not synchronized
swimming in mist form and spread out, then it

764
00:49:11,572 --> 00:49:12,704
should be fine.

765
00:49:12,704 --> 00:49:14,403
LAURA: Behave like wind, you guys.

766
00:49:14,403 --> 00:49:18,507
TRAVIS: Can we do both animals and the mist?

767
00:49:18,507 --> 00:49:21,394
MATT: No, they both require concentration.

768
00:49:21,394 --> 00:49:26,210
SAM: My worry about animals is don't we also have
the intellect of the animals that we become?

769
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:31,329
MATT: Actually, Wind Walk is not concentration. In
theory, you could do both. Wind Walk is not

770
00:49:31,329 --> 00:49:32,538
concentration.

771
00:49:32,538 --> 00:49:34,434
MARISHA: We can be misty animals?

772
00:49:34,434 --> 00:49:35,829
MATT: You can be misty animals.

773
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:37,152
MARISHA: That's dumb.

774
00:49:37,152 --> 00:49:39,635
(laughter)

775
00:49:39,635 --> 00:49:41,662
MARISHA: That's a lot.

776
00:49:41,662 --> 00:49:44,991
SAM: So we keep our own intellect?

777
00:49:44,991 --> 00:49:49,668
MARISHA: We always keep our intellect. Animal
Shapes last for 24 hours.

778
00:49:49,668 --> 00:49:53,202
TALIESIN: Can you go back and forth?

779
00:49:53,202 --> 00:49:55,027
MARISHA: I'm going to find that out right now.

780
00:49:55,027 --> 00:49:56,337
TALIESIN: That's a question.

781
00:49:56,337 --> 00:50:02,652
MARISHA: Because if we were a flock of birds,
Vorugal's not going to give a shit about birds.

782
00:50:02,652 --> 00:50:08,481
SAM: A flock of hawks, they don't go together. But
a flock of pigeons do, or a flock of geese.

783
00:50:08,481 --> 00:50:10,549
TALIESIN: I don't want to be food. I want to be
something that eats.

784
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:15,259
LIAM: While they're debating, I pull Whisper out,
and I chuck it into a wall and teleport to it. I

785
00:50:15,259 --> 00:50:17,329
pulled it out of the Blink-Back Belt.

786
00:50:17,329 --> 00:50:23,860
MATT: Yeah. So you chuck the dagger. As you're
talking, you watch as Vax takes the blade, flings

787
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:29,106
it across the room. It slams into the side of the
foyer. You look back to where he was, and he's not

788
00:50:29,106 --> 00:50:34,154
there anymore. There's a flash of dark shadow
energy where the blade is, and Vax's form appears

789
00:50:34,154 --> 00:50:36,819
right there, holding the blade where it landed in
the wall.

790
00:50:36,819 --> 00:50:38,916
LAURA: That is so cool!

791
00:50:38,916 --> 00:50:42,755
LIAM: It didn't go into my belt. I went into the
wall, and I'm holding it, still. I was a shadow

792
00:50:42,755 --> 00:50:50,568
for half a second, and I traveled with the blade.
I am fucking Nightcrawler. Holy shit. And I throw

793
00:50:50,568 --> 00:50:52,789
it again across the other side.

794
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:56,465
MATT: Okay. This time make an attack roll because
you're excited, not concentrating.

795
00:50:56,465 --> 00:50:58,428
LIAM: Okay. Sure, that's 27.

796
00:50:58,428 --> 00:51:03,430
MATT: Yeah. It goes a little more elevated, lands
about ten feet up. As it impacts, you guys watch.

797
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:08,836
As he releases the blade, his form almost is
pulled along, almost like it's caught on a tether

798
00:51:08,836 --> 00:51:12,972
and then just turns into dark smoke and vanishes
with the blade. As the blade sticks into the wall,

799
00:51:12,972 --> 00:51:17,210
he reappears at the side, clutching the edge, and
you drop a few feet and land onto your feet.

800
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:21,482
LIAM: Aw, suck it haters! This is the coolest
dagger I've ever had!

801
00:51:21,482 --> 00:51:26,880
SAM: Tell me this, can you not do that? If you
throw it and don't want to travel where it is?

802
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,454
LIAM: I throw it right next to his head, and I
don't go anywhere.

803
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:31,878
MATT: Roll an attack roll.

804
00:51:31,878 --> 00:51:33,632
SAM: Go right in my neck.

805
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:35,184
LIAM: 24?

806
00:51:35,184 --> 00:51:37,651
MATT: 24. (dagger impact) Right next to him.

807
00:51:37,651 --> 00:51:39,057
LIAM: Does it go to my belt?

808
00:51:39,057 --> 00:51:40,342
MATT: It returns to your belt.

809
00:51:40,342 --> 00:51:42,030
SAM: Oh! You get to choose?

810
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:44,015
MARISHA: That is awesome.

811
00:51:44,015 --> 00:51:47,948
SAM: Maybe don't ever do that again, please.

812
00:51:47,948 --> 00:51:53,107
LAURA: Sure you're okay, Grog, that you don't have
the dagger? I know you wanted it.

813
00:51:53,107 --> 00:51:56,238
TRAVIS: I just want to be able to move faster, but
it's all right.

814
00:51:56,238 --> 00:52:01,741
LIAM: We can't all be all things, Grog. You are
the strongest thing on the planet. You are going

815
00:52:01,741 --> 00:52:04,073
to take Vorugal all by yourself--

816
00:52:04,073 --> 00:52:05,850
TRAVIS: Yeah, if I can get next to him.

817
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:07,499
LAURA: Which he probably can't.

818
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:12,735
LIAM: You shut the fuck up, you trouble-maker. You
bust my balls on a daily basis. What is that

819
00:52:12,735 --> 00:52:15,978
about? What is that about? What have I ever done
but support you?

820
00:52:15,978 --> 00:52:22,028
TRAVIS: Pipe down! Calm down! Listen, how are we
getting down there? Can we hurry this up, please?

821
00:52:22,028 --> 00:52:24,620
LIAM: Throw my dagger at the ceiling. Travel with
it.

822
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:31,488
MATT: All right, so you watch his form vanish
again. About 40 feet up, (impact).

823
00:52:31,488 --> 00:52:33,989
LIAM: Can I land on my sister?

824
00:52:33,989 --> 00:52:35,530
LAURA: On me?!

825
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:40,655
MATT: Make a dexterity saving throw. This would be
acrobatics, right.

826
00:52:40,655 --> 00:52:42,276
LAURA: What about me?

827
00:52:42,276 --> 00:52:44,443
MATT: Make a perception check.

828
00:52:44,443 --> 00:52:46,976
LAURA: I was looking straight at him.

829
00:52:46,976 --> 00:52:48,350
LIAM: I rolled a 27.

830
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:50,710
LAURA: Perception? 20.

831
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,403
MATT: You make a dexterity saving throw.

832
00:52:52,403 --> 00:52:54,907
LAURA: (sighs) You piece of shit.

833
00:52:54,907 --> 00:52:56,671
LIAM: Quit starting with me.

834
00:52:56,671 --> 00:53:00,639
LAURA: Dexterity. 28! 30!

835
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:01,934
LIAM: 30. She beat me.

836
00:53:01,934 --> 00:53:05,550
MATT: She dodges right out of the way, and you
slam onto the ground. You feel your ankles and

837
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:10,242
knees (ping) a little bit. That sharp pain hits
you in both joints and you're like (moans).

838
00:53:10,242 --> 00:53:13,339
LIAM: Worth it. (groans)

839
00:53:13,339 --> 00:53:16,284
MARISHA: So anyway. Back to the plan--

840
00:53:16,284 --> 00:53:21,368
(laughter)

841
00:53:21,368 --> 00:53:26,381
MARISHA: So with Animal Shapes, I can actually
decide what animals each of you can be, so we can

842
00:53:26,381 --> 00:53:33,939
all be different animals. Furthermore, on my
action, I can use it to transform you guys into a

843
00:53:33,939 --> 00:53:35,527
different creature.

844
00:53:35,527 --> 00:53:36,648
LAURA: That's pretty cool.

845
00:53:36,648 --> 00:53:38,289
LIAM: I like how excited you are about this.

846
00:53:38,289 --> 00:53:39,430
MARISHA: I'm so excited.

847
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:45,588
LAURA: I'm wondering if the mist form would not be
better. But the animals are really cool.

848
00:53:45,588 --> 00:53:48,201
TALIESIN: Can we go in and out of mist form?
That's a thing we can do?

849
00:53:48,201 --> 00:53:49,746
SAM: It takes a while, but yes.

850
00:53:49,746 --> 00:53:54,777
LIAM: But we're not in the middle of a fight,
hopefully. The animals, Kiki, save it for a rainy day?

851
00:53:54,777 --> 00:53:56,405
MARISHA: All right.

852
00:53:56,405 --> 00:53:58,110
LAURA: If we're not all dead come tomorrow.

853
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:01,561
LIAM: Yeah, we probably all will be dead tomorrow,
but it's a really cool idea.

854
00:54:01,561 --> 00:54:04,124
MARISHA: Thank you for your validation.

855
00:54:04,124 --> 00:54:12,910
SAM: Two questions. Are we all going? And question
two, when we get there and find a suitable

856
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:17,767
location for carving caves, are you going to do
this right now, or are we just scouting?

857
00:54:17,767 --> 00:54:19,491
TALIESIN: We're going to do this, as well.

858
00:54:19,491 --> 00:54:21,002
SAM: We're going to do this right now?

859
00:54:21,002 --> 00:54:22,535
MARISHA: I imagine it depends on how scouting goes.

860
00:54:22,535 --> 00:54:28,439
SAM: Well, we can't communicate when we're in mist
form, so you just have to go do if you feel it.

861
00:54:28,439 --> 00:54:36,945
LAURA: Maybe scout and then go back. Because mist
form stays for eight hours, so at least that way

862
00:54:36,945 --> 00:54:39,551
we can communicate not next to Vorugal.

863
00:54:39,551 --> 00:54:43,160
TALIESIN: If we scout and it's clear, and then we
come back and then go back, it might not be clear

864
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,403
again. If we scout and it's clear, then we do it.
It's done.

865
00:54:46,403 --> 00:54:50,309
MATT: You guys hear this faint gargling sound as
Grog is currently gargling his own spit and

866
00:54:50,309 --> 00:54:52,302
staring at the ceiling.

867
00:54:52,302 --> 00:54:57,111
LIAM: I didn't follow that, either. We should do
something.

868
00:54:57,111 --> 00:55:00,185
MARISHA: All right, let's go scout. I cast Wind
Walk on everybody.

869
00:55:00,185 --> 00:55:07,112
MATT: Okay. All of you begin to feel your form
buzz a little bit with the instilled power of

870
00:55:07,112 --> 00:55:13,184
wind. As you all each step out onto the snow on
the outside of the mansion, you can concentrate

871
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:18,767
for a moment as your form then meshes into a
mist-like billowing cloud.

872
00:55:18,767 --> 00:55:21,037
LAURA: Do we look natural?

873
00:55:21,037 --> 00:55:22,747
SAM: Yeah, what do we look like?

874
00:55:22,747 --> 00:55:24,424
LAURA: Do we look pretty obvious?

875
00:55:24,424 --> 00:55:27,054
SAM: Are we a yellow cloud, a white cloud?

876
00:55:27,054 --> 00:55:30,971
MATT: I'd say it's more of a whitish cloud. I
wouldn't say it's supremely obvious right now, but

877
00:55:30,971 --> 00:55:37,289
the wind is pushing you about a little bit. If you
try and focus direction of move, you can get a

878
00:55:37,289 --> 00:55:39,053
better idea how well your movement is.

879
00:55:39,053 --> 00:55:42,446
TALIESIN: I'm trying to move in a very windy way,
yeah.

880
00:55:42,446 --> 00:55:43,704
TRAVIS: And Kima is with us?

881
00:55:43,704 --> 00:55:45,036
MATT: Kima is with you, yeah.

882
00:55:45,036 --> 00:55:47,474
LIAM and TALIESIN: I am the fart.

883
00:55:47,474 --> 00:55:57,540
MATT: Kima, as you guys are doing this and it gets
cast, Kima goes, "So what am I doing?"

884
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:02,495
MARISHA: Do you want to come scout? We're going to
scout. Or you can just stay.

885
00:56:02,495 --> 00:56:06,612
MATT: "You know, I'm going to stay. You've got a
big kitchen here."

886
00:56:06,612 --> 00:56:09,686
MARISHA: It's mainly filled with chicken.

887
00:56:09,686 --> 00:56:11,809
MATT: "I love chicken."

888
00:56:11,809 --> 00:56:13,653
(laughter)

889
00:56:13,653 --> 00:56:18,749
TRAVIS: There's also a training room several
levels down if you want to go smash some shit.

890
00:56:18,749 --> 00:56:21,270
MATT: "I'm going to get some chicken, and I'm
going to go smash some shit."

891
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:23,623
MARISHA: And there's the spa under that.

892
00:56:23,623 --> 00:56:28,272
MATT: "I don't think I've been to a spa. Does that
also have chicken?"

893
00:56:28,272 --> 00:56:30,208
LAURA: It could if you wanted it to.

894
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:31,722
ASHLEY: You could bring it down there.

895
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:33,511
MATT: "This is the best place ever!"

896
00:56:33,511 --> 00:56:34,933
SAM: It is. It really is.

897
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:43,450
MATT: "Come back when you need me." She goes and
runs off to the kitchen area. All right. You guys,

898
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:50,932
stepping out, keeping the focus on the spell, you
move half-speed through this weather in mist form.

899
00:56:50,932 --> 00:56:58,239
So your 300 feet per round speed, whatever it is,
is reduced to a mere 150 feet.

900
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:03,041
MARISHA: It's okay. It's more for appearance.

901
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:07,988
MATT: What are you guys doing? Are you coasting
through the ravine, are you heading directly, or

902
00:57:07,988 --> 00:57:09,204
trying to go overhead?

903
00:57:09,204 --> 00:57:13,180
MARISHA: I want to go to the summoning stone. I'm going
towards there.

904
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:17,764
SAM: But we discussed before we left that we would
mainly stick to the lowlands and the ravine to get

905
00:57:17,764 --> 00:57:18,878
there, yeah?

906
00:57:18,878 --> 00:57:19,967
LAURA: Yes, we did.

907
00:57:19,967 --> 00:57:21,598
TALIESIN: Hugging the walls, looking normal.

908
00:57:21,598 --> 00:57:23,232
MARISHA: Sure. I follow the crowd.

909
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:24,854
MATT: Okay. Who's leading?

910
00:57:24,854 --> 00:57:26,383
ASHLEY: I am!

911
00:57:26,383 --> 00:57:29,111
(laughter)

912
00:57:29,111 --> 00:57:30,365
LAURA: I'll lead the way.

913
00:57:30,365 --> 00:57:33,005
LIAM: This is the quietest you've ever been.

914
00:57:33,005 --> 00:57:36,050
TALIESIN: I volunteer as tribute!

915
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:41,511
SAM: Shouldn't Laura lead?

916
00:57:41,511 --> 00:57:43,523
TALIESIN: Let Laura lead.

917
00:57:43,523 --> 00:57:45,902
MATT: Okay. So Vex and Pike are leading the way.

918
00:57:45,902 --> 00:57:47,177
ASHLEY: No, I was kidding.

919
00:57:47,177 --> 00:57:49,085
TALIESIN: Too late. No take-backs.

920
00:57:49,085 --> 00:57:52,020
TRAVIS: We all die together.

921
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:58,606
MATT: As you guys slowly drift down into the
bottom of the ravine on the outside of where the

922
00:57:58,606 --> 00:58:04,332
mansion doorway is, you crest down to where a
large portion of the rubble is currently buried by

923
00:58:04,332 --> 00:58:08,518
snow and ice. The wind is whipping snow up into
the air, and you're finding little spirals and

924
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:14,274
little snow devils that are making their way
through as different clusters of wind tend to

925
00:58:14,274 --> 00:58:18,078
swell and subside. You make your way over to the
opposite side of the ravine and start heading to

926
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:19,665
the north way, crawling around.

927
00:58:19,665 --> 00:58:22,164
LAURA: I'm going to keep an eye out to make sure
nobody seems like they're-- especially towards

928
00:58:22,164 --> 00:58:24,514
Vorugal's plateau to make sure he's not there.

929
00:58:24,514 --> 00:58:28,250
MATT: Need you to go ahead and make a perception
check if you could. And I need everybody to make a

930
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:29,686
stealth check, please.

931
00:58:29,686 --> 00:58:32,676
MARISHA: Do we get some sort of bonus because
we're mist?

932
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:35,476
LAURA: Perception is 30.

933
00:58:35,476 --> 00:58:38,483
MARISHA: Jesus.

934
00:58:38,483 --> 00:58:41,694
ASHLEY: How can you be loud as mist?

935
00:58:41,694 --> 00:58:43,376
LIAM: Natural 20!

936
00:58:43,376 --> 00:58:45,288
MARISHA: Stealth and what?

937
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:46,643
TALIESIN: Just stealth for us.

938
00:58:46,643 --> 00:58:48,701
SAM: Do I get to add Jack of all--

939
00:58:48,701 --> 00:58:51,947
MATT: You can. As long as you're not trained in
it, you can add it to it.

940
00:58:51,947 --> 00:58:53,907
SAM: I'm not. Okay. 18.

941
00:58:53,907 --> 00:58:55,137
TALIESIN: 16.

942
00:58:55,137 --> 00:58:56,024
MARISHA: 14.

943
00:58:56,024 --> 00:58:57,103
MATT: 20.

944
00:58:57,103 --> 00:58:58,021
LAURA: 15.

945
00:58:58,021 --> 00:58:59,043
ASHLEY: Eight.

946
00:58:59,043 --> 00:59:00,197
TRAVIS: Four.

947
00:59:00,197 --> 00:59:04,846
MATT: Okay. It's fine. It's a group check, so
successes outweigh the failures. You guys as a

948
00:59:04,846 --> 00:59:10,695
group begin to move forward. It's fine. As you
guys are slowly moving your way, you keep an eye

949
00:59:10,695 --> 00:59:16,326
out. You can see there are some Ravenites in
clusters that are out, currently poring through

950
00:59:16,326 --> 00:59:20,074
the rubble. There are crews that are basically
excavating, trying to pull out what's worth

951
00:59:20,074 --> 00:59:22,347
anything from the remnants of Draconia.

952
00:59:22,347 --> 00:59:30,778
You make your way around this large, familiar
curvature from before that leads towards the

953
00:59:30,778 --> 00:59:38,176
center area of Vorugal's now-claimed lair at the
bottom of the ravine. As you turn the corner and

954
00:59:38,176 --> 00:59:42,881
you guys keep watch, you can see on the icy
platform, with these spikes that jut out at

955
00:59:42,881 --> 00:59:48,529
various places throughout this larger central area
here. On top, you can see perched and curled up

956
00:59:48,529 --> 00:59:55,223
the massive form of the white dragon itself, claws
curled up under its chin, its chin slightly turned

957
00:59:55,223 --> 01:00:02,627
askew to the left, eyes closed, wings wrapped up
around and gently flapping over the sides of the

958
01:00:02,627 --> 01:00:08,946
top of this icy platform. It sits there quietly,
breathing in, and you can hear the breath itself,

959
01:00:08,946 --> 01:00:24,593
deep and guttural, just echoing. (snoring) The
wind occasionally sneaks in and seems to almost

960
01:00:24,593 --> 01:00:30,967
carry the echo farther than it should be audible.
And you can see there are two packs of about five

961
01:00:30,967 --> 01:00:37,044
Ravenites that are armed and are sitting at the
base of the platform, that are looking out. Some

962
01:00:37,044 --> 01:00:40,722
of them are sitting, some of them are eating some
small rations, some are just keeping an eye out.

963
01:00:40,722 --> 01:00:49,864
These appear to be essentially assigned guards to
Vorugal here at his lair. So. You guys continue past?

964
01:00:49,864 --> 01:00:51,405
TALIESIN: Oh yes.

965
01:00:51,405 --> 01:00:52,857
MATT: Heading which direction?

966
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:54,174
LAURA: Towards the summoning circle.

967
01:00:54,174 --> 01:00:55,653
MATT: You recall which direction that was?

968
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:57,123
LIAM: It's east.

969
01:00:57,123 --> 01:01:02,207
MATT: All right, so you head a little northward,
following the curvature of this part of the ravine

970
01:01:02,207 --> 01:01:09,626
in an eastward direction. Eventually, you all move
past an uncomfortable proximity of about 200 to

971
01:01:09,626 --> 01:01:16,971
300 feet of Vorugal, seemingly not catching
anyone's attention as you slowly move, following

972
01:01:16,971 --> 01:01:20,642
the pattern of winds. It takes you a little longer
to get through, but you figure it's best to look

973
01:01:20,642 --> 01:01:23,972
as natural as possible with the moving terrain and
weather.

974
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:29,258
Eventually, you turn around and begin making your
way eastward, away, following where two more

975
01:01:29,258 --> 01:01:40,264
portions of the ravine clump together. Anywhere
between 80 to 100 feet in width, it expands a bit,

976
01:01:40,264 --> 01:01:47,526
shrinks in a bit, but it seems to be pushing into
a very slight grade upward, like this portion of

977
01:01:47,526 --> 01:01:55,176
the ravine is making its way, over probably the
next mile or so, to breach and hit surface.

978
01:01:55,176 --> 01:01:56,796
LIAM: So from Vorugal?

979
01:01:56,796 --> 01:02:04,016
MATT: From Vorugal, heading eastward, it is slowly
heading up. You get about a quarter-mile in

980
01:02:04,016 --> 01:02:13,857
before you begin to see the very thick ice being
broken by occasional snow-covered dead trees that

981
01:02:13,857 --> 01:02:19,071
are breaking through. As you saw before, there are
not a lot of trees in this central area of the

982
01:02:19,071 --> 01:02:23,065
ravine, but they're becoming a little more common
as you progress forward, though many of them dead,

983
01:02:23,065 --> 01:02:29,752
thin and broken in places. Make another perception
check, Laura.

984
01:02:29,752 --> 01:02:36,806
LAURA: Okay. 16.

985
01:02:36,806 --> 01:02:44,105
MATT: Okay. It's fine. Pushing forward in your
mist form, you do see that certain portions of the

986
01:02:44,105 --> 01:02:49,981
upper ravine have an element of erosion to them
that have broken down, and there are some large

987
01:02:49,981 --> 01:02:57,609
stones that have dropped and are jutting out of
the ice formation on the snowy platform floor. You

988
01:02:57,609 --> 01:03:05,361
glance around, and you can see that there are a
loose circle of maybe five, six stones forming an

989
01:03:05,361 --> 01:03:10,819
oval shape in the center. And even looking about,
you can see this area seems to have seen some

990
01:03:10,819 --> 01:03:19,468
scuffles. It looks like portions of the walls have
been scraped and clawed apart. It looks like some

991
01:03:19,468 --> 01:03:26,378
heavy impacts have hit the side. If there was a
place for there to be a setting ground for some

992
01:03:26,378 --> 01:03:34,667
sort of a conflict of previous hunts for Vorugal,
this is probably what Tooma was referring to.

993
01:03:34,667 --> 01:03:41,316
LAURA: I look down towards it. Does it look like
anything is around it?

994
01:03:41,316 --> 01:03:44,893
MATT: Currently, no. It looks pretty--

995
01:03:44,893 --> 01:03:46,851
LAURA and SAM: Ooh.

996
01:03:46,851 --> 01:03:48,989
LAURA: Oh no! Tree's down!

997
01:03:48,989 --> 01:03:55,137
LIAM: It's an earthquake. The trees fell down!
Keyleth! Your spells are too powerful!

998
01:03:55,137 --> 01:03:58,610
MARISHA: (laughs) I can save them! I can save them
all!

999
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:01,663
SAM: Wow, Matt.

1000
01:04:01,663 --> 01:04:03,662
ASHLEY: It's so pretty!

1001
01:04:03,662 --> 01:04:06,364
LAURA: It is so pretty.

1002
01:04:06,364 --> 01:04:08,086
MATT: This circle of stones here--

1003
01:04:08,086 --> 01:04:09,596
ASHLEY: Did you make the--

1004
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:11,191
SAM: It's Arendelle!

1005
01:04:11,191 --> 01:04:12,658
LIAM: He's been carving it this week.

1006
01:04:12,658 --> 01:04:17,925
MATT: So this circle of stones, the clusters of
rock that have broken down and are sticking out,

1007
01:04:17,925 --> 01:04:22,733
you don't know what the cultural significance of
them are. They appear to have been there for a

1008
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:29,592
long time; these were not a recent series of
landmarks that were presented here. These have

1009
01:04:29,592 --> 01:04:34,474
been here for a while. But you do see a series of
claw marks and damaged bits throughout the space

1010
01:04:34,474 --> 01:04:38,533
in the area that is uncharacteristic of the rest
of the ravine floor that you've been traversing.

1011
01:04:38,533 --> 01:04:47,660
SAM: Can Vorugal see this spot?

1012
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:51,425
LIAM: Curved away?

1013
01:04:51,425 --> 01:04:53,370
MATT: You make a perception check, Scanlan.

1014
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:54,863
SAM: Oh, I'm great at those.

1015
01:04:54,863 --> 01:04:56,478
LIAM: We just traveled about a half-mile?

1016
01:04:56,478 --> 01:04:57,853
SAM: Six!

1017
01:04:57,853 --> 01:05:01,475
MATT: About a quarter mile. You don't see Vorugal
from here, so probably not.

1018
01:05:01,475 --> 01:05:04,296
LAURA: I would be looking for Vorugal too,
though.

1019
01:05:04,296 --> 01:05:06,616
MATT: Perception check.

1020
01:05:06,616 --> 01:05:10,499
LAURA: Natural 20.

1021
01:05:10,499 --> 01:05:18,196
MATT: From this perspective, it's a little ways in
the way the ravine has crawled in this

1022
01:05:18,196 --> 01:05:24,551
northeastern direction from where the lair center
was. This area is not directly visible from

1023
01:05:24,551 --> 01:05:28,689
Vorugal. You cannot see, for quite a bit, that
area.

1024
01:05:28,689 --> 01:05:30,699
LIAM: Wind fingers for Vorugal.

1025
01:05:30,699 --> 01:05:36,149
LAURA: All right. Can I float down and get a
closer look at the weird marks you were talking about?

1026
01:05:36,149 --> 01:05:38,329
MATT: Yeah. Make an investigation check.

1027
01:05:38,329 --> 01:05:42,856
SAM: While she's doing that, I'm going to fly
through Pike a few times.

1028
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:46,836
LAURA: 13.

1029
01:05:46,836 --> 01:05:59,096
MATT: It tickles. But not in a good way. Glancing
about, you can see there is some snowfall here and

1030
01:05:59,096 --> 01:06:04,751
some ice that has sealed off this area. A lot of
the snow that's hit here gets blown away by the

1031
01:06:04,751 --> 01:06:10,403
wind that's coming through, so there hasn't been a
lot of snow packed in this vicinity. A lot of

1032
01:06:10,403 --> 01:06:16,465
these large claw marks are indicative of dragon
claws, especially those of an ancient size. You do

1033
01:06:16,465 --> 01:06:23,025
see bones scattered about-- many of them have been
picked clean-- of varying sizes. There appears to

1034
01:06:23,025 --> 01:06:35,097
be a half-eaten large insect-like carapace that's
shoved off to the side. A number of creatures

1035
01:06:35,097 --> 01:06:38,690
have fallen here and have been mostly eaten,
devoured, or left to be picked apart by the other

1036
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:41,209
birds of prey that exist in this area.

1037
01:06:41,209 --> 01:06:52,681
TALIESIN: We have cover from either side of the
top. That's right. I'm going to fly over to the

1038
01:06:52,681 --> 01:06:54,900
top of the far right of the ravine.

1039
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:57,040
LAURA: Behind those rocks right there?

1040
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:05,367
TALIESIN: Above them, all the way up here. And I'm
going to take a look around and see if anybody,

1041
01:07:05,367 --> 01:07:08,136
anything's around, anything living that looks
suspicious.

1042
01:07:08,136 --> 01:07:10,030
MATT: Perception check.

1043
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:20,086
TALIESIN: You'd think I'd be able to do this. 18.

1044
01:07:20,086 --> 01:07:28,956
MATT: Okay. Glancing about, you can see every now
and then, a few birds fly overhead. Appear to be

1045
01:07:28,956 --> 01:07:38,172
hawks, light gray in color. They're just looking
around, circling and vanishing in the distance. You

1046
01:07:38,172 --> 01:07:44,490
do see a few small furred critters; looks almost
squirrel-like, but it's too far away to make out

1047
01:07:44,490 --> 01:07:52,837
the details, and you're not very
specifically detailed-- make a nature check, actually.

1048
01:07:52,837 --> 01:07:55,099
LIAM: Check for critters.

1049
01:07:55,099 --> 01:07:56,665
TALIESIN: Nine.

1050
01:07:56,665 --> 01:08:00,038
MATT: You have no idea. It's furred, it's small.
It probably creeps you out a little.

1051
01:08:00,038 --> 01:08:03,000
MARISHA: (giggles) My friends.

1052
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:11,815
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to survey. Would I think
it's safer above the ravine or within?

1053
01:08:11,815 --> 01:08:22,001
MATT: I'd say within here, it's probably safer
within the ravine, up at the top. This is not

1054
01:08:22,001 --> 01:08:26,165
indicative of the true height; we'll say this is
more of an example. The ravine height is probably

1055
01:08:26,165 --> 01:08:28,826
closer to maybe 80 to 100 feet up.

1056
01:08:28,826 --> 01:08:30,480
TRAVIS: Yeah. Got it.

1057
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:33,100
MATT: I just didn't want to build Styrofoam that
high.

1058
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:38,977
TALIESIN: Actually, that works out perfectly for
me. Then I'll jump down to behind that rock and I

1059
01:08:38,977 --> 01:08:41,483
will de-mist behind that rock.

1060
01:08:41,483 --> 01:08:42,870
MATT: Okay.

1061
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:46,040
SAM: I'll see him doing that and join him.

1062
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:48,307
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll watch as they do that.

1063
01:08:48,307 --> 01:08:55,749
TALIESIN: I think a cave entrance right here to
somewhere where you can hide after you do the

1064
01:08:55,749 --> 01:09:00,668
summoning and dive in and get about 25 to 30 feet
away.

1065
01:09:00,668 --> 01:09:04,865
SAM: Question, Percy. There's this annoying wind.

1066
01:09:04,865 --> 01:09:06,730
(laughter)

1067
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:08,861
LIAM: Vax flies around them.

1068
01:09:08,861 --> 01:09:11,467
TALIESIN: I'm not responsible for what you ate for
breakfast.

1069
01:09:11,467 --> 01:09:16,300
SAM: Here's a question. Rather than scouting here,
digging a hole, and going back to our mansion,

1070
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,222
should we just have a new mansion here?

1071
01:09:18,222 --> 01:09:20,667
TALIESIN: Yes, that's actually-- well. Kima.

1072
01:09:20,667 --> 01:09:22,052
SAM: Kima.

1073
01:09:22,052 --> 01:09:25,357
TALIESIN: That's all right. Somebody can mist back
and bring her.

1074
01:09:25,357 --> 01:09:29,986
SAM: I could technically drop that mansion and
she'd be on her ass. (laughs)

1075
01:09:29,986 --> 01:09:37,070
TALIESIN: I think she's already so delighted with
you. That might be a terrible idea.

1076
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:40,315
SAM: Well, someone could go back and get her. We
don't have to do this right now, but when we're

1077
01:09:40,315 --> 01:09:45,679
done here, maybe we want to camp here so we have a
place to hide inside a mansion.

1078
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:48,014
TALIESIN: That's a very good idea, actually.

1079
01:09:48,014 --> 01:09:52,856
SAM: And we don't even really need to make
tunnels, do we?

1080
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:55,266
TALIESIN: We do. We want to have places to hide.

1081
01:09:55,266 --> 01:09:56,979
SAM: Yeah, that's true. We want to spread out.

1082
01:09:56,979 --> 01:09:58,722
MARISHA: I'm going to mist down next to them.

1083
01:09:58,722 --> 01:10:03,638
TALIESIN: We want to have a place to hide, and
place to shoot from that has cover.

1084
01:10:03,638 --> 01:10:05,462
MARISHA: Hey, guys. What are we talking about?

1085
01:10:05,462 --> 01:10:08,131
TALIESIN: Digging a hole and moving the mansion
here.

1086
01:10:08,131 --> 01:10:11,175
MARISHA: (laughs) God, so windy tonight.

1087
01:10:11,175 --> 01:10:12,881
SAM: I know, it's so annoying.

1088
01:10:12,881 --> 01:10:18,870
TALIESIN: It also means that if something goes
horribly wrong, you can run downstairs and hide.

1089
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:22,466
MARISHA: All right, well, here's the problem. I
need to figure out what all of this is made out

1090
01:10:22,466 --> 01:10:31,479
of. I can't work with it if it's just ice. It has to be
natural stone. So cover for me? I'm going to drop

1091
01:10:31,479 --> 01:10:33,796
down and start meditating.

1092
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:36,221
SAM: I'm going to scan the sky.

1093
01:10:36,221 --> 01:10:40,458
MARISHA: I'm going to do a Commune With Nature
spell. Do we have any other questions, before I do

1094
01:10:40,458 --> 01:10:43,078
this, that we want to ask the land?

1095
01:10:43,078 --> 01:10:44,670
TRAVIS: We're wind; you're good.

1096
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:46,058
MATT: Everything seems fine.

1097
01:10:46,058 --> 01:10:47,577
LAURA: We're still wind.

1098
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:51,342
MARISHA: In general, I guess.

1099
01:10:51,342 --> 01:10:56,301
TALIESIN: How strong are the ravine walls, and can
we dig into them, as well? Not just the ground,

1100
01:10:56,301 --> 01:10:59,675
but the walls themselves. Small tunnels, just big
enough for one person.

1101
01:10:59,675 --> 01:11:04,506
SAM: And there's these rocks here. We know there's
some rocks. We knows that there's tons of ice.

1102
01:11:04,506 --> 01:11:08,539
MARISHA: Do I need to figure out how far exactly
Vorugal is from us?

1103
01:11:08,539 --> 01:11:13,165
SAM: We saw him on the way over. We know exactly
where he is.

1104
01:11:13,165 --> 01:11:15,277
MARISHA: I have three good questions.

1105
01:11:15,277 --> 01:11:17,411
LIAM: Weather forecast is not a bad idea.

1106
01:11:17,411 --> 01:11:19,080
MARISHA: No, it's not. The weather forecast.

1107
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,477
TALIESIN: Yeah, for tomorrow.

1108
01:11:20,477 --> 01:11:23,216
SAM: What sorts of things can you ask nature?

1109
01:11:23,216 --> 01:11:27,388
MARISHA: Nature-y things. I can ask it about--

1110
01:11:27,388 --> 01:11:29,518
LIAM: Where's the closest Erewhon?

1111
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:32,587
MARISHA: Yeah. Is there a Starbucks nearby?

1112
01:11:32,587 --> 01:11:35,231
MATT: Three questions. What you got?

1113
01:11:35,231 --> 01:11:45,142
MARISHA: Oh, I was asking-- yeah. I can ask it
about topography, I can ask about locations

1114
01:11:45,142 --> 01:11:47,588
of people nearby. Things like that.

1115
01:11:47,588 --> 01:11:50,547
LAURA: Ask about what the rock is, so you can find
where to dig.

1116
01:11:50,547 --> 01:11:52,250
TALIESIN: And where's the green dragon.

1117
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:59,539
MARISHA: Oh, that's a good idea. Where the fuck is
Raishan? Okay.

1118
01:11:59,539 --> 01:12:01,945
LAURA: She might be with us right now.

1119
01:12:01,945 --> 01:12:06,870
MARISHA: She might be. Okay. Now I do this.

1120
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:09,075
MATT: Okay.

1121
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:15,442
MARISHA: First and foremost, what is the
geological makeup of this land around me? This

1122
01:12:15,442 --> 01:12:17,072
ravine. Cliffside.

1123
01:12:17,072 --> 01:12:18,398
MATT: What is the geological makeup?

1124
01:12:18,398 --> 01:12:19,870
MARISHA: What is it made out of, yeah.

1125
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:21,049
MATT: Stone.

1126
01:12:21,049 --> 01:12:22,586
MARISHA: And all of this stuff on the edges?

1127
01:12:22,586 --> 01:12:27,344
MATT: All of this is stone with about a foot layer
of ice on the outside of it. Portions of it that

1128
01:12:27,344 --> 01:12:31,130
have been broken or struck, you can see some
exposure to it. This ravine is not normally

1129
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:37,138
covered in snow and ice; Vorugal's presence has
brought a persistent blizzard and icy atmosphere

1130
01:12:37,138 --> 01:12:42,128
to it. So all the ice and snow you see here is
technically not natural to the terrain, and most

1131
01:12:42,128 --> 01:12:47,527
of this ravine has a very strong foundation of
solid stone, natural rock, and other various

1132
01:12:47,527 --> 01:12:49,608
geological layers beneath.

1133
01:12:49,608 --> 01:12:54,492
MARISHA: So it is fairly sturdy and not apparently
going to collapse at any moment?

1134
01:12:54,492 --> 01:12:58,396
MATT: Correct. It appears like what happened with
you and Pike earlier was an anomaly that only happens

1135
01:12:58,396 --> 01:13:02,570
when you roll two natural ones.

1136
01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:07,650
MARISHA: Sure. Okay. Can I get a sense on what the
weather is going to be like for the next 24 hours?

1137
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:14,021
MATT: Reaching out to the vicinity and picking up
what you can, it's hard to get specifics, but it

1138
01:13:14,021 --> 01:13:21,151
looks to be at least a coming sleet storm. Not
hail; nothing too heavy, but it looks like it's

1139
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:26,602
going to have some times of limited visibility,
and very cold.

1140
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:34,961
MARISHA: Bummer. Okay. Good to know. And do I
sense Raishan?

1141
01:13:34,961 --> 01:13:45,631
MATT: Within three miles? You get the essence of
the surrounding terrain that there is another

1142
01:13:45,631 --> 01:13:54,024
large dragon presence nearby, though you don't get
a specific location.

1143
01:13:54,024 --> 01:13:56,711
MARISHA: Bummer.

1144
01:13:56,711 --> 01:13:58,844
TALIESIN: It was a good thought.

1145
01:13:58,844 --> 01:14:01,016
SAM: No, that's good to know.

1146
01:14:01,016 --> 01:14:02,685
MARISHA: She's within three miles.

1147
01:14:02,685 --> 01:14:04,877
LAURA: She's here, or it's Thordak.

1148
01:14:04,877 --> 01:14:08,184
MARISHA: Well, no, he's said another, aside from
Thordak.

1149
01:14:08,184 --> 01:14:09,992
LIAM: Aside from Vorugal.

1150
01:14:09,992 --> 01:14:14,684
MATT: No, you asked for Raishan. Raishan was
confirmed to be within the vicinity.

1151
01:14:14,684 --> 01:14:18,396
MARISHA: Okay. That's it. Those are my three
questions.

1152
01:14:18,396 --> 01:14:25,480
MATT: As that question fades, you do get a little
better bit of location of Raishan's current

1153
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:35,747
presence. Raishan is currently on the very south
end of the ravine, on the outskirts of the

1154
01:14:35,747 --> 01:14:43,020
three-mile radius of near where you are right now.
Close to where you guys first came to the ruins of

1155
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:50,077
Draconia, where you were first discovered by the
Ravenites. That's all you know about her. Just

1156
01:14:50,077 --> 01:14:51,343
that location.

1157
01:14:51,343 --> 01:14:53,059
MARISHA: Close to the ruins of Draconia?

1158
01:14:53,059 --> 01:14:55,161
MATT: Where you guys first arrived when you first
came here.

1159
01:14:55,161 --> 01:14:57,118
LIAM: Not near us right now.

1160
01:14:57,118 --> 01:15:01,682
MARISHA: And not where the library and the ruins
of Draconia were.

1161
01:15:01,682 --> 01:15:03,716
MATT: Yeah. South of all that.

1162
01:15:03,716 --> 01:15:16,692
TALIESIN: All right. I like the idea of someone
going back to get Kima. I think one tunnel on this

1163
01:15:16,692 --> 01:15:22,459
side, one tunnel on the other side, and one tunnel
on the top of the ravine on either side, if you

1164
01:15:22,459 --> 01:15:23,700
can do that.

1165
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:28,308
MARISHA: And do we want them to connect so we can
get through? Little half loops, semi-circles?

1166
01:15:28,308 --> 01:15:32,540
SAM: Does this make noise? Will it vibrate the
ground?

1167
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:36,896
MARISHA: I'm pushing out earth. Yeah.

1168
01:15:36,896 --> 01:15:38,687
TALIESIN: Not a ton of noise.

1169
01:15:38,687 --> 01:15:40,296
MARISHA: Vex and I mentioned that.

1170
01:15:40,296 --> 01:15:41,868
TALIESIN: How loud will this be, do you think?

1171
01:15:41,868 --> 01:15:43,040
MARISHA: How loud will this be?

1172
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:46,391
MATT: As loud as moving large pieces of stone and
earth would.

1173
01:15:46,391 --> 01:15:48,136
TRAVIS: Loud.

1174
01:15:48,136 --> 01:15:52,701
MATT: Not stealthy work.

1175
01:15:52,701 --> 01:15:56,001
SAM: We saw a storm coming. Has it hit yet?

1176
01:15:56,001 --> 01:15:59,342
MATT: No, you've got a few more hours.

1177
01:15:59,342 --> 01:16:02,699
SAM: We can wait until the storm comes. It'll be
super windy and loud.

1178
01:16:02,699 --> 01:16:06,543
TRAVIS: Not nearly enough to move tunnels of earth
and rock.

1179
01:16:06,543 --> 01:16:09,295
SAM: Can you do something to ice? Melt it? That's
silent.

1180
01:16:09,295 --> 01:16:11,781
MARISHA: Yeah, but it's only a foot of ice.

1181
01:16:11,781 --> 01:16:14,945
SAM: Yeah, but we could carve out ice tunnels.

1182
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:21,263
LIAM: No, the ice is only a foot thick, coating
what is normally a temperate region.

1183
01:16:21,263 --> 01:16:23,450
TRAVIS: We got the house. We got the mansion.
That's it.

1184
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:24,963
LIAM: But it's one spot.

1185
01:16:24,963 --> 01:16:27,424
SAM: We can hide behind rocks.

1186
01:16:27,424 --> 01:16:29,674
MARISHA: We could do a test.

1187
01:16:29,674 --> 01:16:36,053
SAM: Can you make new rocks that are hollow?
I guess it'll still make noise.

1188
01:16:36,053 --> 01:16:45,172
MARISHA: I could make walls of stone. I can make
little-- But also keep in mind, anything that

1189
01:16:45,172 --> 01:16:52,653
I do, he'll notice. And the whole point to this is
to not make our presence known at all.

1190
01:16:52,653 --> 01:16:57,918
LAURA: And ice dragons burrow. I remember that
much.

1191
01:16:57,918 --> 01:17:02,704
MARISHA: So we could pop in our tunnels and they
could be like, "what's up?"

1192
01:17:02,704 --> 01:17:08,116
SAM: How important are these tunnels? Because if
we want, while you're doing this I can go distract

1193
01:17:08,116 --> 01:17:09,477
the dragon?

1194
01:17:09,477 --> 01:17:10,859
MARISHA: On the other end of the ravine?

1195
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:12,506
SAM: Sure, why not?

1196
01:17:12,506 --> 01:17:14,020
TALIESIN and LIAM: No.

1197
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:15,520
TRAVIS: Why would you do that?

1198
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,460
SAM: To distract the dragon so you can dig.

1199
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:22,517
LIAM: Because we can use your mansion, and when
the time is right, we can all scatter in different

1200
01:17:22,517 --> 01:17:29,134
directions quickly. Many of us can fly. I would
rather have these cubby-holes, as well, but it's

1201
01:17:29,134 --> 01:17:33,372
too risky, and it's too risky to let you go
running your little ass off around and get that

1202
01:17:33,372 --> 01:17:37,527
dragon to eat you in one bite. You're overruled.

1203
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:39,173
TRAVIS: How do we go get Kima?

1204
01:17:39,173 --> 01:17:42,024
LAURA: Somebody that can turn invisible has to go
get her.

1205
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:45,068
MARISHA: Well, you're still mist-form. That lasts
for eight hours. You can mist back.

1206
01:17:45,068 --> 01:17:48,545
LAURA: Yeah, but she can't turn into mist, so you
can go get her and turn her into mist.

1207
01:17:48,545 --> 01:17:53,896
SAM: We have the stones. What about the stones?
Stones. Someone can mist back with the stone, then

1208
01:17:53,896 --> 01:17:57,749
mist back to us and give her the stone.

1209
01:17:57,749 --> 01:17:58,600
LIAM: Yeah.

1210
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,166
TALIESIN: That'll work.

1211
01:18:00,166 --> 01:18:01,756
ASHLEY: I'll do it!

1212
01:18:01,756 --> 01:18:03,369
SAM: Ooh!

1213
01:18:03,369 --> 01:18:06,291
TRAVIS: Wait! Does the stone make any sound or
light?

1214
01:18:06,291 --> 01:18:07,637
TALIESIN: No, just goes poof.

1215
01:18:07,637 --> 01:18:09,502
TRAVIS: Really? Then sure.

1216
01:18:09,502 --> 01:18:11,959
TALIESIN: Little bit of a poof.

1217
01:18:11,959 --> 01:18:16,077
LAURA: It's a little bit of light, but we can hide
behind something when she does it. She can poof

1218
01:18:16,077 --> 01:18:18,461
from within the mansion before you make the
mansion.

1219
01:18:18,461 --> 01:18:20,116
TRAVIS: She can poof from within the mansion.

1220
01:18:20,116 --> 01:18:22,742
TALIESIN: You can't poof within the mansion.

1221
01:18:22,742 --> 01:18:25,543
MATT: You can't poof within the mansion. It
has to be on the same plane of existence.

1222
01:18:25,543 --> 01:18:27,312
LAURA: But it's daylight, so it should be fine.

1223
01:18:27,312 --> 01:18:29,456
MARISHA: The mansion's considered a pocket plane.

1224
01:18:29,456 --> 01:18:37,479
SAM: If Pike is going back as mist-- no offense,
Pike-- can you find the mansion?

1225
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:40,573
LAURA: Why don't you go with her?

1226
01:18:40,573 --> 01:18:43,640
SAM: Okay. Gladly.

1227
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:46,964
ASHLEY: Oh, okay. You'll know your mansion
better.

1228
01:18:46,964 --> 01:18:53,248
TRAVIS: Send the two bitties. And we're going to
hide out. I'm still in my mist form.

1229
01:18:53,248 --> 01:18:56,291
SAM: Did you guys de-mist-ify?

1230
01:18:56,291 --> 01:18:59,594
LAURA: Well, we've been talking, so I'm going to
say yes.

1231
01:18:59,594 --> 01:19:04,238
SAM: Hey, clever elves, can you scout around, make
sure we're not being watched?

1232
01:19:04,238 --> 01:19:09,251
LIAM: There are no elves here. My mother was a
human. Do you want to go right now?

1233
01:19:09,251 --> 01:19:11,437
LAURA: I've been keeping an eye out, but yes, I
will keep watch.

1234
01:19:11,437 --> 01:19:13,430
SAM: We're not being watched? You sure those hawks
are hawks?

1235
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:15,292
LAURA: Is anything watching us?

1236
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:16,919
MATT: Make a perception check.

1237
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:24,949
LAURA: 28.

1238
01:19:24,949 --> 01:19:32,534
MATT: 28? Looking about, there are a number of
birds in the distance. There's some that have flown

1239
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:37,225
overhead since you've been here. Nothing that
seems to be acting erratically or out of the

1240
01:19:37,225 --> 01:19:41,102
ordinary. There's a couple that have come in a
little close to watch, and then went off their own

1241
01:19:41,102 --> 01:19:43,457
way, curious as to what's going down in the ravine.

1242
01:19:43,457 --> 01:19:46,156
LIAM: Those are some birds.

1243
01:19:46,156 --> 01:19:52,984
LAURA: I think we should all be mist, though,
while we wait for them to get back. Just in case.

1244
01:19:52,984 --> 01:19:59,913
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend some time in this
form just studying to see if there's anything odd

1245
01:19:59,913 --> 01:20:01,947
about this circle at all. Studying the stones.

1246
01:20:01,947 --> 01:20:03,274
MATT: Okay.

1247
01:20:03,274 --> 01:20:08,687
TRAVIS: Where is the circle? Oh. Thank you.

1248
01:20:08,687 --> 01:20:16,865
MATT: Right, so Pike and Scanlan, you guys go mist
form, make your way over back towards where the mansion

1249
01:20:16,865 --> 01:20:23,074
was placed. Takes you a while. Are you going
through the ravine, or are you going over the ravine?

1250
01:20:23,074 --> 01:20:25,351
ASHELY: Over.

1251
01:20:25,351 --> 01:20:32,245
MATT: Okay. So the two of you guys coast up to the
side and over the top of the wall. There is some

1252
01:20:32,245 --> 01:20:40,300
heavy dead forest area here, but you coast on the
side of it, keeping an eye down. Both of you guys

1253
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:43,117
make a perception check.

1254
01:20:43,117 --> 01:20:49,950
SAM: Terrible. 11.

1255
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:52,336
LIAM: Ashley's got this.

1256
01:20:52,336 --> 01:20:53,793
ASHLEY: 21.

1257
01:20:53,793 --> 01:20:55,360
SAM: Ooh, my girl!

1258
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:59,753
MATT: As you guys are pulling around and the weather has 
gotten a little better for the moment; the storm

1259
01:20:59,753 --> 01:21:05,943
hasn't hit yet. Pike, you glance off and you can
see some stirring down in the bottom of the

1260
01:21:05,959 --> 01:21:15,715
ravine. You see two white wings (wingbeats) and you
watch as Vorugal takes off like a bat out of hell

1261
01:21:15,762 --> 01:21:22,126
up out of the ravine, past both of you, and you
can feel the wind shake and the actual ravine

1262
01:21:22,126 --> 01:21:29,357
quakes slightly at the presence as Vorugal shoots
up into the air, spirals up, then wings go out and

1263
01:21:29,357 --> 01:21:33,306
then coasts off westward, away from you guys.

1264
01:21:33,306 --> 01:21:36,619
MARISHA: Oh, away from us?

1265
01:21:36,619 --> 01:21:38,422
MATT: Away from you guys in a western direction.

1266
01:21:38,422 --> 01:21:39,848
ASHLEY: Away from them, too?

1267
01:21:39,848 --> 01:21:41,147
LIAM: Away from us.

1268
01:21:41,147 --> 01:21:42,455
MARISHA: He's going west.

1269
01:21:42,455 --> 01:21:43,804
LIAM: We're east.

1270
01:21:43,804 --> 01:21:44,976
ASHLEY: So you guys are fine.

1271
01:21:44,976 --> 01:21:46,358
TALIESIN: Wait.

1272
01:21:46,358 --> 01:21:47,847
ASHLEY: I try to make wide eyes.

1273
01:21:47,847 --> 01:21:49,260
MARISHA: (gasps) Does this mean we can dig?

1274
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:52,792
LAURA: Did we see him go in the air from where we
are?

1275
01:21:52,792 --> 01:21:55,656
MATT: Make a perception check, actually, Vex.

1276
01:21:55,656 --> 01:21:57,445
ASHLEY: We should take his loot.

1277
01:21:57,445 --> 01:22:00,416
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah. That ends well.

1278
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:02,609
LAURA: 20.

1279
01:22:02,609 --> 01:22:08,797
MATT: You do hear what sounds like heavy wings
echoing through the ravine towards your direction.

1280
01:22:08,797 --> 01:22:14,778
You see a faint movement in the sky, and then it
vanishes and you hear the sound getting more and

1281
01:22:14,778 --> 01:22:19,688
more distant. You gather Vorugal has at least left
the lair. You're not sure how long.

1282
01:22:19,688 --> 01:22:26,009
LAURA: I come out of mist form. Vorugal's not here
right now. If you're going to dig, do it. I'll

1283
01:22:26,009 --> 01:22:27,422
keep an eye on the sky.

1284
01:22:27,422 --> 01:22:29,787
MARISHA: What do you guys think, should I do it?
Over the earpiece.

1285
01:22:29,787 --> 01:22:31,033
TRAVIS: No.

1286
01:22:31,033 --> 01:22:32,091
TALIESIN: I think we should.

1287
01:22:32,091 --> 01:22:33,110
TRAVIS: No.

1288
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:35,460
TALIESIN: I think two crow's nests for the
shooters.

1289
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:37,761
LAURA: Do it quickly, if you're going to do
something.

1290
01:22:37,761 --> 01:22:39,850
TALIESIN: I draw out, really quickly in the
snow--

1291
01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:45,624
LAURA: I draw out an intricate map. Blueprints.

1292
01:22:45,624 --> 01:22:51,039
MATT: Meanwhile, Scanlan and Pike, you guys make
your way back to the mansion? Coasting over, you

1293
01:22:51,039 --> 01:23:00,253
find your way. You make your way into the mansion.
The servants are rushing two platters out of the kitchen

1294
01:23:00,253 --> 01:23:05,749
down to the stairs that lead to the subterranean
portion of the mansion.

1295
01:23:05,749 --> 01:23:07,880
SAM: Okay. Kima, sorry to interrupt lunch--

1296
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:14,872
MATT: You come downstairs and her armor is
off, her maul's at the side. She is on the ground

1297
01:23:14,872 --> 01:23:19,291
in the process of doing one-handed push-ups and
scarfing chicken with the other hand. She's

1298
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:21,395
getting ready for a fight today.

1299
01:23:21,395 --> 01:23:22,774
SAM: Disgusting.

1300
01:23:22,774 --> 01:23:24,662
ASHLEY: That's amazing!

1301
01:23:24,662 --> 01:23:29,981
MATT: She stands up. "Damn right, it is.
Stringy."

1302
01:23:29,981 --> 01:23:38,728
ASHLEY: We came back for you because he's going
to build a mansion somewhere else.

1303
01:23:38,728 --> 01:23:41,540
SAM: We need to move.

1304
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:45,197
MATT: "Okay." She takes one of the pieces of
chicken and pockets it.

1305
01:23:45,197 --> 01:23:47,442
SAM: That will disappear when we leave here.

1306
01:23:47,442 --> 01:23:54,780
MATT: (groans) Pulls it out. Sucks it off the bone
and throws it to the ground. It clatters off to

1307
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:59,023
the side. "All right, let me grab my stuff." And
she goes and gets her armor and starts putting it

1308
01:23:59,023 --> 01:24:00,727
on. "Do you want to help me?"

1309
01:24:00,727 --> 01:24:03,762
ASHLEY: To hold some stuff?

1310
01:24:03,762 --> 01:24:08,334
MATT: "Put the armor on! You know to put on plate.
Come on." You help get her armor on.

1311
01:24:08,334 --> 01:24:09,683
SAM: Do you need me to help, as well?

1312
01:24:09,683 --> 01:24:14,918
MATT: "No!" You help her get all armored up. She gets the
rest of her stuff. She came relatively light,

1313
01:24:14,918 --> 01:24:18,641
other than the materials she needs for combat.
She's ready to go in the next 15 minutes or so.

1314
01:24:18,641 --> 01:24:22,183
"All right. So. Where's this going down?"

1315
01:24:22,183 --> 01:24:29,813
SAM: I produce one half of the stones that we brought, and
I say-- oh wait, does she know how to do this? I

1316
01:24:29,813 --> 01:24:34,501
guess you just think, right? You just think. You
have to think. I know that's hard, but you're

1317
01:24:34,501 --> 01:24:43,126
going to have to hold this rock and want it to be
reunited with its pair. I'm sorry about that. And

1318
01:24:43,126 --> 01:24:50,009
then you'll be bamfed back to where we're going,
all right? Here, take this stone. All right, so

1319
01:24:50,009 --> 01:24:54,954
we'll just step out of the mansion. I won't drop
it yet, because there's no need.

1320
01:24:54,954 --> 01:24:56,318
MATT: All right.

1321
01:24:56,318 --> 01:25:04,036
SAM: And we're going to mist back, but after she's
bamfed. All right. So think happy thoughts, click

1322
01:25:04,036 --> 01:25:05,432
your heels together.

1323
01:25:05,432 --> 01:25:10,661
MATT: Steps out in the snow, crunching sound of
her boots, closes her eyes for a second, opens one

1324
01:25:10,661 --> 01:25:18,577
back at you, Scanlan. Focuses and concentrates.
The minute progresses. She clutches it and touches

1325
01:25:18,577 --> 01:25:22,976
the actual stone to the outside of her holy
symbol. You see the small platinum outline of

1326
01:25:22,976 --> 01:25:28,764
Bahamut's head. As it hits, it begins to glow. The
blue glow is also surrounded by the bright white

1327
01:25:28,764 --> 01:25:35,602
glow of Bahamut's light, and as her outer form
begins to shimmer, it blinks out with a spiral of

1328
01:25:35,602 --> 01:25:39,849
a glittery white light dust, and her form has
vanished.

1329
01:25:39,849 --> 01:25:41,698
ASHLEY: She's the coolest.

1330
01:25:41,698 --> 01:25:43,020
SAM: She's okay.

1331
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:47,045
ASHLEY: She was doing one-handed push-ups and
eating chicken in the other.

1332
01:25:47,045 --> 01:25:48,811
SAM: Can you do a one-handed push-up?

1333
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:50,333
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1334
01:25:50,333 --> 01:25:51,653
SAM: Can I see?

1335
01:25:51,653 --> 01:25:52,716
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1336
01:25:52,716 --> 01:25:57,363
(laughter)

1337
01:25:57,363 --> 01:26:03,933
MATT: And with those gauntlets, she does easily,
fully armored and all. She's leaving this little

1338
01:26:03,933 --> 01:26:06,394
Pike shape in the snow right there.

1339
01:26:06,394 --> 01:26:09,374
SAM: Can I try a one-handed push-up?

1340
01:26:09,374 --> 01:26:12,168
MATT: Make a strength check.

1341
01:26:12,168 --> 01:26:14,591
SAM: Seven.

1342
01:26:14,591 --> 01:26:16,878
(laughter)

1343
01:26:16,878 --> 01:26:21,010
MATT: (grunts) Two-handed push-up.

1344
01:26:21,010 --> 01:26:23,274
TRAVIS: On his knees.

1345
01:26:23,274 --> 01:26:26,878
SAM: I'm carrying a lot of stuff. Without my gear,
I could probably do it.

1346
01:26:26,878 --> 01:26:29,400
ASHLEY: I understand. You're also carrying a
mansion or something.

1347
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,585
SAM: Yeah. Magic weighs on you.

1348
01:26:31,585 --> 01:26:33,089
ASHLEY: Magic weighs a lot.

1349
01:26:33,089 --> 01:26:35,988
SAM: All right, let's go.

1350
01:26:35,988 --> 01:26:41,283
MATT: All right. You guys mist back, begin
cresting over to return.

1351
01:26:41,283 --> 01:26:46,283
SAM: Scanning the skies for any sight of a
flapping white dragon.

1352
01:26:46,283 --> 01:26:48,540
MATT: Okay. While that's happening, what are you
guys doing?

1353
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:50,392
TALIESIN: I'm making ice plates.

1354
01:26:50,392 --> 01:26:55,430
LAURA: I'm keeping an eye out for Vorugal or
anything suspicious.

1355
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:57,295
MARISHA: I guess I'm making tunnels.

1356
01:26:57,295 --> 01:26:59,027
MATT: Using Move Earth?

1357
01:26:59,027 --> 01:27:00,373
MARISHA: Yeah.

1358
01:27:00,373 --> 01:27:18,225
MATT: Let me see here. Move Earth is you can
reshape any dirt, sand, or clay in the area. Not stone.

1359
01:27:18,225 --> 01:27:19,744
TALIESIN: Not stone?

1360
01:27:19,744 --> 01:27:26,216
MATT: Cannot manipulate natural stone or stone
constructions.

1361
01:27:26,216 --> 01:27:28,378
TRAVIS: Or a budget rental center.

1362
01:27:28,378 --> 01:27:31,110
(laughing)

1363
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:32,850
LAURA: So you can make walls.

1364
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:34,973
TALIESIN: Can you manipulate ice?

1365
01:27:34,973 --> 01:27:37,510
SAM: She can manipulate ice.

1366
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:39,105
TALIESIN: Can you manipulate ice?

1367
01:27:39,105 --> 01:27:41,402
MARISHA: I can melt ice.

1368
01:27:41,402 --> 01:27:43,181
TALIESIN: But you can't create ice.

1369
01:27:43,181 --> 01:27:46,633
LAURA: Even if she did, it has to be something not
noticeable.

1370
01:27:46,633 --> 01:27:48,716
TALIESIN: I think that we could--

1371
01:27:48,716 --> 01:27:51,654
MARISHA: I can make some more plant life.

1372
01:27:51,654 --> 01:27:53,872
MATT: Do you have Stone Shape prepared?

1373
01:27:53,872 --> 01:27:55,171
TALIESIN: Stone Shape?

1374
01:27:55,171 --> 01:27:58,257
MARISHA: No.

1375
01:27:58,257 --> 01:28:00,773
MATT: Yeah, Stone Shape would've been the spell to
use in this circumstance.

1376
01:28:00,773 --> 01:28:02,165
MARISHA: Cool.

1377
01:28:02,165 --> 01:28:07,997
TALIESIN: If we pull some of the ice, I can try
and make sheets of ice--

1378
01:28:07,997 --> 01:28:12,529
MARISHA: But how long does Stone Shape last? I
thought it was just for a little bit.

1379
01:28:12,529 --> 01:28:14,882
MATT: Stone Shape is instantaneous. It just
affects something.

1380
01:28:14,882 --> 01:28:20,884
MARISHA: I know, but how much? It's only like a
five foot cube, right? So I can't make a tunnel.

1381
01:28:20,884 --> 01:28:22,943
MATT: Not a heavy tunnel, no.

1382
01:28:22,943 --> 01:28:24,473
MARISHA: Right, so no.

1383
01:28:24,473 --> 01:28:29,914
TALIESIN: We can alter the topography just a bit
by taking out some of the ice and then opening it

1384
01:28:29,914 --> 01:28:31,403
up to make hiding places.

1385
01:28:31,403 --> 01:28:35,678
MARISHA: I can make a little trench, like a trench
wall-line for you guys at the top of the ravine,

1386
01:28:35,678 --> 01:28:36,979
for the shooters.

1387
01:28:36,979 --> 01:28:38,616
LIAM: Yeah, half-bubbles almost.

1388
01:28:38,616 --> 01:28:40,149
MARISHA: Yes, exactly.

1389
01:28:40,149 --> 01:28:43,278
TRAVIS: 80 to 100 feet up, right.

1390
01:28:43,278 --> 01:28:45,488
TALIESIN: That'll do.

1391
01:28:45,488 --> 01:28:47,417
LAURA: Yeah, I can shoot from that height.

1392
01:28:47,417 --> 01:28:50,159
MARISHA: Right along the ledge.

1393
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:56,114
LAURA: Actually, after you do it, I can try to
disguise it, so it's not seeable from the air.

1394
01:28:56,114 --> 01:29:00,317
MATT: Okay, so what are you doing? You're making a
small ledge?

1395
01:29:00,317 --> 01:29:08,166
MARISHA: So yeah, I'm going to do Wall of Stone.
Fuck.

1396
01:29:08,166 --> 01:29:11,307
TALIESIN: We don't need a ton of space, because
we're never going to move more than six.

1397
01:29:11,307 --> 01:29:23,628
MARISHA: Yeah, I basically want a little almost
half wall for cover here and here, just extending

1398
01:29:23,628 --> 01:29:25,586
the stonework.

1399
01:29:25,586 --> 01:29:27,239
MATT: Just out this way?

1400
01:29:27,239 --> 01:29:28,667
MARISHA: Upwards.

1401
01:29:28,667 --> 01:29:30,625
So that they can--

1402
01:29:30,625 --> 01:29:32,515
MATT: Oh, okay, I see.

1403
01:29:32,515 --> 01:29:34,072
TALIESIN: Give us cover.

1404
01:29:34,072 --> 01:29:38,016
MARISHA: Do the Gears of War.

1405
01:29:38,016 --> 01:29:45,080
TRAVIS: Can I raise a point, Taliesin? Do you have
anything to keep you from falling if he attacks

1406
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:46,422
you on that ravine?

1407
01:29:46,422 --> 01:29:51,230
TALIESIN: It would be hard to fall if he attacks
us. The best thing, actually, if he attacks us up

1408
01:29:51,230 --> 01:29:52,857
there would be to jump.

1409
01:29:52,857 --> 01:29:55,435
MATT: So you're using it twice? Then over here,
you said?

1410
01:29:55,435 --> 01:30:00,741
MARISHA: You know what, let me flank it. Let me do
one on that side and one over here. Yeah? You think?

1411
01:30:00,741 --> 01:30:03,506
SAM: Why a hundred feet up?

1412
01:30:03,506 --> 01:30:05,520
TRAVIS: That's how tall the ravine is.

1413
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:07,330
SAM: Can we just do 20 feet up?

1414
01:30:07,330 --> 01:30:09,488
TALIESIN: You have a broom. I have a rope.

1415
01:30:09,488 --> 01:30:11,252
MARISHA: Is this excessive?

1416
01:30:11,252 --> 01:30:15,057
SAM: Yeah! Why a hundred feet? Why not 20 feet?
Why not 30 feet?

1417
01:30:15,057 --> 01:30:19,403
LAURA: We can't do it in the middle of the stone.
We have to do it at the top.

1418
01:30:19,403 --> 01:30:20,475
SAM: Why?

1419
01:30:20,475 --> 01:30:22,822
MATT: You could, technically.

1420
01:30:22,822 --> 01:30:27,004
MARISHA: I guess I could, actually, because I can
do a flat one. Okay. All right. You know what, I

1421
01:30:27,004 --> 01:30:29,877
could make little pod bubbles for you guys on the
half edge of the cliffs.

1422
01:30:29,877 --> 01:30:31,728
TALIESIN: Make some pod bubbles.

1423
01:30:31,728 --> 01:30:33,069
MARISHA: I'll do that.

1424
01:30:33,069 --> 01:30:34,726
TRAVIS: Aren't those going to be obvious?

1425
01:30:34,726 --> 01:30:38,405
TALIESIN: I'm going to start pouring water on this
stuff, and it's going to be ice again so quickly.

1426
01:30:38,405 --> 01:30:40,989
MARISHA: Yeah, if we try and camouflage it. Spend
the rest of the day camouflaging it.

1427
01:30:40,989 --> 01:30:44,319
TALIESIN: I've already started working on
camouflage--

1428
01:30:44,319 --> 01:30:46,806
MARISHA: The DM keeps looking at us like we're
crazy.

1429
01:30:46,806 --> 01:30:48,842
MATT: I'm trying to figure this out, guys.

1430
01:30:48,842 --> 01:30:53,459
MARISHA: All right. Here's what I'm going to do.
I'm going to make (stammers) little balconies.

1431
01:30:53,459 --> 01:30:59,608
LIAM: Spit some lyrics, girl.

1432
01:30:59,608 --> 01:31:05,875
MARISHA: (giggles) So smooth. Yeah, little balcony
ledges that they can go on.

1433
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:08,428
MATT: Okay. We'll say...

1434
01:31:08,428 --> 01:31:13,271
LAURA: He's like, "I spent a really long time
carving this shit, you guys, and you're going to

1435
01:31:13,271 --> 01:31:14,487
"be altering it."

1436
01:31:14,487 --> 01:31:15,727
MATT: It's all good.

1437
01:31:15,727 --> 01:31:19,532
LIAM: Is there any point to having you sharpshoot
from behind that wall down below?

1438
01:31:19,532 --> 01:31:21,338
MATT: So right there is what you're saying? A
little shelf.

1439
01:31:21,338 --> 01:31:27,419
MARISHA: Yeah, little ledge. Yeah, a balcony. I
want to make a cliff balcony.

1440
01:31:27,419 --> 01:31:29,793
MATT: How far up?

1441
01:31:29,793 --> 01:31:32,645
TALIESIN: I would take it to the far edge. Even
further.

1442
01:31:32,645 --> 01:31:35,509
LIAM: If we're fighting, I'm not bound by shit,
man. I can be anywhere.

1443
01:31:35,509 --> 01:31:38,612
MATT: Where do you want this to go, Marisha? Right
there?

1444
01:31:38,612 --> 01:31:40,134
MARISHA: One there, and one-- yeah.

1445
01:31:40,134 --> 01:31:41,806
MATT: Okay, so those are the two.

1446
01:31:41,806 --> 01:31:44,832
MARISHA: And about what, 40 feet up? 50 feet up?

1447
01:31:44,832 --> 01:31:46,384
TALIESIN: I'd say about 50 feet up.

1448
01:31:46,384 --> 01:31:50,143
MARISHA: How about halfway up the mountain? I want
to make it look rough, I want to try and

1449
01:31:50,143 --> 01:31:54,909
camouflage it, and then I'm also going to help
Percy and the rest of this excavation to use my

1450
01:31:54,909 --> 01:32:01,286
Gust and little Create Water spells over top of it
to start covering them with ice.

1451
01:32:01,286 --> 01:32:02,406
MATT: Okay.

1452
01:32:02,406 --> 01:32:06,574
TALIESIN: I'm creating a breakable ice shield for
when it's time, but I'm just giving the nice cover.

1453
01:32:06,574 --> 01:32:09,952
MARISHA: Yeah, cover it with ice to make it look
like the rest.

1454
01:32:09,952 --> 01:32:16,431
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and just roll a wisdom check.
Roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier.

1455
01:32:16,431 --> 01:32:20,220
MARISHA: He normally only asks me that when we're
making a terrible plan.

1456
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:26,933
TALIESIN: I know. Ooh! Check out the big brain!

1457
01:32:26,933 --> 01:32:30,092
MARISHA: Check out the big brains on Brad! 23.

1458
01:32:30,092 --> 01:32:39,614
MATT: Okay. As an Air Ashari, you have a very firm
understanding of airflow, temperature of air, and

1459
01:32:39,614 --> 01:32:45,054
how best it can quickly freeze water. Over time,
utilizing the spells at your disposal, over the

1460
01:32:45,054 --> 01:32:51,303
next 30 minutes or so, you do manage to coat the
visible recently created stone with a layer of ice

1461
01:32:51,303 --> 01:32:55,945
that in some regard would help, hopefully,
camouflage it.

1462
01:32:55,945 --> 01:32:57,654
MARISHA: Oh, he let us do it!

1463
01:32:57,654 --> 01:33:04,348
TALIESIN: I'm just going to spend all my time also
trying to keep hiding it, keep reinforcing it.

1464
01:33:04,348 --> 01:33:09,535
Once the mansion's available, I'm going to take
water and slowly add layers.

1465
01:33:09,535 --> 01:33:14,111
MATT: Okay. Scanlan and Pike, you guys do manage
to return, as you watch the party preparing these

1466
01:33:14,111 --> 01:33:21,140
small little ledges outside of the ravine
interior.

1467
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:25,791
SAM: Hey, guys. Did you see the dragon leave?

1468
01:33:25,791 --> 01:33:29,059
LAURA: I saw him fly away, yeah.

1469
01:33:29,059 --> 01:33:30,846
SAM: Should we be concerned at all?

1470
01:33:30,846 --> 01:33:34,377
LAURA: That what? He's going to get help?

1471
01:33:34,377 --> 01:33:35,973
LIAM: Well, maybe.

1472
01:33:35,973 --> 01:33:39,945
SAM: That he's going to meet up with Raishan? And
fuck us?

1473
01:33:39,945 --> 01:33:42,473
MARISHA: He was heading west, right?

1474
01:33:42,473 --> 01:33:44,982
TALIESIN: Which is not the direction where Raishan
is.

1475
01:33:44,982 --> 01:33:47,372
MARISHA: Raishan was south. She was far south.

1476
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:50,025
TRAVIS: Can you do your detect dragons thing?

1477
01:33:50,025 --> 01:33:51,661
LAURA: I guess. Yeah, I can.

1478
01:33:51,661 --> 01:33:55,942
MATT: Kima, at this point, by the way, has been
off to the side, keeping watch, goes,

1479
01:33:55,942 --> 01:33:57,578
"You guys expecting anyone?"

1480
01:33:57,578 --> 01:33:59,212
SAM and TALIESIN: Oh shit.

1481
01:33:59,212 --> 01:34:08,837
MATT: You see Kima drops the maul to the ground
and points down. And you see, stepping up from the

1482
01:34:08,837 --> 01:34:17,745
ravine from this side, this way, you see a small,
stout-looking dwarf character walking up

1483
01:34:17,745 --> 01:34:26,636
(footfalls). Bulbous red nose. You can see a thick
winter coat over, cloth tied over the top of the

1484
01:34:26,636 --> 01:34:37,456
head, a crossbow to one side. Walks up and goes,
"Hey. Larkin, the one you hired. The mercenary to

1485
01:34:37,456 --> 01:34:39,296
"help you with this exchange."

1486
01:34:39,296 --> 01:34:41,063
SAM: We hired somebody?

1487
01:34:41,063 --> 01:34:42,389
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Yes.

1488
01:34:42,389 --> 01:34:43,677
SAM: When was this?

1489
01:34:43,677 --> 01:34:47,734
LAURA: Back in Whitestone. We hired somebody to
come help us fight.

1490
01:34:47,734 --> 01:34:52,836
SAM: We did? Why on earth would we do that? We're
super strong.

1491
01:34:52,836 --> 01:34:56,135
MARISHA: I kick Scanlan a little bit.

1492
01:34:56,135 --> 01:34:57,800
SAM: Oh shit. Sorry.

1493
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:08,716
MATT: "So. Glad we've all gotten together. I see
you've begun your plans, so tell me. What is your plan?"

1494
01:35:08,716 --> 01:35:12,208
MARISHA: Larkin, was it?

1495
01:35:12,208 --> 01:35:13,966
MATT: "Larkin, aye."

1496
01:35:13,966 --> 01:35:17,716
LAURA: Larkin, do you have any spells you can
use?

1497
01:35:17,716 --> 01:35:21,895
MATT: "I've got a few tricks up my sleeve, aye.
Let's see how it pans out."

1498
01:35:21,895 --> 01:35:29,040
ASHLEY: I'm going to talk to him in Dwarvish, and
I'm going to ask where he's from.

1499
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:40,542
MATT: Okay, you ask him where he's from? "I don't
feel comfortable speaking our language in front of

1500
01:35:40,542 --> 01:35:46,754
"people who don't understand it. It's impolite."

1501
01:35:46,754 --> 01:35:48,826
MARISHA: She's good.

1502
01:35:48,826 --> 01:35:51,283
LAURA: It is quite impolite.

1503
01:35:51,283 --> 01:35:55,644
MATT: Watch as Larkin's expression gets very dire
for a second like, "what are you doing?"

1504
01:35:55,644 --> 01:36:00,900
LAURA: I whisper to Pike.

1505
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:06,595
TRAVIS: Larkin, are you ready to help us kill a
dragon?

1506
01:36:06,595 --> 01:36:09,322
MATT: "That's what you hired me for, isn't it?"

1507
01:36:09,322 --> 01:36:12,629
TRAVIS: Aye. Don't you think dragons are just the
biggest dick-fucks ever?

1508
01:36:12,629 --> 01:36:14,996
MATT: "To be honest, yes."

1509
01:36:14,996 --> 01:36:16,200
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1510
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:20,589
SAM: Oh! Oh, Larkin!

1511
01:36:20,589 --> 01:36:22,692
LAURA: Just fucking got it?

1512
01:36:22,692 --> 01:36:25,574
SAM: Oh, yes! I totally remember you, Larkin!

1513
01:36:25,574 --> 01:36:28,263
MARISHA: I kick Scanlan again, for sheer joy this
time.

1514
01:36:28,263 --> 01:36:37,926
TALIESIN: We're setting up camp. The attack begins
tomorrow morning. There's going to be a beast.

1515
01:36:37,926 --> 01:36:39,684
There will be a fight.

1516
01:36:39,684 --> 01:36:43,654
LIAM: Yeah. We kind of have a plan, but fucking
dragons.

1517
01:36:43,654 --> 01:36:47,392
TALIESIN: We'll see how it goes. We're going to
try and tire him out.

1518
01:36:47,392 --> 01:36:49,728
MATT: "All right. I'll keep an eye."

1519
01:36:49,728 --> 01:36:51,769
TALIESIN: Once he's tired out--

1520
01:36:51,769 --> 01:36:54,065
MATT: "So I'll go on your signal, then?"

1521
01:36:54,065 --> 01:36:59,730
SAM: Will you be joining us here at the battle or
providing support from afar?

1522
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:03,089
MATT: "I'll be providing support from a
comfortable space."

1523
01:37:03,089 --> 01:37:06,248
SAM: What kind of support? Long-distance attacks
or healing?

1524
01:37:06,248 --> 01:37:07,737
LIAM: What's your style?

1525
01:37:07,737 --> 01:37:15,284
MATT: "Oh. Let's just say, in the beginning I'll
go ahead and bring some pain from a distance and

1526
01:37:15,284 --> 01:37:19,704
"only close that distance when things get real
nasty and hot."

1527
01:37:19,704 --> 01:37:29,797
SAM: And Larkin, the reason we hired you, now that
I remember, was for your extreme knowledge of

1528
01:37:29,797 --> 01:37:41,372
dragons and their behaviors. Tell me this: should
we be concerned when this one leaves his lair

1529
01:37:41,372 --> 01:37:46,715
about hobbling its lair or somehow preventing it
from returning?

1530
01:37:46,715 --> 01:37:50,328
MATT: "Do you know when it's returning?"

1531
01:37:50,328 --> 01:37:52,796
TRAVIS: No.

1532
01:37:52,796 --> 01:37:55,973
SAM: Well, we know that it'll be coming here for a
fight.

1533
01:37:55,973 --> 01:37:59,256
MATT: "If you don't know when it's returning,
don't step into its lair."

1534
01:37:59,256 --> 01:38:02,230
SAM: Is there a way to prevent it from getting
back to its lair?

1535
01:38:02,230 --> 01:38:03,744
MATT: "Killing it."

1536
01:38:03,744 --> 01:38:06,231
TRAVIS: Real simple answer, I think.

1537
01:38:06,231 --> 01:38:08,601
TALIESIN: It's not like a vampire.

1538
01:38:08,601 --> 01:38:13,571
MATT: Kima leans into you Scanlan, "Who's this?"

1539
01:38:13,571 --> 01:38:15,356
SAM: Mercenary.

1540
01:38:15,356 --> 01:38:16,510
MARISHA: Larkin.

1541
01:38:16,510 --> 01:38:19,052
LAURA: We hired him.

1542
01:38:19,052 --> 01:38:20,958
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's a real dead-eye.

1543
01:38:20,958 --> 01:38:23,168
TALIESIN: There's also going to be a field of--

1544
01:38:23,168 --> 01:38:25,467
SAM: Ravenites.

1545
01:38:25,467 --> 01:38:27,875
LAURA: Potentially.

1546
01:38:27,875 --> 01:38:32,687
LIAM: Yeah. Told you it was complicated, yeah?

1547
01:38:32,687 --> 01:38:39,497
MATT: Kima crosses her arms for a second. "You
also told me you had another ally coming."

1548
01:38:39,497 --> 01:38:44,843
SAM and TALIESIN: We did?

1549
01:38:44,843 --> 01:38:46,796
TALIESIN: I wasn't there.

1550
01:38:46,796 --> 01:38:48,336
SAM: Who?

1551
01:38:48,336 --> 01:38:51,929
TRAVIS: We have a hard time keeping track of
everyone that we hire and fire.

1552
01:38:51,993 --> 01:38:53,776
TALIESIN: That's why it's going to be a great
plan.

1553
01:38:53,776 --> 01:38:57,095
SAM: You know why? We have Pike! That's our other
ally. She's here now.

1554
01:38:57,095 --> 01:38:59,225
ASHLEY: Here I am.

1555
01:38:59,225 --> 01:39:02,329
MATT: "I'm so confused right now."

1556
01:39:02,329 --> 01:39:06,309
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's all right. Listen, all you've
got to do is smash dragon with us tomorrow, yeah?

1557
01:39:06,309 --> 01:39:07,632
MATT: "Which dragon?"

1558
01:39:07,632 --> 01:39:08,957
TRAVIS: The white one.

1559
01:39:08,957 --> 01:39:11,131
LAURA: The white one that's here. That will be
here.

1560
01:39:11,131 --> 01:39:13,215
LIAM: The only one that's here.

1561
01:39:13,215 --> 01:39:19,573
TALIESIN: Let's make the mansion right now. Please
make the mansion.

1562
01:39:19,573 --> 01:39:26,866
SAM: I'll make the mansion behind a rock
outcropping. Kima, I need your help to make sure

1563
01:39:26,866 --> 01:39:29,421
I'm not spotted while I do this ritual.

1564
01:39:29,421 --> 01:39:30,827
MATT: "All right."

1565
01:39:30,827 --> 01:39:35,516
LAURA: So this is great. Tomorrow, you pop in, you
summon, we all pop back into the mansion. We're

1566
01:39:35,516 --> 01:39:38,232
hiding in the mansion while the fight's going on.

1567
01:39:38,232 --> 01:39:42,615
SAM: Well, someone has to be on the outside
watching to find out what's happening.

1568
01:39:42,615 --> 01:39:43,561
LAURA: Right.

1569
01:39:43,561 --> 01:39:47,519
MARISHA: Should we have someone near where the
dragon is, so we can get eyes?

1570
01:39:47,519 --> 01:39:52,972
SAM: Someone who can be invisible, someone who can
be a hawk or Ravenite?

1571
01:39:52,972 --> 01:39:55,524
LIAM: Scanlan, what are you going to do? You going
to pop this thing out and then

1572
01:39:55,524 --> 01:39:56,863
hop in the mansion?

1573
01:39:56,863 --> 01:39:59,958
SAM: Tomorrow, we're talking about? Yes,
absolutely!

1574
01:39:59,958 --> 01:40:03,361
LAURA: So Keyleth could be a hawk over by
Vorugal--

1575
01:40:03,361 --> 01:40:04,638
MARISHA: Watching?

1576
01:40:04,638 --> 01:40:06,733
LAURA: Is there any way to let us know, though?

1577
01:40:06,733 --> 01:40:08,059
TALIESIN: Not if we're in the mansion.

1578
01:40:08,059 --> 01:40:10,848
MARISHA: Yeah, because the earrings don't work
through the mansion, right?

1579
01:40:10,848 --> 01:40:13,566
MATT: From the inside to out, no. They have to be
in the same plane.

1580
01:40:13,566 --> 01:40:18,094
SAM: Well, someone would have to be next to the
doorway, pop their head in and say, oi, it's on.

1581
01:40:18,094 --> 01:40:22,826
But we also have these bubbles of watching around,
don't we?

1582
01:40:22,826 --> 01:40:25,100
TALIESIN: Which would be you and I before the
fight.

1583
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:27,916
SAM: Or I can just drop the mansion.

1584
01:40:27,916 --> 01:40:33,740
MARISHA: Well, the mansion could be good if things
go terribly wrong.

1585
01:40:33,740 --> 01:40:40,431
LIAM: That's true. If the mansion door is open and
hidden behind that outcropping of rock there, you

1586
01:40:40,431 --> 01:40:46,921
leave the door open but behind it, Keyleth could
take to the sky, I could find somewhere low and be

1587
01:40:46,921 --> 01:40:51,373
hidden. I can dart inside. I can be inside in a
second.

1588
01:40:51,373 --> 01:40:58,330
SAM: And at the very least, Kima can be waiting
inside the mansion, as can our lesser stealthy

1589
01:40:58,330 --> 01:41:03,799
friend Pike. At least keep them in there.

1590
01:41:03,799 --> 01:41:06,655
LAURA: Yeah. Sounds great.

1591
01:41:06,655 --> 01:41:08,328
SAM: All right.

1592
01:41:08,328 --> 01:41:09,768
TALIESIN: It's a plan.

1593
01:41:09,768 --> 01:41:11,009
SAM: It's something.

1594
01:41:11,009 --> 01:41:15,589
TALIESIN: It's a plan! Anything more complicated
would immediately fall apart when anything shifts,

1595
01:41:15,589 --> 01:41:17,405
which will inevitably happen.

1596
01:41:17,405 --> 01:41:26,628
LAURA: Actually, can I do Primeval Awareness and
search for dragons to see if Vorugal's even in the

1597
01:41:26,628 --> 01:41:28,105
area at all?

1598
01:41:28,105 --> 01:41:32,806
MATT: Sure. As you concentrate, you get a very
strong nearby presence.

1599
01:41:32,806 --> 01:41:37,464
MARISHA: She came in the mansion with us?

1600
01:41:37,464 --> 01:41:38,746
TALIESIN: No.

1601
01:41:38,746 --> 01:41:41,099
SAM: There is no mansion yet. I haven't done it
yet.

1602
01:41:41,099 --> 01:41:43,016
MARISHA: Oh, you haven't done it yet. Never mind.

1603
01:41:43,016 --> 01:41:48,723
MATT: And you sense a closing dragon presence. At
which point, you hear in the distance

1604
01:41:48,723 --> 01:41:51,203
(wingbeats).

1605
01:41:51,203 --> 01:41:52,222
TALIESIN: Mansion.

1606
01:41:52,222 --> 01:41:53,462
LAURA: Mansion. Right now.

1607
01:41:53,462 --> 01:41:55,776
SAM: All right, I will cast the mansion behind a
rock.

1608
01:41:55,776 --> 01:41:57,590
LAURA: And run into it.

1609
01:41:57,590 --> 01:41:59,839
TALIESIN: We will see you in the morning.

1610
01:41:59,839 --> 01:42:01,855
MATT: To?

1611
01:42:01,855 --> 01:42:03,115
TRAVIS: Larkin.

1612
01:42:03,115 --> 01:42:06,659
MATT: To Larkin? All right. He goes, "Right."

1613
01:42:06,659 --> 01:42:09,662
TALIESIN: Thank you. Truly.

1614
01:42:09,662 --> 01:42:11,833
LAURA: Seriously, get in the mansion! Right now.

1615
01:42:11,833 --> 01:42:16,211
MATT: You glance off the side, and you can see
Larkin looking off into the distance, and the

1616
01:42:16,211 --> 01:42:24,470
white dragon Vorugal is curling in the air,
currently wrestling with something, and then

1617
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:27,279
shoots down back into the ravine to the lair.

1618
01:42:27,279 --> 01:42:35,769
MARISHA: Can I get like a glimpse of it before I
run in on what it is? 27.

1619
01:42:35,769 --> 01:42:37,115
MATT: 27?

1620
01:42:37,115 --> 01:42:38,279
SAM: It's Yenk.

1621
01:42:38,279 --> 01:42:40,052
(laughter)

1622
01:42:40,052 --> 01:42:41,192
MARISHA: Damn it!

1623
01:42:41,192 --> 01:42:45,369
MATT: What brief view you have, it appears to be,
by its size comparison, small-looking, but

1624
01:42:45,369 --> 01:42:51,967
glancing at it, it looks to be some sort of a dire
bear or dire wolf. Some sort of large furred

1625
01:42:51,967 --> 01:42:54,272
entity that is currently being torn apart
mid-air.

1626
01:42:54,272 --> 01:42:55,943
MARISHA: So it went hunting.

1627
01:42:55,943 --> 01:42:58,442
MATT: Apparently. May have been hungry.

1628
01:42:58,442 --> 01:43:00,056
LIAM: Snack.

1629
01:43:00,056 --> 01:43:05,471
MATT: You guys make your way into the mansion for
a bit of a respite. Kima carries out the end of

1630
01:43:05,471 --> 01:43:13,071
it, steps inside. "I don't trust that dwarf."

1631
01:43:13,071 --> 01:43:19,699
TALIESIN: Excellent. That's why you're here.
That's why he's not in here.

1632
01:43:19,699 --> 01:43:22,379
LAURA: He can't know that you know.

1633
01:43:22,379 --> 01:43:25,629
MATT: "Good to know."

1634
01:43:25,629 --> 01:43:29,584
SAM: Kima, if it would help, I can erase your
memory of this whole thing--

1635
01:43:29,584 --> 01:43:36,923
MATT: "You finish that sentence, and I will
destroy you where you stand, Scanlan Shorthalt."

1636
01:43:36,923 --> 01:43:42,592
SAM: I'll let it alone for now.

1637
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:45,073
MARISHA: Good idea.

1638
01:43:45,073 --> 01:43:47,249
MATT: "Come near me--"

1639
01:43:47,249 --> 01:44:02,145
TALIESIN: We wake up early. Before the sun rises,
those of us who have to hide, hide. Once we see

1640
01:44:02,145 --> 01:44:06,863
them bringing him to the summoning circle, we call
the beast and we wait. We are going to be in the

1641
01:44:06,863 --> 01:44:09,675
most danger, because we're going to be right in
the thick of it.

1642
01:44:09,675 --> 01:44:12,019
LAURA: What if he sees you, Percy? I'm better at
hiding myself.

1643
01:44:12,019 --> 01:44:14,646
TALIESIN: We're both going to be hiding in an
ice-covered cubby-hole.

1644
01:44:14,646 --> 01:44:17,930
LAURA: A lot of white.

1645
01:44:17,930 --> 01:44:26,224
TALIESIN: It's not possible to get to those
cubby-holes without a difficult climb, is it?

1646
01:44:26,224 --> 01:44:28,963
LAURA: I could always bring you up on the broom.

1647
01:44:28,963 --> 01:44:32,648
MATT: If you get dropped off by broom, it's easy.
Where is the mansion door, again?

1648
01:44:32,648 --> 01:44:37,114
SAM: Behind the bigger rock where Percy's
stationed right now.

1649
01:44:37,114 --> 01:44:39,870
LIAM: Yeah, we should wake up before sunlight.

1650
01:44:39,870 --> 01:44:49,663
MATT: Guess we'll say, as you guys all vanish from
there, the entrance is right there, to the

1651
01:44:49,663 --> 01:44:50,681
mansion.

1652
01:44:50,681 --> 01:44:53,755
MARISHA: Who's going to keep an eye on Larkin?

1653
01:44:53,755 --> 01:44:56,467
TALIESIN: I think it's hilarious that we can think
we can.

1654
01:44:56,467 --> 01:44:58,178
SAM: Larkin can take care of--

1655
01:44:58,178 --> 01:45:04,729
LIAM: Also, we've no fucking idea where Raishan is or
what she's going to do, if anything.

1656
01:45:04,729 --> 01:45:07,424
TALIESIN: We know that the one place she isn't is
in here.

1657
01:45:07,424 --> 01:45:13,274
LAURA: Larkin is Raishan. Really?

1658
01:45:13,274 --> 01:45:15,372
TRAVIS: Holy shit. <i>I</i> even got that.

1659
01:45:15,372 --> 01:45:16,709
(laughter)

1660
01:45:16,709 --> 01:45:18,940
LAURA: You're the last one to realize that?

1661
01:45:18,940 --> 01:45:23,240
TRAVIS: You're the last person in this room and on
the internet.

1662
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:24,288
LAURA: No!

1663
01:45:24,288 --> 01:45:27,181
LIAM: It's me. I'm the last one. I had no idea.

1664
01:45:27,181 --> 01:45:29,019
SAM: Hey, it took me five minutes.

1665
01:45:29,019 --> 01:45:32,360
TALIESIN: Wow! Oh my god, we're going to die.

1666
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:34,063
MARISHA: I knew the second she walked up!

1667
01:45:34,063 --> 01:45:38,638
SAM: Ashley figured it out before us.

1668
01:45:38,638 --> 01:45:41,160
ASHLEY: No, she told me.

1669
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:46,553
MATT: As you guys rest to prepare for your next
day's excursion, we're going to take a restroom

1670
01:45:46,553 --> 01:45:47,774
break here.

1671
01:45:47,774 --> 01:45:51,292
LIAM: It's half of us, Laura! Jeez!

1672
01:45:51,292 --> 01:45:54,247
MATT: We'll see you guys back here in a few
minutes.

1673
01:45:54,247 --> 02:02:09,690
[break]

1674
02:02:09,690 --> 02:02:16,228
MATT: Welcome back. So! After that brief break,
you guys have taken your time in the evening to

1675
02:02:16,228 --> 02:02:21,693
rest up and get your spells back. Prepared for the
coming confrontation, your now one-day delayed

1676
02:02:21,693 --> 02:02:27,959
confrontation with Vorugal. As your evening comes
to a close, the next morning is now before you--

1677
02:02:27,959 --> 02:02:31,271
MARISHA: Hang on, we weren't done. We weren't
done. We have to do things.

1678
02:02:31,271 --> 02:02:33,037
LAURA: Yeah. One last thing.

1679
02:02:33,037 --> 02:02:36,927
MARISHA: We have to eat. We have to do the Heroes'
Feast, for sure.

1680
02:02:36,927 --> 02:02:38,498
SAM: Who's going to do it?

1681
02:02:38,498 --> 02:02:40,175
ASHLEY: I am.

1682
02:02:40,175 --> 02:02:44,518
MATT: All right. Pike drops down a Heroes' Feast.
1,000 gold out of your queue.

1683
02:02:44,518 --> 02:02:46,948
LAURA: That's okay!

1684
02:02:46,948 --> 02:02:48,745
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Worth it, man.

1685
02:02:48,745 --> 02:02:53,223
MATT: All of you enjoy your first non-chicken
related meal within Scanlan's mansion.

1686
02:02:53,223 --> 02:02:54,875
LAURA: Feels good.

1687
02:02:54,875 --> 02:03:03,044
MATT: First in a while, at least. So as part of
the Heroes' Feast, guys, if you recall the details

1688
02:03:03,044 --> 02:03:04,669
of that circumstance.

1689
02:03:04,669 --> 02:03:07,526
SAM: Immune to fear.

1690
02:03:07,526 --> 02:03:09,591
MATT: Immune to fear, definitely.

1691
02:03:09,591 --> 02:03:11,488
MARISHA: Saves on wisdom throws.

1692
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:13,301
MATT: Wisdom saving throws have advantage.

1693
02:03:13,301 --> 02:03:15,631
MARISHA: Also plus 2d10.

1694
02:03:15,631 --> 02:03:17,604
MATT: 2d10 to your maximum hit points.

1695
02:03:17,604 --> 02:03:22,496
MARISHA: And I think that's it.

1696
02:03:22,496 --> 02:03:25,798
MATT: And you're immune to diseases. Immune to
poison.

1697
02:03:25,798 --> 02:03:28,201
LAURA: (gasps) You're immune to poison on this?!

1698
02:03:28,201 --> 02:03:30,577
MARISHA: That's right. Fuck you Raishan.

1699
02:03:30,577 --> 02:03:36,299
SAM: Advantage on wisdom saves. Immune to poison.

1700
02:03:36,299 --> 02:03:42,673
MATT: All right, so marking hit points. Let me
know what your maximum hit point totals increases

1701
02:03:42,673 --> 02:03:43,808
are, currently.

1702
02:03:43,808 --> 02:03:46,452
SAM: Increased 14 points.

1703
02:03:46,452 --> 02:03:48,393
MATT: 14 points to Scanlan's maximum hit points.

1704
02:03:48,393 --> 02:03:49,626
TALIESIN: 17.

1705
02:03:49,626 --> 02:03:51,179
MATT: 17 to Percy.

1706
02:03:51,179 --> 02:03:54,377
MARISHA: An additional 11 to Keyleth.

1707
02:03:54,377 --> 02:03:55,757
MATT: 11 to Keyleth.

1708
02:03:55,757 --> 02:03:56,806
LIAM: 15.

1709
02:03:56,806 --> 02:03:58,215
MATT: 15 to Vax.

1710
02:03:58,215 --> 02:04:01,641
LAURA: I got two tens! I got an additional 20!

1711
02:04:01,641 --> 02:04:03,319
MARISHA: You got two tens?!

1712
02:04:03,319 --> 02:04:04,792
MATT: Pike?

1713
02:04:04,792 --> 02:04:07,791
ASHLEY: I got nine, so that brings me to 97.

1714
02:04:07,791 --> 02:04:08,798
MATT: Awesome.

1715
02:04:08,798 --> 02:04:10,094
TRAVIS: I got 11.

1716
02:04:10,094 --> 02:04:17,995
MATT: 11 to Grog, and then to Kima: eight. Write
that down right there.

1717
02:04:17,995 --> 02:04:28,722
MARISHA: And are we sure we don't want eyes on
her? I'm not concerned about her well-being,

1718
02:04:28,722 --> 02:04:34,849
clearly. I'm concerned on whatever her name she's
saying she is right now.

1719
02:04:34,849 --> 02:04:40,862
TALIESIN: My theory on that subject is that she's
clever enough that eyes on her would not be

1720
02:04:40,862 --> 02:04:45,820
helpful in the first place. It's best to assume
that even if we could see her that she would be

1721
02:04:45,820 --> 02:04:47,824
tricking us over what she's doing.

1722
02:04:47,824 --> 02:04:53,655
SAM: Okay and if she starts killing us, what do we
do? Hide in the mansion? Regroup?

1723
02:04:53,655 --> 02:04:58,892
TALIESIN: Hide in the mansion and worst-case
scenario, scream that she betrayed us and that she

1724
02:04:58,892 --> 02:05:02,719
promised that she would help kill the white dragon
and see if they'll fight it out.

1725
02:05:02,719 --> 02:05:07,240
LIAM: Worst-case scenario, we'll pull back towards
the mansion if she starts whaling on us.

1726
02:05:07,240 --> 02:05:10,055
TALIESIN: Yes. And definitely inspire some
conflict.

1727
02:05:10,055 --> 02:05:14,706
LAURA and MARISHA: Okay.

1728
02:05:14,706 --> 02:05:17,295
SAM: Let's go fight.

1729
02:05:17,295 --> 02:05:19,245
LAURA: Now we sleep.

1730
02:05:19,245 --> 02:05:20,497
SAM: Oh, sleep.

1731
02:05:20,497 --> 02:05:26,782
MATT: Your evening meal complete, you all find
yourself back to full rest, preparing yourselves

1732
02:05:26,782 --> 02:05:28,995
for tomorrow's grand showdown.

1733
02:05:28,995 --> 02:05:30,620
TALIESIN: I'm at negative one.

1734
02:05:30,620 --> 02:05:33,702
MATT: You're now negative one to all of your
rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

1735
02:05:33,702 --> 02:05:34,882
TALIESIN: Not to damage, though.

1736
02:05:34,882 --> 02:05:36,995
MATT: No. Just your d20 rolls.

1737
02:05:36,995 --> 02:05:38,725
LIAM: You can get all 19s.

1738
02:05:38,725 --> 02:05:47,088
LAURA: As I am going to sleep, I want to inscribe
"sinaeth" on Fenthras.

1739
02:05:47,088 --> 02:05:48,565
MATT: Okay.

1740
02:05:48,565 --> 02:05:50,156
SAM: What?

1741
02:05:50,156 --> 02:05:59,625
MATT: You don't know. Evening's rest complete,
spells chosen for those who need to choose spells.

1742
02:05:59,625 --> 02:06:08,495
Prepare yourselves for this confrontation. The
morning comes. That early tension of imminent

1743
02:06:08,495 --> 02:06:21,054
chaos fills the air. Conversation is short. What
preparations do you wish to make this morning?

1744
02:06:21,054 --> 02:06:30,467
TALIESIN: Vex is going to put me in that pocket.

1745
02:06:30,467 --> 02:06:37,895
LAURA: Yes. I can't cast Pass Without a Trace on
him from that far away.

1746
02:06:37,895 --> 02:06:40,417
TALIESIN: We have Dust of Tracelessness.

1747
02:06:40,417 --> 02:06:46,447
LAURA: Yes, but that's only tracks. While we're
over there, before I go over to my side, I'm going

1748
02:06:46,447 --> 02:06:52,390
to try to cover his area with Natural Explorer and
try to hide him.

1749
02:06:52,390 --> 02:06:57,175
TALIESIN: We're going to fly over there, as well.
And then also we're attaching a rope, just in case.

1750
02:06:57,175 --> 02:06:59,759
MATT: Attaching a rope to?

1751
02:06:59,759 --> 02:07:06,488
TALIESIN: To the wall, so I have something to
climb down with if I need to. It's not going to be

1752
02:07:06,488 --> 02:07:08,267
hanging out; it's all in.

1753
02:07:08,267 --> 02:07:12,721
MATT: Okay, the stone is like a smooth wall that
comes out and then upward for the protective point.

1754
02:07:12,721 --> 02:07:17,452
LAURA: I have climbing gear. You can use it as a
grappling hook, maybe. Does that work at all?

1755
02:07:17,452 --> 02:07:23,094
MATT: You can fashion something. Make an
intelligence check.

1756
02:07:23,094 --> 02:07:28,426
LAURA: Ten.

1757
02:07:28,426 --> 02:07:29,954
TALIESIN: Six.

1758
02:07:29,954 --> 02:07:37,364
MATT: It seems like it'll hold? You have a metal
piece wedged into a part of the stone that seems

1759
02:07:37,364 --> 02:07:39,356
pretty taut with the rope attached.

1760
02:07:39,356 --> 02:07:46,784
MARISHA: Can I ask a logistical question? How wide
and alive are those trees?

1761
02:07:46,784 --> 02:07:56,107
MATT: They are maybe a foot wide each, and
currently, it looks like a lot of them are dying

1762
02:07:56,107 --> 02:08:00,968
or dead from the perpetual snowfall and coverage
that they are unused to.

1763
02:08:00,968 --> 02:08:07,536
MARISHA: So Tree Stride probably wouldn't work on
these guys. I'm wondering if I should waste my time.

1764
02:08:07,536 --> 02:08:19,732
MATT: Tree Stride. Same size as you. Some of them,
maybe.

1765
02:08:19,732 --> 02:08:21,554
MARISHA: All right.

1766
02:08:21,554 --> 02:08:26,015
SAM: Am I making us all Ravenites, or does that
not even matter anymore?

1767
02:08:26,015 --> 02:08:28,086
LAURA: I don't think that matters.

1768
02:08:28,086 --> 02:08:29,787
SAM: Okay.

1769
02:08:29,787 --> 02:08:33,385
LAURA: Have we left? Are me and Percy outside
already?

1770
02:08:33,385 --> 02:08:37,167
MATT: You guys have gone outside if you're going
to place him up in his perch there and help cover

1771
02:08:37,167 --> 02:08:38,738
the area.

1772
02:08:38,738 --> 02:08:42,994
LIAM: You have to do it, right? Because you're the
one releasing this thing.

1773
02:08:42,994 --> 02:08:46,136
SAM: I guess if I'm going to be out in the open, I
probably should.

1774
02:08:46,136 --> 02:08:49,682
LIAM: And if you're doing it, does it take any
more mojo to do it to all of us or just yourself?

1775
02:08:49,682 --> 02:08:51,968
It can't hurt to do it to all of us.

1776
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:52,896
SAM: Sure.

1777
02:08:52,896 --> 02:08:54,586
LAURA: Make us all white Ravenites.

1778
02:08:54,586 --> 02:08:57,090
SAM: You mean wearing white clothes?

1779
02:08:57,090 --> 02:09:07,249
LAURA: Sorry, I meant so we blend into the
ice, not so that we're white. That sounded so

1780
02:09:07,249 --> 02:09:14,103
terrible. I meant so that we're the same color as
the ice and we're camouflaged! Like chameleons.

1781
02:09:14,103 --> 02:09:18,976
TALIESIN: Are there actually enough albino
Ravenites that we would stick out, or is that a

1782
02:09:18,976 --> 02:09:20,422
common color?

1783
02:09:20,422 --> 02:09:22,200
MATT: You haven't really encountered any.

1784
02:09:22,200 --> 02:09:25,522
TALIESIN: Oh, then I would recommend not. I would
recommend white clothing.

1785
02:09:25,522 --> 02:09:31,676
MATT: You've seen varying shades of chromatic and
metallic.

1786
02:09:31,676 --> 02:09:33,094
TALIESIN: All right.

1787
02:09:33,094 --> 02:09:34,686
MARISHA: Snow camouflage.

1788
02:09:34,686 --> 02:09:35,843
TALIESIN: Snowy.

1789
02:09:35,843 --> 02:09:37,828
MATT: Okay. What are you doing?

1790
02:09:37,828 --> 02:09:43,798
SAM: I guess I'll make us all white Ravenites.
Normal Ravenites with lighter-colored clothing

1791
02:09:43,798 --> 02:09:53,168
that can maybe blend in. But also we can't dance
very well and we clap on the two and the four. So

1792
02:09:53,168 --> 02:09:55,236
yes, I'll make us all Ravenites.

1793
02:09:55,236 --> 02:09:59,298
MATT: Okay. So does that include Kima?

1794
02:09:59,298 --> 02:10:03,148
SAM: I can do eight people, so that's everyone,
including Kima.

1795
02:10:03,148 --> 02:10:08,011
MATT: All right, so you are all currently for the
purposes of this visually Ravenites of varying

1796
02:10:08,011 --> 02:10:16,481
sizes and bulkiness. Okay, is everyone currently
out and about right now? Outside of the house?

1797
02:10:16,481 --> 02:10:19,050
SAM: I'm going out.

1798
02:10:19,050 --> 02:10:20,807
LAURA: Who all is leaving?

1799
02:10:20,807 --> 02:10:24,369
SAM: Oh wait, before I leave, doesn't someone have
to buff me up for this spell?

1800
02:10:24,369 --> 02:10:30,590
MARISHA: I do. Yep, I do. I'm going to cast
Enhance Ability on your charisma.

1801
02:10:30,590 --> 02:10:32,631
LAURA: How long does that last?

1802
02:10:32,631 --> 02:10:37,309
MARISHA: An hour. So if we're ready to go?

1803
02:10:37,309 --> 02:10:39,448
SAM: Yeah, what time is it? Is it dawn?

1804
02:10:39,448 --> 02:10:44,951
MATT: You're not entirely certain. Make a survival
check.

1805
02:10:44,951 --> 02:10:49,923
LAURA: 18.

1806
02:10:49,923 --> 02:10:53,445
SAM: Eight.

1807
02:10:53,445 --> 02:11:01,641
MATT: You have no idea, Scanlan. It's about noon,
from where you gather where the sun would be

1808
02:11:01,641 --> 02:11:05,691
around that time based on what bits of shadows you
can see. However, the sleet storm is starting to

1809
02:11:05,691 --> 02:11:12,106
kick in, and you can see now the sheets of really
cold rain with a slush to them are beginning to

1810
02:11:12,106 --> 02:11:17,113
pound across the bottom of the ravine. The wind is
picking up a bit, and the temperature is dropping

1811
02:11:17,113 --> 02:11:18,457
significantly.

1812
02:11:18,457 --> 02:11:19,965
LAURA: Bundle!

1813
02:11:19,965 --> 02:11:21,071
MARISHA: Yep.

1814
02:11:21,071 --> 02:11:30,716
SAM: Okay. How will we know when it's time for me
to release? We have to wait for Tooma to go report.

1815
02:11:30,716 --> 02:11:33,458
LAURA: Is Vorugal back? He's back.

1816
02:11:33,458 --> 02:11:34,995
SAM: I assume.

1817
02:11:34,995 --> 02:11:37,348
LAURA: Do we see Larkin around?

1818
02:11:37,348 --> 02:11:40,614
MATT: No, you do not see Larkin around.

1819
02:11:40,614 --> 02:11:46,380
SAM: Vax, do you want to go look?

1820
02:11:46,380 --> 02:11:48,284
LIAM: For Larkin?

1821
02:11:48,284 --> 02:11:53,329
SAM: No, fuck Larkin. To see when Tooma's coming.
I don't want to release this thing before Tooma is

1822
02:11:53,329 --> 02:11:55,442
there reporting to Vorugal.

1823
02:11:55,442 --> 02:12:00,523
LAURA: Well, maybe if we cause enough of a ruckus
as soon as we release him.

1824
02:12:00,523 --> 02:12:05,369
LIAM: I mean if we trust Tooma to hold up her part
of the bargain, that dragon is coming here.

1825
02:12:05,369 --> 02:12:12,508
LAURA: We need to make a lot of noise and then
release it. Attract attention, release it, hide.

1826
02:12:12,508 --> 02:12:14,273
SAM: But when?

1827
02:12:14,273 --> 02:12:15,896
LAURA: Whenever we want to.

1828
02:12:15,896 --> 02:12:19,607
SAM: No, when is Vorugal coming? We can't sit out
here all day waiting.

1829
02:12:19,607 --> 02:12:22,788
LAURA: Vorugal will come when we make a noise.
He'll come over here.

1830
02:12:22,788 --> 02:12:25,643
SAM: The Ravenites have to tell him to come here
first.

1831
02:12:25,643 --> 02:12:30,524
LAURA: No, she told him that it's coming, I don't
think she's telling him a specific time.

1832
02:12:30,524 --> 02:12:33,126
SAM: No, she's telling him now. Today. We told her
to wait.

1833
02:12:33,126 --> 02:12:39,280
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
Vax and Keyleth, you guys notice down off the

1834
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:44,912
southern edge of the ravine, you see three
humanoid figures walking up to your direction,

1835
02:12:45,020 --> 02:12:47,449
coasting along the side of the mountain range.

1836
02:12:47,449 --> 02:12:49,603
MARISHA: Do they appear to be Ravenites?

1837
02:12:49,603 --> 02:12:55,323
MATT: After a short time inspecting them, they
appear to be Ravenite in structure, yeah. They are

1838
02:12:55,323 --> 02:12:59,088
dragonborn, they are heavily robed, and they are
coasting up along the side.

1839
02:12:59,088 --> 02:13:06,013
MARISHA: Vex, you want to talk to them? They might
have told him. Might have been the ones that just

1840
02:13:06,013 --> 02:13:07,006
told him.

1841
02:13:07,006 --> 02:13:08,083
LAURA: I walk over.

1842
02:13:08,083 --> 02:13:10,708
MATT: As you acknowledge them and begin to
approach, one of them breaks from the two and they

1843
02:13:10,708 --> 02:13:16,472
stay back. As it approaches you can see the tall
burly dragonborn form, this is Skork. You met when

1844
02:13:16,472 --> 02:13:26,703
you first came to the ruins of Draconia. He
approaches. "Tooma sends me. When are we to tell

1845
02:13:26,703 --> 02:13:28,787
"the dragon the hunt is on?"

1846
02:13:28,787 --> 02:13:30,190
MARISHA: We're ready whenever you are.

1847
02:13:30,190 --> 02:13:32,823
LAURA: Give us 30 minutes. And then do it.

1848
02:13:32,823 --> 02:13:41,439
MATT: "30 minutes. It will be done." He returns to
the other two, and they begin to make their way

1849
02:13:41,439 --> 02:13:44,945
rather briskly back towards the direction of
Vorugal's lair.

1850
02:13:44,945 --> 02:13:51,933
TALIESIN: When you see the dragon pop up into the
sky and head this direction, start summoning.

1851
02:13:51,933 --> 02:13:54,716
LAURA: Percy? Up?

1852
02:13:54,716 --> 02:13:56,032
TALIESIN: Yes, please.

1853
02:13:56,032 --> 02:13:58,148
LAURA: All right. I take Percy up top.

1854
02:13:58,148 --> 02:14:02,275
MATT: You bring Percy up onto the top. The rain is
starting to come down hard now and you're

1855
02:14:02,275 --> 02:14:08,932
instinctively getting chills and shivering a
little bit. You get up into your little parapet

1856
02:14:08,932 --> 02:14:10,834
area, place him there.

1857
02:14:10,834 --> 02:14:13,955
LAURA: I try to move some snow around and try to
block it.

1858
02:14:13,955 --> 02:14:16,411
MATT: Percy, I need you to make a stealth check.
Just in general.

1859
02:14:16,411 --> 02:14:18,690
SAM: Who, me?

1860
02:14:18,690 --> 02:14:22,351
MATT: No, just Percy.

1861
02:14:22,351 --> 02:14:25,119
TALIESIN: That's 16.

1862
02:14:25,119 --> 02:14:30,419
MATT: 16. Good to know. Okay. So you place him up
there. What else are you guys doing? You have 30

1863
02:14:30,419 --> 02:14:31,851
minutes, 25 now.

1864
02:14:31,851 --> 02:14:38,962
LIAM: I'm going to hide behind the stone that's in
the bottom end of the screen I'm looking at. Nope,

1865
02:14:38,962 --> 02:14:43,686
opposite side. Nope, opposite wall. Sorry. Behind
it.

1866
02:14:43,686 --> 02:14:47,515
SAM: Oops, Percy died.

1867
02:14:47,515 --> 02:14:51,003
LAURA: Don't say that again!

1868
02:14:51,003 --> 02:14:54,660
LIAM: And I think I already said it, but the
Deathwalker's Ward is set to cold.

1869
02:14:54,660 --> 02:14:56,281
MATT: Yes.

1870
02:14:56,281 --> 02:14:58,475
SAM: Does anyone want to be invisible for an
hour?

1871
02:14:58,475 --> 02:15:01,776
TRAVIS: Are we not going to be in the house?

1872
02:15:01,776 --> 02:15:06,785
SAM: Some of us will be. Do you want to wait in
the house, Grog?

1873
02:15:06,785 --> 02:15:08,271
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll be in the house.

1874
02:15:08,271 --> 02:15:09,478
SAM: And Pike, too?

1875
02:15:09,478 --> 02:15:12,898
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to stay in the house for a
little bit.

1876
02:15:12,898 --> 02:15:16,158
SAM: Okay, I'm going to cast it and probably
go into the house.

1877
02:15:16,158 --> 02:15:19,138
MATT: So Pike is staying up in the house?

1878
02:15:19,138 --> 02:15:21,419
TALIESIN: I would not object to invisibility.

1879
02:15:21,419 --> 02:15:23,274
LAURA: Yeah, can you make us invisible?

1880
02:15:23,274 --> 02:15:27,174
SAM: I can make a couple of you invisible.
Keyleth, do you want to make anybody invisible?

1881
02:15:27,174 --> 02:15:30,473
MARISHA: I can't do that. You keep forgetting
that's <i>you</i> who can do that.

1882
02:15:30,473 --> 02:15:31,972
SAM: You can't do that?

1883
02:15:31,972 --> 02:15:33,241
MARISHA: No.

1884
02:15:33,241 --> 02:15:37,090
SAM: You know what? I can't do it, anyway. I think
Gate is a concentration spell. Even if I'm reading

1885
02:15:37,090 --> 02:15:38,429
it off a scroll?

1886
02:15:38,429 --> 02:15:39,964
MARISHA: No, it takes an action to cast.

1887
02:15:39,964 --> 02:15:42,231
SAM: It is a concentration spell.

1888
02:15:42,231 --> 02:15:47,424
MATT: It is, and as part of the casting of it, it
would drop concentration.

1889
02:15:47,424 --> 02:15:49,540
SAM: Okay. Then I can't make anyone invisible.

1890
02:15:49,540 --> 02:15:54,792
LAURA: Can I fly up and see if I can see Percy
before I head over to my side?

1891
02:15:54,792 --> 02:16:02,209
MATT: You glide up into the air. Make a stealth
check.

1892
02:16:02,209 --> 02:16:09,842
LAURA: I don't want to go too high! 17.

1893
02:16:09,842 --> 02:16:17,819
MATT: Okay. You coast up. Make a perception
check.

1894
02:16:17,819 --> 02:16:21,837
LAURA: 32.

1895
02:16:21,837 --> 02:16:29,369
MATT: Against the white snow and the ice, the
parapet structure itself is slightly off-color to

1896
02:16:29,369 --> 02:16:34,022
the rest of the ice, and you do see the gleaming
of Percy's cloak through the cover you've placed.

1897
02:16:34,022 --> 02:16:38,692
LAURA: Shit. I dive back down and try to cover him
a little bit more before I head over to my side.

1898
02:16:38,692 --> 02:16:43,842
MATT: Okay, that'll be the rest of this 30-minute
preparation for you to do that. All right, who

1899
02:16:43,842 --> 02:16:45,856
else is doing what now?

1900
02:16:45,856 --> 02:16:48,059
MARISHA: I think I just peed a little.

1901
02:16:48,059 --> 02:16:50,368
MATT: Keyleth is peeing a little.

1902
02:16:50,368 --> 02:16:53,901
LAURA: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on
myself as soon as I get to the other side so I can

1903
02:16:53,901 --> 02:16:55,663
stay stealthed on my side.

1904
02:16:55,663 --> 02:16:57,642
MATT: Where are you staying, then?

1905
02:16:57,642 --> 02:17:00,189
LAURA: On the other ledge. Yeah. I'm trying to
hide myself.

1906
02:17:00,189 --> 02:17:05,042
MATT: Okay, roll a stealth check. And Trinket
is staying in your necklace?

1907
02:17:05,042 --> 02:17:10,834
LAURA: Yes! 32.

1908
02:17:10,834 --> 02:17:15,827
MATT: 32, good to know. All right. Pike, what are
you doing? You're staying inside the mansion right now?

1909
02:17:15,827 --> 02:17:17,528
ASHLEY: I'm staying inside the mansion for right
now.

1910
02:17:17,528 --> 02:17:21,203
MATT: Okay. Any other spells or casting
preparation? Consider what spells you have that

1911
02:17:21,203 --> 02:17:24,327
are not concentration that help defend. This is
the time to do it.

1912
02:17:24,327 --> 02:17:32,774
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and wait until the
15-minute mark-- no, I'm going to wait until the

1913
02:17:32,774 --> 02:17:36,287
ten-minute mark and then Enhance Ability on
Scanlan.

1914
02:17:36,287 --> 02:17:38,072
MATT: Okay, got you.

1915
02:17:38,072 --> 02:17:42,484
TRAVIS: If you pour poison on a blade, do you get
poison damage if you hit them with it?

1916
02:17:42,484 --> 02:17:48,753
MATT: If there is a blade you can apply poison to,
then yes, you would probably do a little bit of

1917
02:17:48,753 --> 02:17:50,373
poison damage.

1918
02:17:50,373 --> 02:17:57,243
LAURA: You know what, I want to pop Trinket out. I
want him to be in the mansion with Pike and Grog. Go!

1919
02:17:57,243 --> 02:18:06,974
MATT: Grog, you're in the mansion, as well? All
righty. Kima is like (anticipation noise).

1920
02:18:06,974 --> 02:18:10,302
LAURA: Hide, Kima! Oh, she doesn't have
an earring.

1921
02:18:10,302 --> 02:18:16,018
MATT: Nope. She joins you guys in the mansion for
now. And Vax, you're hiding over behind that rock?

1922
02:18:16,018 --> 02:18:19,899
Roll stealth, if you could.

1923
02:18:19,899 --> 02:18:21,462
LIAM: Natural 20.

1924
02:18:21,462 --> 02:18:27,036
MATT: Okay. You grasp onto the rock, and much
like the elven cloaks in Lord of the Rings, you

1925
02:18:27,135 --> 02:18:28,935
blend in with the stonework.

1926
02:18:28,935 --> 02:18:31,124
LIAM: I'm going to go meditate on disguised
dwarves. Goodbye.

1927
02:18:31,124 --> 02:18:41,763
MATT: Grog, any preparation you're doing for this?
All righty. As time begins to tick down, 15

1928
02:18:41,763 --> 02:18:44,696
minutes left, ten minutes left--

1929
02:18:44,696 --> 02:18:46,970
MARISHA: I cast Enhance Ability on Scanlan.

1930
02:18:46,970 --> 02:18:49,380
MATT: Okay, you're enhancing his?

1931
02:18:49,380 --> 02:18:50,703
MARISHA: Charisma.

1932
02:18:50,703 --> 02:18:52,283
MATT: All righty.

1933
02:18:52,283 --> 02:18:59,333
MARISHA: And then I am going to move. We don't
have anyone over here yet, really, correct?

1934
02:18:59,333 --> 02:19:04,593
MATT: No. You have Percy up here but no one down
there.

1935
02:19:04,593 --> 02:19:08,534
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to-- fuck.

1936
02:19:08,534 --> 02:19:09,940
MATT: Going to?

1937
02:19:09,940 --> 02:19:12,017
MARISHA: Hide behind the tree and stealth as much
as I can.

1938
02:19:12,017 --> 02:19:13,618
MATT: Okay, roll a stealth check.

1939
02:19:13,618 --> 02:19:17,384
LAURA: Keyleth, shouldn't you hide in the
mansion?

1940
02:19:17,384 --> 02:19:21,533
SAM: Can you become an animal?

1941
02:19:21,533 --> 02:19:31,156
LAURA: Shouldn't you hide right now? Just be out
of the way until Vorugal--

1942
02:19:31,156 --> 02:19:37,183
MARISHA: I can be an animal if you feel like you
want eyes out here, as well, but I won't be able

1943
02:19:37,183 --> 02:19:38,658
to go elemental.

1944
02:19:38,658 --> 02:19:39,973
TALIESIN: Then no.

1945
02:19:39,973 --> 02:19:40,991
SAM: Ever?

1946
02:19:40,991 --> 02:19:42,219
MARISHA: Until I rest.

1947
02:19:42,219 --> 02:19:44,500
LAURA: We've got eyes on. We're above. Just go
hide.

1948
02:19:44,500 --> 02:19:45,897
MARISHA: All right, I go in the mansion.

1949
02:19:45,897 --> 02:19:56,858
MATT: Okay, Keyleth makes her way back into
the mansion. All right. Five minutes. Four

1950
02:19:56,933 --> 02:20:03,045
minutes. Three minutes. Two minutes.

1951
02:20:03,045 --> 02:20:04,964
SAM: I will inspire myself.

1952
02:20:04,964 --> 02:20:07,001
MATT: Okay, that's part of your ability.

1953
02:20:07,001 --> 02:20:11,862
SAM: Yes, I will say to myself: all right,
Scanlan. I know that your palms are sweaty. Your

1954
02:20:11,862 --> 02:20:20,244
knees are weak, arms heavy. There's cologne on
your tunic, Grog's spaghetti. But just remember.

1955
02:20:20,244 --> 02:20:25,035
You're good enough. You're smart enough, and
doggone it, people like you.

1956
02:20:25,035 --> 02:20:26,660
TRAVIS: Did you merge 8 Mile with--

1957
02:20:26,660 --> 02:20:28,596
LIAM: With Stuart Smalley.

1958
02:20:28,596 --> 02:20:35,020
MATT: All right, so. As you step forward, where do
you want to open the Gate scroll?

1959
02:20:35,020 --> 02:20:42,163
SAM: I'm still going to hang out by the rocks,
and I can go at least 60 feet in front of me, but

1960
02:20:42,163 --> 02:20:43,977
I'll do 50 feet.

1961
02:20:43,977 --> 02:20:45,176
MATT: Okay.

1962
02:20:45,176 --> 02:20:47,839
SAM: In the center, basically.

1963
02:20:47,839 --> 02:20:49,775
MATT: About there?

1964
02:20:49,775 --> 02:20:50,622
SAM: Yeah, sure.

1965
02:20:50,622 --> 02:20:51,724
MATT: Okay.

1966
02:20:51,724 --> 02:20:53,958
MARISHA: Remember to be super direct with his
name.

1967
02:20:53,958 --> 02:20:55,527
SAM: And his name is Yenk?

1968
02:20:55,527 --> 02:20:58,997
MARISHA: Here, let me give you the script.

1969
02:20:58,997 --> 02:21:03,315
MATT: As you pull the scroll out, fumbling in
your fingers slightly, you're slightly sweaty and

1970
02:21:03,315 --> 02:21:04,751
nervous.

1971
02:21:04,751 --> 02:21:08,231
SAM: I'm not going to read it until I hear wings
flapping.

1972
02:21:08,231 --> 02:21:10,060
MATT: Okay.

1973
02:21:10,060 --> 02:21:12,464
SAM: It takes six seconds to do, right?

1974
02:21:12,464 --> 02:21:14,851
MATT: Make a perception check.

1975
02:21:14,851 --> 02:21:18,713
SAM: Oh boy. That's an eight.

1976
02:21:18,713 --> 02:21:22,365
MARISHA: You have advantage on charisma
checks.

1977
02:21:22,365 --> 02:21:26,511
MATT: This is not charisma. This is his
perception.

1978
02:21:26,511 --> 02:21:28,900
LAURA: Do we see him in the sky at all?

1979
02:21:28,900 --> 02:21:35,405
MATT: You make a perception check. Don't hear any
wings. You're listening; the wind's (whistles),

1980
02:21:35,405 --> 02:21:37,576
the sound of the rain hitting the ground.

1981
02:21:37,576 --> 02:21:39,110
LAURA: 19.

1982
02:21:39,110 --> 02:21:44,262
MATT: You begin to hear the flapping of wings in
the distance and you glance over.

1983
02:21:44,262 --> 02:21:48,463
LAURA: Scanlan! What are you doing? Cast it!

1984
02:21:48,463 --> 02:21:50,091
SAM: Okay, I'm casting.

1985
02:21:50,091 --> 02:21:54,479
MATT: Okay, as you pull the scroll out and begin
reading it, the sigils and arcane glyphs are

1986
02:21:54,479 --> 02:22:00,013
ancient and convoluted, and you're trying to trace
them with your eyes and you begin speaking,

1987
02:22:00,013 --> 02:22:06,624
letting the ancient knowledge that you've gained
through your existence of wandering Exandria begin

1988
02:22:06,624 --> 02:22:10,685
to pour out on its own. You feel the magic
take hold and your grip tightens as the script

1989
02:22:10,685 --> 02:22:16,791
begins to light up with a slight bluish-purple
tint. As it begins to light up around, I need you

1990
02:22:16,791 --> 02:22:21,362
to check to see if you succeed in reading to
scroll.

1991
02:22:21,362 --> 02:22:22,923
SAM: Okay. So I roll with advantage?

1992
02:22:22,923 --> 02:22:25,020
MATT: You roll with advantage. Highest of two.

1993
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:29,649
SAM: (gasps) Not great. Okay. And what am I
adding?

1994
02:22:29,649 --> 02:22:34,908
MATT: Your d12 to it. So roll a d12. And plus
two.

1995
02:22:34,908 --> 02:22:38,239
SAM: Plus two?

1996
02:22:38,239 --> 02:22:40,165
MATT: Plus two because Jack of All Trades.

1997
02:22:40,165 --> 02:22:42,333
SAM: Plus my charisma?

1998
02:22:42,333 --> 02:22:44,700
MATT: Plus your charisma bonus, which is six.

1999
02:22:44,700 --> 02:22:47,357
SAM: 20.

2000
02:22:47,357 --> 02:22:49,360
MATT: Okay, the DC was 19.

2001
02:22:49,360 --> 02:22:51,063
(yelling)

2002
02:22:51,063 --> 02:22:53,380
MARISHA: Every little bit helps.

2003
02:22:53,380 --> 02:22:55,749
TALIESIN: Oh, we made the gumbo.

2004
02:22:55,749 --> 02:23:03,646
MATT: As some of the glyphs begin to shake and
part of the scroll begins to burn at the edges,

2005
02:23:03,646 --> 02:23:08,775
you maintain concentration, staring at it. The
rain's hammering down on the scroll; it's growing

2006
02:23:08,775 --> 02:23:12,847
slick and pouring off into the center of your
sleeve. You're soaked to the bone now and

2007
02:23:12,847 --> 02:23:17,154
shivering as you're reading out these various
language bits that are flowing through. You're now

2008
02:23:17,154 --> 02:23:22,156
an instrument for the spell that is beyond your
capability, and as suddenly the spell finishes,

2009
02:23:22,156 --> 02:23:28,708
your fingers tighten and the scroll bursts into
flame and turns to dust around you. And for a

2010
02:23:28,708 --> 02:23:33,994
split second, you think you may have failed.

2011
02:23:33,994 --> 02:23:39,247
(spell noises) This giant bluish doorway erupts
across the way.

2012
02:23:39,247 --> 02:23:40,765
SAM: Facing away from me.

2013
02:23:40,765 --> 02:23:48,311
MATT: Facing away from you. You see, all of you,
that the somewhat dark and shadowed ravine is now

2014
02:23:48,311 --> 02:23:56,771
suddenly aglow with bright vibrant bluish light.
The blue light turns to crimson, to a deep burning

2015
02:23:56,771 --> 02:24:09,120
red, and you hear this horrible, deep sucking
sound. And you watch as Yenk the goristro is

2016
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:14,887
thrown from it, landing in the center of the
ravine, fist to the ground--

2017
02:24:14,887 --> 02:24:18,001
LAURA and ASHLEY: We're going to die!

2018
02:24:18,001 --> 02:24:21,008
MATT: Are you leaving the gate open?

2019
02:24:21,008 --> 02:24:25,555
SAM: No, I close it instantly.

2020
02:24:25,555 --> 02:24:31,580
MATT: Okay, the gate slams shut behind, the
reddish light then now being consumed with a final

2021
02:24:31,580 --> 02:24:33,385
blip of blue before it disappears.

2022
02:24:33,385 --> 02:24:37,663
SAM: I'm going to tiptoe backwards into the
mansion.

2023
02:24:37,663 --> 02:24:44,443
MATT: Well, the goristro swoops the head over in
your direction. I need you to make a stealth check.

2024
02:24:44,443 --> 02:24:46,096
SAM: That's a seven.

2025
02:24:46,096 --> 02:24:51,512
LIAM: Oh, Sam! (groans)

2026
02:24:51,512 --> 02:24:55,322
TRAVIS: (whispers) Roll a little better.

2027
02:24:55,322 --> 02:25:05,016
MATT: You watch as the hulking behemoth, its
extremely muscular body covered in fur and bony

2028
02:25:05,016 --> 02:25:12,965
protrusions like spikes that jut out of its form,
horrible hooked teeth and giant curled horns that

2029
02:25:12,965 --> 02:25:19,248
push forward with brass jewelry emblazoned across
the bone. Whips around, its red eyes beaming

2030
02:25:19,248 --> 02:25:28,677
straight on you. In a deep, guttural voice, it
(foreign words) and begins to just lumber in your

2031
02:25:28,677 --> 02:25:29,695
direction.

2032
02:25:29,695 --> 02:25:31,465
MARISHA: Oh god!

2033
02:25:31,465 --> 02:25:37,308
MATT: For right now, I need you, just for right
now, Scanlan, roll initiative.

2034
02:25:37,308 --> 02:25:39,376
LAURA: Oh my god.

2035
02:25:39,376 --> 02:25:41,755
SAM: 21!

2036
02:25:41,755 --> 02:25:43,897
(cheering)

2037
02:25:43,897 --> 02:25:49,167
MATT: All right, you're going before it does. What
are you doing?

2038
02:25:49,167 --> 02:25:53,099
LIAM: Bamf to the door and go in!

2039
02:25:53,099 --> 02:25:56,980
TRAVIS: Focus your chi.

2040
02:25:56,980 --> 02:25:58,571
SAM: I sing at it.

2041
02:25:58,571 --> 02:26:00,499
LAURA: Oh my god.

2042
02:26:00,499 --> 02:26:02,782
TALIESIN: No, he's got a movement and an action.

2043
02:26:02,782 --> 02:26:14,333
SAM: I sing at it. I will sing: (singing) Yenk,
you will be our friend, travel through the portal

2044
02:26:14,333 --> 02:26:23,480
and back again. Your heart is true, you're a fiend
and a confidant. Boom boom boom. (speaking) All

2045
02:26:23,480 --> 02:26:29,124
right, so I will Dominate Monster, with the hand
cone.

2046
02:26:29,124 --> 02:26:31,327
MATT: Right. All right. Puts you at a full DC of
what?

2047
02:26:31,327 --> 02:26:32,567
SAM: 21.

2048
02:26:32,567 --> 02:26:42,511
MATT: 21. That is a 13. Those who are watching,
Yenk comes barreling, and then comes to a stop and

2049
02:26:42,511 --> 02:26:48,058
stands there, looking down at this tiny gnome
about 40 feet away and nods.

2050
02:26:48,058 --> 02:26:55,804
SAM: I say, you will stay here, and you will kill
a white dragon.

2051
02:26:55,804 --> 02:27:07,249
MATT: You see steam shoot out from the nose as now
you notice the sound of the wings. (whooshing)

2052
02:27:07,249 --> 02:27:10,979
SAM: And I will tiptoe back into the mansion.

2053
02:27:10,979 --> 02:27:14,717
MARISHA: That was the coolest thing you've ever
done!

2054
02:27:14,717 --> 02:27:17,354
MATT: At which point--

2055
02:27:17,354 --> 02:27:20,149
TALIESIN: No!

2056
02:27:20,149 --> 02:27:25,075
(yelling)

2057
02:27:25,075 --> 02:27:26,477
SAM: It's huge!

2058
02:27:26,477 --> 02:27:28,115
LAURA: Oh no, he's so big!

2059
02:27:28,115 --> 02:27:30,127
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

2060
02:27:30,127 --> 02:27:32,256
LIAM: Make all the action figure sounds, Matt!

2061
02:27:32,256 --> 02:27:40,448
ASHLEY: That's a biggie.

2062
02:27:40,448 --> 02:27:55,274
MATT: At this point in time, Vorugal lands.
(snorting) And unleashes a torrent of frozen ice

2063
02:27:55,274 --> 02:27:56,575
in this direction.

2064
02:27:56,575 --> 02:27:59,741
MARISHA: I've been waiting for this all week!

2065
02:27:59,741 --> 02:28:02,121
LAURA: I hope we can take it and it actually does
damage.

2066
02:28:02,121 --> 02:28:04,221
MATT: That is going to be--

2067
02:28:04,221 --> 02:28:18,568
MARISHA: Just dies instantly. Oh fuck. Apparently
white dragons are its weakness.

2068
02:28:18,568 --> 02:28:20,106
LAURA: I know!

2069
02:28:20,106 --> 02:28:23,618
SAM: We're in a lobby, eating chicken.

2070
02:28:23,618 --> 02:28:29,380
TRAVIS: A little elevator music playing.

2071
02:28:29,380 --> 02:28:34,581
MATT: As the blast hits, you can see coats of ice
across the floor. So you guys are aware, the ice

2072
02:28:34,581 --> 02:28:38,828
and sleet and everything here is making the entire
terrain rough terrain. So everyone is at half

2073
02:28:38,828 --> 02:28:45,512
speed on foot in this entire battlefield. You can
see the actual air around Vorugal itself is

2074
02:28:45,512 --> 02:28:52,500
crystallizing into thick mist that surrounds his
form sightly. Yenk is blasted with all this frozen

2075
02:28:52,500 --> 02:28:58,195
frost-breath, and you can see the icicles
crystallizing against his form. (roars) Goes

2076
02:28:58,195 --> 02:29:06,640
running forward, and slams, goring with its horns
into Vorugal's chest.

2077
02:29:06,640 --> 02:29:11,104
LAURA: This feels like more like playtime than
anything. All the action figures: bam bam bam!

2078
02:29:11,104 --> 02:29:22,780
MATT: Watch me play with my toys, guys! All right,
you watch as the horns slam into Vorugal's chest,

2079
02:29:22,780 --> 02:29:28,815
not really expecting the ferocity and the sheer
force of this entity it's unfamiliar with. The

2080
02:29:28,815 --> 02:29:40,847
horns spark with flames, strangely. It also tears
this giant gash in two points across Vorugal's

2081
02:29:40,847 --> 02:29:52,599
chest. You can see white scales fly from the
impact. And also, okay. It is not pushed. Vorugal

2082
02:29:52,599 --> 02:30:00,202
stands its ground as Yenk pulls back. You see dark
purple blood from the edge of the horns of the

2083
02:30:00,202 --> 02:30:09,151
goristro. End of his turn. All right, does not
save against the Dominate Monster.

2084
02:30:09,151 --> 02:30:14,756
SAM: Yeah, that means he's still dominated. Okay.

2085
02:30:14,756 --> 02:30:18,111
TALIESIN: He has not realized this is possibly a
poor idea.

2086
02:30:18,111 --> 02:30:21,007
TRAVIS: Yenk's going to go, "Come on, chum. Let's
be friends."

2087
02:30:21,007 --> 02:30:24,959
MATT: It did take damage from the ice breath, so
it would have been trying to make its save. Did

2088
02:30:24,959 --> 02:30:33,326
not make it. At the end of Yenk's turn, Vorugal is
going to use two of its legendary actions to do a

2089
02:30:33,326 --> 02:30:49,004
wing attack. With a three, Yenk is knocked prone,
and he suffers 15 points of bludgeoning damage. At

2090
02:30:49,004 --> 02:30:52,648
which point, Vorugal's moving.

2091
02:30:52,648 --> 02:31:15,265
Takes up into the air, right above. Now coming to
Vorugal's turn. Vorugal gets cold breath back. And

2092
02:31:15,265 --> 02:31:18,956
while Yenk is on the ground, looking upward and
trying to get back up from the slick snow,

2093
02:31:18,956 --> 02:31:33,316
releases another blast of cold breath down onto
Yenk once more. Constitution save, plus 14. Does

2094
02:31:33,316 --> 02:31:40,243
make its save again. It's a hardy individual;
constitution saves are high. It causes this

2095
02:31:40,243 --> 02:31:48,074
cluster of ice to gather around his form, and he
breaks free. Vorugal is then also going to use its

2096
02:31:48,074 --> 02:31:52,524
flight to move over this way and spin around.

2097
02:31:52,524 --> 02:31:57,092
LIAM: Natural 20 on my stealth.

2098
02:31:57,092 --> 02:32:09,139
MATT: Yenk is going to use its turn to stand up.
It looks around. It does make its save, breaking

2099
02:32:09,139 --> 02:32:11,382
Dominate Monster, so that is gone.

2100
02:32:11,382 --> 02:32:14,603
SAM: Okay. Would I feel that? No, I'm on another
plane of existence.

2101
02:32:14,603 --> 02:32:17,393
MATT: You're on another plane of existence. You
guys are all in this quiet space, fingers crossed,

2102
02:32:17,393 --> 02:32:29,841
hoping right now. Yenk looks frustrated at this
point in time. Not a whole lot I can do right now

2103
02:32:29,841 --> 02:32:46,303
at the moment, so it's going to run beneath and
attempt to leap to grab it. Unfortunately, it

2104
02:32:46,303 --> 02:32:51,531
does not make the full height. Leaps up in the air
with all its strength; its thick muscular, hoofed

2105
02:32:51,531 --> 02:32:58,318
hind legs crouch down and leaps in the air, its
giant claws reaching forth, but Vorugal keeps just out

2106
02:32:58,318 --> 02:33:02,391
of reach and kicks out with its claws and tail,
knocking it back onto the ground.

2107
02:33:02,391 --> 02:33:04,183
It lands, no effect.

2108
02:33:04,183 --> 02:33:11,385
Vorugal's turn now. Actually, at the end of Yenk's
turn-- no, it's not close enough. Come back to

2109
02:33:11,385 --> 02:33:20,679
Vorugal's turn. Vorugal does not get the ice
breath back. It's going to swoop down, eager to

2110
02:33:20,679 --> 02:33:25,303
finish this hunt, and is going to unleash a series
of attacks.

2111
02:33:25,303 --> 02:33:35,756
Yeah, this is an interesting dynamic right now,
because it looks like Yenk is resisting a lot of

2112
02:33:35,756 --> 02:33:47,167
the cold impact from this. Vorugal's going to do a
full range of attacks. Hits with the bite, hits

2113
02:33:47,167 --> 02:33:58,459
with the claw, hits with the tail. Lands and bites
into him. You see ice shards go shooting off from

2114
02:33:58,459 --> 02:34:03,791
the impact with the teeth. Both claws tear into
the chest, but you can see the flesh itself is

2115
02:34:03,791 --> 02:34:09,121
hardy and resistant to the dragon's attacks. It's
damaging it, but Yenk is definitely made of

2116
02:34:09,121 --> 02:34:10,796
sturdier stuff.

2117
02:34:10,796 --> 02:34:12,439
LAURA: While this is going on: Percival.

2118
02:34:12,439 --> 02:34:13,368
TALIESIN: Yes?

2119
02:34:13,368 --> 02:34:17,441
LAURA: If Yenk dies really fast, what do we do?

2120
02:34:17,441 --> 02:34:22,457
TALIESIN: I'm going to signal them to come out.

2121
02:34:22,457 --> 02:34:23,838
LAURA: Oh fuck.

2122
02:34:23,838 --> 02:34:28,486
MATT: Okay, it comes to Yenk's turn now. As you
guys are having this conversation, he is going to

2123
02:34:28,486 --> 02:34:30,170
make two of its fist attacks and one with its
hoof.

2124
02:34:30,170 --> 02:34:31,849
SAM: Yes, Yenk! Yes!

2125
02:34:31,849 --> 02:34:35,899
MATT: A hit. A miss. And a hit.

2126
02:34:35,899 --> 02:34:44,916
TALIESIN: He's expending power, as well.

2127
02:34:44,916 --> 02:34:50,281
MARISHA: Yeah, he's burned two of his legendary
actions already. Yeah, we're watching the dragon

2128
02:34:50,281 --> 02:34:51,841
burn through his legendary actions.

2129
02:34:51,841 --> 02:34:53,215
TALIESIN: That's the other thing.

2130
02:34:53,215 --> 02:34:54,510
LAURA: Oh, that's great!

2131
02:34:54,510 --> 02:34:55,918
MATT: Legendary actions it gets every turn.

2132
02:34:55,918 --> 02:34:59,037
LAURA: He hasn't burned through any resistances,
though.

2133
02:34:59,037 --> 02:35:05,901
MATT: You watch as after the clawing goes through
Yenk's chest, Yenk reaches up and grabs the edge

2134
02:35:05,901 --> 02:35:14,204
of Vorugal's scaly back of its head and uppercuts
right into the jaw, and then brings up one of its

2135
02:35:14,204 --> 02:35:19,620
hooves and straight-up chest kicks with the
sharpened hoof into the center of Vorugal's chest.

2136
02:35:19,620 --> 02:35:22,946
It leaves Vorugal stumbling back for a second. At
the end of that turn, it's going to use two of its

2137
02:35:22,946 --> 02:35:29,064
legendary actions to once again beat its wings.
Yenk, not being a very dexterous individual, fails

2138
02:35:29,064 --> 02:35:38,452
and gets knocked prone once again, sending Vorugal
once again up to there. Back to Vorugal's turn, he

2139
02:35:38,452 --> 02:35:48,650
does not get the ice breath, but it looks like
Vorugal actually is moving further and further

2140
02:35:48,650 --> 02:35:51,181
away and is biding his time.

2141
02:35:51,181 --> 02:35:55,371
SAM: I'm going to cast Invisibility on myself and
poke my head out the door. Yeah, that'll work.

2142
02:35:55,371 --> 02:35:59,288
MATT: Yeah, you look out. Make a perception check.
The sleet is coming down pretty hard, so you're

2143
02:35:59,288 --> 02:36:01,362
having to glean what you can.

2144
02:36:01,362 --> 02:36:03,028
SAM: Fucking eight.

2145
02:36:03,028 --> 02:36:09,048
MATT: You can see some movement of dragon stuff in
the air, and you hear various pitches of growling,

2146
02:36:09,048 --> 02:36:11,971
horrible, angry yelling in the center of the
battlefield.

2147
02:36:11,971 --> 02:36:13,530
MARISHA: So we know they're here.

2148
02:36:13,530 --> 02:36:14,579
MATT: You know they're there.

2149
02:36:14,579 --> 02:36:16,863
SAM: Battle is still going on. I'll check again in
12 seconds.

2150
02:36:16,863 --> 02:36:23,980
MATT: Yenk's turn, very frustrated, can't seem to
figure out what to do, is going to attempt to leap

2151
02:36:23,980 --> 02:36:32,966
once more. Nope. He runs, leaps, tries to grab at
the foot. Vorugal steps out of the way. Yenk

2152
02:36:32,966 --> 02:36:45,902
finishes landing on the opposite side; no effect.
Turns around. All right. Vorugal. Gets the cold

2153
02:36:45,902 --> 02:36:56,309
breath back. He is going to fly backwards, and as
it does, sprays an unholy mess of frozen breath

2154
02:36:56,309 --> 02:37:02,343
energy down towards Yenk, who does not make the
save, but still takes resistant damage, thanks to

2155
02:37:02,343 --> 02:37:09,431
cold resistance. You watch with each impact Yenk's
open wounds are getting frost shards jammed into

2156
02:37:09,431 --> 02:37:14,925
them. Right now, it looks like Yenk doesn't have
much of a recourse until Vorugal is on the ground,

2157
02:37:14,925 --> 02:37:18,986
and Vorugal seems to have noticed this and is
starting to keep a distance, and is waiting.

2158
02:37:18,986 --> 02:37:20,727
MARISHA: I can ground him.

2159
02:37:20,727 --> 02:37:24,289
SAM: And expose yourself?

2160
02:37:24,289 --> 02:37:27,633
MARISHA: I'm just throwing it out there. I can
ground him.

2161
02:37:27,633 --> 02:37:35,880
MATT: Back to Yenk's turn. At the end of Vorugal's
turn, Vorugal is going to take up about ten more

2162
02:37:35,880 --> 02:37:43,924
feet... to get completely out of his leaping range
there.

2163
02:37:43,924 --> 02:37:45,933
LIAM: How high is he?

2164
02:37:45,933 --> 02:37:57,595
MATT: Right now? 60 feet up. Yenk leaps and can't
quite get that height and angrily begins to reach

2165
02:37:57,595 --> 02:37:59,984
over and climb up the side of the mountain there.

2166
02:37:59,984 --> 02:38:02,028
LIAM: Can I attack him right now?

2167
02:38:02,028 --> 02:38:03,332
MATT: What's up?

2168
02:38:03,332 --> 02:38:04,859
LIAM: Can I attack him right now?

2169
02:38:04,859 --> 02:38:06,354
MATT: Which one?

2170
02:38:06,354 --> 02:38:11,016
LIAM: Vorugal. 60 feet. I'm sharpshooter; he's 60
feet away from me.

2171
02:38:11,016 --> 02:38:13,789
MATT: 60 feet is your range. He's a little higher
than 60 feet from the angle.

2172
02:38:13,789 --> 02:38:15,191
SAM: Are you on the ground?

2173
02:38:15,191 --> 02:38:16,371
LAURA: He's on the ground.

2174
02:38:16,371 --> 02:38:17,715
LIAM: Pop out the wings.

2175
02:38:17,715 --> 02:38:19,434
MATT: Or the wings, you could do that.

2176
02:38:19,434 --> 02:38:28,119
LIAM: Fly within 40 feet of him. Throw Whisper at
his ass. That's what I'm doing. Assassin.

2177
02:38:28,119 --> 02:38:31,126
SAM: Are you going to go up his ass into his
stomach?

2178
02:38:31,126 --> 02:38:33,440
LAURA: In the dragon again.

2179
02:38:33,440 --> 02:38:34,861
SAM: In the dragon!

2180
02:38:34,861 --> 02:38:43,811
MATT: All right. As you step over, the wings
unleash and you fly up right underneath Vorugal

2181
02:38:43,811 --> 02:38:45,097
right there.

2182
02:38:45,097 --> 02:38:47,772
LIAM: Do I need to roll for stealth, though?

2183
02:38:47,772 --> 02:38:51,591
MATT: No, you're still stealthed. You were holding
that, yeah. You don't seem to be noticed. Right

2184
02:38:51,591 --> 02:38:57,259
now, Vorugal's attention is faced over as it's
floating, staring at Yenk, who's now starting to

2185
02:38:57,259 --> 02:39:00,388
climb up the side of the mountain.

2186
02:39:00,388 --> 02:39:04,605
LIAM: So finally, this is advantage and an
automatic critical hit? Assassin trait.

2187
02:39:04,605 --> 02:39:14,659
MATT: Well, let's see. I'd say, given the
circumstances, it is unaware that you are part of

2188
02:39:14,659 --> 02:39:20,914
the battlefield, even though there is a current
threat in its circumstance, so in this situation-- let

2189
02:39:20,914 --> 02:39:24,716
me double-check real fast.

2190
02:39:24,716 --> 02:39:27,449
SAM: It's not even a Dungeons and Dragons book.

2191
02:39:27,449 --> 02:39:29,710
TALIESIN: It's a cookbook!

2192
02:39:29,710 --> 02:39:31,489
SAM: They're all people!

2193
02:39:31,489 --> 02:39:37,270
SAM and TALIESIN: It's a cookbook!

2194
02:39:37,270 --> 02:39:41,316
MATT: I would say, given the fact that it's
completely unaware there was any other combatants

2195
02:39:41,316 --> 02:39:46,180
in the vicinity aside from Yenk, I will allow this
to be a surprise attack from you, though he

2196
02:39:46,180 --> 02:39:49,128
is not considered surprised to anybody else. There
isn't a surprise round.

2197
02:39:49,128 --> 02:39:50,861
LIAM: All right. I rolled a 28.

2198
02:39:50,861 --> 02:39:52,344
MATT: Oh, that hits.

2199
02:39:52,344 --> 02:40:01,348
LIAM: This is Whisper. I'm using Whisper. I'm
going to cast Divine Smite on the attack, as well.

2200
02:40:01,348 --> 02:40:04,686
MATT: All right. Roll damage on that.

2201
02:40:04,686 --> 02:40:06,550
ASHLEY: Kill him. One turn.

2202
02:40:06,550 --> 02:40:10,920
LIAM: Here we go. Two.

2203
02:40:10,920 --> 02:40:12,676
LAURA: (laughing) Four!

2204
02:40:12,676 --> 02:40:23,981
LIAM: Hold on. No, so all the dice first. Two plus
the psychic damage, which is 1d8. Nine. Plus the

2205
02:40:23,981 --> 02:40:48,335
Divine Smite, which is 15. Yeah, here comes the sneak
attack damage. (counting) 38, plus my modifier

2206
02:40:48,335 --> 02:41:01,059
which is 46. No, we double the dice first, so 38
times two. 76. Plus eight is 84.

2207
02:41:01,059 --> 02:41:07,580
MATT: 84 points of damage against Vorugal. Are you
going with the blade, or you letting it sit?

2208
02:41:07,580 --> 02:41:09,158
LIAM: Oh, I went with the blade.

2209
02:41:09,158 --> 02:41:10,808
LAURA: So you're on Vorugal right now?

2210
02:41:10,808 --> 02:41:15,487
MATT: So as you throw the blade up, it strikes
into one of the wounds that Yenk had already

2211
02:41:15,487 --> 02:41:21,361
clawed under its chest, and the blade sinks up to
the hilt and further in, and as you appear, you're

2212
02:41:21,361 --> 02:41:23,526
actually wrist-deep in the wound right now.

2213
02:41:23,526 --> 02:41:25,526
TRAVIS: Back in the dragon again!

2214
02:41:25,526 --> 02:41:30,289
MATT: You are right up with Vorugal right now.

2215
02:41:30,289 --> 02:41:36,728
LIAM: I'm hasted. That's action number one. Action
number two is to throw Whisper down toward the

2216
02:41:36,728 --> 02:41:50,284
trees closest to you, DM, and bamf there, and use
my bonus action to hide. I'll hit the ground, right?

2217
02:41:50,284 --> 02:41:59,735
MATT: The blade loses its luster and stumbles into
the snow. (clinking) Hits the ground. It's out of

2218
02:41:59,735 --> 02:42:02,697
range. It doesn't hit anything solid; you don't go
with the blade.

2219
02:42:02,697 --> 02:42:04,216
LIAM: I'm going to push off him, then.

2220
02:42:04,216 --> 02:42:06,933
LAURA: You have wings.

2221
02:42:06,933 --> 02:42:11,938
LIAM: Yeah, I know that. What did I use? I used 40
feet of movement?

2222
02:42:11,938 --> 02:42:13,214
MATT: Correct.

2223
02:42:13,214 --> 02:42:20,947
LIAM: Okay. I don't know how much I have left. If
I'm hasted, I would have 120 total, but that's

2224
02:42:20,947 --> 02:42:24,974
halved, so 20 feet, because you said rough
terrain. But I'm in the air?

2225
02:42:24,974 --> 02:42:26,898
MATT: You're in the air, but there's a lot of
sleet and rain hitting.

2226
02:42:26,898 --> 02:42:33,014
LIAM: So ten feet. That's all right. I'm going to
keep moving away. I'm going to use all my movement

2227
02:42:33,014 --> 02:42:39,809
to get away from him and go away from his butt. I
should have a bonus action that I can use. The

2228
02:42:39,809 --> 02:42:41,747
rest of my movement, plus dash.

2229
02:42:41,747 --> 02:42:48,370
MATT: All right, before you get there, he's now
(roars). The angry scream. Vorugal's head swoops

2230
02:42:48,370 --> 02:42:54,151
around underneath and directly into your eyes as
you dart away with the blade. He spins in place

2231
02:42:54,151 --> 02:42:56,774
and bites at you as you're trying to pull away.

2232
02:42:56,774 --> 02:42:59,996
LIAM: I have advantage on dexterity saving throws.

2233
02:42:59,996 --> 02:43:06,191
MATT: Okay. This is a bite attack, so it doesn't
matter. So that is a 26?

2234
02:43:06,191 --> 02:43:07,525
LIAM: That hits.

2235
02:43:07,525 --> 02:43:19,719
MATT: All right. So you take 22 points of piercing
damage.

2236
02:43:19,719 --> 02:43:23,941
LIAM: Okay. Can I Uncanny Dodge this? Is this
melee?

2237
02:43:23,941 --> 02:43:36,130
MATT: Yeah, it's a melee attack, so you can do
that. Plus 14 points of cold damage.

2238
02:43:36,130 --> 02:43:41,922
LIAM: Which is halved because of my armor, so 26
down to 13 and seven. 20 total.

2239
02:43:41,922 --> 02:43:44,625
MATT: Yeah, 20 total, reduced by half because of
Uncanny Dodge, you said?

2240
02:43:44,625 --> 02:43:46,219
LIAM: Okay, so I'm down to 95.

2241
02:43:46,219 --> 02:43:52,742
MATT: Okay. So 95. You pull away to about there,
the rest of your movement?

2242
02:43:52,742 --> 02:43:58,846
LIAM: I want to use bonus action to dash. I don't
know if that gets me 60 feet away flying.

2243
02:43:58,846 --> 02:44:02,179
MATT: Flying, so it would be 30.

2244
02:44:02,179 --> 02:44:05,039
LIAM: It's 120 hasted, so 60 feet halved.

2245
02:44:05,039 --> 02:44:07,177
MATT: Okay, so yeah, you can get all the way to
the ground if you want to.

2246
02:44:07,177 --> 02:44:08,272
LIAM: Yes.

2247
02:44:08,272 --> 02:44:15,656
MATT: You get down to the ground about there
if you want. Okay. Now I need you to go ahead and

2248
02:44:15,656 --> 02:44:17,888
roll initiative and put you on the initiative
order.

2249
02:44:17,888 --> 02:44:19,337
LIAM: Yes, sir.

2250
02:44:19,337 --> 02:44:21,323
MATT: You have now engaged.

2251
02:44:21,323 --> 02:44:24,298
LIAM: Okay, so it's an 11.

2252
02:44:24,298 --> 02:44:25,864
MATT: An 11.

2253
02:44:25,864 --> 02:44:29,333
TALIESIN: Have you said anything in the earpiece
yet?

2254
02:44:29,333 --> 02:44:33,220
LIAM: Well, you guys saw it. People inside can't
hear me.

2255
02:44:33,220 --> 02:44:42,586
MATT: All right, so comes back to the top of the
round now. Yenk is currently climbing up the side.

2256
02:44:42,586 --> 02:44:53,997
Gets about halfway up the side. Is not entirely
up, but is clawing up, and you feel the impact

2257
02:44:53,997 --> 02:44:56,904
from where you're standing, Percy.

2258
02:44:56,904 --> 02:44:59,159
TALIESIN: I'm holding.

2259
02:44:59,159 --> 02:45:07,468
MATT: Going to use the rest of his action to climb
up. Gets all the way to the top of the ravine,

2260
02:45:07,468 --> 02:45:15,980
which is about at the same height that Vorugal is.
Based on your help, I need you to roll another

2261
02:45:15,980 --> 02:45:22,106
stealth check because you helped him for the last
half hour. You have advantage because she was

2262
02:45:22,106 --> 02:45:23,232
helping you.

2263
02:45:23,232 --> 02:45:33,939
TALIESIN: Oh! 13. 13, because I'm at a negative
one.

2264
02:45:33,939 --> 02:45:36,523
LAURA: 13? That's worse than it was before!

2265
02:45:36,523 --> 02:45:46,221
MATT: Yenk gets to the top and turns around and
sees Vorugal off to the side, glances down and

2266
02:45:46,221 --> 02:45:54,274
goes (foreign words). And is going to make a giant
bowling underhand fist punch

2267
02:45:54,274 --> 02:45:55,714
right towards you, Percy.

2268
02:45:55,714 --> 02:46:03,231
TALIESIN: I was holding ready. Can I try and beat
his initiative and get a shot off first?

2269
02:46:03,231 --> 02:46:05,526
MATT: As a reaction right now, you can go ahead
and take a shot.

2270
02:46:05,526 --> 02:46:07,610
MARISHA: It's time to go.

2271
02:46:07,610 --> 02:46:10,021
SAM: Has it been two rounds?

2272
02:46:10,021 --> 02:46:11,404
TALIESIN: Jenga!

2273
02:46:11,404 --> 02:46:13,267
MATT: It's been more than two rounds since this
started.

2274
02:46:13,267 --> 02:46:14,753
SAM: How about since I looked last?

2275
02:46:14,753 --> 02:46:16,995
MATT: It's been almost a round.

2276
02:46:16,995 --> 02:46:18,579
LAURA: Can I see all this happening?

2277
02:46:18,579 --> 02:46:20,532
MATT: You do watch this happening.

2278
02:46:20,532 --> 02:46:26,427
LAURA: I'm going to take an arrow and shoot it. I
can see the door, but it's not going to register

2279
02:46:26,427 --> 02:46:27,795
on a magical door, is it?

2280
02:46:27,795 --> 02:46:28,917
MATT: No.

2281
02:46:28,917 --> 02:46:30,211
LAURA: Fuck.

2282
02:46:30,211 --> 02:46:32,821
MARISHA: We're about to pop out.

2283
02:46:32,821 --> 02:46:38,619
LIAM: Hey, B-T-dubs, I've just learned that
Whisper can only bamf me once per round, right?

2284
02:46:38,619 --> 02:46:43,618
MATT: It needs to solidly hit something.

2285
02:46:43,618 --> 02:46:47,448
LIAM: To stick within 60 feet. Got it.

2286
02:46:47,448 --> 02:46:50,866
MATT: You can't throw it as hard as you can and
it'll teleport you wherever it lands. It has to

2287
02:46:50,866 --> 02:46:52,337
impact.

2288
02:46:52,337 --> 02:46:54,954
TALIESIN: I'm going to press a torso push with
this, by the way.

2289
02:46:54,954 --> 02:46:56,130
MATT: Okay.

2290
02:46:56,130 --> 02:47:12,777
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to press a torso push.
Better! 33. I don't even know why I bother. He's

2291
02:47:12,777 --> 02:47:15,351
automatically pushed ten feet away from me.

2292
02:47:15,351 --> 02:47:24,246
MATT: He does still get the one hit on you, which
is 27.

2293
02:47:24,246 --> 02:47:25,562
TALIESIN: Oh, that hits.

2294
02:47:25,562 --> 02:47:37,516
MATT: You take 23 points of bludgeoning damage
from the fist, and then the fist seems to sparkle

2295
02:47:37,516 --> 02:47:40,777
with electrical energy as it goes to impact you.

2296
02:47:40,777 --> 02:47:42,125
TALIESIN: That's magic.

2297
02:47:42,125 --> 02:47:47,769
MATT: It is not a magic spell, no. You take six
points of lightning damage.

2298
02:47:47,769 --> 02:47:49,745
MARISHA: Yenk is on top?

2299
02:47:49,745 --> 02:47:52,275
MATT: Yenk is at the top of the ravine.

2300
02:47:52,275 --> 02:47:53,748
MARISHA: Isn't Percy halfway down?

2301
02:47:53,748 --> 02:47:59,879
MATT: Yenk got up to where he would see him and then
saw him as he was passing by.

2302
02:47:59,879 --> 02:48:01,983
Stopped to slam him.

2303
02:48:01,983 --> 02:48:10,694
TALIESIN: So 23 plus six. That's fine. The
lightning damage, the cloak doesn't absorb that?

2304
02:48:10,694 --> 02:48:11,862
MATT: No.

2305
02:48:11,862 --> 02:48:24,112
TALIESIN: Okay. Then I'm going to do my damage on
him, which is new to me. That's terrible. That's

2306
02:48:24,112 --> 02:48:31,162
11 points of damage, plus two points of psychic
damage.

2307
02:48:31,162 --> 02:48:36,752
MATT: 13 points of damage. Gets pushed back.
Because he's still holding onto the edge, he has

2308
02:48:36,752 --> 02:48:42,415
to see if he can-- No, it does not. Yenk
loses grip from the blast of the gun after

2309
02:48:42,415 --> 02:48:48,467
punching you, stumbles back. Claw hits the edge
and falls down prone to the ground at the base of

2310
02:48:48,467 --> 02:48:53,227
the ravine. 40 feet.

2311
02:48:53,227 --> 02:48:54,580
TALIESIN: 50 feet.

2312
02:48:54,580 --> 02:49:03,969
MATT: 50 feet. Taking an additional
16 points of bludgeoning damage, which is halved.

2313
02:49:03,969 --> 02:49:09,085
TALIESIN: Do I join the initiative order?

2314
02:49:09,085 --> 02:49:10,525
MATT: You do. Go ahead and roll initiative.

2315
02:49:10,525 --> 02:49:14,610
TALIESIN: 21.

2316
02:49:14,610 --> 02:49:25,538
MATT: 21. All right. That ends Yenk's turn.
Vorugal does not get the ice breath back. However,

2317
02:49:25,538 --> 02:49:31,933
does see both of you in the vicinity.

2318
02:49:31,933 --> 02:49:33,687
LAURA: Me?

2319
02:49:33,687 --> 02:49:38,454
MATT: Does not see you, no, but it sees Vax and
Percy.

2320
02:49:38,454 --> 02:49:40,468
TALIESIN: It sees me? All right.

2321
02:49:40,468 --> 02:49:45,202
MATT: The blast of the gun and the impact and the
whole encounter with Yenk exposed you. It's going

2322
02:49:45,202 --> 02:49:52,736
to use its action to use Frightful Presence, so
I need both Percy and Vax-- and Vex, actually,

2323
02:49:52,736 --> 02:49:57,887
because you're still within the range-- to make a
wisdom saving throw. You have advantage. You guys

2324
02:49:57,887 --> 02:50:00,835
are immune to frightening, so it doesn't actually
affect you regardless, so don't worry about it.

2325
02:50:00,835 --> 02:50:02,809
LIAM: Don't roll?

2326
02:50:02,809 --> 02:50:10,189
MATT: Don't have to roll; you're immune to fear.
Yenk makes his saving throw, so Yenk is not

2327
02:50:10,189 --> 02:50:11,976
afraid, either.

2328
02:50:11,976 --> 02:50:17,064
MARISHA: Thanks, Pike! Should we pop out? Should
we do this?

2329
02:50:17,064 --> 02:50:18,661
LAURA: No, not yet!

2330
02:50:18,661 --> 02:50:22,615
SAM: After 12 seconds, I will look. I will stick
my head out and look again.

2331
02:50:22,615 --> 02:50:27,220
MATT: Vorugal is now watching the battlefield and
seeing the people that have been revealed.

2332
02:50:27,220 --> 02:50:33,396
Vorugal's going to go up a little higher.

2333
02:50:33,396 --> 02:50:43,590
SAM: He's a total not-a-good-hunter. I thought he
enjoyed the hunt!

2334
02:50:43,590 --> 02:50:48,539
MATT: He doesn't enjoy being ambushed or in a
fight that he can't win.

2335
02:50:48,539 --> 02:50:51,324
SAM: I've poked my head out to look.

2336
02:50:51,324 --> 02:50:55,841
MATT: Okay. You look out and you see Vorugal way
high in the air. You see Yenk on the ground, and

2337
02:50:55,841 --> 02:51:00,587
you see a couple of your companions less stealthed
than they were before.

2338
02:51:00,587 --> 02:51:02,650
MARISHA: What's it looking like, Scanlan?

2339
02:51:02,650 --> 02:51:10,862
SAM: I pop my head back in and I tell them: shit's
going down. Should we go out or let this play out

2340
02:51:10,862 --> 02:51:13,264
a bit? Yenk is not dead.

2341
02:51:13,264 --> 02:51:14,760
TALIESIN: Jenga!

2342
02:51:14,760 --> 02:51:17,875
LAURA: They can't hear you, Percy. I can hear you,
but they can't.

2343
02:51:17,875 --> 02:51:20,894
SAM: Yenk is not dead, so we will be fighting
Yenk, as well.

2344
02:51:20,894 --> 02:51:23,327
ASHLEY: We can't leave them out there alone.

2345
02:51:23,327 --> 02:51:24,965
SAM: I guess we go.

2346
02:51:24,965 --> 02:51:30,659
ASHLEY: Right? Are we going to leave them out
there to die?

2347
02:51:30,659 --> 02:51:38,692
MARISHA: I can try and ground him. It's a strength
saving throw, though; it's going to be tough.

2348
02:51:38,692 --> 02:51:41,004
LAURA: Try and ground Vorugal? Try it.

2349
02:51:41,004 --> 02:51:44,403
MARISHA: I say, excuse me, Scanlan.

2350
02:51:44,403 --> 02:51:47,278
MATT: Those who are entering the fray, roll
initiative.

2351
02:51:47,278 --> 02:51:51,466
SAM: I'm going to leave the mansion and start
running.

2352
02:51:51,466 --> 02:51:53,076
MARISHA: Son of a fuck!

2353
02:51:53,076 --> 02:51:56,176
SAM: 14.

2354
02:51:56,176 --> 02:51:59,698
MATT: 14. What did you get, Keyleth?

2355
02:51:59,698 --> 02:52:01,231
MARISHA: Four.

2356
02:52:01,231 --> 02:52:04,945
SAM: That's top of the round!

2357
02:52:04,945 --> 02:52:08,916
MATT: Anyone else? Grog?

2358
02:52:08,916 --> 02:52:12,253
TRAVIS: 15.

2359
02:52:12,253 --> 02:52:14,266
MATT: 15. All righty.

2360
02:52:14,266 --> 02:52:16,783
LIAM: You get advantage, right?

2361
02:52:16,783 --> 02:52:18,048
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2362
02:52:18,048 --> 02:52:19,682
MATT: Vex, do you want to roll?

2363
02:52:19,682 --> 02:52:22,274
LAURA: I guess as soon as I see everybody run out,
I would start attacking.

2364
02:52:22,274 --> 02:52:26,042
MATT: Pike, you as well?

2365
02:52:26,042 --> 02:52:27,443
ASHLEY: Five.

2366
02:52:27,497 --> 02:52:29,009
SAM: Yeah, this is great.

2367
02:52:29,009 --> 02:52:31,890
TRAVIS: Wow. Fuck me.

2368
02:52:31,890 --> 02:52:34,614
LIAM: Oh jeepers, we're going to die.

2369
02:52:34,614 --> 02:52:40,967
SAM: Don't worry, we've got our secret weapon. Our
secret weapon, by the way, now wants to kill all

2370
02:52:40,967 --> 02:52:42,254
of us.

2371
02:52:42,254 --> 02:52:44,436
MARISHA: Did he lose his save against it?

2372
02:52:44,436 --> 02:52:46,527
SAM: He wants to kill us.

2373
02:52:46,527 --> 02:52:51,129
TALIESIN: Except that he also has a dragon to
contend with, so as long as we keep it a bigger

2374
02:52:51,129 --> 02:52:56,304
threat than us, I think he'll keep his
concentration where it is.

2375
02:52:56,304 --> 02:52:58,638
MARISHA: We should still try to stay out of all
this.

2376
02:52:58,638 --> 02:53:03,870
MATT: Everyone who has rolled initiative will be
on the next initiative order. Vax, you're

2377
02:53:03,870 --> 02:53:05,711
finishing up this round.

2378
02:53:05,711 --> 02:53:12,751
LIAM: Oh, I am? I would like to throw Whisper to
the rock I was initially hiding behind

2379
02:53:12,751 --> 02:53:14,161
and bamf there.

2380
02:53:14,161 --> 02:53:15,667
MATT: Roll an attack roll.

2381
02:53:15,667 --> 02:53:25,910
LIAM: Yeah. Sure, that's 25. I would like to use
my bonus action to hide behind that rock.

2382
02:53:25,910 --> 02:53:29,620
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll a stealth check.

2383
02:53:29,620 --> 02:53:43,043
LIAM: That is a 25. Can I hold my last action?

2384
02:53:43,043 --> 02:53:50,719
MATT: You could hold an action to do one thing
with a trigger, sure.

2385
02:53:50,719 --> 02:53:53,615
You can use your hasted action.

2386
02:53:53,615 --> 02:53:58,084
LIAM: I'm going to stay put. Stay hidden.

2387
02:53:58,084 --> 02:54:05,443
MATT: All right, that brings us to the top of the
round. Percy, you're at the top.

2388
02:54:05,443 --> 02:54:22,337
TALIESIN: Oh boy. Okay. I'm going to take a wing
shot at that dragon to try and drop him. Come on.

2389
02:54:22,337 --> 02:54:23,727
Natural 20.

2390
02:54:23,727 --> 02:54:25,263
LAURA: (yelling) Yes!

2391
02:54:25,263 --> 02:54:28,417
ASHLEY: There it is.

2392
02:54:28,417 --> 02:54:33,321
TALIESIN: Does the 1d6 also double? Is it all dice
or just the standard damage?

2393
02:54:33,321 --> 02:54:34,662
MATT: No, the dice, as well.

2394
02:54:34,662 --> 02:54:36,804
ASHLEY: No mercy Percy!

2395
02:54:36,804 --> 02:54:38,136
MARISHA: You're my favorite.

2396
02:54:38,136 --> 02:54:51,095
TALIESIN: Oh, you say that now. Let's see how this
goes. First the damage, which is not bad. 16

2397
02:54:51,095 --> 02:54:57,542
points of normal damage and 11 points of psychic
damage, and he's prone.

2398
02:54:57,542 --> 02:54:59,408
MATT: What's the total on that one?

2399
02:54:59,408 --> 02:55:03,864
TALIESIN: 16 and 11. That's 27.

2400
02:55:03,864 --> 02:55:06,891
MATT: All right. Well, it has to make a strength
save.

2401
02:55:06,891 --> 02:55:12,718
TALIESIN: No, not against the wing shot. Oh,
strength saving throw; you're right. Against a DC

2402
02:55:12,718 --> 02:55:14,318
of 19.

2403
02:55:14,318 --> 02:55:19,232
MATT: That is a success. 21.

2404
02:55:19,232 --> 02:55:32,558
TALIESIN: Again. That'll hit. 31 to hit.

2405
02:55:32,558 --> 02:55:34,776
MATT: 31 will hit, yep.

2406
02:55:34,776 --> 02:55:46,941
TALIESIN: Same thing. 15 points of damage plus one
psychic, so 16.

2407
02:55:46,941 --> 02:55:48,685
MATT: 16, and what was the DC again?

2408
02:55:48,685 --> 02:55:50,394
TALIESIN: 19.

2409
02:55:50,394 --> 02:55:57,937
MATT: 19? Just fails with an 18, so instead of
being knocked prone it drops 60 feet per round.

2410
02:55:57,937 --> 02:56:01,795
TALIESIN: So it's dropping now?

2411
02:56:01,795 --> 02:56:05,500
MATT: We'll say for now, yes, it's dropping.

2412
02:56:05,500 --> 02:56:12,658
SAM: Come on, Yenk. Kill that thing.

2413
02:56:12,658 --> 02:56:16,530
(plastic platform clatters)

2414
02:56:16,530 --> 02:56:18,771
SAM: He died!

2415
02:56:18,771 --> 02:56:24,184
TALIESIN: What should I make it have difficulty with?
Not saving, but checks.

2416
02:56:24,184 --> 02:56:28,019
SAM: He's not going to have to check anything.

2417
02:56:28,019 --> 02:56:29,715
TALIESIN: You never know.

2418
02:56:29,715 --> 02:56:34,053
MATT: There. All right, Percy. That was your
second shot.

2419
02:56:34,053 --> 02:56:49,305
TALIESIN: One more shot. First, I'm going to Hex
the dragon. I'm going to give him disadvantage

2420
02:56:49,305 --> 02:56:57,397
against strength checks. And I'm going to shoot
him with a sharpshooter shot for my last shot.

2421
02:56:57,397 --> 02:57:04,507
Come on. Yeah! 29.

2422
02:57:04,507 --> 02:57:06,248
MATT: 29 hits.

2423
02:57:06,248 --> 02:57:27,508
TALIESIN: This is good. (excited yell) 18. Oh my
god, okay. 28 plus five psychic, so that's 33

2424
02:57:27,508 --> 02:57:36,517
points of damage, plus another d6. Plus another
five necro.

2425
02:57:36,517 --> 02:57:43,315
MATT: Nice, 38. As you're aiming up as Vorugal's
getting further and further away, you aim up and

2426
02:57:43,315 --> 02:57:47,659
fire. One side hits it and wings it ever so
slightly, the second shot you aim the other side

2427
02:57:47,659 --> 02:57:52,658
it actually hits the joint and causes the wing to
flap. Vorugal tumbles out of the air for a second

2428
02:57:52,658 --> 02:57:58,550
and just manages to catch himself and the final
shot impacts right in the back of the skull spines

2429
02:57:58,550 --> 02:58:03,087
and shatters part of the bone and ice off of it,
leaving a nice, fresh wound in the

2430
02:58:03,087 --> 02:58:04,527
back of the head.

2431
02:58:04,527 --> 02:58:07,486
TALIESIN: Now, I'm going to take cover in my
little cove.

2432
02:58:07,486 --> 02:58:11,034
LIAM: I'd like to think of you driving and cutting
someone off on the 101 and going,

2433
02:58:11,034 --> 02:58:12,414
"Plus five necro."

2434
02:58:12,414 --> 02:58:14,073
TALIESIN: Plus five necro, motherfucker.

2435
02:58:14,073 --> 02:58:15,982
MATT: All right.

2436
02:58:15,982 --> 02:58:17,826
TALIESIN: He's checking the sheet. Oh no.

2437
02:58:17,826 --> 02:58:20,119
LAURA: Oh no, what are you looking at?

2438
02:58:20,119 --> 02:58:22,516
TALIESIN: It means there's a very angry dragon now
that's looking at me.

2439
02:58:22,516 --> 02:58:31,255
MATT: Okay, so Kima, who's now eager to get out
there goes, "Okay. All right. Let's do this."

2440
02:58:31,255 --> 02:58:44,705
She's going to cast Aura of Vitality on herself as
her action. Then she goes running through the

2441
02:58:44,705 --> 02:58:53,680
center of the portal, leaps out, turns the corner
to there and stops and goes, "Oh shit."

2442
02:58:53,680 --> 02:58:57,518
That's her turn.

2443
02:58:57,518 --> 02:58:59,152
MARISHA: That's her turn?

2444
02:58:59,152 --> 02:59:05,766
MATT: She's just entering the fray and did a
preparation spell as part of that. Ending Kima's

2445
02:59:05,766 --> 02:59:17,942
turn, let's see here. From out of seemingly
nowhere in particular, you see a flash of

2446
02:59:17,942 --> 02:59:30,488
electrical energy arcing from one of the nearby
sections of the crevasse alcove. The bolt of

2447
02:59:30,488 --> 02:59:37,280
energy arcs out and slams into Vorugal, who does
not make the save, not seeing it there.

2448
02:59:37,280 --> 02:59:43,739
TALIESIN: All right. We've got a game.

2449
02:59:43,739 --> 02:59:48,676
SAM: Five points of damage!

2450
02:59:48,676 --> 02:59:50,989
MARISHA: What are you good for?

2451
02:59:50,989 --> 02:59:54,787
MATT: That'll be 41 points of lightning damage.

2452
02:59:54,787 --> 02:59:56,848
SAM: Okay!

2453
02:59:56,848 --> 03:00:05,530
MARISHA: Remember, she learned from the druids a
bunch of fucking nature shit.

2454
03:00:05,530 --> 03:00:10,514
MATT: One of the arcs tries to reach for Yenk and
manages to disperse before it can get to it. It's

2455
03:00:10,514 --> 03:00:18,266
not quite within range, but that finishes wherever
that lightning source was. Yenk angrily is going

2456
03:00:18,266 --> 03:00:26,726
to stand up and turn. It is going to attempt to
run and grab up at Vorugal again.

2457
03:00:26,726 --> 03:00:28,715
MARISHA and SAM: Come on, Yenk!

2458
03:00:28,715 --> 03:00:39,133
MATT: Leaps and misses, (impact) landing right
next to the rock. That's a natural 20 on a

2459
03:00:39,133 --> 03:00:43,903
perception check as it lands (impact) and looks
over right into your face.

2460
03:00:43,903 --> 03:00:47,541
LIAM: Hi.

2461
03:00:47,541 --> 03:00:49,617
MATT: Yenk is now aware of you.

2462
03:00:49,617 --> 03:00:51,827
TALIESIN: He's just noticing everybody.

2463
03:00:51,827 --> 03:01:00,686
MATT: At the end of Yenk's turn-- that's not going
to help him right now. That's going to end that.

2464
03:01:00,686 --> 03:01:17,097
Vorugal's turn. Breath does return this time.
Vorugal, from up here, is going to send ice breath

2465
03:01:17,097 --> 03:01:26,896
across the entire ground, sweeping up across both
Yenk and Vax. I need you to make a constitution

2466
03:01:26,896 --> 03:01:28,242
saving throw.

2467
03:01:28,242 --> 03:01:30,140
LIAM: Could I use Evasion for this?

2468
03:01:30,140 --> 03:01:34,040
MATT: No, it's constitution.

2469
03:01:34,040 --> 03:01:42,741
LIAM: All right. I'm going to use Luck. First Luck
of the day. All right, 13.

2470
03:01:42,741 --> 03:01:47,732
MATT: 13? No. You suffer 72 points of cold damage,
halved because of your resistance.

2471
03:01:47,732 --> 03:01:50,024
ASHLEY: How much, again?

2472
03:01:50,024 --> 03:01:56,023
MATT: 72, but halved because of your cold
resistance. 36 points of cold damage to you.

2473
03:01:56,023 --> 03:01:59,534
TRAVIS: Um. What?

2474
03:01:59,534 --> 03:02:04,365
MATT: Vorugal's then going to take higher up into
the air.

2475
03:02:04,365 --> 03:02:08,071
TALIESIN: Can he do that already, even recovering
from the prone?

2476
03:02:08,071 --> 03:02:13,687
MATT: Yeah. The idea with prone is that unless
there's something that maintains or it can't

2477
03:02:13,687 --> 03:02:20,820
improve its movement past its next turn, it
continues to fall. That's going to finish

2478
03:02:20,820 --> 03:02:23,322
Vorugal's turn. Grog, you're up.

2479
03:02:23,322 --> 03:02:25,007
TRAVIS: I'm up?

2480
03:02:25,007 --> 03:02:26,851
MATT: Yep. You're still inside the mansion.

2481
03:02:26,851 --> 03:02:30,633
SAM: Do not draw attention to yourself, friend.

2482
03:02:30,633 --> 03:02:34,641
TRAVIS: Fuck that. We're all going down. I take
the Titanstone Knuckles and I smash them together,

2483
03:02:34,641 --> 03:02:43,068
and I use the Enlarge, and I will burst out of the
mansion in a rage.

2484
03:02:43,068 --> 03:02:46,917
LIAM: Big Grog!

2485
03:02:46,917 --> 03:03:00,352
MATT: So that's 30 feet of movement. You have 20
more feet, if you want.

2486
03:03:00,352 --> 03:03:02,052
TRAVIS: No, remember it's halved.

2487
03:03:02,052 --> 03:03:09,043
MATT: All right. Then there, that's 25. That's
your movement. The gauntlets took your bonus

2488
03:03:09,043 --> 03:03:13,371
action. You can still use your action to dash, if
you want to move further. Or do you want to stay

2489
03:03:13,371 --> 03:03:15,171
there and hold your action?

2490
03:03:15,171 --> 03:03:19,277
LIAM: Wait. I'm sorry. Yenk knew where I was. Did
the dragon know where I was, too?

2491
03:03:19,277 --> 03:03:25,743
MATT: It's funny. It hit Yenk and the whole thing,
but the dragon has an aerial view, and you have a

2492
03:03:25,743 --> 03:03:31,069
single rock that you went behind to hide, and it
saw you move behind the rock. You have to break

2493
03:03:31,069 --> 03:03:32,997
eye contact to stealth.

2494
03:03:32,997 --> 03:03:39,363
TRAVIS: I'll use that dash to keep moving towards
the ice wall, towards you. Maybe two or three

2495
03:03:39,363 --> 03:03:41,280
squares. That will be my turn.

2496
03:03:41,280 --> 03:03:49,684
MATT: You can get there. Hulking, axe gripped,
giant Grog is leaping through the snow. (impacts)

2497
03:03:49,684 --> 03:03:57,067
You're two-thirds the size of Yenk, right now,
which is crazy. All right, that ends Grog's turn.

2498
03:03:57,067 --> 03:03:58,535
Scanlan, you're up.

2499
03:03:58,535 --> 03:04:02,112
SAM: Me? I'm still invisible. I'm going to leave
the mansion.

2500
03:04:02,112 --> 03:04:04,650
MATT: You're not still invisible, because you cast
Dominate Monster.

2501
03:04:04,650 --> 03:04:11,113
SAM: No, I cast Invisibility after I cast Dominate
Monster. I'm going to leave the mansion and

2502
03:04:11,113 --> 03:04:15,604
clockwise around the game board.

2503
03:04:15,604 --> 03:04:21,464
MATT: That's as far as you can get, there, with
your reduced movement.

2504
03:04:21,464 --> 03:04:25,165
SAM: If I inspire, that kills my invisibility?

2505
03:04:25,165 --> 03:04:39,135
MATT: Technically, no. It's not an attack or an
action, so I would say it wouldn't. It may give

2506
03:04:39,135 --> 03:04:40,926
away your location.

2507
03:04:40,926 --> 03:04:44,857
SAM: Then I will use my bonus action to keep
moving. To dash?

2508
03:04:44,857 --> 03:04:49,069
MATT: To dash is your action. You can do that,
yeah. Your bonus action,

2509
03:04:49,069 --> 03:04:50,724
that's only a rogue ability.

2510
03:04:50,724 --> 03:04:54,324
SAM: I will dash and keep moving away and that
way.

2511
03:04:54,324 --> 03:04:57,243
MATT: This way? Okay. That's your action.

2512
03:04:57,243 --> 03:04:58,608
SAM: That's it?

2513
03:04:58,608 --> 03:05:01,720
MATT: Yeah. It's big, heavy snow and slick ice.
You're having to be careful.

2514
03:05:01,720 --> 03:05:07,475
SAM: Okay. I don't want to draw attention to
myself, so that'll be that.

2515
03:05:07,475 --> 03:05:09,514
MATT: All righty.

2516
03:05:09,514 --> 03:05:16,064
SAM: I'm only within range of Kima. I'm not going
to give away my position to inspire her.

2517
03:05:16,064 --> 03:05:18,270
MATT: All right, finishing your turn. Vax, you're
up.

2518
03:05:18,270 --> 03:05:32,092
LIAM: Holy shit. Yeah, I'm going to take to the
air. Holy shit. I'm going to fly within 60 feet of

2519
03:05:32,092 --> 03:05:36,222
Vorugal. 55 feet away.

2520
03:05:36,222 --> 03:05:46,307
MATT: That will put you about there. Okay. Yenk
has a reach of ten because his arms are long, and

2521
03:05:46,307 --> 03:05:50,821
you're within his combat range, so as soon as you
fly up, he swings out with his fist to attempt to

2522
03:05:50,821 --> 03:05:52,058
impact you.

2523
03:05:52,058 --> 03:05:56,064
LIAM: All right, Uncanny Dodge.

2524
03:05:56,064 --> 03:06:00,690
MATT: As you're with your wings, dagger out, this
fist comes swinging like a battering ram from the

2525
03:06:00,690 --> 03:06:11,117
side. That is 22 to hit. Misses. (whoosh) You just
barely dodge out of the way. You feel the force of

2526
03:06:11,117 --> 03:06:16,686
it, the wind batter a bunch of errant falling
sleet and snow across your face, but you rush

2527
03:06:16,686 --> 03:06:20,777
past, the hasted bonus saving you on that one.

2528
03:06:20,777 --> 03:06:22,762
LIAM: Okay, so how far did I just go?

2529
03:06:22,762 --> 03:06:25,469
MATT: That would have been 55 feet.

2530
03:06:25,469 --> 03:06:31,581
LIAM: 55 feet. I can go 120 in one action, so
that's my movement.

2531
03:06:31,581 --> 03:06:33,295
MATT: Halved, yeah.

2532
03:06:33,295 --> 03:06:40,147
LIAM: Halved, but 120, so that's my
movement, total. I'm going to throw Whisper in his

2533
03:06:40,147 --> 03:06:42,989
face. I'm not going to bamf there; I'm just going
to throw the dagger.

2534
03:06:42,989 --> 03:06:44,303
MATT: Into Vorugal?

2535
03:06:44,303 --> 03:06:50,428
LIAM: Vorugal's face. That's halfsies, so I'm
going to roll it again. That's way better. That is

2536
03:06:50,428 --> 03:06:53,688
a 32.

2537
03:06:53,688 --> 03:06:56,177
MATT: That hits. How many Luck have you used, by
the way?

2538
03:06:56,177 --> 03:07:01,961
LIAM: One. That is 12 plus the psychic damage.

2539
03:07:01,961 --> 03:07:04,412
MATT: I thought you used Luck once before, today.

2540
03:07:04,412 --> 03:07:06,535
LIAM: I don't think so. Not since waking up.

2541
03:07:06,535 --> 03:07:08,288
MATT: It would have been yesterday. You're right.

2542
03:07:08,288 --> 03:07:17,545
LIAM: 12, plus two is 14, and I'm going to cast
Divine Smite-- no, I'm not. No, just 14 of damage,

2543
03:07:17,545 --> 03:07:27,590
so that's movement, action. My next action I'm
going to use to fly under him, halfway between

2544
03:07:27,590 --> 03:07:32,458
Percival and the gang, and land on the wall.

2545
03:07:32,458 --> 03:07:34,029
MATT: Land on the wall this way?

2546
03:07:34,029 --> 03:07:37,562
LIAM: Yeah. Now, that wall is higher up than it
looks, so I'm really flying straight, right?

2547
03:07:37,562 --> 03:07:45,400
MATT: Correct. We'll say you're about there,
technically.

2548
03:07:45,400 --> 03:07:53,522
LIAM: Yes, and then for a bonus action, my last
spell slot, I'm going to cast Shield of Faith on

2549
03:07:53,522 --> 03:07:57,312
my fucking self for a plus two to AC.

2550
03:07:57,312 --> 03:08:02,129
MATT: There you go. Ending Vax's turn. 
Pike, you're up.

2551
03:08:02,129 --> 03:08:12,240
ASHLEY: Yikes. Well. Are we outside the mansion?

2552
03:08:12,240 --> 03:08:16,181
MATT: No, you're inside the mansion right now. You
just watched Grog, Kima, and Scanlan all dart out

2553
03:08:16,181 --> 03:08:18,590
of it. Well, you didn't see Scanlan leave. Scanlan
vanished.

2554
03:08:18,590 --> 03:08:20,133
ASHLEY: Scanlan vanished.

2555
03:08:20,133 --> 03:08:23,581
MATT: It's you, Trinket, and Keyleth.

2556
03:08:23,581 --> 03:08:25,804
LAURA: Did I ever get on the initiative order?

2557
03:08:25,804 --> 03:08:38,085
MATT: What did you roll? Ten, right? You'd
technically be after Vax. We'll do your turn after

2558
03:08:38,085 --> 03:08:39,900
this, but you're after Vax.

2559
03:08:39,900 --> 03:08:46,368
ASHLEY: I'm going to pop out. Maybe I can stay in
there and do this, in the door, and try to cast

2560
03:08:46,368 --> 03:08:48,081
Divine Intervention.

2561
03:08:48,081 --> 03:08:56,428
MATT: Divine Intervention? All right, so you step
out and you see this chaos happen: the dragon in

2562
03:08:56,428 --> 03:09:03,076
the air, the fiend on the side, swinging and
barely missing a flying Vax, who swoops past in

2563
03:09:03,076 --> 03:09:07,522
the middle of this sleet storm. You close your
eyes and concentrate, holding your holy symbol,

2564
03:09:07,522 --> 03:09:13,013
praying that Sarenrae has the ability to reach
beyond the Divine Gate and lend you her strength

2565
03:09:13,013 --> 03:09:16,227
temporarily. I need you to roll a d10.

2566
03:09:16,227 --> 03:09:19,073
MARISHA: Man, how awesome would this be?

2567
03:09:19,073 --> 03:09:21,836
LAURA: It would be insane.

2568
03:09:21,836 --> 03:09:24,218
MATT: What did you roll?

2569
03:09:24,218 --> 03:09:25,737
ASHLEY: A ten?

2570
03:09:25,737 --> 03:09:27,101
MATT: A zero?

2571
03:09:27,101 --> 03:09:28,653
LAURA: Yeah, a zero.

2572
03:09:28,653 --> 03:09:34,374
MARISHA: (excited gasping) Shut the fuck up! She
has to roll under her level, which she did.

2573
03:09:34,374 --> 03:09:36,081
MATT: So this succeeded.

2574
03:09:36,081 --> 03:09:38,331
MARISHA: Shut the fuck up, Ashley!

2575
03:09:38,331 --> 03:09:46,053
MATT: So as you clutch your holy symbol,
concentrating, hoping that she's there, feeling

2576
03:09:46,053 --> 03:09:52,108
the division between the gods and their followers
since the Divergence occurred. You've reached out

2577
03:09:52,108 --> 03:09:56,328
to her a number of times. You look up through the
darkness of your closed eyes, and you see a light,

2578
03:09:56,328 --> 03:10:01,881
a beacon open. The clouds part, and suddenly the
sound of rain goes away. The sound of all the

2579
03:10:01,881 --> 03:10:08,526
chaos goes away, and it's just warmth and quiet,
and you watch as Sarenrae's hand comes down and

2580
03:10:08,526 --> 03:10:18,366
touches your forehead, and with your closed eyes,
and says, "I'll do what I can." As she drifts away

2581
03:10:18,366 --> 03:10:24,911
and smiles, you watch as her hand turns into a
fist, and she looks up and disappears into the

2582
03:10:24,911 --> 03:10:31,798
light. As you open your eyes, you now see up in
the sky above Vorugal, the clouds that are dark,

2583
03:10:31,798 --> 03:10:39,897
a sparkle of divine energy begins to swirl. As it
grows stronger and stronger, the clouds suddenly

2584
03:10:39,897 --> 03:10:47,185
part, and a giant column of divine energy (boom)
slams down, right on top of Vorugal. Vorugal looks

2585
03:10:47,185 --> 03:10:52,687
up just in time to try to move out of the way
before it slams him back. Does not make his dex

2586
03:10:52,687 --> 03:11:02,483
save with a roll of five. Vorugal suffers 50
points of divine damage

2587
03:11:02,483 --> 03:11:05,754
and is slammed onto the ground.

2588
03:11:05,754 --> 03:11:09,648
(cheering)

2589
03:11:09,648 --> 03:11:11,182
TALIESIN: Stay down!

2590
03:11:11,182 --> 03:11:13,526
MARISHA: Yes!

2591
03:11:13,526 --> 03:11:19,335
Holy fuck! Pike! That was amazing!

2592
03:11:19,335 --> 03:11:21,230
ASHLEY: Oh boy!

2593
03:11:21,230 --> 03:11:23,586
LIAM: Action figure is down.

2594
03:11:23,586 --> 03:11:35,093
MATT: Additional 26 points of bludgeoning damage.
As the light column slams Vorugal to the ground,

2595
03:11:35,093 --> 03:11:39,829
you can see some of the ice and snow underneath
melts immediately, and what was once a column, you

2596
03:11:39,829 --> 03:11:46,878
can see now looks like a giant fist made of
spiritual energy that then withdraws slowly off

2597
03:11:46,878 --> 03:11:51,041
the back of Vorugal and then dissipates before the
clouds close up once more.

2598
03:11:51,041 --> 03:11:58,093
ASHLEY: Yes! It worked!

2599
03:11:58,093 --> 03:12:00,396
MATT: That's your movement and your action.

2600
03:12:00,396 --> 03:12:14,148
ASHLEY: For a bonus action, I would like to place
a spiritual weapon at the back of his neck, since

2601
03:12:14,148 --> 03:12:20,042
he's on the ground. And I would like it to be a
very large flaming sword.

2602
03:12:20,042 --> 03:12:26,012
MATT: Okay. You watch as the hand of Sarenrae
dissipates, some of the energy that's residual

2603
03:12:26,012 --> 03:12:33,885
there lingers, and then forms into a flaming sword
of pure golden-white energy. It is now hovering

2604
03:12:33,885 --> 03:12:38,640
over the currently slammed-down, broken-looking
body of Vorugal.

2605
03:12:38,640 --> 03:12:41,545
SAM: She's the best one of the group!

2606
03:12:41,545 --> 03:12:44,115
(laughter)

2607
03:12:44,115 --> 03:12:59,780
MATT: All righty. That was... What level spell was
that, again, Pike? Second level. Got it. All right,

2608
03:12:59,780 --> 03:13:11,358
so make a melee spell attack against Vorugal. Roll
a d20 and add, I believe it's 11. Roll a d20 and

2609
03:13:11,358 --> 03:13:17,128
add 11 to it as the flaming blade attempts to
strike down towards Vorugal.

2610
03:13:17,128 --> 03:13:18,529
ASHLEY: 25.

2611
03:13:18,529 --> 03:13:21,843
MATT: 25 hits. Go ahead and roll 1d8 plus five.

2612
03:13:21,843 --> 03:13:32,302
ASHLEY: Okay, well, six. Sarenrae did the damage.

2613
03:13:32,302 --> 03:13:35,707
MATT: Six points of divine damage.

2614
03:13:35,707 --> 03:13:38,441
ASHLEY: Sarenrae does 50 points of damage, and I
do six.

2615
03:13:38,441 --> 03:13:43,962
MATT: Through you, did 50 points. You're still
part of it. All right, that ends Pike's turn. Vex,

2616
03:13:43,962 --> 03:13:46,221
we're taking your turn because you weren't in the
initiative order.

2617
03:13:46,221 --> 03:13:51,480
LAURA: That's okay. I'm going to cast Hunter's
Mark on Vorugal.

2618
03:13:51,480 --> 03:14:01,626
MATT: Because dragons are your chosen enemy, I'm
giving you the plus two damage against it.

2619
03:14:01,626 --> 03:14:10,774
LAURA: Okay, so I'm hidden, technically, so I get
sneak attack on him, right?

2620
03:14:10,774 --> 03:14:12,648
MATT: Currently, you have not been noticed.

2621
03:14:12,648 --> 03:14:26,118
LAURA: Okay, so I'm going to hit him, or try to.
That is 34.

2622
03:14:26,118 --> 03:14:33,308
MATT: Yeah, that'll hit. Divine Intervention, man.
Finally worked. Can't use it for a week, by the

2623
03:14:33,308 --> 03:14:35,844
way, Pike, just so you're aware. Once it succeeds,
you can't use it for a week.

2624
03:14:35,844 --> 03:14:36,995
ASHLEY: That's fine.

2625
03:14:36,995 --> 03:14:39,875
(laughter)

2626
03:14:39,875 --> 03:14:45,021
ASHLEY: I doubt it's going to work again. That, I
think, has never worked.

2627
03:14:45,021 --> 03:14:49,182
MARISHA: You've gotten close. You've gotten really
close.

2628
03:14:49,182 --> 03:14:51,011
TRAVIS: Three years, never worked.

2629
03:14:51,011 --> 03:14:58,753
LAURA: 30 points of damage on the first hit, and
two of those are lightning.

2630
03:14:58,753 --> 03:15:02,132
MATT: Great.

2631
03:15:02,132 --> 03:15:09,233
TALIESIN: Is it gargantuan? Gargantuan. Trust
Travis on this one.

2632
03:15:09,233 --> 03:15:13,736
LAURA: 22 on the second, two of which are
lightning.

2633
03:15:13,736 --> 03:15:22,364
MATT: Okay. Nice. All right, that ends your turn.
You used your bonus action to Hunter's Mark.

2634
03:15:22,364 --> 03:15:27,695
LAURA: I did. I'm going to hang out there and duck
down, if I can, behind my little outcropping.

2635
03:15:27,695 --> 03:15:29,710
MATT: Okay. Keyleth, you're up.

2636
03:15:29,710 --> 03:15:38,579
MARISHA: Okay. Oh god. I'm going to pop out of the
mansion. I was expecting to do an Earthbind spell,

2637
03:15:38,579 --> 03:15:41,599
but that's not necessary. That's okay!

2638
03:15:41,599 --> 03:15:44,764
MATT: Pike, do you want to move at all, or do you
want to stay behind that rock?

2639
03:15:44,764 --> 03:15:46,810
ASHLEY: I'm going to stay behind.

2640
03:15:46,810 --> 03:15:52,852
MARISHA: I'm going to fuck this guy up while he's
down. I'm going to peek around the corner, going

2641
03:15:52,852 --> 03:16:01,823
towards you a bit, and seeing everyone there and
all this go down, I'm going to Fire Storm the fuck

2642
03:16:01,823 --> 03:16:03,120
out of this!

2643
03:16:03,120 --> 03:16:04,537
MATT: All righty.

2644
03:16:04,537 --> 03:16:07,972
TALIESIN: Death from above.

2645
03:16:07,972 --> 03:16:12,075
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Fire rains from above!

2646
03:16:12,075 --> 03:16:14,035
MATT: How are you organizing the Fire Storm?

2647
03:16:14,035 --> 03:16:18,160
MARISHA: I have ten of these? I'm shaking.

2648
03:16:18,160 --> 03:16:31,900
MATT: Fire Storm, you create ten ten-foot cubes.
You can maneuver it to hit both him and Yenk, if

2649
03:16:31,900 --> 03:16:32,807
you want to.

2650
03:16:32,807 --> 03:16:34,193
MARISHA: Yeah, that's what I want.

2651
03:16:34,193 --> 03:16:36,107
MATT: Make a dexterity saving throw.

2652
03:16:36,107 --> 03:16:39,799
LIAM: Get that epic loot drop.

2653
03:16:39,799 --> 03:16:41,533
MARISHA: I know. I want it.

2654
03:16:41,533 --> 03:16:48,971
MATT: That is a failure on Vorugal, with a ten,
and a seven on Yenk. They both fail, so roll

2655
03:16:48,971 --> 03:16:51,930
damage on that. 7d10 fire damage.

2656
03:16:51,930 --> 03:16:53,911
MARISHA: 7d10.

2657
03:16:53,911 --> 03:16:58,595
LAURA: Hey, Matt.

2658
03:16:58,595 --> 03:17:00,964
MATT: Yes?

2659
03:17:00,964 --> 03:17:05,175
ASHLEY: 1d8 plus your spellcasting modifier?

2660
03:17:05,175 --> 03:17:07,384
MATT: Which is five. It's your wisdom.

2661
03:17:07,384 --> 03:17:09,333
ASHLEY: Spell attack bonus.

2662
03:17:09,333 --> 03:17:11,647
MATT: Yes, there's a difference.

2663
03:17:11,647 --> 03:17:12,968
ASHLEY: I understand.

2664
03:17:12,968 --> 03:17:17,012
LAURA: Do it, Keyleth!

2665
03:17:17,012 --> 03:17:22,129
TALIESIN: Want a bonus?

2666
03:17:22,129 --> 03:17:25,591
LAURA: It doesn't count on the floor.

2667
03:17:25,591 --> 03:17:48,705
MARISHA: I'll roll this one. It's eight! Okay,
hang on. (counting) 30. I picked it up. 38.

2668
03:17:48,705 --> 03:18:01,159
MATT: 38 fire damage to both of them. All righty.
The Fire Storm tears through the ravine. You can

2669
03:18:01,159 --> 03:18:06,066
see the flames burn over Vorugal's body. Vorugal
is now trying to get back up. (roars) He's

2670
03:18:06,066 --> 03:18:12,131
extremely angry. The flames curl over Yenk, who
bats away at them. It burns him, but Yenk does seem to

2671
03:18:12,131 --> 03:18:14,704
resist it fairly well.

2672
03:18:14,704 --> 03:18:18,545
MARISHA: I'm going to use the last bit of my
movement to pop back behind the stone.

2673
03:18:18,545 --> 03:18:25,549
MATT: Okay. There you go. All righty, does that
end your turn? Percy, you're up.

2674
03:18:25,549 --> 03:18:31,918
TALIESIN: I'm going to take aim and hold my full
attack until he tries to get up.

2675
03:18:31,918 --> 03:18:50,340
MATT: Okay. That brings us to Kima's turn. Kima
sees the opportunity. Because of the snow, she

2676
03:18:50,340 --> 03:19:06,698
can't quite get there yet with her full movement,
unfortunately. All righty. Kima is going to use

2677
03:19:06,698 --> 03:19:10,884
the rest of her action to dash and get right up
next to Vorugal and is going to use her bonus

2678
03:19:10,884 --> 03:19:21,015
action to use Vow of Enmity against it. She goes,
"You are going to see Bahamut in pieces!" As she

2679
03:19:21,015 --> 03:19:27,318
brings the thumb across, the holy symbol glows for
a second. You see a mark emblazon and burn itself

2680
03:19:27,318 --> 03:19:31,822
into the side of Vorugal's body. That's going to
end Kima's turn.

2681
03:19:31,822 --> 03:19:34,715
TALIESIN: That's a sick tattoo, y'all.

2682
03:19:34,715 --> 03:19:38,748
LAURA: Maybe it's like Hex and Hunter's Mark.

2683
03:19:38,748 --> 03:19:42,183
TRAVIS: We don't know what that does.

2684
03:19:42,183 --> 03:20:06,852
MATT: What's the range on that, actually? That's
going to be a rough call. Okay, you watch as

2685
03:20:06,852 --> 03:20:17,688
emerging from the treeline here, you see a little
dwarf step forward, unaffected by the ice, and

2686
03:20:17,688 --> 03:20:23,885
reach out a hand as a cluster of necrotic energy
sparkles in the center. Leaps forward toward

2687
03:20:23,885 --> 03:20:34,546
Vorugal. That is a success on the save, so it's
half damage, but Keyleth, you recognize at a

2688
03:20:34,546 --> 03:20:37,665
glance of your eye, this necromantic leap. This is
a Blight spell.

2689
03:20:37,665 --> 03:20:39,395
SAM: Blight spell?

2690
03:20:39,395 --> 03:20:41,451
LAURA: Who's doing a Blight spell?

2691
03:20:41,451 --> 03:20:42,944
SAM and MATT: Larkin.

2692
03:20:42,944 --> 03:20:45,505
SAM: He's secretly Raishan!

2693
03:20:45,505 --> 03:20:54,912
LIAM: What? Where did that dwarf come from? Did
you hire more mercenaries? When are they showing

2694
03:20:54,912 --> 03:21:01,724
up? Hey, I'll own it. It's fine. It's been a long
week.

2695
03:21:01,724 --> 03:21:08,288
MATT: Yenk turns around with a grin. (impacts)
Coming forward.

2696
03:21:08,288 --> 03:21:10,084
SAM: Yes, Yenk.

2697
03:21:10,084 --> 03:21:23,503
MATT: Is going to make three attacks, and has
advantage on these attacks, because it's prone. A

2698
03:21:23,503 --> 03:21:33,088
five and a one. Are you serious? Misses the first
strike, with advantage. Hits with the second

2699
03:21:33,088 --> 03:21:45,202
attack. Hits with the third. Okay, so that's going
to be 48 points of damage from Yenk. Slams a fist

2700
03:21:45,202 --> 03:21:50,788
once and glides off the scales. Second one goes
and slams into the side of Vorugal's neck, and

2701
03:21:50,788 --> 03:21:55,543
then picks up the hoof and jams it into the side
of the skull, cracking into the side of Vorugal's

2702
03:21:55,543 --> 03:22:01,885
head. You can see some teeth break and get thrown
off and scatter into the ice and snow nearby. At

2703
03:22:01,885 --> 03:22:07,910
the end of Yenk's turn, Vorugal is going to go
ahead and use two actions to wing attack once

2704
03:22:07,910 --> 03:22:18,983
more, getting up. Let's see. Yenk's going to have
to make a strength save. Fails. Kima fails, as

2705
03:22:18,983 --> 03:22:25,402
well. They are both knocked prone and suffer
bludgeoning damage.

2706
03:22:25,402 --> 03:22:28,292
TRAVIS: Only if you're right on him? I'm only two
squares away, I think.

2707
03:22:28,292 --> 03:22:33,016
MATT: You are also within 15 feet, Grog,
technically, so I need you to make a strength

2708
03:22:33,016 --> 03:22:34,870
saving throw.

2709
03:22:34,870 --> 03:22:38,329
TRAVIS: 17?

2710
03:22:38,329 --> 03:22:46,362
MATT: 17 does not cut it. You take 15 points of
bludgeoning damage and you are knocked prone.

2711
03:22:46,362 --> 03:22:49,829
LIAM: All the trees are down.

2712
03:22:49,829 --> 03:22:59,937
MATT: It's rough. And Vorugal gets half its
speed.

2713
03:22:59,937 --> 03:23:06,837
TALIESIN: Oh no. He's even starting to move? I'm
laying into him. Spending a grit point and I'm

2714
03:23:06,837 --> 03:23:09,678
knocking him in the foot, back prone before he can
even stand up.

2715
03:23:09,678 --> 03:23:11,851
MATT: Okay. How many grit points do you have, by
the way, now?

2716
03:23:11,851 --> 03:23:15,228
TALIESIN: This is my third or fourth because I did
crit, so I got one back.

2717
03:23:15,228 --> 03:23:19,927
MATT: You did. This is correct.

2718
03:23:19,927 --> 03:23:24,610
TALIESIN: 22.

2719
03:23:24,610 --> 03:23:26,418
MATT: 22 hits.

2720
03:23:26,418 --> 03:23:38,655
TALIESIN: That's a d10 and a d6, and another d6.
12 points of damage, plus one necrotic and two

2721
03:23:38,655 --> 03:23:43,854
psychic, so 15 points of damage, and he has a save
against 19.

2722
03:23:43,854 --> 03:23:47,835
MATT: That's a natural 20. Has disadvantage
because of your--

2723
03:23:47,835 --> 03:23:57,051
TALIESIN: No, I was about to say, it's a save, not
a check.

2724
03:23:57,051 --> 03:24:01,920
MATT: Oh, right. Strength checks. So natural 20.
Unaffected.

2725
03:24:01,920 --> 03:24:03,951
TALIESIN: Unaffected? Again!

2726
03:24:03,951 --> 03:24:05,746
MATT: This is your last grit point.

2727
03:24:05,746 --> 03:24:07,372
MARISHA: Can't say we're not honest.

2728
03:24:07,372 --> 03:24:16,880
TALIESIN: Blowing it. It's worth it. Gun jams.

2729
03:24:16,880 --> 03:24:18,883
MATT: Gun jams.

2730
03:24:18,883 --> 03:24:20,549
TALIESIN: You know what happens.

2731
03:24:20,549 --> 03:24:27,681
MATT: So as you go to fire Animus, it charges up
for a second and blasts back, and you watch as a

2732
03:24:27,681 --> 03:24:32,618
bolt of necrotic energy shoots up Percy's arm and
into his head and bursts at his temples. You take

2733
03:24:32,618 --> 03:24:34,775
2d6 points of psychic damage.

2734
03:24:34,775 --> 03:24:37,200
ASHLEY: Does the spiritual weapon get an attack of
opportunity?

2735
03:24:37,200 --> 03:24:39,407
MATT: No, it doesn't get attacks of opportunity.
It's not a creature.

2736
03:24:39,407 --> 03:24:51,171
TALIESIN: Ow. That's the end of my turn. I'm going
to dive down and hide and hold.

2737
03:24:51,171 --> 03:25:01,547
MATT: That ends Yenk's turn. It's now Vorugal's
turn. Gets the breath back. Turns around here.

2738
03:25:01,547 --> 03:25:06,158
At the giant cluster of shit here.

2739
03:25:06,158 --> 03:25:09,020
SAM: He does not see me!

2740
03:25:09,020 --> 03:25:17,023
MATT: Doesn't need to. You're in a very big space
there. I need Pike, Scanlan, and Keyleth to all

2741
03:25:17,023 --> 03:25:19,059
make constitution saving throws.

2742
03:25:19,059 --> 03:25:22,477
MARISHA: The cloak doesn't have anything to do
with this, right?

2743
03:25:22,477 --> 03:25:26,179
SAM: Can I use Cutting Words to reduce the
attack?

2744
03:25:26,179 --> 03:25:28,437
MATT: It's not an attack. It's an effect that
happens.

2745
03:25:28,437 --> 03:25:32,773
MARISHA: With advantage? Natural 20!

2746
03:25:32,773 --> 03:25:35,639
MATT: With advantage? Why do you get advantage?

2747
03:25:35,639 --> 03:25:37,313
MARISHA: I thought you said advantage.

2748
03:25:37,313 --> 03:25:38,508
MATT: No.

2749
03:25:38,508 --> 03:25:41,491
MARISHA: Fucking fuck! Well, then I guess I
reroll.

2750
03:25:41,491 --> 03:25:44,534
LIAM: Rolled two dice.

2751
03:25:44,534 --> 03:25:46,860
MATT: Roll one dice.

2752
03:25:46,860 --> 03:25:55,088
MARISHA: I should have kept the first one. That's
an 18, which is good! 23.

2753
03:25:55,088 --> 03:25:57,507
MATT: Okay. Scanlan?

2754
03:25:57,507 --> 03:26:00,749
SAM: 13. I add nothing to it, right?

2755
03:26:00,749 --> 03:26:05,069
TALIESIN: Is it constitution saving? Plus two.

2756
03:26:05,069 --> 03:26:09,970
MATT: 23. Pike, what did you get?

2757
03:26:09,970 --> 03:26:11,125
ASHLEY: Nine.

2758
03:26:11,125 --> 03:26:18,553
MATT: Nine. Kima failed. So that is 72 points of
cold damage to Scanlan, Pike, and Kima.

2759
03:26:18,553 --> 03:26:21,303
ASHLEY: Divided between us all, right?

2760
03:26:21,303 --> 03:26:24,076
(laughter)

2761
03:26:24,076 --> 03:26:28,914
MATT: No, sorry. Halved to you.

2762
03:26:28,914 --> 03:26:31,628
MARISHA: That's 36?

2763
03:26:31,628 --> 03:26:33,968
ASHLEY: Just 72?

2764
03:26:33,968 --> 03:26:37,696
MATT: Wait, does one of you have the Cold Snap
armor on?

2765
03:26:37,696 --> 03:26:38,958
LAURA: I do.

2766
03:26:38,958 --> 03:26:50,410
MATT: Oh yeah. So yeah, 36 cold damage to you,
Keyleth. 72 to both of you and Kima. And Vorugal

2767
03:26:50,410 --> 03:26:57,952
is then going to get back a bit and fly a little
higher.

2768
03:26:57,952 --> 03:27:01,878
TALIESIN: He moved really far in one turn.

2769
03:27:01,878 --> 03:27:07,593
MATT: The wing effect is a legendary action on
somebody else's turn, and then on his turn, he has

2770
03:27:07,593 --> 03:27:09,535
a speed of 80 feet, flying.

2771
03:27:09,535 --> 03:27:11,083
TALIESIN: Even halved?

2772
03:27:11,083 --> 03:27:14,834
MATT: He's not affected by cold. Sorry, white
dragon.

2773
03:27:14,834 --> 03:27:19,767
TALIESIN: We're still going to need you, then,
apparently.

2774
03:27:19,767 --> 03:27:22,907
MATT: That's going to end Vorugal's turn. Grog,
you're up.

2775
03:27:22,907 --> 03:27:34,836
TRAVIS: Oh, well, he's in the air, which is my
preference, all around. Can I get up, please? Now

2776
03:27:34,836 --> 03:27:39,393
we're somewhere. Can I move directly under him as
far as I can go?

2777
03:27:39,393 --> 03:27:44,760
MATT: That's half movement, so that's about as far
as you can get right now.

2778
03:27:44,760 --> 03:27:47,571
TRAVIS: Can I haste or pick my nose to go any
further?

2779
03:27:47,571 --> 03:27:49,221
MATT: Unfortunately, no.

2780
03:27:49,221 --> 03:27:51,270
LIAM: Hold for him to drop?

2781
03:27:51,270 --> 03:27:54,886
TRAVIS: I will hold until he drops.

2782
03:27:54,886 --> 03:27:57,486
LIAM: Oh, sad Grog.

2783
03:27:57,486 --> 03:28:02,407
MATT: Scanlan, you're up.

2784
03:28:02,407 --> 03:28:09,551
SAM: Jesus. I will continue my movement clockwise
around the board.

2785
03:28:09,551 --> 03:28:13,813
MATT: This way, you mean? That's your movement.

2786
03:28:13,813 --> 03:28:21,130
SAM: How far is he from me? A long way.

2787
03:28:21,130 --> 03:28:23,213
MATT: Quite a ways right now, yeah.

2788
03:28:23,213 --> 03:28:27,219
SAM: 150 to 200 feet?

2789
03:28:27,219 --> 03:28:34,199
MATT: Not quite that much, no. Maybe somewhere in
the neighborhood of 80 feet.

2790
03:28:34,199 --> 03:28:38,355
SAM: Has my invisibility dropped when I got
blasted?

2791
03:28:38,355 --> 03:28:45,034
MATT: Actually, make a concentration check with
advantage, because you have War Caster.

2792
03:28:45,034 --> 03:28:47,972
SAM: Concentration? Is it plus anything?

2793
03:28:47,972 --> 03:28:50,203
MATT: It's a constitution saving throw.

2794
03:28:50,203 --> 03:28:51,302
SAM: 14.

2795
03:28:51,302 --> 03:28:58,962
MATT: 14. Yeah, no. You had to beat a 36 because
of the damage from the ice blast. Yeah, your

2796
03:28:58,962 --> 03:29:01,488
invisibility drops. You are now fully visible.

2797
03:29:01,488 --> 03:29:07,425
SAM: Okay. Is he within 120 feet of me?

2798
03:29:07,425 --> 03:29:10,187
MATT: Yeah, he's within 120 feet, probably.

2799
03:29:10,187 --> 03:29:13,442
SAM: All right, I'll punch him in the face.

2800
03:29:13,442 --> 03:29:16,845
MATT: Bigby's Hand?

2801
03:29:16,845 --> 03:29:18,839
SAM: Yeah. I will Bigby's Hand him.

2802
03:29:18,839 --> 03:29:24,231
MATT: All right. Bigby's Hand flies up to meet
Vorugal.

2803
03:29:24,231 --> 03:29:29,263
LIAM: Can you yank his shit down?

2804
03:29:29,263 --> 03:29:33,271
SAM: He's way too big. I can try to grab a wing.

2805
03:29:33,271 --> 03:29:37,231
MARISHA: Can you grapple him? Grapple a wing?

2806
03:29:37,231 --> 03:29:44,455
SAM: DM, how does this work? I cannot grapple
anything above a huge monster. Can I grapple part

2807
03:29:44,455 --> 03:29:45,761
of a gargantuan monster?

2808
03:29:45,761 --> 03:29:48,320
MATT: Unfortunately, he's just too big for Bigby's
Hand.

2809
03:29:48,320 --> 03:29:55,225
SAM: So I just punch him. Simply a punch. Bigby's
Hand!

2810
03:29:55,225 --> 03:30:00,559
MATT: Roll a d20 plus your spell attack bonus.

2811
03:30:00,559 --> 03:30:04,188
SAM: 17.

2812
03:30:04,188 --> 03:30:09,902
MATT: 17. (whoosh) The fist swings past. Vorugal
dodges out of the way, batting his wings and

2813
03:30:09,902 --> 03:30:13,375
getting out of the trajectory of the fist that
just streaks by harmlessly.

2814
03:30:13,375 --> 03:30:22,619
SAM: Great. I think I'm within range of Lady
Kima? I can inspire her, maybe?

2815
03:30:22,619 --> 03:30:24,476
MATT: Yeah.

2816
03:30:24,476 --> 03:30:26,400
SAM: You know what? Fuck her. I'm going to heal
myself.

2817
03:30:26,400 --> 03:30:28,145
(laughter)

2818
03:30:28,145 --> 03:30:29,941
SAM: She crossed me one too many times.

2819
03:30:29,941 --> 03:30:33,226
MARISHA: She crossed <i>you</i>?

2820
03:30:33,226 --> 03:30:35,678
SAM: Fuck her.

2821
03:30:35,678 --> 03:30:39,915
LAURA: Poor Kima. Trying to get mind-wiped so many
times by him.

2822
03:30:39,915 --> 03:30:44,775
MARISHA: He's a dick to her, and now he's angry
about it.

2823
03:30:44,775 --> 03:30:53,794
SAM: Healing Word. Can I do level two? That's 2d4
plus six now?

2824
03:30:53,794 --> 03:30:55,648
MATT: Yeah.

2825
03:30:55,648 --> 03:31:02,247
SAM: 12 points. Great. Okay. Thanks.

2826
03:31:02,247 --> 03:31:05,521
MATT: All righty. That's your turn, Scanlan?

2827
03:31:05,521 --> 03:31:06,347
SAM: Yes.

2828
03:31:06,347 --> 03:31:07,550
MATT: Vax, you're up.

2829
03:31:07,550 --> 03:31:15,075
LIAM: Oh jeez! Really? Okay. So I'm right there.
Am I within 60 feet?

2830
03:31:15,075 --> 03:31:16,827
MATT: Maybe.

2831
03:31:16,827 --> 03:31:23,927
LIAM: I'm going to fly 20 feet forward through the
storm toward him.

2832
03:31:23,927 --> 03:31:33,312
MATT: Okay. That will put you right about there.

2833
03:31:33,312 --> 03:31:35,959
LIAM: Yeah. Dagger, dagger, dagger.

2834
03:31:35,959 --> 03:31:42,561
LAURA: Oh, you have three daggers still?

2835
03:31:42,561 --> 03:31:54,537
LIAM: They come back, man. First is 26. Second is
a 17, but I'm going to use my second Luck, so the

2836
03:31:54,537 --> 03:31:58,196
second is a 21. And the third is 19.

2837
03:31:58,196 --> 03:32:02,715
MATT: All right. The 17 and 19 miss.

2838
03:32:02,715 --> 03:32:05,692
LIAM: Okay, so the first one was really high. The
second two are mediocre.

2839
03:32:05,692 --> 03:32:08,581
MATT: The first one hits. The other two streak
off.

2840
03:32:08,581 --> 03:32:09,906
LIAM: Whisper hits.

2841
03:32:09,906 --> 03:32:11,062
MATT: Yes.

2842
03:32:11,062 --> 03:32:19,209
SAM: Does he get sneak attack because I'm on the
flank with my hand?

2843
03:32:19,209 --> 03:32:26,218
LIAM: No, I didn't think so. That is terrible.
That's just ten. And I use my movement to fly

2844
03:32:26,218 --> 03:32:28,454
directly under him.

2845
03:32:28,454 --> 03:32:29,951
MATT: Okay. You're not going with Whisper?

2846
03:32:29,951 --> 03:32:31,212
LIAM: Say again?

2847
03:32:31,212 --> 03:32:32,399
MATT: You're not going with Whisper?

2848
03:32:32,399 --> 03:32:33,344
LIAM: No.

2849
03:32:33,344 --> 03:32:34,399
MATT: Okay.

2850
03:32:34,399 --> 03:32:46,677
LIAM: No... Yes, I am.

2851
03:32:46,677 --> 03:32:49,298
MATT: Are you?

2852
03:32:49,298 --> 03:32:51,897
LIAM: Could I have hit him in the tail?

2853
03:32:51,897 --> 03:33:05,461
MATT: If you want to, sure. Why not? You
impact.

2854
03:33:05,461 --> 03:33:07,172
LIAM: I got the blade on his tail, and I'm there.

2855
03:33:07,172 --> 03:33:09,423
MATT: Okay. You're right there with Vorugal.

2856
03:33:09,423 --> 03:33:11,092
MARISHA: It's becoming a Jenga mini-game.

2857
03:33:11,182 --> 03:33:13,644
LIAM: That's where I am.

2858
03:33:13,644 --> 03:33:17,536
MATT: All righty. That ends Vax's turn. Vex,
you're up.

2859
03:33:17,536 --> 03:33:21,444
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to try to hit him a couple
times.

2860
03:33:21,444 --> 03:33:23,073
MATT: Go for it.

2861
03:33:23,073 --> 03:33:33,230
LAURA: My moves are really intricate. 25 for the
first one, and I'm using Blazing Bowstring on

2862
03:33:33,230 --> 03:34:03,778
this. Okay. (counting) Oh! Okay. I have 40 points
of damage on the first hit, two of which are

2863
03:34:03,778 --> 03:34:06,326
lightning, seven of which are fire damage.

2864
03:34:06,326 --> 03:34:07,974
MATT: 40.

2865
03:34:07,974 --> 03:34:11,579
LAURA: And I get sneak attack because Vax is on
him.

2866
03:34:11,579 --> 03:34:12,911
MATT: Yep.

2867
03:34:12,911 --> 03:34:16,064
SAM: Is that Fenthras?

2868
03:34:16,064 --> 03:34:19,641
LAURA: It's Fenthras. And then 25 on the second
hit.

2869
03:34:19,641 --> 03:34:21,764
SAM: Points of damage?!

2870
03:34:21,764 --> 03:34:47,644
LAURA: No, that's just to attack. Oh, jeez Louise.
(counting) 23 on the second one, with four points

2871
03:34:47,644 --> 03:34:52,305
of lightning damage and two points of fire
damage.

2872
03:34:52,305 --> 03:34:54,177
MATT: All right. So that's your turn?

2873
03:34:54,177 --> 03:34:57,018
LAURA: And I'm going to use my bonus action to
hide.

2874
03:34:57,018 --> 03:34:58,821
MATT: Okay. Roll a stealth check.

2875
03:34:58,821 --> 03:35:04,676
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace still on me?

2876
03:35:04,676 --> 03:35:06,395
MATT: No, because you used Hunter's Mark.

2877
03:35:06,395 --> 03:35:09,122
LAURA: Right. So that is 27.

2878
03:35:09,122 --> 03:35:12,192
MATT: Okay, good to know. End of your turn,
Vorugal is going to use his legendary action to

2879
03:35:12,192 --> 03:35:13,810
make a tail attack against Vax.

2880
03:35:13,810 --> 03:35:16,552
LIAM: Is that melee? Can I use Uncanny Dodge?

2881
03:35:16,552 --> 03:35:21,103
MATT: You can if it hits you, yeah. So that is a
26?

2882
03:35:21,103 --> 03:35:25,288
LIAM: Shite! Yeah, Uncanny Dodge.

2883
03:35:25,288 --> 03:35:31,419
MATT: Okay. So as you get up there and the arrows
smack into the sides, from both Vex's attacks--

2884
03:35:31,419 --> 03:35:36,347
LIAM: Wait! I want to use my last Luck to make him
roll again. Which I can do.

2885
03:35:36,347 --> 03:35:41,250
MATT: Okay, you can. That is 27.

2886
03:35:41,250 --> 03:35:50,372
LIAM: Wow. It's all right. Uncanny Dodge!

2887
03:35:50,372 --> 03:35:55,876
TALIESIN: No, what are you going to do? Ancient
white dragon. Someone's going to get knocked

2888
03:35:55,876 --> 03:35:56,962
unconscious.

2889
03:35:56,962 --> 03:36:02,682
MATT: 23 points of bludgeoning damage as the tail
(whack) slams you in the side, almost breaking one

2890
03:36:02,682 --> 03:36:07,997
of the wings off, and you just manage to catch
yourself in the air. So 28, and you can half that.

2891
03:36:07,997 --> 03:36:14,597
All right. So that ends Vex's turn. Pike, you're
up.

2892
03:36:14,597 --> 03:36:16,439
ASHLEY: All right.

2893
03:36:16,439 --> 03:36:19,965
SAM: Do that Divine Intervention thing again. That
was really good.

2894
03:36:19,965 --> 03:36:37,300
ASHLEY: It's been a week, right? One week is one round,
right? Okay. So what I'd like to do... Here's a

2895
03:36:37,300 --> 03:36:51,413
question. Flame Strike, since it comes from the
sky, would it work since he's up in the sky? Comes

2896
03:36:51,413 --> 03:36:55,088
from above.

2897
03:36:55,088 --> 03:37:06,355
MATT: Ten-foot radius, 40-foot high cylinder.
Centered around a point within range. So it's a

2898
03:37:06,355 --> 03:37:16,104
60-foot range. Doesn't say it has to be on the
ground, per se.

2899
03:37:16,104 --> 03:37:21,012
ASHLEY: All right, let's give it a try.

2900
03:37:21,012 --> 03:37:25,648
LAURA: Do it towards the front of Vorugal, so it
doesn't hit Vax.

2901
03:37:25,648 --> 03:37:31,093
LIAM and LAURA: Hit him in the face.

2902
03:37:31,093 --> 03:37:38,877
MATT: Ten-foot radius. Yeah. You can direct it
where it's not going to hit Vax.

2903
03:37:38,877 --> 03:37:40,561
LIAM: Thanks, Matt.

2904
03:37:40,561 --> 03:37:42,670
MATT: (laughs) All right, so what's your spell
DC?

2905
03:37:42,670 --> 03:37:45,233
ASHLEY: 18.

2906
03:37:45,233 --> 03:37:50,722
MATT: 18. This is dex, right? It's a 21. He
succeeds, so that's half damage. Go ahead and roll

2907
03:37:50,722 --> 03:37:53,775
damage on that. It's 8d6 damage.

2908
03:37:53,775 --> 03:37:57,709
LAURA: Oh, do you even have to roll the attack on
that?

2909
03:37:57,709 --> 03:38:02,136
MATT: It explodes, and it's a saving throw to
see if he manages to avoid some of the damage,

2910
03:38:02,136 --> 03:38:08,343
which he did. What did you get?

2911
03:38:08,343 --> 03:38:10,418
SAM: It's ten-foot radius? Ten-foot diameter?

2912
03:38:10,418 --> 03:38:11,651
MATT: Ten-foot radius.

2913
03:38:11,651 --> 03:38:13,181
SAM: It doesn't hit the Hand, does it?

2914
03:38:13,181 --> 03:38:17,776
MATT: No. She's directing it in a way where it hits the
front of him. It bursts right through his head and

2915
03:38:17,776 --> 03:38:22,332
the edge of his wings.

2916
03:38:22,332 --> 03:38:24,976
ASHLEY: 19.

2917
03:38:24,976 --> 03:38:26,972
TRAVIS: And two more. That's 8d6.

2918
03:38:26,972 --> 03:38:27,763
LAURA: It's 8d6?

2919
03:38:27,763 --> 03:38:29,282
MATT: 8d6, yeah.

2920
03:38:29,282 --> 03:38:36,277
ASHLEY: Oh! (giggles) Do I add anything else?

2921
03:38:36,277 --> 03:38:38,742
MATT: Just those.

2922
03:38:38,742 --> 03:38:42,593
ASHLEY: What is it? 29.

2923
03:38:42,593 --> 03:38:49,015
MATT: 29. All right. So 14 points of damage with
the halved. (explosion) The blast hits; the flames

2924
03:38:49,015 --> 03:38:55,309
spin around. You see Vorugal starting to look a
bit rough now. It's getting angry; wings are

2925
03:38:55,309 --> 03:39:01,452
beating faster. You can see there's a feral
desperation in Vorugal's eyes right now at all the

2926
03:39:01,452 --> 03:39:03,474
things that are starting to come at him.

2927
03:39:03,474 --> 03:39:09,396
ASHLEY: I'm going to stay put. And for bonus
action, I'm going to cast Healing Word on myself.

2928
03:39:09,396 --> 03:39:24,587
MATT: Okay. All right. At the end of your turn,
Pike, using another legendary action to

2929
03:39:24,587 --> 03:39:31,194
make another tail attack at Vax, trying to beat
you away from behind at this point. That is a 25.

2930
03:39:31,194 --> 03:39:33,959
LIAM: That hits.

2931
03:39:33,959 --> 03:39:35,348
MATT: That hits? Okay.

2932
03:39:35,348 --> 03:39:37,292
LIAM: And I'm out of Uncanny Dodge, right?

2933
03:39:37,292 --> 03:39:46,720
MATT: Well, you can only make one reaction per
round, yeah. That'll put you at 14 points

2934
03:39:46,720 --> 03:39:51,790
of bludgeoning damage. (whack) Right at your side
this time. Though you were able to dodge most of the first

2935
03:39:51,790 --> 03:39:56,338
impact, this one smacks you to your side, and you
spiral over for a second, catching yourself, and

2936
03:39:56,338 --> 03:40:03,711
still keep afloat right there. All right, that
brings us to Keyleth.

2937
03:40:03,711 --> 03:40:07,215
MARISHA: Okay. I am going to cast Earthbind on
him.

2938
03:40:07,215 --> 03:40:09,731
MATT: Earthbind. What's the range on Earthbind?

2939
03:40:09,731 --> 03:40:12,407
MARISHA: 300 feet.

2940
03:40:12,407 --> 03:40:19,131
MATT: Yeah, that will do it. All right, what's the
saving throw on it? Saving throw on that is a

2941
03:40:19,131 --> 03:40:30,181
strength saving throw. All right, that is a
failure. It's going to use one of its legendary

2942
03:40:30,181 --> 03:40:32,068
resistances to make it.

2943
03:40:32,068 --> 03:40:33,218
(groaning)

2944
03:40:33,218 --> 03:40:37,956
TALIESIN: Good, you've burned it. Had to burn it.

2945
03:40:37,956 --> 03:40:45,191
MARISHA: (frustrated noise)

2946
03:40:45,191 --> 03:40:47,079
TRAVIS: She's speaking Parseltongue.

2947
03:40:47,079 --> 03:40:50,414
(laughter)

2948
03:40:50,414 --> 03:40:57,585
MARISHA: I am going to do a bonus action to cast
Healing Word on myself. Heal myself real quick.

2949
03:40:57,585 --> 03:41:07,360
Same thing, I want to scoot back a little bit,
behind that tree, a bit.

2950
03:41:07,360 --> 03:41:09,061
MATT: Right behind here?

2951
03:41:09,061 --> 03:41:11,299
MARISHA: Yeah, because I got whacked with that ice
breath, and I don't want that to

2952
03:41:11,299 --> 03:41:12,932
happen again. All right.

2953
03:41:12,932 --> 03:41:23,513
MATT: All right. That ends your turn? At the end
of your turn, he's going to use his third and

2954
03:41:23,513 --> 03:41:31,119
final legendary action to make another tail swipe at
Vax. That is a 27.

2955
03:41:31,119 --> 03:41:34,226
LIAM: You've hit me right now? Yeah, that hits.

2956
03:41:34,226 --> 03:41:42,024
MATT: Okay. This third tail strike right now is
going to do 17 points of bludgeoning damage.

2957
03:41:42,024 --> 03:41:50,494
(impacts) You've been battered in the air by the
white dragon tail swinging behind. The focus is

2958
03:41:50,494 --> 03:41:54,946
less on you as it's hitting you, and it's
focusing on the whole battlefield down in front of

2959
03:41:54,946 --> 03:41:57,177
it and the giant demon that is still lying on the
ground.

2960
03:41:57,177 --> 03:41:59,085
LIAM: Thanks, Heroes' Feast.

2961
03:41:59,085 --> 03:42:05,244
MATT: That brings us up to Percy.

2962
03:42:05,244 --> 03:42:25,936
TALIESIN: I am going to heal, as my bonus action.
That's not bad. That's 19 points. I'm a little

2963
03:42:25,936 --> 03:42:34,126
better now. I'm at 108; I'm fine. Now, I'm going
to take out Bad News. Fuck Animus for now. Take

2964
03:42:34,126 --> 03:42:39,499
out Bad News and take two shots at this bastard
with sharpshooter.

2965
03:42:39,499 --> 03:42:42,684
LAURA: What's Yenk doing down there? Sleeping?

2966
03:42:42,684 --> 03:42:45,471
MATT: Yenk got knocked prone.

2967
03:42:45,471 --> 03:42:47,142
TALIESIN: For fuck's sake!

2968
03:42:47,142 --> 03:42:49,206
SAM: Gun jam?

2969
03:42:49,206 --> 03:42:50,770
TALIESIN: Yeah, gun jammed.

2970
03:42:50,770 --> 03:42:57,699
MATT: Fire again, this time (click, explosion).
You see a burst of smoke come out, and part of the

2971
03:42:57,699 --> 03:43:00,178
metal slightly bends. And you're like, "Shit!"

2972
03:43:00,178 --> 03:43:01,829
SAM: All your guns?

2973
03:43:01,829 --> 03:43:07,261
TALIESIN: No, I have one more gun. But I don't
have time. That burns an action.

2974
03:43:07,261 --> 03:43:12,714
MATT: Yeah. You could use your action surge, if
you wanted to.

2975
03:43:12,714 --> 03:43:16,807
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm using my action surge. Might
as well.

2976
03:43:16,807 --> 03:43:19,735
MARISHA: You try to unjam it?

2977
03:43:19,735 --> 03:43:25,877
TALIESIN: No, I'm taking out my last pistol and
I'm shooting. I'm just going to shoot. See if I

2978
03:43:25,877 --> 03:43:29,008
can take two more shots. Technically not; it's two
shots.

2979
03:43:29,008 --> 03:43:31,638
MATT: No, if you're pulling your next gun out.
You're not trying to repair?

2980
03:43:31,638 --> 03:43:33,284
TALIESIN: No, I'm not trying to repair.

2981
03:43:33,284 --> 03:43:38,760
MATT: You'd still have two more attacks. Yeah,
because you have quick draw. You drop Bad News,

2982
03:43:38,760 --> 03:43:40,455
grab another weapon. You still have two more
attacks.

2983
03:43:40,455 --> 03:43:42,640
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm taking two more shots, then.
Sharpshooter shot with Retort.

2984
03:43:42,640 --> 03:43:55,817
No, it's different. 16.

2985
03:43:55,817 --> 03:44:00,887
MATT: Nope. Fires off in the distant cloud.

2986
03:44:00,887 --> 03:44:05,427
LAURA: It's that new damn gun. Its sight is all
shit.

2987
03:44:05,427 --> 03:44:12,181
TALIESIN: Ah! That one hits, on the other hand, I
think. 22?

2988
03:44:12,181 --> 03:44:13,864
MATT: That hits.

2989
03:44:13,864 --> 03:44:27,239
TALIESIN: That's not much, but I'll take it. Nine
points of normal damage plus two necrotic, so

2990
03:44:27,239 --> 03:44:30,814
that's 11 points of damage. No, 21 points of
damage. I'm so sorry.

2991
03:44:30,814 --> 03:44:37,348
MATT: Right, with the ten. Yeah. There you go. 21.
First one misses. (click) You set it up. This

2992
03:44:37,348 --> 03:44:43,200
time, takes a shot. (impact) It hits Vorugal from
underneath a few feet off from where Vax is. You

2993
03:44:43,200 --> 03:44:47,249
can see the wound beginning to bleed now. The more
damage Vorugal gets, the more you can see the

2994
03:44:47,249 --> 03:44:52,082
trickle of reddish-blue blood darkening against
the white skin. Vorugal is looking fairly

2995
03:44:52,082 --> 03:44:53,448
damaged.

2996
03:44:53,448 --> 03:45:00,998
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn my action surge and
take three more shots. Fuck it. See if I can lose

2997
03:45:00,998 --> 03:45:10,142
the third gun. It's that night, apparently. No, I
will not. That's 18?

2998
03:45:10,142 --> 03:45:11,529
MATT: Nope.

2999
03:45:11,529 --> 03:45:16,999
TALIESIN: Fuck the sharpshooter shot. I'm just
going for it. No sharpshooter. Thank god!

3000
03:45:16,999 --> 03:45:21,689
That's 20?

3001
03:45:21,689 --> 03:45:23,090
MATT: 20 just hits.

3002
03:45:23,090 --> 03:45:32,891
TALIESIN: Excellent. Good to know. Oh my god,
that's bullshit. Ten points, three necrotic, so it's

3003
03:45:32,891 --> 03:45:36,231
ten points of damage.

3004
03:45:36,231 --> 03:45:37,461
MATT: Your final shot?

3005
03:45:37,461 --> 03:45:48,747
TALIESIN: My final shot. No, it didn't. This one
doesn't do that. That's nice, but I miss. That's

3006
03:45:48,747 --> 03:45:50,522
16. That misses.

3007
03:45:50,522 --> 03:45:51,760
MATT: Yeah.

3008
03:45:51,760 --> 03:45:55,647
TALIESIN: Thankfully, it doesn't burn that gun.
No, that gun is better built.

3009
03:45:55,647 --> 03:45:58,186
I'm rolling really poorly.

3010
03:45:58,186 --> 03:46:03,796
MATT: That ends your turn. That comes to Kima's
turn. Kima is going to get up.

3011
03:46:03,796 --> 03:46:07,708
TRAVIS: Come on, represent us melee-ers!

3012
03:46:07,708 --> 03:46:10,954
LAURA: The three of you down on the ground.

3013
03:46:10,954 --> 03:46:14,068
MATT: I know. This is a rough fight for the
melee.

3014
03:46:14,068 --> 03:46:15,796
TRAVIS: I'm making a mean face, so far.

3015
03:46:15,796 --> 03:46:18,958
MARISHA: You're mad-dogging the dragon?

3016
03:46:18,958 --> 03:46:28,715
MATT: Did maintain concentration. That's
good. Kima's going to use a bonus action to heal

3017
03:46:28,715 --> 03:46:36,592
you, Grog, for nine points. Nine health, using her
Aura of Vitality.

3018
03:46:36,592 --> 03:46:38,790
SAM: Why wouldn't she heal me?

3019
03:46:38,790 --> 03:46:40,705
MATT: She's not close enough to you,
unfortunately.

3020
03:46:40,705 --> 03:46:42,475
SAM: And she hates me.

3021
03:46:42,475 --> 03:46:48,766
MATT: Yeah, you may have pissed her off. She will
move up into range with Yenk, but she can't

3022
03:46:48,766 --> 03:46:54,120
actually attack. Too much ice, and her legs are
not the longest, and she's having a hard time

3023
03:46:54,120 --> 03:46:56,406
getting in the fray, but now she's locked in the
battle.

3024
03:46:56,406 --> 03:47:05,179
SAM: Larkin's turn.

3025
03:47:05,179 --> 03:47:07,810
LAURA: Good old Larkin!

3026
03:47:07,810 --> 03:47:13,809
SAM: Good old Larkin! Come on, Larkin. Bring him
down!

3027
03:47:13,809 --> 03:47:16,407
MATT: All right.

3028
03:47:16,407 --> 03:47:20,906
MARISHA: Where is Yenk?

3029
03:47:20,906 --> 03:47:28,096
TALIESIN: Yenk ain't got nothing but us to hit right
now. Let's not dwell on that.

3030
03:47:28,170 --> 03:47:31,323
MATT: It's Larkin's turn, technically.

3031
03:47:31,323 --> 03:47:37,492
SAM: (singing) You see him Larkin. You hating.

3032
03:47:37,492 --> 03:47:41,194
(laughter)

3033
03:47:41,194 --> 03:47:48,201
MATT: You watch as the tiny dwarf form looks around
at the chaos here, and with how things are going,

3034
03:47:48,201 --> 03:47:51,413
"Shite!"

3035
03:47:51,413 --> 03:47:54,326
LAURA: Don't you fucking ditch! Don't you ditch
out!

3036
03:47:54,326 --> 03:47:57,617
MATT: His form vanishes as a green dragon
appears.

3037
03:47:57,617 --> 03:47:59,749
(shouting)

3038
03:47:59,749 --> 03:48:01,640
LIAM: Cards on the table!

3039
03:48:01,640 --> 03:48:05,253
MATT: All right, uses the movement to fly up.

3040
03:48:05,253 --> 03:48:10,063
MARISHA: Is she going to go for him?

3041
03:48:10,063 --> 03:48:14,913
LAURA: She's going! She's doing it. She's so teeny
compared to him!

3042
03:48:14,913 --> 03:48:26,975
MATT: She is a diseased dragon. And releases
(blows air) cold blast of poison breath at this

3043
03:48:26,975 --> 03:48:28,289
direction.

3044
03:48:28,289 --> 03:48:30,055
MARISHA: Heroes' Feast, man.

3045
03:48:30,055 --> 03:48:39,417
MATT: As the billowing cloud of toxic fumes fills
you, you instinctually freak out for a second

3046
03:48:39,417 --> 03:48:43,649
before you realize that the magical protection in
your lungs is preventing any of it from taking

3047
03:48:43,649 --> 03:48:52,475
hold inside. That's cocked. It does make its
save.

3048
03:48:52,475 --> 03:48:54,498
SAM: What kind of save is it?

3049
03:48:54,498 --> 03:48:55,980
MATT: It's a constitution.

3050
03:48:55,980 --> 03:49:03,290
SAM: Does the Hand need to make a save? Hand has
an AC of 20 and my hit points.

3051
03:49:03,290 --> 03:49:10,137
MATT: I don't know if the poison's going to affect
Bigby's Hand. It'is arcane. It's not going to

3052
03:49:10,137 --> 03:49:25,981
affect that. That's for more of physically hitting
it. However, Vorugal does end up taking 38 points

3053
03:49:25,981 --> 03:49:28,161
of poison damage.

3054
03:49:28,161 --> 03:49:32,583
SAM: And then Vax goes, "Wait a second, Larkin was
a dragon?!"

3055
03:49:32,583 --> 03:49:36,297
(laughter)

3056
03:49:36,297 --> 03:49:53,417
MATT: Okay, at this point, that's going to end
Raishan's turn. Yenk gets up, looking at the

3057
03:49:53,417 --> 03:50:04,767
battlefield. He sees this giant, hulking goliath.
Well, technically with Seeming, a large dragonborn

3058
03:50:04,767 --> 03:50:10,422
with an axe. Lurches forward. Kima gets an attack
of opportunity against Yenk.

3059
03:50:10,422 --> 03:50:16,528
LAURA: Would he still look like a little
dragonborn?

3060
03:50:16,528 --> 03:50:22,081
MATT: No, his physical form still shifts into a
larger one. He looks smaller than his actual self,

3061
03:50:22,081 --> 03:50:26,911
I guess, comparatively. We'll say for the fun
element of it, he still looks like a bigger

3062
03:50:26,911 --> 03:50:33,526
dragonborn, as Grog wants to look bigger on this
one. Kima does hit Yenk. She's going to use Divine

3063
03:50:33,526 --> 03:50:39,427
Smite, 4th-level spell against him as part of
that. Ooh! That's going to be nice.

3064
03:50:39,427 --> 03:50:46,775
TALIESIN: Remember to go into the stomach, if it
goes. We've got a relic in its stomach.

3065
03:50:46,775 --> 03:50:54,217
MARISHA: Don't eviscerate him. It's fine. It's not
going anywhere.

3066
03:50:54,217 --> 03:51:07,621
MATT: 21 plus 4d8. 5d8 because it is a fiend.

3067
03:51:07,621 --> 03:51:09,829
TRAVIS: Yeah! 5d8 because it is a fiend!

3068
03:51:09,829 --> 03:51:19,762
MATT: I don't want to rob her of any awesome
damage here.

3069
03:51:19,762 --> 03:51:23,564
TRAVIS: Yeah, come on. For the very few times Kima
gets to get shake the dust off.

3070
03:51:23,564 --> 03:51:24,984
MATT: I know. Seriously!

3071
03:51:24,984 --> 03:51:29,752
MARISHA: It does look like he's copping a feel.

3072
03:51:29,752 --> 03:51:32,725
SAM: Cupping?

3073
03:51:32,725 --> 03:51:36,824
ASHLEY: Little pinch.

3074
03:51:36,824 --> 03:51:41,307
MATT: She gets additional 1d8. It's 5d8 additional
damage.

3075
03:51:41,307 --> 03:51:43,883
SAM: Trumping right now?

3076
03:51:43,883 --> 03:51:48,544
MARISHA: No, this is our fantasy land, man.

3077
03:51:48,544 --> 03:51:54,932
TALIESIN: No! Nixing it! This is my safe place.

3078
03:51:54,932 --> 03:52:00,767
MATT: 48 points of damage in one strike from Kima
against Yenk.

3079
03:52:00,767 --> 03:52:04,045
TRAVIS: Just from the attack of opportunity?

3080
03:52:04,045 --> 03:52:08,105
MATT: Just attack of opportunity, yeah. She poured a
level four Divine Smite spell into it and (impacts)

3081
03:52:08,105 --> 03:52:14,523
as she slams behind. Fiends are a paladin's
thing. As Yenk's running away towards you, Grog,

3082
03:52:14,523 --> 03:52:18,531
she says, "No, you don't!" (impacts) Slams up with
her maul and strikes at the side of Yenk, causing

3083
03:52:18,531 --> 03:52:24,582
him to tumble. He's still keeping his trajectory,
though. He slams forward towards you. That's more

3084
03:52:24,582 --> 03:52:31,268
than 15 feet. He's going for a gore attack against
you, Grog, with the horns, like he did with

3085
03:52:31,268 --> 03:52:32,442
Vorugal at the beginning of the battle.

3086
03:52:32,442 --> 03:52:34,523
LIAM: He's going to take 15 percent of your hit
points.

3087
03:52:34,523 --> 03:52:39,739
MATT: (chuckles) Yeah. That is a 22.

3088
03:52:39,739 --> 03:52:41,352
TRAVIS: That'll hit.

3089
03:52:41,352 --> 03:52:43,519
SAM: Can I Cutting Words that?

3090
03:52:43,519 --> 03:52:45,927
MATT: I don't think you're in range.

3091
03:52:45,927 --> 03:52:47,591
SAM: Am I 60 feet?

3092
03:52:47,591 --> 03:53:00,812
MATT: 60 feet? Let me se. 60. Just out of range.
You suffer 55 points of

3093
03:53:00,812 --> 03:53:10,812
piercing damage from the horns, halved, plus an
additional 38 points of piercing damage from the

3094
03:53:10,812 --> 03:53:14,296
momentum from the gore.

3095
03:53:14,296 --> 03:53:17,608
TRAVIS: And you said additional 30?

3096
03:53:17,608 --> 03:53:19,202
MATT: Additional 38.

3097
03:53:19,202 --> 03:53:25,081
TRAVIS: Additional 38, so that's halved also. 19?

3098
03:53:25,081 --> 03:53:32,360
MATT: 19 on top of the half. Plus an additional
seven points of cold damage as the horns strike

3099
03:53:32,360 --> 03:53:40,254
into you, the horns almost solidify into ice
spikes as it hits you, the ice breaking off.

3100
03:53:40,254 --> 03:53:42,413
SAM: Would have been great against a fucking
dragon.

3101
03:53:42,413 --> 03:53:45,194
LAURA: It did. It did the fire damage against the
dragon.

3102
03:53:45,194 --> 03:53:50,439
TRAVIS: 48 points of damage.

3103
03:53:50,439 --> 03:54:00,022
MATT: Okay. There you go. That ends Yenk's turn.
It is now Vorugal's turn. Vorugal's pissed and

3104
03:54:00,022 --> 03:54:03,122
hurt and angry and is going to move away.

3105
03:54:03,122 --> 03:54:05,773
LAURA: You get an attack of opportunity!

3106
03:54:05,773 --> 03:54:07,178
LIAM: Did he move away?

3107
03:54:07,178 --> 03:54:08,587
MATT: You do get one, yeah.

3108
03:54:08,587 --> 03:54:11,988
LIAM: Yeah. No sneak attack because it's just me
and Bigby, right?

3109
03:54:11,988 --> 03:54:19,909
MATT: Currently, yes. You don't get sneak attack
here, no.

3110
03:54:19,909 --> 03:54:28,917
LIAM: Right, because there's nobody here with me.
27 hits, so that is a three plus eight is 11, plus

3111
03:54:28,917 --> 03:54:31,578
my psychic damage is 12.

3112
03:54:31,578 --> 03:54:34,500
LAURA: How do you want to do this?

3113
03:54:34,500 --> 03:54:37,371
LIAM: That'd be great, cut him in the butt.

3114
03:54:37,371 --> 03:54:43,186
MATT: Nice. That's some good luck with the
ice breath this battle.

3115
03:54:43,186 --> 03:54:45,376
TRAVIS: There are three giant monsters.

3116
03:54:45,376 --> 03:54:49,975
MARISHA: Jesus, he's back for my shit. He's back
for me and you, Pike.

3117
03:54:49,975 --> 03:54:52,825
MATT: I need Keyleth, Pike, and Scanlan to all
make constitution saving throws.

3118
03:54:52,825 --> 03:54:55,709
SAM: Oh boy.

3119
03:54:55,709 --> 03:54:59,219
MARISHA: Okay. 18.

3120
03:54:59,219 --> 03:55:00,708
MATT: 18.

3121
03:55:00,708 --> 03:55:03,426
SAM: 15.

3122
03:55:03,426 --> 03:55:09,333
MATT: Pike? All right, all three of you guys take
72 points of cold damage.

3123
03:55:09,333 --> 03:55:20,814
LAURA: Okay. So that's unconscious.

3124
03:55:20,814 --> 03:55:25,850
MATT: So Pike is unconscious. Scanlan?

3125
03:55:25,850 --> 03:55:26,920
SAM: I'm okay.

3126
03:55:26,920 --> 03:55:29,106
MATT: You're okay? What's your hit points?

3127
03:55:29,106 --> 03:55:33,213
SAM: I healed myself last time just the amount of
hit points I have right now.

3128
03:55:33,213 --> 03:55:36,493
MATT: (laughs) Keyleth, where you at?

3129
03:55:36,493 --> 03:55:48,153
MARISHA: I'm at 36. Luckily I also healed myself up.

3130
03:55:48,170 --> 03:55:56,494
LIAM: I'm a field medic. I'll get you out.

3131
03:55:56,494 --> 03:55:59,691
MATT: All right, and for the rest of Vorugal's
turn...

3132
03:55:59,691 --> 03:56:19,084
LAURA: What the fuck are you doing now, Matthew?

3133
03:56:19,084 --> 03:56:21,876
MARISHA: This isn't good.

3134
03:56:21,876 --> 03:56:23,817
LAURA: Are you unconscious, too?

3135
03:56:23,817 --> 03:56:28,026
MARISHA: I'm up, but Pike isn't, correct?

3136
03:56:28,026 --> 03:56:34,805
MATT: Pike is currently unconscious, yeah. That
ends Vorugal's turn. Grog, you're up.

3137
03:56:34,805 --> 03:56:38,244
SAM: You're not unconscious, Marisha?

3138
03:56:38,244 --> 03:56:46,870
MARISHA: I'm not. Pike is. There is an exit door.
We can literally toss Pike's ass in the door. How

3139
03:56:46,870 --> 03:56:49,197
many are you down, Pike?

3140
03:56:49,197 --> 03:56:52,777
TRAVIS: Can I go to a frenzied rage and unload on
Yenk?

3141
03:56:52,777 --> 03:56:54,258
MATT: Yes, you can.

3142
03:56:54,258 --> 03:57:06,167
TRAVIS: Okay. This will be reckless attack. Great
weapon master. Because fuck it. Why not? 28 for

3143
03:57:06,167 --> 03:57:07,501
the first one.

3144
03:57:07,501 --> 03:57:09,252
MATT: That hits.

3145
03:57:09,252 --> 03:57:10,466
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

3146
03:57:10,466 --> 03:57:12,784
(shouting)

3147
03:57:12,784 --> 03:57:14,446
ASHLEY: Get him.

3148
03:57:14,446 --> 03:57:18,143
TRAVIS: And 27 for the third.

3149
03:57:18,143 --> 03:57:24,012
MATT: Yeah, all three hit. The middle one gets
critical. Don't forget your additional 1d4

3150
03:57:24,012 --> 03:57:27,139
damage with your axe because you're enlarged.

3151
03:57:27,139 --> 03:57:31,429
MARISHA: And those were all great weapon master?
That's fucking awesome!

3152
03:57:31,429 --> 03:57:43,184
TRAVIS: The first one is 15 plus six points of
necrotic damage. 21.

3153
03:57:43,184 --> 03:57:45,049
MATT: Including the 1d4?

3154
03:57:45,049 --> 03:57:48,211
TRAVIS: 25.

3155
03:57:48,211 --> 03:57:51,897
MATT: 25. Does that includes the ten for great
weapon master?

3156
03:57:51,897 --> 03:57:53,114
TRAVIS: Nope.

3157
03:57:53,114 --> 03:58:01,246
MATT: So 35 points of damage on the first strike.
All right. Second attack, which is the critical.

3158
03:58:01,246 --> 03:58:03,874
LAURA: All dice are doubled? Is that how it
works?

3159
03:58:03,874 --> 03:58:11,025
MATT: Yeah, all dice rolls double. Roll a d12,
plus d6, plus d4.

3160
03:58:11,025 --> 03:58:21,690
TRAVIS: That's an 11. It's a six. One.

3161
03:58:21,690 --> 03:58:32,418
MATT: 18 times two. (laughs) 36 plus ten. 46, plus
2d12 because of brutal critical.

3162
03:58:32,418 --> 03:58:39,869
TRAVIS: One. Six. Seven. Seven extra points.

3163
03:58:39,869 --> 03:58:51,705
MATT: Plus 46. 53 points of damage with the second
strike. Roll damage for the third one.

3164
03:58:51,705 --> 03:58:53,737
LIAM: Maniac! Here it is! Get it!

3165
03:58:53,737 --> 03:58:56,218
SAM: Finally, he gets to attack! It's been six
months since we've seen

3166
03:58:56,218 --> 03:58:58,097
you actually attack anything.

3167
03:58:58,097 --> 03:59:01,942
LAURA: I know, and he kills everything.

3168
03:59:01,942 --> 03:59:04,192
LIAM: This is a rage spanking, right here.

3169
03:59:04,192 --> 03:59:05,642
TRAVIS: 28 on the third one.

3170
03:59:05,642 --> 03:59:09,771
MATT: 28 on the third. Nice. You did over 100
damage on one round of melee combat.

3171
03:59:09,771 --> 03:59:15,507
LAURA: Did you add your ten to the final one? 
It was 38 on the final.

3172
03:59:15,507 --> 03:59:23,187
MATT: (laughs) Jesus! So as you angrily get up,
your large, draconic form, you rush forward,

3173
03:59:23,187 --> 03:59:27,845
stepping right up to where Yenk is slamming into
you. And after goring you in the chest, you

3174
03:59:27,845 --> 03:59:34,221
embrace the anger and (impacts) bring the axe
down, right into the inside of the shoulder. For

3175
03:59:34,282 --> 03:59:39,135
the final attack, you put a foot up and drag it
down across, cutting into it. You see a bunch of

3176
03:59:39,135 --> 03:59:43,079
black-blue blood scatter across the snow,
darkening it, the snow immediately melting with

3177
03:59:43,079 --> 03:59:51,866
a (sizzling) hissing sound as it impacts with the
ground around you. Yenk looks visibly hurt now.

3178
03:59:51,866 --> 03:59:53,444
He's like, (pained grunts).

3179
03:59:53,444 --> 03:59:55,656
LAURA: Can we see a little spire poking 
through its belly?

3180
03:59:55,656 --> 04:00:05,212
MATT: No, but you do see that the red, beady,
coal-like flame eyes of Yenk are now burning with

3181
04:00:05,212 --> 04:00:07,951
a vibrant red and are focused entirely on
you.

3182
04:00:08,072 --> 04:00:10,742
TRAVIS: I've got everything you want, big boy.

3183
04:00:10,742 --> 04:00:13,534
MATT: All right. That ends Grog's turn, I believe?
Scanlan, you're up.

3184
04:00:13,534 --> 04:00:16,267
SAM: Me? Oh, shit. Okay.

3185
04:00:16,267 --> 04:00:24,658
MATT: Actually, at the end of Grog's turn, Vorugal
is going to use one of his legendary actions to

3186
04:00:24,658 --> 04:00:28,848
attempt a tail attack, which has a reach of 20
feet. You are within 20 feet.

3187
04:00:28,848 --> 04:00:30,128
SAM: Against me?

3188
04:00:30,128 --> 04:00:36,200
MATT: Yep. That is cocked. 18 plus 14 is 32?

3189
04:00:36,200 --> 04:00:37,303
SAM: Yeah.

3190
04:00:37,303 --> 04:00:45,087
MATT: You take (counting) 16 points of bludgeoning
damage.

3191
04:00:45,087 --> 04:00:50,940
SAM: I'm going to use Cutting Words to reduce the
damage. As I see the tail coming, I pick up my

3192
04:00:50,940 --> 04:01:06,437
book of Shakespeare insults, and I will say: with
thy brawls, thou hast disturbed our sport! I love

3193
04:01:06,437 --> 04:01:09,332
thee not. Therefore, pursue me not.

3194
04:01:09,332 --> 04:01:12,481
MATT: As the tail swings towards you, roll a d12.

3195
04:01:12,481 --> 04:01:18,005
SAM: Six. And I live.

3196
04:01:18,005 --> 04:01:20,490
(laughter)

3197
04:01:20,490 --> 04:01:24,052
SAM: It was 14 points of damage?

3198
04:01:24,052 --> 04:01:30,197
MATT: It was seven plus eight, so it would have
been 16. It was eight plus eight. 16.

3199
04:01:30,197 --> 04:01:36,470
SAM: So reduced to ten. I'm okay. I have four
points left.

3200
04:01:36,470 --> 04:01:39,091
MATT: Oh shit!

3201
04:01:39,091 --> 04:01:41,094
SAM: My turn?

3202
04:01:41,094 --> 04:01:42,488
MATT: Now it's your turn.

3203
04:01:42,488 --> 04:01:48,635
SAM: I look at Pike, and with my bonus action, I
will heal her. Healing Word, second level. I will

3204
04:01:48,635 --> 04:02:02,708
sing to her, (singing) you're trying to kill a
white dragon, just like the ones we used to kill.

3205
04:02:02,708 --> 04:02:12,784
May your days be merry and bright, and I hope we
all survive this fight.

3206
04:02:12,784 --> 04:02:16,327
(speaking) Okay, so 2d4, right?

3207
04:02:16,327 --> 04:02:18,614
MATT: 2d4 plus six.

3208
04:02:18,614 --> 04:02:20,439
SAM: 13 points.

3209
04:02:20,439 --> 04:02:22,216
MATT: Pike is up 13 points.

3210
04:02:22,216 --> 04:02:30,154
SAM: Shit. I've got to get out of here. Are you
okay, Pike?

3211
04:02:30,154 --> 04:02:32,800
ASHLEY: I am at 13.

3212
04:02:32,800 --> 04:02:35,106
SAM: Are you going to be okay?

3213
04:02:35,106 --> 04:02:38,990
ASHLEY: Well, I'm going to run away. I'll be
fine.

3214
04:02:38,990 --> 04:02:42,277
MARISHA: Don't forget, you can go in the mansion.
Pop in the mansion to heal.

3215
04:02:42,277 --> 04:02:44,232
SAM: I don't want to be a coward.

3216
04:02:44,232 --> 04:02:46,536
LAURA: You can be a coward, Scanlan. It's okay.

3217
04:02:46,536 --> 04:02:49,188
ASHLEY: You're at four, Scanlan.

3218
04:02:49,188 --> 04:02:57,521
SAM: Shit. Well, I'll move away from it. Wait, I'm
within its melee?

3219
04:02:57,521 --> 04:02:59,533
MATT: Yes, you are within range.

3220
04:02:59,533 --> 04:03:01,106
SAM: Jesus. That far away?

3221
04:03:01,106 --> 04:03:06,521
MATT: It has a 15-foot bite reach, a ten-foot claw
reach, and a 20-foot tail reach.

3222
04:03:06,521 --> 04:03:21,537
SAM: Oh my god. Okay. I don't want to hit it. I
don't want to go away. Fuck. I don't want to leave

3223
04:03:21,537 --> 04:03:26,403
my Pikey. I'm not going to leave my Pikey. You
never leave your wingman. No.

3224
04:03:26,403 --> 04:03:31,936
LAURA: Four, Scanlan! Get somewhere safe. That
way, you can keep helping her.

3225
04:03:31,936 --> 04:03:38,293
MARISHA: If he takes you down and multi-attacks
you, he could kill you. You healed her, right?

3226
04:03:38,293 --> 04:03:39,646
She's conscious now.

3227
04:03:39,646 --> 04:03:41,757
SAM: I Dimension Door away.

3228
04:03:41,757 --> 04:03:43,109
MATT: To where?

3229
04:03:43,109 --> 04:03:53,033
SAM: Over in Yenkville, but not in Yenk range.

3230
04:03:53,033 --> 04:03:54,144
MATT: Over here?

3231
04:03:54,144 --> 04:03:55,892
SAM: Yeah, there you go.

3232
04:03:55,892 --> 04:03:57,866
TRAVIS: In Yenk-adjacent?

3233
04:03:57,866 --> 04:04:00,181
SAM: Yeah. The suburbs of Yenkville.

3234
04:04:00,181 --> 04:04:02,049
LIAM: Mighty Yenky has struck out.

3235
04:04:02,049 --> 04:04:08,299
MATT: All right, that brings us to Vax.

3236
04:04:08,299 --> 04:04:19,759
LIAM: I know that from here to here, I'm 100 feet,
so from the angle, am I 180 feet away to Pike?

3237
04:04:19,759 --> 04:04:22,283
MATT: Scanlan, by the way, I need you to make two
concentration saving throws.

3238
04:04:22,283 --> 04:04:26,235
Make two constitution saves.

3239
04:04:26,235 --> 04:04:29,518
SAM: With advantage?

3240
04:04:29,518 --> 04:04:31,551
MATT: Well, it's one of them with advantage, so
roll twice.

3241
04:04:31,551 --> 04:04:33,891
SAM: I rolled twice. One was a 17 and one was a
ten.

3242
04:04:33,891 --> 04:04:38,497
MATT: Yeah, even with the bonuses, Bigby's Hand is
gone.

3243
04:04:38,497 --> 04:04:42,141
TALIESIN: It would have been 19.

3244
04:04:42,141 --> 04:04:47,844
MATT: You took full damage from the last blast, so
that would have been 72. Half of that would have

3245
04:04:47,844 --> 04:04:50,394
been-- you had to roll a 36.

3246
04:04:50,394 --> 04:04:56,231
LIAM: I want to save one action to grab Pike and
yank her, so that means I have an action and a

3247
04:04:56,231 --> 04:05:07,444
bonus action and movement to fly a total of 360
feet, halved, which is 180 feet to Pike, like a

3248
04:05:07,444 --> 04:05:09,880
rocket. Grab her and roll into the door of the
mansion.

3249
04:05:09,880 --> 04:05:16,552
MATT: Okay, so as you dart past and grab her--

3250
04:05:16,552 --> 04:05:18,897
LAURA: Oh, does he get an attack of opportunity on
you because you fly by?

3251
04:05:18,897 --> 04:05:21,658
LIAM: I can arc.

3252
04:05:21,658 --> 04:05:24,239
MATT: You're then taking your action to grab her.

3253
04:05:24,239 --> 04:05:27,338
LIAM: And roll us into the door.

3254
04:05:27,338 --> 04:05:32,759
MATT: Okay. You are leaving his combat range in
doing so, so he's going to get his attack of

3255
04:05:32,759 --> 04:05:42,543
opportunity on you, as part of his bite strike
against you. That is 18 plus 14, so 32.

3256
04:05:42,543 --> 04:05:51,243
LIAM: That hits. Do I have momentum, grabbing
her?

3257
04:05:51,243 --> 04:05:54,233
MATT: If it drops you, you drop, and you drop with
her.

3258
04:05:54,233 --> 04:06:03,203
LIAM: I would imagine I did this. That's the
intention. Up and over.

3259
04:06:03,203 --> 04:06:06,909
MATT: I understand that. The attack of a bite is
going to change your trajectory of a dragon

3260
04:06:06,909 --> 04:06:09,687
slashing at you. That is eight--

3261
04:06:09,687 --> 04:06:12,570
LIAM: I'm out, dude. I've got five hit points.

3262
04:06:12,570 --> 04:06:18,185
MATT: Total would be eight plus eight, plus an
additional 4d6 cold damage. Yeah. You grab Pike.

3263
04:06:18,185 --> 04:06:24,588
As you begin to try to make the way, the bite
snatches into you and lifts you up and throws you

3264
04:06:24,588 --> 04:06:27,748
to the ground next to Pike, and you're both there
on the ground.

3265
04:06:27,748 --> 04:06:29,751
LIAM: But he bit <i>me,</i> right?

3266
04:06:29,751 --> 04:06:33,932
MATT: Yes, didn't bite Pike. You're both right
outside of the door right now.

3267
04:06:33,932 --> 04:06:37,836
SAM: Pike's alive, and she's super strong.

3268
04:06:37,836 --> 04:06:41,189
MARISHA: I'm just watching everybody barrel to my
feet?

3269
04:06:41,189 --> 04:06:42,519
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

3270
04:06:42,519 --> 04:06:44,580
LAURA: My boyfriend!

3271
04:06:44,580 --> 04:06:49,849
MATT: That ends Vax's turn. Vex, you're up.

3272
04:06:49,849 --> 04:06:58,878
LAURA: Fuck. I'm going to try to get his attention
and say, hey, stupid! And then I'm going to hit

3273
04:06:58,878 --> 04:07:01,500
him because that's all I've got.

3274
04:07:01,500 --> 04:07:04,026
MATT: Okay, go for it.

3275
04:07:04,026 --> 04:07:09,193
LAURA: 22?

3276
04:07:09,193 --> 04:07:11,709
MATT: 22 does hit.

3277
04:07:11,709 --> 04:07:18,534
LAURA: Do I have sneak attack on him, at all?
Marisha is next to him.

3278
04:07:18,534 --> 04:07:22,849
MATT: No, he's within range for Marisha. Marisha
is not threatening him, at the moment.

3279
04:07:22,849 --> 04:07:27,198
LAURA: So no sneak attack, although I was hidden
at the end of last turn.

3280
04:07:27,198 --> 04:07:32,632
MATT: You were. He did not see you.

3281
04:07:32,632 --> 04:07:35,409
ASHLEY: I'm threatening him.

3282
04:07:35,409 --> 04:07:40,000
MATT: (laughs) You're growling at him.

3283
04:07:40,000 --> 04:07:57,514
LAURA: (counting) 28 on the first.

3284
04:07:57,514 --> 04:07:59,025
MATT: That hits.

3285
04:07:59,025 --> 04:08:04,623
LAURA: That was damage. And then the second attack
hits. It's a 31. (counting)

3286
04:08:04,623 --> 04:08:24,205
MATT: These are sharpshooter shots? It's the 1d10,
plus bonus--

3287
04:08:24,205 --> 04:08:31,371
LAURA: 1d8, plus eight, plus two for dragon, plus
Hunter's Mark.

3288
04:08:31,371 --> 04:08:35,000
MATT: Right, there we go. Second one is how much
damage?

3289
04:08:35,000 --> 04:08:39,658
LAURA: 24, with two lighting damage. The first one
had four lightning damage.

3290
04:08:39,658 --> 04:08:41,796
MATT: Okay. Does that end your turn?

3291
04:08:41,796 --> 04:08:51,400
LAURA: (sighs) I want to help, I just don't know
what I can do. That's all I can keep doing. I'm

3292
04:08:51,400 --> 04:08:53,959
going to use my bonus action to hide.

3293
04:08:53,959 --> 04:08:57,448
MATT: Go for it. Roll a stealth check.

3294
04:08:57,448 --> 04:09:01,328
LAURA: Like an asshole. 13.

3295
04:09:01,328 --> 04:09:10,770
MATT: Okay. End of your turn, Vorugal's going to
use his second legendary action and is going to

3296
04:09:10,770 --> 04:09:16,080
swing around with the tail over the top of the
rock (impact) to slam down on the conscious Pike.

3297
04:09:16,080 --> 04:09:24,907
You are prone. It has advantage on the attack roll
against you. That is 28 to hit.

3298
04:09:24,907 --> 04:09:27,034
ASHLEY: Yeah, that hits.

3299
04:09:27,034 --> 04:09:35,361
MATT: 22 points of bludgeoning damage.

3300
04:09:35,361 --> 04:09:38,475
ASHLEY: I'm out.

3301
04:09:38,475 --> 04:09:46,536
MATT: Pike's now unconscious. Okay. Vorugal is now
in this ravenous, primal rage, and is trying to

3302
04:09:46,536 --> 04:09:53,740
finish things off successively that have been a
problem. Now, with that, both of them are

3303
04:09:53,740 --> 04:09:56,991
unconscious on the ground, Scanlan's out of the
picture, Keyleth is still standing right by the

3304
04:09:56,991 --> 04:10:02,488
side of the tree. Pike, you're up next, so I need
you to go ahead and roll a death saving throw.

3305
04:10:02,488 --> 04:10:04,817
Roll a d20.

3306
04:10:04,817 --> 04:10:09,197
TALIESIN: This is where being at the end of
everything is great.

3307
04:10:09,197 --> 04:10:10,877
LIAM: 20.

3308
04:10:10,877 --> 04:10:17,243
MATT: A 20? Natural 20? You are stabilized. You
gain one hit point. You're conscious.

3309
04:10:17,243 --> 04:10:23,792
MARISHA: Holy shit. That changes everything!

3310
04:10:23,792 --> 04:10:33,463
ASHLEY: I'll take that hit point. Okay. I don't
even know what that means.

3311
04:10:33,463 --> 04:10:38,780
MATT: You're conscious again. The tail slams you,
and you go out, and then as the tail pulls away,

3312
04:10:38,780 --> 04:10:45,368
(gasps) you catch yourself again. Your turn's
over, but you're back. Pulling the tail back.

3313
04:10:45,368 --> 04:10:46,661
That's the end of your turn.

3314
04:10:46,661 --> 04:10:49,445
ASHLEY: I didn't do anything.

3315
04:10:49,445 --> 04:10:54,359
MATT: Your turn was the death saving throw. You
take that at the end of your turn. You woke up at

3316
04:10:54,359 --> 04:10:58,882
the end of it. At the end of your turn, Vorugal
uses the third and final legendary action for this

3317
04:10:58,882 --> 04:11:03,658
round and with a 20-foot range, is going to swing
the tail around, breaking through the tree,

3318
04:11:03,658 --> 04:11:08,767
towards Keyleth. That is a 29 to hit.

3319
04:11:08,767 --> 04:11:17,598
MARISHA: Yeah. Wait, is this melee? Does this come
into play with the cloak? So you're at

3320
04:11:17,598 --> 04:11:18,878
disadvantage.

3321
04:11:18,878 --> 04:11:32,158
MATT: That is a 24. Ancient dragon, sorry. That is
22 points of bludgeoning damage.

3322
04:11:32,158 --> 04:11:46,984
MARISHA: And that's it? I'm still alive! (roars)
22? Okay. I have 14 hit points.

3323
04:11:46,984 --> 04:11:51,489
MATT: All right. Now it's your turn, Keyleth.

3324
04:11:51,489 --> 04:11:53,194
MARISHA: Now it's my turn.

3325
04:11:53,194 --> 04:11:55,129
LIAM: Go earth elemental!

3326
04:11:55,129 --> 04:12:02,858
MARISHA: I'm so torn, you guys. Do I heal you
guys, or do I do damage and go earth elemental?

3327
04:12:02,858 --> 04:12:08,465
It's a big decision. Scanlan?

3328
04:12:08,465 --> 04:12:09,901
SAM: It's all on you.

3329
04:12:09,901 --> 04:12:11,298
MARISHA: Pike, you're at one?

3330
04:12:11,298 --> 04:12:12,371
ASHLEY: I'm at one.

3331
04:12:12,371 --> 04:12:13,719
MARISHA: You're down.

3332
04:12:13,719 --> 04:12:16,357
TRAVIS: I'm doing real good.

3333
04:12:16,357 --> 04:12:23,726
MARISHA: What do I do, guys? Do I try and kill
him, or do I heal?

3334
04:12:23,726 --> 04:12:28,511
SAM: You've got two nearly dead people
right next to you who are feet away from a

3335
04:12:28,511 --> 04:12:29,818
mansion.

3336
04:12:29,818 --> 04:12:32,363
LAURA: Can you Grasping Vine them through the
mansion door? It's open, right?

3337
04:12:32,363 --> 04:12:36,024
MATT: The vine wouldn't pull them through the door
because you can only create it within a space

3338
04:12:36,024 --> 04:12:37,897
where a natural plant would grow.

3339
04:12:37,897 --> 04:12:41,693
MARISHA: It doesn't work like that,
unfortunately.

3340
04:12:41,693 --> 04:12:43,976
SAM: But you can throw them, as a beasty
elemental.

3341
04:12:43,976 --> 04:12:48,442
MATT: What are you going to do, Keyleth? Hurry
up.

3342
04:12:48,442 --> 04:12:50,269
MARISHA: Okay, fuck!

3343
04:12:50,269 --> 04:12:52,630
SAM: When I left the mansion, I locked it.

3344
04:12:52,630 --> 04:12:56,594
TRAVIS: Did the key break off when you locked it?

3345
04:12:56,594 --> 04:13:00,138
SAM: No, it's a code lock. And I forgot the code!

3346
04:13:00,138 --> 04:13:13,517
MARISHA: I'm going to cast Sunbeam. I'm going to
beam in his face.

3347
04:13:13,517 --> 04:13:15,226
SAM: On Yenk, of course.

3348
04:13:15,226 --> 04:13:21,402
MARISHA: It's okay. I've got this. Beam in his
face.

3349
04:13:21,402 --> 04:13:27,682
MATT: Okay, so you cast Sunbeam. 60-foot line,
five-foot wide. Right past that way. Okay.

3350
04:13:27,682 --> 04:13:30,400
TALIESIN: Actually, does that hit both of them?

3351
04:13:30,400 --> 04:13:33,483
MARISHA: 60 foot, right through them? Can I?

3352
04:13:33,483 --> 04:13:38,429
MATT: You might have to reposition to do so.

3353
04:13:38,429 --> 04:13:46,116
MARISHA: What, scooch over one? Yeah, I'll
scooch over one. Take a side step to line them up.

3354
04:13:46,116 --> 04:13:49,799
MATT: You get around the tree and past the rock.
Yeah, you can hit both of them.

3355
04:13:49,799 --> 04:13:53,683
MARISHA: They have to make a constitution save.

3356
04:13:53,683 --> 04:14:02,305
MATT: Vorugal, that is a 32. Yenk is a 27. They
both make it.

3357
04:14:02,305 --> 04:14:12,204
MARISHA: Well, they still take half damage. It's
6d8. Normally, they take full damage and they're

3358
04:14:12,204 --> 04:14:29,709
blinded. It would have been way cooler if it would
have worked. Ooh, that's a good roll. 26 points of

3359
04:14:29,709 --> 04:14:31,383
radiant damage.

3360
04:14:31,383 --> 04:14:34,190
MATT: 26, then halved?

3361
04:14:34,190 --> 04:14:40,453
MARISHA: Then halved. And then I'm going to go air
elemental form.

3362
04:14:40,453 --> 04:14:52,436
MATT: Embracing the age-old tradition of the Air
Ashari, Keyleth vanishes into a form of swirling

3363
04:14:52,436 --> 04:14:56,861
wind, picking up the various bits of sleet and
snow around you.

3364
04:14:56,861 --> 04:15:01,267
You're almost like a slushy tornado.

3365
04:15:01,267 --> 04:15:09,400
MARISHA: That's cool. Can I then take whatever
movement I have left to try and drag--

3366
04:15:09,400 --> 04:15:13,671
MATT: You've already used your action to cast the
spell, unfortunately.

3367
04:15:13,671 --> 04:15:16,707
MARISHA: I can't use my movement to try and move
someone?

3368
04:15:16,707 --> 04:15:19,210
MATT: You can use your movement to move. To pull
somebody with you--

3369
04:15:19,210 --> 04:15:20,595
MARISHA: That's an action?

3370
04:15:20,595 --> 04:15:24,480
LIAM: It's all right. I'm fine.

3371
04:15:24,480 --> 04:15:36,006
MARISHA: Then I'm going to use my movement to go
airborne. I think I can go 60 feet? Let me see my

3372
04:15:36,006 --> 04:15:43,127
fly speed. I have 90 feet.

3373
04:15:43,127 --> 04:15:45,650
MATT: 90 feet, so it would be 45 feet up, if you
want to.

3374
04:15:45,650 --> 04:15:47,466
MARISHA: Yeah.

3375
04:15:47,466 --> 04:15:51,846
LAURA: Kick him on the way up, and then he'll
follow you.

3376
04:15:51,846 --> 04:15:58,029
MARISHA: I give him a little air poof kick in the
face, just for flavor.

3377
04:15:58,029 --> 04:16:01,472
MATT: Sure, why not?

3378
04:16:01,472 --> 04:16:04,087
MARISHA: He's getting slushied in the face.

3379
04:16:04,087 --> 04:16:11,032
MATT: You rush up into the air. Vorugal does not
get an attack of opportunity because he already

3380
04:16:11,032 --> 04:16:14,692
used his reaction against you. So you (whoosh)
without an issue.

3381
04:16:14,692 --> 04:16:17,414
MARISHA: I hope that was right.

3382
04:16:17,414 --> 04:16:19,599
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Percy.

3383
04:16:19,599 --> 04:16:25,284
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to take my three shots.

3384
04:16:25,284 --> 04:16:31,587
MATT: Right above you, you see Raishan, wings
beating, looking over and assessing the

3385
04:16:31,587 --> 04:16:36,701
battlefield. You see Vorugal down there, bloody.
You see Yenk, bloodied. Both engaged and

3386
04:16:36,701 --> 04:16:41,170
distracted. You are currently not in either of
their attentive sphere.

3387
04:16:41,170 --> 04:16:46,137
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, so the first thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to use my bonus action to reload.

3388
04:16:46,137 --> 04:16:56,822
I'm going to take my three shots at the white
dragon with what I have left. I can do nothing.

3389
04:16:56,822 --> 04:17:02,863
That's 30.

3390
04:17:02,863 --> 04:17:04,183
MATT: 30 hits.

3391
04:17:04,183 --> 04:17:25,939
TALIESIN: One necrotic. 12 points, with one
necrotic. Shot number one. Next shot, same thing.

3392
04:17:25,939 --> 04:17:35,882
Standard shot. That ran, but 22? Oh, sorry. It's
not 22. I'm so tired. 17. That misses.

3393
04:17:35,882 --> 04:17:40,586
MATT: 17 misses, unfortunately. It hits the side,
but the shot shatters across the dragonhide.

3394
04:17:40,586 --> 04:17:44,134
ASHLEY: Can I do War God's Blessing from where I'm
at?

3395
04:17:44,134 --> 04:17:55,228
MATT: You know what? Hold on, Percy. You are
conscious on the ground, barely paying attention,

3396
04:17:55,228 --> 04:18:00,640
and all of a sudden, you hear the shot go off, and
you see it about to blast against the hide. As a

3397
04:18:00,640 --> 04:18:05,736
war cleric? I'll see if he has to be within range,
or if it's one of the things that you can do if he

3398
04:18:05,736 --> 04:18:15,791
attacks an enemy. The creature has to be within 30
feet of you, so no. He's way too far.

3399
04:18:15,791 --> 04:18:17,639
TALIESIN: 24 for the next shot.

3400
04:18:17,639 --> 04:18:19,361
MATT: Third one does hit.

3401
04:18:19,361 --> 04:18:29,976
TALIESIN: That's 12 points, with two points of
necrotic. And I'm going to grab my rope, and I'm

3402
04:18:29,976 --> 04:18:33,418
going to wave at the green dragon and start
dropping down.

3403
04:18:33,418 --> 04:18:34,632
MATT: Okay.

3404
04:18:34,632 --> 04:18:38,319
TALIESIN: I have a rope.

3405
04:18:38,319 --> 04:18:46,781
MATT: I know you do. As you leap off the side, the
clench in the stone (tink) comes loose, and you

3406
04:18:46,781 --> 04:18:49,992
(impacts) tumble down the hill. I need you to make
an acrobatics check.

3407
04:18:49,992 --> 04:18:56,139
TALIESIN: Yeah! I can do that, even at negative
one, I can do that. No, I can't. That was a one.

3408
04:18:56,139 --> 04:19:08,871
MATT: Natural one? You tumble Homer Simpson-style
(repeated impacts) down the icy, rocky side,

3409
04:19:08,871 --> 04:19:19,474
landing prone and suffering 18 points of
bludgeoning damage on the way, landing prone on

3410
04:19:19,474 --> 04:19:22,839
the ground. (impact, groan)

3411
04:19:22,839 --> 04:19:24,426
TALIESIN: Fine!

3412
04:19:24,426 --> 04:19:34,949
MATT: Kima's turn. Kima's going to go and flank
Yenk against Grog, giving her advantage on her

3413
04:19:34,949 --> 04:19:49,681
first attack. Yeah, that's a 25 to hit, and her
second attack is-- yeah, both hit. The first

3414
04:19:49,681 --> 04:20:06,235
strike with her Holy Thunder Maul. 19 points of
damage against the goristro, and she's going to

3415
04:20:06,235 --> 04:20:25,686
burn another 3rd-level spell to do a holy smite at
third level. All righty. 23 additional radiant

3416
04:20:25,686 --> 04:20:33,278
damage on top of that, and then her second strike,
she's going to burn her last 3rd-level spell to do

3417
04:20:33,278 --> 04:20:54,404
another smite. That is 16. (counting) 31. Nice!
Yeah, she did a lot of damage on that round.

3418
04:20:54,404 --> 04:20:59,513
Slamming twice with the maul into the backside of
Yenk. The first one slams into the shoulder,

3419
04:20:59,513 --> 04:21:04,078
sending him to the ground with his fist. (grunts)
He starts getting back up. She spins, using the

3420
04:21:04,078 --> 04:21:09,085
inertia, and slams the maul into the side of his
knee, which pops out and sends him down onto one

3421
04:21:09,085 --> 04:21:14,373
knee now, and Yenk is basically half-prostrate in
front of you, Grog, preparing for your next round

3422
04:21:14,373 --> 04:21:20,506
of combat. (growls) Ending Kima's turn. It is now
Raishan's turn.

3423
04:21:20,506 --> 04:21:22,436
TRAVIS: She made him bend the knee.

3424
04:21:22,436 --> 04:21:34,577
MATT: Raishan does not get the breath back.
However, is going to fly. Not used to the ice and

3425
04:21:34,577 --> 04:21:38,938
can't quite get to full speed there, but can get
close enough to attempt a Blight spell, at the

3426
04:21:38,938 --> 04:21:45,660
very least. Vorugal fails. That's an 18. Yeah,
fails the save.

3427
04:21:45,660 --> 04:21:49,037
LAURA: Blight spell.

3428
04:21:49,037 --> 04:21:55,192
MARISHA: A lot of damage. Come on.

3429
04:21:55,192 --> 04:21:57,527
SAM: He's going to resist it.

3430
04:21:57,527 --> 04:22:01,787
TALIESIN: He might have burned it.

3431
04:22:01,787 --> 04:22:08,325
MATT: Yeah, burning a legendary resistance to make
it happen, so it still makes the save, so it's

3432
04:22:08,325 --> 04:22:17,925
still half, but it has one left. Okay, so it takes
18 points of necrotic damage. That's the end of

3433
04:22:17,925 --> 04:22:27,268
that turn. It is now Yenk's turn. Yenk is going to
do a full-on multiattack against you, Grog. That

3434
04:22:27,268 --> 04:22:29,803
is a 24 to hit?

3435
04:22:29,803 --> 04:22:31,220
TRAVIS: That'll hit.

3436
04:22:31,220 --> 04:22:35,408
MATT: Actually, it has advantage on you because
you used reckless attack. That hits. Second one is

3437
04:22:35,408 --> 04:22:40,526
26 to hit.

3438
04:22:40,526 --> 04:22:41,838
TRAVIS: Hits.

3439
04:22:41,838 --> 04:22:44,398
MATT: And natural 20. All right.

3440
04:22:44,398 --> 04:22:48,868
TRAVIS: I'm going to use my Stone's Endurance on
the natural 20, and I'll do retaliation on one of

3441
04:22:48,868 --> 04:22:50,031
those three hits.

3442
04:22:50,031 --> 04:22:53,130
SAM: Retaliation? That's new.

3443
04:22:53,130 --> 04:23:12,813
MATT: So the first fist is 29 points of piercing
damage, so reduce that to 14, plus three points of

3444
04:23:12,813 --> 04:23:19,223
fire damage as the fist suddenly bursts into flame
as it slams into you. The secondary fist comes

3445
04:23:19,223 --> 04:23:28,220
swinging around the other way, dealing 20 points
of piercing damage, reduced to ten. Plus, you take

3446
04:23:28,220 --> 04:23:34,193
eight points of lightning damage as suddenly an
arc of energy streaks from the fist, slamming into

3447
04:23:34,193 --> 04:23:39,498
the other side of your face, as you're taking it
on each side. As you grin, he leaps up into the

3448
04:23:39,498 --> 04:23:45,622
air, his strong, thick legs getting almost up
above you, then kicks down with its hooves towards

3449
04:23:45,622 --> 04:23:49,759
you like a very angry goat. This is the critical.

3450
04:23:49,759 --> 04:23:52,745
LAURA: What does stone's endurance do?

3451
04:23:52,745 --> 04:23:55,143
TRAVIS: d12 plus my constitution modifier.

3452
04:23:55,143 --> 04:23:56,857
MATT: Reduce the damage, yeah.

3453
04:23:56,857 --> 04:24:02,837
TALIESIN: I've been hit by a goat in the face
before. No, really. I got nailed by a goat.

3454
04:24:02,837 --> 04:24:04,834
LIAM: At the zoo?

3455
04:24:04,834 --> 04:24:10,481
TALIESIN: No, we were filming this ridiculous
television series called Hell Town when I was a

3456
04:24:10,481 --> 04:24:11,811
kid. It was awful.

3457
04:24:11,811 --> 04:24:13,170
LIAM: You weren't trying to call Satan?

3458
04:24:13,170 --> 04:24:14,892
TALIESIN: Not in the show, either.

3459
04:24:14,892 --> 04:24:26,199
MATT: 46 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to
23, plus ten points of ice damage as the hooves

3460
04:24:26,199 --> 04:24:31,422
slam into you, leaving these frozen cracks where
the blood should be emanating from. It seals the

3461
04:24:31,422 --> 04:24:32,597
wound, almost.

3462
04:24:32,597 --> 04:24:39,529
TRAVIS: 14, so I reduce that by 14.

3463
04:24:39,529 --> 04:24:42,422
MATT: Correct, reduce that by 14, and then make
your retaliatory strike.

3464
04:24:42,422 --> 04:24:45,708
TRAVIS: Great weapon master, reckless.

3465
04:24:45,708 --> 04:24:47,584
MATT: Go for it.

3466
04:24:47,584 --> 04:24:52,271
TRAVIS: 26?

3467
04:24:52,271 --> 04:24:54,035
MATT: That hits.

3468
04:24:54,035 --> 04:25:04,138
TRAVIS: 22.

3469
04:25:04,138 --> 04:25:05,483
LAURA: Plus ten.

3470
04:25:05,483 --> 04:25:09,362
TRAVIS: 32.

3471
04:25:09,362 --> 04:25:11,343
MATT: 32 points of damage. How do you want to do
this?

3472
04:25:11,343 --> 04:25:13,082
(cheering)

3473
04:25:13,082 --> 04:25:16,187
MARISHA: Yeah, Grog! Get me that staff!

3474
04:25:16,187 --> 04:25:21,744
TRAVIS: When he jumped up and did the hoof kick
down, I'm going to take it and then grab his

3475
04:25:21,744 --> 04:25:25,328
hooves and wishbone him.

3476
04:25:25,328 --> 04:25:27,897
(cheering)

3477
04:25:27,897 --> 04:25:35,888
MATT: As you grab him, you try to begin to pull,
and he slams onto the ground, and you see him grab

3478
04:25:35,888 --> 04:25:40,430
his arms back to try and pull himself back up. You
kick him straight down again, and as you laugh,

3479
04:25:40,430 --> 04:25:45,776
you push your foot into his crotch area as you
pull Yenk in half with a sheer show of strength,

3480
04:25:45,776 --> 04:25:53,974
smearing you with black, burning blood. It does
burn you. You do suffer five points of fire damage

3481
04:25:53,974 --> 04:25:59,295
as the blood that's spurting on you is burning
into the skin. You tear him mostly in half. You

3482
04:25:59,295 --> 04:26:04,083
can see the innards spilling into the snow and
melting the snow within a five-foot radius of you

3483
04:26:04,083 --> 04:26:10,215
as he (death rattle) is still surviving as you
pull him apart. As you get closer, he reaches

3484
04:26:10,215 --> 04:26:14,259
forward and grabs you and palms your head with his
last bit of strength and begins to squeeze, and

3485
04:26:14,259 --> 04:26:19,426
then the fingers eventually go lax before the hand
(impact) onto the ground.

3486
04:26:19,426 --> 04:26:23,237
TRAVIS: I look at both of the legs in my hands,
and I look at Kima and go, which one's lucky?

3487
04:26:23,237 --> 04:26:26,570
MATT: She goes, "You are."

3488
04:26:26,570 --> 04:26:28,323
(laughter)

3489
04:26:28,323 --> 04:26:33,765
MATT: That ends Yenk's turn.

3490
04:26:33,765 --> 04:26:40,725
SAM: Hey, Matt. Can I rewind?

3491
04:26:40,725 --> 04:26:46,530
MATT: No. Sorry. Yenk is done and torn open on the
ground.

3492
04:26:46,530 --> 04:26:52,067
MARISHA: Now we have to deal with the two
dragons.

3493
04:26:52,067 --> 04:26:53,969
LAURA: Well, one. Hopefully.

3494
04:26:53,969 --> 04:27:00,871
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're going to let one leave.
One's going to walk.

3495
04:27:00,871 --> 04:27:09,440
MATT: Vorugal is going to go ahead and (whoosh)
come up and then--

3496
04:27:09,440 --> 04:27:12,125
SAM: Does Pike get an attack of opportunity?

3497
04:27:12,125 --> 04:27:16,678
MATT: Pike is not currently threatening him. Yeah,
with Raishan blasting and seeing the dragon,

3498
04:27:16,678 --> 04:27:29,404
Vorugal is going to turn this way, behind this
space underneath the air elemental. "You

3499
04:27:29,404 --> 04:27:44,900
"betrayer!" (roars) And unleash a blast of frozen
death down, hitting Raishan, as well as Vax and Pike.

3500
04:27:44,900 --> 04:27:52,292
You're unconscious. Vax, you fail a death saving
throw automatically.

3501
04:27:52,292 --> 04:27:54,239
MARISHA: I thought Pike had one hit point.

3502
04:27:54,239 --> 04:27:58,897
MATT: RIght. If you make the save, you're still
taking 30-something cold damage, so you're down.

3503
04:27:58,897 --> 04:28:15,474
Automatic one fail on a death saving throw.
Raishan does not make the save and takes 72 points

3504
04:28:15,474 --> 04:28:29,509
of ice damage. Yeah, that's going to end Vorugal's
turn, very angrily. All right, that brings us to Grog.

3505
04:28:29,509 --> 04:28:36,604
TRAVIS: Yeah. Can I make a quick look down? Do I
see any Spire of Conflux?

3506
04:28:36,604 --> 04:28:38,567
MATT: Make a quick investigation check.

3507
04:28:38,567 --> 04:28:42,612
TRAVIS: In my rage? Natural one. I'm going to take
off running toward Vorugal!

3508
04:28:42,612 --> 04:28:49,240
MATT: That's as far as you can get on your full
movement.

3509
04:28:49,240 --> 04:28:52,522
TRAVIS: I'll dash to get as far as I can.

3510
04:28:52,522 --> 04:28:58,297
MATT: Yeah, you can get about there. All right,
that ends Grog's turn. Scanlan, you're up.

3511
04:28:58,297 --> 04:29:09,256
SAM: I will bonus action take my potion of greater
healing, right? That's the medium one?

3512
04:29:09,256 --> 04:29:11,148
MATT: Yeah. It's 4d4 plus four.

3513
04:29:11,148 --> 04:29:24,447
SAM: Okay. Terrible. Okay. Oh man, that's
terrible.

3514
04:29:24,447 --> 04:29:26,051
LAURA: What did you get?

3515
04:29:26,051 --> 04:29:27,665
SAM: 11 total.

3516
04:29:27,665 --> 04:29:29,624
TRAVIS: From which potion?

3517
04:29:29,624 --> 04:29:31,081
LAURA: Greater.

3518
04:29:31,081 --> 04:29:41,286
SAM: Okay. Well, shit. I'll move towards the
dragon a bit.

3519
04:29:41,286 --> 04:30:01,376
MATT: Actually, Percy, make a concentration check,
if you could. Make a constitution saving throw for

3520
04:30:01,376 --> 04:30:03,702
Hex, yeah. Forgot about that.

3521
04:30:03,702 --> 04:30:14,344
TALIESIN: Constitution saving? That would be a
negative one? No, not a negative one. Add negative

3522
04:30:14,344 --> 04:30:21,286
one. That would be 15.

3523
04:30:21,286 --> 04:30:28,995
MATT: 15. For you to take half damage? Yeah. Hex
stays. All right. Scanlan?

3524
04:30:28,995 --> 04:30:40,975
SAM: There are no options. Not to save our
friends! I'm way out of range.

3525
04:30:40,975 --> 04:30:44,710
LAURA: Can you Dimension Door and then run with
her?

3526
04:30:44,710 --> 04:30:55,834
SAM: I'm done. I've moved. I've acted. I can throw
a ball. I'll throw a Fireball at Big Whitey.

3527
04:30:55,834 --> 04:31:02,882
Centered way back so it doesn't hit any of my
friends.

3528
04:31:02,882 --> 04:31:04,704
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

3529
04:31:04,704 --> 04:31:10,246
SAM: Three charges, I guess. What do I do? I just
do it.

3530
04:31:10,246 --> 04:31:12,828
MATT: That's a natural 20 on his save, so he does
make his save.

3531
04:31:12,828 --> 04:31:18,953
SAM: What I was going to say, I rewind. Because
you didn't let me, he has disadvantage on his save

3532
04:31:18,953 --> 04:31:21,894
this time, because you didn't let me retroactively
go back and do it.

3533
04:31:21,894 --> 04:31:28,430
MATT: That's right. Natural one. 20, one.

3534
04:31:28,430 --> 04:31:29,898
TRAVIS: Are you kidding me?

3535
04:31:29,898 --> 04:31:31,497
MARISHA: Burn this motherfucker!

3536
04:31:31,497 --> 04:31:33,196
TRAVIS: Every time we have one of these big
fights--

3537
04:31:33,196 --> 04:31:36,668
TALIESIN: There's no middle ground, is there?
There's no middle ground at all.

3538
04:31:36,668 --> 04:31:39,296
MATT: To be fair, we do a lot of rolls in these
big fights.

3539
04:31:39,296 --> 04:31:42,848
TRAVIS: We do, but a straight 20 to one flip-flop
only happens one time.

3540
04:31:42,848 --> 04:31:51,607
SAM: 29.

3541
04:31:51,607 --> 04:31:54,838
MARISHA: That's pretty good. That's okay.

3542
04:31:54,838 --> 04:32:00,496
MATT: (explosion) The explosion hits. You see it
sends ice shards shooting everywhere, leaving a

3543
04:32:00,496 --> 04:32:06,163
big crater on the ground where the snow once was,
and part of the stonework is barely scratched. The

3544
04:32:06,163 --> 04:32:15,850
blast hits Vorugal, and Vorugal (grunts). Looks
down at the two unconscious bodies on the ground.

3545
04:32:15,850 --> 04:32:23,972
Looks up at Raishan. (huffs) Does that end your
turn?

3546
04:32:23,972 --> 04:32:26,001
SAM: Yes.

3547
04:32:26,001 --> 04:32:32,433
MATT: End of your turn, it's going to use two
actions to do a wing attack, beating its wings,

3548
04:32:32,433 --> 04:32:43,451
hitting every creature within 15 feet. You're out
of range, actually, Marisha. Grog, I need you to

3549
04:32:43,451 --> 04:32:45,348
make a dexterity saving throw.

3550
04:32:45,348 --> 04:32:58,340
TRAVIS: I think I have advantage on this because
of rage. I do. 21.

3551
04:32:58,340 --> 04:33:03,484
MATT: 21? That unfortunately fails. You take 15
points of bludgeoning damage, and you're knocked

3552
04:33:03,484 --> 04:33:12,538
prone. Also, Pike and Vax, you both fail a death
saving throw from the bludgeoning winds of the ice

3553
04:33:12,538 --> 04:33:15,895
dragon's wings beating downward.

3554
04:33:15,895 --> 04:33:18,266
MARISHA: You guys are at two failed?

3555
04:33:18,266 --> 04:33:20,485
LAURA: He's at two failed. Pike's at one.

3556
04:33:20,485 --> 04:33:30,220
MATT: Vorugal is going to head upward and begin
flying this direction to turn tail and flee.

3557
04:33:30,220 --> 04:33:34,949
SAM: Do you get an attack because he's flying by
you?

3558
04:33:34,949 --> 04:33:36,932
MARISHA: Yeah, do I get an attack of opportunity
here?

3559
04:33:36,932 --> 04:33:38,546
SAM: You are right over him.

3560
04:33:38,546 --> 04:33:44,274
MATT: You were right over him. As he gets up, I'll
give you one. I don't have any more of these

3561
04:33:44,274 --> 04:33:45,879
things here.

3562
04:33:45,879 --> 04:33:51,062
LIAM: Blow everything you've got. Blow it. He's
leaving. Unleash.

3563
04:33:51,062 --> 04:33:55,350
MARISHA: Can I do a spell attack on him? It's just
melee, right?

3564
04:33:55,350 --> 04:33:58,046
MATT: That's specifically a War Caster feat
ability.

3565
04:33:58,046 --> 04:34:09,930
MARISHA: Just one slam attack? Nope. Definitely
not.

3566
04:34:09,930 --> 04:34:12,800
TALIESIN: How fast? Is he still within visual
range?

3567
04:34:12,800 --> 04:34:17,063
MATT: Currently, yeah. He just moved 40 feet with
that one reaction.

3568
04:34:17,063 --> 04:34:19,800
LAURA: We can still hit him with the ranged?

3569
04:34:19,800 --> 04:34:26,281
MATT: Possibly, yeah. That ends Scanlan's turn.
Vax, I need you make a death saving throw. You

3570
04:34:26,281 --> 04:34:28,133
have advantage.

3571
04:34:28,133 --> 04:34:31,164
SAM: Advantage?

3572
04:34:31,164 --> 04:34:32,564
LIAM: 17.

3573
04:34:32,564 --> 04:34:39,249
MATT: So you're okay for now. Vex, you're up.

3574
04:34:39,249 --> 04:34:43,859
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to hit him twice.

3575
04:34:43,859 --> 04:34:46,128
MARISHA: Fucking burn this guy down!

3576
04:34:46,128 --> 04:34:49,549
TALIESIN: Hit him with everything we've got.

3577
04:34:49,549 --> 04:34:52,235
LAURA: 27.

3578
04:34:52,235 --> 04:34:54,100
MATT: 27 hits.

3579
04:34:54,100 --> 04:35:08,465
LAURA: 25 on the first.

3580
04:35:08,465 --> 04:35:12,487
MATT: 25 damage? All right, and the second hit?

3581
04:35:12,487 --> 04:35:17,957
LAURA: The second is also 27.

3582
04:35:17,957 --> 04:35:19,995
MATT: How do you want to do this?

3583
04:35:19,995 --> 04:35:24,597
(cheering)

3584
04:35:24,597 --> 04:35:27,382
MARISHA: We're going to live!

3585
04:35:27,382 --> 04:35:29,304
LAURA: Oh my god.

3586
04:35:29,304 --> 04:35:36,780
MATT: He's taking away, and you have a shot as
it's arcing to the right of you, bleeding and

3587
04:35:36,780 --> 04:35:41,526
limping in the air, but managing to pick up speed.
The sleet and snow is strong and firing around you.

3588
04:35:41,526 --> 04:35:46,488
LAURA: I want to see a cut on his stomach where
Yenk left a hole, and I want to go straight into

3589
04:35:46,488 --> 04:35:47,840
his heart.

3590
04:35:47,840 --> 04:35:52,600
MATT: The first arrow, you aim for it. It streaks
off and hits another wound and gets jammed in. You

3591
04:35:52,600 --> 04:35:57,002
pull back with the second arrow, and right as you
see the snow beginning to blind, the one moment of

3592
04:35:57,002 --> 04:36:05,528
clarity that hits you, (arrow firing) you release
the arrow, piercing inside where the wound was,

3593
04:36:05,528 --> 04:36:11,656
where one of Yenk's horns had gashed into the
front of his chest. Vorugal (roars) and spins into

3594
04:36:11,656 --> 04:36:17,813
a corkscrew, plummets and crashes into the side of
the ravine, tumbles backward. Rocks come tumbling

3595
04:36:17,813 --> 04:36:24,829
onto it. Vorugal hits the ground, smacked open. As
it begins to get back up, (impacts) a bunch of

3596
04:36:24,829 --> 04:36:29,334
rocks slam down, and one big shard of ice
(impacts) slams into it. (panting) Still writhing

3597
04:36:29,334 --> 04:36:31,239
in place as he's bleeding out.

3598
04:36:31,239 --> 04:36:34,009
LAURA: And a tree grows out of his guts.

3599
04:36:34,009 --> 04:36:41,401
MATT: He's still currently holding on as he's
jammed to the ground. You see the bluish-purple

3600
04:36:41,401 --> 04:36:50,036
blood leaking out the side of the mouth. (panting)
It can't move, and you can see the strength

3601
04:36:50,036 --> 04:37:00,700
leaving Vorugal's body. Raishan swoops up next to
Vorugal's corpse, leaning over. (cackles) "Tell

3602
04:37:00,700 --> 04:37:15,489
"your master on the other side, when you see him,
that it was worth it." And Raishan sinks her teeth

3603
04:37:15,489 --> 04:37:20,580
into his throat and tears it out. You see the
spray of blood across Raishan's mouth and across

3604
04:37:20,580 --> 04:37:27,904
the front of the ravine as Vorugal's body falls
limp onto the ground. Spits the chunk of white

3605
04:37:27,904 --> 04:37:36,624
dragon flesh onto the bottom of the ravine. The
green dragon spins around, facing you all. "Well

3606
04:37:36,624 --> 04:37:48,195
"done." And backs into a sitting position. The
wings furl down and fold into her side. "Take your

3607
04:37:48,195 --> 04:37:55,761
"spoils. It seems the war is nigh."

3608
04:37:55,761 --> 04:38:00,284
TALIESIN: There will be a conversation.

3609
04:38:00,284 --> 04:38:03,780
TRAVIS: I run as fast as I can over to Pike and
Vax.

3610
04:38:03,780 --> 04:38:09,155
TALIESIN: I run to the body of the big demonic
thing and start going through it.

3611
04:38:09,155 --> 04:38:11,150
MATT: Okay, roll an investigation check.

3612
04:38:11,150 --> 04:38:16,335
TRAVIS: I have two basic potions. I de-cork both
of them and shove them in their gullets.

3613
04:38:16,335 --> 04:38:20,805
MATT: While that's happening, in the time it takes
you guys to rush over, I need you both to make one

3614
04:38:20,805 --> 04:38:22,183
more death saving throw.

3615
04:38:22,183 --> 04:38:27,061
MARISHA: Oh, fuck. Come on, you guys.

3616
04:38:27,061 --> 04:38:30,031
LIAM: A ten and a three!

3617
04:38:30,031 --> 04:38:33,129
(laughter)

3618
04:38:33,129 --> 04:38:36,557
TALIESIN: Not funny!

3619
04:38:36,557 --> 04:38:40,545
ASHLEY: 11.

3620
04:38:40,545 --> 04:38:46,487
MATT: Grog comes by, scoops you both up, and
force-feeds you two basic healing potions. You

3621
04:38:46,487 --> 04:38:54,627
both come to consciousness bruised, beaten, but
apparently the current struggle is done, though

3622
04:38:54,627 --> 04:39:00,242
you're now shivering, cold, soaked through. All of
you, the elements have really sunk in once the

3623
04:39:00,242 --> 04:39:02,384
adrenaline begins to wear off.

3624
04:39:02,384 --> 04:39:05,253
LAURA: I fly down and cast Cure Wounds on Vax.

3625
04:39:05,253 --> 04:39:09,912
TRAVIS: The two of you, inside the mansion. Now.

3626
04:39:09,912 --> 04:39:13,255
MATT: How much do your potions heal for them? It's
1d4 plus four. Sorry, 2d4 plus two.

3627
04:39:13,255 --> 04:39:14,943
MARISHA: Yes, we do.

3628
04:39:14,943 --> 04:39:17,161
TALIESIN: Vex, we have a dragon to disassemble.

3629
04:39:17,161 --> 04:39:21,081
MARISHA: You go. I'm the one who's good at
harvesting.

3630
04:39:21,081 --> 04:39:22,363
TRAVIS: Six.

3631
04:39:22,363 --> 04:39:24,653
MATT: Plus two, eight. You heal eight, Vax.

3632
04:39:24,653 --> 04:39:26,301
TRAVIS: Eight.

3633
04:39:26,301 --> 04:39:30,261
LAURA: Get inside, now.

3634
04:39:30,261 --> 04:39:32,836
MATT: So seven to Pike.

3635
04:39:32,836 --> 04:39:37,009
LAURA: I'm going to fly over and try to help
Percy, now that they're safe.

3636
04:39:37,009 --> 04:39:39,247
TALIESIN: I got a 16.

3637
04:39:39,247 --> 04:39:40,722
MATT: 16, you healed?

3638
04:39:40,722 --> 04:39:42,497
TALIESIN: No, 16 to investigate.

3639
04:39:42,497 --> 04:39:48,333
MATT: As you start peering through, you can see
there's an intestinal tract that's covered in

3640
04:39:48,333 --> 04:39:52,907
thorns. It's a very weird, fucked-up alien
creature, based on any sort of anatomic

3641
04:39:52,907 --> 04:40:01,345
understanding. As you pull back, you can find
there's one rigid portion of the inside of its

3642
04:40:01,345 --> 04:40:09,390
intestinal tract that is swollen and looks to have
this weird black, pulsing mass that surrounds it,

3643
04:40:09,390 --> 04:40:11,195
like it's infected perpetually.

3644
04:40:11,195 --> 04:40:13,008
TALIESIN: I pull out my sword and cut it out.

3645
04:40:13,008 --> 04:40:19,032
MATT: As you pull it back, you can see there are
actual vines and ivy that have begun to grow

3646
04:40:19,032 --> 04:40:26,728
inside its abdomen. You tear back and pull it, and
as soon as you cut back the rest of the muscle

3647
04:40:26,728 --> 04:40:31,296
that's currently tensing it in, the muscle almost
instinctually pulls back, all the tension lost,

3648
04:40:31,296 --> 04:40:37,237
and it almost fires this staff-like entity out. It
shoots outward, and you have to dodge to the side

3649
04:40:37,237 --> 04:40:45,563
immediately. You see that it's strangely pristine
amongst all the crimson and gore. The blood of

3650
04:40:45,563 --> 04:40:52,495
this creature does not even touch its surface. A
twisted series of clumped-together thorny vines

3651
04:40:52,495 --> 04:41:00,076
that form this curvature at the top. A singular
yellowish-green gem in the center that hovers,

3652
04:41:00,076 --> 04:41:07,673
locked in place by no noticeable force. It's
there, jutting out of the body of the creature.

3653
04:41:07,673 --> 04:41:09,318
MARISHA: I run to Percy.

3654
04:41:09,318 --> 04:41:14,672
TALIESIN: I walk to you. We're walking to the
dragon, anyway. I hand it to you. Your majesty.

3655
04:41:14,672 --> 04:41:23,952
LAURA: I land next to them. Oh my god. Let's get
inside.

3656
04:41:23,952 --> 04:41:26,150
(offscreen clatter)

3657
04:41:26,150 --> 04:41:28,007
MARISHA: That's right!

3658
04:41:28,007 --> 04:41:29,607
TALIESIN: Karma's a bitch!

3659
04:41:29,607 --> 04:41:32,041
LIAM: Vorugal ain't shit!

3660
04:41:32,041 --> 04:41:34,810
MATT: You all rush into the inside of the
mansion?

3661
04:41:34,810 --> 04:41:36,943
MARISHA: I don't, immediately.

3662
04:41:36,943 --> 04:41:42,239
TALIESIN: We're finishing up the harvesting, and
I go to talk to Raishan really quickly.

3663
04:41:42,239 --> 04:41:45,500
LAURA: I stay out, and I search more around Yenk.

3664
04:41:45,500 --> 04:41:47,281
TALIESIN: I'm sending you to work on the dragon.

3665
04:41:47,281 --> 04:41:49,234
MARISHA: I'm coming with you to have that
conversation.

3666
04:41:49,234 --> 04:41:50,675
TALIESIN: Okay.

3667
04:41:50,675 --> 04:41:52,756
MARISHA: I'm coming with you to have that
conversation.

3668
04:41:52,756 --> 04:41:58,508
SAM: I will come, as well, to make sure Keyleth
doesn't kill anyone.

3669
04:41:58,508 --> 04:42:04,652
TALIESIN: Thank you. You've earned a conversation.
We'll see you at home. You should get there

3670
04:42:04,652 --> 04:42:06,752
quickly so there's no suspicion.

3671
04:42:06,752 --> 04:42:08,001
SAM: What's home?

3672
04:42:08,001 --> 04:42:09,679
TALIESIN: We don't say it.

3673
04:42:09,679 --> 04:42:20,420
MATT: "Very well. I hope that perhaps this display
of intent has quelled some of your worries. I'll

3674
04:42:20,420 --> 04:42:28,311
"see you at home, then." The form shifts down to
that of Asum, closes the eyes for a second, and

3675
04:42:28,311 --> 04:42:34,380
the form shifts as you see a sudden glyph appear
beneath, and vanishes.

3676
04:42:34,380 --> 04:42:37,286
TALIESIN: That was not a fight we were about to
have.

3677
04:42:37,286 --> 04:42:45,632
MARISHA: (sighs heavily) I silently go and start
harvesting the white dragon.

3678
04:42:45,632 --> 04:42:47,962
LAURA: Did you see how weak she was, compared
to Vorugal?

3679
04:42:47,962 --> 04:42:57,369
MARISHA: Let's just hope she stays that way. I
start harvesting the white dragon as much as I can.

3680
04:42:57,369 --> 04:42:59,383
LIAM: I'm going to find Larkin.

3681
04:42:59,383 --> 04:43:03,538
SAM: Send up a signal flare.

3682
04:43:03,538 --> 04:43:10,193
LAURA: I take an empty potion bottle out and get
some of Yenk's blood and put it in the cold.

3683
04:43:10,193 --> 04:43:19,943
MATT: Okay. As you're doing that, too, you're
noticing that Yenk's body is rapidly decomposing.

3684
04:43:19,943 --> 04:43:23,435
Its form is dissolving from the inside.

3685
04:43:23,435 --> 04:43:26,288
MARISHA: I try as fast as I can-- wait, from who?

3686
04:43:26,288 --> 04:43:29,810
TALIESIN: I'm going to run over and try and pull
anything from Yenk.

3687
04:43:29,810 --> 04:43:35,543
MATT: I figure, for the fact that it's near
midnight, we can begin next game working out the

3688
04:43:35,543 --> 04:43:41,602
logistics of what you've managed to harvest with the rolls
and such. We'll pick up from here next time. That

3689
04:43:41,602 --> 04:43:44,989
was intense, guys. Well done.

3690
04:43:44,989 --> 04:43:46,414
MARISHA: Oh my god!

3691
04:43:46,414 --> 04:43:48,136
SAM: Perfectly executed plan.

3692
04:43:48,136 --> 04:43:52,210
TALIESIN: It really was. It actually was. How was
this terrible?

3693
04:43:52,210 --> 04:43:56,210
TRAVIS: That couldn't have gone any worse in the
beginning. They hit each other maybe once, and

3694
04:43:56,210 --> 04:43:59,231
then it was all on!

3695
04:43:59,231 --> 04:44:03,774
MATT: Actually, they did some pretty decent-- I
think Yenk did close to 100 points of damage

3696
04:44:03,774 --> 04:44:06,101
before you guys even engaged Vorugal.

3697
04:44:06,101 --> 04:44:11,432
MARISHA: Can I see it?

3698
04:44:11,432 --> 04:44:13,614
MATT: (laughing) Can you see it?

3699
04:44:13,614 --> 04:44:15,481
MARISHA: I really don't want to wait a week.

3700
04:44:15,481 --> 04:44:23,194
MATT: Sure. You can go ahead and have a look at
your Spire of Conflux. You earned it.

3701
04:44:23,194 --> 04:44:25,545
TALIESIN: Good work, girl.

3702
04:44:25,545 --> 04:44:28,090
MARISHA: I didn't think I was going to get one,
you guys!

3703
04:44:28,090 --> 04:44:42,398
MATT: Well, guys. Well done. You've now taken
three of the five Chroma Conclave dragons, and

3704
04:44:42,398 --> 04:44:50,933
with the death of Vorugal, pretty much are
spearheading the final push to Thordak.

3705
04:44:50,933 --> 04:44:53,113
LIAM: Is Thordak scared yet?

3706
04:44:53,113 --> 04:45:00,222
MATT: We'll find out. (chuckles) Well, guys. Thank
you so much. Have a wonderful night. Thank you for

3707
04:45:00,222 --> 04:45:03,718
those who stuck around for as late as this epic
battle went. I hope you enjoyed it as much as we did.

3708
04:45:03,718 --> 04:45:05,610
TRAVIS: Glad Pike was here for the fight!

3709
04:45:05,610 --> 04:45:09,113
(cheering)

3710
04:45:09,113 --> 04:45:10,661
MARISHA: Sarenrae!

3711
04:45:10,661 --> 04:45:16,122
MATT: Divine Intervention! Punched Vorugal into
the dirt, man.

3712
04:45:16,122 --> 04:45:19,690
LAURA: Thank you, Loot Crate.

3713
04:45:19,690 --> 04:45:22,989
MATT: Thank you, Loot Crate for being awesome
sponsors. Thank you, Critters for being such

3714
04:45:22,989 --> 04:45:28,086
amazing people and for being so supportive of the
community and the show and the story and making

3715
04:45:28,086 --> 04:45:34,226
your own stories. We're so happy and so proud to
have you with us. Be sure to check out the many

3716
04:45:34,226 --> 04:45:38,992

of our individual charities. You can look up the

3717
04:45:38,992 --> 04:45:43,771
Critter's Guide to Critmas and see the list of
them there. Thank you so much. Have a wonderful

3718
04:45:43,771 --> 04:45:47,665
night, and is it Thursday yet? See you guys next
week.

3719
04:45:47,665 --> 04:52:26,011
