00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,435
MATT: Hello and good evening, everyone. Welcome to
tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch

2
00:00:04,479 --> 00:00:08,870
of us voice-actors get together and play Dungeons
and Dragons-- crazy, fun, nerdy times.

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,754
So we are unfortunately missing Travis Willingham
again this evening, because he's a pussy and had

4
00:00:13,754 --> 00:00:19,567
to go see Avengers tonight, so feel free to let
him know on Twitter. But anyway, we have a really

5
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:25,152
fun, action-packed adventure-- as if last week's
wasn't tension enough. Let's see how the rest of

6
00:00:25,152 --> 00:00:29,116
the group manages to recover from their climactic
battle at the top of Emberhold.

7
00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:32,594
But in the meantime, let's go ahead and give you
an intro and some of the character backgrounds

8
00:00:32,594 --> 00:00:34,310
before we come back.

9
00:00:35,401 --> 00:01:39,457
[dramatic music]

10
00:01:43,584 --> 00:01:48,392
ASHLEY: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town,
near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family

11
00:01:48,392 --> 00:01:54,197
of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable
reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery

12
00:01:54,197 --> 00:02:00,425
left them with the curse of the last name
Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and

13
00:02:00,425 --> 00:02:05,514
redemption, had other plans for Pike's
great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his

14
00:02:05,657 --> 00:02:11,513
family at a young age after a dream: a dream that
changed the course of the Trickfoot family.

15
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,102
Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged
from then on that him and his family would live a

16
00:02:17,102 --> 00:02:19,654
life of service and devotion.

17
00:02:20,435 --> 00:02:26,693
As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to
heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even

18
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:32,793
flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making
things whole that had once been broken. She

19
00:02:32,793 --> 00:02:36,330
studied and learned the ways to heal though divine
magic.

20
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,954
She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until
one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by

21
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:48,169
a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths
took a stand against the murder of the innocent

22
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:55,606
gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and
left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went

23
00:02:55,606 --> 00:03:00,217
to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this
barbarian as best she could,

24
00:03:00,217 --> 00:03:03,339
bringing him back to life.

25
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:10,671
When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog
Strongjaw. After that, they were best of friends,

26
00:03:10,671 --> 00:03:17,397
a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that
in a few years' time, Grog would soon return the

27
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:24,478
favor and bring her back from the clutches of
death. (roar, crunch)

28
00:03:24,478 --> 00:03:29,454
After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She
wanted to be stronger so that it would never

29
00:03:29,454 --> 00:03:34,733
happen again. She spent four months at sea
training with the men and women aboard a ship

30
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:37,636
called the Broken Howl.

31
00:03:37,636 --> 00:03:42,838
Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her
morningstar in the other, this time,

32
00:03:42,838 --> 00:03:45,218
Pike is ready.

33
00:03:46,614 --> 00:03:54,801
TRAVIS: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then
you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of

34
00:03:54,801 --> 00:04:02,352
towering height and size, this barbarian has an
appetite for the two great loves in his life:

35
00:04:02,352 --> 00:04:06,513
combat, women, and ale! (chuckle)

36
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,431
(record scratch) Wait.

37
00:04:08,431 --> 00:04:15,027
Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often
consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes,

38
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:18,385
colors, and (chuckle) shiny things!

39
00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:20,222
Also ale.

40
00:04:20,222 --> 00:04:26,103
In his early years, armed with his two-handed
great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might

41
00:04:26,103 --> 00:04:32,652
amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd.
But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly

42
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:40,789
gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of
such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog

43
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:46,437
felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified
little thing.

44
00:04:46,437 --> 00:04:50,096
And his disobedience cost him dearly.

45
00:04:50,096 --> 00:04:57,753
Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his
uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die,

46
00:04:57,753 --> 00:05:04,595
exiled from his herd. It was then that the
relative of the very gnome he fought to save,

47
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:12,648
saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric
named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back

48
00:05:12,648 --> 00:05:18,229
from death's edge. And they have remained close
friends ever since.

49
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:25,261
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire
taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying

50
00:05:25,261 --> 00:05:31,408
Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for
lady favors.

51
00:05:31,408 --> 00:05:33,075
Also ale!

52
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:38,260
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth would leave
you with little information on the half-elven

53
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:43,081
druid. You might even think that her social
awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is

54
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:45,425
kind of sweet. (chuckle)

55
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:51,920
Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her
based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that

56
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,724
unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast
waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have

57
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:03,660
made even the fiercest of champions pee their
pants, literally! (soft chuckle)

58
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,863
Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people,
Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and

59
00:06:08,863 --> 00:06:14,935
the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent
duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

60
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:19,771
where the four elemental planes begin to bleed
with this realm.

61
00:06:19,771 --> 00:06:25,110
Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack
for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities.

62
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:32,224
Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels
to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat)

63
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:37,997
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of
the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true

64
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:43,473
prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to
succeed him as the next headmaster.

65
00:06:43,473 --> 00:06:49,510
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped
and replaced with endless spell memorization,

66
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:55,337
teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly
high expectations. Every druid leader to be must

67
00:06:55,337 --> 00:07:00,930
embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in
order to introduce and establish respect amongst

68
00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:07,714
the fellow headmasters. They call this the
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt

69
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:13,946
she was ready, he set her on the path to truly
discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she

70
00:07:13,946 --> 00:07:15,786
will ever return.

71
00:07:15,786 --> 00:07:20,940
As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben,
she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the

72
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:27,631
Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a
valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate

73
00:07:27,631 --> 00:07:35,877
leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on
repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?

74
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:43,076
TALIESIN: Percy was the third of seven children,
born to a noble family who lived far to the north

75
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:48,905
in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many
siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy

76
00:07:48,905 --> 00:07:53,908
turned his attentions to the sciences,
engineering, and naturalism.

77
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:59,987
One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady
Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in

78
00:07:59,987 --> 00:08:05,921
their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control
of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who

79
00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:08,091
would stand in their way.

80
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:13,666
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be
freed by his younger sister. Together they fled,

81
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:19,628
chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran,
Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest

82
00:08:19,628 --> 00:08:26,097
and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping
into a freezing river and floating unconscious to

83
00:08:26,097 --> 00:08:31,616
freedom. He did not remember waking up on a
fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two

84
00:08:31,616 --> 00:08:36,204
years, as he slowly made his way as far south as
possible.

85
00:08:36,204 --> 00:08:42,760
Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud
of smoke offered him vengeance against those who

86
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:50,360
destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began
to design his first gun. (gunshot)

87
00:08:52,077 --> 00:08:57,414
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?
Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his

88
00:08:57,414 --> 00:08:58,837
eye on you.

89
00:08:58,837 --> 00:09:04,334
A talented musician, master of disguise, and
dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings

90
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:08,517
songs almost as much as he sings his own praises.

91
00:09:08,517 --> 00:09:14,151
Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm
and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and

92
00:09:14,151 --> 00:09:19,739
support his single mother. One day he was
discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr.

93
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:25,543
Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he
learned the ways of the world, and honed his

94
00:09:25,543 --> 00:09:28,905
skills as a bard extraordinaire.

95
00:09:28,905 --> 00:09:33,329
A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite
come to terms with the violent death of his mother

96
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:39,231
at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years
on the road provided many, shall we say,

97
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:45,375
educational experiences with the opposite sex,
deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's

98
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:49,874
never known: the true love of a fellow gnome.

99
00:09:49,874 --> 00:09:56,686
Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first,
performer second, and fighter distant third. On

100
00:09:56,686 --> 00:10:02,153
the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but
rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow

101
00:10:02,153 --> 00:10:03,931
gnome, Pike.

102
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:09,437
Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking
song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts

103
00:10:09,437 --> 00:10:12,286
and makes the females swoon.

104
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:21,002
ORION: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius
Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

105
00:10:21,002 --> 00:10:23,585
located in the heart of Draconia.

106
00:10:23,585 --> 00:10:29,023
From a politically respected family, at the age of
15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite,

107
00:10:29,023 --> 00:10:34,128
showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The
judges and the Draconian high council were amazed

108
00:10:34,128 --> 00:10:39,132
at how powerful my spells were for how long I had
been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest

109
00:10:39,132 --> 00:10:44,448
appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian
history. For the next few years, I almost went mad

110
00:10:44,448 --> 00:10:49,328
from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's
rather boring.

111
00:10:49,328 --> 00:10:54,973
However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused
for quite some time. In the room were stacks of

112
00:10:54,973 --> 00:10:59,912
books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas
around the known world. For months, I would

113
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:03,634
frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts
from legend.

114
00:11:03,634 --> 00:11:08,259
After a long period of research, I made a list of
artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these

115
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:12,787
findings to the high council and was told that all
of the information in the chamber I had stumbled

116
00:11:12,787 --> 00:11:19,106
upon was either believed to be fiction, or
unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever.

117
00:11:19,106 --> 00:11:21,951
I found those answers to be unacceptable.

118
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:26,350
A year later, I devised a ruse and managed to
convince the city council to lend support in me

119
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:31,205
leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and
diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from

120
00:11:31,205 --> 00:11:36,537
town to town and making friends and allies, in and
for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn,

121
00:11:36,537 --> 00:11:42,455
I had quite the task on my hands in that respect,
but it was exactly what I needed so I could

122
00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:47,464
explore the world and find these artifacts, as I
felt the truth was out there.

123
00:11:47,464 --> 00:11:53,077
Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say
poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most

124
00:11:53,077 --> 00:11:58,723
give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to
things sometimes. I've also been known to be

125
00:11:58,723 --> 00:12:06,425
rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well,
dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales

126
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:11,182
every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite
friendly for a dragonborn!

127
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:17,927
LIAM: Never entirely welcome in the company of
elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to

128
00:12:17,927 --> 00:12:23,457
skip past formality, preferring instead to invite
himself in your door.

129
00:12:23,457 --> 00:12:29,680
Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by
a chance encounter between elven royalty and human

130
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,264
peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early
years, the twins were eventually sent off to their

131
00:12:35,264 --> 00:12:40,945
father in the elven capital of Syngorn. But their
cool reception among the elves there never warmed,

132
00:12:40,945 --> 00:12:47,061
and their time in the capital didn't last. The
siblings stole away one autumn night and set out

133
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:49,262
on the open road.

134
00:12:49,262 --> 00:12:54,267
After a few years of wandering, they eventually
decided to return to their mother, and journeyed

135
00:12:54,267 --> 00:13:00,233
back to the lands of their youth. But instead of
finding their childhood home, they returned to a

136
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:06,727
pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home
burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for

137
00:13:06,727 --> 00:13:16,728
answers, they learned of the day the dragon came.
(roar) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and

138
00:13:16,728 --> 00:13:21,048
his sister set out to find their fortune together
in Tal'Dorei.

139
00:13:21,048 --> 00:13:27,922
An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to
solve life's challenges in his own particular way,

140
00:13:27,922 --> 00:13:34,270
often by side-stepping them entirely. And when his
knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough,

141
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:39,908
(knife scraping) the way of blades the elves
schooled him in more than makes up the

142
00:13:39,908 --> 00:13:41,401
difference.

143
00:13:42,202 --> 00:13:47,095
LAURA: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has
spent most of her life suffering the cool

144
00:13:47,095 --> 00:13:54,381
reception of a people who don't fully accept her.
Born of a human mother and an elven father who

145
00:13:54,381 --> 00:13:59,570
only later in life took an interest in their
existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother

146
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:04,182
Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they
could truly rely on

147
00:14:04,182 --> 00:14:07,836
in this world were each other.

148
00:14:07,836 --> 00:14:12,778
It was at the age of ten when the two were taken
from their mother and brought to live in Syngorn,

149
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:19,222
the isolated elven city for which their father was
an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always

150
00:14:19,222 --> 00:14:25,954
kept an icy distance, and after too many years of
disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his

151
00:14:25,954 --> 00:14:30,013
indifference behind, and set out on their own.

152
00:14:30,013 --> 00:14:37,802
Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets
and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept

153
00:14:37,802 --> 00:14:41,625
to the woods; she preferred the isolation.

154
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:48,639
Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and
to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a

155
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:55,462
series of fateful events, earned herself a
companion in the form of a bear-- her own stolen

156
00:14:55,462 --> 00:15:00,675
Trinket-- to fight alongside her and protect her
fiercely.

157
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:05,504
Also, he is adorable, and gives expert massages.

158
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:11,746
MATT: Hey guys, welcome back. While we are missing
Travis, it's totally fine, Avengers is a fantastic

159
00:15:11,746 --> 00:15:18,348
film. It's a wonderful film and hope he doesn't
spoil anything for us in his return, but he is

160
00:15:18,348 --> 00:15:21,489
missed. Travis, we miss you. We'll have you back
next week, hopefully.

161
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:25,320
ORION: I'm going to spoil the movie for everybody:
they win!

162
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:28,029
TALIESIN AND LAURA: But do they?

163
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:31,812
MATT: I don't know. It's Joss Whedon (laughs)

164
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:33,382
ORION: I didn't say who 'they' were.

165
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:38,341
MATT: Oh, that's true. All right, so, welcome
everyone. For those of you who's this the first

166
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:42,685
time, (laughs) buckle up for some interesting-- So
we're a bunch of voice actors who play Dungeons &

167
00:15:42,685 --> 00:15:46,808
Dragons and this is our campaign we've been
running for a while. To give you a little heads-up

168
00:15:46,808 --> 00:15:52,643
on the story so far, the party was hired to find
an individual named Lady Kima, and she is a

169
00:15:52,643 --> 00:15:57,294
halfling paladin. The platinum dragon Bahamut
is her deity

170
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,708
SAM: And we found her!

171
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,182
MATT: You did. I was going to get to that.

172
00:16:02,182 --> 00:16:03,897
(all laugh)

173
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:09,075
MATT: So they went seeking her in caverns beneath
the dwarven city of Kraghammer. After much

174
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:15,693
fighting and surviving, they manage to find their
way to a duergar fortress called Emberhold, where

175
00:16:15,693 --> 00:16:17,706
they found Lady Kima captive beneath.

176
00:16:17,706 --> 00:16:22,796
They released her and then, using her help,
assaulted the throne room at the top and managed

177
00:16:22,796 --> 00:16:31,554
to slay King Murghol of the duergar. However, in
the process, Grog, our intrepid barbarian, was

178
00:16:31,554 --> 00:16:36,505
kidnapped by the queen mage before she could be
slain, who then also disintegrated a portion of

179
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:41,944
the roof, letting an entire cavalcade of molten
rock into the fortress.

180
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:46,809
The party then had to make a heated escape.
However, a number of the party members, due to the

181
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:52,558
gaze of the two basilisks that were kept in the
throne room as pets, Lady Kima and our Tiberius

182
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:58,419
Stormwind, our dragonborn sorcerer, are currently
stone. Dragging them out of the fortress as the

183
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:05,523
magma began to fill the interior, a very deft
escape was made, aside from Vax unfortunately

184
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:10,173
getting his foot temporarily submerged in the
lava, taking some serious damage to his foot.

185
00:17:10,173 --> 00:17:16,059
The party manage to make their way outside of the
Emberhold proper, and you've all taken a moment to

186
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:20,199
breathe at this point, realizing that thankfully,
for the most part, you've all survived. Aside from

187
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:24,439
the missing party member and a few in a state of
flux at the moment.

188
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:32,191
So, picking up there where we left off. You're all
breathing heavily. The sincerity of the battle has

189
00:17:32,191 --> 00:17:34,859
just come over you. The adrenaline's still pumping
through your system.

190
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:36,105
LAURA: Your foot is melted off.

191
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:37,920
LIAM: It's kind of there (groans).

192
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:40,733
MATT: Mostly. There's some... You can see four of
the five toes.

193
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:42,595
LAURA: Oh, that's not bad. It's four out of five.

194
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:43,827
MATT: About three and a half.

195
00:17:43,827 --> 00:17:45,931
LIAM: Did I lose the big or the small?

196
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,280
MATT: (laughs) This would be the small.

197
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,421
ASHLEY: Oh, you can do without the pinkie.

198
00:17:50,421 --> 00:17:52,206
MARISHA: Your balance is probably a little wonky.

199
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:56,904
MATT: Yeah, a little bit.

200
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:59,291
LIAM: Clears that athlete's foot, though. Gone.

201
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,335
MATT: Sure enough.

202
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:04,033
SAM: Is anyone following us? Can we do a quick
check around and just see?

203
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:05,411
MATT: Make a perception check.

204
00:18:05,411 --> 00:18:11,443
SAM: Perception check? Starting it off with a 19.

205
00:18:11,443 --> 00:18:20,320
MATT: Glancing around, you start hearing various
duergar screams from above as the individuals that

206
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,116
were still inside the fortress are in the process
of trying to get out, or in the process of slowly

207
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:31,973
melting in the molten rock. What you do also
notice is that off towards the bottom base of the

208
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:36,553
stronghold, a number of duergar that reside in the
buildings that surround the exterior of Emberhold

209
00:18:36,553 --> 00:18:42,369
proper are mounting arms and charging up towards
the stronghold to give aid to wherever this

210
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:45,845
seeming, loud shouting and screaming is coming
from

211
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:47,163
LAURA: Can they see us?

212
00:18:47,163 --> 00:18:48,784
MARISHA: Does anyone seem to be paying attention
to us?

213
00:18:48,784 --> 00:18:50,709
MATT: No, they're far enough away where you don't
think it's an issue, and you're off to the side,

214
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:55,287
for the moment. But you do see probably close to
30 to 40 duergar are currently swarming out the

215
00:18:55,287 --> 00:18:58,336
small city, making their way towards Emberhold.

216
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:01,361
MARISHA: So right now they're focused on the chaos
of the temple?

217
00:19:01,361 --> 00:19:03,529
MATT: From what you can see.

218
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:04,781
SAM: We should get out of here.

219
00:19:04,781 --> 00:19:07,014
LAURA: There was a path further down that led
further on into the tunnels. I think we should

220
00:19:07,014 --> 00:19:08,145
follow that.

221
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:13,202
MARISHA: Well, hang on. Grog can't be far, right?

222
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:15,042
SAM: He could be in another dimension.

223
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:17,799
MARISHA: No, he can only be a thousand feet away.

224
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:19,106
SAM: Says who?

225
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:24,114
MARISHA: They used the spell Dimension Door that
Tiberius has.

226
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:26,878
LAURA: So we hope he used Dimension Door.

227
00:19:26,878 --> 00:19:29,176
SAM: I have a spell that can go to another
dimension (chuckles).

228
00:19:29,176 --> 00:19:33,772
MARISHA: Well, I remember the gods on high telling
us last week that

229
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:37,031
we recognized the spell that was used.

230
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:40,711
SAM: By the way, this is the best conversation
we've ever had with Tiberius.

231
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:43,174
(all laugh)

232
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:45,405
LAURA: Oh, Tiberius.

233
00:19:45,405 --> 00:19:54,895
MARISHA: Aw man, I feel that comes back to bite us
in the ass later (nervous laugh) because he is

234
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:56,301
still conscious, right?

235
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:57,478
MATT: No.

236
00:19:57,478 --> 00:19:59,384
LAURA: He has no idea what's happening.

237
00:19:59,384 --> 00:20:01,267
MATT: He's in darkness. He can't hear. He's not
conscious.

238
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:04,458
SAM: If Grog is close, we still need to get out of
the way of these 30 people. So let's go hide.

239
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,085
LAURA: We still need to hide. And heal.

240
00:20:06,085 --> 00:20:09,110
TALIESIN: Let's at least follow the path, find a
place where we can hide, and recuperate.

241
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,983
LAURA: Around the corner or something. Can we
stealth further down?

242
00:20:11,983 --> 00:20:17,347
MATT: You can try to. You currently are carrying
two large solid stone statues with you, so it's

243
00:20:17,347 --> 00:20:21,788
definitely possible, but you're going to have to
come up with a creative way of doing so.

244
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:23,689
TALIESIN: Grog had the rug, didn't he?

245
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,474
MATT: Grog had the entire bag of holding.

246
00:20:25,514 --> 00:20:26,335
TALIESIN: Shit!

247
00:20:26,335 --> 00:20:28,566
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and cast Pass
Without a Trace on the party.

248
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:29,595
MATT: Okay.

249
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,912
LIAM: Percy, I think you and I are on Tiberius
duty.

250
00:20:31,912 --> 00:20:33,621
TALIESIN: Yes. (sighs) Okay.

251
00:20:33,621 --> 00:20:40,213
SAM: If we do not move, will this 30 duergar mass
hit us at some point?

252
00:20:40,213 --> 00:20:41,246
MATT: You can find out.

253
00:20:41,246 --> 00:20:42,677
SAM: Oh, Jesus (laughs)

254
00:20:42,677 --> 00:20:44,457
ORION: It's like asking the future.

255
00:20:44,457 --> 00:20:51,035
LAURA: Can I use my robe of infinite twine, which
I have on my person in another game before.

256
00:20:51,148 --> 00:20:59,926
Because it's connected to my rope. Can I use that
and tie it around Kima and hook it to Trinket so

257
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,417
he can drag Kima along?

258
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:02,333
MATT: You can.

259
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,077
LAURA: Okay.

260
00:21:03,077 --> 00:21:04,350
TALIESIN: Very clever.

261
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,305
MATT: So I will say for this circumstance as you
guys are preparing this: casting the spell,

262
00:21:07,305 --> 00:21:12,346
beginning dragging the stone. The group make an
initiative check.

263
00:21:12,914 --> 00:21:14,960
SAM: We took too much time!

264
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,229
LAURA: We should just run.

265
00:21:17,229 --> 00:21:19,105
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

266
00:21:19,105 --> 00:21:21,579
MATT: Yeah, you have some flashing, there we go.

267
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:23,190
MARISHA: That's been a kind die to you.

268
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,281
MATT: So, 20 plus whatever your initiative
modifier is.

269
00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:26,149
TALIESIN: 27.

270
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:26,812
MATT: 27.

271
00:21:26,812 --> 00:21:28,457
MARISHA: 13.

272
00:21:28,457 --> 00:21:29,484
ORION: Who cares.

273
00:21:29,484 --> 00:21:30,847
SAM: Ten.

274
00:21:30,847 --> 00:21:31,773
ASHLEY: 12.

275
00:21:31,773 --> 00:21:32,645
LAURA: 17.

276
00:21:32,645 --> 00:21:33,598
LIAM: 15.

277
00:21:33,598 --> 00:21:35,798
MATT: All right.

278
00:21:39,746 --> 00:21:43,400
SAM: Distract them. Get them away from us.

279
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:49,052
MATT: You guys begin to drag the stone, or
(chuckles) your two stone companions across the

280
00:21:49,052 --> 00:21:56,062
jagged obsidian floor in this deep, dark cavern.
The heat from the nearby lava fall is still

281
00:21:56,062 --> 00:22:00,570
causing you to sweat profusely, and you're sore
from the previous battle you just endured. Those

282
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,185
of you who are wounded, you can feel the stretch
of the muscles and tearing of what sinew has taken

283
00:22:04,185 --> 00:22:05,926
damage in the process.

284
00:22:05,926 --> 00:22:14,612
As you begin to pull, parallel to this duct of
lava that pours off the side of Emberhold, you

285
00:22:14,612 --> 00:22:18,859
keep low so that you aren't actually blocking the
light source, which would be a very keen visual to

286
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:24,303
anything that's looking in that direction from a
distance, but you slowly make your way across. At

287
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:29,425
this point, the duergar have not been able to get
there before you guys move off from the side, so

288
00:22:29,425 --> 00:22:32,059
they haven't caught up to the position you were
previously, but they're beginning to swarm around

289
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,821
the sides, and you see them yelling at each other
and shouting commands. Some of them are starting

290
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:41,431
to grab large rocks and fill in areas of the
stronghold. Some of them you can see are robed

291
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:45,721
individuals begin casting spells. You can see
portions of other stone walls beginning to mount

292
00:22:45,721 --> 00:22:49,522
up and try and block the flow from the interior
and exterior of Emberhold.

293
00:22:49,522 --> 00:22:56,460
However, you guys are still within eyesight,
technically, of any duergar on that side of the

294
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,999
fortress, so I'm going to ask everyone now to make
a stealth check. Those that are pulling the

295
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:04,354
statues with disadvantage.

296
00:23:04,354 --> 00:23:05,529
LAURA: So that's Trinket.

297
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:08,360
ORION: Plus ten.

298
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,790
LAURA: But we all add plus ten?

299
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,995
MATT: Correct. To the final roll.

300
00:23:10,995 --> 00:23:11,813
LAURA: Okay.

301
00:23:11,813 --> 00:23:15,426
LIAM: I have a question. If I have advantage for
other reasons-- I have a cloak of elvenkind which

302
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,562
gives me advantage-- does the advantage and
disadvantage cancel out into one?

303
00:23:18,562 --> 00:23:23,871
MATT: They do. Your foot being wounded, though, is
a disadvantage right now.

304
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:24,881
LIAM: Right.

305
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:27,540
MATT: So that then goes back down to
disadvantage.

306
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,482
SAM: Can't win with this guy.

307
00:23:29,482 --> 00:23:33,260
MATT: Just for this circumstance, unfortunately.
You're dragging a statue with a partially melted

308
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,241
foot right now.

309
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:35,732
TALIESIN: Liam, it doesn't matter.

310
00:23:35,732 --> 00:23:37,972
MARISHA: You still have plus ten to the roll
because Pass Without a Trace.

311
00:23:37,972 --> 00:23:38,740
MATT: So?

312
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,417
SAM: 14.

313
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:40,208
MATT: Plus the ten?

314
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,077
SAM: That's including the ten.

315
00:23:41,077 --> 00:23:42,811
MATT: All right.

316
00:23:42,811 --> 00:23:44,347
MARISHA: 22.

317
00:23:44,347 --> 00:23:45,625
TALIESIN: 11.

318
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,959
ASHLEY: 20. That's my low roll.

319
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:52,077
LAURA: That's 20 for Trinket and 29 for me.

320
00:23:52,077 --> 00:23:53,915
LIAM: 25.

321
00:23:53,915 --> 00:24:01,549
MATT: All right, so you keep hunched low, slowly
(stone grinding noise) dragging these stone

322
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:09,855
obelisks of individuals across the jagged floor.
You seemingly do so without any of the duergars'

323
00:24:09,855 --> 00:24:14,460
eyes catching you through the low light of the
cavern. Partially due to the fact that you guys

324
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,892
are doing a pretty decent job and partially the
fact they're more obsessed that the central piece

325
00:24:17,892 --> 00:24:23,989
of their fortress right now is essentially about
to be completely filled with molten rock.

326
00:24:23,989 --> 00:24:30,062
About 20, 25 minutes or so, you manage to pull
just past where the lava flow dips down into what

327
00:24:30,062 --> 00:24:36,407
looks like a small opening in the flooring, and
you are past the immediate heat of the magma

328
00:24:36,407 --> 00:24:41,568
river. You are now pressed up against the wall of
the cavern as it begins to twist around and head

329
00:24:41,568 --> 00:24:50,111
downward, further deeper into this subterranean
mountainous space. You're all beaten, you're all

330
00:24:50,111 --> 00:24:56,120
sore, and currently, what do you want to do?

331
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,745
TALIESIN: Keyleth, can you cover the entrance to
where we are to give us a

332
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:01,353
little bit more of a stealthy--

333
00:25:01,353 --> 00:25:02,419
MARISHA: No.

334
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:03,567
LAURA: No more spells?

335
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:06,893
MARISHA: I am exhausted. I can't do anything else
right now.

336
00:25:06,893 --> 00:25:12,117
LIAM: And what's the terrain? Is it just flat out
out in the open to see, or is it scoured with ins

337
00:25:12,117 --> 00:25:13,304
and outs? Peaks and valleys?

338
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:16,134
MATT: It's the same type of topography you've
encountered when you first entered this giant

339
00:25:16,185 --> 00:25:23,266
cavern. So you can see large, crooked black spires
of obsidian rock shooting up and curving towards

340
00:25:23,266 --> 00:25:26,039
the ceiling. It's all over the place.

341
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:29,111
MARISHA: I can make another Hallucinatory Terrain.
I can do that still.

342
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:32,350
LAURA: Okay, maybe you can make it--

343
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,354
MARISHA: Can I make it to where it just looks like
a wall?

344
00:25:35,354 --> 00:25:36,915
MATT: How long does it last?

345
00:25:36,915 --> 00:25:41,211
MARISHA: I think Hallucinatory Terrain lasts an
hour, if I think about it. Books, books, where's

346
00:25:41,211 --> 00:25:42,274
my book?

347
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:46,346
LAURA: Can I look around and and see if there's
anywhere that looks like we could hide, tuck in

348
00:25:46,346 --> 00:25:48,445
between rocks or something where we wouldn't be
visible?

349
00:25:48,445 --> 00:25:49,434
TALIESIN: Please.

350
00:25:49,434 --> 00:25:52,452
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception.

351
00:25:53,981 --> 00:25:57,176
LAURA: Oh wait, I get an advantage.

352
00:25:57,176 --> 00:25:59,068
MATT: Because you are in the Underdark, correct.

353
00:25:59,068 --> 00:25:59,906
LAURA: 20.

354
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:01,182
MARISHA: It lasts for 24 hours.

355
00:26:01,182 --> 00:26:02,728
SAM: 24 hours!

356
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,102
TALIESIN: Put a lava flow in front of us.

357
00:26:04,102 --> 00:26:08,168
SAM: But you have to be concentrating the whole
time. And you can't. You can't go to sleep.

358
00:26:08,168 --> 00:26:10,000
LAURA: 20.

359
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,273
MATT: As she's glancing at that, you make your way
about ten minutes away from the area where the

360
00:26:16,273 --> 00:26:19,994
rest of the group is currently gathered, keeping a
very very close eye on the topography of the wall

361
00:26:20,165 --> 00:26:24,770
of the cavern as it slowly curves around and
further in that direction. You do manage to find

362
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:31,191
portions of the wall that jut out and leave these
small pockets. They themselves might not be super

363
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:36,658
safe for a long period of time, but they give you
a little bit of--

364
00:26:36,658 --> 00:26:37,777
LAURA: Cover.

365
00:26:37,777 --> 00:26:41,659
MATT: Little bit of cover, depending on how well
you were to dress. You might be able to see few

366
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:44,458
individuals discovering you if you were to stay
there.

367
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:47,032
LAURA: Okay. Let's do that.

368
00:26:47,032 --> 00:26:51,844
MARISHA: It's not a concentration spell. It just
takes a minute to cast and it lasts for 24 hours.

369
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:57,403
So I'm going to go ahead and cast it and make it
look like there's just a wall with another lava

370
00:26:57,403 --> 00:27:01,367
flow that's come out, and is starting to happen.

371
00:27:01,367 --> 00:27:06,020
MATT: Okay, so as you walk back to notify the
party, you watch as a portion of the mountain

372
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:11,225
seemingly out of nowhere, extends, and a lava flow
appears, pouring out of the wall.

373
00:27:11,225 --> 00:27:12,871
MARISHA: Wait, was someone not inside?

374
00:27:12,871 --> 00:27:14,250
SAM: No, we're all in.

375
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,825
MATT: She was out and about while you did this.

376
00:27:15,825 --> 00:27:17,231
LAURA: I was searching for another place to hide.

377
00:27:17,231 --> 00:27:19,512
LIAM: It's fine. It's an illusion. Vax pokes his
head through the illusionary lava and goes,

378
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:20,781
We're in here.

379
00:27:20,781 --> 00:27:23,524
LAURA: Oh! Lovely.

380
00:27:23,524 --> 00:27:29,260
MATT: So your heart rate eventually normalizes.
You do have a decent pocket of space here that as

381
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:33,260
long as nothing attempts to walk into the wall,
you should be okay to rest here.

382
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,425
TALIESIN: So we have some time. Let's regroup.

383
00:27:35,425 --> 00:27:36,862
LAURA: I think we should probably--

384
00:27:36,862 --> 00:27:37,936
TALIESIN: Sleep in shifts.

385
00:27:37,936 --> 00:27:41,642
MARISHA: Wait, here's what I'm afraid of. If we
sleep we could lose Grog's trail. He could be

386
00:27:41,642 --> 00:27:43,655
nearby right now.

387
00:27:43,655 --> 00:27:45,849
TALIESIN: We're not much use to anyone right now.

388
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:50,280
SAM: Let's just make a decision right now to leave
Grog and continue on.

389
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,829
ASHLEY: No!

390
00:27:51,829 --> 00:27:53,655
SAM: Let's just forget about him. He was a good
friend.

391
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:54,638
LAURA: What?!

392
00:27:54,638 --> 00:27:55,465
SAM: We'll have a toast to him.

393
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,529
LAURA and ASHLEY: Scanlan!

394
00:27:56,529 --> 00:27:58,015
SAM: We'll sing about songs of his memory.

395
00:27:58,015 --> 00:27:59,761
MARISHA: You are shitting with us, right?!

396
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,518
SAM: Within a few days we'll forget he ever
existed.

397
00:28:01,518 --> 00:28:04,478
TALIESIN: Scanlan, no one else wants to go to a
whorehouse with you. You'll be going to

398
00:28:04,478 --> 00:28:05,553
whorehouses alone.

399
00:28:05,553 --> 00:28:06,744
SAM: All right, fine.

400
00:28:06,744 --> 00:28:07,828
TALIESIN: Thank you.

401
00:28:07,828 --> 00:28:11,075
LIAM: Here's another option. My foot hurts, but
I'm not too bad. How are you?

402
00:28:11,075 --> 00:28:12,535
LAURA: (sighs) I'm okay.

403
00:28:12,535 --> 00:28:14,549
LIAM: We could go look.

404
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:25,528
LAURA: Or maybe I can use my tracking and see if I
can catch a scent. Grog does smell.

405
00:28:25,528 --> 00:28:30,790
MARISHA: I can use my beast sense; that is one
more thing I can still do. I could theoretically--

406
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:33,779
We could use Trinket.

407
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:40,212
LIAM: We need to undo the stone that has taken
over Tiberius and Kima.

408
00:28:40,212 --> 00:28:49,084
TALIESIN: Do I have the necessary tools to
synthesize a potion out of the basilisk blood?

409
00:28:49,084 --> 00:28:54,160
MATT: You can certainly try. It's a very
ramshackle set-up. You do not have an alchemical

410
00:28:54,160 --> 00:29:01,707
set, but you can certainly attempt to, using a
small fire, a couple of your general smelting

411
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:06,878
tools you use for your metal work. You could
attempt to distill it down, but that would be a

412
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:10,728
combination of a tinkering roll on your point,
followed up by somebody else's medicine roll to

413
00:29:10,728 --> 00:29:12,984
attempt to properly prepare it.

414
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,483
LAURA: Are all of Tiberius's things stone with
him?

415
00:29:15,483 --> 00:29:16,391
MATT: Yes.

416
00:29:16,391 --> 00:29:22,702
ASHLEY: I'm going to walk over to Tiberius and
cast Greater Restoration on him.

417
00:29:22,702 --> 00:29:31,442
MATT: Okay. So as you're having this discussion.
Tiberius, you briefly go from this moment in the

418
00:29:31,442 --> 00:29:38,533
heat of combat where you feel your muscles
intensify and tensing up and not answering to your

419
00:29:38,533 --> 00:29:43,999
mind's command as you look up angrily at a series
of duergar that have just been blown up by a

420
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:51,097
fireball, to cold taking yourself. And as the cold
fades, you are now in the center of a gargantuan

421
00:29:51,097 --> 00:29:54,306
cavern surrounded by all of your friends. You guys
watch as Tiberius's form

422
00:29:54,306 --> 00:29:56,228
fades in through the stone.

423
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:57,946
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Tiberius!

424
00:29:57,946 --> 00:29:59,158
LAURA: Good job Pike!

425
00:29:59,158 --> 00:30:00,941
SAM: I was so worried about you!

426
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:03,991
TALIESIN: Or we could cast a spell. That also
works well.

427
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,736
ORION: (Dwarven accent) What the hell is going
on?

428
00:30:05,736 --> 00:30:06,770
ASHLEY: I didn't know if that was going to work.

429
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:07,934
MARISHA: But that the only time you can do that,
right?

430
00:30:07,934 --> 00:30:09,481
LAURA: Wait, she can't do that again? You can't do
it again for Kima.

431
00:30:09,481 --> 00:30:12,976
ASHLEY: I have another 5th level now, so I could
do it again.

432
00:30:12,976 --> 00:30:15,258
LAURA: And once we rest, you'll have it
again?

433
00:30:15,258 --> 00:30:17,981
ORION: (Dwarven accent) Whoa. What happened to all
the other little dwarves?

434
00:30:18,023 --> 00:30:19,538
SAM: You don't have to do the accent anymore.

435
00:30:19,538 --> 00:30:21,826
LAURA: You probably should keep your voice down,
Tiberius.

436
00:30:21,826 --> 00:30:24,585
ORION: Well, this is just how I sound.

437
00:30:24,585 --> 00:30:29,911
ASHLEY: No. We already got through. We're on the
other side.

438
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:33,630
You don't have to act like a god anymore.

439
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:37,512
LAURA: Grog is missing, actually.

440
00:30:37,512 --> 00:30:39,647
ORION: (Dwarven accent) Oh, great.

441
00:30:39,647 --> 00:30:41,616
LAURA: And the queen took him.

442
00:30:41,616 --> 00:30:43,275
SAM: Are you stuck like this?

443
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,984
ORION: No, I could change back anytime I want, but
I really like how I look.

444
00:30:45,984 --> 00:30:47,493
(all laugh)

445
00:30:47,493 --> 00:30:50,180
ASHLEY: Are we going to rest?

446
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,598
SAM: Wait, but what about Kima?

447
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,659
MARISHA: We have to find Grog!

448
00:30:53,659 --> 00:30:59,695
LAURA: We have to find Grog but we have no spells.
If we do find him, we can't do anything!

449
00:30:59,695 --> 00:31:02,032
SAM: Can you unstone Kima now or?

450
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:05,435
ASHLEY: I can, but then I wouldn't have another
5th level.

451
00:31:05,435 --> 00:31:09,510
ORION: (Dwarven accent) Clarota, what do you think
we should do?

452
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:15,078
MATT: Clarota, who is currently like staring at
the statue of Kima, you can see there's a brief

453
00:31:15,078 --> 00:31:20,119
bead of thought behind Clarota's eyes and the
voice sinks into the rest of your minds

454
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:27,138
simultaneously. "We may be able to leave her here
for safekeeping."

455
00:31:27,138 --> 00:31:32,078
ORION: I knew you were going to say that. A
different option. Oh, and thank you, Pike.

456
00:31:32,078 --> 00:31:33,847
ASHLEY: You're welcome, Tiberius.

457
00:31:33,847 --> 00:31:35,900
(all laugh)

458
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:42,723
MATT: "If you insist on bringing her, then we
should do it soon. We should not be leaving

459
00:31:42,723 --> 00:31:49,993
"anything behind. Trace of our passage."

460
00:31:50,347 --> 00:31:55,572
LIAM: Where did your kin take our big friend?

461
00:31:55,572 --> 00:32:05,238
MATT: Clarota thinks for a second and says, "It
was not my kin that took him but the duergar. If

462
00:32:05,238 --> 00:32:12,769
"anything, I imagine he might be residing within
that infernal city, though if they've taken him

463
00:32:12,769 --> 00:32:18,349
"elsewhere I do not know the way of the
ash-skins."

464
00:32:18,349 --> 00:32:20,162
ORION: But Kima does.

465
00:32:20,162 --> 00:32:21,580
LAURA: We should wake her up.

466
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,463
ORION: Pike, you can do it one more time and take
a little rest, right?

467
00:32:23,463 --> 00:32:30,598
ASHLEY: I am going to walk on over to Kima. Touch
her. Cast Greater Restoration again.

468
00:32:30,598 --> 00:32:31,618
MATT: Okay.

469
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:33,022
LAURA: Where do you touch her? (laughs)

470
00:32:33,022 --> 00:32:40,748
ASHLEY: I touch her arm.

471
00:32:40,748 --> 00:32:41,927
MATT: Okay.

472
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:43,420
TALIESIN: Don't cheapen this.

473
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:51,514
MATT: Classy. As you reach out, the divine energy
emanates from Pike's hand that begins to cascade

474
00:32:51,514 --> 00:32:56,388
across Kima's form. Kima, who is in mid battle,
with her greatsword in the air, as soon as her

475
00:32:56,388 --> 00:32:58,683
flesh returns to her, she finishes her swing.

476
00:32:58,683 --> 00:33:02,269
ASHLEY: I put my shield up!

477
00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:07,294
MATT: However, it does (ping) into the side of
your shield and you deflect the blow and you see

478
00:33:07,294 --> 00:33:09,712
Kima for a second is like, (panting slowing to
normal breathing).

479
00:33:09,712 --> 00:33:10,813
LIAM: Easy! Easy!

480
00:33:10,813 --> 00:33:12,511
ASHLEY: Calm down!

481
00:33:12,511 --> 00:33:16,791
MATT: She throws the blade down on the ground and
goes, "I am so sorry."

482
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:23,529
ASHLEY: It's okay! You were mid-swing, I get it.
We are fine it was just a shield. We're fine.

483
00:33:23,529 --> 00:33:26,691
MATT: She reaches around and she pulls her symbol
of Bahamut out from her around her neck and just

484
00:33:26,691 --> 00:33:31,349
clutches it for a second and says, "What
happened?"

485
00:33:31,349 --> 00:33:38,013
LAURA: You were turned to stone, the king got
killed, the queen took Grog, we don't know where.

486
00:33:38,013 --> 00:33:41,894
SAM: And Clarota was really helpful to us.

487
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,884
LAURA: Actually, Clarota got you out of that
castle alive.

488
00:33:44,884 --> 00:33:48,095
MATT: She turns around and glares at Clarota
briefly with a look of confusion and mistrust and

489
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:50,229
Clarota just goes--

490
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:53,010
(all laugh)

491
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:57,644
LIAM: You honestly would not be here if it
weren't for the illithid. It's true.

492
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,279
MATT: She glances back at you and gives under her
breath, "And there's a good chance none of us may

493
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:09,235
"be here if it gets its way down the road. (louder)
Nevertheless, I thank you. It is good to know at

494
00:34:09,235 --> 00:34:17,561
"least we took one of their top champions down. The
fact that the queen still exists is worrisome, as

495
00:34:17,561 --> 00:34:25,126
"at least from what I seemed to gather she had the
true reign over most of the duergar down here."

496
00:34:25,126 --> 00:34:27,555
ORION: Do you know where she would be at?

497
00:34:27,555 --> 00:34:29,767
MATT: "Where did she escape? How did she take
him?"

498
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:33,269
LIAM: She disappeared with our goliath friend.

499
00:34:33,269 --> 00:34:39,860
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my gosh. Wait, did I Hunter's
Mark the queen?

500
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,159
LIAM: Yes, you did.

501
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:41,984
LAURA: Did I?

502
00:34:41,984 --> 00:34:43,225
TALIESIN: You did.

503
00:34:43,225 --> 00:34:44,780
LAURA: I can use my Hunter's Mark to track her!

504
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,774
SAM: You can?

505
00:34:45,774 --> 00:34:51,251
(all cheer)

506
00:34:51,251 --> 00:34:53,190
SAM: How long does it last and how does it work?

507
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,799
LIAM: But that was just 30 minutes ago.

508
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:56,361
SAM: I know, but we all have to rest.

509
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:57,989
LAURA: It maintains for up to eight hours!

510
00:34:57,989 --> 00:35:03,484
SAM: Eight hours, but we have to rest!

511
00:35:04,721 --> 00:35:09,055
ASHLEY: Because we need to heal. I am pretty low.

512
00:35:09,055 --> 00:35:10,483
SAM: I'm at two.

513
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,274
ASHLEY: You're at two?!

514
00:35:12,274 --> 00:35:24,958
MARISHA: Okay. Theory? Proposition? Proposal. What
if we use your Hunter's Mark, figure out where she

515
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:30,065
is, get there, camp out nearby, tackle it in the
morning?

516
00:35:30,065 --> 00:35:35,528
LAURA: Can I use my Hunter's Mark to find out
where she is and then we rest and go there?

517
00:35:35,661 --> 00:35:40,072
MATT: You can attempt that.

518
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:42,821
ASHLEY: What if we took a short rest?

519
00:35:42,821 --> 00:35:45,335
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait. Let's just find out where
she is first.

520
00:35:45,335 --> 00:35:47,377
ASHLEY: What if we just took a seven-hour nap?

521
00:35:47,377 --> 00:35:49,460
(all laugh)

522
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,941
ASHLEY: Because that's all really anyone sleeps
anyway.

523
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,569
TALIESIN: I think six hours is about what it
takes.

524
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:58,378
MATT: Six to eight hours is the general long rest
period that I would allow for that.

525
00:35:58,378 --> 00:35:59,931
LAURA and ASHLEY: Okay.

526
00:35:59,931 --> 00:36:03,868
LIAM: I think we should all rest for a moment. I
think Vex'ahlia and I should go out for an hour or

527
00:36:03,868 --> 00:36:08,274
two, just to see which direction-- I mean, they
are not going to back to Emon.

528
00:36:08,274 --> 00:36:10,433
LAURA: I've got Hunter's Mark! Just stay put,
Footless!

529
00:36:10,433 --> 00:36:11,601
(all laugh)

530
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:12,999
ORION: Wait a minute. What happened to your toe?

531
00:36:12,999 --> 00:36:16,450
SAM: You're not stealth anymore. You got a busted
foot. You're at disadvantage on everything.

532
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:20,163
LIAM: I was pretty awesome 30 minutes ago. Now I'm
just slightly less awesome.

533
00:36:20,163 --> 00:36:23,187
SAM: Can we at least heal you up, before you go?

534
00:36:23,187 --> 00:36:28,141
LAURA: Yes. Just give us one second. Can I use the
freaking Hunter's Mark?

535
00:36:28,141 --> 00:36:29,168
SAM: How does it work?

536
00:36:29,168 --> 00:36:30,748
LAURA: I don't know!

537
00:36:30,748 --> 00:36:36,762
MATT: So you take a moment, you step beyond the
boundary of the illusion momentarily, close your

538
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:43,603
eyes and concentrate on that small blip of nature
based divine energy that you lent and grappled

539
00:36:43,603 --> 00:36:49,191
onto Queen Ulara with. You take a moment and
concentrate and you recall her face, you recall,

540
00:36:49,191 --> 00:36:54,689
strangely, her scent. In a weird way, the bestial
nature of your connection with Trinket and nature,

541
00:36:54,689 --> 00:37:02,008
scent is a very strong means of tracking and the
scent of a duergar is a very terrible mix between

542
00:37:02,008 --> 00:37:07,199
salty brine and earth.

543
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:09,896
LIAM: Like Axe for Men?

544
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:17,559
MATT: Essentially, yeah, yeah. It's Ye Olde Axe.
You concentrate on this and you recall the

545
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:22,646
stronghold, you begin to see a trace where all of
a sudden her path in the stronghold is fading and is

546
00:37:22,646 --> 00:37:28,074
cold. A new path has opened up in the center of
the duergar city at the base of the stronghold. It

547
00:37:28,074 --> 00:37:33,110
seems to have moved slightly in that direction,
but you can't pinpoint where, and is currently at

548
00:37:33,277 --> 00:37:35,572
rest somewhere in that vicinity.

549
00:37:35,572 --> 00:37:37,491
SAM: She is still close.

550
00:37:37,491 --> 00:37:40,861
LAURA: (whispers) The city, they're close.
(louder) So that is right in front of the keep?

551
00:37:40,861 --> 00:37:43,412
MARISHA: Wait. Are they in an underground base?

552
00:37:43,412 --> 00:37:44,943
LAURA: They are in the city.

553
00:37:44,943 --> 00:37:49,826
MATT: Essentially, where the cavern kind of rises up
and meets the wall, Emberhold is at the top of

554
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:54,155
that rising of the ground, and Emberhold lies
there, where all the lava pours down and trickles

555
00:37:54,155 --> 00:37:59,639
down. You guys are off to the side. This whole
portion of the floor that crawls up to Emberhold

556
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:04,686
is covered in duergar buildings. It is a small
city that surrounds it. She resides somewhere in

557
00:38:04,686 --> 00:38:06,126
the center of that.

558
00:38:06,126 --> 00:38:10,095
MARISHA: So we're on the same level as them or are
they above us?

559
00:38:10,095 --> 00:38:14,484
MATT: They are a little bit above. You guys are at
a lower point, as the actual ground you follow

560
00:38:14,484 --> 00:38:16,937
curves around and descends.

561
00:38:16,937 --> 00:38:19,322
SAM: But once we walk out of here we will be at
the same level.

562
00:38:19,322 --> 00:38:29,602
MARISHA: I have a theory. I've a new skill that
I've recently learned and was practicing a lot

563
00:38:29,602 --> 00:38:36,136
when I was with the Earth Ashari while we were
gone for the past six months. They taught me the

564
00:38:36,136 --> 00:38:38,419
ways of the earth elementals.

565
00:38:38,419 --> 00:38:40,012
ORION: Oh, that's fun.

566
00:38:40,012 --> 00:38:43,881
MARISHA: So. And as an earth-- but I am still new
at it.

567
00:38:43,881 --> 00:38:46,586
ASHLEY: That's okay, we all start somewhere.

568
00:38:46,586 --> 00:38:47,713
MARISHA: Thank you, Pike.

569
00:38:47,713 --> 00:38:49,012
ASHLEY: You're welcome.

570
00:38:49,012 --> 00:38:53,651
MARISHA: Thank you. I mean I am a little
self-conscious about it still, but I can travel

571
00:38:53,651 --> 00:38:56,696
through the earth.

572
00:38:56,696 --> 00:38:58,484
LAURA: And pop up, perhaps, where she is?

573
00:38:58,484 --> 00:39:01,622
ORION: (Dwarven accent) Ooh, like a little
gopher.

574
00:39:01,622 --> 00:39:04,294
LAURA: All of us? Or just you?

575
00:39:04,294 --> 00:39:06,844
MARISHA: It is not a burrowing thing, right?

576
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,017
MATT: You glide through the earth.

577
00:39:09,017 --> 00:39:11,002
LIAM: More like a Shadowcat kind of thing?

578
00:39:11,002 --> 00:39:11,926
MATT: Essentially.

579
00:39:11,926 --> 00:39:13,272
LAURA: Is it all of us or just you?

580
00:39:13,272 --> 00:39:18,319
MARISHA: Just me. But I could get inside.

581
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:22,462
LAURA: Well, but then you will be alone,
surrounded by duergar and Grog.

582
00:39:22,462 --> 00:39:24,141
MARISHA: Well, I am not talking about right now.

583
00:39:24,141 --> 00:39:25,579
ASHLEY: Could we put invisibility on her?

584
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:28,136
MARISHA: If we do some sort of flanking thing.

585
00:39:28,136 --> 00:39:29,585
LIAM: Well that does sound useful.

586
00:39:29,585 --> 00:39:30,992
TALIESIN: It is. It is going to be useful.

587
00:39:30,992 --> 00:39:41,733
MARISHA: I am wondering if we can make a tunnel,
though. I can theoretically-- okay, theoretically

588
00:39:41,733 --> 00:39:51,012
we could rest and I could keep all of my spells
and use all of my magical focus to tunnel us out,

589
00:39:51,012 --> 00:39:55,881
depending on how far we are going. We can do an
underground approach

590
00:39:55,881 --> 00:39:58,215
LIAM: But concretely, right now we need nappies.

591
00:39:58,215 --> 00:39:59,175
MARISHA: Yeah.

592
00:39:59,175 --> 00:40:00,384
TALIESIN: Let's sleep.

593
00:40:00,384 --> 00:40:02,466
MARISHA: But what if they leave while we sleep?

594
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,969
LIAM: But we are essentially powerless.

595
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,560
TALIESIN: And what are we going to do if we find
them?

596
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,135
LAURA: I'm going to only sleep for a little bit,
cause I didn't use all my spells I only need to

597
00:40:08,135 --> 00:40:11,670
rest for half the amount of time, maybe.

598
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,934
MATT: It doesn't work that way.

599
00:40:12,934 --> 00:40:15,233
(all laugh)

600
00:40:15,233 --> 00:40:20,281
MATT: A solid six hours you'd probably be able to,
since you guys are in a hidden area you'll feel

601
00:40:20,281 --> 00:40:22,276
more comfortable, depending on how you set your
bedding here you could

602
00:40:22,276 --> 00:40:23,680
probably do it in six hours.

603
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:29,611
LAURA: I think we'll be fine. Because she needs to
rest as well. We hurt her pretty badly.

604
00:40:29,611 --> 00:40:36,161
LIAM: I think it is safe to assume she's brought
Grog back to her seat of power. Why would she go

605
00:40:36,161 --> 00:40:40,110
anywhere else? She's at her strongest where she
is.

606
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,112
TALIESIN: I think they're staying.

607
00:40:43,112 --> 00:40:45,332
SAM: We're going to rest.

608
00:40:45,332 --> 00:40:46,782
LIAM: Sleep.

609
00:40:46,782 --> 00:40:48,169
MARISHA: Okay. All right.

610
00:40:48,169 --> 00:40:50,193
LAURA: We've got to sleep, Keyleth.

611
00:40:50,193 --> 00:40:53,483
ASHLEY: I know. You're right. I see what you're
saying, but we need to...

612
00:40:53,483 --> 00:40:54,679
SAM: Grog will be fine.

613
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:56,145
ASHLEY: He's at a two!

614
00:40:56,145 --> 00:41:00,080
MARISHA: I'm so mad at him. Why'd he get stolen?

615
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,874
MATT: Kima comes over, Kima puts her hand out a
little bit and says, "It's all right, he's a

616
00:41:03,902 --> 00:41:06,645
"strong one, he can handle himself. If I could
survive what I've been through, he can do far

617
00:41:06,645 --> 00:41:15,755
"better than that. Rest is good. I think we need to
take some time, discuss our plan of attack, our

618
00:41:15,755 --> 00:41:21,610
"current direction, and decide on how we'll move
forward." She glances briefly over at Clarota,

619
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:26,087
who's now further back towards the wall just
sitting in this meditative state.

620
00:41:26,087 --> 00:41:29,248
"So. Let us rest."

621
00:41:29,248 --> 00:41:30,690
TALIESIN: Brilliant idea.

622
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:35,560
LIAM: One last thing before we lay our heads down
for the night. Pike, do you have any salve or

623
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:45,224
anything you could help me put on my foot, or
could your god help with my little toe?

624
00:41:45,224 --> 00:41:50,736
MARISHA: I could help you with some natural
mediciney stuff, maybe.

625
00:41:50,736 --> 00:41:52,715
LIAM: It stings a bit.

626
00:41:52,715 --> 00:41:57,133
MATT: You have not encountered a person with any
sort of physical marring to this degree,

627
00:41:57,133 --> 00:42:01,756
necessarily, and those that usually did, it was a
permanent thing. So this is something that you

628
00:42:01,756 --> 00:42:04,816
would have to experiment with.

629
00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:13,214
ASHLEY: Could I try healing? A very concentrated
energy just on his foot? A healing spell?

630
00:42:13,214 --> 00:42:15,273
MATT: You could certainly try.

631
00:42:15,273 --> 00:42:17,134
LAURA: You can do it, Pike.

632
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:19,738
MARISHA: Is there anyway I could assist her?

633
00:42:19,738 --> 00:42:21,075
MATT: Possibly. All right.

634
00:42:21,075 --> 00:42:22,170
ASHLEY: Let's try it.

635
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:23,452
MARISHA: Possibly?

636
00:42:23,452 --> 00:42:29,218
LIAM: I mean a clockwork foot from Percy does
sound cool.

637
00:42:29,218 --> 00:42:31,470
ASHLEY: If we're going to rest, it doesn't hurt to
try.

638
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:34,237
MARISHA: That way we can sleep on it.

639
00:42:34,237 --> 00:42:35,775
ASHLEY: You can sleep on it.

640
00:42:35,775 --> 00:42:37,655
LIAM: Literally.

641
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:43,830
LAURA: Maybe this yellow vial of potion could do
something for it as well.

642
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:46,866
LIAM: That's Ben-gay.

643
00:42:46,993 --> 00:42:50,100
ASHLEY: I'll try Cure Wounds at, I'll try 4th
level, since we're going to sleep.

644
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:54,455
MATT: All right so go ahead and roll the
corresponding dice for that.

645
00:42:54,455 --> 00:42:56,148
ASHLEY: So I roll...

646
00:42:56,148 --> 00:42:58,620
MATT: 4d8 + 5 Is what it would be.

647
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,510
LAURA: Why do you keep putting your foot up near
me?

648
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:02,051
(all laugh)

649
00:43:02,051 --> 00:43:06,703
LAURA: Can I keep an ear out for anything
approaching?

650
00:43:06,703 --> 00:43:07,730
MATT: Very much so.

651
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,586
ASHLEY: Wait, plus my spell caster--

652
00:43:09,586 --> 00:43:11,347
MATT: Plus your modifier, which is five.

653
00:43:11,347 --> 00:43:18,324
MARISHA: I start building a positive chi. Like a
healing chi ball.

654
00:43:18,324 --> 00:43:24,880
SAM: Is she doing a standard healing here? Is my
song of rest going to help at all?

655
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,656
MATT: Your song of rest would actually be of aid
to this.

656
00:43:27,656 --> 00:43:31,677
SAM: Okay. So I'm going to sing while you heal, if
that's all right.

657
00:43:31,677 --> 00:43:33,230
ASHLEY: Please do.

658
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:36,252
MATT: All the healers convene, Scanlan begins--

659
00:43:36,252 --> 00:43:37,949
MARISHA: I light some sage.

660
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:46,896
SAM: Okay, ready? (singing) Wherever you go,
whatever damage they've done, we will be right

661
00:43:46,896 --> 00:43:56,572
here waiting to heal you. No matter what hit
points you take or how your foot breaks, we will

662
00:43:56,572 --> 00:43:58,816
be right here--

663
00:43:58,816 --> 00:44:01,473
SAM AND ASHLEY: Waiting for you.

664
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:02,952
LIAM: All that improv school paid off.

665
00:44:02,952 --> 00:44:04,799
(all laugh)

666
00:44:04,799 --> 00:44:10,418
MATT: As you take the healing energy you've
gathered from your own nature-based casting, you

667
00:44:10,418 --> 00:44:13,269
infuse the healing spell. You do how many points
of healing from the spell?

668
00:44:13,269 --> 00:44:14,286
ASHLEY: 27.

669
00:44:14,286 --> 00:44:17,208
MATT: 27. Go ahead and make a medicine check.

670
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:19,381
MARISHA: Is this what I can maybe assist her with?

671
00:44:19,381 --> 00:44:23,016
LAURA: It looks really disgusting by the way. It's
so gross.

672
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,255
ASHLEY: What do I roll? Do I roll the 20?

673
00:44:25,255 --> 00:44:27,004
MATT: Roll a d20, and add your proficiency
modifier

674
00:44:27,004 --> 00:44:29,349
LIAM: Can I apply my Luck feat to her?

675
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:31,324
LAURA: You don't have any feet left.

676
00:44:31,324 --> 00:44:34,327
(all laugh)

677
00:44:34,327 --> 00:44:36,164
SAM: Feet pun!

678
00:44:36,164 --> 00:44:37,301
ASHLEY: 21.

679
00:44:37,301 --> 00:44:46,776
MATT: 21. As you finish the spell, you can see
where the mostly-gone second small toe has grown

680
00:44:46,776 --> 00:44:51,600
to mostly a full toe, and there's a small stub
where the little one is.

681
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,112
LAURA: You've got a toe nubbin.

682
00:44:53,112 --> 00:44:56,169
ASHLEY: Hey man, we got a little stub. A little
bit.

683
00:44:56,169 --> 00:45:03,989
MATT: You're promoting a level of divine
regeneration at a very, very slow pace. You've

684
00:45:03,989 --> 00:45:08,263
never attempted this before, and there is some
progress, but this may be an over time thing you

685
00:45:08,263 --> 00:45:09,765
have to do.

686
00:45:09,765 --> 00:45:11,094
ASHLEY: Over time, I just keep doing it?

687
00:45:11,094 --> 00:45:15,158
MATT: Once a day, you might want to attempt this
and eventually he probably will recover. But not

688
00:45:15,158 --> 00:45:16,335
immediately.

689
00:45:16,335 --> 00:45:18,276
SAM: Until then, he's a gimp.

690
00:45:18,276 --> 00:45:22,674
LIAM: I think I see Pike's deity in my toenail!

691
00:45:22,674 --> 00:45:24,034
(all laugh)

692
00:45:24,034 --> 00:45:28,190
ASHLEY: It's gonna take time. That was just a
little manicure that we did real quick.

693
00:45:28,203 --> 00:45:30,509
MARISHA: We could just own it and call you--

694
00:45:30,509 --> 00:45:31,525
TALIESIN: Little piggy?

695
00:45:31,525 --> 00:45:33,440
MARISHA: Well I was going to say Vax the
Nine-Toe.

696
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,104
LIAM: And put a knife on it?

697
00:45:35,143 --> 00:45:36,661
TALIESIN: Could put a very tiny knife on it.

698
00:45:36,661 --> 00:45:38,217
LAURA: A teeny tiny little knife.

699
00:45:38,217 --> 00:45:40,312
TALIESIN: Could actually give you a nail clipper.
You could clip your own nails.

700
00:45:40,312 --> 00:45:45,658
MARISHA: We can get you a prosthetic little toe
that has a little compartment for poison.

701
00:45:45,658 --> 00:45:47,734
LIAM: I would take a brass claw.

702
00:45:47,734 --> 00:45:54,525
MARISHA: Or a brass claw toe. That's fun. Maybe we
could get you a raptor claw. That's cool.

703
00:45:54,914 --> 00:45:56,966
TALIESIN: Let's sleep.

704
00:45:56,966 --> 00:46:08,172
SAM: Before we go to sleep, I go over to Kima and
I say to her, Lady Kima, I think we're all going

705
00:46:08,172 --> 00:46:11,332
to take a rest and you as well, correct?

706
00:46:11,332 --> 00:46:13,859
MATT: "I think I should."

707
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:20,422
SAM: We can trust you while we're all asleep not
to do anything to any of our companions, correct?

708
00:46:20,422 --> 00:46:23,862
MATT: "If you're worried about the mind flayer,
I'll be keeping an eye, but nothing beyond that.

709
00:46:23,862 --> 00:46:32,182
"Remember: he has to make the side-step, the wrong
step, before I take any action. Trust and know

710
00:46:32,182 --> 00:46:37,720
"that if I were to strike a blow, it's at his own
poor choice and actions."

711
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:41,151
ORION: That first part of what you said rhymed.

712
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:45,195
SAM: Does she seem to be telling the truth?

713
00:46:45,195 --> 00:46:47,371
MATT: Make an insight check.

714
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:48,701
SAM: A what? What check?

715
00:46:48,701 --> 00:46:49,482
MATT: Insight.

716
00:46:49,482 --> 00:46:51,463
SAM: Insight. Okay, 18.

717
00:46:51,463 --> 00:46:53,809
MATT: She seems to be true.

718
00:46:53,809 --> 00:46:54,888
SAM: Okay.

719
00:46:54,888 --> 00:47:02,828
MATT: She is legitimately concerned about Clarota.
But also understands that at this moment, it has

720
00:47:02,828 --> 00:47:05,233
not done anything to necessarily draw her blade.

721
00:47:05,233 --> 00:47:09,704
LIAM: Lady Kima, Clarota, may I suggest you take
the first watch?

722
00:47:09,704 --> 00:47:12,957
SAM: (laughs) Oh my god, what if they start
fucking?

723
00:47:12,957 --> 00:47:17,630
(all laugh)

724
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:20,781
TALIESIN: So it's going to be that sort of
evening, excellent.

725
00:47:20,781 --> 00:47:24,367
LIAM: Rated M, for mature.

726
00:47:24,367 --> 00:47:32,831
MATT: Clarota says, "Should you insist." And
Clarota's image shimmers and vanishes.

727
00:47:32,831 --> 00:47:34,680
ORION: Sweet.

728
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,308
TALIESIN: I'm falling asleep.

729
00:47:37,308 --> 00:47:40,442
MATT: As you guys are all going to sleep, Kima's
still sharpening her sword and she stops for a

730
00:47:40,442 --> 00:47:52,430
second and goes, "Everyone, I'm sorry you've lost
your friend. If he lives, we shall find him."

731
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:55,826
LAURA: He will live.

732
00:47:55,826 --> 00:47:57,454
TALIESIN: And we will find him.

733
00:47:57,454 --> 00:48:00,477
ASHLEY: No, he will, Scanlan! You just calm down.

734
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:07,005
MATT: "But if they have indeed taken him prisoner
and Emberhold is lost, there is only one place

735
00:48:07,005 --> 00:48:11,975
"they would bring him: Yug'Voril."

736
00:48:11,975 --> 00:48:15,728
LAURA: (gasps) With the dude with the black horn.

737
00:48:15,728 --> 00:48:24,628
MATT: "Considering the mess that you've made since
entering their realm of living and work, you'd

738
00:48:24,628 --> 00:48:31,097
"make for a great gift to their current standing
demigod. If we aren't able to find him within the

739
00:48:31,097 --> 00:48:35,015
"city, I think that may be the next place to
look."

740
00:48:35,015 --> 00:48:40,816
MARISHA: Once again, are you afraid they're going
to take him while we're asleep? Is this a genuine

741
00:48:40,816 --> 00:48:43,674
concern? Is this something we should move on now?

742
00:48:43,674 --> 00:48:46,428
MATT: "Not as long as you're keeping
concentration, we should be fine."

743
00:48:46,428 --> 00:48:48,670
LAURA: I'm concentrating so hard.

744
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:50,266
(all laugh)

745
00:48:50,266 --> 00:48:52,286
LIAM: We're busted up.

746
00:48:52,376 --> 00:48:55,595
TALIESIN: There's legitimately nothing to be
done.

747
00:48:55,595 --> 00:48:59,192
MATT: There's a softness that hits Kima's face and
you can see a bit of a quiver to her chin and she

748
00:48:59,192 --> 00:49:07,263
goes, "The guilt I feel for unknowingly putting
you all in danger for my sake is immense. It's

749
00:49:07,263 --> 00:49:14,572
"because of me and my actions that you even delved
this far and nearly lost life and limb, merely at

750
00:49:14,572 --> 00:49:22,897
"the behest of Allura and... I want you all to know
that I appreciate it. I really, truly do."

751
00:49:22,897 --> 00:49:26,452
ORION: That's great. If you can mention that to
Allura, that'd be wonderful.

752
00:49:26,452 --> 00:49:29,198
MATT: "I would really appreciate it to speak to
Tiberius."

753
00:49:29,198 --> 00:49:34,948
ORION: (mumbles, makes spell sounds, returns to
normal voice) I would really appreciate it if you

754
00:49:34,948 --> 00:49:40,421
mentioned that to Allura. I'm trying to get into
her good graces and whatnot.

755
00:49:40,421 --> 00:49:45,345
MATT: She chuckles a moment and says, "All right.
Allura is a good friend. Well we've known each

756
00:49:45,345 --> 00:49:55,921
"other for... gods, 15 years now. Since we defeated
the Scourged Rider, together. But she has always

757
00:49:55,921 --> 00:50:00,739
"had more of a political mind than I do, so, when
we were both offered a seat on the council of

758
00:50:00,739 --> 00:50:08,732
"Tal'Dorei and Emon she stayed, and I... I'm a woman
of action, and I

759
00:50:08,732 --> 00:50:11,385
"knew my destiny was out in the world."

760
00:50:11,385 --> 00:50:17,727
ORION: We share something in common, Lady Kima. I,
too, have left my home and land because I did not

761
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:23,877
want to sit on the council of Draconia. With
blessings from my father and such, I gained

762
00:50:23,877 --> 00:50:27,529
ambassadorship on a mission for them, but really,
just so I could--

763
00:50:27,529 --> 00:50:29,615
MATT: Her eyes have glazed over and are staring
off into the distance.

764
00:50:29,615 --> 00:50:30,933
(all laugh)

765
00:50:30,933 --> 00:50:34,582
ORION: To get all the things out, and I saw this
wonderful lamb in this field one time--

766
00:50:34,582 --> 00:50:40,243
MATT: "I was speak to Allura of your honor and
deeds, Tiberius. We try to have drinks and swap

767
00:50:40,243 --> 00:50:43,522
"stories every few months. She's a good one."

768
00:50:43,522 --> 00:50:45,757
ORION: Yes, I think so.

769
00:50:45,757 --> 00:50:50,414
MATT: She takes a moment to herself and looks
around at the rest of you and says, "The cruel

770
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:53,681
"king. Who dealt the final blow?"

771
00:50:53,681 --> 00:51:00,690
SAM: (clears throat) That would be the
kingslayer. Me.

772
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,639
MATT: She steps up and walks over to you and puts
a hand on your shoulder and gives you a stern look

773
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:07,568
in the eye and shakes your shoulder. She's a
halfling, so she's not too much taller than you.

774
00:51:07,568 --> 00:51:08,459
(all laugh)

775
00:51:08,459 --> 00:51:10,001
SAM: (laughing) Oh, okay.

776
00:51:10,001 --> 00:51:16,150
MATT: "Good. The cruel king is down, and I thank
you for that." She walks back to the little perch

777
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:21,907
on the rock at the side of the wall and says, "He
tried to break me. Relish in his false

778
00:51:21,907 --> 00:51:28,063
"superiority. Dragging hooks across my flesh,
underestimating the will of a servant of

779
00:51:28,063 --> 00:51:30,281
"Bahamut."

780
00:51:30,281 --> 00:51:36,286
MARISHA: Are you congratulating us for being
murderers? Is that what you're doing right now?

781
00:51:36,286 --> 00:51:41,870
MATT: "Murder and justice are two entirely
different things and the deities of all good saw

782
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:45,472
"to it that this King's time was limited."

783
00:51:45,472 --> 00:51:49,530
MARISHA: Are you suggesting now that we control
the wills of the deities?

784
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:54,839
MATT: "No, but we enact them, as long as we work
within your plans to keep us safe."

785
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:59,410
MARISHA: That's mighty bold and presumptuous of
you.

786
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:06,157
MATT: "My life has been given to guidance of the
platinum dragon, who has not seen nothing but the

787
00:52:06,157 --> 00:52:11,600
"positive direction for all of your species, mine
and the rest of humanity, that exists in the

788
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:16,489
"material plane. You would do well to not
disrespect one who looks out for you, even though

789
00:52:16,489 --> 00:52:21,153
"you may not look up to him for guidance. The
reason these lands that you grew up in are safe

790
00:52:21,153 --> 00:52:27,599
"and free, as much as they are, are because of the
sacrifices of my brethren who came before me under

791

"his light and guidance. I'm not saying you to
worship him-- each one has their own gods of

00:52:31,881 --> 00:52:35,404
"choice. I just say, show some respect."

793
00:52:35,404 --> 00:52:42,403
MARISHA: I do show respect, Lady Kima. I show
respect when I feel that respect has been earned.

794
00:52:42,403 --> 00:52:45,315
ORION: She's royalty, you have to understand.

795
00:52:45,315 --> 00:52:49,751
SAM: We're all a bit cranky. Maybe we should just
turn in.

796
00:52:49,751 --> 00:52:57,835
MATT: "I watched as they executed my companions!
The wondrous men and women who came down to these

797
00:52:57,877 --> 00:53:04,173
"caverns at my sides with my coin in their pockets,
with the promise of justice. And they laughed as

798
00:53:04,173 --> 00:53:09,673
"they cut their throats before me, hoping it would
be able to crack me. It was Bahamut's strength

799
00:53:09,673 --> 00:53:11,424
"that held me there."

800
00:53:11,424 --> 00:53:18,742
MARISHA: Lady Kima, I am not saying that what we
are doing here is not just. I only wish that you

801
00:53:18,742 --> 00:53:23,256
understand-- and I humbly thank you for your
appreciation and thanks for coming down here to

802
00:53:23,256 --> 00:53:31,994
rescue you. But you are correct. We have lost a
friend. Someone who we have been through a lot

803
00:53:31,994 --> 00:53:41,232
with, way more than we have been with you. So.
Before we start boasting congratulations and you

804
00:53:41,232 --> 00:53:50,629
start thanking us, why don't you wait? And we'll
see what happens when

805
00:53:50,629 --> 00:53:52,419
we all get out of here first.

806
00:53:52,419 --> 00:53:56,001
LIAM: She's suffering from PTSD. Why are you
poking the badger?

807
00:53:56,001 --> 00:53:59,269
LAURA: Maybe we should just calm down and go to
sleep.

808
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:04,938
MATT: Kima takes a step forward towards Keyleth.
And as you look up at her face, there's a tension,

809
00:54:04,938 --> 00:54:09,371
but you can see now that she's stepped near in to
you, towards what little bit of light seems to

810
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:14,017
cascade through this cavern, there are tears
streaking down her face.

811
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,720
LAURA: How do you feel now?

812
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,934
(all laugh)

813
00:54:17,934 --> 00:54:23,738
MATT: "They tried all they could to break me, but
I knew my destiny would not end here. I have a

814
00:54:23,738 --> 00:54:25,997
"destiny that does not end here."

815
00:54:25,997 --> 00:54:28,452
ASHLEY: I reach out really slowly and give her a
handkerchief.

816
00:54:28,452 --> 00:54:30,000
(all laugh)

817
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,558
ASHLEY: And then retreat.

818
00:54:31,558 --> 00:54:35,760
TALIESIN: Lady Kima, as I'm sure you know, grief
speaks before sense.

819
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,478
MARISHA: All I'm saying, Lady Kima, is that after
what we have done and what we have been through

820
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:48,921
and the lives and the blood that even I have on my
hands, you had better be worth it.

821
00:54:48,921 --> 00:54:55,236
TALIESIN: Let us wait for talk of worth and talk
of might until we are reunited.

822
00:54:55,236 --> 00:55:04,945
MATT: She puts a hand up towards you. "Child, let
me explain to you why we are here. As while you

823
00:55:04,945 --> 00:55:10,234
"may have stepped into the pretense of keeping me
out of harm's way, there is a purpose that I and

824

"now all of us serve, here in the Underdark. Now,
I've been on this journey for more than a year,

"traveling wherever the wind took me, finding where
my gift would find an end to suffering, justice to

Allura, the same friend who brought you here."

828
00:55:34,256 --> 00:55:38,661
ORION: I pop out of my sleep. Did you say Allura
again?

829
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:39,817
MATT: "Shh."

830
00:55:39,817 --> 00:55:40,749
ORION: I'm sorry.

831
00:55:40,749 --> 00:55:41,690
LAURA: Tiberius. Shh.

832
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:46,817
MATT: "My vision came to me. I'm sure you're
familiar with visions. The great platinum dragon

833
00:55:46,817 --> 00:55:57,417
"bestowed upon my humble self a dream. I saw an
ancient vision of the great and terrible god of

unite the material world and the heart of the

"battle. Loss, far more than you or I will ever
know. The body of the avatar was burned away, but

841
00:56:49,762 --> 00:56:58,485
"the horns of Orcus remained. Untouched by flame,
blade, nor divine judgement. These keepers of the

842
00:56:58,485 --> 00:57:05,588
"horns had a title that time has taken and the
whereabouts of the artifacts that had been,

843
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:09,048
"thankfully, lost as well.

844
00:57:09,048 --> 00:57:18,726
"Until the next dream dispelled my confusion. I
felt a cackling entity of immense power, who had

845
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:27,861
"discovered one of the holding vaults, never meant
to be found. This creature obsessed, spent all

846
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:35,186
"their attention to unlock the promised treasure
within and over time, they did. One of the two

847
00:57:35,186 --> 00:57:43,882
"horns had found a new champion, one who now
resides deeper within the Underdark here. One

848
00:57:43,882 --> 00:57:51,907
"we've now known to be called K'varn. This one who
has united the illithid and the duergar alike

849
00:57:51,907 --> 00:58:00,861
"under a banner of madness, expansion, and mockery
of life. I've seen these experiments, as have you.

850
00:58:00,861 --> 00:58:08,614
"This is what I came down here to dispose of, once
and for all.

851
00:58:08,614 --> 00:58:14,015
"Now, I hired some of the finest warriors in
Kraghammer for this, all of whom have been slain

852
00:58:14,015 --> 00:58:23,894
"or worse. That guilt weighs upon my soul. And this
very quest, whoever this K'varn monstrosity, it

853
00:58:23,984 --> 00:58:29,567
"holds the horn of Orcus upon its brow. My visions
have told me that we must destroy it and must do

854
00:58:29,567 --> 00:58:35,908
"so soon. If it had already unlocked the artifact's
true potential, Kraghammer would be a ruin before

855
00:58:35,908 --> 00:58:43,947
"you even arrived. But it's only a matter of time.
We must end K'Varn and retrieve this horn and

856
00:58:43,947 --> 00:58:48,196
"return it to the Tal'Dorei council to discuss how
to seal it once more, hopefully for all of

857
00:58:48,196 --> 00:58:51,043
"eternity.

858
00:58:51,043 --> 00:58:55,422
"Your friend's loss is a terrible thing, but we
will try to find him and should we not, understand

859
00:58:55,422 --> 00:59:02,337
"that his sacrifice was not in vain. For we're here
not to save one, but thousands, hundreds of

860
00:59:02,337 --> 00:59:11,996
"thousands of lives, if we succeed. So we sleep, we
rest, we find your friend and we destroy this,

861
00:59:11,996 --> 00:59:16,427
"this abomination, this anathema."

862
00:59:18,735 --> 00:59:26,997
MARISHA: Lady Kima, I only hope you do not
eventually become what you fear so much.

863
00:59:26,997 --> 00:59:29,486
Good night.

864
00:59:29,486 --> 00:59:33,102
SAM: Sleep tight.

865
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:35,788
MATT: She picks up her blade, sits back down and
goes back to sharpening

866
00:59:35,788 --> 00:59:39,113
(sounds of a sharpening stone hitting blade).

867
00:59:39,113 --> 00:59:41,710
LAURA: That was weird, right? Good night.

868
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:45,084
TALIESIN: That went well.

869
00:59:45,084 --> 00:59:47,894
SAM: Pike, I'll cuddle you for warmth, if that
would help?

870
00:59:47,894 --> 00:59:52,327
ASHLEY: It's already so hot in here with all the
lava and stuff, I would just prefer to sleep

871
00:59:52,327 --> 00:59:53,499
alone. I'm sorry.

872
00:59:53,499 --> 00:59:56,072
SAM: That's fine. That's what I meant.

873
00:59:56,237 --> 00:59:59,740
MARISHA: I turn into Minxie form and go off in the
corner and curl up in the corner.

874
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:01,599
LIAM: Scanlan, I'm very cold.

875
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:02,656
(all laugh)

876
01:00:02,656 --> 01:00:06,155
SAM: You know what? We better let that foot heal.
We better let it heal.

877
01:00:06,155 --> 01:00:08,343
LAURA: Trinket, go sleep with Vax.

878
01:00:08,343 --> 01:00:10,820
LIAM: That's a good idea. Come here, Trinky.
Trink!

879
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:13,079
MATT: (bear sounds and sniffing)

880
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:15,856
LIAM: Who wants nibbles?

881
01:00:15,856 --> 01:00:22,147
MATT: Trinket comes up and curls next to you. The
evening goes by, uneventful. Occasionally, you

882
01:00:22,241 --> 01:00:31,265
stumble out of your rest, keep an eye out. The
beacon still resides. From what you can imagine, a

883
01:00:31,265 --> 01:00:35,576
natural body sleep cycle that you're used to
passes. A few begin to wake up before the others,

884
01:00:35,576 --> 01:00:39,581
as you have no daylight to ascertain whether it is
day or night. Indeed,

885
01:00:39,581 --> 01:00:41,662
who knows what it is at this point.

886
01:00:41,662 --> 01:00:43,780
ORION: I relieved myself in the middle of the
night.

887
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:45,238
LAURA: Thank you for telling us, Tiberius.

888
01:00:45,238 --> 01:00:46,793
SAM: Did you get up?

889
01:00:46,793 --> 01:00:48,739
MATT: Just wake up in a puddle of his own
dragonborn filth?

890
01:00:48,739 --> 01:00:51,847
ORION: I did my dragonborn business and buried it.
As we do.

891
01:00:51,847 --> 01:00:53,751
LAURA: So have we healed completely?

892
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:56,235
MATT: Yes, you've all healed completely at this
point. You had an evening's rest.

893
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:57,396
SAM: Do we get all our spells back and stuff?

894
01:00:57,396 --> 01:00:58,527
MATT: You get your spells back.

895
01:00:58,527 --> 01:00:59,919
MARISHA: We have to pick them for the day, right?

896
01:00:59,919 --> 01:01:04,794
SAM: I can do things again.

897
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:07,161
MARISHA: Yeah, hang on, got to think about this.

898
01:01:07,161 --> 01:01:08,956
ORION: Put some Greater Restorations in there.

899
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:12,836
MATT: Your mark? Wait, your mark, your Hunter's
Mark, which you can feel, the magic of it is

900
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:17,926
slowly waning as the spell comes to the end of its
effective period, is moving.

901
01:01:17,926 --> 01:01:19,200
LAURA: (gasps) Where's it moving?

902
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,398
MATT: It's moving out of the city.

903
01:01:21,398 --> 01:01:23,950
LAURA: Where, which direction?

904
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:28,021
MATT: Best you can tell, it's heading towards the
opposite side of the cavern towards where it

905
01:01:28,021 --> 01:01:32,217
curves down, deeper and below.

906
01:01:32,217 --> 01:01:35,939
LAURA: Wait. Where is that in relation to us?

907
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:40,196
MATT: To where you guys are? If you're looking out
from next to the Emberhold, it's to your right,

908
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,328
curving down and around.

909
01:01:42,328 --> 01:01:46,142
LAURA: We should go that direction.

910
01:01:46,142 --> 01:01:48,968
MARISHA: I go and cast Pass Without a Trace on us.

911
01:01:48,968 --> 01:01:50,507
MATT: All right.

912
01:01:50,507 --> 01:01:54,166
LIAM: This is suddenly turning into Labyrinth.
"Beyond the Goblin city..."

913
01:01:54,166 --> 01:01:57,210
MATT: To take back the child, which you have
stolen.

914
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:59,454
LAURA: You have no power over me.

915
01:01:59,454 --> 01:02:02,553
SAM: The way we came in the city was through the
side path, right?

916
01:02:02,553 --> 01:02:08,258
MATT: Yes, the side of Emberhold, which you
followed the curvature of this giant cavern around

917
01:02:08,258 --> 01:02:11,676
and you slept on the side, up against the wall,
using the illusion, the illusory terrain.

918
01:02:11,676 --> 01:02:13,378
SAM: So we're already--

919
01:02:13,378 --> 01:02:16,726
MATT: You're already away from Emberhold, you're
on the side of the wall, maybe about a quarter to

920
01:02:16,726 --> 01:02:18,095
a half a mile further down.

921
01:02:18,095 --> 01:02:19,516
SAM: But if we keep going, we'll get to the--

922
01:02:19,516 --> 01:02:22,387
MATT: You'll head down further into the cavern,
seemingly in the direction where her Hunter's Mark

923
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:25,951
is currently leading, which has now faded.

924
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:28,245
SAM: Okay! Your Hunter's Mark is gone.

925
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:30,354
LAURA: Well, it went that way. We should go.

926
01:02:30,354 --> 01:02:32,116
SAM: So, let's go. Let's just hurry.

927
01:02:32,116 --> 01:02:36,040
LAURA: As stealthily as possible so we don't alert
the entire freaking camp.

928
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,466
TALIESIN: We've got Pass Without a Trace, so we
should be all right.

929
01:02:38,466 --> 01:02:41,850
MATT: All right.

930
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:46,185
LAURA: I try to make it look like we weren't
around this area as much as possible without our

931
01:02:46,185 --> 01:02:48,646
Dust of Tracelessness.

932
01:02:48,646 --> 01:02:54,224
MATT: You're sweeping behind the group as they're
all moving along. With your imaginary brush.

933
01:02:54,224 --> 01:02:57,275
LIAM: Trinket's doing that thing where he pulls
with his front feet and drags with his behind.

934
01:02:57,275 --> 01:02:59,997
TALIESIN: He's just rolling like a giant brillo
brush.

935
01:02:59,997 --> 01:03:05,723
MARISHA: I put Stone Shape in my Ring of Holding
last night with my unused spells. I meant to tell

936
01:03:05,723 --> 01:03:07,028
you that last night.

937
01:03:07,028 --> 01:03:08,370
MATT: That's all right. All right, you do that.

938
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:10,414
ASHLEY: Oh, I forgot you had that ring.

939
01:03:10,414 --> 01:03:13,113
MATT: All right, so.

940
01:03:13,113 --> 01:03:15,638
ORION: I take out my Ioun Stones.

941
01:03:15,638 --> 01:03:21,065
MATT: Okay, so your Ioun Stones are now slowly
rotating around your head. Well, you can only have

942
01:03:21,065 --> 01:03:23,263
one up at a time.

943
01:03:23,263 --> 01:03:24,400
ORION: Well, I only have one.

944
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,005
MATT: Yeah, okay, good. You said stones, so.

945
01:03:26,005 --> 01:03:28,413
ORION: Sorry. Pathfinder habit.

946
01:03:28,413 --> 01:03:32,434
MATT: I know. So moving around your head slowly.
All right, so the rest of you gather, you cast

947
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:40,259
your spell Pass Without a Trace. You continue to
crest along the outskirts of the cavern wall at

948
01:03:40,259 --> 01:03:48,909
this point. Looking over, you can see, throughout
the night, most of the fortress, currently-- the

949
01:03:48,909 --> 01:03:54,026
lava fall that once contained it is completely
cooled and is dark. It looks like their way of

950
01:03:54,026 --> 01:03:59,909
stopping the flow was to stop the entire magma
fall. Who knows how much damage has been done, but

951
01:03:59,909 --> 01:04:04,657
currently the flow is halted and you can see now,
there's a number of parties of duergar that are

952
01:04:04,657 --> 01:04:09,428
wandering out, through the cavern, presumably in
search for you.

953
01:04:09,481 --> 01:04:17,207
LAURA: So technically, Lady Kima, we might be able
to get back in eventually and get your weapon.

954
01:04:17,207 --> 01:04:22,086
MATT: As you say that, she grins to herself and
says, "I would like that very much. I had some

955
01:04:22,086 --> 01:04:24,187
"sentimental value to that equipment."

956
01:04:24,187 --> 01:04:25,676
LAURA: And there's a vault.

957
01:04:25,676 --> 01:04:27,684
MATT: "And there is a vault."

958
01:04:27,684 --> 01:04:30,023
SAM: Unless it melted.

959
01:04:30,023 --> 01:04:35,629
LIAM: This will greatly enhance your ability to
move forward with us, won't it?

960
01:04:35,629 --> 01:04:39,398
MATT: "I think right now time is of the essence
for your friend more than anything."

961
01:04:39,398 --> 01:04:42,580
LAURA: We should go look for Grog.

962
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:45,967
MATT: "Besides, I highly doubt that that
stronghold has been left alone, just because it's

963
01:04:45,967 --> 01:04:47,347
"filled with rock."

964
01:04:47,347 --> 01:04:50,057
LIAM: Maybe on the way out.

965
01:04:50,057 --> 01:04:51,964
MATT: Okay, so as you guys progress on the side, I
would like everybody to roll

966
01:04:51,964 --> 01:04:54,506
a stealth check, please.

967
01:04:54,506 --> 01:04:56,163
LAURA: Oh, I don't know which one to roll.

968
01:04:56,163 --> 01:04:58,230
MATT: You still have disadvantage, but you have
advantage with your cloak, so you're neutralized.

969
01:04:58,230 --> 01:04:59,412
You're a normal roll right now.

970
01:04:59,412 --> 01:05:00,395
MARISHA: (softly) Stealth check.

971
01:05:00,395 --> 01:05:01,331
ASHLEY: We have advantage?

972
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:02,198
MARISHA: You have plus ten.

973
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:03,408
MATT: No, you have disadvantage still.

974
01:05:03,408 --> 01:05:05,200
ASHLEY: I do not. There's no plus anything?

975
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,302
SAM: Plus ten.

976
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:07,269
ASHLEY: Ten still?

977
01:05:07,269 --> 01:05:08,192
ORION: 29.

978
01:05:08,192 --> 01:05:09,031
LIAM: Plus ten?

979
01:05:09,031 --> 01:05:10,069
MATT: Plus ten.

980
01:05:10,069 --> 01:05:11,574
ORION: 29.

981
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:12,396
SAM: 19.

982
01:05:12,396 --> 01:05:13,297
MARISHA: 33.

983
01:05:13,297 --> 01:05:14,757
TALIESIN: 17.

984
01:05:14,757 --> 01:05:15,707
ASHLEY: 21.

985
01:05:15,707 --> 01:05:16,572
LAURA: 24.

986
01:05:16,572 --> 01:05:17,737
LIAM: 33.

987
01:05:17,737 --> 01:05:19,558
LAURA: Oh, I didn't roll for Trinket. Hold on.

988
01:05:19,558 --> 01:05:27,645
LIAM: Oh, Trinket rolled a one.

989
01:05:27,645 --> 01:05:32,956
LAURA: Trinket, shush. Oh, I didn't feed him
today, he's probably so hungry.

990
01:05:32,956 --> 01:05:35,434
SAM: Have any of us eaten?

991
01:05:35,434 --> 01:05:36,693
ASHLEY: We've rested.

992
01:05:36,693 --> 01:05:40,068
MATT: Essentially, as opposed to having this
minutiae of reminding you all to eat, I just

993
01:05:40,068 --> 01:05:44,442
consider when you rest and take short rests,
you're snacking and resting. Otherwise, we

994
01:05:44,442 --> 01:05:50,663
communally spend ten minutes a game talking about
what you ate. If food begins to become

995
01:05:50,663 --> 01:05:55,473
scarce, which it may in time, I'll let you know.

996
01:05:55,605 --> 01:06:00,134
LIAM: Foot flakes anyone? Foot flakes?

997
01:06:00,134 --> 01:06:06,742
MATT: It's like pork rinds (chuckles). All right.
So, as you continue down this cavern, you begin to

998
01:06:06,742 --> 01:06:11,823
see the search parties in the distance and you
keep low and watch as they pass. Some of them have

999
01:06:11,823 --> 01:06:22,389
small, that red glowish stone torches set out to
keep their vision about. You can see a few of the

1000
01:06:22,389 --> 01:06:27,854
parties returning to the city. Eventually, you
guys begin to crest down deeper and dropping into

1001
01:06:27,854 --> 01:06:34,743
a small decline as this giant, almost hatchback
cavern where most of the duergar civilization is

1002
01:06:34,743 --> 01:06:41,951
built in comes to an end. You begin to travel
deeper, deeper into the Underdark caverns below. As

1003
01:06:41,991 --> 01:06:51,879
you're continuing forward, you find a very very
familiar scent catches your attention immediately,

1004
01:06:51,879 --> 01:06:55,948
as you're tracking through, trying to keep your
attention on possibly any sign of Grog. It's the

1005
01:06:55,948 --> 01:07:01,699
smell of blood. It's the smell of fresh blood.
Fresh-ish.

1006
01:07:01,699 --> 01:07:03,002
LAURA: Fresh-ish?

1007
01:07:03,002 --> 01:07:09,243
MATT: Fresh-ish blood, if you will. You smell
fresh-ish blood. You immediately glance over and

1008
01:07:09,243 --> 01:07:16,547
you can see on the side of this cavern, which is
about 50, 60 feet wide at this point, as it's come

1009
01:07:16,547 --> 01:07:22,526
to a pinching point leading downward, you can see
a spatter of blood across the wall to your

1010
01:07:22,526 --> 01:07:28,026
immediate left, and what looks like a mangled mass
of what once was a duergar, currently just torn

1011
01:07:28,026 --> 01:07:30,037
asunder across this rock wall.

1012
01:07:30,037 --> 01:07:31,143
LAURA: Oh no.

1013
01:07:31,143 --> 01:07:36,032
MARISHA: Does it look to be natural, done by an
animal? Or does it look like people with weapons?

1014
01:07:36,032 --> 01:07:37,519
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

1015
01:07:37,519 --> 01:07:42,040
LAURA: The only time I've seen duergar split
across like this was when we saw the camp of that

1016
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,736
creepy centipede creature.

1017
01:07:44,736 --> 01:07:46,551
LIAM: With the stalagmite coming up?

1018
01:07:46,551 --> 01:07:47,552
LAURA: Yeah.

1019
01:07:47,552 --> 01:07:48,354
MARISHA: Ten.

1020
01:07:48,354 --> 01:07:50,234
LAURA: Do I see any of those kind of tracks
around?

1021
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:52,846
MATT: You check and look around on the ground as
well, you unfortunately, as you look around,

1022
01:07:52,846 --> 01:07:59,540
you're not able to pick up the fine details. You,
however, just being naturally understanding of the

1023
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:04,174
Underdark, as well as having the previous
knowledge of inspecting the initial camp: yes,

1024
01:08:04,174 --> 01:08:08,137
these tracks are very similar. You see what looks
like these strange dragging marks on the ground,

1025
01:08:08,137 --> 01:08:13,085
these elongated ones. No footprints. Occasionally
you see what looks like a human-sized footprint as

1026
01:08:13,085 --> 01:08:20,029
well, and then these drag marks. You also notice
that there is just beyond the rock threshold, as

1027
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:24,852
you step over towards the wall, you see three
other duergar bodies that are torn asunder. Many

1028
01:08:24,852 --> 01:08:34,566
of them partially eaten and violently torn apart.
Some parts are scarred, some sort of acidic burn,

1029
01:08:34,622 --> 01:08:40,879
and you see tooth marks, you see claw marks and
you see portions of limbs that have been pulled

1030
01:08:40,879 --> 01:08:42,618
off by sheer force.

1031
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:45,500
MARISHA: Could I do a nature check to see if I
would know of a creature that could do this?

1032
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,654
MATT: You certainly can.

1033
01:08:47,654 --> 01:08:50,088
LAURA: It's going to be that centipede creature
thingy.

1034
01:08:50,088 --> 01:08:52,138
MARISHA: Ooh. 26.

1035
01:08:52,138 --> 01:09:00,715
MATT: 26. It's weird. There are elements of the
drag marks on the ground that resemble a creature

1036
01:09:00,715 --> 01:09:09,911
that has pseudopods or some sort of a
tentacle-like mass, but you know of no natural

1037
01:09:09,911 --> 01:09:17,402
creature that also has this power, this type of
hunting technique, nor would be this far

1038
01:09:17,402 --> 01:09:18,705
underground.

1039
01:09:18,705 --> 01:09:20,245
TALIESIN: I think it's another stitch monster.

1040
01:09:20,245 --> 01:09:20,905
LIAM: Yes.

1041
01:09:20,905 --> 01:09:21,974
LAURA: Stitch monster.

1042
01:09:21,974 --> 01:09:22,893
TALIESIN: Stitch monster.

1043
01:09:22,893 --> 01:09:23,692
LAURA: I like it.

1044
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:24,531
TALIESIN: I do, too.

1045
01:09:24,531 --> 01:09:25,542
LAURA: It's a good name.

1046
01:09:25,542 --> 01:09:28,206
MARISHA: Something tentacle-y though. Nothing ever
good is tentacle-y.

1047
01:09:28,206 --> 01:09:34,611
LAURA: Can I tell if Grog definitely came this
way?

1048
01:09:34,611 --> 01:09:41,119
MATT: Go ahead and make a tracking check, so just
go ahead and roll a d20. You have advantage,

1049
01:09:41,119 --> 01:09:43,998
because you're in the Underdark.

1050
01:09:43,998 --> 01:09:46,168
LAURA: What do I add that to?

1051
01:09:46,168 --> 01:09:50,267
MATT: It should be under your tracking ability
under your ranger abilities there.

1052
01:09:50,318 --> 01:09:54,733
In your spells, under you ranger abilities.
I'll see if I find it before you.

1053
01:09:54,733 --> 01:09:55,990
LAURA: I don't understand.

1054
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:57,360
MATT: It's on the sheet I gave you, with all your
character stuff.

1055
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,439
LAURA: Oh. Okay, cool.

1056
01:09:58,439 --> 01:10:02,661
MATT: That one. The one that's easiest.

1057
01:10:02,661 --> 01:10:10,342
LAURA: Natural explorer, primeval awareness.

1058
01:10:10,342 --> 01:10:11,286
MATT: Okay.

1059
01:10:11,286 --> 01:10:13,103
LAURA: I don't have any idea what I'm looking for.

1060
01:10:13,103 --> 01:10:14,968
(all laugh)

1061
01:10:14,968 --> 01:10:16,340
LAURA: I'm just looking at words right now.

1062
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:17,495
MATT: It's a survival check. There you go.

1063
01:10:17,495 --> 01:10:18,940
LAURA: It's a survival check.

1064
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:20,490
MATT: You have advantage on it.

1065
01:10:20,490 --> 01:10:25,663
LAURA: Okay. Oh, good. So that's 22.

1066
01:10:25,663 --> 01:10:33,995
MATT: 22. All right. Looking around, what you do
find is, there is a very familiar scent that a

1067
01:10:33,995 --> 01:10:40,016
goliath barbarian does have. You, using Trinket's
help, as you yourself are not quite as attuned,

1068
01:10:40,016 --> 01:10:46,156
Trinket does pick up a little bit of Grog's scent
in this pathway. So Trinket (moans) gives you a

1069
01:10:46,156 --> 01:10:51,973
nudge and points deeper down the cavern. And you
can see what looks to be a smattering of small

1070
01:10:51,973 --> 01:10:58,522
duergar-sized feet and two grooves.

1071
01:10:58,522 --> 01:10:59,615
LAURA: Two grooves?

1072
01:10:59,615 --> 01:11:01,900
MATT: About two-inch-wide grooves that continue
down the path.

1073
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:06,305
LAURA: I wonder if they have him prisoner now. If
he came out of his mind funk.

1074
01:11:06,305 --> 01:11:08,223
MARISHA: Wheel tracks?

1075
01:11:08,223 --> 01:11:10,679
MATT: It could very well be wheel tracks.

1076
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:13,558
ORION: Or they're dragging his body.

1077
01:11:13,558 --> 01:11:15,677
MATT: They're consistent and their width is
consistent.

1078
01:11:15,677 --> 01:11:17,984
MARISHA: Their width is consistent? And they seem
clean?

1079
01:11:17,984 --> 01:11:19,615
SAM: They've put him on some sort of stretcher
thing.

1080
01:11:19,615 --> 01:11:22,577
MARISHA: Yeah, sounds like they have him on, yeah,
a trailer.

1081
01:11:22,577 --> 01:11:30,099
LAURA: Lovely. Well, Grog definitely came this
way. As did the stitch monster, so you don't have

1082
01:11:30,099 --> 01:11:32,927
much choice but to follow.

1083
01:11:32,927 --> 01:11:34,119
TALIESIN: Let's continue.

1084
01:11:34,119 --> 01:11:35,522
ORION: Shall we?

1085
01:11:35,522 --> 01:11:36,896
TALIESIN: All right.

1086
01:11:36,896 --> 01:11:40,463
LAURA: Be aware. We're all very aware of--

1087
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:41,875
MARISHA: Things.

1088
01:11:41,875 --> 01:11:44,977
LAURA: Any movement at all... happening.

1089
01:11:44,977 --> 01:11:47,377
TALIESIN: Guys, stuff.

1090
01:11:47,377 --> 01:11:53,715
MATT: Keeping your eyes peeled, you travel for
another two and a half hours down this cavern

1091
01:11:53,715 --> 01:11:59,241
path. It grows tighter at points where you can
only really fit three or four individuals through,

1092
01:11:59,241 --> 01:12:03,251
it's about 20, 25 feet wide, then opens up
sporadically into other small pockets, where the

1093
01:12:03,251 --> 01:12:09,594
natural topography of this portion of this
Underdark cavern structure seems to weave and

1094
01:12:09,594 --> 01:12:16,589
bend. The warmth and that sulfurous smell that was
intrinsic to the duergar portion of this cavern

1095
01:12:16,589 --> 01:12:21,118
that you were so used to, begins to slowly fade
and temperature begins to drop. Still

1096
01:12:21,118 --> 01:12:24,770
uncomfortable, but it's growing more humid as
opposed to dry heat.

1097
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:28,910
ORION: It's so good.

1098
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:32,751
MATT: After another hour of travel, keeping your
eyes out, the temperature drops significantly and

1099
01:12:32,751 --> 01:12:38,974
is actually quite cold. The heat in the volcanic
portion of this cavern structure apparently has

1100
01:12:38,974 --> 01:12:45,924
passed you now, and you've hit an area of the rock
where it is a much more chilled, much more

1101
01:12:45,924 --> 01:12:48,302
ominous--

1102
01:12:48,302 --> 01:12:50,605
ORION: It's humid still?

1103
01:12:50,605 --> 01:12:51,656
MATT: Human?

1104
01:12:51,656 --> 01:12:52,722
ORION: Humid.

1105
01:12:52,722 --> 01:12:55,285
MATT: Humid? The humidity begins to fade as well.
The air becomes a dry cold.

1106
01:12:55,285 --> 01:12:58,456
ORION: So we're past that.

1107
01:12:58,456 --> 01:13:05,464
MATT: You eventually using, which by the way the
only light source you have going forward is the

1108
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:07,099
light from your staff.

1109
01:13:07,099 --> 01:13:08,528
ORION: Oh, Light!

1110
01:13:08,528 --> 01:13:10,806
MATT: I assume you've had it up this whole time or
you've been walking in the darkness.

1111
01:13:10,806 --> 01:13:12,416
ORION: Oh, yes, of course.

1112
01:13:12,416 --> 01:13:20,247
MATT: (chuckles) You continue down and the
topography, which was once the black, jagged

1113
01:13:20,247 --> 01:13:25,549
obsidian flooring of the previous portion of the
Underdark, begins to give way to a more natural

1114
01:13:25,549 --> 01:13:31,721
gray sand-type texture. Your feet sink about a
quarter inch or so with each step, and you get

1115
01:13:31,721 --> 01:13:37,199
about ten, 15 feet before the color of the sand
and the texture changes dramatically. It looks

1116
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:46,487
almost like a peppering of small whitish-yellow
stones and rocks, as well as bits of black and

1117
01:13:46,487 --> 01:13:55,205
grey. It's like a giant, rocky pit out in front of
you.

1118
01:13:55,205 --> 01:13:57,887
MARISHA: What?

1119
01:13:57,887 --> 01:14:03,375
LIAM: Meaning it's all solid stone that color or
loose gravel and rock?

1120
01:14:03,375 --> 01:14:07,095
MATT: You find sand and then the sand eventually
gives way to like larger pieces of these rocks and

1121
01:14:07,095 --> 01:14:08,264
stones.

1122
01:14:08,264 --> 01:14:09,854
MARISHA: So it's like a pebble ball pit in front
of us?

1123
01:14:09,854 --> 01:14:11,463
MATT: Essentially.

1124
01:14:11,463 --> 01:14:13,825
TALIESIN: I'm looking for signs of mining.

1125
01:14:13,825 --> 01:14:17,138
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make an investigation
check.

1126
01:14:17,138 --> 01:14:18,948
ORION: I'm going to make an arcana check, also.

1127
01:14:18,948 --> 01:14:20,278
TALIESIN: 15.

1128
01:14:20,278 --> 01:14:25,033
MATT: 15. Checking the walls immediately in your
vicinity, you see there are signs of mining, but

1129
01:14:25,033 --> 01:14:29,167
they're old, they haven't been used in a while.
You can see some veins that are dried up. Looks

1130
01:14:29,167 --> 01:14:31,621
like maybe the duergar had business down here
mining.

1131
01:14:31,621 --> 01:14:36,130
MARISHA: Does it look like there-- Can I do a
nature check to see if this is an old lake bed?

1132
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:38,022
Like there is a river bed?

1133
01:14:38,022 --> 01:14:39,507
MATT: Sure, go and do that. What did you roll?

1134
01:14:39,507 --> 01:14:40,314
ORION: 11.

1135
01:14:40,314 --> 01:14:41,201
MATT: What are you checking?

1136
01:14:41,201 --> 01:14:41,964
ORION: For arcana.

1137
01:14:41,964 --> 01:14:42,691
MATT: What are you checking?

1138
01:14:42,691 --> 01:14:47,520
ORION: Just general, if I feel a general source of
sinister magic anywhere.

1139
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,352
MATT: Nothing arcane seems to emanate from the
vicinity.

1140
01:14:51,352 --> 01:14:56,121
LIAM: Vex'ahlia, you know the Underdark. Are there
any critters crawling around in that pit?

1141
01:14:56,121 --> 01:14:58,406
LAURA: Is this still the Underdark?

1142
01:14:58,406 --> 01:15:02,306
MATT: You seem to be still in the Underdark, but
the Underdark in general you're familiar with;

1143
01:15:02,306 --> 01:15:08,688
your training and studying on the denizens of it,
what things to look for. This is not a natural or

1144
01:15:08,688 --> 01:15:12,214
overall occurrence you've read about before.

1145
01:15:12,214 --> 01:15:13,973
LAURA: I can't sense anything or any creatures
nearby?

1146
01:15:13,973 --> 01:15:14,922
MATT: Not per se.

1147
01:15:14,922 --> 01:15:15,906
MARISHA: I rolled a 16.

1148
01:15:15,906 --> 01:15:22,000
MATT: Rolled a 16? As you're looking around, you
go and inspect the stones. What you do notice is,

1149
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:29,553
they're not stones. There are pieces of glass,
little shards of actual volcanic glass scattered

1150
01:15:29,553 --> 01:15:37,081
across this entire field mixed with an endless
seemingly sea of small bone chunks.

1151
01:15:37,081 --> 01:15:38,854
LAURA: Ugh!

1152
01:15:38,854 --> 01:15:39,993
MARISHA: Chunks?

1153
01:15:39,993 --> 01:15:41,029
LAURA: Great!

1154
01:15:41,029 --> 01:15:43,252
MATT: Pieces of bone that have been rounded off,
ground, broken.

1155
01:15:43,252 --> 01:15:44,626
ORION: Bone petals.

1156
01:15:44,626 --> 01:15:45,958
MATT: They're ancient.

1157
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:51,171
MARISHA: Okay, so there appears to be-- are there
any whole pieces of bones? Big femurs or skulls?

1158
01:15:51,171 --> 01:15:53,080
SAM: This was some sort of burial ground.

1159
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:56,374
MATT: It's hard to see. Most of the bones that
have been here, have been around long enough to

1160
01:15:56,374 --> 01:16:00,261
the point where they've eroded, been broken,
destroyed over and over again to the point where

1161
01:16:00,261 --> 01:16:06,458
you can't discern any of the original creatures
they may have come from. It's just a sea of bone,

1162
01:16:06,458 --> 01:16:11,331
obsidian glass, and small bits of stone that have
fallen from the actual nearby cavern.

1163
01:16:11,331 --> 01:16:18,525
LIAM: Can we see any sort of civilized
construction here? Or is this all the work of

1164
01:16:18,525 --> 01:16:22,415
nature or some living thing?

1165
01:16:22,415 --> 01:16:24,771
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

1166
01:16:24,771 --> 01:16:29,998
LIAM: 18.

1167
01:16:29,998 --> 01:16:35,565
MATT: 18? You look past the barrier of his light
spell, because you can only get a little bit past

1168
01:16:35,565 --> 01:16:42,447
that due to your elven low-light vision. You do
notice there are occasionally some spires of

1169
01:16:42,447 --> 01:16:46,416
natural rock, some stalagmites that are jutting
out in the distance, and you see what looks like

1170
01:16:46,416 --> 01:16:55,025
some semblance of a ruined wall just beyond the
edge of the vision. Like a crumbled, small wall.

1171
01:16:55,025 --> 01:17:06,684
LAURA: Can I use my primeval awareness and see if
I can sense Grog within six miles of us?

1172
01:17:06,684 --> 01:17:11,553
MATT: Certainly. All right, so how does your
primeval awareness work, miss ranger?

1173
01:17:11,553 --> 01:17:16,992
LAURA: Oh, I can use an action to focus my
awareness on a region around me and then I can

1174
01:17:16,992 --> 01:17:21,910
sense whether-- oh, well, no. It's only certain
types of creatures.

1175
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:23,438
MATT: Right. Which are?

1176
01:17:23,438 --> 01:17:25,137
LIAM: Like goliath?

1177
01:17:25,137 --> 01:17:31,899
LAURA: Well, no. It says "aberrations, celestials,
dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead".

1178
01:17:31,899 --> 01:17:35,289
LIAM: That still might be useful, even if it
doesn't find Grog.

1179
01:17:35,289 --> 01:17:44,416
MATT: What you do gather, you do sense a very
strong force of aberration-based, much further,

1180
01:17:44,416 --> 01:17:51,419
like five miles ahead, way ahead, and you have
this weird, "Okay, good to know." You don't sense

1181
01:17:51,419 --> 01:17:57,393
anything else, but you do sense a general presence
about this entire sea of bone.

1182
01:17:57,393 --> 01:17:59,419
ASHLEY: I've been here!

1183
01:17:59,419 --> 01:18:00,241
MARISHA: What?!

1184
01:18:00,241 --> 01:18:01,774
ASHLEY: I was here in the vision.

1185
01:18:01,774 --> 01:18:02,710
LAURA: Really?

1186
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:10,007
ASHLEY: Yes, it was a field of broken glass and
bone, and I feel like this is it.

1187
01:18:10,007 --> 01:18:11,543
LAURA: So what do we do?

1188
01:18:11,543 --> 01:18:16,169
ASHLEY: And then after that, I got to a cavern of
blue crystal.

1189
01:18:16,169 --> 01:18:20,157
LAURA: So we have to go beyond it.

1190
01:18:20,157 --> 01:18:21,668
MARISHA: So we're on the right road.

1191
01:18:21,668 --> 01:18:23,089
ASHLEY: I think we have to go beyond this.

1192
01:18:23,089 --> 01:18:23,992
TALIESIN: All right.

1193
01:18:23,992 --> 01:18:25,019
ORION: Well, let's keep moving, then.

1194
01:18:25,019 --> 01:18:27,549
LAURA: Can we keep to the edge and try to not
disturb the rock as much as possible.

1195
01:18:27,549 --> 01:18:32,662
MATT: As you move to either edge, you can see the
wall comes to a straight meeting with this. Aside

1196
01:18:32,662 --> 01:18:37,687
from the climbing the walls proper, you have no
other way of traversing this.

1197
01:18:37,687 --> 01:18:39,666
LIAM: Could you describe the dimensions of this
one more time?

1198
01:18:39,666 --> 01:18:48,502
MATT: Yes. The cavern itself is about 120 to 150
feet wide. You don't see the ceiling right now.

1199
01:18:48,502 --> 01:18:50,723
LAURA: Oh, it's that high?

1200
01:18:50,723 --> 01:18:52,571
LIAM: So, from our left to our right, 150 feet?

1201
01:18:52,571 --> 01:18:53,701
MATT: Correct.

1202
01:18:53,701 --> 01:18:55,846
LIAM: And is it a big circular shape?

1203
01:18:55,846 --> 01:19:00,214
MATT: From what you can tell, it just opens up and
then continues and then darkness. You cannot see

1204
01:19:00,214 --> 01:19:01,097
beyond it.

1205
01:19:01,097 --> 01:19:03,251
LAURA: Are there any rocks around us? Any big
rocks?

1206
01:19:03,386 --> 01:19:06,956
MATT: There are a couple of small spires about
60, 70 feet out.

1207
01:19:07,012 --> 01:19:09,567
LAURA: Anything loose? Anything I can grab near
us?

1208
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:13,038
MATT: Around you? Most everything that's grabbable
are part of it, yeah.

1209
01:19:13,038 --> 01:19:17,220
ASHLEY: We don't have the magic carpet. So never
mind.

1210
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:19,461
SAM: What, do you want to fly?

1211
01:19:19,461 --> 01:19:21,370
LIAM: I say we take a wall.

1212
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:23,897
TALIESIN: Say we just gingerly try and cross
against a wall.

1213
01:19:23,897 --> 01:19:30,059
LAURA: Yeah. Anything to throw as far as I can out
and see if it--

1214
01:19:30,059 --> 01:19:32,245
MATT: You look around and find a small pebble, and
you chuck it (sound of pebble flying through air

1215
01:19:32,245 --> 01:19:36,352
and landing) It arcs around, bounces a bit, and
comes to rest.

1216
01:19:36,352 --> 01:19:39,834
SAM: Let's just go.

1217
01:19:39,834 --> 01:19:44,976
MARISHA: No! No, I'm not touching that. Nope.

1218
01:19:44,976 --> 01:19:46,814
SAM: What are we going to do? Turn around? Grog's
that way.

1219
01:19:46,814 --> 01:19:50,811
MARISHA: Okay, here's my idea. We've got that
immovable rod.

1220
01:19:50,811 --> 01:19:56,555
ORION: Yes, I know where you're going with this,
and we'd all have to make a certain--

1221
01:19:56,555 --> 01:20:00,375
MATT: Once again, there's something about this
whole area, there's a presence about it. It's

1222
01:20:00,375 --> 01:20:03,571
ominous, and everywhere about this floor.

1223
01:20:03,571 --> 01:20:08,262
MARISHA: I don't want to touch this. I feel like
we should go over it.

1224
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:10,099
ASHLEY: What if these bones come to life?

1225
01:20:10,099 --> 01:20:14,097
LAURA: Can you send your light source up? Can
anybody send light up and see

1226
01:20:14,097 --> 01:20:15,608
how high the ceiling goes?

1227
01:20:15,608 --> 01:20:21,355
ORION: (mumbles) Shoot an arrow, if you would,
Vex, please? Wherever you wish.

1228
01:20:21,355 --> 01:20:22,840
LAURA: Okay.

1229
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:24,406
ORION: Light!

1230
01:20:24,406 --> 01:20:28,379
MATT: Okay, cast out an arrow. As it shoots over,
arcs through the air. You get a look of the

1231
01:20:28,379 --> 01:20:35,093
cavern. You can see it's a large, arched, natural
cavern with a number of hanging stalactites at the

1232
01:20:35,093 --> 01:20:44,374
top. It goes up, arcs past, and then lands
probably about a half a mile down the way. Really

1233
01:20:44,374 --> 01:20:45,434
nice shot.

1234
01:20:45,434 --> 01:20:46,995
LAURA: Thanks.

1235
01:20:46,995 --> 01:20:51,319
MATT: And it lands with a (impact noise). With
what little bit you can see through the arc, this

1236
01:20:51,319 --> 01:20:55,424
path just continues and continues and continues
for that full half mile.

1237
01:20:55,424 --> 01:20:56,894
LAURA: There's no way to avoid it.

1238
01:20:56,894 --> 01:20:58,195
MARISHA: There's no way to avoid it.

1239
01:20:58,195 --> 01:21:01,288
MATT: You do get a nice view of what looks to be
more of these little, central pieces of broken

1240
01:21:01,288 --> 01:21:08,733
wall. Looks like there was either a small series
of structures or buildings that were built once

1241
01:21:08,733 --> 01:21:13,244
within this cavern that have all completely
crumbled to ruin with but a few small bastions of

1242
01:21:13,244 --> 01:21:14,846
foundation that still remain.

1243
01:21:14,846 --> 01:21:20,599
LAURA: Tiberius, how many times can you cast
pillars of... whatever? Pillars.

1244
01:21:20,599 --> 01:21:23,521
ORION: Grand Columns is the spell, Vex.

1245
01:21:23,521 --> 01:21:25,945
LAURA: How many times can you cast Grand Columns?

1246
01:21:25,945 --> 01:21:29,464
ORION: Multiple times, I guess.

1247
01:21:29,464 --> 01:21:35,545
LAURA: Could we potentially walk on columns across
this thing? Potentially.

1248
01:21:35,545 --> 01:21:41,581
MARISHA: I mean, I could wall of-- bend us a stone
wall that's and we could just walk along the path.

1249
01:21:41,581 --> 01:21:44,861
But it goes only so far.

1250
01:21:44,861 --> 01:21:47,368
ORION: Hold on a second. I've got something here.

1251
01:21:47,368 --> 01:21:51,792
LIAM: We're seeing the remains of buildings
scattered throughout, maybe we could go from--

1252
01:21:51,792 --> 01:21:54,756
LAURA: What about a wall from out from the side?

1253
01:21:54,756 --> 01:21:56,225
MARISHA: The side? And then we walk along that
side?

1254
01:21:56,225 --> 01:21:57,399
LAURA: Yeah!

1255
01:21:57,399 --> 01:21:59,258
MARISHA: Yeah, we could do that, right?

1256
01:21:59,258 --> 01:22:02,150
MATT: How big is the wall you can make?

1257
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:07,408
LAURA: What were you going to say?

1258
01:22:07,408 --> 01:22:11,047
LIAM: Well, there's little islands of structure
left, we could just--

1259
01:22:11,047 --> 01:22:12,313
LAURA: Hop.

1260
01:22:12,313 --> 01:22:15,845
LIAM: Stand bridge, stand bridge, stand bridge.

1261
01:22:15,845 --> 01:22:21,514
MARISHA: I can go 120 feet. I can make about 120
feet wall.

1262
01:22:21,514 --> 01:22:27,513
MATT: You saw about a quarter to a half mile. This
seems to continue.

1263
01:22:27,513 --> 01:22:30,104
LAURA: So, that might not be enough.

1264
01:22:30,104 --> 01:22:31,721
SAM: She'd have to do it 20 times.

1265
01:22:31,721 --> 01:22:34,756
TALIESIN: I think we may just have to walk
gingerly.

1266
01:22:34,756 --> 01:22:37,029
MARISHA: Maybe we can fashion--

1267
01:22:37,029 --> 01:22:39,290
ASHLEY: Should we find traps? Check for traps?

1268
01:22:39,290 --> 01:22:41,727
MARISHA: Can we fashion snow boots?

1269
01:22:41,727 --> 01:22:49,387
LIAM: Vax starts feeling along one side of the
wall. Does the ground look firm and more stable on

1270
01:22:49,387 --> 01:22:53,325
the edges? Or is it all just the same?

1271
01:22:53,325 --> 01:22:57,146
MATT: Do you step out a little bit into the area?

1272
01:22:57,146 --> 01:22:59,586
LIAM: Hand on the wall.

1273
01:22:59,586 --> 01:23:01,174
MATT: Hand on the wall? I mean, it's a wall.

1274
01:23:01,174 --> 01:23:02,235
LIAM: No, but I mean-- yes.

1275
01:23:02,235 --> 01:23:03,924
MATT: But you step out with your hand on the
wall.

1276
01:23:03,924 --> 01:23:07,676
LIAM: I'm not stepping out yet. I'm looking at the
ground. Is it pebbles and rock

1277
01:23:07,676 --> 01:23:09,254
all the way to the sides?

1278
01:23:09,254 --> 01:23:11,040
MATT: All the way up to the wall.

1279
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,315
MARISHA: Okay.

1280
01:23:12,315 --> 01:23:20,954
ORION: Lady Keyleth, if you will, could you
perhaps make a flat, sturdy stone tablet we could

1281
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:22,637
all particularly stand on.

1282
01:23:22,637 --> 01:23:24,268
MARISHA: Sure.

1283
01:23:24,268 --> 01:23:28,929
ORION: Make sure it's under a hundred pounds, if
you could. Or actually, two hundred pounds, a

1284
01:23:28,929 --> 01:23:30,719
little bit more to work with.

1285
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:40,411
MARISHA: I use Stone Shape and I bend down and
make a big circle where I am. Carve out a little

1286
01:23:40,411 --> 01:23:42,523
cylinder with Stone Shape.

1287
01:23:42,523 --> 01:23:48,576
MATT: So, using a very earthbender-y hand motion,
you take a portion of the wall right next to you,

1288
01:23:48,576 --> 01:23:52,384
send it outward and begin to shape it into this
large cylinder--

1289
01:23:52,384 --> 01:23:53,439
MARISHA: Disc.

1290
01:23:53,439 --> 01:23:56,966
MATT: Disc-like platform, that's (boof) on the
ground, right at the base of the platform.

1291
01:23:56,966 --> 01:24:01,208
ORION: Everybody, hop on.

1292
01:24:01,208 --> 01:24:03,347
LAURA: Trinket, hop on this rock.

1293
01:24:03,347 --> 01:24:05,275
ORION: Wait a minute, how much does Trinket
weigh?

1294
01:24:05,275 --> 01:24:06,241
LAURA: A lot.

1295
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:07,284
LIAM: Is it 200?

1296
01:24:07,284 --> 01:24:09,011
MATT: Trinket weighs more than that.

1297
01:24:09,011 --> 01:24:10,967
LIAM: Trinket weighs a ton. All of us together.

1298
01:24:10,967 --> 01:24:12,484
MARISHA: Maybe you could just levitate Trinket
behind?

1299
01:24:12,484 --> 01:24:16,655
ORION: I don't have that spell anymore. I need to
know how much she weighs for this.

1300
01:24:16,655 --> 01:24:21,019
MATT: Trinket, I mean, looking at it, you haven't
really weighed her yourself, you gather--

1301
01:24:21,019 --> 01:24:22,788
LAURA: Trinket's a boy!

1302
01:24:22,788 --> 01:24:24,660
MATT: Trinket weighs approximately--

1303
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:25,432
(all laugh)

1304
01:24:25,432 --> 01:24:30,893
SAM: Trinket's a boy?! With a name like Trinket?

1305
01:24:30,893 --> 01:24:35,528
LIAM: Haven't you seen his wang flopping around
under his tail?

1306
01:24:35,528 --> 01:24:39,127
MATT: Trinket's probably close to a thousand.

1307
01:24:39,127 --> 01:24:46,059
ORION: So here's the situation. I can get us all
across, but I cannot take Trinket as well.

1308
01:24:46,059 --> 01:24:50,961
LAURA: I'm not leaving Trinket behind. So
everybody get on that and we'll see what happens.

1309
01:24:50,961 --> 01:24:52,693
SAM: Why don't we go across. He can come back and
get Trinket.

1310
01:24:52,693 --> 01:24:57,345
LAURA: Okay, yeah. How about you guys go and I'll
stay with Trinket. You guys go.

1311
01:24:57,345 --> 01:24:59,071
LIAM: Well, I'm not going to leave her.

1312
01:24:59,071 --> 01:25:07,004
MARISHA: Can we make him weightless and then tug
him along with the rope? We can't do that?

1313
01:25:07,004 --> 01:25:10,650
ASHLEY: I have a question. How many feet across?

1314
01:25:10,650 --> 01:25:12,389
LAURA: It's like half a mile.

1315
01:25:12,389 --> 01:25:15,014
MATT: Quarter to a half mile from what you can
tell, like I said, you only have vision enough to

1316
01:25:15,014 --> 01:25:19,494
where the arrow arced and it was a very long
arc, that just trailed off so you gather anywhere

1317
01:25:19,494 --> 01:25:21,616
between a quarter to a half mile.

1318
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:23,497
ASHLEY: I want to run across.

1319
01:25:23,497 --> 01:25:25,032
(all laugh)

1320
01:25:25,032 --> 01:25:27,896
SAM: With your heavy armor.

1321
01:25:28,066 --> 01:25:30,522
LIAM: Sneak right in there.

1322
01:25:30,522 --> 01:25:32,380
LAURA: Oh, just do it.

1323
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:35,526
ASHLEY: Wait, are we getting on the rock?

1324
01:25:35,526 --> 01:25:39,940
LIAM: How far is the closest little island of
remaining structure that you referenced?

1325
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:43,247
MATT: Oh it's probably about 60, 70 feet out.

1326
01:25:43,247 --> 01:25:48,620
LAURA: I don't sense any undead with my primal
awareness do I?

1327
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:56,111
MATT: The perpetual presence that you sense across
the entirety of this bed of bone and glass, if you

1328
01:25:56,111 --> 01:26:05,953
had to describe it, it has some sort of undead-ish
realm. It's not your specialty, I mean it is, like

1329
01:26:05,953 --> 01:26:10,564
undead creatures are, and the presence is similar
to that.

1330
01:26:10,564 --> 01:26:12,833
ASHLEY: I get my Mace of Disruption ready.

1331
01:26:12,833 --> 01:26:14,369
LAURA: Oh, and Kima!

1332
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:18,086
MARISHA: (gasps) Oh! We're done! We can do this!
We polymorph Trinket!

1333
01:26:18,086 --> 01:26:19,342
ORION: That's it, yes!

1334
01:26:19,342 --> 01:26:20,614
MARISHA: We polymorph Trinket!

1335
01:26:20,614 --> 01:26:21,926
ORION: Very good.

1336
01:26:21,926 --> 01:26:23,192
ASHLEY: Into a tiny tiny?

1337
01:26:23,192 --> 01:26:24,584
ORION: Make him into a chicken.

1338
01:26:24,584 --> 01:26:33,049
MATT: You instinctively glance around, you look
down, and you notice your holy symbol of Sarenrae

1339
01:26:33,049 --> 01:26:41,540
has a hairline fracture in it. What was once a
perfect and impeccable sphere of design-- you've

1340
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:48,057
had this your entire life, you look down and see,
you don't know how recently, but a portion of the

1341
01:26:48,057 --> 01:26:52,208
metal symbol itself is cracked.

1342
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:54,872
SAM: Oh, Pike.

1343
01:26:54,872 --> 01:26:56,691
ASHLEY: Oh no, this is terrible.

1344
01:26:56,691 --> 01:26:58,420
LAURA: Pike, pray! do something!

1345
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:10,432
ORION: I motion over to Pike and I take her
medallion slowly off of her and go-- and bring out

1346
01:27:10,432 --> 01:27:11,837
my Mending Wheel.

1347
01:27:11,837 --> 01:27:14,728
MATT: Your Mending Wheel, which was where? It was
in the Bag of Holding.

1348
01:27:14,728 --> 01:27:16,104
ORION: No, I held that.

1349
01:27:16,104 --> 01:27:18,685
MATT: The Mending Wheel's this big. You haven't
been carrying it with you this entire time!

1350
01:27:18,685 --> 01:27:20,615
ORION: What? I thought it was like this big.

1351
01:27:20,615 --> 01:27:22,956
MATT: (laughs) Tiberius.

1352
01:27:22,956 --> 01:27:28,311
ASHLEY: I'll take my symbol back, put it back on,
and say, this is something that I've got to--

1353
01:27:28,311 --> 01:27:32,328
this is something I need to deal with. We can't
just put it in a Mending Wheel.

1354
01:27:32,328 --> 01:27:35,064
LIAM: The gods reward deeds, not words.

1355
01:27:35,064 --> 01:27:36,656
ASHLEY: Yes.

1356
01:27:36,656 --> 01:27:39,034
MARISHA: Maybe it happened in the fight.

1357
01:27:39,034 --> 01:27:42,958
ASHLEY: I think I know why it happened.

1358
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:45,870
SAM: Maybe because you've been killing unarmed
people?

1359
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:50,244
ASHLEY: I think it was when I slit the guy's
throat. She got mad. Just a hunch.

1360
01:27:50,244 --> 01:27:52,104
SAM: But you know what? We'll do some good deeds
when we're done.

1361
01:27:52,104 --> 01:27:56,129
ASHLEY: Yeah. This is something that I need to
fix, but thank you for trying.

1362
01:27:56,129 --> 01:27:58,217
ORION: I forgot we didn't have it.

1363
01:27:58,217 --> 01:28:03,308
LAURA: Well, Trinket, what do you want to be? A
lizard? A mouse?

1364
01:28:03,308 --> 01:28:05,159
MATT: (bear noises)

1365
01:28:05,159 --> 01:28:08,345
LAURA: A kitten? (gasps) A kitten.

1366
01:28:08,345 --> 01:28:09,486
ASHLEY: A little kitty.

1367
01:28:09,486 --> 01:28:10,722
LAURA: You want to be a kitten?

1368
01:28:10,722 --> 01:28:16,571
MATT: (laughs) Trinket glances over at you with a
look in the eye of like--

1369
01:28:16,571 --> 01:28:19,657
MARISHA: And I go (floop), and I make him a
kitten. What kind of kitten?

1370
01:28:19,657 --> 01:28:21,033
LAURA: Oh, he's a Persian.

1371
01:28:21,033 --> 01:28:22,512
MARISHA: He's a Persian kitten.

1372
01:28:22,512 --> 01:28:27,627
MATT: Trinket's form (shwoop) shifts down into
this tiny white puffball with a pushed-in nose.

1373
01:28:27,627 --> 01:28:29,685
LAURA: You're the cutest, Trinket.

1374
01:28:29,685 --> 01:28:31,294
ASHLEY: I go and I snuggle, and I nuzzle him.

1375
01:28:31,294 --> 01:28:33,045
LAURA: I tuck him into my shirt.

1376
01:28:33,045 --> 01:28:40,002
MATT: You sense immediately, Trinket is not
necessarily pleased, but will deal with it.

1377
01:28:40,002 --> 01:28:41,260
MARISHA: Well, he's so cute.

1378
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:42,574
LAURA: He's so cute.

1379
01:28:42,574 --> 01:28:44,952
ORION: In Draconia, those are snacks.

1380
01:28:44,952 --> 01:28:47,762
SAM: I wouldn't say that.

1381
01:28:47,762 --> 01:28:50,235
LAURA: Let's go! Come on! Let's get on this thing!
Grog's getting ahead of us.

1382
01:28:50,235 --> 01:28:53,212
SAM: All right, let's go. On our stone airplane.

1383
01:28:53,383 --> 01:28:56,686
MARISHA: Let's get on the Wonkavator, everybody.

1384
01:28:56,686 --> 01:29:00,195
ASHLEY: All right hop on. I hop on.

1385
01:29:00,195 --> 01:29:03,108
MATT: All right, so you all hop onto this giant
stone. It's really cramped, you're all

1386
01:29:03,108 --> 01:29:06,999
shoulder-to-shoulder pushed onto here, clutched
onto your new Persian cat. Kima and Clarota step

1387
01:29:06,999 --> 01:29:09,832
onto it.

1388
01:29:09,832 --> 01:29:14,337
ORION: I cast Telekinesis on the stone slab, lift
us up, and push us.

1389
01:29:14,337 --> 01:29:17,142
MATT: Okay, how much weight can you push through
Telekinesis?

1390
01:29:17,142 --> 01:29:18,307
ORION: A thousand.

1391
01:29:18,307 --> 01:29:19,798
MATT: Okay.

1392
01:29:19,798 --> 01:29:32,232
ORION: I did all the math. (clears throat) Vax
weighs 155, Pike weighs 75. Taliesin weighs 190,

1393
01:29:32,232 --> 01:29:34,279
Vex weighs 120.

1394
01:29:34,279 --> 01:29:35,946
ASHLEY: But Scanlan weighs nothing.

1395
01:29:35,946 --> 01:29:39,776
ORION: Sam weighs the same, 75. Keyleth weighs
125.

1396
01:29:39,776 --> 01:29:46,920
MATT: Yep. Kima weighs 105. With all of her armor,
she'd be 105.

1397
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:48,294
SAM: Clarota can float.

1398
01:29:48,294 --> 01:29:51,506
MATT: Clarota can float. Does that still fall
under a thousand total?

1399
01:29:51,506 --> 01:29:53,092
ORION: Yeah, should. Is that right?

1400
01:29:53,092 --> 01:29:53,980
SAM: What about you?

1401
01:29:53,980 --> 01:29:55,545
TALIESIN: Plus the rock.

1402
01:29:55,545 --> 01:29:56,807
LAURA: The rock would be less.

1403
01:29:56,807 --> 01:29:58,190
ORION: That's why I kept a hundred pounds for
that.

1404
01:29:58,190 --> 01:29:59,869
MARISHA: A hundred pounds for the rock.

1405
01:29:59,869 --> 01:30:01,819
LIAM: Want to run those numbers again for the
calculator?

1406
01:30:01,819 --> 01:30:04,933
MATT: Rock's 100 pounds? That's not a lot of
stone.

1407
01:30:04,933 --> 01:30:07,107
LAURA: It's a very thin piece of stone.

1408
01:30:07,107 --> 01:30:09,015
MATT: That's a very thin piece of stone. All
right.

1409
01:30:09,015 --> 01:30:11,478
ORION: Nine. Nope, we're at nine-- we're there.
We're at nine-something. You can do all the math,

1410
01:30:11,478 --> 01:30:12,872
but it's nine-something.

1411
01:30:12,872 --> 01:30:16,070
MATT: Okay, all right, so you all stand on the
platform. It (straining noises) rises up, and it's

1412
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:20,885
one of those all of you have to gather yourself,
but nevertheless it is now floating. How long does

1413
01:30:20,885 --> 01:30:22,420
it last, concentration wise?

1414
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:23,313
ORION: Ten minutes.

1415
01:30:23,313 --> 01:30:24,195
MATT: All right.

1416
01:30:24,195 --> 01:30:25,791
LAURA: Quick! Float us!

1417
01:30:25,791 --> 01:30:29,516
MATT: So, as Tiberius begins to concentrate, the
stone begins to glide out over this expanse of

1418
01:30:29,516 --> 01:30:32,522
broken bone and obsidian glass.

1419
01:30:32,522 --> 01:30:39,051
ORION: I hover about-- what's bone break?-- around
six feet above the air.

1420
01:30:39,051 --> 01:30:40,318
That's how high I take it.

1421
01:30:40,318 --> 01:30:42,738
MATT: Okay, so you're cresting about six feet. You
have to move it around occasionally to avoid some

1422
01:30:42,786 --> 01:30:45,475
of the large stalagmites that are jutting out of
the bones.

1423
01:30:45,475 --> 01:30:50,698
LAURA: Do we see anything? I'm keeping an eye out,
see if I see any movement or anything that's maybe

1424
01:30:50,698 --> 01:30:52,134
sparkles. I don't know.

1425
01:30:52,134 --> 01:30:53,426
TALIESIN: Keeping an eye behind us, as well.

1426
01:30:53,426 --> 01:31:00,484
MATT: Okay. You guys, keeping an eye out, you see
more and more of this ruin, and you can see the

1427
01:31:00,484 --> 01:31:05,814
the further in you go, you start seeing bits of
bone that are larger than what's near the edge.

1428
01:31:05,814 --> 01:31:12,276
You start seeing bits and pieces that are full
bones, so they've been more-- still rounded and

1429
01:31:12,276 --> 01:31:15,485
weathered, but they're less ground down as
supposed to the edges where most of the traction

1430
01:31:15,485 --> 01:31:31,483
seems to be. You get about 300 feet out before you
hear a loud, echoing scream across the cavern.

1431
01:31:31,664 --> 01:31:34,556
(loud yell)

1432
01:31:34,556 --> 01:31:35,769
ORION: In front of us?

1433
01:31:35,769 --> 01:31:36,819
MATT: In front of you guys.

1434
01:31:36,819 --> 01:31:37,717
LAURA: What's it sound like?

1435
01:31:37,717 --> 01:31:39,374
MATT: It's male, and it's loud.

1436
01:31:39,374 --> 01:31:40,646
LAURA: Go! Can we go faster?

1437
01:31:40,646 --> 01:31:46,724
ORION: We hear this. I push us forward. I mean,
we're going in that direction anyways, so I speed

1438
01:31:46,724 --> 01:31:47,900
us up.

1439
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:49,765
LIAM: Keyleth, take the gnomes!

1440
01:31:49,765 --> 01:31:52,011
MATT: Correct, okay. As you speed up and
continue--

1441
01:31:52,011 --> 01:31:57,230
ASHLEY: I jump on Keyleth.

1442
01:31:57,230 --> 01:31:58,237
LIAM: Take the gnomes!

1443
01:31:58,237 --> 01:31:59,000
MATT: Okay.

1444
01:31:59,000 --> 01:31:59,911
ASHLEY: Grab some feathers.

1445
01:31:59,911 --> 01:32:01,151
SAM: I'll grab on as well. Why not.

1446
01:32:01,151 --> 01:32:04,352
MATT: All right, so Keyleth, you transform
maintaining concentration on Polymorph for

1447
01:32:04,352 --> 01:32:10,174
Trinket, I believe, right? All right. It's not a
spell, it's an effect you do. So you (whooshing

1448
01:32:10,174 --> 01:32:13,379
noise) you transform into a giant eagle, you grab
both the gnomes, you guys are lifted up off the

1449
01:32:13,379 --> 01:32:15,257
platform as the platform continues to push
forward.

1450
01:32:15,257 --> 01:32:16,929
ORION: Cool, so I get a little bit more control
over it now. (grunts)

1451
01:32:16,929 --> 01:32:21,181
MATT: A little bit more. As you're pushing forward
you feel the stone itself has this weird wobble to

1452
01:32:21,181 --> 01:32:27,375
it, but you still manage to keep concentration,
pushing forward. Eventually, the little bit of

1453
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:33,978
light from your Light spell cascades past one of
these joining parts of a wall, and then beyond

1454
01:32:33,978 --> 01:32:39,099
that you can see what looks like a few other stone
pillars that are sticking up. And you see what

1455
01:32:39,099 --> 01:32:43,610
looks to be a small party of duergar that are in
the middle of battle.

1456
01:32:43,610 --> 01:32:52,328
There is one duergar who is splattered across the
bone floor. You see a troll that is currently in

1457
01:32:52,328 --> 01:32:57,348
the middle of a fistfight with something that's
moving extremely fast. This blur of motion. You

1458
01:32:57,348 --> 01:33:01,708
can barely make out the physical form before the
troll turns and runs in your direction, surprised

1459
01:33:01,708 --> 01:33:06,840
to see the light coming towards you, and in its
expression of extreme confusion and fear, you see

1460
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:10,604
something (whoosh) past, and its head just (soft
falling sound). Rolls off the top of his

1461
01:33:10,604 --> 01:33:11,869
shoulders.

1462
01:33:11,869 --> 01:33:13,377
LAURA: That's not Grog! We're going to toward a
monster!

1463
01:33:13,377 --> 01:33:16,803
MATT: (crashing sound) The troll body hits the
ground. As it does you see bits of bone begin to

1464
01:33:16,803 --> 01:33:20,213
rise up and pull the troll down underneath.

1465
01:33:20,213 --> 01:33:23,067
LAURA: Oh, it's really good we're not standing on
it!

1466
01:33:23,067 --> 01:33:24,313
ORION: Avoid! (whooshing sound)

1467
01:33:24,313 --> 01:33:25,483
LIAM: Daggers out.

1468
01:33:25,483 --> 01:33:26,791
TALIESIN: Guns out.

1469
01:33:26,791 --> 01:33:30,990
MATT: As you guys begin to push forward you can
see two of the duergar are now backing up

1470
01:33:30,990 --> 01:33:35,002
instinctually. One looks down at his feet now that
have been grabbed, and he's being pulled under,

1471
01:33:35,002 --> 01:33:40,284
and he just starts trying to wrestle himself free.
This blur of motion jumps off one of the

1472
01:33:40,284 --> 01:33:45,486
platforms, spins in the air, and lands with a slam
that completely splatters across the rock that

1473
01:33:45,486 --> 01:33:49,949
he's right next to. This duergar, you can see part
of his jaw go flying off to the side and silence

1474
01:33:50,127 --> 01:33:52,335
hits him in the middle of his scream.

1475
01:33:52,335 --> 01:33:57,544
The last duergar there, you can see who's looking
around, sees the stone platform, and goes, "Let me

1476
01:33:57,544 --> 01:34:01,676
"on! Let me on!" He goes running over and is trying
to jump up towards the stone platform

1477
01:34:01,676 --> 01:34:03,516
you guys are on.

1478
01:34:03,516 --> 01:34:04,999
LAURA: How much does he weigh? (giggles)

1479
01:34:04,999 --> 01:34:07,639
MATT: Well, he's going to go ahead and try and
grab it with an athletics check-- he makes it!

1480
01:34:07,639 --> 01:34:09,425
(latching noise) He gets onto the side.

1481
01:34:09,425 --> 01:34:10,579
SAM: Kick him off!

1482
01:34:10,579 --> 01:34:11,881
MARISHA: Fuck that guy!

1483
01:34:11,881 --> 01:34:13,572
LAURA: I punch him in the face!

1484
01:34:13,572 --> 01:34:17,758
MATT: Okay, okay. You go ahead and (punch thud
noise). You just beat him in the face. He holds

1485
01:34:17,758 --> 01:34:20,288
tight. You're not a very strong person,
unfortunately.

1486
01:34:20,288 --> 01:34:22,240
LIAM: I grab him by the cloak. What is it? What
is it?

1487
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:24,932
MATT: "I don't know! Get it away! Get it away!"

1488
01:34:24,932 --> 01:34:29,791
MARISHA: In eagle form, I'm going to do a nice
high soaring lap.

1489
01:34:29,791 --> 01:34:31,053
SAM: We're on you!

1490
01:34:31,053 --> 01:34:37,180
MARISHA: I know! It's okay! I'm going to use my--
I'm soaring high. It's an easy breeze. We're on

1491
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:44,606
the people mover. Okay. And I'm going to use my
keen sight to see if I can get a good... (pew)

1492
01:34:44,606 --> 01:34:48,790
MATT: Okay, so, using that you glance down and in
this brief moment where it seems like the

1493
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:54,114
cacophony of this entire circumstance slows down
(slowing sound noise). And your eagle eyes glance

1494
01:34:54,114 --> 01:35:02,407
down, and you can see in a brief moment the blur
stops. You see a humanoid form. Looking at the

1495
01:35:02,407 --> 01:35:09,717
body and the torso, it looks elven. Its very thin
and gaunt legs dangling as four giant,

1496
01:35:09,717 --> 01:35:14,737
jagged-looking tentacles sprout from both sides of
its torso, holding it aloft.

1497
01:35:14,737 --> 01:35:19,169
Two lifting it off the ground and keeping its body
suspended, while two are (fwhoosh) whipping around

1498
01:35:19,169 --> 01:35:23,848
in the process. As you're glancing, you see its
head (cracking noise) glance up toward the wall.

1499
01:35:23,848 --> 01:35:28,572
These blank, white eyes shooting around in
different directions spontaneously, with this

1500
01:35:28,572 --> 01:35:33,754
maddening look. Whatever this is is clearly insane
and is currently driven on some sort of hunger

1501
01:35:33,754 --> 01:35:38,769
bloodlust. The stitch marks you see across its
body are very reminiscent of the earlier

1502
01:35:38,769 --> 01:35:42,601
abominations that you saw, created by K'varn and
sent throughout this cavern structure.

1503
01:35:42,734 --> 01:35:44,413
LIAM: Keyleth's the only one who sees it, though,
at this moment?

1504
01:35:44,413 --> 01:35:46,245
ORION: Do I see it?

1505
01:35:46,245 --> 01:35:50,862
MATT: You guys haven't yet. At the moment, you're
talking to this dwarf or you're shoving him off

1506
01:35:50,862 --> 01:35:52,585
the platform.

1507
01:35:52,585 --> 01:35:54,663
ORION: Can I see it as I'm cruising through? I see
him?

1508
01:35:54,663 --> 01:35:57,457
LAURA: We wanted to throw him as far as we could.

1509
01:35:57,457 --> 01:35:58,796
LIAM: Yes, the twins pull him up and one--

1510
01:35:58,796 --> 01:36:01,089
LIAM AND LAURA: Two, three!

1511
01:36:01,089 --> 01:36:05,697
MATT: (laughs) All right. As you chuck the duergar
through the air, the creature who briefly had

1512
01:36:05,697 --> 01:36:10,803
stopped, and you guys now see its motion stop, and
you get a full view of its horrible form.

1513
01:36:10,803 --> 01:36:12,595
(grunting, panting sounds)

1514
01:36:12,595 --> 01:36:15,103
ORION: As soon as I do that, I cast True Strike.
(ftsssh)

1515
01:36:15,103 --> 01:36:16,497
MATT: All right, you cast True Strike on
yourself?

1516
01:36:16,497 --> 01:36:17,449
ORION: On him!

1517
01:36:17,449 --> 01:36:18,902
MATT: On him?

1518
01:36:18,902 --> 01:36:23,089
ORION: What it does is, it allows me to see--keep
going, I'll tell you. Go ahead.

1519
01:36:23,089 --> 01:36:28,650
MATT: All right, so it stops for a second. You
guys all get a view of its vision. As it's looking

1520
01:36:28,650 --> 01:36:33,368
up towards where Keyleth is, suddenly its head
(shh) snaps back into focus as the duergar goes

1521
01:36:33,368 --> 01:36:37,650
swinging through the air. As it does (snarling) it
licks its lips and you can see now, where its

1522
01:36:37,650 --> 01:36:43,700
mouth is, the lips curl back and the jaw splits
open slightly with this horrible Predator-like

1523
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:48,592
fanged jaw, and the two tentacles that are
currently up in the air reach out, grab, and

1524
01:36:48,592 --> 01:36:50,063
(tshhh) just split it in two.

1525
01:36:50,063 --> 01:36:53,886
Its torso then divides and sprays it with crimson
as it (tongue flicking noise) licks it out of the

1526
01:36:53,886 --> 01:36:55,537
air. (breathy growling)

1527
01:36:55,537 --> 01:36:57,381
LAURA: (whispering) Go faster. Go faster!

1528
01:36:57,381 --> 01:36:59,505
ORION: I'm still going! We're still going. I'm not
standing and watching.

1529
01:36:59,505 --> 01:37:01,714
SAM: Have we passed it yet?

1530
01:37:01,714 --> 01:37:03,707
MATT: Everyone roll initiative.

1531
01:37:03,707 --> 01:37:05,182
LAURA: Oh my god, we're going to fight? We're
going to fight this thing?

1532
01:37:05,308 --> 01:37:12,314
MARISHA: I was going to say we should try and
avoid him. Poop monster.

1533
01:37:12,314 --> 01:37:13,952
LAURA: Oh, god.

1534
01:37:13,952 --> 01:37:16,501
SAM: No, we're floating above it. We've got
advantage.

1535
01:37:16,501 --> 01:37:17,768
MARISHA: Do we?

1536
01:37:17,768 --> 01:37:19,616
LAURA: We're all stuck on a single piece of rock.

1537
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:21,117
ORION: Yeah, well, that's the thing.

1538
01:37:21,117 --> 01:37:23,550
SAM: We're fine. One of us has guns.

1539
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:25,008
MATT: All right.

1540
01:37:25,008 --> 01:37:27,559
LIAM: And we saw the duergar get pulled under by
skeletal arms?

1541
01:37:27,559 --> 01:37:29,238
SAM: By the bones.

1542
01:37:29,238 --> 01:37:34,818
LIAM: Yeah, the bones pulled down, right? So it's
not just this thing.

1543
01:37:34,818 --> 01:37:38,289
MATT: I'm using this as the figure for the
creature.

1544
01:37:38,289 --> 01:37:41,595
ORION: By the way, Matthew.

1545
01:37:41,595 --> 01:37:42,421
MATT: Yes.

1546
01:37:42,421 --> 01:37:47,703
ORION: True Strike. I extend my hand and point a
finger at a target. My magic grants me a brief

1547
01:37:47,703 --> 01:37:51,506
insight into the target's defenses. On my next
turn, I gain advantage on my first attack roll

1548
01:37:51,506 --> 01:37:53,161
against the creature, using that spell as a
guide.

1549
01:37:53,161 --> 01:37:59,215
MATT: Gotcha. So! For the purposes of this, the
two gnomes are alongside Keyleth's eagle form.

1550
01:37:59,215 --> 01:38:01,085
TALIESIN: Oh, we're going to use the little
thingy?

1551
01:38:01,085 --> 01:38:03,331
MARISHA: Yeah, are we going to use the levitating
thingies?

1552
01:38:03,331 --> 01:38:06,824
MATT: What? Yes, we are. Let me pull them out
right now over here.

1553
01:38:06,824 --> 01:38:08,146
TALIESIN: Levitating thingies!

1554
01:38:08,146 --> 01:38:10,632
MARISHA: Levitating thingies! Makes us look cool.

1555
01:38:10,632 --> 01:38:12,850
TALIESIN: It's been so long.

1556
01:38:12,850 --> 01:38:15,472
LAURA: Ooh, I like it.

1557
01:38:15,472 --> 01:38:22,725
MATT: There's the rest of you. Although, Trinket
is a kitten.

1558
01:38:22,725 --> 01:38:26,375
SAM: Trinket is a cat.

1559
01:38:26,375 --> 01:38:28,508
TALIESIN: Trinket only has the power of
"adorability."

1560
01:38:28,508 --> 01:38:32,094
MATT: This is the stone slab over here that you
guys have created. All right, so. Initiative

1561
01:38:32,094 --> 01:38:41,570
rolls, everyone. Starting at... 25 to 20?

1562
01:38:41,570 --> 01:38:43,683
LAURA: 21.

1563
01:38:43,683 --> 01:38:56,228
MATT: All right. That puts Vex at the top of the
round there. And brings-- there we go. 20 to 15?

1564
01:38:56,228 --> 01:38:57,250
LIAM: 17.

1565
01:38:57,250 --> 01:38:58,230
ORION: 18.

1566
01:38:58,230 --> 01:39:07,132
MATT: 18? 15 to ten?

1567
01:39:07,132 --> 01:39:11,682
SAM: 12.

1568
01:39:17,169 --> 01:39:19,006
MATT: Ten to five?

1569
01:39:19,006 --> 01:39:19,869
MARISHA: Eight.

1570
01:39:19,869 --> 01:39:21,001
TALIESIN: Eight.

1571
01:39:21,001 --> 01:39:21,999
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

1572
01:39:21,999 --> 01:39:22,965
MARISHA: Team Eight.

1573
01:39:22,965 --> 01:39:23,824
TALIESIN: Boom.

1574
01:39:23,824 --> 01:39:24,750
MATT: Pike, what did you get?

1575
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:25,668
ASHLEY: Four.

1576
01:39:25,668 --> 01:39:26,478
LAURA: Yay!

1577
01:39:26,478 --> 01:39:28,184
MATT: Okay, yay, Pike, bringing up the rear!

1578
01:39:28,184 --> 01:39:30,100
MARISHA: Team Single Digits!

1579
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:31,763
ASHLEY: Team Single Digits!

1580
01:39:31,763 --> 01:39:33,766
TALIESIN: We'll get there.

1581
01:39:33,766 --> 01:39:44,223
MATT: Top of the round is the monstrosity. It is a
very quick-- move the camera. Follow me this way.

1582
01:39:44,223 --> 01:39:45,466
There we go.

1583
01:39:45,466 --> 01:39:48,061
(all laugh)

1584
01:39:48,061 --> 01:39:55,541
MATT: It uses its quite grand movement of 50
feet to (shh) lumber over to this side, and it

1585
01:39:55,675 --> 01:40:00,660
gets two attacks with its tentacles, with reach.
Actually three attacks.

1586
01:40:00,702 --> 01:40:02,262
MARISHA: On who?

1587
01:40:02,262 --> 01:40:04,502
MATT: This is going to be at you guys.

1588
01:40:04,502 --> 01:40:06,100
LIAM: I don't need this foot.

1589
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:11,416
MATT: This is going to be one at Kima, one at you
and one at Tiberius as you are the three currently

1590
01:40:11,416 --> 01:40:15,621
within its positioning view. First one is going to
be at you.

1591
01:40:15,621 --> 01:40:17,100
LIAM: Okay.

1592
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:19,100
MATT: Oh, that is going to be a 14 to hit?

1593
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:20,813
LIAM: No.

1594
01:40:20,813 --> 01:40:25,244
MATT: All right, so you (whoosh) dodge out of the
way. The one towards Kima. Oh that's going to be a

1595
01:40:25,244 --> 01:40:29,906
15 to hit, which it strikes her armor, but she
manages to pull out of the way and it gleans off

1596
01:40:29,906 --> 01:40:35,316
the side and you can see a little bit of this acid
scarring across the edge of her leather armor. The

1597
01:40:35,370 --> 01:40:45,191
third strike going out towards Tiberius (swoosh).
That is (laughs) a critical one. It actually whips

1598
01:40:45,191 --> 01:40:49,924
out and strikes the bottom of the stone you guys
are standing on, which rocks it for a second, and

1599
01:40:49,924 --> 01:40:53,628
you all essentially get worried but it seems to
have no effect. That was a really terrible opening

1600
01:40:53,628 --> 01:40:55,118
round for the creature.

1601
01:40:55,118 --> 01:40:59,688
MARISHA: Here's my question. Is this all happening
still over top of the bone pit?

1602
01:40:59,688 --> 01:41:00,753
MATT: Oh yeah.

1603
01:41:00,753 --> 01:41:02,557
MARISHA: Okay.

1604
01:41:02,557 --> 01:41:04,316
MATT: That brings us to Vex.

1605
01:41:04,316 --> 01:41:05,963
LAURA: Hunter's Mark!

1606
01:41:05,963 --> 01:41:07,273
MATT: All right so you mark him

1607
01:41:07,273 --> 01:41:08,625
LAURA: Right on that guy.

1608
01:41:08,625 --> 01:41:12,198
MATT: Do it. He is Hunter's Marked and I'm putting
this on here as a reminder of your mark.

1609
01:41:12,198 --> 01:41:13,611
LAURA: Okay.

1610
01:41:13,611 --> 01:41:14,825
TALIESIN: It's so fashionable.

1611
01:41:14,825 --> 01:41:16,202
MATT: Isn't it though.

1612
01:41:16,202 --> 01:41:25,896
LAURA: I'm going to lightning arrow him. Oh, I
can't do that because I Hunter's Marked him.

1613
01:41:25,896 --> 01:41:27,580
MATT: Correct. that was your bonus action.

1614
01:41:27,580 --> 01:41:31,119
LAURA: I'm going to Hail of Thorns that guy.

1615
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:33,671
MATT: All righty, thorn hail him.

1616
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:34,878
LAURA: Okay, at level three.

1617
01:41:34,878 --> 01:41:35,818
MATT: Okay!

1618
01:41:35,818 --> 01:41:39,483
LAURA: Through my Bow of Blazing Bowstring.

1619
01:41:39,483 --> 01:41:43,274
MATT: Okay, so as you pull back your arrow, you
pull it up, you can see the thorns (thoosh)

1620
01:41:43,274 --> 01:41:48,835
actually grow rather rapidly out of the wood
itself and as you pull back, the bowstring itself

1621
01:41:48,835 --> 01:41:54,971
ignites setting the bow, the shaft of the arrow on
fire as well as you release, rolling?

1622
01:41:54,971 --> 01:41:55,905
LAURA: 22.

1623
01:41:55,905 --> 01:41:56,834
MATT: 22 to hit?

1624
01:41:56,834 --> 01:41:57,541
LAURA: Yes.

1625
01:41:57,541 --> 01:41:58,421
MATT: That hits.

1626
01:41:58,421 --> 01:41:59,274
LAURA: Yes!

1627
01:41:59,274 --> 01:41:59,884
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1628
01:41:59,884 --> 01:42:01,867
LAURA: So then I roll my regular damage plus
3d10?

1629
01:42:01,867 --> 01:42:04,016
MATT: Correct, plus the fire damage which is
1d10.

1630
01:42:04,016 --> 01:42:06,709
LAURA: Okay, whoa. So 14 for the first.

1631
01:42:06,709 --> 01:42:10,062
MATT: Okay and then roll technically 4d10 because
it's the fire.

1632
01:42:10,062 --> 01:42:11,788
LAURA: 4d10, this is crazy.

1633
01:42:11,788 --> 01:42:14,479
MATT: Yeah!

1634
01:42:14,479 --> 01:42:19,005
LAURA: Four, 11, 19. 21.

1635
01:42:19,005 --> 01:42:20,865
MATT: So 21 plus 14?

1636
01:42:20,865 --> 01:42:21,751
LAURA: Yes.

1637
01:42:21,751 --> 01:42:26,294
MATT: 35 points of damage. Nice. So you release
(soosh).

1638
01:42:26,294 --> 01:42:27,687
LAURA: Oh plus Hunter's Mark damage!

1639
01:42:27,687 --> 01:42:29,657
MATT: Yep, there you go. That's why you did it.

1640
01:42:29,657 --> 01:42:30,658
LAURA: Six.

1641
01:42:30,658 --> 01:42:33,325
MATT: Nice, 41 points of damage in the first
attack from the ranger.

1642
01:42:33,325 --> 01:42:34,606
MARISHA: (cheers)

1643
01:42:34,606 --> 01:42:39,753
MATT: All righty, so you release the arrow as the
creature (woosh) shifts into place, it lashes out

1644
01:42:39,753 --> 01:42:44,541
with all its tentacles and as it pulls back, looks
like it's ready to pounce you release the arrow

1645
01:42:44,541 --> 01:42:48,305
right towards its torso, it hits, and it looks
down instinctually and it bursts into a spray of

1646
01:42:48,305 --> 01:42:52,915
thorns all over its face and its torso and you can
see it (monster screech) reels back from the pain,

1647
01:42:52,915 --> 01:42:57,559
you can see the flames licking up over the front
of its body. You can see there's a semblance of

1648
01:42:57,559 --> 01:43:02,866
clothing on it. Whatever this thing once was, it's
still wearing the clothing it had and a portion of

1649
01:43:02,866 --> 01:43:07,223
it has burned off part of the torso. Whoever this
poor soul once was, there is no shred of humanity

1650
01:43:07,223 --> 01:43:08,823
left in it.

1651
01:43:08,823 --> 01:43:11,567
ORION: Before that ends I go, hop off.

1652
01:43:11,567 --> 01:43:17,438
LAURA: Hop off? No way. I'm not stepping on this
bone shit.

1653
01:43:17,438 --> 01:43:19,282
LIAM: There's undead things in there

1654
01:43:19,282 --> 01:43:20,344
LAURA: That's my turn.

1655
01:43:20,344 --> 01:43:21,861
MATT: And that's your turn, and you're holding a
kitten.

1656
01:43:21,861 --> 01:43:23,216
LAURA: Oh he's tucked into my armor.

1657
01:43:23,216 --> 01:43:25,488
MATT: Oh, he's tucked into you? Okay. That brings
us to Tiberius, you're up.

1658
01:43:25,488 --> 01:43:27,175
Tiberius, what are you doing.

1659
01:43:27,175 --> 01:43:28,440
LIAM: Tibber-hoods.

1660
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:29,879
MATT: What you got?

1661
01:43:29,879 --> 01:43:32,650
ORION: Okay, everyone hold on tight.

1662
01:43:32,650 --> 01:43:35,624
SAM: You're giving us opposite notes.

1663
01:43:35,624 --> 01:43:41,406
MATT: What you got?

1664
01:43:41,406 --> 01:43:48,162
ORION: How wide was the stone tablet? Ten feet for
all of us to fit on?

1665
01:43:48,162 --> 01:43:52,186
MATT: It's about 15 feet round.

1666
01:43:52,186 --> 01:44:07,567
ORION: Perfect, I move us right above the butthole
and, everybody hold on. And I fucking slam all

1667
01:44:07,567 --> 01:44:10,193
of us right on him. (boosh)

1668
01:44:10,193 --> 01:44:21,307
MATT: Okay. So the platform comes cascading down
at a fair speed immediately breaking over this

1669
01:44:21,307 --> 01:44:30,052
creature, as it is a pretty thin wall to have only
been about 100 pounds. It completely shatters over

1670
01:44:30,052 --> 01:44:34,666
the top of it. Everyone who was on that platform,
go ahead and make a dexterity check.

1671
01:44:34,666 --> 01:44:40,235
ASHLEY: Get it, guys. Come on.

1672
01:44:43,711 --> 01:44:45,471
LAURA: I get two because it's favored terrain,
right?

1673
01:44:45,471 --> 01:44:46,476
MATT: Correct.

1674
01:44:46,476 --> 01:44:49,085
LAURA: Yes, okay good.

1675
01:44:49,085 --> 01:44:51,562
MATT: All right so.

1676
01:44:51,562 --> 01:44:52,779
LIAM: 17.

1677
01:44:52,779 --> 01:44:54,315
LAURA: 23.

1678
01:44:54,315 --> 01:44:56,094
MATT: Oh, Pike's not there.

1679
01:44:56,187 --> 01:44:57,502
TALIESIN: 24.

1680
01:44:57,502 --> 01:44:59,572
ASHLEY: I'm not happening for a while.

1681
01:44:59,572 --> 01:45:00,556
ORION: Me too?

1682
01:45:00,556 --> 01:45:01,451
MATT: Yes.

1683
01:45:01,451 --> 01:45:02,321
ORION: 12.

1684
01:45:02,321 --> 01:45:06,679
MATT: 12. All right. So all the rest of you manage
to leap off and tumble the best you can to catch

1685
01:45:06,679 --> 01:45:09,347
yourself-- except for Tiberius.

1686
01:45:09,347 --> 01:45:13,118
ORION: Wait, do I make a dexterity check? I mean
I'm not-- okay.

1687
01:45:13,118 --> 01:45:17,767
MATT: You do. You're still on the platform. It
just shattered around you. So you however fall

1688
01:45:17,767 --> 01:45:25,530
prone on the ground from the impact and land on
the ground. That's also going to end your turn.

1689
01:45:25,717 --> 01:45:27,483
MARISHA: Did it do any damage?

1690
01:45:27,483 --> 01:45:30,054
ORION: Can I not do any bonus actions?

1691
01:45:30,054 --> 01:45:32,966
MATT: Unfortunately not, due to the failed
dexterity save. It practically knocked the wind

1692
01:45:32,966 --> 01:45:34,507
out of you due to the impact.

1693
01:45:34,507 --> 01:45:35,771
ORION: Okay.

1694
01:45:35,771 --> 01:45:37,801
MATT: That was the unfortunate part of missing
that dexterity check.

1695
01:45:37,801 --> 01:45:39,346
ORION: Okay.

1696
01:45:39,346 --> 01:45:45,233
MATT: However, it does deal from the crushing
damage to the entity that'll be I'll say 3d10

1697
01:45:45,233 --> 01:45:50,758
points of damage. I'll see if it makes its save to
reduce to half. Which it does. Rolled a 21. What's

1698
01:45:50,758 --> 01:45:52,651
your DC in your spell?

1699
01:45:52,651 --> 01:45:53,790
ORION: 17.

1700
01:45:53,790 --> 01:45:56,458
MATT: So it makes its save, so it's half damage.
Roll 3d10 and it's half that.

1701
01:45:56,458 --> 01:46:06,870
ORION: (counting noises) What is that, 19.

1702
01:46:06,926 --> 01:46:10,841
MATT: Okay, so it takes a total of nine points of
damage. Crushing damage from the blow of the stone

1703
01:46:10,841 --> 01:46:15,548
on top of it. Nice. As it (crssh) shrugs off bits
of chunks of stone that are around its body, you

1704
01:46:15,548 --> 01:46:20,040
can see a little bit of blood is being pulled to
the seams of its body. It's taken some hits. It's

1705
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:25,109
still doing all right but it's definitely-- you
can see it's not impervious by any means. That

1706
01:46:25,109 --> 01:46:26,995
brings us to Vax.

1707
01:46:27,046 --> 01:46:30,672
LIAM: All right, well, I use my bonus action to
click my Boots of Haste together.

1708
01:46:30,672 --> 01:46:33,044
MATT: Your Boot of Haste.

1709
01:46:33,044 --> 01:46:35,419
LIAM: Boot of Haste? But aren't magic items
resistant to--

1710
01:46:35,419 --> 01:46:37,003
MATT: Oh yeah I was messing around.

1711
01:46:37,003 --> 01:46:51,384
LIAM: Okay, yeah. Start sneak attack from behind.
32 for the first attack.

1712
01:46:51,479 --> 01:46:57,139
MATT: You unfortunately do not get sneak attack on
this. It knows where you are. You do not get the

1713
01:46:57,139 --> 01:47:00,047
round before it-- nobody else is adjacent to it
because everyone else had to

1714
01:47:00,047 --> 01:47:01,322
jump off the platform.

1715
01:47:01,322 --> 01:47:03,012
LIAM: So no one's right next to it? I'm the
closest one?

1716
01:47:03,012 --> 01:47:05,977
MATT: Currently no. You are the closest one to it
because everyone had to jump off as it fell, and

1717
01:47:05,977 --> 01:47:09,609
the fact that as soon as you rush towards it, its
head (cracking noise) clicked over its back and

1718
01:47:09,609 --> 01:47:12,320
looked straight at you, almost the neck bending in
the process.

1719
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:15,147
LIAM: You block me every chance you get with this
one. So that was the first attack...

1720
01:47:15,147 --> 01:47:20,806
MATT: No, this creature is really quick and very 
aware of its surroundings.

1721
01:47:20,981 --> 01:47:34,299
LIAM: So first attack is nine. There's more coming.
Here comes the poison dagger, which is 23.

1722
01:47:34,341 --> 01:47:36,750
MATT: 23. That does hit.

1723
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:42,397
LIAM: That is ten. Because of the Boots of Haste,
I get a third attack.

1724
01:47:42,569 --> 01:47:43,518
MATT: You do.

1725
01:47:43,518 --> 01:47:46,078
LIAM: And that misses entirely. In fact, I think I
threw my dagger into the bones.

1726
01:47:46,078 --> 01:47:47,178
MATT: What did you roll a one?

1727
01:47:47,178 --> 01:47:48,549
LIAM: A one, yeah.

1728
01:47:48,549 --> 01:47:54,380
MATT: Okay, so the first strike hits. The second
one, you feel the poison energy pulse through the

1729
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:56,288
blade. What's the DC on that again?

1730
01:47:56,481 --> 01:48:00,048
LIAM: It's 15.

1731
01:48:00,048 --> 01:48:08,437
MATT: That hits. You feel the poison (crssh) enter
its side, and it looks down-- oh, it is immune to

1732
01:48:08,437 --> 01:48:18,004
poison. Sorry. Oh, abyssal abominations! So the
second blade goes in. The third one, you go ahead

1733
01:48:18,004 --> 01:48:22,939
and swing towards it, and it (splssh) actually
slaps the blade out of your hand and sticks to the

1734
01:48:22,939 --> 01:48:27,959
ceiling. (whoosh) Thankfully, it returns back to
your belt because magical belts are cool.

1735
01:48:27,959 --> 01:48:34,624
All right, cool. That ends your turn. Kima's turn.
Kima, who just managed to land, grabs her sword

1736
01:48:34,624 --> 01:48:39,011
and reaches over. You can see the divine energy
instilled within her blade. She is going to make

1737
01:48:39,011 --> 01:48:46,686
two attacks against the creature. She rushes
towards it on that side there. It's going to be

1738
01:48:46,686 --> 01:48:57,698
yeah, 17. That'll hit. That's 27 to hit, and then
a natural 20. So a hit and a critical. She's

1739
01:48:57,698 --> 01:49:04,264
going to go ahead and get 15 damage from the first
strike. Second one is going to be...

1740
01:49:04,264 --> 01:49:06,839
MARISHA: We need to get off this floor real bad.

1741
01:49:06,839 --> 01:49:08,134
SAM: Well you're not on it.

1742
01:49:08,134 --> 01:49:09,420
MARISHA: I'm not.

1743
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:11,166
SAM: You can make a dance floor next to them.

1744
01:49:11,166 --> 01:49:14,678
MATT: All right, as she strikes it both times with
the sword, you can see the first strike hits and

1745
01:49:14,678 --> 01:49:18,867
the second one, she swings around and she instills
with her Divine Smite, which does an additional

1746
01:49:18,867 --> 01:49:27,172
eight points of divine damage. The second strike,
as it slashes across, you can see the torso splits

1747
01:49:27,172 --> 01:49:33,517
open. As the torso opens up, you can see a part of
its guts spill out, and they begin to slowly pull

1748
01:49:33,517 --> 01:49:35,150
themselves back in.

1749
01:49:35,150 --> 01:49:37,001
MARISHA: Hell no.

1750
01:49:37,001 --> 01:49:38,449
SAM: She's Wolverine!

1751
01:49:38,449 --> 01:49:40,830
MATT: (laughs) Scanlan you're up.

1752
01:49:40,830 --> 01:49:48,340
SAM: Okay. Do I have a clean line of sight on her?
Or are we too far away?

1753
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:52,667
MATT: You guys are up in the air being held by
her. Probably actually I'd say...

1754
01:49:52,667 --> 01:49:56,101
MARISHA: I'm doing the eagle glide.

1755
01:49:56,101 --> 01:49:58,216
MATT: You guys are about 30 feet up right now.

1756
01:49:58,216 --> 01:49:59,886
LAURA: Oh man.

1757
01:49:59,886 --> 01:50:05,478
SAM: All right, so I think I'm in range. I'm just
going to blind the bitch.

1758
01:50:05,478 --> 01:50:07,683
So I cast Blindness on her.

1759
01:50:07,683 --> 01:50:09,251
MATT: Okay, what's the range on that?

1760
01:50:09,251 --> 01:50:10,145
LAURA: It's a girl?

1761
01:50:10,145 --> 01:50:11,142
ASHLEY: It's a her?

1762
01:50:11,142 --> 01:50:12,116
SAM: Isn't it a girl?

1763
01:50:12,116 --> 01:50:13,332
MATT: No it's a male elf.

1764
01:50:13,332 --> 01:50:16,471
SAM: Yeah, well I'm so demeaning to it, I call it
a girl.

1765
01:50:16,471 --> 01:50:18,167
ASHLEY AND LAURA: Why is that demeaning?

1766
01:50:18,167 --> 01:50:23,278
SAM: Because it is a chauvinist. I know that.

1767
01:50:23,278 --> 01:50:29,555
MATT: What's the range on that, Scanlan?

1768
01:50:29,555 --> 01:50:30,786
SAM: I'm looking.

1769
01:50:30,786 --> 01:50:33,610
ASHLEY: Disadvantage on his roll!

1770
01:50:33,610 --> 01:50:35,391
LIAM: You're in the wrong group to being saying
that shit, man.

1771
01:50:35,391 --> 01:50:36,608
(all laugh)

1772
01:50:36,608 --> 01:50:38,174
SAM: I'm drunk!

1773
01:50:38,174 --> 01:50:41,539
MARISHA: Whatever. (laughs)

1774
01:50:41,539 --> 01:50:44,171
SAM: How far am I? I can't even tell. I can't see
the board.

1775
01:50:44,171 --> 01:50:48,401
MATT: You're about 70 feet.

1776
01:50:48,401 --> 01:50:49,960
SAM: I can't do it.

1777
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:52,891
MATT: You can hold your turn if you want to wait
for Keyleth to go.

1778
01:50:52,891 --> 01:50:59,150
SAM: I can hold my turn? I've never done this
before.

1779
01:50:59,150 --> 01:51:02,152
MATT: Yeah. Meaning if you're waiting for someone
else to take their turn first, you can hold back

1780
01:51:02,152 --> 01:51:04,232
until they do theirs. So you can wait for her to
pull you closer.

1781
01:51:04,232 --> 01:51:08,786
SAM: Okay. I will wait for that, then, and I love
women.

1782
01:51:08,786 --> 01:51:11,470
ASHLEY: Oh, we know. We know.

1783
01:51:11,470 --> 01:51:12,490
SAM: Biblically.

1784
01:51:12,490 --> 01:51:15,797
MARISHA: Keyleth does a little dip really quick.

1785
01:51:15,797 --> 01:51:17,060
MATT: All right, gotcha.

1786
01:51:17,060 --> 01:51:19,770
MARISHA: Makes Scanlan a little nervous.

1787
01:51:19,770 --> 01:51:32,094
MATT: All right. Clarota takes his turn. Clarota
is going to... the situation's too dangerous to do

1788
01:51:32,094 --> 01:51:38,206
anything Lightning Bolt related. Clarota instead
is going to use Mind Blast against the creature.

1789
01:51:38,265 --> 01:51:43,313
No that's no good either, at this positioning--
yeah no, because he'll

1790
01:51:43,313 --> 01:51:44,702
get a bunch of you guys, too.

1791
01:51:44,702 --> 01:51:45,616
SAM: God, Clarota.

1792
01:51:45,616 --> 01:51:46,873
MARISHA: Clarota!

1793
01:51:46,873 --> 01:51:49,574
MATT: Instead Clarota is going to...

1794
01:51:49,574 --> 01:51:50,797
LAURA: Can he heal us?

1795
01:51:50,797 --> 01:51:56,348
MATT: No. Clarota's not really the healing kind.
Clarota is going to cast Blur on himself to try

1796
01:51:56,487 --> 01:52:01,925
and keep it from taking one of these points of
wound damage. So he uses his turn to cast Blur.

1797
01:52:02,238 --> 01:52:07,275
Clarota's form begins to shift and vibrate in and
out of place where it's hard to see exactly where

1798
01:52:07,275 --> 01:52:13,201
Clarota is standing. Clarota is going to take two
steps back, unfortunately in the threat range of

1799
01:52:13,201 --> 01:52:18,823
the creature. It gets (whoosh) a reaction to
attack against Clarota. Thanks to the Blur spell,

1800
01:52:18,823 --> 01:52:26,384
though, it misses entirely. So the strike strikes
and it passes through with no effect. Clarota

1801
01:52:26,436 --> 01:52:31,607
moves behind one of the rocks here, actually this
far, for cover. That ends Clarota's turn. Keyleth

1802
01:52:31,607 --> 01:52:32,902
you're up.

1803
01:52:32,902 --> 01:52:36,723
MARISHA: Okay. I caw-caw closer

1804
01:52:36,723 --> 01:52:40,944
MATT: Like over where?

1805
01:52:40,944 --> 01:52:55,521
MARISHA: Yeah, there's good. Shit, can't cast any
spells unless I land. I'm going to have to drop

1806
01:52:55,655 --> 01:53:02,946
down. Can I perch on one of these stalactites?

1807
01:53:02,946 --> 01:53:05,609
MATT: You can, but you're going to have to let go
of the gnomes to do so.

1808
01:53:05,609 --> 01:53:06,939
ASHLEY: Do it.

1809
01:53:06,939 --> 01:53:07,955
MARISHA: Can I drop off you guys?

1810
01:53:07,955 --> 01:53:09,277
ASHLEY: Yep.

1811
01:53:09,277 --> 01:53:11,237
MATT: You hear (bird noises).

1812
01:53:11,237 --> 01:53:12,484
SAM: What?

1813
01:53:12,484 --> 01:53:15,172
MARISHA: And I drop them off really quick.

1814
01:53:15,172 --> 01:53:16,588
ASHLEY: What did she say?

1815
01:53:16,588 --> 01:53:21,183
MATT: All right, so both of you guys make
acrobatics checks. Disadvantage for you because of

1816
01:53:21,183 --> 01:53:23,011
your armor.

1817
01:53:23,011 --> 01:53:24,688
ASHLEY: But don't I get a plus ten?

1818
01:53:24,688 --> 01:53:26,155
MATT: Not for acrobatics, you don't.

1819
01:53:26,155 --> 01:53:27,821
LIAM: Right. You're a bullet falling from the
sky.

1820
01:53:27,924 --> 01:53:29,093
SAM: 16.

1821
01:53:29,204 --> 01:53:35,514
MATT: Okay.

1822
01:53:35,556 --> 01:53:36,746
ASHLEY: Eight.

1823
01:53:36,805 --> 01:53:43,106
MATT: All right. As both of you guys get released
as you go to perch on these rocks.

1824
01:53:43,106 --> 01:53:51,115
MARISHA: I'm going to turn back into Keyleth holding
onto the rock.

1825
01:53:51,295 --> 01:53:56,365
MATT: Okay. So we'll put you there. Keyleth, no
longer an eagle. This is out of the way. You guys

1826
01:53:56,365 --> 01:53:59,198
both land here and here.

1827
01:53:59,198 --> 01:54:01,114
MARISHA: But I'm still on the rock. I still want
to be on the rock.

1828
01:54:01,114 --> 01:54:04,136
MATT: I'm considering you on the rock, but I don't
want to have to try and balance you right there.

1829
01:54:04,136 --> 01:54:11,032
Scanlan, you land, catch yourself on the bones, and
you're fine. Pike, you sink into your waist at the

1830
01:54:11,177 --> 01:54:13,656
impact.

1831
01:54:13,656 --> 01:54:16,062
ASHLEY: Because my armor's so heavy? (laughs)

1832
01:54:16,211 --> 01:54:19,068
MATT: Speed and the way your inability to catch
your weight and use it. You just go (schoomp).

1833
01:54:19,068 --> 01:54:21,307
Just stick directly into the bone up to your
waist.

1834
01:54:21,307 --> 01:54:22,792
LIAM: You're gnomic lawn art.

1835
01:54:22,792 --> 01:54:23,969
ASHLEY: Aw, dang it!

1836
01:54:23,969 --> 01:54:25,097
MATT: Percy you're up!

1837
01:54:25,097 --> 01:54:26,188
MARISHA: Wait, I'm not done!

1838
01:54:26,188 --> 01:54:27,748
MATT: Right. Sorry, you turn back. So Keyleth,
what are you doing?

1839
01:54:27,748 --> 01:54:34,981
MARISHA: The laser pointer's dead. Now I'm going
to make a wall of stone. Wait, is there someone in

1840
01:54:34,981 --> 01:54:37,718
the way? Is there somebody behind him? Is that
Vax?

1841
01:54:37,718 --> 01:54:38,806
LIAM AND MATT: Yeah.

1842
01:54:38,806 --> 01:54:41,208
MARISHA: Damn it, Vax!

1843
01:54:41,208 --> 01:54:43,498
SAM: He didn't ask to be dropped there.

1844
01:54:43,498 --> 01:54:46,095
LAURA: That's where we landed.

1845
01:54:46,095 --> 01:54:53,714
MARISHA: Shitballs. All right. I'm going to do
Grasping Vine, then. No, I should make us a dance

1846
01:54:53,714 --> 01:55:04,961
floor. I'm going to make us a dance floor, then.
I'm going to do a wall of stone. How concentrated

1847
01:55:04,961 --> 01:55:10,721
can I do my wall of stone, actually? Can I do a
wall of stone to where it's doughnut-shaped? Where

1848
01:55:10,721 --> 01:55:15,243
there's a hole in the middle? And now I make a
wall going across the top?

1849
01:55:15,243 --> 01:55:17,223
TALIESIN: A doughnut of stone.

1850
01:55:17,223 --> 01:55:21,450
MATT: I would say, based on the description of it
here...

1851
01:55:21,450 --> 01:55:26,030
MARISHA: A horizontal wall?

1852
01:55:26,030 --> 01:55:28,010
MATT: Ten foot by ten foot panels.

1853
01:55:28,010 --> 01:55:30,948
SAM: Panels. Squares.

1854
01:55:30,948 --> 01:55:36,137
MATT: Alternatively, you can create ten foot by 20
foot panels that are only three inches thick. So

1855
01:55:36,137 --> 01:55:40,060
yes, you can, you can create any shape you desire,
so you can make it a doughnut hole type thing if

1856
01:55:40,060 --> 01:55:41,309
you want to.

1857
01:55:41,309 --> 01:55:45,575
MARISHA: Dope. So, I'm going to make a
doughnut-shaped dance floor, and I'm going to make

1858
01:55:45,575 --> 01:55:50,627
a hole in the middle to where he's still in the
middle in the bone, but we're all on rock. Around

1859
01:55:50,627 --> 01:55:52,219
this area.

1860
01:55:52,219 --> 01:55:54,027
MATT: So, it's just around all of you guys or
underneath everybody?

1861
01:55:54,027 --> 01:55:55,583
MARISHA: Underneath us.

1862
01:55:55,583 --> 01:55:56,380
MATT: Okay.

1863
01:55:56,380 --> 01:55:57,904
MARISHA: I'm making a dance floor.

1864
01:55:57,904 --> 01:56:02,810
SAM: That was an excellent move by a strong,
independent woman who doesn't need a man to tell

1865
01:56:02,810 --> 01:56:07,699
her what to do. Or to validate her in any way.

1866
01:56:07,699 --> 01:56:10,837
MARISHA: I want everybody--

1867
01:56:10,837 --> 01:56:12,345
MATT: You might not be able to get Pike.

1868
01:56:12,345 --> 01:56:14,301
MARISHA: I can't get Pike?

1869
01:56:14,301 --> 01:56:16,894
MATT: No, because there would be a weird loop
there.

1870
01:56:16,894 --> 01:56:18,978
ASHLEY: I can maybe try to Sprinter's Boots my way
up.

1871
01:56:18,978 --> 01:56:22,559
MARISHA: Well, as much as I can do, but I want to
make a nice hole to where he's still--

1872
01:56:22,559 --> 01:56:25,174
MATT: I would say you can either get Pike or you
can get these guys here. That's about where you're

1873
01:56:25,174 --> 01:56:26,628
going to call it.

1874
01:56:26,628 --> 01:56:28,480
ASHLEY: No worries. Do some damage!

1875
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:29,753
MATT: What are you going to do?

1876
01:56:29,753 --> 01:56:32,155
MARISHA: I'm going to boost up Pike. She's halfway
underground.

1877
01:56:32,155 --> 01:56:34,703
MATT: The wall comes out and it stops there.
That's as far as you can get it. This whole area

1878
01:56:34,703 --> 01:56:41,091
now is a wall. It pops you out of the stone as the
stone lifts you up. You have to catch yourself for

1879
01:56:41,091 --> 01:56:45,374
a second, but it's not so abrupt to the point
where you get knocked off the side. You're all

1880
01:56:45,374 --> 01:56:50,471
lifted up about ten feet. So just mark that area
as stone wall. Got it.

1881
01:56:50,471 --> 01:56:51,716
MARISHA: Except for douchebag.

1882
01:56:51,716 --> 01:56:52,667
MATT: Except for douchebag.

1883
01:56:52,667 --> 01:56:54,598
SAM: Now that I'm within range, may I go?

1884
01:56:54,598 --> 01:57:00,005
MATT: After Percy, and then it's your turn. You
all get to hold at the same time, so. Percy.

1885
01:57:00,005 --> 01:57:02,564
TALIESIN: Does he get an attack of opportunity if
I run?

1886
01:57:02,564 --> 01:57:04,334
MATT: You don't know.

1887
01:57:04,334 --> 01:57:05,961
TALIESIN: How close am I? I can't see.

1888
01:57:05,961 --> 01:57:07,463
MATT: It took one reaction against Clarota.

1889
01:57:07,463 --> 01:57:10,590
LIAM: You're further than five feet away, because
had you been five feet away I could have sneak

1890
01:57:10,590 --> 01:57:11,790
attacked.

1891
01:57:11,790 --> 01:57:17,077
TALIESIN: Oh. Well, all right. The first thing I'm
going to do is shoot twice in the face of this

1892
01:57:17,077 --> 01:57:18,413
asshole.

1893
01:57:18,413 --> 01:57:20,096
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

1894
01:57:20,096 --> 01:57:23,029
MARISHA: Shoot twice into the face of the asshole,
Percy.

1895
01:57:23,029 --> 01:57:24,561
TALIESIN: 14?

1896
01:57:24,561 --> 01:57:28,106
MATT: 14 does not hit, unfortunately.

1897
01:57:28,106 --> 01:57:29,636
TALIESIN: But 28 will.

1898
01:57:29,636 --> 01:57:32,556
MATT: 28 will. So the first shot, you shoot, the
body just goes (sound of air splitting speed) and

1899
01:57:32,556 --> 01:57:38,272
totally unnatural sense sees where the aim is and
is already out of the way before the bullet gets

1900
01:57:38,272 --> 01:57:42,751
there. Returns, but you catch it up with the
second shot from the Pepperbox, and blast in the

1901
01:57:42,751 --> 01:57:45,245
side of its chest. Go ahead and roll damage.

1902
01:57:45,245 --> 01:57:47,397
TALIESIN: Oh my god. This is awful. Six.

1903
01:57:47,397 --> 01:57:48,683
MATT: Six points of damage. All righty.

1904
01:57:48,683 --> 01:57:49,813
TALIESIN: That's just embarrassing.

1905
01:57:49,813 --> 01:57:51,140
LAURA: That's something, that's something, Percy!

1906
01:57:51,140 --> 01:57:52,426
ASHLEY: Hey, you know what? We're getting close!

1907
01:57:52,426 --> 01:57:54,893
LAURA: That's better than a one.

1908
01:57:54,893 --> 01:57:59,413
MARISHA: Pike is just an inspirational poster
today. Like, it's okay, we can do it!

1909
01:57:59,413 --> 01:58:04,635
TALIESIN: Thanks, mom. All right. Thanks, mom. I'm
going to try to make a run for it to the

1910
01:58:04,635 --> 01:58:06,190
stalactite by your hand.

1911
01:58:06,190 --> 01:58:07,258
MATT: Right here?

1912
01:58:07,258 --> 01:58:12,982
TALIESIN: If I could even climb up on it, that
would be very cool.

1913
01:58:12,982 --> 01:58:17,593
MATT: That's going to, with your run speed, you're
going to have to do that next turn.

1914
01:58:17,593 --> 01:58:19,277
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine.

1915
01:58:19,277 --> 01:58:21,607
MATT: You don't have enough action to do that, but
you get to it. Scanlan, you're up!

1916
01:58:21,607 --> 01:58:26,199
SAM: I'm going to blind him. With Blindness in his
eyes.

1917
01:58:26,199 --> 01:58:28,427
TALIESIN: Try blinding him with science, that
usually works.

1918
01:58:28,427 --> 01:58:29,889
MATT: Are you using your hand cone?

1919
01:58:29,889 --> 01:58:31,175
SAM: I am using my hand cone.

1920
01:58:31,175 --> 01:58:34,375
MATT: I assume you do, for the most part. So
what's your DC with that?

1921
01:58:34,375 --> 01:58:35,539
SAM: 19.

1922
01:58:35,539 --> 01:58:39,779
MATT: Good. All right, fails its roll.

1923
01:58:39,779 --> 01:58:41,721
ORION AND ASHLEY: Yes!

1924
01:58:41,721 --> 01:58:54,429
MATT: As you release the arcane essence, you can
see this darkness spill up and completely cascade

1925
01:58:54,429 --> 01:58:59,328
over the white, almost soulless, freaking out eyes
of this creature. It's very Silent Hill in the way

1926
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:04,553
it moves. Suddenly, its eyes (shhh noise) fill
over with darkness, and you can see it beginning

1927
01:59:04,553 --> 01:59:10,901
to writhe and move around like it's unable to
truly grasp the full surroundings. It appears to

1928
01:59:10,901 --> 01:59:12,130
have taken effect.

1929
01:59:12,130 --> 01:59:13,396
ORION: Nice!

1930
01:59:13,396 --> 01:59:23,762
SAM: And then I give a little inspiration to Pike.
I look over to her, give her a little wink, little

1931
01:59:23,762 --> 01:59:25,188
smile...

1932
01:59:25,188 --> 01:59:26,843
LIAM: Spirit her on with anger. Good job.

1933
01:59:26,843 --> 01:59:28,088
MATT: Take your 1d8 inspiration.

1934
01:59:28,088 --> 01:59:29,419
ASHLEY: 1d8? Okay.

1935
01:59:29,419 --> 01:59:30,489
SAM: That's all it takes.

1936
01:59:30,489 --> 01:59:32,149
MARISHA: That's all it takes. (laughs)

1937
01:59:32,149 --> 01:59:34,465
MATT: All right. That ends your turn, Scanlan?

1938
01:59:34,465 --> 01:59:35,510
SAM: I think so.

1939
01:59:35,510 --> 01:59:36,691
MATT: You're going to stay right there?

1940
01:59:36,691 --> 01:59:37,541
SAM: Where am I?

1941
01:59:37,541 --> 01:59:38,747
MATT: You're on top of the wall, right here.

1942
01:59:38,747 --> 01:59:40,925
SAM: Yeah, I'm staying on that wall, yeah. I don't
want to go anywhere, yeah.

1943
01:59:40,925 --> 01:59:42,643
MATT: Okay. Pike, you're up.

1944
01:59:42,643 --> 01:59:44,333
ASHLEY: Okay. So, from where I'm at--

1945
01:59:44,333 --> 01:59:45,773
MATT: Yes, on top of this wall here.

1946
01:59:45,773 --> 01:59:52,143
ASHLEY: I'm on top of a wall? I'm going to Guiding
Bolt the whatever-it-is.

1947
01:59:52,143 --> 01:59:53,509
(all laugh)

1948
01:59:53,509 --> 01:59:55,003
SAM: The whatever it is.

1949
01:59:55,003 --> 02:00:07,780
ASHLEY: And then-- okay, wait, hold on. Let me
cast that at-- So what do I roll for?

1950
02:00:07,780 --> 02:00:12,460
MATT: You roll and add your spell attack modifier
to it, I believe it is, to hit for Guiding Bolt.

1951
02:00:12,502 --> 02:00:14,312
ASHLEY: So I roll the d20 to see if I hit?

1952
02:00:14,312 --> 02:00:16,217
MATT: I'm pretty sure, yeah. It should be in the
description.

1953
02:00:16,217 --> 02:00:17,634
ASHLEY: Okay.

1954
02:00:17,634 --> 02:00:19,356
LAURA: That's good, that's good!

1955
02:00:19,356 --> 02:00:20,353
ASHLEY: 15.

1956
02:00:20,353 --> 02:00:21,383
LAURA: Plus anything?

1957
02:00:21,383 --> 02:00:23,766
ASHLEY: Oh, plus-- wait, what am I plussing? I'm so
sorry!

1958
02:00:23,766 --> 02:00:25,914
MATT: Your spell attack.

1959
02:00:25,914 --> 02:00:27,874
LAURA: It's on your spell page.

1960
02:00:27,874 --> 02:00:29,301
MATT: It's on your spell page, top of your spell
page.

1961
02:00:29,301 --> 02:00:30,198
ASHLEY: Okay.

1962
02:00:30,198 --> 02:00:31,656
MATT: You haven't used it in a while. Yeah.

1963
02:00:31,656 --> 02:00:33,094
ASHLEY: 23.

1964
02:00:33,094 --> 02:00:34,282
MATT: 23 does hit!

1965
02:00:34,282 --> 02:00:35,308
ASHLEY: Yes!

1966
02:00:35,308 --> 02:00:37,197
ASHLEY: Okay, so then we do--

1967
02:00:37,380 --> 02:00:41,823
MATT: 4d6 points of radiant damage to it.

1968
02:00:41,823 --> 02:00:45,213
SAM: It's also blind.

1969
02:00:45,213 --> 02:00:46,491
MATT: Yes.

1970
02:00:46,491 --> 02:00:55,988
ASHLEY: 15? And I'm going to add my inspiration
from him.

1971
02:00:55,988 --> 02:00:58,420
MATT: You can't add that to damage. It's only to
hit.

1972
02:00:58,420 --> 02:01:00,428
SAM: Save it for later.

1973
02:01:00,428 --> 02:01:02,443
ASHLEY: So, 19.

1974
02:01:02,443 --> 02:01:07,797
MATT: 19. So, as you look down, you grab your holy
symbol, and even though it is cracked,

1975
02:01:07,797 --> 02:01:12,546
you still feel the presence of Sarenrae looking
down upon you. The divine energy coalesces in your

1976
02:01:12,546 --> 02:01:17,422
hand, and you throw it forward with a divine wrath
as it streaks across the air. It slams into the

1977
02:01:17,422 --> 02:01:22,929
side of this weird twisting abomination, and as it
blasts into it you can see its tentacles reel back

1978
02:01:22,929 --> 02:01:27,633
and pull back in severe pain and it roars this
horrible, screeching (bleeegrh screech) scream

1979
02:01:27,633 --> 02:01:32,564
into the cavern around you, echoing down the hall.
It's looking a little rough.

1980
02:01:32,564 --> 02:01:38,072
ASHLEY: Okay. And then there's nothing I can do
from there, right?

1981
02:01:38,072 --> 02:01:41,694
MATT: That's your action. You can move if you'd
like. Move along the wall, or hop off it, or

1982
02:01:41,694 --> 02:01:42,844
whatever you want to do.

1983
02:01:42,844 --> 02:01:44,698
SAM: Come closer to me!

1984
02:01:44,698 --> 02:01:45,794
ASHLEY: I'll stay!

1985
02:01:45,794 --> 02:01:47,963
(all laugh)

1986
02:01:47,963 --> 02:01:49,874
MATT: All right.

1987
02:01:49,874 --> 02:01:53,372
MARISHA: Because she's an independent woman.

1988
02:01:53,372 --> 02:01:59,365
SAM: That's a proud choice, and I honor and
respect it. I love women!

1989
02:01:59,365 --> 02:02:01,969
MATT: So currently, because it's--

1990
02:02:01,969 --> 02:02:04,410
MARISHA: Pike's not the only one cashing karma
points.

1991
02:02:04,410 --> 02:02:09,160
MATT: So technically, I should have remembered
this, but you hit anyway: while it's blinded,

1992
02:02:09,160 --> 02:02:10,872
attacks against it have advantage.

1993
02:02:10,872 --> 02:02:11,817
LAURA: Oh, okay.

1994
02:02:11,817 --> 02:02:14,792
MATT: And its attacks have disadvantage.
So, as a note. Top of the round, now, the

1995
02:02:14,834 --> 02:02:19,598
monstrosity goes ahead and gets its round. It's
going to go ahead and lash outward. Thinks people

1996
02:02:19,598 --> 02:02:31,977
are around it, seeing the wall go up, it's going
to swing out towards you. All right, that is a 16

1997
02:02:31,977 --> 02:02:37,338
versus armor class. Nice! So, as it swings out
towards you on the wall, you duck out of

1998
02:02:37,338 --> 02:02:41,869
the way just in time. A second tendril (whoosh,
swish) reaches out and is going ahead and head

1999
02:02:42,046 --> 02:02:49,638
forward... let's see. This one's probably going to
make its way either between your foot or Scanlan

2000
02:02:49,791 --> 02:03:00,499
on the wall. I'm going to roll to see who it goes
for. Goes for Tiberius. That is 16 versus armor

2001
02:03:00,499 --> 02:03:01,935
class again.

2002
02:03:01,935 --> 02:03:04,725
ORION: No. 17.

2003
02:03:04,725 --> 02:03:10,052
MATT: 17? Nice! Let's see...

2004
02:03:10,052 --> 02:03:12,667
LAURA: On the ground, you look up like...

2005
02:03:12,667 --> 02:03:15,474
ORION: No! My big toe! Bah!

2006
02:03:15,474 --> 02:03:27,891
MATT: Third strike is going to whip around and
attempt to grab... roll between both... Okay, it's

2007
02:03:28,027 --> 02:03:32,706
going to go for Lady Kima. And that's a natural
20.

2008
02:03:32,706 --> 02:03:33,979
LAURA: Oh.

2009
02:03:33,979 --> 02:03:38,203
TALIESIN: She's a magnet.

2010
02:03:38,203 --> 02:03:39,992
MARISHA: Even with disadvantage?

2011
02:03:39,992 --> 02:03:44,790
MATT: Well, actually, no, technically it would've
still been a 15, so it's not a critical, but it

2012
02:03:44,790 --> 02:03:45,793
still hits.

2013
02:03:45,793 --> 02:03:47,405
MARISHA: That's good.

2014
02:03:47,405 --> 02:03:51,133
MATT: Unfortunately, without her full armor, her
AC is not that crazy. So it's not a critical.

2015
02:03:51,133 --> 02:03:58,538
That's nice. That brings it to a total of 18
points of damage with an additional six acid

2016
02:03:58,538 --> 02:04:00,162
damage to Lady Kima.

2017
02:04:00,162 --> 02:04:04,155
LAURA: Oh. Acid. None of us have gotten hit yet.

2018
02:04:04,155 --> 02:04:07,848
MATT: And the tentacle (whoosh) wraps around her
and grapples her in place, and she's currently

2019
02:04:07,848 --> 02:04:18,931
held in place by its tentacle. She stays where she
is. It is now going to attempt to leap away. It

2020
02:04:18,983 --> 02:04:22,953
brings all of its tentacles to the ground and
(whoosh) leaps up into the air.

2021
02:04:22,953 --> 02:04:24,496
LIAM: Attacking before it goes.

2022
02:04:24,496 --> 02:04:26,553
MATT: You get one attack of opportunity against
it.

2023
02:04:26,553 --> 02:04:29,023
LIAM: 27.

2024
02:04:29,023 --> 02:04:30,296
MATT: 27 does hit.

2025
02:04:30,296 --> 02:04:32,542
ORION: I swing at it with my cane as I'm on the
floor.

2026
02:04:32,542 --> 02:04:33,809
MATT: No.

2027
02:04:33,809 --> 02:04:35,153
SAM: Do I get an attack?

2028
02:04:35,153 --> 02:04:36,563
LIAM: 11.

2029
02:04:36,563 --> 02:04:44,525
MATT: 11 points of damage? All right. It takes 11,
and it leaps away, (whoosh) taking her with it,

2030
02:04:44,525 --> 02:04:52,335
and here, it's actually going to land about there,
and you can see as it leaps away and lands, the

2031
02:04:52,335 --> 02:04:55,239
wounds you guys have left on it are slowly
healing.

2032
02:04:55,239 --> 02:04:56,852
MARISHA: Son of a bitch!

2033
02:04:56,852 --> 02:04:57,763
MATT: Vex, you're up.

2034
02:04:57,763 --> 02:05:03,267
LAURA: All right. I don't want to hit Lady Kima
with any of my attacks, so I'm just going to have

2035
02:05:03,267 --> 02:05:07,821
to do... I'm going to do the Blazing Bowstring
again.

2036
02:05:07,821 --> 02:05:08,915
MATT: Okay.

2037
02:05:08,915 --> 02:05:10,529
LAURA: And I'm going to attack it twice.

2038
02:05:10,529 --> 02:05:13,553
MATT: All right. Go for it. Roll for strikes.

2039
02:05:13,690 --> 02:05:16,994
LAURA: Ooh! That was a 30!

2040
02:05:16,994 --> 02:05:20,373
MATT: You have advantage on these strikes, by the
way. Well, actually, let me see, because I think

2041
02:05:20,373 --> 02:05:25,045
it gets a save each turn to try to get rid of your
blindness, which it does not make.

2042
02:05:25,045 --> 02:05:26,157
ORION: Nice. Is he blind?

2043
02:05:26,157 --> 02:05:27,703
MATT: Okay. So still blinded.

2044
02:05:27,703 --> 02:05:28,947
LAURA: 29.

2045
02:05:28,947 --> 02:05:29,984
MATT: Hits. Definitely.

2046
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:32,648
LAURA: And 23.

2047
02:05:32,648 --> 02:05:36,409
MATT: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage on both
attacks. First one with the extra d10 for Blazing

2048
02:05:36,409 --> 02:05:40,260
Bowstring. This arrow: once again, you pull out,
burst into flame (whoosh). The heat is a bit

2049
02:05:40,260 --> 02:05:43,946
strong for your face, but you release it forward;
it actually impacts into your damage. Streaks

2050
02:05:43,946 --> 02:05:46,561
across with an arc of fire, and slamming into its
side, dealing?

2051
02:05:46,561 --> 02:05:52,818
LAURA: 14 points of damage on the first one.

2052
02:05:52,818 --> 02:05:54,084
MATT: All right. Second one?

2053
02:05:54,084 --> 02:05:59,731
LAURA: (laughs) What did I do on that? That was
weird. 14 on the second one as well.

2054
02:05:59,731 --> 02:06:01,166
MATT: Nice! All right.

2055
02:06:01,166 --> 02:06:04,937
ASHLEY: And can I cast War God's Blessing on her
and give her a plus ten? For an attack roll?

2056
02:06:04,937 --> 02:06:12,132
MATT: She's already attacked, but to other people,
you can. And you can do it after they roll. If

2057
02:06:12,132 --> 02:06:15,476
somebody rolls and you're like, that's a really
bad roll, you can be like, plus ten! and it

2058
02:06:15,476 --> 02:06:21,203
might give them enough to push them over the edge.
It's not for damage.

2059
02:06:21,203 --> 02:06:23,253
ASHLEY: It's not for damage. It's for--

2060
02:06:23,253 --> 02:06:25,156
MATT: Attacking, to make sure you hit them.

2061
02:06:25,156 --> 02:06:26,745
ASHLEY: I understand. Okay, great.

2062
02:06:26,745 --> 02:06:30,487
LAURA: But with Hunter's Mark-- she's still
Hunter's Marked!

2063
02:06:30,487 --> 02:06:32,267
MATT: Correct. Oh, did you not roll that damage?

2064
02:06:32,267 --> 02:06:34,107
LAURA: Four.

2065
02:06:34,107 --> 02:06:36,274
MATT: All right. Extra four damage from the
Hunter's Mark. Tiberius.

2066
02:06:36,274 --> 02:06:37,708
ORION: Yes.

2067
02:06:37,708 --> 02:06:41,157
MATT: So, do you get up? You're currently lying on
the top of the wall.

2068
02:06:41,157 --> 02:06:45,424
ORION: I look around, and I don't like what I see,
and I try to get up.

2069
02:06:45,424 --> 02:06:48,136
MATT: Okay. You (grunts) stand back up. You're
currently at the top of the wall;

2070
02:06:48,136 --> 02:06:49,679
it's ten feet up.

2071
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:57,612
ORION: Really? Okay, where's he again? All I see
is mountains. Oh, I see, you put the yellow ring

2072
02:06:57,612 --> 02:07:02,016
around him? And Kima's to the right of him?

2073
02:07:02,016 --> 02:07:04,668
LAURA: Kima's being held by him.

2074
02:07:04,668 --> 02:07:22,400
ORION: Oh, okay. Great. I look at him, see what's
going on. I (ping) my Ioun Stone, and I conjure

2075
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:30,754
out Telekinesis from it, and I guide it towards
the monster's tentacle to unwrap it off Kima, and

2076
02:07:30,754 --> 02:07:32,376
I attempt to pull it off her.

2077
02:07:32,376 --> 02:07:34,320
MATT: Go ahead and make an arcana check.

2078
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:35,761
LIAM: That's Telekinesis, Kyle!

2079
02:07:35,761 --> 02:07:37,699
(all laugh)

2080
02:07:37,699 --> 02:07:40,968
ORION: Sweet! 20.

2081
02:07:40,968 --> 02:07:47,068
MATT: 20? All right. As you focus your
Telekinesis, the tentacle begins to shake and is

2082
02:07:47,068 --> 02:07:51,076
pulled off her body. Kima wrenches herself free.
She is not currently grappled.

2083
02:07:51,076 --> 02:07:53,449
ORION: Can I also go like, (bash) Stop hitting
yourself!

2084
02:07:53,449 --> 02:07:56,371
(all laugh)

2085
02:07:56,371 --> 02:08:01,837
MATT: The tentacle starts slapping around its
body, and it looks confused. It's not enough to do

2086
02:08:01,837 --> 02:08:06,878
any damage, but it looks unsure as to why it's
having a hard time controlling its own limbs.

2087
02:08:06,878 --> 02:08:08,198
ORION: I give a nod to Kima.

2088
02:08:08,198 --> 02:08:10,615
MATT: (laughs) Well done.

2089
02:08:10,615 --> 02:08:11,723
ORION: That's my turn.

2090
02:08:11,723 --> 02:08:13,516
MATT: All right, cool. Vax, you're up.

2091
02:08:13,516 --> 02:08:17,089
LIAM: I'm still hasted, so I'm going to use a
bonus action to go stealth.

2092
02:08:17,089 --> 02:08:20,637
MATT: All right. It can't see you, by the way.

2093
02:08:20,637 --> 02:08:21,979
LIAM: What?

2094
02:08:21,979 --> 02:08:23,305
MATT: It's blinded.

2095
02:08:23,305 --> 02:08:27,694
LIAM: Oh, it's blinded? But do I still need that
to sneak attack, though? Or does it matter? Never

2096
02:08:27,694 --> 02:08:33,268
mind. I'm running at it, and since Kima's right
there, I'm going to stab the bejesus out of it.

2097
02:08:33,268 --> 02:08:34,955
MATT: Go for it!

2098
02:08:34,955 --> 02:08:37,238
LIAM: I'm going to use Luck on that roll.

2099
02:08:37,289 --> 02:08:39,030
MATT: Okay. Well, you have advantage, remember,
because it's blinded.

2100
02:08:39,030 --> 02:08:43,070
LIAM: Okay, great. So that is a 29.

2101
02:08:43,070 --> 02:08:44,284
MATT: 29 hits.

2102
02:08:44,284 --> 02:08:45,282
LIAM: Okay.

2103
02:08:45,282 --> 02:08:58,197
(incoherent mumbling)

2104
02:08:58,197 --> 02:09:01,398
LIAM: Which part gets doubled? I always forget.

2105
02:09:01,398 --> 02:09:02,636
MATT: It's the dice.

2106
02:09:02,636 --> 02:09:12,659
LIAM: So 19 goes to 38, and then the damage gets
added to that, right?

2107
02:09:12,659 --> 02:09:13,918
MATT: Correct.

2108
02:09:13,918 --> 02:09:16,792
LIAM: With the sneak attack, and the damage gets
doubled--

2109
02:09:16,792 --> 02:09:19,310
MATT: Correct, and then the bonus at the end gets
added on to that.

2110
02:09:19,310 --> 02:09:24,294
LIAM: The bonus at the end. Okay, all right. So
what that is is 47.

2111
02:09:24,294 --> 02:09:28,912
MATT: 47 points of damage. Oof. So as you rush
past, you (swoosh) slam the blade into the side.

2112
02:09:28,912 --> 02:09:32,543
You see where part of it seems to start and open,
but it's starting to close up again. You reopen

2113
02:09:32,543 --> 02:09:35,530
that seam and drag across, leaving a giant wound
across its side.

2114
02:09:35,530 --> 02:09:40,251
LIAM: Okay, and then with that knife in, I'm going
to stick the other knife in and attempt to attack

2115
02:09:40,251 --> 02:09:47,844
it and then drag it to the ground. Grapple it to
the ground with my body as I attack. Second attack

2116
02:09:47,844 --> 02:09:49,485
is a 25.

2117
02:09:49,485 --> 02:09:50,893
MATT: 25 hits.

2118
02:09:50,893 --> 02:09:53,120
LIAM: Okay. That's seven.

2119
02:09:53,120 --> 02:09:55,130
MATT: Are you doing damage, or you grappling him?

2120
02:09:55,130 --> 02:09:56,815
LIAM: I'll grapple.

2121
02:09:56,815 --> 02:09:59,744
MATT: Okay, so there's no damage on this. Go ahead
and make an athletics check.

2122
02:09:59,744 --> 02:10:02,124
LIAM: Okay. 20. Natural 20.

2123
02:10:02,124 --> 02:10:04,718
(all cheer)

2124
02:10:04,718 --> 02:10:13,420
MATT: Nice! So you grab it, and you pull it. You
have it currently held. Its physical body is

2125
02:10:13,420 --> 02:10:18,142
pulled to the ground, and you can see its arms are
trying to pull it up off the ground, and (slurpy

2126
02:10:18,142 --> 02:10:23,445
noises) flipping around. Complete chaos in the
air. You imagine you'll probably have a hard time

2127
02:10:23,445 --> 02:10:26,250
holding it down, but for now it's currently
blinded and grappled.

2128
02:10:26,250 --> 02:10:28,032
LIAM: With haste, I have a third attack.

2129
02:10:28,032 --> 02:10:29,116
MATT: You do.

2130
02:10:29,116 --> 02:10:32,558
LIAM: I'm going to drag across its throat. That is
a 25.

2131
02:10:32,558 --> 02:10:33,550
MATT: That hits.

2132
02:10:33,550 --> 02:10:36,869
LIAM: And that's seven.

2133
02:10:36,869 --> 02:10:40,181
MATT: You don't get the bonus-- oh, for the extra
attack you do, because it's with your main arm.

2134
02:10:40,181 --> 02:10:46,553
So, seven damage? All right. Cool. You bring the
blade across, and you can see the blood begin to

2135
02:10:46,553 --> 02:10:51,123
pour out from it, and as it does, you can see the
throat opens up, and where you cut on the throat

2136
02:10:51,123 --> 02:10:58,598
you can see what looks like white gleaming teeth
on the inside of its throat. The entire interior

2137
02:10:58,598 --> 02:11:01,186
of its trachea is coated with teeth.

2138
02:11:01,186 --> 02:11:03,864
ALL: (noises of disgust)

2139
02:11:03,864 --> 02:11:05,754
SAM: It has a maw?

2140
02:11:05,754 --> 02:11:10,830
MATT: Kima's turn. Kima sees you holding it down.
Takes the sword, swings it, and is going to come

2141
02:11:10,830 --> 02:11:22,530
on down, spending a level-three spell as a Divine
Smite against it. That hits with a 22. This

2142
02:11:22,664 --> 02:11:25,201
advantage is kicking its ass. Second attack.

2143
02:11:25,201 --> 02:11:26,814
LAURA: Nice Blind, Scanlan.

2144
02:11:26,814 --> 02:11:41,315
MATT: Oof. Yeah. Both hit. All right. 36 points of
damage, and a divine strike. And 12 points on the

2145
02:11:41,315 --> 02:11:45,701
second blow. As she comes down and slams it with
the big sword twice, the first one arcing down

2146
02:11:45,701 --> 02:11:52,149
with divine energy, streaking across the
barely-lit cavernous area. It hits the ground, and

2147
02:11:52,149 --> 02:11:58,665
it splatters blood across. You can see one of its
tentacles is barely hanging on by just a section

2148
02:11:58,665 --> 02:12:04,603
of muscle and sinew. However, she looks down real
fast, and you can see now these skeletal hands are

2149
02:12:04,603 --> 02:12:10,241
reaching up and grabbing her legs and starting to
pull her down. She's going to attempt to try--

2150
02:12:10,241 --> 02:12:11,263
ORION: Kima?

2151
02:12:11,263 --> 02:12:12,420
MATT AND LAURA: Kima.

2152
02:12:12,420 --> 02:12:13,766
LAURA: Oh, I wonder if that's going to happen to
all of us.

2153
02:12:13,766 --> 02:12:17,703
MATT: She's unable to break from that. She's now
being pulled down into the ground beneath her.

2154
02:12:17,703 --> 02:12:26,502
That brings us to Clarota's turn. Clarota is going
to move--

2155
02:12:26,502 --> 02:12:29,693
MARISHA: Who all is on the dance floor?

2156
02:12:29,693 --> 02:12:32,339
MATT: Ugh, can't do this.

2157
02:12:32,339 --> 02:12:34,153
LAURA: All of us except for Percy, I think.

2158
02:12:34,153 --> 02:12:45,689
MATT: Clarota's going to stand here and pull back
and begin to coalesce this bluish crackling energy

2159
02:12:45,689 --> 02:12:50,331
in Clarota's hand. The tentacles of Clarota's face
begin to swirl and pull back into this horrible

2160
02:12:50,331 --> 02:12:56,229
grimace as it releases this bolt of lighting
energy that arcs past, just overhead of where Kima

2161
02:12:56,229 --> 02:13:03,893
is, since Kima's been pulled down below. Lightning
Bolt. Two ones in a row, are you fucking kidding

2162
02:13:03,893 --> 02:13:07,692
me? I'm rolling terribly tonight, guys, by the
way.

2163
02:13:07,692 --> 02:13:10,391
LIAM: It's mostly in our favor.

2164
02:13:10,391 --> 02:13:16,555
MATT: Yeah. So that Lightning Bolt would do 15
points of damage. With disadvantage on its save.

2165
02:13:16,555 --> 02:13:21,910
Still makes it, so (laughs) with a Lightning Bolt
that does a grand total of seven points of

2166
02:13:21,910 --> 02:13:23,520
damage--

2167
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:26,428
LAURA: It's better than one, Clarota! It's better
than one!

2168
02:13:26,428 --> 02:13:34,358
MATT: Clarota looks away dejectedly. "It was the
best I could do." All right. Keyleth, you're up.

2169
02:13:34,358 --> 02:13:43,396
MARISHA: All right. Seeing Lady Kima slowly
getting taken under, I make eye contact with her.

2170
02:13:43,396 --> 02:13:44,698
MATT: All right.

2171
02:13:44,698 --> 02:13:45,952
MARISHA: What?

2172
02:13:45,952 --> 02:13:46,988
MATT: No, continue.

2173
02:13:46,988 --> 02:13:54,706
MARISHA: Okay. And I make a Grasping Vine from
that stalactite over there.

2174
02:13:54,706 --> 02:13:55,694
MATT: Here?

2175
02:13:55,694 --> 02:14:01,437
MARISHA: Yes. And I'm going to take it and wrap it
around Lady Kima and try to yank her out.

2176
02:14:01,437 --> 02:14:08,151
MATT: Okay. All right. So as the vine pulls out of
the side of this rock (whoosh), it reaches out and

2177
02:14:08,151 --> 02:14:10,609
wraps itself around her body and begins to pull.

2178
02:14:10,609 --> 02:14:13,462
MARISHA: Around her waist. Not her neck, again.

2179
02:14:13,462 --> 02:14:14,972
MATT: Right.

2180
02:14:14,972 --> 02:14:16,124
MARISHA: Yeah.

2181
02:14:16,124 --> 02:14:17,067
(all laugh)

2182
02:14:17,067 --> 02:14:19,817
MATT: Good distinction. All right.

2183
02:14:19,817 --> 02:14:21,341
MARISHA: Just wanting that out there.

2184
02:14:21,341 --> 02:14:29,505
MATT: Yeah. It's a good thing. So, Grasping
Vine... yeah, okay. So it pulls 20 feet; she gets

2185
02:14:29,505 --> 02:14:34,361
pulled 20 feet. I'll go ahead and say, make a
wisdom check.

2186
02:14:34,361 --> 02:14:35,931
MARISHA: I'm trying not to hurt her.

2187
02:14:35,931 --> 02:14:40,036
MATT: Right, I understand. This is more your
strength of will versus the strength of

2188
02:14:40,036 --> 02:14:40,798
whatever--

2189
02:14:40,798 --> 02:14:42,382
MARISHA: Just adding my wisdom?

2190
02:14:42,382 --> 02:14:43,209
MATT: Yep.

2191
02:14:43,209 --> 02:14:44,443
MARISHA: 20. Total.

2192
02:14:44,443 --> 02:14:49,315
MATT: 20. So, as the vine wraps around her and
begins to pull, she reaches over and grabs the

2193
02:14:49,315 --> 02:14:53,841
vine for extra strength, and (fwoomp) it pulls her
out of the wall. She goes flying over and lands at

2194
02:14:53,841 --> 02:14:57,072
the side of the stone with a vine that's still
loosely wrapped around her, but it's definitely

2195
02:14:57,072 --> 02:14:58,633
pulled her free of the floor.

2196
02:14:58,633 --> 02:15:04,144
MARISHA: Can I leave it to where it's holding her
up, to where it's not touching?

2197
02:15:04,144 --> 02:15:08,073
MATT: Sure! Yeah. She's currently held aloft by
this vine that strapped her. She's looking

2198
02:15:08,073 --> 02:15:12,481
confused. Thankful, but also wants to be let go.

2199
02:15:12,481 --> 02:15:16,829
MARISHA: Can I take a bonus action to shout at
her? Be like, "Calm down Kima! Jeez!"

2200
02:15:16,829 --> 02:15:20,069
MATT: Sure. Is that the end of your turn?

2201
02:15:20,069 --> 02:15:21,293
MARISHA: Yes!

2202
02:15:21,293 --> 02:15:24,635
MATT: Okay! As you finish casting the spell and
shouting at her, you look down and notice the

2203
02:15:24,635 --> 02:15:27,094
ground. (swish, shoosh) Begins pulling you down

2204
02:15:27,094 --> 02:15:31,135
MARISHA: No, I'm still on the stalactites. I
haven't moved off the stalactite!

2205
02:15:31,135 --> 02:15:33,657
I'm straddling it.

2206
02:15:33,657 --> 02:15:37,622
ASHLEY: A little straddle action!

2207
02:15:37,622 --> 02:15:40,631
MARISHA: I'm riding that stalactite

2208
02:15:40,631 --> 02:15:42,007
MATT: Go ahead.

2209
02:15:42,007 --> 02:15:45,028
MARISHA: Riding it side-saddle.

2210
02:15:45,028 --> 02:15:50,826
MATT: It's really hard to be on top of that and
cast spells and talk about this. (chuckling) It's

2211
02:15:50,826 --> 02:15:56,629
a giant piece. I'm going to say, go ahead and make
an athletics check.

2212
02:15:56,629 --> 02:16:04,613
MARISHA: All right. Ooh! 24.

2213
02:16:04,613 --> 02:16:10,373
MATT: Okay! You manage to precariously stay on the
top of this stalactite, holding on to it, casting

2214
02:16:10,373 --> 02:16:12,818
spells and shouting out. All right.

2215
02:16:12,818 --> 02:16:15,513
MARISHA: Jeez, Kima! Stop! This is hard already!

2216
02:16:15,513 --> 02:16:16,794
MATT: Percy!

2217
02:16:16,794 --> 02:16:21,359
TALIESIN: I'm going to crawl and find myself a
seat on top of that stalactite. That's my first

2218
02:16:21,359 --> 02:16:22,882
thing I'm going to do.

2219
02:16:22,882 --> 02:16:26,234
MATT: Okay, well, at the start of your turn, make
a dexterity check.

2220
02:16:28,450 --> 02:16:29,770
TALIESIN: 20!

2221
02:16:29,770 --> 02:16:33,504
MATT: All right. You manage to pull out. Now make
an athletics check to try and make your way up to

2222
02:16:33,504 --> 02:16:34,947
the top of this rock.

2223
02:16:34,947 --> 02:16:36,395
TALIESIN: Athletics or acrobatics?

2224
02:16:36,395 --> 02:16:38,403
MATT: This would be athletics, just to pull
yourself up on the side.

2225
02:16:38,403 --> 02:16:39,952
MARISHA: Rock climbing check.

2226
02:16:40,629 --> 02:16:41,830
TALIESIN: 13.

2227
02:16:41,830 --> 02:16:47,920
MATT: 13. Okay! You can decide whether or not you
want to attempt to ascend this or make any attacks

2228
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:53,007
this turn, because right now it's going to take
your full round to get to the top of this. It's a

2229
02:16:53,007 --> 02:16:56,672
very thin, jagged, almost vertical wall you're
trying to climb up and hold onto.

2230
02:16:56,672 --> 02:17:01,027
TALIESIN: How far away am I from the stones? From
the platform?

2231
02:17:01,027 --> 02:17:02,682
MATT: From the platform here?

2232
02:17:02,682 --> 02:17:04,709
TALIESIN: From something I can stand on that's not
sand.

2233
02:17:04,709 --> 02:17:09,692
MATT: You're probably about 35 feet.

2234
02:17:09,692 --> 02:17:11,766
TALIESIN: So I could make it in a run?

2235
02:17:11,766 --> 02:17:13,359
MATT: You could make it in a run, yeah.

2236
02:17:13,359 --> 02:17:15,328
TALIESIN: All right. I mean, in a standard
movement action?

2237
02:17:15,328 --> 02:17:18,374
MATT: No. You'd almost make it.

2238
02:17:18,374 --> 02:17:19,952
ORION: What's your movement?

2239
02:17:19,952 --> 02:17:23,238
TALIESIN: My movement is 30. Just almost make it?

2240
02:17:23,238 --> 02:17:29,533
MATT: Yeah. Right now, this wall's blocking you
from even seeing the creature. As far as you know,

2241
02:17:29,533 --> 02:17:31,967
you see a giant wall and you hear fighting on the
other side of it.

2242
02:17:31,967 --> 02:17:39,016
TALIESIN: I'll make it to the top of the
stalactite, then.

2243
02:17:39,016 --> 02:17:43,576
MATT: Okay, so. (grunts) You get up to the top.
I'll put this here as a reminder. But that's where

2244
02:17:43,576 --> 02:17:48,301
you are right now. Okay, that ends your turn.
Scanlan!

2245
02:17:48,301 --> 02:17:54,279
SAM: Is there anywhere I can stay on the dance
floor and get a line of sight with the creature?

2246
02:17:54,279 --> 02:17:59,974
MATT: I'll say you'll be able to get right up next
to Tiberius, right here, and be able to get line

2247
02:17:59,974 --> 02:18:01,119
of sight.

2248
02:18:01,119 --> 02:18:03,896
SAM: And can I throw lightning and not hit
Tiberius?

2249
02:18:03,896 --> 02:18:05,192
MATT: No.

2250
02:18:05,192 --> 02:18:19,203
SAM: (nervous laugh) Okay, then. Then I don't do
that. Instead, I will-- I've got nothing to do!

2251
02:18:19,203 --> 02:18:27,172
Let's say I will try to-- is she-- it's a he.

2252
02:18:27,172 --> 02:18:28,512
MATT: It's a he.

2253
02:18:28,512 --> 02:18:30,021
TALIESIN: It's a he! God!

2254
02:18:30,021 --> 02:18:37,031
SAM: I have no ranged attacks. Except I can
Viciously Mock it, so that's what I'll do. I'll

2255
02:18:37,031 --> 02:18:45,128
say, you know what? Your tentacles make you look
kind of fat, and the elf thing is played out. It's

2256
02:18:45,128 --> 02:18:55,773
sort of 1990s. Orlando Bloom. And the whole bone
thing is just really tacky!

2257
02:18:55,773 --> 02:18:59,713
ORION: I look at Scanlan curiously. (laughs)

2258
02:18:59,713 --> 02:19:05,492
MATT: Tiberius looks over. You look over your
shoulder at at Scanlan with a curious look. Rolled

2259
02:19:05,492 --> 02:19:11,984
a four. So essentially, being blind, all it can
rely on right now is audio sensation around it.

2260
02:19:11,984 --> 02:19:17,515
And it picks up ringing through the air. What hint
and shred of humanity is within its psyche

2261
02:19:17,515 --> 02:19:22,647
understands the Common you speak in its direction.
And for a moment, it seems to sag all its

2262
02:19:22,647 --> 02:19:26,355
tentacles. Go ahead and roll damage for your
Vicious Mockery.

2263
02:19:26,355 --> 02:19:34,393
SAM: Three! Yes! It's the only ranged attack I
have.

2264
02:19:34,393 --> 02:19:36,647
(all laugh)

2265
02:19:36,647 --> 02:19:39,272
MATT: I was just seeing if there's another effect
of Vicious Mockery.

2266
02:19:39,272 --> 02:19:40,733
ORION: He's sad for a while. (laughs)

2267
02:19:40,733 --> 02:19:42,050
MATT: Is there anything else it does?

2268
02:19:42,050 --> 02:19:43,088
ASHLEY: He's dead!

2269
02:19:43,088 --> 02:19:45,336
MARISHA: Yeah, he just dies!

2270
02:19:45,336 --> 02:19:47,023
ORION: Negative two to self-esteem.

2271
02:19:47,023 --> 02:19:50,165
MATT: Vicious Mockery-- has disadvantage on--
okay! So it has disadvantage on disadvantage on

2272
02:19:50,165 --> 02:19:52,566
its next attack. Got it!

2273
02:19:52,566 --> 02:19:54,065
TALIESIN: Does that mean it has triple?

2274
02:19:54,065 --> 02:19:56,692
MATT: Nah. If it did, that would be awesome. Pike,
you're up!

2275
02:19:56,692 --> 02:20:04,522
SAM: Oh! And as my bonus action, I'm going to
inspire somebody. I don't know. Who? I look over

2276
02:20:04,522 --> 02:20:07,984
at Liam and I do-- sorry, Vax. And I do one of
these.

2277
02:20:07,984 --> 02:20:10,870
(all laugh)

2278
02:20:10,870 --> 02:20:13,673
MATT: All right. You are strangely inspired by
that.

2279
02:20:13,673 --> 02:20:16,073
LIAM: I giggle-snort.

2280
02:20:16,073 --> 02:20:18,471
MATT: Okay. That brings us to Pike. You're up.

2281
02:20:18,471 --> 02:20:22,292
ASHLEY: Okay, so where are we at? I'm so sorry. I
can't see.

2282
02:20:22,292 --> 02:20:25,538
MATT: You're right there, on top of the wall, on
the far back end. You can't even see the entity.

2283
02:20:25,538 --> 02:20:28,935
It's way off to the side and a bunch of people are
in a row on top of a wall that Keyleth created.

2284
02:20:28,935 --> 02:20:35,034
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to use my Sprinter's
Boots and get over. Everybody's healed; everybody

2285
02:20:35,034 --> 02:20:36,660
hasn't really taken too many hit points?

2286
02:20:36,660 --> 02:20:38,727
MATT: You've guys rolled really well and it has
rolled terribly.

2287
02:20:38,727 --> 02:20:43,468
ASHLEY: So I'm going to go around here. Oh, I
don't know, can I have--

2288
02:20:43,468 --> 02:20:49,499
MATT: It's a very thin wall. Make an acrobatics
check to try and move and tumble through the

2289
02:20:49,499 --> 02:20:51,898
people. With disadvantage because you're in heavy
plate armor.

2290
02:20:51,898 --> 02:20:53,409
SAM: But you've got inspiration.

2291
02:20:53,409 --> 02:20:54,872
MATT: You do.

2292
02:20:54,872 --> 02:20:56,673
LIAM: You can add that to your roll. So add
inspiration.

2293
02:20:56,673 --> 02:20:57,870
MATT: Roll twice. You're at disadvantage.

2294
02:20:57,870 --> 02:21:00,948
LAURA: 13.

2295
02:21:00,948 --> 02:21:02,044
ASHLEY: What, plus eight?

2296
02:21:02,414 --> 02:21:04,658
SAM: You can roll a d8.

2297
02:21:04,658 --> 02:21:05,871
LIAM: It's advantage, so pick the higher.

2298
02:21:05,871 --> 02:21:07,786
MATT: No, disadvantage, because she's in heavy
armor.

2299
02:21:07,786 --> 02:21:09,460
LIAM: Oh oh oh.

2300
02:21:09,460 --> 02:21:10,379
ASHLEY: 16.

2301
02:21:10,379 --> 02:21:14,833
MATT: 16? You just manage to barely squeeze
through people without falling off of the top of

2302
02:21:14,833 --> 02:21:16,655
the wall, finding yourself right there.

2303
02:21:16,655 --> 02:21:21,833
ASHLEY: Okay. So then, since I'm there, I'm going
to cast Guiding Bolt again.

2304
02:21:21,833 --> 02:21:23,062
MATT: Okay.

2305
02:21:23,062 --> 02:21:30,917
ASHLEY: And then I'm going to cast it at 4th level
again. And then, which is--

2306
02:21:30,917 --> 02:21:39,066
MATT: Roll to attack twice. You have to roll to
hit it first. Roll twice, because it is blinded

2307
02:21:39,066 --> 02:21:43,428
and has disadvantage. You have advantage on it, I
mean.

2308
02:21:43,428 --> 02:21:44,737
ASHLEY: 18.

2309
02:21:44,737 --> 02:21:46,181
LAURA: Plus your spell thing?

2310
02:21:46,181 --> 02:21:47,236
MATT: 18 plus your spell.

2311
02:21:47,236 --> 02:21:50,662
ASHLEY: Oh, which would be 26.

2312
02:21:50,662 --> 02:21:55,618
MATT: That does hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
You are at 4th level, that is 7d6 damage.

2313
02:21:55,618 --> 02:21:59,856
ORION: Nice! Holy crap.

2314
02:21:59,856 --> 02:22:08,487
SAM: Pike, perhaps you should spare it for your
god, or offer it in sacrifice to your god?

2315
02:22:08,487 --> 02:22:11,825
ASHLEY: Sorry, guys.

2316
02:22:11,825 --> 02:22:13,844
TALIESIN: That's a lot of math.

2317
02:22:13,844 --> 02:22:15,660
SAM: You know what? Women are good at math.

2318
02:22:15,660 --> 02:22:16,605
ORION: They are.

2319
02:22:16,605 --> 02:22:18,073
TALIESIN: They are.

2320
02:22:18,073 --> 02:22:19,836
SAM: Probably better than men.

2321
02:22:19,836 --> 02:22:21,291
ORION: I would say probably.

2322
02:22:21,291 --> 02:22:22,696
ASHLEY: And then do I add anything?

2323
02:22:22,696 --> 02:22:24,187
MATT: No, that's just the 7d6.

2324
02:22:24,187 --> 02:22:25,096
ASHLEY: 26.

2325
02:22:25,096 --> 02:22:26,410
MATT: 26 damage, nice!

2326
02:22:26,410 --> 02:22:27,782
SAM: Good adding.

2327
02:22:27,782 --> 02:22:28,799
ASHLEY: Hey, thanks!

2328
02:22:28,799 --> 02:22:31,620
MATT: As you pull through the rest of the crowd,
you stand next to someone, you grab your holy

2329
02:22:31,620 --> 02:22:37,276
symbol again. This time, looking up to your hand.
This divine energy materializes and shines down in

2330
02:22:37,276 --> 02:22:41,017
a god ray onto your hand as you gather it with
your fingers, it seems to formulate this actual

2331
02:22:41,017 --> 02:22:46,474
thick rock feeling sensation. You swing it
underhand softball pitch with absolute furious

2332
02:22:46,474 --> 02:22:49,523
anger that slams into the side of the creature,
bursting with the divine energy, doing a very

2333
02:22:49,523 --> 02:22:56,165
sincerely impressive amount of damage for a small
Guiding Bolt. It's currently still trying to get

2334
02:22:56,165 --> 02:23:00,379
back up after Vax has been holding it to the
ground. You can see it blast its side. You are

2335
02:23:00,379 --> 02:23:03,350
almost pulled over on top of it by the sheer force
of the impact.

2336
02:23:03,350 --> 02:23:06,246
ASHLEY: Sorry, Vax!

2337
02:23:06,246 --> 02:23:08,676
MATT: That brings us to the top of it now.

2338
02:23:08,676 --> 02:23:09,980
SAM: It's still alive?

2339
02:23:09,980 --> 02:23:11,295
ASHLEY: It's still alive?!

2340
02:23:11,295 --> 02:23:13,067
LIAM: It's got that healing factor.

2341
02:23:13,067 --> 02:23:14,988
SAM: Can we undo its healing factor?

2342
02:23:14,988 --> 02:23:20,445
MATT: After all the impact, all the sounds it's
hearing, it moves over to this vicinity.

2343
02:23:20,445 --> 02:23:22,272
LIAM: Ain't he grappled?

2344
02:23:22,272 --> 02:23:24,566
MATT: Oh, you're holding it here.

2345
02:23:24,566 --> 02:23:25,765
LIAM: I'm holding it.

2346
02:23:25,765 --> 02:23:27,296
MATT: It's going to attempt to break from your
grapple.

2347
02:23:27,296 --> 02:23:28,336
LIAM: Good luck.

2348
02:23:28,336 --> 02:23:30,214
MATT: So you make an acrobatics check.

2349
02:23:30,214 --> 02:23:31,820
LIAM: Do I get advantage on this?

2350
02:23:31,820 --> 02:23:34,587
MATT: For this check, you do, I believe.

2351
02:23:34,587 --> 02:23:37,358
LIAM: Okay, good. 27.

2352
02:23:37,358 --> 02:23:46,828
MATT: 27? 29. It slips out of your grasp, moves
over to this vicinity here. And you can see now,

2353
02:23:46,828 --> 02:23:52,586
the tendrils open up, even though its eyes can't
see. You can see what looks like a bunch of gills

2354
02:23:52,756 --> 02:23:58,477
across its body, slits in its torso and it almost
looks like all of them open up into these tiny

2355
02:23:58,477 --> 02:24:04,960
little mouths. You can also see teeth rippling
through them and expels this cloud of green gas

2356
02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:12,593
that (fssh) around everyone within ten feet of
it. Everyone on the wall, right here. Clarota--

2357
02:24:12,633 --> 02:24:20,451
you are just out of range of it-- and Kima are
affected. So that would be Pike, Vex, Trinket,

2358
02:24:20,451 --> 02:24:25,116
technically. Clarota. So I need you guys to make a
constitution saving throw.

2359
02:24:25,116 --> 02:24:28,005
MARISHA: What?

2360
02:24:28,005 --> 02:24:29,959
SAM: (garbled) Make a constitution saving throw.

2361
02:24:29,959 --> 02:24:32,198
MATT: Pike? Whenever she comes back.

2362
02:24:32,198 --> 02:24:34,495
SAM: Who has to do this? Pike, Clarota?

2363
02:24:34,495 --> 02:24:36,336
MATT: Pike, Clarota, Trinket, Vex.

2364
02:24:36,336 --> 02:24:37,612
LAURA: Should I roll for Pike?

2365
02:24:37,612 --> 02:24:39,556
MATT: Wait until she gets back. What did you
roll?

2366
02:24:39,599 --> 02:24:45,596
LAURA: 19. Oh, 19 and then for Trinket-- oh no.

2367
02:24:45,596 --> 02:24:52,795
MATT: Clarota does not make it. Kima does not make
it.

2368
02:24:52,795 --> 02:24:54,656
SAM: I can roll for Pike.

2369
02:24:54,656 --> 02:24:56,216
MATT: All right, go for it.

2370
02:24:56,216 --> 02:24:57,574
LAURA: No!

2371
02:24:57,574 --> 02:25:03,928
SAM: I've got this, guys. We're connected in a
special gnome way that you have no idea how pure

2372
02:25:03,928 --> 02:25:05,808
this bond is.

2373
02:25:05,808 --> 02:25:07,982
LIAM: Here comes the one.

2374
02:25:07,982 --> 02:25:10,952
SAM: 16, plus whatever.

2375
02:25:10,952 --> 02:25:15,959
LAURA: Oh, plus her-- wait, I'm looking up her
constitution. Plus one. 17.

2376
02:25:15,959 --> 02:25:17,508
MATT: All right. Trinket rolled a...?

2377
02:25:17,508 --> 02:25:18,937
LAURA: Seven.

2378
02:25:18,937 --> 02:25:21,284
SAM: (singing) And that's the power of love!

2379
02:25:21,284 --> 02:25:22,834
LAURA: But I rolled a 19.

2380
02:25:22,834 --> 02:25:28,725
MATT: Right, as this cloud of greenish gas bursts
out from all these strange slits in its body, you

2381
02:25:28,725 --> 02:25:34,659
feel this acidic fume fill your lungs and touch
your skin. You manage to duck out of the way and

2382
02:25:34,659 --> 02:25:40,060
resist a lot of the damage, as does Pike, pulling
up her cloak in front of the way. You guys take 14

2383
02:25:40,060 --> 02:25:48,625
points of acid damage. However, Clarota and Kima
and Trinket all take 28 points of acid damage.

2384
02:25:48,625 --> 02:25:51,287
LAURA: (gasps) 28 points?!

2385
02:25:51,287 --> 02:25:52,667
MATT: Yes.

2386
02:25:52,667 --> 02:25:53,950
SAM: For Trinket?

2387
02:25:53,950 --> 02:25:54,898
MATT: Yep.

2388
02:25:54,898 --> 02:25:56,271
SAM: Is Trinket still a cat?

2389
02:25:56,271 --> 02:26:01,238
MATT: Trinket's kitten form is taken away as the
Polymorph wears off--

2390
02:26:01,238 --> 02:26:04,083
LAURA: Oh, shit. Boom!

2391
02:26:04,083 --> 02:26:06,298
MATT: (boosh) This bear bursts out from your
chest.

2392
02:26:06,298 --> 02:26:09,419
SAM: Oh, no, your shirt is ripped.

2393
02:26:09,419 --> 02:26:11,685
LAURA: All of a sudden, my bosom comes flying
out.

2394
02:26:11,685 --> 02:26:18,321
MATT: So Trinket's at full health again. Hold on,
the kitten form, I'm going to say, would have

2395
02:26:18,321 --> 02:26:24,302
about five hit points, so taking five from 28...
Trinket has taken 23 points of damage.

2396
02:26:24,302 --> 02:26:26,766
SAM: Pike, you just took 14.

2397
02:26:26,766 --> 02:26:32,685
MATT: 14 points of acid poison damage, as this
entity vented its torso into this giant fume of

2398
02:26:32,685 --> 02:26:34,416
acidic gas.

2399
02:26:34,416 --> 02:26:37,769
SAM: It would have been much more if Scanlan
hadn't been around, that's all I'm saying.

2400
02:26:37,769 --> 02:26:39,150
ASHLEY: Oh, wow. Okay.

2401
02:26:39,150 --> 02:26:45,163
MATT: At which Trinket bursts out of Vex's torso,
landing into the bones below. (growls)

2402
02:26:45,163 --> 02:26:46,377
LAURA: No, in the bones?

2403
02:26:46,377 --> 02:26:48,501
MATT: Yeah, because on the wall (fwoosh) out in
front of you.

2404
02:26:48,501 --> 02:26:51,808
TALIESIN: Now we know how many hit points it takes
to kill a kitten. That will actually be useful.

2405
02:26:51,808 --> 02:26:54,260
Five. Five hit points.

2406
02:26:54,260 --> 02:26:55,611
LAURA: Five hit points. That's good.

2407
02:26:55,611 --> 02:26:57,455
TALIESIN: Five hit points, everyone.

2408
02:26:57,455 --> 02:27:04,270
MATT: All right. It's going to finish its turn.
That brings us to Vex.

2409
02:27:04,270 --> 02:27:05,522
LAURA: That's me!

2410
02:27:05,522 --> 02:27:06,520
MATT: Yep.

2411
02:27:06,520 --> 02:27:10,170
LAURA: Is there anything-- what's nearby? Is
anything within five feet of it?

2412
02:27:10,170 --> 02:27:13,381
MATT: Oh, actually, I should see if it-- it does
resist. It is no longer blinded.

2413
02:27:13,381 --> 02:27:15,924
SAM: Oh, snap.

2414
02:27:15,924 --> 02:27:21,891
MATT: You can see the darkness fades from its eyes
and the whiteness bursts from its face. It's

2415
02:27:21,891 --> 02:27:27,010
intent now, as each eye individually darts around
and takes reference of all the points of possible

2416
02:27:27,010 --> 02:27:29,156
attack that are now before it.

2417
02:27:29,156 --> 02:27:31,834
MARISHA: Wait, its blindness wore off? Oh, poop.

2418
02:27:31,834 --> 02:27:34,159
LAURA: Is anything within five feet of it?

2419
02:27:34,159 --> 02:27:35,404
MATT: Trinket is.

2420
02:27:35,404 --> 02:27:39,235
LAURA: Trinket's going to be affected. Oh! I
command Trinket to move, then. Can he?

2421
02:27:39,235 --> 02:27:41,154
MATT: Okay. Trinket can, yeah, if you want.

2422
02:27:41,154 --> 02:27:44,250
LAURA: Can he try to climb up and get away from
it? Oh, no. He'll take a hit, won't he.

2423
02:27:44,250 --> 02:27:45,919
MATT: He will.

2424
02:27:45,919 --> 02:27:46,960
LAURA: Do it.

2425
02:27:46,960 --> 02:27:48,262
LIAM: If it hits. It could miss.

2426
02:27:48,262 --> 02:27:49,929
LAURA: Oh god, but he's so low on health.

2427
02:27:49,929 --> 02:27:52,350
ASHLEY: Where's he at?

2428
02:27:52,350 --> 02:28:01,445
LAURA: He's right next to it! Get up, Trinket,
get up on the wall. And I'm going to cast Hail of

2429
02:28:01,445 --> 02:28:03,475
Thorns on the thing.

2430
02:28:03,475 --> 02:28:05,171
MATT: What's the radius on Hail of Thorns?

2431
02:28:05,171 --> 02:28:06,190
LAURA: Five feet.

2432
02:28:06,190 --> 02:28:10,219
MATT: Five feet. Okay. Trinket is going to attempt
to get up the wall. Make an athletics check for

2433
02:28:10,219 --> 02:28:15,256
Trinket, (laughs) who's going to try and climb a
ten-foot solid stone wall, which is--

2434
02:28:15,256 --> 02:28:16,960
TALIESIN: Bears can climb trees.

2435
02:28:16,960 --> 02:28:22,822
MATT: Trees, yes. Solid, smooth stone walls?
Little more of... but--

2436
02:28:22,822 --> 02:28:24,853
LAURA: What is it, is it an acrobatics?

2437
02:28:24,853 --> 02:28:26,140
MATT: It's going to be athletics for Trinket.

2438
02:28:26,140 --> 02:28:29,419
LAURA: Athletics. I don't know what to add, but
it's 19 plus whatever. Strength?

2439
02:28:29,419 --> 02:28:30,761
MATT: 19 plus strength.

2440
02:28:30,761 --> 02:28:32,419
LAURA: 23.

2441
02:28:32,419 --> 02:28:37,235
MATT: Okay, Trinket scrambles up the side of the
wall. As it does, one of the white eyes is looking

2442
02:28:37,235 --> 02:28:44,595
around like an iguana (tchh) focuses on Trinket,
(whoosh) goes to whip toward Trinket. That is

2443
02:28:44,595 --> 02:28:47,186
going to be a 24 versus his armor class.

2444
02:28:47,186 --> 02:28:48,797
LAURA: Oh, it hits!

2445
02:28:48,797 --> 02:28:54,481
MATT: Trinket takes 17 points of damage.

2446
02:28:54,481 --> 02:28:56,010
LAURA: Oh no!

2447
02:28:56,010 --> 02:28:59,166
MATT: Plus an additional five points of acid
damage.

2448
02:28:59,166 --> 02:29:01,994
LAURA: Trinket's unconscious!

2449
02:29:01,994 --> 02:29:06,291
MATT: As Trinket climbs up the wall, (shh, groan)
and then streaks and falls back down onto the

2450
02:29:06,291 --> 02:29:08,521
bone, unconscious.

2451
02:29:08,521 --> 02:29:09,727
SAM: Bear down!

2452
02:29:09,727 --> 02:29:10,949
ASHLEY: We'll heal him!

2453
02:29:10,949 --> 02:29:14,128
LAURA: Oh, no! He's lying in the skeletons.

2454
02:29:14,128 --> 02:29:17,991
MATT: So you're now there up top. What are you
going to do? You watched Trinket fall and hit the

2455
02:29:17,991 --> 02:29:19,295
ground.

2456
02:29:19,295 --> 02:29:20,432
ASHLEY: Kill him!

2457
02:29:20,432 --> 02:29:21,673
SAM: Not Trinket.

2458
02:29:21,673 --> 02:29:23,765
LAURA: Do I get to-- can I move if I attack, or is
that it?

2459
02:29:23,765 --> 02:29:27,530
MATT: You gave Trinket your move on this turn, so
you can still attack from where you are.

2460
02:29:27,530 --> 02:29:28,817
ASHLEY: Attack him!

2461
02:29:28,817 --> 02:29:30,054
LAURA: Will somebody save Trinket?

2462
02:29:30,054 --> 02:29:31,203
MARISHA: I'll save Trinket.

2463
02:29:31,203 --> 02:29:35,188
LAURA: Okay, then I still attack him. But wait,
will I do damage to Trinket, then, still on the

2464
02:29:35,188 --> 02:29:36,753
ground, unconscious?

2465
02:29:36,753 --> 02:29:37,872
MATT: What are you doing?

2466
02:29:37,872 --> 02:29:41,673
LAURA: Well, I was going to do Hail of Thorns, but
I shouldn't because he's within five feet?

2467
02:29:41,673 --> 02:29:43,211
MATT: Within five feet.

2468
02:29:43,211 --> 02:29:44,658
LIAM: You could do a regular arrow.

2469
02:29:44,658 --> 02:29:46,590
LAURA: All right, I do a regular flaming arrow.

2470
02:29:46,590 --> 02:29:48,134
MATT: You've used your flaming arrow twice.

2471
02:29:48,134 --> 02:29:49,788
LAURA: No, I only used it once.

2472
02:29:49,788 --> 02:29:51,124
MATT: No, you used it at the top of the round,
too.

2473
02:29:51,124 --> 02:29:57,500
LAURA: Shitballs. Okay, then I'm-- I have regular
arrows. I'm going to use Bloodseeking Bow, then.

2474
02:29:57,500 --> 02:29:59,323
MATT: Okay.

2475
02:29:59,323 --> 02:30:01,672
LAURA: Oh god. I'm freaking out.

2476
02:30:01,672 --> 02:30:04,742
MATT: Make your bloodseeking strike, now, with the
fury and anger and frustration--

2477
02:30:04,742 --> 02:30:05,731
LAURA: 26.

2478
02:30:05,731 --> 02:30:06,911
MATT: Hits.

2479
02:30:06,911 --> 02:30:09,967
LAURA: Okay.

2480
02:30:09,967 --> 02:30:11,322
ASHLEY: Roll for damage.

2481
02:30:11,322 --> 02:30:22,189
LAURA: 11, plus Hunter's Mark. 15. And then the
Bloodseeking Bow does ten bleeding damage each

2482
02:30:22,189 --> 02:30:23,271
round.

2483
02:30:23,271 --> 02:30:27,435
MATT: Nice. Okay, when we get back to its turn,
it'll have ten bleeding damage on it. You have

2484
02:30:27,435 --> 02:30:28,761
your second attack, too.

2485
02:30:28,761 --> 02:30:31,666
LAURA: Okay. 24.

2486
02:30:31,666 --> 02:30:33,316
MATT: 24 hits.

2487
02:30:33,316 --> 02:30:41,296
LAURA: That's 12. 13.

2488
02:30:41,296 --> 02:30:46,958
MATT: Okay. So both arrows (zoomf zoomf) sink
down. You can see your jaw's tense and you can feel

2489
02:30:46,958 --> 02:30:51,788
the tear running down your face, but you are
intent on taking this son of a bitch down. That

2490
02:30:51,924 --> 02:30:56,172
brings us to Tiberius. Actually, at the end of
your turn, go ahead and make a death saving throw.

2491
02:30:56,172 --> 02:30:58,612
For Trinket.

2492
02:30:58,612 --> 02:30:59,828
LAURA: Oh god.

2493
02:30:59,828 --> 02:31:01,777
SAM: Death saving throw?!

2494
02:31:01,777 --> 02:31:04,865
LIAM: Three successes or three fails. That's first
fail.

2495
02:31:04,865 --> 02:31:08,372
ASHLEY: Wait, what? No. I can add a plus ten,
right?

2496
02:31:08,372 --> 02:31:09,897
MATT: To a death saving throw?

2497
02:31:09,897 --> 02:31:11,792
LAURA: Not so much.

2498
02:31:11,792 --> 02:31:17,140
MATT: It has to be attacks for you, unfortunately.
So that's one death saving throw on Trinket.

2499
02:31:17,140 --> 02:31:18,764
Tiberius, what are you doing?

2500
02:31:18,764 --> 02:31:20,667
SAM: This is a <i>grizzly</i> situation!

2501
02:31:20,667 --> 02:31:27,632
ORION: Okay. I assess the situation, and I don't
like it.

2502
02:31:27,632 --> 02:31:32,227
SAM: The end.

2503
02:31:32,227 --> 02:31:47,051
ORION: No. I cast Watery Sphere on him, and try to
capture the guy in my sphere. That is-- oh, plus

2504
02:31:47,051 --> 02:31:53,852
this! (gasps) Oh my god, I always forget it's that
number. It's 27.

2505
02:31:53,852 --> 02:31:55,942
MATT: 27? All right.

2506
02:31:55,942 --> 02:31:57,783
ORION: 18 plus nine?

2507
02:31:57,783 --> 02:31:59,611
MATT: I'm just trying to get familiar with this
one real fast, guys.

2508
02:31:59,611 --> 02:32:01,505
MARISHA: So he uses his spell attack bonus, I'm
assuming?

2509
02:32:01,505 --> 02:32:02,797
MATT: Watery Sphere, you said?

2510
02:32:02,797 --> 02:32:04,534
ORION: Yeah. I was looking that up, too.

2511
02:32:04,534 --> 02:32:12,694
MATT: Watery Sphere. Got it here. Okay. Over the
edge, and ten feet-- okay, it's not an attack roll

2512
02:32:12,694 --> 02:32:20,134
for you. It has to make a strength saving throw.
Saving throw. That is a 21. What's the DC for your

2513
02:32:20,134 --> 02:32:21,794
spell?

2514
02:32:21,794 --> 02:32:25,245
ORION: 17.

2515
02:32:25,245 --> 02:32:33,104
MATT: Okay. So yeah. The sphere appears. The
creature is ejected from the side right there. So

2516
02:32:33,104 --> 02:32:36,267
the sphere is still there, but the creature is
un-grabbed by it.

2517
02:32:36,267 --> 02:32:38,704
ORION: Does it do damage?

2518
02:32:38,704 --> 02:32:40,795
MATT: As far as I know, it just grabs.

2519
02:32:40,795 --> 02:32:44,383
ORION: Ugh. All right. That's my bad, I shouldn't
have--

2520
02:32:44,383 --> 02:32:48,477
MATT: It restrains and grabs things inside when it
has them. It works more as control than as a

2521
02:32:48,477 --> 02:32:51,206
damaging spell, but the sphere is still there.

2522
02:32:51,206 --> 02:32:56,822
ORION: Well, fine. I can still move it, yes?

2523
02:32:56,822 --> 02:32:59,404
LAURA: Can you pick Trinket up and bring him up on
the wall?

2524
02:32:59,404 --> 02:33:07,104
ORION: She's got this. I'll move it over just to
make him all soak-y in it anyway. It's not going

2525
02:33:07,104 --> 02:33:09,564
to-- I can't move him. It doesn't control him,
right?

2526
02:33:09,564 --> 02:33:14,472
MATT: No, not if he makes the save. If he fails
the save, then yes, you have them trapped in the

2527
02:33:14,472 --> 02:33:17,675
sphere, but currently basically (sploosh) pushed
his way out of it.

2528
02:33:17,675 --> 02:33:29,079
ORION: Well, fine. I don't do that. I spend-- I
don't do anything, actually. That's my turn.

2529
02:33:29,079 --> 02:33:31,881
MATT: Okay. Vax, you're up.

2530
02:33:31,881 --> 02:33:36,109
LIAM: Okay, so Clarota's right by it, so I'm going
to roll along the back of the thing and sneak

2531
02:33:36,109 --> 02:33:37,815
attack right into its back.

2532
02:33:37,815 --> 02:33:38,792
MATT: Right here?

2533
02:33:38,792 --> 02:33:47,079
LIAM: Right there. Yeah, roll around next to him,
one dagger in. That is a 29.

2534
02:33:47,079 --> 02:33:55,609
MATT: 29. Yeah, that hits. Damn.

2535
02:33:55,609 --> 02:34:10,841
LIAM: (counts quietly) Okay, that is 33, plus
sneak attack damage, so three, seven. Shit. 18,

2536
02:34:10,841 --> 02:34:19,838
20. That's 40 plus four. 44.

2537
02:34:19,838 --> 02:34:21,033
MATT: Rogues, man.

2538
02:34:21,033 --> 02:34:26,335
LIAM: 51. I want to carve his shoulder blade out
and away like a piece of turkey--

2539
02:34:26,335 --> 02:34:28,085
MATT: It's not a critical.

2540
02:34:28,085 --> 02:34:31,432
LIAM: No. Critical's the double. Oh, sorry, scale
that back to--

2541
02:34:31,432 --> 02:34:36,416
MATT: That's a lot for a non-critical. Holy shit.
(laughs)

2542
02:34:36,416 --> 02:34:41,575
LIAM: 20. It was 20 plus two, 22. 29.

2543
02:34:41,575 --> 02:34:45,537
MATT: 29 points of damage. Still nice. So as you
reach back and you angrily take the dagger and

2544
02:34:45,537 --> 02:34:50,812
drag it down, you actually find one of those seams
of its arm, and you drag it across the front as

2545
02:34:50,812 --> 02:34:54,149
the arm actually (floop) falls off on the ground
and it squirms on its own.

2546
02:34:54,149 --> 02:34:55,651
ASHLEY: What's taking this thing so long?

2547
02:34:55,651 --> 02:34:57,615
MATT: You've managed to pull one of its tentacles
off.

2548
02:34:57,615 --> 02:35:04,407
LIAM: Next dagger's out. That was a bad roll, but
I'm going to use one of my Lucks to do that again.

2549
02:35:04,459 --> 02:35:06,481
That hits. That's 27.

2550
02:35:06,481 --> 02:35:07,518
MATT: Okay.

2551
02:35:07,518 --> 02:35:11,090
LIAM: So that is seven points of damage.

2552
02:35:11,090 --> 02:35:12,243
MATT: Okay.

2553
02:35:12,243 --> 02:35:17,797
LIAM: Last dagger out. That's 26, for eight points
of damage.

2554
02:35:17,797 --> 02:35:20,040
MATT: Nice. Eight points of damage, got it.
Great!

2555
02:35:20,040 --> 02:35:21,545
ASHLEY: How is this thing not dead?!

2556
02:35:21,545 --> 02:35:24,313
MATT: Kima is going to rush around here.

2557
02:35:24,313 --> 02:35:25,837
MARISHA: Don't be stupid, Kima!

2558
02:35:25,837 --> 02:35:29,073
SAM: What is it with you and Kima?

2559
02:35:29,073 --> 02:35:30,999
MARISHA: She's been stupid, all right?

2560
02:35:30,999 --> 02:35:33,817
LAURA: What are you talking about? She's a
paladin!

2561
02:35:33,817 --> 02:35:36,725
SAM: She's fighting with us! Don't dispirit her
while we're fighting!

2562
02:35:36,725 --> 02:35:41,879
LIAM: This is really awkward for the rest of us,
just so you know. We really like her.

2563
02:35:41,879 --> 02:35:43,772
MATT: Kima's going to attack twice with her
greatsword.

2564
02:35:43,772 --> 02:35:44,822
MARISHA: I don't like her.

2565
02:35:44,822 --> 02:35:47,240
SAM: I don't like her either, but I'm not openly
hostile to her.

2566
02:35:47,240 --> 02:35:51,856
MATT: Kima goes to strike twice, but with each
blade strike, the head glimpses over, sees the

2567
02:35:51,856 --> 02:35:56,132
attack and the body bends out of the way of the
first strike. The second one, a tentacle actually

2568
02:35:56,132 --> 02:35:59,441
slaps the blade out of her hand and she has to
reach over and pick it up again off the side of

2569
02:35:59,441 --> 02:36:04,504
the ground. The blind was very effective these
past couple of rounds, but now it's back to its

2570
02:36:04,504 --> 02:36:08,026
full strength and can see, and you can see now
that it can see where everyone is, it's going to

2571
02:36:08,026 --> 02:36:14,067
be much harder to hit. Unless you're this guy and
this girl. That brings us to Clarota. Clarota

2572
02:36:14,067 --> 02:36:20,833
can't use what Clarota wants to do, unfortunately.
Instead, is going to--

2573
02:36:20,833 --> 02:36:22,571
ASHLEY: What does Clarota want to do?

2574
02:36:22,571 --> 02:36:24,250
TALIESIN: Dance.

2575
02:36:24,250 --> 02:36:26,897
ASHLEY AND LAURA: Dance!

2576
02:36:26,897 --> 02:36:32,341
MATT: You've had it used on you before. It's
called a Mind Blast that the mind flayers did

2577
02:36:32,382 --> 02:36:36,032
before in a cone attack that can stun things in
front of it. But everyone's been clustered around

2578
02:36:36,032 --> 02:36:41,093
it, so Clarota can't quite get a place that
doesn't affect somebody else. So instead he's

2579
02:36:41,093 --> 02:36:48,744
going to do a tentacle attack against it. That
is-- oh, wow! That's a 26. That hits! Takes 15

2580
02:36:48,744 --> 02:36:53,733
points of damage and is grappled by Clarota.
Clarota currently has his tentacles wrapped up

2581
02:36:53,733 --> 02:36:57,970
onto it and is trying to pull it down with a
combination of psionic energy and its tentacle

2582
02:36:57,970 --> 02:37:01,181
grab. Keyleth, you're up!

2583
02:37:01,181 --> 02:37:10,019
MARISHA: Seeing that Clarota just grappled him,
I'm like, "All right, cool. That's good." And I'm

2584
02:37:10,019 --> 02:37:17,528
going to use a Grasping Vine from the other
stalactite and grab Trinket and see if I can--

2585
02:37:17,528 --> 02:37:19,138
LAURA: Around his waist!

2586
02:37:19,138 --> 02:37:21,123
MARISHA: Okay. Around his waist.

2587
02:37:21,123 --> 02:37:23,092
MATT: All right. You use another 4th-level
Grasping Vine?

2588
02:37:23,092 --> 02:37:24,238
MARISHA: Yeah.

2589
02:37:24,238 --> 02:37:27,544
MATT: Okay. So the Grasping Vine-- from this one
here?

2590
02:37:27,544 --> 02:37:28,892
MARISHA: Nope, that one.

2591
02:37:28,892 --> 02:37:33,992
MATT: Okay. The wall is here, so it's going to
have to curl around the side, wrap around the

2592
02:37:33,992 --> 02:37:39,378
body. As it begins to pull, you can see the bones
have already begun to reach up and begun to start

2593
02:37:39,378 --> 02:37:45,020
pulling Trinket's body down. Go ahead and make the
check for that again which is...

2594
02:37:45,020 --> 02:37:46,396
MARISHA: What is it?

2595
02:37:46,396 --> 02:37:47,550
TALIESIN: Will.

2596
02:37:47,550 --> 02:37:48,638
MARISHA: Oh, will?

2597
02:37:48,638 --> 02:37:52,042
MATT: For this one I think it was to try and--
wait a sec, I'm just making sure. I think it was

2598
02:37:52,042 --> 02:37:57,332
wisdom for the-- Let me check it real fast, just
to make sure. This is starting to get down to the

2599
02:37:57,332 --> 02:38:04,950
heavy. "Creature must make dexterity saving throw
to resist pull." Yeah, so go ahead and make a

2600
02:38:04,950 --> 02:38:06,951
willpower check. Wisdom check, sorry.

2601
02:38:06,951 --> 02:38:09,627
MARISHA: 20 again.

2602
02:38:09,627 --> 02:38:16,181
MATT: The vine wraps around Trinket and begins to
pull. The bones hold tight and the body is not

2603
02:38:16,181 --> 02:38:17,447
moving from its position.

2604
02:38:17,447 --> 02:38:18,456
LAURA: No!

2605
02:38:18,456 --> 02:38:22,579
MATT: It's a standoff between the vine holding the
unconscious body of Trinket, who you can see is

2606
02:38:22,579 --> 02:38:27,359
still moving and shifting in unconsciousness. The
bones are beginning to rise up almost like this

2607
02:38:27,359 --> 02:38:33,496
slow tide to begin to wrap over the body. All
right, that brings us to Percy.

2608
02:38:33,496 --> 02:38:35,308
ASHLEY: Wait, so we don't know?

2609
02:38:35,308 --> 02:38:38,783
MATT: It's at a standoff right now.

2610
02:38:38,783 --> 02:38:40,508
MARISHA: It's a standoff. It's tug-of-war.

2611
02:38:40,508 --> 02:38:44,983
MATT: Yeah. Not sinking, but not being pulled out,
either. It's this stalemate right now between the

2612
02:38:44,983 --> 02:38:49,094
two. The vine is taut and holding Trinket level.

2613
02:38:49,094 --> 02:38:54,975
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to spend my movement to
get nice and firm, sit myself down, pull out the

2614
02:38:54,975 --> 02:38:56,229
big gun.

2615
02:38:56,229 --> 02:39:00,291
MATT: Okay. Bad News. You see it over this wall
now. The top of this stalagmite-- it's about 50

2616
02:39:00,291 --> 02:39:04,476
feet to the top. You get to the top, you pull the
Bad News out. You have a pretty clear shot down

2617
02:39:04,476 --> 02:39:06,389
towards the entity.

2618
02:39:06,389 --> 02:39:10,204
TALIESIN: Taking a sharpshooter shot. Natural 20
on the first shot.

2619
02:39:10,204 --> 02:39:13,318
(all cheer)

2620
02:39:13,318 --> 02:39:16,664
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage for this one.

2621
02:39:16,664 --> 02:39:37,176
TALIESIN: This is going to be so much fun. (counts
out loud) 42 points of damage.

2622
02:39:37,176 --> 02:39:38,267
MATT: How do you want to do this?

2623
02:39:38,267 --> 02:39:40,668
(all cheer)

2624
02:39:40,668 --> 02:39:43,690
TALIESIN: I take a bead and I want to wait until
the eye is looking right at me, and I want to take

2625
02:39:43,690 --> 02:39:45,325
it right through the eye.

2626
02:39:45,325 --> 02:39:50,143
MATT: Okay. So as the entity turns around, its
head cocked to the side, its tendrils (sucking

2627
02:39:50,143 --> 02:39:54,644
noise) flailing around it, one lifting it up. You
can see, it begins to reach up to bring a lash

2628
02:39:54,644 --> 02:39:59,345
down upon the bear that is being clasped on the
ground, its eye streaks around and catches yours.

2629
02:39:59,345 --> 02:40:05,407
You release, pull back on the trigger... (gunshot)
The impact blows you off the top of the

2630
02:40:05,407 --> 02:40:10,647
stalagmite. You fall in the air, but in that split
second, you keep your vision on as you're floating

2631
02:40:10,647 --> 02:40:14,497
back and this whole-- this moment as time slows,
not wanting to lose this moment, you see the

2632
02:40:14,497 --> 02:40:22,015
bullet (ssst) into the head. One of the eyes now
goes dark from the crimson impact. The jaw opens

2633
02:40:22,015 --> 02:40:27,514
slack (groaning), with all the teeth exposing as
the back of the head (explosion).

2634
02:40:27,514 --> 02:40:28,878
TALIESIN: (maniacal laughter)

2635
02:40:28,878 --> 02:40:35,097
MATT: Explodes. All across Vax. Who was standing
behind it, just (vrushh)

2636
02:40:35,097 --> 02:40:36,236
LIAM: I love it!

2637
02:40:36,236 --> 02:40:38,691
(all laugh)

2638
02:40:38,691 --> 02:40:44,637
MATT: The giant hole now, which is like you can
see portions of its lower jaw are still visible,

2639
02:40:44,637 --> 02:40:50,164
but the entire top of its head is gone. You can
see parts of its flesh trying to reach up and

2640
02:40:50,164 --> 02:40:55,046
re-form, and then starting falling limp as its
form begins to quiver and eventually fall apart.

2641
02:40:55,046 --> 02:40:59,857
The seams all begin to unravel and its entire body
begins to fall apart into chunks. Eventually

2642
02:40:59,857 --> 02:41:06,109
what's left is this elven torso that slinks to its
knees (boof), takes a step,takes another step, and

2643
02:41:06,109 --> 02:41:12,008
then falls onto its back, completely destroyed.
The bones begin to reach up and take its body.

2644
02:41:12,008 --> 02:41:14,890
Trinket is still currently being held aloft.

2645
02:41:14,890 --> 02:41:20,695
ORION: I see what's going on. I cast Telekinesis
(fssh) and start pulling it up.

2646
02:41:20,695 --> 02:41:23,503
MATT: Okay, make an arcana check. You have
advantage on this because the Grasping Vine is

2647
02:41:23,546 --> 02:41:25,352
also helping.

2648
02:41:25,352 --> 02:41:27,948
ORION: Oh my god. Arcana? 12.

2649
02:41:27,948 --> 02:41:31,232
MATT: 12? You (strains) you're pulling, you're
pulling, you're pulling, but unfortunately

2650
02:41:31,232 --> 02:41:35,091
whatever cursed force holds this land is keeping
the body--

2651
02:41:35,091 --> 02:41:37,814
ASHLEY: Okay, I run up and take the Mace of
Disruption, which also has the holy oil on it,

2652
02:41:37,951 --> 02:41:42,600
which fights against undead! So I take it and I go
(ffff) right underneath.

2653
02:41:42,600 --> 02:41:45,620
MATT: All right. Pike, you're on top of the wall.
You look down and see this happening with the

2654
02:41:45,620 --> 02:41:50,738
effort of both of them unable to do so. You leap
off the top of the wall, swinging the Mace of

2655
02:41:50,738 --> 02:41:55,540
Disruption down in a giant arc. You slam it into
the bones on the side of Trinket's body. As you

2656
02:41:55,540 --> 02:42:02,225
do, you see the actual stone and bones around it
cave in and shatter into dust at the sheer force

2657
02:42:02,225 --> 02:42:08,284
of your Mace of Disruption, leaving this big old
cavernous space where there once was ground. As

2658
02:42:08,284 --> 02:42:12,509
you bring it up again, you begin swinging it
around the outside of Trinket, releasing all of

2659
02:42:12,509 --> 02:42:17,280
the bone in the vicinity. As you do, you also
notice that the bone at your feet that's beginning

2660
02:42:17,280 --> 02:42:23,032
to grab onto your legs as you landed begins to
give away and slowly back away from you.

2661
02:42:23,032 --> 02:42:24,532
MARISHA: Grab onto the vine!

2662
02:42:24,532 --> 02:42:26,443
LIAM: It's scared of her.

2663
02:42:26,443 --> 02:42:28,453
ASHLEY: It's scared of me. Yeah, that's right!

2664
02:42:28,453 --> 02:42:32,382
LAURA: Get Trinket out, and I'll pull Pike up.

2665
02:42:32,382 --> 02:42:34,926
MARISHA: Okay, I pull the bear out.

2666
02:42:34,926 --> 02:42:39,984
MATT: Between the two of you guys, you manage to,
now that it's been released from the bone, as

2667
02:42:39,984 --> 02:42:46,708
Tiberius (strains) lifts up and the vine grasping,
you lift Trinket up onto the wall, and Tiberius

2668
02:42:46,708 --> 02:42:48,624
you (thud) release Trinket on the top of the
wall.

2669
02:42:48,624 --> 02:42:50,539
LAURA: I'm healing! Giving a healing potion.

2670
02:42:50,539 --> 02:42:55,855
MARISHA: Can I take my Grasping Vine and I want to
reach out and grab the elven man real quick.

2671
02:42:55,855 --> 02:43:01,218
MATT: You reach out the Grasping Vine and you lift
up the remnants of the elven man.

2672
02:43:01,218 --> 02:43:02,621
MARISHA: Yeah?

2673
02:43:02,621 --> 02:43:03,796
MATT: Yeah.

2674
02:43:03,796 --> 02:43:07,209
MARISHA: And I want to throw his remnants back
onto our dance floor.

2675
02:43:07,209 --> 02:43:13,555
MATT: Okay. Well, the dance floor-- the wall here?
So you chuck the corpse up onto the stone wall.

2676
02:43:13,555 --> 02:43:18,568
All right, so you've all gathered around, you
administer a potion. Trinket heals-- which potion

2677
02:43:18,615 --> 02:43:19,745
are you using?

2678
02:43:19,745 --> 02:43:22,704
LAURA: The minimum, because someone else can heal
him, right?

2679
02:43:22,704 --> 02:43:23,785
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2680
02:43:23,785 --> 02:43:26,897
MATT: Yeah, yeah. That'll be 2d4 + 2.

2681
02:43:30,220 --> 02:43:34,123
LAURA: Seven. He's only got seven little health
points!

2682
02:43:34,123 --> 02:43:36,409
MATT: All right, so Trinket comes to
consciousness. (bear moan)

2683
02:43:36,409 --> 02:43:37,629
LAURA: Trinket!

2684
02:43:37,629 --> 02:43:40,574
MATT: As soon as it opens up and the first thing
Trinket sees is your face, Trinket begins to lick

2685
02:43:40,574 --> 02:43:42,144
the side of your face.

2686
02:43:42,144 --> 02:43:47,855
LAURA: Oh! (sobs) Buddy! I'm crying and I'm
petting him and I say, "It's okay."

2687
02:43:47,855 --> 02:43:52,514
MATT: Kima, Clarota, and Vax. You guys are still
on the ground. You can feel the stones and bones

2688
02:43:52,514 --> 02:43:58,289
beginning to pull up against your feet. Clarota
immediately begins to lift off the ground using

2689
02:43:58,289 --> 02:44:04,386
his Levitation ability, and pulls free of the
bones, lifts there for a second. Yes?

2690
02:44:04,386 --> 02:44:09,449
ASHLEY: Can I keep propellering my Mace of
Disruption as I walk? On the ground?

2691
02:44:09,449 --> 02:44:12,499
MATT: You can. As you're walking along, you're
just (kssh) hitting bits of bone. As you are, they

2692
02:44:12,499 --> 02:44:17,299
just disintegrate and turn into dust. It's leaving
a track. A little bit of a groove in the ground as

2693
02:44:17,299 --> 02:44:18,546
you do so.

2694
02:44:18,546 --> 02:44:20,965
ASHLEY: Follow me! Follow the track!

2695
02:44:20,965 --> 02:44:25,447
MARISHA: I'm going to loot this corpse real quick.
See if I see anything with this.

2696
02:44:25,447 --> 02:44:26,866
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2697
02:44:26,866 --> 02:44:29,344
MARISHA: With this corpse. Does anyone want to
help me? Who's got better investigation?

2698
02:44:29,344 --> 02:44:30,360
TALIESIN AND SAM: Sure.

2699
02:44:30,360 --> 02:44:32,117
LAURA: I've got it, but I'm busy with Trinket.

2700
02:44:32,117 --> 02:44:33,350
MARISHA: Ugh, yeah.

2701
02:44:33,350 --> 02:44:34,393
TALIESIN: Yeah, never mind.

2702
02:44:34,393 --> 02:44:36,229
SAM: I've got it. 24.

2703
02:44:36,275 --> 02:44:39,478
MATT: 24? All right.

2704
02:44:39,478 --> 02:44:40,886
MARISHA: Scanlan!

2705
02:44:40,886 --> 02:44:48,206
MATT: You start looking at it, and the clothes
that are on it are soiled and destroyed and are

2706
02:44:48,206 --> 02:44:52,896
just ruined by whatever process it went through.
as you inspect the shoulders where the tentacles

2707
02:44:52,896 --> 02:44:57,487
are, you start seeing these strange little fleshy
nubs, and as you pull away at where the wounds

2708
02:44:57,487 --> 02:45:04,603
were taken from pulling off, you can see there are
arms inside the torso that were pushed inside to

2709
02:45:04,603 --> 02:45:05,962
attach this entity.

2710
02:45:05,962 --> 02:45:08,635
ASHLEY: Can we--

2711
02:45:08,635 --> 02:45:09,677
MATT: Can you what?

2712
02:45:09,677 --> 02:45:11,237
ASHLEY: Go ahead. Sorry.

2713
02:45:11,237 --> 02:45:13,688
MATT: You can see a couple of fingers poking out
of each side.

2714
02:45:13,688 --> 02:45:16,300
ASHLEY: Should we take the body?

2715
02:45:16,300 --> 02:45:23,429
SAM: Do we see any ligatures? Is there sewing? Or
has it been stitched together?

2716
02:45:23,429 --> 02:45:27,389
MATT: The tentacles were stitched to it, and you
can't see any actual stitches, like it's this

2717
02:45:27,389 --> 02:45:30,843
weird thing where it's actually bonded to it, but
it looks like some sort of strange--

2718
02:45:30,843 --> 02:45:33,564
ORION: I'll do an arcana check on that, and I
already got 22.

2719
02:45:33,564 --> 02:45:37,113
MATT: Okay. There is a magical essence from
somewhere in the torso, but you can't quite

2720
02:45:37,113 --> 02:45:38,862
ascertain--

2721
02:45:38,878 --> 02:45:40,432
MARISHA: From somewhere in the torso?

2722
02:45:40,432 --> 02:45:41,359
MATT: Yes.

2723
02:45:41,359 --> 02:45:42,741
LAURA: Do we recognize this elf at all?

2724
02:45:42,741 --> 02:45:48,133
MATT: (laughs) You don't recognize any of its face
because it's gone. Bad News disintegrated its

2725
02:45:48,274 --> 02:45:52,489
head. Unless you want to piece all the pieces that
are currently on Vax together and try to reform

2726
02:45:52,489 --> 02:45:56,117
the face, but from what you can tell it wasn't
anything you could recognize necessarily.

2727
02:45:56,117 --> 02:45:58,426
SAM: I'll take out my dagger and dig into his
torso.

2728
02:45:58,426 --> 02:46:02,110
MATT: As you (squishy flesh sounds) begin to pull
out bits, the rest of you guys manage to make your

2729
02:46:02,110 --> 02:46:06,704
way up to the top of this stone wall now. You're
all for the most part safe, for the time being.

2730
02:46:06,704 --> 02:46:08,778
TALIESIN: Thank you for that.

2731
02:46:08,778 --> 02:46:15,642
MATT: Sorry. You cut through the body. You start
seeing there are just layers and layers of teeth

2732
02:46:15,642 --> 02:46:21,534
growing out of all portions in the interior of it.
You find the fingers are attached to a hand, which

2733
02:46:21,534 --> 02:46:26,449
are attached to a wrist. You pull a little bit,
and with this horrible sickening (fssht) sound you

2734
02:46:26,449 --> 02:46:32,002
manage to pull an arm out from inside the torso,
covered in its own blood and fluids.

2735
02:46:32,002 --> 02:46:34,049
ORION: Prestidigitation! Clean that up.

2736
02:46:34,049 --> 02:46:37,765
MATT: You clean it off. The magical essence you
were seeing earlier actually is coming from a set

2737
02:46:37,765 --> 02:46:39,762
of metallic bracers that are on the wrists.

2738
02:46:39,762 --> 02:46:41,925
SAM: Take them! I take them.

2739
02:46:41,925 --> 02:46:43,231
MATT: Okay.

2740
02:46:43,231 --> 02:46:44,825
LAURA: Don't put them on, though. Don't put them
on.

2741
02:46:44,825 --> 02:46:47,198
ORION: I'll inspect them.

2742
02:46:47,198 --> 02:46:48,472
LIAM: They're cursed.

2743
02:46:48,472 --> 02:46:50,375
MATT: Okay. Make an arcana check.

2744
02:46:50,375 --> 02:46:52,141
ORION: Let's see. 13.

2745
02:46:52,141 --> 02:46:57,905
MATT: 13? It takes you a while, but you manage to
get an idea of what the essence of the magic is.

2746
02:46:58,044 --> 02:47:01,460
MARISHA: I think it's for you, Vex.

2747
02:47:01,460 --> 02:47:03,411
LAURA: Oh, really? Let me see it.

2748
02:47:03,411 --> 02:47:05,967
ORION: Translated, it's Bracers of Archery. You
should check it out.

2749
02:47:05,967 --> 02:47:19,492
ASHLEY: Can I cast Cure Wounds on Trinket? And I
cast him to 20. Second level. I rolled.

2750
02:47:19,492 --> 02:47:20,582
MATT: You rolled a 20 total?

2751
02:47:20,582 --> 02:47:21,487
ASHLEY: Yeah. 20 total.

2752
02:47:21,487 --> 02:47:23,441
MATT: Okay. So Trinket heals 20 more hit points.

2753
02:47:23,441 --> 02:47:24,613
LAURA: Oh, yay! Really?

2754
02:47:24,613 --> 02:47:29,384
MATT: So keep tabs on that because that will carry
over into the next session. All right. So you guys

2755
02:47:29,384 --> 02:47:34,594
are now standing aloft, on the wall. You can
barely see past, about another 120, 150 feet ahead

2756
02:47:34,594 --> 02:47:40,684
of you, the sea of bone chips and glass seems to
eventually fade into more stone.

2757
02:47:40,684 --> 02:47:42,305
MARISHA: Let's get out of here.

2758
02:47:42,305 --> 02:47:46,496
SAM: Hey, will you lead the way, Pike, with your
crazy mace path?

2759
02:47:46,496 --> 02:47:49,049
LIAM: Air guitar us out of here?

2760
02:47:49,049 --> 02:47:52,807
ASHLEY: Can I keep on? (guitar noises)

2761
02:47:52,807 --> 02:47:57,975
ORION: Actually, wait a minute. Hold on a sec. My
water sphere is still there, isn't it? I'm going

2762
02:47:57,975 --> 02:48:02,697
to take it and push it along our way as well, in
front of her who's swinging it as well.

2763
02:48:02,697 --> 02:48:04,204
MATT: Okay.

2764
02:48:04,204 --> 02:48:06,434
ORION: Push it up to 30 feet.

2765
02:48:06,434 --> 02:48:08,145
MATT: So you're pushing this behind her?

2766
02:48:08,145 --> 02:48:12,175
ORION: In front of her. Just a nice little (pssht)
like 30 feet from where we are.

2767
02:48:12,175 --> 02:48:17,421
MATT: Okay. So the sphere crests ahead as you guys
push forward. Pike, you're taking your mace of

2768
02:48:17,421 --> 02:48:21,271
disruption with your shield up and you're slamming
it before you. As it does there's just plumes of

2769
02:48:21,271 --> 02:48:26,431
dust that are being cast in the air behind you
guys. You cough a little bit as it's lifting the

2770
02:48:26,431 --> 02:48:35,199
small spray of dust. You begin to make your way
across this open field of bone and glass to the

2771
02:48:35,199 --> 02:48:41,413
other side, finding for the first time in a little
bit of time solid stone ground. You all take a

2772
02:48:41,413 --> 02:48:44,838
moment and gather your breath, and as you're
taking a moment, you look over and you can see in

2773
02:48:44,838 --> 02:48:52,127
the darkness ahead of you what looks to be a faint
source of light around another large pillar or

2774
02:48:52,309 --> 02:48:54,092
cluster of stone in the distance.

2775
02:48:54,092 --> 02:48:55,076
ASHLEY: Is it a color?

2776
02:48:55,076 --> 02:48:56,277
LAURA: Do I see any tracks around?

2777
02:48:56,277 --> 02:48:58,228
MATT: It's reddish-orange and appears to have a
flicker to it.

2778
02:48:58,228 --> 02:49:00,934
LAURA: Do I see tracks? Can I sense goliath
tracks?

2779
02:49:00,934 --> 02:49:04,824
MATT: Go ahead and roll a survival check.

2780
02:49:04,824 --> 02:49:06,758
SAM: How far away is it from us?

2781
02:49:06,758 --> 02:49:09,516
MATT: It's probably about 70, 80 feet.

2782
02:49:09,516 --> 02:49:11,045
LAURA: 25.

2783
02:49:11,045 --> 02:49:20,134
MATT: 25? You see more duergar feet patterns, and
you see those same singular tracks.

2784
02:49:20,134 --> 02:49:23,006
LIAM: And you said it's flickering, the light?

2785
02:49:23,006 --> 02:49:23,890
MATT: Yes.

2786
02:49:23,890 --> 02:49:25,605
LIAM: Probably a campfire.

2787
02:49:25,605 --> 02:49:27,024
SAM: Let's go kick some ass.

2788
02:49:27,024 --> 02:49:28,506
MARISHA: Want to go see?

2789
02:49:28,506 --> 02:49:29,677
LIAM: I'll go take a look.

2790
02:49:29,677 --> 02:49:30,928
MATT: Roll stealth.

2791
02:49:30,928 --> 02:49:32,611
MARISHA: Take a short rest there.

2792
02:49:32,611 --> 02:49:34,296
SAM: Do we need it? Is anyone hurt?

2793
02:49:34,296 --> 02:49:35,544
MARISHA: Just a short one.

2794
02:49:35,544 --> 02:49:36,427
LIAM: 25.

2795
02:49:36,427 --> 02:49:37,407
MATT: 25?

2796
02:49:37,407 --> 02:49:39,180
LIAM: Everyone rest while I go peek, because I'm
fine.

2797
02:49:39,180 --> 02:49:42,686
SAM: We don't need rest for spells, we just need
rest for health, right?

2798
02:49:42,686 --> 02:49:46,632
MARISHA: Just a short rest, yeah, so I can
recharge my animal changes.

2799
02:49:46,632 --> 02:49:47,987
ASHLEY: If we take a short rest, do we get any
spells back?

2800
02:49:47,987 --> 02:49:53,281
MATT: No spells back, unfortunately. You guys stay
back while you go ahead and stealth your way up.

2801
02:49:53,281 --> 02:49:56,418
Did you roll disadvantage on that one?

2802
02:49:56,418 --> 02:49:58,507
LIAM: Disadvantage?

2803
02:49:58,507 --> 02:49:59,768
SAM: Your foot.

2804
02:49:59,768 --> 02:50:00,881
LAURA: Because of your foot!

2805
02:50:00,881 --> 02:50:02,048
LIAM: But the cloak then cancels it out.

2806
02:50:02,048 --> 02:50:03,889
MATT: That's right, yes, so you're fine. It's a
natural roll.

2807
02:50:03,889 --> 02:50:04,838
LIAM: So 25.

2808
02:50:04,838 --> 02:50:08,564
MATT: 25, okay. So you make your way through the
darkness, around the side of the stone platform

2809
02:50:08,564 --> 02:50:13,124
and as you crest your vision, you can see the
flickering is indeed a small campfire. Not used

2810
02:50:13,124 --> 02:50:16,577
for light, but apparently used for cooking as the
scent also hits you. There is some sort of meat

2811
02:50:16,577 --> 02:50:18,339
currently being cooked on this flame.

2812
02:50:18,339 --> 02:50:19,660
LIAM: Does it smell good?

2813
02:50:19,660 --> 02:50:24,332
MATT: It smells pretty good. You're not quite sure
what the source of the meat is. You worry for a

2814
02:50:24,332 --> 02:50:27,526
second because you see the two duergar that are
sitting there, currently holding the meat in the

2815
02:50:27,526 --> 02:50:35,136
center of this, are staying next to a giant troll
who has his hand on the side of a rickety wooden

2816
02:50:35,136 --> 02:50:40,688
cart. On this cart, which you can see, there are
two sets of wheels on each side, there is a large

2817
02:50:40,688 --> 02:50:45,615
lumbering goliath individual currently held down
with bands of iron.

2818
02:50:45,615 --> 02:50:50,480
Your mind for second thinks, "Oh god, are they
eating him?" but you see he appears to be intact,

2819
02:50:50,480 --> 02:50:55,657
though with a quick glance as you peer around the
other side of the stone column, you can see his

2820
02:50:55,657 --> 02:51:00,931
body is riddled with scratches and small wounds
and incisions, and you can see where streaks of

2821
02:51:00,931 --> 02:51:02,827
dried blood are across his entire body.

2822
02:51:02,827 --> 02:51:05,977
LAURA: They're going to try to make him into one
of the stitch monsters!

2823
02:51:05,977 --> 02:51:07,059
MARISHA: Yes, they are.

2824
02:51:07,059 --> 02:51:08,274
LAURA: We're not there.

2825
02:51:08,274 --> 02:51:15,703
MATT: You also do see, across the way there are
three tents set up around this area. One of the

2826
02:51:15,703 --> 02:51:21,843
tents opens up and you see a duergar female step
out: silver circlet across her forehead, long

2827
02:51:21,843 --> 02:51:28,798
robes. Queen Ulara walks up and starts talking to
the other duergar, pointing to your goliath

2828
02:51:28,798 --> 02:51:34,023
friend, to Grog, on the front of this. Motions to
the other two and steps back into the tent,

2829
02:51:34,023 --> 02:51:38,169
closing it behind her as the two other duergar
grin. One reaches into his pouch and begins to

2830
02:51:38,169 --> 02:51:42,871
pull out small, looks like metal hooked utensils,
possibly to go in for another round of whatever

2831
02:51:42,871 --> 02:51:44,362
they'd been doing.

2832
02:51:44,362 --> 02:51:46,092
ASHLEY: I'm going to kill that bitch!

2833

LIAM: Into my earring, (whispers) Come, now.

2834

2835

LAURA: (whispers) We should go!

2836
02:51:53,158 --> 02:51:54,684
MATT: And this is where we're going to end today's
session.

2837
02:51:54,684 --> 02:51:58,567
(all groan)

2838
02:52:00,462 --> 02:52:11,612
SAM: Wow. That was exciting, and I feel empowering
to a lot of the female--
