1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,957
MATT: Good evening, everyone! And welcome to our
eleventh episode of Critical Role. I think our

2
00:00:04,957 --> 00:00:09,557
story is definitely brewing towards a coming
conclusion, whether this week or some point soon.

3
00:00:09,557 --> 00:00:13,870
We'll see how the story pans out. Nevertheless,
the excitement's definitely growing for Vox

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,620
Machina. We're currently waiting for a couple of
the party members to arrive here. But they'll be

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,271
here very shortly. But in the meantime, let's go
ahead and jump to our intro, and we'll come back

6
00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:27,216
and have a few announcements before we hop into
this week's episode and see where the story goes.

7
00:00:27,216 --> 00:00:29,482
See you in just a minute.

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:01:34,319
[dramatic music]

9
00:01:36,364 --> 00:01:41,609
MATT: Hello everyone! Welcome back! (laughs)
Today's been a chaotic, end-of-the-week

10
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:43,217
bit of insanity.

11
00:01:43,217 --> 00:01:45,791
ZAC: They can't see everyone running to get the
donuts.

12
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:48,554
MATT: Yeah, they can't see you guys running to get
your donuts, so it's fine. Our party was just

13
00:01:48,554 --> 00:01:50,220
scattering to the four winds.

14
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,958
MARISHA: Oh, is the visual still on Matt?

15
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:53,262
MATT: It's on me. It's fine, guys.

16
00:01:53,262 --> 00:01:54,248
MARISHA: Aww, damn it!

17
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:59,175
MATT: That's all right. So, anyway, guys. Welcome
back. We have a few announcements. First off,

18
00:01:59,175 --> 00:02:05,515
thank you once again, chat, for giving me this
awesome, awesome DM's cloak. We'll see at which

19
00:02:05,515 --> 00:02:08,262
point in the evening it becomes perfunctory. Also,
apparently we had a load of other

20
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:10,052
gifts that arrived.

21
00:02:10,052 --> 00:02:15,040
ZAC: Yeah, yeah. Let's come over to this, so-- The
chatroom knew you guys had a big battle today,

22
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,634
possibly. So they wanted to help you guys out. So,
Marisha.

23
00:02:21,634 --> 00:02:25,040
(cheering)

24
00:02:25,281 --> 00:02:26,295
MATT: That's great!

25
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:27,276
MARISHA: Yes!

26
00:02:27,276 --> 00:02:29,366
ZAC: And this is for you, Ashley.

27
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:32,947
ASHLEY: What? A mace? Yes!

28
00:02:32,947 --> 00:02:37,024
ZAC: I'm not sure who the elf ears are for, that's
probably one of you guys. Actually, you know what?

29
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:40,379
I think these are for-- We have the bear, Trinket,
and the ears.

30
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,036
LAURA: Oh, goodness gracious!

31
00:02:43,036 --> 00:02:44,626
MARISHA: You got a Trinket?

32
00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:46,416
ZAC: I'll let you open that--

33
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,556
LAURA: Oh my god you guys, he's a puppet!

34
00:02:49,556 --> 00:02:52,312
MARISHA: Oh my god! Shut. Up.

35
00:02:52,312 --> 00:02:54,642
ZAC: I'm not sure what that's for--

36
00:02:54,642 --> 00:03:03,033
MATT: This has to be for the dragonborn. I think,
Orion, that this is a skull of a dragonborn. To

37
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:06,006
put your material components in. Open it up.

38
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:08,145
ORION: Oh shit!

39
00:03:08,145 --> 00:03:09,648
MARISHA: That's so cool!

40
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:13,715
ZAC: I'm pretty sure we have a thing-- a gun on
the way, or something? Someone messaged us.

41
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:15,243
I'm like--

42
00:03:15,243 --> 00:03:16,751
MATT: (laughs) They just ship him a glock.

43
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:18,919
(laughter)

44
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,904
ASHLEY: Who provided these?

45
00:03:20,904 --> 00:03:24,661
ZAC: I'll have to look that up. We had so much
stuff. I'll look it up.

46
00:03:24,661 --> 00:03:26,361
MATT: Please look it up. We want to thank you
before the end of the show.

47
00:03:26,361 --> 00:03:30,358
ZAC: This is for Scanlan, he's on his way. And
then we have-- Oh, we have the little mouse here.

48
00:03:30,358 --> 00:03:32,382
TALIESIN: Yeah, I gotta see that flute, though.

49
00:03:32,382 --> 00:03:36,553
ZAC: I believe this is for Grog. If I'm getting
any of these wrong, the chatroom will yell at me

50
00:03:36,553 --> 00:03:37,632
and we'll figure it out.

51
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:38,754
MATT: Yeah, please figure it out.

52
00:03:38,754 --> 00:03:40,345
ZAC: But obviously we know who this is for.

53
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,805
MATT: Yeah, we'll pass that over to his side,
there.

54
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:47,573
ZAC: The only other announcement I have, guys,
thank you all so much for helping us reach the

55
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:48,548
shirt goal.

56
00:03:48,548 --> 00:03:49,535
MATT: Yes, thank you so much.

57
00:03:49,535 --> 00:03:50,528
ASHLEY: Yes, thank you!

58
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:53,631
ZAC: You have a couple more hours to get the
shirts if you don't have them yet. But we're not

59
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:57,198
going to push it on you guys, we already reached
the goal. So thank you all so much. But if you

60
00:03:57,198 --> 00:04:02,288
still want one, I think you have, like, four more
hours and then they're gone and that shirt is no

61
00:04:02,288 --> 00:04:03,398
longer available.

62
00:04:03,398 --> 00:04:04,731
MATT: It's done after this.

63
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:05,742
ZAC: Done!

64
00:04:05,742 --> 00:04:08,515
ORION: It's this, but gray.

65
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:14,359
ZAC: Ryan, can you hand me those pictures that I
had sitting there? Where'd those go? Our giveaway

66
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:22,640
tonight is when we get to 2,950 subs, we're going
to give away a 5th Edition Player's Handbook,

67
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:30,030
signed. As well as a signed photo of the Critical
Role crew, here. So every 50 subs we'll give away

68
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:35,267
this with a 5th Edition signed Player's Handbook.
And that's pretty much it. That's all I got.

69
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:36,159
MATT: Yeah.

70
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,135
ZAC: Good luck! I hope you guys die.

71
00:04:38,135 --> 00:04:39,820
ASHLEY: No! Get outta here!

72
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:45,868
MATT: Oh, there we go! And also, for Percy--

73
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,300
MARISHA: Yes!

74
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:54,906
MATT: (laughs) For Percy, you get your own.
Plastic on there. Pass that on over.

75
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:56,253
TALIESIN: No one is safe.

76
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:57,783
MATT: Oh, that's amazing.

77
00:04:57,783 --> 00:04:59,713
ORION: Thank you so much. Who's the name of the
guy?

78
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:04,686
MATT: We're finding out. We'll definitely thank
you before the end of today. Also, want to give a

79
00:05:04,686 --> 00:05:09,084
thanks out to John Dodson, who is the first to
create and send off--

80
00:05:09,084 --> 00:05:10,208
ORION: Our magic carpet?

81
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,598
MATT: Our magic carpet for the party to use.

82
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:12,907
(cheering)

83
00:05:12,907 --> 00:05:14,506
LAURA: Oh, and it's up on a thing!

84
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:17,210
MATT: Yep. I understand we're going to have quite
a few magic carpets coming in. So we're probably

85
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,255
going to be swapping out as it's used, as the game
progresses.

86
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,280
MARISHA: It's going to be, "The Magic Carpet of A
Different Color".

87
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,747
MATT: Exactly! So it's going to be "The Amazing
Technicolor Magic Carpet."

88
00:05:26,747 --> 00:05:29,498
LAURA: Matt, who sent these to us for our
birthday?

89
00:05:29,498 --> 00:05:31,672
ORION: Matt Aberny, I believe?

90
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:33,441
MATT: That's awesome.

91
00:05:33,441 --> 00:05:38,136
ORION: Yes, Aberny. If we're saying your name
wrong, I will say it right next week. I'm sorry.

92
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:39,615
But you're awesome.

93
00:05:39,615 --> 00:05:42,227
MATT: Matt Abernathy, I think it is.

94
00:05:42,227 --> 00:05:43,261
LAURA and ORION: Abernathy?

95
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:46,524
MATT: I think. If we're butchering it, I
apologize, but we love you.

96
00:05:46,524 --> 00:05:48,329
ORION: You know who you are. Thank you. They're
awesome.

97
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:56,267
MARISHA: Also, I had one of the first run of these
Critical Role shirts returned to me. I'm not sure

98
00:05:56,267 --> 00:06:01,342
who, someone from Canada. So if you could e-mail
me and give me your right address.

99
00:06:01,342 --> 00:06:04,448
MATT: Yeah, we'll research that and figure out who
it was. We'll get it to you.

100
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,886
MARISHA: I'm not sure who it was. But I had one
returned.

101
00:06:06,886 --> 00:06:09,796
MATT: Yeah, if you're from Canada and you haven't
received your shirt yet, go ahead and email one of

102
00:06:09,796 --> 00:06:14,524
us and we'll figure out if it's you or not. So,
we'll get it to you one way or another. A couple

103
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:19,162
other quick announcements for you folks. Let's
see. First off, I just want to remind everyone

104
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:24,562
that our intro music, for our wonderful intro you
just saw, written by the amazing Jason Charles

105
00:06:24,562 --> 00:06:29,122
Miller, is on iTunes. So if you want that as a
ringtone, or just to have the music, you're

106
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:32,057
welcome to go ahead and find it on iTunes,
download it. It all goes to him because he's

107
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:33,781
amazing and he did it for us for free.

108
00:06:33,781 --> 00:06:35,283
ORION: Yeah, and it rocks.

109
00:06:35,283 --> 00:06:40,554
MATT: It's a great song. It gets me pumped. Also,
other questions come up recently asking what our

110
00:06:40,554 --> 00:06:44,918
soundtracks are for the show, that I play for
situations. The music that I run for the show for

111
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:46,048
background and situations--

112
00:06:46,048 --> 00:06:48,388
LAURA: Zac! Travis is outside.

113
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:51,572
MATT: Go let Travis in. We have a Grog arriving.
And Scanlan shortly.

114
00:06:51,572 --> 00:06:52,953
LIAM: Scanlan's in traffic.

115
00:06:52,953 --> 00:06:56,664
MATT: Yeah, but he'll be here soon. The
soundtracks used for the game generally stem from

116
00:06:56,664 --> 00:07:04,221
a website called Incompetech by Kevin MacLeod, who
writes great, royalty-free music. He's given us

117
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:10,339
permission to use it. As well as Plate Mail Games,
which does great soundtrack and atmospheric music

118
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:16,342
for RPGs. And Midnight Syndicate, also amazing,
amazing songs. They've all been amazing. So if you

119
00:07:16,342 --> 00:07:21,271
guys are looking for stuff for your own games,
those are where I find mine. Also, I wanted to

120
00:07:21,271 --> 00:07:26,205
give a big thanks to our wonderful artist, Kit
Buss, who's done all the character art.

121
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:28,215
ORION: Kit, we love you.

122
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:29,248
MARISHA: Kit's awesome.

123
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,049
ASHLEY: Love you.

124
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,310
ORION: She's so good.

125
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,785
MATT: She's been incredible and is progressing to
do more work for us down the road of little

126
00:07:33,785 --> 00:07:36,465
moments throughout the game that we'll be able to
find ways to show you guys, and it's just

127
00:07:36,465 --> 00:07:42,491
incredible stuff. So Kit, thank you so much.
You're amazing. And we'll have more to come. Last,

128
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:45,914
but not least, 826LA, our charity. Marisha, do you
want to--

129
00:07:45,914 --> 00:07:55,384
MARISHA: Yes. 826LA is an after-school tutoring
program and they feature in creative writing, and

130
00:07:55,384 --> 00:08:00,347
storytelling, and they have a Young Authors'
program, which is super amazing. And they also

131
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:06,080
tend to have really cool storefronts. There's one
here, locally, in Los Angeles, one in Echo Park,

132
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:12,103
and one in Mar Vista. But there tend to be 826s in
major cities all across the country. So you should

133
00:08:12,103 --> 00:08:17,643
check it out, and go to their storefronts and
tutor the kids and get involved. They're a really

134
00:08:17,643 --> 00:08:19,276
good program.

135
00:08:19,276 --> 00:08:29,130
MATT: So, thank you so much, Marisha. Guys, check
that out. Grog, the chatroom bought you another

136
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,249
chalice to drink. You now have many things to
drink your grog from.

137
00:08:33,249 --> 00:08:35,195
LAURA: Ooh, that's some fancy grog happening.

138
00:08:35,195 --> 00:08:36,345
MATT: That's a fancy cup!

139
00:08:36,345 --> 00:08:37,228
TRAVIS: Woohoo!

140
00:08:37,228 --> 00:08:38,409
MARISHA: We all got things.

141
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:39,568
LAURA: We all got presents, Grog!

142
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:40,627
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

143
00:08:40,627 --> 00:08:41,756
ORION: Grog!

144
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:45,411
TRAVIS: You got a gun, you got a staff, You've
got-- Is that a skull of your, like,

145
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:46,683
younger brother?

146
00:08:46,683 --> 00:08:48,562
ORION: It's of my ancestor.

147
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:49,858
ASHLEY: Oh, is that a dice holder?

148
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:52,679
TRAVIS: Oh, nice! That's not dark, at all.
(mutters) What the fuck?

149
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,234
(laughter)

150
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:57,677
TRAVIS: Dagger, bear, mace! I need to put
something in this.

151
00:08:57,677 --> 00:09:03,722
MATT: A couple other things before we start the
game. Thank you for your patience, guys. We have

152
00:09:03,722 --> 00:09:08,431
one present here from a Joe Alfano. Whatever it
is, I haven't opened it up yet. We'll see what

153
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:09,665
this is here shortly.

154
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:11,729
MARISHA: Ooh! Seekwet pwesent!

155
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:14,585
MATT: We'll find out. A present, a letter, or
something really cool.

156
00:09:14,585 --> 00:09:18,352
ZAC: We're only six subs away from our first
giveaway.

157
00:09:18,352 --> 00:09:19,208
LAURA: Oh, wow!

158
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:24,191
MATT: Oh, snap! "Matt, a three-by-two flying
carpet, sized for six medium-sized figures,

159
00:09:24,191 --> 00:09:27,144
"depending on your bases. There may be some
overhangs. This is one of two, the embroidery

160
00:09:27,144 --> 00:09:28,445
"takes some time."

161
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:29,983
LAURA: Another one?

162
00:09:29,983 --> 00:09:32,964
MATT: "The first time, if not every time, Scanlan
rides the carpet with someone else, especially

163
00:09:32,964 --> 00:09:38,424
"with Pike, he has to sing 'A Whole New World' from
Aladdin. Enjoy, Zombie Joe." That's amazing.

164
00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:41,431
(cheering)

165
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:42,640
MATT: So we now have--

166
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,962
LAURA: A new carpet!

167
00:09:43,962 --> 00:09:47,359
MATT: Two carpets. A layered, Amazing Technicolor
Magic Carpet.

168
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:48,419
MARISHA: Woo!

169
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:53,783
MATT: Thank you so much, Zombie Joe. And then we
have a great letter that is-- I'll probably read

170
00:09:53,783 --> 00:09:58,648
it at the end of the show today from Useless
Rogue, or Scott Ropner. So we're going to jump in

171
00:09:58,648 --> 00:10:02,049
the game and this is an amazing letter I'm going
to go ahead and read later on when we have a

172
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:06,790
little more time. So we'll get to that shortly.
All right, so I think that gets us up to speed on

173
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:13,040
everything we're trying to get you guys up to
speed on before the show. So, welcome to Critical

174
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,821
Role. To give you guys a little backstory as to
where we are, for those who are tuning in for the

175
00:10:18,821 --> 00:10:23,869
first time, oh, you are tuning in to an
interesting time. This party of adventurers were

176
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:32,009
tasked to locate an individual, a famed folk hero,
a paladin of Bahamut named Lady Kima of Vord, who,

177
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:37,192
on a vision quest, went to search out and destroy
a great evil that was germinating beneath the

178
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:42,182
dwarven city of Kraghammer in the Cliffkeep
Mountains. The party, upon delving beneath the

179
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:47,892
city, discovered it breached into the Underdark,
and, following her trail, fought past duergar,

180
00:10:47,892 --> 00:10:54,741
ashy-skinned evil dwarves, past mind flayers and
various other terrifying denizens of the

181
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:59,861
Underdark, eventually saving Lady Kima after weeks
of her own torture, and discovering that some

182
00:10:59,861 --> 00:11:07,769
great evil named K'Varn had unified these normal
enemy races, the duergar and the mind flayers, the

183
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:16,529
illithid. Also finding that apparently, this
individual-- Yes, sir?

184
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:20,282
ZAC: We should probably just go ahead and do the
giveaway, 'cause we already got to six.

185
00:11:20,282 --> 00:11:24,426
MATT: Oh! Well, snap! Let me finish explaining
this and we'll do the giveaway. They discovered

186
00:11:24,426 --> 00:11:27,647
this entity called K'Varn, this great and powerful
entity, which, apparently, had acquired an

187
00:11:27,647 --> 00:11:33,750
artifact known as the Horn of Orcus, that adorns
its head that gives it some sort of power imbued

188
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:39,778
by the dark god of undeath, Orcus himself. The
party then managed to find its way into a cavern

189
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:45,610
where the illithid city, Yug'Voril, exists. And
after a Scry spell via Keyleth last episode,

190
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:52,413
unveiled this entity K'Varn to be a dastardly
beholder, an extremely dangerous aberration that

191
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:58,249
currently holds, at the top of the temple in the
city, a stranglehold on the mind flayer

192
00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:04,134
civilization. So, that was where we left off, the
party slowly encroaching the edge of this island.

193
00:12:04,134 --> 00:12:08,908
And we'll start in a moment once you give the
giveaway.

194
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:11,842
ZAC: All you gotta do is let them know to be
active in the chatroom, and that makes them a part

195
00:12:11,842 --> 00:12:12,862
of the giveaway.

196
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:15,383
MATT: All right, guys, so be active in the
chatroom, that will enter you as part of the

197
00:12:15,383 --> 00:12:19,318
giveaway. We've already hit that, so the giveaway
should be happening very soon. So, say "hello",

198
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:21,543
say your opinion, be around, and have fun.

199
00:12:21,543 --> 00:12:22,870
LAURA: Say, "Vex is awesome."

200
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,907
MATT: That's right.

201
00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:25,129
LAURA: Say you love Trinket.

202
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:29,235
MATT: Well, so, it's a shame Scanlan is not here
at the moment, since--

203
00:12:29,235 --> 00:12:30,907
LIAM: He's stuck, he's really stuck.

204
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:32,079
MARISHA: He's stuck on the 5.

205
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,715
TRAVIS: What's the fleshy thing in front of you?

206
00:12:33,715 --> 00:12:34,671
LAURA: That's ears.

207
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,006
LIAM: These are dried apricots.

208
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,194
TRAVIS: Those are huge!

209
00:12:37,194 --> 00:12:41,706
MATT: I'm just saying it's a shame, because he's
right in the thick of this sequence here. So, as

210
00:12:41,706 --> 00:12:46,893
the party was making their way up the shore, they
found bits of the ruins that coat the entirety of

211
00:12:46,893 --> 00:12:50,997
the subterranean city. They found what looked like
some sort of a large stone, partially crumbled

212
00:12:50,997 --> 00:12:56,592
fighting pit. And what looked-- As Vex, Vax, and
Scanlan were stealthing over, Scanlan himself

213
00:12:56,592 --> 00:13:04,119
invisible, had stealthed over to scout ahead,
managed to find what looked like an encampment of

214
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:13,532
some kind. A series of rags and furs. A very large
living space for some sort of creature. Scanlan,

215
00:13:13,532 --> 00:13:19,085
failing his stealth roll, seemed to draw the
attention of whatever entity lived there, which

216
00:13:19,085 --> 00:13:27,849
was an extremely tall, large, giant-like creature,
malformed, kind of pale purplish-gray skin, one

217
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:32,319
squinty eye and one bulging, yellowish one, that
was dragging something fleshy and bloody behind

218
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:39,510
it. It turned towards the rest of the party, going
to inspect what, seemingly, created the sound near

219
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,423
its homestead. And that is where we left off.

220
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:44,695
LIAM: What's the landscape, topography,
everything?

221
00:13:44,695 --> 00:13:49,098
MATT: Right now, you're on the outskirts of the
fungal forest that covers large portions of this

222
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:55,106
island. Where you are right now is on the edge of
this stony pit that's dug into the ground. It's

223
00:13:55,106 --> 00:14:00,265
about a 15-foot drop down into this pit, where the
remnants of this encampment was, and the leftover

224
00:14:00,265 --> 00:14:03,614
large fire pit that's just slowly burning ember
coals.

225
00:14:03,614 --> 00:14:05,324
LAURA: And Scanlan is still invisible?

226
00:14:05,324 --> 00:14:07,130
MATT: Scanlan is still invisible next to you
guys.

227
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,636
TALIESIN: Scanlan also just texted to say, "Don't
kill the giant, don't kill the giant!"

228
00:14:10,636 --> 00:14:11,941
LAURA: Right, okay.

229
00:14:11,941 --> 00:14:14,184
TALIESIN: Texted while driving, I might add. Don't
do that.

230
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:15,287
MATT: Don't do that.

231
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:16,635
TRAVIS: He wants a sex puppet.

232
00:14:16,635 --> 00:14:20,191
LAURA: Maybe Scanlan can just stay perfectly
still, and you and I can just hide

233
00:14:20,191 --> 00:14:21,599
so that Scanlan can--

234
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:24,775
LIAM: That's true, were there-- You said there
were buildings around?

235
00:14:24,775 --> 00:14:30,351
MATT: There are chunks of ruined buildings in the
vicinity, probably a good 30, 40 feet from where

236
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:32,278
you are. You guys are right along the edge.

237
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:39,026
LAURA: I think we should duck and hide under his
covers. His big, nasty fur bed.

238
00:14:39,026 --> 00:14:40,174
LIAM: All right.

239
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:41,358
MATT: (booming footsteps)

240
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:42,500
LAURA: I go!

241
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,493
LIAM: Okay, stealthing away.

242
00:14:43,493 --> 00:14:46,953
MATT: Okay, so the two of you leap off the edge of
this, down into his living, bedding area.

243
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,717
LAURA: Should I grab Scanlan and pull him in?

244
00:14:48,717 --> 00:14:50,094
LIAM: No.

245
00:14:50,094 --> 00:14:55,355
MATT: The two of you leap off, down. Both make an
acrobatics check.

246
00:14:55,355 --> 00:14:56,584
LAURA: Ugh.

247
00:14:56,584 --> 00:14:59,484
TRAVIS: Come on, guys.

248
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:10,963
LAURA: Oh, god! Oh, it's the Underdark! Ugh! I'm
switching dice. Okay, that's much better.

249
00:15:10,963 --> 00:15:14,623
MATT: Favored terrain makes a ranger very happy.

250
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,007
LAURA: That was horrifying.

251
00:15:16,007 --> 00:15:17,634
TRAVIS: She has so many dice now, it's ridiculous

252
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:18,989
LAURA: That's a 22.

253
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:19,949
MARISHA: Underdark.

254
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:21,137
MATT: 22?

255
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:21,968
LIAM: 20.

256
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:25,353
MATT: 20 and 22. All right. The two of you leap
off-- The 15-foot fall is easy to tumble through

257
00:15:25,353 --> 00:15:30,412
and both of you land right next to this large pile
of rags and furs. You both quickly dive inside.

258
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:31,472
LAURA: This is stupid.

259
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:38,338
MATT: Which, the instinct of survival prevents you
from immediately realizing the terrible, terrible

260
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:45,579
scent of long-festering body odor, what smells
like a combination of dried blood and some sort of

261
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:51,051
excrement, as well as whatever entities once wore
these furs or adorned them on their fleshy self.

262
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:55,934
There are still chunks and pieces of them, dried
and/or still rotting within this pile.

263
00:15:55,934 --> 00:15:58,186
LIAM: (retches)

264
00:15:58,186 --> 00:16:01,997
MATT: So, both of you sit there for a second,
diving underneath, keeping as quiet as possible.

265
00:16:01,997 --> 00:16:04,695
Scanlan is going to attempt to make a stealth
check.

266
00:16:04,695 --> 00:16:06,190
TRAVIS: Come on, buddy.

267
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,054
MATT: All right.

268
00:16:07,054 --> 00:16:08,240
LAURA: Oh no.

269
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,809
MATT AND ASHLEY: All right.

270
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:18,140
MATT: As this giant, humanoid beast starts
lumbering forward, and you can just barely catch a

271
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,862
glimpse at him because you guys are hiding from
behind. You can see giant, saggy, fleshy ears,

272
00:16:21,862 --> 00:16:27,394
this kind of bulbous nose. It looks almost like
tumors all across his shoulders and back. And his

273
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:32,241
teeth are kind of broken and nasty, there's this
black in the gums. It just kind of steps and looks

274
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:46,334
over the edge (sniffs and grunts). Licks his teeth
for a moment. Looks over. Takes a couple steps

275
00:16:46,334 --> 00:16:54,283
around the edge. Glances over towards the edge of
the forest. Both of you make a

276
00:16:54,283 --> 00:16:56,527
constitution saving throw.

277
00:16:56,527 --> 00:16:57,608
TRAVIS: Constitution?

278
00:16:57,608 --> 00:16:58,911
LAURA: Against his nasty-ass scent?

279
00:16:58,911 --> 00:17:01,871
MATT: As the smell, itself, it is a terrifying,
awful smell.

280
00:17:01,871 --> 00:17:05,365
TRAVIS: Or amazing, depending on who you are.

281
00:17:05,365 --> 00:17:07,131
MATT: A natural one. Top of the game.

282
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:08,192
LAURA: Oh no!

283
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:09,199
TALIESIN: Get it out now.

284
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,014
MATT: Natural one gets no bonus. That is an
automatic fail.

285
00:17:13,014 --> 00:17:16,766
LIAM: I should have rolled the one made out of
meteorite, but I used the jade one.

286
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:17,671
LAURA: Why?

287
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:18,780
LIAM: And it all went wrong.

288
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,465
MATT: What kind of a choice is that?

289
00:17:20,465 --> 00:17:22,543
TRAVIS: Fucked up, yeah. Meteorite wins
everything.

290
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:24,235
ORION: Different energies, man!

291
00:17:24,235 --> 00:17:25,357
MATT: True.

292
00:17:25,357 --> 00:17:29,340
TALIESIN: If Scanlan were here, he'd say, "We need
to capture the giant," by the way.

293
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,574
ASHLEY: He would, he would.

294
00:17:30,574 --> 00:17:31,994
LAURA: Okay, 18.

295
00:17:31,994 --> 00:17:35,096
LIAM: And I'm saying (retches).

296
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,771
LAURA: Shh! Shh! Shut up!

297
00:17:36,771 --> 00:17:41,701
MATT: So Vex, as you reach over, you notice you
put your hand up to shut him up, but an

298
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:48,747
unfamiliar, liquidy warm sensation hits your hand
as you catch him mid-vomit stream.

299
00:17:48,747 --> 00:17:50,639
(laughter)

300
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:51,748
ASHLEY: Oh, what?

301
00:17:51,748 --> 00:17:53,026
MATT: You manage to muffle some of the sound.

302
00:17:53,026 --> 00:17:54,257
TRAVIS: You chunked!

303
00:17:54,257 --> 00:17:56,268
ASHLEY: That's disgusting!

304
00:17:56,268 --> 00:17:58,085
MATT: This is really disgusting. I'm sorry, guys.

305
00:17:58,085 --> 00:18:03,746
LIAM: Good plan (vomiting noise).

306
00:18:03,746 --> 00:18:13,550
MATT: All right. The creature suddenly whips its
head over towards the pile of rags and goes

307
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:24,175
(grunts and sniffs). "What's that smell?" Grabs
the edge and leaps off. The impact of its weight

308
00:18:24,175 --> 00:18:29,521
no more than ten feet from you. You feel, even
through the softness, it is still soft through the

309
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:33,792
nastiness, you feel the impact of both of its
giant, thick, tree-like legs slam into the stone

310
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:35,359
right around you.

311
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:39,497
LAURA: Make some noise!

312
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:42,027
ORION: What do you mean? What do you want me to
do?

313
00:18:42,027 --> 00:18:45,629
MATT: Scanlan sees this.

314
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:47,400
MARISHA: (Michael Jackson voice) That's ignorant.

315
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,708
(laughter)

316
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:53,232
MATT: Hears this, and instinctively without much
recourse, his invisibility fades as he begins to

317
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,148
form an incantation.

318
00:18:55,148 --> 00:18:56,330
LAURA: Oh god.

319
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:02,364
MATT: Thankfully, he's distracted at the moment,
but the large entity is going to attempt--

320
00:19:02,364 --> 00:19:04,112
LIAM: So helpful if he was here.

321
00:19:04,112 --> 00:19:05,392
LAURA: I know, I just wish--

322
00:19:05,392 --> 00:19:07,272
LIAM: I know he's got a great plan, on the 5.

323
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:08,636
MATT: I'm sure he does.

324
00:19:08,636 --> 00:19:10,469
TALIESIN: Not texting it to us.

325
00:19:10,469 --> 00:19:14,322
MATT: See if he sent something to me. Yeah, he
texted me the same stuff, all right!

326
00:19:14,322 --> 00:19:17,323
ORION: Guys, I'm just gonna sing a song right
now.

327
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:21,891
MATT: So, no. What he's actually going to do is,
he's going to cast Domination.

328
00:19:21,891 --> 00:19:25,169
MARISHA: That's cool!

329
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:27,125
LIAM: That is what he would want to do.

330
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,312
TALIESIN: That's what he would want if he were
here.

331
00:19:30,312 --> 00:19:34,864
MATT: So, as he finishes the spell, the giant
creature, as he starts reaching and pulling the

332
00:19:34,864 --> 00:19:40,450
sheets back, it pulls back right as you guys see
its horrible, gnarled face right in front of you.

333
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:44,799
Its nose, you can see, dripping with liquid from
somewhere inside. As you pull back your blade, all

334
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:50,269
of a sudden it stops, and looks up, turns around,
looking over at Scanlan on the edge. And Scanlan

335
00:19:50,269 --> 00:20:00,646
goes, "Hey, go for a walk." And the giant, "Okay."
Climbs up to where Scanlan is, and just starts

336
00:20:00,646 --> 00:20:03,609
walking towards the fungal forest at the edge of
the area.

337
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:04,604
TRAVIS: What?!

338
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:07,478
LAURA: Maybe call him back here and we can tie him
up. Is that dumb?

339
00:20:07,478 --> 00:20:11,921
MATT: "I don't know! Come back!" Scanlan says,
"Come back." The giant turns around.

340
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:14,868
LAURA: Make him sit down.

341
00:20:14,868 --> 00:20:23,188
MATT: "Sit down!" It sits down. Still hasn't made
its saving throw.

342
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,507
LAURA: Oh, okay.

343
00:20:24,507 --> 00:20:27,200
MATT: Even sitting, Scanlan is up to its knee.

344
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,018
LAURA: Wow.

345
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:32,122
MATT: You've seen giants, to an extent, at some
point, or larger creatures. An ogre would be about

346
00:20:32,122 --> 00:20:34,547
waist-high to this.

347
00:20:34,547 --> 00:20:35,721
LAURA: Can he talk?

348
00:20:35,721 --> 00:20:38,858
MATT: For just reference, there. That's about the
size you're looking at.

349
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:40,473
LAURA: Oh! So he's really small.

350
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:41,852
MATT: He's a tiny guy, tiny guy.

351
00:20:41,852 --> 00:20:43,438
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's like Rudy.

352
00:20:43,438 --> 00:20:45,092
LAURA: Should we capture him, or should we just--

353
00:20:45,092 --> 00:20:47,591
MATT: Scanlan goes, "You, wha--"

354
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:48,865
TALIESIN: Capture him, capture him!

355
00:20:48,865 --> 00:20:50,555
MATT: "You told me to do something!" You guys
aren't there!

356
00:20:50,555 --> 00:20:51,870
LAURA: I don't think you know how big he is--

357
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,403
TALIESIN: Scanlan would say, "Capture him!"

358
00:20:53,403 --> 00:20:54,872
MATT: I know, that's what we're working through.

359
00:20:54,872 --> 00:20:58,925
LIAM: Vax just backs back into the shadows, hoping
the giant forgets about him.

360
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,042
LAURA: Thanks, vomit-y brother.

361
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:02,672
MATT: Stealth check.

362
00:21:02,672 --> 00:21:04,771
ASHLEY: But what if we have him help us fight?

363
00:21:04,771 --> 00:21:06,104
LIAM: 27.

364
00:21:06,104 --> 00:21:14,778
LAURA: Can I bust out my rope of infinite twine
and start tying it around him? Just, a lot? A lot!

365
00:21:14,778 --> 00:21:18,607
Just a whole bunch. As much as possible. Because
it's infinite, this twine!

366
00:21:18,607 --> 00:21:24,822
MATT: All right. You get about a third of the way
through wrapping the rope around his body. He kind

367
00:21:24,822 --> 00:21:32,699
of just sits there looking confused at you. His
jaw looks slack. You continue to wrap, and as you

368
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:38,783
are pulling on the second round, all of a sudden
his expression goes from dull slack, to angry.

369
00:21:38,783 --> 00:21:40,223
TRAVIS AND LAURA: Oh shit.

370
00:21:40,223 --> 00:21:46,577
MATT: He looks down at you, Scanlan goes, "Oops! I
think it's worn off." At which point he makes a

371
00:21:46,577 --> 00:21:52,978
tense, physical action against the rope that
you've bound him with, and before you have a

372
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:57,165
moment to react, with a powerful surge of energy,
breaks through all the rope that you

373
00:21:57,165 --> 00:21:58,380
had tied him on.

374
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,426
LAURA: Great.

375
00:21:59,426 --> 00:22:01,786
MATT: You are now standing at the base of him. At
which--

376
00:22:01,786 --> 00:22:03,507
ASHLEY: Where-- Go for it.

377
00:22:03,507 --> 00:22:04,784
MATT: You guys are on the shore.

378
00:22:04,784 --> 00:22:06,337
LIAM: Yeah, you guys are way far behind.

379
00:22:06,337 --> 00:22:07,892
LAURA: Oh, should we just run?

380
00:22:07,892 --> 00:22:09,175
TRAVIS: He's outside!

381
00:22:09,175 --> 00:22:10,249
LAURA: Scanlan is outside.

382
00:22:10,249 --> 00:22:18,441
MATT: Go, go. Someone let Sam in! All right, so as
this giant entity reaches over and is going to

383
00:22:18,441 --> 00:22:20,717
attempt to try and slam his fist down on top of
you.

384
00:22:20,717 --> 00:22:21,764
LAURA: Ah!

385
00:22:21,764 --> 00:22:24,408
MATT: That is going to be a 21.

386
00:22:24,408 --> 00:22:26,346
LAURA: Against my AC?

387
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:27,785
MATT: Against your armor class, yes.

388
00:22:27,785 --> 00:22:29,171
LAURA: Oh no, that hits me!

389
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:30,248
MATT: All right.

390
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,442
LAURA: That doesn't count.

391
00:22:31,442 --> 00:22:36,858
MATT: You take 14 points of bludgeoning damage, as
the hand just slams down onto your sister.

392
00:22:36,858 --> 00:22:41,415
LIAM: I just run up the thing's back. I rolled 27
for that stealth, so presumably I'm--

393
00:22:41,415 --> 00:22:44,017
MATT: Presumably, he doesn't seem to notice you
there.

394
00:22:44,017 --> 00:22:47,405
LIAM: -- disappeared-ed-ed-ed. Yeah. So I'd like
to stab him in the back.

395
00:22:47,405 --> 00:22:49,710
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an attack roll on
that.

396
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,405
LIAM: Okay.

397
00:22:51,405 --> 00:22:53,006
ORION: Hey, you're wearing a cool shirt.

398
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:55,395
TRAVIS: Hey, buddy!

399
00:22:55,395 --> 00:22:56,561
LIAM: I miss, horribly.

400
00:22:56,561 --> 00:22:57,799
MATT: What'd you roll?

401
00:22:57,799 --> 00:22:59,001
LIAM: A one and a two.

402
00:22:59,001 --> 00:23:00,741
TRAVIS: Did you roll the meteorite yet?

403
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:01,484
LIAM: No, not yet.

404
00:23:01,484 --> 00:23:02,468
TRAVIS: You ding-a-ling!

405
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:04,850
ALL: Scanlan!

406
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,927
LAURA: We need you!

407
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:11,095
SAM: I hope you guys got my word that you did not
try to capture him, did you?

408
00:23:11,095 --> 00:23:13,594
TRAVIS: No, we didn't. And everything's gone
horribly wrong because of that.

409
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:16,545
SAM: No, don't try to-- No, don't capture him,
that's a terrible idea!

410
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:19,240
LAURA: Scanlan, you got me killed!

411
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,953
TRAVIS: That's not what you said.

412
00:23:21,953 --> 00:23:24,734
LAURA: Oh no, it's starting.

413
00:23:24,734 --> 00:23:26,065
LIAM: It's too late.

414
00:23:26,065 --> 00:23:27,770
LAURA: We're already in the giant battle.

415
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:31,087
LIAM: If you had been here five minutes earlier,
you might have helped shape what happened.

416
00:23:31,087 --> 00:23:32,524
SAM: Sorry.

417
00:23:32,524 --> 00:23:36,544
MATT: You do have one reaction to this, as you
stabbed and missed, you have a reaction as well,

418
00:23:36,544 --> 00:23:40,606
after you've taken it. You pull yourself from
under its fist, and it's now starting to get up

419
00:23:40,606 --> 00:23:46,960
onto its feet proper. Oh! What you got?

420
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,426
SAM: He's moving?

421
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,117
MATT: He's getting up now, he was sitting down.

422
00:23:50,117 --> 00:23:53,145
SAM: Bigby's Hand. Grab him. Grapple him.

423
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:54,377
MATT: Okay, all right.

424
00:23:54,377 --> 00:23:55,429
ASHLEY: Grapple him?

425
00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:57,095
SAM: Yeah, I can grapple a massive beast.

426
00:23:57,095 --> 00:23:58,439
MATT: How big?

427
00:23:58,439 --> 00:23:59,926
SAM: It just says "Big."

428
00:23:59,926 --> 00:24:01,116
MATT: A Large?

429
00:24:01,116 --> 00:24:01,993
SAM: No.

430
00:24:01,993 --> 00:24:03,794
MATT: This creature constitutes as Huge.

431
00:24:03,794 --> 00:24:06,152
TRAVIS: Yeah, an ogre comes up to his waist.

432
00:24:06,152 --> 00:24:08,551
SAM: It can grapple a Huge or smaller creature.

433
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:09,882
MATT: That'll do. Yeah.

434
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:11,020
ALL: Yes!

435
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,551
LAURA: Oh wow.

436
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:17,870
MATT: All right, so. So go ahead and make a roll,
a contested roll for that, if you don't mind.

437
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:22,695
(laughter)

438
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,608
SAM: I'm here!

439
00:24:24,608 --> 00:24:27,077
MATT: You got this, you got this.

440
00:24:27,077 --> 00:24:28,698
SAM: Plus what?

441
00:24:28,698 --> 00:24:31,021
MATT: We're going to find out here in a second,
let me pull up the spell.

442
00:24:31,021 --> 00:24:39,816
SAM: I got it right here. Concentration--- No, AC.
The hand has an AC of--- No, here it is.

443
00:24:39,816 --> 00:24:45,533
MATT: All right, so. I got it right here. Grasping
Hand, all right. So use the hand's strength score

444
00:24:45,533 --> 00:24:50,143
to resolve the grapple. So you roll that and add
eight to it. What'd you roll on the d20?

445
00:24:50,143 --> 00:24:51,095
SAM: 18.

446
00:24:51,095 --> 00:24:59,026
MATT: 18? Plus eight, that's 26! All right, versus
its athletics. Okay. So as it's getting up,

447
00:24:59,026 --> 00:25:05,811
suddenly you freak out, bring your hand up, and
you summon that same sparkling wave of arcane

448
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:11,884
energy that shoots out from your hands. Forms this
giant version of your hand. Clings around both his

449
00:25:11,884 --> 00:25:17,800
arms, his torso, and tightens itself around its
body. As it does, it stands up,

450
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,377
and it's currently grappled.

451
00:25:19,377 --> 00:25:20,501
SAM: Yes!

452
00:25:20,501 --> 00:25:22,631
TRAVIS: Good job! You Dominated it earlier.

453
00:25:22,631 --> 00:25:24,628
SAM: I do that with people.

454
00:25:24,628 --> 00:25:26,716
MATT: Yeah, so mark off your Domination.

455
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:28,219
SAM: Okay, got it.

456
00:25:28,219 --> 00:25:34,922
MATT: Also, the target takes 2d6 plus five damage,
crushing, as you're now grabbing

457
00:25:34,922 --> 00:25:36,914
and forcing its body.

458
00:25:36,914 --> 00:25:40,155
SAM: That's not very much, nine points total.

459
00:25:40,155 --> 00:25:48,304
MATT: Nine points of damage total to it. All
right, gotcha. To this wondrous entity. Yay! All

460
00:25:48,304 --> 00:25:58,391
right. All right, great. So that ends your turn.
It is currently grappled.

461
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,276
LAURA: Do I have a reaction?

462
00:26:00,276 --> 00:26:01,603
MATT: It is now your turn.

463
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,429
LAURA: Can I jump away as a reaction?

464
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:09,350
MATT: You can. Go ahead, and we'll say you've been
down here, Scanlan is right here, and you are

465
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:16,278
right here. Not with Trinket, because you went out
to scout and stealth. So that's you there.

466
00:26:16,278 --> 00:26:23,674
LAURA: Can I hit my earring up, and go: Giant!
Giant! Being attacked! Help!

467
00:26:23,674 --> 00:26:24,743
ASHLEY: Can we go?

468
00:26:24,743 --> 00:26:27,681
MATT: You guys hear that, those of you who have
earrings. Shout that out? The rest of you are

469
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:28,600
starting to run.

470
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,455
LIAM AND ASHLEY: (sing) Clang, clang, clang!

471
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:32,014
(laughter)

472
00:26:32,014 --> 00:26:35,307
MATT: At full-round sprints, yeah. It's not going
to be a very quiet walk for Pike.

473
00:26:35,307 --> 00:26:36,671
ASHLEY: Hey, I don't need to be stealthy, now!

474
00:26:36,671 --> 00:26:40,849
MATT: That's okay. It'll take you guys about two
rounds to get there. At a full round. So--

475
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,147
LIAM: Appreciate it.

476
00:26:42,147 --> 00:26:43,940
TRAVIS: I just run towards the pleasant smells.

477
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:53,585
LAURA: And I'm going to take out one of my--
Hunter's Mark! And one of my Sleep arrows. And I

478
00:26:53,585 --> 00:26:55,017
want to shoot it with my Sleep arrow.

479
00:26:55,017 --> 00:26:55,955
TRAVIS: A what?

480
00:26:55,955 --> 00:26:56,943
MATT: Okay.

481
00:26:56,943 --> 00:26:58,641
LAURA: I have a Sleep arrow.

482
00:26:58,641 --> 00:27:00,097
TRAVIS: Awesome. When did that happen?

483
00:27:00,097 --> 00:27:03,247
LAURA: I bought them. But I want Tiberius to make
me more.

484
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,724
ORION: You what?

485
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:07,842
LAURA: I've asked for more Sleep arrows, if you
can make them.

486
00:27:07,842 --> 00:27:10,633
ORION: It takes a while for me to do that.

487
00:27:10,633 --> 00:27:11,781
LAURA: Oh shit.

488
00:27:11,781 --> 00:27:13,171
TALIESIN: You also still have a Grapple arrow.

489
00:27:13,171 --> 00:27:14,005
LAURA: And that, I know!

490
00:27:14,005 --> 00:27:15,174
TRAVIS: So we've got two rounds to--

491
00:27:15,174 --> 00:27:19,117
LAURA: But after the rope, I'm going to try to
Sleep.

492
00:27:19,117 --> 00:27:20,461
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know, I know.

493
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:23,432
ORION: It takes like at least a few hours to make
Sleep arrows, right?

494
00:27:23,432 --> 00:27:26,728
MATT: Oh, it takes a while to make a Sleep arrow,
yeah. It takes like-- Yeah, we'll go into that

495
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:30,936
later. All right so, you go ahead and pull out the
single arrow first, or Sleep arrow first?

496
00:27:30,936 --> 00:27:32,710
LAURA: Sleep arrow first.

497
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:35,139
MATT: Okay. You realize if you damage something
that's asleep, it wakes back up?

498
00:27:35,139 --> 00:27:36,974
MARISHA: Yeah, put him to sleep.

499
00:27:36,974 --> 00:27:37,975
LAURA: Yeah.

500
00:27:37,975 --> 00:27:40,414
MATT: I'm saying if you do Sleep arrow first, you
hit him, then you do a second,

501
00:27:40,414 --> 00:27:41,354
it'll wake back up.

502
00:27:41,354 --> 00:27:43,843
LAURA: Oh, okay. I'm going to do the first arrow
and then I'll try to put him to sleep. Okay,

503
00:27:43,843 --> 00:27:45,160
smart. Thank you.

504
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,371
MATT: Just letting you know.

505
00:27:47,371 --> 00:27:50,724
LAURA: I know, right? 25 for the first hit.

506
00:27:50,724 --> 00:27:53,632
MATT: Okay. 25 definitely hits.

507
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:57,802
LAURA: Oh, then eight, and--

508
00:27:57,802 --> 00:28:00,250
SAM: (shaky flute music)

509
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:04,263
LAURA: 16 for the first hit.

510
00:28:04,263 --> 00:28:06,245
MATT: 16 damage for the first hit.

511
00:28:06,245 --> 00:28:08,285
LAURA: And then Sleep arrow.

512
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:10,239
LAURA and ASHLEY: Oh, natural 20!

513
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:12,263
(cheering)

514
00:28:12,263 --> 00:28:13,642
MATT: Fantastic!

515
00:28:13,642 --> 00:28:15,085
ASHLEY: Nighty night!

516
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:16,427
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage on that!

517
00:28:16,427 --> 00:28:19,519
SAM: (shaky flute music)

518
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:20,873
LAURA: Eight!

519
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:22,028
SAM: Get used to that sound.

520
00:28:22,028 --> 00:28:26,200
LAURA: Eight plus seven is 15, 16, 17. Plus
Hunter's Mark.

521
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,491
MATT: Did you multiply the dice?

522
00:28:27,491 --> 00:28:28,631
LAURA: Oh, no!

523
00:28:28,631 --> 00:28:29,672
MATT: That's a critical hit.

524
00:28:29,672 --> 00:28:35,174
LAURA: Oh sweet. Eight, 16, do I add the two for
the bracers on that?

525
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:37,691
MATT: Not for the multiplication, no. It's after
the fact.

526
00:28:37,691 --> 00:28:41,745
LAURA: Okay, 16, 20, what is that? 23, 24, 25.

527
00:28:41,745 --> 00:28:42,784
MATT: 25.

528
00:28:42,784 --> 00:28:44,010
LAURA: Plus Hunter's Mark?

529
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,502
MATT: Yep.

530
00:28:45,502 --> 00:28:46,838
LAURA: Five for Hunter's Mark.

531
00:28:46,838 --> 00:28:47,708
LIAM: Nice!

532
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:48,703
MATT: 30 damage.

533
00:28:48,703 --> 00:28:49,754
ASHLEY: You put him in a coma.

534
00:28:49,754 --> 00:28:50,652
LIAM: Nice!

535
00:28:50,652 --> 00:28:51,573
ASHLEY: He's not just sleeping.

536
00:28:51,573 --> 00:28:54,091
MATT: All right, so as it's still standing up and
you see as he's standing up now, he's reaching off

537
00:28:54,091 --> 00:28:58,074
to the side and he's pulling a giant club up that
was kind of leaning against the side of the inner

538
00:28:58,074 --> 00:29:02,362
portion of this giant fighter's ring.

539
00:29:02,362 --> 00:29:03,325
TRAVIS: Good choice.

540
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:06,368
MATT: As he pulls the club up, you pierce him in
the arm with the first arrow and he looks down at

541
00:29:06,368 --> 00:29:11,352
you angrily. With his one giant eye glaring, and
the smaller one. The second arrow pierces the

542
00:29:11,352 --> 00:29:19,899
smaller eye and he pulls the arrow out with his
fingers, like a little tweezers, angrily. I will

543
00:29:19,899 --> 00:29:24,561
say, because it was a critical hit on a Sleep
arrow, normally, what you would roll is 5d8 to see

544
00:29:24,561 --> 00:29:27,208
how many hit points it can affect. Go ahead and
roll 10d8.

545
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:28,847
ALL: Whoa!

546
00:29:28,847 --> 00:29:32,259
MATT: It's not damage. This is just to see whether
or not you can put it to sleep.

547
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:33,470
LAURA: Oh, really?

548
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,153
MARISHA: Oh, he's got to have a--

549
00:29:35,153 --> 00:29:49,485
LAURA: That's 12, okay. 16, 28. And then I get
another--

550
00:29:49,485 --> 00:29:51,174
TRAVIS: Four more.

551
00:29:51,174 --> 00:29:55,143
MARISHA: I've got access to this thing. Let me
show you.

552
00:29:55,143 --> 00:29:57,001
LIAM: You're at 39.

553
00:29:57,001 --> 00:29:58,983
SAM: Math is happening here. Action Math!

554
00:29:58,983 --> 00:30:00,182
LAURA: Wait, one more.

555
00:30:00,182 --> 00:30:01,753
MATT AND ORION: Action Math.

556
00:30:01,753 --> 00:30:02,984
LIAM: Aw. 47.

557
00:30:02,984 --> 00:30:04,160
LAURA: 47?

558
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,258
MATT: 47.

559
00:30:05,258 --> 00:30:06,170
ORION: Nice!

560
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,568
SAM: That's some hot math.

561
00:30:07,568 --> 00:30:10,104
MATT: So, the arrow pierces him and he pulls it
out, and you can see for a second

562
00:30:10,104 --> 00:30:11,832
the eye gets a little--

563
00:30:11,832 --> 00:30:13,272
LAURA: Oh, come on, come on.

564
00:30:13,272 --> 00:30:16,847
MATT: He flicks the arrow off and it snaps as it
leaves his fingers, and he glares down at you with

565
00:30:16,847 --> 00:30:19,655
his other eye, angrily. Shrugs off the effect.

566
00:30:19,655 --> 00:30:21,041
ASHLEY: No!

567
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:22,923
LAURA: Man! That would have been-- that's
impossible!

568
00:30:22,923 --> 00:30:25,467
MATT: That would have been really cool.
Unfortunately, he still has a lot of hit points

569
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:29,817
left. Sleep arrow is something to glide into later
in the battle.

570
00:30:29,817 --> 00:30:31,482
TRAVIS: Oh, that makes sense.

571
00:30:31,482 --> 00:30:33,633
LAURA: Oh, that does make sense.

572
00:30:33,633 --> 00:30:34,850
TRAVIS: How many would've done it?

573
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,160
LAURA: He can't tell us that.

574
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,599
MATT: You don't know that. No fucking-- You're
still on the beach!

575
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:42,557
LAURA: Did I still do 47 damage on that Sleep
arrow? Or that was just--

576
00:30:42,557 --> 00:30:44,480
MATT: Oh no, you still did the 30 damage from the
Sleep arrow.

577
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,492
LAURA: Okay, okay.

578
00:30:45,492 --> 00:30:48,469
MATT: That was just to see how much hit points it
would affect if it was going to put him to sleep.

579
00:30:48,469 --> 00:30:49,787
But a nice try.

580
00:30:49,787 --> 00:30:50,746
LAURA: All right.

581
00:30:50,746 --> 00:30:54,631
MATT: All right, so that ends your turn. That
brings us back to the top of the round between you

582
00:30:54,631 --> 00:30:57,390
guys. So we'll wait for the rest to arrive before
we do full initiative. We're just running off of

583
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:00,629
the sequence of events here. Did you want to move
at all or are you going to stay right here?

584
00:31:00,629 --> 00:31:03,068
LAURA: I want to run as far away as possible from
him.

585
00:31:03,068 --> 00:31:10,175
MATT: Okay. So, as you start running backward,
we'll say to about there, he has a very long reach

586
00:31:10,175 --> 00:31:15,473
with a club and he gets to swing at you as a
reaction. So as you go bolting, he just takes the

587
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,986
giant club around (whoosh).

588
00:31:17,986 --> 00:31:19,749
LAURA: You're not groggy at all, you little--

589
00:31:19,749 --> 00:31:21,141
MATT: Streaks it across the ground.

590
00:31:21,141 --> 00:31:22,422
SAM: You're grappled.

591
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:31,738
MATT: Yep, which means he's in a bad situation and
he, because he is grappled, it means he can't move

592
00:31:31,738 --> 00:31:34,819
from his current spot. He's being held in place.
His speed is zero.

593
00:31:34,819 --> 00:31:36,496
LIAM: Checking the stats.

594
00:31:36,496 --> 00:31:39,226
MATT: But he still manages to roll a 14 to hit.

595
00:31:39,226 --> 00:31:40,830
LAURA: And he doesn't hit me.

596
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:44,270
MATT: All right, so you jump over the club.

597
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,320
LAURA: Sweet.

598
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,773
MATT: Roll off the ground, turn around. Get your
bow back in ready position, untouched. That's the

599
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:50,616
end of your turn. Now it's his turn.

600
00:31:50,616 --> 00:31:51,808
LAURA: Oh god!

601
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:57,539
MATT: He is going to-- Did you throw the daggers
or did you leap up to try and backstab him there?

602
00:31:57,539 --> 00:31:59,238
LIAM: I tried to backstab him so I'm right
behind.

603
00:31:59,238 --> 00:32:00,916
MATT: Right, so you're right there. He--

604
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:02,734
LIAM: He's gonna shit on me, isn't he?

605
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:09,234
MATT: -- spins around. Bends down, just glares at
you with his one giant yellowish eye with almost a

606
00:32:09,234 --> 00:32:10,996
slit pupil in it.

607
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:12,371
LIAM: Hello, handsome.

608
00:32:12,371 --> 00:32:16,424
MATT: As it does, you feel this strange,
oppressive force come from the eye into your mind,

609
00:32:16,424 --> 00:32:20,820
and I need you to go ahead and roll a charisma
saving throw.

610
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,093
TRAVIS: Roll the meteorite.

611
00:32:22,093 --> 00:32:23,686
LIAM: I'm going to use the meteorite.

612
00:32:23,686 --> 00:32:25,081
LAURA: All right, come on, meteorite.

613
00:32:25,081 --> 00:32:26,850
LIAM: That's better. 17.

614
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,570
MATT: 17?

615
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,748
LIAM: Yes.

616
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:36,496
MATT: You manage to resist whatever effect this
was. You shrug it off. It looks at you angrily

617
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:39,817
even more and takes its club and slams it into the
ground, like a giant pouty child.

618
00:32:39,817 --> 00:32:41,151
LIAM: (retches) Sorry.

619
00:32:41,151 --> 00:32:44,813
MATT: It looks like it's-- Yeah. The smell is
still present in your face. Pulls its club up to

620
00:32:44,813 --> 00:32:51,483
prepare itself for its next round. That's its
turn. Oh, no, sorry. It also makes one attack, it

621
00:32:51,483 --> 00:32:54,695
gets to use the evil eye, and one attack. So,
angrily, it's gonna lift up its club and slam down

622
00:32:54,695 --> 00:32:55,663
towards you.

623
00:32:55,663 --> 00:32:56,617
LIAM: Yes.

624
00:32:56,617 --> 00:32:59,177
MATT: That is going to be a 15 versus AC?

625
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,302
LIAM: No, sorry.

626
00:33:00,302 --> 00:33:04,846
MATT: Can't roll worth crap today. Club comes down
(impact sound). Actually breaks a good portion of

627
00:33:04,846 --> 00:33:08,333
the stone on the side of this that comes up,
falling backward and tumbling into a pile inside

628
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:14,847
this pit. As you dodge out of the way. That ends
its turn. No, you're up.

629
00:33:14,847 --> 00:33:15,891
LIAM: I'm up?

630
00:33:15,891 --> 00:33:18,737
MATT: Scanlan. No, Scanlan first, and then you,
and then you. So Scanlan.

631
00:33:18,737 --> 00:33:19,647
SAM: Oh, me?

632
00:33:19,647 --> 00:33:20,395
MATT: Yes.

633
00:33:20,395 --> 00:33:21,269
SAM: I get to do more?

634
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:22,412
MATT: Yes.

635
00:33:22,412 --> 00:33:23,671
SAM: But he's a giant, and I'm a little thing.

636
00:33:23,671 --> 00:33:25,066
MATT: Yes, you are. Yes, he is.

637
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:27,693
SAM: I guess I should hit him. I'm going to hit
him with a Lightning Bolt.

638
00:33:27,693 --> 00:33:28,672
LIAM: You should come in close.

639
00:33:28,672 --> 00:33:29,962
MATT: Okay.

640
00:33:29,962 --> 00:33:31,142
SAM: I should come in close?

641
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:33,474
LIAM: Then I can fuck him up.

642
00:33:33,474 --> 00:33:36,748
SAM: Oh. But he's big, and I'm little!

643
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,799
LAURA: No, don't come in close, seriously.

644
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,584
TRAVIS: You're real little, like the size of a
toe.

645
00:33:40,584 --> 00:33:43,316
LAURA: Honestly, he can still get you from where
you're at. Unless you move further away.

646
00:33:43,316 --> 00:33:49,079
LIAM: Yeah, so it's the same: right up against him
or five feet back. Same same! If you move away,

647
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:54,232
he's gonna take a swing. I'm not saying any of
this, I'm just thinking it, furiously.

648
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,200
SAM: Yes, thinking it at me.

649
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,470
ORION: You yell it across.

650
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:02,572
SAM: I'll just make-- Does Lightning Bolt come
from me, or can--

651
00:34:02,572 --> 00:34:04,999
MATT: Yes, it comes from you. And it goes in a
straight direction.

652
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:08,237
SAM: Well then, I have to move anyway, so that I
don't strike Vax or Vex.

653
00:34:08,237 --> 00:34:12,386
MATT: You get the feeling he has about a 15 foot
reach with this, so as long as you stay within

654
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:14,292
that reach, you're still gonna be okay.

655
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:16,511
SAM: Well, will I hit either of my fellows from
where I'm--

656
00:34:16,511 --> 00:34:18,258
MATT: Currently? Yes.

657
00:34:18,258 --> 00:34:19,597
SAM: Yeah, then I need to move.

658
00:34:19,597 --> 00:34:21,344
MATT: You do. Where are you going to move?

659
00:34:21,344 --> 00:34:22,883
TRAVIS: What, they can't take it?

660
00:34:22,883 --> 00:34:24,755
SAM: That ring, is that high? Low?

661
00:34:24,755 --> 00:34:28,310
MATT: It's 15 feet up, so you can jump down into
the ring if you wanted to go down there. Or you

662
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,674
can move around this way.

663
00:34:29,674 --> 00:34:35,631
SAM: Oh gosh. I don't really jump well. All right,
I'm going to jump into the ring, I guess. And then

664
00:34:35,631 --> 00:34:38,670
can I shoot from there or will the wall be in my
way?

665
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,076
MATT: He's big enough where you'd be able to see
him.

666
00:34:40,076 --> 00:34:40,866
SAM: Okay.

667
00:34:40,866 --> 00:34:46,978
MATT: So you leap off the side. As you leap in the
air, he glances over with his large eye and does a

668
00:34:46,978 --> 00:34:51,165
backswing with the club in mid-air, trying to
basically baseball-swing you.

669
00:34:51,165 --> 00:34:52,560
SAM: Oh, he'll hit me.

670
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,468
MATT: We'll find out. That is an 18?

671
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,615
SAM: Oh yeah.

672
00:34:56,615 --> 00:35:02,710
MATT: Okay. You take 19 points of bludgeoning
damage. As he (impact sound).

673
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,910
TRAVIS: Tee-balls you.

674
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:06,121
MATT: Really. Like, backhand swing hits you.

675
00:35:06,121 --> 00:35:07,385
SAM: (high-pitched) Ah!

676
00:35:07,385 --> 00:35:11,428
MATT: Go ahead and make an acrobatics check.
Because your landing has now completely thrown you

677
00:35:11,428 --> 00:35:13,911
topsy-turvy, the impact throwing you off your
balance.

678
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,195
(laughter)

679
00:35:15,195 --> 00:35:16,798
SAM: Does a 20-- Is that good?

680
00:35:16,798 --> 00:35:17,811
MATT: 20 will do.

681
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:19,320
ASHLEY: 20 will do!

682
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,909
MATT: Like a cat, you correct your trajectory in
mid-air and still three-point land.

683
00:35:22,909 --> 00:35:25,879
(laughter)

684
00:35:25,879 --> 00:35:33,147
MATT: Down below. You're down in the pit, you're
looking up. This gargantuan humanoid is still

685
00:35:33,147 --> 00:35:37,214
standing above you, looking down hissing at you as
you still manage to not be affected by its swing

686
00:35:37,214 --> 00:35:40,168
at you. You can now cast your spell if you'd
like.

687
00:35:40,168 --> 00:35:44,043
SAM: Okay, I will cast Lightning Bolt on his face
and neck area.

688
00:35:44,043 --> 00:35:45,056
MATT: All right.

689
00:35:45,056 --> 00:35:45,921
TRAVIS: Good.

690
00:35:45,921 --> 00:35:47,475
MATT: Go ahead and roll 8d6.

691
00:35:47,475 --> 00:35:49,425
SAM: 8d6, give me those sixes.

692
00:35:49,425 --> 00:35:51,413
ORION: Boom! How many do you need? I got much.

693
00:35:51,413 --> 00:35:52,861
SAM: I need all of them.

694
00:35:52,861 --> 00:35:54,935
MATT: Dexterity, he does not make his saving
throw.

695
00:35:54,935 --> 00:35:55,841
TRAVIS: Yes!

696
00:35:55,841 --> 00:35:58,277
MATT: He is too slow at that size.

697
00:35:58,277 --> 00:36:03,522
SAM: Ooh, a lot of sixes. Six, six, six.

698
00:36:03,522 --> 00:36:05,999
ORION: What am I doing right now?

699
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:07,791
MATT: You guys are running up to--

700
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:08,766
SAM: 31.

701
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:09,972
MATT: 31 total?

702
00:36:09,972 --> 00:36:11,401
LAURA: 31?! Nice.

703
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:12,622
TRAVIS: All right. Drop it.

704
00:36:12,622 --> 00:36:16,751
MATT: So after you land on your foot, you turn
around, and reactively just fire this bolt of

705
00:36:16,751 --> 00:36:21,565
bluish, arcane energy. It streaks up, slams into
his face and shoulder area. You can see he rears

706
00:36:21,565 --> 00:36:27,606
back from the pain of it, reaching up in the air
like he can somehow fight off the Lightning Bolt.

707
00:36:27,606 --> 00:36:32,697
As the bolt passes through him, it leaves this
burn mark on his chest and the side of his face.

708
00:36:32,697 --> 00:36:36,165
Smoke is (sizzle) up off his torso. He looks very
pissed.

709
00:36:36,165 --> 00:36:37,531
SAM: Do I get my bonus?

710
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:38,802
MATT: You do.

711
00:36:38,802 --> 00:36:41,962
SAM: Can I give Inspiration to mister Vax over
there?

712
00:36:41,962 --> 00:36:43,168
MATT: You may.

713
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:45,347
SAM: (bad flute playing)

714
00:36:45,347 --> 00:36:46,671
TRAVIS: I don't know, can you?

715
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,658
SAM: (slightly less bad flute playing)

716
00:36:48,658 --> 00:36:50,132
TRAVIS: There you go.

717
00:36:50,132 --> 00:36:52,686
MARISHA: Yeah, some Jethro Tull up in here.

718
00:36:52,686 --> 00:36:55,502
LIAM: (sings) You got the touch! You got the
power!

719
00:36:55,502 --> 00:37:03,988
MATT: I will say the mild, echoing sound of mildly
off-key whistle following a mighty Lightning Bolt,

720
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,158
is inspiring enough. Go ahead and take a d10.

721
00:37:06,158 --> 00:37:07,429
LIAM: Okay.

722
00:37:07,429 --> 00:37:09,224
MATT: And now it is your turn.

723
00:37:09,224 --> 00:37:14,701
LIAM: I'm going to use that. I want to make an
acrobatics check. I want to jump up on this guy's

724
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:20,440
knee, and then dagger-dagger right into his
strange eye that he tried to mess with me.

725
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,595
MATT: Okay, so are you going directly for the
eye?

726
00:37:22,595 --> 00:37:25,696
LIAM: The eye, yeah, so I want to jump up his
body, off his knee.

727
00:37:25,696 --> 00:37:27,389
LAURA: (sultry) Jump up his body.

728
00:37:27,389 --> 00:37:29,585
LIAM: So what do I do? Acrobatics check first?

729
00:37:29,585 --> 00:37:30,861
MATT: Acrobatics check.

730
00:37:30,861 --> 00:37:37,760
LIAM: Okay, so four. I'm going to use Luck. 19 for
the second, so that's 19 plus 13, so I'm pretty

731
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,001
sure I succeed.

732
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:42,065
MATT: So as he's reeling back from the blast of
the Lightning Bolt, you see that opportunity. You

733
00:37:42,065 --> 00:37:45,826
jump up onto his partially bent knee, use that as
a platform and leap up in the air, daggers drawn.

734
00:37:45,826 --> 00:37:51,821
Slow motion towards its face. Go ahead and make
your first attack, since you are going directly

735
00:37:51,821 --> 00:37:52,840
for the eye--

736
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,891
LIAM: Yes?

737
00:37:53,891 --> 00:37:57,596
MATT: I will say that it is at a disadvantage on
the attack, but if it hits, it will be considered

738
00:37:57,596 --> 00:37:59,169
as a Sneak Attack.

739
00:37:59,169 --> 00:37:59,982
LIAM: Say that again.

740
00:37:59,982 --> 00:38:04,770
MATT: I will say it's a disadvantage on the
attack, but if it hits him in his eye, you will do

741
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,147
Sneak Attack damage.

742
00:38:06,147 --> 00:38:07,179
TRAVIS: Roll well.

743
00:38:07,179 --> 00:38:09,595
LIAM: All right, meteorite die.

744
00:38:09,595 --> 00:38:16,143
No good. First one's no good, second dagger.
That's good, and that's also good, identical, so

745
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,545
that is a 26.

746
00:38:18,545 --> 00:38:21,865
MATT: 26. All right, that one will hit.

747
00:38:21,865 --> 00:38:28,615
LIAM: Thank you, meteorite die. Okay, so this is
1d-- durdee durdeedoo?

748
00:38:28,615 --> 00:38:30,687
ASHLEY: Hurkee durkee durkee.

749
00:38:30,687 --> 00:38:36,565
LIAM: Okay, that's a two, plus six is eight.

750
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:38,681
MATT: Eight, plus your 5d6.

751
00:38:38,681 --> 00:38:40,166
LIAM: Oh, this is a Sneak Attack?

752
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:41,447
LAURA: Because you hit him in the eye.

753
00:38:41,447 --> 00:38:42,852
MATT: Oh, this is the second attack that you did,
right?

754
00:38:42,852 --> 00:38:43,681
LIAM: Yeah.

755
00:38:43,681 --> 00:38:45,534
MATT: Technically, you were both going for the
eye. I'll say, I'll allow it.

756
00:38:45,534 --> 00:38:54,219
LIAM: Hey, you're a nice guy. Eight, is 12. And is
17. And 18. And 22. And is 26.

757
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:55,839
MATT: 26 points of damage.

758
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,095
LIAM: Eyeball.

759
00:38:57,095 --> 00:39:01,632
MATT: So, the first dagger you attempt to swing
down, he actually moves his face out of the way

760
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:05,682
and it just scrapes across the side of his cheek,
doing nothing more than a scratch. But the second

761
00:39:05,682 --> 00:39:12,633
blade strikes true, slamming into the side of the
eye. As it pierces, for an eye, you expect, would

762
00:39:12,633 --> 00:39:16,454
pop. It's still a hearty material. You actually
have to push into it, it's almost like it's full

763
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:21,091
of hot muscle on the inside of its eye. The dagger
still drives in, and, using your weight, you drag

764
00:39:21,091 --> 00:39:25,334
down and cut it open on the bottom. It screams out
in pain and pushes you off. You barely manage to

765
00:39:25,334 --> 00:39:26,883
catch yourself on the ground.

766
00:39:26,883 --> 00:39:28,310
ASHLEY: Oh, come on!

767
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:32,298
MATT: You haven't, seemingly, blinded him, but
you've definitely left a serious

768
00:39:32,298 --> 00:39:34,178
mark on his eyeball.

769
00:39:34,178 --> 00:39:36,277
LAURA: Ugh. He's huge!

770
00:39:36,277 --> 00:39:38,508
MATT: Do you want to use your movement at all, you
can, or do you wanna stay where you are?

771
00:39:38,508 --> 00:39:46,460
LIAM: I will Disengage and move back, which means
that he can't take a swing.

772
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,975
MATT: Right, you can use your bonus action. Oh,
you used your bonus action

773
00:39:49,975 --> 00:39:52,593
to do your secondary attack.

774
00:39:52,593 --> 00:39:59,035
LIAM: I'm pretty sure I get that on top of that,
as a Rogue hoo-hah. But I'll stay there if you

775
00:39:59,035 --> 00:40:02,449
want. I'm in no mood to argue with you tonight.

776
00:40:02,449 --> 00:40:03,656
MATT: I know, I know.

777
00:40:03,656 --> 00:40:04,607
TRAVIS: Yeah, right?

778
00:40:04,607 --> 00:40:07,040
MATT: I'm pretty sure as a rogue you can use your
bonus action to do Disengage, that's one of the

779
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,929
benefits. But you used it as a secondary attack to
get Sneak Attack, so. You could move out of the

780
00:40:10,929 --> 00:40:12,487
way, but you'll take a swing from him.

781
00:40:12,487 --> 00:40:16,036
LIAM: Okay. Yeah, I'll move back.

782
00:40:16,036 --> 00:40:17,200
MATT: All right.

783
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,101
LIAM: Sure.

784
00:40:18,101 --> 00:40:19,339
MATT: So you'd say you'd move back to about
there?

785
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:20,446
LIAM: Yeah.

786
00:40:20,446 --> 00:40:24,013
MATT: As you do, he reaches up and grabs his eye.
With the other hand, picks up the club and

787
00:40:24,013 --> 00:40:28,259
backhand swings at you. That'll be a 19.

788
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,324
LIAM: That hits.

789
00:40:29,324 --> 00:40:31,196
TRAVIS: Couldn't just let him go in the trees.

790
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:36,469
MATT: You take 19 points of bludgeoning damage.
But as the hit slams into your back, you manage to

791
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:40,083
just catch your feet underneath you so you don't
topple off the top of this edge.

792
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:41,767
LIAM: Okay.

793
00:40:41,767 --> 00:40:43,948
MATT: Ends your turn. What you got, Vex?

794
00:40:43,948 --> 00:40:48,974
LAURA: Hi. I'm going to do Hail of Thorns on him.

795
00:40:48,974 --> 00:40:50,319
MATT: All right, so you pull back.

796
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:51,490
LAURA: Yeah.

797
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:56,271
MATT: Same wooden shaft, all of a sudden, sprouts
these nice, thorny, jagged spikes on the sides, as

798
00:40:56,271 --> 00:40:57,668
you release the arrow.

799
00:40:57,668 --> 00:40:58,763
LAURA: 26?

800
00:40:58,763 --> 00:40:59,729
MATT: Hits him.

801
00:40:59,729 --> 00:41:04,538
LAURA: Okay, so that would be-- I'm doing it at a
level three, so that is 3d10.

802
00:41:04,538 --> 00:41:06,385
MATT: 3d10 damage. Go ahead and roll that.

803
00:41:06,385 --> 00:41:22,518
LAURA: 15, 16. That 16? Yeah, 16 damage for that,
plus my Hunter's Mark. 17.

804
00:41:22,518 --> 00:41:24,208
MATT: 17?

805
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:25,564
LAURA: And then my second attack?

806
00:41:25,564 --> 00:41:27,024
MATT: Second attack. Go ahead and roll it.

807
00:41:27,024 --> 00:41:30,373
LAURA: All right. 17?

808
00:41:30,373 --> 00:41:36,280
MATT: 17 does hit. He's pretty big. He's a big ol'
sack of hit points and no armor.

809
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,866
LAURA: 15, 16, 17.

810
00:41:38,866 --> 00:41:39,868
MATT: 17.

811
00:41:39,868 --> 00:41:40,871
LAURA: Oh, plus Hunter's Mark!

812
00:41:40,871 --> 00:41:42,613
MATT: Yep, don't forget your Hunter's Mark.

813
00:41:42,613 --> 00:41:43,985
LAURA: Five for Hunter's Mark.

814
00:41:43,985 --> 00:41:50,268
MATT: Okay, so 22. Nice. All right, so, one arrow
hits him in the elbow and it looks like it pierces

815
00:41:50,268 --> 00:41:54,763
the sinew that holds the arm. Almost goes slack
for a second before he flexes and tenses. You hear

816
00:41:54,763 --> 00:42:00,523
the actual wood shaft snap as he brings his
forearm up. Grabbing his club, turning around, you

817
00:42:00,523 --> 00:42:03,577
shoot the back of his elbow, causing him to drop
the club on this hand. He looks extremely

818
00:42:03,577 --> 00:42:06,403
frustrated at the process. Now he's got blood
streaking down both arms.

819
00:42:06,403 --> 00:42:07,537
TRAVIS: Yes!

820
00:42:07,537 --> 00:42:10,028
MATT: He reaches down to grab the club, again, to
try and prepare himself for

821
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,613
another round of attacks.

822
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,525
MARISHA: Are we there yet?

823
00:42:13,525 --> 00:42:15,820
MATT: You guys are just now arriving.

824
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,738
LAURA: Oh!

825
00:42:16,738 --> 00:42:18,948
MATT: The Fomorian is going to finish its turn,
and then the rest of you guys can go.

826
00:42:18,948 --> 00:42:20,117
TALIESIN: Yeah!

827
00:42:20,117 --> 00:42:26,700
MATT: He's going to take two swings. First, he's
going go ahead and angrily leap forward to there.

828
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:31,315
Small jump. Lands on the ground, takes one swing
at each of you.

829
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:32,488
SAM: Can he move?

830
00:42:32,488 --> 00:42:33,649
MARISHA: Is he still grappled?

831
00:42:33,649 --> 00:42:35,644
MATT: Actually, no that's a valid point. He is
still grappled. Thank you for that.

832
00:42:35,644 --> 00:42:37,190
LAURA: Yeah! Woo!

833
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:43,673
MATT: He's going to try and break from the grapple
for his move. That is going to be an athletics of

834
00:42:43,673 --> 00:42:47,418
20. Go ahead and roll a d20 and add eight.

835
00:42:47,418 --> 00:42:48,699
MARISHA: Come on!

836
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,992
SAM: 18 plus eight.

837
00:42:50,992 --> 00:42:52,466
(cheering)

838
00:42:52,466 --> 00:42:56,119
MATT: Attempts to break free of grapple, can't do,
so he's stuck where he is. He currently has

839
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:57,689
nothing in range to attack.

840
00:42:57,689 --> 00:42:58,791
SAM: Except for me.

841
00:42:58,791 --> 00:43:04,235
MATT: No, you're 15 feet below, he doesn't have
range on you at the moment. He tries to take a

842
00:43:04,235 --> 00:43:08,568
swing at you, but partially because he's so high
up, he cannot move. And because you are so small,

843
00:43:08,568 --> 00:43:13,562
you literally just stand there as the swing-- The
wind blows your hair back a little bit.

844
00:43:13,562 --> 00:43:14,991
SAM: Ooh!

845
00:43:14,991 --> 00:43:16,322
(laughter)

846
00:43:16,322 --> 00:43:17,862
MATT: But does not find purchase on your body.

847
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:20,087
SAM: I'm a little dainty gnome!

848
00:43:20,087 --> 00:43:21,785
(laughter)

849
00:43:21,785 --> 00:43:29,470
MATT: Completely wasted its turn, well done. All
right, so that brings us to you, again. Actually,

850
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:32,099
no. It now goes to everyone else because they have
all arrived on the scene now.

851
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:33,865
SAM: Right, good, thank god.

852
00:43:33,865 --> 00:43:36,098
MATT: You guys are all starting to appear. We'll
say--

853
00:43:36,098 --> 00:43:38,027
SAM: Don't kill the giant!

854
00:43:38,027 --> 00:43:39,841
MATT: Over this area.

855
00:43:39,841 --> 00:43:40,945
SAM: Don't kill him.

856
00:43:40,945 --> 00:43:42,172
ASHLEY: Don't kill him, still?

857
00:43:42,172 --> 00:43:43,959
SAM: Don't kill him, we need him.

858
00:43:43,959 --> 00:43:45,292
LAURA: For what?

859
00:43:45,292 --> 00:43:46,471
ASHLEY: How are we going to use him?

860
00:43:46,471 --> 00:43:49,747
SAM: We have a mind flayer, we have magicians, we
have all sorts of things. He is our wrecking ball.

861
00:43:49,747 --> 00:43:50,959
He's our way in.

862
00:43:50,959 --> 00:43:57,873
MARISHA: Yeah, if we can keep him controlled. I
can get him mind-controlled on our team

863
00:43:57,873 --> 00:43:58,960
for 30 days.

864
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,024
SAM: Yeah, yeah. He is our ticket into the
palace.

865
00:44:01,024 --> 00:44:03,180
LAURA: All right.

866
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,810
MARISHA: He's going to be like that one scene in
Lord of the Rings.

867
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,141
LAURA: Ooh, I like it.

868
00:44:08,141 --> 00:44:09,185
TALIESIN: That one scene?

869
00:44:09,185 --> 00:44:10,757
LIAM: Where he ate the Lembas bread?

870
00:44:10,757 --> 00:44:12,025
TALIESIN: I love that one scene.

871
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:14,717
MATT: So, who's going first?

872
00:44:14,717 --> 00:44:16,570
TALIESIN: Should we roll initiative?

873
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,637
MATT: All right.

874
00:44:17,637 --> 00:44:18,958
TALIESIN: Okay.

875
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:20,680
LAURA: Oh, we haven't rolled!

876
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,025
LIAM: Everybody all together, now?

877
00:44:22,025 --> 00:44:24,252
MATT: Everyone all together, now. All together,
now!

878
00:44:24,252 --> 00:44:26,034
TALIESIN: (sings) All together, now.

879
00:44:26,034 --> 00:44:28,332
TRAVIS: Is he a giant? Like a giant?

880
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,887
MATT: He's considered a giant.

881
00:44:29,887 --> 00:44:31,036
TRAVIS: I speak Giant!

882
00:44:31,036 --> 00:44:32,938
MARISHA: You speak Giant?!

883
00:44:32,938 --> 00:44:34,260
LAURA: Say something, Grog!

884
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,275
TRAVIS: I speak Giant!

885
00:44:35,275 --> 00:44:36,242
ORION: Oh, good.

886
00:44:36,242 --> 00:44:38,123
TRAVIS: Oh, I can use my brain for something?

887
00:44:38,123 --> 00:44:46,787
MATT: All right, so we have 25 to 20? 25 to 20. 20
to 15.

888
00:44:46,787 --> 00:44:47,987
ORION: 18.

889
00:44:47,987 --> 00:44:49,061
ASHLEY: 18.

890
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:49,901
LAURA: Yeah!

891
00:44:49,901 --> 00:44:51,046
TRAVIS: 17.

892
00:44:51,046 --> 00:44:52,041
LIAM: Cleric and the sorcerer.

893
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:53,276
ORION: That close, Ash.

894
00:44:53,276 --> 00:44:54,521
ASHLEY: I don't like going first.

895
00:44:54,521 --> 00:44:56,380
ORION: That close to just spitting out all my
coffee.

896
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:57,618
ASHLEY: I like picking up the pieces.

897
00:44:57,618 --> 00:44:58,880
MATT: 15 to ten.

898
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,763
TALIESIN: 12.

899
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:00,835
LIAM: 13.

900
00:45:00,835 --> 00:45:02,424
MATT: Okay.

901
00:45:02,424 --> 00:45:03,795
MARISHA AND TALIESIN: 12.

902
00:45:03,795 --> 00:45:11,940
MATT: All right, so Percy and Keyleth. All right,
so, ten to five. Ten to five?

903
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,099
LIAM: Five.

904
00:45:13,099 --> 00:45:15,520
LAURA: Oh! That's me, I'm an eight.

905
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,322
MATT: You're an eight, all right. We got Vex--

906
00:45:17,322 --> 00:45:18,910
LAURA: That's Trinket, too.

907
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:21,611
MARISHA: He's so cuddly!

908
00:45:21,611 --> 00:45:25,319
MATT: All right, that is almost everyone. Who--

909
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:26,750
SAM: One!

910
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:32,031
MATT: One! Yeah, Scanlan! All right, Tiberius and
Pike, you're up first. As you guys rush on the

911
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:38,476
scene, seeing this creature being currently
crushed by the semi-ethereal, giant arcane fist of

912
00:45:38,476 --> 00:45:42,769
Scanlan. Pike, Tiberius, what are you doing?

913
00:45:42,769 --> 00:45:43,979
ASHLEY: Go first.

914
00:45:43,979 --> 00:45:45,645
MARISHA: I don't want to see the giant fist of
Scanlan.

915
00:45:45,645 --> 00:45:47,042
SAM: Many have before.

916
00:45:47,042 --> 00:45:51,864
ORION: I'll follow suit, and be like: Oh, is this
what we're doing? Scanlan! What are we doing?

917
00:45:51,864 --> 00:45:55,616
SAM: We're capturing the giant, and don't remind
him I'm here.

918
00:45:55,616 --> 00:45:57,418
MARISHA: Capture!

919
00:45:57,418 --> 00:46:04,615
ORION: Oh, uh, very well. I'll Watery Sphere and
help him maintain him.

920
00:46:04,615 --> 00:46:08,018
MATT: Okay, so you're going to use your Aqua
Sphere?

921
00:46:08,018 --> 00:46:08,953
ORION: Yeah.

922
00:46:08,953 --> 00:46:11,125
MATT: All right, what is the effect on Huge
creatures?

923
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:13,872
ORION: Like, it's a dope-ass effect.

924
00:46:13,872 --> 00:46:16,477
SAM: That's what it says in the book.

925
00:46:16,477 --> 00:46:17,954
MATT: What it officially says?

926
00:46:17,954 --> 00:46:20,533
ORION: Yep. Wizards of the Coast, page 304.

927
00:46:20,533 --> 00:46:21,669
SAM: What's the spell name?

928
00:46:21,669 --> 00:46:24,465
ORION AND MATT: Watery Sphere.

929
00:46:24,465 --> 00:46:31,226
MATT: Here we go, got it right here. A Huge or
larger creature automatically succeeds on the

930
00:46:31,226 --> 00:46:32,527
saving throw.

931
00:46:32,527 --> 00:46:33,449
SAM: Oh.

932
00:46:33,449 --> 00:46:39,110
MATT: So as you create the sphere around it, the
water forms around its physical form. It doesn't

933
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:42,610
seem to be affecting it. It's large and strong
enough to the point where it's thrashing, because

934
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:44,617
he's holding it in place, but the sphere is just
having no effect.

935
00:46:44,617 --> 00:46:46,948
LIAM: He smells slightly better than he did
before.

936
00:46:46,948 --> 00:46:50,594
MATT: He does. There are cleaner portions of his
flesh. This creature's a little larger than what

937
00:46:50,594 --> 00:46:52,401
you're used to capturing with a sphere.

938
00:46:52,401 --> 00:46:55,799
ORION: What are you talking about? How big is it?

939
00:46:55,799 --> 00:46:57,096
ALL: He's Huge!

940
00:46:57,096 --> 00:46:58,174
ASHLEY: Look how big he is!

941
00:46:58,174 --> 00:46:59,422
LAURA: Look at how big he is compared to us!

942
00:46:59,422 --> 00:47:01,983
MATT: This is an ogre!

943
00:47:01,983 --> 00:47:04,734
ORION: I can capture those, but not that guy.

944
00:47:04,734 --> 00:47:06,222
LIAM: Yes, you were tickling his nipples with your
water.

945
00:47:06,222 --> 00:47:07,280
MATT: Essentially.

946
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,444
ASHLEY: He got a little bath.

947
00:47:08,444 --> 00:47:13,026
ORION: So, hold on. I knew that! I do that to wash
him off.

948
00:47:13,026 --> 00:47:14,932
LAURA: Okay, yeah. Because he's really stinky.

949
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:16,345
MATT: He's much cleaner!

950
00:47:16,345 --> 00:47:19,809
ORION: And I'm swirling around, I'm like, does
this feel good, giant?

951
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:22,964
MATT: (laughs) All right. Pike, what you got?

952
00:47:22,964 --> 00:47:27,482
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to make a Spiritual
Weapon.

953
00:47:27,482 --> 00:47:29,100
MATT: You what?

954
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,525
ASHLEY: I'm going to make a Spiritual Weapon.

955
00:47:30,525 --> 00:47:31,450
MATT: Okay.

956
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:37,229
ASHLEY: I want to make a lasso again, of sorts.
But with a grappling hook on the end. So it will

957
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,640
spin around him real quick.

958
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,690
SAM: A Lariat of Truth?

959
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:42,787
ASHLEY: And keep him in place.

960
00:47:42,787 --> 00:47:46,418
MATT: Okay, all right, so you're creating a
Spiritual Weapon. We'll say this can be considered

961
00:47:46,418 --> 00:47:47,823
just an additional grapple.

962
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:48,955
ASHLEY: Okay.

963
00:47:48,955 --> 00:47:53,489
MATT: All right. Good to know. So you create it.
I'll just use this as the Spiritual Weapon, in his

964
00:47:53,489 --> 00:47:59,931
space, currently. It begins to wrap around him
rapidly. One, two, three, four. And finds purchase

965
00:47:59,931 --> 00:48:03,041
on its own self, holding it in place. So, there we
go.

966
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:04,334
SAM: Double grapple!

967
00:48:04,334 --> 00:48:06,422
MATT: Do you want to move with your turn, or you
want to stay there?

968
00:48:06,422 --> 00:48:07,634
ASHLEY: Where am I at?

969
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:08,696
MATT: You're right here.

970
00:48:08,696 --> 00:48:11,062
ASHLEY: Okay. Yeah, I want to get a little
closer.

971
00:48:11,062 --> 00:48:13,342
LAURA: Whoa, whoa!

972
00:48:13,342 --> 00:48:14,950
ASHLEY: Just hold on a minute, I want to-- Yeah.

973
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:16,527
SAM: She's getting closer to me.

974
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:19,183
LIAM: The gnomes are like tent spikes, holding him
in place.

975
00:48:19,183 --> 00:48:24,337
MATT: As a note, real fast, guys. Let's see if we
have the--

976
00:48:24,337 --> 00:48:26,105
ORION: Currently washing his hump.

977
00:48:26,105 --> 00:48:28,337
LIAM: Oh my god, is the beholder attacking? Is it
now?

978
00:48:28,337 --> 00:48:33,191
MATT: No, I want to make sure we have the laser
pointers for you guys. Everyone forgets those.

979
00:48:33,191 --> 00:48:35,979
MARISHA: Oh, do we have more? I've got one right
here.

980
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:40,813
MATT: All right. I have one, here.

981
00:48:40,813 --> 00:48:43,105
MARISHA: Throw it to that table.

982
00:48:43,105 --> 00:48:44,699
MATT: All right, so we have two over there?

983
00:48:44,699 --> 00:48:46,215
TALIESIN: We've got one over here. Two over here.

984
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:48,105
MARISHA AND ORION: Three over here.

985
00:48:48,105 --> 00:48:50,037
MATT: All righty. Good to know. Thank you for your
patience.

986
00:48:50,037 --> 00:48:56,419
ASHLEY: Do I roll for damage or anything like
that? Or, since it's a grappling--

987
00:48:56,419 --> 00:48:59,028
MATT: For the purpose of what you want to do with
this grappling hook, it's not going to do any

988
00:48:59,028 --> 00:49:01,524
damage to him. It's just going to be an additional
grapple to him, holding him in place.

989
00:49:01,524 --> 00:49:02,737
ASHLEY: Okay.

990
00:49:02,737 --> 00:49:04,323
MATT: All right. That brings us to Grog.

991
00:49:04,323 --> 00:49:10,018
TRAVIS: I hold off on Raging. I can't talk, right?
If I'm freaking out?

992
00:49:10,018 --> 00:49:11,357
SAM: You're going to talk?

993
00:49:11,357 --> 00:49:16,855
MATT: You can talk but it comes through in single
words, and usually not in a diplomatic way.

994
00:49:16,855 --> 00:49:27,696
TRAVIS: Right. So I call out in Giant, "Nipple
Taint, Knuckle Broom!" which means, "Brother! We

995
00:49:27,696 --> 00:49:37,194
"seek to fight a great evil! Perchance, would thou
carest to join us in such a fight? I have ale."

996
00:49:37,194 --> 00:49:38,762
ASHLEY: Inspiration? Anybody can--

997
00:49:38,762 --> 00:49:40,331
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. Would you like to join us?

998
00:49:40,331 --> 00:49:42,515
MARISHA: Whose turn is next?

999
00:49:42,515 --> 00:49:45,704
MATT: Grog. Next after this is Vax.

1000
00:49:45,704 --> 00:49:47,460
SAM: You're just appealing to his reason?

1001
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,442
MARISHA: Can I go next? And help him out?

1002
00:49:49,442 --> 00:49:52,593
MATT: It's a little late for that, unfortunately.
He's ahead of you.

1003
00:49:52,593 --> 00:49:59,344
TRAVIS: We're not worth the trouble. But we would
love to pay you in ale to join us on

1004
00:49:59,344 --> 00:50:02,471
a much better fight.

1005
00:50:02,471 --> 00:50:08,608
MATT: Go ahead and make a persuasion roll with
disadvantage.

1006
00:50:08,608 --> 00:50:12,438
TRAVIS: That's pretty bad. That's the same
number.

1007
00:50:12,438 --> 00:50:15,950
(laughter)

1008
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:21,540
TRAVIS: I get a massive plus one. Five.

1009
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,964
LAURA: Oh. It worked! I think it worked!

1010
00:50:23,964 --> 00:50:31,955
MATT: So, the bound, twisted, malformed, giant
creature that's currently held by ethereal rope

1011
00:50:31,955 --> 00:50:37,606
and ethereal hand, glances over at you for a
second. And you swear, you hear a chuckle.

1012
00:50:37,606 --> 00:50:45,576
(chuckles) And spits a basketball-sized loogie
onto the ground in front of you.

1013
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:46,592
LAURA: So disgusting.

1014
00:50:46,592 --> 00:50:48,956
TRAVIS: Impressive. Fuck it. I rage!

1015
00:50:48,956 --> 00:50:51,341
(laughter)

1016
00:50:51,341 --> 00:50:52,979
TRAVIS: And I attack.

1017
00:50:52,979 --> 00:50:55,569
MATT: I would say that diplomatic attempt on him
would be your action.

1018
00:50:55,569 --> 00:50:58,021
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch. Can I rage as a bonus
action?

1019
00:50:58,021 --> 00:50:59,580
MATT: You would be raging as a bonus action.

1020
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,206
TRAVIS: (incoherent rage shouting)

1021
00:51:01,206 --> 00:51:03,791
MATT: Okay, do you want to move as well?

1022
00:51:03,791 --> 00:51:06,318
LIAM: Look how little you look, next to him.
You're so small.

1023
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:08,673
TRAVIS: I know, I'm right at testicle height.

1024
00:51:08,673 --> 00:51:10,313
LIAM: Yeah.

1025
00:51:10,313 --> 00:51:15,694
TRAVIS: Which is not good. No, I'll stay right
where I am.

1026
00:51:15,694 --> 00:51:18,056
MATT: All right. That gets us to Vax.

1027
00:51:18,056 --> 00:51:24,787
LIAM: I'm going to go stealth. And then, this
ring. This is a wall, right?

1028
00:51:24,787 --> 00:51:27,544
MATT: It's a big 15-foot wall that goes down into
this pit.

1029
00:51:27,544 --> 00:51:29,952
LIAM: So, going stealth, is that a bonus action?

1030
00:51:29,952 --> 00:51:35,801
MATT: Going stealth, for this, I would say, would
be considered part of your move. It's a

1031
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:38,386
disadvantage if you're stealthing while moving.

1032
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:44,706
LIAM: Okay. Well, I still want to do that. So I'm
going to try to scurry over the wall there,

1033
00:51:44,706 --> 00:51:46,103
and go stealth.

1034
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:50,021
MATT: Actually, for you, isn't Hide the stealth
ability that you can use as a bonus action?

1035
00:51:50,021 --> 00:51:51,708
LIAM: Yeah, it's part of the cunning actions.

1036
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:53,069
MATT: So that would be it, yes.

1037
00:51:53,069 --> 00:51:54,128
LIAM: All right.

1038
00:51:54,128 --> 00:51:55,495
MATT: It would be your bonus action to attempt to
stealth, yes.

1039
00:51:55,495 --> 00:51:57,761
LIAM: Okay, so roll to stealth, right?

1040
00:51:57,761 --> 00:51:58,791
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

1041
00:51:58,791 --> 00:52:00,959
LIAM: Come on, meteorite die. I'm using Luck,
because that was terrible.

1042
00:52:00,959 --> 00:52:02,257
That was still terrible!

1043
00:52:02,257 --> 00:52:03,285
MATT: That's two Luck points.

1044
00:52:03,285 --> 00:52:07,044
LIAM: Okay, all right. I'm not stealthed, but I
run over by--

1045
00:52:07,044 --> 00:52:09,497
MATT: What did you roll? You don't know if you're
stealthed or not.

1046
00:52:09,497 --> 00:52:14,250
LIAM: Oh. Five and a-- Oh, sorry. It was so
pitiful. 16 and--

1047
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:16,103
LAURA: That's not pitiful!

1048
00:52:16,103 --> 00:52:20,463
LIAM: It is for me. 16 and 18.

1049
00:52:20,463 --> 00:52:23,786
MATT: All right. 16 and an 18. Gotcha. All right,
cool. So we have an 18 stealth, technically.

1050
00:52:23,786 --> 00:52:25,242
(sarcastically) So pitiful.

1051
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:29,234
ASHLEY: Yeah, you want to talk pitiful for
stealth?

1052
00:52:29,234 --> 00:52:31,466
MATT: As far as you know, you may or may not be
hidden. What are you doing?

1053
00:52:31,466 --> 00:52:36,205
LIAM: All right, I want to roll over the side of
the wall, and then just move along over by

1054
00:52:36,205 --> 00:52:39,960
Scanlan. Between Scanlan and the giant, and just
hold my attack.

1055
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,790
MATT: Okay.

1056
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:44,530
LIAM: I can trigger that down the road, right?

1057
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:45,338
MATT: Yeah.

1058
00:52:45,338 --> 00:52:46,348
LIAM: Okay.

1059
00:52:46,348 --> 00:52:50,950
MATT: You wouldn't be able to wait. You'd have to
wait until next turn. You can't hold part of your

1060
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:52,128
turn, you've already taken--

1061
00:52:52,128 --> 00:52:53,770
LIAM: Then I'm going to stab him in the knee

1062
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:58,514
MATT: Okay, so are you shimmying along the side?
He's 15 feet above you. You're down 15 feet. You

1063
00:52:58,514 --> 00:53:00,234
would have to throw a dagger to hit him at this
point.

1064
00:53:00,234 --> 00:53:02,103
LIAM: All right, I'll throw it in his face.

1065
00:53:02,103 --> 00:53:08,953
MATT: Okay. Currently bound, kind of easy to see.
He's really ugly. You throw a dagger up towards

1066
00:53:08,953 --> 00:53:10,473
him with your action.

1067
00:53:10,473 --> 00:53:12,706
LIAM: All right, that's no good. And then the
bonus action is also no good.

1068
00:53:12,706 --> 00:53:14,462
MATT: You've already used your bonus action to go
stealth.

1069
00:53:14,462 --> 00:53:15,694
LIAM: Well, they're gone.

1070
00:53:15,694 --> 00:53:16,699
MATT: What'd you roll?

1071
00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:17,883
LIAM: Four and a five.

1072
00:53:17,883 --> 00:53:18,955
MATT: Plus--

1073
00:53:18,955 --> 00:53:21,621
LIAM: Plus-- I didn't sleep at all last night.

1074
00:53:21,621 --> 00:53:23,611
MATT: Tell me what your final numbers are!

1075
00:53:23,611 --> 00:53:26,096
LIAM: 12 and ten.

1076
00:53:26,096 --> 00:53:30,020
MATT: Okay, yeah. Both of those, unfortunately
miss. You fling both. Unfortunately, the process

1077
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:34,321
of jumping down and running, as you chuck it at
the end of your movement next to Scanlan, even

1078
00:53:34,321 --> 00:53:38,968
though he's bound, you're just a little off your
game. It just cascades out of sight and then

1079
00:53:38,968 --> 00:53:43,961
vanishes, appearing back on your belt. That brings
us to Percy and Keyleth.

1080
00:53:43,961 --> 00:53:47,183
TALIESIN: I'll go first. Okay, I'm going to--
Where am I?

1081
00:53:47,183 --> 00:53:48,711
MATT: You're over here.

1082
00:53:48,711 --> 00:53:55,356
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to scoot in over here
and make my way. And as I'm running by, I'm going

1083
00:53:55,356 --> 00:53:58,954
to take a shot at his kneecap and see if I can
prone him.

1084
00:53:58,954 --> 00:54:00,017
MATT: Okay.

1085
00:54:00,017 --> 00:54:01,287
ASHLEY: Come on, Bad News.

1086
00:54:01,287 --> 00:54:02,538
MARISHA: Are we still trying to capture him?

1087
00:54:02,538 --> 00:54:03,877
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm just going to knock him down.

1088
00:54:03,877 --> 00:54:05,608
LAURA: I think we're trying.

1089
00:54:05,608 --> 00:54:08,251
ORION: You can do non-lethal damage to him.

1090
00:54:08,251 --> 00:54:09,186
TALIESIN: 20?

1091
00:54:09,186 --> 00:54:10,586
MATT: 20 hits.

1092
00:54:10,586 --> 00:54:11,551
TALIESIN: 20 hits.

1093
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:13,112
ASHLEY: And he's grappled?

1094
00:54:13,112 --> 00:54:14,192
SAM: Twice.

1095
00:54:14,192 --> 00:54:17,748
TALIESIN: He's grappled and he's now prone. But
I'm going to do my 1d10 damage.

1096
00:54:17,748 --> 00:54:21,045
ASHLEY: He's double grappled. Shit, I forgot that
he was already grappled.

1097
00:54:21,045 --> 00:54:22,215
TRAVIS: Can I try to talk to him?

1098
00:54:22,215 --> 00:54:24,031
TALIESIN: That's 15 damage.

1099
00:54:24,031 --> 00:54:25,303
MATT: Okay.

1100
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:26,777
TALIESIN: He takes 15 damage and he's prone.

1101
00:54:26,777 --> 00:54:29,069
LIAM: Sweet.

1102
00:54:29,069 --> 00:54:31,727
MATT: "Arrgh!" (heavy impact)

1103
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:33,249
SAM: Don't fall on me!

1104
00:54:33,249 --> 00:54:35,358
TALIESIN: And I'm going to finish scooting down
there.

1105
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:42,133
MATT: I will-- (laughs) Okay, so, as you shoot off
the kneecap, he tumbles forward.

1106
00:54:42,133 --> 00:54:44,091
LAURA: Oh no!

1107
00:54:44,091 --> 00:54:49,645
MATT: Over the edge. This way. Both of you guys
make dexterity saving throws.

1108
00:54:49,645 --> 00:54:51,693
TALIESIN: We can't win!

1109
00:54:51,693 --> 00:54:53,267
ASHLEY: Wait, that's a cliff?

1110
00:54:53,267 --> 00:54:55,803
LAURA: That's an edge, with a 15-foot drop.

1111
00:54:55,803 --> 00:54:57,663
MATT: It's a 50-50 shot on which side he fell.

1112
00:54:57,663 --> 00:54:58,670
SAM: Where's my dice?

1113
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,957
TALIESIN: I spent a Grit point for that.

1114
00:54:59,957 --> 00:55:01,044
SAM: Where's my 20?

1115
00:55:01,044 --> 00:55:02,272
TALIESIN: Here.

1116
00:55:02,272 --> 00:55:03,237
SAM: Oh, here it is.

1117
00:55:03,237 --> 00:55:04,470
ASHLEY: 15, or five-zero?

1118
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:05,422
LAURA: 15.

1119
00:55:05,422 --> 00:55:06,470
LIAM: 19.

1120
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:07,543
SAM: Plus what?

1121
00:55:07,543 --> 00:55:09,070
MATT: Your dexterity saving throw.

1122
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:09,955
SAM: 17.

1123
00:55:09,955 --> 00:55:10,878
MATT: 17.

1124
00:55:10,878 --> 00:55:15,171
MATT: You both manage to just leap out of the way.
Slamming onto his back on the ground.

1125
00:55:15,171 --> 00:55:17,885
SAM: Do we get free attacks on him?

1126
00:55:17,885 --> 00:55:19,251
(laughter)

1127
00:55:19,251 --> 00:55:22,175
MATT: No, but you're nearly crushed by an
extremely large person.

1128
00:55:22,175 --> 00:55:23,676
SAM: I'll take it. That's a plus, that's a
positive.

1129
00:55:23,676 --> 00:55:26,107
MATT: All right, Percy, does that end your turn?

1130
00:55:26,107 --> 00:55:29,721
TALIESIN: I'm not doing anything else for this
turn. That went poorly.

1131
00:55:29,721 --> 00:55:30,888
MATT: Okay, Keyleth.

1132
00:55:30,888 --> 00:55:43,338
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to-- Can I move, can I
get to him?

1133
00:55:43,338 --> 00:55:49,119
MATT: He's 15 feet down. You can move up to the
edge, here. Look down and see him on the ground,

1134
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,262
currently restrained and struggling on his back.

1135
00:55:52,262 --> 00:55:59,874
MARISHA: If I turn into a snake, can I get down
there? Big snake?

1136
00:55:59,874 --> 00:56:01,535
(laughter)

1137
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,173
MATT: I'd say you would be able to.

1138
00:56:03,173 --> 00:56:06,595
MARISHA: I want to turn into a giant constrictor.

1139
00:56:06,595 --> 00:56:08,016
MATT: Okay.

1140
00:56:08,016 --> 00:56:11,318
LAURA: You're going to constrict him?

1141
00:56:11,318 --> 00:56:15,436
MARISHA: Real big snake! Yeah, I'm going to
constrict him.

1142
00:56:15,436 --> 00:56:18,509
MATT: (sings) I'll use this naga figure for that.

1143
00:56:18,509 --> 00:56:19,900
ALL: Ooh.

1144
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,193
LAURA: That's big.

1145
00:56:21,193 --> 00:56:22,626
MARISHA: I'm a naga!

1146
00:56:22,626 --> 00:56:24,763
SAM: We are grappling the hell out of him.

1147
00:56:24,763 --> 00:56:26,353
MARISHA: I'm so pretty.

1148
00:56:26,353 --> 00:56:28,468
MATT: Leap down? And you're trying to grapple
him?

1149
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,219
MARISHA: And I'm going to start constricting.

1150
00:56:30,219 --> 00:56:32,976
SAM: Grog, you might have to talk to him again.

1151
00:56:32,976 --> 00:56:35,462
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll a d20.

1152
00:56:35,462 --> 00:56:37,198
TRAVIS: I don't know if I can.

1153
00:56:37,198 --> 00:56:39,692
MATT: What's the strength bonus of the form?

1154
00:56:39,692 --> 00:56:42,272
MARISHA: I get a plus six. Oh wait.

1155
00:56:42,272 --> 00:56:44,865
MATT: What's it say for the constricting? It
should have the rule there for it.

1156
00:56:44,865 --> 00:56:49,191
MARISHA: It's a strength--

1157
00:56:49,191 --> 00:56:51,950
MATT: All right, so you add six to that.

1158
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:57,050
MARISHA: -- bonus, I guess. So 14.

1159
00:56:57,050 --> 00:57:01,257
MATT: Okay. You start moving around and even
though he's still struggling in his form, he gets

1160
00:57:01,257 --> 00:57:05,572
one hand up and is holding you at bay. You have
not managed to grapple him yet, but you are in the

1161
00:57:05,572 --> 00:57:09,950
process of trying to. Next round you can try
again. He's pretty strong.

1162
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:12,362
LIAM: When are you clever folk going to get in his
head?

1163
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:13,432
MATT: Vex.

1164
00:57:13,432 --> 00:57:14,366
LAURA: That's me.

1165
00:57:14,366 --> 00:57:15,314
MATT: Yep.

1166
00:57:15,314 --> 00:57:23,357
LAURA: I am going to-- Has he taken a lot of
damage yet, or are we just keep grappling him?

1167
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:26,614
MATT: He looks-- There's been a lot of grappling
this past round. He took a lot of damage before

1168
00:57:26,614 --> 00:57:28,830
everyone else showed up and it's been just a lot
of holding him.

1169
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:31,876
LAURA: All right, I'm going to attack him, twice.
The second time with a--

1170
00:57:31,876 --> 00:57:33,520
MATT: You can't see him right now, because he's
fallen.

1171
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,005
LAURA: I'm going to scootch up there so I can.

1172
00:57:35,005 --> 00:57:37,345
MATT: All right.

1173
00:57:37,345 --> 00:57:38,526
SAM: Just hold him.

1174
00:57:38,526 --> 00:57:40,125
MATT: And now you see him on the ground.

1175
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:41,852
LAURA: And I'm going to take two shots at him.

1176
00:57:41,852 --> 00:57:47,546
MATT: All right. Both of these shots are at
disadvantage, because there's Keyleth currently

1177
00:57:47,546 --> 00:57:49,402
trying to wrap around him as a giant snake.

1178
00:57:49,402 --> 00:57:56,553
LAURA: All right.

1179
00:57:56,553 --> 00:57:58,188
TRAVIS: She'll be fine!

1180
00:57:58,188 --> 00:58:00,357
MARISHA: I thought we were trying to capture him.

1181
00:58:00,357 --> 00:58:02,805
ORION: We are. She can knock him out, though.

1182
00:58:02,805 --> 00:58:04,675
MATT: So just each attack with disadvantage.

1183
00:58:04,675 --> 00:58:05,945
TRAVIS: Just roll really high both times.

1184
00:58:05,945 --> 00:58:06,712
LIAM: Wow!

1185
00:58:06,712 --> 00:58:09,199
LAURA: 24, 26!

1186
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:10,441
MATT: That hits. Second attack.

1187
00:58:10,441 --> 00:58:13,634
LAURA: Second attack is a Sleep arrow.

1188
00:58:13,634 --> 00:58:15,251
MATT: Secondary Sleep arrow.

1189
00:58:15,251 --> 00:58:16,191
LAURA: Yeah.

1190
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,116
MATT: All right.

1191
00:58:17,116 --> 00:58:18,044
MARISHA: Go to sleep!

1192
00:58:18,044 --> 00:58:19,917
MATT: Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep!

1193
00:58:19,917 --> 00:58:21,116
LAURA: 17.

1194
00:58:21,116 --> 00:58:25,110
MATT: 17 also hits. All right, so go ahead and
roll damage on the first arrow, with your Hunter's

1195
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:26,134
Mark damage.

1196
00:58:26,134 --> 00:58:30,869
LAURA: Yes. 15, 16, 17, 20?

1197
00:58:30,869 --> 00:58:32,112
MATT: All right.

1198
00:58:32,112 --> 00:58:34,136
LAURA: And then the second one--

1199
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,291
TRAVIS: You're putting the hurt on him.

1200
00:58:35,291 --> 00:58:42,125
LAURA: That's ten, 11, 12. 16 on the second hit.

1201
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:44,353
MATT: 16, okay. And then go ahead and roll 5d8 for
the Sleep arrow.

1202
00:58:44,353 --> 00:58:45,734
LAURA: Oh, right, I only get 5d8.

1203
00:58:45,734 --> 00:58:47,177
MATT: Yeah, wasn't a critical hit, sorry.

1204
00:58:47,177 --> 00:58:59,805
LAURA: Oh. Okay. Look at all these dice I have!
14, 20, 22?

1205
00:58:59,805 --> 00:59:07,093
MATT: 22? As the arrow sinks into him, you see him
struggling against both the snake form and Bigby's

1206
00:59:07,093 --> 00:59:12,793
Grasping Hand. As it struggles and throws about,
the grappling hook tightens on its form--

1207
00:59:12,793 --> 00:59:16,557
TRAVIS: Oh, oh!

1208
00:59:16,557 --> 00:59:17,565
LAURA: Yes!

1209
00:59:17,565 --> 00:59:18,616
TRAVIS and LAURA: Sleep!

1210
00:59:18,616 --> 00:59:20,771
(cheering)

1211
00:59:20,771 --> 00:59:22,096
SAM: How did you do it?

1212
00:59:22,096 --> 00:59:23,403
ASHLEY: She has a Sleep arrow.

1213
00:59:23,403 --> 00:59:24,358
SAM: You had another one?

1214
00:59:24,358 --> 00:59:25,509
LAURA: Yeah, I have three.

1215
00:59:25,509 --> 00:59:26,892
MATT: Now she has one.

1216
00:59:26,892 --> 00:59:28,024
LAURA: Now I have one!

1217
00:59:28,024 --> 00:59:29,046
SAM: (whispers) Okay, he's asleep.

1218
00:59:29,046 --> 00:59:30,741
SAM: (whispers) Shh, everyone whisper.

1219
00:59:30,741 --> 00:59:31,914
TRAVIS: (normal volume) What?

1220
00:59:31,914 --> 00:59:33,095
LAURA: Shh.

1221
00:59:33,095 --> 00:59:34,568
LIAM: (whispers) Rock him, Keyleth. Rock him.

1222
00:59:34,568 --> 00:59:36,292
LAURA: No, don't wake him up. Don't rock him.

1223
00:59:36,292 --> 00:59:40,550
MATT: So, for the moment, combat is paused. You
guys do what you need to, but be aware that every

1224
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,344
period of time, he's going to be making saving
throws.

1225
00:59:42,344 --> 00:59:44,356
SAM: Okay, we have a mind flayer.

1226
00:59:44,356 --> 00:59:47,874
LAURA: Oh, Clarota, can you Dominate him?

1227
00:59:47,874 --> 00:59:49,675
SAM: Yeah, Clarota is a mind flayer, it's his
bag.

1228
00:59:49,675 --> 01:00:05,426
MATT: Clarota steps forward and goes, "I can, for
a short period of time, or I could just take its mind."

1229
01:00:05,426 --> 01:00:06,590
LAURA: Okay, yeah.

1230
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:09,111
(sounds of protest)

1231
01:00:09,111 --> 01:00:11,606
ORION: You mean for a snack, though, you're
saying.

1232
01:00:11,606 --> 01:00:16,988
MATT: "I would then have its memories and
knowledge at my disposal."

1233
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,873
LAURA: But you can't control its body?

1234
01:00:18,873 --> 01:00:21,717
ORION: We need more of his brutish, tank-ish
strength.

1235
01:00:21,717 --> 01:00:23,166
TRAVIS: What was your thing?

1236
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:24,980
ASHLEY: Wait, so short time means what?

1237
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:30,418
MATT: "Until it resists the influence."

1238
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,046
SAM: Until it resists, that's no good.

1239
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:33,335
LIAM: That's very temporary.

1240
01:00:33,335 --> 01:00:35,637
ORION: Could you perhaps put him to sleep for the
evening?

1241
01:00:35,637 --> 01:00:40,617
MARISHA: Or can we figure out a way to restrain
him?

1242
01:00:40,617 --> 01:00:41,984
SAM: We need to rest.

1243
01:00:41,984 --> 01:00:44,258
LAURA: Yeah, can we quickly tie him down while
we're talking?

1244
01:00:44,258 --> 01:00:48,885
MARISHA: Because here's the thing, I have an
ability where I can use Geas. And cast Geas on

1245
01:00:48,885 --> 01:00:53,863
him, and I basically give him a command and he'll
essentially become our big--

1246
01:00:53,863 --> 01:00:55,117
SAM: And it lasts for 30 days.

1247
01:00:55,117 --> 01:00:56,982
MARISHA: He'll be our big, beefy minion for 30
days.

1248
01:00:56,982 --> 01:00:57,914
LAURA: Oh, yeah!

1249
01:00:57,914 --> 01:01:00,309
MARISHA: And if he resists it, he takes psychic
damage.

1250
01:01:00,309 --> 01:01:02,816
TRAVIS: We have have manacles, and we have
chains.

1251
01:01:02,816 --> 01:01:04,627
SAM: Put him in the Bag of Holding!

1252
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:07,691
LAURA: Let's frickin' tie him down. At least can
we tie him up right now?

1253
01:01:07,691 --> 01:01:12,354
ORION: We'll secure him, but Clarota, could you
prolong the Sleep spell for eight hours so we can

1254
01:01:12,354 --> 01:01:14,105
rest and you could do your spell?

1255
01:01:14,105 --> 01:01:22,845
MATT: "For eight hours, no. Nothing in my
repertoire lasts that long, which is why I say let

1256
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:25,296
"me take his mind."

1257
01:01:25,296 --> 01:01:26,225
MARISHA: No.

1258
01:01:26,225 --> 01:01:27,848
TRAVIS: I don't wanna!

1259
01:01:27,848 --> 01:01:31,839
LAURA: It's a big ol' feast, I know, I know. It's
a lot of food for you.

1260
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:33,869
MATT: "I'm hungry."

1261
01:01:33,869 --> 01:01:36,715
MARISHA: You had a snack not that long ago.

1262
01:01:36,715 --> 01:01:40,008
ORION: I hand him some jerky. It's really
delicious.

1263
01:01:40,008 --> 01:01:45,778
LAURA: Clarota, what about the thing he was
carrying? Can you eat that thing's brain?

1264
01:01:45,778 --> 01:01:47,834
SAM: Don't worry about his dinner right now.

1265
01:01:47,834 --> 01:01:49,457
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, what was he dragging? Wasn't
there a corpse?

1266
01:01:49,457 --> 01:01:52,035
SAM: Let's figure out how we're going to control
it.

1267
01:01:52,035 --> 01:01:53,308
TRAVIS: I don't think we can.

1268
01:01:53,308 --> 01:01:55,289
SAM: Okay, let's manacle it. Let's at least try to
hold it.

1269
01:01:55,289 --> 01:01:56,544
LAURA: Chain it up.

1270
01:01:56,544 --> 01:01:57,634
SAM: Chain it up.

1271
01:01:57,634 --> 01:01:59,756
TRAVIS: Can you make the manacles big? Can you
Engorge the--

1272
01:01:59,756 --> 01:02:05,366
MATT: The creature begins to flutter its eyes for
a second. Clarota immediately looks down and puts

1273
01:02:05,366 --> 01:02:09,689
his hand out and releases a force of arcane
sparkles that cover its body,

1274
01:02:09,689 --> 01:02:12,734
and it falls back asleep.

1275
01:02:12,734 --> 01:02:14,992
TRAVIS: Can you make the manacles bigger?
Giant-sized?

1276
01:02:14,992 --> 01:02:18,724
SAM: No, they're inorganic. I can't do anything to
those.

1277
01:02:18,724 --> 01:02:20,747
LAURA: Can we just use chain and tie him up?

1278
01:02:20,747 --> 01:02:22,606
TRAVIS: Like Harry Potter! Engorgio! No?

1279
01:02:22,606 --> 01:02:23,719
ORION: Engorgio?

1280
01:02:23,719 --> 01:02:24,743
TRAVIS: Fuck!

1281
01:02:24,743 --> 01:02:25,872
TALIESIN: Do we have chain?

1282
01:02:25,872 --> 01:02:27,207
LAURA: We have chain. Grog has chain.

1283
01:02:27,207 --> 01:02:28,370
TALIESIN: Let's chain him up.

1284
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:29,474
LAURA: We chain him up!

1285
01:02:29,474 --> 01:02:32,286
SAM: I have poison. I have drow poison from a
previous adventure.

1286
01:02:32,286 --> 01:02:35,583
That's a knockout drug, isn't it?

1287
01:02:35,583 --> 01:02:37,616
MATT: You don't know much about drow poison.

1288
01:02:37,616 --> 01:02:38,679
SAM: Damn it!

1289
01:02:38,679 --> 01:02:40,627
MATT: Go ahead and make a nature roll.

1290
01:02:40,627 --> 01:02:44,137
LAURA: Percy and I chain him up. We use the chains
that we have.

1291
01:02:44,137 --> 01:02:45,264
SAM: 20.

1292
01:02:45,264 --> 01:02:52,002
MATT: 20? You know that drow poison, for the most
part, would not facilitate keeping something alive.

1293
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:55,271
ORION: Right, it is poisonous.

1294
01:02:55,271 --> 01:03:01,811
LIAM: While everybody's discussing, Vax is going
to walk down to the center of the pit to take a

1295
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:03,206
peek at that hole.

1296
01:03:03,206 --> 01:03:08,163
MATT: Okay. You go ahead and glance over the top.
It drops down about 20 feet in what looks to be a

1297
01:03:08,163 --> 01:03:13,985
series of long rusted-over, metallic spikes.
Whatever this pit was previously used for was

1298
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:18,171
almost like a gladiatorial experience. You can see
what looks like some clusters of old, ancient

1299
01:03:18,171 --> 01:03:21,869
bones at the bottom. Mostly seen disuse for
hundreds of years.

1300
01:03:21,869 --> 01:03:26,070
TRAVIS: We should drag him over there, just in
case he wakes up. Kick him in.

1301
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:29,488
ORION: It's fine. If he did something, we'd kill
him.

1302
01:03:29,488 --> 01:03:31,280
MATT: So what are you guys doing?

1303
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,272
SAM: You don't have the spell, right?

1304
01:03:33,272 --> 01:03:40,706
MARISHA: Can I take time, if we grapple him and I
take a rest, essentially, almost take a 20 to cast

1305
01:03:40,706 --> 01:03:41,919
Geas on him?

1306
01:03:41,919 --> 01:03:45,199
MATT: How long does Geas take to cast?

1307
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:46,877
ORION: It's a minute to cast.

1308
01:03:46,877 --> 01:03:48,088
MARISHA: Generally takes a minute to cast.

1309
01:03:48,088 --> 01:03:49,525
MATT: Okay.

1310
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:50,601
MARISHA: Can I do that?

1311
01:03:50,601 --> 01:03:53,496
MATT: You can certainly try. We'll see how long
you guys can keep him restrained.

1312
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:54,585
TALIESIN: We have chained him.

1313
01:03:54,585 --> 01:03:55,658
LAURA: We have chained him.

1314
01:03:55,658 --> 01:03:56,631
MATT: Right.

1315
01:03:56,631 --> 01:03:58,018
SAM: With our puny chains.

1316
01:03:58,018 --> 01:04:01,873
MATT: As you guys are getting the chains around
him, he maintains his slumber. You guys continue

1317
01:04:01,873 --> 01:04:05,659
to bring the chains around. It's a big body and
there's a lot to get around. How much chain do you

1318
01:04:05,659 --> 01:04:07,452
guys have total, by the way, length-wise?

1319
01:04:07,452 --> 01:04:08,498
TRAVIS: It's 150 feet.

1320
01:04:08,498 --> 01:04:09,773
MATT: 150 feet of chain.

1321
01:04:09,773 --> 01:04:11,392
SAM: We also have our never-ending rope, don't
we?

1322
01:04:11,392 --> 01:04:15,019
LAURA: I know, we do have some more never-ending
rope. And we can keep using that. A lot of it.

1323
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:17,154
TALIESIN: Never-ending rope doesn't grow on trees,
though.

1324
01:04:17,154 --> 01:04:20,869
MATT: Okay. You get the chain-- full length of
chain around his torso area. You start getting it

1325
01:04:20,869 --> 01:04:24,027
around his legs, you start pulling the rope
around. He begins to wake up once again. He begins

1326
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:25,132
to thrash about.

1327
01:04:25,132 --> 01:04:26,420
LAURA: No, no, no.

1328
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:32,774
MATT: He rolls a two to break against the chain.
He's currently still grappled. Clarota releases

1329
01:04:32,774 --> 01:04:34,709
another Sleep spell.

1330
01:04:34,709 --> 01:04:40,269
TRAVIS: Should we put a fancy robe over his nasty
eye, so he can't give you the--

1331
01:04:40,269 --> 01:04:41,340
LAURA: Yeah, let's do it.

1332
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,510
SAM: Sure, yeah, why not?

1333
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:47,268
TRAVIS: We have eight fancy robes. I take one of
them and I put it over his nasty pirate eye.

1334
01:04:47,268 --> 01:04:52,023
MATT: Okay. You take one of your eight fancy robes
you had kicking in the Bag of Holding.

1335
01:04:52,023 --> 01:04:56,682
TRAVIS: They were in the closet, nobody wanted
them! But now they're coming to use, so suck it up.

1336
01:04:56,682 --> 01:04:58,193
ORION: Let me sleep, hold on.

1337
01:04:58,193 --> 01:05:02,863
MATT: It is probably the nicest thing this
creature has ever worn. Just keep that in mind.

1338
01:05:02,863 --> 01:05:04,930
LIAM: There's a pair of pants hanging off his
eye.

1339
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:10,431
MATT: You finish restraining him with the chains.
Who's doing what?

1340
01:05:10,431 --> 01:05:12,077
SAM: She's just casting, right?

1341
01:05:12,077 --> 01:05:13,514
MARISHA: I guess you can help me out?

1342
01:05:13,514 --> 01:05:15,335
SAM: I'm going to inspire her, somehow.

1343
01:05:15,335 --> 01:05:17,942
ORION: I'm going to encourage success.

1344
01:05:17,942 --> 01:05:21,269
SAM: I'm going to inspire her with a song.

1345
01:05:21,269 --> 01:05:24,017
LIAM: I'm going to see if I see anything more than
just spikes down in the hole.

1346
01:05:24,017 --> 01:05:25,339
MATT: Perception check.

1347
01:05:25,339 --> 01:05:29,305
LAURA: Keyleth-- Oh, never mind. Can anybody make
it look like there's a big feast in front of him?

1348
01:05:29,305 --> 01:05:30,503
LIAM: 24.

1349
01:05:30,503 --> 01:05:35,951
MATT: 24? You do see what looks like some sort of
mild glimmer of metal that amongst all the rest of

1350
01:05:35,951 --> 01:05:40,237
the weapons and armor that have been destroyed
down there, one seems to have resisted the age,

1351
01:05:40,237 --> 01:05:41,700
that has stayed.

1352
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:45,280
LIAM: I have a plain old 50-foot rope. I'm going
to try to tie it to something on the edge.

1353
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:49,259
MATT: There is nothing to find purchase for, here.
It's just a pit.

1354
01:05:49,259 --> 01:05:51,241
LAURA: Let's do it!

1355
01:05:51,241 --> 01:05:54,781
TRAVIS: While they're chaining him up and
everything, I'd like to walk up and put my great

1356
01:05:54,781 --> 01:05:59,518
axe just under his chin. Just as a reminder.

1357
01:05:59,518 --> 01:06:01,433
MATT: Okay. Keyleth, you're casting?

1358
01:06:01,433 --> 01:06:02,674
MARISHA: I'm going for it.

1359
01:06:02,674 --> 01:06:03,860
MATT: All right, so we'll say--

1360
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:06,361
MARISHA: He has to succeed on a wisdom saving
throw against me.

1361
01:06:06,361 --> 01:06:08,006
MATT: We'll get there. It takes you a full minute
to cast it.

1362
01:06:08,006 --> 01:06:09,052
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

1363
01:06:09,052 --> 01:06:11,076
MATT: Every round he gets to resist the Sleep
spell.

1364
01:06:11,076 --> 01:06:13,611
LIAM: (whispers) Percy! Could you give me a hand
over here?

1365
01:06:13,611 --> 01:06:14,853
TALIESIN: Sure, all right.

1366
01:06:14,853 --> 01:06:16,531
LAURA: (whispers) What are you doing?

1367
01:06:16,531 --> 01:06:19,730
LIAM: (whispers) There's something down in this
hole. Do you think you could hold on to this

1368
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:21,069
tightly while I climb down?

1369
01:06:21,069 --> 01:06:22,426
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I've got it. I've got it.

1370
01:06:22,426 --> 01:06:23,647
TRAVIS: Classic line.

1371
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:24,460
LIAM: All right.

1372
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:28,778
MATT: Actually, no. This spell just puts them
straight to sleep. So, this spell, he is asleep

1373
01:06:28,778 --> 01:06:32,259
for the duration. You finish your Geas spell.

1374
01:06:32,259 --> 01:06:33,920
LIAM: It worked on you.

1375
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,643
TRAVIS: They all work on me.

1376
01:06:35,643 --> 01:06:39,941
MATT: All righty.

1377
01:06:39,941 --> 01:06:45,402
TRAVIS: There's nothing in there. I keep drinking
out of it. There's nothing in it!

1378
01:06:45,613 --> 01:06:48,838
LIAM: (whispers) Grog, there's a diamond up my
butt.

1379
01:06:48,838 --> 01:07:02,059
MATT: All right, so we have Geas. So it has to
make a wisdom saving throw. So what is the DC?

1380
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:06,586
Spell DC.

1381
01:07:06,586 --> 01:07:08,212
ORION: Yeah, stop posing for just a second.

1382
01:07:08,212 --> 01:07:09,979
SAM: Spellcasting DC.

1383
01:07:09,979 --> 01:07:13,258
MARISHA: What, it's wisdom. Oh, against my spell
save?

1384
01:07:13,258 --> 01:07:14,045
MATT: Yes.

1385
01:07:14,045 --> 01:07:15,161
SAM: What's your DC?

1386
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:16,520
MARISHA: 18.

1387
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:23,163
MATT: 18, all right. As the Sleep spell wears off,
his eyes begin to flicker and you see the strength

1388
01:07:23,163 --> 01:07:32,545
flexing in his muscle form. As you hold the axe
there, his one slashed but, you know, not bleeding

1389
01:07:32,545 --> 01:07:37,524
in this moment, eye. It seems that a lot of the
fancy robe has absorbed whatever was oozing from it.

1390
01:07:37,615 --> 01:07:38,689
TRAVIS: Right.

1391
01:07:38,689 --> 01:07:40,138
TALIESIN: Very absorbent fancy robe.

1392
01:07:40,138 --> 01:07:50,284
MATT: He glances down at you. In this horrible,
guttural series of phrases and consonants

1393
01:07:50,284 --> 01:07:53,806
(speaks Undercommon).

1394
01:07:53,806 --> 01:07:54,666
SAM: What's he saying?

1395
01:07:54,666 --> 01:07:56,008
MATT: Anyone speak Undercommon?

1396
01:07:56,008 --> 01:07:56,841
LAURA: I do.

1397
01:07:56,841 --> 01:07:57,833
ASHLEY: I do.

1398
01:07:57,833 --> 01:07:58,699
SAM: Oh, it's not Giant.

1399
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:00,282
MATT: The two of you--

1400
01:08:00,282 --> 01:08:03,817
TRAVIS: I speak two languages!

1401
01:08:03,817 --> 01:08:05,005
MATT: You do.

1402
01:08:05,005 --> 01:08:06,432
ASHLEY: You speak Undercommon?

1403
01:08:06,432 --> 01:08:08,121
TRAVIS: No, but not, no.

1404
01:08:08,121 --> 01:08:13,387
MATT: He says, essentially, "What have you done?
What do you need?"

1405
01:08:13,387 --> 01:08:23,183
LAURA: I speak back to him. And say, "K'Varn. For
him, or against him?"

1406
01:08:23,183 --> 01:08:24,720
TRAVIS: No, good, yeah.

1407
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,107
MARISHA: It's like a political rally?

1408
01:08:26,107 --> 01:08:28,269
MATT: Its eye, slowly, tweaks over back towards
Keyleth.

1409
01:08:28,269 --> 01:08:29,544
SAM: She's the one.

1410
01:08:29,544 --> 01:08:31,452
MATT: "What do you ask of me?"

1411
01:08:31,452 --> 01:08:33,477
LAURA: Oh, got it.

1412
01:08:33,477 --> 01:08:43,520
MARISHA: Follow our orders. Help us fight K'Varn.
Vex, how do you say, "Follow our orders," in

1413
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,550
Underdark?

1414
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:47,375
LAURA: Oh, it's, (gibberish).

1415
01:08:47,375 --> 01:08:51,120
SAM: The accent is on the 'kh'.

1416
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,567
LAURA: Be all like, 'kh'.

1417
01:08:52,567 --> 01:08:55,248
TRAVIS: Yeah, you got it. Back of the throat.

1418
01:08:55,248 --> 01:08:57,341
MARISHA: (gibberish)

1419
01:08:57,341 --> 01:08:59,019
LAURA: Yes, yes. Very good.

1420
01:08:59,019 --> 01:09:01,936
MATT: The giant takes a moment, and his head nods
slowly, like--

1421
01:09:01,936 --> 01:09:03,384
SAM: Is it like a French person?

1422
01:09:03,384 --> 01:09:04,183
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

1423
01:09:04,183 --> 01:09:05,421
(laughter)

1424
01:09:05,421 --> 01:09:07,486
MATT: Manages to get the gist across.

1425
01:09:07,486 --> 01:09:13,708
SAM: (French accent) I don't know what you're
saying. Oh, 'unh'! Oh, I understand now.

1426
01:09:13,708 --> 01:09:16,236
MARISHA: How do I say 'kill'?

1427
01:09:16,236 --> 01:09:18,854
LAURA: (retching noise)

1428
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:24,715
MARISHA: I look at him and I go (retching noise)
K'Varn!

1429
01:09:24,715 --> 01:09:26,113
TALIESIN: That accent was terrible.

1430
01:09:26,113 --> 01:09:29,927
MARISHA: Shut up, Percy. I'm not from here,
clearly.

1431
01:09:29,927 --> 01:09:31,737
TALIESIN: Everyone knows that, now.

1432
01:09:31,737 --> 01:09:34,647
MATT: All right.

1433
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:38,976
MARISHA: (retching noise) K'Varn.

1434
01:09:38,976 --> 01:09:43,355
MATT: He looks down at the chains and looks
expectantly at you.

1435
01:09:43,355 --> 01:09:44,968
MARISHA: Follow our orders.

1436
01:09:44,968 --> 01:09:46,405
LAURA: Hmm? Oh.

1437
01:09:46,405 --> 01:09:47,973
ORION: Take the chains off.

1438
01:09:47,973 --> 01:09:49,055
LAURA: Should we take the chains off?

1439
01:09:49,055 --> 01:09:50,481
ORION: I believe we should take the chains off.

1440
01:09:50,481 --> 01:09:52,379
LAURA: Make him agree, first.

1441
01:09:52,379 --> 01:09:54,484
MATT: He seems to be in agreement.

1442
01:09:54,484 --> 01:09:56,252
LAURA: Okay, cool.

1443
01:09:56,252 --> 01:09:57,346
MATT: Best you can tell.

1444
01:09:57,346 --> 01:10:00,030
MARISHA: You roll with us.

1445
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:01,498
LAURA: I start taking the chains off.

1446
01:10:01,498 --> 01:10:02,799
MARISHA: You our posse now.

1447
01:10:02,799 --> 01:10:04,609
LAURA: Very carefully, taking the chains off.

1448
01:10:04,609 --> 01:10:07,374
MATT: You get the chains off and as each hand is
free, he (grunts) shakes it free.

1449
01:10:07,374 --> 01:10:08,556
LAURA: Oh, okay.

1450
01:10:08,556 --> 01:10:10,844
MATT: All you kind of jump back for a second and
places it on the ground and stands up to his full

1451
01:10:10,844 --> 01:10:17,600
height around you. I'll assume that you're no
longer a naga as you cast a spell. Eventually, he

1452
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:24,072
gets to his full height and stands there looking
down at all of you. Kind of glancing around, grabs

1453
01:10:24,072 --> 01:10:31,466
the large, hardened piece of wood and stone that
he's fashioned this club out of and glances and

1454
01:10:31,466 --> 01:10:37,492
says to you. You translate for her. "Where?"

1455
01:10:37,492 --> 01:10:39,672
SAM: Where.

1456
01:10:39,672 --> 01:10:40,817
TRAVIS: A man of few words.

1457
01:10:40,817 --> 01:10:43,031
LAURA: He wants to know where.

1458
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:44,834
ORION: I saunter up. Hello.

1459
01:10:44,834 --> 01:10:46,409
TRAVIS: Christ.

1460
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:50,177
ORION: I'm really impressed. Are you our friend,
now?

1461
01:10:50,177 --> 01:10:52,057
LAURA: Tiberius, do you speak Underdark?

1462
01:10:52,057 --> 01:10:56,382
MARISHA: I don't think he can understand you.
There's a translation barrier going on.

1463
01:10:56,382 --> 01:11:01,030
ORION: Oh, well, wonderful! Tell him to follow our
orders. That's all he needs to know for now.

1464
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:02,526
MARISHA: I already told him that.

1465
01:11:02,526 --> 01:11:03,443
ORION: Oh, good!

1466
01:11:03,443 --> 01:11:05,149
MARISHA: He's in our posse.

1467
01:11:05,149 --> 01:11:07,216
SAM: He's asking where. We should tell him.

1468
01:11:07,216 --> 01:11:08,130
TRAVIS: Temple.

1469
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:09,958
LAURA: But tell him to stay for now.

1470
01:11:09,958 --> 01:11:14,419
MARISHA: Well, you, here, for now.

1471
01:11:14,419 --> 01:11:15,669
SAM: She's going to translate.

1472
01:11:15,669 --> 01:11:19,895
MARISHA: You. We roll together.

1473
01:11:19,895 --> 01:11:21,405
TRAVIS: (laughs) Jesus!

1474
01:11:21,405 --> 01:11:23,673
(laughter)

1475
01:11:23,673 --> 01:11:28,092
SAM: Go ahead and translate that.

1476
01:11:28,092 --> 01:11:31,179
ORION: Vex, you got that? Could you translate
that?

1477
01:11:31,179 --> 01:11:33,533
TRAVIS: I didn't even understand what-- (laughs)

1478
01:11:33,533 --> 01:11:36,880
LAURA: Pike, do you want to tell him what she
said?

1479
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,244
MARISHA: I'm trying to say we roll deep.

1480
01:11:39,244 --> 01:11:40,847
SAM: I speak Keyleth.

1481
01:11:40,847 --> 01:11:42,322
(laughter)

1482
01:11:42,322 --> 01:11:46,921
SAM: She's saying that he should wait here until
our instructions to attack.

1483
01:11:46,921 --> 01:11:49,983
LAURA: Okay. Go ahead and translate that.

1484
01:11:49,983 --> 01:11:59,214
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, uh. (speaks Undercommon)

1485
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:03,711
MATT: Slings the club onto his shoulder with a
hefty (impact sound). You all feel the actual

1486
01:12:03,711 --> 01:12:10,892
impact on his body, just the nearby presence, the
air around him being pushed. Looks at you for a

1487
01:12:10,892 --> 01:12:16,949
second. Looks back to Keyleth and gives a solid
nod and just stands there.

1488
01:12:16,949 --> 01:12:21,304
MARISHA: I take that as a good nod.

1489
01:12:21,304 --> 01:12:25,055
LAURA: Will this keep up while you're sleeping?
Just curious.

1490
01:12:25,055 --> 01:12:26,355
MARISHA: It keeps up for 30 days.

1491
01:12:26,355 --> 01:12:27,232
ORION: 30 days.

1492
01:12:27,232 --> 01:12:28,233
LAURA: Oh we're set.

1493
01:12:28,233 --> 01:12:29,236
TRAVIS: Awesome!

1494
01:12:29,236 --> 01:12:30,503
ORION: I walk up to the giant and I take out my
jerky.

1495
01:12:30,503 --> 01:12:33,341
LAURA: Can we heal him? If we heal him, will it
cancel it?

1496
01:12:33,341 --> 01:12:34,656
LIAM: Vex'ahlia.

1497
01:12:34,656 --> 01:12:35,934
LAURA: What?

1498
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:37,514
LIAM: Ask him what his name is.

1499
01:12:37,514 --> 01:12:44,397
MATT: His hand reaches down and completely
envelops your fist. And just pulls away. Jerky is

1500
01:12:44,465 --> 01:12:47,612
gone from your hand and you feel, probably, a few
scales went with.

1501
01:12:47,612 --> 01:12:56,419
LAURA: I grunt at him. And ask what his name is.
"Vex-'ah-lia."

1502
01:12:56,419 --> 01:13:01,017
ORION: Do we all have to say it that way,
Vex'ahlia?

1503
01:13:01,017 --> 01:13:02,621
MATT: Just glares at you.

1504
01:13:02,621 --> 01:13:03,731
LAURA: Oh, come on.

1505
01:13:03,731 --> 01:13:08,251
ASHLEY: I'm going to tell him he's handsome.
(speaks Undercommon)

1506
01:13:08,251 --> 01:13:12,295
(laughter)

1507
01:13:12,295 --> 01:13:21,369
MATT: The big eye squints in confusion at the tiny
thing. And just keeps licking the remnants of beef

1508
01:13:21,369 --> 01:13:24,666
jerky off his fingers that it just robbed Tiberius
of.

1509
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:26,660
ORION: He likes the jerky.

1510
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:28,515
ASHLEY: I thought I'd try.

1511
01:13:28,515 --> 01:13:29,934
MARISHA: What should we call him?

1512
01:13:29,934 --> 01:13:31,205
LAURA: I think we should name him--

1513
01:13:31,205 --> 01:13:32,937
ORION: We should ask his name and be polite.

1514
01:13:32,937 --> 01:13:34,339
SAM: We did, he didn't give it.

1515
01:13:34,339 --> 01:13:35,749
LAURA: We should name him Tiny.

1516
01:13:35,749 --> 01:13:36,650
MARISHA: Tiny!

1517
01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:37,634
SAM: Tiny, that's clever.

1518
01:13:37,634 --> 01:13:39,670
TALIESIN: Vax and I are still getting something
out of there.

1519
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:44,765
MATT: All right, so the two of you guys move
towards the pit. You're what, now? You are--

1520
01:13:44,765 --> 01:13:46,983
TALIESIN: I'm lowering him down on a rope.

1521
01:13:46,983 --> 01:13:52,910
MATT: Okay. You hold on, you get down. The spikes,
now that you are up close, you can see, are about

1522
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:54,982
five and a half feet in length.

1523
01:13:54,982 --> 01:13:55,844
LIAM: Yes.

1524
01:13:55,844 --> 01:14:01,095
MATT: At the base, about that wide. And pretty
nasty, jagged, covered in whatever rust, soot, ash

1525
01:14:01,095 --> 01:14:02,197
found its way there.

1526
01:14:02,197 --> 01:14:03,223
LIAM: Tetanus, yeah.

1527
01:14:03,223 --> 01:14:09,268
MATT: It's nasty times. It's going to be a little
careful to get in there without hurting yourself.

1528
01:14:09,268 --> 01:14:10,140
LIAM: All right.

1529
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:14,573
MATT: Go ahead and make just a straight dexterity
check.

1530
01:14:14,573 --> 01:14:15,999
LIAM: That's a 25.

1531
01:14:15,999 --> 01:14:20,608
MATT: 25. You manage to, Mission Impossible-style,
swing underneath, grab the rope. You manage to

1532
01:14:20,608 --> 01:14:26,666
keep yourself at a lithe, side angle where you
reach between two of the jagged spikes. Reach down

1533
01:14:26,666 --> 01:14:33,634
and grab this metal pole that was shining. Pull it
out and it's an intricate

1534
01:14:33,634 --> 01:14:36,522
gold and bronze javelin.

1535
01:14:36,522 --> 01:14:39,061
SAM: You found booty?

1536
01:14:39,061 --> 01:14:46,417
LIAM: Pull me up. Well, I can't use this.

1537
01:14:46,417 --> 01:14:47,718
LAURA: What is it?

1538
01:14:47,718 --> 01:14:49,162
LIAM: It's a javelin. It's beautiful.

1539
01:14:49,162 --> 01:14:50,570
TRAVIS: Will you inspect it?

1540
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:52,257
SAM: Beautiful things should go to Pike, I think.

1541
01:14:52,257 --> 01:14:56,125
ASHLEY: Oh, Scanlan, but she has really good aim.

1542
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:59,978
LIAM: She doesn't really throw sharp, pointy
things. This would be good for you, big guy.

1543
01:14:59,978 --> 01:15:04,624
SAM: I just feel that the gold of the javelin
would match the gold of your heart.

1544
01:15:04,624 --> 01:15:06,022
ASHLEY: Oh, Scanlan!

1545
01:15:06,022 --> 01:15:07,962
ORION: I'm going to inspect it. Arcana check. 23.

1546
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:09,162
MATT: 23. Okay.

1547
01:15:09,162 --> 01:15:11,562
LIAM: I'm still holding it. Tell me about it.

1548
01:15:11,562 --> 01:15:17,704
ORION: Oh, this is, of course, the Javelin of
Lightning. This javelin is a magic weapon. When

1549
01:15:17,704 --> 01:15:22,561
you hurl it, and speak its command word, it
transforms into a bolt of lightning.

1550
01:15:22,561 --> 01:15:24,065
SAM: Sounds a little "read"-y.

1551
01:15:24,065 --> 01:15:25,035
ORION: Yeah.

1552
01:15:25,035 --> 01:15:27,462
(laughter)

1553
01:15:27,462 --> 01:15:29,829
ORION: You know what? I'm not on the clock. You
read it.

1554
01:15:29,829 --> 01:15:31,773
(laughter)

1555
01:15:31,773 --> 01:15:38,410
SAM: Bolt of lightning, five feet wide. Basically,
it's just lightning. But in a javelin.

1556
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:40,131
MATT: Pass it on to Grog.

1557
01:15:40,131 --> 01:15:42,937
LIAM: I spin it, rotate it in my hand, handle
towards Grog.

1558
01:15:42,937 --> 01:15:47,189
TRAVIS: (singsong) I have something that's magic.

1559
01:15:47,189 --> 01:15:50,673
MATT: All right, so.

1560
01:15:50,673 --> 01:15:52,710
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

1561
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:54,108
ASHLEY: What are you going to name it?

1562
01:15:54,108 --> 01:15:55,239
TRAVIS: Penelope.

1563
01:15:55,239 --> 01:15:57,603
MATT: You guys now stand on the outskirts of
Yug'voril. We're a little ways from Yug'voril and

1564
01:15:57,603 --> 01:16:02,391
the fungal forests. In the distance, you can
barely see the dull, greenish glow of what

1565
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:07,428
encompasses the top of the temple. What is your
plan of action, as you've now bound a Fomorian to

1566
01:16:07,428 --> 01:16:08,348
your will?

1567
01:16:08,348 --> 01:16:09,842
LAURA: I feel like we should hop down into the
pit.

1568
01:16:09,842 --> 01:16:10,918
SAM: Fomorian?

1569
01:16:10,918 --> 01:16:11,977
LIAM: Of spikes?

1570
01:16:11,977 --> 01:16:15,975
LAURA: No no no, not that pit. In the big pit. And
rest. And that way we're blocked from view.

1571
01:16:15,975 --> 01:16:18,463
TALIESIN: Heal our, what are we calling him?

1572
01:16:18,463 --> 01:16:19,518
LAURA: Tiny.

1573
01:16:19,518 --> 01:16:20,693
TALIESIN: Tiny. Heal Tiny.

1574
01:16:20,693 --> 01:16:22,002
MARISHA: He's a Fomorian?

1575
01:16:22,002 --> 01:16:27,386
SAM: Just before we rest, does anyone have
knowledge of his race and his species? Any of his

1576
01:16:27,386 --> 01:16:32,706
weaknesses or strengths? Can I do a history
check?

1577
01:16:32,706 --> 01:16:34,498
ORION: I'll do a history check.

1578
01:16:34,498 --> 01:16:35,756
MATT: Well, this will be more of a--

1579
01:16:35,756 --> 01:16:38,154
SAM: That's a one.

1580
01:16:38,154 --> 01:16:39,578
ORION: Nature check? What kind of check?

1581
01:16:39,578 --> 01:16:41,766
MATT: Yeah, this would be a-- This will be just a
nature check.

1582
01:16:41,766 --> 01:16:45,133
MARISHA: What are we checking?

1583
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:48,589
SAM: Nature check. Just to see, what are his
strengths and weakness? What about his race?

1584
01:16:48,589 --> 01:16:51,621
MARISHA: Ooh! The Fromorians. Well, the
Fromorians--

1585
01:16:51,621 --> 01:16:53,130
MATT: Foh-morians.

1586
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:54,351
MARISHA: For-morians.

1587
01:16:54,351 --> 01:16:55,371
MATT: Foh-morians.

1588
01:16:55,371 --> 01:16:56,335
MARISHA: Foh-morians.

1589
01:16:56,335 --> 01:16:57,277
SAM: FOH-MOH-ree-ans.

1590
01:16:57,277 --> 01:16:58,467
MARISHA: Foh-MOH-ree-ans.

1591
01:16:58,467 --> 01:16:59,559
TALIESIN: Accent is just terrible.

1592
01:16:59,559 --> 01:17:00,485
MATT: What'd you roll?

1593
01:17:00,485 --> 01:17:03,627
MARISHA: An 18 plus ten, so 28. Fomo.

1594
01:17:03,627 --> 01:17:07,304
MATT: All right. Between you and your
understanding of the Underdark, as well, you

1595
01:17:07,304 --> 01:17:12,339
manage to suss out a Fomorian is a long-cursed
species of giant that lives in the Underdark,

1596
01:17:12,339 --> 01:17:20,758
specifically. That's why its form is so malformed
and physically messed up. They are inherently very

1597
01:17:20,758 --> 01:17:27,770
evil, very selfish creatures and the fact that you
even have it in your presence says well of your

1598
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:33,334
magic, but also means it's probably very, very,
very minimal in its control or ability to really

1599
01:17:33,334 --> 01:17:35,634
help you unless it absolutely has to.

1600
01:17:35,634 --> 01:17:37,504
ORION: The giant guy?

1601
01:17:37,504 --> 01:17:39,058
MATT: So.

1602
01:17:39,058 --> 01:17:41,852
MARISHA: Yeah. Well, I mean, it sort of has to.

1603
01:17:41,852 --> 01:17:43,328
LAURA: Right?

1604
01:17:43,328 --> 01:17:45,491
SAM: It doesn't have to do it with all its heart.

1605
01:17:45,491 --> 01:17:47,294
MARISHA: It starts to fry his brain if he
doesn't.

1606
01:17:47,294 --> 01:17:51,334
MATT: Sometimes things might want to take damage,
depending on what you tell it to do.

1607
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:52,143
LAURA: Oh.

1608
01:17:52,143 --> 01:17:53,444
ORION: It depends on what we say.

1609
01:17:53,444 --> 01:17:54,663
LAURA: Well, can we ask him?

1610
01:17:54,663 --> 01:17:58,367
MATT: Just saying you're riding a very fine line
keeping this thing not thrashing and smashing your

1611
01:17:58,367 --> 01:17:59,610
head right now.

1612
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:05,180
LAURA: Can we ask him, I mean, if K'Varn is
annoying to him, or if he likes him?

1613
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,766
MATT: You ask in Undercommon?

1614
01:18:06,766 --> 01:18:08,167
LAURA: Yeah.

1615
01:18:08,167 --> 01:18:17,467
MATT: The best you can get out of his response is
the equivalent of, "I don't really know or care. I

1616
01:18:17,538 --> 01:18:26,184
"hunt. I find things that wander too far from this
city. And occasionally squash a dwarf or two."

1617
01:18:26,184 --> 01:18:29,947
SAM: Do we know what sorts of things he either
hates or likes?

1618
01:18:29,947 --> 01:18:31,730
TALIESIN: We've got a distraction!

1619
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:33,277
TRAVIS AND LAURA: Yeah!

1620
01:18:33,277 --> 01:18:37,303
TALIESIN: Forget the fight. We can just send him
off into the city and that should be enough for us

1621
01:18:37,303 --> 01:18:38,297
to sneak in.

1622
01:18:38,297 --> 01:18:39,442
SAM: That's pretty good, too.

1623
01:18:39,442 --> 01:18:40,748
LAURA: Yeah, that's true.

1624
01:18:40,748 --> 01:18:42,627
ORION: I am not setting foot in that temple quite
yet.

1625
01:18:42,627 --> 01:18:48,438
LAURA: No no no. We'll come up with an idea, but,
I mean, it's something. Keyleth, is it safe to

1626
01:18:48,438 --> 01:18:51,448
sleep next to him? Or is he going to attack us
when we sleep?

1627
01:18:51,448 --> 01:18:57,710
MARISHA: We might be able to box him up, or maybe
we should chain him up while we sleep or

1628
01:18:57,710 --> 01:19:00,274
something. I don't know. I mean, he should be
okay.

1629
01:19:00,274 --> 01:19:04,232
LIAM: Take the watch, like we normally do.

1630
01:19:04,232 --> 01:19:08,099
MATT: Kima, looking at him, says, "I'm not
sleeping next to him."

1631
01:19:08,099 --> 01:19:11,224
SAM: I'll sleep near you, Kima.

1632
01:19:11,224 --> 01:19:16,704
MATT: Her eyes, for a moment, seem to dart to your
shoulder where you had previously shown her your

1633
01:19:16,704 --> 01:19:23,688
awkward, purple, third nipple. "I'm fine, Scanlan,
but I-- I appreciate the offer?"

1634
01:19:23,688 --> 01:19:25,501
SAM: Suit yourself.

1635
01:19:25,501 --> 01:19:26,978
TALIESIN: That's just a sentence you don't hear
very often.

1636
01:19:26,978 --> 01:19:29,546
ASHLEY: I have a question. You said he's a cursed
giant?

1637
01:19:29,546 --> 01:19:35,647
MATT: Meaning, not him, individually. His actual
species long ago. It was a line of giants that was

1638
01:19:35,647 --> 01:19:40,324
cursed by the Fae to be this horrible form.

1639
01:19:40,324 --> 01:19:41,323
SAM: Well, let's rest.

1640
01:19:41,323 --> 01:19:41,994
LAURA: Yeah.

1641
01:19:41,994 --> 01:19:43,251
SAM: In shifts.

1642
01:19:43,251 --> 01:19:45,582
LAURA: Maybe we can chain him up to something
while we sleep.

1643
01:19:45,582 --> 01:19:47,695
SAM: No. We don't want to seem aggressive towards
him.

1644
01:19:47,695 --> 01:19:48,690
LAURA: Oh, fine.

1645
01:19:48,690 --> 01:19:50,334
ORION: He's fine for 30 days.

1646
01:19:50,334 --> 01:19:52,973
LAURA: Who's taking the first watch? All right.

1647
01:19:52,973 --> 01:19:54,234
TALIESIN: I'll take the first watch.

1648
01:19:54,234 --> 01:19:55,779
LAURA: I gotta heal up.

1649
01:19:55,779 --> 01:19:57,506
LIAM: I'll sit up with Percy.

1650
01:19:57,506 --> 01:20:01,399
MARISHA: Well, hang on. What are we doing from
here? Because it's going to dictate what I pick.

1651
01:20:01,399 --> 01:20:04,237
SAM: That's a good question. We're not going to
mount our full attack, are we?

1652
01:20:04,237 --> 01:20:05,106
LAURA: Are we?

1653
01:20:05,106 --> 01:20:05,842
TALIESIN: Why not?

1654
01:20:05,842 --> 01:20:06,711
ORION: No, we are not.

1655
01:20:06,711 --> 01:20:07,690
TALIESIN AND LAURA: Why not?

1656
01:20:07,690 --> 01:20:08,453
SAM: We could.

1657
01:20:08,453 --> 01:20:12,547
ORION: I am telling you right now, I am not
setting foot in that thing's lair.

1658
01:20:12,547 --> 01:20:13,315
LAURA: Okay, tell us why.

1659
01:20:13,315 --> 01:20:14,404
SAM: Until when?

1660
01:20:14,404 --> 01:20:18,624
ORION: Until we figure out a damn way to get it
out of that lair.

1661
01:20:18,624 --> 01:20:19,896
SAM: You want it out of the temple.

1662
01:20:19,896 --> 01:20:20,951
ORION: Absolutely.

1663
01:20:20,951 --> 01:20:22,371
TALIESIN: We're not going to be able to do that.

1664
01:20:22,371 --> 01:20:28,325
ORION: Percy! I'm saying this right now, I'm not
stepping foot in that lair!

1665
01:20:28,325 --> 01:20:30,460
TALIESIN: That's fine. We're not going to be able
to get him out, I don't think.

1666
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:31,840
ORION: I think we can, actually.

1667
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,190
TALIESIN: Well?

1668
01:20:33,190 --> 01:20:34,859
ORION: My idea is this--

1669
01:20:34,859 --> 01:20:36,384
LAURA: Okay, yes. Please, tell us.

1670
01:20:36,384 --> 01:20:43,452
ORION: With the new addition of our giant friend,
we do have a great advantage. We can definitely

1671
01:20:43,452 --> 01:20:52,541
make the distraction, as you say. I propose,
Keyleth and another stealth member somehow see a

1672
01:20:52,541 --> 01:20:59,584
way if there is some kind of ventilation that
leads into the Major Butthole's chamber.

1673
01:20:59,584 --> 01:21:01,249
LAURA: The temple that you won't set foot in.

1674
01:21:01,249 --> 01:21:02,076
ORION: Yes.

1675
01:21:02,076 --> 01:21:03,066
LAURA: You want somebody else to go into.

1676
01:21:03,066 --> 01:21:03,755
ORION: Absolutely.

1677
01:21:03,755 --> 01:21:04,755
LAURA: All right.

1678
01:21:04,755 --> 01:21:09,580
ORION: And, when finding this, craft some type of
piping system where we could smoke him out. If he

1679
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:13,478
has to breathe, which I believe aberrations need
to breathe and eat.

1680
01:21:13,478 --> 01:21:16,484
LAURA: Do I know that? Do aberrations need to
breathe?

1681
01:21:16,484 --> 01:21:21,905
MATT: Best that you understand, not a lot of study
has gone into the breathing apparatuses of certain

1682
01:21:21,905 --> 01:21:24,501
aberrations and the few that have been close
enough to a beholder

1683
01:21:24,501 --> 01:21:26,537
haven't really tested that theory.

1684
01:21:26,537 --> 01:21:28,196
LAURA: All right.

1685
01:21:28,196 --> 01:21:33,622
ORION: If we smoke him out and he cannot breathe,
he must leave the facility. And if we go in there

1686
01:21:33,622 --> 01:21:37,755
we would be at an extreme disadvantage in many
ways than we realize.

1687
01:21:37,755 --> 01:21:39,382
TALIESIN: How are we going to smoke him out?

1688
01:21:39,382 --> 01:21:43,377
ORION: I just proposed the idea. I don't know, but
that's what we all need to figure out.

1689
01:21:43,377 --> 01:21:50,556
LAURA: Okay, I've also got an idea. I mean, what
about that whole plan to break apart the apparatus

1690
01:21:50,556 --> 01:21:52,343
that was holding the Elder Brain together?

1691
01:21:52,343 --> 01:21:53,537
TALIESIN: That's my thought.

1692
01:21:53,537 --> 01:21:57,959
LAURA: I think we need to go over the top, once
the distraction is in the city, blah blah blah. Go

1693
01:21:57,959 --> 01:22:01,827
over the top, acid that metal, break it apart.

1694
01:22:01,827 --> 01:22:03,183
SAM: Or giant that metal.

1695
01:22:03,183 --> 01:22:06,000
LAURA: I think it'd be hard to get the giant up to
the top of the temple.

1696
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,612
MARISHA: But we can send the giant beating on the
front temple door.

1697
01:22:10,612 --> 01:22:12,106
LAURA: But this is a brainstorming session,
everything's positive.

1698
01:22:12,106 --> 01:22:13,248
SAM: Well, not everything.

1699
01:22:13,248 --> 01:22:18,013
LAURA: Acid, whatever, break it apart. Release the
illithids from his control and then we'll have

1700
01:22:18,013 --> 01:22:20,648
them on our side. At least, not our side, but
against him.

1701
01:22:20,648 --> 01:22:21,715
ORION: That's what I'm talking about.

1702
01:22:21,715 --> 01:22:22,662
TALIESIN: Absolutely.

1703
01:22:22,662 --> 01:22:24,422
ORION: Oh, so there are prisoners, right?

1704
01:22:24,422 --> 01:22:27,215
LAURA: All of the illithid in the city are his
prisoners. He's controlling everyone.

1705
01:22:27,215 --> 01:22:32,927
ORION: Oh, so, I'm sorry, I was misled earlier. So
this is the good part of the plan. We do exactly

1706
01:22:32,927 --> 01:22:34,321
what you're saying, first.

1707
01:22:34,321 --> 01:22:37,160
LAURA: Oh, okay. That's good. I like your plan so
far.

1708
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:41,549
ORION: Clarota, here, will rally the illithid to
fight for us. That's when we

1709
01:22:41,549 --> 01:22:42,932
smoke out the beholder.

1710
01:22:42,932 --> 01:22:46,012
TALIESIN: Except, of course, by doing that, we've
destroyed the roof of the chamber, so there will

1711
01:22:46,012 --> 01:22:47,972
actually just be nothing but ventilation.

1712
01:22:47,972 --> 01:22:48,990
LAURA: Yes.

1713
01:22:48,990 --> 01:22:50,047
MARISHA: No, it was already open, remember?

1714
01:22:50,047 --> 01:22:51,775
ORION: We do it a different way. We don't go near
him.

1715
01:22:51,775 --> 01:22:54,883
ASHLEY: Do we know that it's enclosed?

1716
01:22:54,883 --> 01:22:56,173
MARISHA: No, it's open.

1717
01:22:56,173 --> 01:22:57,602
TALIESIN: It's open.

1718
01:22:57,602 --> 01:22:59,919
SAM: I can get the giant inside the temple.

1719
01:22:59,919 --> 01:23:02,251
MATT: The top has the brass crossbar.

1720
01:23:02,251 --> 01:23:03,432
LAURA: Ooh, I like that.

1721
01:23:03,432 --> 01:23:06,506
TRAVIS: But what if he just controls the giant?

1722
01:23:06,506 --> 01:23:08,686
LAURA: You know what, though? The beholder will
just take control of the giant.

1723
01:23:08,686 --> 01:23:11,089
TALIESIN: That we're talking about destroying?

1724
01:23:11,089 --> 01:23:12,868
MARISHA: Some sort of glass.

1725
01:23:12,868 --> 01:23:16,407
MATT: Some sort of translucent material that fills
in the parts that aren't the brass.

1726
01:23:16,407 --> 01:23:18,379
TALIESIN: That we're talking about destroying.

1727
01:23:18,379 --> 01:23:20,188
ORION: The room that he's in is sealed up?

1728
01:23:20,188 --> 01:23:21,446
MATT: It appears to be.

1729
01:23:21,446 --> 01:23:22,941
LAURA: I think we should keep the giant as a
distraction.

1730
01:23:22,941 --> 01:23:24,007
TRAVIS: I also have an idea.

1731
01:23:24,007 --> 01:23:25,063
LAURA: Yes, Grog.

1732
01:23:25,063 --> 01:23:27,581
TRAVIS: Ice cream and peanut butter mixed on a
cold stone.

1733
01:23:27,581 --> 01:23:29,089
SAM: It will never work. It'll never work!

1734
01:23:29,089 --> 01:23:30,033
ORION: Oh my god!

1735
01:23:30,033 --> 01:23:30,907
ASHLEY: Oh, yum!

1736
01:23:30,907 --> 01:23:32,211
ORION: That is incredible.

1737
01:23:32,211 --> 01:23:33,836
TRAVIS: I've been thinking about it for days.

1738
01:23:33,836 --> 01:23:38,798
SAM: How would you get the stone cold enough? You
would need all sorts of sides to add to it, to

1739
01:23:38,798 --> 01:23:41,379
fold into it. It's a terrible idea.

1740
01:23:41,379 --> 01:23:42,906
TRAVIS: I told you, I don't like thinking.

1741
01:23:42,906 --> 01:23:51,155
LAURA: And then also another idea. What if you
used your Pillars, right, against the Beholder and

1742
01:23:51,155 --> 01:23:55,298
trapped him in? Can you do that?

1743
01:23:55,298 --> 01:23:57,435
ORION: I am not going anywhere near that temple.

1744
01:23:57,435 --> 01:23:58,204
SAM: All right.

1745
01:23:58,204 --> 01:24:00,117
LAURA: All right, all right. What if you're
outside the temple and you cast Pillars and then

1746
01:24:00,117 --> 01:24:03,023
we go in? And you stand outside, Tiberius.

1747
01:24:03,023 --> 01:24:05,509
ORION: I mean, I suppose that could work,
possibly.

1748
01:24:05,509 --> 01:24:07,085
LAURA: What if you're on top?

1749
01:24:07,085 --> 01:24:09,001
ORION: Just has to be line of sight, right?

1750
01:24:09,001 --> 01:24:11,407
MATT: To where you want the pillar to come out of,
yeah.

1751
01:24:11,407 --> 01:24:15,195
ORION: Mm-hm, right, yeah. Actually that could
work. I could do it from afar,

1752
01:24:15,195 --> 01:24:16,625
maybe on the carpet.

1753
01:24:16,625 --> 01:24:19,547
LAURA: That gives us something to hide behind,
right? At least, with his eyeballs.

1754
01:24:19,547 --> 01:24:21,280
ORION: Yes.

1755
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:23,760
ASHLEY: We still have to go through the fungal
forest, right?

1756
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:24,550
LAURA: Yes.

1757
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:26,948
SAM: How far is the forest, before the city?

1758
01:24:26,948 --> 01:24:32,197
MATT: All right, so, to bring the map on top,
here. Where you guys currently reside, which is

1759
01:24:32,197 --> 01:24:39,962
this portion here. You imagine, based on the
distance you traveled, you have about a mile or so

1760
01:24:39,962 --> 01:24:41,675
before you get to the city.

1761
01:24:41,675 --> 01:24:42,662
LAURA: A mile.

1762
01:24:42,662 --> 01:24:43,685
MATT: Maybe a little over a mile.

1763
01:24:43,685 --> 01:24:45,175
ASHLEY: Man, I wish we had some Cold Stone right
now.

1764
01:24:45,175 --> 01:24:49,513
MATT: Actually probably a mile and half before you
get into the city, which is about two miles from

1765
01:24:49,513 --> 01:24:50,784
the temple.

1766
01:24:50,784 --> 01:24:53,018
TRAVIS: Right? Doesn't that sound amazing?

1767
01:24:53,018 --> 01:24:54,845
LIAM: We need to find a frost giant, first.

1768
01:24:54,845 --> 01:24:57,238
TRAVIS: I'm just saying, we could leave this
fucker here, go mix some peanut butter and ice

1769
01:24:57,238 --> 01:24:59,450
cream, everybody's happy!

1770
01:24:59,450 --> 01:25:01,381
SAM: That plan is growing on me.

1771
01:25:01,381 --> 01:25:03,276
ASHLEY: We'll sleep. Should we nap?

1772
01:25:03,276 --> 01:25:04,812
SAM: Let's take a rest.

1773
01:25:04,812 --> 01:25:10,637
LAURA: What are we going to do? We're just going
to go in without a plan? What are we going to do?

1774
01:25:10,637 --> 01:25:13,738
ASHLEY: How's Vax's foot?

1775
01:25:13,738 --> 01:25:15,682
SAM: Tomorrow we can stealth in and get some
intel.

1776
01:25:15,682 --> 01:25:18,933
MATT: It's already been attempted to be healed
this day.

1777
01:25:18,933 --> 01:25:20,888
LAURA: Oh, we can do it in the morning?

1778
01:25:20,888 --> 01:25:22,574
MATT: Yeah, it's like a once a day kind of thing.

1779
01:25:22,574 --> 01:25:27,410
TRAVIS: Liam, we need you to stealth in and get
some awesome recon, but that means

1780
01:25:27,410 --> 01:25:29,049
you'll be at risk.

1781
01:25:29,049 --> 01:25:30,852
TALIESIN: We're going to need to destroy the
mechanism.

1782
01:25:30,852 --> 01:25:33,200
SAM: A suicide mission? He was born for this.

1783
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:37,904
LAURA: The big one is releasing the Elder Brain.
We need to do that before we teleport.

1784
01:25:37,904 --> 01:25:42,525
MARISHA: Yeah. Okay, here's my thing. Why do we
need to do reconnaissance? We already know what we

1785
01:25:42,525 --> 01:25:43,597
need to do.

1786
01:25:43,597 --> 01:25:44,911
TALIESIN: We've already done reconnaissance.

1787
01:25:44,911 --> 01:25:47,330
LIAM: Well, we saw through Keyleth's Scrying.

1788
01:25:47,330 --> 01:25:49,189
LAURA: Right, so we know what's going on.

1789
01:25:49,189 --> 01:25:50,407
LIAM: Somewhat.

1790
01:25:50,407 --> 01:25:55,571
TALIESIN: We know that there's a mechanism inside
that room. We know that that's probably what's

1791
01:25:55,571 --> 01:25:56,542
keeping the brain.

1792
01:25:56,542 --> 01:25:58,218
ASHLEY: We should just go knock on the door.

1793
01:25:58,218 --> 01:25:59,861
(laughter)

1794
01:25:59,861 --> 01:26:01,082
ASHLEY: Hello?

1795
01:26:01,082 --> 01:26:02,476
TRAVIS: I think Pike's onto something.

1796
01:26:02,476 --> 01:26:07,263
SAM: We should do some recon. There might be
beings or creatures around there that we can

1797
01:26:07,263 --> 01:26:09,981
distract, use to our advantage, something.

1798
01:26:09,981 --> 01:26:14,516
LAURA: I feel like we should get up close, release
the giant, fly up over, do our shit, and then take him.

1799
01:26:14,516 --> 01:26:16,744
SAM: All right, but we don't know how we're going
to break that thing.

1800
01:26:16,744 --> 01:26:17,937
LAURA: Acid.

1801
01:26:17,937 --> 01:26:19,016
SAM: We don't have acid.

1802
01:26:19,016 --> 01:26:20,322
LAURA: We have acid.

1803
01:26:20,322 --> 01:26:21,250
SAM: How much?

1804
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:22,438
ORION: I bring out the yellow vial.

1805
01:26:22,438 --> 01:26:24,401
LAURA: And we've got a bunch of acid in Grog's
bag.

1806
01:26:24,401 --> 01:26:25,615
SAM: We do have that yellow vial.

1807
01:26:25,615 --> 01:26:26,840
TRAVIS: We have four acid vials, plus that.

1808
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:28,457
ORION: This is the thing that's going to hurt the
most.

1809
01:26:28,457 --> 01:26:29,951
SAM: We don't know. It could make it stronger.

1810
01:26:30,173 --> 01:26:33,240
MARISHA: Well, I mean, I could do some Heat Metal
and weaken it.

1811
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:36,197
ASHLEY: I feel like we should save that acid for
the beholder.

1812
01:26:36,197 --> 01:26:41,051
TRAVIS: Remember, the argument was also that it
will be magically treated to withstand simple acid.

1813
01:26:41,051 --> 01:26:45,838
MARISHA: The Elder Brain casing was, not
necessarily the cross.

1814
01:26:45,838 --> 01:26:52,908
TALIESIN: I want to experiment on the-- I want to
do a couple things. I want to first take, using my

1815
01:26:52,908 --> 01:26:59,075
little kit, I want to just beaker off a tiny bit
of it and expose it to some organic matter to see

1816
01:26:59,075 --> 01:27:00,145
how it reacts.

1817
01:27:00,145 --> 01:27:00,975
MATT: Okay.

1818
01:27:00,975 --> 01:27:03,384
TALIESIN: And expose it to a little bit of
inorganic matter to see how it reacts.

1819
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:11,525
MATT: So you take a bit of the swirling, yellow,
orange-ish viscous fluid out of-- You place it

1820
01:27:11,525 --> 01:27:18,286
against some organic matter, which, you find
somewhere in the vicinity, partially rotted chunks of--

1821
01:27:18,286 --> 01:27:19,317
TALIESIN: Flesh.

1822
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:24,650
MATT: -- flesh from the pile the Fomorian was
sleeping on. As you place it on, it blackens the

1823
01:27:24,650 --> 01:27:27,179
flesh around it. There is a sizzling sound.

1824
01:27:27,179 --> 01:27:31,498
TALIESIN: Interesting. Now I want to try it on
some inorganic matter.

1825
01:27:31,498 --> 01:27:33,972
MATT: Which organic matter? Which inorganic
matter?

1826
01:27:33,972 --> 01:27:35,004
LAURA: Do we have any metal?

1827
01:27:35,004 --> 01:27:36,301
SAM: I have a dagger that I never use.

1828
01:27:36,301 --> 01:27:39,160
ASHLEY: I have some rusty instruments.

1829
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:40,656
SAM: Great. Rusty instruments?

1830
01:27:40,656 --> 01:27:41,751
ASHLEY: From the torture room.

1831
01:27:41,751 --> 01:27:43,094
ORION: Do you have a rusty trombone?

1832
01:27:43,094 --> 01:27:46,564
(groaning and laughter)

1833
01:27:46,564 --> 01:27:48,702
ORION: Sorry. What? I don't understand.

1834
01:27:48,702 --> 01:27:53,380
SAM: I use my Minor Illusion to create a (failure
horn sound).

1835
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:56,258
(laughter)

1836
01:27:56,258 --> 01:28:01,147
TALIESIN: I would like a couple things. I would
like one of the rusty instruments and I would like

1837
01:28:01,147 --> 01:28:02,590
one of the diamonds, please.

1838
01:28:02,590 --> 01:28:04,355
TRAVIS: Yeah, here. You can have it. Here.

1839
01:28:04,355 --> 01:28:05,878
LAURA: No! Oh, Percy, why?

1840
01:28:05,878 --> 01:28:09,253
TALIESIN: So that we find out if it's going to be
useful. If it's just acid, it won't do a thing to

1841
01:28:09,253 --> 01:28:10,407
the diamond.

1842
01:28:10,407 --> 01:28:11,616
TRAVIS: How about a sapphire?

1843
01:28:11,616 --> 01:28:12,860
TALIESIN: Or a sapphire, fine.

1844
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:16,464
TRAVIS: My fine blue sapphire that's been in here
for a year and a half. You can have it.

1845
01:28:16,464 --> 01:28:17,764
LIAM: Care for some Cold Stone?

1846
01:28:17,764 --> 01:28:21,771
TALIESIN: And some Cold Stone. I want to try it on
some ice cream with peanut butter.

1847
01:28:21,771 --> 01:28:22,882
(laughter)

1848
01:28:22,882 --> 01:28:25,527
TALIESIN: I want to mix the acid in. Add some
raspberries.

1849
01:28:25,527 --> 01:28:28,259
MATT: So you're putting it on?

1850
01:28:28,259 --> 01:28:32,356
TALIESIN: On one of the rusty instruments, and on
a sapphire.

1851
01:28:32,356 --> 01:28:33,673
ASHLEY: What's a rusty trombone?

1852
01:28:33,673 --> 01:28:34,938
(laughter)

1853
01:28:34,938 --> 01:28:36,221
SAM: Oh, Pike.

1854
01:28:36,221 --> 01:28:37,354
TALIESIN: Shutting it down.

1855
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:38,767
MATT: (shouts) Google will answer that at the
break!

1856
01:28:38,767 --> 01:28:40,308
MARISHA: Don't Google it.

1857
01:28:40,308 --> 01:28:41,805
SAM: Chatroom, please help out Ashley.

1858
01:28:41,805 --> 01:28:44,118
LAURA: No no no. Don't.

1859
01:28:44,118 --> 01:28:49,408
MATT: So, as you take a dab of it and you place it
on the rusty instrument, which actually looks like

1860
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:55,901
some weird hooked crowbar-type implement. The rust
immediately cleans off and the metal underneath

1861
01:28:55,901 --> 01:29:02,273
begins to slowly warp and bend and then dissolve
at the place where you dripped it.

1862
01:29:02,273 --> 01:29:03,750
SAM: Good, that's good.

1863
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:11,076
MATT: Placing it on the sapphire, it kind of coats
it, slips off and begins to burn the ground around

1864
01:29:11,076 --> 01:29:12,257
the sapphire.

1865
01:29:12,257 --> 01:29:13,637
TALIESIN: Interesting, all right.

1866
01:29:13,637 --> 01:29:14,628
SAM: Good on metal.

1867
01:29:14,628 --> 01:29:16,796
TALIESIN: Good on metal, not so good, necessarily
on--

1868
01:29:16,796 --> 01:29:18,682
LAURA: On jewels. That's okay.

1869
01:29:18,682 --> 01:29:24,005
TALIESIN: If the glass is glass, the glass will
break. If the glass is something else, we may have

1870
01:29:24,005 --> 01:29:25,251
to burrow through it.

1871
01:29:25,251 --> 01:29:28,185
LAURA: Sapphire's okay, then? Is it clean? Does it
have any acid still on it?

1872
01:29:28,185 --> 01:29:29,652
TRAVIS: It's coming back to me, don't reach for
it.

1873
01:29:29,652 --> 01:29:31,759
TALIESIN: I'm going to clean off the sapphire.

1874
01:29:31,759 --> 01:29:39,125
MATT: Clean it off. It looks like there are very,
very minor pockmarks across the surface, but yeah.

1875
01:29:39,125 --> 01:29:41,293
TALIESIN: We're good. We're very, very good.

1876
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:42,659
TRAVIS: I'll take the sapphire back.

1877
01:29:42,659 --> 01:29:48,550
MARISHA: I can possibly-- I'll make sure I learn
Heat Metal and I can heat the edges of the

1878
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:55,851
crossbeam. And then if we can have Grog bring
something heavy after we've weakened it.

1879
01:29:55,851 --> 01:29:58,022
LAURA: I know! I think a big weight, once it's
been acid-ed.

1880
01:29:58,022 --> 01:29:59,288
SAM: How about a giant?

1881
01:29:59,288 --> 01:30:00,271
TRAVIS: I could just jump on it.

1882
01:30:00,271 --> 01:30:02,414
LAURA: Well, it's on the top of the temple, that's
what I mean. If you can jump on it, then we'll be

1883
01:30:02,414 --> 01:30:03,590
going down with it.

1884
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:04,894
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Yeah, that's all right.

1885
01:30:04,894 --> 01:30:06,508
ORION: It will simply just heat it.

1886
01:30:06,508 --> 01:30:08,719
MARISHA: Hot metal bends.

1887
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:14,904
LIAM: We've had a lot of success flying around,
right? What if, and I don't know who does what,

1888
01:30:14,904 --> 01:30:22,814
but what if one small group flew in with Tiny in
the form of a mouse. And then--

1889
01:30:22,814 --> 01:30:24,104
SAM: Dropped him.

1890
01:30:24,104 --> 01:30:29,739
LIAM: With instructions and drop him, and in
mid-fall, a cursed giant lands at the front door.

1891
01:30:29,739 --> 01:30:33,727
And if you're on the flying carpet dropping him,
you get out of there.

1892
01:30:33,727 --> 01:30:38,679
LAURA: What if cursed giant lands on the metal
beam after we've already weakened it?

1893
01:30:38,679 --> 01:30:40,156
TRAVIS: Yeah, I like that more.

1894
01:30:40,156 --> 01:30:41,650
LIAM: That's good too.

1895
01:30:41,650 --> 01:30:43,569
LAURA: Yeah, that is good.

1896
01:30:43,569 --> 01:30:46,799
LIAM: But he could go apeshit on us.

1897
01:30:46,799 --> 01:30:50,592
LAURA: No no no. Not if he's alone up there. What
if we do it, do it, do it--

1898
01:30:50,592 --> 01:30:56,536
SAM: I think what Vax is proposing is to create a
diversion down there while we work on the metal.

1899
01:30:56,536 --> 01:30:58,319
Try to weaken it.

1900
01:30:58,319 --> 01:31:04,951
LIAM: Half the team gets into position on the top
of that thing. The other half splits off, drops

1901
01:31:04,951 --> 01:31:10,736
the giant, the giant goes apeshit for like a
minute. Right? Drawing help away from the

1902
01:31:10,736 --> 01:31:16,447
beholder, drawing attention down there. We wait
for a minute, then start pouring acid and Grog

1903
01:31:16,447 --> 01:31:19,758
smashes it with his fucking forehead.

1904
01:31:19,758 --> 01:31:21,792
LAURA AND TRAVIS: Yes.

1905
01:31:21,792 --> 01:31:33,141
MARISHA: Can you levitate or do something to move
a giant boulder that we can drop on top of it?

1906
01:31:33,141 --> 01:31:35,751
ORION: Of course I can.

1907
01:31:35,751 --> 01:31:46,050
LIAM: Can we recap on your-- You looked in using
your magics, and you saw-- Tell us what she told us.

1908
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:48,520
LAURA: Can we remember? I have advantage to recall
information.

1909
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:53,952
MATT: Essentially what you had seen in the vision
was, within this room, there is that giant brass,

1910
01:31:53,952 --> 01:31:59,376
gold, bronze-looking structure that, almost like
an upside-down Christmas tree, it comes to a

1911
01:31:59,376 --> 01:32:06,311
spiraling point above the Elder Brain pool, which
is in a raised platform in the center of the room.

1912
01:32:06,311 --> 01:32:13,468
To one side, there are two large cages that
contain what look like some sort of skinless

1913
01:32:13,468 --> 01:32:18,030
creatures that are currently being experimented
on. On the far end of that room, there is a table

1914
01:32:18,030 --> 01:32:21,278
that was set up with implements. This is probably
in the process of what K'Varn has been, just

1915
01:32:21,278 --> 01:32:28,606
having fun toying with flesh. On the opposite side
of the room, it was shrouded in darkness and that

1916
01:32:28,606 --> 01:32:32,876
was where you saw K'Varn reveal itself out of the
shadow.

1917
01:32:32,876 --> 01:32:37,833
TRAVIS: One question. If we break the thing at the
top and the upside-down Christmas tree falls into

1918
01:32:37,833 --> 01:32:42,534
the Elder Brain pool thing, are we going to kill
all of the illithids in the city in one fell

1919
01:32:42,534 --> 01:32:43,625
swoop?

1920
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:46,264
MARISHA: Well, according to Clarota, it was pretty
heavily--

1921
01:32:46,264 --> 01:32:51,841
MATT: Which, at this point as you say that,
Clarota goes, "That is not an option."

1922
01:32:51,841 --> 01:32:53,075
ORION: Not saying it is, Clarota.

1923
01:32:53,075 --> 01:32:54,727
ASHLEY: No, we're just trying to see if, maybe, we
could--

1924
01:32:54,727 --> 01:32:57,617
LAURA: We didn't want it to happen, we just were
making sure it wouldn't.

1925
01:32:57,617 --> 01:33:05,401
MARISHA: You mentioned that the Elder Brain was
pretty protected from physical damage. That there

1926
01:33:05,401 --> 01:33:07,820
was lots of magical enchantments and stuff?

1927
01:33:07,820 --> 01:33:08,940
ORION: Ooh, that's right.

1928
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:18,148
MATT: "It is a powerful entity, but it has its
limits in its currently weakened form."

1929
01:33:18,148 --> 01:33:25,880
LAURA: Okay. What if you cast Featherfall on it
as, right when we did it, and then we can move it

1930
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:26,932
out of the way?

1931
01:33:26,932 --> 01:33:29,286
ORION: Doesn't quite work that way. It works on
creatures. I'm not sure I could do this.

1932
01:33:29,286 --> 01:33:30,924
TALIESIN: I have a terrible idea.

1933
01:33:30,924 --> 01:33:32,479
SAM: Great, let's hear it.

1934
01:33:32,479 --> 01:33:34,285
TRAVIS: I'm full of those, but let's hear yours.

1935
01:33:34,285 --> 01:33:41,087
TALIESIN: What if we break the fall of the device
with Clarota?

1936
01:33:41,087 --> 01:33:44,124
LAURA: Clarota? What about-- Why Clarota?

1937
01:33:44,124 --> 01:33:45,416
TALIESIN: Oh, so sorry.

1938
01:33:45,416 --> 01:33:46,794
LAURA: The giant Tiny?

1939
01:33:46,794 --> 01:33:47,987
LIAM: Kima. He means Kima

1940
01:33:47,987 --> 01:33:52,844
TALIESIN: No, I'm saying, what if we lure it into
the center of the room and then drop the ceiling

1941
01:33:52,844 --> 01:33:54,060
on top of it?

1942
01:33:54,060 --> 01:33:55,011
MARISHA: Oh, you mean--

1943
01:33:55,011 --> 01:33:56,394
LAURA: K'Varn?

1944
01:33:56,394 --> 01:33:57,867
ALL: K'Varn.

1945
01:33:57,867 --> 01:34:01,201
MATT: Clarota is currently stepping back with a
look of confusion.

1946
01:34:01,201 --> 01:34:03,215
TALIESIN: I'm a bit tired. I'm so sorry.

1947
01:34:03,215 --> 01:34:07,394
SAM: Your name is confusing to us. This is why we
wanted to call you Clarence. Sorry, sorry.

1948
01:34:07,394 --> 01:34:11,141
MATT: At the term 'Clarence', you see the
tentacles go.

1949
01:34:11,141 --> 01:34:13,835
LAURA: Oh, he's warming up to it. I think he's
liking it.

1950
01:34:13,835 --> 01:34:16,942
ORION: Clarota, how much does the crystal weigh?

1951
01:34:16,942 --> 01:34:28,244
MATT: "I do not know. I was not around when it was
created. I didn't know it existed until you saw

1952
01:34:28,244 --> 01:34:35,738
"it. I have not been in the city in months. Nearly
a year."

1953
01:34:35,738 --> 01:34:40,040
TALIESIN: I think it is definitely an option,
though. If we can lure it out of hiding and get it

1954
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:41,964
into the center of the room.

1955
01:34:41,964 --> 01:34:45,305
LAURA: I thought the Elder Brain was directly
below it, so it would have to step on the Elder

1956
01:34:45,305 --> 01:34:46,411
Brain in order to--

1957
01:34:46,411 --> 01:34:47,737
TALIESIN: Is the Elder Brain directly below it?

1958
01:34:47,737 --> 01:34:48,935
SAM: Seems too complicated.

1959
01:34:48,935 --> 01:34:50,440
LIAM: It's not one large mind, right?

1960
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:57,192
MATT: It's a series of-- The way you saw it, it is
a cluster of brains that are kind of merged

1961
01:34:57,192 --> 01:35:00,095
together into one large, hivemind mound.

1962
01:35:00,095 --> 01:35:01,148
LIAM AND LAURA: Okay.

1963
01:35:01,148 --> 01:35:02,315
TRAVIS: Who wants to go up on top?

1964
01:35:02,315 --> 01:35:03,193
LAURA: Me!

1965
01:35:03,193 --> 01:35:04,236
TRAVIS: Who would want to go down?

1966
01:35:04,236 --> 01:35:07,669
MATT: Yeah, less a crystal and more a metallic
structure.

1967
01:35:07,669 --> 01:35:16,935
MARISHA: What if, instead of letting it fall
before we fully break it, we take the rope and

1968
01:35:16,935 --> 01:35:17,813
rope it.

1969
01:35:17,813 --> 01:35:18,603
LAURA: Or chain.

1970
01:35:18,603 --> 01:35:22,941
MARISHA: And chain, and then lift it and then take
it away.

1971
01:35:22,941 --> 01:35:24,186
TALIESIN AND LAURA: Or just swing it.

1972
01:35:24,186 --> 01:35:26,421
LAURA: So it doesn't fall all the way and it goes
at a pendulum.

1973
01:35:26,421 --> 01:35:27,928
SAM: Complicated engineering.

1974
01:35:27,928 --> 01:35:29,623
ORION: Keyleth, what did the structure look like
again?

1975
01:35:29,623 --> 01:35:31,196
MARISHA: It looks like a beehive.

1976
01:35:31,196 --> 01:35:32,635
TRAVIS: Like Phantom of the Opera.

1977
01:35:32,635 --> 01:35:35,356
SAM: And it's made of metal and glass?

1978
01:35:35,356 --> 01:35:42,894
MATT: It's a slowly, like a spiraling mass of
metallic pipes, tubes, metal bands that just

1979
01:35:42,894 --> 01:35:47,110
slowly twists and comes to a gradual point, like
an upside-down Christmas tree.

1980
01:35:47,110 --> 01:35:48,641
SAM: So if it falls, it would be bad on the
brain.

1981
01:35:48,641 --> 01:35:51,446
LAURA: Right, yes. We can swing it.

1982
01:35:51,446 --> 01:35:56,347
ORION: Many structures like this-- We won't have
to, maybe, do any of that. If we could just,

1983
01:35:56,347 --> 01:36:02,435
merely bend the structure, I believe that would
compromise the magical integrity. Usually

1984
01:36:02,435 --> 01:36:08,931
structures like this are designed for a particular
arcane reason. If we were to merely damage it,

1985
01:36:08,931 --> 01:36:12,960
Grog you could just as you do to most things.

1986
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:16,049
TRAVIS: Are you looking to me to bend it. I was
like, can you metalbend? This is awesome. But you

1987
01:36:16,049 --> 01:36:17,942
want me to get my sweet hands on it?

1988
01:36:17,942 --> 01:36:23,666
ORION: I mean, I could probably help as well,
along with Clarota, but that's an option.

1989
01:36:23,666 --> 01:36:26,097
TRAVIS: How do I get to it, though? I mean, if we
break--

1990
01:36:26,097 --> 01:36:27,043
LAURA: Flying carpet.

1991
01:36:27,043 --> 01:36:28,389
TRAVIS: No, I can't. It doesn't carry me.

1992
01:36:28,389 --> 01:36:29,784
ORION: It would only carry you.

1993
01:36:29,784 --> 01:36:34,156
MATT: It could carry a Grog and that's about it.

1994
01:36:34,156 --> 01:36:35,226
ORION: Right.

1995
01:36:35,226 --> 01:36:40,448
TRAVIS: I could be like that pilot at the end of
Independence Day that's just flying up into the--

1996
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:42,427
(laughter)

1997
01:36:42,427 --> 01:36:43,765
TRAVIS: "I'm back!"

1998
01:36:43,765 --> 01:36:45,638
LIAM: So you are Randy Quaid.

1999
01:36:45,638 --> 01:36:50,144
TRAVIS: Randy Quaid, which I've always aspired to
be. I'm in, I'll do it.

2000
01:36:50,144 --> 01:36:53,874
LIAM: Are we 100% certain there's no nooks or
crannies, or holes, or anything? We don't want to

2001
01:36:53,874 --> 01:36:55,123
go have a look?

2002
01:36:55,123 --> 01:36:56,893
SAM: Yeah, we should go have a look tomorrow
morning.

2003
01:36:56,893 --> 01:37:01,126
MARISHA: Go have a look, why? You're just going to
get caught.

2004
01:37:01,126 --> 01:37:03,173
SAM: Why? Because-- No, we're not going to get
caught.

2005
01:37:03,173 --> 01:37:05,877
LIAM: You're assuming we know everything there is
to know about this structure. About the city

2006
01:37:05,877 --> 01:37:06,826
around it.

2007
01:37:06,826 --> 01:37:12,297
TRAVIS: We're talking about a chance to
gamble with his life. Let's let him do it.

2008
01:37:12,297 --> 01:37:14,962
SAM: Yeah, we should go. We should know all we can
know.

2009
01:37:14,962 --> 01:37:18,433
MARISHA: I'm just wondering what more you're going
to find out from a flyby that I couldn't find out

2010
01:37:18,433 --> 01:37:19,719
from my vision.

2011
01:37:19,719 --> 01:37:23,158
LIAM: Well, I don't know how to tell you the
things that you don't know yet, because you don't

2012
01:37:23,158 --> 01:37:24,273
know them.

2013
01:37:24,273 --> 01:37:27,438
ORION: Hold on. Vax, are you planning on going
alone? That's silly.

2014
01:37:27,438 --> 01:37:28,553
LIAM: Take this guy.

2015
01:37:28,553 --> 01:37:29,558
ORION: That's even more silly.

2016
01:37:29,558 --> 01:37:31,102
LAURA: Because all his stealth checks lately have
been perfect.

2017
01:37:31,102 --> 01:37:33,599
LIAM: He can go invisible. We'll just take a peek.

2018
01:37:33,599 --> 01:37:35,518
ASHLEY: Should we do it? Should we nap and then
you guys go?

2019
01:37:35,590 --> 01:37:36,782
LAURA: Let's do it. Let's nap.

2020
01:37:36,782 --> 01:37:38,159
TRAVIS: Let's do it. Nap! We nap and rest.

2021
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:42,096
MATT: All right, so you guys take an evening of
rest. We'll take this as our break. Our little

2022
01:37:42,096 --> 01:37:46,361
quick ten-minute break, guys. We'll make it quick
so we can get back to this, because we have a lot

2023
01:37:46,361 --> 01:37:47,739
to try and cram into this evening.

2024
01:37:47,739 --> 01:37:49,015
LIAM: United as one!

2025
01:37:49,015 --> 01:37:52,405
MATT: So we'll see you guys shortly. Wait, do we
have a--

2026
01:37:52,405 --> 01:37:53,711
ZAC: I have a quick announcement.

2027
01:37:53,711 --> 01:37:54,529
MATT: Yes.

2028
01:37:54,529 --> 01:37:58,537
ZAC: So Malcadale-- Malhadale was the one that
sent you guys--

2029
01:37:58,537 --> 01:38:00,641
(cheering)

2030
01:38:00,641 --> 01:38:01,695
MATT: Thank you so much!

2031
01:38:01,695 --> 01:38:02,687
ASHLEY: Huzzah!

2032
01:38:02,687 --> 01:38:03,663
LAURA: I love him.

2033
01:38:03,663 --> 01:38:04,630
ORION: He sent me this?

2034
01:38:04,630 --> 01:38:05,472
TRAVIS: Grand merci.

2035
01:38:05,472 --> 01:38:06,242
MATT: Yeah.

2036
01:38:06,242 --> 01:38:08,840
ZAC: That was actually for Matt, and I wasn't
going to call it out on screen.

2037
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:09,621
ORION: Well, I'm keeping it.

2038
01:38:09,621 --> 01:38:12,975
MATT: I think you should keep it. It has a
dragon.

2039
01:38:12,975 --> 01:38:14,619
ZAC: I got in trouble for saying it was yours.

2040
01:38:14,619 --> 01:38:16,227
ORION: Yeah. That's fine.

2041
01:38:16,227 --> 01:38:18,978
MATT: I think the mouse is actually-- Keyleth, so
the staff--

2042
01:38:18,978 --> 01:38:21,587
ZAC: I'm not sure. Those were sent from-- The
mouse and the bear were sent by somebody else, so

2043
01:38:21,587 --> 01:38:26,691
just yell at me in the chatroom and tell me whose
that is. Ben Funkinator won the first giveaway.

2044
01:38:26,691 --> 01:38:27,884
TALIESIN: Yay!

2045
01:38:27,884 --> 01:38:33,160
ZAC: And we are only like 23 away from another
giveaway. And here's the thing, guys, since that

2046
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:41,771
next giveaway is at 3,000, which is a huge, huge
goal of ours, I'll give away three signed photos

2047
01:38:41,771 --> 01:38:48,297
and three signed books. Instead of one giveaway,
we'll do three giveaways to celebrate 3k. And I have

2048
01:38:48,331 --> 01:38:54,912
notified some of the troops that we could possibly
hit 3k subs, so they are on their way back to

2049
01:38:54,912 --> 01:38:59,376
dance with us tonight. Some of our people. You
guys don't have to stay, but you're more than

2050
01:38:59,376 --> 01:39:05,362
welcome to, except I was told by Erika that if we
hit 3k subs you have to dance Careless Whisper

2051
01:39:05,362 --> 01:39:09,779
with her. That's what Erika told me, she was
like--

2052
01:39:09,779 --> 01:39:11,272
TRAVIS: Without your shirt on.

2053
01:39:11,272 --> 01:39:12,730
ZAC: That has to happen if we hit 3k.

2054
01:39:12,730 --> 01:39:14,576
ORION: All right, how many are we away from that?

2055
01:39:14,576 --> 01:39:16,356
ZAC: We're only, like, 23 away.

2056
01:39:16,356 --> 01:39:18,610
ASHLEY: That's fair.

2057
01:39:18,610 --> 01:39:23,315
MATT: I will say if we're pushing to go to a dance
party after this, since this is maybe a climatic,

2058
01:39:23,315 --> 01:39:26,498
slightly overtime game, then we got to take a very
short break.

2059
01:39:26,498 --> 01:39:27,971
TRAVIS: Yeah yeah. Like five minutes max.

2060
01:39:27,971 --> 01:39:28,955
MATT AND ZAC: Five-minute break.

2061
01:39:28,955 --> 01:39:30,096
MATT: See you guys here in a second.

2062
01:39:30,096 --> 01:39:31,189
ORION: Let's go.

2063
01:39:31,189 --> 01:40:38,119
[dramatic music]

2064
01:40:38,196 --> 01:40:47,646
TRAVIS: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then
you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of

2065
01:40:47,646 --> 01:40:55,438
towering height and size, this barbarian has an
appetite for the two great loves in his life:

2066
01:40:55,438 --> 01:40:59,285
combat, women, and ale! (chuckle)

2067
01:40:59,285 --> 01:41:01,156
(record scratch) Wait.

2068
01:41:01,156 --> 01:41:07,720
Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often
consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes,

2069
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:11,454
colors, and (chuckle) shiny things!

2070
01:41:11,454 --> 01:41:13,135
Also ale.

2071
01:41:13,135 --> 01:41:19,020
In his early years, armed with his two-handed
great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might

2072
01:41:19,020 --> 01:41:25,478
amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd.
But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly

2073
01:41:25,478 --> 01:41:33,436
gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of
such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog

2074
01:41:33,436 --> 01:41:41,138
felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified
little thing. And his disobedience cost him

2075
01:41:41,138 --> 01:41:42,471
dearly.

2076
01:41:42,471 --> 01:41:50,855
Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his
uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die,

2077
01:41:50,855 --> 01:41:57,559
exiled from his herd. It was then that the
relative of the very gnome he fought to save,

2078
01:41:57,559 --> 01:42:05,542
saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric
named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back

2079
01:42:05,542 --> 01:42:10,920
from death's edge. And they have remained close
friends ever since.

2080
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:18,175
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire
taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying

2081
01:42:18,175 --> 01:42:23,720
Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for
lady favors.

2082
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:26,356
Also ale!

2083
01:42:27,390 --> 01:42:31,196
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth would leave
you with little information on the half-elven

2084
01:42:31,196 --> 01:42:36,069
druid. You might even think that her social
awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is

2085
01:42:36,069 --> 01:42:37,961
kind of sweet. (chuckle)

2086
01:42:37,961 --> 01:42:44,880
Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her
based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that

2087
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:50,659
unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast
waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have

2088
01:42:50,659 --> 01:42:56,003
made even the fiercest of champions pee their
pants, literally! (soft chuckle)

2089
01:42:56,003 --> 01:43:02,188
Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people,
Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and

2090
01:43:02,188 --> 01:43:07,910
the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent
duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

2091
01:43:07,910 --> 01:43:12,304
where the four elemental planes begin to bleed
with this realm.

2092
01:43:12,304 --> 01:43:17,547
Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack
for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities.

2093
01:43:17,547 --> 01:43:25,018
Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels
to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat)

2094
01:43:25,018 --> 01:43:30,825
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of
the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true

2095
01:43:30,825 --> 01:43:35,974
prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to
succeed him as the next headmaster.

2096
01:43:35,974 --> 01:43:42,209
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped
and replaced with endless spell memorization,

2097
01:43:42,209 --> 01:43:48,293
teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly
high expectations. Every druid leader to be must

2098
01:43:48,293 --> 01:43:53,276
embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes
in order to introduce and establish respect

2099
01:43:53,276 --> 01:44:00,667
amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt

2100
01:44:00,667 --> 01:44:07,021
she was ready, he set her on the path to truly
discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she

2101
01:44:07,021 --> 01:44:08,501
will ever return.

2102
01:44:08,501 --> 01:44:13,908
As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben,
she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the

2103
01:44:13,908 --> 01:44:20,166
Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a
valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate

2104
01:44:20,166 --> 01:44:29,199
leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on
repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?

2105
01:44:31,427 --> 01:44:35,783
TALIESIN: Percy was the third of seven children,
born to a noble family who lived far to the north

2106
01:44:35,783 --> 01:44:41,851
in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many
siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy

2107
01:44:41,851 --> 01:44:46,541
turned his attentions to the sciences,
engineering, and naturalism.

2108
01:44:46,541 --> 01:44:52,917
One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady
Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in

2109
01:44:52,917 --> 01:44:58,869
their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control
of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who

2110
01:44:58,869 --> 01:45:01,079
would stand in their way.

2111
01:45:01,079 --> 01:45:06,444
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be
freed by his younger sister. Together they fled,

2112
01:45:06,444 --> 01:45:12,538
chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran,
Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest

2113
01:45:12,538 --> 01:45:19,013
and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping
into a freezing river and floating unconscious to

2114
01:45:19,013 --> 01:45:24,544
freedom. He did not remember waking up on a
fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two

2115
01:45:24,544 --> 01:45:28,959
years, as he slowly made his way as far south as
possible.

2116
01:45:28,959 --> 01:45:35,468
Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud
of smoke offered him vengeance against those who

2117
01:45:35,468 --> 01:45:43,397
destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began
to design his first gun. (gunshot)

2118
01:45:45,136 --> 01:45:50,221
ASHLEY: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town,
near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family

2119
01:45:50,221 --> 01:45:56,035
of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable
reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery

2120
01:45:56,035 --> 01:46:02,298
left them with the curse of the last name
Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and

2121
01:46:02,298 --> 01:46:07,148
redemption, had other plans for Pike's
great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his

2122
01:46:07,237 --> 01:46:13,638
family at a young age after a dream: a dream that
changed the course of the Trickfoot family.

2123
01:46:13,638 --> 01:46:18,983
Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged
from then on that him and his family would live a

2124
01:46:18,983 --> 01:46:21,425
life of service and devotion.

2125
01:46:21,425 --> 01:46:28,576
As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to
heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even

2126
01:46:28,576 --> 01:46:34,718
flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making
things whole that had once been broken. She

2127
01:46:34,718 --> 01:46:38,276
studied and learned the ways to heal though divine
magic.

2128
01:46:38,276 --> 01:46:44,800
She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until
one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by

2129
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:50,069
a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths
took a stand against the murder of the innocent

2130
01:46:50,069 --> 01:46:57,293
gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and
left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went

2131
01:46:57,293 --> 01:47:04,207
to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this
barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life.

2132
01:47:04,207 --> 01:47:06,116
When he awoke--

2133
01:47:06,116 --> 01:48:13,400
[dramatic music]

2134
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:15,342
MATT: Welcome back!

2135
01:48:15,342 --> 01:48:18,939
ZAC: Cool. Good game. Good game, bro.

2136
01:48:18,939 --> 01:48:21,452
MATT: Yeah, we hit 3,000 on the break!

2137
01:48:21,452 --> 01:48:23,372
(cheering)

2138
01:48:23,372 --> 01:48:32,726
ZAC: Yeah, that's impressive! You guys are
awesome! So to enter in the giveaway you just have

2139
01:48:32,726 --> 01:48:38,783
to be active in the chatroom. It could be as
simple as just posting: 'I love Zac, he's great!'

2140
01:48:38,783 --> 01:48:39,900
That's all you have to write.

2141
01:48:39,900 --> 01:48:43,040
LAURA: Or Vex. Whoever.

2142
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:47,447
ZAC: Or other people in the show, it's fine,
whatever. So just be active in the chat room. I'm

2143
01:48:47,447 --> 01:48:50,354
going to go! I'm going to let these guys do their
thing. I don't want to give you guys any more

2144
01:48:50,354 --> 01:48:56,344
interruptions until the show is over, so enjoy.
Just watch the chat room for giveaways! Thank you!

2145
01:48:56,344 --> 01:49:06,156
MATT: So, back to the game at hand. You all, after
an evening of taking turns resting the best you

2146
01:49:06,156 --> 01:49:13,447
can, nothing catches your eye, although
occasionally you see a little bit of movement,

2147
01:49:13,447 --> 01:49:21,245
very slow movement just outside of your main light
radius along the edge of the top of the pit you

2148
01:49:21,317 --> 01:49:27,523
guys slept in. Just kind of fade in and out,
something just drifted away. Eventually you all

2149
01:49:27,523 --> 01:49:36,011
come to. Your Fomorian friend is just sitting
there in a very unfriendly, aggressively passive

2150
01:49:36,011 --> 01:49:40,575
manner, just staring at the rest of the group.
Expectantly.

2151
01:49:40,575 --> 01:49:44,127
TRAVIS: I offer him a sip from the cask of ale.

2152
01:49:44,127 --> 01:49:47,228
MATT: He takes it in his hand. Which to him looks
like a small mug.

2153
01:49:47,228 --> 01:49:49,031
TRAVIS: Right, just a sip.

2154
01:49:49,031 --> 01:49:50,765
LAURA: Oh, he's going to drink the whole cask
down?

2155
01:49:50,765 --> 01:49:52,123
ASHLEY: He's going to drink the whole cask.

2156
01:49:52,123 --> 01:49:53,510
MATT: He peels the top of it off, breaking the
wood.

2157
01:49:53,510 --> 01:49:54,840
TRAVIS: Don't do this to me. Don't do it.

2158
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:55,685
MATT: (gulps)

2159
01:49:55,685 --> 01:49:56,991
TRAVIS: I will fucking kill you!

2160
01:49:56,991 --> 01:49:59,201
MATT: (shattering noise)

2161
01:49:59,201 --> 01:50:00,219
LAURA: Oh!

2162
01:50:00,219 --> 01:50:02,903
TRAVIS: I would like--

2163
01:50:02,903 --> 01:50:07,278
ALL: Grog! No no no!

2164
01:50:07,278 --> 01:50:09,467
ASHLEY: Grog, we'll give you a whole thing of it!

2165
01:50:09,467 --> 01:50:11,476
LAURA: He's so happy!

2166
01:50:11,476 --> 01:50:19,521
ORION: Look, Grog! And I cast Prestidigitation and
I make fart noises. (fart noises)

2167
01:50:19,521 --> 01:50:21,534
LAURA: Oh look! He's farting!

2168
01:50:21,534 --> 01:50:22,869
ORION: Oh look, I'm farting!

2169
01:50:22,869 --> 01:50:24,176
LIAM: Scanlan, start tap dancing!

2170
01:50:24,176 --> 01:50:26,822
MARISHA: Oh no!

2171
01:50:26,822 --> 01:50:29,322
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

2172
01:50:29,322 --> 01:50:30,919
ASHLEY: Grog, are you crying?

2173
01:50:30,919 --> 01:50:38,876
TRAVIS: (grunts) 12!

2174
01:50:38,876 --> 01:50:44,733
MATT: Should you choose to, you manage to resist
the urge to fly into a rage and smash your axe

2175
01:50:44,733 --> 01:50:47,488
into the face of this entity.

2176
01:50:47,488 --> 01:50:49,024
ORION: (makes fart noises)

2177
01:50:49,024 --> 01:50:50,616
MATT: You bite your lips, you can taste the blood
in your mouth.

2178
01:50:50,616 --> 01:50:55,727
LAURA: Oh Tiberius! Some farts! Look at those
farts!

2179
01:50:55,727 --> 01:50:57,651
ORION: I figured he'd like that.

2180
01:50:57,651 --> 01:51:00,618
TRAVIS: I run up his fat chest and I headbutt him
in the face!

2181
01:51:00,618 --> 01:51:01,510
SAM: Oh shit!

2182
01:51:01,510 --> 01:51:06,178
MATT: Okay!

2183
01:51:06,178 --> 01:51:09,221
TRAVIS: It's my cask of ale!

2184
01:51:09,221 --> 01:51:15,401
MATT: As Grog rushes up in a blur of angry motion,
you see a trail of froth in the corners of his

2185
01:51:15,401 --> 01:51:20,958
mouth as his head comes colliding into the giant.
I'm going to say for this, go ahead and make an

2186
01:51:20,958 --> 01:51:22,135
athletics check.

2187
01:51:22,135 --> 01:51:25,279
LIAM: Tune in for the beholder fight three
weeks from today!

2188
01:51:25,494 --> 01:51:26,722
TRAVIS: Natural 20!

2189
01:51:26,722 --> 01:51:27,837
ASHLEY: Oh shit.

2190
01:51:27,837 --> 01:51:29,628
MATT: Can you check for me?

2191
01:51:29,628 --> 01:51:31,141
ASHLEY: That is a natural 20.

2192
01:51:31,141 --> 01:51:35,544
TRAVIS: You don't fuck with Grog's cask of ale!

2193
01:51:35,544 --> 01:51:36,984
ASHLEY: Clerics don't lie.

2194
01:51:36,984 --> 01:51:38,812
SAM: Oh God, that's our giant.

2195
01:51:38,812 --> 01:51:41,082
LIAM: He's being true to himself.

2196
01:51:41,082 --> 01:51:42,725
ASHLEY: And he's dead.

2197
01:51:42,725 --> 01:51:45,549
TRAVIS: Hey, it might be like a Fomorian thing! He
might like it!

2198
01:51:45,549 --> 01:51:47,040
MARISHA: Oh God. Can I do something?

2199
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:55,658
MATT: So, as Grog runs up, full-force angrily
slams his goliath-skull into this large Fomorian

2200
01:51:55,658 --> 01:52:04,132
Underdark giant, you hear what sounds like a clap
of thunder nearby, and you swear for a second, one

2201
01:52:04,132 --> 01:52:11,201
of the two heads are about to crack or explode
from the sheer force of the impact. You see Grog,

2202
01:52:11,201 --> 01:52:17,979
whose head is approximately a fifth the size of
this entity, has hit it with force so strong that

2203
01:52:17,979 --> 01:52:23,059
in that breathless moment you're waiting for Grog
to scream out in pain with blood pouring down his

2204
01:52:23,059 --> 01:52:30,534
face. However, it is the Fomorian who reels back
from the force of the blow, his giant eye closing

2205
01:52:30,534 --> 01:52:39,302
in severe pain before he falls onto his back.
Stunned. (groans)

2206
01:52:39,302 --> 01:52:44,759
TRAVIS: You owe me a cask of ale.

2207
01:52:44,759 --> 01:52:50,309
MATT: As Grog stands over staring down at it, it's
only partially reminiscent-- and in your fury you

2208
01:52:50,309 --> 01:53:01,232
didn't realize that you shouted at it in Giant. It
looks up at you and gives you a nod of momentary

2209
01:53:01,232 --> 01:53:09,189
submission, as you step off of its body onto the
ground walking away extremely furious.

2210
01:53:09,189 --> 01:53:13,639
TRAVIS: I'm grieving now. Leave me be.

2211
01:53:13,639 --> 01:53:16,748
LAURA: Oh my God.

2212
01:53:16,748 --> 01:53:19,078
MATT: Well, that happened.

2213
01:53:19,078 --> 01:53:20,228
ASHLEY: Amazing.

2214
01:53:20,228 --> 01:53:22,014
LIAM: Crisis averted.

2215
01:53:22,014 --> 01:53:25,055
ASHLEY: I go over and pat him on the shoulder.

2216
01:53:25,055 --> 01:53:26,768
TRAVIS: (tearfully) My cask of ale!

2217
01:53:26,768 --> 01:53:29,911
ASHLEY: It's okay, Grog! I'll get you ten casks of
ale!

2218
01:53:30,002 --> 01:53:31,185
TRAVIS: All right.

2219
01:53:31,185 --> 01:53:32,768
ASHLEY: Once we-- If we live.

2220
01:53:32,768 --> 01:53:35,309
TRAVIs: I have allergies down here.

2221
01:53:35,309 --> 01:53:38,234
ORION: I pick up a piece of the cask, I take my
wheel out (whizzing noises).

2222
01:53:38,234 --> 01:53:39,551
LAURA: What are you doing?

2223
01:53:39,551 --> 01:53:41,027
LIAM: He's mending the cask.

2224
01:53:41,027 --> 01:53:42,745
MATT: The Mending Wheel continues its process.

2225
01:53:42,816 --> 01:53:44,665
TRAVIS: I've had that cask for two years, man!

2226
01:53:44,665 --> 01:53:49,743
MATT: The Mending Wheel completely forms it into a
pure, untouched, perfect, empty cask.

2227
01:53:49,743 --> 01:53:52,620
TRAVIS: Thank you, Tiberius.

2228
01:53:52,620 --> 01:53:54,876
SAM: We will fill that cask with ale.

2229
01:53:54,876 --> 01:53:58,947
LIAM: There's your woobie. You can sleep again.

2230
01:53:58,947 --> 01:54:00,472
SAM: This is a promise cask.

2231
01:54:00,472 --> 01:54:04,755
TRAVIS: Thank you. Woobie it is. Henceforth it
shall be called Woobie.

2232
01:54:04,755 --> 01:54:06,343
LAURA: Good Job, Tiberius.

2233
01:54:06,343 --> 01:54:09,847
ORION: I was trying to tell you that before you
hit the creature, but it worked out.

2234
01:54:09,847 --> 01:54:16,086
SAM: All right, shall some of us stealth ahead to
the temple to see what we can see or should we set

2235
01:54:16,086 --> 01:54:17,517
out on foot as well?

2236
01:54:17,517 --> 01:54:18,945
LAURA: Wait! Do you want to do his foot first?

2237
01:54:18,945 --> 01:54:20,160
LIAM: I was just about to say, does this look
normal to you?

2238
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:21,331
LAURA: (groans) Oh, come on!

2239
01:54:21,331 --> 01:54:23,903
(laughter)

2240
01:54:23,903 --> 01:54:27,851
LIAM: You know, I've got a lot of flexibility back
and it feels stronger, but it doesn't look quite right.

2241
01:54:27,851 --> 01:54:29,022
LAURA: It looks disgusting!

2242
01:54:29,022 --> 01:54:31,314
ASHLEY: All right! All right! Let's do it! So I
have to roll medicine?

2243
01:54:31,314 --> 01:54:34,106
MATT: You roll medicine and what level healing you
want to use.

2244
01:54:34,106 --> 01:54:36,335
ASHLEY: We're going to rest?

2245
01:54:36,335 --> 01:54:38,627
MATT: You guys just rested. Everyone's spells are
back at full.

2246
01:54:38,627 --> 01:54:40,262
ASHLEY: Oh, we just rested. Shit.

2247
01:54:40,262 --> 01:54:44,829
MATT: Just keep in mind what spells you want to
have prepared, and keep in mind what may be ahead

2248
01:54:44,829 --> 01:54:47,928
of you. So be sparing, I recommend.

2249
01:54:47,928 --> 01:54:49,142
LAURA: Ugh, get it out of my face!

2250
01:54:49,142 --> 01:54:50,977
SAM: Yeah, it's just a foot. Don't go crazy with
it, Pike.

2251
01:54:50,977 --> 01:54:52,998
LIAM: I just want to be able to sneak better.

2252
01:54:52,998 --> 01:54:55,519
ASHLEY: How do we know how much is left on-- We
don't?

2253
01:54:55,519 --> 01:54:59,041
MATT: It looks like it's had advancement.

2254
01:54:59,041 --> 01:55:01,335
LIAM: This is like the fourth time we've done
this.

2255
01:55:01,335 --> 01:55:04,108
ASHLEY: So, 20 for medicine.

2256
01:55:04,108 --> 01:55:05,511
MATT: Rolled 20 for medicine?

2257
01:55:05,511 --> 01:55:06,328
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2258
01:55:06,328 --> 01:55:11,354
MATT: All right, and what level healing spell are
you going to use? Just keep in mind the battle you

2259
01:55:11,354 --> 01:55:12,557
may have ahead of you.

2260
01:55:12,557 --> 01:55:17,151
ASHLEY: I know. Shit, I don't know what level to
do it at. Since we're going to the whole thing.

2261
01:55:17,151 --> 01:55:18,529
LAURA: Do it level one.

2262
01:55:18,529 --> 01:55:19,874
ASHLEY: Level one?

2263
01:55:19,874 --> 01:55:22,698
LAURA: Sorry, brother.

2264
01:55:22,698 --> 01:55:24,163
MATT: So 1d8 plus five.

2265
01:55:24,163 --> 01:55:25,144
ASHLEY: All right.

2266
01:55:25,144 --> 01:55:26,726
MATT: Mark off a level one spell casting.

2267
01:55:26,726 --> 01:55:27,937
LAURA: It's almost healed.

2268
01:55:27,937 --> 01:55:29,609
ASHLEY: I'm sorry.

2269
01:55:29,609 --> 01:55:34,093
LAURA: We got a big battle, brother. Shouldn't
have fallen asleep in that--

2270
01:55:34,093 --> 01:55:35,301
ASHLEY: Ten.

2271
01:55:35,301 --> 01:55:41,855
MATT: Okay. So, that, and the medicine check, part
of the scarring from the lava burns that still

2272
01:55:41,855 --> 01:55:50,481
remains, begin to heal over. Most of the scars are
gone. You're on the cusp of getting past your

2273
01:55:50,481 --> 01:55:53,162
disadvantage, but not quite yet.

2274
01:55:53,162 --> 01:55:56,027
LIAM: It's not nothing.

2275
01:55:56,027 --> 01:55:59,485
LAURA: Sorry, your nubbin lives.

2276
01:55:59,485 --> 01:56:02,513
MATT: All right. What's the plan?

2277
01:56:02,513 --> 01:56:05,397
SAM: Yes, what is the plan? Are some of us setting
out on foot or are we just sending--

2278
01:56:05,397 --> 01:56:07,685
TRAVIS: Yes. The stealthiest of the stealthy go.

2279
01:56:07,685 --> 01:56:08,731
SAM: On foot.

2280
01:56:08,731 --> 01:56:10,509
LAURA: No no no. On the carpet.

2281
01:56:10,509 --> 01:56:11,649
SAM: On the carpet, okay.

2282
01:56:11,649 --> 01:56:14,693
TRAVIS: Yeah. A little recon and then we--

2283
01:56:14,693 --> 01:56:15,869
SAM: Just recon.

2284
01:56:15,869 --> 01:56:16,855
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2285
01:56:16,855 --> 01:56:17,961
SAM: All right, I'm with you.

2286
01:56:17,961 --> 01:56:24,334
MARISHA: I go ahead and cast Enhance Ability for
dexterity on Scanlan over here.

2287
01:56:24,334 --> 01:56:26,545
SAM: What does it do?

2288
01:56:26,545 --> 01:56:28,527
MATT: Gives you advantage on your dexterity
checks.

2289
01:56:28,527 --> 01:56:30,090
TRAVIS: Is it just dexterity you can enhance, or
anything?

2290
01:56:30,090 --> 01:56:34,673
MATT: No, and skills that are dexterity-based. So
stealth would have an advantage, which is nice.

2291
01:56:34,673 --> 01:56:43,578
All right, so, we have Scanlan. There we go. Look
at these guys here on the new carpet.

2292
01:56:43,578 --> 01:56:44,809
LAURA: That's adorable.

2293
01:56:44,809 --> 01:56:46,164
MARISHA: New carpet!

2294
01:56:46,164 --> 01:56:47,688
ASHLEY: That's awesome.

2295
01:56:47,688 --> 01:56:50,621
MARISHA: It's advantage. You get to roll twice.

2296
01:56:50,621 --> 01:56:57,999
MATT: So, as you guys hold place. The two of you
drift into the air.

2297
01:56:57,999 --> 01:57:00,160
LAURA: Be careful!

2298
01:57:00,160 --> 01:57:01,370
SAM: It's just us two?

2299
01:57:01,370 --> 01:57:02,555
MATT: Just the two of you.

2300
01:57:02,555 --> 01:57:05,249
SAM: Farewell, Pike. I'll miss you.

2301
01:57:05,249 --> 01:57:06,649
ASHLEY: (sings) Goodbye my love!

2302
01:57:06,649 --> 01:57:08,580
SAM: What? My love?

2303
01:57:08,580 --> 01:57:11,393
ASHLEY: No, no. I-- Well, it's from a movie that I
saw.

2304
01:57:11,393 --> 01:57:13,831
ORION: Pike, what is a movie?

2305
01:57:13,831 --> 01:57:15,126
LIAM: Like a puppet show?

2306
01:57:15,126 --> 01:57:18,440
ASHLEY: Oh, it's just like flashing pictures that
all move together.

2307
01:57:18,440 --> 01:57:20,304
ORION: Oh, like light! Like that?

2308
01:57:20,304 --> 01:57:21,221
TRAVIS: It flashes?

2309
01:57:21,221 --> 01:57:22,165
ASHLEY: It flashes.

2310
01:57:22,165 --> 01:57:24,364
SAM: All right, off we go.

2311
01:57:24,364 --> 01:57:30,655
MATT: The two of you hop onto the carpet and begin
to slowly ride up past the treetops of the nearby

2312
01:57:30,757 --> 01:57:35,004
fungal forest. As you curve upward into the air--

2313
01:57:35,079 --> 01:57:37,516
SAM: (sings) I can show you the world.

2314
01:57:37,587 --> 01:57:42,148
MATT: -- you get a very fine view of the city
proper. You can see a lot of these buildings in

2315
01:57:42,148 --> 01:57:45,946
the outskirts of the city are rubble. They have
fallen in on themselves. They have collapsed. You

2316
01:57:45,946 --> 01:57:53,504
can see pieces of foundation and ceilings and
rooftops that have caved in. And right in the

2317
01:57:53,504 --> 01:57:59,642
center of the city is a very easy-to-see temple.
Which, in itself, is essentially a pyramid with a

2318
01:57:59,738 --> 01:58:05,211
flattened top. There is that dull, greenish glow
that seems to just slowly trickle around the very

2319
01:58:05,211 --> 01:58:12,698
top of the temple. As you are just starting to
crest over the top of the outskirts of the city

2320
01:58:12,698 --> 01:58:17,924
proper, I'd say about here. Are you guys going
over the city? Are you following the outskirts?

2321
01:58:17,924 --> 01:58:24,138
What's your plan of recon? You guys are currently
now moving this way.

2322
01:58:24,138 --> 01:58:25,452
LAURA: Plan? What's that?

2323
01:58:25,452 --> 01:58:26,825
SAM: I leave it to you.

2324
01:58:26,825 --> 01:58:31,371
LIAM: Well, we're moving pretty fast. I say we go
all around the rim of the city.

2325
01:58:31,371 --> 01:58:37,688
MATT: All right. Both of you roll stealth. With
advantage.

2326
01:58:37,688 --> 01:58:40,170
LIAM: Advantage, you said?

2327
01:58:40,170 --> 01:58:41,299
MATT: He has advantage.

2328
01:58:41,299 --> 01:58:47,371
LIAM: I got a 14.

2329
01:58:47,371 --> 01:58:48,677
SAM: 18.

2330
01:58:48,677 --> 01:58:57,783
MATT: 14, 18. Okay. So, you guys begin to crest
around, and you look down and it's very, very

2331
01:58:57,783 --> 01:59:04,960
dark. There are what looks like these greenish
spores that found pockets in the city that give

2332
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:10,785
off light. This very, very faint luminescence
within the city, and they get thicker and thicker

2333
01:59:10,785 --> 01:59:16,209
and cluster and make the center of the city more
bright and easier to make out the details of. You

2334
01:59:16,209 --> 01:59:20,239
don't know if these were placed there or if they
naturally grew there and just add the ambiance to

2335
01:59:20,462 --> 01:59:26,879
it. But what you see in that little bit of light
as you glance down are many figures walking and

2336
01:59:26,879 --> 01:59:28,027
moving through the city.

2337
01:59:28,027 --> 01:59:28,997
LIAM: What figures?

2338
01:59:28,997 --> 01:59:30,347
MATT AND SAM: Many figures.

2339
01:59:30,347 --> 01:59:39,834
MATT: You can see humanoid-sized individuals
gliding through the city. 20, 30, 50 illithid

2340
01:59:39,834 --> 01:59:44,787
visible in one section of the city. Each carrying
two to three slaves each. Some trolls, ogres,

2341
01:59:44,787 --> 01:59:47,931
other dwarves, other creatures of the Underdark
that at this distance you cannot make out their

2342
01:59:47,931 --> 01:59:55,727
form, but there is, essentially, a thriving
community down here of mind flayers. Some of them,

2343
01:59:55,727 --> 01:59:59,935
it's hard to tell where they're going but there
are some going to and from the temple carrying

2344
01:59:59,935 --> 02:00:07,644
small satchels or boxes. As they glide-- Or,
actually, they wouldn't be carrying it. Their

2345
02:00:07,644 --> 02:00:13,157
slaves would be carrying for them and they're
keeping alongside them. As you continue around the

2346
02:00:13,228 --> 02:00:19,544
side here, you start getting more into the ruined
area and this part of the town itself, on this

2347
02:00:19,544 --> 02:00:28,862
side, is mostly nonfunctional. It's abandoned and
you can see the repurposed city construction by

2348
02:00:28,862 --> 02:00:33,010
this colony has started in the center and over the
past few hundred years or as long as it's been

2349
02:00:33,010 --> 02:00:39,490
here, it's slowly building and repairing outward.
As you crest around this side, you can see a far

2350
02:00:39,490 --> 02:00:45,205
ruin about another half mile to a mile off from
where you are, too far away to catch any details

2351
02:00:45,205 --> 02:00:52,893
of it. You cruise around this side, and you hear
this squeaking sound, this (squeaks), and you

2352
02:00:52,893 --> 02:00:59,304
glance up, and you see what looks like a cluster
of bats moving to the top of the cavern. They're

2353
02:00:59,304 --> 02:01:04,506
almost buzzing you guys in the head, up above,
ten, 20 feet ahead of you, they're just coming

2354
02:01:04,506 --> 02:01:06,549
back and forth over you.

2355
02:01:06,549 --> 02:01:09,208
TRAVIS: Sentries?

2356
02:01:09,208 --> 02:01:11,680
ASHLEY: Yeah, sentry bats.

2357
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:15,281
MATT: You guys take it a little lower to kind of
get away from that. Eventually the bats stop

2358
02:01:15,281 --> 02:01:20,612
harrowing you. You find your way back around. Come
to rest back at the camp.

2359
02:01:20,612 --> 02:01:23,869
LAURA: Well?

2360
02:01:23,869 --> 02:01:27,588
LIAM: And just to clarify, the part where we saw
all the illithid figures was

2361
02:01:27,588 --> 02:01:30,030
on the opposite side, right?

2362
02:01:30,030 --> 02:01:35,464
MATT: It was around this section, here. You saw,
in this portion of the city, which is the only one

2363
02:01:35,464 --> 02:01:40,244
example. The best you can see around this, this
whole intersection right around the temple is

2364
02:01:40,244 --> 02:01:47,580
pretty fairly populated with mind flayers and
their slaves.

2365
02:01:47,580 --> 02:01:50,576
LIAM: (voice breaks) So the--

2366
02:01:50,576 --> 02:01:52,065
TRAVIS: Puberty's a bitch.

2367
02:01:52,065 --> 02:01:54,668
LIAM: (voice breaks) Yes. Well, I'm only 62.

2368
02:01:54,668 --> 02:01:59,634
SAM: We need that big brain on our side?

2369
02:01:59,634 --> 02:02:06,790
LIAM: Yeah, the city is crawling with illithid.
But more on the northern edge, not so much here on

2370
02:02:06,790 --> 02:02:09,598
the side. And it's a lot. It's not a few, it's a
lot.

2371
02:02:09,598 --> 02:02:12,686
LAURA: It's a city. We need the Elder Brain.

2372
02:02:12,686 --> 02:02:17,389
LIAM: We need a distraction, though. That's the
only thing I took away from what we saw.

2373
02:02:17,389 --> 02:02:20,466
SAM: Unless we all go in from the top.

2374
02:02:20,466 --> 02:02:24,054
TRAVIS: Tiny and I had a meeting of the minds. We
could provide a distraction.

2375
02:02:24,054 --> 02:02:26,525
LAURA: You wanna go against illithid?

2376
02:02:26,525 --> 02:02:28,336
TRAVIS: I don't give a shit.

2377
02:02:28,336 --> 02:02:31,897
TALIESIN: He does not want to go against
illithid.

2378
02:02:31,897 --> 02:02:33,803
TRAVIS: Chaotic Neutral, baby!

2379
02:02:33,803 --> 02:02:36,280
LIAM: Yeah, but they're going to take you over,
big guy.

2380
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:37,900
LAURA: They'll take you over and then we'll fight
you.

2381
02:02:37,900 --> 02:02:43,435
LIAM: Here's what I think is better. We take Tiny,
transform him into a mouse. We fly over, just when

2382
02:02:43,435 --> 02:02:50,386
we're over the right part of the city, flick him
in the mouse nuts, and toss him off. And then let

2383
02:02:50,386 --> 02:02:57,561
him turn him back into Tiny, as he falls into a
pile of illithid and keeps them busy. We need to

2384
02:02:57,561 --> 02:03:01,555
draw as much attention away from the beholder as
possible.

2385
02:03:01,555 --> 02:03:02,791
LAURA: I like it.

2386
02:03:02,791 --> 02:03:04,081
TALIESIN AND MARISHA: I like it.

2387
02:03:04,081 --> 02:03:05,787
SAM: What will we be doing in the meantime?

2388
02:03:05,787 --> 02:03:09,122
LAURA: We'll be going in over the top, trying to
get rid of the thing controlling the Elder Brain.

2389
02:03:09,122 --> 02:03:11,063
ORION: We do not want that.

2390
02:03:11,063 --> 02:03:13,040
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's going to be collateral
damage.

2391
02:03:13,040 --> 02:03:16,160
ORION: No, I like the first half of that idea,
Vax.

2392
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:17,571
LIAM: The nut-flicking part?

2393
02:03:17,571 --> 02:03:23,387
ORION: No. That idea will work as well, too. I
think what we should do is do the mouse thing.

2394
02:03:23,387 --> 02:03:30,931
Whoever-- I guess we make the effort to go in,
however we can manage, to get into the top of

2395
02:03:30,931 --> 02:03:37,093
wherever we are going to attack those beams, as it
were, to do damage to the thing controlling

2396
02:03:37,093 --> 02:03:38,064
whatever.

2397
02:03:38,064 --> 02:03:39,230
LAURA: Yes?

2398
02:03:39,230 --> 02:03:45,798
ORION: That's when we should lightly drop him in
as a mouse. Because when this takes enough damage,

2399
02:03:45,798 --> 02:03:52,004
which he should, as a mouse, the spell will wear
off. And he would poof back into whatever. We

2400
02:03:52,004 --> 02:03:54,047
should do it right on the beholder.

2401
02:03:54,047 --> 02:03:56,464
LAURA: Actually, I agree with that.

2402
02:03:56,464 --> 02:04:00,638
ORION: Because that, I think, would be more a
distraction for the creature. A beast against a

2403
02:04:00,638 --> 02:04:02,600
nasty beast is always a good fight.

2404
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:07,194
LAURA: If he's being controlled by you, can he not
be controlled by another being?

2405
02:04:07,194 --> 02:04:11,669
MARISHA: It probably would be a contest of wills.

2406
02:04:11,669 --> 02:04:15,356
LIAM: And he could turn the thing on us pretty
easily, I'm willing to believe.

2407
02:04:15,356 --> 02:04:18,817
MARISHA: Well, what if we-- How about this, why
don't we turn him into a mouse and we can just

2408
02:04:18,817 --> 02:04:25,054
keep him as our, you know, emergency pocket mouse,
and whenever, if we need a quick distraction, then

2409
02:04:25,054 --> 02:04:28,333
we flick him in his mouse nuts and drop him over
and--

2410
02:04:28,333 --> 02:04:30,152
TALIESIN: His poor mouse nuts.

2411
02:04:30,152 --> 02:04:31,484
LAURA: I like it.

2412
02:04:31,484 --> 02:04:34,516
ORION: We need all the people in the town alive.
Clarota will be upset if we hurt anybody and we

2413
02:04:34,516 --> 02:04:42,370
need their aid. I suggest, because I have a
feeling that because this is his lair, he will

2414
02:04:42,370 --> 02:04:50,529
have, and I'm talking about K'Varn, he will have
advantages that we do not understand. If we go in.

2415
02:04:50,529 --> 02:04:51,884
And we will have disadvantages.

2416
02:04:51,884 --> 02:04:52,998
TRAVIS: We don't want to go in.

2417
02:04:52,998 --> 02:04:53,973
ORION: Exactly.

2418
02:04:53,973 --> 02:04:56,648
LIAM: We're all open to an idea to get him out.
Have you got one?

2419
02:04:56,648 --> 02:05:02,751
ORION: I'm saying, that is why. So if we threw our
rather large friend here in, and do the thing,

2420
02:05:02,751 --> 02:05:09,475
that will get us control and Clarota can help us
manage everyone in the town.

2421
02:05:09,475 --> 02:05:11,165
Even the slaves will rally.

2422
02:05:11,165 --> 02:05:13,689
LAURA: They don't like Clarota. They aren't going
to listen to Clarota, especially if they're

2423
02:05:13,689 --> 02:05:15,250
controlled by another being.

2424
02:05:15,250 --> 02:05:16,787
TRAVIS: Yeah, they did exile him.

2425
02:05:16,787 --> 02:05:20,009
MATT: Clarota puts the thought in your mind
immediately, basically, this very strong

2426
02:05:20,009 --> 02:05:26,951
realization that, "Without the town freed, I have
no leverage with my people."

2427
02:05:26,951 --> 02:05:30,582
ORION: That's what I'm saying. After we've
destroyed the mechanism.

2428
02:05:30,582 --> 02:05:32,127
TALIESIN: Yes, that's the plan.

2429
02:05:32,127 --> 02:05:33,622
MARISHA: After we've destroyed the mechanism,
yeah.

2430
02:05:33,622 --> 02:05:35,503
ORION: Right. That's why we cannot attack the
town.

2431
02:05:35,503 --> 02:05:38,042
TRAVIS: So are we saying we want to go up to the
top, we want to try and weaken the cross with the

2432
02:05:38,042 --> 02:05:45,773
yellow and the acid, we want to drop Titmouse, the
giant, on the thing, hopefully, if it breaks. If

2433
02:05:45,773 --> 02:05:50,390
it doesn't break, then what do we do?

2434
02:05:50,390 --> 02:05:51,632
SAM: We Rage.

2435
02:05:51,632 --> 02:05:53,267
(laughter)

2436
02:05:53,267 --> 02:05:58,142
LIAM: And also, I don't understand, we're talking
about crashing the thing. But aren't we risking,

2437
02:05:58,142 --> 02:06:04,058
at least, risking dropping the upside-down pyramid
onto the Elder Brain?

2438
02:06:04,058 --> 02:06:05,739
MARISHA: That's why I was saying if we can--

2439
02:06:05,739 --> 02:06:07,333
LAURA: We're going to tie a chain to it.

2440
02:06:07,333 --> 02:06:12,073
MARISHA: I think if we tie a chain to it, I think
we break the beams and then air-evac it out,

2441
02:06:12,073 --> 02:06:13,842
personally.

2442
02:06:13,842 --> 02:06:15,423
TALIESIN: I think it might be too heavy.

2443
02:06:15,423 --> 02:06:17,529
SAM: Evacuate it via air.

2444
02:06:17,529 --> 02:06:22,711
LAURA: I feel like that uses way more time because
what's going to happen is once it happens, it's

2445
02:06:22,711 --> 02:06:26,674
all going to go to shit. So once we drop it, we
should probably just fucking go.

2446
02:06:26,674 --> 02:06:30,336
MARISHA: Well then, how about this? Why don't we
concentrate, instead of-- Because okay, it's a

2447
02:06:30,336 --> 02:06:36,240
middle cross beam thing, right? Why don't, instead
of focusing on the middle section, we focus just

2448
02:06:36,240 --> 02:06:39,897
on two sides, so it goes.

2449
02:06:39,897 --> 02:06:41,404
TALIESIN: That's a good idea.

2450
02:06:41,404 --> 02:06:49,046
SAM: May I throw a wrinkle into things? Those bats
didn't look good. Those are eyes that he's using

2451
02:06:49,046 --> 02:06:55,280
to watch things above. So we gotta get through the
bats first. Or distract the bats, or get rid of

2452
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:56,646
the bats.

2453
02:06:56,646 --> 02:07:01,114
ORION: Bats will be a problem. Bats catch fire
rather quickly, if I recall.

2454
02:07:01,114 --> 02:07:04,636
LAURA: Maybe, Keyleth, you could turn into a bat
and tell them all to go a different direction.

2455
02:07:04,636 --> 02:07:09,711
MARISHA: I can talk to the bats or I can Dominate
a bat. I could talk to the bats.

2456
02:07:09,711 --> 02:07:12,061
TALIESIN: This is assuming the bats are going to
be a problem.

2457
02:07:12,061 --> 02:07:15,107
LAURA: If it comes up, we'll deal with it. How
about that?

2458
02:07:15,107 --> 02:07:16,883
MARISHA: I'll make sure I can talk to the bats.

2459
02:07:16,883 --> 02:07:18,227
TALIESIN: I'm not afraid of bats.

2460
02:07:18,227 --> 02:07:20,930
SAM: No no no. The bats will ruin our element of
surprise.

2461
02:07:20,930 --> 02:07:22,789
LAURA: None of this is a surprise.

2462
02:07:22,789 --> 02:07:24,534
TALIESIN: Do we have, really, an element of
surprise at this point?

2463
02:07:24,534 --> 02:07:26,740
LAURA: None of it's a surprise. He knows we're
here.

2464
02:07:26,740 --> 02:07:27,666
ASHLEY: Onward, ho?

2465
02:07:27,666 --> 02:07:28,802
TALIESIN: Onward, ho.

2466
02:07:28,802 --> 02:07:30,408
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

2467
02:07:30,408 --> 02:07:32,590
SAM: We don't even know what we're doing.

2468
02:07:32,590 --> 02:07:34,648
TRAVIS: Quit tip-toeing into the ocean, let's run
into this.

2469
02:07:34,648 --> 02:07:40,134
MATT: Kima has finished wrapping the leather on
the handle of the great maul that she's holding.

2470
02:07:40,134 --> 02:07:44,541
Grasps it in her hands, her armor freshly polished
after waking up this morning. Looks at the rest of

2471
02:07:44,541 --> 02:07:51,061
you and says, "Are you ready to walk into the
great halls of the warrior minds before us?"

2472
02:07:51,061 --> 02:07:52,821
ORION AND MARISHA: No.

2473
02:07:52,821 --> 02:07:58,324
ASHLEY: Do you have any ideas, real quick. Or were
you hearing anything we were saying? Kima? I just

2474
02:07:58,324 --> 02:08:01,739
mean there's a lot of ideas thrown out, but do you
have any idea, specifically?

2475
02:08:01,739 --> 02:08:03,788
TALIESIN: Do you have anything to contribute?

2476
02:08:03,788 --> 02:08:08,341
MATT: Kima looks at you for a second, and pulls
her own holy symbol out and says, "The guidance of

2477
02:08:08,341 --> 02:08:16,270
"Bahamut has not steered me astray, as of yet. And
your deity also has brought you down here for a

2478
02:08:16,270 --> 02:08:22,469
"great cause. I think, as long as they're both
looking over us, and we are straight and true with

2479
02:08:22,469 --> 02:08:28,545
"our intent, we shall be fine. As far as the
tactics, they seem sound, as long as we can

2480
02:08:28,545 --> 02:08:34,320
"maintain the element of surprise. I feel that if
that is given up, we may have to improvise.

2481
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:36,516
"Improvisation scares me."

2482
02:08:36,516 --> 02:08:37,988
LAURA: Okay, okay.

2483
02:08:37,988 --> 02:08:43,635
MATT: "So everything we can possibly do to
maintain a very quiet arrival is going to be the

2484
02:08:43,635 --> 02:08:46,554
"key to success in this."

2485
02:08:46,554 --> 02:08:49,574
SAM: So that's either a distraction or taking care
of bats.

2486
02:08:49,574 --> 02:08:54,053
MARISHA: I mean, I could Fog Cloud us. We could
look like a big, floating cloud.

2487
02:08:54,053 --> 02:08:57,018
SAM: Yeah, but if we float, then we're going to
float right through the fog.

2488
02:08:57,018 --> 02:09:03,938
LAURA: What if we use a giant net and two of us
get up on the carpet and we use a big net and

2489
02:09:03,938 --> 02:09:07,011
catch as many bats as we can.

2490
02:09:07,011 --> 02:09:09,119
MATT: "Does anyone have a net?"

2491
02:09:09,119 --> 02:09:10,548
LAURA: Do we have a net?

2492
02:09:10,548 --> 02:09:13,321
TALIESIN: We do have a giant piece of leather that
makes us look like rock.

2493
02:09:13,321 --> 02:09:17,895
SAM: Grog had Annette, back in Emon. She was
great.

2494
02:09:17,895 --> 02:09:23,493
LIAM: I still think we should drop Tiny on top of
the-- or at least, near the main illithid

2495
02:09:23,493 --> 02:09:28,134
encampment to keep them busy. K'Varn's eye will
turn there for a moment.

2496
02:09:28,134 --> 02:09:34,289
TALIESIN: We can-- And we can attach the
camouflage back onto the flying carpet.

2497
02:09:34,289 --> 02:09:36,195
SAM: We have camouflage?

2498
02:09:36,195 --> 02:09:37,574
TALIESIN: We do.

2499
02:09:37,574 --> 02:09:45,367
MATT: Clarota motions for a second and says, "We
also have to consider this temple has doorways in

2500
02:09:45,367 --> 02:09:57,990
"and out. This chamber that K'Varn has taken has
ways to be opened and outside forces in. Do we

2501
02:09:57,990 --> 02:10:05,779
"have a way to seal these entrances if we are to do
this fight, so we don't have any additional

2502
02:10:05,779 --> 02:10:07,119
"visitors?"

2503
02:10:07,119 --> 02:10:12,896
LAURA: Oh, good call. Great. Do you know where
those entrances are?

2504
02:10:12,896 --> 02:10:15,072
MATT: K'Varn thinks for a second and says--

2505
02:10:15,072 --> 02:10:17,364
LAURA: Your name's Clarota. I'm sorry.

2506
02:10:17,364 --> 02:10:30,347
MATT: "There are, if I recall, two doors to the
room. Not large."

2507
02:10:30,347 --> 02:10:32,887
TRAVIS: He doesn't need doors, right? He can make
portals and shit?

2508
02:10:32,887 --> 02:10:35,196
SAM: No no. He'll need a door to let in other
people.

2509
02:10:35,196 --> 02:10:37,595
MARISHA: Well, here's the thing are we trying to
actually-- We're not trying to get inside the

2510
02:10:37,595 --> 02:10:38,863
temple.

2511
02:10:38,863 --> 02:10:40,074
SAM: Yeah, we are.

2512
02:10:40,074 --> 02:10:43,023
TRAVIS: No, we're trying to keep him from calling
in a fucking dragon or something. He can't

2513
02:10:43,023 --> 02:10:45,254
Dimension Door in a dragon and be like, "Just
kidding."

2514
02:10:45,254 --> 02:10:47,959
TALIESIN: He can call every single creature in the
city to come to his aid.

2515
02:10:47,959 --> 02:10:49,247
TRAVIS: But he can't--

2516
02:10:49,247 --> 02:10:52,349
TALIESIN: More than enough to deal with us.

2517
02:10:52,349 --> 02:10:55,653
MATT: "Not if you damage the device."

2518
02:10:55,653 --> 02:10:57,824
LAURA: We can just drop things in from above on
the temple and stay out of the temple.

2519
02:10:57,824 --> 02:11:03,428
MATT: "If the device is damaged, he no longer has
sway over the illithid."

2520
02:11:03,428 --> 02:11:07,092
TALIESIN: So then we want people to come into the
temple at that point.

2521
02:11:07,092 --> 02:11:08,568
MATT: "Perhaps."

2522
02:11:08,568 --> 02:11:10,872
ORION: No, that's when we get out and smoke him
out.

2523
02:11:10,872 --> 02:11:16,022
TALIESIN: We're not going to set him on fire.

2524
02:11:16,022 --> 02:11:20,307
LAURA: Maybe just give up on the smoking out?

2525
02:11:20,307 --> 02:11:23,824
TRAVIS: I think hotboxing is now-- No?

2526
02:11:23,824 --> 02:11:25,335
LIAM: Yeah.

2527
02:11:25,335 --> 02:11:31,238
ASHLEY: If I were to use Divination soon, how long
does that last?

2528
02:11:31,238 --> 02:11:33,055
MATT: Divination.

2529
02:11:33,055 --> 02:11:34,826
LAURA: Is that the one where you call your deity?

2530
02:11:34,826 --> 02:11:36,383
MATT: Oh, you mean Divine Inspiration?

2531
02:11:36,383 --> 02:11:37,886
ASHLEY: Divine Inspiration, I'm sorry.

2532
02:11:37,886 --> 02:11:39,128
MATT: That happens the moment you use it.

2533
02:11:39,128 --> 02:11:40,297
ASHLEY: It happens the moment you use it.

2534
02:11:40,297 --> 02:11:41,521
MATT: Yes.

2535
02:11:41,521 --> 02:11:43,067
ASHLEY: Okay.

2536
02:11:43,067 --> 02:11:49,189
LAURA: So we would know if she's going to help us?
Or would she help us that moment?

2537
02:11:49,226 --> 02:11:53,247
MATT: It's not so much, "Hey god, come with me."
It's more like, "Please help me right now."

2538
02:11:53,247 --> 02:11:56,630
Something may happen that turns the tide.

2539
02:11:56,630 --> 02:12:01,335
ASHLEY: So is that something, just a question,
that I would do now or maybe in the battle?

2540
02:12:01,335 --> 02:12:02,681
MATT: Maybe in the battle.

2541
02:12:02,681 --> 02:12:03,615
ASHLEY: Okay.

2542
02:12:03,615 --> 02:12:05,731
MATT: Like, the moment you need the help is the
moment it will happen, most likely.

2543
02:12:05,731 --> 02:12:10,585
ASHLEY: Let's do that. All right. Just was having
a moment with god, for a minute, guys.

2544
02:12:10,585 --> 02:12:12,038
Sorry, I'm back.

2545
02:12:12,038 --> 02:12:17,557
SAM: Can we-- Before we make this journey, can we
sound off who's on what duty?

2546
02:12:17,557 --> 02:12:18,970
LAURA: Right.

2547
02:12:18,970 --> 02:12:22,349
SAM: Who's on damaging-the-device duty, who's
on--

2548
02:12:22,349 --> 02:12:25,467
TRAVIS: I could give the four acid vials to
whoever has the yellow liquid who wants that

2549
02:12:25,467 --> 02:12:26,573
responsibility.

2550
02:12:26,573 --> 02:12:27,877
TALIESIN: I'll take--

2551
02:12:27,877 --> 02:12:30,279
ASHLEY: I feel like we should use some of that,
though, for the beholder.

2552
02:12:30,279 --> 02:12:33,076
TALIESIN: I want to save as much of it for the
beholder as possible.

2553
02:12:33,076 --> 02:12:33,943
ASHLEY: Okay.

2554
02:12:33,943 --> 02:12:34,855
TRAVIS: The yellow liquid?

2555
02:12:34,855 --> 02:12:35,700
TALIESIN: Yes.

2556
02:12:35,700 --> 02:12:38,366
TRAVIS: So who wants to pour the acid on the
cross? I could do that, but it's--

2557
02:12:38,366 --> 02:12:40,542
LAURA: Percy-- Well, are you going up top?

2558
02:12:40,542 --> 02:12:42,533
TRAVIS: I'm at everybody's disposal.

2559
02:12:42,533 --> 02:12:47,378
TALIESIN: I'm going to head up top. Also, in the
fight, I'll be more use from a distance anyway.

2560
02:12:47,378 --> 02:12:50,694
SAM: Who's on the shutting-off-those-doors duty?
Is that a thing that we need to assign to

2561
02:12:50,694 --> 02:12:52,171
someone?

2562
02:12:52,171 --> 02:12:54,022
MARISHA: Could you fashion--

2563
02:12:54,022 --> 02:12:55,543
LAURA: That could be Keyleth.

2564
02:12:55,543 --> 02:12:57,718
MARIHSHA: -- like a paintball?

2565
02:12:57,718 --> 02:12:59,675
SAM: That could be you, but you're not going to be
there. You'll still stay behind?

2566
02:12:59,675 --> 02:13:02,099
LAURA: Yeah, you guys, could you guys be in charge
of closing up the entrances?

2567
02:13:02,099 --> 02:13:06,752
TALIESIN: Do we have any spare glass vials?

2568
02:13:06,752 --> 02:13:09,643
TRAVIS: We do.

2569
02:13:09,643 --> 02:13:11,338
TALIESIN: Can I have one?

2570
02:13:11,338 --> 02:13:13,681
TRAVIS: Yeah. I give him a glass vial.

2571
02:13:13,681 --> 02:13:15,943
MARISHA: Well, I'm flying people overtop, I'm
assuming.

2572
02:13:15,943 --> 02:13:19,125
TALIESIN: Can I have a spare arrow? Vex?

2573
02:13:19,125 --> 02:13:22,189
MARISHA: I think we should all be on top together.
I don't think we should try and separate.

2574
02:13:22,189 --> 02:13:25,879
TALIESIN: Can I borrow a spare arrow?

2575
02:13:25,879 --> 02:13:26,886
LAURA: Sure.

2576
02:13:26,886 --> 02:13:28,094
MARISHA: A sparrow.

2577
02:13:28,094 --> 02:13:29,040
TALIESIN: A sparrow.

2578
02:13:29,040 --> 02:13:29,846
LAURA: Here you are.

2579
02:13:29,846 --> 02:13:33,002
TALIESIN: I have a second, I want to see if I can
make a crude acid arrow out of a glass vial.

2580
02:13:33,002 --> 02:13:36,129
LAURA: Take it, give it to me after it's done.

2581
02:13:36,129 --> 02:13:37,854
TALIESIN: It's a Shatter, a straight up Shatter
arrow.

2582
02:13:37,854 --> 02:13:42,490
MATT: Because of the rushed nature of this, go
ahead and make a roll.

2583
02:13:42,490 --> 02:13:45,767
TALIESIN: It's a Proficiency bonus, plus--

2584
02:13:45,767 --> 02:13:48,745
SAM: I will inspire him.

2585
02:13:48,745 --> 02:13:50,833
TALIESIN: Thank you, please.

2586
02:13:50,833 --> 02:13:53,489
SAM: (sings) Everything is awesome!

2587
02:13:53,489 --> 02:13:56,993
SAM AND TALIESIN: (sings) Everything is cool when
you're making an arrow!

2588
02:13:56,993 --> 02:13:59,145
MATT: Roll a d10, add it to the roll.

2589
02:13:59,145 --> 02:14:02,256
TALIESIN: Ah, thank you. Oh my god.

2590
02:14:02,256 --> 02:14:03,715
MARISHA: Aw.

2591
02:14:03,715 --> 02:14:05,311
TALIESIN: Yeah, nine.

2592
02:14:05,311 --> 02:14:11,801
MATT: Nine? As you're attempting to fashion it to
the arrow, unfortunately, the vial shatters in

2593
02:14:11,801 --> 02:14:16,690
your hand. You take three points of acid damage.

2594
02:14:16,690 --> 02:14:20,773
TALIESIN: Ow. I wasn't-- Aw, I wouldn't have put
the acid in yet. Okay, fine.

2595
02:14:20,773 --> 02:14:22,949
MATT: It happens at the process of you setting it
up.

2596
02:14:22,949 --> 02:14:24,457
TALIESIN: Damn it. All right.

2597
02:14:24,457 --> 02:14:25,948
MATT: Based on the roll you made.

2598
02:14:25,948 --> 02:14:27,537
TALIESIN: I'm having bad rolls for this stuff,
man.

2599
02:14:27,537 --> 02:14:29,758
MATT: Better to get them out of the way now,
then.

2600
02:14:29,758 --> 02:14:32,866
TALIESIN: So that didn't work.

2601
02:14:32,866 --> 02:14:36,163
LAURA: Damn it. Good try. Good try, Percy.

2602
02:14:36,163 --> 02:14:38,940
MARISHA: I'm trying to figure out a way we could
just conserve the acid, like if I could--

2603
02:14:38,940 --> 02:14:40,930
TALIESIN: I'm just going to pour very gingerly.

2604
02:14:40,930 --> 02:14:42,183
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

2605
02:14:42,183 --> 02:14:43,633
TALIESIN: I'm going to just pay attention.

2606
02:14:43,633 --> 02:14:44,858
MARISHA: Okay, try it gingerly.

2607
02:14:44,858 --> 02:14:46,535
SAM: And when he attacks us, what do we do?

2608
02:14:46,535 --> 02:14:49,183
LAURA: Okay, yes. Good-- Good thinking.

2609
02:14:49,183 --> 02:14:51,507
MARISHA: Are we going to fight him now or are we
going to try and run? Are we going to try and lure

2610
02:14:51,507 --> 02:14:53,361
our way--

2611
02:14:53,361 --> 02:14:54,835
LAURA: Stay up top as long as possible?

2612
02:14:54,835 --> 02:14:57,733
ORION: If you're talking about fighting K'Varn in
his lair, when he attacks you--

2613
02:14:57,733 --> 02:15:00,753
LAURA: We're not going into-- What if we can just
attack from the roof?

2614
02:15:00,753 --> 02:15:02,337
From the opening in the roof.

2615
02:15:02,337 --> 02:15:05,311
LIAM: Your plan is to lead the charge into
K'Varn's lair. That's what you're saying. Do I

2616
02:15:05,311 --> 02:15:06,756
have that correctly?

2617
02:15:06,756 --> 02:15:07,740
(laughter)

2618
02:15:07,740 --> 02:15:08,755
ORION: Absolutely not, Vax.

2619
02:15:08,755 --> 02:15:10,930
LAURA: Is that possible? Can we attack from the
roof, from the opening in the ceiling? Can we

2620
02:15:10,930 --> 02:15:12,841
attack him from up there? We don't have to go in.

2621
02:15:12,841 --> 02:15:14,326
ORION: Possibly, yes.

2622
02:15:14,326 --> 02:15:20,061
MATT: Kima gives a nod to that and is like, "I'm
useless at that range, but we have a few members

2623
02:15:20,079 --> 02:15:22,175
"of the party that excel at that."

2624
02:15:22,175 --> 02:15:30,769
LAURA: Maybe we drop the thing, attack from above
as long as possible, and hope the illithid attack him.

2625
02:15:30,769 --> 02:15:34,275
TRAVIS: Sorry. One last question. So his eye
cancels out magic, right?

2626
02:15:34,275 --> 02:15:35,296
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2627
02:15:35,296 --> 02:15:39,026
TRAVIS: So the more places we make him look, the
more of a chance we have to get it away from the

2628
02:15:39,026 --> 02:15:40,249
magic users, right?

2629
02:15:40,249 --> 02:15:41,330
LAURA AND TALIESIN: Yes.

2630
02:15:41,330 --> 02:15:43,815
TRAVIS: So instead of just two people, why don't
we do all three? If there are two doors, and the

2631
02:15:43,815 --> 02:15:48,075
skylight, why don't we have three teams so he has
to pick which one he looks at?

2632
02:15:48,075 --> 02:15:50,713
LAURA: Nobody go in the temple, everybody attack
from outside.

2633
02:15:50,713 --> 02:15:56,154
TRAVIS: I mean, I can take one of the doors at the
bottom and try and keep people from coming in.

2634
02:15:56,452 --> 02:15:59,124
TALIESIN: That's a really-- That's a really good
idea, actually.

2635
02:15:59,124 --> 02:16:04,737
MATT: Clarota pipes up and says, "The two other
doors are accessible from only within the temple.

2636
02:16:04,811 --> 02:16:11,388
"If you had two parties to enter the two other
doors, they would have to go through the entire

2637
02:16:11,388 --> 02:16:18,554
"subfloor, find a way up, which you're welcome to
try, but who knows."

2638
02:16:18,554 --> 02:16:22,221
LAURA: Oh, I was thinking it was just like a giant
pyramid, with one roof.

2639
02:16:22,221 --> 02:16:24,151
(laughter)

2640
02:16:24,151 --> 02:16:25,242
ORION: That would be the best-case scenario.

2641
02:16:25,242 --> 02:16:26,888
LAURA: That makes so much sense, though, that it's
not.

2642
02:16:26,888 --> 02:16:28,024
(laughter)

2643
02:16:28,024 --> 02:16:31,889
TALIESIN: To be fair, traditionally, that's very
similar to how pyramids are built.

2644
02:16:31,889 --> 02:16:33,507
TRAVIS: Okay, what else were you going to say?

2645
02:16:33,507 --> 02:16:36,034
MATT: That was all Clarota had to add to that.

2646
02:16:36,034 --> 02:16:37,744
TALIESIN: It was a good thought.

2647
02:16:37,744 --> 02:16:43,914
MARISHA: We could still take a similar approach
and just have-- We've already decided we're going

2648
02:16:43,914 --> 02:16:52,962
to have two teams to be on two separate ends to do
the slidey-- The hingey maneuver. And then have a

2649
02:16:52,962 --> 02:16:56,390
third team that's K'Varn distraction duty.

2650
02:16:56,390 --> 02:17:00,484
LAURA: Yeah. Oh god.

2651
02:17:00,484 --> 02:17:05,103
ASHLEY: Do we do distraction duty? Maybe people
who have really high--

2652
02:17:05,103 --> 02:17:09,581
LAURA: So this is the beam. And we're going to
attack this one and this one, yeah?

2653
02:17:09,581 --> 02:17:11,128
MARISHA: Right, so if--

2654
02:17:11,128 --> 02:17:13,066
SAM: We're effed.

2655
02:17:13,066 --> 02:17:18,480
MARISHA: So we've got this pyramid. And there's
this cross beam, you said, right Matt?

2656
02:17:18,480 --> 02:17:19,481
MATT: Yep.

2657
02:17:19,481 --> 02:17:21,567
LAURA: Oh, is it like that? Oh god, I'm picturing
it so fucking different.

2658
02:17:21,567 --> 02:17:24,036
MARISHA: And there's this top of it, which is
open.

2659
02:17:24,036 --> 02:17:25,967
LAURA: Okay.

2660
02:17:25,967 --> 02:17:27,572
MARISHA: So this is the pyramid.

2661
02:17:27,572 --> 02:17:28,835
LAURA: Yeah yeah yeah.

2662
02:17:28,835 --> 02:17:31,733
MARISHA: You can see. And then the thing is, if
you can see through it,

2663
02:17:31,733 --> 02:17:33,751
the thing is hanging down.

2664
02:17:33,751 --> 02:17:34,887
LAURA: Like that.

2665
02:17:34,887 --> 02:17:36,215
MARISHA: And it looks, it's all spirally.

2666
02:17:36,215 --> 02:17:37,231
LAURA: Okay.

2667
02:17:37,231 --> 02:17:38,030
MARISHA: And then here is--

2668
02:17:38,030 --> 02:17:38,847
LAURA: The Elder Brain.

2669
02:17:38,847 --> 02:17:39,644
MARISHA: The Elder Brain.

2670
02:17:39,644 --> 02:17:41,002
ORION: And where's beholder-face?

2671
02:17:41,002 --> 02:17:42,403
MARISHA: Somewhere in here!

2672
02:17:42,403 --> 02:17:46,605
LAURA: So we're going for one side of it.

2673
02:17:46,605 --> 02:17:47,800
MARISHA: So if we go for--

2674
02:17:47,800 --> 02:17:50,380
LAURA: And it hopefully goes--

2675
02:17:50,380 --> 02:17:53,194
TALIESIN: I'm just going to keep breaking-- I'm
just going to keep

2676
02:17:53,194 --> 02:17:54,918
breaking hinges until it swings.

2677
02:17:54,918 --> 02:17:55,996
LAURA: Okay.

2678
02:17:55,996 --> 02:17:58,067
TRAVIS: Is anybody interested in going underneath
the pyramid with me?

2679
02:17:58,067 --> 02:18:00,199
TALIESIN: You? Technically, you could really go
underneath it.

2680
02:18:00,199 --> 02:18:04,563
LAURA: I feel like you'll be fighting a lot more
things. I think it's better to just go from the

2681
02:18:04,563 --> 02:18:07,053
top, and drop in if we have to.

2682
02:18:07,053 --> 02:18:08,207
TRAVIS: Okay.

2683
02:18:08,207 --> 02:18:10,574
MARISHA: Drop in if we have to and, yeah.

2684
02:18:10,574 --> 02:18:12,751
TRAVIS: And just scatter to different areas so he
has to look around.

2685
02:18:12,751 --> 02:18:15,034
TALIESIN: Keep him looking around.

2686
02:18:15,034 --> 02:18:16,466
TRAVIS: We can't stay together.

2687
02:18:16,466 --> 02:18:19,212
TALIESIN: And remember that, if you don't use
magic, and especially you have one magic attack,

2688
02:18:19,212 --> 02:18:22,904
don't try and use magic when the main eye is on
you.

2689
02:18:22,904 --> 02:18:24,958
TRAVIS: No no. Yeah. Butthole only.

2690
02:18:24,958 --> 02:18:29,532
ASHLEY: All right. Are we going up?

2691
02:18:29,532 --> 02:18:31,669
TALIESIN: Let's. I think we should try this.

2692
02:18:31,669 --> 02:18:36,981
MARISHA: So, okay okay, hang on. What happens if
this starts going poorly?

2693
02:18:36,981 --> 02:18:38,418
LAURA: Then we run.

2694
02:18:38,418 --> 02:18:39,567
TRAVIS: Which it's bound to do.

2695
02:18:39,567 --> 02:18:40,773
LAURA: We run away.

2696
02:18:40,773 --> 02:18:46,683
ORION: Actually, if everything starts going amiss,
I will make the call. Follow me and I will get out

2697
02:18:46,683 --> 02:18:48,360
of here as soon as possible.

2698
02:18:48,360 --> 02:18:51,661
LAURA: How will we follow you if you're on a
carpet and we're standing on a thing, and--

2699
02:18:51,661 --> 02:18:53,334
MARISHA: Or if you're dead?

2700
02:18:53,334 --> 02:18:54,979
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're all in different places.

2701
02:18:54,979 --> 02:18:57,593
ORION: If I'm dead, then I'm afraid none of you
will survive.

2702
02:18:57,593 --> 02:19:02,139
TRAVIS: But if we're all around the room, let's
say we've got in there and it's fallen off and

2703
02:19:02,139 --> 02:19:05,801
we're all around the thing. You can't all whip us
out of there. We have to be in one area, right?

2704
02:19:05,801 --> 02:19:07,589
ORION: What?

2705
02:19:07,589 --> 02:19:08,943
LAURA: Yeah, okay.

2706
02:19:08,943 --> 02:19:10,518
ASHLEY: We all have to be in one area.

2707
02:19:10,518 --> 02:19:11,893
ORION: We have to be on the carpet? Is that a
carpet joke?

2708
02:19:11,893 --> 02:19:15,817
TRAVIS: No no no. I was asking, you can't teleport
a room out, we have to be together, right?

2709
02:19:15,817 --> 02:19:19,580
ORION: I can make a portal that we can all step in
and bamf to--

2710
02:19:19,580 --> 02:19:21,640
TRAVIS: But we have to be near you, right?

2711
02:19:21,640 --> 02:19:24,181
ORION: We have to be where I cast it, yes. Yeah.

2712
02:19:24,181 --> 02:19:25,988
TALIESIN: So if he makes the portal, you have to
get to the portal.

2713
02:19:25,988 --> 02:19:27,192
ORION: Yes.

2714
02:19:27,192 --> 02:19:28,528
TRAVIS: We might not have that luxury.

2715
02:19:28,528 --> 02:19:29,506
TALIESIN: We might not.

2716
02:19:29,506 --> 02:19:32,799
MARISHA: Should we have a safe location?

2717
02:19:32,799 --> 02:19:37,146
TRAVIS: Should we have a run-away word, a safety
word, like Oklahoma, or something?

2718
02:19:37,146 --> 02:19:40,844
TALIESIN: How about "Oh god, we're all going to
die. Run away, run away right now. My god, my god,

2719
02:19:41,084 --> 02:19:42,743
"we're all going to die"?

2720
02:19:42,743 --> 02:19:45,056
ORION: Oh, Percy, yes. I believe it's this.

2721
02:19:45,056 --> 02:19:46,897
TALIESIN: Yes, we'll do this.

2722
02:19:46,897 --> 02:19:48,490
ORION: I'll do the signal.

2723
02:19:48,490 --> 02:19:50,038
SAM: Just to clarify.

2724
02:19:50,038 --> 02:19:51,155
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2725
02:19:51,155 --> 02:19:55,517
SAM: Before we go. I am dropping a giant mouse in
there, right?

2726
02:19:55,517 --> 02:19:56,783
LAURA AND TALIESIN: Yes.

2727
02:19:56,783 --> 02:19:57,741
TRAVIS: You are.

2728
02:19:57,741 --> 02:19:58,810
SAM: Okay.

2729
02:19:58,810 --> 02:20:00,678
ASHLEY: Going up on a Thursday!

2730
02:20:00,678 --> 02:20:03,133
LAURA: Oh god. Okay, so, are we doing it?

2731
02:20:03,133 --> 02:20:04,992
SAM: Come on, let's go have some fun!

2732
02:20:04,992 --> 02:20:06,959
TALIESIN: He's just sitting here, laughing.

2733
02:20:06,959 --> 02:20:13,707
MATT: Kima lobs her maul on her shoulder and gives
you a look and says, "Yes, this day we save

2734
02:20:13,707 --> 02:20:21,019
"Kraghammer, Cliffkeep Mountains, and quite
possibly, the future of Tal'Dorei. But if we fall,

2735
02:20:21,019 --> 02:20:25,488
"others will come to try and finish our journey."

2736
02:20:25,488 --> 02:20:27,062
SAM: Good pep talk.

2737
02:20:27,062 --> 02:20:34,408
MATT: "Either way, we do this as heroes, we do
this together, for Vox Machina."

2738
02:20:34,408 --> 02:20:35,800
SAM: Ooh.

2739
02:20:35,800 --> 02:20:38,267
MATT: She puts her hand out in the center.

2740
02:20:38,267 --> 02:20:44,116
SAM: Oh, Kima. Clarota, are you going to put
your--

2741
02:20:44,116 --> 02:20:53,568
MATT: Clarota slowly hovers towards the center.

2742
02:20:53,568 --> 02:20:55,957
LAURA: Yeah, Clarota.

2743
02:20:55,957 --> 02:20:57,464
ASHLEY: And Trinket?

2744
02:20:57,464 --> 02:21:02,488
MATT: These terrible, long, lanky fingers almost
wrap around the cluster of hands at the top. Cold

2745
02:21:02,488 --> 02:21:06,464
and nasty. Trinket comes up and nuzzles in the
center.

2746
02:21:06,464 --> 02:21:08,474
LAURA: Oh, good.

2747
02:21:08,474 --> 02:21:11,103
MATT: Kima, once more, says, "For Vox Machina!"

2748
02:21:11,103 --> 02:21:13,177
ALL: Vox Machina!

2749
02:21:13,177 --> 02:21:16,681
SAM: We're a well-oiled machine.

2750
02:21:16,681 --> 02:21:18,814
LIAM: Let's go do the stupidest thing we've ever
done.

2751
02:21:18,814 --> 02:21:20,202
MARISHA: Grog, what are you thinking over there?

2752
02:21:20,202 --> 02:21:21,220
SAM: How are we getting there?

2753
02:21:21,220 --> 02:21:22,540
TRAVIS: So, one problem is-- We're still coming
in--

2754
02:21:22,540 --> 02:21:23,398
SAM: (groans)

2755
02:21:23,398 --> 02:21:25,051
TRAVIS: I know, I know. We're all still coming in
through one area, though. It's like the fatal

2756
02:21:25,051 --> 02:21:27,879
funnel. It's like a doorway. If you all come in
through the doorway, you're all in one spot.

2757
02:21:27,879 --> 02:21:29,586
SAM: It's also an easy way out.

2758
02:21:29,586 --> 02:21:33,570
MARISHA: It worked for the Spartans in that
awesome 300 comic.

2759
02:21:33,570 --> 02:21:37,794
TRAVIS: This guy has, like, 12 dick-finger eyes.
It's all bad. It's all bad.

2760
02:21:37,794 --> 02:21:39,444
ASHLEY: Dick-finger eyes?

2761
02:21:39,444 --> 02:21:42,707
TRAVIS: All right.

2762
02:21:42,707 --> 02:21:46,022
MARISHA: Shut up. It was awesome in the comic.

2763
02:21:46,022 --> 02:21:49,117
MATT: So, what is the process, here?

2764
02:21:49,117 --> 02:21:50,524
ASHLEY: What is the plan?

2765
02:21:50,524 --> 02:21:53,712
LAURA: Question. When you guys were flying
overhead, the top of the temple is wide enough for

2766
02:21:53,712 --> 02:21:55,249
us to stand on, yeah?

2767
02:21:55,249 --> 02:22:00,630
MARISHA: It's got a massive cross beam supporting
a giant arch structure.

2768
02:22:00,630 --> 02:22:04,699
MATT: It's about, I'd say, 20 foot by 20 foot.

2769
02:22:04,699 --> 02:22:05,667
ORION: So yes.

2770
02:22:05,667 --> 02:22:08,624
MATT: So it's a pretty wide square. Enough for all
you guys.

2771
02:22:08,624 --> 02:22:10,532
LAURA: Can we stand on the wall of the temple?

2772
02:22:10,532 --> 02:22:11,940
MATT: Oh yeah, there's like a five-foot wall on
the edge.

2773
02:22:11,940 --> 02:22:12,948
LAURA: Okay, okay.

2774
02:22:12,948 --> 02:22:14,965
SAM: I have one more plan, just to throw it out
there.

2775
02:22:14,965 --> 02:22:16,046
TRAVIS: I'm all ears.

2776
02:22:16,046 --> 02:22:18,976
SAM: Just occurred to me. It just occurred to me.

2777
02:22:18,976 --> 02:22:20,509
LAURA: Okay.

2778
02:22:20,509 --> 02:22:26,634
SAM: It could get us into the temple a different
way, but not into the chamber.

2779
02:22:26,634 --> 02:22:27,840
TRAVIS: Okay.

2780
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:31,442
SAM: I could make us all look like illithids.

2781
02:22:31,442 --> 02:22:32,797
TALIESIN: They're psychic.

2782
02:22:32,797 --> 02:22:34,744
TRAVIS: He'll read our minds. He's already in our
heads.

2783
02:22:34,744 --> 02:22:37,707
SAM: He could read our minds but we'll be
outside.

2784
02:22:37,707 --> 02:22:44,546
MATT: Clarota turns to you slowly and says,
piercing in your mind with a force of honesty and

2785
02:22:44,546 --> 02:22:50,745
almost condescending essence, "You will make it
ten feet before the

2786
02:22:50,745 --> 02:22:53,738
"brain is pulled from your skull."

2787
02:22:53,738 --> 02:22:55,450
ORION: So that's a no.

2788
02:22:55,450 --> 02:23:01,222
SAM: Typically, it's "Yes, and," Clarota, but all
right.

2789
02:23:01,222 --> 02:23:04,440
(laughter)

2790
02:23:04,440 --> 02:23:08,794
SAM: All right, all right. Good, then let's just
go divebomb with a big mouse.

2791
02:23:08,794 --> 02:23:12,275
TRAVIS: No, I-- All right.

2792
02:23:12,275 --> 02:23:14,613
ASHLEY: This. Is. Vox Machina!

2793
02:23:14,613 --> 02:23:16,254
MARISHA: Yeah!

2794
02:23:16,254 --> 02:23:18,181
TALIESIN: We do have a thousand-foot Teleport.

2795
02:23:18,181 --> 02:23:20,950
MARISHA: I mean, Grog.

2796
02:23:20,950 --> 02:23:22,544
MATT: The Fomorian stands up.

2797
02:23:22,544 --> 02:23:25,032
TALIESIN: Grog, for ground forces we do have a
thousand-foot Teleport. So we could actually bring

2798
02:23:25,032 --> 02:23:26,570
you into the room.

2799
02:23:26,570 --> 02:23:30,630
MARISHA: If it gets to a point where we want to go
in, I will go in underneath with you. I'll do my

2800
02:23:30,630 --> 02:23:32,363
earth elemental thing.

2801
02:23:32,363 --> 02:23:34,953
TRAVIS: Yeah, anything that'll just split up where
he looks. That's all I wanna do.

2802
02:23:34,953 --> 02:23:36,949
MARISHA: I'll go with you if it gets to that
point.

2803
02:23:36,949 --> 02:23:38,083
TRAVIS: Okay.

2804
02:23:38,083 --> 02:23:49,204
MATT: The Fomorian stands up with his club and
looks to you and says, in Undercommon, "What do

2805
02:23:49,298 --> 02:23:50,900
"you need?"

2806
02:23:50,900 --> 02:23:57,770
SAM: What are we telling the-- Hey, hey! What are
we telling the giant to do? Knock the cross or

2807
02:23:57,770 --> 02:23:58,970
attack K'Varn?

2808
02:23:58,970 --> 02:24:00,931
LAURA: Attack the beholder when it's dropped
there.

2809
02:24:00,931 --> 02:24:08,181
MARISHA: Well, right now, you are going to be
mouse.

2810
02:24:08,181 --> 02:24:10,460
TRAVIS: Good, good.

2811
02:24:10,460 --> 02:24:21,431
MARISHA: And then-- Wait for me to finish my
thought. Stay with me. And then, you fight K'Varn.

2812
02:24:21,431 --> 02:24:26,129
You kill beholder.

2813
02:24:26,129 --> 02:24:29,134
LAURA: Eat. Food. Big eyeball.

2814
02:24:29,134 --> 02:24:32,788
MARISHA: Eat food. Yes, delicacy.

2815
02:24:32,788 --> 02:24:38,053
MATT: Licks the side of his giant club, which you
can see is covered in this horrible mixture of

2816
02:24:38,053 --> 02:24:45,219
moss and rotting entrails from whatever he smashed
the other evening. Licks it off, and goes, "Eat.

2817
02:24:45,219 --> 02:24:53,052
"All right." (grunts) Like slams his chest.

2818
02:24:53,052 --> 02:24:54,665
SAM: I make him a mouse.

2819
02:24:54,665 --> 02:24:57,056
(laughter)

2820
02:24:57,056 --> 02:24:59,366
ORION: There he is!

2821
02:24:59,366 --> 02:25:02,135
LAURA: Oh my gosh, Tiny, you're tiny!

2822
02:25:02,135 --> 02:25:06,051
MATT: Most confused-looking mouse you've ever
seen. If there could be an expression of, "What

2823
02:25:06,051 --> 02:25:08,070
"the fuck?" on a mouse, it's on that one.

2824
02:25:08,070 --> 02:25:10,219
LAURA: He still smells really, really bad.

2825
02:25:10,219 --> 02:25:13,059
LIAM: Who's throwing-- Who's throwing him?

2826
02:25:13,059 --> 02:25:15,270
LAURA: Oh, I'll just keep him with me.

2827
02:25:15,270 --> 02:25:16,621
ASHLEY: I scratch him behind his ears.

2828
02:25:16,621 --> 02:25:17,656
SAM: All right, let's go.

2829
02:25:17,656 --> 02:25:18,825
MATT: Who's on the carpet?

2830
02:25:18,825 --> 02:25:21,060
LIAM: The way we always do it, don't we? Don't the
gnomes fly--

2831
02:25:21,060 --> 02:25:22,287
LAURA: Yeah.

2832
02:25:22,287 --> 02:25:23,418
LIAM: Bird-style.

2833
02:25:23,418 --> 02:25:24,678
SAM: How does Grog get anywhere? I forget.

2834
02:25:24,678 --> 02:25:26,301
LAURA: Are we going to Polymorph Grog?

2835
02:25:26,301 --> 02:25:28,284
TRAVIS: No no. You Levitate me, right?

2836
02:25:28,284 --> 02:25:32,354
ORION: No, I cast Fly on him and I hop on his
back.

2837
02:25:32,354 --> 02:25:34,704
MATT: All right.

2838
02:25:34,704 --> 02:25:36,621
(laughter)

2839
02:25:36,621 --> 02:25:39,494
MATT: I'll allow it.

2840
02:25:39,494 --> 02:25:41,223
ORION: This time you can see.

2841
02:25:41,223 --> 02:25:42,767
TRAVIS: That's true!

2842
02:25:42,767 --> 02:25:44,441
ORION: This should be a lot smoother.

2843
02:25:44,441 --> 02:25:46,207
LIAM: Okay, so Percy, Vex, Vax on the flying
carpet.

2844
02:25:46,207 --> 02:25:47,441
LAURA: And Trinket.

2845
02:25:47,441 --> 02:25:48,713
MARISHA: I'll be on the carpet.

2846
02:25:48,713 --> 02:25:49,448
SAM: Us too.

2847
02:25:49,448 --> 02:25:51,409
MATT: Trinket can't be on the carpet. Trinket's
too heavy for the carpet.

2848
02:25:51,409 --> 02:25:53,514
LAURA: Can anybody shrink Trinket, too?

2849
02:25:53,514 --> 02:25:56,069
SAM: Is Trinket worth it?

2850
02:25:56,069 --> 02:25:58,452
(laughter)

2851
02:25:58,452 --> 02:26:00,700
LAURA: Scanlan. Scanlan.

2852
02:26:00,700 --> 02:26:02,604
SAM: There's just a limited number of spells.

2853
02:26:02,604 --> 02:26:04,441
ORION: Oh no he didn't.

2854
02:26:04,441 --> 02:26:06,767
TALIESIN: Wow.

2855
02:26:06,767 --> 02:26:11,128
SAM: Of course Trinket is worth it. I was saying--
I was being Bizarro Scanlan.

2856
02:26:11,128 --> 02:26:14,712
LAURA: Yeah. Who can shrink my bear?

2857
02:26:14,712 --> 02:26:16,626
MATT: Keyleth, are you hawk, carrying the gnomes?

2858
02:26:16,626 --> 02:26:19,621
MARISHA: No, we're all magic carpeting.

2859
02:26:19,621 --> 02:26:20,666
LIAM: No, we can't all fit.

2860
02:26:20,666 --> 02:26:22,272
MATT: You can fit six people on the carpet.

2861
02:26:22,272 --> 02:26:24,459
LIAM: This is what we always do. You carry the
gnomes--

2862
02:26:24,459 --> 02:26:28,932
LAURA: Can you cast Fly on Trinket and ride him?
I'll ride him, if somebody casts Fly on him.

2863
02:26:28,932 --> 02:26:34,164
MARISHA: Can we-- Here's the thing. If I turn into
a hawk, I won't be able to turn into an earth

2864
02:26:34,164 --> 02:26:35,482
elemental.

2865
02:26:35,482 --> 02:26:37,029
TRAVIS: We don't want to sacrifice that.

2866
02:26:37,029 --> 02:26:38,199
LAURA: No.

2867
02:26:38,199 --> 02:26:41,573
TALIESIN: Why don't we-- Is it possible to drop
off a group and then go back and get the rest?

2868
02:26:41,573 --> 02:26:42,850
A taxi?

2869
02:26:42,850 --> 02:26:44,842
TRAVIS: Yeah, why not? Can we make two trips?

2870
02:26:44,842 --> 02:26:47,710
ASHLEY: We have two carpets, now. Matt?

2871
02:26:47,710 --> 02:26:49,270
(laughter)

2872
02:26:49,270 --> 02:26:51,029
ASHLEY: We have two carpets, now.

2873
02:26:51,029 --> 02:26:53,200
MATT: No.

2874
02:26:53,200 --> 02:26:54,256
(laughter)

2875
02:26:54,256 --> 02:26:55,840
MATT: It doesn't work that way.

2876
02:26:55,840 --> 02:26:56,777
ASHLEY: I tried.

2877
02:26:56,777 --> 02:26:57,914
TALIESIN: It was such a good try.

2878
02:26:57,914 --> 02:27:01,185
TRAVIS: We have-- We have two carpets. Two
carpets.

2879
02:27:01,185 --> 02:27:02,798
ASHLEY: We have two carpets.

2880
02:27:02,798 --> 02:27:05,709
MATT: Boulder falls, smashes party.

2881
02:27:05,709 --> 02:27:07,392
(laughter)

2882
02:27:07,392 --> 02:27:09,163
MATT: All right, so.

2883
02:27:09,163 --> 02:27:12,680
TRAVIS: We're going to make two trips and come
back for seconds. Okay.

2884
02:27:12,680 --> 02:27:15,120
ORION: Two trips, wait what? Why?

2885
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:17,512
MATT: So, first shift is--

2886
02:27:17,512 --> 02:27:22,232
MARISHA: The stealthiest.

2887
02:27:22,232 --> 02:27:26,433
SAM: Don't take offense, but we can leave Kima.
She can't do anything for us up here. She has no

2888
02:27:26,433 --> 02:27:31,593
ranged attacks, she's useless. In a sexy way.

2889
02:27:31,593 --> 02:27:33,829
LAURA: That's not a compliment, Scanlan.

2890
02:27:33,829 --> 02:27:38,444
MATT: Kima looks you dead in the face and says,
"Regardless of what your plans are, I'm bringing

2891
02:27:38,444 --> 02:27:43,062
"this hammer onto the head of that foul
abomination."

2892
02:27:43,062 --> 02:27:44,223
TRAVIS: Yeah, she means it.

2893
02:27:44,223 --> 02:27:46,129
ORION: Yes, of course, but outside, here with me.

2894
02:27:46,129 --> 02:27:53,135
MATT: "I know I will not survive this. But I will
be damned if I don't dent its face before I go."

2895
02:27:53,135 --> 02:27:55,337
TALIESIN: Which is why we're picking you up in the
second group.

2896
02:27:55,337 --> 02:28:02,726
ORION: And, Lady Kima, you must survive. Because
you must tell Allura of my deeds. For no

2897
02:28:02,726 --> 02:28:04,094
particular reason.

2898
02:28:04,094 --> 02:28:06,053
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's not like you'll be there to
collect.

2899
02:28:06,053 --> 02:28:07,139
MATT: "Noted."

2900
02:28:07,139 --> 02:28:08,796
TRAVIS: On the, you know, props. If you die.

2901
02:28:08,796 --> 02:28:14,515
MATT: "Second trip. First, be quiet."

2902
02:28:14,515 --> 02:28:16,517
TALIESIN: Yes. Stealth, stealth.

2903
02:28:16,517 --> 02:28:18,057
MARISHA: Stealth people first.

2904
02:28:18,057 --> 02:28:19,606
ASHLEY: Stealthy should go first, and that's not
me.

2905
02:28:19,606 --> 02:28:20,902
TRAVIS: And we'll fly the carpet back.

2906
02:28:20,902 --> 02:28:22,228
LAURA: You promise you'll take care of Trinket if
I go--

2907
02:28:22,228 --> 02:28:24,449
TRAVIS: Right. So we'll fly. And then we'll fly
the carpet back.

2908
02:28:24,449 --> 02:28:29,139
LAURA: Can Trinket go in a smaller group? He'll
fit on the carpet if there's a smaller group?

2909
02:28:29,139 --> 02:28:31,066
MATT: Too heavy, unfortunately. It's a big bear.

2910
02:28:31,066 --> 02:28:33,419
LIAM: How's he going to get from the top of the
pyramid down in? Maybe he should hide here and

2911
02:28:33,419 --> 02:28:36,219
live to tell our story.

2912
02:28:36,219 --> 02:28:41,427
TRAVIS: He's going to drop me off on the first
trip, take Fly off of me, he'll get on the carpet,

2913
02:28:41,427 --> 02:28:43,421
come back for the second group, and Fly Trinket.

2914
02:28:43,421 --> 02:28:46,793
ORION: No, you'll keep Fly up. Because I can just
hop on the carpet.

2915
02:28:46,793 --> 02:28:50,268
TRAVIS: That's what I mean, once I'm up on the
temple, you take it off of me. And then you can

2916
02:28:50,268 --> 02:28:52,772
put it on Trinket, because I'll be chilling on the
top.

2917
02:28:52,772 --> 02:28:53,944
LAURA: But that's casting it twice.

2918
02:28:53,944 --> 02:28:55,004
ORION: I'm casting it twice.

2919
02:28:55,004 --> 02:28:55,901
TRAVIS: Which you can't do?

2920
02:28:55,901 --> 02:28:57,051
ORION: But Trinket can get on the carpet.

2921
02:28:57,051 --> 02:28:58,560
LAURA: No, he can't ride the carpet, we just said
that.

2922
02:28:58,560 --> 02:29:01,379
TALIESIN: Trinket should stay with the boat as
opposed to fighting the beholder.

2923
02:29:01,379 --> 02:29:02,733
ORION: He needs a diet.

2924
02:29:02,733 --> 02:29:06,304
TALIESIN: Those are your options, is Trinket
fights a beholder, or Trinket stays.

2925
02:29:06,304 --> 02:29:08,143
MATT: As you're having this discussion, Trinket
comes over.

2926
02:29:08,143 --> 02:29:09,211
LAURA: Trinket.

2927
02:29:09,211 --> 02:29:15,236
MATT: Rubs his nose along you, and gives you a look
of, like a very stern stance of, essentially, the

2928
02:29:15,315 --> 02:29:17,980
feeling is Trinket wants to be by your side for
this.

2929
02:29:17,980 --> 02:29:20,132
LAURA: Yeah, Trinket wants to be by my side, you
guys.

2930
02:29:20,132 --> 02:29:24,623
TRAVIS: How the fuck do we get him up there?

2931
02:29:24,623 --> 02:29:26,196
ASHLEY: All right, who's on the first carpet?

2932
02:29:26,196 --> 02:29:30,113
MARISHA: Someone's burning a spell, or we're going
in shifts. One of the two.

2933
02:29:30,113 --> 02:29:31,666
TRAVIS: We are doing shifts, right?

2934
02:29:31,666 --> 02:29:32,537
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2935
02:29:32,537 --> 02:29:35,093
LAURA: We don't need to if we burn a spell,
because Trinket's the one that can't fit on the

2936
02:29:35,093 --> 02:29:37,773
carpet in the first place. Everybody else can fit
on, right?

2937
02:29:37,773 --> 02:29:39,417
MATT: Mm-hm.

2938
02:29:39,417 --> 02:29:41,219
MARISHA: So we're picking one, rather.
Polymorphing Trinket--

2939
02:29:41,219 --> 02:29:42,489
ORION: Wait a minute, hold on.

2940
02:29:42,489 --> 02:29:43,535
MARISHA: Or we're casting Fly on him.

2941
02:29:43,535 --> 02:29:47,885
ORION: Hold on a tick. How much can you lift,
Grog?

2942
02:29:47,885 --> 02:29:50,955
TRAVIS: I mean, I weight 645 pounds, so a lot.

2943
02:29:50,955 --> 02:29:52,280
ORION: So a shit-ton.

2944
02:29:52,280 --> 02:29:56,948
MATT: Grog is not strong enough to carry a bear
and you on a Fly spell.

2945
02:29:56,948 --> 02:29:58,456
MARISHA: What if we cast Fly on the bear?

2946
02:29:58,456 --> 02:29:59,758
ORION: No no no. I mean one at a time.

2947
02:29:59,758 --> 02:30:01,177
ASHLEY: It's a good idea, though.

2948
02:30:01,177 --> 02:30:04,108
SAM: We're still doing shifts then.

2949
02:30:04,207 --> 02:30:07,448
MATT: You can try. There's a good chance he might
drop Trinket on the way over. From that height,

2950
02:30:07,448 --> 02:30:08,786
which would be a splatter bear.

2951
02:30:08,786 --> 02:30:11,513
MARISHA: Can you cast Fly on Trinket and then have
Grog ride Trinket?

2952
02:30:11,513 --> 02:30:13,811
SAM: It's the same issue.

2953
02:30:13,811 --> 02:30:15,501
MARISHA: Is that the same problem?

2954
02:30:15,501 --> 02:30:17,568
ASHLEY: What if one of us ride Trinket?

2955
02:30:17,568 --> 02:30:19,963
LAURA: Well, but Grog won't fit on the flying
carpet. This is a really--

2956
02:30:19,963 --> 02:30:21,740
This is like a mind puzzle.

2957
02:30:21,740 --> 02:30:22,981
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

2958
02:30:22,981 --> 02:30:25,627
ASHLEY: How long does it take to make the trip?

2959
02:30:25,627 --> 02:30:28,679
MATT: From flying over there on the carpet, at its
full speed--

2960
02:30:28,679 --> 02:30:30,272
LIAM: Scanlan and I flew over there.

2961
02:30:30,272 --> 02:30:32,285
MATT: I'd say it'd take about 20 minutes or so.

2962
02:30:32,285 --> 02:30:33,378
LAURA: 20 minutes?

2963
02:30:33,378 --> 02:30:34,884
SAM: To fly a mile?

2964
02:30:34,884 --> 02:30:36,050
MATT: 15 minutes.

2965
02:30:36,050 --> 02:30:37,141
ORION: I cast Fly on Trinket.

2966
02:30:37,141 --> 02:30:38,391
MATT: The carpet isn't extremely fast.

2967
02:30:38,391 --> 02:30:41,700
ORION: Oh, wait. And I'll do that. I'll wait,
because I can only do it one at a time. So I'll

2968
02:30:41,700 --> 02:30:42,996
burn it for him.

2969
02:30:42,996 --> 02:30:43,503
TRAVIS: Okay.

2970
02:30:43,503 --> 02:30:44,652
ORION: Let's go.

2971
02:30:44,652 --> 02:30:45,481
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

2972
02:30:45,481 --> 02:30:46,196
SAM: Wait, what did you do?

2973
02:30:46,196 --> 02:30:48,876
ORION: I'll burn it for Trinket. The Fly.

2974
02:30:48,876 --> 02:30:50,448
LAURA: So we can both Fly?

2975
02:30:50,448 --> 02:30:51,758
MARISHA: So we can all Fly?

2976
02:30:51,758 --> 02:30:52,882
ORION: Not right now. No.

2977
02:30:52,882 --> 02:30:54,011
MATT: All right. So.

2978
02:30:54,011 --> 02:30:58,353
ORION: We'll go up first, then I'll come back down
with the carpet, I'll cast Fly on him and whoever is--

2979
02:30:58,353 --> 02:31:08,290
MATT: So, first batch. Vex, Vax, Percy, Scanlan,
Grog is flying. All right. Grog's there.

2980
02:31:08,290 --> 02:31:09,331
SAM: You're staying?

2981
02:31:09,331 --> 02:31:10,245
ORION: I'll stay down with Trinket.

2982
02:31:10,245 --> 02:31:11,619
MARISHA: Who else can go, is there room for one
more?

2983
02:31:11,619 --> 02:31:12,712
ORION: Because I don't need to go up.

2984
02:31:12,712 --> 02:31:13,805
SAM: Oh, what are Kima and Clarota--

2985
02:31:13,805 --> 02:31:16,394
ASHLEY: They're hanging out with Pike.

2986
02:31:16,394 --> 02:31:19,284
MATT: And, we'll say Clarota will go with you guys
because Clarota can stealth. Kima will stay back.

2987
02:31:19,284 --> 02:31:23,673
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on the entire
party, before we all take off.

2988
02:31:23,673 --> 02:31:30,449
MATT: Good. All right. As you guys all continue
forward. Let's see. Keyleth,

2989
02:31:30,449 --> 02:31:31,919
are you going with them?

2990
02:31:31,919 --> 02:31:32,963
MARISHA: No. I stay behind.

2991
02:31:32,963 --> 02:31:33,884
MATT: All right.

2992
02:31:33,884 --> 02:31:41,861
SAM: I'm going to, in front of us, using Minor
Illusion, I'm just going to create a floating bald

2993
02:31:41,861 --> 02:31:45,098
eagle thing to distract the bats with.

2994
02:31:45,098 --> 02:31:46,953
MATT: Okay.

2995
02:31:46,953 --> 02:31:48,688
SAM: It's just flying around.

2996
02:31:48,688 --> 02:31:52,101
MATT: Everyone on the carpet make a stealth check.
Clarota goes invisible.

2997
02:31:52,101 --> 02:31:54,214
TALIESIN: What's the bonus for Pass Without a
Trace?

2998
02:31:54,214 --> 02:31:55,231
ORION: Plus ten.

2999
02:31:55,231 --> 02:31:57,870
TRAVIS: 21.

3000
02:31:57,870 --> 02:31:59,403
SAM: Stealth isn't dexterity, is it?

3001
02:31:59,403 --> 02:32:00,433
MATT: Hmm? Yes it is.

3002
02:32:00,433 --> 02:32:01,611
ORION: 23.

3003
02:32:01,611 --> 02:32:03,129
LAURA: And you add ten.

3004
02:32:03,129 --> 02:32:06,199
SAM: 23.

3005
02:32:06,199 --> 02:32:07,521
MATT: You add ten to it.

3006
02:32:07,521 --> 02:32:08,449
LIAM: 36.

3007
02:32:08,449 --> 02:32:09,369
TRAVIS: Oh, plus ten?

3008
02:32:09,369 --> 02:32:10,239
ORION: Yeah.

3009
02:32:10,239 --> 02:32:11,137
TRAVIS: 31.

3010
02:32:11,137 --> 02:32:11,847
MATT: There you go.

3011
02:32:11,847 --> 02:32:12,552
TALIESIN: 30.

3012
02:32:12,552 --> 02:32:13,292
LAURA: 18.

3013
02:32:13,292 --> 02:32:15,144
MATT: 18 total? All right.

3014
02:32:15,144 --> 02:32:17,628
TRAVIS: Still alive.

3015
02:32:17,628 --> 02:32:19,927
MATT: Okay. You guys make your way--

3016
02:32:19,927 --> 02:32:21,432
TRAVIS: He rolled three times.

3017
02:32:21,432 --> 02:32:22,554
MATT: -- over to the temple.

3018
02:32:22,554 --> 02:32:23,900
SAM: The bats.

3019
02:32:23,900 --> 02:32:30,968
MATT: The bats don't seem to take any notice of
your passage. You find your way slowly coming

3020
02:32:30,968 --> 02:32:36,022
towards the temple. That dull, eerie green glow
towards the top. The carpet finds its way just

3021
02:32:36,022 --> 02:32:40,927
along the edge to the point where you can safely
step off on that little five-foot-wide section of

3022
02:32:40,927 --> 02:32:47,550
walkway that surrounds the glass top. And you do
see it. It is a relatively large, see-through,

3023
02:32:47,550 --> 02:32:53,530
almost glass-like substance. It's hard to say. It
looks like glass. It's about a good three inches

3024
02:32:53,530 --> 02:32:59,001
thick, and the metal beams themselves are bolted
into the stone itself.

3025
02:32:59,001 --> 02:33:02,862
TALIESIN: They're bolted into the stone itself?

3026
02:33:02,862 --> 02:33:04,100
MATT: Yep.

3027
02:33:04,100 --> 02:33:07,923
TALIESIN: I would love to, while we're here, very
quietly examine--

3028
02:33:07,923 --> 02:33:11,440
SAM: Wait, when we've arrived, is anyone going
back? No.

3029
02:33:11,440 --> 02:33:14,859
MARISHA: Yeah, people were dropping people off.

3030
02:33:14,859 --> 02:33:16,147
TALIESIN: Someone's going back.

3031
02:33:16,147 --> 02:33:17,085
SAM: Who's going back?

3032
02:33:17,085 --> 02:33:18,644
ORION: I'm staying on the carpet.

3033
02:33:18,644 --> 02:33:19,632
TALIESIN: So he's going back.

3034
02:33:19,632 --> 02:33:20,852
SAM: And you're going back to pick up the others?

3035
02:33:20,852 --> 02:33:22,939
MATT: And Grog slowly flies over and meets up with
you guys.

3036
02:33:22,939 --> 02:33:24,448
LIAM: I thought you stayed back.

3037
02:33:24,448 --> 02:33:27,297
ORION: No, I had to go with you so I could take
the carpet back.

3038
02:33:27,297 --> 02:33:29,520
ASHLEY: There's enough room now, for the carpet to
go back and take all of us?

3039
02:33:29,520 --> 02:33:31,622
ORION: So I can come back with the carpet.

3040
02:33:31,622 --> 02:33:32,323
MATT: Yeah.

3041
02:33:32,323 --> 02:33:33,194
ORION: Because they're dropped off.

3042
02:33:33,194 --> 02:33:34,236
LAURA: Okay, so you dropped us off.

3043
02:33:34,236 --> 02:33:35,534
MATT: Did you roll a stealth check?

3044
02:33:35,534 --> 02:33:36,335
ORION: Shit.

3045
02:33:36,335 --> 02:33:37,393
LAURA: Oh no.

3046
02:33:37,393 --> 02:33:39,891
ORION: That's 19.

3047
02:33:39,891 --> 02:33:41,024
LAURA: Plus ten?

3048
02:33:41,024 --> 02:33:41,830
ORION: Yeah.

3049
02:33:41,830 --> 02:33:43,195
MATT: Yeah. Okay.

3050
02:33:43,195 --> 02:33:44,506
ORION: Thank you.

3051
02:33:44,506 --> 02:33:48,201
MATT: So, you guys are left at that point, now.

3052
02:33:48,201 --> 02:33:53,699
TALIESIN: I want to examine the structure to see
if I could find the optimal place and the

3053
02:33:53,699 --> 02:33:58,100
weaknesses in the structure. Whether or not it's
more appropriate to pour the acid on the stone,

3054
02:33:58,100 --> 02:34:02,860
whether it's better to pour the acid on the metal.
Just to see where it would be weakest,

3055
02:34:02,860 --> 02:34:04,033
mathematically.

3056
02:34:04,033 --> 02:34:07,180
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Actually no, this would be investigate.

3057
02:34:07,180 --> 02:34:08,313
TALIESIN: Investigate?

3058
02:34:08,313 --> 02:34:09,724
MATT: Yeah.

3059
02:34:09,724 --> 02:34:12,884
ORION: Before I leave to go back down, Vex?

3060
02:34:12,884 --> 02:34:14,796
LAURA: Yes.

3061
02:34:14,796 --> 02:34:17,510
ORION: When you see it, be sure to mark the
beast.

3062
02:34:17,510 --> 02:34:18,703
TALIESIN: 19.

3063
02:34:18,703 --> 02:34:25,824
MATT: All right. You gather, best that you can,
that the metal itself is essentially bolted

3064
02:34:25,824 --> 02:34:32,284
overtop onto the stone. If you were to run the
acid along where the metal is overlapping and

3065
02:34:32,284 --> 02:34:35,872
bolted down on the top, that would weaken it
significantly. The stone itself is not going to

3066
02:34:35,872 --> 02:34:40,803
help much, but where that boundary is, where it's
essentially clamped, that area right there is

3067
02:34:40,803 --> 02:34:43,500
going to be where you want it to put a bleed
through and coat.

3068
02:34:43,500 --> 02:34:44,848
MARISHA: Awesome.

3069
02:34:44,848 --> 02:34:50,129
MATT: All right, are you going back for the
others? All right. Are you guys just standing

3070
02:34:50,129 --> 02:34:51,877
carefully on the edge?

3071
02:34:51,877 --> 02:34:53,882
LAURA: Are we waiting?

3072
02:34:53,882 --> 02:34:59,036
TRAVIS: We are definitely staying out of any kind
of visible sight of the giant meatball.

3073
02:34:59,036 --> 02:35:01,984
MATT: Okay. All right. Tiberius, you head back?

3074
02:35:01,984 --> 02:35:03,381
ORION: Yep.

3075
02:35:03,381 --> 02:35:10,782
MATT: All right. Eventually grabbing the rest of
the group here.

3076
02:35:10,782 --> 02:35:13,699
MARISHA: Can I go ahead and cast Pass Without a
Trace on the rest of us?

3077
02:35:13,699 --> 02:35:15,532
MATT: All righty. Pass without a Trace, second
time. Thank god.

3078
02:35:15,532 --> 02:35:18,822
(laughter)

3079
02:35:18,822 --> 02:35:25,615
MATT: You cast Fly on Trinket. Which is a
hilarious sight. As this large, brown, armored

3080
02:35:25,615 --> 02:35:30,036
bear, all of a sudden is like (confused bear
noise). It takes a good--

3081
02:35:30,036 --> 02:35:35,207
ORION: Trinket, Trinket! Think of Vex. Go to Vex.
Go to Vex. She's up there.

3082
02:35:35,207 --> 02:35:39,651
MATT: As you say that, Trinket, suddenly,
straightens trajectory a little bit and starts

3083
02:35:39,651 --> 02:35:41,287
finding this awkward zig-zag.

3084
02:35:41,287 --> 02:35:43,464
LAURA: That's so cute.

3085
02:35:43,552 --> 02:35:46,373
MATT: But nevertheless is finding some sort of
purchase in this strange, flying environment. You

3086
02:35:46,373 --> 02:35:50,378
can see, if a bear could have an expression, it'd
be bewilderment, confusion, and slowly trickling

3087
02:35:50,378 --> 02:35:51,665
into joy.

3088
02:35:51,665 --> 02:35:53,499
ORION: It's very cool.

3089
02:35:53,499 --> 02:35:54,960
MARISHA: It's so cute.

3090
02:35:54,960 --> 02:35:56,675
SAM: I'm flying!

3091
02:35:56,675 --> 02:35:59,894
MATT: As you all begin to drift back over towards
the center of the city, if I can get a stealth

3092
02:35:59,894 --> 02:36:01,935
check from everybody, including Trinket.

3093
02:36:01,935 --> 02:36:03,278
ASHLEY: And we get a plus ten?

3094
02:36:03,278 --> 02:36:05,668
MATT: Plus ten. Everybody on the second trip.

3095
02:36:05,668 --> 02:36:07,158
ORION: 23.

3096
02:36:07,158 --> 02:36:09,377
MATT: All right.

3097
02:36:09,377 --> 02:36:11,527
MARISHA: 34.

3098
02:36:11,527 --> 02:36:12,702
MATT: All right.

3099
02:36:12,702 --> 02:36:13,678
ASHLEY: 39.

3100
02:36:13,678 --> 02:36:18,661
MATT: All right. And for Trinket?

3101
02:36:18,661 --> 02:36:21,699
LAURA: Oh, um, yeah, that's--

3102
02:36:21,699 --> 02:36:23,937
ASHLEY: Plus ten? 16.

3103
02:36:23,937 --> 02:36:27,940
LAURA: No, plus ten would be 11 because he rolled
a one.

3104
02:36:27,940 --> 02:36:30,666
LIAM: I saw it.

3105
02:36:30,666 --> 02:36:33,462
SAM: "I'm flying!"

3106
02:36:33,462 --> 02:36:36,602
ORION: It's your first time. It's going to be a
little rough.

3107
02:36:36,602 --> 02:36:45,309
MATT: As Trinket continues floating behind the
carpet, you hear this familiar (bat squeaks)--

3108
02:36:45,309 --> 02:36:46,570
SAM: Bats.

3109
02:36:46,570 --> 02:36:50,309
MATT: -- sound as a cluster of bats begin to
descend from a darkened portion over the cavern.

3110
02:36:50,309 --> 02:36:53,573
They're about 60 feet back.

3111
02:36:53,573 --> 02:36:55,085
ORION: How far away is it from me?

3112
02:36:55,085 --> 02:36:56,571
MATT: About 60 feet.

3113
02:36:56,571 --> 02:36:57,762
TRAVIS: Don't do it.

3114
02:36:57,762 --> 02:37:08,224
MARISHA: I turn, and I, seeing the bats come in,
in bat language, in like, you know, echo (bat noises).

3115
02:37:08,224 --> 02:37:11,260
TALIESIN: The bats say, "What are you clicking at
us?"

3116
02:37:11,260 --> 02:37:16,062
MARISHA: Echolocation. I tell the bats, don't
worry about it. Go home.

3117
02:37:16,062 --> 02:37:18,281
ASHLEY: Nothing to see here.

3118
02:37:18,281 --> 02:37:19,542
ORION: Forget about it.

3119
02:37:19,542 --> 02:37:20,787
LAURA: Forget about it.

3120
02:37:20,787 --> 02:37:23,459
MARISHA: We're running an errand for K'Varn. Don't
worry about it.

3121
02:37:23,459 --> 02:37:25,000
MATT: Go make a persuasion check.

3122
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,079
SAM: Persuade those bats.

3123
02:37:27,079 --> 02:37:29,444
LAURA: Inspiration, Inspiration!

3124
02:37:29,444 --> 02:37:31,811
SAM: I'm not with her. I don't even know this is
going on.

3125
02:37:31,811 --> 02:37:36,005
MATT: It doesn't matter what you roll, you can't
persuade bats. They're bats.

3126
02:37:36,005 --> 02:37:37,268
MARISHA: Oh, but I had a good roll.

3127
02:37:37,268 --> 02:37:38,911
MATT: I know, but you can't persuade bats.

3128
02:37:38,911 --> 02:37:39,951
MARISHA: But I had a good roll.

3129
02:37:39,951 --> 02:37:40,855
MATT: But you can't persuade bats.

3130
02:37:40,855 --> 02:37:41,640
ORION: I thought you said roll.

3131
02:37:41,640 --> 02:37:42,949
MATT: I was just fucking with her.

3132
02:37:42,949 --> 02:37:43,979
ORION: Oh.

3133
02:37:43,979 --> 02:37:49,461
MARISHA: I cast Speak with Animals. That's what I
cast. It was a spell.

3134
02:37:49,461 --> 02:37:51,647
MATT: Oh! I did not hear that. I thought you were
just trying to do that.

3135
02:37:51,647 --> 02:37:54,145
(laughter)

3136
02:37:54,145 --> 02:37:56,567
MARISHA: No, I said I do this. I cast Speak with
Animals.

3137
02:37:56,567 --> 02:38:01,552
MATT: I somehow missed that phrase or that never
came up in the conversation. Anybody else hear

3138
02:38:01,552 --> 02:38:02,749
Speak with Animals as a spell?

3139
02:38:02,749 --> 02:38:03,906
LAURA: I heard her say, "I cast--"

3140
02:38:03,906 --> 02:38:05,246
TALIESIN: I was looking at the page.

3141
02:38:05,246 --> 02:38:06,811
MATT: Okay, I missed that. Okay, so.

3142
02:38:06,811 --> 02:38:08,353
ORION: I think you said, "I cast Talk to Bats."

3143
02:38:08,353 --> 02:38:10,232
MATT: So, what was your persuasion roll, then?

3144
02:38:10,232 --> 02:38:11,447
MARISHA: 18.

3145
02:38:11,447 --> 02:38:16,076
MATT: 18, okay. Okay, now this comes into play.
Good. I somehow missed the spell. This was a

3146
02:38:16,076 --> 02:38:19,002
really funny moment of Keyleth in my head, I was
like, "What is-- Okay."

3147
02:38:19,002 --> 02:38:19,989
LIAM: Go home, bats!

3148
02:38:19,989 --> 02:38:21,170
(laughter)

3149
02:38:21,170 --> 02:38:22,433
LIAM: Go home.

3150
02:38:22,433 --> 02:38:24,433
TRAVIS: We all start going, "Go home, bats."

3151
02:38:24,433 --> 02:38:29,657
MATT: Okay, the cluster of bats, you can see,
there is this odd, green glow around them that is

3152
02:38:29,657 --> 02:38:35,067
slightly reminiscent of the top of the temple.
They seem to shudder in place as you're giving off

3153
02:38:35,067 --> 02:38:43,116
this strange series of squeaks and echo-based
sounds. And they seem briefly rattled. As opposed

3154
02:38:43,116 --> 02:38:47,015
to going away, they just stay in place as you guys
drift further and further away.

3155
02:38:47,015 --> 02:38:48,271
ORION: Hmm, good.

3156
02:38:48,271 --> 02:38:50,116
MATT: You don't know what that means, but--

3157
02:38:50,116 --> 02:38:51,742
SAM: It could be anything.

3158
02:38:51,742 --> 02:38:53,003
TRAVIS: Let's do this.

3159
02:38:53,003 --> 02:38:56,549
MATT: You're not getting chased. Eventually you
guys come down. You're now landing around the

3160
02:38:56,549 --> 02:38:58,225
outskirts of this.

3161
02:38:58,225 --> 02:39:00,328
LIAM: He could be watching us, for all we know.

3162
02:39:00,328 --> 02:39:01,729
ORION: I stay on the carpet.

3163
02:39:01,729 --> 02:39:03,530
MATT: You stay on the carpet, all right. So.

3164
02:39:03,530 --> 02:39:06,002
TRAVIS: Oh, we're so finished.

3165
02:39:06,002 --> 02:39:10,017
MATT: What are you doing? While they were off,
what were you doing, there, Percy?

3166
02:39:10,017 --> 02:39:13,688
TALIESIN: I was examining and I've got four vials
of acid.

3167
02:39:13,688 --> 02:39:14,581
MATT: Okay.

3168
02:39:14,581 --> 02:39:17,920
TALIESIN: I've got the three that we had, and then
I've got the fourth, super-- That's a--

3169
02:39:17,920 --> 02:39:19,009
MARISHA: It's really distracting.

3170
02:39:19,009 --> 02:39:20,217
TALIESIN: That's an omen of things to come.

3171
02:39:20,217 --> 02:39:21,186
MARISHA: I hope so.

3172
02:39:21,186 --> 02:39:22,173
MATT: Who has the mouse, by the way?

3173
02:39:22,173 --> 02:39:23,063
LAURA: I have the mouse.

3174
02:39:23,063 --> 02:39:23,820
MATT: Okay.

3175
02:39:23,820 --> 02:39:31,310
TALIESIN: So, I'm going to start by taking our
normal vials of acid and I'm going to pour very

3176
02:39:31,310 --> 02:39:35,284
gingerly right at the sections I want to crack and
start letting it burn.

3177
02:39:35,284 --> 02:39:38,968
LAURA: While we're standing there, I pull out an
arrow and I'm tying the little

3178
02:39:38,968 --> 02:39:41,679
tiny mouse onto an arrow.

3179
02:39:41,679 --> 02:39:47,082
TRAVIS: And I also pull out my climbing equipment
and my 200 feet of rope out of the

3180
02:39:47,082 --> 02:39:48,423
Bag of Holding.

3181
02:39:48,423 --> 02:39:49,541
MATT: All right.

3182
02:39:49,541 --> 02:39:50,664
TRAVIS: And start putting the climbing gear on.

3183
02:39:50,664 --> 02:39:52,845
MATT: All right. Make a stealth check.

3184
02:39:52,845 --> 02:39:55,839
LAURA: Pass without a Trace.

3185
02:39:55,839 --> 02:39:56,896
TRAVIS: 23.

3186
02:39:56,896 --> 02:40:00,452
MATT: 23. Okay.

3187
02:40:00,452 --> 02:40:03,210
MARISHA: Does he get double Pass without a Trace?

3188
02:40:03,210 --> 02:40:05,710
MATT: You take-- No.

3189
02:40:05,710 --> 02:40:08,723
ORION: Are there any jutting stone things,
anywhere around? It's just flat?

3190
02:40:08,723 --> 02:40:14,012
MATT: No, it's smooth, stone surface surrounding
this glass top. Percy, as you've placed the acid

3191
02:40:14,012 --> 02:40:18,446
around the two sides, you kind of slowly move
around and trickled along where the metal beams

3192
02:40:18,446 --> 02:40:24,005
reach the stone. The acid is having an effect, but
it's a very slow--

3193
02:40:24,005 --> 02:40:28,009
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to take the major bottle
of acid, and I'm just going to--

3194
02:40:28,009 --> 02:40:32,979
SAM: Before he does, can I-- I'm going to just see
if there's any magic protecting these-- the metal

3195
02:40:32,979 --> 02:40:34,359
or the joints.

3196
02:40:34,359 --> 02:40:35,734
MATT: Arcana check.

3197
02:40:35,734 --> 02:40:37,765
ORION: I should do it, too.

3198
02:40:37,765 --> 02:40:39,443
SAM: 23.

3199
02:40:39,443 --> 02:40:44,672
MATT: I mean, there is a magical aura to the metal
itself. It does not seem to be protective in

3200
02:40:44,672 --> 02:40:51,831
nature. It is more of a, best you can tell, a
transmutation-based magic. Probably something that

3201
02:40:51,831 --> 02:40:55,302
is directly affiliated with how-- The effect it's
having on the Elder Brain.

3202
02:40:55,302 --> 02:41:00,780
MARISHA: Well, do you want to work on one beam and
I can maybe do a focused soldering on the other?

3203
02:41:00,780 --> 02:41:03,634
LAURA: Can anybody cast Dispel Magic?

3204
02:41:03,634 --> 02:41:04,841
SAM: Yeah, of course.

3205
02:41:04,841 --> 02:41:07,316
SAM: But it doesn't seem like the magic is
protecting the metal.

3206
02:41:07,316 --> 02:41:11,384
TALIESIN: I'm going to just, I'm going to get the
more intense acid. I'm going to just-- I'm just

3207
02:41:11,384 --> 02:41:15,591
going to use the tiniest bit. I want to maintain
as much as I can. I want to start working on it.

3208
02:41:15,591 --> 02:41:19,990
MATT: You use a tiny bit and it does hit the metal
with a (sizzle) and begins to dissolve the metal.

3209
02:41:19,990 --> 02:41:26,149
But the actual metal material also balances the
acid with a little bit. So essentially, you begin

3210
02:41:26,149 --> 02:41:29,478
carving into it, but the little bit you use
doesn't keep burning through it. Burns to a

3211
02:41:29,478 --> 02:41:32,086
certain point, and then just loses its acidity.

3212
02:41:32,086 --> 02:41:37,223
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to keep gingerly slicing
it through, until it's just being held. The minute

3213
02:41:37,223 --> 02:41:39,542
it starts to give, I'm going to shift to the next
one.

3214
02:41:39,542 --> 02:41:43,780
MATT: You make your way about halfway through the
vial before that one platform you feel is about

3215
02:41:43,780 --> 02:41:46,567
halfway or more dissolved through.

3216
02:41:46,567 --> 02:41:48,930
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to take the other
half and I'm going to work on the other--

3217
02:41:48,930 --> 02:41:51,696
MATT: Stealth check.

3218
02:41:51,696 --> 02:41:59,063
SAM: Is there any purchase? Like, can a hand grip
the metal pole?

3219
02:41:59,063 --> 02:42:02,725
MATT: It's built in a way that's almost smooth
entirely of the top. Like, the construction--

3220
02:42:02,725 --> 02:42:03,990
TALIESIN: 29.

3221
02:42:03,990 --> 02:42:11,821
MATT: 29? Okay. So you empty the rest of the
yellow vial on the other side. You can see the

3222
02:42:11,821 --> 02:42:16,456
actual metal-- The area where you dip it, the kind
of yellowish liquid hits this, kind of, smooth

3223
02:42:16,456 --> 02:42:21,817
shiny bronze color and the leftover material is
this, like, thick, horrible dark green color the

3224
02:42:21,817 --> 02:42:28,714
way the two mix and dissolve. You empty the last
of the vial and the other beam gets about halfway

3225
02:42:28,714 --> 02:42:31,876
dissolved through before eventually the last of
it's used up.

3226
02:42:31,876 --> 02:42:37,747
ORION: As I do this, I go to the Bag of Holding,
and I go to the Endless Rope--

3227
02:42:37,747 --> 02:42:39,809
TRAVIS: She has that, actually.

3228
02:42:39,809 --> 02:42:40,864
LAURA: I have that.

3229
02:42:40,864 --> 02:42:42,128
ORION: Oh.

3230
02:42:42,128 --> 02:42:44,866
SAM: You're not with us. You stayed on the
carpet.

3231
02:42:44,866 --> 02:42:45,824
ORION: Yeah, I know.

3232
02:42:45,824 --> 02:42:47,597
LAURA: He's right there, though. Flying next to
us.

3233
02:42:47,597 --> 02:42:53,937
ORION: And, the Endless Rope? As I'm asking for
that, I take out my Immovable Rod and I'm going to

3234
02:42:53,937 --> 02:43:00,767
place it, kind of, in an exit position and
(clicks)! Make it stay right above there.

3235
02:43:00,767 --> 02:43:06,629
MATT: All right. As he releases it, this rod is
now stuck in mid-air, anchored permanently until

3236
02:43:06,629 --> 02:43:08,283
removed by a click in that position.

3237
02:43:08,283 --> 02:43:11,855
ORION: And I start flipping through the rope so it
goes-- The whole time, I'm just doing that so it

3238
02:43:11,855 --> 02:43:13,069
goes all the way down.

3239
02:43:13,069 --> 02:43:14,504
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

3240
02:43:14,504 --> 02:43:17,907
TALIESIN: (whispers) Grog, Grog! We're going to
need a lever. We're going to need-- Wrench. Get a

3241
02:43:17,907 --> 02:43:20,542
blade into the metal, into the iron.

3242
02:43:20,542 --> 02:43:21,646
ORION: 25.

3243
02:43:21,646 --> 02:43:23,656
TALIESIN: And wrench. And you're going to get the
second one.

3244
02:43:23,656 --> 02:43:24,735
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

3245
02:43:24,735 --> 02:43:27,106
TALIESIN: But it should give.

3246
02:43:27,106 --> 02:43:33,075
MATT: All right, so. You've dissolved a portion of
the two metal beams on each side. You guys have a

3247
02:43:33,075 --> 02:43:36,872
mouse, kind of tied to an arrow.

3248
02:43:36,872 --> 02:43:38,437
LAURA: He's secure.

3249
02:43:38,437 --> 02:43:41,068
MATT: What's the plan?

3250
02:43:41,068 --> 02:43:43,137
TRAVIS: Okay.

3251
02:43:43,137 --> 02:43:46,972
MARISHA: I'll take one side. And Grog's going to
take the other beam.

3252
02:43:46,972 --> 02:43:48,321
SAM: And do what?

3253
02:43:48,321 --> 02:43:55,004
MARISHA: I'm going to start-- I'm going to take my
staff and I do a concentrated Heat Metal spell,

3254
02:43:55,004 --> 02:44:00,318
and I'm just going to kind of solder right along
the inside where it's already weakened.

3255
02:44:00,318 --> 02:44:04,392
MATT: Okay. You understand the spell Heat Metal is
less of a localized damaging the metal. What it

3256
02:44:04,392 --> 02:44:08,399
does is just causes a metal structure to, in
itself, become hot.

3257
02:44:08,399 --> 02:44:09,442
MARISHA: Right.

3258
02:44:09,442 --> 02:44:12,577
MATT: You would not be able to necessarily damage
the metal with it. What you would do is you'd be

3259
02:44:12,577 --> 02:44:15,573
able to weaken it universally, possibly, with
enough heat.

3260
02:44:15,573 --> 02:44:18,684
It's not like a blowtorch or anything.

3261
02:44:18,684 --> 02:44:23,018
MARISHA: Well then, why don't I'll heat the metal
while Grog is prying it to help?

3262
02:44:23,018 --> 02:44:25,830
LAURA: It could also hurt Grog if he's touching it
if it's that hot.

3263
02:44:25,830 --> 02:44:27,365
TRAVIS: I've got a wooden handle.

3264
02:44:27,365 --> 02:44:28,302
LAURA: Okay.

3265
02:44:28,302 --> 02:44:29,843
MARISHA: He's using like a crowbar. Right?

3266
02:44:29,843 --> 02:44:31,383
TALIESIN: Using an axe, I'd imagine.

3267
02:44:31,383 --> 02:44:32,297
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3268
02:44:32,297 --> 02:44:33,589
MARISHA: Well we'll tag team it, then.

3269
02:44:33,589 --> 02:44:35,416
MATT: So you're attempting to pop?

3270
02:44:35,416 --> 02:44:40,239
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're going to stick down, and
just pull.

3271
02:44:40,239 --> 02:44:41,483
SAM: Loud.

3272
02:44:41,483 --> 02:44:45,866
LAURA: What if we just give old mousey here-- Turn
him into a giant again and drop him right on it?

3273
02:44:45,866 --> 02:44:47,216
TRAVIS: It's not weakened enough yet, is it?

3274
02:44:47,216 --> 02:44:49,315
TALIESIN: It's not weakened. We're going to - We
have to crack it.

3275
02:44:49,315 --> 02:44:53,505
MATT: Kima looks there and says, "At a certain
height, I imagine it would work."

3276
02:44:53,505 --> 02:44:57,540
MARISHA: Yeah, but we want to save him. Let's see
if we can do this, first.

3277
02:44:57,540 --> 02:45:02,524
TALIESIN: Well, yeah. Let's-- This is not going to
be loud. Well, it will be loud once it breaks.

3278
02:45:02,524 --> 02:45:05,585
TRAVIS: We get him in place and then try it, and
if it makes a noise, we just drop him?

3279
02:45:05,585 --> 02:45:07,161
LAURA: I've got him notched on the arrow.

3280
02:45:07,161 --> 02:45:10,241
TRAVIS: Shoot him up, and have him come down.

3281
02:45:10,241 --> 02:45:14,076
MARISHA: Well, we can have Tiberius hit him with,
like, a quick damaging spell and make him--

3282
02:45:14,076 --> 02:45:15,759
SAM: We can fly up and just drop him down like a
big, giant bomb.

3283
02:45:15,759 --> 02:45:18,610
TRAVIS: We need him to fall, like King Kong from
the Empire State building.

3284
02:45:18,610 --> 02:45:19,909
SAM: We can take him up up up, and just drop him.

3285
02:45:19,909 --> 02:45:21,677
TALIESIN: Yeah, we do have a flying carpet.

3286
02:45:21,677 --> 02:45:22,863
SAM: How much does he weigh?

3287
02:45:22,863 --> 02:45:27,322
MATT: The Fomorian, you imagine, probably weighs,
oof.

3288
02:45:27,322 --> 02:45:28,915
SAM: A ton?

3289
02:45:28,915 --> 02:45:30,322
MATT: I'd say three to five tons.

3290
02:45:30,322 --> 02:45:32,310
SAM: That'll break it. (laughs).

3291
02:45:32,310 --> 02:45:33,722
MARISHA: Well, why don't we weaken the beams
first?

3292
02:45:33,722 --> 02:45:35,988
MATT: I'd say about three tons.

3293
02:45:35,988 --> 02:45:41,842
TRAVIS: What if we-- If we give ourselves away,
what do we lose? A lot? I don't think it's worth it.

3294
02:45:41,842 --> 02:45:44,930
SAM: Let's drop a-- Let's drop a giant bomb on
him.

3295
02:45:44,930 --> 02:45:46,879
MARISHA: What do you mean?

3296
02:45:46,879 --> 02:45:50,649
TRAVIS: Well, we'll give away-- So if, like, we
try and weaken and the metal makes any noise,

3297
02:45:50,649 --> 02:45:52,857
anything, right? Jig's up.

3298
02:45:52,857 --> 02:45:56,078
MARISHA: Well it's good-- jig's going to be up as
soon as a giant--

3299
02:45:56,078 --> 02:45:59,597
TRAVIS: Yeah, at least it's going through. Like,
we won't have even gotten through--

3300
02:45:59,597 --> 02:46:03,037
MARISHA: But what if it doesn't bust all the way
through until we start popping some of the beams?

3301
02:46:03,037 --> 02:46:05,776
SAM: I don't-- I think dropping three tons on him
is going have much more--

3302
02:46:05,776 --> 02:46:08,323
TRAVIS: And even if it doesn't, it might be better
than trying to crank it.

3303
02:46:08,323 --> 02:46:11,344
MARISHA: It's a three-inch-thick piece of pane and
steel.

3304
02:46:11,344 --> 02:46:13,449
TALIESIN: I'm going to do-- Would I have gotten
enough engineering information about it to

3305
02:46:13,449 --> 02:46:16,497
actually have a good sense on whether or not three
to five tons would actually

3306
02:46:16,497 --> 02:46:17,720
do anything at this point?

3307
02:46:17,720 --> 02:46:18,751
MATT: Investigation check.

3308
02:46:18,751 --> 02:46:22,233
TALIESIN: Another investigation? 15.

3309
02:46:22,233 --> 02:46:28,219
MATT: Looking at the sections of the beams that
you've damaged, the thickness of the plane and the

3310
02:46:28,219 --> 02:46:32,877
metal bars, the part where they attached-- You're
not getting a full view, 'cause you're not

3311
02:46:32,877 --> 02:46:36,160
actually looking in the room yet. Everyone's
avoided looking in the room at this point. But you

3312
02:46:36,160 --> 02:46:41,613
gather, with enough speed and enough weight, this
thing would break and hinge pretty easily.

3313
02:46:41,613 --> 02:46:45,389
TALIESIN: All right, let's go for it. I'm going
to-- I'm just going to show where

3314
02:46:45,389 --> 02:46:46,453
I want him to drop.

3315
02:46:46,453 --> 02:46:48,583
LAURA: Okay, we bring him up.

3316
02:46:48,583 --> 02:46:50,537
TALIESIN: This is the point. Take him all the way
up.

3317
02:46:50,537 --> 02:46:54,598
MARISHA: Should I go ahead and heat the metal,
just in case, for added stuff?

3318
02:46:54,598 --> 02:46:55,804
I mean, that's quiet.

3319
02:46:55,804 --> 02:46:57,753
TRAVIS: Yeah, why not? Wouldn't hurt.

3320
02:46:57,753 --> 02:47:07,567
LIAM: Can I just say, I have no idea what's about
to happen, but it's been a great pleasure to walk

3321
02:47:07,567 --> 02:47:09,445
beside each and every one of you.

3322
02:47:09,445 --> 02:47:11,847
TRAVIS: Are you doing the, "It's been an honor to
serve with you, sir"?

3323
02:47:11,847 --> 02:47:13,379
MARISHA: Why would you say that?

3324
02:47:13,379 --> 02:47:17,786
TALIESIN: Screw you. I want my final words with
you to be indignant and irritated.

3325
02:47:17,786 --> 02:47:20,283
ORION: I agree. I think that's poppycock. We'll be
fine.

3326
02:47:20,283 --> 02:47:22,020
TALIESIN: We'll apologize later.

3327
02:47:22,020 --> 02:47:23,743
SAM: All right, who's flying the mouse up?

3328
02:47:23,743 --> 02:47:27,995
LAURA: Tiberius, me and you?

3329
02:47:27,995 --> 02:47:30,979
ORION: Yes. Come up.

3330
02:47:30,979 --> 02:47:34,073
LAURA: But we're going to drop him as a full
three-ton weight.

3331
02:47:34,073 --> 02:47:36,905
SAM: I'm Polymorphing him. I'll make him drop.

3332
02:47:36,905 --> 02:47:40,266
MARISHA: We weakened only one side, so hopefully
it'll only smash one side.

3333
02:47:40,266 --> 02:47:42,034
TRAVIS: It'll just fall in? It won't go straight
down.

3334
02:47:42,034 --> 02:47:45,507
MARISHA: Maybe we can even try and aim him leaning
towards our side more.

3335
02:47:45,507 --> 02:47:47,351
LAURA: We'll aim him towards the part that will
break.

3336
02:47:47,351 --> 02:47:50,160
ORION: Just shoot him wherever we need him to
drop, and (pfft).

3337
02:47:50,160 --> 02:47:51,983
LIAM: No, we want him to be weight.

3338
02:47:51,983 --> 02:47:56,371
LAURA: And the three tons, so we want him to be a
giant when he falls.

3339
02:47:56,371 --> 02:47:58,303
ORION: Oh, 'cause he's fat?

3340
02:47:58,303 --> 02:47:59,314
LAURA: Exactly.

3341
02:47:59,314 --> 02:48:01,579
TRAVIS: Shall we execute Manhattan Project?

3342
02:48:01,579 --> 02:48:02,531
SAM: Come on, let's do this.

3343
02:48:02,531 --> 02:48:03,515
LAURA: Fly it up.

3344
02:48:03,515 --> 02:48:04,566
LIAM: (high-pitched) It's been an honor.

3345
02:48:04,566 --> 02:48:08,239
SAM: On the carpet. Go. Do.

3346
02:48:08,310 --> 02:48:11,684
We die with honor.

3347
02:48:11,684 --> 02:48:14,330
MATT: So Tiberius on the carpet?

3348
02:48:14,330 --> 02:48:16,946
ASHLEY: I feel like I'm already just going to
start crying.

3349
02:48:16,946 --> 02:48:20,112
ORION: Yes, I'll take the mouse.

3350
02:48:20,188 --> 02:48:23,955
MATT: Tiberius, you take the mouse in your hand.
And for a second, it's adorable until the smell

3351
02:48:23,955 --> 02:48:30,060
hits you. You all sit around the edge, like,
keeping out of view. You can see a little bit of

3352
02:48:30,060 --> 02:48:32,238
faint light coming through the glass.

3353
02:48:32,238 --> 02:48:33,347
ORION: Throw me the mouse.

3354
02:48:33,347 --> 02:48:38,143
MATT: As the general green glow that permeates the
circumstance. Tiberius slowly lifts up--

3355
02:48:38,143 --> 02:48:43,311
MARISHA: I start heating the metal beams,
concentrating from both sides.

3356
02:48:43,311 --> 02:48:56,146
MATT: Okay. As you get overhead, Tiberius, you get
the first look into this room.

3357
02:48:56,170 --> 02:48:59,264
SAM: Cages of bad guys.

3358
02:48:59,341 --> 02:49:00,897
TRAVIS: No, experimentees.

3359
02:49:00,897 --> 02:49:03,351
LIAM: This is the suck.

3360
02:49:03,351 --> 02:49:05,084
TRAVIS: I think I just caked my pants a little
bit.

3361
02:49:05,084 --> 02:49:10,449
SAM: I think Matt had things printed in a 3D
printer for this, so it's pretty, pretty cool.

3362
02:49:10,633 --> 02:49:13,161
ASHLEY: We gotta get the prisoners to try and help
us.

3363
02:49:13,161 --> 02:49:17,912
TALIESIN: They're the things we've been fighting.

3364
02:49:17,912 --> 02:49:20,295
ASHLEY: They're stitch monsters, okay.

3365
02:49:20,295 --> 02:49:21,572
LIAM: Well, they're a question mark.

3366
02:49:21,572 --> 02:49:23,786
LAURA: They might be controlled-by-K'Varn stitch
monsters.

3367
02:49:23,786 --> 02:49:30,057
MATT: As you glance down inside, you see
immediately in the center of the room, the giant

3368
02:49:30,057 --> 02:49:35,691
brass structure coming to a point above the Elder
Brain in the center of the room on the elevated

3369
02:49:35,691 --> 02:49:41,898
platforms. You see there are two caged sections of
the room that contain two, kind of, flesh,

3370
02:49:41,898 --> 02:49:47,580
skinless, altered creatures that have been
subjected to serious tortures by K'Varn. K'Varn

3371
02:49:47,580 --> 02:49:51,850
floats off in the distance by what looks like some
sort of experimentation table containing glass

3372
02:49:51,850 --> 02:49:54,934
vials and strange, metallic structures.

3373
02:49:54,934 --> 02:50:01,074
ORION: DM, which side has the crew worked on
relative to where I am looking at?

3374
02:50:01,074 --> 02:50:03,519
MATT: Right here, but first we are gonna go ahead
and find--

3375
02:50:03,519 --> 02:50:08,477
ORION: Did they damage this side or this side?

3376
02:50:08,477 --> 02:50:11,966
LAURA: (laughs) We are so high up.

3377
02:50:11,966 --> 02:50:17,668
ASHLEY: I don't-- I don't want to. I just don't
want to do it, I am so scared.

3378
02:50:17,668 --> 02:50:19,858
MATT: All right, so everyone.

3379
02:50:19,858 --> 02:50:22,147
ASHLEY: I have already died. I know how it feels.

3380
02:50:22,147 --> 02:50:23,691
TRAVIS: You're good.

3381
02:50:23,691 --> 02:50:24,939
ORION: Use the boots.

3382
02:50:24,939 --> 02:50:26,628
SAM: I won't let you die, Pike.

3383
02:50:26,628 --> 02:50:31,634
ASHLEY: And I won't let you guys die. I am on it,
I am on it.

3384
02:50:31,634 --> 02:50:34,895
LIAM: I am going to try very hard not to die.

3385
02:50:35,127 --> 02:50:37,185
TALIESIN: Die with hilarity or die not at all.

3386
02:50:37,185 --> 02:50:39,139
MATT: We'll say the group is for the most part up
here.

3387
02:50:39,139 --> 02:50:41,171
ORION: Not me, I am chilling.

3388
02:50:41,171 --> 02:50:44,122
MATT: There is a flying bear up here.

3389
02:50:44,122 --> 02:50:47,681
SAM: That's a crazy roof party.

3390
02:50:47,681 --> 02:50:54,202
ORION: So then they've been working on this side,
right?

3391
02:50:54,202 --> 02:50:56,890
MATT: They are working on this side. It would
essentially hinge this way.

3392
02:50:56,890 --> 02:50:58,394
ORION: This way, wonderful.

3393
02:50:58,394 --> 02:51:00,641
SAM: Okay, drop it, drop it like it's hot.

3394
02:51:00,641 --> 02:51:10,520
MATT: As you glide up, Tiberius, far above,
looking down into this.

3395
02:51:10,520 --> 02:51:16,130
TRAVIS: Before it falls, I would like to rage.

3396
02:51:16,130 --> 02:51:20,344
MATT: All right, is there any other preparatory
spells that want to be cast at this moment? You

3397
02:51:20,344 --> 02:51:22,657
wanna give Inspiration to people? Do you wanna
cast any spells?

3398
02:51:22,657 --> 02:51:25,400
LAURA: Can I see him? Can I go ahead and cast
Hunter's Mark on him right now?

3399
02:51:25,400 --> 02:51:27,973
MATT: You are welcome to look over into the glass
if you'd like.

3400
02:51:27,973 --> 02:51:34,953
SAM: I'll cast Inspiration on this gentleman for
his throw.

3401
02:51:34,953 --> 02:51:39,549
MATT: All right, so that's a d10. You can do that up
to four people.

3402
02:51:39,639 --> 02:51:42,981
SAM: Oh. Pike.

3403
02:51:42,981 --> 02:51:45,703
MATT: d10 inspiration die for you.

3404
02:51:45,703 --> 02:51:47,147
TRAVIS: Me? Oh, for Pike.

3405
02:51:47,147 --> 02:51:47,955
SAM: Grog.

3406
02:51:47,955 --> 02:51:48,967
ASHLEY: Wait, d10 for me?

3407
02:51:48,967 --> 02:51:52,327
MATT: Either an attack, a saving throw-- I'd
recommend saving throw.

3408
02:51:52,327 --> 02:51:53,256
SAM: Percy.

3409
02:51:53,256 --> 02:51:54,303
TALIESIN: Yes?

3410
02:51:54,303 --> 02:51:55,602
SAM: You get Inspiration.

3411
02:51:55,602 --> 02:51:56,583
TALIESIN: Thank you!

3412
02:51:56,583 --> 02:51:57,979
MATT: That's an inspiration dice to you and--

3413
02:51:57,979 --> 02:51:59,840
SAM: And Vax.

3414
02:51:59,961 --> 02:52:08,382
MATT: A d10. And Vax, Vax, a d10 inspiration to
you as well. Keep track of those guys. These are

3415
02:52:08,382 --> 02:52:11,752
the only ones you get from the bard this game,
because he used them up front. Buff spells that

3416
02:52:11,752 --> 02:52:13,606
want to be cast at this point in time?

3417
02:52:13,606 --> 02:52:15,139
LIAM: I am clicking my Boots of Haste.

3418
02:52:15,139 --> 02:52:20,106
SAM: (sings) And so I come to you with
Inspiration.

3419
02:52:20,106 --> 02:52:21,717
MATT: Pike, any buff spells you wanna put on?

3420
02:52:21,717 --> 02:52:29,859
ASHLEY: I am gonna cast Death Ward on Grog.

3421
02:52:29,859 --> 02:52:32,502
MATT: Okay, is Grog the only one you want to cast
it on?

3422
02:52:32,502 --> 02:52:33,818
ASHLEY: I can cast it on more?

3423
02:52:33,818 --> 02:52:36,694
MATT: Yeah, it's not concentration. As many
fourth-level spell as you have, you can cast it on

3424
02:52:36,694 --> 02:52:39,133
different people. It lasts for eight hours.

3425
02:52:39,133 --> 02:52:44,709
ASHLEY: So how many people can I cast it on if I
cast it?

3426
02:52:44,709 --> 02:52:47,294
MATT: As many 4th-level spells as you have. It's
one person per cast.

3427
02:52:47,294 --> 02:52:49,805
MARISHA: I am gonna go ahead and cast Stoneskin on
myself.

3428
02:52:49,805 --> 02:52:53,671
TRAVIS: So Death Ward, if you go down to zero, it
will put you at a one, it won't take you under?

3429
02:52:53,671 --> 02:52:55,834
ORION: Right before things happen, I'll cast
Blur.

3430
02:52:55,834 --> 02:52:57,714
MATT: Okay.

3431
02:52:57,714 --> 02:53:00,190
You cast Blur on yourself.

3432
02:53:00,315 --> 02:53:02,440
MARISHA: I cast Stoneskin on myself

3433
02:53:02,440 --> 02:53:03,800
TRAVIS: Does anybody else want Death Ward?

3434
02:53:03,800 --> 02:53:07,284
ASHLEY: I am gonna cast Death Ward on Grog and on
Vax.

3435
02:53:07,284 --> 02:53:08,345
MATT: Vax?

3436
02:53:08,345 --> 02:53:09,621
SAM: Vex or Vax?

3437
02:53:09,621 --> 02:53:10,525
ASHLEY: Vax.

3438
02:53:10,525 --> 02:53:15,271
MATT: Vax, okay, so Death Ward. Mark that Death
Ward on both you guys. Keep that in mind. I am not

3439
02:53:15,271 --> 02:53:19,056
gonna keep track of that for you. It means next
time you go to zero hit points it brings you to

3440
02:53:19,056 --> 02:53:28,010
one, then it's gone. All right, guys. You cast
Blur on yourself, hold out the mouse, aim.

3441
02:53:28,010 --> 02:53:30,357
ORION: I going to aim and--

3442
02:53:30,357 --> 02:53:32,686
LAURA: Un-Polymorph him.

3443
02:53:32,686 --> 02:53:34,134
SAM: When he falls.

3444
02:53:34,134 --> 02:53:39,455
TRAVIS: Right as he lets him go. We need the
mass.

3445
02:53:39,455 --> 02:53:41,279
SAM: (yelps) Un-Polymorph!

3446
02:53:41,279 --> 02:53:45,749
MATT: Okay, as the mouse descends out of the
middle of the air, the Fomorian goes tumbling

3447
02:53:46,049 --> 02:53:49,443
down, angrily cascading towards it.

3448
02:53:49,443 --> 02:53:52,566
SAM: It's a falling giant.

3449
02:53:52,566 --> 02:53:55,216
ASHLEY: Do we have anything that is gonna stop us
from falling towards our death?

3450
02:53:55,216 --> 02:53:56,887
ALL: We're on the side.

3451
02:53:56,887 --> 02:54:06,718
MATT: With a deafening crash sound, the Fomorian
goes slamming into the glass. You hear the

3452
02:54:06,718 --> 02:54:13,044
cracking and crashing sound of the planes as they
shatter. The metal structure-- this horrible

3453
02:54:13,136 --> 02:54:20,579
breaking, bending sound as they bend inward and
slam the inside of the temple. The Fomorian, who's

3454
02:54:20,579 --> 02:54:27,459
streaking down, slams into the ground from that
height, taking--

3455
02:54:27,459 --> 02:54:31,004
SAM: The German judge doesn't like it.

3456
02:54:31,004 --> 02:54:32,981
ASHLEY: 4.2.

3457
02:54:32,981 --> 02:54:41,561
MATT: At that height, he is dead, even at his hit
point level, he is right there on the ground.

3458
02:54:41,561 --> 02:54:45,647
SAM: But because he is enchanted he can still
attack, right?

3459
02:54:45,647 --> 02:54:49,717
LAURA: Well, we splattered a giant, you guys.

3460
02:54:49,717 --> 02:54:52,486
MARISHA: Oh, is he dead?

3461
02:54:52,486 --> 02:54:54,380
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. He's meat.

3462
02:54:54,380 --> 02:55:01,455
MATT: So as that happens, the entire structure
tilts to the side. Part of it bends and kinda hits

3463
02:55:01,455 --> 02:55:06,231
the side of the temple, and whatever strange green
glow was at the top of the temple dissipates.

3464
02:55:06,231 --> 02:55:07,797
TALIESIN: Yeah!

3465
02:55:07,797 --> 02:55:09,178
MARISHA: Maybe we should just go?

3466
02:55:09,178 --> 02:55:10,370
ORION: I swoop down and pick everybody up.

3467
02:55:10,370 --> 02:55:11,324
LAURA: Pick who up?

3468
02:55:11,324 --> 02:55:12,457
SAM: Not me, you don't pick me up. (laughs)

3469
02:55:12,457 --> 02:55:13,783
MATT: All right. You're way up here right now.

3470
02:55:13,783 --> 02:55:14,857
ORION: I know, I'm going to start to--

3471
02:55:14,857 --> 02:55:17,663
MATT: Start making your way down. All right,
everyone roll initiative, because K'Varn turns

3472
02:55:17,663 --> 02:55:24,765
around immediately, and you hear this very
familiar, deep voice echoing from within the

3473
02:55:24,765 --> 02:55:31,509
chamber: "Naughty, naughty. I left the door open
for you!"

3474
02:55:31,509 --> 02:55:34,001
Everyone roll initiative.

3475
02:55:34,099 --> 02:55:36,508
MARISHA: What'd he say? I left the door open for
you?

3476
02:55:36,508 --> 02:55:38,277
TRAVIS: He wanted us to come in through the
bottom, probably.

3477
02:55:38,277 --> 02:55:40,124
LAURA: But we can hide over the edge so he can't
see us, right?

3478
02:55:40,124 --> 02:55:44,242
TRAVIS: Fuck, balls, tits, ass.

3479
02:55:44,242 --> 02:55:49,465
MATT: All right, so. Go ahead and-- We have 25 to
20, guys?

3480
02:55:49,465 --> 02:55:51,067
TRAVIS: 20.

3481
02:55:51,067 --> 02:55:52,897
MARISHA: Are we leaving?

3482
02:55:52,897 --> 02:55:56,162
MATT: 20 to 15?

3483
02:55:56,162 --> 02:55:57,197
ORION: 19.

3484
02:55:57,197 --> 02:55:58,084
MATT: 19?

3485
02:55:58,084 --> 02:55:59,190
LIAM: 17.

3486
02:55:59,190 --> 02:56:00,505
LAURA: 16.

3487
02:56:00,505 --> 02:56:09,757
MATT: All right. 15 to ten?

3488
02:56:09,757 --> 02:56:11,410
TALIESIN: Ten.

3489
02:56:11,410 --> 02:56:14,125
MATT: Ten to five?

3490
02:56:14,125 --> 02:56:16,455
ASHLEY: Seven. (laughs)

3491
02:56:16,455 --> 02:56:19,334
MARISHA: Nine.

3492
02:56:19,334 --> 02:56:22,438
MATT: What'd you roll?

3493
02:56:22,438 --> 02:56:24,358
TALIESIN: Ten.

3494
02:56:24,358 --> 02:56:27,607
SAM: Two.

3495
02:56:27,607 --> 02:56:29,641
MATT: Pike, what'd you get?

3496
02:56:29,641 --> 02:56:30,703
ASHLEY: Seven.

3497
02:56:30,703 --> 02:56:32,809
MATT: Pike, seven.

3498
02:56:32,809 --> 02:56:34,449
ASHLEY: That's okay.

3499
02:56:34,449 --> 02:56:38,013
MATT: Oh man.

3500
02:56:38,013 --> 02:56:45,245
ASHLEY: Why are you "oh man"-ing? Is that a good
"oh man" or a bad "oh man"?

3501
02:56:45,245 --> 02:56:48,199
TALIESIN: That's a "he attacks first."

3502
02:56:48,199 --> 02:56:51,897
MATT: That was-- No no, that was a "Kima going
last."

3503
02:56:51,897 --> 02:56:55,113
ORION: Everyone use the rope. It's time to leave.

3504
02:56:55,113 --> 02:56:57,029
MATT: All right. Grog, you're up first.

3505
02:56:57,029 --> 02:56:59,296
TRAVIS: Who's behind-- Can I see who's behind me
in initiative?

3506
02:56:59,296 --> 02:57:03,888
MATT: You don't know. It's your turn. Most
everyone's behind you, technically.

3507
02:57:03,888 --> 02:57:11,820
TRAVIS: So, with the climbing harness and the
rope, I speed-rope into the room and take cover

3508
02:57:11,820 --> 02:57:16,314
behind the pool. Can I hide behind the pool on the
opposite side of-- Yeah.

3509
02:57:16,314 --> 02:57:18,057
MATT: So you land there.

3510
02:57:18,057 --> 02:57:20,116
TRAVIS: Opposite of him so I can, like, hide
behind the pool.

3511
02:57:20,116 --> 02:57:22,388
MATT: All right. Kind of swing around, you end up
in that area there.

3512
02:57:22,388 --> 02:57:24,160
TRAVIS: Yeah. Like, even going prone if I have
to.

3513
02:57:24,160 --> 02:57:25,992
MATT: You're-- Ugh, it's hard to hide you.

3514
02:57:25,992 --> 02:57:29,026
LAURA: What about the giant? Can you hide behind
the giant splatter?

3515
02:57:29,026 --> 02:57:32,269
MATT: Yeah, he's already landed. So that's your
movement.

3516
02:57:32,269 --> 02:57:33,506
TRAVIS: Yep.

3517
02:57:33,506 --> 02:57:34,648
MATT: You've landed.

3518
02:57:34,648 --> 02:57:35,614
TRAVIS: That's it.

3519
02:57:35,614 --> 02:57:39,179
MATT: You can see, now, the giant beholder
standing with his metal plates kind of haphazardly

3520
02:57:39,179 --> 02:57:44,361
bolted onto its body and a giant horn curving
upward in front. The eye focuses on you, its pale

3521
02:57:44,361 --> 02:57:50,850
blue color looking at you with a menacing anger.
The strange sense of joy and playfulness. It's

3522
02:57:50,850 --> 02:57:53,487
awful to behold. That's all you're doing your
turn?

3523
02:57:53,487 --> 02:57:56,930
TRAVIS: Yeah, can I bury my face in my arms like
this, on the ground? Like this?

3524
02:57:56,930 --> 02:57:58,103
It's like, face down.

3525
02:57:58,103 --> 02:58:02,092
MATT: Certainly try. Certainly try that. Tiberius.
You are coming down

3526
02:58:02,092 --> 02:58:03,648
as fast as you can on the carpet?

3527
02:58:03,648 --> 02:58:04,513
ORION: Yes.

3528
02:58:04,513 --> 02:58:06,704
MATT: You get about halfway to the top of the
temple with your turn.

3529
02:58:06,704 --> 02:58:07,702
ORION: Yes.

3530
02:58:07,702 --> 02:58:09,485
MATT: Vax.

3531
02:58:09,485 --> 02:58:11,981
ORION: Wait, that's all I can do?

3532
02:58:11,981 --> 02:58:17,483
MATT: Yeah. That's using your whole round to just
fly down with the carpet.

3533
02:58:17,483 --> 02:58:23,101
LIAM: All right, I'm going to-- I'm hasted, I'm
going to throw three daggers

3534
02:58:23,101 --> 02:58:25,017
down at him from here.

3535
02:58:25,017 --> 02:58:27,489
MATT: Okay. At this distance, you are at
disadvantage on the attacks,

3536
02:58:27,489 --> 02:58:28,896
'cause it's too far away.

3537
02:58:28,896 --> 02:58:29,644
LIAM: Okay.

3538
02:58:29,644 --> 02:58:31,036
MATT: So go ahead and--

3539
02:58:31,036 --> 02:58:36,853
LIAM: Okay, so for each attack, too. So where's
my-- Okay, that misses-- Well, five. That's a 16?

3540
02:58:36,853 --> 02:58:38,211
MATT: 16 misses.

3541
02:58:38,211 --> 02:58:41,756
LIAM: 21.

3542
02:58:41,756 --> 02:58:43,314
MATT: 21 hits.

3543
02:58:43,314 --> 02:58:46,385
LIAM: Okay. And the last one, I'm just going to
roll it now, is a 17.

3544
02:58:46,385 --> 02:58:47,723
MATT: 17 misses.

3545
02:58:47,723 --> 02:58:50,402
LIAM: Okay. So the-- I'm hitting him with poison
dagger.

3546
02:58:50,402 --> 02:58:57,653
MATT: All right. You do attack before he does this turn.
Does that do something with an Assassin?

3547
02:58:57,653 --> 02:59:02,037
LIAM: Yeah, advantage, well, advantage on attack
rolls on enemies who haven't taken a turn yet. Any

3548
02:59:02,037 --> 02:59:05,886
hit on-- is a crit. Any hit on a surprise is a crit.

3549
02:59:05,886 --> 02:59:08,089
MATT: Right, yeah, it's not a surprise. You kind
of blew the surprise with the giant Fomorian

3550
02:59:08,196 --> 02:59:11,414
crashing through the top. So you have one dagger
that hit?

3551
02:59:11,414 --> 02:59:22,295
LIAM: Yep, a poison dagger, which gets three-- is
nine, plus poison with a DC of 15?

3552
02:59:22,295 --> 02:59:27,586
MATT: Okay. All right. He is currently poisoned.

3553
02:59:27,586 --> 02:59:34,613
LIAM: Yes, he takes eight plus ten points of
poison damage. On top of the dagger damage.

3554
02:59:34,613 --> 02:59:37,520
TRAVIS: I love how nobody's saying shit, 'cause
we're all terrified.

3555
02:59:37,520 --> 02:59:39,924
MATT: All right, that ends your turn?

3556
02:59:39,924 --> 02:59:41,455
LIAM: Every roll counts. Yes?

3557
02:59:41,455 --> 02:59:43,607
MATT: All right. That brings us to Vex.

3558
02:59:43,607 --> 02:59:45,637
LAURA: Hunter's Mark.

3559
02:59:45,637 --> 02:59:48,781
MATT: All right, Hunter's Mark is on K'Varn.

3560
02:59:48,781 --> 02:59:55,996
LAURA: Okay, good. So, his eye would cancel out my
Hail of Thorns attack?

3561
02:59:55,996 --> 03:00:00,884
Is that considered, like, one--

3562
03:00:00,884 --> 03:00:02,998
TRAVIS: He's looking at me, he's looking at me.

3563
03:00:02,998 --> 03:00:08,997
LAURA: Okay. Oh, that's true. Okay, then I'm going
to cast Hail of Thorns on him.

3564
03:00:08,997 --> 03:00:13,015
MATT: Okay, so you pull your arrow, your hands
shaking slightly as you see this creature now

3565
03:00:13,015 --> 03:00:18,486
focusing its attention on Grog below. You pull out
the arrow, you focus your magical energy. The

3566
03:00:18,486 --> 03:00:22,783
shaft of the arrow, you know, juts out all these
different thorns and you release it below. Go

3567
03:00:22,783 --> 03:00:24,249
ahead and roll your attack.

3568
03:00:24,249 --> 03:00:28,074
LAURA: Oh. Okay, that's 29.

3569
03:00:28,074 --> 03:00:29,598
MATT: 29 hits.

3570
03:00:29,598 --> 03:00:31,748
LAURA: Okay.

3571
03:00:31,748 --> 03:00:33,241
MATT: Are you doing a secondary attack?

3572
03:00:33,241 --> 03:00:34,177
LAURA: Yes, I am.

3573
03:00:34,177 --> 03:00:36,278
MATT: Go ahead and roll your secondary attack now,
just to get it out of the way.

3574
03:00:36,278 --> 03:00:40,174
LAURA: Okay. The secondary attack I wanted to
shoot through my Bloodseeking Bow, though.

3575
03:00:40,272 --> 03:00:41,628
MATT: All right.

3576
03:00:41,628 --> 03:00:48,504
LAURA: That's probably not going to hit. That's a
13.

3577
03:00:48,504 --> 03:00:51,307
ASHLEY: Can I give a plus ten? War God's
Blessing?

3578
03:00:51,402 --> 03:00:52,904
MATT: You can.

3579
03:00:52,904 --> 03:00:54,317
LAURA: 23.

3580
03:00:54,317 --> 03:00:58,064
MATT: 23 hits. So as you release the first arrow,
you fire the second one. You pull back and the

3581
03:00:58,064 --> 03:01:01,334
shaking in the hand is too intense, and as you're
about to release it, Pike reaches up and touches

3582
03:01:01,334 --> 03:01:05,095
your shoulder with her hand and you can feel the
surge of Sarenrae guide your arrow. Your hand

3583
03:01:05,095 --> 03:01:10,119
straightens and your arrow strikes true to K'Varn.
Go ahead and roll damage for both.

3584
03:01:10,119 --> 03:01:19,864
LAURA: Okay, so I'm casting-- it's a 3rd-level
spell on Hail of Thorns. Ah! Where's my d10s?

3585
03:01:19,864 --> 03:01:23,419
Okay, I'm so nervous. I don't-- I can't find
anything.

3586
03:01:23,419 --> 03:01:24,606
LIAM: There's a d10.

3587
03:01:24,606 --> 03:01:35,681
LAURA: Okay. There's a d10, there's a d10. Okay,
so ten on that, plus Hunter's Mark. Six, so 16.

3588
03:01:35,681 --> 03:01:37,346
MATT: All righty.

3589
03:01:37,346 --> 03:01:45,588
LAURA: That's the first attack. And the second
one-- 14.

3590
03:01:45,588 --> 03:01:47,027
LIAM: It's so quiet in here.

3591
03:01:47,027 --> 03:01:51,443
LAURA: Oh, I know. 14. Oh wait, I get plus two on
that other attack, whatever it was, it was--

3592
03:01:51,443 --> 03:01:54,470
MATT: The damage, right. 18. Okay. Yeah, your
bracers give you plus two

3593
03:01:54,470 --> 03:01:56,334
to all those damage rolls.

3594
03:01:56,334 --> 03:02:04,932
LAURA: 16 plus Hunter's Mark. I'm sorry, my brain.
Huh?

3595
03:02:04,932 --> 03:02:07,435
ASHLEY: You were 16? 19.

3596
03:02:07,435 --> 03:02:08,798
LAURA: Yeah. 19.

3597
03:02:08,798 --> 03:02:09,722
MATT: 19?

3598
03:02:09,722 --> 03:02:12,210
LAURA: And then the Bloodseeking Bow bleeds him.

3599
03:02:12,210 --> 03:02:14,667
MATT: He is currently bleeding.

3600
03:02:14,667 --> 03:02:16,526
LAURA: For ten damage each round.

3601
03:02:16,526 --> 03:02:18,446
MATT: Gotcha. Keep that in mind.

3602
03:02:18,446 --> 03:02:21,201
TRAVIS: He's hurting.

3603
03:02:21,201 --> 03:02:25,954
SAM: Question, sorry. What happened to the big
mind-control device? Is that disabled?

3604
03:02:25,954 --> 03:02:29,127
MATT: It's currently hanging right now. Seemingly
disabled.

3605
03:02:29,127 --> 03:02:32,370
SAM: So the mind flayers, as far as we know, might
not even be under--

3606
03:02:32,370 --> 03:02:34,434
LAURA: Might not be, right. Potentially.

3607
03:02:34,434 --> 03:02:35,434
SAM: Okay.

3608
03:02:35,434 --> 03:02:37,586
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Vex.

3609
03:02:37,586 --> 03:02:43,444
LAURA: Oh, and I duck back as much as I can so I'm
out of his sightline. Can I back up on the wall?

3610
03:02:43,444 --> 03:02:46,967
MATT: You step back. It's a five-foot space.
You're having to like, lean, and as you look back,

3611
03:02:46,967 --> 03:02:48,632
like, it's a long slope.

3612
03:02:48,632 --> 03:02:50,065
LAURA: I crouch down.

3613
03:02:50,065 --> 03:02:57,016
MATT: Okay. All right, so, K'Varn starts K'Varn's
turn. K'Varn, now, with like the poison coursing

3614
03:02:57,016 --> 03:03:00,733
through its body, kind of just looks about and
kind of shakes for a second, the eye stalks kind

3615
03:03:00,733 --> 03:03:06,901
of looking in different directions, and just goes,
(laughs) "I want to play." And begins to drift up

3616
03:03:06,901 --> 03:03:08,177
into the air.

3617
03:03:08,177 --> 03:03:10,998
LAURA: Oh, good. He can fly.

3618
03:03:10,998 --> 03:03:18,227
ASHLEY: I didn't know that. That's cool. Maybe we
can get him out?

3619
03:03:18,227 --> 03:03:23,791
MATT: K'Varn moves up. At which point, you guys
who were ducking down off to the side, K'Varn

3620
03:03:23,791 --> 03:03:26,427
comes into sight as he drifts up towards the top.

3621
03:03:26,427 --> 03:03:28,307
TRAVIS: (sings) Shit, shit, shit.

3622
03:03:28,307 --> 03:03:31,176
LAURA: Where's, like the thing that fell? Is it
blocking any sort of--

3623
03:03:31,176 --> 03:03:34,262
MATT: No, it's at this angle right here. It's
basically, kind of,

3624
03:03:34,262 --> 03:03:37,742
following the temple ceiling there.

3625
03:03:37,742 --> 03:03:39,922
SAM: We might have to get Grog out of there
somehow.

3626
03:03:39,922 --> 03:03:43,316
MATT: So, first things first. It's going to fire
its first ray.

3627
03:03:43,316 --> 03:03:46,959
TRAVIS: And it gets three eyes every turn.

3628
03:03:46,959 --> 03:03:49,590
SAM: We need to run.

3629
03:03:49,590 --> 03:03:55,512
MATT: All right, so. One of the eyes whips around.
It aims at-- Let's see. This would be at Percy.

3630
03:03:55,512 --> 03:04:00,502
Percy, go ahead and make a wisdom-- No, this would
be a dexterity saving throw.

3631
03:04:00,502 --> 03:04:03,784
TALIESIN: 24.

3632
03:04:03,784 --> 03:04:07,664
MATT: 24. You manage to just duck out of the way
as this kind of whitish-gray beam of energy goes

3633
03:04:07,664 --> 03:04:18,637
(tsch)! And shoots out from the top of the temple.
A secondary ray-- All right. Secondary ray is

3634
03:04:18,637 --> 03:04:23,882
going to go ahead and fire at-- (sighs) Pike.

3635
03:04:23,882 --> 03:04:26,084
ASHLEY: Me already? I was at seven.

3636
03:04:26,084 --> 03:04:28,581
LAURA: It's aiming at you.

3637
03:04:28,581 --> 03:04:31,061
ASHLEY: You're aiming at-- Sorry, I just got so
scared, I heard my name.

3638
03:04:31,061 --> 03:04:36,042
MATT: Another beam of-- Another beam shoots out.
Go ahead and make a strength saving throw.

3639
03:04:36,042 --> 03:04:39,067
ASHLEY: A strength saving throw.

3640
03:04:39,067 --> 03:04:45,742
Okay. What would that-- What is that? Oh
no, okay, I see. 12?

3641
03:04:45,742 --> 03:04:46,971
MATT: 12.

3642
03:04:46,971 --> 03:04:49,044
SAM: You have Inspiration. Should you need it.

3643
03:04:49,044 --> 03:04:50,290
ASHLEY: Oh. Okay.

3644
03:04:50,290 --> 03:04:52,178
MATT: Yeah, you can add your Inspiration dice to a
saving throw if you'd like.

3645
03:04:52,178 --> 03:04:53,274
ASHLEY: You can?

3646
03:04:53,274 --> 03:04:54,583
MATT: Up to you.

3647
03:04:54,583 --> 03:04:57,052
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll do it.

3648
03:04:57,052 --> 03:05:00,111
MATT: All right, so it's a 12, plus a d10. Go
ahead and roll a d10.

3649
03:05:00,111 --> 03:05:01,946
ASHLEY: A d10. That's a ten?

3650
03:05:01,986 --> 03:05:04,181
LAURA: That's a d10.

3651
03:05:04,181 --> 03:05:05,479
ASHLEY: Two.

3652
03:05:05,479 --> 03:05:06,770
MATT: A 14.

3653
03:05:06,770 --> 03:05:08,103
ASHLEY: That's a 14?

3654
03:05:08,103 --> 03:05:13,828
MATT: So, as you bring your shield up to defend,
this strange kind of grayish-green ray slams into

3655
03:05:13,828 --> 03:05:17,885
you and you feel weightless for a moment, as, all
of a sudden, you're lifted off your feet and

3656
03:05:17,885 --> 03:05:27,578
carried down into the chamber, floating,
restrained. Unable to move. And you're just kind

3657
03:05:27,578 --> 03:05:30,140
of floating in midair right there, right now.

3658
03:05:30,140 --> 03:05:31,753
ASHLEY: Okay.

3659
03:05:31,753 --> 03:05:36,468
MATT: And then the beam releases you. Go ahead and
make an athletics check.

3660
03:05:36,468 --> 03:05:37,688
MARISHA: Come on, Pike.

3661
03:05:37,688 --> 03:05:39,212
MATT: With disadvantage, 'cause you're in heavy
mail.

3662
03:05:39,212 --> 03:05:48,681
ASHLEY: Okay. (nervous laugh) What was it,
athletics? A five.

3663
03:05:48,681 --> 03:05:50,792
MATT: Acrobatics, technically. Sorry, my fault.

3664
03:05:50,792 --> 03:05:52,471
ASHLEY: Oh, four. (laughs)

3665
03:05:52,471 --> 03:05:54,019
MATT: Four. All right.

3666
03:05:54,019 --> 03:05:55,909
SAM: Thanks for the clarification.

3667
03:05:55,909 --> 03:06:02,384
MATT: All right, you take 23 points of damage as
you plummet, slamming on your back on the ground

3668
03:06:02,384 --> 03:06:04,224
and you're currently prone.

3669
03:06:04,224 --> 03:06:07,599
ASHLEY: Okay. Things are going well.

3670
03:06:07,599 --> 03:06:19,556
MATT: The third ray-- All right. The third ray
streaks up and is going to slam into you, Vax. Go

3671
03:06:19,556 --> 03:06:23,680
ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw.

3672
03:06:23,680 --> 03:06:28,064
LIAM: Okay. 24.

3673
03:06:28,064 --> 03:06:34,822
MATT: 24. You see this deep bluish ray come
shooting up towards you. You pull out of the way

3674
03:06:34,822 --> 03:06:38,985
and it slams into a part of the broken metal
that's left over. As it hits the metal, you see

3675
03:06:38,985 --> 03:06:40,797
the metal turn to stone.

3676
03:06:40,797 --> 03:06:41,621
LIAM: Fuck!

3677
03:06:41,621 --> 03:06:49,210
MATT: You manage to just pull out of the way of
the blast. That's going to end K'Varn's turn. That

3678
03:06:49,210 --> 03:06:51,422
brings us to Clarota.

3679
03:06:51,422 --> 03:06:52,565
LAURA: Come on, Clarota.

3680
03:06:52,565 --> 03:06:54,998
ORION: No, Clarota!

3681
03:06:54,998 --> 03:06:59,588
MATT: Lifts off-- to hover down into the other--
gets to about--

3682
03:06:59,588 --> 03:07:01,985
LIAM: What you've been waiting for, Clarota.

3683
03:07:01,985 --> 03:07:06,432
MATT: We'll say, for the purposes of this, just
for-- 'cause I don't have enough things to put up

3684
03:07:06,432 --> 03:07:11,841
here. We'll say Clarota eventually-- At his turn--
Float from the bottom. We'll say, we'll say nearby

3685
03:07:11,841 --> 03:07:28,666
over here. The face-- he's going to go into the
Mind Blast. Okay. As Clarota lands next to it,

3686
03:07:28,666 --> 03:07:33,887
grabs the side of its head and attempts to Mind
Blast as a cone in front. K'Varn just turns and

3687
03:07:33,887 --> 03:07:41,888
laughs in Clarota's face. (laughs) "Your kind has
tried so many times." Big old toothy grin pulls

3688
03:07:41,888 --> 03:07:45,766
across the front of the beholder. That ends
Clarota's turn. Percy, you're up.

3689
03:07:45,766 --> 03:07:51,018
TALIESIN: Okay. There's still a-- Two questions.
There's still a stick floating in midair with a

3690
03:07:51,018 --> 03:07:52,497
rope tied to it, correct?

3691
03:07:52,497 --> 03:07:53,525
MATT: Correct.

3692
03:07:53,525 --> 03:08:00,902
TALIESIN: That's fantastic. I have a plan. Also,
I've been curious about Targeting Shot-- If I use

3693
03:08:00,902 --> 03:08:04,291
a Drop Targeting shot, that won't work on him,
will it?

3694
03:08:04,291 --> 03:08:06,963
MATT: Oh, the one that knocks him prone?

3695
03:08:06,963 --> 03:08:11,075
TALIESIN: The one that knocks flying targets down
to the ground and then they fall.

3696
03:08:11,075 --> 03:08:17,389
MATT: The Wing Shot, I would say that would cause
him to plummet a little bit.

3697
03:08:17,389 --> 03:08:22,817
TALIESIN: But it wouldn't do what it says I can do
here, where he's going to hit the ground.

3698
03:08:22,817 --> 03:08:27,787
MATT: Not necessarily. Due to the nature, you
could lower his current position in the room, but

3699
03:08:27,787 --> 03:08:31,510
his floating nature wouldn't allow him to
necessarily take a lot of damage from that.

3700
03:08:31,510 --> 03:08:41,225
TALIESIN: I will hold off on that-- Okay so, I
will, just-- I'm going to do a Targeted head shot.

3701
03:08:41,225 --> 03:08:45,072
I'm going to grab the rope with my bonus action--

3702
03:08:45,072 --> 03:08:46,175
MATT: All right.

3703
03:08:46,175 --> 03:08:48,448
TALIESIN: I'm pulling out--

3704
03:08:48,448 --> 03:08:50,145
ORION: Shoot the damn eye!

3705
03:08:50,145 --> 03:08:53,040
TALIESIN: Oh yes. I'm pulling out the Bad News.

3706
03:08:53,040 --> 03:08:54,367
MATT: Okay.

3707
03:08:54,367 --> 03:08:57,772
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a shot-- Basically
take a Targeted head shot at him.

3708
03:08:57,772 --> 03:08:58,809
MATT: Okay.

3709
03:08:58,809 --> 03:08:59,951
TALIESIN: In the eye.

3710
03:08:59,951 --> 03:09:01,858
MATT: Okay.

3711
03:09:01,858 --> 03:09:07,361
TALIESIN: 29. I think that hits.

3712
03:09:07,361 --> 03:09:08,734
MATT: Will hit.

3713
03:09:08,734 --> 03:09:18,159
TALIESIN: All right. So, this does a couple
things. Where's my-- I know.

3714
03:09:18,159 --> 03:09:19,709
Where the hell are my--

3715
03:09:19,709 --> 03:09:22,692
SAM: Guys, come on. This is like, piece of cake,
there's one guy. There's like eight of us.

3716
03:09:22,692 --> 03:09:26,697
MATT: The poison has worn off. K'Varn is still
bleeding, currently.

3717
03:09:26,697 --> 03:09:30,388
So, how many damage for that?

3718
03:09:30,388 --> 03:09:38,366
TALIESIN: It's only ten points of damage, but the
nice thing that that does, which is that, for the

3719
03:09:38,366 --> 03:09:43,375
rest of his turn, up until the end of his turn, he
has disadvantage on all attacks.

3720
03:09:43,375 --> 03:09:49,010
MATT: Since the rays automatically hit, I'll
consider that those who get hit by the rays will

3721
03:09:49,010 --> 03:09:50,768
have advantage on their saving throw.

3722
03:09:50,768 --> 03:09:54,310
TALIESIN: Excellent. I'm then going to take the
rope, holding on, and I'm basically going to do a

3723
03:09:54,310 --> 03:09:57,709
swing so that I'm out of range for any of his
attacks until my next attack.

3724
03:09:57,709 --> 03:09:59,004
MATT: Okay.

3725
03:09:59,004 --> 03:10:02,681
TALIESIN: I'm not swinging down into the temple,
I'm swinging around the outside of it so that it's--

3726
03:10:02,681 --> 03:10:06,314
MATT: The outside over here? Okay. We'll say
you're over there.

3727
03:10:06,314 --> 03:10:07,413
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3728
03:10:07,413 --> 03:10:09,428
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Percy.
Keyleth, you're up.

3729
03:10:09,428 --> 03:10:18,098
MARISHA: Oh, it's me. This may-- Okay. How big of
a jump is it from me to K'Varn?

3730
03:10:18,098 --> 03:10:25,872
MATT: I'd say, at this distance, it's about a good
50 feet at an angle.

3731
03:10:25,872 --> 03:10:34,140
MARISHA: (laughs) I'm gonna do it. Fuck it.

3732
03:10:34,140 --> 03:10:35,308
MATT: What are you doing?

3733
03:10:35,308 --> 03:10:36,486
TALIESIN: YOLO.

3734
03:10:36,486 --> 03:10:44,080
MARISHA: YOLO! I'm going to run off the carpet and
I'm going to do a swan dive and--

3735
03:10:44,080 --> 03:10:45,707
ORION: She's not on the carpet.

3736
03:10:45,707 --> 03:10:47,640
MATT: You're not on the carpet with Tiberius,
you're on the edge of the platform.

3737
03:10:47,640 --> 03:10:48,702
Tiberius is up here.

3738
03:10:48,702 --> 03:10:50,344
MARISHA: I'm on the edge of the platform--

3739
03:10:50,344 --> 03:10:51,084
MATT: There you go.

3740
03:10:51,084 --> 03:10:55,263
MARISHA: Running, and I'm going to swan dive, and
as I swan dive--

3741
03:10:55,263 --> 03:10:56,786
MATT: Athletics check, first.

3742
03:10:56,786 --> 03:10:58,177
MARISHA: Okay.

3743
03:10:58,177 --> 03:11:01,897
SAM: Yeah, don't fall.

3744
03:11:01,897 --> 03:11:04,889
MARISHA: 15.

3745
03:11:04,889 --> 03:11:08,033
MATT: Okay, all right. So you leap off and swan
dive--

3746
03:11:08,033 --> 03:11:17,793
MARISHA: And as I get closer, mid-swan dive, I'm
gonna turn into my earth elemental, and grab him,

3747
03:11:17,793 --> 03:11:20,563
and take him down with me.

3748
03:11:20,563 --> 03:11:25,621
MATT: All right, go ahead and make a grapple
check. Roll athletics again, with the earth

3749
03:11:25,621 --> 03:11:27,289
elemental's strength.

3750
03:11:27,289 --> 03:11:28,686
TRAVIS: Form tackle this bitch.

3751
03:11:28,686 --> 03:11:29,738
MARISHA: With the earth elemental's strength?

3752
03:11:29,738 --> 03:11:30,668
MATT: Yes.

3753
03:11:30,668 --> 03:11:34,502
MARISHA: Oh, I don't have this book, it's in the
Monster Manual.

3754
03:11:34,502 --> 03:11:36,402
ORION: I'm going to say it's-- The strength is
50.

3755
03:11:36,402 --> 03:11:37,792
SAM: Yeah, I think that's fair.

3756
03:11:37,792 --> 03:11:39,283
TRAVIS: At least five.

3757
03:11:39,283 --> 03:11:41,040
MARISHA: We didn't print this out yet.

3758
03:11:41,040 --> 03:11:45,887
MATT: All right. That would be a strength of 20.
So it's a plus five to the roll for the athletics

3759
03:11:45,887 --> 03:11:48,162
check. What is that?

3760
03:11:48,162 --> 03:11:50,052
MARISHA: I rolled a 19.

3761
03:11:50,052 --> 03:12:03,081
MATT: Okay. All right, so. You grapple onto
K'Varn, holding onto his form. K'Varn is dragged,

3762
03:12:03,081 --> 03:12:10,793
not entirely to the ground, but is reduced to
about that height.

3763
03:12:10,793 --> 03:12:15,654
MARISHA: And right before I swan dive, I go-- I
yelled-- Or, before I transformed, I yell to the

3764
03:12:15,654 --> 03:12:18,722
party, go! Get away!

3765
03:12:18,722 --> 03:12:21,354
LAURA: Oh, Keyleth. We're not leaving.

3766
03:12:21,354 --> 03:12:24,011
MARISHA: Let me be heroic!

3767
03:12:24,011 --> 03:12:31,667
MATT: So you drag K'Varn, now down to just about
like a ten-foot height. And is currently grappled

3768
03:12:31,667 --> 03:12:34,266
on as K'Varn is like (grunts).

3769
03:12:34,266 --> 03:12:38,777
MARISHA: I've got-- Holding onto his eye stalks
and I'm riding him.

3770
03:12:38,777 --> 03:12:41,191
SAM: Okay, let's leave Keyleth here and just go.

3771
03:12:41,191 --> 03:12:42,618
TRAVIS: Yeah, do you mean, Oklahoma? Time to go?

3772
03:12:42,618 --> 03:12:43,533
SAM: Yeah, just go.

3773
03:12:43,533 --> 03:12:44,750
TRAVIS: Okay. Safety word.

3774
03:12:44,750 --> 03:12:46,562
MARISHA: I've got him!

3775
03:12:46,562 --> 03:12:49,957
TALIESIN: Everyone scratch Keyleth off their
T-shirt, now.

3776
03:12:49,957 --> 03:12:51,425
(laughter)

3777
03:12:51,425 --> 03:12:54,966
MATT: Pike, it's your turn.

3778
03:12:54,966 --> 03:13:01,486
ASHLEY: Oh, it's me? Okay, I'm going to-- Oh,
she's grappling him?

3779
03:13:01,486 --> 03:13:02,814
SAM: She's grappling.

3780
03:13:02,814 --> 03:13:04,842
MATT: Yeah. You're prone on the ground, so you
might want to get up.

3781
03:13:04,842 --> 03:13:08,219
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to get up, and then, I
think, probably, it's time to do--

3782
03:13:08,219 --> 03:13:15,083
MARISHA: No, you can-- Don't feel like you
shouldn't hit things because of me. I've got 126

3783
03:13:15,083 --> 03:13:17,715
hit points as an earth elemental and they don't
affect my hit points.

3784
03:13:17,715 --> 03:13:18,809
ASHLEY: They don't?

3785
03:13:18,809 --> 03:13:24,640
MARISHA: Once I hit zero, I go back to whatever
hit points I had. I can act like a tank. Which is

3786
03:13:24,640 --> 03:13:25,951
what I'm doing.

3787
03:13:25,951 --> 03:13:32,345
ASHLEY: Shit. Okay, so if I use the Divine--
Sorry, I just have another question about that,

3788
03:13:32,345 --> 03:13:33,957
where I have the percentage?

3789
03:13:33,957 --> 03:13:34,977
MATT: Yeah.

3790
03:13:34,977 --> 03:13:36,716
ASHLEY: Is it only for that turn?

3791
03:13:36,716 --> 03:13:38,693
MATT: You use it once and you can't use it again
for the rest of the day. That's your action.

3792
03:13:38,693 --> 03:13:42,088
ASHLEY: Then, and then, Sarenrae just intervenes
whenever.

3793
03:13:42,088 --> 03:13:46,295
MATT: You ask what kind of intervention you want,
what kind of aid you want and then I decide how

3794
03:13:46,295 --> 03:13:47,971
that functions.

3795
03:13:47,971 --> 03:13:49,623
TALIESIN: It's a little early, maybe.

3796
03:13:49,623 --> 03:13:54,255
ASHLEY: It's a little early. All right, so you
know what? I'm going to do Flame Strike-- Or,

3797
03:13:54,255 --> 03:14:02,191
sorry, I'm so shaky. What's that? Sacred Flame,
Sacred Flame. I'm so sorry. Sacred Flame?

3798
03:14:02,191 --> 03:14:03,573
MATT: All right.

3799
03:14:03,573 --> 03:14:10,359
ASHLEY: And then I'm going to send it on over to
the beholder.

3800
03:14:10,438 --> 03:14:12,379
MATT: Okay, what's Sacred Flame do?

3801
03:14:12,379 --> 03:14:13,800
LAURA: It's a cantrip.

3802
03:14:13,800 --> 03:14:17,826
ASHLEY: Nope, that's not what I was going to do.
Fuck, I'm so sorry you guys. Where's my--

3803
03:14:17,826 --> 03:14:19,150
SAM: You're the worst.

3804
03:14:19,150 --> 03:14:22,022
ASHLEY: I'm sorry, I know I'm the worst. I had
something else-- Flame Strike, Flame Strike.

3805
03:14:22,022 --> 03:14:24,372
That's just-- What I just said.

3806
03:14:24,372 --> 03:14:25,972
MATT: Flame Strike, that's a horse of a different
color.

3807
03:14:25,972 --> 03:14:27,232
ASHLEY: Yes, Flame Strike.

3808
03:14:27,330 --> 03:14:29,989
MATT: All right, so. 5th-level Flame Strike,
coming out.

3809
03:14:29,989 --> 03:14:31,781
ASHLEY: Yes. I'm so stressed.

3810
03:14:31,781 --> 03:14:34,595
MATT: A ten-foot radius and a 40-foot high
platform. Where are you creating it?

3811
03:14:34,595 --> 03:14:40,804
ASHLEY: Just right by the beholder. Just right,
right-- Yeah.

3812
03:14:40,880 --> 03:14:42,704
LAURA: Away from Clarota.

3813
03:14:42,704 --> 03:14:44,143
ASHLEY: Clarota's there. God damn it.

3814
03:14:44,143 --> 03:14:46,363
TRAVIS: Fuck Clarota. Smoke that dude.

3815
03:14:46,363 --> 03:14:48,694
LAURA: Maybe up against the wall or something?

3816
03:14:48,694 --> 03:14:51,436
ASHLEY: Nah, I'm going to-- Can I change it? I'm
so sorry. Can I do--

3817
03:14:51,436 --> 03:14:52,896
TRAVIS: Fuck Clarota.

3818
03:14:52,896 --> 03:14:55,781
ASHLEY: Fuck Clarota? No, we can't!

3819
03:14:55,781 --> 03:14:57,073
MATT: What are you doing? Pike, what are you
doing?

3820
03:14:57,073 --> 03:14:57,888
ASHLEY: Guiding Bolt.

3821
03:14:57,888 --> 03:14:58,967
MATT: Guiding Bolt?

3822
03:14:58,967 --> 03:15:00,713
ASHLEY: Sorry guys, sorry guys. (sighs)

3823
03:15:00,713 --> 03:15:02,367
MATT: All right.

3824
03:15:02,367 --> 03:15:03,994
TALIESIN: It's tense. It's cool.

3825
03:15:03,994 --> 03:15:07,016
MATT: Guiding Bolt? Level one Guiding Bolt. All
right, make a ranged spell attack against K'Varn.

3826
03:15:07,016 --> 03:15:09,650
ASHLEY: Okay.

3827
03:15:09,650 --> 03:15:14,806
MATT: It is at a disadvantage because K'Varn is
currently grappled.

3828
03:15:14,806 --> 03:15:19,814
ASHLEY: Okay. So it's a 15.

3829
03:15:19,814 --> 03:15:21,142
MATT: You rolled twice?

3830
03:15:21,142 --> 03:15:22,552
ASHLEY: Oh, I roll twice.

3831
03:15:22,552 --> 03:15:23,783
MATT: Take the lower one.

3832
03:15:23,783 --> 03:15:24,904
ASHLEY: 15.

3833
03:15:24,904 --> 03:15:26,412
MATT: It's a 15, still? Total of 15?

3834
03:15:26,412 --> 03:15:27,858
LAURA: Second one was a 20.

3835
03:15:27,858 --> 03:15:29,144
LIAM: 20 and a 15.

3836
03:15:29,144 --> 03:15:33,439
MATT: So you rolled a 15, and what's your spell
attack? Your spell page?

3837
03:15:33,439 --> 03:15:35,024
ASHLEY: Oh, it's eight.

3838
03:15:35,024 --> 03:15:39,743
MATT: That does hit. All right, so on a hit the
target takes 4d6 radiant damage and the next

3839
03:15:39,743 --> 03:15:47,366
attack roll made against it has advantage, so go
ahead and roll 4d6.

3840
03:15:47,366 --> 03:15:56,985
ASHLEY: 16.

3841
03:15:57,080 --> 03:16:08,960
MATT: 16 damage. All right. So the next attack on
him is at advantage. As a reaction, he's going to

3842
03:16:08,960 --> 03:16:12,594
use one of his legendary actions on its turn to--
as it gets hit and dazed-- one of its eyestalks

3843
03:16:12,594 --> 03:16:16,251
bends over again, the same one that hit you last
time is going to attempt hit you again. Go ahead

3844
03:16:16,251 --> 03:16:17,881
and make a strength saving throw again.

3845
03:16:17,881 --> 03:16:30,664
ASHLEY: He hit me again because I took a long
time. But my strength is really low. 14.

3846
03:16:30,664 --> 03:16:34,901
MATT: 14. The ray slams into you again and you
feel yourself lift off your feet as the beam

3847
03:16:34,901 --> 03:16:40,718
throws you across the room, slamming into the bars
on the side. As you hit them, the impact doesn't

3848
03:16:40,718 --> 03:16:44,699
do enough damage, but suddenly these two giant,
fleshy arms reach through the bars and grab you

3849
03:16:44,699 --> 03:16:46,956
and pull you against them. You take--

3850
03:16:46,956 --> 03:16:50,629
SAM: Oh boy. Our healer is about to die.

3851
03:16:50,629 --> 03:16:52,506
MATT: Nine points of crushing damage.

3852
03:16:52,506 --> 03:16:53,325
ASHLEY: Nine?

3853
03:16:53,325 --> 03:16:55,264
MATT: Yes, and you are currently grappled and held
against the bars.

3854
03:16:55,264 --> 03:16:56,122
ASHLEY: Okay.

3855
03:16:56,122 --> 03:17:01,066
MATT: That ends the legendary action. And I think
you've used your movement to get up. That's your

3856
03:17:01,066 --> 03:17:03,405
turn. That gets us to Scanlan.

3857
03:17:03,405 --> 03:17:06,706
SAM: Boy oh boy. You say you can take a hit?

3858
03:17:06,706 --> 03:17:09,294
MARISHA: Go for it! I'm also immune to a lot of
shit.

3859
03:17:09,294 --> 03:17:15,728
SAM: Okay. Chain Lightning scroll. It's the
biggest thing I have.

3860
03:17:15,728 --> 03:17:19,718
TRAVIS: Yeah! Do it! Whatever that is!

3861
03:17:19,718 --> 03:17:25,275
SAM: It's a scroll of Chain Lightning. I can't
cast it at my level so it's gonna be just a 50-50

3862
03:17:25,275 --> 03:17:27,133
shot whether it even works.

3863
03:17:27,133 --> 03:17:29,630
MATT: So, Scanlan, as you hold over the edge, you
look down and you pull out the scroll and begin

3864
03:17:29,630 --> 03:17:34,659
reading it, hopefully the arcane language will
come to you. Bits of it seem familiar. I need you

3865
03:17:34,659 --> 03:17:40,441
to go ahead and roll a d20 and add your ability
modifier, which is five.

3866
03:17:40,441 --> 03:17:45,456
SAM: Ability modifier. Ten plus five.

3867
03:17:45,456 --> 03:18:01,004
MATT: Ten plus five? The difficulty is 15. As you
finish muttering the spell, the actual scroll

3868
03:18:01,004 --> 03:18:06,811
disappears in your hand and bursts into this
strange array of purple color that then coalesces

3869
03:18:06,811 --> 03:18:11,974
and releases with such force that you're nearly
blown off the top of the temple. A bolt of energy

3870
03:18:11,974 --> 03:18:28,229
shoots out, slams into K'Varn-- I'm gonna look up
Chain Lightning here. 10d8 lightning damage.

3871
03:18:28,229 --> 03:18:35,004
K'Varn does make saving throw, so it's half
damage.

3872
03:18:35,086 --> 03:18:38,617
SAM: Seven, eight, nine-- I need one more.

3873
03:18:38,617 --> 03:18:40,360
TALIESIN: Oh, here.

3874
03:18:40,360 --> 03:18:49,576
SAM: Okay (nervous laugh) someone do math. 15, 20,
21, 25, 30, (clears throat), 44.

3875
03:18:49,576 --> 03:18:52,236
MATT: 24?

3876
03:18:52,236 --> 03:18:53,499
SAM AND TRAVIS: 44.

3877
03:18:53,499 --> 03:19:04,611
MATT: 44! Okay, half that is 22 damage to K'Varn.
I will say you choose the targets. Oh, not

3878
03:19:04,611 --> 03:19:06,383
targets. It's as many as three other targets.

3879
03:19:06,383 --> 03:19:07,474
LAURA: Get those monsters!

3880
03:19:07,474 --> 03:19:10,660
MATT: You can choose not to affect your allies on
this.

3881
03:19:10,660 --> 03:19:13,674
MARISHA: I would appreciate that.

3882
03:19:13,674 --> 03:19:18,491
MATT: But you must be within 30 feet of the
target. Which, yeah, both of those would be.

3883
03:19:18,491 --> 03:19:21,976
SAM: I can choose the other, the other guys in the
cage?

3884
03:19:21,976 --> 03:19:22,873
MATT: Yeah, if you want.

3885
03:19:22,873 --> 03:19:24,622
SAM: In the cages? Yeah! Then yeah, yeah, that!

3886
03:19:24,622 --> 03:19:29,457
MATT: All right. Okay, 22 damage to that guy.

3887
03:19:29,457 --> 03:19:32,479
TALIESIN: He gets it halved as well?

3888
03:19:32,479 --> 03:19:39,132
MATT: And 44 to him. He does not make his saving
throw. He's looking pretty rough. All right, this

3889
03:19:39,132 --> 03:19:40,737
brings it-- that the end of your turn?

3890
03:19:40,737 --> 03:19:42,229
SAM: I have a bonus action.

3891
03:19:42,229 --> 03:19:43,054
MATT: And a move.

3892
03:19:43,054 --> 03:19:52,066
SAM: There's nothing-- Oh, and a move. I think
I'll stick, but as a bonus-- shoot, I've used all

3893
03:19:52,066 --> 03:19:57,737
my Inspiration already, right? I can't do cantrips
as a bonus, right?

3894
03:19:57,737 --> 03:20:00,385
MATT: No, unless it says it's a bonus action.

3895
03:20:00,385 --> 03:20:02,312
SAM: Okay. Then never mind.

3896
03:20:02,312 --> 03:20:10,383
MATT: All right. Kima runs around to where you're
on the side. Grabs the rope from you and says, "I

3897
03:20:10,383 --> 03:20:19,637
"need to do what my destiny tells me to." Takes the
rope, and rappels down. Lands there. She is going

3898
03:20:19,637 --> 03:20:26,635
to go ahead and use her action-- If I get into
combat-- She's going to cast Aura of Vitality on

3899
03:20:26,635 --> 03:20:34,904
herself, which allows her as a bonus action to
heal allies within 30 feet of her. And Pike's

3900
03:20:34,904 --> 03:20:40,343
within-- over there. She casts the spell. Grabbing
her holy symbol, this white light consumes her

3901
03:20:40,343 --> 03:20:46,397
body for a second and creates this kind of gentle
30-foot radial area of divine energy. And she

3902
03:20:46,397 --> 03:20:52,244
looks over at you. Go ahead and-- You heal eight
points of damage.

3903
03:20:52,244 --> 03:20:54,794
ASHLEY: All right, all right. Nice, Kima.

3904
03:20:54,794 --> 03:20:56,015
TRAVIS: Me too, right?

3905
03:20:56,015 --> 03:21:00,283
MATT: No, just-- She can choose one person per
turn. All right, that finishes Kima's turn. At the

3906
03:21:00,283 --> 03:21:01,840
top, Grog, you're up.

3907
03:21:01,840 --> 03:21:04,681
SAM: (Grog voice) I would like to run.

3908
03:21:04,681 --> 03:21:07,292
TRAVIS: Is she-- Is Pike still being grappled?

3909
03:21:07,292 --> 03:21:08,884
MATT: Pike is still being grappled, yes.

3910
03:21:08,884 --> 03:21:11,844
ASHLEY: It's okay, just rage. Just rage, it's
fine.

3911
03:21:11,844 --> 03:21:18,809
TRAVIS: I'm already raging. Can I reach him? Is he
high enough for me to reach? Is he out of my

3912
03:21:18,809 --> 03:21:20,839
grasp, or I won't know until I get there?

3913
03:21:20,839 --> 03:21:22,498
MATT: You won't know until you get there. It's
kind of hard to tell.

3914
03:21:22,498 --> 03:21:32,978
TRAVIS: Fuck it. I run over in a Frenzied Rage.
Whites of the eyes only. And try and just swing

3915
03:21:32,978 --> 03:21:34,562
over my head.

3916
03:21:34,562 --> 03:21:38,975
MATT: He's ten feet up. You're 8'7. With a great
axe, you can reach.

3917
03:21:38,975 --> 03:21:48,069
TRAVIS: Thank you! Thank god. 19 plus, Jesus. 27?

3918
03:21:48,069 --> 03:21:49,612
MATT: 27 hits.

3919
03:21:49,612 --> 03:21:54,393
TRAVIS: Should I roll all the attacks, or-- The
attacks right now, and then roll damage

3920
03:21:54,393 --> 03:21:55,983
afterwards?

3921
03:21:55,983 --> 03:21:58,017
MATT: Yeah, roll the attacks now.

3922
03:21:58,017 --> 03:21:59,744
TRAVIS: 22?

3923
03:21:59,744 --> 03:22:00,726
MATT: 22 hits.

3924
03:22:00,726 --> 03:22:02,290
TRAVIS: And 23.

3925
03:22:02,290 --> 03:22:03,635
MATT: Hits.

3926
03:22:03,635 --> 03:22:05,064
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah.

3927
03:22:05,064 --> 03:22:06,954
MATT: To the ground.

3928
03:22:06,954 --> 03:22:15,458
TRAVIS: I know. Yeah, okay. Jesus, what's 14 plus
seven?

3929
03:22:15,458 --> 03:22:17,021
LAURA AND TRAVIS: 21.

3930
03:22:17,021 --> 03:22:18,398
MATT: 21.

3931
03:22:18,398 --> 03:22:30,242
TRAVIS: 29, no, it's-- Yeah, yeah, plus four, 11.
And then 18. So 29 plus-- Oh, sorry, 21 plus 18.

3932
03:22:30,242 --> 03:22:31,835
Somebody keep track of this shit.

3933
03:22:31,835 --> 03:22:34,806
LAURA: 40. No, 39.

3934
03:22:34,806 --> 03:22:42,556
MATT: Each of those attacks is reduced by one
because your axe is currently not magical in the

3935
03:22:42,556 --> 03:22:44,998
front of his anti-magic cone.

3936
03:22:44,998 --> 03:22:48,835
TRAVIS: Right, okay. Two plus--

3937
03:22:48,835 --> 03:22:50,594
MATT: I got those numbers for you.

3938
03:22:50,594 --> 03:22:52,825
TRAVIS: There's one more 'cause it's three strikes
for Frenzied, right?

3939
03:22:52,825 --> 03:22:54,378
MATT: You already-- Those were three strikes.

3940
03:22:54,378 --> 03:22:58,974
TRAVIS: I thought I only did two. Yeah, I only did
two. The third one's not great, so--

3941
03:22:58,974 --> 03:23:03,782
MATT: Oh, it's 20-- Sorry, I heard twenty-- 21,
29, 17, sorry. So that was-- The first attack was 20--

3942
03:23:03,782 --> 03:23:05,564
TRAVIS: 21. The second one was--

3943
03:23:05,564 --> 03:23:08,302
LAURA: 39 was the second one.

3944
03:23:08,302 --> 03:23:09,344
MATT: 39?

3945
03:23:09,344 --> 03:23:10,820
TRAVIS: No, no. It added up to 39.

3946
03:23:10,820 --> 03:23:13,338
LAURA: Oh, the two together added up to 39.

3947
03:23:13,338 --> 03:23:17,257
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm sorry. And then, six-- 13 is the
last one. 13.

3948
03:23:17,257 --> 03:23:18,844
MATT: 13. Okay, gotcha.

3949
03:23:18,844 --> 03:23:20,762
ASHLEY: Grog smash!

3950
03:23:20,762 --> 03:23:31,203
MATT: Okay, cool. All right. That brings us to the
end of your turn. Tiberius, you just now get,

3951
03:23:31,203 --> 03:23:34,624
using your full turn, you can get to where
everyone else is.

3952
03:23:34,624 --> 03:23:38,495
ORION: Yeah, but I can, like, dash and double my
movement speed as well. Which I should've done

3953
03:23:38,495 --> 03:23:41,790
last turn. 'Cause I don't want to go there.

3954
03:23:41,790 --> 03:23:43,703
MATT: It's not your speed, it's the speed of the
carpet.

3955
03:23:43,703 --> 03:23:50,764
ORION: Oh, shit. Okay, well, can I still dash with
that and double that speed of the carpet?

3956
03:23:50,764 --> 03:23:52,788
MATT: The carpet moves at a consistent speed.

3957
03:23:52,788 --> 03:23:54,365
ORION: Okay, well I don't wanna get anywhere near
that.

3958
03:23:54,365 --> 03:23:55,177
MATT: Okay.

3959
03:23:55,177 --> 03:23:59,060
ORION: I actually want to hover around to the city
side. And I want to look and see what's going on

3960
03:23:59,060 --> 03:24:00,589
with the crowd downstairs.

3961
03:24:00,589 --> 03:24:02,011
MATT: Okay, so you'll be hanging over there?

3962
03:24:02,011 --> 03:24:03,126
ORION: Yes.

3963
03:24:03,126 --> 03:24:06,758
MATT: All right. That brings us to Vax.

3964
03:24:06,758 --> 03:24:08,978
LIAM: Are there ropes still going down?

3965
03:24:08,978 --> 03:24:11,549
MATT: There is one rope, currently, that is
attached to the Immovable Rod, yes.

3966
03:24:11,549 --> 03:24:17,256
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to do something stupid. I'm
going to grab the rope. I'm not going to rappel,

3967
03:24:17,256 --> 03:24:18,958
I'm going to grab about-- How high are we up?

3968
03:24:18,958 --> 03:24:23,785
MATT: You are about 50 feet up right now.

3969
03:24:23,785 --> 03:24:27,334
LIAM: 50 feet, all right. I'm going to use my
bonus action to get down to 25 feet and I'm going

3970
03:24:27,334 --> 03:24:31,935
to jump-- But I'm going to jump out in the hopes
of swinging this way,

3971
03:24:31,935 --> 03:24:35,300
and swinging back towards K'Varn.

3972
03:24:35,300 --> 03:24:37,067
LAURA: (laughs) Pendulum.

3973
03:24:37,067 --> 03:24:41,665
LIAM: That's what I want to-- Pendulum at him,
yeah. I want to jump out and go, woo, woo!

3974
03:24:41,665 --> 03:24:46,484
MATT: Okay, so you grab the rope, leap out in that
direction. Catching yourself at 25 feet. That's

3975
03:24:46,484 --> 03:24:50,636
going to be your movement for this whole thing. So
you reach up, you grab it. Go ahead and make an

3976
03:24:50,636 --> 03:24:52,313
athletics check.

3977
03:24:52,313 --> 03:24:53,946
TRAVIS: Come on, man.

3978
03:24:53,946 --> 03:24:55,137
LIAM: Natural 20!

3979
03:24:55,137 --> 03:24:57,278
(cheering)

3980
03:24:57,278 --> 03:25:04,609
MATT: As you leap off the platform, one of the
ropes in your hand, your fingers clutch the rope,

3981
03:25:04,609 --> 03:25:09,364
and you can feel the pain as the rope-burn burns
through your gloves. But you still hit that point

3982
03:25:09,364 --> 03:25:13,768
in time where you latch on at the perfect moment.
For a second, you look right into the face of

3983
03:25:13,768 --> 03:25:22,079
K'Varn. Swing back, and then come forward again.
Straight towards--

3984
03:25:22,079 --> 03:25:26,817
LIAM: Straight towards him. Three knives, because
I have friends right up against him, this is a

3985
03:25:26,817 --> 03:25:28,126
Sneak Attack.

3986
03:25:28,126 --> 03:25:29,536
LAURA: Nice!

3987
03:25:29,536 --> 03:25:30,706
ASHLEY: Yeah!

3988
03:25:30,706 --> 03:25:32,280
TRAVIS: Drop some pain.

3989
03:25:32,280 --> 03:25:34,129
LIAM: Okay. Okay.

3990
03:25:34,129 --> 03:25:38,188
MATT: Remember, your daggers right now are not
magical. Your daggers are not magical.

3991
03:25:38,188 --> 03:25:39,262
LIAM: Fine, that's fine.

3992
03:25:39,262 --> 03:25:40,437
LAURA: (gasps) They won't pop back in your belt.

3993
03:25:40,437 --> 03:25:49,490
LIAM: It's fine. It's fine. Okay, great.
That's great. That's 17, plus-- That's a 28.

3994
03:25:49,726 --> 03:25:51,199
MATT: That hits.

3995
03:25:51,199 --> 03:25:54,752
LIAM: Let's just go ahead and roll-- That's the
to-hit. So let's just go ahead

3996
03:25:54,752 --> 03:25:56,753
and roll damage now.

3997
03:25:56,753 --> 03:25:57,671
MATT: All right.

3998
03:25:57,671 --> 03:26:05,590
LIAM: So there's no plus-- I forget what's added
for, like, my dexterity and what's the magic-- The

3999
03:26:05,590 --> 03:26:10,759
keen-- Oh, it's two for the keen dagger, so one
plus five is six. Now here comes the Sneak Attack

4000
03:26:10,759 --> 03:26:24,874
damage. Six plus-- There's nine, 12, 13, 18, 22
for the first. Oh, and Natural 20 is a crit.

4001
03:26:24,874 --> 03:26:27,059
MATT: That wasn't your hit, that was your attack.
That was your--

4002
03:26:27,059 --> 03:26:28,129
SAM: That was your stealth.

4003
03:26:28,129 --> 03:26:29,259
LAURA: Yeah that was your stealth.

4004
03:26:29,259 --> 03:26:34,956
LIAM: Sorry, I'm vibrating right now. Okay, so the
second attack is a 19 plus-- 29.

4005
03:26:34,956 --> 03:26:36,007
MATT: All right.

4006
03:26:36,007 --> 03:26:43,693
LIAM: So that is a measly four plus five is nine.
And the last one we use jade, and I shouldn't use

4007
03:26:43,769 --> 03:26:46,182
the jade 'cause that didn't hit, I don't think.
14?

4008
03:26:46,262 --> 03:26:47,878
MATT: 14 does not hit, no.

4009
03:26:47,878 --> 03:26:49,868
LIAM: Okay. All right, I'm sitting on the
beholder.

4010
03:26:49,868 --> 03:26:54,875
MATT: All right. You are, like, now on the rope on
the end of a front swing, holding onto it. As its

4011
03:26:54,875 --> 03:26:59,060
final lair-- Final legendary action this turn, as
you slam into it with the Sneak Attack, your

4012
03:26:59,060 --> 03:27:04,956
dagger pulls out as the rope begins pulling you
backward. One of the rays turns to you. I need you

4013
03:27:04,956 --> 03:27:07,766
to go ahead and-- Let me roll here.

4014
03:27:07,766 --> 03:27:08,707
LIAM: Worth it.

4015
03:27:08,707 --> 03:27:09,836
TRAVIS: Yeah, totally worth it.

4016
03:27:09,836 --> 03:27:11,308
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a wisdom saving
throw.

4017
03:27:11,308 --> 03:27:12,996
LIAM: Okay.

4018
03:27:12,996 --> 03:27:14,627
SAM: With advantage.

4019
03:27:14,627 --> 03:27:19,470
LIAM: With advantage? 20.

4020
03:27:19,470 --> 03:27:20,613
MATT: Total 20?

4021
03:27:20,613 --> 03:27:21,734
LIAM: Yeah.

4022
03:27:21,734 --> 03:27:27,139
MATT: All right. You-- The kind of pinkish ray
slams into your side and you feel for a second the

4023
03:27:27,139 --> 03:27:32,191
entire room's color shift as if all of your allies
turn red for a second, and anger fills your body,

4024
03:27:32,191 --> 03:27:37,820
and you shrug it off. You feel the color fade as
your backswing pulls you back.

4025
03:27:37,820 --> 03:27:39,749
LIAM: I love you guys too much.

4026
03:27:39,749 --> 03:27:48,276
MATT: Kind of floating right in the middle there.
Put you there for the time being. All right, that

4027
03:27:48,276 --> 03:27:50,709
brings us to Vex.

4028
03:27:50,709 --> 03:27:55,535
LAURA: Right, well, I'm gonna just do the Hail of
Thorns again.

4029
03:27:55,535 --> 03:27:56,980
MATT: All right.

4030
03:27:56,980 --> 03:28:00,505
LAURA: From above. Yes, as the first attack.

4031
03:28:00,505 --> 03:28:06,608
MATT: You have disadvantage on this attack 'cause
you have an earth elemental currently clutching--

4032
03:28:06,608 --> 03:28:13,211
LAURA: Oh, right. It's a 19?

4033
03:28:13,211 --> 03:28:14,926
MATT: 19 just hits.

4034
03:28:14,926 --> 03:28:26,939
LAURA: Yes! Okay. So that's 3d10. Ugh, what? 28.

4035
03:28:26,939 --> 03:28:29,778
LIAM: Those zeroes look so good.

4036
03:28:29,778 --> 03:28:37,498
LAURA: Yeah, they do. 28, plus I get my two from
my bracers, right? So that's 30, plus my Hunter's

4037
03:28:37,498 --> 03:28:39,934
Mark-- 32 for the first hit.

4038
03:28:39,934 --> 03:28:41,174
MATT: All righty, nice.

4039
03:28:41,174 --> 03:28:47,620
LAURA: And the second-- I wanna do it with the
fire string.

4040
03:28:47,620 --> 03:28:48,698
MATT: Okay.

4041
03:28:48,698 --> 03:28:54,541
LAURA: Okay. Oh, disadvantage. That's-- Oh, that
doesn't hit. Damn it.

4042
03:28:54,541 --> 03:28:55,683
MATT: What was that?

4043
03:28:55,683 --> 03:28:56,683
LAURA: It was a 16.

4044
03:28:56,683 --> 03:28:57,740
MATT: That's gonna miss.

4045
03:28:57,740 --> 03:28:59,972
LAURA: Yeah. So the second attack doesn't hit.

4046
03:28:59,972 --> 03:29:03,563
MATT: So as the first arrow slams into it, sprays
off, and manages to pierce the side that doesn't

4047
03:29:03,563 --> 03:29:09,297
impact Clarota or your druid, second arrow
splinters off the inside of the temple room.

4048
03:29:09,297 --> 03:29:10,863
All right?

4049
03:29:10,863 --> 03:29:14,218
LAURA: Okay. I want to kind of duck down. Do I
still get to move Trinket at all?

4050
03:29:14,218 --> 03:29:15,503
MATT: Yeah, if you want.

4051
03:29:15,503 --> 03:29:17,009
LAURA: He's still got Fly on him?

4052
03:29:17,009 --> 03:29:22,399
MATT: Technically, if you're still maintaining
concentration on that. No no, you cast Blur. So

4053
03:29:22,399 --> 03:29:23,964
he's no longer flying.

4054
03:29:23,964 --> 03:29:26,116
LAURA: He's just hanging out next to me on top of
a roof?

4055
03:29:26,116 --> 03:29:27,356
MATT: Yep.

4056
03:29:27,356 --> 03:29:29,966
LAURA: I just pet Trinket and tell him to duck
down. (laughs)

4057
03:29:29,966 --> 03:29:32,076
MATT: Okay. Trinket's already ducking.

4058
03:29:32,076 --> 03:29:33,815
LAURA: Oh, we're both ducking now.

4059
03:29:33,815 --> 03:29:39,488
MATT: All right, that brings us to K'Varn's turn.
K'Varn takes ten damage from the bleed.

4060
03:29:39,488 --> 03:29:41,567
LIAM: (high-pitched) What about the poison?

4061
03:29:41,567 --> 03:29:54,907
MATT: Poison wore off. All right, so. So let me
see, what was-- What effect is giving him

4062
03:29:54,907 --> 03:29:56,883
disadvantage?

4063
03:29:56,883 --> 03:29:58,720
TALIESIN: That was me.

4064
03:29:58,720 --> 03:30:01,446
MATT: Right, from your head shot. Awesome. All
right, so.

4065
03:30:01,446 --> 03:30:05,818
MARISHA: Also, Pike too, right? Didn't she have an
advantage thing?

4066
03:30:05,916 --> 03:30:07,436
LIAM: It was one-time.

4067
03:30:07,436 --> 03:30:08,496
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4068
03:30:08,496 --> 03:30:13,725
MATT: The first thing he's going-- All right, so,
one beam turns around and sprays this pitch-black

4069
03:30:13,725 --> 03:30:22,700
ray that careens across the room. This one is
going to slam into-- Let's see where it goes. All

4070
03:30:22,700 --> 03:30:28,968
right, that's going to hit Percy. It arcs up. I
need you to go ahead and make a---

4071
03:30:28,968 --> 03:30:32,181
TALIESIN: Do I have cover? I thought I had cover,
but okay.

4072
03:30:32,181 --> 03:30:36,535
MATT: Cover, unfortunately, for these doesn't make
a difference. Rays are magical instant. Need you

4073
03:30:36,535 --> 03:30:40,732
to make a dexterity saving throw with advantage.

4074
03:30:40,732 --> 03:30:45,630
TALIESIN: 20, 15.

4075
03:30:45,630 --> 03:30:50,253
MATT: Yeah, you manage to pull out of the way. A
secondary ray that's black as well but seems to be

4076
03:30:50,253 --> 03:30:54,555
just pinned with shadow that is pulled out of the
air around it, actually gives off this strange

4077
03:30:54,555 --> 03:30:59,155
buzzing sound as it (vrrrrr) across the room.
It's going to go for Grog.

4078
03:30:59,155 --> 03:31:01,647
MARISHA: No, Grog!

4079
03:31:01,647 --> 03:31:03,623
MATT: Grog, I need you to go ahead and make a
dexterity saving throw.

4080
03:31:03,623 --> 03:31:04,554
TALIESIN: With advantage.

4081
03:31:04,554 --> 03:31:06,664
MATT: With advantage.

4082
03:31:06,664 --> 03:31:16,465
TRAVIS: What is that plus?

4083
03:31:16,465 --> 03:31:17,943
MATT: Saving throw at the top of your--

4084
03:31:17,943 --> 03:31:20,492
LAURA: Dexterity.

4085
03:31:20,492 --> 03:31:22,638
TRAVIS: 15.

4086
03:31:22,638 --> 03:31:27,732
MATT: 15? You try and move out of the way but the
beam hits you on the side of your torso. You feel

4087
03:31:27,732 --> 03:31:34,064
a familiar sensation, back when that proto-lich
was drawing the life force from you from the

4088
03:31:34,064 --> 03:31:40,862
phylactery that was sewn in your chest. I need
you-- Nope. You take 55 points of damage.

4089
03:31:40,959 --> 03:31:44,920
ASHLEY: What?

4090
03:31:44,920 --> 03:31:48,316
ORION: Are you surprised? I'm not.

4091
03:31:48,316 --> 03:31:49,583
TALIESIN: You're not in the room.

4092
03:31:49,583 --> 03:31:50,836
ORION: I don't care.

4093
03:31:50,836 --> 03:31:52,728
MARISHA: Oh, stop being so pouty, you knew this
was coming.

4094
03:31:52,728 --> 03:31:53,999
ORION: I'm doing it through here.

4095
03:31:53,999 --> 03:32:02,043
MATT: All right. And this time, a pale greenish
ray comes streaking across. This one's going to be

4096
03:32:02,043 --> 03:32:08,698
aimed at Scanlan. Go ahead and make a dexterity
save with advantage.

4097
03:32:08,698 --> 03:32:10,067
LAURA: Tiberius. Can you rally the illithid?

4098
03:32:10,067 --> 03:32:12,083
ORION: What the hell do you think I'm doing?

4099
03:32:12,083 --> 03:32:13,606
LAURA: Stop being a dick.

4100
03:32:13,606 --> 03:32:15,940
ORION: I'm angry at all of you right now.

4101
03:32:15,940 --> 03:32:16,916
SAM: 18.

4102
03:32:16,916 --> 03:32:18,092
MATT: 18.

4103
03:32:18,092 --> 03:32:20,793
SAM: Because she cast enhance dexterity.

4104
03:32:20,793 --> 03:32:26,124
MATT: That's true. Yeah. So you duck out of the
way and the beam just (shhh) past you.

4105
03:32:26,124 --> 03:32:28,065
SAM: Thank you, Keyleth.

4106
03:32:28,065 --> 03:32:32,510
MARISHA: You're-- Yeah, totally. I don't know what
I did, but you're welcome.

4107
03:32:32,510 --> 03:32:35,745
MATT: As it hits part of the stone nearby you,
wherever the beam hits the stone, the stone is

4108
03:32:35,745 --> 03:32:38,751
just no longer there. It's like it just carved
through it.

4109
03:32:38,751 --> 03:32:39,882
MARISHA: What was this one?

4110
03:32:39,882 --> 03:32:43,169
MATT: Very similar to what Queen Ulara did to the
top of the throne room.

4111
03:32:43,169 --> 03:32:48,360
LIAM: Disintegrate. You could've been dead.

4112
03:32:48,360 --> 03:32:55,075
MATT: As movement, K'Varn's going to try and break
your grapple. Go ahead and make another athletics

4113
03:32:55,075 --> 03:32:58,394
check. Keyleth, athletics check.

4114
03:32:58,394 --> 03:32:59,602
MARISHA: Sorry, I was shell-shocked.

4115
03:32:59,602 --> 03:33:02,925
MATT: Roll, plus five. Roll, plus five. d20 plus
five.

4116
03:33:02,925 --> 03:33:04,465
MARISHA: Okay. 15.

4117
03:33:04,465 --> 03:33:10,144
MATT: 15? K'Varn pushes you off, you lose your
grip and fall, onto your feet,

4118
03:33:10,144 --> 03:33:11,494
but onto the ground there.

4119
03:33:11,494 --> 03:33:12,389
MARISHA: Damn it.

4120
03:33:12,389 --> 03:33:14,718
MATT: K'Varn then goes--

4121
03:33:14,718 --> 03:33:18,139
MARISHA: Wait, do I have advantage for that?
Still? Do I still have advantage for that?

4122
03:33:18,139 --> 03:33:20,305
MATT: No, no. That's only for your saving throws.

4123
03:33:20,305 --> 03:33:21,513
MARISHA: Okay.

4124
03:33:21,513 --> 03:33:31,667
MATT: K'Varn is then going to go ahead and glide
back up. No, actually it's going to be like that.

4125
03:33:31,667 --> 03:33:34,976
SAM: Whew! Grog, you okay?

4126
03:33:34,976 --> 03:33:39,217
TRAVIS: Yeah. (scoffs) But a tickle.

4127
03:33:39,217 --> 03:33:45,444
MATT: That is going to end K'Varn's turn.

4128
03:33:45,444 --> 03:33:47,447
TRAVIS: No one told me he had a lightsaber.

4129
03:33:47,447 --> 03:33:54,727
MATT: K'Varn saves against the bleed, is no longer
bleeding, and he just starts laughing. (laughs) As

4130
03:33:54,727 --> 03:34:01,093
you see, like, black energy seeping in around. And
you can see visible wounds that Grog has left are

4131
03:34:01,093 --> 03:34:07,834
slowly stitching. That brings us to Clarota, who
is still kind of hovering in levitation. Clarota

4132
03:34:07,834 --> 03:34:13,652
comes to the ground and lands, looks up, the
tentacles pull back, brings one hand down and the

4133
03:34:13,652 --> 03:34:18,051
arcane sigils you've seen appear on the hands both
light up. And then releases a bolt of lightning

4134
03:34:18,051 --> 03:34:31,661
energy up into the air towards K'Varn. Okay,
K'Varn does make his dexterity saving throw. Takes

4135
03:34:31,661 --> 03:34:39,496
half-damage on that. That is 18 points of
lightning damage. And he's going to move back to

4136
03:34:39,496 --> 03:34:46,318
there. At the end of Clarota's turn, legendary
action. He's going to use the secondary ray. The

4137
03:34:46,318 --> 03:34:58,849
ray is going to be-- All right. Streaming up
towards the top again. Scanlan, I need you to go

4138
03:34:58,849 --> 03:35:01,748
ahead and make a strength saving throw.

4139
03:35:01,748 --> 03:35:03,725
SAM: Strength?

4140
03:35:03,725 --> 03:35:07,343
MATT: Three rays on its turn and then it gets to
make three individual ray attacks on other

4141
03:35:07,343 --> 03:35:08,544
people's turns.

4142
03:35:08,544 --> 03:35:11,918
TALIESIN: It's still, technically speaking though,
we would still have advantage.

4143
03:35:11,918 --> 03:35:14,240
MATT: Advantage, until your next turn.

4144
03:35:14,240 --> 03:35:16,251
SAM: May I use my Cutting Words?

4145
03:35:16,251 --> 03:35:19,011
MATT: Unfortunately, it isn't an attack roll.

4146
03:35:19,011 --> 03:35:21,920
SAM: It's not an attack, okay. Then a strength
saving throw.

4147
03:35:21,920 --> 03:35:23,082
MATT: With advantage.

4148
03:35:23,082 --> 03:35:30,204
SAM: Oh, With advantage. Oh good. Ee. Not good.
Ten.

4149
03:35:30,204 --> 03:35:37,783
MATT: So a familiar beam streaks up, kind of a
deep green color slams into you. And you feel

4150
03:35:37,783 --> 03:35:44,012
yourself chucked off the top, restrained, and then
pulled down with severe force into the center of

4151
03:35:44,012 --> 03:35:44,969
the temple.

4152
03:35:44,969 --> 03:35:47,433
SAM: Oh, into the room? But I don't want to be in
there.

4153
03:35:47,433 --> 03:35:52,348
MATT: And then the beam releases you. You go
slamming into the ground. Go ahead and make an

4154
03:35:52,348 --> 03:35:57,113
acrobatics roll. You have advantage because of
your dexterity.

4155
03:35:57,113 --> 03:36:02,083
SAM: 17, no 19.

4156
03:36:02,083 --> 03:36:05,600
MATT: 19, okay, you manage to reduce the damage
from the fall somewhat.

4157
03:36:05,600 --> 03:36:12,585
You suffer 11 points of damage. Managing to
land harshly on one knee and foot. You feel that's

4158
03:36:12,585 --> 03:36:15,795
going to suck in the morning.

4159
03:36:15,795 --> 03:36:18,201
SAM: No problem. Easy, easy

4160
03:36:18,201 --> 03:36:19,945
MATT: That ends Clarota's turn. Percy, you're up.

4161
03:36:19,945 --> 03:36:28,717
TALIESIN: All right, I'm taking-- I'm taking
another aimed shot at the-- I'm taking another

4162
03:36:28,717 --> 03:36:32,210
head shot. Straight into the face.

4163
03:36:32,210 --> 03:36:34,397
MATT: Okay.

4164
03:36:34,397 --> 03:36:38,833
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's 29 to hit.

4165
03:36:38,833 --> 03:36:40,855
MATT: 29 to hit. Okay.

4166
03:36:40,855 --> 03:36:42,356
MARISHA: Do you crit on 18?

4167
03:36:42,356 --> 03:36:44,155
TALIESIN: I can't remember. Did we--

4168
03:36:44,155 --> 03:36:45,361
MATT: No, you do not.

4169
03:36:45,361 --> 03:36:54,880
TALIESIN: God damn it. No I don't. So that's 15
points of damage. And he has-- he maintains that

4170
03:36:54,880 --> 03:36:57,512
thing where everyone still has saving throws.

4171
03:36:57,512 --> 03:36:58,685
MATT: All right. Good

4172
03:36:58,685 --> 03:37:00,870
TALIESIN: I'm then, I'm actually going to--

4173
03:37:00,870 --> 03:37:04,345
MATT: I should have done this last round by the
way, as a point. I need you to go ahead and make a

4174
03:37:04,345 --> 03:37:09,086
constitution saving throw. You are firing a Bad
News on a small five-foot platform on top of a

4175
03:37:09,086 --> 03:37:13,221
temple. There is kickback on this. I'm just
keeping tabs on this.

4176
03:37:13,221 --> 03:37:15,143
TALIESIN: Okay, so you are going to need a
constitution saving throw.

4177
03:37:15,143 --> 03:37:17,508
MATT: Constitution save to hold your footing
because that is a big, loud,

4178
03:37:17,508 --> 03:37:19,123
powerful kickback blast.

4179
03:37:19,123 --> 03:37:24,014
TALIESIN: Okay. 17.

4180
03:37:24,014 --> 03:37:30,449
MATT: 17. It blows you back, but you manage to keep
your foot from going over the edge. Keep your

4181
03:37:30,530 --> 03:37:37,104
footing at the top. And reload with your second
attack. All right. Percy, you going to stay where

4182
03:37:37,104 --> 03:37:38,413
you are or going to move?

4183
03:37:38,413 --> 03:37:43,019
TALIESIN: I'm going to duck. I'm going to step
back from from the edge, just so that I'm not in

4184
03:37:43,019 --> 03:37:46,283
its eyeline for a little bit. I'm going to catch a
breather.

4185
03:37:46,283 --> 03:37:47,350
MATT: All right.

4186
03:37:47,350 --> 03:37:54,016
MARISHA: Grog, fastball special? Want me to toss
your ass up there? See if you can

4187
03:37:54,095 --> 03:37:55,739
grapple on to him?

4188
03:37:55,739 --> 03:37:58,971
TRAVIS: Yeah, can you throw me at his side away
from his eyeball?

4189
03:37:58,971 --> 03:38:00,084
MARISHA: I can try, yeah.

4190
03:38:00,084 --> 03:38:01,870
TRAVIS: If not, it doesn't matter.

4191
03:38:01,870 --> 03:38:05,795
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to cheerleader-toss
Grog.

4192
03:38:05,795 --> 03:38:08,339
MATT: Okay.

4193
03:38:08,339 --> 03:38:14,007
MARISHA: So I want to take Grog and push him up
to see if he can essentially

4194
03:38:14,102 --> 03:38:16,287
do what I did to K'Varn.

4195
03:38:16,287 --> 03:38:21,882
MATT: Okay, Grog's turn doesn't come for a while,
for the next round of combat. So you would throw

4196
03:38:21,882 --> 03:38:26,647
Grog and then Grog would come back down. Grog is
just now coming off this series of frenzied

4197
03:38:26,647 --> 03:38:28,109
attacks. So you would--

4198
03:38:28,109 --> 03:38:29,259
TALIESIN: So you would hold your turn until Grog's
turn.

4199
03:38:29,259 --> 03:38:32,514
MARISHA: I would have to hold my turn. 'Cause I
can't reach him, right?

4200
03:38:32,514 --> 03:38:35,129
MATT: No, unfortunately it's just out of reach.

4201
03:38:35,129 --> 03:38:38,273
MARISHA: I probably can't jump to reach him
either. I'll hold my turn, then.

4202
03:38:38,273 --> 03:38:39,424
I'll hold my turn.

4203
03:38:39,424 --> 03:38:43,166
MATT: Hold your turn, all right. 'Til Grog's?

4204
03:38:43,166 --> 03:38:44,905
MARISHA: 'Til Grog's

4205
03:38:44,905 --> 03:38:49,557
MATT: All right. Keyleth out of the line. Back to
the top of the next round. Pike, you're up. You're

4206
03:38:49,557 --> 03:38:50,851
currently (grunts).

4207
03:38:50,851 --> 03:38:52,012
ASHLEY: Can I heal if I'm still grappled?

4208
03:38:52,012 --> 03:38:53,566
MATT: You can, yeah, you just can't move.

4209
03:38:53,566 --> 03:38:56,351
LAURA: You can break the grapple though, right?

4210
03:38:56,351 --> 03:38:59,130
MATT: As a movement, you can break the grapple if
you want to.

4211
03:38:59,130 --> 03:39:02,337
ASHLEY: I'm going try to break the grapple first,
'cause then I can--

4212
03:39:02,337 --> 03:39:06,166
MATT: Make an athletics check, with disadvantage
because you're in plate mail.

4213
03:39:06,166 --> 03:39:12,235
ASHLEY: Eight.

4214
03:39:12,235 --> 03:39:19,906
MATT: Holds on to you and you take three points of
crushing damage as the arms are still pulling you

4215
03:39:19,906 --> 03:39:21,933
against the top. It rolled really poorly.

4216
03:39:21,933 --> 03:39:24,480
ASHLEY: Three points? Okay, so--

4217
03:39:24,480 --> 03:39:27,591
MATT: You still have one action and a bonus action
should you choose to use them.

4218
03:39:27,591 --> 03:39:35,112
ASHLEY: Okay, so, I'm going to do a Mass Cure
Word-- Healing Word.

4219
03:39:35,112 --> 03:39:36,157
MATT: All right.

4220
03:39:36,157 --> 03:39:50,046
ASHLEY: So where's my-- and I'll do it at-- Cure
Wounds, I'm sorry. I am so flummoxed at the

4221
03:39:50,123 --> 03:40:06,603
moment. So nervous for all things. Okay. I'll do
it at-- let's see. 13.

4222
03:40:06,603 --> 03:40:08,401
TALIESIN: I've heard worse ideas.

4223
03:40:08,401 --> 03:40:09,646
MATT: 3d8 plus five.

4224
03:40:09,646 --> 03:40:10,689
ASHLEY: 20.

4225
03:40:10,689 --> 03:40:14,122
MATT: 20. 20 hit points to six creatures in a
30-foot radius.

4226
03:40:14,122 --> 03:40:19,169
So you can get Grog, Scanlan, Keyleth.

4227
03:40:19,169 --> 03:40:20,909
TRAVIS: How many hit points?

4228
03:40:20,909 --> 03:40:23,801
ASHLEY: 20. Is that also including myself?

4229
03:40:23,801 --> 03:40:29,726
MATT: Centered on that point, to each target-- I'd
say you can do it on yourself, yeah.

4230
03:40:29,726 --> 03:40:30,976
ASHLEY: All right.

4231
03:40:30,976 --> 03:40:32,724
SAM: Thank you, Pike.

4232
03:40:32,724 --> 03:40:36,063
MATT: So 20 hit points to Grog, to Scanlan, to
Keyleth.

4233
03:40:36,063 --> 03:40:37,538
MARISHA: Is that temporary hit points?

4234
03:40:37,538 --> 03:40:38,796
MATT: No, she heals you.

4235
03:40:38,796 --> 03:40:39,541
MARISHA: Okay.

4236
03:40:39,541 --> 03:40:40,538
MATT: If you're full, you're fine.

4237
03:40:40,538 --> 03:40:41,289
MARISHA: Yeah.

4238
03:40:41,289 --> 03:40:43,761
MATT: All right. I think that's your turn, Pike.

4239
03:40:43,761 --> 03:40:44,992
ASHLEY: All right.

4240
03:40:44,992 --> 03:40:48,438
MATT: Scanlan, you're up. You're currently
face-down on the ground. Or no, sorry, you're on,

4241
03:40:48,438 --> 03:40:52,058
like, your hurt knee. You're not prone, you manage
to catch yourself up.

4242
03:40:52,058 --> 03:40:57,403
SAM: I stand, I look at the creature. No, I don't
look at the creature. (laughs) I just sort of look

4243
03:40:57,403 --> 03:41:04,122
near the creature, and I will punch it in its face
with Bigby's Hand.

4244
03:41:04,122 --> 03:41:09,609
MATT: All righty, let's go ahead and pull this up
real fast. How does the-- What's the effect on

4245
03:41:09,609 --> 03:41:11,310
that one?

4246
03:41:11,310 --> 03:41:18,255
SAM: Hand is an object that has an AC of 20.
Strength of 26. Blah blah blah.

4247
03:41:18,255 --> 03:41:20,745
MATT: This is the Forceful Hand?

4248
03:41:20,745 --> 03:41:22,376
SAM: It's the Clenched Fist.

4249
03:41:22,376 --> 03:41:23,405
MATT: Clenched Fist.

4250
03:41:23,405 --> 03:41:24,819
SAM: It's a melee attack, it's like--

4251
03:41:24,819 --> 03:41:28,050
MATT: All right, so go ahead and make a melee
attack with your game statistics. So go ahead and

4252
03:41:28,050 --> 03:41:30,090
roll d20.

4253
03:41:30,090 --> 03:41:31,460
SAM: d20.

4254
03:41:31,460 --> 03:41:33,530
MATT: Add your strength modifier and your
proficiency modifier.

4255
03:41:33,530 --> 03:41:37,853
SAM: Ten. (laughs)

4256
03:41:37,853 --> 03:41:39,047
MATT: Ten.

4257
03:41:39,047 --> 03:41:40,156
SAM: Right?

4258
03:41:40,156 --> 03:41:40,970
MATT: Total of ten?

4259
03:41:40,970 --> 03:41:41,584
SAM: Yeah.

4260
03:41:41,584 --> 03:41:43,603
MATT: All right.

4261
03:41:43,603 --> 03:41:45,390
SAM: I'm not very strong.

4262
03:41:45,390 --> 03:41:46,993
ASHLEY: Hey, you know, it's chipping away.
Chipping away.

4263
03:41:46,993 --> 03:41:53,324
MATT: A fist swings down. What you notice is the
fist swings, or swings upward, sorry, at K'Varn,

4264
03:41:53,324 --> 03:42:01,238
who's kind of loosely facing your direction. The
fist crosses the front of his cone and dissipates.

4265
03:42:01,238 --> 03:42:02,609
The spell is nullified.

4266
03:42:02,609 --> 03:42:04,618
TRAVIS: His eye cancelled out magic.

4267
03:42:04,618 --> 03:42:06,142
LAURA: You've gotta go from the side.

4268
03:42:06,142 --> 03:42:12,718
SAM: Damn! All right. Are you still hurting, Grog?
As my bonus action, I'm going to give Grog some

4269
03:42:12,718 --> 03:42:14,083
more healing.

4270
03:42:14,083 --> 03:42:15,360
TRAVIS: All right.

4271
03:42:15,360 --> 03:42:27,841
SAM: Yeah. (sings) So I come to you, with Healing
Words. Now you know what to grow. I don't know.

4272
03:42:27,841 --> 03:42:35,886
Healing Words! All right, so that's 1d4 plus five.
It's not very much. Do I roll for that or does he?

4273
03:42:35,886 --> 03:42:37,571
MATT: You roll for it.

4274
03:42:37,571 --> 03:42:38,807
TRAVIS: 1d4 + five.

4275
03:42:38,807 --> 03:42:40,074
SAM: Ugh, six.

4276
03:42:40,074 --> 03:42:43,462
TRAVIS: Eight. I'll take it. That's eight. That's
great. Oh, you rolled for it.

4277
03:42:43,462 --> 03:42:44,801
SAM: I rolled. You get six.

4278
03:42:44,801 --> 03:42:45,885
TRAVIS: I'll take it.

4279
03:42:45,885 --> 03:42:47,140
MATT: All right.

4280
03:42:47,140 --> 03:42:48,285
TRAVIS: Thank you, Scanlan.

4281
03:42:48,285 --> 03:42:49,536
SAM: Sure.

4282
03:42:49,536 --> 03:42:55,281
MATT: Great. That comes to Kima's turn. Kima,
who's now landed and cast that spell on her is

4283
03:42:55,281 --> 03:43:01,985
going to go ahead and use an ability called Sacred
Weapon. She pulls out the hammer and as she brings

4284
03:43:01,985 --> 03:43:06,485
her hand across it, this divine flame begins to
burn around the base of where she's holding it and

4285
03:43:06,485 --> 03:43:08,816
the giant head of the maul.

4286
03:43:08,816 --> 03:43:10,552
LIAM: Badass.

4287
03:43:10,552 --> 03:43:17,549
MATT: She steps forward to there. Actually, going
to move to the side a little bit, there. That's

4288
03:43:17,549 --> 03:43:25,718
going to be her turn. She shouts out, "Someone
bring it down!" Brings to the top of the round.

4289
03:43:25,718 --> 03:43:27,600
Grog and Keyleth.

4290
03:43:27,600 --> 03:43:30,801
MARISHA: Oh, I'm getting a donut. Hang on. Okay.

4291
03:43:30,801 --> 03:43:33,732
TALIESIN AND ORION: Fastball Special.

4292
03:43:33,732 --> 03:43:38,215
MARISHA: Fastball Special. So, "Gymnast, hyup!"

4293
03:43:38,215 --> 03:43:44,400
MATT: All right, athletics check. Actually, no.
This is a strength check. So just roll and add

4294
03:43:44,400 --> 03:43:45,384
five to it.

4295
03:43:45,384 --> 03:43:47,288
MARISHA: Adds strength. Check. 15.

4296
03:43:47,288 --> 03:43:50,995
MATT: 15. 600 pounds--

4297
03:43:50,995 --> 03:43:52,877
MARISHA: But I'm also a giant earth elemental.

4298
03:43:52,877 --> 03:43:54,912
TRAVIS: You're pretty freaking huge.

4299
03:43:54,912 --> 03:43:55,891
MATT: Right.

4300
03:43:55,891 --> 03:43:57,078
MARISHA: Pretty freaking huge.

4301
03:43:57,078 --> 03:43:57,785
MATT: I know.

4302
03:43:57,785 --> 03:43:59,172
TRAVIS: Not that high up.

4303
03:43:59,172 --> 03:44:03,025
MATT: I would say, you go ahead and roll a
strength check as well, as you're also pushing off

4304
03:44:03,025 --> 03:44:04,033
of her.

4305
03:44:04,033 --> 03:44:06,713
TRAVIS: Fuck yes. 22.

4306
03:44:06,713 --> 03:44:12,364
MATT: 22. Between him pushing off the force of
your hands, you manage to move over, leap in the

4307
03:44:12,364 --> 03:44:15,802
air approximately at his height. Before you
plummet, what are you going to do?

4308
03:44:15,802 --> 03:44:18,377
MARISHA: Horn. Horn. Horn!

4309
03:44:18,377 --> 03:44:20,628
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm going to grab the black horn.

4310
03:44:20,628 --> 03:44:24,304
MATT: All right. You reach out. Go ahead and make
an athletics check.

4311
03:44:24,304 --> 03:44:27,204
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

4312
03:44:27,204 --> 03:44:29,646
(cheering)

4313
03:44:29,646 --> 03:44:37,035
MATT: You grab onto the horn and you're dangling
from it right now. Ugh! You can feel, just to the

4314
03:44:37,035 --> 03:44:41,144
touch of your hand, there's this freezing cold
sensation. As you look up, you can see frost

4315
03:44:41,144 --> 03:44:46,125
beginning to build around the outside of your
fingers. It's immediate frostburn on your fingers,

4316
03:44:46,125 --> 03:44:49,903
but you're holding tight. And you have this giant
eye moving in front of you, rapidly looking

4317
03:44:49,903 --> 03:44:54,630
around angrily. This giant, toothy maw, just behind
you, with a tongue lashing about. And this voice,

4318
03:44:54,733 --> 03:45:00,075
right in your face, going, "Oh, you don't wanna do
that, boy."

4319
03:45:00,075 --> 03:45:03,480
TRAVIS: Well, I have an Intelligence of six. Watch
this.

4320
03:45:03,480 --> 03:45:05,458
MATT: That's your action. What's your bonus
action?

4321
03:45:05,458 --> 03:45:11,231
TRAVIS: Can I grab and kick off and try and rip it
off his head? Or is that all the same thing?

4322
03:45:11,231 --> 03:45:12,897
MATT: You can certainly try.

4323
03:45:12,897 --> 03:45:16,502
TRAVIS: I'll try that. At least trying to kick my
feet into his eye. Maybe it works,

4324
03:45:16,502 --> 03:45:17,729
maybe it doesn't.

4325
03:45:17,729 --> 03:45:18,967
MATT: Strength check.

4326
03:45:18,967 --> 03:45:20,617
LIAM: Natural 20. That's all you gotta do.

4327
03:45:20,617 --> 03:45:22,807
SAM: You have Inspiration.

4328
03:45:22,807 --> 03:45:26,168
TRAVIS: Do I have to do the Inspiration before
I--

4329
03:45:26,168 --> 03:45:27,962
MATT: No, you can do it now, before you know what
the answer would be.

4330
03:45:27,962 --> 03:45:29,547
TRAVIS: And it's ten?

4331
03:45:29,547 --> 03:45:31,836
MATT: Add 1d10 to the roll.

4332
03:45:31,836 --> 03:45:37,656
TRAVIS: It's 16.

4333
03:45:37,656 --> 03:45:44,212
MATT: 16. You grab, you take your feet and you
kick off the front. That thing is wedged in there.

4334
03:45:44,212 --> 03:45:49,058
Your body comes back flat against the Beholder.
You see the eyelid has been closed from the impact

4335
03:45:49,058 --> 03:45:59,891
of your feet, and this horrible snarling sound,
"What are you doing?" So that's your turn. At the

4336
03:45:59,891 --> 03:46:02,238
end of your turn, it's going to go ahead and do
another lair--

4337
03:46:02,238 --> 03:46:04,622
LAURA: You're not in a good spot!

4338
03:46:04,622 --> 03:46:07,341
MATT: Lair action on you. Because you're in its
face, I'm going to say it would give him

4339
03:46:07,341 --> 03:46:11,383
advantage. However, that's negated by him so you
just have a straight roll on this.

4340
03:46:11,383 --> 03:46:13,157
TRAVIS: Okay.

4341
03:46:13,157 --> 03:46:16,053
MATT: I want you to go ahead and make a wisdom
saving throw.

4342
03:46:16,053 --> 03:46:20,222
TRAVIS: All right. Oh shit. 19.

4343
03:46:20,222 --> 03:46:21,811
MATT: 19.

4344
03:46:21,811 --> 03:46:22,832
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4345
03:46:22,832 --> 03:46:31,360
MATT: Damn. For a second, you feel like the force
of K'Varn's mind begins to creep over yours, and

4346
03:46:31,360 --> 03:46:36,310
you feel the urge to suddenly turn to his side.
You shrug it off out of just the general fury and

4347
03:46:36,310 --> 03:46:44,193
anger, realizing that you, wouldn't matter, being
raging, are immune to charm effects. All right,

4348
03:46:44,193 --> 03:46:48,235
that ends your turn. Tiberius? Still over here.

4349
03:46:48,235 --> 03:46:53,438
ORION: As far as, down, as I could have been to
begin with, so even-Steven with those guys.

4350
03:46:53,438 --> 03:46:55,047
MATT: Yeah.

4351
03:46:55,047 --> 03:46:58,233
ORION: What do I see in the town? Do I see a mass
anywhere?

4352
03:46:58,233 --> 03:47:00,414
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

4353
03:47:00,414 --> 03:47:04,460
ORION: Natural 20!

4354
03:47:04,460 --> 03:47:05,831
(cheering)

4355
03:47:05,831 --> 03:47:07,216
TRAVIS: Nice, Tiberius.

4356
03:47:07,216 --> 03:47:11,473
MATT: 20, all right. Looking down, you look about
the city streets and what you can see is

4357
03:47:11,473 --> 03:47:18,057
immediately a swarm of illithids and mind flayers
heading towards the temple.

4358
03:47:18,057 --> 03:47:24,554
ORION: Great, I jump off the carpet. I cast Fly on
myself.

4359
03:47:24,554 --> 03:47:25,546
MATT: All right.

4360
03:47:25,546 --> 03:47:33,381
ORION: I go to where I can just, right, hover-- I
want to hover above them, about 20 feet away. And

4361
03:47:33,381 --> 03:47:42,260
as I come to it, I'm going to flip out the carpet,
get on it, cast Alter Self, turn into Clarota. I'm

4362
03:47:42,260 --> 03:47:44,766
going to keep my original lungs.

4363
03:47:44,766 --> 03:47:46,300
MATT: Okay, hold on. One turn.

4364
03:47:46,300 --> 03:47:50,813
ORION: Yeah. I'm going to-- Yeah, I'll spend
whatever I gotta spend. I'm doing all of it.

4365
03:47:50,813 --> 03:47:55,992
MATT: All right, so, to get to the bottom of the--
You get 20 feet away, you said, which is, you get

4366
03:47:55,992 --> 03:47:59,791
about that far at the end of this turn with the
magic carpet. So you're about there, I'd say, on

4367
03:47:59,791 --> 03:48:05,312
the outside. So you then-- You jump off the
carpet. You turn, you cast Fly on yourself.

4368
03:48:05,312 --> 03:48:08,177
ORION: Can they see me? The crowd that's coming?

4369
03:48:08,177 --> 03:48:12,465
MATT: You don't know that yet. You imagine you're
out in the open, but you don't know if anyone's

4370
03:48:12,465 --> 03:48:13,761
noticed you yet.

4371
03:48:13,761 --> 03:48:15,625
ORION: That's what I-- I'm going to go towards the
crowd. I wanna--

4372
03:48:15,625 --> 03:48:18,983
MATT: Right. But you can only move so fast on the
carpet. You come down to the bottom of--

4373
03:48:18,983 --> 03:48:23,964
ORION: No, I dispelled the carpet so I can do
double my speed so I can get there, and then I

4374
03:48:23,964 --> 03:48:25,976
redo the carpet as I--

4375
03:48:25,976 --> 03:48:29,285
MATT: No, you can't just like grab the carpet and
go down. You have to jump off the carpet, leaving

4376
03:48:29,285 --> 03:48:30,824
the carpet behind.

4377
03:48:30,824 --> 03:48:33,235
ORION: No, I grabbed it. As I'm going with me. I
can't do that?

4378
03:48:33,235 --> 03:48:39,997
MATT: It's a really, really-- It's not like a
boop! It's a six, it's a 15-foot-by-10-foot

4379
03:48:39,997 --> 03:48:41,462
carpet. It's very thick.

4380
03:48:41,462 --> 03:48:43,035
ORION: Well, that's not going to be as cool. Well,
then I'll just stay on the stupid carpet, then.

4381
03:48:43,129 --> 03:48:46,414
MATT: Okay. Just letting you know. You're pretty
much going to have to let the carpet go, or take

4382
03:48:46,478 --> 03:48:51,258
it down slower. So as you coast down, you get to
about this point. You said you cast Fly on

4383
03:48:51,502 --> 03:48:53,401
yourself, or are you just going to go for the
Alter Self?

4384
03:48:53,401 --> 03:48:55,570
ORION: If I'm, like, down at that level then I
don't really have to do that.

4385
03:48:55,570 --> 03:48:56,713
I'll cast Alter Self though.

4386
03:48:56,713 --> 03:48:57,677
MATT: Okay.

4387
03:48:57,677 --> 03:48:58,648
ORION: Turn into Clarota.

4388
03:48:58,648 --> 03:49:03,407
MATT: All right, you're now in the form of a mind
flayer. Covered in rags, with a big old metallic

4389
03:49:03,407 --> 03:49:04,752
head piece.

4390
03:49:04,752 --> 03:49:12,471
ORION: Do I-- actually, sans head piece. Clarota
without the head piece. And what do I see when I

4391
03:49:12,471 --> 03:49:13,743
get down there?

4392
03:49:13,743 --> 03:49:16,917
MATT: As you coast down you can see a group of
what looks like three mind flayers with about

4393
03:49:16,917 --> 03:49:21,948
seven slaves swarming in towards the front of the
temple. They haven't quite noticed you yet.

4394
03:49:21,948 --> 03:49:27,078
ORION: How far away are they?

4395
03:49:27,078 --> 03:49:29,321
MATT: About 30 feet from you.

4396
03:49:29,321 --> 03:49:34,068
ORION: Great. You, over there! Quickly! And I get
their attention.

4397
03:49:34,068 --> 03:49:40,393
MATT: They all stop and look up at you. A look of
confusion, as mind flayers both do not speak

4398
03:49:40,393 --> 03:49:45,883
through language, let alone speak Common out
loud.

4399
03:49:45,883 --> 03:49:51,998
ORION: Look, I took the form of one of your own.
Pretty much to get your attention. We need your

4400
03:49:51,998 --> 03:49:56,957
help. We want to defeat the one who's taken
control over your mind. We are the ones who

4401
03:49:56,957 --> 03:50:02,787
disabled the crystal to begin with. Please come on
this-- With me. We can go much faster.

4402
03:50:02,787 --> 03:50:05,215
Up here, please!

4403
03:50:05,215 --> 03:50:07,666
MATT: You make a persuasion roll.

4404
03:50:07,666 --> 03:50:17,936
ORION: Damn right. Six plus ten. That's 16, plus
nine is-- My persuasion's nine. Plus 16.

4405
03:50:18,018 --> 03:50:19,864
MATT: Wait, what'd you say? 20?

4406
03:50:19,864 --> 03:50:20,794
ORION: Six.

4407
03:50:20,794 --> 03:50:22,336
MATT: Plus ten?

4408
03:50:22,336 --> 03:50:23,658
ORION: Plus nine.

4409
03:50:23,658 --> 03:50:24,942
MATT: Plus nine.

4410
03:50:24,942 --> 03:50:27,070
ORION: That's 25.

4411
03:50:27,070 --> 03:50:29,033
MATT: Okay.

4412
03:50:29,033 --> 03:50:38,174
SAM: You stumped him.

4413
03:50:38,174 --> 03:50:42,013
MATT: There's-- No, there's a really, really,
really fine line here.

4414
03:50:42,013 --> 03:50:43,661
ORION: Oh yes.

4415
03:50:43,661 --> 03:50:46,003
LAURA: They could suck your brain out.

4416
03:50:46,003 --> 03:50:47,882
ORION: Not if they're allies.

4417
03:50:47,882 --> 03:50:49,158
ASHLEY: How many of them are there?

4418
03:50:49,158 --> 03:50:50,375
LIAM AND TALIESIN: Hundreds.

4419
03:50:50,375 --> 03:50:54,617
MATT: Two of them kind of look at each other
confused, and look back. Third one looks up at

4420
03:50:54,617 --> 03:50:58,556
you. And just continues inside the temple.

4421
03:50:58,556 --> 03:51:01,128
ORION: Well, I guess that was something.

4422
03:51:01,128 --> 03:51:04,348
TRAVIS: Yeah, it might've been. You might've
started it.

4423
03:51:04,348 --> 03:51:06,628
MATT: You didn't get Mind Blasted three times.

4424
03:51:06,628 --> 03:51:11,520
ORION: Noticing that, then, I will go to-- I don't
have another movement, right? Or was--

4425
03:51:11,520 --> 03:51:13,074
MATT: No, that's your turn, yo.

4426
03:51:13,074 --> 03:51:14,461
TRAVIS: That's good, though.

4427
03:51:14,461 --> 03:51:15,617
SAM: That was great.

4428
03:51:15,617 --> 03:51:16,714
ORION: That's what I do.

4429
03:51:16,714 --> 03:51:19,566
MATT: All right. Vax, you're up.

4430
03:51:19,566 --> 03:51:26,384
LIAM: All right, I'm going to run-- I'm still
Hasted directly underneath the mind flayer. And

4431
03:51:26,384 --> 03:51:28,543
throw the daggers up.

4432
03:51:28,543 --> 03:51:30,386
MATT: You mean K'Varn?

4433
03:51:30,386 --> 03:51:38,262
LIAM: Yeah. Oh, sorry. Thank you. Yes, and here we
go. Ten. First attack is a 21.

4434
03:51:38,262 --> 03:51:42,029
MATT: All right, with disadvantage on both those
attacks because you currently have Grog dangling

4435
03:51:42,029 --> 03:51:44,137
from the creature.

4436
03:51:44,137 --> 03:51:54,696
LIAM: All right, so, okay. So that one misses.
Second one. That's a 15. Misses, right? And the

4437
03:51:54,696 --> 03:51:57,064
second one, come on, man, is a 20.

4438
03:51:57,064 --> 03:51:58,442
MATT: That does hit.

4439
03:51:58,442 --> 03:52:06,993
LIAM: Okay. That's a dagger into its butt. Three.
And there's no non-magical effect on me at the

4440
03:52:06,993 --> 03:52:10,300
moment, right? 'Cause I'm out of his vision? So
that's a nine?

4441
03:52:10,300 --> 03:52:11,601
MATT: Correct, yep.

4442
03:52:11,601 --> 03:52:12,890
LIAM: Just for damage? Okay.

4443
03:52:12,890 --> 03:52:18,964
MATT: Dagger slams into the bottom. Because you're
out of the eye range, returns to your side. End of

4444
03:52:18,964 --> 03:52:22,932
your turn, it's going to use legendary action.
Final ray.

4445
03:52:22,932 --> 03:52:25,349
LIAM: Come sit on me, dude. Come on down.

4446
03:52:25,349 --> 03:52:34,861
MATT: All right. This stalk now gives off this
weird yellowish-- Like a very faint yellowish

4447
03:52:34,861 --> 03:52:39,827
see-through color, kind of scoops across the
ground, right past you, after you throw the

4448
03:52:39,827 --> 03:52:42,282
dagger. Go ahead and roll a constitution saving
throw.

4449
03:52:42,282 --> 03:52:44,711
LIAM: It's able to-- I just don't know, I'm not
challenging it.

4450
03:52:44,711 --> 03:52:46,462
MATT: It has stalks everywhere.

4451
03:52:46,462 --> 03:52:47,829
LIAM: Even under-- On its tushie?

4452
03:52:47,829 --> 03:52:50,042
MATT: These stalks aim down.

4453
03:52:50,042 --> 03:52:52,291
LIAM: Oh. I was going off that, okay. All right,
so what am I making at the--

4454
03:52:52,291 --> 03:52:53,820
MATT: Constitution saving throw.

4455
03:52:53,820 --> 03:52:55,875
You have advantage, because Percy--

4456
03:52:55,956 --> 03:52:58,482
LIAM: Advantage, 18.

4457
03:52:58,482 --> 03:53:05,596
MATT: 18? All right. You manage to just dodge out
of the way. It crests your arm, and for a second

4458
03:53:05,596 --> 03:53:09,104
you feel the muscles tense up and then you just
shake off the effect.

4459
03:53:09,104 --> 03:53:12,968
All right, that brings us to Vex.

4460
03:53:12,968 --> 03:53:21,371
LAURA: That's me. Okay. I'm going-- Grog is
dangling from him, but I'm still going to try to

4461
03:53:21,371 --> 03:53:27,839
shoot him. I'm going to try to shoot him with the
Ensnare arrow that I have from Percy.

4462
03:53:27,839 --> 03:53:29,311
MATT: Okay.

4463
03:53:29,311 --> 03:53:34,835
LAURA: Try to maybe see if I can tie some of those
stalks down to his head with it. Yeah?

4464
03:53:34,835 --> 03:53:36,238
LIAM: Like a hairnet?

4465
03:53:36,238 --> 03:53:37,463
LAURA: Yeah, like a little hairnet.

4466
03:53:37,463 --> 03:53:39,202
MATT: Make an attack with disadvantage.

4467
03:53:39,202 --> 03:53:48,348
LAURA: The disadvantage was a-- What was that,
20?

4468
03:53:48,348 --> 03:53:51,361
MATT: Total 20? Okay. That hits.

4469
03:53:51,361 --> 03:53:52,396
LAURA: Yes!

4470
03:53:52,396 --> 03:53:53,495
TALIESIN: Science!

4471
03:53:53,495 --> 03:53:55,589
LAURA: Okay, so what do I-- How do I do that? With
the Ensnare arrow?

4472
03:53:55,589 --> 03:53:59,214
MATT: Essentially how it works is it works like a
Tanglefoot bag. It slams into it. You roll damage

4473
03:53:59,214 --> 03:54:05,760
for the arrow, and it bursts over him like a giant
package of globby, thick glue. Just (pfft).

4474
03:54:05,760 --> 03:54:10,167
LAURA: 15, 16, 17. 19.

4475
03:54:10,167 --> 03:54:18,117
MATT: 19 damage. All right. It looks a little
goopy. The purpose of the Tanglefoot bag usually

4476
03:54:18,117 --> 03:54:20,950
is to stick something to something, like a
creature on the ground.

4477
03:54:20,950 --> 03:54:22,091
LAURA: Oh, okay. I didn't know that.

4478
03:54:22,091 --> 03:54:25,974
MATT: So he's got goop on him. Doesn't seem to be
affecting him much. You wanna fire another arrow?

4479
03:54:25,974 --> 03:54:31,241
LAURA: Oh, I thought it was like a sort of
wrap-around-y arrow. It wasn't like a-- I thought

4480
03:54:31,241 --> 03:54:32,277
it was like a--

4481
03:54:32,277 --> 03:54:33,085
MARISHA: Like a bolo?

4482
03:54:33,085 --> 03:54:33,843
LAURA: Yeah.

4483
03:54:33,843 --> 03:54:34,821
TALIESIN: It was a bolo-y thing.

4484
03:54:34,821 --> 03:54:36,102
MATT: Oh, I thought this was the Tanglefoot
arrow.

4485
03:54:36,102 --> 03:54:41,169
TALIESIN: The Tanglefoot was basically like a wire
thing. Yeah, it was a bolo arrow. That's how it--

4486
03:54:41,169 --> 03:54:43,701
That was how I originally pitched it, was a bolo
arrow.

4487
03:54:43,701 --> 03:54:45,411
LAURA: That's what he told me it was a long time
ago.

4488
03:54:45,411 --> 03:54:52,027
MATT: Okay. Then, given that circumstance, the
bolo wraps around him. Bolos--

4489
03:54:52,027 --> 03:54:54,931
LAURA: Hopefully taking some of the stalks,
pinning it to his body?

4490
03:54:54,931 --> 03:54:59,067
MATT: Bolos are used to trap creature's legs when
they're running. Wrap around it.

4491
03:54:59,067 --> 03:55:00,427
They kind of fall over.

4492
03:55:00,427 --> 03:55:01,461
LAURA: Right.

4493
03:55:01,461 --> 03:55:05,767
MATT: It wraps around some of the eyestalks or
parts and doesn't seem to have an additional

4494
03:55:05,767 --> 03:55:10,917
effect than the damage. Unfortunately, it's just--
bolo against beholder it's kind of a square peg in

4495
03:55:10,917 --> 03:55:12,007
a hole.

4496
03:55:12,007 --> 03:55:15,929
LAURA: I know, I was just hoping I could pin a
stalk or two. All right, the second one, with the

4497
03:55:15,929 --> 03:55:18,092
burning bow.

4498
03:55:18,092 --> 03:55:19,329
MATT: All right.

4499
03:55:19,329 --> 03:55:24,611
LAURA: Wasn't that the same thing as the first
one? Oh no.

4500
03:55:24,611 --> 03:55:28,312
LIAM: I didn't see the second one. 17?

4501
03:55:28,312 --> 03:55:43,019
LAURA: 15, 24? Okay, so. Ten, 11, 12. 16 plus ten
for the burning.

4502
03:55:43,019 --> 03:55:44,085
MATT: Okay.

4503
03:55:44,085 --> 03:55:46,811
LAURA: 19.

4504
03:55:46,811 --> 03:55:52,683
MATT: All right, gotcha. Cool. As the arrow
streaks and then slams into his side you see the

4505
03:55:52,683 --> 03:55:56,247
burst of flame begin to burn up its side. And you
can see now, the armored plates on the side of

4506
03:55:56,247 --> 03:56:01,107
K'Varn, some are starting to, like, creak off and
kind of peel off at the side. The damage is

4507
03:56:01,107 --> 03:56:06,627
starting to have a visual impact on K'Varn. You
can see there's bits of beholder blood

4508
03:56:06,627 --> 03:56:09,669
beginning to pour down the side of its
meatball-like torso.

4509
03:56:09,746 --> 03:56:12,547
Is that the end of your turn?

4510
03:56:12,547 --> 03:56:16,004
LAURA: And I duck down again and try to drop out
of his view.

4511
03:56:16,004 --> 03:56:23,954
MATT: That brings it to K'Varn's turn. K'Varn is
going to attempt to shrug you off the horn, Grog.

4512
03:56:23,954 --> 03:56:25,653
MARISHA: Hold on!

4513
03:56:25,653 --> 03:56:28,225
MATT: First it's going to fly up.

4514
03:56:28,225 --> 03:56:30,986
TRAVIS: Oh, great, yeah. That's good.

4515
03:56:30,986 --> 03:56:32,712
MARISHA: It's going to fly up?

4516
03:56:32,712 --> 03:56:34,805
TRAVIS: I had to grab that thing.

4517
03:56:34,805 --> 03:56:39,067
MARISHA: Can I move underneath so I can maybe
catch Grog from where I cheerleader--

4518
03:56:39,067 --> 03:56:40,475
MATT: Unfortunately, right now, no.

4519
03:56:40,475 --> 03:56:42,481
ORION: Why are you cheerleading somebody?

4520
03:56:42,481 --> 03:56:48,552
MARISHA: Prep. Prep for the basket? Because I
imagine it was like a cheerleader.

4521
03:56:48,552 --> 03:56:50,588
MATT: Make an athletics check.

4522
03:56:50,588 --> 03:56:56,522
TRAVIS: 15.

4523
03:56:56,522 --> 03:57:04,702
MATT: 15? K'Varn nudges you. A sheer bit of force.
Your hand lets go and you plummet backward again,

4524
03:57:04,727 --> 03:57:11,448
slamming into the ground. Make an acrobatics check
to try and reduce the damage if you like.

4525
03:57:11,448 --> 03:57:13,663
TRAVIS: 17?

4526
03:57:13,663 --> 03:57:20,313
MATT: All right. You go ahead and slam into the
ground. You manage to reduce the damage somewhat,

4527
03:57:20,313 --> 03:57:25,502
but your back cracks into the part of stone that
raises up over the platform. You, unfortunately,

4528
03:57:25,502 --> 03:57:30,463
you reduce the damage somewhat, but you still end
up taking 14 points of damage from the impact.

4529
03:57:30,463 --> 03:57:31,452
TALIESIN: Okay.

4530
03:57:31,452 --> 03:57:36,085
MATT: And you are prone. That was K'Varn's
movement. Now, K'Varn is going to go ahead and

4531
03:57:36,085 --> 03:57:46,405
fire three additional rays. All right. The kind of
pinkish-red ray streaks across and is going to

4532
03:57:46,405 --> 03:57:50,450
slam into you. Go ahead and make your saving
throw.

4533
03:57:50,450 --> 03:57:52,005
ASHLEY: She's all the way up there.

4534
03:57:52,005 --> 03:57:55,062
MATT: It's going to be a wisdom saving throw with
advantage.

4535
03:57:55,062 --> 03:57:59,829
LAURA: 21.

4536
03:57:59,829 --> 03:58:04,759
MATT: 21. The beam comes across, hits you in the
shoulder, kind of goes across the front of your

4537
03:58:04,759 --> 03:58:11,225
chest. For a moment, you feel this kind of
bloodthirsty urge fill you and you just wince and

4538
03:58:11,225 --> 03:58:12,471
feel it wash over your body.

4539
03:58:12,471 --> 03:58:13,919
TRAVIS: Oh, thank god.

4540
03:58:13,919 --> 03:58:28,045
MATT: All right. The second ray. Reroll that.
All right. The second one is going to go ahead and

4541
03:58:28,124 --> 03:58:36,955
streak down towards Grog. Grog, I need you to go
ahead and make a dexterity check. With, I'll say

4542
03:58:36,955 --> 03:58:38,966
disadvantage 'cause you're on the ground.

4543
03:58:38,966 --> 03:58:41,533
TALIESIN: But the advantage cancels-- advantage?

4544
03:58:41,533 --> 03:58:43,495
MATT: Sure, so it'd be just a regular roll.

4545
03:58:43,495 --> 03:58:44,571
TRAVIS: Five?

4546
03:58:44,571 --> 03:58:45,648
MATT: Five? All right.

4547
03:58:45,648 --> 03:58:46,805
TALIESIN: Regular roll?

4548
03:58:46,805 --> 03:58:51,333
MATT: That was his first roll. Regular roll, yeah.
All right.

4549
03:58:51,333 --> 03:58:52,949
SAM: That's a strong five.

4550
03:58:52,949 --> 03:58:59,804
TRAVIS: That's a pissed-off goliath five. (laughs)
I am Kerri Strug.

4551
03:58:59,804 --> 03:59:05,292
MATT: All right. Grog, you take 61 points of
damage.

4552
03:59:05,292 --> 03:59:08,129
ASHLEY: 61 points of damage?

4553
03:59:08,129 --> 03:59:16,733
MATT: As the black ray that is carrying that heavy
aura of shadow, just beams into the ground,

4554
03:59:16,733 --> 03:59:18,540
slamming into your torso.

4555
03:59:18,540 --> 03:59:19,872
LAURA: What are you at?

4556
03:59:19,872 --> 03:59:21,032
TRAVIS: 13.

4557
03:59:21,032 --> 03:59:25,993
ASHLEY: Oh no!

4558
03:59:25,993 --> 03:59:28,561
TRAVIS: Thanks for the Death Ward. (laughs)

4559
03:59:29,201 --> 03:59:38,966
MATT: Second ray into Grog. He touched the horn
and really pissed it off. All right. Go ahead and

4560
03:59:38,966 --> 03:59:41,079
make a constitution saving throw, Grog.

4561
03:59:41,079 --> 03:59:44,609
ASHLEY: Come on, buddy.

4562
03:59:44,609 --> 03:59:45,728
TRAVIS: 13.

4563
03:59:45,728 --> 03:59:52,343
MATT: 13? A secondary beam, this one like a deep
reddish-brown color, slams into your torso. You

4564
03:59:52,343 --> 03:59:55,117
take 36 points of necrotic damage.

4565
03:59:55,117 --> 03:59:56,821
SAM: Death Ward.

4566
03:59:56,821 --> 03:59:59,090
TRAVIS: Death Ward is activated?

4567
03:59:59,090 --> 04:00:06,910
MATT: All right, so as the beam is about to blast
your body into severe shock, you feel that surge

4568
04:00:06,910 --> 04:00:12,780
of Sarenrae's energy guide over you and pull back
with one hit point left. K'Varn, frustrated, looks

4569
04:00:12,875 --> 04:00:16,700
down at you with your eyes still open and goes,
"No!"

4570
04:00:16,700 --> 04:00:19,576
ASHLEY: Yes!

4571
04:00:19,576 --> 04:00:25,155
TRAVIS: Fucking done.

4572
04:00:25,155 --> 04:00:27,086
MATT: 22, all right.

4573
04:00:27,086 --> 04:00:30,386
MARISHA: Can someone handle the fucking meatball?

4574
04:00:30,386 --> 04:00:31,534
TRAVIS: One, one.

4575
04:00:31,534 --> 04:00:36,056
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength saving throw,
Grog.

4576
04:00:36,056 --> 04:00:38,931
LAURA: Ugh. Again? He's getting it again?

4577
04:00:38,931 --> 04:00:40,351
ASHLEY AND TRAVIS: Natural 20!

4578
04:00:40,351 --> 04:00:43,789
(cheering)

4579
04:00:43,789 --> 04:00:47,318
MATT: The ray slams into your body. You can see
the telekinesis beam trying to move you. But for

4580
04:00:47,318 --> 04:00:49,508
the moment you're just too heavy.

4581
04:00:49,508 --> 04:00:51,328
(laughter)

4582
04:00:51,328 --> 04:00:56,620
MATT: That's going to end K'Varn's turn. That
brings us to Clarota. Clarota's going to go ahead

4583
04:00:56,620 --> 04:01:02,992
and pull back further, here. Actually, no.
Clarota's going to-- Hold on, let's see if he gets

4584
04:01:02,992 --> 04:01:06,765
his Mind Blast back. Nope. He's going to go ahead
and attempt another Lightning Bolt.

4585
04:01:06,765 --> 04:01:12,644
ASHLEY: I'm so stressed out.

4586
04:01:17,337 --> 04:01:20,020
LIAM: I've never looked so intensely at a little
plastic toy.

4587
04:01:20,258 --> 04:01:24,406
LAURA: (laughs) I know.

4588
04:01:24,406 --> 04:01:26,348
TALIESIN: Fuck you, little plastic toy. You're not
the boss of me.

4589
04:01:26,348 --> 04:01:28,711
TRAVIS: I can't even look at it. I've been looking
down.

4590
04:01:28,711 --> 04:01:31,046
MATT: 14 points of lightning damage against
K'Varn.

4591
04:01:31,046 --> 04:01:33,515
LIAM: Full view of the eyeball, like, "Fuck you".

4592
04:01:33,515 --> 04:01:36,783
MATT: At the end of Clarota's turn, K'Varn's going
to use a legendary action to fire another beam at

4593
04:01:36,783 --> 04:01:38,106
Grog.

4594
04:01:38,106 --> 04:01:39,785
SAM: Oh my god.

4595
04:01:39,785 --> 04:01:41,341
LAURA: He hates you, Grog.

4596
04:01:41,341 --> 04:01:43,042
SAM: Is this an automatic hit?

4597
04:01:43,042 --> 04:01:48,583
MATT: Yeah, all the beams automatically hit. Go
ahead and make another dexterity saving throw.

4598
04:01:48,583 --> 04:01:50,893
SAM: Dexterity. That's your good die.

4599
04:01:50,893 --> 04:01:53,965
TRAVIS: 18.

4600
04:01:53,965 --> 04:02:03,271
MATT: 18. That same, fuzzing black ray comes back
again for a second streak, slamming into you. As

4601
04:02:03,271 --> 04:02:13,665
it hits you, you feel this sucking cold sensation
as the soul is pulled from your body, lifeless on

4602
04:02:13,665 --> 04:02:22,559
the ground. The light left Grog's eyes, laying
slain on the floor of the temple. As that necrotic

4603
04:02:22,559 --> 04:02:28,194
energy kind of drifts off of Grog, it pulls into
the horn, and K'Varn, you notice, the wounds begin

4604
04:02:28,194 --> 04:02:41,730
to seal up a little bit, and a chuckle comes out.
"Who's next?" Percy, you're up.

4605
04:02:41,730 --> 04:02:49,846
TALIESIN: Okay, weird question. (laughs) All
right, we've got a giant spiral machine hanging by

4606
04:02:49,846 --> 04:02:51,790
two chains right now.

4607
04:02:51,790 --> 04:02:52,861
MATT: Yes.

4608
04:02:52,861 --> 04:02:55,877
TALIESIN: I'm going to peek over the edge. And is
there a way that if I happen to snap one of those

4609
04:02:55,877 --> 04:03:00,645
chains that that thing would go slamming into
him?

4610
04:03:00,645 --> 04:03:03,132
MATT: Very possible.

4611
04:03:03,132 --> 04:03:06,445
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull over and make that
shot. I'm going to steady myself, sit down, and

4612
04:03:06,445 --> 04:03:07,866
I'm going to make that shot.

4613
04:03:07,866 --> 04:03:11,295
MATT: Okay. Bad News aimed up. You're aiming--
You're probably going to have to move around to

4614
04:03:11,295 --> 04:03:12,383
this side.

4615
04:03:12,383 --> 04:03:13,662
TALIESIN: Fine.

4616
04:03:13,662 --> 04:03:16,188
MATT: Which is very careful, around the two of
them-- Oh, actually,

4617
04:03:16,188 --> 04:03:17,460
you'd probably go around this side.

4618
04:03:17,460 --> 04:03:18,429
TALIESIN: I go around the other way.

4619
04:03:18,429 --> 04:03:20,548
MATT: Yeah, so you make your way to here. You
kneel down with the Bad News. You aim for one of

4620
04:03:20,548 --> 04:03:28,516
the weak points of the metal, bent and ruined from
the swinging of the platform. You grabbed that

4621
04:03:28,516 --> 04:03:30,788
horn, Grog.

4622
04:03:30,788 --> 04:03:32,565
TALIESIN: 17.

4623
04:03:32,565 --> 04:03:35,676
MATT: 17? Does not hit.

4624
04:03:35,676 --> 04:03:37,366
TALIESIN: Does not hit a not-moving target?

4625
04:03:37,366 --> 04:03:39,570
MATT: Oh, no no. I was thinking of his AC. That
hits the platform, I'm so dumb.

4626
04:03:39,570 --> 04:03:40,502
TALIESIN: So-- Thank you.

4627
04:03:40,502 --> 04:03:44,073
MATT: Yes, that does hit. Go ahead and roll
damage.

4628
04:03:44,073 --> 04:03:47,786
TALIESIN: Seven, eight, nine, ten. 15 points of
damage.

4629
04:03:47,786 --> 04:03:53,614
MATT: 15 points of damage? Go ahead and make a
constitution save as the blast of the Bad News

4630
04:03:53,614 --> 04:03:55,452
threatens to push you back.

4631
04:03:55,452 --> 04:03:56,764
TALIESIN: 20.

4632
04:03:56,764 --> 04:04:01,563
MATT: Keeping your low stance, you keep yourself,
with strain, on the top. The blast hits the side

4633
04:04:01,563 --> 04:04:08,243
of the metal. The metal streaks and breaks and
snaps. The single bit of the contraption swings

4634
04:04:08,243 --> 04:04:15,992
widely, slamming into the side of K'Varn. K'Varn
does not make his dexterity saving throw.

4635
04:04:15,992 --> 04:04:17,704
TALIESIN: Yes!

4636
04:04:17,704 --> 04:04:19,519
ORION: Very good.

4637
04:04:19,519 --> 04:04:28,030
MATT: K'Varn takes 36 points of damage. The blast
of the arcane nature of the contraption and the

4638
04:04:28,030 --> 04:04:34,271
impact from-- It slams into him, pushing him all
the way to the side over here. So, leaving you

4639
04:04:34,271 --> 04:04:39,052
right where you were, there. And you can see now,
part of the metal armor has completely been

4640
04:04:39,052 --> 04:04:45,146
destroyed by the impact. So the AC actually lowers
for K'Varn, and he's looking pretty rough.

4641
04:04:45,146 --> 04:04:47,564
TALIESIN: Cool. Bonus action. I'm shooting him
again.

4642
04:04:47,564 --> 04:04:49,321
MATT: Oh, you mean the Action Surge?

4643
04:04:49,321 --> 04:04:50,548
TALIESIN: Action Surge.

4644
04:04:50,548 --> 04:04:52,517
MATT: Okay, 'cause you used your second attack to
reload.

4645
04:04:52,517 --> 04:04:55,107
TALIESIN: Yeah. Well, I used my second attack to
reload. Now I'm on my-- Yeah.

4646
04:04:55,107 --> 04:05:00,523
MATT: You-- Unfortunately, from your position,
since it slammed in this direction, you don't have

4647
04:05:00,523 --> 04:05:04,007
eyesight on him, unless he's considered having
cover right now.

4648
04:05:04,007 --> 04:05:07,584
TALIESIN: Have I actually moved all six of my--
All six of my spaces for movement?

4649
04:05:07,584 --> 04:05:12,007
MATT: To move around the whole platform? Yeah, you
would have had to. You can still fire, but he'll

4650
04:05:12,007 --> 04:05:14,051
have three-quarters cover.

4651
04:05:14,051 --> 04:05:16,015
TALIESIN: I ignore three-quarters cover!

4652
04:05:16,015 --> 04:05:17,656
MATT: Then fucking fire.

4653
04:05:17,656 --> 04:05:24,752
TALIESIN: Thank you. All right. I'm spending the
last of my Grit to do yet another head shot.

4654
04:05:24,752 --> 04:05:26,034
MATT: Okay.

4655
04:05:26,034 --> 04:05:27,566
MARISHA: Come on, Percy.

4656
04:05:27,566 --> 04:05:29,455
LAURA: Isn't he just a giant head?

4657
04:05:29,455 --> 04:05:31,471
TALIESIN: Technically, it's a head shot. It has an
effect.

4658
04:05:31,471 --> 04:05:32,678
LAURA: Okay.

4659
04:05:32,678 --> 04:05:36,872
TALIESIN: I'm shooting him in the eyeball,
basically. That's a 29 to hit.

4660
04:05:36,872 --> 04:05:38,652
MATT: That hits.

4661
04:05:38,652 --> 04:05:44,496
TALIESIN: That's 18 points of damage.

4662
04:05:44,496 --> 04:05:47,189
MATT: 18 points of damage? All right.

4663
04:05:47,189 --> 04:05:50,094
TALIESIN: 18 points of damage, plus the same
thing. Everyone gets this--

4664
04:05:50,094 --> 04:05:51,443
So everyone gets advantage.

4665
04:05:51,443 --> 04:05:55,679
MATT: That's so obnoxious! All right. That's
Percy's turn. Pike, you're up.

4666
04:05:55,679 --> 04:05:58,879
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to-- Can I run over to
Grog?

4667
04:05:58,879 --> 04:06:02,469
MATT: You can try to go ahead and-- You have to
try and break the--

4668
04:06:02,469 --> 04:06:04,786
ASHLEY: The grapple was off.

4669
04:06:04,786 --> 04:06:08,718
MATT: That's right, 'cause the grapple guy got
hit. All right, yeah, so you can go do that. Move

4670
04:06:08,718 --> 04:06:09,781
over to Grog?

4671
04:06:09,781 --> 04:06:12,381
SAM: Come on, Matt, can't you remember where ten
people are at once?

4672
04:06:12,381 --> 04:06:16,008
MATT: 11, technically.

4673
04:06:16,008 --> 04:06:22,016
ASHLEY: I'm going to try this. I'm going to put my
hands on him. Try to cast Revivify.

4674
04:06:22,016 --> 04:06:26,229
MATT: Okay. So as you reach over, you grab your
holy symbol, which, looking down at it, you can

4675
04:06:26,229 --> 04:06:31,025
see that crack is still ominously in the symbol.
But you reach down, you pray

4676
04:06:31,025 --> 04:06:32,424
to Sarenrae to aid you.

4677
04:06:32,424 --> 04:06:33,884
ASHLEY: But he put it in the Mending Wheel!

4678
04:06:33,884 --> 04:06:34,631
MATT: Huh?

4679
04:06:34,631 --> 04:06:35,515
ASHLEY: He put it in the Mending Wheel.

4680
04:06:35,515 --> 04:06:36,501
LAURA: No, remember it didn't work.

4681
04:06:36,501 --> 04:06:38,130
ASHLEY: It didn't work? Okay, never mind.

4682
04:06:38,130 --> 04:06:45,362
MATT: You reach down and touch Grog, and his cold,
still body-- You feel the divine energy begin to

4683
04:06:45,362 --> 04:06:51,875
instill his form. I need you to go ahead and make
a wisdom check.

4684
04:06:51,875 --> 04:06:55,721
ASHLEY: And I have Gnome Cunning, so I get to-- I
get advantage on wisdom checks.

4685
04:06:55,721 --> 04:06:58,993
MATT: Yes you do. From which one? From Gnome's
Cunning?

4686
04:06:58,993 --> 04:07:01,268
ASHLEY: Yeah. So what do I add?

4687
04:07:01,268 --> 04:07:03,234
LAURA: Wisdom, I think.

4688
04:07:03,234 --> 04:07:06,947
MATT: For her racial background, she chooses--
she's a deep gnome.

4689
04:07:06,947 --> 04:07:09,912
SAM: She's such a racist. (laughs)

4690
04:07:09,912 --> 04:07:12,394
ASHLEY: 16.

4691
04:07:12,394 --> 04:07:16,254
MATT: 16? Look that up really fast.

4692
04:07:16,254 --> 04:07:18,407
SAM: It's something.

4693
04:07:18,407 --> 04:07:28,503
MATT: Deep gnome, rock gnome? Okay, Gnome Cunning
is you have advantage on all saving throws against

4694
04:07:28,503 --> 04:07:30,892
magic. This was a check.

4695
04:07:30,892 --> 04:07:32,143
ASHLEY: Okay, so that's not a thing.

4696
04:07:32,143 --> 04:07:34,551
LAURA: Oh, well, it's okay. The high-- The first
one was-- It would still be--

4697
04:07:34,551 --> 04:07:35,784
ASHLEY: The first one was 16.

4698
04:07:35,784 --> 04:07:42,004
MATT: 16? Okay. As you put your hands in, you feel
this surge of warmth, and some of the coldness in

4699
04:07:42,004 --> 04:07:49,490
the air is pulled back in as Grog's chest rises up
with breath, once again. Grog, the darkness fades

4700
04:07:49,490 --> 04:07:53,968
and your eyes come clear. You're looking up, on
your back, into the room. You're at one hit point,

4701
04:07:53,968 --> 04:07:55,031
I'm pretty sure.

4702
04:07:55,031 --> 04:07:55,916
TRAVIS: Okay.

4703
04:07:55,916 --> 04:07:57,274
MATT: For Revivify. But you're alive.

4704
04:07:57,274 --> 04:08:00,613
ASHLEY: He needs-- He's one hit point now, so he
needs a potion. Do you have potions?

4705
04:08:00,613 --> 04:08:02,103
LIAM: Do you have a potion for a bonus action?

4706
04:08:02,103 --> 04:08:04,117
TRAVIS: I do, but it's not my turn. Or can I take
a hit dice at any time?

4707
04:08:04,117 --> 04:08:05,616
ASHLEY: Can I give him a potion?

4708
04:08:05,616 --> 04:08:06,958
LIAM: Shove it in his mouth.

4709
04:08:06,958 --> 04:08:07,988
TRAVIS: I have to wait for my turn.

4710
04:08:07,988 --> 04:08:09,198
MATT: He's right there. I'd say, yeah, you can do
that.

4711
04:08:09,198 --> 04:08:12,159
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to give him a potion. I'm
going to-- I have a big one.

4712
04:08:12,159 --> 04:08:14,440
LAURA: Yeah, we have a superior.

4713
04:08:14,440 --> 04:08:16,139
ASHLEY: Yeah, I have a superior.

4714
04:08:16,139 --> 04:08:18,535
LAURA: And what does a superior do?

4715
04:08:18,535 --> 04:08:19,677
MATT: Superior is--

4716
04:08:19,677 --> 04:08:22,761
LAURA: It's like 100 hit points, I think?

4717
04:08:22,761 --> 04:08:25,083
MATT: Is 8d4 plus eight.

4718
04:08:25,083 --> 04:08:26,043
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

4719
04:08:26,043 --> 04:08:27,877
MATT: That'll do.

4720
04:08:27,877 --> 04:08:33,860
TRAVIS: Why didn't I buy one of those?

4721
04:08:43,300 --> 04:08:55,153
SAM: Now you have 3 hit points. Come on, Grog.
Don't die. Again.

4722
04:08:55,230 --> 04:08:57,323
TRAVIS: (laughs) I'm trying not to.

4723
04:08:57,323 --> 04:08:58,753
MATT: What's the amount? What you got?

4724
04:08:58,753 --> 04:09:01,342
TRAVIS: I thought the horn was like a party hat.
Like you could just yank it off.

4725
04:09:01,342 --> 04:09:02,890
SAM: (high-pitched) Yeah, yeah. It seemed totally
reasonable.

4726
04:09:02,890 --> 04:09:04,266
TALIESIN: We were with you. We were totally with
you.

4727
04:09:04,266 --> 04:09:07,077
TRAVIS: Wasn't he-- It wasn't even his. He's
like-- I thought he was wearing it. The fucker's

4728
04:09:07,077 --> 04:09:07,903
on there.

4729
04:09:07,903 --> 04:09:08,624
ASHLEY: 25.

4730
04:09:08,624 --> 04:09:09,696
MATT: 25. All right.

4731
04:09:09,696 --> 04:09:10,890
TRAVIS: Way better than one.

4732
04:09:10,890 --> 04:09:13,044
ASHLEY: Okay. It's something.

4733
04:09:13,044 --> 04:09:16,972
MATT: Go. All right. At the end of your turn,
Pike, K'Varn is angrily going to use a legendary

4734
04:09:16,972 --> 04:09:22,696
action to go ahead and fire another beam at you,
since you went ahead and healed him up. All right,

4735
04:09:22,696 --> 04:09:25,396
go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.

4736
04:09:25,396 --> 04:09:27,561
TALIESIN AND MATT: With advantage.

4737
04:09:27,561 --> 04:09:32,212
ASHLEY: Okay. 19.

4738
04:09:32,212 --> 04:09:36,639
MATT: 19. You manage to dodge out of the way
before it hits the stone around you, carving just

4739
04:09:36,639 --> 04:09:41,723
past Grog. No effect. However, where it hits the
stone, you can see the stone is carved in this

4740
04:09:41,723 --> 04:09:44,699
giant groove, like the beam itself is like a giant
welding torch.

4741
04:09:44,699 --> 04:09:45,800
ASHLEY: Thank god.

4742
04:09:45,800 --> 04:09:47,650
MATT: That ends your turn. Scanlan.

4743
04:09:47,650 --> 04:09:56,549
SAM: Ah! Hey! Oh, hi guys. Do I blind it or do I
attack it?

4744
04:09:56,549 --> 04:09:59,261
LAURA: Blind it. No, I don't know.

4745
04:09:59,261 --> 04:10:01,080
SAM: Is he looking at me?

4746
04:10:01,080 --> 04:10:02,868
TRAVIS: Where are you?

4747
04:10:02,868 --> 04:10:08,148
MATT: You are down here. He's not currently really
looking at-- Actually, no. He was looking down at

4748
04:10:08,148 --> 04:10:11,233
them. So it's that-- So yeah, you'd be in the
current cone.

4749
04:10:11,233 --> 04:10:13,133
TRAVIS: Or get out of his eyesight. Remember, your
magic--

4750
04:10:13,133 --> 04:10:14,535
SAM: I'm going to blind his big eye.

4751
04:10:14,535 --> 04:10:16,637
LIAM: With what?

4752
04:10:16,637 --> 04:10:17,812
SAM: With Blindness.

4753
04:10:17,812 --> 04:10:19,970
MATT: You would have to move. You're currently in
his eyesight.

4754
04:10:19,970 --> 04:10:21,808
SAM: Oh, he can see me? I'm in his field of
vision?

4755
04:10:21,808 --> 04:10:22,592
MATT: Yeah.

4756
04:10:22,592 --> 04:10:23,641
SAM: Oh, then never mind.

4757
04:10:23,641 --> 04:10:24,536
LAURA: You can move.

4758
04:10:24,536 --> 04:10:25,924
LIAM: Move out of the way.

4759
04:10:25,924 --> 04:10:26,793
TRAVIS: Just move to the right.

4760
04:10:26,793 --> 04:10:27,455
LAURA: Yeah.

4761
04:10:27,455 --> 04:10:29,088
LIAM: Move out of the cone.

4762
04:10:29,088 --> 04:10:30,298
SAM: Okay, I'll move out of the cone.

4763
04:10:30,298 --> 04:10:32,642
LIAM: Past Clarota. Maybe out--

4764
04:10:32,642 --> 04:10:34,431
SAM: And now I try to blind him.

4765
04:10:34,431 --> 04:10:35,560
MATT: All right.

4766
04:10:35,560 --> 04:10:37,808
SAM: Wait, I-- Through the Hand Cone of Clarity,
of course.

4767
04:10:37,808 --> 04:10:42,064
MATT: All right. That is a 20. What is your DC?

4768
04:10:42,064 --> 04:10:44,302
SAM: (sings) Blinded by the light.

4769
04:10:44,302 --> 04:10:48,668
ALL: (sings) Wrapped up like a douche, another
roller in the night.

4770
04:10:48,668 --> 04:10:50,395
MATT: What's the DC of your spell?

4771
04:10:50,395 --> 04:10:51,559
SAM: 19.

4772
04:10:51,559 --> 04:10:52,575
MATT: He rolled a 20.

4773
04:10:52,575 --> 04:10:53,991
SAM: Fuck you.

4774
04:10:53,991 --> 04:10:55,638
MATT: "Yes."

4775
04:10:55,638 --> 04:10:56,722
ASHLEY: Shit.

4776
04:10:56,722 --> 04:10:59,721
MATT: As you release the spell, the eyestalks turn
and you can see the darkness that normally fades

4777
04:10:59,721 --> 04:11:03,254
over the eyes just gloss over and dissipate.

4778
04:11:03,254 --> 04:11:07,481
SAM: Great. Well then, as my bonus action, I'll
give Grog just a little bit more healing.

4779
04:11:07,481 --> 04:11:08,920
TRAVIS: Yeah, thanks.

4780
04:11:08,920 --> 04:11:10,351
SAM: Six more.

4781
04:11:10,351 --> 04:11:11,741
TRAVIS: Take it. Thank you, sir.

4782
04:11:11,741 --> 04:11:23,619
MATT: All right. It's now Kima's turn. Kima's
going to hold off, looks over at Keyleth and says,

4783
04:11:23,619 --> 04:11:26,768
"If you can give me another one of those tosses
like you gave Grog?"

4784
04:11:26,768 --> 04:11:29,534
MARISHA: (grunting affirmatively)

4785
04:11:29,534 --> 04:11:33,569
MATT: Kima holds. Back at the top of the round.

4786
04:11:33,569 --> 04:11:37,389
SAM: She's in human form, by the way. (laughs)
It's just how she talks.

4787
04:11:37,389 --> 04:11:42,473
MARISHA: My turn? Is it my turn? Sure. I'll go
ahead-- Since she's a tiny dwarf, I'll--

4788
04:11:42,473 --> 04:11:46,070
MATT: All right, go ahead make an athletics
check.

4789
04:11:46,070 --> 04:11:52,847
MARISHA: What's that, just a strength check as an
elemental, I guess?

4790
04:11:52,847 --> 04:11:54,808
MATT: Yeah, add five to the d20 roll.

4791
04:11:54,808 --> 04:11:56,687
MARISHA: 23.

4792
04:11:56,687 --> 04:12:04,511
MATT: 23. All right. You send Kima flying in the
air, maul arcing through the sky. As she arcs the

4793
04:12:04,511 --> 04:12:13,184
mark above her, a giant flash of divine energy,
just kind of sparks in-- Is left behind her like a

4794
04:12:13,184 --> 04:12:23,554
giant trail through the sky. She brings the hammer
down towards K'Varn. That is a 21, that hits. As

4795
04:12:23,554 --> 04:12:29,516
she slams into it, Kima-- Go ahead and throw-- Is
going to go ahead and throw a 3rd-level spell into

4796
04:12:29,516 --> 04:12:40,764
Divine Smite, doing an additional 3d8 damage on
top of that. That'll be

4797
04:12:40,764 --> 04:12:42,982
38 points of divine damage.

4798
04:12:42,982 --> 04:12:44,567
SAM: That's great.

4799
04:12:44,567 --> 04:12:47,959
MATT: Slamming into the side, knocking teeth out.
You can see, now, portions of the eye starting to

4800
04:12:47,959 --> 04:12:58,237
swell. K'Varn's looking pretty rough. Kima,
however, just continues to go and attempts to land--

4801
04:12:58,237 --> 04:13:09,584
Does not make the athletics check and takes--
Okay, that'll be 22 points of damage from the

4802
04:13:09,584 --> 04:13:12,134
fall. And is prone.

4803
04:13:12,134 --> 04:13:13,467
SAM: From the fall?

4804
04:13:13,467 --> 04:13:16,812
MATT: But is happy with the damage that she dealt.
Grog.

4805
04:13:16,812 --> 04:13:17,894
TRAVIS: Yes?

4806
04:13:17,894 --> 04:13:19,291
MATT: It's your turn.

4807
04:13:19,291 --> 04:13:20,836
SAM: Run. Away.

4808
04:13:20,836 --> 04:13:24,452
TRAVIS: Am I still prone?

4809
04:13:24,452 --> 04:13:25,995
MATT: You are, yes.

4810
04:13:25,995 --> 04:13:27,128
TRAVIS: Can I stand up?

4811
04:13:27,128 --> 04:13:28,959
MATT: You can. That's your movement to get up.

4812
04:13:28,959 --> 04:13:30,333
TRAVIS: That's my movement to get up?

4813
04:13:30,333 --> 04:13:31,284
MATT: Yeah.

4814
04:13:31,284 --> 04:13:35,123
TRAVIS: God, son of a bitch. He's looking at me,
right?

4815
04:13:35,123 --> 04:13:39,030
MATT: He's kind of looking in that direction. Not
directly down at you.

4816
04:13:39,030 --> 04:13:41,283
TRAVIS: But I'm in the cone of shit?

4817
04:13:41,283 --> 04:13:43,533
MATT: You're just on the cusp of it, yeah.

4818
04:13:43,533 --> 04:13:48,898
TRAVIS: Can I use the Chain of Returning to throw
my axe at him?

4819
04:13:48,898 --> 04:13:50,928
MATT: You can.

4820
04:13:50,928 --> 04:13:54,701
TRAVIS: Yeah, 'cause I can't move anywhere,
right?

4821
04:13:54,701 --> 04:13:56,193
MATT: Technically, no.

4822
04:13:56,193 --> 04:13:57,819
SAM: You can heal yourself.

4823
04:13:57,819 --> 04:14:00,634
TRAVIS: I think-- Can I use it-- Can I heal myself
after I throw it? Can I?

4824
04:14:00,634 --> 04:14:02,811
Or is it one or the other?

4825
04:14:02,811 --> 04:14:10,578
MATT: Put it this way. Since you stood up, you're
now like cusping in the cone-- The anti-magic

4826
04:14:10,578 --> 04:14:16,682
cone. Any potions drank in that area will have no
effect. Magic, the actual potions, are dispelled.

4827
04:14:16,682 --> 04:14:21,944
TRAVIS: I had to stand up. Let's throw an axe.

4828
04:14:21,944 --> 04:14:24,866
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll to attack.

4829
04:14:24,866 --> 04:14:27,072
MARISHA: It's like Ren Faire.

4830
04:14:27,072 --> 04:14:29,283
TRAVIS: A one.

4831
04:14:29,283 --> 04:14:38,878
MATT: As you reach back, you lob the axe. The
Chain of Returning, now also in the cone of

4832
04:14:38,878 --> 04:14:46,282
anti-magic, just snaps off the axe. The axe goes
flying across the room, clattering to the ground

4833
04:14:46,282 --> 04:14:49,581
underneath the corner over here.

4834
04:14:49,581 --> 04:14:52,105
ASHLEY: We're going to die.

4835
04:14:52,105 --> 04:14:54,206
LAURA: He's almost dead, he's almost dead.

4836
04:14:54,206 --> 04:14:56,161
TRAVIS: The Chain of Returning's magic?

4837
04:14:56,161 --> 04:14:58,595
SAM: He's almost dead until he kills.

4838
04:14:58,595 --> 04:15:00,494
MARISHA: Anything that has a name, like Chain of
Something.

4839
04:15:00,494 --> 04:15:02,185
MATT: Tiberius.

4840
04:15:02,185 --> 04:15:04,057
TRAVIS: I was like, just, Chain of Cool. Awesome.

4841
04:15:04,057 --> 04:15:05,366
SAM: Are you still running for Congress out
there?

4842
04:15:05,366 --> 04:15:06,720
MARISHA: Chain of Dope.

4843
04:15:06,720 --> 04:15:09,621
ORION: I'm not-- That's probably not going to
work. I head back up to the top. Actually, no, I

4844
04:15:09,621 --> 04:15:18,016
don't. I go to the side of the temple where the
rope that I was throwing earlier goes and meets

4845
04:15:18,016 --> 04:15:20,207
down to the floor. So I--

4846
04:15:20,207 --> 04:15:24,668
MATT: Okay, so you head down towards the base of
the temple.

4847
04:15:24,668 --> 04:15:29,301
ORION: Yeah. I will-- No, I-- Fuck, no. Hold on a
second, I don't do that. I redact that.

4848
04:15:29,301 --> 04:15:30,714
MATT: Okay.

4849
04:15:30,714 --> 04:15:42,116
ORION: I have the fucking carpet, okay. I go back
to the top. I can get up there, right, like where

4850
04:15:42,116 --> 04:15:43,456
they are?

4851
04:15:43,456 --> 04:15:45,056
LIAM: You should lob a Fireball.

4852
04:15:45,056 --> 04:15:48,188
LAURA: Yeah, just throw a Fireball from the
outside, just throw one.

4853
04:15:48,188 --> 04:15:52,665
ORION: Does he see me?

4854
04:15:52,665 --> 04:15:57,607
MATT: I mean, you're visible up here. You can see
him, he can see you.

4855
04:15:57,607 --> 04:16:00,601
LAURA: But you're not in the cone. He's looking
down.

4856
04:16:00,601 --> 04:16:03,576
ORION: That's what I mean, like is he looking at
me, right now?

4857
04:16:03,576 --> 04:16:05,261
MATT: He's kind of looking in this direction right
now.

4858
04:16:05,261 --> 04:16:06,792
ORION: Okay.

4859
04:16:06,792 --> 04:16:09,020
LAURA: You're going to get the fucking killing
blow, man.

4860
04:16:09,020 --> 04:16:12,572
ORION: I'm going to cast Telekinesis and rip his
horn off his head.

4861
04:16:12,572 --> 04:16:17,362
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make the check for
Telekinesis.

4862
04:16:17,362 --> 04:16:31,561
ORION: Well, that doesn't happen. Oh, actually-- I
used that. Yeah, no. That doesn't hit. So I'll

4863
04:16:31,561 --> 04:16:33,707
have to spend another--

4864
04:16:33,707 --> 04:16:37,204
MATT: Okay, so, as you release the Telekinesis,
you pull and pull, but that horn is definitively

4865
04:16:37,204 --> 04:16:38,705
locked in place.

4866
04:16:38,705 --> 04:16:47,250
ORION: Okay. Then I'll spend five more and I'll
attempt to rip off one of his tentacles.

4867
04:16:47,250 --> 04:16:51,436
MATT: Stalks? Okay. Go ahead, make another check.

4868
04:16:51,436 --> 04:16:55,967
ORION: I'm going to check that last one off. Check
this off. I'm blast-- I'm using all these from my

4869
04:16:55,967 --> 04:16:57,325
Ioun stones!

4870
04:16:57,325 --> 04:16:58,242
MATT: Okay.

4871
04:16:58,242 --> 04:17:11,127
ORION: I, yeah. That hits. What is that? My, 20--
Oh no-- Fuck what I said, it's 29.

4872
04:17:11,127 --> 04:17:12,200
MATT: 29?

4873
04:17:12,200 --> 04:17:13,397
ORION: Yeah.

4874
04:17:13,397 --> 04:17:20,017
MATT: All right. So as you pull, one of the eye
stalks gets flung off the body, and you can see

4875
04:17:20,017 --> 04:17:24,067
this, like, spurt of brackish blood that spills
across the area nearby.

4876
04:17:24,067 --> 04:17:26,213
MARISHA: Oh, I hope it was a Disintegration ray
one.

4877
04:17:26,213 --> 04:17:28,000
MATT: Go ahead and roll 3d6.

4878
04:17:28,000 --> 04:17:29,295
ORION: Oh, it does damage?

4879
04:17:29,295 --> 04:17:31,542
MATT: Yep.

4880
04:17:31,542 --> 04:17:32,715
ORION: Four.

4881
04:17:32,715 --> 04:17:35,825
MATT: Four damage. All right, Tiberius. Ends your
turn.

4882
04:17:35,825 --> 04:17:39,431
ORION: And I hop off the carpet and I leave it
there.

4883
04:17:39,431 --> 04:17:40,700
MATT: Okay.

4884
04:17:40,700 --> 04:17:44,116
ORION: Or, I hand it to-- Who's next to me? Uh,
you.

4885
04:17:44,116 --> 04:17:47,269
LAURA: Just, yeah, just let-- The carpet there.

4886
04:17:47,269 --> 04:17:52,437
MATT: Vex, you're up.

4887
04:17:52,437 --> 04:17:53,960
LAURA: I thought Vax was up before me.

4888
04:17:53,960 --> 04:17:54,775
LIAM: Vax is up?

4889
04:17:54,775 --> 04:17:56,110
MATT: Oh yeah, Vax is first, sorry. Go ahead.

4890
04:17:56,110 --> 04:18:00,665
LIAM: I am? And Keyleth has already done her
fastball special, that couldn't happen again at

4891
04:18:00,665 --> 04:18:01,764
the moment?

4892
04:18:01,764 --> 04:18:02,688
MATT: Correct.

4893
04:18:02,688 --> 04:18:08,081
LIAM: All right, so dagger-dagger-dagger. Okay.
That's 26 to hit for the dagger?

4894
04:18:08,081 --> 04:18:11,220
MATT: (mouths) Thank you for your patience. Boss
battle.

4895
04:18:11,220 --> 04:18:11,868
LIAM: Hmm?

4896
04:18:11,868 --> 04:18:13,218
MATT: I was thanking them for their patience.

4897
04:18:13,218 --> 04:18:14,096
LIAM: Oh, sure sure. 26.

4898
04:18:14,096 --> 04:18:14,951
MATT: 26 hits.

4899
04:18:14,951 --> 04:18:16,210
LIAM: I don't know if I'm in his cone or not.

4900
04:18:16,210 --> 04:18:17,063
MATT: You are not.

4901
04:18:17,063 --> 04:18:18,618
LIAM: If I'm not in his cone then that's a ten of
damage.

4902
04:18:18,618 --> 04:18:19,779
MATT: All right.

4903
04:18:19,779 --> 04:18:27,467
LIAM: The next is-- I'm going to use a Luck point,
because I have one more. And I get 20--

4904
04:18:27,467 --> 04:18:29,075
MATT: That's your last Luck point, by the way.
That was three.

4905
04:18:29,075 --> 04:18:30,115
LIAM: Yes, 25. Okay.

4906
04:18:30,115 --> 04:18:31,164
MATT: All right.

4907
04:18:31,164 --> 04:18:39,033
LIAM: Which is ten of damage, and the last dagger
is a one, so it just flies away.

4908
04:18:39,033 --> 04:18:44,039
MATT: All right. All right, so you chuck the
daggers up, they kind of cascade off, one of them

4909
04:18:44,039 --> 04:18:47,038
manages to slam into the side. You pull them back
to your belt and get ready for the next round.

4910
04:18:47,038 --> 04:18:48,481
Vex, you're up.

4911
04:18:48,481 --> 04:18:59,810
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to shoot an arrow at him.
Hail of Thorns as a level three. That is, doesn't

4912
04:18:59,810 --> 04:19:01,499
hit. That's a 14.

4913
04:19:01,499 --> 04:19:05,973
MATT: 14, unfortunately, no. It hits the side of
the wall. Explodes, sending a series of wooden

4914
04:19:05,973 --> 04:19:08,365
spikes into the stone on the side of the temple.

4915
04:19:08,365 --> 04:19:12,897
LAURA: Okay, cool. I can't do that again, can I?
All right, then I'm just gonna shoot him through

4916
04:19:12,897 --> 04:19:14,276
the flaming bow.

4917
04:19:14,276 --> 04:19:16,640
MATT: You used flaming bow twice already, so you
no longer can use it.

4918
04:19:16,640 --> 04:19:22,976
LAURA: I'm not going to use it. I'm just going to
shoot him. This is fun, guys. 23.

4919
04:19:22,976 --> 04:19:25,198
MATT: 23 hits. Go and roll damage with your
Hunter's Mark.

4920
04:19:25,198 --> 04:19:37,091
LAURA: Okay. 13. And 15. 20 points of damage.

4921
04:19:37,170 --> 04:19:42,063
MATT: 20 points of damage. All right.

4922
04:19:42,063 --> 04:19:43,414
How do you want to do this?

4923
04:19:43,414 --> 04:19:47,770
(cheering)

4924
04:19:47,770 --> 04:19:54,941
LAURA: I wanna-- Oh god. How do I want to do
this?

4925
04:19:54,941 --> 04:19:56,602
TALIESIN: You want to do it crying, I know that
much.

4926
04:19:56,602 --> 04:20:03,574
LAURA: I do, I'm crying. I want to shoot him-- Is
it possible to shoot him right where the horn

4927
04:20:03,574 --> 04:20:06,222
meets his head and knock it off of him?

4928
04:20:06,222 --> 04:20:07,548
MATT: No.

4929
04:20:07,548 --> 04:20:08,674
(laughter)

4930
04:20:08,674 --> 04:20:10,539
LAURA: All right, then I shoot him straight in the
eyeball.

4931
04:20:10,539 --> 04:20:14,971
MATT: All right, so as K'Varn's looking around,
kind of frantic at this point, realizing that this

4932
04:20:14,971 --> 04:20:19,767
whole swarm of individuals are pouring into the
temple. That, looking around, you can sense that

4933
04:20:19,767 --> 04:20:26,141
the-- It's lost control of the Elder Brain. It
starts just getting extremely manic and--

4934
04:20:26,141 --> 04:20:27,765
LAURA: Vox Machina!

4935
04:20:27,765 --> 04:20:29,465
MARISHA: Vox Machina!

4936
04:20:29,465 --> 04:20:36,113
MATT: Another ray of energy, it glances up at you,
just in time for you to release that final arrow.

4937
04:20:36,113 --> 04:20:43,066
It strikes down, going right into the pupil. The
light blue color immediately bursts into an angry

4938
04:20:43,066 --> 04:20:49,343
red as the eye closes over, trying to contain the
impact. The blood begins to pour out of the front

4939
04:20:49,343 --> 04:20:54,826
of the eye, as the arrow, you can see pierce out
the back side and is jutting about six inches out

4940
04:20:54,826 --> 04:21:05,381
the back of the Beholder. And K'Varn slowly sinks
a few feet and just slams onto the ground.

4941
04:21:05,381 --> 04:21:06,696
TRAVIS: Fuck you, meatball!

4942
04:21:06,696 --> 04:21:10,179
(cheering)

4943
04:21:10,179 --> 04:21:11,197
TRAVIS: Vex!

4944
04:21:11,197 --> 04:21:12,470
TALIESIN: That is how it's done.

4945
04:21:12,470 --> 04:21:13,369
MATT: That ends your turn, Vex.

4946
04:21:13,369 --> 04:21:16,340
LAURA: And I hug Trinket so tight.

4947
04:21:16,340 --> 04:21:24,570
MATT: Okay. So on K'Varn's turn, black energy
begins to pull into the horn, and the beholder

4948
04:21:24,570 --> 04:21:31,031
opens the eye again. Now, the light blue color is
just a pale white and you can see the jaw's a

4949
04:21:31,031 --> 04:21:36,693
little slack. But the horn is now glowing this
intense black color. And the beholder gets back up

4950
04:21:36,693 --> 04:21:37,932
from his position.

4951
04:21:37,932 --> 04:21:40,883
LAURA: Ugh. He's zombie beholder now.

4952
04:21:40,883 --> 04:21:49,474
MATT: At which, Kima's on the ground, says, "Shit!
Orcus! God of undeath, of course!" And she's going

4953
04:21:49,474 --> 04:21:51,392
to start getting ready on her end.

4954
04:21:51,392 --> 04:21:52,730
LIAM: Evil god!

4955
04:21:52,730 --> 04:21:54,640
LAURA: Oh my god, is this like another boss?

4956
04:21:54,640 --> 04:21:57,866
MARISHA: The horn was from Orcus. He's not a
demigod.

4957
04:21:57,866 --> 04:22:01,161
LIAM: Just two more hours. We got this.

4958
04:22:01,161 --> 04:22:12,149
MATT: K'Varn's going to take another ray attack
at-- Let's see. So a dexterity save against-- This

4959
04:22:12,149 --> 04:22:22,078
would be Kima on the ground. Kima fails. Kima's
form begins to slowly turn to stone.

4960
04:22:22,078 --> 04:22:24,404
SAM: (gasps) Oh no, Kima's stoned.

4961
04:22:24,404 --> 04:22:25,997
TRAVIS: She turned to stone?

4962
04:22:25,997 --> 04:22:26,962
SAM: Kima's stoned.

4963
04:22:26,962 --> 04:22:27,973
LAURA: Kima's turning to stone.

4964
04:22:27,973 --> 04:22:37,170
MATT: Her body's like--Secondary one is-- I rolled
that one. All right, can I get a wisdom saving

4965
04:22:37,170 --> 04:22:39,496
throw from you, Vax?

4966
04:22:39,496 --> 04:22:41,292
LIAM: Sure. Sure, I'm not worried.

4967
04:22:41,292 --> 04:22:42,862
MATT: With advantage.

4968
04:22:42,862 --> 04:22:45,775
LIAM: Yes. Natural 20.

4969
04:22:45,775 --> 04:22:47,402
ALL: Oh!

4970
04:22:47,402 --> 04:22:52,234
MATT: A wave of fear hits your mind for a second,
watching it rise up, but you've seen many horrible

4971
04:22:52,234 --> 04:22:58,148
things and it's not enough to shake your will and
resolve. Third one. All right. Can I get a

4972
04:22:58,148 --> 04:23:02,809
dexterity saving throw? This will be from you,
Pike.

4973
04:23:02,809 --> 04:23:04,412
ASHLEY: Okay.

4974
04:23:04,412 --> 04:23:08,902
LIAM: Jump.

4975
04:23:08,902 --> 04:23:11,673
LAURA: No, with advantage.

4976
04:23:11,673 --> 04:23:13,872
LIAM: (sings) With advantage!

4977
04:23:13,872 --> 04:23:15,580
ASHLEY: Ten.

4978
04:23:15,580 --> 04:23:16,924
TRAVIS: Plus your dex, right?

4979
04:23:16,924 --> 04:23:18,915
ASHLEY: I don't add anything.

4980
04:23:18,915 --> 04:23:23,768
MATT: As a dull green ray fires out from the
currently undead K'Varn,

4981
04:23:23,768 --> 04:23:25,899
you take 45 points of damage.

4982
04:23:25,899 --> 04:23:28,163
SAM: That's a lot.

4983
04:23:28,163 --> 04:23:31,415
ASHLEY: Sweet. All right, all right.

4984
04:23:31,415 --> 04:23:32,609
LIAM: Still alive, still alive.

4985
04:23:32,609 --> 04:23:33,510
MATT: You're still conscious?

4986
04:23:33,510 --> 04:23:34,513
LAURA: Yep, she is.

4987
04:23:34,513 --> 04:23:36,505
MATT: Good. (laughs)

4988
04:23:36,505 --> 04:23:37,662
ASHLEY: How many? How many did you say?

4989
04:23:37,662 --> 04:23:38,477
MATT, LIAM, AND LAURA: 45.

4990
04:23:38,477 --> 04:23:39,800
ASHLEY: 45. Okay. Just to be clear.

4991
04:23:39,800 --> 04:23:44,102
TRAVIS: Fuck this!

4992
04:23:44,102 --> 04:23:47,764
TALIESIN: No, this is the end of, like, Iron Man 3
right now. I'm kind of, I'm a little irritated.

4993
04:23:47,764 --> 04:23:49,257
ORION: And that was a terrible movie.

4994
04:23:49,257 --> 04:23:50,544
TALIESIN: I loved it.

4995
04:23:50,544 --> 04:24:00,388
MATT: Clarota is going to run forward and attempt
to to use his tentacles on K'Varn. That's an 18.

4996
04:24:00,388 --> 04:24:02,983
That hits.

4997
04:24:02,983 --> 04:24:04,922
TRAVIS: Come on, Clarota, do it for your fellow
squid.

4998
04:24:04,922 --> 04:24:08,253
MATT: That's 15 points of psychic damage and is
now trying to grapple the tentacles around the

4999
04:24:08,253 --> 04:24:12,598
front of K'Varn-- The side of K'Varn's head. That
brings us to Percy.

5000
04:24:12,598 --> 04:24:14,509
TALIESIN: I'm going to hop on the magic carpet.

5001
04:24:14,509 --> 04:24:15,943
MATT: All right.

5002
04:24:15,943 --> 04:24:24,742
TALIESIN: And start heading in, and I'm going to
get-- I'm going to get myself down and I'm taking

5003
04:24:24,742 --> 04:24:26,759
a shot at the horn.

5004
04:24:26,759 --> 04:24:29,778
MATT: At the horn? All right. This is going to be
at disadvantage.

5005
04:24:29,778 --> 04:24:31,216
TALIESIN: Because I'm so close?

5006
04:24:31,216 --> 04:24:35,140
MATT: Because you're-- Because you're on the
carpet flying down, making a specific shot at a

5007
04:24:35,233 --> 04:24:36,651
very, very tiny object.

5008
04:24:36,651 --> 04:24:38,299
TALIESIN: Okay.

5009
04:24:38,299 --> 04:24:42,702
SAM: Oh look, there's a man with a gun on a flying
carpet, coming in.

5010
04:24:42,702 --> 04:24:43,835
TALIESIN: 18.

5011
04:24:43,835 --> 04:24:45,871
MATT: 18 against the horn, unfortunately, will not
hit.

5012
04:24:45,871 --> 04:24:49,253
TALIESIN: It hadn't been for disadvantage--

5013
04:24:49,253 --> 04:24:54,540
MATT: I know. You-- the carpet kind of juts back
for a second. The shot just ricochets off a few

5014
04:24:54,540 --> 04:24:57,615
walls. You can see a bit of stone getting knocked
off the side.

5015
04:24:57,615 --> 04:24:59,802
End of your turn?

5016
04:24:59,802 --> 04:25:01,241
TALIESIN: That's the end of my turn.

5017
04:25:01,241 --> 04:25:03,361
MATT: All right. Pike.

5018
04:25:03,361 --> 04:25:06,107
ASHLEY: Okay, it's Divine Intervention time.

5019
04:25:06,107 --> 04:25:07,038
SAM: Whoa.

5020
04:25:07,038 --> 04:25:08,057
LAURA: Yeah.

5021
04:25:08,057 --> 04:25:08,899
ASHLEY: I think it's time.

5022
04:25:08,899 --> 04:25:10,971
MATT: All right, so you're using your action to
call on Divine Intervention. How do you want to

5023
04:25:10,971 --> 04:25:17,192
call your deity? It doesn't need to be anything
too specific, it'd be just, "To aid me." Whatever

5024
04:25:17,192 --> 04:25:18,641
you feel like.

5025
04:25:18,641 --> 04:25:22,605
ASHLEY: Just, sort of, aid every--

5026
04:25:22,605 --> 04:25:26,158
MATT: You grab your holy symbol. What do you shout
out to Sarenrae?

5027
04:25:26,158 --> 04:25:28,615
ASHLEY: Help us kill this thing.

5028
04:25:28,615 --> 04:25:42,358
MATT: Go ahead and roll 2d10. Go ahead and-- So
roll the first one. The second one?

5029
04:25:42,358 --> 04:25:44,709
LIAM: 74.

5030
04:25:44,783 --> 04:25:52,761
MATT: So, at this depth, Sarenrae's influence is a
little too far away to come into this moment. And

5031
04:25:52,761 --> 04:25:55,883
you feel the intervention isn't quite strong
enough to really make her presence known at this

5032
04:25:55,883 --> 04:25:59,645
point. But you feel a sense of warmth and comfort
knowing that, at least, she's looking over you,

5033
04:25:59,645 --> 04:26:03,843
but thinks, "You don't need my aid at this
moment."

5034
04:26:03,843 --> 04:26:05,166
LAURA: Yes we do!

5035
04:26:05,166 --> 04:26:06,708
MATT: So that's your action.

5036
04:26:06,708 --> 04:26:09,822
ASHLEY: That's my action, okay. So, now all I can
do is move?

5037
04:26:09,822 --> 04:26:10,988
MATT: Move, bonus action.

5038
04:26:10,988 --> 04:26:17,946
ASHLEY: Can I-- Actually, can I Divine Strike,
also?

5039
04:26:17,946 --> 04:26:20,963
MATT: I believe that's-- I think that's an action,
unfortunately

5040
04:26:20,963 --> 04:26:23,634
ASHLEY: I think that's a-- Okay. All right, well,
I'll just--

5041
04:26:23,634 --> 04:26:25,233
LIAM: Potion? Potion potion potion potion.

5042
04:26:25,233 --> 04:26:26,990
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, I'll take a potion.

5043
04:26:26,990 --> 04:26:30,331
MATT: Okay, go for it. Heal yourself on that. That
brings us to Scanlan.

5044
04:26:30,331 --> 04:26:36,516
SAM: Oh! Lightning Bolt on the thing with the bad
guy. Lightning.

5045
04:26:36,516 --> 04:26:37,905
MATT: Okay.

5046
04:26:37,905 --> 04:26:38,850
SAM: Lightning.

5047
04:26:38,850 --> 04:26:40,049
MATT: All right.

5048
04:26:40,049 --> 04:26:41,366
SAM: That's all I know.

5049
04:26:41,366 --> 04:26:42,568
MATT: All right, Lightning.

5050
04:26:42,568 --> 04:26:44,138
SAM: And hell, I'll do it at a higher level.

5051
04:26:44,138 --> 04:26:45,520
MARISHA: Yes.

5052
04:26:45,520 --> 04:26:46,448
MATT: At what level?

5053
04:26:46,448 --> 04:26:47,811
SAM: Level three.

5054
04:26:47,811 --> 04:26:49,206
MATT: It is level three normally.

5055
04:26:49,206 --> 04:26:50,812
SAM: No, it's level two for me.

5056
04:26:50,812 --> 04:26:52,270
MATT: I think Lightning Bolt is level three.

5057
04:26:52,270 --> 04:26:53,648
SAM: No, I'm sorry, level four. Level four.

5058
04:26:53,648 --> 04:26:56,675
MATT: Okay. So that'll be 9d6.

5059
04:26:56,675 --> 04:26:59,805
SAM: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

5060
04:26:59,805 --> 04:27:01,703
MATT: Does make his saving throw.

5061
04:27:01,963 --> 04:27:02,921
SAM: Okay, so it's half this?

5062
04:27:02,921 --> 04:27:04,841
TRAVIS: Yeah, come on, buddy.

5063
04:27:04,841 --> 04:27:06,393
SAM: Ah! Lost one.

5064
04:27:06,393 --> 04:27:08,023
LIAM: That's by your feet.

5065
04:27:08,023 --> 04:27:18,760
SAM: Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12. 18. 19,
20, 21, 22, 23-- 25, so 12.

5066
04:27:18,760 --> 04:27:22,775
MATT: 25, so 13 points of lightning damage. The
side of K'Varn's undead form. You can see part of

5067
04:27:22,775 --> 04:27:26,558
the flesh is now blown off the side, hanging
limply. Part of the teeth on the inside of the

5068
04:27:26,558 --> 04:27:30,963
mouth are now visible. It's still standing, held
together by the power of the horn.

5069
04:27:30,963 --> 04:27:33,584
SAM: I give some healing to Pike, as well.

5070
04:27:33,584 --> 04:27:34,810
MATT: All right.

5071
04:27:34,810 --> 04:27:40,160
SAM: (sings) Hey! Hey baby, hey baby, hey.

5072
04:27:40,160 --> 04:27:43,558
LAURA: (sings) It's late. It's late.

5073
04:27:43,558 --> 04:27:45,512
SAM: (sings) Hey baby, hey baby, hey.

5074
04:27:45,512 --> 04:27:46,984
ASHLEY: What are you--

5075
04:27:46,984 --> 04:27:48,567
SAM: It's not much. Oh, it's eight.

5076
04:27:48,567 --> 04:27:49,861
ASHLEY: Oh, that's great.

5077
04:27:49,861 --> 04:27:55,062
MATT: Kima and Keyleth. Kima is going to stand
up.

5078
04:27:55,062 --> 04:27:56,395
ASHLEY: Nine? Okay, great.

5079
04:27:56,395 --> 04:27:57,542
SAM: I counted wrong.

5080
04:27:57,542 --> 04:27:59,368
MATT: Unfortunately, because she was prone, that
kind of takes her turn.

5081
04:27:59,368 --> 04:28:01,282
MARISHA: What is the situation?

5082
04:28:01,282 --> 04:28:02,936
MATT: Yes?

5083
04:28:02,936 --> 04:28:04,488
MARISHA: I'm sorry. What was that? What was that?

5084
04:28:04,488 --> 04:28:05,909
MATT: What are you doing?

5085
04:28:05,909 --> 04:28:10,181
MARISHA: What was that situation with the-- The
hanging, you know,

5086
04:28:10,181 --> 04:28:12,169
Metropolitan Museum of Art piece?

5087
04:28:12,169 --> 04:28:16,627
MATT: It's currently dangling right here. Right
above you, precariously.

5088
04:28:16,627 --> 04:28:18,438
LAURA: Oh, good to know.

5089
04:28:18,438 --> 04:28:19,559
LIAM: Oh yeah.

5090
04:28:19,559 --> 04:28:28,969
MARISHA: Can I as a rock monster go up to it and
grab it?

5091
04:28:28,969 --> 04:28:31,695
MATT: You can certainly try. It looks very heavy.

5092
04:28:31,695 --> 04:28:33,979
MARISHA: It's very heavy?

5093
04:28:33,979 --> 04:28:36,146
LIAM: Yeah, so beat it in the face.

5094
04:28:36,146 --> 04:28:38,776
MARISHA: I was going to try and bring it down on
top of K'Varn.

5095
04:28:38,776 --> 04:28:41,291
TALIESIN: Kind of in the middle of a bunch of
stuff.

5096
04:28:41,291 --> 04:28:44,011
MATT: Yeah. The process of doing that will
probably take out a few other people.

5097
04:28:44,011 --> 04:28:46,407
LIAM: Punch the eyeball.

5098
04:28:46,407 --> 04:28:53,157
MARISHA: I'm then just going to run and just do a
double strike. Well, you know what? I'm going to

5099
04:28:53,157 --> 04:28:55,832
run in and just grapple him. I'm going to grapple
him again.

5100
04:28:55,832 --> 04:28:59,086
MATT: All right, go for it. Go ahead and make an
athletics check.

5101
04:28:59,086 --> 04:29:04,014
MARISHA: Nine.

5102
04:29:04,014 --> 04:29:11,756
MATT: Nine? Yeah, no. You just go to reach and the
Beholder just pushes you off. That ends your turn.

5103
04:29:11,756 --> 04:29:17,326
Kima turns to solid stone locked in place.

5104
04:29:17,326 --> 04:29:19,324
LAURA: Oh, Kima!

5105
04:29:19,324 --> 04:29:21,760
MATT: Grog. You have no axe.

5106
04:29:21,760 --> 04:29:29,915
TRAVIS: No, but I got shit in the Bag of Holding.
'Cause I'm a hoarder. Can I get around behind it

5107
04:29:29,915 --> 04:29:36,443
by going to its left-- Between it and the cage?
Can I fit through there?

5108
04:29:36,443 --> 04:29:37,609
MATT: Here?

5109
04:29:37,609 --> 04:29:39,307
TRAVIS: Yeah. Or just to its side, at least?

5110
04:29:39,307 --> 04:29:40,570
MATT: You can get to its side over here, maybe.

5111
04:29:40,570 --> 04:29:41,474
TRAVIS: I'll take the side.

5112
04:29:41,474 --> 04:29:46,467
MATT: All right. You rush over. As you pass by,
this creature steps forward and is going to

5113
04:29:46,467 --> 04:29:52,293
attempt to grapple you. Through the bars, that's
going to be a 14. Go ahead and roll athletics.

5114
04:29:52,293 --> 04:29:56,641
SAM: Come on, you've been working out.

5115
04:29:56,641 --> 04:29:59,209
TRAVIS: Ten.

5116
04:29:59,209 --> 04:30:04,067
MATT: You take seven points of crushing damage,
and are currently grappled.

5117
04:30:04,067 --> 04:30:11,139
TRAVIS: Crushing damage does-- nope. How many was
it? 14?

5118
04:30:11,214 --> 04:30:12,806
MATT: No, you take seven.

5119
04:30:12,806 --> 04:30:13,849
TRAVIS: Seven.

5120
04:30:13,849 --> 04:30:17,205
MATT: You're grappled. You're still next to
K'Varn, you just can't move any further.

5121
04:30:17,205 --> 04:30:19,103
LAURA: So you could still attack him?

5122
04:30:19,103 --> 04:30:20,062
MATT: If you want to.

5123
04:30:20,062 --> 04:30:20,835
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

5124
04:30:20,835 --> 04:30:21,486
MATT: Yeah.

5125
04:30:21,486 --> 04:30:24,886
TRAVIS: Okay, I'd like to take the Greatsword of
Frenzy out of the Bag of Holding.

5126
04:30:24,886 --> 04:30:29,638
MATT: Okay. You can do that with your bonus
action.

5127
04:30:29,638 --> 04:30:34,407
TRAVIS: Shit, I wanted the bonus action to drink a
potion, but fuck it, I'd like to swing at the

5128
04:30:34,407 --> 04:30:35,758
giant little shit.

5129
04:30:35,758 --> 04:30:38,179
MATT: All right. Go for it.

5130
04:30:38,179 --> 04:30:40,511
TRAVIS: 17.

5131
04:30:40,511 --> 04:30:42,605
MATT: 17 does not hit.

5132
04:30:42,605 --> 04:30:47,309
TRAVIS: Oh, 26.

5133
04:30:47,309 --> 04:30:52,142
MATT: That does hit. Then roll 2d6 for the damage,
plus your strength modifier.

5134
04:30:52,142 --> 04:30:53,928
SAM: Hey, that's good.

5135
04:30:53,928 --> 04:30:57,229
TRAVIS: 11, 15.

5136
04:30:57,229 --> 04:31:01,337
MATT: 15 damage, all right. You slice through part
of its body. You can see, now, three stalks slide

5137
04:31:01,337 --> 04:31:05,155
off, and you can see some of the brain tissue
underneath, but yet its still-necrotic form is

5138
04:31:05,155 --> 04:31:07,123
holding it in place.

5139
04:31:07,146 --> 04:31:08,301
MARISHA: Oh.

5140
04:31:08,301 --> 04:31:10,895
MATT: That ends your turn. Who's next? Tiberius.

5141
04:31:10,895 --> 04:31:12,984
ORION: How many stalks does it have left?

5142
04:31:12,984 --> 04:31:16,770
MATT: It has probably nine.

5143
04:31:16,770 --> 04:31:18,314
ORION: Left?

5144
04:31:18,314 --> 04:31:25,713
MATT: Yeah. Covered in stalks, dude. Looking
really rough, though.

5145
04:31:25,713 --> 04:31:28,634
ORION: Okay.

5146
04:31:28,634 --> 04:31:35,037
LAURA: My magic attacks have been using-- Working
from above, Tiberius.

5147
04:31:35,037 --> 04:31:38,602
ORION: Where is it, actually?

5148
04:31:38,602 --> 04:31:39,728
MATT: He's right here.

5149
04:31:39,728 --> 04:31:41,060
ORION: From where-- Oh.

5150
04:31:41,060 --> 04:31:42,848
LAURA: Shoot him.

5151
04:31:42,848 --> 04:31:44,225
LIAM: Zip, zap, zop.

5152
04:31:44,225 --> 04:31:45,371
LAURA: Get 'im.

5153
04:31:45,371 --> 04:31:50,460
ORION: Okay, I'll do a-- I'll shoot a Glacial
Blast at him.

5154
04:31:50,460 --> 04:31:51,944
MATT: All right.

5155
04:31:51,944 --> 04:31:56,969
ORION: Just a concentrated-- I'll spike it right
before it hits him and jam it in his fucking eye.

5156
04:31:56,969 --> 04:31:59,387
MATT: All right. That's a dexterity save, right?

5157
04:31:59,619 --> 04:32:00,396
ORION: Yes.

5158
04:32:00,396 --> 04:32:04,067
MATT: Okay. That's 19. Makes the dexterity save.
Go ahead and roll damage, takes half damage.

5159
04:32:04,067 --> 04:32:09,536
ORION: 6d8. Oh shit, I need d8 for this. Do you
have d8s?

5160
04:32:09,536 --> 04:32:10,748
TALIESIN: Here, d8s.

5161
04:32:10,748 --> 04:32:14,854
MARISHA: I do, Mr. Pack Away Your Dice.

5162
04:32:14,854 --> 04:32:30,181
ORION: I got it. That is 40.

5163
04:32:30,181 --> 04:32:33,408
MATT: 40. So half that is 20 damage?

5164
04:32:33,491 --> 04:32:34,742
How do you want to do this?

5165
04:32:34,742 --> 04:32:36,260
(cheering)

5166
04:32:36,260 --> 04:32:37,668
LAURA: What? What just happened?

5167
04:32:37,668 --> 04:32:40,139
SAM: We're killing him again. But then--

5168
04:32:40,139 --> 04:32:41,096
ORION: What, really?

5169
04:32:41,096 --> 04:32:42,132
LIAM: Three more forms to go.

5170
04:32:42,132 --> 04:32:42,945
ASHLEY: Get it.

5171
04:32:42,945 --> 04:32:44,076
SAM: Two of ten times.

5172
04:32:44,076 --> 04:32:45,316
ORION: Two of ten times. Okay.

5173
04:32:45,316 --> 04:32:46,648
MATT: What are you going to do with your Glacial
Blast?

5174
04:32:46,648 --> 04:32:53,523
ORION: I'll just-- I mean, like I said. Right
before I do it, I'll shape it into an ice spike

5175
04:32:53,523 --> 04:32:55,230
and right through the eye.

5176
04:32:55,230 --> 04:32:59,651
MATT: Okay. So, you take your arcane form, and you
can see, where the impact of the arrow left behind

5177
04:32:59,651 --> 04:33:03,871
from Vex is already still there and the eye's kind
of slightly concave as the wound's open. You take

5178
04:33:03,871 --> 04:33:08,623
the Glacial Blast into one giant jagged piece of
ice and you thrust it forward with all your arcane

5179
04:33:08,623 --> 04:33:14,555
might. It hits and sinks into the eye and as it
streaks to the inside, it bursts from the

5180
04:33:14,555 --> 04:33:22,844
interior. You see ice shards piercing it from the
inside out. As the form kind of lands on the

5181
04:33:22,844 --> 04:33:30,774
ground there, as ice begins to slowly form and
crackle around its outside, you can still see dark

5182
04:33:30,774 --> 04:33:33,205
energy pulling into the horn.

5183
04:33:33,205 --> 04:33:38,777
ORION: Wonderful, while I-- No! I spend five
Sorcerer points and I do Telekinesis and rip the

5184
04:33:38,777 --> 04:33:40,477
horn off his fucking--

5185
04:33:40,477 --> 04:33:41,511
MATT: How many Sorcery points do you have?

5186
04:33:41,511 --> 04:33:42,679
ORION: That's it after that.

5187
04:33:42,679 --> 04:33:44,421
MARISHA: Why not-- I can just rip it off. I'm a
rock dude.

5188
04:33:44,421 --> 04:33:46,283
ORION: It's my turn.

5189
04:33:46,283 --> 04:33:48,800
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make your roll.

5190
04:33:48,800 --> 04:33:57,269
ORION: What is that? Oh, that's 26.

5191
04:33:57,296 --> 04:34:04,873
MATT: 26. With a sickening tearing sound, you
notice the shaking of the horn begin to slowly

5192
04:34:04,873 --> 04:34:11,779
pull from the slightly dilapidated and decomposing
form of K'Varn. As the horn begins to tug and

5193
04:34:11,779 --> 04:34:17,790
tear, the flesh stretches before, eventually, it's
torn from the body. The moment the horn rises up,

5194
04:34:17,790 --> 04:34:23,667
all that black energy dissipates, the horn held
aloft in mid-air. The rest of K'Varn's form slumps

5195
04:34:23,667 --> 04:34:26,165
to the ground and slowly begins to melt away.

5196
04:34:26,165 --> 04:34:27,249
LAURA: Ew.

5197
04:34:27,249 --> 04:34:29,773
ORION: I'll hold it in place for now and kind
of--

5198
04:34:29,773 --> 04:34:33,664
LAURA: What is that?

5199
04:34:33,664 --> 04:34:34,806
MATT: Just slam over its head?

5200
04:34:34,806 --> 04:34:35,444
ORION: Yeah.

5201
04:34:35,444 --> 04:34:37,023
MATT: Okay.

5202
04:34:37,131 --> 04:34:38,114
SAM: Don't touch it to him.

5203
04:34:38,114 --> 04:34:39,270
TRAVIS: No he's-- Telekinesis, is he's--

5204
04:34:39,270 --> 04:34:40,607
SAM: I know. But don't touch it to the thing.

5205
04:34:40,607 --> 04:34:42,070
TRAVIS: Oh. Oh, right. Yes.

5206
04:34:42,070 --> 04:34:44,301
TALIESIN: It's like the thing at the end of Time
Bandits. We should just--

5207
04:34:44,301 --> 04:34:46,235
ORION: Yeah, I just killed it. Don't tell me what
to do, dawg.

5208
04:34:46,235 --> 04:34:49,148
TRAVIS: (laughs) Don't tell me what to do.

5209
04:34:49,148 --> 04:34:53,669
LAURA: I know, you're so ornery. We fucking
brought you back in here. We told you to hit it.

5210
04:34:53,669 --> 04:34:55,045
ORION: Wait 'til we're not fighting.

5211
04:34:55,045 --> 04:34:56,319
LAURA: Crazy.

5212
04:34:56,319 --> 04:34:59,732
MATT: So as K'Varn's horn is now currently held
aloft via your Telekinesis--

5213
04:34:59,732 --> 04:35:03,493
ORION: I hold it here. I don't want to--

5214
04:35:03,493 --> 04:35:09,154
MATT: That ends your turn. It looks like,
currently, the battle, for the moment--

5215
04:35:09,154 --> 04:35:10,768
SAM: For the moment?

5216
04:35:10,768 --> 04:35:14,558
MATT: Is held as you guys sit here in the center
of the temple.

5217
04:35:14,558 --> 04:35:16,893
LAURA: We got a bunch of illithid coming in here
soon.

5218
04:35:16,893 --> 04:35:18,204
MARISHA: Yes, we do.

5219
04:35:18,204 --> 04:35:24,671
MATT: Look about you. The contraption destroyed.
The loose, pale, pulsing glow of the Elder Brain

5220
04:35:24,671 --> 04:35:29,241
slowly glowing brighter and brighter.

5221
04:35:29,241 --> 04:35:31,748
ORION: Oh. As I see that, I'm going to float this
more towards me.

5222
04:35:31,748 --> 04:35:33,745
MATT: Okay.

5223
04:35:33,745 --> 04:35:38,991
ORION: And I take it-- Now, it's hovering above.
I'm going to hold it about 25 feet away from me in

5224
04:35:38,991 --> 04:35:40,144
the air.

5225
04:35:40,144 --> 04:35:41,225
MATT: All right.

5226
04:35:41,225 --> 04:35:46,387
MATT: And from that point, we'll conclude this
evening's epic boss encounter.

5227
04:35:46,387 --> 04:35:47,768
LAURA: Fuck.

5228
04:35:47,768 --> 04:35:48,279
SAM: Wow.

5229
04:35:48,279 --> 04:35:49,102
TALIESIN: Oh god.

5230
04:35:49,102 --> 04:35:50,029
LAURA: Oh my god.

5231
04:35:50,029 --> 04:35:51,166
MATT: Holy shit, guys.

5232
04:35:51,166 --> 04:35:53,985
LAURA: We didn't die!

5233
04:35:53,985 --> 04:35:55,813
TRAVIS: Well, speak for yourself.

5234
04:35:55,813 --> 04:36:00,390
MATT: You did have a death. But you had a spell to
bring him back.

5235
04:36:00,390 --> 04:36:03,037
TRAVIS: Death Ward for the win.

5236
04:36:03,037 --> 04:36:04,369
ORION: Irresponsible--

5237
04:36:04,369 --> 04:36:10,230
MARISHA: Oh, please. Pooper face. You were so
poopy the entire end of that game.

5238
04:36:10,230 --> 04:36:12,425
ORION: You have no idea. You have no idea what you
guys are in for after this.

5239
04:36:12,425 --> 04:36:14,001
MARISHA: Why? What are you-- What are we in for?

5240
04:36:14,001 --> 04:36:15,052
ORION: I'm not going to--

5241
04:36:15,052 --> 04:36:16,609
LAURA: He knows everything.

5242
04:36:16,609 --> 04:36:17,735
ORION: That's not-- That's the next episode.

5243
04:36:17,735 --> 04:36:19,334
MARISHA: I'm with Vex.

5244
04:36:19,334 --> 04:36:26,736
MATT: That was a marathon session. Thank you all for your patience. Thanks for
staying.

5245
04:36:26,822 --> 04:36:28,093
ASHLEY: Thank you guys for sticking out.

5246
04:36:28,093 --> 04:36:29,051
TRAVIS: Yeah, that was a long one.

5247
04:36:29,051 --> 04:36:31,061
LIAM: How many of you are going to have a hard day
at work in the morning?

5248
04:36:31,061 --> 04:36:33,404
ZAC: Guys, I'm just totalling up all the donations
that we had.

5249
04:36:33,404 --> 04:36:34,675
MATT: Fantastic.

5250
04:36:34,675 --> 04:36:35,445
TALIESIN: Yay!

5251
04:36:35,445 --> 04:36:36,365
ORION: Sweet!

5252
04:36:36,365 --> 04:36:39,299
TRAVIS: Good job, Matt. Good. Job.

5253
04:36:39,299 --> 04:36:41,636
LAURA: He was evil.

5254
04:36:41,636 --> 04:36:45,092
MATT: You guys-- Between your head shots--

5255
04:36:45,092 --> 04:36:47,319
MARISHA: Yeah, your head shots fucking MVP, man.

5256
04:36:47,319 --> 04:36:48,617
MATT: -- were MVP on that battle.

5257
04:36:48,617 --> 04:36:50,595
TALIESIN: Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

5258
04:36:50,595 --> 04:36:55,398
MATT: The setup of both slamming it with the
device and getting the device out of the way, the

5259
04:36:55,398 --> 04:36:59,070
surprise entry of this. Because you guys weren't
all ground level, that kept him floating, which

5260
04:36:59,070 --> 04:37:02,515
meant he couldn't keep using the cone of-- there
was a lot of good things you guys used tactically

5261
04:37:02,515 --> 04:37:03,490
for this battle.

5262
04:37:03,490 --> 04:37:04,849
ASHLEY: Vex had a lot of hit points, too.

5263
04:37:04,849 --> 04:37:07,255
LAURA: Oh, Pike, thanks.

5264
04:37:07,255 --> 04:37:08,226
ASHLEY: You did.

5265
04:37:08,226 --> 04:37:11,012
TRAVIS: First kill.

5266
04:37:11,012 --> 04:37:12,424
LAURA: I know, it was my first--

5267
04:37:12,424 --> 04:37:14,342
SAM: Is that true?

5268
04:37:14,342 --> 04:37:17,638
TRAVIS: It, well, here. Since we've started here.

5269
04:37:17,638 --> 04:37:22,196
MATT: That's right, that was your first on the
stream, yeah.

5270
04:37:22,196 --> 04:37:23,092
LAURA: Yeah.

5271

whatever's in that cage.

5278
04:37:39,009 --> 04:37:40,480

here, now.

5281

since we never even looked?

5282
04:37:47,253 --> 04:37:49,491
MARISHA: Would you stop that?

5283

LAURA: Wait, I have a question-- Is the game going
to continue next week,

5285
04:37:55,994 --> 04:37:57,222
or are you guys taking a week--

5286
04:37:57,222 --> 04:37:59,406
MATT: I'm thinking what we're going to do, guys,
for next week, those who are watching, too,

5287
04:37:59,406 --> 04:38:05,045
because we have a few members that are going to be
gone next week on vacation, we're going to-- I'm

5288
04:38:05,045 --> 04:38:09,151
just basically going to be doing a brief
discussion, I'd say a few hours, talking with you

5289
04:38:09,151 --> 04:38:14,049
guys about how to learn the game, how to DM and
build a game, and to answer your questions about

5290
04:38:14,049 --> 04:38:19,744
the system at all, and just do, generally, a
Dungeons & Dragons-specific kind of workshop for

5291
04:38:19,744 --> 04:38:25,818
you guys. And then, the week after that, we'll
pick up where this left off. Oh, I'm exhausted.

5292
04:38:25,818 --> 04:38:28,459
