1
00:00:00,124 --> 00:00:04,845
MATT: Welcome everyone, to tonight's episode of
Critical Role, a special Halloween edition. My

2
00:00:04,845 --> 00:00:08,874
name is Matthew Mercer. I am the dungeon master
for this show. This wonderful show, where a bunch

3
00:00:08,874 --> 00:00:15,231
of us crazy voice actors get together and roll
dice as a bunch of nerdy DND players. So. Welcome.

4
00:00:15,231 --> 00:00:19,421
For all the newcomers, I am not normally dressed
this insane. We'll be revealing the rest of our

5
00:00:19,421 --> 00:00:24,197
cast here in just a moment. But yeah, before we
get to that, I wanted to get through some quick

6
00:00:24,197 --> 00:00:28,501
announcements overall. Let's see. First and
foremost, for those who missed the announcement

7
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:36,402
yesterday: unfortunately, Orion Acaba is no longer
with Critical Role going forward. He has his own

8
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:41,532
Twitch channel; he's pushing forward on all of
that. Please go and show him support. We wish him

9
00:00:41,532 --> 00:00:46,683
the best; much love to him. Just to clarify, too:
there's been a lot of speculation stuff like that

10
00:00:46,683 --> 00:00:51,809
this was a corporate thing, and people putting all
the blame on Geek and Sundry. This was a joint

11
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:57,735
decision between Critical Role and Geek and
Sundry-- all parties agreed. Please try and be

12
00:00:57,735 --> 00:01:00,277
respectful to everyone involved. Appreciate that.

13
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:06,924
Other things going forward. We have our "How Do
You Want To Do This?" shirt up on the website. We

14
00:01:06,924 --> 00:01:10,804
put that up last week and announced that, for
those who are interested in getting that.

15
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:15,984
Hopefully, they have restocked, because they were
sold out really fast. Keep an eye on that and grab

16
00:01:15,984 --> 00:01:26,109
one if you're interested. Let's see. Also, today
we had Vax'ildan's song playlist on Spotify go

17
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:32,081
live on the website. So you can go watch or listen
to "Songs to Stab People To," which is a pretty

18
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:37,123
great little rendition there. Also, my interview
went up today on the Geek and Sundry website, so you

19
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:43,238
can go ahead and check out my talk and discussion
and Q and A about the show and people involved and

20
00:01:43,238 --> 00:01:48,029
go read that and see if it tickles your fancy.

21
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,388
[Geralt voice] I feel like I should be doing 
it like this for the rest of the night.

22
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:51,380
TRAVIS: Yes, you should!

23
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,423
MATT: Dungeon mastering down here for the
remainder. It's a good plan. Let's see. Taliesin,

24
00:01:55,423 --> 00:01:56,879
you had an announcement?

25
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:04,720
TALIESIN: I did. Hi, sorry. For those of you on
Twitter, you now know what I was just doing. Yes,

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,386
I'm going to be at Oni Con. I'm flying to Oni Con
in Galveston, Texas

27
00:02:09,386 --> 00:02:12,777
at 6:30 tomorrow morning. Yay.

28
00:02:12,777 --> 00:02:13,670
MARISHA: Yay!

29
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:21,654
TALIESIN: Huzzah. So you can see me at Galveston,
Texas between now and Sunday. I'll be there. I'll

30
00:02:21,654 --> 00:02:24,867
be rolling around. I'll be a little jetlagged.
It'll be great.

31
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:31,468
MATT: All righty, good announcement. I like it,
it's a good announcement. Let's see, next up:

32
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:33,351
Liam, you wanted to mention something?

33
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:39,133
LIAM: Yes, I have two announcements. One, Sam and
I have returned to the podcasting scene and

34
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:45,351
released a new episode of All Work No Play. It's
been an eight-month hiatus, so that's out; you

35
00:02:45,351 --> 00:02:49,276
find that on iTunes and elsewhere, but even bigger
than that, I wanted to announce the show's

36
00:02:49,276 --> 00:03:00,333
partnership with Wyrmwood Gaming. We are now all
using gorgeous custom-made Wyrmwood boxes with

37
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:07,704
character names etched in and all that. They're gorgeous.
And if anyone heads over to wyrmwoodgaming.com and

38
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:15,793
uses the coupon code CritRole, then you will get a
discount on any purchases you make there from here

39
00:03:15,793 --> 00:03:22,011
into perpetuity-- that's not true at all. As long
as we're having a good time with Wyrmwood. So

40
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:25,626
thank you, Wyrmwood, for the boxes, and everybody
please go check them out.

41
00:03:25,626 --> 00:03:27,438
LAURA: What was the code again?

42
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:32,550
LIAM: CritRole. I want to lick mine and make love
to it all night long.

43
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,882
MATT: I recommend waiting until after the stream.

44
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,830
MARISHA: Yeah. Which one did you get, Liam?

45
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,330
LIAM: This is the darkest ebony they have.

46
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,858
LAURA: They have all kinds of wood. It's really
freaking cool.

47
00:03:42,858 --> 00:03:44,612
MARISHA: This is the rosewood?

48
00:03:44,612 --> 00:03:49,553
TRAVIS: I got the unicorn walnut wood.

49
00:03:49,553 --> 00:03:53,411
MATT: Yeah, you did. You're a unicorn.

50
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:55,237
TRAVIS: I'm getting crumbs in my bosom?

51
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:56,935
LAURA: Yeah, you are, actually.

52
00:03:56,935 --> 00:03:58,150
LIAM: It's all good.

53
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,697
TRAVIS: Like cookies in bed.

54
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:03,010
TALIESIN: I do know Sam got Purpleheart. Since
he's not here, we can show it.

55
00:04:03,122 --> 00:04:05,575
TRAVIS: He's here. He's just getting ready.

56
00:04:05,575 --> 00:04:06,964
MARISHA: Purpleheart.

57
00:04:06,964 --> 00:04:09,279
MATT: Looks fantastic.

58
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:10,467
TRAVIS: Chicken heart.

59
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:11,641
MARISHA: Chicken heart.

60
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:18,555
MATT: Oh man. That costume, Travis. I think I
mentioned it before-- I'm pretty sure in one of my

61
00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:23,538
games we've had a time. (laughs)

62
00:04:23,538 --> 00:04:26,285
TRAVIS: Do I get advantage all night?

63
00:04:26,285 --> 00:04:27,579
MATT: No.

64
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:30,516
LAURA: Do we all get to see what we're dressed
as?

65
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,123
MARISHA: Yeah, trade me seats for a second, Liam.

66
00:04:34,123 --> 00:04:36,056
LAURA: Get out of here, Dread.

67
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:37,211
LIAM: I'll take this.

68
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:39,344
MATT: There you go. So ladies?

69
00:04:39,344 --> 00:04:44,377
LAURA: This is Rat Queens.

70
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:46,617
MARISHA: We're Rat Queens. I'm Violet.

71
00:04:46,617 --> 00:04:49,710
LAURA: I'm Hannah. You should check it out. It's
an awesome comic book.

72
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,746
MARISHA: You should.

73
00:04:50,746 --> 00:04:52,369
LIAM: You've got to swear.

74
00:04:52,369 --> 00:04:54,945
LAURA: Huh? Oh, I'm conjuring up a little fuck
you.

75
00:04:54,945 --> 00:05:00,742
MARISHA: And what does Violet say? We're going to
put the kick-ass back in team.

76
00:05:00,742 --> 00:05:02,118
Something like that?

77
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:03,333
LAURA: It's pretty great.

78
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:08,372
MARISHA: Rat Queens. It's great. Yeah!

79
00:05:08,422 --> 00:05:10,568
MATT: Travis, what are you dressed as?

80
00:05:10,568 --> 00:05:16,066
TRAVIS: I'm Helga the angry tavern wench, and I
only love one man: Scanlan.

81
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:21,392
MATT: (laughs) That's fantastic. Other side of the
table, let's see.

82
00:05:21,392 --> 00:05:24,419
MARISHA: Oh, look who just showed up.

83
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,683
MATT: Who are you dressed as, Sam?

84
00:05:26,683 --> 00:05:36,703
SAM: I'm either a porn actor or Burt Reynolds. I
can't smile.

85
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:40,742
(laughter)

86
00:05:40,742 --> 00:05:44,498
SAM: It's Smokey and the Bandit. I can't get him
to stay.

87
00:05:44,498 --> 00:05:46,849
MATT: That's okay, we'll find some duct tape for
you.

88
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:48,566
SAM: My costume is awesome.

89
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:52,450
MATT: Awesome, it is awesome. Yeah, your monkey's
been a little rough.

90
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,102
LAURA: Oh my god, I'm so sweaty.

91
00:05:55,102 --> 00:05:57,489
ZAC: Our mustaches need to take a picture with
each other.

92
00:05:57,489 --> 00:05:59,494
TRAVIS: Oh that is some 'stache love.

93
00:05:59,494 --> 00:06:01,166
MATT: Oh, that's amazing.

94
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,959
TRAVIS: Dirty, dirty 'stache love.

95
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:06,013
MATT: All right, Taliesin.

96
00:06:06,013 --> 00:06:12,225
TALIESIN: I am Quentin Quire, Kid Omega of the
X-Men, for those of you who read way too much

97
00:06:12,225 --> 00:06:17,371
X-Men, so this is my throw-together, because he
has a mohawk and so few people do.

98
00:06:17,371 --> 00:06:19,075
LAURA: But we skipped over my brother.

99
00:06:19,075 --> 00:06:20,882
MATT: Yes, indeed, because he vanished.

100
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:28,497
LIAM: I'm the Dread Pirate Roberts, and I will
most likely kill you in the morning-- or myself,

101
00:06:28,497 --> 00:06:30,382
because this is actually very sharp

102
00:06:30,382 --> 00:06:38,089
TRAVIS: Do you have a comment about my perfect
breasts and the shortage of them? Oh no! Careful,

103
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:39,439
they are expensive.

104
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:46,031
MATT: Put that right there. Be careful, or there's
actually stabbing in real life as opposed to just

105
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,022
the game today. That'll be fun.

106
00:06:48,022 --> 00:06:51,214
LIAM: Liam doesn't know how to use knives or
swords at all.

107
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:53,238
MATT: He'll learn in time.

108
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:58,012
MATT: I'm dressed as Geralt of Rivia from the
Witcher Series. Witcher 3, specifically, for this

109
00:06:58,012 --> 00:07:00,428
set of armor and outfit.

110
00:07:00,428 --> 00:07:03,345
LIAM: How about that costume, ladies and
gentlemen?

111
00:07:03,345 --> 00:07:05,796
MARISHA: He made all of that, by the way.

112
00:07:05,796 --> 00:07:07,654
LIAM: He's a full-size action figure.

113
00:07:07,654 --> 00:07:11,574
SAM: He made that?

114
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:12,903
ALL: Yeah.

115
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:14,536
SAM: What are you talking about?

116
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:20,092
MATT: I have a problem. Well, the problem is being
a huge fan of the Witcher series for a long time.

117
00:07:20,092 --> 00:07:26,198
But yeah, that's our crazy Halloween-ness. We'll
kick back here in just a minute to start the game

118
00:07:26,198 --> 00:07:34,623
and see what the wonders and dangers of Whitestone
bring to Vox Machina. See you in just a second.

119
00:07:34,623 --> 00:07:37,307
LAURA: We're all going to die when we're goofy
looking.

120
00:07:37,307 --> 00:08:44,258
[dramatic music]

121
00:08:44,305 --> 00:08:50,238
MATT: Welcome back. So to get you guys up to speed
with the current situation, in our currently

122
00:08:50,238 --> 00:09:00,833
non-air conditioned studio-- great day for this to
coincide. Vox Machina had an encounter with two

123
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:05,420
individuals known as the Briarwoods, Lord and Lady
Briarwood, who currently control Whitestone, the

124
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:10,366
city that Percival-- Taliesin's character-- once
lived in, his family once essentially ruled,

125
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:16,387
before they were usurped and most of them murdered
by the Briarwoods. So upon meeting them, a

126
00:09:16,387 --> 00:09:22,805
vengeance urge kicked up within Percival. The rest
of the party following him to Whitestone to

127
00:09:22,805 --> 00:09:31,387
attempt to free the city from the clutches of the
very seemingly evil and in some cases undead

128
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:35,738
Briarwoods, as the Lord Briarwood appears to be
vampiric in nature.

129
00:09:35,738 --> 00:09:43,543
After arriving, they had some stealth missions,
they went around and discovered a fair warning on

130
00:09:43,543 --> 00:09:50,913
the Sun Tree, one of the central items of
Whitestone, a relic of Pelor from long ago that

131
00:09:50,913 --> 00:09:58,092
the city was built around, now dead and holding a
series of bodies hung from it, all dressed and

132
00:09:58,092 --> 00:10:03,621
painted to look like the members of Vox Machina.
While they were there, they managed to find and

133
00:10:03,621 --> 00:10:07,892
hole up in an abandoned tavern. Closing the
windows off, and after doing a little bit of

134
00:10:07,892 --> 00:10:15,533
digging, spoke to the head of the Lady's Chamber,
the temple to Erathis to which Percival and most

135
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:19,544
of the team seems to be interested in starting a
rebellion in Whitestone. They planted the seed

136
00:10:19,544 --> 00:10:27,826
there to return to germinate at some point. And
then began to follow a couple of individuals, or

137
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:33,755
at least an individual that was partially
responsible for the really honestly shitty social

138
00:10:33,755 --> 00:10:40,441
atmosphere in Whitestone. Following him back to a
home, it was discovered that Sir Kerrion, one of

139
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:45,531
the individuals responsible for the death of
Percival's family, was still part of the ruling

140
00:10:45,531 --> 00:10:50,987
class here. The party then snuck in through the
bottom of the building, stealthed into a full

141
00:10:50,987 --> 00:10:59,270
surprise ambush upon him and his compatriots.
Murdered most of them. They took his toady,

142
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:05,750
essentially, Vouk, and instead of murdering him,
tore out his tongue and then burned the de Rolo

143
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,643
family crest into his forehead--

144
00:11:07,643 --> 00:11:11,956
LIAM: You say they. Not quite how I remember it.

145
00:11:11,956 --> 00:11:14,414
TALIESIN: The way you're putting that is a lot
worse than actually--

146
00:11:14,414 --> 00:11:16,750
MATT: I know, but it's fun to push it that way.

147
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,138
TALIESIN: I feel this is a little one-sided.

148
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:25,101
MATT: But yeah, with his tongue removed and the 
symbol burned into his forehead, he was thrown

149
00:11:25,158 --> 00:11:31,260
out the window, and the party then escaped into
the night rain, returning to their tavern, and

150
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:38,090
that was where we left off. So. As you guys come
in from the soaking-wet rain that seemed to have

151
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:43,695
been now pouring continuously through the city of
Whitestone, you come to the quiet of your tavern,

152
00:11:43,731 --> 00:11:50,856
the sun beginning to find its way, setting across
the evening sky. What would you like to do?

153
00:11:50,856 --> 00:11:53,864
LIAM: I'm having a real hard time roleplaying
right now.

154
00:11:53,864 --> 00:11:59,151
MATT: I don't know what you mean. What are you
doing Vax? Come on.

155
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:04,512
LAURA: It's actually really difficult to play a
character when you're dressed as a different

156
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,848
character, not going to lie.

157
00:12:06,948 --> 00:12:08,534
MATT: Well, we're going to learn!

158
00:12:08,534 --> 00:12:09,864
LAURA: We're going to learn how to do it.

159
00:12:09,864 --> 00:12:14,424
MARISHA: You wanna roleplay as the character
you're dressed as. Yeah, it's hard.

160
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:15,851
Don't do that.

161
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:18,646
TRAVIS: I don't know, I feel as groggy as ever.

162
00:12:18,646 --> 00:12:20,432
MATT: I don't think Scanlan's going to have a
problem tonight.

163
00:12:20,432 --> 00:12:24,045
SAM: Nope, this is how I imagine myself to be.

164
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:32,286
LIAM: I am not going to look at that table at all
tonight. All auditory for you three. Sorry.

165
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:34,454
LAURA: So we are-- wait, I forget.

166
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,548
MATT: You guys just now returned to the tavern.

167
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:44,333
LAURA: We're in the tavern. It's nighttime now?

168
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:47,942
MATT: It's starting to push later into the evening, now you
guys have returned to the tavern.

169
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:52,942
SAM: And as we returned to the tavern, did we see
hustle and bustle of people rising up in

170
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:54,500
rebellion, by any chance?

171
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,895
MATT: Not yet.

172
00:12:55,895 --> 00:12:58,103
MARISHA: Overnight rebellion!

173
00:12:58,103 --> 00:13:01,576
MATT: It's been fairly fresh since you even
started the word of it.

174
00:13:01,576 --> 00:13:05,300
TRAVIS: We were very discreet and discreetly
putting the Dust of Tracelessness on the ground.

175
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,285
MATT: Yes, you were, and you're finding your way
through, there doesn't appear to be anyone following.

176
00:13:08,285 --> 00:13:13,801
Plus there was a large distraction with Sir
Kerrion's homestead being lit on fire. The rain

177
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:18,438
taking care of most of it, but it drew people out
of their homes to see this giant blazing symbol of

178
00:13:18,438 --> 00:13:24,054
the de Rolo family burning across the rooftop. So
a message was definitely left and probably

179
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:28,505
received by somebody, and what are your plans?

180
00:13:28,505 --> 00:13:32,189
TRAVIS: One down, how many left? How many are
there left?

181
00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:34,250
MARISHA: Four? Four.

182
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,550
TALIESIN: Four.

183
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,381
TRAVIS: There are five total? Whoa, I did math.

184
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:41,446
MARISHA: There are six barrels. One is empty.

185
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:50,672
SAM: Do you think the other two are-- the barrel
names: so two are Sylas and Delilah.

186
00:13:50,672 --> 00:13:51,603
TALIESIN: Yes.

187
00:13:51,603 --> 00:13:57,497
SAM: And we know that one of the other two barrel
names resides in that place that we found. The

188
00:13:57,497 --> 00:13:59,131
countess, what was her name? The doctor?

189
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,330
TALIESIN: Doctor Ripley.

190
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,176
SAM: And what's the fourth name?

191
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:03,965
TALIESIN: Professor Anders.

192
00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:07,911
LAURA: Are we really going to talk about names
right now and not about the giant creepy smoke

193
00:14:07,911 --> 00:14:09,717
monster that came out of you, Percy?

194
00:14:09,717 --> 00:14:16,296
LIAM: I think we need to find a place to lay low.
Not here, not where we've been. Somewhere else. I

195
00:14:16,296 --> 00:14:17,637
think we need to scope out another place.

196
00:14:17,637 --> 00:14:19,002
LAURA: I don't think it's safe to leave tonight.

197
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:23,469
SAM: I agree with Vex that we can't leave tonight.
The streets are going to be crawling with guards

198
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:24,943
and people looking for us.

199
00:14:24,943 --> 00:14:27,187
MARISHA: Are we back in our hole where we were?

200
00:14:27,187 --> 00:14:29,117
MATT: You're back in the tavern where you guys
were.

201
00:14:29,117 --> 00:14:32,900
LAURA: It might be smart to be down in the cellar
tonight, not up.

202
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,443
TALIESIN: I agree.

203
00:14:34,443 --> 00:14:40,085
SAM: Is there any sort of way you can close us in
and make it look like it's a single-story

204
00:14:40,085 --> 00:14:41,157
dwelling?

205
00:14:41,157 --> 00:14:42,165
MARISHA: Yeah.

206
00:14:42,165 --> 00:14:45,897
LIAM: Yeah, we'll go down to the tree and we'll
make it look like no one's ever tunneled down

207
00:14:45,897 --> 00:14:46,851
there before.

208
00:14:46,851 --> 00:14:50,412
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean we can literally camp next
to the roots of the tree if we want to. I made it

209
00:14:50,412 --> 00:14:51,560
look nice in there.

210
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,646
LAURA: Okay.

211
00:14:52,646 --> 00:14:55,457
MARISHA: I can clear out a bit more space.

212
00:14:55,457 --> 00:14:57,382
LAURA: Burt, your mustache is falling off.

213
00:14:57,382 --> 00:14:58,744
SAM: It is?

214
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:08,396
LIAM: (giggles) You know the situation is very
dire, I don't know why I'm laughing, it's a

215
00:15:08,396 --> 00:15:09,840
nervous habit. I'm sorry.

216
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,530
MARISHA: Speaking of nervous habits.

217
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:19,526
SAM: One of us has a nervous habit of ejecting
smoke from his rib cage.

218
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:26,513
MARISHA: I was also thinking about the weird cough
that you have. I don't think you're getting sick.

219
00:15:26,513 --> 00:15:33,038
What's going on? Oh, and we've tunneled, right?
We're below the ground.

220
00:15:33,038 --> 00:15:35,617
MATT: You guys have made your way to the inn, if
you all wanted to go down and to the tree--

221
00:15:35,617 --> 00:15:40,036
MARISHA: Let's go down into the cellar. I'm going
to go ahead and throw up some walls.

222
00:15:40,036 --> 00:15:43,082
TRAVIS: Walls, or the false ground?

223
00:15:43,082 --> 00:15:45,218
MARISHA: I can do the false terrain--

224
00:15:45,218 --> 00:15:46,333
LAURA: Yeah, do that.

225
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:54,445
MARISHA: I'll do Hallucinatory Terrain, and I will
make it look like she said. One story, no cellar.

226
00:15:54,445 --> 00:15:55,839
MATT: Okay.

227
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,669
SAM: So the opening to the cellar will be just a
dirt floor.

228
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:01,419
MARISHA: Just wooden floor, yeah.

229
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:02,597
MATT: All right.

230
00:16:02,597 --> 00:16:04,795
MARISHA: No one's here, looks like it hasn't been
touched.

231
00:16:04,795 --> 00:16:05,867
MATT: Okay.

232
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:09,882
TALIESIN: Those eyes make you look far more
sarcastic than you normally do.

233
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:11,655
MATT: Do they?

234
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:13,187
TALIESIN: (shouting) Argh, god!

235
00:16:13,187 --> 00:16:16,675
(laughter)

236
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,369
LAURA: And he doesn't even smile at all.

237
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:19,918
TRAVIS: Jeez, you're the worst.

238
00:16:19,918 --> 00:16:25,220
LIAM: So Percival, spill your guts. What the fuck
is going on?

239
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:33,125
TALIESIN: I don't entirely know. Where to begin?

240
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:37,418
LIAM: You didn't look surprised when that
happened.

241
00:16:37,418 --> 00:16:43,792
MARISHA: No, in fact, you pulled down your mask,
which you don't normally do in battles.

242
00:16:43,792 --> 00:16:56,488
TALIESIN: It felt-- it didn't feel like a
surprise. I don't know. It didn't feel good. I was

243
00:16:56,488 --> 00:16:57,991
hoping it would.

244
00:16:57,991 --> 00:17:01,527
LAURA: You didn't seem to mind it as it was
happening.

245
00:17:01,527 --> 00:17:03,986
TALIESIN: I think I wanted him to recognize me.

246
00:17:03,986 --> 00:17:05,537
MARISHA: Who?

247
00:17:05,537 --> 00:17:09,794
TALIESIN: Kerrion. I don't know. I was hoping it
would feel better.

248
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:14,847
MARISHA: Could you feel it happening while it was?
Were you conscious? Do you remember what you did?

249
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:19,377
LIAM: What the fuck is it? What is it, Percival?
What is it?

250
00:17:19,377 --> 00:17:32,456
TALIESIN: A few years ago, I had a dream. I had a
very intense dream, and in this dream, something

251
00:17:32,456 --> 00:17:43,641
asked me if I wanted revenge. If I wanted the
means to have revenge. And all I would have to do

252
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:50,320
in return is offer up the souls of those I took.

253
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,136
LAURA: (flatly) Oh, that's all.

254
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:53,215
SAM: Wait, what?

255
00:17:53,215 --> 00:17:58,193
TALIESIN: It was a dream! It was just a dream.

256
00:17:58,193 --> 00:18:05,156
SAM: And yet you've fashioned your entire life's
goal upon this dream.

257
00:18:05,156 --> 00:18:15,783
TALIESIN: I woke up in the morning with an idea,
and I built that idea. I thought it was prophetic,

258
00:18:15,783 --> 00:18:24,678
and lately I've been feeling a bit of strain, and
recalling it, but it was just a dream!

259
00:18:24,678 --> 00:18:29,134
SAM: So the day after this dream was when you
first developed your Pepperbox?

260
00:18:29,134 --> 00:18:37,679
TALIESIN: It's not the first time I felt inspired
in my life. I just-- it wasn't real.

261
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:46,104
MARISHA: And Percy, how long after the coup and
after you lost your family was this dream?

262
00:18:46,104 --> 00:18:57,349
TALIESIN: (sighs) Maybe a year. I was fuzzy at
first; I wasn't really me anymore. I was a

263
00:18:57,349 --> 00:19:06,498
fisherman for a while. I didn't do anything. This
was something to do with myself; this was

264
00:19:06,498 --> 00:19:08,621
something to work towards.

265
00:19:08,621 --> 00:19:14,024
LIAM: Well, we're clearly not talking about a
dream anymore. We all saw it. Do you have any

266
00:19:14,024 --> 00:19:15,437
theories?

267
00:19:15,437 --> 00:19:23,334
TALIESIN: I don't. I don't know. I've never
thought about it. It didn't matter.

268
00:19:23,334 --> 00:19:27,192
LIAM: It matters now.

269
00:19:27,192 --> 00:19:29,876
TALIESIN: I don't know what to do.

270
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:32,114
LAURA: Who is the last bullet for?

271
00:19:32,114 --> 00:19:41,449
TALIESIN: (sighs)

272
00:19:41,497 --> 00:19:44,452
LAURA: We don't want to lose you, Percy.

273
00:19:44,504 --> 00:19:49,514
TALIESIN: When I started this, I talked to a man,
at one point. He was the captain of one of the

274
00:19:49,514 --> 00:20:03,034
vessels I was on. I told him what I intended to
do, and I showed him what I was building. And he

275
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:14,678
said that if I really wanted revenge, if revenge
was what I was after, that there would be no

276
00:20:14,678 --> 00:20:19,874
stopping it. And there would be casualties along
the way, and I would have to give up things, and I

277
00:20:19,874 --> 00:20:31,340
would have to hurt people. And that was the price,
so that last barrel is because it's not just five

278
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:36,044
names; I know I'm going to have to keep hurting
people and that this thing existing is just going

279
00:20:36,044 --> 00:20:43,451
to keep hurting people. It's the knowledge that it
never ends. It's because I haven't just killed

280
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:52,557
five people. I've killed a lot of people on my
way here. I've killed them with you. And it's to

281
00:20:52,611 --> 00:20:56,092
remind me that this is what I've chosen.

282
00:20:56,092 --> 00:21:02,906
LIAM: I don't understand. We've killed with
reason.

283
00:21:02,906 --> 00:21:08,437
TALIESIN: And I have tried to. And I certainly
have reason for these five names. They are not

284
00:21:08,437 --> 00:21:12,100
good people. These are not people who should be
allowed to live.

285
00:21:12,148 --> 00:21:20,019
LIAM: None of us debate that the Briarwoods and
their circle should be allowed to go on. We all

286
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:26,120
understand what they're capable of. We all
understand that they need to be removed. But what

287
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:32,512
we just saw goes beyond, and you're telling us
that this is going to continue after the

288
00:21:32,512 --> 00:21:39,647
Briarwoods and their like are gone. What are we to
look forward to, Percival? Where are we going?

289
00:21:39,647 --> 00:21:45,843
TALIESIN: I was hoping that once I'd finished
serving revenge that perhaps I could serve

290
00:21:45,843 --> 00:21:47,238
repentance.

291
00:21:47,276 --> 00:21:58,596
MARISHA: You're speaking of these as if they're
metaphysical beings. You're serving revenge. That

292
00:21:58,596 --> 00:22:05,631
sounds very literal, and from what I've seen,
isn't inaccurate.

293
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:16,855
TALIESIN: I no longer feel in control. I no longer
trust myself. I wouldn't expect you to trust me.

294
00:22:16,855 --> 00:22:20,851
LIAM: Stretching a little thin right now, Percy.

295
00:22:20,851 --> 00:22:22,505
TALIESIN: But I trust you.

296
00:22:22,505 --> 00:22:26,550
SAM: Can I just do a quick insight to see if
he's being entirely honest?

297
00:22:26,601 --> 00:22:27,910
MATT: You may.

298
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:33,487
SAM: Well, that didn't work. Much better. 18.

299
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:36,449
MATT: 18. Go ahead and roll a dice, Percival.

300
00:22:36,449 --> 00:22:38,562
TALIESIN: Dice plus what?

301
00:22:38,562 --> 00:22:41,764
MATT: Actually, I'll roll it for you. What's
your bonus?

302
00:22:41,923 --> 00:22:42,980
TALIESIN: For which?

303
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,916
MATT: For both persuasion and deception.

304
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:52,722
TALIESIN: Persuasion and deception? Persuasion,
six. Deception, two.

305
00:22:52,722 --> 00:23:04,351
MATT: Okay. He seems very earnest, very broken.
Confused, but driven, and there isn't any part of

306
00:23:04,351 --> 00:23:11,533
his voice that seems to conceal or attempt to hold
back any information.

307
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:18,438
TRAVIS: Are you afraid you're going to hurt us?

308
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:22,154
TALIESIN: No. I'm afraid I'm going to disappoint
you.

309
00:23:22,154 --> 00:23:26,917
MARISHA: How would you disappoint us?

310
00:23:26,917 --> 00:23:35,197
TALIESIN: I trust that you are all here in the
service of justice and maybe friendship. But I'm

311
00:23:35,197 --> 00:23:43,370
not. I'm here for revenge. And as much as I would
like to believe otherwise, I know that's not true.

312
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:54,809
And I think I need people here who are not here
for revenge. I don't know how to stop this.

313
00:23:54,809 --> 00:24:01,513
MARISHA: Just because you started on this path for
revenge doesn't mean you can't find other

314
00:24:01,513 --> 00:24:08,120
motivations along the way. Do you believe you're
not doing this with your friends or for your

315
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,946
friends? Not even a little bit; it's only a
hundred percent revenge?

316
00:24:11,946 --> 00:24:20,989
TALIESIN: No one does anything purely for one
reason. And I could justify it, but I'd be lying.

317
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:30,642
I want to hurt them. I want them to know it's me.
I want them to feel remorse for what they have

318
00:24:30,642 --> 00:24:37,357
done. I want them to pay, and if this thing is
real, if this is really what is happening now, I

319
00:24:37,357 --> 00:24:42,336
hope that wherever they go, they suffer forever
and beyond.

320
00:24:42,336 --> 00:24:44,857
TRAVIS: I think that sounds fair.

321
00:24:44,857 --> 00:24:53,574
TALIESIN: And I'm so grateful there is justice to
be found in it, but it is not justice that I am

322
00:24:53,574 --> 00:25:03,064
motivated by. And I couldn't pretend it would be.
I am so grateful there is justice in this. But

323
00:25:03,064 --> 00:25:05,316
even if there wasn't, I would still be here.

324
00:25:05,351 --> 00:25:14,922
LIAM: I want to talk about a plan, because our
desires are in lockstep up to a point. Once we

325
00:25:14,922 --> 00:25:20,390
have gotten rid of the last of them, I want to
know what happens then, Percival.

326
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:34,288
TALIESIN: I've never had to think of this before.
I think if we get out of this, either I'm going to

327
00:25:34,288 --> 00:25:36,705
need you to save me or finish me.

328
00:25:36,705 --> 00:25:38,835
LAURA: No, we won't do that.

329
00:25:38,835 --> 00:25:40,669
TALIESIN: If it comes to it.

330
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:46,083
LAURA: Damn it, where is Pike?! She would know
about this.

331
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:47,414
TRAVIS: She would.

332
00:25:47,414 --> 00:25:48,966
MARISHA: I miss Pike.

333
00:25:48,966 --> 00:25:54,419
TALIESIN: Well, I do want to save this city.

334
00:25:54,419 --> 00:26:02,305
LAURA: Can we do any kind of religion check to see
if we know anything about this kind of entity?

335
00:26:02,305 --> 00:26:06,949
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and make a religion check.

336
00:26:06,949 --> 00:26:11,886
TRAVIS: Three.

337
00:26:11,886 --> 00:26:14,187
MATT: Suiting.

338
00:26:14,187 --> 00:26:15,889
MARISHA: (laughs) Suiting.

339
00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:17,389
LAURA: 17.

340
00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:25,511
MATT: I mean, there are all sorts of extraplanar
entities throughout the realms that have their own

341
00:26:25,511 --> 00:26:26,494
individual descriptions.

342
00:26:26,494 --> 00:26:29,480
MARISHA: Whenever he starts a description with "I
mean," it's not good.

343
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:35,153
MATT: You don't have a whole lot of experience
outside of the realm of mortals. You've had a few

344
00:26:35,153 --> 00:26:42,407
interactions with things that skew beyond that
realm. While you get that he's saying it may just

345
00:26:42,407 --> 00:26:49,069
be a dream, you know that there are multitudes of
creatures that thrive on these types of bargains.

346
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:55,988
You do know that many of these bargains in the
long run do not end up being wholly in the

347
00:26:55,988 --> 00:26:57,989
person's favor who struck it.

348
00:26:57,989 --> 00:27:04,066
TRAVIS: Well, look. It's going to help him on his
quest, get revenge and kill all the people that

349
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:09,056
killed his family, right? So can we do that, and
then if it gets out of control, we bop him on

350
00:27:09,056 --> 00:27:11,298
the head and take him to a temple?

351
00:27:11,507 --> 00:27:15,025
LAURA: I think that's the best plan we have,
actually.

352
00:27:15,025 --> 00:27:18,224
TRAVIS: I mean, you were really awesome in that
last fight.

353
00:27:18,224 --> 00:27:20,617
LAURA: You did look pretty amazing, I'm not going
to lie.

354
00:27:20,617 --> 00:27:24,076
TRAVIS: A little bit of pee came out. It was that
good.

355
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:28,437
LAURA: But I don't like how dark it went, Percy.
It went really dark.

356
00:27:28,437 --> 00:27:38,933
LIAM: And here's the thing. There's a thing. There
it is, right there. Here's the thing.

357
00:27:38,933 --> 00:27:41,988
TALIESIN: Oh god, I hadn't even noticed. So
sorry.

358
00:27:41,988 --> 00:27:47,638
LIAM: Your chances of succeeding here
alone are pretty fucking slim. And if you want us

359
00:27:47,689 --> 00:27:55,564
all to work with you, you can't go from door to
door, bringing wrath and ruin the way you just

360
00:27:55,564 --> 00:28:00,672
did, or you won't have our assistance. Not all of
us.

361
00:28:00,672 --> 00:28:08,075
SAM: Now now, Vax, what are you talking about? We
all knew what we were doing when we-- pay

362
00:28:08,075 --> 00:28:14,569
attention to me! I'm trying to be serious here.
Don't you turn your eyes away from me. Look at me

363
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:20,471
when I'm talking to you. We all knew what we were
doing when we went into the house. It was an

364
00:28:20,471 --> 00:28:27,616
assassination mission. I don't understand why
everyone's harping on how dark it got. We knew

365
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,754
we were there to kill everyone in the whole
place.

366
00:28:29,754 --> 00:28:32,521
LIAM: This is a city oppressed. These people did
not invite it upon themselves.

367
00:28:32,521 --> 00:28:37,195
LAURA: That guy deserved it, but we did rip his
tongue out, which I think was a bit harsh.

368
00:28:37,195 --> 00:28:38,718
TRAVIS: He said take his tongue.

369
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:44,182
LIAM: These people don't want to exchange one
warlord for another. We need to maybe dial it back

370
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:45,317
a tick or two.

371
00:28:45,317 --> 00:28:46,750
SAM: No, I disagree.

372
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,471
TRAVIS: I do, too, Pedostache.

373
00:28:48,471 --> 00:28:58,094
SAM: We have to make a strong appearance. This is
shock and awe. We're not going to win over the

374
00:28:58,094 --> 00:29:05,831
people by half measures and hey, let's hold an
election, or something. We have to kill everyone

375
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:08,787
in as dramatic a fashion as possible.

376
00:29:08,787 --> 00:29:10,922
LAURA: This is beheading a pony all over again.

377
00:29:10,922 --> 00:29:14,491
LIAM: You think we're going to win them over by
showing them how disgusting we are?

378
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:17,576
SAM: No, how disgusting they are, and how
disgusting they die.

379
00:29:17,576 --> 00:29:20,618
LIAM: No. I mean the civilians here.

380
00:29:20,618 --> 00:29:22,613
LAURA: We're not going to kill civilians!

381
00:29:22,613 --> 00:29:26,514
LIAM: Of course, but we're trying to win them
over, and if we're showing that we're ripping out

382
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:30,533
their tongues and pulling their ears off and
flaying their balls, they're going to be just as

383
00:29:30,533 --> 00:29:32,608
scared of us as they are of the Briarwoods.

384
00:29:32,608 --> 00:29:35,872
LAURA: They'll probably be pretty happy that the
people that have been hurting them are being

385
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,837
punished.

386
00:29:36,837 --> 00:29:40,857
MARISHA: Yes, they've been oppressed, but we've
also seen there's plenty of cases of people being

387
00:29:40,897 --> 00:29:47,065
charmed by them. We might have an army of people
who will die for the Briarwoods at any cost and

388
00:29:47,065 --> 00:29:49,089
not even realizing they're being charmed that
way.

389
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:51,982
SAM: I wouldn't mind a few people being scared of
us, too.

390
00:29:51,982 --> 00:30:02,600
TALIESIN: I will say it did get out of hand. And
if I had known then what I know now, I would hope

391
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:10,428
that you would restrain me in those moments where
I seem to be going further than I should.

392
00:30:10,428 --> 00:30:11,642
LAURA: Done.

393
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:15,823
TRAVIS: Are you saying for your final bullet, you
want us to stop you?

394
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:20,665
LAURA: No, he's saying that if he goes dark, if he
goes against his person that we know--

395
00:30:20,665 --> 00:30:22,435
TALIESIN: Knock me out and take me to a temple.

396
00:30:22,435 --> 00:30:24,555
TRAVIS: You don't want to scratch the name off the
barrel?

397
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:29,378
TALIESIN: I didn't know it was going
to disappear, to be fair. I thought that maybe I

398
00:30:29,414 --> 00:30:33,861
could stop what was happening to me. I panicked.

399
00:30:33,861 --> 00:30:38,770
MARISHA: Percy, do you realize we tried to talk to
you for a good 15 minutes after all that last

400
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:47,953
night, and you were unreachable? Do you remember
that? So us saying if you start getting out of

401
00:30:47,953 --> 00:30:52,567
control, and you think that we're going to be able
to be like, yo Percy, calm it down a bit--

402
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:55,928
LAURA: We're not going to do that. We're going to
knock him the fuck out!

403
00:30:55,928 --> 00:30:57,177
TALIESIN: Yes.

404
00:30:57,177 --> 00:30:59,546
LAURA: Don't worry, Percy. We've got you.

405
00:30:59,546 --> 00:31:05,615
SAM: I don't think I would knock him out.

406
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:08,854
TRAVIS: I'll knock you out if you really want me
to.

407
00:31:08,854 --> 00:31:15,105
TALIESIN: If I start to turn against you. If you
think for a moment that I am out of control.

408
00:31:15,105 --> 00:31:26,652
Please, <i>please,</i> do what is necessary. The moment
that I turn on any of you, the moment that I even

409
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:32,672
threaten any of you is a moment I am not in
control. No matter what is happening.

410
00:31:32,672 --> 00:31:34,150
TRAVIS: Yeah. Okay.

411
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:43,310
LAURA: I walk up and I kiss him on the cheek. and
I say: Don't you worry, we've got you.

412
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,714
TALIESIN: Especially with the cough, thank you.

413
00:31:45,714 --> 00:31:48,870
LAURA: I don't believe you're really sick,
darling.

414
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,764
SAM: Vex, I've heard a cough like that, and it's
probably syphilis.

415
00:31:51,764 --> 00:31:54,117
LAURA: Lovely. Thank you, Scanlan.

416
00:31:54,117 --> 00:31:57,193
TALIESIN: I barely sl-- I don't, I--

417
00:31:57,193 --> 00:32:00,834
SAM: Personal experience, that's all I'm saying.

418
00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:06,043
TRAVIS: Shall we rest and then we go find another
house?

419
00:32:06,043 --> 00:32:13,054
MARISHA: Well, maybe we should, now that we have
the knock-Percy-out-in-case-of-emergency plan,

420
00:32:13,054 --> 00:32:20,228
should we have a revolution plan? Because we seem
to be divided on that.

421
00:32:20,228 --> 00:32:25,021
TALIESIN: There's still two more lords in the
city. And there is the castle. They know we're

422
00:32:25,021 --> 00:32:26,720
here now.

423
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:33,757
SAM: It might behoove us to spend a day or two
finding another shelter, and also seeing what our

424
00:32:33,757 --> 00:32:40,008
actions have resulted in, and seeing if we can't
sway some opinion in our favor, because we're

425
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:48,188
strong, but we're also pretty weak these days, and
I wouldn't want to go against the big guns yet

426
00:32:48,188 --> 00:32:54,439
until we have the people behind us. Or at least
possibly turn one of those giants to our side or

427
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,275
something. We need some help.

428
00:32:56,275 --> 00:33:02,371
LAURA: We have a map of the city, yes? I think it
best to stay off the streets. Is it possible,

429
00:33:02,371 --> 00:33:05,115
Keyleth, to tunnel through the city, underneath
it?

430
00:33:05,115 --> 00:33:06,796
TALIESIN: Good idea.

431
00:33:06,796 --> 00:33:08,916
MARISHA: I can, actually. Yeah.

432
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:12,062
SAM: Can't really talk to people that way.

433
00:33:12,062 --> 00:33:18,328
LAURA: No, but they know we're here. It's not
safe. We can come up in secret, leave symbols to

434
00:33:18,328 --> 00:33:21,467
rally the people, and hide again.

435
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:24,277
MARISHA: You want to get a beat on the vibe of
what people are saying out there?

436
00:33:24,313 --> 00:33:36,017
SAM: Hey, hep cat, yes. I'm wanting to get a beat
on the vibe. Yes, I think we need to hear what

437
00:33:36,017 --> 00:33:40,343
people are saying. In the privacy of their homes,
maybe. Do some snooping.

438
00:33:40,343 --> 00:33:43,281
MARISHA: Well, there's a few people in our party
who are good at that.

439
00:33:43,281 --> 00:33:46,842
SAM: And we need to find another potential
safehouse.

440
00:33:46,842 --> 00:33:54,016
MARISHA: Okay, that's plan number one, then. I
think it's not a bad idea that we spread this de

441
00:33:54,016 --> 00:33:55,929
Rolo family crest around.

442
00:33:55,929 --> 00:33:59,173
TALIESIN: Have we been to the Alcove yet?

443
00:33:59,173 --> 00:34:04,102
MATT: You went to the Alcove-- no, you have not
been to the Alcove.

444
00:34:04,102 --> 00:34:12,166
TALIESIN: We haven't been to the Alcove or the
barracks yet. The barracks are right against the

445
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:13,346
castle, though.

446
00:34:13,346 --> 00:34:18,556
MATT: Correct. You went to the Lady's Chamber and
you spoke briefly with Keeper Yennen.

447
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,115
TALIESIN: Yeah, with Keeper Yennen.

448
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:22,746
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go to the barracks.

449
00:34:22,746 --> 00:34:25,701
MATT: And you went to Beyond the Horizon, which was
abandoned and partially collapsed.

450
00:34:25,701 --> 00:34:30,712
TALIESIN: The barracks will be our last stop, I
believe. Just because it's outside the city proper

451
00:34:30,712 --> 00:34:41,421
and it's up the hill. We might be able to stay at
the Alcove, which is a magic shop that used to be

452
00:34:41,421 --> 00:34:46,493
in town. I know the proprietor, or I did, if he's
still alive.

453
00:34:46,493 --> 00:34:48,225
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go there.

454
00:34:48,225 --> 00:34:51,647
MARISHA: Magic shop? Okay.

455
00:34:51,647 --> 00:34:54,626
TALIESIN: It was a magic shop, right?

456
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:57,830
MATT: Yeah, it's an arcane boutique, yes.

457
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,094
TALIESIN: An arcane boutique.

458
00:34:59,094 --> 00:35:01,003
MARISHA: Are we tunneling there?

459
00:35:01,003 --> 00:35:02,899
LAURA: Are we going there now? Are we resting?

460
00:35:02,899 --> 00:35:04,147
SAM: We should rest.

461
00:35:04,147 --> 00:35:05,838
MARISHA: It's nighttime!

462
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:10,556
MATT: Right now, I would say, based on
preparation, the illusion-casting, conversation,

463
00:35:10,556 --> 00:35:13,086
you're looking at about 9:00, 9:30 in the evening.

464
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:16,786
TALIESIN: We could get an early start once the
light hits.

465
00:35:16,786 --> 00:35:19,752
SAM: If you fall asleep, is that illusion going to
vanish?

466
00:35:19,752 --> 00:35:24,696
MARISHA: No, I think Hallucinatory Terrain lasts
for--

467
00:35:24,696 --> 00:35:31,184
LAURA: Can I sense anything near us? Can I sense
vampires above us?

468
00:35:31,184 --> 00:35:32,919
MATT: So you're looking for undead?

469
00:35:32,919 --> 00:35:33,857
LAURA: Undead.

470
00:35:33,857 --> 00:35:42,372
MATT: Okay. You feel a surrounding presence
scattered throughout the city, some large, some

471
00:35:42,372 --> 00:35:48,125
small. You can gather over a period of time of
concentration, you can feel the slow movement of

472
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:56,174
the zombie giants moving through the city, the
sentinels slowly tromping through, and a number of

473
00:35:56,174 --> 00:35:58,053
other undead entities there.

474
00:35:58,053 --> 00:36:04,196
LAURA: Does it feel like there's more in motion
than there were before we set off the blaze?

475
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:10,290
MATT: I would say yes, there appears to be a
little more haste and movement to what entities you

476
00:36:10,338 --> 00:36:16,985
can-- and you can't pinpoint specifics, but you do
sense that there is a heightened state of

477
00:36:16,985 --> 00:36:21,451
movement, to what you've previously sensed.

478
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:22,340
LAURA: Okay.

479
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:27,100
LIAM: Yes I've a thought that at night, obviously,
these streets are full of dead things. Tomorrow,

480
00:36:27,149 --> 00:36:32,378
the Briarwoods and the people that work for them
are going to start pulling people out of their

481
00:36:32,378 --> 00:36:38,060
houses and telling them to look for us or anyone
who's not from this city, so I don't think that

482
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:42,223
the beggar routine is going to work for much
longer.

483
00:36:42,223 --> 00:36:43,905
LAURA: That's why we stay under the city. That's
what I said.

484
00:36:43,905 --> 00:36:46,719
LIAM: Of course, but if you want to talk to
people, I think we could probably get away with

485
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:49,886
poking about first thing in the morning and that's
it.

486
00:36:49,886 --> 00:36:52,609
MARISHA: Okay.

487
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:54,924
LIAM: So we should probably get up early.

488
00:36:54,924 --> 00:36:56,222
LAURA: All right.

489
00:36:56,222 --> 00:37:01,791
SAM: And in addition to your excellent illusion
spell--

490
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:03,302
MARISHA: Which lasts for 24 hours.

491
00:37:03,302 --> 00:37:10,536
SAM: That's wonderful to hear. Is there any other
means of protection we have? I mean, if they are

492
00:37:10,536 --> 00:37:14,792
magic wielders, they might be able to sense our
presence or something. Is there any way to obscure

493
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:20,097
that? I guess I'm asking this, but I'm one of the
only two magic wielders here, so I should know the

494
00:37:20,097 --> 00:37:20,888
answer.

495
00:37:20,888 --> 00:37:26,790
MARISHA: I was going to say, it would be probably
a me and you thing. In terms of making us not as

496
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:30,252
noticeable, Seeming is probably going to be our
closest thing. I don't have anything--

497
00:37:30,252 --> 00:37:31,740
SAM: It's just a visual, though.

498
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,293
LAURA: Nothing like a bubble of protection or
anything?

499
00:37:34,348 --> 00:37:35,936
MARISHA: I've got my Antilife Shell.

500
00:37:35,936 --> 00:37:44,895
LAURA: But they're undead. Lovely. Well, first
watch. Who's taking it?

501
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:51,895
MARISHA: We can all get a good night's sleep, I
think, if I tunnel us in and we've got

502
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:52,994
Hallucinatory Terrain.

503
00:37:52,994 --> 00:37:55,287
LAURA: I still think we should keep watch.

504
00:37:55,287 --> 00:37:57,642
TRAVIS: Percy's got it, yeah. I'll take second.

505
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,837
TALIESIN: All right.

506
00:37:58,837 --> 00:38:03,498
MATT: So you're all down at the bottom of the
tunnel by the roots of the Sun Tree? And you have

507
00:38:03,498 --> 00:38:06,058
Hallucinatory Terrained the cellar?

508
00:38:06,058 --> 00:38:06,881
MARISHA: Yeah.

509
00:38:06,881 --> 00:38:09,152
LAURA: I hate that he's asking for clarification.

510
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,697
MATT: What?

511
00:38:10,697 --> 00:38:13,765
LAURA: Don't 'what?' me.

512
00:38:13,765 --> 00:38:15,586
MATT: What's the DC of your spell?

513
00:38:15,633 --> 00:38:18,041
MARISHA: Of Hallucinatory Terrain?

514
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:20,243
MATT: Of all your spellcasting, what's the DC?

515
00:38:20,243 --> 00:38:27,770
MARISHA: It's 17. No, 18. But I know they have to
make an intelligence save to see through

516
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,386
Hallucinatory Terrain.

517
00:38:29,386 --> 00:38:31,780
MATT: Correct. If something were interested in
doing so.

518
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,053
MARISHA: Exactly, hypothetically.

519
00:38:34,053 --> 00:38:35,335
MATT: So who's taking first watch?

520
00:38:35,335 --> 00:38:36,242
TRAVIS: Percy.

521
00:38:36,242 --> 00:38:37,543
SAM: I will watch with him.

522
00:38:37,543 --> 00:38:39,214
MARISHA: Yeah, Percy can't watch alone.

523
00:38:39,214 --> 00:38:40,565
TALIESIN: No, that's fine.

524
00:38:40,565 --> 00:38:41,852
SAM: I'll watch with him.

525
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:44,612
LIAM: I mean, I raised my hand before, but that's
all right. I'll get some sleep.

526
00:38:44,612 --> 00:38:50,476
MATT: Okay. It's tight quarters. And you know,
other than either a magical light or torch someone

527
00:38:50,476 --> 00:38:54,351
wants to put up, there is no light source. It is
pitch black down here. What are you guys using as

528
00:38:54,351 --> 00:38:56,139
a light source, or are you leaving it pitch dark?

529
00:38:56,139 --> 00:38:58,176
LAURA: Well, you can light your little flaming
warhammer.

530
00:38:58,176 --> 00:39:06,102
TRAVIS: Fine. I take the Flaming Warhammer, and I
whisper the magic word, bacon.

531
00:39:06,102 --> 00:39:08,553
And it turns on fire.

532
00:39:08,553 --> 00:39:10,437
LAURA: I'm pretty sure he just said bagel.

533
00:39:10,437 --> 00:39:12,933
MARISHA: Bagel?

534
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:29,870
MATT: All righty. So, you guys take first watch,
rest is till about 11PM or midnight or so. You

535
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:38,043
guys finish. Who's taking second watch? All right,
we've got Grog and Vax. All right so, you guys--

536
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:43,779
LIAM: While Percival is sleeping, I pull Grog over
and we look at him for a while, and I say, where

537
00:39:43,779 --> 00:39:46,451
do you think the smoke comes out of?

538
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:48,384
TRAVIS: Oh, that's a good question.

539
00:39:48,384 --> 00:39:50,217
LIAM: Do you think it's the nostrils?

540
00:39:50,217 --> 00:39:54,597
TRAVIS: No, it looked like it was coming from the
bottom up, and there's only two holes down there,

541
00:39:54,597 --> 00:39:56,558
so it's either--

542
00:39:56,558 --> 00:39:58,351
LIAM: Yeah, that's right.

543
00:39:58,351 --> 00:40:00,851
TRAVIS: Either the dirt button--

544
00:40:00,851 --> 00:40:06,680
LIAM: It could just be his pores. You're right,
it's probably--

545
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,984
TRAVIS: It's probably the periscope. You're
right.

546
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:19,110
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
the air down here, it's damp earth. It's chilled

547
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:22,683
in the night, anyway, but it's a little warmer
because you're under the ground, and it's absorbed

548
00:40:22,683 --> 00:40:27,286
some of the heat of the day. But it is getting
noticeably colder.

549
00:40:27,286 --> 00:40:30,273
MARISHA: It's getting colder?

550
00:40:30,273 --> 00:40:35,116
MATT: Yeah, just as the evening progresses. The
temperature at night here--

551
00:40:35,116 --> 00:40:38,908
SAM: Colder than it did last night? Because it
also got pretty cold last night.

552
00:40:38,908 --> 00:40:53,759
MATT: Comparable, yeah. There's a low mist begins
to form within the tunnel from the temperature.

553
00:40:53,811 --> 00:40:56,903
LIAM: I wake up my sister.

554
00:40:56,903 --> 00:40:58,246
LAURA: What, what do you want?

555
00:40:58,246 --> 00:41:01,042
LIAM: There's fog or something. What's going on?

556
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:02,677
TRAVIS: It's just cold.

557
00:41:02,733 --> 00:41:05,674
LAURA: Can we see if it's magic?

558
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:07,878
MATT: Make an insight check.

559
00:41:07,878 --> 00:41:10,270
LIAM: Do that thing again. You can tell when
stuff's around.

560
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,130
LAURA: Oh good, I rolled a one.

561
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:15,073
TRAVIS: Can I do a nature check to show them it's
just fucking fog?

562
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:18,019
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and roll.

563
00:41:18,141 --> 00:41:19,393
TRAVIS: A 13.

564
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:23,996
MATT: Okay. You step forward and take a good long
look at the fog that is slowly beginning to form

565
00:41:23,996 --> 00:41:33,117
at the base of the tunnel you guys are in. As you
lean forward and take it in, the fog begins to

566
00:41:33,117 --> 00:41:40,445
form into a physical humanoid essence and reach
out for you. For the three that are conscious,

567
00:41:40,445 --> 00:41:41,942
roll initiative.

568
00:41:41,942 --> 00:41:43,562
SAM: Oh god!

569
00:41:43,562 --> 00:41:46,173
LAURA: Shit. It's a teeny tiny tunnel.

570
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:50,865
MARISHA: It's another damn ghost wraith thing
ghosting in.

571
00:41:50,865 --> 00:41:52,455
MATT: All right.

572
00:41:52,455 --> 00:41:55,239
SAM: So what if the Sun Tree is like--

573
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:56,854
LAURA: The source of the bad?

574
00:41:56,854 --> 00:41:57,732
SAM: Yeah.

575
00:41:57,732 --> 00:41:59,120
LAURA: It's possible it is.

576
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,266
MARISHA: That's kind of funny.

577
00:42:01,266 --> 00:42:05,786
(laughter)

578
00:42:05,786 --> 00:42:10,179
LAURA: What if the Briarwoods are right under the
Sun Tree, and we're right above them?

579
00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:13,359
TRAVIS: What if they didn't hang the bodies, the
tree just grabbed people?

580
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:24,567
MATT: So Grog back in the fog, Vex is waking up
the back, Trinket asleep next to her. Percy,

581
00:42:24,567 --> 00:42:26,486
Scanlan.

582
00:42:26,486 --> 00:42:29,409
TALIESIN: Actually, can you move the Wyrmwood box,
because all I'm--

583
00:42:29,409 --> 00:42:34,010
LIAM: Yes, Wyrmwood Gaming, check them out.
Beautiful boxes.

584
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,720
MATT: Indeed, all right. This will go there for
now.

585
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,311
LAURA: You look really good, Matt.

586
00:42:39,311 --> 00:42:49,464
MATT: I can't move in this. Great. All right, so.
Get some initiatives on this. For Grog?

587
00:42:49,464 --> 00:42:50,583
TRAVIS: 17.

588
00:42:50,583 --> 00:42:54,427
MATT: 17, all righty. Okay, Laura?

589
00:42:54,427 --> 00:42:55,737
LAURA: Oh, 22.

590
00:42:55,737 --> 00:42:57,450
MATT: 22, all right, and?

591
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:58,461
LIAM: 18.

592
00:42:58,461 --> 00:43:00,203
MATT: 18. Good to know.

593
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:01,471
SAM: Are we spooning?

594
00:43:01,471 --> 00:43:03,791
TALIESIN: We're sporking.

595
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:05,419
SAM: Oh, we are?

596
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:06,899
MARISHA: You guys might be sporking.

597
00:43:06,899 --> 00:43:11,342
MATT: So Vex, Grog, then you rolled a what?

598
00:43:11,342 --> 00:43:12,369
LIAM: 18.

599
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:15,301
MATT: Oh, sorry, Vax. Vex, you rolled a--

600
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,863
LAURA: 22.

601
00:43:16,951 --> 00:43:19,417
MATT: 22, right, Grog you were a--

602
00:43:19,456 --> 00:43:20,572
TRAVIS: 17.

603
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:27,505
MATT: 17, okay. So Grog, this is technically a
surprise round on you, then we'll get back to you

604
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:34,175
guys on top of the initiative. You can see now, the
mist has formed into a pale humanoid, with two

605
00:43:34,226 --> 00:43:46,259
more now that have rolled in. These pale-looking,
intensely feral human beings with elongated fangs

606
00:43:46,259 --> 00:43:48,802
emerge from this mist and immediately lunge out
towards you.

607
00:43:48,802 --> 00:43:50,411
LAURA: Are they vampires?

608
00:43:50,411 --> 00:43:52,658
MARISHA: Can they do that?

609
00:43:52,658 --> 00:43:54,451
LAURA: They can. They're fucking vampires.

610
00:43:54,451 --> 00:43:57,426
SAM: No, they can only become bats. I read about
this.

611
00:43:57,463 --> 00:44:03,392
LIAM: (sings) Let's do this.

612
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:07,319
MATT: So, first and foremost, the one that lunges
out at Grog is going to shift to the side there.

613
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:12,569
Is going to make a claw attack against you. That
is a 20 to hit?

614
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:13,531
TRAVIS: That hits.

615
00:44:13,531 --> 00:44:17,617
MATT: That hits. All right, you take eight points
of slashing damage-- or no, you do not, actually.

616
00:44:17,617 --> 00:44:24,087
Instead, it is going to attempt to grapple you.
Not attempt, it grapples you. So it reaches out

617
00:44:24,171 --> 00:44:28,935
and grasps on to some of the hide armor you have
tied around your shoulder, pulls you in, and is

618
00:44:28,935 --> 00:44:33,782
going to attempt to sink its teeth into your
actual body.

619
00:44:33,782 --> 00:44:39,078
LAURA: Don't forget that we all have our amazing
metal around our neck that Scanlan got us.

620
00:44:39,078 --> 00:44:40,685
MATT: That's true.

621
00:44:40,685 --> 00:44:46,547
(laughter)

622
00:44:46,547 --> 00:44:48,342
LIAM: You're so intimidating in that costume.

623
00:44:48,342 --> 00:44:54,560
MATT: Good. That is a 17 versus armor class.

624
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,382
TRAVIS: That misses.

625
00:44:56,382 --> 00:44:59,334
MATT: Okay, so it attempts to bite into you, you
move out of the way just in time, and that little

626
00:44:59,381 --> 00:45:03,317
bit of chain mail, that practically useless piece
of chainmail wrapped around your giant thick neck

627
00:45:03,317 --> 00:45:06,161
does manage to catch its fangs and deflect the
attack initially.

628
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:07,839
LIAM and LAURA: Hey!

629
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:15,399
SAM: What, that piece of metal thing? Hey, I made
that. I call it a Scanlan. I call everything a

630
00:45:15,399 --> 00:45:17,385
Scanlan.

631
00:45:17,385 --> 00:45:21,615
MATT: This one is going to swoop in as you are now
currently grappled by the other one. It's going to

632
00:45:21,615 --> 00:45:31,213
attempt to grab you on the other side. That is a
21 to hit, so it's going to grapple you. And this

633
00:45:31,213 --> 00:45:36,763
one is also going to now reach up with its claws
to pull down the chain mail, grasps you there.

634
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:48,401
Since it's a surprise round, natural 20. All right,
so you take five points of piercing damage, and--

635
00:45:48,401 --> 00:45:52,304
SAM: And you're a vampire.

636
00:45:52,304 --> 00:45:57,475
MATT: And 11 points of necrotic, and your maximum
hit points are reduced by 11.

637
00:45:57,475 --> 00:45:59,367
TRAVIS: Okay, really?

638
00:45:59,367 --> 00:46:00,993
LAURA: Oh no, we haven't had another feast yet.

639
00:46:00,993 --> 00:46:02,726
SAM: Oh, and the feast is gone too, isn't it?

640
00:46:02,726 --> 00:46:03,809
MARISHA: Yeah.

641
00:46:03,809 --> 00:46:08,574
MATT: So this third one over here is going to
attempt to come after you, Vax, closest to

642
00:46:08,574 --> 00:46:14,064
it. That is a 24 to hit.

643
00:46:14,116 --> 00:46:17,234
LIAM: Well, that hits, but I'm going to use
Uncanny Dodge.

644
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:18,836
MATT: Okay, to reduce the damage?

645
00:46:18,836 --> 00:46:19,790
LIAM: Yeah, by half.

646
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:28,074
MATT: That's 2d4 slashing against you. Ten points
of slashing damage.

647
00:46:28,074 --> 00:46:29,478
LIAM: Is the half?

648
00:46:29,478 --> 00:46:34,239
MATT: Yes, it's going to try to claw you again.
That's a 12.

649
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,438
LIAM: Nope.

650
00:46:35,438 --> 00:46:39,316
MATT: Yeah, so the first one slashes across the
side of your shoulder, but you manage to pull out

651
00:46:39,316 --> 00:46:44,947
of the way just in time to lessen the impact.
This, however, sets you up for the easily dodged

652
00:46:44,947 --> 00:46:49,495
second blow. You swoop out of the way just barely
in time, feeling the wind (whoosh) above your

653
00:46:49,495 --> 00:46:55,572
head. That ends their turn. Now we're at the top
of the initiative order: surprise round. This

654
00:46:55,572 --> 00:46:59,982
would not have been enough noise to wake you guys
yet, so you're going to hold on until somebody can

655
00:46:59,982 --> 00:47:03,097
get your attention. Top of the round will be Vex.

656
00:47:03,097 --> 00:47:18,221
LAURA: I'm going to say: Wake the fuck up! And I
am going to-- can I hide? Is that what I do as my

657
00:47:18,221 --> 00:47:19,166
bonus?

658
00:47:19,166 --> 00:47:21,377
MATT: You have nowhere to hide in this room,
unfortunately.

659
00:47:21,377 --> 00:47:22,949
LAURA: Even if it's super-duper dark?

660
00:47:22,949 --> 00:47:28,704
MATT: You get the idea that these creatures
probably aren't largely affected by the dark.

661
00:47:28,704 --> 00:47:32,854
LAURA: That makes perfect sense. I'm going to
Hunter's Mark the one that looks the strongest.

662
00:47:32,854 --> 00:47:39,384
MATT: Okay. The one that's most visible to you
would probably be this one going after your brother.

663
00:47:39,438 --> 00:47:41,086
You mark that one.

664
00:47:41,086 --> 00:47:47,491
LAURA: I am now going to attack him with my
blazing bow.

665
00:47:47,491 --> 00:47:53,329
MATT: All righty, go for it.

666
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:55,705
LAURA: All right. Natural 20!

667
00:47:55,705 --> 00:47:57,561
TRAVIS: Nice! Wyrmwood Box.

668
00:47:57,561 --> 00:47:59,417
TALIESIN: Breaking in the new box.

669
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:00,558
LAURA: That's right.

670
00:48:00,558 --> 00:48:02,578
LIAM: (sings) It's my dice in a box.

671
00:48:02,578 --> 00:48:05,772
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Dice in a box, yeah.

672
00:48:05,772 --> 00:48:16,675
LAURA: I add all of my dice together and then I
double it, and then I add the modifier? Okay. And

673
00:48:16,675 --> 00:48:18,080
I Hunter's Marked him, yeah.

674
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,729
MATT: Yes, you did.

675
00:48:19,729 --> 00:48:27,756
LAURA: 31.

676
00:48:27,756 --> 00:48:31,794
MATT: 31 definitely hits.

677
00:48:31,794 --> 00:48:37,065
LAURA: That's 31 damage.

678
00:48:37,065 --> 00:48:41,576
MATT: Oh, 31 damage. (laughs) Okay. All righty.

679
00:48:41,576 --> 00:48:49,670
LAURA: The second one was a three. It was a 14 to
hit.

680
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:55,508
MATT: No, unfortunately it dodges out of the way.
Its reflexes are very quick.

681
00:48:55,508 --> 00:48:58,487
LIAM: Be honest, the karma will come back to you.

682
00:48:58,487 --> 00:49:05,521
MATT: Right, so as you pull back, you release, and
with a flash of burning energy, your arrow ignites

683
00:49:05,521 --> 00:49:10,805
mid-transit. It blasts and bursts into the
vampiric creature, who hisses at you (snarls) through

684
00:49:10,805 --> 00:49:15,177
the dark. The second arrow, however, it's completely
ready for and actually manages to swipe it out of

685
00:49:15,221 --> 00:49:21,601
the air with its clawed hand. Okay, that ends your
turn. Next up is Vax.

686
00:49:21,601 --> 00:49:24,811
LIAM: All right, there is one vampire right in
front of me, right? The one who hurt me.

687
00:49:24,811 --> 00:49:25,784
MATT: Correct.

688
00:49:25,784 --> 00:49:34,254
LIAM: But I'm looking past his head at the one
next to Grog, the one that's got a blade down

689
00:49:34,254 --> 00:49:39,147
there on the map. No, the other one. Yeah, I think
I've got a pretty good shot at him. I'm going to

690
00:49:39,147 --> 00:49:43,134
ignore the vampire in front of me and since Grog
is right up against that guy, I'm going to sneak

691
00:49:43,134 --> 00:49:48,454
attack him and go (daggers flying) Oh no, first
I'm going to go click with my heels, and then I'm

692
00:49:48,454 --> 00:49:50,095
going to (daggers flying).

693
00:49:50,095 --> 00:49:52,282
MARISHA: Click, click. Dagger, dagger, dagger.

694
00:49:52,282 --> 00:49:54,554
MATT: Dagger, dagger, dagger! What you got?

695
00:49:54,554 --> 00:50:06,046
LIAM: It's all right. It's a 19. The second is a
28. And the third is a 21.

696
00:50:06,046 --> 00:50:06,897
MATT: Yep.

697
00:50:06,897 --> 00:50:07,997
LIAM: All three hit?

698
00:50:07,997 --> 00:50:09,217
MATT: Yeah, the first one was?

699
00:50:09,217 --> 00:50:10,501
LIAM: I don't remember.

700
00:50:10,501 --> 00:50:11,484
TALIESIN: 18.

701
00:50:11,484 --> 00:50:13,969
MATT: 18. Yeah. They all hit; not a problem.

702
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:21,660
LIAM: Okay, so the first one is the sneak attack,
and that one gets-- oh, I should be using the

703
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:31,205
Wyrmwood box. Eight plus 12, 15, 18, 25. 25 for
the first one. And for the second dagger that

704
00:50:31,205 --> 00:50:36,652
sinks into his head, that is eight. And for the
third one that sinks into his fanged fucking face,

705
00:50:36,652 --> 00:50:38,524
that is nine.

706
00:50:38,524 --> 00:50:44,980
MATT: All righty. Cool, so you click your Boots of
Haste. You feel the influx of adrenaline hit your

707
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:49,567
body, the magical push. You take the daggers and
(daggers flying) the vampire in front of you tries

708
00:50:49,567 --> 00:50:53,293
to swipe out of your hands, but you're too fast;
you've already released all three before he even

709
00:50:53,293 --> 00:50:58,214
gets to your wrist and pull back, grinning at it.
All three daggers (dagger impacts) repeatedly,

710
00:50:58,214 --> 00:51:03,872
hitting nearly the same point like an amazing
throwing of darts. Just smack, smack, smack into

711
00:51:03,872 --> 00:51:08,589
the center of the chest of the vampire across the
way. It's distracted by Grog; it doesn't

712
00:51:08,589 --> 00:51:13,637
see them coming until it is too late, and it
screeches out in pain (screeching) towards you.

713
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:22,769
The eyes help on this, huh? A nice and sizable
chunk of damage. All righty, that ends your turn,

714
00:51:22,769 --> 00:51:24,692
unless you want to try to move?

715
00:51:24,692 --> 00:51:30,583
LIAM: Yeah, actually I'm going to-- no. nope. I'm
good.

716
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:32,984
MATT: All right. Grog, you're up.

717
00:51:32,984 --> 00:51:35,814
TRAVIS: I would like to rage.

718
00:51:35,814 --> 00:51:38,953
(laughter)

719
00:51:38,953 --> 00:51:40,645
MATT: Please do.

720
00:51:40,645 --> 00:51:45,824
TRAVIS: And I would like to take my Firebrand
Warhammer and pound that shit to the left of me

721
00:51:45,824 --> 00:51:48,400
twice in the head with my fiery hammer.

722
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,762
MATT: All righty, go for it.

723
00:51:49,762 --> 00:51:54,781
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah. That is a 15.

724
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:57,101
MATT: 15 just barely hits.

725
00:51:57,101 --> 00:51:59,328
TRAVIS: And that's a one.

726
00:51:59,328 --> 00:52:03,110
LIAM: It's so hard to roleplay tonight.

727
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:05,360
TRAVIS: It's so difficult.

728
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,943
MARISHA: I'm Jimmy Falloning so hard over here.

729
00:52:07,943 --> 00:52:10,381
MATT: Yeah, you are. (chuckles)

730
00:52:10,381 --> 00:52:12,286
TRAVIS: 16.

731
00:52:12,286 --> 00:52:18,134
MATT: 16 on the first one. All right. That guy on
the left, the one that just got three daggers to

732
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:23,655
its chest. As the dagger vanishes from its wound,
it looks over at you, at your already big grin,

733
00:52:23,655 --> 00:52:29,084
mid-swing (wham). The warhammer blasts into its
chest, a burst of fire wreathing around its torso

734
00:52:29,084 --> 00:52:34,184
for a second. It gets pushed up against the wall.
This time, you go to swing with all your might on

735
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:38,266
your second blow, trying to smash it up against
the earth that you guys have carved this tunnel

736
00:52:38,266 --> 00:52:43,507
out of. It ducks out of the way in split-second
timing, and your hammer gets wedged into the

737
00:52:43,507 --> 00:52:45,973
side of the wall. Go ahead and make an athletics
check.

738
00:52:46,133 --> 00:52:48,162
LIAM: Pull that shit out.

739
00:52:48,162 --> 00:52:51,237
TRAVIS: Shit. Nine.

740
00:52:51,237 --> 00:52:53,909
MATT: Nine. It's pretty well wedged in there right
now.

741
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:55,410
LIAM: Next weapon.

742
00:52:55,410 --> 00:53:03,451
MATT: All right, so. Now this one's
going to shift over this way towards you, Percy.

743
00:53:03,451 --> 00:53:09,112
As you're on the ground prone still, just coming
to consciousness. He just (snarls) and lunges out

744
00:53:09,112 --> 00:53:17,946
towards you. This one's going to move here,
placing in that position, this one's going to stay

745
00:53:17,946 --> 00:53:26,222
there. All right, so the one rolling against you,
Grog. It still has you-- no, the one that had you

746
00:53:26,222 --> 00:53:30,472
grappled walked away towards Percy. The other
one's going to attempt to grapple you.

747
00:53:30,472 --> 00:53:32,309
That was 18?

748
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:33,282
TRAVIS: Misses.

749
00:53:33,282 --> 00:53:37,983
MATT: Misses. You slap aside with your hand as you
still try to pull the warhammer out of the wall,

750
00:53:37,983 --> 00:53:42,774
and then it gets clotheslined by the grip you have
on it. It's going to try to strike you with its

751
00:53:42,774 --> 00:53:47,007
claws for the second attack. That's a ten. Yeah,
no.

752
00:53:47,007 --> 00:53:48,325
TRAVIS: Misses.

753
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:52,744
MATT: You (swish) out of its way, laughing in its
face. The one against you, Percy, where you're on

754
00:53:52,744 --> 00:53:57,144
the ground prone. Oh okay, that'll be an 18?

755
00:53:57,144 --> 00:53:58,826
TALIESIN: I'm an 18.

756
00:53:58,826 --> 00:54:08,256
MATT: It grabs you by the front of your shit and
lifts you up with that hissing sound. Yeah,

757
00:54:08,256 --> 00:54:16,283
that'll be a 25. It pulls you in and sinks its
fangs into the side of your throat. You can feel

758
00:54:16,283 --> 00:54:21,555
yourself gasp out in pain as the cold sensation
pulses through your body, the actual life's blood

759
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:33,063
being drained from you. Okay, you take four points
of piercing damage, and you take eight points of

760
00:54:33,063 --> 00:54:37,497
necrotic damage, and your maximum hit points are
reduced by eight.

761
00:54:37,497 --> 00:54:41,284
TRAVIS: I forgot I have advantage on strength
checks when I'm raging.

762
00:54:41,284 --> 00:54:43,236
MATT: Roll again.

763
00:54:43,236 --> 00:54:45,720
TRAVIS: A one.

764
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,855
LAURA: Wow, really?

765
00:54:47,855 --> 00:54:50,398
TALIESIN: It's as if the gods defy you.

766
00:54:50,398 --> 00:54:57,449
MATT: So you're now grappled and held there. It's
pulling the blood out of your throat, you're

767
00:54:57,449 --> 00:55:03,873
caught off guard and completely just confused,
frightened, and in serious pain at this moment.

768
00:55:03,873 --> 00:55:09,352
All right, and the one that's Hunter's Marked,
that's against you. It's going to attempt to grab

769
00:55:09,352 --> 00:55:12,453
you. That's a 20?

770
00:55:12,453 --> 00:55:14,676
LIAM: Yeah, that works.

771
00:55:14,676 --> 00:55:22,321
MATT: Okay, no damage. It's just going to grab
you. And it goes in to attempt to go through

772
00:55:22,321 --> 00:55:26,207
your throat. You being prepared for this, having
been subjected to this once before, you bring a

773
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:29,807
dagger up towards its face and it just barely
manages to pull out of the way before you thrust

774
00:55:29,807 --> 00:55:36,023
it up through the bottom of its neck. You manage to
deflect the attack. All right, the people who just

775
00:55:36,068 --> 00:55:37,721
woke up, roll initiative, please.

776
00:55:37,721 --> 00:55:39,044
SAM: Initiative?

777
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:43,528
MATT: Which, for the record Scanlan, as a fan
mentioned to me this last week, your

778
00:55:43,528 --> 00:55:46,538
jack-of-all-trades ability as a bard that gives
you plus two to all things you're not proficient

779
00:55:46,538 --> 00:55:51,903
in also adds to your initiative, technically. So
you have a plus two to your initiative. I've had

780
00:55:51,903 --> 00:55:54,977
this brought up multiple times, if it's not true.

781
00:55:54,977 --> 00:56:00,456
SAM: I know it's been brought up to me. I thought
it was a hypothetical. Is it true?

782
00:56:00,456 --> 00:56:03,563
MATT: It's been clarified by a couple of
publications that have been sent to me when I

783
00:56:03,563 --> 00:56:04,515
questioned it.

784
00:56:04,515 --> 00:56:06,368
LIAM: What is the bonus for that hat?

785
00:56:06,368 --> 00:56:09,070
MATT: We'll consider that hat the plus two bonus.

786
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:15,073
SAM: (chuckles) So I get a plus two. I rolled a 20
initiative, then.

787
00:56:15,073 --> 00:56:18,934
MATT: Oh snap. Scanlan next to Vax. Nice.

788
00:56:18,934 --> 00:56:20,112
MARISHA: 12.

789
00:56:20,112 --> 00:56:22,943
MATT: 12. All right, Percy?

790
00:56:22,943 --> 00:56:24,196
TALIESIN: 22.

791
00:56:24,196 --> 00:56:25,266
MATT: Wow.

792
00:56:25,266 --> 00:56:27,052
TALIESIN: I have really good initiative.

793
00:56:27,052 --> 00:56:34,784
MATT: All right, so we are now at the top of the
round. This puts us to Vex and Percy going

794
00:56:34,818 --> 00:56:36,272
simultaneously.

795
00:56:36,272 --> 00:56:40,631
TALIESIN: I'll go first. I'm going to try and
break grapple, obviously, since that's what I have

796
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:41,567
to do.

797
00:56:41,567 --> 00:56:45,568
LAURA: Can I aid him by shooting him at the
same time as he is trying to break the grapple?

798
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:50,437
MATT: You know what? Yes, go ahead and roll your
first attack.

799
00:56:50,437 --> 00:56:55,887
LIAM: Go for the ear. It's a one.

800
00:56:55,887 --> 00:56:59,896
TRAVIS: You have the sage, still?

801
00:56:59,896 --> 00:57:01,943
TALIESIN: It's still at home.

802
00:57:01,943 --> 00:57:04,280
LAURA: It's been a lot of ones today, man.

803
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,943
MARISHA: It's only our first hour.

804
00:57:05,943 --> 00:57:11,515
MATT: Yeah, all right. So unfortunately, the first
arrow-- there is too much movement to the bodies.

805
00:57:11,515 --> 00:57:15,769
It doesn't strike true, so you do not have
advantage on this check. Acrobatics or athletics,

806
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:16,955
your choice.

807
00:57:16,955 --> 00:57:18,121
TALIESIN: Acrobatics!

808
00:57:18,121 --> 00:57:19,288
MATT: All righty.

809
00:57:19,288 --> 00:57:23,060
LIAM: Let's be clear, that was the shitty plastic
die, not the Wyrmwood Box.

810
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:24,132
TALIESIN: 28!

811
00:57:24,132 --> 00:57:25,745
MATT: 28. You manage to break the grapple.

812
00:57:25,745 --> 00:57:31,648
TALIESIN: So that's my action, but if I now
spend an action surge, I can get an action?

813
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:33,061
MATT: You can, yes.

814
00:57:33,061 --> 00:57:36,038
TALIESIN: Do I get three attacks with the sword I
just picked up? Since I'm too close to use my gun

815
00:57:36,038 --> 00:57:37,189
right now?

816
00:57:37,189 --> 00:57:38,335
MATT: Technically, yeah.

817
00:57:38,335 --> 00:57:43,587
TALIESIN: I'm going to draw the rapier that I just
picked and start stabbing at the terrible thing,

818
00:57:43,587 --> 00:57:46,307
all the while screaming. (screams)

819
00:57:46,307 --> 00:57:47,477
MATT: All right, go for it.

820
00:57:47,477 --> 00:57:50,102
(laughter)

821
00:57:50,102 --> 00:57:54,461
LAURA: Is your little butt flap down? Are you in
the long johns?

822
00:57:54,461 --> 00:57:58,637
TALIESIN: The butt flap of my soul is down. I'm
well-dressed at the moment.

823
00:57:58,637 --> 00:58:05,774
MATT: It's a plus-one rapier. But your archery you
took, I think was your combat?

824
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:07,842
TALIESIN: Yes, so I get a negative two to attack.

825
00:58:07,842 --> 00:58:10,980
MATT: Correct, to what you normally get. So you
have a overall plus one.

826
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:14,932
TALIESIN: So I get a plus one to attack, on top of
my--

827
00:58:14,932 --> 00:58:19,519
MATT: No, sorry. Minus one is the total from what
you get for your pistols, for your Pepperbox.

828
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:21,796
TALIESIN: Minus one, not minus two. Got it.

829
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:23,549
MATT: The magical rapier offsets that a bit.

830
00:58:23,549 --> 00:58:26,742
TALIESIN: That's 25.

831
00:58:26,824 --> 00:58:28,462
MATT: 25 hits.

832
00:58:28,462 --> 00:58:32,674
TALIESIN: That's a one. Misses.

833
00:58:32,674 --> 00:58:35,410
MATT: Go ahead and roll a third time.

834
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:39,353
TALIESIN: And that's a 14.

835
00:58:39,353 --> 00:58:47,292
MATT: Okay, so the first strike sinks true. That's
1d8 plus what's your strength modifier? Well, no

836
00:58:47,292 --> 00:58:48,358
it would be dex.

837
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:52,026
TALIESIN: Dex, thank you! So that's 1d8 plus dex.

838
00:58:52,026 --> 00:58:55,328
MATT: Plus one damage on top of that because it's
a plus-one weapon.

839
00:58:55,328 --> 00:58:57,745
TALIESIN: That's a nine.

840
00:58:57,745 --> 00:59:04,802
MATT: Nine damage. All right. So your first swing,
the speed of your ability to break this grapple

841
00:59:04,802 --> 00:59:09,250
and then immediately pull this weapon and jam it
forward. It pierces part of the body and pull out,

842
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:13,359
the creature all of a sudden reaches over and
grabs its side instinctually. You go for two more

843
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:18,986
strikes; however, being the first time in a long
time that you've ever held a rapier and still with

844
00:59:18,986 --> 00:59:24,683
your other hand holding your throat in
severe pain, it flings forward twice. The second

845
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:28,731
time, the creature actually grabs it and pulls you
in towards it.

846
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:29,886
TALIESIN: (yells)

847
00:59:29,886 --> 00:59:31,954
MARISHA: What?

848
00:59:31,954 --> 00:59:36,928
MATT: So yeah. You're now considered re-grappled.

849
00:59:36,928 --> 00:59:38,279
TALIESIN: (yells)

850
00:59:38,279 --> 00:59:43,552
MATT: So you can take another attack.

851
00:59:43,552 --> 00:59:50,094
LAURA: I'll do my second arrow and try to hit him
again because I don't like that I missed.

852
00:59:50,138 --> 00:59:51,434
TRAVIS: Fucking hit him this time, will you?

853
00:59:51,434 --> 00:59:53,697
LAURA: I know, right? Don't suck so hard, me.

854
00:59:53,697 --> 00:59:56,175
LIAM: Come on, don't do that again. You're my
sister.

855
00:59:56,175 --> 01:00:01,978
LAURA: That's better. That definitely hits. It was
an 18 plus--

856
01:00:01,978 --> 01:00:07,605
MATT: Oh, 18 plus stuff? Yeah. Go ahead and roll
damage. This is against the one that's on Percy,

857
01:00:07,605 --> 01:00:10,305
still, or the one that's against your brother?

858
01:00:10,305 --> 01:00:13,175
LAURA: I said it was the one against Percy, even
though the other one is Hunter's Marked.

859
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,984
TALIESIN: Don't sound so upset about it.

860
01:00:14,984 --> 01:00:16,553
LAURA: Well, I'm just saying.

861
01:00:16,553 --> 01:00:17,752
MATT: Too late.

862
01:00:17,752 --> 01:00:20,794
LAURA: Yes! 16.

863
01:00:20,794 --> 01:00:27,573
MATT: 16, all right. This arrow, however, does
manage to sink into its side. It protrudes about

864
01:00:27,623 --> 01:00:30,955
four inches from its body; it's pretty deep into its
torso, breaking a couple of ribs, but you see

865
01:00:30,955 --> 01:00:39,114
the creature, being the undead nature of its physicality, it's
not looking too great, but it's not at the end of

866
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:44,225
its rope right now. All right, that ends that.
Scanlan, you're up.

867
01:00:44,225 --> 01:00:48,723
SAM: Okay, so there's three of these things?

868
01:00:48,723 --> 01:00:50,292
MATT: There are three of them, yes.

869
01:00:50,292 --> 01:00:54,742
SAM: Okay, I'm going to use my movement-- can I
see them all?

870
01:00:54,742 --> 01:00:56,274
MATT: You can currently, yes.

871
01:00:56,274 --> 01:01:05,582
SAM: I'll use my movement, because I just woke up, to
pee. Because I just woke up, I've got to pee.

872
01:01:05,582 --> 01:01:08,021
TRAVIS: Do you have morning--

873
01:01:08,021 --> 01:01:11,594
SAM: It's midnight wood.

874
01:01:11,594 --> 01:01:15,161
TRAVIS: Okay, so it's probably going to go
everywhere.

875
01:01:15,161 --> 01:01:17,394
LIAM: You're acting like you're botoxed.

876
01:01:17,394 --> 01:01:19,543
SAM: I can't move my lips.

877
01:01:19,543 --> 01:01:24,503
MATT: So Scanlan, you use your movement to pee.

878
01:01:24,503 --> 01:01:39,798
SAM: While I'm peeing, I whip out my Wand of Magic
Missiles and I point it, and I use four of the

879
01:01:39,798 --> 01:01:47,520
slots for it to shoot... four times three is 12 missiles.

880
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,540
MATT: Can you do that?

881
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:55,419
SAM: Each slot is one Magic Missile spell, which
is three missiles.

882
01:01:55,451 --> 01:01:59,925
MATT: I don't know if you can use multiple slots
on a turn, can you?

883
01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:07,040
SAM: It says so on the wand. "For one charge, you
cast the 1st-level spell. You can increase the

884
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:13,572
"spell slot level for each additional charge you
spend." So I'm going to use four of them.

885
01:02:13,572 --> 01:02:15,802
TRAVIS: Like a battleship.

886
01:02:15,802 --> 01:02:17,989
MARISHA: Like a level-4 magic missile.

887
01:02:17,989 --> 01:02:23,141
SAM: Which is 4d4 plus four for each one that I
hit.

888
01:02:23,141 --> 01:02:24,838
TALIESIN: Like a Rhinestone cowboy.

889
01:02:24,838 --> 01:02:26,318
LIAM: It's the mustache.

890
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:30,553
TRAVIS, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: (sing) Rhinestone
cowboy.

891
01:02:30,553 --> 01:02:33,536
LAURA: Burt Reynolds should play with us more
often.

892
01:02:33,536 --> 01:02:38,013
TRAVIS: He has the best old man laugh right now.

893
01:02:38,013 --> 01:02:40,492
SAM: This guy is the brains of the operation.

894
01:02:40,492 --> 01:02:47,710
LIAM: Let me break the fourth wall just for a
second to say that this game is totally fucked.

895
01:02:47,758 --> 01:02:54,033
MATT: It creates an additional dart per spell
level, so it's initially three, and it's three

896
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:55,865
levels higher, it gets to six.

897
01:02:55,865 --> 01:03:00,251
SAM: Oh, so it doesn't increase it three darts per
level. It's one. So if I do a level four, I get

898
01:03:00,431 --> 01:03:02,232
two darts for each fucker.

899
01:03:02,232 --> 01:03:04,671
MATT: Essentially, yeah. I'd be 6d4 plus six.

900
01:03:04,671 --> 01:03:10,474
SAM: 6d4 plus six. Okay, so 2d4 plus two for each
guy. I'll do that.

901
01:03:10,474 --> 01:03:13,096
MATT: And they hit automatically. There is no roll
for it.

902
01:03:13,096 --> 01:03:16,584
SAM: Great. And it can't hit my friends or
anything, right? I mean, they're Magic Missiles.

903
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:19,705
MATT: No, they unerringly hit. They're like homing
arcane projectiles.

904
01:03:19,705 --> 01:03:21,714
SAM: Do I have to roll this six times or just
two?

905
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,377
MATT: Six times. I know.

906
01:03:23,377 --> 01:03:30,241
SAM: So, three plus two for the first guy.

907
01:03:30,241 --> 01:03:32,045
MATT: Okay, so five against him.

908
01:03:32,045 --> 01:03:35,530
SAM: Ten for the second guy.

909
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:36,778
MATT: All righty.

910
01:03:36,778 --> 01:03:41,517
SAM: And seven for the third guy.

911
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:44,237
MATT: All righty. So as you get up--

912
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:50,060
SAM: By the way, I'm holding my dick with one hand
and the wand with the other. I'm dual wielding.

913
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:52,475
MARISHA: Dual wielding! Are you proficient in
that?

914
01:03:52,475 --> 01:03:57,817
MATT: I think Scanlan is pretty proficient in
this. I'm just saying. All right, so.

915
01:03:57,817 --> 01:04:00,217
SAM: And they're both spraying everywhere.

916
01:04:00,217 --> 01:04:03,325
MATT: Happy Halloween!

917
01:04:03,325 --> 01:04:05,786
TRAVIS: Are you writing your name with your left
hand?

918
01:04:05,786 --> 01:04:15,734
MATT: Okay, so. As you sign your signature on the
ground, you also burst forth with a series of

919
01:04:15,734 --> 01:04:21,022
arcane bolts that streak across the room, slamming
into the sides of each of these vampires. They all

920
01:04:21,022 --> 01:04:26,674
look towards you as a reaction to the pain, and
their heads all turn curiously as to what they

921
01:04:26,674 --> 01:04:29,515
see. Not what they were expecting.

922
01:04:29,515 --> 01:04:31,769
SAM: Don't worry, I won't wash my hands.

923
01:04:31,769 --> 01:04:34,235
(laughter)

924
01:04:34,235 --> 01:04:37,314
MATT: All right, that's your movement and your
action. I think that's your turn, right?

925
01:04:37,314 --> 01:04:38,663
SAM: Do I get a bonus?

926
01:04:38,663 --> 01:04:39,737
MATT: If you want to use one, yeah.

927
01:04:39,737 --> 01:04:48,670
SAM: Sure, so I'll inspire Grog. (sings) I need
Grog to rage and get us through this semi-fucked

928
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:50,768
kind of fight, baby, baby.

929
01:04:50,768 --> 01:04:54,277
(laughter)

930
01:04:54,277 --> 01:04:57,873
TRAVIS: Wow, way back.

931
01:04:57,912 --> 01:05:00,426
SAM: (sings) Kill-kill-kill kill-kill-kill-kill!

932
01:05:00,426 --> 01:05:04,107
ALL: (sing) Kill-kill-kill kill-kill-kill-kill!

933
01:05:04,107 --> 01:05:06,485
(laughter)

934
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:08,754
MATT: All right. Take your d10 inspiration die,
Grog.

935
01:05:08,754 --> 01:05:12,553
Oh man, I get a d10 inspiration for that.

936
01:05:12,553 --> 01:05:15,105
LIAM: Oh, that's so Ravenloft.

937
01:05:15,138 --> 01:05:17,666
(laughter)

938
01:05:17,666 --> 01:05:19,411
TALIESIN: Wow!

939
01:05:19,411 --> 01:05:21,313
MATT: Good night, everybody! And we're done.

940
01:05:21,313 --> 01:05:22,795
SAM: Take the inspiration back.

941
01:05:22,795 --> 01:05:26,684
MATT: All right. Vax, you're up.

942
01:05:26,684 --> 01:05:29,788
LIAM: No, I'm not. I'm going to hold for a turn.

943
01:05:29,788 --> 01:05:31,388
LAURA: Are you really?

944
01:05:31,388 --> 01:05:35,228
MATT: All right, Vax is now going after Grog.
Right. Grog, you're up.

945
01:05:35,228 --> 01:05:39,048
TRAVIS: I want to hammer in the morning, and I
want to pull my hammer out of the wall.

946
01:05:39,048 --> 01:05:42,795
MATT: Okay, you can use one of your attacks to. Go
ahead and make an athletics check.

947
01:05:42,795 --> 01:05:47,517
TRAVIS: Yay, that's better. That's a 28.

948
01:05:47,517 --> 01:05:51,420
MATT: Yeah you (sucking noise) pull your hammer
out without an issue. You're embarrassed at the

949
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:55,040
fact that it was even embedded in what is
essentially hard earth, and you still couldn't

950
01:05:55,040 --> 01:06:00,146
pull it free. But now it's blazing with flames;
it's tight in your grasp. What are you going to

951
01:06:00,146 --> 01:06:01,228
follow it up with?

952
01:06:01,228 --> 01:06:07,718
TRAVIS: Can I use the great weapon master on these
attacks, and I'll use reckless attack for

953
01:06:07,718 --> 01:06:11,255
advantage on them, and anybody that attacks me
gets advantage, as well?

954
01:06:11,255 --> 01:06:12,643
MATT: Okay. Yes, you can.

955
01:06:12,676 --> 01:06:16,798
TRAVIS: Thank god. 21.

956
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:18,142
MATT: 21 hits.

957
01:06:18,142 --> 01:06:24,560
TRAVIS: Beautiful, and the second one. That's
landed on the side. That's 24.

958
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:27,486
MATT: Yep, both hit. Go ahead and roll damage plus
ten to each.

959
01:06:27,486 --> 01:06:29,055
TRAVIS: (sings) Yeah, nipples.

960
01:06:29,055 --> 01:06:32,424
MATT: To which one, the one that's next to Percy
or the one that's in front of you here?

961
01:06:32,424 --> 01:06:33,523
TRAVIS: The one that's next to me!

962
01:06:33,523 --> 01:06:34,539
MATT: All righty.

963
01:06:34,539 --> 01:06:38,427
TRAVIS: 14 and 15, so 25 for the first one.

964
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:39,931
MATT: All right.

965
01:06:39,931 --> 01:06:41,164
TRAVIS: (sings) Stanky.

966
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:43,364
(giggling)

967
01:06:43,364 --> 01:06:44,668
SAM: Did you just say stanky?

968
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:46,196
LAURA: Yeah, he did.

969
01:06:46,196 --> 01:06:49,690
LIAM: There is no difference between our old home
game and this.

970
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:53,319
SAM: Except we don't have air conditioning.

971
01:06:53,319 --> 01:06:54,509
TRAVIS: 29.

972
01:06:54,509 --> 01:06:59,675
MATT: 29 damage, jeez. So, the one that's
harassing you. Chuckling at the fact that you've

973
01:06:59,675 --> 01:07:04,977
currently been unable to really prove your might
as a goliath in front of these individuals, you

974
01:07:04,977 --> 01:07:11,618
grin as you pull it back and (wham) slam it
directly in the face of it. It rears back,

975
01:07:11,618 --> 01:07:16,380
(growls) confused for a second. You can see a
crack in its jaw and blood beginning to trickle down

976
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:22,714
its jaw. You pull back and slam it a second time,
this time with a resounding crack sound, as part

977
01:07:22,714 --> 01:07:28,418
of its jaw is dislodged and set to the side, its
tongue dangling out, and dark black blood begins

978
01:07:28,418 --> 01:07:34,214
to pour from the center of its mouth as it looks
to you with absolute fear. That was pretty rough.

979
01:07:34,214 --> 01:07:35,207
TRAVIS: Yeah!

980
01:07:35,207 --> 01:07:37,161
MATT: All righty, you want to do anything with
your movement?

981
01:07:37,161 --> 01:07:38,233
TRAVIS: Nope.

982
01:07:38,233 --> 01:07:39,315
MATT: All right.

983
01:07:39,315 --> 01:07:42,618
TRAVIS: Actually, I'll put my back against the
wall.

984
01:07:42,618 --> 01:07:43,868
MATT: This one?

985
01:07:43,868 --> 01:07:48,699
TRAVIS: Yes. To open it up in case somebody wants
to take a shot at him.

986
01:07:48,699 --> 01:07:52,753
MATT: Okay. It will get an attack of opportunity
on you. Are you cool with that?

987
01:07:52,753 --> 01:07:53,877
TRAVIS: Yes.

988
01:07:53,877 --> 01:07:58,781
MATT: All right. With advantage because reckless
attack. That is a 22.

989
01:07:58,781 --> 01:07:59,948
TRAVIS: That hits.

990
01:07:59,948 --> 01:08:09,936
MATT: All right. You are raging, so you take ten
points, so now five points of slashing damage.

991
01:08:09,936 --> 01:08:11,159
TRAVIS: Okay.

992
01:08:11,159 --> 01:08:17,219
MATT: All righty. That brings us to Vax. Now it is
your turn.

993
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:21,348
LIAM: Right, yeah, I'm good now. So the vampire is
still in front of me, right? I give him a look

994
01:08:21,348 --> 01:08:26,537
like, yeah, go fuck yourself, and then I keep
throwing at the other guy who's with

995
01:08:26,537 --> 01:08:27,778
Grog still, right?

996
01:08:27,778 --> 01:08:29,209
MATT: No, Grog moved away.

997
01:08:29,209 --> 01:08:34,193
LIAM: All right, then I'll handle the guy up
front. I'm going to go for his guts. I'm going to

998
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:43,650
go low. One, two, three right in his guts. First
attack. Hit, way hits; that's a 30. And the second

999
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:49,306
attack is a 24, and the third attack is a 17.

1000
01:08:49,306 --> 01:08:51,319
MATT: All right. So those all hit.

1001
01:08:51,319 --> 01:09:01,834
LIAM: Okay, they do. That's 11 for the first and
eight for the second and eight for the third.

1002
01:09:01,834 --> 01:09:04,049
Right in his vampire guts.

1003
01:09:04,049 --> 01:09:08,093
MATT: (dagger impacts) You jam the dagger into its
torso. It's trying to stop and slap the hands

1004
01:09:08,093 --> 01:09:11,383
away, but you're too fast and the final hit, you
push it up, and you're right in its face again;

1005
01:09:11,383 --> 01:09:15,835
you can see its fangs still wet with the blood
that it pulled from your throat, and you grin at

1006
01:09:15,835 --> 01:09:19,313
it back as you withdraw the dagger with much force and
anger.

1007
01:09:19,313 --> 01:09:23,375
LIAM: And the last thing I say is, vampires ain't
shit.

1008
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:25,472
(laughter)

1009
01:09:25,472 --> 01:09:31,415
MATT: Getting that on a jacket now. Vampires ain't
shit. All right, cool. That ends your turn, unless

1010
01:09:31,415 --> 01:09:33,007
you want to move or do anything else?

1011
01:09:33,007 --> 01:09:34,053
LIAM: Nah.

1012
01:09:34,053 --> 01:09:39,097
MATT: All right. Now it's their turn. You notice,
by the way: this round, specifically, as they're

1013
01:09:39,097 --> 01:09:44,352
looking a little more wounded, their flesh begins
to slowly reform. The wounds they've taken begin

1014
01:09:44,352 --> 01:09:49,182
to seal up and the pouring of blood begins to
slowly turn into a trickle.

1015
01:09:49,182 --> 01:09:51,360
LIAM: So what? So does Scanlan's mustache.

1016
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:52,726
MATT: It's true.

1017
01:09:52,726 --> 01:09:56,230
SAM: I would smile right now if I could.

1018
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:58,114
(laughter)

1019
01:09:58,114 --> 01:10:00,853
TALIESIN: I want to tickle you. See what happens.

1020
01:10:00,853 --> 01:10:03,041
MATT: All righty. This one's going to move up to
here.

1021
01:10:03,041 --> 01:10:08,622
MARISHA: Did I just get seriously boned in
initiative? Am I still sleeping?

1022
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:13,577
MATT: Yeah, you're last. I mean, you'll be getting
up this turn.

1023
01:10:13,577 --> 01:10:15,009
MARISHA: I'm still asleep, guys.

1024
01:10:15,009 --> 01:10:16,863
MATT: Well, you're awake. You woke up, you're just
prone.

1025
01:10:16,863 --> 01:10:18,738
MARISHA: Well, I'm real groggy.

1026
01:10:18,738 --> 01:10:22,366
MATT: Real Grog-gy. Sorry, I'm so sorry.

1027
01:10:22,366 --> 01:10:23,819
TALIESIN: It's never going to stop being funny.

1028
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:26,735
SAM: You're so attractive tonight for some reason.
Have we been together?

1029
01:10:26,735 --> 01:10:31,773
TRAVIS: What? Oh, you and I have been together. Did
you see?

1030
01:10:31,773 --> 01:10:33,154
SAM: Look at that.

1031
01:10:33,154 --> 01:10:37,640
TRAVIS: I carved that in with a pen, myself, after
our night together.

1032
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:40,131
Where have you been my whole life?

1033
01:10:40,131 --> 01:10:42,013
MATT: It's canon.

1034
01:10:42,013 --> 01:10:47,143
(laughter)

1035
01:10:47,143 --> 01:10:52,084
LIAM: This is our least serious episode ever. We
cannot wear costumes but once a year.

1036
01:10:52,084 --> 01:10:54,122
MATT: Yeah. Only time that it works.

1037
01:10:54,255 --> 01:10:56,174
SAM: And Purim, also.

1038
01:10:56,174 --> 01:10:58,500
TALIESIN: There will be a pajama night for
Christmas.

1039
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,872
ALL: Yeah.

1040
01:10:59,872 --> 01:11:03,271
MATT: Speaking of which. Percy, it's your turn.
Oh, I'm sorry, it's their turn on you. There's two

1041
01:11:03,271 --> 01:11:06,618
of them now, ganging up on you. Natural 20.

1042
01:11:06,618 --> 01:11:08,357
MARISHA: How many's left? Three?

1043
01:11:08,357 --> 01:11:12,009
LIAM: They're all still here. They're taking hits.

1044
01:11:12,009 --> 01:11:16,055
MATT: That's a 20 and a 15.

1045
01:11:16,102 --> 01:11:18,183
TALIESIN: The 20 hits. The 15 does not.

1046
01:11:18,183 --> 01:11:28,068
MATT: All right. Well, you take 14 points of
slashing damage from the claw. The second attack,

1047
01:11:28,068 --> 01:11:32,466
it attempts to slash you a second time. You manage
to dodge out of the way, putting your back up

1048
01:11:32,466 --> 01:11:36,323
against the wall to barely avoid its grasp.
However, the second one lunges towards you,

1049
01:11:36,323 --> 01:11:39,372
attempting to grab you. That is a 19?

1050
01:11:39,372 --> 01:11:40,954
TALIESIN: 19 hits.

1051
01:11:40,954 --> 01:11:45,528
MATT: 19 hits. No damage, but now it's grabbed you
and shoved you up against the wall. It takes one

1052
01:11:45,528 --> 01:11:52,730
hand and jams it up under your chin to push your
head up and goes for your throat. Rolls a one. As

1053
01:11:52,730 --> 01:12:00,673
it goes to bite your throat, you pull Pepperbox up
and jam it into its mouth. It (choking). It has to

1054
01:12:00,673 --> 01:12:05,108
pull back from the attack, and you can see now
this vampire saliva is all over the barrel of the

1055
01:12:05,108 --> 01:12:13,151
gun, and it may have chipped a tooth. All right,
that finishes their turn. Keyleth, you're up.

1056
01:12:13,151 --> 01:12:16,735
MARISHA: Whoa!

1057
01:12:16,735 --> 01:12:18,302
SAM: Not a dream.

1058
01:12:18,302 --> 01:12:20,909
MARISHA: Okay, I thought it was for a second.

1059
01:12:20,909 --> 01:12:22,226
LIAM: Real vampires.

1060
01:12:22,226 --> 01:12:28,434
MARISHA: Okay! What's the situation with the
vampires? That's all of them clustered there?

1061
01:12:28,434 --> 01:12:31,181
MATT: There's two of them right there on Percy.
They have him grabbed and shoved against the wall.

1062
01:12:31,181 --> 01:12:34,334
There's one over here that's battling back and
forth with Vax.

1063
01:12:34,334 --> 01:12:38,536
MARISHA: Vax? Where is Percy?

1064
01:12:38,536 --> 01:12:40,349
TALIESIN: Against the wall.

1065
01:12:40,349 --> 01:12:48,603
MARISHA: You're against the wall. I get up. Can I
reach around Scanlan,

1066
01:12:48,603 --> 01:12:51,384
doing another reach around--

1067
01:12:51,384 --> 01:12:54,753
SAM: You're doing a reach-around? Okay. My dick is
out.

1068
01:12:54,753 --> 01:13:01,674
MARISHA: And I see as I reach around. I'm like,
aw, really? And I'm blasting--

1069
01:13:01,674 --> 01:13:04,511
SAM: Little privacy, please?

1070
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:09,841
MARISHA: I'm blasting a Sunbeam.

1071
01:13:09,971 --> 01:13:12,076
MATT: At which one?

1072
01:13:12,135 --> 01:13:14,484
MARISHA: Those two. It's a line. Are they in a
line?

1073
01:13:14,484 --> 01:13:16,647
MATT: You're probably going to have to move to get
them both in a line.

1074
01:13:16,647 --> 01:13:18,268
MARISHA: Can I shift to where I can?

1075
01:13:18,268 --> 01:13:19,904
MATT: You can move there to do it, yes.

1076
01:13:19,904 --> 01:13:20,877
MARISHA: That's what I want to do.

1077
01:13:20,877 --> 01:13:22,988
MATT: Okay, so you slide alongside Scanlan--

1078
01:13:22,988 --> 01:13:26,912
MARISHA: And I yell to the party: Shield your
eyes!

1079
01:13:26,912 --> 01:13:30,380
SAM: I instinctively cover my penis.

1080
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:33,601
(laughter)

1081
01:13:33,601 --> 01:13:35,075
LIAM: Oh my goodness.

1082
01:13:35,075 --> 01:13:37,677
SAM: It's more important than my eyes.

1083
01:13:37,677 --> 01:13:42,490
TRAVIS: Take my eyes, not my penis.

1084
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:44,708
LIAM: It's the third one.

1085
01:13:44,708 --> 01:13:52,679
MATT: Yeah, no, you were technically in melee with
this guy, but there is no attack roll, so you

1086
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:54,563
don't have disadvantage, which is good.

1087
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:55,429
MARISHA: Awesome.

1088
01:13:55,429 --> 01:13:56,432
MATT: All right, so.

1089
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,544
MARISHA: I roll a bunch of d6s?

1090
01:13:57,544 --> 01:14:00,367
MATT: Well, yeah, go ahead and do that. Each
creature has to make a constitution saving throw.

1091
01:14:00,367 --> 01:14:02,272
MARISHA: How many d6s do I roll?

1092
01:14:02,272 --> 01:14:08,340
MATT: It's 6d8 radiant damage, and they have
disadvantage on the saving throw because they are

1093
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:22,464
undead. So the first one-- that is a 14, nope.
Second one, no. Third one-- no, rolled a one. All

1094
01:14:22,464 --> 01:14:24,351
right, so all of them take full damage.

1095
01:14:24,351 --> 01:14:42,121
MARISHA: Full damage. Okay, so that is 15, 19. Not
bad. 21 plus 12, so that's 33 radiant damage, and

1096
01:14:42,121 --> 01:14:43,605
they are blinded.

1097
01:14:43,605 --> 01:14:46,350
SAM: What? Is that true?

1098
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:51,682
MATT: Okay, well. (chuckles)

1099
01:14:51,718 --> 01:14:59,018
SAM: (singing) Let the sun shine, let the sunshine
in.

1100
01:14:59,073 --> 01:15:05,256
MATT: So both of these vampires currently have
Percy pinned up against the wall. One of them is

1101
01:15:05,256 --> 01:15:08,690
trying to bite his throat, and Percy's trying to
keep it at bay with his weapons. Keyleth, you step

1102
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:09,730
forward--

1103
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:13,500
MARISHA: Where I can also not look at Scanlan's
penis.

1104
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:21,706
MATT: Right, you feel the inspiration, based on
the presence of the Sun Tree, and what previously

1105
01:15:21,706 --> 01:15:27,489
you were attempting to try and repair it with.
Using that, you close your eyes and a burst of

1106
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:33,016
sunlight energy cascades forth, slamming into both
the vampires and barely missing Percy in the

1107
01:15:33,016 --> 01:15:37,333
process. Both of them look over out of the corner
of their eye as they see the flash of light. They

1108
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:43,418
both scream out (screeches) as the blast shoots
through both of them. Both of them immediately

1109
01:15:43,479 --> 01:15:46,950
turn to ash and are strewn against the far wall.

1110
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:48,799
TRAVIS: Whoa! Damn!

1111
01:15:48,799 --> 01:15:50,409
SAM: That was so cool.

1112
01:15:50,409 --> 01:15:52,060
MARISHA: That was cool.

1113
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:53,574
SAM: Zip.

1114
01:15:53,574 --> 01:15:55,839
TRAVIS: Bonus action.

1115
01:15:55,839 --> 01:15:57,398
MARISHA: So there is one alive?

1116
01:15:57,398 --> 01:15:59,157
MATT: There is one alive, yes, that's right next
to you.

1117
01:15:59,157 --> 01:16:00,416
MARISHA: And he's on Vax?

1118
01:16:00,416 --> 01:16:01,399
MATT: Currently, yes.

1119
01:16:01,399 --> 01:16:07,985
MARISHA: Okay, I see that. I turn and I see him,
and I'm gonna take a Grasping Vine and wrap around it and

1120
01:16:08,032 --> 01:16:11,931
yank him, trying to beat him up against the wall
on the other side.

1121
01:16:11,931 --> 01:16:13,145
MATT: This side here?

1122
01:16:13,145 --> 01:16:13,892
MARISHA: Yep.

1123
01:16:13,892 --> 01:16:14,944
MATT: Okay, is it a bonus action for Grasping Vine?

1124
01:16:14,978 --> 01:16:16,208
MARISHA: Yes, it is.

1125
01:16:16,208 --> 01:16:19,028
MATT: What's the roll for that? I'm looking for
the roll for Grasping Vine real fast.

1126
01:16:19,028 --> 01:16:29,286
MARISHA: I conjure a vine-- I think it just
happens.

1127
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:35,928
MATT: Dexterity saving throw. With the DC, it's
17.

1128
01:16:35,928 --> 01:16:37,402
MARISHA: Nope, 18.

1129
01:16:37,402 --> 01:16:39,095
MATT: 18. No, that gets it.

1130
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:51,918
MATT: Damn, all right. So. It pulls it (impact
sound) into the wall over that way, the vines now

1131
01:16:51,918 --> 01:16:54,435
currently wrapped around its torso. It tries to
pull itself free.

1132
01:16:54,435 --> 01:16:57,500
LAURA: We should probably use sunlight on them
always, because don't they turn into mist if we

1133
01:16:57,546 --> 01:16:59,084
don't kill them?

1134
01:16:59,084 --> 01:17:00,457
MARISHA: Yeah, I think so.

1135
01:17:00,457 --> 01:17:03,610
MATT: All right. That brings us to the top of the
round. Vex and Percy, it's your go.

1136
01:17:03,610 --> 01:17:09,616
LAURA: I don't know, should we attack him or
should we let--

1137
01:17:09,616 --> 01:17:10,998
TRAVIS: Stake.

1138
01:17:10,998 --> 01:17:16,104
LAURA: Oh yeah. I bust out one of the wooden
daggers. I walk up and I try to stab it into his

1139
01:17:16,104 --> 01:17:17,832
heart. In front of my brother.

1140
01:17:17,832 --> 01:17:20,388
MARISHA: Nice! Wood dagger!

1141
01:17:20,388 --> 01:17:23,993
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for a melee
attack.

1142
01:17:24,036 --> 01:17:26,779
LAURA: Okay, I still get two attacks, right?

1143
01:17:26,779 --> 01:17:32,269
MATT: Correct. And you're using your dexterity as
the bonus. Simple weapon,

1144
01:17:32,269 --> 01:17:33,855
which you're proficient with.

1145
01:17:33,855 --> 01:17:34,986
LAURA: 19?

1146
01:17:34,986 --> 01:17:37,687
MATT: That is a 19? Does hit, yes.

1147
01:17:37,687 --> 01:17:39,373
LAURA: Okay, then what do I do?

1148
01:17:39,373 --> 01:17:40,980
MATT: Roll for second attack.

1149
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:46,888
LAURA: Probably no. 14.

1150
01:17:46,888 --> 01:17:55,486
MATT: 14 does not hit. All right, so go ahead and
roll 1d4. Add your dex modifier.

1151
01:17:55,486 --> 01:18:00,625
LAURA: Nine?

1152
01:18:00,625 --> 01:18:07,670
MATT: All right, so you take the heavily-sharpened
wooden dagger, essentially. You jam it into its

1153
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:15,917
chest. It screeches out in pain, the wooden stake
itself partially destroyed in the process of

1154
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:20,453
jamming it in to do so much damage. It reaches up
grabs it and breaks it off, and part of it still

1155
01:18:20,453 --> 01:18:23,158
in its chest, goes (growling hiss). Hisses at you
angrily.

1156
01:18:23,158 --> 01:18:27,210
LAURA: Wooden stakes don't work! I back up a
little bit.

1157
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:34,335
SAM: You got some damage in, no? Yes?

1158
01:18:34,386 --> 01:18:38,174
That stake was well done. Yeah!

1159
01:18:38,174 --> 01:18:41,069
(laughter)

1160
01:18:41,069 --> 01:18:44,051
TRAVIS: That was so CSI Miami, man.

1161
01:18:44,051 --> 01:18:48,946
LIAM: Your mustache is almost down to your chin
for a goatee.

1162
01:18:48,946 --> 01:18:51,858
SAM: Soon it will be creeping across my face.

1163
01:18:51,858 --> 01:18:57,058
MATT: All right, that ends your turn?

1164
01:18:57,092 --> 01:18:58,329
LAURA: I guess so.

1165
01:18:58,329 --> 01:18:59,564
MATT: Yeah, that was two attacks.

1166
01:18:59,564 --> 01:19:01,164
LAURA: Can I move away, since he's grappled?

1167
01:19:01,164 --> 01:19:06,373
MATT: Well, he's not currently grappled per se;
he's just held against the wall. You can still

1168
01:19:06,373 --> 01:19:10,895
move away if you want. It'll just take a swipe at you.

1169
01:19:10,895 --> 01:19:13,557
LAURA: I'm going to stay right there.

1170
01:19:13,632 --> 01:19:17,440
MATT: Okay. Trinket is cheering you on (bear
noises) from the back wall.

1171
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:18,995
LAURA: Thanks, Trinket.

1172
01:19:18,995 --> 01:19:21,578
MATT: Percy.

1173
01:19:21,578 --> 01:19:25,613
TALIESIN: Is it true that we can't kill it except
with sunlight?

1174
01:19:25,613 --> 01:19:27,017
LAURA: Sunlight and water.

1175
01:19:27,017 --> 01:19:32,668
MATT: You're not entirely certain. You know that
sunlight is very damaging to it, and from your

1176
01:19:32,668 --> 01:19:39,277
research, you know that vampires of certain levels
of power, as opposed to dying, turn into a mist

1177
01:19:39,277 --> 01:19:41,966
form and attempt to retreat.

1178
01:19:41,966 --> 01:19:43,617
MARISHA: They misted in.

1179
01:19:43,617 --> 01:19:47,082
TALIESIN: I'm going to hack at his neck with my
sword a couple of times.

1180
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:49,019
MARISHA: I wrote all that stuff down.

1181
01:19:49,019 --> 01:19:56,624
TALIESIN: 28.

1182
01:19:56,624 --> 01:19:58,330
MATT: 28 hits.

1183
01:19:58,330 --> 01:20:03,347
TALIESIN: 22.

1184
01:20:03,347 --> 01:20:04,702
MATT: Hits.

1185
01:20:04,702 --> 01:20:09,022
TALIESIN: 22.

1186
01:20:09,022 --> 01:20:10,921
MATT: All right, all three hit.

1187
01:20:10,921 --> 01:20:23,550
TALIESIN: Ten points, 15 points.

1188
01:20:23,550 --> 01:20:25,217
MATT: All right.

1189
01:20:25,217 --> 01:20:27,324
TALIESIN: Ten points.

1190
01:20:27,324 --> 01:20:32,293
MATT: Ten points, got it. All right, so you slam
the rapier three times into its body, leaving

1191
01:20:32,293 --> 01:20:39,751
these large gaping wounds. It's looking like it's
hurt, and its eyes are darting about, gauging its

1192
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:46,381
chances. That'll be your turn, unless you wish to
move.

1193
01:20:46,381 --> 01:20:48,350
TALIESIN: I'll back away from it.

1194
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:52,640
MATT: Okay, so you're back there. As you back
away, it sees the opportunity and reaches out with

1195
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:55,391
its claws towards you. That is a nine.

1196
01:20:55,391 --> 01:21:01,268
TALIESIN: That does not hit. I'm going to really
quickly also do a second wind.

1197
01:21:01,268 --> 01:21:04,187
MATT: Okay.

1198
01:21:04,187 --> 01:21:06,285
LAURA: Should we ask it questions or something?

1199
01:21:06,285 --> 01:21:07,818
SAM: Does it talk?

1200
01:21:07,818 --> 01:21:09,626
TALIESIN: I think we should probably just kill
it.

1201
01:21:09,626 --> 01:21:10,837
LAURA: Okay.

1202
01:21:10,837 --> 01:21:15,106
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Percy.
Scanlan, you're up.

1203
01:21:15,106 --> 01:21:22,730
SAM: I'm up? I'm not ready. I guess I don't need
to see it. Can I see it?

1204
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:26,018
MATT: Yeah, it's right here. You're right there.

1205
01:21:26,018 --> 01:21:39,334
SAM: Okay. Can I do this? I will just taunt it. I
will use Vicious Mockery on it, and I'll just say:

1206
01:21:39,334 --> 01:21:47,092
What's up? What's up, toothy? Hey, bite me. That's
it. That's all I do.

1207
01:21:47,092 --> 01:21:52,778
MATT: (chuckles) Okay.

1208
01:21:52,778 --> 01:21:55,510
SAM: It's 3d4.

1209
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:59,377
MATT: Yeah, it is. That was about 3d4 worth.

1210
01:21:59,377 --> 01:22:03,115
SAM: It's all I got. I wasn't ready.

1211
01:22:03,115 --> 01:22:05,176
TRAVIS: What's up, toothy? Bite me.

1212
01:22:05,176 --> 01:22:09,492
SAM: I think it's a wisdom.

1213
01:22:09,492 --> 01:22:14,301
MATT: There we go. Yeah, it's a wisdom saving
throw. No, it does not make it with a six.

1214
01:22:14,301 --> 01:22:18,548
LIAM: But his singing skill makes it very bassy
and full.

1215
01:22:18,548 --> 01:22:20,804
MATT: So, you cast Vicious Mockery at 3rd level?

1216
01:22:20,804 --> 01:22:24,345
SAM: Because I'm a level 11.

1217
01:22:24,345 --> 01:22:28,819
MATT: It's 3d4 damage. It does take it and it has
disadvantage on its next attack roll.

1218
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:31,770
SAM: Can I do it at an even higher level?

1219
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:34,256
MATT: No, I was thinking of another spell. Go for
it.

1220
01:22:34,256 --> 01:22:41,959
SAM: Four, two, two. Eight!

1221
01:22:41,959 --> 01:22:46,370
MATT: Eight points of damage.

1222
01:22:46,424 --> 01:22:48,103
How do you want to do this?

1223
01:22:48,103 --> 01:22:52,449
(cheering)

1224
01:22:52,449 --> 01:22:58,900
SAM: That's how I want to do it. I want to do some
pelvic thrusting while I'm saying it: Bite me.

1225
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:02,207
Bite me hard. Bite me, motherfucker, bite me!

1226
01:23:02,207 --> 01:23:03,637
TALIESIN: Urine flying everywhere.

1227
01:23:03,637 --> 01:23:08,787
SAM: Oh shit, I forgot. Oh, there's urine
everywhere. My mustache is falling off; it's

1228
01:23:08,787 --> 01:23:10,761
terrible.

1229
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:14,821
MATT: So as it's trying to take its chances, it
turns to go ahead and flee. Sees Grog, looks over

1230
01:23:14,821 --> 01:23:22,495
and hears you going: "Hey, toothy!" Looks over
back at you. One of the weaknesses of a vampire is

1231
01:23:22,495 --> 01:23:29,598
running water. Technically, it needs to be a large
amount of running water, but this creature is on

1232
01:23:29,598 --> 01:23:36,094
death's door and based on the fact that it is
right on the edge of passing out, anyway, the bit

1233
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:37,645
of your--

1234
01:23:37,645 --> 01:23:39,688
TRAVIS: Constellation Urine.

1235
01:23:39,688 --> 01:23:47,735
MATT: Yes, streaks across the front of the vampire
as it turns around. Grog just instinctually

1236
01:23:47,735 --> 01:23:54,759
slams it with the hammer and smashes it into the
ground. It's hard to say which killed it, but

1237
01:23:54,759 --> 01:23:56,982
you're pretty sure it was you.

1238
01:23:56,982 --> 01:23:58,916
LAURA: Good job, Scanlan!

1239
01:23:58,916 --> 01:24:00,118
SAM: High five! (impact sound)

1240
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:03,082
TRAVIS: Chest bump! (impact sound)

1241
01:24:03,082 --> 01:24:06,761
MATT: Which, for the record, as you high five him,
there is a bit of spatter across your hand.

1242
01:24:06,761 --> 01:24:11,334
LAURA: Future reference, the fog is bad. Not
totally natural.

1243
01:24:11,334 --> 01:24:16,175
LIAM: Oh, there is no gnome like our gnome. Oh my
gods.

1244
01:24:16,175 --> 01:24:19,389
LAURA: Seriously, though, put your dick away.

1245
01:24:19,389 --> 01:24:25,268
SAM: I'm sorry. You're right, I'm sorry. Please
don't judge me. It's morning, it's also

1246
01:24:25,313 --> 01:24:29,213
unseasonably cold in here. That's why it's so
small. Don't judge me.

1247
01:24:29,213 --> 01:24:34,139
TRAVIS: So newsflash: the fog is bad. We probably
need a new hideout.

1248
01:24:34,139 --> 01:24:37,011
LAURA: We probably gave away our location.

1249
01:24:37,011 --> 01:24:38,421
TRAVIS: Nope, no, we killed them all.

1250
01:24:38,472 --> 01:24:40,027
LIAM: He just rolled a die.

1251
01:24:40,027 --> 01:24:42,809
LAURA: We should probably get the fuck out.

1252
01:24:42,809 --> 01:24:45,570
MARISHA: What time is it, midnight?

1253
01:24:45,570 --> 01:24:47,370
MATT: Right now it's a little after midnight.

1254
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:48,821
SAM: So we have not had a full rest?

1255
01:24:48,821 --> 01:24:50,755
TALIESIN: Let's have a full rest.

1256
01:24:50,755 --> 01:24:52,329
LAURA: Really?

1257
01:24:52,329 --> 01:24:56,058
TALIESIN: They don't know where we are yet. We
killed everybody.

1258
01:24:56,058 --> 01:25:00,402
SAM: What if they have some sort of psychic
communication, and what if this is their spawning

1259
01:25:00,402 --> 01:25:03,753
ground? What if the Sun Tree is their spawning
ground?

1260
01:25:03,753 --> 01:25:08,492
MARISHA: Can I do some sort of check to see if the
Sun Tree is their spawning ground?

1261
01:25:08,537 --> 01:25:11,601
MATT: Go ahead and make an intelligence check.

1262
01:25:11,601 --> 01:25:13,282
MARISHA: Just a straight intelligence check?

1263
01:25:13,282 --> 01:25:14,736
MATT: Yeah.

1264
01:25:14,736 --> 01:25:17,836
MARISHA: Okay. That's a natural one.

1265
01:25:17,836 --> 01:25:20,723
LAURA: Yay. Hey, that's what I rolled when I was
trying to check things out.

1266
01:25:20,723 --> 01:25:23,876
MATT: It's hard to say. You don't understand a lot
of the nature of undead; it's not your forte and

1267
01:25:23,876 --> 01:25:26,725
things have been weird around here. You have no
idea.

1268
01:25:26,725 --> 01:25:32,039
LIAM: Here's what we're going to do. I've got one
silver piece right here. I'm going to flip it.

1269
01:25:32,039 --> 01:25:38,398
SAM: Wait. Did you grow that mustache for
tonight?

1270
01:25:38,516 --> 01:25:39,580
LAURA: Yes.

1271
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:41,744
SAM: That's awesome.

1272
01:25:41,744 --> 01:25:50,604
LIAM: It was a goatee a scant five hours ago. Now
it is an Errol Flynn mustache. Thank you. We'll

1273
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:56,978
discuss it at break. I'm going to flip this coin
because that's all we fucking got. If it's a 20,

1274
01:25:56,978 --> 01:26:01,037
we're gonna stay here. If it's a one, we're going to find
another place.

1275
01:26:01,037 --> 01:26:04,218
MARISHA: Sure, fuck it. Leave it up to chance.

1276
01:26:04,218 --> 01:26:06,525
LAURA: We find another place.

1277
01:26:06,525 --> 01:26:08,322
MARISHA: All right.

1278
01:26:08,322 --> 01:26:11,531
TALIESIN: Can we tunnel our way to the tree?

1279
01:26:11,531 --> 01:26:17,869
LAURA: Let's tunnel. I don't want to go up. No, we
can't tunnel

1280
01:26:17,869 --> 01:26:23,553
MARISHA: I can't. I blew all my natural energies
doing that Sunbeam.

1281
01:26:23,553 --> 01:26:28,768
LIAM: It's still night, though. We've had a short
rest. We've got to get out of here. They know

1282
01:26:28,768 --> 01:26:29,892
we're here.

1283
01:26:29,892 --> 01:26:31,688
LAURA: It's night. We can't travel at night.

1284
01:26:31,688 --> 01:26:32,969
TRAVIS: I know.

1285
01:26:32,969 --> 01:26:34,262
LIAM: You're a badass.

1286
01:26:34,262 --> 01:26:36,130
LAURA: There's vampires.

1287
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:38,327
TRAVIS: Yeah, we step outside, it's game on.

1288
01:26:38,327 --> 01:26:41,790
LIAM: As opposed to down here in the hole?

1289
01:26:41,790 --> 01:26:46,651
LAURA: I feel like we're safer down here. At least
there's only so many places they can attack from.

1290
01:26:46,651 --> 01:26:48,958
SAM: But the coin said we should go.

1291
01:26:48,958 --> 01:26:56,426
LIAM: That's fine. When you went down that cavern
that one time, that worked out really well. So

1292
01:26:56,426 --> 01:26:57,849
let's do what she says.

1293
01:26:57,849 --> 01:27:03,802
MARISHA: Wait, are you talking about when Vex and
I came back with Clarota and he helped us for

1294
01:27:03,802 --> 01:27:06,773
quite a while? Is that what you're talking about?

1295
01:27:06,773 --> 01:27:09,295
LAURA: That worked out really well because we
probably wouldn't have

1296
01:27:09,295 --> 01:27:11,502
defeated K'Varn without him.

1297
01:27:11,502 --> 01:27:14,726
MARISHA: Yeah, you're right, Vax. Vex, let's
stay.

1298
01:27:14,726 --> 01:27:17,011
LIAM: That's very open to interpretation.

1299
01:27:17,011 --> 01:27:20,149
TRAVIS: Until he betrayed us and tried to eat
Scanlan's brain.

1300
01:27:20,149 --> 01:27:23,956
TALIESIN: I'm agreeing with the women because I want to
live to see the morning.

1301
01:27:24,016 --> 01:27:26,257
SAM: I still think Clarota was a pretty good guy.

1302
01:27:26,257 --> 01:27:32,191
TRAVIS: We decide to stay.

1303
01:27:32,191 --> 01:27:33,900
MATT: All right.

1304
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:34,982
TRAVIS: We stay.

1305
01:27:34,982 --> 01:27:36,265
LAURA: We're stupid.

1306
01:27:36,265 --> 01:27:37,878
TRAVIS: No we're not. We'll be fine.

1307
01:27:37,878 --> 01:27:43,388
LAURA: What if we went up above ground and went
into the second floor? So we're not underground.

1308
01:27:43,388 --> 01:27:47,913
SAM: All right, sure, let's do that. That's no
good, either.

1309
01:27:47,913 --> 01:27:55,716
MARISHA: Are there two stories? I technically used
my Hallucinatory Terrain spell to make it look

1310
01:27:55,716 --> 01:27:57,683
like a one-story tavern.

1311
01:27:57,683 --> 01:28:05,356
SAM: What about this? How about we don't sleep in
the tunnel? We barricade that up and we just sleep

1312
01:28:05,356 --> 01:28:12,286
in the cellar. Not the tunnel, the cellar.

1313
01:28:12,286 --> 01:28:14,282
LAURA: All right, let's do it. It's fine,
whatever.

1314
01:28:14,282 --> 01:28:16,050
LIAM: Back and to the left.

1315
01:28:16,050 --> 01:28:21,050
SAM: Can we barricade the cellar somehow?

1316
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:25,907
MARISHA: That I can do. I'll do a Wall of Stone
where I tunneled.

1317
01:28:25,907 --> 01:28:29,743
LAURA: We're very packed in. It's nice and cozy
and warm.

1318
01:28:29,802 --> 01:28:32,892
MATT: It is, and you're surrounded by a number of
bottles of wine--

1319
01:28:32,892 --> 01:28:34,261
LIAM: And bear farts.

1320
01:28:34,261 --> 01:28:37,063
TALIESIN: And all the wine we stole. We stole a
lot of wine.

1321
01:28:37,063 --> 01:28:38,903
MARISHA: Can we pop open a bottle of that wine?

1322
01:28:38,903 --> 01:28:40,336
TALIESIN: And try and relax?

1323
01:28:40,336 --> 01:28:43,066
TRAVIS: Yeah, we can. I guess I'll allow it.

1324
01:28:43,066 --> 01:28:48,710
MATT: Pop open the wine, share a bottle, 
and you all manage to find your way

1325
01:28:48,753 --> 01:28:52,203
back to sleep. Who's taking watch now?

1326
01:28:52,203 --> 01:28:54,805
MARISHA: I'll go with Vax because I haven't been
yet.

1327
01:28:54,805 --> 01:28:56,848
MATT: Okay, so you two take the next watch.

1328
01:28:56,848 --> 01:29:00,107
LAURA: I stay awake because I don't want them
to be alone.

1329
01:29:00,107 --> 01:29:03,841
MATT: (chuckles) All right, the three of you take
this watch.

1330
01:29:03,841 --> 01:29:05,246
MARISHA: Half-elves, what what.

1331
01:29:05,246 --> 01:29:06,695
SAM: I go back to sleep.

1332
01:29:06,695 --> 01:29:10,253
TRAVIS: Half-elves, what what.

1333
01:29:10,253 --> 01:29:13,986
LIAM: Hello, my half-elven brothers.

1334
01:29:13,986 --> 01:29:19,589
MATT: All right, a few hours of awkward
conversation--

1335
01:29:19,589 --> 01:29:22,490
LIAM: (shushing noises) Jeralt is speaking.

1336
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:26,214
MATT: It's <i>Geralt,</i> thank you very much.

1337
01:29:26,261 --> 01:29:28,374
LAURA: Sigil.

1338
01:29:28,374 --> 01:29:31,926
LIAM: I haven't played that game, but is your name
Solid Snake?

1339
01:29:31,926 --> 01:29:35,257
MATT: I will attack both of you.

1340
01:29:35,257 --> 01:29:37,527
MARISHA: Cue internet rage.

1341
01:29:37,527 --> 01:29:44,796
MATT: (laughs) Oh man. All right, so after you
guys take your watch, with seeming no incident,

1342
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:51,175
although some awkward conversation and a few jabs
here and there. Final watch, who's taking that?

1343
01:29:51,175 --> 01:29:56,047
SAM: I've already watched.

1344
01:29:56,047 --> 01:29:59,295
LAURA: I need to sleep. You need to sleep.

1345
01:29:59,295 --> 01:30:01,161
TRAVIS: Fuck it, I'll do it.

1346
01:30:01,204 --> 01:30:02,911
MATT: All right, Grog is up.

1347
01:30:02,911 --> 01:30:05,149
LAURA: Trinket stays awake with you, though.

1348
01:30:05,149 --> 01:30:09,504
MATT: And Trinket does like staying awake with you,
Grog. You both understand each other on a very feral

1349
01:30:09,547 --> 01:30:10,971
and unintelligent level.

1350
01:30:10,971 --> 01:30:17,774
TRAVIS: We play hand slaps. (impact sound) Fuck.
Claws catching every once in a while.

1351
01:30:17,794 --> 01:30:26,812
MATT: Eventually, everyone's managed to gather
your evening's rest. You come to consciousness,

1352
01:30:26,812 --> 01:30:32,498
the cold morning greets you. No seeming further
incident in the cellar during the evening.

1353
01:30:32,498 --> 01:30:33,835
TRAVIS: You're welcome.

1354
01:30:33,835 --> 01:30:37,462
MATT: I would like everyone to make a wisdom
saving throw, please.

1355
01:30:37,462 --> 01:30:38,632
TRAVIS: No problem.

1356
01:30:38,632 --> 01:30:42,312
TALIESIN: Wisdom saving or just wisdom?

1357
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:44,608
MATT: Wisdom saving throw.

1358
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:48,970
MARISHA: Saving throw? Oh right, because we've been
in a cursed land for a while.

1359
01:30:48,970 --> 01:30:54,793
SAM: Does my thing help me?

1360
01:30:54,793 --> 01:30:57,959
MATT: Your thing help you?

1361
01:30:57,959 --> 01:30:59,815
SAM: I have some thing.

1362
01:30:59,815 --> 01:31:00,813
LIAM: The cube?

1363
01:31:00,813 --> 01:31:01,925
MARISHA: Jack-of-all-trades?

1364
01:31:01,925 --> 01:31:04,901
SAM: No, shit. I'll find it. Don't worry, come
back to me.

1365
01:31:04,901 --> 01:31:06,137
MATT: Okay.

1366
01:31:06,137 --> 01:31:07,139
LIAM: 17.

1367
01:31:07,139 --> 01:31:09,155
LAURA: 17.

1368
01:31:09,155 --> 01:31:11,264
TRAVIS: 11.

1369
01:31:11,264 --> 01:31:14,208
SAM: What is this? Wisdom?

1370
01:31:14,208 --> 01:31:15,920
MATT: Wisdom saving throw.

1371
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,566
SAM: Advantage.

1372
01:31:18,566 --> 01:31:20,516
MATT: There you go.

1373
01:31:20,516 --> 01:31:23,068
SAM: 14.

1374
01:31:23,068 --> 01:31:25,732
MATT: Okay. Keyleth?

1375
01:31:25,732 --> 01:31:28,188
MARISHA: 24.

1376
01:31:28,188 --> 01:31:30,259
TALIESIN: Eight.

1377
01:31:30,259 --> 01:31:32,649
MARISHA and LAURA: Oh, not Percy!

1378
01:31:32,649 --> 01:31:34,268
TRAVIS: You don't know.

1379
01:31:34,268 --> 01:31:36,631
MARISHA: Oh god, look at that smirk on his face!

1380
01:31:36,631 --> 01:31:38,043
TALIESIN: Fuck you, Matt.

1381
01:31:38,043 --> 01:31:42,562
MATT: So as you all come to consciousness, I would
like you to put another point of corruption on

1382
01:31:42,562 --> 01:31:43,451
your sheet.

1383
01:31:43,451 --> 01:31:46,319
LAURA: Oh no, how many can you get before you're
totally evil?

1384
01:31:46,319 --> 01:31:50,240
MARISHA: What does that mean? Now what?

1385
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:51,559
MATT: Tell you in a second.

1386
01:31:51,559 --> 01:31:53,374
TALIESIN: Am I still coughing?

1387
01:31:53,374 --> 01:31:59,943
MATT: Oh, you're still coughing. You guys all come
back to consciousness. Cold morning greets you.

1388
01:31:59,943 --> 01:32:04,250
Food probably is going to be in order pretty soon.
You guys didn't get much of a meal the evening

1389
01:32:04,292 --> 01:32:07,962
before, and you're all still a little sore after
your evening's rest. You've pushed through and

1390
01:32:07,962 --> 01:32:10,267
recovered from your exhaustion from your frenzied
rage.

1391
01:32:10,267 --> 01:32:11,563
TRAVIS: Thank you.

1392
01:32:11,563 --> 01:32:18,270
SAM: Ring of Mind-Shielding, is what I was going to
say.

1393
01:32:18,270 --> 01:32:21,014
TALIESIN: That mustache is getting very iffy.

1394
01:32:21,014 --> 01:32:23,073
SAM: I don't know what you're talking about.

1395
01:32:23,073 --> 01:32:25,805
TRAVIS: Do we want some dried food rations?

1396
01:32:25,805 --> 01:32:31,766
LAURA: Plus, there's probably dried food in this
cellar.

1397
01:32:31,766 --> 01:32:33,398
TRAVIS: I have a ton in the bag.

1398
01:32:33,398 --> 01:32:36,118
MARISHA: Can we do a check to see if there's any
jerky or anything in the cellar?

1399
01:32:36,118 --> 01:32:37,584
Did we already do that?

1400
01:32:37,584 --> 01:32:42,488
MATT: You guys looked through. You found some
jerky, some dried food that's serviceable. Not the

1401
01:32:42,488 --> 01:32:54,700
best, but serviceable. All right. Going forward,
the sadistic tendencies that you've been exerting

1402
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:59,979
through a lot of this event are becoming harder
and harder to control. Be mindful that when you

1403
01:32:59,979 --> 01:33:04,243
strike to kill, you strike to torture before you
do.

1404
01:33:04,243 --> 01:33:08,579
SAM: Whoa, that's so cool. I mean terrible.

1405
01:33:08,579 --> 01:33:10,999
LAURA: Is he the only one that was affected this
time, again?

1406
01:33:10,999 --> 01:33:13,448
MATT: Yep. Everyone else rolled above a ten.

1407
01:33:13,448 --> 01:33:18,384
TALIESIN: I have a very low wisdom, and I rolled
really badly.

1408
01:33:18,384 --> 01:33:26,243
MATT: All right, so. You finish your meal. Looking
outside, what little bit of the windows you can

1409
01:33:26,243 --> 01:33:29,673
see, since you covered them all with cloth, there's
a little bit of daylight peeking through. It's

1410
01:33:29,673 --> 01:33:35,842
soft daylight. It looks like, while it's not
raining, there is still a cloud-covered sky. What

1411
01:33:35,842 --> 01:33:37,314
is your plan of action?

1412
01:33:37,314 --> 01:33:41,257
TRAVIS: I have a question. My 11 points of
permanently lowered hit points from the necrotic

1413
01:33:41,257 --> 01:33:44,599
damage, can that be healed with a potion of
greater healing?

1414
01:33:44,599 --> 01:33:50,089
MATT: Those hit points have all come back, by the
way, guys. Over the night, the hit points you lost

1415
01:33:50,089 --> 01:33:52,658
on your hit point total have been returned.

1416
01:33:52,658 --> 01:33:56,730
LIAM: I didn't suffer from this, but
permanently lowered health?

1417
01:33:56,777 --> 01:34:01,034
MATT: Yeah, from the bite? That recovers after a
long rest.

1418
01:34:01,034 --> 01:34:03,282
TRAVIS: Literally what I just asked.

1419
01:34:03,282 --> 01:34:05,978
SAM: What about the hit points that were lowered?

1420
01:34:05,978 --> 01:34:08,290
TRAVIS: Literally what I just asked.

1421
01:34:08,290 --> 01:34:14,703
MATT: What? Don't-- My brain doesn't work--
(laughs) It's hot in here.

1422
01:34:14,703 --> 01:34:21,753
TRAVIS: Are we going to find another house to kill
now? I mean, to carefully investigate and

1423
01:34:21,753 --> 01:34:26,387
thoroughly due diligence the heads before we smash
them.

1424
01:34:26,387 --> 01:34:31,807
LIAM: Scanlan, I think you and I going to go see
how people are feeling in the town while everybody

1425
01:34:31,807 --> 01:34:34,728
else looks for a new hidey-hole, yeah?

1426
01:34:34,773 --> 01:34:39,291
MARISHA: Are we tunneling through this entire
city?

1427
01:34:39,291 --> 01:34:42,608
LIAM: I think you are, but if it's first thing in the
morning, I don't think the Briarwoods could have

1428
01:34:42,654 --> 01:34:47,834
gotten to everybody yet, so I think you and I
could do our father-son act for like an hour.

1429
01:34:47,834 --> 01:34:50,031
SAM: Did you just say fart the son act?

1430
01:34:50,031 --> 01:34:54,844
LIAM: Fart the son and the vampires, they're
done-- father and son.

1431
01:34:54,844 --> 01:34:57,106
SAM: Oh, father and son. Oh! Seeming!

1432
01:34:57,106 --> 01:34:58,847
LIAM: Because you're little, and I'm tall.

1433
01:34:58,847 --> 01:35:00,019
SAM: Yes.

1434
01:35:00,019 --> 01:35:05,089
TALIESIN: Why don't we Seem all of us so we can go
take a look around while you talk to--

1435
01:35:05,089 --> 01:35:06,827
TRAVIS: Yeah, we've got to find a different
spot.

1436
01:35:06,827 --> 01:35:10,191
LIAM: Quickly, though, because even though we
don't look like ourselves, they know that there

1437
01:35:10,259 --> 01:35:11,897
are strangers in town.

1438
01:35:11,897 --> 01:35:14,509
LAURA: Grog, give everybody a little bit of the
Dust of Tracelessness.

1439
01:35:14,509 --> 01:35:17,028
TALIESIN: And we have the earpieces.

1440
01:35:17,028 --> 01:35:19,408
SAM: Do we? Do you?

1441
01:35:19,408 --> 01:35:20,639
TALIESIN: I have one now.

1442
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:21,686
MARISHA: I have one.

1443
01:35:21,686 --> 01:35:22,866
LIAM: I have one.

1444
01:35:22,866 --> 01:35:28,992
SAM: Okay. So I am to Seem us as peasants again?

1445
01:35:28,992 --> 01:35:29,962
LAURA: Yes.

1446
01:35:29,962 --> 01:35:31,189
LIAM: Same peasants, yes.

1447
01:35:31,189 --> 01:35:32,674
TRAVIS: Different-looking peasants.

1448
01:35:32,674 --> 01:35:40,549
SAM: (sings) Seeming. Feel me, touch me, heal
me.

1449
01:35:40,549 --> 01:35:42,166
LIAM: Sorry, folks.

1450
01:35:42,166 --> 01:35:47,528
SAM: All right, so we're all peasants.

1451
01:35:47,528 --> 01:35:49,386
MATT: Gnome bard wizard over here.

1452
01:35:49,386 --> 01:35:53,978
SAM: I'm a cute little boy with a lazy eye. To
match my grandma.

1453
01:35:53,995 --> 01:35:55,299
MATT: There you go.

1454
01:35:55,299 --> 01:35:58,408
TALIESIN: I have the Hat of Disguise on
underneath, just so even if it drops, I'm still

1455
01:35:58,408 --> 01:35:59,472
not me.

1456
01:35:59,472 --> 01:36:01,452
MATT: Okay, good to know. All right.

1457
01:36:01,452 --> 01:36:05,542
MARISHA: So are we breaking up? Are you two going
to scout the town and the rest of us will--

1458
01:36:05,542 --> 01:36:07,420
LIAM: We're going to talk to a few people, right,
kiddo?

1459
01:36:07,441 --> 01:36:08,497
SAM: Yes.

1460
01:36:08,497 --> 01:36:10,382
MARISHA: The rest of us are finding a new hideout?

1461
01:36:10,382 --> 01:36:12,106
LAURA: Yeah, we're looking for a new hideout.

1462
01:36:12,149 --> 01:36:13,719
TALIESIN: Where should we meet?

1463
01:36:13,719 --> 01:36:15,235
MARISHA: We've got the earrings.

1464
01:36:15,235 --> 01:36:18,487
TALIESIN: We've got the earrings, so once we find
a place, we'll let you know.

1465
01:36:18,487 --> 01:36:20,041
LIAM: We'll come to you, yeah.

1466
01:36:20,041 --> 01:36:23,801
LAURA: Check in every 30 minutes. It's dangerous.

1467
01:36:23,801 --> 01:36:25,381
MARISHA: Okay. I like that plan.

1468
01:36:25,381 --> 01:36:27,413
TRAVIS: What's the safety word?

1469
01:36:27,413 --> 01:36:30,366
SAM: I'd leave that up to Percy.

1470
01:36:30,366 --> 01:36:32,569
MARISHA: I was going to say I'd leave that up to
you.

1471
01:36:32,569 --> 01:36:35,638
LAURA: Meet back here in two hours--

1472
01:36:35,638 --> 01:36:37,740
LIAM: Too long.

1473
01:36:37,740 --> 01:36:42,377
LAURA: Hold on. Meet back here in two hours if we
haven't heard from everything.

1474
01:36:42,377 --> 01:36:47,647
TALIESIN: If everything goes wrong, we meet back
here in two hours. Otherwise, check in every 30

1475
01:36:47,647 --> 01:36:49,185
minutes. Do we need a code word?

1476
01:36:49,185 --> 01:36:51,714
SAM: Yeah, we need a code word.

1477
01:36:51,763 --> 01:36:52,765
TRAVIS: Doritos.

1478
01:36:52,765 --> 01:36:55,666
LAURA: I was thinking Dorito, too! How weird.

1479
01:36:55,666 --> 01:36:56,997
TRAVIS: Married.

1480
01:36:56,997 --> 01:36:58,870
MARISHA: Dorito. I like that.

1481
01:36:58,870 --> 01:37:08,139
MATT: Dorito. A strange elven term for flatmate.
All right, so, as you guys press out into the day's

1482
01:37:08,172 --> 01:37:13,202
sun, we'll take a quick break. We'll be back here
in five minutes to continue this.

1483
01:37:13,202 --> 01:37:14,924
MARISHA: Hot. I might have to de-armor.

1484
01:37:14,924 --> 01:37:16,689
TRAVIS: I'm taking this wig off.

1485
01:37:16,689 --> 01:37:18,848
MATT: See you guys shortly.

1486
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:19,646
[break]

1487
01:54:28,382 --> 01:54:34,201
ZAC: Hey, what's up, everybody? Welcome back. Real
quick, couple announcements, the first of

1488
01:54:34,246 --> 01:54:38,710
which: tomorrow, here on Geek and Sundry, we have
a special episode of Group Hug; it's going to be

1489
01:54:38,710 --> 01:54:43,208
Alien versus Predator versus the Alien Queen.
Cthulhu might be thrown in there. We're still

1490
01:54:43,208 --> 01:54:51,904
working out the details, but we're going to kick
off Halloween. It's going to be pretty rad. And

1491
01:54:51,904 --> 01:54:54,890
the chat room bought those figures for us, so
we're going to play with them, and it's going to

1492
01:54:54,890 --> 01:54:58,158
be awesome. And then after that, we have a really
awesome band tomorrow night, and they're going to

1493
01:54:58,158 --> 01:55:02,708
be coming in costume, and then we've got the game
Nightmare on VHS.

1494
01:55:02,708 --> 01:55:05,809
MATT: Oh, yeah! I used to have that, man.

1495
01:55:05,809 --> 01:55:09,344
ZAC: Yeah. We're going to be rocking out Nightmare
tomorrow night, and Felicia's probably going to be

1496
01:55:09,344 --> 01:55:13,183
stopping by, and Ryon Day. We're going to have a
big old Halloween party with Rock Band and

1497
01:55:13,183 --> 01:55:16,086
everything else. So you guys are more than welcome
to join us and celebrate Halloween.

1498
01:55:16,086 --> 01:55:17,938
MATT: You should be Baron Samedi for that one.

1499
01:55:17,938 --> 01:55:19,021
ZAC: Baron Samedi?

1500
01:55:19,021 --> 01:55:22,357
MATT: He's one of the characters you can play in
that. God, that thing was so awful. It's going to

1501
01:55:22,357 --> 01:55:23,780
be so great.

1502
01:55:23,780 --> 01:55:25,124
ZAC: It's so bad-good. I cannot wait.

1503
01:55:25,124 --> 01:55:28,397
MATT: Whose turn is it? You. You are banished. Oh,
that guy was so good.

1504
01:55:28,397 --> 01:55:32,824
ZAC: I can't wait, guys, so tune in for that. And
for all the people last week that voted for me to

1505
01:55:32,824 --> 01:55:39,355
have sideburns and a Freddie Mercury mustache, I
have kept both all week, and tomorrow I will not

1506
01:55:39,355 --> 01:55:44,712
have to anymore, so thank you for that. I love you
guys. You're great. Good times, good job. That's

1507
01:55:44,712 --> 01:55:46,414
all I have to say.

1508
01:55:46,414 --> 01:55:51,343
MATT: (laughs) Man, Nightmare. That's almost as
good as Experience Bij. All right, so. Quick

1509
01:55:51,343 --> 01:55:56,128
announcement we have for you guys right now, as
well. Tonight's episode, if you haven't seen from

1510
01:55:56,128 --> 01:56:00,873
the setup, is actually sponsored by Tor Books,
which is awesome. If you guys aren't familiar with

1511
01:56:00,873 --> 01:56:04,530
Tor, you need to go check out what they have. I
grew up reading a lot of the stuff that Tor

1512
01:56:04,530 --> 01:56:11,448
published. They're one of the major publishers of
science fiction and fantasy out there. They've

1513
01:56:11,448 --> 01:56:15,135
been going for a long time. I was raised on a lot
of their spectrum. Right now, they're pushing the

1514
01:56:15,135 --> 01:56:22,600
awesome New York best-selling book Shadows of
Self. Yes. That's the one. Which Felicia really,

1515
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:26,348
really enjoyed, and if you guys have the
opportunity to go check it out, please do so.

1516
01:56:26,348 --> 01:56:35,059
Their stuff is awesome. So thank you, Tor. I think
that's it. So if everyone's back here, let's go

1517
01:56:35,059 --> 01:56:37,946
ahead and-- oh, there he is. I was waiting for
Burt to return.

1518
01:56:37,946 --> 01:56:40,265
SAM: I didn't want to disturb your announcements.

1519
01:56:40,265 --> 01:56:41,873
TRAVIS: Sit down, you dickless wonder.

1520
01:56:41,873 --> 01:56:43,663
MATT: Oh, it's a sleeping monkey.

1521
01:56:43,663 --> 01:56:48,026
SAM: Easy, Helga. You meant nothing to me.

1522
01:56:48,073 --> 01:56:52,496
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh?

1523
01:56:52,496 --> 01:56:55,129
LIAM: Still so little expression on that face.

1524
01:56:55,129 --> 01:56:59,214
SAM: I don't know what you're saying. I can
perform perfectly.

1525
01:56:59,214 --> 01:57:03,941
TRAVIS: I've moved on from Scanlan, and I've cut
my hair as a sign of change.

1526
01:57:03,941 --> 01:57:07,578
LIAM: Like Vasquez.

1527
01:57:07,578 --> 01:57:09,325
LAURA: Yeah, I like it.

1528
01:57:09,325 --> 01:57:13,081
TRAVIS: Yeah, Aliens. Such a badass, Vasquez.

1529
01:57:13,081 --> 01:57:19,298
MARISHA: I've taken my scarf off because it's
really hot. It's really hot in here.

1530
01:57:19,298 --> 01:57:24,441
MATT: You ever been mistaken for a man? Come on,
you've got to know the response to that.

1531
01:57:24,441 --> 01:57:27,243
LAURA: No, have you?

1532
01:57:27,243 --> 01:57:28,632
MATT: Thank you, Laura.

1533
01:57:28,632 --> 01:57:29,968
LAURA: You got it.

1534
01:57:29,968 --> 01:57:33,830
MATT: Grog has disadvantage on his next attack.

1535
01:57:33,830 --> 01:57:35,183
(groaning)

1536
01:57:35,183 --> 01:57:36,348
LAURA: And Vex has advantage?

1537
01:57:36,348 --> 01:57:40,322
MATT: Yeah, probably. We'll see when we get there.
All right, so.

1538
01:57:40,322 --> 01:57:43,397
LIAM: (explosion noise)

1539
01:57:43,397 --> 01:57:52,754
MATT: Down. (laughs) I will Quen all over your
ass. I got Aard signs all day, yo. All right,

1540
01:57:52,816 --> 01:57:57,693
anyway. So. What are the groups? You guys are
splitting up across the city?

1541
01:57:57,693 --> 01:57:58,799
LAURA: Oh, right. Yes.

1542
01:57:58,799 --> 01:57:59,896
SAM: Is that a thing? Are we doing this?

1543
01:57:59,896 --> 01:58:02,171
LAURA: This is the dumbest idea, by the way.

1544
01:58:02,171 --> 01:58:03,280
TRAVIS: No, it's the best.

1545
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:05,824
LIAM: Daddy Daycare. You and I, we're going to go
talk to people.

1546
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:07,017
SAM: Papa, let's go.

1547
01:58:07,017 --> 01:58:08,330
LAURA: Keyleth, you and me.

1548
01:58:08,330 --> 01:58:09,276
MARISHA: All right.

1549
01:58:09,276 --> 01:58:12,183
TALIESIN: No, the four of us are sticking
together, I thought.

1550
01:58:12,183 --> 01:58:14,167
LAURA: All right. And Trinket.

1551
01:58:14,167 --> 01:58:16,799
TALIESIN: Trinket the donkey.

1552
01:58:16,799 --> 01:58:18,426
SAM: Oh, yes.

1553
01:58:18,426 --> 01:58:20,538
TALIESIN: We'll go to the Alcove.

1554
01:58:20,538 --> 01:58:22,028
TRAVIS: We're going to the Alcove.

1555
01:58:22,028 --> 01:58:23,637
MATT: Good. So.

1556
01:58:23,637 --> 01:58:27,365
LIAM: What was the name of the guy that Grog
de-tongued and kicked out the window?

1557
01:58:27,365 --> 01:58:29,014
SAM and TRAVIS: Kerrion.

1558
01:58:29,014 --> 01:58:30,768
MARISHA: That was Vox.

1559
01:58:30,768 --> 01:58:33,308
MATT: He was shot in the face by Percy. This was
Vouk.

1560
01:58:33,308 --> 01:58:34,518
TRAVIS: Got it.

1561
01:58:34,518 --> 01:58:35,560
LIAM: Thanks.

1562
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:37,104
SAM: So Vouk is alive?

1563
01:58:37,104 --> 01:58:42,666
LAURA: And I'm sure he told everybody what we
looked like. We can't look like the same Seeming

1564
01:58:42,666 --> 01:58:43,712
that we were before.

1565
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:46,516
TALIESIN: He can only tell them what we look like
if he's a very clever artist.

1566
01:58:46,516 --> 01:58:47,688
LAURA: Yeah, but he can write it down.

1567
01:58:47,688 --> 01:58:49,125
TRAVIS: He's really good at charades.

1568
01:58:49,125 --> 01:58:51,019
MARISHA: But they already know what we look like.

1569
01:58:51,019 --> 01:58:52,919
TRAVIS: Should've broken his fingers, too.

1570
01:58:52,919 --> 01:58:53,904
LAURA: Seeming.

1571
01:58:53,904 --> 01:58:56,482
MARISHA: I thought we dropped Seeming, though?

1572
01:58:56,482 --> 01:58:57,572
LAURA: We didn't.

1573
01:58:57,572 --> 01:59:00,237
SAM: Would I have been smart enough to Seem us
slightly differently?

1574
01:59:00,237 --> 01:59:06,702
MATT: Based on this conversation happening now?
No. You have already transformed everybody into

1575
01:59:06,702 --> 01:59:07,719
the original--

1576
01:59:07,719 --> 01:59:09,165
SAM: Except I gave myself a lazy eye.

1577
01:59:09,165 --> 01:59:10,900
MATT: Except you have a lazy eye, which is
different.

1578
01:59:10,900 --> 01:59:16,512
LIAM: I don't think it makes a difference. I think
there's no new people in this town.

1579
01:59:16,512 --> 01:59:21,730
MARISHA: True. Even newer people might be
suspicious.

1580
01:59:21,730 --> 01:59:26,666
TRAVIS: We don't give a fuck. We're walking
around. We don't give a shit. You people have got

1581
01:59:26,666 --> 01:59:34,152
lazy eyes. We've got a donkey. No problem.
Recognize us, I dare you.

1582
01:59:34,152 --> 01:59:35,692
LAURA: I have crazy eyes.

1583
01:59:35,692 --> 01:59:37,466
MATT: Yeah, you do. Crazy old woman eyes.

1584
01:59:37,466 --> 01:59:38,943
LAURA: They're like (growls).

1585
01:59:38,943 --> 01:59:40,582
MATT: Just like that.

1586
01:59:40,582 --> 01:59:44,045
LIAM: But you guys are tunneling around, looking
for new digs, right?

1587
01:59:44,045 --> 01:59:45,296
MARISHA: No, we're walking around.

1588
01:59:45,296 --> 01:59:47,300
SAM: Well, that's up to them.

1589
01:59:47,300 --> 01:59:50,553
LIAM: That's up to you. I thought-- who cares what
I thought?

1590
01:59:50,553 --> 01:59:54,622
MATT: Indeed. So you and Scanlan continue off into
the city.

1591
01:59:54,654 --> 01:59:58,823
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on them before
they leave. On all of us.

1592
01:59:58,823 --> 02:00:04,622
MATT: Okay. All right. There is a radius to it, I
believe.

1593
02:00:04,622 --> 02:00:05,905
LAURA: Oh, there is?

1594
02:00:05,905 --> 02:00:07,771
MATT: They have to stay within a certain area of
you.

1595
02:00:07,771 --> 02:00:09,315
LAURA: I really should read about spells more.

1596
02:00:09,315 --> 02:00:16,170
MATT: I can just look it up right here. I would do
that, yeah. I would recommend

1597
02:00:16,170 --> 02:00:17,639
looking up your spells.

1598
02:00:17,639 --> 02:00:19,246
LAURA: Oh, within 30 feet of me.

1599
02:00:19,246 --> 02:00:22,479
TALIESIN: What part of town is the Alcove?

1600
02:00:22,479 --> 02:00:26,420
MATT: The Alcove would be on the northwest side of
it.

1601
02:00:26,420 --> 02:00:33,473
LIAM: She's not even here. You're with me.
Gavroche, come on! And I swat him as hard as I can

1602
02:00:33,473 --> 02:00:34,985
in the back of the head.

1603
02:00:34,985 --> 02:00:39,077
SAM: Thenardier is our precious father.

1604
02:00:39,077 --> 02:00:46,920
MATT: The four of you head off towards the Alcove.
Heading out into the day, the cloud cover is

1605
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:52,321
pretty thick. There is just general moisture and
mist to the air. It probably could rain any

1606
02:00:52,321 --> 02:00:59,216
second. You continue moving towards the
northwestern side of the town. You do notice, in

1607
02:00:59,216 --> 02:01:03,781
comparison to previous days, there is a little
more energy to the streets. People seem to be

1608
02:01:03,781 --> 02:01:12,458
moving back and forth with hustle and business.
You do also see, as you head on your way out,

1609
02:01:12,458 --> 02:01:19,028
there is still a slight bit of smoke slowly
swimming up from the house in the distance, and

1610
02:01:19,028 --> 02:01:24,948
what minor embers were not put out by the
rainfall, it's just a little trace of smoke.

1611
02:01:24,948 --> 02:01:26,986
TALIESIN: Was it the north, the east, or the west
manor?

1612
02:01:26,986 --> 02:01:29,019
MATT: That was the eastern.

1613
02:01:29,019 --> 02:01:30,299
TALIESIN: Eastern manor.

1614
02:01:30,299 --> 02:01:37,522
MATT: Yeah, that one is partially burned down. So
as you continue heading northwest, you eventually

1615
02:01:37,522 --> 02:01:42,515
make your way to where you recall the Alcove was.
Now, when you get there, it's a relatively

1616
02:01:42,515 --> 02:01:51,287
plain-looking building. Dark woods. There's a sign
out front that says The Alcove. It's old. The

1617
02:01:51,287 --> 02:01:57,822
metal that holds the sign has rusted a bit. The
doors are open, and as you push into the building,

1618
02:01:57,822 --> 02:02:06,651
it's largely empty and seemingly unkempt, compared
to the previous oddity shops you've been to. Many

1619
02:02:06,651 --> 02:02:13,924
books about enchantment look left out on one of
the nearby tables, partially read and abandoned as

1620
02:02:13,973 --> 02:02:18,013
if they were being flipped through. And then as
you look across the room, behind the counter,

1621
02:02:18,013 --> 02:02:24,004
there's a young girl in her late teens, a blonde
waif of a girl, who's currently thumbing through a

1622
02:02:24,004 --> 02:02:29,763
book and notices you guys enter. "Oh! Hi. Can I
help you?"

1623
02:02:29,763 --> 02:02:39,699
TALIESIN: Yes, we're looking to buy a few things,
and we were wondering-- actually, I used to do

1624
02:02:39,699 --> 02:02:42,614
business with Simon. Is Simon around?

1625
02:02:42,614 --> 02:02:50,728
MATT: "Simon was called away for a special project
by the Briarwoods about six months ago. He told me

1626
02:02:50,728 --> 02:02:56,652
"to look over the store while he's gone. I'm sorry,
we're mostly out of stock. We don't have much here

1627
02:02:56,652 --> 02:02:57,883
"at the moment."

1628
02:02:57,883 --> 02:03:01,489
TALIESIN: He was called away on a special project?
What sort of special project?

1629
02:03:01,489 --> 02:03:06,543
MATT: "I don't know. He lives in the castle now. I
mean, he would visit every week or so, but he

1630
02:03:06,543 --> 02:03:09,168
"hasn't been back in almost a month, and I'm a
little worried."

1631
02:03:09,168 --> 02:03:10,864
TRAVIS: He lives at the castle?

1632
02:03:10,864 --> 02:03:16,313
TALIESIN: He lives at the castle? Oh.

1633
02:03:16,313 --> 02:03:21,861
MARISHA: Did he ever tell you about any details of
this special assignment?

1634
02:03:21,861 --> 02:03:28,443
MATT: "No, unfortunately. He was the real
enchanter here. I'm just trying to do my best to

1635
02:03:28,443 --> 02:03:30,127
"learn what I can while he's gone."

1636
02:03:30,127 --> 02:03:32,815
LAURA: Speak up, girl! I can't hear you.

1637
02:03:32,815 --> 02:03:38,917
MATT "I'm sorry, miss! I'm sorry. I'm Jordana
Whisk. I'm Simon's daughter."

1638
02:03:38,917 --> 02:03:45,842
LAURA: Simon's daughter. Now, did he like the
Briarwoods?

1639
02:03:45,842 --> 02:03:54,565
MATT: She gives you a look and looks about the
room for a moment. "The Briarwoods have been very

1640
02:03:54,565 --> 02:03:57,250
"fair and just rulers of this land."

1641
02:03:57,250 --> 02:04:00,445
LAURA: I'm trying to look straight at her, but I'm
really looking that direction and over there.

1642
02:04:00,445 --> 02:04:07,758
MATT: She's gathered as much and is seemingly
offput by the whole presentation. "The Briarwoods

1643
02:04:07,758 --> 02:04:12,560
"are just and fair, and we should not speak ill of
them in public."

1644
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:16,865
TRAVIS: Can somebody see if there's something
watching?

1645
02:04:16,865 --> 02:04:24,323
MARISHA: Yeah, can I do a perception check around
the room and see if there's any indications that

1646
02:04:24,323 --> 02:04:27,081
the Briarwoods might have--

1647
02:04:27,081 --> 02:04:28,177
TRAVIS: Monitoring?

1648
02:04:28,177 --> 02:04:38,402
MARISHA: Yeah, a bug? Like some sort of something
where they might be monitoring this place.

1649
02:04:38,402 --> 02:04:40,320
SAM: A small electronic device.

1650
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:43,077
MARISHA: Yes. That kind of bug.

1651
02:04:43,077 --> 02:04:44,951
MATT: Make a perception check.

1652
02:04:44,951 --> 02:04:48,377
MARISHA: Not bad. 26.

1653
02:04:48,377 --> 02:04:55,179
MATT: Looking around the room, there doesn't appear
to be any specific devices installed, whether

1654
02:04:55,228 --> 02:04:58,172
magical or otherwise, that would pertain to
immediate--

1655
02:04:58,172 --> 02:05:00,071
TRAVIS: No blue poo. Got it.

1656
02:05:00,071 --> 02:05:03,477
LAURA: (whispering) Lean in, girl. Lean in.

1657
02:05:03,477 --> 02:05:06,979
MATT: She leans in a little bit and goes, "Hold
on." And she runs off behind the counter. Heads

1658
02:05:06,979 --> 02:05:11,961
back and closes the doors behind where you guys
entered. Heads back and gets behind the counter.

1659
02:05:11,961 --> 02:05:18,947
"I'm sorry. I don't recognize any of you, and
you're bringing up rather dangerous statements.

1660
02:05:18,947 --> 02:05:27,456
"What can I help you with? We don't have much." And
she reaches down and pulls out a couple of small

1661
02:05:27,456 --> 02:05:33,079
glass vials. Simple healing potions, you can
already see. You've worked with these type of

1662
02:05:33,079 --> 02:05:34,727
things before.

1663
02:05:34,727 --> 02:05:39,770
TALIESIN: We're actually looking for something a
bit more complicated and a little more dangerous.

1664
02:05:39,770 --> 02:05:44,789
MATT: She pulls up a small metal rod. "One of
these?"

1665
02:05:44,789 --> 02:05:54,834
TALIESIN: I don't know what that is. Let me show
you. And I'm going to walk over to the wall, find

1666
02:05:54,834 --> 02:05:58,896
a dusty wall, and I'm going to trace the symbol on
the wall.

1667
02:05:58,896 --> 02:06:05,528
MATT: Okay. She gives you a look and says, "It's
dangerous to draw that around here, sir."

1668
02:06:05,528 --> 02:06:07,475
TALIESIN: I'm going to wipe it away.

1669
02:06:07,475 --> 02:06:12,570
MATT: She gets a little more comfortable as soon
as you do. "What are you doing here?"

1670
02:06:12,570 --> 02:06:18,283
TALIESIN: We're hoping that we could purchase a
brief amount of sanctuary.

1671
02:06:18,283 --> 02:06:22,263
MATT: "Here? Why?"

1672
02:06:22,263 --> 02:06:26,617
TALIESIN: We need to keep moving so that they
don't catch us.

1673
02:06:26,617 --> 02:06:33,761
MATT: "The Briarwoods are after you? I can't have
you here! You'll bring them right to me!"

1674
02:06:33,761 --> 02:06:45,926
LAURA: Dear, the Briarwoods aren't after us.
They're after everybody. What we need is a place

1675
02:06:45,926 --> 02:06:49,177
to stay that we know is protected.

1676
02:06:49,177 --> 02:06:53,037
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

1677
02:06:53,037 --> 02:07:04,273
LAURA: (growls) Eight is-- 16.

1678
02:07:04,273 --> 02:07:07,974
SAM: 80 60?

1679
02:07:07,974 --> 02:07:09,179
LAURA: 80 60.

1680
02:07:09,179 --> 02:07:11,338
MATT: Yes, big number. It's a very large die.

1681
02:07:11,338 --> 02:07:14,072
TALIESIN: Can I try and pour on top of it?

1682
02:07:14,072 --> 02:07:20,707
MATT: I'd say no. Not at this point. You're the
one that originally spurred her worry. She gives

1683
02:07:20,754 --> 02:07:29,864
you a look. "Look, if I'm going to let you stay
here, I need to know more about what it is that

1684
02:07:29,864 --> 02:07:34,633
"you're trying to accomplish here. Raising the
symbol of the de Rolos? I've never seen any of you

1685
02:07:34,633 --> 02:07:36,438
"in the city before in my life."

1686
02:07:36,438 --> 02:07:39,312
LAURA: Do you miss the de Rolos, dear?

1687
02:07:39,312 --> 02:07:42,242
MATT: "Anything's better than this misery."

1688
02:07:42,242 --> 02:07:50,833
LAURA: Well, we may know a couple de Rolos. We
may know some. No big deal.

1689
02:07:50,869 --> 02:07:52,593
MARISHA: It's true.

1690
02:07:52,593 --> 02:07:58,288
MATT: She shakes her head and, "Foolish minds. The
de Rolos have been dead for five years."

1691
02:07:58,288 --> 02:07:59,894
TALIESIN: Not all of them.

1692
02:07:59,894 --> 02:08:01,758
MATT: "Really?"

1693
02:08:01,758 --> 02:08:04,496
TALIESIN: I can't drop the Seeming, can I?

1694
02:08:04,496 --> 02:08:06,315
MARISHA: (laughing) No, you're stuck.

1695
02:08:06,315 --> 02:08:08,366
TRAVIS: Just drop that phat name of yours, buddy.

1696
02:08:08,366 --> 02:08:16,850
LAURA: Only one person would know the entire name
of Percival de Rolo.

1697
02:08:16,850 --> 02:08:20,945
MARISHA: Miss, do you know the full name of
Percival de Rolo?

1698
02:08:20,945 --> 02:08:24,252
TALIESIN: I was wondering if you were about to do
it. Can you do it?

1699
02:08:24,252 --> 02:08:26,035
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's Museldorf Musketeers--

1700
02:08:26,035 --> 02:08:27,844
SAM: Percival Sanchez Vicario--

1701
02:08:27,844 --> 02:08:30,933
LAURA: de Rolo III.

1702
02:08:30,933 --> 02:08:33,886
LIAM: The Nina, the Pinta, the Santa Maria.

1703
02:08:33,886 --> 02:08:38,912
MARISHA: Percival Von Musel Von Lichtenstein de
Rolo III.

1704
02:08:38,912 --> 02:08:41,274
SAM: Kevin Dorff, Wesley Snipes.

1705
02:08:41,274 --> 02:08:44,083
LAURA: Magneto de Rolo III.

1706
02:08:44,083 --> 02:08:45,735
MARISHA: de Rolo III.

1707
02:08:45,735 --> 02:08:52,648
MATT: This moment of tension with Jordana
awkwardly staring at these all very

1708
02:08:52,648 --> 02:08:58,558
intently looking dirty peasants. With a donkey.
Just talking about names.

1709
02:08:58,558 --> 02:09:04,761
TALIESIN: Simon Whisk was a good friend to
Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de

1710
02:09:04,761 --> 02:09:06,047
Rolo III.

1711
02:09:06,047 --> 02:09:07,234
MARISHA: That's it.

1712
02:09:07,234 --> 02:09:09,615
TALIESIN: Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel
Klossowski de Rolo III.

1713
02:09:09,615 --> 02:09:11,885
MARISHA: Percival Fredricks Von Stein--

1714
02:09:11,885 --> 02:09:13,711
TRAVIS: You can call him Percy.

1715
02:09:13,711 --> 02:09:16,790
TALIESIN: Percival lives, and he's coming.

1716
02:09:16,790 --> 02:09:24,511
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

1717
02:09:24,511 --> 02:09:54,641
[no audio]

1718
02:09:54,641 --> 02:10:00,991
MATT: And one you're not sure the nature of, and
says, "Take these." And she pushes them ahead to

1719
02:10:00,991 --> 02:10:08,529
you. "It's not much." Two regular healing potions,
one greater healing potion. She explains what the

1720
02:10:08,529 --> 02:10:16,628
metal thing is. She picks it up and clicks part of
the metal cusp of it, and it stays in the air on

1721
02:10:16,628 --> 02:10:18,071
its own.

1722
02:10:18,071 --> 02:10:20,488
MARISHA: Oh my god! It's another Rod of Holding.

1723
02:10:20,488 --> 02:10:22,718
MATT: Immovable Rod, but yes.

1724
02:10:22,718 --> 02:10:27,105
MARISHA: Immovable Rod. That one. I was combining
Bag of Holding and the Immovable Rod.

1725
02:10:27,105 --> 02:10:28,287
Combining them.

1726
02:10:28,287 --> 02:10:29,687
SAM: What's a movable rod?

1727
02:10:29,687 --> 02:10:33,182
LAURA: Two greater healing and then another
regular?

1728
02:10:33,182 --> 02:10:34,414
MATT: One greater healing and two regular.

1729
02:10:34,414 --> 02:10:36,781
LIAM: It's like a ladder rung that you can put
wherever you want and hang on it.

1730
02:10:36,781 --> 02:10:38,283
SAM: Did we already have one of those?

1731
02:10:38,283 --> 02:10:39,313
MARISHA: Yeah, we did.

1732
02:10:39,313 --> 02:10:40,647
SAM: What happened to it?

1733
02:10:40,647 --> 02:10:45,456
MARISHA: Tiberius put it somewhere, and it never
came back.

1734
02:10:45,456 --> 02:10:46,805
SAM: He put it on the magic carpet?

1735
02:10:46,805 --> 02:10:50,851
MARISHA: He might have. Tiberius had one. We
didn't use it much.

1736
02:10:50,851 --> 02:10:52,466
LIAM: He's a mysterious motherfucker.

1737
02:10:52,466 --> 02:11:00,177
MATT: All right. She pushes it all towards you
guys and says, "I have practically no one, and I

1738
02:11:00,177 --> 02:11:02,374
"can't be much help. I'm not a fighter."

1739
02:11:02,426 --> 02:11:04,095
MARISHA: I'll take the rod.

1740
02:11:04,095 --> 02:11:05,358
MATT: All right.

1741
02:11:05,358 --> 02:11:10,176
TALIESIN: I will make sure that you are
compensated when this is over. Can we sleep here

1742
02:11:10,176 --> 02:11:11,821
for the night?

1743
02:11:11,821 --> 02:11:17,441
MATT: "Follow me." She leads you to the back, and
there's this very, very small room that looks like

1744
02:11:17,441 --> 02:11:24,113
it used to be her father's room. It's dusty. Most
of it has been untouched, except for the bed. She

1745
02:11:24,113 --> 02:11:30,646
walks in. "This is all I have to offer. It's not
much, but it's available."

1746
02:11:30,646 --> 02:11:32,403
LAURA: Is it safe at night?

1747
02:11:32,403 --> 02:11:35,398
MATT: "As safe as anything is here. Just don't go
outside."

1748
02:11:35,398 --> 02:11:37,186
TRAVIS: What does the ceiling look like?

1749
02:11:37,186 --> 02:11:47,301
MATT: It's about nine feet up. Maybe about two
feet of rafters. Very simple. Very plain.

1750
02:11:47,301 --> 02:11:50,440
TRAVIS: That's where we need to be tonight.
Remember when we were in the branches?

1751
02:11:50,440 --> 02:11:54,354
LAURA: Can I insight check her and see if she
seems to be truthful?

1752
02:11:54,354 --> 02:11:56,313
MATT: Sure, go for it.

1753
02:11:56,313 --> 02:12:03,865
LAURA: I never know which one. It's too much
pressure to choose. That was the wrong one. I

1754
02:12:03,865 --> 02:12:06,662
chose poorly. 13.

1755
02:12:06,662 --> 02:12:16,720
MATT: Okay. It's hard to tell. She's young, and
she seems definitely earnest and plain with her

1756
02:12:16,720 --> 02:12:21,902
forthrightness. Yeah, there doesn't appear to be
any sort of deception.

1757
02:12:21,902 --> 02:12:32,405
TRAVIS: We are allies. With us comes change. Keep
our secret and all the better we'll be for it.

1758
02:12:32,458 --> 02:12:41,303
MATT: "It's kept, but I recommend talking to
Keeper Yennen if you haven't. He's one of the

1759
02:12:41,303 --> 02:12:46,693
"social centerpieces of the remaining good folk in
the city."

1760
02:12:46,693 --> 02:12:50,019
TALIESIN: We have spoken to him. We will speak to
him again today.

1761
02:12:50,019 --> 02:12:55,479
MATT: His reach is far. He'd be the one to talk
to. Well, don't stay here long. That will draw

1762
02:12:55,479 --> 02:12:56,828
attention.

1763
02:12:56,828 --> 02:13:02,311
MARISHA: Also, we're going to have two more
staying with us, if that's okay.

1764
02:13:02,311 --> 02:13:04,515
LAURA: One's a child, though. You won't even
notice him.

1765
02:13:04,515 --> 02:13:12,167
MATT: Her shoulders slump a little bit. She's
like, "All right. I'll prepare as best I can." And

1766
02:13:12,167 --> 02:13:17,639
she starts reaching over and starts pulling these
thin blankets out from a nearby cabinet and goes,

1767
02:13:17,639 --> 02:13:19,203
"Well? Go!"

1768
02:13:19,203 --> 02:13:26,096
TALIESIN: Good day. Everyone, let's meet over at
the Lady's Chamber once you're finished with your

1769
02:13:26,096 --> 02:13:27,288
business.

1770
02:13:27,288 --> 02:13:29,261
MATT: All right, now you guys.

1771
02:13:29,261 --> 02:13:32,791
LIAM: I'm dragging you along by the scruff of the
ear.

1772
02:13:32,791 --> 02:13:34,063
SAM: Pa, please!

1773
02:13:34,063 --> 02:13:35,156
LIAM: Shut up.

1774
02:13:35,156 --> 02:13:36,215
SAM: I'm tired.

1775
02:13:36,215 --> 02:13:39,857
LIAM: I'm going to look for anybody walking by. Is
there anyone nearby?

1776
02:13:39,857 --> 02:13:46,966
MATT: After about a minute or so of walking, you
do see what looks to be a young man carrying a

1777
02:13:46,966 --> 02:13:52,984
satchel over his shoulder. It looks like it's
filled with a few small pieces of parchment that

1778
02:13:52,984 --> 02:13:55,460
are rolled up. He's in a brisk walk somewhere.

1779
02:13:55,460 --> 02:13:59,237
LIAM: I walk right up to him and I awkwardly put a
hand on his chest, and I make sure that I flip my

1780
02:13:59,237 --> 02:14:06,517
pencil and spit as I talk and say, I need a hard
drink. I need a hard drink right now. Where?

1781
02:14:06,517 --> 02:14:15,913
MATT: "If you're looking for a drink," And he
points over down the road, and he's really put off

1782
02:14:15,913 --> 02:14:23,099
by it and is trying to keep his face out of your
breath. "You're going to look for the Journey's

1783
02:14:23,099 --> 02:14:29,805
"End. Two blocks down that way, to the right. It's
not much business during the day."

1784
02:14:29,805 --> 02:14:33,522
LIAM: I spit at his feet and I pull Scanlan by the
ear.

1785
02:14:33,522 --> 02:14:34,956
Come on, you shit.

1786
02:14:35,002 --> 02:14:38,488
SAM: (yelps) Call Child Protective Services!

1787
02:14:38,488 --> 02:14:43,960
MATT: As you walk away, you hear him mutter under
his breath, "What's this world coming to?" And he

1788
02:14:44,071 --> 02:14:45,640
continues on his brusque pace.

1789
02:14:45,640 --> 02:14:48,328
LIAM: I'm following his directions and going
there. Journey's End, yeah.

1790
02:14:48,328 --> 02:14:53,648
MATT: You are now at the Journey's End tavern.
It's pretty barren. You walk inside. There are two

1791
02:14:53,648 --> 02:14:57,371
employees. One who is behind the bar and is
currently reading through a book. The second is

1792
02:14:57,371 --> 02:15:02,347
currently pouring a drink for the one patron
that's in there, what looks to be a

1793
02:15:02,347 --> 02:15:06,954
slovenly looking gentleman who's sitting at a
table drinking his woes away. He's currently going

1794
02:15:06,954 --> 02:15:15,849
through what looks like a ledger of some kind, and
there's a tavern employee with an apron on. He's

1795
02:15:15,849 --> 02:15:21,610
this younger, red-headed boy, who's trying to fill
a flagon while this gentleman at the table is

1796
02:15:21,610 --> 02:15:24,507
cursing at him to the side. Other than that, it's
empty.

1797
02:15:24,507 --> 02:15:25,957
LIAM: Empty. So how many in here?

1798
02:15:25,957 --> 02:15:26,805
MATT: Three.

1799
02:15:26,805 --> 02:15:32,965
LIAM: Three. All right, I pull Jimmy-John after
me, and sit down next to one of them.

1800
02:15:32,965 --> 02:15:34,802
SAM: My name is Tad.

1801
02:15:34,802 --> 02:15:50,016
LIAM: Shut up! Your mother's going to kill us
both. (sighs) Two! Two here, and a water for him.

1802
02:15:50,016 --> 02:15:54,576
MATT: "All right. Okay, I'll be right back," and
he walks off, looking a little confused.

1803
02:15:54,576 --> 02:15:57,749
SAM: I'll have one of what he's having, as well.

1804
02:15:57,749 --> 02:16:03,350
MATT: (chuckles) "That's cute. Water it is." And
he's walking off.

1805
02:16:03,350 --> 02:16:06,902
LIAM: I swat him in the back of the head for the
bartender to see.

1806
02:16:06,902 --> 02:16:14,892
MATT: The patron now, a closer look: man in his
late forties. Has a protruded jawline, little bit

1807
02:16:14,892 --> 02:16:21,107
of an underbite. Thinning brown hair, and he's got
some smears of dirt on his face. Looks like he's

1808
02:16:21,107 --> 02:16:26,341
been crying, and is slumped over the table,
looking over this ledger. He slams it shut as you

1809
02:16:26,341 --> 02:16:33,938
sit down with a very, very loud (impact noise).
Glances sidelong towards you and says, "What the

1810
02:16:33,938 --> 02:16:37,922
"fuck are you doing coming and bothering a man in
the middle of his meal?"

1811
02:16:37,922 --> 02:16:46,277
LIAM: Can't fucking earn a living in this land.
Come up from a mile out of town, been trying to

1812
02:16:46,277 --> 02:16:52,507
grow fucking carrots for these fucking people.
Can't earn a living!

1813
02:16:52,507 --> 02:16:56,715
MATT: "You're telling me. Ain't no living to be
had in Whitestone these days.

1814
02:16:56,715 --> 02:16:59,316
"It's nothing but misery."

1815
02:16:59,316 --> 02:17:07,238
LIAM: Something's got to change here. I can't
live. I can't give them what they want. I can't

1816
02:17:07,238 --> 02:17:11,311
feed him. What are we fucking supposed to do
here?

1817
02:17:11,311 --> 02:17:13,776
SAM: I haven't eaten in three days.

1818
02:17:13,776 --> 02:17:18,969
MATT: "That's the worst fucking part, is you know
there's always an easy exit."

1819
02:17:18,969 --> 02:17:21,337
SAM: What?

1820
02:17:21,388 --> 02:17:27,535
MATT: "What, you think the folks who've taken
their life to this point? You think that's the

1821
02:17:27,535 --> 02:17:33,711
"end, but no, not in this town. No, they just get
right back up the next day. There is no way out."

1822
02:17:33,711 --> 02:17:36,518
LIAM: The fuck are you talking about?

1823
02:17:36,518 --> 02:17:41,929
MATT: "Talking about the whole business. There is
no escaping this misery. Either you try and stay

1824
02:17:41,929 --> 02:17:49,171
"alive and exist in this bullshit, or you die and
become one of them. I've been trying to find a way

1825
02:17:49,171 --> 02:17:53,487
"out of this city for months now, but they're
always watching."

1826
02:17:53,487 --> 02:18:01,677
LIAM: I take a huge drink of the mug in front of
me. (sighs) Someone should run these fuckers out

1827
02:18:01,677 --> 02:18:03,131
of town.

1828
02:18:03,131 --> 02:18:06,792
MATT: "That ain't going to happen, mate. Sorry."

1829
02:18:06,792 --> 02:18:14,970
SAM: I have a friend named Kevin. He says there is
someone trying to do something about it. He says

1830
02:18:14,970 --> 02:18:20,939
that that's what caused that fire yesterday, over
at that big fancy house.

1831
02:18:20,939 --> 02:18:23,515
He says there's rebels afoot!

1832
02:18:23,515 --> 02:18:32,485
LIAM: I take the mug that I have, and I pour the
rest of it out on this little one's head and say,

1833
02:18:32,485 --> 02:18:35,085
you speak when you're spoken to.

1834
02:18:35,085 --> 02:18:40,490
MATT: "No, it's okay. Let the boy speak. Let your
boy speak! What were you saying?"

1835
02:18:40,490 --> 02:18:48,536
SAM: Oh, I'm just saying what I overheard. My
friend Kevin, he's truthful. When he lies, his

1836
02:18:48,536 --> 02:18:57,758
papa beats him, so I believe him. He said that
someone really strong took out someone who was at

1837
02:18:57,758 --> 02:19:03,451
that big fancy house that was all aflame the other
day. He said that there's lots of them, and that

1838
02:19:03,451 --> 02:19:07,186
they're going to free us all from this hell we
live in!

1839
02:19:07,186 --> 02:19:16,592
MATT: (laughing) Man, that's a layered check. Make
a persuasion and a deception roll, back to back.

1840
02:19:16,592 --> 02:19:21,191
SAM: Wait, two rolls?

1841
02:19:21,191 --> 02:19:22,248
MATT: Yes.

1842
02:19:22,248 --> 02:19:24,764
TRAVIS: It was that good.

1843
02:19:24,764 --> 02:19:33,708
SAM: Okay, persuasion and deception, you say. Oh
Jesus. Okay, persuasion. 39.

1844
02:19:33,708 --> 02:19:36,502
(laughter)

1845
02:19:36,502 --> 02:19:37,586
TALIESIN: What?!

1846
02:19:37,586 --> 02:19:40,592
LAURA: How?! Is that even possible?

1847
02:19:40,592 --> 02:19:47,913
SAM: Deception, 15. Wait, or 29. It's a lot.

1848
02:19:47,913 --> 02:19:49,799
MATT: What's your bonus?!

1849
02:19:49,799 --> 02:19:51,485
SAM: No, it's 16 plus 13.

1850
02:19:51,485 --> 02:19:52,957
MATT: Okay, so 29.

1851
02:19:52,957 --> 02:19:54,837
SAM: That's 29. Sorry. It's a lot.

1852
02:19:54,837 --> 02:20:08,410
MATT: I was like, (explosion sounds). All right.
Gives you a stern look. "Huh. Well, it'd be nice,

1853
02:20:08,410 --> 02:20:14,686
for a change, that there'd be someone up to
fucking fight for this shithole of a place."

1854
02:20:14,686 --> 02:20:17,721
LIAM: I start fake-weeping into my cup.

1855
02:20:17,721 --> 02:20:27,231
MATT: He goes, "Oh no. No need for that. Going to
make me lose my appetite. Hate the sound of a

1856
02:20:27,231 --> 02:20:30,403
"grown man crying. Chin up!" And he takes and
flicks a coin at your face.

1857
02:20:30,403 --> 02:20:31,969
LIAM: Ow, fuck!

1858
02:20:31,969 --> 02:20:38,724
MATT: "Look, if what he's saying's true, and we've
got some sort of savior making their way into

1859
02:20:38,724 --> 02:20:44,357
"town, well. Let's hope they're at least a little
more prepared than the last ones."

1860
02:20:44,357 --> 02:20:48,184
SAM: The last ones?

1861
02:20:48,184 --> 02:20:53,370
MATT: "The uprising three years ago. Are you new
to this fucking town?"

1862
02:20:53,370 --> 02:21:00,314
SAM: Three years ago, Papa wouldn't let me out of
the closet, so I didn't hear much of what was

1863
02:21:00,314 --> 02:21:01,194
going on.

1864
02:21:01,194 --> 02:21:07,116
MATT: "Okay, first and foremost, you've got to
treat your boy better. Going to raise someone no

1865
02:21:07,116 --> 02:21:10,998
"better than the motherfuckers running Whitestone
right now if you keep this up."

1866
02:21:10,998 --> 02:21:13,150
LIAM: (retches)

1867
02:21:13,150 --> 02:21:19,003
LAURA: Did you really puke, or did you fake puke?

1868
02:21:19,003 --> 02:21:27,397
SAM: I'm sorry about my papa. He's had such a hard
time these last few years. Our crops are not

1869
02:21:27,397 --> 02:21:42,324
performing well, and he's under a lot of pressure.
And I think Mama doesn't love him anymore. I'm

1870
02:21:42,324 --> 02:21:44,417
sorry. We can go.

1871
02:21:44,417 --> 02:21:53,902
MATT: "I think you should. But one thing: if he
ever does anything else to hurt you again, you

1872
02:21:53,902 --> 02:22:03,210
"come tell someone. Two: if you hear anything else
about this savior coming into town, go ahead and

1873
02:22:03,210 --> 02:22:06,198
"talk to Trevor over there, at the edge of the
bar." And you see over there, there's the guy

1874
02:22:06,198 --> 02:22:09,657
who's behind the bar with his book. He doesn't
even notice all this happening. Guy in his

1875
02:22:09,657 --> 02:22:14,652
mid-thirties, glasses at the end of his nose, his
hair's slicked back and pulled into a taut

1876
02:22:14,652 --> 02:22:20,979
ponytail, and he's sitting there reading. And he
says, "Go ahead and tell Trevor, because the rest

1877
02:22:20,979 --> 02:22:24,999
"of us would like to go out in a blaze of glory than
live in this bullshit."

1878
02:22:25,061 --> 02:22:27,517
SAM: What was your name, sir?

1879
02:22:27,517 --> 02:22:30,806
MATT: "Not important to much, but you can call me
Patrick."

1880
02:22:30,806 --> 02:22:36,621
SAM: Thank you, Patrick. I don't know if my papa
has enough money for these drinks.

1881
02:22:36,621 --> 02:22:38,699
LIAM: I'm going to insight check Patrick.

1882
02:22:38,699 --> 02:22:40,147
SAM: From the floor?

1883
02:22:40,147 --> 02:22:43,099
MATT: He's listening in. Go for it.

1884
02:22:43,099 --> 02:22:46,337
LIAM: All right, that's not that great. That's a
17.

1885
02:22:46,337 --> 02:22:55,149
MATT: He seems honest. Seems he's got not much to
lose and his interest is piqued, but he's not

1886
02:22:55,149 --> 02:23:03,685
wholly invested in this whole idea. But it's
definitely caught his attention. "Well, let's get

1887
02:23:03,685 --> 02:23:09,293
"him up." Stands up, reaches over and grabs you by
the arm, lifts you up onto the stool on the side

1888
02:23:09,293 --> 02:23:16,600
of the table and says, "Up, you." Pats you on the
back. "You need to sober up, drink the water you

1889
02:23:16,600 --> 02:23:20,616
"got for your boy, there, and get your ass out of
here."

1890
02:23:20,616 --> 02:23:25,788
SAM: Come on, Papa. Let's go. I turn around and I
take the rest of his drink.

1891
02:23:25,788 --> 02:23:27,960
(laughter)

1892
02:23:27,960 --> 02:23:42,242
LIAM: And as he pulls me away, and I slovenly turn
after him. I turn back for a second, and I

1893
02:23:42,242 --> 02:23:54,375
completely sober up. Pelor has returned.

1894
02:23:54,375 --> 02:23:57,079
Walked out.

1895
02:23:57,079 --> 02:24:05,474
MATT: He gives you a keen glance and nods slowly
as you walk away. Looks over at the bartender for

1896
02:24:05,522 --> 02:24:14,143
a second, and, "Psst! Trevor!" And then you exit
the building. All right, you guys all convene at

1897
02:24:14,143 --> 02:24:21,432
the Lady's Chamber. The other day, there were a
few folks walking through the courtyard. Today,

1898
02:24:21,432 --> 02:24:28,597
there's a group of about 25 people, all different
dress, from what would be considered a Whitestone

1899
02:24:28,597 --> 02:24:35,830
middle class, the few there are, to a number of
other peasantry, farmhands, and other folk that

1900
02:24:35,830 --> 02:24:41,466
look destitute by nature of existence here. All
gathered in the amphitheater, and what appears to

1901
02:24:41,466 --> 02:24:47,520
be a relatively hushed sermon or discussion
currently going on by Keeper Yennen.

1902
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:53,911
MARISHA: Let's not make ourselves known. I want to
see this. I want to hear what's up.

1903
02:24:53,911 --> 02:24:55,080
TALIESIN: Sit in the back.

1904
02:24:55,080 --> 02:25:03,875
MATT: Okay, sit in the back. He begins talking for
a while about a long tangent, speaking of, "This

1905
02:25:03,875 --> 02:25:15,321
"land, once cherished, is a burning light and a
beacon of good existence, of kinship, of honesty

1906
02:25:15,321 --> 02:25:24,906
"and loyalty, dragged down to the muck by the
imposition of darkness, the return of the evil

1907
02:25:24,906 --> 02:25:33,466
"that once scourged this land. Now given new faces,
they push us down, and as hope crumbles, the light

1908
02:25:33,466 --> 02:25:39,151
"peeks through once again, for whispers have come
to my ears, friends, that this unrest now has a

1909
02:25:39,151 --> 02:25:46,642
"name. I'm sure you've seen it, the fire atop that
building this morning, watched as one of your

1910
02:25:46,767 --> 02:25:58,509
"oppressors was cut from his high throne. One of
his close advisors scarred, tortured, shown the

1911
02:25:58,509 --> 02:26:04,169
"strength of this hidden ally of us, the oppressed
peoples of Whitestone." And he looks up over the

1912
02:26:04,169 --> 02:26:14,233
group a little bit and past the streets, carefully.
"I have come to believe that perhaps this is the

1913
02:26:14,299 --> 02:26:22,630
"time for us to band together and show our support.
Now, the information is still vague, but just keep

1914
02:26:22,630 --> 02:26:34,393
"your eyes open. Be careful, be quiet. As things
progress, word will find you." Bows his head and

1915
02:26:34,393 --> 02:26:39,551
says a prayer that-- none of you speak Celestial?

1916
02:26:39,551 --> 02:26:41,598
TALIESIN: I do.

1917
02:26:41,598 --> 02:26:43,222
SAM: You do?!

1918
02:26:43,222 --> 02:26:44,725
TALIESIN: I speak Celestial.

1919
02:26:44,725 --> 02:26:53,911
MATT: All righty. The essence of the prayer is: By
the guidance of the Lady, may civilization

1920
02:26:53,911 --> 02:27:02,705
flourish and those that keep progression at bay be
squashed beneath our feet. At which point the

1921
02:27:02,705 --> 02:27:05,431
sermon breaks, and people begin to walk away and
scatter.

1922
02:27:05,431 --> 02:27:11,310
LAURA: I want to watch people as they walk away
and try to read their lips as they're walking away

1923
02:27:11,310 --> 02:27:15,091
to see if everybody seems loyal to what he said,
or if anybody seems a little--

1924
02:27:15,091 --> 02:27:22,486
MATT: Everyone is silent. Everyone is quiet, and
everyone is looking warily and making their own

1925
02:27:22,486 --> 02:27:26,305
separate paced exits, so as not to draw
attention.

1926
02:27:26,305 --> 02:27:29,410
LAURA: Can we try to memorize their faces? Of
everybody that was here?

1927
02:27:29,410 --> 02:27:36,983
MATT: Okay. You keep as best a mental image of
everyone who's passing by. Not too many notable

1928
02:27:36,983 --> 02:27:43,184
folk. They look like, especially where you're
from, the peasantry doesn't really interest you

1929
02:27:43,184 --> 02:27:46,984
visually, but you do manage to gather details of
certain scars here and there, and people, hair

1930
02:27:46,984 --> 02:27:48,962
color, age, stuff like that.

1931
02:27:48,962 --> 02:27:51,029
TRAVIS: Did we recognize the guy that was
talking?

1932
02:27:51,029 --> 02:27:52,512
LAURA: Yeah, that was Keeper.

1933
02:27:52,512 --> 02:27:53,948
MATT: Keeper Yennen.

1934
02:27:53,948 --> 02:27:57,106
MARISHA: Yeah. Any familiar faces in the
audience?

1935
02:27:57,106 --> 02:28:05,470
MATT: Actually, Scanlan, you and Keyleth both
recognize some of the farmers. You guys have all

1936
02:28:05,470 --> 02:28:06,576
gathered.

1937
02:28:06,576 --> 02:28:08,097
SAM: Oh, we gathered again. Okay.

1938
02:28:08,097 --> 02:28:13,092
MATT: You recognize two of the individuals at this
were the farmers you initially saw on the

1939
02:28:13,092 --> 02:28:15,604
outskirts of Whitestone when you did your little
scouting mission earlier.

1940
02:28:15,604 --> 02:28:19,100
SAM: Oh, nice. When we flew in?

1941
02:28:19,100 --> 02:28:20,082
MATT: Yeah.

1942
02:28:20,082 --> 02:28:21,031
SAM: Okay.

1943
02:28:21,031 --> 02:28:25,466
MATT: So from all the people you've encountered,
those are the only two that you specifically

1944
02:28:25,511 --> 02:28:28,419
recognize so far, but it does appear to be made up
of--

1945
02:28:28,419 --> 02:28:30,456
MARISHA: Working hands, farmers.

1946
02:28:30,456 --> 02:28:34,302
MATT: Yeah, the foundation of this city that have
been so long oppressed.

1947
02:28:34,302 --> 02:28:38,682
TRAVIS: I elbow Percy, and I go, do we talk to
him?

1948
02:28:38,682 --> 02:28:47,146
TALIESIN: I think we do. Maybe he talks to us. I
try and catch his attention.

1949
02:28:47,146 --> 02:28:52,285
MATT: Okay. You can see as he begins putting out
some of the incense, he looks over and sees, "Ah,

1950
02:28:52,285 --> 02:29:00,251
"yes. You've returned. Please, follow me." And he
steps outside of the amphitheater and around the

1951
02:29:00,251 --> 02:29:01,635
back of it.

1952
02:29:01,635 --> 02:29:03,280
TALIESIN: We follow.

1953
02:29:03,280 --> 02:29:09,283
MATT: Okay. Around the back of the amphitheater,
you see there is constructed, attached to the very

1954
02:29:09,283 --> 02:29:18,751
far end of this round half-dome, a square brick
building. Very simple. And as he ushers you all

1955
02:29:18,751 --> 02:29:28,088
inside, it's essentially a tea room. There's a
table, there's a tea set up there, there is a

1956
02:29:28,088 --> 02:29:33,402
small stove in the far end with a little
fire-burning stove, and shelves and shelves and

1957
02:29:33,402 --> 02:29:42,338
shelves arranged with all different manner of
small sculptures, metalwork, holy symbols of

1958
02:29:42,338 --> 02:29:47,066
Erathis that have all been put on display. Each
one has a name carved beneath it. And you

1959
02:29:47,066 --> 02:29:55,343
recognize this, Percy. This is the legacy of all
the Keepers of the Lady's Chamber over time, their

1960
02:29:55,343 --> 02:30:03,045
symbols. This is basically a Hall of Previous
Keepers. "Please, sit. Have tea if you like, if

1961
02:30:03,045 --> 02:30:12,775
"you're so interested. We have much to discuss. So.
I am to believe that these allies you spoke of

1962
02:30:12,775 --> 02:30:21,501
"previously were responsible for this dastardly
attack on Sir Kerrion?"

1963
02:30:21,501 --> 02:30:23,881
TALIESIN: That could be inferred.

1964
02:30:23,881 --> 02:30:31,787
MATT: "Well, I have spoken privately with a number
of the remaining community leaders of our town,

1965
02:30:31,853 --> 02:30:37,738
"and they are unconvinced. Understand, this isn't
the first time an insurrection has been attempted,

1966
02:30:37,738 --> 02:30:45,548
"and much sorrow was endured after previous
failures. We keep hope best we can, but without a

1967
02:30:45,548 --> 02:30:50,790
"solid plan, we are sending the rest of our
able-bodied into the abyss."

1968
02:30:50,790 --> 02:30:53,548
TALIESIN: What happened last time?

1969
02:30:53,548 --> 02:31:02,228
MATT: "Well, in a similar fashion, we had a number
of fed-up individuals decide to finally raise some

1970
02:31:02,228 --> 02:31:08,983
"sort of aggressive act against the castle and
attempt to storm it by force. We figured we had

1971
02:31:08,983 --> 02:31:16,834
"the numbers. There are many dangers in that castle
that go beyond what we were prepared for. As such,

1972
02:31:16,834 --> 02:31:24,395
"the few that survived, well. They met the fate
most do at the Sun Tree these days. So we've been

1973
02:31:24,395 --> 02:31:32,867
"remiss to put ourselves in a similar position for
many years now. To make matters worse, our

1974
02:31:32,867 --> 02:31:36,694
"informant within the castle has gone silent these
past few weeks. We have no idea of the progression

1975
02:31:36,694 --> 02:31:38,782
"of the Briarwoods' plot."

1976
02:31:38,782 --> 02:31:42,135
MARISHA: Was your informant by chance named
Simon?

1977
02:31:42,135 --> 02:31:45,667
MATT: "No. Simon has been missing for some time,
actually."

1978
02:31:45,667 --> 02:31:49,828
TALIESIN: Who was your informant?

1979
02:31:49,828 --> 02:31:56,874
MATT: "I don't know the name. The information
comes through-- actually, he should be arriving

1980
02:31:56,874 --> 02:31:59,259
"here in just a moment."

1981
02:31:59,259 --> 02:32:02,685
TALIESIN: What did they find underneath
Whitestone?

1982
02:32:02,685 --> 02:32:08,418
MATT: "All that we know is they've been rebuilding
or repurposing something old and terrible beneath

1983
02:32:08,418 --> 02:32:12,568
"the city. I've only heard whispers of it referred
to as the ziggurat."

1984
02:32:12,568 --> 02:32:15,051
LAURA, TRAVIS, and MARISHA: The ziggurat.

1985
02:32:15,051 --> 02:32:21,964
MATT: "Now, to go into the deep history of this
city, as you are outsiders, legend speaks of a

1986
02:32:21,964 --> 02:32:30,503
"seed, that the Sun Tree was placed by Pelor
himself to seal a wound in the light. Whitestone

1987
02:32:30,503 --> 02:32:37,251
"rose around it. The fable has long been told, but
ever since those fiends took the city, their

1988
02:32:37,251 --> 02:32:46,544
"interest beneath the city has kept me thinking on
this fable. Leaves me very unsettled. And as the

1989
02:32:46,544 --> 02:32:52,432
"Sun Tree slowly died, so did our confidence.
Further--"

1990
02:32:52,432 --> 02:33:01,343
At which point, the door across the room opens.
(creak) And another enters the room. A very

1991
02:33:01,343 --> 02:33:09,131
elderly man steps in, his ragged robes draped on
his very thin, frail form.

1992
02:33:09,131 --> 02:33:11,189
LAURA: I wink at him.

1993
02:33:11,189 --> 02:33:17,424
MATT: His weathered skin is dark and leathery.
He's nearly hairless on his head and has liver

1994
02:33:17,424 --> 02:33:23,882
spots all over his scalp. One of his eyes is
clouded over and white. He shimmies in very

1995
02:33:23,882 --> 02:33:35,765
slowly. "I ask you strangers, what makes you so
sure you can change the tide of this battle?"

1996
02:33:35,765 --> 02:33:38,620
TRAVIS: (whispers) Drop Seeming. Drop it.

1997
02:33:38,620 --> 02:33:41,180
TALIESIN: Do I recognize this person?

1998
02:33:41,180 --> 02:33:46,010
MATT: As old as he may be, there is a subtle power
and resonance and confidence to his voice. There's

1999
02:33:46,010 --> 02:33:51,725
a force of personality and conviction that
immediately leads you to believe that this man is

2000
02:33:51,725 --> 02:33:55,853
or once was a man of great power and respect.

2001
02:33:55,853 --> 02:33:57,687
TRAVIS: Are there windows in the room?

2002
02:33:57,687 --> 02:34:02,128
MATT: There are two windows. They are currently
shut with curtains.

2003
02:34:02,128 --> 02:34:04,447
TRAVIS: You should show him.

2004
02:34:04,447 --> 02:34:11,698
MATT: You, Percy, recognize this man. He was once
the chancellor to your father, and a

2005
02:34:11,698 --> 02:34:15,911
long-respected philosopher in Whitestone known as
Archibald Desnae.

2006
02:34:15,911 --> 02:34:19,652
MARISHA: Archibald Desnitt?

2007
02:34:19,652 --> 02:34:29,072
MATT: Desnae. He was very well-respected. Very
stern, and crotchety at times, but very much aided

2008
02:34:29,072 --> 02:34:32,080
your family in holding the city together in times
of strife.

2009
02:34:32,080 --> 02:34:43,449
SAM: I pull out Sir Kerrion's notebook and I hand
it to them and I say, this should be some proof

2010
02:34:43,449 --> 02:34:46,029
that we mean what we say.

2011
02:34:46,029 --> 02:34:53,556
MATT: Reaches out, and his long, spindly fingers
wrap around the tome, pull it towards him. "So you

2012
02:34:53,556 --> 02:35:05,484
"bring a trinket. That is helpful. But to kill one
mortal man is no feat compared to the darkness

2013
02:35:05,484 --> 02:35:10,904
"that lies in that castle. You need more than
that."

2014
02:35:10,904 --> 02:35:14,180
TALIESIN: I remove my hat.

2015
02:35:14,180 --> 02:35:17,387
SAM: Can I drop it on one of us, or do I have to
drop it on all of us?

2016
02:35:17,387 --> 02:35:20,823
MATT: I'd say you can drop it on an individual, if
you prefer.

2017
02:35:20,823 --> 02:35:23,667
SAM: All right. I will drop Percy's Seeming.

2018
02:35:23,667 --> 02:35:33,886
MATT: Okay. There's a slamming sound as the tome
he's holding hits the floor.

2019
02:35:33,886 --> 02:35:37,926
TALIESIN: Hello, Archie.

2020
02:35:37,926 --> 02:35:43,576
MATT: "Percival? Sweet Percival."

2021
02:35:43,576 --> 02:35:46,882
TALIESIN: Not so sweet these days. I did not think
you would have lived.

2022
02:35:46,882 --> 02:35:53,929
MATT: "I thought you had perished in the
subjugation. Percival, you have no idea the joy

2023
02:35:53,929 --> 02:35:57,673
"this brings to my heart." And he reaches out and
touches the edge of your face like he's still in

2024
02:35:57,673 --> 02:36:05,362
disbelief. "Your hair. It seems age has caught up
to you, as well."

2025
02:36:05,362 --> 02:36:09,049
TALIESIN: It was difficult, leaving.

2026
02:36:09,049 --> 02:36:18,487
MATT: You see a smile creep across his very tense
old-man face, and he looks about the room with a

2027
02:36:18,487 --> 02:36:20,356
renewed energy that wasn't there before.

2028
02:36:20,356 --> 02:36:22,490
TALIESIN: My friends are strong.

2029
02:36:22,490 --> 02:36:32,358
MATT: "With you here, Percival, we've two de Rolos
spearheading the rebellion. We have the guiding

2030
02:36:32,358 --> 02:36:35,153
"light the people need."

2031
02:36:35,153 --> 02:36:38,377
TALIESIN: Who else survived?

2032
02:36:38,377 --> 02:36:46,545
MATT: "We must succeed, Percival. If this fails,
there won't be anyone else left to rise up. They

2033
02:36:46,545 --> 02:36:51,955
"are nearing their goal, according to your sister
Cassandra. We haven't much time.

2034
02:36:51,955 --> 02:36:57,589
"Your sister lives, Percival."

2035
02:36:57,589 --> 02:36:59,939
MARISHA: Oh shit!

2036
02:36:59,939 --> 02:37:05,299
MATT: "She survived the attack and was taken as
the personal assistant and slave of the Briarwoods

2037
02:37:05,299 --> 02:37:12,696
"and used as an example, a symbol of their
dominance. She has been feeding us information for

2038
02:37:12,696 --> 02:37:21,091
"years, whenever she could. She was the helping
guide, the last two attempts we've made. We have

2039
02:37:21,091 --> 02:37:27,906
"not received a letter from her in weeks now, but
know you are not the only surviving member of your

02:37:27,906 --> 02:37:41,759
"family. I will talk to your people. I will talk to
mine. We'll have your militia. Guide us, Percival

2041
02:37:41,759 --> 02:37:50,351
"Fredrickstein von Mussel Klossowski de Rolo III.
Guide us, Vox Machina."

2042
02:37:50,351 --> 02:37:54,970
SAM: Wait. You know who we are? How does he know?

2043
02:37:54,970 --> 02:38:05,312
MATT: "Some of us have information all over these
lands. We've had a few friends come from Emon over

2044
02:38:05,312 --> 02:38:12,435
"the past couple years. They met some dire ends.
Don't think that we haven't heard of your

2045
02:38:12,435 --> 02:38:17,424
"exploits. Help us bring a dawn back to this
land."

2046
02:38:17,424 --> 02:38:26,271
TALIESIN: I may have a plan. How fares Professor
Anders?

2047
02:38:26,271 --> 02:38:37,123
MATT: "Professor Anders has been lost to us since
before the insurrection. He is a man taken by what

2048
02:38:37,123 --> 02:38:43,862
"promises the Briarwoods have given him. What
little he has shown his face in this town, he is

2049
02:38:43,862 --> 02:38:47,601
"not the man he once was, or at least the man we
thought he was was never

2050
02:38:47,601 --> 02:38:49,983
"who he truly claimed to be."

2051
02:38:49,983 --> 02:38:56,203
TALIESIN: He lives in the house in the east? House
in the north?

2052
02:38:56,203 --> 02:38:59,716
MATT: "He lives in the castle with the Briarwoods,
as well."

2053
02:38:59,716 --> 02:39:07,710
TALIESIN: Lady Ripley lives in one of those
mansions.

2054
02:39:07,710 --> 02:39:18,443
MATT: "She did. There have been reports in recent
days that she's been quick to pack. We know not

2055
02:39:18,443 --> 02:39:20,575
"where she resides now."

2056
02:39:20,575 --> 02:39:24,379
TALIESIN: Who lives in the third house?

2057
02:39:24,379 --> 02:39:30,623
MATT: "Here." And he takes a moment to think of
which house you're referring to.

2058
02:39:30,623 --> 02:39:33,017
TALIESIN: We burned one of them.

2059
02:39:33,017 --> 02:39:42,189
MATT: "Yes, you did. The house is Kerrion's house,
and then there are two other homesteads of the new

2060
02:39:42,189 --> 02:39:50,016
"nobles, one of which is currently held by the
Duke," he says with disdain. "Goran Vedmeyer."

2061
02:39:50,016 --> 02:39:53,700
MARISHA: Goran Quagmire?

2062
02:39:53,700 --> 02:39:55,503
LAURA and SAM: Vedmeyer.

2063
02:39:55,503 --> 02:40:03,406
MATT: "Vedmeyer. He has supposedly been put in
watch at the temple of Pelor, but he's left that

2064
02:40:03,406 --> 02:40:13,188
"to ruin. The other home houses Count Tylieri, a
rather sadistic man who oversees the timber

2065
02:40:13,188 --> 02:40:15,955
"production of Whitestone."

2066
02:40:15,955 --> 02:40:19,523
LAURA: The what production?

2067
02:40:19,523 --> 02:40:21,169
MATT: "Timber."

2068
02:40:21,169 --> 02:40:26,756
SAM: Is that the house that the Countess was
briefly residing in?

2069
02:40:26,756 --> 02:40:28,526
MATT: "Briefly."

2070
02:40:28,526 --> 02:40:30,143
SAM: Count Tygieri?

2071
02:40:30,143 --> 02:40:31,543
MATT: "Tylieri."

2072
02:40:31,543 --> 02:40:44,017
SAM: Tylieri. How are these men, the duke and the
count? What do the people think of them?

2073
02:40:44,017 --> 02:40:51,084
MATT: "The Briarwoods, when they took Whitestone,
did not take it alone. They came to this land with

2074
02:40:51,084 --> 02:40:58,184
"a small army of cutthroats, mercenaries,
sell-swords they brought over from whichever

2075
02:40:58,184 --> 02:41:05,064
"forsaken land they came from. Each one of those
men that then proved to be of utmost use to them

2076
02:41:05,064 --> 02:41:12,100
"in that rebellion, they were given titles and
nobility and homesteads. They were given

2077
02:41:12,100 --> 02:41:17,654
"responsibilities over the land, the people beneath
them. I can only assume that was part of their

2078
02:41:17,654 --> 02:41:19,896
"payment for their service."

2079
02:41:19,896 --> 02:41:23,283
SAM: But they're just thugs who were particularly
successful.

2080
02:41:23,283 --> 02:41:25,768
MATT: "As far as I know, yes."

2081
02:41:25,768 --> 02:41:28,354
LAURA: Are they supernatural? Are they undead?

2082
02:41:28,354 --> 02:41:31,217
MATT: "Not to my knowledge."

2083
02:41:31,217 --> 02:41:37,328
TRAVIS: If we were to continue working our way up
this totem pole, which of the two is less

2084
02:41:37,328 --> 02:41:38,625
powerful?

2085
02:41:38,625 --> 02:41:42,248
TALIESIN: Which of the two is reviled most?

2086
02:41:42,248 --> 02:41:45,600
MARISHA: Yes, what would start an uprising?

2087
02:41:45,600 --> 02:41:54,356
MATT: "Count Tylieri is known for being quite the
sadistic individual. Beating, torturing his

2088
02:41:54,356 --> 02:42:02,947
"servants, sometimes publicly to show his hand to
those who would cross him. He would definitely be

2089
02:42:02,947 --> 02:42:05,744
"a message to send, if there were one."

2090
02:42:05,744 --> 02:42:07,492
TALIESIN: I have a plan.

2091
02:42:07,492 --> 02:42:09,347
SAM: I've got one, too. Kill him.

2092
02:42:09,347 --> 02:42:11,289
TALIESIN: Well, that's part of the plan.

2093
02:42:11,289 --> 02:42:21,012
MATT: "I would warn, the longer we wait making
these messages, the stronger we build this part of

2094
02:42:21,012 --> 02:42:26,865
"the city, but also the more warning and
preparation time we give to those in the castle.

2095
02:42:26,865 --> 02:42:29,704
"So the choice is yours."

2096
02:42:29,704 --> 02:42:32,601
LIAM: We act now.

2097
02:42:32,601 --> 02:42:34,288
MARISHA: Act now?

2098
02:42:34,288 --> 02:42:36,196
LAURA: Against the Briarwoods?

2099
02:42:36,196 --> 02:42:38,382
TRAVIS: Count Tylieri.

2100
02:42:38,382 --> 02:42:41,122
TALIESIN: Here's my plan.

2101
02:42:41,122 --> 02:42:52,488
MATT: The name Tylieri catches your ear's memory.
If you recall, your captive back at Greyskull Keep

2102
02:42:52,488 --> 02:42:59,583
was previously the owner of the driver of the
Briarwoods, Desmond. The one that beat him

2103
02:42:59,583 --> 02:43:05,638
senseless until eventually Lord Briarwood saw this
and then took him as his own driver.

2104
02:43:05,638 --> 02:43:21,213
SAM: I'm just a small boy, but we've seen mists at
night, strange things that come out when the sun

2105
02:43:21,213 --> 02:43:26,435
goes down. Are those focused around a central area
of town, or are those everywhere?

2106
02:43:26,435 --> 02:43:32,290
MATT: "The mists are a means of intimidation. It's
merely a magical precursor to the undead minions

2107
02:43:32,290 --> 02:43:41,164
"of the Briarwoods. They slink through those mists,
use them as cover. If you see it, run."

2108
02:43:41,164 --> 02:43:44,908
SAM: Thank you.

2109
02:43:44,908 --> 02:43:49,153
LAURA: We heard about green fog here. Is that
something?

2110
02:43:49,153 --> 02:43:57,037
MATT: "In the castle, yes. There are vents in what
was once the garden. I know not the nature of

2111
02:43:57,037 --> 02:44:07,502
"these vents or what is being utilized to produce
this foul, noxious odor, but it has put a scent on

2112
02:44:07,502 --> 02:44:10,052
"the city for many years."

2113
02:44:10,052 --> 02:44:13,826
LAURA: Do we know what killed the tree?

2114
02:44:13,826 --> 02:44:16,081
MATT: "We know not."

2115
02:44:16,081 --> 02:44:22,765
TRAVIS: And in your time, do you know anything
about Lady Delilah? What she is?

2116
02:44:22,765 --> 02:44:30,223
MATT: "The few times she's walked the city, it's
been procession and power. She seems to enjoy the

2117
02:44:30,223 --> 02:44:33,011
"attention. She's a vain one, that one."

2118
02:44:33,011 --> 02:44:34,348
MARISHA: Who's this?

2119
02:44:34,348 --> 02:44:36,029
LAURA and TRAVIS: Lady Delilah.

2120
02:44:36,029 --> 02:44:38,641
LAURA: Does she come out during the day?

2121
02:44:38,641 --> 02:44:42,563
MATT: "She hasn't in almost a year, but she has
before, yes.

2122
02:44:42,563 --> 02:44:46,351
"She walks in the sun, unlike her husband."

2123
02:44:46,351 --> 02:44:48,243
SAM: Unlike her husband?

2124
02:44:48,243 --> 02:44:49,664
MATT: "Yes."

2125
02:44:49,664 --> 02:44:51,019
LAURA: I don't think she's a vampire.

2126
02:44:51,019 --> 02:44:53,025
MARISHA: She may not be a vampire.

2127
02:44:53,025 --> 02:44:54,599
TRAVIS: I think she's a bitch.

2128
02:44:54,599 --> 02:44:56,815
TALIESIN: What do you think of a distraction?

2129
02:44:56,815 --> 02:44:58,343
LAURA: What kind of distraction?

2130
02:44:58,343 --> 02:45:05,314
TALIESIN: What if there was a way to start a
ruckus at the Vedmeyer estate? Start a fire,

2131
02:45:05,314 --> 02:45:08,113
maybe. Start a ruckus of some kind.

2132
02:45:08,113 --> 02:45:09,684
SAM: The Vedmeyer estate?

2133
02:45:09,684 --> 02:45:11,133
TALIESIN: The third house.

2134
02:45:11,133 --> 02:45:13,695
SAM: The duke's. Okay, yes?

2135
02:45:13,695 --> 02:45:18,189
TALIESIN: They're going to be waiting and
expecting us, so if they think we're attacking one

2136
02:45:18,189 --> 02:45:22,819
of the houses and then instead we attack the other
while everyone's rushing to deal with what they

2137
02:45:22,819 --> 02:45:27,653
think is the next attack, we attack the second
home, and then when they prepare for us to attack

2138
02:45:27,653 --> 02:45:29,917
the third home, that's when we attack the castle.

2139
02:45:29,917 --> 02:45:31,215
LAURA: I like it.

2140
02:45:31,215 --> 02:45:32,551
SAM: All right.

2141
02:45:32,551 --> 02:45:36,155
MARISHA: Wait, you want to go bam-bam-bam?

2142
02:45:36,155 --> 02:45:40,446
TALIESIN: Today, it's just one. We've already
dropped one.

2143
02:45:40,446 --> 02:45:42,355
LAURA: The next attack will be on the Briarwoods.

2144
02:45:42,355 --> 02:45:45,004
SAM: Well, he's saying create a distraction.

2145
02:45:45,004 --> 02:45:47,887
LIAM: We make a big stink in the house we're not
going into.

2146
02:45:47,887 --> 02:45:57,929
MARISHA: That I'm cool with. Percy, how much do
you want people to see the de Rolo family crest?

2147
02:45:57,929 --> 02:46:03,334
How much do you want people to know of your
presence here? Do you want a big proclamation?

2148
02:46:03,334 --> 02:46:06,541
Because I might have that.

2149
02:46:06,541 --> 02:46:09,771
TALIESIN: Will it put my sister in danger?

2150
02:46:09,771 --> 02:46:12,854
MATT: "It's hard to say."

2151
02:46:12,854 --> 02:46:18,913
TALIESIN: They don't know that I know she's alive.
Perhaps keep her, just to surprise me.

2152
02:46:18,913 --> 02:46:22,217
SAM: That symbol is not the de Rolo family seal,
is it? It's modified.

2153
02:46:22,217 --> 02:46:32,500
TALIESIN: It's a part of it. Definitely. I want
them to know. They need to know.

2154
02:46:32,500 --> 02:46:36,311
MATT: "It's a tough decision. The symbol does
carry the weight of the people and does carry a

2155
02:46:36,311 --> 02:46:42,334
"beacon of hope. But it, as you said, may put your
sister in danger. It's hard to say. The choice is

2156
02:46:42,334 --> 02:46:45,538
"yours in how you wish to use it."

2157
02:46:45,538 --> 02:46:46,981
TALIESIN: Yes.

2158
02:46:46,981 --> 02:46:56,000
MARISHA: Yes. Because I learned a trick back in
the day from my father and the Air Ashari people.

2159
02:46:56,000 --> 02:47:03,420
We used to do it as kids for fun, but it might be
perfect in this circumstance.

2160
02:47:03,420 --> 02:47:06,339
SAM: I did it a little in college. It's fun.

2161
02:47:06,339 --> 02:47:16,150
MARISHA: Dual-wielding. I can Skywrite for you.

2162
02:47:16,150 --> 02:47:19,628
LIAM: How do you mean?

2163
02:47:19,628 --> 02:47:23,440
LAURA: Like a giant sparkler.

2164
02:47:23,440 --> 02:47:25,655
LIAM: Like a what?

2165
02:47:25,655 --> 02:47:29,024
MARISHA: In the future, they came up with these
awesome things called--

2166
02:47:29,024 --> 02:47:31,138
SAM, MATT, and TRAVIS: Nope!

2167
02:47:31,138 --> 02:47:33,466
TRAVIS: Skywrite with clouds?

2168
02:47:33,466 --> 02:47:35,421
MARISHA: Yeah, skywriting with clouds.

2169
02:47:35,421 --> 02:47:39,353
LIAM: You control the clouds?

2170
02:47:39,353 --> 02:47:43,159
TRAVIS: Can you actually write letters in them?

2171
02:47:43,159 --> 02:47:44,373
MARISHA: Yeah.

2172
02:47:44,373 --> 02:47:45,754
SAM: That's crazy talk.

2173
02:47:45,754 --> 02:47:53,430
LAURA: Can you clear out clouds? Then if you can
do that, can you make these gray clouds go away?

2174
02:47:53,430 --> 02:47:55,374
MARISHA: Do we want the gray clouds to go away?

2175
02:47:55,374 --> 02:47:58,752
LAURA: Well, sunlight would be nice as opposed to
this misty fog.

2176
02:47:58,752 --> 02:48:00,069
TRAVIS: That's a good point.

2177
02:48:00,069 --> 02:48:02,554
MARISHA: Maybe temporarily.

2178
02:48:02,554 --> 02:48:08,381
MATT: Yeah, controlling weather on that scope is a
little beyond your grasp. You can alter elements

2179
02:48:08,381 --> 02:48:13,629
of it and you could darken elements of the cloud
to form a message or a symbol if you would like,

2180
02:48:13,629 --> 02:48:16,359
but actually removing the clouds, that would be--

2181
02:48:16,359 --> 02:48:18,400
LAURA: Can you poke a hole in them?

2182
02:48:18,400 --> 02:48:20,414
MARISHA: Temporarily, yeah.

2183
02:48:20,414 --> 02:48:24,272
TRAVIS: We'll remember that. Let's go pick a fight
with a house!

2184
02:48:24,272 --> 02:48:31,860
TALIESIN: From a distance. We pick a fight with a
house from a distance so we can get to the other

2185
02:48:31,860 --> 02:48:33,361
house and pick a fight there.

2186
02:48:33,361 --> 02:48:38,550
LAURA: Is there just one of us who can make a big
stink in the decoy house?

2187
02:48:38,550 --> 02:48:40,366
SAM: I can probably make a big stink.

2188
02:48:40,366 --> 02:48:42,435
LAURA: You could definitely make a big stink.

2189
02:48:42,435 --> 02:48:44,569
LIAM: But you can catch up through one of those
little doorways.

2190
02:48:44,569 --> 02:48:46,733
SAM: Please, it's big for me.

2191
02:48:46,733 --> 02:48:50,752
LAURA: How about this? I use one of my exploding
arrows you gave me.

2192
02:48:50,752 --> 02:48:52,967
SAM: Oh, those are so cool. Save those for a
person.

2193
02:48:52,967 --> 02:48:55,822
TRAVIS: It's a good ranged stink.

2194
02:48:55,822 --> 02:49:03,675
SAM: I've got Magic Missiles. I've got all sorts
of shit. I can do Stinking Clouds, I can make them

2195
02:49:03,675 --> 02:49:09,458
see things, I can blow open their doors. I can do
it. You guys go have fun.

2196
02:49:09,458 --> 02:49:15,041
TALIESIN: But you can also do this from a distance
so we can get you far away. You could do both.

2197
02:49:15,041 --> 02:49:17,528
SAM: I'll start on the distraction.

2198
02:49:17,528 --> 02:49:20,425
TALIESIN: And I'm going to give you a second arrow
as well.

2199
02:49:20,425 --> 02:49:22,025
LAURA: Of what?

2200
02:49:22,025 --> 02:49:25,397
TALIESIN: The arrow?

2201
02:49:25,397 --> 02:49:26,759
MATT: Okay.

2202
02:49:26,759 --> 02:49:30,781
LIAM: It's a question-mark arrow.

2203
02:49:30,781 --> 02:49:32,438
TALIESIN: It's an arrow?

2204
02:49:32,438 --> 02:49:38,386
MATT: Yeah. Write down arrow with a question mark.
It looks heavily tinkered. It's a little

2205
02:49:38,386 --> 02:49:41,078
front-loaded with the weight.

2206
02:49:41,078 --> 02:49:43,451
TALIESIN: You know what it will do to the roof if
it works?

2207
02:49:43,451 --> 02:49:44,315
MATT: Yeah.

2208
02:49:44,315 --> 02:49:45,572
TALIESIN: Okay, cool.

2209
02:49:45,572 --> 02:49:47,110
SAM: It's a kill-Trinket arrow.

2210
02:49:47,110 --> 02:49:52,743
LAURA: Oh man, you know what? I forgot I-- okay,
cool.

2211
02:49:52,743 --> 02:49:55,526
MATT: (laughs) Yes. What?

2212
02:49:55,526 --> 02:49:59,255
LAURA: Just don't. I have thoughts.

2213
02:49:59,255 --> 02:50:01,385
MATT: Cool, have thoughts. Keep them going.

2214
02:50:01,385 --> 02:50:02,585
LAURA: Arrow?

2215
02:50:02,585 --> 02:50:03,704
MATT: Arrow?

2216
02:50:03,704 --> 02:50:05,976
TRAVIS: All right, can we do something now,
please?

2217
02:50:05,976 --> 02:50:07,670
MARISHA: All right. Let's do it.

2218
02:50:07,670 --> 02:50:12,725
SAM: I'll head over to the other house. Show me on
the map where it is so I know where I'm going.

2219
02:50:12,725 --> 02:50:14,192
TRAVIS: What time is it?

2220
02:50:14,192 --> 02:50:18,363
MATT: By this point in the day, it's probably
around three in the afternoon.

2221
02:50:18,363 --> 02:50:20,064
TALIESIN: We're going to do this now.

2222
02:50:20,064 --> 02:50:25,063
MARISHA: When do you want the symbol to go up?

2223
02:50:25,063 --> 02:50:30,944
TALIESIN: Actually, we may not need it yet. That
may actually work out well once we've--

2224
02:50:30,944 --> 02:50:32,920
MARISHA: Lit the houses up?

2225
02:50:32,920 --> 02:50:37,168
TALIESIN: Once it's up, can you actually write it
in smoke coming off the house?

2226
02:50:37,294 --> 02:50:38,715
MARISHA: Yeah, I think I could.

2227
02:50:38,715 --> 02:50:41,950
MATT: With a crack of thunder, rainfall begins to
hit on the city.

2228
02:50:41,950 --> 02:50:44,285
TALIESIN: Really?

2229
02:50:44,285 --> 02:50:46,405
LAURA: Of course.

2230
02:50:46,405 --> 02:50:48,619
MARISHA: Why is it raining again?

2231
02:50:48,619 --> 02:50:56,060
LAURA: Because it's this fucking town. It's
fucked. No offense. It won't be fucked soon.

2232
02:50:56,060 --> 02:50:57,611
SAM: Your town sucks, weather-wise.

2233
02:50:57,611 --> 02:51:04,868
TALIESIN: So the northern house or the western
house?

2234
02:51:04,868 --> 02:51:11,072
MATT: "The northern house is the one that Count
Tylieri currently resides in. Or no. My apologies.

2235
02:51:11,072 --> 02:51:16,328
"The northern house is the one that Duke Goran
Vedmeyer currently exists in.

2236
02:51:16,328 --> 02:51:18,065
"The other is Count Tylieri."

2237
02:51:18,065 --> 02:51:19,642
TALIESIN: So this is the mess and this is our
actual?

2238
02:51:19,642 --> 02:51:23,114
SAM: I'm the mess?

2239
02:51:23,114 --> 02:51:24,736
TALIESIN: You're the mess.

2240
02:51:24,736 --> 02:51:30,975
SAM: All right. So you'll earphone me when you're
in position? Let's go, quickly.

2241
02:51:30,975 --> 02:51:32,725
We're burning daylight.

2242
02:51:32,725 --> 02:51:34,852
TALIESIN: So probably from about here.

2243
02:51:34,852 --> 02:51:36,033
MARISHA: I'm going with Scanlan.

2244
02:51:36,033 --> 02:51:38,385
LAURA: No, come with us, Keyleth!

2245
02:51:38,385 --> 02:51:41,959
SAM: If I've said it once, I've said it a hundred
times. I don't need help.

2246
02:51:41,959 --> 02:51:47,526
MARISHA: I wasn't trying to help you. I was trying
to write the de Rolo symbol in smoke. I don't

2247
02:51:47,526 --> 02:51:48,922
really care about you.

2248
02:51:48,922 --> 02:51:51,526
TALIESIN: You can do it from the other house. It's
sight-based.

2249
02:51:51,526 --> 02:51:53,491
SAM: They need your magic.

2250
02:51:53,491 --> 02:51:58,476
LIAM: It's no knocks against you. He's going to
catch up quickly.

2251
02:51:58,476 --> 02:52:00,789
SAM: And if I die, tell Pike I love her.

2252
02:52:00,789 --> 02:52:03,181
LAURA: You won't die, Scanlan.

2253
02:52:03,181 --> 02:52:07,117
SAM: I might. I'm a little wee man.

2254
02:52:07,117 --> 02:52:08,562
MARISHA: All right, I'm going with them.

2255
02:52:08,562 --> 02:52:14,396
TALIESIN: You're a little boy. We're making very
reasonable plans with this.

2256
02:52:14,396 --> 02:52:16,077
MATT: All right. Did you put your hat back on?

2257
02:52:16,077 --> 02:52:17,858
TALIESIN: I have put my hat back on, yes.

2258
02:52:17,858 --> 02:52:21,383
MATT: Okay, yes, because you're very much visibly
Percy.

2259
02:52:21,383 --> 02:52:22,715
TALIESIN: Not anymore, I'm not!

2260
02:52:22,715 --> 02:52:30,404
MATT: All right. So you groups divide, Scanlan
heading towards the northeastern house, the rest

2261
02:52:30,404 --> 02:52:36,220
of you heading towards the northwestern house.
Eventually, you get to the outskirts of both

2262
02:52:36,220 --> 02:52:40,613
abodes, and you can see the dark clouds in the
sky, occasional claps of thunder and flashes of

2263
02:52:40,613 --> 02:52:46,955
light. Even though it's midday, it's pretty dark
right now. The few folks that are out and about

2264
02:52:46,955 --> 02:52:51,572
have their heads covered with hoods, and they're
trying to stay under overhangs to stay nice and as

2265
02:52:51,572 --> 02:52:57,837
dry as they can. You are all soaked to the bone at
this point, just pushing through. Your cough is

2266
02:52:57,837 --> 02:53:03,213
still setting in pretty heavily at this point,
too. You guys make your way to the outskirts of

2267
02:53:03,213 --> 02:53:08,322
the home. You, Scanlan, skipping along, the boy
that you are with your one weird wandering eye,

2268
02:53:08,322 --> 02:53:14,504
find your way to the other abode. So. What's the
plan?

2269
02:53:14,504 --> 02:53:17,192
SAM: How far is the gate from the front door?

2270
02:53:17,192 --> 02:53:25,179
MATT: It's about 25, 30 feet. And the house that
you're looking at right now, it's very

2271
02:53:25,179 --> 02:53:33,211
well-crafted. Looks like it's made from a lot of
the fine timber of Whitestone, the lighter woods

2272
02:53:33,211 --> 02:53:38,459
and dark woods contrast with each other, stained
to show the variation in the two. It's a very

2273
02:53:38,459 --> 02:53:39,701
beautiful home.

2274
02:53:39,701 --> 02:53:43,016
SAM: Okay. Any guards? Anything around?

2275
02:53:43,016 --> 02:53:48,688
MATT: Currently, you can see there is one guard
visible at the front. That's all you can see at

2276
02:53:48,688 --> 02:53:49,775
the moment.

2277
02:53:49,775 --> 02:53:53,215
SAM: And if I walk around back, is there any guards
around back?

2278
02:53:53,215 --> 02:53:57,055
MATT: There is a second guard around back that is
just now stepping out of an outhouse that is

2279
02:53:57,055 --> 02:53:58,940
situated behind the building.

2280
02:53:58,940 --> 02:54:01,198
TALIESIN: That would excite you. I don't know
why.

2281
02:54:01,240 --> 02:54:11,138
SAM: Sure. Because they haven't phoned me to tell
me that we're ready to go, I will become a

2282
02:54:11,138 --> 02:54:13,918
dragonfly and buzz into the dwelling.

2283
02:54:13,918 --> 02:54:15,377
MATT: Okay.

2284
02:54:15,377 --> 02:54:21,126
LIAM: Meanwhile, the twins are looking at our
home, sizing it up.

2285
02:54:21,126 --> 02:54:27,819
MATT: All right. Keeping a close eye. Through the
dark rainy atmosphere, you can see on both homes,

2286
02:54:27,819 --> 02:54:36,093
the interiors are slightly lit. There appears to
be individuals at home in both homes. You just

2287
02:54:36,093 --> 02:54:42,514
can't see who it is, necessarily. There is light
in the interior. As you turn into a fly and make

2288
02:54:42,514 --> 02:54:49,760
your way, this little boy just walks and (zip). Go
ahead and make a stealth check.

2289
02:54:49,760 --> 02:54:53,114
SAM: Ten.

2290
02:54:53,114 --> 02:55:01,272
MATT: Okay. You turn into a fly and make your way
through the bars and begin (buzzing) over the yard

2291
02:55:01,272 --> 02:55:12,762
with your one-twentieth of a hit point in fly
form. Make your way. Any of the nearby windows all

2292
02:55:12,762 --> 02:55:20,932
seem to be shut. The front door is closed. There
might be a gap, but the guard is standing in front

2293
02:55:20,932 --> 02:55:22,175
of the door.

2294
02:55:22,175 --> 02:55:32,176
SAM: Okay. Again, they haven't phoned me, so I'll
perch on the handrail or door frame or something

2295
02:55:32,176 --> 02:55:34,313
just above him and wait.

2296
02:55:34,313 --> 02:55:41,756
MATT: Okay. He takes notice of your buzzing as you
go by and goes back to his watching. The rest of

2297
02:55:41,756 --> 02:55:43,077
you guys?

2298
02:55:43,077 --> 02:55:45,120
LIAM: We're sizing up the other home.

2299
02:55:45,120 --> 02:55:53,389
LAURA: Yeah. Oh, how about this? Maybe we can tell
Scanlan to set off the thingy. I'll come running

2300
02:55:53,389 --> 02:56:00,331
out as my old crazy lady, saying, (screams) the
house is under attack! Toward the guards guarding

2301
02:56:00,331 --> 02:56:05,048
this house. And then I'll just stand there as they
react.

2302
02:56:05,048 --> 02:56:07,743
LIAM: I like it. Could we look at this house
first?

2303
02:56:07,743 --> 02:56:09,035
LAURA: I thought we did.

2304
02:56:09,035 --> 02:56:11,139
TALIESIN: I thought you went to shoot the arrows
in the other house.

2305
02:56:11,139 --> 02:56:12,888
MARISHA: No, that's what Scanlan said.

2306
02:56:12,888 --> 02:56:14,674
LIAM: What do I see? I'm looking all over this
house.

2307
02:56:14,674 --> 02:56:20,496
MATT: Right. This house is also well-built,
sturdy. Mostly wood construction, but it's all

2308
02:56:20,496 --> 02:56:25,029
dark wood. It almost seems to disappear against
the gray skies above it if you're looking from a

2309
02:56:25,029 --> 02:56:30,344
downward perspective. It's a very dreary-looking
home, built to look pretty for someone who doesn't

2310
02:56:30,344 --> 02:56:37,256
like a lot of color. It's two stories; there are a
number of windows on both stories. Looks like

2311
02:56:37,256 --> 02:56:48,882
there is a small garden out front that has been
long-ignored and died and dried up. Just browns.

2312
02:56:48,882 --> 02:56:55,507
Abysmal-looking. Other than that, there's not much
else to say on the building.

2313
02:56:55,507 --> 02:56:57,215
LIAM: No guards, nobody watching?

2314
02:56:57,215 --> 02:56:59,322
MATT: Not currently any guards outside of it, no.

2315
02:56:59,322 --> 02:57:00,855
LIAM: I want to go for a circle around.

2316
02:57:00,855 --> 02:57:03,758
LAURA: Stealthy. Stealth. I cast Pass Without a
Trace on him.

2317
02:57:03,758 --> 02:57:05,415
MATT: (laughs) And you stay within 30 feet of
him?

2318
02:57:05,415 --> 02:57:06,452
LAURA: Huh?

2319
02:57:06,452 --> 02:57:07,733
MATT: Can you stay within 30 feet of him?

2320
02:57:07,733 --> 02:57:08,902
LAURA: I guess I stealth behind him.

2321
02:57:08,902 --> 02:57:10,387
MATT: All right. Both of you guys roll stealth.

2322
02:57:10,387 --> 02:57:15,434
LAURA: Oh no. Which one should I use?

2323
02:57:15,434 --> 02:57:18,849
LIAM: 28.

2324
02:57:18,849 --> 02:57:20,359
LAURA: Add ten.

2325
02:57:20,359 --> 02:57:21,949
LIAM: Good.

2326
02:57:21,949 --> 02:57:24,730
LAURA: 36.

2327
02:57:24,730 --> 02:57:25,914
SAM: Jeez!

2328
02:57:25,914 --> 02:57:29,768
LIAM: That's pretty good. What did you add? Oh,
because of Pass Without a Trace! Oh, 38.

2329
02:57:29,768 --> 02:57:32,620
MATT: There you go, 36 and 38, boom.

2330
02:57:32,620 --> 02:57:35,709
SAM: You're both discovered and killed.

2331
02:57:35,709 --> 02:57:41,694
MATT: (laughs) Immediately. Just like that. You
push into one of the nearby alleyways, curve

2332
02:57:41,694 --> 02:57:47,319
around the side, and make your way to the back
portion of this. And the gate is buttressed up

2333
02:57:47,319 --> 02:57:51,602
against one of the surrounding buildings-- it's a
warehouse of some kind-- to the point where

2334
02:57:51,602 --> 02:57:56,053
there's a little bit of space you can get over,
but it's about eight feet up and it is a spiky

2335
02:57:56,053 --> 02:58:01,156
top, but looking over, you do see there is one
guard that is slowly patrolling around the

2336
02:58:01,156 --> 02:58:05,484
outside, and you see through the nearby window
what looks like two humanoids that just crossed

2337
02:58:05,484 --> 02:58:07,037
paths at the front of the window.

2338
02:58:07,037 --> 02:58:11,083
LIAM: Two humanoids are in the house, there's a
guard between the home, and the warehouse thing

2339
02:58:11,083 --> 02:58:12,152
you just described?

2340
02:58:12,152 --> 02:58:14,920
MATT: Correct. Basically, you didn't see it from
your perspective. Once you went around the

2341
02:58:14,920 --> 02:58:18,822
alleyway to the other side of it, you do see there
is one guard that is slowly patrolling the

2342
02:58:18,822 --> 02:58:19,777
outside.

2343
02:58:19,777 --> 02:58:24,384
LAURA: (whispers) I can perch and take him out
with an arrow.

2344
02:58:24,384 --> 02:58:27,884
LIAM: You do your thing, yeah. Yeah.

2345
02:58:27,884 --> 02:58:31,907
LAURA: Do you want to sneak-attack him? That might
be smarter.

2346
02:58:31,907 --> 02:58:33,585
LIAM: I'll start, you follow.

2347
02:58:33,585 --> 02:58:34,515
LAURA: Got it.

2348
02:58:34,515 --> 02:58:35,605
LIAM: All right.

2349
02:58:35,605 --> 02:58:45,549
LAURA: Should we let Scanlan do his thing first
and then we sneak attack him? Set it all in

2350
02:58:45,549 --> 02:58:46,572
motion?

2351
02:58:46,572 --> 02:58:47,874
LIAM: Yes.

2352
02:58:47,874 --> 02:58:51,741
TALIESIN: All at the same time, then. On the count
of three.

2353
02:58:51,741 --> 02:58:53,719
MARISHA: What are we doing? Wait, what?

2354
02:58:53,719 --> 02:58:57,724
SAM: What? All I heard is on the count of three.
What's going on?

2355
02:58:57,724 --> 02:59:01,663
LIAM: Scanlan, whatever you're going to do, I want
you to get ready to do it.

2356
02:59:01,663 --> 02:59:05,232
LAURA: And then we'll count to three and we'll
attack.

2357
02:59:05,232 --> 02:59:06,920
SAM: Shouldn't I do mine first?

2358
02:59:06,920 --> 02:59:09,751
LAURA: Yeah, you do. Tell us when.

2359
02:59:09,751 --> 02:59:11,691
SAM: Oh, you want me to do mine first?

2360
02:59:11,691 --> 02:59:13,202
TRAVIS: Whenever you're ready.

2361
02:59:13,202 --> 02:59:14,942
SAM: How about wait 30 seconds and go?

2362
02:59:14,942 --> 02:59:15,811
LAURA: Got it.

2363
02:59:15,811 --> 02:59:20,097
SAM: All right. I turn into a triceratops.

2364
02:59:20,097 --> 02:59:25,662
(laughter)

2365
02:59:25,662 --> 02:59:26,883
LIAM: A what?

2366
02:59:26,883 --> 02:59:29,002
MATT: I'm going to say, roll an intelligence
check.

2367
02:59:29,002 --> 02:59:31,256
LIAM: Come on, Burt.

2368
02:59:31,256 --> 02:59:33,964
SAM: Intelligence?

2369
02:59:33,964 --> 02:59:37,719
MATT: With advantage, because you're a bard. Just
add your intelligence modifier.

2370
02:59:37,719 --> 02:59:39,124
LIAM: He gave you advantage. Roll again.

2371
02:59:39,124 --> 02:59:42,718
SAM: I already get advantage for intelligence
checks. 19.

2372
02:59:42,718 --> 02:59:49,201
MATT: Okay. Through your bardic research and
hearing many tales and seeing scribblings in books

2373
02:59:49,201 --> 02:59:55,015
of presumably madmen, apparently, that there were
certain creatures that existed long before the

2374
02:59:55,015 --> 02:59:59,711
civilization had taken root. You have heard of
some of these, one of which is the mighty and

2375
02:59:59,711 --> 03:00:04,189
frightening triceratops. You hear it's just a
fable, but it's fun to pretend to be one, sure.

2376
03:00:04,189 --> 03:00:05,447
SAM: Three horns and big.

2377
03:00:05,447 --> 03:00:12,310
MATT: Yep. And out of nowhere, this tiny fly
(boosh) into a triceratops. (boom) Lands, crushing

2378
03:00:12,310 --> 03:00:19,943
the man beneath you. He's going to attempt to--
oh, rolled a 20 on his saving throw. So he's only

2379
03:00:19,943 --> 03:00:23,239
going to take half damage. Go ahead and roll 3d6
crushing damage.

2380
03:00:23,239 --> 03:00:32,073
SAM: d6? I don't even have a d6. (laughs) Wow.
17.

2381
03:00:32,073 --> 03:00:40,022
MATT: 17? Whoa, okay. He did not like that. Okay,
he is crushed and he is prone beneath you right

2382
03:00:40,022 --> 03:00:41,488
now, (groans).

2383
03:00:41,488 --> 03:00:44,381
SAM: And for my move, I bash down the door.

2384
03:00:44,381 --> 03:00:49,967
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll an attack.

2385
03:00:49,967 --> 03:00:53,492
SAM: d20? 18.

2386
03:00:53,492 --> 03:01:00,417
MATT: Okay, yeah. Go ahead and roll another 3d6.

2387
03:01:00,417 --> 03:01:06,642
SAM: Three, six, that wasn't anything. Nine.

2388
03:01:06,642 --> 03:01:12,696
MATT: Nine plus three. 12 points of damage. You
turn around, and with a loud cracking sound, the

2389
03:01:12,696 --> 03:01:19,179
whole outside of the doorway and most of the
outside of the room is thrashed and destroyed.

2390
03:01:19,179 --> 03:01:24,684
Wood chunks go flying everywhere with a large
roar. You see part of the inside of the foyer

2391
03:01:24,684 --> 03:01:30,346
collapses from that side of the building. You
basically take out a whole support and start

2392
03:01:30,346 --> 03:01:36,181
thrashing around. You hear voices begin yelling
out from in the household, and immediately

2393
03:01:36,181 --> 03:01:43,367
five guards start rushing in from different rooms
towards you. All right. Two of which are holding

2394
03:01:43,367 --> 03:01:45,969
already armed and ready crossbows. We'll get to
that in just a second.

2395
03:01:45,969 --> 03:01:46,871
SAM: Okay.

2396
03:01:46,871 --> 03:01:48,101
MATT: You guys?

2397
03:01:48,101 --> 03:01:51,444
LIAM: I'm going to run up behind the one guard and
beat him in the back of the head with the back of

2398
03:01:51,444 --> 03:01:52,560
my dagger.

2399
03:01:52,560 --> 03:01:55,806
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll an attack. He does
not see you; this is considered a surprise

2400
03:01:55,806 --> 03:01:56,779
attack.

2401
03:01:56,779 --> 03:02:03,518
LIAM: This is a surprise attack? Oh, that's good.
Ooh, that's not that good. So that's 17.

2402
03:02:03,518 --> 03:02:04,923
MATT: That hits.

2403
03:02:04,923 --> 03:02:12,825
LIAM: That hits, all right. And then the second
attack, which'll also have advantage, is 23.

2404
03:02:12,825 --> 03:02:15,008
MATT: 23 also hits, yeah.

2405
03:02:15,008 --> 03:02:34,445
LIAM: Okay, so sneak attack, yeah? So here we go.
Plus, get them. (mutters) 25 for the first attack.

2406
03:02:34,445 --> 03:02:36,971
Or no, 25 for the first attack--

2407
03:02:36,971 --> 03:02:38,547
MATT: Sneak attack?

2408
03:02:38,547 --> 03:02:40,950
LIAM: That was it.

2409
03:02:40,950 --> 03:02:45,552
MATT: Right. It's a surprise round. Don't you get
double damage for being an assassin?

2410
03:02:45,552 --> 03:02:50,190
LIAM: Yeah, so 50. All I want to do is gunk him.
Like I do.

2411
03:02:50,190 --> 03:02:55,052
MATT: And that's all you needed. He had 45 hit
points. (whack) With one hit to the back of his

2412
03:02:55,052 --> 03:02:58,732
head, he crumples onto the ground, smacking into
the wet grass around this field.

2413
03:02:58,732 --> 03:03:03,387
LIAM: And I look over my sister's shoulder and
say, Grog! You want to play?

2414
03:03:03,387 --> 03:03:05,318
Come on, you want to play?

2415
03:03:05,318 --> 03:03:07,341
TRAVIS: Grog always wants to play!

2416
03:03:07,341 --> 03:03:12,060
LIAM: Go for the door!

2417
03:03:12,060 --> 03:03:13,670
TRAVIS: Fuck it. I rage.

2418
03:03:13,670 --> 03:03:15,170
MATT: Okay.

2419
03:03:15,170 --> 03:03:16,997
LAURA: We're just going straight into the house?

2420
03:03:16,997 --> 03:03:20,335
MARISHA: What are we doing? We're watching all
this happen? We're all like, oh, there goes Grog.

2421
03:03:20,335 --> 03:03:22,004
LIAM: Yeah, because you've said nothing.

2422
03:03:22,004 --> 03:03:28,324
MATT: You guys right now watch as now Vax runs
over and tells Grog to run in and go after the

2423
03:03:28,324 --> 03:03:29,525
front door.

2424
03:03:29,525 --> 03:03:32,809
LIAM: Well, that's not what I said. I said, do you
want to play?

2425
03:03:32,809 --> 03:03:34,494
TRAVIS: No, I took off running.

2426
03:03:34,494 --> 03:03:38,614
MATT: Grog is running toward the door now. You
guys see him bolt off, burst through the gate.

2427
03:03:38,614 --> 03:03:40,783
TRAVIS: Activate the flaming warhammer.

2428
03:03:40,783 --> 03:03:42,737
TALIESIN and MARISHA: I guess we're going.

2429
03:03:42,737 --> 03:03:44,406
LIAM: Everybody's running at the door.

2430
03:03:44,406 --> 03:03:48,363
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll a strength
check just for the hell of it. There is a closed

2431
03:03:48,363 --> 03:03:54,644
gate. Athletics, this would be.

2432
03:03:54,644 --> 03:03:56,163
TRAVIS: Oh. 14.

2433
03:03:56,163 --> 03:04:01,782
MATT: 14? Okay. It's not immediate impact. It
takes you a second; you have to force your way

2434
03:04:01,782 --> 03:04:05,489
through the gate. You essentially grab the two
sides of it and pull and pull until eventually the

2435
03:04:05,489 --> 03:04:10,530
chain snaps and the bars bend and you shove off
one of the old doors. The gate (creaks, impact)

2436
03:04:10,530 --> 03:04:16,782
onto the ground before you, leaving a straight
look to the front door. You bolt for it. The rest

2437
03:04:16,782 --> 03:04:20,266
of you guys give chase afterwards. You all rush to
the front door of this homestead.

2438
03:04:20,266 --> 03:04:22,335
It is currently closed.

2439
03:04:22,335 --> 03:04:27,612
LIAM: We saw front door, we saw some sort of
warehouse, and a side window with two people

2440
03:04:27,612 --> 03:04:28,937
going, right?

2441
03:04:28,937 --> 03:04:30,325
MARISHA: Let's flank.

2442
03:04:30,325 --> 03:04:32,460
LAURA and LIAM: Let's go in the window.

2443
03:04:32,460 --> 03:04:33,945
TRAVIS: I'll meet you in the middle!

2444
03:04:33,945 --> 03:04:35,349
LAURA: Yeah, we go in the window.

2445
03:04:35,349 --> 03:04:36,963
MARISHA: You said there was a door around back?

2446
03:04:36,963 --> 03:04:38,900
MATT and LIAM: There's windows around back.

2447
03:04:38,900 --> 03:04:40,274
MARISHA: I'll go around back.

2448
03:04:40,274 --> 03:04:41,785
TALIESIN: I'll also go around back.

2449
03:04:41,785 --> 03:04:43,942
LAURA: Oh, but that's only Grog in the front
now.

2450
03:04:43,986 --> 03:04:44,848
MARISHA: He's fine.

2451
03:04:44,848 --> 03:04:45,798
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2452
03:04:45,798 --> 03:04:48,040
LAURA: I give him Trinket. Going in with you.

2453
03:04:48,040 --> 03:04:52,304
TRAVIS: You want to send him in with me? It's
going to be nasty where I'm going. It's all-day

2454
03:04:52,304 --> 03:04:53,532
buffet.

2455
03:04:53,532 --> 03:04:55,093
LAURA: He's going in the door.

2456
03:04:55,093 --> 03:04:56,466
MATT: All righty.

2457
03:04:56,466 --> 03:05:00,721
TALIESIN: Can we see any of the damage? Is there
any smoke rising from the house yet?

2458
03:05:00,721 --> 03:05:05,318
MATT: No, there's no smoke. There's no smoke.
There's nothing sending smoke at that point.

2459
03:05:05,318 --> 03:05:10,086
LIAM: I'm trying to get a better look and listen
as I run closer to the windows.

2460
03:05:10,086 --> 03:05:14,644
MATT: And we will pick up at this moment next
week.

2461
03:05:14,644 --> 03:05:16,143
(yelling)

2462
03:05:16,143 --> 03:05:17,256
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

2463
03:05:17,256 --> 03:05:18,232
SAM: But I'm a dinosaur!

2464
03:05:18,232 --> 03:05:19,200
MATT: I know.

2465
03:05:19,200 --> 03:05:20,412
MARISHA: I'm waiting for smoke.

2466
03:05:20,412 --> 03:05:24,836
MATT: I know, and we'll see how this plays out
next week, because right now if we keep where this

2467
03:05:24,836 --> 03:05:30,365
is going, this could be-- we could be here until
late, and I need to get out of this costume.

2468
03:05:30,365 --> 03:05:33,974
LIAM: Still a dinosaur. Open the door.

2469
03:05:33,974 --> 03:05:38,030
SAM: Scanlan on the floor. Everybody flee; there's
a dinosaur.

2470
03:05:38,030 --> 03:05:42,284
MATT: (laughs) Triceratops. Damn it.

2471
03:05:42,284 --> 03:05:44,601
TRAVIS: Damn it. (laughs)

2472
03:05:44,601 --> 03:05:50,690
ZAC: So I have a couple requests from the
community. One of which is that every single one

2473
03:05:50,690 --> 03:05:55,544
of you post a full-body picture of your costume
and post it to Twitter so they can get a good look

2474
03:05:55,544 --> 03:06:01,816
without being blocked by the table. I think
everyone just really wants to see his legs because

2475
03:06:01,816 --> 03:06:03,860
he's not wearing pants under that dress.

2476
03:06:03,860 --> 03:06:05,765
LAURA: But he is wearing a little petticoat.

2477
03:06:05,765 --> 03:06:10,574
ZAC: And the other request was for you to explain
how in the hell you made this, because this is

2478
03:06:10,574 --> 03:06:15,644
amazing. They want a really quick run-down of what
you did here.

2479
03:06:15,644 --> 03:06:21,145
MATT: Okay. Well, for the armor pieces, the base
is Sintra, which is one-eighth of an inch thick

2480
03:06:21,145 --> 03:06:24,191
PVC sheeting. You can buy it at sign supply
stores.

2481
03:06:24,191 --> 03:06:25,467
LIAM: (snores)

2482
03:06:25,467 --> 03:06:28,868
MATT: I know, Liam. Shut up, they asked me. So I
cut those into sheets. You heat them up with a

2483
03:06:28,868 --> 03:06:33,494
heat-gun or really hot hairdryer and you can bend
it, so that was the shape for these. I ordered

2484
03:06:33,494 --> 03:06:40,231
aluminum chainmail off eBay, straight from India,
and cannibalized it to make the sheets of

2485
03:06:40,231 --> 03:06:45,687
chainmail that I then epoxied onto the plastic.
And this is a pleather that I stitched together

2486
03:06:45,687 --> 03:06:49,921
and then adhered across it to make the trim, and
that's how I made the armor.

2487
03:06:49,921 --> 03:06:55,608
ZAC: Would you be willing to come on Mines N
Crafts and do a little more detailed show-through

2488
03:06:55,608 --> 03:07:00,304
of it? Because it's really cool, and there's
details you guys can't see. Everyone was like, let

2489
03:07:00,304 --> 03:07:04,046
him show off his swords, and I'm like, they're not
real swords.

2490
03:07:04,046 --> 03:07:05,915
MATT: Nah, you can pull them out.

2491
03:07:05,915 --> 03:07:07,291
ZAC: Yeah, you want to show them off?

2492
03:07:07,291 --> 03:07:09,784
MATT: Sure. I can't really grab them from here.

2493
03:07:09,784 --> 03:07:12,262
ZAC: That's very ineffective for battle, Matt.

2494
03:07:12,262 --> 03:07:13,426
MATT: I know.

2495
03:07:13,426 --> 03:07:18,434
LIAM: So less dexterous than the video game.

2496
03:07:18,434 --> 03:07:22,133
MARISHA: You can't put claymores on your back,
which is a big fallacy.

2497
03:07:22,133 --> 03:07:25,589
MATT: Yeah, unfortunately I don't have the lack of
clipping that an actual warrior would have in this

2498
03:07:25,589 --> 03:07:28,764
armor. Trust me, it's a sword.

2499
03:07:28,764 --> 03:07:32,765
LIAM: Here's a little secret for people who love
video games: when the heroes pull out a gun, put a

2500
03:07:32,765 --> 03:07:36,848
gun away, pull out a sword, put a sword away,
there's a guy on the performance capture set who

2501
03:07:36,848 --> 03:07:42,050
just catches it and walks away. Hands it into your
hand, so all this, they just go (pfft) and they

2502
03:07:42,050 --> 03:07:44,114
don't put it anywhere. They just let go of it.

2503
03:07:44,114 --> 03:07:48,015
ZAC: Actually, I posted that video today on
twitter that one of the Critters posted and I

2504
03:07:48,015 --> 03:07:54,376
