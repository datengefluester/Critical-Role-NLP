1
00:00:00,158 --> 00:00:03,481
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,481 --> 00:00:08,119
nerdy-ass voice actors sit and play Dungeons and
Dragons across my camera.

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,032
(all laugh)

4
00:00:11,032 --> 00:00:15,196
MATT: Welcome to tonight's adventure. Before we
get into it, we're going to go ahead and go

5
00:00:15,196 --> 00:00:21,801
through our notes for sponsorship and other such
glory for the evening. First and foremost,

6
00:00:21,801 --> 00:00:25,117
tonight, we have our fantastic returning sponsor,
Lootcrate.

7
00:00:25,117 --> 00:00:26,425
ALL: Lootcrate!

8
00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:32,300
MATT: Thank you so much, Lootcrate. We have a
glorious unboxing that is happening right now.

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,712
LAURA: Right now!

10
00:00:33,712 --> 00:00:34,734
MATT: Let's do it.

11
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:41,245
MARISHA: So wait. They've changed their boxes and
their logos. I don't know if you guys noticed.

12
00:00:41,245 --> 00:00:45,506
SAM: I think you mean upgraded. I can't open
this.

13
00:00:45,506 --> 00:00:48,926
LAURA: So wait, we're unboxing last month's box.

14
00:00:48,926 --> 00:00:50,019
TRAVIS: This is their 'build' theme.

15
00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:51,449
TALIESIN: It's the 'build' theme.

16
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,572
LIAM: That's for building a thing, isn't it?

17
00:00:53,572 --> 00:00:55,140
MARISHA: Yeah!

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,010
LIAM: Oh, that's cute.

19
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,080
MARISHA: Oh, you know what? This was a bad
decision.

20
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,820
You're correct, this was a bad point of entry.

21
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,466
TALIESIN: This was a great decision.

22
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:07,728
TRAVIS: What did you do?

23
00:01:07,728 --> 00:01:09,223
LAURA: What did you do, Marisha?

24
00:01:09,223 --> 00:01:12,661
MARISHA: I found a perforated edge.

25
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:16,367
MATT: It's like a Batman loot container? Wait,
wait, wait. Oh, slick.

26
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,161
LAURA: You can put your soup in it!

27
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:23,471
MATT: You can put your secret keys in there. Hide
it in your front yard so nobody can take it.

28
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:25,159
SAM: There's Lego stuff!

29
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,450
TALIESIN: Oh, no there's not!

30
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,866
SAM: My kid's gonna love this!

31
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:34,842
TALIESIN: Oh my god, I got the Spaceman. Which one
did you get?

32
00:01:34,842 --> 00:01:37,912
SAM: Lego Dimensions fun pack of--

33
00:01:37,912 --> 00:01:40,020
TALIESIN: It's what's-his-name. It's Liam Neeson.

34
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,279
SAM: That's Liam Neeson?

35
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:42,334
LIAM: Yeah, they're all different.

36
00:01:42,334 --> 00:01:44,376
MATT: I got Cyborg!

37
00:01:44,376 --> 00:01:47,891
MARISHA: I got Cyborg.

38
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:50,115
MATT: Yay, we have two Cyborgs for the home.

39
00:01:50,115 --> 00:01:52,645
MARISHA: Oh, yay. Who wants to trade me a Cyborg?

40
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,562
TALIESIN: I'll trade you a Cyborg for a Spaceman.

41
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:56,837
MARISHA: Aw, yeah.

42
00:01:56,837 --> 00:01:58,839
TALIESIN: Oh my god, this is actually--

43
00:01:58,839 --> 00:01:59,942
SAM: Voltron?

44
00:01:59,942 --> 00:02:01,537
TALIESIN: No, that's Power Rangers.

45
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:02,977
TRAVIS: We don't have to give these back, right?
We can keep them?

46
00:02:02,977 --> 00:02:03,816
SAM: That's not Voltron?

47
00:02:03,816 --> 00:02:05,075
TALIESIN: That's not Voltron, man.

48
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:05,905
SAM: I'm so stupid.

49
00:02:05,905 --> 00:02:06,790
TALIESIN: I know.

50
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,399
LAURA: Did anybody show off the shirt, yet?

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,086
SAM: No.

52
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:12,365
TALIESIN: Yeah, I did, but I'll show it off again.

53
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:15,754
It's a really awesome Power Rangers shirt, with
the classic Megazord.

54
00:02:15,754 --> 00:02:16,885
LAURA: That's pretty frickin' cool.

55
00:02:16,885 --> 00:02:18,460
SAM: I'm pretty sure that's Voltron, guys.

56
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,787
TRAVIS: Megazord!

57
00:02:19,787 --> 00:02:21,039
TALIESIN: Who are you gonna believe?

58
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,289
LAURA: Wait, what size do I have?

59
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:23,912
TALIESIN: Guy with the comic book show?

60
00:02:23,912 --> 00:02:26,026
LAURA: Hey, who's got a small?

61
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:27,846
TALIESIN: I may have a small. Let me find out.
This feels small.

62
00:02:27,846 --> 00:02:28,771
LIAM: What do you got?

63
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:29,927
LAURA: I got a large.

64
00:02:29,927 --> 00:02:31,348
TALIESIN: I've got a large, never mind.

65
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:35,111
MARISHA: There's also something that tells me that
I can unlock the mysteries.

66
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:37,299
TALIESIN: Oh, this is really cool, look at that.

67
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:38,528
LIAM: What Lego did you get?

68
00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:42,659
MARISHA: Secret of the keys. Lootcrate.com/keys.

69
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:49,114
SAM: Ooh, 'How to build a tabletop RPG character'!
That's very helpful.

70
00:02:49,114 --> 00:02:52,652
TALIESIN: You should definitely read that. You
should definitely, definitely read that.

71
00:02:52,652 --> 00:02:56,064
Please read that. I'm not even kidding. Read that.

72
00:02:56,064 --> 00:02:57,083
LAURA: My favorite thing is the Batman head.

73
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,083
LIAM: You, specifically.

74
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:58,829
TALIESIN: You, read it.

75
00:02:58,829 --> 00:02:59,879
SAM: I will read that.

76
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,156
TALIESIN: Like, on the break, read it.

77
00:03:01,156 --> 00:03:01,946
SAM: Okay.

78
00:03:01,946 --> 00:03:03,108
LAURA: Thanks, Lootcrate!

79
00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:05,749
MATT: Thank you so much, Lootcrate! You're
awesome, appreciate that.

80
00:03:05,749 --> 00:03:07,129
Sam, did you want to speak a little bit--

81
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:10,962
SAM: I just wanted to say the things that we're
supposed to say, which is, our sponsor Lootcrate,

82
00:03:10,962 --> 00:03:17,959
this was their last month's theme, 'build'. This
month's theme is 'primal', featuring brands like

83
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:26,075
X-Men, Overwatch, and Predator. If you go to
lootcrate.com/criticalrole and use the promo code

84
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:33,458
'criticalrole', one word, you get 10% off. I've
prepared a very, very small bit tonight, because I

85
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:40,278
knew we had the unboxing to do. I thought for our
international audience, they might like to know

86
00:03:40,278 --> 00:03:46,153
how to say Lootcrate in different languages. So I
did some really good research. Not five minutes on

87
00:03:46,153 --> 00:03:54,596
Google Translate, I'll tell you that much. In
Spanish, Lootcrate is 'las ganancias cajas'. In

88
00:03:54,596 --> 00:04:04,999
German, it's 'der Zaster Casten'! In Japanese,
it's 'senri-hin kureto'. In Latin, it's 'praedam

89
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:16,658
corbis'. In Dutch, it's 'buit krat'. In Swedish,
we're talking 'plundra spjällĺda'.

90
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:20,838
And in Klingon, (yells in Klingon).

91
00:04:20,838 --> 00:04:22,284
(all cheer)

92
00:04:22,284 --> 00:04:23,613
TALIESIN: Good pronunciation.

93
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:33,355
SAM: Oh, and in pig latin, it's 'Am-say's ick-day
is ig-bay'. All right, good.

94
00:04:33,355 --> 00:04:34,754
MATT: Fantastic.

95
00:04:34,754 --> 00:04:42,199
LIAM: Send all your complaints care of Sam
Riegel.

96
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,012
MATT: Thank you so much, Sam. And thank you,
Lootcrate, for being our awesome sponsor. If the

97
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:49,729
announcement sheet did go out today, I did not get
it, so whoever put it together,

98
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:52,709
if they could go find it real fast while 
I talk about--

99
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,176
MARISHA: You talk!

100
00:04:54,176 --> 00:04:55,510
TALIESIN: I sent the announcement sheet to you.

101
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,554
MATT: I didn't get it in my e-mail.

102
00:04:56,554 --> 00:04:57,599
MARISHA: Let me find it on my--

103
00:04:57,599 --> 00:04:58,606
MATT: It's okay.

104
00:04:58,606 --> 00:05:00,147
MARISHA: I don't know where my phone is.

105
00:05:00,147 --> 00:05:04,271
MATT: I do want to give a heads-up, right now we
have a giveaway happening from our pals over at

106
00:05:04,452 --> 00:05:09,357
Nerdist. Thanks to Qualcomm, Lion's Gate, and the
new VR experience based on the upcoming Power

107

LA to attend the Power Rangers movie premiere, as

108
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,438

I don't know what Daydream headsets are,

109
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:22,393
but I bet you I know what they do.

110
00:05:22,393 --> 00:05:23,812
TRAVIS: They're VR, they're the VR headset.

111
00:05:23,812 --> 00:05:27,002
MATT: They give you daydreams. From now through
March 10, you can go to

112
00:05:27,002 --> 00:05:32,071
nerdist.com/powerrangersgiveaway to learn more and
enter to win,

113
00:05:32,071 --> 00:05:34,559
and we kinda prefer to see Critters
win anything that happens here--

114
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:35,807
TRAVIS: Yeah we do!

115
00:05:35,807 --> 00:05:38,895
MATT: Because then we can stack the deck against
our own people.

116
00:05:38,895 --> 00:05:41,101
To show those Nerdist guys what we
mean here at Geek and Sundry.

117
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:42,278
LAURA: What's up!

118
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:46,601
MATT: That's awesome, thank you so much for the
heads-up on that.

119
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:52,825
Let's see. The other announcements...

120
00:05:52,825 --> 00:05:55,791
MARISHA: The other announcements, I'm trying to
navigate Taliesin's phone,

121
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,531
because I don't know where my phone is, 
so this is just going--

122
00:05:58,531 --> 00:06:00,395
SAM: Taliesin's on an iPhone 2 over there.

123
00:06:00,395 --> 00:06:06,155
MARISHA: This is just going great. Fuck it. We'll
do it off the cuff.

124
00:06:06,155 --> 00:06:07,598
TALIESIN: Well no, I remember some of them.

125
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:11,041
SAM: One of them was Taliesin's announcement that
he has some show on Wednesday nights.

126
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,260
MARISHA: Wednesday Club.

127
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,709
TALIESIN: I do. Wednesday at noon to two on this
very Twitch channel, is the Wednesday Club, and

128
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:21,464
this week we're gonna be talking about Image
Comics, which is now about 25 years old. This is

129
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:25,838
the thing, and we're gonna talk about how they
started and why it's important, and then all the

130
00:06:25,838 --> 00:06:29,810
cool stuff they're doing today, which is some
really cool stuff. Good books.

131
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:37,193
MARISHA: There's also a new Signal Boost, with
Stefanie Woodburn and Eric Campbell is out-- ooh,

132
00:06:37,193 --> 00:06:44,507
there it is. Merch! Merch. Dice. Are out of
stock.

133
00:06:44,507 --> 00:06:47,035
LAURA: The dice are out of stock, you guys.

134
00:06:47,035 --> 00:06:48,298
MARISHA: Dice are out of stock.

135
00:06:48,298 --> 00:06:49,908
SAM: Don't worry, we'll get like three more.

136
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:54,480
MARISHA: Gilmore shirts. The Gilmore shirts are
still up, along with socks, vinyl stickers, mugs,

137
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,793
patches, bracelets, pins, hats, nail wraps, logo
shirts, the disturbingly comfortable 'How do you

138
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:03,374
want to do this?' t-shirt and hoodie, and more,
but not really more.

139
00:07:03,374 --> 00:07:04,812
That's actually I think everything.

140
00:07:04,812 --> 00:07:06,760
(all laugh)

141
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,912
MARISHA: I just felt like I needed a finale to
that. Oh, GM Tips!

142
00:07:11,912 --> 00:07:16,103
MATT: Oh, that's right! New episode of GM Tips
went up today. This one is about how to design and

143
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:21,984
write your own one-shot. It goes through the
process of initial story design and how to prepare

144
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:27,259
encounters and NPCs and be ready for a one-shot
circumstance for a single-run arc. These tips can

145
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:33,107
also be expanded upon to do multiple sessions or a
full arc, or even a full campaign. But these are

146
00:07:33,107 --> 00:07:36,324
little bite-sized condensed tips, so I hope
they're helpful and inspiring so people can learn

147
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:41,880
a thing or two about running a one-shot or more.
So check it out. Marisha, you--

148
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,169
SAM: Taliesin just made a robot.

149
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:46,515
MATT: That's actually pretty rad.

150
00:07:46,515 --> 00:07:47,382
TALIESIN: Hello.

151
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:48,620
MATT: You had an announcement, if I recall.

152
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,548
MARISHA: Yes! I can officially announce as of
yesterday

153
00:07:51,548 --> 00:07:54,074
that I am one of the new hosts of Gamestop TV.

154
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:57,672
(all cheer)

155
00:07:57,672 --> 00:08:03,074
MARISHA: So if you walk into a Gamestop, you can
see my dumb face talking to you about games and

156
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:09,727
all that stuff, along with Chris, who's been there
since the beginning, but yeah.

157
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,816
MATT: Since the Triassic.

158
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:11,785
MARISHA: Yeah, exactly.

159
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:12,837
LIAM: We are so proud.

160
00:08:12,837 --> 00:08:15,179
MARISHA: I'm a little kooky.

161
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:18,463
LAURA: You're always a little kooky, Marisha.

162
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:19,921
MARISHA: That's true.

163
00:08:19,921 --> 00:08:20,795
LIAM: That's you.

164
00:08:20,795 --> 00:08:23,546
MATT: It's like you were the harbinger of the end
of the circle of life for Gamestop.

165
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:25,575
MARISHA: Yeah, it's like the ouroboros kinda
thing.

166
00:08:25,575 --> 00:08:28,621
MATT: You know what I'm talking about.

167
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:32,782
LAURA: Oh my god. Lego Batman head's gonna be my
dice jail tonight.

168
00:08:32,782 --> 00:08:37,111
That's an important announcement.

169
00:08:37,111 --> 00:08:43,320
MARISHA: And last but not least, as always, Talks
Machina's live on Tuesday nights at 7PM on Twitch,

170
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:50,783
with the illustrious Brian Foster. And don't
forget, 'cause I feel like not a lot of people are

171
00:08:50,783 --> 00:08:57,400
doing this really, and I see so much, don't forget
to submit your gif and fanart of the week to the

172
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:05,035
contest, and use talksmachina@gmail.com to do
that. Put it in the subject, be like, 'contest

173
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:10,922
entry', because that helps people who are poring
through your emails.

174
00:09:10,922 --> 00:09:11,955
MATT: There you go.

175
00:09:11,955 --> 00:09:13,630
SAM: 17 more announcements, guys.

176
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,609
MARISHA: That's it. That's all we have.

177
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:15,808
MATT: Good, great!

178
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:16,750
MARISHA: Done and done.

179
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,578
MATT: All righty. That being the case, let's go
ahead--

180
00:09:19,578 --> 00:09:20,381
TRAVIS: Twins!

181
00:09:20,381 --> 00:09:21,221
MATT: Twins.

182
00:09:21,221 --> 00:09:21,852
LIAM: Twins.

183
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:27,533
MATT: -- and bring it in to tonight's episode of
Critical Role.

184
00:09:27,533 --> 00:10:58,554
(opening credits)

185
00:10:58,554 --> 00:11:03,620
MATT: Welcome back. So, to get you guys up to
speed for tonight's episode, Vox Machina, our band

186
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,962
of adventurers, after defeating the Chroma
Conclave, destroying Thordak and then Raishan, the

187
00:11:07,962 --> 00:11:16,278
mastermind behind their ascension, you then
recovered a few objects of possible-- revealing

188
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:22,797
her plans, at the very least, though keeping it
tempered. You've begun closing loose ends that you

189
00:11:22,797 --> 00:11:29,694
hadn't had the time to get to at this point,
including finishing Keyleth's Aramente. You

190
00:11:29,694 --> 00:11:38,930
managed to charter a ship and crew at Emon to head
towards the west, the Ozmit Sea, where you were

191
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:43,800
boarded temporarily by what appeared to be a band
of pirates.

192
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,992
Defeating them and sinking the ship,
you continued forward, taking a prisoner.

193
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:54,356
LAURA: A friendly prisoner. We're friendly taking
a prisoner. Nicely taking a prisoner.

194
00:11:54,356 --> 00:11:57,884
TRAVIS: What history do you remember?

195
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:02,100
MATT: You then eventually found yourselves, the
ship reaching the outside of the Anamn Mountains--

196
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,163
Anamn Islands. It's been a long week.

197
00:12:04,163 --> 00:12:07,360
TRAVIS: Yeah, man.

198
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,230
MATT: Where the ship set anchor on the outside of
the reefs that encircle the center of these three

199
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:16,990
islands, where in the center of them lies a
partially submerged city of Vesrah, the last stop

200
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:23,426
on Keyleth's Aramente and the water ashari that
live there. You, upon arriving just past sunset,

201
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:29,230
watched the city come to life, and the Vesrah come
out, and upon discovering that you were allies, or

202
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:34,195
at least friendly, they took you in and gave you
the idea of what you had to do to finish this

203
00:12:34,195 --> 00:12:42,902
Aramente. Your task, to come the following day,
was to be led down into the Aerie of Torrent,

204
00:12:42,902 --> 00:12:48,828
where the elemental rift to the water elemental
plane resides, under protection, and you were to

205
00:12:48,828 --> 00:12:55,987
retrieve three lodestones, magical stones that are
occasionally farmed from the water elemental plane

206
00:12:55,987 --> 00:13:01,084
as they fade from power. These stones are
utilized, apparently, in both keeping the rift

207
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:10,612
contained and keeping the city of Vesrah aloft and
up towards the air. However, in the process of

208
00:13:10,612 --> 00:13:15,629
them researching where these lodestones came from,
it was discovered in the most recent years that

209
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:20,721
they were byproducts of one of the krakens that
lives in the water elemental plane, and--

210
00:13:21,018 --> 00:13:22,500
LAURA: Kraken, plural?

211
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:30,979
MATT: There are a number of krakens. This one,
however, was drawn back to the rift from one of

212
00:13:30,979 --> 00:13:36,018
the earlier expeditions of the Waveriders that
were attempting to find them, and now has taken up

213
00:13:36,018 --> 00:13:42,799
its lair on the outskirts of this rift, so your
task, as Vox Machina, is to enter the rift into

214
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:48,322
the water elemental plane, find and bring back
three of these lodestones, and do so without

215
00:13:48,322 --> 00:13:53,992
slaying the kraken, as it is an important part of
the ecology and continued existence of the city of

216
00:13:53,992 --> 00:14:03,446
Vesrah. So. That's where we come up. So as it is
evening, you've been fed, a largely fish- and

217
00:14:03,446 --> 00:14:10,972
marine-based meal, and you've had the opportunity
to speak with some of the locals and prepare and

218
00:14:10,972 --> 00:14:16,771
discuss amongst yourselves exactly what you wish
to do for this journey tomorrow. So.

219
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:18,827
MARISHA: So what time is it here?

220
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:23,500
MATT: I mean, it's probably-- post-food and mild
celebration of you guys making it here in the

221
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,722
first place? They don't get too many intentional
travelers. Most of the people that come here are

222
00:14:28,722 --> 00:14:35,742
either shipwrecked, saved by the Waveriders in the
middle of storms, and some of them stay and end up

223
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:42,412
joining the Vesrah. They have a number of reformed
pirates. People that almost died at sea or drowned

224
00:14:42,412 --> 00:14:46,077
but were saved by them and eventually joined them.

225
00:14:46,077 --> 00:14:50,668
But I'd say it's about... maybe close to 10PM, the
equivalent.

226
00:14:50,668 --> 00:14:51,801
MARISHA: Oh, it's late.

227
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:53,076
LAURA: I feel like we should--

228
00:14:53,076 --> 00:14:54,434
MATT: You got here just after dusk.

229
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:58,384
LAURA: We should have a Heroes' Feast before
tomorrow. I have no idea what a kraken does, or--

230
00:14:58,384 --> 00:15:03,175
MARISHA: Me neither. Actually, is Uvenda still
around?

231
00:15:03,175 --> 00:15:05,128
She's still there, are we still in front of her?

232
00:15:05,128 --> 00:15:12,446
MATT: Uvenda is around, yeah. You can find her. As
you approach her, she's finished her meal and is

233
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:20,208
half-napping in this, almost a high chair, though
it's built beautifully of what look to be

234
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:29,343
petrified bleach-white shells and coral
structures. This looks to be her seat at this open

235
00:15:29,343 --> 00:15:36,408
natural gazebo-like eating space. She's
half-resting off to the side with her staff,

236
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:41,620
leaning off a bit, and as you start approaching,
one eye flies open and rolls in your direction,

237
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:47,054
and she leans forward. "Young Keyleth. What do you
require?"

238
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:50,151
MARISHA: Sorry. I hope I'm not interrupting.

239
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:53,742
MATT: "My nap, yes, but you seem intent. What do
you wish?"

240
00:15:53,742 --> 00:15:58,530
MARISHA: I was just curious, I guess, if you had
any advice for tomorrow morning.

241
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:03,294
Is there anything I should know in particular 
about the kraken?

242
00:16:03,294 --> 00:16:13,189
MATT: "From what we know, the kraken is a very
hungry beast. It carries with it a swarm of long,

243
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:21,501
"grasping tentacles. It moves unimpeded and
destroys structures in its path. Seems

244
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:27,126
"nigh-unstoppable, which is why maintaining the
rift is so important. To unleash more of these

245
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:31,580
"entities into our plane would be disastrous, not
just for our city, but for the entirety of the

246
00:16:31,695 --> 00:16:44,504
"Ozmit. Do be aware that you will be encountering
this beast deep, deep in the fathomless depths of

247
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:51,548
"the water elemental plane, so be prepared best you
can to swim."

248
00:16:51,548 --> 00:16:57,228
MARISHA: Right. You mentioned it being hungry.
What does it hunger for?

249
00:16:57,228 --> 00:17:04,253
MATT: "Anything that crosses its path. You'll see,
the sand below the vicinity of the rift is

250
00:17:04,253 --> 00:17:10,732
"partially soot, dirt, and sand, but a lot of it is
sprinkled bone

251
00:17:10,732 --> 00:17:15,501
"of things that failed to make it through the 
rift."

252
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,427
MARISHA: And I imagine it's pretty dark down
there.

253
00:17:18,427 --> 00:17:21,817
MATT: "It's not the brightest place, no."

254
00:17:21,817 --> 00:17:26,106
LAURA: How large are these lodestones that we're
looking for?

255
00:17:26,106 --> 00:17:30,931
MATT: "We will show you these down in the Aerie
tomorrow, but they're roughly--" and she gives a

256
00:17:30,931 --> 00:17:37,565
motion about that big in her hands. "About that
large. But you can take time and research the ones

257
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:43,118
"that are dwindling within the temple. That way,
you'll know what to look for."

258
00:17:43,118 --> 00:17:50,343
LIAM: And in all your experience with these
beasts, are their attacks mainly physical?

259
00:17:50,343 --> 00:18:01,852
MATT: "Mainly. However, they have a degree of
control over the waters that surround them. Those

260
00:18:01,852 --> 00:18:08,830
"who have returned, the Waverunners who do these
passes every few years, they speak of currents

261
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:18,703
"swiftly changing, it leaving bursts of darkened
ink-like material to obstruct the space. And they

262
00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:27,676
"speak of sudden surges of energy that rock through
the nearby waters."

263
00:18:27,676 --> 00:18:32,442
LAURA: Great.

264
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:34,095
TRAVIS: So we need snorkels.

265
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:36,018
LAURA: Lots and lots of snorkels.

266
00:18:36,018 --> 00:18:37,674
LIAM: Long ones.

267
00:18:37,674 --> 00:18:42,358
MARISHA: Are there other creatures that live in
the rift?

268
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:47,447
MATT: "There are creatures, but those of flesh and
bone usually find themselves in the belly of the

269
00:18:47,447 --> 00:18:53,897
"beast, and due to the nature of its presence, and
the rift's energy, elementals do occasionally

270
00:18:53,897 --> 00:19:02,925
"wander half-crazed, directionless in that space as
well. So be careful."

271
00:19:02,925 --> 00:19:11,530
MARISHA: All right. Is there a particular creature
that you know is good at evading this kraken?

272
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:19,360
MATT: "Our Waverunners. They travel usually in
various forms of their mer-form."

273
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,531
MARISHA: All right.

274
00:19:20,531 --> 00:19:25,447
MATT: "Anything that can swim quickly, swiftly,
search fast, and retrieve and return.

275
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:29,335
"Whatever that is to you, that's your choice."

276
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,053
MARISHA: Okay.

277
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:37,185
LAURA: Keyleth, I know you have the ability to
turn us into different things.

278
00:19:37,185 --> 00:19:38,439
MARISHA: Yes.

279
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:41,427
LAURA: Is it possible to turn us into water
elementals?

280
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:42,803
MARISHA: No, that's--

281
00:19:42,803 --> 00:19:44,168
LAURA: It's not a thing.

282
00:19:44,168 --> 00:19:47,377
MARISHA: -- that's not really a beast. I can turn
you into--

283
00:19:47,377 --> 00:19:51,663
TRAVIS: Like a great herd of dolphins that we can
commandeer?

284
00:19:51,663 --> 00:19:52,576
TALIESIN: Sea cows.

285
00:19:52,576 --> 00:19:54,596
TRAVIS: Yeah. And then just ride them--

286
00:19:54,596 --> 00:19:55,848
LAURA and LIAM: Manatees.

287
00:19:55,848 --> 00:19:58,641
LAURA: Narwhals!

288
00:19:58,641 --> 00:19:59,744
TRAVIS: They do have a spike.

289
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:01,483
TALIESIN: The worst of like five worlds.

290
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:02,776
LIAM: The unicorns of the sea.

291
00:20:02,776 --> 00:20:06,162
MARISHA: Well, I know that Taryon and I can
alter ourselves into merfolk.

292
00:20:06,256 --> 00:20:08,025
SAM: Yes.

293
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:13,256
MARISHA: And you can also-- how many people can
you imbue with your powers?

294
00:20:13,256 --> 00:20:16,052
SAM: To become underwater sea-breathers?

295
00:20:16,052 --> 00:20:19,575
MARISHA: Yeah, could you give Alter Self to
others?

296
00:20:19,575 --> 00:20:26,615
SAM: I mean, technically, I could. It would use a
lot of my spell abilities, but I could give four

297
00:20:26,615 --> 00:20:29,857
of my little coins to people, and those coins
could be used

298
00:20:29,857 --> 00:20:38,764
to alter yourself to be a water-breathing 
madman like me.

299
00:20:38,764 --> 00:20:40,613
LAURA: Merfolk?

300
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:43,800
SAM: Well, sort of. Just you, but with gills.

301
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,095
LAURA: What if we want to be a mermaid, though?

302
00:20:45,095 --> 00:20:45,968
SAM: Sure, yeah, you could do that.

303
00:20:45,968 --> 00:20:47,330
LAURA: Okay, sweet.

304
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,802
MATT: With the Alter Self, you can give yourself
gills and webbed hands,

305
00:20:49,802 --> 00:20:52,996
and you would gain a swim speed of your 
normal walking speed.

306
00:20:52,996 --> 00:20:56,262
LAURA: And a seashell bra.

307
00:20:56,262 --> 00:21:01,997
MATT: Should that be your preference, sure.
As she begins to talk about the--

308
00:21:01,997 --> 00:21:03,076
TRAVIS: For all of us.

309
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:04,436
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. Oh, please.

310
00:21:04,436 --> 00:21:05,187
MARISHA: Definitely.

311
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:06,005
TALIESIN: We're all on board.

312
00:21:06,005 --> 00:21:10,204
LIAM: This all she talked about from ages six to
13. Only thing.

313
00:21:10,204 --> 00:21:11,969
MARISHA: (sings) We are the daughters of Trident!

314
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:14,280
TRAVIS: (sings) I want to go where the people
are.

315
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,123
LIAM: Look at our DM.

316
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,689
MATT: "Anyway."

317
00:21:20,689 --> 00:21:26,184
SAM: I could also think of a spell that would give
you a clever Rastafarian crab sidekick.

318
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:27,542
LAURA: Ooh, I like it. Oh, Trinket!

319
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:28,489
TALIESIN: Turn Trinket into a--

320
00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:30,148
MARISHA: Oh my gosh! Yeah! Yeah!

321
00:21:30,148 --> 00:21:33,587
TALIESIN: Okay, okay. Gotta put the foot 
down before this gets weird.

322
00:21:33,587 --> 00:21:35,032
LAURA: Okay.

323
00:21:35,032 --> 00:21:37,222
MARISHA: I agree. Let's talk about this over a
Heroes' Feast. How's that?

324
00:21:37,222 --> 00:21:38,656
LAURA: Yeah, but a midnight feast like--

325
00:21:38,656 --> 00:21:39,675
TALIESIN: We're not doing Hero's Brunch?

326
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,693
LAURA: No, 'cause that would waste a spell on the
day.

327
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:43,436
TRAVIS: Keyleth? I don't think she's done
talking.

328
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:46,433
MARISHA: Who? What?

329
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:51,298
MATT: "Just be warned..."

330
00:21:51,298 --> 00:21:53,384
MARISHA: Sorry, we get carried away.

331
00:21:53,384 --> 00:22:00,763
MATT: "I would recommend taking some time in the
water first. Learn how it reacts to you and you

332
00:22:00,763 --> 00:22:10,143
"react to it. Know that the limitations of not
combating in air can be restrictive."

333
00:22:10,143 --> 00:22:13,165
LAURA: Makes sense. I don't know how my bow's
going to work underwater.

334
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,168
TALIESIN: I don't know how my guns are going to
work underwater.

335
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,410
MARISHA: Do you have a training ground?

336
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:23,033
Like an arena that's kind of comparable 
we can test in tonight?

337
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:30,846
MATT: "Tonight? We could escort you to one of the
more deep areas in Vesrah if you'd like."

338
00:22:30,846 --> 00:22:32,901
TRAVIS: Does it have to be tonight?

339
00:22:32,901 --> 00:22:34,667
SAM: Well, yes, if we want to recover all our
abilities for tomorrow.

340
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:36,497
MARISHA: We're leaving in the morning.

341
00:22:36,497 --> 00:22:40,923
TRAVIS: Oh. Right, yeah. Good point.

342
00:22:40,923 --> 00:22:44,613
MARISHA: Do we want to practice now and eat later,
or eat now and practice later?

343
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,516
LAURA: Practice for an hour, have a midnight
feast.

344
00:22:46,516 --> 00:22:49,988
TRAVIS: I hear you're not supposed to fight or
kill anything for 30 minutes after you eat.

345
00:22:49,988 --> 00:22:50,541
LAURA: Right.

346
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:51,220
TALIESIN: At least 30 minutes.

347
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:51,939
MARISHA: Yeah.

348
00:22:51,939 --> 00:22:53,008
LAURA: So fight first, and then snack.

349
00:22:53,008 --> 00:22:55,488
MARISHA: So fight first. Yeah, we shouldn't swim
after eating.

350
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,096
TALIESIN: You'll just get a cramp.

351
00:22:56,096 --> 00:22:56,902
MARISHA: Cramps.

352
00:22:56,902 --> 00:22:58,323
LIAM: Even that's a pretty big number for you.

353
00:22:58,323 --> 00:23:05,039
TRAVIS: I just say it, I don't know what it means.
30.

354
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:10,597
MATT: All right. You guys are escorted over four
or five structures past the main eating

355
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:16,616
thoroughfare into an area that quickly descends.
The beach drops down into about a ten, 15-foot

356
00:23:16,616 --> 00:23:21,638
depth. You can see this area is almost like a
farming ground for bits of kelp and

357
00:23:21,638 --> 00:23:26,109
other sea plants that are just maintained 
for food.

358
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:29,425
MARISHA: So we're doing this in the morning,
right? We're leaving first thing?

359
00:23:29,425 --> 00:23:30,751
MATT: You guys just said you were doing it
before--

360
00:23:30,751 --> 00:23:32,564
LAURA: No, no, no, no, no, yes. We're doing that,
but we're leaving in the morning.

361
00:23:32,564 --> 00:23:34,034
MARISHA: No, we're leaving in the morning though,
at dawn.

362
00:23:34,034 --> 00:23:36,257
MATT: Yeah, tomorrow is when you actually venture
down to the Aerie.

363
00:23:36,257 --> 00:23:37,255
SAM: At dawn, we swim.

364
00:23:37,255 --> 00:23:37,870
LAURA: Yeah.

365
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,968
MARISHA: At dawn, we swim. Then I'm going to go
ahead and

366
00:23:40,062 --> 00:23:46,088
cast Water Breathing on all of us now,
because it lasts for 24 hours.

367
00:23:46,088 --> 00:23:49,187
MATT: Okay. So how many targets can you do with
that?

368
00:23:49,187 --> 00:23:50,654
LAURA: Can we still breathe on land?

369
00:23:50,654 --> 00:23:51,993
MARISHA: Up to ten, I believe.

370
00:23:51,993 --> 00:23:55,214
SAM: No. (laughs)

371
00:23:55,303 --> 00:23:57,957
MARISHA: I think it's up to ten. Let me
double-check. I'm pretty sure it's ten.

372
00:23:57,957 --> 00:23:59,450
MATT: Oh, don't worry. In older editions, there
were arguments, because they didn't specify.

373
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,659
LAURA: Yeah? Ooh.

374
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:01,347
LIAM: Oh, great.

375
00:24:01,347 --> 00:24:03,644
TALIESIN: You have to sleep with a glass of water
by the bed.

376
00:24:03,644 --> 00:24:07,240
LAURA: Sleep in a fishbowl.

377
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,989
MATT: All right, so between all of you, including
Trinket, you guys are able to imbue,

378
00:24:11,989 --> 00:24:13,494
for the next 24 hours, Water Breathing 
onto the party.

379
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:14,871
MARISHA: Ten. Willing creatures.

380
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:20,400
MATT: Ten willing creatures, perfect. Ah, Doty
does not need it. Doty does not breathe. All

381
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,130
right, so you guys, you feel this strange kind of
sensation as the air seems to change in your

382
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:30,324
lungs, but still function. It's a bit colder, and
as you slowly submerge yourself in the water, you

383
00:24:30,324 --> 00:24:34,581
dip underneath, and the instinct is to hold your
breath for as long as you can. It's that natural

384
00:24:34,581 --> 00:24:38,996
survival instinct, but the moment you give in and
allow yourself to inhale you panic for a moment

385
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:46,245
but then regulate, for a moment, and feel the
water cycle through. It's cold. It chills the

386
00:24:46,245 --> 00:24:52,858
interior of your lungs a bit, but you can breathe
fine. Speaking's still a bit of an issue. It's

387
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:57,459
still a kind of a garbled-- there's no air passing
past the vocal cords.

388
00:24:57,459 --> 00:25:02,749
TRAVIS: (garbled) I'm peeing. I'm peeing in 
the water right now.

389
00:25:02,749 --> 00:25:06,916
LIAM: (garbled) Three hours of this.

390
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:09,808
LAURA: Can we see under the water? How's our
perc--

391
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:10,551
TRAVIS: Visibility.

392
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:11,614
LAURA: Visibility?

393
00:25:11,614 --> 00:25:18,884
MATT: Your visibility is as good as it would be
underwater. It's murky. It's difficult to get a

394
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:26,034
very clear view of anything beyond maybe a 20-foot
span. Plus, this is nighttime. It's dark.

395
00:25:26,034 --> 00:25:27,990
LAURA: What about Percy with his glasses?

396
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:31,366
I mean, could we do some sort of goggle things, 
so we can see better?

397
00:25:31,366 --> 00:25:33,038
TALIESIN: We could try to craft some goggles.

398
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:34,393
LIAM: You put 'em away. Didn't you?

399
00:25:34,393 --> 00:25:35,723
LAURA: So that we could see underwater.

400
00:25:35,723 --> 00:25:36,813
LIAM: Aren't they for close up?

401
00:25:36,813 --> 00:25:40,818
TALIESIN: Yeah, they are for close up, but they're
not attached to my-- water could get in.

402
00:25:40,818 --> 00:25:41,858
LAURA: Oh.

403
00:25:41,858 --> 00:25:42,981
TRAVIS: Do you want me to hold your glasses again
for you?

404
00:25:42,981 --> 00:25:44,393
MATT: You would have to ask, probably, for
materials to do that.

405
00:25:44,393 --> 00:25:45,044
TALIESIN: Yes.

406
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,759
MATT: You don't have anything to craft goggles.

407
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:48,675
LIAM: You don't want to lose them in the ocean.
Maybe put them away?

408
00:25:48,675 --> 00:25:50,193
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll put them in, I've got a
pocket.

409
00:25:50,193 --> 00:25:54,086
LIAM: Just, just don't open it.

410
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:59,620
SAM: Crafting goggles. Would it be helpful to
craft something that would allow us to speak? Or--

411
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:05,032
LAURA: I don't know if there's time for all of
that. It'd be great, though.

412
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:07,473
Tary, you're really good at crafting, right?

413
00:26:07,473 --> 00:26:13,090
SAM: I am, I would say the best at crafting,
actually. I've spent my whole life doing it.

414
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:16,186
LAURA: All right, could you make something like
that in like an hour?

415
00:26:16,186 --> 00:26:26,026
SAM: I have no idea. But the adventure is to try,
right? And I certainly will give it a go.

416
00:26:26,026 --> 00:26:28,582
TALIESIN: My big question is, what am I going to
do with my guns?

417
00:26:28,582 --> 00:26:29,580
TRAVIS: Go find out.

418
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,260
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to try to shoot an arrow
and see what happens.

419
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,836
MARISHA: Yeah, go find out, that's why we're here,
man.

420
00:26:32,836 --> 00:26:38,311
MATT: Okay, you pull back and release the arrow,
and it does fire, but it fires much slower and is

421
00:26:38,311 --> 00:26:42,514
impeded. It only gets about half as far, and even
then with a dull thud.

422
00:26:42,514 --> 00:26:45,515
LAURA: Does it-- It doesn't seem like it pierces
any?

423
00:26:45,515 --> 00:26:51,707
MATT: It functions, but essentially the-- and this
goes for any ranged attacks, most ranged attacks I

424
00:26:51,707 --> 00:26:55,937
should say, and melee attacks are at disadvantage
underwater.

425
00:26:55,937 --> 00:26:58,224
TRAVIS: What!

426
00:26:58,224 --> 00:27:03,584
MATT: And ranged attacks don't go further than
their first range increment.

427
00:27:03,584 --> 00:27:05,264
LAURA: So what would that be?

428
00:27:05,264 --> 00:27:06,373
TALIESIN: I'm gonna have to look up my first range
increment

429
00:27:06,373 --> 00:27:08,278
MATT: So if you look at your bow, and it says
like, you know, 60 feet, 120 feet,

430
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:09,831
you know, for first increment, second increment.

431
00:27:09,831 --> 00:27:10,382
LIAM: Yeah.

432
00:27:10,382 --> 00:27:11,098
LAURA: Uh-huh.

433
00:27:11,098 --> 00:27:14,353
MATT: It's disadvantage, and anything past that
first increment is an automatic miss.

434
00:27:14,353 --> 00:27:15,466
It just stops in the water.

435
00:27:15,466 --> 00:27:16,178
LAURA: Oh no!

436
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:17,389
LIAM: So, for example, daggers'--

437
00:27:17,389 --> 00:27:18,005
TRAVIS: Thank you, Ryan.

438
00:27:18,005 --> 00:27:18,840
LAURA: Thank you, Ryan.

439
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,967
LIAM: -- short distance is 20 feet.

440
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:20,825
MATT: Yeah.

441
00:27:20,825 --> 00:27:22,254
LIAM: I could throw it 20 feet at disadvantage.

442
00:27:22,254 --> 00:27:22,990
MATT: And that's as far as it'll go.

443
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,409
LIAM: Gameplay wise, game mechanics.

444
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,740
MATT: Also, your movement speed is halved.

445
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,099
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch!

446
00:27:28,099 --> 00:27:28,749
LIAM: This is awesome!

447
00:27:28,749 --> 00:27:29,651
TALIESIN: Unless we web.

448
00:27:29,651 --> 00:27:30,247
LAURA: So, for a longbow.

449
00:27:30,247 --> 00:27:31,652
MATT: Unless you have webbed fingers, or you know,
use Alter Self

450
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:32,888
TALIESIN: Or turn into dolphins, or--

451
00:27:32,888 --> 00:27:35,065
MARISHA: We could be great whites.

452
00:27:35,065 --> 00:27:36,265
LAURA: Ooh! Let's be sharks.

453
00:27:36,265 --> 00:27:37,196
TALIESIN: Swordfish.

454
00:27:37,196 --> 00:27:38,168
MARISHA: We could be sharks.

455
00:27:38,168 --> 00:27:39,306
LAURA: Or we could be merpeople.

456
00:27:39,306 --> 00:27:42,533
MARISHA: I can also change us whenever we feel
like being something else.

457
00:27:42,533 --> 00:27:45,624
TALIESIN: Eels. Electric eels.

458
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:51,212
MARISHA: It just takes a turn. Rock it like an
electric eel!

459
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:53,630
LAURA: How do I find out how far a longbow can
shoot?

460
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:59,461
TALIESIN: Not that I don't know this isn't going
to work, but I'm going to try and see if I can

461
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:04,999
get, even with like maybe an electric pulse, if I
can light the powder.

462
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:07,281
If the powder's wet, the powder's wet. 
Once I open that thing--

463
00:28:07,281 --> 00:28:09,042
MATT: The minute you submerge your gun, the powder
is wet.

464
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:10,630
Your firearms will not function underwater.

465
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,621
TALIESIN: They're not going to function
underwater.

466
00:28:11,621 --> 00:28:12,337
MATT: I'm sorry, Percy.

467
00:28:12,337 --> 00:28:14,961
TALIESIN: It's okay. No, I'd be worried if they
did.

468
00:28:14,961 --> 00:28:19,710
MATT: All right, so for the longbow, your first
range increment is 150 feet, so you're okay.

469
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,639
LAURA: Okay.

470
00:28:20,639 --> 00:28:22,091
MATT: But anything beyond that, not functional.

471
00:28:22,091 --> 00:28:23,254
LAURA: Done, okay.

472
00:28:23,254 --> 00:28:26,174
TRAVIS: So, all melee attacks are at disadvantage,
because you're swinging through water.

473
00:28:26,174 --> 00:28:29,124
MATT: Correct. Yeah, you're going against
resistance in the water.

474
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,834
TRAVIS: Fucking hate the ocean now.

475
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,804
TALIESIN: So there's no way to put a bubble around
me or anything, is there?

476
00:28:33,804 --> 00:28:36,349
MARISHA: Sorry.

477
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:37,521
LAURA: Yeah but, oh.

478
00:28:37,521 --> 00:28:38,443
SAM: A bubble around what?

479
00:28:38,443 --> 00:28:39,289
TRAVIS: Like an airtight bubble.

480
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:40,237
TALIESIN: Like some sort of bubble.

481
00:28:40,237 --> 00:28:40,836
SAM: Ooh.

482
00:28:40,836 --> 00:28:42,885
LIAM: So you think if your bullets were to pierce
out through this bubble,

483
00:28:42,885 --> 00:28:44,301
they could still go a ways.

484
00:28:44,301 --> 00:28:45,922
TALIESIN: Or I could even put the tip of the gun
out of the bubble.

485
00:28:45,922 --> 00:28:46,992
LAURA: Wait, you can shoot into water.

486
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:51,373
TALIESIN: And fire, but as long-- the combustion
has to happen in air.

487
00:28:51,373 --> 00:28:54,055
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, be in a closed airtight space
with a firearm,

488
00:28:54,055 --> 00:28:56,352
that will do wonders for your ears.

489
00:28:56,352 --> 00:28:57,018
SAM: The firearm.

490
00:28:57,018 --> 00:28:58,359
TALIESIN: How do you even know all this?

491
00:28:58,359 --> 00:28:59,180
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry.

492
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,808
SAM: The firearm has to be enclosed, not you.

493
00:29:00,808 --> 00:29:02,393
TALIESIN: Not me, just the firearm.

494
00:29:02,393 --> 00:29:07,465
SAM: But it would only last one shot. Blow a hole
in the side, then water would get out.

495
00:29:07,465 --> 00:29:13,062
TALIESIN: Well, if I could have it around just the
combustion point,

496
00:29:13,062 --> 00:29:15,984
and have the barrel sticking out
of the point, that might be a thing.

497
00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:17,701
SAM: That might be something we could try to make,
I suppose.

498
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:19,586
TALIESIN: Out of what?

499
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:23,694
SAM: We could take apart Trinket. That's your
bear, right?

500
00:29:23,694 --> 00:29:24,778
TALIESIN: We're not taking apart the bear.

501
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:26,848
SAM: That's your robot bear. We could take apart
that.

502
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,645
LAURA: He's a real bear, Tary, he's a real bear.

503
00:29:28,645 --> 00:29:33,534
SAM: Oh, well then, never mind.

504
00:29:33,534 --> 00:29:34,345
LAURA: Hm.

505
00:29:34,345 --> 00:29:42,498
TRAVIS: Could you make some sort of cavernous hole
out of Doty's chest?

506
00:29:42,498 --> 00:29:46,984
SAM: We don't touch Doty.

507
00:29:46,984 --> 00:29:48,372
TALIESIN: Okay, I've got a crazy idea.

508
00:29:48,372 --> 00:29:50,399
TRAVIS: I mean, I'll touch Doty, but--

509
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,281
MATT: What's your crazy idea?

510
00:29:54,372 --> 00:29:56,053
SAM: We lure the kraken onto land.

511
00:29:56,053 --> 00:29:57,391
LAURA: He's still formulating it.

512
00:29:57,391 --> 00:29:58,449
TALIESIN: I wanna, I wanna build--

513
00:29:58,449 --> 00:29:59,773
LAURA: Through a portal, into--

514
00:29:59,773 --> 00:30:10,730
TALIESIN: I wanna build a watertight vest for the
guns. Basically just a packet that keeps that

515
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:23,943
section dry. Like a protective-- like a soft bag
that is waterproof, that would use some sort of

516
00:30:23,943 --> 00:30:29,420
stomach lining of some animal or some leather to
build it. I couldn't reload the gun.

517
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,475
MATT: No, you'd probably only get one shot each.

518
00:30:31,475 --> 00:30:34,574
TALIESIN: One shot, or would it just be one shot--
yeah, 'cause it might--

519
00:30:34,574 --> 00:30:36,713
MATT: 'Cause it would pierce the containment.

520
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:39,279
TALIESIN: Well, like it would-- just around
everything but the--

521
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,300
well, the barrel would then have to be--

522
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,522
MATT: The barrel would then fill with water.

523
00:30:41,522 --> 00:30:42,507
TALIESIN: That's--

524
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,261
MARISHA: Tary?

525
00:30:43,261 --> 00:30:44,103
TALIESIN: One shot each.

526
00:30:44,103 --> 00:30:46,392
SAM: Yes, Antlers?

527
00:30:46,392 --> 00:30:55,018
MARISHA: Respect. Can I imbue one of your mystical
coins with one of my spells

528
00:30:55,018 --> 00:30:59,454
that we give to other people or is that 
kind of your thing?

529
00:30:59,454 --> 00:31:04,007
SAM: I mean, if you inspected them, you would know
that they say 'T.D.' on them.

530
00:31:04,007 --> 00:31:06,663
They're sort of personal to me. 
I've had them minted.

531
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:10,758
MARISHA: Oh, sure, yeah. I'm sorry. I'm
farsighted. So sorry.

532
00:31:10,758 --> 00:31:14,992
SAM: I don't think that would work. It's sort of a
thing that I can do and I'm pretty cool at it.

533
00:31:14,992 --> 00:31:18,497
MARISHA: I did not mean any offense.

534
00:31:18,497 --> 00:31:24,022
SAM: None taken. I respect the question and I
respect you wanting to work with someone of my

535
00:31:24,022 --> 00:31:34,256
skill set and aptitude. I saw your work back there
at the last fight and, well, the gunslinger was

536
00:31:34,256 --> 00:31:41,729
rendered useless and everyone else was fighting on
the other boat against lesser allies. Uh, enemies,

537
00:31:41,729 --> 00:31:47,974
I mean. You and I held off that beast together and
it was quite amazing to watch.

538
00:31:47,974 --> 00:31:53,299
MARISHA: I mean, you're gonna take full credit for
it later, aren't you?

539
00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:55,185
SAM: I made the kill. It was 100% mine.

540
00:31:55,185 --> 00:31:57,553
MARISHA: All right. No, that's fine. I mean-- you
know--

541
00:31:57,553 --> 00:32:02,642
SAM: But you were there and it was a good assist
and I appreciate it.

542
00:32:02,642 --> 00:32:13,273
MARISHA: (laughs weakly) Moving on. Back to
planning.

543
00:32:13,273 --> 00:32:17,234
TALIESIN: I'm going to need some way of defending
myself or I'm going to have to take an animal form.

544
00:32:17,234 --> 00:32:18,697
MARISHA: I could give you an animal form.

545
00:32:18,697 --> 00:32:19,999
TALIESIN: I may have to have an animal form.

546
00:32:19,999 --> 00:32:21,526
TRAVIS: Like what?

547
00:32:21,526 --> 00:32:22,510
MARISHA: Shark?

548
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,670
TRAVIS: Barracuda!

549
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,795
TALIESIN: It's kind of small, isn't it?

550
00:32:25,795 --> 00:32:31,564
LAURA: A little yellow fish. A little yellow fish
that's very friendly.

551
00:32:31,564 --> 00:32:36,438
TALIESIN: A very friendly yellow fish. I was
thinking maybe

552
00:32:36,438 --> 00:32:38,986
some sort of half-octopus merperson.

553
00:32:38,986 --> 00:32:41,793
TRAVIS: Does that exist?

554
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:48,267
MARISHA: I've gotta give you something kind of
real. Kind of beastly.

555
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:54,612
But it is challenge rating
four or lower, which is awesome. That's cool.

556
00:32:54,612 --> 00:32:56,147
TRAVIS: I have a question for you.

557
00:32:56,147 --> 00:32:56,650
MATT: Yes?

558
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:03,082
TRAVIS: I have two vials of underwater breathing
from a long time ago. How long do those last?

559
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:04,628
MATT: Let me check, actually.

560
00:33:04,628 --> 00:33:06,583
TRAVIS: Like an hour?

561
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:08,274
SAM: I have a question for you as well.

562
00:33:08,274 --> 00:33:09,921
MATT: All right. What is your question?

563
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:13,323
SAM: My rod of mercurial form.

564
00:33:13,323 --> 00:33:15,274
MATT: Yes?

565
00:33:15,274 --> 00:33:20,302
SAM: We know that it can turn into a crossbow?

566
00:33:20,302 --> 00:33:21,054
MATT: One hour.

567
00:33:21,054 --> 00:33:21,854
TRAVIS: One hour?

568
00:33:21,854 --> 00:33:22,496
MATT: Yes.

569
00:33:22,496 --> 00:33:25,634
SAM: How many crossbow arrows do I own? Any?

570
00:33:25,634 --> 00:33:27,141
MATT: Yeah, you would have 40.

571
00:33:27,141 --> 00:33:28,741
SAM: 40! Okay, great.

572
00:33:28,741 --> 00:33:32,337
MATT: They're just regular bolts. They're bolts,
not arrows.

573
00:33:32,337 --> 00:33:33,340
SAM: Thank you.

574
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,638
MATT: You're welcome.

575
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:43,922
TRAVIS: Do we know if the kraken is considered
Thordak-sized or, humongous?

576
00:33:44,014 --> 00:33:46,604
MATT: You have no idea, but the stories say
immense.

577
00:33:46,604 --> 00:33:47,577
TRAVIS: Immense.

578
00:33:47,577 --> 00:33:48,253
MATT: Yes.

579
00:33:48,253 --> 00:33:49,696
TALIESIN: They could take down a ship, right?

580
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:50,616
MATT: Yeah, from what you've heard.

581
00:33:50,616 --> 00:33:51,901
LIAM: Yeah, I mean, fairy tales tell about them
pulling ships

582
00:33:51,901 --> 00:33:53,628
under the water, breaking them in half.

583
00:33:53,628 --> 00:33:56,335
LAURA: I have a little poison bolt. Do you want
one?

584
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:59,704
I've just been holding onto it. If you have a 
crossbow?

585
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:04,754
SAM: Yes, I would love that. Thank you. How much
do I owe you for it?

586
00:34:04,754 --> 00:34:06,693
LAURA: 50,000 gold.

587
00:34:06,693 --> 00:34:08,329
SAM: It seems like you're just fucking with me.

588
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:12,358
(all laugh)

589
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:14,387
TALIESIN: He's catching on.

590
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:16,407
SAM: Let's call it an even five gold.

591
00:34:16,407 --> 00:34:22,306
LAURA: Hm, I'll take it. I was just gonna gift it
to you, but I'll take the gold.

592
00:34:22,306 --> 00:34:26,825
SAM: Well, I don't want there to be any sort of
implied favors or anything that I have to return

593
00:34:26,825 --> 00:34:35,104
later. If you're all right with it, I'd like to
just keep this business, thank you.

594
00:34:35,104 --> 00:34:38,236
LAURA: I do still want an Alter Self coin.

595
00:34:38,236 --> 00:34:47,589
SAM: I mean, are we doing that? I can do four of
those Alter Self coins.

596
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:52,894
TRAVIS: Would that take away the speed halving? If
we had webbed hands and feet, would that--

597
00:34:52,894 --> 00:34:54,965
MATT: Yeah, you'd then have normal speed through
the water.

598
00:34:54,965 --> 00:34:55,878
LAURA: See, that's pretty great.

599
00:34:55,878 --> 00:34:59,134
MATT: For the record, with swimming, you're
essentially flying, too, I mean,

600
00:34:59,134 --> 00:35:02,601
as far as in water. You can swim in an up 
and down direction as well.

601
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:05,839
LAURA: That's cool.

602
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,591
TALIESIN: When I'm an animal, none of my
bonuses--

603
00:35:07,591 --> 00:35:09,722
TRAVIS: Right. So, Boots of Feral Leaping, I don't
really-- unless we're on the bottom of the ocean.

604
00:35:09,722 --> 00:35:10,865
MATT: It's not gonna help you.

605
00:35:10,865 --> 00:35:11,625
TRAVIS: Right.

606
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:12,766
MARISHA: You keep your bonuses.

607
00:35:12,766 --> 00:35:14,082
TALIESIN: My bonuses stay. So, my vestige will
actually--

608
00:35:14,082 --> 00:35:17,385
MARISHA: Yeah. I think so. Yeah. Yeah,
yeah, yeah.

609
00:35:17,385 --> 00:35:18,744
TALIESIN: We'll find out, I suppose.

610
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:19,588
MATT: If what?

611
00:35:19,588 --> 00:35:21,912
TALIESIN: If the vestiges will be functional while
I'm in animal form.

612
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:23,631
MARISHA: Wait, we're still underwater, right?

613
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:26,003
(garbled underwater speech)

614
00:35:26,003 --> 00:35:27,816
LAURA: Yeah, all of this conversation has been
happening underwater.

615
00:35:27,816 --> 00:35:29,623
We're surfacing and talking and going back under.

616
00:35:29,623 --> 00:35:32,683
SAM: Yeah, we're treading water.

617
00:35:32,683 --> 00:35:35,432
MATT: The target's gear melds into the new form.
The target can't activate, wield,

618
00:35:35,432 --> 00:35:38,129
or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

619
00:35:38,129 --> 00:35:39,126
MARISHA: With Animal Shapes?

620
00:35:39,126 --> 00:35:39,972
MATT: Yes.

621
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,145
MARISHA: So, you can't benefit from your
equipment.

622
00:35:41,145 --> 00:35:41,876
MATT: Right.

623
00:35:41,876 --> 00:35:45,186
LIAM: Does that negate all my class boosting and
all that?

624
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:47,359
MATT: All that you get in the form of the
creature.

625
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,420
If you become a creature that has an
armor class of 11, you have an armor class of 11.

626
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,359
LIAM: What about these merpeople?

627
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:56,863
MATT: Alter Self, you keep all your stuff and just
gain the ability to swim underwater.

628
00:35:56,863 --> 00:36:00,027
MARISHA: And it's our movement speed, which isn't
very fast.

629
00:36:00,027 --> 00:36:02,429
MATT: Correct, but it's better than half your
movement speed.

630
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:02,955
MARISHA: Correct.

631
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:05,020
MATT: Which is really not very fast. So your
call.

632
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:08,332
MARISHA: Could killer whales give us a movement
speed of 60 swim feet?

633
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,882
TRAVIS: We're not fucking whales.

634
00:36:10,882 --> 00:36:11,781
TALIESIN: I'm turning into one.

635
00:36:11,781 --> 00:36:14,686
MARISHA: He was into sharks, but he has something
against whales.

636
00:36:14,686 --> 00:36:15,756
LIAM: I mean, don't knock it.

637
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,640
TRAVIS: (whale noises)

638
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,157
MARISHA: They're faster.

639
00:36:19,157 --> 00:36:19,946
LAURA: Are they?

640
00:36:19,946 --> 00:36:21,870
MARISHA: Yeah, they are.

641
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,629
LAURA: Yeah, but what if the kraken sees it?

642
00:36:23,629 --> 00:36:26,588
MARISHA: It says in the book that they are
definitely faster.

643
00:36:26,588 --> 00:36:28,578
TRAVIS: Maybe orcas, but they're not whales,
right?

644
00:36:28,578 --> 00:36:29,988
TALIESIN: They're not actually whales. They're
orca.

645
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:31,880
TRAVIS: They're like porpoises and shit.

646
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,257
TALIESIN: They-- yeah, like with cool tattooing.

647
00:36:34,257 --> 00:36:38,293
MARISHA: You guys were down with manatees, but
have something against killer whales?

648
00:36:38,293 --> 00:36:40,045
I feel like our priorities are off.

649
00:36:40,045 --> 00:36:43,469
TALIESIN: Look, we can have different animals.
Like, he can shark and I can whale.

650
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:47,622
LIAM: Also, I know it's always been a waste of
time, our planning, but we're not even talking

651
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:54,332
about what we're going to try to do. Are we going
to try to distract this fucker and take his lodes or--

652
00:36:54,332 --> 00:36:57,478
MARISHA: I mean, if we use Pass Without A Trace,
right?

653
00:36:57,478 --> 00:36:59,322
LAURA: Yeah?

654
00:36:59,322 --> 00:37:02,869
MARISHA: I mean, Pass Without A Trace should still
work underwater.

655
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:07,395
If we're all something super stealthy, we move 
super fast, get there, and get out.

656
00:37:07,395 --> 00:37:09,373
LAURA: Let me make sure Pass Without A Trace is
not concentration.

657
00:37:09,373 --> 00:37:12,890
TRAVIS: Important question. Do we know if the
elemental plane is more like the waters off the

658
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:16,153
Cayman Islands and it's crystal clear for hundreds
of feet or is it

659
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:20,330
like more murky, boggish Louisiana, 
Gulf of Mexico-type water?

660
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:23,887
MARISHA: It seems like it's Marianas Trench
levels. Seems like--

661
00:37:23,887 --> 00:37:26,779
MATT: Yeah, it's pretty dark. From what you've
heard and what they've talked about, the water

662
00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:32,501
elemental plane, most of it feels like you're a
mile beneath the surface of the ocean.

663
00:37:32,612 --> 00:37:34,360
LIAM: Oh, shit.

664
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,129
LAURA: We have to be animals that can grab
things.

665
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:37,484
TRAVIS: Light is also important.

666
00:37:37,484 --> 00:37:40,475
MATT: There is a little bit of light that comes
through.

667
00:37:40,475 --> 00:37:48,209
You do have some visibility, though the
source is difficult to really ascertain.

668
00:37:48,209 --> 00:37:54,068
MARISHA: Here's my thought. Certain of us are
gonna be better under the water with our natural

669
00:37:54,068 --> 00:37:59,805
forms and some of us aren't. Half of us go...
(laughs)

670
00:37:59,805 --> 00:38:01,818
SAM: Ooh, I like this. She is smart.

671
00:38:01,818 --> 00:38:06,333
MARISHA: Half of us are animals.

672
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:12,851
The other half can ride them in our Alter Self 
forms like a SeaWorld show.

673
00:38:12,851 --> 00:38:18,487
SAM: Yes, yes, absolutely. I volunteer to be a
rider or a captain of the ship sort of.

674
00:38:18,487 --> 00:38:20,842
TALIESIN: If we throw a little bit of rope
together, we can make some quick harnesses,

675
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:27,093
including harnesses that include a little bit of a
netting for the stones as we get them.

676
00:38:27,093 --> 00:38:31,618
SAM: A harness around the big man? I think that
would be quite a formidable steed.

677
00:38:31,618 --> 00:38:33,115
TRAVIS: You back the fuck up right now.

678
00:38:33,115 --> 00:38:36,105
SAM: All right. Just strategizing, chum.

679
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,137
TRAVIS: I understand that.

680
00:38:37,137 --> 00:38:40,425
MARISHA: Because I can Alter Self at will and you
have to take

681
00:38:40,425 --> 00:38:42,990
a spell slot, or can you do it at will?

682
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:46,893
SAM: I don't know what "at will" means, but I'm
very impressed.

683
00:38:46,893 --> 00:38:48,923
MARISHA: Yes.

684
00:38:48,923 --> 00:38:51,157
GROG: That's not a terrible idea, 'cause I'm gonna
be able to

685
00:38:51,157 --> 00:38:55,585
do dick diddly shit in there. That's, like, zero.

686
00:38:55,585 --> 00:39:00,802
MARISHA: It means one of us might have to borrow
your bag of holding.

687
00:39:00,802 --> 00:39:04,223
TRAVIS: No, I'm out. I'll stay on the
land.

688
00:39:04,223 --> 00:39:05,799
MARISHA: Tary, you had a bag of holding, right?

689
00:39:05,799 --> 00:39:06,804
SAM: I do.

690
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:08,161
MARISHA: All right!

691
00:39:08,161 --> 00:39:10,189
SAM: What do we need it for? Oh, to put the--

692
00:39:10,189 --> 00:39:11,651
MARISHA: The lodestones in.

693
00:39:11,787 --> 00:39:16,631
SAM: The things in that we're finding. Oh, yes,
yes, of course and they would be great keepsakes.

694
00:39:16,631 --> 00:39:18,691
MARISHA: No, you cannot keep them.

695
00:39:18,691 --> 00:39:21,604
SAM: Oh, well, if we find an extra one, perhaps I
could take that back as a--

696
00:39:21,604 --> 00:39:22,727
LIAM: Question.

697
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:23,602
SAM: Yes?

698
00:39:23,602 --> 00:39:28,932
LIAM: I'm obviously a fan of stealth, right? But
when we go in there and it all fucks up like it

699
00:39:28,932 --> 00:39:33,588
does nine times out of ten and the thing sees us
anyway, what are we doing?

700
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:34,451
LAURA: Run!

701
00:39:34,451 --> 00:39:35,088
MARISHA: Run.

702
00:39:35,088 --> 00:39:37,083
LIAM: Without the lodes? With the lodes?

703
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:40,683
TALIESIN: Well, those of us who can swim quite
quickly will try and evade.

704
00:39:40,683 --> 00:39:42,844
We'll try and hide and keep looking for them.

705
00:39:42,844 --> 00:39:43,718
LAURA: Distract him.

706
00:39:43,718 --> 00:39:45,432
LIAM: But we don't wanna hurt this thing, so what
are we doing?

707
00:39:45,432 --> 00:39:48,692
Interference and distract and a
couple of us try to smash and grab?

708
00:39:48,692 --> 00:39:49,550
TRAVIS: Yeah, diversion.

709
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,246
TALIESIN: Diversion, scatter, grab, and run.

710
00:39:51,246 --> 00:39:52,099
MARISHA: Yeah.

711
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:55,979
LAURA: Only attack if truly necessary.

712
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:56,925
SAM: New guy here--

713
00:39:56,925 --> 00:39:58,520
TRAVIS: Bait. I like it. Way to volunteer,
captain.

714
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:05,121
SAM: No, nope, nope. New guy here, just a process
question. I'm new to these sort of strategy

715
00:40:05,121 --> 00:40:09,701
"seshes" that you guys have. Is this how it always
is, with people

716
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:14,428
just throwing out random bad ideas
constantly for, like, 15 minutes?

717
00:40:14,428 --> 00:40:14,816
LIAM: Yeah.

718
00:40:14,816 --> 00:40:15,844
TALIESIN: That's about right.

719
00:40:15,844 --> 00:40:18,214
LIAM: We do that and then we kind of take it like
jazz on the day, you know?

720
00:40:18,214 --> 00:40:25,337
SAM: Wow, because I really-- this is a big fight
for me. I've never fought anything quite so big.

721
00:40:25,337 --> 00:40:29,869
Is there a chance that we might perish?

722
00:40:29,869 --> 00:40:30,465
MARISHA: Yes.

723
00:40:30,465 --> 00:40:31,394
TALIESIN: Pretty good.

724
00:40:31,394 --> 00:40:33,601
TRAVIS: No, we're fine.

725
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:37,216
SAM: Because it doesn't seem like we have a good
plan right now.

726
00:40:37,216 --> 00:40:41,153
TALIESIN: Well, that's the thing about these sorts
of encounters, is that any plan you have is pretty

727
00:40:41,153 --> 00:40:44,831
much going to be out the window the minute you see
it anyway.

728
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:45,675
SAM: All right.

729
00:40:45,675 --> 00:40:50,781
LIAM: If it makes you feel any better, this feels
less asinine than many things that we've done before.

730
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,985
SAM: That does make me feel better.

731
00:40:52,985 --> 00:40:56,332
LAURA: It's true. Half of us are animals, half of
us are riders.

732
00:40:56,332 --> 00:40:58,056
TALIESIN: Half more a plan than we normally have.

733
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:02,925
LIAM: I once teleported into the belly of a dragon
with another jackass and that went tits up fast.

734
00:41:02,925 --> 00:41:06,574
SAM: That sounds like the stupidest fucking plan
I've ever heard.

735
00:41:06,574 --> 00:41:08,344
LIAM: I'm still breathing.

736
00:41:08,344 --> 00:41:08,835
TRAVIS: Yeah.

737
00:41:08,835 --> 00:41:14,804
TALIESIN: It's much like those people who give you
instructions of how to survive an encounter with a

738
00:41:14,804 --> 00:41:18,883
tiger. It's that, you think about it, but you've
never actually met anybody who's said, "Yes, I've

739
00:41:18,883 --> 00:41:23,061
met a tiger, that's exactly what I did and I'm
fine." No, anybody who does that's probably been

740
00:41:23,061 --> 00:41:26,714
eaten anyway. It's a terrible idea. You don't try
and look bigger,

741
00:41:26,714 --> 00:41:29,359
you don't do any of that. You're gonna get eaten.

742
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:30,222
MARISHA: It's true.

743
00:41:30,222 --> 00:41:31,309
SAM: I've read some of those.

744
00:41:31,309 --> 00:41:34,855
TALIESIN: You survive an encounter by a tiger by
running really quickly in the other direction or

745
00:41:34,855 --> 00:41:36,787
hopefully hacking it to death before it kills
you.

746
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:37,976
SAM: All right.

747
00:41:37,976 --> 00:41:39,969
LIAM: You know, just between you and me, this does
sound really fucking stupid.

748
00:41:39,969 --> 00:41:40,747
MARISHA: Tigers aren't that bad.

749
00:41:40,747 --> 00:41:41,802
TALIESIN: Well, it was just my suggestion.

750
00:41:41,802 --> 00:41:48,298
TRAVIS: So, if four of us are fast water
creatures, right? Something that swims quick?

751
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:53,116
What's our diversion? I volunteer as tribute.

752
00:41:53,116 --> 00:41:57,334
MARISHA: Well, if you drop back down to zero hit
points, you'll revert back to your normal form,

753
00:41:57,334 --> 00:42:00,692
being able to water breathe, full hit points.

754
00:42:00,692 --> 00:42:04,812
TRAVIS: That would be a bad case scenario, 'cause
I'm really slow, in that case.

755
00:42:04,812 --> 00:42:05,581
MARISHA: Yes.

756
00:42:05,581 --> 00:42:06,880
TRAVIS: All sorts of fucked.

757
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,215
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

758
00:42:08,215 --> 00:42:12,409
TRAVIS: How many hit points does a killer whale
have?

759
00:42:12,409 --> 00:42:13,671
MARISHA: 90.

760
00:42:13,671 --> 00:42:15,535
TRAVIS: Oh, god, I thought you said nine. I nearly
shit my pants.

761
00:42:15,535 --> 00:42:16,720
MARISHA: 90.

762
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,409
TALIESIN: Let's see, what can we do?

763
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:23,031
MARISHA: I don't know if there's anything else
better.

764
00:42:23,031 --> 00:42:25,696
LAURA: The thing is, the kraken might be able to
swallow you whole, Grog.

765
00:42:25,696 --> 00:42:27,250
LIAM: Yeah.

766
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:27,852
TRAVIS: They have mouths?

767
00:42:27,852 --> 00:42:28,934
LAURA: I don't know how big they are.

768
00:42:28,934 --> 00:42:30,276
TRAVIS: No, they have tentacles.

769
00:42:30,276 --> 00:42:33,171
LAURA: No, but they've got-- Don't they have
beaks, like a squid?

770
00:42:33,171 --> 00:42:34,954
TRAVIS: I didn't hear anything about a beak or a
mouth.

771
00:42:34,954 --> 00:42:39,417
LIAM: Who hasn't seen a drawing of a squid or a
kraken in a fairy tale book? They're disgusting.

772
00:42:39,417 --> 00:42:41,063
TRAVIS: Book.

773
00:42:41,063 --> 00:42:51,813
TALIESIN: Maybe-- we have one night. Maybe I could
try and craft some sort of concussion explosive.

774
00:42:51,813 --> 00:42:53,201
MARISHA: I also don't want you tired tomorrow.

775
00:42:53,201 --> 00:42:56,361
TALIESIN: It wouldn't probably hurt it, but it
would at least maybe shock it. Give it a--

776
00:42:56,361 --> 00:42:59,604
stun it? To just blow something up underwater?

777
00:42:59,604 --> 00:43:02,486
MARISHA: There's something that I want to try
really quick, if you guys could back up or maybe

778
00:43:02,486 --> 00:43:05,551
get out of the water. I want to see if I can cast
spells underwater.

779
00:43:05,551 --> 00:43:06,685
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. I'm out.

780
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:08,052
TALIESIN: Well, all right.

781
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:10,900
MARISHA: I also want to see what lightning does,
so if you don't want to get electrocuted.

782
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,818
LIAM: As soon as those two start talking about
that, I get out of the water and

783
00:43:14,818 --> 00:43:18,133
start attuning the Deathwalker's Ward to 
lightning.

784
00:43:18,133 --> 00:43:18,841
MATT: Okay.

785
00:43:18,841 --> 00:43:20,363
TALIESIN: Very clever.

786
00:43:20,363 --> 00:43:21,585
MARISHA: I love that this is all under the
assumption that

787
00:43:21,585 --> 00:43:24,485
we just had this planning sesh underwater.

788
00:43:24,485 --> 00:43:25,801
LAURA: No, we were treading water.

789
00:43:25,801 --> 00:43:26,780
MARISHA: Oh, we're treading. Okay.

790
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:29,953
TRAVIS: I'm staying in the water because I wanna
feel the lightning.

791
00:43:29,953 --> 00:43:30,560
MARISHA: You wanna see?

792
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,514
TALIESIN: You wanna ride the lightning.

793
00:43:31,514 --> 00:43:32,286
TRAVIS: Yep.

794
00:43:32,286 --> 00:43:34,898
MARISHA: I'm gonna tread back from Grog, go
underwater,

795
00:43:34,898 --> 00:43:42,264
and I'm gonna do a Call Lightning
bolt. See what happens.

796
00:43:42,264 --> 00:43:51,565
MATT: Okay, Call Lightning, let me check real
fast. Yes, okay. So, you begin to speak

797
00:43:51,565 --> 00:43:56,506
underwater. (burbling noises) Spell isn't
coalescing.

798
00:43:56,506 --> 00:43:57,171
LAURA: Oh, no!

799
00:43:57,171 --> 00:44:00,111
MARISHA: Yeah, that's what I was curious about.
That's exactly what I wanted. All right, then how

800
00:44:00,111 --> 00:44:07,984
about this? I take out my Spire and I do a Chain
Lightning out of the Spire.

801
00:44:07,984 --> 00:44:14,029
MATT: Do Chain Lightning out of the Spire? As you
concentrate on the staff, the lightning arcs out

802
00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:18,565
of the staff and ends up searing and burning a
small section of

803
00:44:18,565 --> 00:44:21,219
the floating kelp vines that are
wandering up there.

804
00:44:21,219 --> 00:44:21,961
MARISHA: Okay.

805
00:44:21,961 --> 00:44:23,228
MATT: Clears a little area.

806
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:29,936
MARISHA: So I can cast out of the Spire. And--
cool.

807
00:44:29,936 --> 00:44:35,956
While I'm under there, I want to Beast Shape
into a killer whale.

808
00:44:35,956 --> 00:44:41,643
MATT: Okay. You turn into a killer whale. You
are-- it is about 15 feet deep, so you are

809
00:44:41,643 --> 00:44:46,335
occupying a large portion of the water nearby.
It's really hard to swim in this vicinity,

810
00:44:46,335 --> 00:44:49,790
especially with the density of kelp in the center
of this dip.

811
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:51,937
MARISHA: I goose Grog a little bit from
underneath.

812
00:44:51,937 --> 00:44:53,680
GROG: (yelps) I punch it.

813
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,529
(all laugh)

814
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:56,875
MATT: Okay, roll for an attack.

815
00:44:56,875 --> 00:45:01,354
TRAVIS: I was watching, but not that close. That
scared me, I'm sorry.

816
00:45:01,354 --> 00:45:03,524
TALIESIN: It's okay, it's an animal that already
has a black eye.

817
00:45:03,524 --> 00:45:04,307
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

818
00:45:04,307 --> 00:45:05,107
MARISHA: It's fine. (laughs)

819
00:45:05,107 --> 00:45:06,092
TRAVIS: 25.

820
00:45:06,092 --> 00:45:07,619
MATT: Okay. So, with your strength bonus--

821
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:09,104
MARISHA: (laughs) Uh, yeah. That definitely hits.

822
00:45:09,104 --> 00:45:11,221
MATT: -- you, (laughs), let's see. What's your
strength bonus?

823
00:45:11,221 --> 00:45:11,988
TRAVIS: Eight.

824
00:45:11,988 --> 00:45:15,697
MATT: Yeah, so you take, we'll say, nine points of
bludgeoning damage

825
00:45:15,697 --> 00:45:17,990
as Grog just smacks you in the nose.

826
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:19,018
LIAM: Right in the blubber.

827
00:45:19,018 --> 00:45:21,876
TALIESIN: To be fair, no worse than anything that
happens to a killer whale at SeaWorld at that point.

828
00:45:21,876 --> 00:45:22,688
MARISHA: (laughs)

829
00:45:22,688 --> 00:45:23,503
TRAVIS: Oh, that's terrible.

830
00:45:23,503 --> 00:45:25,895
TALIESIN: Yeah, I went there, I'm so sorry. It's
been there, I'm sorry!

831
00:45:25,895 --> 00:45:28,619
LAURA: Is there some sort of Alter Self spell
that--

832
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:29,584
MARISHA: (groans) Oh, no.

833
00:45:29,584 --> 00:45:30,969
LIAM: Change his alignment!

834
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:32,103
MARISHA: Oh, no.

835
00:45:32,103 --> 00:45:34,268
TALIESIN: My personal alignment is already so far
down.

836
00:45:34,268 --> 00:45:35,245
LIAM: (laughs)

837
00:45:35,245 --> 00:45:36,412
LAURA: Yeah, no, yeah, you're right.

838
00:45:36,412 --> 00:45:37,149
MATT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

839
00:45:37,149 --> 00:45:38,088
MARISHA: I drop form out of shame.

840
00:45:38,088 --> 00:45:39,344
(all laugh)

841
00:45:39,344 --> 00:45:40,208
TALIESIN: Sorry!

842
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:41,803
TRAVIS: Were you gonna-- you were gonna check your
speed or something?

843
00:45:41,803 --> 00:45:42,514
SAM: Oh.

844
00:45:42,514 --> 00:45:44,236
MARISHA: Well, I'm in like a tank.

845
00:45:44,236 --> 00:45:44,924
LAURA: Aw.

846
00:45:44,924 --> 00:45:47,904
MARISHA: Which is even worse, I know! This feels
tactless, I'm out!

847
00:45:47,904 --> 00:45:50,095
(all laugh)

848
00:45:50,095 --> 00:45:51,690
TALIESIN: Shit got real on Critical Role.

849
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:54,885
LAURA: I like how SeaWorld is was what was our
line. Of tactless.

850
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:57,461
TALIESIN: Yeah. Oh no, I know what--

851
00:45:57,461 --> 00:45:59,443
MARISHA: That's a good point!

852
00:45:59,443 --> 00:46:02,080
TRAVIS: All right Jesus Christ, let's move on!

853
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,490
TALIESIN: I know where my money is going at the
end of the evening.

854
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:08,599
LAURA: Is there an Alter Self sort of spell that
could make you be able to speak underwater? Is

855
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,906
there anything that you can do that allows for
speech?

856
00:46:11,906 --> 00:46:13,034
MARISHA: Well, if I do Alter Self--

857
00:46:13,034 --> 00:46:14,993
SAM: Did you do Alter Self just now?

858
00:46:14,993 --> 00:46:17,190
MARISHA: Let me actually try that. I Alter Self.

859
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:19,034
TRAVIS: Yeah. Oh. No polymorph.

860
00:46:19,034 --> 00:46:20,558
MARISHA: To be able to give myself--

861
00:46:20,558 --> 00:46:21,328
MATT: Gills, right.

862
00:46:21,328 --> 00:46:24,960
MARISHA: Gills, and like, fins and stuff, and
then-- now can I cast?

863
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,907
MATT: Unfortunately, because there's still water
passing through your throat and vocal cords. If

864
00:46:29,907 --> 00:46:36,173
you get a full breath of air, you can get one
spell off. And technically, with your breathing

865
00:46:36,173 --> 00:46:39,251
the water underneath, because you already had the
gills in, it didn't work. You get a breath of air,

866
00:46:39,251 --> 00:46:42,967
and you cast the spell as the air leaves your
lungs,

867
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:46,236
but once you cast the spell, the air is gone.

868
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:47,354
SAM: No more spells.

869
00:46:47,354 --> 00:46:49,627
LAURA: What about merpeople? How do they talk to
each other?

870
00:46:49,627 --> 00:46:50,754
SAM: (dolphin noises)

871
00:46:50,754 --> 00:46:52,068
LAURA: Are there really merpeople? There are
merpeople.

872
00:46:52,068 --> 00:46:53,039
LIAM: Frog sacs?

873
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:54,444
TALIESIN: They have a different larynx system.

874
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:55,890
TRAVIS: Dry-erase boards.

875
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:57,210
TALIESIN: (laughs) Wet-erase boards.

876
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:00,533
(all laugh)

877
00:47:00,533 --> 00:47:06,687
TALIESIN: I deserved what happened below the
table. Last weird question, would it be possible--

878
00:47:06,687 --> 00:47:14,801
could I basically just make a bag of air that we
could carry that she could breathe in and have to

879
00:47:14,801 --> 00:47:18,227
breathe it in before casting the spell. Is that
nuts?

880
00:47:18,227 --> 00:47:24,353
SAM: Well, if I may. The big fellow over there
said that he had some sort of vials that you could

881
00:47:24,353 --> 00:47:27,189
breathe air out of. Is that true?

882
00:47:27,189 --> 00:47:29,533
TRAVIS: They're supposed to let you breathe
underwater.

883
00:47:29,533 --> 00:47:32,732
I don't know if it pumps your guts
full of air or anything.

884
00:47:32,732 --> 00:47:34,401
SAM: May I examine it?

885
00:47:34,401 --> 00:47:36,697
LAURA: It's Water Breathing, it's the spell Water
Breathing.

886
00:47:36,697 --> 00:47:37,781
MARISHA: Yeah, what about my Water Breathing--

887
00:47:37,781 --> 00:47:38,561
SAM: No, it's not.

888
00:47:38,561 --> 00:47:39,787
MARISHA: -- we should still be able to talk?

889
00:47:39,787 --> 00:47:41,601
MATT: Water Breathing you can breathe the water,
but when you still--

890
00:47:41,601 --> 00:47:42,748
MARISHA: Okay, but you can't go (garbled
underwater noises).

891
00:47:42,748 --> 00:47:44,992
MATT: -- but you can't, yeah. It's still water
passing through the vocal cords--

892
00:47:44,992 --> 00:47:45,914
SAM: What is the thing that you have?

893
00:47:45,914 --> 00:47:47,824
MATT: -- which doesn't have the vibration to make
the same sound.

894
00:47:47,824 --> 00:47:49,346
MARISHA: I think it's a potion of waterbreathing.

895
00:47:49,346 --> 00:47:50,246
LAURA: What if we use some sort of--

896
00:47:50,246 --> 00:47:51,497
TRAVIS: Underwater breathing.

897
00:47:51,497 --> 00:47:55,978
LAURA: -- cap, right? On Grog's jug. And it just
makes air!

898
00:47:55,978 --> 00:47:57,854
SAM: Hm.

899
00:47:57,854 --> 00:47:58,855
LIAM: Not a bad thought.

900
00:47:58,855 --> 00:47:59,862
TALIESIN: Make a skin.

901
00:47:59,862 --> 00:48:02,583
MARISHA: Could I speak into the jug-- clearly.

902
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:05,983
TALIESIN: I was gonna say we could make a diving
bell. But it would be very hard to travel with,

903
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:07,125
but we could make a micro diving bell.

904
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:08,558
LAURA: (laughs)

905
00:48:08,558 --> 00:48:09,604
MARISHA: What is a diving bell?

906
00:48:09,604 --> 00:48:12,038
TRAVIS: You guys, this is getting dumber and
dumber. We will have a movement speed of one.

907
00:48:12,038 --> 00:48:13,923
TALIESIN: It's basically an upside-down pot that
you stick your head in

908
00:48:13,923 --> 00:48:16,356
and you take a big breath of air, but the 
problem is moving with it is bad.

909
00:48:16,356 --> 00:48:17,430
TRAVIS: We can't move it.

910
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:18,427
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

911
00:48:18,427 --> 00:48:19,606
TRAVIS: It'll go straight to the bottom.

912
00:48:19,606 --> 00:48:22,588
MARISHA: Killer whales?

913
00:48:22,588 --> 00:48:23,260
TRAVIS: Yep.

914
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,343
LAURA: Whales and riders.

915
00:48:24,343 --> 00:48:26,047
MARISHA: And-- all right. Who's whales, who's
riders?

916
00:48:26,047 --> 00:48:26,682
TALIESIN: Whales.

917
00:48:26,682 --> 00:48:27,555
TRAVIS: Whale.

918
00:48:27,555 --> 00:48:29,799
LIAM: Rider.

919
00:48:29,799 --> 00:48:31,597
MARISHA: Rider?

920
00:48:31,597 --> 00:48:36,098
LAURA: I guess I'll be a whale. Or Trinket could
be a whale!

921
00:48:36,098 --> 00:48:36,738
MARISHA: Trinket could be a whale.

922
00:48:36,738 --> 00:48:37,696
TALIESIN: Or a shark.

923
00:48:37,696 --> 00:48:38,924
LAURA: I will ride Trinket.

924
00:48:38,924 --> 00:48:40,397
TRAVIS: Well, it needs to be one of you two.

925
00:48:40,397 --> 00:48:41,522
TALIESIN: You might want to go shark for one of
them.

926
00:48:41,522 --> 00:48:45,911
TRAVIS: Trinket needs to go in the necklace 'cause
of the odd man out.

927
00:48:45,911 --> 00:48:47,721
SAM: Please don't leave me behind.

928
00:48:47,721 --> 00:48:49,122
MARISHA: I thought you were being a rider.

929
00:48:49,122 --> 00:48:50,407
SAM: I would love to, but, there's no one to
ride.

930
00:48:50,407 --> 00:48:53,688
LAURA: Can't we have two people on one whale? I
feel like whales are very large.

931
00:48:53,688 --> 00:48:54,889
SAM: That makes sense.

932
00:48:54,889 --> 00:48:56,024
MATT: You could muster that, yes.

933
00:48:56,024 --> 00:48:56,534
MARISHA: Yeah.

934
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:57,277
TRAVIS: Okay.

935
00:48:57,277 --> 00:49:02,628
TALIESIN: Especially if it's just handles, if it's
just like hanging onto a piece of rope.

936
00:49:02,628 --> 00:49:04,793
MARISHA: All right, let's go eat food.

937
00:49:04,793 --> 00:49:13,009
MATT: All right. You guys make your way out of the
small kelp farming area, eventually back to

938
00:49:13,009 --> 00:49:14,710
complete your-- you're doing a Heroes' Feast?

939
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:15,443
MARISHA: Yup.

940
00:49:15,443 --> 00:49:16,226
MATT: Okay, so mark--

941
00:49:16,226 --> 00:49:18,694
LAURA: But like ice cream, and donuts, like a
midnight snack kind of.

942
00:49:18,694 --> 00:49:19,496
TRAVIS: Easy, psycho.

943
00:49:19,496 --> 00:49:20,781
MATT: That is totally doable.

944
00:49:20,781 --> 00:49:21,774
LAURA: Like, waffles and--

945
00:49:21,774 --> 00:49:22,877
MARISHA: Hot fudge sundae.

946
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:23,550
LAURA: Yes.

947
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:24,638
LIAM: This is the meal I was waiting on.

948
00:49:24,638 --> 00:49:25,340
TALIESIN: A Heroes' Sundae Bar.

949
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:25,960
LAURA: Mm-hm.

950
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:30,797
MATT: The finest of gluttonous sweets available in
Tal'Dorei are summoned upon this fine mahogany

951
00:49:30,797 --> 00:49:34,816
table that thrusts itself out of the sand.
Everyone in the vicinity steps back and kind of,

952
00:49:34,816 --> 00:49:41,222
"Ooh, ahh," at this display of unexpected magic.
Other folks step forward to try and take a piece

953
00:49:41,222 --> 00:49:46,592
from it, before somebody else stops them with a
hand, "It's not for you!" You guys spend the next

954
00:49:46,592 --> 00:49:50,348
hour eating your meal, and gain the benefits of
your Heroes' Feast!

955
00:49:50,348 --> 00:49:51,667
(all cheer)

956
00:49:51,667 --> 00:49:53,802
MATT: So let's go ahead and--

957
00:49:53,802 --> 00:49:54,475
TRAVIS: Oh.

958
00:49:54,475 --> 00:49:55,499
TALIESIN: (sings Zelda music)

959
00:49:55,499 --> 00:49:56,475
LIAM: That's extra hit points, yeah?

960
00:49:56,475 --> 00:49:56,992
LAURA: Mm-hm!

961
00:49:56,992 --> 00:49:57,554
LIAM: How many?

962
00:49:57,554 --> 00:49:58,356
MARISHA: 2d10--

963
00:49:58,356 --> 00:49:59,697
MATT: Yeah, Marisha rolls for you guys--

964
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:00,706
LIAM: Roll for all of us.

965
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:05,906
MARISHA: -- which I will roll for you right now,
and we-- both are cocked. (singsong) Landed on the

966
00:50:05,906 --> 00:50:08,470
side. That one-- is that still cocked?

967
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:09,386
TALIESIN: That's cocked.

968
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:10,054
MARISHA: God damn it.

969
00:50:10,054 --> 00:50:11,102
TRAVIS: Take some of the dice out of your box.

970
00:50:11,102 --> 00:50:13,427
MARISHA: Shut up! An extra 11.

971
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:16,348
MATT: All right. So, 11 extra hit points to all
you guys.

972
00:50:16,348 --> 00:50:21,436
Including Trinket, who scarfs up happily at 
the table.

973
00:50:21,436 --> 00:50:22,348
LAURA: Yay!

974
00:50:22,348 --> 00:50:23,902
TALIESIN: 11 hit points

975
00:50:23,902 --> 00:50:27,861
LIAM: No fear, no poison, advantage on saves,
isn't it?

976
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:28,743
MARISHA: Wisdom saves.

977
00:50:28,743 --> 00:50:29,532
LIAM: Wisdom saves.

978
00:50:29,532 --> 00:50:30,822
MATT: Wisdom saves.

979
00:50:30,822 --> 00:50:33,106
TALIESIN: Wisdom saves. Advantage. No fear. No
poison.

980
00:50:33,106 --> 00:50:35,221
MARISHA: No fear, no poison, 2d10.

981
00:50:35,221 --> 00:50:36,424
LAURA: Lovely. All right.

982
00:50:36,424 --> 00:50:38,373
MATT: You got it.

983
00:50:38,373 --> 00:50:40,375
TRAVIS: Are we supposed to go research the 
lodestones before

984
00:50:40,375 --> 00:50:42,195
we go to bed, right? The ones that are failing?

985
00:50:42,462 --> 00:50:43,805
LAURA: Oh, maybe we could do it in the morning?

986
00:50:43,805 --> 00:50:45,513
MATT: The morning is what you were told.

987
00:50:45,513 --> 00:50:46,005
TRAVIS: Okay.

988
00:50:46,005 --> 00:50:47,755
MATT: Going to bring you to the the Aerie of
Torrent.

989
00:50:47,755 --> 00:50:49,293
TALIESIN: Are they heavy or are they light?

990
00:50:49,293 --> 00:50:50,705
LAURA: We'll find out.

991
00:50:50,705 --> 00:50:56,376
MATT: So. As you guys are brought to your sleeping
quarters, which are these semi-private huts

992
00:50:56,376 --> 00:51:03,598
elevated above the water, so they are actually
about half a foot above the surface. You are each

993
00:51:03,598 --> 00:51:14,155
given a small chest, a soaked damp chest like the
wood itself is just waterlogged through and

994
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:20,601
through. As you open it, on the inside each of you
receive what looks to be a leather band, with a

995
00:51:20,601 --> 00:51:22,863
circular stone affixed to the center of it.

996
00:51:22,863 --> 00:51:26,007
LAURA: If this is going to make us be able to
fucking talk underwater--

997
00:51:26,007 --> 00:51:30,747
MARISHA: Oh, that will be super frustrating if we
just took all that time.

998
00:51:30,747 --> 00:51:32,347
Or if this is one of those--

999
00:51:32,347 --> 00:51:34,408
TALIESIN: Vox Machina, solving problems that don't
need to be solved.

1000
00:51:34,408 --> 00:51:37,494
MARISHA: Solved-- making problems complicated for
five years.

1001
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:40,225
TRAVIS: Why don't we put it on and see what it
does?

1002
00:51:40,225 --> 00:51:41,072
MARISHA: Yeah.

1003
00:51:41,072 --> 00:51:46,603
MATT: Okay. What do you do? There's a cluster of
them at various--

1004
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:51,452
TRAVIS: Does the leather band attach at either
end?

1005
00:51:51,452 --> 00:51:56,377
MATT: It has almost like a rudimentary belt clasp
on both sides.

1006
00:51:56,471 --> 00:51:58,217
TRAVIS: I'm going to put it around my neck like a
dog collar,

1007
00:51:58,217 --> 00:52:02,511
and I'm going to lay down in the water face first.

1008
00:52:02,511 --> 00:52:04,928
MATT: Okay, it warms as it touches the outside of
the neck

1009
00:52:04,928 --> 00:52:08,324
and it feels like there's a very loose--
almost a vibration to it.

1010
00:52:08,324 --> 00:52:09,824
LAURA: (gasps) Talk, Grog!

1011
00:52:09,824 --> 00:52:11,604
TRAVIS: (distorted, vibrational voice) This is
really cool!

1012
00:52:11,604 --> 00:52:13,399
(all laugh)

1013
00:52:13,399 --> 00:52:15,358
TALIESIN: I put my ear in the water to see if I
can hear him.

1014
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:19,707
MATT: It does transfer your voice through the
water.

1015
00:52:19,707 --> 00:52:22,963
LAURA: That's awesome! What a waste of (sings)
fucking time!

1016
00:52:22,963 --> 00:52:23,984
TRAVIS: But, but--

1017
00:52:23,984 --> 00:52:24,647
MARISHA: That's great.

1018
00:52:24,647 --> 00:52:25,750
MATT: (laughs) You didn't go back to--

1019
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,612
TRAVIS: But does it remedy the spell problem?

1020
00:52:27,612 --> 00:52:28,245
LAURA: Yeah.

1021
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:28,840
TALIESIN: Yes.

1022
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:29,883
LIAM: Welcome to the cool kids' table, Tary.

1023
00:52:29,883 --> 00:52:30,410
MARISHA: It does.

1024
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:30,938
LAURA: It does.

1025
00:52:30,938 --> 00:52:31,897
MATT: Yeah, it does.

1026
00:52:31,897 --> 00:52:32,428
SAM: It's amazing.

1027
00:52:32,428 --> 00:52:33,928
MATT: You guys can talk under water. There is
still a limitation

1028
00:52:33,928 --> 00:52:36,246
to the distance you travel
'cause sound is, you know.

1029
00:52:36,246 --> 00:52:37,899
TALIESIN: Best of the best.

1030
00:52:37,899 --> 00:52:42,054
MATT: Actually, no sorry, the sound does travel
further.

1031
00:52:42,054 --> 00:52:42,964
TALIESIN: It does.

1032
00:52:42,964 --> 00:52:45,258
MATT: Underwater. Conduit.

1033
00:52:45,258 --> 00:52:47,689
LAURA: Oh. So we have to be super quiet.

1034
00:52:47,689 --> 00:52:53,237
MATT: However, you also look within the case and
each of them has what looks to be spherical,

1035
00:52:53,237 --> 00:52:57,581
somewhat see-through domes of some glass-like
material.

1036
00:52:57,581 --> 00:52:58,319
LAURA: (gasps)

1037
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,852
MATT: You are also affixed with goggles, and you
remember, looking back, you saw some of the people

1038
00:53:00,852 --> 00:53:06,044
who were part of the troupe here, especially the
guardians on the outside of the city, had the same

1039
00:53:06,137 --> 00:53:08,577
similar goggle sets hanging around their neck.

1040
00:53:08,577 --> 00:53:09,937
LIAM: Get the fuck out!

1041
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:11,010
LAURA: This is awesome!

1042
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:13,197
TALIESIN: Hello, water-based culture, would you
happen to have some goggles lying around we could

1043
00:53:13,197 --> 00:53:16,721
borrow, maybe something that's to communicate
underwater, I don't know?

1044
00:53:16,721 --> 00:53:18,235
LIAM: (makes ding noises to mimic hitting glass
dome)

1045
00:53:18,235 --> 00:53:18,864
MARISHA: We totally didn't.

1046
00:53:18,864 --> 00:53:20,820
MATT: Nobody asked-- but they were provided.

1047
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,340
MARISHA: We should have asked what equipment was
available.

1048
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:22,860
(all laugh)

1049
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:28,699
MATT: These are standard given to the Waveriders,
the guardians that look on the outskirts of Vesrah.

1050
00:53:28,699 --> 00:53:30,597
LAURA: What a fucking idiot.

1051
00:53:30,597 --> 00:53:31,427
MARISHA: I feel stupid.

1052
00:53:31,427 --> 00:53:32,792
LIAM: (gong noise)

1053
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:33,914
MATT: (laughs)

1054
00:53:33,914 --> 00:53:35,247
TRAVIS: Tary Jumbo--

1055
00:53:35,247 --> 00:53:37,212
LAURA: We don't have giant domes on our heads.

1056
00:53:37,212 --> 00:53:38,521
LIAM: I do.

1057
00:53:38,521 --> 00:53:39,561
(all laugh)

1058
00:53:39,561 --> 00:53:41,445
TRAVIS: I just thought of one thing for you,
right? I went fishing this one time--

1059
00:53:41,445 --> 00:53:42,324
MATT: Just goggles.

1060
00:53:42,324 --> 00:53:47,005
TRAVIS: -- and the lure that I had was really
shiny and sparkly, like fish love sparkly things

1061
00:53:47,005 --> 00:53:53,584
in the water. And I'm just noticing now that you
are really shiny and sparkly kind of all over.

1062
00:53:53,584 --> 00:53:54,305
LAURA: Oh.

1063
00:53:54,305 --> 00:53:55,097
SAM: Like a lure?

1064
00:53:55,097 --> 00:53:55,871
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1065
00:53:55,871 --> 00:53:58,339
TALIESIN: I was actually just contemplating that,
because you know how frustrated

1066
00:53:58,339 --> 00:54:00,358
you get opening up a crab when you're 
going to eat it--

1067
00:54:00,358 --> 00:54:02,076
TRAVIS: I lost you at like the third word.

1068
00:54:02,076 --> 00:54:05,292
TALIESIN: I wonder, would it be ironic if the
kraken gets frustrated trying to peel off the

1069
00:54:05,292 --> 00:54:09,580
armor? It'd just be a wonderful irony. I'm so
sorry, sir.

1070
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,000
LIAM: I mean, that's funny, but it doesn't sound
safe.

1071
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:11,444
TALIESIN: No.

1072
00:54:11,444 --> 00:54:13,740
TRAVIS: What if we paint you in like black paint,
or poo.

1073
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:16,895
MARISHA: Oh yeah, and that will immediately go
away--

1074
00:54:16,895 --> 00:54:17,753
LAURA: Oh yeah, that's smart.

1075
00:54:17,753 --> 00:54:18,768
MARISHA: As we go underwater.

1076
00:54:18,768 --> 00:54:19,857
LAURA: Oh.

1077
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:20,898
TRAVIS: All right, paint it is. Or tar.

1078
00:54:20,898 --> 00:54:21,655
LAURA: Alter Self?

1079
00:54:21,655 --> 00:54:22,640
TRAVIS: Should we tar him?

1080
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,727
MARISHA: If you Alter Self, right?

1081
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:24,594
TALIESIN: I don't know. Let's--

1082
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:25,635
MARISHA: Can you make yourself darkish?

1083
00:54:25,635 --> 00:54:26,545
LAURA: Maybe you should be a whale.

1084
00:54:26,545 --> 00:54:27,763
TALIESIN: Just not reflective.

1085
00:54:27,763 --> 00:54:34,518
SAM: I don't like any of this. When I was treading
water before, was it difficult in armor? Was it--

1086
00:54:34,518 --> 00:54:35,116
MATT: Yeah!

1087
00:54:35,116 --> 00:54:39,244
(all laugh)

1088
00:54:39,244 --> 00:54:43,313
SAM: And if I were to remove my armor, would I be
weak and squishy?

1089
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:44,115
TRAVIS: You already are.

1090
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:44,786
MATT: Yes.

1091
00:54:44,786 --> 00:54:46,062
(all laugh)

1092
00:54:46,062 --> 00:54:47,544
MATT: That's a valid point.

1093
00:54:47,544 --> 00:54:49,565
TALIESIN: That's a very fair point.

1094
00:54:49,565 --> 00:54:55,448
MATT: You have a breastplate, right?

1095
00:54:55,448 --> 00:54:56,481
SAM: Uh-huh.

1096
00:54:56,481 --> 00:55:04,157
MATT: Actually, it's heavy, but it's not super
impeding you. It's heavy, but from a mechanical

1097
00:55:04,157 --> 00:55:07,161
standpoint, it doesn't make it more difficult for
you to swim.

1098
00:55:07,161 --> 00:55:11,334
It's just more of a (heavy breathing). Yeah.

1099
00:55:11,334 --> 00:55:12,399
SAM: But it's shiny.

1100
00:55:12,399 --> 00:55:13,727
MATT: It is shiny. Your armor is shiny.

1101
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,722
TRAVIS: What if we put you, like, in a potato
sack?

1102
00:55:15,722 --> 00:55:18,892
So, you've still got your armor but it just 
doesn't twinkle.

1103
00:55:18,892 --> 00:55:20,292
LIAM: That's not a bad idea at all.

1104
00:55:20,292 --> 00:55:21,894
TALIESIN: He is not wrong, and that's not a bad
idea.

1105
00:55:21,894 --> 00:55:23,225
LAURA: Is there any burlap around?

1106
00:55:23,225 --> 00:55:24,775
SAM: I have a robe, I have a robe.

1107
00:55:24,775 --> 00:55:25,938
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

1108
00:55:25,938 --> 00:55:27,674
SAM: I can just wrap myself in my robe.

1109
00:55:27,674 --> 00:55:30,231
LIAM: It's not just as flashy as the armor though,
is it?

1110
00:55:30,231 --> 00:55:32,886
SAM: It has some colorful patches on it, yes. But
they're not shiny.

1111
00:55:32,886 --> 00:55:34,982
LAURA: What if I stitch up the front?

1112
00:55:34,982 --> 00:55:35,643
TRAVIS: No, no. Potato sack.

1113
00:55:35,643 --> 00:55:39,002
LAURA: I just would hate for it to open up. I'm
just gonna-- do you mind? If I just--

1114
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:39,759
MARISHA: Well, if it's dark--

1115
00:55:39,759 --> 00:55:40,680
SAM: Stitch up the front of my robe?

1116
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:41,934
LAURA: I'm really good at sewing.

1117
00:55:41,934 --> 00:55:42,709
TRAVIS: Better not be flashy.

1118
00:55:42,709 --> 00:55:44,928
SAM: All right, I would, yes, thank you.

1119
00:55:44,928 --> 00:55:46,153
LAURA: Yeah, I stitch up the front.

1120
00:55:46,153 --> 00:55:47,050
MATT: Okay.

1121
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:47,987
SAM: Thank you.

1122
00:55:47,987 --> 00:55:49,433
LAURA: It'll be like a choir robe for you.

1123
00:55:49,433 --> 00:55:50,457
LIAM: Good idea, Grog.

1124
00:55:50,457 --> 00:55:51,928
LAURA: Yeah, that was smart.

1125
00:55:51,928 --> 00:55:53,372
SAM: Thank you so much.

1126
00:55:53,372 --> 00:55:54,915
TRAVIS: Thanks. I go fishing a lot.

1127
00:55:54,915 --> 00:55:57,832
SAM: You lot are taking good care of me. I
appreciate that.

1128
00:55:57,832 --> 00:56:00,852
Thank you. This is going to be fun! 
Right? Tomorrow?

1129
00:56:00,852 --> 00:56:01,970
LAURA: Fun, fun, fun!

1130
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:02,676
TALIESIN: Fun.

1131
00:56:02,676 --> 00:56:03,321
SAM: Yes?

1132
00:56:03,321 --> 00:56:03,963
LIAM: Scary fun.

1133
00:56:03,963 --> 00:56:04,792
TALIESIN: Scary fun.

1134
00:56:04,792 --> 00:56:05,682
SAM: All right.

1135
00:56:05,682 --> 00:56:06,687
MARISHA: So much fun.

1136
00:56:06,687 --> 00:56:08,409
TALIESIN: Technically speaking, we can't quite
feel fear at the moment, can we?

1137
00:56:08,409 --> 00:56:10,487
Or is it just a general malaise of fear?

1138
00:56:10,487 --> 00:56:12,120
(all laugh)

1139
00:56:12,479 --> 00:56:15,041
MARISHA: Yeah, I like, I like the latter. Malaise
of fear.

1140
00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:18,040
LAURA: I start working on the robe.

1141
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,570
MATT: All right.

1142
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:21,399
LAURA: Really ugly stitches.

1143
00:56:21,399 --> 00:56:25,811
MATT: Yeah, it's, I mean, it takes you a while to
get through the whole robe and get it done, and

1144
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:30,179
it's functional more than visually appealing. But
you get the job done.

1145
00:56:30,272 --> 00:56:37,515
SAM: This reminds me of one of my caretakers when
I was younger, stitching up some of my play

1146
00:56:37,515 --> 00:56:41,021
clothes. It's a nice feeling. Thank you so much.

1147
00:56:41,021 --> 00:56:43,254
LAURA: You're welcome, darling.

1148
00:56:43,254 --> 00:56:46,803
MARISHA: While they're winding down, can I sneak
away and see if I can find Uvenda?

1149
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:53,114
MATT: Sure! It's not too difficult. She's in the
same seat, snoring loudly, while two of her

1150
00:56:53,114 --> 00:56:57,730
guardians stand at the side with their thin,
polearm-like blades

1151
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:04,908
just watching as you approach, and she's
just like (snores).

1152
00:57:04,908 --> 00:57:13,013
MARISHA: I turn to her guards and say, do I wake
her up? Does she not like being-- I don't want to

1153
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:18,365
be rude! But I kinda need to talk to her and I'm
only here for a few more hours, and I--

1154
00:57:18,365 --> 00:57:20,983
MATT: One of them takes his bladed trident and
hits her

1155
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:24,254
just gently on the side with the butt of
it. She goes (snorts awake).

1156
00:57:24,254 --> 00:57:25,723
MARISHA: Ah, that's how you do it.

1157
00:57:25,723 --> 00:57:31,383
MATT: "Ugh, yes, young Keyleth, hm."

1158
00:57:31,383 --> 00:57:32,077
MARISHA: Hi.

1159
00:57:32,077 --> 00:57:36,304
MATT: She leans forward, putting on the
presentation, but you can hear just that slight

1160
00:57:36,304 --> 00:57:42,790
undertone of frustration. "What can I do for
you?"

1161
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:51,383
MARISHA: Uh, yeah. I was just curious. I'm so
sorry, first off--

1162
00:57:51,383 --> 00:57:52,942
MATT: "Keep talking, please. What do you want?"

1163
00:57:52,942 --> 00:57:54,918
(all laugh)

1164
00:57:54,918 --> 00:58:08,295
MARISHA: You mentioned that there were only
remnants of my mother that came back. Was she

1165
00:58:08,295 --> 00:58:12,167
defeated by the kraken, or do you think this was
from another means?

1166
00:58:12,167 --> 00:58:19,938
Do you have any more information on her?

1167
00:58:19,938 --> 00:58:27,423
MATT: "Child. There was little left of her and her
allies. We found other pieces of her friends, but,

1168
00:58:27,423 --> 00:58:41,077
"pieces. Her leg was all we found. We could not
recover much else, but the sea floor is littered

1169
00:58:41,077 --> 00:58:48,640
"with the many corpses and pieces of the kraken's
various prey.

1170
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:54,845
"It does not take much to ascertain
the nature of her end."

1171
00:58:54,845 --> 00:59:00,406
MARISHA: And you're sure of this? This is what the
kraken does to people?

1172
00:59:00,406 --> 00:59:06,844
MATT: "What it does to anything that crosses its
path. It eats to survive."

1173
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:13,033
MARISHA: Hm. I was just wondering. If there was
any other potential explanation or--?

1174
00:59:13,033 --> 00:59:18,370
MATT: "I'm sure there is. There are many potential
possibilities for anything that happens. I only

1175
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:26,931
"have the information I was able to glean from the
various scouts and teams."

1176
00:59:26,931 --> 00:59:29,289
MARISHA: How long ago was this?

1177
00:59:29,289 --> 00:59:34,754
MATT: "This was four, five years back?"

1178
00:59:34,754 --> 00:59:44,553
MARISHA: Really? All right. That's not that long,
really. Did she stay long?

1179
00:59:44,553 --> 00:59:52,759
MATT: "A few days. Prepared for the journey much
like you did. That was the last we saw of them."

1180
00:59:52,759 --> 00:59:59,323
MARISHA: All right. I was just curious. Thank
you.

1181
00:59:59,323 --> 01:00:02,388
MATT: "I wish I had different news for you."

1182
01:00:02,388 --> 01:00:10,620
MARISHA: Did you keep anything? From what you
found?

1183
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:18,301
MATT: Her head turns curiously. "I fear I did not."

1184
01:00:18,379 --> 01:00:21,303
MARISHA: Okay.

1185
01:00:21,303 --> 01:00:29,637
MATT: "We gave a quiet burial to what we were able
to recover, but that's all."

1186
01:00:29,637 --> 01:00:34,955
MARISHA: Well, I appreciate that much. Thank you
for doing that.

1187
01:00:34,955 --> 01:00:39,932
MATT: "Of course, and once again, I am sorry for
your loss, Keyleth."

1188
01:00:39,932 --> 01:00:43,581
MARISHA: Oh. It's part of the duty.

1189
01:00:43,581 --> 01:00:46,571
MATT: "Yes. Yes, it is."

1190
01:00:46,571 --> 01:00:49,657
MARISHA: Well, I should be getting my rest.

1191
01:00:49,657 --> 01:00:50,537
MATT: "Yes, you should."

1192
01:00:50,537 --> 01:00:56,113
MARISHA: Yeah, big day! Swimming! Lots of
calories! I'm gonna go now.

1193
01:00:56,113 --> 01:00:57,029
MATT: "Yes."

1194
01:00:57,029 --> 01:00:57,674
MARISHA: All right, bye.

1195
01:00:57,674 --> 01:00:58,796
MATT: "Yes, you will. Goodbye."

1196
01:00:58,796 --> 01:01:00,133
MARISHA: Goodnight.

1197
01:01:00,133 --> 01:01:08,734
MATT: (snores) Just conks right out again.
Anything else you guys wish to do for the evening?

1198
01:01:08,734 --> 01:01:10,606
LIAM: Well, I'm gonna follow Keyleth back to our
room.

1199
01:01:10,606 --> 01:01:11,598
MATT: Mm-hm.

1200
01:01:11,598 --> 01:01:17,131
LIAM: You all right?

1201
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:22,840
MARISHA: Did you just follow me? Were you
following me just now?

1202
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,152
LIAM: No, I was waiting outside the door.

1203
01:01:24,152 --> 01:01:30,772
MARISHA: Oh! All right, okay, yeah. Sorry. No, I'm
good, I'm good.

1204
01:01:30,772 --> 01:01:38,694
LIAM: I've seen the trouble behind your eyes all
day, not surprisingly, yeah?

1205
01:01:38,694 --> 01:01:40,134
MARISHA: I'm great.

1206
01:01:40,134 --> 01:01:41,351
LIAM: Yeah?

1207
01:01:41,351 --> 01:01:42,651
MARISHA: Yeah.

1208
01:01:42,651 --> 01:01:43,419
LIAM: Okay.

1209
01:01:43,419 --> 01:01:49,285
MARISHA: A lot, yeah. A lot riding on this, but--
A little surreal that we're here.

1210
01:01:49,285 --> 01:01:51,292
LIAM: Long time coming.

1211
01:01:51,292 --> 01:01:52,589
MARISHA: Yeah.

1212
01:01:52,589 --> 01:01:59,318
LIAM: You know, you are already a river to your
people.

1213
01:01:59,427 --> 01:02:02,462
MARISHA: What?

1214
01:02:02,462 --> 01:02:15,702
LIAM: I know that your life has built up to this
moment in many respects. But your father is very

1215
01:02:15,702 --> 01:02:31,561
proud of you. You've already done a lot. You
silenced that dragon. You've done a lot.

1216
01:02:31,561 --> 01:02:35,839
MARISHA: I'm just glad I have you all.

1217
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:43,627
LIAM: You know, I know that you struggle with
doubt, and I don't think it's ever gonna go away

1218
01:02:43,627 --> 01:02:59,340
for any of us. Especially for you. I think that's
part of the job you're getting ready for. But I

1219
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:06,732
don't see it as a weakness. You know, all this
time I've remembered Uriel.

1220
01:03:06,732 --> 01:03:18,654
I'm not big on monarchies and the like, 
but I liked him.

1221
01:03:18,654 --> 01:03:20,363
MARISHA: He was a good man.

1222
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:30,936
LIAM: Yeah. May his soul rest. And he had doubts.
And he let them inform his decisions, and tried to

1223
01:03:30,936 --> 01:03:49,434
do what was right. And the questions you have, I
think they speak to your character.

1224
01:03:49,434 --> 01:03:55,868
MARISHA: Uriel was also blinded by his unknowance
of a lot of problems,

1225
01:03:55,868 --> 01:04:03,622
so I just hope I don't follow in his footsteps 
in that regard.

1226
01:04:03,622 --> 01:04:13,519
LIAM: Well, all the matters is what we leave
behind us when we go. You've already done a lot of

1227
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:34,628
good. And you've taught me to be happy again. I'm
very grateful to you. So, thank you.

1228
01:04:34,628 --> 01:04:40,436
MARISHA: Thank you. For believing in me.

1229
01:04:40,436 --> 01:04:45,276
LIAM: You make that easy.

1230
01:04:45,276 --> 01:04:49,306
MARISHA: Anyway, we should get some sleep. It's a
big day tomorrow.

1231
01:04:49,306 --> 01:05:14,145
LIAM: Yeah. You know, I noticed, about a week ago?
You were curious about my wings. I shoot them out.

1232
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:21,055
MARISHA: Heehee, hee. I pet them a little.

1233
01:05:21,055 --> 01:05:29,814
LIAM: We have one hour. Fade to feathers.

1234
01:05:29,814 --> 01:05:31,221
LAURA: (gasps)

1235
01:05:31,221 --> 01:05:34,197
(all laugh)

1236
01:05:34,197 --> 01:05:39,150
LAURA: (beatboxing)

1237
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:41,478
SAM: Skyfuck!

1238
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,572
LAURA: Oh, shit!

1239
01:05:45,572 --> 01:05:48,804
TRAVIS: I just want Vax and Keyleth to do the
original Superman

1240
01:05:48,804 --> 01:05:51,618
movie dialogue while he and Lois are flying.

1241
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:52,801
MARISHA: Oh god, that weird poetry!

1242
01:05:52,801 --> 01:05:53,892
(all laugh)

1243
01:05:53,892 --> 01:05:54,490
LAURA: Oh yeah--

1244
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:56,059
TRAVIS: "Can you hear my thoughts?"

1245
01:05:56,059 --> 01:05:58,678
MATT: Just like slow narration of Keyleth
disembodied

1246
01:05:58,678 --> 01:06:01,135
as they're both just flying over Vesrah at night.

1247
01:06:01,135 --> 01:06:02,072
TALIESIN: I have a thing just for you.

1248
01:06:02,072 --> 01:06:03,033
MARISHA: Is he God?

1249
01:06:03,033 --> 01:06:04,178
TRAVIS: "Can you read my mind?"

1250
01:06:04,178 --> 01:06:05,266
(all laugh)

1251
01:06:05,266 --> 01:06:08,785
MATT: Perfect.

1252
01:06:08,785 --> 01:06:09,639
LIAM: I don't think they went anywhere.

1253
01:06:09,639 --> 01:06:10,633
MATT: That's perfect.

1254
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:11,889
TALIESIN: Just for you! Pass that down later.

1255
01:06:11,889 --> 01:06:16,180
MATT: All righty, so! Anyone else doing anything
else?

1256
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,676
TALIESIN: I'm collecting some seashells, and
taking a bit of a walk.

1257
01:06:18,676 --> 01:06:20,244
MATT: Okay.

1258
01:06:20,244 --> 01:06:21,557
LIAM: Derp.

1259
01:06:21,557 --> 01:06:23,014
TALIESIN: And eventually, we're chilling.

1260
01:06:23,014 --> 01:06:23,705
LAURA: Yeah.

1261
01:06:23,705 --> 01:06:24,483
MATT: Okay.

1262
01:06:24,483 --> 01:06:25,863
LAURA: I'm gonna brush Trinket.

1263
01:06:25,863 --> 01:06:26,726
MATT: (disgruntled bear noises)

1264
01:06:26,726 --> 01:06:28,045
LAURA: You need it! You're dirty!

1265
01:06:28,045 --> 01:06:31,436
(all laugh)

1266
01:06:31,436 --> 01:06:34,154
MATT: (more disgruntled bear noises) It's various
knots and seawater clusters--

1267
01:06:34,154 --> 01:06:36,307
LAURA: Yeah. Just gross.

1268
01:06:36,307 --> 01:06:41,819
MATT: It's just not fun. All right, so morning
comes to, the sun rises, it's a warm day. But the

1269
01:06:41,819 --> 01:06:44,876
waters are crystalline and beautiful as soon as
you step out. And since you haven't been here

1270
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:50,999
during the daytime, you can see it's a
paradise-like existence. The sands that fall

1271
01:06:50,999 --> 01:06:57,149
beneath the waves are white, just bright bleached
white, and the entire city seems like the middle

1272
01:06:57,149 --> 01:07:04,494
of this distant, tropical paradise. The islands
that do kind of flank in a triangular position, as

1273
01:07:04,494 --> 01:07:11,313
the islands of Anamn, they are just lush and green
and dense. You see no signs of civilization built

1274
01:07:11,313 --> 01:07:18,170
across them. They are just unending canopies that
swarm these masses of land that break past the

1275
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:23,058
ocean's surface in the distance, but here in
Vesrah, the city cluster, it's beautiful. The

1276
01:07:23,058 --> 01:07:29,890
water has almost a turquoise-type shimmer when you
see the areas that are deeper. And you see, in

1277
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:35,619
various sections, where the sand drifts away, the
sandbank vanishes into the reef, and there you can

1278
01:07:35,619 --> 01:07:39,408
see just an array of colors that refract beneath
the water's surface,

1279
01:07:39,408 --> 01:07:42,211
as a gentle breeze kind of blows through 
in sections.

1280
01:07:42,211 --> 01:07:43,625
LIAM: I want to go to there.

1281
01:07:43,625 --> 01:07:45,814
MATT: It's beautiful.

1282
01:07:45,814 --> 01:07:50,670
LAURA: I want to spend the morning, before anyone
else gets up, standing on the edge of the water

1283
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:54,872
and like letting my toes sink deeper and deeper as
the waves--

1284
01:07:54,872 --> 01:07:55,854
LIAM: That's nice.

1285
01:07:55,854 --> 01:08:02,825
MATT: Okay. You guys eventually gather your way
for a morning meal, and you can see in the

1286
01:08:02,825 --> 01:08:08,052
distance now some of the Waverunners are doing
perimeters. And you can see that they have large

1287
01:08:08,052 --> 01:08:15,659
sails that are up on these triangular-like pointed
boards that curve up into horn-like javelins in

1288
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:20,056
the front, and they are coasting on them.
Basically surfing across the waves in the

1289
01:08:20,056 --> 01:08:22,324
distance, doing runs around the perimeter of the
reef.

1290
01:08:22,324 --> 01:08:23,291
LAURA: That's fucking sick!

1291
01:08:23,291 --> 01:08:24,039
MARISHA: That's so cool!

1292
01:08:24,039 --> 01:08:24,811
LIAM: Cool!

1293
01:08:24,811 --> 01:08:27,445
MATT: And they are wearing the same goggles and
the same throat pieces you were given.

1294
01:08:27,445 --> 01:08:28,083
LAURA: Ah!

1295
01:08:28,083 --> 01:08:29,801
MATT: This is part of the standard equipment that
is given to

1296
01:08:29,801 --> 01:08:33,679
the Waveriders as they check on the
outside and the vicinity of Vesrah.

1297
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:37,571
LIAM: That one looks like Keanu Reeves! And that
one looks like Patrick Swayze!

1298
01:08:37,571 --> 01:08:39,920
(all laugh)

1299
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:44,745
SAM: (Keanu Reeves as Johnny Utah impression) He's
not coming back.

1300
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:52,606
MATT: It's a clear sky, not a cloud visible.
Beautiful blue above you. What do you do to prepare?

1301
01:08:52,606 --> 01:08:54,051
LIAM: Oh, Jesus.

1302
01:08:54,051 --> 01:08:55,633
MARISHA: Oh, I find Uvenda.

1303
01:08:55,633 --> 01:08:57,739
MATT: Okay. She's actually already waiting for
you, as you guys--

1304
01:08:57,739 --> 01:09:00,270
she's been up, earlier than you were, and--

1305
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:06,999
MARISHA: I take some time in my morning prep to do
a little meditation, and I take my flame hands and

1306
01:09:06,999 --> 01:09:13,866
I do some like, traditional Ashari war paint,
kinda thing, going on.

1307
01:09:13,866 --> 01:09:14,620
TRAVIS: Sick.

1308
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:15,396
LAURA: Nice.

1309
01:09:15,396 --> 01:09:16,226
MARISHA: Yeah.

1310
01:09:16,226 --> 01:09:17,406
MATT: Nice, okay.

1311
01:09:17,406 --> 01:09:18,740
MARISHA: Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1312
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:21,744
TALIESIN: Are we bringing the bear?

1313
01:09:21,744 --> 01:09:22,128
LAURA: Yeah.

1314
01:09:22,128 --> 01:09:23,025
TALIESIN: We're bringing the bear.

1315
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:24,325
LAURA: Trinket's gonna be a whale.

1316
01:09:24,325 --> 01:09:24,927
MARISHA: Mm-hm.

1317
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:25,603
TALIESIN: All right.

1318
01:09:25,603 --> 01:09:27,607
LIAM: Hopefully the whole time.

1319
01:09:27,607 --> 01:09:31,406
MARISHA: As long as he doesn't hit zero hit
points, then he won't turn into a bear.

1320
01:09:31,406 --> 01:09:33,116
But he has water breathing!

1321
01:09:33,116 --> 01:09:34,616
LAURA: If he hits zero, okay, I have a question.

1322
01:09:34,616 --> 01:09:35,279
MATT: Yes.

1323
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:36,686
LAURA: If he hits zero hit points--

1324
01:09:36,686 --> 01:09:37,935
MARISHA: As a whale.

1325
01:09:37,935 --> 01:09:39,169
LAURA: Does he go into the--

1326
01:09:39,169 --> 01:09:40,004
MATT: No.

1327
01:09:40,004 --> 01:09:40,798
SAM: Trinket-form.

1328
01:09:40,798 --> 01:09:41,642
MATT: The form reverts--

1329
01:09:41,642 --> 01:09:42,512
LAURA: Would revert, and then--

1330
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:45,645
MATT: Becomes Trinket at full hit points, carrying
over any damage that happens. And remember only

1331
01:09:45,645 --> 01:09:50,084
Trinket's, or any of your natural form, maintains
the bonus hit points from your Heroes' Feast.

1332
01:09:50,084 --> 01:09:52,915
Your animal form does not.

1333
01:09:52,915 --> 01:09:54,042
LAURA: Okay.

1334
01:09:54,042 --> 01:09:56,831
MATT: So, you just have the base hit points of
whatever creature form you take, and once you go

1335
01:09:56,831 --> 01:09:59,896
to zero and revert back to yourself, or just
revert back to yourself,

1336
01:09:59,896 --> 01:10:02,090
then you have your hit points plus the 
Heroes' Feast.

1337
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:06,163
LIAM: And gameplay mechanics, can Trinket get
walloped so hard that it passes

1338
01:10:06,163 --> 01:10:11,074
all of his new form, plus Trinket form, 
and take him out?

1339
01:10:11,074 --> 01:10:13,490
MATT: If it was a shit-ton of damage, yeah.

1340
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:19,522
LAURA: It would have to be 150 points of damage.
Thereabouts, 160.

1341
01:10:19,522 --> 01:10:23,822
TALIESIN: Is it possible to grab a spare set of
goggles and choker, just in case?

1342
01:10:23,822 --> 01:10:26,590
MATT: Asking around--

1343
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:27,730
TALIESIN: We'll return them all.

1344
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:32,562
MATT: -- you approach Uvenda to ask this question.
Even as you approach, they're looking out in the

1345
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:36,223
distance. She says, "Yes, that could be certainly
mustered."

1346
01:10:36,223 --> 01:10:38,368
And she snaps her little gnomish fingers.

1347
01:10:38,368 --> 01:10:39,134
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1348
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:41,765
MATT: And one of the guards wanders off, comes
back a few moments later and retrieves an extra

1349
01:10:41,765 --> 01:10:44,497
pair of goggles, and the throat bead.

1350
01:10:44,497 --> 01:10:45,345
TALIESIN: Excellent.

1351
01:10:45,345 --> 01:10:46,925
MATT: And it's called a throat bead.

1352
01:10:46,925 --> 01:10:48,321
ALL: Throat bead.

1353
01:10:48,321 --> 01:10:52,945
SAM: How many of us need my coins to become
altered?

1354
01:10:52,945 --> 01:10:56,125
TRAVIS: I need to be a whale.

1355
01:10:56,125 --> 01:10:56,899
MARISHA: That's me.

1356
01:10:56,899 --> 01:10:57,716
TALIESIN: Three.

1357
01:10:57,716 --> 01:11:01,378
LIAM: So, riders, show of hands. Rider, rider?

1358
01:11:01,378 --> 01:11:04,976
LAURA: I mean, I can just use Water Breathing and
cast Pass Without a Trace on us,

1359
01:11:04,976 --> 01:11:08,537
that's the only thing, is I can't do that if I 
have Alter Self.

1360
01:11:08,537 --> 01:11:11,320
SAM: Oh, well then, I can just--

1361
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:15,965
MARISHA: Well, if you cast Pass Without a Trace,
it's a concentration spell--

1362
01:11:15,965 --> 01:11:17,690
SAM: You won't be able to swim very fast, though.

1363
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:19,044
LAURA: If what?

1364
01:11:19,044 --> 01:11:23,400
SAM: She can't use Alter Self and Pass Without a
Trace.

1365
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,807
MARISHA: Is Alter Self a concentration spell?

1366
01:11:24,807 --> 01:11:25,651
SAM: Yes.

1367
01:11:25,651 --> 01:11:28,079
MARISHA: Oh. I could cast Pass Without a Trace,
though.

1368
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:28,644
LAURA: Okay.

1369
01:11:28,644 --> 01:11:29,565
MARISHA: I did bring it today.

1370
01:11:29,565 --> 01:11:30,574
LAURA: Oh, good. All right.

1371
01:11:30,574 --> 01:11:36,114
MARISHA: I could-- yeah. Wait.

1372
01:11:36,114 --> 01:11:40,622
TRAVIS: Are there any seashells on the floor that
I could find? Pretty shells?

1373
01:11:40,622 --> 01:11:42,434
TALIESIN: I've already got a small bag of them, if
you want to keep them--

1374
01:11:42,434 --> 01:11:43,449
TRAVIS: I don't want yours.

1375
01:11:43,449 --> 01:11:44,832
MATT: So Alter Self is a what-level spell?

1376
01:11:44,832 --> 01:11:45,841
TALIESIN: We could trade later.

1377
01:11:45,841 --> 01:11:46,601
MARISHA: One. Two.

1378
01:11:46,601 --> 01:11:49,449
MATT: You have three second-level spells you can
cast. And two thirds.

1379
01:11:49,449 --> 01:11:51,951
So you'd have to use one of your third-level 
spells to do that.

1380
01:11:51,951 --> 01:11:52,622
SAM: Yeah.

1381
01:11:52,622 --> 01:11:53,722
TALIESIN: Also a skipping stone.

1382
01:11:53,722 --> 01:11:54,451
MARISHA: Right.

1383
01:11:54,451 --> 01:11:55,378
MATT: Technically, you could do--

1384
01:11:55,378 --> 01:11:55,988
SAM: I need one for me.

1385
01:11:55,988 --> 01:11:56,993
TALIESIN: You didn't think of that, did you?

1386
01:11:56,993 --> 01:11:57,843
SAM: So four of them.

1387
01:11:57,843 --> 01:12:02,700
MATT: You are correct.

1388
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:05,760
LAURA: You're a rider?

1389
01:12:05,882 --> 01:12:07,209
TRAVIS: I'm a whale.

1390
01:12:07,209 --> 01:12:13,714
MARISHA: Animal Shapes takes my concentration, so
I can't do that. But you could cast it--

1391
01:12:13,714 --> 01:12:16,984
SAM: You could just have Water Breathing, and be
riding a whale.

1392
01:12:16,984 --> 01:12:20,621
But if you get tossed from the
whale, can you swim?

1393
01:12:20,621 --> 01:12:24,756
LAURA: I mean, I can swim. What if you give me the
coin--

1394
01:12:24,756 --> 01:12:25,820
SAM: And then you can use it if you need it.

1395
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:28,231
LAURA: -- and if things get hairy, then I use it,
and then we drop Pass Without a Trace.

1396
01:12:28,231 --> 01:12:32,224
TALIESIN: If it's hairy, we won't need Pass
Without a Trace at all.

1397
01:12:32,224 --> 01:12:43,477
MARISHA: I can go ahead and cast Animal Shapes on
her, but it takes a turn, a round, for me to-- an

1398
01:12:43,477 --> 01:12:50,053
action to change her into something else, so can I
cast it on her, but leave her as Vex for now?

1399
01:12:50,053 --> 01:12:52,178
LAURA: I'm not gonna be an animal.

1400
01:12:52,178 --> 01:12:53,474
MARISHA: No, I know.

1401
01:12:53,474 --> 01:12:55,937
MATT: You assume the form of a different creature
for the duration.

1402
01:12:55,937 --> 01:12:58,054
A creature different from herself. Of the 
beast variety.

1403
01:12:58,054 --> 01:12:59,791
MARISHA: Okay. Never mind.

1404
01:12:59,791 --> 01:13:01,325
TALIESIN: We've got a plan.

1405
01:13:01,325 --> 01:13:02,620
LAURA: We're fine!

1406
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:04,492
MARISHA: 'Cause we need Pass Without a Trace for
her, right?

1407
01:13:04,492 --> 01:13:09,811
LAURA: Yeah, so I'll get a coin, I'll cast it, go
in, if things get bad, I'll use the coin.

1408
01:13:09,811 --> 01:13:11,431
MARISHA: You can cast the coin. Okay. All right.

1409
01:13:11,431 --> 01:13:12,032
SAM: You're a whale.

1410
01:13:12,032 --> 01:13:15,004
TALIESIN: I'm going to be a whale, we've got some
rope here, it's going to be your job once I'm a

1411
01:13:15,004 --> 01:13:19,988
whale to create at least a couple handholds with a
harness.

1412
01:13:19,988 --> 01:13:21,831
You know how to use knots, right, you can 
do some basic--

1413
01:13:21,831 --> 01:13:23,444
SAM: I know every knot in the book.

1414
01:13:23,444 --> 01:13:24,851
TALIESIN: I knew you would.

1415
01:13:24,851 --> 01:13:33,086
SAM: The double-sloop. The reverse-cowgirl. I know
'em all. I've got the itsy-bitsy spider.

1416
01:13:33,086 --> 01:13:34,757
TALIESIN: Keep going.

1417
01:13:34,757 --> 01:13:38,871
SAM: I know the rusty trombone. I've got--

1418
01:13:38,871 --> 01:13:41,041
LAURA: The old Alaskan pipeline.

1419
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:44,589
SAM: Yep. Got the figure eight, the figure four,
the hidden figures.

1420
01:13:44,589 --> 01:13:46,127
TALIESIN: The Dallas two-step.

1421
01:13:46,127 --> 01:13:49,285
SAM: I've got a bunch of 'em, yep.

1422
01:13:49,285 --> 01:13:51,101
TALIESIN: The sweet Caroline?

1423
01:13:51,101 --> 01:13:53,665
SAM: Oh, yes. That one. That one's good.

1424
01:13:53,665 --> 01:13:57,057
(all laugh)

1425
01:13:57,057 --> 01:14:04,242
TALIESIN: Good for tension. I'm also gonna grab--
I should not be allowed to drink this. I'm going

1426
01:14:04,242 --> 01:14:10,294
to take you aside really quickly and give you the
extra set of goggles and the bead.

1427
01:14:10,294 --> 01:14:11,578
LIAM: What do you want me to do with these? Just
keep them safe?

1428
01:14:11,578 --> 01:14:15,351
TALIESIN: Just in case. I'm-- you know how I get
with my hunches.

1429
01:14:15,351 --> 01:14:16,988
LIAM: Okay.

1430
01:14:16,988 --> 01:14:21,606
TALIESIN: You'll know, if we need them, we have
them. Just an extra set.

1431
01:14:21,606 --> 01:14:22,980
LIAM: All right, Freddie.

1432
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:24,459
MARISHA: Uvenda, these beads.

1433
01:14:24,459 --> 01:14:25,809
MATT: "Yes?"

1434
01:14:25,809 --> 01:14:30,757
MARISHA: Can you guys also track where we are
based on them?

1435
01:14:30,757 --> 01:14:31,980
MATT: "No, unfortunately."

1436
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:32,543
MARISHA: No.

1437
01:14:32,543 --> 01:14:34,798
MATT: "The magic is only localized."

1438
01:14:34,798 --> 01:14:35,838
MARISHA: All right.

1439
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:40,662
MATT: "We've recovered as many as we could from
previous scouts that have fallen."

1440
01:14:40,662 --> 01:14:48,385
MARISHA: I go ahead and I Druidcraft one of my
bark bracelets to put around her.

1441
01:14:48,385 --> 01:14:54,108
For scrying, if you need it.

1442
01:14:54,108 --> 01:14:58,929
MATT: "All right. Thank you."

1443
01:14:58,929 --> 01:15:05,955
SAM: Bigly man over there, do you want a coin in
case you lose your whale form?

1444
01:15:05,955 --> 01:15:07,613
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1445
01:15:07,613 --> 01:15:08,905
SAM: What about you, Percival?

1446
01:15:08,905 --> 01:15:10,261
TALIESIN: I'll take one just in case.

1447
01:15:10,261 --> 01:15:11,921
SAM: All right.

1448
01:15:11,921 --> 01:15:14,415
TRAVIS: What does it do?

1449
01:15:14,415 --> 01:15:23,969
SAM: You say, 'Alter Self!' and slam it against
your body and it'll make you with gills and stuff.

1450
01:15:23,969 --> 01:15:27,452
Does he speak-- he speaks Common, right? He
understands what I'm saying?

1451
01:15:27,452 --> 01:15:31,085
TALIESIN: Well.

1452
01:15:31,085 --> 01:15:34,568
TRAVIS: What does it do?

1453
01:15:34,568 --> 01:15:38,380
SAM: Make big, big hit, say 'Alter Self'--

1454
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:42,626
TRAVIS: What's the matter with you? Why are you
talking like that?

1455
01:15:42,626 --> 01:15:44,630
TALIESIN: That was everything I could've hoped
for.

1456
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:48,471
LIAM: He does speak Fucking-with-you. Very well.

1457
01:15:48,471 --> 01:15:52,649
SAM: All right, I guess I'll make four coins.

1458
01:15:52,649 --> 01:15:53,856
MATT: Okay.

1459
01:15:53,856 --> 01:15:59,472
SAM: And pass them out to Percy, Little Elf Boy,
Little Elf Girl, and Jumbo.

1460
01:15:59,472 --> 01:16:00,143
MATT: All right.

1461
01:16:00,143 --> 01:16:02,402
LIAM: Hi. My name is Vax.

1462
01:16:02,402 --> 01:16:02,806
SAM: Oh.

1463
01:16:02,806 --> 01:16:04,048
LIAM: That's short for Vax'ildan.

1464
01:16:04,048 --> 01:16:06,673
SAM: Have you heard the Legend of Taryon
Darrington?

1465
01:16:06,673 --> 01:16:09,334
LIAM: From you, yes, I have. It's a good tale.

1466
01:16:09,334 --> 01:16:11,117
SAM: Good, then, we're equals.

1467
01:16:11,117 --> 01:16:15,955
LIAM: That is my sister. Her name is Vex'ahlia.
You can call her Vex. Some people call her Vax.

1468
01:16:15,955 --> 01:16:18,474
LAURA: That's true.

1469
01:16:18,474 --> 01:16:19,854
SAM: That's very confusing.

1470
01:16:19,854 --> 01:16:21,666
LAURA: Yeah, you can call us by anything, we'll
both respond.

1471
01:16:21,666 --> 01:16:22,557
TALIESIN: At first, yes.

1472
01:16:22,557 --> 01:16:31,197
SAM: Okay. Okay. Were your parents fond of you,
because to name them that similar would be-- just

1473
01:16:31,197 --> 01:16:36,298
quite annoying, growing up, you must've gotten
confused constantly.

1474
01:16:36,298 --> 01:16:38,195
LIAM: I walk away.

1475
01:16:38,195 --> 01:16:39,651
(all laugh)

1476
01:16:39,651 --> 01:16:42,383
LAURA: I follow suit.

1477
01:16:42,383 --> 01:16:50,948
MATT: About this time, as you've seen Uvenda's
been looking out patiently, the water nearby at

1478
01:16:50,948 --> 01:16:55,677
the very edge of one of the reef drop-offs
splashes out, and you watch as a figure darts out

1479
01:16:55,677 --> 01:17:01,541
and lands and shakes off, and what you see there
looks to be a very, very dark-skinned, stocky

1480
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:11,310
dwarf, wearing the same goggles and throat bead
there. "Sorry about the delay." He wanders up and

1481
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:19,051
pulls his goggles off and rustles his hair a bit.
"Hello. So you're the ones traveling to the Aerie

1482
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:24,708
"today? Waverider Durent. Pleasure to meet you."
And he reaches over and grabs-- as he takes your

1483
01:17:24,708 --> 01:17:30,133
hand-- you put it out to extend it, he grasps it
and gives a firm shake.

1484
01:17:30,133 --> 01:17:37,452
You see he's got very, very short dirty-blonde 
hair--

1485
01:17:37,452 --> 01:17:39,201
MARISHA: Durent?

1486
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:40,610
SAM: Yeah.

1487
01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:46,037
MATT: And a beard that is just tattered and
knotted from not being kept or combed through.

1488
01:17:46,037 --> 01:17:47,880
MARISHA: So someone you would find at Venice
Beach.

1489
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:50,200
MATT: Kind of, yeah. He's the Venice Beach dwarf,
basically.

1490
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,171
LAURA: (gasps) That's awesome.

1491
01:17:51,171 --> 01:17:55,714
MATT: Straight-up, actually, now that you point it
out.

1492
01:17:55,714 --> 01:18:00,915
LIAM: Just finished going up the ropes and down.

1493
01:18:00,915 --> 01:18:05,217
MATT: "All right, I'm taking you down to the
Aerie. You ready?"

1494
01:18:05,217 --> 01:18:06,594
LAURA: I think so.

1495
01:18:06,594 --> 01:18:07,411
TALIESIN: Sure.

1496
01:18:07,411 --> 01:18:12,051
MARISHA: Are you gonna be with us the whole time,
or are you just getting us there?

1497
01:18:12,051 --> 01:18:13,459
MATT: "Well, I'm just getting you to the door."

1498
01:18:13,459 --> 01:18:14,492
MARISHA: Of course.

1499
01:18:14,492 --> 01:18:16,114
SAM: Wait, there's a door?

1500
01:18:16,114 --> 01:18:18,119
TALIESIN: Oh, now we're really in trouble.

1501
01:18:18,119 --> 01:18:20,206
LAURA: This is where we're gonna check out the
lodestones, before we go through the door.

1502
01:18:20,206 --> 01:18:22,615
TRAVIS: Right, yeah. Knew it. Making sure you
knew.

1503
01:18:22,615 --> 01:18:25,718
MARISHA: There's doors to the other planes. That's
our people's job.

1504
01:18:25,718 --> 01:18:26,852
MATT: "It's a figure of speech."

1505
01:18:26,852 --> 01:18:28,468
SAM: We're going to another plane?

1506
01:18:28,468 --> 01:18:30,033
ALL: Yes.

1507
01:18:30,033 --> 01:18:33,705
SAM: Oh my. Okay. This is great. This is great.

1508
01:18:33,705 --> 01:18:34,747
MATT: "Oh, you look really excited."

1509
01:18:34,747 --> 01:18:35,380
SAM: I am.

1510
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:40,415
MATT: "You shouldn't be. Now, come on. See you've
got your equipment." And takes his goggles and

1511
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:46,215
puts them back on. They're bulbous, they're just
these giant domes that make you look fly-like.

1512
01:18:46,215 --> 01:18:47,317
TALIESIN: I love it.

1513
01:18:47,317 --> 01:18:48,277
LIAM: Nice.

1514
01:18:48,277 --> 01:18:53,552
MATT: "Okay. Now. Follow suit." He looks over.
"Thank you, Uvenda."

1515
01:18:53,552 --> 01:18:57,203
"Of course. Take care of them."

1516
01:18:57,203 --> 01:19:04,030
"That's not my job." And dives into the
water.

1517
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:05,363
MARISHA: I go in first.

1518
01:19:05,363 --> 01:19:06,824
SAM: Wait, don't you have to make some of us--

1519
01:19:06,824 --> 01:19:08,925
MARISHA: Oh, right.

1520
01:19:08,925 --> 01:19:10,707
LAURA: No, no, no, wait, how long does it last?

1521
01:19:10,707 --> 01:19:12,554
TRAVIS: Right at the fucking start.

1522
01:19:12,554 --> 01:19:13,467
MARISHA: Are we doing this now?

1523
01:19:13,467 --> 01:19:15,200
LAURA: No, 'cause we can do it underwater, can't
we?

1524
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,577
MARISHA: Animal Shapes last for 24 hours.

1525
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:21,080
LAURA: Well, let's wait until we're going into the
water plane before we turn into fucking whales.

1526
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:24,601
TRAVIS: Don't we have to examine shit first? With
our non-flipper hands?

1527
01:19:24,601 --> 01:19:32,572
MARISHA: Yeah, he's gonna be showing us the stones
first, right? So yeah. Jesus. I go in first.

1528
01:19:32,572 --> 01:19:36,620
MATT: All right. So you guys follow suit, diving
in, diving in, each one of you in the order you

1529
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:42,643
wish, eventually with Doty (splash) just sinking
very heavily down after you.

1530
01:19:42,643 --> 01:19:43,498
LAURA: He's coming?

1531
01:19:43,498 --> 01:19:44,538
SAM: Oh, no.

1532
01:19:44,538 --> 01:19:46,676
LAURA: Tary, shouldn't we leave him?

1533
01:19:46,676 --> 01:19:47,989
SAM: How deep is this?

1534
01:19:47,989 --> 01:19:50,439
MARISHA: I can't-- nope, he's a construct.

1535
01:19:50,439 --> 01:19:51,555
MATT: Do you prefer Doty not to?

1536
01:19:51,555 --> 01:19:53,914
SAM: I would prefer Doty not come. He can't swim,
right?

1537
01:19:53,914 --> 01:19:55,341
MATT: No, he can just walk across the bottom.

1538
01:19:55,341 --> 01:20:00,792
TRAVIS: We're not going to tell you what to do
here.

1539
01:20:00,792 --> 01:20:01,949
MATT: Your call.

1540
01:20:01,949 --> 01:20:04,990
SAM: I'm a little confused. We're going underwater
now,

1541
01:20:04,990 --> 01:20:07,017
but not to where we're going for the mission?

1542
01:20:07,017 --> 01:20:07,702
MATT: Correct.

1543
01:20:07,702 --> 01:20:13,942
MARISHA: The portal to the other dimension is
underwater and through a rift.

1544
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:15,542
TRAVIS: Imagine endless water.

1545
01:20:15,542 --> 01:20:17,464
LAURA: Just lots of water.

1546
01:20:17,464 --> 01:20:18,755
TRAVIS: No possible-- bottomless.

1547
01:20:18,755 --> 01:20:21,188
SAM: All right, then Doty can come this far.

1548
01:20:21,188 --> 01:20:23,605
LIAM: To the rift?

1549
01:20:23,605 --> 01:20:25,318
SAM: Just to the door.

1550
01:20:25,318 --> 01:20:26,794
TRAVIS: We barely knew him. Bring him along.

1551
01:20:26,794 --> 01:20:28,306
LIAM: Wait by the gate. Like a butler.

1552
01:20:28,306 --> 01:20:29,814
SAM: Yes.

1553
01:20:29,814 --> 01:20:30,857
TRAVIS: That was quick.

1554
01:20:30,857 --> 01:20:34,337
LAURA: What if he gets rusty?

1555
01:20:34,337 --> 01:20:35,753
SAM: I hadn't thought of that.

1556
01:20:35,753 --> 01:20:37,772
LAURA: It might be smart to not have him join us.

1557
01:20:37,772 --> 01:20:39,588
TALIESIN: The rusty Doty's another knot that you
know.

1558
01:20:39,588 --> 01:20:40,754
LAURA: Just leave him behind.

1559
01:20:40,754 --> 01:20:41,637
SAM: The rusty Doty?

1560
01:20:41,637 --> 01:20:45,301
(all laugh)

1561
01:20:45,301 --> 01:20:47,248
MATT: What's your plan? Yes or no?

1562
01:20:47,248 --> 01:20:49,398
SAM: Doty, you should stay behind.

1563
01:20:49,398 --> 01:20:52,523
MATT: Goes to jump, like--

1564
01:20:52,523 --> 01:21:00,980
SAM: Stay behind, and just take atmospheric notes,
you know. Time of day, position of sun. Type of

1565
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:12,907
clouds. And if anyone tries to steal my stuff,
describe them very well in the book.

1566
01:21:12,907 --> 01:21:15,625
MATT: A little seagull flies overhead.

1567
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:19,471
(all laugh)

1568
01:21:19,471 --> 01:21:22,827
SAM: It's all for color, for the book, you know.

1569
01:21:22,827 --> 01:21:28,245
MATT: Another one. Just taking very, very good
notes.

1570
01:21:28,245 --> 01:21:32,667
SAM: Two chapters of seagull flight patterns.

1571
01:21:32,667 --> 01:21:38,861
MARISHA: You're gonna have an excellent book on
the mating habits of seagulls when you get back.

1572
01:21:38,861 --> 01:21:41,354
MATT: Eat your heart out, Darwin. Doty's on the
case.

1573
01:21:41,354 --> 01:21:42,163
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

1574
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:44,225
LIAM: Love you, Matt.

1575
01:21:44,225 --> 01:21:49,475
MATT: It's ridiculous. So you guys all eventually
dive into the water, and as you do, you look down

1576
01:21:49,475 --> 01:21:59,195
and there is essentially a 40-foot-wide gap in the
beach here, just barely submerged beach, that

1577
01:21:59,195 --> 01:22:05,323
coasts down and drops off directly down into this
cylindrical section that is just open. And as you

1578
01:22:05,323 --> 01:22:11,605
drift down, your goggles visible, you can see
around you, dry, pale reef that slowly gives way

1579
01:22:11,605 --> 01:22:18,788
to colorful, life-teeming reef. You see hundreds
of fish of different sizes and colors, all darting

1580
01:22:18,788 --> 01:22:23,385
in and out of the various gaps and openings in the
side, you see vibrant plant life beginning to

1581
01:22:23,385 --> 01:22:30,879
massively jut out from the side of this reef.
Further down, you see eels twisting through, and

1582
01:22:30,879 --> 01:22:37,595
bits of kelp and other long, underwater plant life
tickle your body as you push past and drift,

1583
01:22:37,595 --> 01:22:43,461
keeping track of where you're slowly sinking down,
desperately trying to follow this dwarf that is no

1584
01:22:43,461 --> 01:22:47,262
longer in view, he just dove straight down and is
far more comfortable under the water than most of

1585
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:54,125
you. Eventually, the reef begins to cluster in
tighter and tighter, and you start getting a

1586
01:22:54,125 --> 01:22:58,510
little nervous as to if you're going to hit a
bottom or hit a pinch point. And then suddenly it

1587
01:22:58,510 --> 01:23:05,821
stops, the reef just ends, and you now are
floating down into what appears to be endless dark

1588
01:23:05,821 --> 01:23:12,206
ocean. And just below, you see just a faint bit of
light, and you start noticing the dark color is

1589
01:23:12,206 --> 01:23:18,208
because you're about to hit an extremely dense
forest of underwater plant life. You watch as all

1590
01:23:18,208 --> 01:23:26,170
of these long, thin tendrils of almost vines
covered in elongated leaves begin to curl up

1591
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:29,821
around you, and you start pushing through,
following this light, and as you get across to the

1592
01:23:29,821 --> 01:23:34,332
edge, Keyleth, you're the closest ahead and you
guys have just enough light to watch the bead of

1593
01:23:34,332 --> 01:23:40,608
where Keyleth is. Keyleth, you can still see
Durent and keep that pace. He leads you down over

1594
01:23:40,703 --> 01:23:48,194
this bank of where the top of this underwater
forest ends, and you see, attached to the reef

1595
01:23:48,194 --> 01:23:55,886
above by a single pillar of stonework that seems
to be built or carved out of the reef, emerges a

1596
01:23:55,886 --> 01:24:03,800
spiraling tower that eventually ends on the floor
of the ocean here. It's made of a yellowish-white

1597
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:10,766
sandstone-like color, there are pillars carved out
of it, naturalistic, but also have almost a series

1598
01:24:10,766 --> 01:24:16,329
of bevelled edges to them. Within the inside,
there is a dull green glow that is pulsating, and

1599
01:24:16,329 --> 01:24:21,409
as Durent makes his way down toward one of the
many openings in the floors, you can see there is

1600
01:24:21,409 --> 01:24:29,906
a very, very faint sparkling energy that seems to
just drift up out of the center of this tower. As

1601
01:24:29,906 --> 01:24:34,510
you make it further down towards the base, you now
begin to see through some of the openings, the

1602
01:24:34,510 --> 01:24:41,948
center of this tower is hollow. It is an exterior,
like a very thin Colosseum-like structure that

1603
01:24:41,948 --> 01:24:47,612
goes up for multiple floors, slowly pincering as
it gets to the top, and it is just an open

1604
01:24:47,612 --> 01:24:54,004
interior inside. As eventually you touch down onto
the soft bottom of the ocean here and begin making

1605
01:24:54,004 --> 01:24:59,738
your way, slowly swimming towards the interior,
you can see a number of other similarly dressed

1606
01:24:59,738 --> 01:25:05,516
Waveriders as well as armored guardians that
stand, all with various trident or spear-like

1607
01:25:05,516 --> 01:25:12,812
weapons. A number of them appear to be of varying
races, human, half-elf, elf, it appears that

1608
01:25:12,909 --> 01:25:17,087
Durent is the only dwarf you see in this vicinity,
and a couple of them appear to be merfolk, like

1609
01:25:17,087 --> 01:25:23,521
straight-up half-human, half-fish, tails, fins,
gills, the whole circumstance.

1610
01:25:23,521 --> 01:25:25,256
LAURA: What does their hair look like?

1611
01:25:25,256 --> 01:25:30,843
MATT: (laughs) You see two of them, one of which
is male. No visible hair on him, actually, just

1612
01:25:30,843 --> 01:25:38,487
the frill that goes down his head. The other is
female. Long, deep, dark blue hair that drifts

1613
01:25:38,487 --> 01:25:40,986
past, and as she shifts and looks in your
direction,

1614
01:25:40,986 --> 01:25:46,117
you watch it hold in place and slowly
shift as the water currents push through.

1615
01:25:46,117 --> 01:25:48,473
LAURA: I just stare at her.

1616
01:25:48,473 --> 01:25:54,832
MATT: (laughs) As you're entranced by this, your
attention slowly glides over to the very center,

1617
01:25:54,832 --> 01:26:03,566
the base of this temple, where you can see there
are these three large, smooth, gray-ish rocks that

1618
01:26:03,566 --> 01:26:09,248
are embedded in the ground, about five feet wide,
and in the center of these three rocks, you see

1619
01:26:09,248 --> 01:26:16,889
what appears to be-- it's almost like an oval
shape, about ten feet tall, about five feet wide,

1620
01:26:16,889 --> 01:26:27,340
that is crackling blue energy. This opening, here.
And you can watch as occasionally clouds of black,

1621
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:35,943
murky soot or sand, deep, deep ocean sand, push
through. You can see, as you get closer and peer

1622
01:26:35,943 --> 01:26:44,020
in, this is a doorway into the plane, this is the
rift. Unlike the one that you saw at Pyrah, which

1623
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:50,250
seemed to flicker and have a barely contained
energy when you've seen it at its torn-open

1624
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:54,993
stages, this appears to be fairly contained. It's
demure, there's not a lot of movement, it's just

1625
01:26:54,993 --> 01:26:59,738
stationary, and the guards that surround it in the
center of this temple all look inward, keeping

1626
01:26:59,738 --> 01:27:06,480
vigilant watch. As you follow Durent, making his
way towards the doorway, you can see within each

1627
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:17,260
of these three large, half-buried stones, there is
a smaller, deep emerald green, almost jade-looking

1628
01:27:17,260 --> 01:27:23,803
stone that is about that large that is embedded in each
of these. Durent points over to one of them, and

1629
01:27:23,913 --> 01:27:31,247
you hear him, through the water, the throat bead
carrying the sound of his voice through, "This is

1630
01:27:31,247 --> 01:27:39,105
"what you're looking for. This is a lodestone. Take
your time, as much as you need, to study it. Find

1631
01:27:39,196 --> 01:27:42,937
"what you need. Let me know when you're ready to
pass through."

1632
01:27:42,937 --> 01:27:45,966
LAURA: Are they all the same color? Every
lodestone looks the same?

1633
01:27:45,966 --> 01:27:49,769
MATT: Yeah, you glance through, they're all the
same color. Slight variations, and the shapes

1634
01:27:49,769 --> 01:27:53,116
change a little bit, some are perfectly spherical,
some are a little oblong,

1635
01:27:53,116 --> 01:27:55,342
just whatever shape it eventually hardened into.

1636
01:27:55,342 --> 01:27:57,057
TALIESIN: Kind of a natural jade?

1637
01:27:57,057 --> 01:28:03,292
MATT: Kind of, yeah. But like a dark, dark jade.
Like Maori, New Zealand jade.

1638
01:28:03,292 --> 01:28:05,004
LAURA: Not translucent at all, not--

1639
01:28:05,004 --> 01:28:05,864
MATT: No.

1640
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:07,175
LAURA: Okay.

1641
01:28:07,175 --> 01:28:12,142
MARISHA: Keyleth goes up and touches one and
meditates on it for a second.

1642
01:28:12,142 --> 01:28:18,026
MATT: Okay. As you put your hand towards it, you
feel a very, very faint vibration,

1643
01:28:18,026 --> 01:28:21,592
actually a very similar vibration to the throat 
bead.

1644
01:28:21,592 --> 01:28:25,917
MARISHA: Really. Are the throat beads green? Do
they look similar?

1645
01:28:25,917 --> 01:28:29,798
MATT: At this point, now? You notice, yes, they're
made of the same material. You see that a lot of--

1646
01:28:29,798 --> 01:28:34,433
the lodestones' main purpose is here, but a lot of
the inherent magic of them, or at least the

1647
01:28:34,433 --> 01:28:40,894
enchantment properties of it, it's a pretty big
part of the general life here at Vesrah.

1648
01:28:40,894 --> 01:28:46,231
MARISHA: Do the beads tend to react when they get
closer to the lodestone?

1649
01:28:46,231 --> 01:28:49,153
MATT: There is no change. But you do feel that
faint hum

1650
01:28:49,153 --> 01:28:53,287
and vibration of power of the lodestone
that is embedded within.

1651
01:28:53,287 --> 01:28:58,156
MARISHA: I turn to Durent. Whereabouts do they
tend to be found? The lodestones?

1652
01:28:58,156 --> 01:29:00,529
MATT: "Well, I mean, all over."

1653
01:29:00,529 --> 01:29:01,861
MARISHA: All over?

1654
01:29:01,861 --> 01:29:04,952
MATT: "Who knows where they've been dropped. The
ocean tends to swallow things up.

1655
01:29:04,952 --> 01:29:08,063
"You might have to dig. Mostly we find them 
buried."

1656
01:29:08,063 --> 01:29:10,244
MARISHA: Buried.

1657
01:29:10,244 --> 01:29:12,690
TALIESIN: How heavy are they?

1658
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:20,241
MATT: "Let me show you." And he goes over and grabs
one and (strains) and pulls it out. The doorway

1659
01:29:20,334 --> 01:29:25,614
flickers ever so slightly. He's like, "It's fine
for a moment." And hands it to you. You take it,

1660
01:29:25,614 --> 01:29:30,428
and for its size, it is surprisingly dense. It has
about twice the weight you were expecting, and

1661
01:29:30,428 --> 01:29:35,351
your arms just (grunts) a little bit. Also, as
you're holding it, you notice the clasp on your

1662
01:29:35,351 --> 01:29:41,082
cloak is being pulled towards it. As you pull it
away, and pull towards it,

1663
01:29:41,082 --> 01:29:43,603
you realize these are actually fairly magnetic.

1664
01:29:43,603 --> 01:29:44,549
TALIESIN: They're magnetic?

1665
01:29:44,549 --> 01:29:45,285
MATT: Yes.

1666
01:29:45,285 --> 01:29:47,704
MARISHA: Magnetic. Percy, do you have a compass?

1667
01:29:47,704 --> 01:29:52,644
TALIESIN: I don't, but I can fake one pretty
quickly if we have to.

1668
01:29:52,644 --> 01:29:55,782
MARISHA: Really? You don't have a compass.
Really?

1669
01:29:55,782 --> 01:29:57,202
TALIESIN: We never needed a compass.

1670
01:29:57,202 --> 01:29:59,654
TRAVIS: What do we even have you here for, I
mean?

1671
01:29:59,654 --> 01:30:03,552
TALIESIN: Is it possible-- well, we're too deep
now, but--

1672
01:30:03,552 --> 01:30:07,806
MATT: As you're having this conversation, you
watch as Durent's patiently there.

1673
01:30:07,806 --> 01:30:10,012
TALIESIN: You have a compass, don't you? And I'm
going to hand it back to him.

1674
01:30:10,012 --> 01:30:18,808
MATT: "No, but I need the stone." Puts it back
inside. "Okay, we're good."

1675
01:30:18,808 --> 01:30:24,613
SAM: If I examine it, do I detect any magic on
it?

1676
01:30:24,613 --> 01:30:29,984
MATT: You do. Profoundly magical, this is a very,
very strong natural magic source.

1677
01:30:29,984 --> 01:30:33,493
TALIESIN: This is going to be weird. I'm going to
take out a chunk of Whitestone residuum and just

1678
01:30:33,493 --> 01:30:38,963
compare the color and see if there's any
relation.

1679
01:30:38,963 --> 01:30:44,232
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

1680
01:30:44,232 --> 01:30:46,800
TALIESIN: Look at my sheet. That's a natural 20.

1681
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,857
(all cheer)

1682
01:30:48,857 --> 01:30:52,332
TRAVIS: The snitch returns.

1683
01:30:52,332 --> 01:30:57,886
MATT: Interestingly enough, there are
similarities. It is not the same material, but

1684
01:30:57,886 --> 01:31:02,921
you've had enough time to study whitestone, and
get a feel that there are-- this is your first

1685
01:31:02,921 --> 01:31:13,936
inclination that there are more than one substance
that seems to be related to the nature of magic.

1686
01:31:13,936 --> 01:31:18,004
This is-- at least based on the ecology and what
little bit of history you've picked up from the

1687
01:31:18,004 --> 01:31:22,152
kraken and how long it's been around-- whitestone
may be one of

1688
01:31:22,152 --> 01:31:27,140
the more recent sources of this type
of power, or variation on this type of power.

1689
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:36,551
But there are certain comparable facets of 
its ability, yeah.

1690
01:31:36,551 --> 01:31:40,184
TALIESIN: It actually occurs to me that I might
have some magnets on my person. Can I make an

1691
01:31:40,184 --> 01:31:44,482
investigation check? I had quietly in my head been
using them to

1692
01:31:44,482 --> 01:31:48,708
keep my coat down when I was running
around with the spider boots.

1693
01:31:48,708 --> 01:31:50,885
LIAM: The magic of improv.

1694
01:31:50,885 --> 01:31:52,633
TALIESIN: I wouldn't say it if it wasn't true.

1695
01:31:52,633 --> 01:31:53,399
MATT: No, that's fine.

1696
01:31:53,399 --> 01:31:55,165
TALIESIN: Can I make a roll to see if I happen to
have some on me?

1697
01:31:55,165 --> 01:32:00,025
MATT: I'd say you have them on you. You're Percy.
It's fine. They're very simple magnets.

1698
01:32:00,025 --> 01:32:02,997
TALIESIN: Yeah. They might help with-- I'm going
to try and see

1699
01:32:02,997 --> 01:32:10,752
if I can use them as a very base
dowsing rod for these stones.

1700
01:32:10,752 --> 01:32:14,794
MATT: You notice that you don't-- any sort of pull
you feel on the magnet

1701
01:32:14,794 --> 01:32:18,264
doesn't seem to hit until
you're within about a foot or so of the stone.

1702
01:32:18,264 --> 01:32:19,077
TALIESIN: Okay.

1703
01:32:19,077 --> 01:32:22,421
LAURA: I do have Locate Object.

1704
01:32:22,421 --> 01:32:28,465
SAM: I pull out my compass and see if it works.

1705
01:32:28,465 --> 01:32:29,900
MATT: Okay, you pull out your compass?

1706
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:30,825
TRAVIS: You have a compass?

1707
01:32:30,825 --> 01:32:34,745
SAM: Sure. Yeah, I have a compass, by the way.

1708
01:32:34,745 --> 01:32:36,718
MARISHA: Really, you have a compass?

1709
01:32:36,718 --> 01:32:42,650
MATT: As you pull it out, you watch, as you stand
there, it's confused, it's darting around and

1710
01:32:42,650 --> 01:32:45,263
doing circles. As you begin to step in one
direction towards one of the stones,

1711
01:32:45,263 --> 01:32:47,248
it rights itself in its direction.

1712
01:32:47,248 --> 01:32:50,045
SAM: Hm. Fascinating.

1713
01:32:50,045 --> 01:32:50,927
LAURA: Nice.

1714
01:32:50,927 --> 01:32:53,012
MARISHA: Will you keep that handy, you know?

1715
01:32:53,012 --> 01:32:59,433
SAM: Oh, sorry. Yes. One second. Just, still
pressurizing.

1716
01:32:59,433 --> 01:33:00,655
MARISHA: Sure.

1717
01:33:00,655 --> 01:33:02,252
TRAVIS: Equalizing.

1718
01:33:02,252 --> 01:33:06,602
TALIESIN: In my head, you have zinc all over your
nose. There's just zinc.

1719
01:33:06,602 --> 01:33:07,857
MARISHA: And a hula shirt.

1720
01:33:07,857 --> 01:33:09,286
SAM: Oh yes, do you want a--

1721
01:33:09,286 --> 01:33:14,317
TALIESIN: Yes, we're really pale people, this is
probably a good idea. No.

1722
01:33:14,317 --> 01:33:17,139
MARISHA: I tap it, because I've seen other people
do that,

1723
01:33:17,139 --> 01:33:19,020
and I feel like that's what you do with compasses.

1724
01:33:19,132 --> 01:33:20,536
TRAVIS: And it shatters.

1725
01:33:20,536 --> 01:33:21,739
MATT: (shattering sound)

1726
01:33:21,739 --> 01:33:23,334
MARISHA: Ahh!

1727
01:33:23,334 --> 01:33:26,910
MATT: Yeah, it seems to be a functional compass.

1728
01:33:26,910 --> 01:33:32,299
MARISHA: Do you want to be the compass man? Are
you gonna man the compass? Be navigation?

1729
01:33:32,299 --> 01:33:33,783
SAM: The leader? Absolutely.

1730
01:33:33,783 --> 01:33:34,746
TALIESIN: The navigator, yes.

1731
01:33:34,746 --> 01:33:36,224
SAM: The navigator. Sure.

1732
01:33:36,224 --> 01:33:37,026
MARISHA: The navigator.

1733
01:33:37,026 --> 01:33:40,065
SAM: Sure.

1734
01:33:40,065 --> 01:33:42,812
MATT: All right.

1735
01:33:42,812 --> 01:33:50,225
TRAVIS: Any other tests you brainy types want to
do on these giant, green balls?

1736
01:33:50,225 --> 01:33:53,419
TALIESIN: I feel comfortable. We have Locate
Object, we have a compass.

1737
01:33:53,464 --> 01:33:58,073
LAURA: Yes. Locate Object is concentration, and so
is Pass Without a Trace.

1738
01:33:58,073 --> 01:34:04,531
MARISHA: So when we get through the void, and
maybe we can do a Locate Object and then Pass

1739
01:34:04,531 --> 01:34:09,473
Without a Trace, and then I'll cast Animal Shapes,
and then we go.

1740
01:34:09,473 --> 01:34:10,529
MATT: Locate Object, by the way--

1741
01:34:10,529 --> 01:34:11,776
LIAM: That is a lot of steps.

1742
01:34:11,776 --> 01:34:12,818
LAURA: It's within 1000 feet.

1743
01:34:12,818 --> 01:34:13,371
MATT: Yes.

1744
01:34:13,371 --> 01:34:14,715
LAURA: Yes.

1745
01:34:14,715 --> 01:34:15,776
MARISHA: But it lasts for ten minutes.

1746
01:34:15,776 --> 01:34:16,510
MATT: It does, yes.

1747
01:34:16,510 --> 01:34:17,528
LAURA: Yes.

1748
01:34:17,528 --> 01:34:20,130
MATT: Okay. So. You guys ready?

1749
01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:20,774
MARISHA: Yeah.

1750
01:34:20,774 --> 01:34:21,640
SAM: Yes.

1751
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:22,303
LIAM: Eh.

1752
01:34:22,303 --> 01:34:23,333
MATT: All right--

1753
01:34:23,333 --> 01:34:24,217
TRAVIS: Are we ready?

1754
01:34:24,217 --> 01:34:25,110
LAURA: Are we ready?

1755
01:34:25,110 --> 01:34:32,896
MATT: Durent looks at your faces as you're all
staring and goes, "Okay. So. About time?"

1756
01:34:32,896 --> 01:34:34,429
LAURA: Have you seen a kraken?

1757
01:34:34,429 --> 01:34:35,589
MATT: "Oh yeah, I've seen it."

1758
01:34:35,589 --> 01:34:36,507
LAURA: And?

1759
01:34:36,507 --> 01:34:38,127
MATT: "Oh, it's fucking terrible."

1760
01:34:38,127 --> 01:34:40,171
LAURA: How big, are we talking?

1761
01:34:40,171 --> 01:34:46,138
TRAVIS: Immense?

1762
01:34:46,138 --> 01:34:49,650
MATT: "You know this, this size? It's a lot
bigger."

1763
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:51,023
LIAM: How many Grogs?

1764
01:34:51,023 --> 01:34:52,094
LAURA: Big enough to swallow him?

1765
01:34:52,094 --> 01:34:52,996
MATT: "Oh, yeah."

1766
01:34:52,996 --> 01:34:57,139
LIAM: Like ten Grogs long?

1767
01:34:57,139 --> 01:34:58,312
MATT: "Hundred."

1768
01:34:58,312 --> 01:34:59,286
LIAM: Hundred Grogs long?!

1769
01:34:59,286 --> 01:35:07,851
MATT: "It's hard, it's spatial awareness. Look,
I'm not a science man like these two, but it's big."

1770
01:35:07,851 --> 01:35:08,721
TALIESIN: I'm a science man!

1771
01:35:08,721 --> 01:35:09,935
TRAVIS: Your beard is glorious.

1772
01:35:09,935 --> 01:35:13,511
MATT: "Thank you. Yours isn't too bad yourself,
boy!" He tousles it up.

1773
01:35:13,511 --> 01:35:21,700
TRAVIS: Yeah, hold on. Are there any barnacles
down here I can put in that? Is it fast in the water?

1774
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:24,575
MATT: "I'd say it's pretty fast, aye."

1775
01:35:24,575 --> 01:35:28,540
LIAM: And you've seen it leave these stones, these
lodes?

1776
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:33,495
MATT: "I've seen him through the door. Oh, I don't
go in there!"

1777
01:35:33,495 --> 01:35:34,828
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah?

1778
01:35:34,828 --> 01:35:37,321
MATT: "No, I just watch the doorway. That's my
job"

1779
01:35:37,321 --> 01:35:40,982
SAM: You don't watch him drop his lodes.

1780
01:35:40,982 --> 01:35:45,662
MATT: "I have not yet seen the kraken drop its
lodes, no."

1781
01:35:45,662 --> 01:35:46,702
LAURA: All right.

1782
01:35:46,702 --> 01:35:52,012
LIAM: I have never felt more prepared than I do
right now. Let's do this shit.

1783
01:35:52,012 --> 01:35:52,914
LAURA: Let's.

1784
01:35:52,914 --> 01:35:55,356
MATT: "If it goes bad, come back."

1785
01:35:55,356 --> 01:35:56,054
LAURA: Run.

1786
01:35:56,054 --> 01:35:57,554
MATT: "Just get back."

1787
01:35:57,554 --> 01:35:59,057
LAURA: Right.

1788
01:35:59,057 --> 01:36:01,221
MATT: "You'll fail, but you'll get back."

1789
01:36:01,221 --> 01:36:06,864
MARISHA: I'll fail?! Did you just say I'll fail?
Okay, bye!

1790
01:36:06,864 --> 01:36:16,086
MATT: As you guys, one by one, plunge through the
rift in the Aerie of Torrent, into the water

1791
01:36:16,086 --> 01:36:23,277
elemental plane. And that's where we'll take a
break. We'll be back here in just a few moments

1792
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:26,547
guys. Real fast, we do have a giveaway from our
friends at Wyrmwood.

1793
01:36:26,547 --> 01:36:27,849
TRAVIS: Giveaway!

1794
01:36:27,849 --> 01:36:36,054
MATT: We have a Hero Vault made of very aromatic
cedar. That actually smells of the most glorious hamster

1795
01:36:36,054 --> 01:36:42,625
cage ever, it's awesome. Aww, I love that smell.
It reminds me of when I had my first pet.

1796
01:36:42,716 --> 01:36:44,703
LIAM: It smells like poop?

1797
01:36:44,703 --> 01:36:48,646
MATT: So, this will be going out to somebody. Just
to clarify, if you want to be part of this, you

1798
01:36:48,646 --> 01:36:51,740
need to come into the Twitch chat. So, come into
the Twitch chat.

1799
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:54,894
Our code word tonight is, guess what, 
'kraken.'

1800
01:36:54,894 --> 01:36:55,880
LAURA: Kraken!

1801
01:36:55,880 --> 01:37:00,276
MATT: So, as soon as that opens up in the chat,
make sure you write kraken in the chat to be

1802
01:37:00,276 --> 01:37:06,671
entered into the contest, and we'll come back with
a winner of this awesome Hero Vault in just a bit.

1803
01:37:06,671 --> 01:57:55,369
[break]

1804
01:57:55,461 --> 01:57:57,107
MATT: Hello, and welcome back everyone!

1805
01:57:57,107 --> 01:57:58,299
LIAM: (shouting, away from mic) What, we're on,
now?

1806
01:57:58,299 --> 01:57:59,076
MARISHA: Jesus.

1807
01:57:59,076 --> 01:58:00,146
MATT: Yeah, it was quick, imagine that.

1808
01:58:00,146 --> 01:58:00,990
LIAM: Holy cow.

1809
01:58:00,990 --> 01:58:02,016
MARISHA: Hi, countdown.

1810
01:58:02,016 --> 01:58:05,851
SAM: Wait a second! Okay. Nothing. But they can't
see the map, yet, can they?

1811
01:58:05,851 --> 01:58:06,950
MATT: They will shortly.

1812
01:58:06,950 --> 01:58:07,452
MARISHA: The map?

1813
01:58:07,452 --> 01:58:08,870
TALIESIN: They can't see the map yet.

1814
01:58:08,870 --> 01:58:09,774
MATT: So, as you guys emerge--

1815
01:58:09,774 --> 01:58:11,703
(all gasp)

1816
01:58:11,703 --> 01:58:12,730
MATT: Oh! (laughs)

1817
01:58:12,730 --> 01:58:14,141
LAURA: Is it beautiful?

1818
01:58:14,141 --> 01:58:15,527
MARISHA: Yes I just noticed it, yeah.

1819
01:58:15,527 --> 01:58:16,546
LIAM: You just opened your eyes?

1820
01:58:16,546 --> 01:58:18,378
LAURA: Aw, it's so cool!

1821
01:58:18,378 --> 01:58:24,062
MATT: So, this here is the exterior portal, into
the floor. You step out at about two feet below

1822
01:58:24,062 --> 01:58:30,250
the doorway, your feet (two dull thuds) slowly hit
the soft, cushy bottom of the water elemental

1823
01:58:30,250 --> 01:58:36,141
plane. You see about you a number of thick
clusters of various underwater plant life, rising

1824
01:58:36,141 --> 01:58:41,996
up and slowly shifting with the waves and the
water. You also see throughout the dark sand in

1825
01:58:41,996 --> 01:58:53,081
the vicinity hundreds of bones and various other
chunks of flesh, in various long states of decay.

1826
01:58:53,081 --> 01:59:00,906
It is dark down here, you maybe have about 20 to
30 feet of visual range right here unaided. Our

1827
01:59:00,906 --> 01:59:06,693
two humans friends over there have almost no sight
beyond a five, ten-foot distance here. Usually,

1828
01:59:06,693 --> 01:59:13,531
from just the glow of your armor, your helm itself
has this radiant glow about it.

1829
01:59:13,531 --> 01:59:18,804
LIAM: I'm using Divine Sense right now to see if
anything is not completely--

1830
01:59:18,804 --> 01:59:20,854
MATT: Okay, you're-- you're divining for what?

1831
01:59:20,854 --> 01:59:23,226
LIAM: Undead. In the bones.

1832
01:59:23,226 --> 01:59:24,325
MARISHA: Ooh.

1833
01:59:24,325 --> 01:59:29,416
MATT: Okay, as you carefully close your eyes and
focus, you lend your essence out to the Raven

1834
01:59:29,416 --> 01:59:33,066
Queen even across the planes to guide your vision
to anything of undeath,

1835
01:59:33,066 --> 01:59:39,021
or fiendish in nature. And nothing.

1836
01:59:39,021 --> 01:59:43,788
LAURA: I'm going to take a moment to use Primal
Awareness and see--

1837
01:59:43,788 --> 01:59:45,855
is there a way to sense krakens? Or anything.

1838
01:59:45,855 --> 01:59:48,090
MATT: I don't know, do you know how to sense
krakens?

1839
01:59:48,090 --> 01:59:49,877
LAURA: I don't know, do I?

1840
01:59:49,877 --> 01:59:51,437
TRAVIS: Do you sense calamari?

1841
01:59:51,437 --> 01:59:54,408
LIAM: DM snark!

1842
01:59:54,408 --> 01:59:57,054
MATT: Looking at your various choices.

1843
01:59:57,054 --> 02:00:00,434
LAURA: Aberrations, celestials, dragons,
elementals, fey, fiends and undead.

1844
02:00:00,434 --> 02:00:01,446
LIAM: And krakens, it says right there--

1845
02:00:01,446 --> 02:00:02,305
LAURA: And krakens.

1846
02:00:02,305 --> 02:00:03,222
MATT: Okay, as--

1847
02:00:03,222 --> 02:00:04,017
LAURA: Krakens--

1848
02:00:04,017 --> 02:00:07,749
MATT: As you focus your attention, utilizing-- and
mark off your ability there.

1849
02:00:07,749 --> 02:00:08,494
LAURA: Yes.

1850
02:00:08,494 --> 02:00:13,695
MATT: You sense nothing. You said elementals are
on there?

1851
02:00:13,695 --> 02:00:15,248
LAURA: Elementals, aberrations--

1852
02:00:15,248 --> 02:00:16,250
LIAM: Aberrations.

1853
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:17,252
LAURA: -- and fiends.

1854
02:00:17,252 --> 02:00:18,431
MATT: Which one are you choosing?

1855
02:00:18,431 --> 02:00:19,788
LAURA: Oh, I have to choose one

1856
02:00:19,788 --> 02:00:20,813
TALIESIN: Aberrations

1857
02:00:20,813 --> 02:00:21,888
MARISHA: Elemental?

1858
02:00:21,888 --> 02:00:22,833
LAURA: What do you think?

1859
02:00:22,833 --> 02:00:23,879
TRAVIS: I think you should just get all of them

1860
02:00:23,879 --> 02:00:26,360
LAURA: What do you think? Aberrations or-- what do
you think a kraken is?

1861
02:00:26,360 --> 02:00:27,573
SAM: Aberration? It's an animal.

1862
02:00:27,573 --> 02:00:31,054
MARISHA: You'll definitely find elementals because
they're definitely here.

1863
02:00:31,054 --> 02:00:32,720
LAURA: What would a kraken be?

1864
02:00:32,720 --> 02:00:33,744
TRAVIS: An animal.

1865
02:00:33,744 --> 02:00:35,321
LIAM: If it's not an aberration--

1866
02:00:35,321 --> 02:00:36,067
TALIESIN: An animal.

1867
02:00:36,067 --> 02:00:37,132
LIAM: It'd be a beast which you don't have--

1868
02:00:37,132 --> 02:00:37,998
TRAVIS: A mineral.

1869
02:00:37,998 --> 02:00:39,487
(all laugh)

1870
02:00:39,487 --> 02:00:40,150
LIAM: The only thing on there--

1871
02:00:40,150 --> 02:00:40,880
MARISHA: A mineral? (laughs)

1872
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:42,725
LIAM: The only thing on there-- that it is maybe
is an aberration.

1873
02:00:42,725 --> 02:00:43,401
LAURA: Aberration?

1874
02:00:43,401 --> 02:00:44,694
LIAM: I mean, elementals--

1875
02:00:44,694 --> 02:00:45,915
TALIESIN: They're not really aberrations.

1876
02:00:45,915 --> 02:00:46,776
SAM: They're aliens.

1877
02:00:46,776 --> 02:00:47,570
LAURA: No?

1878
02:00:47,570 --> 02:00:48,275
LIAM: There's nothing on this list.

1879
02:00:48,275 --> 02:00:51,187
LAURA: All right, then I'm going to try for
elementals.

1880
02:00:51,187 --> 02:00:58,547
MATT: Okay, you sit down and focus and dozens of
nearby signatures hit you, you're not quite sure

1881
02:00:58,547 --> 02:01:01,735
what direction they come from, but you know that
this area is teeming with elemental energy,

1882
02:01:01,766 --> 02:01:05,775
it has drawn many elemental powers nearby.

1883
02:01:05,775 --> 02:01:07,431
LAURA: They're like everywhere.

1884
02:01:07,431 --> 02:01:09,012
LIAM: They're all around us, man.

1885
02:01:09,012 --> 02:01:12,110
SAM: It's impossible, it's from inside the room!

1886
02:01:12,110 --> 02:01:14,908
MARISHA: They're in the walls, they're in the
goddamn walls!

1887
02:01:14,908 --> 02:01:18,546
TRAVIS: This is really important. I fart. Do the
bubbles go up?

1888
02:01:18,546 --> 02:01:20,863
MATT: (bubbling noise) They do.

1889
02:01:20,863 --> 02:01:22,607
TRAVIS: We're in a safe place.

1890
02:01:22,607 --> 02:01:24,030
TALIESIN: That was weirdly helpful.

1891
02:01:24,030 --> 02:01:24,714
MARISHA: Do I see that?

1892
02:01:24,714 --> 02:01:25,440
MATT: You do.

1893
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:26,717
MARISHA: That's actually insanely helpful.

1894
02:01:26,717 --> 02:01:27,831
TALIESIN: That's really, genuinely helpful.

1895
02:01:27,831 --> 02:01:30,071
(all laugh)

1896
02:01:30,071 --> 02:01:31,459
TALIESIN: Looking at--

1897
02:01:31,459 --> 02:01:33,455
SAM: (garbled voice) Should we use our
flashlights?

1898
02:01:33,455 --> 02:01:34,895
TALIESIN: (garbled voice) Why are you doing this
with your face?

1899
02:01:34,895 --> 02:01:35,702
MARISHA: (garbled voice) No!

1900
02:01:35,702 --> 02:01:37,612
TRAVIS: I don't know, I don't know!

1901
02:01:37,612 --> 02:01:38,533
SAM: (garbled voice) I don't know, it felt--

1902
02:01:38,533 --> 02:01:42,323
TRAVIS: Looking up, can you see any sort of
surface to the water, like you would if you were

1903
02:01:42,323 --> 02:01:45,471
150, 200 feet, scuba-diving down, and--

1904
02:01:45,471 --> 02:01:49,657
MATT: I mean, your vision in the vicinity is dark,
and you feel like you're at the bottom of a very,

1905
02:01:49,657 --> 02:01:56,397
very deep abyssal ocean. Looking up, you see a
faint turquoise glow in the upward direction but

1906
02:01:56,397 --> 02:02:01,379
it seems sourceless, almost as opposed to straight
up, it almost encompasses a full dome,

1907
02:02:01,379 --> 02:02:04,206
and you see no sign of a break in the water--

1908
02:02:04,206 --> 02:02:05,037
TRAVIS: That's what I thought.

1909
02:02:05,037 --> 02:02:10,998
MATT: -- and the various strands of plant life
extend far into the darkness and strange kind of

1910
02:02:10,998 --> 02:02:13,711
fuzzy distance where they fade out.

1911
02:02:13,711 --> 02:02:14,730
TRAVIS: We in it.

1912
02:02:14,730 --> 02:02:17,415
LAURA: I have a feeling light will attract all
sorts of creatures down here

1913
02:02:17,415 --> 02:02:18,097
TRAVIS: Yes.

1914
02:02:18,097 --> 02:02:20,491
TALIESIN: I'm not entirely sure the creatures down
here have eyes.

1915
02:02:20,491 --> 02:02:21,929
LAURA: Hm.

1916
02:02:21,929 --> 02:02:25,129
MARISHA: Most do have blindsight or echo-location,
so they--

1917
02:02:25,129 --> 02:02:29,844
LAURA: Hm, what about those kind of fish that have
the--

1918
02:02:29,844 --> 02:02:30,925
MARISHA: Might not be good for us.

1919
02:02:30,925 --> 02:02:31,543
TRAVIS: Yep.

1920
02:02:31,543 --> 02:02:32,778
LAURA: -- things that dangle in front of their
faces?

1921
02:02:32,778 --> 02:02:33,745
MARISHA: Angler fish, yeah.

1922
02:02:33,745 --> 02:02:35,516
TRAVIS: Movement, light, shiny things, all bad.

1923
02:02:35,516 --> 02:02:36,535
MARISHA: Mm-hm.

1924
02:02:36,535 --> 02:02:37,431
LIAM: Tary's armor.

1925
02:02:37,431 --> 02:02:38,624
LAURA: He's covered.

1926
02:02:38,624 --> 02:02:39,360
SAM: Thank you.

1927
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:42,092
MARISHA: Do we have a few minutes? I can do a
quick Locate Object spell,

1928
02:02:42,092 --> 02:02:43,844
see if we're headed in the right direction if 
you wanna--

1929
02:02:43,844 --> 02:02:45,940
LAURA: I'm going to use a Locate Object spell

1930
02:02:45,940 --> 02:02:49,108
MARISHA: Can I assist her in any way?

1931
02:02:49,108 --> 02:02:51,718
MATT: Nope, this is her particular spell to cast.

1932
02:02:51,718 --> 02:02:52,719
MARISHA: All right.

1933
02:02:52,719 --> 02:03:00,019
TALIESIN: I'm going to examine the sand, and just
gently dig around to see what's around.

1934
02:03:00,019 --> 02:03:02,717
This is fascinating, I'm just digging for 
whatever.

1935
02:03:02,717 --> 02:03:09,120
MATT: Okay. Your feet hit and pull apart, and as
soon as you do, you get about four inches of the

1936
02:03:09,120 --> 02:03:12,177
soft sand before you start hitting black dirt.

1937
02:03:12,272 --> 02:03:16,530
That immediately starts to cloud and obscure
your vicinity,

1938
02:03:16,530 --> 02:03:18,352
so you carefully stop for a second.

1939
02:03:18,352 --> 02:03:19,797
TALIESIN: Good to know.

1940
02:03:19,797 --> 02:03:20,735
MARISHA: Wow.

1941
02:03:20,735 --> 02:03:28,373
SAM: I'm going to load up my flashlight with one
of those Daylight gems,

1942
02:03:28,493 --> 02:03:32,994
but with the lens fully closed, so no light can 
escape.

1943
02:03:32,994 --> 02:03:35,407
MATT: Okay, so you go ahead and you activate, so
mark off another one of your opals.

1944
02:03:35,407 --> 02:03:36,280
SAM: Sure.

1945
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:37,395
TALIESIN: There's a red filter.

1946
02:03:37,395 --> 02:03:40,806
MATT: As you activate it as soon as you close the
device, and you feel it contained within.

1947
02:03:40,806 --> 02:03:41,641
SAM: Okay.

1948
02:03:41,641 --> 02:03:43,384
TALIESIN: You do have a red filter?

1949
02:03:43,384 --> 02:03:46,717
MATT: All right, you cast Locate Object, Laura?

1950
02:03:46,717 --> 02:03:47,206
LAURA: Yes.

1951
02:03:47,206 --> 02:03:52,538
MATT: All right, so as Vex, you focus,
concentrating

1952
02:03:52,538 --> 02:03:55,898
on the lodestone that you saw before.

1953
02:03:55,938 --> 02:03:59,579
TRAVIS: Through the portal behind you.

1954
02:03:59,802 --> 02:04:01,294
LAURA: No no no, it finds similar objects.

1955
02:04:01,294 --> 02:04:05,533
TRAVIS: I know, I know, I know.

1956
02:04:05,533 --> 02:04:12,743
MATT: Let's see, you feel the direction pull you
this way.

1957
02:04:12,743 --> 02:04:14,278
LAURA: Awesome.

1958
02:04:14,278 --> 02:04:17,201
MATT: You don't know how far away, but the
distance pulls you in that direction.

1959
02:04:17,201 --> 02:04:22,351
LAURA: There is a lodestone within a thousand feet
that direction.

1960
02:04:22,351 --> 02:04:26,391
MARISHA: You know, Taryon just gave me an idea.

1961
02:04:26,391 --> 02:04:30,419
SAM: I tend to have that effect on people.

1962
02:04:30,419 --> 02:04:36,579
MARISHA: Thank you for your infinite wisdom,
Taryon. We might be able to use a Daylight spell

1963
02:04:36,579 --> 02:04:41,529
as a distraction worst case scenario, because I
can place it somewhere and then leave it.

1964
02:04:41,529 --> 02:04:42,979
LAURA: Oh, that is smart.

1965
02:04:42,979 --> 02:04:43,793
MARISHA: Yeah.

1966
02:04:43,793 --> 02:04:47,012
TALIESIN: If we have to use an opal we can.

1967
02:04:47,012 --> 02:04:47,726
SAM: Sure.

1968
02:04:47,726 --> 02:04:49,772
TALIESIN: So, we can be far away when we activate
it.

1969
02:04:49,772 --> 02:04:50,636
TRAVIS: How far away can you place that?

1970
02:04:50,636 --> 02:04:52,132
LAURA: She can cast it on an object and leave it
behind.

1971
02:04:52,132 --> 02:04:54,621
MARISHA: I can leave it. As a distraction.

1972
02:04:54,621 --> 02:04:56,033
TRAVIS: Right.

1973
02:04:56,033 --> 02:04:56,682
LAURA: You could--

1974
02:04:56,682 --> 02:04:57,892
TALIESIN: Let's not cast it near the portal,
though.

1975
02:04:57,892 --> 02:04:59,613
MARISHA: I don't wanna do it right now, but I'm
just throwing it out there--

1976
02:04:59,613 --> 02:05:02,207
LAURA: -- cast it on the tip of an arrow and I can
shoot it at least 150 feet.

1977
02:05:02,302 --> 02:05:03,393
MARISHA: That's a hundred percent true, we've done
that before.

1978
02:05:03,393 --> 02:05:04,970
TALIESIN: Very good.

1979
02:05:04,970 --> 02:05:08,995
MARISHA: Just keep that in mind. All right. Yeah.
All right.

1980
02:05:08,995 --> 02:05:10,285
TALIESIN: Filing it away.

1981
02:05:10,285 --> 02:05:13,883
MARISHA: Okay, we have a direction, are we ready?

1982
02:05:13,985 --> 02:05:17,090
LAURA: Let's try to move stealthily, for a little
while.

1983
02:05:17,090 --> 02:05:21,408
Or should I just drop it and cast Pass
Without A Trace right now?

1984
02:05:21,408 --> 02:05:23,710
TALIESIN: Let's see how we feel?

1985
02:05:23,710 --> 02:05:26,939
MARISHA: Let's see how we feel. I'll go ahead and
do Pass Without A Trace on us

1986
02:05:26,939 --> 02:05:29,760
and we'll try and move in the direction that 
she called.

1987
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:31,409
LAURA: Oh good call. All right.

1988
02:05:31,409 --> 02:05:35,489
MATT: Okay. So, I need all of you to roll-- is
Trinket still in your necklace?

1989
02:05:35,489 --> 02:05:38,191
LAURA: (with hesitation) Okay.

1990
02:05:38,191 --> 02:05:39,397
(all laugh)

1991
02:05:39,397 --> 02:05:40,832
MATT: That's not an answer.

1992
02:05:40,832 --> 02:05:43,504
LAURA: I hadn't imagined him in but--

1993
02:05:43,504 --> 02:05:47,554
TALIESIN: Everybody knows about the sea bear.

1994
02:05:47,554 --> 02:05:48,763
LAURA: Yeah, he's going to turn into an animal
so--

1995
02:05:48,763 --> 02:05:49,754
LIAM: A killer whale, we talked about.

1996
02:05:49,754 --> 02:05:50,681
MARISHA: Whenever he's ready.

1997
02:05:50,681 --> 02:05:51,200
TALIESIN: When it's time.

1998
02:05:51,200 --> 02:05:52,512
LAURA: Let's bring Trinket out. Fuck it!

1999
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:53,894
LIAM: Yeah! Killer whale Trinket man.

2000
02:05:53,894 --> 02:05:55,398
MARISHA: He does have Water Breathing cast on
him.

2001
02:05:55,398 --> 02:05:55,994
LAURA: Yeah.

2002
02:05:55,994 --> 02:05:56,907
MATT: Yes, this is true.

2003
02:05:56,907 --> 02:05:57,734
LAURA: So he can fucking swim.

2004
02:05:57,734 --> 02:06:01,858
MATT: Yes. Trinket does not have goggles. And
cannot talk or cast spells underwater.

2005
02:06:01,858 --> 02:06:02,968
LAURA: Well.

2006
02:06:02,968 --> 02:06:04,099
MARISHA: I mean, he's a bear.

2007
02:06:04,099 --> 02:06:05,464
MATT: I know. I know.

2008
02:06:05,464 --> 02:06:06,503
LAURA: What if-- Okay.

2009
02:06:06,503 --> 02:06:08,334
MATT: As soon as Trinket (splash)

2010
02:06:08,334 --> 02:06:10,537
LIAM: He's having a singular experience for a
bear, though.

2011
02:06:10,537 --> 02:06:11,875
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

2012
02:06:11,875 --> 02:06:13,576
MATT: (confused bear noises)

2013
02:06:13,576 --> 02:06:16,261
LAURA: It's fun, buddy?

2014
02:06:16,261 --> 02:06:18,994
TRAVIS: You give him a hard time. Like trying to
get a rat in a bath.

2015
02:06:18,994 --> 02:06:20,449
LAURA: Oh god. No, no, no.

2016
02:06:20,449 --> 02:06:21,910
LIAM: I just (mimes scratching Trinket).

2017
02:06:21,910 --> 02:06:22,814
MARISHA: Oh no.

2018
02:06:22,814 --> 02:06:24,709
LAURA: I'm gonna cast, I'm gonna-- Fuck. I'm gonna
cast Speak With Animals on him.

2019
02:06:24,709 --> 02:06:25,555
TALIESIN: Anyone ever seen Bedknobs and
Broomsticks?

2020
02:06:25,555 --> 02:06:26,729
LAURA: Trinket?

2021
02:06:26,729 --> 02:06:29,032
MATT: Pass Without A Trace-- this is before or
after Pass Without A Trace?

2022
02:06:29,032 --> 02:06:30,109
LAURA: Oh, she's casting Pass Without A Trace.

2023
02:06:30,109 --> 02:06:31,339
MARISHA: No, I'm doing Pass Without A Trace.

2024
02:06:31,339 --> 02:06:32,175
MATT: Oh. That's right, yeah.

2025
02:06:32,175 --> 02:06:33,508
LAURA: I'm casting Speak With Animals.

2026
02:06:33,508 --> 02:06:35,235
MATT: That's right.

2027
02:06:35,359 --> 02:06:38,853
LAURA: Trinket, everything's fine! You're just
underwater.

2028
02:06:38,853 --> 02:06:40,711
MATT: (confused bear noises) "It's very wet."

2029
02:06:40,711 --> 02:06:41,982
LAURA: It is.

2030
02:06:41,982 --> 02:06:43,277
MATT: "What's going on?"

2031
02:06:43,277 --> 02:06:44,368
(all laugh)

2032
02:06:44,368 --> 02:06:48,524
LAURA: We're going to be swimming for a while.
You're gonna make me cry, dear. We're going to be

2033
02:06:48,524 --> 02:06:53,300
swimming for a little while, all right? Do you
feel okay with this?

2034
02:06:53,300 --> 02:06:54,744
MATT: (distressed bear noises)

2035
02:06:54,744 --> 02:06:55,934
TRAVIS: You're drowning him, baby.

2036
02:06:55,934 --> 02:06:59,521
LAURA: He can breathe, just breathe in. Just like
land, only not.

2037
02:06:59,521 --> 02:07:05,915
MATT: (bear noises) He kinda lands in the sand.
Looks around, very nervously.

2038
02:07:05,915 --> 02:07:13,966
Looks at one of the nearby kinda floating 
pieces of weird errant plant matter and--

2039
02:07:13,966 --> 02:07:15,764
(all laugh)

2040
02:07:15,764 --> 02:07:19,264
LAURA: Yeah. We're good? Are you all right?

2041
02:07:19,264 --> 02:07:20,099
MATT: "I'm okay."

2042
02:07:20,099 --> 02:07:25,010
LAURA: All right. Just giving you a heads up; you
may be turned into a whale in a little bit.

2043
02:07:25,010 --> 02:07:28,075
MATT: "What is a whale?"

2044
02:07:28,075 --> 02:07:33,949
(all laugh)

2045
02:07:33,949 --> 02:07:43,372
LAURA: You'll be really, really big and you'll be
able to swim a lot better. All right? Just

2046
02:07:43,372 --> 02:07:49,248
remember to follow my lead. And I'm gonna hang
onto you when you are a whale, all right?

2047
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:50,178
MATT: "Okay."

2048
02:07:50,178 --> 02:07:51,071
LAURA: Okay. I love you.

2049
02:07:51,071 --> 02:07:51,844
MATT: "I trust you."

2050
02:07:51,844 --> 02:07:56,517
LAURA: I trust you, too. I love you.

2051
02:07:56,517 --> 02:07:58,692
MATT: "Love you."

2052
02:07:58,692 --> 02:07:59,993
LAURA: I'm proud of you.

2053
02:07:59,993 --> 02:08:01,024
MATT: "Okay."

2054
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:03,601
LAURA: I love him so much. I love him!

2055
02:08:03,601 --> 02:08:04,771
TRAVIS: Say goodbye to him.

2056
02:08:04,878 --> 02:08:06,301
LAURA: Shut up!

2057
02:08:06,301 --> 02:08:08,458
MATT: The slowest. You see him start like, just
bear-paddling a little, under the water just like--

2058
02:08:08,458 --> 02:08:16,201
LAURA: It's fun, see? It's fun. But paddle
quietly, dear, we're trying to be stealthy!

2059
02:08:16,201 --> 02:08:17,557
MATT: "Mm-hm. Okay."

2060
02:08:17,557 --> 02:08:18,297
LAURA: Okay.

2061
02:08:18,297 --> 02:08:19,795
MATT: Now are you casting-- Oh, no. You're casting
Pass Without a Trace,

2062
02:08:19,795 --> 02:08:21,011
I want everyone to make stealth checks.

2063
02:08:21,011 --> 02:08:22,022
LAURA: I love him. Aw.

2064
02:08:22,022 --> 02:08:23,146
LIAM: Fucking D&amp;D, man.

2065
02:08:23,146 --> 02:08:24,291
SAM: Stealth checks! Stealth checks!

2066
02:08:24,291 --> 02:08:24,990
TALIESIN: Okay. Stealth checks.

2067
02:08:24,990 --> 02:08:26,182
MATT: Stealth checks. All of you guys including
Trinket, please.

2068
02:08:26,182 --> 02:08:27,117
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

2069
02:08:27,117 --> 02:08:27,968
TRAVIS: Don't fuck me, Gil.

2070
02:08:27,968 --> 02:08:28,807
TALIESIN: Yay.

2071
02:08:28,807 --> 02:08:30,402
MARISHA: I'm crying so hard. Oh wait, we're all
doing them.

2072
02:08:30,402 --> 02:08:32,402
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry for doing that to you. It
was really unfair.

2073
02:08:32,402 --> 02:08:34,390
TRAVIS: 25.

2074
02:08:34,390 --> 02:08:35,551
MARISHA: Oh, that's good! That's good.

2075
02:08:35,551 --> 02:08:37,114
TALIESIN: Plus ten?

2076
02:08:37,114 --> 02:08:38,144
TRAVIS: 25.

2077
02:08:38,144 --> 02:08:39,151
MATT: 25, right.

2078
02:08:39,151 --> 02:08:42,086
SAM: 20! With our boost.

2079
02:08:42,086 --> 02:08:43,191
LAURA: Oh, with Pass Without A Trace, right.

2080
02:08:43,191 --> 02:08:44,287
LIAM: Yeah, add that ten, man.

2081
02:08:44,287 --> 02:08:45,355
MARISHA: Yeah, 34.

2082
02:08:45,355 --> 02:08:46,288
TALIESIN: 33.

2083
02:08:46,288 --> 02:08:47,400
LIAM: 38.

2084
02:08:47,400 --> 02:08:48,327
TALIESIN: Hut hut!

2085
02:08:48,327 --> 02:08:49,641
MATT: Rogues!

2086
02:08:49,641 --> 02:08:50,555
LIAM: It's all I do.

2087
02:08:50,555 --> 02:08:51,844
TRAVIS: Yeah, man.

2088
02:08:51,844 --> 02:08:53,257
TALIESIN: They get the job done

2089
02:08:53,257 --> 02:08:56,625
MARISHA: Rogues! They get the job done.

2090
02:08:56,625 --> 02:08:57,406
LAURA: I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I don't know what to
add for Trinket's stealth.

2091
02:08:57,406 --> 02:08:58,390
Is that just his dex maybe?

2092
02:08:58,390 --> 02:08:59,220
MATT: It's his dex, yeah.

2093
02:08:59,220 --> 02:09:00,128
LAURA: Okay, so 29 for me.

2094
02:09:00,128 --> 02:09:00,978
MATT: All right.

2095
02:09:00,978 --> 02:09:04,467
LAURA: And 30 for Trinket.

2096
02:09:04,467 --> 02:09:05,881
TALIESIN: He kind of looks like kelp --

2097
02:09:05,881 --> 02:09:06,461
TRAVIS: Yeah?

2098
02:09:06,461 --> 02:09:07,406
TALIESIN: -- maybe he's blending

2099
02:09:07,406 --> 02:09:08,306
LIAM: He's just underwater ballet-ing, man

2100
02:09:08,306 --> 02:09:09,042
MATT: What'd you roll for Trinket?

2101
02:09:09,042 --> 02:09:09,675
TRAVIS: 18.

2102
02:09:09,675 --> 02:09:10,442
LAURA: 18.

2103
02:09:10,442 --> 02:09:11,082
LIAM: Not making a sound.

2104
02:09:11,082 --> 02:09:11,588
MATT: Nice!

2105
02:09:11,588 --> 02:09:12,416
MARISHA: Oh my god.

2106
02:09:12,416 --> 02:09:13,414
TALIESIN: It's just a face in a giant brown--

2107
02:09:13,414 --> 02:09:15,382
MATT: All right.

2108
02:09:15,382 --> 02:09:16,100
LIAM: Gently.

2109
02:09:16,100 --> 02:09:17,613
LAURA: Let me make sure I'm right on mine.

2110
02:09:17,613 --> 02:09:18,900
MATT: You guys (water sound effects) start very
quietly

2111
02:09:18,900 --> 02:09:21,128
as you can begin walking across the bottom
of the floor--

2112
02:09:21,128 --> 02:09:22,866
TALIESIN, MARISHA: (Darth Vader-esque breathing
effect)

2113
02:09:22,866 --> 02:09:27,760
MATT: -- barely, your toes barely touching the
surface of the bottom. Making your way in this

2114
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:33,266
direction. You guys slowly begin to shift this
way. Following this path.

2115
02:09:33,266 --> 02:09:34,918
Now you're maintaining Locate Object, you said?

2116
02:09:34,918 --> 02:09:35,842
LAURA: Yes, I am.

2117
02:09:35,842 --> 02:09:36,679
LIAM: I thought it was one of these.

2118
02:09:36,679 --> 02:09:37,838
MATT: Now you cast--

2119
02:09:37,838 --> 02:09:38,786
LAURA: Oh.

2120
02:09:38,786 --> 02:09:39,897
MATT: Is Speak With Animals a--

2121
02:09:39,897 --> 02:09:43,245
LAURA: Concentration? It's not.

2122
02:09:43,245 --> 02:09:44,084
TALIESIN: Let's hunt some scallops.

2123
02:09:44,084 --> 02:09:45,041
MARISHA: Hunt some scallops.

2124
02:09:45,041 --> 02:09:47,219
MATT: It is! Concentration up to ten minutes.
Locate Object is ten minutes.

2125
02:09:47,219 --> 02:09:48,317
Oh, Speak With Animals is not, sorry.

2126
02:09:48,317 --> 02:09:49,156
LAURA: No.

2127
02:09:49,156 --> 02:09:50,297
MATT: Sorry. Then you're fine.

2128
02:09:50,297 --> 02:09:51,515
LAURA: Okay.

2129
02:09:51,515 --> 02:09:52,447
MARISHA: Calamari.

2130
02:09:52,447 --> 02:09:53,229
LIAM: Get some butter from the jug.

2131
02:09:53,229 --> 02:09:54,225
MARISHA: Some Grog aioli, a lil bit of mayo,
lemon.

2132
02:09:54,225 --> 02:09:57,543
TRAVIS: Do we see anything swimming above us or
around us?

2133
02:09:57,543 --> 02:10:06,365
MATT: Looking in your vicinity, you see clusters
of ruins, you see broken pieces of very, very old

2134
02:10:06,365 --> 02:10:17,519
stonework. And looking at them, they are scattered
throughout the vicinity. Singular chunks of

2135
02:10:17,519 --> 02:10:28,492
structures. Let's see. Percival, go ahead and make
an intelligence check.

2136
02:10:28,492 --> 02:10:31,188
TALIESIN: That'll do. 20.

2137
02:10:31,188 --> 02:10:36,011
MATT: Okay. Looking to the left of you as you pass
by this one structure, you can see the chunk of

2138
02:10:36,011 --> 02:10:43,112
wall that's visible, it is thick enough and tall
enough where it looks like it's a sliver of the

2139
02:10:43,112 --> 02:10:52,470
base of a larger structure that was designed for
far larger creatures. The sense of the erosion and

2140
02:10:52,470 --> 02:10:58,101
the relatively smooth edges of the various broken
parts to it tell you

2141
02:10:58,101 --> 02:11:00,078
that it's been there for a very long time.

2142
02:11:00,078 --> 02:11:03,540
TALIESIN: This was for a larger creature, like,
giants?

2143
02:11:03,540 --> 02:11:10,437
MATT: Giants or larger. It's hard to really tell.
This is not a human-sized--

2144
02:11:10,535 --> 02:11:15,476
TALIESIN: Did these ruins crumble, or did they
sink?

2145
02:11:15,476 --> 02:11:19,695
MATT: They appear to have crumbled. The structure
in which they're placed

2146
02:11:19,695 --> 02:11:23,846
has intentional placement within here.

2147
02:11:23,846 --> 02:11:31,132
TALIESIN: And is the stone-- does the stone feel
natural, or does it feel like stone that would be

2148
02:11:31,132 --> 02:11:35,873
underwater? Does it look like the parts of it that
have been underwater are doing well, or does it

2149
02:11:35,873 --> 02:11:39,978
look like it's eroding as something that should've
been above the surface?

2150
02:11:39,988 --> 02:11:46,240
MATT: It looks like they're eroding as expected
for something that's been there for a very long time.

2151
02:11:46,240 --> 02:11:47,994
TALIESIN: And there's no writing visible.

2152
02:11:47,994 --> 02:11:55,937
MATT: No, no. They're almost extremely smooth.
Just been there for so long and hit with various

2153
02:11:55,937 --> 02:11:59,884
blasts of water current, sand, dust, and other
things for such a long

2154
02:11:59,884 --> 02:12:03,168
period of time that it's smoothed the 
entirety of the wall structure.

2155
02:12:03,168 --> 02:12:04,488
TALIESIN: Okay.

2156
02:12:04,488 --> 02:12:06,094
MATT: All right, you maintain the Locate Object?

2157
02:12:06,094 --> 02:12:06,906
LAURA: Mm-hm.

2158
02:12:06,906 --> 02:12:14,878
MATT: As you guys push forward, eventually it
leads you this way, until you begin to feel the

2159
02:12:14,878 --> 02:12:23,652
direction change this path, there. So you lead the
path over this way,

2160
02:12:23,652 --> 02:12:31,019
and it leads you to the edge of this wall.

2161
02:12:31,019 --> 02:12:32,871
SAM: Do you need some help finding it?

2162
02:12:32,871 --> 02:12:37,345
LAURA: Can I look around? Does it seem like it's
right there?

2163
02:12:37,345 --> 02:12:38,551
MATT: Make a perception check.

2164
02:12:38,551 --> 02:12:46,679
LAURA: Okay. 25.

2165
02:12:46,679 --> 02:12:51,445
MATT: Glancing about the vicinity, looking over it
all, you look at the wall, it's smooth, there's no

2166
02:12:51,445 --> 02:12:54,891
indentation, there's no sign of a stone. Looking
at the sand

2167
02:12:54,891 --> 02:12:58,482
on the ground at the base of it, no
sign of a stone.

2168
02:12:58,482 --> 02:13:02,596
LAURA: Can I move some of the sand out of the way
on the ground and see if I see anything?

2169
02:13:02,596 --> 02:13:04,102
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2170
02:13:04,102 --> 02:13:04,912
TALIESIN: Compass.

2171
02:13:04,912 --> 02:13:07,249
SAM: Compass, yeah.

2172
02:13:07,249 --> 02:13:11,674
LAURA: Ten. Yeah, bust out that compass.

2173
02:13:11,674 --> 02:13:14,169
MATT: Yeah, you begin to pull apart some of the
sand,

2174
02:13:14,169 --> 02:13:18,768
and the black murkiness begins to come up
underneath, and you don't see anything.

2175
02:13:18,768 --> 02:13:23,044
MARISHA: I stand watch while they do this and just
look for any movement.

2176
02:13:23,044 --> 02:13:24,918
MATT: Perception check.

2177
02:13:24,918 --> 02:13:26,627
SAM: Is the compass moving?

2178
02:13:26,627 --> 02:13:27,635
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil.

2179
02:13:27,635 --> 02:13:30,195
MATT: The compass is currently focused on the same
direction that you're moving, towards the wall.

2180
02:13:30,195 --> 02:13:31,370
LIAM: I'm going to join Keyleth as well.

2181
02:13:31,370 --> 02:13:33,014
SAM: I'm gonna cast Detect Magic.

2182
02:13:33,014 --> 02:13:36,172
MARISHA: 25. No, 27. Sorry.

2183
02:13:36,172 --> 02:13:43,681
MATT: Okay. Nice. You glance this way, as you're
looking overhead, you can see a dark, very large

2184
02:13:43,681 --> 02:13:52,143
dark shape right about here, looks to be the shelf
of some sort of an underwater stone cliff or a

2185
02:13:52,143 --> 02:13:57,565
mountain of some kind that leads up here like a
bank. At the very top, you see very faint

2186
02:13:57,565 --> 02:14:02,929
movement. Looks like individual, long tendrils of
some kind,

2187
02:14:02,929 --> 02:14:06,035
just barely visible at the outside of your 
dark vision.

2188
02:14:06,035 --> 02:14:14,304
MARISHA: I come over the intercom and say, Be very
quiet. Very still. Very slow.

2189
02:14:14,304 --> 02:14:17,773
SAM: I don't hear that, so I just cast Detect
Magic.

2190
02:14:17,773 --> 02:14:20,829
MARISHA: Oh, son of a fuck, you don't.
Motherfucker.

2191
02:14:20,829 --> 02:14:26,262
MATT: Okay. So you cast Detect Magic. You
currently, in front of you, don't see any sort of

2192
02:14:26,262 --> 02:14:29,985
magical source. Nothing seems to glow or emanate
at the wall or near the base of the wall.

2193
02:14:29,985 --> 02:14:31,500
SAM: Within 30 feet.

2194
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:32,555
MATT: Right.

2195
02:14:32,555 --> 02:14:35,696
SAM: Even under three feet of sand.

2196
02:14:35,696 --> 02:14:39,846
MATT: Let me double-check something here for you.

2197
02:14:39,846 --> 02:14:44,555
LAURA: I'm gonna wander to the other side of the
wall and see if it's on the other side.

2198
02:14:44,555 --> 02:14:47,574
TALIESIN: I'm with you.

2199
02:14:47,574 --> 02:14:50,146
SAM: One foot of stone, one inch of metal.

2200
02:14:50,146 --> 02:14:56,315
MATT: Okay, you faint-- You still feel the
direction of the magic where you're looking, but

2201
02:14:56,315 --> 02:14:59,525
you don't see anything on or around the base of
the wall. Do you move around?

2202
02:14:59,525 --> 02:15:00,539
LAURA: To the other side of the wall, yeah.

2203
02:15:00,539 --> 02:15:01,538
PERCY: Yeah, we're moving there.

2204
02:15:01,538 --> 02:15:02,354
SAM: I'll come with.

2205
02:15:02,354 --> 02:15:04,169
MATT: As you and Percy find yourself at the other
side of the wall, there.

2206
02:15:04,169 --> 02:15:06,127
MARISHA: Still keeping an eye on the dark figure.

2207
02:15:06,127 --> 02:15:11,023
MATT: The direction of the Locate Object leads you
adjacent and just beyond the wall

2208
02:15:11,023 --> 02:15:12,736
on the other side of where you guys were looking.

2209
02:15:12,736 --> 02:15:16,052
LAURA: Ah, that makes sense. Do I see it now?

2210
02:15:16,052 --> 02:15:16,988
MATT: You do not see anything.

2211
02:15:16,988 --> 02:15:19,701
TALIESIN: I'm going to gently pat at the base of
the wall.

2212
02:15:19,701 --> 02:15:22,307
MATT: Okay, both of you guys make investigation
checks, please.

2213
02:15:22,307 --> 02:15:30,199
TALIESIN: Not disturbing anything. Investigation?
13.

2214
02:15:30,298 --> 02:15:32,733
LAURA: (high-pitched) Nine.

2215
02:15:32,733 --> 02:15:36,397
MATT: You're both digging through and pulling at
the sand,

2216
02:15:36,397 --> 02:15:39,158
and dig further and it causes the black---

2217
02:15:39,158 --> 02:15:41,378
LAURA: We're digging softly, we're trying not to
do that.

2218
02:15:41,378 --> 02:15:42,290
TALIESIN: Very gently.

2219
02:15:42,290 --> 02:15:43,609
SAM: I'm coming too, I want to--

2220
02:15:43,609 --> 02:15:46,501
TALIESIN: If anything we're sucking at this.

2221
02:15:46,501 --> 02:15:48,451
SAM: And I'm going to cast Detect Magic again.

2222
02:15:48,451 --> 02:15:55,307
MATT: Focusing, you do feel a very, very faint
magical essence from the sand about two feet to

2223
02:15:55,307 --> 02:15:58,234
the left of where they're currently sifting
through the sand.

2224
02:15:58,338 --> 02:16:01,777
LAURA: Shh, shh, shh!

2225
02:16:01,777 --> 02:16:02,866
TALIESIN: Shh!

2226
02:16:02,866 --> 02:16:06,255
SAM: Oh, okay, Jesus! I'm just trying to help us
find the fucking lodestones.

2227
02:16:06,255 --> 02:16:07,791
LAURA: We move over there to start digging.

2228
02:16:07,791 --> 02:16:11,994
MATT: Start pulling through, you get past the
sand, you get to some of the black murkiness and

2229
02:16:11,994 --> 02:16:16,249
you're careful and start digging before (clunk)
you feel one of your fingers

2230
02:16:16,249 --> 02:16:19,026
hit a hard surface and you begin to 
pull underneath.

2231
02:16:19,026 --> 02:16:20,942
LAURA: I think we found one!

2232
02:16:20,942 --> 02:16:25,441
MATT: You pull and begin clearing the space around
it, and it takes you a minute or so with the help

2233
02:16:25,441 --> 02:16:30,260
of both Taryon and Percival, but you dig enough of
this sand and soot from underneath to get around

2234
02:16:30,260 --> 02:16:36,001
and you have there, currently in your presence,
one of your lodestones.

2235
02:16:36,001 --> 02:16:40,677
LAURA: Do you think they'll know, if we grab it,
do you think it's going to attract anything?

2236
02:16:40,677 --> 02:16:43,370
TALIESIN: I think we put it in the bag of holding
and it won't matter.

2237
02:16:43,370 --> 02:16:44,545
LAURA: Grog.

2238
02:16:44,545 --> 02:16:45,863
MARISHA: I'll watch.

2239
02:16:45,863 --> 02:16:47,521
LAURA: Can you swim over here?

2240
02:16:47,521 --> 02:16:50,496
TRAVIS: I slowly make my way to the other side of
the wall.

2241
02:16:50,496 --> 02:16:51,700
TALIESIN: I imagine like Neil Armstrong.

2242
02:16:51,700 --> 02:16:54,176
MATT: Over the wall, meet the rest of your
allies.

2243
02:16:54,273 --> 02:16:59,090
LAURA: We lift it, and put it in the Bag of
Holding.

2244
02:16:59,090 --> 02:17:01,280
TRAVIS: Okay.

2245
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:07,524
MATT: It fits inside, vanishes, you feel this
slight vibration in your fingers as you take the

2246
02:17:07,524 --> 02:17:13,469
stone and slowly relinquish it to the bag of
holding's entry port. It vanishes within.

2247
02:17:13,469 --> 02:17:19,034
LAURA: Hey, one down! Do I sense another one with
my Locate Object spell?

2248
02:17:19,034 --> 02:17:23,617
MATT: You do, you get a sense of something in this
direction.

2249
02:17:23,617 --> 02:17:24,681
LAURA: All right.

2250
02:17:24,681 --> 02:17:26,387
MATT: Like a line pointing this way.

2251
02:17:26,387 --> 02:17:27,638
LIAM: C-20.

2252
02:17:27,638 --> 02:17:30,027
(all laugh)

2253
02:17:30,027 --> 02:17:31,046
MARISHA: Hit!

2254
02:17:31,046 --> 02:17:31,807
LAURA: All right.

2255
02:17:31,807 --> 02:17:32,695
TALIESIN: Let's curl around.

2256
02:17:32,695 --> 02:17:36,035
LAURA: Shall we hide, yeah, curve around so we can
hide from the big figure up top.

2257
02:17:36,035 --> 02:17:39,307
MARISHA: Yeah, I keep an eye on the big figure the
whole time.

2258
02:17:39,307 --> 02:17:40,941
MATT: All right, I need Percival--

2259
02:17:40,941 --> 02:17:42,655
SAM: Me too.

2260
02:17:42,655 --> 02:17:47,888
MATT: Tary, Vex, and Grog, who are moving
currently, to make stealth checks.

2261
02:17:47,888 --> 02:17:50,035
MARISHA: Come on.

2262
02:17:50,035 --> 02:17:52,768
SAM: 24.

2263
02:17:52,768 --> 02:17:54,786
TRAVIS: Come on, Gil.

2264
02:17:54,786 --> 02:17:55,757
LAURA: Woo.

2265
02:17:55,757 --> 02:17:57,078
TRAVIS: Nice.

2266
02:17:57,078 --> 02:17:58,178
TALIESIN: 33.

2267
02:17:58,178 --> 02:17:59,648
TRAVIS: Just regular, right? No plus ten.

2268
02:17:59,648 --> 02:18:00,463
LAURA: Yeah, plus ten.

2269
02:18:00,463 --> 02:18:01,195
LIAM: No, plus ten.

2270
02:18:01,195 --> 02:18:01,915
TALIESIN: Plus ten.

2271
02:18:01,915 --> 02:18:02,880
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry. 27.

2272
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:03,711
LAURA: 39.

2273
02:18:03,711 --> 02:18:04,700
LIAM: Good job, Gil.

2274
02:18:04,700 --> 02:18:05,235
MATT: All right.

2275
02:18:05,235 --> 02:18:06,378
MARISHA: Thanks, Gil.

2276
02:18:06,488 --> 02:18:09,574
MATT: Are you guys staying ground-level? Are you
curving over? Are you going around?

2277
02:18:09,574 --> 02:18:10,844
TALIESIN: We're going around.

2278
02:18:10,844 --> 02:18:14,544
LAURA: Going around. We're trying to keep as, you
know, stealthy as possible.

2279
02:18:14,544 --> 02:18:24,469
MATT: Right. So, you guys make your way around,
heading this direction, following Vex. As you

2280
02:18:24,586 --> 02:18:27,868
continue to curl forward, Vex, bringing your way
forward,

2281
02:18:27,868 --> 02:18:30,401
Trinket's kind of getting nervous of the distance.

2282
02:18:30,401 --> 02:18:33,475
LIAM: I start scootching him behind the ear, I
know this one spot behind his left ear

2283
02:18:33,475 --> 02:18:36,048
that calms him down, as I watch with Keyleth.

2284
02:18:36,048 --> 02:18:41,211
MATT: Okay, so you slowly meander up to the side
and help keep Trinket quiet for the time being.

2285
02:18:41,211 --> 02:18:45,689
SAM: A stream of diarrhea come out of his rear
end.

2286
02:18:45,689 --> 02:18:47,115
LIAM: Mixing in with the black sand.

2287
02:18:47,115 --> 02:18:48,071
MATT: Oh, god.

2288
02:18:48,071 --> 02:18:50,230
LIAM: Like a squid in his own right.

2289
02:18:50,230 --> 02:18:51,525
MATT: You guys follow behind and--

2290
02:18:51,525 --> 02:18:54,089
LAURA: Do we sense any kind of movement around us
or anything?

2291
02:18:54,089 --> 02:18:57,235
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

2292
02:18:57,235 --> 02:19:00,302
TRAVIS: Yeah, I do that. Especially with that
giant red rock right there.

2293
02:19:00,302 --> 02:19:01,476
MARISHA: Do I do that too or no?

2294
02:19:01,476 --> 02:19:02,536
TALIESIN: No, I perceive nothing.

2295
02:19:02,536 --> 02:19:03,388
MATT: You're not looking.

2296
02:19:03,388 --> 02:19:04,121
MARISHA: I'm looking.

2297
02:19:04,121 --> 02:19:05,303
MATT: You're staying back with Vax.

2298
02:19:05,303 --> 02:19:06,183
TRAVIS: Oh! 16!

2299
02:19:06,183 --> 02:19:09,834
LAURA: Twenty... two. 21.

2300
02:19:09,834 --> 02:19:10,836
MATT: 21.

2301
02:19:10,836 --> 02:19:14,851
TALIESIN: One. I saw nothing.

2302
02:19:14,851 --> 02:19:24,665
MATT: Okay, yeah. You come to this heavy, heavy
piece of thick, natural wall-like stone that is

2303
02:19:24,665 --> 02:19:28,524
heavily embedded in the ground. This is not like
the previous ones that looked like it was carved,

2304
02:19:28,524 --> 02:19:33,936
this is just a natural formation of stone that is
jutting out of the sand, and it's a thick ten,

2305
02:19:33,936 --> 02:19:42,023
15-foot-wide embankment, maybe five feet thick and
about six feet above. As you approach and get to

2306
02:19:42,023 --> 02:19:49,019
it, you don't see anything that would mark it as
different other than a series of-- you start

2307
02:19:49,019 --> 02:19:54,503
looking down as you're inspecting and you see a
series of skulls, some humanoid, some larger, some

2308
02:19:54,503 --> 02:20:01,830
like almost elongated fish or crocodile-like jaws.
Some of them are older, some of them are fresher,

2309
02:20:01,830 --> 02:20:05,292
some of them still have like, bits of little
thin tendrils of flesh--

2310
02:20:05,292 --> 02:20:05,851
(all groan)

2311
02:20:05,901 --> 02:20:10,070
MATT: That is mostly decomposed that drift off and
change direction

2312
02:20:10,173 --> 02:20:12,176
with the flow of the water as you
make your way through.

2313
02:20:12,176 --> 02:20:13,978
SAM: Our masks are like--

2314
02:20:13,978 --> 02:20:15,408
LAURA: No, we got goggles.

2315
02:20:15,408 --> 02:20:16,445
MATT: It's goggles--

2316
02:20:16,445 --> 02:20:17,248
SAM: Just goggles.

2317
02:20:17,248 --> 02:20:18,969
MATT: And just this little stone right over the
larynx

2318
02:20:18,969 --> 02:20:20,682
SAM: So our mouth is free and--

2319
02:20:20,682 --> 02:20:21,503
TRAVIS: Free in the water

2320
02:20:21,503 --> 02:20:22,455
SAM: Okay, I vomit.

2321
02:20:22,455 --> 02:20:23,863
(all laugh)

2322
02:20:23,863 --> 02:20:28,340
MATT: (vomit sound, laughs) And this cloud of
green, yellow, and brown

2323
02:20:28,340 --> 02:20:34,556
just kind of emanates from the front of Taryon's 
face.

2324
02:20:34,556 --> 02:20:36,941
TRAVIS: Feed the fish. Wait, quick question.

2325
02:20:36,941 --> 02:20:41,748
Krakens don't like use shells do they like a
crab?

2326
02:20:41,748 --> 02:20:42,376
TALIESIN: No.

2327
02:20:42,376 --> 02:20:43,036
TRAVIS: Okay.

2328
02:20:43,036 --> 02:20:43,925
LIAM: They don't have fuck all.

2329
02:20:43,925 --> 02:20:44,784
LAURA: I mean, do they?

2330
02:20:44,784 --> 02:20:45,581
TALIESIN: They don't.

2331
02:20:45,581 --> 02:20:46,283
TRAVIS: Just checking.

2332
02:20:46,283 --> 02:20:47,554
TALIESIN: As far as I know.

2333
02:20:47,554 --> 02:20:50,078
LAURA: Can we start looking for the lodestone?

2334
02:20:50,078 --> 02:20:52,698
MATT: Investigation check. Who else is helping?

2335
02:20:52,698 --> 02:20:53,520
TALIESIN: I'll help.

2336
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:54,438
TRAVIS: No, no, I'm--

2337
02:20:54,438 --> 02:20:55,512
SAM: I'm looking at the compass.

2338
02:20:55,512 --> 02:20:56,515
TRAVIS: I'm keeping an eye out.

2339
02:20:56,515 --> 02:20:57,472
MATT: Yep, you're looking on the compass.

2340
02:20:57,472 --> 02:20:58,573
TRAVIS: I'm the lookout.

2341
02:20:58,573 --> 02:21:01,093
MATT: Grog's lookout, I just need Vex and Percy.

2342
02:21:01,093 --> 02:21:01,765
LAURA: 18.

2343
02:21:01,765 --> 02:21:02,699
MATT: 18.

2344
02:21:02,699 --> 02:21:03,629
TALIESIN: 13.

2345
02:21:03,629 --> 02:21:10,633
MATT: 13. You guys sift through the sand in this
vicinity, poring around, trying to kind of dig

2346
02:21:10,633 --> 02:21:15,553
across the exterior of the stone to pull away. You
spend a good two to three minutes or so

2347
02:21:15,553 --> 02:21:17,804
searching the vicinity and you don't find a stone.

2348
02:21:17,804 --> 02:21:18,861
LAURA: Can I use the compass?

2349
02:21:18,861 --> 02:21:19,657
MARISHA: No stone.

2350
02:21:19,657 --> 02:21:21,039
SAM: All right, I'll use Detect Magic again.

2351
02:21:21,039 --> 02:21:22,188
LAURA: Well, can I just use the compass?

2352
02:21:22,188 --> 02:21:22,909
MARISHA: Compass?

2353
02:21:22,909 --> 02:21:24,230
SAM: Yeah, what does it say?

2354
02:21:24,230 --> 02:21:26,187
MATT: It points in the direction you--

2355
02:21:26,187 --> 02:21:28,495
LAURA: I wanna take it and bring it down to the
ground and like--

2356
02:21:28,495 --> 02:21:29,455
MATT: Okay.

2357
02:21:29,455 --> 02:21:31,124
LAURA: Like a metal detector

2358
02:21:31,124 --> 02:21:34,777
MARISHA: Can I kind of start splitting the
difference in case anything bad happens?

2359
02:21:34,777 --> 02:21:36,427
MATT: Okay, so you start making your way this
way.

2360
02:21:36,427 --> 02:21:38,044
MARISHA: Just very slowly.

2361
02:21:38,044 --> 02:21:41,972
MATT: Okay. I need you to make a stealth check.

2362
02:21:41,972 --> 02:21:43,916
You as well.

2363
02:21:43,916 --> 02:21:45,482
LAURA: Oh god, oh god.

2364
02:21:45,482 --> 02:21:46,348
LIAM: Natural 20.

2365
02:21:46,348 --> 02:21:49,274
LAURA: I feel like something's bad.

2366
02:21:49,373 --> 02:21:50,741
MATT: Roll for Trinket.

2367
02:21:50,741 --> 02:21:52,382
SAM: This music is fucking creepy.

2368
02:21:52,382 --> 02:21:53,972
LAURA: Man. Why is it so tense?

2369
02:21:53,972 --> 02:21:55,183
MARISHA: 31 stealth.

2370
02:21:55,183 --> 02:21:55,917
MATT: Good.

2371
02:21:55,917 --> 02:21:58,759
TALIESIN: This Philip Glass nervous breakdown you're
giving us is really--

2372
02:21:58,759 --> 02:22:00,956
LAURA: That's good. 26 for Trinket.

2373
02:22:00,956 --> 02:22:02,020
TRAVIS: (mimics music)

2374
02:22:02,020 --> 02:22:03,079
SAM: (mimics music)

2375
02:22:03,079 --> 02:22:04,791
LIAM: 45. Natural 20.

2376
02:22:04,791 --> 02:22:05,779
MARISHA: (gasps)

2377
02:22:05,779 --> 02:22:06,556
SAM: 41?

2378
02:22:06,556 --> 02:22:07,530
LIAM: 45.

2379
02:22:07,530 --> 02:22:08,252
MATT: Holy shit!

2380
02:22:08,252 --> 02:22:08,920
MARISHA and SAM: 45?!

2381
02:22:08,920 --> 02:22:10,909
LIAM: See ya, mothafuckers!

2382
02:22:10,909 --> 02:22:11,846
MARISHA: That's your stealth?

2383
02:22:11,846 --> 02:22:13,039
(all laugh)

2384
02:22:13,039 --> 02:22:16,275
MATT: All right, you guys make your way between
areas as Trinket comes behind you--

2385
02:22:16,579 --> 02:22:17,585
MARISHA: My god, 45.

2386
02:22:17,585 --> 02:22:19,269
MATT: Don't want him to stray too far in this
circumstance.

2387
02:22:19,269 --> 02:22:20,701
SAM: I'm casting Detect Magic.

2388
02:22:20,701 --> 02:22:21,377
LAURA: And the compass.

2389
02:22:21,377 --> 02:22:22,353
MARISHA: And the compass.

2390
02:22:22,353 --> 02:22:23,295
TALIESIN: We think we find him and it's just a
rock.

2391
02:22:23,295 --> 02:22:24,431
TRAVIS: Hey, you two, it's not a race.

2392
02:22:24,431 --> 02:22:25,973
MARISHA: Yeah, hey Vax, oh fuck, it's a rock
again.

2393
02:22:25,973 --> 02:22:27,044
LAURA: Yes it is.

2394
02:22:27,044 --> 02:22:29,651
MATT: You sense the magical presence of it in the
direction that you've been facing,

2395
02:22:29,651 --> 02:22:31,542
but it seems further past.

2396
02:22:31,542 --> 02:22:34,680
SAM: Okay, keep going, it's around the rock.

2397
02:22:34,680 --> 02:22:35,562
TALIESIN: Rock.

2398
02:22:35,562 --> 02:22:37,686
LAURA: Again? Fuck! We go around the fucking
rock.

2399
02:22:37,686 --> 02:22:38,965
TRAVIS: You sure it's a rock?

2400
02:22:38,965 --> 02:22:40,350
LAURA: I don't know, Grog.

2401
02:22:40,350 --> 02:22:42,174
SAM: Oh wait a second! Eh, all right.

2402
02:22:42,174 --> 02:22:42,886
MATT: What?

2403
02:22:42,886 --> 02:22:44,615
SAM: Detect Magic lasts for ten minutes!

2404
02:22:44,615 --> 02:22:46,035
LAURA: So you don't have to cast again.

2405
02:22:46,035 --> 02:22:46,727
MARISHA: Yeah, it lasts for a while.

2406
02:22:46,727 --> 02:22:48,496
SAM: So this is all one spell, yeah?

2407
02:22:48,496 --> 02:22:53,455
MATT: Yeah, you can maintain the-- okay. So you go
with them?

2408
02:22:53,455 --> 02:22:54,124
SAM: Yeah!

2409
02:22:54,124 --> 02:22:56,796
MATT: Okay. Grog, you staying put or you going
with them?

2410
02:22:56,796 --> 02:22:57,720
TRAVIS: Staying there.

2411
02:22:57,720 --> 02:23:01,659
MATT: Okay. You all three searching, then?

2412
02:23:01,690 --> 02:23:02,619
SAM: Yes.

2413
02:23:02,619 --> 02:23:03,742
LAURA: Yes.

2414
02:23:03,742 --> 02:23:06,555
MATT: Investigation check, investigation check,
investigation check.

2415
02:23:06,555 --> 02:23:09,400
SAM: One.

2416
02:23:09,400 --> 02:23:12,998
TALIESIN: Ugh.

2417
02:23:12,998 --> 02:23:14,012
LAURA: 19.

2418
02:23:14,012 --> 02:23:15,191
MARISHA: Oh Jesus, I thought it was a one at
first.

2419
02:23:15,191 --> 02:23:16,319
TALIESIN: Nine.

2420
02:23:16,319 --> 02:23:17,372
MATT: Nine, and?

2421
02:23:17,372 --> 02:23:18,313
SAM: Five, I--

2422
02:23:18,313 --> 02:23:19,183
LAURA: 19.

2423
02:23:19,183 --> 02:23:20,483
SAM: I got a natural one.

2424
02:23:20,483 --> 02:23:21,130
MATT: You got a natural one?

2425
02:23:21,130 --> 02:23:22,085
SAM: Yeah.

2426
02:23:22,085 --> 02:23:22,902
MATT: Okay.

2427
02:23:22,902 --> 02:23:23,764
LAURA: Oh no.

2428
02:23:23,764 --> 02:23:25,545
SAM: The kraken eats me.

2429
02:23:25,545 --> 02:23:29,645
MATT: As you're digging through, your fingers,
Taryon--

2430
02:23:29,645 --> 02:23:30,382
SAM: Yes?

2431
02:23:30,382 --> 02:23:31,907
MATT: Hits something hard.

2432
02:23:31,907 --> 02:23:33,598
SAM: (gasps) I got it. I've got it!

2433
02:23:33,598 --> 02:23:34,520
LAURA: Shh!

2434
02:23:34,520 --> 02:23:35,279
TALIESIN: Shh.

2435
02:23:35,279 --> 02:23:36,138
SAM: I've got it!

2436
02:23:36,138 --> 02:23:37,298
(all shush)

2437
02:23:37,298 --> 02:23:44,088
MATT: As you pull up what you think is the stone,
you look, and instead it's a humanoid head that is

2438
02:23:44,088 --> 02:23:47,732
mostly skeletal bone with strips of flesh hanging
off of it

2439
02:23:47,732 --> 02:23:52,460
with one eye that is a pale swollen
pink-white color.

2440
02:23:52,460 --> 02:23:54,682
SAM: (gags)

2441
02:23:54,682 --> 02:23:59,613
MATT: Yeah, you just start like (gags) you
instinctively step back,

2442
02:23:59,613 --> 02:24:01,871
start yelling about the point there.

2443
02:24:01,871 --> 02:24:04,108
MARISHA: Richard Dreyfuss in Jaws.

2444
02:24:04,108 --> 02:24:08,647
MATT: Just for the sake of this, make a stealth
check.

2445
02:24:08,647 --> 02:24:10,891
MARISHA: Oh man, come on.

2446
02:24:10,891 --> 02:24:11,943
SAM: Natural one.

2447
02:24:11,943 --> 02:24:13,037
(all groan)

2448
02:24:13,037 --> 02:24:14,841
MARISHA: No, you are lying to me, you are lying!

2449
02:24:14,841 --> 02:24:17,357
LAURA: Put that dice away, put that dice away
right now!

2450
02:24:17,357 --> 02:24:18,151
LIAM: Two in a row?

2451
02:24:18,151 --> 02:24:18,868
SAM: Yeah!

2452
02:24:18,868 --> 02:24:19,659
MARISHA: No!

2453
02:24:19,659 --> 02:24:20,421
LIAM: Wow.

2454
02:24:20,421 --> 02:24:21,774
MARISHA: No, Tary!

2455
02:24:21,774 --> 02:24:22,739
LAURA: Tary! You're fucking us, Tary!

2456
02:24:22,739 --> 02:24:23,882
SAM: (gagging noises)

2457
02:24:23,882 --> 02:24:25,282
LIAM: (sings) Telling a story!

2458
02:24:25,282 --> 02:24:31,261
MATT: Holy shit. Okay. Keyleth, as you're
carefully looking up in the shadows, you watch as

2459
02:24:31,261 --> 02:24:37,448
this giant dark mound just diminishes and
vanishes.

2460
02:24:37,448 --> 02:24:38,707
TALIESIN: Oh no.

2461
02:24:38,707 --> 02:24:43,652
MARISHA: And I just say, red alert, red alert,
think we got a kraken coming.

2462
02:24:43,652 --> 02:24:48,879
Think the weather is calling for a kraken tonight.

2463
02:24:48,879 --> 02:24:53,301
MATT: As you guys hear this, you glance about the
vicinity and watch as suddenly a series of large

2464
02:24:53,301 --> 02:24:57,592
tentacles (whump whump) around this large
outcropping of

2465
02:24:57,773 --> 02:25:01,374
what looks like stone or wood
jutting out of the base of the floor.

2466
02:25:01,374 --> 02:25:04,431
MARISHA: Please tell me you guys found a
lodestone. Did you guys find it? Did you find it?

2467
02:25:04,431 --> 02:25:06,449
LAURA: Did I find it while it was happening?

2468
02:25:06,449 --> 02:25:07,733
MARISHA: Please tell me you found it.

2469
02:25:07,733 --> 02:25:08,690
MATT: You rolled a--

2470
02:25:08,690 --> 02:25:09,371
LAURA: 19.

2471
02:25:09,371 --> 02:25:14,249
MATT: 19? You just barely hit the exterior of it
when this happens. You're like, oh, I found it,

2472
02:25:14,249 --> 02:25:17,201
you look over, see Taryon yell, and then watch
this creature

2473
02:25:17,201 --> 02:25:20,591
suddenly swift down and begin to
crawl over the top.

2474
02:25:20,591 --> 02:25:23,726
MARISHA: Vex, Vex, let's do the Daylight. Red
alert, red alert, Daylight!

2475
02:25:23,726 --> 02:25:26,996
Taryon, dig up the lodestone immediately--

2476
02:25:26,996 --> 02:25:29,091
MATT: I need all of you to make initiative
checks.

2477
02:25:29,091 --> 02:25:30,211
MARISHA: Fuck me! No!

2478
02:25:30,211 --> 02:25:31,013
LAURA: Jeez!

2479
02:25:31,013 --> 02:25:31,704
MARISHA: Fuck!

2480
02:25:31,704 --> 02:25:35,491
TALIESIN: God damn it.

2481
02:25:35,491 --> 02:25:38,414
LAURA: Maybe we can shoot Daylight directly into
his eyeball.

2482
02:25:38,414 --> 02:25:39,239
MARISHA: Natural 20!

2483
02:25:39,239 --> 02:25:40,356
ALL: Woo!

2484
02:25:40,356 --> 02:25:43,163
TRAVIS: Do you really think Daylight's gonna help
at this point?

2485
02:25:43,163 --> 02:25:46,885
LAURA: In his eyes, maybe. He's not used to bright
light.

2486
02:25:46,885 --> 02:25:50,047
TRAVIS: Oh, thank god I have advantage.

2487
02:25:50,047 --> 02:25:51,510
SAM: It would help me and Taliesin see.

2488
02:25:51,510 --> 02:25:52,462
MARISHA: That's true, not used to bright--

2489
02:25:52,462 --> 02:25:55,193
LIAM: Aw, the humans. Aw.

2490
02:25:55,193 --> 02:25:59,284
MARISHA: Just like, fwoomp, towards him. Over him,
away from him.

2491
02:25:59,284 --> 02:26:00,363
MATT: All right. So.

2492
02:26:00,363 --> 02:26:01,939
LAURA: Or directly at him.

2493
02:26:01,939 --> 02:26:02,773
MARISHA: Towards him, yeah.

2494
02:26:02,773 --> 02:26:03,857
MATT: 25 to 20.

2495
02:26:03,857 --> 02:26:04,966
SAM: (whispers) I could've used Luck.

2496
02:26:04,966 --> 02:26:05,644
LIAM: 24.

2497
02:26:05,644 --> 02:26:06,378
MATT: 24.

2498
02:26:06,378 --> 02:26:07,032
MARISHA: 22.

2499
02:26:07,032 --> 02:26:08,094
TALIESIN: Yeah, you could've used Luck.

2500
02:26:08,094 --> 02:26:08,744
MATT: 22, nice.

2501
02:26:08,744 --> 02:26:09,870
SAM: Forgot about it.

2502
02:26:09,870 --> 02:26:10,505
TALIESIN: 17.

2503
02:26:10,505 --> 02:26:12,217
LAURA: 19.

2504
02:26:12,217 --> 02:26:17,879
MARISHA: Ah. Worked out yesterday. Ouch.

2505
02:26:17,884 --> 02:26:19,935
MATT: All right, 15?

2506
02:26:19,935 --> 02:26:20,903
SAM: 13.

2507
02:26:20,903 --> 02:26:22,601
MATT: 13.

2508
02:26:22,601 --> 02:26:24,226
TRAVIS: 14 for Groggy Grog.

2509
02:26:24,226 --> 02:26:27,496
LAURA: The Groggy-poo.

2510
02:26:27,496 --> 02:26:31,016
SAM: Liam, how do you remember when to use Luck?

2511
02:26:31,016 --> 02:26:35,052
LIAM: Uh, when shit is exploding in your face?

2512
02:26:35,052 --> 02:26:36,538
SAM: Yeah, well, I forgot.

2513
02:26:36,538 --> 02:26:38,768
ALL: Ohh.

2514
02:26:38,768 --> 02:26:42,671
MATT: As you watch this entity suddenly emerge
from the top, there--

2515
02:26:42,671 --> 02:26:43,958
ALL: No!

2516
02:26:43,958 --> 02:26:45,556
TALIESIN: Not cool.

2517
02:26:45,556 --> 02:26:47,577
LAURA: Whoa, he's really pretty in that light,
though.

2518
02:26:47,577 --> 02:26:48,981
TALIESIN: Yeah, he is very pretty.

2519
02:26:48,981 --> 02:26:49,967
MATT: Enjoy it.

2520
02:26:49,967 --> 02:26:53,293
MARISHA: He's like a delightful Creole dish.

2521
02:26:53,293 --> 02:26:55,842
LIAM: The inside of his mouth is so pretty
(muffled yelling).

2522
02:26:55,842 --> 02:26:59,023
MATT: So. Top of the round. Vax, you're up.

2523
02:26:59,023 --> 02:26:59,939
LIAM: Jeepers creepers.

2524
02:26:59,939 --> 02:27:04,350
MATT: You hear this noise through, and Keyleth
giving the warning. As you glance over and see the

2525
02:27:04,350 --> 02:27:08,581
top of this structure, the dark shadow of the
kraken pull its way over the top.

2526
02:27:08,581 --> 02:27:09,490
MARISHA: Don't hurt it!

2527
02:27:09,490 --> 02:27:14,715
MATT: You see this gleaming yellow eye on the one
side that's near you, and what looks to be three,

2528
02:27:14,715 --> 02:27:19,163
five, seven or more tentacles begin to curl over
and pull it over the top,

2529
02:27:19,163 --> 02:27:21,901
making its way towards your friends. 
What are you doing?

2530
02:27:21,901 --> 02:27:31,507
LIAM: I'm clicking the boots of haste. And I am
casting Bless on myself, on Keyleth, and on Grog.

2531
02:27:31,507 --> 02:27:32,707
MATT: Okay, what's the distance on that?

2532
02:27:32,707 --> 02:27:33,554
LIAM: 30 feet.

2533
02:27:33,554 --> 02:27:37,466
MATT: 30 feet? Yeah, Grog is just in range.

2534
02:27:37,466 --> 02:27:38,526
LIAM: You are blessed.

2535
02:27:38,526 --> 02:27:39,651
TRAVIS: What's that mean?

2536
02:27:39,651 --> 02:27:43,097
LIAM: It means on attacks or on saving throws, you
can roll a d4 and add that

2537
02:27:43,097 --> 02:27:45,030
for a minute, for the whole battle, basically.

2538
02:27:45,030 --> 02:27:45,840
TRAVIS: Nice!

2539
02:27:45,840 --> 02:27:47,502
MATT: It is a concentration spell.

2540
02:27:47,502 --> 02:27:48,110
LIAM: Yeah.

2541
02:27:48,110 --> 02:27:49,081
MATT: Okay.

2542
02:27:49,081 --> 02:27:50,072
TRAVIS: Great, thank you.

2543
02:27:50,072 --> 02:27:52,501
MATT: So that's your-- you used the Haste, you
have your action.

2544
02:27:52,501 --> 02:27:55,087
What are you gonna do for your movement?

2545
02:27:55,087 --> 02:28:02,395
LIAM: I'm going to-- I'm 45 stealth, I'm going to
back away to behind those giant shells.

2546
02:28:02,395 --> 02:28:03,389
MATT: Over here?

2547
02:28:03,389 --> 02:28:05,040
MARISHA: Someone find the third fucking
lodestone.

2548
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:09,251
MATT: Your speed is 60 right now, so you can move
30 feet hasted underwater, swimming.

2549
02:28:09,251 --> 02:28:15,935
LIAM: Mm-hm. So I'm gonna swim over that way. And
I'm hasted, so

2550
02:28:15,935 --> 02:28:18,526
action, action, I should have a bonus action, 
yeah?

2551
02:28:18,526 --> 02:28:19,339
MATT: Yeah.

2552
02:28:19,339 --> 02:28:21,345
LIAM: So I'll hide, if I'm not hidden already.

2553
02:28:21,345 --> 02:28:22,890
MATT: Yeah, you can do that. Roll a stealth
check.

2554
02:28:22,890 --> 02:28:25,981
LIAM: Good, 35.

2555
02:28:25,981 --> 02:28:27,553
LAURA: We would've been a bunch of whales slamming
into shit.

2556
02:28:27,553 --> 02:28:33,580
MATT: Okay, cool. Yeah. All right, so. That brings
us to Keyleth.

2557
02:28:33,580 --> 02:28:36,716
MARISHA: How far away am I from Vex?

2558
02:28:36,716 --> 02:28:43,343
MATT: From Vex? You're not sure. You'd probably be
somewhere in the neighborhood of 35, 40 feet.

2559
02:28:43,343 --> 02:28:45,964
MARISHA: Let me move towards-- I say, Vex!

2560
02:28:45,964 --> 02:28:48,523
MATT: You've used Alter Self on yourself?

2561
02:28:48,523 --> 02:28:49,248
MARISHA: Huh?

2562
02:28:49,248 --> 02:28:52,254
MATT: You've altered yourself, right, to swim
fine?

2563
02:28:52,254 --> 02:28:56,264
MARISHA: Yeah. I can do that at will.

2564
02:28:56,264 --> 02:28:57,737
MATT: I know. So how many feet do you want to
move?

2565
02:28:57,737 --> 02:29:00,861
MARISHA: Enough to see Vex. Vex?

2566
02:29:00,861 --> 02:29:05,094
MATT: She's just on the other side of the rock,
and as you say that, you look up, and notice the

2567
02:29:05,094 --> 02:29:10,347
creature, and you see Vex's head just barely poke
over this stone barrier.

2568
02:29:10,347 --> 02:29:12,870
LAURA: I'm going--

2569
02:29:12,870 --> 02:29:22,495
MARISHA: Daylight arrow! Now! And I prep my
Daylight spell for whenever she draws her arrow.

2570
02:29:22,495 --> 02:29:26,946
And I wait for as soon as I see the tip of her
arrow to go.

2571
02:29:26,946 --> 02:29:30,160
MATT: Okay. So you're holding your casting action
until you see her arrow go.

2572
02:29:30,160 --> 02:29:37,106
MARISHA: And then I say, dear god, please, Taryon,
find the other lodestone. Don't kill the kraken!

2573
02:29:37,106 --> 02:29:38,721
SAM: I didn't hear any of that.

2574
02:29:38,721 --> 02:29:40,711
MATT: Because he does not have an earpiece.

2575
02:29:40,711 --> 02:29:41,506
MARISHA: Fuck!

2576
02:29:41,506 --> 02:29:42,712
(all laugh)

2577
02:29:42,712 --> 02:29:44,178
MARISHA: Fuck!

2578
02:29:44,178 --> 02:29:46,068
LIAM: That loud, though?

2579
02:29:46,068 --> 02:29:48,808
MATT: But you do hear it, because you're
underwater, and because of the--

2580
02:29:48,808 --> 02:29:50,133
MARISHA: These things!

2581
02:29:50,133 --> 02:29:55,488
MATT: You do hear it. It's a little garbled, but
you pick up the essence of what she's saying.

2582
02:29:55,488 --> 02:30:02,460
MARISHA: (garbled) Use the compass. Lodestone.

2583
02:30:02,460 --> 02:30:03,835
MATT: All right, Keyleth, you're holding your
action.

2584
02:30:03,835 --> 02:30:05,154
TALIESIN: Coldstone? That's a great idea!

2585
02:30:05,154 --> 02:30:10,832
MARISHA: (garbled) Coldstone Creamery. Go for the
raspberry cheesecake.

2586
02:30:10,832 --> 02:30:16,469
MATT: Okay, as the kraken pulls its way over, you
watch as its yellow eye all of a sudden glows blue.

2587
02:30:16,469 --> 02:30:17,186
LAURA: Oh no.

2588
02:30:17,186 --> 02:30:18,957
MATT: And you watch as the edge of its tentacles
begin to

2589
02:30:18,957 --> 02:30:21,541
(charging noise) give off this luminescent blue 
glow.

2590
02:30:21,541 --> 02:30:22,456
MARISHA: No.

2591
02:30:22,456 --> 02:30:27,327
MATT: And suddenly this (electricity noise) burst
of electrical energy shoots forth from it and

2592
02:30:27,327 --> 02:30:30,755
completely encompasses the surrounding-- all
creatures within

2593
02:30:30,755 --> 02:30:34,110
120 feet have to make a constitution saving 
throw. All of you.

2594
02:30:34,110 --> 02:30:35,172
LIAM: d4, d4.

2595
02:30:35,172 --> 02:30:35,995
TRAVIS: Yes, thank you.

2596
02:30:35,995 --> 02:30:37,706
MARISHA: Plus a d4, plus a d4.

2597
02:30:37,706 --> 02:30:42,755
TALIESIN: I don't get any-- my cloak doesn't get
any bonus against this, does it?

2598
02:30:42,755 --> 02:30:43,540
MATT: No.

2599
02:30:43,540 --> 02:30:46,065
MARISHA: Using the people-killer-- not bad. Not
bad, people-killer.

2600
02:30:46,065 --> 02:30:47,871
MATT: This is a lair action for the kraken.

2601
02:30:47,871 --> 02:30:48,771
LAURA: Oh, god.

2602
02:30:48,771 --> 02:30:52,778
TRAVIS: A lair action for the kraken? 'Cause we're
in its fucking fish-tank.

2603
02:30:52,778 --> 02:30:54,457
MATT: It's made this its lair for the past-- for a
number of years.

2604
02:30:54,457 --> 02:30:55,876
TRAVIS: Fuck you, Costco.

2605
02:30:55,876 --> 02:30:57,560
LIAM: (laughs)

2606
02:30:57,560 --> 02:30:58,716
TRAVIS: I meant Petco.

2607
02:30:58,716 --> 02:31:02,453
LAURA: (laughs) "I meant Petco".

2608
02:31:02,453 --> 02:31:03,425
TALIESIN: That's better!

2609
02:31:03,425 --> 02:31:04,912
LIAM: Oh, yes!

2610
02:31:04,912 --> 02:31:05,997
LAURA: Use Luck, Tary.

2611
02:31:05,997 --> 02:31:06,745
SAM: I did!

2612
02:31:06,745 --> 02:31:07,818
LAURA: (laughs)

2613
02:31:07,818 --> 02:31:08,655
LIAM: I did too!

2614
02:31:08,655 --> 02:31:09,983
(all laugh)

2615
02:31:09,983 --> 02:31:12,497
SAM: And grateful for it.

2616
02:31:12,497 --> 02:31:13,395
MATT: All right, so-

2617
02:31:13,395 --> 02:31:14,376
SAM: 26.

2618
02:31:14,376 --> 02:31:22,742
MATT: Okay, so you take eight points of lightning
damage. Percy.

2619
02:31:22,742 --> 02:31:23,738
TALIESIN: 23.

2620
02:31:23,738 --> 02:31:25,540
MATT: 23, eight points of lightning damage.
Keyleth.

2621
02:31:25,540 --> 02:31:26,566
MARISHA: 19.

2622
02:31:26,566 --> 02:31:31,409
MATT: You take 19 points of lightning damage.

2623
02:31:31,409 --> 02:31:32,581
MARISHA: 19.

2624
02:31:32,581 --> 02:31:36,844
LIAM: 22, plus I'm set to lightning with the
Deathwalker's Ward.

2625
02:31:36,844 --> 02:31:41,392
MATT: 19 halved to eight points of lightning
damage-- oh wait, actually--

2626
02:31:41,392 --> 02:31:43,391
LIAM: Halved twice, I should be quarter, right? If
I made the save?

2627
02:31:43,391 --> 02:31:44,232
MATT: Oh, no you didn't make it.

2628
02:31:44,232 --> 02:31:45,690
LIAM: Oh I didn't make it? 22 didn't make it? Oh.

2629
02:31:45,690 --> 02:31:46,922
MATT: No, I'm sorry it was--

2630
02:31:46,922 --> 02:31:48,273
MARISHA: I said 19.

2631
02:31:48,273 --> 02:31:48,985
MATT: Right--

2632
02:31:48,985 --> 02:31:50,039
MARISHA: And that took--

2633
02:31:50,039 --> 02:31:51,253
LAURA: 18 damage.

2634
02:31:51,253 --> 02:32:00,800
MATT: I apologize, it was nine, nine, and 18
damage. So nine, nine, 18, 18.

2635
02:32:00,800 --> 02:32:05,152
LAURA: I already forgot what I rolled, 'cause
everybody's talking numbers. 14!

2636
02:32:05,152 --> 02:32:06,469
MATT: 18 points of lightning damage.

2637
02:32:06,469 --> 02:32:07,340
LAURA: You got it!

2638
02:32:07,340 --> 02:32:08,313
MATT: Trinket?

2639
02:32:08,313 --> 02:32:12,891
LAURA: Oh, shit... He doesn't make it.

2640
02:32:12,891 --> 02:32:14,662
MARISHA and TALIESIN: (imitating Oprah) You take
18 points of lightning damage!

2641
02:32:14,662 --> 02:32:15,889
MATT: 18 points of lightning damage. Grog.

2642
02:32:15,889 --> 02:32:18,135
TRAVIS: With my #blessed, 27.

2643
02:32:18,135 --> 02:32:19,640
MATT: You take eight points of lightning damage.

2644
02:32:19,640 --> 02:32:21,204
MARISHA: (laughs) "#blessed"

2645
02:32:21,204 --> 02:32:22,751
MATT: Or nine-- sorry, nine.

2646
02:32:22,751 --> 02:32:23,502
TRAVIS: Nine?

2647
02:32:23,502 --> 02:32:24,306
MATT: Nine.

2648
02:32:24,306 --> 02:32:25,706
LIAM: #Bless bless bless.

2649
02:32:25,706 --> 02:32:26,837
TRAVIS: Bless bless.

2650
02:32:26,837 --> 02:32:29,691
MATT: All righty. Vex, you're up. As you kinda
reel from the sudden electrical shock that pulses

2651
02:32:29,691 --> 02:32:32,060
out in the vicinity, what are you doing?

2652
02:32:32,060 --> 02:32:36,243
LAURA: The Alter Self coin, does that take an
action or is that--

2653
02:32:36,243 --> 02:32:38,190
MATT: Yes, it's to cast the spell on yourself.

2654
02:32:38,190 --> 02:32:42,903
LAURA: Fuck, okay. Then I'm going to start with
pulling out the arrow and doing what Keyleth and I

2655
02:32:42,903 --> 02:32:48,500
talked about. Hey! I'm pulling out my arrow.

2656
02:32:48,500 --> 02:32:50,193
MARISHA: Daylight on the tip of that arrow.

2657
02:32:50,193 --> 02:32:51,085
LIAM: Finger guns.

2658
02:32:51,085 --> 02:32:52,149
LAURA: And I'm gonna shoot it--

2659
02:32:52,149 --> 02:32:53,044
MATT: And you see it just slowly arc--

2660
02:32:53,044 --> 02:32:54,047
MARISHA: Pew, pew, pew.

2661
02:32:54,047 --> 02:32:57,766
LAURA: As close as I can to the Kraken's head and
just, like, past him.

2662
02:32:57,766 --> 02:33:02,496
I want it to go by the eyeball.

2663
02:33:02,496 --> 02:33:05,684
MATT: Okay, let me see here, Daylight.

2664
02:33:05,684 --> 02:33:08,777
TRAVIS: You're throwing a meatball past a lion
that's stalking you.

2665
02:33:08,777 --> 02:33:10,562
LAURA: I mean, if I can get it in its head--

2666
02:33:10,562 --> 02:33:11,556
TALIESIN: It's a really good meatball.

2667
02:33:11,556 --> 02:33:12,487
SAM: Hit it!

2668
02:33:12,487 --> 02:33:14,303
LAURA: If I can hit it in its head, that's cool,
but--

2669
02:33:14,303 --> 02:33:15,500
MARISHA: It's a Hail Mary pass.

2670
02:33:15,500 --> 02:33:17,179
TRAVIS: It'll be like, "Yeah, fuck these treats. I
want that meatball."

2671
02:33:17,179 --> 02:33:18,174
MATT: Is this Light or Daylight?

2672
02:33:18,174 --> 02:33:18,817
MARISHA: Daylight.

2673
02:33:18,817 --> 02:33:20,804
MATT: 'Cause Daylight you just choose a sphere for
it to happen.

2674
02:33:20,804 --> 02:33:22,088
TRAVIS: (watch talking)

2675
02:33:22,088 --> 02:33:26,653
MARISHA: I've totally cast Daylight on an object
before.

2676
02:33:26,653 --> 02:33:27,975
SAM and MATT: You don't need to.

2677
02:33:27,975 --> 02:33:30,544
MATT: But we'll say for the purposes of this--

2678
02:33:30,544 --> 02:33:31,692
MARISHA: But I can do that, right?

2679
02:33:31,692 --> 02:33:32,594
MATT: Sure.

2680
02:33:32,594 --> 02:33:34,159
MARISHA: 'Cause I did that with Grog and his bull
helmet.

2681
02:33:34,159 --> 02:33:35,746
TALIESIN: So that way it'll stay lit over there.

2682
02:33:35,746 --> 02:33:36,539
MARISHA: Over on the arrow.

2683
02:33:36,539 --> 02:33:37,841
TRAVIS: (watch talking)

2684
02:33:37,841 --> 02:33:38,737
MATT: Sure.

2685
02:33:38,737 --> 02:33:39,537
MARISHA: Like a flare--

2686
02:33:39,537 --> 02:33:40,701
LAURA: What is happening to your watch?

2687
02:33:40,701 --> 02:33:41,504
MATT: Okay, we'll go with that.

2688
02:33:41,504 --> 02:33:42,876
MARISHA: I don't know if that's allowed, but I
know we've done that in the past.

2689
02:33:42,876 --> 02:33:44,095
TRAVIS: (watch talking)

2690
02:33:44,095 --> 02:33:44,946
MATT: Oh, it happened, it happened. So as you hit
that--

2691
02:33:44,946 --> 02:33:46,446
TRAVIS: (watch says: "Zero miles")

2692
02:33:46,446 --> 02:33:47,357
SAM: What is going on?

2693
02:33:47,357 --> 02:33:49,397
LAURA: His watch is telling him he's working out.

2694
02:33:49,397 --> 02:33:51,446
MATT: You're not working out.

2695
02:33:51,446 --> 02:33:53,816
TRAVIS: Wow, Siri's fucking drunk right now.

2696
02:33:53,816 --> 02:33:55,003
(all laugh)

2697
02:33:55,003 --> 02:33:57,887
MATT: I don't know, man, kraken just showed up.
That sounds like a workout to me.

2698
02:33:57,887 --> 02:33:59,071
TRAVIS: "Elevated heart rate."

2699
02:33:59,071 --> 02:33:59,978
LAURA: Oh, I know! It said--

2700
02:33:59,978 --> 02:34:01,187
TRAVIS: "Please, take a moment to breathe."

2701
02:34:01,187 --> 02:34:03,098
(all laugh)

2702
02:34:03,098 --> 02:34:06,452
MATT: Well, on that note. Okay, so you focus as
she draws the arrow and pulls with intent in the

2703
02:34:06,452 --> 02:34:10,679
back of the bow. As you do, you focus and you
watch as, Vex, you aim and then close your eyes as

2704
02:34:10,679 --> 02:34:17,051
you see this spark of energy curl off the front of
the arrow. You see bright, nature-based daylight

2705
02:34:17,051 --> 02:34:19,497
burst out of the arrow as you release it. Go ahead
and

2706
02:34:19,497 --> 02:34:23,187
make an attack against the kraken with 
disadvantage, please.

2707
02:34:23,187 --> 02:34:24,466
LAURA: Okay.

2708
02:34:24,466 --> 02:34:25,411
MARISHA: Come on.

2709
02:34:25,411 --> 02:34:26,616
LAURA: Come on!

2710
02:34:26,616 --> 02:34:28,015
LAURA and MARISHA: Come on!

2711
02:34:28,015 --> 02:34:29,885
LAURA: Come on, come on.

2712
02:34:29,885 --> 02:34:31,582
MATT: No, you were right, if you choose a point
with an object you're holding, and one that isn't

2713
02:34:31,582 --> 02:34:34,389
being worn, the light shines from the object. You
were correct.

2714
02:34:34,389 --> 02:34:35,541
LAURA: 26.

2715
02:34:35,541 --> 02:34:40,146
MATT: 26, that hits! Go ahead and roll damage.

2716
02:34:40,146 --> 02:34:43,210
LAURA: (high-pitched) Okay. Well, all right!

2717
02:34:43,210 --> 02:34:45,942
LIAM: Totally in-character.

2718
02:34:45,942 --> 02:34:50,803
LAURA: (deep voice) 12 plus (normal voice) one
lightning damage.

2719
02:34:50,803 --> 02:34:53,409
MATT: All right, so 13.

2720
02:34:53,409 --> 02:34:58,593
LAURA: This is not a Sneak Attack and I obviously
can't have done Hunter's Mark.

2721
02:34:58,593 --> 02:35:05,330
MATT: Right, so the arrow sinks into the underside
of the kraken's dark form. You're just barely

2722
02:35:05,330 --> 02:35:10,851
making out bits of its shape. As the light hits,
you can see now, close to it looks like ten

2723
02:35:10,851 --> 02:35:15,813
various tentacles curling and finding its way over
the top of this structure.

2724
02:35:15,813 --> 02:35:19,544
It slams into the side,
and daylight brightly sprays out from under it.

2725
02:35:19,544 --> 02:35:21,649
LAURA: I want it to be by its eye.

2726
02:35:21,649 --> 02:35:26,310
MATT: By the way, because daylight-- no, it lasts
for an hour. So you watch as this light is now

2727
02:35:26,310 --> 02:35:32,343
billowing from underneath the creature. You can
watch as its pupil adjusts to the light. It does

2728
02:35:32,343 --> 02:35:36,653
not appear to be blinded or have any issue with
the daylight, however, it is now a beacon, and the

2729
02:35:36,653 --> 02:35:43,049
arrow now partially jammed into its side, you have
a very clear idea and a bright view of the

2730
02:35:43,049 --> 02:35:46,744
battlefield around it as this kraken is now
emitting light in its vicinity.

2731
02:35:46,744 --> 02:35:48,182
MARISHA: Sure.

2732
02:35:48,182 --> 02:35:50,194
LAURA: Well, now there's shadows.

2733
02:35:50,194 --> 02:35:52,430
TRAVIS: And a giant megalodon comes and eats it.

2734
02:35:52,430 --> 02:35:53,561
(all laugh)

2735
02:35:53,561 --> 02:35:54,508
LAURA: Ooh, that'd be great.

2736
02:35:54,508 --> 02:35:55,746
MATT: So that's your first attack.

2737
02:35:55,746 --> 02:36:01,006
LAURA: Oh, yeah. I can't do a spell for my second?
I can't do Alter Self on my second?

2738
02:36:01,006 --> 02:36:02,595
MATT: No, you've already attacked once, that was
part of the attack action.

2739
02:36:02,595 --> 02:36:05,586
LAURA: I was just checking. Okay, do I still get
disadvantage if I attack it again?

2740
02:36:05,586 --> 02:36:06,417
MATT: Yep.

2741
02:36:06,417 --> 02:36:07,542
LAURA: Okay, I'm gonna attack it again.

2742
02:36:07,542 --> 02:36:10,196
MATT: It's not about aim, it's about the actual--
the water resistance.

2743
02:36:10,196 --> 02:36:12,272
LAURA: Okay, I'm gonna attack it again.

2744
02:36:12,272 --> 02:36:15,949
MATT: Go for it.

2745
02:36:15,949 --> 02:36:17,499
LAURA: What's 15 plus seven?

2746
02:36:17,499 --> 02:36:18,493
TRAVIS: 22.

2747
02:36:18,493 --> 02:36:19,371
LAURA: 22.

2748
02:36:19,371 --> 02:36:26,036
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2749
02:36:26,036 --> 02:36:31,664
LAURA: 12 plus... just one damn lightning damage.

2750
02:36:31,664 --> 02:36:32,489
MATT: Okay.

2751
02:36:32,489 --> 02:36:33,571
TRAVIS: One damn.

2752
02:36:33,571 --> 02:36:35,732
LAURA: (Southern accent) One damn lightning damage
there.

2753
02:36:35,732 --> 02:36:38,707
MATT: You watch as the spark of energy from the
arrow hits it the second time, the daylight

2754
02:36:38,707 --> 02:36:42,834
obstructing your view, and the energy bursts
around it. The lightning damage you're used to

2755
02:36:42,834 --> 02:36:47,731
seeing from any creature it impacts, the lightning
seems to just hit its blubbery hide and vanish.

2756
02:36:47,731 --> 02:36:51,513
LAURA: Right, 'cause lightning-- it just did
lightning. Obviously it's immune to lightning.

2757
02:36:51,513 --> 02:37:00,115
Right. And I'm gonna use my motion to back the
fuck off and try to get behind that rock

2758
02:37:00,115 --> 02:37:06,876
outcropping. Laser pointer. Okay, yeah, sure. Just
on the other side of it.

2759
02:37:06,876 --> 02:37:08,302
MATT: That's as far as you can get.

2760
02:37:08,302 --> 02:37:09,004
LAURA: Okay, cool.

2761
02:37:09,004 --> 02:37:12,445
MATT: Because you don't have your Alter Self form
yet. You're like (swimming noises).

2762
02:37:12,445 --> 02:37:14,679
You're slowly swimming through this water, 
sluggishly.

2763
02:37:14,679 --> 02:37:15,372
LAURA: Okay.

2764
02:37:15,372 --> 02:37:17,539
MATT: As far as you get Trinket, you want to give
Trinket any sort of movement on this?

2765
02:37:17,539 --> 02:37:20,455
LAURA: Yeah, can he back up behind that pillar?

2766
02:37:20,455 --> 02:37:21,502
MATT: Right here?

2767
02:37:21,502 --> 02:37:22,310
LAURA: Yeah.

2768
02:37:22,310 --> 02:37:28,796
MATT: Yeah, Trinket moves up and guards himself
behind the side. All right. Percival.

2769
02:37:28,796 --> 02:37:35,704
TALIESIN: I'm gonna use my bonus action to cast
Hex on the kraken. I'm gonna Hex the kraken.

2770
02:37:35,704 --> 02:37:37,562
MATT: By the way, Vax, did you make--

2771
02:37:37,562 --> 02:37:39,061
LAURA: Oh, did I get a bonus action, I guess I
could've--

2772
02:37:39,061 --> 02:37:40,398
MARISHA: Don't kill it, don't kill it.

2773
02:37:40,398 --> 02:37:41,700
TALIESIN: No, I just want to know where it is.

2774
02:37:41,700 --> 02:37:43,811
MATT: What do you want to do for your bonus
action?

2775
02:37:43,811 --> 02:37:44,941
TALIESIN: There's nothing I can do to it.

2776
02:37:44,941 --> 02:37:46,415
LAURA: Can I hide for my bonus action as rogue?

2777
02:37:46,415 --> 02:37:47,731
MATT: You can.

2778
02:37:47,731 --> 02:37:48,526
LAURA: Yeah, I'll do that.

2779
02:37:48,526 --> 02:37:50,978
TALIESIN: I literally have only one power, and
that's to electrocute it, which does nothing.

2780
02:37:50,978 --> 02:37:53,390
MARISHA: These violet candies are delicious.

2781
02:37:53,390 --> 02:37:55,491
TALIESIN: Really good. They're really good and
they're a problem.

2782
02:37:55,491 --> 02:37:57,243
MARISHA: Just delicious.

2783
02:37:57,243 --> 02:38:00,800
TALIESIN: I'm going to dig the lodestone out of
the dirt.

2784
02:38:00,800 --> 02:38:01,841
MATT: Okay.

2785
02:38:01,841 --> 02:38:02,947
MARISHA: Don't worry about it.

2786
02:38:02,947 --> 02:38:08,517
TALIESIN: I'm gonna spend my turn keeping an eye
on the thing I just Hexed so I know where it is.

2787
02:38:08,517 --> 02:38:14,564
MATT: Okay. You go ahead and spend your entire
turn pulling the lodestone out,

2788
02:38:14,564 --> 02:38:16,205
and you're now holding it in your hands.

2789
02:38:16,205 --> 02:38:17,991
TALIESIN: And I'm also turning to Tary and going,

2790
02:38:17,991 --> 02:38:20,878
(whispers) find the next one, we've gotta get out 
of here.

2791
02:38:20,878 --> 02:38:22,119
SAM: Okay.

2792
02:38:22,119 --> 02:38:25,731
MATT: Okay. So that's your action. Do you want to
move at all?

2793
02:38:25,731 --> 02:38:30,576
TALIESIN: Yeah, once I've got the lodestone, I
wanna-- well, I don't have the bag.

2794
02:38:30,576 --> 02:38:32,449
LAURA: You're next to Tary, though, you can put it
in his.

2795
02:38:32,449 --> 02:38:33,972
TALIESIN: I'm gonna put it in Tary's bag.

2796
02:38:33,972 --> 02:38:37,551
MATT: Okay, so you move over and you're able to go
ahead and put it.

2797
02:38:37,551 --> 02:38:39,277
TALIESIN: And I'm gonna try and see if I can get
some cover,

2798
02:38:39,277 --> 02:38:44,407
as far away from that thing as possible. 
Whatever I can do.

2799
02:38:44,407 --> 02:38:48,408
MATT: Five, ten. You're not able really to get any
cover, unfortunately, because the water's like

2800
02:38:48,408 --> 02:38:52,692
(swimming noises), you're swimming through after
putting it inside there, and you move along, you

2801
02:38:52,692 --> 02:38:55,556
used your action to pull it up, kinda put it
inside there.

2802
02:38:55,556 --> 02:38:58,585
As the rest of the turn you just
swim past, that's as far as you can get.

2803
02:38:58,585 --> 02:38:59,534
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2804
02:38:59,534 --> 02:39:00,464
MATT: All right. That ends your turn.

2805
02:39:00,464 --> 02:39:01,699
TALESIN: Oh, god.

2806
02:39:01,699 --> 02:39:08,447
MATT: All right. Now it's the kraken's turn. Let's
see. Swim speed of 60 feet.

2807
02:39:08,447 --> 02:39:09,535
TALIESIN: Fuck you.

2808
02:39:09,535 --> 02:39:24,117
MATT: It coasts around, this direction. We'll say
it gets over in this side here, perspective-wise.

2809
02:39:24,117 --> 02:39:27,402
Vex, what'd you roll for your stealth again? It
was--

2810
02:39:27,402 --> 02:39:29,156
LAURA: I didn't roll after I said I hid.

2811
02:39:29,156 --> 02:39:31,110
MATT: For your hide, because you're gonna hide for
your bonus action,

2812
02:39:31,110 --> 02:39:33,078
so go ahead and make your hide check.

2813
02:39:33,078 --> 02:39:33,750
LAURA: Okay.

2814
02:39:33,750 --> 02:39:36,353
MATT: Stealth check.

2815
02:39:36,353 --> 02:39:38,907
LAURA: Oh, that's good, that's good, 35.

2816
02:39:38,907 --> 02:39:39,638
LIAM: Rogue!

2817
02:39:39,638 --> 02:39:40,538
SAM: 35!

2818
02:39:40,538 --> 02:39:45,997
MATT: Okay. By the way, Vax, I meant to ask: go
ahead and make a concentration check.

2819
02:39:45,997 --> 02:39:49,045
So it's a constitution saving throw.

2820
02:39:49,045 --> 02:39:52,593
LIAM: Jeebus. I'm gonna use Luck. All right. 15.

2821
02:39:52,593 --> 02:39:54,182
MATT: 15. Okay, you maintain concentration on
the--

2822
02:39:54,182 --> 02:39:55,023
LIAM: Shite.

2823
02:39:55,023 --> 02:40:00,341
MATT: -- Bless to you guys, so you still have
that. All righty.

2824
02:40:00,341 --> 02:40:01,818
TALIESIN: I'm not happy with any of this.

2825
02:40:01,818 --> 02:40:03,643
MATT: So, the kraken is now--

2826
02:40:03,643 --> 02:40:04,928
MARISHA: Don't kill it, don't kill it, don't kill
it.

2827
02:40:04,928 --> 02:40:05,947
TALIESIN: How can I?

2828
02:40:05,947 --> 02:40:09,761
MATT: Its tentacles begin to whip outward. It's
going to make one strike against Vex--

2829
02:40:09,761 --> 02:40:10,478
LAURA: Aw, he saw me?

2830
02:40:10,478 --> 02:40:15,639
MATT: -- one strike against Tary, and one strike
against Grog!

2831
02:40:15,639 --> 02:40:16,436
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2832
02:40:16,436 --> 02:40:17,731
MATT: 'Cause why not?

2833
02:40:17,731 --> 02:40:22,712
LAURA: 35 is not good enough to hide from him!

2834
02:40:22,712 --> 02:40:28,555
MATT: Wait. That's right, you're hidden, so it
does not. It's Tary, Percival, and Grog.

2835
02:40:28,555 --> 02:40:29,289
LAURA: Oh, sorry.

2836
02:40:29,289 --> 02:40:30,068
TALIESIN: You did this to me.

2837
02:40:30,068 --> 02:40:31,054
LAURA: I'm sorry, that's--

2838
02:40:31,054 --> 02:40:32,683
MATT: That is a total of 32 against Tary.

2839
02:40:32,683 --> 02:40:35,205
SAM: Sure! Oh, yeah that hits. Yeah, of course.

2840
02:40:35,205 --> 02:40:37,241
MATT: Percy, that is 23?

2841
02:40:37,241 --> 02:40:38,256
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that hits.

2842
02:40:38,256 --> 02:40:44,133
MATT: And Grog, that is 23 again.

2843
02:40:44,133 --> 02:40:45,464
TRAVIS: It sure hits.

2844
02:40:45,464 --> 02:40:48,438
TALIESIN: Not speaking as Percy, this is
legitimately nightmare fuel right now.

2845
02:40:48,438 --> 02:40:50,341
I'm not sleeping tonight.

2846
02:40:50,341 --> 02:40:51,013
MATT: All right.

2847
02:40:51,013 --> 02:40:51,850
TRAVIS: You got a problem with--

2848
02:40:51,850 --> 02:40:52,632
MARISHA: You hate fish!

2849
02:40:52,632 --> 02:40:53,390
TALIESIN: I do, I have a--

2850
02:40:53,390 --> 02:40:54,223
LAURA: Oh, that's right, you hate fish!

2851
02:40:54,223 --> 02:40:55,399
TALIESIN: Shh! Don't tell the internet, they'll
find--

2852
02:40:55,399 --> 02:40:56,818
MARISHA: I'm so sorry, you're so right!

2853
02:40:56,818 --> 02:40:57,797
TRAVIS: Do it. Full blast.

2854
02:40:57,797 --> 02:40:58,941
SAM: Do not send him packages of fish.

2855
02:40:58,941 --> 02:40:59,715
MARISHA: Holy shit.

2856
02:40:59,715 --> 02:41:01,095
MATT: Taryon, you take 16 bludgeoning damage.

2857
02:41:01,095 --> 02:41:02,517
LIAM: Trinket kraken. Trinket kraken.

2858
02:41:02,517 --> 02:41:06,833
MATT: Percival, you take 20 bludgeoning damage.

2859
02:41:06,833 --> 02:41:07,966
MARISHA: Yeah.

2860
02:41:07,966 --> 02:41:08,816
TALIESIN: Okay.

2861
02:41:08,816 --> 02:41:11,472
MATT: Grog, you take 19 bludgeoning damage.

2862
02:41:11,472 --> 02:41:12,363
TRAVIS: Cool.

2863
02:41:12,363 --> 02:41:17,357
MATT: And all three of you are grappled. The
tentacle wraps around you and holds you in place.

2864
02:41:17,357 --> 02:41:19,849
Your movement is zero currently until you try and
break free.

2865
02:41:19,849 --> 02:41:20,533
LIAM: Oh my gosh.

2866
02:41:20,533 --> 02:41:21,367
LAURA: Oh god.

2867
02:41:21,367 --> 02:41:22,303
TALIESIN: Oh no.

2868
02:41:22,303 --> 02:41:25,841
TRAVIS: It's just trying to get a feel for the
friends that are in its space.

2869
02:41:25,841 --> 02:41:27,254
LAURA: Oh god, oh god.

2870
02:41:27,254 --> 02:41:31,256
MATT: All right. That ends the kraken's turn as it
goes ahead

2871
02:41:31,256 --> 02:41:34,405
and grapples three of your allies in the process. 
Grog, it's your turn.

2872
02:41:34,405 --> 02:41:35,547
MARISHA: That's not cool. At all.

2873
02:41:35,547 --> 02:41:36,362
TRAVIS: It's my turn?

2874
02:41:36,362 --> 02:41:37,431
MATT: Yes, it is.

2875
02:41:37,431 --> 02:41:38,694
TALIESIN: It can regrow tentacles.

2876
02:41:38,694 --> 02:41:40,309
TRAVIS: I would like to watery rage.

2877
02:41:40,309 --> 02:41:41,652
MATT: Okay, that's your bonus action.

2878
02:41:41,652 --> 02:41:43,306
TRAVIS: Yeah that's my bonus action.

2879
02:41:43,306 --> 02:41:44,450
TALIESIN: You should see a doctor about that.

2880
02:41:44,450 --> 02:41:47,741
TRAVIS: And can I smash the titanstone knuckles
together to cast Enlarge on myself?

2881
02:41:47,741 --> 02:41:51,921
MATT: Yes, you can. So, you shift into your larger
form.

2882
02:41:51,921 --> 02:41:55,711
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm a bigger fish now.

2883
02:41:55,711 --> 02:41:57,873
LAURA: This is bad.

2884
02:41:57,873 --> 02:42:00,889
MATT: You are still grappled by the creature, but
you are larger.

2885
02:42:00,889 --> 02:42:02,226
TALIESIN: This is monstrous.

2886
02:42:02,226 --> 02:42:07,555
TRAVIS: Can I fight with the strength of the
(sings) titanstone knuckles to break that grapple?

2887
02:42:07,555 --> 02:42:10,780
MATT: To slam your gauntlets together, that
wasn't--

2888
02:42:10,780 --> 02:42:16,652
Does it specify an action on the ability? 
Look at the item.

2889
02:42:16,652 --> 02:42:21,446
TRAVIS: It is an action.

2890
02:42:21,446 --> 02:42:22,216
LAURA: Aw.

2891
02:42:22,216 --> 02:42:24,578
MATT: So you cannot break free currently this
turn. That is your action to transform.

2892
02:42:24,578 --> 02:42:25,651
You're still grappled.

2893
02:42:25,651 --> 02:42:27,101
TRAVIS: He just got a bigger chew toy.

2894
02:42:27,199 --> 02:42:27,993
MATT: Yeah.

2895
02:42:27,993 --> 02:42:31,500
TRAVIS: Sweet. I'm digging it. That's my turn.

2896
02:42:31,500 --> 02:42:32,730
MATT: Okay.

2897
02:42:32,730 --> 02:42:33,943
TRAVIS: Can't do anything else.

2898
02:42:33,943 --> 02:42:34,754
MATT: Tary!

2899
02:42:34,754 --> 02:42:35,256
SAM: Ah!

2900
02:42:35,256 --> 02:42:35,864
MATT: You're up.

2901
02:42:35,864 --> 02:42:36,503
SAM: Me?

2902
02:42:36,503 --> 02:42:37,058
MATT: Yes.

2903
02:42:37,058 --> 02:42:37,883
SAM: Oh, Christ.

2904
02:42:37,883 --> 02:42:39,046
MATT: You're currently grappled, you can't move.

2905
02:42:39,046 --> 02:42:44,193
SAM: I can't move my hands or anything.

2906
02:42:44,193 --> 02:42:46,976
MATT: You can. I mean, you can't move, like your
movement is zero.

2907
02:42:46,976 --> 02:42:47,757
SAM: My body.

2908
02:42:47,757 --> 02:42:51,456
MATT: You can do things. You can still cast. Any
attacks are at disadvantage because you are

2909
02:42:51,456 --> 02:42:53,350
currently restrained within the grapple.

2910
02:42:53,350 --> 02:42:57,567
SAM: Okay. The attacks are at disadvantage. Jesus.

2911
02:42:57,567 --> 02:43:01,945
MATT: Attack rolls. Spells are still unaffected
but--

2912
02:43:01,945 --> 02:43:06,862
SAM: I'm going to reach for my robes, so carefully
sewn by young Laura Bailey.

2913
02:43:06,959 --> 02:43:07,983
LIAM: Who?

2914
02:43:07,983 --> 02:43:09,035
LAURA: Who?

2915
02:43:09,035 --> 02:43:12,259
SAM: And rip off-- I think I have a patch.

2916
02:43:12,259 --> 02:43:15,324
TALIESIN: Like Velcro pants.

2917
02:43:15,324 --> 02:43:17,677
SAM: Don't I have some spells on there?

2918
02:43:17,677 --> 02:43:18,804
LIAM: Stop. Tary time.

2919
02:43:18,804 --> 02:43:20,017
MARISHA: (sings "Hammer Time")

2920
02:43:20,017 --> 02:43:21,151
SAM: Is that from my robe or is that somewhere
else?

2921
02:43:21,151 --> 02:43:22,849
No, you gave me some scroll spells. Some 
spell scrolls.

2922
02:43:22,849 --> 02:43:25,965
MATT: You have some spell scrolls, you have
patches on your robe, and you have your helmet.

2923
02:43:25,965 --> 02:43:28,784
SAM: I wrote down that I have a hypnotic pattern
somehow.

2924
02:43:28,784 --> 02:43:32,376
Was that a patch or was that something else?

2925
02:43:32,376 --> 02:43:33,511
TALIESIN: Hypnotic pattern?

2926
02:43:33,511 --> 02:43:35,695
MATT: That's not part of your helmet, so that
would probably be one of your patches.

2927
02:43:35,695 --> 02:43:36,902
SAM: It must have been a--

2928
02:43:36,902 --> 02:43:38,607
TALIESIN: Like a boy scout!

2929
02:43:38,607 --> 02:43:40,848
SAM: It must have been a patch or something. Oh
yeah!

2930
02:43:40,848 --> 02:43:42,955
Yeah yeah yeah, patch! It's a patch. It's a patch.

2931
02:43:42,955 --> 02:43:43,817
TALIESIN: Bravery!

2932
02:43:43,817 --> 02:43:44,502
MATT: Okay.

2933
02:43:44,502 --> 02:43:45,725
SAM: I'm ripping off a patch.

2934
02:43:45,725 --> 02:43:50,001
MATT: Okay. So you rip off one of the patches and
you go ahead, and you're using Hypnotic Pattern?

2935
02:43:50,001 --> 02:43:50,840
SAM: Yes.

2936
02:43:50,840 --> 02:43:54,519
MATT: That weaves through the air inside a
30-foot cube within range.

2937
02:43:54,519 --> 02:43:56,893
So you create a hypnotic pattern around 
the exterior--

2938
02:43:56,893 --> 02:43:57,575
SAM: Correct.

2939
02:43:57,575 --> 02:43:59,152
MATT: -- of the face of the kraken where the eyes
are.

2940
02:43:59,152 --> 02:43:59,894
SAM: Yes.

2941
02:43:59,894 --> 02:44:02,130
MATT: So as you tear the patch off, you release it
in the water and you watch the patch slowly drift

2942
02:44:02,130 --> 02:44:04,207
up and for a second you're like, "Nothing
happened!"

2943
02:44:04,207 --> 02:44:05,216
SAM: Wait, what?

2944
02:44:05,216 --> 02:44:07,714
MATT: And there's a spark out of your hand (pff)
and you watch as suddenly there's an array of

2945
02:44:07,714 --> 02:44:12,518
colors and various flashes in the face, in the
area around the kraken's face.

2946
02:44:12,518 --> 02:44:14,711
SAM: Oh. Oh I do-- it worked! Okay.

2947
02:44:14,711 --> 02:44:18,102
MATT: Wisdom saving throw. What's your DC? On the
item?

2948
02:44:18,102 --> 02:44:22,105
SAM: On the item. Jesus. So many things.

2949
02:44:22,105 --> 02:44:23,508
LAURA: Magic is hard, guys.

2950
02:44:23,508 --> 02:44:24,273
SAM: I know!

2951
02:44:24,273 --> 02:44:26,315
TALIESIN: Wasn't it easier when you just had to
rhyme?

2952
02:44:26,315 --> 02:44:33,798
SAM: I know, right? It just says 'Spell scroll'.
The item-- I mean, I think it's mine.

2953
02:44:33,798 --> 02:44:35,707
MATT: This is the Robe of Useful Items, correct?

2954
02:44:35,707 --> 02:44:37,294
SAM: Oh. Does that have its own DC?

2955
02:44:37,294 --> 02:44:42,994
MATT: The spell scroll-- oh yes, it is one of the
scrolls.

2956
02:44:42,994 --> 02:44:44,041
TALIESIN: It's nice to see someone else going
through this.

2957
02:44:44,041 --> 02:44:44,734
MARISHA: Yeah.

2958
02:44:44,734 --> 02:44:45,628
SAM: It's just one of the scrolls.

2959
02:44:45,628 --> 02:44:46,627
MATT: So yeah, I'll say I'll just use your DC.

2960
02:44:46,627 --> 02:44:47,284
SAM: My DC?

2961
02:44:47,284 --> 02:44:48,023
MATT: Yeah.

2962
02:44:48,023 --> 02:44:48,993
SAM: Is 17.

2963
02:44:48,993 --> 02:44:50,095
MATT: 17. Wisdom save on that.

2964
02:44:50,095 --> 02:44:51,822
MARISHA: Spells suck.

2965
02:44:51,822 --> 02:44:54,327
MATT: That is a 21. So yes, it saves.

2966
02:44:54,327 --> 02:44:55,058
MARISHA: They're great.

2967
02:44:55,058 --> 02:44:56,320
SAM: Ah, shit.

2968
02:44:56,320 --> 02:44:57,213
MATT: Unfortunately.

2969
02:44:57,213 --> 02:44:58,569
SAM: I thought we were taking him out.

2970
02:44:58,569 --> 02:45:02,589
MATT: So as the spark hits, the slight flash
vanishes and you watch as the lids are still

2971
02:45:02,589 --> 02:45:07,555
closed tight and they open with this horrible
sickening sliding sound and the glowing yellow

2972
02:45:07,555 --> 02:45:12,331
eyes still seem trained on various allies of yours
in the vicinity.

2973
02:45:12,331 --> 02:45:15,098
LAURA: Does he gots two eyes or just the one
eyes?

2974
02:45:15,098 --> 02:45:16,058
MATT: Two eyes.

2975
02:45:16,058 --> 02:45:16,996
LAURA: Got it.

2976
02:45:16,996 --> 02:45:19,665
MATT: All right. Is that your turn, Taryon?

2977
02:45:19,665 --> 02:45:20,425
TALIESIN: He's not a pirate.

2978
02:45:20,425 --> 02:45:21,266
SAM: I mean--

2979
02:45:21,266 --> 02:45:22,177
LAURA and TALIESIN: Arr.

2980
02:45:22,177 --> 02:45:22,786
SAM: Yeah.

2981
02:45:22,887 --> 02:45:23,604
MATT: All right, top of the round.

2982
02:45:23,604 --> 02:45:24,707
SAM: I mean-- I think I'll cast--

2983
02:45:24,707 --> 02:45:25,815
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

2984
02:45:25,815 --> 02:45:27,989
SAM: No. I mean, he's got me grappled. I can't do
Sanctuary, right? He's already got me.

2985
02:45:27,989 --> 02:45:30,138
MATT: Well, you've already used your action to try
and use the patch.

2986
02:45:30,138 --> 02:45:31,730
SAM: That's a bonus action.

2987
02:45:31,730 --> 02:45:33,043
MATT: The patch is a bonus action?

2988
02:45:33,043 --> 02:45:35,094
SAM: Uh, no, the Sanctuary is a bonus action.

2989
02:45:35,094 --> 02:45:36,509
MATT: Then you can do that, yeah.

2990
02:45:36,509 --> 02:45:40,753
SAM: All right, I'll cast Sanctuary on-- on
myself.

2991
02:45:40,753 --> 02:45:42,450
MATT: Okay. Sanctuary on yourself.

2992
02:45:42,450 --> 02:45:44,129
TRAVIS: Don't act like you have to choose who it
goes on.

2993
02:45:44,129 --> 02:45:46,503
MATT: All right, Vax, you're up.

2994
02:45:46,503 --> 02:45:47,549
LIAM: Oh my god.

2995
02:45:47,549 --> 02:45:50,991
MATT: You glance just barely over the side and you
can see it's already wrapped up

2996
02:45:50,991 --> 02:45:53,757
Grog, Taryon, and Percy with its tentacles.

2997
02:45:53,757 --> 02:45:56,613
TRAVIS: But one of us does not look concerned.

2998
02:45:56,613 --> 02:45:57,523
LIAM: Shit.

2999
02:45:57,523 --> 02:45:58,526
MARISHA: Get 'em undone.

3000
02:45:58,526 --> 02:45:59,580
TALIESIN: I'm fine.

3001
02:45:59,580 --> 02:46:00,598
LIAM: What'd you say?

3002
02:46:00,598 --> 02:46:02,005
MARISHA: Get them undone.

3003
02:46:02,005 --> 02:46:07,701
LIAM: I'm going to start-- who's the closest of
all the people grappled to me?

3004
02:46:07,701 --> 02:46:08,939
MATT: That'd be Grog.

3005
02:46:08,939 --> 02:46:16,108
LIAM: Grog, all right. I'm going to start swimming
there over the shells. And I'll blow--

3006
02:46:16,108 --> 02:46:17,659
MATT: (counts) That's as far as you can go.

3007
02:46:17,659 --> 02:46:19,514
LIAM: And I'll use my bonus action for more
movement.

3008
02:46:19,514 --> 02:46:21,159
MARISHA: I hadn't gotten that far.

3009
02:46:21,159 --> 02:46:22,411
MATT: Okay, to dash?

3010
02:46:22,411 --> 02:46:23,293
LIAM: Yeah.

3011
02:46:23,293 --> 02:46:24,324
MARISHA: Give me a week.

3012
02:46:24,324 --> 02:46:25,978
MATT: That'll give you just the time to swim right
next to him.

3013
02:46:25,978 --> 02:46:31,672
LIAM: Okay. And I'd like to use Whisper to tear
into

3014
02:46:31,672 --> 02:46:34,490
the tentacle holding him to try to get him free 
of it.

3015
02:46:34,490 --> 02:46:37,417
MATT: Okay. So are you attempting to--

3016
02:46:37,417 --> 02:46:38,869
LIAM: To un-grapple him.

3017
02:46:38,869 --> 02:46:41,448
MATT: Un-grapple him? All right. I need you to go
ahead and make a--

3018
02:46:41,448 --> 02:46:43,837
because this is not you in the grapple, 
this is him--

3019
02:46:43,837 --> 02:46:44,767
LIAM: Yeah.

3020
02:46:44,767 --> 02:46:45,872
MATT: This is an athletics check.

3021
02:46:45,872 --> 02:46:47,220
LIAM: Athletics check, goddammit Matt!

3022
02:46:47,220 --> 02:46:49,629
MATT: Acrobatics is to escape from it. To help
somebody else

3023
02:46:49,629 --> 02:46:51,828
you're having to actually physically force it off.

3024
02:46:51,828 --> 02:47:02,415
LIAM: Plus-- that's shit. Shit. Luck. 11.

3025
02:47:02,415 --> 02:47:07,208
MATT: Nope. You try and grab, you're hacking at
the side, but as you're hacking with the blade,

3026
02:47:07,327 --> 02:47:13,386
you're watching as it's not quite beating past the
hide of the tentacle around it.

3027
02:47:13,386 --> 02:47:14,705
LIAM: Okay. I'm out.

3028
02:47:14,705 --> 02:47:15,919
MATT: Okay. Keyleth, you're up.

3029
02:47:15,919 --> 02:47:21,546
MARISHA: I knew that's what you were going to say.
So all my friends are still grappled.

3030
02:47:21,546 --> 02:47:22,802
MATT: A lot of them are, yeah.

3031
02:47:22,802 --> 02:47:23,625
TALIESIN: Three of them.

3032
02:47:23,625 --> 02:47:25,598
MATT: Three of them.

3033
02:47:25,598 --> 02:47:29,029
TRAVIS: Just go get the lodestones.

3034
02:47:29,029 --> 02:47:33,511
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to cast Locate Object,
see if I can find that third lodestone.

3035
02:47:33,511 --> 02:47:35,410
MATT: Okay.

3036
02:47:35,410 --> 02:47:39,994
MARISHA: They're fine. You're fine. You're level
16, motherfuckers. You're fine.

3037
02:47:39,994 --> 02:47:41,026
TALIESIN: Oh god, I want to die.

3038
02:47:41,026 --> 02:47:42,237
MARISHA: I want to find the lodestone.

3039
02:47:42,237 --> 02:47:43,104
LIAM: I've been in a dragon.

3040
02:47:43,104 --> 02:47:44,157
TALIESIN: Please help.

3041
02:47:44,157 --> 02:47:44,872
MATT: Okay.

3042
02:47:44,872 --> 02:47:45,801
MARISHA: Locate Object.

3043
02:47:45,801 --> 02:47:52,578
MATT: All right. The third lodestone is in the
direction and just past--

3044
02:47:52,578 --> 02:47:56,598
it's this way, at least.

3045
02:47:56,598 --> 02:47:57,522
MARISHA: I'm sorry.

3046
02:47:57,522 --> 02:47:58,447
LAURA: Wait, which direction?

3047
02:47:58,447 --> 02:47:59,538
MATT: So you're here.

3048
02:47:59,538 --> 02:48:00,368
MARISHA: Your hand is lateral.

3049
02:48:00,368 --> 02:48:01,052
MATT: You're here.

3050
02:48:01,052 --> 02:48:01,671
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah.

3051
02:48:01,671 --> 02:48:02,708
MATT: It's going this way.

3052
02:48:02,708 --> 02:48:04,552
MARISHA: Towards the way your hand is going.

3053
02:48:04,552 --> 02:48:05,439
MATT: Correct.

3054
02:48:05,439 --> 02:48:06,465
TALIESIN: There from you.

3055
02:48:06,465 --> 02:48:09,933
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to use my Alter Self swim
speed.

3056
02:48:09,933 --> 02:48:10,621
MATT: Okay.

3057
02:48:10,621 --> 02:48:14,342
MARISHA: And swim that direction as far as I can.
Do I get a better location on it?

3058
02:48:14,342 --> 02:48:18,041
MATT: You get there, and you're still feeling it
in this direction.

3059
02:48:18,041 --> 02:48:22,173
MARISHA: I'll double my speed.

3060
02:48:22,173 --> 02:48:23,116
MATT: Okay.

3061
02:48:23,116 --> 02:48:28,372
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's really confusing. On a
fundamental level.

3062
02:48:28,372 --> 02:48:33,235
MARISHA: Can I do another investigation check? Is
it near me?

3063
02:48:33,235 --> 02:48:36,601
MATT: Unfortunately, no. Investigation is one of
those things where you spend your action moving

3064
02:48:36,601 --> 02:48:40,548
through and searching in the vicinity. Other than
your bonus action, that's about as much as you can

3065
02:48:40,548 --> 02:48:43,107
get. You just feel it's in this direction from
you.

3066
02:48:43,107 --> 02:48:46,546
MARISHA: Okay. As a bonus action, who's near me?

3067
02:48:46,546 --> 02:48:49,908
MATT: The kraken's about 20 feet above you.

3068
02:48:49,908 --> 02:48:51,875
MARISHA: Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Party members.

3069
02:48:51,875 --> 02:48:57,425
MATT: Party members, you have Percival, Taryon,
and Vax. I'm sorry, that's Vex over there.

3070
02:48:57,425 --> 02:49:00,233
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to do-- you're fine,
right?

3071
02:49:00,233 --> 02:49:01,036
TALIESIN: Eh.

3072
02:49:01,036 --> 02:49:06,459
MARISHA: You're great. I'm going to do a Grasping
Vine and see if I can get Taryon out of the

3073
02:49:06,459 --> 02:49:14,500
kraken's grasp with Grasping Vine.

3074
02:49:14,500 --> 02:49:15,526
MATT: Okay. From--

3075
02:49:15,526 --> 02:49:16,539
MARISHA: A lot of big words.

3076
02:49:16,539 --> 02:49:17,982
TALIESIN: Get Taryon out of the kraken's grasp
with Grasping Vine.

3077
02:49:17,982 --> 02:49:21,560
MATT: Where does the Grasping Vine start from?

3078
02:49:21,560 --> 02:49:25,412
MARISHA: Can I get it kind of towards that--
sorry, deal with me. This guy here?

3079
02:49:25,412 --> 02:49:26,086
MATT: This stone?

3080
02:49:26,086 --> 02:49:27,021
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.

3081
02:49:27,021 --> 02:49:28,799
MATT: Right there? Okay so a vine curls up, whips
towards--

3082
02:49:28,799 --> 02:49:30,231
MARISHA: Taryon.

3083
02:49:30,231 --> 02:49:31,373
MATT: Taryon. Wraps around--

3084
02:49:31,373 --> 02:49:33,273
SAM: (choking sounds)

3085
02:49:33,273 --> 02:49:33,975
TALIESIN: Oh no.

3086
02:49:33,975 --> 02:49:37,710
MATT: For this, I'm going to say this is an
opposed check of the vine versus the kraken's strength.

3087
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:38,564
MARISHA: Strength?

3088
02:49:38,564 --> 02:49:41,462
MATT: I need you to go ahead and roll and add your
wisdom modifier.

3089
02:49:41,462 --> 02:49:42,663
SAM: You're tearing me apart.

3090
02:49:42,663 --> 02:49:44,867
MARISHA: People-killer. People-killer! That's
good!

3091
02:49:44,867 --> 02:49:45,685
TALIESIN: Ooh!

3092
02:49:45,685 --> 02:49:46,729
MARISHA: My strength?

3093
02:49:46,729 --> 02:49:47,926
MATT: No, your wisdom modifier.

3094
02:49:47,926 --> 02:49:48,637
LAURA: No, your wisdom.

3095
02:49:48,637 --> 02:49:49,296
TRAVIS: Wisdom.

3096
02:49:49,296 --> 02:49:50,295
MARISHA: Oh, just my modifier?

3097
02:49:50,295 --> 02:49:51,048
MATT: Just your wisdom modifier.

3098
02:49:51,048 --> 02:49:51,695
LIAM: Wise as fuck.

3099
02:49:51,695 --> 02:49:56,344
MARISHA: Wise as fuck, motherfucker! That was a
15. 26!

3100
02:49:56,344 --> 02:50:01,011
MATT: 26. It tugs and tugs, but it's not strong
enough to break free.

3101
02:50:01,011 --> 02:50:02,853
LAURA: Oh no! He's so strong!

3102
02:50:02,853 --> 02:50:07,696
MATT: The vine is now pulling back and forth
between the tentacle and Taryon's like, argh!

3103
02:50:07,696 --> 02:50:08,857
Being pulled from both sides.

3104
02:50:08,857 --> 02:50:10,025
TALIESIN: Drop it, drop it!

3105
02:50:10,025 --> 02:50:10,786
MARISHA: (yells)

3106
02:50:10,786 --> 02:50:11,445
SAM: (yells)

3107
02:50:11,445 --> 02:50:12,319
LAURA: Oh no!

3108
02:50:12,319 --> 02:50:13,096
MATT: Unfortunately.

3109
02:50:13,096 --> 02:50:14,042
LAURA: It's the Dread Emperor all over again!

3110
02:50:14,042 --> 02:50:15,551
TALIESIN: All over again. Nope. Don't say it.

3111
02:50:15,551 --> 02:50:17,375
TRAVIS: Break him.

3112
02:50:17,375 --> 02:50:19,338
MATT: It's a very strong creature.

3113
02:50:19,338 --> 02:50:25,915
MARISHA: Okay, but I'm still-- lodestone's, over here!
And that's all I get.

3114
02:50:25,918 --> 02:50:27,920
MATT: Okay, ending Keyleth's turn we come to the
top of the round,

3115
02:50:27,920 --> 02:50:30,868
I need everyone to go ahead and
make a constitution saving throw as once again--

3116
02:50:30,868 --> 02:50:31,862
MARISHA: All of us?

3117
02:50:31,862 --> 02:50:33,999
MATT: Once again, the kraken, its eyes light up
blue and

3118
02:50:33,999 --> 02:50:37,830
its tentacles release another burst of
electrical energy in the vicinity.

3119
02:50:37,830 --> 02:50:40,281
TRAVIS: #blessed

3120
02:50:40,281 --> 02:50:42,003
MATT: #blessed

3121
02:50:42,003 --> 02:50:47,012
TRAVIS: Constitution, right?

3122
02:50:47,012 --> 02:50:47,905
MATT: Yes.

3123
02:50:47,905 --> 02:50:48,946
LIAM: (zapping noise)

3124
02:50:48,946 --> 02:50:50,255
SAM: 15.

3125
02:50:50,255 --> 02:50:52,218
MATT: 19 points of lightning damage.

3126
02:50:52,218 --> 02:50:53,170
TALIESIN: 21.

3127
02:50:53,170 --> 02:50:54,347
MATT: 19 points of lightning damage.

3128
02:50:54,347 --> 02:50:55,209
TALIESIN: God damn it!

3129
02:50:55,209 --> 02:50:56,171
MARISHA: Seven.

3130
02:50:56,171 --> 02:50:57,328
MATT: Ooh, 19 points of lightning damage.

3131
02:50:57,328 --> 02:50:58,370
LIAM: Six, Deathwalker's Ward.

3132
02:50:58,370 --> 02:51:00,793
MATT: 19 reduced to nine points of lightning
damage.

3133
02:51:00,793 --> 02:51:02,774
LAURA: I get 19 points.

3134
02:51:02,774 --> 02:51:03,684
MATT: 19 points.

3135
02:51:03,684 --> 02:51:07,502
TRAVIS: 32, and I have resistance to lightning
damage with the Exalted Knuckles.

3136
02:51:07,502 --> 02:51:14,815
MATT: All right so you take 5 points of lightning
damage. Trinket?

3137
02:51:14,815 --> 02:51:16,873
LAURA: Natural 20! Just kidding, he gets it, too.

3138
02:51:16,873 --> 02:51:20,021
(all laugh)

3139
02:51:20,021 --> 02:51:26,196
MATT: Okay, so that is 19 points of lightning
damage. At the end of that turn, the kraken is

3140
02:51:26,196 --> 02:51:32,771
going to go ahead and use-- let's see-- get in
range here-- going to go ahead and use one of its

3141
02:51:32,771 --> 02:51:35,891
legendary actions to do a tentacle attack against
Keyleth.

3142
02:51:35,891 --> 02:51:38,755
LIAM: Good gravy.

3143
02:51:38,755 --> 02:51:41,549
MATT: That is 29.

3144
02:51:41,549 --> 02:51:43,650
MARISHA: That definitely hits.

3145
02:51:43,650 --> 02:51:44,745
SAM: This is a powerful creature.

3146
02:51:44,745 --> 02:51:46,107
TRAVIS: It's like a crustacean beholder.

3147
02:51:46,107 --> 02:51:47,252
LIAM: Yeah.

3148
02:51:47,252 --> 02:51:51,666
MATT: Keyleth, you take 21 points of bludgeoning
damage.

3149
02:51:51,666 --> 02:52:00,927
MARISHA: That really-- that hurts, 21 points, I'm
at 91 so 21 puts me to 70, right? Yeah.

3150
02:52:00,927 --> 02:52:07,885
MATT: I will say I will use these red markers here
as people that are currently grappled.

3151
02:52:07,885 --> 02:52:08,911
TRAVIS: Gra-pelled?

3152
02:52:08,911 --> 02:52:10,548
MATT: Because you are now grappled and
restrained, Keyleth.

3153
02:52:10,548 --> 02:52:12,590
MARISHA: What?

3154
02:52:12,692 --> 02:52:19,406
LAURA: (gasp) Oh yeah, he can grapple like all of
us!

3155
02:52:19,406 --> 02:52:21,887
(Southern accent) He's got enough of those 
tentacles.

3156
02:52:21,887 --> 02:52:23,556
(all laugh)

3157
02:52:23,556 --> 02:52:25,073
MARISHA: Who's not grappled?

3158
02:52:25,073 --> 02:52:25,843
LAURA: Me.

3159
02:52:25,843 --> 02:52:26,864
MATT: Oh, Percival, because of your Hex, I need
you to

3160
02:52:26,864 --> 02:52:28,610
go ahead and make a constitution saving throw.

3161
02:52:28,610 --> 02:52:29,509
LIAM: Your accent is showing.

3162
02:52:29,509 --> 02:52:30,482
LAURA: (Southern accent) It's showing?

3163
02:52:30,482 --> 02:52:31,834
LIAM: Yeah.

3164
02:52:31,834 --> 02:52:33,001
LAURA: Oh no.

3165
02:52:33,001 --> 02:52:34,464
LIAM: (Southern accent) You're talking like that.

3166
02:52:34,464 --> 02:52:36,571
TALIESIN: That's a 19.

3167
02:52:36,571 --> 02:52:37,949
MARISHA: (Southern accent) The later the hour
gets--

3168
02:52:37,949 --> 02:52:38,945
MATT: Okay, you're fine.

3169
02:52:38,945 --> 02:52:39,902
LAURA: (still Southern) No that's mom.

3170
02:52:39,902 --> 02:52:41,765
MARISHA: The longer-- mom's been in town for a
while.

3171
02:52:41,765 --> 02:52:42,975
MATT: That brings us to Vex. Vex, what are you
doing? You're hiding behind the rock.

3172
02:52:42,975 --> 02:52:47,011
You watch as four of your allies are now
grappled by this creature.

3173
02:52:47,011 --> 02:52:54,090
LAURA: Fucking A. I gotta use the Alter Self, so I
can actually do something, though. I won't be able

3174
02:52:54,090 --> 02:52:57,157
to get to anybody, I'm just going to waste a turn.

3175
02:52:57,157 --> 02:52:58,644
MARISHA: Laughing at your accent.

3176
02:52:58,644 --> 02:52:59,959
MATT: All right, so you cast Alter Self on you as
an action?

3177
02:52:59,959 --> 02:53:01,086
LAURA: Oh, am I still doing it?

3178
02:53:01,086 --> 02:53:01,890
MARISHA: A little.

3179
02:53:01,890 --> 02:53:02,568
LIAM: Little bit.

3180
02:53:02,568 --> 02:53:04,255
LAURA: (extra posh) I'm using Alter Self.

3181
02:53:04,255 --> 02:53:06,346
MATT: All right, so you grab the coin that Taryon
gave you. You focus on it--

3182
02:53:06,346 --> 02:53:07,779
LIAM: (Southern accent) Alter Self.

3183
02:53:07,779 --> 02:53:10,702
MATT: And your gills suddenly pull from the side,
and all your fingers get webbed suddenly,

3184
02:53:10,702 --> 02:53:13,426
and you begin to be able to move at your full--

3185
02:53:13,426 --> 02:53:24,698
LAURA: Okay, I'm gonna swim behind the rock-- god
damn it, light-- laser, no! The other rock, sorry.

3186
02:53:25,011 --> 02:53:26,032
MATT: This rock here?

3187
02:53:26,032 --> 02:53:27,746
LAURA: Yeah, but on the other side of it.

3188
02:53:27,746 --> 02:53:31,267
MATT: Okay so that's (counts)--

3189
02:53:31,267 --> 02:53:32,306
LAURA: And I'm gonna--

3190
02:53:32,306 --> 02:53:33,540
MATT: Your full movement.

3191
02:53:33,540 --> 02:53:36,979
LAURA: And I'm gonna use my bonus action to
hide again.

3192
02:53:37,079 --> 02:53:39,554
MATT: Okay. You still have your action, by the
way.

3193
02:53:39,554 --> 02:53:40,502
LAURA: Oh!

3194
02:53:40,502 --> 02:53:42,687
MATT: That was your movement to get the-- oh, no
no no--

3195
02:53:42,687 --> 02:53:44,072
LAURA: No no no, I used Alter Self.

3196
02:53:44,072 --> 02:53:45,861
MATT: Sorry, sorry, action was spell, movement,
you're right, bonus action.

3197
02:53:45,861 --> 02:53:47,747
LAURA: Bonus action to hide.

3198
02:53:47,747 --> 02:53:48,771
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

3199
02:53:48,771 --> 02:53:54,865
SAM: Trinket has to save us all.

3200
02:53:54,865 --> 02:53:56,947
TRAVIS: Trinket's pretty low (laughs).

3201
02:53:56,947 --> 02:54:00,243
LAURA: And you cast a spell so we can't use Pass
Without a Trace Anymore? So that's 24.

3202
02:54:00,243 --> 02:54:01,179
MARISHA: Yeah.

3203
02:54:01,179 --> 02:54:04,962
MATT: Okay. So you're keeping low. At the end of
your turn,

3204
02:54:04,962 --> 02:54:07,461
it's going to use its other two
legendary actions to do Lightning--

3205
02:54:07,461 --> 02:54:13,344
MARISHA: No, no, I cast Grasping Vine, which is
technically a bonus action. It should not impede

3206
02:54:13,344 --> 02:54:19,827
with my concentration spell, so we should still
have Pass Without A Trace, correct?

3207
02:54:19,827 --> 02:54:22,552
Nope! I cast Locate Object--

3208
02:54:22,552 --> 02:54:23,376
LAURA: Yeah, you did.

3209
02:54:23,376 --> 02:54:24,498
MARISHA: Totally ruined that!

3210
02:54:24,498 --> 02:54:25,490
MATT: Yep. Sorry.

3211
02:54:25,490 --> 02:54:26,868
MARISHA: Sorry! Nope.

3212
02:54:26,868 --> 02:54:27,603
MATT: That's okay.

3213
02:54:27,603 --> 02:54:28,480
MARISHA: Lodestone--

3214
02:54:28,480 --> 02:54:29,995
SAM: Marisha argues with herself and loses.

3215
02:54:30,125 --> 02:54:31,340
TRAVIS: Totally loses.

3216
02:54:31,340 --> 02:54:36,034
MARISHA: Yep, podcast coming to the alpha network.
Project Alpha.

3217
02:54:36,034 --> 02:54:38,323
MATT: It uses Lightning Storm with its two other
actions and begins to charge up now, and as most

3218
02:54:38,323 --> 02:54:43,240
of you are in the vicinity you watch as the front
of its mouth-- you now see between the darkness of

3219
02:54:43,240 --> 02:54:47,749
the daylight that is glowing beneath it, the light
begins to surge electrical energy. You see this

3220
02:54:47,749 --> 02:54:54,493
strange beaked, sharp mouth that opens and as it
does, bolts of thick lightning energy shock out

3221
02:54:54,493 --> 02:55:01,099
from it. That's going to be hitting Grog, Vax, and
Percival.

3222
02:55:01,099 --> 02:55:03,022
LIAM: Bless.

3223
02:55:03,022 --> 02:55:09,998
MATT: So I need you guys to make dexterity saving
throws please.

3224
02:55:09,998 --> 02:55:11,719
TALIESIN: Yay!

3225
02:55:11,719 --> 02:55:15,873
MARISHA: Big money no whammies, big money no
whammies!

3226
02:55:15,976 --> 02:55:17,575
TALIESIN: 23!

3227
02:55:17,575 --> 02:55:19,981
MATT: 23, you take 11 points of lightning damage.

3228
02:55:19,981 --> 02:55:20,975
TALIESIN: That'll do.

3229
02:55:20,975 --> 02:55:21,642
SAM: Oh, wow.

3230
02:55:21,642 --> 02:55:22,471
LIAM: 27.

3231
02:55:22,471 --> 02:55:24,005
MATT: You take no points of lightning damage
because of your Evade.

3232
02:55:24,005 --> 02:55:24,792
SAM: Wow!

3233
02:55:24,792 --> 02:55:25,594
LIAM: Yeah.

3234
02:55:25,594 --> 02:55:26,387
MATT: And?

3235
02:55:26,387 --> 02:55:28,008
TRAVIS: 11, but I have resistance to lightning
damage.

3236
02:55:28,008 --> 02:55:28,755
MATT: Right, so you take--

3237
02:55:28,755 --> 02:55:29,794
LIAM: Pirouette.

3238
02:55:29,794 --> 02:55:34,679
MATT: -- 11 points of lightning damage. All right,
that brings us to Percival's turn. You are still

3239
02:55:34,679 --> 02:55:37,116
grappled and held in the creature's grasp.

3240
02:55:37,116 --> 02:55:37,679
TALIESIN: Okay.

3241
02:55:37,679 --> 02:55:38,874
MARISHA: Just get out, man.

3242
02:55:38,874 --> 02:55:43,506
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to try and-- is
acrobatics a way to get out of this?

3243
02:55:43,506 --> 02:55:45,016
MATT: Acrobatics or athletics, your choice.

3244
02:55:45,016 --> 02:55:46,359
TALIESIN: I'll take acrobatics.

3245
02:55:46,359 --> 02:55:48,705
(all laugh)

3246
02:55:48,705 --> 02:55:49,490
MATT: All right.

3247
02:55:49,490 --> 02:55:51,072
LAURA: All of us wiggling.

3248
02:55:51,072 --> 02:55:56,558
TALIESIN: All right, so here go. Let's roll well.
I get advantage on this, right?

3249
02:55:56,558 --> 02:55:57,766
MATT: No.

3250
02:55:57,766 --> 02:56:03,985
TALIESIN: Okay, just thought I'd see if I could
sneak that through. I rolled a really-- I can't

3251
02:56:03,985 --> 02:56:07,174
reroll that with Resolve can I? No, 'cause it's
not a save.

3252
02:56:07,174 --> 02:56:10,872
MARISHA: It's a big-ass kraken, though, it's not
bad.

3253
02:56:10,872 --> 02:56:11,836
TALIESIN: 16.

3254
02:56:11,836 --> 02:56:14,384
MATT: 16? You try and slide through, but it's
holding too fast.

3255
02:56:14,384 --> 02:56:17,385
You can't escape, unfortunately. So 
that's your action.

3256
02:56:17,385 --> 02:56:23,124
TALIESIN: Do I have anything-- with anything else,
do I have anything I can do? Is there a bonus

3257
02:56:23,124 --> 02:56:30,390
action thing I can do here? No, I am just-- yeah.
I think about

3258
02:56:30,390 --> 02:56:33,818
how easy it would be to reload my
gun right now if I had one.

3259
02:56:33,818 --> 02:56:35,639
MATT: Okay. That's your turn?

3260
02:56:35,639 --> 02:56:37,254
TALIESIN: That's-- yeah.

3261
02:56:37,254 --> 02:56:43,099
MATT: All right. It is now the kraken's turn. The
kraken is going to shift over here. Still holding

3262
02:56:43,099 --> 02:56:51,597
you guys in this vicinity, pushes past the area,
kind of reaching the ground area. We're going to

3263
02:56:51,597 --> 02:56:58,110
say push you up to there. It's going to go ahead
and make a bite attack against you, Grog, you're

3264
02:56:58,110 --> 02:57:03,285
the largest meat in this circumstance. That is
going to be a 27 to hit.

3265
02:57:03,285 --> 02:57:04,490
TRAVIS: That hits.

3266
02:57:04,490 --> 02:57:18,904
MATT: All right. So you take 27 points of piercing
damage. Because you are raging it is halved, to

3267
02:57:18,904 --> 02:57:25,992
we'll say 14 points of damage. However. As it
pulls towards you, its tentacles pull up, and

3268
02:57:25,992 --> 02:57:30,153
that giant piercing beak just (gulp noise) swallows
you.

3269
02:57:30,253 --> 02:57:33,950
ALL: What?!

3270
02:57:33,950 --> 02:57:38,478
MATT: You suddenly-- everything goes dark, and you
feel yourself being pulled into the dark interior

3271
02:57:38,478 --> 02:57:44,116
of the kraken, the burning numbness of the acid of
its interior beginning to burn away at the outside

3272
02:57:44,116 --> 02:57:47,225
of your flesh. You are restrained, you are inside,
you are blind.

3273
02:57:47,225 --> 02:57:48,426
TRAVIS: Cool.

3274
02:57:48,426 --> 02:57:50,570
LAURA: Oh my god.

3275
02:57:50,570 --> 02:57:54,027
MATT: You watch Grog, even in his large form, just
disappear inside the kraken's maw.

3276
02:57:54,027 --> 02:57:56,763
That's going to bring us to Grog's turn!

3277
02:57:56,763 --> 02:58:00,512
TRAVIS: Cool. I'm in the womb again.

3278
02:58:00,512 --> 02:58:02,350
MATT: Yes you are.

3279
02:58:02,350 --> 02:58:05,961
TRAVIS: There's fluid. Do I hear a heartbeat?

3280
02:58:05,961 --> 02:58:10,858
MATT: Very faintly you hear (heartbeat sounds).
It's like a triple heartbeat.

3281
02:58:10,858 --> 02:58:16,525
TRAVIS: Nice. Right. Cool. Am I restrained
anymore?

3282
02:58:16,525 --> 02:58:17,648
MATT: Yes.

3283
02:58:17,648 --> 02:58:18,799
TRAVIS: Because I'm in the gut?

3284
02:58:18,799 --> 02:58:20,901
MATT: Because you're inside, being crushed by its
interior muscles

3285
02:58:20,901 --> 02:58:23,224
that are pulling you towards its digestive tract.

3286
02:58:23,224 --> 02:58:24,538
LIAM: It's fun, isn't it?

3287
02:58:24,538 --> 02:58:26,324
TRAVIS: Nice, cool, yeah.

3288
02:58:26,324 --> 02:58:27,587
LAURA: How do you break free of being restrained?

3289
02:58:27,587 --> 02:58:29,503
TRAVIS: That threw off my plan.

3290
02:58:29,503 --> 02:58:32,332
LIAM: Attack with disadvantage.

3291
02:58:32,332 --> 02:58:44,436
TRAVIS: How about-- Yeah, let's try-- God, can I
even make a melee attack here?

3292
02:58:44,436 --> 02:58:46,154
MATT: You can, it's at disadvantage.

3293
02:58:46,154 --> 02:58:49,181
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's give it a whirl, and I'll make
it a reckless attack.

3294
02:58:49,181 --> 02:58:50,379
MARISHA: Yeah yeah yeah!

3295
02:58:50,379 --> 02:58:51,217
LIAM: Bless.

3296
02:58:51,217 --> 02:58:52,336
MATT: Okay, go for it.

3297
02:58:52,336 --> 02:58:52,998
TRAVIS: Bless.

3298
02:58:52,998 --> 02:58:54,238
MATT: Now it's a regular attack, just one roll.

3299
02:58:54,238 --> 02:58:58,705
LIAM: Bless roll. Bless roll. Make that big roll.

3300
02:58:58,705 --> 02:59:00,457
MARISHA: Come on. Come on. You're still blessed
yeah?

3301
02:59:00,457 --> 02:59:01,707
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm still blessed.

3302
02:59:01,707 --> 02:59:05,246
TALIESIN: #blessed.

3303
02:59:05,246 --> 02:59:06,528
TRAVIS: That's a 30.

3304
02:59:06,528 --> 02:59:08,440
MATT: 30 hits.

3305
02:59:08,440 --> 02:59:10,319
TALIESIN: You hit a creature from inside of it--

3306
02:59:10,319 --> 02:59:11,472
MARISHA: Inside of it, yeah yeah yeah.

3307
02:59:11,472 --> 02:59:13,575
TALIESIN: There's literally nowhere your fists
could go that wouldn't hit it.

3308
02:59:13,575 --> 02:59:16,152
LIAM: But it's like--

3309
02:59:16,152 --> 02:59:17,174
TRAVIS: 23.

3310
02:59:17,174 --> 02:59:18,449
MATT: 23, okay.

3311
02:59:18,449 --> 02:59:19,541
LAURA: Are you punching it?

3312
02:59:19,541 --> 02:59:21,716
TRAVIS: Nah, I'm hitting it with the dwarven
thrower.

3313
02:59:21,716 --> 02:59:22,570
MATT: All right.

3314
02:59:22,570 --> 02:59:24,587
TRAVIS: Two hits.

3315
02:59:24,587 --> 02:59:25,420
MATT: Attacking again?

3316
02:59:25,420 --> 02:59:26,106
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3317
02:59:26,106 --> 02:59:26,860
MATT: Same thing?

3318
02:59:26,860 --> 02:59:27,669
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3319
02:59:27,669 --> 02:59:28,646
MATT: One roll.

3320
02:59:28,646 --> 02:59:32,675
TRAVIS: 10. 26.

3321
02:59:32,675 --> 02:59:33,726
MATT: 26 hits. Roll damage.

3322
02:59:33,726 --> 02:59:37,350
TRAVIS: 22.

3323
02:59:37,350 --> 02:59:39,097
MATT: 22. All right.

3324
02:59:39,097 --> 02:59:49,349
TRAVIS: And my bonus action-- I would like to be
very discouraged about my current state of affairs.

3325
02:59:49,349 --> 02:59:50,704
MATT: Just regular rage right now, right?

3326
02:59:50,704 --> 02:59:56,676
TRAVIS: Yep, just regular. Can I use my bonus
action to go into a frenzied rage

3327
02:59:56,676 --> 03:00:02,429
because I have never been swallowed? 
And I don't like it.

3328
03:00:02,429 --> 03:00:07,400
MATT: Okay. Let me check one thing real fast, as
far as the frenzied rage goes.

3329
03:00:07,400 --> 03:00:09,148
LAURA: That's good, that's good, that's good.

3330
03:00:09,148 --> 03:00:10,361
TALIESIN: How do you get un-swallowed?

3331
03:00:10,361 --> 03:00:12,439
MARISHA: Please don't kill the kraken!

3332
03:00:12,439 --> 03:00:14,751
TRAVIS: Fuck this big squid.

3333
03:00:14,751 --> 03:00:18,316
MARISHA: Gonna have a really hard time explaining
that to my ancestors.

3334
03:00:18,316 --> 03:00:20,451
TRAVIS: We can kill them, too, it's not a
problem.

3335
03:00:20,451 --> 03:00:22,315
MARISHA: That's not-- no.

3336
03:00:22,315 --> 03:00:27,542
LAURA: Maybe we can just rip open its guts and
then leave it.

3337
03:00:27,542 --> 03:00:29,437
MATT: All right, so we'll leave that as the turn.
So you go into a frenzied rage as your bonus.

3338
03:00:29,570 --> 03:00:30,218
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3339
03:00:30,218 --> 03:00:31,772
TALIESIN: We'll resuscitate the kraken if it comes
to it.

3340
03:00:31,772 --> 03:00:32,761
MARISHA: I could do that!

3341
03:00:32,761 --> 03:00:33,865
TALIESIN: If we have to resuscitate a kraken--

3342
03:00:33,865 --> 03:00:34,882
TALIESIN and MARISHA: -- we can resuscitate the
kraken.

3343
03:00:34,882 --> 03:00:35,522
LIAM: Yeah.

3344
03:00:35,522 --> 03:00:36,785
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn, Grog.

3345
03:00:36,785 --> 03:00:37,489
TRAVIS: Yes.

3346
03:00:37,489 --> 03:00:38,265
MATT: Tary.

3347
03:00:38,265 --> 03:00:39,428
SAM: Pfft. Still grappled, yes?

3348
03:00:39,428 --> 03:00:40,799
MATT: Still grappled and restrained, yes.

3349
03:00:40,799 --> 03:00:44,238
TALIESIN: Grappling with many things.

3350
03:00:44,238 --> 03:00:47,552
SAM: I feel like I should not be here, but there's
no way I can break free.

3351
03:00:47,552 --> 03:00:50,525
He's super strong, and I'm not. So--

3352
03:00:50,525 --> 03:00:52,509
TALIESIN: Keep fucking with him.

3353
03:00:52,509 --> 03:00:54,155
MATT: As a note, too, those--

3354
03:00:54,155 --> 03:00:55,960
MARISHA: Find the lodestone. I did tell you to
find the lodestone.

3355
03:00:55,960 --> 03:00:57,389
MATT: I forgot earlier.

3356
03:00:57,389 --> 03:00:58,229
LAURA: He's grappled.

3357
03:00:58,229 --> 03:00:59,061
SAM: (muffled) Okay!

3358
03:00:59,061 --> 03:01:01,344
MATT: Any of you that are grappled or restrained
by the creature have disadvantage on your

3359
03:01:01,344 --> 03:01:05,237
dexterity saving throws. I forgot about it
earlier. It's fine going forward. Keep that in mind.

3360
03:01:05,237 --> 03:01:05,607
TRAVIS: Okay.

3361
03:01:05,607 --> 03:01:06,681
LIAM: Okay.

3362
03:01:06,681 --> 03:01:07,792
SAM: Okay. On dexterity saves.

3363
03:01:07,792 --> 03:01:09,057
TALIESIN: Thanks, chat room.

3364
03:01:09,057 --> 03:01:10,661
MATT: Mm-hm. I just remembered from the rules,
here.

3365
03:01:10,661 --> 03:01:11,276
LIAM: Oh.

3366
03:01:11,276 --> 03:01:12,485
SAM: I will rip off--

3367
03:01:12,485 --> 03:01:13,652
MATT: I'm sure chat room was on that.

3368
03:01:13,652 --> 03:01:14,370
TALIESIN: I'm sure chat room was.

3369
03:01:14,370 --> 03:01:16,692
SAM: I will rip off another patch. I'm just using
all my tricks.

3370
03:01:16,692 --> 03:01:18,005
TALIESIN: You don't need no stinkin' patches.

3371
03:01:18,005 --> 03:01:23,691
SAM: I will rip off another patch and use, because
I'm touching it, I will use Vampiric Touch.

3372
03:01:23,691 --> 03:01:25,718
LIAM, LAURA, and TRAVIS: Ooh!

3373
03:01:25,718 --> 03:01:27,366
MATT: Okay!

3374
03:01:27,366 --> 03:01:28,697
TALIESIN: Take you to a goth club.

3375
03:01:28,697 --> 03:01:29,718
LIAM: The twins like.

3376
03:01:29,718 --> 03:01:31,868
MATT: Hah, take you to the goth club. All righty.

3377
03:01:31,868 --> 03:01:33,267
SAM: I think that's a touch spell, right?

3378
03:01:33,267 --> 03:01:36,275
MATT: It is, you still have to roll an attack to
hit it--

3379
03:01:36,275 --> 03:01:38,001
SAM: Shit.

3380
03:01:38,001 --> 03:01:44,416
MATT: But it's a melee spell attack, I'm pretty
sure. So Vampiric Touch.

3381
03:01:44,520 --> 03:01:47,715
All right, so you use your action to cast it on 
yourself and then

3382
03:01:47,715 --> 03:01:50,854
make a melee spell attack against the creature, so
go ahead and roll a d20.

3383
03:01:50,854 --> 03:01:55,351
With disadvantage because you are restrained.

3384
03:01:55,351 --> 03:01:59,019
SAM: Aw. So the lower of those two.

3385
03:01:59,019 --> 03:02:00,249
MATT and TALIESIN: Yeah.

3386
03:02:00,249 --> 03:02:02,315
SAM: I can't use Luck on the lower of those two?

3387
03:02:02,417 --> 03:02:03,288
MATT: You can.

3388
03:02:03,288 --> 03:02:09,450
SAM: Oh. Okay. Okay, that's better. Still not
gonna be enough.

3389
03:02:09,450 --> 03:02:11,744
Plus my spell attack bonus? Is that what, how--?

3390
03:02:11,744 --> 03:02:12,370
MATT: Yes.

3391
03:02:12,370 --> 03:02:14,269
SAM: That's still not gonna be enough. So that's
20?

3392
03:02:14,269 --> 03:02:15,558
MATT: 20 hits!

3393
03:02:15,558 --> 03:02:16,263
SAM: Oh!

3394
03:02:16,263 --> 03:02:16,807
MATT: Yeah!

3395
03:02:16,807 --> 03:02:17,696
TALIESIN: Worth it.

3396
03:02:17,696 --> 03:02:19,415
MATT: All righty, so that's 3d6 necrotic damage

3397
03:02:19,415 --> 03:02:21,229
SAM: That's not a lot

3398
03:02:21,244 --> 03:02:22,182
LAURA: Ooh!

3399
03:02:22,182 --> 03:02:22,727
TALIESIN: That'll help.

3400
03:02:22,727 --> 03:02:23,461
SAM: That's not a lot.

3401
03:02:23,461 --> 03:02:24,273
LAURA: No, that's something.

3402
03:02:24,273 --> 03:02:26,519
SAM: Oh, nine, 14!

3403
03:02:26,519 --> 03:02:32,033
MATT: 14, so you do 14 points of necrotic damage
to the kraken, and you regain seven hit points.

3404
03:02:32,033 --> 03:02:32,740
LAURA: (gasps)

3405
03:02:32,740 --> 03:02:33,431
LIAM: Hey.

3406
03:02:33,431 --> 03:02:34,071
SAM: Nice!

3407
03:02:34,071 --> 03:02:37,026
MATT: As you draw its life force away, grabbing
onto the tendrils of its tentacles like, "Argh!'

3408
03:02:37,026 --> 03:02:40,124
You watch as the necrotic energy pulses into it
and pulls the life force into you

3409
03:02:40,124 --> 03:02:41,017
SAM: Okay.

3410
03:02:41,017 --> 03:02:42,045
MATT: All righty.

3411
03:02:42,045 --> 03:02:43,490
SAM: Y'know, small but okay.

3412
03:02:43,490 --> 03:02:45,138
MATT: All right.

3413
03:02:45,138 --> 03:02:48,452
SAM: And once again casting, recasting Sanctuary
on myself.

3414
03:02:48,452 --> 03:02:51,541
MATT: All righty.

3415
03:02:51,541 --> 03:02:52,916
SAM: Because it went away when I did that.

3416
03:02:52,916 --> 03:02:54,527
MATT: Sanctuary is concentration?

3417
03:02:54,527 --> 03:02:57,326
SAM: No, well, I don't know, but it goes away when
I attack him.

3418
03:02:57,326 --> 03:03:02,034
MATT: True. However, if Sanctuary is a
concentration,

3419
03:03:02,137 --> 03:03:04,428
'cause Vampiric Touch is also a concentration.

3420
03:03:04,428 --> 03:03:07,335
SAM: Well, it would have gone away either way,
right?

3421
03:03:07,335 --> 03:03:09,860
MATT: I'm saying, if Sanctuary is a concentration
spell--

3422
03:03:09,860 --> 03:03:12,814
LAURA: Oh, you can keep up Vampiric Touch if you
want.

3423
03:03:12,814 --> 03:03:14,471
MATT: Yeah, you could do it every turn, if you
wanted.

3424
03:03:14,471 --> 03:03:15,373
SAM: Oh, I can?

3425
03:03:15,373 --> 03:03:16,834
LIAM: Just keep yanking that out.

3426
03:03:16,834 --> 03:03:18,076
SAM: Oh, well then, I'll just keep it going.

3427
03:03:18,076 --> 03:03:19,119
MATT: If you wanted to.

3428
03:03:19,119 --> 03:03:20,394
SAM: Yes, I do, I do.

3429
03:03:20,394 --> 03:03:23,590
MATT: The Sanctuary is not concentration. It lasts
for a minute. So your Sanctuary's still on,

3430
03:03:23,590 --> 03:03:26,575
you don't have to cast it again-- Oh no, you did
attack. So you cast it again.

3431
03:03:26,575 --> 03:03:27,654
SAM: So I do have to cast it again.

3432
03:03:27,654 --> 03:03:28,199
TALIESIN: Oh.

3433
03:03:28,199 --> 03:03:29,470
MATT: But yeah, so you can have both on.

3434
03:03:29,470 --> 03:03:30,392
SAM: Okay. I have both on.

3435
03:03:30,392 --> 03:03:31,635
MATT: There we go. There we go, we figured that
out.

3436
03:03:31,635 --> 03:03:32,495
LIAM: Lot of rules.

3437
03:03:32,495 --> 03:03:34,212
MATT: All righty. Top of the round. Vax, you're
up.

3438
03:03:34,320 --> 03:03:38,432
LIAM: Okay, I'm gonna use Disengage to kick away
from this big fucking thing and start--

3439
03:03:38,432 --> 03:03:40,859
I'm hasted, so I should be able to get to Keyleth.

3440
03:03:40,859 --> 03:03:43,713
MATT: (counting)

3441
03:03:43,713 --> 03:03:44,873
LIAM: And she's grappled, correct?

3442
03:03:44,873 --> 03:03:45,519
MATT: She is.

3443
03:03:45,519 --> 03:03:48,410
LIAM: I'm just gonna start cutting. So, try to do
what I did with Grog before.

3444
03:03:48,410 --> 03:03:49,761
MATT: Okay.

3445
03:03:49,761 --> 03:03:51,774
LIAM: So, athletics, you said?

3446
03:03:51,906 --> 03:03:59,896
MATT: Yeah, I'd say cutting at the tentacle-- I
mean, both are pretty rough for you because you

3447
03:03:59,896 --> 03:04:02,447
don't do a lot of damage with the dagger. I'll say
for the sake of going forward in this,

3448
03:04:02,447 --> 03:04:03,754
go ahead and make an attack roll.

3449
03:04:03,754 --> 03:04:09,319
LIAM: Attack roll. I'm gonna use my last Luck of
the day. Because that was a one.

3450
03:04:09,319 --> 03:04:11,239
MARISHA: Can I say anything to him in the
process?

3451
03:04:11,239 --> 03:04:12,101
MATT: Yeah, you can.

3452
03:04:12,101 --> 03:04:12,915
MARISHA: I can?

3453
03:04:12,915 --> 03:04:13,714
MATT: Yeah.

3454
03:04:13,714 --> 03:04:18,828
MARISHA: I say (garbled) Lodestone! Right there!

3455
03:04:18,828 --> 03:04:20,328
LIAM: I ignore and I keep cutting.

3456
03:04:20,328 --> 03:04:22,193
TALIESIN: I like that we all keep doing that with
the fingers.

3457
03:04:22,193 --> 03:04:24,043
SAM: That's, we got that one already.

3458
03:04:24,043 --> 03:04:25,374
LIAM: 16, 29, that's very high. 31.

3459
03:04:25,374 --> 03:04:26,589
MATT: 31 hits, go ahead and roll damage.

3460
03:04:26,589 --> 03:04:27,515
SAM: We don't know where the next one is.

3461
03:04:27,515 --> 03:04:28,414
TALIESIN: She does.

3462
03:04:28,414 --> 03:04:29,131
MATT: Not Sneak Attack.

3463
03:04:29,131 --> 03:04:29,974
LIAM: Right.

3464
03:04:29,974 --> 03:04:30,731
MARISHA: No, this is the next one!

3465
03:04:30,731 --> 03:04:31,500
SAM: You found it?

3466
03:04:31,500 --> 03:04:32,367
TALIESIN: She found the next one.

3467
03:04:32,367 --> 03:04:33,004
MARISHA: This is the next one, I found it, where I
am!

3468
03:04:33,004 --> 03:04:33,895
LIAM: Because even though she's grappled, it's
still way far away.

3469
03:04:33,895 --> 03:04:35,258
MATT: Yeah. The actual body, the sensitive part of
the body is away.

3470
03:04:35,258 --> 03:04:38,504
LIAM: All right, so, where the hell-- two, plus
ten-- oh boy.

3471
03:04:38,504 --> 03:04:42,015
MARISHA: I'm right there. That's me, the lodestone
is over here somewhere.

3472
03:04:42,015 --> 03:04:44,331
SAM: (sings) That's me in the ocean

3473
03:04:44,331 --> 03:04:47,930
SAM, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: (sing) That's me in
the spotlight--

3474
03:04:47,930 --> 03:04:49,435
LIAM: That's 15.

3475
03:04:49,435 --> 03:04:50,617
MATT: 15 points of damage?

3476
03:04:50,617 --> 03:04:51,384
LIAM: Yeah.

3477
03:04:51,384 --> 03:04:55,745
MATT: All right, you just rush to the side of her
and begin hacking away at the tentacle. You watch

3478
03:04:55,745 --> 03:04:58,540
as you're carving into it and it begins to break
away. It doesn't fully--

3479
03:04:58,540 --> 03:05:02,222
LIAM: I've got one more attack, so I'll keep going
then.

3480
03:05:02,222 --> 03:05:03,056
MATT: Okay, go for it.

3481
03:05:03,056 --> 03:05:10,611
LIAM: All right. This is venom. That's 24, plus--

3482
03:05:10,611 --> 03:05:11,570
MATT: That hits.

3483
03:05:11,570 --> 03:05:18,411
LIAM: Okay, good, plus nothing. Where the hell do
I keep putting my dice? Where's a four? Where's a

3484
03:05:18,510 --> 03:05:24,064
fucking four? There it is, plus four is ten. I'll
unload some poison in it, that's a DC 15.

3485
03:05:24,064 --> 03:05:27,150
MATT: Okay, it succeeds.

3486
03:05:27,150 --> 03:05:31,533
LIAM: Okay. Is it halved then, or nothing, for the
poison?

3487
03:05:31,533 --> 03:05:44,692
MATT: What does it say on the item?

3488
03:05:44,692 --> 03:05:47,556
SAM: Percival! Take this down..

3489
03:05:47,556 --> 03:05:49,340
TALIESIN: Sure.

3490
03:05:49,340 --> 03:05:50,678
LIAM: It doesn't say anything about halving it.

3491
03:05:50,678 --> 03:05:51,704
MATT: Yeah, so it's just--

3492
03:05:51,704 --> 03:05:52,426
LIAM: So I guess that means zero.

3493
03:05:52,426 --> 03:05:53,119
MATT: Nothing.

3494
03:05:53,119 --> 03:05:54,019
LIAM: So ten, for the second.

3495
03:05:54,019 --> 03:05:55,843
MATT: Ten points of damage. Okay, it doesn't quite
carve away entirely.

3496
03:05:55,843 --> 03:05:56,704
LIAM: God damn.

3497
03:05:56,704 --> 03:05:58,872
MATT: It's close, you can see it's taking damage
and the tentacle's starting to pull away--

3498
03:05:58,872 --> 03:05:59,587
LIAM: Yeah.

3499
03:05:59,587 --> 03:06:02,021
MATT: But it's still holding her fast. You're
still grappled.

3500
03:06:02,021 --> 03:06:03,183
MARISHA: I'm still grappled.

3501
03:06:03,183 --> 03:06:04,182
MATT: That's the end of your turn?

3502
03:06:04,182 --> 03:06:05,124
LIAM: That's the end of my turn.

3503
03:06:05,124 --> 03:06:09,684
MATT: Okay. End of your turn, it's going to make a
Bash action. Since Taryon and Percival are right

3504
03:06:09,684 --> 03:06:11,817
next to each other, it takes the two tentacles,
pulls them back,

3505
03:06:11,817 --> 03:06:12,753
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

3506
03:06:12,753 --> 03:06:14,006
MATT: Whack! And slams them into each other.

3507
03:06:14,006 --> 03:06:15,044
TALIESIN: Augh.

3508
03:06:15,044 --> 03:06:16,117
TRAVIS: (cackles)

3509
03:06:16,117 --> 03:06:22,512
MATT: Both of you guys take 11 points of
bludgeoning damage

3510
03:06:22,512 --> 03:06:24,000
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

3511
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:26,218
MATT: And are pushed adjacent to each other, which
you already are.

3512
03:06:26,218 --> 03:06:27,168
TRAVIS: I like this thing.

3513
03:06:27,168 --> 03:06:29,254
MATT: So, that's that.

3514
03:06:29,254 --> 03:06:32,050
TALIESIN: I am not having a happy time. 11
points?

3515
03:06:32,050 --> 03:06:33,338
MATT: All right. Keyleth, you're up.

3516
03:06:33,338 --> 03:06:37,596
MARISHA: Hm, hm hm hm. So I'm still attached?

3517
03:06:37,596 --> 03:06:43,704
MATT: You are, yes. Yeah, there's a 30-foot reach
on each of these tentacles, so you're still just

3518
03:06:43,704 --> 03:06:46,981
on the outskirts of its reach. It's damaged, it's
hurt,

3519
03:06:46,981 --> 03:06:49,556
it would be easier to break free, but it 
would take your action to do so.

3520
03:06:49,556 --> 03:07:01,852
MARISHA: Hm. I turn to Vax, grappled, and I say
Lodestone!, and I point with the best direction

3521
03:07:01,852 --> 03:07:03,444
that I can with my remaining--

3522
03:07:03,444 --> 03:07:05,296
MATT: Okay, so you point this way.

3523
03:07:05,296 --> 03:07:12,113
SAM: Did it make its wisdom saving throw when it
attacked me?

3524
03:07:12,113 --> 03:07:17,224
MATT: Actually, you are part of the Bash, so that
is an 18, plus 12. So yeah, 30.

3525
03:07:17,224 --> 03:07:18,367
SAM: Well then, yes it did.

3526
03:07:18,367 --> 03:07:19,677
(all laugh)

3527
03:07:19,677 --> 03:07:20,584
MATT: Yeah, sorry.

3528
03:07:20,584 --> 03:07:23,415
TRAVIS: Well, fuck. No need to add it up.

3529
03:07:23,415 --> 03:07:24,963
TALIESIN: Oh, I have a saving throw,
constitution-- I have a concentration--

3530
03:07:24,963 --> 03:07:26,292
MATT: Yes, you do.

3531
03:07:26,292 --> 03:07:27,496
TALIESIN: No.

3532
03:07:27,496 --> 03:07:28,256
MATT: What'd you roll?

3533
03:07:28,256 --> 03:07:29,424
TALIESIN and MARISHA: A one.

3534
03:07:29,424 --> 03:07:30,970
MATT: Yeah, Hex is gone, sorry buddy

3535
03:07:30,970 --> 03:07:33,077
MARISHA: Who's still grappled?

3536
03:07:33,077 --> 03:07:34,017
MATT: You are.

3537
03:07:34,017 --> 03:07:35,303
TALIESIN: We are.

3538
03:07:35,303 --> 03:07:37,139
MARISHA: Taryon and Percy?

3539
03:07:37,139 --> 03:07:38,169
MATT: Taryon, Percival--

3540
03:07:38,169 --> 03:07:39,302
MATT: Grog has been swallowed.

3541
03:07:39,302 --> 03:07:40,580
TALIESIN: Grog is in the belly of the beast.

3542
03:07:40,580 --> 03:07:41,408
MARISHA: And Grog.

3543
03:07:41,408 --> 03:07:42,325
TRAVIS: Don't worry about me.

3544
03:07:42,325 --> 03:07:43,375
MATT: Yes.

3545
03:07:43,375 --> 03:07:44,134
MARISHA: Okay--

3546
03:07:44,134 --> 03:07:45,187
TALIESIN: He's happy. He's in a better place.

3547
03:07:45,187 --> 03:07:50,306
MARISHA: I look at the twins, and I say
"Lodestone! There-ish!"

3548
03:07:50,306 --> 03:07:52,339
LAURA: I'm on the other side of the rock but I can
hear you.

3549
03:07:52,339 --> 03:07:57,649
MARISHA: Lodestone! And I do Control Water?

3550
03:07:57,649 --> 03:07:59,331
MATT: Okay.

3551
03:07:59,331 --> 03:08:04,578
MARISHA: And I'm gonna redirect flow, and I'm
gonna push all of us--

3552
03:08:04,578 --> 03:08:11,422
I don't give a fuck, we'll be fine, in this direction. 
You see my laser?

3553
03:08:11,532 --> 03:08:12,691
MATT: This way? You push yourself--

3554
03:08:12,691 --> 03:08:16,008
MARISHA: I want to point us away. So I'm gonna
redirect flow and go poof!

3555
03:08:16,008 --> 03:08:21,695
And push us away from the lodestone, 
in the direction of everyone else.

3556
03:08:21,695 --> 03:08:22,835
LAURA: (gasps)

3557
03:08:22,835 --> 03:08:24,413
MATT: This way. How many feet of movement?

3558
03:08:24,413 --> 03:08:26,144
LAURA: Oh my god, can you get the water away from
the kraken

3559
03:08:26,144 --> 03:08:28,515
and maybe it'll just be on, like, landlocked?

3560
03:08:28,515 --> 03:08:32,532
MARISHA: I can redirect the current of the ocean
for a temporary amount of time.

3561
03:08:32,532 --> 03:08:33,454
LAURA: Right, right.

3562
03:08:33,454 --> 03:08:34,932
MATT: Okay, so you and Vax both?

3563
03:08:34,932 --> 03:08:38,166
MARISHA: All of us, just, me and the kraken, and I
guess

3564
03:08:38,166 --> 03:08:40,936
everyone who's still grappled by him are
going this way.

3565
03:08:40,936 --> 03:08:42,227
MATT: Okay, keeping Vax away.

3566
03:08:42,227 --> 03:08:45,758
MARISHA: Vax and Vex are probably still away.

3567
03:08:45,758 --> 03:08:47,313
MATT: Okay.

3568
03:08:47,313 --> 03:08:48,919
MARISHA: I'm going (sound effects)

3569
03:08:48,919 --> 03:08:51,310
MATT: Okay, so I want you to roll a d20 and add
your wisdom modifier.

3570
03:08:51,310 --> 03:08:53,738
MARISHA: Roll a d20 and add my wisdom modifier?

3571
03:08:53,738 --> 03:08:54,889
MATT: Yes.

3572
03:08:54,889 --> 03:08:56,631
MARISHA: I've got advantage on that, right?

3573
03:08:56,631 --> 03:08:57,192
MATT: No.

3574
03:08:57,192 --> 03:08:58,613
MARISHA: Because of Heroes' Feast?

3575
03:08:58,613 --> 03:08:59,520
LAURA: (gasps)

3576
03:08:59,520 --> 03:09:01,540
MATT: It's your wisdom modifier. It's a wisdom
check, not a wisdom saving throw.

3577
03:09:01,540 --> 03:09:02,821
LAURA and LIAM: Not a wisdom save.

3578
03:09:02,821 --> 03:09:04,825
MARISHA: Ooh! That's good! That's a 17!

3579
03:09:04,825 --> 03:09:07,671
LAURA: (laughs) That was, like, such a grandma
reaction. "Ooh!"

3580
03:09:07,671 --> 03:09:09,352
MARISHA: Plus 11, eight, 28! Ooh!

3581
03:09:09,352 --> 03:09:11,279
MATT: The strength of your control water does
actually--

3582
03:09:11,279 --> 03:09:12,094
MARISHA: 28!

3583
03:09:12,094 --> 03:09:15,478
MATT: -- is stronger than the kraken's current
ability to hold itself in place, so yes--

3584
03:09:15,478 --> 03:09:16,664
MARISHA: Fuck yeah it is!

3585
03:09:16,664 --> 03:09:19,593
MATT: The kraken gets pushed this way about 20
feet.

3586
03:09:19,593 --> 03:09:21,058
SAM: Does it lose its grip on us?

3587
03:09:21,058 --> 03:09:22,544
MATT: You guys get dragged around by 20 feet.

3588
03:09:22,544 --> 03:09:23,936
MARISHA: Did he lose his grip, come on!

3589
03:09:23,936 --> 03:09:25,870
MATT: And you get dragged along with it 20 feet.

3590
03:09:25,870 --> 03:09:27,661
MARISHA: Wait, who? Me?

3591
03:09:27,661 --> 03:09:28,338
LIAM and LAURA: You.

3592
03:09:28,338 --> 03:09:29,132
MATT: Yeah, it pulls you--

3593
03:09:29,132 --> 03:09:30,031
MARISHA: Not Vex and Vax?

3594
03:09:30,031 --> 03:09:30,686
LAURA: No.

3595
03:09:30,686 --> 03:09:31,576
MATT: Not Vex and Vax. Just you.

3596
03:09:31,576 --> 03:09:32,218
MARISHA: Okay.

3597
03:09:32,218 --> 03:09:34,044
MATT: You forced the kraken this way. So yes.

3598
03:09:34,044 --> 03:09:35,640
TRAVIS: Nice.

3599
03:09:35,640 --> 03:09:38,728
MATT: Maintaining concentration, your Locate
Object fails, but you're still controlling, and

3600
03:09:38,728 --> 03:09:41,993
you push the kraken, and the rest of the allies
that are grappled, along with it.

3601
03:09:41,993 --> 03:09:43,908
MARISHA: Get the lodestone!

3602
03:09:43,908 --> 03:09:44,794
LAURA: Right.

3603
03:09:44,794 --> 03:09:45,727
MATT: Okay.

3604
03:09:45,727 --> 03:09:46,724
TRAVIS: Were we supposed to get something?

3605
03:09:46,724 --> 03:09:51,224
MATT: That finishes Keyleth's turn. We're at the
top of this here. So, let's see.

3606
03:09:51,224 --> 03:09:52,653
MARISHA: Bathroom, I'll be back.

3607
03:09:52,653 --> 03:09:53,452
TALIESIN: Yep.

3608
03:09:53,452 --> 03:09:54,221
LIAM: Same.

3609
03:09:54,221 --> 03:09:55,052
TALIESIN: Here to help.

3610
03:09:55,052 --> 03:09:58,027
LAURA: Ah!

3611
03:09:58,027 --> 03:10:00,136
SAM: (sings) That's me in the kraken...

3612
03:10:00,136 --> 03:10:06,342
MATT: As the water begins to force the kraken this
way, with it being pulled and dragged across part

3613
03:10:06,342 --> 03:10:11,064
of the rock nearby, and seeing everyone pushed in
that direction, it turns and tilts sideways, and

3614
03:10:11,064 --> 03:10:16,733
as it does, it pulses with muscles, and releases
this giant cloud of ink--

3615
03:10:16,733 --> 03:10:17,961
TRAVIS: Yes!

3616
03:10:17,961 --> 03:10:24,448
MATT: -- that swallows this vicinity 60 feet in
the area. The entire surrounding vicinity of the

3617
03:10:24,448 --> 03:10:27,394
battlefield, all of a sudden, is now heavily
obscured by black ink.

3618
03:10:27,394 --> 03:10:28,846
TRAVIS: Awesome.

3619
03:10:28,846 --> 03:10:32,222
LAURA: I bet it looks really cool with the
daylight passing through it, though, huh?

3620
03:10:32,222 --> 03:10:35,224
MATT: It doesn't-- it encompasses the area and
blocks out the daylight.

3621
03:10:35,224 --> 03:10:36,931
TALIESIN: It's like watching creamer in coffee in
reverse.

3622
03:10:36,931 --> 03:10:39,648
MATT: Kind of, yeah. Like the ancient in
Neverending Story.

3623
03:10:39,648 --> 03:10:41,568
TALIESIN: (sings)

3624
03:10:41,568 --> 03:10:42,460
LAURA: Awesome.

3625
03:10:42,460 --> 03:10:43,510
MATT: Basically, yeah.

3626
03:10:43,510 --> 03:10:47,136
LAURA: "I can't, I have to keep my feet on the
ground!"

3627
03:10:47,136 --> 03:10:48,743
MATT: Vex, it's your turn.

3628
03:10:48,743 --> 03:10:49,537
LAURA: That's me.

3629
03:10:49,537 --> 03:10:53,744
SAM: Now that Vax and Keyleth are gone, do you
guys hear the faint flapping of wings and moaning?

3630
03:10:53,744 --> 03:10:58,669
LAURA: Oh, creepy. Really creepy. I am going to--
Matt's like.

3631
03:10:58,669 --> 03:10:59,624
TALIESIN: God damn it.

3632
03:10:59,624 --> 03:11:04,037
LAURA: -- swim up and over towards my brother.

3633
03:11:04,037 --> 03:11:04,948
TALIESIN: Thank you for that.

3634
03:11:04,948 --> 03:11:06,451
LAURA: Towards where she was pointing the
lodestone.

3635
03:11:06,451 --> 03:11:08,040
MATT: That's one movement there.

3636
03:11:08,040 --> 03:11:09,137
SAM: Lodestone!

3637
03:11:09,137 --> 03:11:10,531
LAURA: That's with the altered self?

3638
03:11:10,531 --> 03:11:11,500
MATT: Yeah.

3639
03:11:11,500 --> 03:11:12,747
LAURA: Okay.

3640
03:11:12,747 --> 03:11:14,164
TRAVIS: Just like her.

3641
03:11:14,164 --> 03:11:20,394
LAURA: I'm gonna have Trinket-- wow, okay.

3642
03:11:20,394 --> 03:11:30,369
MATT: You just move out of range of the kraken,
but it does not see you because of your hide check

3643
03:11:30,369 --> 03:11:32,665
earlier, so it does not get an attack of
opportunity.

3644
03:11:32,665 --> 03:11:41,753
LAURA: Awesome. I'm gonna have Trinket, for my
bonus action, swim up on top of the kraken's back.

3645
03:11:41,753 --> 03:11:44,339
MATT: All right. We'll say Trinket's right there.

3646
03:11:44,339 --> 03:11:47,137
LAURA: And try to claw through, because he saw
Grog get swallowed.

3647
03:11:47,137 --> 03:11:50,754
MATT: Okay. There is Trinket, currently grappling
onto him.

3648
03:11:50,754 --> 03:11:54,646
LAURA: He's just claws, like, thinking he's going
to get to the belly.

3649
03:11:54,646 --> 03:11:57,690
He's going to attack him with a claw attack.

3650
03:11:57,690 --> 03:11:59,324
MATT: Okay, so make your claw attack against him.

3651
03:11:59,324 --> 03:12:01,342
TRAVIS: Does it have to be at disadvantage?

3652
03:12:01,342 --> 03:12:02,683
MATT: Yeah.

3653
03:12:02,683 --> 03:12:04,267
LAURA: Damn it, that was a good one.

3654
03:12:04,267 --> 03:12:06,085
MATT: I mean, all attacks are at disadvantage
underwater.

3655
03:12:06,085 --> 03:12:06,943
LAURA: Oh!

3656
03:12:06,943 --> 03:12:12,533
TALIESIN: It's good. Nothing bad happened.

3657
03:12:12,533 --> 03:12:17,715
LAURA: 25.

3658
03:12:17,715 --> 03:12:26,355
MATT: Okay. 25? That does hit. Go ahead and roll
damage for cr-- for Trinket.

3659
03:12:26,355 --> 03:12:28,052
LAURA: For creamer! Did you say creamer?

3660
03:12:28,052 --> 03:12:29,423
MATT: I was thinking "Crinket".

3661
03:12:29,423 --> 03:12:30,018
LAURA: Oh, okay.

3662
03:12:30,018 --> 03:12:31,351
MATT: Different creature. That was with
disadvantage, right?

3663
03:12:31,351 --> 03:12:32,271
LAURA and TRAVIS: Yes.

3664
03:12:32,271 --> 03:12:33,538
TRAVIS: 18 and a 16.

3665
03:12:33,538 --> 03:12:34,441
MATT: Nice.

3666
03:12:34,441 --> 03:12:38,531
LAURA: Five plus eight is...

3667
03:12:38,531 --> 03:12:39,665
TRAVIS: 13.

3668
03:12:39,665 --> 03:12:40,554
LAURA: 13!

3669
03:12:40,554 --> 03:12:41,763
TALIESIN: If only we'd brought your robot.

3670
03:12:41,763 --> 03:12:43,936
MATT: 13 points of slashing damage, as Trinket
just rakes into the side of the kraken, cutting

3671
03:12:43,936 --> 03:12:50,668
four distinct lines through the side of its
armored crustacean exterior.

3672
03:12:50,668 --> 03:12:52,722
TRAVIS: It does have that armored out like a
lobster?

3673
03:12:52,722 --> 03:12:54,328
It's not soft and rubbery like an octopus?

3674
03:12:54,328 --> 03:12:55,597
MATT: No, no, there are parts of-- the underside
is,

3675
03:12:55,597 --> 03:12:58,053
but a lot of it has this crustacean-like armor
on the outside.

3676
03:12:58,053 --> 03:12:58,769
TRAVIS: Okay.

3677
03:12:58,769 --> 03:12:59,561
MATT: All right.

3678
03:12:59,561 --> 03:13:01,680
LAURA: And I guess I still have an action, because
I can't

3679
03:13:01,680 --> 03:13:04,783
get close enough to search for the
lodestone?

3680
03:13:04,783 --> 03:13:05,803
MATT: Correct.

3681
03:13:05,803 --> 03:13:15,886
LAURA: So I'm gonna try the thing that I saw very
noisy Keyleth try earlier, which is to shoot out

3682
03:13:15,886 --> 03:13:19,193
Grasping Vine and try to break someone free with
it.

3683
03:13:19,193 --> 03:13:22,418
MATT: Grasping Vine is a bonus action spell.

3684
03:13:22,418 --> 03:13:25,214
LAURA: Grasping Vine-- oh.

3685
03:13:25,214 --> 03:13:27,759
MARISHA: Not concentration, bonus action spell.

3686
03:13:27,759 --> 03:13:29,356
MATT: Yeah, but she already used her bonus action
to let Trinket attack.

3687
03:13:29,356 --> 03:13:30,489
MARISHA: That sucks.

3688
03:13:30,489 --> 03:13:40,084
LAURA: Oh. Okay! Then I'm gonna cast Conjure
Animals and I'm gonna try to cast-- that's third

3689
03:13:40,084 --> 03:13:45,839
level. I get summoned fey creatures, so what's a
fey creature that swims underwater?

3690
03:13:45,839 --> 03:13:47,625
MATT: I don't know, what's a fey creature that
swims underwater?

3691
03:13:47,625 --> 03:13:51,545
MARISHA: You know, things that the Player's
Handbook does not tell you.

3692
03:13:51,545 --> 03:13:52,935
I just want to point that out.

3693
03:13:52,935 --> 03:13:59,421
SAM: I will say this, I know this for a fact, that
it says in the Player's Handbook,

3694
03:13:59,421 --> 03:14:04,174
the Dungeon Master will help you select 
a fey creature.

3695
03:14:04,174 --> 03:14:07,595
(all yell)

3696
03:14:07,595 --> 03:14:09,749
MATT: You realize this doesn't help you...

3697
03:14:09,749 --> 03:14:11,679
TALIESIN: Player's Handbook says a lot of things,
doesn't it?

3698
03:14:11,679 --> 03:14:13,114
LIAM: You just got chat roomed.

3699
03:14:13,114 --> 03:14:15,530
MARISHA: Conjure Woodland Beings, it says right
here--

3700
03:14:15,530 --> 03:14:18,542
SAM: Does it say it?

3701
03:14:18,542 --> 03:14:19,581
MARISHA: Hang on.

3702
03:14:19,581 --> 03:14:21,060
MATT: To what CR, does the spell say?

3703
03:14:21,060 --> 03:14:22,470
LAURA: To what?

3704
03:14:22,470 --> 03:14:24,673
MARISHA: The DM has creature statistics.

3705
03:14:24,673 --> 03:14:25,650
LIAM: CR.

3706
03:14:25,650 --> 03:14:26,527
LAURA: Oh, CR.

3707
03:14:26,527 --> 03:14:28,210
SAM: Okay, it says the DM has creature
statistics.

3708
03:14:28,210 --> 03:14:29,592
MATT: Great.

3709
03:14:29,592 --> 03:14:31,158
TALIESIN: Do you have creature statistics, DM?

3710
03:14:31,158 --> 03:14:32,505
MATT: Let me pick one out for you.

3711
03:14:32,505 --> 03:14:33,779
LAURA: I have my card, wait--

3712
03:14:33,779 --> 03:14:34,882
TALIESIN: We're gonna get little fey minnows.

3713
03:14:34,882 --> 03:14:39,353
MARISHA: Roll initiative for the summoned
creatures as a group.

3714
03:14:39,353 --> 03:14:42,144
LIAM: Edge-of-your-seat action from Critical
Role.

3715
03:14:42,144 --> 03:14:45,038
SAM: Who can look up the stats first?

3716
03:14:45,038 --> 03:14:46,663
MATT: A fey creature...

3717
03:14:46,663 --> 03:14:49,051
TALIESIN: Full-contact stats.

3718
03:14:49,051 --> 03:14:51,992
MATT: There are a lot of fey creatures in the
Monster Manual, Wizards of the Coast.

3719
03:14:51,992 --> 03:14:53,772
Just want to point that out.

3720
03:14:53,772 --> 03:14:57,039
MARISHA: You know, I will say, it's a little
bullshit.

3721
03:14:57,039 --> 03:14:59,666
TALIESIN: There's shade being thrown in every
direction tonight, isn't there?

3722
03:14:59,666 --> 03:15:01,443
MARISHA: It's a little bullshit.

3723
03:15:01,443 --> 03:15:03,214
LAURA: What is a rating one? Is that super lame?

3724
03:15:03,214 --> 03:15:03,946
SAM: Yeah.

3725
03:15:03,946 --> 03:15:05,368
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah.

3726
03:15:05,368 --> 03:15:07,785
LAURA: Rating two is still super lame?

3727
03:15:07,785 --> 03:15:13,329
MARISHA: Well, okay, so us as killer whales, we're
challenge rating three.

3728
03:15:13,329 --> 03:15:16,683
Except none of us are killer whales.

3729
03:15:16,683 --> 03:15:19,152
MATT: Okay, so you're conjuring a fey creature of
challenge rating--

3730
03:15:19,152 --> 03:15:20,529
LAURA: Two.

3731
03:15:20,529 --> 03:15:21,795
MATT: Two. One creature.

3732
03:15:21,795 --> 03:15:22,442
LAURA: Yes.

3733
03:15:22,442 --> 03:15:24,806
MATT: Of two or lower. Okay. So.

3734
03:15:24,806 --> 03:15:26,855
TRAVIS: You make Sebastian the crab.

3735
03:15:26,855 --> 03:15:28,346
MARISHA: You get one fey creature--

3736
03:15:28,346 --> 03:15:31,461
MATT: I fucking hate Summoning spells so much,
they are the bane of my existence.

3737
03:15:31,461 --> 03:15:32,381
LAURA: I'm sorry!

3738
03:15:32,381 --> 03:15:33,171
MATT: Oh, it's okay.

3739
03:15:33,171 --> 03:15:35,212
MARISHA: They're friendly, they roll initiative--

3740
03:15:35,212 --> 03:15:36,340
MATT: Because they're not in the beast section.

3741
03:15:36,340 --> 03:15:37,408
TALIESIN: They sing like Disney characters.

3742
03:15:37,408 --> 03:15:39,160
MARISHA: And they sing like Disney characters.

3743
03:15:39,160 --> 03:15:40,854
TALIESIN: They braid your hair for a bonus
action.

3744
03:15:40,854 --> 03:15:44,548
MARISHA: Basically, Tangled. But not.

3745
03:15:44,548 --> 03:15:46,054
LAURA: I'm sorry, Matthew!

3746
03:15:46,054 --> 03:15:47,236
MATT: It's fine, it's cool.

3747
03:15:47,236 --> 03:15:48,551
LAURA: I'm sorry!

3748
03:15:48,551 --> 03:15:51,017
MATT: I remember all this. It's gonna be great.

3749
03:15:51,017 --> 03:15:52,139
TALIESIN: Have we finally broken Mercer?

3750
03:15:52,139 --> 03:15:55,414
MARISHA: You know, but like for real, they never
tell you the best creatures.

3751
03:15:55,414 --> 03:16:00,543
LAURA: It can be-- you know what? It can be an
animal. I'm conjuring an animal. I can conjure an

3752
03:16:00,543 --> 03:16:05,583
animal. I'm gonna conjure a shark. I've seen a
shark.

3753
03:16:05,583 --> 03:16:07,189
MATT: Fey creature.

3754
03:16:07,189 --> 03:16:09,150
LAURA: Why does it have to be a fey creature? I'm
conjuring an animal.

3755
03:16:09,150 --> 03:16:10,175
TALIESIN: Wait, I can do this.

3756
03:16:10,175 --> 03:16:11,447
MARISHA: You know, that's a good point.

3757
03:16:11,447 --> 03:16:13,345
MATT: You know what? I'll let you. Sure.

3758
03:16:13,345 --> 03:16:14,340
SAM: Sea hag!

3759
03:16:14,340 --> 03:16:17,161
MARISHA: (gasps) Is that a thing?

3760
03:16:17,161 --> 03:16:18,483
LAURA: It's considered fey.

3761
03:16:18,483 --> 03:16:19,757
SAM: Sea hag is a fey. Two challenge.

3762
03:16:19,757 --> 03:16:22,846
MARISHA: Thank you, Google.

3763
03:16:22,846 --> 03:16:25,147
SAM: Sea hag!

3764
03:16:25,147 --> 03:16:27,570
LAURA: It says, 'Each beast is considered fey.'

3765
03:16:27,570 --> 03:16:29,456
MATT: Oh, I see.

3766
03:16:29,456 --> 03:16:32,054
LAURA: You can summon fey spirits that take the
form of beasts.

3767
03:16:32,054 --> 03:16:34,335
MARISHA: And you can get a hunter shark--

3768
03:16:34,335 --> 03:16:35,345
MATT: You are right.

3769
03:16:35,345 --> 03:16:37,388
MARISHA: -- which is a challenge rating of two.

3770
03:16:37,388 --> 03:16:38,501
LAURA: Okay. I cast a shark.

3771
03:16:38,501 --> 03:16:39,665
MATT: All right.

3772
03:16:39,665 --> 03:16:40,720
MARISHA: Hunter Shark!

3773
03:16:40,720 --> 03:16:41,849
MATT: Where do you want it to appear?

3774
03:16:41,849 --> 03:16:44,157
TALIESIN: It's a hunter shark, but it's fey
because it's dyed its hair with a pastel pattern.

3775
03:16:44,157 --> 03:16:48,952
LAURA: Right around the kraken. I want it swimming
around the kraken to distract it.

3776
03:16:48,952 --> 03:16:51,641
MATT: All right, we'll say it's right there. You
get a shark now at the kraken.

3777
03:16:51,641 --> 03:16:56,304
MARISHA: And a hunter shark has blood frenzy,
which means the shark has advantage on melee

3778
03:16:56,304 --> 03:17:00,144
attack rolls against any creature that does not
have all of its hit points.

3779
03:17:00,144 --> 03:17:01,764
LAURA: And it's gonna attack him.

3780
03:17:01,764 --> 03:17:03,132
MATT: All righty.

3781
03:17:03,132 --> 03:17:05,245
SAM: And get eaten.

3782
03:17:05,245 --> 03:17:06,424
MATT: I'm glad we worked this out.

3783
03:17:06,424 --> 03:17:09,035
MARISHA: We're those assholes right now. I just
wanna point that out.

3784
03:17:09,035 --> 03:17:11,083
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make your attack on
it.

3785
03:17:11,083 --> 03:17:12,442
LIAM: For 80-something episodes, yeah.

3786
03:17:12,442 --> 03:17:16,187
MATT: Bite attack. Plus six, with advantage.

3787
03:17:16,187 --> 03:17:17,314
LAURA: Roll what?

3788
03:17:17,314 --> 03:17:23,042
MATT: It has advantage, because it's been damaged.
Plus six.

3789
03:17:23,042 --> 03:17:24,566
LAURA: 11.

3790
03:17:24,566 --> 03:17:30,913
MATT: It bites-- a battle of futility against the
armored exterior of the kraken.

3791
03:17:30,913 --> 03:17:32,627
LAURA: It's more for distraction purpose anyway.

3792
03:17:32,627 --> 03:17:33,975
TALIESIN: Caramel. Caramel. Ow.

3793
03:17:33,975 --> 03:17:35,250
SAM: Totally working.

3794
03:17:35,250 --> 03:17:38,042
LAURA: It will be, if it uses up a fucking
tentacle.

3795
03:17:38,042 --> 03:17:40,042
SAM: Yeah, no, it's great.

3796
03:17:40,042 --> 03:17:41,204
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, we're in.

3797
03:17:41,204 --> 03:17:44,030
TRAVIS: Yeah, he is so ready to use a tentacle on
the hunter shark.

3798
03:17:44,030 --> 03:17:44,930
LAURA: Hey.

3799
03:17:44,930 --> 03:17:48,653
MATT: All right. End of your turn. It's gonna go
ahead and use

3800
03:17:48,653 --> 03:17:52,370
another one of its points to do a-- let's see.

3801
03:17:52,370 --> 03:17:54,897
TALIESIN: This is how he's been plotting our
death.

3802
03:17:54,897 --> 03:17:58,607
MATT: Yeah, it's gonna go ahead and make a
tentacle attack against Trinket,

3803
03:17:58,607 --> 03:18:02,422
who's biting at it currently. That is a 23 to hit.

3804
03:18:02,422 --> 03:18:03,444
LAURA: That hits.

3805
03:18:03,444 --> 03:18:05,815
MATT: All right. Trinket takes--

3806
03:18:05,815 --> 03:18:10,623
LAURA: How close am I? How close am I? How close
am I?

3807
03:18:10,623 --> 03:18:14,285
MATT: 20 points of bludgeoning damage.

3808
03:18:14,285 --> 03:18:17,011
LAURA: Halved. Because of his armor.

3809
03:18:17,011 --> 03:18:21,496
MATT: Because of his armor. And Trinket is
grappled, currently.

3810
03:18:21,496 --> 03:18:23,749
TRAVIS: Jeez.

3811
03:18:23,749 --> 03:18:25,675
LAURA: Everybody's grappled!

3812
03:18:25,675 --> 03:18:33,132
TRAVIS: (sings) Everybody was grappled underwater!
We're all... fucked enchiladas.

3813
03:18:33,132 --> 03:18:35,331
MATT: All right, as that's the end of your turn,
Percival, what are you doing?

3814
03:18:35,331 --> 03:18:42,393
TALIESIN: You know, I'm not having any luck
getting out of this thing. Ah, god. And I get the

3815
03:18:42,393 --> 03:18:47,500
distinct impression that the whole point of this
creature is there's just no escaping it. I'm gonna

3816
03:18:47,500 --> 03:18:50,304
start trying to cut my way out of this thing. I
give up. I'm cutting my way out.

3817
03:18:50,304 --> 03:18:51,728
MATT: Okay.

3818
03:18:51,728 --> 03:18:53,164
MARISHA: Just so long as we don't kill it.

3819
03:18:53,164 --> 03:18:54,306
TALIESIN: No.

3820
03:18:54,306 --> 03:18:55,076
MATT: What are you using to attack?

3821
03:18:55,076 --> 03:18:56,335
MARISHA: Just don't kill it.

3822
03:18:56,335 --> 03:18:57,945
TALIESIN: I'm gonna use my longsword.

3823
03:18:57,945 --> 03:19:00,028
MATT: All right. So attack with disadvantage.

3824
03:19:00,028 --> 03:19:01,513
TALIESIN: Attack with disadvantage.

3825
03:19:01,513 --> 03:19:02,997
MARISHA: Please don't kill it.

3826
03:19:02,997 --> 03:19:04,389
TALIESIN: I can't, it's just gonna--

3827
03:19:04,389 --> 03:19:05,509
LAURA: It's just a tentacle, it's not--

3828
03:19:05,509 --> 03:19:10,119
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's just a tentacle. With the
intent to leave. Oh, that's not bad.

3829
03:19:10,119 --> 03:19:11,979
MARISHA: I'm sorry, I just saw a flash of my
future.

3830
03:19:11,979 --> 03:19:12,944
TALIESIN: 23.

3831
03:19:12,944 --> 03:19:15,457
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage. It is
not a dragon.

3832
03:19:15,457 --> 03:19:17,244
TALIESIN: Okay. I do not have Hex anymore, so
that's--

3833
03:19:17,244 --> 03:19:20,418
LAURA: What if you turned us into animals now?
Will that break the grapple?

3834
03:19:20,418 --> 03:19:21,705
MARISHA: I could, yeah.

3835
03:19:21,705 --> 03:19:23,255
TALIESIN: 13.

3836
03:19:23,255 --> 03:19:24,213
MATT: Okay.

3837
03:19:24,213 --> 03:19:25,971
TALIESIN: And another attack.

3838
03:19:25,971 --> 03:19:27,869
MATT: All right. Go for it. With disadvantage.

3839
03:19:27,869 --> 03:19:30,699
TALIESIN: Also 23.

3840
03:19:30,699 --> 03:19:32,046
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

3841
03:19:32,046 --> 03:19:35,066
TALIESIN: Also 13.

3842
03:19:35,066 --> 03:19:35,971
MATT: All righty.

3843
03:19:35,971 --> 03:19:38,765
TALIESIN: And again.

3844
03:19:38,765 --> 03:19:42,181
MATT: Third attack with your sword, with
disadvantage.

3845
03:19:42,181 --> 03:19:44,242
TALIESIN: 28.

3846
03:19:44,242 --> 03:19:46,033
MATT: 28 hits. Roll damage.

3847
03:19:46,033 --> 03:19:47,358
MARISHA: Did you roll both 16s?

3848
03:19:47,358 --> 03:19:48,346
TALIESIN: Yes, they're both 16s.

3849
03:19:48,346 --> 03:19:49,389
MARISHA: You did. They're both 16s.

3850
03:19:49,389 --> 03:19:52,166
TALIESIN: I know. It's a metaphor. Oh.

3851
03:19:52,166 --> 03:19:53,545
MARISHA: Oh! That's good.

3852
03:19:53,545 --> 03:19:54,644
TALIESIN: 15.

3853
03:19:54,644 --> 03:19:57,156
MATT: 15. With that, you manage to finally--

3854
03:19:57,156 --> 03:19:59,895
TALIESIN: Drop it, drop it, drop it!

3855
03:19:59,895 --> 03:20:04,240
MATT: -- cut through the tentacle. It tears open,
you can see the dark purple blood beginning to

3856
03:20:04,240 --> 03:20:09,072
cloud around the area, as you feel yourself freed
from the tentacle's grasp. That's your action.

3857
03:20:09,072 --> 03:20:12,809
TALIESIN: I am booking towards the big red--

3858
03:20:12,809 --> 03:20:18,265
MATT: This way?

3859
03:20:18,265 --> 03:20:20,329
TALIESIN: No, the other way. I'm booking that
way.

3860
03:20:20,329 --> 03:20:26,061
MARISHA: Sorry, this thing looks very red to us.

3861
03:20:26,061 --> 03:20:26,832
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3862
03:20:26,832 --> 03:20:27,742
MARISHA: This thing.

3863
03:20:27,742 --> 03:20:29,203
TALIESIN: Oh, and it's not red! Oh, that's so
weird.

3864
03:20:29,203 --> 03:20:32,398
MARISHA: It's not red, but on camera it looks very
red to us. This thing.

3865
03:20:32,398 --> 03:20:34,187
MATT: So you're heading this way?

3866
03:20:34,187 --> 03:20:36,887
TALIESIN: I'm heading the opposite direction of
that fucking nightmare monstrosity.

3867
03:20:36,887 --> 03:20:37,572
MATT: This way?

3868
03:20:37,572 --> 03:20:38,258
TALIESIN: Yes.

3869
03:20:38,258 --> 03:20:40,485
MATT: Okay, you can move five, ten--

3870
03:20:40,485 --> 03:20:44,495
TALIESIN: I'm gonna get behind that boulder and
hide, if possible.

3871
03:20:44,495 --> 03:20:47,688
MATT: Here? All right. Okay.

3872
03:20:47,688 --> 03:20:50,039
TALIESIN: Bonus action to hide, or no?

3873
03:20:50,039 --> 03:20:52,059
MATT: Well, it's a bonus action for rogues to
hide.

3874
03:20:52,059 --> 03:20:53,208
LIAM: Rogue shit, yo.

3875
03:20:53,208 --> 03:20:54,359
TALIESIN: So for my bonus action--

3876
03:20:54,359 --> 03:20:55,509
TRAVIS: You just faceplant.

3877
03:20:55,509 --> 03:20:57,727
TALIESIN: Is Minor Illusion a bonus action or
not?

3878
03:20:57,727 --> 03:21:00,120
MATT: I'm pretty sure Minor Illusion is an action.
Sorry.

3879
03:21:00,120 --> 03:21:05,419
TALIESIN: I can't remember, I haven't done it in
so long. And I'm feeling so useless. Yeah.

3880
03:21:05,419 --> 03:21:07,244
MATT: Welcome to fighting a kraken, buddy.

3881
03:21:07,244 --> 03:21:13,397
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm gonna use-- I have a heal. I'm
gonna heal. I'll use my bonus action to heal.

3882
03:21:13,397 --> 03:21:14,175
TRAVIS: Selfish.

3883
03:21:14,175 --> 03:21:15,129
MATT: Okay, go for it.

3884
03:21:15,129 --> 03:21:25,010
TALIESIN: 1d10 plus 12. Where's a d10? That's not
bad. Okay, 18 points.

3885
03:21:25,010 --> 03:21:27,014
Okay, good, I get 18 points back, yay.

3886
03:21:27,014 --> 03:21:35,244
MATT: Okay, there you go. At the end of your turn,
Percival, it's gonna use its third and final

3887
03:21:35,244 --> 03:21:40,791
legendary action to attempt to hit you with a
tentacle. That is 21 to hit.

3888
03:21:40,791 --> 03:21:41,900
TALIESIN: Yeah, that hits.

3889
03:21:41,900 --> 03:21:44,423
MATT: All right. You take--

3890
03:21:44,423 --> 03:21:50,175
MARISHA: You're so grappled again, aren't you?

3891
03:21:50,175 --> 03:21:52,751
MATT: -- 26 points of bludgeoning damage, and you
are grappled once more.

3892
03:21:52,751 --> 03:21:54,621
(all groan)

3893
03:21:54,621 --> 03:21:58,195
TRAVIS: (cackles)

3894
03:21:58,195 --> 03:21:59,764
TALIESIN: 26 points of bludgeoning damage?

3895
03:21:59,764 --> 03:22:00,541
MATT: Yes.

3896
03:22:00,541 --> 03:22:02,582
LIAM: Fucking meatbag, getting knocked around all
the time.

3897
03:22:02,582 --> 03:22:05,170
MARISHA: You spent your entire action getting away
from him.

3898
03:22:05,170 --> 03:22:06,882
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's fine.

3899
03:22:06,882 --> 03:22:08,977
TRAVIS: That's a piece of shit. I love it.

3900
03:22:08,977 --> 03:22:09,715
MATT: Does that end your turn?

3901
03:22:09,715 --> 03:22:10,685
LAURA: Krakens suck.

3902
03:22:10,685 --> 03:22:11,895
MATT: All right. Top of the kraken's turn.

3903
03:22:11,895 --> 03:22:12,778
MARISHA: Fuck this.

3904
03:22:12,778 --> 03:22:13,534
MATT: Grog?

3905
03:22:13,534 --> 03:22:15,316
TRAVIS: Yes? Yeah.

3906
03:22:15,316 --> 03:22:17,568
MATT: The acid from the interior of the kraken
begins to--

3907
03:22:17,568 --> 03:22:18,501
LAURA: Oh god.

3908
03:22:18,501 --> 03:22:23,675
MATT: -- begins to slowly pool around you, and you
feel your flesh on the exterior begin to singe and

3909
03:22:23,675 --> 03:22:25,564
burn and melt away.

3910
03:22:25,564 --> 03:22:27,786
LIAM: Oh jeez.

3911
03:22:27,786 --> 03:22:29,727
MATT: That's a lot of dice. I'm going to go ahead
and use the app here.

3912
03:22:29,727 --> 03:22:31,201
TALIESIN: Oh god.

3913
03:22:31,201 --> 03:22:33,440
LAURA: Oh my god, is it like being in lava?

3914
03:22:33,440 --> 03:22:38,634
TRAVIS: I'm sure it ain't great. I'm sure it ain't
like being at a fucking spa.

3915
03:22:38,634 --> 03:22:40,834
MATT: That is 45 points of acid damage.

3916
03:22:40,834 --> 03:22:41,641
TRAVIS: Okay.

3917
03:22:41,641 --> 03:22:46,652
LAURA: Gulp.

3918
03:22:46,652 --> 03:22:48,370
MATT: All right.

3919
03:22:48,370 --> 03:22:49,248
MARISHA: Holy shit.

3920
03:22:49,248 --> 03:22:50,404
TRAVIS: Fuck.

3921
03:22:50,404 --> 03:22:54,601
MATT: And so, turning around, the kraken's going
to make its way back-- oh no, Trinket. Oh no.

3922
03:22:54,601 --> 03:22:55,909
LAURA: Oh no!

3923
03:22:55,909 --> 03:22:59,935
MATT: Trinket is left this way, it's going to swim
past to there--

3924
03:22:59,935 --> 03:23:06,363
MARISHA: Okay, hang on. My Control Water spell has
a concentration and I create a current--

3925
03:23:06,363 --> 03:23:08,109
LIAM: Ooh, buddy, what are you doing?

3926
03:23:08,109 --> 03:23:09,027
MATT: Correct.

3927
03:23:09,027 --> 03:23:11,237
MARISHA: In a direction for several minutes.

3928
03:23:11,237 --> 03:23:16,310
MATT: I agree. The kraken has an ability called
Freedom of Movement, the kraken ignores difficult

3929
03:23:16,310 --> 03:23:19,129
terrain, and magical effects can't reduce its
speed or cause it to be restrained.

3930
03:23:19,129 --> 03:23:20,704
MARISHA: Well, that's just great.

3931
03:23:20,704 --> 03:23:21,281
MATT: Sorry.

3932
03:23:21,281 --> 03:23:22,195
MARISHA: That's wonderful.

3933
03:23:22,195 --> 03:23:23,778
LAURA: What about my shark? Does it get an attack
of opportunity?

3934
03:23:23,778 --> 03:23:26,512
MATT: Your shark does, yes. As does Trinket,
technically.

3935
03:23:26,512 --> 03:23:28,104
TRAVIS: This little bastard's high-spirited.

3936
03:23:28,104 --> 03:23:30,352
MARISHA: Motherfucker.

3937
03:23:30,352 --> 03:23:32,672
LIAM: The dungeon master is giddy tonight.

3938
03:23:32,672 --> 03:23:34,527
LAURA: I get advantage, right, on it?

3939
03:23:34,527 --> 03:23:35,992
TALIESIN: You are annoyingly cheerful.

3940
03:23:35,992 --> 03:23:38,405
MATT: From the shark? Yes, you do. Trinket has
disadvantage.

3941
03:23:38,405 --> 03:23:40,811
LAURA: Okay. 16 plus six is 22.

3942
03:23:40,811 --> 03:23:42,260
MATT: 22 from the shark. Nice.

3943
03:23:42,260 --> 03:23:44,362
SAM: Cast Hunter Shark on it.

3944
03:23:44,362 --> 03:23:48,198
MATT: All righty. And disadvantage for Trinket?

3945
03:23:48,198 --> 03:23:57,703
LAURA: Oh. 14 for Trinket.

3946
03:23:57,703 --> 03:24:01,322
MATT: Trinket, unfortunately, his claws strike
against the back of its armor as the kraken

3947
03:24:01,322 --> 03:24:04,555
passes. No effect. All right.

3948
03:24:04,555 --> 03:24:08,759
LAURA: Do I roll for the damage? Of the shark?

3949
03:24:08,759 --> 03:24:15,538
MATT: Yes. Oh, that wasn't the damage. Yeah. That
was to hit. So yeah, roll damage for the shark.

3950
03:24:15,538 --> 03:24:18,152
LAURA: 13.

3951
03:24:18,152 --> 03:24:25,019
MATT: 13 points of damage from the shark. Nice.
Yeah. All right, so as the shark bites, and watch

3952
03:24:25,019 --> 03:24:27,653
as it tears away, makes its way over towards the
grappled Keyleth,

3953
03:24:27,653 --> 03:24:32,509
its jaws open with its beaked mouth.

3954
03:24:32,509 --> 03:24:34,182
TALIESIN: There's no room for anything else in
there.

3955
03:24:34,182 --> 03:24:37,285
LIAM: Hey, don't eat my girlfriend. I just got
her.

3956
03:24:37,392 --> 03:24:38,705
MATT: That is 24 to hit.

3957
03:24:38,705 --> 03:24:39,972
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean, yeah.

3958
03:24:39,972 --> 03:24:41,199
MATT: All right.

3959
03:24:41,199 --> 03:24:42,341
TALIESIN: Does it ever not hit?

3960
03:24:42,341 --> 03:24:47,083
SAM: Oh no. Oh no.

3961
03:24:47,083 --> 03:24:48,576
MARISHA: Am I about to be swallowed with Grog?

3962
03:24:48,576 --> 03:24:49,392
SAM: Yes.

3963
03:24:49,392 --> 03:24:52,922
MATT: 22 points of piercing damage, and Keyleth,
you are swallowed by the kraken.

3964
03:24:52,922 --> 03:24:53,897
LAURA: (gasps)

3965
03:24:53,897 --> 03:24:56,211
LIAM: Seven minutes in kraken.

3966
03:24:56,211 --> 03:24:58,113
LAURA: You can do something from the inside.

3967
03:24:58,113 --> 03:25:00,111
MARISHA: 22 points, you said?

3968
03:25:00,111 --> 03:25:00,965
MATT: Yes.

3969
03:25:00,965 --> 03:25:04,302
TALIESIN: Whoever actually succeeded in changing
anything from the inside? Let's be honest here.

3970
03:25:04,302 --> 03:25:05,311
LAURA: Aw.

3971
03:25:05,311 --> 03:25:06,684
TALIESIN: You become part of it.

3972
03:25:06,684 --> 03:25:07,683
LIAM: Let's not get--

3973
03:25:07,683 --> 03:25:11,485
SAM: Part of the system?

3974
03:25:11,485 --> 03:25:13,299
TALIESIN: Just know somehow that this is a
metaphor.

3975
03:25:13,299 --> 03:25:14,536
MARISHA: 48 points.

3976
03:25:14,536 --> 03:25:15,404
TALIESIN: For what?

3977
03:25:15,404 --> 03:25:16,548
TRAVIS: Well, now it's a tribute.

3978
03:25:16,548 --> 03:25:17,509
LAURA: Yeah, this one's crazy.

3979
03:25:17,509 --> 03:25:18,342
TALIESIN: This is bad.

3980
03:25:18,342 --> 03:25:19,401
LIAM: Let's shift to the fire realm.

3981
03:25:19,401 --> 03:25:20,338
MARISHA: Do I see Grog?

3982
03:25:20,338 --> 03:25:23,526
MATT: You see nothing. It is black, blind,
darkness on the inside, and it's not Darkvision

3983
03:25:23,526 --> 03:25:29,403
blindness. It is folds of internal muscle,
tightening flesh across your entire body, so not

3984
03:25:29,403 --> 03:25:33,692
only is there no light, but there is no room to
actually see anything, even with your Darkvision.

3985
03:25:33,692 --> 03:25:34,531
LIAM: Fuck.

3986
03:25:34,531 --> 03:25:35,544
TRAVIS: (fart noise) I'm here!

3987
03:25:35,544 --> 03:25:42,425
MARISHA: Can I like-- a free action to be like,
Grog, I'm in the kraken! as a free action?

3988
03:25:42,425 --> 03:25:47,440
MATT: You scream into it like, Grog!, as you're
being devoured, sure.

3989
03:25:47,440 --> 03:25:48,958
MARISHA: Grog! (gurgling noises)

3990
03:25:48,958 --> 03:25:49,930
TALIESIN: Ew.

3991
03:25:49,930 --> 03:25:52,583
MATT: All right, that ends the kraken's turn,
Grog, you're up.

3992
03:25:52,583 --> 03:26:01,190
TRAVIS: Right. Can I reach around? Do I feel any
dangly bits or something I might be able to yank on?

3993
03:26:01,190 --> 03:26:02,340
MARISHA: Or like-- hands?

3994
03:26:02,340 --> 03:26:04,866
TRAVIS: Or is it smooth? I know I'm like this,
but--

3995
03:26:04,866 --> 03:26:07,986
MATT: You are unable to really feel around. You're
like holding your hammer here, and the whole thing

3996
03:26:08,090 --> 03:26:10,927
is squeezing against you and the muscles are
pulling in, tense.

3997
03:26:10,927 --> 03:26:19,661
TRAVIS: There's no way that I could try and push
out with my legs to try and pull something out of

3998
03:26:19,661 --> 03:26:22,037
the bag of holding, is there? It's too tight for
that.

3999
03:26:22,158 --> 03:26:24,109
MATT: Well, what are you trying to pull out?

4000
03:26:24,109 --> 03:26:26,892
TRAVIS: Maybe the alchemy jug?

4001
03:26:26,892 --> 03:26:29,677
MATT: You could probably pull the alchemy jug out
if you wanted to, yeah.

4002
03:26:29,677 --> 03:26:31,142
TRAVIS: I pull out the alchemy jug.

4003
03:26:31,142 --> 03:26:34,092
MATT: All right. And you force it out and hold it
on the inside.

4004
03:26:34,092 --> 03:26:36,534
TRAVIS: And I get super fucking wasted-- No, I'm
kidding.

4005
03:26:36,534 --> 03:26:38,349
(all laugh)

4006
03:26:38,349 --> 03:26:41,464
TRAVIS: I look inside of it, and I say, oil.

4007
03:26:41,464 --> 03:26:46,945
MATT: Okay. The jug now produces a bunch of oil.

4008
03:26:46,945 --> 03:26:47,802
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4009
03:26:47,802 --> 03:26:49,338
MATT: It gets to fill up the inside of the jug.

4010
03:26:49,338 --> 03:26:51,408
TRAVIS: You know, sea creatures like oil.

4011
03:26:51,408 --> 03:26:54,284
LAURA: Ew. Like, if you swallow cod liver oil, you
vomit? Yeah?

4012
03:26:54,284 --> 03:26:55,099
LIAM: Like castor oil?

4013
03:26:55,099 --> 03:26:56,017
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4014
03:26:56,017 --> 03:26:56,805
LIAM: It greases you up.

4015
03:26:56,805 --> 03:26:57,574
TALIESIN: Unless you're a cod.

4016
03:26:57,574 --> 03:27:00,203
MATT: Or a kraken. All right, so you produce a
bunch of oil for your action, inside the jug.

4017
03:27:00,203 --> 03:27:00,996
TRAVIS: Yup!

4018
03:27:00,996 --> 03:27:02,054
TALIESIN: Grease me up!

4019
03:27:02,054 --> 03:27:03,105
MATT: Is that your turn?

4020
03:27:03,105 --> 03:27:05,189
TRAVIS: Yeah!

4021
03:27:05,189 --> 03:27:11,824
MATT: Okay. That brings us to Taryon. Taryon. You
just watched Keyleth, the pinnacle of leadership,

4022
03:27:11,824 --> 03:27:18,095
the guiding force in this whole adventure, get
swallowed by this terrible, writhing sea monster.

4023
03:27:18,194 --> 03:27:22,359
SAM: It must be part of the plan. You're all
seasoned veterans, right?

4024
03:27:22,359 --> 03:27:24,119
This is all part of the plan, right?

4025
03:27:24,119 --> 03:27:27,105
(screaming)

4026
03:27:27,105 --> 03:27:29,120
SAM: Oh! I've made a horrible mistake!

4027
03:27:29,120 --> 03:27:32,158
(all laugh)

4028
03:27:32,158 --> 03:27:38,469
SAM: Caligo, take me away! Oh my God.

4029
03:27:38,469 --> 03:27:40,613
MATT: What are you doing, Taryon?

4030
03:27:40,613 --> 03:27:47,821
SAM: Well, I saw Percy cut his way out of the
tentacle, so I will try to do the same.

4031
03:27:47,926 --> 03:27:48,792
MATT: Okay.

4032
03:27:48,792 --> 03:27:50,383
TALIESIN: For all the good it did me.

4033
03:27:50,383 --> 03:27:52,651
SAM: I can move my hands, right?

4034
03:27:52,651 --> 03:27:55,498
MATT: You can, it's just any attacks are at
disadvantage, and you can't move.

4035
03:27:55,498 --> 03:28:04,199
SAM: Okay. Then I will reach into my magic bag and
pull out a vial of acid, and slam it on the

4036
03:28:04,199 --> 03:28:07,041
tentacle and see if I can burn through the
tentacle.

4037
03:28:07,041 --> 03:28:13,114
MATT: Okay! Go ahead and make a-- This would
technically be-- a melee or ranged, but we'll say

4038
03:28:13,114 --> 03:28:17,470
because it's so close, roll a D20 twice with
disadvantage, so.

4039
03:28:17,579 --> 03:28:19,974
SAM: Oof. Oof!

4040
03:28:19,974 --> 03:28:21,565
TALIESIN: What. What. What.

4041
03:28:21,565 --> 03:28:24,061
SAM: Terrible.

4042
03:28:24,061 --> 03:28:26,646
MATT: So, with your attack bonus for the attack.

4043
03:28:26,646 --> 03:28:28,020
SAM: Yeah. 12.

4044
03:28:28,020 --> 03:28:29,458
TALIESIN: Did you just grease? Did you just grease
that with tears?

4045
03:28:29,458 --> 03:28:33,670
MATT: Twelve? You reach out to pull it out and
throw it. It tenses once, and then--

4046
03:28:33,670 --> 03:28:35,084
And it just-- It floats away.

4047
03:28:35,084 --> 03:28:36,266
LAURA: Oh no.

4048
03:28:36,266 --> 03:28:37,516
MATT: Before it just slowly sinks into the sand
and rests there.

4049
03:28:37,516 --> 03:28:38,592
TALIESIN: Clink.

4050
03:28:38,592 --> 03:28:39,636
SAM: Damn it.

4051
03:28:39,636 --> 03:28:41,581
LAURA: At least it's still retrievable.

4052
03:28:41,581 --> 03:28:53,515
SAM: Sure. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. And then as my
bonus action, I will say to Percy, Percival, take

4053
03:28:53,515 --> 03:28:58,674
this down! I, Taryon Darrington, being of sound
mind and body,

4054
03:28:58,674 --> 03:29:04,924
hereby do not leave my belongings
to anyone, but prefer to be buried with them.

4055
03:29:04,924 --> 03:29:06,573
(all laugh)

4056
03:29:06,573 --> 03:29:10,432
TALIESIN: I'm going to gaze at him, as a
professional gazer. I'm going to gaze at Taryon.

4057
03:29:10,432 --> 03:29:16,491
And just allow my head wound to just bleed out.

4058
03:29:16,491 --> 03:29:22,496
MATT: You channel Brazio, and stare at him, to
give him disapproval. With, wordless. Okay.

4059
03:29:22,496 --> 03:29:25,325
LIAM: Sweet.

4060
03:29:25,325 --> 03:29:26,737
TALIESIN: I hate you. And you.

4061
03:29:26,737 --> 03:29:29,901
MATT: That ends your turn, Taryon. That ends your
turn, I believe. All right, Vax, you're up.

4062
03:29:29,901 --> 03:29:31,100
LIAM: All right. I have just gone--

4063
03:29:31,100 --> 03:29:32,365
MARISHA: Lodestone! Lodestone!

4064
03:29:32,365 --> 03:29:36,919
LIAM: I have just gone whiter-- My face has gone
whiter than it has since I became a paladin of the

4065
03:29:36,919 --> 03:29:41,460
fucking Raven Queen, seeing Keyleth just get
swallowed up, but I am going to trust that Grog

4066
03:29:41,460 --> 03:29:47,564
and she are going to get themselves out of there,
and I am going to look to where Keyleth pointed,

4067
03:29:47,564 --> 03:29:52,834
and try to see a lump or something, in the sand.

4068
03:29:52,834 --> 03:29:55,057
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

4069
03:29:55,057 --> 03:30:02,757
LIAM: Okay, I made a-- hold on, 18.

4070
03:30:02,858 --> 03:30:08,714
MATT: 18? 18. Okay. You just get to this part of
the sand and you start sifting through and it's

4071
03:30:08,714 --> 03:30:14,584
causing this cloud and you hear the water just
being rapidly whipped through and cut behind you

4072
03:30:14,584 --> 03:30:18,794
from the rapidly moving tentacles. As you pull
through, you just begin with your action to

4073
03:30:18,794 --> 03:30:23,451
uncover what looks to be the very peeking top of
the final lodestone.

4074
03:30:23,451 --> 03:30:25,496
LIAM: Is that one action? Because I have an action
and a bonus action,

4075
03:30:25,496 --> 03:30:27,796
so I'll just do as much as I fucking can 
to dig this fucker out.

4076
03:30:27,796 --> 03:30:29,462
MATT: Bonus action is a weapon attack. So you
manage to--

4077
03:30:29,462 --> 03:30:32,454
LIAM: I'm hasted. The hasted action is only a
weapon attack?

4078
03:30:32,454 --> 03:30:33,504
MATT: Correct.

4079
03:30:33,504 --> 03:30:36,541
LIAM: Okay. Fucking hell.

4080
03:30:36,541 --> 03:30:38,048
MARISHA: Dig. Dig. Dig, dig, dig.

4081
03:30:38,048 --> 03:30:38,926
TRAVIS: Hey, man, you're making progress.

4082
03:30:38,926 --> 03:30:40,206
LIAM: I can't do anything, I can't do anything.

4083
03:30:40,206 --> 03:30:43,063
TRAVIS: You're A1 sauce right now brother, you're
doing all the good things.

4084
03:30:43,063 --> 03:30:46,395
MARISHA: You're so good, you're so good.

4085
03:30:46,395 --> 03:30:48,173
LAURA: Can you use a bonus to help anyone?

4086
03:30:48,173 --> 03:30:51,354
LIAM: No, I mean I'm on concentration for Bless
and they're both in there

4087
03:30:51,354 --> 03:30:52,526
and they probably fucking need it.

4088
03:30:52,526 --> 03:30:53,741
MARISHA: No, you're great, you're great.

4089
03:30:53,741 --> 03:30:54,896
TALIESIN: Throw a knife.

4090
03:30:54,896 --> 03:30:57,449
MARISHA: You're hot. You're great. You're good.
You're warm. You're finding that stone.

4091
03:30:57,449 --> 03:30:59,235
LIAM: I'm done. I'm done.

4092
03:30:59,235 --> 03:31:03,025
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Then it's
going to use a legendary action to attempt to hit

4093
03:31:03,025 --> 03:31:09,631
you with a tentacle. That is a 28 to hit. All
right.

4094
03:31:09,631 --> 03:31:13,792
LIAM: Oh shit, 22. No. Hits me.

4095
03:31:13,792 --> 03:31:15,038
MATT: Yep. That is--

4096
03:31:15,038 --> 03:31:21,254
LIAM: Oh, uh, hold on. Two. What's 28 to hit? Nah,
wouldn't hit 28.

4097
03:31:21,254 --> 03:31:24,080
Never mind. 'Cause I'm blessed but it's not much--

4098
03:31:24,080 --> 03:31:25,557
MATT: 28 points of bludgeoning damage.

4099
03:31:25,557 --> 03:31:26,751
LIAM. Okay. Uncanny Dodge?

4100
03:31:26,751 --> 03:31:31,703
MATT: Okay, so reduce that by half, so it's 14 and
you are grappled.

4101
03:31:31,703 --> 03:31:33,152
LIAM: Oh, good.

4102
03:31:33,152 --> 03:31:35,804
MATT: As the tentacle wraps around you.

4103
03:31:35,804 --> 03:31:37,379
TALIESIN: Does it have a limited number of
tentacles?

4104
03:31:37,379 --> 03:31:40,390
MATT: Currently now nine.

4105
03:31:40,390 --> 03:31:42,492
LAURA: Nine tentacles?

4106
03:31:42,492 --> 03:31:43,429
MARISHA: More than us.

4107
03:31:43,429 --> 03:31:44,382
TRAVIS: It had ten.

4108
03:31:44,382 --> 03:31:46,527
MATT: It had ten, now it has nine.

4109
03:31:46,527 --> 03:31:47,328
MARISHA: More than us.

4110
03:31:47,328 --> 03:31:49,871
TALIESIN: But if we keep playing it may have
eight, then seven, then six.

4111
03:31:49,871 --> 03:31:52,012
MATT: That might possibly be an option.

4112
03:31:52,012 --> 03:31:53,666
LAURA: Or it might just swallow all of us.

4113
03:31:53,666 --> 03:31:55,518
MARISHA: More than us.

4114
03:31:55,518 --> 03:32:00,163
LAURA: And then we just Planeshift from the inside
of the kraken, and everything's okey-dokey.

4115
03:32:00,163 --> 03:32:05,275
MARISHA: Which, I have Planeshift if all goes
terribly wrong.

4116
03:32:05,275 --> 03:32:06,710
LAURA: But we all have to be holding hands.

4117
03:32:06,710 --> 03:32:07,803
MARISHA: That's true.

4118
03:32:07,803 --> 03:32:09,127
TRAVIS: Ha, just you and me live.

4119
03:32:09,127 --> 03:32:12,035
(all laugh)

4120
03:32:12,035 --> 03:32:15,042
TALIESIN: The Grog and Keyleth show? I would watch
that.

4121
03:32:15,042 --> 03:32:16,476
MATT: All right, so. That's Vax's turn. Keyleth,
you're up.

4122
03:32:16,476 --> 03:32:20,030
MARISHA: Grog!

4123
03:32:20,030 --> 03:32:23,143
TRAVIS: What, jesus, I'm right fucking here. Yes,
it sucks.

4124
03:32:23,143 --> 03:32:26,085
MARISHA: Grog! And I reach out. He's saying. Do I
feel him?

4125
03:32:26,085 --> 03:32:31,504
MATT: We'll say that you're just, as the muscles
squeeze you deeper in its body,

4126
03:32:31,504 --> 03:32:35,000
you kind of slam into what feels like a 
hard bottom of a boot.

4127
03:32:35,000 --> 03:32:44,535
MARISHA: I still have Control Water. As a
concentration.

4128
03:32:44,535 --> 03:32:49,240
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw as you
were damaged by the piercing maw.

4129
03:32:49,340 --> 03:32:50,721
MARISHA: Yep, you're not wrong.

4130
03:32:50,721 --> 03:32:53,339
MATT: Which is, we'll say 24, so go ahead and--
can't remember

4131
03:32:53,339 --> 03:32:55,067
what the number was but we'll go with that.

4132
03:32:55,067 --> 03:32:58,072
MARISHA: Come on.
Concentration?

4133
03:32:58,173 --> 03:32:59,908
MATT: Which you have advantage on because of your
Warcasters.

4134
03:32:59,908 --> 03:33:05,879
MARISHA: Which I have advantage, oh, I'm a 
Warcaster! That's 16. No, I'll take the 16. What?

4135
03:33:06,177 --> 03:33:07,797
MATT: Constitution saving throw.

4136
03:33:07,797 --> 03:33:09,980
MARISHA: Okay. 22!

4137
03:33:09,980 --> 03:33:11,182
MATT: Okay, so you maintain concentration.

4138
03:33:11,182 --> 03:33:13,183
MARISHA: Okay. And I find Grog.

4139
03:33:13,183 --> 03:33:14,216
MATT: You do.

4140
03:33:14,216 --> 03:33:15,580
MARISHA: And I Control Water.

4141
03:33:15,580 --> 03:33:16,429
MATT: Yeah.

4142
03:33:16,429 --> 03:33:17,754
MARISHA: Is it watery in this?

4143
03:33:17,754 --> 03:33:20,586
MATT: No, it is muscles tensing, and a thin layer
of acid.

4144
03:33:20,586 --> 03:33:21,880
TRAVIS: And oil.

4145
03:33:21,880 --> 03:33:23,798
MATT: And oil is inside the jug.

4146
03:33:23,798 --> 03:33:26,150
TALIESIN: You didn't pour it.

4147
03:33:26,150 --> 03:33:29,841
TRAVIS: Oh! Is it not just floating amniotic, like
water, in this esophagi?

4148
03:33:29,841 --> 03:33:31,398
LAURA: No, that's what he just said, there's no
water.

4149
03:33:31,398 --> 03:33:32,980
MATT: Currently you're in the stomach, not the
esophagus.

4150
03:33:32,980 --> 03:33:35,737
TRAVIS: Anatomy.

4151
03:33:35,737 --> 03:33:42,058
MARISHA: No water, though? I can't like jettison
myself out of this guy's mouth? All right.

4152
03:33:42,058 --> 03:33:46,545
MATT: You can spend your action to try?

4153
03:33:46,545 --> 03:33:48,617
MARISHA: Okay. No. That's fine.

4154
03:33:48,617 --> 03:33:50,033
TALIESIN: There's options.

4155
03:33:50,033 --> 03:33:52,909
MATT: There's not a lot of water in this space.
Right now, it's mostly like

4156
03:33:52,909 --> 03:33:56,553
actual stomach acid of the creature 
and muscles that are tensing around.

4157
03:33:56,553 --> 03:33:59,642
MARISHA: Okay. We have oil. Right?

4158
03:33:59,642 --> 03:34:00,463
LAURA: Yeah.

4159
03:34:00,463 --> 03:34:01,092
MATT: Yeah.

4160
03:34:01,092 --> 03:34:07,536
MARISHA: I tell Grog, I say, Hold on, and I cast a
Fireball right in front of us,

4161
03:34:07,536 --> 03:34:11,129
to try and jettison ourselves out with my Spire.

4162
03:34:11,129 --> 03:34:12,683
TRAVIS: I'm a big fan of this.

4163
03:34:12,683 --> 03:34:16,844
MARISHA: With my Spire of Conflux I go (explosion)
and try and give

4164
03:34:16,844 --> 03:34:19,720
this motherfucker the worst heartburn 
he's ever experienced.

4165
03:34:19,720 --> 03:34:21,767
TRAVIS: Yeah get your Zantac 75 now, bitch.

4166
03:34:21,767 --> 03:34:23,019
MATT: Okay!

4167
03:34:23,019 --> 03:34:24,507
TALIESIN: You put that kraken on Hot Pepper
Gaming.

4168
03:34:24,507 --> 03:34:28,211
MATT: I need you both to make dexterity saving
throws with disadvantage.

4169
03:34:28,313 --> 03:34:30,432
LAURA: He's going to shoot out some watery
lodestones.

4170
03:34:30,432 --> 03:34:32,806
TRAVIS: I'm at advantage, though, so I just roll
one.

4171
03:34:32,806 --> 03:34:34,741
TALIESIN: Lode liquid.

4172
03:34:34,741 --> 03:34:35,945
MATT: Yes. Okay.

4173
03:34:35,945 --> 03:34:40,071
LIAM: Jackpot. Dex save at disadvantage.

4174
03:34:40,071 --> 03:34:43,048
TRAVIS: 11. Oh wait, man, wait, blessed.

4175
03:34:43,048 --> 03:34:44,191
MARISHA: I'm making a dex save?

4176
03:34:44,191 --> 03:34:44,959
MATT: At disadvantage.

4177
03:34:44,959 --> 03:34:46,135
MARISHA: At disadvantage.

4178
03:34:46,135 --> 03:34:46,958
TRAVIS: 13.

4179
03:34:46,958 --> 03:34:57,538
MARISHA: At disadvantage? That was eight. Plus
dex, which is five, so that's--

4180
03:34:57,538 --> 03:34:58,497
LAURA: Plus bless!

4181
03:34:58,497 --> 03:34:59,919
MARISHA: Plus blessed!

4182
03:34:59,919 --> 03:35:00,895
TALIESIN: Hashtag.

4183
03:35:00,895 --> 03:35:06,660
MARISHA: #blessed. Ooh, that's good, that's good.
That's 13, so that's 18!

4184
03:35:06,660 --> 03:35:08,989
MATT: What's the DC on the spell for your staff?

4185
03:35:08,989 --> 03:35:14,432
MARISHA: It doesn't say.

4186
03:35:14,432 --> 03:35:15,616
MATT: So it'd be your spell DC.

4187
03:35:15,616 --> 03:35:22,690
MARISHA: Which is 20. If I'm fully equipped.

4188
03:35:22,690 --> 03:35:25,327
MATT: Yeah, so you do not make your save. Your
spell's too powerful.

4189
03:35:25,327 --> 03:35:27,016
So you go ahead and roll damage.

4190
03:35:27,016 --> 03:35:28,059
MARISHA: On myself.

4191
03:35:28,059 --> 03:35:28,853
LAURA: Oh!

4192
03:35:28,853 --> 03:35:29,934
TRAVIS: Oh, like a, 13.

4193
03:35:29,934 --> 03:35:37,049
MATT: Yep. So go ahead and roll 8d6 damage, to
you, you and the kraken. Usually if a creature's

4194
03:35:37,049 --> 03:35:41,054
fully submerged in water it has damage resistance
because of the water around it. However, the spell

4195
03:35:41,054 --> 03:35:44,345
is inside of it so I will say that it does not get
the fire resistance.

4196
03:35:44,345 --> 03:35:47,855
TRAVIS: I do have fire resistance, so I'm okay.
I'm excited about this.

4197
03:35:47,855 --> 03:35:48,846
MATT: You take half damage.

4198
03:35:48,846 --> 03:35:50,259
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

4199
03:35:50,259 --> 03:35:52,445
MARISHA: I will be exceedingly angry if I have
to--

4200
03:35:52,445 --> 03:35:54,049
TALIESIN: We will save the kraken.

4201
03:35:54,160 --> 03:35:56,406
LAURA: If you knock yourself unconscious with your own
fireball?

4202
03:35:56,406 --> 03:35:58,753
MARISHA: I don't care about that, I care more
about the kraken at this point.

4203
03:35:58,865 --> 03:36:05,018
This is my life's work. Literally
Keyleth's life work.

4204
03:36:05,122 --> 03:36:07,471
TALIESIN: Oh wow, a lot happened there.

4205
03:36:07,471 --> 03:36:12,101
MARISHA: Okay, five, six, seven, eight, nine, plus
four, which is 13,

4206
03:36:12,101 --> 03:36:20,969
plus another six which is 16, 19, and 
a six which is 25.

4207
03:36:20,969 --> 03:36:22,054
TRAVIS: 25.

4208
03:36:22,054 --> 03:36:27,881
MATT: 25, was what you needed to force it to make
a constitution saving throw.

4209
03:36:27,881 --> 03:36:29,397
TRAVIS: 25 exactly? Wow.

4210
03:36:29,397 --> 03:36:30,334
LAURA: Wow.

4211
03:36:30,334 --> 03:36:33,287
MATT: Well, based on the circumstances I halved
the damage required for it to make the saving

4212
03:36:33,287 --> 03:36:36,580
throw to regurgitate. However a fireball explosion
based on the--

4213
03:36:36,580 --> 03:36:41,559
MARISHA: Three, four, five, six, seven, eight. I'm
sorry. You said 8d6?

4214
03:36:41,559 --> 03:36:42,698
MATT: Yes.

4215
03:36:42,698 --> 03:36:45,099
MARISHA: It's actually 29 points.

4216
03:36:45,099 --> 03:36:48,332
MATT: All right. So--

4217
03:36:48,332 --> 03:36:50,008
MARISHA: Please don't kill this thing.

4218
03:36:50,008 --> 03:36:54,669
MATT: No. As the Fireball explodes, the oil that
you created inside ignites and also detonates.

4219
03:36:54,669 --> 03:36:55,658
TALIESIN: Yes!

4220
03:36:55,658 --> 03:36:57,158
TRAVIS: Alchemy jug!

4221
03:36:57,158 --> 03:36:59,153
MATT: Roll a d20 for the strength of the jug.

4222
03:36:59,153 --> 03:37:01,384
LAURA: No! It could kill the jug!

4223
03:37:01,384 --> 03:37:03,425
MARISHA: Who? Him? No, Grog!

4224
03:37:03,425 --> 03:37:05,103
LAURA: That's good.

4225
03:37:05,103 --> 03:37:05,992
TRAVIS: 15.

4226
03:37:05,992 --> 03:37:07,478
MATT: Okay. The jug withstands the force of the
blow.

4227
03:37:07,478 --> 03:37:09,203
(all cheer)

4228
03:37:09,203 --> 03:37:10,024
TALIESIN: Good jug.

4229
03:37:10,024 --> 03:37:11,297
MATT: The jug, however, detonates.

4230
03:37:11,297 --> 03:37:17,975
TALIESIN: Yeah! I love everything that's
happening.

4231
03:37:17,975 --> 03:37:20,414
SAM: That's gonna be extra damage to you,
Groggy-pants.

4232
03:37:20,414 --> 03:37:23,503
MATT: For an additional 18 points of fire damage
to both of you.

4233
03:37:23,503 --> 03:37:25,072
LIAM: Kraken's gonna get burning squirts.

4234
03:37:25,072 --> 03:37:26,245
LAURA: Oh shit.

4235
03:37:26,245 --> 03:37:27,212
TALIESIN: And the kraken.

4236
03:37:27,212 --> 03:37:28,376
TRAVIS: To half because I have fire resistance.

4237
03:37:28,376 --> 03:37:29,351
MATT: And the kraken.

4238
03:37:29,351 --> 03:37:30,385
MARISHA: 18 points, that I can deal with.

4239
03:37:30,385 --> 03:37:31,511
SAM: Plus 25.

4240
03:37:31,511 --> 03:37:32,433
MARISHA: Wait, plus 25?

4241
03:37:32,433 --> 03:37:33,901
MATT: This is on top of what you did.

4242
03:37:33,901 --> 03:37:34,793
TRAVIS: So 39.

4243
03:37:34,793 --> 03:37:35,626
MATT: Correct.

4244
03:37:35,626 --> 03:37:36,944
MARISHA: So 25 plus 18 which is what--

4245
03:37:36,944 --> 03:37:39,329
SAM: 43.

4246
03:37:39,435 --> 03:37:40,398
MATT: That would be 43.

4247
03:37:40,398 --> 03:37:41,571
MARISHA: 43 points of damage!

4248
03:37:41,571 --> 03:37:42,576
TALIESIN: You're alive!

4249
03:37:42,576 --> 03:37:43,715
TRAVIS: 22 to me, because, resistance.

4250
03:37:43,715 --> 03:37:44,803
MARISHA: I am alive.

4251
03:37:44,803 --> 03:37:46,846
MATT: Fucking rolled a natural one!

4252
03:37:46,846 --> 03:37:47,683
TRAVIS: Did you?

4253
03:37:47,683 --> 03:37:48,756
(all yell)

4254
03:37:48,756 --> 03:37:53,231
MATT: I'm not even joking. On its constitution,
it's a DC 25 constitution saving throw, even with

4255
03:37:53,231 --> 03:38:00,828
+15, it's a natural one. And so (explosion) it
bursts inside, you watch the eyes bulge on the

4256
03:38:00,828 --> 03:38:10,142
outside of this kraken as suddenly it vomits out a
burst of smoke, dark, kind of bloody water, acid, and

4257
03:38:10,234 --> 03:38:14,527
both Keyleth and Grog are jettisoned out of the
front of the kraken's mouth.

4258
03:38:14,527 --> 03:38:16,898
TALIESIN: What are the chances it dropped any of
us while this happened?

4259
03:38:17,199 --> 03:38:17,974
MATT: Nothing.

4260
03:38:17,974 --> 03:38:18,668
TALIESIN: Nothing.

4261
03:38:18,668 --> 03:38:19,541
SAM: Yeah.

4262
03:38:19,541 --> 03:38:20,771
MARISHA: But Grog and I are out?

4263
03:38:20,771 --> 03:38:23,468
LIAM: But, everyone on the outside just goes--

4264
03:38:23,468 --> 03:38:26,088
TALIESIN: Kinda what I was expecting, to be
magnificently frank.

4265
03:38:26,088 --> 03:38:28,574
SAM: I see him vomit, and I'm like, you and me
both, buddy.

4266
03:38:28,574 --> 03:38:31,668
(all laugh)

4267
03:38:31,668 --> 03:38:33,703
MARISHA: Do I still have a bonus action?

4268
03:38:33,703 --> 03:38:35,407
MATT: You would, yes.

4269
03:38:35,407 --> 03:38:37,792
MARISHA: I'm going to cast Healing Word on
myself.

4270
03:38:37,792 --> 03:38:38,498
MATT: Okay.

4271
03:38:38,498 --> 03:38:41,038
MARISHA: At second level. Sorry.

4272
03:38:41,038 --> 03:38:43,623
MATT: Go for it.

4273
03:38:43,623 --> 03:38:47,172
MARISHA: That's two. Because I'm hurting.

4274
03:38:47,172 --> 03:38:50,585
MATT: Remember, you still have your Wild Shape
forms too.

4275
03:38:50,585 --> 03:38:51,917
MARISHA: Oh, I know.

4276
03:38:51,917 --> 03:38:54,120
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn, Keyleth.

4277
03:38:54,120 --> 03:39:00,763
MARISHA: Four, five, plus-- six. Yep, that ends my
turn.

4278
03:39:00,763 --> 03:39:07,227
MATT: All right. Secondary legendary action to go
ahead and as soon as you guys emerge, one of its

4279
03:39:07,227 --> 03:39:13,680
tentacles wraps out in your direction, Keyleth.
That's a-- plus 18, yeah that hits you for like

4280
03:39:13,680 --> 03:39:19,353
32. So as soon as you emerge, you look around, one
of the tentacles wraps around you,

4281
03:39:19,353 --> 03:39:22,885
and you take 19 points of bludgeoning damage.

4282
03:39:22,885 --> 03:39:23,976
TALIESIN: Oh, god.

4283
03:39:23,976 --> 03:39:27,474
MATT: And you are grappled by the tentacle.

4284
03:39:27,474 --> 03:39:28,408
MARISHA: So glad I healed myself.

4285
03:39:28,408 --> 03:39:29,342
LAURA: Mother fuck.

4286
03:39:29,342 --> 03:39:30,233
MARISHA: 19 points.

4287
03:39:30,233 --> 03:39:31,972
SAM: What are you down to?

4288
03:39:31,972 --> 03:39:33,137
MARISHA: Seven points.

4289
03:39:33,137 --> 03:39:38,836
MATT: All right. That brings us to the next lair
action.

4290
03:39:38,836 --> 03:39:40,161
TALIESIN: God damn it.

4291
03:39:40,161 --> 03:39:44,877
MATT: Everything is still obscured in this black
inky space, by the way. Oh, you guys missed that

4292
03:39:44,877 --> 03:39:52,358
while you were away. The kraken did an ink jet and
filled this entire 60-foot radius with ink.

4293
03:39:52,358 --> 03:39:55,947
The whole area is drastically obscured.

4294
03:39:55,947 --> 03:39:59,574
MARISHA: Even though there's my Control Water
current going outward?

4295
03:39:59,574 --> 03:40:01,851
Which lasts for ten minutes!

4296
03:40:01,851 --> 03:40:05,752
MATT: Well, lasts for ten minutes while you're
concentrating, did you maintain concentration--

4297
03:40:05,752 --> 03:40:07,251
MARISHA: I haven't broke concentration--

4298
03:40:07,349 --> 03:40:07,939
MATT: That's true--

4299
03:40:07,939 --> 03:40:08,943
MARISHA: I saved for it.

4300
03:40:08,943 --> 03:40:10,209
MATT: Well, save right now.

4301
03:40:10,209 --> 03:40:12,555
MARISHA: I already saved for it while I was inside
of him. I can save again.

4302
03:40:12,555 --> 03:40:14,073
MATT: Right, but you just took damage from the--

4303
03:40:14,073 --> 03:40:15,111
TALIESIN: From the tentacles.

4304
03:40:15,111 --> 03:40:16,326
MATT: From the tentacles. However, you are
correct,

4305
03:40:16,326 --> 03:40:19,055
the water jet did clear out the ink from 
this area.

4306
03:40:19,055 --> 03:40:25,278
MARISHA: It's not terrible. My wisdom-- 19.

4307
03:40:25,278 --> 03:40:27,040
MATT: Not wisdom, plus your constitution.

4308
03:40:27,040 --> 03:40:29,353
MARISHA: Not as good.

4309
03:40:29,353 --> 03:40:30,651
LIAM: Bless!

4310
03:40:30,651 --> 03:40:38,089
MARISHA: Plus bless, which is good. Wait, what was
that?

4311
03:40:38,089 --> 03:40:38,978
TALIESIN: Three.

4312
03:40:38,978 --> 03:40:44,316
MARISHA: That was three, thank you, three. Sorry,
constitution.

4313
03:40:44,316 --> 03:40:46,577
SAM: Constitution.

4314
03:40:46,577 --> 03:40:48,701
MARISHA: 16! 16!

4315
03:40:48,804 --> 03:40:51,694
MATT: Okay, that's enough, you maintain
concentration. So yeah, so you've now cleared out

4316
03:40:51,694 --> 03:40:54,557
this section, this section is cleared of ink.
Control Water,

4317
03:40:54,557 --> 03:40:58,067
the stream you've been doing has
cleared out this area, so yeah.

4318
03:40:58,067 --> 03:40:59,366
MARISHA: Jeez, guys.

4319
03:40:59,366 --> 03:41:00,493
LAURA: Slowest math.

4320
03:41:00,493 --> 03:41:04,134
MARISHA: Gil. Gil bought us kraken.

4321
03:41:04,134 --> 03:41:05,195
MATT: All right, so--

4322
03:41:05,195 --> 03:41:06,251
MARISHA: Blame Gil.

4323
03:41:06,251 --> 03:41:07,201
LIAM: Kraken for kraken.

4324
03:41:07,201 --> 03:41:08,605
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil!

4325
03:41:08,605 --> 03:41:13,666
MATT: All right at this point, as it is now the 20
count on the lair action, the kraken once again

4326
03:41:13,666 --> 03:41:16,263
gives another pulse of electrical energy,
everything in the area,

4327
03:41:16,263 --> 03:41:23,921
I need everyone to go ahead and 
make a constitution saving throw.

4328
03:41:23,921 --> 03:41:25,209
SAM: 25!

4329
03:41:25,209 --> 03:41:26,566
MATT: All right, five points of lightning damage.

4330
03:41:26,566 --> 03:41:28,341
MARISHA: Player-killer, not great.

4331
03:41:28,341 --> 03:41:29,507
TALIESIN: 18.

4332
03:41:29,507 --> 03:41:32,678
MATT: 18? You take ten points of lightning damage.
Keyleth?

4333
03:41:32,678 --> 03:41:34,934
MARISHA: Seven.

4334
03:41:34,934 --> 03:41:36,437
MATT: Ten points of lightning damage.

4335
03:41:36,437 --> 03:41:37,480
TALIESIN: And she's out!

4336
03:41:37,480 --> 03:41:38,426
MARISHA: I'm unconscious.

4337
03:41:38,426 --> 03:41:39,721
LIAM: 19, Deathwalker's Ward

4338
03:41:39,721 --> 03:41:41,235
MATT: So five points of lightning damage.

4339
03:41:41,235 --> 03:41:43,456
MARISHA: Keyleth is unconscious.

4340
03:41:43,456 --> 03:41:46,700
TALIESIN: Just barely.

4341
03:41:46,700 --> 03:41:47,897
LAURA: 16 for me.

4342
03:41:47,897 --> 03:41:49,384
MATT: Ten points of lightning damage. Grog?

4343
03:41:49,384 --> 03:41:50,703
LAURA: And 14 for Trinket, so--

4344
03:41:50,703 --> 03:41:52,495
TRAVIS: It's a 15, but I have resistance, so--

4345
03:41:52,495 --> 03:41:53,722
MATT: So five points of lightning damage. And
Trinket was what?

4346
03:41:53,722 --> 03:41:55,628
LAURA: He is ten points.

4347
03:41:55,628 --> 03:42:00,221
MATT: Ten points, okay, so. Keyleth goes
unconscious, you watch as she just gets jettisoned

4348
03:42:00,221 --> 03:42:05,955
out and the lightning streaks through her and eyes
darken and she kinda falls limp in the water as

4349
03:42:05,955 --> 03:42:09,550
the tentacle begins to slowly draw her back to its
maw.

4350
03:42:09,550 --> 03:42:10,604
LAURA: Fuck.

4351
03:42:10,604 --> 03:42:11,421
TALIESIN: God damn it.

4352
03:42:11,421 --> 03:42:12,280
MATT: Vex, you're up.

4353
03:42:12,280 --> 03:42:17,838
LAURA: Okay. I'm gonna keep moving 
towards the lodestone and my brother.

4354
03:42:17,898 --> 03:42:21,025
LAURA: I see where it came out, right?

4355
03:42:21,125 --> 03:42:22,778
MATT: That's as close as you get right here in
this position.

4356
03:42:22,778 --> 03:42:26,730
LAURA: So can I use my-- can I get it out of the
water and put in my bag of colding?

4357
03:42:26,730 --> 03:42:31,565
MATT: You spend your action to free it and you get
it out of the water and put it into the bag of holding.

4358
03:42:31,565 --> 03:42:33,742
MARISHA: That's all three, right?

4359
03:42:33,782 --> 03:42:34,844
MATT: So you have a bag of holding?

4360
03:42:34,844 --> 03:42:35,939
LAURA: I have a bag of colding.

4361
03:42:35,939 --> 03:42:37,479
MATT: Colding? Okay, yeah, you can put it there.
It has enough space.

4362
03:42:37,479 --> 03:42:38,354
MARISHA: Three?

4363
03:42:38,354 --> 03:42:39,198
TALIESIN: We've got all three.

4364
03:42:39,198 --> 03:42:39,835
MARISHA: We have all three?

4365
03:42:39,835 --> 03:42:40,565
LAURA: Yeah.

4366
03:42:40,565 --> 03:42:42,164
MATT: You have all three lodestones currently.

4367
03:42:42,164 --> 03:42:42,897
LAURA: Okay--

4368
03:42:42,897 --> 03:42:43,760
LIAM: Is Keyleth--

4369
03:42:43,760 --> 03:42:45,566
LAURA: We're all going to die, but we have three
lodestones doing it.

4370
03:42:45,566 --> 03:42:47,409
LIAM: Is Keyleth still grappled while
unconscious?

4371
03:42:47,409 --> 03:42:48,131
TALIESIN: Yes.

4372
03:42:48,131 --> 03:42:48,970
MATT: Correct.

4373
03:42:48,970 --> 03:42:50,061
LIAM: Shit.

4374
03:42:50,061 --> 03:43:09,972
LAURA: And I guess for-- god. For my bonus action,
can I-- I don't know what to do. I'm going to

4375
03:43:09,972 --> 03:43:13,452
have-- while I'm thinking about this, I'm going to
have the shark attack him.

4376
03:43:13,452 --> 03:43:15,451
SAM: 'Cause it's shark week.

4377
03:43:15,451 --> 03:43:16,498
MATT: Okay, shark moves here.

4378
03:43:16,498 --> 03:43:17,661
TALIESIN: Bite the tentacles.

4379
03:43:17,661 --> 03:43:20,584
LAURA: The shark's gonna bite the tentacle that's
holding onto--

4380
03:43:20,584 --> 03:43:22,563
who's that right in front of him, Percy?

4381
03:43:22,563 --> 03:43:23,573
MATT: Yes.

4382
03:43:23,573 --> 03:43:24,554
LAURA: No.

4383
03:43:24,554 --> 03:43:25,658
TRAVIS: In front?

4384
03:43:25,658 --> 03:43:27,561
MATT: Right there this is Percy. This is Taryon.

4385
03:43:27,561 --> 03:43:30,752
LAURA: He's going to swim towards Percy.

4386
03:43:30,752 --> 03:43:35,751
SAM: Wait, friendly shark!

4387
03:43:35,751 --> 03:43:37,118
(all laugh)

4388
03:43:37,118 --> 03:43:38,162
MATT: Okay.

4389
03:43:38,162 --> 03:43:42,335
LAURA: And bite the tentacle to help free Percy.
And he gets advantage?

4390
03:43:42,335 --> 03:43:43,849
MATT: Correct.

4391
03:43:43,849 --> 03:43:45,416
TRAVIS: Awesome.

4392
03:43:45,416 --> 03:43:47,915
SAM: Oh, shark ally!

4393
03:43:47,915 --> 03:43:49,243
LAURA: 15? Is that enough?

4394
03:43:49,243 --> 03:43:52,539
MATT: 15. Unfortunately, it's just gnawing at it,
but it's not quite breaking through, it's tough hide.

4395
03:43:52,539 --> 03:44:00,703
LAURA: Okay. I look at my brother and say, can you
get out of this?

4396
03:44:00,703 --> 03:44:02,071
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

4397
03:44:02,071 --> 03:44:05,962
LAURA: Okay. I swim back and use my bonus action
to try to hide.

4398
03:44:05,962 --> 03:44:07,465
MATT: All right. So you swim backward this way?

4399
03:44:07,465 --> 03:44:08,284
LAURA: Yeah.

4400
03:44:08,284 --> 03:44:09,447
MATT: How far? Which direction?

4401
03:44:09,447 --> 03:44:11,007
LAURA: Towards the rock, towards the--

4402
03:44:11,007 --> 03:44:11,788
MATT: Towards the rock here?

4403
03:44:11,788 --> 03:44:13,200
LAURA: Yeah.

4404
03:44:13,200 --> 03:44:14,491
MATT: That's about as far as you can get,
unfortunately.

4405
03:44:14,491 --> 03:44:15,435
LAURA: Well, I try to hide--

4406
03:44:15,435 --> 03:44:16,909
MATT: You have Alter Self on you right? You cast
it--

4407
03:44:16,909 --> 03:44:18,139
LAURA: Yeah.

4408
03:44:18,139 --> 03:44:24,095
MATT: So you can make it. We'll say that's as far
as you can get, no reason to hide, you're still

4409
03:44:24,095 --> 03:44:26,033
out in the open, you don't have anything to hide
behind, unfortunately.

4410
03:44:26,033 --> 03:44:29,468
LAURA: Can I sit on the ground? I wanna sit on the
ground and wrap

4411
03:44:29,468 --> 03:44:32,367
my cloak around me and make myself look 
like a rock.

4412
03:44:32,367 --> 03:44:34,684
MATT: Actually, you do back up into the ink cloud,
so you can.

4413
03:44:34,684 --> 03:44:41,206
LAURA: Hey!

4414
03:44:41,206 --> 03:44:45,900
MATT: Which is not obscured to the kraken. So, you
cannot hide. He can still see you in the ink cloud.

4415
03:44:45,900 --> 03:44:46,963
LAURA: Oh really?

4416
03:44:46,963 --> 03:44:47,773
MATT: Yeah, so--

4417
03:44:47,773 --> 03:44:50,088
MARISHA: Also did my Control Water--

4418
03:44:50,088 --> 03:44:55,291
MATT: It didn't-- this whole area is filled with
ink, so you just cleared out this area here.

4419
03:44:55,291 --> 03:44:58,117
LAURA: Well then, if I can't hide from him, can I
use my bonus action to do something else?

4420
03:44:58,117 --> 03:44:58,866
MATT: Sure.

4421
03:44:58,866 --> 03:45:00,351
LAURA: Then I'm going to have Trinket attack him.

4422
03:45:00,351 --> 03:45:02,502
MATT: All right. Trinket on your turn moves up to
the back of it--

4423
03:45:02,502 --> 03:45:05,505
LAURA: He'll attack the tentacle that's holding
Tary.

4424
03:45:05,505 --> 03:45:07,081
SAM: Oh, friendly bear?

4425
03:45:07,081 --> 03:45:11,286
MATT: (bear noises)

4426
03:45:11,286 --> 03:45:13,090
LAURA: Oh, Trinket-- Trinket's grappled!

4427
03:45:13,090 --> 03:45:15,041
MATT: Oh, Trinket can't move, you're right!

4428
03:45:15,041 --> 03:45:16,891
LAURA: Trinket's going to attack the tentacle
that's holding him.

4429
03:45:16,891 --> 03:45:18,304
MATT: Yeah, Trinket can't move, right.

4430
03:45:18,304 --> 03:45:19,572
SAM: Never mind, friendly bear.

4431
03:45:19,572 --> 03:45:24,595
(all laugh)

4432
03:45:24,595 --> 03:45:26,616
LAURA: Oh two 19s, and that's a critical for
Trinket!

4433
03:45:26,616 --> 03:45:27,898
LIAM: Yeah!

4434
03:45:27,898 --> 03:45:29,987
MARISHA: Yeah Trinket!

4435
03:45:29,987 --> 03:45:36,720
TALIESIN and MARISHA: (sing victory fanfare from
Final Fantasy)

4436
03:45:36,720 --> 03:45:40,223
TALIESIN: Aren't you unconscious?

4437
03:45:40,223 --> 03:45:41,705
MARISHA: You know, they get it.

4438
03:45:41,705 --> 03:45:42,746
LAURA: That's ten!

4439
03:45:42,746 --> 03:45:46,513
MATT: Ten points of damage. Trinket just tears
with his jaws into the side. (growls)

4440
03:45:46,513 --> 03:45:47,577
LAURA: Did he get out?

4441
03:45:47,577 --> 03:45:48,360
MATT: No, he did not, I'm sorry.

4442
03:45:48,360 --> 03:45:49,754
LAURA: Damn it.

4443
03:45:49,754 --> 03:45:53,559
MATT: That ends your go, Vex. At the end of your
turn, it's going to use its third and final

4444
03:45:53,559 --> 03:45:57,479
legendary action to go ahead and attempt-- let's
see--

4445
03:45:57,569 --> 03:46:01,026
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

4446
03:46:01,026 --> 03:46:16,504
MATT: It's going to attempt to make a bash attack
against Percival and Vax. Which pushes you two

4447
03:46:16,504 --> 03:46:22,064
together. There's no way to escape it, you just
whack! Slams you both together. And you take--

4448
03:46:22,064 --> 03:46:23,555
LIAM and TALIESIN: (groans of pain)

4449
03:46:23,555 --> 03:46:25,814
MATT: You take 13 points of bludgeoning damage,
both of you.

4450
03:46:25,814 --> 03:46:29,796
TALIESIN: Okay.

4451
03:46:29,796 --> 03:46:34,066
MATT: All righty, that ends that. Percival,
you're up.

4452
03:46:34,167 --> 03:46:44,662
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to--

4453
03:46:44,662 --> 03:46:46,750
LIAM: Don't do that, Marisha.

4454
03:46:46,834 --> 03:46:50,585
TALIESIN: Hm? I know, she's making us feel really
guilty right now. I'm going to hack away at this

4455
03:46:50,585 --> 03:46:53,151
thing right now, so I'm going to try and hack away
at this tentacle to get out.

4456
03:46:53,151 --> 03:46:54,521
MATT: Okay.

4457
03:46:54,521 --> 03:46:55,804
TALIESIN: Disadvantage, correct?

4458
03:46:55,804 --> 03:46:57,170
MATT: Correct.

4459
03:46:57,170 --> 03:47:01,789
TALIESIN: God, I'm really not enjoying this.
That's a 17.

4460
03:47:01,789 --> 03:47:06,860
MATT: 17 does not hit. The first one you can't
quite get your arms free, and you swing--

4461
03:47:06,860 --> 03:47:09,847
you just barely-- carves like a centimeter 
into the creature's flesh.

4462
03:47:09,847 --> 03:47:14,572
TALIESIN: 19?

4463
03:47:14,572 --> 03:47:16,581
MATT: 19 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

4464
03:47:16,581 --> 03:47:18,418
TALIESIN: I know that natural 20 is just going
to waste.

4465
03:47:18,418 --> 03:47:23,666
MARISHA: It's so close, I know. That's good,
though.

4466
03:47:23,767 --> 03:47:24,710
TALIESIN: 13.

4467
03:47:24,710 --> 03:47:25,840
MARISHA: Yeah?

4468
03:47:25,840 --> 03:47:27,756
MATT: 13 points of damage.

4469
03:47:27,756 --> 03:47:34,841
TALIESIN: And I'll take another one, that's not
going to roll well, here we go. My third hit is 16.

4470
03:47:34,841 --> 03:47:36,930
MATT: 16 does not hit, unfortunately.

4471
03:47:36,930 --> 03:47:42,540
TALIESIN: So I'm going to burn my Action Surge and
I'm going to take the Alter Self.

4472
03:47:42,669 --> 03:47:47,421
That coin you gave me is--

4473
03:47:47,421 --> 03:47:49,533
MATT: Takes an action to do so.

4474
03:47:49,533 --> 03:47:52,061
TALIESIN: What does it give me, just full
movement?

4475
03:47:52,061 --> 03:47:53,223
SAM: Gills and full movement.

4476
03:47:53,223 --> 03:47:59,169
MARISHA: It allows you to alter yourself based on
what you chose, which is give you gills and fins--

4477
03:47:59,169 --> 03:48:02,528
MATT: Yeah, in this circumstance the best bet you
want to have is gills and fins. So you can swim.

4478
03:48:02,528 --> 03:48:04,972
MARISHA: Within moderation.

4479
03:48:04,972 --> 03:48:08,283
TALIESIN: Yeah, so I burn my Action Surge for
that.

4480
03:48:08,283 --> 03:48:10,421
MATT: Okay, so your Alter Self is in.

4481
03:48:10,421 --> 03:48:20,335
TALIESIN: I'm going to go find my healing potions
to find out what I have,

4482
03:48:20,335 --> 03:48:24,243
but I'm going to do that-- yep, moving right along.

4483
03:48:24,330 --> 03:48:25,960
MATT: That ends your turn, Percy?

4484
03:48:25,960 --> 03:48:26,814
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4485
03:48:26,814 --> 03:48:29,875
MATT: That brings us to the kraken. Legendary
actions return.

4486
03:48:30,013 --> 03:48:33,786
TALIESIN: Fuck.

4487
03:48:33,786 --> 03:48:45,319
MATT: Kraken is going to shift around up and over
there. So we'll say for the purposes of this--

4488
03:48:45,319 --> 03:48:48,970
TALIESIN: We really need to leave badly.

4489
03:48:48,970 --> 03:48:50,513
SAM: Does the shark get an attack?

4490
03:48:50,513 --> 03:48:52,444
LAURA: Is the kraken an animal?

4491
03:48:52,444 --> 03:48:54,046
MATT: Not quite.

4492
03:48:54,046 --> 03:48:54,892
TALIESIN: No?

4493
03:48:54,892 --> 03:48:55,967
LIAM: Monstrosity.

4494
03:48:55,967 --> 03:48:59,322
MATT: Going to curl over the top there, Trinket
does get an attack of opportunity.

4495
03:48:59,322 --> 03:49:00,747
TRAVIS: Does Grog?

4496
03:49:00,747 --> 03:49:04,493
MATT: No because it just moves into the space
between you and Keyleth.

4497
03:49:04,493 --> 03:49:06,067
SAM: Laura, attack!

4498
03:49:06,067 --> 03:49:07,187
TALIESIN: Does the shark?

4499
03:49:07,187 --> 03:49:08,748
SAM: Laura! Trinket!

4500
03:49:08,748 --> 03:49:10,206
MATT: The shark does not--

4501
03:49:10,206 --> 03:49:12,496
TRAVIS: He's grappled. Trinket's grappled.

4502
03:49:12,496 --> 03:49:14,061
SAM: Yeah, but can still attack.

4503
03:49:14,061 --> 03:49:20,408
MATT: Yeah, 'cause the shark was attacking Percy's
tentacle, so it was not in reach to attack the creature.

4504
03:49:20,408 --> 03:49:23,385
LAURA: Was Trinket within range for a (chomps).

4505
03:49:23,626 --> 03:49:27,917
MATT: Trinket was not. He already moved before,
'cause Trinket was grappled before he could get

4506
03:49:27,917 --> 03:49:40,199
into space with it. All right, it is going to use
its Lightning Storm. So I need four bolts of

4507
03:49:40,301 --> 03:49:47,246
lightning. That's going to be against-- That's
going to be

4508
03:49:47,246 --> 03:50:04,943
Vex, Taryon, Percival, and we'll say Vax. 
Dexterity saving throws, you guys.

4509
03:50:04,943 --> 03:50:07,977
SAM: You said something earlier about dexterity
saving throws?

4510
03:50:07,977 --> 03:50:09,514
MATT: At disadvantage.

4511
03:50:09,514 --> 03:50:10,496
TALIESIN: At disadvantage?

4512
03:50:10,496 --> 03:50:11,299
MATT: Yes.

4513
03:50:11,299 --> 03:50:13,089
LAURA: Only if you're grappled.

4514
03:50:13,089 --> 03:50:14,885
MATT: If you're grappled.

4515
03:50:14,885 --> 03:50:15,943
LAURA: Yeah.

4516
03:50:15,943 --> 03:50:20,324
SAM: Five.

4517
03:50:20,324 --> 03:50:22,397
TALIESIN: 15.

4518
03:50:22,397 --> 03:50:23,462
LIAM: 16.

4519
03:50:23,462 --> 03:50:25,510
LAURA: 29.

4520
03:50:25,510 --> 03:50:26,693
MATT: So, hold on, was that five?

4521
03:50:26,693 --> 03:50:27,551
SAM: Yes.

4522
03:50:27,551 --> 03:50:30,267
MATT: 25 points lightning damage. Percival?

4523
03:50:30,267 --> 03:50:31,227
TALIESIN: 15.

4524
03:50:31,227 --> 03:50:32,675
MATT: 15? 25 points of lightning damage.

4525
03:50:32,675 --> 03:50:34,691
LIAM: 16 and Deathwalker's Ward.

4526
03:50:34,691 --> 03:50:39,573
MATT: So 25 reduced to half. 13 points of damage.

4527
03:50:39,573 --> 03:50:40,567
LAURA: 29.

4528
03:50:40,567 --> 03:50:46,250
MATT: 29? You take 13 points of lightning damage.

4529
03:50:46,250 --> 03:50:54,776
LIAM: Oh, and if I fail dex saves it's half
damage, so I'm getting quarter damage right now.

4530
03:50:54,776 --> 03:50:57,103
MATT: Well, it's Evasion, so if it's half you do
nothing.

4531
03:50:57,103 --> 03:51:00,385
LIAM: If I succeed, it's nothing. If I fail--

4532
03:51:00,385 --> 03:51:01,145
LAURA: But you're grappled.

4533
03:51:01,145 --> 03:51:02,360
LIAM: I failed, it's halved.

4534
03:51:02,360 --> 03:51:03,893
MATT: You failed, so it's halved, so yeah, you
take a quarter.

4535
03:51:03,893 --> 03:51:05,188
LIAM: Plus the Deathwalker's, so down and down.

4536
03:51:05,188 --> 03:51:07,765
MATT: Right, I got confused, so yes. So half that
as well.

4537
03:51:07,765 --> 03:51:11,027
All right, that ends the kraken's turn. 
Grog, you're up.

4538
03:51:11,027 --> 03:51:14,121
TRAVIS: Ha! Ha! Am I near Keyleth?

4539
03:51:14,226 --> 03:51:15,677
MATT: You are right next to Keyleth.

4540
03:51:15,677 --> 03:51:21,151
TRAVIS: Great! I'm going to use my action to shove
a greater healing potion

4541
03:51:21,151 --> 03:51:24,535
in your stupid unconscious mouth.

4542
03:51:24,535 --> 03:51:27,211
(all laugh)

4543
03:51:27,211 --> 03:51:33,471
MATT: All right, so that is 4d4 plus four.

4544
03:51:33,471 --> 03:51:34,899
TRAVIS: I roll that?

4545
03:51:34,899 --> 03:51:37,398
LAURA: You want some more d4s?

4546
03:51:37,398 --> 03:51:38,646
TRAVIS: No.

4547
03:51:38,646 --> 03:51:39,527
LAURA: Okay.

4548
03:51:39,527 --> 03:51:40,881
TALIESIN: 4d4.

4549
03:51:40,881 --> 03:51:41,745
TRAVIS: Great.

4550
03:51:41,745 --> 03:51:42,681
LAURA: Yeah!

4551
03:51:42,681 --> 03:51:47,900
TRAVIS: Four, six, eight, 12!

4552
03:51:47,900 --> 03:51:49,237
MARISHA: Healing points?

4553
03:51:49,237 --> 03:51:52,056
MATT: Mm-hm. You get 12.

4554
03:51:52,056 --> 03:51:52,817
LIAM: That's a number.

4555
03:51:52,817 --> 03:51:53,772
MARISHA: I get 12.

4556
03:51:53,772 --> 03:51:57,495
MATT: Grog, you still have your bonus action. You
are frenzied and you have your movement.

4557
03:51:57,495 --> 03:52:05,089
TRAVIS: I do! I want to (doop doop doop) like Mario
in the water world, and I want to go up on top of

4558
03:52:05,194 --> 03:52:12,653
the kraken's face, and I want to punch him in his
stupid big eyeball with the dwarven thrower.

4559
03:52:12,653 --> 03:52:15,001
MATT: Okay, so you come up onto the actual--

4560
03:52:15,001 --> 03:52:15,933
TRAVIS: Yep.

4561
03:52:15,933 --> 03:52:17,507
MATT: -- kraken, okay.

4562
03:52:17,507 --> 03:52:19,063
LIAM: Madman, love it.

4563
03:52:19,063 --> 03:52:23,705
MATT: So you're right there. Okay, so go ahead and
make your attack.

4564
03:52:23,705 --> 03:52:25,879
TRAVIS: Reckless!

4565
03:52:25,879 --> 03:52:27,160
MATT: So just a single roll.

4566
03:52:27,160 --> 03:52:29,513
TRAVIS: Yep. 28.

4567
03:52:29,513 --> 03:52:31,512
MATT: 28 hits! Roll damage.

4568
03:52:31,512 --> 03:52:33,613
LAURA: Eyeball death!

4569
03:52:33,691 --> 03:52:38,249
TRAVIS: That's 14, 25. 25!

4570
03:52:38,249 --> 03:52:38,862
MATT: 35--

4571
03:52:38,862 --> 03:52:39,878
TRAVIS: 25.

4572
03:52:39,878 --> 03:52:45,551
MATT: 25 points of damage. You just, whack!, bash
it in the side of its face. (growls)

4573
03:52:45,551 --> 03:52:47,363
TRAVIS: Eyeball took it pretty well, man, jeez.

4574
03:52:47,363 --> 03:52:48,372
MATT: Yep.

4575
03:52:48,372 --> 03:52:50,961
TRAVIS: Those eyeballs are hard.

4576
03:52:50,961 --> 03:52:52,497
MATT: That ends your turn, Grog?

4577
03:52:52,736 --> 03:52:53,784
TRAVIS: It does.

4578
03:52:53,784 --> 03:52:54,895
MATT: All right, Taryon.

4579
03:52:54,895 --> 03:52:56,235
SAM: I mean, we're just trying to leave at this
point.

4580
03:52:56,235 --> 03:52:57,513
LAURA: Yeah, we're just trying to get away.

4581
03:52:57,513 --> 03:52:58,436
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

4582
03:52:58,436 --> 03:52:59,612
TALIESIN: Yeah we're running, running.

4583
03:52:59,612 --> 03:53:03,214
SAM: So I will once again try my acid trick, and
this time try to hit it

4584
03:53:03,214 --> 03:53:07,372
and pull another bottle out and smash it 
on the tentacle.

4585
03:53:07,372 --> 03:53:10,535
MATT: Okay.

4586
03:53:10,535 --> 03:53:16,127
SAM: Oh, where'd it go? That's shitty. So I'll use
Luck. Oh, better.

4587
03:53:16,127 --> 03:53:16,835
TALIESIN: Better.

4588
03:53:16,835 --> 03:53:17,763
SAM: 20.

4589
03:53:17,763 --> 03:53:20,974
MATT: 20 does hit, roll damage.

4590
03:53:20,974 --> 03:53:23,013
SAM: It's 7d6, right?

4591
03:53:23,013 --> 03:53:25,045
LAURA: Whoa.

4592
03:53:25,045 --> 03:53:34,510
SAM: 22.

4593
03:53:34,510 --> 03:53:40,572
MATT: 22 points of damage. As you slam it and it
begins to dissolve it, it is not enough to break

4594
03:53:40,572 --> 03:53:44,812
free but it is fairly hurt and still holding onto
you.

4595
03:53:44,812 --> 03:53:52,645
SAM: All right, for my bonus action I just say,
oh, friendly shark!

4596
03:53:52,645 --> 03:53:54,035
(all laugh)

4597
03:53:54,035 --> 03:54:00,291
SAM: I could use a bite over here! My animal
handling is negative one, by the way.

4598
03:54:00,291 --> 03:54:02,027
(all laugh)

4599
03:54:02,027 --> 03:54:04,679
MATT: Good to know. All right, Taryon, that's your
turn. Vax, you're up.

4600
03:54:04,679 --> 03:54:08,934
LIAM: Okay, I take Whisper out, and I'm throwing
it at the ground ten feet away from you right next

4601
03:54:08,934 --> 03:54:12,106
to Keyleth on the ground, and bamfing out of its
tentacle to it.

4602
03:54:12,106 --> 03:54:14,288
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll attack with
disadvantage

4603
03:54:14,288 --> 03:54:16,295
just to see it doesn't get caught in the 
water and float away.

4604
03:54:16,295 --> 03:54:19,846
LIAM: (gurgling noise) 23.

4605
03:54:19,846 --> 03:54:21,845
MATT: Yeah, it's just enough strength for you to
chuck it and

4606
03:54:21,845 --> 03:54:25,146
(swoosh) hits the sand right next to
her. You are no longer restrained--

4607
03:54:25,146 --> 03:54:27,915
LAURA: Yeah! Oh, what a clutch fucking vestige.

4608
03:54:27,915 --> 03:54:29,567
MATT: You are next to Keyleth.

4609
03:54:29,567 --> 03:54:31,133
LIAM: Plus Grog is whaling on its head, so I'm
going to

4610
03:54:31,133 --> 03:54:33,656
Sneak Attack the tentacle that's holding
Keyleth. Yeah?

4611
03:54:33,656 --> 03:54:34,524
MATT: Yeah.

4612
03:54:34,524 --> 03:54:39,433
TRAVIS: I am whaling on its head.

4613
03:54:39,543 --> 03:54:44,803
SAM: Right now, somewhere in the world, Scanlan is
eating a like calamari and going--

4614
03:54:44,803 --> 03:54:49,109
(all laugh)

4615
03:54:49,109 --> 03:54:50,104
MARISHA: Gets a little bit of a nosebleed.

4616
03:54:50,104 --> 03:54:51,029
MATT: Basically yes.

4617
03:54:51,029 --> 03:54:52,249
MARISHA: Not sure why.

4618
03:54:52,249 --> 03:54:56,429
SAM: Huh, that's weird. Little acidy there.

4619
03:54:56,429 --> 03:54:58,750
LAURA: Would have been great if Scanlan were here
just to like Dominate Creature.

4620
03:54:58,750 --> 03:54:59,793
LIAM: 34.

4621
03:54:59,793 --> 03:55:01,068
MATT: 34.

4622
03:55:01,068 --> 03:55:02,598
MARISHA: All that inspiration.

4623
03:55:02,598 --> 03:55:08,377
MATT: With that, the tentacle holding Keyleth is
torn asunder. You, using your dagger to cut her

4624
03:55:08,377 --> 03:55:16,218
free, and the cloud of blood left behind, and
withdraws, she is freed.

4625
03:55:16,218 --> 03:55:23,843
LIAM: Okay, and I will-- I can't use a bonus
action to pull her, right, that's too much, yeah?

4626
03:55:23,843 --> 03:55:25,290
MATT: Yeah.

4627
03:55:25,290 --> 03:55:29,139
LIAM: Yeah. I will use a bonus action to stand
over and in front of her.

4628
03:55:29,139 --> 03:55:30,561
SAM: So brave!

4629
03:55:30,561 --> 03:55:32,525
TALIESIN: Water wings.

4630
03:55:32,525 --> 03:55:34,392
MATT: All right, that brings us to Keyleth.

4631
03:55:34,392 --> 03:55:35,648
LAURA: Don't get swallowed.

4632
03:55:35,648 --> 03:55:38,115
MATT: Keyleth, you are freed from the tentacle,and
you are conscious, but up above you as you look up

4633
03:55:38,115 --> 03:55:44,228
into space you can see the giant kraken maybe ten,
15 feet away from you. Grog is slamming in the

4634
03:55:44,228 --> 03:55:49,824
side of its head and Vax is right there looking
over you right now.

4635
03:55:49,824 --> 03:56:03,332
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm just like a poodle over a pool
right now, just doggy paddling instinctually.

4636
03:56:03,332 --> 03:56:04,990
Do we have the lodestones, do we have all of them?

4637
03:56:04,990 --> 03:56:07,164
TALIESIN: Yes! Yes!

4638
03:56:07,164 --> 03:56:08,543
LAURA: Get us out of here!

4639
03:56:08,543 --> 03:56:09,600
LIAM: While you were out.

4640
03:56:09,600 --> 03:56:11,330
SAM: You and your fucking lodestones!

4641
03:56:11,330 --> 03:56:28,358
MARISHA: And I do Animal Shapes and I turn all of
us to-- who's grappled? A lot of us. Right?

4642
03:56:28,358 --> 03:56:29,396
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4643
03:56:29,396 --> 03:56:33,807
MATT: Yeah, Trinket, Taryon, and Percy are
currently grappled.

4644
03:56:33,807 --> 03:56:41,437
MARISHA: I'm going to turn us into like little
electric eels.

4645
03:56:41,437 --> 03:56:46,110
Maybe it's because we made that joke earlier, 
I don't know.

4646
03:56:46,110 --> 03:56:47,096
MATT: Okay.

4647
03:56:47,096 --> 03:56:51,169
MARISHA: Is that bad? Is that bad?

4648
03:56:51,169 --> 03:56:53,357
MATT: No, what do you wanna do?

4649
03:56:53,357 --> 03:56:56,138
MARISHA: I just want something that is going to
swim fast and then we all--

4650
03:56:56,138 --> 03:56:57,512
LAURA: And we slip out of its grasp.

4651
03:56:57,512 --> 03:57:08,406
MARISHA: Swim. We slip out of its grasp and swim
to the portal. To the portal! And we go.

4652
03:57:08,406 --> 03:57:11,235
MATT: Don't have rules for eels.

4653
03:57:11,235 --> 03:57:13,603
SAM: There's a water snake in there.

4654
03:57:13,603 --> 03:57:18,250
MARISHA: There is a water snake, which is kinda
what I'm basing this off of.

4655
03:57:18,250 --> 03:57:20,018
MATT: We'll use that.

4656
03:57:20,018 --> 03:57:21,608
MARISHA: The giant constrictor snake--

4657
03:57:21,608 --> 03:57:23,296
LAURA: (laughs) He loves looking up animals.

4658
03:57:23,296 --> 03:57:30,077
MARISHA: Has blindsight-- ugh.

4659
03:57:30,077 --> 03:57:33,708
SAM: They can swim really fast, and I know because
I tried to turn into one when we were in the

4660
03:57:33,708 --> 03:57:40,874
dragon. They have like a 40 swimming speed or
something.

4661
03:57:40,874 --> 03:57:44,116
MATT: Saying a giant constrictor snake has a swim
speed of 30 feet, that's the same speed as--

4662
03:57:44,116 --> 03:57:45,762
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Normal?

4663
03:57:45,762 --> 03:57:48,581
LAURA: I don't wanna be a giant constrictor snake.
We wanna be teeny ones, or little ones.

4664
03:57:48,581 --> 03:57:50,228
TALIESIN: No, it would be a normal, or like a
swimming creature,

4665
03:57:50,228 --> 03:57:52,620
though, what's the speed of a swimming creature?

4666
03:57:52,620 --> 03:57:54,358
MATT: Make your choice, Keyleth.

4667
03:57:54,358 --> 03:57:56,689
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

4668
03:57:56,689 --> 03:57:59,082
MATT: Most snakes are 30-foot swim speed.

4669
03:57:59,082 --> 03:58:06,433
MARISHA: Most are and hunter sharks are 40-foot
swim speed, killer whales are 60-foot swim speed--

4670
03:58:06,433 --> 03:58:07,693
LAURA: So make us killer whales.

4671
03:58:07,693 --> 03:58:16,673
MARISHA: But they're bigger motherfuckers, so can
we do a giant eel that's got a swim speed of 40 feet?

4672
03:58:16,673 --> 03:58:20,089
SAM: Young sea serpent that can swim 60
feet?

4673
03:58:20,089 --> 03:58:21,267
LAURA: Yeah, that!

4674
03:58:21,267 --> 03:58:23,561
MARISHA: Ooh I wanna be that!

4675
03:58:23,561 --> 03:58:24,732
TALIESIN: Thea Therpent.

4676
03:58:24,732 --> 03:58:26,026
MATT: Sea Serpent.

4677
03:58:26,026 --> 03:58:27,089
SAM: I don't know what that is.

4678
03:58:27,089 --> 03:58:28,546
TALIESIN: (lisp) Help me, Cecil, help!

4679
03:58:28,546 --> 03:58:30,219
SAM: Oh no, that's huge, that's a huge
monstrosity, she can't do that.

4680
03:58:30,219 --> 03:58:31,356
MATT: Monstrosity you can't do.

4681
03:58:31,356 --> 03:58:32,962
SAM: Can't do that, no.

4682
03:58:32,962 --> 03:58:34,170
MATT: What are you doing?

4683
03:58:34,170 --> 03:58:35,782
LIAM: Killer whale, man, killer whale.

4684
03:58:35,782 --> 03:58:39,214
MARISHA: Look, I'm bound by what the Player's
Handbook gave me! So--

4685
03:58:39,214 --> 03:58:40,538
TALIESIN: Let's go whale.

4686
03:58:40,538 --> 03:58:41,499
MARISHA: So I'll go--

4687
03:58:41,499 --> 03:58:43,284
MATT: These are creatures you would know.

4688
03:58:43,284 --> 03:58:46,622
MARISHA: Ah, fuck, whales are fucking big, though!

4689
03:58:46,622 --> 03:58:47,259
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4690
03:58:47,259 --> 03:58:48,048
MATT: Yeah.

4691
03:58:48,048 --> 03:58:49,014
MARISHA: Whales are big.

4692
03:58:49,014 --> 03:58:49,803
MATT: Yeah.

4693
03:58:49,803 --> 03:58:56,716
MARISHA: So I'll be eels with a swim speed of 40
feet? So we can slip out?

4694
03:58:56,716 --> 03:58:58,527
MATT: What creature are you choosing is my
question.

4695
03:58:58,527 --> 03:59:02,784
MARISHA: Well, that's going off of a snake speed.

4696
03:59:02,784 --> 03:59:08,591
MATT: Snake-- I'm sorry, you need to pick a
creature, you can't make up statistics here.

4697
03:59:08,591 --> 03:59:13,296
Let's see here. So.

4698
03:59:13,296 --> 03:59:15,661
LAURA: What are you reading, what are you reading,
Marisha?

4699
03:59:15,661 --> 03:59:18,220
TALIESIN: The giant snake is a land snake is the
problem.

4700
03:59:18,220 --> 03:59:19,698
MARISHA: It's a land snake.

4701
03:59:19,698 --> 03:59:21,471
TALIESIN: Let's be whales.

4702
03:59:21,471 --> 03:59:22,874
LIAM: Be whales, get the fuck out of here.

4703
03:59:22,874 --> 03:59:23,946
LAURA: It still can hold us.

4704
03:59:23,946 --> 03:59:26,398
MARISHA: Okay, but whales are 60 feet, sharks are
40 feet. That's our problem.

4705
03:59:26,398 --> 03:59:28,201
MATT: Most snakes I'm seeing here have 30 feet
swim speed.

4706
03:59:28,201 --> 03:59:31,595
LAURA: Then I think snake is probably better to
wiggle out, that's the thing.

4707
03:59:31,595 --> 03:59:32,567
MARISHA: Yeah.

4708
03:59:32,567 --> 03:59:34,691
LAURA: He's going to be able to hold whales
maybe.

4709
03:59:34,691 --> 03:59:35,455
LIAM: Okay.

4710
03:59:35,455 --> 03:59:37,310
LAURA: I don't know. I don't know! I don't know.

4711
03:59:37,310 --> 03:59:40,188
MARISHA: We'd be slow to be snakes, but more
possibly--

4712
03:59:40,188 --> 03:59:41,522
TRAVIS: It's your Aramente. It's your Aramente.

4713
03:59:41,522 --> 03:59:42,801
TALIESIN and LAURA: It's your Aramente.

4714
03:59:42,801 --> 03:59:44,429
MATT: What are you doing, as you're casting your
spell. It's your Aramente.

4715
03:59:44,429 --> 03:59:46,392
What are you choosing? What form?

4716
03:59:46,392 --> 03:59:50,069
MARISHA: (yells) We're going to be eels! That's
what I said at first!

4717
03:59:50,069 --> 03:59:50,919
LIAM: Eels, we're eels.

4718
03:59:50,919 --> 03:59:52,891
MARISHA: Swim, 30 foot!

4719
03:59:52,891 --> 03:59:53,779
LIAM: Eels.

4720
03:59:53,779 --> 03:59:55,303
MATT: Okay, eels, we're using the statistics for a
snake.

4721
03:59:55,303 --> 04:00:01,302
MARISHA: I wanna use a statistic for a snake, but
swim speed, fuck! I'm trying to be elusive here!

4722
04:00:01,302 --> 04:00:03,520
MATT: All right.

4723
04:00:03,520 --> 04:00:04,476
MARISHA: Fuck.

4724
04:00:04,476 --> 04:00:05,941
MATT: I-- whatever. Fine.

4725
04:00:05,941 --> 04:00:08,222
SAM: We'll do it live!

4726
04:00:08,222 --> 04:00:09,158
TALIESIN: We'll do it live!

4727
04:00:09,158 --> 04:00:12,647
MATT: You are all water snakes. You're majestic,
ten-hit-point forms as water snakes.

4728
04:00:12,647 --> 04:00:15,707
You all suddenly transform--

4729
04:00:15,707 --> 04:00:16,547
TALIESIN: Mine has glasses.

4730
04:00:16,547 --> 04:00:17,645
MATT: -- into these tiny snakes.

4731
04:00:17,645 --> 04:00:18,845
MARISHA: Go, go, go, go.

4732
04:00:18,845 --> 04:00:22,566
MATT: We'll say for the current purposes of this,
until it comes to the kraken's turn, everyone who

4733
04:00:22,566 --> 04:00:27,184
is currently grappled is not grappled, because you
are a smaller form. Until the kraken's turn.

4734
04:00:27,184 --> 04:00:28,025
SAM: Ooh.

4735
04:00:28,025 --> 04:00:29,092
MARISHA: Oh, god.

4736
04:00:29,092 --> 04:00:31,030
MATT: So we'll have to see whose turn order is
what.

4737
04:00:31,030 --> 04:00:32,690
LAURA: And we all just book it.

4738
04:00:32,690 --> 04:00:34,465
MATT: All right, so--

4739
04:00:34,465 --> 04:00:36,544
MARISHA: Double movement.

4740
04:00:36,544 --> 04:00:44,514
MATT: That brings us next to the initiative
counter 20. So. I need all of you guys, as snakes,

4741
04:00:44,514 --> 04:00:48,679
to make constitution saving throws.

4742
04:00:48,679 --> 04:00:51,920
LAURA: We're all just gonna bamf back to-- but at
least, hey, we're ungrappled.

4743
04:00:51,920 --> 04:00:53,029
SAM: Matt. We're eels.

4744
04:00:53,029 --> 04:00:53,780
MARISHA: I don't know what that did.

4745
04:00:53,780 --> 04:00:54,751
MATT: I know.

4746
04:00:54,751 --> 04:00:55,521
SAM: Eels.

4747
04:00:55,521 --> 04:00:56,379
TALIESIN: Wait.

4748
04:00:56,379 --> 04:00:57,325
SAM: Hey! I did pretty good.

4749
04:00:57,325 --> 04:00:58,500
TALIESIN: Electric eels-- if they're electric
eels--

4750
04:00:58,500 --> 04:01:00,038
MARISHA: I did okay. And we're still blessed.

4751
04:01:00,038 --> 04:01:01,085
TRAVIS: And we still are blessed, right?

4752
04:01:01,085 --> 04:01:02,291
TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw?

4753
04:01:02,291 --> 04:01:03,397
LIAM: Keyleth is not. You are, and I am.

4754
04:01:03,397 --> 04:01:04,858
MATT: You did choose electric eels.

4755
04:01:04,858 --> 04:01:05,665
LAURA: Oh!

4756
04:01:05,665 --> 04:01:06,702
MARISHA: Okay, that went off the rails.

4757
04:01:06,702 --> 04:01:07,873
MATT: Which--

4758
04:01:07,873 --> 04:01:09,407
MARISHA: That's not bad.

4759
04:01:09,407 --> 04:01:10,467
TALIESIN: Aha!

4760
04:01:10,467 --> 04:01:11,625
MARISHA: Okay, okay--

4761
04:01:11,625 --> 04:01:12,869
MATT: No, hold on.

4762
04:01:12,869 --> 04:01:14,129
TRAVIS: Hold on.

4763
04:01:14,129 --> 04:01:15,263
LIAM: We gots to be immune, man.

4764
04:01:15,263 --> 04:01:17,025
LAURA: What are we doing?

4765
04:01:17,025 --> 04:01:19,155
MATT: I know. Because you chose eels--

4766
04:01:19,155 --> 04:01:20,041
LIAM: Winging it.

4767
04:01:20,041 --> 04:01:23,234
MATT: -- the electricity has no effect.

4768
04:01:23,234 --> 04:01:25,624
TALIESIN: Ah!

4769
04:01:25,624 --> 04:01:28,387
SAM: Matt hates everything right now.

4770
04:01:28,387 --> 04:01:30,588
MATT: Weirdly--

4771
04:01:30,588 --> 04:01:31,567
MARISHA: What?

4772
04:01:31,567 --> 04:01:33,977
MATT: -- this worked to your advantage for the 20
initiative count.

4773
04:01:33,977 --> 04:01:34,940
LAURA: Ah.

4774
04:01:34,940 --> 04:01:36,187
MARISHA: (sings) Shocking like electric eels.

4775
04:01:36,187 --> 04:01:40,188
MATT: So as the pulse of electric energy shoots
out from the kraken, it shocks around and through

4776
04:01:40,188 --> 04:01:44,508
all of you, but your physical eel forms take no
damage.

4777
04:01:44,508 --> 04:01:45,652
LIAM: Feels good!

4778
04:01:45,652 --> 04:01:47,666
MATT: As they're used to conducting energy.

4779
04:01:47,770 --> 04:01:48,450
TALIESIN: Ah!

4780
04:01:48,450 --> 04:01:49,763
MARISHA: Sweet!

4781
04:01:49,763 --> 04:01:50,560
MATT: Vex.

4782
04:01:50,560 --> 04:01:51,262
LAURA: Yeah?

4783
04:01:51,262 --> 04:01:52,515
SAM: (sings) Can't stop the eeling!

4784
04:01:52,515 --> 04:01:53,356
MATT: Your turn.

4785
04:01:53,356 --> 04:02:01,011
LAURA: As an eel, I'm gonna swim around the big
brown rock, away from the kraken, towards the door.

4786
04:02:01,135 --> 04:02:03,634
MATT: 30. And you're gonna use your action to
dash, as well?

4787
04:02:03,634 --> 04:02:04,744
LAURA: Yes.

4788
04:02:04,744 --> 04:02:13,787
MATT: That's as far as you can get. All right,
finishing Vex's turn. All righty.

4789
04:02:13,787 --> 04:02:18,801
LAURA: I feel like I'm just leaving everybody
behind-- oh, and Trinket's gonna do the same thing.

4790
04:02:18,801 --> 04:02:21,260
MARISHA: No, run, run, run. Get out, get out, get
out.

4791
04:02:21,260 --> 04:02:22,531
LIAM: But only because you are.

4792
04:02:22,531 --> 04:02:25,180
MATT: That's as far as Trinket can go, there.

4793
04:02:25,180 --> 04:02:29,044
LAURA: Can he use his double action to do the same
thing?

4794
04:02:29,044 --> 04:02:30,231
MATT: He doesn't have a double action.

4795
04:02:30,231 --> 04:02:31,042
LAURA: Just kidding.

4796
04:02:31,042 --> 04:02:31,994
MATT: He moves in your turn.

4797
04:02:31,994 --> 04:02:37,710
LAURA: But I am gonna make my shark attack him!
The shark's gonna just swim up in his face.

4798
04:02:37,710 --> 04:02:39,248
TALIESIN: What is happening?

4799
04:02:39,248 --> 04:02:44,716
LAURA: Swim up in his eyeball, and just be like,
wah, look at me, I'm--

4800
04:02:44,716 --> 04:02:45,751
MATT: Roll an attack for your shark.

4801
04:02:45,751 --> 04:02:46,595
LAURA: I'm a shark!

4802
04:02:46,595 --> 04:02:48,307
LIAM: Who hasn't gotten punchy at the end of a
long D&amp;D game?

4803
04:02:48,307 --> 04:02:51,983
TALIESIN: I-- man, nothing makes sense anymore.

4804
04:02:51,983 --> 04:02:53,163
LIAM: This is real D&amp;D.

4805
04:02:53,163 --> 04:02:54,652
LAURA: 21.

4806
04:02:54,652 --> 04:02:56,415
MATT: 21 hits. Roll damage.

4807
04:02:56,415 --> 04:02:57,496
LAURA: Yes!

4808
04:02:57,496 --> 04:02:58,679
TALIESIN: Good shark.

4809
04:02:58,679 --> 04:03:00,672
LAURA: Okay, that's a bite attack, that is--

4810
04:03:00,672 --> 04:03:02,439
LIAM: You went British again.

4811
04:03:02,439 --> 04:03:05,101
LAURA: Okay, wait-- oh, that's more than that!
Anyway.

4812
04:03:05,101 --> 04:03:09,145
TALIESIN: I figure since I'm an eel, I'm gonna
attack this thing.

4813
04:03:09,145 --> 04:03:10,298
LAURA: 12.

4814
04:03:10,298 --> 04:03:11,488
TALIESIN: I think I've got a shot.

4815
04:03:11,488 --> 04:03:14,643
MATT: All right. 12 points of damage to the
kraken. Gotcha. All righty.

4816
04:03:14,643 --> 04:03:16,509
TALIESIN: Ahaha. Sorry.

4817
04:03:16,509 --> 04:03:22,597
MATT: It's gonna go ahead and use Lightning Storm,
costing 2 of its actions. It's going to focus this on--

4818
04:03:22,597 --> 04:03:23,666
LIAM: Stupid kraken.

4819
04:03:23,666 --> 04:03:34,160
MATT: -- Taryon, Grog, and-- because you were the
source of its magic and it is horribly frustrated,

4820
04:03:34,160 --> 04:03:37,290
Keyleth. I need the three of you guys--

4821
04:03:37,290 --> 04:03:40,263
oh fuck, it's Lightning Storm, it's not--
you're all eels, what am I doing?

4822
04:03:40,263 --> 04:03:43,765
MARISHA: Electric eels. We are electric eels.

4823
04:03:43,765 --> 04:03:44,995
LIAM: Oh, no.

4824
04:03:44,995 --> 04:03:46,639
SAM: Oh, Matt hates us.

4825
04:03:46,639 --> 04:03:49,199
MATT: I'm-- it's been a long week, and I keep
forgetting my fucking shit. It's okay.

4826
04:03:49,199 --> 04:03:50,804
TALIESIN: This is the Winnie the Pooh of krakens.

4827
04:03:50,804 --> 04:03:52,960
It's just trying its mild calisthenics to just try 
and make things.

4828
04:03:52,960 --> 04:03:54,743
MATT: All right, so it makes a lightning storm--

4829
04:03:54,743 --> 04:03:55,889
LIAM: I thought he was being nice to us.

4830
04:03:55,889 --> 04:03:56,909
MATT: -- that strikes you guys--

4831
04:03:56,909 --> 04:03:58,897
LIAM: He was just being nice to us!

4832
04:03:59,200 --> 04:03:59,863
TALIESIN: And it tickles.

4833
04:03:59,863 --> 04:04:00,585
LIAM: He's tired!

4834
04:04:00,585 --> 04:04:02,354
MATT: -- and, yeah, it tickles your fancy a moment
as two of its legendary actions.

4835
04:04:02,354 --> 04:04:03,735
LAURA: Aw.

4836
04:04:03,981 --> 04:04:05,267
MATT: All right, Percy, it's your turn.

4837
04:04:05,267 --> 04:04:07,683
TALIESIN: I am going to book, double speed--

4838
04:04:07,683 --> 04:04:10,133
MATT: Respect. Respect on the electric eels that I
gave you.

4839
04:04:10,133 --> 04:04:11,814
ALL: Yay!

4840
04:04:11,814 --> 04:04:13,338
MATT: Weirdly, saving your ass right now.

4841
04:04:13,338 --> 04:04:15,085
MARISHA: Dumb idea that worked out.

4842
04:04:15,085 --> 04:04:17,314
TALIESIN: I'm going to book through this weird
little log.

4843
04:04:17,314 --> 04:04:19,573
LIAM: 5.9, 6.2, 6.3--

4844
04:04:19,573 --> 04:04:21,373
TALIESIN: I'm going to go straight through it.

4845
04:04:21,373 --> 04:04:22,312
LAURA: Ooh, yeah!

4846
04:04:22,312 --> 04:04:26,424
MATT: 20, 25, 30. You just get out the other side,
just barely seeing the eel-Vex ahead of you, just

4847
04:04:26,424 --> 04:04:27,981
swimming through.

4848
04:04:27,981 --> 04:04:29,681
LAURA: I wink at him, with my eel eye.

4849
04:04:29,681 --> 04:04:30,921
SAM: Ugh.

4850
04:04:30,921 --> 04:04:32,544
TALIESIN: Ahh.

4851
04:04:32,544 --> 04:04:35,278
SAM: You know what, this is like an electricity
between you guys.

4852
04:04:35,278 --> 04:04:36,412
MATT: Oh.

4853
04:04:36,412 --> 04:04:38,982
TALIESIN: Wait, wait, right in the eye. Right in
the eye.

4854
04:04:38,982 --> 04:04:40,841
MATT: End of Vex's turn, it's gonna use its last
legendary action--

4855
04:04:40,841 --> 04:04:41,802
LIAM: Hey. Fish porn.

4856
04:04:41,802 --> 04:04:44,591
MATT: -- to attempt to make a--

4857
04:04:44,591 --> 04:04:46,079
SAM: He throws water at us.

4858
04:04:46,079 --> 04:04:48,493
MATT: -- a tentacle attack at--

4859
04:04:48,493 --> 04:04:49,524
TRAVIS: He throws water at us.

4860
04:04:49,524 --> 04:04:51,852
MATT: -- at you, Vax. The one that just recently
severed one of its tentacles.

4861
04:04:51,852 --> 04:04:53,033
LIAM: Okay.

4862
04:04:53,033 --> 04:04:54,324
MARISHA: It's one of those mega water balloons.

4863
04:04:54,324 --> 04:04:57,147
MATT: That is a 28 to hit. Ten plus 18.

4864
04:04:57,147 --> 04:04:58,844
LIAM: A what to hit?

4865
04:04:58,844 --> 04:04:59,699
LAURA: Well, you're an eel.

4866
04:04:59,699 --> 04:05:00,785
MATT: 28.

4867
04:05:00,785 --> 04:05:04,023
LIAM: Oh okay, do I not have-- am I hasted? Do I
still have advantage

4868
04:05:04,023 --> 04:05:08,020
on my dex saving throws? As an eel?

4869
04:05:08,020 --> 04:05:09,280
MATT: The effect is still on there, so yeah.

4870
04:05:09,280 --> 04:05:10,234
TALIESIN: Very clever eel.

4871
04:05:10,234 --> 04:05:13,580
LIAM: So it's, 'cause I'm blessed as well-- oh,
it's a 32.

4872
04:05:13,580 --> 04:05:15,924
TALIESIN: Yeah!

4873
04:05:15,924 --> 04:05:17,749
MATT: For dex saving throw?

4874
04:05:17,749 --> 04:05:18,714
LAURA: But wait, no, it's-- is it an eel's--

4875
04:05:18,714 --> 04:05:19,708
MATT: No, it's an attack roll.

4876
04:05:19,708 --> 04:05:20,665
LIAM: Oh, it's an attack roll. Oh, okay.

4877
04:05:20,665 --> 04:05:22,539
MATT: Against your AC, which as an eel is like,
ten, so you take damage.

4878
04:05:22,539 --> 04:05:23,772
LIAM: Oh, okay.

4879
04:05:23,772 --> 04:05:24,977
MARISHA: You take its physical--

4880
04:05:24,977 --> 04:05:27,360
LAURA: -- attributes.

4881
04:05:27,360 --> 04:05:28,888
MARISHA: Yeah.

4882
04:05:28,888 --> 04:05:30,232
MATT: That is 18 points of bludgeoning damage.

4883
04:05:30,232 --> 04:05:31,448
LIAM: What did it roll? Sorry, I thought--

4884
04:05:31,448 --> 04:05:32,193
TRAVIS: 32.

4885
04:05:32,193 --> 04:05:32,837
MATT: 28.

4886
04:05:32,837 --> 04:05:33,839
LIAM: Oh it definitely hit. Yeah, I'm sorry.

4887
04:05:33,839 --> 04:05:34,595
MATT: 28.

4888
04:05:34,595 --> 04:05:35,704
LAURA: Plus, you're an eel. It's a 10 AC.

4889
04:05:35,704 --> 04:05:36,704
MATT: So your eel form is destroyed--

4890
04:05:36,704 --> 04:05:37,854
LIAM: Got it. Aw.

4891
04:05:37,854 --> 04:05:42,505
MATT: -- and you take eight points of bludgeoning
damage, and you are grappled.

4892
04:05:42,505 --> 04:05:44,159
LAURA: Fuck.

4893
04:05:44,159 --> 04:05:45,701
TALIESIN: He's got the dagger, though.

4894
04:05:45,701 --> 04:05:46,508
LAURA: Yeah.

4895
04:05:46,508 --> 04:05:48,187
MARISHA: Wait, why is his eel form destroyed?

4896
04:05:48,187 --> 04:05:49,052
LAURA: 'Cause it was 10 hit--

4897
04:05:49,052 --> 04:05:50,077
MATT: 'Cause it has almost no hit points.

4898
04:05:50,077 --> 04:05:51,261
LIAM: 'Cause it smacked the shit out of me.

4899
04:05:51,261 --> 04:05:53,576
MATT: The lightning did nothing, but it just
bludgeoned and grabbed

4900
04:05:53,576 --> 04:05:55,995
and squeezed around the eel, and then 
you formed back within its grasp.

4901
04:05:55,995 --> 04:05:57,367
TALIESIN: It's not a giant eel, it's just an eel.

4902
04:05:57,367 --> 04:05:58,688
LAURA: Yeah. He's got like no hit points as an
eel.

4903
04:05:58,688 --> 04:05:59,816
MARISHA: Yeah, all right.

4904
04:05:59,816 --> 04:06:00,970
TALIESIN: I can kill an eel. Anybody can.

4905
04:06:00,970 --> 04:06:01,830
MARISHA: All right.

4906
04:06:01,830 --> 04:06:02,924
LIAM: I'm sorry, Matt, what was the hit point
damage?

4907
04:06:02,924 --> 04:06:03,971
MATT: "All right", you arguing?

4908
04:06:03,971 --> 04:06:04,896
LIAM: There's so much shit--

4909
04:06:04,896 --> 04:06:05,776
LAURA: Eight. Eight.

4910
04:06:05,776 --> 04:06:06,833
MARISHA and TALIESIN: No. No, we're not arguing.

4911
04:06:06,833 --> 04:06:08,754
MARISHA: "All right" is not the statement of
someone who's arguing.

4912
04:06:08,754 --> 04:06:10,466
MATT: Just making sure. I know. It's all good.

4913
04:06:10,466 --> 04:06:11,491
MARISHA: "All right" is literally "all right."

4914
04:06:11,582 --> 04:06:13,428
SAM: Snakes have, like, two hit points.

4915
04:06:13,428 --> 04:06:15,845
TALIESIN: No that's a kitten, have two hit points.
Snakes have, like, six.

4916
04:06:15,845 --> 04:06:18,035
MATT: I just, I ruled you guys to have ten hit
points in that form.

4917
04:06:18,035 --> 04:06:22,587
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're ten-hit-point eels.

4918
04:06:22,734 --> 04:06:23,709
MARISHA: That's fine.

4919
04:06:23,709 --> 04:06:24,652
TALIESIN: That's fair.

4920
04:06:24,652 --> 04:06:26,585
MATT: Yeah, flying snake is, like, five hit
points, so. You're fine.

4921
04:06:26,585 --> 04:06:27,233
MARISHA: Sure.

4922
04:06:27,233 --> 04:06:28,784
TALIESIN: They have flying snake? Never mind, I
don't want to know.

4923
04:06:28,784 --> 04:06:33,875
MATT: So that ends-- all right, so that was on
Percy's turn.

4924
04:06:33,875 --> 04:06:36,138
End of that turn. It's back to the Kraken's turn.

4925
04:06:36,138 --> 04:06:37,439
TRAVIS: Great.

4926
04:06:37,439 --> 04:06:39,093
MATT: The kraken gets its legendary actions back.

4927
04:06:39,093 --> 04:06:40,245
LIAM and LAURA: Shit.

4928
04:06:40,245 --> 04:06:41,838
MARISHA: Did you skip me?

4929
04:06:41,838 --> 04:06:43,006
SAM: You did plenty.

4930
04:06:43,006 --> 04:06:43,894
LIAM: You turned us into eels.

4931
04:06:43,894 --> 04:06:44,957
MATT: Yeah.

4932
04:06:44,957 --> 04:06:47,360
MARISHA: I thought I was after Vax?

4933
04:06:47,360 --> 04:06:48,755
MATT: Vax went, then you turned everyone into
eels.

4934
04:06:48,755 --> 04:06:49,661
MARISHA: Okay.

4935
04:06:49,661 --> 04:06:50,800
MATT: And then it went to the 20 count.

4936
04:06:50,800 --> 04:06:51,910
LAURA: And then I went, then Percy went.

4937
04:06:51,910 --> 04:06:53,536
MATT: So now it's back to the kraken.

4938
04:06:53,536 --> 04:06:54,594
LIAM: I just got whacked.

4939
04:06:54,594 --> 04:06:55,673
MARISHA: I confused you with Percy.

4940
04:06:55,673 --> 04:06:56,835
MATT: You did, it's okay.

4941
04:06:56,835 --> 04:06:57,948
TALIESIN: It happens.

4942
04:06:57,948 --> 04:06:59,019
MATT: All right, the kraken's going to do three
bashes.

4943
04:06:59,019 --> 04:07:00,241
LIAM: It's all right. We're both sad.

4944
04:07:00,241 --> 04:07:01,755
MATT: It's going to be against Grog, it's going to
be against Keyleth,

4945
04:07:01,755 --> 04:07:03,450
it's going to be against Taryon.

4946
04:07:03,450 --> 04:07:04,199
SAM: Yeah.

4947
04:07:04,199 --> 04:07:06,083
LAURA: Fuck.

4948
04:07:06,083 --> 04:07:08,126
MATT: Grog, that is 29.

4949
04:07:08,126 --> 04:07:09,251
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4950
04:07:09,251 --> 04:07:11,459
MATT: Taryon, that is 31.

4951
04:07:11,459 --> 04:07:12,739
SAM: Nope.

4952
04:07:12,739 --> 04:07:20,558
MATT: (laughs) And, Keyleth, that is 34. All
right.

4953
04:07:20,558 --> 04:07:26,127
So against Grog, that is 24 points of 
bludgeoning damage.

4954
04:07:26,127 --> 04:07:27,790
TRAVIS: Halved to 12.

4955
04:07:27,790 --> 04:07:31,584
MATT: You are an eel and grappled. You are out of
your eel form and you're grappled. So-- well, your

4956
04:07:31,584 --> 04:07:35,466
eel form just goes dead then you take-- what did I
say again? It was 24--

4957
04:07:35,466 --> 04:07:36,466
TRAVIS: 24.

4958
04:07:36,466 --> 04:07:40,896
MATT: You take 14 points of bludgeoning damage--
still raging-- halved to seven.

4959
04:07:40,996 --> 04:07:41,588
TRAVIS: Okay.

4960
04:07:41,588 --> 04:07:44,546
MATT: Taryon, your eel form is destroyed.

4961
04:07:44,546 --> 04:07:45,717
SAM: Mm-hm.

4962
04:07:45,717 --> 04:07:50,350
MATT: That would be 22 points, so you take 12
points of bludgeoning damage.

4963
04:07:50,350 --> 04:07:51,208
SAM: Okay.

4964
04:07:51,208 --> 04:08:00,279
MATT: And you are grappled. Keyleth-- lucky roll.
That is 14 points of bludgeoning damage. Your eel

4965
04:08:00,410 --> 04:08:03,378
form is done. You're grappled, and you take 
four points of bludgeoning damage.

4966
04:08:03,478 --> 04:08:09,017
MARISHA: Okay.

4967
04:08:09,120 --> 04:08:11,616
MATT: Eel freed itself, so now you're back up on
your feet.

4968
04:08:11,616 --> 04:08:13,779
MARISHA: Who's still an eel?

4969
04:08:13,779 --> 04:08:14,612
SAM: No one.

4970
04:08:14,612 --> 04:08:15,575
LAURA: Me and Percy.

4971
04:08:15,575 --> 04:08:16,479
TALIESIN: Neal the eel.

4972
04:08:16,479 --> 04:08:17,688
MATT: Taryon as well.

4973
04:08:17,688 --> 04:08:20,417
TRAVIS: Can I make a retaliation since he smacked
me?

4974
04:08:20,417 --> 04:08:21,865
MATT: You can.

4975
04:08:21,865 --> 04:08:23,595
Against him or the tentacle?

4976
04:08:23,800 --> 04:08:24,850
TRAVIS: The tentacle.

4977
04:08:24,850 --> 04:08:26,422
MATT: All right.

4978
04:08:26,422 --> 04:08:27,239
TRAVIS: Reckless.

4979
04:08:27,239 --> 04:08:29,456
MATT: Reckless.

4980
04:08:29,456 --> 04:08:30,418
LAURA: Ooh, that's good.

4981
04:08:30,418 --> 04:08:31,633
TRAVIS: That's a 31.

4982
04:08:31,633 --> 04:08:35,192
MATT: That hits.

4983
04:08:35,192 --> 04:08:36,660
TRAVIS: Seven, 22.

4984
04:08:36,660 --> 04:08:42,193
MATT: 22 points of damage. You slam into the
tentacle and it's still holding, but it's looking

4985
04:08:42,193 --> 04:08:45,551
severely damaged. It's starting to-- the muscle's
starting to tear apart. All right.

4986
04:08:45,551 --> 04:08:49,541
MARISHA: Don't kill it.

4987
04:08:49,541 --> 04:08:53,922
MATT: That brings us to Grog, your turn. Grog,
your turn.

4988
04:08:53,922 --> 04:08:55,135
LAURA: It's okay, it's okay.

4989
04:08:55,135 --> 04:08:56,739
TALIESIN: We can bring it back.

4990
04:08:56,739 --> 04:09:01,664
TRAVIS: May I make my first strike a vengeance
upon that stupid tentacle?

4991
04:09:01,664 --> 04:09:02,813
MATT: Go for it.

4992
04:09:02,813 --> 04:09:07,842
TRAVIS: Yep. Reckless! That was not a roll. 30.

4993
04:09:07,842 --> 04:09:09,458
MATT: 30.

4994
04:09:09,458 --> 04:09:11,231
(all laugh)

4995
04:09:11,231 --> 04:09:12,509
SAM: I need some d8s.

4996
04:09:12,509 --> 04:09:14,164
TRAVIS: One, 16 points of damage.

4997
04:09:14,164 --> 04:09:17,885
MATT: 16 points of damage. You slam it again. This
time the tentacle tears open and you're free.

4998
04:09:17,885 --> 04:09:19,457
You are no longer grappled.

4999
04:09:19,457 --> 04:09:21,542
TRAVIS: Sweet. Who's in the tentacle next to me?

5000
04:09:21,542 --> 04:09:23,034
MATT: You're gathering at this point, like,
somewhere having

5001
04:09:23,034 --> 04:09:24,927
around 30 points of damage gets rid of the 
tentacle.

5002
04:09:24,927 --> 04:09:27,289
TALIESIN: Are we down three tentacles now?

5003
04:09:27,289 --> 04:09:29,101
LAURA: Yeah, how many tentacles are we--

5004
04:09:29,101 --> 04:09:31,112
MATT: You now are down four tentacles total. Six
left.

5005
04:09:31,112 --> 04:09:32,919
TALISIN: Oh. Six left.

5006
04:09:32,919 --> 04:09:34,713
TRAVIS: Who's in the tentacle next to me?

5007
04:09:34,713 --> 04:09:38,212
MATT: Just below you about ten feet is Keyleth and
Vax.

5008
04:09:38,212 --> 04:09:43,351
TRAVIS: I mosey over to the one that Keyleth is
in.

5009
04:09:43,351 --> 04:09:44,974
MATT: All righty.

5010
04:09:44,974 --> 04:09:46,593
TRAVIS: And I will smash that tentacle.

5011
04:09:46,593 --> 04:09:48,109
MATT: All right. Keyleth, I need you to make a
constitution saving throw,

5012
04:09:48,109 --> 04:09:49,948
by the way. With advantage.

5013
04:09:49,948 --> 04:09:51,573
MARISHA: Ooh.

5014
04:09:51,573 --> 04:09:53,162
TRAVIS: Should I go ahead and roll?

5015
04:09:53,162 --> 04:09:54,448
MATT: 'Cause you took damage-- with the shift
form.

5016
04:09:54,448 --> 04:09:55,401
LAURA: Oh, right.

5017
04:09:55,401 --> 04:09:55,973
MARISHA: Oh boy.

5018
04:09:55,973 --> 04:09:56,955
LAURA: Is Beast Shape concentration?

5019
04:09:56,955 --> 04:09:57,848
MARISHA: Oh that's good. 15.

5020
04:09:57,848 --> 04:09:58,528
MATT: You're fine.

5021
04:09:58,528 --> 04:09:59,572
TRAVIS: That's a natural 20.

5022
04:09:59,572 --> 04:10:00,578
LAURA: Oh! That's a natural 20!

5023
04:10:00,578 --> 04:10:03,905
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage for that plus
your-- ha. So, roll the d10.

5024
04:10:03,905 --> 04:10:05,504
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5025
04:10:05,504 --> 04:10:06,258
MATT: Times two.

5026
04:10:06,258 --> 04:10:07,485
TRAVIS: Which is a nine.

5027
04:10:07,485 --> 04:10:08,530
TRAVIS and MATT: 18.

5028
04:10:08,530 --> 04:10:10,189
TRAVIS: And I get a two additional damage die.

5029
04:10:10,189 --> 04:10:12,482
MATT: Yes, you do. So roll two more d10s.

5030
04:10:12,482 --> 04:10:19,509
TRAVIS: Okay. Actually, I do nine plus the rage
damage, and then I just roll this twice.

5031
04:10:19,509 --> 04:10:20,239
MATT: Yes.

5032
04:10:20,239 --> 04:10:21,441
TRAVIS: Right. Okay, so that's--

5033
04:10:21,441 --> 04:10:24,929
MATT: Well, nine plus rage damage-- well, 9 times
two, so it's 18 plus rage damage, plus your

5034
04:10:24,929 --> 04:10:27,016
strength modifier. You destroyed the tentacle. The
tentacle's dead.

5035
04:10:27,016 --> 04:10:27,853
TRAVIS: Cool.

5036
04:10:27,853 --> 04:10:28,923
(all laugh)

5037
04:10:28,923 --> 04:10:33,878
MATT: Yeah, Keyleth's tentacle is just smeared
like a-- you slam into it and watch as a cloud of

5038
04:10:33,878 --> 04:10:40,297
dark purple liquid kind of goes past her face. The
blood from the kraken clears and the tentacle just

5039
04:10:40,297 --> 04:10:43,742
goes limp, the section that's been removed from
the rest of the tendril.

5040
04:10:43,742 --> 04:10:47,632
TRAVIS: Not that you even need it, but I try and
release Vax as well.

5041
04:10:47,632 --> 04:10:48,681
MATT: Go for it. So roll for--

5042
04:10:48,681 --> 04:10:53,186
TRAVIS: Reckless! 16. 30-- 20-- 32.

5043
04:10:53,186 --> 04:10:54,310
MATT: Yeah, it hits.

5044
04:10:54,310 --> 04:10:57,434
TRAVIS: Cool. Seven. 22.

5045
04:10:57,434 --> 04:11:02,189
MATT: 22. You slam into the side of Vax's
tentacle, bash it, bash it. It's starting to tear

5046
04:11:02,189 --> 04:11:04,013
apart, but it's not enough to free him entirely.

5047
04:11:04,013 --> 04:11:08,716
TRAVIS: Cool. I am going to biggity-buck the fat
out!

5048
04:11:08,716 --> 04:11:10,406
(all laugh)

5049
04:11:10,406 --> 04:11:13,292
MATT: All right, your movement is 50, and you've
not used Alter Self, right?

5050
04:11:13,292 --> 04:11:14,578
TRAVIS: No, 'cause I don't have that!

5051
04:11:14,578 --> 04:11:15,535
MATT: Yes, that's--

5052
04:11:15,535 --> 04:11:17,176
LAURA: Yes you do. You have a coin!

5053
04:11:17,176 --> 04:11:18,050
TRAVIS: Oh, but that--

5054
04:11:18,050 --> 04:11:20,850
MATT: Yeah, but you have to use an action to do
so. So that's five, ten--

5055
04:11:20,850 --> 04:11:22,198
LAURA: But that's good to know.

5056
04:11:22,198 --> 04:11:26,872
MATT: -- 15, 20, 25. 'Cause your movement's 50
normally.

5057
04:11:26,872 --> 04:11:27,773
TRAVIS: Nice.

5058
04:11:27,773 --> 04:11:29,173
MATT: So that's as far as you can get just kind of
swimming by,

5059
04:11:29,173 --> 04:11:32,179
trying to get over there. Ends your turn, Grog.

5060
04:11:32,179 --> 04:11:32,973
TRAVIS: Thank you.

5061
04:11:32,973 --> 04:11:33,847
MATT: All right.

5062
04:11:33,847 --> 04:11:35,282
TRAVIS: Making real good distance.

5063
04:11:35,282 --> 04:11:39,577
MATT: End of your turn, it's going to use
Lightning Storm. Two actions. It's going to hit

5064
04:11:39,577 --> 04:11:45,384
Grog, Vax, and Keyleth. Need all three of you to
make

5065
04:11:45,384 --> 04:11:48,981
dexterity saving throws, with Vax at disadvantage.

5066
04:11:48,981 --> 04:11:50,574
MARISHA: Is this considered a spell?

5067
04:11:50,574 --> 04:11:51,414
MATT: Nope.

5068
04:11:51,414 --> 04:11:52,501
MARISHA: Okay.

5069
04:11:52,501 --> 04:11:54,565
TRAVIS: Are we all at disadvantage on the dex
throws?

5070
04:11:54,565 --> 04:11:55,656
MATT: No, just Vax.

5071
04:11:55,656 --> 04:11:58,009
TRAVIS: Okay, so I get two.

5072
04:11:58,009 --> 04:11:59,135
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil!

5073
04:11:59,135 --> 04:12:00,671
LIAM: 21.

5074
04:12:00,671 --> 04:12:02,226
MARISHA: What am I doing? Dex save?

5075
04:12:02,226 --> 04:12:03,825
MATT: That's not going to make it, unfortunately.

5076
04:12:03,825 --> 04:12:05,135
LIAM: So the fail means I take half damage.

5077
04:12:05,135 --> 04:12:06,055
MATT: Correct.

5078
04:12:06,055 --> 04:12:07,165
LIAM: Plus the Deathwalker's Ward, so quarter
damage.

5079
04:12:07,165 --> 04:12:08,160
MATT: Correct.

5080
04:12:08,160 --> 04:12:09,825
TRAVIS: 17 for me.

5081
04:12:09,825 --> 04:12:12,016
MARISHA: 22 for--

5082
04:12:12,016 --> 04:12:13,105
MATT: And Taryon as well, actually.

5083
04:12:13,105 --> 04:12:13,986
SAM: Oh! Great.

5084
04:12:13,986 --> 04:12:16,217
TRAVIS: Oh, wait! Blessed. Blessed! #Blessed,
bitch!

5085
04:12:16,217 --> 04:12:17,793
LAURA: Still?

5086
04:12:17,793 --> 04:12:18,651
TALIESIN: Add a d4.

5087
04:12:18,651 --> 04:12:19,532
MARISHA: (gasps)

5088
04:12:19,532 --> 04:12:21,072
LIAM: I haven't made a constitution save in a
while.

5089
04:12:21,072 --> 04:12:23,327
SAM: I mean, I'm grappled, right? So.

5090
04:12:23,327 --> 04:12:24,668
MATT: Well, it's not at disadvantage.

5091
04:12:24,668 --> 04:12:26,310
SAM: Oh. Okay.

5092
04:12:26,310 --> 04:12:27,090
MARISHA: Not great.

5093
04:12:27,090 --> 04:12:27,785
SAM: 12.

5094
04:12:27,785 --> 04:12:30,234
MATT: Wait, you're restrained, you are-- yes. So
yes. You do.

5095
04:12:30,234 --> 04:12:31,017
SAM: Natural one.

5096
04:12:31,017 --> 04:12:32,203
(all groan)

5097
04:12:32,203 --> 04:12:33,377
MATT: Yeah, so 24 points lightning damage.

5098
04:12:33,377 --> 04:12:34,603
SAM: Okay.

5099
04:12:34,603 --> 04:12:36,578
TALIESIN: You're awake.

5100
04:12:36,578 --> 04:12:38,175
MARISHA: 21 total for me?

5101
04:12:38,175 --> 04:12:39,762
MATT: 24 points of lightning damage.

5102
04:12:39,762 --> 04:12:40,933
MARISHA: I'm unconscious.

5103
04:12:40,933 --> 04:12:45,174
MATT: Keyleth falls unconscious once more. Vax.

5104
04:12:45,174 --> 04:12:48,902
LIAM: My turn? I'm just going to repeat what I did
before. Attack--

5105
04:12:48,902 --> 04:12:51,732
MATT: No, no. What-- you take 24 reduced to
half--

5106
04:12:51,732 --> 04:12:52,939
LIAM: To a quarter.

5107
04:12:52,939 --> 04:12:55,468
MATT: Yeah. So 12 points of lightning damage.
Reduced to quarter--

5108
04:12:55,468 --> 04:12:56,229
LAURA: Yeah.

5109
04:12:56,229 --> 04:12:56,951
MATT: -- six.

5110
04:12:56,951 --> 04:12:57,968
LIAM: Six.

5111
04:12:57,968 --> 04:12:58,961
MATT: Then Grog--

5112
04:12:58,961 --> 04:12:59,699
TRAVIS: 19.

5113
04:12:59,699 --> 04:13:01,516
MATT: 24 points lightning damage reduced to half.

5114
04:13:01,516 --> 04:13:02,819
TRAVIS and MATT: 12.

5115
04:13:02,819 --> 04:13:08,476
MATT: All right, so! That was the end of Grog's
turn. Taryon, your turn.

5116
04:13:08,476 --> 04:13:12,762
SAM: I reach into my magic satchel, this time
pulling out

5117
04:13:12,762 --> 04:13:18,839
a powerful healing potion, which I drink 
by myself.

5118
04:13:18,839 --> 04:13:19,750
MATT: Okay.

5119
04:13:19,750 --> 04:13:21,209
(all laugh)

5120
04:13:21,209 --> 04:13:27,966
SAM: Okay. 14, 21--

5121
04:13:27,966 --> 04:13:29,674
MARISHA: Is that what you needed all the d8s for?

5122
04:13:29,674 --> 04:13:30,970
SAM: Uh-huh. (laughs)

5123
04:13:30,970 --> 04:13:32,275
TALIESIN: Could have had a d8.

5124
04:13:32,275 --> 04:13:33,383
SAM: 35.

5125
04:13:33,383 --> 04:13:34,373
MATT: All right. Heal yourself 35.

5126
04:13:34,373 --> 04:13:34,847
LAURA: Wow.

5127
04:13:34,847 --> 04:13:35,990
SAM: Yeah.

5128
04:13:35,990 --> 04:13:36,984
LAURA: That's a major healing spell.

5129
04:13:36,984 --> 04:13:37,735
SAM: Yeah.

5130
04:13:37,735 --> 04:13:38,489
MARISHA: Give me my d8s back.

5131
04:13:38,489 --> 04:13:39,774
(all laugh)

5132
04:13:39,774 --> 04:13:40,635
MARISHA: Fuck you.

5133
04:13:40,635 --> 04:13:42,330
MATT: You still have your bonus action, if you
want to do anything.

5134
04:13:42,330 --> 04:13:45,016
SAM: Just sort of gently weep.

5135
04:13:45,016 --> 04:13:47,899
TRAVIS: Weep! (laughs)

5136
04:13:47,899 --> 04:13:53,966
SAM: Yeah, just kind of weep softly.

5137
04:13:53,966 --> 04:13:56,436
MATT: Vax, you're up.

5138
04:13:56,436 --> 04:13:59,196
SAM: I'll do one more Sanctuary on myself! That's
my last spell.

5139
04:13:59,196 --> 04:14:01,026
MATT: Sanctuary, technically, is still lasting,
'cause it's not concentration.

5140
04:14:01,026 --> 04:14:03,304
SAM: It's not! Oh, well then--

5141
04:14:03,304 --> 04:14:06,242
MATT: Well, no, every time you attack you lose it.
You're right. I keep forgetting that, so yes.

5142
04:14:06,242 --> 04:14:07,826
SAM: But I haven't attacked him in a while.

5143
04:14:07,826 --> 04:14:09,770
LAURA: You've attacked him with acid since.

5144
04:14:09,770 --> 04:14:10,559
MATT: You cut a tentacle.

5145
04:14:10,559 --> 04:14:11,527
SAM: I did. I did.

5146
04:14:11,527 --> 04:14:12,560
MATT: So Sanctuary is back up. Okay.

5147
04:14:12,560 --> 04:14:14,199
LIAM: Is it on me now?

5148
04:14:14,199 --> 04:14:15,075
MATT: Yes.

5149
04:14:15,075 --> 04:14:17,832
LIAM: All right. Keyleth is adjacent to me, right?
On the ground?

5150
04:14:17,832 --> 04:14:19,144
MATT: Yes, she is.

5151
04:14:19,144 --> 04:14:22,051
LIAM: Okay. So I'm going to use my first action to
cast Lay On Hands

5152
04:14:22,051 --> 04:14:23,919
and dump five hit points into her to 
wake her back up.

5153
04:14:23,919 --> 04:14:25,145
MATT: Okay.

5154
04:14:25,145 --> 04:14:30,184
LIAM: Next action is going to be to throw Whisper
into the ground again. And bamf to it.

5155
04:14:30,184 --> 04:14:34,698
MATT: All right. You just escape the grasp.

5156
04:14:34,698 --> 04:14:41,884
LIAM: And I'm going to use bonus action to back up
fucking 30 feet

5157
04:14:41,884 --> 04:14:44,758
towards the big-- yeah, towards the portal.

5158
04:14:44,758 --> 04:14:47,195
MATT: All right. By the way, all your guys' forms?
You revert

5159
04:14:47,195 --> 04:14:49,851
back to your normal selves. You are no 
longer eels.

5160
04:14:49,851 --> 04:14:52,417
MARISHA: Yeah I kind of went unconscience.

5161
04:14:52,417 --> 04:14:53,403
MATT: So you're backing up 30 feet?

5162
04:14:53,403 --> 04:14:54,450
LIAM: Yeah, backing up.

5163
04:14:54,450 --> 04:14:55,704
TRAVIS: Unconscience?

5164
04:14:55,704 --> 04:14:56,814
MARISHA: Unconscious.

5165
04:14:56,814 --> 04:14:57,764
TRAVIS: Take it easy there, champ.

5166
04:14:57,764 --> 04:14:58,523
MARISHA: Yeah, you know.

5167
04:14:58,523 --> 04:14:59,524
TRAVIS: Take it real slow.

5168
04:14:59,524 --> 04:15:03,214
MATT: You are hasted, so yeah, 30 feet. You just
get out of the range. It's going to take an attack

5169
04:15:03,214 --> 04:15:08,268
of opportunity on you with its tentacle. That is--
nine plus 18 is 27 to hit.

5170
04:15:08,268 --> 04:15:09,156
LIAM: Oh, that hits. Yeah.

5171
04:15:09,156 --> 04:15:10,075
MARISHA: It's Gil's fault.

5172
04:15:10,075 --> 04:15:10,797
TRAVIS: Yep.

5173
04:15:10,797 --> 04:15:11,795
MATT: You take--

5174
04:15:11,795 --> 04:15:13,634
LIAM: Uncanny Dodge.

5175
04:15:13,634 --> 04:15:15,019
MATT: -- 21 points of bludgeoning damage.

5176
04:15:15,019 --> 04:15:16,431
LIAM: Okay. Halved to ten or 11?

5177
04:15:16,431 --> 04:15:18,046
MATT: Halved to ten and you are grappled by the
tentacle.

5178
04:15:18,046 --> 04:15:19,820
LAURA: Ah, jeez!

5179
04:15:19,820 --> 04:15:20,943
LIAM: Mother bitch!

5180
04:15:20,943 --> 04:15:22,047
TRAVIS: Love America.

5181
04:15:22,047 --> 04:15:24,550
SAM: We just gotta get out of here.

5182
04:15:24,550 --> 04:15:26,166
(all laugh)

5183
04:15:26,166 --> 04:15:27,808
TRAVIS: I'm gonna kill this stupid sea puppy.

5184
04:15:27,808 --> 04:15:28,786
LAURA: Don't kill it. Don't kill it.

5185
04:15:28,786 --> 04:15:30,121
SAM: Don't kill it, get us out of there!

5186
04:15:30,121 --> 04:15:32,037
MARISHA: No! No, no, no. Get us out. Get us out.

5187
04:15:32,037 --> 04:15:32,800
MATT: All right.

5188
04:15:32,800 --> 04:15:33,646
TALIESIN: Leave it armless.

5189
04:15:33,646 --> 04:15:34,591
MARISHA: Leave it alone.

5190
04:15:34,591 --> 04:15:37,214
MATT: Keyleth, it's your turn. You come to
consciousness. Once more you watch as Vax is

5191
04:15:37,214 --> 04:15:40,749
darting off and a tentacle wraps around him. You
see Taryon pulled,

5192
04:15:40,749 --> 04:15:42,482
but the rest of your allies are rushing off 
in the distance.

5193
04:15:42,482 --> 04:15:44,273
MARISHA: We have all the lodestones, right?

5194
04:15:44,273 --> 04:15:46,741
LAURA: Yes, we do. All the lodestones.

5195
04:15:46,741 --> 04:15:48,057
TALIESIN: Are you getting hit in the head?

5196
04:15:48,057 --> 04:15:51,432
MARISHA: Yes! I literally have! Fuck!

5197
04:15:51,432 --> 04:15:52,408
MATT: What are you doing?

5198
04:15:52,408 --> 04:15:54,701
MARISHA: Who is closest by the portal?

5199
04:15:54,701 --> 04:15:57,236
MATT: You can't see from where you are. It's
actually blocked.

5200
04:15:57,236 --> 04:16:00,596
You just see this giant, jutting underwater 
structure.

5201
04:16:00,596 --> 04:16:01,807
TRAVIS: An ink cloud.

5202
04:16:01,807 --> 04:16:04,034
LAURA: No, not anymore.

5203
04:16:04,034 --> 04:16:06,173
MARISHA: There's an ink cloud?

5204
04:16:06,173 --> 04:16:07,432
LAURA: No, not anymore. They got--

5205
04:16:07,432 --> 04:16:09,225
MARISHA: I got rid of that, right?

5206
04:16:09,225 --> 04:16:12,999
MATT: No, you only got rid of part of it here. The
ink cloud still sits in this vicinity.

5207
04:16:12,999 --> 04:16:15,432
LAURA: Oh.

5208
04:16:15,432 --> 04:16:19,920
MARISHA: Okay. Oh, dear god. I'm gonna Control
Water again.

5209
04:16:19,920 --> 04:16:21,800
MATT: You're casting it again?

5210
04:16:21,800 --> 04:16:22,961
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm casting it again.

5211
04:16:22,961 --> 04:16:23,842
MATT: Okay.

5212
04:16:23,842 --> 04:16:25,057
SAM: Get outta there.

5213
04:16:25,057 --> 04:16:26,218
MARISHA: Who's around me?

5214
04:16:26,218 --> 04:16:30,109
MATT: Around you it is Grog, it is Vax, and it is
Taryon.

5215
04:16:30,109 --> 04:16:31,406
MARISHA: I am going to--

5216
04:16:31,406 --> 04:16:32,750
MATT: And a shark.

5217
04:16:32,750 --> 04:16:37,098
MARISHA: -- push us towards the portal with
Control Water. Just (sound of rushing water).

5218
04:16:37,098 --> 04:16:38,015
MATT: All of you, towards the portal?

5219
04:16:38,015 --> 04:16:40,211
MARISHA: Yeah. Control Water towards the portal.

5220
04:16:40,211 --> 04:16:48,422
MATT: All right. Say, 20 feet. Five, ten, 15, 20.
Five, ten, 15, 20. Five, ten, 15, 20.

5221
04:16:48,422 --> 04:16:51,060
MARISHA: Is there anyone still held on by the
kraken?

5222
04:16:51,060 --> 04:16:51,861
LAURA: No.

5223
04:16:51,861 --> 04:16:52,666
MATT: Yeah.

5224
04:16:52,666 --> 04:16:53,469
LAURA: Oh.

5225
04:16:53,469 --> 04:16:58,746
MATT: I mean, Taryon and Vax are still grappled by
it, and this-- the kraken gets moved to there.

5226
04:16:58,746 --> 04:17:00,110
LIAM: It's got some long-ass tentacles.

5227
04:17:00,110 --> 04:17:01,007
MARISHA: Vax is still grappled?

5228
04:17:01,007 --> 04:17:01,887
MATT: 30-foot range.

5229
04:17:01,887 --> 04:17:02,745
LAURA: Yeah, and Tary.

5230
04:17:02,745 --> 04:17:04,157
LIAM: Yeah. I was just at the edge of its range
and it snagged me.

5231
04:17:04,157 --> 04:17:05,256
MATT: So you're right there.

5232
04:17:05,256 --> 04:17:10,789
MARISHA: Okay. I'm gonna take a Grasping Vine, I'm
gonna grab Vax and yank him towards me from this--

5233
04:17:10,789 --> 04:17:17,385
who's got the thing? From that-- that one closest
by.

5234
04:17:17,385 --> 04:17:19,516
MATT: And yank him towards you?

5235
04:17:19,516 --> 04:17:20,958
LIAM: Back towards the kraken?

5236
04:17:20,958 --> 04:17:21,833
MARISHA: This one.

5237
04:17:21,833 --> 04:17:24,690
LAURA: Why are you trying to yank him towards you?
You are directly under the Kraken.

5238
04:17:24,690 --> 04:17:26,187
MATT: You cannot see this, unfortunately.

5239
04:17:26,187 --> 04:17:27,162
MARISHA: I can't see that?

5240
04:17:27,162 --> 04:17:28,457
MATT: No, this is all obscured with ink right
now.

5241
04:17:28,457 --> 04:17:29,586
MARISHA: Can I see this red thing?

5242
04:17:29,586 --> 04:17:30,682
MATT: This thing got pushed this way--

5243
04:17:30,682 --> 04:17:31,776
MARISHA: Can I see this?

5244
04:17:31,776 --> 04:17:33,472
MATT: Actually, with your Control Water that
pushed this way would have cleared some ink in

5245
04:17:33,472 --> 04:17:36,726
this area, but right now this whole structure is
blocking it. You cannot see this rock.

5246
04:17:36,726 --> 04:17:38,419
MARISHA: Can I see this red thing in front of me?

5247
04:17:38,419 --> 04:17:39,933
MATT: This here, you can. Vax is right next to
it.

5248
04:17:39,933 --> 04:17:48,110
MARISHA: Okay. I'm gonna drag him closer in. I
wanna drag-- send him this way.

5249
04:17:48,110 --> 04:17:50,287
[no audio]

5250
04:17:50,287 --> 04:17:51,649
LIAM: -- wooden structure?

5251
04:17:51,649 --> 04:17:52,548
MARISHA: Beyond it.

5252
04:17:52,548 --> 04:17:55,568
MATT: Well, the Grasping Vine only pulls things
towards where it emanates, and since he's right

5253
04:17:55,568 --> 04:17:57,221
next to this, it'll just pull him right against
it.

5254
04:17:57,221 --> 04:17:58,685
MARISHA: Okay, Tary-- where's Tary?

5255
04:17:58,685 --> 04:18:00,284
MATT: Tary's right here as well, it'll just pull
him into the rock.

5256
04:18:00,284 --> 04:18:06,075
MARISHA: Well, bullshit all the way around. Then I
just swim desperately,

5257
04:18:06,075 --> 04:18:08,142
doggy paddle towards the portal.

5258
04:18:08,142 --> 04:18:09,756
MATT: You still have your bonus action.

5259
04:18:09,756 --> 04:18:12,432
MARISHA: There's-- what's left?

5260
04:18:12,432 --> 04:18:16,346
MATT: Your Wild Shape? Miss five hit points?

5261
04:18:16,346 --> 04:18:19,444
LAURA: Oh, yeah, that could be smart. Since-- so
you don't go unconscious again.

5262
04:18:19,444 --> 04:18:20,532
LIAM: Whale it, dude.

5263
04:18:20,532 --> 04:18:23,404
MARISHA: All right. I'll killer whale towards the
portal.

5264
04:18:23,404 --> 04:18:25,867
MATT: Not to tell you what you're doing, but this
is your thing and you're at five hit points,

5265
04:18:25,867 --> 04:18:27,916
right underneath the kraken, the closest to it.

5266
04:18:27,916 --> 04:18:28,946
MARISHA: Where am I?

5267
04:18:28,946 --> 04:18:29,722
MATT: You're here.

5268
04:18:29,722 --> 04:18:31,207
LIAM and LAURA: You're right under the kraken!

5269
04:18:31,207 --> 04:18:32,766
MARISHA: All right. All right. All right.

5270
04:18:32,766 --> 04:18:33,555
(LAURA laughs)

5271
04:18:33,555 --> 04:18:35,144
TALIESIN: It's very hard to see from this-- I will
say--

5272
04:18:35,144 --> 04:18:36,897
MARISHA: It is very hard to see from what this
is--

5273
04:18:36,897 --> 04:18:38,060
TALIESIN: --this map is a nightmare.

5274
04:18:38,060 --> 04:18:39,786
TRAVIS: Can we get some ammonia that we can pour
on a cloth and just, like, take a big whiff of?

5275
04:18:39,786 --> 04:18:40,678
MARISHA: Sure.

5276
04:18:40,678 --> 04:18:41,735
LAURA: Just wake her up?

5277
04:18:41,735 --> 04:18:42,947
MATT: What are you-- what are you Shaping into?

5278
04:18:42,947 --> 04:18:43,839
LAURA: Adrenaline.

5279
04:18:43,839 --> 04:18:44,936
MARISHA: I'll go killer whale.

5280
04:18:44,936 --> 04:18:45,906
MATT: Killer whale!

5281
04:18:45,906 --> 04:18:46,719
MARISHA: Yeah.

5282
04:18:46,719 --> 04:18:47,702
MATT: All righty.

5283
04:18:47,702 --> 04:18:50,194
TRAVIS: I think there's some in the first aid kit
in the hallway.

5284
04:18:50,194 --> 04:18:51,394
I'm pretty sure I stole some last week.

5285
04:18:51,394 --> 04:18:52,406
TALIESIN: More kraken.

5286
04:18:52,406 --> 04:18:53,258
MARISHA: That was true.

5287
04:18:53,258 --> 04:18:55,083
TALIESIN: Oh my god, you actually have a mini for
that one.

5288
04:18:55,083 --> 04:18:57,101
MATT: I don't actually. I did not come--

5289
04:18:57,101 --> 04:18:58,501
LIAM: I remember that bag.

5290
04:18:58,501 --> 04:19:01,043
MATT: I'll say for the sake of this-- for the time
being this--

5291
04:19:01,043 --> 04:19:02,154
MARISHA: It's fine.

5292
04:19:02,154 --> 04:19:05,678
MATT: -- this naga will be your killer whale.
Sure. That'll work.

5293
04:19:05,678 --> 04:19:07,001
LIAM: So pretty.

5294
04:19:07,001 --> 04:19:08,668
MATT: All righty.

5295
04:19:08,668 --> 04:19:13,242
MARISHA: And all of my Control Water direction is
towards the portal.

5296
04:19:13,242 --> 04:19:14,006
MATT: Yes.

5297
04:19:14,006 --> 04:19:15,023
MARISHA: Okay.

5298
04:19:15,023 --> 04:19:17,518
MATT: You've cleared out some of the ink in this
area. That's your turn.

5299
04:19:17,518 --> 04:19:18,665
MARISHA: Sure.

5300
04:19:18,665 --> 04:19:26,937
MATT: All righty. Top of the round. The kraken is
going to go ahead and-- the water current seems to

5301
04:19:26,937 --> 04:19:33,271
shift in the opposite direction. I need each
creature within 60 feet of the kraken,

5302
04:19:33,271 --> 04:19:37,553
which is all of you, to make a strength 
saving throw.

5303
04:19:37,553 --> 04:19:38,411
TRAVIS: Yeah!

5304
04:19:38,411 --> 04:19:39,570
LIAM: Son of a bitch.

5305
04:19:39,570 --> 04:19:41,272
TALIESIN: Aw, god damn it.

5306
04:19:41,272 --> 04:19:42,374
MARISHA: Is that including me?

5307
04:19:42,374 --> 04:19:43,592
MATT: Yeah, all of you.

5308
04:19:43,592 --> 04:19:44,489
SAM: 11.

5309
04:19:44,489 --> 04:19:45,810
MATT: 11?

5310
04:19:45,810 --> 04:19:52,958
TALIESIN: 23.

5311
04:19:53,093 --> 04:19:54,394
MATT: 23, all right.

5312
04:19:54,394 --> 04:19:55,378
TALIESIN: Yeah!

5313
04:19:55,378 --> 04:19:57,689
MATT: So you only get pushed ten feet.

5314
04:19:57,689 --> 04:19:58,798
MARISHA: 21.

5315
04:19:58,798 --> 04:19:59,534
MATT: Okay.

5316
04:19:59,534 --> 04:20:00,395
LIAM: 18.

5317
04:20:00,395 --> 04:20:01,368
LAURA: 23.

5318
04:20:01,368 --> 04:20:02,364
LIAM: Ooh.

5319
04:20:02,364 --> 04:20:03,347
MATT: Pushed ten feet.

5320
04:20:03,347 --> 04:20:04,429
LAURA: But only ten for Trinket.

5321
04:20:04,429 --> 04:20:05,260
MATT: Okay.

5322
04:20:05,260 --> 04:20:06,315
TRAVIS: 22.

5323
04:20:06,315 --> 04:20:11,205
MATT: 22 is a failure. All right. So that is 60
feet away from the kraken for everyone who failed.

5324
04:20:11,205 --> 04:20:12,354
SAM: What does that mean?

5325
04:20:12,354 --> 04:20:13,164
MATT: So.

5326
04:20:13,164 --> 04:20:15,890
SAM: We're just pushed away?

5327
04:20:15,890 --> 04:20:17,223
MATT: You're right over here, pushed away.

5328
04:20:17,223 --> 04:20:18,665
TALIESIN: It's doing a big like (raspberry).

5329
04:20:18,665 --> 04:20:21,935
MATT: The water just rushes through and pushes all
of you away. Trinket is pushed--

5330
04:20:21,935 --> 04:20:22,804
MARISHA: Who failed?

5331
04:20:22,804 --> 04:20:24,395
MATT: -- 60 feet that direction.

5332
04:20:24,395 --> 04:20:25,347
SAM: About everyone.

5333
04:20:25,347 --> 04:20:26,276
LAURA: All right.

5334
04:20:26,276 --> 04:20:28,728
MATT: Roll for the shark, if you could. It's gonna
maintain its grapple on you guys,

5335
04:20:28,728 --> 04:20:30,429
you guys are just being yanked in that direction.

5336
04:20:30,429 --> 04:20:31,172
LAURA: Does he--

5337
04:20:31,172 --> 04:20:32,280
MARISHA: Wait, who failed?

5338
04:20:32,280 --> 04:20:33,150
SAM: Like, everyone.

5339
04:20:33,150 --> 04:20:33,907
TALIESIN: Everyone.

5340
04:20:33,907 --> 04:20:34,929
LIAM: Yeah.

5341
04:20:34,929 --> 04:20:37,836
LAURA: I mean, 18 is what I rolled, I don't know
what I add for it.

5342
04:20:37,836 --> 04:20:41,825
MATT: Yeah, so no, that's not gonna-- so the shark
gets pushed up into that, there.

5343
04:20:41,937 --> 04:20:45,760
SAM: Fucking kraken. Do I get slammed into that
thing?

5344
04:20:45,760 --> 04:20:49,502
MATT: Actually, you do, but it doesn't do any
damage, it just kind of pushes you and the

5345
04:20:49,502 --> 04:20:53,094
tentacle kind of holds you there. Keeping you
grappled. It's not gonna release the grapple.

5346
04:20:53,094 --> 04:20:58,399
TALIESIN: That acid's gotta be-- burn through that
at some point. Is that a continuing--

5347
04:20:58,399 --> 04:21:00,360
SAM: That's a different tentacle.

5348
04:21:00,360 --> 04:21:00,958
MATT: Yep.

5349
04:21:01,060 --> 04:21:01,721
TALIESIN: Damn it.

5350
04:21:01,721 --> 04:21:04,337
MATT: All right. So. That brings us to Vex's
turn.

5351
04:21:04,337 --> 04:21:06,685
TALIESIN: One less.

5352
04:21:06,685 --> 04:21:10,274
LAURA: I mean, do I see any of this happening as
I'm just fucking swimming away? I guess my--

5353
04:21:10,274 --> 04:21:12,141
MATT: All the ink has now washed away to the
space,

5354
04:21:12,141 --> 04:21:15,008
and everyone gets pushed away by the force of 
the water.

5355
04:21:15,008 --> 04:21:23,514
LAURA: Fuck. I'm gonna swim up so I can see down
over the rock.

5356
04:21:23,514 --> 04:21:25,815
SAM: (accented) Over the rock?

5357
04:21:25,815 --> 04:21:27,304
MATT: Okay, so there, and you can just--

5358
04:21:27,304 --> 04:21:28,606
LIAM: What's your character's name?

5359
04:21:28,606 --> 04:21:30,339
MATT: -- see over this way, you can see your
brother there--

5360
04:21:30,339 --> 04:21:31,135
LAURA: Okay.

5361
04:21:31,135 --> 04:21:32,864
MATT: -- you see the kraken, you see everyone
being pushed to this way, and everything being

5362
04:21:32,864 --> 04:21:34,243
shoved to that direction.

5363
04:21:34,243 --> 04:21:39,207
LAURA: I'm gonna try to shoot an arrow into the
tentacle holding my brother.

5364
04:21:39,207 --> 04:21:41,702
MATT: All right, go for it.

5365
04:21:41,702 --> 04:21:43,926
LIAM: Where'd the Key-whale go?

5366
04:21:43,926 --> 04:21:45,728
LAURA: Oh. Disadvantage, right?

5367
04:21:45,728 --> 04:21:46,921
MATT: Yep.

5368
04:21:46,921 --> 04:21:48,151
LAURA: Same thing. 25?

5369
04:21:48,151 --> 04:21:51,843
MATT: 25 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

5370
04:21:51,843 --> 04:21:58,985
LAURA: 15, 16, 17. 17 damage, with four lightning,
which I'm sure does nothing.

5371
04:21:58,985 --> 04:22:02,303
MATT: Nope. That's enough. Your arrow goes right
through,

5372
04:22:02,303 --> 04:22:04,581
and that's the last bit of damage it needs 
to actually sever that tentacle.

5373
04:22:04,581 --> 04:22:07,540
LIAM: Love you!

5374
04:22:07,540 --> 04:22:08,513
LAURA: Sweet.

5375
04:22:08,513 --> 04:22:10,341
MATT: Freeing him. All right.

5376
04:22:10,341 --> 04:22:15,682
LAURA: And then I'm gonna-- do I have any movement
to swim back down and hide? As my bonus?

5377
04:22:15,682 --> 04:22:19,646
MATT: You could certainly try. If you land back
down that way--

5378
04:22:19,646 --> 04:22:20,973
LAURA: Oh, miss it.

5379
04:22:20,973 --> 04:22:27,857
MATT: So go ahead and roll-- breaking line of
sight just barely, go ahead and make a hide check.

5380
04:22:27,857 --> 04:22:29,381
LAURA: 22.

5381
04:22:29,381 --> 04:22:30,891
MATT: 22. Okay.

5382
04:22:30,891 --> 04:22:32,574
LAURA: And then I'm gonna have my shark attack
him.

5383
04:22:32,574 --> 04:22:33,451
MATT: Okay.

5384
04:22:33,451 --> 04:22:34,537
TRAVIS: How many tentacles does it have?

5385
04:22:34,537 --> 04:22:36,711
MATT: The shark has a speed of what? 40?

5386
04:22:36,711 --> 04:22:37,380
LAURA: Yeah.

5387
04:22:37,380 --> 04:22:38,362
MARISHA: Yeah.

5388
04:22:38,362 --> 04:22:43,101
MATT: 30, 35, 40. Just barely gets up into the
space to hit it, so.

5389
04:22:43,101 --> 04:22:45,288
LAURA: Plus nine-- 17 plus nine is 26!

5390
04:22:45,288 --> 04:22:46,488
MATT: 26 hits!

5391
04:22:46,488 --> 04:22:48,486
TALIESIN: Good shark.

5392
04:22:48,486 --> 04:22:51,284
LAURA: Good shark. Good shark. Good shark. With a
bite attack--

5393
04:22:51,284 --> 04:22:52,813
LIAM: Frickin' lasers.

5394
04:22:52,813 --> 04:22:57,911
LAURA: Sweet. 14.

5395
04:22:57,911 --> 04:23:00,596
MATT: 14 points of damage. All righty.

5396
04:23:00,596 --> 04:23:03,301
LAURA: I'm just using Trinket's stats, 'cause
that's what I had in front of me.

5397
04:23:03,301 --> 04:23:04,579
MATT: Sure.

5398
04:23:04,579 --> 04:23:05,874
LAURA: Is that terrible?

5399
04:23:05,874 --> 04:23:07,217
MATT: Yeah. But it's fine.

5400
04:23:07,217 --> 04:23:08,294
LAURA: I'm sorry.

5401
04:23:08,294 --> 04:23:13,532
MATT: You haven't done enough damage, near enough,
to really threaten the kraken yet, so you're fine.

5402
04:23:13,532 --> 04:23:14,497
LAURA: Okay.

5403
04:23:14,497 --> 04:23:15,366
MATT: All right.

5404
04:23:15,366 --> 04:23:16,498
TRAVIS: What turn's that?

5405
04:23:16,498 --> 04:23:17,684
MATT: Ending Vex's turn!

5406
04:23:17,684 --> 04:23:18,578
MARISHA: No.

5407
04:23:18,578 --> 04:23:19,854
MATT: End of the turn, it's gonna use its last
legendary action.

5408
04:23:19,854 --> 04:23:22,707
It's going to go ahead and make a tentacle 
attack at you.

5409
04:23:22,707 --> 04:23:25,237
LAURA: Oh, and Trinket's gonna swim towards the
door.

5410
04:23:25,237 --> 04:23:35,878
MATT: That's as far as Trinket can get. All
righty. That is a 29 to hit.

5411
04:23:35,878 --> 04:23:41,838
LIAM: Shit balls. 28. Wait--

5412
04:23:41,838 --> 04:23:42,553
TALIESIN: d4.

5413
04:23:42,553 --> 04:23:43,547
LIAM: I'm Blessed!

5414
04:23:43,547 --> 04:23:44,255
LAURA: It's your AC.

5415
04:23:44,255 --> 04:23:45,069
MATT: It's your AC.

5416
04:23:45,069 --> 04:23:45,841
LAURA: It's just your AC.

5417
04:23:45,841 --> 04:23:48,065
LIAM: Oh, fuck a duck, I thought I was doing it
in-- a Dex save. Then it got me.

5418
04:23:48,065 --> 04:23:49,332
MATT: That is 18 points of bludgeoning damage.

5419
04:23:49,332 --> 04:23:50,581
LIAM: Sure.

5420
04:23:50,581 --> 04:23:51,756
MATT: And you are grappled.

5421
04:23:51,756 --> 04:23:52,606
LIAM: Uncanny Dodge.

5422
04:23:52,606 --> 04:23:53,556
MATT: Right. So nine.

5423
04:23:53,556 --> 04:23:54,332
LIAM: Okay.

5424
04:23:54,332 --> 04:23:55,473
MATT: And it grapples you once more with that
tentacle.

5425
04:23:55,473 --> 04:23:56,285
LIAM: Okay.

5426
04:23:56,285 --> 04:23:57,487
TRAVIS: How many tentacles were left, like three?

5427
04:23:57,487 --> 04:23:58,142
MATT: Five.

5428
04:23:58,142 --> 04:23:59,044
TRAVIS: Five.

5429
04:23:59,044 --> 04:24:01,831
LAURA: Fuck, he has a lot of tentacles.

5430
04:24:01,831 --> 04:24:03,149
TALIESIN: They go down-- they go down fast,
though.

5431
04:24:03,149 --> 04:24:04,766
LIAM: Get out, get, go.

5432
04:24:04,766 --> 04:24:06,566
MATT: All righty. Percival. Your turn.

5433
04:24:06,566 --> 04:24:11,370
TALIESIN: I am booking double speed to that door,
'cause I am useless--

5434
04:24:11,370 --> 04:24:12,741
MARISHA: Get out, get out, get out, get out.

5435
04:24:12,741 --> 04:24:14,012
MATT: That's as far as you can go.

5436
04:24:14,012 --> 04:24:16,164
TALIESIN: And I'm also-- I've got form this-- so
I'm full speed.

5437
04:24:16,164 --> 04:24:17,042
MATT: What form?

5438
04:24:17,042 --> 04:24:18,034
MARISHA: Alter Self. Alter Self.

5439
04:24:18,034 --> 04:24:19,117
TALIESIN: Fins and gills. Alter Self.

5440
04:24:19,117 --> 04:24:20,117
MATT: That's right, you did, yeah. So, yeah.

5441
04:24:20,117 --> 04:24:21,077
MARISHA: Alter Self. Go, go, go out--

5442
04:24:21,077 --> 04:24:22,052
LAURA: And you're out!

5443
04:24:22,052 --> 04:24:22,760
MARISHA: Out! You're out!

5444
04:24:22,760 --> 04:24:23,558
MATT: You leap out, you are through.

5445
04:24:23,558 --> 04:24:24,567
LAURA: One's out! One's out!

5446
04:24:24,567 --> 04:24:25,390
LIAM: Yes, one of us will live!

5447
04:24:25,390 --> 04:24:27,817
TALIESIN: I am holding-- I am just, like, waiting
on the other end for everybody.

5448
04:24:27,817 --> 04:24:28,572
MATT: Okay.

5449
04:24:28,572 --> 04:24:29,576
MARISHA: But you made it! That's good!

5450
04:24:29,576 --> 04:24:30,494
LIAM: Who lives, who dies--

5451
04:24:30,494 --> 04:24:32,490
LIAM, MARISHA AND TALIESIN: --who tells our
story.

5452
04:24:32,490 --> 04:24:34,775
TALIESIN: Please, please no. Please, no.

5453
04:24:34,775 --> 04:24:35,778
LIAM: It's too late!

5454
04:24:35,778 --> 04:24:37,095
LAURA: It already happened.

5455
04:24:37,095 --> 04:24:38,067
LIAM: It's done.

5456
04:24:38,067 --> 04:24:38,933
MATT: Top of the kraken's turn--

5457
04:24:38,933 --> 04:24:39,748
LIAM: Jeez.

5458
04:24:39,748 --> 04:24:42,874
MARISHA: Just tell 'em, tell 'em Percy! Tell
Doty!

5459
04:24:42,874 --> 04:24:43,861
MATT: It's gonna move over here--

5460
04:24:43,861 --> 04:24:45,578
TALIESIN: I'm just so useless in this fight.

5461
04:24:45,578 --> 04:24:46,736
MATT: Grappled, Vax?

5462
04:24:46,736 --> 04:24:47,483
MARISHA: That's not true.

5463
04:24:47,483 --> 04:24:48,370
LIAM: Yeah.

5464
04:24:48,370 --> 04:24:49,268
MATT: It's going-- giant beak--

5465
04:24:49,268 --> 04:24:50,248
LAURA: No, no, no!

5466
04:24:50,248 --> 04:24:54,811
MATT: -- opens up towards you. That is a two plus
18, that is a 20 to hit.

5467
04:24:54,811 --> 04:24:55,588
LIAM: No.

5468
04:24:55,588 --> 04:24:58,079
MATT: Because of the Haste bonus.

5469
04:24:58,079 --> 04:24:58,779
LIAM: Yes.

5470
04:24:58,779 --> 04:25:01,589
TRAVIS: Oh, he does not swallow you.

5471
04:25:01,589 --> 04:25:03,377
LAURA: He doesn't swallow you!

5472
04:25:03,377 --> 04:25:09,342
MATT: I fuckin' rolled a two. Okay, all right, as
it goes and snaps towards you--

5473
04:25:09,342 --> 04:25:11,328
LIAM: Van Damme splits, just out of the way!

5474
04:25:11,328 --> 04:25:14,381
LAURA: But grappled.

5475
04:25:14,381 --> 04:25:22,485
MATT: However, hang on. However, while you were
attacked, you were restrained, so--

5476
04:25:22,485 --> 04:25:23,499
LAURA: I'm gonna throw up.

5477
04:25:23,499 --> 04:25:26,471
MATT: -- restrained creatures, attacks against
them do have advantage.

5478
04:25:26,471 --> 04:25:27,648
LIAM: Okay.

5479
04:25:27,648 --> 04:25:28,952
MATT: So, that is a 28.

5480
04:25:28,952 --> 04:25:30,526
LIAM: See ya later, guys.

5481
04:25:30,526 --> 04:25:32,133
SAM: You got swallowed?

5482
04:25:32,133 --> 04:25:33,174
LIAM: Mm-hm.

5483
04:25:33,174 --> 04:25:33,990
LAURA: What if you--

5484
04:25:33,990 --> 04:25:34,795
MARISHA: What?

5485
04:25:34,795 --> 04:25:36,595
MATT: I just realised that, 'cause it says-- I
forgot, it says here-- it says until the target's

5486
04:25:36,595 --> 04:25:41,027
grapple ends the target is restrained, and attacks
against restrained creatures have advantage.

5487
04:25:41,027 --> 04:25:43,300
LIAM: Is that at all connected to dexterity?

5488
04:25:43,300 --> 04:25:44,990
MATT: No.

5489
04:25:44,990 --> 04:25:45,879
LIAM: No. Okay.

5490
04:25:45,879 --> 04:25:46,905
MATT: Sorry.

5491
04:25:46,905 --> 04:25:47,885
LIAM: It's all right.

5492
04:25:47,885 --> 04:25:49,347
MATT: So that is--

5493
04:25:49,347 --> 04:25:52,134
SAM: Are you dead inside of it?

5494
04:25:52,134 --> 04:25:53,251
LAURA: Is this the ultimate fight of like--

5495
04:25:53,251 --> 04:25:54,397
SAM: Or just inside of it?

5496
04:25:54,397 --> 04:25:55,688
LAURA: Yes! Ugh.

5497
04:25:55,688 --> 04:25:56,823
MARISHA: No, he's just inside.

5498
04:25:56,823 --> 04:26:00,004
MATT: 15, 24, 34 points of piercing damage.

5499
04:26:00,004 --> 04:26:01,430
LIAM: I'm out.

5500
04:26:01,430 --> 04:26:06,957
LAURA: (gasps) you're unconscious inside of him?

5501
04:26:06,957 --> 04:26:09,521
MATT: And you are swallowed.

5502
04:26:09,521 --> 04:26:11,695
TRAVIS: Holy fucking shit.

5503
04:26:11,695 --> 04:26:13,168
SAM: He'll be fine. He'll be fine!

5504
04:26:13,168 --> 04:26:20,517
TRAVIS: This is insane. Oh my god.

5505
04:26:20,517 --> 04:26:22,229
MATT: All right.

5506
04:26:22,229 --> 04:26:24,087
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

5507
04:26:24,087 --> 04:26:28,432
MATT: That is the kraken's turn, Grog, you're up.
You watch as it just swallows Vax as his eyes go

5508
04:26:28,432 --> 04:26:34,496
limp, and the jaws just take his not moving form
and swallow inside.

5509
04:26:34,496 --> 04:26:36,353
TRAVIS: Um.

5510
04:26:36,353 --> 04:26:38,294
MARISHA: Does Keyleth see this?

5511
04:26:38,294 --> 04:26:42,291
MATT: You do, 'cause you're back here. Make an
intelligence check.

5512
04:26:42,291 --> 04:26:43,492
TRAVIS: An intelligence check?

5513
04:26:43,492 --> 04:26:44,861
MATT: I know.

5514
04:26:44,861 --> 04:26:48,546
TRAVIS: Hold on, everybody. Prepare for an
amazing--

5515
04:26:48,546 --> 04:26:50,652
LAURA: Natural 20.

5516
04:26:50,652 --> 04:26:52,313
TRAVIS: Nine.

5517
04:26:52,313 --> 04:26:56,842
MATT: All right. What are you doing?

5518
04:26:56,842 --> 04:27:02,324
TRAVIS: I am gonna attack this big stupid
sea-chicken.

5519
04:27:02,324 --> 04:27:08,569
MATT: Okay, so you just get into melee range.

5520
04:27:08,569 --> 04:27:10,458
TRAVIS: Wait, I mean-- yeah. Yeah.

5521
04:27:10,458 --> 04:27:11,921
SAM: Yeah, 'course.

5522
04:27:11,921 --> 04:27:14,533
MARISHA: Go for it, that's exactly what Grog would
do.

5523
04:27:14,533 --> 04:27:24,894
TRAVIS: Yeah, can I aim for one of its tentacles
that is functioning?

5524
04:27:24,894 --> 04:27:27,556
MATT: Sure. Go for it.

5525
04:27:27,556 --> 04:27:33,856
TRAVIS: Cool. Reckless. Natural 20.

5526
04:27:33,856 --> 04:27:34,979
MATT: Okay.

5527
04:27:34,979 --> 04:27:36,789
TRAVIS: Should've made it-- That's a--

5528
04:27:36,789 --> 04:27:38,015
LAURA: Wow.

5529
04:27:38,015 --> 04:27:47,686
TRAVIS: Ten, plus, 25, 30, 35.

5530
04:27:47,701 --> 04:27:51,535
MATT: 35 points of damage. You go ahead and sever
one of the nearby immediate tentacles as it's

5531
04:27:51,676 --> 04:27:53,516
whipping around you.

5532
04:27:53,516 --> 04:27:55,331
TRAVIS: I'll take the next tentacle that works.

5533
04:27:55,331 --> 04:27:59,835
MATT: Okay. As you finish that strike, you feel
this strange sense

5534
04:27:59,835 --> 04:28:03,046
piercing into your relatively unprotected skull.

5535
04:28:03,046 --> 04:28:04,509
TRAVIS: It's very unprotected.

5536
04:28:04,509 --> 04:28:09,812
MATT: As no language peeks through, but you get
this very strong, angry, hungry sense-- this

5537
04:28:09,812 --> 04:28:18,334
emotional force that says, "Oh, now you've made me
angry."

5538
04:28:18,334 --> 04:28:21,706
SAM: Ooh.

5539
04:28:21,706 --> 04:28:24,321
MATT: You start realising very quickly that this
creature, while it seemed like a force of nature,

5540
04:28:24,321 --> 04:28:30,009
has been just feeding, but you've got its
attention now.

5541
04:28:30,009 --> 04:28:32,895
SAM: Ooh.

5542
04:28:32,895 --> 04:28:39,617
MATT: Its instinct has turned now to its intellect
to reach out to its food. You've made it angry.

5543
04:28:39,617 --> 04:28:42,896
What are you doing with your next attack?

5544
04:28:42,896 --> 04:28:49,106
LAURA: Fuck. We shouldn't have attacked it so
much.

5545
04:28:49,106 --> 04:28:51,860
TRAVIS: Apparently, my hammer is talking to me.
Reckless attack.

5546
04:28:51,860 --> 04:28:53,746
MATT: All right.

5547
04:28:53,746 --> 04:28:55,447
TRAVIS: 23.

5548
04:28:55,447 --> 04:28:57,230
MATT: That hits.

5549
04:28:57,230 --> 04:28:59,960
TRAVIS: Okay. 17.

5550
04:28:59,960 --> 04:29:01,626
MATT: 17 damage? All righty.

5551
04:29:01,626 --> 04:29:05,281
TRAVIS: Last attack-- that tentacle's still fine,
right?

5552
04:29:05,281 --> 04:29:07,756
MATT: Yes it is, damaged, but it's still there.

5553
04:29:07,756 --> 04:29:10,915
TRAVIS: Yeah. All right, Reckless. 31.

5554
04:29:10,915 --> 04:29:12,237
MATT: 31 hits.

5555
04:29:12,237 --> 04:29:15,001
TRAVIS: Ten. 25.

5556
04:29:15,001 --> 04:29:17,753
MATT: 25. You destroy another tentacle, as three
are currently remaining.

5557
04:29:17,753 --> 04:29:21,616
SAM: One of them's around my neck.

5558
04:29:21,616 --> 04:29:25,341
TRAVIS: Yeah, so one of 'em's on Tary, and there
are two free?

5559
04:29:25,341 --> 04:29:26,526
MATT: Correct.

5560
04:29:26,526 --> 04:29:27,841
TRAVIS: Okay.

5561
04:29:27,841 --> 04:29:29,377
MATT: That ends your turn.

5562
04:29:29,377 --> 04:29:35,927
TRAVIS: I am going to use my not incredible speed
to just--

5563
04:29:35,927 --> 04:29:37,803
MATT: You used your full speed to move up to it.

5564
04:29:37,803 --> 04:29:39,406
TRAVIS: I'm gonna just end my turn.

5565
04:29:39,406 --> 04:29:40,337
MATT: Okay.

5566
04:29:40,337 --> 04:29:41,399
TRAVIS: Yep.

5567
04:29:41,399 --> 04:29:42,899
MATT: Taryon.

5568
04:29:42,899 --> 04:29:44,668
SAM: I mean, I mean--

5569
04:29:44,668 --> 04:29:46,013
TALIESIN: Do you have-- do you have a Hail Mary?

5570
04:29:46,013 --> 04:29:47,272
SAM: I mean-- No!

5571
04:29:47,272 --> 04:29:48,415
TALIESIN: This is-- wow.

5572
04:29:48,415 --> 04:29:57,919
SAM: No, I have-- my Hail Mary I did on my first
turn. I'm going to try to break free. I will put

5573
04:29:57,919 --> 04:30:02,692
my finger up right next to-- against the tentacle,
and just

5574
04:30:02,692 --> 04:30:06,115
use that Ring of the Ram, and just try to punch 
through it.

5575
04:30:06,115 --> 04:30:08,627
MATT: Okay. So, how many charges--

5576
04:30:08,627 --> 04:30:11,028
SAM: I regained three.

5577
04:30:11,028 --> 04:30:12,320
MATT: Okay, so you use all three charges?

5578
04:30:12,320 --> 04:30:13,560
SAM: I have all three charges.

5579
04:30:13,560 --> 04:30:16,403
MATT: Go for it. So go ahead and make your ranged
spell attack with disadvantage.

5580
04:30:16,403 --> 04:30:21,272
SAM: 12 plus nine is 21.

5581
04:30:21,272 --> 04:30:22,145
MATT: That hits! Go--

5582
04:30:22,145 --> 04:30:26,128
SAM: Oh wait, disadvantage, shit. That's less.
That's 17.

5583
04:30:26,128 --> 04:30:31,908
MATT: 17 just misses. You try and squeeze it by
and the ring releases and it smashes into the rock

5584
04:30:31,908 --> 04:30:37,292
and destroys part of the nearby plant life, which
then begins to just float away, chunks of rock and

5585
04:30:37,292 --> 04:30:39,934
sand, and some of the underground dark soot begins
to billow out.

5586
04:30:39,934 --> 04:30:42,200
The tentacle still remains affixed around you.

5587
04:30:42,200 --> 04:30:43,546
SAM: Terrible.

5588
04:30:43,546 --> 04:30:45,119
TALIESIN: Do you have a bonus action? Anything you
can--

5589
04:30:45,119 --> 04:30:46,057
MATT: All right.

5590
04:30:46,057 --> 04:30:51,321
SAM: I mean, I don't have any potions, or
anything, I-- nope, that's it.

5591
04:30:51,321 --> 04:30:54,926
MATT: It is going to use one of its legendary
actions to

5592
04:30:54,926 --> 04:30:56,962
attack Grog with one of its remaining tentacles.

5593
04:30:56,962 --> 04:30:58,688
LAURA: He's a defeatist, if I've ever seen it.

5594
04:30:58,688 --> 04:31:00,016
MATT: That is a 34.

5595
04:31:00,016 --> 04:31:01,478
TRAVIS: I think that hits.

5596
04:31:01,478 --> 04:31:04,285
MATT: Grog, you take 19 points of bludgeoning
damage, reduced to nine--

5597
04:31:04,285 --> 04:31:05,212
TRAVIS: Okay.

5598
04:31:05,212 --> 04:31:08,550
MATT: -- and you are grappled.

5599
04:31:08,550 --> 04:31:11,279
TALIESIN: It only has one more tentacle left that
is available.

5600
04:31:11,279 --> 04:31:14,981
MARISHA: We can't fucking kill it, you guys, don't
kill it.

5601
04:31:14,981 --> 04:31:17,062
TRAVIS: I would like to make a Retaliatory
Attack.

5602
04:31:17,062 --> 04:31:17,901
MATT: Okay.

5603
04:31:17,901 --> 04:31:19,185
TRAVIS: A Retali-tali--

5604
04:31:19,185 --> 04:31:20,556
TALIESIN: It can have no tentacles. It can still
feed.

5605
04:31:20,556 --> 04:31:21,752
MATT: Against?

5606
04:31:21,752 --> 04:31:22,639
TRAVIS: The one that grappled me.

5607
04:31:22,639 --> 04:31:23,537
MATT: Okay, go for it.

5608
04:31:23,537 --> 04:31:24,661
TALIESIN: They'll grow back.

5609
04:31:24,661 --> 04:31:25,571
TRAVIS: Reckless.

5610
04:31:25,571 --> 04:31:26,572
MARISHA: They won't grow back.

5611
04:31:26,572 --> 04:31:27,572
TRAVIS: That's a 31 again.

5612
04:31:27,572 --> 04:31:28,449
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

5613
04:31:28,449 --> 04:31:30,894
TRAVIS: Okay. 21.

5614
04:31:30,894 --> 04:31:33,959
MATT: 21 points of damage. You slam into it, it
looks like it's pulling apart, but the muscle's

5615
04:31:33,959 --> 04:31:39,072
still holding tight. Vax. I need you to make a
death saving throw with advantage.

5616
04:31:39,072 --> 04:31:41,027
MARISHA: Don't die.

5617
04:31:41,027 --> 04:31:43,825
MATT: Okay. Brings us to Keyleth.

5618
04:31:43,825 --> 04:31:44,804
TRAVIS: Did it work?

5619
04:31:44,804 --> 04:31:45,738
LAURA: Yeah.

5620
04:31:45,738 --> 04:31:46,771
MATT: You're back here.

5621
04:31:46,771 --> 04:31:48,302
MARISHA: Who's grappled and who's closest to the
portal?

5622
04:31:48,302 --> 04:31:50,567
MATT: Grog is closest to you, grappled, and there
is Taryon

5623
04:31:50,567 --> 04:31:54,003
on the other side, that you cannot quite see.

5624
04:31:54,003 --> 04:31:58,835
MARISHA: I still have Control Water up, correct?

5625
04:31:58,835 --> 04:32:02,400
MATT: You would, yes.

5626
04:32:02,400 --> 04:32:04,692
MARISHA: Taryon and Grog are both grappled?

5627
04:32:04,692 --> 04:32:05,260
LAURA: Yes.

5628
04:32:05,260 --> 04:32:08,406
MATT: Correct.

5629
04:32:08,406 --> 04:32:10,785
MARISHA: And I'm free underneath them?

5630
04:32:10,785 --> 04:32:11,522
LAURA: Yes.

5631
04:32:11,522 --> 04:32:12,691
MATT: You're free over here, yes.

5632
04:32:12,691 --> 04:32:13,800
LIAM: Yeah, you got loose.

5633
04:32:13,800 --> 04:32:14,993
SAM: You're the naga.

5634
04:32:14,993 --> 04:32:17,997
MARISHA: Okay. I used Alter Self originally,
correct?

5635
04:32:17,997 --> 04:32:18,869
MATT: Yes.

5636
04:32:18,869 --> 04:32:22,023
MARISHA: Alter Self. So I still have all my Beast
Shaping, correct?

5637
04:32:22,023 --> 04:32:22,774
MATT: Correct.

5638
04:32:22,774 --> 04:32:26,550
MARISHA: Okay.

5639
04:32:26,550 --> 04:32:28,804
MATT: Well, you have your beast shape you used to
turn into this form.

5640
04:32:28,804 --> 04:32:29,771
MARISHA: Huh?

5641
04:32:29,771 --> 04:32:31,123
MATT: Your Wild Shape you used to into this form.

5642
04:32:31,123 --> 04:32:32,512
SAM: You're a whale right now.

5643
04:32:32,512 --> 04:32:34,422
MARISHA: I didn't use Alter Self to do that?

5644
04:32:34,422 --> 04:32:35,096
SAM: No.

5645
04:32:35,096 --> 04:32:36,403
LAURA: You used Beast Form on that.

5646
04:32:36,403 --> 04:32:37,904
SAM: Alter Self doesn't do that.

5647
04:32:37,904 --> 04:32:38,779
MARISHA: Oh, okay cool.

5648
04:32:38,779 --> 04:32:40,434
MATT: Alter Self just gives you gills and fins,
you used--

5649
04:32:40,434 --> 04:32:41,788
LAURA: You used Beast Form to turn into a whale.

5650
04:32:41,788 --> 04:32:51,195
MARISHA: Sorry, sorry, sorry, I meant, sorry, I
meant-- Animal Shapes. No?

5651
04:32:51,195 --> 04:32:52,501
MATT: Animal Shapes you've already cast on
everybody--

5652
04:32:52,501 --> 04:32:54,055
MARISHA: I've used Animal Shapes to everybody?

5653
04:32:54,055 --> 04:32:54,699
LAURA: Yeah.

5654
04:32:54,699 --> 04:32:55,761
MATT: Right, but you lost concentration--

5655
04:32:55,761 --> 04:32:56,454
MARISHA: I used that to me, right.

5656
04:32:56,454 --> 04:32:57,493
MATT: -- when you went unconscious.

5657
04:32:57,493 --> 04:33:03,406
MARISHA: All right. Cool, cool, cool. Cool. Okay.
I'm gonna

5658
04:33:03,406 --> 04:33:11,650
try to get Grog out of the grasp again 
with my Grasping Vine.

5659
04:33:11,650 --> 04:33:13,577
MATT: Okay.

5660
04:33:13,577 --> 04:33:17,393
MARISHA: Bonus action first. See if I can--

5661
04:33:17,393 --> 04:33:19,303
MATT: Grasping Vine from where?

5662
04:33:19,303 --> 04:33:20,848
MARISHA: Okay.

5663
04:33:20,848 --> 04:33:23,396
MATT: You can have it come out of the ground here
if you want it to.

5664
04:33:23,396 --> 04:33:25,379
MARISHA: He's right here?

5665
04:33:25,379 --> 04:33:26,754
MATT: Grog is right here.

5666
04:33:26,754 --> 04:33:30,190
MARISHA: Correct? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I wanna be
over here-ish.

5667
04:33:30,190 --> 04:33:31,886
LAURA: You're pointing at the TV screen.

5668
04:33:31,886 --> 04:33:32,742
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5669
04:33:32,742 --> 04:33:33,833
SAM: (laughs)

5670
04:33:33,833 --> 04:33:37,397
MARISHA: Yeah. It's hard 'cause I don't literally
have access beyond this rock.

5671
04:33:37,397 --> 04:33:38,571
MATT: So pulling up this way?

5672
04:33:38,571 --> 04:33:41,126
MARISHA: On the other side of that, closest to the
portal? Yeah.

5673
04:33:41,126 --> 04:33:41,987
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5674
04:33:41,987 --> 04:33:43,365
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's what I want.

5675
04:33:43,365 --> 04:33:44,625
MATT: Okay, so we'll say, pulling this way.

5676
04:33:44,625 --> 04:33:45,421
MARISHA: Yeah.

5677
04:33:45,421 --> 04:33:48,321
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll a d20 plus your
wisdom modifier.

5678
04:33:48,321 --> 04:33:53,555
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil!

5679
04:33:53,555 --> 04:33:55,287
TALIESIN: Oh.

5680
04:33:55,287 --> 04:34:04,386
MARISHA: What is that? What is that? Not-- What is
that? What is that?

5681
04:34:04,386 --> 04:34:06,859
TALIESIN: Oh, that's good! Okay, yeah, that's
really hard to see, sorry, 'cause of the light.

5682
04:34:06,859 --> 04:34:10,569
That's a 17.

5683
04:34:10,569 --> 04:34:11,727
LIAM: Plus your wisdom modifier.

5684
04:34:11,727 --> 04:34:12,579
MARISHA: That is a 17?

5685
04:34:12,579 --> 04:34:13,555
TALIESIN: That is a 17, yes.

5686
04:34:13,555 --> 04:34:14,817
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5687
04:34:14,817 --> 04:34:16,029
LIAM: 17 plus.

5688
04:34:16,029 --> 04:34:20,844
MARISHA: Sorry, I don't want to feel insane. Plus
my wisdom modifier.

5689
04:34:20,844 --> 04:34:21,579
LIAM: Yes.

5690
04:34:21,579 --> 04:34:22,494
MATT: Correct.

5691
04:34:22,494 --> 04:34:23,570
MARISHA: (nervous laugh)

5692
04:34:23,570 --> 04:34:24,512
MATT: Which is?

5693
04:34:24,512 --> 04:34:26,063
MARISHA: 30-- sorry, 28! 28!

5694
04:34:26,063 --> 04:34:29,334
MATT: Your Wisdom modifier is plus six, right?

5695
04:34:29,334 --> 04:34:35,494
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry, not a saving
throw, so 20-- 17 plus six, which is 25?

5696
04:34:35,494 --> 04:34:40,548
MATT: All right, so you pull Grog this way, and
with Grasping--

5697
04:34:40,548 --> 04:34:41,930
LAURA: 23.

5698
04:34:41,930 --> 04:34:43,546
MATT: -- Vine, that's a range of what?

5699
04:34:43,546 --> 04:34:45,026
MARISHA: 23? 17 plus five-- six?

5700
04:34:45,026 --> 04:34:46,036
MATT: What's the range of your Grasping Vine?

5701
04:34:46,036 --> 04:34:47,059
LIAM: The range. The range of Grasping Vine.

5702
04:34:47,059 --> 04:34:48,143
MATT: How long-- how far does it pull?

5703
04:34:48,143 --> 04:34:52,259
MARISHA: It's a 30-foot range, with another
30-foot range coming from me. So 60 foot total.

5704
04:34:52,259 --> 04:34:55,731
MATT: Right. So you-- okay, you can pull him out
of the range, it does break--

5705
04:34:55,731 --> 04:34:56,899
MARISHA: 30 foot.

5706
04:34:56,899 --> 04:35:00,270
MATT: Yeah. So you do break the grapple on Grog,
and pull him away from that.

5707
04:35:00,270 --> 04:35:01,634
TALIESIN: Drinking again.

5708
04:35:01,634 --> 04:35:02,577
MARISHA: Okay.

5709
04:35:02,577 --> 04:35:03,693
MATT: All right. So your movement.

5710
04:35:03,693 --> 04:35:05,216
MARISHA: And then I have my action, and my
movement.

5711
04:35:05,216 --> 04:35:06,325
MATT: Correct.

5712
04:35:06,325 --> 04:35:08,900
MARISHA: And I'm a normal person right now, or am
I a whale?

5713
04:35:08,900 --> 04:35:11,168
MATT: No. You're a whale, still. You haven't taken
any damage. You just got pushed away.

5714
04:35:11,168 --> 04:35:12,921
MARISHA: Okay.

5715
04:35:12,921 --> 04:35:14,912
MATT: Which actually, technically, in whale form
you couldn't cast the spell.

5716
04:35:14,912 --> 04:35:16,271
MARISHA: I wouldn't be able to cast the spell.

5717
04:35:16,271 --> 04:35:17,391
MATT: So would you drop your form?

5718
04:35:17,391 --> 04:35:18,208
MARISHA: Yeah.

5719
04:35:18,208 --> 04:35:19,054
SAM: For sure.

5720
04:35:19,054 --> 04:35:19,724
MATT: Okay. So Keyleth--

5721
04:35:19,724 --> 04:35:20,610
MARISHA: Yeah, I would definitely drop the form.

5722
04:35:20,610 --> 04:35:23,251
MATT: Keyleth is back into that, cast the spell.

5723
04:35:23,251 --> 04:35:25,304
MARISHA: And then I have another spell. Correct?

5724
04:35:25,304 --> 04:35:26,656
MATT: You have your-- well, you have your-- you
can cast your--

5725
04:35:26,656 --> 04:35:27,553
MARISHA: Second level or lower.

5726
04:35:27,553 --> 04:35:29,517
MATT: -- second level or lower as your action, and
you have your movement still.

5727
04:35:29,517 --> 04:35:32,797
MARISHA: So-- fuckin' A, this is complicated.
Okay.

5728
04:35:32,797 --> 04:35:43,420
Then I would cast, oh, shit. I got Grog out. 
Who's almost dead?

5729
04:35:43,420 --> 04:35:44,955
LAURA: Well, Vax is inside of the kraken.

5730
04:35:44,955 --> 04:35:45,988
TALIESIN: Vax.

5731
04:35:45,988 --> 04:35:47,145
TRAVIS: Vax is inside--

5732
04:35:47,145 --> 04:35:50,978
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't know if I can do anything
about that right now, though.

5733
04:35:50,978 --> 04:35:54,032
I can cast a second level or lower-- 
oh my god, this is awful.

5734
04:35:54,032 --> 04:35:55,886
SAM: Just heal yourself.

5735
04:35:55,886 --> 04:35:59,571
MARISHA: All right. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll
heal myself--

5736
04:35:59,571 --> 04:36:06,949
sorry, for another Healing Word level two-- 
last level two spell.

5737
04:36:06,949 --> 04:36:09,715
MATT: Okay. And you're gonna move towards the--

5738
04:36:09,715 --> 04:36:15,379
MARISHA: I'm gonna move-- no, I'm gonna stay close
towards the kraken.

5739
04:36:15,379 --> 04:36:16,684
MATT: So you're gonna stay here?

5740
04:36:16,684 --> 04:36:17,853
MARISHA: Yeah.

5741
04:36:17,853 --> 04:36:19,825
MATT: Or move towards the kraken? Are you not
moving?

5742
04:36:19,825 --> 04:36:20,821
MARISHA: Where am I?

5743
04:36:20,821 --> 04:36:21,635
MATT: You're right here.

5744
04:36:21,635 --> 04:36:22,578
LIAM: It's hard to see on the screen.

5745
04:36:22,578 --> 04:36:24,921
MARISHA: You're actually not even on the screen.

5746
04:36:24,921 --> 04:36:25,891
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5747
04:36:25,891 --> 04:36:26,999
MATT: Right, but you can see my fingers.

5748
04:36:26,999 --> 04:36:30,656
MARISHA: I can see your fingers-- let me move
closer towards the kraken and towards the portal.

5749
04:36:30,656 --> 04:36:33,098
MATT: There you go.

5750
04:36:33,098 --> 04:36:34,201
MARISHA: And that's all I'll do.

5751
04:36:34,201 --> 04:36:35,532
MATT: So we'll say there.

5752
04:36:35,532 --> 04:36:38,529
MATT: Okay. Got you. Top of the lair action--

5753
04:36:38,529 --> 04:36:40,501
MARISHA: And I heal myself, sorry, level two--

5754
04:36:40,501 --> 04:36:41,520
MATT: Yes. Do that.

5755
04:36:41,520 --> 04:36:43,377
MARISHA: -- which is 2d8. Healing Word.

5756
04:36:43,377 --> 04:36:46,838
MATT: All right. I need everybody to make--

5757
04:36:46,838 --> 04:36:47,711
SAM: Oh boy.

5758
04:36:47,711 --> 04:36:49,056
MARISHA: Sorry. 2d4.

5759
04:36:49,056 --> 04:36:50,920
MATT: -- a constitution saving throw.

5760
04:36:50,920 --> 04:36:55,034
MARISHA: That's-- both ones. That sucks. One plus
six--

5761
04:36:55,034 --> 04:36:55,886
SAM: 12!

5762
04:36:55,886 --> 04:36:56,932
TRAVIS: I'm not Blessed anymore, am I?

5763
04:36:56,932 --> 04:36:58,292
MATT: 13 points of lightning damage.

5764
04:36:58,292 --> 04:36:59,220
SAM: Great.

5765
04:36:59,220 --> 04:37:00,162
MATT: Percival.

5766
04:37:00,162 --> 04:37:01,184
TALIESIN: I'm not there.

5767
04:37:01,184 --> 04:37:04,939
MATT: You're not there. That's right. Keyleth.
Constitution saving throw.

5768
04:37:04,939 --> 04:37:06,011
LIAM: Roll a d20.

5769
04:37:06,011 --> 04:37:09,076
MARISHA: Natural one.

5770
04:37:09,076 --> 04:37:10,034
MATT: 13 points of lightning damage.

5771
04:37:10,034 --> 04:37:11,288
MARISHA: 13?

5772
04:37:11,288 --> 04:37:13,813
MATT: 13. Vex.

5773
04:37:13,813 --> 04:37:15,529
MARISHA: I had 12 hit points, so I'm unconscious.

5774
04:37:15,529 --> 04:37:17,415
TRAVIS: Didn't you just heal yourself a little bit
more, though?

5775
04:37:17,415 --> 04:37:18,223
TALIESIN: For 12.

5776
04:37:18,223 --> 04:37:19,314
MARISHA: I-- for 12. And now I'm zero.

5777
04:37:19,314 --> 04:37:21,894
LIAM: But you would have 20--

5778
04:37:21,894 --> 04:37:23,306
MATT: Wait, wait, you were at five before.

5779
04:37:23,306 --> 04:37:24,423
LIAM: You were at five. You couldn't have been at
zero.

5780
04:37:24,423 --> 04:37:25,493
MARISHA: And then I healed seven.

5781
04:37:25,493 --> 04:37:26,654
LIAM: Oh, to seven to get to 12.

5782
04:37:26,654 --> 04:37:27,423
LAURA and MATT: Ooh.

5783
04:37:27,423 --> 04:37:28,504
MARISHA: And I healed seven 'cause I rolled two
ones.

5784
04:37:28,504 --> 04:37:29,755
MATT: Yeah, Keyleth goes unconscious.

5785
04:37:29,755 --> 04:37:34,122
MARISHA: So-- no, no, no, wait-- I rolled two ones
on my d4s.

5786
04:37:34,122 --> 04:37:35,014
MATT: Yes.

5787
04:37:35,014 --> 04:37:35,851
MARISHA: And I have--

5788
04:37:35,851 --> 04:37:36,975
TALIESIN: Six plus two.

5789
04:37:36,975 --> 04:37:38,067
MARISHA: -- a plus six, so that's actually eight.

5790
04:37:38,067 --> 04:37:39,062
MATT: Eight?

5791
04:37:39,062 --> 04:37:40,161
MARISHA: Do I have one hit point left?

5792
04:37:40,161 --> 04:37:41,223
TALIESIN: You're at one hit point, you're at one
hit point.

5793
04:37:41,223 --> 04:37:42,554
MARISHA: Is that accurate?

5794
04:37:42,554 --> 04:37:43,519
SAM: Eight plus five is--

5795
04:37:43,519 --> 04:37:44,278
TALIESIN: Yes.

5796
04:37:44,278 --> 04:37:45,448
SAM: -- eight plus five is 13, you just took 13
hit points.

5797
04:37:45,448 --> 04:37:46,292
MATT: You're zero.

5798
04:37:46,292 --> 04:37:47,410
LAURA: So you're at zero.

5799
04:37:47,410 --> 04:37:48,572
TALIESIN: You're at zero. Never mind. Fuck.

5800
04:37:48,572 --> 04:37:49,453
MATT: You just fall unconscious.

5801
04:37:49,453 --> 04:37:50,450
LAURA: You're at zero.

5802
04:37:50,450 --> 04:37:51,446
MARISHA: I'm at zero.

5803
04:37:51,446 --> 04:37:52,161
TALIESIN: Okay.

5804
04:37:52,161 --> 04:37:52,826
MATT: All righty.

5805
04:37:52,826 --> 04:37:54,259
MARISHA: God f-- damn it.

5806
04:37:54,259 --> 04:37:55,219
LAURA: I rolled a 20.

5807
04:37:55,219 --> 04:37:55,909
MATT: A 20?

5808
04:37:55,909 --> 04:37:56,786
LAURA: Yeah.

5809
04:37:56,786 --> 04:37:58,016
MATT: All right, so you take 13 points lightning
damage.

5810
04:37:58,016 --> 04:37:59,712
LAURA: Okay, and Trinket rolled a-- like a four.

5811
04:37:59,712 --> 04:38:00,884
MATT: 13 points of lightning damage.

5812
04:38:00,884 --> 04:38:01,584
LAURA: Cool.

5813
04:38:01,584 --> 04:38:03,031
TRAVIS: 20-- 23 and resistance.

5814
04:38:03,031 --> 04:38:05,769
MATT: All right, so that's 11--

5815
04:38:05,769 --> 04:38:06,761
TALIESIN: It's gonna come down to Grog.

5816
04:38:06,761 --> 04:38:14,215
MATT: -- six points of lightning damage to you,
Grog. All right, so Control Water is dropped.

5817
04:38:14,215 --> 04:38:18,046
MARISHA: Get out. Out.

5818
04:38:18,046 --> 04:38:19,163
MATT: That ends--

5819
04:38:19,163 --> 04:38:20,300
TRAVIS: Me?

5820
04:38:20,300 --> 04:38:21,480
MARISHA: Get out. Get out.

5821
04:38:21,480 --> 04:38:22,248
MATT: -- Keyleth's turn. The 20 count.

5822
04:38:22,248 --> 04:38:23,243
TRAVIS: What about him?

5823
04:38:23,243 --> 04:38:24,333
MATT: Vex, what are you doing?

5824
04:38:24,333 --> 04:38:25,328
MARISHA: You're all-- I've got him. You've got
three lodestones.

5825
04:38:25,328 --> 04:38:26,144
LAURA: I saw--

5826
04:38:26,144 --> 04:38:26,785
TALIESIN: You don't have--

5827
04:38:26,785 --> 04:38:27,718
MATT: You saw Keyleth just go--

5828
04:38:27,718 --> 04:38:28,242
TRAVIS: I only have one.

5829
04:38:28,242 --> 04:38:29,132
MARISHA: You and him.

5830
04:38:29,132 --> 04:38:30,485
MATT: -- get shocked as the burst of electrical
energy shoots through the area, and she just kinda

5831
04:38:30,485 --> 04:38:34,674
goes limp again, and is kind of floating in
space.

5832
04:38:34,674 --> 04:38:39,002
LAURA: And I saw Vax get swallowed? Did I see that
happen?

5833
04:38:39,002 --> 04:38:40,691
MATT: You would've just barely seen it over your
shoulder.

5834
04:38:40,691 --> 04:38:44,466
And heard someone say it over the earpiece.

5835
04:38:44,466 --> 04:39:00,983
LAURA: I-- fuckin' A. I swim up, and I swim-- god
damn it.

5836
04:39:00,983 --> 04:39:05,262
MATT: You have your bonus action for a dash if you
want to try and get closer, it's up to you.

5837
04:39:05,262 --> 04:39:16,596
LAURA: I'm gonna try to shoot thorns, I guess,
Hail of Thorns, maybe?

5838
04:39:16,596 --> 04:39:24,365
Actually, I'm gonna try-- yeah. I'm gonna try--

5839
04:39:24,365 --> 04:39:25,678
MATT: What are you doing?

5840
04:39:25,678 --> 04:39:30,298
LAURA: -- to shoot Hail of Thorns at-- directly at
his mouth. I don't know, try to get him to like,

5841
04:39:30,298 --> 04:39:34,649
do something to let go. Spit it up. It's the
stupidest plan.

5842
04:39:34,649 --> 04:39:39,768
I know. But, I'm not thinking clearly, 
my brother's got fucking swallowed.

5843
04:39:39,768 --> 04:39:42,039
MATT: Okay, what level Hail of Thorns?

5844
04:39:42,039 --> 04:39:51,113
LAURA: I'm gonna do it at-- Oh, everything within
five feet, and Keyleth is in five feet.

5845
04:39:51,113 --> 04:39:52,690
MATT: No, Keyleth is over here.

5846
04:39:52,690 --> 04:39:54,260
LAURA: Okay. Is anything within five feet?

5847
04:39:54,260 --> 04:39:55,363
MATT: Currently, no.

5848
04:39:55,363 --> 04:39:59,944
LAURA: Okay. Then I'm gonna-- I'm gonna cast it at
fourth level.

5849
04:39:59,944 --> 04:40:01,690
MATT: Fourth level?

5850
04:40:01,690 --> 04:40:02,757
LAURA: Yeah.

5851
04:40:02,757 --> 04:40:04,503
MATT: You still have a fourth-level spell?

5852
04:40:04,503 --> 04:40:05,422
LAURA: Oh no, I did Grasping Vine.

5853
04:40:05,422 --> 04:40:06,309
MATT: You did.

5854
04:40:06,309 --> 04:40:07,316
LAURA: Did I?

5855
04:40:07,316 --> 04:40:07,992
MATT: That's when you pull--

5856
04:40:07,992 --> 04:40:08,965
LAURA: No, I didn't.

5857
04:40:08,965 --> 04:40:10,083
MARISHA: That was me.

5858
04:40:10,083 --> 04:40:10,951
LAURA: No, I did Conjure Animals.

5859
04:40:10,951 --> 04:40:11,717
MATT: That's right, you did.

5860
04:40:11,717 --> 04:40:12,567
LAURA: So fourth level.

5861
04:40:12,567 --> 04:40:17,323
MATT: Yeah, okay, fourth level? So that is an
additional 4d10

5862
04:40:17,323 --> 04:40:30,735
piercing damage towards the attack. 
Go ahead and roll the attack.

5863
04:40:30,735 --> 04:40:33,687
LAURA: 23?

5864
04:40:33,687 --> 04:40:35,241
MATT: 23 is the disadvantage?

5865
04:40:35,241 --> 04:40:36,114
LAURA: Yeah.

5866
04:40:36,114 --> 04:40:37,379
MATT: Okay, that hits.

5867
04:40:37,379 --> 04:40:53,191
LAURA: 11 plus three lightning and then-- how
many? 4d10?

5868
04:40:53,191 --> 04:40:54,742
MATT: 4d10.

5869
04:40:54,742 --> 04:41:04,860
LAURA: 18.

5870
04:41:04,860 --> 04:41:09,104
MATT: Okay, plus 18 points of damage. So as you
fire the arrow, it sinks into the side of its

5871
04:41:09,104 --> 04:41:13,731
mouth, just bursts with thorns in the vicinity.
Kind of roils, but it doesn't seem to have any

5872
04:41:13,731 --> 04:41:17,931
effect. You have your secondary attack if you want
to.

5873
04:41:17,931 --> 04:41:23,212
LAURA: Yeah, I guess I'm gonna try to shoot at his
eye.

5874
04:41:23,212 --> 04:41:32,417
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll.

5875
04:41:32,417 --> 04:41:33,410
LAURA: 29.

5876
04:41:33,410 --> 04:41:34,891
MATT: 29 hits.

5877
04:41:34,891 --> 04:41:48,711
LAURA: 16, plus four lightning, nothing.

5878
04:41:48,711 --> 04:41:55,289
MATT: Okay.

5879
04:41:55,289 --> 04:41:58,251
LAURA: And I'm gonna-- This is so stupid. I'm
gonna swim back down

5880
04:41:58,251 --> 04:42:00,354
and try to hide. I've got nothing.

5881
04:42:00,354 --> 04:42:02,984
MATT: You already used your bonus action,
unfortunately. To cast the spell.

5882
04:42:02,984 --> 04:42:07,664
LAURA: Yes, I did. I'm gonna stand right there and
say, fuck you, let go of my brother.

5883
04:42:07,664 --> 04:42:10,460
MATT: Okay. Percival, you're on the other side of
the portal, looking through and you're watch--

5884
04:42:10,460 --> 04:42:12,687
TALIESIN: How long-- Can I see what's going on?

5885
04:42:12,687 --> 04:42:16,657
MATT: I mean, you get a slight-- If you peek out
the side. It's still obscured and like, the water--

5886
04:42:16,657 --> 04:42:17,846
TALIESIN: And it's only been six seconds.

5887
04:42:17,846 --> 04:42:20,827
MATT: The Daylight spell is still kinda shooting
out from underneath, so it's this beacon of light

5888
04:42:20,827 --> 04:42:25,701
in the underwater area. So you get a decent view
of what's going on. You see Keyleth kinda go limp

5889
04:42:25,701 --> 04:42:29,935
in the distance. You see Grog there. You see Vex
trying to shoot.

5890
04:42:29,935 --> 04:42:41,824
TALIESIN: No. (inhales) I'm gonna try and-- how
far do I have on that? I'm gonna try and stick my

5891
04:42:41,824 --> 04:42:51,678
head through the portal. I'm gonna try and cast
Minor Illusion? In front of the beast?

5892
04:42:51,678 --> 04:42:53,406
MATT: Okay.

5893
04:42:53,406 --> 04:42:57,442
TALIESIN: It can't be complicated, can it? It's
gotta be small.

5894
04:42:57,442 --> 04:42:59,039
MATT: Nope. It is a cantrip.

5895
04:42:59,039 --> 04:43:05,870
TALIESIN: It's a cantrip, so it's nothing. It's
nothing fancy. I'm just gonna try and make a big

5896
04:43:05,870 --> 04:43:11,102
meaty target appear. Just like a thing that looks
like-- I'm gonna try and do like the shape of some

5897
04:43:11,102 --> 04:43:15,677
aquatic animal? A small-- anything to try and get
right in its face?

5898
04:43:15,677 --> 04:43:20,154
MATT: You concentrate through the portal and you
watch just short of about 30 feet past you, a

5899
04:43:20,154 --> 04:43:24,107
little shimmering space looks almost like a fish
but it's sort of translucent and blob-like.

5900
04:43:24,107 --> 04:43:26,378
TALIESIN: God damn it.

5901
04:43:26,378 --> 04:43:28,877
MATT: It's not really gonna help in this
situation. Sorry.

5902
04:43:28,877 --> 04:43:38,392
TALIESIN: I got-- Other than-- Yeah, I got
nothing. Other than trying to distract it.

5903
04:43:38,392 --> 04:43:40,845
MATT: All right. End of your turn?

5904
04:43:40,845 --> 04:43:43,413
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5905
04:43:43,413 --> 04:43:44,988
MATT: It's going to use--

5906
04:43:44,988 --> 04:43:46,476
TALIESIN: I pull back through the portal,
obviously, but.

5907
04:43:46,476 --> 04:43:50,092
MATT: All righty. As you pull back through and it
returns, it's gonna ahead and use-- It's taking

5908
04:43:50,202 --> 04:43:58,009
another legendary action to make a-- This is gonna
be a tentacle attack against you, Grog?

5909
04:43:58,009 --> 04:43:59,412
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5910
04:43:59,412 --> 04:44:03,169
MATT: With advantage, that's going to be nine plus
18, that's 27?

5911
04:44:03,169 --> 04:44:05,126
TRAVIS: That hits.

5912
04:44:05,126 --> 04:44:10,871
MATT: You take 12 points of bludgeoning damage
plus ten, that's 22. Divided by that. 11.

5913
04:44:10,871 --> 04:44:11,868
TRAVIS: 11.

5914
04:44:11,868 --> 04:44:12,511
MATT: All right, Percy's--

5915
04:44:12,511 --> 04:44:14,340
TRAVIS: Can I make a retalito-ri-teh?

5916
04:44:14,340 --> 04:44:15,310
MATT: You already used it.

5917
04:44:15,310 --> 04:44:16,195
TRAVIS: I did.

5918
04:44:16,195 --> 04:44:16,864
MATT: Sorry.

5919
04:44:16,864 --> 04:44:18,216
SAM: Retali-tali-tah?

5920
04:44:18,216 --> 04:44:22,410
MATT: It is now the Kraken's turn. At the top of
the round, you lose a death saving throw?

5921
04:44:22,410 --> 04:44:23,717
SAM: To what?

5922
04:44:23,717 --> 04:44:24,924
MATT: As the acid begins to slowly burn away--

5923
04:44:24,924 --> 04:44:26,228
LAURA: Oh yeah, this is gonna be--

5924
04:44:26,228 --> 04:44:28,318
MATT: Oh no, I mean like, you lose one. As the
acid burns.

5925
04:44:28,380 --> 04:44:29,467
LIAM: Oh, it just goes. Okay.

5926
04:44:29,467 --> 04:44:36,773
MATT: The acid is slowly digesting you. It's gonna
move four, five, ten, 15, 25, 30. We'll say for

5927
04:44:36,773 --> 04:44:42,594
the purposes of this, you're right there, Grog.
Space is getting a little cluttered over there.

5928
04:44:42,594 --> 04:44:45,299
TRAVIS: Am I grappled or did he just bitch slap
me?

5929
04:44:45,299 --> 04:44:46,449
MATT: I mean, it hit you and grappled you.

5930
04:44:46,449 --> 04:44:47,349
TRAVIS: Okay, cool.

5931
04:44:47,349 --> 04:44:48,574
MATT: One of its remaining tentacles--

5932
04:44:48,574 --> 04:44:49,739
TALIESIN: Is Tary-- Tary's still held on?

5933
04:44:49,739 --> 04:44:50,621
MATT: Tary is--

5934
04:44:50,621 --> 04:44:51,542
SAM: Being pulled around.

5935
04:44:51,542 --> 04:44:52,459
TRAVIS: Hah!

5936
04:44:52,459 --> 04:44:54,055
MATT: You're being pulled up over the rock and
dragged across.

5937
04:44:54,055 --> 04:44:55,698
LIAM and LAURA: (make impact noises)

5938
04:44:55,698 --> 04:45:06,271
MATT: Like, oh god. Over there. That's a 34. You
take-- this shit's getting intense.

5939
04:45:06,371 --> 04:45:07,583
TALIESIN: (groans)

5940
04:45:07,583 --> 04:45:08,584
MATT: Oh my god.

5941
04:45:08,584 --> 04:45:09,931
LIAM: Getting intense? Jesus.

5942
04:45:09,931 --> 04:45:11,076
MATT: (laughs) That is--

5943
04:45:11,076 --> 04:45:14,300
MARISHA: God damn it.

5944
04:45:14,300 --> 04:45:16,963
MATT: -- 29 points of piercing damage, halved--

5945
04:45:16,963 --> 04:45:17,906
TRAVIS: Okay, so that's?

5946
04:45:17,906 --> 04:45:18,962
MATT: To 14--

5947
04:45:18,962 --> 04:45:20,216
TRAVIS: 14.

5948
04:45:20,216 --> 04:45:23,287
MATT: And it swallows you a second time.

5949
04:45:23,287 --> 04:45:24,353
TALIESIN: Good!

5950
04:45:24,353 --> 04:45:25,380
LAURA: Good, then you can get Vax out.

5951
04:45:25,380 --> 04:45:26,390
MARISHA: Yeah, you can get Vax out.

5952
04:45:26,390 --> 04:45:27,567
MATT: Pulling you into its body--

5953
04:45:27,567 --> 04:45:28,681
TALIESIN: Good! I approve of this.

5954
04:45:28,681 --> 04:45:30,616
TRAVIS: You guys think this is part of a plan.

5955
04:45:30,616 --> 04:45:33,724
MATT: You are consumed and restrained once again
in its dark space inside as you're pulled into the--

5956
04:45:33,724 --> 04:45:36,043
TRAVIS: Fuck this tiny hole shit.

5957
04:45:36,043 --> 04:45:37,677
LAURA: (laughs)

5958
04:45:37,677 --> 04:45:39,017
MATT: That ends its turn, Grog, you're up.

5959
04:45:39,017 --> 04:45:41,354
TRAVIS: Ah, it's my turn now? I don't even get
like a second to think about it?

5960
04:45:41,354 --> 04:45:45,343
MATT: Nope! Ah, as you're pulled inside the voice
comes up again and it's now emanating outward to

5961
04:45:45,343 --> 04:45:52,359
you as well, Vex, and in the unconscious darkness
of Vax and Keyleth, the voice just says,

5962
04:45:52,359 --> 04:45:59,117
"I've been here a long time, and I'll be here 
long after you are dust.

5963
04:45:59,117 --> 04:46:09,238
"Feed me and give me sustenance, I'll find my
way through somehow." Grog?

5964
04:46:09,238 --> 04:46:16,550
TRAVIS: I take a greater healing potion. Can I
reach Vax at all?

5965
04:46:16,550 --> 04:46:21,384
Can I find any part of his foot or 
anything and pull him down to me?

5966
04:46:21,384 --> 04:46:29,388
MATT: All right, so-- you can either reach around
for him, try and feel for him--

5967
04:46:29,388 --> 04:46:31,977
you can take a healing potion as a bonus 
action if you'd like.

5968
04:46:31,977 --> 04:46:32,974
TRAVIS: It's not for me.

5969
04:46:32,974 --> 04:46:38,177
MATT: Oh, it's not for you? You can make an
investigation check to try and find him.

5970
04:46:38,177 --> 04:46:41,811
This is gonna be your action to do so.

5971
04:46:41,811 --> 04:46:45,787
TRAVIS: Is he rough at all? Even close?

5972
04:46:45,787 --> 04:46:46,968
LIAM and LAURA: The kraken.

5973
04:46:46,968 --> 04:46:52,662
MATT: The kraken? Not from what you've seen. You
guys haven't been doing focusing damage, you've

5974
04:46:52,662 --> 04:46:58,964
been trying to move around him. He's lost a number
of tentacles, but--

5975
04:46:58,964 --> 04:47:03,056
TRAVIS: Right, and those tentacles-- the tentacles
don't count towards his overall damage?

5976
04:47:03,056 --> 04:47:03,686
MATT: No, they do.

5977
04:47:03,686 --> 04:47:04,567
TALIESIN: They do, but--

5978
04:47:04,567 --> 04:47:08,963
TRAVIS: (sighs loudly)

5979
04:47:08,963 --> 04:47:15,651
What a choice. I am going to-- fuck it,
I'm gonna make an investigation check for Vax.

5980
04:47:15,651 --> 04:47:22,091
MATT: Go for it.

5981
04:47:22,091 --> 04:47:23,167
LAURA: (groans)

5982
04:47:23,167 --> 04:47:26,663
TRAVIS: That's a big natural one.

5983
04:47:26,663 --> 04:47:31,135
MATT: Feeling around inside, you're unable to find
any current form of Vax right now.

5984
04:47:31,135 --> 04:47:33,810
However, you still have your bonus action 
and you are frenzied.

5985
04:47:33,810 --> 04:47:36,446
LIAM: Take that fucking potion. Take it.

5986
04:47:36,446 --> 04:47:38,691
TRAVIS: All right, I'll take the potion myself.

5987
04:47:38,691 --> 04:47:40,704
MATT: All righty.

5988
04:47:40,704 --> 04:47:41,718
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5989
04:47:41,718 --> 04:47:42,945
MATT: So, what potion is it?

5990
04:47:42,945 --> 04:47:45,125
TRAVIS: It's a greater, my last greater

5991
04:47:45,125 --> 04:47:47,661
MATT: All right, 4d4 plus four hit points.

5992
04:47:47,661 --> 04:47:52,526
TRAVIS: 4d4 plus four.

5993
04:47:52,526 --> 04:47:54,556
LAURA: So that's 48 hit points healed!

5994
04:47:54,556 --> 04:47:56,172
TRAVIS: Seven, eight--

5995
04:47:56,172 --> 04:48:00,012
SAM: (laughs) Thanks, Laura.

5996
04:48:00,012 --> 04:48:01,639
TRAVIS: 11, 12.

5997
04:48:01,639 --> 04:48:02,762
MATT: Oh, Laura, do you want your shark to do
anything, by the way?

5998
04:48:02,762 --> 04:48:03,595
TRAVIS: 16.

5999
04:48:03,595 --> 04:48:04,298
SAM: Nailed it!

6000
04:48:04,298 --> 04:48:05,297
TRAVIS: 16 points of healing.

6001
04:48:05,297 --> 04:48:09,805
LAURA: Yeah, I want it to go and try and attack
the tentacle that is holding Tary.

6002
04:48:09,805 --> 04:48:17,310
SAM: The shark? Hello, shark friend! Aquatic
ally!

6003
04:48:17,310 --> 04:48:18,778
LIAM: I'll be back.

6004
04:48:18,778 --> 04:48:21,775
LAURA: 21? No, 22.

6005
04:48:21,775 --> 04:48:29,001
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

6006
04:48:29,001 --> 04:48:31,510
LAURA: 14.

6007
04:48:31,510 --> 04:48:34,660
MATT: 14 points of damage, that was one that had
previously taken 22 points of damage--

6008
04:48:34,789 --> 04:48:35,716
SAM: Ooh!

6009
04:48:35,716 --> 04:48:38,908
MATT: the shark actually does tear the tentacle
free, so technically Taryon, before you're about

6010
04:48:38,908 --> 04:48:41,732
to get dragged over the coals of the top of this,
before the shark

6011
04:48:41,732 --> 04:48:44,908
actually tore into and removed your grapple from--

6012
04:48:44,908 --> 04:48:48,475
TALIESIN: And Trinket runs.

6013
04:48:48,475 --> 04:48:49,950
MATT: It is down to two tentacles.

6014
04:48:49,950 --> 04:48:50,942
LAURA: Trinket runs--

6015
04:48:50,942 --> 04:48:51,692
SAM: Wow.

6016
04:48:51,692 --> 04:48:53,232
LAURA: -- oh yeah, and Trinket ran towards the
door

6017
04:48:53,232 --> 04:48:57,065
MARISHA: To the door, Taryon.

6018
04:48:57,065 --> 04:48:58,116
SAM: I can't hear anything.

6019
04:48:58,116 --> 04:48:59,092
MATT: Four here, four there.

6020
04:48:59,092 --> 04:49:00,476
TALIESIN: Well, and she's unconscious.

6021
04:49:00,476 --> 04:49:04,958
SAM: (laughs) I can't really see the layout-- is
it my turn, by the way?

6022
04:49:04,958 --> 04:49:05,903
MATT: It is your turn now, yeah.

6023
04:49:05,903 --> 04:49:09,675
SAM: I can't really see the layout of that rock,
can I see through it? Is there an under that I can--

6024
04:49:09,675 --> 04:49:16,327
MATT: There is actually-- there is a small, kind
of under-- kind of a low bridge.

6025
04:49:16,327 --> 04:49:20,882
SAM: Well, ball sack. I can't move very fast now,
can I?

6026
04:49:20,882 --> 04:49:23,630
MATT: You can move 15 feet, as you swim through.

6027
04:49:23,630 --> 04:49:28,950
SAM: Can I wiggle through, under the little
outcropping there, and get to the other side?

6028
04:49:28,950 --> 04:49:30,511
MATT: 15. You can just get out to that side,
yeah.

6029
04:49:30,511 --> 04:49:33,148
SAM: Do I have a clean line of sight on him?

6030
04:49:33,148 --> 04:49:33,824
MATT: On the kraken?

6031
04:49:33,824 --> 04:49:34,543
SAM: Yeah.

6032
04:49:34,543 --> 04:49:35,511
MATT: Yes, you do.

6033
04:49:35,511 --> 04:49:40,416
SAM: Okay. I mean-- I can't really--

6034
04:49:40,416 --> 04:49:42,696
TALIESIN: How many tentacles does the kraken have
now?

6035
04:49:42,696 --> 04:49:44,123
MATT: Two more.

6036
04:49:44,123 --> 04:49:47,802
SAM: If I shoot the thing, the people inside will
die. (nervous laugh)

6037
04:49:47,802 --> 04:49:50,626
LAURA: I don't know about that, it might keep them
from getting digested

6038
04:49:50,626 --> 04:49:56,368
SAM: Nuh-uh. I don't think so

6039
04:49:56,368 --> 04:50:01,440
TALIESIN: Only one-- I mean, it's not like you're
saving them by not hitting them at this point

6040
04:50:01,440 --> 04:50:02,678
SAM: They're gonna die.

6041
04:50:02,678 --> 04:50:05,338
TALIESIN: Yeah, no matter what you do.

6042
04:50:05,338 --> 04:50:06,550
MARISHA: Don't kill the kraken.

6043
04:50:06,550 --> 04:50:07,703
TALIESIN: Kraken ain't dying.

6044
04:50:07,703 --> 04:50:10,868
SAM: I mean--

6045
04:50:10,868 --> 04:50:12,082
TALIESIN: Kraken got ten thousand hit points.

6046
04:50:12,082 --> 04:50:12,910
SAM: Wow.

6047
04:50:12,910 --> 04:50:14,313
TALIESIN: He's not even vaguely dying.

6048
04:50:14,313 --> 04:50:18,524
SAM: Is there a part of the kraken I can see that
looks like I can

6049
04:50:18,524 --> 04:50:24,010
do damage to it without hurting the main-- 
what is that, the thorax? (laughs)

6050
04:50:24,010 --> 04:50:29,036
MATT: You don't see any-- it is a big creature.
Your friends are somewhere deep inside its fleshy,

6051
04:50:29,036 --> 04:50:34,090
digesting interior, the outside is armored, and
filled with very, very taut muscle and hide, so

6052
04:50:34,090 --> 04:50:36,319
yeah. You would probably not damage your friends
if you were careful.

6053
04:50:36,319 --> 04:50:41,200
SAM: All right, well, then I will take off a
diamond and blast it with a Prismatic Spray.

6054
04:50:41,200 --> 04:50:41,929
LAURA: (gasps)

6055
04:50:41,929 --> 04:50:42,741
MATT: Oh shit.

6056
04:50:42,741 --> 04:50:43,279
TALIESIN: Thank god!

6057
04:50:43,279 --> 04:50:45,299
SAM: Yeah, yeah, except half of the things won't
do anything to it.

6058
04:50:45,299 --> 04:50:46,486
TALIESIN: Yeah, but we are out of options!

6059
04:50:46,486 --> 04:50:47,944
LAURA: Well, still better than nothing.

6060
04:50:47,944 --> 04:50:53,213
TALIESIN: I am totally okay with a Hail Mary.

6061
04:50:53,213 --> 04:50:54,558
LAURA: Oh my god.

6062
04:50:54,558 --> 04:51:00,514
MATT: Okay, so as a Prismatic Spray, in this
direction-- out this way, it'll just crest past

6063
04:51:00,514 --> 04:51:09,299
the front of the kraken and the tentacles-- let's
see here.

6064
04:51:09,299 --> 04:51:12,205
Prismatic Spray, that's a dexterity saving
throw on that.

6065
04:51:12,205 --> 04:51:13,343
SAM: I'm sure it makes it.

6066
04:51:13,343 --> 04:51:17,244
MATT: That is a 23.

6067
04:51:17,244 --> 04:51:19,141
SAM: Yeah, of course it makes it.

6068
04:51:19,141 --> 04:51:21,900
MATT: All right, so roll for your first beam,
which is against the kraken itself.

6069
04:51:22,284 --> 04:51:26,318
SAM: Do I roll a d8? Or wait, to choose what kind
of beam?

6070
04:51:26,318 --> 04:51:29,830
MATT: Are you focusing on the kraken or one of its
tentacles?

6071
04:51:29,830 --> 04:51:34,926
SAM: I mean, no tentacles are holding anything
right now, right?

6072
04:51:34,926 --> 04:51:35,934
MATT: Currently, no.

6073
04:51:35,934 --> 04:51:36,789
SAM: All right, so--

6074
04:51:36,789 --> 04:51:37,646
MATT: So it'd be just the kraken.

6075
04:51:37,646 --> 04:51:38,604
SAM: Just the kraken.

6076
04:51:38,604 --> 04:51:42,856
MATT: All right, so roll a d8 to see which beam
hits it.

6077
04:51:42,856 --> 04:51:43,952
SAM: Five?

6078
04:51:43,952 --> 04:51:48,013
MATT: Five, that is 10d6 cold damage.

6079
04:51:48,013 --> 04:51:49,223
SAM: Oh, cold! That's good.

6080
04:51:49,223 --> 04:51:50,242
MATT: So go ahead and roll that.

6081
04:51:50,242 --> 04:51:51,397
TALIESIN: Want some d6s? Or are you okay?

6082
04:51:51,397 --> 04:51:52,941
SAM: Doesn't have resistance to that, right?

6083
04:51:52,941 --> 04:51:56,391
LAURA: Maybe.

6084
04:51:56,391 --> 04:51:57,260
SAM: Ten, right?

6085
04:51:57,260 --> 04:51:58,384
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Yeah.

6086
04:51:58,384 --> 04:52:09,560
SAM: Eight, 14, 19, 30, 35.

6087
04:52:09,560 --> 04:52:12,316
MATT: 35 points of cold damage, reduced to half
because it made its save.

6088
04:52:12,316 --> 04:52:13,272
SAM: (groans)

6089
04:52:13,272 --> 04:52:16,508
TRAVIS: Disable those tentacles, man.

6090
04:52:16,508 --> 04:52:17,926
MATT: That's 13. All right.

6091
04:52:17,926 --> 04:52:20,366
TALIESIN: If you do enough damage to it, it may
vomit them out.

6092
04:52:20,366 --> 04:52:22,426
TRAVIS: No, we gotta do it from the inside.

6093
04:52:22,426 --> 04:52:24,476
MATT: You get that sense.

6094
04:52:24,476 --> 04:52:25,585
LAURA: (groans)

6095
04:52:25,585 --> 04:52:26,652
MATT: All right.

6096
04:52:26,652 --> 04:52:29,954
TALIESIN: Do you have-- yeah, and the tentacles
don't get a Prismatic Spray of their own?

6097
04:52:29,954 --> 04:52:33,261
MATT: Nah, it's one of those things where it just
damages the creature,

6098
04:52:33,261 --> 04:52:37,255
you have to focus a specific physical attack 
on one tentacle.

6099
04:52:37,255 --> 04:52:38,814
TALIESIN: Oh, man.

6100
04:52:38,814 --> 04:52:41,015
MATT: All right, that brings us to the top of the
round, Vax,

6101
04:52:41,015 --> 04:52:43,502
go ahead and roll a death saving
throw with advantage.

6102
04:52:43,639 --> 04:52:48,154
SAM: I can't do a-- rip off a patch and take a
potion, can I, as a bonus?

6103
04:52:48,154 --> 04:52:49,595
MATT: A regular potion, you mean?

6104
04:52:49,595 --> 04:52:51,665
SAM: It's a patch potion.

6105
04:52:51,665 --> 04:52:52,895
MATT: A patch potion?

6106
04:52:52,895 --> 04:52:54,201
SAM: Yeah.

6107
04:52:54,201 --> 04:52:55,953
LIAM: It's like a nicotine patch.

6108
04:52:55,953 --> 04:52:57,718
LAURA: Would it be like a patch healing spell?

6109
04:52:57,718 --> 04:52:59,254
TALIESIN: A Patch Addams.

6110
04:52:59,254 --> 04:53:01,515
MATT: Using the patch is an action I think,
originally, sorry.

6111
04:53:01,515 --> 04:53:02,763
TRAVIS: Can you chew it?

6112
04:53:02,763 --> 04:53:05,058
SAM: (laughs) I just chew on the patch.

6113
04:53:05,058 --> 04:53:05,586
MATT: So Vax?

6114
04:53:05,586 --> 04:53:06,911
TALIESIN: It's just jerky you've sewn into you.

6115
04:53:06,911 --> 04:53:07,901
LIAM: Good.

6116
04:53:07,901 --> 04:53:08,735
SAM: (laughs)

6117
04:53:08,735 --> 04:53:11,601
MATT: All right, so Keyleth, death saving throw
please.

6118
04:53:11,601 --> 04:53:13,013
TRAVIS: Oh, I forgot she's unconscious, too.

6119
04:53:13,013 --> 04:53:14,933
TALIESIN: (groans)

6120
04:53:14,933 --> 04:53:16,295
MARISHA: Plus my constitution?

6121
04:53:16,295 --> 04:53:17,507
MATT: Nope, just a d20.

6122
04:53:17,507 --> 04:53:18,299
TALIESIN: Nope, straight.

6123
04:53:18,299 --> 04:53:19,818
MATT: What'd you roll?

6124
04:53:19,818 --> 04:53:21,139
MARISHA: Three.

6125
04:53:21,139 --> 04:53:29,533
MATT: All right, so you failed one death saving
throw. Let's see. Then after that, it's--

6126
04:53:29,533 --> 04:53:32,921
SAM: Percy's having a Mai Tai somewhere.

6127
04:53:32,921 --> 04:53:44,409
MATT: All right, Vex, Trinket and Taryon, make
dexterity saving throws please.

6128
04:53:44,409 --> 04:53:45,913
SAM: 11!

6129
04:53:45,913 --> 04:53:48,801
MATT: 11. Six points of lightning damage.

6130
04:53:48,801 --> 04:53:52,524
LAURA: 19 for me.

6131
04:53:52,524 --> 04:53:54,461
MATT: Six points of lightning damage.

6132
04:53:54,461 --> 04:53:56,505
LAURA: And-- fail, like five.

6133
04:53:56,505 --> 04:53:57,760
MATT: Six points of lightning damage for Trinket.

6134
04:53:57,760 --> 04:53:58,455
LAURA: Six?

6135
04:53:58,455 --> 04:53:59,285
MATT: Yeah.

6136
04:53:59,285 --> 04:54:01,601
LAURA: He's unconscious, so he's bamfed to my
necklace.

6137
04:54:01,601 --> 04:54:03,117
MATT: All right, well, yeah.

6138
04:54:03,117 --> 04:54:04,203
LAURA: Is he within a hundred feet?

6139
04:54:04,203 --> 04:54:07,131
MATT: Yeah, yeah he is. Keyleth, you fail another
death saving throw.

6140
04:54:07,131 --> 04:54:08,593
MARISHA: Immediately?

6141
04:54:08,593 --> 04:54:09,251
TALIESIN: Yeah.

6142
04:54:09,251 --> 04:54:11,130
MATT: You took lightning damage.

6143
04:54:11,130 --> 04:54:13,229
LAURA: Oh my god.

6144
04:54:13,229 --> 04:54:14,745
MATT: All righty.

6145
04:54:14,745 --> 04:54:15,669
LAURA: Oh my god.

6146
04:54:15,669 --> 04:54:17,931
SAM: This is not gonna go well, guys. (nervous
laugh) We got nobody else on the field.

6147
04:54:17,931 --> 04:54:22,033
MATT: Vex, it's your turn, you have an unconscious
Keyleth over here.

6148
04:54:22,033 --> 04:54:24,774
LAURA: I'm gonna swim to her and try to cast Cure
Wounds.

6149
04:54:24,774 --> 04:54:28,305
MATT: Okay. Cast it.

6150
04:54:28,305 --> 04:54:46,263
LAURA: Good, I'm casting it at third level. So
that's 3d8. That's cocked. That sucks. Seven, sorry.

6151
04:54:46,263 --> 04:54:48,929
MATT: So that was a total of what?

6152
04:54:48,929 --> 04:54:49,728
LAURA: Seven.

6153
04:54:49,728 --> 04:54:50,528
MATT: Seven.

6154
04:54:50,528 --> 04:54:52,048
SAM: -- points. Hey Keyleth, you're alive!

6155
04:54:52,048 --> 04:54:54,010
MATT: So Keyleth, you are conscious.

6156
04:54:54,010 --> 04:54:54,831
MARISHA: Seven points?

6157
04:54:54,831 --> 04:54:55,979
MATT: You heal seven hit points, you are
conscious.

6158
04:54:55,979 --> 04:54:57,468
MARISHA: (gasps)

6159
04:54:57,468 --> 04:54:58,306
TRAVIS: Back in the game.

6160
04:54:58,306 --> 04:55:01,743
LAURA: Save my brother! (garbled) Save my
brother.

6161
04:55:01,743 --> 04:55:04,615
MARISHA: (garbled) Okay.

6162
04:55:04,615 --> 04:55:11,523
MATT: All right. Ending Vex's turn. Percival--
actually, Vex, you still have movement if you want to.

6163
04:55:11,523 --> 04:55:13,775
LAURA: I'm gonna try to hide.

6164
04:55:13,775 --> 04:55:14,918
MATT: You have nothing to hide behind.

6165
04:55:14,918 --> 04:55:16,254
MARISHA: Get out, get out, get out.

6166
04:55:16,254 --> 04:55:22,769
LAURA: I'm gonna just swim away from-- I'm just
gonna try to swim towards the fucking door, but

6167
04:55:22,769 --> 04:55:25,869
try to keep my distance from kraken while I'm
doing it.

6168
04:55:25,869 --> 04:55:27,988
MATT: It's hard to do that right now, but you have
the door that way, there's a little gap.

6169
04:55:27,988 --> 04:55:30,551
All right, that ends Vex's turn. 
Percival, anything?

6170
04:55:30,551 --> 04:55:38,262
TALIESIN: Yeah.

6171
04:55:38,262 --> 04:55:39,902
SAM: That thing do anything?

6172
04:55:39,902 --> 04:55:41,650
TALIESIN: No, it fires electricity.

6173
04:55:41,650 --> 04:55:42,622
SAM: Oh.

6174
04:55:42,622 --> 04:55:49,288
LAURA: Oh, shark is going to attack one of the
last tentacles, if it can get to it.

6175
04:55:49,288 --> 04:55:52,219
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold my action for--

6176
04:55:52,219 --> 04:55:54,782
MATT: It can just barely get there. Go ahead and
roll an attack.

6177
04:55:54,782 --> 04:55:56,465
TALIESIN: -- for the vague hope of something
useful.

6178
04:55:56,465 --> 04:55:59,676
MATT: Okay. Holding your action to?

6179
04:55:59,676 --> 04:56:05,893
TALIESIN: To attack-- I've already burned it, and
it laughed it off. Just to attack the kraken--

6180
04:56:05,893 --> 04:56:06,823
MATT: Just sword at the ready?

6181
04:56:06,823 --> 04:56:08,024
TALIESIN: If it gets close enough, just sword,
just--

6182
04:56:08,024 --> 04:56:08,958
MATT: Okay.

6183
04:56:08,958 --> 04:56:09,849
LAURA: 28.

6184
04:56:09,849 --> 04:56:15,355
MATT: 28 hits. Roll damage.

6185
04:56:15,355 --> 04:56:15,906
LAURA: 12.

6186
04:56:15,906 --> 04:56:17,674
SAM: That shark is our most effective weapon.

6187
04:56:17,674 --> 04:56:20,031
LAURA: The shark has been pretty great.

6188
04:56:20,031 --> 04:56:21,715
MATT: All righty. That brings us to--

6189
04:56:21,715 --> 04:56:23,366
SAM: What can you turn us into?

6190
04:56:23,366 --> 04:56:25,994
MATT: -- the kraken's turn. Top of the turn, the
acid burns through you even further, Vax.

6191
04:56:25,994 --> 04:56:27,569
You fail another death saving throw.

6192
04:56:27,569 --> 04:56:28,820
LIAM: So that's two?

6193
04:56:28,820 --> 04:56:37,275
MATT: That's two. All right. Top of the kraken's
turn, it's going to-- let's see who's in range, here.

6194
04:56:37,275 --> 04:56:41,123
SAM: (sings with the background music)

6195
04:56:41,123 --> 04:56:43,206
TRAVIS: This is mindblowing.

6196
04:56:43,206 --> 04:56:44,898
LAURA: And it's so late.

6197
04:56:44,898 --> 04:56:46,580
LIAM: Yeah, it's midnight.

6198
04:56:46,580 --> 04:56:50,808
LAURA: And we're just into the wee hours of the
morning, watching ourselves die.

6199
04:56:50,808 --> 04:56:54,089
SAM: Guys, I think this is one of our tightest
games.

6200
04:56:54,089 --> 04:56:59,859
MATT: This is kind of nuts. All right, it's going
to make a tentacle attack at both--

6201
04:56:59,859 --> 04:57:02,704
at the shark, Vex, and Keyleth.

6202
04:57:02,704 --> 04:57:04,515
LAURA: But he only has two tentacles left.

6203
04:57:04,515 --> 04:57:08,646
MATT: That's right, two tentacles. So it's going
to make one at Vex and Keyleth.

6204
04:57:08,646 --> 04:57:11,063
TRAVIS: But the shark is so dangerous.

6205
04:57:11,063 --> 04:57:12,264
LAURA: The shark's been hurting it.

6206
04:57:12,264 --> 04:57:13,812
SAM: The shark is literally the most dangerous
thing we have.

6207
04:57:13,812 --> 04:57:15,913
LAURA: And Keyleth just is barely--

6208
04:57:15,913 --> 04:57:18,933
MATT: You gather this creature is far more
intelligent than you think.

6209
04:57:18,933 --> 04:57:22,241
It's not a natural beast. It's a fairly 
intelligent creature.

6210
04:57:22,241 --> 04:57:24,274
SAM: What if the shark gets the how do you want to
do this?

6211
04:57:24,274 --> 04:57:34,511
MATT: That is a 26 versus you. You take-- well,
the good news is I'm rolling shit damage. That is

6212
04:57:34,511 --> 04:57:42,192
18 points of bludgeoning damage to you, Vex, and
you are grappled by one tentacle. And against

6213
04:57:42,192 --> 04:57:54,060
Keyleth, you are-- it's technically not within
five feet of you. That's a natural one. I was

6214
04:57:54,060 --> 04:57:58,028
like, I'm pretty sure he had advantage because
you're prone, but prone is the creature has

6215
04:57:58,028 --> 04:57:59,968
advantage against any creature that is within five
feet of the creature,

6216
04:57:59,968 --> 04:58:03,860
otherwise it has disadvantage. So yeah.

6217
04:58:03,860 --> 04:58:05,366
LAURA: That's great.

6218
04:58:05,366 --> 04:58:06,133
TALIESIN: Oh, god.

6219
04:58:06,133 --> 04:58:09,290
MARISHA: I'll just go back to doggy paddling.

6220
04:58:09,290 --> 04:58:16,156
MATT: That's one thing that saved you. And that's
gonna be-- just the two attacks, that's all it can

6221
04:58:16,156 --> 04:58:18,841
do this turn. All right. That brings us to Grog,
you're up.

6222
04:58:18,841 --> 04:58:28,037
TRAVIS: Let us whoop the everloving shit out of
the inside of this kraken, Reckless, everything.

6223
04:58:28,037 --> 04:58:31,447
Yeah. Just all three attacks, just hitting it--

6224
04:58:31,447 --> 04:58:33,335
MATT: Great Weaponmaster as well, or not?

6225
04:58:33,335 --> 04:58:36,019
TRAVIS: It's not really a great weapon.

6226
04:58:36,019 --> 04:58:37,885
MATT: Two-handed, versatile means you can hold it
with two hands.

6227
04:58:37,885 --> 04:58:39,197
TRAVIS: Oh yeah?

6228
04:58:39,197 --> 04:58:42,400
MATT: Pretty sure that's how it works. I'll check
real fast.

6229
04:58:42,400 --> 04:58:47,953
TRAVIS: It's just a hammer, it's not like a
greatsword or a greataxe. I thought maybe it was--

6230
04:58:47,953 --> 04:58:49,393
MATT: I'll double-check the wording, just to be
safe.

6231
04:58:49,393 --> 04:58:50,751
TALIESIN: You'll decrease the resale value of
these books with how much

6232
04:58:50,751 --> 04:58:54,854
you've been cracking the spines tonight. 
I'm just saying.

6233
04:58:54,854 --> 04:58:58,231
MATT: Oh, it's a heavy weapon. Not-- so yeah, you
cannot. You were right.

6234
04:58:58,231 --> 04:59:03,038
TRAVIS: I'll make 'em Reckless, though. All
three.

6235
04:59:03,038 --> 04:59:05,290
LAURA: (sings) My honest husband.

6236
04:59:05,290 --> 04:59:06,941
TRAVIS: 29.

6237
04:59:06,941 --> 04:59:09,336
MATT: 29.

6238
04:59:09,336 --> 04:59:10,317
TRAVIS: Hits, right?

6239
04:59:10,317 --> 04:59:12,735
MATT: Just gonna double-check, 'cause the
internet's gonna get angry at me.

6240
04:59:12,735 --> 04:59:14,975
TRAVIS: I'm just gonna roll the damage.

6241
04:59:14,975 --> 04:59:17,354
MATT: 29 hits.

6242
04:59:17,354 --> 04:59:19,468
TRAVIS: First is a 20.

6243
04:59:19,468 --> 04:59:20,545
MATT: 20 points of damage?

6244
04:59:20,545 --> 04:59:25,006
TRAVIS: Second one is a 22.

6245
04:59:25,006 --> 04:59:27,077
MATT: 22, hits.

6246
04:59:27,077 --> 04:59:29,086
TRAVIS: Hits? Okay, good.

6247
04:59:29,086 --> 04:59:31,394
LAURA: Don't.

6248
04:59:31,394 --> 04:59:32,932
TRAVIS: 24 points of damage.

6249
04:59:32,932 --> 04:59:34,057
MATT: 24 points of damage, all righty.

6250
04:59:34,057 --> 04:59:36,458
TRAVIS: Last one is a natural 20.

6251
04:59:36,458 --> 04:59:38,809
(all cheer)

6252
04:59:38,809 --> 04:59:39,548
MATT: Roll damage.

6253
04:59:39,548 --> 04:59:41,749
SAM: Oh my Jesus.

6254
04:59:41,749 --> 04:59:57,965
TRAVIS: That's a ten, that's 44, and that's seven,
so that's 51 points of damage.

6255
04:59:57,965 --> 04:59:59,939
51 points of damage to it.

6256
04:59:59,939 --> 05:00:03,903
MATT: That, in its own attack, is enough to make
its constitution saving throw. Let's see if it--

6257
05:00:03,903 --> 05:00:08,523
That is a four! Plus 15 is 19, is not enough to
make its constitution saving throw.

6258
05:00:08,523 --> 05:00:13,731
It vomits Grog and an unconscious Vax--

6259
05:00:13,731 --> 05:00:14,942
MARISHA: Oh, thank God.

6260
05:00:14,942 --> 05:00:16,847
MATT: -- out in the front.

6261
05:00:16,847 --> 05:00:17,854
MARISHA: Fucking hell.

6262
05:00:17,854 --> 05:00:19,728
TALIESIN: Got to get a healing potion in that guy
stat.

6263
05:00:19,728 --> 05:00:22,853
MATT: Jesus Christ, guys, you're killing me.

6264
05:00:22,853 --> 05:00:23,886
LAURA: (groans)

6265
05:00:23,886 --> 05:00:25,515
TALIESIN: Get it, get it in him.

6266
05:00:25,515 --> 05:00:26,850
MATT: So, Grog, it's you, you still have your
movement.

6267
05:00:26,850 --> 05:00:28,435
TRAVIS: I do have my movement--

6268
05:00:28,435 --> 05:00:29,225
MATT: Yeah.

6269
05:00:29,225 --> 05:00:31,198
MARISHA: Okay.

6270
05:00:31,198 --> 05:00:35,448
TRAVIS: I am going to-- it's such a short shitty
movement--

6271
05:00:35,448 --> 05:00:36,818
LAURA: You better fucking heal him.

6272
05:00:36,818 --> 05:00:39,763
TRAVIS: -- can I just rotate around him towards
the door and stay within.

6273
05:00:39,763 --> 05:00:40,766
MATT: Yeah.

6274
05:00:40,766 --> 05:00:41,983
TRAVIS: As far as I can get.

6275
05:00:41,983 --> 05:00:43,229
MATT: 25, you can get there.

6276
05:00:43,229 --> 05:00:44,032
TRAVIS: Halved, yep.

6277
05:00:44,032 --> 05:00:45,188
TALIESIN: Ah, fuck.

6278
05:00:45,188 --> 05:00:47,462
MATT: All right, ending Grog's turn, Taryon.

6279
05:00:47,462 --> 05:00:51,262
SAM: Ah, wait, is Little Elf Boy alive?

6280
05:00:51,262 --> 05:00:52,027
MATT: No.

6281
05:00:52,027 --> 05:00:53,128
LAURA: No, he's unconscious.

6282
05:00:53,128 --> 05:00:55,560
MATT: He's unconscious with two failed death
saving throws--

6283
05:00:55,560 --> 05:00:56,598
SAM: And Grog just ran away from him?

6284
05:00:56,598 --> 05:00:58,739
MARISHA: But he's out of the kraken, he's out of
the kraken.

6285
05:00:58,739 --> 05:01:00,540
LAURA: Grog can't do anything.

6286
05:01:00,540 --> 05:01:01,483
SAM: Okay.

6287
05:01:01,483 --> 05:01:03,198
TALIESIN: But if you can heal him for a point--

6288
05:01:03,198 --> 05:01:03,893
SAM: Nope.

6289
05:01:03,893 --> 05:01:04,725
TALIESIN: In any way possible--

6290
05:01:04,725 --> 05:01:05,766
SAM: Nope.

6291
05:01:05,766 --> 05:01:06,533
TALIESIN: Okay.

6292
05:01:06,533 --> 05:01:08,756
SAM: Nope (laughs). Can't do it.

6293
05:01:08,756 --> 05:01:10,734
TALIESIN: This is not good, people.

6294
05:01:10,734 --> 05:01:12,891
LIAM: True love's kiss?

6295
05:01:12,891 --> 05:01:14,233
TALIESIN: I am very far away, right now.

6296
05:01:14,233 --> 05:01:15,570
MATT: There you go, Sam.

6297
05:01:15,570 --> 05:01:16,401
SAM: Is it my turn?

6298
05:01:16,401 --> 05:01:18,344
LIAM: I just mean Sam.

6299
05:01:18,344 --> 05:01:20,748
SAM: I mean, that I would love to do.

6300
05:01:20,748 --> 05:01:22,262
LIAM: Again.

6301
05:01:22,262 --> 05:01:40,372
SAM: (nervous noises) Nope, I got nothing.
Prismatic Spray will kill everybody else-- ring of

6302
05:01:40,372 --> 05:01:47,161
the ram's dead-- I can't throw anything that far,
right? He's like 40 feet away from me?

6303
05:01:47,161 --> 05:01:50,416
MATT: Yep, no, you're right over here you're--
what would Taryon do at this moment?

6304
05:01:50,416 --> 05:01:52,046
SAM: 50 feet away? How far am I?

6305
05:01:52,046 --> 05:01:55,150
MATT: You're about 50 feet from him, yeah.

6306
05:01:55,150 --> 05:01:56,341
MARISHA: You have a bag, right?

6307
05:01:56,341 --> 05:01:59,497
SAM: I can't throw something 50 feet underwater,
and I can only move 15 feet.

6308
05:01:59,497 --> 05:02:03,077
MARISHA: But you can swim out-- oh.

6309
05:02:03,077 --> 05:02:04,988
SAM: (laughs) There's very little I can do--

6310
05:02:04,988 --> 05:02:06,099
MARISHA: But you can double your movement.

6311
05:02:06,099 --> 05:02:14,977
SAM: I will say "crossbow" and change my thing, my
rod, into a crossbow--

6312
05:02:14,977 --> 05:02:15,958
MATT: Uh-huh.

6313
05:02:15,958 --> 05:02:18,046
SAM: And nock the poison bolt and shoot it.

6314
05:02:18,046 --> 05:02:18,862
LAURA: (gasps)

6315
05:02:18,862 --> 05:02:20,139
MATT: Sure, I'll say-- all right, so--

6316
05:02:20,139 --> 05:02:21,702
LAURA: Look at that, look at that poison bolt.

6317
05:02:21,702 --> 05:02:23,098
SAM: I'll also move 15 feet--

6318
05:02:23,098 --> 05:02:25,182
MATT: There you go, go ahead and make your attack
with disadvantage.

6319
05:02:25,182 --> 05:02:32,105
SAM: Okay. (mock-sobbing) It was a one.

6320
05:02:32,105 --> 05:02:34,474
(all laugh)

6321
05:02:34,474 --> 05:02:36,397
MATT: You pull it back and fire and it goes
(kerplunk)

6322
05:02:36,397 --> 05:02:41,183
and the bolt just goes and floats up and 
you're like, "Shit".

6323
05:02:41,183 --> 05:02:42,496
TRAVIS: Wow. Wow.

6324
05:02:42,496 --> 05:02:45,293
SAM: But when I moved Matt, I want to move toward
it, not away.

6325
05:02:45,293 --> 05:02:46,294
MATT: Okay, so you'll be--

6326
05:02:46,294 --> 05:02:48,264
TALIESIN: I'm gonna get you a new d20 soon.

6327
05:02:48,264 --> 05:02:53,984
MATT: All right. Ending Tary's turn, Vax, death
saving throw, with advantage.

6328
05:02:53,984 --> 05:02:55,395
LAURA: (gasps)

6329
05:02:55,395 --> 05:02:57,379
MATT: With no Luck left?

6330
05:02:57,379 --> 05:03:03,410
MARISHA: What what what no? No? Nothing? No luck?
Come on.

6331
05:03:03,410 --> 05:03:04,399
TRAVIS: Wow.

6332
05:03:04,399 --> 05:03:05,545
MARISHA: Raven Queen shit? Nothing?

6333
05:03:05,545 --> 05:03:07,498
TRAVIS: Wow. Really?

6334
05:03:07,498 --> 05:03:13,643
MATT: The last bit of air escapes the lungs of
Vax, lifeless on the ground.

6335
05:03:13,643 --> 05:03:17,549
All right. That ends your turn, obviously, 
Keyleth.

6336
05:03:17,549 --> 05:03:19,533
MARISHA: Oh my God.

6337
05:03:19,533 --> 05:03:21,314
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

6338
05:03:21,314 --> 05:03:22,127
SAM: The kraken.

6339
05:03:22,127 --> 05:03:24,086
MARISHA: Who do I see?

6340
05:03:24,086 --> 05:03:31,567
MATT: You're right here on the ground, you see Vax
not moving. You see Vex currently grappled inside

6341
05:03:31,567 --> 05:03:35,107
there, and Grog and everyone rushing in this
direction towards the portal.

6342
05:03:35,107 --> 05:03:44,251
MARISHA: Vex is grappled, Vax is dead, and then
there's me. How close am I to Vex and Vax?

6343
05:03:44,251 --> 05:03:50,308
MATT: You are ten feet from Vax and 15 feet from
Vex, or ten feet from each, actually.

6344
05:03:50,308 --> 05:03:52,530
MARISHA: I'm ten feet from each?

6345
05:03:52,530 --> 05:03:53,405
MATT: Yeah.

6346
05:03:53,405 --> 05:04:04,151
MARISHA: Can I swim with my Alter Self, grab both
of them-- Can I do that? Can I grab both of them?

6347
05:04:04,151 --> 05:04:04,875
MATT: Okay.

6348
05:04:04,875 --> 05:04:05,923
MARISHA: With my swim speed--

6349
05:04:05,923 --> 05:04:06,923
MATT: All right.

6350
05:04:06,923 --> 05:04:08,086
MARISHA: -- Alter Self. Yeah?

6351
05:04:08,086 --> 05:04:09,021
MATT: You can, you can grab--

6352
05:04:09,021 --> 05:04:10,619
MARISHA: In between them.

6353
05:04:10,619 --> 05:04:15,274
MATT: You can grab Vax-- and begin to tug him
toward Vex at half speed so that's five, ten--

6354
05:04:15,274 --> 05:04:17,551
MARISHA: No I've got Alter Self! I've got Alter
Self!

6355
05:04:17,551 --> 05:04:18,224
MATT: Right, but you're--

6356
05:04:18,224 --> 05:04:19,285
LAURA: You're tugging--

6357
05:04:19,285 --> 05:04:20,578
MATT: -- you're dragging him behind you as you
go.

6358
05:04:20,578 --> 05:04:22,794
MARISHA: Come on, man, do I have Vex--

6359
05:04:22,794 --> 05:04:26,670
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30--

6360
05:04:26,670 --> 05:04:27,602
MARISHA: 30.

6361
05:04:27,602 --> 05:04:28,564
MATT: You're like just in the space.

6362
05:04:28,564 --> 05:04:30,127
MARISHA: (gasps)

6363
05:04:30,127 --> 05:04:31,012
MATT: What're you trying to do?

6364
05:04:31,012 --> 05:04:35,058
MARISHA: And I cast, I cast Plane Shift and I get
us out of here--

6365
05:04:35,058 --> 05:04:44,060
MATT: Oh shit! Okay. All right. And with that,
the three of you vanish.

6366
05:04:44,060 --> 05:04:46,586
MARISHA: Sorry, everyone else.

6367
05:04:46,586 --> 05:04:49,223
SAM: The three of you, wait, you, who, and who?

6368
05:04:49,223 --> 05:04:50,249
MATT: The shark vanishes.

6369
05:04:50,249 --> 05:04:52,245
SAM: Oh, the shark.

6370
05:04:52,245 --> 05:04:53,352
TRAVIS: Who just vanished?

6371
05:04:53,352 --> 05:04:54,546
MARISHA: Me, Vex, and Vax--

6372
05:04:54,546 --> 05:04:55,554
TALIESIN: Everyone but you--

6373
05:04:55,554 --> 05:04:56,636
MATT: Plane Shifting where?

6374
05:04:56,636 --> 05:04:59,143
MARISHA: It's you and Taryon left. Get the fuck
out.

6375
05:04:59,143 --> 05:05:00,312
TRAVIS: Where are you going?

6376
05:05:00,312 --> 05:05:02,038
MATT: Plane Shifting where, Keyleth?

6377
05:05:02,038 --> 05:05:03,975
MARISHA: Back to Vesrah.

6378
05:05:03,975 --> 05:05:04,655
MATT: Okay.

6379
05:05:04,655 --> 05:05:06,232
MARISHA: We're out of the portal.

6380
05:05:06,232 --> 05:05:14,871
MATT: All right. They vanish. Grog. All right, so
that finishes Keyleth's turn. Top of the scale

6381
05:05:14,871 --> 05:05:18,321
here, I need both of you guys to make dexterity
saving throws.

6382
05:05:18,321 --> 05:05:20,573
MARISHA: Wait, who? Who?

6383
05:05:20,573 --> 05:05:22,218
MATT: Grog and Taryon.

6384
05:05:22,218 --> 05:05:23,209
TRAVIS: And I have advantage.

6385
05:05:23,209 --> 05:05:24,172
MARISHA: Wait, Grog is dead?

6386
05:05:24,172 --> 05:05:24,888
ALL: No!

6387
05:05:24,888 --> 05:05:25,796
LAURA: Dexterity!

6388
05:05:25,796 --> 05:05:26,522
MATT: Dexterity.

6389
05:05:26,522 --> 05:05:27,555
TALIESIN: Dexterity saving throw.

6390
05:05:27,555 --> 05:05:28,552
SAM: 18.

6391
05:05:28,552 --> 05:05:30,245
MATT: 18, all right, you take eight points of
lightning damage--

6392
05:05:30,245 --> 05:05:31,466
MARISHA: I thought you said death.

6393
05:05:31,466 --> 05:05:32,576
MATT: Grog?

6394
05:05:32,576 --> 05:05:33,592
TRAVIS: 17.

6395
05:05:33,592 --> 05:05:34,749
MATT: That is eight points--

6396
05:05:34,749 --> 05:05:36,004
TRAVIS: With resistance?

6397
05:05:36,004 --> 05:05:37,441
MATT: Yeah, reduced to four.

6398
05:05:37,441 --> 05:05:38,431
TRAVIS: Okay, so just four.

6399
05:05:38,431 --> 05:05:41,996
MATT: All right, Percival.

6400
05:05:41,996 --> 05:05:46,524
MARISHA: Wait, wait, are you grappled?

6401
05:05:46,524 --> 05:05:47,539
SAM: It's fine, you're not there.

6402
05:05:47,539 --> 05:05:48,573
LAURA: Nobody else is grappled right now.

6403
05:05:48,573 --> 05:05:49,561
TALIESIN: You're not there.

6404
05:05:49,561 --> 05:05:50,884
LIAM: You're gone, you're gone. You're chill with
me.

6405
05:05:50,884 --> 05:05:53,910
MARISHA: Nobody else is grappled.

6406
05:05:53,910 --> 05:05:58,789
TALIESIN: I'm-- There is nothing I can do.

6407
05:05:58,789 --> 05:06:04,234
MATT: All right. End of your turn, the last
legendary action to attempt to grab and grapple Grog.

6408
05:06:04,234 --> 05:06:05,299
MARISHA: (groans)

6409
05:06:05,299 --> 05:06:06,547
MATT: With advantage, because you--

6410
05:06:06,547 --> 05:06:07,864
TRAVIS: That's right.

6411
05:06:07,864 --> 05:06:08,966
LIAM: Fuck you, kraken.

6412
05:06:08,966 --> 05:06:10,049
MATT: That is 26.

6413
05:06:10,049 --> 05:06:10,893
TRAVIS: That hits.

6414
05:06:10,893 --> 05:06:11,950
SAM: (exasperated sigh) Fuck.

6415
05:06:11,950 --> 05:06:18,457
MATT: You take nine-- ten points of bludgeoning
damage, being reduced, and you are grappled.

6416
05:06:18,457 --> 05:06:19,736
TRAVIS: To five? Oh, ten is reduced?

6417
05:06:19,736 --> 05:06:20,653
MATT: Yeah.

6418
05:06:20,653 --> 05:06:21,314
TRAVIS: Okay.

6419
05:06:21,314 --> 05:06:22,000
LIAM: Whew!

6420
05:06:22,000 --> 05:06:23,156
TRAVIS: And can I make my Retaliatory?

6421
05:06:23,156 --> 05:06:24,039
MATT: You can.

6422
05:06:24,039 --> 05:06:24,919
SAM: On that tentacle!

6423
05:06:24,919 --> 05:06:29,308
TRAVIS: Reckless. 23.

6424
05:06:29,308 --> 05:06:33,151
MATT: 23 hits, go ahead and roll damage.

6425
05:06:33,151 --> 05:06:35,936
TRAVIS: That is also a 23.

6426
05:06:35,936 --> 05:06:39,968
MATT: 23, that one had taken 13 damage earlier.
That tentacle is destroyed. There is one left.

6427
05:06:39,968 --> 05:06:40,900
TRAVIS: I'm not grappled?

6428
05:06:40,900 --> 05:06:47,877
MATT: You are no longer grappled. There is one
slightly damaged tentacle left. As you do so, the

6429
05:06:47,877 --> 05:06:56,190
voice says, "No. Come, join your end here in the
depths." All right, that ends your Retaliation,

6430
05:06:56,190 --> 05:06:59,881
Percy's, it is now-- Wait, so that was Percy's
turn, right?

6431
05:06:59,881 --> 05:07:01,248
TALIESIN: I already, I just--

6432
05:07:01,248 --> 05:07:02,377
MARISHA: Can't do anything

6433
05:07:02,377 --> 05:07:04,035
TALIESIN: -- there's literally nothing I can do.

6434
05:07:04,035 --> 05:07:04,988
TRAVIS: Yeah, he didn't do anything.

6435
05:07:04,988 --> 05:07:10,351
MATT: Right, okay. It's gonna come forward here,
it's gonna do Lightning Storm against both of you.

6436
05:07:10,351 --> 05:07:14,005
I need both Taryon and Grog to make dexterity
saving throws once more.

6437
05:07:14,005 --> 05:07:17,380
TRAVIS: That's good.

6438
05:07:17,380 --> 05:07:18,831
SAM: 18.

6439
05:07:18,831 --> 05:07:24,401
TRAVIS: 20. No more blessed.

6440
05:07:24,401 --> 05:07:26,147
LIAM: Hashtag no more blessed.

6441
05:07:26,147 --> 05:07:27,053
MATT: All right.

6442
05:07:27,053 --> 05:07:27,910
TRAVIS: Yeah, hashtag no more blessed.

6443
05:07:27,910 --> 05:07:30,075
LAURA: Hashtag so not blessed.

6444
05:07:30,075 --> 05:07:32,507
MATT: That is a really shitty roll. 13 points
lightning damage--

6445
05:07:32,507 --> 05:07:33,349
SAM: Dead.

6446
05:07:33,349 --> 05:07:34,225
MATT: -- 13 points lightning damage.

6447
05:07:34,225 --> 05:07:35,139
LAURA: Unconscious.

6448
05:07:35,139 --> 05:07:36,362
TRAVIS: 20 and resistance for me.

6449
05:07:36,362 --> 05:07:37,224
MATT: Okay.

6450
05:07:37,224 --> 05:07:38,425
TRAVIS: So it was? Sorry.

6451
05:07:38,425 --> 05:07:39,666
MATT: It was 13 minus that to--

6452
05:07:39,666 --> 05:07:40,543
LAURA: Tary--

6453
05:07:40,543 --> 05:07:41,510
MATT: -- seven.

6454
05:07:41,510 --> 05:07:42,406
TRAVIS: Seven.

6455
05:07:42,406 --> 05:07:43,788
MATT: So Taryon falls unconscious.

6456
05:07:43,788 --> 05:07:46,919
LAURA: Motherfuck.

6457
05:07:46,919 --> 05:07:48,694
LIAM: Scanlan appears in a purple puff of smoke!

6458
05:07:48,694 --> 05:07:49,330
MATT: I know.

6459
05:07:49,330 --> 05:07:51,532
TRAVIS: Are you really? Are you really? Where are
you?

6460
05:07:51,532 --> 05:07:52,644
SAM: He's right near you.

6461
05:07:52,644 --> 05:07:59,169
MARISHA: So both Vex and Tary are unconscious?

6462
05:07:59,169 --> 05:08:00,228
MATT: So, Grog, it's your turn.

6463
05:08:00,228 --> 05:08:01,133
SAM: You don't even like me.

6464
05:08:01,133 --> 05:08:01,823
TRAVIS: I'm gonna take the coin--

6465
05:08:01,823 --> 05:08:02,740
MARISHA: You're unconscious?

6466
05:08:02,740 --> 05:08:03,471
LIAM: She's with us.

6467
05:08:03,471 --> 05:08:04,094
LAURA: You took me!

6468
05:08:04,094 --> 05:08:04,790
LIAM: You just bamfed us out.

6469
05:08:04,790 --> 05:08:05,420
TRAVIS: -- I'm gonna Alter Self.

6470
05:08:05,420 --> 05:08:06,392
MARISHA: Wait, who's unconscious?

6471
05:08:06,392 --> 05:08:07,097
MATT: Okay.

6472
05:08:07,097 --> 05:08:07,869
LAURA and LIAM: Tary!

6473
05:08:07,869 --> 05:08:08,487
TRAVIS: I'm gonna grow gills and fins.

6474
05:08:08,487 --> 05:08:09,638
SAM: Wait! Sh! He's doing stuff.

6475
05:08:09,638 --> 05:08:12,302
MATT: Okay. So the gills and fins appear, your
webbed fingers, and what're you doing?

6476
05:08:12,302 --> 05:08:14,792
TRAVIS: I see Tary fall... and I...

6477
05:08:14,792 --> 05:08:16,813
... bolt for the portal.

6478
05:08:16,813 --> 05:08:19,980
LAURA: (gasps)

6479
05:08:19,980 --> 05:08:21,178
SAM: Going right past me.

6480
05:08:21,178 --> 05:08:22,185
TRAVIS: Yep.

6481
05:08:22,185 --> 05:08:23,206
LAURA: Oh, fuck.

6482
05:08:23,206 --> 05:08:24,628
TALIESIN: I am staring you in the deadeye--

6483
05:08:24,628 --> 05:08:29,699
SAM: I love it. I love it.

6484
05:08:29,699 --> 05:08:31,692
TRAVIS: And can I, can I like--

6485
05:08:31,692 --> 05:08:33,048
MARISHA: We need, he has a purse.

6486
05:08:33,048 --> 05:08:34,723
TRAVIS: -- can I like double my speed?

6487
05:08:34,723 --> 05:08:37,837
MATT: No, unfortunately, because you used your
action to do the ability on you, however-- Oh!

6488
05:08:37,837 --> 05:08:39,355
Wait, wait, you have the-- so you have the full
movement--

6489
05:08:39,355 --> 05:08:40,097
TRAVIS: I do.

6490
05:08:40,097 --> 05:08:40,728
SAM: Full movement?

6491
05:08:40,728 --> 05:08:41,733
TRAVIS: That's right, 50.

6492
05:08:41,733 --> 05:08:43,039
TALIESIN: We need the-- (sigh) we need the fucking
lodestone.

6493
05:08:43,039 --> 05:08:43,723
LAURA: Oh he's--

6494
05:08:43,723 --> 05:08:44,651
LAURA &amp; SAM: -- got the other lodestone.

6495
05:08:44,651 --> 05:08:47,011
LAURA: He does have the third lodestone!

6496
05:08:47,011 --> 05:08:48,100
SAM: Fuck you guys.

6497
05:08:48,100 --> 05:08:48,780
TRAVIS: Do I make it to the portal?

6498
05:08:48,780 --> 05:08:52,131
MATT: You are just on the outskirts of it. And
you see Percy yelling at you.

6499
05:08:52,131 --> 05:08:53,885
TALIESIN: Lodestone!

6500
05:08:53,885 --> 05:08:54,565
TRAVIS: What? Oh!

6501
05:08:54,565 --> 05:08:59,454
(all laugh)

6502
05:08:59,454 --> 05:09:00,635
TRAVIS: Right.

6503
05:09:00,635 --> 05:09:03,656
LAURA: Oh, that was a great way to ensure that you
got out of here, Tary.

6504
05:09:03,656 --> 05:09:06,782
(all laugh)

6505
05:09:06,782 --> 05:09:15,723
MATT: All right, coming through at 20, Grog, I
need you to make a dexterity saving throw.

6506
05:09:15,723 --> 05:09:19,254
LIAM: Come on, girl. Get out.

6507
05:09:19,254 --> 05:09:21,425
TRAVIS: 19.

6508
05:09:21,425 --> 05:09:26,371
MATT: That is 10 reduced to five, five points of
lightning damage against you.

6509
05:09:26,371 --> 05:09:28,313
Taryon, you fail a death saving throw--

6510
05:09:28,313 --> 05:09:29,107
SAM: Sure.

6511
05:09:29,107 --> 05:09:30,710
MATT: -- automatically 'cause you take the damage
from the lightning.

6512
05:09:30,710 --> 05:09:32,413
TALIESIN: How far is Tary from the-- how many feet
is Tary from the portal?

6513
05:09:32,413 --> 05:09:34,537
MATT: Tary is--

6514
05:09:34,537 --> 05:09:35,417
SAM: 50?

6515
05:09:35,417 --> 05:09:36,351
MATT: 40 feet.

6516
05:09:36,351 --> 05:09:38,345
TALIESIN: 40 feet?

6517
05:09:38,345 --> 05:09:39,810
MATT: Yep.

6518
05:09:39,810 --> 05:09:42,057
TALIESIN: What's my running speed?

6519
05:09:42,057 --> 05:09:42,889
MARISHA: Get out, get out.

6520
05:09:42,889 --> 05:09:44,372
TALIESIN: What's my running speed?

6521
05:09:44,372 --> 05:09:45,237
MATT: Your running speed is 30.

6522
05:09:45,237 --> 05:09:46,504
TALIESIN: Okay.

6523
05:09:46,504 --> 05:09:47,937
MATT: All right, Percival, what're you doing?

6524
05:09:47,937 --> 05:09:51,142
MARISHA: Get out, get out, get out.

6525
05:09:51,142 --> 05:09:52,929
SAM: You can dash and get 60.

6526
05:09:52,929 --> 05:09:56,730
TALIESIN: (deep sigh) God damn it.

6527
05:09:56,730 --> 05:09:57,943
MARISHA: You still have the coin, right?

6528
05:09:57,943 --> 05:09:58,792
TALIESIN: I've already taken it.

6529
05:09:58,792 --> 05:10:00,561
SAM: Your potion of haste.

6530
05:10:00,561 --> 05:10:01,631
TRAVIS: Don't complicate this.

6531
05:10:01,631 --> 05:10:02,686
TALIESIN: I don't have a potion of haste!

6532
05:10:02,686 --> 05:10:03,563
SAM: Yeah, sure you do.

6533
05:10:03,563 --> 05:10:06,862
TRAVIS: Don't complicate this, I think we'll be
okay. I think.

6534
05:10:06,862 --> 05:10:07,913
MATT: Percival, what are you doing?

6535
05:10:07,913 --> 05:10:13,134
TALIESIN: I have a healing potion. I have a
healing potion.

6536
05:10:13,134 --> 05:10:15,086
MATT: All right.

6537
05:10:15,086 --> 05:10:16,740
TALIESIN: Fuck.

6538
05:10:16,740 --> 05:10:18,580
MARISHA: Come on, Percy.

6539
05:10:18,580 --> 05:10:22,269
TALIESIN: I don't know what the fuck to do.

6540
05:10:22,269 --> 05:10:25,150
LIAM: That's the title for the episode.

6541
05:10:25,150 --> 05:10:26,853
SAM: What's your speed?

6542
05:10:26,853 --> 05:10:27,839
TALIESIN: 60.

6543
05:10:27,839 --> 05:10:30,044
SAM: Yeah, so go over there and heal me, fucker!

6544
05:10:30,044 --> 05:10:32,928
(all laugh)

6545
05:10:32,928 --> 05:10:36,238
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm not going to survive one round
in there. I'm 16 points.

6546
05:10:36,238 --> 05:10:38,582
SAM: Oh, okay, I will.

6547
05:10:38,582 --> 05:10:44,064
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's no-- is Grog looking
rough?

6548
05:10:44,064 --> 05:10:45,863
MATT: Grog, how are you looking?

6549
05:10:45,863 --> 05:10:46,663
TRAVIS: I'm okay.

6550
05:10:46,663 --> 05:10:48,049
TALIESIN: You're looking fine?

6551
05:10:48,049 --> 05:10:48,891
TRAVIS: I'm all right.

6552
05:10:48,891 --> 05:10:54,441
TALIESIN: I'm just going to scowl at you. I'm
actually, fuck it! I have something I can do!

6553
05:10:54,441 --> 05:10:55,130
MATT: What are you doing?

6554
05:10:55,130 --> 05:10:56,091
SAM: Science bros, man!

6555
05:10:56,091 --> 05:10:58,856
MATT: What are you doing, Percy?

6556
05:10:58,856 --> 05:11:02,305
TALIESIN: I'm gonna cast Friends on Grog.

6557
05:11:02,305 --> 05:11:06,299
MATT: Grog. Make a wisdom saving throw. With
advantage, because of Heroes' Feast.

6558
05:11:06,299 --> 05:11:08,188
TRAVIS: I don't even know what that is.

6559
05:11:08,188 --> 05:11:09,256
LIAM: Wow.

6560
05:11:09,256 --> 05:11:14,266
TRAVIS: Three. Five. Zero modifier.

6561
05:11:14,266 --> 05:11:15,403
LIAM: Holy shit.

6562
05:11:15,403 --> 05:11:16,673
TRAVIS: I don't know what that is.

6563
05:11:16,673 --> 05:11:18,960
LIAM: Love this game.

6564
05:11:18,960 --> 05:11:22,712
MATT: Actually, it's supposed to be charisma
checks against him. What are you trying to do?

6565
05:11:22,712 --> 05:11:24,910
TALIESIN: Just toss the nitwit through the door!

6566
05:11:24,910 --> 05:11:26,564
MATT: Wait, are you trying to intimidate him?

6567
05:11:26,564 --> 05:11:27,914
TALIESIN: No, I'm begging!

6568
05:11:27,914 --> 05:11:29,747
MATT: All right. Make a persuasion check with
advantage.

6569
05:11:29,747 --> 05:11:30,990
That's how technically it's supposed to work.

6570
05:11:30,990 --> 05:11:31,950
TALIESIN: Yes.

6571
05:11:31,950 --> 05:11:33,363
MATT: But, I'm giving you--

6572
05:11:33,363 --> 05:11:34,550
TRAVIS: Through the water?

6573
05:11:34,550 --> 05:11:39,089
TALIESIN: With advantage, that was cocked, though,
was it?

6574
05:11:39,089 --> 05:11:40,175
SAM: That's a 20.

6575
05:11:40,175 --> 05:11:43,335
TALIESIN: Okay. Yeah, it was 20.

6576
05:11:43,335 --> 05:11:44,296
MATT: 20? Okay.

6577
05:11:44,296 --> 05:11:45,286
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

6578
05:11:45,286 --> 05:11:47,997
MATT: Okay, Grog. You come through and see Percy
looking at you, and oh shit,

6579
05:11:47,997 --> 05:11:52,443
you don't wanna make him mad. He's your buddy.

6580
05:11:52,443 --> 05:11:53,997
TALIESIN: Toss the nitwit through the door.

6581
05:11:53,997 --> 05:11:57,371
TRAVIS: The nitwit. That's-- okay.

6582
05:11:57,371 --> 05:12:01,663
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm good. I'm good.

6583
05:12:01,663 --> 05:12:02,898
MATT: Okay.

6584
05:12:02,898 --> 05:12:05,302
TALIESIN: I love you. I'm so proud of you.

6585
05:12:05,302 --> 05:12:06,106
LAURA: What just happened?

6586
05:12:06,106 --> 05:12:06,908
TRAVIS: The nitwit.

6587
05:12:06,908 --> 05:12:08,267
TALIESIN: That's what I said.

6588
05:12:08,267 --> 05:12:10,299
TRAVIS: Who do you think I'd think the nitwit is?

6589
05:12:10,299 --> 05:12:11,132
TALIESIN: I think it's--

6590
05:12:11,132 --> 05:12:14,026
MARISHA: Grog.

6591
05:12:14,026 --> 05:12:21,120
TALIESIN: I can't take it back, what I said. I'm
well aware.

6592
05:12:21,120 --> 05:12:22,652
MATT: All right.

6593
05:12:22,652 --> 05:12:26,156
SAM: (sings along with the background music)

6594
05:12:26,156 --> 05:12:29,298
TALIESIN: I can start to argue with you if you
start to do something stupid, which is fine.

6595
05:12:29,298 --> 05:12:32,884
TRAVIS: You did cast Friends, so. Technically, I
would think nitwit is me,

6596
05:12:32,884 --> 05:12:34,883
and I'd be like, okay, here I go.

6597
05:12:34,883 --> 05:12:36,366
TALIESIN: You might. I'm not gonna--

6598
05:12:36,366 --> 05:12:38,777
SAM: Why don't you roll for it, Travis?

6599
05:12:38,777 --> 05:12:42,224
TRAVIS: No, he cast Friends, and the whole point
is to-- yeah.

6600
05:12:42,224 --> 05:12:45,669
LIAM: You don't know that.

6601
05:12:45,669 --> 05:12:47,441
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's a DM call. It's not quite my
call.

6602
05:12:47,441 --> 05:12:48,608
MATT: The kraken is going to go ahead and make a
bite attack against you.

6603
05:12:48,608 --> 05:12:49,542
TALIESIN: Ah, god damn it.

6604
05:12:49,542 --> 05:12:52,030
MATT: Because it only has the one tentacle left.
That is an 18 plus six,

6605
05:12:52,030 --> 05:12:54,948
that is 24. That hits you. You take--

6606
05:12:54,948 --> 05:13:02,558
TALIESIN: Oh, shit.

6607
05:13:02,558 --> 05:13:05,621
MATT: That's 23 points of piercing damage.

6608
05:13:05,621 --> 05:13:06,403
TRAVIS: How many?

6609
05:13:06,403 --> 05:13:14,371
MATT: 23. Reduced to 12 because of your raging.
And you are-- oh, you were not grappled by the

6610
05:13:14,371 --> 05:13:16,446
kraken. So it does not swallow you.

6611
05:13:16,446 --> 05:13:17,914
(all cheer)

6612
05:13:17,914 --> 05:13:25,095
MATT: That saves your ass there, man. I was just
about to eat you. Okay. Been good for you guys.

6613
05:13:25,095 --> 05:13:30,361
Yeah, that's the kraken's turn. Grog, what are you
doing?

6614
05:13:30,361 --> 05:13:35,521
TRAVIS: I am going to aquaman run over to Tary.

6615
05:13:35,521 --> 05:13:38,029
TALIESIN: You have full speed now.

6616
05:13:38,029 --> 05:13:38,691
TRAVIS: Yep.

6617
05:13:38,691 --> 05:13:40,505
TALIESIN: So you can double-speed if you want.

6618
05:13:40,505 --> 05:13:45,902
MATT: Well, it's 25 there. It's gonna take an
action to pick him up.

6619
05:13:45,902 --> 05:13:48,100
TRAVIS: Maybe I just wanna grab the bag.

6620
05:13:48,100 --> 05:13:50,063
LAURA: He said nitwit, throw the nitwit through
the door.

6621
05:13:50,063 --> 05:13:50,971
MATT: What do you want to do, Grog? It's your
call.

6622
05:13:50,971 --> 05:13:52,408
TALIESIN: I'm not gonna fight you no matter what.

6623
05:13:52,408 --> 05:13:53,414
MATT: Yeah, what do you wanna do, Grog?

6624
05:13:53,414 --> 05:13:56,498
TRAVIS: He cast Friends, right? So I wouldn't want
to make Percy mad.

6625
05:13:56,498 --> 05:13:59,271
MATT: Well, it's up to you. Friends affects him
more than it affects you, technically.

6626
05:13:59,271 --> 05:14:01,739
He just seems very persuasive.

6627
05:14:01,739 --> 05:14:03,346
TALIESIN: You feel like I had a point.

6628
05:14:03,346 --> 05:14:05,028
TRAVIS: I pick up Tary.

6629
05:14:05,028 --> 05:14:14,314
MATT: Okay. Moving back with him, because your
strength doesn't reduce your movement. (counts)

6630
05:14:14,314 --> 05:14:19,293
25. You don't quite reach the edge.

6631
05:14:19,293 --> 05:14:23,235
LAURA: Can he throw Tary through? Or is that an
additional action?

6632
05:14:23,235 --> 05:14:24,985
TRAVIS: Do I have anything to toss him through
that thing?

6633
05:14:24,985 --> 05:14:29,476
MATT: No, it takes your whole-- to pick him up and
get there, you only have your bonus action right now.

6634
05:14:29,476 --> 05:14:34,550
TRAVIS: Can I take one of the tiny little healing
potions, the regular-ass ones?

6635
05:14:34,550 --> 05:14:35,537
MATT: If you have one, yeah.

6636
05:14:35,537 --> 05:14:37,000
TRAVIS: I have one.

6637
05:14:37,000 --> 05:14:38,471
MATT: So there you go. You take it.

6638
05:14:38,471 --> 05:14:39,886
TRAVIS: I forget what it's called.

6639
05:14:39,886 --> 05:14:41,367
LIAM: Red Bull.

6640
05:14:41,367 --> 05:14:42,660
MATT: It's 2d4 plus two.

6641
05:14:42,660 --> 05:14:43,390
LAURA: It's a Red Bull.

6642
05:14:43,390 --> 05:14:44,387
TRAVIS: 2d4 plus two?

6643
05:14:44,387 --> 05:14:50,364
MATT: 2d4 plus two. Ends Grog's turn. Taryon. Make
a death saving throw.

6644
05:14:50,364 --> 05:14:51,161
SAM: 11?

6645
05:14:51,161 --> 05:14:52,302
MATT: 11. So you're fine.

6646
05:14:52,302 --> 05:14:55,364
TALIESIN: That's one good one. You get a success.

6647
05:14:55,364 --> 05:14:57,582
MATT: That brings us up to the top.

6648
05:14:57,582 --> 05:14:58,919
TALIESIN: Is it mine?

6649
05:14:58,919 --> 05:14:59,779
MATT: Not quite yet.

6650
05:14:59,779 --> 05:15:00,764
TALIESIN: Fuck.

6651
05:15:00,764 --> 05:15:01,878
MATT: We are at the 20.

6652
05:15:01,878 --> 05:15:03,404
LAURA: Lair actions.

6653
05:15:03,404 --> 05:15:04,511
TALIESIN: God damn it.

6654
05:15:04,511 --> 05:15:12,635
MATT: All right. That's a dexterity saving throw
from you, Grog. It's just all-out shocking.

6655
05:15:12,635 --> 05:15:14,014
TRAVIS: 16.

6656
05:15:14,014 --> 05:15:16,098
MATT: 16. That is 14 points of lightning damage to
you, Grog.

6657
05:15:16,098 --> 05:15:17,011
TRAVIS: Halved to seven.

6658
05:15:17,011 --> 05:15:18,255
MATT: Yep, halved to seven.

6659
05:15:18,255 --> 05:15:19,576
SAM: Automatic death fail.

6660
05:15:19,576 --> 05:15:24,047
MATT: Automatic death fail. All right, that
brings us now to Percival.

6661
05:15:24,047 --> 05:15:26,667
TALIESIN: I am just going to lean out the fucking
door and

6662
05:15:26,667 --> 05:15:30,716
take three attacks at a tentacle and run back in.

6663
05:15:30,716 --> 05:15:32,599
MATT: Okay.

6664
05:15:32,599 --> 05:15:34,067
TALIESIN: Since he's right there!

6665
05:15:34,067 --> 05:15:37,275
MATT: Well, currently there is no tentacle in your
range.

6666
05:15:37,275 --> 05:15:38,427
TALIESIN: There's no tentacle in the range?

6667
05:15:38,427 --> 05:15:41,351
MATT: Right now, the tentacle's in range when it's
wrapped around somebody, you can hit it right

6668
05:15:41,351 --> 05:15:43,335
there. Right now, it's just in the distance.

6669
05:15:43,335 --> 05:15:49,323
TALIESIN: In that case, I'm going to run out, grab
and help drag everybody through the portal if I can.

6670
05:15:49,323 --> 05:15:52,772
MATT: You can grab and pull Taryon.

6671
05:15:52,772 --> 05:15:53,899
TALIESIN: Be cool.

6672
05:15:53,899 --> 05:15:55,262
TRAVIS: Pssh. We'll see--

6673
05:15:55,262 --> 05:15:56,244
TALIESIN: You're going to be fine.

6674
05:15:56,244 --> 05:15:57,480
TRAVIS: --Friend.

6675
05:15:57,480 --> 05:15:59,375
TALIESIN: You won't know for a while.

6676
05:15:59,375 --> 05:16:00,557
TRAVIS: We'll find out.

6677
05:16:00,557 --> 05:16:05,555
MATT: You pull Taryon through, his unconscious
body through.

6678
05:16:05,555 --> 05:16:07,213
TALIESIN: And I'm-- healing potion. I've got a
minor.

6679
05:16:07,213 --> 05:16:08,161
MATT: You have a healing potion?

6680
05:16:08,161 --> 05:16:10,381
TALIESIN: I do. I've got a minor left that I
haven't burned.

6681
05:16:10,381 --> 05:16:15,151
MATT: Okay. So, I'll say that between your
movement, you'll have enough.

6682
05:16:15,151 --> 05:16:17,242
Go ahead and 2d4 plus two to Taryon.

6683
05:16:17,242 --> 05:16:18,375
TALIESIN: 2d4 plus what?

6684
05:16:18,375 --> 05:16:19,916
MATT: 2d4 plus two to Taryon.

6685
05:16:19,916 --> 05:16:21,904
TALIESIN: So that's six.

6686
05:16:21,904 --> 05:16:24,867
MATT: Taryon is conscious.

6687
05:16:24,867 --> 05:16:30,528
TALIESIN: Now, I'm standing at the portal ready
to, yeah.

6688
05:16:30,528 --> 05:16:33,021
MATT: All right. It is now the kraken's turn.

6689
05:16:33,021 --> 05:16:34,353
LAURA: Oh my god.

6690
05:16:34,353 --> 05:16:35,787
TALIESIN: He got nothing.

6691
05:16:35,787 --> 05:16:41,432
MATT: The kraken is going to sit right here now,
directly behind you, Grog. Its tentacles swarm.

6692
05:16:41,432 --> 05:16:45,407
It's the one tentacle, all these broken tentacles
that are trying to extend. You can see parts of it

6693
05:16:45,407 --> 05:16:49,570
are regenerating and starting to extend a little
bit. Not fully, but it's going to take a while for

6694
05:16:49,570 --> 05:16:52,667
it-- but you can see it does regenerate
over time.

6695
05:16:52,777 --> 05:16:57,330
TRAVIS: That is a bad, bad creature.

6696
05:16:57,330 --> 05:17:00,781
MATT: You know what, at the end of Percival's
turn, it's going to use one of its legendary actions.

6697
05:17:00,781 --> 05:17:02,158
TALIESIN: God damn it!

6698
05:17:02,158 --> 05:17:05,867
MATT: To attempt to bash.

6699
05:17:05,867 --> 05:17:07,404
TRAVIS: I don't know what that means.

6700
05:17:07,404 --> 05:17:08,438
MATT: Natural 20.

6701
05:17:08,438 --> 05:17:12,501
LAURA: Oh my god.

6702
05:17:12,501 --> 05:17:19,967
MATT: So that is 17 points of bludgeoning damage
against you, reduced to half.

6703
05:17:19,967 --> 05:17:21,411
TRAVIS: To eight? Nine?

6704
05:17:21,411 --> 05:17:25,465
MATT: That would be nine, yeah. And, you are
grappled.

6705
05:17:25,465 --> 05:17:28,765
MARISHA: He's grappled?

6706
05:17:28,765 --> 05:17:30,764
MATT: Now it's the kraken's turn.

6707
05:17:30,764 --> 05:17:32,202
LAURA: I think it's going to try to swallow him.

6708
05:17:32,202 --> 05:17:42,396
MATT: And it is going to attempt to bite attack
you. It does not have advantage. That is a 20?

6709
05:17:42,396 --> 05:17:44,345
TRAVIS: That hits.

6710
05:17:44,345 --> 05:17:46,376
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it!

6711
05:17:46,376 --> 05:17:56,411
MATT: That is 18 points of piercing damage,
reduced to nine.

6712
05:17:56,411 --> 05:17:57,440
TRAVIS: Mm-hm.

6713
05:17:57,440 --> 05:17:58,456
MATT: And you are swallowed.

6714
05:17:58,456 --> 05:18:00,370
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it. Okay.

6715
05:18:00,370 --> 05:18:07,175
SAM: So you get any attacks, Groggy? Mm-hm?
Okay.

6716
05:18:07,175 --> 05:18:09,528
MATT: All righty. Grog, it's your turn.

6717
05:18:09,528 --> 05:18:10,725
TRAVIS: All three attacks--

6718
05:18:10,725 --> 05:18:11,528
MATT: Go for it.

6719
05:18:11,528 --> 05:18:17,285
TRAVIS: -- Reckless. That's a 32.

6720
05:18:17,285 --> 05:18:18,520
TALIESIN: Things!

6721
05:18:18,520 --> 05:18:20,095
SAM: I can heal you!

6722
05:18:20,095 --> 05:18:22,413
TRAVIS: It's 20 points of damage on the first
one.

6723
05:18:22,442 --> 05:18:25,209
MATT: All right, 20.

6724
05:18:25,209 --> 05:18:27,403
TRAVIS: 26 is the hit for the second one.

6725
05:18:27,403 --> 05:18:30,460
MATT: That hits.

6726
05:18:30,460 --> 05:18:32,438
TRAVIS: 24 points of damage on the second one.

6727
05:18:32,438 --> 05:18:35,599
MATT: 24, all right.

6728
05:18:35,599 --> 05:18:37,101
TRAVIS: And then 23.

6729
05:18:37,101 --> 05:18:39,825
MATT: That hits.

6730
05:18:39,825 --> 05:18:43,595
TRAVIS: With 19 points of damage on the third
one.

6731
05:18:43,595 --> 05:18:45,627
MATT: It has to make a constitution save.

6732
05:18:45,627 --> 05:18:51,596
That is directly a nine plus 15. 
It's a 24; the DC is 25.

6733
05:18:51,596 --> 05:18:55,051
It fails, and vomits you out again to the front of
it!

6734
05:18:55,051 --> 05:18:56,831
Jesus Christ!

6735
05:18:56,831 --> 05:18:58,244
LAURA: Right through the door! Vomits him right
through the door!

6736
05:18:58,244 --> 05:19:00,447
MARISHA: Come on, through the door! He projectile
vomits!

6737
05:19:00,447 --> 05:19:04,243
MATT: I'm going to take a picture of that so
people--

6738
05:19:04,243 --> 05:19:05,149
MARISHA: Come on!

6739
05:19:05,149 --> 05:19:06,825
MATT: -- are like, "That's a little too close."

6740
05:19:06,825 --> 05:19:12,928
TRAVIS: With the rest of my movement, can I turn
around and look at him and go, yo, O Ancient One,

6741
05:19:12,928 --> 05:19:23,150
can you read my mind now? And I walk through the
portal.

6742
05:19:23,150 --> 05:19:29,263
MATT: And you do as you step away through the
portal. (laughs) I can't believe that shit!

6743
05:19:29,263 --> 05:19:30,515
TRAVIS: Just double birds.

6744
05:19:30,515 --> 05:19:33,994
MATT: I just tweeted that final saving throw on
his end. Wow!

6745
05:19:33,994 --> 05:19:41,268
TALIESIN: I hand you my glasses and fall down.

6746
05:19:41,268 --> 05:19:46,013
MATT: And that's where we're going to end
tonight's game. Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!

6747
05:19:46,013 --> 05:19:47,920
SAM: That was terrible!

6748
05:19:47,920 --> 05:19:52,132
MATT: Don't fuck with the titan creatures, man!
Hey, your first death, Vax!

6749
05:19:52,132 --> 05:19:53,555
TRAVIS: Titan creatures? Titan creatures.

6750
05:19:53,555 --> 05:19:55,814
SAM: First death? He's dead! That's not good!

6751
05:19:55,814 --> 05:19:57,682
MARISHA: He's still fucking dead!

6752
05:19:57,682 --> 05:19:58,518
MATT: Yep.

6753
05:19:58,518 --> 05:20:00,098
MARISHA: He's still fucking dead.

6754
05:20:00,098 --> 05:20:01,312
LIAM: May be my last death.

6755
05:20:01,312 --> 05:20:02,133
MARISHA: God!

6756
05:20:02,133 --> 05:20:03,168
TRAVIS: We don't know. We don't know.

6757
05:20:03,168 --> 05:20:04,317
TALIESIN: I think he should just--

6758
05:20:04,317 --> 05:20:07,758
MATT: And if so, that's at the bailiwick of your
Queen. But we'll find out where that brings us

6759
05:20:07,758 --> 05:20:11,544
next week. One way or another, a climactic end to
the Aramente.

6760
05:20:11,544 --> 05:20:13,300
LAURA: Oh my god.

6761
05:20:13,300 --> 05:20:14,786
MARISHA: And all of the guilt complexes.

6762
05:20:14,786 --> 05:20:17,352
TRAVIS: Wow. I underestimated that whole thing.

6763
05:20:17,352 --> 05:20:21,587
LAURA: That was so much worse than I ever thought
it would be.

6764
05:20:21,587 --> 05:20:23,225
TALIESIN: I don't feel good.

6765
05:20:23,225 --> 05:20:25,047
LAURA: I feel like I'm going to throw up.

6766
05:20:25,047 --> 05:20:27,389
TALIESIN: Yeah, I feel a little nauseous, and it's
not just the kraken.

6767
05:20:27,389 --> 05:20:28,473
TRAVIS: Thank you, Loot Crate!

6768
05:20:28,473 --> 05:20:31,318
MATT: Thank you, Loot Crate, for being our
sponsor!

6769
05:20:31,318 --> 05:20:36,955
TALIESIN: Thanks, Loot Crate, for the robot and
the Legos.

6770
05:20:36,955 --> 05:20:40,912
MARISHA: Who's still alive? All of us, but Vax and
Taryon?

6771
05:20:40,912 --> 05:20:42,138
LAURA: Everybody but Vax.

6772
05:20:42,138 --> 05:20:44,364
MATT: How many points did you have at the end
there, Grog?

6773
05:20:44,364 --> 05:20:45,493
TRAVIS: Eight.

6774
05:20:45,493 --> 05:20:47,363
MATT: Eight hit points?!

6775
05:20:47,363 --> 05:20:48,276
TRAVIS: Eight hit points.

6776
05:20:48,276 --> 05:20:49,848
MATT: Holy fucking shit!

6777
05:20:49,848 --> 05:20:52,135
LAURA: Yeah! I was watching him take it down, and
I was like,

6778
05:20:52,135 --> 05:20:54,041
oh my god, one more hit and Grog's unconscious!

6779
05:20:54,041 --> 05:20:59,597
TRAVIS: 65, 61, 51, 44, 39, 27, 33, 26, 17,
eight.

6780
05:20:59,597 --> 05:21:01,338
LIAM: Wow. Wow!

6781
05:21:01,338 --> 05:21:07,075
TRAVIS: If I didn't get barfed, we would have
problems.

6782
05:21:07,075 --> 05:21:11,671
TALIESIN: I was going to make a running, yeah. I
was not willing to, yeah. I was not going to walk.

6783
05:21:11,671 --> 05:21:13,476
LAURA: You would have been swallowed, too.

6784
05:21:13,476 --> 05:21:16,800
TALIESIN: I had a thought, but it was a bad
thought.

6785
05:21:16,800 --> 05:21:18,965
I'm really glad I didn't have to go with that 
bad thought.

6786
05:21:18,965 --> 05:21:20,723
LAURA: Oh, I feel so sick!

6787
05:21:21,046 --> 05:21:24,493
TRAVIS: I guess Tary lives another day.

6788
05:21:24,493 --> 05:21:30,492
SAM: I've learned a lesson! Always carry an
insurance policy with me.

6789
05:21:30,492 --> 05:21:32,490
MATT: Fair enough.

6790
05:21:32,490 --> 05:21:33,535
TALIESIN: I want to cry.

6791
05:21:33,535 --> 05:21:42,973
MATT: Well, guys, well done! You got the
lodestones and escaped with the body of Vax,

6792
05:21:42,973 --> 05:21:46,069
though dead. Had that last death saving throw
happened

6793
05:21:46,069 --> 05:21:49,039
in the stomach of the kraken, there was
no way you were getting back.

6794
05:21:49,039 --> 05:21:50,579
LAURA: So, that's good.

6795
05:21:50,579 --> 05:21:53,092
SAM: So, in a way, we won!

6796
05:21:53,092 --> 05:21:57,996
MATT: That's a silver lining. Anyway, guys, thank
you for sticking through a very long, climactic,

6797
05:21:57,996 --> 05:22:02,938
intense battle, both players and viewers. Thank
you, Lootcrate, for being our awesome sponsor.

6798
05:22:02,938 --> 05:22:04,110
TRAVIS: Thank you, Lootcrate!

6799
05:22:04,110 --> 05:22:10,231
MATT: We'll be back next week to see the
conclusion of this Aramente arc.

6800
05:22:10,231 --> 05:22:13,330
Much love to you all, and is it Thursday yet?

6801
05:22:13,330 --> 05:22:14,401
TRAVIS: Not for another week!

6802
05:22:14,401 --> 05:22:15,689
MATT: See you guys soon.

6803
05:22:15,689 --> 05:22:17,211
