00:00:00,535 --> 00:00:05,974
MATT: (as Victor) Welcome to tonight's episode of
Critical Role, our Halloween edition. Where a

2
00:00:05,974 --> 00:00:15,507
bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and
play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Hi. Tonight we will

3
00:00:15,507 --> 00:00:21,234
astound you with spooky tales. I don't know what's
going to happen as we are just going to continue

4
00:00:21,234 --> 00:00:26,139
the game that we normally play. Welcome, I'm
Matthew Mercer, dungeon master.

5
00:00:26,139 --> 00:00:29,592
(laughter)

6
00:00:29,592 --> 00:00:33,943
MATT: Those who don't recognise my costume, you're
really confused, especially if this is your first

7
00:00:33,943 --> 00:00:38,515
time tuning in. Sorry. (normal voice) I am not
dungeon mastering like that for the rest of the

8
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:40,988
evening because I will have to run into traffic
after an hour.

9
00:00:40,988 --> 00:00:45,225
(cheering)

10
00:00:45,225 --> 00:00:50,236
MATT: Guys, I want to give a quick thank you to
Amazon for delaying all my orders, making me put

11
00:00:50,236 --> 00:00:55,765
my costume together last minute out of shit I
found at Home Depot. So, thanks, Amazon. It's

12
00:00:55,765 --> 00:01:00,516
fantastic, I appreciate it. All right, anyway. I
guess we should go through everyone else's to see

13
00:01:00,516 --> 00:01:05,057
the magnificent costumes around us. Let's go and
start over here with our fantastic--

14
00:01:05,057 --> 00:01:18,748
SAM: I am Hotis! The rakshasa. And I cannot speak
with my mouth hole. (growls)

15
00:01:18,748 --> 00:01:25,070
TALIESIN: I have Clarota, but the mask is
currently on its way here because I didn't have

16
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,099
nearly enough coffee. So on the break there will
be a giant squiddy mask that is terrible, just

17
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:30,869
terrible. It's the worst thing.

18
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:38,288
MARISHA: Half Clarota! I am Doctor Anna Ripley,
from Wildemount.

19
00:01:38,288 --> 00:01:40,598
TRAVIS: You suck, Ripley!

20
00:01:40,598 --> 00:01:46,762
MARISHA: This is very heavy. This is a bludgeoning
weapon, it is not a piercing weapon. It is a

21
00:01:46,762 --> 00:01:58,918
bludgeoning weapon. Right hand to the Briarwoods.
And uber Percy fangirl. That's me. Cheers.

22
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:04,608
LAURA: Ooh! Nice, nice!

23
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:06,842
MATT: All right, Liam.

24
00:02:06,842 --> 00:02:11,696
LIAM: Hi, Hi. I am Tyriok. I make maps.

25
00:02:11,696 --> 00:02:13,969
SAM: Why are you having trouble picking that up?

26
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:20,279
LIAM: Oh, well. I was turned to stone recently and
I don't have two arms anymore. I have one. I can

27
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:32,471
still roll dice though and I have maps and I have
a compass and I am the least dangerous person at

28
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:40,021
the tables. I'm not level one in anything, really,
except maps. I'm level 15 in maps. I'm just happy

29
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:43,144
to be here and be alive. Mostly.

30
00:02:43,144 --> 00:02:45,315
LAURA: We've been opening doors for him all night.

31
00:02:45,315 --> 00:02:48,894
MATT: Thank you, Liam. That's awesome. Laura!

32
00:02:48,894 --> 00:02:55,528
LAURA: I'm Lady Briarwood. Here with the man I
broke the world for.

33
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:57,280
TRAVIS: You broke it for me, baby.

34
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,845
LAURA: That's right. You should say who you are.

35
00:03:02,845 --> 00:03:05,147
TRAVIS: Oh right. I'm Lord Briarwood.

36
00:03:05,147 --> 00:03:06,215
LAURA: Nice!

37
00:03:06,215 --> 00:03:11,586
TRAVIS: Yeah. Undead. Betrothed.

38
00:03:11,586 --> 00:03:14,246
LAURA: That's right. More than betrothed.

39
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:17,583
LIAM: Do you know, people who are in love high
five?

40
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:23,819
TRAVIS: We be representing the dead motherfuckers
in this game.

41
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,315
LAURA: I'm not dead.

42
00:03:25,315 --> 00:03:26,776
TRAVIS: Are you not?

43
00:03:26,776 --> 00:03:27,762
LAURA: No, man.

44
00:03:27,762 --> 00:03:29,486
LIAM and LAURA: Just inside.

45
00:03:29,486 --> 00:03:31,340
MARISHA: Actually, me and Travis are the only dead
ones.

46
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,315
LAURA: I guess. Well, I am dead. No, I am dead.

47
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:37,704
LIAM: Currently dead, but you weren't undead.

48
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:39,259
LAURA: Exactly. I misunderstood.

49
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:45,014
MATT: You're both dead. You're destroyed. You're
dead. You're somewhere--

50
00:03:45,014 --> 00:03:47,322
SAM: I'm in another plane of existence probably.

51
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:49,922
MATT: Yeah, you're having a real rough week right
now is what you're having.

52
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:51,076
LIAM: My arm is dead.

53
00:03:51,076 --> 00:03:52,865
LAURA: You're the only person alive.

54
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:53,982
LIAM: Cheers.

55
00:03:53,982 --> 00:03:56,664
LAURA: And you of course.

56
00:03:56,664 --> 00:03:58,196
MATT: (as Victor) Parts of me.

57
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:02,062
(laughter and cheering)

58
00:04:02,062 --> 00:04:04,399
MATT: (as Victor) What?

59
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,621
LAURA: Cheers, Victor!

60
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,957
TRAVIS: Yeah, cheers. Salut, bitches!

61
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,041
(cheering)

62
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,214
ALL: Happy Halloween!

63
00:04:11,214 --> 00:04:18,757
(laughter)

64
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:21,892
TRAVIS: I can't breathe.

65
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:23,275
LIAM: So that's it. That's the show.

66
00:04:23,275 --> 00:04:27,917
MATT: Yeah. Thanks guys, thanks for coming. We
shall get into our announcements for the evening.

67
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:35,814
I need my hand to do that. This is, by the way,
pre-finger loss Victor. As I know there will be

68
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,644
some purists out there like, why does he
have all his fingers on his right hand? Matt,

69
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,274
you're so inaccurate to your own character.

70
00:04:39,274 --> 00:04:40,491
TRAVIS: Wow.

71
00:04:40,491 --> 00:04:44,311
MATT: All right, so first and foremost, tonight's
episode is sponsored by Loot Crate.

72
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:45,254
TRAVIS: Loot Crate!

73
00:04:45,254 --> 00:04:47,121
(cheering)

74
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:49,153
LAURA: Get your maps off the table, Tyriok.

75
00:04:49,153 --> 00:04:50,430
LIAM: Sorry.

76
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,708
MATT: We've got an unboxing to do here with their
last theme here. But before we get to that, Sam

77
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:55,778
did you want to--

78
00:04:55,778 --> 00:05:04,088
SAM: I wanted to say guys that this month's theme
for Loot Crate is magic. And I don't have much

79
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:09,890
planned for tonight, but I did learn a magic
trick. I'm going to do a magic trick. It's my

80
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:14,628
first magic trick I've ever done. And I don't have
a deck of cards at home, so I'm going to use spell

81
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:19,115
cards instead. I'm going to give it a little
shuffle here. Oh, hey there, cowboy.

82
00:05:19,115 --> 00:05:21,385
TRAVIS: Oh, please let something come out of your
mouth.

83
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:24,166
SAM: Taliesin, can you give it a
shuffle?

84
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,252
TALIESIN: I'll give it a shuffle. Liam, do you
want to shuffle?

85
00:05:27,252 --> 00:05:30,934
LIAM: Sure, I've got it. We got 30 minutes,
right?

86
00:05:30,934 --> 00:05:42,058
SAM: Get ready for November's enchanting theme:
Magical! We've cast a powerful, ancient spell to

87
00:05:42,104 --> 00:05:49,531
deliver you this 100% exclusive crate. Featuring
bewitching items from Doctor Strange, Fantastic

88
00:05:49,531 --> 00:05:59,378
Beasts and Where to Find Them, Big Trouble in
Little China. And more! Use the promo link:

90
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:07,974
MATT: Marvel as Sam slowly becomes Bill Cosby.
(Cosby impression) You see!

91
00:06:07,974 --> 00:06:10,851
LIAM: No, no, no, you can't take that back!

92
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:19,920
SAM: I'm going to show Taliesin that these are, in
fact, randomly shuffled cards. Can you please give

93
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,634
the card deck a little cut anywhere you'd like.
I'm going to look at this half of the card deck

94
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:32,572
and it'll tell me what's in the other half of the
card deck. Okay. I know, Taliesin, by looking at

95
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:37,348
that, that the fourth card down is See
Invisibility.

96
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:39,916
TALIESIN: The fourth card down.

97
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,580
SAM: The fourth card down is See Invisibility.

98
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,961
TALIESIN: So, this card here will be--

99
00:06:45,961 --> 00:06:47,457
SAM: Will be See Invisibility!

100
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:52,160
TALIESIN: It's like Nicholas Cage as a cat. It is,
in fact, See Invisibility!

101
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,615
(cheering)

102
00:06:55,615 --> 00:07:01,369
SAM: The most magical part of this trick is is
that it makes me a quadruple threat: Actor!

103
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:09,439
Singer! Professional Lover of Ladies! And now,
Professional Magician. Thank you, Loot Crate.

104
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,898
(cheering)

105
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:17,225
TALIESIN: Remarkable Nicholas Cage impersonator,
too, it's really amazing.

106
00:07:17,225 --> 00:07:19,694
SAM: My mouth hurts so much right now.

107
00:07:19,694 --> 00:07:31,106
MATT: Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Loot Crate! Yeah,
open your Loot Crates.

108
00:07:31,106 --> 00:07:35,024
LAURA: These are from October. These are not the
current ones.

109
00:07:35,024 --> 00:07:36,575
TALIESIN: These are not the magic theme.

110
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:38,249
MARISHA: No, it's the horror theme.

111
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,894
SAM: This is what everyone should be getting this
month.

112
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:47,346
LAURA: Okay, that's the coolest.

113
00:07:47,346 --> 00:07:49,148
TRAVIS: Are those Freddy Kruger chopsticks?

114
00:07:49,148 --> 00:07:50,417
LAURA: Yes, I think.

115
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:51,698
MATT: That's pretty badass.

116
00:07:51,698 --> 00:07:53,842
MARISHA: Little chibi Leatherface!

117
00:07:53,842 --> 00:07:59,585
TRAVIS: Of all the things you thought could never
be cute. Leatherface.

118
00:07:59,585 --> 00:08:00,784
MARISHA: Little Leatherface.

119
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:02,987
LAURA: I have to see if these are actually usable
or not.

120
00:08:02,987 --> 00:08:04,794
MATT: Negan shirt.

121
00:08:04,794 --> 00:08:06,194
LIAM: Got it! It's off!

122
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,412
MATT: Well done, Liam, well done.

123
00:08:08,412 --> 00:08:09,886
TRAVIS: Camp Crystal Lake.

124
00:08:09,886 --> 00:08:13,968
SAM: Ooh, a little pennant. My son will love that,
big fan of the movie.

125
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:16,381
LIAM: I'm going to wear this for my kids all the
time.

126
00:08:16,381 --> 00:08:18,159
MATT: Regrettable Supervillains.

127
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:24,321
TALIESIN: Too soon, guys, too soon. Just too
soon.

128
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:34,187
TRAVIS: Preying Mantis man. Cat Girl.

129
00:08:34,187 --> 00:08:39,464
TALIESIN: Camp Crystal Lake, oh that makes me
happy.

130
00:08:39,464 --> 00:08:41,970
SAM: These chopsticks are amazing.

131
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:48,798
LAURA: The chopsticks are awesome, but don't try
to pick up metal dice with them because they're

132
00:08:48,798 --> 00:08:50,020
way too heavy.

133
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,145
LIAM and LAURA: Don't eat metal dice.

134
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:56,170
TRAVIS: Ooh, the Walking Dead t-shirt. I call dibs
on this next week!

135
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:01,949
MATT: There you go. Thank you very much, Loot
Crate, for sponsoring us. You can go to

136
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:03,794
lootcrate.com/criticalrole.

137
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:07,852
TRAVIS: Promo code "criticalrole."

138
00:09:07,852 --> 00:09:09,337
LIAM: Beginner's luck.

139
00:09:09,337 --> 00:09:10,294
LAURA: That's right.

140
00:09:10,294 --> 00:09:11,077
TRAVIS: Good job.

141
00:09:11,077 --> 00:09:12,717
TALIESIN: That one's going to fail you every time,
now.

142
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:19,904
MATT: That would have been impressive. Next up,
let's see. GM Tips. We now have the second episode

143
00:09:19,904 --> 00:09:23,905
that just went up on YouTube. They go up a couple
of days early on Alpha if you want to check that

144
00:09:23,905 --> 00:09:30,377
out. The most recent episode deals with
improvisation, dealing with the unexpected. I'm a

145
00:09:30,377 --> 00:09:33,946
big fan of this new run. We get to go a little
more in-depth with the elements of running your

147
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:41,543
coming out for the next six or so weeks. I can't
remember how many episodes we did. So, for a

while, so every week, a new one coming. Alpha on

TRAVIS: Titanfall 2!

151
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:03,151
MATT: It's fun. I play Jack Cooper, your
protagonist in the single-player campaign. It's

152
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:05,584
basically a future buddy cop film with a giant
robot.

153
00:10:05,584 --> 00:10:07,806
TRAVIS: You sound sexy in that, man. Just
saying.

154
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:09,255
MATT: Thank you.

155
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:10,086
LAURA: You do!

156
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:11,175
TRAVIS: High noon!

157
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:13,655
MATT: (as Victor) It's how I like it! I'm like
this the entire game!

158
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,689
TRAVIS: That's a whole different Titanfall.

159
00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:20,804
LIAM: I'm in there too! I've returned from the
first game as Barker and I will yell at you if

160
00:10:20,804 --> 00:10:26,180
you're in my faction. Damn, that's got some weight
to it, son! Mmm!

161
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,997
MARISHA: At least a d8.

162
00:10:27,997 --> 00:10:29,385
LIAM: (explosion noise)

163
00:10:29,385 --> 00:10:31,383
MATT: And that was the end of Tyriok.

164
00:10:31,383 --> 00:10:32,904
LIAM: (as Tyriok) I shot something else off!

165
00:10:32,904 --> 00:10:34,510
MATT: (laughs) Oh god.

166
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:41,884
TRAVIS: Oh yeah! Telltale's Batman episode three
came out. I really like the way that's going. Fun.

167
00:10:41,884 --> 00:10:44,554
LAURA: There's some good stuff happening in that
episode.

168
00:10:44,554 --> 00:10:46,222
LIAM: Who is this Batman character?

169
00:10:46,222 --> 00:10:53,085
MATT: Next up, our Critical Role Halloween costume
contest finishes next week. Halloween night is the

170
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:56,211
last time to submit so if you have a Halloween
costume if you haven't finished yet, get it

171
00:10:56,211 --> 00:11:00,532
finished, put up some photos with the hashtag
#criticalcostumes on Twitter. We will be judging

172
00:11:00,532 --> 00:11:04,064
those in the coming week and giving you guys
prizes and rewards and all the silliness that we

173
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:07,792
can try and produce for you because we're excited.
So many good things are already out there. You guys

174
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,431
have been crazy!

175
00:11:09,431 --> 00:11:11,068
LAURA: Yeah. There's been some really
phenomenal--

176
00:11:11,068 --> 00:11:13,348
SAM: Can I enter the contest as this?

177
00:11:13,348 --> 00:11:16,804
MATT: I believe you already have, and you can win all of
your shirts back.

178
00:11:16,804 --> 00:11:19,406
SAM: Oh shit! Then I do not want to
do that.

179
00:11:19,453 --> 00:11:21,738
(laughter)

180
00:11:21,738 --> 00:11:26,402
MATT: Fantastic. Marisha. There is a new Signal
Boost episode.

181
00:11:26,402 --> 00:11:31,620
MARISHA: Oh yeah! Both the Signal Boost Halloween
episodes are out. And Taliesin and I are in them.

182
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,879
And you make a cameo in the latest episode.

183
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,940
MATT: I stare at a mirror. It's fun.

184
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:43,231
MARISHA: Yeah. Go watch for Halloween.

185
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:47,875
MATT: Travis. How about Talks Machina?

186
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:53,158
TRAVIS: Yes! We are super excited about this one.
Starting November 15th and every Tuesday after on

187
00:11:53,158 --> 00:11:58,207
Alpha we will finally get to introduce Talks
Machina which is our Critical Role talk show.

188
00:11:58,207 --> 00:12:04,272
Hosted by our amazing friend Brian Wayne Foster.
You can follow him at Brian Wayne Foster something

189
00:12:04,272 --> 00:12:05,133
something.

190
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:06,524
MARISHA: It's like @brianwfoster.

191
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:12,868
TRAVIS: @brianwfoster. And you can also catch the
Talks Machina page on Twitter @talksmachina. You

192
00:12:12,868 --> 00:12:17,459
can also get early access if you go to
alphainvite.com for early access to the page.

193
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:21,893
We're going to be on there; it's our chance to
give insight after the game. It'll be a weekly

194
00:12:21,893 --> 00:12:26,593
thing so we can answer questions that people might
have, talk about moments that happened, how it

195
00:12:26,593 --> 00:12:30,633
went well, how it didn't, how we suck. There will
always be a few of us on there every week, we

196
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:34,301
might even have some guests, and some segments!
It's going to be awesome. It's something we've

197
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:35,504
been wanting to do for a while--

198
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,389
LAURA: Yeah. And Brian's a really awesome guy so
we're excited about it.

199
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:40,978
MARISHA: Yeah. You guys are going to love him. He
is great.

200
00:12:40,978 --> 00:12:42,241
MATT: Brian is awesome.

201
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:43,392
TRAVIS: Yeah. Hai!

202
00:12:43,392 --> 00:12:54,886
MATT: Hai! That's all the major business
announcements. The final announcement, for those

203
00:12:54,886 --> 00:13:01,580
who weren't paying attention to social media.
Yeah. Take your glove off.

204
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,908
MARISHA: Oh!

205
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,536
TRAVIS: Take it off! Take that glove off!

206
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:07,461
TALIESIN: We're doing that.

207
00:13:07,461 --> 00:13:08,952
SAM: That's no fake hand!

208
00:13:08,952 --> 00:13:10,686
TRAVIS: That ring better be there!

209
00:13:10,686 --> 00:13:12,265
MARISHA: He put a ring on it!

210
00:13:12,265 --> 00:13:15,129
(cheering)

211
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:17,676
LIAM: Applause, applause, applause!

212
00:13:17,676 --> 00:13:21,961
MARISHA: I have <i>that</i> to look forward to in my
later years.

213
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:24,006
MATT: (as Victor) So excited!

214
00:13:24,006 --> 00:13:26,548
LAURA: Congratulations!

215
00:13:26,548 --> 00:13:29,123
LIAM: I mean, he doesn't have to take it off!

216
00:13:29,123 --> 00:13:32,822
MATT: (as Victor) Only parts of it.

217
00:13:32,822 --> 00:13:36,706
SAM: Are we going to do a Critical Role themed
wedding?

218
00:13:36,706 --> 00:13:38,026
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

219
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,375
MARISHA: No. No.

220
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:44,522
MATT: That's not going to be a thing. But we have
already decided on our date.

221
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:51,374
MARISHA: Although I might still have Travis
Willingham as my flower girl. Doing the dust of

222
00:13:51,374 --> 00:13:52,825
tracelessness.

223
00:13:52,825 --> 00:13:54,441
TRAVIS: I would be honored.

224
00:13:54,441 --> 00:13:56,114
TALIESIN: So cute!

225
00:13:56,114 --> 00:14:03,435
SAM: I'll start writing my Best Man speech. It'll
be a song.

226
00:14:03,435 --> 00:14:05,705
MATT: All the limericks in one.

227
00:14:05,705 --> 00:14:07,270
LIAM: Delivered in tiger?

228
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,546
SAM: Yes. Delivered in tiger makeup.

229
00:14:09,546 --> 00:14:17,094
MATT: You've now done a tiger outfit twice. Two
different tigers. All right. On that note, let's

230
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:21,428
go ahead and dive in to tonight's episode of
Halloween Critical Role.

231
00:14:21,428 --> 00:15:51,907
[dramatic music]

232
00:15:51,907 --> 00:16:06,706
MATT: Welcome back. As we last left off, our band
of adventurers, Vox Machina, were in the process

233
00:16:06,706 --> 00:16:12,739
of formulating their plan of attack against the
Chroma Conclave, a group of chromatic dragons that

234
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:21,556
had banded together under their king, a
massive-sized red dragon that sundered the

235
00:16:21,556 --> 00:16:27,691
Tal'Dorei countryside and currently sits on the
main city of Emon. You have traversed multiple

236
00:16:27,691 --> 00:16:32,747
planes of the world and have gathered these
various artifacts called the Vestiges of

237
00:16:32,747 --> 00:16:38,736
Divergence in preparation for this battle, honing
your skills. You guys, after finally defeating

238
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:44,135
your third member of the Conclave and allying with
a fourth, Raishan, you defeated Vorugal, the white

239
00:16:44,135 --> 00:16:50,619
dragon, over in the ruins of Draconia in
Wildemount. You are now returning, after gathering

240
00:16:50,619 --> 00:16:55,501
the spoils of the fight, making your way to the
next leg of your journey, to the very, very fast

241
00:16:55,501 --> 00:17:01,210
approaching conflict with the Cinder King himself.
And that's where we begin. Last we left off in the

242
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:07,605
middle of a nearby frozen forest, Percival and
Vex, probably a fair distance of time apart make

243
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:08,776
your-- no.

244
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:11,706
(laughter)

245
00:17:11,706 --> 00:17:13,468
LIAM: That's "later."

246
00:17:13,468 --> 00:17:17,513
MATT: Jumped the gun.

247
00:17:17,513 --> 00:17:21,600
LIAM: Matt, I don't know how we're going to do
this. I got to look right at you.

248
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,656
LAURA: Look directly below. Maybe stare at his
eyes.

249
00:17:25,656 --> 00:17:27,753
LIAM: I'm going to look at the torch over his
right shoulder.

250
00:17:27,753 --> 00:17:32,027
(laughter)

251
00:17:32,027 --> 00:17:34,392
TRAVIS: He's missing so many teeth!

252
00:17:34,392 --> 00:17:40,457
LIAM: We got to go shopping or drinking or
something, nothing serious for the love of

253
00:17:40,457 --> 00:17:42,188
Sarenrae.

254
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:50,395
MATT: So! As you guys reconvene towards Scanlan's
Magnificent Mansion to prepare for the next leg of

255
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:52,179
your journey, what do you wish to do?

256
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:55,102
SAM: Wait, we're in the Mansion right now?

257
00:17:55,155 --> 00:17:58,515
LAURA: No, we're at the top of the ravine.

258
00:17:58,515 --> 00:18:01,275
TALISAN: We're preparing to go through a portal.

259
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:03,452
MATT: Correct, you guys are. So you've gathered to
go ahead and make--

260
00:18:03,452 --> 00:18:06,064
LAURA: Did you want to sleep before we went back
to Whitestone?

261
00:18:06,064 --> 00:18:13,511
MARISHA: No, I can go. Yeah, no. It's been eight
hours, I've done my thing?

262
00:18:13,511 --> 00:18:21,508
MATT: Yes, for the restoring some of the farmland,
yeah. Which as you complete the entirety of the

263
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:27,032
spell, you watch as the rest of the snow melt
begins to turn to water, and you watch as the land

264
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:29,855
itself grows more fertile and the crops begin to
pop forth. Like you began to see when the ritual

265
00:18:29,855 --> 00:18:35,974
initiated itself. With the completion of the land
cleansed, you are free to go to the next length of

266
00:18:35,974 --> 00:18:37,229
your journey.

267
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:40,411
MARISHA: Sorry.

268
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:44,564
TALIESIN: Stop, I can't make eye contact. I'm
sorry, it's okay. We'll get there.

269
00:18:44,564 --> 00:18:46,262
LAURA: I think you look great, Matt.

270
00:18:46,262 --> 00:18:48,639
LIAM: You look like Doc Brown exploded, I don't
know what to do.

271
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:52,704
TALIESIN: Pat that tuft of hair down.

272
00:18:52,704 --> 00:18:59,732
MATT: Marty! Okay. Happy Halloween.

273
00:18:59,732 --> 00:19:01,973
LIAM: 30 more minutes, 30 more minutes and we'll
settle down.

274
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:05,353
MARISHA: You have to get immune to it.

275
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:11,250
LIAM: I would like to set the Deathwalker's Ward
to Matthew's costume.

276
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,209
MATT: All right, you take a short rest to set
your-- (laughs).

277
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:18,776
LIAM: That's from Vasselheim.

278
00:19:18,776 --> 00:19:23,497
MATT: What else do you guys wish to do? What's the
next step in your journey?

279
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:27,884
SAM: I mean we got to go back to Whitestone, right
away? Is there anything else to do here? Is there

280
00:19:27,884 --> 00:19:33,871
anything to deliver, any piece of any body to take
with us? Anything? We got everything already?

281
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:38,761
LAURA: We need to deliver Ripley's arm back in
Ank'Harel.

282
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:39,961
SAM: Okay.

283
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:41,112
LAURA: That needs to happen.

284
00:19:41,112 --> 00:19:42,285
SAM: Sure.

285
00:19:42,285 --> 00:19:44,238
LAURA: Kashaw's in Vasselheim.

286
00:19:44,238 --> 00:19:45,261
SAM: Sure.

287
00:19:45,261 --> 00:19:46,400
LAURA: We need to do something about him.

288
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,682
MARISHA: He might be in Whitestone by now.

289
00:19:47,682 --> 00:19:49,730
LAURA: He might be back. He might be on his way
here.

290
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:54,567
TRAVIS: He's a dick, he can take care of himself.

291
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:59,354
LAURA: Hopefully, he won't just loose something 
on the Ravenites here.

292
00:19:59,402 --> 00:20:03,556
SAM: Let's get out of here.

293
00:20:03,556 --> 00:20:06,097
MARISHA: They've been through so much.

294
00:20:06,097 --> 00:20:11,782
LIAM: I mean it's really reconfirming his whole
life-view so, you know. Hi!

295
00:20:11,782 --> 00:20:13,147
LAURA: Hi!

296
00:20:13,147 --> 00:20:14,773
TRAVIS: I'm having trouble.

297
00:20:14,773 --> 00:20:19,175
SAM: All right. Keyleth! Cast your thing and let's
get the fuck out of here.

298
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:22,118
LAURA: Let's get on to Whitestone. Get on getting
on.

299
00:20:22,118 --> 00:20:25,491
MARISHA: I'm coming, boo.

300
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:30,500
MATT: As you focus and touch the outside of the
tree, you watch as this small, familiar portal

301
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,577
begins to tear its way through the outer bark of
the nearby trunk. From there, as you reach through

302
00:20:35,577 --> 00:20:38,798
the magic creating this portal between you and
Whitestone, you hear the voice echo in the

303
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:46,673
distance, "I hear you." And thus, the temporary
doorway between here and Whitestone is open. The

304
00:20:46,673 --> 00:20:53,550
rest of you guys rush through, with Kima and Pike
in tow, you make your way into Whitestone itself.

305
00:20:53,550 --> 00:21:02,715
At this point in time, it looks like it's fairly
late in the afternoon. It's still day here, that's

306
00:21:02,715 --> 00:21:10,203
a day, eight hours there. Actually no, it would be
pretty early morning by here. At this point, you

307
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:16,913
step out and the sky is starting to come to light.
You see the blue slowly transitioning into a light

308
00:21:16,913 --> 00:21:20,637
orange to a yellow as the sunrise is making its
way over the mountain range that surrounds the

309
00:21:20,637 --> 00:21:26,651
outside of Whitestone. You're met with a few
wandering guards that wander through the town that

310
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:31,185
acknowledge your presence, but it is your call as
to what you wish to do now.

311
00:21:31,185 --> 00:21:42,177
SAM: Does the town look like it's safe and
intact?

312
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:45,580
MATT: It seems like it hasn't suffered any sort of
incursion or attack, yeah.

313
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,782
SAM: Okay, yeah. That's good.

314
00:21:46,782 --> 00:21:48,595
MARISHA: We've only been gone for what? 24 hours?

315
00:21:48,595 --> 00:21:50,405
LAURA: No, like two days because we slept there.

316
00:21:50,405 --> 00:21:51,816
TALIESIN: About two days.

317
00:21:51,816 --> 00:21:54,322
MARISHA: I'm going to go check and see if I can
find Kash.

318
00:21:54,322 --> 00:22:01,375
TALIESIN: Also going to head towards the castle.
And we should drop off some of our spoils.

319
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,788
LAURA: Our loot.

320
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,634
TRAVIS: Where? Where do we drop them off at?

321
00:22:04,634 --> 00:22:06,374
LAURA: The castle?

322
00:22:06,374 --> 00:22:09,384
TALIESIN: I would imagine the treasury room is
where it can be.

323
00:22:09,384 --> 00:22:12,419
MATT: There is a treasury vault in the Whitestone
castle.

324
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:16,419
TRAVIS: Oh. Cool. Yeah. Totally knew about that
place.

325
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:23,521
MATT: All right, Pike says she's going to go and
check in with the temple and make sure everything

326
00:22:23,521 --> 00:22:29,508
there is taken care of and situated. Kima leaves
with you guys towards the Whitestone castle. As

327
00:22:29,508 --> 00:22:32,980
you make your way up, you get to the very outside
of the castle at the time the sunrise finally

328
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,286
breaks the mountain range and you see the sun
coming in. What little bit of mist begins to

329
00:22:37,286 --> 00:22:43,157
slowly burn off of the surrounding forested area.
The cold, brisk morning air is immediately met

330
00:22:43,157 --> 00:22:48,147
with that warm ray of sun hitting you and it's
welcoming both to be returning to a place of

331
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:53,288
comfort but also the transition into day itself is
a very warm and welcoming experience. As you step

332
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:58,245
towards the front, there are four guards at the
front gate. They step aside to let you in. As you

333
00:22:58,245 --> 00:23:06,504
step into the main foyer of the area, you already
see a familiar sight. You see there waiting, arms

334
00:23:06,504 --> 00:23:09,840
crossed, leaning against the wall, Seeker Asum.

335
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,839
LAURA: Scars still on the face?

336
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:22,282
MATT: Yeah, still acid-pocked scar across the
right side, ruining the tattooed face. The rest of

337
00:23:22,282 --> 00:23:25,851
the castle seems relatively quiet at this time, as
it is very early.

338
00:23:25,851 --> 00:23:28,749
MARISHA: She's the only one-- <i>he's</i> the only one
there?

339
00:23:28,749 --> 00:23:35,478
MATT: Within the actual foyer of the castle, yes,
the main entrance area. As you guys begin to step

340
00:23:35,478 --> 00:23:48,429
inside, Seeker Asum steps in your direction. Steps
in your direction, and Kima is already taking a

341
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:54,385
brisk walk in that direction and goes, pointing
outward toward Seeker Asum. "Now--"

342
00:23:54,385 --> 00:24:04,151
MARISHA: I grab Kima by the wrist. Not right now,
maybe?

343
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:10,599
MATT: "Now you told me you'd already met with a
creature. This is the--" At which point, Seeker

344
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:16,964
Asum's hands rest on to Kima's shoulder. Kima's
head whips around to face Asum, and Asum says,

345
00:24:16,964 --> 00:24:20,467
"You need not worry."

346
00:24:20,467 --> 00:24:24,411
SAM: He's going to try a thing on her.

347
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:26,744
LAURA: She <i>hates</i> that!

348
00:24:26,744 --> 00:24:28,580
SAM: She doesn't like it.

349
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,844
MARISHA: Oh no.

350
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,371
TALIESIN: He's going to the sheets.

351
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:35,781
MATT: Kima's eyes blink for a moment and she--

352
00:24:35,781 --> 00:24:40,323
MARISHA: No no no no no no. I still have my hands
on Kima, right?

353
00:24:40,323 --> 00:24:41,125
MATT: Yeah.

354
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:45,749
MARISHA: I counter with a 6th-level Dispel Magic.
Can I do that?

355
00:24:45,749 --> 00:24:47,414
MATT: You can certainly try.

356
00:24:47,414 --> 00:24:48,801
MARISHA: Fuck.

357
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:50,807
MATT: All right, so as you begin to--

358
00:24:50,807 --> 00:24:54,165
LAURA: Oh no, we're going to start a fight, that's
going to start a fight.

359
00:24:54,165 --> 00:24:59,050
MARISHA: I don't want her to fucking cast any shit
on Kima.

360
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:01,876
TRAVIS: What if it was just a chill out spell?

361
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:08,033
MARISHA: It's probably a charm spell. Or a memory
spell. No, I don't want to fucking wait--

362
00:25:08,033 --> 00:25:11,885
MATT: It's not a Counterspell, but you can try to
cast it on her to see if it has any effect.

363
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,801
MARISHA: Okay.

364
00:25:13,801 --> 00:25:20,872
MATT: All righty, so the DC of the spell-- okay.
So, as you pull back and begin chanting to

365
00:25:20,872 --> 00:25:25,621
yourself, clutching Kima and pulling her away from
Asum, Asum's grip leaves Kima's shoulder and Kima's

366
00:25:25,621 --> 00:25:30,312
still shaking her head groggily. You finish the
Dispel Magic and you feel the strange, warm pulse

367
00:25:30,312 --> 00:25:39,263
of energy radiate briefly out from Kima's body.
Kima turns to look at you and goes, "What-- why

368
00:25:39,263 --> 00:25:49,504
"would-- I'm sorry, I went groggy there for a
second. We've had a long day. Good to see you,

369
00:25:49,504 --> 00:26:02,147
"Asum." And Asum nods and says, "Well, the pleasure
is mine. Glad to see you all made it back safe and sound."

370
00:26:02,147 --> 00:26:07,629
SAM: Yes we did. Thank you, Asum.

371
00:26:07,629 --> 00:26:16,400
MATT: "We have a meeting set here in the next two
hours to gather our information and best situate

372
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:27,462
"the next plan of action. You also have a friend
waiting for you. Your armored Kashaw returned but

373
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:33,045
"a half day ago apparently. Sleeping at the moment
should you be interested in waking him from his

374
00:26:33,045 --> 00:26:39,262
"slumber and notifying him of his, well, his
services no longer being needed."

375
00:26:39,262 --> 00:26:41,368
TRAVIS: Did he return alone?

376
00:26:41,368 --> 00:26:44,746
MATT: "He did. And rather proud with his
findings."

377
00:26:44,746 --> 00:26:50,676
LAURA: Oh shit. Where are you off to now?

378
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:52,863
MATT: "Oh, I'm here waiting for the meeting."

379
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:54,236
LAURA: Lovely.

380
00:26:54,236 --> 00:26:56,484
MARISHA: And who all is going to be a part of this
meeting?

381
00:26:56,484 --> 00:27:00,706
MATT: "As far as I know, it's going to be myself,
Cassandra, Allura, and Drake."

382
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:06,310
LAURA: Oh, good! Allura, we haven't seen her in
forever. Have we?

383
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,076
SAM: We saw her pretty recently.

384
00:27:08,076 --> 00:27:13,113
LAURA: We did. Shit. Yes, we did. Never mind.

385
00:27:13,113 --> 00:27:15,692
SAM: All right. Well then, until the meeting?

386
00:27:15,692 --> 00:27:24,526
MATT: "Until the meeting. Now, food should be
ready." And Asum steps out into the sunshine and

387
00:27:24,526 --> 00:27:30,512
closes his eyes, takes a deep breath as the sun
rays hit and looks over his shoulder, smiles, and

388
00:27:30,512 --> 00:27:33,505
continues to walk down the path in towards
Whitestone itself.

389
00:27:33,505 --> 00:27:35,262
SAM: We can kill him right here, right now!

390
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:36,400
MARISHA: (groans)

391
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,123
TRAVIS: No, no. (coughs)

392
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:45,109
MATT: Kima takes a couple steps and says, "Wow,
I'm more tired than I expected after that fight.

393
00:27:45,109 --> 00:27:48,333
"Then again, we did kill a dragon! And that is
<i>fantastic</i>!"

394
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,716
TRAVIS: We did. Yeah. And you got a brilliant new
sword.

395
00:27:51,716 --> 00:27:56,691
MATT: Which she pulls out and (swish). You can see
the arc of light streak across the blade as she

396
00:27:56,691 --> 00:28:02,340
flings it in the air with incredible strength for
a halfling of her size. She's still marveled by

397
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:08,555
it. "You know what? I'm not going to sleep. I'm
going to go practice!" And she goes and runs off

398
00:28:08,555 --> 00:28:11,978
down one of the hallways towards one of the castle's
training rooms.

399
00:28:11,978 --> 00:28:20,000
TRAVIS: Wait, Kima, Kima! You don't hear anything
when you use that, do you? Like voices or someone

400
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,126
talking to you or--

401
00:28:22,126 --> 00:28:26,586
MATT: She holds the blade up to her ear. "No."

402
00:28:26,586 --> 00:28:32,280
TRAVIS: No, good! Good. It's a beginner problem,
but you're quite advanced. Not worried about it.

403
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,675
Enjoy!

404
00:28:33,675 --> 00:28:39,405
MATT: "Thanks, Grog!" Slaps you on the shoulder
with an awkward glance and continues the

405
00:28:39,405 --> 00:28:43,210
excited steps forward into vanishing somewhere
into the castle.

406
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,662
TRAVIS: The sword is clean.

407
00:28:44,662 --> 00:28:46,914
LAURA: Good job.

408
00:28:46,914 --> 00:28:49,623
TRAVIS: Yeah. Dodged a bullet on that one!

409
00:28:49,623 --> 00:28:52,235
LAURA: We should put that hide in the Treasury.

410
00:28:52,235 --> 00:28:53,666
TRAVIS: Hide?

411
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:57,396
LAURA: The 140 pounds of dragonhide you're
carrying right now?

412
00:28:57,396 --> 00:28:59,811
TRAVIS: Oh right! I'm dragging it behind me.

413
00:28:59,811 --> 00:29:00,891
LAURA: Yeah.

414
00:29:00,891 --> 00:29:02,295
TRAVIS: Yeah. Right.

415
00:29:02,295 --> 00:29:06,344
TALIESIN: Like a body in a carpet.

416
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:09,765
TRAVIS: Well, I'm off to deposit this hide!

417
00:29:09,765 --> 00:29:11,330
SAM: Good object work!

418
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:18,448
TRAVIS: Yeah. Boy, I'm going to need to switch
shoulders! Getting a little roll in the ol' righty there.

419
00:29:18,448 --> 00:29:27,344
MARISHA: Keyleth grabs Vax as they wander off and
pulls him behind the rest of the crowd.

420
00:29:27,344 --> 00:29:31,469
MATT: Okay.

421
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:33,097
MARISHA: Let's go.

422
00:29:33,097 --> 00:29:34,253
LIAM: Where?

423
00:29:34,253 --> 00:29:35,936
MARISHA: Let's track Raishan.

424
00:29:35,936 --> 00:29:37,428
LIAM: All right.

425
00:29:37,428 --> 00:29:46,131
MARISHA: Let's track her. Let's just do it right
now. Let's kill her. We can do it, she won't be

426
00:29:46,131 --> 00:29:49,556
expecting it. We can find her.

427
00:29:49,556 --> 00:29:55,004
LIAM: I pull her further away. She won't expect
it, but she is a fucking ancient being.

428
00:29:55,004 --> 00:30:01,696
MARISHA: But she's sick and she-- We can do it
right now. When she's not armed.

429
00:30:01,696 --> 00:30:04,704
LIAM: Keyleth, I want to kill a dragon as much as
you do.

430
00:30:04,704 --> 00:30:07,279
MARISHA: It's not about killing a dragon, it's
about killing <i>her</i>.

431
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:14,188
LIAM: I know, but we want it to work. We want her
to die. And if you and I do it, it's not going to

432
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:22,069
happen. Her being sick is still up here. We need
the others. I really want to use both my arms to

433
00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:29,933
take her, but I can't. I take her by the arms. And
we need the others. If I thought we could do it--

434
00:30:29,933 --> 00:30:40,052
Listen to me. I love you, and if you ask me again,
I will go with you. But I don't think it will

435
00:30:40,052 --> 00:30:45,745
work. I think you and I will die. I think Raishan
will spit on our bodies. You will not get what you

436
00:30:45,745 --> 00:30:53,194
want. And then Thordak won't die. No one will be
happy. I understand--

437
00:30:53,194 --> 00:30:55,212
MARISHA: I just want this to be over.

438
00:30:55,212 --> 00:30:59,478
LIAM: I want this to be over.

439
00:30:59,478 --> 00:31:03,204
MARISHA: Okay.

440
00:31:03,204 --> 00:31:05,525
LIAM: We need to stay with the others; there's--

441
00:31:05,525 --> 00:31:09,279
MARISHA: Okay. Okay. I understand.

442
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:20,868
LIAM: Listen to me; if you tell me to go in, I
will go in. But there's strength with the others.

443
00:31:20,868 --> 00:31:29,267
After this, if you tell me to go in, you say the
word. It's not like I haven't tried to throw my

444
00:31:29,267 --> 00:31:32,496
life away already. You think I wouldn't do it for
you?

445
00:31:32,496 --> 00:31:39,761
MARISHA: I feel like it's very telling when Grog
has more patience than I. (sighs) Okay.

446
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:44,193
LIAM: Hey. It'll happen.

447
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:53,164
MARISHA: I just don't want to wait so long that she
gets the upper hand on us. The longer we wait, the

448
00:31:53,164 --> 00:31:58,089
more she learns about us. The more we're letting
her in, the more we're revealing. I feel like the

449
00:31:58,089 --> 00:32:02,289
longer we wait, the closer is her inevitable
betrayal.

450
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:14,562
LIAM: Pulls her in and touch foreheads. I don't
think we're going to be waiting for long; I

451
00:32:14,562 --> 00:32:16,242
really don't.

452
00:32:16,242 --> 00:32:20,196
MARISHA: Okay. Let's catch up with the others.

453
00:32:20,196 --> 00:32:24,026
LIAM: Yeah. Yeah.

454
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:27,662
MATT: The rest of you, what have you been up to?

455
00:32:27,662 --> 00:32:31,001
SAM: I pull Percy aside and say, we can kill her
right now.

456
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:34,769
LIAM: Ugh! It's a tiger!

457
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:38,572
TALIESIN: Well?

458
00:32:38,572 --> 00:32:40,765
SAM: Well, we got to go to the treasury.

459
00:32:40,765 --> 00:32:42,157
TALIESIN: We have to go to the treasury.

460
00:32:42,157 --> 00:32:47,755
SAM: And then what? Who do we need to check in
with? Everyone, right? Gilmore and Kash and--

461
00:32:47,755 --> 00:32:49,558
LAURA: We've got a couple hours.

462
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:53,148
TALIESIN: We have a couple hours. We need to talk
to people. We need to find out where this

463
00:32:53,148 --> 00:32:57,100
meeting's being held, if it's being held
downstairs or if it's being held in the battle room.

464
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,752
LAURA: It won't be if Asum has anything to say
about it.

465
00:32:58,752 --> 00:33:00,629
TALIESIN: Well, maybe he won't.

466
00:33:00,629 --> 00:33:07,453
SAM: And what is this meeting? I know that we have
to have a conversation with Asum.

467
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:09,245
MARISHA: Yeah, but what is this about?

468
00:33:09,245 --> 00:33:16,619
TALIESIN: This meeting may be the beginning of
something very violent or this may be the start of

469
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:22,613
something; I don't know. But be prepared perhaps
that this meeting may be on moment.

470
00:33:22,613 --> 00:33:24,928
TRAVIS: (singing) Be prepared.

471
00:33:24,928 --> 00:33:30,508
TALIESIN: Don't think about it. Don't plan. Don't
have any thoughts in your head.

472
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:34,222
LAURA: Improvise. We're good at that.

473
00:33:34,222 --> 00:33:42,783
TALIESIN: You can't lie about anything. Do not lie
to her about anything. And one of the ways we can

474
00:33:42,783 --> 00:33:49,672
lie best is by truthfully saying we have no plans
against her right now because we have no plans

475
00:33:49,672 --> 00:33:59,736
against her right now. The more we talk, the more
she will be able to perceive our deceptions, if we

476
00:33:59,736 --> 00:34:11,763
have any. Be very careful. This is going to be
very dangerous. There's going to be a lot of

477
00:34:11,763 --> 00:34:13,539
improvisation.

478
00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:16,742
LAURA: I hate knowing that she's going to be able
to hear all of our plans.

479
00:34:16,742 --> 00:34:19,621
MARISHA: (sighs)

480
00:34:19,621 --> 00:34:23,822
TALIESIN: Honestly, we should have assumed that
they could hear all of our plans from the

481
00:34:23,822 --> 00:34:24,990
beginning.

482
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,605
LAURA: Yes.

483
00:34:26,605 --> 00:34:33,891
TALIESIN: (sighs) My fault, really. Well, we are
very good at being spied on.

484
00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:37,059
SAM: Yes, well, we like to talk.

485
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:43,597
TALIESIN: And even if we do, even if we were to
get rid of her, there's no sense in believing that

486
00:34:43,597 --> 00:34:46,420
they still don't know everything we're doing.

487
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:54,234
SAM: All right. Then we'll see what <i>he</i> proposes
and take it from there.

488
00:34:54,234 --> 00:34:58,088
TALIESIN: And let's hope that we're downstairs,
and if we're not downstairs, there's still

489
00:34:58,088 --> 00:34:59,551
options.

490
00:34:59,551 --> 00:35:00,801
LAURA: All right.

491
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:03,742
MATT: Grog, you've finally caught up with the
group. You've managed to drop off your large

492
00:35:03,742 --> 00:35:05,681
amount of dragon hide in return.

493
00:35:05,681 --> 00:35:12,218
TRAVIS: Holy shit, that skin weighs a ton. Good
thing I'm strong as fuck. What'd I miss?

494
00:35:12,218 --> 00:35:18,257
SAM: Is there a cold place in the treasure room?
Wait, this hide is going to be cured, or smoked,

495
00:35:18,257 --> 00:35:20,604
or something, whatever you do. Stretched?

496
00:35:20,604 --> 00:35:23,847
LAURA: It's got scales all over it. I mean that
stays, right? It doesn't have to be kept cold?

497
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:25,864
MATT: I mean, it probably should be.

498
00:35:25,864 --> 00:35:27,101
LAURA: Kept cold.

499
00:35:27,101 --> 00:35:31,757
MATT: It probably should be attended to in a short
amount of time, like in the next week or so,

500
00:35:31,757 --> 00:35:32,866
before it's really--

501
00:35:32,866 --> 00:35:36,898
LAURA: Would it be an armorer, or a blacksmith,
or-- who works with dragonhide?

502
00:35:36,898 --> 00:35:40,411
SAM: Taliesin, what's the old fashioned word for
the guy who does the hide stuff?

503
00:35:40,411 --> 00:35:41,523
LIAM: Tanner.

504
00:35:41,523 --> 00:35:43,078
SAM: A tanner! Thank you!

505
00:35:43,078 --> 00:35:45,091
LAURA: Is there a tanner in Whitestone?

506
00:35:45,091 --> 00:35:47,584
TALIESIN: One would assume we have a tanner in
Whitestone.

507
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,954
MATT: There are a few tanners, yeah.

508
00:35:48,954 --> 00:35:51,745
TRAVIS: Is it super cold where I dropped off the
hide? Like is it below ground?

509
00:35:51,745 --> 00:35:53,655
MATT: It's below ground. Yeah, it's not--

510
00:35:53,655 --> 00:35:54,897
TRAVIS: A bit chilly?

511
00:35:54,897 --> 00:35:58,210
MATT: Comparatively. Whitestone in general is a
pretty chilly place, so yeah.

512
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:03,319
SAM: But not like a fake-bake. We want a real
tanner, right?

513
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:07,131
LIAM: Hey, while they're talking about all this,
can I stealth away?

514
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:09,209
MATT: Yes, you can. Make a stealth check.

515
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:14,616
LIAM: I'll use Luck. 28.

516
00:36:14,616 --> 00:36:15,855
MATT: What was that?

517
00:36:15,855 --> 00:36:16,939
LIAM: 28.

518
00:36:16,939 --> 00:36:20,387
MATT: 28. Okay, yeah. You vanish without anybody
else noticing your disappearance.

519
00:36:20,443 --> 00:36:23,096
LIAM: I would like to go as quickly as I can
towards Gilmore's house.

520
00:36:23,096 --> 00:36:24,721
MATT: Okay.

521
00:36:24,721 --> 00:36:26,575
LAURA: He's cheating on you, Keyleth.

522
00:36:26,575 --> 00:36:30,070
MARISHA: (laughs) Look, it's 2016.

523
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:33,130
TRAVIS: Did we decide what we do about
Raish--?

524
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:35,741
LAURA: (shushing)

525
00:36:35,741 --> 00:36:36,947
TALIESIN: Seeker Asum?

526
00:36:36,947 --> 00:36:37,909
TRAVIS: Yeah.

527
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:39,768
TALIESIN: We're going to talk, we're going to
listen, and we're going to be prepared for

528
00:36:39,768 --> 00:36:40,749
anything.

529
00:36:40,749 --> 00:36:42,331
TRAVIS: Okay, so we're not (death noises and
farts)?

530
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:43,734
LAURA: Not just yet.

531
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:46,940
TALIESIN: We're going to talk, we're going to
listen, and be prepared for anything.

532
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,113
SAM: Was that last sound the sound of Seeker
Asum's bowels?

533
00:36:50,113 --> 00:36:51,998
TRAVIS: It's open to interpretation.

534
00:36:51,998 --> 00:36:57,550
SAM: Okay. After he dies, letting it all out?

535
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:02,205
TRAVIS: Yeah. Just want to be fancy. I lean that
way but, you know. Cannot speak for other people.

536
00:37:02,205 --> 00:37:05,277
TALIESIN: The work speaks for itself, really.

537
00:37:05,277 --> 00:37:11,306
MATT: Fair enough. Vax, as you rush down towards
the homestead that Gilmore had made here in

538
00:37:11,306 --> 00:37:16,587
Whitestone, the door is closed. There's a large
pile out front of ruined furniture that's been

539
00:37:16,587 --> 00:37:22,634
jammed into this collection. Presumably from the
last encounter they had when the incursion of

540
00:37:22,634 --> 00:37:26,824
assassins made their way in. But the door's
closed, and seemingly locked.

541
00:37:26,824 --> 00:37:28,678
LIAM: (knocks)

542
00:37:28,678 --> 00:37:31,891
MATT: A few moments pass, no response.

543
00:37:31,891 --> 00:37:33,580
(Mario coin sound)

544
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,807
LIAM: That's him, that's magic!

545
00:37:35,807 --> 00:37:37,767
MATT: But you find a cool coin.

546
00:37:37,767 --> 00:37:39,655
LIAM: (knocks)

547
00:37:39,655 --> 00:37:44,609
MATT: Yeah. Eventually you hear a little rustling,
and you hear a voice, muffled, from the upper

548
00:37:44,609 --> 00:37:47,789
floor say, "Confound it, I'll be right down!"

549
00:37:47,789 --> 00:37:50,843
LIAM: I'm so scared of this with that hair on your
head.

550
00:37:50,843 --> 00:37:52,342
LAURA: Yeah.

551
00:37:52,342 --> 00:37:56,569
MATT: You hear some footsteps, and then eventually
the door (unlocking sound). You hear the unlocking

552
00:37:56,569 --> 00:38:02,635
mechanism. The door swings open a little bit. And
you see, you know, morning robe, chest open, curly

553
00:38:02,635 --> 00:38:12,309
chest hair poking out. A very groggy bedhead.
Gilmore opens the door. "Yes, can I help-- Oh.

554
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:13,847
"Good morning."

555
00:38:13,847 --> 00:38:16,563
(laughter)

556
00:38:16,563 --> 00:38:17,823
TRAVIS: I don't know what to do.

557
00:38:17,823 --> 00:38:19,526
LIAM: Why did I do this? Tonight?

558
00:38:19,526 --> 00:38:21,162
MARISHA: Now you know why.

559
00:38:21,162 --> 00:38:28,358
LIAM: Hey, this is not fair. Can I come in to
talk? Quickly, I have to head back to the others.

560
00:38:28,358 --> 00:38:30,681
MATT: "Of course. Would you like some tea?"

561
00:38:30,681 --> 00:38:34,417
LIAM: No. I don't even have time, I just want to
talk to you.

562
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:37,048
MATT: "I'd like some tea. Come on in, come on
in."

563
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,303
LIAM: All right.

564
00:38:38,303 --> 00:38:44,056
MATT: He ushers you to enter, and leads you to one
of the small chairs. And he walks back into the

565
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:50,610
kitchen, shouting over his shoulder, "So!
Vax'ildan, please. Tell me what's on your mind."

566
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:56,168
LIAM: You know, we're getting closer to the end
game here.

567
00:38:56,168 --> 00:39:01,484
MATT: (laughs) "I certainly hope so. It's taken a
couple years off my lifespan."

568
00:39:01,484 --> 00:39:04,605
LIAM: We just killed another one of the dragons.

569
00:39:04,605 --> 00:39:06,340
MATT: "Really?!"

570
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,810
LIAM: Yeah.

571
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:10,535
MATT: "How many is that for you now? Three?"

572
00:39:10,535 --> 00:39:12,412
LIAM: It is three.

573
00:39:12,412 --> 00:39:20,053
MATT: "Making a name for yourself. I'm proud of
you." A few moments pass, and silence. And Gilmore

574
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:26,392
walks back out, clutching a small tray with a few
teacups. And as he's walking, he's twirling his

575
00:39:26,392 --> 00:39:31,212
finger and you can see a little spiral of flame
encircling the tea kettle as it begins to heat up.

576
00:39:31,212 --> 00:39:36,182
He brings it over, sets it down on the table.
Pulls his robe in and sits down across from you on

577
00:39:36,182 --> 00:39:46,390
this low slung tea table. Takes a bit and sips it.
"So, what brings you here this early in the

578
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:48,334
"morning, friend?"

579
00:39:48,334 --> 00:40:11,374
LIAM: I think I might be dead in a couple of days.
So I came here to apologize. If you think I have

580
00:40:11,374 --> 00:40:18,867
no feelings for you, you're kidding yourself. I
care for you very deeply. I have for a long time.

581
00:40:18,867 --> 00:40:40,560
And I don't think I've treated you fairly. But I
wasn't playing games. Shaun. It's been a little

582
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:47,495
weird lately, and I understand why, but I want you
to know that I love you as a dear, dear friend,

583
00:40:47,495 --> 00:40:53,578
and I really don't think I'm going to be here in a
few days. And I would hate to think that I would be--

584
00:40:53,578 --> 00:41:01,189
MATT: "Shh. That's far too fatalistic for the
Vax'ildan that I-- number one. Number two, you

585
00:41:01,189 --> 00:41:09,848
"have nothing to apologize for. Look, everything's
on fire around us all the time. We all jump at

586
00:41:09,848 --> 00:41:24,380
"whatever bit of comfort finds its way before us.
And at the same time, I appreciate your honesty.

587
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:35,405
"And I'm thankful for the connection that we do
have. And yes, heartbreak comes. But heartbreak

588
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:42,460
"goes. It's part of life. It just means that I need
to find somebody who's a little more my speed."

589
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,154
LIAM: That guy'll be fast.

590
00:41:45,154 --> 00:41:55,588
MATT: "He better be. Don't worry about it. Go.
Kill a dragon. Another. Kill two more. Kill six

591
00:41:55,588 --> 00:42:02,065
"more, I don't care! Just know that you're coming
back, because I need you and your friends to keep

592
00:42:02,065 --> 00:42:04,528
"pimping out my name."

593
00:42:04,528 --> 00:42:13,598
LIAM: Sure. Whoever gets you will be a very lucky
man.

594
00:42:13,598 --> 00:42:19,210
MATT: "I know. I know."

595
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:26,640
LIAM: Love you.

596
00:42:26,779 --> 00:42:30,053
MATT: "I know. You sure you don't want any tea?"

597
00:42:30,053 --> 00:42:36,010
LIAM: I'm really nauseous right now. I almost
didn't come here.

598
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:46,823
MATT: "I'm glad you did." He takes your cup.
"Waste not, want not. (sips) Now go! Stop being

599
00:42:46,823 --> 00:42:48,546
"uncomfortable in front of me! I need to get my
morning--"

600
00:42:48,546 --> 00:42:49,476
LIAM: Yeah. Yes.

601
00:42:49,476 --> 00:42:51,676
MATT: "--situated."

602
00:42:51,676 --> 00:42:53,661
LIAM: Goodbye.

603
00:42:53,661 --> 00:43:03,571
MATT: He stands there. Waves his hand and the door
opens on its own.

604
00:43:03,571 --> 00:43:07,351
LIAM: I leave.

605
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:10,285
MATT: He takes you by the shoulder real fast
before you leave, and turns around and goes,

606
00:43:10,285 --> 00:43:20,653
"'Till next time. Say it."

607
00:43:20,653 --> 00:43:24,050
LIAM: 'Till next time.

608
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:33,235
MATT: "All right. Go." And you feel a little
pat on your backside, on the way out. He

609
00:43:33,289 --> 00:43:40,664
sits there holding his tea, watching you leave.
Door slams behind you. You make your way back.

610
00:43:40,664 --> 00:43:44,153
LIAM: I'm sorry I made you do that in that
skullcap, Matt.

611
00:43:44,153 --> 00:43:47,883
MATT: Look, I don't have to look at this. I'm
fine!

612
00:43:47,883 --> 00:43:50,112
(laughter)

613
00:43:50,112 --> 00:43:52,354
MATT: From my perspective, this is easy.

614
00:43:52,354 --> 00:43:54,392
LIAM: All I saw was a very handsome man.

615
00:43:54,392 --> 00:43:55,720
(laughter)

616
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,238
TRAVIS: Training. This is all training. It's
training at a thousand times gravity.

617
00:43:58,238 --> 00:44:02,454
MATT: (laughs) It totally is! Like performing arts
with the weights on.

618
00:44:02,454 --> 00:44:04,995
LIAM: Been doing this since the 80s and 90s, man.

619
00:44:04,995 --> 00:44:11,218
LAURA: We need to find Kashaw. Before the meeting,
yes?

620
00:44:11,218 --> 00:44:14,040
MARISHA: Yeah, I set off. To find Kashaw with
Vex.

621
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:18,938
MATT: All right. Asking around quickly, he is back
in the room where he's been staying in Whitestone.

622
00:44:18,938 --> 00:44:22,366
You go back to his door. It's closed.

623
00:44:22,366 --> 00:44:25,698
MARISHA: (knocks)

624
00:44:25,698 --> 00:44:26,935
LAURA: Kash?

625
00:44:26,935 --> 00:44:28,637
MATT: Nothing.

626
00:44:28,637 --> 00:44:30,557
LAURA: (loudly) Are you sleeping?

627
00:44:30,557 --> 00:44:32,394
MATT: Nothing.

628
00:44:32,394 --> 00:44:35,045
SAM: Break down the door.

629
00:44:35,045 --> 00:44:36,364
MARISHA: Kash?

630
00:44:36,364 --> 00:44:38,079
LAURA: I'm going to jiggle the lock. Is it
locked?

631
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,282
MATT: It's not locked.

632
00:44:39,282 --> 00:44:40,986
LAURA: I open it. Just a crack, and look in.

633
00:44:40,986 --> 00:44:42,451
MARISHA: I hope you're not naked!

634
00:44:42,451 --> 00:44:43,659
LAURA: Shh.

635
00:44:43,659 --> 00:44:47,976
MATT: As you open it up, there's no light on the
inside, but the light does come in as you slowly

636
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:54,417
open the door with a (squeaks). You can see he's
halfway out of his armor, passed out on his back,

637
00:44:54,417 --> 00:45:04,596
on the bed. He's one arm out, snoring loudly like
he was too tired to make it all the way, and (snores).

638
00:45:04,596 --> 00:45:06,331
LAURA: Should we let him sleep or should we talk
to him?

639
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:08,005
MARISHA: I don't know.

640
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:08,968
LAURA: He snores.

641
00:45:08,968 --> 00:45:09,858
MARISHA: Wow.

642
00:45:09,858 --> 00:45:12,993
LAURA: You know, my brother doesn't snore.

643
00:45:12,993 --> 00:45:14,306
MARISHA: No, I know.

644
00:45:14,306 --> 00:45:15,245
TRAVIS: Ew.

645
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:16,121
MARISHA: No, I mean I don't--

646
00:45:16,121 --> 00:45:17,318
LAURA: No, just don't, just don't.

647
00:45:17,318 --> 00:45:18,522
MARISHA: Just don't worry about it.

648
00:45:18,522 --> 00:45:20,478
(laughter)

649
00:45:20,478 --> 00:45:22,342
TALIESIN: I love you, Travis.

650
00:45:22,342 --> 00:45:24,783
LIAM: You thought I'd be the one to fuck up.

651
00:45:24,783 --> 00:45:26,511
(laughter)

652
00:45:26,511 --> 00:45:30,131
LAURA: Do I have any like stones or any like rocks or
anything in my bag or--

653
00:45:30,131 --> 00:45:31,858
MARISHA: You're going to throw a rock at him?

654
00:45:31,858 --> 00:45:33,231
LAURA: Yeah, just to see if he wakes up.

655
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,941
MARISHA: We can't just poke him? That seems so
weird, though.

656
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,510
SAM: You're an archer.

657
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:39,922
LAURA: Well, I don't want to kill him.

658
00:45:39,922 --> 00:45:43,684
MARISHA: Why don't we just tap on his shoulder?

659
00:45:43,684 --> 00:45:47,639
LAURA: I'll sneak in, tap his shoulder, come back
out, see if he wakes up.

660
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:49,677
MARISHA: Oh, that's what I want to do.

661
00:45:49,677 --> 00:45:51,085
LAURA: I don't want him to know that, you know--

662
00:45:51,085 --> 00:45:54,679
MARISHA: That we did that? Sure. I'll stand on the
outside and look unsuspecting.

663
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:58,091
LAURA: I want to sneak in and tickle his little
foot and walk out.

664
00:45:58,091 --> 00:46:00,404
MATT: Well, he still has his boots on.

665
00:46:00,404 --> 00:46:01,273
LAURA: Shit.

666
00:46:01,273 --> 00:46:03,293
MATT: It's more like his upper torso, he got
partway out of that.

667
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:07,295
LAURA: All right, I tickle his hands.

668
00:46:07,295 --> 00:46:09,844
MATT: Okay so you're opening his palm--

669
00:46:09,844 --> 00:46:11,715
LAURA: Tickle his hands and then go back really
fast to the doorway.

670
00:46:11,715 --> 00:46:15,238
MATT: Okay, you tickle his hand. No response.

671
00:46:15,238 --> 00:46:16,303
LAURA: Fucking--

672
00:46:16,303 --> 00:46:18,022
MATT: (snores)

673
00:46:18,022 --> 00:46:19,773
LAURA: I flick his nose.

674
00:46:19,773 --> 00:46:24,521
MATT: As soon as you flick his nose and you start
to back away, there's a blur of motion as suddenly

675
00:46:24,521 --> 00:46:30,422
he comes leaping out of the bed (grunts) and goes
over and grabs his spear, his hand reaches for

676
00:46:30,422 --> 00:46:36,041
nothing in the air, and slings it forward in your
direction, (whoosh) bypassing by your face by a

677
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:41,459
few inches. And he looks still half awake, going
(startled noises).

678
00:46:41,459 --> 00:46:47,219
MARISHA: Oh Kash, oh hi. Fancy meeting you here.
Shit.

679
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:48,672
MATT: "Yeah, it's my room."

680
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:49,626
MARISHA: I keep doing that.

681
00:46:49,626 --> 00:46:51,470
LAURA: I know; it's awkward.

682
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:53,878
LAURA and MARISHA: Hi.

683
00:46:53,878 --> 00:46:56,112
MATT: "Hi." And he throws his spear to the side.

684
00:46:56,112 --> 00:46:57,660
LAURA: Oh good, I was wondering if--

685
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,730
MARISHA: Yeah, I hope we didn't-- I hope you
weren't sleeping.

686
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:09,707
MATT: "I hope I wasn't either. Sure, all right,
I'm glad you're here because it took me a long-ass

687
00:47:09,707 --> 00:47:16,141
"time to get here." And he sits up in the bed and--
or he sits down back on the bed and reaches over

688
00:47:16,141 --> 00:47:21,342
and pulls out one of his packs and brings out a
couple of rolls of paper. "Okay, so I talked to

689
00:47:21,342 --> 00:47:24,884
"Vanessa and got two contracts that we could take
up for this."

690
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:25,847
LAURA: Okay.

691
00:47:25,847 --> 00:47:29,494
MATT: "We got one here," and he pulls it out,
"This is for two indigenous creatures to the

692
00:47:29,494 --> 00:47:34,991
"region that you were talking about over by
Wildemount. One is a purple worm matron."

693
00:47:34,991 --> 00:47:36,765
LAURA: Ooh, that sounds big.

694
00:47:36,765 --> 00:47:44,685
MATT: "Supposedly. Shit's dangerous. Careful. This
one is for a Storm Giant. This one is a little

695
00:47:44,685 --> 00:47:46,318
"harder to get a hold of apparently."

696
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:51,022
LAURA: They're so hard to get a hold of. We should
probably focus on the other one.

697
00:47:51,022 --> 00:47:52,355
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

698
00:47:52,355 --> 00:47:55,147
LAURA: Unless Vorugal's already dead.

699
00:47:55,147 --> 00:47:58,834
MARISHA: Yeah, wouldn't that be crazy if he was
already dead?

700
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:02,106
LAURA: What would we do with these contracts if he
is? Just wondering about that.

701
00:48:02,106 --> 00:48:06,127
MATT: "Get out of my room."

702
00:48:06,127 --> 00:48:07,048
MARISHA: Kash.

703
00:48:07,048 --> 00:48:07,842
MATT: "Just get out."

704
00:48:07,842 --> 00:48:08,529
MARISHA: Kash.

705
00:48:08,529 --> 00:48:09,579
MATT: "Get out of my room."

706
00:48:09,579 --> 00:48:10,649
MARISHA: Look--

707
00:48:10,649 --> 00:48:12,029
LAURA: Your help has been--

708
00:48:12,029 --> 00:48:14,063
MARISHA: Not overlooked.

709
00:48:14,063 --> 00:48:16,847
MATT: "Out. Of my room."

710
00:48:16,847 --> 00:48:18,404
LAURA and MARISHA: We should probably go.

711
00:48:18,404 --> 00:48:19,198
LAURA: Do you want these back--

712
00:48:19,198 --> 00:48:20,233
MATT: "Out of my room."

713
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:21,063
LAURA: I'm going to set them down on the ground.

714
00:48:21,063 --> 00:48:22,130
MATT: "Out of my room."

715
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:22,920
MARISHA: You know, we could--

716
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,228
MATT: "Get out of my room."

717
00:48:24,228 --> 00:48:28,634
LAURA: By the way, you might want to get like a
mouthguard or something because you snore a little.

718
00:48:28,634 --> 00:48:38,293
MATT: You leave him in silence and darkness.
(yelling) "Out of my room!"

719
00:48:38,293 --> 00:48:40,904
LAURA: Keyleth, we should go.

720
00:48:40,904 --> 00:48:44,931
MARISHA: Okay. Okay. We'll see you later.

721
00:48:44,931 --> 00:48:46,596
LAURA: Keyleth.

722
00:48:46,596 --> 00:48:47,708
MARISHA: What?

723
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:49,456
LAURA: Come here.

724
00:48:49,456 --> 00:48:50,431
MARISHA: Okay.

725
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:55,671
LAURA: And I take her around a corner. He kissed
me.

726
00:48:55,671 --> 00:48:57,755
MARISHA: Kash?

727
00:48:57,755 --> 00:48:59,595
LAURA: No! God no! Percy!

728
00:48:59,595 --> 00:49:00,580
MARISHA: Like right now?

729
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,583
LAURA: Percival!

730
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:02,492
MARISHA: Did I miss something?

731
00:49:02,492 --> 00:49:03,290
LAURA: No.

732
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:04,300
MARISHA: What? Percy?

733
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,077
LAURA: Yeah!

734
00:49:05,077 --> 00:49:06,025
MARISHA: (squeals)

735
00:49:06,025 --> 00:49:07,025
LAURA: I know.

736
00:49:07,025 --> 00:49:08,980
MARISHA: That's good, right?

737
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,111
LAURA: I mean I know you guys are like--

738
00:49:10,111 --> 00:49:10,964
MARISHA: No!

739
00:49:10,964 --> 00:49:13,207
LAURA: Pretty close and I don't know if that's
weird.

740
00:49:13,207 --> 00:49:14,262
MARISHA: Why are you asking me?

741
00:49:14,262 --> 00:49:15,760
LAURA: I don't know, you're like his sister, kind
of.

742
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,836
MARISHA: He's not my twin brother.

743
00:49:16,836 --> 00:49:28,146
LAURA: This is true. How are things with you and
Vax? Thanks for bringing it up. Is it good?

744
00:49:28,146 --> 00:49:31,726
MARISHA: I still worry if you care.

745
00:49:31,726 --> 00:49:33,482
LAURA: I care; of course I care.

746
00:49:33,482 --> 00:49:35,049
MARISHA: Yeah, you say that.

747
00:49:35,049 --> 00:49:42,340
LAURA: I hug her. Well not your antlers in my
face.

748
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:47,234
MARISHA: Oh, sorry, sorry, that happens a lot. I'm
very happy for you.

749
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:50,620
LAURA: Hey thanks. We should go look at the
treasury.

750
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:54,259
MARISHA: Okay, let's go to the treasury. We should
go victory shopping.

751
00:49:54,259 --> 00:49:55,424
LAURA: Oh my god.

752
00:49:55,424 --> 00:49:56,322
MARISHA: Yeah.

753
00:49:56,322 --> 00:50:00,751
LAURA: Do you think he'd mind if we-- I mean we
have so much money, we don't even need to do that.

754
00:50:00,751 --> 00:50:04,013
MARISHA: I mean it's basically our money, though,
right?

755
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:05,331
LAURA: Yeah. No. It's--

756
00:50:05,331 --> 00:50:06,985
MARISHA: Yeah. Okay.

757
00:50:06,985 --> 00:50:11,031
MATT: All right, so you guys wander your way
off--

758
00:50:11,031 --> 00:50:15,063
MARISHA: You know, Vex, I feel like you might be a
bad or good influence on me. I'm not sure, but I

759
00:50:15,063 --> 00:50:16,385
like it.

760
00:50:16,385 --> 00:50:17,419
LAURA: It's all good.

761
00:50:17,419 --> 00:50:18,274
MARISHA: Okay.

762
00:50:18,274 --> 00:50:19,653
MATT: Scanlan, Grog, Percival. What are you guys
doing?

763
00:50:19,653 --> 00:50:21,521
TALIESIN: Life is failing the Bechdel Test so hard
right now.

764
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:23,195
MARISHA: Yeah.

765
00:50:23,195 --> 00:50:24,227
LAURA: So bad.

766
00:50:24,227 --> 00:50:26,088
TALIESIN: Sorry. (laughs) Carry on.

767
00:50:26,088 --> 00:50:29,724
LAURA: Sometimes they do talk about boys.

768
00:50:29,724 --> 00:50:34,807
MARISHA: They are like 50% of--

769
00:50:34,807 --> 00:50:37,515
TALIESIN: No, I did not see that coming.

770
00:50:37,515 --> 00:50:41,492
TRAVIS: We don't really need to like check in with
anything.

771
00:50:41,492 --> 00:50:45,581
SAM: You mean do you have the gold?

772
00:50:45,581 --> 00:50:47,856
TRAVIS: Well I mean I-- yeah.

773
00:50:47,856 --> 00:50:49,698
SAM: We should probably divvy it up, don't you
think?

774
00:50:49,698 --> 00:50:51,126
TRAVIS: What? What? What?

775
00:50:51,126 --> 00:50:52,130
TALIESIN: No, no, no.

776
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:54,970
TRAVIS: But it's really a lot to hold onto your
person. I mean, it's a bag of gold--

777
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:56,648
SAM: No, but we should all replenish our
personal--

778
00:50:56,648 --> 00:50:58,402
TALIESIN: You can have some pocket money, but--

779
00:50:58,402 --> 00:50:59,346
SAM: Yes, yes, yes.

780
00:50:59,346 --> 00:51:00,968
TRAVIS: Yeah. How much do you want? You don't have
it. I have it.

781
00:51:00,968 --> 00:51:03,254
SAM: 5000. We have hundreds.

782
00:51:03,254 --> 00:51:06,440
TRAVIS: Yeah, if you want 5000. Do you have good
credit?

783
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,904
SAM: Do I have good credit?

784
00:51:07,904 --> 00:51:08,777
TRAVIS: Yeah.

785
00:51:08,777 --> 00:51:11,237
SAM: I've never misspent a single coin.

786
00:51:11,237 --> 00:51:13,238
TRAVIS: Can I have your last four pay stubs,
please?

787
00:51:13,238 --> 00:51:15,608
(laughter)

788
00:51:15,608 --> 00:51:17,175
SAM: Here's two of them right here.

789
00:51:17,175 --> 00:51:20,100
TRAVIS: Hey! That's good enough! Have 5000 gold!

790
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:24,976
MATT: As Grog gives you 5000 gold, which weighs
roughly a hundred pounds--

791
00:51:24,976 --> 00:51:25,778
SAM: Shit!

792
00:51:25,778 --> 00:51:27,226
MATT: It weighs more than you do.

793
00:51:27,226 --> 00:51:29,196
LAURA: 5000 gold is a hundred pounds?

794
00:51:29,196 --> 00:51:30,753
TRAVIS: And it's probably about 1000 because I
can't count to 5000.

795
00:51:30,753 --> 00:51:34,798
MATT: Yeah. He starts divvying it out until it's
like larger than you in a pile in the center of

796
00:51:34,798 --> 00:51:35,797
the room.

797
00:51:35,797 --> 00:51:37,112
TALIESIN: Well what are you going to do with it?

798
00:51:37,112 --> 00:51:38,513
SAM: All right, all right. I'm going to give some
back.

799
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:39,379
TRAVIS: Are you really?

800
00:51:39,379 --> 00:51:40,891
SAM: Why don't you give me ten platinum.

801
00:51:40,891 --> 00:51:42,221
TALIESIN: No! Absolutely--

802
00:51:42,221 --> 00:51:44,064
SAM: (chuckles) It's the same! It's the same!

803
00:51:44,064 --> 00:51:45,059
TRAVIS: Why not?

804
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:46,098
LIAM: Ten platinum?

805
00:51:46,098 --> 00:51:47,957
TALIESIN: Ten platinum is an awful lot.

806
00:51:47,957 --> 00:51:49,496
TRAVIS: But he can carry ten. That's easier.

807
00:51:49,496 --> 00:51:50,506
LIAM: Sure.

808
00:51:50,506 --> 00:51:52,590
TRAVIS: Hold on, let me consult Blackstone.

809
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:54,274
LIAM: Ten or ten thousand?

810
00:51:54,274 --> 00:51:56,266
TALIESIN: (stage whisper) Don't do it!

811
00:51:56,266 --> 00:51:59,391
TRAVIS: Yep. Stoneblack says it's all right.

812
00:51:59,391 --> 00:52:01,461
SAM: You're with us. You're with us.

813
00:52:01,461 --> 00:52:02,362
TALIESIN: I am!

814
00:52:02,362 --> 00:52:03,743
TRAVIS: I take the gold. I put it back in.

815
00:52:03,743 --> 00:52:04,486
TALIESIN: No!

816
00:52:04,486 --> 00:52:06,166
TRAVIS: And I give him ten platinum, which is
actually six.

817
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:09,336
MATT: So you get six platinum from Grog, which is
roughly sixty gold.

818
00:52:09,336 --> 00:52:12,634
TRAVIS: One. Three. Seven. Eight. Nine. 40. Ten.

819
00:52:12,634 --> 00:52:14,300
SAM: That's it?

820
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,212
TRAVIS: Yep.

821
00:52:15,212 --> 00:52:16,186
TALIESIN: Excellent.

822
00:52:16,186 --> 00:52:17,677
SAM: And give me 500 gold, as well.

823
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:18,595
TALIESIN: No!

824
00:52:18,595 --> 00:52:19,717
SAM: Of course. I need money.

825
00:52:19,717 --> 00:52:22,463
TRAVIS: It's really heavy. How about I give you 20
more platinum?

826
00:52:22,463 --> 00:52:24,044
SAM: Great. That sounds good.

827
00:52:24,044 --> 00:52:25,299
TRAVIS: And I give him four more.

828
00:52:25,299 --> 00:52:27,581
SAM: (laughs) Give me 50 more platinum.

829
00:52:27,581 --> 00:52:29,245
TRAVIS: 50?

830
00:52:29,245 --> 00:52:30,064
SAM: Yes.

831
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:31,073
TRAVIS: All right. I give you one more.

832
00:52:31,073 --> 00:52:34,516
SAM: Thank you. 11 platinum.

833
00:52:34,516 --> 00:52:36,696
MATT: Perfect.

834
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:41,361
TALIESIN: I'm going to try to find Allura. I'm
going to leave them to their madness. I'm going to

835
00:52:41,361 --> 00:52:46,730
try and find Allura and Cassandra or anybody I can
find in the castle at this point.

836
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:52,794
MATT: Okay. As you walk around, nobody else who's
supposed to be meeting has gathered yet. However,

837
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:58,468
Cassandra is awake and in the process of going
through some papers. She has her personal guard at

838
00:52:58,468 --> 00:53:03,318
her side and two guards at the door and you can
see she's getting herself prepared for the

839
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:08,126
meeting. As you enter the room, the door partially
ajar, you see her still down currently thumbing

840
00:53:08,126 --> 00:53:13,100
through notes. Her hair is still in disarray and
pulled back haphazardly. And she's wearing her

841
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:20,654
morning gown and without even looking up goes,
"Percival. Glad you've arrived and still in one piece."

842
00:53:20,654 --> 00:53:23,110
TALIESIN: Yes. And down one dragon.

843
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:28,805
MATT: "I have to tell you, I'm very impressed."

844
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:37,538
TALIESIN: Thank you. Two more to go. It's going to
get a little heavier at this point.

845
00:53:37,538 --> 00:53:42,338
MATT: "Indeed. That's what our meeting is about."

846
00:53:42,338 --> 00:53:44,756
IPHONE: What was that, again?

847
00:53:44,756 --> 00:53:46,755
TALIESIN: What was that, again?

848
00:53:46,755 --> 00:53:52,749
MATT: "Sorry, I need to go fire some of my guards.
They're making a nuisance. Continue, please."

849
00:53:52,749 --> 00:54:00,165
TALIESIN: Two more to go. I fear that it's
possible that Whitestone itself may eventually be

850
00:54:00,165 --> 00:54:03,574
a target of an attack. I feel it may be
inevitable.

851
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:08,687
MATT: "That is, actually, what our meeting is
about. Prevent that from happening."

852
00:54:08,687 --> 00:54:16,667
TALIESIN: Quickly to check. I would know what
languages Cassandra spoke, correct?

853
00:54:16,667 --> 00:54:19,918
MATT: What languages do you know?

854
00:54:19,918 --> 00:54:21,529
TALIESIN: Elven, Celestial, Common.

855
00:54:21,529 --> 00:54:23,176
MATT: She knows Elven and Common. She does not
know Celestial.

856
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:23,959
TALIESIN: Okay.

857
00:54:23,959 --> 00:54:24,898
MATT: That was more your hobby.

858
00:54:24,898 --> 00:54:27,166
TALIESIN: I figured. That was my guess. I wanted
to confirm.

859
00:54:27,166 --> 00:54:28,187
MATT: Yeah.

860
00:54:28,187 --> 00:54:34,593
TALIESIN: I hand her a small slip of paper that I
have written in Elven: "Be prepared for anything

861
00:54:34,593 --> 00:54:37,871
"today. Keep silent."

862
00:54:37,871 --> 00:54:45,453
MATT: She gives you a very keen look. And you can
see Cassandra. As much as she is the healthiest

863
00:54:45,453 --> 00:54:49,799
you've seen her physically, her eyes have dark
circles over them. It looks like she's been very

864
00:54:49,799 --> 00:54:59,337
harried by the events of these past few weeks.
Understandably so. But she takes and looks over

865
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:04,566
the sheet and goes, "Well, very well. Should be an
interesting meeting then."

866
00:55:04,566 --> 00:55:06,312
TALIESIN: I think so.

867
00:55:06,312 --> 00:55:13,985
I do think so. It's good to see you taking
command.

868
00:55:13,985 --> 00:55:18,019
MATT: "It's good to see you, and I look forward to 
you sharing some of the burden soon."

869
00:55:18,102 --> 00:55:18,876
TALIESIN: Yes.

870
00:55:18,876 --> 00:55:19,849
MATT: "Right?"

871
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:21,601
TALIESIN: Quite possibly.

872
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:23,141
MATT: "Right?"

873
00:55:23,141 --> 00:55:28,526
TALIESIN: We will discuss whence the 
dragons are taken care of.

874
00:55:28,526 --> 00:55:29,668
MATT: "Good."

875
00:55:29,668 --> 00:55:32,963
TALIESIN: We will discuss, at
the very least, relieving you of some of this

876
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:34,535
burden.

877
00:55:34,535 --> 00:55:35,586
MATT: "Good."

878
00:55:35,586 --> 00:55:36,975
TALIESIN: I know it is not fair.

879
00:55:36,975 --> 00:55:41,610
MATT: "Whatever is fair in this life? The
wonders of lordship and ladydom."

880
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:45,456
SAM: I'm going to run off and try to find Jarett.

881
00:55:45,456 --> 00:55:48,959
MATT: Okay. Do you wish to come? Anything 
else you want to bring to this conversation?

882
00:55:48,959 --> 00:55:55,768
TALIESIN: No, I'm fine with that. My last thing is,
I'm going to quickly run and have a quick conversation

883
00:55:55,768 --> 00:56:03,772
privately with-- I assume we have some sort of royal jeweler
of some kind, or somebody who does some of

884
00:56:03,772 --> 00:56:05,001
the ornamental work.

885
00:56:05,001 --> 00:56:08,421
MATT: No one who lives on site per se, but
there are two individuals that your family

886
00:56:08,421 --> 00:56:12,799
generally used for various forms of jewel
craft.

887
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,687
TALIESIN: I'm going to write and send a
letter off for that.

888
00:56:14,687 --> 00:56:17,157
MATT: Okay. No worries. Scanlan, what are you 
going to do? Looking for Jarett?

889
00:56:17,157 --> 00:56:18,487
SAM: Looking for Jarett.

890
00:56:18,487 --> 00:56:22,434
MATT: Okay. You head outside of the main 
castle, down to where the

891
00:56:22,434 --> 00:56:29,572
training barracks are for Whitestone. And you can
see Jarett's already out there, with a small,

892
00:56:29,572 --> 00:56:35,629
metallic platter on his lap, scarfing up some food
real fast. He's gotten his day started relatively

893
00:56:35,629 --> 00:56:40,385
early and as soon as you approach, mouth's already
full. "Mmm! Scanlan! It's good to see you."

894
00:56:40,385 --> 00:56:43,571
SAM: Good to see you too! What're you
enjoying there?

895
00:56:43,571 --> 00:56:48,660
MATT: (laughs) "The usual gruel that you
find in this city."

896
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:52,924
SAM: Oh, I thought it might be something, 
meat-based that you could have popped

897
00:56:52,924 --> 00:56:55,230
up a bit with your spice.

898
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:57,990
MATT: "Oh, well trust me, I've used it on 
the eggs and it makes it

899
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:04,739
"bearable. Whitestone is not well known for its
cuisine from what I can tell. Everything's gray

900
00:57:04,782 --> 00:57:06,521
"and lacks flavor."

901
00:57:06,521 --> 00:57:12,024
SAM: I'll invite you over to my house some 
time, give you a proper chicken dinner.

902
00:57:12,024 --> 00:57:15,157
MATT: "All right, I will happily take you
up on that offer, thank you."

903
00:57:15,157 --> 00:57:18,938
SAM: Wanted to check in on (lowers voice) the
task we talked about?

904
00:57:18,938 --> 00:57:21,426
MATT: "The task?"

905
00:57:21,461 --> 00:57:27,410
SAM: You know, the mission we discussed.

906
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:30,444
MATT: "Remind me again?"

907
00:57:30,444 --> 00:57:41,313
SAM: I don't want to talk about it out in the open.
But you know there was some illicit--

908
00:57:41,313 --> 00:57:42,957
MATT: "Oh!"

909
00:57:42,957 --> 00:57:46,801
SAM: Items of medicine.

910
00:57:46,801 --> 00:57:52,706
MATT: "Yes, I sent a request through
someone I know."

911
00:57:52,706 --> 00:57:56,617
SAM: <i>Sent a request?!</i> You're using other people?
I trust you, I don't trust other people!

912
00:57:56,617 --> 00:58:04,398
MATT: "I'm not going to leave the city right now to
go find-- Look, I have two

913
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,997
"people I know that might be able to get what you
need. But it's going to take time."

914
00:58:06,997 --> 00:58:10,685
SAM: (sighs) I don't have time. (sighs)

915
00:58:10,685 --> 00:58:14,517
MATT: "When did you pick up this habit?!
I'm worried about you now, Scanlan."

916
00:58:14,517 --> 00:58:18,117
SAM: I haven't picked it up. I'm trying to pick it up,
damn it! It's the most difficult

917
00:58:18,117 --> 00:58:24,138
habit to pick up! Listen, can I confide in you,
man to man, one on one, here?

918
00:58:24,138 --> 00:58:25,680
MATT: "Certainly."

919
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:30,777
SAM: You're a fighter, you're a strapping young
battle man, aren't you?

920
00:58:30,777 --> 00:58:33,766
MATT: (chuckles) "I have been told this once or twice,
yes."

921
00:58:33,766 --> 00:58:39,705
SAM: I haven't felt myself recently. You
know, we have these fights and some of them are

922
00:58:39,705 --> 00:58:45,431
pretty epic and there's monsters involved and I'm
usually on my game, but lately I'm feeling a

923
00:58:45,431 --> 00:58:48,410
little off! How do <i>you</i> cope with that?

924
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:55,090
MATT: "Well largely by not using illicit
substances?!"

925
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:56,377
SAM: Don't judge! Don't judge.

926
00:58:56,377 --> 00:58:59,110
MATT: "I'm not judging! I'm worried about
you. Like, if you don't even have a habit, why

927
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:02,104
"would you look for this? The Scanlan I knew, the
one that hired me,

928
00:59:02,104 --> 00:59:06,584
"he knew how to deal with this issue. 
He got <i>laid.</i>"

929
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:09,339
SAM: I don't really do that much anymore.

930
00:59:09,339 --> 00:59:12,163
MATT: "Maybe that's why you're not
feeling up to the task?" (laughs)

931
00:59:12,163 --> 00:59:14,332
SAM: That is a very fair point, Jarett.

932
00:59:14,332 --> 00:59:19,391
MATT: "I'm just saying. Look, and I do not 
mean to talk out of turn." He

933
00:59:19,391 --> 00:59:30,258
sets his meal aside. "But you are a man who
walks, driven by his pelvis. Am I wrong?"

934
00:59:30,258 --> 00:59:32,241
SAM: You're not wrong.

935
00:59:32,241 --> 00:59:41,129
MATT: "Then what happens if the
pelvis goes unused? Grows bashful?"

936
00:59:41,129 --> 00:59:42,635
TRAVIS: Preach.

937
00:59:42,635 --> 00:59:51,714
SAM: Like a fine instrument, it can go
untuned. If you leave a fine violin without

938
00:59:51,714 --> 00:59:59,197
playing it for many years, it could wither and rot
until you need to replace some of the parts. In a

939
00:59:59,197 --> 01:00:07,384
way, the same is true for my member. But the
problem here, Jarett, is that I'm distracted. I'm

940
01:00:07,384 --> 01:00:11,924
distracted by things that haven't ever distracted
me before. I've made a promise to someone to stay

941
01:00:11,924 --> 01:00:21,157
alive. I've never valued my own life before and
when we get into the shit, I'm second-guessing

942
01:00:21,157 --> 01:00:26,423
things. I'm making stupid decisions that I
wouldn't have otherwise made.

943
01:00:26,423 --> 01:00:31,047
MATT: "Because suddenly you have purpose. Because
you have a reason to come back."

944
01:00:31,047 --> 01:00:32,411
SAM: Yes.

945
01:00:32,411 --> 01:00:35,623
MATT: "That's not a bad thing, then."

946
01:00:35,623 --> 01:00:39,127
SAM: I don't know how to harness that kind of
stress.

947
01:00:39,127 --> 01:00:46,627
MATT: "Do you have a keepsake of this reason to
return, this person you made a promise to?"

948
01:00:46,627 --> 01:00:51,685
SAM: Do I have a keepsake? I don't think so.

949
01:00:51,685 --> 01:00:54,027
MATT: "Then you need to get yourself a keepsake!"

950
01:00:54,027 --> 01:01:00,567
SAM: Well she's not around right now to get a
keepsake from.

951
01:01:00,567 --> 01:01:06,959
MATT: "Then something else that reminds you of
her. Something that you can look at in that

952
01:01:06,959 --> 01:01:08,605
"moment when you're not so sure."

953
01:01:08,605 --> 01:01:10,750
SAM: How did you get so wise, Jarett?

954
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:16,016
MATT: "Drink a lot, listen to people talk. There
are none wiser than barkeeps, my friend, and I

955
01:01:16,016 --> 01:01:18,604
"have been friends with many a barkeep."

956
01:01:18,604 --> 01:01:25,543
SAM: These are all good suggestions. But I'm a man
of instinct, and my instincts said I need to

957
01:01:25,543 --> 01:01:33,574
supplement my body with some extra liquid courage.
So if you can please continue to look for me.

958
01:01:33,574 --> 01:01:39,796
MATT: "I will continue searching and providing
what you require."

959
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:43,224
SAM: I've heard that it can help people in moments
of panic and stress.

960
01:01:43,224 --> 01:01:46,484
MATT: "And I've watched it ruin lives near K'Tawl
Swamp!"

961
01:01:46,484 --> 01:01:48,855
SAM: I can handle a lot of things.

962
01:01:48,855 --> 01:01:52,262
MATT: "You are a strange gnome."

963
01:01:52,262 --> 01:01:54,979
SAM: Takes one to know one?

964
01:01:54,979 --> 01:02:02,753
MATT: "Does not work in this circumstance but I
applaud your attempt. It was good. I'll do what I

965
01:02:02,753 --> 01:02:08,102
"can. But don't forget you have more than one
reason to stick around."

966
01:02:08,102 --> 01:02:16,771
SAM: I know. That's what worries me. I'll think
about what you said. Maybe I'll go have a toss,

967
01:02:16,771 --> 01:02:18,830
see if that helps, too.

968
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:20,794
MATT: "Here, tell you what. Come here."

969
01:02:20,794 --> 01:02:28,567
SAM: Yes?

970
01:02:28,567 --> 01:02:36,329
MATT: And he suckerpunches you in the face. You
unexpectedly fall back. You feel the pulsing of

971
01:02:36,329 --> 01:02:42,709
the blood run to your cheek. Your eyesight goes
white for a second. He goes, "See, now you have to

972
01:02:42,709 --> 01:02:44,682
"live to return the favor."

973
01:02:44,682 --> 01:02:51,612
SAM: You! That was clever. I will definitely get
you back.

974
01:02:51,612 --> 01:02:53,576
MATT: "Good. I look forward to it."

975
01:02:53,576 --> 01:02:55,200
SAM: Watch your back.

976
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,952
MATT: "I always do."

977
01:02:56,952 --> 01:02:59,406
SAM: Get me some drugs!

978
01:02:59,406 --> 01:03:09,474
MATT: Awesome. Grog.

979
01:03:09,474 --> 01:03:12,166
TRAVIS: It's daytime, right?

980
01:03:12,166 --> 01:03:14,310
MATT: Yeah, it's early morning.

981
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:21,106
TRAVIS: Is there a way I can find a courtyard or
an open-air area?

982
01:03:21,106 --> 01:03:25,278
MATT: There are a couple of courtyards within the
perimeter walls of the castle. They have some

983
01:03:25,278 --> 01:03:26,860
small garden elements.

984
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:29,829
TRAVIS: If I get there, are there a lot of guards
keeping an eye?

985
01:03:29,829 --> 01:03:32,780
MATT: Not within the courtyard, no. Occasionally,
there'll be one patrolling.

986
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:35,482
TRAVIS: Can I pee in the courtyard?

987
01:03:35,482 --> 01:03:37,724
MATT: By all means!

988
01:03:37,724 --> 01:03:43,291
TRAVIS: I feel like I need to mark my territory.
This is home for us, and I peed all over Greyskull

989
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:49,536
Keep. I left little puddles that y'all didn't know
about. It's real important in case other goliaths

990
01:03:49,536 --> 01:03:54,084
come around and are like, (sniff) "Nope, the
wolf's here. I got to go elsewhere."

991
01:03:54,084 --> 01:03:56,881
TALIESIN: I assumed it was shoddy masonry and
everything was leaking.

992
01:03:56,881 --> 01:04:01,264
TRAVIS: No, stealth roll, motherfucker. Can I take
a leak on a wall in the courtyard?

993
01:04:01,264 --> 01:04:05,329
MATT: Yeah and there are a number of walls to
choose from: varying heights, different levels of

994
01:04:05,329 --> 01:04:08,435
masonry. You have the veritable pick of the
litter.

995
01:04:08,435 --> 01:04:18,683
TRAVIS: Can I find the highest wall with the most
ornate decoration on it and go slightly off left?

996
01:04:18,683 --> 01:04:26,721
The way me member goes and make a little box right
there? A little waterfall on the whitestone.

997
01:04:26,721 --> 01:04:32,673
MATT: Certainly. You find the portion where the
exterior wall has one little parapet-joining

998
01:04:32,673 --> 01:04:38,884
portion with the exterior of the castle itself.
There, you can see the masonry is fine, the stones

999
01:04:38,884 --> 01:04:44,177
themselves are clean-cut and joined properly.
There isn't a whole lot in the way of ornate

1000
01:04:44,177 --> 01:04:48,754
craftsmanship on the exterior of the castle or the
walls, but you feel, as far as your interest,

1001
01:04:48,754 --> 01:04:51,555
Grog, this is a good wall.

1002
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:52,505
TRAVIS: Very nice.

1003
01:04:52,505 --> 01:04:54,286
MATT: You mark your territory expertly.

1004
01:04:54,286 --> 01:04:59,078
TRAVIS: In a wide, arcing pattern, not like the
one shot, like a nice, upside-down crown.

1005
01:04:59,078 --> 01:05:06,082
MATT: There you go, like a Cylon eyebeam. Yeah,
totally. You do so with gusto. Congratulations.

1006
01:05:06,082 --> 01:05:08,785
TRAVIS: Thank you. Home.

1007
01:05:08,785 --> 01:05:12,380
MATT: That's how Grog spells home.

1008
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:14,395
MARISHA: Stellar RP.

1009
01:05:14,395 --> 01:05:16,242
TRAVIS: How else do you spell home?

1010
01:05:16,242 --> 01:05:20,339
MATT: Unless there's anything else that needs to
be done--

1011
01:05:20,339 --> 01:05:23,432
LIAM: I'm not done with my errands. Can I go find
Kynan?

1012
01:05:23,432 --> 01:05:33,727
MATT: You can. Kynan, who is currently under the
watch of Jarett at the moment, is asleep. You

1013
01:05:33,727 --> 01:05:38,391
start walking towards the direction as Scanlan is
leaving the exterior of the barrack training

1014
01:05:38,391 --> 01:05:39,428
grounds.

1015
01:05:39,428 --> 01:05:40,507
LIAM: Hey, buddy.

1016
01:05:40,507 --> 01:05:41,286
SAM: Hi.

1017
01:05:41,286 --> 01:05:43,349
LIAM: You look a little rough. You all right?

1018
01:05:43,349 --> 01:05:47,844
SAM: I'm fine. One of our employees punched me in
the face.

1019
01:05:47,844 --> 01:05:50,617
LIAM: Which one?

1020
01:05:50,617 --> 01:05:54,341
SAM: You don't want to know. It wasn't the cooking
cook.

1021
01:05:54,341 --> 01:05:59,524
LIAM: You look really tense. You look out of
character.

1022
01:05:59,524 --> 01:06:02,898
SAM: (growls)

1023
01:06:02,898 --> 01:06:13,609
LIAM: Oh dear. Head back. We're going to have that
meeting soon. Get your game face on, yeah?

1024
01:06:13,609 --> 01:06:18,153
SAM: I will. I'll wash my face. Get to it.

1025
01:06:18,153 --> 01:06:19,545
LIAM: All right.

1026
01:06:19,545 --> 01:06:20,992
SAM: How are you doing?

1027
01:06:20,992 --> 01:06:22,641
LIAM: I'm good.

1028
01:06:22,641 --> 01:06:23,970
SAM: Yeah?

1029
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:25,512
LIAM: Best I've been in a while.

1030
01:06:25,512 --> 01:06:33,853
SAM: That's good to hear. It's been a while since
we had one of our depressing chats. You seem a

1031
01:06:33,853 --> 01:06:37,777
little more chipper these days. Coming around to
my perspective, are you?

1032
01:06:37,777 --> 01:06:42,132
LIAM: Can I make an insight check?

1033
01:06:42,132 --> 01:06:43,229
MATT: Yeah, make an insight check.

1034
01:06:43,229 --> 01:06:46,870
LIAM: Seems full of shit to me. I'm going to use
luck. I've got it.

1035
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:48,174
TRAVIS: That's your second luck!

1036
01:06:48,174 --> 01:06:55,095
LIAM: Who cares? This is a game. I'm with my
friends. I'm having fun. That is an 18.

1037
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:59,000
MATT: 18. Are you deceiving him any?

1038
01:06:59,000 --> 01:06:59,982
SAM: No! Not at all.

1039
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:03,614
LIAM: But does he seem confident and happy is what
I wanted to know.

1040
01:07:03,614 --> 01:07:06,201
MATT: As much as he would in the given situation,
yeah.

1041
01:07:06,201 --> 01:07:15,982
LIAM: All right. (sighs) I'm happy. I'm in love.

1042
01:07:15,982 --> 01:07:18,250
SAM: Really?

1043
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,289
LIAM: Yeah.

1044
01:07:20,289 --> 01:07:22,244
SAM: Do I know the fella?

1045
01:07:22,244 --> 01:07:27,827
LIAM: Yeah. I'll tell you later, all right?

1046
01:07:27,827 --> 01:07:32,820
SAM: I want to hear details! Dirty, dirty details!
Sweaty details!

1047
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:37,577
LIAM: Oh, he is so hung. Unbelievably hung.

1048
01:07:37,577 --> 01:07:39,828
MARISHA: So much dick talk!

1049
01:07:39,828 --> 01:07:45,892
LIAM: I'll tell you later. I have to run an
errand. We have to get to this fucking meeting, yeah?

1050
01:07:45,892 --> 01:07:48,156
SAM: Oh yeah. I'll see you there. Game face on.

1051
01:07:48,156 --> 01:07:50,237
MARISHA: Is this how they talk themselves up?

1052
01:07:50,237 --> 01:07:53,463
TRAVIS: Yeah, don't women talk about their
vaginas?

1053
01:07:53,463 --> 01:07:58,227
LIAM: I'm talking about your goddamn antlers.
Jeepers. Off I go.

1054
01:07:58,227 --> 01:08:00,121
SAM: Locker room talk.

1055
01:08:00,121 --> 01:08:01,029
LAURA: Oh.

1056
01:08:01,029 --> 01:08:03,018
(laughter)

1057
01:08:03,018 --> 01:08:04,513
LIAM: (yells) No!

1058
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:13,977
MATT: The campaign is over. Whitestone burns in
flames. You make your way there. Jarett, you can

1059
01:08:13,977 --> 01:08:19,085
see, finishing a meal. Looks over to you. There's
nobody else in the training area. It's still

1060
01:08:19,085 --> 01:08:25,926
relatively early. You do, with your perception,
see back on the main stone building, you see a few

1061
01:08:25,926 --> 01:08:30,146
individuals walking back and forth in front of one
of the windows. It looks like things are starting

1062
01:08:30,146 --> 01:08:32,671
up over there for training for the day. Jarett
finishes his meal, scarfs up the last bit of egg

1063
01:08:32,671 --> 01:08:34,786
on the side of the plate, "Hey!"

1064
01:08:34,786 --> 01:08:35,928
LIAM: Jarett!

1065
01:08:35,928 --> 01:08:36,806
MATT: "Yes!"

1066
01:08:36,806 --> 01:08:41,559
LIAM: Hey, I don't want to interrupt. Kynan, the
new guy. Is he around?

1067
01:08:41,559 --> 01:08:44,354
MATT: "Probably inside, sleeping or waking."

1068
01:08:44,354 --> 01:08:45,862
LIAM: Okay if I go in?

1069
01:08:45,862 --> 01:08:47,778
MATT: "Sure. This way."

1070
01:08:47,816 --> 01:08:48,997
LIAM: Just be a minute.

1071
01:08:48,997 --> 01:08:55,809
MATT: "Sure, go for it." He sits back down. You
head inside. The door's not locked. You open it.

1072
01:08:55,809 --> 01:09:01,015
You see ten different individuals that are all in
the process of waking up. You can smell coffee.

1073
01:09:01,015 --> 01:09:07,680
Very basic breakfast meats being cooked. Some of
them are around tables talking, hunched forward

1074
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:11,846
and laughing. As soon as you walk in, a few of
them turn and look at you. Some don't recognize

1075
01:09:11,846 --> 01:09:18,673
you, some do. You see, in the far corner sitting
alone at one of the tables is Kynan, who is

1076
01:09:18,673 --> 01:09:24,159
prison-style guarding his food and eating by
himself.

1077
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:30,210
LIAM: Right towards him. Hey.

1078
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:32,132
MATT: "Hello."

1079
01:09:32,132 --> 01:09:34,439
LIAM: How are you fitting in?

1080
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:44,003
MATT: "All right. Everyone here's been fine."

1081
01:09:44,003 --> 01:09:45,727
LIAM: You hanging back?

1082
01:09:45,727 --> 01:09:53,159
MATT: "I mean, as much as I need to. This is still
a lot. Jarett's been good. He's been watching."

1083
01:09:53,159 --> 01:10:08,200
LIAM: He's a good man. Yeah, I get it. We killed
another dragon.

1084
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:12,717
MATT: "That-- wow."

1085
01:10:12,717 --> 01:10:19,437
LIAM: Yeah. I don't want you to question your
decision here, all right?

1086
01:10:19,437 --> 01:10:28,596
MATT: "No, I mean-- I don't have anything else
right now really. So, what's the question?"

1087
01:10:28,596 --> 01:10:35,274
LIAM: There's no question. But if you could, I
have two favors I want to ask.

1088
01:10:35,274 --> 01:10:36,650
MATT: "Okay."

1089
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:43,806
LIAM: First one is, after I leave here today,
could you embrace these people?

1090
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:48,610
MATT: "Yeah, I'm trying."

1091
01:10:48,610 --> 01:10:55,790
LIAM: Yeah, I know, and I know you have
reservations, and I know that you've got guilt.

1092
01:10:55,790 --> 01:11:06,108
When I walk out of here, I want you to work on
letting go of that. For real! Leap of faith kind

1093
01:11:06,108 --> 01:11:08,241
of shit. Just let go of it.

1094
01:11:08,241 --> 01:11:11,684
MATT: (sighs) "Well, I'll do my best."

1095
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:17,937
LIAM: I know. Scratch that, three favors.

1096
01:11:17,937 --> 01:11:22,350
MATT: He looks down a little bit for a second
seeming like "oh boy."

1097
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:28,773
LIAM: Yeah, I know I'm a handful. The second one,
I don't even need for you to say anything about

1098
01:11:28,773 --> 01:11:34,449
this, but you know the white-haired guy I travel
with?

1099
01:11:34,449 --> 01:11:36,365
MATT: "Yeah."

1100
01:11:36,365 --> 01:11:46,572
LIAM: Yeah. He's got a sister, and I don't want
you to do anything other than keep an eye on her

1101
01:11:46,572 --> 01:11:48,695
and keep her safe.

1102
01:11:48,695 --> 01:11:52,803
MATT: "Okay?"

1103
01:11:52,803 --> 01:12:10,293
LIAM: We're going into the lion's den. Soon, I
think. And we'll probably come out of it, but just

1104
01:12:10,293 --> 01:12:21,664
in case. She's got a lot on her shoulders; you
know that. So just keep an eye on her. That's it.

1105
01:12:21,664 --> 01:12:24,843
All right?

1106
01:12:24,843 --> 01:12:26,608
MATT: "All right."

1107
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:33,411
LIAM: And the last thing. You've got those knives
I gave you, right?

1108
01:12:33,411 --> 01:12:34,803
MATT: "Yeah."

1109
01:12:34,803 --> 01:12:41,572
LIAM: Yeah, hold onto them. I trust you. I need
you to watch after one last thing thing for me,

1110
01:12:41,572 --> 01:13:00,282
all right? It's <i>very</i> important. I wake up Simon,
and I let him crawl down my arm. Do you see this guy?

1111
01:13:00,282 --> 01:13:02,404
MATT: "Yeah."

1112
01:13:02,404 --> 01:13:11,572
LIAM: He's been with me through a lot, and I don't
want him at the bottom of a ditch.

1113
01:13:11,572 --> 01:13:16,100
MATT: "Are you sure?"

1114
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:24,528
LIAM: I have never been more sure of anything in
my life. I want you to have him, and I want you to

1115
01:13:24,528 --> 01:13:26,849
take care of him.

1116
01:13:26,849 --> 01:13:32,215
MATT: "I'll do that. It'll be done. I promise."

1117
01:13:32,215 --> 01:13:40,135
LIAM: Kynan, I need you to believe in second
chances.

1118
01:13:40,135 --> 01:13:48,859
MATT: "It's all I have to keep me going right
now." He reaches his hand up towards the snake,

1119
01:13:48,859 --> 01:13:55,832
and Simon leaps from from your hand to his and
swirls down his arm. He looks confused for a

1120
01:13:55,832 --> 01:14:04,379
second as it wraps around his waist and then forms
into the shape of a belt. You now see a few other

1121
01:14:04,379 --> 01:14:07,299
guys in the room, and the room's got a little bit
quieter. They're all watching what's happening,

1122
01:14:07,299 --> 01:14:14,205
"What's going on?" He notices the attention and,
"I'll take good care of him."

1123
01:14:14,205 --> 01:14:16,511
LIAM: I believe you.

1124
01:14:16,511 --> 01:14:24,613
MATT: "I mean no offense. It's a lot of attention
right now."

1125
01:14:24,613 --> 01:14:35,663
LIAM: I give a slap on his cheek. Remember
everything I said, all right?

1126
01:14:35,663 --> 01:14:38,587
MATT: "Yeah, I will."

1127
01:14:38,587 --> 01:14:43,167
LIAM: You're a good kid. (whack)

1128
01:14:43,167 --> 01:14:50,603
MATT: (soft chuckle) "Same temple."

1129
01:14:50,603 --> 01:14:55,796
LIAM: I'll see you later, all right?

1130
01:14:55,796 --> 01:15:09,678
MATT: "Yeah. Definitely." And you head out. Okay.
At this point in time, a number of pages have been

1131
01:15:09,678 --> 01:15:13,452
sent throughout the city to gather those who've
been wandering about Whitestone, as you are being

1132
01:15:13,452 --> 01:15:17,805
called to the meeting in the second floor war room
held within the castle itself.

1133
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:19,668
MARISHA: Second floor?

1134
01:15:19,668 --> 01:15:22,084
MATT: Same one where you met with--

1135
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:26,498
MARISHA: Asum? That'll do. All right.

1136
01:15:26,498 --> 01:15:29,130
TALIESIN: Be ready for anything.

1137
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:34,608
TRAVIS: Let's go Krogering! The best of
everything!

1138
01:15:34,608 --> 01:15:42,033
MARISHA: Before we walk in, I grab Grog. How do
you do it?

1139
01:15:42,033 --> 01:15:43,759
TRAVIS: Do what?

1140
01:15:43,759 --> 01:15:50,550
MARISHA: You're able to utilize your rage when
necessary. How do you keep it suppressed when it's

1141
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:52,550
not needed?

1142
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:56,018
TRAVIS: Ah. Well, good question.

1143
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:59,517
MARISHA: Please enlighten me, Professor Grog.

1144
01:15:59,517 --> 01:16:06,911
TRAVIS: Right. It all comes down to one word,
really. (clears throat) Family. Right, before I

1145
01:16:06,911 --> 01:16:16,121
was a part of this group, I had no family. Pike
took me in, I met all of you. And I had a purpose.

1146
01:16:16,121 --> 01:16:25,694
So before that, I would be down to fuck anything
up, anytime, no problem. I still kind of am. But I

1147
01:16:25,694 --> 01:16:33,777
realized that if I fly off the handle too soon, it
screws over my family. That's no good, because I

1148
01:16:33,777 --> 01:16:36,887
care about you. Most of you.

1149
01:16:36,887 --> 01:16:39,584
(laughter)

1150
01:16:39,584 --> 01:16:46,560
TRAVIS: You're going to get yours. It's coming.
And I'm going to help you. And I'm going to high

1151
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:55,293
five you when it's done. But until then, you keep
that shit tucked inside. Let it build. And then

1152
01:16:55,293 --> 01:17:03,168
when the time is right, you let her have it. And
I'll throw you into the fray, when the time is right.

1153
01:17:03,168 --> 01:17:04,928
MARISHA: Promise?

1154
01:17:04,928 --> 01:17:06,832
TRAVIS: Yeah, I promise.

1155
01:17:06,832 --> 01:17:08,004
MARISHA: Deal.

1156
01:17:08,004 --> 01:17:09,059
TRAVIS: Deal.

1157
01:17:09,059 --> 01:17:10,233
(cracking noise)

1158
01:17:10,233 --> 01:17:11,773
(laughter)

1159
01:17:11,773 --> 01:17:12,750
MARISHA: Ow! Ow, Grog! Grog!

1160
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:13,885
TRAVIS: Oh shit, sorry! I'm so sorry!

1161
01:17:13,885 --> 01:17:16,404
MARISHA: No, it's fine. I appreciate it. It's
good.

1162
01:17:16,404 --> 01:17:18,155
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah. Bruises, right?

1163
01:17:18,155 --> 01:17:20,105
LIAM: She should really take one hit point of
damage.

1164
01:17:20,105 --> 01:17:21,771
(laughter)

1165
01:17:21,771 --> 01:17:23,933
MATT: Sure, you take a hit point of damage.

1166
01:17:23,933 --> 01:17:27,214
MARISHA: Oh man, people are going to ask
questions about that later.

1167
01:17:27,214 --> 01:17:29,449
TRAVIS: No, it's cool. You make up a really good
story.

1168
01:17:29,449 --> 01:17:31,809
MARISHA: Sure. Yeah.

1169
01:17:31,809 --> 01:17:37,791
TRAVIS: But listen. If at any time it gets to be
too much, you just go. We've got you.

1170
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:41,275
MARISHA: Okay. I don't want to let you guys down.

1171
01:17:41,275 --> 01:17:43,523
TRAVIS: You won't.

1172
01:17:43,523 --> 01:17:48,898
MARISHA: Thanks, Grog. Okay. (clears throat) Let's
do this.

1173
01:17:48,898 --> 01:17:53,815
MATT: All right. You guys enter the war room, same
as it was previously left. However, you are

1174
01:17:53,815 --> 01:18:04,842
brought the image of the table in early morning:
Allura, Gilmore, surprisingly, Drake Thunderbrand,

1175
01:18:04,842 --> 01:18:14,203
Cassandra, as well as Asum, who's standing behind
most of them, back to the window. They all, middle

1176
01:18:14,203 --> 01:18:23,072
of conversation, turn, and smile as you begin to
walk in. You see Gilmore nods to everybody. Gives

1177
01:18:23,072 --> 01:18:31,844
an extra smile to you, Vax. Cassandra's waiting
for the pleasantries to end. Allura comes up and

1178
01:18:31,844 --> 01:18:41,395
takes your hand, and she goes, "It's wonderful to
see that you've returned safely. I've had many

1179
01:18:41,395 --> 01:18:46,838
"terrible thoughts that perhaps this meeting would
not be as positive, and I'm very glad to know that

1180
01:18:46,838 --> 01:18:54,782
"I was wrong. And that you brought Kima back to us
as well. Pike is safe as well. So congratulations,

1181
01:18:54,782 --> 01:19:06,180
"I guess, are in order. Come, sit. These
circumstances do press our timeline a bit." And

1182
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:09,825
you see there are a number of other chairs already
brought into the room, prepared for you guys to

1183
01:19:09,825 --> 01:19:11,122
sit around together.

1184
01:19:11,122 --> 01:19:12,742
MARISHA: Is there anyone sitting next to Raishan?

1185
01:19:12,742 --> 01:19:14,458
MATT: No, actually.

1186
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:16,086
MARISHA: I sit next to Raishan.

1187
01:19:16,086 --> 01:19:19,331
MATT: Raishan is not sitting. Raishan is standing
with her arms crossed, leaning against the

1188
01:19:19,331 --> 01:19:20,296
window.

1189
01:19:20,296 --> 01:19:21,616
LAURA: I want to stay standing as well.

1190
01:19:21,616 --> 01:19:23,743
MARISHA: Yeah, I move closer to Raishan.

1191
01:19:23,743 --> 01:19:29,829
MATT: Okay. As you approach, you see Asum's eyes
watch you. Small grin on the face, and a little nod.

1192
01:19:29,829 --> 01:19:31,298
MARISHA: I give a nod back.

1193
01:19:31,298 --> 01:19:42,256
TALIESIN: I pull a chair out for Asum, and I'm
going to offer him the chair and sit. And pull one

1194
01:19:42,256 --> 01:19:44,790
out extra for myself.

1195
01:19:44,790 --> 01:19:53,976
MATT: At which point Cassandra gathers all of your
attention in the midst of this chaos. "The

1196
01:19:53,976 --> 01:20:02,187
"excursion to Wildemount went well. As far as I
understand, you are now one more dragon-slaying

1197
01:20:02,187 --> 01:20:11,068
"into this chaotic endeavor. Well done. Tell me,
how did this happen?"

1198
01:20:11,068 --> 01:20:21,688
TALIESIN: A deal was made with the locals. We
brought the dragon to an appointed kill spot

1199
01:20:21,688 --> 01:20:25,501
outside of the city. We summoned a creature.

1200
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:28,445
LAURA: With the Gate scroll that we showed you,
actually.

1201
01:20:28,445 --> 01:20:38,321
TALIESIN: There was a battle. And we felled it.
That was more or less how it went down. It was a

1202
01:20:38,321 --> 01:20:41,554
simple trap, it was elegant, and we barely
survived.

1203
01:20:41,554 --> 01:20:50,306
MARISHA: I pull out the Spire of Conflux and hand
it to her. We retrieved this in our spoils. You

1204
01:20:50,306 --> 01:20:52,811
may recognize it as one of the Vestiges that we
spoke of earlier.

1205
01:20:52,811 --> 01:21:00,152
MATT: Cassandra takes it and says, "It looks quite
important. Allura."

1206
01:21:00,152 --> 01:21:02,611
MARISHA: Yes, I thought I was handing it to
Allura.

1207
01:21:02,611 --> 01:21:04,222
(laughter)

1208
01:21:04,222 --> 01:21:06,510
MARISHA: Sorry. It was meant for Allura.

1209
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:08,760
MATT: I can see how this would be confusing.

1210
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:09,972
MARISHA: Yes.

1211
01:21:09,972 --> 01:21:12,255
SAM: You look just like Allura right now.

1212
01:21:12,255 --> 01:21:16,429
LAURA: Allura, is everything okay? Have you been
through some shit, Allura?

1213
01:21:16,429 --> 01:21:17,801
MATT: "It's been a rough week."

1214
01:21:17,801 --> 01:21:19,097
(laughter)

1215
01:21:19,097 --> 01:21:22,111
MATT: I almost did Allura, too. Next Halloween.

1216
01:21:22,111 --> 01:21:25,625
LIAM: Vax is leaning against the door to this
chamber, by the way.

1217
01:21:25,625 --> 01:21:33,121
MATT: All right. Allura takes it, inspects it.
"This is a magnificent artifact. Well found.

1218
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:36,909
"Perhaps we'll take a look at it after the meeting
together."

1219
01:21:36,909 --> 01:21:38,093
MARISHA: Sure.

1220
01:21:38,093 --> 01:21:44,831
MATT: Cassandra gets everyone's attention once
more, motions to the guards. The door that you're

1221
01:21:44,831 --> 01:21:51,565
leaning by gets closed as the guards step out, so
it's only you guys having this conversation. "So,

1222
01:21:51,565 --> 01:21:59,232
"with another of the Conclave fallen, retaliation
is imminent. And with Thordak already infuriated

1223
01:21:59,232 --> 01:22:06,720
"at the death of Umbrasyl, and we only caught but a
glance of that anger, thankfully through the means

1224
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:11,351
"of which Allura and Gilmore and others were able
to cloak the city, I do not feel that will last

1225
01:22:11,351 --> 01:22:17,910
"the entirety of the time we would need to take a
leisurely stroll through our next series of plans.

1226
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:26,136
"I fear that less protected cities may be in the
path of retaliation before it finds its way to

1227
01:22:26,136 --> 01:22:34,497
"us." Allura speaks up at this point and goes,
"Thordak is a creature of infinite pride. And a

1228
01:22:34,497 --> 01:22:37,964
"slight such as this against the Conclave will most
likely trigger the destruction of even more

1229
01:22:37,964 --> 01:22:47,456
"innocents. Both to satiate his anger and, I'm
certain, to also draw us out. He is an intelligent

1230
01:22:47,456 --> 01:22:57,565
"one, as is the company he keeps. I've also reached
out to other members of the Arcana Pansophical,

1231
01:22:57,565 --> 01:23:05,120
"and hope that they would come to our aid, but
given the recent death of Vorugal, I do not know

1232
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:10,751
"if they'll arrive in time to be of any assistance.
So we have to begin to gather our strengths, our

1233
01:23:10,751 --> 01:23:16,524
"allies. And honestly, I think we need to strike
first."

1234
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:18,053
TRAVIS: You do?

1235
01:23:18,053 --> 01:23:22,904
MATT: "Well, otherwise we wait for the fight to be
on Thordak's turf."

1236
01:23:22,904 --> 01:23:26,815
TRAVIS: That's unexpected.

1237
01:23:26,815 --> 01:23:29,202
LAURA: Just pop on over to Emon, then?

1238
01:23:29,202 --> 01:23:35,104
MATT: "Well, we need a plan first. We need to
gather those we've called to arms. We need to

1239
01:23:35,104 --> 01:23:41,771
"assess what strengths we have, and utilizing all
of these things at our disposal, come up with an

1240
01:23:41,771 --> 01:23:48,420
"idea of how we're actually going to do this."
Gilmore steps in and goes, "If we are to strike, I

1241
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:54,332
"agree it should also be very soon. We've pushed
the boundaries of being on his peripheral even

1242
01:23:54,332 --> 01:23:59,068
"this long. And you say that he knows your faces,
correct?"

1243
01:23:59,068 --> 01:24:00,180
TALIESIN: Yes.

1244
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:07,155
MATT: "His gaze will now surely fall upon the
seven of you, at the very least."

1245
01:24:07,155 --> 01:24:11,733
TALIESIN: It was inevitable.

1246
01:24:11,733 --> 01:24:17,871
MATT: Asum steps forward at this point, from the
wall, and begins to walk in front of you, Keyleth,

1247
01:24:17,871 --> 01:24:27,449
and between Percy, "The longer he remains as well,
the more the landscape of Emon and the surrounding

1248
01:24:27,449 --> 01:24:39,401
"Bladeshimmer Shoreline begins to churn. Begins to
boil with flame and toxic fume. He is scarring the

1249
01:24:39,401 --> 01:24:48,000
"surrounding land with his claws, his teeth, his
flames, his roar, and those that follow in his

1250
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:57,524
"shadow. His fearmongering has risen a number under
him. A creature of such pride is eager to show that if

1251
01:24:57,524 --> 01:25:05,804
"you fall in such fear and do as he says, there are
rewards. I'm sure you've come across many

1252
01:25:05,804 --> 01:25:10,444
"weak-willed individuals in your travels that would
be eager to jump at the chance of working beneath

1253
01:25:10,444 --> 01:25:13,521
"such a powerful and dangerous creature."

1254
01:25:13,521 --> 01:25:23,937
Allura steps in at this point now and says, "Now I
believe it is partially his essence, but the

1255
01:25:23,937 --> 01:25:32,854
"expedited rate of this elemental transition around
him is based on the soul anchor that we embedded

1256
01:25:32,854 --> 01:25:40,834
"within him to keep him in the Fire Elemental
Plane. This stone that resides in the center of

1257
01:25:40,834 --> 01:25:49,403
"his chest and belly. I believe this stone is
somehow drawing elements of the essence of the

1258
01:25:49,403 --> 01:25:57,120
"Fire Elemental Plane itself into Emon. I mean,
it's not unusual for the presence of a red dragon

1259
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:06,208
"over hundreds of years to begin to convert the
scenery around, but this speed... I can only see a

1260
01:26:06,208 --> 01:26:11,328
"connection between the enchantment that we hoped
would hold Thordak at bay, and the changes we're

1261
01:26:11,328 --> 01:26:18,119
"seeing at the center of Emon and beyond. Now, it
was never intended for him to leave that place,

1262
01:26:18,119 --> 01:26:25,990
"and I feel deeply responsible for many elements of
the danger we now see in this world. I only know

1263
01:26:25,990 --> 01:26:31,199
"that I will do whatever it takes on my end to see
that this comes to an end. Whatever sacrifice,

1264
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:40,939
"whatever is necessary. I'm at your disposal. But
the responsibility of the destruction is also our

1265
01:26:40,939 --> 01:26:50,946
"own. The longer we take, the more chance he will
tear through Kymal. He will tear through Westruun.

1266
01:26:50,946 --> 01:27:01,337
"He will tear through Daxio. He will begin to burn
everything that Tal'Dorei is, until we show our faces."

1267
01:27:01,337 --> 01:27:07,588
LIAM: I am curious what the Master of Secrets
thinks. Asum?

1268
01:27:07,588 --> 01:27:11,296
MATT: Asum is still walking a circle around the
table.

1269
01:27:11,296 --> 01:27:13,344
LIAM: What do you propose we do?

1270
01:27:13,344 --> 01:27:25,994
MATT: "Hmph. Well, before we get to that, let us
discuss things we have at our disposal, the

1271
01:27:25,994 --> 01:27:35,974
"information we have, and from that, we can garnish a
plan. I am the Master of Secrets; I am not a Master

1272
01:27:35,974 --> 01:27:37,900
"of Warmongering and Attack."

1273
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:46,287
TALIESIN: I get up, I walk to the window, and I
look out the window. We're not going to be safe

1274
01:27:46,287 --> 01:27:51,449
here for much longer, that much is certain. We
will need to move quickly.

1275
01:27:51,449 --> 01:27:56,286
MATT: Drake speaks up for the first time and goes,
"Aye, not to mention that slippery green drake is

1276
01:27:56,286 --> 01:27:59,398
"still out there somewhere, and we have no idea
where it is. Two members of the Conclave are

1277
01:27:59,398 --> 01:28:00,871
"remaining."

1278
01:28:00,871 --> 01:28:08,833
TRAVIS: Well-- Ow! Right, yeah. Two.

1279
01:28:08,833 --> 01:28:20,561
TALIESIN: Do you think perhaps it's best to skip
one and hope for the element of surprise? Maybe he

1280
01:28:20,561 --> 01:28:28,004
thinks we're going to finish off his generals
before we come to him. It may be a <i>brief</i> moment

1281
01:28:28,004 --> 01:28:34,400
of surprise. If anything, maybe he's expecting us
to kill one more, not go for the main prize.

1282
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,138
LIAM: Cut off the head of the king?

1283
01:28:36,138 --> 01:28:37,245
TALIESIN: Maybe.

1284
01:28:37,245 --> 01:28:46,116
SAM: Thordak, from what I understand, is extremely
powerful and influential. That Raishan dragon is a

1285
01:28:46,116 --> 01:28:55,527
mere pittance in comparison. A small, exponential
ant, a pawn, if you will, on the battlefield.

1286
01:28:55,527 --> 01:29:01,810
MATT: "I certainly hope so. And if that's the
case, then I think you're right. Go for the king

1287
01:29:01,810 --> 01:29:06,983
"first. But we must do so with eyes all about us
because the last thing we need is to be flanked by

1288
01:29:06,983 --> 01:29:08,974
"that beast in the center of our attack."

1289
01:29:08,974 --> 01:29:11,783
MARISHA: Exactly. We don't want to deal with two
ancient dragons.

1290
01:29:11,783 --> 01:29:15,408
TALIESIN: Can we lure it somewhere else, perhaps?

1291
01:29:15,408 --> 01:29:25,224
MATT: "If we knew where it fucking was." Allura
speaks up at this point and goes, "Look. I know

1292
01:29:25,224 --> 01:29:29,988
"that Thordak's hate for me still burns, hence the
reason why they went directly for my tower when

1293
01:29:29,988 --> 01:29:36,123
"they first arrived in Emon. The one trump card we
do have in this is me."

1294
01:29:36,123 --> 01:29:40,338
LAURA: Do you want to offer yourself as bait?

1295
01:29:40,338 --> 01:29:45,152
MATT: "If need be. I'm not saying that's the right
plan, but I'm saying it is one thing we can

1296
01:29:45,152 --> 01:29:48,309
"perhaps utilize in our plan, in our strategy."

1297
01:29:48,309 --> 01:29:49,972
TRAVIS: Is his hate for you?

1298
01:29:49,972 --> 01:30:01,324
TALIESIN: I think-- There was a
ship in Draconia, a northern ship of some kind. I

1299
01:30:01,324 --> 01:30:08,574
still feel there may be some sort of weapon inside it
that may prove useful. It was a ship that had been

1300
01:30:08,574 --> 01:30:15,138
dragged there by the white dragon. It's been
bothering me. And then of course we have whatever

1301
01:30:15,138 --> 01:30:22,034
it is we have downstairs. I'm not saying we should
use it, but it is powerful.

1302
01:30:22,034 --> 01:30:24,430
LAURA: I don't know how we would use it.

1303
01:30:24,430 --> 01:30:25,690
TRAVIS: We can't move it, can we?

1304
01:30:25,690 --> 01:30:27,272
LAURA: We can't touch it.

1305
01:30:27,272 --> 01:30:34,493
MATT: Gilmore pops up again and says, "Exactly. We
were poring over that thing for a number of

1306
01:30:34,493 --> 01:30:38,580
"weeks, until we had to build this barrier. And to
be perfectly honest, I am sick of it."

1307
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:39,990
LIAM: You've got nothing?

1308
01:30:39,990 --> 01:30:45,918
MATT: "Well, we understand it's a siphon. It's
bringing the energy of the nexus somewhere. We

1309
01:30:45,918 --> 01:30:49,933
"don't know where the other end of it is. Or if
it's even functioning properly."

1310
01:30:49,933 --> 01:30:55,794
MARISHA: Allura, do you still feel a connection
with the soul stone that's inside of Thordak?

1311
01:30:55,794 --> 01:31:01,107
MATT: "Well, I have no personal connection to it, I
know that I was the architect of its enchantment,

1312
01:31:01,107 --> 01:31:05,179
"and the ruse, of which sealed it within Thordak."

1313
01:31:05,179 --> 01:31:09,046
MARISHA: You built it. You must know of some way
to disable it.

1314
01:31:09,046 --> 01:31:10,350
TRAVIS: Or a weakness.

1315
01:31:10,350 --> 01:31:11,268
MARISHA: Yeah.

1316
01:31:11,268 --> 01:31:29,602
MATT: "We designed it to have no weakness. The
intent was to keep him there indefinitely. Perhaps

1317
01:31:29,602 --> 01:31:32,265
"if we could--"

1318
01:31:32,265 --> 01:31:33,343
MARISHA: What?

1319
01:31:33,343 --> 01:31:37,899
MATT: "Asum. You said you have friends, back in
Emon still, that have been gathering intel." Asum

1320
01:31:37,899 --> 01:31:44,460
turns. "Yes, actually. And I was hoping that, as
part of our plan today, we could even go and

1321
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:50,107
"retrieve some of this information. Perhaps that
could teach us more about this soul anchor you

1322
01:31:50,107 --> 01:31:51,759
"continuously talk about."

1323
01:31:51,759 --> 01:31:54,378
SAM: How can we retrieve this information without
going to Emon?

1324
01:31:54,378 --> 01:31:57,899
MATT: "Oh, we would have to go to Emon."

1325
01:31:57,899 --> 01:32:04,407
SAM: That sounds crazy. Is there any way to not do
that?

1326
01:32:04,407 --> 01:32:08,390
MATT: "Perhaps I'll go alone."

1327
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:16,776
MARISHA: The soul stone has been broken and abused
before. I have a feeling there's someone who might

1328
01:32:16,776 --> 01:32:22,526
have an idea on how to disable it.

1329
01:32:22,526 --> 01:32:26,564
TRAVIS: I really don't, I have no idea.

1330
01:32:26,564 --> 01:32:31,384
MARISHA: Well, Raishan was the one who busted out
Thordak in the first place, out of the Fire Plane.

1331
01:32:31,384 --> 01:32:35,656
So I would assume that Raishan has some idea on
how to--

1332
01:32:35,656 --> 01:32:37,497
TRAVIS: Oh.

1333
01:32:37,497 --> 01:32:43,112
LAURA: You think? I feel like Raishan would only
know how to open up a portal.

1334
01:32:43,112 --> 01:32:47,487
MARISHA: Well, I have a lot of feelings about
Raishan.

1335
01:32:47,487 --> 01:32:58,217
MATT: Cassandra speaks up and says, "Well, you've
been abroad. You've been gaining arms and allies,

1336
01:32:58,217 --> 01:33:05,796
"from what you've told me from across Exandria. Let
us consolidate our options, our strengths, and

1337
01:33:05,796 --> 01:33:09,434
"plop it down in front of the Conclave, best we
can."

1338
01:33:09,434 --> 01:33:18,973
SAM: I'm no master strategist, but we do have
allies that we can call upon, and weapons, and men

1339
01:33:18,973 --> 01:33:29,915
and arms and troops. However, taking the fight to
Thordak in Emon seems foolhardy at best. I suppose

1340
01:33:29,915 --> 01:33:35,828
this is where the intelligence could come into
play. Is there some other place where we could go

1341
01:33:35,828 --> 01:33:43,030
and try to take back from Thordak, to lure him
away from Emon?

1342
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:50,328
MATT: Asum steps into the conversation and goes,
"The thing with that plan is Thordak has amassed

1343
01:33:50,328 --> 01:33:56,581
"thousands of lizardfolk in Emon at this point that
follow his whim. In the nearby mountain ranges,

1344
01:33:56,581 --> 01:34:03,501
"many from the Stormcrest, that worshipped him the
entire time that he was gone. Wyvern riders

1345
01:34:03,501 --> 01:34:11,451
"originally aided in taking the city that you met,
as did I. But since, other allies have found their

1346
01:34:11,451 --> 01:34:21,348
"way to the Cinder King's sway. Last that I
checked, it seemed that there were a number of

1347
01:34:21,348 --> 01:34:24,955
"allies that he brought over from his time in the
Fire Plane as well."

1348
01:34:24,955 --> 01:34:26,804
LAURA: What?!

1349
01:34:26,804 --> 01:34:29,662
MATT: "Fire giants, in the service of the dragon,
now walk the streets."

1350
01:34:29,662 --> 01:34:38,888
SAM: So, if we go into Emon, we're facing fire
giants, lizard people, and that's before we get to

1351
01:34:38,888 --> 01:34:40,364
Thordak the Cinder King?

1352
01:34:40,364 --> 01:34:43,696
LAURA: How the fuck are we going to fight him?!

1353
01:34:43,696 --> 01:34:47,324
MATT: "That's what we're discussing today."

1354
01:34:47,324 --> 01:34:56,573
SAM: Does Thordak covet any other territory, or
city, or town? Vasselheim? Here? Anywhere that we

1355
01:34:56,573 --> 01:34:57,935
can lure him to?

1356
01:34:57,935 --> 01:35:01,523
TRAVIS: Anything he has nostalgic feelings about?
Glintshore--

1357
01:35:01,523 --> 01:35:03,271
LIAM: Anything that would piss him off?

1358
01:35:03,306 --> 01:35:09,007
MATT: "You were lucky to draw a creature of such
infinitesimal experience and intelligence as a

1359
01:35:09,007 --> 01:35:16,138
"white dragon away from its home roost. I would be
greatly surprised if you had pulled a great,

1360
01:35:16,138 --> 01:35:21,184
"powerful, intelligent, ancient red dragon from its
home turf advantage."

1361
01:35:21,184 --> 01:35:26,734
LIAM: So your prediction is that we have to slog
our way through the outskirts of Emon to fight him

1362
01:35:26,734 --> 01:35:29,984
on his home turf. Is that about the size of it?

1363
01:35:29,984 --> 01:35:31,217
MATT: "That's one way."

1364
01:35:31,217 --> 01:35:33,435
SAM: What's another?

1365
01:35:33,435 --> 01:35:41,269
MATT: "Distract his allies and go straight for the
heart. You have allies, like Allura just said, all

1366
01:35:41,269 --> 01:35:42,879
"throughout the world."

1367
01:35:42,879 --> 01:35:47,665
TRAVIS: This is true. We have the Herd, we can
go get the werewolves.

1368
01:35:47,665 --> 01:35:52,411
SAM: The Ravenites would help.

1369
01:35:52,411 --> 01:35:56,445
MARISHA: Everyone who we ask, everyone who we send
in there, we're sending in to their death.

1370
01:35:56,445 --> 01:35:58,681
TALIESIN: This is war.

1371
01:35:58,681 --> 01:36:03,489
TRAVIS: Yeah, but it's either death now or death a
little later.

1372
01:36:03,489 --> 01:36:05,334
LAURA: We're sending ourselves as well.

1373
01:36:05,334 --> 01:36:10,212
LIAM: So, are we talking about sending everyone we
know and everything we have to the outskirts of town--

1374
01:36:10,212 --> 01:36:14,314
SAM: For a full frontal attack. While we bamf into
the dragon's lair.

1375
01:36:14,314 --> 01:36:21,271
LIAM: Yeah. We create a massive fucking
clusterfuck on the edge of his periphery and we go

1376
01:36:21,271 --> 01:36:22,616
for the center.

1377
01:36:22,616 --> 01:36:27,696
LAURA: How long did it take you, Allura, to create
that heart?

1378
01:36:27,696 --> 01:36:36,079
MATT: "Well. The design and the development and
enchantment of it are powerful enough to anchor

1379
01:36:36,079 --> 01:36:41,605
"itself to the soul of a dragon of Thordak's
strength. Better part of six months."

1380
01:36:41,605 --> 01:36:43,773
LIAM and LAURA: Six months.

1381
01:36:43,773 --> 01:36:45,315
LIAM: We've probably got a week or two.

1382
01:36:45,315 --> 01:36:53,772
MATT: "And that was with a dozen other hands
helping me. Most of the Arcana Pansophical was at

1383
01:36:53,772 --> 01:36:56,892
"my side for that and we don't have that kind of
time."

1384
01:36:56,892 --> 01:37:03,789
LIAM: Well, we take a day or two and we amass every
heavy fucking hitter we have, and we do this. What

1385
01:37:03,789 --> 01:37:05,883
other choice do we have?

1386
01:37:05,883 --> 01:37:09,802
MARISHA: I keep thinking back to Emon where we
watched half of our friends die in a second.

1387
01:37:09,802 --> 01:37:13,084
LIAM: A lot of us are going to die.

1388
01:37:13,084 --> 01:37:20,342
MATT: Cassandra sits up a little bit in her seat
and goes, "If we are smart about this, we can

1389
01:37:20,342 --> 01:37:25,901
"minimize the casualties far more now than they
would be a week, two weeks, a month, a year from now."

1390
01:37:25,901 --> 01:37:27,461
TRAVIS: I agree.

1391
01:37:27,461 --> 01:37:36,790
TALIESIN: What of Whitestone? We put the city at
great risk. How much risk are we willing to take?

1392
01:37:36,790 --> 01:37:40,127
LIAM: Percy, everywhere is at great risk right
now.

1393
01:37:40,127 --> 01:37:41,483
MARISHA: It's true.

1394
01:37:41,483 --> 01:37:43,824
TRAVIS: We should leave Whitestone.

1395
01:37:43,824 --> 01:37:54,476
SAM: But even getting to Emon, aren't we exposing
ourselves to detection and attack?

1396
01:37:54,476 --> 01:37:56,015
TRAVIS: We are if we wait.

1397
01:37:56,015 --> 01:38:00,120
SAM: We're going to march several armies across
the entire continent to get there? It'll take days.

1398
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,726
LAURA: How do we get armies there?

1399
01:38:01,726 --> 01:38:04,971
LIAM: We're going to take a day or two. We're
going to figure out how to get who we have to

1400
01:38:04,971 --> 01:38:10,529
where we need. We're not doing this tomorrow. In a
couple of days. Three days. Four days at the most.

1401
01:38:10,529 --> 01:38:16,698
It's not ideal, but it's what we have to do.

1402
01:38:16,698 --> 01:38:23,692
SAM: We can at least move people to, you know.
Where's that town that was established?

1403
01:38:23,692 --> 01:38:26,400
TRAVIS: Outside of Westruun?

1404
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:28,973
MATT: There's Westruun, Kymal were the two that
you moved--

1405
01:38:28,973 --> 01:38:31,133
SAM: Westruun is close-ish, right, to Emon?

1406
01:38:31,133 --> 01:38:38,925
MATT: Westruun's a little bit further than Kymal
is. Kymal is where you sent a lot of the Westruun

1407
01:38:38,925 --> 01:38:41,166
refugees.

1408
01:38:41,166 --> 01:38:42,082
TRAVIS: Right.

1409
01:38:42,082 --> 01:38:43,400
LAURA: But they're just townsfolk.

1410
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:51,435
SAM: But we can at least assemble there, from all
the different territories, and then meet up, form

1411
01:38:51,435 --> 01:38:52,982
a plan, and then march from there.

1412
01:38:52,982 --> 01:39:00,772
LAURA: March on Emon? If we gather our forces,
Thordak will notice.

1413
01:39:00,772 --> 01:39:06,178
TRAVIS: Yeah, we've got to do a lot of recon
before then. But I think he's got a good point,

1414
01:39:06,178 --> 01:39:07,981
right? We've got to have like a staging point.

1415
01:39:07,981 --> 01:39:15,822
MATT: Cassandra turns, looks over to Asum and
goes, "Recon, actually. Anything else, Asum, you

1416
01:39:15,822 --> 01:39:21,769
"may have in regards to what we can expect there?"
Asum is still slowly walking around the peripheral

1417
01:39:21,769 --> 01:39:29,605
of the meeting table. "I can tell you that most of
the city's wealth and resources, as well as

1418
01:39:29,605 --> 01:39:37,148
"caches, sealed arcane relics, and weaponry, long
held by the Lyceum or the arms of Emon, have been

1419
01:39:37,148 --> 01:39:42,330
"stolen and thrown atop the victory hoard of
Thordak. Most who are part of this rebellion

1420
01:39:42,330 --> 01:39:48,993
"within the city are doing so with scraps. That is
why the Clasp has been so instrumental in the

1421
01:39:48,993 --> 01:39:59,124
"removal of many of the oppressed folk within the
city. Also, the fire that marks Thordak's presence

1422
01:39:59,124 --> 01:40:04,776
"that have drawn fire and molten rock across the
city, as well as the outskirts of the city walls,

1423
01:40:04,776 --> 01:40:12,813
"scar the landscape and fill the sky with sulfurous
clouds and black smoke. The good news is that

1424
01:40:12,813 --> 01:40:20,387
"smoke can be utilized, should someone have some
control over the elements, to be a screen.

1425
01:40:20,387 --> 01:40:28,647
"However, where the Cloudtop District once stood,
there is now but a heated cauldron of glowing

1426
01:40:28,647 --> 01:40:35,012
"stone and flame. Hundreds of gifts and statues
left in Thordak's image litter the outer area,

1427
01:40:35,012 --> 01:40:40,789
"while a massive cavern dives beneath the central
region of the district. Now this cavern, as we've

1428
01:40:40,789 --> 01:40:45,670
"watched it, we believe it to be the location of
Thordak's treasure vault. As well as the

1429
01:40:45,670 --> 01:40:52,592
"occasional sleeping place of the massive drake we
speak of. Thordak is also showing rather intense

1430
01:40:52,592 --> 01:40:59,801
"signs of physical change since being released from
his prison. And his size still remains enormous by

1431
01:40:59,801 --> 01:41:12,163
"comparison. His eyes now burn with a searing white
light. Burning stars in the sky. His jaw ever

1432
01:41:12,163 --> 01:41:17,397
"dribbles with burning liquid that blackens the
ground it touches. The gaps between scales appear

1433
01:41:17,397 --> 01:41:21,737
"to flare bright with each breath, like a star
engine beneath the scales."

1434
01:41:21,737 --> 01:41:25,210
MARISHA: (sneezes) Sorry.

1435
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:26,405
LAURA: Bless you.

1436
01:41:26,405 --> 01:41:28,177
MARISHA: Yeah. Sorry.

1437
01:41:28,177 --> 01:41:30,284
LAURA: Do you think it's overtaking him?

1438
01:41:30,284 --> 01:41:44,158
MATT: "I've no idea. Allura?" And Allura goes,
"Well, if the anchor was indeed removed from the

1439
01:41:44,158 --> 01:41:52,779
"Fire Elemental Plane, then Thordak would have had
his soul torn from his body. That is how the

1440
01:41:52,779 --> 01:41:54,931
"anchor worked."

1441
01:41:54,931 --> 01:41:58,516
MARISHA: So you don't think he actually even fully
separated from the plane, he brought the plane

1442
01:41:58,516 --> 01:42:00,093
with him.

1443
01:42:00,093 --> 01:42:05,373
MATT: "Or at least, maybe a piece. I wasn't there,
I don't know the ritual that brought him over."

1444
01:42:05,373 --> 01:42:09,929
MARISHA: Maybe then we're looking at this the
wrong way. Maybe we go at this through the Fire

1445
01:42:09,929 --> 01:42:12,033
Plane. Maybe there's something still there.

1446
01:42:12,033 --> 01:42:14,286
TALIESIN: A way to sever his connection to the
Fire Plane, maybe.

1447
01:42:14,286 --> 01:42:15,864
MARISHA: Yeah.

1448
01:42:15,864 --> 01:42:17,675
MATT: Allura thinks for a second.

1449
01:42:17,675 --> 01:42:21,473
MARISHA: We've got an easy door in.

1450
01:42:21,473 --> 01:42:31,316
MATT: "I could try. But the enchantment itself--
We don't have enough information. It wasn't bound

1451
01:42:31,316 --> 01:42:36,982
"to a specific place in the plane, it was bound to
the plane itself. I don't know how you'd sever it

1452
01:42:36,982 --> 01:42:39,192
"from the other side."

1453
01:42:39,192 --> 01:42:44,161
TRAVIS: From the other side, we'd have to go
there.

1454
01:42:44,161 --> 01:42:45,124
SAM: Yeah.

1455
01:42:45,124 --> 01:42:46,955
TRAVIS: That's called thinking outside the
circle.

1456
01:42:46,955 --> 01:42:49,220
SAM: But then once we're there, what do we do?

1457
01:42:49,220 --> 01:42:54,242
MARISHA: And we don't even know where to look. I
mean, we could at least talk to the Ashari there.

1458
01:42:54,242 --> 01:42:55,637
They might--

1459
01:42:55,637 --> 01:42:56,848
TALIESIN: Another ally.

1460
01:42:56,848 --> 01:42:59,908
TRAVIS: Is there like nothing friendly in the Fire
Plane?

1461
01:42:59,908 --> 01:43:02,812
LIAM: It's at least as big as Tal'Dorei. I mean,
it's another dimension.

1462
01:43:02,812 --> 01:43:03,956
LAURA: It's huge.

1463
01:43:03,956 --> 01:43:07,698
MARISHA: It's huge, but not many people know the
whereabouts. There's still locations and

1464
01:43:07,698 --> 01:43:12,317
destinations within the Fire Plane. It's
navigable.

1465
01:43:12,317 --> 01:43:16,817
LAURA: Maybe all the evil things in the Fire Plane
are gone right now and they're with Thordak.

1466
01:43:16,817 --> 01:43:22,845
MATT: Asum steps forward to the table, and puts
his little halfling hands on the edge and goes,

1467
01:43:22,845 --> 01:43:29,615
"Well, it's a shame that we don't have any
information about this ritual that freed him from

1468
01:43:29,615 --> 01:43:30,922
"the plane."

1469
01:43:30,922 --> 01:43:36,004
LAURA: That is a shame. A real shame.

1470
01:43:36,004 --> 01:43:42,888
MATT: "I'll see if my compatriots can gather
information, but in the meantime we'll do the best

1471
01:43:42,888 --> 01:43:45,253
"we can to gather similar information."

1472
01:43:45,253 --> 01:43:51,399
LIAM: Well, we know we don't have a lot of time,
but do we maybe want to table this and think on it?

1473
01:43:51,399 --> 01:43:56,434
SAM: At the very least, should we send out some
letters, alerting our allies that--

1474
01:43:56,434 --> 01:43:57,819
LAURA: Shit's going down.

1475
01:43:57,819 --> 01:44:02,830
SAM: It's time to start stocking up and getting
ready to move?

1476
01:44:02,830 --> 01:44:06,654
MATT: Drake steps forward and goes, "I think
that's a fine plan of action. Reach out to all

1477
01:44:06,654 --> 01:44:10,388
"those you brought in. Hopefully we can get a few
of our friends in this as well."

1478
01:44:10,388 --> 01:44:14,356
LAURA: Did an airship ever arrive?

1479
01:44:14,356 --> 01:44:20,221
MATT: They all look at each other, a bit confused.
"No."

1480
01:44:20,221 --> 01:44:23,264
LAURA: An airship? Did anyone see an airship
flying around?

1481
01:44:23,264 --> 01:44:27,035
MATT: "I didn't see one." And Cassandra goes, "No.
There hasn't been an airship here, no. Are we

1482
01:44:27,035 --> 01:44:28,238
"expecting one?"

1483
01:44:28,238 --> 01:44:29,600
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

1484
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:30,747
MATT: "Good to know."

1485
01:44:30,747 --> 01:44:32,527
SAM: The city is invisible.

1486
01:44:32,527 --> 01:44:36,822
MATT: "Yes, so they won't see us if they come. If
we see an airship, do you wish us to flag it down?"

1487
01:44:36,822 --> 01:44:37,851
LAURA: That would be good.

1488
01:44:37,851 --> 01:44:38,842
MATT: "You trust it?"

1489
01:44:38,842 --> 01:44:39,796
LAURA: Yes.

1490
01:44:39,796 --> 01:44:41,227
LIAM: They are a rarity.

1491
01:44:41,227 --> 01:44:42,588
MATT: "All right."

1492
01:44:42,588 --> 01:44:45,384
SAM: Maybe come up with a landing point as well.

1493
01:44:45,384 --> 01:44:47,753
MATT: "Now?"

1494
01:44:47,753 --> 01:44:51,992
SAM: Well, soon.

1495
01:44:51,992 --> 01:44:59,317
TALIESIN: We have one other possible option in
front of us. Show them the medal.

1496
01:44:59,317 --> 01:45:02,800
SAM: No, thank you.

1497
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:07,189
TALIESIN: You're not going to show them the medal?
Not that, no! No, not that. Please don't whip that

1498
01:45:07,189 --> 01:45:08,559
out, no one wants to see that.

1499
01:45:08,559 --> 01:45:09,727
SAM: No, not the cube.

1500
01:45:09,727 --> 01:45:13,836
TALIESIN: We have another ally that we have spoken
of.

1501
01:45:13,836 --> 01:45:20,453
SAM: It's a tenuous ally at best. Maybe we
shouldn't discuss it until we're 100% sure about it.

1502
01:45:20,453 --> 01:45:26,922
LIAM: Yeah, that's a big maybe. That's a big
maybe. Yeah.

1503
01:45:26,922 --> 01:45:31,979
MARISHA: Yeah, they're very busy though.

1504
01:45:31,979 --> 01:45:39,727
LAURA: Yeah, it's really far away and, then as we
were leaving, the people that we talked to about it--

1505
01:45:39,727 --> 01:45:43,988
MATT: "It's fine, I get it! Reach out to your
people on one end."

1506
01:45:43,988 --> 01:45:51,505
TALIESIN: I slowly walk around the table, thinking
hard about it.

1507
01:45:51,505 --> 01:45:57,180
And I stab Seeker Asum three times
in the back with my sword.

1508
01:45:57,180 --> 01:46:02,269
MARISHA: Let's fucking do this shit! Let's do it!
Let's do it!

1509
01:46:02,269 --> 01:46:05,249
LAURA: But we need to know the ritual!

1510
01:46:05,249 --> 01:46:07,089
LIAM: It's too late, he did it.

1511
01:46:07,089 --> 01:46:08,768
MARISHA: (yelling) Yeah!

1512
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:10,276
SAM: Oh Percy, no.

1513
01:46:10,276 --> 01:46:12,480
MATT: Go ahead and roll--

1514
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:14,242
TALIESIN: That's a surprise attack.

1515
01:46:14,242 --> 01:46:15,403
MATT: I know it is.

1516
01:46:15,403 --> 01:46:20,788
SAM: Oh god, why? We're in crazy costumes.

1517
01:46:20,788 --> 01:46:22,126
LIAM: Check out the brain on Brad.

1518
01:46:22,126 --> 01:46:26,592
LAURA: We've got Allura and Gilmore, and Drake.

1519
01:46:26,592 --> 01:46:28,892
TALIESIN: We have a lot of people in the room.

1520
01:46:28,892 --> 01:46:30,298
SAM: Oh god.

1521
01:46:30,298 --> 01:46:36,116
MATT: Go ahead and roll. Roll the first attack.
With advantage.

1522
01:46:36,116 --> 01:46:37,773
TRAVIS: We're in a room.

1523
01:46:37,773 --> 01:46:40,485
LAURA: Whitestone's about to be destroyed.

1524
01:46:40,485 --> 01:46:42,535
SAM: And Raishan's about to leave.

1525
01:46:42,535 --> 01:46:44,631
LIAM: Oh man, he's not making you roll stealth,
motherfucker.

1526
01:46:44,631 --> 01:46:46,143
LAURA: Why would he? He doesn't--

1527
01:46:46,143 --> 01:46:48,867
LIAM: Because I would. And Hotis did on me.

1528
01:46:48,867 --> 01:46:50,923
LAURA: That's different.

1529
01:46:50,923 --> 01:46:52,185
LIAM: No it's not.

1530
01:46:52,185 --> 01:46:55,840
TALIESIN: That's 29.

1531
01:46:55,840 --> 01:47:07,492
MATT: Okay. As you pull the blade out of the hilt
to go ahead and begin to strike-- You're a quick

1532
01:47:07,492 --> 01:47:18,195
individual. You're also in the presence of an
entity that does not trust anyone or anything. You

1533
01:47:18,195 --> 01:47:28,794
take the blade and swing out in the direction of
Seeker Asum. And where your blade strikes, it

1534
01:47:28,794 --> 01:47:34,905
shimmers through the image. There's a flash, and
Asum is suddenly four feet away from the position

1535
01:47:34,905 --> 01:47:41,075
where Asum was standing. At which point, everyone
in the room stands up immediately and is like,

1536
01:47:41,075 --> 01:47:46,495
"Whoa whoa!" Cassandra goes over and puts her hand
towards you, and Asum is taking a few steps back

1537
01:47:46,495 --> 01:47:49,072
and is like (breathes heavily).

1538
01:47:49,072 --> 01:47:59,994
TALIESIN: No tricks in here. No tricks in here, if
we're really going to do this.

1539
01:47:59,994 --> 01:48:07,364
MATT: There's this moment of extreme quiet,
tension, as Allura's looking at you, looking at

1540
01:48:07,364 --> 01:48:12,885
Asum, looking around. And there's like this slow,
connecting moment of realization throughout the

1541
01:48:12,885 --> 01:48:15,523
room as everyone's eyes go wide.

1542
01:48:15,523 --> 01:48:21,338
TALIESIN: If we're really going to do this, no
tricks in here.

1543
01:48:21,338 --> 01:48:25,692
MATT: And with that, we're going to take a break.

1544
01:48:25,692 --> 01:48:29,298
(screaming)

1545
01:48:29,298 --> 01:48:30,558
MARISHA: Amazing!

1546
01:48:30,558 --> 01:48:31,698
LAURA: Taliesin!

1547
01:48:31,698 --> 01:48:37,484
TALIESIN: Don't trust a man who just kissed
somebody! That's a man who's saying fuck it.

1548
01:48:37,484 --> 01:48:39,824
LIAM: Backpedal, backpedal, backpedal!

1549
01:48:39,824 --> 01:48:41,976
MARISHA: I'm into it. I'm really into it.

1550
01:48:41,976 --> 01:48:44,309
LIAM: Yes, we know, darling. We know.

1551
01:48:44,309 --> 01:48:48,801
MATT: All righty. Well, we'll go ahead and take a
short break here, guys. We'll be back here in a

1552
01:48:48,801 --> 01:48:53,620
few minutes. And we'll (Victor voice) see what
happens next! (normal voice) All right. See you

1553
01:48:53,620 --> 01:48:55,223
guys here in a minute.

1554
01:48:55,223 --> 02:07:57,508
[break]

1555
02:07:57,508 --> 02:08:03,431
MATT: Welcome back, everyone, to Critical Role.
When we last left off, Clarota, over here-- Let us

1556
02:08:03,431 --> 02:08:05,061
all marvel at that!

1557
02:08:05,061 --> 02:08:06,649
(cheering)

1558
02:08:06,649 --> 02:08:08,726
TALIESIN: It was me all along!

1559
02:08:08,726 --> 02:08:12,440
LAURA: Oh god. Are you going to leave that on the
whole time?

1560
02:08:12,440 --> 02:08:14,352
TALIESIN: Oh hell no! I can't see or hear a
thing.

1561
02:08:14,352 --> 02:08:16,633
MARISHA: It was so short-lived.

1562
02:08:16,633 --> 02:08:18,642
LIAM: Three seconds of costume, that's all you
get!

1563
02:08:18,642 --> 02:08:21,211
(laughter)

1564
02:08:21,211 --> 02:08:22,810
SAM: You can't put just this part on?

1565
02:08:22,810 --> 02:08:24,090
TALIESIN: No, it's really uncomfortable!

1566
02:08:24,090 --> 02:08:25,511
LAURA: Just the helmet?

1567
02:08:25,511 --> 02:08:28,439
LIAM: Do the frigging helmet. I had my arm behind
my back for two hours!

1568
02:08:28,439 --> 02:08:29,667
TALIESIN: Why would you do that?

1569
02:08:29,667 --> 02:08:31,001
LIAM: Commitment!

1570
02:08:31,001 --> 02:08:34,094
MARISHA: I have so many guns in my belt! No one
can even see them, and I'm still committed.

1571
02:08:34,094 --> 02:08:35,979
SAM: I painted my entire body.

1572
02:08:35,979 --> 02:08:38,438
TALIESIN: What is wrong with you people?

1573
02:08:38,438 --> 02:08:40,017
LAURA: That's good. You're good now.

1574
02:08:40,017 --> 02:08:46,414
TALIESIN: I can't really claim sanity. I just did
something mind-bendingly stupid.

1575
02:08:46,414 --> 02:08:48,527
LIAM: You now look like one of your own bullets.

1576
02:08:48,527 --> 02:08:50,814
(laughter)

1577
02:08:50,814 --> 02:08:53,698
MATT: You have a very Merlin from Excalibur thing
going on there right now.

1578
02:08:53,698 --> 02:08:57,193
TALIESIN: A dream to some, a nightmare to others.

1579
02:08:57,193 --> 02:08:59,331
(laughter)

1580
02:08:59,331 --> 02:09:03,039
TALIESIN: Oh, like lightning! Yes!

1581
02:09:03,039 --> 02:09:08,855
MATT: We need more green lights in here to really
get the effect.

1582
02:09:08,855 --> 02:09:10,803
TALIESIN: Go see Excalibur. Not right now, but
tomorrow.

1583
02:09:10,803 --> 02:09:15,334
MATT: All right! So, bringing it back in. As your
blade swings through and passes through the form

1584
02:09:15,334 --> 02:09:21,442
of Seeker Asum, it shimmers and then darts
backward into the corner of the room.

1585
02:09:21,442 --> 02:09:27,494
TALIESIN: I immediately sheath and say: No more
tricks. If we're going to do this, we need

1586
02:09:27,494 --> 02:09:29,525
everybody to know what's on the table.

1587
02:09:29,525 --> 02:09:36,517
MATT: At which point, everyone who stood up and
held off at the chaos, you see all the faces going

1588
02:09:36,517 --> 02:09:43,013
off in realization. Asum goes from a defensive
position and then stands up again. Crosses the arms.

1589
02:09:43,013 --> 02:09:51,075
TALIESIN: We're either going to win, or we're not.
I was hoping you were going to take care of that.

1590
02:09:51,075 --> 02:10:01,377
MATT: "We're working on that plan as we speak. But
pardon me if I take a few-- how do you say--

1591
02:10:01,377 --> 02:10:11,231
"<i>careful</i> backups in case one would take a blade
and stab at an ally, supposedly."

1592
02:10:11,231 --> 02:10:16,660
TALIESIN: You know damn well that we're not
allies. You know damn well that this is a tenuous

1593
02:10:16,660 --> 02:10:20,576
relationship. And you know that neither of us
trust the other.

1594
02:10:20,576 --> 02:10:27,783
MATT: At which point, Allura puts her hand out and
goes, "I'm sorry. What the hell is going on here?!"

1595
02:10:27,783 --> 02:10:37,451
TALIESIN: We'll get there. I would hope that you
wouldn't trust us, and I would hope that you

1596
02:10:37,451 --> 02:10:43,010
understand that we don't trust you. But we need to
make a real plan now.

1597
02:10:43,010 --> 02:10:56,752
MATT: As the tension slowly subsides, Gilmore puts
his finger up, "Pardon my momentary ignorance.

1598
02:10:56,752 --> 02:11:00,298
"Would you like me to cleanse the room?"

1599
02:11:00,298 --> 02:11:10,155
TALIESIN: I'm hoping for a conversation to start
that I promised I wouldn't start myself. I am

1600
02:11:10,155 --> 02:11:13,247
trying to keep to the letter of my word.

1601
02:11:13,247 --> 02:11:21,408
SAM: It might help if Gilmore were to make sure
everyone is on the up-and-up in this room.

1602
02:11:21,408 --> 02:11:25,209
TALIESIN: Seeker Asum, do you have an opinion on
how you would like to proceed?

1603
02:11:25,209 --> 02:11:36,481
MATT: Seeker Asum takes a few steps towards you.
Casually looks up to you and goes to pat you on

1604
02:11:36,481 --> 02:11:43,172
the shoulder. His illusory hand passing through
your form. Goes, "I'm quite comfortable where I am

1605
02:11:43,172 --> 02:11:45,888
"right now. Let us continue this conversation."

1606
02:11:45,888 --> 02:11:54,534
TALIESIN: The floor is yours if you wish to tell
everyone what the real plan is.

1607
02:11:54,534 --> 02:12:05,860
MATT: "Very well! Since my hand has been forced.
Hello. Seeker Asum is still back in Emon, dealing

1608
02:12:05,860 --> 02:12:16,605
"with the difficulty of preparing the current
circumstance we're discussing. I am Raishan.

1609
02:12:16,605 --> 02:12:25,737
"Member of the Conclave. Up until recently, tenuous
ally with Thordak the Cinder King, who is now

1610
02:12:25,737 --> 02:12:38,843
"considered a mutual thorn in all of our sides.
I've made an agreement with your Vox Machina for

1611
02:12:38,843 --> 02:12:48,399
"quite some time. Together, using our combined
strengths, we slew Vorugal, the Frigid Doom, over

1612
02:12:48,399 --> 02:12:56,104
"in Wildemount. We've returned to reconvene. I've
provided nothing but honest, upfront, and

1613
02:12:56,104 --> 02:12:59,514
"necessarily vital information to your victory."

1614
02:12:59,514 --> 02:13:06,789
TALIESIN: I will confirm everything but "for quite
some time" to the room.

1615
02:13:06,789 --> 02:13:11,454
LAURA: I've just been staring at Allura.

1616
02:13:11,454 --> 02:13:19,470
MATT: Allura, you see her fingers are twitching
and her arms tense, and there's this very faint

1617
02:13:19,470 --> 02:13:26,103
air that's blowing her hair ever so slightly,
where there's no wind in the air. She's on edge

1618
02:13:26,103 --> 02:13:29,304
right now and is looking to you guys for guidance,
like "Are we doing this?"

1619
02:13:29,304 --> 02:13:37,566
Cassandra stood up immediately. For the first time
in a long time, since Whitestone was reclaimed,

1620
02:13:37,566 --> 02:13:44,049
Cassandra now resembles more her age than she ever
did. She has a look on her face like she's far out

1621
02:13:44,049 --> 02:13:48,306
of her depth. Understanding the circumstance,
there's legitimate fear in her face, and she's

1622
02:13:48,306 --> 02:13:53,828
looking at Percival with that look of, "What have
you done?"

1623
02:13:53,828 --> 02:13:59,205
TALIESIN: Now we can have a real conversation
about what's going on. We have an ally on the

1624
02:13:59,205 --> 02:14:07,401
inside, albeit an untrustworthy one. You'll pardon
that, but there's every possibility that this is

1625
02:14:07,401 --> 02:14:17,997
an elaborate trap. I respect your intelligence far
too much to try and pretend otherwise. You

1626
02:14:17,997 --> 02:14:25,021
understand certainly what I mean? Having this on
the table, we now know that there's every

1627
02:14:25,021 --> 02:14:31,666
possibility that the red dragon knows everything.
There's every possibility that we're walking into

1628
02:14:31,666 --> 02:14:41,024
a trap. Or there's every possibility that we have
an insatiably powerful ally. It is a terrible risk.

1629
02:14:41,024 --> 02:14:43,482
MARISHA: Or an insatiably powerful enemy.

1630
02:14:43,482 --> 02:14:46,452
TALIESIN: Also a terrible risk.

1631
02:14:46,452 --> 02:14:52,191
LAURA: Either way, we can now ask about the
ritual.

1632
02:14:52,191 --> 02:15:02,894
MARISHA: Why don't you inform the room on how you
utilized an entire race of people to break the ritual?

1633
02:15:02,894 --> 02:15:11,608
MATT: Everyone's still standing at this point,
looking. Cassandra slowly sits down but is still

1634
02:15:11,608 --> 02:15:22,675
looking between Raishan and Percival. You watch as
Asum's form steps towards the center of the room,

1635
02:15:22,675 --> 02:15:37,527
the flash of green flaring in the eyes with a
smile, "The anchor that you speak of was indeed

1636
02:15:37,527 --> 02:15:46,979
"removed from the Fire Elemental Plane. We
discovered that it was indestructible. Good on

1637
02:15:46,979 --> 02:15:55,017
"you, Allura. Well created. We tried many different
ways: rending it, crushing it, sending it

1638
02:15:55,017 --> 02:16:05,102
"elsewhere without the enchantment tearing Thordak
with it. To no avail. In trying to find a way to

1639
02:16:05,102 --> 02:16:14,409
"bring Thordak through, we needed to bring the soul
anchor and the Fire Elemental Plane with it. The

1640
02:16:14,409 --> 02:16:25,912
"one place where such research could be gathered
promptly, fully, was Pyrah. Now, mind you, it was

1641
02:16:25,912 --> 02:16:31,375
"not my intent for such destruction to rain upon
them. I spent many years with them. I got to know

1642
02:16:31,375 --> 02:16:40,427
"them. They're a fine people. In that time, I
learned the ways of temporal travel between

1643
02:16:40,427 --> 02:16:47,607
"dimensions. The details that allowed me to see the
fabric of the Fire Plane, to where we could encase

1644
02:16:47,607 --> 02:16:57,255
"a bit of it within the soul anchor itself. Once we
had managed to crack that essence, I was able to,

1645
02:16:57,255 --> 02:17:04,648
"from a distance, using the allies at the other
end-- Thordak had found friendship with some of the

1646
02:17:04,648 --> 02:17:10,571
"ousted fire giants. They found comfort outside of
the ordning under the shadow of the fire dragon.

1647
02:17:10,571 --> 02:17:18,400
"In using their deep, rich-blooded past and forging
and making, they were able to convert the soul

1648
02:17:18,400 --> 02:17:27,247
"anchor into something that housed the essence of
the Fire Plane. However, we didn't have a means of

1649
02:17:27,247 --> 02:17:34,164
"creating a hole large enough to bring both through
without destroying both in the process. And as

1650
02:17:34,164 --> 02:17:39,847
"such, we waited for the right time: The Winter's
Crest."

1651
02:17:39,847 --> 02:17:42,912
MARISHA: You bitch.

1652
02:17:42,912 --> 02:17:55,726
MATT: "To some, maybe. But we called this the
Ember Seed. The Ember Seed resides in the center

1653
02:17:55,726 --> 02:18:02,228
"of this heartstone. That is what is causing
Thordak to swell. That is what's driving him mad.

1654
02:18:02,228 --> 02:18:12,168
"That is what is drawing the very land around Emon
to fiery eruption. It is also what keeps his soul

1655
02:18:12,168 --> 02:18:13,501
"on this plane."

1656
02:18:13,501 --> 02:18:17,359
TRAVIS: What keeps his soul on <i>this</i> plane?

1657
02:18:17,359 --> 02:18:19,738
MATT: "It keeps the soul intact with his body."

1658
02:18:19,738 --> 02:18:22,026
TRAVIS: Destroy the stone...

1659
02:18:22,026 --> 02:18:25,444
TALIESIN: It can't be destroyed.

1660
02:18:25,444 --> 02:18:28,376
MATT: "In theory. But we've tried. Believe me;
we've tried."

1661
02:18:28,376 --> 02:18:34,384
MARISHA: And you kept the soul and the stone
inside of him?

1662
02:18:34,384 --> 02:18:45,509
MATT: "To remove it would destroy him as well, as
the Arcana Pansophical saw fit. So yes, both came

1663
02:18:45,509 --> 02:18:52,127
"through. Waited for the Winter's Crest, had enough
power and understanding of the ritual to open the

1664
02:18:52,127 --> 02:18:58,882
"entirety of the tear, and Thordak screamed
through, flames in his wake. And <i>he</i> laid waste

1665
02:18:58,882 --> 02:19:00,808
"to your people, not I."

1666
02:19:00,808 --> 02:19:14,102
MARISHA: No. You used me. You used us. And my fear
that I had originally appears to be true. A lot of

1667
02:19:14,102 --> 02:19:28,195
this is my fault. I'm willing to accept my onus.
The fact that you can't shows all the kind of

1668
02:19:28,195 --> 02:19:40,649
person that you are. My promise still stands. I'm
thinking it might come sooner rather than later.

1669
02:19:40,649 --> 02:19:55,336
MATT: "You do understand that without my aid, you
will not succeed?"

1670
02:19:55,336 --> 02:20:02,973
MARISHA: I understand that without your aid, none
of this would have fucking happened in the first place.

1671
02:20:02,973 --> 02:20:07,603
MATT: "Yes, and there are quite a few in this room
that fall in that category." She looks to Allura

1672
02:20:07,603 --> 02:20:09,230
and Drake.

1673
02:20:09,230 --> 02:20:16,618
MARISHA: So it seems all of us can accept our part
in this matter, except for you.

1674
02:20:16,618 --> 02:20:23,755
MATT: "I accept my part in this matter as well.
You don't think I feel duped by this? You don't

1675
02:20:23,755 --> 02:20:33,285
"think I have many things I wish to tear from the
very corpse of that entity? You think I don't want

1676
02:20:33,285 --> 02:20:37,997
"to see him burn as much as you do? This vengeance
that burns within me!"

1677
02:20:37,997 --> 02:20:44,512
MARISHA: What would you do if you actually got
what you want?

1678
02:20:44,512 --> 02:20:50,984
MATT: "What all of us want: freedom."

1679
02:20:50,984 --> 02:21:03,739
MARISHA: I pull out the Spire of Conflux. There
are always many solutions to many problems. You

1680
02:21:03,739 --> 02:21:15,524
think Thordak is the only solution to yours? This
staff was birthed from the head of Melora, the

1681
02:21:15,524 --> 02:21:30,405
same goddess who gave you that curse. What if you
wanted me instead? Me and this staff. Maybe I can

1682
02:21:30,405 --> 02:21:32,868
help you more than Thordak can.

1683
02:21:32,868 --> 02:21:40,203
MATT: "Are you saying you understand the way to
remove this? That you know the secret to burning

1684
02:21:40,203 --> 02:21:44,622
"this wretched disease from my form?"

1685
02:21:44,622 --> 02:21:51,483
MARISHA: I'm saying <i>I</i> might be your best chance
at salvation. I'm pretty sure this staff is the

1686
02:21:51,483 --> 02:22:01,160
closest living relic that we have in existence to
the god who granted your curse. Thordak is no god.

1687
02:22:01,160 --> 02:22:04,099
That was your first <i>stupid</i> mistake.

1688
02:22:04,099 --> 02:22:25,949
TALIESIN: I think if I might translate. What my
friend here is trying to relate is that, perhaps

1689
02:22:25,949 --> 02:22:34,237
when the dust has settled, your salvation may
either be found in the withering corpse or

1690
02:22:34,237 --> 02:22:41,601
cackling smile of a creature that you are
subservient to, who will take great delight in

1691
02:22:41,601 --> 02:22:49,288
your destruction. Or perhaps in those you've aided
who will feel grateful.

1692
02:22:49,288 --> 02:22:52,291
MARISHA: It's up to you, Raishan.

1693
02:22:52,291 --> 02:22:59,615
TALIESIN: And I will advise her to take no revenge
until all cards are on the table.

1694
02:22:59,615 --> 02:23:02,589
MATT: "Well. Good."

1695
02:23:02,589 --> 02:23:12,960
MARISHA: Clearly you are the type of person who
looks for answers in other people. You are clearly

1696
02:23:12,960 --> 02:23:21,503
unaware of accepting any fault or any result of
your actions. Why don't you start fresh? Do you

1697
02:23:21,503 --> 02:23:29,801
really want Thordak to have another sway over you?
Another gift, another favor, that he's given you?

1698
02:23:29,801 --> 02:23:37,014
That he is going to hold over you for all of
eternity? Do you really want that? You're stronger

1699
02:23:37,014 --> 02:23:38,645
than that.

1700
02:23:38,645 --> 02:23:42,142
MATT: "That's why we're working to watch him
fall."

1701
02:23:42,142 --> 02:23:43,827
MARISHA: Are we?

1702
02:23:43,827 --> 02:23:49,152
MATT: (chuckles) "If you need not my help, just
let me know."

1703
02:23:49,152 --> 02:24:00,057
MARISHA: Oh no, Raishan. We don't need your help.
Let me say that right now. This all depends on

1704
02:24:00,057 --> 02:24:03,150
what you want out of the end of the deal.

1705
02:24:03,150 --> 02:24:19,765
MATT: "I wish to be given unfettered, unbothered,
unwatched control over the corpse upon his death

1706
02:24:19,765 --> 02:24:33,204
"to extract the information I need. I will leave
your very sphere of existence and understanding

1707
02:24:33,204 --> 02:24:35,267
"until the end of your days."

1708
02:24:35,267 --> 02:24:37,225
LIAM: What happens if we say no to that?

1709
02:24:37,225 --> 02:24:39,528
MATT: "Oh, then I'll find another way."

1710
02:24:39,528 --> 02:24:41,451
MARISHA: Spoiler alert: we're saying no to that.

1711
02:24:41,451 --> 02:24:45,783
TALIESIN: Unfettered I'm fine with. It's
unwatched--

1712
02:24:45,783 --> 02:24:51,840
MATT: "Then watch! Watch, for all I care. It will
be Greek to you anyway."

1713
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:57,497
MARISHA: She's taken way too much. She doesn't get
to leave!

1714
02:24:57,497 --> 02:25:00,067
TALIESIN: She's already left.

1715
02:25:00,067 --> 02:25:06,972
TRAVIS: Yeah, I walk over around the table towards
Asum. I try and poke her in the shoulder. Him.

1716
02:25:06,972 --> 02:25:09,259
MATT: It passes through the form.

1717
02:25:09,259 --> 02:25:15,128
TALIESIN: This is the deal that we are offered.
This is the deal that's on the table. We are in a

1718
02:25:15,128 --> 02:25:17,000
tenuous position of power.

1719
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,088
SAM: You can stop poking, Grog.

1720
02:25:19,088 --> 02:25:21,435
TRAVIS: She's not here!

1721
02:25:21,435 --> 02:25:23,774
LAURA: That's crazy.

1722
02:25:23,774 --> 02:25:25,616
SAM: Give her one more good poke.

1723
02:25:25,616 --> 02:25:31,940
TALIESIN: How do we get in contact with you when
we know when we move and how?

1724
02:25:31,940 --> 02:25:41,032
MATT: "Well, what is your next step through your
journey?"

1725
02:25:41,032 --> 02:25:49,869
TALIESIN: That is the question. Now that
everything's on the table, I'm sorry to shock

1726
02:25:49,869 --> 02:25:58,787
everyone. I was hoping not to be the cause of it.
I was hoping that it was time for everything to be

1727
02:25:58,787 --> 02:26:06,495
on the table. But this is actually what we're
dealing with. This is the complexity. This is the

1728
02:26:06,495 --> 02:26:08,402
battlefield.

1729
02:26:08,402 --> 02:26:13,950
TRAVIS: So we have to rally our forces to us, and
we have to do some really smart recon. Do we make

1730
02:26:13,950 --> 02:26:15,290
her a part of that or no?

1731
02:26:15,290 --> 02:26:21,512
TALIESIN: No, the more distance that we keep, the
better.

1732
02:26:21,512 --> 02:26:24,288
SAM: From her?

1733
02:26:24,288 --> 02:26:34,816
TALIESIN: Yes. She will probably be, I imagine, in
our way on occasion.

1734
02:26:34,816 --> 02:26:39,622
LIAM: But no one make any mistake. She's lying to
our faces. She is not telling us what she wants or

1735
02:26:39,622 --> 02:26:42,675
what she wants to do. You have a whole plan!

1736
02:26:42,675 --> 02:26:44,121
MATT: "Assume what you will."

1737
02:26:44,121 --> 02:26:50,343
LIAM: Shut the fuck up! You've been droning on for
an hour! Shut the fuck up. You're not telling us

1738
02:26:50,343 --> 02:26:54,814
what you want. You fucking shit bag. Fuck you!

1739
02:26:54,814 --> 02:26:57,636
MATT: "Keep great company."

1740
02:26:57,636 --> 02:27:03,124
LIAM: Does anyone really believe that this is all
going to be fixed if we work with her?

1741
02:27:03,124 --> 02:27:13,288
MARISHA: I say we take a recess. Gather our
thoughts. Raishan, my offer still stands. If you

1742
02:27:13,288 --> 02:27:20,665
want to come and find me, I know you know how.
Maybe we can commune with Melora together.

1743
02:27:20,665 --> 02:27:34,181
MATT: "You do not comprehend the magics that you
even speak of. It's cute. Look, I agree. Distance

1744
02:27:34,181 --> 02:27:40,950
"is of aid to us at the moment. If anything, I
should probably cut off the information of

1745
02:27:40,950 --> 02:27:47,671
"Vorugal's fall. I should speak with the Cinder
King and still establish my allegiance from his

1746
02:27:47,671 --> 02:27:49,712
"perspective."

1747
02:27:49,712 --> 02:27:55,130
TALIESIN: Can you cut off that information? I
would imagine that would be far too much.

1748
02:27:55,130 --> 02:28:03,827
MATT: "Cut it off, no. But I can attempt to guide
the fury, if you will."

1749
02:28:03,827 --> 02:28:07,072
LAURA: Will he know it was us?

1750
02:28:07,072 --> 02:28:09,462
MATT: "I can guarantee it."

1751
02:28:09,462 --> 02:28:12,327
TRAVIS: Can you keep him from attacking
Whitestone?

1752
02:28:12,327 --> 02:28:15,293
MATT: "For a time, maybe."

1753
02:28:15,293 --> 02:28:20,392
MARISHA: Can you guide his fury in a way that
would be beneficial to the plan?

1754
02:28:20,392 --> 02:28:23,249
MATT: "If I knew what the plan was, yes."

1755
02:28:23,249 --> 02:28:27,867
MARISHA: You were saying ideally, if we could get
him away?

1756
02:28:27,867 --> 02:28:30,420
TALIESIN: I don't think we're going to get him
away--

1757
02:28:30,420 --> 02:28:36,272
SAM: We're going to do recon. We're going to send
out word to gather our forces-- where?

1758
02:28:36,272 --> 02:28:37,921
TALIESIN: What if he knew where we were?

1759
02:28:37,921 --> 02:28:39,340
TRAVIS: We don't know yet.

1760
02:28:39,340 --> 02:28:41,018
SAM: Let's find out, let's pick a place.

1761
02:28:41,018 --> 02:28:54,450
TALIESIN: What if you knew where we were? What if
we found a place? We pick our battleground. He

1762
02:28:54,450 --> 02:28:55,994
discovers where we're hiding.

1763
02:28:55,994 --> 02:28:57,472
MARISHA: And Raishan rats us out.

1764
02:28:57,472 --> 02:29:00,151
TALIESIN: And Raishan discovers this information.

1765
02:29:00,151 --> 02:29:04,133
MARISHA: Would certainly put you in the good
graces of the Cinder King.

1766
02:29:04,133 --> 02:29:07,096
MATT: Raishan takes a moment and thinks.

1767
02:29:07,096 --> 02:29:10,879
TALIESIN: You are searching for us right now, are
you not?

1768
02:29:10,879 --> 02:29:15,507
MATT: "I am indeed, but Thordak has been using us
as the attack."

1769
02:29:15,507 --> 02:29:17,503
LIAM: Yeah, he's not going to leave his nest.

1770
02:29:17,503 --> 02:29:19,232
LAURA: So what if we kill you?

1771
02:29:19,232 --> 02:29:24,601
MATT: "What do you mean?"

1772
02:29:24,601 --> 02:29:28,213
LAURA: How does Thordak know you're alive?

1773
02:29:28,213 --> 02:29:31,239
MATT: "Because I check in every now and then to
remind him."

1774
02:29:31,239 --> 02:29:34,654
LAURA: What if he sends you out, and we kill you?

1775
02:29:34,654 --> 02:29:39,525
MARISHA: And you never come back? He'd be forced
to be the one to have to leave the battlefield.

1776
02:29:39,525 --> 02:29:41,828
TALIESIN: If he knew where you were headed.

1777
02:29:41,828 --> 02:29:50,949
MARISHA: You're a clever girl. I'm sure you can
make a ruse to make you look convincingly dead.

1778
02:29:50,949 --> 02:29:56,783
TALIESIN: You wouldn't even have to tell us where
you were hiding. You could just hide. And we could

1779
02:29:56,783 --> 02:30:00,092
ready ourselves.

1780
02:30:00,092 --> 02:30:15,198
MATT: "That is an idea. Hmm. Take your recess.
I'll take mine. There may be something to this plot."

1781
02:30:15,198 --> 02:30:23,387
MARISHA: And we can all assume that when we exit
this room, that our tenuous alliance is still

1782
02:30:23,387 --> 02:30:24,598
that. Correct?

1783
02:30:24,598 --> 02:30:30,858
MATT: "I would hope that there's no more errant
blade pokery?"

1784
02:30:30,858 --> 02:30:33,359
TALIESIN: Now that I know your tricks.

1785
02:30:33,359 --> 02:30:36,049
LAURA: We do it to everyone. Don't worry.

1786
02:30:36,049 --> 02:30:37,731
TALIESIN: We actually do, now that I think about
it.

1787
02:30:37,731 --> 02:30:38,999
MARISHA: Yeah, that's kind of true.

1788
02:30:38,999 --> 02:30:43,506
LIAM: We're also not alone here. Allura, how does
this sit with you?

1789
02:30:43,506 --> 02:30:47,853
MATT: Allura is sitting right now, she's listening
to everything with her hands crossed. Shakes her

1790
02:30:47,853 --> 02:31:00,186
head and goes, "To be perfectly honest, this
bothers me a great deal. But the fact that

1791
02:31:00,186 --> 02:31:02,963
"Whitestone still stands does speak volumes at the
least."

1792
02:31:02,963 --> 02:31:04,165
TALIESIN: It does.

1793
02:31:04,165 --> 02:31:08,038
MATT: "With the cards being in our favor."

1794
02:31:08,038 --> 02:31:11,531
TALIESIN: It's not the first devil I've made a
deal with.

1795
02:31:11,531 --> 02:31:12,931
MATT: "No."

1796
02:31:12,931 --> 02:31:15,306
LAURA: Doesn't always turn out well, Percival.

1797
02:31:15,306 --> 02:31:17,518
TALIESIN: Doesn't always turn out terribly,
either.

1798
02:31:17,518 --> 02:31:27,755
MATT: "Regardless, I have a lot to think about. As
do we all." And Allura slowly turns her head and

1799
02:31:27,755 --> 02:31:34,730
looks up, probably for the first time since she
sat down, to the illusory Raishan's Asum form.

1800
02:31:34,730 --> 02:31:52,649
"Asum lives, then?" "Indeed
he does. Indeed he does." And Allura turns her

1801
02:31:52,649 --> 02:31:53,977
head back and goes--

1802
02:31:53,977 --> 02:31:55,045
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check?

1803
02:31:55,045 --> 02:31:56,968
MATT: Go for it.

1804
02:31:56,968 --> 02:32:05,877
MARISHA: Does she know if Asum is up to something
no good? 25, I think? Better double check that. 25.

1805
02:32:05,877 --> 02:32:15,702
MATT: 25? Okay. It's hard to read the demeanor of
Raishan in general. It's this middle ground of

1806
02:32:15,702 --> 02:32:22,925
neutral expression with a half-cocked grin.
Information flows at this consistent rate of being

1807
02:32:22,925 --> 02:32:34,247
generally difficult to read. The beat of
hesitation is meant for emphasis, more than

1808
02:32:34,247 --> 02:32:43,197
covering, if that makes any sense. So it seems to
have an honesty to it, if you could read any

1809
02:32:43,197 --> 02:32:45,173
honesty from Raishan.

1810
02:32:45,173 --> 02:32:52,208
LAURA: Raishan, now that we know you're you, do
you have to continue the ruse of being Asum, or

1811
02:32:52,208 --> 02:32:54,508
can you bring him here?

1812
02:32:54,508 --> 02:33:00,857
MATT: "I can certainly bring him here if you'd
like. However, he is doing quite a lot of good

1813
02:33:00,857 --> 02:33:06,920
"with the Clasp, and Brom and Tofor
underneath Emon right now, and they've managed to

1814
02:33:06,920 --> 02:33:10,538
"save many lives and continue to do so."

1815
02:33:10,538 --> 02:33:13,724
LAURA: Maybe you could pop him over then? Just for
a little bit.

1816
02:33:13,724 --> 02:33:15,895
MATT: "Well--"

1817
02:33:15,895 --> 02:33:18,970
LAURA: You're quite powerful.

1818
02:33:18,970 --> 02:33:23,708
MATT: "What do you have need for Asum?"

1819
02:33:23,708 --> 02:33:29,623
LAURA: I want to hear what's going on with the
Clasp. I want to see for myself that he's alive.

1820
02:33:29,623 --> 02:33:33,025
TALIESIN: We're actually going to have to have a
conversation with the Clasp, because we're going

1821
02:33:33,025 --> 02:33:37,400
to purge the city once the dragon is gone.

1822
02:33:37,400 --> 02:33:38,977
MATT: "Why don't you go see him yourself?"

1823
02:33:38,977 --> 02:33:42,934
TRAVIS: No, I like her idea. I want to see him
here.

1824
02:33:42,934 --> 02:33:45,958
LIAM: Yeah. I feel a little better here. It would
go a long way to earning some trust.

1825
02:33:45,958 --> 02:33:52,178
MATT: "Well, make your choice. Either I intercept
and begin to work towards Thordak's ruse and set

1826
02:33:52,178 --> 02:34:00,944
"a space that convinces him perhaps I've fallen
into your hands, or I go retrieve your friend from

1827
02:34:00,944 --> 02:34:05,740
"Emon. I'm not your errand boy, and we have a
limited time here. Which is more important?"

1828
02:34:05,740 --> 02:34:11,417
TRAVIS: Sure you are. You are our errand boy. We
are your vessel to what it is you want. So get

1829
02:34:11,417 --> 02:34:17,870
busy, and do it quickly. After all, you're very
powerful. But that changes day by day, doesn't it?

1830
02:34:17,870 --> 02:34:28,183
MATT: "So, Emon it is. Very well. Back in a day."

1831
02:34:28,183 --> 02:34:35,470
TALIESIN: We will start figuring out and
discussing a place for the final battle. We will

1832
02:34:35,470 --> 02:34:43,944
find a place that is advantageous. Your input, if
you feel the urge to give it, is always welcome.

1833
02:34:43,944 --> 02:34:47,583
At least to me.

1834
02:34:47,583 --> 02:34:56,383
MATT: "It's going to be very difficult to pry the
Cinder King from his nest."

1835
02:34:56,383 --> 02:35:00,335
TALIESIN: Your supposed death will go far for
that.

1836
02:35:00,335 --> 02:35:03,616
MATT: "If anything, but I have no guarantees."

1837
02:35:03,616 --> 02:35:14,610
TALIESIN: As long as everything is on the up and
up, and as long as we do not catch you in deep

1838
02:35:14,610 --> 02:35:15,687
deceit.

1839
02:35:15,687 --> 02:35:18,256
LIAM: (whispers) Good luck with that.

1840
02:35:18,256 --> 02:35:26,523
TALIESIN: We will make sure that the plan moves in
the direction it is meant to.

1841
02:35:26,523 --> 02:35:30,636
MATT: "One day then."

1842
02:35:30,636 --> 02:35:32,672
TRAVIS: One day.

1843
02:35:32,672 --> 02:35:34,390
MATT: And the image (disappearing noise).

1844
02:35:34,390 --> 02:35:35,911
TALIESIN: He's going to send Asum to us.

1845
02:35:35,911 --> 02:35:45,259
TRAVIS: So Allura, so it's clear: Seeker Asum is
Raishan.

1846
02:35:45,259 --> 02:35:51,600
TALIESIN: And has been since Raishan's appearance
in Whitestone.

1847
02:35:51,600 --> 02:35:56,205
MARISHA: And we didn't know until 48 hours ago?
Tops?

1848
02:35:56,205 --> 02:35:59,888
TALIESIN: Now, can we maybe make sure that
everybody in the room is who they say they are?

1849
02:35:59,888 --> 02:36:03,776
SAM: Go stab everyone, Percy. One at a time.

1850
02:36:03,776 --> 02:36:07,831
MATT: As you say that, everyone pulls back from
the table.

1851
02:36:07,831 --> 02:36:13,027
LAURA: I'm a dragon too! (evil laugh)

1852
02:36:13,027 --> 02:36:15,325
LIAM: Hi. Larkin.

1853
02:36:15,325 --> 02:36:17,622
MATT: There he is!

1854
02:36:17,622 --> 02:36:21,586
TALIESIN: I apologize. I didn't know what else to
do.

1855
02:36:21,586 --> 02:36:23,649
LAURA: You thought you were going to stab him!

1856
02:36:23,649 --> 02:36:25,652
LIAM: Yes you did, Percival.

1857
02:36:25,652 --> 02:36:26,958
LAURA: That was not a play!

1858
02:36:26,958 --> 02:36:31,392
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's be real about it. "No tricks
in this room!"

1859
02:36:31,392 --> 02:36:32,911
LIAM: Yeah, you shifted gears very quickly there.

1860
02:36:32,911 --> 02:36:34,035
LAURA: No tricks.

1861
02:36:34,035 --> 02:36:35,400
TALIESIN: I've told no lies in this room.

1862
02:36:35,400 --> 02:36:36,469
LIAM: Uh-huh.

1863
02:36:36,469 --> 02:36:38,593
TRAVIS: (fake cough) Whiff!

1864
02:36:38,593 --> 02:36:52,421
TALIESIN: I tell that creature no lies. Ever. That
is a green dragon. There is no tricking it, there

1865
02:36:52,421 --> 02:36:56,651
is no deceiving it. There is just telling as much
truth as you can get away with.

1866
02:36:56,651 --> 02:37:02,627
MATT: As you're talking, you feel a tug on your
right arm. And you look over and you see

1867
02:37:02,627 --> 02:37:07,271
Cassandra, who has come over to your side and is
pulling on your sleeve with a very intense look in

1868
02:37:07,271 --> 02:37:21,094
her eye. She goes, "Percival. I can watch
Whitestone. I can get the people fed. I can keep

1869
02:37:21,094 --> 02:37:31,524
"the people armed. I can organize the day to day. I
can't keep it safe from that."

1870
02:37:31,524 --> 02:37:34,517
TALIESIN: Which is why I would ask everyone to
please not antagonize it.

1871
02:37:34,517 --> 02:37:41,729
MATT: "Percival. Percival! I don't know what you
dragged us into in this, but I need you to pull us

1872
02:37:41,729 --> 02:37:46,389
"out of it. I can't do this."

1873
02:37:46,389 --> 02:37:52,339
TALIESIN: I've moved the battle. That is the best
that I know how.

1874
02:37:52,339 --> 02:37:54,296
MATT: "How long have you known?"

1875
02:37:54,296 --> 02:37:55,882
TALIESIN: Two days.

1876
02:37:55,882 --> 02:37:57,324
LAURA: Not long, Cassandra.

1877
02:37:57,324 --> 02:37:58,507
TALIESIN: Two days.

1878
02:37:58,507 --> 02:37:59,859
SAM: Maybe three.

1879
02:37:59,859 --> 02:38:01,663
MARISHA: We were forced.

1880
02:38:01,663 --> 02:38:04,309
TALIESIN: The day before we left to kill the white
dragon.

1881
02:38:04,309 --> 02:38:06,447
SAM: There's a time difference.

1882
02:38:06,447 --> 02:38:09,685
LAURA: And if we had told any of you, your life
would have been in danger.

1883
02:38:09,685 --> 02:38:17,314
TALIESIN: This was the best way I knew to keep her
from destroying this city outright. This was the

1884
02:38:17,314 --> 02:38:23,348
best way that kept her from telling the red dragon
where we are. And the longer that we can keep her

1885
02:38:23,348 --> 02:38:26,855
a tenuous ally, the longer Whitestone will stand.

1886
02:38:26,855 --> 02:38:36,233
SAM: When she does come back with Asum, this plan
that we started in on-- it's a good one?

1887
02:38:36,233 --> 02:38:37,930
TALIESIN: I think so.

1888
02:38:37,930 --> 02:38:46,922
SAM: Well, we have Raishan convince Thordak that
we're amassing forces in Kymal or something.

1889
02:38:46,922 --> 02:38:53,211
Thordak sends Raishan to get us. We "kill"
Raishan.

1890
02:38:53,211 --> 02:38:54,525
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

1891
02:38:54,525 --> 02:38:58,486
SAM: And then Thordak comes to check on our dead
bodies?

1892
02:38:58,486 --> 02:39:01,629
TALIESIN: We send word of a dead dragon.

1893
02:39:01,629 --> 02:39:04,319
SAM: How can that plan fail?

1894
02:39:04,319 --> 02:39:09,422
LIAM: I mean, I'm not the only one who thinks
she's more dangerous than he is at this point.

1895
02:39:09,468 --> 02:39:14,882
LAURA: Oh yes. I think if we give her access to
Thordak's body afterwards, we're asking for a lot

1896
02:39:14,882 --> 02:39:15,803
of trouble.

1897
02:39:15,803 --> 02:39:19,964
TALIESIN: Which is why if Keyleth can figure out a
way to cure her of this disease, it takes a big

1898
02:39:19,964 --> 02:39:21,432
card off the table.

1899
02:39:21,432 --> 02:39:22,805
LIAM: We've got 24 hours.

1900
02:39:22,805 --> 02:39:24,048
MARISHA: I have ideas.

1901
02:39:24,048 --> 02:39:27,085
TALIESIN: We have more than that, because it's
going to take quite a while. That's how long we

1902
02:39:27,085 --> 02:39:28,274
have to make a plan.

1903
02:39:28,274 --> 02:39:32,527
LAURA: Question. What if we do actually just kill
her?

1904
02:39:32,527 --> 02:39:34,211
SAM: Raishan?

1905
02:39:34,211 --> 02:39:38,572
LAURA: When we fake that we're killing her, what
if we kill her?

1906
02:39:38,572 --> 02:39:39,850
MARISHA: Just actually kill her?

1907
02:39:39,850 --> 02:39:42,865
TALIESIN: She's going to be expecting that, and it
will not work.

1908
02:39:42,865 --> 02:39:47,954
TRAVIS: And she's super slippery. She just totally
like evaded Percy's sneak stabby-stab.

1909
02:39:47,954 --> 02:39:50,092
LIAM: Is there anyone around right now?

1910
02:39:50,092 --> 02:39:54,369
MATT: Oh yeah, no. Allura, Drake--

1911
02:39:54,369 --> 02:39:56,575
LIAM: 20, natural 20! For perception.

1912
02:39:56,575 --> 02:39:58,199
MATT: For perception?

1913
02:39:58,199 --> 02:40:00,402
LIAM: Yeah. I said, "Is anyone around?" and I
rolled a 20.

1914
02:40:00,402 --> 02:40:02,000
MATT: You guys are still in the war room.

1915
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:05,445
LIAM: I know, but you know what I'm talking about.
You know what I'm talking about.

1916
02:40:05,445 --> 02:40:06,561
MATT: Oh!

1917
02:40:06,561 --> 02:40:10,290
LIAM: There it is, it's right there. Invisible
fucking Larkin dwarf dragon.

1918
02:40:10,290 --> 02:40:11,899
MATT: You don't see anybody else around.

1919
02:40:11,899 --> 02:40:13,081
LIAM: All right. That's a 20.

1920
02:40:13,081 --> 02:40:16,485
LAURA: Should we continue this conversation
downstairs?

1921
02:40:16,485 --> 02:40:19,883
TALIESIN: First, is everybody who they say they
are? Please, if you would be so kind.

1922
02:40:19,883 --> 02:40:23,944
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, Allura. Can we light your sage real
quick, make sure everybody's on the up and up?

1923
02:40:23,944 --> 02:40:31,765
MATT: Allura sits up and says, "Well, I mean, it
makes sense. Asum is the one that requested we not

1924
02:40:31,765 --> 02:40:33,803
"move the war room down to the--"

1925
02:40:33,803 --> 02:40:36,373
TALIESIN: So why don't we move the war room now?

1926
02:40:36,373 --> 02:40:43,419
MATT: "I think that would be the best, yes. Let us
all adjourn to the new space at the ziggurat. That

1927
02:40:43,419 --> 02:40:45,196
"should at least keep things honest."

1928
02:40:45,196 --> 02:40:46,376
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1929
02:40:46,376 --> 02:40:49,392
MATT: Allura picks her robes up and--

1930
02:40:49,392 --> 02:40:51,547
SAM: Grog, your beard might go away.

1931
02:40:51,547 --> 02:40:53,648
LAURA: (gasps) No!

1932
02:40:53,648 --> 02:40:55,281
TRAVIS: No, it's in there.

1933
02:40:55,281 --> 02:40:57,574
TALIESIN: It just won't grow while he's down
there.

1934
02:40:57,574 --> 02:41:03,789
LIAM: I mean for science, right? Let's go. You
look really good without a beard, Grog. I've

1935
02:41:03,789 --> 02:41:05,119
always thought so.

1936
02:41:05,119 --> 02:41:06,425
TRAVIS: You shut up, you.

1937
02:41:06,425 --> 02:41:08,379
(laughter)

1938
02:41:08,379 --> 02:41:12,249
TRAVIS: We can go down there, I don't care.

1939
02:41:12,249 --> 02:41:14,314
TALIESIN: All right.

1940
02:41:14,314 --> 02:41:18,740
MATT: Okay. You guys make your way down to the
ziggurat. The guards come and start carrying

1941
02:41:18,740 --> 02:41:23,509
chairs and other elements of the war room.
Eventually, you're all led down through the

1942
02:41:23,509 --> 02:41:28,376
tunnels, which have been a little more refined and
given an actual more comfortable path past the

1943
02:41:28,376 --> 02:41:34,103
now-defunct whitestone refinery that the
Briarwoods had originally established. You enter

1944
02:41:34,103 --> 02:41:41,276
the ziggurat room. It has more lighting to it than
it previously did. A number of torches now line

1945
02:41:41,276 --> 02:41:48,306
the walls, the sconces that are lit as the guards
progress upward. You can see the reflection to the

1946
02:41:48,306 --> 02:41:56,331
green glass-like Whitestone material that
permeates the outside of the ziggurat. And not

1947
02:41:56,331 --> 02:42:02,775
right by it, but partially upward there's a small
wooden platform that's been where the main base of

1948
02:42:02,775 --> 02:42:06,427
operations for research and study is here. You see
a number of desks set out. It's been built

1949
02:42:06,427 --> 02:42:14,793
alongside of the large pyramid-type structure. And
eventually, you all adjourn up into that space. As

1950
02:42:14,793 --> 02:42:25,101
you go up there, you all feel a significant drop
in enchantment. All of your magical items, all of

1951
02:42:25,101 --> 02:42:33,129
everything, gradually fades in this space. So,
Grog, you actually feel your musculature-- the

1952
02:42:33,129 --> 02:42:38,781
Titanstone Gauntlets themselves, the effect begins
to completely fade back to your classic,

1953
02:42:38,781 --> 02:42:40,441
Grog-like strength.

1954
02:42:40,441 --> 02:42:42,401
TRAVIS: I feel totally fine.

1955
02:42:42,401 --> 02:42:45,914
LAURA: Are the walls still like people?

1956
02:42:45,914 --> 02:42:48,627
MATT: Oh, do you want to go to the top of the
ziggurat and check?

1957
02:42:48,627 --> 02:42:51,126
MARISHA: Oh.

1958
02:42:51,126 --> 02:42:53,426
TALIESIN: Not yet. After the meeting.

1959
02:42:53,426 --> 02:42:56,734
MARISHA: Did they have like a clean-up crew down
there?

1960
02:42:56,734 --> 02:43:02,608
TALIESIN: It's a guy on a scaffold with a scrub
brush going, "Ew. Ew."

1961
02:43:02,608 --> 02:43:04,965
LAURA: They're really clean naked bodies now.

1962
02:43:04,965 --> 02:43:06,563
LIAM: Brush cleaning out the fingernails.

1963
02:43:06,563 --> 02:43:11,187
MATT: At this point, they're looking around.
Everyone who's journeyed with you towards this new

1964
02:43:11,187 --> 02:43:17,398
meeting place, the ziggurat, is of the same
physicality they were at the meeting room. Any

1965
02:43:17,398 --> 02:43:22,402
illusions that would have been cast aside or dispelled
at this point seem to not be present. So everyone

1966
02:43:22,402 --> 02:43:26,521
is, by all intents and purposes, who they say they
are.

1967
02:43:26,521 --> 02:43:28,045
SAM: Okay.

1968
02:43:28,045 --> 02:43:32,491
TALIESIN: And this also means it would
probably be impossible to scry in this room.

1969
02:43:32,525 --> 02:43:34,108
MARISHA: Yes.

1970
02:43:34,108 --> 02:43:37,156
MATT: Allura nods. "Yes, actually. Yes."

1971
02:43:37,156 --> 02:43:43,360
TALIESIN: Excellent. This is where all talk must
happen now.

1972
02:43:43,360 --> 02:43:45,737
LAURA: Where it should have been happening.

1973
02:43:45,737 --> 02:43:54,523
TALIESIN: So now you know what we've been dealing
with for the past 72 hours. She did help with the

1974
02:43:54,523 --> 02:43:58,449
death of that dragon. In fact, I doubt we would
have survived without her aid. She could have very

1975
02:43:58,449 --> 02:44:00,457
easily left us there to die.

1976
02:44:00,457 --> 02:44:10,288
LAURA: It's true. She actually revealed her entire
form during the battle. Which is quite diseased.

1977
02:44:10,288 --> 02:44:13,561
TALIESIN: At least it appeared diseased.

1978
02:44:13,561 --> 02:44:17,977
MARISHA: She's definitely not as strong as the
others, but far more clever.

1979
02:44:17,977 --> 02:44:28,388
TALIESIN: And she knows where we are. And what our
plans are. And every inch of this place. Including

1980
02:44:28,388 --> 02:44:29,767
this thing.

1981
02:44:29,767 --> 02:44:37,210
MATT: "Well then, what do you presume we do?"

1982
02:44:37,210 --> 02:44:43,554
SAM: We don't really have a choice, we have to
work with her to some extent. We can make it hard

1983
02:44:43,554 --> 02:44:49,737
for her, and we can be assholes to her, and go
tell her to get Asum for us. But other than that,

1984
02:44:49,737 --> 02:44:51,323
we have to work with her.

1985
02:44:51,323 --> 02:44:54,147
LIAM: What's the benefit of working with her?

1986
02:44:54,147 --> 02:44:58,054
SAM: Because if we don't, she can destroy
Whitestone whenever she feels like it.

1987
02:44:58,054 --> 02:45:01,731
LIAM: What if we tell her we're going to fake her
death, and then we kill her for real?

1988
02:45:01,731 --> 02:45:05,037
SAM: That's fine, if she ever gets close enough
for us to kill her.

1989
02:45:05,037 --> 02:45:06,422
TALIESIN: She's not going to.

1990
02:45:06,422 --> 02:45:08,593
TRAVIS: She evaded it really easy.

1991
02:45:08,593 --> 02:45:13,708
SAM: Why would she need to come face to face with
us in that plan, ever? She could say, "I'm going

1992
02:45:13,708 --> 02:45:16,995
"to go meet them in Kymal. Oh, I died!"

1993
02:45:16,995 --> 02:45:23,511
TALIESIN: Our best bet is maybe-- hopefully enough
of us still have our strength. Maybe at the end if

1994
02:45:23,511 --> 02:45:25,778
she has been ravaged by the red dragon.

1995
02:45:25,778 --> 02:45:28,122
TRAVIS: I agree.

1996
02:45:28,122 --> 02:45:30,495
LAURA: And then we try to defeat her after that?

1997
02:45:30,495 --> 02:45:34,614
TRAVIS: I agree. Our play is the finish line.
That's it. Not a moment before.

1998
02:45:34,614 --> 02:45:37,428
LAURA: But we have to beat her to it. If she gets
a hold of that stone--

1999
02:45:37,428 --> 02:45:39,773
MARISHA: It's what she wants.

2000
02:45:39,773 --> 02:45:40,740
LAURA: Yes.

2001
02:45:40,740 --> 02:45:42,006
TALIESIN: Our hope is to break the stone.

2002
02:45:42,006 --> 02:45:43,447
MARISHA: We can't break the stone.

2003
02:45:43,447 --> 02:45:45,425
TALIESIN: Only because no one has.

2004
02:45:45,425 --> 02:45:50,639
SAM: If we draw Thordak to us, at least we control
the battlefield. She could still be lying in wait

2005
02:45:50,639 --> 02:45:52,747
to pounce on his body the second we kill him.

2006
02:45:52,747 --> 02:46:00,560
LIAM: If. We have to hope that she's actually
going to fight with us. She's done it once. We

2007
02:46:00,560 --> 02:46:03,927
don't know that she's going to do it again. We
don't know.

2008
02:46:03,927 --> 02:46:10,745
MARISHA: They mentioned moving the stone that
shouldn't have been able to have been moved.

2009
02:46:10,745 --> 02:46:18,296
Correct? They moved it inside of Thordak, and then
Thordak left with the stone in him, right?

2010
02:46:18,296 --> 02:46:21,067
TALIESIN: Yes, which I don't think should have
been possible.

2011
02:46:21,067 --> 02:46:28,935
MARISHA: Right. So how did they do it? Because I'm
also looking at another thing that is supposedly

2012
02:46:28,935 --> 02:46:30,857
immovable.

2013
02:46:30,857 --> 02:46:34,767
LAURA, MARISHA, and TALIESIN: Supposedly.

2014
02:46:34,767 --> 02:46:37,873
TALIESIN: Oh, it's possible. Nothing is
impossible.

2015
02:46:37,873 --> 02:46:41,089
LAURA: Are you suggesting we put the vortex of
doom inside one of us?

2016
02:46:41,089 --> 02:46:43,272
MARISHA: Kind of, yeah. That's what I was--

2017
02:46:43,272 --> 02:46:49,322
MATT: Allura immediately puts her hands up and
goes, "No! No. No. No."

2018
02:46:49,322 --> 02:46:50,977
MARISHA: There's got to be a way to move it.

2019
02:46:50,977 --> 02:46:52,329
SAM: To do what, though?

2020
02:46:52,329 --> 02:46:57,433
MATT: "This is an absence of magic. It is a void
of magic. It is a maw that devours magic. The

2021
02:46:57,433 --> 02:46:59,612
"enchantment that we put within Thordak is pure
magic."

2022
02:46:59,612 --> 02:47:02,716
LIAM: And you've been working on it for months,
and you are smarter than us.

2023
02:47:02,716 --> 02:47:04,151
MATT: "Well."

2024
02:47:04,151 --> 02:47:07,483
LAURA: Right. No way to transport it? None at
all?

2025
02:47:07,483 --> 02:47:10,273
MARISHA: It could be the only thing that could
break the stone!

2026
02:47:10,273 --> 02:47:16,274
LAURA: Think about it. If we could get that stone
next to the vortex, he'd be fucked.

2027
02:47:16,274 --> 02:47:23,985
MATT: "Right! So what, we take a few wooden two by
fours and push it along? Look, everything I know,

2028
02:47:23,985 --> 02:47:35,270
"everything I've studied, everything I've spent my
entire life working for is useless near that."

2029
02:47:35,270 --> 02:47:38,828
LAURA: This is a temple to Ioun, right?

2030
02:47:38,828 --> 02:47:39,983
MATT: "It was."

2031
02:47:39,983 --> 02:47:41,503
LAURA: The goddess of knowledge?

2032
02:47:41,503 --> 02:47:44,134
SAM: Sure.

2033
02:47:44,134 --> 02:47:48,093
MATT: "The only person I know of who rightfully
worshipped Ioun was Brom."

2034
02:47:48,093 --> 02:47:49,490
LAURA: Brom?

2035
02:47:49,490 --> 02:47:51,112
SAM: Of the Clasp?

2036
02:47:51,112 --> 02:47:55,424
MATT: "Arbiter Brom. He was of the council with
us."

2037
02:47:55,424 --> 02:47:58,620
LAURA: And he's in Emon, potentially?

2038
02:47:58,620 --> 02:48:04,871
MATT: "According to Raishan. With Tofor and--"

2039
02:48:04,871 --> 02:48:06,582
LAURA: Brom's with Asum?

2040
02:48:06,582 --> 02:48:07,587
MATT: "Yes."

2041
02:48:07,587 --> 02:48:17,302
TALIESIN: What holds it there? It's a shame we
can't open a giant door and push it down here.

2042
02:48:17,302 --> 02:48:20,944
MARISHA: What did you just say?

2043
02:48:20,944 --> 02:48:22,481
TALIESIN: We can't do it.

2044
02:48:22,481 --> 02:48:23,802
MARISHA: What? Say it again, one more time?

2045
02:48:23,802 --> 02:48:26,268
TALIESIN: It's a shame we can't open a giant door
and push the dragon in here.

2046
02:48:26,268 --> 02:48:28,261
SAM: How on earth could we--?

2047
02:48:28,261 --> 02:48:32,461
TALIESIN: We couldn't do it. It won't work.
Because that side of the door won't open by its

2048
02:48:32,461 --> 02:48:38,736
very nature. No door can be opened to this room.
No one can get in or out without someone walking.

2049
02:48:38,736 --> 02:48:40,625
LAURA: You couldn't have used the gate scroll in
here.

2050
02:48:40,625 --> 02:48:44,069
TALIESIN: I'm trying to even conceive of a machine
that could move this. But I don't understand why

2051
02:48:44,069 --> 02:48:45,289
it's here in the first place.

2052
02:48:45,289 --> 02:48:51,619
SAM: I don't think the secret to defeating Thordak
is moving this thing.

2053
02:48:51,619 --> 02:49:02,961
TALIESIN: It's a shame we couldn't. We have a line
in the sand of how close we can get to this thing

2054
02:49:02,961 --> 02:49:04,654
with magic, correct?

2055
02:49:04,654 --> 02:49:17,646
MATT: "This way." And she leads you back down the
ziggurat, out to the entrance where you guys

2056
02:49:17,646 --> 02:49:29,172
entered this large chamber. And about 20 or so
meters back, you can see there is a specific

2057
02:49:29,172 --> 02:49:36,851
wooden support beam that is structured within this
tunnel. And on that beam, elements of it are

2058
02:49:36,851 --> 02:49:43,596
painted black. And she goes, "This is the
perimeter in which the siphon devours magic

2059
02:49:43,596 --> 02:49:45,087
"inward."

2060
02:49:45,087 --> 02:49:50,140
MARISHA: How big is it? How big is it, roughly?

2061
02:49:50,140 --> 02:49:51,391
MATT: What, the--?

2062
02:49:51,391 --> 02:49:52,582
MARISHA: Perimeter.

2063
02:49:52,582 --> 02:50:01,916
MATT: "I'd say it'd take a half-mile?"

2064
02:50:01,916 --> 02:50:11,728
MARISHA: Damn, this place is really big. And it's
encased in stone, yeah? Kind of, right? Were we

2065
02:50:11,728 --> 02:50:14,739
encased in whitestone? Right?

2066
02:50:14,739 --> 02:50:16,431
TALIESIN: In stone. I've got a terrible idea.

2067
02:50:16,431 --> 02:50:17,501
MARISHA: Tell me!

2068
02:50:17,501 --> 02:50:28,533
TALIESIN: What happens to magical creatures when
they enter the circle? Have we experimented at all

2069
02:50:28,533 --> 02:50:32,667
to find out what would happen to a magical
creature? A creature whose very essence is magic?

2070
02:50:32,667 --> 02:50:34,768
MATT: "I don't know."

2071
02:50:34,768 --> 02:50:38,965
TALIESIN: (sighs) There's no humane way to do
this.

2072
02:50:38,965 --> 02:50:41,903
SAM: Sure there is! Kiki, get a fey creature in
here.

2073
02:50:41,903 --> 02:50:43,691
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I was thinking, send him
in.

2074
02:50:43,691 --> 02:50:46,404
MARISHA: Oh yeah, they die and they go right back
to their plane.

2075
02:50:46,404 --> 02:50:48,313
SAM: No, I think they just die.

2076
02:50:48,313 --> 02:50:53,708
TALIESIN: And even if they do go back to their
plane, they may not be able to in there, they may

2077
02:50:53,708 --> 02:50:56,959
wither and actually die. I just wanted to put that
on the table.

2078
02:50:56,959 --> 02:50:58,756
MARISHA: Are you trying to make me feel better
about any of this?

2079
02:50:58,756 --> 02:51:05,110
TALIESIN: I don't want to lie to you about this.
I've been practicing intense levels of honesty, if

2080
02:51:05,110 --> 02:51:07,596
not telling the whole truth.

2081
02:51:07,596 --> 02:51:11,065
TRAVIS: Sidebar. Do we have all the Vestiges that
the sphinx told us about?

2082
02:51:11,065 --> 02:51:12,008
SAM: No.

2083
02:51:12,008 --> 02:51:13,149
TRAVIS: What else is there?

2084
02:51:13,149 --> 02:51:14,667
SAM: There's one in the Fire Plane.

2085
02:51:14,667 --> 02:51:16,983
LIAM: Something for Pickle.

2086
02:51:16,983 --> 02:51:19,288
MARISHA: The Dawn Martyr. Dawn Martyr?

2087
02:51:19,288 --> 02:51:24,982
TRAVIS: I know I'm not the smartest one in the
group, but we don't know what the fuck we're

2088
02:51:24,982 --> 02:51:29,056
talking about with this little sphere. Why don't
we go find that last Vestige and see what it turns up?

2089
02:51:29,056 --> 02:51:31,166
LAURA: I don't know if we have a lot of time--

2090
02:51:31,166 --> 02:51:33,615
TALIESIN: We have time. In a day.

2091
02:51:33,615 --> 02:51:35,554
MARISHA: I mean, only if we--

2092
02:51:35,554 --> 02:51:42,109
TALIESIN: In a day she returns. We chose a place,
we move our forces in there. We have days where

2093
02:51:42,109 --> 02:51:45,826
she could be looking for us, and then when she
disappears it's going to take a day or two for him

2094
02:51:45,826 --> 02:51:50,103
to really find out. It will be about three to four
days before anything actually happens.

2095
02:51:50,103 --> 02:51:55,087
SAM: What are we doing, going after this Vestige
when-- can any of us even use it?

2096
02:51:55,129 --> 02:51:56,329
MARISHA and LAURA: Pike.

2097
02:51:56,329 --> 02:52:02,242
TRAVIS: Well, I can. Kima might. I'm not much for
poetry, but it seems sort of poetic that Thordak

2098
02:52:02,242 --> 02:52:06,520
came from the Fire Plane, and the last Vestige
we're looking for is in the Fire Plane.

2099
02:52:06,520 --> 02:52:10,397
MARISHA: Also, we might be able to find some
information on the stone.

2100
02:52:10,397 --> 02:52:11,596
LAURA: This is true.

2101
02:52:11,596 --> 02:52:14,204
SAM: The Fire Plane isn't just like Dallas.

2102
02:52:14,204 --> 02:52:21,128
TALIESIN: It actually is quite like Dallas. I
think that's a very reasonable comparison.

2103
02:52:21,128 --> 02:52:23,191
SAM: It's a horrible place where we could
all die.

2104
02:52:23,191 --> 02:52:26,443
TRAVIS: Well, so was the Feywild, and we didn't--

2105
02:52:26,443 --> 02:52:31,322
SAM: We're risking our hides for something that
might benefit one of us, maybe.

2106
02:52:31,322 --> 02:52:34,522
LAURA: Well, that's what we've been doing this
entire time.

2107
02:52:34,522 --> 02:52:36,699
TRAVIS: That's basically all of our choices at
this point.

2108
02:52:36,699 --> 02:52:40,665
MARISHA: We could go in with the rest of the Fire
Ashari that are there. We can meet up with

2109
02:52:40,665 --> 02:52:47,738
Cerkonos. Is this whole ziggurat encased in 
whitestone?

2110
02:52:47,738 --> 02:52:57,884
MATT: The ziggurat itself is built from stone, and
then the upper exterior of it is covered in this

2111
02:52:57,884 --> 02:53:04,263
green glass-like substance that is distilled
whitestone residuum.

2112
02:53:04,263 --> 02:53:10,490
TALIESIN: I have a plan. It will take a little bit
of time, but it's vicious.

2113
02:53:10,490 --> 02:53:12,602
MARISHA: What?

2114
02:53:12,602 --> 02:53:17,178
TALIESIN: It probably wouldn't work. Well, let's
find out what happens to a creature inside here

2115
02:53:17,178 --> 02:53:18,050
before we--

2116
02:53:18,050 --> 02:53:19,523
TRAVIS: A regular creature or a Feywild creature?

2117
02:53:19,523 --> 02:53:21,530
MARISHA: Okay, I actually do have Conjure Woodland
Beings.

2118
02:53:21,530 --> 02:53:24,804
LAURA: That's not a magic creature though, it's a
woodland being.

2119
02:53:24,804 --> 02:53:27,664
MARISHA: No, woodland beings can be like fey
creatures.

2120
02:53:27,664 --> 02:53:28,507
LAURA: Really?

2121
02:53:28,507 --> 02:53:29,597
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

2122
02:53:29,597 --> 02:53:30,647
TALIESIN: Something small.

2123
02:53:30,647 --> 02:53:32,539
TRAVIS: Do it! Oh my god, do it!

2124
02:53:32,539 --> 02:53:35,302
LAURA: Just a fairy. Just a teeny little fairy.

2125
02:53:35,302 --> 02:53:36,876
MARISHA: Okay.

2126
02:53:36,876 --> 02:53:38,332
MATT: What level's that? That is--

2127
02:53:38,332 --> 02:53:39,876
MARISHA: Third level.

2128
02:53:39,876 --> 02:53:45,582
TRAVIS: Wait, if you like conjure it outside and
walk in, is it going to go poof and disappear?

2129
02:53:45,582 --> 02:53:46,750
LAURA: Potentially. We'll find out.

2130
02:53:46,750 --> 02:53:47,852
MATT: A fourth level, you mean.

2131
02:53:47,852 --> 02:53:48,930
MARISHA: Sorry, fourth level.

2132
02:53:48,930 --> 02:53:50,999
MATT: Yeah, so you can create some fey creatures,
yeah. What are you summoning?

2133
02:53:50,999 --> 02:53:54,091
MARISHA: What makes sense?

2134
02:53:54,091 --> 02:53:57,388
TRAVIS: What's going to squeal?

2135
02:53:57,388 --> 02:53:59,932
TALIESIN: We're on one side of the line. Send it
to the other, see what happens.

2136
02:53:59,932 --> 02:54:01,929
MARISHA: I'll summon a--

2137
02:54:01,929 --> 02:54:03,212
SAM: Little pixie!

2138
02:54:03,212 --> 02:54:06,403
MARISHA: A little-- (stutters) A little pixie.

2139
02:54:06,403 --> 02:54:09,683
LAURA: (copying Marisha) Lalittle lilittle li-- A
little pixie.

2140
02:54:09,683 --> 02:54:11,529
MARISHA: A lillul lillul pixie.

2141
02:54:11,529 --> 02:54:15,601
SAM: Hi, little pixie! Go in that room!

2142
02:54:15,601 --> 02:54:20,050
TALIESIN: This may be, by the way, how we deal
with Raishan.

2143
02:54:20,050 --> 02:54:21,750
MARISHA: What?

2144
02:54:21,750 --> 02:54:23,430
MATT: Okay. So you conjure a pixie?

2145
02:54:23,430 --> 02:54:25,364
MARISHA: Sure. And I send her in.

2146
02:54:25,364 --> 02:54:33,019
MATT: Pixie flies in. Continues to fly in. Nothing
happens.

2147
02:54:33,019 --> 02:54:34,273
TALIESIN: Pixie's fine?

2148
02:54:34,273 --> 02:54:35,424
MATT: Pixie seems fine.

2149
02:54:35,424 --> 02:54:37,284
SAM: Pixie's not a magical creature, I guess.

2150
02:54:37,284 --> 02:54:38,569
LAURA: Isn't it, though?

2151
02:54:38,569 --> 02:54:43,621
SAM: Has magic, maybe. Isn't a magical being.

2152
02:54:43,621 --> 02:54:47,431
TALIESIN: Can you make the pixie do something? Try
and have the pixie do something magical.

2153
02:54:47,431 --> 02:54:54,192
MARISHA: Yeah. I have them. Can't they cast like
Confusion or something like that? Or can they cast--?

2154
02:54:54,192 --> 02:54:55,748
SAM: Polymorph.

2155
02:54:55,748 --> 02:54:59,700
MATT: They can cast Confusion, they can cast
Polymorph, they can cast things like that.

2156
02:54:59,700 --> 02:55:03,113
MARISHA: Hey! Try and Polymorph me!

2157
02:55:03,113 --> 02:55:08,139
MATT: Pixie turns around and nothing happens.

2158
02:55:08,139 --> 02:55:09,704
MARISHA: Nothing?

2159
02:55:09,704 --> 02:55:13,723
MATT: Pixie looks confused. "What? Sorry."

2160
02:55:13,723 --> 02:55:19,918
TALIESIN: It's all right, you did very well. How
do you feel? Do you feel all right?

2161
02:55:19,918 --> 02:55:26,983
MATT: Technically, this pixie--

2162
02:55:26,983 --> 02:55:31,325
TRAVIS: Touch it.

2163
02:55:31,325 --> 02:55:36,988
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of this, sure.
There is very basic communication. The pixie is--

2164
02:55:36,988 --> 02:55:38,319
TALIESIN: Tinkerbell.

2165
02:55:38,319 --> 02:55:46,706
MATT: Yeah, Sylvan is the language that it speaks,
so it is close enough to Elvish that those who

2166
02:55:46,706 --> 02:55:48,998
speak Elvish can like interpret elements of it.

2167
02:55:48,998 --> 02:55:52,391
MARISHA: Oh, I know Sylvan. I know Sylvan. Hey!
How do you feel?

2168
02:55:52,391 --> 02:55:55,517
MATT: "A little queasy, that's all."

2169
02:55:55,517 --> 02:55:56,904
MARISHA: Queasy? Yeah?

2170
02:55:56,904 --> 02:55:58,137
MATT: "It's weird."

2171
02:55:58,137 --> 02:56:06,470
MARISHA: Hmm. Hey, will you do me a favor and
don't hold it against me?

2172
02:56:06,470 --> 02:56:11,128
TALIESIN: Why don't you let it leave?

2173
02:56:11,128 --> 02:56:13,062
TRAVIS: Just go do it! Just do it!

2174
02:56:13,062 --> 02:56:14,494
MARISHA: Will you go touch that black orb?

2175
02:56:14,494 --> 02:56:16,101
TALIESIN: No no no, don't do that!

2176
02:56:16,101 --> 02:56:18,563
TRAVIS: Yeah yeah yeah, go touch it. She meant
what she said.

2177
02:56:18,563 --> 02:56:20,807
MATT: I mean, she's only listening to her, so--

2178
02:56:20,807 --> 02:56:22,827
LIAM: Yeah, it doesn't matter what Percy says.

2179
02:56:22,827 --> 02:56:25,408
TRAVIS: Do it. Fucking do it.

2180
02:56:25,408 --> 02:56:27,432
SAM: Let's see if it goes to the other world.

2181
02:56:27,432 --> 02:56:29,547
LAURA: You don't know where it goes.

2182
02:56:29,547 --> 02:56:30,937
TALIESIN: That's right, I don't know.

2183
02:56:30,937 --> 02:56:32,542
LIAM: No, you don't know what she's talking about.
It's Esperanto.

2184
02:56:32,542 --> 02:56:33,723
TRAVIS: You don't speak Sylvan.

2185
02:56:33,723 --> 02:56:35,367
TALIESIN: I've already done my dumb stuff for the
day.

2186
02:56:35,367 --> 02:56:37,800
LAURA: Stab stab stab.

2187
02:56:37,800 --> 02:56:41,085
TALIESIN: It would've been so badass!

2188
02:56:41,085 --> 02:56:46,772
MATT: All right, so yeah. You continue to walk as
the pixie floats up towards the top of the

2189
02:56:46,772 --> 02:56:50,285
ziggurat. You get to the top and you notice that
no, all the bodies have been removed. It's been

2190
02:56:50,285 --> 02:56:51,464
cleaned up.

2191
02:56:51,464 --> 02:56:53,178
LAURA: It's just an empty pyramid-y thing now.

2192
02:56:53,178 --> 02:56:58,899
MATT: Yeah, it's like this empty platform now with
the walls, encased within a small colosseum. And

2193
02:56:58,899 --> 02:57:06,137
there it is, the general spinning black marble.
The pixie approaches and like--

2194
02:57:06,137 --> 02:57:09,769
LAURA and TALIESIN: (whines worriedly)

2195
02:57:09,769 --> 02:57:13,364
MARISHA: Yeah! Yeah. You got this.

2196
02:57:13,364 --> 02:57:17,493
MATT: Touches it, and you watch the pixie go-- and
is gone.

2197
02:57:17,493 --> 02:57:20,930
MARISHA: Hmm. So as we expected, yeah.

2198
02:57:20,930 --> 02:57:22,485
TRAVIS: Well, hold on. Wait.

2199
02:57:22,485 --> 02:57:29,735
LAURA: Wait.

2200
02:57:29,735 --> 02:57:33,229
MARISHA: I don't think she's coming back, yeah.

2201
02:57:33,229 --> 02:57:37,737
LAURA: Hey Allura, how many things did you throw
in the orb?

2202
02:57:37,737 --> 02:57:44,403
MATT: You see her in the back leaning against the
wall like she's seen this a hundred times. "Oh,

2203
02:57:44,403 --> 02:57:53,700
"many things. Chairs, outfits, pieces of stone,
metals. We've put all kinds of things."

2204
02:57:53,700 --> 02:57:54,775
SAM: Any animals?

2205
02:57:54,775 --> 02:57:55,735
LIAM: Anything alive?

2206
02:57:55,735 --> 02:57:57,163
MATT: "No, nothing living!"

2207
02:57:57,163 --> 02:57:59,522
TRAVIS: What was the biggest thing you put in
there?

2208
02:57:59,522 --> 02:58:07,336
MATT: "Your desk chair. Cassandra said it would be
all right."

2209
02:58:07,336 --> 02:58:09,532
TALIESIN: (sighs) Yes.

2210
02:58:09,532 --> 02:58:14,161
LAURA: Have you put a box around it? Just
encapsulated it completely?

2211
02:58:14,161 --> 02:58:19,204
MATT: "We tried, and upon moving it, once it
contacted it did not move with the box. It just

2212
02:58:19,204 --> 02:58:21,739
"crushed and absorbed the box itself."

2213
02:58:21,739 --> 02:58:28,712
TALIESIN: So. I have an interesting request which
may end up being too complicated. I'm not sure.

2214
02:58:28,712 --> 02:58:30,765
TRAVIS: Probably.

2215
02:58:30,765 --> 02:58:36,388
TALIESIN: Can we build a teleportation sigil
directly above it? Outside of its range?

2216
02:58:36,388 --> 02:58:40,645
MATT: "Given the better part of a year, yes."

2217
02:58:40,645 --> 02:58:44,953
LIAM: So you're saying there's a chance?

2218
02:58:44,953 --> 02:58:50,515
TALIESIN: Can we build one in the hallway leading
to this room?

2219
02:58:50,515 --> 02:58:54,625
MATT: "A temporary one, as in like a--"

2220
02:58:54,625 --> 02:58:56,702
MARISHA: Like a spell.

2221
02:58:56,702 --> 02:59:03,219
MATT: "Like a brief spell, yes. I can do that now.
It's the permanent installation of one that takes

2222
02:59:03,219 --> 02:59:04,958
"an exorbitant period of time."

2223
02:59:04,958 --> 02:59:12,152
TALIESIN: As long as we have some way of knowing
what point at which we re-enter this room. Then we

2224
02:59:12,152 --> 02:59:17,334
at least have a way of having it chase us into its
range.

2225
02:59:17,334 --> 02:59:18,832
MARISHA: Oh man.

2226
02:59:18,832 --> 02:59:21,982
TALIESIN: Or better still, if we run one way and
it runs the other.

2227
02:59:21,982 --> 02:59:27,106
MARISHA: Have you been in contact? Have you
attempted to scry, or do a Locate Object spell on

2228
02:59:27,106 --> 02:59:30,747
anything that you've thrown in? Probably?

2229
02:59:30,747 --> 02:59:35,434
MATT: "Yes, but unfortunately there's been no way
of connecting anything that goes through. It just

2230
02:59:35,434 --> 02:59:36,554
"vanishes."

2231
02:59:36,554 --> 02:59:41,581
SAM: I think that's a fucking terrible idea.

2232
02:59:41,581 --> 02:59:46,561
TRAVIS: (chanting) Fire Plane.

2233
02:59:46,561 --> 02:59:50,920
SAM: What are you talking about? We can't lure a
dragon into a teleportation circle big enough to

2234
02:59:50,920 --> 02:59:55,642
get a dragon through, and then somehow assume that
the dragon's going to keep running into the room

2235
02:59:55,642 --> 02:59:59,898
with no magic? And then what are we also going to
assume? That it's going to jump into the crazy

2236
02:59:59,898 --> 03:00:04,653
Vecna circle and become a ninth level of hell
after that? We have no idea! That's a terrible

2237
03:00:04,653 --> 03:00:06,276
idea! I'm vetoing it.

2238
03:00:06,276 --> 03:00:08,992
TRAVIS: I third that.

2239
03:00:08,992 --> 03:00:11,746
TALIESIN: The cereal shiller has a point.

2240
03:00:11,746 --> 03:00:18,472
LIAM: That idea's not grrreat!

2241
03:00:18,472 --> 03:00:20,205
(laughter)

2242
03:00:20,205 --> 03:00:22,687
LAURA: You've been waiting! Waiting to find a time
to say it, haven't you?

2243
03:00:22,687 --> 03:00:26,421
LIAM: Nope! Just drunkenly popped in my head.

2244
03:00:26,421 --> 03:00:30,589
TALIESIN: Yes, Grog. You have a point?

2245
03:00:30,589 --> 03:00:32,185
TRAVIS: Fire Plane.

2246
03:00:32,185 --> 03:00:40,700
TALIESIN: If we are going to do the Fire Plane, if
that is going to happen, then we cannot go until

2247
03:00:40,700 --> 03:00:45,790
preparations start getting made for the place at
which we're going to have this confrontation. We

2248
03:00:45,790 --> 03:00:53,664
need to pick a point, preferably far from here. Is
there a ruined city?

2249
03:00:53,664 --> 03:00:58,304
SAM: What, for us to lure Raishan-slash-Thordak to?

2250
03:00:58,304 --> 03:01:00,029
LAURA: What about Fort Daxio?

2251
03:01:00,029 --> 03:01:06,069
SAM: Fort Daxio's near Emon. And so is Kymal.

2252
03:01:06,069 --> 03:01:12,854
MATT: "Well, it's north of Emon. Kymal's east of
it. And the Ironsea Ridge. But Kymal's filled

2253
03:01:12,899 --> 03:01:14,287
"with civilians."

2254
03:01:14,287 --> 03:01:17,772
LAURA: Fort Daxio has an army gathering there
already, right?

2255
03:01:17,772 --> 03:01:22,433
MATT: "Well, Fort Daxio has a piece of an army.
Most of it went to Syngorn and we haven't heard since."

2256
03:01:22,433 --> 03:01:25,384
TALIESIN: Fort Daxio at least does have soldiers
already.

2257
03:01:25,384 --> 03:01:27,715
LAURA: Well, Syngorn is gathering their forces as
well.

2258
03:01:27,715 --> 03:01:31,492
MATT: "Have you reached out to Syngorn, let them
know this was going to happen? You mentioned that

2259
03:01:31,492 --> 03:01:32,489
"they were coming to power?"

2260
03:01:32,489 --> 03:01:33,630
LAURA: We have.

2261
03:01:33,630 --> 03:01:37,774
MATT: "Well, we need to reach out to the resources
we have and call them in."

2262
03:01:37,774 --> 03:01:38,940
LAURA and LIAM: Yes.

2263
03:01:38,940 --> 03:01:42,944
TALIESIN: Everyone, is Fort Daxio where this
confrontation is going to happen?

2264
03:01:42,944 --> 03:01:45,610
LAURA: We haven't been to Fort Daxio.

2265
03:01:45,610 --> 03:01:49,999
SAM: We should probably go check it out. But
everyone wants to go to the Fire Plane, get some

2266
03:01:49,999 --> 03:01:50,998
armor.

2267
03:01:50,998 --> 03:01:58,055
TALIESIN: We go to Fort Daxio to start everything
up. While they prepare, we can maybe make a trip

2268
03:01:58,055 --> 03:02:02,296
to the Fire Plane once things are prepared. They
will not need us to organize the armies and gather

2269
03:02:02,296 --> 03:02:03,448
forces.

2270
03:02:03,448 --> 03:02:08,447
MARISHA: It's really frustrating. I feel like we
have all the pieces here. I just can't figure it out.

2271
03:02:08,447 --> 03:02:12,517
TALIESIN: We have all the pieces buried underneath
every civilian.

2272
03:02:12,517 --> 03:02:17,824
MARISHA: I'm really obsessed on this ziggurat
thing. Have you thrown any whitestone into the

2273
03:02:17,824 --> 03:02:18,667
ziggurat?

2274
03:02:18,667 --> 03:02:19,715
TALIESIN: No, don't do that.

2275
03:02:19,715 --> 03:02:21,302
LAURA: I'm sure they already have.

2276
03:02:21,302 --> 03:02:22,443
MATT: "We have."

2277
03:02:22,443 --> 03:02:27,990
SAM: It's going to be fine, Keyleth. After we kill
Thordak and Raishan becomes super-powerful,

2278
03:02:27,990 --> 03:02:35,294
Raishan will come here and get the Vecna orb and
unleash all sorts of hells on the world, and then

2279
03:02:35,294 --> 03:02:36,668
we'll know what it was!

2280
03:02:36,668 --> 03:02:38,641
LIAM: I mean, that's basically what's going to
happen.

2281
03:02:38,641 --> 03:02:40,783
TALIESIN: That's a very good plan.

2282
03:02:40,783 --> 03:02:43,918
SAM: Yeah, I mean, we can't really do anything
about it.

2283
03:02:43,918 --> 03:02:47,012
MARISHA: Which is why it's frustrating, because I
feel like we can beat her to the fucking punch.

2284
03:02:47,012 --> 03:02:53,062
LIAM: Yeah, I think Thordak's a fucking meathead
and we should take care of Raishan ahead of time.

2285
03:02:53,062 --> 03:02:55,927
MARISHA: You already know how I feel.

2286
03:02:55,927 --> 03:03:00,144
TALIESIN: I think you're mad to think we can do
that. I think that you're mad to think we're

2287
03:03:00,144 --> 03:03:03,007
actually going to see her again before the final
confrontation.

2288
03:03:03,007 --> 03:03:04,659
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're not going to see her.

2289
03:03:04,659 --> 03:03:06,104
TALIESIN: I think she's going to stay far, far
away.

2290
03:03:06,104 --> 03:03:07,239
LAURA: No. She knows.

2291
03:03:07,239 --> 03:03:13,355
TALIESIN: I took that shot specifically to see
where she was sitting and see where we were

2292
03:03:13,355 --> 03:03:14,352
sitting with her.

2293
03:03:14,352 --> 03:03:18,550
LAURA: You took that shot specifically to stab her
three times in the back, Percy.

2294
03:03:18,550 --> 03:03:21,216
TALIESIN: It also worked that we found out she
wasn't there.

2295
03:03:21,216 --> 03:03:23,494
LIAM: Yes, revisionist history.

2296
03:03:23,494 --> 03:03:25,956
LAURA: I thought you were practicing honesty.

2297
03:03:25,956 --> 03:03:29,644
TRAVIS: That's like saying I farted because my
stomach hurt, and then I found out it stunk as well.

2298
03:03:29,644 --> 03:03:34,793
TALIESIN: I was aware it could go horribly wrong,
which is why I was prepared to say something.

2299
03:03:34,793 --> 03:03:37,026
LIAM: Likely, there's a master plan; we
understand.

2300
03:03:37,026 --> 03:03:41,360
TALIESIN: I'm not saying it was the best plan.

2301
03:03:41,360 --> 03:03:46,236
TRAVIS: Cool. Fort Daxio then? Check it out?

2302
03:03:46,236 --> 03:03:50,621
TALIESIN: Does anybody else have anything to say
to this?

2303
03:03:50,621 --> 03:03:54,622
MARISHA: We basically don't have a plan. We're
going somewhere until we come up with a plan in

2304
03:03:54,622 --> 03:03:55,586
the meantime.

2305
03:03:55,586 --> 03:03:59,688
TALIESIN: No, we're preparing all of our forces at
Fort Daxio.

2306
03:03:59,688 --> 03:04:05,744
MATT: Cassandra says, "If Fort Daxio is to be the
place where this is to go down, then that will be

2307
03:04:05,744 --> 03:04:07,417
"the place we'll send our allies."

2308
03:04:07,417 --> 03:04:10,881
MARISHA: Jesus. Let's put all of our eggs in one
basket.

2309
03:04:10,881 --> 03:04:13,757
SAM: Yeah. But what else are we saving
them for? This is it.

2310
03:04:13,757 --> 03:04:19,497
TALIESIN: This is the omelette. Where do we want
our allies? Far away from the red dragon?

2311
03:04:19,497 --> 03:04:22,838
MARISHA: You don't feel like we are stepping into
every trap that Raishan has laid?

2312
03:04:22,838 --> 03:04:24,614
SAM: What else can we do?

2313
03:04:24,614 --> 03:04:26,060
MARISHA: Kill Raishan first!

2314
03:04:26,060 --> 03:04:31,078
SAM: You can't heal the disease. We can't control
this orb. There's nothing else we can do.

2315
03:04:31,078 --> 03:04:33,847
MARISHA: It doesn't matter! We just need her to believe
that I can cure her disease.

2316
03:04:33,847 --> 03:04:37,625
LAURA: Let's be honest. Raishan wants Thordak
dead. That's her endgame as well.

2317
03:04:37,625 --> 03:04:39,472
LIAM: That's the only thing we can count on.

2318
03:04:39,472 --> 03:04:42,613
TALIESIN: Because right now Raishan could have us
all dead.

2319
03:04:42,613 --> 03:04:48,183
TRAVIS: Are you saying you want Raishan to go with
you one-on-one so you can do the Melora thing, and

2320
03:04:48,183 --> 03:04:52,946
then maybe you take her out? And you want a shot
at it before we try anything else? Because I'll

2321
03:04:52,946 --> 03:04:54,117
grant you that.

2322
03:04:54,117 --> 03:04:55,954
MARISHA: I could try. That's what I was trying to
bait her into.

2323
03:04:55,954 --> 03:04:58,075
LAURA: She's not going to show up.

2324
03:04:58,075 --> 03:05:06,203
MATT: Allura brings her hand up, "I've done plenty
of research on these. I mean no offense to you,

2325
03:05:06,203 --> 03:05:12,415
"Keyleth, but you convincing an entity that exists
on deception through deception to believe you in

2326
03:05:12,415 --> 03:05:17,814
"that regard? And based on that conversation, she
already seems to see through that ruse. I would

2327
03:05:17,814 --> 03:05:18,905
"not recommend it."

2328
03:05:18,905 --> 03:05:20,926
LIAM: Allura, any chance you know the Gate spell?

2329
03:05:20,926 --> 03:05:22,670
MATT: "No, that is far beyond my capabilities."

2330
03:05:22,670 --> 03:05:25,097
TRAVIS: Yeah. Rare spell, that.

2331
03:05:25,097 --> 03:05:31,250
TALIESIN: I'm not mad in thinking that trusting
this creature is the only option available at this

2332
03:05:31,250 --> 03:05:38,388
point. I say "trust". Walking in this direction is
the only direction available at the moment. Any

2333
03:05:38,388 --> 03:05:46,128
attempt to counter her at this point leads to our
destruction. She has us.

2334
03:05:46,128 --> 03:05:52,002
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, we got that. So does anybody want
to do anything else before we go to Daxio?

2335
03:05:52,002 --> 03:05:59,274
SAM: The only thing else that we can do before we
go to Daxio is to send word to our allies. I think

2336
03:05:59,274 --> 03:06:14,854
we should grab Kash, send him out a quick list of
who we need to contact. Ravenites. Feywild wolves.

2337
03:06:14,854 --> 03:06:16,243
LAURA and LIAM: Syngorn.

2338
03:06:16,243 --> 03:06:17,972
LIAM: Zahra, Kash.

2339
03:06:17,972 --> 03:06:19,468
LAURA: Your people, Keyleth.

2340
03:06:19,468 --> 03:06:21,086
LIAM: Kima. Allura.

2341
03:06:21,086 --> 03:06:23,415
TRAVIS: Wolves are on another plane. Herd is
wandering.

2342
03:06:23,415 --> 03:06:24,893
LAURA: J'mon.

2343
03:06:24,893 --> 03:06:36,554
SAM: That's by flute. Wait. What about our
brotherhood of-- what do we belong to? Not the Clasp--

2344
03:06:36,554 --> 03:06:38,088
LIAM: Slayer's Take.

2345
03:06:38,088 --> 03:06:42,529
SAM: The Slayer's Take! We can get them too,
right? We have money, we can hire them! We have a

2346
03:06:42,529 --> 03:06:43,926
hundred thousand gold!

2347
03:06:43,926 --> 03:06:45,961
TALIESIN: You want to hire them... Oh.

2348
03:06:45,961 --> 03:06:48,815
LAURA: We could take out a contract against
the red dragon.

2349
03:06:48,815 --> 03:06:50,730
SAM: Sure.

2350
03:06:50,730 --> 03:06:54,870
LAURA: We can hire them to kill a red dragon.

2351
03:06:54,870 --> 03:06:58,241
LIAM: Yeah. What are we going to do with that
money when we're dead? Nothing.

2352
03:06:58,241 --> 03:07:04,988
MARISHA: We are sending everyone we know into one
centralized location. Do we really feel like

2353
03:07:04,988 --> 03:07:06,376
that's a good idea?

2354
03:07:06,376 --> 03:07:09,520
SAM: Yes, this is what we've built towards.

2355
03:07:09,520 --> 03:07:10,821
MARISHA: Is it?

2356
03:07:10,821 --> 03:07:12,837
TALIESIN: We're building a trap. Where would you
put them?

2357
03:07:12,837 --> 03:07:17,162
MARISHA: We didn't talk about throwing everyone we
loved into the frying pan. That was not the trap.

2358
03:07:17,162 --> 03:07:20,770
SAM: What did you think we were making allegiances
for? Just to hang out with them? We need them to

2359
03:07:20,770 --> 03:07:22,215
fight and die for us!

2360
03:07:22,215 --> 03:07:26,511
MARISHA: I'm down for the cause of the war. Just
not when it's a stupid fucking plan!

2361
03:07:26,511 --> 03:07:28,234
SAM: We're going to be there too!

2362
03:07:28,234 --> 03:07:30,690
MARISHA: We don't have a plan! We're just asking
everyone to meet in one location.

2363
03:07:30,690 --> 03:07:33,622
LIAM: Well, we're talking about building an army.

2364
03:07:33,622 --> 03:07:35,872
MARISHA: And then doing what with them?

2365
03:07:35,872 --> 03:07:37,127
LIAM: To kill the general.

2366
03:07:37,127 --> 03:07:40,283
MARISHA: And then doing what? They're just going
to be sitting there! They're going to be sitting ducks!

2367
03:07:40,283 --> 03:07:44,205
TALIESIN: They're not going to be sitting there.
We're going to make tactical decisions about where

2368
03:07:44,205 --> 03:07:46,148
to place everyone in and around the fort.

2369
03:07:46,148 --> 03:07:53,824
MARISHA: I've accepted that people are going to
die. I've accepted that. I do not condone sending

2370
03:07:53,824 --> 03:07:56,654
people to their slaughter when we don't have a
goddamn plan.

2371
03:07:56,654 --> 03:08:00,154
TALIESIN: Well, what's your counter proposal?
Because I feel like we're making a plan here.

2372
03:08:00,154 --> 03:08:07,067
MARISHA: I don't think that it's smart to put
every potential ally we know in one spot. Can we

2373
03:08:07,067 --> 03:08:10,704
not divide it up? Can we not find places nearby?

2374
03:08:10,704 --> 03:08:18,501
TALIESIN: They won't all just be in the fort.
Everyone is going to be placed.

2375
03:08:18,501 --> 03:08:22,048
SAM: Once we get there and survey the area, we can
come up with a comfortable plan. You can make some

2376
03:08:22,048 --> 03:08:23,826
caverns for them to hide in.

2377
03:08:23,826 --> 03:08:28,516
TALIESIN: We're going to also create ways of
making sure the dragon can't take flight. We're

2378
03:08:28,516 --> 03:08:33,331
going to make sure that everyone has a purpose and
a place. It will not be just a giant swath of

2379
03:08:33,331 --> 03:08:34,753
people ready to die.

2380
03:08:34,753 --> 03:08:36,618
SAM: We're just getting them in the right county.

2381
03:08:36,618 --> 03:08:38,249
TALIESIN: We just need everybody in the city.

2382
03:08:38,249 --> 03:08:41,554
MARISHA: But we also know that Raishan knows
everything that we're going to do.

2383
03:08:41,554 --> 03:08:44,964
LAURA: She doesn't know Fort Daxio. She
doesn't know any of that.

2384
03:08:44,964 --> 03:08:49,654
TALIESIN: She doesn't know Fort Daxio.
Honestly, she's going to have to know. She's going

2385
03:08:49,654 --> 03:08:52,355
to have to send them. There's nothing we can do
about it.

2386
03:08:52,355 --> 03:08:53,928
LAURA: She doesn't know about J'mon Sa Ord.

2387
03:08:53,928 --> 03:08:55,583
MARISHA: I don't trust that she doesn't know
anything. I'm going to assume that she knows

2388
03:08:55,583 --> 03:08:56,484
everything.

2389
03:08:56,484 --> 03:08:57,516
TALIESIN: That's a good assumption.

2390
03:08:57,516 --> 03:08:58,538
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's fair.

2391
03:08:58,538 --> 03:09:02,265
TALIESIN: Even so, there's nothing that she's not
going to know, because she is what is luring him

2392
03:09:02,265 --> 03:09:09,286
out. If we fought him here, she already knows
where we are. Right now she knows where we are.

2393
03:09:09,286 --> 03:09:11,826
She knows everybody that's here.

2394
03:09:11,826 --> 03:09:14,014
SAM: I go behind Keyleth and stab three times.

2395
03:09:14,014 --> 03:09:17,179
(laughter)

2396
03:09:17,179 --> 03:09:19,597
TALIESIN: Is this happening? Are we doing this?
I'm so excited. Yeah!

2397
03:09:19,597 --> 03:09:21,357
SAM: No! I would so lose.

2398
03:09:21,357 --> 03:09:24,802
MARISHA: Bring it! She's on edge, all right?

2399
03:09:24,802 --> 03:09:31,397
TALIESIN: We have to play this the way we have to
play it. It's dangerous, but we have to assume

2400
03:09:31,397 --> 03:09:37,015
that she will most likely not betray us until the
end.

2401
03:09:37,015 --> 03:09:43,853
SAM: Right now, somewhere, there's a man on an
airship going, "Do you see it yet?"

2402
03:09:43,853 --> 03:09:47,490
LAURA: They're keeping an eye out at this point,
all right?

2403
03:09:47,490 --> 03:09:55,741
TALIESIN: They're being good. We have to assume
that she has not betrayed where we are yet, which

2404
03:09:55,741 --> 03:10:02,638
would have been so simple. It would have been so
simple just to raze this city to the ground.

2405
03:10:02,638 --> 03:10:09,439
MARISHA: Look at what we did with Ripley. We
walked into every trap she set for us blindly. We

2406
03:10:09,439 --> 03:10:13,279
got cocky. We got bold. We fell for all of that.

2407
03:10:13,279 --> 03:10:19,531
LAURA: Keyleth, we have to fight eventually. We're
not trying to be cocky about it; we're trying to

2408
03:10:19,531 --> 03:10:21,145
set up an army!

2409
03:10:21,145 --> 03:10:27,472
SAM: Might I point out, Keyleth, that Raishan
wanted us to go to Emon and face Thordak, and we

2410
03:10:27,472 --> 03:10:29,673
are already not following that plan.

2411
03:10:29,673 --> 03:10:31,015
LAURA: This is true.

2412
03:10:31,015 --> 03:10:35,208
TALIESIN: That is the other option. Go there.

2413
03:10:35,208 --> 03:10:44,207
LIAM: We can count on her to be duplicitous. We
gather forces; we take out Thordak. We'll figure out

2414
03:10:44,207 --> 03:10:49,434
how we're going to do it. We're not saying throw
every spaghetti at the wall. We figure that out.

2415
03:10:49,434 --> 03:10:52,058
Then we talk about the real enemy.

2416
03:10:52,058 --> 03:10:56,715
TALIESIN: It's a fort. We prepare the fort. It is
what a fort is for.

2417
03:10:56,715 --> 03:11:02,720
LAURA: If the opportunity arrives to take out
Raishan, then we do it. Beforehand. If not,

2418
03:11:02,720 --> 03:11:05,284
immediately after Thordak is dead.

2419
03:11:05,284 --> 03:11:09,335
MARISHA: We could all be dead.

2420
03:11:09,335 --> 03:11:16,109
TALIESIN: Why are we not dead right now? Explain
to me why we are not dead right now.

2421
03:11:16,109 --> 03:11:17,488
MARISHA: I honestly don't know.

2422
03:11:17,488 --> 03:11:22,676
TALIESIN: Because this fight is going to happen.
That is why we are not dead right now. It's

2423
03:11:22,676 --> 03:11:31,728
the only possible explanation that I can conceive
of. This fight is inevitable. Once this fight has

2424
03:11:31,728 --> 03:11:39,004
happened? Oh, we're dead. After this fight, I have
no doubt that we are in grave danger.

2425
03:11:39,004 --> 03:11:41,901
LAURA: After this fight, there won't be enough
people to bring us back anymore.

2426
03:11:41,901 --> 03:11:44,659
(laughter)

2427
03:11:44,659 --> 03:11:53,161
TALIESIN: But this fight, this first fight, is
going to happen. And we need our forces, and we

2428
03:11:53,161 --> 03:11:59,426
need them prepared, and we need them not marching
into a city. We need them in a city holding siege.

2429
03:11:59,426 --> 03:12:07,812
Preparing to tackle, to grapple, and to subdue as
best we can. To be difficult to find, to be

2430
03:12:07,812 --> 03:12:12,872
surrounding. We need all of these things, and we
cannot do any of these things unless we bring him

2431
03:12:12,872 --> 03:12:15,660
to a place where all of our power is.

2432
03:12:15,660 --> 03:12:17,666
MARISHA: Let's go check out Fort Daxio.

2433
03:12:17,666 --> 03:12:20,153
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Hey! (laughter)

2434
03:12:20,153 --> 03:12:25,486
TALIESIN: Isn't it interesting that we all feel
the need to convince her, no matter what? I'm just

2435
03:12:25,486 --> 03:12:26,740
pointing that out.

2436
03:12:26,740 --> 03:12:31,886
LIAM: Well, I don't know how we're going to get the
king out of the castle, but yeah.

2437
03:12:31,886 --> 03:12:35,844
LAURA: We need to figure out if Fort Daxio is the
place to send everyone, all right? We got to

2438
03:12:35,844 --> 03:12:37,130
fucking check it out.

2439
03:12:37,130 --> 03:12:39,781
TRAVIS: Let's put one foot in front of the
other first, shall we?

2440
03:12:39,781 --> 03:12:45,359
LIAM: Let's go buy some black powder. This is the
time.

2441
03:12:45,359 --> 03:12:47,501
SAM: How do we get there? We don't know of any
trees there.

2442
03:12:47,558 --> 03:12:48,654
MATT: (as Victor) "No!"

2443
03:12:48,654 --> 03:12:49,959
MARISHA: I can scry.

2444
03:12:49,959 --> 03:12:52,657
TALIESIN: Ironically, any town where you go to buy
black powder, it's always him. It's really

2445
03:12:52,657 --> 03:12:54,246
interesting. I don't know why.

2446
03:12:54,246 --> 03:12:56,200
LIAM: And he's in 16-bit every time!

2447
03:12:56,200 --> 03:12:57,998
(laughter)

2448
03:12:57,998 --> 03:13:02,032
SAM: Do we know anyone in Daxio? Can you scry
there to find a tree?

2449
03:13:02,032 --> 03:13:04,672
MARISHA: I can scry there regardless and find a
tree, yes.

2450
03:13:04,672 --> 03:13:07,603
TALIESIN: Does the rest of the council approve of
this ridiculous plan?

2451
03:13:07,603 --> 03:13:08,910
TRAVIS: Yes, I approve.

2452
03:13:08,910 --> 03:13:11,004
MARISHA: This non-plan.

2453
03:13:11,004 --> 03:13:18,916
MATT: Allura says, "Yes. I mean, I don't know
anyone in Daxio at the moment. Riskel was the only

2454
03:13:18,916 --> 03:13:23,958
"one. Or Riskel was the one I knew with a
connection there, and his father, Mikael, was in

2455
03:13:23,958 --> 03:13:25,507
"Syngorn."

2456
03:13:25,507 --> 03:13:30,968
TALIESIN: Do you think that they will be agreeable
to this plan?

2457
03:13:30,968 --> 03:13:37,057
MATT: "Who? Those who are there, most likely.
Here, I'll give you a written..." and she pulls

2458
03:13:37,057 --> 03:13:44,006
out a small little side scroll pouch. Scribbling a
note and says, "This is a decree from the council.

2459
03:13:44,006 --> 03:13:53,890
"They'll have to listen to you." She finishes
writing it, rolls it up, "So they'll be at your

2460
03:13:53,890 --> 03:13:57,392
"disposal. It's not the army; it's the reserves."

2461
03:13:57,392 --> 03:14:04,822
TALIESIN: Any powers that you can think of, let
them know where we are heading. Do not let them

2462
03:14:04,822 --> 03:14:12,058
know the plan. But let them know that if there are
forces to gather, they are gathering in that

2463
03:14:12,058 --> 03:14:13,315
direction.

2464
03:14:13,315 --> 03:14:21,177
SAM: And don't share our carefully crafted plan
with anyone. The details are so precise and exact!

2465
03:14:21,177 --> 03:14:23,111
You must keep them secret.

2466
03:14:23,111 --> 03:14:26,932
TALIESIN: The more precise details you have in a
war plan, the more things that will inevitably go

2467
03:14:26,932 --> 03:14:28,501
wrong in the first ten seconds.

2468
03:14:28,501 --> 03:14:34,910
SAM: Hey, how about we go to Daxio, and then you
guys can catch up? The airship arrives in a couple

2469
03:14:34,910 --> 03:14:36,280
of days.

2470
03:14:36,280 --> 03:14:38,278
MATT: "We'll do that. And then we're meeting you
at Daxio, correct?"

2471
03:14:38,278 --> 03:14:42,650
TRAVIS: Yeah. (chants) Dax-i-o. Dax-i-o.

2472
03:14:42,650 --> 03:14:46,381
TALIESIN: (chants) Dax-i-o. Daxio!

2473
03:14:46,381 --> 03:14:49,945
MATT: "Very well. Daxio it is. We'll see you
soon."

2474
03:14:49,945 --> 03:14:51,951
SAM: On the morrow.

2475
03:14:51,951 --> 03:14:54,045
TALIESIN: No, we plan.

2476
03:14:54,045 --> 03:14:55,187
SAM: Be pleased.

2477
03:14:55,187 --> 03:14:56,570
LIAM and LAURA: Beep beep.

2478
03:14:56,570 --> 03:14:58,919
MATT: Beep beep. Bidet.

2479
03:14:58,919 --> 03:15:00,573
MARISHA: Bidet. (laughter)

2480
03:15:00,573 --> 03:15:03,135
MATT: And with that, we'll finish the night's
session, picking up here for next week.

2481
03:15:03,135 --> 03:15:05,896
MARISHA: We're finishing it now?

2482
03:15:05,896 --> 03:15:07,515
MATT: Well, yeah. It's 10:30.

2483
03:15:07,515 --> 03:15:08,996
TRAVIS: What was under that blanket?

2484
03:15:08,996 --> 03:15:11,092
MATT: I don't know. You'll find out, I guess.

2485
03:15:11,092 --> 03:15:14,134
LIAM: Dumbfuck ending.

2486
03:15:14,181 --> 03:15:18,426
MARISHA: Sorry, guys.

2487
03:15:18,426 --> 03:15:21,203
TALIESIN: I tried to stab a dragon. I swear, I
tried.

2488
03:15:21,203 --> 03:15:22,880
TRAVIS: No, we know you did.

2489
03:15:22,880 --> 03:15:26,650
TALIESIN: I tried to end the game. I thought the
game could totally have been ended right there.

2490
03:15:26,650 --> 03:15:33,091
LIAM: You've got that gunslinger sneak attack
times ten damage against a green dragon.

2491
03:15:33,091 --> 03:15:35,520
TALIESIN: Man, I did the math on what that could
have done.

2492
03:15:35,520 --> 03:15:39,695
MATT: It could have been nasty, had it been a less
tricksy dragon, maybe.

2493
03:15:39,695 --> 03:15:41,831
TALIESIN: Had it been a less tricksy dragon, that
would have been...

2494
03:15:41,831 --> 03:15:45,564
LIAM: Matt, you've got a little something right--

2495
03:15:45,564 --> 03:15:48,592
MATT: (as Victor) There? Here?

2496
03:15:48,592 --> 03:15:51,606
LAURA: Right there.

2497
03:15:51,606 --> 03:15:53,107
LIAM and LAURA: You got it.

2498
03:15:53,107 --> 03:15:57,783
(laughter)

2499
03:15:57,783 --> 03:15:59,766
MATT: (as Victor) I get to enjoy this for a little
bit, at least.

2500
03:15:59,766 --> 03:16:02,405
TRAVIS: We should have him walk down the street
and take bets on how long it takes him to get

2501
03:16:02,405 --> 03:16:03,351
arrested.

2502
03:16:03,351 --> 03:16:05,561
(laughter)

2503
03:16:05,561 --> 03:16:08,384
LIAM: Just put him on Melrose.

2504
03:16:08,384 --> 03:16:14,756
MARISHA: Those YouTube videos of social
experiments? Just send out Matt.

2505
03:16:14,756 --> 03:16:18,880
MATT: (as Victor) Two cheeseburgers. Couple of
fry.

2506
03:16:18,880 --> 03:16:20,233
TALIESIN: Filet of fish!

2507
03:16:20,233 --> 03:16:28,956
MATT: (as Victor) Filet of fish! (normal voice)
Oh, man. All right. We'll be back next week. For

2508
03:16:28,956 --> 03:16:34,089
whatever the hell your final plan is going to be
for this.

2509
03:16:34,089 --> 03:16:38,144
TALIESIN: This is a great plan. I am behind this
plan 100%.

2510
03:16:38,144 --> 03:16:41,206
MATT: I am so excited.

2511
03:16:41,206 --> 03:16:44,987
TRAVIS and MATT: Thank you, Loot Crate.

2512
03:16:44,987 --> 03:16:47,510
SAM: Come on, Loot Crate.

2513
03:16:47,510 --> 03:16:54,810
MATT: I'm excited for the countdown to Thordak
that we're now embarking on.

2514
03:16:54,810 --> 03:16:58,980
TALIESIN: Maybe there will be time to run to the
Fire Plane really quick.

2515
03:16:58,980 --> 03:17:04,371
MARISHA: I was going to say, sorry for being a
pain in the ass. It takes a lot for me to

2516
03:17:04,371 --> 03:17:08,119
sacrifice all my people when a fourth of us have
already been sacrificed.

2517
03:17:08,119 --> 03:17:11,099
TALIESIN: We'll go to the Fire Plane and get them
and we'll pick up an object and we'll fight a

2518
03:17:11,099 --> 03:17:12,679
dragon. It will be great.

2519
03:17:12,679 --> 03:17:15,596
TRAVIS: It's cool. I have an internal timer, and
if you don't meet it, I'm going to kill all your

2520
03:17:15,596 --> 03:17:16,702
people.

2521
03:17:16,702 --> 03:17:18,389
(laughter)

2522
03:17:18,389 --> 03:17:20,678
TALIESIN: The glasses make that weirdly
threatening.

2523
03:17:20,678 --> 03:17:27,009
LIAM: (singing) It's Sergeant Pepper's Lonely
Heart Club Band.

2524
03:17:27,009 --> 03:17:29,675
MARISHA: New at Sundance!

2525
03:17:29,675 --> 03:17:34,829
MATT: Cool, guys. Thank you so much. Everyone
looks awesome. Happy Halloween, everyone!

2526
03:17:34,829 --> 03:17:36,151
ALL: Happy Halloween!

2527
03:17:36,151 --> 03:17:39,165
SAM: Hashtag Critical Costumes!

2528
03:17:39,165 --> 03:17:41,171
TALIESIN: Get candy from strangers.

2529
03:17:41,171 --> 03:17:43,785
MARISHA: Yeah, go knock on strangers' doors and
get candy from them.

2530
03:17:43,785 --> 03:17:48,481
TALIESIN: Do it! It's good for America. Eat candy
from strangers.

2531
03:17:48,481 --> 03:17:51,932
MARISHA: Totally inflated.

2532
03:17:51,932 --> 03:17:56,995
MATT: Rest well. We'll see you next week. (as
Victor) Is it Thursday yet?

2533
03:17:56,995 --> 03:24:38,981
